big guy?

00:29.840 --> 00:31.080
Oh, this is real fair.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.680
You're 200 pounds heavier.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.680
Shh.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.040
I'm not hurting him.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.800
I know. Just--shh.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.880
What are you doing?

00:37.880 --> 00:40.720
I want everyone
to be real quiet.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.760
Uh, hello.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.200
Everyone settle
and just listen.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.640
What are we listening for?

00:52.640 --> 00:54.080
Silence.

00:54.080 --> 00:57.120
Total silence.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.720
That's impossible. Absolute
silence doesn't exist.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.320
Yeah, there's always
something making noise.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.120
Exactly.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.760
So when grownups say
they want it quiet,

01:08.760 --> 01:10.720
there's no way,

01:10.720 --> 01:12.560
'cause there's
no such thing.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.520
I'll remember that.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.760
But what if there could be
total silence?

01:19.760 --> 01:23.880
What if you could stop
every sound, every buzz?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.560
Every breath?

01:25.560 --> 01:27.000
You couldn't.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.800
Where there's life,
there's sound.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.000
Say that another way.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.440
You take away sound,

01:33.440 --> 01:35.520

Come along, children.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.919
Pay attention, and we're off
to the children's library,

02:09.919 --> 02:12.760

many hours.

Ooh, Jace the face.
Lucky you... not.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.920
What's wrong with Jace?
I think he's kind of cute.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.560
Yeah, he thinks so, too.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.840
He's way conceited,
Laurie.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.960
He's not.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.520
Trust me. If his head
got any bigger,

04:03.520 --> 04:05.560
they'd put him
in a parade.

Laurie's OK.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.720
Come on. Her head's
got too many brains.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.360
If it were
any bigger,

04:15.360 --> 04:17.360
they'd put her
in a parade.

Check this out.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.920
My name is Laurie Napier.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.280
I may be a geek,
but that's OK,

04:22.280 --> 04:24.640

than you.

Get the books.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.560
Why don't you get them?

06:13.560 --> 06:16.760
Because I'm already
doing all the work.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.800
Because you won't
let me do anything.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.760

don't want to flunk.

my notebook?

at the library yesterday.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.640
Oh. Yeah,
that's right.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.880
I must have left it
in the basement.

I need those notes for
the paper. Go get it.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.520

I got practice.

the paper?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.240
You get it.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.160
But you left it there.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.040
That's 'cause I'm not
as smart as you are.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.640
I forget things.
I act like a kid.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.120
All right,
we'll both go.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.080
You got to show me
where you left it.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.760
I told you,
I got practice.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.320

that paper tonight.

not me.

flunked anything in my life.

It's OK. I forgot the

to be responsible

to the copy machine?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.040
[Heart beating]

17:53.560 --> 17:54.760
[Heartbeat stops]

17:56.680 --> 17:59.880
[Music plays]

18:07.120 --> 18:09.680
I'm going
to teach you a lesson,

18:09.680 --> 18:12.720
just like I do
to all loud children.

18:12.720 --> 18:16.400
My reading room is
so peaceful and quiet.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.200
You'll grow to like it,
just like all the others.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.920
[Chuckles]

18:29.000 --> 18:31.320
[Laughing]

18:38.160 --> 18:41.640
No, don't!
Leave him...

18:41.640 --> 18:42.840
[Laughing]

18:46.360 --> 18:50.760
I think it's time
you joined me downstairs.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.600
[Computer game
sound effects]

19:00.600 --> 19:04.160
No, stop it.
Stop it now.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.800
Stop it!

19:09.280 --> 19:10.960
Stop it now.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.840
Children who make noise
in the library

19:15.840 --> 19:17.080
must be punished.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.640
[Whump]
Ow!

19:34.040 --> 19:35.120
[Moaning]

19:57.680 --> 20:00.160
What are you kids
doing in here?

20:03.080 --> 20:05.040
How did you get in?

20:12.160 --> 20:13.760
What the...

20:16.600 --> 20:19.120
It--that was a...

20:19.120 --> 20:20.800
My voice is back!

20:20.800 --> 20:22.520
Mine too.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.920
The reading room.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.040
We found the missing kids.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.880
There's a door
behind there.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.000
Hurry.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.120
This door hasn't
been opened in years.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.640
Are you guys OK?

20:53.640 --> 20:56.480
Yeah, I think.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.680
Look in here.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.000
Wow. It's like
a tomb in here.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.040
I got to call this in.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.760
You kids stay put.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.080
[Children laughing]

21:21.440 --> 21:25.400
Whoever they were, I
think they're free now.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.320
[Laughter continues]

21:48.280 --> 21:50.880
They're never gonna
believe us, are they?

21:50.880 --> 21:52.880
I'm not sure
I believe us.

21:52.880 --> 21:56.880
You know, maybe we're not
such a bad team, after all.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.880
Is this anybody's?

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
My notebook.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.520
You kids can go now.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.680
If we need you,
we'll call.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.960
We still have to write
that paper.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.160
We?

22:13.160 --> 22:16.440
Come on.
Let's live dangerously.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.560
Cool story.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.360
Yeah. I never
knew silence

22:39.360 --> 22:41.680
could be so creepy.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.000
I declare
this meeting

22:43.000 --> 22:45.360
of the Midnight
Society closed.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.840
Speaking of libraries,
I have books to return.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.000
Does anyone want
to keep me company?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.560
But it's way past closing.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.280
I was gonna drop them
in the night slot.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.600
I got to go.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.880
Yeah.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.840
Oh, and look
at the time.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.840
Got to roll.
See you guys next time.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.160
<i> Hasta la vista.</i>

23:05.160 --> 23:06.160
Tucker?

23:06.160 --> 23:07.360
Bye.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.840
Come on! Just leave me
at the corner.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.840
You don't have to go
near the building.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.800
Guys?
