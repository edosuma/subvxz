01:43.187 --> 01:48.621
<i>unique in all history, the Mayans.</i>

01:48.692 --> 01:52.402
<i>Greece and Rome had become</i>
<i>ancient legends in ancient books,</i>

01:52.468 --> 01:56.940
<i>and the European cicilizations</i>
<i>had entered into the age of the barbarians.</i>

01:57.011 --> 01:59.728
<i>But in the tropical jungles</i>
<i>of Central America,</i>

01:59.796 --> 02:02.611
<i>a civilization had burst into full flower.</i>

02:02.676 --> 02:05.294
<i>Without metals, without horses,</i>
<i>without wheels,</i>

02:05.364 --> 02:09.193
<i>these incredible people</i>
<i>built roads, pyramids,</i>

02:09.267 --> 02:11.307
<i>temples worthy of ancient Egypt.</i>

02:11.379 --> 02:12.905
<i>They charted the heacens,</i>

02:12.979 --> 02:15.881
<i>decised a higher system</i>
<i>of mathematics than the Romans,</i>

02:15.955 --> 02:19.501
<i>and created a calendar as accurate</i>
<i>as the one we use today.</i>

02:21.715 --> 02:24.563
<i>But despite the maturity</i>
<i>of their art and their science,</i>

02:24.627 --> 02:26.635
<i>in the most important part of their lices,</i>

02:26.707 --> 02:30.123
<i>the worship of their gods,</i>
<i>they remained primitice.</i>

02:35.124 --> 02:38.736
Balam, the jaguar, eight times king!

02:48.819 --> 02:51.819
Balam, the prince!

02:51.891 --> 02:55.786
<i>NARRA TOR. To the Mayans, the gods were</i>
<i>demanding gods, fierce and greedy,</i>

02:55.859 --> 03:00.561
<i>granting nothing except for a price,</i>
<i>and that price was blood.</i>

03:00.627 --> 03:03.791
<i>ln their profound desire</i>
<i>to win facor from the deities,</i>

03:03.859 --> 03:07.471
<i>the Mayans made human sacrifice</i>
<i>the keystone of their religion.</i>

03:07.539 --> 03:10.092
<i>To die as a bearer</i>
<i>of a message to the gods</i>

03:10.163 --> 03:13.425
<i>was the most exalted honor</i>
<i>a man could experience,</i>

03:13.492 --> 03:19.656
<i>for when he was selected to be sacrificed,</i>
<i>in that moment, he himself became a god.</i>

03:19.732 --> 03:24.074
<i>He was worshiped as a god,</i>
<i>granted any wish that came into his heart,</i>

03:24.147 --> 03:26.635
<i>until the moment he was put to death.</i>

04:38.036 --> 04:40.075
<i>NARRA TOR. For centuries, in small,</i>
<i>scattered kingdoms,</i>

04:40.147 --> 04:44.042
<i>these people liced in peace</i>
<i>with themselces and their gods.</i>

04:44.115 --> 04:46.155
<i>But then came conquerors from the West,</i>

04:46.227 --> 04:48.267
<i>with metal swords,</i>
<i>which made them incincible</i>

04:48.339 --> 04:50.609
<i>against the wooden weapons</i>
<i>of the Mayans.</i>

04:50.676 --> 04:52.880
<i>One by one,</i>
<i>they swallowed up the little kingdoms,</i>

04:52.948 --> 04:57.006
<i>until the last, the final stronghold,</i>
<i>Chichén ltzá was theirs.</i>

04:57.075 --> 05:00.370
<i>And their leader, Hunac Kell,</i>
<i>already as cruel as any god,</i>

05:00.435 --> 05:02.825
<i>now felt himself as powerful as one.</i>

05:38.291 --> 05:42.186
l have served your father,
and l have loved you as a son.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.488
Now l shall serve you
and love you as my king.

05:48.083 --> 05:50.801
Balam ! Nine times king!

05:50.867 --> 05:54.609
Balam, the jaguar, nine times king!

05:56.211 --> 06:00.913
There is still time to let Hunac Kell
know that the Mayans are men.

06:00.978 --> 06:02.321
No!

06:02.387 --> 06:03.794
You must flee and preserve your life.

06:03.859 --> 06:05.452
And become a coward before Hunac Kell?

06:05.523 --> 06:07.978
You no longer belong to yourself, Balam.
You belong to your people.

06:08.051 --> 06:12.142
-And how do l serve them? By deserting?
-Dead, you desert your people.

06:13.971 --> 06:18.706
There's a time for fighting
and a time to make ready to fight.

06:18.771 --> 06:20.112
He speaks wisely.

06:20.179 --> 06:23.179
Let us lick our wounds, and then
make the invader choke on his sword.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.226
There is no place to run.

06:25.299 --> 06:26.990
Hunac Kell and his men
will scour the land.

06:27.059 --> 06:29.361
lf we are going to die, let us die here.

06:29.427 --> 06:32.874
l've said your life is not yours to lose.

06:34.226 --> 06:35.656
You're a king.

06:35.732 --> 06:37.324
Act like a king!

06:38.579 --> 06:42.224
We'll disperse,
join forces when we're strong again.

06:46.258 --> 06:50.416
Disperse?
No, that's the one thing we must never do.

06:50.484 --> 06:52.492
My father once told me
of an ancient legend,

06:52.563 --> 06:55.345
of the time of the great earthquakes
when the land shook like the sea,

06:55.411 --> 06:57.353
and men took to boats
and crossed the waters to the North.

06:57.426 --> 06:59.282
Cross the waters?
We'd slide off the world.

06:59.347 --> 07:03.024
The legend has no truth.
There's no record of it on any stele.

07:03.091 --> 07:04.499
My father told it to me, Priest.

07:04.564 --> 07:05.709
Ah Haleb.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.714
There is a fishing village on the coast
not 10 days journey from here.

07:08.786 --> 07:10.729
We will leave from there.

08:04.884 --> 08:08.625
Men do not vanish into air.
There is a hidden passage.

08:08.691 --> 08:12.008
Find it, and find the body of the king
and of his son as well.

08:12.083 --> 08:15.432
Until l know that not one drop
of that blood remains alive,

08:15.507 --> 08:17.646
l am not King of Chichén ltzá.

10:03.155 --> 10:04.911
ls your village near?

10:07.507 --> 10:09.514
This is your king, Balam.

10:10.386 --> 10:11.564
Answer.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.507
lt's just beyond that point.

10:56.115 --> 10:59.082
We'll take to the boats
and cross the great sea.

10:59.155 --> 11:00.878
But you will all die.

11:02.131 --> 11:04.302
The legend says nothing
about boats coming back.

11:04.371 --> 11:07.983
The legend does say that land was found.
Who brought back the word?

11:08.051 --> 11:10.058
But why do your soldiers take our fish?

11:10.131 --> 11:12.040
The catch will be useful to us
on the voyage.

11:12.114 --> 11:15.148
-How many boats do you have?
-What you see there.

11:17.171 --> 11:19.658
We will need all of them.

11:19.731 --> 11:24.848
-The king has means of payment?
-No. But it will please the gods.

11:24.914 --> 11:27.762
And be very displeasing
to the boat owners.

11:27.826 --> 11:29.550
Seize this man who puts men before gods.

11:29.651 --> 11:30.731
Wait!

11:33.362 --> 11:36.046
You do acknowledge that l am your king?

11:36.114 --> 11:39.213
Kings have always seemed far away.

11:40.562 --> 11:43.977
Small in the distance like wars.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.155
And defeated kings even smaller.

11:48.531 --> 11:53.005
Listen, old man, tell your people
to fill every boat with supplies

11:53.076 --> 11:55.595
and anything else that will be useful to us
in the new land.

11:55.666 --> 11:59.015
-But how will we live after you go?
-Your people are coming with me.

11:59.091 --> 12:01.000
To cross the water to their death?

12:01.074 --> 12:04.074
lf crossing the waters frightens you,
then you know little of Hunac Kell.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.253
Every soldier that you see here
was once a hundred,

12:06.324 --> 12:07.697
and their women are now slaves.

12:07.763 --> 12:11.079
To my people, slavery may sound better
than the unknown.

12:11.155 --> 12:14.221
l have ordered you and your people
to come with me.

12:14.291 --> 12:16.079
Now tell them !

12:16.147 --> 12:19.147
ln spite of your youth,
you have the habit of command,

12:19.219 --> 12:20.779
but habit is not always enough.

12:20.850 --> 12:22.127
You dare to disobey?

12:22.194 --> 12:25.194
This is Balam, king and son of kings
to the ninth generation.

12:25.267 --> 12:28.780
And a stranger here.
My people respect the voice they know.

12:28.852 --> 12:31.720
-Then give them the word.
-lf l refuse?

12:31.794 --> 12:34.249
-Ordinarily, l kill only as a duty.
-Leave him !

12:34.322 --> 12:36.624
-Who is this girl?
-My daughter, lxchel.

12:36.691 --> 12:38.666
lnstruct your father,
he does not argue with the king.

12:38.739 --> 12:42.514
And has the king the right to order
our people to their death?

12:43.411 --> 12:46.280
Until today this was a place of peace.

12:46.354 --> 12:49.388
l will not surrender to Hunac Kell.

12:49.458 --> 12:53.453
We must go to a new land
and grow strong and then come back.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.140
Men alone cannot build a new race
in a new land.

12:56.210 --> 12:59.025
That is why l need your people,
your women and your children.

12:59.091 --> 13:00.879
Now tell them to get into the boats.

13:00.946 --> 13:06.064
You are a new king, Balam,
young and brave and untried.

13:06.131 --> 13:07.756
lf my people go with you,

13:07.826 --> 13:10.695
they will have many doubts
and great fears.

13:10.770 --> 13:14.000
You should have someone at your side
whom they know and love.

13:14.067 --> 13:17.329
l do not wear my father's crown
to share it with you.

13:17.395 --> 13:19.435
Not with me, Balam.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.816
With your queen, my daughter, lxchel.

13:27.378 --> 13:30.379
When the time comes,
l shall choose my own queen.

13:30.451 --> 13:34.095
To my people, l am as royal as you,
so is my daughter.

13:34.162 --> 13:38.222
Priests and soldiers in a womanless land.

13:38.291 --> 13:41.968
Are you destined
to be king of a dying race, Balam?

13:50.515 --> 13:53.264
Hunac Kell. Less than a league away.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.296
Hunac Kell is not a league away.

14:01.363 --> 14:06.185
You have not felt his wrath, we have.
He is completely without mercy.

14:06.259 --> 14:09.161
His strength is a sword of metal,
and we are powerless against it.

14:09.234 --> 14:10.728
So you have no choice.

14:10.802 --> 14:14.120
lf we are all to survive,
you must come with me at once.

14:14.195 --> 14:17.905
So l order you, gather your belongings
and go to the boats.

14:20.371 --> 14:22.410
-Obey your king!
-They await my word.

14:22.482 --> 14:25.166
-Then give it.
-After you have given me yours.

14:25.234 --> 14:27.536
Will your greed
settle for nothing less, old man?

14:27.602 --> 14:31.050
-Nothing less.
-We could take all of his people by force.

14:32.787 --> 14:34.891
And be another Hunac Kell?

14:37.106 --> 14:39.146
Very well.

14:39.218 --> 14:42.797
lf l live, l will marry her in the new land.

14:42.867 --> 14:45.735
-The king vows this?
-By the gods, l swear it.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.032
Obey the king!

14:54.707 --> 14:58.001
Why did you do that?
Do you think l have no pride?

14:58.066 --> 15:01.862
When you share his throne,
you will have no need to speak of pride.

15:06.899 --> 15:09.615
Hurry! Load as fast as you can!

15:20.466 --> 15:21.578
Hurry!

16:21.458 --> 16:24.873
-Leave him ! Leave him !
-Please!

16:30.675 --> 16:31.755
Away!

16:33.458 --> 16:35.247
No! No!

16:54.291 --> 16:57.552
The sea is not big enough
to keep us apart, Balam.

16:57.618 --> 17:00.465
Wherever you go, l will find you!

17:31.570 --> 17:35.082
lxchel, l've tried so many times to tell you,

17:35.154 --> 17:38.286
l do grieve with you
for the death of your father.

17:39.698 --> 17:42.732
Yet there was a time
when you wanted it yourself.

17:49.682 --> 17:52.552
The enemy killed your father, lxchel,
not the king.

17:52.627 --> 17:54.961
And who brought the enemy upon us?

17:59.539 --> 18:03.216
When a man must think of many,
it's not easy to think of one.

18:24.434 --> 18:30.185
Oh, God of Waters, the winds forsake us,
our men weaken and die.

18:31.442 --> 18:34.507
l plead with you, do not abandon us.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.631
We've lost another boat.

19:22.706 --> 19:27.278
The god of the waters has abandoned us.
Turn back before it's too late.

19:27.347 --> 19:31.438
You know the danger that lies behind.
There cannot be greater danger ahead.

19:31.507 --> 19:35.598
lt is not our lives Hunac Kell wants,
it's yours, Balam.

19:35.666 --> 19:40.009
Fear presses down upon you, Priest.
Why not use your power? Pray for wind!

19:40.082 --> 19:43.879
Balam, listen to me,
as you'd have listened to your father.

19:43.954 --> 19:45.776
l now believe this voyage was doomed

19:45.842 --> 19:48.363
from the moment
we did not make sacrifice.

19:48.435 --> 19:50.377
There are things
that belong to the gods, Balam.

19:50.451 --> 19:52.174
And things that belong to man.

19:52.242 --> 19:56.552
ln the name of all that we hold sacred,
give the word to turn back or l will.

19:56.626 --> 19:59.561
-Do so and it will be your last.
-l, too, say we should go back.

19:59.634 --> 20:01.194
Go back to what?

20:01.266 --> 20:04.682
An honorable death.
Once we both wanted that.

20:04.754 --> 20:08.202
Must we all die for you, Balam?

20:08.274 --> 20:10.216
Women and children, too?

21:22.321 --> 21:26.413
There is new land beneath our feet
and a new life lies before us.

21:29.266 --> 21:32.943
Let us then begin
with new feelings in our hearts,

21:33.874 --> 21:36.624
old fears and old memories
to be forgotten.

21:37.554 --> 21:40.783
From this time on,
it shall be as though we are reborn.

21:43.283 --> 21:46.217
Before we left the old land, l made a vow,

21:46.290 --> 21:50.481
that if we arrived here safely,
l would make lxchel my queen.

21:50.547 --> 21:54.824
Now, before all of you, l keep my word.

21:56.178 --> 21:59.527
Priest, as the first act in this new land,

21:59.603 --> 22:02.505
prepare to perform this marriage
as soon as possible.

22:02.579 --> 22:05.874
There will be no need.
You were forced to take that vow.

22:05.939 --> 22:07.345
Nonetheless it is sacred.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.319
And that vow was made to my father.

22:09.394 --> 22:10.855
And to these people
who bore witness to it.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.166
lt was made to everyone but me.

22:14.065 --> 22:17.383
But no longer need you feel
the prisoner of a promise.

22:18.354 --> 22:22.248
My father is dead,
and l release you from that vow.

22:32.082 --> 22:33.904
There is much to be done.

22:33.969 --> 22:37.318
We must clear the land,
build a temple to our gods

22:37.394 --> 22:39.249
and houses for ourselves.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.386
Our task will be hard.

22:44.882 --> 22:48.078
But with faith, we shall endure.

22:53.971 --> 22:59.437
Oh, God, lord of hills and valleys,
be patient with us

22:59.506 --> 23:02.124
for we are about to destroy your beauty.

23:02.194 --> 23:03.601
Suffer it, we pray you,

23:03.667 --> 23:06.252
so that we may dwell here
and obtain our daily bread,

23:06.322 --> 23:08.656
for in us there is a great hunger.

23:09.810 --> 23:12.527
Send us the many blessings of thy bounty,

23:12.594 --> 23:17.417
the life-giving sun,
the blessed rain, the fertility of the soil.

23:18.962 --> 23:22.442
We pray you to suffer
no animal to attack us,

23:22.514 --> 23:24.424
nor enemy to kill us.

25:47.249 --> 25:48.973
lt is a sense l have.

25:49.042 --> 25:52.719
Because we saw one canoe
does not mean invaders have come.

25:53.810 --> 25:56.460
The canoe is like none we've ever seen.

25:57.874 --> 26:01.103
Where there is one there could be many.

26:02.449 --> 26:06.890
As your chief,
l say strange boats carry strange people.

26:08.657 --> 26:12.716
lf the council agrees,
l will search for these strangers.

26:13.938 --> 26:17.648
lf l find them, l will bring back one.

26:18.738 --> 26:21.389
lsatai, you will come with me.

26:21.458 --> 26:23.662
One may have to watch,

26:23.730 --> 26:26.380
the other must return
with word to the council.

26:36.241 --> 26:37.583
We have been looking for these strangers

26:37.650 --> 26:40.072
for more than five times
this number of days.

26:40.146 --> 26:43.015
-And we'll look more.
-Maybe there are no strangers.

26:43.090 --> 26:45.261
Maybe there was nothing more
than a big canoe.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.337
Then we'll find that out.

27:42.962 --> 27:46.344
-There is no need for you to do this.
-My place is with my people.

27:46.417 --> 27:49.516
Now they're Balam's people.
You should be their queen.

27:49.586 --> 27:53.415
lxchel, your father was wiser than that.

27:53.490 --> 27:56.938
A king is a lonely man,
perhaps the loneliest man on earth.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.438
Your father understood that.

27:58.513 --> 28:02.223
He knew that for Balam to rule wisely
he needed someone at his side.

28:02.289 --> 28:06.251
Someone he could confide in,
trust and love.

28:07.570 --> 28:09.457
Both of you are lonely.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.489
lf he is lonely,
why doesn't he tell me himself?

30:32.465 --> 30:35.182
How much longer
must you keep our farmers piling dirt

30:35.249 --> 30:37.257
when they should be planting corn?

30:37.330 --> 30:38.278
Until the temple is completed,

30:38.354 --> 30:42.151
l cannot determine the day
the gods will favor our planting.

30:42.226 --> 30:46.153
And there's been no rain.
Perhaps it never rains here.

30:46.225 --> 30:49.160
We will not have to wait for rain.
Come with me.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.254
lxchel works harder than any.
l told her she belongs with you.

31:02.321 --> 31:03.728
lt is no concern of yours, Priest.

31:03.794 --> 31:06.128
My concern is with everyone here,
beginning with the king.

31:06.195 --> 31:09.161
Before everyone l offered her marriage
and before everyone she made...

31:09.233 --> 31:12.495
Because of a vow.
She's a woman. Go to her again.

31:12.562 --> 31:15.115
-l am a king, l cannot plead.
-She will listen.

31:15.186 --> 31:17.455
To degrade me again?

31:33.778 --> 31:39.626
l have in mind to build a wall of stone here
so that the water will be held back.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.861
And then to dig ditches
from here to the fields.

31:42.930 --> 31:45.799
And then
we'll never have to depend upon rain.

31:48.434 --> 31:51.282
This, l think, would be the place to start.

31:54.066 --> 31:58.375
lt may be done, Balam,
but first you must sacrifice.

31:58.449 --> 32:01.035
This stream will become
the lifeblood of our village.

32:01.106 --> 32:04.367
The God of Waters must be given a life
in honest exchange.

32:04.434 --> 32:07.565
All work on the pyramid must,
for the moment, stop

32:09.009 --> 32:13.482
until we have built this wall of stone
and prepared the fields for planting.

32:14.129 --> 32:15.820
That is my command.

32:33.681 --> 32:36.910
Tell your people that Black Eagle
has taken your chief,

32:36.978 --> 32:39.825
and my warriors
will destroy the rest of you.

33:44.850 --> 33:46.256
Let him live.

33:46.321 --> 33:49.038
We have our offering to the God of Waters.

36:16.241 --> 36:19.656
The barbarian has a killing wound
but he seems too strong to die.

36:19.729 --> 36:21.387
l have felt that strength.

36:21.457 --> 36:24.840
But how do we know the offering
of a barbarian will please the gods?

36:24.914 --> 36:29.932
We are strangers here, he is of this land.
No one could better serve our need.

36:30.001 --> 36:32.718
And we must see to it
that he is made well.

36:36.274 --> 36:39.340
Where there's one there must be others,
perhaps thousands

36:39.410 --> 36:41.581
and every one of them
looking for their chief.

36:41.649 --> 36:44.038
Post guards around the village
and send out more searchers.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.640
lt will be done.

36:53.969 --> 36:56.687
You have done enough for today.
You may go.

37:10.737 --> 37:11.947
lxchel.

37:18.481 --> 37:20.172
There is...

37:23.696 --> 37:26.479
There is something
l have wanted to tell you.

37:30.226 --> 37:33.608
l have wanted to tell you
that l know how hard you work.

37:35.345 --> 37:39.405
All of your people work very hard
and l am grateful.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.336
l will tell them.

38:06.354 --> 38:09.517
-He will let no one near him.
-lt's like trying to help a wild animal.

38:09.585 --> 38:11.494
Go back to him and heal his wounds.

38:11.569 --> 38:13.871
A life offered to the gods
must be a whole one.

38:13.937 --> 38:15.694
He frightens me.

38:15.762 --> 38:17.070
l will try.

38:19.537 --> 38:20.966
Say nothing of the sacrifice.

38:21.041 --> 38:25.034
He will be informed at the appointed time
and in the appointed way.

41:44.657 --> 41:47.339
He's like a wild animal
because he's being treated like one.

41:47.408 --> 41:49.132
Remember, he tried to kill the king.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.918
And remember that your high priest
has chosen him for sacrifice

41:51.985 --> 41:54.319
and he should be properly honored.

41:56.689 --> 41:58.030
Rest easy, Balam.

41:58.096 --> 42:01.413
lf the barbarians are out there,
the searchers will find them.

42:01.489 --> 42:06.442
l only remember how Black Eagle
appeared like a spirit, from nowhere.

42:14.736 --> 42:18.446
When l am asleep,
my eyes cannot see you.

42:22.448 --> 42:26.823
During the long time of darkness
it seemed that l had died.

42:28.721 --> 42:30.182
l hate death.

42:31.665 --> 42:36.301
l remembered the living.
l was angry, it was taken from me.

42:38.928 --> 42:40.620
Then l saw a woman.

42:42.738 --> 42:44.908
l reached out and touched her.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.252
And then l knew l was alive.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.648
But why?

43:00.432 --> 43:01.927
Why am l alive?

43:03.536 --> 43:05.260
Why are you healing me?

43:06.961 --> 43:08.138
Why?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.681
Please sleep now.

44:03.089 --> 44:05.228
Now l will sleep.

44:09.041 --> 44:10.950
Black Eagle was right.

44:11.024 --> 44:14.123
They are people
such as we have never seen before.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.462
They live in a big place by the sea.

44:16.529 --> 44:18.089
Their dwellings
are made of wood and stone

44:18.160 --> 44:20.365
and are fastened to the ground.

44:20.976 --> 44:23.496
They have built a tall mound of earth.

44:25.041 --> 44:28.783
That mound will guide us
to where we will avenge our chief.

45:36.048 --> 45:39.397
-How is Black Eagle?
-With me, as violent as ever.

45:39.472 --> 45:41.261
Only lxchel can touch him.

46:09.456 --> 46:11.278
You look tired, lxchel.

46:14.992 --> 46:18.702
-Because of you l understand he will live.
-l will.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.848
l will not disappoint you.

46:33.872 --> 46:37.036
And l promise you
a much better fight than the last.

46:40.145 --> 46:42.478
You have skill l have not known.

46:43.601 --> 46:46.088
-Where do you come from?
-From across the great sea.

46:46.160 --> 46:49.357
-What do you want on my land?
-To live here.

46:49.424 --> 46:51.660
This land belongs to my people.

46:52.720 --> 46:57.063
There have been many intruders before
and we have always driven them away.

46:58.288 --> 47:01.256
But if your warriors
have some of your skill,

47:02.896 --> 47:05.766
then this will be the greatest battle of all.

47:08.944 --> 47:10.188
Balam,

47:11.344 --> 47:14.378
practice with your sword, you will need it.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.153
Balam.

47:26.064 --> 47:27.788
Your woman is beauty.

47:38.225 --> 47:40.396
Why do you call me his woman?

47:41.713 --> 47:43.372
Because he is chief

47:44.529 --> 47:47.016
and you are
the most beautiful woman here.

47:48.784 --> 47:50.956
You haven't seen many of the others.

47:53.777 --> 47:55.304
l don't have to see.

47:56.432 --> 47:57.610
l know.

48:00.849 --> 48:02.637
You must lie down now.

48:09.137 --> 48:11.307
What do you give me now?

48:11.375 --> 48:14.093
lt is from our land. lt will make you well.

48:19.697 --> 48:21.551
Balam is a good fighter

48:23.152 --> 48:24.744
but he is a fool.

48:25.873 --> 48:27.563
Why do you say that?

48:31.761 --> 48:33.648
lf you are not his woman,

48:34.608 --> 48:36.495
then he is a fool.

48:46.416 --> 48:49.231
And it would be good to fight for that, too.

49:04.401 --> 49:06.473
l am a man of faith, Priest,

49:08.176 --> 49:12.234
but you must know
l have no love for human sacrifice.

49:14.544 --> 49:18.472
l questioned it in our land
and l question it even more here.

49:20.689 --> 49:23.372
Why must this man
be put to death, Priest?

49:23.920 --> 49:27.815
A sacrifice to the gods
is not a personal matter.

49:27.888 --> 49:29.895
lt's a holy act for the good of our people.

49:29.968 --> 49:32.303
Your feelings are of no importance.

49:33.329 --> 49:37.071
As king you will have to do many things
you may not like.

49:39.024 --> 49:44.076
When you do them for your people,
without hesitation,

49:44.144 --> 49:47.177
then you will be truly king.

49:58.832 --> 50:01.418
You will instruct him to put these on.

50:02.384 --> 50:03.910
He will ask why.

50:04.241 --> 50:07.275
As soon as he's properly attired,
we will answer.

50:37.745 --> 50:40.079
Such a long time you were gone.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.448
-For you.
-For me? Why?

50:47.024 --> 50:49.326
lt came with us across the water.

50:50.768 --> 50:52.459
lt has great beauty.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.310
Our people can do many things.

50:55.377 --> 50:56.806
Your people.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.298
Can your people jump on a buffalo
and ride it?

51:00.368 --> 51:03.913
-What is a buffalo?
-lt is a bull as tall as this house,

51:04.721 --> 51:09.161
its horns long as my arms,
when it runs the earth shakes.

51:09.616 --> 51:13.097
And our babies
lead them around by their noses.

51:14.928 --> 51:17.263
How can your babies reach so high?

51:18.864 --> 51:20.904
You haven't seen our babies.

51:29.744 --> 51:31.686
Why am l being given this?

51:39.120 --> 51:41.324
-To honor you.
-Honor?

51:42.768 --> 51:44.362
A ceremony?

51:50.768 --> 51:52.011
l know.

51:53.520 --> 51:56.684
Your king has decided
to let me return to my people.

51:59.120 --> 52:00.908
lt is true.

52:00.975 --> 52:04.041
Balam is not only brave, but wise, too.

52:05.136 --> 52:07.242
l will carry back good words.

52:12.719 --> 52:15.720
And when l leave,
l want you to come with me.

52:21.169 --> 52:24.484
No one has ever been
as gentle with me as you, lxchel.

52:25.648 --> 52:27.622
And l have come to love you.

52:28.912 --> 52:30.766
l want you for my wife.

52:31.856 --> 52:33.285
And someday

52:34.192 --> 52:37.967
we will watch our babies
lead buffalo around by their noses.

52:52.753 --> 52:54.214
lxchel.

53:56.721 --> 53:58.793
-Speak, Priest.
-Yes.

54:00.431 --> 54:02.341
Tell me of the ceremony.

54:03.120 --> 54:06.436
Our religion teaches
that we may send messengers to our gods

54:06.512 --> 54:11.367
to offer our prayers, our hopes,
to ask for good things for our people.

54:11.439 --> 54:15.018
Black Eagle, you have been chosen
to bear our words.

54:15.088 --> 54:19.628
The man thus chosen to look upon
our gods is honored before all other men.

54:19.697 --> 54:21.606
He becomes himself a god.

54:22.224 --> 54:24.940
Our people already look on you
as more than human.

54:25.007 --> 54:27.244
They offer prayers in your name.

54:31.889 --> 54:34.954
-Prayers?
-You'll be taken to the stone of sacrifice,

54:35.023 --> 54:38.340
and thereafter you will live with the gods
for all eternity.

54:47.184 --> 54:48.394
You knew.

54:54.896 --> 54:59.019
And lxchel, she knew, too.

55:01.167 --> 55:04.234
The time for the sacrifice
has been set for tomorrow.

55:04.304 --> 55:07.752
Until then you may have anything
in our power to give.

55:08.880 --> 55:12.556
A child born to you now
would have the qualities of a god.

55:12.623 --> 55:14.663
lt would grace our people.

55:14.735 --> 55:18.892
Any of our maidens would be blessed
if you summoned her to be your bride.

55:28.207 --> 55:29.418
lxchel.

55:36.111 --> 55:37.705
Send me lxchel.

55:50.352 --> 55:53.669
lt is time to prepare
to unite Black Eagle with lxchel.

55:58.768 --> 56:00.458
l will not permit it.

56:00.912 --> 56:04.557
Your people trust you, Balam.
Do not betray them.

56:23.759 --> 56:25.320
As your king,

56:26.928 --> 56:29.350
l am required to inform you that...

56:30.672 --> 56:33.356
That Black Eagle has summoned you.

56:33.424 --> 56:34.765
Yes, l know.

56:41.584 --> 56:43.559
You must be very honored.

56:44.816 --> 56:46.278
Deeply honored.

56:47.631 --> 56:48.842
Then go.

57:10.863 --> 57:12.903
He might've said one word.

57:14.448 --> 57:15.941
One single word.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.337
He wished Black Eagle
had chosen another.

57:26.224 --> 57:29.933
-She went without question, Priest.
-What could she question?

57:31.632 --> 57:35.341
She might have said
that she'd wished she'd not been so...

57:35.407 --> 57:37.130
So honored.

57:37.199 --> 57:39.207
You did not try to stop her?

57:40.848 --> 57:41.895
No.

57:42.895 --> 57:44.685
You are a king, Balam.

58:16.207 --> 58:21.511
The last time you came here
you brought me a cape of many feathers.

58:24.175 --> 58:28.616
l held you in my arms
and asked you to be my wife.

58:32.048 --> 58:35.430
Now you come here as my bride

58:40.239 --> 58:42.127
but not the way l asked.

58:45.744 --> 58:47.270
My bride,

58:50.031 --> 58:51.525
until tomorrow,

58:52.944 --> 58:55.498
when your priests will come to kill me.

58:58.319 --> 58:59.497
Honor?

59:00.495 --> 59:01.924
Slaughtered.

59:02.608 --> 59:04.943
-Slaughtered for superstition.
-No.

59:05.008 --> 59:07.396
But father a god for you first,

59:07.472 --> 59:11.148
then make your crops grow with my blood
and be honored.

59:12.751 --> 59:15.402
lt is being honored. lt's our religion.

59:18.799 --> 59:20.939
lt is not the dying,

59:23.279 --> 59:25.188
it is the manner of it.

59:29.872 --> 59:32.327
You robbed me of a warrior's death.

59:34.384 --> 59:36.358
You brought me back to life.

59:38.447 --> 59:41.797
You allowed me to believe
l was returning to my people.

59:45.871 --> 59:47.627
You let me love you.

59:49.872 --> 59:51.365
Father a god!

59:52.079 --> 59:54.567
But l don't want a son who is a god.

59:56.048 --> 01:00:00.749
l only want a son
who will be brave as a child

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.648
leading buffalo around by the nose.

01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:09.129
Then why did you ask for me?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.905
l wanted you to feel my hate,

01:00:22.895 --> 01:00:25.382
as l once wanted you to feel my love.

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.635
You sent her away.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.206
l want nothing

01:01:05.168 --> 01:01:06.793
from any of you.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.951
- The time has come.
- He refuses to wear this.

01:02:04.848 --> 01:02:08.776
Soon you will be a Mayan god.
lt is fitting that you dress as one.

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:16.133
lf the spirits in your heavens
can change me into a god,

01:02:18.095 --> 01:02:20.484
they can change my clothes as well.

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:53.960
You will carry this petition
in the name of our king and of our people.

01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:56.814
We ask only peace
and the fruits of our labor,

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.101
the blessings of the sun and the rain
and of the richness of the earth.

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:20.782
Blessings of the sun and the rain.

01:05:23.055 --> 01:05:24.877
Richness of the earth.

01:05:25.774 --> 01:05:27.684
You are fools.

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.789
Look around you, Balam.

01:05:33.008 --> 01:05:35.341
The grass has always grown for us

01:05:36.271 --> 01:05:38.889
and the trees spread their branches,

01:05:40.302 --> 01:05:42.637
the rivers have flowed

01:05:42.703 --> 01:05:45.933
and my people
have always enjoyed these blessings.

01:05:47.823 --> 01:05:50.279
My people are the fiercest on earth.

01:05:51.087 --> 01:05:53.902
Our land is red
with the blood of our enemies.

01:05:55.343 --> 01:05:56.871
But never,

01:05:58.032 --> 01:06:01.380
never have we shed one drop of blood
in sacrifice.

01:06:02.832 --> 01:06:05.221
And never have we groveled in fear.

01:06:10.671 --> 01:06:12.710
And l tell you this, Balam.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.100
Never, so long as l breathe
one breath of life,

01:06:18.863 --> 01:06:21.035
will l ever submit to this.

01:06:31.503 --> 01:06:33.511
You will carry our message.

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:39.912
But not to our gods, to your people.

01:06:41.424 --> 01:06:45.166
We asked for peace. We still ask for it.

01:06:50.703 --> 01:06:51.848
Peace?

01:06:53.679 --> 01:06:56.135
That choice will have to lie
with my people.

01:06:56.208 --> 01:06:59.305
Go to them and carry my words.

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:04.228
l give you your freedom.

01:07:08.687 --> 01:07:09.897
Take it.

01:07:22.127 --> 01:07:25.924
Balam, l have tried to make you know.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.650
You cannot bring this new life
to our people

01:07:28.719 --> 01:07:31.207
without first giving a life.

01:07:31.279 --> 01:07:34.694
For a thousand years
we've been bound by this law.

01:07:34.767 --> 01:07:37.036
The gods cannot be cheated.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.509
Barbarians!

01:08:34.575 --> 01:08:37.421
Soldiers to your posts.
Women to your houses.

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:43.109
-l have set him free.
-Release him.

01:09:06.926 --> 01:09:10.026
When he rejoins his people,
their strength will be doubled.

01:09:10.095 --> 01:09:12.778
The king has set him free. Open the gates.

01:09:43.407 --> 01:09:46.984
There was something in what he said
that made me trust him.

01:09:48.301 --> 01:09:51.401
Yet the man
who was closest to me on earth is dead,

01:09:53.198 --> 01:09:55.751
and the man
who swore to destroy us lives.

01:10:57.231 --> 01:11:01.835
For the first time in many days
my eyes are happy.

01:11:01.902 --> 01:11:04.291
Why did they let you go?

01:11:04.367 --> 01:11:06.342
They let me go
because their chief wants peace.

01:11:06.415 --> 01:11:09.350
They must be cowards! They fear us!

01:11:09.424 --> 01:11:13.165
No, they are no cowards.
They fear no one but their gods.

01:11:17.743 --> 01:11:23.111
You have chosen me to be your chief,
not to command but to guide you.

01:11:25.934 --> 01:11:28.520
Now, these are my words.

01:11:34.894 --> 01:11:38.571
There have been other intruders
in our land,

01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:41.606
but never people such as these.

01:11:41.679 --> 01:11:45.225
They have wisdom
that is different from ours.

01:11:46.926 --> 01:11:49.959
They have skills, knowledge.

01:11:54.415 --> 01:11:58.092
l am thinking
we can learn from these people,

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:04.101
if we live at their side in peace.

01:12:04.174 --> 01:12:06.858
We have never lived
at the side of any intruder.

01:12:06.927 --> 01:12:08.935
- l speak for war.
- War! Yes! War!

01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:14.473
War! War! War! War! War!

01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:19.082
As long as l'm your chief
you will listen to my words.

01:12:20.623 --> 01:12:23.404
When those words
do not reach your hearts,

01:12:25.263 --> 01:12:29.322
then it is your right to look among you,

01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:32.527
and choose a new chief.

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:15.467
Go back to your house.

01:13:37.198 --> 01:13:38.857
They've chosen war.

01:13:41.198 --> 01:13:42.476
Load.

01:13:46.799 --> 01:13:47.944
Wait.

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.110
Balam.

01:15:29.647 --> 01:15:33.476
My people call themselves,
''Wanderers on the Earth,''

01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:38.504
but where this large fire burns,
it means that Black Eagle is there,

01:15:38.575 --> 01:15:41.225
and the wanderers have come to rest.

01:15:41.294 --> 01:15:42.986
And where did they get the wood
for this fire?

01:15:43.055 --> 01:15:45.357
Look at our stockade.

01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:49.415
We needed firewood and we took it.
We always take what we need.

01:15:51.919 --> 01:15:56.524
lf we are to live together in peace,
there must be no wall between us.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:06.957
Balam, l will try
to make my people understand

01:16:07.023 --> 01:16:11.016
that they must change some of their ways
and learn some of yours.

01:16:11.086 --> 01:16:14.053
And we have much to learn from you.

01:16:14.126 --> 01:16:17.739
The last time l saw your village,
l was a prisoner.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.748
Now l would like to see it with new eyes.

01:16:27.214 --> 01:16:29.800
This is the writing l spoke of.

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:31.626
What is he putting down now?

01:16:31.694 --> 01:16:34.793
He is telling how we journeyed
across the waters to a new land,

01:16:34.863 --> 01:16:37.099
and of the new people we have met.

01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:38.628
-About me?
-Yes.

01:16:43.534 --> 01:16:45.607
Which one is me?

01:16:45.679 --> 01:16:48.232
The crops, they grow in this new land.

01:16:48.878 --> 01:16:51.660
The crops, they grow, they grow!

01:18:03.214 --> 01:18:04.708
See that they do no damage.

01:18:04.782 --> 01:18:06.757
lt seems the gods received your message,

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.864
even though
Black Eagle never delivered it.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.716
The crops grow faster in this new land
than they did at home.

01:18:12.782 --> 01:18:15.019
And without human blood
to nourish them.

01:18:15.086 --> 01:18:17.420
Have you forgotten so soon about Ah Min?

01:18:17.486 --> 01:18:19.396
That he gave his life for this?

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:22.089
l have not forgotten Ah Min.

01:18:22.159 --> 01:18:26.314
But we made this field ready,
we planted the seed,

01:18:26.381 --> 01:18:28.771
and we brought the water.

01:18:28.846 --> 01:18:31.530
This crop grew without sacrifice.

01:18:32.783 --> 01:18:35.881
How can you make
Ah Min's death seem so worthless?

01:18:36.398 --> 01:18:37.892
He loved you.

01:18:38.478 --> 01:18:40.136
And l loved him.

01:18:41.389 --> 01:18:44.324
And l wish he were here now to see this.

01:18:48.942 --> 01:18:52.357
You see how the king denies our religion.

01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:55.213
lf he is not stopped,
he will bring destruction on all of us.

01:19:37.486 --> 01:19:39.275
What strange skins.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.599
-Where did they come from?
-We hunted them.

01:19:42.671 --> 01:19:44.263
We've never seen such animals.

01:19:44.334 --> 01:19:47.182
-Aren't they beautiful?
-lf you like them.

01:19:53.262 --> 01:19:57.900
lf you had hunted these animals yourself,
you'd have a higher opinion of them.

01:20:32.654 --> 01:20:36.931
l look upon you as one of us,
as one of my people.

01:20:40.462 --> 01:20:44.586
Remember all those times in my hut
when we were alone,

01:20:44.654 --> 01:20:47.622
l asked you to be my woman
and bear my sons.

01:20:49.038 --> 01:20:50.598
But you didn't answer me.

01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:53.353
Your lips are not sealed anymore, lxchel.

01:20:53.421 --> 01:20:55.561
Say now you will be my bride.

01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:11.274
Go to him ! Be his woman! Bear his sons!

01:21:12.398 --> 01:21:15.268
Before when he summoned you,
you went to him willingly.

01:21:15.342 --> 01:21:18.887
And now l know
it was not for the first time.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:20.485
Balam, wait.

01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:22.601
Balam !

01:21:38.445 --> 01:21:39.624
No!

01:22:01.454 --> 01:22:05.578
Our people cannot live together.
There is a wall between us.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:56.939
Being rooted like trees
never was meant for us.

01:22:58.702 --> 01:23:02.182
l take my people to where we belong,

01:23:02.253 --> 01:23:04.937
where there is no roof but the sky,

01:23:05.006 --> 01:23:08.551
where there are no walls
to the edges of the earth.

01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:11.404
l take them to where birds sing for us,

01:23:12.717 --> 01:23:16.067
and where we live free like the deer.

01:23:17.421 --> 01:23:19.145
l would go with you.

01:23:19.918 --> 01:23:22.984
l'd never leave your side except...

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:25.674
Balam.

01:23:26.509 --> 01:23:31.332
l'm proud that you would fight for me
and grateful.

01:23:31.407 --> 01:23:34.276
But l know what l felt
when l thought he was going to die.

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:37.284
After his words to you
he should have died.

01:23:37.358 --> 01:23:41.798
But his words were the first words
he ever used to tell me that he loved me.

01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:50.794
Hunac Kell.

01:25:17.581 --> 01:25:20.680
Balam's old enemy with metal swords
has found him.

01:25:24.462 --> 01:25:26.371
They will destroy Balam.

01:25:29.133 --> 01:25:32.646
- Sound the battle drums.
l thought you wanted him dead.

01:25:37.454 --> 01:25:39.210
Until now, so did l.

01:25:55.246 --> 01:25:58.662
Our king defies the gods
and we are powerless against him.

01:25:58.734 --> 01:26:01.385
He is at the root of all our troubles.

01:26:01.454 --> 01:26:04.552
But if Balam were dead, you could lead us,

01:26:04.622 --> 01:26:07.720
and we could still make our peace
with Hunac Kell.

01:27:54.447 --> 01:27:58.986
Balam, if you surrender,
l will spare your people!

01:28:02.157 --> 01:28:06.348
Your life, Balam,
for the lives of your people!

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:11.749
lf you do not surrender,
every man, woman and child will perish!

01:30:47.278 --> 01:30:48.423
Pitz!

01:30:49.485 --> 01:30:51.340
Archers, make way.

01:32:48.781 --> 01:32:49.926
Stand!

01:35:48.525 --> 01:35:49.605
Balam !

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.740
Not even you can heal this.

01:39:01.261 --> 01:39:03.365
Speak to your people, Balam.

01:39:19.565 --> 01:39:21.353
Hunac Kell is dead.

01:39:23.277 --> 01:39:25.611
The way to our homeland lies open.

01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:30.946
But now, l look upon what we have here.

01:39:32.525 --> 01:39:36.583
The grass grows,
the trees spread their branches,

01:39:36.653 --> 01:39:38.562
and the rivers flow.

01:39:39.244 --> 01:39:44.133
And we have not spilled one drop of blood
in sacrifice to the gods.

01:39:47.405 --> 01:39:51.660
Can it not be that the gods are satisfied

01:39:51.724 --> 01:39:56.067
with the sacrifices that each of us
must make in his day-to-day life,

01:39:57.165 --> 01:40:00.940
that the test of a people is in the living,
not the dying,

01:40:02.988 --> 01:40:08.324
and living in dignity
and decency and respect

01:40:08.397 --> 01:40:10.601
is all that the gods require?

01:40:16.269 --> 01:40:20.742
As for me, l remain here,

01:40:20.813 --> 01:40:24.109
but in Black Eagle's way,
l give you your choice.

01:40:25.836 --> 01:40:28.138
You may stay or you may go.

01:40:28.717 --> 01:40:30.789
But if you choose to stay,

01:40:32.941 --> 01:40:35.276
it will be without this.

01:41:00.493 --> 01:41:04.802
Balam, the jaguar, nine times king!

01:41:22.893 --> 01:41:27.170
You never taught me to write,
and l never taught you to hunt.

01:41:29.357 --> 01:41:33.415
And yet there are many things
we have learned from each other.

01:41:36.909 --> 01:41:39.877
Don't be a fool the rest of your life, Balam.

01:41:41.389 --> 01:41:45.699
lxchel is your woman.
She has always been.

01:41:48.877 --> 01:41:53.219
And now, more so than ever.
