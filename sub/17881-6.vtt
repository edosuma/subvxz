00:01.419 --> 00:04.365
Sometime's when you're working on an
important project with a hard deadline,

00:04.366 --> 00:08.782
you put in lot's of late nights. Are you sure you
don't want me to have the sitter pick you up honey?

00:08.783 --> 00:11.253
I'm sure she wouldn't mind eating
all my breakfast bars while you sleep,

00:12.833 --> 00:15.301
- and then hiding the wrappers from Mr. Ted.
- I want to stay here with you.

00:15.302 --> 00:17.871
Good. Good night.

00:23.944 --> 00:25.445
We did it, Ted.

00:25.446 --> 00:28.915
We now have a working prototype
for the Veridian sleep system.

00:28.916 --> 00:30.416
All the hard work,

00:30.417 --> 00:32.485
late nights and no rest have paid off.

00:32.485 --> 00:33.987
We've cured sleeplessness

00:33.988 --> 00:36.422
- and demonstrated irony.
- Well, that's great,

00:36.423 --> 00:38.791
because the relaxation
convention's only a week away.

00:38.792 --> 00:40.293
I know. It's so exciting.

00:40.294 --> 00:42.295
We heard a commercial
for it this morning.

00:42.296 --> 00:43.796
"Relaxxxacon!

00:43.797 --> 00:47.567
The world's largest gathering
of relaxation technology."

00:47.568 --> 00:49.535
"72 hours of nonstop,

00:49.536 --> 00:51.604
in-your-face,
cutting-edge relaxation."

00:51.605 --> 00:53.273
"Sammy hagar! Alice Cooper!

00:53.274 --> 00:56.376
And the navy's blue angels!"

00:56.377 --> 00:58.578
We're a little loopy

00:58.579 --> 01:01.614
due to the exhaustion.

01:01.615 --> 01:03.116
Behold.

01:03.117 --> 01:05.051
Inside this box is a transmitter

01:05.052 --> 01:07.120
which will induce the human brain

01:07.121 --> 01:08.554
to emit Alpha waves,

01:08.555 --> 01:11.791
gently lulling it into a restful sleep.

01:15.129 --> 01:17.363
That sounds means it's working.

01:17.364 --> 01:20.366
If you can put up with
it for three minutes,

01:20.367 --> 01:22.168
hello, dreamland!

01:22.169 --> 01:25.371
Turn it off! Just turn it off!

01:25.372 --> 01:26.806
I have a note.

01:26.807 --> 01:28.808
It's the sound, right?
That's what's bothering you?

01:28.809 --> 01:31.844
- It's too loud, correct?
- You've only got a few days to crack this, fellas.

01:31.845 --> 01:33.880
Otherwise, we are not
gonna make this year's.

01:33.881 --> 01:35.848
Relaxxxacon!

01:35.849 --> 01:39.752
The extra "x" is for more z's.

01:39.753 --> 01:41.988
Well, that is fun.

01:43.724 --> 01:46.326
Hey, Linda. One more
week. How you holding up?

01:46.327 --> 01:47.794
I'm a little tired,

01:47.795 --> 01:50.330
and working these hours
is making everyone unhappy.

01:50.331 --> 01:52.098
Bob stole Amy's danish.

01:52.099 --> 01:55.101
She got so mad, she stapled
his lip to his cubicle.

01:55.102 --> 01:58.204
He tried to call for help,
but it came out "helf."

01:59.340 --> 02:01.207
It was actually horrifying.

02:01.208 --> 02:04.344
They had to call an ambulance.

02:04.345 --> 02:06.713
Ugh! This is bitter.

02:06.714 --> 02:10.316
- Oh! God, you idiot!
- Oh, my God.

02:10.317 --> 02:12.885
Jenkins, I'm so tired, I
thought you were a sink.

02:12.886 --> 02:16.255
I'm so tired, I thought
you were my mouth.

02:16.256 --> 02:19.492
- Morale does seem pretty low.
- It's like that time

02:19.493 --> 02:21.561
they paid our holiday
bonuses in frozen food.

02:21.562 --> 02:23.096
Potpie Christmas.

02:23.097 --> 02:26.132
It did not help that they
made them with real reindeer.

02:26.133 --> 02:27.700
We have a morale problem.

02:27.701 --> 02:29.702
You're always coming
to me with a problem.

02:29.703 --> 02:32.472
Just once I wish you'd greet me
with a sparkler and cotton candy

02:32.473 --> 02:35.341
- and tell me I have the number one album America.
- You handed out

02:35.342 --> 02:38.344
"Veronica in the key of
love" at the office party,

02:38.345 --> 02:41.247
and no one threw it back at
you. Consider that a victory.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.282
Listen, this deadline is coming up fast,

02:43.283 --> 02:45.251
and if we want these
people to keep going,

02:45.252 --> 02:48.254
- we've gotta do something to keep th motivated.
- Ted, if there's a morale problem,

02:48.255 --> 02:49.555
the company recommends

02:49.556 --> 02:51.557
you take the hardest-working
employee and fire them.

02:51.558 --> 02:53.593
That'll scare the rest of the peasants

02:53.594 --> 02:55.928
- back into the fields.
- What if instead of scaring people,

02:55.929 --> 02:57.930
we single out the
hardest working employee

02:57.931 --> 03:00.299
and reward them with something fun?

03:00.300 --> 03:02.702
Less Stephen king, more
Stephen... the clown.

03:02.703 --> 03:04.637
I couldn'think of a fun Stephen.

03:04.638 --> 03:07.006
Segal. No, that one's no good either.

03:07.007 --> 03:09.876
Fine. The workers pushed the
button and lit up the light.

03:09.877 --> 03:11.844
They can have their monkey chow.

03:15.215 --> 03:18.651
Now you've all been working
really hard this week,

03:18.652 --> 03:20.620
but no one harder than Jenkins.

03:20.621 --> 03:22.622
He was here when I left last night,

03:22.623 --> 03:25.525
and he was already at his desk
when I got in this morning.

03:25.526 --> 03:27.860
If I had known Jenkins
was gonna be such a hero,

03:27.861 --> 03:30.897
- I wouldn't have thrown my coffee at him.
- You should never throw your coffee at anyone,

03:30.898 --> 03:32.999
because you never know
if they're going to become

03:33.000 --> 03:34.534
a great man.

03:34.535 --> 03:37.336
I threw coffee at a cardinal
on a plane. Now he's the pope.

03:37.337 --> 03:40.473
Back then he was just a guy in
a big hat blocking the movie.

03:40.474 --> 03:42.408
All right, guys.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.482 --> 03:58.783
Okay, I was wrong. It's
more than a morale problem.

03:58.784 --> 04:01.686
- We worked a man to death.
- I heard about Jenkins' death.

04:01.687 --> 04:03.655
The company feels terrible about it.

04:03.656 --> 04:06.457
People are working too hard,
Veronica. We need to slow down.

04:06.458 --> 04:07.892
Legal's position is,

04:07.893 --> 04:09.761
we don't know if hard
work killed Jenkins.

04:09.762 --> 04:12.497
Legal thinks he may have
had high cholesterol.

04:12.498 --> 04:14.465
They're also floating the
idea that his being dead

04:14.466 --> 04:16.401
may have been a preexisting condition,

04:16.402 --> 04:19.404
and that he may not have
been alive when we hired him.

04:19.404 --> 04:22.473
- Apparently he was pretty quiet in his job interview.
- Veronica, we need to get back to a normal work schedule,

04:22.474 --> 04:24.976
even if that means we don't
make the relaxxxacon deadline.

04:24.977 --> 04:27.779
We can introduce our sleep system
next month make at the snooze-a-palooza

04:27.780 --> 04:30.539
or in July at the Texas
pillow and gun show.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.785
Look, they're giving
everyone an afternoon off.

04:33.786 --> 04:35.787
And we're throwing
the guy a big memorial,

04:35.788 --> 04:38.456
something nice he would
never have treated himself to.

04:38.457 --> 04:41.192
- So that's it? A half a day off?
- Sorry, Ted. The company feels

04:41.193 --> 04:43.628
that if we ease up just
because someone died,

04:43.629 --> 04:46.364
- it will only encourage other people to die.
- Well, if it's one thing this company understands,

04:46.365 --> 04:48.533
it's how human beings work.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.465
You better not let Ted see
you looting Jenkins things.

04:55.466 --> 04:59.413
Ted asked me to clean up Jenkins'
desk, so we can ship it all to Florida.

05:00.069 --> 05:02.070
I think Jenkins has family there.

05:02.071 --> 05:04.072
Either that, or Florida has a shortage

05:04.073 --> 05:06.340
of miniature mouthwash
and dilbert cartoons.

05:08.043 --> 05:10.278
This cartoon resonates

05:10.279 --> 05:12.213
with my own experience of office life,

05:12.214 --> 05:14.148
but through a comical lens.

05:14.149 --> 05:16.551
God. You're here one
minute, and then... poof.

05:16.552 --> 05:18.619
You've exhaled your
last minty fresh breath

05:18.620 --> 05:21.422
and died in your office, cakess.

05:21.423 --> 05:22.924
That's why it's important

05:22.925 --> 05:24.826
to always appreciate
the moment you're in,

05:24.827 --> 05:28.029
because the future is a
cake which may never come.

05:28.030 --> 05:29.964
Wow. Look how profound
this moment just got.

05:29.965 --> 05:33.701
Let it wash over you,
Linda, because now it's gone.

05:33.702 --> 05:35.269
Did you appreciate it?

05:35.270 --> 05:38.039
I did, because I always
live in the present.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.308
Wow. This is a good moment, too.

05:40.309 --> 05:42.243
Savor it. I am.

05:42.244 --> 05:44.145
And now it's gone.

05:44.146 --> 05:47.248
I wish I could live
completely in the present.

05:47.249 --> 05:49.884
That's something about me
I've always wanted to work on.

05:49.885 --> 05:51.819
Maybe I'll attack it this summer.

05:51.820 --> 05:54.288
No, I was gonna do some
traveling, maybe go to europe.

05:54.289 --> 05:56.724
Also, I want to go up in a blimp...

05:56.725 --> 06:00.061
Ow! God! My eyes. What the hell?

06:00.062 --> 06:02.997
- I was helping you to live in this moment.
- It hurts!

06:02.998 --> 06:05.166
Exactly. You're in pain,

06:05.167 --> 06:07.101
and so you're completely in the present.

06:07.102 --> 06:09.737
And when you're in the present,
you're living your life.

06:09.738 --> 06:12.073
You're not caught up
in what could have been

06:12.074 --> 06:15.109
- or what might be.
- Huh. That makes sense.

06:15.110 --> 06:17.378
And so the student becomes the master.

06:17.379 --> 06:19.413
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:19.414 --> 06:21.382
Oh, I'm in this moment.

06:21.383 --> 06:23.718
Excellent. Now quick, look
at the dilbert cartoon.

06:23.719 --> 06:25.920
Oh. It's funny now.

06:25.921 --> 06:29.056
Because you're giving
it your complete focus.

06:29.057 --> 06:33.127
Now let's go listen to my
cd. It'll blow your mind.

06:33.128 --> 06:36.130
Since the company wasn't
gonna ease up on the schedule,

06:35.931 --> 06:38.399
I thought I'd use the
memorial to encourage everyone

06:38.400 --> 06:40.435
to take better care of themselves.

06:40.436 --> 06:42.370
You know what I remember about Jenkins?

06:42.371 --> 06:44.138
He used to be alive.

06:44.139 --> 06:46.341
So pace yourself, know your limits,
and if you feel yourself dying...

06:48.143 --> 06:49.777
Uh, well, tell your supervisor.

06:49.778 --> 06:51.746
I can't believe Ted's making
me speak at this thing.

06:51.747 --> 06:54.849
You knew Jenkins better than anybody.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.118
I didn't know him. Nobody did.

06:57.119 --> 07:00.088
- All I did was throw coffee at him.
- I am not saying things were always smooth

07:00.089 --> 07:01.723
between the two of you, but in
the end, you understood each other.

07:01.724 --> 07:04.592
Chest bump for good luck?

07:04.593 --> 07:08.830
Now I'd like to ask Lem
Hewitt to say a few words.

07:08.831 --> 07:11.466
These sugar cookies are great.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.668
I'm gonna have 'em at my memorial.

07:13.669 --> 07:15.303
I love sugar cookies.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.739
When I was a kid, my
mom used to make 'em.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.741
But instead of sugar, she'd use Brandy.

07:19.742 --> 07:22.176
And instead of dipping them in milk,

07:22.177 --> 07:24.212
she'd dip them in Brandy...
now what's going on?

07:24.213 --> 07:27.048
My mind was drifting, and I'm
trying to stay in the moment.

07:27.049 --> 07:29.984
Now I know what a beard
of fingers would feel like.

07:29.985 --> 07:32.286
It's just as I had imagined.

07:32.287 --> 07:34.288
Gordon Jenkins was a good man.

07:34.289 --> 07:36.157
But he was also a complex man.

07:36.158 --> 07:38.059
For example, he liked coffee,

07:38.060 --> 07:40.428
but he did not like having
coffee thrown at him.

07:40.429 --> 07:43.865
In fact, Jenkins hated being
burned by any hot liquid.

07:43.866 --> 07:46.401
In that way, he was like many of us,

07:46.402 --> 07:48.302
sensitive to heat.

07:48.303 --> 07:50.772
What a character. Goodbye, Jenkins.

07:50.773 --> 07:55.176
I hope you're throwing
coffee at God right now.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.281
Nice work, Lem. Goose bumps.

08:00.282 --> 08:02.283
- Really?
- Sure. Why not?

08:05.220 --> 08:06.721
Carl Jenkins...

08:06.722 --> 08:08.222
- Gordon.
- Carl Gordon...

08:08.223 --> 08:09.724
- Jenkins.
- Carl Gordon Jenkins...

08:09.725 --> 08:11.192
Gordon Jenkins.

08:11.193 --> 08:12.760
Carl Gordon Jenkins Gordon Jenkins.

08:12.761 --> 08:14.962
- Are you sure that's right?
- That's fine.

08:14.963 --> 08:16.998
Was a man who loved his work.

08:16.999 --> 08:18.332
He lived for it,

08:18.333 --> 08:20.401
and in all but the
legally culpable sense,

08:20.402 --> 08:22.003
he died for it.

08:22.004 --> 08:25.506
And so we must ask ourselves,
how do honor this great man?

08:25.507 --> 08:28.676
By giving up on the
project he held so dear?

08:30.646 --> 08:33.514
I said, by giving up on
the project he held so dear?

08:33.515 --> 08:36.951
- No.
- By quitting on him and his dream of creating

08:36.952 --> 08:39.886
the most advanced sleep
system in human history?

08:39.888 --> 08:41.422
No.

08:41.423 --> 08:42.890
Or by finishing the job

08:42.890 --> 08:44.826
Carl Gordon Jenkins
Gordon Jenkins started

08:44.827 --> 08:47.361
so that his death will not be in vain?

08:47.362 --> 08:50.965
Yes! By working day and
night to meet our deadline

08:50.966 --> 08:53.434
and storm the walls of relaxxxacon.

08:53.435 --> 08:57.071
- Yes!
- My friends, we will complete this project on time,

08:57.072 --> 08:59.974
and we will do it for Jenkins!

08:59.975 --> 09:02.376
- For Jenkins
- I can't hear you.

09:02.377 --> 09:04.879
- For Jenkins!
- Avenge him!

09:04.880 --> 09:06.347
Who do we kill?!

09:06.348 --> 09:08.816
Insomnia, and who do we kill it for?

09:08.817 --> 09:10.418
Jenkins!

09:10.419 --> 09:11.986
You're damn right.

09:11.987 --> 09:14.589
Now let's go upstairs
and get back to work,

09:14.590 --> 09:17.024
for tonight, we dine in hell!

09:26.001 --> 09:27.535
Sorry, Ted.

09:27.536 --> 09:30.705
The company didn't think
sad was the way to go.

09:32.927 --> 09:34.327
Veronica's speech at Jenkins' memorial

09:34.328 --> 09:36.296
inspired people to work even harder.

09:36.297 --> 09:39.299
The company liked what
it saw, so the next day,

09:39.300 --> 09:42.302
- it shifted the Jenkins mobile into turbo drive.
- So after day care,

09:42.303 --> 09:45.205
- do I get to sleep in your office again?
- Oh, look at you, saying "get to"

09:45.206 --> 09:47.074
to make me feel better.

09:47.075 --> 09:49.209
Honey, I know my being busy is hard,

09:49.210 --> 09:51.680
- but it's just for a few more days.
- It's okay. At least your couch is comfortable.

09:58.217 --> 09:59.385
So we're doing posters now?

09:59.387 --> 10:00.654
The company got us these

10:00.655 --> 10:02.522
to remind us what we're working for.

10:02.523 --> 10:03.890
Plus, they got us

10:03.891 --> 10:06.092
these neat little rubber
wristbands for free.

10:06.093 --> 10:09.095
- It says, "work strong. For Jenkins." Here.
- Sheila, don't you see what's happening?

10:09.096 --> 10:10.931
The company is exploiting Jenkins' death

10:10.932 --> 10:13.600
- to make people work harder.
- The company said that Jenkins said

10:13.601 --> 10:15.368
that some people would say that.

10:15.369 --> 10:18.371
I just can't believe
it's one of the finders.

10:18.372 --> 10:19.839
The finders?

10:20.140 --> 10:22.876
One of the eight people
who found his body.

10:29.183 --> 10:31.251
Lem! Wake up!

10:31.252 --> 10:34.220
The cool accountants
are on their way down.

10:34.221 --> 10:37.023
- Oh, damn it. And the lab is such a mess.
- Wh... Perry and Todd and beaver?

10:37.024 --> 10:39.425
What are those guys
doing coming down here?

10:39.426 --> 10:42.495
Stop questioning me and
help clean this place up.

10:42.496 --> 10:43.630
Hey.

10:43.631 --> 10:45.532
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:45.533 --> 10:48.334
- Clean lab, bro.
- Yeah, whatever.

10:48.335 --> 10:51.137
So you were friends with Jenkins, huh?

10:51.258 --> 10:52.759
Me?

10:52.760 --> 10:55.294
Uh, yeah, yeah. We
were pretty tight. Sure.

10:55.295 --> 10:58.531
That's sick. What was he really like?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.001
He had a huge heart.

11:02.002 --> 11:03.970
Uh, I remember him saying once,

11:03.971 --> 11:06.906
"Lem, you are my best
friend, and if I should die,

11:06.907 --> 11:09.742
at least I'll die knowing
one really cool guy.

11:09.743 --> 11:13.279
You, Lem, the cool
guy I'm referring to."

11:13.280 --> 11:15.481
Nice.

11:15.482 --> 11:18.017
Dude, we're gonna step outside
to take a cigarette break.

11:18.018 --> 11:20.420
- Do you want to come?
- Well, I don't smoke,

11:20.421 --> 11:22.955
- but I'd love to watch you guys smoke.
- Me, too.

11:22.956 --> 11:24.390
Then it's settled.

11:24.391 --> 11:27.527
- We all get to...
hang out with you guys.

11:27.528 --> 11:28.828
Oh, sorry, odd lab dude.

11:28.829 --> 11:30.930
The smoking area's kinda small.

11:30.931 --> 11:34.100
Well, isn't it all of the outdoors?

11:34.101 --> 11:37.270
For the love of God, Phil,
please don't ruin this for me.

11:40.207 --> 11:42.642
Oh, Linda, I need your testing report

11:42.643 --> 11:44.777
on the sleep system packaging.

11:44.778 --> 11:47.647
Marketing keeps... I'm
going to count to one.

11:47.648 --> 11:50.383
Sorry. It helps me stay in the moment.

11:50.384 --> 11:52.351
If your moments don't
hold your attention,

11:52.352 --> 11:53.820
you need to look deeper

11:53.821 --> 11:56.122
until you find what's
interesting in them.

11:56.123 --> 11:58.291
Like right now, I'm losing
interest in this moment.

11:58.292 --> 12:00.493
And so I'm going to...

12:00.494 --> 12:01.861
Sweep the leg.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.129
Oh!

12:03.130 --> 12:07.266
That's what this moment needed.

12:07.267 --> 12:09.268
Now the company's exploiting Jenkins

12:09.269 --> 12:11.337
to get people to work harder.

12:11.338 --> 12:14.307
There's posters and bracelets.
There's an inspirational video

12:14.308 --> 12:17.810
- about him playing in the elevator.
- I know. I got them to use one of the songs from

12:17.811 --> 12:19.645
"Veronica in the key of love."

12:24.418 --> 12:27.086
The settlers crossing the prairie...

12:27.087 --> 12:30.823
Jonas Salk discovering
the polio vaccine...

12:30.824 --> 12:33.526
Gordon Jenkins writing
the table of contents

12:33.527 --> 12:35.895
for the Veridian sleep system manual...

12:35.896 --> 12:38.297
Great achievements take hard work.

12:38.298 --> 12:41.701
Shouldn't you try to be
more like Gordon Jenkins?

12:41.702 --> 12:44.237
Yes, you should.

12:45.873 --> 12:48.074
Don't get me wrong. It
was the best elevator video

12:48.075 --> 12:50.076
since the soft-core
porn one about recycling.

12:50.077 --> 12:52.645
But if the company keeps
using Jenkins to rev people up,

12:52.646 --> 12:54.814
someone else is gonna get hurt or dead.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.383
It's just for a few more
days until relaxxxacon,

12:57.384 --> 12:59.650
and then the Jenkins thing will end.

12:59.651 --> 13:02.309
Yeah? Because knowing how much
this company loves productivity,

13:02.310 --> 13:04.707
it wouldn't surprise me if
14-hour days became the new normal.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.020
- The Jenkins thing will end.
- And so will the 14-hour days.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.290
- The Jenkins thing will end.
- Veronica, the 14-hour days?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.191
Jenkins, goodbye. Adios, Jenkins.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.727
- Jenkins no mo'.
- You gotta be kidding me.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.829
So they really are gonna
make this permanent?

13:17.830 --> 13:20.065
None of us are gonna
see oufamilies again.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.567
AnI like Rose.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.268
I wasn't entirely sold
in the first six months,

13:23.269 --> 13:24.836
but now I'm way into her.

13:24.727 --> 13:27.262
I'm gonna go tell everyone
in this department, Veronica,

13:27.263 --> 13:30.666
-and they are not gonna stand for it.
- Oh, Ted, you adorable little flower.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.701
What are they gonna do, quit?

13:32.702 --> 13:35.137
If they do, the company
will just replace them.

13:35.138 --> 13:35.806
Then I am gonna go upstairs
and convince management

13:35.807 --> 13:37.415
that what they're doing is immoral.

13:39.943 --> 13:43.011
Wow. I'm glad I tried that one
out on you before going up there.

13:43.012 --> 13:45.981
Ted, no one knows how
many licks it takes

13:45.982 --> 13:48.350
to get to my moral center, but I can see

13:48.351 --> 13:51.253
how this is important to
you, so here's the deal...

13:51.254 --> 13:54.022
if you want to get the company
off this, you have to show them

13:54.023 --> 13:55.924
that this new pace is
gonna cost them money,

13:55.925 --> 13:57.860
because the company loves its money.

13:57.861 --> 13:59.828
If they could, they'd go to strip clubs

13:59.829 --> 14:02.564
and throw naked women at money.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.766
So Jenkins hooks this 6-foot trout,

14:04.767 --> 14:07.102
and it's freaking out,
flopping around the boat.

14:07.103 --> 14:09.071
And Jenkins hated the sight of blood

14:09.072 --> 14:11.106
because of his time in the Mossad.

14:11.107 --> 14:14.076
So I had to reach past
those razor-sharp teeth

14:14.077 --> 14:16.011
and pull the hook out for him.

14:16.012 --> 14:18.514
We hugged and wept,

14:18.515 --> 14:20.115
and Jenkins said to me,

14:20.116 --> 14:24.453
"Lem, you... are my best friend."

14:24.454 --> 14:25.721
Lem.

14:25.722 --> 14:28.290
Can I talk to you for a minute?

14:28.291 --> 14:30.392
Oh, sure.

14:33.263 --> 14:36.265
That was our fishing story,
except it was you who was

14:36.266 --> 14:38.567
flopping around on the floor
with a hook in your mouth,

14:38.568 --> 14:41.003
and I was thone who took it
out, and there was no fish

14:41.004 --> 14:43.739
because the whole thing happened
at a sporting goods store.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.708
- And it is my wife who was in Mossad.
- Phil, the cool accountants like me.

14:46.509 --> 14:49.011
They let me go to the store
and buy them cigarettes.

14:49.012 --> 14:51.747
And I need more Jenkins stories than that coffee
spilling one that just lies there like a turd.

14:51.748 --> 14:54.516
I feel like Jenkins is replacing me.

14:54.517 --> 14:56.352
That's ridiculous.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.788
Why don't we have lunch
later, just you and me?

14:59.789 --> 15:02.157
It's basted chicken
day in the cafeteria.

15:02.158 --> 15:05.260
It'll give us another chance
to figure out what broasting is.

15:05.261 --> 15:08.097
Well, I do want to get
to the bottom of that.

15:08.098 --> 15:09.998
Okay, we'll have lunch.

15:09.999 --> 15:11.834
I just hope "broasting" is not a typo,

15:11.835 --> 15:14.436
like that butter crotch pudding.

15:14.437 --> 15:16.839
So I've been trying
to live in the moment,

15:16.840 --> 15:18.340
but it's really hard

15:18.341 --> 15:20.743
because a lot of my moments
aren't that interesting.

15:20.744 --> 15:23.067
So I was wondering... do you
want to have sex right now?

15:23.068 --> 15:24.768
Gee, that feels really right,

15:24.414 --> 15:26.215
but I'm in the middle of something.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.717
In fact, you can help me.

15:28.718 --> 15:30.919
I need to sabotage the sleep system
and make sure it's not finished

15:30.920 --> 15:33.589
- in time for relaxxxacon.
- Cool. That's not sex but it beats

15:33.590 --> 15:36.058
getting knocked to the
floor so hard, you want to go

15:36.059 --> 15:38.727
- back to Wisconsin and get your master's in cheese sciences.
- Yes, it does.

15:38.728 --> 15:41.630
See, I need to show the
company that overworking people

15:41.631 --> 15:43.599
will make them so tired,
they'll make mistakes,

15:43.600 --> 15:46.502
- and that will cost the company money.
- Yeah. This could be a great moment.

15:46.503 --> 15:49.271
We'll go to the basement
and get a fire hose.

15:49.272 --> 15:52.741
- Then we get ten pies, a ramp and a motorcycle...
- All I need is your computer.

15:52.742 --> 15:54.977
See, you have access to
the shipping database.

15:54.978 --> 15:57.045
And I need to cancel an order of parts

15:57.046 --> 15:59.982
- for the sleep system prototype.
- And you want to use my computer

15:59.983 --> 16:02.184
so you don't get in
trouble. Nice try, crisp.

16:02.185 --> 16:04.486
Sweep the leg.

16:06.890 --> 16:08.991
Look, you're not gonna get in trouble.

16:08.992 --> 16:10.826
It'll just look like an anonymous worker

16:10.827 --> 16:13.362
- making a sleepy mistake.
- Fine.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.701
Lem, I talked to the chef, it turns
out that broasting is a combination of,

16:19.702 --> 16:21.136
and I'm quoting,

16:21.137 --> 16:23.272
"roasting and get the
hell out of my kitchen."

16:23.273 --> 16:25.140
He wouldn't tell me the proportions.

16:25.141 --> 16:28.343
Who's in the urn?

16:28.344 --> 16:30.779
It's him, isn't it?

16:30.780 --> 16:32.748
Jenkins doesn't have
any family out here,

16:32.749 --> 16:35.551
so the company asked
me to pick up his ashes.

16:35.552 --> 16:38.387
I see. Well, you two enjoy your lunch.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.855
Oh. Come on, Phil.

16:39.856 --> 16:42.191
What was I supposed to
do, leave him in a car?

16:42.192 --> 16:44.927
- It's a hot day.
- He's already ashes.

16:44.928 --> 16:46.895
Look, I know you don't like him,

16:46.896 --> 16:49.231
but he is my friend now.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.800
So why don't you come join us for lunch?

16:51.801 --> 16:54.770
I'm sure the three of
us can work this out.

16:54.771 --> 16:56.672
Or... why don't I do this?!

17:13.957 --> 17:16.090
You two are jerks.

17:16.092 --> 17:18.393
?
Shaba-daba-Dee-do-da ?

17:18.394 --> 17:19.862
?
Shaba-daba-boo-be-ba... ?

17:19.863 --> 17:21.864
It is 8:00 at night,
and the shipment of parts

17:21.865 --> 17:23.799
for the sleep system never got here.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.800
Now we are not gonna make our deadline,

17:25.801 --> 17:27.269
and the company will learn

17:27.270 --> 17:29.304
that pushing people too
hard leads to mistakes.

17:29.305 --> 17:31.206
How do I feel about that?

17:31.207 --> 17:32.741
* Never gonna let you down *

17:32.742 --> 17:36.712
* Never gonna run
around and desert you *

17:36.713 --> 17:39.948
* Shaba-daba-Dee-do-da
shaba-daba-boo-be-ba... ?

17:39.949 --> 17:42.918
Ted, the parts shipment for
the prototype didn't arrive.

17:42.919 --> 17:44.987
We'll never be ready
in time for relaxxxacon.

17:44.988 --> 17:46.922
Where's your Jenkins now?

17:46.923 --> 17:49.358
The parts didn't come? Oh,
my God. This is terrible.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.493
What are we gonna do, go
home to our families? Okay.

17:51.494 --> 17:55.063
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

17:55.064 --> 17:56.494
We are all disappointed we're
not gonna make the deadline.

17:56.495 --> 17:58.495
Now Jenkins' soul is going to hell!

17:58.701 --> 18:01.003
Aw. No, it's not, Sheila.

18:01.004 --> 18:03.238
That's just something the elevator said.

18:03.239 --> 18:05.507
Look, when we push ourselves
too hard, mistakes get made.

18:05.508 --> 18:07.576
And now there's no possible way...

18:07.577 --> 18:09.745
- I've got the parts for the prototype!
- What? That's impossible.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.780
The parts didn't come
because someone was tired

18:11.781 --> 18:14.349
- so now the company can't work us so hard.
- Actually, last night, I was so sleepy,

18:14.350 --> 18:16.618
I accidentally opened
the shipping database,

18:16.619 --> 18:18.720
and I saw that someone
had canceled the order.

18:18.721 --> 18:20.722
So I stole my ex-wife's minivan,
drove all night to Stockton

18:20.523 --> 18:22.324
got the order and brought it back.

18:22.325 --> 18:24.159
I've been driving for 20 straight hours.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.028
I took everything the truckers gave me.

18:26.029 --> 18:29.198
- Watch how fast I can run.
- Now we can go back to work. For Jenkins!

18:29.199 --> 18:31.166
- For Jenkins!
- No, wait, wait, look.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.136
The company is using Jenkins
to get you all to work harder.

18:34.137 --> 18:36.405
But the thing is, it's...

18:36.406 --> 18:38.307
it's not gonna be just for this project.

18:38.308 --> 18:41.910
The company wants to make these
crazy hours the new normal.

18:41.911 --> 18:43.979
But we can't work this way forever.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.648
No, we can't. So I'm going
back to my old schedule.

18:46.649 --> 18:48.684
I don't care what they do to me.

18:48.685 --> 18:50.586
I'm taking my daughter
and I'm going home.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.021
So we weren't working
this hard for Jenkins?

18:53.022 --> 18:55.124
We were doing it all for the company?

18:55.125 --> 18:57.760
But Jenkins was still
a great man, right?

18:57.761 --> 18:59.895
I mean, you were with him when
he helped that killer whale

18:59.896 --> 19:03.065
- find its way home.
- I had not heard that one.

19:03.066 --> 19:05.100
Was that an embellishment
of the time I helped

19:05.101 --> 19:07.870
that large woman with the
hole in the top of her head

19:07.871 --> 19:09.805
find her way back to her apartment?

19:09.806 --> 19:12.274
Actually, I stole that
story from "Free Willy."

19:12.275 --> 19:14.610
I've been using Jenkins for my own gain,

19:14.611 --> 19:16.111
just like the company.

19:16.112 --> 19:18.347
All those stories I told about Jenkins

19:18.348 --> 19:20.449
were really just things I did with Phil.

19:20.450 --> 19:24.720
Phil is the great man and
Phil is my best friend.

19:24.721 --> 19:26.355
Who's Phil?

19:30.860 --> 19:32.327
Where are you going?

19:32.328 --> 19:34.329
I've had it. I'm going home.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.265
But it's still dark out.

19:49.044 --> 19:50.145
I have to pee.

19:50.146 --> 19:53.215
Uh, can it wait, honey? We're
kinda having a moment here.

19:53.216 --> 19:55.016
Nope. Sorry.

20:15.371 --> 20:18.006
Hey.

20:22.411 --> 20:24.446
Hold the door!

20:26.616 --> 20:28.950
- I'm going with you.
- You're supporting me on this?

20:28.951 --> 20:31.419
What? Oh, no. I just have a dinner date.

20:36.464 --> 20:38.632
Well, all my stuff's still here.

20:38.666 --> 20:41.901
And they didn't spring the
trap door on me in the lobby.

20:41.936 --> 20:45.005
- So I guess I haven't been fired.
- Nope. We won.

20:45.039 --> 20:47.073
Apparently after we
stormed out last night,

20:47.108 --> 20:49.509
the whole department
filed out behind us.

20:49.543 --> 20:52.445
So the company backed
down on the new hours?

20:52.480 --> 20:54.514
I... we did it,

20:54.548 --> 20:57.317
because I/we stood
up for what was right.

20:57.351 --> 20:59.819
I/we am proud of me/us.

20:59.854 --> 21:01.488
I/me, too, Ted.

21:01.522 --> 21:04.457
Together, we're like Gandhi.

21:04.492 --> 21:07.196
I'm skinny, and you're tan.
