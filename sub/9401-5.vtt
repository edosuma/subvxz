WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:02.501
What's a love child?

00:02.901 --> 00:04.734
Did I not ask you to look

00:04.801 --> 00:06.367
into the Nathan Scott situation
to find out if there was a story?

00:06.433 --> 00:08.801
Right now, it's nothing but a
rumor in some low-rent tabloid.

00:08.867 --> 00:11.300
That's not fair,
and it's not what I do.

00:11.367 --> 00:12.734
Yeah, just keep walking, McFadden.

00:12.801 --> 00:14.500
You're off the air!

00:14.567 --> 00:15.767
Where is Makenna?

00:15.834 --> 00:17.333
Millie can handle it.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.534
She can take Makenna's place.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.001
There's an after after party

00:21.067 --> 00:22.534
that nobody's invited to except us.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.667
You're going.

00:25.001 --> 00:26.567
Say "yes."

00:26.634 --> 00:28.667
Yes.
Yes!

00:28.734 --> 00:31.101
I wouldn't mind meeting with
the writer. I got a few ideas.

00:31.168 --> 00:32.534
I wrote it.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.168
If you're serious about this,
I'd be willing

00:34.234 --> 00:36.734
to work with you on it,
but only if you're committed.

00:36.801 --> 00:38.967
I would love to commit to you, Julian.

00:39.034 --> 00:40.400
I'm sorry, David.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.567
I think we should get a divorce.

00:42.634 --> 00:44.367
Where to?

00:44.433 --> 00:45.700
Your place.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.067
Just drive.

00:48.134 --> 00:50.433
What are you doing here?
He doesn't love you.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.667
You don't know what you're
talking about, sweetie.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.433
He told me while we were making love.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:06.900 --> 01:08.568
Maybe I am a slut,

01:08.634 --> 01:10.668
but that's what Nathan liked about me.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.833
He had me do all kinds of things to him

01:12.900 --> 01:14.601
that he said you would never...

01:14.668 --> 01:15.900
that's the only hit to come

01:15.967 --> 01:17.467
out of rock star Haley james Scott

01:17.534 --> 01:18.934
in five years.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.167
Let's see that again!

01:21.234 --> 01:23.700
He had me do all kinds of things to
him that he said you would never...

01:25.934 --> 01:27.634
Well, I suppose there's worse things

01:27.700 --> 01:29.134
than hitting a pregnant woman.

01:29.201 --> 01:30.800
Yeah? Like what?

01:30.867 --> 01:31.934
Let's see that again!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.867
Just give me a second.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.267
...that he said you would never.

01:35.334 --> 01:36.568
Mm.

01:36.634 --> 01:38.401
Good slap, though.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.934
Thank God Jamie and Quinn
aren't awake to see this.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.634
It's okay.

01:46.967 --> 01:49.601
It's a long walk of shame
from here to Nate's.

01:49.668 --> 01:51.867
You might want to eat something first.

01:51.934 --> 01:53.900
Yeah, I was just gonna
grab a cab of shame,

01:53.967 --> 01:55.267
so, I'm good, but thank you.

01:55.334 --> 01:56.568
You know, I can drive you.

01:56.668 --> 01:58.767
You know, it's cheaper
than a cab of shame

01:58.833 --> 02:00.267
and comes with a free meal.

02:00.334 --> 02:03.434
It's more the driver that
I'm worried about, so...

02:03.501 --> 02:05.234
Did I mention I made breakfast burritos?

02:07.434 --> 02:08.733
I do like breakfast burritos.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.934
Mm-hmm.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.900
I make a mean breakfast burrito.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.568
Have you seen Alex's script?
I'm working with her today.

02:19.334 --> 02:20.634
Ohh. Sorry.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.100
Good morning, Brooke Davis.

02:22.167 --> 02:24.867
You get sexier and younger every day.

02:24.934 --> 02:27.867
Well, good morning, babe.
You're so sweet.

02:31.201 --> 02:32.700
So, have you seen her script?

02:32.767 --> 02:35.967
You certainly do know
how to hit the off switch.

02:36.034 --> 02:38.434
Sorry, babe, but you know
I'm working with her today.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.467
Yeah. I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

02:40.534 --> 02:41.967
I don't trust her around men.

02:42.034 --> 02:44.034
She's like one of those
herpes from mythology.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.800
You mean "harpies"?

02:45.867 --> 02:47.668
No, actually, I don't.

02:47.733 --> 02:49.467
Her underwear should be a welcome mat,

02:49.534 --> 02:51.234
and I've seen the way she looks at you.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.733
Can't you find a better script,
written by an uglier person?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.733
Trust me,
I'm not interested in the writer.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.134
I'm interested in the story.

02:57.201 --> 02:59.334
As long as it doesn't become the story

02:59.401 --> 03:01.301
you and Alex tell your kids someday

03:01.367 --> 03:02.733
when they ask how you met.

03:07.334 --> 03:09.601
Hey.

03:09.668 --> 03:13.100
The only kids I'll be
telling stories to...

03:13.167 --> 03:14.668
will be ours.

03:16.568 --> 03:19.067
That's a good answer.

03:29.934 --> 03:33.134
Have a good day.

03:43.601 --> 03:44.934
Have a good night?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.601
Marvin. You scared me.

03:47.668 --> 03:49.867
Well, then, I guess we're even,
then. Where have you been?

03:49.934 --> 03:51.234
It was such a crazy night.

03:51.301 --> 03:52.601
One of the models passed out,

03:52.668 --> 03:54.301
so Brooke let me go up in her place.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.568
You modeled?

03:55.634 --> 03:57.100
Yeah. Can you believe it?

03:57.167 --> 03:58.767
And then Alex wanted to celebrate,

03:58.833 --> 04:00.134
so we went out for a few drinks,

04:00.201 --> 04:01.800
and I guess I just lost track of time.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.267
Weren't you tipped off
when the sun came up?

04:04.334 --> 04:06.134
You never even called.

04:06.201 --> 04:07.401
I know, and I'm really sorry,

04:07.467 --> 04:08.967
but can we talk about it at lunch?

04:09.034 --> 04:10.234
I'm late for work.

04:10.301 --> 04:12.967
I really am sorry.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.567
I'm not seeing the licorice whips.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.434
Oh, I must have forgotten to order more.

04:22.501 --> 04:25.668
I... I'm sorry, Mr. Scott.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.501
Hey. I forgive you.

04:37.501 --> 04:41.267
"Nathan Scott: a basketball
star's love child."

04:41.334 --> 04:44.334
Like father, like son, huh?

04:53.467 --> 04:55.301
So, I guess, since
you're playing video games,

04:55.367 --> 04:56.833
you've already brushed your teeth, huh?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.067
You know it.

04:58.134 --> 04:59.467
If you're lying,

04:59.534 --> 05:01.800
the tooth police will come
and take your teeth away.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.434
That's right,
and then everyone's

05:03.501 --> 05:04.767
gonna call you "gummy Scott."

05:04.833 --> 05:06.668
Right.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.134
I'll get it.

05:16.367 --> 05:18.800
I'll brush! I'll brush!

05:18.867 --> 05:21.034
Haley Scott?

05:21.100 --> 05:22.733
You're under arrest for
assault and battery.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.367
Please turn around.
Excuse me?!

05:24.434 --> 05:25.434
Put your hands behind your back.

05:25.501 --> 05:27.000
You're not arresting my wife.

05:27.067 --> 05:28.568
You need to step away, sir.

05:28.634 --> 05:29.767
Are you serious?

05:29.833 --> 05:30.967
...in the court of law.

05:31.034 --> 05:32.467
You have the right to an attorney.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.234
Oh, you guys are real heroes,
aren't you?

05:37.201 --> 05:37.967
Mom!

05:37.934 --> 05:39.634
It's okay, baby. Go inside.
I'll be home later.

05:39.701 --> 05:41.733
Haley, we're right behind you.
Okay? Don't worry.

05:59.201 --> 06:01.700
I bet you charge a lot for
that innocent-mommy look, huh?

06:02.767 --> 06:03.234
What?

06:03.301 --> 06:04.501
Hey, I know you.

06:04.567 --> 06:07.301
My husband showed me your clip
on the internet last night,

06:07.068 --> 06:08.834
then he got an I.M.
from some dirty skank,

06:08.901 --> 06:10.834
so I smashed him over the
head with a keyboard.

06:10.901 --> 06:13.534
She was on the internet?
What did she do?

06:13.601 --> 06:16.167
Bitch-slapped some pregnant chick.

06:17.634 --> 06:19.400
That is cold.

06:29.001 --> 06:31.534
You know, this has been quite
the bonus for spending the night.

06:31.601 --> 06:33.267
So, what kind of feast would you make me

06:33.334 --> 06:34.467
if I spent the whole weekend?

06:35.667 --> 06:37.133
Probably something to go.

06:38.701 --> 06:40.934
So, did you learn to cook
just to impress women?

06:42.100 --> 06:44.567
Something like that.

06:46.267 --> 06:48.001
Does your phone ever stop buzzing?

06:48.068 --> 06:50.734
Because I only have one thing
that vibrates that much.

06:51.968 --> 06:53.467
They're all business calls.

06:53.534 --> 06:55.801
Oh, really? Okay.
All business calls. Let's see.

06:55.867 --> 06:59.233
Hmm. Katie, Alex, Faith.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.767
Ooh, Melissa, Kylie.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.267
So, you're a pimp?

07:02.334 --> 07:03.434
Mm.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.701
Let's see who your last five calls are.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.367
David, David...

07:09.434 --> 07:12.233
David, David.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.400
David.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.068
Sorry.

07:17.534 --> 07:19.334
Make you a deal.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.867
I'll turn off mine if
you turn off yours.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.034
Deal.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.601
This is Clay.
Leave a message.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.500
Clay, where the hell are you?
Haley's been arrested!

07:33.567 --> 07:35.567
Call me back!

07:37.634 --> 07:38.934
Aunt Quinn isn't in her room,

07:39.001 --> 07:41.167
and she made her bed
just like mom makes it.

07:41.233 --> 07:43.434
It doesn't even look
like she slept in there.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.901
So, after you read me the numbers,

07:49.968 --> 07:51.367
I write them down in this book.

07:51.434 --> 07:52.801
Got it?

07:52.867 --> 07:54.968
Actually, I came up with
the whole logging system

07:55.034 --> 07:56.467
when I first started.

07:56.534 --> 07:59.100
They, uh, they used to
call it the Marvin method.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.367
We call it logging tapes.

08:01.434 --> 08:05.068
So, did, uh,
Harvey explain the job to you?

08:05.133 --> 08:08.233
I believe he came up with
the logging method himself.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.267
Now, of course, you could
be a real reporter again

08:11.334 --> 08:13.667
if you just read the
stories we give you.

08:13.734 --> 08:16.834
I am a real reporter. That's
why I don't report gossip.

08:16.901 --> 08:18.500
Fine.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.701
Well, just keep logging it instead.

08:28.767 --> 08:31.001
I'm so sorry I'm late!
Please don't kill me!

08:32.734 --> 08:34.634
Okay!
Please don't have sex with me, either.

08:34.701 --> 08:35.767
You are not gonna believe this!

08:35.833 --> 08:38.900
You were a huge hit last night!

08:38.967 --> 08:40.200
Huge!

08:41.833 --> 08:43.001
They think I look ordinary.

08:43.068 --> 08:45.734
No, they think you're amazing...

08:45.801 --> 08:48.068
"beautiful, sexy,
smokin' hot."

08:48.133 --> 08:50.601
This person thinks I
look like a turd sandwich!

08:50.667 --> 08:52.300
Okay. You can't focus
on one negative comment.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.400
This person agrees!
Well, then, listen to me!

08:54.467 --> 08:56.233
I think you're gorgeous!

08:56.300 --> 08:58.034
You don't think I look like

08:58.100 --> 08:59.334
"a frumpy whore on bingo night"?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.634
No!

09:00.701 --> 09:03.300
If I did,
would I ask you to model full time?

09:04.901 --> 09:07.133
We want to do a whole line
based on "zero is not a size."

09:07.200 --> 09:08.534
I mentioned the idea to Victoria,

09:08.601 --> 09:09.801
and she jumped on it so fast,

09:09.867 --> 09:11.200
you'd think it was Julian's dad.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.233
I'm not a model.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.133
But you were last night.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.001
Did you like it or not?

09:17.068 --> 09:18.901
Yeah, I did.
Well, there you go.

09:18.968 --> 09:20.400
Alex isn't a model, either,

09:20.467 --> 09:22.500
and that's not stopping her
from taking my money.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.167
Yeah, but Alex is a lot sexier than me.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.534
Hi, Julian!

09:28.601 --> 09:30.467
You ready to give me notes?

09:30.534 --> 09:32.567
Yes. Here's my first one...
get dressed.

09:32.634 --> 09:34.868
Oh.
I'm sorry.

09:34.933 --> 09:36.967
I just got caught up
watching "Grease 2."

09:37.033 --> 09:38.434
Does that ever happen to you?

09:38.501 --> 09:40.467
Yes.

09:40.534 --> 09:43.334
Come on in.
I'll be ready in a sec.

09:47.434 --> 09:51.100
Ohh.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.100
I thought you were getting dressed!

09:53.167 --> 09:55.534
I did. See?

09:55.601 --> 09:56.967
No.

09:57.033 --> 09:58.334
At least it's not a welcome mat.

09:58.401 --> 09:59.967
I wore them when I auditioned
for "Wonder woman,"

10:00.033 --> 10:01.567
but I didn't get the part.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.033
Does that mean they're bad luck?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.134
Maybe I should take them off.
No, no, no, no!

10:05.200 --> 10:06.267
No.

10:06.334 --> 10:07.868
I can't believe I'm saying this,

10:07.933 --> 10:09.768
but you need to put more clothes on.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.567
Why? It's not like they're
crotchless or edible.

10:12.634 --> 10:14.634
Because if I work with you in yours,

10:14.701 --> 10:16.768
I'll never see Brooke in hers again.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.567
Oh, my God. You're so cute.

10:19.634 --> 10:20.801
I just want to hug you.

10:20.868 --> 10:21.933
Yeah, don't!

10:22.000 --> 10:24.434
Uh, maybe we should do this another day.

10:24.501 --> 10:26.634
Maybe somewhere public.

10:26.701 --> 10:29.601
I am really,
really excited to start.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.234
All set.

10:36.834 --> 10:37.900
You're walking me to the door.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.367
I didn't know you were such a gentleman.

10:39.434 --> 10:40.601
I'm an enigma.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.367
You just want to talk to Nathan.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.434
Mystery solved.

10:44.501 --> 10:45.900
Did you get my messages?

10:45.967 --> 10:47.200
We turned our phones off.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.167
Oh, we did, did we?

10:49.234 --> 10:50.200
What's up?

10:50.267 --> 10:51.734
Haley's in jail.

10:51.801 --> 10:54.134
Quinn, watch Jamie.

11:06.801 --> 11:08.967
What are you doing here?

11:09.033 --> 11:10.567
You've spent enough time at my studio.

11:10.634 --> 11:11.933
I figured I should return the favor.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.701
How are lessons going?

11:15.768 --> 11:18.234
There's nothing like it, Mia...

11:18.300 --> 11:19.801
flying through the air.

11:19.868 --> 11:21.868
I would stay up there forever
if it wasn't for you...

11:23.200 --> 11:25.334
...and gas.

11:25.401 --> 11:27.067
Good to know.
I come before gas.

11:27.134 --> 11:28.634
Most of the time, you do.

11:28.701 --> 11:30.634
Chase, you're up!

11:30.701 --> 11:33.467
Looks like we're gonna head back up.

11:33.534 --> 11:34.501
You want to come?

11:34.567 --> 11:36.401
No, thanks.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.300
Musicians and small planes don't mix.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.434
Right.

11:43.768 --> 11:46.434
Then I'll learn to fly a big plane.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.267
I would have slapped that bitch, too.

11:54.334 --> 11:56.000
And your cheating husband.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.768
He didn't cheat.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.067
Really?

11:59.134 --> 12:01.234
He is good-looking, famous...

12:01.300 --> 12:02.868
and is surrounded by girls.

12:04.634 --> 12:07.768
My husband's a fat, lazy bum,
and he cheats all the time.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.900
It's just what men do.

12:09.967 --> 12:11.900
Well, not Nathan.

12:11.967 --> 12:14.334
Oh, well, aren't you lucky?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.267
You must have found the only one.

12:17.701 --> 12:19.367
Well, if he's so great...

12:19.434 --> 12:21.267
then why are you still in here?

12:22.868 --> 12:24.367
Haley James Scott?

12:24.434 --> 12:27.267
There he is now.

12:50.034 --> 12:51.267
What the hell do you want?

12:51.968 --> 12:54.100
I'm dropping the charges.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.034
I shouldn't have
provoked you last night.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.901
You're not the one that I'm angry with.

12:57.968 --> 13:00.001
Well, that's great.
Thank you.

13:00.068 --> 13:02.100
Let's do each other's hair now.

13:02.167 --> 13:04.601
Look, I know that you think
that I'm lying, but I'm not.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.867
Nathan is, to the both of us.

13:06.934 --> 13:08.267
This is such crap.

13:08.334 --> 13:10.467
I know him better than
anybody else in the world,

13:10.534 --> 13:12.434
and what you're saying he did isn't him!

13:14.267 --> 13:16.367
Maybe not when he's sober.

13:16.434 --> 13:17.801
But he wasn't.

13:17.867 --> 13:19.200
Neither of us were.

13:26.068 --> 13:28.100
What? What is this?

13:28.167 --> 13:30.701
The number of men who might
be the father of your baby?

13:31.834 --> 13:33.834
It's my phone number.

13:33.901 --> 13:36.500
Look through Nathan's
old cellphone bills.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.601
I'm sorry.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.901
I know you're just trying
to protect your family.

13:40.968 --> 13:43.233
But so am I.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.034
You hate the sex scenes?
But those are my favorite.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.400
I don't hate the sex scenes.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.901
Well, then, why is red ink
all over the page?

13:58.968 --> 14:00.601
Red ink means bad.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.267
Bad, bad.

14:02.334 --> 14:04.001
I had a red pen.
I'll use blue next time.

14:04.068 --> 14:05.667
And I think the characters
should have sex.

14:05.734 --> 14:07.934
I just don't think it would
happen the way you wrote it.

14:08.001 --> 14:09.634
It did happen the way I wrote it.

14:11.133 --> 14:12.801
I mean, it would. It just
doesn't seem realistic to me.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.233
The girl rips her clothes off

14:14.300 --> 14:16.233
and throws herself at
the guy for no reason?

14:16.300 --> 14:19.200
I just can't see that happening.

14:19.267 --> 14:22.100
Huh.

14:24.867 --> 14:28.467
You don't need a lot.
Maybe just a line or two.

14:30.267 --> 14:32.467
Can you see it happening now?

14:32.534 --> 14:34.734
No! Oh, God. No.

14:34.801 --> 14:36.867
No. I can't. Uh...

14:36.934 --> 14:39.001
Oh, God. No.

14:39.068 --> 14:41.334
What's the matter?
We're working together.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.034
That's not how I work.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.100
This is how all guys work.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.767
Uh...

14:50.200 --> 14:51.467
You know...

14:51.534 --> 14:53.500
I thought you would actually
take this seriously,

14:53.567 --> 14:57.133
but I guess that was my mistake.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.801
Please tell me you're kidding.

15:05.867 --> 15:09.867
Okay, Alex. Settle down.
I'll be right over.

15:09.934 --> 15:11.300
Ready for lunch?

15:11.367 --> 15:13.334
I'm sorry. That was Alex, and
she's upset about something.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.434
And it's kind of my job
to take care of her.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

15:20.534 --> 15:23.801
Okay. I pulled some more ...

15:23.867 --> 15:25.867
Mouth, where'd Millie go?

15:25.934 --> 15:28.068
To take care of Alex.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.500
Oh, good.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.534
Get a shovel and help her
get rid of the body.

15:31.601 --> 15:32.934
Is she that bad?

15:33.001 --> 15:34.300
Should I be worried about Millie?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.667
Not unless you think Alex
is trying to sleep with her,

15:36.734 --> 15:38.068
so yes.

15:38.133 --> 15:39.867
She stayed out partying all night.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.034
She was probably celebrating,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.133
and I can't say that I blame her.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.701
Check these out.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.434
Wow.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.567
These are from last night?
Amazing, right?

15:52.634 --> 15:55.133
Totally not a turd sandwich.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.233
I asked her to do it full time.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.100
Did you ever think
you'd be dating a model?

16:07.233 --> 16:08.434
Well, how did you find out

16:08.500 --> 16:10.100
That your husband
was cheating on you?

16:10.167 --> 16:11.367
Which time?

16:13.267 --> 16:14.867
I always had my suspicions,
you know?

16:14.934 --> 16:16.267
But I didn't find out for sure

16:16.334 --> 16:19.434
until I walked in on him
having sex with my neighbor,

16:19.500 --> 16:21.601
and even then he tried to deny it.

16:23.068 --> 16:25.467
The only thing that men
do more than cheat

16:25.534 --> 16:26.968
is lie.

16:29.534 --> 16:30.901
Courtney Smith?

16:30.968 --> 16:34.034
Your husband's here to bail you out.

16:34.100 --> 16:37.467
That's me.
I'll see you around.

16:37.534 --> 16:39.233
You're going back to him?

16:39.300 --> 16:43.068
What am I gonna do?
I love him.

16:54.968 --> 16:57.434
You're not actually
gonna call him, are you?

16:57.500 --> 17:01.133
No matter what, Nathan
will always be my son.

17:01.200 --> 17:05.567
Tell him that.

17:05.634 --> 17:09.166
How can you be so soft on the inside...

17:09.233 --> 17:12.534
and so hard on the outside?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.800
Not now.

17:33.867 --> 17:35.267
You okay? Who is it?

17:35.334 --> 17:36.634
It's nobody.

17:36.701 --> 17:38.801
What do you want?
Hi, Nathan.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.867
I heard about your problem.
I was wondering if I could ...

17:40.934 --> 17:42.233
If you could what? Help?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.133
You made a fortune
capitalizing on the murder

17:44.200 --> 17:45.467
of your own brother.

17:45.534 --> 17:47.267
You save your help for
people who don't know you

17:47.334 --> 17:48.867
and stay away from me and my family.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.701
Okay, then.

17:53.767 --> 17:56.133
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.701
Good talking to you, too.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.133
Please try your call again later.
Okay.

18:01.667 --> 18:05.267
You'll never find forgiveness
from your family.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.300
You know, Jame,
you're a smart kid,

18:24.367 --> 18:26.467
but you're not quite Beethoven.

18:29.034 --> 18:31.934
Are you hungry? Can
I make you something?

18:32.001 --> 18:34.467
Will you take me to see my mom?

18:36.367 --> 18:37.801
Your dad will be home soon.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.901
We wouldn't want to be gone
when she gets home, would we?

18:42.968 --> 18:44.901
I guess not.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.267
Do you still love uncle David?

18:51.968 --> 18:54.300
Yeah.
Why would you ask me that?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.001
Why aren't you with him?

18:59.634 --> 19:01.934
It's a lot of little things.

19:02.001 --> 19:03.901
Like what?

19:03.968 --> 19:06.367
I don't know.

19:06.434 --> 19:08.034
It's complicated.

19:09.534 --> 19:11.300
That's not a very good answer.

19:12.567 --> 19:15.001
I know.

19:15.068 --> 19:18.767
Actually, I could go for some cereal.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.867
Yeah?

19:22.100 --> 19:23.634
Let's go.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.934
Renee dropped the charges,
so this should all go away.

19:38.001 --> 19:39.867
Well, Renee is not going away.

19:39.934 --> 19:41.901
We need to do something about it.

19:41.968 --> 19:43.300
I'm on it.

19:43.367 --> 19:44.634
Really?

19:44.701 --> 19:46.601
'Cause from the looks
of things this morning,

19:46.667 --> 19:47.834
you were on something else.

19:47.901 --> 19:50.300
Hey. Are you okay?

19:50.367 --> 19:52.367
Yeah.
I just want to get out of here.

19:52.434 --> 19:54.334
Oh, I wish you would
have just stayed home

19:54.400 --> 19:55.767
and let me take care of this.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.034
Why? What's the big deal?

20:00.801 --> 20:04.500
Come on.

20:04.567 --> 20:07.133
Mr. Scott!
Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!

20:26.300 --> 20:28.100
Hey, bud,
how do you like your cereal?

20:28.167 --> 20:31.300
Cereal? You just poured milk
over a bowl of cookies.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.734
Are you complaining?

20:33.801 --> 20:34.801
No.

20:36.133 --> 20:38.068
Hold on. I'll be right back.

20:45.867 --> 20:47.267
David.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.400
I just need to know one thing.

20:49.467 --> 20:51.634
Did you go home with
that guy last night?

20:53.867 --> 20:55.734
Yeah.

20:55.801 --> 20:59.667
So I guess I was wrong.

20:59.734 --> 21:03.167
There was something you could
do to make me give up hope.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.001
Uncle David!

21:06.068 --> 21:07.068
Are you gonna stay with us?

21:07.133 --> 21:08.968
Hey, bud.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.968
I'm sorry. I can't. I just
came by to say hi to you...

21:14.400 --> 21:16.300
and goodbye to your aunt Quinn.

21:25.434 --> 21:26.400
Hey, you!
Hey.

21:26.467 --> 21:27.667
Where you been?

21:27.734 --> 21:30.034
I went to visit my pilot
boyfriend this morning.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.233
Hmm. He sounds cool.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.367
Yeah, almost as cool as
my bartender boyfriend.

21:35.434 --> 21:36.801
That's "bar manager."

21:36.867 --> 21:37.968
Oh.

21:38.034 --> 21:39.500
Mia, have you heard from Haley today?

21:39.567 --> 21:41.034
She's supposed to be in the studio.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.701
No, not a peep.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.667
Well, see if you can find her,

21:44.734 --> 21:47.767
considering you're such
good friends and alike.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.467
Hmm.

21:49.534 --> 21:52.367
I really wish you worked at a bar

21:52.434 --> 21:53.901
that wasn't attached to my studio.

21:55.434 --> 21:58.367
I won't be working at any bar
once I get my pilot's license.

21:58.434 --> 22:00.500
I owe that to you.

22:00.567 --> 22:02.767
You're the one that inspired
me to follow my dreams.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.367
How did I do that?

22:04.434 --> 22:05.701
By following yours.

22:05.767 --> 22:07.267
And I never would have met you

22:07.334 --> 22:09.934
if the bar that I work at
wasn't attached to your studio.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.901
I really hope you make a better
pilot than you do a bartender.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.901
That's "manager."

22:23.968 --> 22:25.601
We need to go on the offensive

22:25.667 --> 22:27.400
before this thing gets any bigger.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.167
I'm gonna schedule a
press conference today

22:29.233 --> 22:30.667
so you can make an official statement.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.100
And what good will that do?

22:32.167 --> 22:34.100
It'll give people a chance
to see who you really are...

22:34.167 --> 22:35.901
an honest family man
with his wife by his side.

22:35.968 --> 22:37.467
You want me there?

22:37.534 --> 22:39.601
Definitely... I think it's
really important that we show

22:39.667 --> 22:41.200
that you support Nathan
through all this.

22:41.267 --> 22:43.367
And you really think making
a statement is gonna help?

22:43.434 --> 22:45.734
Yeah, look, how much,
I don't know,

22:45.801 --> 22:47.100
but it'll definitely help.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.267
Mom!

22:56.233 --> 22:58.834
Set up the press conference.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.467
Hi. How's the story coming?

23:07.534 --> 23:09.400
It better not have a happy ending.

23:09.467 --> 23:11.867
Nope. No worries there.
It's over.

23:11.934 --> 23:13.068
What happened?

23:13.133 --> 23:14.734
Let's just say...

23:14.801 --> 23:16.634
she's the person you thought she was.

23:16.701 --> 23:18.934
Does Brooke Davis have to slap a bitch?

23:19.001 --> 23:20.400
No, baby.

23:20.467 --> 23:23.034
I just won't be working with
her anymore. She's all yours.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.267
I'm sorry, babe.

23:25.334 --> 23:26.867
Are you okay?

23:26.934 --> 23:29.968
Yeah, it's just I hadn't found
a script I liked that much

23:30.034 --> 23:32.167
in a long time.

23:32.233 --> 23:33.701
I can't believe I was stupid enough

23:33.767 --> 23:35.233
to think she'd take it seriously.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.801
Well, you'll find a better script.

23:37.867 --> 23:40.767
Yeah?

23:40.834 --> 23:43.467
I guess it's back to renting
movies instead of making them.

23:43.534 --> 23:44.801
Any suggestions?

23:47.601 --> 23:50.233
Something that'll put
you in a better mood,

23:50.300 --> 23:53.100
or at least in the mood
to make out with me.

23:53.167 --> 23:55.434
"Grease 2" it is.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.534
Again?

23:57.601 --> 23:59.701
You're weird.

24:06.567 --> 24:08.500
Hey, you.

24:10.567 --> 24:12.400
You got any good
stories from the inside?

24:14.100 --> 24:18.167
Actually, um...
Renee came by.

24:19.534 --> 24:21.233
What did she want?

24:21.300 --> 24:23.834
Just to tell me that
she's dropping the charges,

24:23.901 --> 24:27.701
and, uh, she's still insisting
that you're the father.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.167
She's crazy.

24:29.233 --> 24:31.334
Yeah, I know.
That's what I told her.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.367
She's just so certain.

24:33.434 --> 24:35.267
You don't remember
meeting her at all or...?

24:35.334 --> 24:37.100
No.

24:37.167 --> 24:40.367
Were you drinking a lot that night?

24:40.434 --> 24:42.567
You're actually starting
to believe her, aren't you?

24:42.634 --> 24:44.267
I'm not. Of course not.

24:44.334 --> 24:46.467
I just don't understand why she
would make something like this up.

24:46.534 --> 24:47.801
I mean, if it's all a lie,

24:47.867 --> 24:49.467
we're gonna find out when
the baby comes out anyway.

24:49.534 --> 24:52.300
So why would she do that?

24:52.367 --> 24:54.167
She's trying to take
advantage of us, Haley.

24:54.233 --> 24:56.001
Why you?

24:57.767 --> 24:59.200
Great.

24:59.267 --> 25:02.068
You're the one person
I need to believe me,

25:02.133 --> 25:03.567
and you think I'm lying.

25:03.634 --> 25:04.867
I didn't say that.

25:04.934 --> 25:07.133
You didn't have to.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.334
Nathan.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.200
Where are you going?

25:11.267 --> 25:15.034
Out. And don't worry... I'll
try not to knock anyone up.

25:27.001 --> 25:28.268
There's been a mistake.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.801
I ordered my meal alfresco,

25:30.867 --> 25:33.767
but I don't want to eat it outside!

25:33.834 --> 25:35.101
And I'm still missing my...

25:39.067 --> 25:40.567
You're not a cheesecake.

25:40.634 --> 25:43.600
What do you do? Do you shake
hands by spreading your legs?

25:43.667 --> 25:45.234
A guy was finally interested

25:45.300 --> 25:47.134
in your writing instead of your body,

25:47.201 --> 25:49.700
and you did what you do best...
you blew it.

25:49.767 --> 25:51.333
Brooke, I'm sorry.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.934
I made a mistake.

25:54.001 --> 25:55.934
He was giving you a chance to
show the world that you are more

25:56.001 --> 25:58.534
than just another stupid,
washed-up actress,

25:58.600 --> 26:00.734
but you proved that that's
exactly what you are.

26:00.801 --> 26:02.134
Nice work.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.634
Oh, no. I'll be taking this.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.667
We at least need your body in shape

26:08.734 --> 26:11.467
since it's all you've got going for you.

26:20.901 --> 26:23.001
Why didn't you tell me
they took you off the air?

26:23.067 --> 26:24.467
When did I have a chance...

26:24.534 --> 26:26.268
last night when you were with Alex

26:26.333 --> 26:28.801
or this afternoon when
you ran off to be with Alex?

26:28.867 --> 26:30.534
I'm sorry, Marvin.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.134
I'm here now.
Do you want to talk about it?

26:33.201 --> 26:36.300
Not really.

26:36.367 --> 26:38.234
I, uh,
saw your photos from last night.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.967
You looked beautiful.

26:40.034 --> 26:42.934
Brooke thinks you should be a model.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.300
What do you think?

26:45.367 --> 26:48.567
I think you've worked for five
years to get where you are.

26:48.634 --> 26:50.767
But it's something new and different.

26:50.834 --> 26:54.067
I didn't know you wanted
new and different.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.801
Neither did I.

26:56.867 --> 26:58.934
But it's just you always
said that, you know,

26:59.001 --> 27:01.268
dealing with models was
the worst part of your job.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.168
But that doesn't mean I'd be like them.

27:03.234 --> 27:05.934
You mean like partying all night
and showing up late for work?

27:06.001 --> 27:08.934
How does that make you any different?

27:09.001 --> 27:11.934
I see you've given
this a lot of thought.

27:12.001 --> 27:14.567
I just don't think it's who you are.

27:14.634 --> 27:15.967
And did you decide that

27:16.034 --> 27:19.700
all by yourself down
here in the basement?

27:29.500 --> 27:32.168
Your boyfriend works in a sewer?

27:32.234 --> 27:34.367
What? I said, "basement."

27:34.433 --> 27:36.734
And that wasn't even
the point of my story!

27:36.801 --> 27:38.001
Whatever. Let's do this.

27:38.067 --> 27:39.934
And make sure you tell me
when we're buzzed.

27:40.001 --> 27:40.967
I love that part.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.500
Mm.mm.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.101
Brooke wants me to be a model.

27:48.168 --> 27:50.034
Right, which would be awesome.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.667
And Marvin wasn't excited.

27:52.734 --> 27:54.268
First of all...

27:54.333 --> 27:57.367
his name is Marvin.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.300
And second of all,
he works in a sewer.

27:59.367 --> 28:02.268
Ugh! I mean,
who cares what he thinks?

28:02.333 --> 28:04.767
I am tired of people thinking things.

28:06.234 --> 28:07.567
What do you think?

28:07.634 --> 28:09.967
I don't know.
It might be fun.

28:10.034 --> 28:11.467
Then do it.

28:11.534 --> 28:12.767
What if I don't like it?

28:12.834 --> 28:15.567
Then quit. I mean,
that's what I'd do.

28:15.634 --> 28:17.700
But don't ask me. I'm stupid.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.268
Just ask Brooke.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.433
I'm sure she doesn't think that.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.634
Mm. She does.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.367
She came over earlier,
told me I was stupid,

28:26.433 --> 28:27.867
and then stole my cheesecake,

28:27.934 --> 28:30.600
but the joke's on her because
I just ordered another one.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.901
Look who's stupid now, Brooke.

28:32.967 --> 28:34.934
I doubt she meant it.

28:35.001 --> 28:36.734
And I don't really care
what Brooke thinks.

28:36.801 --> 28:38.234
I care about Julian.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.634
He was the one who
believed in my script.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.600
Okay. We're buzzed.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.001
I love it!

28:47.067 --> 28:48.400
You know,
I could really use a lime.

28:48.467 --> 28:51.034
And I want the tequila,
so we're even.

28:51.101 --> 28:53.634
So, show Julian you aren't stupid.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.134
Make him see you in a new light,

28:56.201 --> 28:59.034
like the way you made
people see me as a model.

28:59.101 --> 29:01.001
You are a model, bitch.

29:01.067 --> 29:03.433
And you're not stupid, bitch.
Now go show Julian that.

29:04.734 --> 29:07.268
Thanks. Will you help me
pick out a nerdy outfit?

29:07.333 --> 29:09.901
Just pretend I'm you.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.634
Uh-oh.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.901
Haley's at the piano.

29:28.967 --> 29:32.001
I'm a musician, Quinn.

29:32.067 --> 29:34.134
Spill it.

29:36.001 --> 29:37.433
Did David ever lie to you

29:37.500 --> 29:41.700
about something, like,
really important?

29:41.767 --> 29:44.433
Lying was never really David's style.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.934
He's like Nathan in that way.

29:47.001 --> 29:48.234
Why?

29:50.600 --> 29:52.500
It's just this...

29:52.567 --> 29:54.634
It just scares me is all.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.400
If you and David can split up

29:56.467 --> 29:58.500
and you loved each other so much,

29:58.567 --> 30:00.901
how are Nathan and I
ever gonna make it?

30:03.467 --> 30:06.801
Because you're not us, Hales.

30:06.867 --> 30:08.767
I mean,
I see the way you two act.

30:08.834 --> 30:12.667
You're like best
friends who are in love.

30:12.734 --> 30:13.901
You know, you and Nathan

30:13.967 --> 30:15.467
still do the little
things for each other,

30:15.534 --> 30:19.734
and David and I stopped doing
those things a long time ago.

30:19.834 --> 30:22.001
You know, we stopped
being kind to each other.

30:22.067 --> 30:24.767
And we stopped being
captivated by each other.

30:24.834 --> 30:27.400
And when we stopped
doing the little things,

30:27.467 --> 30:29.433
we stopped doing the big things, too,

30:29.500 --> 30:32.734
you know, like saying,
"I love you."

30:32.801 --> 30:34.567
But David is saying that now.

30:34.634 --> 30:36.734
Doesn't that count for anything?

30:38.834 --> 30:40.500
It does.

30:40.567 --> 30:43.901
And, in a way, I'm... I'm
always gonna love David.

30:45.801 --> 30:48.867
But it's been over for a long time,

30:48.934 --> 30:51.500
and I think he's now realizing that.

30:53.634 --> 30:57.867
You and Nathan are gonna be just fine.

30:57.934 --> 31:00.134
Yeah. I hope so.

31:00.201 --> 31:02.268
I just hate that it has to be so hard.

31:02.333 --> 31:03.467
I know.

31:03.534 --> 31:05.500
But we can handle it.

31:05.567 --> 31:07.168
We're James girls.

31:07.234 --> 31:09.433
Mm.

31:11.134 --> 31:13.867
Bring it in.

31:13.934 --> 31:16.333
I love you.

31:20.168 --> 31:23.834
Is this the support group
for husbands of James girls?

31:23.901 --> 31:25.867
I'll have a double of
whatever he's having.

31:25.934 --> 31:28.500
A double water.

31:28.567 --> 31:30.268
You know, we do have
drinks here, guys.

31:32.634 --> 31:34.734
Water it is.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.634
That's probably a smart move.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.801
I wouldn't know.

31:40.867 --> 31:42.433
I haven't made a smart move in years.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.901
Haley got arrested this morning.

31:49.967 --> 31:53.067
She hit a girl last night who
claims I got her pregnant.

31:53.134 --> 31:54.201
Did you?

31:54.268 --> 31:55.901
No.

31:55.967 --> 31:57.534
But it doesn't seem to matter.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.567
I think Haley's starting to doubt me,

31:59.634 --> 32:01.400
and to be honest,
I don't blame her.

32:01.467 --> 32:03.433
At this point...

32:03.500 --> 32:05.801
I'd doubt me, too,
if I was her.

32:10.134 --> 32:12.300
Did Quinn come home last night?

32:21.600 --> 32:24.101
So, that's it, right?

32:24.168 --> 32:25.700
It's over.

32:28.034 --> 32:31.134
You know, when Haley
went on tour, we split up.

32:31.201 --> 32:33.467
I thought it was over.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.867
No matter what I tried,
I could not get her back.

32:38.300 --> 32:41.901
So, as much as it killed me,
I let her go.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.567
But I never gave up hope.

32:45.634 --> 32:49.134
Did Haley sleep with someone?

32:49.201 --> 32:52.001
Well, there was a guy.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.801
Did she sleep with him?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.367
No.

33:03.001 --> 33:04.534
Yeah.

33:11.134 --> 33:12.934
I changed the sex scene.

33:13.001 --> 33:15.067
Now the girl makes an ass of herself

33:15.134 --> 33:16.967
and the guy leaves.

33:19.034 --> 33:21.333
That's more realistic.

33:21.400 --> 33:25.500
I... I know you're upset with
me, but that's just what I do.

33:25.567 --> 33:27.367
I am the girl who takes off her clothes

33:27.433 --> 33:29.168
and sleeps with guys.

33:29.234 --> 33:32.268
Yeah.
Well, I'm not one of those guys.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.433
I know.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.801
You're the first guy to ever notice me

33:34.867 --> 33:36.168
for something other than

33:36.234 --> 33:38.134
getting photographed
with no underwear

33:38.201 --> 33:40.367
or videotaping threesomes.

33:40.433 --> 33:43.367
We've all been there.

33:43.433 --> 33:45.367
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

33:45.433 --> 33:47.333
You gave me the chance to prove to you

33:47.400 --> 33:49.134
I wasn't just some washed-up actress

33:49.201 --> 33:51.667
and, instead,
I showed you that I was.

33:51.734 --> 33:53.767
You showed me a lot
more than that, Alex.

33:55.801 --> 33:58.067
Look, I just think we don't
work very well together.

33:58.134 --> 34:00.433
We have very different styles.

34:00.500 --> 34:03.734
Okay, but if you would just
give me one more chance,

34:03.801 --> 34:06.168
I promise I wouldn't let you down.

34:06.234 --> 34:09.333
If not,
thanks for a really great day,

34:09.400 --> 34:11.400
until I screwed it up.

34:23.301 --> 34:25.567
Hey. You look good. I came
up with a list of questions

34:25.632 --> 34:26.900
they're probably gonna ask.

34:26.967 --> 34:28.001
You and Haley should be ready.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.867
Haley's not coming.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.533
Nate, that is not a good idea, man.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.867
You going out there by
yourself will not look good.

34:33.934 --> 34:35.833
You know what else doesn't look good?

34:35.900 --> 34:37.734
You and Quinn.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.699
What's that supposed to mean?

34:39.766 --> 34:42.234
It means I need your head in the game

34:42.301 --> 34:43.699
and not up Quinn's skirt.

34:43.766 --> 34:45.900
What part of sleeping with her
did you think was a good idea?

34:45.967 --> 34:49.266
She's married, Clay,
to a guy I really like.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.467
Nothing happened last night, Nate.

34:51.533 --> 34:53.134
Right, so you... what?

34:53.201 --> 34:55.500
You took her back to your
place so you guys could talk?

34:55.567 --> 34:57.201
As a matter of fact, yes.

34:57.267 --> 34:59.633
I was actually helping her out.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.301
I would have thought you of all people

35:01.368 --> 35:03.134
would understand about
jumping to conclusions.

35:05.267 --> 35:08.167
Whatever. I'm ... I'm sorry.
You need to be focused.

35:08.234 --> 35:10.301
Let's, uh...
let's just do this, okay?

35:10.368 --> 35:11.734
Clay...

35:11.800 --> 35:14.934
if I could distance myself
from this woman, I would,

35:15.001 --> 35:16.301
but I can't.

35:16.368 --> 35:17.800
Now, you can.

35:17.867 --> 35:20.334
Quinn is Haley's sister. She
has a lot going on right now.

35:20.401 --> 35:23.334
Stay away from her, okay?

35:24.867 --> 35:27.001
Whatever you say.

35:29.134 --> 35:30.867
Hey.

35:30.934 --> 35:32.967
What are you ...
what are you doing here?

35:33.034 --> 35:35.834
We face things together, remember?

35:38.667 --> 35:40.234
Thank you.

35:40.301 --> 35:42.567
I didn't know if I could do
this without you.

35:42.633 --> 35:46.533
You don't ever have to worry about that.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.467
Thank you for coming.

36:10.534 --> 36:13.367
I'm here to set the record straight.

36:13.434 --> 36:14.800
First of all,

36:14.867 --> 36:17.800
I just want to say that
I love my wife and my son.

36:21.933 --> 36:26.100
You want to tell me what
this was doing in the trash?

36:28.833 --> 36:30.701
I don't like the po-po.

36:32.467 --> 36:35.401
Sweetie, they were just doing their job.

36:35.467 --> 36:37.334
Mommy made a mistake,

36:37.401 --> 36:39.134
and they needed to talk to me about it.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.601
Just keep the toy, baby.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.000
Are you and dad gonna leave each other

36:44.067 --> 36:46.267
like aunt Quinn and uncle David?

36:46.334 --> 36:50.734
Hey. Come here.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.401
Of course not.

36:52.467 --> 36:55.334
Your daddy and I love
each other very much.

36:55.401 --> 36:58.334
But aunt Quinn and uncle
David loved each other, too,

36:58.401 --> 36:59.634
then they stopped.

37:02.900 --> 37:04.534
Listen.

37:04.601 --> 37:08.434
What your dad and I
have is very special,

37:08.501 --> 37:11.967
and I promise you we are not
gonna stop loving each other.

37:13.867 --> 37:15.867
Don't forget that.

37:20.668 --> 37:22.900
Good night.

37:22.967 --> 37:24.567
Can you stay a little bit longer?

37:27.100 --> 37:28.401
Sure, sweetie.

37:37.534 --> 37:38.900
I would never do anything

37:38.967 --> 37:41.034
to hurt the people that I care about.

37:44.534 --> 37:47.000
Are you sure we won't
get in trouble for this?

37:47.067 --> 37:50.768
Relax.
I do this all the time.

37:50.867 --> 37:53.701
You know, I thought i'd be
afraid of flying with you,

37:53.768 --> 37:55.701
but I'm actually kind of turned on.

37:55.768 --> 38:00.334
You got 30 seconds to join
the mile-high club, captain?

38:00.334 --> 38:02.367
Flying isn't the only thing
i've been practicing.

38:02.434 --> 38:03.734
I'm up to a couple minutes now.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.768
Oh, yeah?

38:17.734 --> 38:22.067
I know some of you are looking
at me in a different light,

38:22.134 --> 38:25.434
but I urge you to see me for who I am.

38:25.501 --> 38:28.567
I'll do it.
I'll model for you.

38:37.234 --> 38:40.034
I've always prided myself
on being an honest man

38:40.100 --> 38:42.000
and taking responsibility
for my actions.

38:42.067 --> 38:44.167
All right,
Bobcat fans, coming up,

38:44.234 --> 38:46.134
local sports star Nathan Scott

38:46.200 --> 38:49.534
speaks out regarding recent
allegations against him.

38:49.601 --> 38:52.467
You know, it must be hard to log
tapes from here, huh, Marvin?

38:52.534 --> 38:53.967
...And as well as some early NFL news

38:54.034 --> 38:57.034
for you fantasy-football junkies.

39:02.833 --> 39:05.668
I'm someone that you can depend on.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.034
And I'm someone that can be trusted.

39:09.367 --> 39:12.067
Honey, I'm home.
Let's do this.

39:12.134 --> 39:14.301
I told you it was realistic.

39:15.234 --> 39:17.301
Um, hey, honey.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.701
Alex and I worked everything out.

39:22.933 --> 39:24.501
Isn't that great?

39:28.334 --> 39:30.768
I want everyone to know the truth,

39:30.833 --> 39:33.434
and the truth is that I was
never with that woman.

39:36.167 --> 39:37.367
Hey, man.

39:37.434 --> 39:40.134
Hey, do you know where Quinn is?

39:40.200 --> 39:42.967
No. Sorry.
I haven't seen her.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.034
Thanks for letting me stay here.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.634
I know it puts you in a bad position.

39:50.701 --> 39:53.900
There's just a lot of drama
at Nathan and Haley's.

39:53.967 --> 39:57.000
It's fine. You can stay here
as long as you want.

39:59.734 --> 40:01.401
So, what would people say if they knew

40:01.467 --> 40:04.434
that you had a girl over you
weren't actually sleeping with?

40:07.134 --> 40:09.933
Nobody would believe it.

40:18.634 --> 40:20.867
I just want to say that
I believe my husband

40:20.933 --> 40:23.534
and I stand by him 100%.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.668
You've reached Renee.
Leave a message.

41:10.367 --> 41:12.167
I'll do whatever it takes

41:12.234 --> 41:14.833
to prove that these
allegations are false.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.567
Hopefully now this can all go away

41:17.634 --> 41:20.401
and my family can be left alone.

41:20.467 --> 41:22.867
Thank you.

41:22.933 --> 41:26.167
I trust you had a nice flight.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.601
I have a proposition for you.
