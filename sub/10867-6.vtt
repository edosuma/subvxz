00:33.534 --> 00:35.453
This is getting
like, disgusting.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.788
That's the beauty of it!

00:36.788 --> 00:39.832
We never have to clean.

00:40.750 --> 00:41.590
Ahhhhh!

00:43.294 --> 00:45.713
See!
It's infested!

00:46.756 --> 00:48.340
It's just Jerry.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.425
Jerry?

00:49.425 --> 00:51.218
Vange's pet rat.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.637
He's a mouse!

00:52.637 --> 00:54.806
He's a rodent!
Get him out of here.

00:54.806 --> 01:00.645
Stop, you guys!
You're hurting his feelings.

01:00.645 --> 01:04.732
Sorry guys, the
chain broke on my bike.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.317
Or should I say,
Gary's old bike.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.027
Piece of junk.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.404
Just once I'd wish I
didn't get a a hand-me-down.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.073
Oh..that's something
you didn't get new.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.076
I know what a hand-me-down is!

01:17.912 --> 01:21.332
Well that's sort of
what my story's about.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.375
See, if you're getting
something second hand,

01:23.375 --> 01:25.920
you're gettin' something
that's already got a history.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.632
It's used, it's worn,
it might even be busted.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.592
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.803
It's like gettin'
somebody else's troubles.

01:33.803 --> 01:35.680
But now they're YOUR troubles.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.641
In my story, a couple
of guys take on

01:38.641 --> 01:40.518
somebody else's troubles...

01:40.518 --> 01:42.561
and they've gotta
deal with 'em...

01:42.561 --> 01:46.524
cuz if they don't, they might
not live long enough to ever get

01:46.524 --> 01:50.361
another hand-me-down again.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.741
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:55.741 --> 01:59.370
I call this story...

02:10.214 --> 02:12.842
Justin was the kind of guy
you could always trust...

02:12.842 --> 02:14.927
no matter what.

02:17.055 --> 02:20.474
Just great.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.185
Craig, on the other hand,
was kind of a wild guy,

02:23.185 --> 02:25.730
and that usually
meant trouble for Justin.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.982
But they were best
buds since kindergarten,

02:27.982 --> 02:30.442
and when you've been
friends that long,

02:30.442 --> 02:32.444
you put up with a lot.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.405
Justin!
Buddy!!

02:34.405 --> 02:35.489
You save me a slice?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.615
My Mother's gonna be ticked.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.492
Where did you go?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.828
Sorry. I was just over talking
to Ronnie at the Shop'N'Drop.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.455
Ronnie? MY Ronnie??
Why were you talking to her?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.083
Why not?

02:45.083 --> 02:46.876
Because you know I...

02:46.876 --> 02:49.294
Because you're too chicken
to ask her out yourself.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.672
Ah...I can't believe this!

02:51.672 --> 02:54.592
I lend you my car so you strand
me here to put the moves

02:54.592 --> 02:56.135
on the girl I want to ask out.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.096
What kind of friend are you?

02:58.096 --> 02:59.972
The best you got.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.105
Huh...ahhh!

03:07.105 --> 03:10.649
I...I kinda got too close to the
drive-thru window at Winky's.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.234
My Mom's gonna kill me.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.736
No sweat okay.

03:13.736 --> 03:16.072
Just, when you pull into
the garage park real close

03:16.072 --> 03:17.656
to the wall; she'll
never notice.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.575
That's great, Craig.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.201
Good plan.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.245
Okay look, don't get
all crampy on me alright?

03:23.245 --> 03:25.998
Tomorrow we'll go down to the
junkyard and we'll get you

03:25.998 --> 03:28.208
a new mirror okay?.

03:29.293 --> 03:33.131
Hey, come on let
me see that smile.

03:33.131 --> 03:35.466
Come on.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.552
Just... great.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.861
And here we go!

03:57.613 --> 03:58.697
Ahh...
It's a '76.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.740
So?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.033
My mom will know.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.952
It's her car, a '78.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.204
The mirrors are more
rounder than the '76's.

04:05.204 --> 04:11.293
Man, someone must have been
flying to get wrecked this bad.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.172
I mean, you can almost
hear the smashing metal

04:14.172 --> 04:17.007
and the breaking glass
and crunching...

04:17.007 --> 04:19.093
Yeah, I get the picture.

04:19.093 --> 04:22.513
You're no fun!

04:32.314 --> 04:34.984
Hey, let's find the
nastiest wreck here.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.153
Don't be sick.
We're here to find a mirror.

04:37.153 --> 04:39.864
My mom's gonna kill me
-She's gonna kill you, I know.

04:39.864 --> 04:42.324
I don't know why you hang
onto that geek-mobile anyways.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.952
It gets me from here to there.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.246
Yeah, but you need a ride
that makes a statement,

04:47.246 --> 04:48.622
something with power.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.290
A car like, like -

04:50.290 --> 04:52.459
This one?

04:53.418 --> 04:57.256
Yeah.
Now that was a car.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.632
It still is.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.343
You never heard a
prettier engine man.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.303
It's a wreck!

05:03.303 --> 05:07.266
Just a little dirt
and rust, that's all.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.435
Purrs like a kitten.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.193
A DANGEROUS kitten.

05:17.193 --> 05:18.360
Sweet.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.528
Yeah it's great.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.030
Listen can we go back-

05:21.030 --> 05:23.199
Unbelievable!
How can a wreck sound so good?

05:23.199 --> 05:26.410
The owner of this place has no
idea what great shape it's in.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.330
A smart guy could
get it for a song.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.916
So why don't YOU buy it?

05:31.916 --> 05:36.254
Ah, I've had a couple
tickets, nothing serious,

05:36.254 --> 05:38.338
60 in a 35 zone.

05:38.338 --> 05:43.052
Bottom line, I got
my license yanked.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.392
How come the door doesn't work?

05:50.392 --> 05:53.062
You're a funny guy.
I like you. I do.

05:53.062 --> 05:55.106
But this baby ain't
for you, you know.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.523
But you...

05:56.523 --> 06:00.069
YOU, Ace, I can see
behind that wheel.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.779
Yeah. Me too.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.322
Wait, I-

06:03.322 --> 06:04.990
You and your friend could fix
it up. A little sanding,

06:04.990 --> 06:08.660
a coat of paint,
it's gonna shine like new.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.954
Yeah, we could, couldn't we?

06:09.954 --> 06:11.997
What's this "we" thing?

06:12.831 --> 06:14.541
You know what?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.834
I'm gonna buy it!

06:15.834 --> 06:17.044
I don't believe this!

06:17.044 --> 06:18.129
It's cool.

06:18.129 --> 06:19.713
Now you go talk to the owner.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.925
And he's gonna
practically give it away.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.885
Aren't you comin'?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.053
No, I'm gonna hang back.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.763
He sees me, he might
get suspicious

06:27.763 --> 06:30.182
and jack up the price.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.351
Alright!

06:32.351 --> 06:34.979
What about my mirror!?

06:34.979 --> 06:37.689
Hey, what's goin' on?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.816
Do you work here?

06:38.816 --> 06:41.360
Yeah...
Thought I heard an engine.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.487
You did, that one.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.655
That one?!

06:44.655 --> 06:46.740
My crazy friend's gonna buy it.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.368
But I'm looking for
a side view mirror,

06:49.368 --> 06:54.332
a '78, not a '76, the
'78 are more rounded.

06:54.332 --> 06:57.042
He-llo!
A little help here?

06:57.042 --> 07:00.712
Yeah, sure, let's take a look.

08:09.407 --> 08:12.701
Ah!
Now that is one sweet ride.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.120
I have to admit...
it's pretty nice.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.582
Nice job!

08:18.582 --> 08:19.958
Hey!

08:19.958 --> 08:23.128
From the junkyard, right?

08:23.128 --> 08:24.838
Found a '78 mirror.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.548
Yes!
Finally!

08:26.548 --> 08:27.841
You're a lifesaver!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.761
Now I can stop
parking against a wall.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.721
You really fixed her up.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.474
Yeah, it was a
boat load of work,

08:35.474 --> 08:38.977
but man, it's worth it.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.063
I'm gonna take
her out for a spin!

08:41.063 --> 08:42.563
I can't wait!

08:42.563 --> 08:45.943
Ahhhhhhhhh!!

08:45.943 --> 08:48.987
I think my Mom just
found my report card.

08:48.987 --> 08:53.451
That drive's gonna have
to wait. Later!

08:53.451 --> 08:55.286
Hey, thanks for
bringing this out.

08:55.286 --> 08:56.787
How much do I owe you?

08:56.787 --> 08:58.122
It's on the house.

08:58.122 --> 09:00.665
Really?
Thanks!

09:45.794 --> 09:46.794
Hey!

09:47.963 --> 09:49.465
I thought you were grounded.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.967
I am, but the warden's
at work so I thought

09:51.967 --> 09:53.177
I'd take her for spin.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.886
It's not even registered!

09:54.886 --> 09:57.473
So I'll just take her around
the block. You wanna come?

09:57.473 --> 09:58.474
Forget it.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.100
Okay.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.810
Maybe I'll huh..

10:01.810 --> 10:04.729
take her over to
the Shop N' Drop.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.273
To show Ronnie?

10:06.273 --> 10:06.993
Maybe.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.027
You're a piece of
work, you know?

10:10.027 --> 10:12.154
Just part of my charm.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.416
Ah!
Let's roll.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.294
Let's use our seat belts.

10:57.533 --> 11:01.328
Oh man!
Is this great or what?

11:01.328 --> 11:04.582
Hey, slow down,
it's gettin' foggy.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.292
[static]

11:08.335 --> 11:13.840
Man, great car, lousy radio.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.969
Lose the surfer music.

11:17.969 --> 11:18.969
[steel guitar music]

11:30.566 --> 11:32.568
Hey, when did they fix that up?

11:32.568 --> 11:35.820
Let's check it out.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.896
Whoa.
Blast from the past.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.190
Not very popular.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.319
Ace!
You made it!

12:15.319 --> 12:17.446
Hey!
You work here?

12:17.446 --> 12:19.698
I do a lot of things.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.450
How did you know we were coming?

12:21.450 --> 12:24.161
Hey, big guy!

12:24.161 --> 12:27.539
These boys are driving now.

12:28.165 --> 12:32.294
Is that right?

12:35.922 --> 12:39.092
If you're, huh, talking about
the monster V-8 out there,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.927
yeah, we're driving.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.013
You, huh, you got a
problem with that?

12:43.013 --> 12:45.516
Only if you get in my way.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.101
I know!
Let's leave!

12:48.101 --> 12:50.103
Yeah, get back on the road.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.188
Okay, look pal...

12:51.188 --> 12:53.524
Craig, come on!
We're going!

12:53.524 --> 12:55.817
See you out on Highway 13.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.402
Hey, nice threads, dude.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.572
Huh, do they sell men's
clothing where you got those?

13:04.326 --> 13:06.286
Can't you see when
we're headed for trouble?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.538
That guy was all mouth.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.581
Yeah, but it was
really scary mouth.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.292
Just...
chill, okay?!

13:12.292 --> 13:14.503
Something strange
is going on here.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.922
I mean this place was a
deserted wreck yesterday.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.134
Let's just get in the car
and go home. Alright?

13:21.134 --> 13:24.722
Yeah, alright, alright.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.832
Ahhh...I must have
missed the turn.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.670
Highway 13.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.591
Huh, didn't the Trucker guy
say something about Highway 13?

14:01.466 --> 14:05.429
[horn honking]

14:06.179 --> 14:06.899
Uh oh.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.350
He's just trying
to scare us.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.562
I'll lose him on the curves.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.036
He's doing a pretty good job
at this "scaring us" thing.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.749
Relax.
He's too big to keep up.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.377
Hang on there's a
turnoff comin' up right...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.504
Here!

14:47.763 --> 14:49.848
Youhou!
Haha!

14:49.848 --> 14:51.433
Piece of cake.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.101
Let's go home, alright?

14:53.101 --> 14:55.520
Yeah, okay. This comes out
right behind the school.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.231
We'll be home in just...

14:58.231 --> 15:00.275
Woaa?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.778
What the...

15:02.778 --> 15:05.322
How did THAT happen?

15:10.828 --> 15:13.664
Scared yet?

15:16.792 --> 15:21.839
What are you
doing back here Ace?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.175
That Trucker is after us!

15:25.175 --> 15:26.926
Emergency doesn't answer.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.846
We...huh, try the operator.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.930
That ain't gonna work.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.768
Told you.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.269
What's going on?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.021
It's no big deal, Ace.
Just a little contest.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.064
All you gotta do is beat him
to the bridge on Highway 13.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.941
What?
Why?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.443
You shouldn't have
brought them into this.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.237
Hey, someone's gotta
get us outta here.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.031
This is wrong.
They didn't know.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.033
Know what???

15:50.033 --> 15:51.702
Okay, here's the deal.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.621
My buddy had the sweetest
muscle car on the road,

15:54.621 --> 15:56.874
but he never let
it out, you know?

15:56.874 --> 15:58.583
Until one day...

15:58.583 --> 16:00.502
One day Bulldog here
got this Trucker mad

16:00.502 --> 16:02.170
and next thing we know...

16:02.170 --> 16:04.381
Next thing we know, he's
trying to run us off the road.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.007
Sounds familiar.
-Yeah.

16:06.007 --> 16:09.135
We ended up on Highway 13,
and there's this bridge,

16:09.135 --> 16:12.430
a tiny little thing, it's
not wide enough for two cars.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.558
We ended up racing for it.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.226
We didn't have a choice.
It was us or him.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.853
Side by side, headed
towards the bridge...

16:17.853 --> 16:20.021
I kept telling Tony
to punch it, but...

16:20.021 --> 16:22.232
I was scared, alright?

16:22.232 --> 16:26.778
We coulda beat him.
You choked.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.574
What happened?

16:30.574 --> 16:32.242
Wham!

16:32.242 --> 16:34.619
We hit the bridge
at the same time.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.789
Whoo!
What a crash!

16:37.789 --> 16:39.958
Messy, too.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.043
Didn't you guys get hurt?

16:42.043 --> 16:43.921
Hurt?

16:43.921 --> 16:44.771
No we all...
died!

16:49.509 --> 16:50.349
WHAT???

16:53.096 --> 16:54.848
It happened in 1969.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.975
We've been racing the
same guy ever since,

16:56.975 --> 17:00.353
every day, same time,
same thing always happens.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.646
Boom.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.900
So you guys are like... like...

17:04.900 --> 17:08.361
Dead.
Like two sorry doornails.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.820
We need somebody
to beat that guy.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.321
And I figured
you're the man, Ace.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.782
All you gotta do is
race him to the bridge,

17:12.782 --> 17:14.617
beat him, and we
can all go home.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.040
The back door!

17:24.920 --> 17:26.922
[horn honking]

17:26.922 --> 17:29.007
You can't run away, Ace.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.634
The car is yours now.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.012
And he's gonna keep coming
back until you race him.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.100
I'm sorry, man.
I really am.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.437
I got you into this and
I'm gonna get you out.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.648
It's okay, we're
not going to race.

17:44.648 --> 17:48.192
You gotta.
There's no other way.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.360
Okay, check the phone again.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.822
But...
-Just do it!

18:00.246 --> 18:00.966
Craig!

18:02.206 --> 18:06.753
Gentlemen, start your engines.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.548
Craig, don't!

18:16.888 --> 18:20.099
Alright, which
way is that bridge?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.196
You gotta get to the bridge.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.739
Straight ahead, Ace.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.700
Straight ahead, Ace.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.118
Straight ahead.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.338
Keep dodging,
don't let him past!

18:50.338 --> 18:54.051
Knock it off!
I'm trying to drive.

19:13.611 --> 19:17.032
I told you not to
let him pull even!

19:17.032 --> 19:19.492
Give it more!
You got it, don't waste it!

19:19.492 --> 19:20.493
There's the bridge!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.495
I got it!
I got it!

19:28.167 --> 19:29.586
Come on, give it more!

19:29.586 --> 19:30.486
Come on, let's go!

19:35.383 --> 19:40.638
Faster, that's it, come on.

19:44.101 --> 19:44.941
Yeahhh!

19:49.480 --> 19:51.691
Yeehaa!

19:51.691 --> 19:54.318
I knew we'd beat that guy!

19:54.318 --> 19:56.738
The second I saw him I
knew he could be taken.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.448
Wait a minute this
race was YOUR idea?

19:58.448 --> 19:59.783
It was ALL his idea!

19:59.783 --> 20:01.576
He went after the
Trucker, he made me

20:01.576 --> 20:03.161
chase it, he challenged him.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.038
It wasn't the
Trucker's fault, it was ours!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.372
Ahhhhhaaa!

20:06.372 --> 20:09.000
We got him now!

20:12.003 --> 20:15.924
WHAT ARE YOU DOING???

20:20.678 --> 20:21.638
Wooohhh!

20:23.473 --> 20:25.391
You blew it!

20:25.391 --> 20:27.060
You could've beat him.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.646
Yeah, but you never should
have raced in the first place.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.983
Either way it's over... ACE.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.067
I don't believe it!

20:34.067 --> 20:38.029
All these years and we lost!!!

20:38.029 --> 20:41.282
You had the guts to
do what I couldn't.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.122
Thanks.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.830
So, huh, you want your car back?

20:46.830 --> 20:49.916
She is sweet, isn't she.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.753
Yeah, a little TOO sweet.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.844
Hey, hey, hey,
whe...where you going?

21:00.844 --> 21:03.180
As far away from
here as possible.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.431
Hey, don't be sore.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.853
It's cool.

21:40.591 --> 21:43.053
What happened?

21:43.053 --> 21:44.345
I lost...

21:44.345 --> 21:46.597
it was great.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.808
[horn honking]

21:48.808 --> 21:50.601
Woa...

21:58.818 --> 22:01.362
Last thing I wanted was a race.

22:01.362 --> 22:04.657
Yeah, we know that now.

22:04.657 --> 22:08.619
Thanks for lettin' me get home.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.798
So it was the two guy's fault?

22:20.798 --> 22:22.717
Yeah.

22:22.717 --> 22:27.471
I can't imagine anybody
being so irresponsible.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.477
There's something
I didn't tell you.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.771
What's that?

22:34.771 --> 22:37.023
I was talking to
Ronnie about YOU.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.441
She thinks you're cute...

22:38.441 --> 22:41.069
Really?
You think she'd go out with me?

22:41.069 --> 22:43.654
Now that you'd have to
figure out on your own.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.489
Aw, c'mon!

22:45.489 --> 22:46.783
I need guidance!

22:46.783 --> 22:48.326
You need guidance?

22:50.245 --> 22:52.496
So before you
take a hand-me-down,

22:52.496 --> 22:55.374
make sure you know what
you're really getting.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.127
The end.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.795
Awesome.
-That was great!

22:58.795 --> 23:00.046
It was a good story.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.256
Wasn't that great?

23:01.256 --> 23:03.424
I think I have a
hand-me- down too.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.550
You THINK?

23:04.550 --> 23:05.927
Yeah.

23:05.927 --> 23:08.346
I think my mother gave
me her fear of mice.

23:08.346 --> 23:13.017
But I want to deal with it so...

23:16.395 --> 23:18.856
Can I hold Jerry?

23:18.856 --> 23:24.195
Uhhh, sure...
just be careful.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.490
Ahhh!

23:29.700 --> 23:33.121
Oh, it's actually kinda cute.
I'm okay!

23:33.121 --> 23:34.789
Cool.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.539
Hi!

23:36.249 --> 23:39.502
Then meet mom.
-Ahhhhhh!

23:39.502 --> 23:40.462
(laughs)

23:42.130 --> 23:47.260
That's one hand-me-down
she's never gettin' rid of!
