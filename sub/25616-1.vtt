I can still help you
with your studies.

22:12.620 --> 22:17.120
Forget about studies, we need to get
rid of him! He's the one who did this!

22:17.420 --> 22:20.200
We don't really know
who burned it down.

It's not really the kind of a
thing a Straw Man does, is it?

22:24.480 --> 22:28.240
Playing with fire is pretty dangerous
when you're made of kindling.

when he first came around.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.100

who left the message?

find a way to get rid of him!

37:39.820 --> 37:42.260
Moving in one direction.
A one-way street.

37:43.360 --> 37:47.640
Think about time -
like the ocean.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.880
Take the air around us -

37:51.620 --> 37:55.500
Think of every moment and event
like a particle in the sky,

37:56.480 --> 37:58.480
moving with the wind,

37:59.000 --> 38:03.660
Clumping into clouds, condensing into rain.
Eventually falling,

38:04.600 --> 38:06.860
Joining a river, and
flowing to the sea.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.440
The sea feeds the sky,

38:11.200 --> 38:13.460
and the cycle is everywhere.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.648
We are like atoms in the
water molecules, and

38:16.660 --> 38:19.500
the whole system is
bigger and more complex

38:20.060 --> 38:22.460
than we can comprehend.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.700
You found a way to move time
from one place to another,

38:27.320 --> 38:29.320
just so you could stick
around and help me?

38:30.470 --> 38:32.179
Kind of.

38:32.180 --> 38:34.960
But like I said,
that's not important.

38:35.660 --> 38:40.456
This Devil, though, that's what's got me.
I'm going to look into this.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.320
Now, you said it was a tiger?

38:42.620 --> 38:44.620
It was wearing a tiger mask.

38:45.769 --> 38:47.769
Oh dear, that's not good.

38:50.100 --> 38:53.870
The bell - I assume you found the
book on bells at the library?

38:55.220 --> 38:57.128
You should take it to
the Pawnbroker. I bet

38:57.140 --> 38:59.060
you he'll trade you
something useful for it.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.960
I'll see you later.

39:13.020 --> 39:15.065
That bookworm told you what?

39:15.089 --> 39:18.312
Listen, I loaned you the
Spectacular Revolver as a favor

39:18.324 --> 39:21.559
to the Librarian, before
she got dead and ghosted.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.078
Look, you got nothing to
bargain with here. Ain't

39:25.090 --> 39:27.980
nothing I need in some
poor kid's pockets.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.078
Have, you ever tried to
sleep the whole night when

40:02.090 --> 40:04.280
a Straw Man's picked you
as his new best friend?

40:05.120 --> 40:08.140
"Straw Man wakes you. Then
nightmares take you."

40:09.090 --> 40:11.090
Have they started yet?

40:11.370 --> 40:13.370
The nightmares?

40:16.350 --> 40:18.403

having - the one where

40:18.415 --> 40:20.479
I watch the lights in the
skyscrapers blink out.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.948
Where buildings collapse
and the tides rise all

40:22.960 --> 40:25.340
around me. The dream
where the waters come,

40:25.860 --> 40:30.410
And take pets, and cars, and
people out into the dark.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.140
Some of them don't
even struggle.

40:33.500 --> 40:37.580
They're too tired to fight it.
They just want to let go.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.940
They just want to let go. Released
from the pain. Taken by the undertow.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.399
Taken to where the
waters recede.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.840

40:46.040 --> 40:49.400
Where sharp black rocks lead
out as far as I can see.

cracked bones.

you, you were a ghost!

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.080
A ghost?

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.858
I came here today to try and
catch the Straw Man. He

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.600
came out of the waters
today right where you did.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.740
This is the day he
first appeared.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.128
What? No, no, he's been
pestering me for months!

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.000
I was just talking to him,
he attacked me and...

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.920
And the next thing I know
I was in the river...

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.020
That's the thing Penny, he
hasn't been around. Not yet.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.220
You're obviously an older
version of yourself.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.939
Your present self?

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.036
Is in school today.
Fourteen years old, and

01:13:38.048 --> 01:13:41.156
only just now realizing
for the first time...

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:45.960
that she's tuned in to a different
wavelength than anyone else.

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:50.720
Are you, saying the Straw
Man sent me into the past?

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.240
So it would seem.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.240
Why would he do that?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.260
Things are unfolding
differently!

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.120
In my history -

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.580
He was the one who was supposed
to come out of the waters today.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.339
Wait...

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.660
Wait so that girl who almost drowned
in the river a few years, ago...

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.519
Was that girl me?

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.359
Whatever are you
up to Straw Man?

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.916
It was so weird. It was just like so much
fun. Oh my gosh I can't even explain...

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.180
Oh my god, what is going on?
What the heck is happening?

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.840
Wait, you were chasing him
even before you met me?

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.899
Penny.

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.578
I was eighteen years old when
he sent me back. I have been

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:43.280
waiting for this moment longer
than I ever thought I could.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.720
And all you got was me.

01:14:46.579 --> 01:14:48.579
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.160
I never told you my name, did I?

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.320
No.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:57.979
I asked you, after you were ghosted.
You said it wasn't important.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.680
There's something you should probably know,
Penny, if you haven't puzzled it out yet.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.860
The Straw Man is
out to get me too.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.280
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.960
My name is Penelope Palabras.

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.580

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.859

Because he's stronger than

send me here just a few hours ago.
