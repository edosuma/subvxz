WEBVTT

00:11.924 --> 00:13.187
I don't think new posters
are gonna cut it.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.405
What?

00:14.449 --> 00:16.364
You're gonna need to
up your campaign game.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.585
Well, perhaps my campaign
manager has some ideas.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.413
You mean besides
all the e-mails I sent you?

00:23.501 --> 00:24.981
I should
probably read those.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.288
Nolan,
Lopez needs a unit

00:27.331 --> 00:28.680
to accompany her this morning,
and that's you.

00:28.724 --> 00:29.290
Yes, sir.
My pleasure.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.813
Uh, sir --

00:30.856 --> 00:33.163
Can I count on your vote?

00:33.207 --> 00:35.296
I'm still doing my due diligence
with the candidates.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.994
It's Smitty!

00:38.038 --> 00:38.995
You got my vote.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.692
- Thank you.
- Not mine.

00:40.736 --> 00:41.911
I'm not in
the union yet.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.608
Right.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.486
Looks like we're gonna be
riding together.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.142
Everything good?
Uh, yeah.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.231
We have to interview one of
these Sovereign Citizen idiots.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.146
He allegedly assaulted
an IRS agent

00:59.189 --> 01:01.887
who had a few questions
about why Marvin Reynolds

01:01.931 --> 01:03.498
wasn't paying
any of his taxes.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.890
Angela, I thought we were gonna
talk more this morning.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.109
I woke up,
you were gone.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.241
Yeah, I have a job,
remember?

01:07.284 --> 01:08.590
Uh...

01:08.633 --> 01:09.504
I'll wait for you
by the shop.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.419
I'm right behind you.

01:11.462 --> 01:12.681
Angela.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.510
I don't have time
for this conversation right now.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.816
How many times
can I apologize?

01:17.860 --> 01:20.906
I told you,
I didn't have a choice.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.604
Look, making a deal
with Elijah

01:22.647 --> 01:24.475
was the only way that I could
get you home safe.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.564
I understand why you did
what you did.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.566
I can even understand
why you kept it from me --

01:28.610 --> 01:30.133
you don't want to stress out
the new mom.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.135
But to tell me
I need to stay out of it

01:32.179 --> 01:33.484
after asking
for my help --

01:33.528 --> 01:35.095
Look, I didn't
mean for you --

01:36.357 --> 01:38.359
I got myself into this.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.143
No, you got <i>us
into this,</i>

01:40.187 --> 01:41.362
and I'm going to
get <i>us</i> out.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.928
Well, how do you plan
to do that?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.887
By telling Elijah Stone you
don't work for him anymore.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.236
And if he's got
a problem with that,

01:46.280 --> 01:47.498
me and a couple hundred
of my closest friends --

01:47.542 --> 01:49.326
No, you can't.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.154
He has leverage on me.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.635
He could take it
to the state bar.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.027
I could lose
my license.

01:55.071 --> 01:57.508
Last night, you swore
you didn't break any laws.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.335
I haven't.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.991
There could be
some ethical questions.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.037
I can't do this
right now.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.170
We'll talk tonight.

02:10.608 --> 02:11.914
He can't really believe

02:11.957 --> 02:13.568
he can buy votes
with water bottles.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.265
I mean, not when I have
a real message,

02:15.309 --> 02:16.440
a message of change.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.963
Actually,
he's beating you.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.226
I did some polling,

02:19.269 --> 02:21.141
and you are
definitely behind.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.751
I'm losing to Smitty?

02:22.794 --> 02:23.969
Oh,
that's embarrassing.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.536
You know what would
really help?

02:25.580 --> 02:27.712
An endorsement from someone
respected within the department.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.586
No, don't drag me
into this.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.849
No, I have never endorsed
a candidate, and I never will.

02:33.892 --> 02:35.111
Voting is a private matter.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.637
Here, maybe this will help
wash away the taste of defeat.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.986
This bottle's
been opened.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.119
Oh, those bottles
are recyclable.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.816
It's just my way of giving back
to the environment.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.122
Where's the water from?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.254
My bathroom sink.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.821
Water's water.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.737
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

02:52.781 --> 02:55.305
♪ I'm gonna win for you

02:55.349 --> 02:59.179
♪ Like I know
you want me to do, hey ♪

03:00.702 --> 03:02.312
Everything okay
with you and Wesley?

03:02.356 --> 03:03.313
No.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.793
I get it.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.056
Sarah wanted to divorce me
at least three times

03:07.099 --> 03:08.666
during Henry's
first year.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.581
It felt like I couldn't
get anything right.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.148
It's rough,
those early days.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.064
You know, it's a lack of sleep,
it's fear of the unknown,

03:15.107 --> 03:16.326
a baby that
won't stop crying ---

03:16.370 --> 03:18.023
It's not about that.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.417
What is it about?

03:20.461 --> 03:22.463
Right now, it's about you
not minding your own business.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.639
Put the shop in drive
and let's go.

03:24.682 --> 03:25.944
I will have to
put it in reverse

03:25.988 --> 03:27.685
before I can
actually put it --

03:27.729 --> 03:29.600
I know that look.
No more jokes.

03:36.303 --> 03:36.999
Genny.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.609
Sergeant Bradford.

03:40.698 --> 03:41.917
You look skinny.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.918
Have you been eating?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.659
Every day.
Uh-huh.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.400
This is a restricted area.
How'd you get in here?

03:46.443 --> 03:48.619
Oh, the guy who's
handing out waters let me in.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.143
Okay. Yeah.
Don't drink that.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.015
Um...

03:53.058 --> 03:54.103
So, what are you
doing here?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.236
I just wanted to
see my big brother.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.847
Oh, hi.
I'm Lucy Chen.

03:58.890 --> 03:59.978
I know that
we just met,

04:00.022 --> 04:01.110
but if you have
any embarrassing stories

04:01.153 --> 04:02.938
from his childhood,
that --

04:05.941 --> 04:07.551
So you just
wanted to see me?

04:07.595 --> 04:09.292
I didn't even know
you were in town.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.902
So you're not just not
returning my calls,

04:10.946 --> 04:11.903
you're also ignoring
the messages

04:11.947 --> 04:12.991
telling you
I'm coming to town.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.254
Because I know
why you're here,

04:14.297 --> 04:15.864
and I've made
my position very clear.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.303
We have to
talk about it.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.391
Look, I gotta
get to work.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.350
Maybe we can
have dinner tonight.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.308
So you can
blow me off at the last minute?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.702
No.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.966
Why don't I do one of those
ride-along thingies?

04:31.009 --> 04:32.576
That way, we could have
the whole day to catch up.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.317
Yeah.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.710
See, you gotta get permission
to do a ride-along.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.146
It's --

04:37.189 --> 04:38.408
It's a long process,
a ton of paperwork.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.409
Hey, you're
a sergeant now.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.932
You can just
approve it yourself.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.369
Great.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.327
Let's hit the streets.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.197
Let's.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.114
Did Tim have any, um,

04:49.158 --> 04:50.246
nicknames when he was a kid?

04:57.819 --> 05:00.038
So, it's been
six weeks.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.302
Any thoughts
on my progress?

05:02.345 --> 05:04.129
I write an evaluation
every day.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.219
Those are my thoughts
on your progress.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.873
Right, I mean,
that's the technical stuff,

05:08.917 --> 05:10.310
but I was just
wondering, like,

05:10.353 --> 05:11.963
what you thought of me
as a person.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.880
What matters is what
I think about you as a cop.

05:15.924 --> 05:19.319
You want people to like you,
go make some friends.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.281
Harper.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.198
What?

05:29.241 --> 05:30.417
Oh, no, no.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.679
This is the first
I'm hearing about this.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.595
He can't do that,
though, right?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.860
Maybe?
W-What do you mean maybe?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.078
You --
You are the lawyer.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.167
Shouldn't you know that
for sure?

05:42.211 --> 05:43.691
Okay, well,
I-I'ma need you

05:43.734 --> 05:45.519
to get some damn clarity
and call me back.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.566
Is everything okay?
No.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.397
My ex-husband
is getting married,

05:54.441 --> 05:56.268
and he wants to move
to San Francisco

05:56.312 --> 05:57.792
and take my daughter
with him.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.316
Can he do that?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.405
I don't know.

06:02.449 --> 06:05.887
This is Detective Angela Lopez,
badge number 1777.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.933
I need complete histories,
statewide and CJIC,

06:08.977 --> 06:10.413
for the personal
file numbers --

06:10.457 --> 06:15.940
NWC-057, JPA-733,
BXR-389.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.203
And if any of those queries
generate other file numbers,

06:18.247 --> 06:19.422
can I get completes
on those, too?

06:19.466 --> 06:21.119
Thanks.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.992
What was that about?

06:24.035 --> 06:25.820
Uh, another case
I'm working on.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.517
Anything I can help with?

06:27.561 --> 06:29.737
No, I got it handled.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.217
Oh, yeah, he tried to highlight
his hair right before prom.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.045
He ended up
looking like Slim Shady.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.438
Hm!
Oh, you know what?

06:35.482 --> 06:36.700
I think I have a picture of it.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.399
Oh, my God, yes!
Genny.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.357
What, you'd -- you'd rather
I keep this photo private?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.752
That's fine.
Let's talk about dad.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.275
I have nothing to say.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.972
Okay.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.278
What's your cellphone number?
I'll text it to you.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.933
Genny, come on. We don't
need your distractions.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.369
Police work
is serious stuff.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.722
Ooh, boy.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.911
Hey, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to pull over.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.696
You'll never catch me!

07:15.739 --> 07:17.567
Have you been
drinking?

07:17.611 --> 07:20.744
It's not illegal
to drink and bike.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.224
Actually, it is.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.008
The way you were swerving
in and out of traffic --

07:24.052 --> 07:26.054
Oh. Uh...

07:26.097 --> 07:27.882
You could have caused
an accident. Alright?

07:27.925 --> 07:30.580
I just wanna get some tacos!

07:30.624 --> 07:33.365
Don't be such a butt.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.498
Okay, ma'am, we can cite you
for public intoxication,

07:35.542 --> 07:38.370
or if you don't cooperate,
we'll charge you with a DUI.

07:38.414 --> 07:43.680
Screw you, you
Ken-doll-ass-looking mimbo --

07:43.724 --> 07:44.986
Hey, honey.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.378
Honey, I know
you're having a bad day,

07:46.422 --> 07:47.554
but that doesn't give you
the right to be rude.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.643
They're just doing
their jobs.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.166
Why don't you take
a few deep breaths

07:51.209 --> 07:52.080
and sit down
for a minute?

07:54.952 --> 07:57.302
I'm sorry.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.785
That was impressive.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.221
I teach
fourth graders.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.618
Oh, great.

08:09.227 --> 08:12.100
Okay, look, you cannot move
our daughter to San Francisco.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.318
What -- What --
What are we gonna do?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.451
Put her on a plane
every weekend?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.496
Enroll her
in two schools?

08:16.539 --> 08:18.019
No, obviously not.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.195
What you are asking for
is near total custody

08:20.238 --> 08:22.545
and I see her on weekends
and holidays, which --

08:22.589 --> 08:26.114
which is a violation of our
custody agreement, by the way,

08:26.157 --> 08:28.420
so I --
I'm gonna need -

08:28.464 --> 08:30.248
<i>If you're satisfied with
your message, press one.</i>

08:30.292 --> 08:31.815
<i>If you'd like to
re-record, pre--</i>

08:34.078 --> 08:36.341
Look, I know he's
your daughter's father,

08:36.385 --> 08:38.605
but that man is a coward
for springing this on you.

08:40.868 --> 08:44.828
Well, he might have
left a message last week

08:44.872 --> 08:47.570
saying that he needed to talk
to me about something, but --

08:47.614 --> 08:50.051
Maybe it was two messages.

08:50.094 --> 08:53.228
There might have been
an e-mail. But...

08:53.271 --> 08:54.621
Okay. Then, why didn't you
call him back?

08:54.664 --> 08:56.797
I don't know. I thought
it was about something else.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.189
Oh, so you were
avoiding him?

08:58.233 --> 09:00.148
No, I was n--

09:00.191 --> 09:02.063
I don't know. Maybe.

09:02.106 --> 09:05.457
I did-- I didn't want to
have to talk about...

09:05.501 --> 09:06.633
Halloween.

09:07.721 --> 09:08.983
What happened
on Halloween?

09:11.246 --> 09:12.726
Ohhh.
Mm.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.424
Sorry.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.295
Well, we're about to land
at Marvin Reynolds' place.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.601
What are we
hoping for?

09:18.645 --> 09:20.516
Ideally, he admits to
assaulting the IRS agent

09:20.560 --> 09:21.604
and we hook him up.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.127
Otherwise, it's just
a misdemeanor

09:23.171 --> 09:25.477
not committed
in police presence.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.219
His word against
the IRS agent's.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.004
Yeah, I always mix up these
Sovereign Citizen guys

09:30.047 --> 09:32.615
with the
Posse Comitatus group.

09:32.659 --> 09:33.964
They're all just part of

09:34.008 --> 09:36.619
the same crazy,
anti-government soup --

09:36.663 --> 09:39.535
all just looking for their way
not to pay their fair share.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.276
I think there's a little
more to it than that.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.973
Good for you.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.671
Look, there's always
people in society

09:44.714 --> 09:46.847
who feel like
they're on the outside.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.110
And some are
easily manipulated.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.547
Some are so desperate
to find a purpose

09:51.591 --> 09:53.505
that they allow themselves
to be infected

09:53.549 --> 09:55.203
by the most absurd
beliefs,

09:55.246 --> 09:56.813
so much so,
they could rationalize

09:56.857 --> 09:58.510
beating up
an IRS agent --

09:58.554 --> 09:59.903
or worse.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.123
Nah.
My theory's better.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.516
These whack jobs just believe
they're above the law,

10:04.560 --> 10:05.605
until they need it.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.956
There it is.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.709
This guy have
a history of violence?

10:22.752 --> 10:25.015
Why do you think
I'm putting on a vest?

10:25.059 --> 10:27.931
Let me guess.
Domestic abuse?

10:27.975 --> 10:29.977
Among other things,
but he never did any time.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.551
Hey, get the hell off
of my property!

10:39.595 --> 10:42.337
Sir, I'm Detective Lopez,
and this is Officer Nolan.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.643
Are you
Marvin Reynolds?

10:43.686 --> 10:45.470
You know what?
That name is a straw-man, okay?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.647
I'm a free man,
I'm living upon the land.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.474
You're representatives of
a corporate government.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.085
You have no authority
over me.

10:51.128 --> 10:54.175
I am not a citizen of
your corporation!

10:54.218 --> 10:56.090
Sir, a complaint's been
filed against you

10:56.133 --> 10:58.440
claiming you assaulted
a federal employee from the IRS.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.702
Yeah, they're trying to
take my house.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.095
Okay?

11:01.138 --> 11:02.836
But, see, there's no
legitimate money,

11:02.879 --> 11:05.273
because we went off
the gold standard in 1933.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.101
So you're admitting
to the assault?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.539
No, I admit nothing, okay?

11:10.582 --> 11:12.106
And I don't -- I don't --
I don't have any obligation

11:12.149 --> 11:14.325
to submit
to your unlawful inquiry.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.936
Sir, we need to talk to you
about what happened.

11:15.979 --> 11:17.546
Can you please step out
onto the porch?

11:17.589 --> 11:20.027
I'm a constitutional activist,
okay?

11:20.070 --> 11:21.811
I know my rights.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.596
A-A-And what you're
practicing here, it's tyranny.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.990
Sir, we just want
your side of the story.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.036
I promise you, this will be
much more productive

11:29.079 --> 11:30.559
if you just step out
onto the porch.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.256
Ah.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.216
Yeah, that's --
that's not gonna happen.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.260
Okay?

11:36.304 --> 11:39.699
So get off of my property.
Now.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.703
Sir, take it easy.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.313
Don't do anything stupid.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.883
Sir?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.406
Gun!
Move, move, move!

11:54.801 --> 11:56.237
[ Radio chirps ]7-Adam-15.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.109
Shots fired at our location.
Send backup, Code 3.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.590
You ready?
Yeah.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.549
He's going outside.
He's running.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.961
No!

12:29.357 --> 12:31.359
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Code 3 traffic.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.796
We just got 246'd
by a submachine gun.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.842
Suspect vehicle --
silver sedan,

12:35.885 --> 12:37.495
last seen headed west
on Oakwood.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.627
Suspect still armed.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.328
Air Three
is lifting now.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.548
I'm ten-nine-seven.
Searching for suspect's vehicle.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.857
Control, 7-Adam-100
on scene.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.297
Stay in the car.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.777
Anybody hurt?

12:57.820 --> 12:59.517
We're good, but we've got
one shooter outstanding --

12:59.561 --> 13:00.910
Marvin Reynolds.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.390
Suspect vehicle --
silver sedan.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.218
Did not get very good I.D.
I didn't get any plates.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.436
Alright, let's pull
DMV records,

13:05.480 --> 13:06.960
see what Marvin's
got registered.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.962
Got to find everything
- we can about this guy.
- On it.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.311
I'll ask for
a telephonic warrant

13:10.354 --> 13:11.747
to search the GPS of
his vehicle on his phone.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.053
If we can see where he's been,

13:13.096 --> 13:14.228
it might help us know
where he's going.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.056
Control, 7-Adam-100,
advise crime scene

13:16.099 --> 13:17.709
they can begin processing
and start a board-up crew.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.277
And I need all available units
for a city-wide manhunt.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.063
Alright, listen up --
at approximately 1057 hours,

13:23.106 --> 13:24.760
suspect Marvin Reynolds
opened fire

13:24.804 --> 13:26.066
on Officer Nolan
and Detective Lopez

13:26.109 --> 13:27.241
with a submachine gun.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.590
We're dealing with
a Sovereign Citizen

13:28.633 --> 13:30.070
who's clearly snapped.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.028
He assaulted an IRS agent
who showed up two days ago

13:32.072 --> 13:33.682
to start foreclosure
proceedings.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.292
We're gonna hit up
every known address,

13:35.336 --> 13:37.425
every relative's address,
every associate,

13:37.468 --> 13:39.079
every friend of a friend
of a friend

13:39.122 --> 13:40.907
until someone
coughs this guy up.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.387
Okay, he hasn't renewed
any of his registrations
in over four years,

13:43.431 --> 13:45.607
but I got a list of everything
he's owned going back to 2005.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.478
You got a silver Honda
on there or a Toyota?

13:47.522 --> 13:49.350
There's a silver Civic,
as well as three other vehicles.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.438
Alright, send that list
to everyone's boxes.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.439
Make sure
you keep checking.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.397
This is a very fluid
situation.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.269
Now let's go get this guy
before he does something worse.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.227
Phew.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.838
What's going on?

13:58.881 --> 13:59.882
I'm taking you
back to the station.
It's too dangerous.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.318
Forget it.
- Genny.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.538
I'm not leaving until
we talk about dad.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.800
Oh, you are impossible.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.671
<i>I'm</i> impossible?

14:06.715 --> 14:08.282
Lucy, who's more difficult,
me or Tim?

14:08.325 --> 14:10.153
Of course
she's gonna pick me!

14:10.197 --> 14:11.633
Because you are the most
stubborn person alive,

14:11.676 --> 14:13.200
which is, by the way,
why you're still single.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.941
Okay.
First of all, I'm not.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.333
And second --
Wait. What?

14:16.377 --> 14:18.509
- You're seeing someone?
- This is insane.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.468
There is an armed and dangerous
suspect at large.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.426
We gotta focus.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.782
Are you okay?

14:30.826 --> 14:32.523
I'm fine.
I've been shot at before.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.134
That's not what
I'm talking about.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.613
Something else
is going on here,

14:35.657 --> 14:37.964
and maybe a friendly ear
will help.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.794
Wesley made a deal
with Elijah Stone

14:42.838 --> 14:45.319
to find out where La Fiera
was keeping me in Guatemala,

14:45.362 --> 14:47.843
and now Elijah is
threatening our family.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.196
What do we do?

14:53.240 --> 14:55.285
Thank you, but I'm trying to
figure that out.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.896
Well, it doesn't seem
that complicated.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.420
He's a criminal,
and you're a cop.

14:59.463 --> 15:02.727
There's an element I can't talk
about, but it muddies things.

15:02.771 --> 15:06.514
Well, for what it's worth,

15:06.557 --> 15:09.386
I have never met a couple
so different from each other

15:09.430 --> 15:11.649
and yet so perfect
for one another.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.608
I can't imagine what it is
you're facing,

15:13.651 --> 15:15.610
but I do know this --

15:15.653 --> 15:18.221
the only way you're gonna
get through it is together.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.879
Pull over.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.141
You gonna throw up?

15:25.185 --> 15:26.273
Was that a little
too saccharine?

15:26.316 --> 15:28.014
A little,
but I need to make a call.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.103
I've been known to
keep a secret.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.408
I need to make a call,

15:31.452 --> 15:32.932
and unless you want to
be subpoenaed one day,

15:32.975 --> 15:34.672
you can't hear any of it,
so pull over.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.457
Roger that.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.645
Hey, it's me.

15:50.688 --> 15:51.733
Hey.
Are we okay?

15:51.776 --> 15:52.690
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

15:52.734 --> 15:53.996
I've been digging

15:54.040 --> 15:55.824
into everything I can find
about Elijah,

15:55.867 --> 15:57.043
and I think I have a plan.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.175
We're going to build
a RICO case against him

15:59.219 --> 16:01.308
and make sure
he rots in jail,

16:01.351 --> 16:04.093
which means I need you to
document every interaction

16:04.137 --> 16:05.225
you've ever had
with Elijah --

16:05.268 --> 16:07.314
every threat
or implied threat,

16:07.357 --> 16:09.011
admission to his own crimes

16:09.055 --> 16:10.404
or the crimes of
his criminal enterprise.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.101
No, I can't.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.973
That violates
attorney-client privilege.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.757
Are you serious?
I know.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.889
He threatened
your wife and baby.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.717
The privilege belongs
to the client.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.023
It's not my privilege
to waive.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.546
You made a vow.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.808
What's more important,

16:23.852 --> 16:25.680
your vow to your client
or to me?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.990
Oh, up on the right --
silver one.

16:31.033 --> 16:34.123
No, wrong make
and model.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.212
Any other plans
while you're in L.A.?

16:36.256 --> 16:38.867
I have to sell our dad's house.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.521
He hasn't been able to live
on his own for awhile.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.349
Oh. I'm sorry.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.829
Thanks. It's a mess.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.092
It's a lot of work
for one person.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.702
Well, I'm sure
Tim will help.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.051
What's the point?
It's a teardown.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.053
Just sell it
and be done with it.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.533
It's got good bones.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.317
We could make some money
if we put in a little effort.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.841
You watch a couple hours of HGTV
and now you're an expert?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.452
Wait, what is
your favorite show?

16:58.495 --> 16:59.975
Mine is "House Hunters
International."

17:00.019 --> 17:01.890
Oh, my God. The best.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.674
Nolan, can you 10-3
to another channel?

17:03.718 --> 17:05.763
Roger that.
Going to 6.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.114
Yeah, look, my sister needs
to sell my dad's house,

17:08.157 --> 17:09.245
<i>but it hasn't been
updated or repaired</i>

17:09.289 --> 17:10.942
<i>since it was built
in 1958.</i>

17:10.986 --> 17:12.466
What are the inspections
gonna reveal?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.468
Uh, 1958?

17:14.511 --> 17:16.731
It's probably got old
cloth-insulated wiring

17:16.774 --> 17:18.167
that would need to
be replaced.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.213
Uh, the plumbing would
need to be updated.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.215
<i>The cast-iron sewer
could be cracked</i>

17:22.258 --> 17:23.564
or rusted through
in places,

17:23.607 --> 17:25.305
and the foundations
would need to be checked.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.741
So it's a teardown.

17:26.784 --> 17:27.916
<i>Oh, no,
not necessarily.</i>

17:27.959 --> 17:29.135
If it has good bones,

17:29.178 --> 17:30.440
some simple repairs
and updates

17:30.484 --> 17:32.834
<i>would double the value
of your house.</i>

17:32.877 --> 17:33.878
I'm happy to swing by,
take a look at it,

17:33.922 --> 17:35.228
see what needs
to be done.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.360
Alright, you will all
have to wait your turn.

17:37.404 --> 17:41.538
Nolan is busy helping me install
my new kitchen backsplash.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.062
Right, but after that.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.454
Kind of regretting
telling everyone

17:44.498 --> 17:46.108
you used to be a contractor,
aren't you?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.805
<i>Hey, Nolan,
do you do pergolas?</i>

17:47.849 --> 17:50.112
'Cause my outdoor space
is really underused.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.158
Landscaping's not really
my area of expertise,

17:52.201 --> 17:54.116
but I have built
a gazebo or two in my day.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.162
Hold on. We just
got sent a location

17:56.205 --> 17:58.338
of one of Marvin Reynolds'
vehicles.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.991
Looks like he's got an RV

18:00.035 --> 18:01.471
that's been collecting
parking tickets

18:01.515 --> 18:03.604
on the 1600 block
of Crenshaw.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.996
We're closest.
We'll -- We'll take it.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.824
Heading there now.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.832
Is that from
your lawyer?

18:14.876 --> 18:15.964
Uh, yeah.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.097
It's about
three pages of legalese

18:18.140 --> 18:20.577
that basically comes down to,
I am screwed.

18:20.621 --> 18:21.578
Yeah, but
you're the mom.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
I mean,
that has to matter.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.408
Yeah, I'm the mom who all
but abandoned her daughter

18:25.452 --> 18:27.845
when I went undercover
and then nearly got her killed.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.673
Donovan is the one
who was there for her.

18:29.717 --> 18:30.892
Okay, but that
was the past.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.329
Look, I've seen you,
okay?

18:33.373 --> 18:34.983
You're a great mom.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.464
Would a great mom put her kid
through a second custody battle?

18:37.507 --> 18:39.422
I mean, last time
was a nightmare.

18:39.466 --> 18:42.164
She had trouble sleeping.
Her school work suffered.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.558
I just -- I don't know
if I can do that again.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.081
There's our RV.
Alright.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.127
Be ready to bail in case
he opens fire on us.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.345
Got that.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.502
Yeah, VIN matches.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.678
This is our guy's.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.636
Looks abandoned, but it don't
mean he ain't held up inside.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.554
Alright.
What's the play, Boot?

19:24.598 --> 19:26.295
Well, there's only
one entry point,

19:26.339 --> 19:28.993
so we stay safe
and, uh, try to see

19:29.037 --> 19:30.473
if we can get him to come out
with verbal commands.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.780
And if there's
no response?

19:32.823 --> 19:33.955
Breach?

19:33.998 --> 19:35.348
Or...

19:44.487 --> 19:45.793
Ball-Cam.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.404
360-degree view.
It can even swim.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.407
I am in no mood to play games
with this guy.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.843
We just have to
get it inside.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.258
Man.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.739
This guy
is ready for war.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.828
- So, are we going in?
- Hold on. One sec.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.046
I gotta
check the door,

20:22.090 --> 20:24.223
make sure it's not rigged
with explosives.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.789
Yeah, he definitely
seems like the type.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.530
Alright,
I don't see any wires.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.315
We're all clear.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.984
Alright.
We're all clear.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.596
Control, 7-Adam-07,
we're code 4.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.510
RV is unoccupied.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.775
"Rebirth through
the blood of innocents."

20:54.818 --> 20:56.211
Looks like we got ourselves
a manifesto.

21:00.433 --> 21:03.392
Control, Air Three is moving
over to the northeast grid.

21:03.436 --> 21:04.828
<i>Copy, Air Three.</i>

21:06.961 --> 21:08.310
Listen to this --

21:08.354 --> 21:12.488
"Satanic-Hebrew Anglo-Commerce
devoured America."

21:12.532 --> 21:14.534
"The Cabal's slaves
have vanquished us.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.275
Your blood flows
gutter-rivers today."

21:16.318 --> 21:18.320
"The time is at hand
for renewal,

21:18.364 --> 21:20.670
and we will use
the blood of the masters

21:20.714 --> 21:23.456
to wash away
the incestuous sins

21:23.499 --> 21:25.762
of the corrupt
adjudicators."

21:25.806 --> 21:28.287
Barely literate
and yet truly terrifying.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.811
The good news is, we found
the RV with his stash of guns

21:30.854 --> 21:31.986
before he could
get to them.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.553
Even if all he has
is a submachine gun,

21:33.596 --> 21:35.729
we're still looking at a
potential mass-casualty event.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.687
He post anything
to social media?

21:37.731 --> 21:40.951
Nothing new. A dozen older
posts, tilting at windmills.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.910
But he's only got
like 10 followers.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.825
Not sure how wide
his message spread.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.609
Maybe he's using a secret
platform, like 9-Chan?

21:46.653 --> 21:47.958
Forensics is on that.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.919
Got a name
and work address

21:51.962 --> 21:53.703
of a former girlfriend --
Erica Lawrence.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.357
Multiple domestic calls
to her home

21:55.401 --> 21:56.532
when they were together.

21:56.576 --> 21:57.577
Grey wants us
to interview her.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.492
Right.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.844
I think that's her.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.194
Yeah.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.151
That should be her.

22:08.762 --> 22:09.719
Ms. Lawrence?

22:09.763 --> 22:11.068
Yes?

22:11.112 --> 22:13.593
I'm Detective Lopez.
This is Officer Nolan.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.117
Can you tell us the last time
you saw Marvin Reynolds?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.988
What'd he do?

22:18.032 --> 22:19.860
Shot at us,
for starters.

22:19.903 --> 22:20.991
Have you seen him?

22:21.035 --> 22:24.081
Not since last month.

22:24.125 --> 22:27.041
I started dating someone,
and he found out.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.738
I was so careful
about posting anything,

22:28.782 --> 22:30.305
but somehow, he knew.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.568
What happened?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.178
He came over drunk.

22:34.222 --> 22:37.225
He insisted on playing
Russian Roulette.

22:37.268 --> 22:40.228
He said that
if I deserved to live, that...

22:40.271 --> 22:42.273
fate would save me.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.797
H-He pulled the trigger
three times

22:43.840 --> 22:45.755
before my brother came
and scared him off.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.844
I'm so sorry.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.543
And you didn't file
a restraining order?

22:50.586 --> 22:53.023
I was too scared.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.417
I just want him
to forget I exist.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
But now, do y--

22:57.463 --> 22:59.943
do you think that
he would come for me?

22:59.987 --> 23:01.380
We won't let him.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.033
I'll have a unit come
take you to the station

23:03.077 --> 23:04.600
and wait
until we catch him.

23:04.644 --> 23:05.819
Is there anything
you can tell us

23:05.862 --> 23:07.473
that might help us do that?

23:07.516 --> 23:09.039
Um...

23:09.083 --> 23:11.825
He used to boast
that he had weapons

23:11.868 --> 23:13.130
stashed all over the city,

23:13.174 --> 23:14.654
but he never said where.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.569
What was he gonna
use them for?

23:16.612 --> 23:18.397
Killing people.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.922
But I-I don't know
who, exactly.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.445
He wasn't always like this.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.579
When I first met him,
he was intense and a bit quiet,

23:26.622 --> 23:27.971
but he wasn't radicalized.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.582
Well, what changed?

23:29.625 --> 23:32.802
He met this guy online --
Cooper.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.805
He's the one who pulled him
into the Sovereign Citizens.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.286
Any idea where
we can find Cooper?

23:38.329 --> 23:40.288
You know, you'd think
after the seventh time

23:40.331 --> 23:42.116
this guy posted about
overthrowing the government,

23:42.159 --> 23:43.596
someone might have
called us.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.990
Yeah, it's free speech,
so there's not much we can do.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.470
Donovan call you back?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.080
Nope.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.212
Look, I know
you don't want to put Lila

23:51.255 --> 23:52.648
through any more of this
custody stuff,

23:52.692 --> 23:54.389
but you're not the one
who's doing this.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.477
You know that, right?

23:55.521 --> 23:57.000
He is.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.437
He's the one who decided
to move.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.265
Yeah.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.398
But?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.227
I-I mean, who am I
to say that he can't?

24:06.270 --> 24:08.534
E-Especially after
everything that I did.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.493
Okay, you know what?

24:11.537 --> 24:12.929
Maybe I'm wrong,

24:12.973 --> 24:15.454
and maybe I'm bringing
my own experience into this,

24:15.497 --> 24:18.326
but I still think
you're punishing yourself.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.241
Yeah, like, y-y-you got this
narrative going right now

24:20.284 --> 24:23.462
where he's the saint
and you're some screw-up.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.898
And you know what?
I-I don't know.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.248
I wasn't there,
a-and maybe you were terrible.

24:27.291 --> 24:30.207
But right now,
he's trying to take your kid,

24:30.251 --> 24:31.470
and you're just
letting him do it

24:31.513 --> 24:32.688
because you're so eaten up
with guilt.

24:32.732 --> 24:33.776
Like...

24:38.128 --> 24:40.696
Cooper Sanford?
I'm Detective Lopez.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.089
This is Officer Nolan.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.438
We're looking
for a friend of yours --

24:43.482 --> 24:44.831
Marvin Reynolds.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.136
Doesn't ring a bell.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.268
See, now,
that's a dumb thing to say,

24:47.311 --> 24:49.139
because clearly, it does.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.706
We heard that you sold him
thousands of dollars' worth

24:50.750 --> 24:52.186
of Sovereign Citizen kits.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.364
- And who told you that?
- We're not
telling you that.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.974
Yeah, probably
his bitch of a girlfriend.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.410
He dumped her and moved on.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.412
Can't believe anything
that she says.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.631
So you <i>do</i> know him.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.982
I'm gonna need to see
your delegation of authority.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.506
It's right here.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.246
When was the last time you were
in contact with Marvin?

25:09.290 --> 25:11.640
I don't need to answer
any of your questions.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.642
I'm not a citizen
of your corporation.

25:13.686 --> 25:14.425
My corporation?

25:14.469 --> 25:16.210
In 1871,

25:16.253 --> 25:18.081
the United States
stopped being a country

25:18.125 --> 25:19.909
and started being a corporation.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.042
None of the laws passed
since then in any --

25:22.085 --> 25:24.523
Enough of the
Sovereign Citizen crap!

25:24.566 --> 25:26.742
You need to educate yourself!

25:26.786 --> 25:30.224
This "government" that you serve
sells us all into slavery!

25:30.267 --> 25:32.487
Marvin is planning
a terrorist act.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.402
Do you understand that?

25:34.445 --> 25:35.795
If you have
any knowledge of it,

25:35.838 --> 25:37.144
you're an accessory
after the fact,

25:37.187 --> 25:39.625
whether you believe in the law
or not.

25:39.668 --> 25:42.149
I'm not scared of you!

25:45.761 --> 25:47.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.765
I'm gonna cut him off.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.288
♪ Establishing bricks

25:54.814 --> 25:56.206
Clear it out. Go.
Move out.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.252
♪ ...in your hands

26:00.559 --> 26:01.603
Get out!

26:14.181 --> 26:15.486
Let's try this again.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.011
Where's your friend?
What's he got planned?

26:18.054 --> 26:20.622
I do not recognize
your authority.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.363
I do not answer questions.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.278
You will tell me,
or a lot of people will die.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.019
I do not recognize
your authority!

26:26.062 --> 26:28.543
I do not answer questions!

26:28.587 --> 26:29.588
I could change that.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.067
Aah!
Come on!

26:31.111 --> 26:32.460
What are you doing?

26:32.503 --> 26:33.853
I need a lawyer!

26:33.896 --> 26:35.376
See, all these guys
embrace the legal system

26:35.419 --> 26:36.333
when it serves them!

26:36.377 --> 26:37.508
You need to stop now,
Angela.

26:37.552 --> 26:38.509
Out of my way!

26:38.553 --> 26:39.946
Take a step back.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.382
I outrank you.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.166
Take a step back, ma'am.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.561
Aah.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.521
She was trying to hurt me.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.133
No. She was trying to
scare you.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.439
Now, I could charge you
right now with assault --

26:55.483 --> 26:58.225
Yeah, and I could file
a complaint for abuse.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.140
That is a stretch.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.750
Look, I am willing to
uncuff you right now.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.883
We can put this whole thing
in both our rearview mirrors,

27:03.926 --> 27:07.408
but only if you tell me
what Marvin was planning.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.410
Now, believe this --

27:09.453 --> 27:12.805
the detective
was telling the truth.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.807
If Marvin hurts someone
and you're withholding evidence,

27:14.850 --> 27:16.243
you will be charged
right alongside of him.

27:16.286 --> 27:17.984
And good luck
telling the prison guards

27:18.027 --> 27:19.681
you don't believe in
their authority.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.948
I don't know
where Marvin is.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.298
He called me
about an hour ago.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.867
He asked me to meet him,
bring my guns.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.002
I told him I was all talk
and that he was on his own.

27:37.003 --> 27:39.614
What did he say
he needed the guns for?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.704
He just said
it was go time.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.576
And that I'd probably
never see him again.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.758
Maybe I should
just let it go,

27:52.801 --> 27:54.542
but that house
was my childhood home.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.152
I don't want to
tear it down.

27:56.196 --> 27:57.110
I want another family
to live there

27:57.153 --> 27:58.372
and make happy memories.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.939
Of course.

27:59.982 --> 28:02.202
I moved out 10 years ago,
and when I think of home,

28:02.245 --> 28:03.986
I still think of
my parents' house.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.207
What's wrong?

28:08.295 --> 28:09.296
Tim?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.562
Look, I know you don't feel
the same way I do,

28:14.605 --> 28:17.043
but our childhood
wasn't all bad.

28:17.086 --> 28:18.522
Stop.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.176
Alright?

28:20.220 --> 28:22.744
Are you really getting nostalgic
over that place?

28:22.788 --> 28:24.746
What -- What do you want?
Some other family

28:24.790 --> 28:26.617
to just cuddle up
under the broken plaster

28:26.661 --> 28:28.010
where dad slammed my head
against the wall?

28:29.229 --> 28:30.621
Dad had a lot of demons.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.406
Dad was a monster.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.103
He's changed.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.062
You haven't seen him
in 20 years.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.107
The only thing
that's changed

28:38.151 --> 28:39.500
is that the drinking
caught up with him.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.806
Okay?
He can't throw a punch,

28:40.849 --> 28:42.503
but he's the same guy
underneath.

28:42.546 --> 28:45.811
He's not, and you'd know that
if you'd visit the hospice.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.334
Not in a million years.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.118
Wait, hospice?

28:49.162 --> 28:51.817
I had to move him out of
assisted living last month.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.950
Dad's dying.

29:11.314 --> 29:12.315
I know you and Wesley

29:12.359 --> 29:13.752
are going through a lot
right now,

29:13.795 --> 29:15.144
but that's no excuse.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.493
I wasn't actually
going to hurt him.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.234
It doesn't matter.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.236
We can't play "bad cop"
anymore.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.629
We have to rise above
that way of thinking

29:21.672 --> 29:22.717
because it's corrosive.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.547
You're right.
I'm sorry.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.896
Thank you.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.508
Silver Honda --
that could be Marvin's car.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.467
Plate's a match.
That's him.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.209
Control, 7-Adam-15, we have eyes
on Marvin Reynolds' vehicle.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.601
Stand by.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.352
7-Adam-100, 7-Adam-15,

29:49.396 --> 29:51.354
we've cleared the vehicle,
no sign of suspect.

29:51.398 --> 29:52.529
<i>Secure the location
and sit tight</i>

29:52.573 --> 29:53.356
<i>until TID arrives.</i>

29:53.400 --> 29:54.618
Copy that.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.447
Lopez, you see this?

29:57.491 --> 29:59.275
Oil leak.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.321
There was a big vehicle here
parked for some time.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.540
The street cleaners had to
maneuver around it.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.020
Another weapons stash?

30:05.064 --> 30:07.022
So he ditched the Civic
and drove off in an arsenal?

30:07.066 --> 30:08.284
You finally got rid of it.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.155
Rid of what?

30:09.198 --> 30:10.634
That van.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.680
I must've called a hundred times
trying to get it towed.

30:12.723 --> 30:15.726
Well, then, uh, you must
remember some details about it?

30:15.770 --> 30:16.858
Yeah.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.994
Hey, I-I know a great
bereavement counselor,

30:22.037 --> 30:23.822
if you need someone
to talk to.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.650
I have someone. Thanks.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.087
You know, therapy's really
helped me come to terms

30:28.130 --> 30:30.350
with everything that happened
to us when we were kids.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.875
It could help you, too.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.485
I'm good.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.661
You really don't think
you carry some trauma

30:37.705 --> 30:39.098
from what
he put you through?

30:39.141 --> 30:40.403
When you were 7 years old,

30:40.447 --> 30:42.014
he dropped you in Griffith Park
with a compass

30:42.057 --> 30:42.971
and made you
find your way home.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.320
Which I did.

30:44.364 --> 30:45.800
A Tim Test.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.193
A what?

30:47.236 --> 30:48.368
Nothing. Um...

30:49.978 --> 30:53.199
Oh. We got a hit on the van
that Nolan and Lopez I.D.'d.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.462
It's racked up
hundreds of dollars in fines.

30:55.505 --> 30:56.463
Parking tickets?

30:56.506 --> 30:57.594
And tolls.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.031
Where are they clustered?

30:59.074 --> 31:00.293
Uh, they're centered around
the Port of Los Angeles.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.598
Didn't the intel report
state

31:01.642 --> 31:02.686
that Marvin used to work
down there?

31:02.730 --> 31:04.079
Drove a forklift
or something?

31:04.123 --> 31:05.211
Yeah, but he was fired
two years ago.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.386
Why would he
be visiting now?

31:07.648 --> 31:09.041
I'll send some units.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.697
Air Three has eyes
on suspect vehicle.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.656
Northeast corner of lot A,
just off Front Street.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.005
I'm gonna orbit.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.834
Control, 7-Adam-15,
show us responding.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.317
Air Three, 7-Adam-07,
arriving at location.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.449
Stand by.

31:31.150 --> 31:34.327
Air Three, 7-Adam-07,
any movement?

31:36.242 --> 31:39.114
7-Adam-07, I see no movement
in suspect vehicle.

31:44.119 --> 31:47.296
Aaron, relax
and follow my lead.

32:00.744 --> 32:01.702
Front seat clear.

32:15.368 --> 32:16.630
Clear.

32:19.024 --> 32:21.678
Air Three, 7-Adam-07,
no sign of suspect,

32:21.722 --> 32:23.854
but he is
clearly well-armed.

32:23.898 --> 32:27.162
Marvin just posted something
to social media.

32:27.206 --> 32:30.818
<i>History is gonna remember
this day as Sovereigns' Day.</i>

32:30.861 --> 32:32.341
<i>I'm about to light the spark</i>

32:32.385 --> 32:34.082
<i>that's gonna ignite
the revolution.</i>

32:34.126 --> 32:36.302
Maybe we can spot something
that gives away his location.

32:36.345 --> 32:37.651
It's hard to tell.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.479
And who knows
when he recorded that.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.438
I mean, why here?

32:42.482 --> 32:44.440
Uh, there are dozens of targets
at the port,

32:44.484 --> 32:47.008
from the cruise ship terminal
to the port itself.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.228
Yeah, or maybe he's here to kill
the boss that fired him

32:49.271 --> 32:50.794
and pretend
it's for some great cause.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.016
We're taking fire!
We need to back off!

32:55.060 --> 32:57.062
Do you have a location
on the shooter?

32:57.105 --> 32:57.888
Negative, negative.

32:59.673 --> 33:00.456
Where the hell is he?

33:06.071 --> 33:07.159
Air Three,
suspect heading north

33:07.202 --> 33:09.161
along the water,
armed with a long gun.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.771
<i>We're climbing to a safe
altitude, then I'll swing back.</i>

33:10.814 --> 33:12.599
Police, stop!

33:23.349 --> 33:26.352
Control, 7-Adam-07,
alert Long Beach Police,

33:26.395 --> 33:28.049
we are taking fire.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.747
Moving to channel 13
for mutual aid.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.054
Secure that weapon.

33:44.239 --> 33:45.806
We have to stop him before
he gets on that ship.

34:08.698 --> 34:11.397
Clear!

34:11.440 --> 34:14.356
Move! Clear!
Everyone, clear!

34:14.400 --> 34:15.923
What do you got?

34:15.966 --> 34:17.229
Single shooter we've been
tracking since L.A.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.882
- Where is he?
- Somewhere on that boat.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.931
Stay here
in case he doubles back.

34:23.974 --> 34:25.367
Move, move, move!
Come, come.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.328

34:44.517 --> 34:45.953

35:06.191 --> 35:07.409
Stay calm.

35:07.453 --> 35:08.715
Keep going going this way,
exit the ship.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.499
There's other officers
waiting outside.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.074
Exit out that door.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.728
It's a straight shot outside,
okay?

35:21.771 --> 35:23.512
It's clear.
We just came from that way.

35:23.556 --> 35:24.687

Don't move!
It's okay.

35:52.933 --> 35:53.934
Whoa.
You're safe, you're safe.

35:53.977 --> 35:54.848
Please.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.023
Please get me out of here.

35:56.066 --> 35:57.372
You have to let him go
first.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.765
Okay.
- I-I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.289
What is that?

36:01.333 --> 36:02.595
You stay here.
You'll be safe, alright?

36:02.638 --> 36:03.857

About what?

37:45.219 --> 37:47.047
I need to fight for Lila.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.527
Even if I lose,
she needs to know

37:48.570 --> 37:49.745
that I would do anything
for her.

37:49.789 --> 37:50.920
You're not gonna lose.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.274
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

37:56.317 --> 38:00.190
I mean, my lawyer is
a lovely person but...

38:00.234 --> 38:02.497
Actually, that might be
the issue.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.021
She's too nice
to be a divorce lawyer.

38:05.065 --> 38:07.459
Well, then hire
someone better -- or worse.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.982
Better lawyer,
worse person.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.027
Me and whose paycheck?

38:11.071 --> 38:12.115
Use my lawyer.

38:12.159 --> 38:16.119
She is a shark,
and she owes me one.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.339
The press around my trial
tripled her business.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.210
She'll give you

38:20.254 --> 38:21.342

38:44.670 --> 38:46.541
but she lived through it

40:35.520 --> 40:37.522
I just hope it's enough
to make the case against Elijah.

40:37.565 --> 40:40.873
Listen, about today,
don't be too hard on yourself.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.049
You've been going through a lot
these past few months.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.138
Not an excuse.
I know better.

40:45.181 --> 40:47.009
I'm just glad you were there
to remind me.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.146
What are you doing here?

40:54.539 --> 40:55.931
I'm doing the right thing.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.803
Sergeant Grey came to me
last week, offered his help.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.021
Today, I finally took it.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.460
You told him everything?

41:02.503 --> 41:04.462
Everything.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.551
From the first time I approached
Elijah until today.

41:06.594 --> 41:08.248
How the hell
does that help us?

41:08.291 --> 41:09.641
Because Sergeant Grey
accepted my offer

41:09.684 --> 41:11.773
to be a cooperating witness.

41:11.817 --> 41:12.731
No, you're not doing that.

41:12.774 --> 41:13.993
That will get you killed.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.909
I've been working all day,

41:16.952 --> 41:18.258
and I think
with a little more digging,

41:18.301 --> 41:20.173
we can hang a RICO case
on Elijah.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.914
But any good lawyer
will swat that away.

41:21.957 --> 41:24.830
He will never see
a jail cell.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.440
Well, you're not
becoming a C.I.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.835
What about attorney-client
privilege?

41:29.878 --> 41:30.923
That could get you
disbarred.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.535
Some things are hard to do.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.450
Some things are scary.

41:36.494 --> 41:40.410
This is both,
but it's something I have to do.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.761
It's not for me, it's for you.
And Jack.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.547
So, look, Angela,
I've already got calls in

41:46.591 --> 41:49.811
to the State's Attorney General
and District Attorney.

41:49.855 --> 41:51.683
They already got a game plan,

41:51.726 --> 41:55.425
and I will personally oversee
how Wesley is utilized.

41:55.469 --> 41:57.515
I promise.

41:57.558 --> 41:59.865
I will do everything humanly
possible to keep him safe.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.957
I need you to tell me
this is okay.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.350
I won't do it
without your support.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.008
We can't screw this up.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.490
Not a single mistake.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.970
Not one.

42:18.013 --> 42:20.712
We won't.
I promise you.
