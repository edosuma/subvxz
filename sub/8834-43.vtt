You wouldn't fit in.

03:32.166 --> 03:34.417
Why? The doorway's too small?

03:35.041 --> 03:36.792
I give up.

I rented it for you.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.959
We're visiting an airplane, aren't we?

06:54.041 --> 06:58.291
But you can judge a man by his clothes.

06:58.375 --> 07:01.208
I kinda like being judged as a pilot.

-[Baloo] She's an aviator's dream.
-[Rebecca] Why?

07:27.750 --> 07:30.000
Because she's never been flown.

07:30.083 --> 07:34.000
She's too big to fly through the cliffs.

07:34.458 --> 07:37.667
[Rebecca] So that's why they turned her
into a nightclub.

14:00.083 --> 14:03.834
Time for a little machine failure.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.709
Hey, what's gotten into Lefty?

14:08.208 --> 14:09.875
Hey, what gives?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.834
Oh, a wise pilot.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.000
Ooh! Ow!

14:28.875 --> 14:30.792
[grunting]

14:35.041 --> 14:37.083
[alarm blaring]

14:39.333 --> 14:41.875
[engines sputter]

14:49.750 --> 14:52.041
Boss, this plane's out of control!

14:52.125 --> 14:54.083
We got what we came for. Let's bail!

15:03.542 --> 15:04.458
They're gone!

15:05.250 --> 15:06.917
With our jewelry.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.208
Is there a pilot in the house?

15:09.542 --> 15:11.291
Did I miss dessert?

15:11.375 --> 15:13.458
Baloo, there's no one's flying
the airplane!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.083
Well, relax, folks.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.875
It's the ace of the base.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.792
Old Baloo's got everything under control.

15:22.583 --> 15:26.542
Rebecca, I've always dreamed
of flying this baby.

15:30.458 --> 15:33.125
Oops! I did too good a job on the cables.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.583
Can you get us down?

15:37.667 --> 15:39.500
That's the easy part.

15:39.875 --> 15:42.250
It's staying in one piece that's hard!

15:47.166 --> 15:49.667
[screaming]

15:56.417 --> 15:58.000
[Rebecca] Do something!

15:58.333 --> 16:00.458
[groans]

16:02.917 --> 16:04.625
Look, an island!

16:04.709 --> 16:06.834
[Baloo] That ought to break our fall.

16:06.917 --> 16:08.375
[Rebecca] Steer for it!

16:08.458 --> 16:10.458
This ain't no kite!

16:21.667 --> 16:24.000
Uh. Ooh.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.500
Hey, not bad, huh?

16:26.583 --> 16:29.417
That's the first time
I've ever landed a nightclub.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.458
So, Mr. Pilot,

16:40.542 --> 16:44.583
is this what you call
having everything under control?

16:44.667 --> 16:45.458
Huh?

16:45.542 --> 16:50.291
First, you ruin our ball,
then you almost get us killed.

16:50.417 --> 16:55.583
How could you possibly think
this buffoon would fit in to our group?

16:55.667 --> 16:57.583
I... I thought--

16:57.667 --> 17:01.083
Don't worry about your tea party, lady!

17:01.166 --> 17:03.083
I'm heading for bluer skies.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.959
Good, good! Run away!

17:07.040 --> 17:08.875
We'll be safer without you.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.125
Clam up, you ungrateful old goat!

17:11.208 --> 17:13.959
[Mr. Grapple] You can't talk
to her that way.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.541
And you can stick your light bulbs
up your nose.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.791
Wake up, you weasels!

17:19.875 --> 17:21.875
That man just saved our lives.

17:21.959 --> 17:27.666
Maybe he's crude, and rough around the
edges but I'd take him over all of you.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.542
Huh! Well, good riddance!

17:35.625 --> 17:38.291
We can do jolly well without them.

17:38.375 --> 17:42.625
Now, who knows how we call a taxi?

17:42.750 --> 17:46.875
Sorry, lady, but you landed
in the wrong part of town.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.333
Small world, ain't it?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.083
[guests screaming]

17:53.166 --> 17:56.333
[machine-gun fire]

17:56.417 --> 18:00.250
All right, we're all going to go outside
and cut down some trees

18:00.333 --> 18:02.667
and build us a nice, little raft.

18:02.750 --> 18:06.750
Won't we need a big raft
for all these people?

18:06.834 --> 18:08.583
Who said anything about taking you?

18:08.667 --> 18:09.625
Move!

18:10.125 --> 18:14.333
The entertainment committee
will hear about this.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.667
[machine-gun fire]

18:22.417 --> 18:23.583
Baloo?

18:23.709 --> 18:25.375
Baloo?

18:27.625 --> 18:29.333
Baloo, is that you?

18:35.542 --> 18:37.000
Oh, Baloo.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.166
Easy, Becky. Everything's fine.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.792
No, it isn't.

18:41.875 --> 18:45.000
Owl Capone's back.
We've got to help the guests.

18:45.250 --> 18:50.166
Give me one good reason
why I should bail them out.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.959
Because you're better than them.

18:52.041 --> 18:54.875
Oh, good answer. Let's go!

18:56.208 --> 18:58.834
[Owl Capone] Hurry it up, you slugs!

19:04.917 --> 19:06.917
We can't get them up there.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.458
What can we do?

19:08.542 --> 19:09.875
Hmm...

19:12.750 --> 19:14.542
Are we calling for help?

19:15.250 --> 19:17.083
The radio's busted.

19:17.291 --> 19:21.333
We'll give those feather-brained hoods
a ride instead.

19:21.417 --> 19:23.333
Uh! Ooh!

19:25.083 --> 19:27.583
Ow!

19:30.917 --> 19:33.709
Oh, who did this?

19:33.792 --> 19:37.208
Just your average party-wrecking buffoon.

19:40.667 --> 19:44.500
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you, Mr. Baloo.

19:44.583 --> 19:50.333
We may be wealthy,
but we couldn't change a flat tire.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.542
We need your help. Please!

19:52.625 --> 19:54.667
OK, I'll help you,

19:54.875 --> 19:56.500
but on one condition.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.875
You do exactly as I say.
No questions asked.

20:03.041 --> 20:05.417
Some of you gather up anything that burns.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.000
Another group, find some tools.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.709
The rest of you,
go find needles and thread.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.583
Baloo, I'm proud of you.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.500
Oh, and one more thing.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.750
Take off your clothes!

20:17.834 --> 20:20.917
-hh!
-What?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.208
I take it all back.

20:23.709 --> 20:26.041
On the double, Beckers!

20:36.375 --> 20:38.208
[sawing]

21:00.291 --> 21:02.417
Baloo Airlines flight double or nothing

21:02.500 --> 21:05.333
is ready for boarding.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.709
Hip, hip, hooray!

21:28.709 --> 21:31.208
[jazz music playing]

21:31.291 --> 21:35.417
Mr. Baloo, for an ill-mannered slob,

21:35.750 --> 21:38.000
you're really a swell guy.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.083
I'm just a pilot doing his job.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.959
Nothing else.

21:43.041 --> 21:48.041
I'd still like you to consider
shipping our light bulbs,

21:48.417 --> 21:51.083
those I haven't shoved up my nose.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.041
Bright idea.
