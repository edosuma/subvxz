WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.421
*

00:07.840 --> 00:12.174
* I got today,
and that's all I want *

00:12.210 --> 00:16.146
* I got my friends and my
records and a couple of bucks *

00:16.180 --> 00:18.068
* Got a smile on my face

00:18.110 --> 00:21.113
* That's more than enough
for me... *

00:23.150 --> 00:24.344
(music continues faintly
through earbuds)

00:36.870 --> 00:40.237
* It must be the way
you rush right through me... *

00:40.270 --> 00:42.204
WOMAN:
Here are Kafka's drops.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.662
She needs them
In 15 minutes.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.133
And-and _now this
IS HIXIe.
Okay.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.240
She snarls at homeless people,
which is embarrassing,

00:49.280 --> 00:51.202
but _she hasn't ever
bitten anyone.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.774
Now, Hixie only goes
on the grass

00:52.820 --> 00:54.674
in front of the Children's Zoo.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.484
Now, Patches here
will go anywhere.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.511
But please remember
that she is lactose intolerant.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.255
You sure you got all that?
MAN: Totally.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.326
No milk for Hixie.
Uh, P-Patches.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.123
No. Th-That's Misu.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.425
Your dogs are fine
with me, ma'am.
Okay.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.724
MAN: Dixie? Uh...

01:10.770 --> 01:12.192
Hey!
Dixie?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.229
Hi. Look at you.
Patches?

01:13.270 --> 01:14.339
Uh, Kafka?

01:14.370 --> 01:15.496
This isn't Dixie.

01:15.540 --> 01:16.859
This is Patches, right?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.161
That's Dixie.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.438
Dixie can't walk

01:19.480 --> 01:21.402
in the heat for more
than eight minutes

01:21.440 --> 01:23.305
without hyperventilating
and her tongue swelling up.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.477
Misu will only poop on the
north side of 6lst Street,

01:25.510 --> 01:27.740
and occasionally on the
doorman's shoes at the Pierre.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.213
It's a long story.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.410
Hixie-- she needs
an attitude adjustment.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.259
And that there is Kafka.

01:32.290 --> 01:35.384
Kafka has cataracts and
is due for drops in...

01:35.420 --> 01:36.648
14 minutes.

01:36.690 --> 01:39.193
Uh, h

01:39.230 --> 01:40.652
Oh, well, I was
eavesdropping.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.328
And I remember everything.
Listen, do you...

01:43.370 --> 01:45.429
Do you want to walk half of 'em?
I'll split the money.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.358
Oh, no, that's okay.
I already have a job.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.163
Here. Here you go.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.438
Dixie left you
a little surprise

01:50.470 --> 01:51.607
over there by the fire hydrant.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.528
I would pick it
up if I were you.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.332
I haven't got time.
I got to get to class.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.645
No, no, no, really... you
might want to pick that up.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.375
Sure.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.445
All right, have a good day.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.457
* You wake me up,
you wake me up. *

02:07.520 --> 02:08.885
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.729
I thought you could all
use a little change

02:10.760 --> 02:12.352
from your regular
morning coffee,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.527
so fresh-pressed organic juices

02:14.560 --> 02:16.198
from the
Pune Press Express.

02:16.230 --> 02:17.492
Try it.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.939
Uh, what's in this?

02:20.970 --> 02:22.801
What isn't?
It's a Reset A-Gogo.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.501
It has pineapple, ginger,

02:24.540 --> 02:26.428
lime and chili.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.333
Chili?
CARRIE:
Mmm.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.938
AL:
Okay.
Oh, thank you.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.443
I think I'll, uh, save mine
for lunch.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.640
Wheat grass alfalfa swirl?

02:33.680 --> 02:35.341
Come on, it's the milkshake
of the gods.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.347
And the cows?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.516
_ Hello. _
SpeCIal occasron?

02:37.550 --> 02:38.687
Yes, actually.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.326
The weekend's almost here,
so I got you a little surprise.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.679
I hate surprises.

02:43.730 --> 02:44.958
Oh, come on,
it's fennel juice.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.218
That's why

02:46.260 --> 02:47.249
I hate surprises.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.494
It's not really, it's lemonade.

02:48.530 --> 02:49.565
Why don't you try it.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.693
Yum-yum.
Mm-hmm.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.368
Unsweetened.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.833
Mmm.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.532
The truth is, I have a
little surprise for you.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.730
How about a nice little
paId vacation?

03:01.780 --> 03:04.977
I have a little summer cottage,
out on the Island.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.477
It's all yours.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.373
And what's the catch?

03:07.420 --> 03:09.308
Does there always
have to be a catch?

03:09.350 --> 03:10.317
Yes.
Yes.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.614
Okay, it seems

03:12.660 --> 03:14.787
the mayor's press secretary,
Sandy Elsworth,

03:14.820 --> 03:16.685
he's got a little place
in Southampton Village,

03:16.730 --> 03:18.880
and, I don't know,
I guess his kids are friends

03:18.930 --> 03:20.625
with the kids of
the mayor out there...

03:20.660 --> 03:21.627
Mm

03:21.660 --> 03:23.628
The point is,
this morning,

03:23.670 --> 03:24.967
the body of a young
woman washed up

03:25.000 --> 03:26.490
on the beach in
front of his house.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.962
Southampton Village
has officially

03:28.000 --> 03:29.638
requested our assistance.

03:29.670 --> 03:30.500
The local police
can't handle it?

03:30.540 --> 03:32.474
Long Island serial killer.

03:32.510 --> 03:33.670
ELIOT:
Exactly.
Oh.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.405
14 victims
in the last ten years,

03:35.440 --> 03:36.407
most of them young women

03:36.450 --> 03:37.474
dumped on the shore.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.444
If this is number 15,
I want you guys out there.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.914
So our little paid vacation
is actually

03:41.950 --> 03:43.417
hunting a serial killer.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.486
Don't forget to pack sunscreen.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.605
Yeah, she washed up
right about here.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.868
No ID, no shoes.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.775
Just the, uh, dress
she went in with.

04:08.810 --> 04:09.799
I think he's back at it.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.602
AL: You think she's a victim
of the serial killer?

04:11.650 --> 04:13.049
She fits the profile.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.638
The previous victims
were all young,

04:14.680 --> 04:17.444
attractive women found
near the water's edge, so...

04:17.490 --> 04:18.343
Yeah, that's true.

04:18.390 --> 04:20.312
I believe they were
all dead, as well.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.920
CARRIE: I think what Al
IS trying to say

04:22.960 --> 04:24.825
is that we're gonna need more

04:24.860 --> 04:27.055
before we identify her
as the 15th victim.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.998
Yeah, of course.
The fact is,

04:28.030 --> 04:30.294
the other girls,
they washed up farther west,

04:30.330 --> 04:31.922
along the Ocean ParloNay,
Gilgo Beach area.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.289
Right, but based on

04:33.340 --> 04:34.898
my analysis of
the current patterns,

04:34.940 --> 04:37.033
I believe the body could've been
carried this far east.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.607
Okay, I'd like to
see that analysis.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.609
But if she is number 15,
could also mean

04:42.650 --> 04:43.947
our guy's got
a new dumping ground.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.572
Anyone I.D. her?

04:45.610 --> 04:47.441
Canvassed the beach, thrown up
some flyers around town.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.742
So far, no one's
recognized her.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.678
What about local ﬁshermen?

04:49.720 --> 04:51.483
Maybe one of them saw
something unusual.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.852
Maybe.
You haven't
talked to 'em yet?

04:53.890 --> 04:55.778
Sir, there are
only four officers

04:55.820 --> 04:57.481
on the Southampton Village
police force.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.952
One's away
at his sister's wedding,

04:58.990 --> 05:02.323
two are on parking patrol,
so that just leaves me.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.997
Okay.

05:04.030 --> 05:05.099
Hey, Jo.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.597
WEBSTER:
So, I hear your victim's

05:06.640 --> 05:07.959
at some local morgue
out there.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.831
I thought I'd come out
and give you a hand.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.577
Oh, no, Jo, uh,
Al and I have got it.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.032
Don't ruin your weekend.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.346
Carrie, you have no idea
about these rural coroners.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.872
I've heard of some morgues
doubling as feed stores.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.946
Jo, it's the Hamptons,
not Kansas, okay?

05:24.990 --> 05:26.048
How's the weather?

05:26.090 --> 05:27.455
Uh... the weather's great.

05:27.490 --> 05:28.787
It's nice.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.425
Jo, you don't need to come
all the way out here.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.519
I'm telling you,
it is not a problem.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.754
Yeah,

05:34.800 --> 05:36.427
I'm getting the sense
that's it not.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.825
Oh, let me ask...

05:38.870 --> 05:40.462
how's the house?

05:51.450 --> 05:54.044
Some cottage.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.385
Wow.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.560
I want to live here.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.430
Great kitchen.

06:15.470 --> 06:17.438
I might just
cook tonight.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.935
Wow, this is amazing.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.641
This fridge is bigger
than my apartment.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.409
Probably gets
more light, too.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.489
Oh, my God.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.182
Okay, so Eliot's "little
cottage" in the Hamptons

06:36.220 --> 06:38.484
comes with
a not so little pool.

06:38.530 --> 06:40.054
And a Jacuzzi.
Mmm.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.419
Doesn't really
change anything.

06:41.460 --> 06:42.927
Might actually
explain a few things.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.097
Yeah, like why he's so hard
to reach on the weekend?

06:46.230 --> 06:50.166
Ah, a text from
young Officer Gosling.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.132
They got a Missing Persons
fitting our victim.

06:52.170 --> 06:54.775
Parents just
I.D.'d the body.

06:54.810 --> 06:58.769
Shelly Branigan--
23 years old, from Islip.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.919
WOMAN:
Shelly was the best daughter

07:04.950 --> 07:07.180
any parent could ever want.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.154
She was my heart.

07:09.190 --> 07:11.078
Mrs. Branigan,
can you think of anyone

07:11.130 --> 07:13.052
who might have wanted
to hurt her?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.624
A jealous boyfriend?

07:14.660 --> 07:16.150
She didn't have a boyfriend.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.088
She was studying to get her GED

07:18.130 --> 07:20.189
and then go on
to nursing school.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.764
Course that dream
had to be put on hold

07:21.800 --> 07:22.835
when James had his accident.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.201
What happened?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.777
Girder collapsed
on my last construction job.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.505
Crushed my leg.
CARRIE:
I'm so sorry.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.178
AL:
Did Shelly work?

07:30.210 --> 07:31.643
It was a tough commute,

07:31.680 --> 07:32.942
but she found something
over in the Hamptons.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.538
A waitressing job

07:34.580 --> 07:36.844
at Junior's Cafe near Watermill.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.845
Ah.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.983
Excuse me.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.851
CARRIE: Who's the artist?
JAMES: Our son, Spencer.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.619
He's eight.

07:46.660 --> 07:47.820
Oh.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.966
WOMAN: He and his sister
were very close.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.236
AL: According to
bank records,

07:54.270 --> 07:56.067
Shelly recently
deposited $10,000

07:56.100 --> 07:58.000
into her
checking account.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.200
Any idea where

07:59.240 --> 08:00.776
she could've gotten
that kind of money?

08:00.810 --> 08:02.209
She made minimum wage plus tips.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.242
There's no way
she had that kind of money.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.540
Everything here is
how she left it.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.986
Last time I saw her,
she was getting ready

08:15.020 --> 08:17.727
to go out.

08:20.030 --> 08:21.122
Any idea where?

08:21.160 --> 08:23.993
I saw her for a minute when
she got back from work,

08:24.030 --> 08:26.123
around 7:00.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.569
She mentioned something
about a party.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.739
I don't remember where.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.068
She was 23.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.805
I didn't ask.

08:36.610 --> 08:38.100
Why didn't I?

08:47.190 --> 08:48.817
Yeah.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.282
Hey, Dr. Webster.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.854
Bet you don't encounter
many of these

08:51.890 --> 08:53.198
in your neck of the woods.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.219
Can't say I do.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.227
Call me Jo.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.296
Yeah. Theodore Blumer. Ted.

08:57.330 --> 09:00.629
"And my boy, Joel,
who knew the stars,

09:00.670 --> 09:02.809
"he used to say
it took millions of years

09:02.840 --> 09:05.638
for that speck 0' light
to git to the earth."

09:05.670 --> 09:07.774
First time I've heard
Thornton Wilder

09:07.810 --> 09:09.232
recited at an autopsy.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.907
Yeah, well,
we're doing Our Town

09:10.950 --> 09:12.577
at the Village Playhouse.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.576
Let me guess, you're playing
the Stage Manager?

09:14.620 --> 09:16.588
I wish.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.884
Doc Gibbs. I had the lab coat.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.616
Boy, it looks like she's been
in the water a long time.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.026
Well, judging by
the decomposition, I would say

09:24.060 --> 09:25.322
a couple of days,
but she was dead

09:25.360 --> 09:26.691
before she ever hit the drink.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.254
How'd you reach that conclusion?

09:28.300 --> 09:31.189
Well, there wasn't
a drop of water in her lungs.

09:31.230 --> 09:34.233
And besides, there's this.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.363
Oh.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.732
Penetrating wound to
the brachial artery.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.738
You're thinking exsanguination.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.099
Certainly not the MO

09:42.140 --> 09:44.199
of the Long Island
serial killer.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.844
He strangles his victims.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.609
Oh, you're familiar
with those cases.

09:48.650 --> 09:49.787
I should be.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.287
I autopsied
seven of them.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.356
I was not aware of that.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.948
Uh, judging
from the wound,

09:54.990 --> 09:57.322
the murder weapon is
approximately three inches long

09:57.360 --> 10:00.124
with rather dull edges.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.297
You're very thorough.

10:02.330 --> 10:03.991
For a country coroner.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.066
What were you expecting?

10:06.100 --> 10:08.136
A potato farmer?

10:08.170 --> 10:10.400
No, actually,
a feed store operator.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.407
Oh.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.032
I was expecting

10:13.080 --> 10:15.674
a condescending elitist
from the city.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.341
Well, now that we've gotten
that straightened out,

10:19.380 --> 10:21.075
let's get to work, shall we?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.917
Liver tests that we ran

10:22.950 --> 10:24.918
on previous victims
of the killer

10:24.950 --> 10:27.657
showed a high
alcohol content.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.829
But her blood alcohol was .016.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.920
That's a glass of wine
at dinner.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.258
Any idea what dinner was,
or where?

10:35.300 --> 10:38.963
Unfortunately, the critters
devoured her stomach contents.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.936
Few people realize
that starfish are carnivorous.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.173
to perform a necropsy

10:47.210 --> 10:49.974
if we're gonna learn
what she had for dinner.

10:50.010 --> 10:51.170
Are you serious?

10:51.210 --> 10:53.144
You're gonna do an
autopsy on a starfish?

10:53.180 --> 10:54.442
Welcome to the seashore.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.812
Oh, man.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.109
Shelly was super sweet.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.388
All the customers loved her.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.422
She ever have any problems
with anyone around here?

11:06.460 --> 11:07.893
She pretty much
kept to herself.

11:07.930 --> 11:09.329
I mean, she didn't
go out partying

11:09.360 --> 11:11.123
like most of the kids
around here.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.194
Right.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.937
But her mom said she was
at a party Wednesday night.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.437
If she was,
I didn't know about it.

11:16.470 --> 11:19.337
She also just put $10,000
into her checking account.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.201
Any idea where that came from?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.969
Not from here,
that's for sure.

11:23.010 --> 11:25.706
She mentioned
wanting to find

11:25.750 --> 11:27.741
another job
after her dad's accident.

11:27.780 --> 11:29.418
Well, if you wanted
to make extra money,

11:29.450 --> 11:31.987
where would you go around here?
I'd check out the board.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.385
People post all kinds
of things on there.

11:33.420 --> 11:36.389
Waitressing jobs, catering.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.962
How about a charter boat?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.729
Pay's good,

11:44.770 --> 11:46.419
if you can stand
eight hours on the water

11:46.470 --> 11:49.166
serving margaritas
to a boatload of drunk cidiots.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.236
"Cidiots"?

11:51.270 --> 11:52.430
Idiots from the city.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.301
Present company excluded.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.433
What about, uh,
Green Dolphin Charters?

11:56.480 --> 11:58.243
She ever mention them?

11:58.280 --> 12:00.009
Saw her talking
to Todd about it.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.517
I don't know if
she followed up.
Who's Todd?

12:01.550 --> 12:03.518
Todd Peck.
He owns Green Dolphin.

12:03.550 --> 12:04.881
Comes in here sometimes.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.478
Huh.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.488
Hey, Tim.

12:12.530 --> 12:13.827
I took care of that

12:13.860 --> 12:15.498
lapsed registration
last week.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.020
We're not here
about that, Todd.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.264
Hey, Todd.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.528
You know Shelly Branigan?

12:19.570 --> 12:21.765
Nope, but I heard
they pulled some chick

12:21.800 --> 12:23.358
_ out of the water _
over in Southampton Village.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.763
Is that her?

12:24.810 --> 12:25.936
Why don't you tell me.

12:25.970 --> 12:27.835
I found this in her bedroom.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.507
I give those things out
all over town; called marketing.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.508
Oh, yeah? Well, this...

12:31.550 --> 12:33.768
is called an
arrest record.

12:33.820 --> 12:34.548
And, oh, look!

12:34.580 --> 12:36.343
This one is yours.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.540
Yeah, attempted rape.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.511
In Maine.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.051
That was _
an underage college girl

12:40.090 --> 12:41.819
who freaked out
when I wouldn't marry her.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.054
Todd, we've also
got several

12:43.090 --> 12:45.854
unprosecuted complaints against
you from locals you hired.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.289
Those are bogus
and you know it, Tim.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.297
Where were you
Wednesday night?

12:48.330 --> 12:49.490
Down at the Five Hole.
It's a bar.

12:49.530 --> 12:51.088
I got friends
that can back me up.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.360
You ever go sailing in
the Gilgo Beach area?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.288
I go wherever my clients
want me to.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.228
Depends on where
the fish are running. Why?

12:57.270 --> 12:58.908
That area happens to be
the dumping ground

12:58.940 --> 13:00.476
for the Long Island
serial killer.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.034
Get the hell out of here!

13:02.080 --> 13:03.445
I got a waitress

13:03.480 --> 13:05.345
at Junior's Cafe
who says you're a regular.

13:05.380 --> 13:06.813
She says you knew
Shelly Branigan.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.272
It's a small town.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.208
Guess what, Todd.
If you don't start talking,

13:10.250 --> 13:12.343
I'm gonna set Tim here
loose on your boat,

13:12.390 --> 13:14.483
and I'm sure he's gonna find
plenty of safety violations.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.511
Okay, okay.
I did know Shelly.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.050
She called me up a few weeks ago
to work a charter trip.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.863
Said she needed extra cash.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.368
I'm sure she just
leapt at the chance.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.936
Actually, she called me up
a few days later,

13:27.970 --> 13:29.335
said she didn't need
the money after all.

13:29.370 --> 13:30.564
I figured she landed
some trust-funder.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.532
That's what most of the girls
around here are looking for.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.538
I'm gonna need to see
your nautical logbooks

13:34.580 --> 13:36.138
from the past two years.

13:36.180 --> 13:37.477
Come on, lady,
I don't have time for that.

13:37.510 --> 13:38.602
I got a business to run.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.471
No. You don't got
a business to run.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.839
Not anymore.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.482
Oh, yeah, look at this.
Your permit.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.899
Consider yourself closed
until further notice, okay?

13:53.930 --> 13:56.251
Tim, you gonna let her
get away with this?

13:56.300 --> 13:58.495
Can't be operating
without a license, Todd.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.065
Look, according to
these logbooks,

14:03.110 --> 14:05.635
Peck was in Maine when most of
the serial killings occurred.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.604
Just because he's not good
for the serial killings

14:07.640 --> 14:09.471
doesn't mean
he didn't murder Shelly.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.205
Yep.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.649
Hey, Jo.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.568
WEBSTER: Oh, listen, I e-mailed
you some autopsy photos.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.111
Hang on, I'm gonna put you
on speaker. Al's here.

14:17.150 --> 14:18.117
We're on speaker.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.879
Ah.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.356
I'm here with Dr. Blumer, the
Southampton medical examiner.

14:23.390 --> 14:24.982
It was definitely
a homicide.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.998
The victim bled out
from a stab wound.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.294
BLUMER: We found ligature marks
on her wrists.

14:29.330 --> 14:30.558
It looks like
she was tied with rope

14:30.600 --> 14:31.965
and then weighed down
with something.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.137
That's what
a ligature is.

14:33.170 --> 14:34.899
I know, I'm telling them.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.965
Hey, Jo.

14:41.210 --> 14:44.099
I think I know
where that rope might be.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.209
WEBSTER:
Also, we believe

14:46.250 --> 14:48.218
the victim's last_ meal
included caVIar,

14:48.250 --> 14:49.672
and based on the roe,

14:49.720 --> 14:51.381
a very special
kind of caviar.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.355
Volga Reserve Ossetra.

14:54.390 --> 14:57.359
Starts at $532 an ounce.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.449
Can't be too many places
serving that, even around here.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.269
WOMAN: Last time I saw her,
she was getting ready to go out.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.599
She mentioned something
about a party.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.562
AL:
Some cottage.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.545
Dr. Blumer, uh, do you know
of a family around here

15:18.580 --> 15:20.070
by the name of Mortimer?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.178
Uh, yes, George Mortimer.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.710
He has a place
on Further Lane.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.717
What do you know about him?

15:23.750 --> 15:25.183
He's rich.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.517
Old money.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.609
Uh, beside that,
just, you know, what you hear.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.686
Fast boats,
fast cars, fast horses.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.493
His daughter is getting married,
I think.

15:33.530 --> 15:34.554
Huh.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.726
Oh, did I mention he's rich?

15:35.760 --> 15:39.560
WEBSTER: Carrie, it doesn't
sound as though our victim

15:39.600 --> 15:40.999
kept that kind
of company.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.429
Well, she did
the night she died.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.125
What the hell happened to you?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.286
Ah, nothing.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.524
I'm fine.
Just, you know that rope

16:07.560 --> 16:09.323
you wanted me
to find on the beach

16:09.360 --> 16:10.292
from the victim?

16:10.330 --> 16:11.763
Well, it seems
that stray dogs

16:11.800 --> 16:13.734
don't take too kind
to having their chew toys

16:13.770 --> 16:15.294
_ confiscated
as crime scene eVIdence.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.308
So did you, uh...
get the rope?

16:17.340 --> 16:18.739
At the lab now.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.374
Great.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.207
Yes, my daughter's
engagement party.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.174
Quite the little soire.

16:24.210 --> 16:26.303
Rowena, when you're
done with that,

16:26.350 --> 16:28.238
I need you in the kitchen.
Rpido.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.315
Rpido.
Come on, chop chop.

16:29.350 --> 16:30.317
You're killing me.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.341
Uh, to tell
you the truth,

16:32.390 --> 16:36.554
I thought for sure, uh,
you boys would be up here,

16:36.590 --> 16:39.229
what, with the music going
till, uh, after 2:00 am.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.558
Chicago blues--

16:41.600 --> 16:42.521
my daughter loves it.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.028
Flew the whole band out here
for the weekend.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.394
Uh, now what is this about
a murder investigation?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.169
Her name's Shelly Branigan.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.405
Her body was found on the beach
yesterday morning.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.374
Oh, of course.
I heard about that.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.105
Over at
the Elsworth place.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.539
Ah, poor girl.
What can I do for you?

16:57.580 --> 16:59.138
We have reason to believe

16:59.180 --> 17:01.171
she was at your home
the night she died.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.471
At our party?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.511
Uh, I don't think so.

17:04.550 --> 17:05.585
Could she have
been working, sir?

17:05.620 --> 17:06.587
On the waitstaff?

17:06.620 --> 17:08.156
I suppose it's possible.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.579
Um, you should check
with Lizzy or Travis.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.120
They organized the event.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.593
I just paid for it.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.598
Wow, it must have been
an incredible night.

17:15.630 --> 17:20.192
I mean, the music,
the food...

17:20.240 --> 17:22.458
I bet she had
an ama2ing time.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.138
Thank you.
Yeah.

17:24.170 --> 17:27.333
Yes, it, uh...
it was a magical evening.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.336
And you served the
Volga Reserve Ossetra caviar.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.449
I mean, come on, really.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.209
Carrie.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.478
I know, I know, I know.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.112
I said I wouldn't
say anything, but...

17:35.150 --> 17:36.117
And yet you are.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.310
CARRIE:
I'm such a foodie.

17:37.350 --> 17:38.681
I-I found the menu.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.119
Someone _must_ have
posted it online.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.720
That's...
I mean, the Reserve?

17:42.760 --> 17:44.227
This time of year?

17:44.260 --> 17:46.228
Well, you certainly know
your fish eggs, don't you?

17:46.260 --> 17:47.227
Yeah.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.625
Well, you're quite right.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.127
It is very rare.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.660
In fact, I prefer it
to the beluga.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.598
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

17:52.630 --> 17:53.460
I mean, after all,

17:53.500 --> 17:56.492
your daughter only
gets engaged once.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.609
Yeah.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.631
You hope.
Right.

17:59.670 --> 18:01.706
Would it be possible
to speak with Travis?

18:01.740 --> 18:03.549
Yes. This way.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.648
Oh, excuse me for a sec.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.716
Hello?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.453
There they are.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.583
Travis is not much
of a tennis player,

18:17.630 --> 18:19.848
but he was top of his class
at Wharton.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.688
He'll be joining us
this fall at the firm.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.561
LIZZY: Well, she wasn't
one of my guests.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.567
Did you invite her?

18:27.500 --> 18:28.762
No, I've never
seen her before. Sorry.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.700
Maybe she worked
on the catering staff?

18:30.740 --> 18:33.800
Uh, I forget, which one
did we go with, Travis?

18:33.840 --> 18:36.138
Uh... The Fish Monger.
It's down at the market

18:36.180 --> 18:37.909
on one of those streets
with the name...

18:37.950 --> 18:39.872
Birch Road.
Right.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.446
I'm sure they'll have
the list of waitstaff.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.617
If it's okay, we'd also like

18:42.650 --> 18:44.186
the invitation list
to the party.

18:44.220 --> 18:45.619
Oh, of course.

18:45.650 --> 18:48.448
But, uh, what makes you think
the poor girl was here?

18:48.490 --> 18:50.651
We're not at liberty
to say at this time.

18:50.690 --> 18:51.554
TRAVIS:
Okay, we understand.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.784
We'll forward you
our list and RSVPs.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.650
Whatever we can
do to help.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.292
I mean, my God,
it's... it's awful.

18:56.330 --> 18:57.422
All right, thanks.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.869
You want me to
show you out?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.698
We're fine.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.298
You ever read
The Great Gatsby?

19:03.340 --> 19:04.637
Welcome to my world.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.331
Mortimer's got
a Bentley convertible,

19:06.370 --> 19:08.736
parks it in the handicapped
every time he comes to town.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.805
I must have given him
20 tickets myself.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.602
I don't think
he's paid a one.

19:12.650 --> 19:15.778
Just donates another statue
to the garden at City Hall.

19:15.820 --> 19:16.775
Welcome to the Hamptons.

19:16.820 --> 19:17.946
That was nice back there,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.548
with the "we're not
at liberty" stuff.

19:19.590 --> 19:20.557
Tha'nks.

19:20.590 --> 19:21.557
Where'd you get that?

19:21.590 --> 19:23.285
Saw it on TV.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.495
We have about 20 people
on our catering staff.

19:30.530 --> 19:31.929
Mostly locals who've been
with us for years.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.632
The catering supervisor
is the one that does

19:34.670 --> 19:37.230
the hiring and firing.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.703
Hey, Bob?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.207
CARRIE:
Thank you.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.743
Shelly Branigan?

19:44.780 --> 19:46.668
Name doesn't ring a bell.

19:46.710 --> 19:47.938
Hey, Jerry...

19:49.480 --> 19:50.686
Not so hard.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.642
Here.
You're chewing it up.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.214
Doesn't ring
a bell, huh?

19:54.260 --> 19:57.252
You know, let me
check the staff list

19:57.290 --> 19:59.588
in case maybe
she worked freelance.

19:59.630 --> 20:01.518
All right, Branigan.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.596
Uh, Branigan, Branigan,
Branigan.

20:03.630 --> 20:04.790
Branigan.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.922
Sorry, nope. No Branigan.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.291
You do a lot of work
for George Mortimer?

20:08.340 --> 20:09.466
A fair amount.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.762
He likes to entertain.
Yeah?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.835
Do any of his
parties ever get...

20:12.870 --> 20:14.906
I don't know, crazy,
out of control?

20:14.940 --> 20:18.307
Look, this doesn't
come from me, okay?

20:18.350 --> 20:19.772
Mortimer's kind of
a big man around here.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.675
Totally off the record.
Promise.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.847
All right.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.812
Some of my waitresses have...

20:25.850 --> 20:28.512
you know, complained about him.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.778
Can you be a little
more specific, Bob?

20:30.830 --> 20:33.321
They say once he's knocked back
a few G and T's,

20:33.360 --> 20:34.850
can't keep his hands to himself.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.959
_ Ah.
EspeCIally around
the local girls.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.594
The ones who can't
fight back, right?

20:39.630 --> 20:40.597
Right.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.459
Those kind.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.592
Yeah.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.847
Some town
you got here, Tim.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.643
You grew up here?
Noyac.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.887
After college, I bummed around
the country for a bit,

20:57.920 --> 20:59.683
but something always
pulled me back here.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.484
I guess the salt air
gets into your blood, huh?

21:02.520 --> 21:03.885
Hey, Chris,
how you doing?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.357
Hey, everyone, come here!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.799
I want to ask you
a few questions.

21:09.830 --> 21:10.797
All right,
come on, guys.

21:10.830 --> 21:11.865
Guys, come on.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.299
Guys... guys,
stop playing games!

21:13.340 --> 21:14.534
Stop, circle up.

21:14.570 --> 21:15.764
It'll take two minutes.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.802
You were all on the invite list

21:17.840 --> 21:19.728
for the Mortimer's party
the other night.

21:19.770 --> 21:21.738
_ I want_ to know
if you recognize this woman.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.748
I don't.
Did you look at it?

21:23.780 --> 21:24.906
No.
Nah, not me.

21:24.950 --> 21:25.905
Uh-uh.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.076
Hey, take a look.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.077
Guys, focus.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.678
You see her?
Never have.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.846
Nah, she doesn't
look familiar, man.
Are you sure?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.482
MAN: So many people
were there that night.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.487
There's no way you can tell.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.909
Nope, not me.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.382
No.
Mm-mm.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.783
Nah.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.627
Okay, thanks.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.457
Let us know
if you hear anything.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.934
Why'd that kid seem
embarrassed that you knew him?

21:47.970 --> 21:48.891
Chris?
Yeah.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.089
Probably 'cause
he's a local.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.903
His dad's a plumber
here in town.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.669
He wants to run
with the big dogs.

21:53.710 --> 21:54.836
Give me a second.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.939
Chris!

21:56.980 --> 21:58.072
Come here.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.907
I want to talk to you.

21:59.950 --> 22:01.975
Now, listen, I've been
doing this a long time.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.840
I think you've
got more to say.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.915
Ah, not really.
Hey, Chris.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.417
Girl's dead.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.485
Local kid, just like you.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.783
I don't want to stir
anything up, all right?

22:12.830 --> 22:14.388
These guys are my friends.

22:14.430 --> 22:15.522
Yeah, you really believe that?

22:16.830 --> 22:18.695
You think you'll still
be in their lives

22:18.730 --> 22:20.561
when they go back
to Manhattan, Moscow,

22:20.600 --> 22:21.931
wherever it is
they're from?

22:23.940 --> 22:26.807
All right, I might have seen her
at the party.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.377
But I'm not sure.

22:29.410 --> 22:30.604
Where?

22:30.650 --> 22:31.742
Backyard.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.099
Was she with anyone?
Talking to anyone?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.845
Nah, she was pretty much
on her own.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.643
She seemed a little
out of place.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.443
Probably why I picked up on her.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.684
I've been there.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.654
Me, too.

22:41.690 --> 22:42.850
Thanks for stepping up.

22:48.130 --> 22:51.691
WEBSTER: So, I went over
the serial killer case files

22:51.730 --> 22:53.595
with Dr. Blumer.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.837
And the previous victims
were all strangled

22:56.870 --> 22:58.861
and partially dismembered.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.799
Frankly, this case
does not fit the bill.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.908
What?

23:03.950 --> 23:06.100
What is it with you
and this Blumer guy?

23:06.150 --> 23:07.640
Every time you
talk about him

23:07.680 --> 23:09.944
you get this weird little smile
on your face.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.447
Oh,' no.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.515
I just find him interesting,
that's all.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.619
I mean, he's actually doing
a play at the local theater.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.150
How many coroners
do you know...?
See, right there.

23:17.190 --> 23:18.782
VVhat
There it is,
there it is.

23:18.830 --> 23:19.728
T_his weird little
smile on your face.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.727
AL:
Honey, I'm home!

23:20.760 --> 23:21.727
He's just doing a play.

23:21.760 --> 23:22.852
You like him.
No.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.891
So...

23:24.930 --> 23:26.192
I checked with the lab.
Yeah.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.788
That rope from
the beach--

23:27.840 --> 23:30.707
it's sold with a specific
brand of Zodiac dinghy.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.469
Guess who owns two of them.

23:32.510 --> 23:33.169
George Mortimer.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.472
How'd you know?

23:34.510 --> 23:35.909
JAY: _
Hey, Carrie?

23:35.940 --> 23:38.579
The jets in the Jacuzzi
aren't jetting.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.168
Jay?

23:40.210 --> 23:42.474
Hey.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.943
I, uh...

23:44.990 --> 23:47.049
thought you guys could,
uh, use some help.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.557
With the Jacuzzi?

23:48.590 --> 23:50.524
Nah, I thought
I could cross-reference

23:50.560 --> 23:51.720
some suspect profiles,

23:51.760 --> 23:53.489
run some data analysis...
CARRIE: Jay?

23:53.530 --> 23:55.225
I also understand
you need some access

23:55.260 --> 23:57.023
to financial files.
Jay.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.028
He's not... he's not buying it.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.868
Okay, look.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.209
The city's a freakin' sauna,
my air conditioning is busted,

24:04.240 --> 24:07.607
and I really wanted to check out
Eliot's place, so...

24:07.640 --> 24:08.675
All right, Jay.

24:08.710 --> 24:09.779
Well, you're gonna have

24:09.810 --> 24:10.970
to earn your keep.
Really?

24:11.010 --> 24:13.979
Uh, well, when do we start?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.578
Yeah, Tim?

24:15.620 --> 24:16.609
Okay, we'll meet
you there.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.015
How about now?

24:18.050 --> 24:19.039
We got a warrant

24:19.090 --> 24:20.045
for Mortimer's place.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.682
Yes!

24:26.060 --> 24:28.858
What's the probable cause
for this search?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.026
It's all right here
in this warrant.

24:30.060 --> 24:30.958
This is absurd.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.797
GOSLING: I found this
in one on the Zodiacs.

24:32.830 --> 24:34.730
Thought we could compare it
to the rope from the beach.

24:34.770 --> 24:36.135
Looks like it just
came off the shelf.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.001
Do you just buy a new anchor
for your boat?

24:38.040 --> 24:39.632
You don't have to
answer that, George.

24:39.670 --> 24:41.877
I most certainly did not.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.639
What are they doing
with that spray?

24:43.680 --> 24:44.647
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Don't get sprayed.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.942
Watch where you step,
watch where you step.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.072
That's called luminol.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.111
And what is luminol?

24:48.150 --> 24:49.139
It's a chemiluminescent,

24:49.180 --> 24:51.978
which means it glows in
the presence of blood.

24:52.020 --> 24:54.056
MAN: All right, we're ready.
Light it up.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.181
JAY:
Just like that.

25:02.330 --> 25:04.525
Don't say a word.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.999
There were over 250 people
at his home for that party.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.974
Any one of them had access
to that boathouse.

25:17.010 --> 25:17.977
End of story.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.001
I have another story.

25:20.050 --> 25:22.109
Shelly was
an attractive young woman.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.744
Maybe you'd seen her
at Junior's

25:24.790 --> 25:25.882
out on Montauk Highway.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.649
Maybe not.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.988
But that night,
she caught your eye.

25:30.020 --> 25:33.592
You invited her down to
the boathouse for a little fun.

25:33.630 --> 25:34.858
Things got hot.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.253
She rejected you.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.961
You killed her.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.093
Let's say... accidentally.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.597
That is preposterous.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.289
George, don't say another word.

25:43.340 --> 25:46.138
_ Lieutenant Burns
is telling us a story.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.001
At first, you panic.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.873
But then you realize you have
the perfect escape route.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.104
The water.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.913
So you throw her body
into the Zodiac,

25:53.950 --> 25:56.009
tie her to an anchor,
dump her in the sea.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.915
Problem is the rope frays.

25:57.950 --> 26:01.010
The body surfaces...

26:01.060 --> 26:03.984
floating inconveniently ashore.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.021
Bringing us all here today.

26:06.060 --> 26:09.325
That is a fine story,
Lieutenant.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.090
I suggest you hold on to it.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.939
Who knows?

26:13.970 --> 26:16.336
It might even make a fine
novel or screenplay someday.

26:16.370 --> 26:19.168
You may have even found
your own true calling.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.929
But know this.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.073
If you ever call my
client in here again

26:24.110 --> 26:25.077
and accuse him of murder,

26:25.110 --> 26:28.910
it'll be the only calling
available to you.

26:28.950 --> 26:30.941
We're leaving now.

26:41.330 --> 26:42.820
What are you doing here?

26:42.860 --> 26:44.999
Well, I heard you had
a big fish on the line.

26:45.030 --> 26:46.827
He just swam right by you.

26:46.870 --> 26:48.360
Oh.
Let me guess.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.288
Thought you'd come out,
give us a hand?

26:50.340 --> 26:52.069
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

26:55.010 --> 26:57.331
*

27:02.050 --> 27:04.018
Hey, everybody.
CARRIE: Hello!

27:04.050 --> 27:06.041
Murray, how do you like
your bluefish?

27:06.090 --> 27:08.285
Jay, that is a very
personal question.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.719
No, I was just asking...

27:09.760 --> 27:12.081
Wh

27:12.130 --> 27:13.222
Surprise me, Jay.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.852
JAY: You won't be
disappointed.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.764
You get anything
on that anchor?

27:17.800 --> 27:18.789
It's what we thought.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.195
The luminol showed
a lot of blood

27:20.230 --> 27:22.164
all over the boathouse,
nothing on the anchor.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.737
So we prove Mortimer bought
the new anchor, we got him.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.135
You know what?

27:26.170 --> 27:28.172
I'll check all the nautical
supply shops in the area.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.905
Yeah, you do that.
I got this.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.043
Come on.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.270
Oh, Murray, would you
get that for me, please?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.309
Sure.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.239
Hello?

27:39.290 --> 27:41.986
Oh, uh... sure.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.022
Just, uh, hold on one second.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.029
It's Ted for Jo.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.425
Ted

27:48.460 --> 27:50.098
Oh, it's-it's just
a work thing.

27:50.130 --> 27:53.167
It's the local M.E.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.088
Hello?

27:55.140 --> 27:57.859
Oh,'yes

27:57.910 --> 27:59.161
JAY:
Okay, there are literally,

27:59.210 --> 28:01.235
like, a thousand nautical
stores on the island.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.009
Yeah, so get started.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.042
I got this.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.725
Are you sure
you're not hungry?

28:20.760 --> 28:23.126
Nah, I don't have that much
of an appetite.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.468
Nah?
Mm-mm.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.695
Okay, suit yourself.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.738
Yeah, check that out.

28:28.770 --> 28:31.204
His family has produced
three congressmen,

28:31.240 --> 28:34.937
two secretaries of state
and an ambassador to Sweden.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.038
And a hell of a fortune.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.878
CARRIE: Yeah, more money
than Shelly Branigan will see

28:38.910 --> 28:40.275
in a thousand lifetimes.
It doesn't...

28:40.310 --> 28:42.073
it doesn't seem fair, does it?

28:42.120 --> 28:43.417
Well, it's the American way.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.817
Every town's got one--
that big house on the hill.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.159
But what was a little girl
from Islip doing there?

28:49.190 --> 28:52.057
Okay, I've been going
through the phone records

28:52.090 --> 28:53.455
from the diner
where Shelly worked.

28:53.490 --> 28:55.151
It turns out
there's a two-minute phone call

28:55.200 --> 28:57.122
from there
to the Mortimer house.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.366
VVhen?

28:58.400 --> 29:00.197
A few days ago.
That's enough for me.

29:00.230 --> 29:01.834
Hello?
AL: Nah, nah.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.098
You're forgetting,
Mortimer's lawyered up.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.061
We can't go
anywhere near him.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.998
No, I'm sorry,
Eliot's not here.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.132
Can I take a message?

29:10.140 --> 29:12.074
MORTIMER:
Rowena. Rpido. Rpido.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.407
Come on, chop, chop.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.386
Maybe we don't have to.

29:22.990 --> 29:24.423
I really shouldn't be here.

29:24.460 --> 29:27.384
If Mr. Mortimer finds out,
I could be fired.

29:27.430 --> 29:30.399
I understand that we put you
in an uncomfortable position

29:30.430 --> 29:33.126
by asking you here, but we
really do appreciate your help.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.508
Here it is.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.178
Shelly Branigan.

29:42.210 --> 29:43.507
She called last Monday afternoon

29:43.540 --> 29:45.872
and said she was a waitress
at some diner.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.138
Did she ask for Mr. Mortimer?

29:47.180 --> 29:48.977
No, the call was
for Miss Lizzy's fianc,

29:49.020 --> 29:50.214
Mr. Harrington.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.410
Miss Branigan said

29:51.450 --> 29:53.111
he left his jacket
at the restaurant

29:53.150 --> 29:54.048
and he should
come get it.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.149
You're sure it wasn't
for Mr. Mortimer?

29:56.190 --> 29:57.282
Oh, yes.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.526
Miss Branigan?

29:58.560 --> 30:00.323
She asked for Travis.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.248
She knew his name.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.594
Huh.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.063
I went to Junior's
with a bunch of friends

30:08.100 --> 30:09.590
after drinking one night.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.232
Must have forgotten
my jacket then.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.261
You said you didn't
recognize Shelly.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.335
I don't.
Ah.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.201
Travis, we know she waited
on you that night

30:18.250 --> 30:19.205
at Junior's Caf.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.603
We have receipts.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.072
Like I said,
I'd been out drinking.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.269
I didn't recognize the photo.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.185
Yeah, here's
the thing, Travis.

30:25.220 --> 30:26.619
When she called
the Mortimers' house,

30:26.650 --> 30:28.982
she asked for you by name.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.187
So she knew who I was.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.050
Like it or not,
it happens out here.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.055
Mr. Harrington,

30:35.100 --> 30:37.056
we did a little digging
into your financials.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.226
We understand you made

30:38.270 --> 30:39.123
a $10,000 withdrawal

30:39.170 --> 30:41.195
from your bank account
a few days ago.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.639
I've got a wedding
coming up.

30:42.670 --> 30:44.262
That money was a retainer
for the florist.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.231
That an EpiPen?

30:45.270 --> 30:47.534
Uh, yes.

30:47.570 --> 30:49.936
Peanut allergy.
Oh.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.372
CARRIE:
Who's the artist?

30:52.410 --> 30:53.570
JAMES:
Our son Spencer.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.874
He's eight.

30:57.050 --> 30:58.540
Excuse me for a second.

30:58.590 --> 30:59.579
Yeah, sure.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.111
Hey, Jo, I need you

31:02.160 --> 31:03.616
to check something for me.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.287
Engagement party.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.322
Sometimes local kids
try to crash our parties.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.055
You know, free food and booze.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.465
Maybe she came with someone.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.627
Hmm, maybe.

31:13.670 --> 31:14.830
So I was wrong, guys.

31:14.870 --> 31:18.931
There are only 737 nautical
supply shops on Long Island.

31:18.970 --> 31:20.665
In other words, you
haven't traced the anchor.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.234
Whoa, easy, boss.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.407
I mean, I'm working
with some very crude tools here.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.247
I'm luclq ifI can get
3G out here.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.339
Plus, I'm running
some kind of RF interference

31:28.380 --> 31:29.574
on the wireless, so...

31:29.620 --> 31:31.281
In other words,
you haven't traced the anchor.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.311
Okay, you could put it that way.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.453
But I'm working on it.

31:34.490 --> 31:35.650
What do you have on Travis?

31:35.690 --> 31:39.251
Well, first off,
he's not who he says he is.

31:39.290 --> 31:40.518
I ran a full background check.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.949
He grew up
as Travis Harlow in Islip.

31:43.000 --> 31:43.921
He and Shelly were

31:43.970 --> 31:45.665
in the same class at school.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.065
I knew it.

31:47.100 --> 31:47.998
Knew what?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.598
Hey, Jo.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.959
What do you got?

31:51.010 --> 31:52.261
That's what I thought.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.107
Okay, thank you.

31:54.140 --> 31:55.300
Efr-gef:

31:55.340 --> 31:56.602
What do you know?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.949
Come with me, I'll show you.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.299
Travis is a good kid.

32:00.350 --> 32:01.669
He came from
a really rough family.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.642
Lot of drinking
and fighting.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.682
He and his brother Robbie used
to hang out at our house a lot.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.086
I'm sorry, but Travis and Shelly
grew up together?

32:08.120 --> 32:10.384
_You didn't think this was
important for us to know?

32:10.420 --> 32:12.684
They haven't seen each other
in over eight years.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.027
You mean ever since
Spencer was born?

32:16.230 --> 32:18.562
Did you know that peanut
allergies are 85% genetic?

32:18.600 --> 32:21.068
Spencer and Travis
both have one.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.237
So do a lot of people.

32:22.270 --> 32:23.237
Mrs. Branigan,

32:23.270 --> 32:25.033
we know Shelly had a baby.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.061
Her autopsy proved it.

32:27.110 --> 32:30.375
There are records at
St. Barnabas Hospital in Islip.

32:30.410 --> 32:31.377
That is not true.

32:31.410 --> 32:32.445
How can you
come into our home

32:32.480 --> 32:33.447
and say that?

32:33.480 --> 32:34.447
We have the records

32:34.480 --> 32:35.310
if you'd like to see them.

32:35.350 --> 32:36.510
Spencer is our son.

32:36.550 --> 32:38.040
JAMES:
Sandra.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.489
Stop.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.580
We can't keep
going on like this.

32:46.230 --> 32:48.391
You were right.

32:48.430 --> 32:51.194
Shelly had Spencer
when she was 15 years old.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.367
With Travis.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.662
Yeah.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.429
They were just kids.

32:55.470 --> 32:58.268
So we made a deal.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.301
Travis signed away
his parental rights,

33:00.340 --> 33:02.729
we adopted Spencer
and raised him as our own.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.649
You told us
you didn't even know Shelly.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.716
But the fact is,
you had a child with her.

33:11.750 --> 33:12.580
Why'd you lie?

33:12.620 --> 33:14.451
We slept together once
when we were 15.

33:14.490 --> 33:15.616
Once.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.252
It wasn't like we
had a relationship.

33:17.290 --> 33:18.689
Tell that to your son.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.755
Those were rough years.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.725
My mom was an alcoholic, and
my dad beat the crap out of us.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.194
When Sandra and Jim
offered to take Spencer,

33:26.230 --> 33:27.424
it seemed like a solution.

33:27.470 --> 33:30.166
At least he'd grow
up in a stable home.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.361
So you got
the hell out of Islip,

33:32.410 --> 33:34.275
changed your name,
came back a new man.

33:34.310 --> 33:35.572
I went to school.

33:35.610 --> 33:37.703
Worked my ass off and
made something of myself,

33:37.740 --> 33:38.968
if that's what you mean.

33:39.010 --> 33:41.274
Then Shelly found you again and
threatened to ruin everything.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.571
She wasn't looking for me.

33:44.390 --> 33:47.416
I ran_int_o her at Junior's
beginning of summer.

33:47.450 --> 33:48.348
First time in years.

33:48.390 --> 33:50.119
She told me about
her father's accident

33:50.160 --> 33:51.457
and said they were
strapped for cash,

33:51.490 --> 33:52.718
so I helped her out.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.456
With the $10,000
you withdrew from your account.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.060
I didn't have to give
her a cent, legally.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.465
I just felt bad for her.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.593
Or maybe you just wanted
to shut her up.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.200
If George Mortimer found out
you lied about who you were

34:04.240 --> 34:05.468
and you had
an eight year-old son,

34:05.510 --> 34:08.229
I doubt you'd still be the prize
catch for his precious daughter.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.204
Just because I fathered a child
at 15 doesn't mean I'm a killer.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.547
No, but it gives you motive.

34:12.580 --> 34:13.649
Maybe I should get a lavwer.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.274
Maybe.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.412
You were at the house,

34:17.450 --> 34:19.179
you had a relationship
with the victim,

34:19.220 --> 34:20.448
and you lied to us.

34:20.490 --> 34:21.514
It's not looking good.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.825
Look, we're gonna
find the person

34:24.860 --> 34:27.579
who sold you that new anchor,
and that's it, Travis,

34:27.630 --> 34:28.824
you're going away.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.523
Just a matter of time.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.604
All right.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.107
I did it.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.108
I killed Shelly, but
it was an accident.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.856
Tell me what happened.

34:56.890 --> 34:59.654
She showed up
at the party.

34:59.690 --> 35:02.898
Threatened to tell
Lizzy everything.

35:02.930 --> 35:05.865
Then she demanded
$50,000 to go away.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.595
I took her down to the boathouse

35:07.630 --> 35:09.336
to try to talk
some sense into her,

35:09.370 --> 35:11.509
but she wouldn't listen.

35:11.540 --> 35:13.360
She got violent.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.571
Came at me with a knife.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.549
I managed to get
it away from her.

35:22.550 --> 35:25.781
Next thing I knew, there
was blood everywhere.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.812
She was dead in,
like, three minutes.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.738
I don't buy it,
not for a second. Too easy.

35:44.770 --> 35:46.909
Yeah, I thought so, too.
So what's he doing?

35:46.940 --> 35:48.498
I don't. know.

35:48.540 --> 35:49.700
Yeah, Jay.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.469
Okay, I hit pay dirt.

35:51.510 --> 35:54.741
Nautical store in Medford
confirms they sold our anchor.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.543
Had the serial number
and everything.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.343
Manager said
the guy came in early.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.914
Was it Travis?

35:59.950 --> 36:01.850
Well, the clerk who sold it
is gone for the day.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.517
Manager's pretty fuzzy,
couldn't I.D. Travis's photos.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.824
But he remembers
the guy pulled a big wad of cash

36:05.860 --> 36:08.192
out of a money clip
when he paid for it.

36:08.230 --> 36:09.527
WOMAN:
The catering supervisor is

36:09.560 --> 36:11.460
the one that does
the hiring and firing.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.922
Thank you.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.437
WOMAN:
Hey, Bob?

36:17.470 --> 36:19.609
He and his brother Robbie used
to hang out at our house a lot.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.801
A scrimshaw money clip?

36:23.840 --> 36:24.875
JAY:
Uh, yeah, actually.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.309
Jay, do me a favor.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.377
Um, call the Fish Monger
over on-on Birch Road.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.581
There was a supervisor
there by the name of Bob.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.746
I need his full name.

36:33.790 --> 36:34.779
Copy that.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.516
What's Bob the supervisor
got to do with anything?

36:37.560 --> 36:38.686
He had a money clip.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.925
I saw him shucking oysters.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.292
Not so hard.
You're chewing it up.

36:43.330 --> 36:44.820
Here.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.758
Shelly was killed by
a three-inch blade

36:46.800 --> 36:47.892
with dull edges.

36:47.930 --> 36:48.897
Oyster knife.

36:48.940 --> 36:49.895
An oyster knife.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.305
That's our murder weapon.

36:52.740 --> 36:53.536
Yeah, Jay, go ahead.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.470
JAY:
Okay, you guys ready for this?

36:55.510 --> 36:57.933
Bob's full name
is Robert Harlow.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.470
As in Travis Harlow.

36:59.510 --> 37:02.570
So George Mortimer's
future son-in-law

37:02.620 --> 37:05.748
and Bob the oyster shucker
are brothers.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.542
That's why Travis
confessed so fast.

37:07.590 --> 37:08.682
He's protecting
his brother.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.382
He knows Robert did it, and he's
taking the fall for him.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.727
Well, what do we do with Travis?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.398
We just arrested him for murder.

37:14.430 --> 37:16.489
That's right.

37:16.530 --> 37:17.952
We just arrested him.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.865
Everyone knows big-city cops

37:19.900 --> 37:21.868
play fast and loose
with the rules.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.539
Looks like
you caught a break.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.309
Mr. Mortimer called in
a favor with Judge Addison.

37:38.350 --> 37:39.510
What happened?

37:39.550 --> 37:41.859
Those cops from the city
screwed up big-time.

37:41.890 --> 37:44.484
Continued asking you questions
after you asked for a lavwer.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.986
Got the whole thing on video.

37:46.030 --> 37:49.557
Addison took one look,
invalidated the arrest warrant.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.295
You're free to go.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.820
Just like that?

37:52.870 --> 37:55.862
Well, helps to have judges
who owe you favors, I guess.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.903
But I wouldn't go too
far if I were you.

38:03.540 --> 38:04.541
Seem like he bought it?

38:04.580 --> 38:06.571
Let's just hope
it works, right?

38:12.690 --> 38:13.884
Yeah, Murray?

38:13.920 --> 38:15.808
Phone tap
just intercepted a call

38:15.860 --> 38:17.418
from Travis
to his brother Robert.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.724
Told him to meet him at
the Marina in an hour.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.751
Travis has a boat out there, Al.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.792
They're gonna run.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.007
AL:
Subject just arrived.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.540
Exiting vehicle.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.445
He's carrying
a duffel bag.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.548
Copy that.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.785
Big brother's in the boatyard.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.084
What the hell is this?

38:52.130 --> 38:54.849
I thought we were
gonna make a plan.

38:54.900 --> 38:55.821
Yeah, this is the plan.

38:55.860 --> 38:58.920
Take the money, take
the boat, go somewhere.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.790
Don't come back. I brought
some clothes and stuff.

39:00.830 --> 39:01.990
No, come on, Travis.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.792
God, Robbie, why'd
you have to kill her?

39:03.840 --> 39:05.432
BOB:
I told you, bro,

39:05.470 --> 39:06.801
she was gonna take you down.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.432
Not enough;
he has to say it.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.435
All hold.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.936
TRAVIS:
So she wanted money.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.106
Big deal.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.948
A hundred grand?
That's a big deal to me.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.039
You told me 50.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.547
Whatever, 50, a hundred...

39:18.590 --> 39:19.841
Did_ she even
mention money?

39:19.890 --> 39:22.552
Travis, I know her kind
of people, our kind of people.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.057
She wanted one thing.
What did she say?

39:24.090 --> 39:26.888
She said she wanted
to talk to you, say good-bye.

39:26.930 --> 39:28.818
I knew what that meant.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.158
She knew I'd be heading
back to the city

39:31.200 --> 39:32.929
and we'd never _see
each other again.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.393
She didn't want to embarrass
me by coming by my house,

39:35.440 --> 39:37.590
so she came
to the party,

39:37.640 --> 39:39.904
where she knew there'd
be a million people,

39:39.940 --> 39:41.066
to say good-bye.

39:44.510 --> 39:46.808
I don't know.
A little late for theories.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.772
Get out of here. Now.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.082
And what are you gonna do?

39:52.120 --> 39:53.985
Even ifI disappear,
you can't talk to Lizzy!

39:54.020 --> 39:55.453
About what?!
You can't tell her!

39:55.490 --> 39:56.616
About what?!
About Shelly?!

39:56.660 --> 39:58.855
About my son?
I have to.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.824
She'll drop you before the words
are out of your mouth!

40:00.860 --> 40:02.691
I don't care.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.869
You can't, Travis! You...

40:04.900 --> 40:06.959
You're gonna throw it all away.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.537
All right, I screwed up.

40:09.570 --> 40:12.937
But everything I sacrificed
so that you could be somebody...

40:12.970 --> 40:14.938
I worked triple shifts
to put you through college!

40:14.980 --> 40:16.971
I know what you did.

40:17.010 --> 40:18.500
Listen to me.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.699
They got nothing.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.047
We're gonna get
our stories straight and...

40:21.080 --> 40:22.149
Good-bye, Robbie.
No, no, no.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.444
Listen, listen, listen.
All right, we can go together.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.445
I know a guy in Halifax.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.139
I'm staying, Robbie!

40:27.190 --> 40:28.817
Get over here!

40:28.860 --> 40:30.555
Get in the damn boat, Travis!

40:32.230 --> 40:33.720
You understand what I did?!

40:33.760 --> 40:34.852
I killed for you!

40:34.900 --> 40:35.924
I didn't ask you to!

40:35.960 --> 40:37.029
That's it, let's go!

40:37.060 --> 40:38.049
Go, go!

40:39.570 --> 40:40.628
All units, green light.

40:40.670 --> 40:41.989
Move in.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.701
You didn't ask me?!

40:47.740 --> 40:49.731
Huh!

40:50.680 --> 40:51.942
Police! Stop!

40:51.980 --> 40:53.675
AL:
Hands! Hands!

40:53.710 --> 40:54.938
CARRIE:
Get up! Now!

40:54.980 --> 40:57.915
Back up! Back up!

40:57.950 --> 41:01.716
OFFICER: All right,
keep your hands up!

41:01.760 --> 41:03.182
All right, I got him.

41:05.590 --> 41:08.923
Every day you asked me,
since you were a kid,

41:08.960 --> 41:10.655
"Help me."

41:10.700 --> 41:11.997
So I gave you a chance.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.567
All right, let's
go, pal. Come on.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.669
Good luck.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.509
OFFICER: Call it in.

41:24.580 --> 41:26.070
Well, uh, looks like it's back

41:26.110 --> 41:27.975
to confiscating
beach fireworks for me.

41:28.010 --> 41:30.046
I really enjoyed my
time with you guys.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.240
Likewise.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.508
Thank you.

41:32.550 --> 41:33.539
Hello.

41:33.590 --> 41:34.614
Oh, hey!

41:34.660 --> 41:35.979
Just checking in, making sure

41:36.020 --> 41:37.510
you people haven't
trashed my house.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.050
Well, it's still early, boss.

41:39.090 --> 41:42.696
I hear congratulations
are in order, so...

41:42.730 --> 41:45.096
I brought some
champagne... type substance

41:45.130 --> 41:47.018
from a local vineyard.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.662
Quite a place
you got here, Eliot.

41:48.700 --> 41:49.667
Thank you.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.236
AL:
Salt...

41:51.270 --> 41:55.536
Salt or no salt?

41:55.580 --> 41:57.070
Really?

41:57.110 --> 41:58.998
You don't remember?
What?

41:59.050 --> 42:01.200
That the last_ time
we had margaritas was

42:01.250 --> 42:03.172
October 23, 2002...

42:03.220 --> 42:05.040
No. No!

42:05.090 --> 42:06.114
...Winterfest,
Hanover Square?

42:06.150 --> 42:07.185
No, no, no, it wasn't.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.653
I know.

42:08.690 --> 42:10.089
My birthday party
at Diablo's last year.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.553
I'm just keeping you honest.

42:11.590 --> 42:13.057
Enjoy your salt.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.627
Thank you very much.

42:15.660 --> 42:18.629
You're thinking about Shelly,
aren't you?

42:18.670 --> 42:19.989
I don't know.

42:20.030 --> 42:22.191
She wanted to see the father
of her son move forward,

42:22.240 --> 42:24.765
get closure,
and it got her killed.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.766
Yeah.
What about Travis?

42:26.810 --> 42:29.028
What does he get,
obstruction, accessory?

42:29.080 --> 42:31.002
My guess is
the Mortimers will be very happy

42:31.040 --> 42:32.746
to have this all just go away.

42:32.780 --> 42:34.975
Yeah, my guess
is you're right.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.012
"His dream must have
seemed so close,

42:38.050 --> 42:40.211
that he could hardly fail
to grasp it."

42:40.250 --> 42:43.617
Gatsby.

42:43.660 --> 42:46.788
Ooh, not a story
that ends very well.

42:46.830 --> 42:47.956
Even

42:53.230 --> 42:55.130
JAY:
Oh, hey!

42:55.170 --> 42:56.194
Hey, I got a suggestion.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.663
Major Crimes should set up
a Long Island division.

42:58.710 --> 42:59.859
From June to Labor Day.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.104
Hear, hear!

43:01.140 --> 43:02.107
I'll drink to that.

43:02.140 --> 43:03.676
Whoa.

43:03.710 --> 43:05.075
You guys, let's get a picture.
Let's do this.

43:05.110 --> 43:06.702
Let's... Here, Jay,
come over here.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.069
Yeah, good, perfect.
Stay right...

43:08.110 --> 43:09.919
Great, yeah, stay put.
AL:
Picture time, Carrie.

43:09.950 --> 43:11.679
Come on, let's get in here.
Ready, guys? Squeeze in.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.039
Hey, guys, get
in the shot.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.148
All right, ready?

43:14.190 --> 43:15.748
And one, two, three.

43:15.790 --> 43:16.984
Smile.
And...

43:17.020 --> 43:18.749
ALL:
Cheers!
