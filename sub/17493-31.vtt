00:16.040 --> 00:19.840
It's an autumn afternoon, and Sarah
and Duck are in the garden,

00:19.840 --> 00:22.880
making a path

It's Boo Night.
SQUAWK

00:58.240 --> 01:02.120
It's a day when you dress up, and
if you make someone jump, you can

01:02.120 --> 01:03.640
ask then for a Boo sweet.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.240
Sounds reasonable.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.640
Ooh.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.920

Oh, yeah.

Oh, dear.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.400
Sorry, Bug.
