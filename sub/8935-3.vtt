WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:01.301
ergreen Forest.

00:03.870 --> 00:06.239
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.943
That is, until Bert
Raccoon wakes up.

00:09.943 --> 00:13.046
Yahoo!

00:14.280 --> 00:16.816
Yee-ha!

00:16.816 --> 00:18.218
Yipe!

00:18.218 --> 00:19.352
Oof!

00:24.224 --> 00:25.859
Luckily,
he has some good friends

00:25.859 --> 00:27.027
to help him out.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.903
Life would be simple in
the Forest except for:

00:38.138 --> 00:43.109
Cyril Sneer.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.413
And his life would
be simple except for:

00:46.413 --> 00:48.048
the Raccoons!

01:02.495 --> 01:05.131
When a new family moves
to the Evergreen Forest,

01:05.131 --> 01:07.200
it's cause for a celebration.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.636
And of course, no
party would be complete

01:09.636 --> 01:11.871
without Bert Raccoon.

01:11.871 --> 01:14.841
Hey, there's a lot
more out here, you guys!

01:14.841 --> 01:16.342
Not to worry, Nicole.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.711
We'll have you
unpacked in no time.

01:18.711 --> 01:22.215
Oh, my aching sacroiliac.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.818
I thought losing
my job was painful.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.419
Moving is worse!

01:26.419 --> 01:28.621
And standing still
won't get it done.

01:28.621 --> 01:29.856
Come on, big brother.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.191
Time's a-wasting.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.960
Gangway! Fragile
material coming through.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.628
Whoa!

01:35.628 --> 01:37.363
Interception!

01:37.363 --> 01:40.166
Pretty
good stunt, eh, George?

01:40.166 --> 01:42.068
Hey, how about a guest shot

01:42.068 --> 01:44.170
on that new TV show of yours?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.538
Give me a break, Bert.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.707
I haven't even started
my new job yet.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.509
Besides, there's not much call

01:49.509 --> 01:51.911
for daredevils on a
cooking show, Bert.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.513
Oh, I dunno.

01:53.513 --> 01:57.217
I could introduce a new recipe:

01:57.217 --> 01:59.385
"Dare-deviled eggs" (chortles).

02:00.520 --> 02:01.788
That sounds about right,

02:01.788 --> 02:03.456
coming from a canned ham.

02:04.390 --> 02:06.659
Fine, fine, I can take a hint.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.795
Are Bentley and
Lisa still upstairs?

02:08.795 --> 02:11.865
Yes, they're
still wheeling and dealing

02:11.865 --> 02:13.800
over who gets which bedroom.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.237
Oh, wait 'til Bentley
sees what I got him.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.340
An official Mammoth
Mudhens baseball cap!

02:21.508 --> 02:23.209
You always
get everything you want!

02:23.209 --> 02:25.211
And you're
acting like a big baby.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.480
Fine! Take the stupid room.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.083
See if I care!

02:30.083 --> 02:31.718
Uh, Bentley?

02:32.952 --> 02:34.387
And don't you dare
come back in here!

02:34.387 --> 02:36.589
Uh-uh-uh,
L-L-Lisa?

02:37.857 --> 02:39.492
I wish I still had
my old room, anyway.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.194
And I wish we'd
never even moved.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.830
So there!

02:43.830 --> 02:47.167
Sheesh, I wish I'd
stayed downstairs.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.206
In days of old,

02:53.206 --> 02:54.674
when there were no laws,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.543
Who did we count on?

02:56.543 --> 02:59.612
"Three
Guys With a Cause"!

02:59.612 --> 03:00.813
That's right, kiddies.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.549
Now, stay tuned to,

03:04.584 --> 03:07.086
Biff, Phil, and Alphonse:

03:07.086 --> 03:09.656
"Three Guys With a Cause",

03:09.656 --> 03:11.958
right here on K.N.O.X. TV.

03:13.459 --> 03:14.894
Oh, boy.

03:14.894 --> 03:19.599
I wish we had a life of
swash-buckling and derring-do.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.868
Yeah,
with the boss around,

03:21.868 --> 03:23.937
it's all buckling-down
and derring-don't.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.608
"You're cordially invited

03:28.608 --> 03:33.613
to visit my new television
facility, K.N.O.X. TV.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.450
Sincerely Yours, Mr. Knox."

03:37.450 --> 03:38.418
Fat chance.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.320
I'd sooner eat worms.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.690
Pigs! I've got something
else for you boys to shred.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.058
Will do, Boss.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.359
Put it on the pile.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.729
What was that, Boss?

03:51.698 --> 03:55.668
B-b-boys, I-I think
we're-we're done for!

03:56.603 --> 03:58.171
Ah! Ooh! Ai-ee!

03:58.171 --> 04:00.807
And if I ever see you three
thickheaded throwbacks again,

04:00.807 --> 04:03.276
I'll make you the main
attractions in a luau!

04:03.276 --> 04:05.278
And you won't be
wearing grass skirts.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.614
Show them to the gate, Snag.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.383
No, no!

04:15.922 --> 04:17.390
Hey, Lisa, look at this.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.459
They're giving away a
genuine Mudman Whirly-Bird

04:19.459 --> 04:20.660
in the Crackle Crunch.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.829
Sorry, Bentley,
it's not on the list.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.198
I never get anything I want.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.699
Aw, Lisa.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.003
It's only one measly
box of cereal.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.738
Until Dad starts his new job,

04:31.738 --> 04:33.640
we're on a tight budget.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.108
Poor little guy.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.177
All these changes
must be tough on 'im.

04:38.177 --> 04:41.014
Yeah, "poor little Bentley".

04:41.914 --> 04:43.316
Hello, boys.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.717
What can I do for you?

04:44.717 --> 04:46.819
I'm glad you
asked, Mr. Willow.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.855
As a result of recent cutbacks,

04:48.855 --> 04:53.626
we find ourselves available
for gainful employment.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.028
But we'd settle for a job.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.631
Well, I guess I
could use a trio

04:58.631 --> 05:00.667
of hardworking pack boys-

05:00.667 --> 05:01.901
Pack boys!

05:01.901 --> 05:04.037
Ha. We were hoping for something

05:04.037 --> 05:05.938
in the executive
management field

05:05.938 --> 05:07.173
at about 40K.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.678
Well, have you
tried the Want Ads?

05:11.678 --> 05:15.315
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. Willow.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.519
Bentley, what are you
doing in these parts?

05:19.519 --> 05:22.622
Bentley and Lisa just moved
to the Forest, Mr. Willow.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.590
Isn't that grand!

05:24.590 --> 05:27.994
Bentley, you're going to
have a great time here.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.829
Uh, you too, Lisa.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.732
I see you're a
Mudhens fan, Bentley.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.367
What do you think of their
chances for the pennant?

05:34.367 --> 05:35.368
I think they'll take it.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.669
With Roland Nylon pitching,

05:36.669 --> 05:37.904
they can't lose!

05:37.904 --> 05:40.573
Uh, I'm a pretty
big basketball fan.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.742
Aw, gee, that's too bad, Lisa.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.044
There's no basketball
teams in the Forest.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.513
I figure the Diamondbacks
are the only threat

05:47.513 --> 05:48.548
the Mudhens have.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.782
Those wimps?

05:49.782 --> 05:51.718
Ha! No way.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.753
Not since they
traded Pony Fernando.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.622
Yeah, but they brought
up that new southpaw,

05:56.622 --> 05:58.291
Milk Can Floyd.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.626
Ah, he's a
designated do-nothing.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.196
It's
too good to be true!

06:03.196 --> 06:05.264
I call it fate.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.600
Well,
what are we waiting for?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.736
The perfect job awaits.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.070
Oh-hoo, yes!

06:14.340 --> 06:17.610
Where in tarnation did
those disorganized drips

06:17.610 --> 06:19.612
file the Bosco papers?

06:19.612 --> 06:21.447
Pigs! Front and,

06:22.315 --> 06:23.182
center.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.517
Hi, Pop.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.085
Pigs got the day off?

06:26.085 --> 06:27.820
Who? Oh, right.

06:27.820 --> 06:28.654
The Pigs (chortles).

06:28.654 --> 06:30.123
I fired them.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.358
Should have done it years ago.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.260
You're kidding, right, Pop?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.194
Kidding?

06:35.194 --> 06:36.829
Why I should have fired them

06:36.829 --> 06:39.298
before they messed
up my filing system.

06:39.298 --> 06:42.468
Uh, maybe it's not too
late to get them back, Pop.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.872
If you think I'd take those
goldbricking galoots back

06:45.872 --> 06:48.708
then your calculator
needs batteries, Cedric.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.543
Now, if you'll excuse me, son,

06:50.543 --> 06:52.211
I'm kind of busy.

06:52.211 --> 06:56.549
Bosco, Bosco, where is
that dang blasted file?

06:58.050 --> 07:01.721
"To the best boss in the world."

07:01.721 --> 07:03.055
Gosh.

07:03.055 --> 07:08.060
Yeech! I've told those
idiots a million times:

07:08.060 --> 07:11.097
No jelly sandwiches
in the office!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.799
But Mr. Knox,

07:12.799 --> 07:15.134
I moved my whole
family to the Forest

07:15.134 --> 07:16.869
on the strength of your letter.

07:16.869 --> 07:20.206
Well, that's very
unfortunate, sir.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.609
All I said was I'd
like to try you out

07:23.609 --> 07:26.145
as the host of "Chef Surprise".

07:26.145 --> 07:27.346
Now see here, Mr. Knox-

07:27.346 --> 07:28.481
Hold on, Ralph.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.849
I'll handle this.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.418
So you're telling me
this is a trial period?

07:32.418 --> 07:33.619
Exactly.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.489
If your ratings are
good on the first show,

07:36.489 --> 07:40.526
I'd be more than happy
to offer you a contract.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.361
Don't worry, sir.

07:42.361 --> 07:46.365
I'm sure things'll
work out just fine.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.435
Now if you'll excuse me.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.271
Aw, don't worry
about it, George.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.473
You'll get the job.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.308
And what if I don't?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.543
How can I tell
Nicole and the kids?

07:57.543 --> 07:58.511
I've uprooted them,

07:58.511 --> 08:00.012
taken the kids out of school,

08:00.012 --> 08:02.114
brought them to a strange place.

08:02.114 --> 08:05.184
And now I'm not even
sure I've got a job.

08:05.184 --> 08:07.887
Sure made a mess of things
this time, Ralphie old boy.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.323
A real mess.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.427
I must confess,

08:14.427 --> 08:19.432
I was unaware you three were
trained actors and stuntmen.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.468
Ah, y-you wouldn't
believe some of the stunts

08:22.468 --> 08:25.004
we've pulled, uh, Mr. Knox, sir.

08:25.004 --> 08:29.375
Well, I certainly hope
your audition works out.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.778
It would give me great
pleasure to hire away

08:32.778 --> 08:36.516
three of Mr. Sneer's employees.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.384
In fact, I dunno how
you managed to work

08:38.384 --> 08:41.954
for such a money-grubbing
slave driver for this long.

08:41.954 --> 08:44.991
You can't talk about
our boss that way.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.058
I (elbow thumps) ow.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.127
Uh, our, uh, ex-boss.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.730
Yeah, um, uh, well,

08:50.730 --> 08:54.267
he could be difficult
at times (chortles).

08:54.267 --> 08:55.968
By the way, um,

08:55.968 --> 08:58.971
what happened to the
last, uh, "Three Guys"?

08:58.971 --> 09:00.139
Huh?

09:00.139 --> 09:02.742
Oh, a couple of
months in a body cast

09:02.742 --> 09:05.077
and they'll be right as rain.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.246
Well, let's get on
with it, shall we?

09:07.246 --> 09:10.383
Okay, boys, action!

09:16.289 --> 09:19.492
I think you boys are
gonna work out just peachy.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.295
I was
afraid he'd say that.

09:23.663 --> 09:26.666
Oh, everything's
fine, I guess.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.301
I'm popping over to
the Raccoondominium.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.669
Want to come along?

09:29.669 --> 09:30.736
No, thanks, Mom.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.238
Have fun.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.606
Sorry about that.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.808
Uh, how's the basketball
team doing without me?

09:36.776 --> 09:38.411
They won?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.414
Gee, that's-that's great.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.381
You have to go?

09:42.381 --> 09:43.449
Oh no, no.

09:43.449 --> 09:44.917
I've got lots to do.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.586
Say hi to everybody for me.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.654
'bye.

09:48.654 --> 09:49.889
We're off to the
ballgame, Lisa.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.390
Wanna come?

09:51.390 --> 09:52.925
No thanks, Bentley.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.560
I still have to
unpack some stuff.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.696
You know, Bert, I think
living in the Forest

09:56.696 --> 09:59.198
is gonna suit me just fine.

09:59.198 --> 10:01.233
Yeah, just fine.

Bosco, Bosco, it's got
to be in here somewhere.

11:57.116 --> 11:58.984
I don't know what's worse:

11:58.984 --> 12:01.454
living with the Pigs
or living without them.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.155
I hate computers!

12:05.391 --> 12:07.827
Pop, you'll never
guess what's on TV!

12:07.827 --> 12:10.429
A vast wasteland, I suppose.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.697
Watch this.

12:11.697 --> 12:12.832
In days of old,

12:12.832 --> 12:14.233
when there were no laws,

12:14.233 --> 12:15.968
who did we count on?

12:17.403 --> 12:20.206
"Three Guys With a Cause"!

12:20.206 --> 12:24.510
Bob, Alphonse,
the king's men pursueth me.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.446
Uh, quickly, Biff,

12:27.446 --> 12:31.584
lest their approach signal
our ultimate (screams).

12:31.584 --> 12:33.886
Aren't the Pigs great, Pop?

12:33.886 --> 12:34.954
And to think,

12:34.954 --> 12:36.922
we knew them way back when.

12:38.124 --> 12:43.062
I-I'm really happy for
them, son, really happy.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.098
They seem to be doing
just fine without me.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.404
Bentley seems
to be having fun.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.474
He and Bert are cooking up
all kinds of things to do.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.843
I wish I could settle
in as easily as the kids.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.378
I mean, look at Lisa.

12:59.378 --> 13:01.947
She acts like she's lived in
the Forest all her life, huh.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.182
Well, that's Lisa.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.384
She's always been so popular.

13:05.384 --> 13:08.187
I guess she knows she'll
have no problem fitting in.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.189
Yeah, but I might.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.423
About the job, Nicole.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.458
Do you think I should tell them?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.592
Tell them what?

13:13.592 --> 13:14.794
Oh, Lisa.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.562
Ah, this is a
little tough honey,

13:16.562 --> 13:19.465
but, uh, I saw Mr. Knox, and-

13:19.465 --> 13:20.833
What your father's
trying to say

13:20.833 --> 13:24.270
is the job isn't guaranteed.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.372
Let's just keep this
to ourselves for now.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.207
I don't want Bentley to worry.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.041
Okay, honey?

13:29.041 --> 13:31.177
Bert, Bentley!

13:31.177 --> 13:32.511
Dinner's almost ready!

13:32.511 --> 13:33.412
Be right there!

13:34.713 --> 13:36.916
Wait 'til Lisa sees
this, little buddy.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.417
She's gonna love it!

13:38.417 --> 13:40.653
Professor Smedley-Smythe
thinks there might be a job

13:40.653 --> 13:41.887
for me at the museum.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.523
And I think azaleas
would be nice out front.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.225
I'll ask Lady
Baden-Baden about it.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.627
You remember the time
Old Man Brothers caught us

13:48.627 --> 13:49.428
in the orchard?

13:49.428 --> 13:50.830
He caught you, George.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.232
I was always the fast
one in our family.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.001
And then we can go
camping up on Freen's Peak.

13:56.001 --> 14:00.239
Oh, and wait 'til you see
the Endless Echo Caverns!

14:00.239 --> 14:01.507
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.376
I've gotta show you
my baseball cards.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.911
You're not sayin' much, Lisa.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.713
Uh, how was your day?

14:07.713 --> 14:10.182
Lousy, as if you care.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.550
What's wrong, Lisa?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.252
Everything!
Everything's wrong.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.553
I've got no friends anymore,

14:14.553 --> 14:15.788
I miss my school,

14:15.788 --> 14:16.722
I hate this house!

14:16.722 --> 14:17.990
That's enough, young lady!

14:17.990 --> 14:19.859
We've all got a lot
of adjusting to do.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.693
Oh, sure.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.961
Everyone else is happy.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.696
Nobody cares what I think!

14:23.696 --> 14:24.897
None of this would have happened

14:24.897 --> 14:26.398
if you hadn't have
lost your job.

14:26.398 --> 14:29.101
Lisa!

14:29.101 --> 14:30.603
It's all your fault!

14:30.603 --> 14:33.706
And I hope you don't get that
stupid job at the station!

14:37.977 --> 14:39.411
How's Lisa doing?

14:39.411 --> 14:41.380
She won't talk to us.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.415
Maybe she just needs some time.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.752
Hmm, you mind if I
take a whack at it?

14:46.752 --> 14:48.120
It can't hurt.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.488
Maybe she'll listen to you.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.061
And Bert breaks
out of the pack, and wham-o!

14:56.061 --> 14:57.897
Slam dunk!

14:57.897 --> 15:00.466
And it's a swisher from
the three-point line!

15:02.501 --> 15:03.903
Hiya, Lisa.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.304
Hey, watch me.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.239
You might learn something
about the fine art

15:07.239 --> 15:08.574
of slam-dunkin'.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.143
Whoa, argh!

15:11.143 --> 15:13.712
Lisa?

15:19.818 --> 15:23.022
Wah! Oof!

15:24.990 --> 15:28.560
You can't teach me a thing
about basketball, buster.

15:32.831 --> 15:37.603
But-but, did, uh, oof!

15:59.658 --> 16:00.893
Whew!

16:00.893 --> 16:03.329
You must have won the
high school championship

16:03.329 --> 16:04.863
all by yourself.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.465
Don't be silly, Bert.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.934
Basketball has to
be a team effort.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.404
Oh, kind of like
a family, right?

16:12.404 --> 16:14.673
Yeah, exactly like a...

16:15.607 --> 16:18.310
Yeah, a lot like a family, Bert.

16:19.678 --> 16:22.214
"Three Guys With a Cause",

16:22.214 --> 16:25.451
Scene 10, Take 13.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.722
Thirteenth try
lucky, eh boys?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.661
No, no, no!

16:36.795 --> 16:40.532
You're supposed to
land in the hay cart!

16:40.532 --> 16:42.735
In the hay cart!

16:42.735 --> 16:46.205
Oh, believe me, Mr.
Knox, we're trying.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.573
We're trying.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.108
That's it.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.910
If you boys can't provide
the sort of action I need-

16:51.910 --> 16:53.345
Ahem.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.714
Why, Mr. Sneer.

16:56.815 --> 17:00.185
I'm so glad you
accepted my invitation

17:00.185 --> 17:03.222
to visit my extensive studio.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.556
It's the Boss.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.259
Maybe
he wants us back.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.560
Dream on.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.563
that part of our lives
is over and done with,

17:11.563 --> 17:13.599
and we might as well face it.

17:15.067 --> 17:19.038
So (clears throat) the Pigs
giving you a hard time, Knox?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.672
Boil my grits.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.174
No, sir.

17:22.174 --> 17:26.278
They are exemplary employees.

17:26.278 --> 17:29.081
Come and say hello
to my "Three Guys".

17:30.516 --> 17:34.586
Ooh, uh, they might even
deign to sign an autograph.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.223
Wouldn't
that be a thrill.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.324
Three Xs.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.794
Hi, Boss! Uh, Cyril.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.195
Hello, boys.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.229
How are things?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.998
Hunky dory, Boss.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.234
We're having the time
of our lives, thanks.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.836
That's great, boys!

17:50.836 --> 17:54.006
Um, (coughs) you-you
left these behind.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.375
Oh, Boss.

17:56.375 --> 18:00.145
I-I thought you
might want them.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.548
Our bunny-wunnies!

18:02.548 --> 18:06.618
I know you always liked
your, uh, bunny-wunnies.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.220
All
right, we're not

18:08.220 --> 18:10.222
shooting a soap opera, here.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.157
Places, everyone.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.461
Uh, would you like to
stick around and watch?

18:15.461 --> 18:17.729
Sure. Thanks, I will.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.065
Camera Three,
zoom in on that logo.

18:21.733 --> 18:22.734
Aw, Nicole.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.036
What if I bomb?

18:24.036 --> 18:25.270
What if I don't get the job?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.306
I wish none of this
had ever happened.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.275
Well, it did happen
and we'll get through it.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.847
We're all going to be out
there rooting for you, George.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.781
Hi, Mom.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.715
Hi, guys.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.451
Oh, I wish Lisa had come.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.919
Me, too.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.754
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

18:42.754 --> 18:44.723
it's time for
everybody's soon-to-be

18:44.723 --> 18:48.994
fabulously favorite cooking
show, "Chef Surprise",

18:48.994 --> 18:52.931
starring George Raccoon!

18:52.931 --> 18:54.933
Good afternoon, folks.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.638
And
welcome to the show.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.374
Battering
ram sequence, Take One.

19:02.374 --> 19:06.278
Action!

19:12.851 --> 19:16.155
Ahem. Headache,
Knox?

19:16.155 --> 19:19.191
And to
celebrate my first show,

19:19.191 --> 19:22.528
Every audience member can
take home one of these pies.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.863
But first, we'll just finish up

19:24.863 --> 19:28.233
our chocolate cherry
cheesecake supreme.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.435
By the way, this is my
daughter's favorite.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.605
Well, would a member
of our studio audience

19:33.605 --> 19:36.241
care to sample it?

19:36.241 --> 19:37.576
I will!

19:39.211 --> 19:40.679
Lisa!

19:40.679 --> 19:41.947
I'm sorry, Daddy.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.215
Aww.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.750
Fellas,
fellas, in this one,

19:44.750 --> 19:48.320
you're trying to get away
from the king's men, okay?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.454
Hit it!

19:51.957 --> 19:53.325
Whoa!

19:53.325 --> 19:56.595
No, no, you
pea-brained pork bellies!

20:01.033 --> 20:03.569
Mm, this is the best-

20:07.406 --> 20:09.041
You're fired!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.142
Ya hear me?

20:10.142 --> 20:14.479
Fired!

20:15.314 --> 20:16.515
Take that, sir!

20:16.515 --> 20:17.816
Oof!

20:17.816 --> 20:18.650
Ha-ha!

20:18.650 --> 20:20.452
What's going on, here?

20:20.452 --> 20:21.553
Bombs away!

20:22.888 --> 20:25.724
Oh, George, your show,
c'est (pie splats) ooh!

20:27.192 --> 20:28.026
Oh!

20:30.195 --> 20:30.996
Well, you can't
say I didn't try.

20:30.996 --> 20:31.863
More pies, sir?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.933
Ha-ha, I haven't
had this much fun

20:34.933 --> 20:36.969
since my last tax refund.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.637
We-we make a pretty good team,

20:38.637 --> 20:40.539
r-right, Boss?

20:40.539 --> 20:42.441
I've seen worse.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.178
Uh, Boss, about that little
accident with the shredder?

20:46.178 --> 20:49.214
It's coming out
of your salary.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.616
You mean,

20:50.616 --> 20:53.752
we can have our old jobs back?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.220
Might as well.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.089
I wouldn't wish you
three messed-up meatballs

20:57.089 --> 20:59.458
on anyone else, heh!

20:59.458 --> 21:02.628
Stay tuned, folks, for
more "Chef Surprise".

21:05.664 --> 21:07.799
It takes
courage to face the future

21:07.799 --> 21:09.601
when you leave your past behind.

21:10.636 --> 21:11.570
For a while,

21:11.570 --> 21:13.038
Lisa didn't know where to look

21:13.038 --> 21:14.506
for the strength she needed,

21:14.506 --> 21:17.342
until Bert Raccoon
helped her find it:

21:17.342 --> 21:18.577
in her family.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.379
It looks pretty
official to me!

21:20.379 --> 21:22.514
After that
double-dip disaster,

21:22.514 --> 21:26.251
I still can't believe Mr.
Knox gave me the contract.

21:26.251 --> 21:29.988
Well, the show is called
"Chef Surprise", Dad.

21:29.988 --> 21:33.558
Welcome to the
Evergreen Forest!

21:34.493 --> 21:37.029
Gangway! Here comes the pie!
