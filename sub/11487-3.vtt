00:20.440 --> 00:22.112
Will you please stop that?

00:22.320 --> 00:24.550
l got a piece of popcorn stuck
in my teeth.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.029
-So go brush them.
-l brushed them this morning.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.556
-So go floss them.
-Oh, gross.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.156
Wait. l got it.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.879
No, that's chicken.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.596
When did we have chicken?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.552
You didn't brush this morning,
did you?

00:41.760 --> 00:45.639
Between you and me,
l lost my toothbrush three days ago.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.232
Still good.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.033
Hey, have you met any of the ladies
my dad's been dating?

00:57.200 --> 00:59.589
-No. You?
-No.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.952
More chicken?

01:05.120 --> 01:06.792
Fingernail.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.238
Yours?

01:10.680 --> 01:12.398
l hope so.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.829
So how come l don't get to meet
Dad's dates?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.434
l don't know,
maybe because you're disgusting.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.474
No, come on, really.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.234
l'm not kidding. For most women,
you're a deal breaker.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.516
You used to say l was a babe magnet.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.716
You used to be little and cute.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.954
Now you're just old and in the way.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.595
That's very hurtful, Uncle Charlie.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.270
The truth is your dad doesn't want you
to get attached to these women. . .

01:42.440 --> 01:44.271
. . .in case the relationship
doesn't work.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.429
Why?

01:45.600 --> 01:48.194
He loves you very much
and he cares about your feelings.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.793
You let me meet your dates.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.999
And what does that tell you?

01:54.640 --> 01:55.629
l have no idea.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.869
Hello?

02:12.440 --> 02:13.953
Hi, Dad.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.072
What are you doing up so late?
Charlie, what is he doing up?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.472
He's asleep.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.278
Oh, l'm sorry.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.715
-Charlie.
-What?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.474
Oh, hey, Alan.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.312
What is he doing up so late?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.233
l told him to go to bed.
How many times did l tell you?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.072
Boy, l lost count.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.479
See?

02:34.640 --> 02:36.551
-So how was your date?
-lt was fine.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.392
Did you get any?

02:42.680 --> 02:46.036
-Did l get any what?
-Hang on.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.394
What's he supposed to get?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.710
l swear l don't know
what he's talking about.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.472
Go to bed.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.393
-What are you teaching him?
-What difference does it make?

02:59.560 --> 03:02.472
The only thing he retains
is little shards of chicken.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.229
Wonderful.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.595
So did you get any?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.756
A nice evening.
We had a lovely dinner.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.512
For the record, a lovely dinner. . .

03:11.680 --> 03:13.796
. . .doesn't necessarily preclude
carpet burns. . .

03:13.960 --> 03:15.393
. . .and a bite mark on your ass.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.313
ln this case, it was just dinner
and pleasant conversation.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.517
Well, that's why God gave us
Cinemax and an opposable thumb.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.278
Good evening.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.594
Alan, the kid was asking about these
women you've been going out with.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.079
Why he never meets them.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.878
Really? What did you tell him?

03:35.040 --> 03:37.554
l said it's probably
because he's disgusting.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.039
Oh, Charlie--

03:39.200 --> 03:42.510
l also told him that you love him,
you don't want him to get attached. . .

03:42.680 --> 03:44.477
. . .be disappointed
if things don't work.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.629
Good. Thank you.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.155
But how come
l don't get to meet them?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.799
Because you're disgusting.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.789
That's very hurtful, Alan.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.232
Come on, really.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.994
What's the big secret
with these women?

03:59.160 --> 04:00.912
Boy, l really don't wanna get into it.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.559
-They're hideous, right?
-No.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.473
-lnsufferable? lnflatable?
-No.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.752
-Are you insane?
-lnsane. Are they insane?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.239
-Leave me alone.
-Come on, give me a hint.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.799
When you go to pick them up. . .

04:14.960 --> 04:17.154
. . .do you need a Border collie
to cut them off?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.029
Stop it.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.158
l'm never gonna stop, Alan.
You know me better than that.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.476
Okay, fine. l'll tell you.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.790
First of all, there's no women.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.111
lmaginary. My next guess
was gonna be imaginary.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.796
Let me finish.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.309
lt's just one woman.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.391
l've been seeing the same woman
for weeks.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.199
-l see. You've been playing it slow.
-Yes.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.191
And by slow l mean gay.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.916
l can't talk to you about this.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.390
Alan, you hook a fish
and play it too long.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.596
You know what
you have when you reel it in?

04:50.760 --> 04:53.911
-What?
-A tired fish that thinks you're gay.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.070
Do you drink
while you're babysitting my son?

04:57.240 --> 04:59.117
Not at first, but he wears me down.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.515
-So, what's the deal with this broad?
-She's not a broad.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.753
lt's Judith.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.151
-Your ex-wife?
-Yep.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.112
Okay, okay. That's not fair.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.158
You said no to insufferable
and insane.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.115
-Very funny.
-Are you serious?

05:19.280 --> 05:22.238
And by serious l mean dumber
than a bag of doorknobs.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.277
Look, we went out
to dinner weeks ago. . .

05:24.440 --> 05:26.670
. . .to talk about getting Jake
into middle school.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.434
Before you know it, we're laughing,
having a great time.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.639
l can see the humor in trying to get
the little bonehead into a good school.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.234
But that doesn't mean you start
dating your ex-wife.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.119
l know what you're thinking.
l'm being naive and romantic.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.475
Not even close.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.717
You can't overlook the fact
that we still have a lot in common.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.394
Yeah, neither of you
have any respect for you.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.473
The point is, she wants to give it
another try and so do l.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.598
We can't let Jake know, we don't
want him to get his hopes up.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.555
Oh, buddy, why don't you just take
an electric sander to your testicles?

06:03.640 --> 06:06.074
We're both adults,
we're aware of the pitfalls. . .

06:06.240 --> 06:08.754
. . .and we think it's worth the risk.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.229
Okay, fine. l wish you both
nothing but happiness.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.469
Thank you.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.034
Hello.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.077
Hello.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.955
What's going on?

06:39.120 --> 06:42.476
Sit down, Alan. We need to talk.

06:42.680 --> 06:47.993
Yeah, well, listen, l'd love to but
l've gotta wake up Jake so we can--

06:50.320 --> 06:52.197
Let him sleep.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.758
Am l getting whacked?

06:55.960 --> 06:59.191
lt was discussed,
but l was overruled.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.512
Sit down.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.354
Alan, we're all here
because we love you.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.910
And we don't wanna see you
make a terrible mistake.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.754
l'm just waiting
for my toaster strudel to pop.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.357
There we go.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.749
You told on me.

07:24.960 --> 07:29.431
Hey, you wouldn't listen to reason,
so now you're gonna listen to Mom.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.631
Alan, sweetheart, you know,
l only want the best for you, right?

07:36.320 --> 07:38.151
l do.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.956
l do.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.990
Which is why when Judith threw
you out, l was there supporting you.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.958
-You had other options?
-Don't be naive.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.758
l could have sucked up to Judith. . .

07:50.920 --> 07:53.036
. . .in order to have more access
to my grandson.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.111
But no, l burned that bridge.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.238
l said horrible things to her
that l can never take back.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.551
Keep in mind, this is a woman who
worked the phrase ''mousy bitch'' . . .

08:01.720 --> 08:03.517
. . .into her wedding toast.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.029
So if you two reconcile,
l'll have to apologize to her.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.954
-So?
-l'd rather kill us all.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.359
Okay, moving on.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.676
Rose? Do you have something
you'd like to say?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.956
Yes, thank you.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.472
Alan, when l first met you,
l didn't care for you at all.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.200
You were a fussy, whiny control freak.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.628
Yes? And now?

08:39.280 --> 08:41.350
Now it doesn't bother me so much.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.749
l think what Rose means is that
since the divorce, you've grown. . .

08:46.920 --> 08:48.399
. . .you've been reborn.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.715
That's not what l meant.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.348
lf that was what l meant,
that's what l would've said.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.917
-Sorry.
-Yeah, you'll get your turn.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.638
Okay.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.437
Alan, life is all about moving on.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.229
Now, in the animal kingdom,
sharks move forward. . .

09:06.400 --> 09:08.391
. . .while crabs move sideways.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.233
So the question you have to ask
yourself is:

09:11.400 --> 09:14.233
Are you a shark or a crab?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.593
Which way do Sea-Monkeys move?

09:22.400 --> 09:23.469
Okay, that's Judith.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.835
Now, l thank you for your concern. . .

09:26.000 --> 09:28.639
. . .but l would appreciate it
if nobody said anything. . .

09:28.800 --> 09:30.791
. . .and everybody just stayed out of it.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.433
Yeah, right.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.675
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey. Why aren't you dressed?

09:38.840 --> 09:42.116
l told you l was picking him up early.
Why isn't he ready? Get dressed.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.872
-l'm sorry.
-You're always sorry. . .

09:44.040 --> 09:45.871
. . .but l always play the bad guy.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.429
-Damn it, Alan.
-Okay, he's gone.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.239
-l was thinking about you last night.
-Really?

09:51.400 --> 09:54.198
-What were you thinking?
-Just what a nice time l had.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.679
Yes, yes, it was.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.829
Alan?

10:11.920 --> 10:13.751
Turn around.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.799
Hi, Judith.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.471
Hello. How are you?

10:18.640 --> 10:19.675
Fine.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.033
Bye, Dad. Bye, everybody.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.633
Bye, Jake.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.752
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.710
-Thanks for staying out of it.
-You're welcome.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.913
Hey, Alan. Come on out,
l got a surprise for you.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.152
Can it wait? Jake forgot
his math book. l'll run it to Judith's.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.151
No, no, no.
You can't go to Judith's.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.799
The surprise is ready now.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.558
Okay. What is it?

10:52.800 --> 10:53.994
Oh, for God's sake.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.549
Wait, there's more.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.988
Twins, Alan. l got them for you,
but you can share if you want.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.832
Charlie, no.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.991
Fine, you can have them both.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.913
Bad luck to split sisters anyway.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.792
l don't want them.
l'm going to Judith's.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.235
l don't think you're getting
the full picture.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.595
Turn around.
Show him the full picture.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.156
That's daily Pilates classes
and one meal a month.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.991
-l'll see you later.
-Are you sure?

11:30.160 --> 11:32.799
Even together, these girls aren't
as old as your ex-wife.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.359
Bye.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.158
Oh, for the love of God.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.796
Stop turning.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.752
Show's over.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.873
-lsn't he adorable?
-Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.679
When he's sleeping,
he's like a little angel.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.157
l was planning to have
a glass of wine. . .

11:58.320 --> 12:00.117
. . .sit in the hot tub
before you came.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.317
l'm sorry. l just wanted to be sure
he got the book. l'll get out.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.232
Alan. Would you like to join me?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.550
Well, l didn't bring a bathing suit.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.995
You don't need a bathing suit.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.792
Okay.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.910
Have you been keeping up
the chlorine treatments?

12:16.080 --> 12:19.595
Without a bathing suit, you're just
inviting algae into your privates.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.152
-l like the new patio furniture.
-Thanks.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.834
-What is that, redwood?
-Teak.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.629
Oh, teak. That must have set me
back a few bucks.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.513
The salesman said it would pay
for itself in five years.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.671
Oh, really? How is it gonna do that?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.717
ls it gonna get a paper route?

12:40.480 --> 12:42.835
-lt's very nice.
-Thank you.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.669
Of course, it's gonna require a lot
of upkeep.

12:46.840 --> 12:52.710
Actually, all wood that's outside
requires upkeep except trees.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.717
They seem to have it down.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.469
Alan, are you nervous?

12:56.680 --> 12:57.829
Yeah, a little.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.549
l mean, we've been separated
for two years.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.359
l haven't seen you naked for four.

13:05.640 --> 13:09.349
Except, you know, that one time
l walked in on you on the toilet.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.316
Mom? You out there?

13:15.480 --> 13:17.198
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.510
-Take a deep breath.
-What?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.674
l'm thirsty.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.434
-Have something to drink.
-There's no more Goofy Juice.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.160
-So have some water.
-Fine.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.398
-Hey, Mom?
-What?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.195
l'm hungry too.
Can you make me a sandwich?

13:37.360 --> 13:40.557
-No. Have your drink and go to bed.
-Fine.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.957
Mom.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.274
-How about a cookie?
-You already brushed your teeth.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.112
-No, l didn't.
-You said you did.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.952
l always say that.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.635
-Well, then brush them and go to bed.
-Fine.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.551
Oh, God.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.635
Are you okay?

14:09.840 --> 14:13.071
There was a bright light
and l saw my dead grandma.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.711
She seemed happy.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.399
Here, have a little wine.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.835
Thank you. Thank you.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.155
That was close.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.992
Relax, he didn't see you.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.794
But what if he comes back?
Maybe l should go.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.719
Or we could go upstairs
and get in bed.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.153
Bed?

14:32.360 --> 14:34.237
-Our old bed?
-My new bed.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.670
Oh, what was wrong
with the old one?

14:36.840 --> 14:38.637
-Too many memories.
-Of what?

14:38.800 --> 14:41.268
You pretending to sleep
and me watching Letterman?

14:42.440 --> 14:44.351
Alan, do you wanna have this
conversation?

14:44.520 --> 14:47.751
No, l don't. But apparently,
my mouth has a mind of its own.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.837
Well, let's put your mouth
to better use.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.353
l can't go back underwater, Judith.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.076
-Hey, Charlie.
-Yeah?

15:00.240 --> 15:01.878
Not that it's any of my business. . .

15:02.040 --> 15:04.190
. . .l couldn't help noticing
the matched set. . .

15:04.360 --> 15:06.954
. . .of rotating floozies
on your deck earlier.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.118
They were for Alan. l was trying
to get his mind off of Judith.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.795
With a night of meaningless,
impersonal group sex?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.076
What a good brother.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.319
No, no, a good brother
gets him a couple of girls.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.916
lt takes a great brother
to get him two from the same egg.

15:24.560 --> 15:29.236
You know, there is a possibility
that we were wrong about this.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.630
Maybe Alan and Judith
can work things out.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.478
Maybe. But if they do. . .

15:33.640 --> 15:36.108
-. . .what happens to Jake?
-Grows up in a happy home. . .

15:36.280 --> 15:38.350
. . .with a mommy and daddy
who love each other?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.431
Yeah, but what about me?

15:41.680 --> 15:43.955
lt's too late for you, Charlie.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.118
No, l mean,
what happens to me and Jake?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.679
l'll never get to see him.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.557
You really love the little guy, huh?

15:52.240 --> 15:55.073
Yeah, l guess l do.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.398
Love hurts, Rose.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.750
Yes, it does.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.831
Especially when you've given
your heart. . .

16:02.000 --> 16:04.116
. . .to someone who barely knows
you exist.

16:04.280 --> 16:08.637
Who insists on plowing through
strange, stupid women. . .

16:08.800 --> 16:10.916
. . .who could never love him
the way you do. . .

16:11.080 --> 16:12.877
. . .leaving you to stand outside. . .

16:13.040 --> 16:14.598
. . .alone in the night. . .

16:14.760 --> 16:18.116
. . .wishing with all your heart
that he would come to his senses. . .

16:18.280 --> 16:23.115
. . .and realize that his true happiness
lies with you and no one else. . .

16:23.280 --> 16:25.874
. . .but knowing all the while
that it will never happen. . .

16:26.040 --> 16:29.749
. . .because he's a selfish, immature,
heartless jerk.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.472
l mean. . .

16:36.240 --> 16:37.275
. . .poor baby.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.073
Okay, l'm gonna stick my neck
out here. . .

16:45.240 --> 16:47.515
. . .and say that was the best sex
we ever had.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.796
-l agree.
-Not that it wasn't good before.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.109
lt wasn't.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.875
Okay, granted.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.478
Which raises the question:

16:59.160 --> 17:00.832
Why is it so much better now?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.116
-Does it matter?
-Well, no, not really.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.156
l mean, just curious.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.356
l mean, l--

17:07.520 --> 17:09.988
l noticed some new moves
on your part. . .

17:10.160 --> 17:13.196
. . .and l can't help wondering where
you might have picked them up.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.714
You haven't been with other women
in two years?

17:15.880 --> 17:19.349
Oh, no, l've been with other women,
l just didn't learn anything.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.628
You, on the other hand, have
an entirely new sexual repertoire. . .

17:23.800 --> 17:27.917
. . .including a couple of numbers
l requested when we were married.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.310
-Alan--
-And by requested l mean begged.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.636
Please don't go there.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.712
Now, see, that's what l'm used to
hearing from you in bed.

17:35.880 --> 17:41.830
''Don't go there. '' ''Don't touch that. ''
''Leave that alone, it's not a toy. ''

17:42.680 --> 17:45.035
So l've changed.
l would think you would be happy.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.270
Well, l was. Very happy.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.550
But then l started to think about it.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.280
There's no reason
you couldn't have changed with me.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.192
-Oh, please.
-l gave you every chance.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.238
l bought tickets to sex seminars,
l brought home books. . .

17:57.400 --> 18:00.631
. . .and tapes and accessories.
And what happened?

18:00.800 --> 18:03.075
l sat right here reading
and watching by myself. . .

18:03.240 --> 18:05.879
. . .while eating low-fat love jelly
out of the tube.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.758
Okay, l can see this was a bad idea.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.354
No, the bad idea was sitting in
that filthy hot tub. . .

18:10.520 --> 18:11.794
. . .without a bathing suit.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.030
l can feel mushrooms
growing in my crack.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.514
Just go home, Alan.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.989
We're not married.
You can't tell me what to do.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.277
-Hey, Mom? Does this look infected?
-Okay, bye!

18:27.240 --> 18:30.357
lt's okay, l didn't see anything.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.035
Hey.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.233
Hey.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.311
What are you watching?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.750
Soft-core porn.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.752
Sound's not on.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.831
l don't need to hear them.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.630
Aren't those the twins
from the deck?

19:11.840 --> 19:13.353
Too late now, Alan.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.511
You could have been delivering
that pizza.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.077
How's Judith?

19:22.920 --> 19:23.955
Fine.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.315
She got some new patio furniture.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.555
That's nice.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.233
Teak.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.437
Put in some rose bushes too.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.198
How about that.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.193
And l think the neighbors
got a new dog.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.395
Mean dog.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.679
Really?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.195
Might have been a coyote.

19:51.960 --> 19:56.511
Hard to say.
lt was dark and l was crying.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.074
-Anything else?
-No.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.879
Oh, yeah,
l saw our dead grandmother.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.915
-Where?
-ln the hot tub.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.236
Oh, that's the cab.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.790
Could you lend me 60 bucks?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.793
l don't have my wallet on me.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.632
Sure.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.514
Oh, thank you.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.112
l suddenly have a craving
for pizza.
