WEBVTT

00:08.792 --> 00:10.041
(Mr. Hall)
'Everybody, listen up.'

00:10.125 --> 00:12.333
I could not be
a prouder father today

00:12.417 --> 00:14.542
because my son,
Grant, qualified

00:14.625 --> 00:19.125
for the Junior Olympic
training
program in wrestling.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.083
Oh, yeah!

00:26.333 --> 00:27.500
We've got a plan to bring

00:27.583 --> 00:29.250
a shiny trinket
back to the store.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.792
It's a...it's
a little thing called..

00:31.875 --> 00:33.583
...Olympic gold!

00:36.000 --> 00:39.875
Hey, hey, no pressure
or nothing, huh?

00:39.959 --> 00:43.375
This space right here,
is reserved for the medal.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.500
Work hard, never quit.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.959
- That's what we do, right?
- That's right.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.583
Beers up front, everybody!

01:15.667 --> 01:16.959
Good speech, Dad.

01:17.959 --> 01:19.125
Look at that guy.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.750
Can you believe it?
I can remember him

01:21.834 --> 01:24.166
when he was a sparkle in my eye.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.542
And now he eats an entire
cow
in one sitting.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.583
You got a plan
for yourself, Maurice?

01:29.667 --> 01:30.834
Me?

01:30.917 --> 01:32.375
Yeah, you.

01:32.458 --> 01:35.000
Grant set a goal.
There's no stopping him.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.208
So what's it gonna be for you?

01:41.834 --> 01:44.542
I guess I don't know yet.

01:44.625 --> 01:45.959
'What I want to be.'

01:47.375 --> 01:48.917
Hey.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.834
I'm talking to you
about your future.

01:50.917 --> 01:53.417
You're 16. You're not
the baby, anymore.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.208
I know.

01:55.291 --> 01:57.333
I'm saying..

01:57.417 --> 01:59.375
...show some direction, Maurice.

01:59.458 --> 02:02.667
Or I'll find
a direction for you.

02:56.834 --> 02:59.792
Always count on
the warm atmosphere in here.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.333
You ever wonder
if they're not really
dead

03:01.417 --> 03:03.125
and they're all of a
sudden,
gonna sit up?

03:03.208 --> 03:04.583
That's not funny.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.333
You going to be okay?

03:06.417 --> 03:07.583
What do we got?

03:07.667 --> 03:09.583
Construction team
razing a landfill

03:09.667 --> 03:11.083
up in Northeast,
found this.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.667
How long has it been in there?

03:12.750 --> 03:13.917
Skeletal remains tell us

03:14.000 --> 03:15.750
he'd been there about 20 years.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.000
He?

03:17.083 --> 03:18.583
Skull shape and size
says young adult male.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.458
Pulled all missing persons
from '87 back to '77.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.291
Dental records narrowed it down.

03:24.583 --> 03:25.917
Maurice Hall.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.917
Went missing
in October of '84

03:28.000 --> 03:29.750
from the family apartment
in Kensington.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.625
Lived above their grocery store.

03:31.709 --> 03:33.250
He was 16 years old.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.792
They thought he was
a teenage runaway.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.291
Calcaneus bone is shot.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.917
So are the metatarsals.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.208
Means the right foot
was shattered.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.875
So Maurice wasn't
running anywhere.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.917
- Then what killed him?
- Multiple skull fractures.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.166
What kind of weapon?

03:45.250 --> 03:46.375
These kind of fractures..

03:46.458 --> 03:47.917
...it was something
long and thin.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.625
Can't get more
specific than that?

03:49.709 --> 03:52.792
The state of decomp,
no fibers, no striations
left.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.959
For 23 years, the family hoped

03:56.041 --> 03:57.959
he was out there...somewhere.

03:58.041 --> 04:01.500
Turns out, he was practically
in their backyard. All along.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.834
(Jeffries)
'This about retirement,
boss?'

04:36.917 --> 04:38.041
Will, there's something
I wanted to let you in on.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.291
Alright.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.375
I'd rather you hear it
from me than someone else.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.041
- Okay.
- We got a call.

04:42.125 --> 04:45.834
Guy facing an armed robbery
charge, offers up a proffer.

04:45.917 --> 04:48.125
Says a friend of his,
ex-truck driver, confessed to

04:48.208 --> 04:51.875
a fatal hit-and-run
on the turnpike. Winter of
'95.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.250
You talking about my wife?

04:57.542 --> 04:58.709
Who's it from?

04:58.792 --> 05:00.125
Jersey State Police.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.000
Could be the end of the line.

05:05.375 --> 05:06.667
What's his name?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.500
They got anything
that can put him
away?

05:13.583 --> 05:15.208
Better than
a con
snitching?

05:15.291 --> 05:17.166
Proffer is all they have so far.

05:18.417 --> 05:20.834
Jersey has their best guys
on it, Will.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.959
They know this is for you.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.333
Alright.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.458
Maurice Hall, sophomore
at James Marshall High.

05:35.542 --> 05:38.166
Stock boy at his father's
grocery store.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.458
Mom died from cancer in '81.

05:40.542 --> 05:42.208
Older brother was
a varsity athlete.

05:42.291 --> 05:43.625
He worked at the store, too.

05:43.709 --> 05:45.250
Hall and Sons Grocery Mart was

05:45.333 --> 05:46.875
the center of the search effort.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.792
Volunteers papered
the town with these.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.667
Usual loony
callers.
Nothing solid.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.417
Father said Maurice was
clean-cut, kept to himself.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.625
But it says here, Maurice
had been acting erratic

05:55.709 --> 05:58.250
before he ran away.
Late for work.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.500
- Moody.
- Maybe he wasn't so
clean-cut.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.000
Maybe he was just
a sulky teenager.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.542
Father's still in Kensington.

06:03.625 --> 06:04.959
Then we're the visit
he's been hoping

06:05.041 --> 06:06.959
not to get for 23 years.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.041
Are you sure it was
Maurice that you found?

06:19.125 --> 06:20.709
We're sure.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.375
I'm very sorry, Mr. Hall.

06:22.458 --> 06:25.417
(Valens)
'Someone from the ME's office
will call you.'

06:27.542 --> 06:29.959
You said Maurice's behavior
was erratic

06:30.041 --> 06:31.417
before he disappeared.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.041
Well, he had a pretty much
erratic way about him.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.875
- All the time.
- What do you mean?

06:36.959 --> 06:38.834
- He was unique.
- Was creative, like his
mother.

06:38.917 --> 06:40.834
And those two
were peas in a pod.

06:40.917 --> 06:44.125
(Mr. Hall)
'Yeah. It wasn't easy
for Maurice after she
passed.'

06:44.208 --> 06:46.417
He was different from the
usual
types in this neighborhood.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.792
- Usual type being?
- Me.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.250
Us. Regular guys.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.500
Can you be...little
more specific?

06:52.583 --> 06:55.458
Sports, beer, girls.
That's the norm.

06:55.542 --> 07:00.500
Whereas, Maurice was into
books,
music. That was him.

07:00.583 --> 07:04.291
Anybody give Maurice trouble
for being different?

07:04.375 --> 07:06.125
One time I know for sure.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.709
That same fall.

07:12.375 --> 07:15.041
With Grant training,
I'm one hand short here.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.583
- And if you left school--
- High school dropout?

07:17.667 --> 07:19.709
Hey, you're looking at
one.
You could contribute

07:19.792 --> 07:21.333
to the family
and your brother's dream.

07:21.417 --> 07:25.250
I don't want to work here
the rest of my life.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.250
Why is
that,
hotshot?

07:27.333 --> 07:28.875
I don't mean it
as an insult, Dad.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.166
Hey.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.041
- You're odd, Maurice.
- And you dress funny.

07:34.125 --> 07:37.125
- Don't.
- Oh.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.000
What's this?

07:39.083 --> 07:42.667
Nothing, it's some meathead,
Dad. Just...being a jerk.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.166
You should've seen
what I did to him.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.041
You ought to learn
to defend yourself.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.125
I'm hoping
it won't happen
again.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.208
I tried showing him how, Dad.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.500
(Mr. Hall)
'You tell me who did this.'

07:51.583 --> 07:54.792
I'll have Grant
take care of
him.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.125
I don't need his help.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.291
I got it.
I do.

08:06.667 --> 08:10.500
Maurice never told you
who gave him the black eye?

08:10.583 --> 08:12.542
It wasn't easy for Maurice.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.417
Big brother, this great athlete.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.959
Girls going after him,
the way they did.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.709
That's some balls
on that bully..

08:19.792 --> 08:21.250
...picking on your kid brother?

08:21.333 --> 08:23.166
Some people are real jerks.

08:24.250 --> 08:27.208
I got inventory to do.
You okay, Dad?

08:27.291 --> 08:28.583
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.834
All this time, I'm thinking

08:32.917 --> 08:35.709
Maurice would turn up
one day and..

08:35.792 --> 08:38.667
"Hey, Dad. Got the wandering
out of my system.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.792
I'm back home."

08:42.333 --> 08:44.417
Not going to happen, huh?

08:56.083 --> 08:59.750
If somebody picked on me
when I was little..

08:59.834 --> 09:02.792
...I'd tell him
who my brother
was..

09:02.875 --> 09:04.875
...guy'd step off in a hurry.

09:04.959 --> 09:06.792
That's right.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.458
You didn't have
Maurice's back like that?

09:08.542 --> 09:10.458
Believe me, I did.
It was known.

09:10.542 --> 09:13.375
- So who gave him the black
eye?
- I told you, nobody!

09:14.750 --> 09:18.125
Nobody picked...
on my kid brother.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.959
Except you.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.458
It's for his own good. The
only
way to get through to him.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.083
And what does that mean?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.959
One night, I'm jogging
in the neighborhood, I find

09:28.041 --> 09:29.291
Maurice doing something
that would've given

09:29.375 --> 09:31.208
our old man a heart attack.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.166
What are you doing?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.000
What?

10:20.417 --> 10:22.500
Are you a queer?

10:22.583 --> 10:23.875
Tell me.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.250
Are you a queer?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.625
I-I'm not.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.500
You're sure acting like one.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.000
Leave me alone, Grant.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.417
Get up, little brother.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.083
Huh?

10:41.917 --> 10:44.041
Oh, no, you don't!
Get away from him right now!

10:44.125 --> 10:45.250
I am not even kidding.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.959
- Excuse me?
- No, excuse me.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.041
I'm Crystal.
This is my boyfriend.

10:49.125 --> 10:52.959
And you must be the piece of
scum on the bottom of my shoe.

10:53.041 --> 10:54.375
He's your boyfriend?

10:56.792 --> 10:58.625
I don't think so.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.250
You okay, baby?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.875
I'm okay...baby.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.291
Get out of here.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.375
Is this your girlfriend,
Maurice?

11:18.458 --> 11:19.792
Yeah.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.208
You heard her.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.875
Get lost, Grant.

11:28.834 --> 11:34.083
Blew my mind.
I thought he was...you know..

11:34.166 --> 11:35.917
Uh, why didn't this girlfriend

11:36.000 --> 11:37.583
come up in the original
investigation?

11:37.667 --> 11:39.709
I couldn't talk about her.
My dad would've lost it.

11:39.792 --> 11:43.083
- 'Cause Crystal was black.
- 'Cause she was a dancer.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.792
And so was your brother.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.959
That's the kind of thing
gets you offed around here.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.667
Boy dancer...in Kensington.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.625
The dance class
Maurice's brother saw

11:58.709 --> 12:00.625
was at the Jacob Hays
School Of The Arts.

12:00.709 --> 12:02.208
Art school in the middle
of Kensington.

12:02.291 --> 12:03.458
Yeah, bet the neighbors
loved that.

12:03.542 --> 12:04.917
Bunch of
freaks
run amok.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.125
You find anything
on this Crystal?

12:06.208 --> 12:07.792
She's back at that
school teaching
now.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.291
I'll send Kat and Scotty.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.542
For you.
Jersey State
Police.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.709
- Case file on Isaac Keller?
- Okay.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.500
- This is for the Hall case?
- Nope.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.500
Okay.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.542
Crystal Stacy?

12:32.625 --> 12:35.750
Detectives Valens, Miller.
Got a few questions for you.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.291
Remember this kid?

12:37.917 --> 12:40.542
Maurice Hall.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.041
I remember this boy.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.583
Saw him get into a fight
with some jerk.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.333
- His brother.
- I didn't even know his
name.

12:47.417 --> 12:50.166
I thought Maurice
was your boyfriend.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.542
No.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.500
I never met him
before that night.

12:53.583 --> 12:56.125
He's a total stranger
who you save from a fight?

12:56.208 --> 12:59.625
Not a total stranger.
I'd seen him. Outside our
class.

12:59.709 --> 13:02.000
Almost every night.
Doing the routine with us.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.709
Is that why you intervened
on his behalf?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.041
It was my superhero act.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.083
Saving my people from evil.

13:09.166 --> 13:12.291
- Your people?
- The inspired ones.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.166
Who are you?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.041
Best in the school.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.208
Star of the future.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.000
Crystal Stacy.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.208
Maurice Hall.

13:27.291 --> 13:31.333
You're good. Your
moves,
I've seen you.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.875
- Really?
- Who do you study with?

13:33.959 --> 13:35.375
And don't tell me
it's just natural
talent

13:35.458 --> 13:37.417
because then you're a
liar
or I have to hate you.

13:39.208 --> 13:41.417
My mom taught me some things.

13:44.250 --> 13:48.208
She'd dance in the kitchen and..

13:48.291 --> 13:49.458
...and I'd try to keep up.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.417
And now she lets you
dance on the street?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.583
She's dead.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.583
Sorry.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.291
Look, if you're serious,
you have to go to our
school.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.625
I mean, it's the max.
You get the best teachers.

14:07.709 --> 14:09.583
Then you can join a
great
company in New York

14:09.667 --> 14:12.542
and then be famous.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.041
Like a "Solid Gold" dancer?

14:16.709 --> 14:19.583
Do you know
who Martha Graham is?

14:19.667 --> 14:22.542
Bob Fosse? Twyla Tharp?

14:22.625 --> 14:25.458
I'm talking about greatness.
Say it with me.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.667
I work in a grocery store.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.959
Well, auditions for the
school
are on the 30th.

14:32.041 --> 14:33.250
You should try out.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.500
But not if you can't
nail the hip snap.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.917
The what?

14:40.750 --> 14:44.750
Buh-buh.
You got to snap it, like
fast.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.583
This a private lesson?

14:50.667 --> 14:53.000
Relax, Carlos.
We're just practicing.

14:53.083 --> 14:56.458
Yeah, I know what
stock boy is practicing.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.875
Stay away from her.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.834
Stop.

15:00.917 --> 15:04.083
Ow! Carlos, stop it!
Stop!

15:05.583 --> 15:07.834
- Stop!
- Let her go, man.

15:07.917 --> 15:10.959
You think
you got moves, poser?

15:11.041 --> 15:12.709
You, me, right here.

15:12.792 --> 15:15.917
Five o'clock tomorrow.
We'll see.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.458
(Valens)
This guy have
violent tendencies?

15:24.542 --> 15:25.750
Did he ever?

15:25.834 --> 15:28.667
I had no sense back then.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.625
What was Carlos up to,
asking Maurice to meet
him?

15:31.709 --> 15:34.917
I don't know. But I never saw
Maurice again after that.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.041
Okay, let's do this thing

15:45.125 --> 15:47.542
'cause I have
an open call in 20.

15:47.625 --> 15:51.500
You got a tutu
to wear over those
tights?

15:51.583 --> 15:54.250
Oh. You distracted?

15:56.583 --> 15:59.291
We got an idea you know
how Maurice Hall died.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.542
That idea don't hold
water.
Sorry, sweetheart.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.083
(Vera)
'Looked up your record,
Carlos.'

16:04.166 --> 16:07.041
You got a long history
for using your fists freely.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.458
They got a word
for that, sweetheart?

16:09.542 --> 16:11.542
Passionate.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.000
Homicidal.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.500
Maurice pissed you off,
hitting on your girlfriend

16:15.583 --> 16:19.041
and you told him
to meet you the next day?

16:19.125 --> 16:23.583
It was a duel.
<i>Mano a mano.</i>

16:23.667 --> 16:25.250
Like a catfight, right?

16:27.583 --> 16:30.083
You think dancing's
for weaklings?

16:32.333 --> 16:33.709
When was the last time
you carried

16:33.792 --> 16:37.041
your body weight on your toes,
while running

16:37.125 --> 16:39.166
throwing a woman in the air
and catching her

16:39.250 --> 16:41.709
without breaking a sweat?

16:41.792 --> 16:42.875
It's been a while.

16:42.959 --> 16:46.291
This duel,
it a fight to the death?

16:46.375 --> 16:49.750
Yeah, sorta.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.083
Death...of the ego.

16:54.458 --> 16:57.250
Where are you
taking me, exactly?

16:59.041 --> 17:00.583
What's this?

17:00.667 --> 17:03.083
The lion's den.

17:03.166 --> 17:04.709
Break a leg.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.000
(Leroy)
'And we go!'

17:33.083 --> 17:35.750
Five, six, seven

17:35.834 --> 17:37.083
'eight, go!
One'

17:43.834 --> 17:47.125
'And..'

17:47.208 --> 17:48.709
'Let me see it.'

17:48.792 --> 17:50.709
'Yes.'

17:50.792 --> 17:52.041
'And..'

17:54.875 --> 17:56.125
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

17:56.208 --> 17:58.583
'You can dance
better than that!'

18:03.667 --> 18:05.709
'Oh, my God!'

18:06.667 --> 18:08.417
This poor child
done got lost

18:08.500 --> 18:10.625
and wandered in here.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.166
Why did none of you tell him

18:12.250 --> 18:16.542
that this was a dance class
and not the steel mill?

18:20.583 --> 18:23.375
I-I'm here for the class.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.458
To dance.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.417
That's sad.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.208
You gonna make me cry.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.625
Over here.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.417
Five.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.792
Six.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.917
Five, six,
seven,
eight, go.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.792
One,
two..
Lift up.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.375
Three, four,
and five,
six.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.333
Now spot.
I said spot.
Spot!

18:45.417 --> 18:46.709
I am!

18:46.792 --> 18:51.458
What's wrong with you?
You almost took my toe off!

18:51.542 --> 18:53.208
And so what if I did?

18:53.291 --> 18:56.208
A dancer has to know pain.

18:56.291 --> 18:57.959
Who taught you to be so lazy?

18:58.041 --> 19:01.375
My mother taught me to dance.

19:01.458 --> 19:04.875
On break from
the wallpaper
factory?

19:04.959 --> 19:08.875
She teach you how
to do the foxtrot?

19:08.959 --> 19:10.542
Don't talk about my mother.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.667
Thin skin.
You'll never make
it.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.875
Now go home and
cry to your
mama.

19:15.959 --> 19:18.333
What would you know
about making it?

19:21.291 --> 19:24.542
You...are a insolent

19:24.625 --> 19:27.625
little piece of white trash.

19:30.417 --> 19:32.417
Now, out!

19:37.834 --> 19:39.583
And five.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.834
'Six.
Five, six, seven, eight..'

19:44.333 --> 19:46.583
Dr. Leroy.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.917
The second abusive dad
I never wanted.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.917
What was with the wooden staff?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.542
His trademark.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.625
Broke a girl's foot
with it, one time.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.291
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.959
I used to come
here
twice a week

20:06.041 --> 20:07.583
when I was
on the
road.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.083
Home away from home.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.834
On the road?

20:11.917 --> 20:13.125
Hauling freight.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.417
Oh, me, too, man.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.125
Hmm.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.291
This was ten years ago.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.959
Me, too.

20:21.041 --> 20:23.667
Ten years ago. Time flies.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.792
It certainly does.

20:28.333 --> 20:31.875
Thought you might
have looked familiar.

20:31.959 --> 20:33.792
Didn't do runs here though.

20:33.875 --> 20:34.959
No?

20:35.041 --> 20:37.792
Ohio to Bakersfield
for seven years.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.417
Why did you give it up?

20:40.583 --> 20:42.625
One day, I just
couldn't do it anymore.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.500
'Just like that?'

20:46.125 --> 20:48.083
Yeah, just like that.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.959
'Thought about
what was important.'

20:50.041 --> 20:52.625
The kids and the wife won out,
you know what I mean?

20:54.750 --> 20:57.000
Sure do.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.500
That's your wife?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.667
Yeah.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.875
Kind of woman you want
to stay home with.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.709
Yeah.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.500
Well.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.834
Good thing you never
drove the turnpike.

21:22.917 --> 21:25.166
- Rough ride.
- 'That's right.'

21:27.291 --> 21:29.875
I did, you know.

21:29.959 --> 21:32.583
'For a few weeks
when I first started out.'

21:32.667 --> 21:35.417
Winter of '95.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.083
That right?

21:38.166 --> 21:39.875
'Was rain.'

21:40.875 --> 21:42.542
Loads of it.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.917
I had put that out of my head.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.625
It was a winter from hell.

21:55.959 --> 21:57.208
Maurice Hall humiliated you
in front of your students

21:57.291 --> 22:00.709
and then he winds up
buried in a landfill.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.208
Hideous
coincidence,
I assure you.

22:03.291 --> 22:04.875
His foot was crushed.

22:04.959 --> 22:08.458
Which is what you did
to one of your students

22:08.542 --> 22:09.625
with your staff.

22:09.709 --> 22:12.333
If that girl had
known the routine

22:12.417 --> 22:16.750
her foot would not have
been in the way of my
staff.

22:16.834 --> 22:20.291
We've got former students
of yours say you were..

22:20.375 --> 22:21.500
...unbalanced.

22:21.583 --> 22:23.583
Unbalanced? No.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.625
Ruthless, yes.

22:25.709 --> 22:28.542
I was a drill sergeant,
getting my students ready

22:28.625 --> 22:30.291
for the war
that is the dance world.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.083
And where did Maurice fit in?

22:32.166 --> 22:33.375
He wasn't your student.

22:33.458 --> 22:37.583
Oh. But he benefited
from my teaching.

22:37.667 --> 22:38.792
How's that?

22:38.875 --> 22:40.792
The grocery store.

22:40.875 --> 22:43.125
It became our classroom.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.583
Dr. Leroy?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.208
You.

22:58.291 --> 22:59.959
You come to grovel?

23:00.041 --> 23:00.959
Please don't.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.458
Can't you see I'm meditating?

23:03.542 --> 23:04.625
'Wait.'

23:06.458 --> 23:08.083
I-I want to dance.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.458
Not in the street.
In your class.

23:10.542 --> 23:14.000
With my-my head
held right, my-my feet.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.917
I want to bleed.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.250
Oh, brother.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.500
"Work hard, never quit."

23:20.583 --> 23:22.667
That's what my dad says.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.208
What?

23:29.625 --> 23:32.000
Do you think you have talent?

23:37.208 --> 23:38.583
Yeah.

23:40.917 --> 23:42.458
I do.

23:42.542 --> 23:44.375
Fine.

23:44.458 --> 23:45.709
You'll have to quit this job.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.583
There's work to be done
and only so many hours.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.792
I-I can't.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.875
It's my dad's store.
He needs me.

23:52.959 --> 23:54.834
Hard choices.
Get used to
them.

23:54.917 --> 23:58.041
I-I can do both,
practice and work.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.792
Dr. Leroy, I'm gonna audition

24:03.875 --> 24:07.333
and make it in,
and I'll be in your class.

24:07.417 --> 24:08.875
Just watch me.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.500
No, Detective Rush.

25:42.583 --> 25:46.500
We are not all light
in our jazz shoes.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.834
Gene Kelly.
Mikhail Baryshnikov.

25:49.917 --> 25:51.625
Lady-killers.

25:51.709 --> 25:54.375
And Maurice, with Crystal.

25:54.458 --> 25:55.959
Dancers in love.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.959
You see,
if they're really good

25:59.041 --> 26:01.750
it's their soul out there..

26:01.834 --> 26:06.083
...moving, in rhythm
with another.

26:09.583 --> 26:10.959
Very romantic.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.083
Not when one of them
ends up dead.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.625
(Miller)
'You didn't tell us about
the grocery store, Crystal.'

26:19.709 --> 26:23.500
(Valens)
'You and Maurice,
getting it on.'

26:25.166 --> 26:26.333
I'm sorry.

26:26.417 --> 26:30.041
It's not a good idea,
lying to us.

26:30.125 --> 26:34.750
I can't even
think about
him.

26:34.834 --> 26:35.959
I try not to.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.709
Maybe it's time
you
get it off your
chest.

26:41.333 --> 26:45.083
Maurice was my hope.

26:45.166 --> 26:47.834
Somebody'd love me.

26:47.917 --> 26:50.542
And be sweet.

26:50.625 --> 26:51.750
You know?

26:52.792 --> 26:55.250
I was just
trying
to help him.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.875
With his audition,
for your school?

27:00.291 --> 27:04.500
You guys can't imagine what
it was like to watch him
dance.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.500
It was like..

27:08.333 --> 27:11.041
...he was telling you

27:11.125 --> 27:12.750
all about him.

27:14.542 --> 27:16.375
Without saying a word.

27:19.417 --> 27:20.291
I was there

27:20.375 --> 27:22.417
when his father found out.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.417
About his dancing?

27:24.500 --> 27:28.000
And Maurice's dream..

27:28.083 --> 27:31.542
It fell apart.

28:19.041 --> 28:22.375
When are you going
to tell your dad?

28:23.750 --> 28:26.333
I can't. I can't.

28:26.417 --> 28:29.041
You can't keep doing
this double-life thing.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.834
It's messing with your dance.

28:31.917 --> 28:33.875
And that's like a tragedy.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.333
After my mom died..

28:41.583 --> 28:44.583
...my dad
caught
me in her room

28:44.667 --> 28:47.792
doing this dance
that
she had taught me.

28:47.875 --> 28:50.291
And he just grabbed..

28:50.375 --> 28:52.125
I can't tell him.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.041
Tell him.

28:53.125 --> 28:54.834
- I can't.
- Tell him.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.625
Shh.
Hide.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.125
Hide quick.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.834
Hey, I'm taking a few..

29:02.208 --> 29:04.458
I was just doing inventory.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.291
I told you not to do that.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.792
I'm not doing anything.

29:14.875 --> 29:16.333
Do you want dad to find out?

29:16.417 --> 29:17.917
Is that what you want?

29:19.333 --> 29:22.000
So what if he does?
It wouldn't be the worst
thing.

29:25.417 --> 29:28.000
Ow! My knee.
God!

29:28.083 --> 29:29.000
What?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.875
Grant, what the hell?

29:34.959 --> 29:36.250
I fell. I fell.

29:36.333 --> 29:37.500
It's my fault.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.041
Grant, get up!
What-what-what happened?

29:39.125 --> 29:40.583
Dad, we got in a fight
because--

29:40.667 --> 29:42.500
Maurice!
Shut up!

29:42.583 --> 29:44.792
Because I was practicing
in here.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.375
Practicing what?

29:46.458 --> 29:47.792
Dancing.

29:47.875 --> 29:49.792
I've been dancing, dad. And
I've
been getting really good.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.792
And-and there's a school
that I want to go to.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.291
Let's get you upstairs, Grant.

29:56.458 --> 29:57.834
(Maurice)
'There's an audition
tomorrow.'

29:57.917 --> 30:01.000
You're not going
to any damn
audition.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.291
Oh, my knee.
I can't. I can't.

30:04.417 --> 30:06.083
Sorry, Grant.
I-I didn't mean to.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.458
You're sorry? Your brother
can't walk because of you.

30:08.542 --> 30:10.709
It's not his fault, dad.

30:10.792 --> 30:14.041
If you ruined it all for
him,
god help you, Maurice.

30:14.125 --> 30:15.917
God help you!

30:18.291 --> 30:20.417
(Miller)
'What happened after that?'

30:20.500 --> 30:23.250
I beat it out of there.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.917
Leaving Maurice with his dad.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.875
And Dad's pride and
joy
with a bum knee.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.625
It's my fault.

30:31.709 --> 30:35.542
I pushed Maurice
to stick up for his
dream.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.458
And his father went ballistic.

30:46.375 --> 30:47.875
(Valens)
'I found out, Pat.'

30:47.959 --> 30:49.959
What Maurice did to Grant.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.792
Kids were messing around.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.041
Next thing you know
he wrenches his knee.

30:55.125 --> 30:56.583
Never got back on the horse.

30:56.667 --> 30:59.375
Your loser son ruins
it
for the good son.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.166
Your family was going to be
something if he made it.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.750
But Maurice blew it
for all of you.

31:04.834 --> 31:06.375
That ain't how it was.

31:06.458 --> 31:08.583
We got a witness
says you lost it that day

31:08.667 --> 31:09.625
threatening Maurice.

31:09.709 --> 31:11.000
No, that wasn't
what happened.

31:11.083 --> 31:14.041
"God help you, Maurice."
Your words.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.125
Yeah.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.333
The last I ever spoke
to my son.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.625
How do you think that feels?

31:21.125 --> 31:22.542
What's your problem?

31:22.625 --> 31:25.417
I'll bet you were relieved
when he didn't come home.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.333
Get twinkletoes
out of the
house?

31:27.417 --> 31:28.959
That kid had
more fricking talent

31:29.041 --> 31:30.875
in his little toe than
you've got in your whole body.

31:30.959 --> 31:32.208
I thought you
said
the last time

31:32.291 --> 31:34.500
you talked to him
was at the store.

31:34.583 --> 31:35.667
So?

31:37.291 --> 31:39.583
So..

31:39.667 --> 31:43.166
When did you see
him dance, Pat?

31:45.959 --> 31:49.041
I went...to the audition.

31:59.041 --> 32:02.333
Where is he?

32:02.417 --> 32:03.625
Dad.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.583
I'm Maurice Hall.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.375
I'm 16.

32:17.458 --> 32:19.542
I've only been
to one dance class

32:19.625 --> 32:22.041
and...it didn't go very well.

32:25.125 --> 32:28.583
I learned from my mom

32:28.667 --> 32:30.834
'and if she's
watching me tonight..'

32:32.792 --> 32:34.458
...I hope I make her proud.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.959
(Pat)
'Maurice!'

35:19.041 --> 35:20.166
Maurice!

35:31.583 --> 35:33.083
He thought
I was coming after him.

35:33.166 --> 35:34.417
(Vera)
'You can't blame him.'

35:34.500 --> 35:36.875
The night Maurice's dream
took off

35:36.959 --> 35:39.709
Grant's was going
down the tubes.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.041
Big disappointment.

35:42.125 --> 35:43.542
No Olympics,
no gold.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.542
(Valens)
'Tell you what's
even worse.'

35:45.625 --> 35:47.041
Disappointing your father.

35:47.125 --> 35:51.875
I love Grant,
gold medal or not.

35:51.959 --> 35:53.417
You ever tell him that?

35:56.166 --> 35:58.625
It haunts me.

35:58.709 --> 36:01.083
The way I was a father
to those boys.

36:02.542 --> 36:04.959
Ignoring the one
and pushing the other.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.458
I paid for that.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.458
(Rush)
You didn't tell us what a
good
dancer your brother was.

36:20.542 --> 36:21.917
(Jeffries)
Or how he ruined your life.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.792
What are you talking about?

36:25.875 --> 36:29.208
A knee injury ruined
your wrestling
career.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.750
Everything you'd worked for.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.458
Things happen when
you're an athlete.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.750
I blew my knee
out,
senior year.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.458
Football dreams, down the drain.

36:36.542 --> 36:37.875
That's rough.

36:37.959 --> 36:41.291
Think you know who you
are,
then, not so much.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.166
It didn't get me that way.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.250
Made me real angry.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.583
For a long, long time.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.083
And right when
your dreams are
dying

36:50.166 --> 36:51.917
Maurice takes the spotlight.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.166
(Jeffries)
'The look your dad had on his
face when he saw Maurice dance'

36:55.250 --> 36:57.250
that was how he used
to look at you.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.041
And you couldn't
let Maurice have
it.

37:00.125 --> 37:03.333
What did I care about
his fricking dancing? Come on.

37:03.417 --> 37:06.125
Shattered foot,
crushed skull.

37:06.208 --> 37:08.041
Lot of rage there.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.417
Kind of injuries that could
have been caused by a crutch.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.458
Is that what you think?

37:16.542 --> 37:18.417
Yeah.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.208
That's what we think.

37:25.125 --> 37:30.583
Um, Mom..
Maurice was her baby.

37:30.667 --> 37:34.291
Me, I only ever had my dad
thinking I was somebody.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.125
Till Maurice took that away?

37:38.208 --> 37:42.166
I used to have this crazy dream.

37:42.250 --> 37:44.333
I had it again
last night.

37:46.291 --> 37:49.000
I find Maurice,
and I grab him

37:49.083 --> 37:51.542
and I put him on a bus
to New York City.

37:53.458 --> 37:54.750
And even though he's scared

37:54.834 --> 37:57.458
I give him my big brother
look, you know.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.709
And I say,
"Forget about us, Maurice.

38:02.792 --> 38:03.875
Just go."

38:05.542 --> 38:08.500
What happened
after the audition,
Grant?

38:08.583 --> 38:11.000
Talk about regret.

38:11.083 --> 38:14.291
Feeling it every second
of your waste of a life.

38:20.125 --> 38:22.250
He never should have come back.

38:23.542 --> 38:24.959
Never.

38:40.667 --> 38:43.041
Got to face
the old man sometime.

38:43.125 --> 38:45.375
He's not asleep yet, is he?

38:45.458 --> 38:47.333
Sitting in his chair.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.500
How mad is he?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.959
[imitating Pat]
Now, that stuff
don't come all naturally.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.417
That's real training.

39:07.959 --> 39:10.583
He said that?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.125
About me?

39:12.208 --> 39:15.208
Said him and ma used to
go down to Atlantic City.

39:15.291 --> 39:16.792
Dance all night.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.625
But he never saw anyone
do it like you.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.250
He's saying that tonight,
but once your knee's
better

39:31.333 --> 39:34.333
he'll be on
my case again.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.458
Your knee.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.417
I thought it was
messed up
royally.

39:47.750 --> 39:51.000
Be careful with
your leg, Grant.

39:51.083 --> 39:54.834
You're going mess
it up even worse.

39:56.166 --> 39:57.458
What?

39:58.917 --> 40:00.417
What?

40:02.208 --> 40:03.709
You're faking it.

40:06.709 --> 40:07.875
Why?

40:07.959 --> 40:09.208
Because I quit wrestling.

40:09.291 --> 40:12.500
- Quit?
- Only I can't, because of
Dad.

40:12.583 --> 40:14.500
So this is me quitting.

40:14.583 --> 40:16.750
Get it?

40:16.834 --> 40:18.291
I went to my first

40:18.375 --> 40:21.333
Junior Olympic
training session.

40:21.417 --> 40:22.667
Got so freaked out

40:22.750 --> 40:24.709
I didn't even change
out of my street clothes.

40:24.792 --> 40:26.875
Pretended like I was
just some guy

40:26.959 --> 40:29.000
headed someplace else
looking in.

40:29.083 --> 40:32.000
They were good. So what?

40:32.083 --> 40:34.709
You're good, too.

40:34.792 --> 40:36.208
Not like them.

40:36.291 --> 40:37.834
- Tonight, I was really
nervous.
- Shut up.

40:37.917 --> 40:39.083
'Thought everybody..'

40:39.166 --> 40:40.291
...was better than me.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.500
You know,
you're making it worse!

40:42.583 --> 40:45.458
Talking about your stupid,
stupid show!

40:48.458 --> 40:50.250
If you don't make it
all the way..

40:50.333 --> 40:52.166
- Shut up!
- At least you tried.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.333
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You tried.

40:53.417 --> 40:54.625
Dad will still love you.

40:54.709 --> 40:56.667
- No, he won't!
- He will!

40:56.750 --> 40:58.834
He won't!

40:58.917 --> 41:00.041
Dad!

41:01.500 --> 41:02.500
Dad!

41:02.583 --> 41:03.834
Ah.
