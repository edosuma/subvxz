00:03.295 --> 00:06.048
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

the Vice President's brother.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.186
Why you want to see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

of breaking out?

This guy was talking about it in the yard
yesterday. I didn't know what to say.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.376
Tell Officer Bellick.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.088

- Yep. He's my new cellmate.

- That's a problem.
- He doesn't sleep.

was that most death penalty cases

30:18.525 --> 30:20.652
take 10 years to exhaust all appeals.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.696
Lincoln got there in three.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.406
So for it to be expedited,

30:24.489 --> 30:27.326
there had to have been
some sort of political influence, right?

30:27.409 --> 30:30.078
Well, given that Terrence Steadman
is the Vice President's brother,

30:30.162 --> 30:31.413
that's not too hard to believe.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.583
How, though? They got to every judge
that rejected Lincoln's appeal?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.460
It doesn't take a judge.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.922
All it takes is a little special attention
from one of his clerks.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.634
But how Lincoln got fast-tracked
doesn't interest me. It's why.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.678
If he was set up, then why?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.848
I think the answer to that
might lie in the victim.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.560
What do we know?
That he was the CEO of Ecofield, right?

30:53.643 --> 30:55.437
That he was pushing alternative energy.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.606
Successfully pushing alternative energy.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.526
So oil companies, the Saudis,
even our own government,

31:01.610 --> 31:04.738
a lot of people stood to benefit
with Steadman out of the picture.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.742
Why did you wait till now
to take up this case?

31:09.659 --> 31:12.287
I thought he did it, like everybody else.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.624
I just hope it's not too late.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.461
It very well may be.
You need to prepare yourself for that.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.799
What about you?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.468
Why death penalty work?

My father did 15 years
for a crime he didn't commit.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.643

government gets you in their crosshairs

31:34.726 --> 31:37.646
you stand very little chance. That's why.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.198
(PRISONERS CHATTERING)

32:09.052 --> 32:10.512
- I want back in.
- Too late.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.389
I'll do anything you need.
See these hands?

32:12.472 --> 32:15.183
They're digging machines. You want to go
to China? I'll get you to China, Fish.

32:15.267 --> 32:19.396
I'll dig like a psychotic rodent if I have to.
Fish, I gotta be back in.

As of right now, there is no in.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.944
But you're gonna do something about it,
right? You're gonna get rid of him.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.654
I'll do what's necessary.

So, how you gonna do it?

32:33.785 --> 32:37.122

Someone's going to get hurt.

(PHONE RINGING)

32:46.256 --> 32:47.966
WOMAN: How did we miss this, guys?

32:48.049 --> 32:51.094
Scofield's father was out of the picture
by the time he was born.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.762
He took his mother's maiden name.

32:52.846 --> 32:56.725
All right, Scofield had no priors
and a full-time job as an engineer.

32:56.808 --> 32:57.809
<i>KELLERMAN'. Correct.</i>

32:57.893 --> 33:02.063
Then he goes and robs a bank,
discharging a gun in the process

33:02.147 --> 33:05.150
so that at sentencing
he could maneuver his way to Fox River

33:05.233 --> 33:08.570
<i>where his brother's scheduled to die
in less than a month.</i>

33:08.653 --> 33:10.280

With all due respect, brothers are
incarcerated together all over the country.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.411
It may just be a coincidence.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.455
Move on the younger brother.

33:18.538 --> 33:23.418
Do it preemptively before anything
rises up, bites any of us in the ass.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.339
GUARD: All right, let's move it along!
Let's look alive!

33:37.057 --> 33:38.433
It's a pathway.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.936
Where does it lead?

33:43.522 --> 33:44.981
Where are you taking me?

33:51.571 --> 33:52.822

34:01.248 --> 34:04.543
What? Son of a bitch. Open up on 40.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.547
He's got the pathway on his body.
It leads somewhere.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.839
Back off, Haywire.

34:09.922 --> 34:12.717
No, look. Look at his tattoos.
It's a pathway.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.136
Haywire, I said back off.
You want a hot shot?

34:15.219 --> 34:17.847

- Back off!

- It leads to hell!

Well, ain't that swell?

34:52.841 --> 34:55.302

don%you?

35:07.606 --> 35:10.025
- Good to be back, man.
- Good to have you back.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.365
So, when do we get started?

35:45.810 --> 35:47.062
Good afternoon, Mr. Scofield.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.188
MICHAEL: Hello.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.232
How you feeling today?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.234
Pretty good.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.363
What happened?

35:59.032 --> 36:01.242
Caught an elbow playing basketball.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.083
- Mind if I take a look?
- By all means.

36:17.175 --> 36:21.221
You know you're going to get killed
in here, right, if you're not careful?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.474
I'll make you a bet.

36:25.517 --> 36:30.271
When I get out of here alive,
I'll take you to dinner.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.193
Lunch. Cup of coffee.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.446
Michael, this charm act

36:39.364 --> 36:42.951
could be exactly what's getting you
into trouble out in the yard.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.124
Lean forward.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.803
All right,

37:01.886 --> 37:05.223
you went to the parking garage.
Terrence Steadman is already dead.

37:05.807 --> 37:09.269
- That's right.
- You saw that, and you ran. Took the gun.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.437
Dumped the gun.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.939
- Where?
- Storm drain. Van Buren and Wells.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.357
Nobody ever found it.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.153
What do you do after that?
You go back to your apartment?

37:18.653 --> 37:19.696
Yeah.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.201
<i>I was freaking out,
trying to figure out what had happened.</i>

37:26.161 --> 37:28.830
<i>Then I saw the bloody pants in the tub.</i>

37:32.584 --> 37:35.128
The cops, they busted in a minute
after I got there.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.964
The pants, the ones
with Steadman's blood on them.

37:38.047 --> 37:41.509
First cop on the scene says he saw you
washing them in the bathtub.

37:41.718 --> 37:45.054
He's lying. My hands were wet
after splashing water on my face.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.474
Police! Let's see your hands! Hands up!

37:48.683 --> 37:50.643
I never touched those pants.

37:51.561 --> 37:54.397
Which brings us back to the gun.
The one you said you dumped.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.816
It was planted.
It's the only way it could've got there.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.319
Ballistics matched it to a slug that was...

37:59.402 --> 38:02.572
The gun was planted, it was planted.
Just like the pants.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.366
Your fingerprints were all over the gun.

38:08.828 --> 38:09.829
Bo.

38:14.584 --> 38:17.545
- Who's Bo?
- He's the guy who arranged everything.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.966
<i>He had me come around the night before,</i>

38:22.050 --> 38:24.469
<i>tried a few guns, see which one felt right.</i>

38:24.594 --> 38:26.095
<i>And that was the setup right there.</i>

38:26.179 --> 38:27.806
<i>One of those
must've been the murder weapon.</i>

38:27.889 --> 38:30.517
Then that's how they got my fingerprints
on the gun.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.726
Had to be.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.063
NICK: All right, so this Bo,

38:35.146 --> 38:39.526
he coerces you into doing this,
all to clear a $90,000 debt?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.153
He was gonna kill my son.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.280
Well?

38:44.364 --> 38:47.116
A lot of "I didn't do its,"
and those don't count for much.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.911
The security tape, the one that shows
Lincoln pulling the trigger,

38:49.994 --> 38:51.204
-you've got it, right?
- Yeah.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.498
If Lincoln's telling the truth,
then that tape is lying.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.793
I think we should have a look.
Decide for ourselves.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.843
You're clear.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.654
If the chemicals
can eat through the iron pipes,

39:24.946 --> 39:27.532
how come they can't eat through
the toothpaste tube?

39:27.615 --> 39:31.202
It's only when the chemicals are
combined that they become a corrosive.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.539
- You studied chemistry or something?
- Not in school.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.516
But what you're doing up there
in the infirmary,

39:53.683 --> 39:56.144
what has that got to do
with what we're doing here?

39:56.227 --> 39:58.646
Getting through this wall
is just the beginning.

39:59.188 --> 40:03.109
There's a whole lot of real estate in
between here and the outside walls.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.487
The infirmary's the closest building
to those walls.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.996
And the weakest link in the security chain.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.706
Cool.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.590
I think I've removed enough grout
to bust through.
