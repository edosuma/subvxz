DON: I died on January 18, 1989.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.300
I was the father of three children.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.165
The husband of a wonderful wife.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.170
A man with a great future.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.322
I was 38 years old.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.049
You coming?

04:43.160 --> 04:44.889
Oh honey, you know.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.725
It's not gonna stop me from asking.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.220
I would feel so terrible
having six new students

04:52.320 --> 04:53.890
start with a substitute teacher.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.780
I still can't even convince
my wife to have a...

04:58.880 --> 05:01.326
A lovely weekend with her husband.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.246
We can sleep in, order room service...

05:10.360 --> 05:12.380
Room service?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.244
There probably isn't
room service, but...

05:15.760 --> 05:18.809
Okay, then, we could,
pick up some hamburgers

05:18.920 --> 05:20.490
and some strawberry milkshakes.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.620
Ooh...

05:21.720 --> 05:24.060
You're getting me. I'm listening.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.562
Get all cozy.
Put on some Love Me Tender.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.980
Love me tender

05:31.080 --> 05:33.128
Love me true

05:33.840 --> 05:34.966
Hi, Dad.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.081
Aw...

05:37.240 --> 05:38.810
I think we're in the Jailhouse Rock now.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.540
How you doing? Did you sleep well?

05:41.640 --> 05:42.700
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.165
- I think you're heavier.
- Um, yeah.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.980
- Did you grow again?
- Um, no.

IOU.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.001
Where's your brother at, huh?

05:52.120 --> 05:53.060
I don't know.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.844
- You don't know?
- No.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.565
I gotcha.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.380
- Good morning. How you doing?
- Good.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.686
Yeah?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.220
All right, guys,
there's not a lot of time.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.324
Nicole, no dogs eating
at the table, please.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.740
Thank you, darling.

06:10.840 --> 06:11.860
All right, guys,
there's not a lot of time.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.020
Eat your food real quick, please.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.963
Mom, I would love a cup of coffee.

(SCOFFS)

06:19.440 --> 06:22.380
Now, you know, Daddy's gonna be away
for a couple of days, so...

06:22.480 --> 06:24.980
DON: In January of 1989,

06:25.080 --> 06:29.300
I attended a church conference
in the Trinity Pines suburb of Houston,

06:29.400 --> 06:33.166
where the focus was on the growth
of the Union Baptist Church association.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.003
I went because I was seriously
considering starting a new church.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.121
We know that God is calling to us.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.530
To tell others about heaven
and how to go there.

06:49.080 --> 06:53.642
The gospel begins right here,
right where we are.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.330
And it travels.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.500
It travels to every neighborhood.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.170
Every continent.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.724
And the prize...

07:08.160 --> 07:09.161
Mmm.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.769
The prize that we shall receive

07:17.480 --> 07:19.244
is heaven.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.486
Amen?

07:24.840 --> 07:26.171
ALL: Amen.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.180
Amen.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.204
DON: Little did I know that some
of the people listening that day

07:32.200 --> 07:33.884
would be there to help me later on.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.060
You know you did something
Baptist preachers almost never do.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.161
Oh yeah, what's that?

07:40.280 --> 07:41.281
You finished early.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.241
(CHUCKLING)

07:43.680 --> 07:45.842
Well, good morning, J.V.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.380
It seems like I have
to walk to talk to you.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.620
If you walk the walk.

07:51.720 --> 07:56.700
I have to keep the ticker
on track since my heart attack.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.180
How's that going, by the way?

07:58.280 --> 07:59.486
A whole lot better, thank you.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.740
Oh, good.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.925
Rumor has it that you're thinking
about starting a new church?

08:06.680 --> 08:09.340
Well, you've started
so many successful churches.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.250
It's a roller-coaster ride,
beginning a new church.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.140
Three steps forward, two steps back.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.820
It's challenging.
Worthwhile, but challenging.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.500
I believe it's time for me
to start a new congregation.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.860
I would urge you to be certain

08:24.960 --> 08:27.980
that this is what God
really wants you to do.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.321
And that your family's
on board with the idea.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.650
Sometimes what inspires you

08:35.280 --> 08:37.419
isn't what you end up doing.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.841
It's about finding your purpose.

08:41.679 --> 08:42.659
Thank you.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.740
That's it.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.700
That's what it's all about.
Finding your purpose.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.121
And remember it's not about you.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.924
I appreciate that. Thank you, J.V.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.801
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

09:13.800 --> 09:14.801
It's 10:00.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.446
On the dime.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.841
How are you, darling?

09:20.640 --> 09:23.180
Grading papers. How's it going?

09:23.280 --> 09:24.281
Good, good.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.300
No matter where you are in the world

09:27.400 --> 09:30.324
you always manage to call me
at 10:00 every evening.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.045
Is it tradition or love?

09:34.480 --> 09:35.481
(EVA CHUCKLING)

09:36.040 --> 09:37.166
Love of tradition.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.041
Very nice.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.500
So, I had a good chat with J.V. Thomas
about opening a new church.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.100
He was very encouraging.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.420
I'd say there's a great chance that I can
actually start something this year.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.251
That's exciting. We're behind you 100%.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.820
I think I'm gonna have to
wrestle the twins to bed.

10:01.920 --> 10:02.900
I don't know.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.420
That might be the sound
of Nicole growing up.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.444
Oh, my. She'll be
a teenager soon enough.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.730
Well, she is ordering coffee now.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.121
That's right.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.220
Well, my love,
it's bedtime for all of us.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.340
All right, darling.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.740
Have a good night, and I miss you and
I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.966
I love you.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.241
I love you.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.960
Night, night.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.320
Good night.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.850
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

11:05.840 --> 11:08.161
DON: I remember that only
three weeks earlier...

11:08.640 --> 11:11.450
I'd received a traffic ticket
for not wearing a seatbelt.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.820
Until I received that ticket,
I'd not usually worn my seatbelt,

11:15.920 --> 11:18.207
but after that, well, I changed my ways.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.403
That small act would
be a crucial decision.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.362
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

12:07.880 --> 12:10.486
I believe in a great God.

12:12.680 --> 12:16.082
I believe in Jesus, the son of God.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.002
I believe in the Holy Spirit.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.420
I believe in baptism.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.460
I believe in communion.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.483
I believe in a great God.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.370
Ooh, Donnie, you're so beautiful.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.900
Can you hear me?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.660
DON: State law decreed that a coroner
had to pronounce me dead,

14:08.760 --> 14:11.460
before my body could be
removed from the wreck.

14:11.560 --> 14:16.060
There was no need for speed
because I was dead.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.605
EMT: I got no pulse.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.220
We got no pulse at all. All right?

14:26.320 --> 14:27.651
Does anyone want to call this thing?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.131
Yeah. I got it.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.646
EMT: Hey, we need to clean this mess up
so we can get this bridge open.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.282
Yeah, I got 12:15 now.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.609
According to the report,
the collision occurred at 11:45 a.m.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.921
EMT: Well, it's 1:00 p.m.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.524
Hey, what's going on up there?

15:23.840 --> 15:27.900
A truck crashed into a car
and another car over there.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.525
Multiple cars got hit.

15:36.840 --> 15:40.561
Officer, Dick Onerecker. I'm a minister.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.580
Is there anybody here I can pray for?

15:43.680 --> 15:45.569
Yeah, the people in those
two cars over there.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.405
They're shaken, but they're fine.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.931
You can talk to them if you'd like.

15:50.760 --> 15:55.260
What about the car up there?
The one with the tarp over it?

15:55.360 --> 15:57.860
The man in the red Ford is deceased.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.291
I'd like to pray for him.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.729
Well, like I said, he's dead.

16:03.880 --> 16:09.967
I know it sounds crazy,
but I have to pray for him.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.020
You know, if that's what
you want to do, go ahead,

16:13.120 --> 16:15.460
but I gotta tell you
it's an awful sight.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.820
He's dead,
and it's a real mess under that tarp.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.242
There's blood and glass everywhere,
and the body's all mangled.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.804
I gotta warn you, you do what you want,
but you've never seen anybody this bad.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.563
Try being a medic in Vietnam.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.251
I only know God told me to pray for you.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.680
He died instantly, there's no pulse.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.020
God, I pray...

16:55.120 --> 16:56.485
Yeah, that's what they
said when I got here.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.620
...that his sins are forgiven.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.100
We did everything we could,
but the impact probably killed him.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.725
And that he's with you, God.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.020
EMT: We need to get the jaws of life
ready for when the coroner gets here.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.246
Okay.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.002
I pray, God

17:12.880 --> 17:14.483
that he knew you.

17:17.760 --> 17:22.800
As father and as friend.

17:31.800 --> 17:38.729
What a friend we have in Jesus

17:40.320 --> 17:45.281
All our sins and griefs to bear

17:47.960 --> 17:54.844
All because we do not carry

He's alive! He's... He's alive!

18:15.520 --> 18:16.760
The man... The dead
man is singing in there!

18:16.880 --> 18:18.086
Really?

18:18.200 --> 18:21.500
You just set a world record
for exiting a wrecked car.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.601
Listen to me, he's alive!
The dead man...

18:22.720 --> 18:23.700
Look, sir...

18:23.800 --> 18:26.020
I know a dead guy when I see him.
That man is dead.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.020
Listen, he's alive. He was singing.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.100
We know our business, okay?

18:29.200 --> 18:30.180
Yeah.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.645
He's dead.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.140
Listen, look, look, look.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.300
I'm gonna lay down on this bridge.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.580
You're gonna have to run over me
if you don't go check on him.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.820
Just do me a favor.
Just check on his pulse.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.922
Please, just check
his pulse, that's all.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.860
- I'll check on him.
- Come on.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.291
Praise God!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.041
We got a pulse!

Yes!

19:05.160 --> 19:06.161
Come on! Let's go!

We got you.

Can you tell me your name?

20:55.800 --> 20:59.361
Now, you just stay with me.
Try to stay awake, okay?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.768
Please, sit down.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.045
Don's been in a wreck.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.364
What? A wreck?

21:29.640 --> 21:30.880
Easy.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.940
Airway looks clear.
We need to get two large 4-IVs in.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.088
Check in the airway.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.446
I'm so sorry.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.721
Thank you.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.521
Have you heard anything?

21:50.640 --> 21:51.641
No, nothing.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.220
Thank you.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.767
Let's cut that right sleeve.
Both IVs in there.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.730
And the BP cuff's
gotta go on there, too.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.085
Oxygen, thank you.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.420
Mr. Piper. Mr. Piper.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.922
We're going to do all we can
to save you, Mr. Piper.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.140
Don has been taken to the Huntsville
Memorial Hospital just off the I-45.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.740
WOMAN ON TELEPHONE: He's conscious.
She should probably speak to him now.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.140
It doesn't look good.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.446
Would you like to speak to Don?

22:23.600 --> 22:24.700
Yes, I would.

22:24.800 --> 22:29.740
We don't let people speak to patients
unless it's a grave situation.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.966
All right.

22:33.680 --> 22:34.740
Hello?

22:34.840 --> 22:39.205
He's unable to hold the phone himself
so I'm gonna put it up to his ear.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.125
Don? How are you?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.241
I'm so sorry that this happened.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.646
It's not your fault.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.366
I just wanted to come home, Eva.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.845
Please let me come home.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.329
Please let me go home.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.689
All right, thank you very much.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.604
They're doing an assessment.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.340
What do you mean... What is assessment?

23:22.440 --> 23:25.683
They need to assess his injuries
and try to stabilize him.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.041
There's a chance
that Don may move hospitals.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.525
I'll take the twins home with me, so you
don't need to worry about the boys.

23:33.640 --> 23:34.721
Thank you.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.566
Hey, I'm driving you to the hospital.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.841
No, no, that's...

23:39.920 --> 23:42.540
You don't have to. I want to drive you.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.380
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.460
DOCTOR: He's deteriorating rapidly.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.700
I don't think he's gonna
survive the afternoon.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.121
Put him in an ambulance
and take him to Houston.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.900
This facility isn't equipped.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.100
Don't you think we should
helicopter him to Hermann?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.620
No, nobody's flying in this weather.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.820
(SIREN WAILING)

23:56.920 --> 24:00.260
DON: As my condition
was deteriorating rapidly,

24:00.360 --> 24:03.180
it was decided to move me
by ambulance for the 80-mile trip

24:03.280 --> 24:05.820
back to Houston's Hermann Hospital,

24:05.920 --> 24:08.420
which had a much better trauma center.

24:08.520 --> 24:12.286
Still, I kept wondering
why God had brought me back.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.811
(GRUNTING)

24:13.920 --> 24:16.020
Hey, you gotta do something.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.740
You gotta... Medicine.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.046
You gotta give me some medicine, please.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.361
EMT: I've given you all I can.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.209
No, you gotta give me more.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.851
(SCREAMING)

24:43.440 --> 24:45.460
Ma'am? My name is Eva Piper.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.060
Has my husband Donald Piper arrived?

24:47.160 --> 24:48.500
He's in transit and
should be here any moment.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.180
- He's not here yet?
- No.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.123
He'll be coming in from
over there when he does.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.565
Don, Don, I'm here.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.340
They're gonna take good care of you.

24:58.440 --> 25:02.860
Listen to me, it wasn't your fault.
You're gonna make it.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.291
- Ma'am, we've gotta go.
- You're gonna make it.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.500
We need you to fill out
these insurance forms.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.681
Thank you.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.010
I know Don's date of birth.

25:24.960 --> 25:29.220
I don't know his social security
number or his insurance company.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.130
I don't know the amount
of the deductible.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.241
Don's always taken care of this.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.500
I don't have the answers to any of this.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.922
It's okay. It's okay.
These are the easy questions for now.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.980
All I know is that Don is supposed
to lead evening services.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.460
He's meant to preach tonight.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.085
They already have that covered.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.980
I don't know any of this.

25:52.080 --> 25:55.060
Ma'am, I filled out what
I could, but I don't...

25:55.160 --> 25:56.860
I don't have this information.
I'll get it to you tomorrow.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.420
That's okay.
We deal with this situation every day.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.010
Thank you.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.340
DON: It was heartwarming to know
that Eva had the support of our friends

26:14.440 --> 26:17.887
and fellow church members
in her hour of need.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.780
It's been over an hour.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.848
I can't stand the tension
of not knowing.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.300
I'm gonna find out what's happening.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.401
Eva, Eva...

26:37.520 --> 26:38.521
I need answers.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.740
- Doctor?
- May I help you?

26:44.840 --> 26:47.700
I'm trying to find out what's going on
with my husband, Donald Piper.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.529
No one's been out to see you yet?

26:49.680 --> 26:51.380
No, no one. I've heard nothing.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.580
I'm so sorry.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.968
I'm Tom Greider,
the orthopedic surgeon on this.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.020
Come on and I'll show
you what's going on.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.963
Your husband is very badly injured.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.050
We are doing everything
we can to save him.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.886
See this? It's not just broken,

27:10.880 --> 27:12.120
it's shattered.

27:13.040 --> 27:17.409
He's missing significant amounts
of bone structure, muscle and skin.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.740
That's his right knee.

27:20.840 --> 27:26.244
And this is where the left thigh
bone or femur should be.

27:27.800 --> 27:28.820
Should be?

27:28.920 --> 27:32.402
Well, he's missing
a significant amount of bone.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.280
Four and a half inches.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.966
Also, it seems that he
has a cracked pelvis.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.780
But we're just gonna let
that go for the time being

27:42.880 --> 27:46.340
'cause we have to deal
with these other injuries right away.

27:46.440 --> 27:51.780
As you can see, only this soft tissue
at the bottom part of his leg

27:51.880 --> 27:55.282
is connecting his whole lower
left leg to the rest of his body.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.208
Would you like to see him?

27:59.360 --> 28:01.340
Yes, I would.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.930
Well, come on.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.563
He won't respond to you.
He's heavily medicated.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.762
We couldn't give him anything
until we'd finished our examination.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.247
They're coming to
take him to surgery now.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.401
(EVA SNIFFLING)

29:23.840 --> 29:24.887
God...

29:28.920 --> 29:30.206
God help me.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.125
Please help us.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.330
(SOBBING) I'm so scared.

29:48.160 --> 29:53.610
You've always helped us.
Now please, please help us.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.410
Please help us.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.766
For I know the plans they have for you.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.769
Plans to prosper you.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.604
And to not harm you.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.920
To give you hope and a future.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.850
DON: Survival was going to be difficult

30:58.960 --> 31:02.931
because heaven was so glorious.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.440
Hi, Dad.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.441
Okay.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.651
Not good.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.805
I don't know.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.484
I don't know, Dad.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.886
I'll see you tomorrow with the kids.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.100
I just spoke to Don's parents.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.009
They aren't getting here
until the day after tomorrow.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.610
I love you, too. Bye.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.740
The reason you haven't heard from us
is 'cause we worked on him all night.

31:54.840 --> 31:55.900
All night?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.980
Eleven and a half hours.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.003
The good news is that there's no sign

32:00.120 --> 32:02.009
of brain damage or internal injury.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.049
We stabilized his left arm
and put his left leg in traction.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.291
We're taking good care
of your husband, Eva.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.844
He's gonna be okay.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.689
Thank you, Doctor.

32:16.440 --> 32:19.100
There are a lot of people
in the hospital chapel

32:19.200 --> 32:21.043
praying for Don right now.

32:24.520 --> 32:25.500
How you doing?

32:25.600 --> 32:26.601
Okay.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.045
I don't want you to
think about this now,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.202
but you should consider
hiring an attorney.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.100
DON: Enduring all that
I had to go through,

32:46.200 --> 32:47.725
nobody put up with more than Eva.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.780
She would rise every morning at 6:00.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.900
Rush to work at the school and afterwards
hurry back to my bedside

32:55.000 --> 32:57.401
where she stayed with me every night.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.204
It was the same stressful
routine day after day for her.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.241
GREIDER: You're seriously injured.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.441
We've done an MRI on you and it seems
you've escaped brain damage.

33:13.760 --> 33:17.162
I hurt more than I believe
is humanly possible.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.848
GREIDER: We can help you manage that.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.689
I just want relief.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.689
I understand.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.490
Your family's here to see you.

33:31.360 --> 33:35.180
DON: The hardest thing to
endure was having my family,

33:35.280 --> 33:38.807
especially my children,
seeing me in this physical state.

33:39.800 --> 33:40.847
EVA: Don...

33:42.280 --> 33:43.340
It's okay, boys.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.885
Say hi to your Dad.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.206
Nicole.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.689
I love you, Daddy.

I love you, Dad.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.886
Love you.

34:05.600 --> 34:10.242
I love you, Chris, so much.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.449
I have a Valentine's
Day dance coming up.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.081
I'm very excited.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.440
Although I don't know
if I have a Valentine.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.020
Daddy will dance with you.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.219
Two goals, Dad. That's what I got.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.340
One bounced off the pole.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.683
- Excuse me. It's time for some cleaning.
- Okay.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.820
I'll see you guys soon.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.300
Okay, bye.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.820
All right.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.100
Come on, guys.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.328
Go be with your grandparents
for a minute, okay?

34:45.400 --> 34:46.764
Be good boys.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.210
DON: See you guys soon.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.159
We have the best kids in the world.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.809
Yeah, we sure do.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.161
Hi. How y'all doing?

35:09.200 --> 35:11.168
You okay? Joe?

35:12.520 --> 35:14.420
Okay.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.409
Eva, I think the kids
should come home with us.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.260
We'll find a school for them close by.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.740
That way you won't have to worry about
if they're being taken care of or not.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.367
Yeah, and that way you can
focus fully on taking care of Don.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.660
Let me talk to Don first...

35:32.760 --> 35:34.340
I'm not sure if that's a decision
he can make right now.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.500
Dad!

35:35.600 --> 35:37.340
You live 250 miles away.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.940
We won't be able to see them every day.

35:39.040 --> 35:43.523
I know. I know it's gonna be tough,
but Don needs you now.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.841
And we can bring the kids
back anytime you want.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.451
It's best if I speak with Don.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.085
- All right.
- Okay.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.765
Hi.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.126
How you doing today?

36:08.800 --> 36:09.801
Mmm.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.166
EVA: How you feeling?

36:16.920 --> 36:21.607
My dad thinks it would be better for them
to take the kids back to Louisiana,

36:22.240 --> 36:24.163
at least until we can
get you out of the hospital.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.445
I don't think that's a very good idea.

36:31.880 --> 36:32.961
I know.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.540
But it'll be better for them.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.540
Because that way I don't have
to keep finding people

36:38.640 --> 36:41.610
to take them to school
and pick them up every day.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.340
Mmm. It's not a good idea, Eva.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.660
It's going to be impossible for me

36:48.760 --> 36:53.368
to return to teaching school
and maintain health insurance,

36:53.480 --> 36:57.405
spend time with you and find the energy
to take care of our children.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.971
No.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.445
Don...

37:06.640 --> 37:11.931
Letting my parents take the kids
is the only sensible solution we have here.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.201
Mmm.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.490
EVA: I want you to agree.

37:21.240 --> 37:24.130
I will find peace if we both agree
to let them go.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.689
(GROANING)

37:34.360 --> 37:36.601
I'm sending them home with my parents.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.682
Welcome to McDonald's.
Can I take your order?

38:31.840 --> 38:34.580
Hi, yes, we will have two cheeseburgers,

38:34.680 --> 38:37.700
two shakes and two fries, please.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.565
Thank you. Please go up to the window.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.568
DON: Until it was time
for me to come home,

39:19.680 --> 39:21.762
Eva would never sleep in our bed.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.460
And that couch was not comfortable.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.289
I know, 'cause I've been there.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.500
Yes, hello, my name is Eva Piper.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.570
I'm looking to hire an attorney.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.087
Mrs. Pepper?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.180
Piper.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.700
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm Cecil Beaumont.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.006
Pleasure.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.446
I am your Beau.

40:28.480 --> 40:31.165
Before we start,
can I ask you a question?

40:32.200 --> 40:33.460
Yes.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.688
How did you hear about me?

40:35.800 --> 40:38.929
Billboard.
There was a sign by a drive-thru.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.122
See there, a sign.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.481
Something we all need in a time
of uncertainty, don't you think?

40:52.280 --> 40:54.328
Your husband was hit by a State truck

40:54.440 --> 40:56.420
from the prison, is that right?

40:56.520 --> 40:58.045
- Yes.
- Cherry.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.210
Driven by an inmate?

41:03.360 --> 41:04.361
(CHORTLING)

41:04.480 --> 41:05.845
Cherry.

41:07.160 --> 41:11.260
Now, it's not illegal for them
to let an inmate drive a truck.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.940
But it shows poor judgment on the part
of those officials at the prison

41:15.040 --> 41:19.921
to let an untested,
inexperienced driver take control

41:20.760 --> 41:23.140
of an 18-wheel tractor trailer.

41:23.240 --> 41:26.528
Triple cherry, ka-ching, jackpot!

41:30.320 --> 41:32.561
Several of my friends are concerned

41:32.680 --> 41:34.940
that there might be
some kind of a cover-up

41:35.040 --> 41:38.089
or that the State of Texas will try
and deny who drove the truck.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.165
Well, your friends, are they attorneys?

41:44.280 --> 41:45.660
- No.
- Okay.

41:45.760 --> 41:49.287
Their legal advice is worth
what you paid for it, okay?

41:49.400 --> 41:53.164
There might be an attempt to alter the
circumstances surrounding the accident.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.647
I mean, that's more
likely what they'll do.

41:57.920 --> 42:01.540
You know, they're on the hook
for a pretty big claim here.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.060
So, I think, we can assume

42:04.160 --> 42:06.561
a pretty stout pushback
from the State of Texas.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.540
Do we have a case?

42:09.640 --> 42:10.641
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

42:10.880 --> 42:12.166
Excuse me.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.122
9-1-8 is Tulsa, isn't it?

42:20.480 --> 42:21.891
I'm sorry... You...

42:22.480 --> 42:24.220
Did you just ask, "Do we have a case?"

42:24.320 --> 42:27.140
Ma'am, I wouldn't be here
if there wasn't a case.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.700
I am your Beau.

42:29.800 --> 42:34.567
And "Mont," as in you have
a Mont-umental case.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.331
That's not that good, is it?

42:41.120 --> 42:42.406
"Mon" as in...

42:43.160 --> 42:45.162
You have a monster case.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.700
How about "Mont" as in...

42:50.800 --> 42:53.565
You have a case the size of Montana.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.340
These medical bills
are going to be astronomical,

42:57.440 --> 42:59.900
and you probably don't have
the resources to cover that, do you?

43:00.000 --> 43:01.843
No, we don't.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.721
How are the children doing?

43:09.320 --> 43:11.180
EVA'S DAD:
Who wants to say grace tonight?

43:11.280 --> 43:13.760
Nicole said it last night. Boys?

43:14.400 --> 43:15.420
Um...

43:15.520 --> 43:17.682
Joe? Chris?

43:20.600 --> 43:21.931
Chris, you go ahead. You're older.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.740
Like 10 minutes older.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.286
Well, then you have a head start, right?

43:28.320 --> 43:30.580
Thank you, Father,
for the food on our table,

43:30.680 --> 43:33.660
and please look over our dad,

43:33.760 --> 43:34.761
and...

43:35.200 --> 43:39.569
And for allowing me and my brother
to skip our homework tonight.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.643
Well, this father's not going
to allow that to happen.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.811
Oh, yes, you are.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.562
(DON MOANING)

44:19.760 --> 44:21.250
Can I help you?

44:23.040 --> 44:25.008
You sounded like you were in great pain.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.260
What are you talking about?

44:28.360 --> 44:29.885
You cried out.

44:34.240 --> 44:38.340
God, is this what you
brought me back for?

44:38.440 --> 44:41.523
(NURSE CHUCKLES)
Yes, dear, you came back to me.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.180
All right, breathe.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.645
Deep. Deep breath.

44:48.760 --> 44:49.966
Deeper.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.441

44:55.080 --> 44:56.081

44:56.280 --> 44:59.727
All right. Let's get you ready.

45:00.880 --> 45:01.961
For what?

45:02.080 --> 45:03.127
Taking a breath.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.970
You need to leave this on, all right?

45:15.400 --> 45:16.481
That's good.

I'm Dr. Houchins.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.928

45:46.360 --> 45:47.691
I won't be undefeated.

All right, let's get you
into a position to win.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.685
All right, take a deep breath.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.980
Don't give up now. Keep trying.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.660
Did you hear what I said?
Do it now! Breathe! Do it!

46:04.760 --> 46:06.660
Cough, breathe and cough. Do it!

46:06.760 --> 46:08.842
- Do it! Breathe...
- (DON GROANING)

46:10.120 --> 46:12.771
This is not a negotiation.
Do this right now. Breathe.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.681
(WHEEZING)

46:14.840 --> 46:16.126
I can't.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.940
All right. Don't do it.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.691
If you don't start breathing, and soon,

46:24.800 --> 46:27.780
I'm gonna have to
resort to a ventilator.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.060
You won't like that.

46:30.160 --> 46:33.300
DON: What Dr. Houchins
might have lacked in bedside manners,

46:33.400 --> 46:36.660
he made up for in sheer
bulldog determination.

46:36.760 --> 46:41.209
He simply wanted me to breathe.
And I had stopped trying.

46:54.280 --> 46:55.770
Don...

46:58.120 --> 46:59.610
You gotta breathe.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.847
Please, can you breathe? For me?

47:08.120 --> 47:09.929
You're not even trying.

47:13.720 --> 47:14.926
Breathe!

- He's this way.
- How are you doing?

47:46.960 --> 47:48.121
Well enough.

47:54.440 --> 47:59.020
Don's just through here. He's stable.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.900
BILLIE: I can't... I just can't. No.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.900
EVA: Okay, that's okay. It's all right.
Here, come with me. Come here.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.260
DON: I knew my mother would have the most
difficult time seeing me in this condition,

48:11.360 --> 48:15.540
and never entered my room during
the entire stay in the hospital.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.460
No mother would want
to see her son like that.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.540
I've got to make this phone call, okay?
I'll be right back.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.380
EVA: David, I don't know what to do.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.420
His mom can't even be
in the same room with him.

48:25.520 --> 48:26.726
She's devastated.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.081
He's not gonna make it
unless something happens.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.449
You and Cliff are Don's best friends.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.900
He won't breathe.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.490
He refuses to breathe.

48:38.200 --> 48:41.220
You're the only other person
in the world who will make him listen.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.740
All right, I'll be
there as quick as I can.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.649
Probably around three hours.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.525
Thank you.

48:56.840 --> 48:59.260
DON: An American hero of three wars.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.340
World War II, Korea and Vietnam,

49:02.440 --> 49:03.851
that was my father.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.850
Son,

49:25.480 --> 49:31.522
I'd give anything to
trade places with you.

50:00.240 --> 50:04.131
David, thank you for coming.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.444
It's this way.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.080
DON: David Gentiles was my best friend.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.980
Like myself, he was an ordained minister

50:13.080 --> 50:16.607
who was, by far, the most
loving human being I had ever known.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.290
You're gonna make it.

50:49.040 --> 50:51.691
You have to make it.
You've made it this far.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.561
I don't know that I want to make it.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.420
You have to.

50:59.520 --> 51:02.763
Not for yourself,
then hold on for us, Don.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.650
(WHEEZING)

51:06.720 --> 51:08.290
I'm tired.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.642
I fought all I can

51:16.880 --> 51:18.820
and I'm ready to die.

51:18.920 --> 51:20.604
Well, then you won't have to do a thing.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.884
We'll do it for you.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.330
We won't let you die.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.530
Do you understand that, Don?

51:40.760 --> 51:43.001
We're gonna pray all night.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.726
I'm gonna call everybody
I know who can pray.

51:49.280 --> 51:52.682
I want you to know that all
of us who care about you,

51:53.360 --> 51:57.206
will be up all night in prayer for you.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.048
We're taking over from here.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.409
We're gonna take care of this.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.561
He's in bad shape.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.920
Emotionally, there's no will to live.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.882
What is there left for us to do?

52:33.200 --> 52:34.406
Pray.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.620
DON: We all have talents.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.609
David's was organizing.

52:40.280 --> 52:44.524
He was able to rally churches
from all over the world to pray for me

52:44.640 --> 52:46.244
simply by faxing them.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.009
How long will my dad be like this?

53:53.920 --> 53:56.651
Well, it's gonna take some time to heal.

53:59.840 --> 54:02.500
All I do is press my palms together.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.380
It's not doing anything.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.180
It's not making my mom happier,
or my dad better.

54:07.280 --> 54:09.601
Well, honey, you gotta keep praying.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.580
You know what they say about faith.

54:12.680 --> 54:15.220
You can have hope without faith,

54:15.320 --> 54:17.800
but you can't have faith without hope.

54:20.040 --> 54:21.769
Grandma loves you.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.500
I love you, too.

54:23.600 --> 54:26.763
My sweet baby,
I want you go to sleep now, okay?

54:27.920 --> 54:30.321
I love you. I'll see you in the morning.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.401
Eva.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.365
Morning, Doctor.

54:45.880 --> 54:48.247
Don has developed pneumonia
in both lungs.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.530
If we can't do something
about his breathing,

54:50.640 --> 54:53.007
we're gonna have to
do something else drastic.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.166
How drastic?

55:00.080 --> 55:03.209
The Ilizarov device stabilizes

55:03.760 --> 55:07.420
and then at the same time,
if successful, which is a huge if,

55:07.520 --> 55:11.047
what it does is it stretches
the bone by pulling on both ends.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.740
See, new bone is created

55:14.840 --> 55:18.765
by actually breaking the leg above
and below the original breaks.

55:19.760 --> 55:24.300
We push the broken ends
closer and closer together

55:24.400 --> 55:27.927
until they meet and then
they form a new femur.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.620
- Will that work?
- That's just it.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.768
I can't guarantee that it'll work.

55:36.080 --> 55:38.660
We can't give him the kind of
breathing treatments he needs

55:38.760 --> 55:40.762
as long he's in the prone position.

55:41.320 --> 55:42.980
See, we have to elevate him.

55:43.080 --> 55:45.820
And that leaves us with two choices.

55:45.920 --> 55:50.130
One is that we amputate the leg.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.860
And the other is that we try
this Ilizarov device,

55:54.960 --> 55:57.042
which is called the fixator.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.740
People take sometimes
months of counseling

56:01.840 --> 56:04.605
before they allow this device
to be used on them.

56:05.360 --> 56:08.125
And of course, in Don's case,
we don't have that kind of time.

56:08.440 --> 56:11.125
But there is a chance to save the leg?

56:12.080 --> 56:13.411
There is a chance.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.489
May I have a moment, please?

56:21.640 --> 56:22.846
Of course.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.368
(BOYS LAUGHING)

56:51.480 --> 56:53.482
I didn't realize you were home.

56:54.320 --> 56:57.100
Brought the kids
by to pick up a few things.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.010
It doesn't feel like a home.
There's no, "Hi, Mom."

57:00.840 --> 57:02.683
Eva, it's gonna get better.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.444
But how much worse?

57:06.360 --> 57:08.140
We can't pay for anything.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.288
This house is a mess.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.260
He might not come home.

57:13.360 --> 57:14.964
Will he even survive?

57:16.160 --> 57:17.764
He might never walk again.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.410
I'm so afraid.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.770

(GROANING)

58:08.560 --> 58:10.403
It's a bone-growth device.

58:12.400 --> 58:16.060
What is that?

58:16.160 --> 58:17.241
A fixator.

58:18.040 --> 58:21.840
Dr. Greider says it's the only chance
we have to save your leg.

58:22.320 --> 58:24.926
Okay? Shh...

58:25.920 --> 58:28.764
And those rods go all
the way through my leg?

- It's a new...
- And my arm?

58:32.640 --> 58:34.290
It's a new technique.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.460
I believe it's worth the risk.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.801
Why did you let them do this to me?

Huh?

these were the only fireworks

59:08.120 --> 59:09.940
DON: Eva's decision to keep my leg

59:10.040 --> 59:14.011
was so that I could continue to enjoy
skiing and biking with the children.

I spoke to her that day.

Good morning, Doctor.

A few months.

How few?

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.367
Many months. Maybe more.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.922
You mean possibly a few years?

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.045
A year maybe. I really don't know.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.847
And there's no guarantee that I'm gonna
be able to keep these limbs?

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.140
No guarantee.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.608
You could develop an infection
and we'd have to amputate the leg.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.580
So, I could endure this for months
and still end up with no leg?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.570
I'm hoping your left
arm has a better chance.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.571
We took bones from your right pelvis
and put them into your left forearm.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.168
It's kinda of like taking core samples

for oil, as an example.

We're going to have to move
Mr. Piper to Saint Luke's tomorrow.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.765
Why do we have to move him?

I believe Don should
be able to stay here.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.081
I agree.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.924
But this is out of my hands.

I've done everything I know
to prevent this from happening.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.250

at the hospital.

Our insurance no longer
covers Don's treatment here.

What about our case? Our settlement.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.740
Well, I've got good news
and I've got bad news,

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.580
but the bad news takes out the good news,
so all we're left with really is bad news.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.841
What?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.644
Well, in Texas, state employees
are indemnified by the State of Texas.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.244
Okay, how does this affect us?

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.620
Well, the State, in this case, Texas,

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.725
has put a cap on all damages
that are able to be collected

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.529
in any lawsuit against the State.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.567
And the cap is $250,000.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.885
Now, insurance companies,
they have subrogation rights.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.603
Which means that
they're gonna put a lien

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.860
against any kind of claim and settlement

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.900
or any funds received from a lawsuit
to cover their medical expenses.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.081
In other words,

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.969
your insurance company
is gonna take all the money.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.725
Don will receive nothing?

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.820
No.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.660
You know, I had a friend one time,
he asked me,

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.683
he said, "What kind of cookies you bake

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.689
"when you don't have any money?"

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.921
I said, "I don't know, what?"

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.565
He says, "Shortbread."

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.940
Unfortunately, Don's gonna have to
bake shortbread cookies on this one.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.540
He'd have been better off if he'd
been hit by a Budweiser truck.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.167

about millions of dollars.

was only five blocks away,

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.926
it was such a painful move
with the fixators on my leg and arm.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.009

Or see the children get married.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.531
You don't care.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.247
You can take your pain away
with that button,

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.685
but you are causing it to everyone else.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.048
(SOBBING)

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.770
Welcome to McDonald's.
Can I take your order?

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.445
(SCREAMING)

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.045
(SCREAMING)

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.841
(SIGHING)

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.364
Sorry, that's not on the menu.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.521
(GROANING)

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.251
Lord...

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.091
Oh, God,

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.681
does it really have to be like this?

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.841
The pain of the injuries,

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.644
I can handle that.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.460
Even seeing the pity
and the helplessness

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.963
in the eyes of the people
who love me and care for me,

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.043
I can get through that.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.166
But if this is as good
as it's ever gonna get...

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.568
I don't want to be a burden.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.485
I was just trying to get back to Alvin,
and you took me to heaven.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.003
Why can't you take me back?

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.126
Now.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.129
I want to go back to heaven.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.731
My home.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.242
My home is heaven now.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.763
Oh, Jesus, let me come
back home, please!

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.048
Please let me come back home.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.121
(DOOR OPENING)

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.970
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.980
Well, South Park hired
me to be your interim

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.060
while you're incapacitated,

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.164
so I guess you can say
I'm out of retirement.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.242
Can I get you a magazine?

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.524
Would you like a milkshake?

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.500
How about a hamburger?

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.887
You lost quite a bit of weight, son.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.128
Would you like for me to read
to you from the Bible?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.620
Or any other book, for that matter.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.449
Really, no.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.125
Thanks for coming.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.562
You know, you really need
to get your act together.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.406
Sir?

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.980
You need to get your act together.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.321
You're not doing
a very good job right now.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.260
I'm not sure I understand.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.523
Besides that, you're a raging hypocrite.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.201
(DON SCOFFS)

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.260
I don't know what you're talking...

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.100
You got all these people
out there who care so much for you

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.300
and you have no idea
how much they love you.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.820
- I know they love me.
- Oh, really?

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.980
Yeah.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.764
Well, you're doing a pretty poor job of

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.540
letting them know
you're aware of that fact.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.085
I don't think you're
treating them right.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.649
Now, they can't heal you,

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.084
but they would heal you if they could.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.060
And if they could trade places with you,
many of them would do that.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.340
- Yeah...
- And do anything for you without any waver.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.363
I don't want them to do anything.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.060
Truth is, I don't even
want them to be here.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.242
I'd just as soon they not come.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.620
I know it's inconvenient.
They must have better things to do.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.131
I know that!

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.641
Why would I want anyone
to come see me like this? Huh?

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.961
It's awful!

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.209
It's not your call.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.645
It's not about you.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.808
You spent the better part of your life
trying to minister to other people.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.323
Trying to be there for their needs.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.540
And to be there for them
through difficulty and tragedy.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.060
I've tried to.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.802
And yet you have deprived them
of doing the same thing for you.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.004
And that's all they
have to offer you, Don.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.380
And you're taking
that gift away from them.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.084
I appreciate them.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.408
I do. I know they want to help
and I think that's very fine and all, but...

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.681
But nothing!

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.526
Now, I want you to let them in,
you hear me?

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.690
You're going to let them in

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.960
and let them help you.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.406
I can't.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:37.122
Well, if you don't feel
like you can for yourself,

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.170
what about doing it for me?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.300
What about next time somebody
walks through that door

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.131
and wants to do something for you,
I don't care what it is,

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.046
say yes.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.884
Let a few folks

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.690
express their love
by doing something for you.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.961
I mean, promise me that you'll do that.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.721
Just...

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.686
Look.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.885
Try it for me.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.568
You're gonna need to get better at this.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.125
Now, this is one of the lessons
that God wants you to learn.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.524
All right, I promise.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:28.327
People are God's
hands to meet your needs

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.524
and answer your prayers.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.180
We'll just keep looking
till it feels right.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.123
What kind of house are we looking for?

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.560
Well...

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:50.441
Probably something one story,
manageable to get around in for Dad.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.603
Is Dad gonna be a wheelchair?

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.121
Yeah. For a little while.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.620
DON: As the medical bills were mounting,

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.700
Eva looked for a house
that we could afford,

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.521
that would accommodate my needs
once I was discharged from Saint Luke's.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.961
Hey, hey, hey, there he is.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.325
Got something for you.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.841
(CHUCKLING)

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.807
Look, let me do it.
Looks like you need my help.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.486
How are you today?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.490
Not speaking to me again?

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.860
Okay. It's a letter.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.180
It says, "Hi, there, we share wrenches.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.762
"Fortunately for both of us,
our fixators are interchangeable.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.660
"And we can borrow
tools from one another."

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.286
That's so cute. Look at that.
It's a happy face.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.100
Who is this?

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.725
Oh, this is from Christy.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.500
Christy is a teenage girl
that lives in the next room.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.940
She was born with one leg
shorter than the other.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:56.260
So, she had to have surgery to attach
the Ilizarov frame like yours

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.328
so that both legs
would be of normal size.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.540
She has a fixator too?

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.641
She goes on.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.820
"And we share something else too. Pain."

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.500
She says, "I hear you scream at night
sometimes, as you probably hear me too.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.809
"Although our nurse says
that you don't admit to it."

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.121
(CHUCKLING)

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.340
Don't... Don't... Don't shoot me now.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.442
I'm just the messenger, Mr. Piper.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.420
And she goes on and says,

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.047
"You're not alone. Sincerely, Christy."

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.124
That is so sweet.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.006
Can you get me a pen and paper please?

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.368
I can if you acknowledge me.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.166
There you go.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.051
I like that.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.940
All right. I'll be right back.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.201
That's my boy.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.540
"Dear Christy,

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.300
"in some of my worst moments
of self-pity,

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.801
"I think of never being normal again.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.820
"I believe that when
all of the pain is over,

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.140
"Christy, you will be
a normal young woman.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.643
"You will play and run and do everything
a normal teen can do.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.369
"You're doing something that positively
impacts the rest of your life.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.365
"Keep the faith.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.929
"Kindest, Don.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.441
"P.S.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.764
"If God brings you to it,
He will bring you through it."

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.100
It's not long before you go home.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.885
This is your first step
in that direction.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.891
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.201
Mmm.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.209
My first step is wanting to vomit.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.644
Yeah, nausea will get you every time.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.940
Your equilibrium has changed.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.520
You've grown used to being
in a horizontal position.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.326
I'd like my tools back.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.364
Hi, I'm Christy, your long-lost pen pal.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.881
Or Hopalong Cassidy, as my friends say.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.281
DON: Hi.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.605
I'm Don.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.300
How are you?

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.731
Could be worse.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.726
How's that?

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.440
Okay, you got me.
It can't get much worse.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.850
The endless reruns
of The Brady Bunch at 3:00 a.m.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.060
Yeah, well, I wish
my only problem was getting

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.162
hit in the face with
a football like Marcia.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.366
I'd take a broken nose to dance normal.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.931
You'll dance.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.420
Only the truest friends show up
when you have to move.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.540
Trust me, this is a vacation.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.580
Oh, vacation?

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.170
Yes, from my children.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.611
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.531
Well, thank you.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.900
Remember when Don's parents
gave us this painting?

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.860
Oh, yes, I remember.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.407
I remember you tried to pawn it
off on me and then Susan and...

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.820
And the Goodwill store.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.420
That's not true!

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.521
That is true.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.681
And never told Don.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.488
Is all this stuff going
to fit in the new house?

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.220
(SIGHS) I think so.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.940
This place just
isn't gonna work for Don.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.780
You know, with all the stairs
and him being in a wheelchair.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.565
Plus, the new home is
closer to the church.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.565
That will be nice.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.729
Just came by to check on you.
See how you were doing.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.361
You're looking good.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.007
I hear you're gonna be
going home before long.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.882
Anything I can do for you before I go?

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.683
That's a very fine offer. Um...

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.085
I wish I had a magazine to read.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.930
You do, really?

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.480
I think so.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.923
I haven't read one in a while.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.527
Well, all right. Give me just a minute.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.980
DON: Jay B. Perkins, a retired minister,

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.020
was a powerful father figure to me.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.969
And I was grateful for his service
to my church while I was incapacitated.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.885
This ought to do ya.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.780
There you go.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.211
- Thank you much. I'll...
- That'll keep you busy.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.771
- I'll read them a bit later.
- Yeah.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.044
Anything else I can do?

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.971
No, that's... That's all I need.
Thank you.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.080
You know, when you open the door

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.580
and let somebody do
something nice for you,

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.206
turns out not to be
so hard after all, huh?

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.050
You were right, Jay B.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.020
I thought that

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.060
relieving people of the responsibility
of having to care for me

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.128
was the right thing to do.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.565
It wasn't.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.489
They would heal me if they could

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.244
and since they can't do that,
they were caring for me in...

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.609
In the only way that they can.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.290
I have denied them the...

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.602
The blessing of caring.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.487
You've loved me enough
to tell me the truth.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.005
I won't forget it.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.810
And I never have.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.802
After 34 surgeries

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.086
and nearly four months in the hospital,

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.940
Dr. Greider said I could go home.

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.405
Bye, thank you.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.927
Dr. Greider.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.451
Hold up a second.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.331
Tell me something.

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.842
Just how bad was I when they
brought me in the night of the accident?

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.605
I've seen worse.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.760
But they didn't live.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.260
Thank you, sir.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.420
He would become a friend
of mine from that day forward.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.780
- Bye, Christy.
- Bye.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.211
I want you to call me
when you get out of here.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.800
Will do.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.362
(CHILDREN LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.401
Hi, Daddy!

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.171
Hey, Dad!

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.608
How do you like the new house?

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.580
What do you think?

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.047
Welcome home, Daddy, welcome home.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.447
I think I'm home.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.009
There's the kitchen.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.807
Did you put milk in it?
I'm just gonna do this.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.001
I know.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.971
- Is it good?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.524
Smells good in there.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.820
EVA: Why don't you...
We're gonna play a game.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.285
Okay, you ready?

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:23.060
DON: Eva organized something
called the Don Patrol.

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.500
A group of church members
and friends who took care of me

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.251
so that she could teach
and we could keep our insurance.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.127
The Don Patrol would arrive around 9:00
while I was still sleeping.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.700
Good morning.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.848
I might awake to see one of the Susans

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.042
knitting on the couch
at the end of my bed.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.125
Or someone would be there with
a toothbrush so I could brush my teeth.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.020
Looking good.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:51.966
Often times holding the glass of juice
before I was done doing that.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.860
Maybe even offering an electric shaver.

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.691
All right, I've never actually
used one of these before.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.645
It's pretty simple.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.242
- You know what, it doesn't actually work.
- (LAUGHING)

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.220
And a big lunch.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.380
Turkey sandwich,

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.165
oatmeal cookie, pickles.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.420
You can't pass up baby pickles.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.249
- I'll take the apple.
- Okay.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.220
Another friend might be
reading the newspaper,

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.606
ready to entertain me.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.900
Yeah, whatever you need.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.048
I'll even sing for you if you want.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.003
Some guests would even make
themselves quite comfortable.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.740

Uh-huh.

You sure?

01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:59.767
Yeah.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.370
It smells like pee in here.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.482
I know. It was the dog.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.087

This is a perfect day.

God has given me children
so much better than I deserve.

- I don't think I can.
- Please?

David!

What are you doing here?

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.060
I'm in town for a discipleship weekend.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.404
It's the excuse I use to come into
the house and spend time with you.

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.322
Thank you for your friendship.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.684
And your relentless
commitment to prayer.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.409
Of course, Don. How you feeling now?

01:35:58.640 --> 01:35:59.846
In pain.

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.060
But I'm always in pain.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.164
That's... That's not the worst
part of it for me right now.

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.170
There are things
I can't physically do anymore.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.250
I'm not sure that God wants me
to continue at South Park.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.801
I feel loved and needed there,

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.888
but I'm not sure it's where I should be.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.809
What did you learn from your accident
and your recovery experience?

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.123
Letting other people inside.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.409
Allowing others to help me.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.403
But in the midst of
all the suffering and despondency,

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.726
David,

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.565
I've learned that heaven is real.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.566
What do you mean by that?

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.890
I died that day.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.162
The next moment, I stood in heaven.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.767
Why haven't you mentioned this before?

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.420
(SIGHS)

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.522
I have two very good reasons for that.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.243
Number one, I go around talking
about having been to heaven,

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.540
people will think I'm nuts.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.660
Why would you think that?

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:41.807
- You just told me.
- Number two...

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.086
- I don't think you're nuts.
- Number two.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.488
I don't want to go over
that experience again.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.807
It's too personal, too special.

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.963
It's my sacred secret.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.645
Is it possible that God
took you to heaven,

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.540
brought you back,

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.120
so that you could share
your experience with others?

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:09.440
Don't you realize what a powerful
encouragement you could be?

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.243
I want you to make a covenant with me.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.930
What kind of a covenant?

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.300
It's simple.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.220
Find someone you trust.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.420
Share a little bit about your story
just to gauge their response.

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.808
If they think you're crazy
or you hallucinated,

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.168
I promise, I promise
you never have to talk about it again.

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.564
But if they rejoice with you

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.684
and urge you to tell them more,
I want you to take it as a sign.

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.688
A sign that God wants you to talk about
those 90 minutes you spent in heaven.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.170
I think I can do that much.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.686
When?

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.841
Soon.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.460
I promise.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.800
Very soon, right?

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.005
All right, very soon.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.683
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, darling.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.683
Hey, David. Glad you could make it.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.050
Soon as in now.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.740
DON: Honey?

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.921
Yes.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.968
Darling, I want to tell you something.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.040
What's that?

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:45.686
Remember the day
I left for the convention?

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.841
EVA: Uh-huh.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.762
Well, that morning just plays
over and over in my head.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.042
And you said, "I owe you."

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.130
Yes. And I do.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.011
Well, in fact, I think I owe you.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.820
Oh, don't I know it.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.809
I've been waiting a long time for that.

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.368
I owe you an explanation.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.447
Darling, would you
sit down for a second?

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.321
Please.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.684
You know, I died in that accident.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.845
When I woke up,

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.245
I was in heaven.

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.565
You went to heaven?

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.961
Yes.

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.484
Tell me more.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.883
When I died,

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.965
I didn't flow through
a long dark tunnel or...

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.841
I had no sense of fading
away or coming back.

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.290
I heard no voices calling to me
or anything like that.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.482
Simultaneous with my last recollection
of seeing the bridge,

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.811
the rain,

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.726
a light enveloped me

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:42.207
with a brilliance beyond earthly
comprehension or description.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.803
In my next moment of awareness,

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:51.247
I was standing in heaven.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.569
It was perfect.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.045
And I knew right then I would have
no needs and never would again.

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.007
I didn't even think of Earth
or of those left behind.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.211
Though I did not see Jesus face-to-face,

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.780
I did sense his presence at every turn.

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.780
And I did see people I had known.

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.580
As they surged towards me,

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.446
I knew instantly that all of them
had died during my lifetime.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.327
Their presence seemed
absolutely natural.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.780
It was as if God had removed
anything negative or worrisome

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.370
from my consciousness.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.566
And I could only rejoice at being together
with these wonderful people.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.164
Donnie, I'm so excited
you're here to join us.

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.570
DON: I saw Papa.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.886
You know, my grandfather
that everyone called Joe.

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.361
I heard his voice and felt his embrace.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.820
I'd been with him when he'd
suffered a heart attack at home

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.685
and had ridden with
him in the ambulance.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.180
I'd been standing just outside
the emergency room at the hospital

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.487
when the doctor walked out and faced me.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:06.180
The doctor shook his
head and said softly,

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.009
"We did everything we could."

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.500
As I walked among them,

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:15.763
I became aware of
the wide variety of ages.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.446
Old and young and every age in between.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.380
Many of them hadn't known
each other on Earth,

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.290
but each had influenced
my life in some way.

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.802
Even though they hadn't met on Earth,

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.407
they seemed to know each other now.

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:37.163
One person in the greeting committee
was Mike Wood, my childhood friend.

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.100
He was a popular kid
and became a hero to me

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.444
because he lived the Christian lifestyle
and often talked about it.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.963
After high school, Mike received a full
scholarship to Louisiana State University.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.801
When he was 19,
Mike was killed in a car wreck.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:59.326
When I attended his funeral,
I wondered if I would ever stop crying.

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.367
I couldn't understand why God
had taken such a dedicated disciple.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.140
Through the years since then,

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.562
I had never been able to forget
that pain and sense of loss.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.580
Then I saw Barry Wilson who had been
a classmate in high school,

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.648
but later drowned in a lake.

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.366
Barry's smile radiated a happiness
I didn't know was possible.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.251
And I saw my great-grandmother,
Hattie Mann.

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:32.889
As a child, I knew her only after
she had developed osteoporosis.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.700
Her head and her shoulders
were always bent forward

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:38.531
giving her a sort of humped appearance.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:42.767
But the beautiful thing is
she didn't carry these burdens in heaven.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.420
Heaven was many things,

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.731
but without a doubt it was
the greatest family reunion of all.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.043
A holy awe came over me
as I stepped forward.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.928
I had no idea what lay ahead.

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.451
But I sensed that with each step I took,
it would grow more wondrous.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.490
And I heard the music.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.327
I can only describe it
as a holy swoosh of wings.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.140
But I'd have to magnify that
thousands of times

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.891
to explain the effect
of the sound in heaven.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.969
It was the most beautiful
and pleasant sound I'd ever heard.

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:29.442
I saw a bright iridescence.

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.562
I peered through the gate
yearning to see what lay beyond.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.282
It wasn't an anxious yearning,

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.760
but a peaceful openness to experience

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.321
all of the grace and joy of heaven.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.087
At that very moment,
I was about to realize

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:47.441
the yearning of every human heart.

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:52.450
I was in heaven, ready to go
through the pearlescent gates.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:00.100
Then, just as suddenly
as I'd arrived at the gates of heaven,

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.611
I left there.

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:07.889
I spent a lot of time in the hospital
trying to make sense of all of this.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.567
I was paralyzed by the notion
of not wanting to return.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.042
I mean, why come back to this much pain?

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.810
I think now I know.

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.121
I do, too.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.249
I believe it's time for me
to go back to church.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.642
I believe that, too.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.251
Have you told anyone else about this?

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.211
Yes. David.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.287
Are you hurt that I
didn't tell you first?

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:01.731
No.

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.241
I feel elated to know.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.965
Because it enables me to understand
the man to whom I'm married.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.161
Eva...

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.001
Yes.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.047
Eva,

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.843
no one should have to do the things
that you had to do for me.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.966
But you did them,

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:31.283
faithfully, compassionately
and without hesitation.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.780
You come closest

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.407
to really knowing how painful
this journey has been for me.

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.005
Each day

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.210
you endured it with me.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.521
Eva,

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.404
you are my gift from God.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.089
DON: I was so enthusiastic about
finally returning to South Park.

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.500
I hadn't been out of bed for more
than an hour at a time, and,

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.762
well, I overestimated my endurance
and suddenly felt incredibly fatigued.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:31.980
Yet, the overwhelming response
from the congregation gave me

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.700
a new burst of strength.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.603
And I knew right then that their praise
was for God's work and my healing.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.610
It's only taken me

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.260
five months

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.603
to get from the conference
at Trinity Pines back to church.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.007
I may be slow, but I'm faithful.

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.601
(EXHALING)

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:02.020
They would like for you to say
something to the congregation.

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.140
Eva, I think I made a mistake.
I don't think I can do this.

01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:06.241
You can.

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.340
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.646
You are.

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.366
MAN: Let's hear it, Don.

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.087
WOMAN: Say something, Don, please.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.011
You prayed.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.645
I'm here.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:19.860
There he is.

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:22.122
Hey, Don! Don!

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.726
Hey!

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.940
- You've made it.
- Yeah.

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:29.565
It's so good to see you.

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.100
I believe that I'm alive today
because you prayed me back to Earth.

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.282
Tell you what.
You buy me lunch, we'll call it even.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:38.420
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:39.460
All right, it's a deal.

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:40.561
EVA: That's right.

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.808
I couldn't figure out how to get inside,

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.048
so I just pried open the trunk,

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:48.380
knocked down the back seat
and crawled in that way.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.245
But even when I was praying with you,
I didn't know it was you.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.409
Besides, no one lives through that.

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.690
Well, in my first
moments of consciousness,

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.131
two things stand out.

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.526
First,

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.888
- I was singing.
- (ALL CHUCKLING)

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.400
- I don't sing.
- No.

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.408
What a Friend We Have in Jesus.

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:16.326
And the second was that Dick
had climbed into the car with me

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:20.285
and his hand had gripped mine
and held it tight.

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:24.100
But the one thing that is absolutely
clear was Dick being in the car

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:25.620
and praying with me.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.167
That's true. He did get
in the car and prayed with you.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.489
But, Don, he never held your hand.

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:37.721
Nope.

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:42.003
I remember it so clearly, though.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:45.283
It was one of the most vivid details.

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:48.529
ANITA: It didn't happen.
It was physically impossible.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:53.928
There's just no physical way possible
I could have reached your right hand.

01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:59.521
But...

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:02.420
But I swear, I...

01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.887
ANITA: Someone was holding your hand.

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.086
But it wasn't Dick.

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:12.969
DON: Dick Onerecker was a real prayer
warrior before and after the accident.

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.380
He would pass away only a few years

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:17.209
after praying for me on that bridge.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.810
Okay, you guys, right in here.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.364
- Hey, darling. Darling. Darling.
- Yeah?

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:51.691
- I'll be right back.
- EVA: Okay.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.925
Boy, that really hurts, doesn't it?

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:16.887
Yeah, it hurts very much.

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.446
Yeah, I know.

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.044
Believe me, I know.

01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:26.961
You do?

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:29.888
Yeah. I had one, too.

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:34.526
It's horrible.

01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.444
It's just horrible.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.289
It's awful, I know that.

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.566
I wore one on my left leg for 11 months.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:45.965
Nobody ever understands.

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.411
Well, they can't.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:52.089
It's not something you can talk about
and have anyone understand your pain.

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.049
- I'm Don.
- I'm Mark.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.610
Well, Mark,

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.925
you just met someone
who does understand the pain

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.281
and the discouragement
you're going through.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.900
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.002
Oh... You'll make it.

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.770
You're gonna make it. Hey.

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.644
Hey, trust me. You'll make it.

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.125
What happened?

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.651
I had a skiing accident.

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.444
You're a football player?

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:33.280
Yes, sir.

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:36.449
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:40.647
One day, you will walk again.

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.204
You might not be playing football,
but you'll walk.

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.380
Here's my card. Number's right there.

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.166
You can call me anytime day or night,
24 hours a day. All right?

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:58.483
Now, I'm gonna walk back
over there to my family.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.500
I want you to watch me

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.380
and as you watch,
I want you to know that

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:07.164
one day you will walk, too.

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:10.322
(CHUCKLING)

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.282
You'll probably do it better than I do.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.420
You met someone who understands.

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.045
Give me a call, all right?

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.129
Thank you. Thank you.

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.766
Thank you so much.

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.810
Hey, it's not about me.

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:34.087
DON: Before I died on that bridge,
I was unsure of what my purpose was.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.684
Now I see it more clearly.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.731
Ministering and sharing
the hope I found.

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.929
PIPER: Over 25 years ago,

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.609
that big truck took my
life on that old bridge.

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:19.005
I am not the man I used to be.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.643
I have been beaten up,

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.685
but I'm not beaten.

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.888
I have chosen to be not bitter,

01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:33.820
but better.

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.003
And it is a choice.

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:42.660
Every day of my life,
I still ask the same question

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:47.288
that I asked in that bed,
that hospital bed, every day.

01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.565
"Oh, Lord, why?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.881
"Why did you let me see heaven
and take it away from me?"

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:05.900
I believe it is so that
I could be here with you today

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.526
and tell you to your face,

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.810
God still answers prayer.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:18.409
God is still in
the miracle business today.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:23.729
God is able to help
us find a new normal,

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:28.888
and overcome tragedy and loss,
pain and suffering.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:34.443
And God is building us a better place.

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:38.408
Heaven is real.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:43.721
I may not meet you here,

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:45.928
this side of heaven.

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:53.060
So, my prayer for you today is,
if I don't meet you here,

01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:57.484
one day I want to see you there

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.246
at the gates.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:09.167
And may God help us
to be found faithful until that day.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.003
(APPLAUSE)

01:58:13.305 --> 01:58:19.740
