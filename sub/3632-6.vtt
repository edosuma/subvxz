Previously on "Bitten"...

00:06.224 --> 00:08.157
You can change right now

00:08.160 --> 00:10.427
or you can be responsible
for this lady's death.

00:12.131 --> 00:14.597
Clara Sullivan was one
of our brightest witches.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.033
She always had a dark side.

00:16.035 --> 00:17.734
What have you gotten us into?

00:17.736 --> 00:20.037
You got us into it. He's
out there, isn't he?

00:20.039 --> 00:22.239
He's about to kill you. The prophecy.

00:22.241 --> 00:25.375
Aleister is going to cast
a spell to kill all witches.

00:25.377 --> 00:27.577
He wants to inject my blood into you.

00:27.579 --> 00:29.546
Ding-dong, the witch is dead.

00:29.548 --> 00:31.714
Savannah, can I talk
to Ruth through you?

00:31.716 --> 00:33.750
This is Elena.
We're somewhere in Quebec.

00:33.752 --> 00:36.018
I think it's some type
of former military base.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.353
No! I'm going to need you

00:37.355 --> 00:38.855
to do whatever possible

00:38.857 --> 00:40.389
to help us identify that compound.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.459
When were you going
to tell Paige the truth?

00:42.461 --> 00:43.826
That Aleister is your son?

00:43.828 --> 00:45.627
Let me go!

00:45.629 --> 00:47.196
Let your fear go. Send it out to her.

00:48.532 --> 00:50.799
You are all-powerful.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.901
Today, you are a full witch.

01:37.179 --> 01:40.347
Ruth? What are you doing here?

01:40.349 --> 01:42.617
I was on my way back to Boston.

01:42.619 --> 01:44.418
You're the only Coven
member within 50 miles.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.020
I didn't know where else to go.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.256
I need your help. My water broke.

01:49.258 --> 01:51.191
Get inside.

01:54.429 --> 01:57.664
Three minutes.

01:57.666 --> 01:58.999
Breathe, Ruth!

01:59.001 --> 02:00.667
Focus on that and breathe.

02:02.204 --> 02:04.538
Do you remember the ataraxia spell?

02:04.540 --> 02:06.239
Use it.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.347
Clara?

02:18.252 --> 02:20.253
Push, Ruth! Push!

02:24.258 --> 02:25.991
Keep pushing! Keep pushing! Keep pushing!

02:25.993 --> 02:29.328
You can do it, okay? Okay...

02:32.333 --> 02:33.966
Why won't you show her to me?

02:33.968 --> 02:37.803
Ruth, there's a problem with the baby.

02:37.805 --> 02:39.905
What?

02:48.381 --> 02:49.848
It's a boy.

02:49.850 --> 02:51.349
No, that's impossible.

02:54.854 --> 02:56.754
Oh, this is rich.

02:56.756 --> 02:59.657
Ruth Winterbourne, next
in line for Coven leader,

02:59.659 --> 03:01.560
gives birth to a male child.

03:03.862 --> 03:05.530
You're going to fix this.

03:05.532 --> 03:06.864
You're going to get rid of it.

03:06.866 --> 03:10.535
Think again. This is your problem, Ruth.

03:12.973 --> 03:15.539
How many spells have you sold?
You wouldn't.

03:15.541 --> 03:17.575
The Coven will crush your talisman.

03:17.577 --> 03:19.744
You'll be stripped of everything.

03:19.746 --> 03:22.213
You're going to tell the Coven
that it was a stillborn.

03:22.215 --> 03:23.982
But first...

03:23.984 --> 03:26.317
you're going to get rid of my mistake.

03:31.757 --> 03:34.325
What do you want me to do?

03:35.760 --> 03:38.162
You know what you have to do.

05:06.467 --> 05:07.733
Logan?

05:10.370 --> 05:11.703
Logan.

05:11.705 --> 05:13.272
Where am I?

05:13.274 --> 05:15.040
You all right?

05:15.042 --> 05:17.076
They injected me with someone's blood.

05:17.078 --> 05:18.844
Did they inject you with Elena's blood?

05:18.846 --> 05:20.912
Would that turn me into a wolf?

05:20.914 --> 05:22.982
I saw her, Logan!

05:22.984 --> 05:25.017
He forced me to watch Elena.

05:25.019 --> 05:26.585
She became a wolf!

05:26.587 --> 05:29.287
I could've run but I came back
for you, so just be honest!

05:31.223 --> 05:33.725
You're one of them, aren't you.

05:33.727 --> 05:36.194
Baby, listen. I don't know what
kind of drugs they gave you...

05:36.196 --> 05:39.197
Don't lie. I deserve better.
I deserve the truth.

05:39.199 --> 05:41.700
I deserved it from the beginning.
Two years we were together!

05:41.702 --> 05:44.402
Two years that I loved you,

05:44.404 --> 05:47.505
and it's two years
that you loved me back.

05:51.676 --> 05:53.711
And the baby?

05:53.713 --> 05:55.513
What am I pregnant with?

05:57.082 --> 05:59.583
Listen, our child will
have plenty of years

05:59.585 --> 06:03.120
- of being normal before...
- Normal?

06:03.122 --> 06:04.622
And then what?

06:04.624 --> 06:08.492
And then he becomes like his father.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.694
A werewolf.

06:10.696 --> 06:12.462
Why didn't you tell me?

06:12.464 --> 06:14.097
How am I going to explain that to you

06:14.099 --> 06:15.699
without you thinking I'm insane?

06:15.701 --> 06:19.369
How do I tell anybody that?
What would you have me do?

06:20.805 --> 06:24.174
We're going to get out of here.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.475
And when we do,

06:25.477 --> 06:28.145
I want you to walk away from me.

06:39.389 --> 06:42.158
- One more try.
- I can't.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.060
Picture your hand on top.

06:44.062 --> 06:45.728
Feel the cool metal on your palm.

06:47.531 --> 06:49.331
Close your eyes.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.435
Ugh.

06:58.641 --> 07:00.742
Oh, I can't, I'm sorry.

07:07.850 --> 07:09.317
This is a great and ancient power

07:09.319 --> 07:11.086
you and I possess.

07:11.088 --> 07:13.989
Without the talisman, I
can't connect to the Coven.

07:13.991 --> 07:16.224
For the longest time,
I didn't have one either.

07:16.226 --> 07:19.260
I survived. So will you.

07:19.262 --> 07:21.463
It's another way for your
Coven to control you.

07:23.432 --> 07:24.799
They love me.

07:27.035 --> 07:28.869
Elena even said so.

07:32.274 --> 07:33.841
I am the lock.

07:33.843 --> 07:35.477
And I am the key.

07:37.314 --> 07:39.080
Good.

07:39.082 --> 07:41.148
Then why are you distracted?

07:41.150 --> 07:43.283
Is Elena okay?

07:43.285 --> 07:44.986
What makes you think she isn't?

07:44.988 --> 07:48.355
I can just... feel her.
Something's not right.

07:48.357 --> 07:52.192
I don't want anything
bad to happen to her.

07:52.194 --> 07:55.129
Elena has no influence on you.

07:55.131 --> 07:58.165
You will forget what she said.
She is no longer in your mind.

07:59.601 --> 08:01.401
They want to control me.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.418
If you tear your bed apart,

08:19.420 --> 08:22.221
you'll just have to sleep on the floor.

08:22.223 --> 08:24.223
What do you care?

08:24.225 --> 08:26.026
I don't.

08:26.028 --> 08:27.994
But Savannah is a sensitive girl.

08:29.329 --> 08:32.298
And for some reason she's
grown attached to you.

08:32.299 --> 08:34.267
She can feel you from
across the compound

08:34.269 --> 08:37.470
and I need her to concentrate.

08:37.472 --> 08:38.770
For what?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.775
The Undoing.

08:42.777 --> 08:44.544
I want her to be calm

08:44.546 --> 08:47.245
which requires you to be calm.

08:47.247 --> 08:50.749
You're losing control.

08:50.751 --> 08:52.384
If she can sense me,

08:52.386 --> 08:55.154
then she knows that I won't
let you go through with it.

09:10.604 --> 09:13.705
You werewolves are such an...

09:13.707 --> 09:15.574
interesting species.

09:18.011 --> 09:20.344
I wish I could spend
more time figuring out

09:20.346 --> 09:23.547
which spells work on you
and which don't.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.055
The most powerful werewolf...

09:32.390 --> 09:34.658
I'm not the most powerful.

09:34.660 --> 09:38.028
I didn't know how powerful I
 was until someone showed me.

09:38.030 --> 09:41.365
The only male witch.

09:41.367 --> 09:45.135
The only female werewolf.

09:45.137 --> 09:47.705
We have so much in common.

09:47.707 --> 09:50.241
We have nothing in common.

09:56.313 --> 10:00.050
I wonder what it would
take to break you?

10:00.052 --> 10:03.820
Maybe you need to break yourself.

10:06.225 --> 10:08.591
Novem tibi orbibus.

10:15.466 --> 10:17.267
It will all soon be over.

10:25.408 --> 10:27.143
Enjoy your day.

11:07.049 --> 11:10.584
There are 3,000 acres of
forest and 10 access roads.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.054
Even as a wolf I couldn't
search all this in time.

11:14.056 --> 11:16.256
We can find some locals.
Maybe they know where it is.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.891
The nearest town is 20 miles away.

11:17.893 --> 11:20.194
We're running out
of time, I can feel it.

11:20.196 --> 11:22.496
Savannah's passed into womanhood, it's
like static electricity in the air.

11:22.498 --> 11:24.465
Can you follow it to her?

11:24.467 --> 11:26.266
That would be like
chasing a thunderstorm.

12:17.752 --> 12:19.352
Not again.

12:19.354 --> 12:21.887
Something's happening. There's
going to be another ritual.

12:23.556 --> 12:26.358
There's got to be some kind
of way to get out of here.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.194
What if we're the ritual?

12:29.196 --> 12:31.630
- Wh... Like what?
- All the tests they've been doing on me.

12:31.632 --> 12:33.965
They don't care about me,
it's the baby they're after!

12:33.967 --> 12:35.667
Logan, what if they want to take him?

12:35.669 --> 12:37.568
Hey. Look at me. That's not
going to happen, all right?

12:37.570 --> 12:39.304
I'm not joking, I'm losing my mind.

12:39.306 --> 12:41.273
I don't want to die down here.

12:41.275 --> 12:44.175
What's that?

12:44.177 --> 12:45.977
Guess I clipped a wire.

12:45.979 --> 12:47.512
Sh...

12:47.514 --> 12:49.547
Oh, god...

15:27.966 --> 15:30.006
You witches with your talk
of communing with nature,

15:30.008 --> 15:31.978
you don't know enough not to
wear heels in the forest.

15:32.002 --> 15:33.334
It's not like I had time

15:33.336 --> 15:34.736
to stop at a shoe store.

15:35.905 --> 15:37.439
We have worse to face too, you know,

15:37.441 --> 15:39.274
like whether or not
we're all going to die.

15:39.276 --> 15:40.943
You're not going to slow me down.

15:40.945 --> 15:42.310
I'm not stopping.

15:42.312 --> 15:43.845
I'm going to find Elena.

15:43.847 --> 15:45.680
Don't be such a meathead.
You need me with you.

15:45.682 --> 15:47.748
Elena will signal. That is all I need.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.150
What if she can't signal us?

15:49.152 --> 15:50.651
She will!

15:50.653 --> 15:52.087
You know, your confidence
in her is really sweet,

15:52.089 --> 15:53.654
but still. What if.

15:56.325 --> 15:58.393
Anyone who uses magic,
if we're close enough,

15:58.395 --> 16:01.261
I can spot them with this.

16:01.263 --> 16:03.297
You need me with you.

16:05.934 --> 16:08.636
Keep up or I drag you by the hair.

16:08.638 --> 16:10.404
I can't breathe.

16:10.406 --> 16:11.939
Stay close to
the holes in the door.

16:20.749 --> 16:22.282
Your bra. Take it off!

16:22.284 --> 16:23.450
You kidding me?

16:23.452 --> 16:24.918
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.220
I need the wire! The wire
in your bra, give it to me.

16:26.222 --> 16:27.554
We're going to get out of here.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.670
Elena.

16:45.006 --> 16:47.674
I'm here, darling. You're safe.

16:47.676 --> 16:49.509
Clay, how did you find me?

16:49.511 --> 16:51.477
There's no place in
this world you can go

16:51.479 --> 16:52.878
where I won't find you.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.849
Where are the others? Jeremy?

16:56.851 --> 16:59.218
It's just us.

16:59.220 --> 17:00.553
You and me.

17:00.555 --> 17:03.189
The way it's supposed to be.

17:03.191 --> 17:04.490
I have to go...

17:04.492 --> 17:06.159
No, no.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.993
The first time I saw you...

17:11.665 --> 17:14.165
I knew every part of me belonged to you.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.304
Clay...

17:19.306 --> 17:22.808
I bit you so you could have it all.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.304
Come on...

18:37.014 --> 18:38.214
Can you walk?

18:38.216 --> 18:40.383
- I can run.
- All right.

18:43.454 --> 18:44.621
Did you see anything?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.055
Maybe. I saw a glint in the east,

18:46.057 --> 18:47.322
deeper into the forest.

18:47.324 --> 18:48.724
But it was quick and then it was gone.

18:48.726 --> 18:49.925
Was it magic?

18:49.927 --> 18:51.193
Oh, it was something.

18:51.195 --> 18:52.361
Tell me exactly where.

18:52.363 --> 18:53.629
Why, what are you going to do?

18:53.631 --> 18:54.864
Run around like a bloodhound

18:54.866 --> 18:56.298
sniffing for who-knows-what?

18:56.300 --> 18:57.733
I don't think your attitude's very cute.

18:57.735 --> 18:59.568
Save it for Nick.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.471
I'm saying that we can make
it there in 20 minutes.

19:02.473 --> 19:04.839
I saw power lines,
which means an access road.

19:04.841 --> 19:06.341
I can find it on the map.

19:20.489 --> 19:21.790
What do you think?

19:24.093 --> 19:26.294
I've never had...

19:26.296 --> 19:28.096
anything...

19:28.098 --> 19:29.430
like this before.

19:30.332 --> 19:31.766
Well, isn't it time?

19:32.868 --> 19:34.602
Everything is ready.

19:35.771 --> 19:36.937
Everyone is here

19:36.939 --> 19:39.239
to celebrate you, Savannah.

19:39.241 --> 19:40.941
Today,

19:40.943 --> 19:42.743
you can use your powers.

19:42.745 --> 19:46.146
Today is the day of the Undoing.

19:46.148 --> 19:48.683
I wish Elena could see it.

20:02.898 --> 20:04.164
Savannah!

20:32.060 --> 20:33.326
Diane?

20:40.167 --> 20:41.800
My brother,

20:41.802 --> 20:44.102
he's dead because of you!

20:45.338 --> 20:48.273
And now so am I.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.114
I am coming for you.

21:27.312 --> 21:29.514
You...

21:29.516 --> 21:32.616
did this, Elena.

21:32.618 --> 21:34.484
And you will pay!

21:38.322 --> 21:40.690
You did this, Elena!

21:40.692 --> 21:43.727
And you will pay!

21:43.729 --> 21:46.530
You will pay!

21:46.532 --> 21:47.798
You will pay.

21:49.066 --> 21:52.235
You... will... pay!

22:26.535 --> 22:28.001
Over here.

22:43.385 --> 22:44.617
Ahh!

22:54.729 --> 22:55.963
Ah!

23:13.314 --> 23:15.181
Savannah?

23:15.183 --> 23:16.648
Elena, are you okay?

23:17.584 --> 23:19.318
How do I know you're real?

23:19.320 --> 23:21.453
What do you mean?

23:21.455 --> 23:24.957
Okay, of course I'm... real.

23:24.959 --> 23:26.325
I felt you were in trouble.

23:26.327 --> 23:27.860
I got away from Aleister.

23:27.862 --> 23:29.795
He did something to me.

23:31.898 --> 23:34.099
Messing with my mind.

23:34.101 --> 23:35.734
I know.

23:35.736 --> 23:38.203
We need to get out of here.

23:38.205 --> 23:40.472
Follow me, I... I know the way.

23:53.819 --> 23:55.686
Jeremy said they found
the other military base

23:55.688 --> 23:57.555
200 miles away. There's nothing there.

23:57.557 --> 24:00.125
Buildings have been knocked
to the ground years ago.

24:00.127 --> 24:01.592
It's quiet.

24:02.861 --> 24:04.662
It's got to be somewhere around here.

24:04.664 --> 24:07.698
Hidden military bases aren't
supposed to be easy to find.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.300
If I could, I would,

24:09.302 --> 24:11.669
but I can't fly around looking
for red roofs and lavender.

24:11.671 --> 24:13.638
What type of signal
are we looking for, anyway?

24:13.640 --> 24:15.172
Whatever it is, it better be big.

24:18.610 --> 24:20.510
I can't take the waiting.

24:20.512 --> 24:22.612
You really do love her, don't you.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.318
More than you can imagine.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.188
When I was a little girl,
I was taught how to be alone.

24:31.190 --> 24:33.523
How to stay alone,
how to be happy alone.

24:33.525 --> 24:34.992
I thought that way, once.

24:36.194 --> 24:37.994
Not anymore.

24:37.996 --> 24:39.996
There was a boy, when I was 13.

24:39.998 --> 24:41.431
He lived on my street.

24:41.433 --> 24:42.866
His name was Jeff.

24:44.836 --> 24:47.971
Is there a more boring
name than that? "Jeff"?

24:49.340 --> 24:51.240
He was quiet.

24:51.242 --> 24:53.776
Shy.

24:53.778 --> 24:55.811
Never really said a word to me.

24:55.813 --> 24:57.213
And then one day

24:57.215 --> 24:58.814
I found this ribbon
for my hair in the mailbox.

24:58.816 --> 25:01.584
And then another one,
and then one every single week.

25:02.886 --> 25:04.920
They were beautiful ribbons.

25:04.922 --> 25:06.990
And I'd wear them and
I'd walk down the street

25:06.992 --> 25:11.760
and I would see Jeff
and he'd be smiling at me.

25:11.762 --> 25:13.395
And then I felt like I was going crazy

25:13.397 --> 25:15.631
'cause all I could
think about was the...

25:15.633 --> 25:16.999
boring kid.

25:17.001 --> 25:18.734
On the boring street.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.740
And then I got this.

25:26.209 --> 25:27.876
Became a witch.

25:29.145 --> 25:30.612
Didn't have any more time for boys

25:30.614 --> 25:32.714
who wanted to buy me
ribbons for my hair.

25:34.517 --> 25:36.718
I made a choice.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.420
When it happens,

25:38.422 --> 25:40.955
you don't get a choice.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.724
You never want to be alone again.

25:44.259 --> 25:45.693
I have my mother.

25:45.695 --> 25:47.328
My Coven.

25:47.330 --> 25:48.763
I am not alone.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.034
Let's get going, Romeo.

25:57.940 --> 25:59.240
We will find her.

26:05.347 --> 26:06.980
Why are we here?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.282
What are you doing?

26:10.785 --> 26:12.753
This isn't the way out of here.

26:14.122 --> 26:16.222
You need to see something.

26:38.380 --> 26:42.282
No... No...

26:42.284 --> 26:44.350
That's not possible.

26:44.352 --> 26:46.286
That's not possible.

26:48.722 --> 26:50.856
Nothing's real.

26:50.858 --> 26:54.026
You're still in your cell.

26:55.997 --> 26:57.930
Hallucinating.

26:57.932 --> 27:01.100
You can't signal your friends.

27:01.102 --> 27:02.902
I know I'm real.

27:02.904 --> 27:04.303
You lied to me.

27:04.305 --> 27:06.972
You were never going to help me.

27:06.974 --> 27:08.574
You just wanted to get out.

27:08.576 --> 27:09.774
No...

27:09.776 --> 27:13.212
You only care about yourself, Elena.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.214
Can't escape your own mind.

27:17.617 --> 27:19.151
Selfish!

27:19.153 --> 27:21.786
They're all going to die because of you.

27:21.788 --> 27:23.722
For you.

27:23.724 --> 27:25.156
Please...

27:25.158 --> 27:26.591
Stop...

27:26.593 --> 27:27.726
Ah...

27:27.728 --> 27:29.628
You are a monster!

27:29.630 --> 27:33.131
And you deserve to suffer for it!

27:34.734 --> 27:37.502
You are going to stay here...

27:40.372 --> 27:42.006
forever.

28:15.565 --> 28:17.800
Wait. They're heading out to the field.

28:17.802 --> 28:19.101
We have to go through the woods.

28:19.103 --> 28:20.502
Oh, no no no, we're not going to get far

28:20.504 --> 28:22.504
if these things start heating up again.

28:22.506 --> 28:23.839
We can disable them.

28:23.841 --> 28:25.273
The entire invisible perimeter.

28:25.275 --> 28:26.875
We have to get to Aleister's quarters.

28:26.877 --> 28:28.510
It's on the other side of the compound.

28:28.512 --> 28:29.811
Let's go.

28:39.154 --> 28:41.590
Elena. All we
have to do is walk away

28:41.592 --> 28:43.191
and everything will be all right.

28:45.428 --> 28:47.428
What's down there?

28:47.430 --> 28:49.530
Peace.

28:49.532 --> 28:51.365
The peace you're looking for.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.110
I failed Savannah.

29:04.546 --> 29:06.447
I promised I'd protect her.

29:07.382 --> 29:08.682
Come with me.

29:11.353 --> 29:13.487
It's for your own good.

29:13.489 --> 29:15.422
You can let it all go.

29:15.424 --> 29:16.657
No.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.160
I don't want to let it go.

29:22.196 --> 29:24.197
That's not what I want.

29:24.199 --> 29:25.866
Then what do you want?

29:30.304 --> 29:31.537
Love.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.708
Love?

29:35.710 --> 29:38.210
In the end, it's all that matters.

29:39.813 --> 29:42.214
It is the key.

29:47.421 --> 29:49.422
We're not monsters.

29:51.057 --> 29:54.493
Because we...

29:54.495 --> 29:56.796
we can love?

29:56.798 --> 29:58.330
You're on your way back, now.

30:02.602 --> 30:04.736
You're going to need those, darling.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.507
Get outside. Signal me.

30:27.460 --> 30:30.528
...the one true path.

30:30.530 --> 30:35.066
He is the light that will
guide us to the Undoing.

30:35.068 --> 30:37.936
He is the one true path.

30:37.938 --> 30:42.072
He is the light that will
guide us to the Undoing.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.379
Bow before the two who shall remain.

30:52.917 --> 30:54.719
Gather the power.

31:37.427 --> 31:39.028
...the Undoing.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.197
He is the one true path.

31:41.199 --> 31:44.767
He is the light that will
guide us to the Undoing.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.769
He is the one true path.

31:46.771 --> 31:50.406
He is the light that will
guide us to the Undoing...

31:50.408 --> 31:52.274
Stop!

31:55.177 --> 31:56.645
Give me the girl!

31:56.647 --> 31:57.979
Elena.

31:57.981 --> 31:59.648
I want Savannah.

31:59.650 --> 32:00.883
Now!

32:11.661 --> 32:13.261
Okay, that did not sound like a ritual.

32:13.263 --> 32:16.298
I don't care. Let's just get out of here.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.800
There. That's what powers these marks.

32:18.802 --> 32:20.235
Ah!

32:23.071 --> 32:25.573
You know, you could've warned me.

32:25.575 --> 32:28.509
Rachel... I love you.

32:28.511 --> 32:31.078
All right? And I'm sorry, I didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.580
You came back for me.

32:32.582 --> 32:34.582
It counts for something.

32:39.354 --> 32:40.720
Let's just get out of here.

32:42.457 --> 32:43.723
Aleister!

33:00.908 --> 33:02.776
Find Elena and Savannah.

33:02.778 --> 33:04.177
I'll take care of this.

33:14.488 --> 33:17.056
Savannah.

33:17.058 --> 33:19.459
We have to go.

33:19.461 --> 33:21.227
Sorry, Elena.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.264
I tried to resist.

33:26.867 --> 33:29.434
But he's too strong.

33:29.436 --> 33:31.336
He didn't do the spell.

33:31.338 --> 33:35.508
He didn't kill all of the witches.
We can go.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.909
Oh...

33:38.812 --> 33:41.480
I can't.

33:41.482 --> 33:44.449
I have to stay.

33:44.451 --> 33:47.619
They don't love me.

33:47.621 --> 33:49.821
They want to control me.

33:49.823 --> 33:53.725
You don't have to do anything.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.560
Okay? Just...

33:55.562 --> 33:58.263
Come with me. We'll get out of here.
Okay?

33:58.265 --> 34:01.432
Savannah, you know
you aren't going anywhere.

34:03.702 --> 34:05.069
Fight to the end.

34:05.071 --> 34:06.905
I'm impressed.

34:06.907 --> 34:09.607
I wish I could've spent
more time with you.

34:11.409 --> 34:14.078
I have everything I need from you.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.612
I don't understand

34:15.614 --> 34:18.315
why you would care so
much about these witches.

34:18.317 --> 34:20.650
Not long ago, you didn't
even know they existed.

34:20.652 --> 34:22.920
I'm not leaving here without her.

34:22.922 --> 34:24.487
That's too bad.

34:24.489 --> 34:26.290
This is how it ends for you.

34:51.614 --> 34:52.815
Paige!

34:52.817 --> 34:55.117
Let Savannah go!

34:55.119 --> 34:57.085
Paige.

34:57.088 --> 34:58.820
I'm glad it's you.

34:58.822 --> 35:01.090
We never got the chance
to know each other.

35:01.092 --> 35:02.524
I don't want to know you.

35:02.526 --> 35:05.327
That's no way to talk
to your big brother.

35:11.434 --> 35:13.134
No.

35:13.136 --> 35:14.535
It's not possible.

35:14.537 --> 35:16.838
Ruth Winterbourne had a son.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.740
Me.

35:18.742 --> 35:19.975
You're lying.

35:19.977 --> 35:21.643
She didn't want me.

35:21.645 --> 35:24.112
But now she'll know the pain of
losing the child she did want.

35:24.114 --> 35:25.480
Ah-ah-ah, careful.

35:25.482 --> 35:28.216
You come at me, she might get hurt.

35:28.218 --> 35:29.417
Oh...

35:29.419 --> 35:30.585
Savannah.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.988
He doesn't have any power over you.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.257
No one can control you.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.827
Show them who you trust, Savannah.

35:39.829 --> 35:41.329
I am the lock.

35:42.764 --> 35:45.532
Savannah. I am the lock.

35:48.603 --> 35:50.337
I am your friend.

36:17.457 --> 36:18.856
Paige!

36:21.893 --> 36:23.995
It's okay, Savannah.

36:23.997 --> 36:25.163
We have you.

36:25.165 --> 36:27.865
Where did you send Aleister?

36:27.867 --> 36:29.166
I'm not sure.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.060
Imago.

36:57.062 --> 36:58.495
I am the lock...

37:19.082 --> 37:20.516
That thing is over!

37:20.518 --> 37:22.618
Not until we're miles
away from here. Get in.

37:24.254 --> 37:26.088
Logan! This time,

37:26.090 --> 37:28.391
you're going to do what I say. Get in!

38:08.396 --> 38:09.831
Where's Elena?

38:09.833 --> 38:12.666
She's okay. She's taking
Savannah to the car.

38:19.041 --> 38:20.507
Did you do this?

38:22.944 --> 38:25.946
I guess I did.

38:25.948 --> 38:27.281
He's dead.

38:30.518 --> 38:31.719
It's finally over.

38:31.721 --> 38:34.388
I need to find Elena.

38:34.390 --> 38:36.123
Clay!

38:39.927 --> 38:41.361
The symbol's gone.

38:43.998 --> 38:45.132
Where am I?

38:45.134 --> 38:46.366
Do you remember anything?

38:46.368 --> 38:50.137
I was feeding pigeons in Sheridan Park,

38:50.139 --> 38:51.972
talking to a man...

38:51.974 --> 38:53.306
What city?

38:53.308 --> 38:55.742
This isn't Albany?

38:55.744 --> 38:58.578
What's happening?

38:58.580 --> 39:00.346
Oh my God.

39:00.348 --> 39:01.981
Who are you people?

39:01.983 --> 39:03.383
What happened?

39:03.385 --> 39:05.752
Dormi.

39:05.754 --> 39:07.953
We're going to have problems
when they all wake up.

39:07.955 --> 39:09.188
I can keep them sleeping.

39:09.190 --> 39:10.823
But it would be better
if they could wake up

39:10.825 --> 39:12.591
somewhere other than here.

39:12.593 --> 39:14.459
Okay, the last thing we need is an
investigation into what happened here.

39:14.461 --> 39:16.095
Jeremy and Nick will arrive in an hour.

39:16.097 --> 39:18.197
They'll figure out how to
get these people far away.

39:18.199 --> 39:20.132
Just as long as they don't remember
any of this. No, they won't.

39:20.134 --> 39:21.700
I'll watch out for them!

39:24.637 --> 39:25.871
Dormi.

39:40.720 --> 39:41.986
You okay?

39:41.988 --> 39:43.388
Yeah.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.502
You kept your promise.

39:58.504 --> 40:01.306
I don't like letting my friends down.

40:01.308 --> 40:03.040
Elena, can we stay friends?

40:03.042 --> 40:06.043
I don't mean texting each
other every now and then.

40:06.045 --> 40:07.911
I mean...

40:07.913 --> 40:10.848
We actually can get to see each other.

40:10.850 --> 40:12.115
I'd like that.

40:21.192 --> 40:23.026
Elena!

40:23.028 --> 40:24.361
Oh, you're safe...

40:31.102 --> 40:33.370
You made it.

40:33.372 --> 40:35.104
Nothing would've stopped me.

40:37.140 --> 40:40.977
Get me as far away
from here as possible.

40:40.979 --> 40:43.380
I'll get you home, how about that.

40:49.219 --> 40:51.287
Did they hurt you?

40:53.257 --> 40:54.924
I saw things, Clay.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.594
I almost lost my mind.

41:00.430 --> 41:02.131
I'll be here for you.

41:04.467 --> 41:06.335
You always were.

41:33.496 --> 41:35.463
There's no sign
of Rachel and Logan.

41:35.465 --> 41:36.831
They must've escaped.

41:36.833 --> 41:38.599
Then we're all safe.
