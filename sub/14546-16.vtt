<i>(Tessa) George didn't love shrinks.</i>

00:02.190 --> 00:04.990
<i>But he also knew when
he was in over his head,</i>

00:05.110 --> 00:06.257
<i>and such was the case</i>

00:06.249 --> 00:08.540
<i>when Noah announced his undying love for...</i>

00:08.571 --> 00:10.323
Carmen.

00:10.683 --> 00:12.458
Great.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.928
And...

00:14.048 --> 00:16.634
Uh, C... Carmen wrestling a snake.

00:17.424 --> 00:18.941
Mm-hmm.

00:19.349 --> 00:21.248
All right.

00:21.368 --> 00:23.569
Carmen as a butterfly...

00:23.603 --> 00:27.051
making love... to a dragon's face.

00:30.977 --> 00:33.019
Al Jarreau.

00:33.738 --> 00:35.545
Wait, wait, wait.

00:36.049 --> 00:38.602
Al Jarreau straddling Carmen.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.487
Fantastic.

00:41.538 --> 00:44.179
Oh. Are you writing a prescription?

00:44.207 --> 00:45.941
Yes.

00:45.976 --> 00:47.401
Yes, I am.

00:47.651 --> 00:49.027
Okay.

00:49.147 --> 00:50.680
(Door opens)

00:50.714 --> 00:52.907
Hey. How... how... how is he? (Door closes)

00:52.907 --> 00:55.230
The man is obsessed, quite frankly,

00:55.276 --> 00:56.974
with Carmen, his former housekeeper.

00:56.996 --> 00:59.554
I knew it. I knew it. This is a mess.

00:59.674 --> 01:00.719
He thinks he's in love with her.

01:00.719 --> 01:03.386
But he's not. It's a midlife crisis,

01:03.506 --> 01:07.100
and it is incredibly
common, and it will pass.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.593
Okay. You sure?

01:08.713 --> 01:11.252
- It's classic caregiver transference.
- Uh-huh.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.379
Triggered, perhaps,

01:12.386 --> 01:14.975
by being married to an icy, strident,

01:14.983 --> 01:17.321
self-important, castrating W.A.S.P.

01:17.321 --> 01:18.979
So you've met Jill?

01:18.987 --> 01:20.809
I've met everyone.

01:20.816 --> 01:23.561
Right. Well, there... there's
gotta be something I can do.

01:23.561 --> 01:27.072
Well, there is. Keep his mind off of Carmen

01:27.104 --> 01:29.207
- and redirect those thoughts.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29.262 --> 01:31.530
Introduce some fun new hobbies,

01:31.522 --> 01:33.086
great food, perhaps.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.143
I know this fantastic place for baklava,

01:36.159 --> 01:38.317
if he partakes in something like that.

01:38.724 --> 01:44.370
You may also want to employ
a little light smack talk.

01:44.378 --> 01:47.975
Offer up some disparaging
remarks about Carmen.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.344
Hmm. Will that work?

01:49.344 --> 01:50.536
It may.

01:50.570 --> 01:53.172
For example, um...

01:53.206 --> 01:55.507
"Carmen isn't even that pretty."

01:55.627 --> 02:00.446
Or, "if you ask me,
Carmen isn't too pretty."

02:00.974 --> 02:03.664
Or, "there are a lot of
other girls out there"...

02:03.672 --> 02:05.503
Aah! (Thuds)

02:05.535 --> 02:08.101
<i>(Noah yelling indistinctly, punches landing)
Passion, when expressed non-violently,</i>

02:08.115 --> 02:10.054
<i>- can be beautiful.
- Noah!</i>

02:10.054 --> 02:12.072
<i>But just because you're
passionate about something,</i>

02:12.401 --> 02:15.545
<i>doesn't necessarily mean that
others share your passion.</i>

02:15.795 --> 02:20.174
Oh, Tessa, just look how the
sunlight kisses each crystal

02:20.214 --> 02:22.882
and sends all those
refractions just flyin'.

02:23.002 --> 02:26.595
(Gasps) Oh, isn't it
just a thing of wonder?

02:26.994 --> 02:29.637
Tessa, do you or do you not

02:29.668 --> 02:32.429
feel like you're doing
the rumba inside a rainbow?

02:33.071 --> 02:36.374
Oh. Yeah. Totally.

02:36.392 --> 02:38.201
Sorry, Dallas. (Slaps table)

02:38.209 --> 02:40.844
I'm just really stressed
about this whole college thing.

02:40.883 --> 02:42.526
I mean, watching Ryan go through it,

02:42.533 --> 02:44.817
I can't stop thinking about next year.

02:44.801 --> 02:48.407
My grades are fine, but I'm
not sure that's enough anymore.

02:48.884 --> 02:50.221
I need to be more impressive.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.841
Impressive? Tessa, you're very impressive.

02:52.961 --> 02:55.187
After all, how many high school students

02:55.211 --> 02:56.454
can boast to being named

02:56.478 --> 02:59.575
senior vice president of prismatic affairs

02:59.606 --> 03:01.366
at a crystal cup of crystals?

03:01.397 --> 03:02.875
I don't think the schools I'm looking at

03:02.867 --> 03:04.158
are gonna care about that.

03:04.142 --> 03:08.193
I... I need a credential
with more substance.

03:08.201 --> 03:08.913
(Door bells jingle)

03:08.944 --> 03:12.252
Dallas, may I post a
flyer in your shop window

03:12.245 --> 03:13.253
for my book signing?

03:13.277 --> 03:16.319
As you may recall, I'm a published author.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.455
And as such, I find my readers

03:19.471 --> 03:21.903
really do relish the
opportunity for face time.

03:21.950 --> 03:22.967
Excuse me, Mrs. Werner.

03:22.998 --> 03:25.767
I'd be happy to post
flyers for you around town,

03:25.798 --> 03:28.035
or help you with anything
else you may need.

03:28.058 --> 03:30.506
- Interning for a published author...
- Which I am.

03:30.506 --> 03:32.532
Would look really good
on my college application.

03:32.563 --> 03:35.714
An intern. What a novel idea.

03:35.706 --> 03:39.108
Pun intended, constructed,
and delivered impeccably.

03:39.898 --> 03:41.243
You'll start at once.

03:41.228 --> 03:42.666
You don't mind, right, Dallas?

03:42.697 --> 03:43.698
I mean, it's been pretty slow around here.

03:43.706 --> 03:45.129
I'm sure you can manage without me.

03:45.168 --> 03:47.663
Manage? Don't be silly. A
monkey could do this job.

03:47.703 --> 03:50.440
Oh. Absolutely. That's
what I've always said.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.942
I'll just go ahead and place
an ad for part-time help...

03:52.926 --> 03:53.904
at the zoo.

03:53.896 --> 03:55.460
Sensational.

03:55.478 --> 03:57.563
Tessa, you're hired. You have the job.

03:57.587 --> 03:59.738
And I use that term loosely,
because there is no pay.

03:59.753 --> 04:02.333
- Understood.
- I'm tough, but not fair.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.074

04:13.361 --> 04:15.261
(Dalia) Mr. Wolfe?

04:15.799 --> 04:17.182
What are you doing?

04:17.216 --> 04:19.151
Oh, Dalia, don't mind me.

04:19.492 --> 04:22.472
Since Chef Alan adulterated
our relationship,

04:22.495 --> 04:25.162
I've decided to throw
out absolutely everything

04:25.139 --> 04:26.675
that reminds me of him.

04:30.246 --> 04:32.068
Which is absolutely everything.

04:32.076 --> 04:33.851
What about the microwave?

04:34.164 --> 04:35.392
<i>What about the microwave?</i>

04:35.512 --> 04:37.652
Doesn't the microwave
remind you of Chef Alan?

04:37.684 --> 04:38.497
Not really.

04:38.536 --> 04:41.391
But the microwave cooks
food, and so does Chef Alan.

04:41.511 --> 04:43.002
No, I see your point.

04:43.025 --> 04:44.605
You should throw out your microwave.

04:44.590 --> 04:46.834
Okay. I know. It's just...

04:47.609 --> 04:49.767
I use my microwave...

04:49.887 --> 04:51.206
a lot.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.794
Yeah.

04:53.302 --> 04:55.605
And besides, Mr. Wolfe,

04:55.656 --> 04:57.025
getting rid of all your stuff

04:57.040 --> 04:58.933
isn't gonna make you feel better anyway.

04:58.956 --> 05:02.147
It isn't? Well, what is?

05:13.992 --> 05:15.775

05:17.422 --> 05:18.345
- Mmm!
- You like it?

05:18.329 --> 05:19.744
I love it!

05:19.864 --> 05:21.864
Almost as much as I love...

05:21.864 --> 05:23.811
Don't say it. Come on.

05:23.827 --> 05:25.423
Don't... don't even say her name.

05:25.430 --> 05:27.472
You need to wipe every thought...

05:27.526 --> 05:29.247
She was good at wiping stuff.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.060
Noah...

05:30.068 --> 05:32.916
<i>She was. She wiped everything.</i>

05:32.916 --> 05:35.496
My counters, my windows,

05:35.616 --> 05:38.304
and you should have seen
the way she polished a knob.

05:38.424 --> 05:39.759
(Squeaking)

05:39.879 --> 05:40.815
<i>(Noah) She loved it.</i>

05:40.783 --> 05:42.363
<i>(Spits) It wasn't a chore.</i>

05:42.483 --> 05:44.131
<i>She was greedy for it.</i>

05:44.178 --> 05:45.625
Hmm.

05:45.937 --> 05:50.083
<i>She was a sorceress. A playful sorceress.</i>

05:50.203 --> 05:51.795
<i>She invented this great game</i>

05:51.787 --> 05:54.509
<i>where she would disappear into thin air.</i>

05:54.845 --> 05:57.958
<i>And the moment that Opus
and I began to get nervous,</i>

05:58.078 --> 06:00.695
<i>she would reappear! (Laughs)</i>

06:00.815 --> 06:01.610
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

06:01.633 --> 06:02.814
It was peek-a-boo.

06:02.799 --> 06:04.363
It was pure magic.

06:04.386 --> 06:06.685
I'm trying to help you here, Noah.

06:06.716 --> 06:08.523
You're a married man.

06:08.643 --> 06:10.454
My body may be married.

06:10.574 --> 06:13.247
But my soul... it runs free,

06:13.286 --> 06:15.702
<i>(Noah) through the night, into the thicket,</i>

06:16.320 --> 06:19.816
<i>where warm Carmen awaits,</i>

06:20.504 --> 06:22.545
<i>in the damp, salty night air.</i>

06:22.545 --> 06:23.257
Hey! (Snaps fingers)

06:23.304 --> 06:25.791
You need to stop indulging
this fantasy and move on.

06:25.911 --> 06:27.550
- Move on?
- Yes.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.943
Ever since Carmen left, I
haven't been able to sleep.

06:30.288 --> 06:32.048
(Crunches) I haven't been able to eat.

06:32.079 --> 06:33.283
Really? Seem... seems like

06:33.307 --> 06:35.043
you're doing just fine with the baklava.

06:35.317 --> 06:37.608
Yeah, well, this happens to be delicious.

06:38.218 --> 06:40.502
As you can see, I moved my desk in here,

06:40.510 --> 06:42.927
on the front lines. This allowed me

06:42.911 --> 06:46.298
to observe my subject in
its natural habitat. (Cooing)

06:47.470 --> 06:49.253
(Giggling) (Laughs)

06:49.373 --> 06:51.256
- Tessa, I beg you.
- Sorry.

06:51.376 --> 06:54.462
In any case, the more I studied the baby,

06:54.582 --> 06:59.264
the more I realized he has
no idea what he's doing.

06:59.310 --> 07:00.913
Babies are born into this world

07:00.913 --> 07:03.174
with their heads up their diapers.

07:03.174 --> 07:05.340
They have no idea how to be a baby.

07:05.387 --> 07:07.194
Hence...

07:07.946 --> 07:09.329
my latest book.

07:09.364 --> 07:11.692
"How to be a baby: You're out, now what?"

07:11.700 --> 07:12.841
Wow.

07:13.702 --> 07:18.069
How brave of you to target a
demographic that doesn't read.

07:18.189 --> 07:18.997
You know what?

07:19.051 --> 07:21.158
They'll never learn if
you coddle them, Tessa.

07:21.192 --> 07:22.426
Never.

07:22.460 --> 07:23.861
(Thuds, Opus coos)

07:23.981 --> 07:26.810
Now as my intern, your main duty

07:26.818 --> 07:29.438
is to nurture and support
my creative process

07:29.718 --> 07:30.765
and to count out

07:30.744 --> 07:33.671
my daily nutritional allotment of almonds.

07:33.705 --> 07:35.088
Six almonds.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.075
No more, even if I beg.

07:38.109 --> 07:41.428
You are not to give me
a single almond over six.

07:41.624 --> 07:42.679
Think I can handle that.

07:42.687 --> 07:44.548
That's only because
you've never seen me beg.

07:44.549 --> 07:46.083
Six almonds.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.107
- What if I'm starving?
- So what?

07:48.162 --> 07:49.147
Six almonds.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.595
<i>Bravissima. (Packaging rustles)</i>

07:51.861 --> 07:53.112
Oh, wait a minute.

07:53.401 --> 07:56.717
It actually says here
serving size is seven almonds.

07:56.837 --> 07:58.586
So let's make it seven almonds.

07:58.641 --> 08:01.269
"Seven almonds."

08:01.511 --> 08:02.199
Got it.

08:02.207 --> 08:04.553
Add one more almond to the pile,

08:04.850 --> 08:06.360
and we're all set.

08:06.915 --> 08:08.464
Coming right up.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.552
(Packaging rustles)

08:11.943 --> 08:13.734
(Clink)

08:14.462 --> 08:16.072
Thank you, Tessa.

08:16.192 --> 08:17.815
Aah!

08:17.849 --> 08:19.535
You imbecile.

08:19.655 --> 08:22.321
You gullible, malleable fool.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.066
I just tricked you into
giving me another almond.

08:25.186 --> 08:27.186
I tricked you!

08:27.553 --> 08:29.383
You have to be ready.

08:29.657 --> 08:31.369
- But...
- Butts are for people

08:31.369 --> 08:33.669
who eat more than six almonds in a sitting.

08:33.789 --> 08:36.288
And as you can see from my butt,

08:36.408 --> 08:37.837
that ain't me.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.953
Pun intended.

08:46.980 --> 08:50.343
<i>So that's why he's been so
upset over Carmen leaving?</i>

08:50.392 --> 08:54.340
I had no idea Noah is in love with Carmen.

08:54.347 --> 08:55.904
Okay, okay. Da... Dallas,

08:55.911 --> 08:57.687
not a... not a word to anyone.

08:57.710 --> 09:01.040
And you cannot say anything to Jill.

09:01.075 --> 09:03.122
(Sighs) I can't imagine how she'd feel.

09:03.153 --> 09:04.373
<i>Or if she'd feel.</i>

09:04.493 --> 09:05.914
Jill tends to resist feeling.

09:05.937 --> 09:07.228
For instance, she felt nothing

09:07.259 --> 09:09.566
when she stole your
daughter from my employ.

09:09.589 --> 09:10.974
Okay, well, I think... I think Tessa

09:10.942 --> 09:12.602
thought that was a good opportunity.

09:13.117 --> 09:16.186
Hey, as rewarding as the
crystal field has been for you,

09:16.605 --> 09:19.256
it's probably not where she
sees herself in five years.

09:19.303 --> 09:21.860
No? I guess she sees herself residing

09:21.852 --> 09:25.215
in the frigid, flaky recesses
of Jill Werner's tailpipe.

09:25.207 --> 09:27.483
Wow. You really paint a picture.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.360
But truthfully, that coldness, I think,

09:29.376 --> 09:30.244
is part of the problem.

09:30.283 --> 09:32.970
I mean, Carmen... she was warm with Noah.

09:33.090 --> 09:37.079
I know. She's the best. She's numero uno.

09:37.126 --> 09:38.244
Yeah, but the timing.

09:38.295 --> 09:41.114
I mean, they have a new baby.
They have to stick together.

09:41.161 --> 09:42.357
Right, and it's not exactly

09:42.366 --> 09:44.867
like Carmen's expressed the
same feelings towards him.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.377
Since she's been here,

09:46.431 --> 09:48.942
<i>she has not mentioned Noah's name once.</i>

09:48.996 --> 09:52.008
Noah? If I may ask, how is he?

09:52.128 --> 09:54.597
- Oh. Uh, he's... he's good.
- He's good.

09:54.717 --> 09:56.369
- He's doing real good.
- Real good.

09:56.489 --> 09:57.475
(Exhales)

10:01.033 --> 10:02.816
Please give this to him for me.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.430
He always forgets to wipe down
the touch screen of his phone.

10:06.550 --> 10:08.362
It tends to get so greasy.

10:09.410 --> 10:12.765
I... I will... see that he gets this.

10:12.885 --> 10:15.150
Thank you. On a lighter note,

10:15.197 --> 10:18.294
I pulled three handfuls of yellow wig hair

10:18.310 --> 10:20.672
from the drain in the downstairs bath.

10:21.477 --> 10:24.004
I'll talk to Dalia.

10:24.270 --> 10:25.810
He needs a new look,

10:25.818 --> 10:27.973
one that says, "you cheated on me,

10:27.977 --> 10:28.610
you're a cheater,

10:28.602 --> 10:30.229
drop dead, you homosexual cheater."

10:30.253 --> 10:31.535
But without losing a lot of length.

10:31.655 --> 10:34.015
How about some daring magenta tips?

10:34.135 --> 10:35.133
Ooh, like that.

10:35.253 --> 10:36.956
But do daring magenta tips say,

10:36.985 --> 10:38.719
"I hope you stop breathing in your sleep"?

10:38.770 --> 10:40.045
Mm, no. But they do say,

10:40.072 --> 10:42.022
"I'm fun. You're not.
I hope you get S.A.R.S."

10:42.057 --> 10:43.340
'Kay.

10:43.374 --> 10:44.933
This is exciting.

10:44.980 --> 10:47.111
No, Mr. Wolfe.

10:47.145 --> 10:49.447
This is war.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.972
Okay. I stuffed your face
in all these envelopes,

10:52.092 --> 10:53.568
cubed your bedtime gouda,

10:53.568 --> 10:55.859
and ordered refill bags
for the diaper genie.

10:55.979 --> 10:58.369
Is there anything else you'd like me to do

10:58.377 --> 10:59.277
before I head out?

10:59.397 --> 11:01.341
Tessa, why did you take this internship

11:01.359 --> 11:02.772
working for me? It's funny.

11:02.764 --> 11:04.876
I was actually just asking
myself the same question.

11:04.876 --> 11:06.291
I think I know the answer.

11:06.411 --> 11:07.833
I think that there's a part of you

11:07.872 --> 11:10.533
that dreams of one day
being a published author.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.931
You know, maybe you're...

11:12.931 --> 11:14.054
Of course I'm right.

11:14.088 --> 11:16.704
Which is why I'd like to give you

11:16.693 --> 11:18.288
a little creative writing assignment.

11:18.408 --> 11:19.626
Really?

11:20.290 --> 11:24.731
That's great. I mean, thank you.

11:24.765 --> 11:27.048
You are very welcome.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.821
So what's the assignment?

11:31.855 --> 11:34.298
I'd like you to help Opus

11:34.314 --> 11:36.769
write a review for my new book.

11:37.473 --> 11:38.710
(Opus fusses) Wait, what?

11:38.830 --> 11:41.157
It'll take a little
creativity on your part,

11:41.181 --> 11:43.777
and a willingness to try on his.

11:44.401 --> 11:46.336
(Coos)

11:46.370 --> 11:48.822
(Sighs) Don't think I understand.

11:48.856 --> 11:50.879
He will speak without words,

11:50.999 --> 11:53.178
and you will listen without ears.

11:53.232 --> 11:54.093
I have ears.

11:54.085 --> 11:57.150
Then you heard how... poetic that sounded.

11:57.270 --> 11:58.981
Let me get this straight...

11:59.418 --> 12:02.437
You want me to ask Opus
what he thought of your book,

12:02.469 --> 12:05.847
and then transcribe his
incoherent babbling...

12:05.863 --> 12:09.257
Into a review that you post on Amazon.

12:09.377 --> 12:10.556
If there's another printing,

12:10.579 --> 12:12.159
it may even wind up on the jacket.

12:12.495 --> 12:14.130
I'll be your first published piece,

12:14.169 --> 12:16.023
and my first five-star review.

12:15.999 --> 12:17.946
How do you know Opus is
gonna give you five stars?

12:18.066 --> 12:21.043
He connects with the
material. See for yourself.

12:21.163 --> 12:23.283
(Rips)

12:25.884 --> 12:28.355
And I just thought some fresh air

12:28.389 --> 12:30.807
and a new hobby, like tapping syrup,

12:30.841 --> 12:32.718
would help get your mind off of...

12:32.734 --> 12:33.923
Tapping Carmen?

12:33.978 --> 12:36.207
I get it. You're a good friend.

12:36.261 --> 12:38.209
Well, I'm just trying
to look out for you, man.

12:38.329 --> 12:39.933
I can tell you from experience,

12:39.967 --> 12:41.666
the single parent thing is not easy.

12:41.689 --> 12:42.925
And neither is marriage,

12:42.886 --> 12:45.572
but you can't just bolt
when things get hard.

12:45.606 --> 12:48.165
- No. You're right.
- Yeah.

12:48.180 --> 12:52.662
My place is in Jill Werner's
bony, punishing arms.

12:53.068 --> 12:55.039
Besides, if Carmen felt the same,

12:55.071 --> 12:56.377
she would have reached out by now.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.481
Some small gesture, but she hasn't.

12:59.601 --> 13:01.170
Yeah.

13:01.439 --> 13:03.790
L... let's go home.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.825
- Yeah?
- Let's take our sap,

13:05.843 --> 13:08.529
run it through the reverse osmosis filter,

13:08.537 --> 13:12.368
boil it, evaporate it, bottle it...

13:13.330 --> 13:14.331
and then go home.

13:14.378 --> 13:18.046
(Whirring, dryer turns off)

13:19.133 --> 13:23.090
(Pink) * I don't know if
I could yell any louder *

13:24.365 --> 13:26.096
My only question is,

13:26.130 --> 13:27.931
is it gay enough?

13:27.982 --> 13:29.399
Absolutely.

13:29.847 --> 13:31.634
I think it's naughty.

13:31.669 --> 13:32.669
(Giggles) It is.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.437
Thank you guys for the pick-me-up.

13:34.476 --> 13:36.239
I really needed it.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.730
(Whispers) Where do I pay?

13:37.738 --> 13:40.366
You don't pay. Chef Alan pays.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.587
Actually, he does pay.

13:43.111 --> 13:46.881
Fine. You pay, and then Chef Alan pays.

13:47.001 --> 13:48.875
This is only phase one, Mr. Wolfe.

13:48.914 --> 13:49.892
Phase one?

13:49.939 --> 13:52.300
You look better, but you don't feel better.

13:52.347 --> 13:53.747
And in order to feel better,

13:53.778 --> 13:55.650
you need to make Chef Alan feel worse.

13:55.770 --> 13:58.588
You need to find his sad
button and his mad button,

13:58.596 --> 14:00.190
and push them both...

14:00.224 --> 14:02.676
like, 15 times in a row.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.688
How do you know all this?

14:04.808 --> 14:06.550
Dalia, did someone break your...

14:06.597 --> 14:08.231
(Droning noise)

14:08.266 --> 14:09.549
What's that noise?

14:09.567 --> 14:11.195
She's crying.

14:11.485 --> 14:12.819
(Continues droning) Crying?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.763
Are you sure? There are no tears.

14:15.778 --> 14:18.859
Yeah. She taught herself
to dry cry years ago

14:18.867 --> 14:20.324
to avoid ruining her makeup.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.861
(Continues droning) It'll run its course.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.904
It often stops just as suddenly as...

14:23.865 --> 14:26.148
Do you guys wanna get Sushi?

14:33.235 --> 14:34.909
(Typing) "The only thing that stinks

14:34.948 --> 14:37.841
more than this book is my diaper.

14:38.404 --> 14:40.688
All the wipes in the world

14:40.696 --> 14:43.378
won't freshen up this turd.

14:43.498 --> 14:47.077
Signed, Opus Werner."

14:47.406 --> 14:49.399
Throwing Opus under the bus, aren't ya?

14:49.704 --> 14:52.027
Uh, I'd like to think Opus and I

14:52.043 --> 14:53.338
are of the same mind on this.

14:53.458 --> 14:57.502
Well, it sounds like somebody
has mastered how to be a baby.

14:59.544 --> 15:01.663
It's not me. It's her.

15:01.679 --> 15:04.345
Jill Werner is the most
vapid, self-obsessed narcissist

15:04.338 --> 15:05.401
I have ever met.

15:05.385 --> 15:07.247
Well, nobody's perfect.

15:07.591 --> 15:08.866
Why are we eating syrup?

15:08.986 --> 15:10.750
Well, I didn't get the Greens.
You want some on your Greens?

15:10.758 --> 15:11.658
- The Greens?
- Yeah.

15:11.689 --> 15:13.003
No, dad, I don't.

15:13.018 --> 15:14.567
We can choose to bask in the negativity

15:14.598 --> 15:16.530
because somebody had a
bad day at the office,

15:16.650 --> 15:17.859
or we can happily guzzle

15:17.883 --> 15:20.416
the sweet, Amber fluid of the lord.

15:20.752 --> 15:22.066
There. Now it's on your Greens.

15:22.105 --> 15:24.084
- George, the woman is a monster.
- Okay.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.595
I honestly don't know how
Noah stays married to her.

15:26.642 --> 15:29.732
Part of me wants to
slip him a note that says

15:29.958 --> 15:32.054
"run. Run for your life."

15:32.077 --> 15:33.086
Please do not do that,

15:33.094 --> 15:34.596
because I have been working very hard

15:34.627 --> 15:35.581
to keep that from happening.

15:35.597 --> 15:36.464
Look, I'll admit

15:36.449 --> 15:38.748
that Jill is not like most
of the moms in Chatswin.

15:38.868 --> 15:40.007
But she's a career woman.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.149
I thought you of all people
would appreciate that.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.682
I thought you looked up to her.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.959
I did, until I got to know her.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.281
Have you seen how she conducts herself

15:48.312 --> 15:49.439
around a plate of almonds?

15:49.423 --> 15:50.839
Well, she's got a lot going on.

15:50.885 --> 15:52.591
Have you ever written a body of work

15:52.711 --> 15:54.092
you were extremely proud of?

15:54.115 --> 15:55.677
I imagine it takes a lot out of you.

15:55.695 --> 15:59.527
Oh, my God. George, why
are you defending her?

16:00.075 --> 16:01.411
And then I thought,

16:01.436 --> 16:03.633
my God, George, why are you defending her?

16:03.938 --> 16:05.506
And I realized

16:05.540 --> 16:08.395
that it's impossible for me
to hear you talk about leaving

16:08.794 --> 16:13.166
without remembering what
it felt like to be left.

16:14.621 --> 16:16.250
I'm Jill.

16:16.317 --> 16:20.321
I'm an unpublished Jill
Werner, 17 years out.

16:20.673 --> 16:21.854
Grim.

16:21.870 --> 16:23.582
(Sighs) I wasn't being objective,

16:23.621 --> 16:25.389
or a good friend.

16:25.999 --> 16:28.173
I... I have no right telling you...

16:28.453 --> 16:31.021
Look, don't beat yourself up, buddy.

16:31.055 --> 16:32.529
Carmen and I weren't meant to be.

16:32.537 --> 16:34.602
Like I said, if she felt anything for me,

16:34.722 --> 16:37.010
she would have reached out by now.

16:37.044 --> 16:37.978
Yeah.

16:38.012 --> 16:41.218
Well, that's the thing.

16:43.932 --> 16:44.999
Where did you get this?

16:45.119 --> 16:47.154
From Carmen. She asked
me to give it to you,

16:47.138 --> 16:48.496
and I didn't, because...

16:48.616 --> 16:50.180
I knew it.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.658
I knew it.

16:51.692 --> 16:53.760
<i>She does care.</i>

16:53.795 --> 16:56.363
I am leaving my wife...

16:57.000 --> 16:58.846
for Carmen!

16:58.866 --> 17:01.401
(Laughs)

17:01.419 --> 17:03.937
- Whoo-hoo!
- Noah? Darling?

17:03.992 --> 17:05.321
(Door opens)

17:06.103 --> 17:10.116
Well, today's pain is
tomorrow's best-seller.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.492
Am I right?

17:17.101 --> 17:18.885
Sweets...

17:18.919 --> 17:21.737
<i>(Tessa) When your strike
reaches its intended target,</i>

17:21.729 --> 17:24.576
<i>there's something
bittersweet about the moment.</i>

17:24.695 --> 17:28.620
<i>On the one hand, it's great
to watch your tormentor fall.</i>

17:28.740 --> 17:30.677
<i>On the other hand,</i>

17:30.864 --> 17:33.820
<i>watching them fall reminds
you that they're human.</i>

17:34.047 --> 17:35.152
Jill...

17:35.908 --> 17:38.122
I'm sorry about that.

17:38.169 --> 17:40.531
I can't understand what went wrong with us.

17:41.086 --> 17:42.963
I know how painful this must be.

17:42.971 --> 17:44.723
Oh, I looked like a fool today.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.867
Meaning I... I think maybe Noah has been...

17:47.921 --> 17:49.751
Noah? I'm talking about you.

17:49.766 --> 17:51.792
I asked you to do one thing for me.

17:52.050 --> 17:55.655
Craft a five-star ok review
from my child's point of view.

17:55.687 --> 17:56.461
- And what you...
- Hold on.

17:56.581 --> 17:57.602
Are you really telling me

17:57.618 --> 17:59.964
that you're more upset about
the book review I posted

17:59.957 --> 18:03.187
than you are about...
the end of your marriage?

18:03.233 --> 18:05.861
Look, Noah leaving me for Carmen

18:05.869 --> 18:07.793
is a real crap sandwich.

18:07.913 --> 18:09.200
But you know something?

18:09.224 --> 18:11.155
It came on ciabatta.

18:11.343 --> 18:13.683
(Greg Laswell's "Girls just
want to have fun" playing)

18:13.734 --> 18:15.543
What's this? You already
started a new book?

18:15.663 --> 18:18.288
A new chapter.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.487
Ahh.

18:21.714 --> 18:23.598
Mm. (Inhales deeply)

18:23.718 --> 18:25.827
Maybe this one will be worth a damn.

18:26.031 --> 18:27.845
<i>And then it occurred to me...</i>

18:28.040 --> 18:30.199
<i>no matter what I thought of Jill Werner,</i>

18:30.401 --> 18:31.622
<i>it would never be as bad</i>

18:31.638 --> 18:33.694
<i>as what Jill Werner thought of herself.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:36.744
♪ Those girls, they... ♪

18:36.864 --> 18:38.424
Hey, Dallas.

18:38.442 --> 18:40.074
Tessa. How are you doing?

18:40.092 --> 18:42.845
Have you climbed your way
up the literary food chain

18:42.880 --> 18:44.714
and secured the college
credential of your dreams?

18:44.721 --> 18:46.474
Actually...

18:47.401 --> 18:50.403
I'd really like to come
back and work for you,

18:50.437 --> 18:52.405
if you'll have me.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.090
Well, I don't know, Tessa.

18:54.124 --> 18:56.257
No college admissions director

18:56.377 --> 18:57.844
- is gonna look twice...
- I don't care.

18:57.878 --> 19:00.418
Working for Jill might
look better on paper,

19:00.441 --> 19:05.418
but she can't teach me anything
about being a good person.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.934
And... who can, exactly?

19:08.973 --> 19:10.944
Okay, now you're just fishing.

19:11.064 --> 19:13.309
Well, go on, let me catch something.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.028
You, Dallas.

19:15.062 --> 19:18.097
I can learn about being
a better person from you.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.949
Who? (Laughs)

19:19.984 --> 19:22.819
I like the way you say that. (Laughs)

19:29.612 --> 19:31.262
Where is she?

19:31.382 --> 19:33.483
Carmen.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.444
Carmen!

19:35.564 --> 19:37.933
(Carmen, voice echoes) In the bathroom!

19:39.928 --> 19:41.851
It better be number one, woman,

19:41.891 --> 19:43.251
'cause I'm coming in.

19:43.494 --> 19:45.621
This can't wait! Ahh!

19:45.741 --> 19:49.618
(Gasps) Mr. Werner!

19:50.021 --> 19:51.768
<i>(Squeaks) (Romantic music playing)</i>

19:52.222 --> 19:53.841
Don't move a muscle, Carmen.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.422
I want to remember you just like this.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.056
It's going to cause a flood.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.341
I don't care! Let it!

20:04.078 --> 20:06.504
Why didn't you contact me?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.856
I waited every day for you to contact me,

20:08.864 --> 20:09.944
and you never did!

20:10.064 --> 20:11.805
I wrote you 42 e-mails,

20:12.039 --> 20:14.237
one e-mail a day for 42 days.

20:14.222 --> 20:15.731
What address did you use?

20:15.851 --> 20:17.929
The A.O.L. one.

20:18.049 --> 20:20.815
I don't check that account.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.193
It's too late now.

20:24.313 --> 20:26.312
It's over.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.244
It's not over.

20:28.364 --> 20:30.317
It's never over!

20:30.747 --> 20:35.249
(Music swells)

20:35.283 --> 20:37.535
(Music stops) (Grunts) What the hell?!

20:38.028 --> 20:40.788
(Squeaks) I thought you said you missed me.

20:41.030 --> 20:43.846
<i>(Spits) I miss working for you.</i>

20:44.550 --> 20:47.584
I'm sorry, but I only like you as a boss.

20:48.218 --> 20:50.095
What about the chamois?

20:50.134 --> 20:52.300
It was for wiping things.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.919
(Groans)

20:55.107 --> 20:56.554
No. No. I won't go.

20:56.674 --> 20:59.357
No, this is too easy, Carmen!

20:59.391 --> 21:01.293
I didn't fight for you last time.

21:01.566 --> 21:04.094
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.

21:05.086 --> 21:06.978
I have a lot of mopping to do.

21:07.098 --> 21:10.467
Well, then, I'm gonna
stand right here beside you,

21:10.486 --> 21:11.858
and I'm gonna watch you mop.

21:11.978 --> 21:14.299
Well, I can't if you're
in the middle of the floor.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.169
Well, I have to show you that
I'm not giving up on this.

21:17.161 --> 21:18.561
Where do you want me to stand?

21:19.027 --> 21:20.462
I don't know. On the toilet?

21:20.517 --> 21:23.080
Fine. Just...

21:24.990 --> 21:27.151
(Grunts)

21:27.169 --> 21:30.154
(Shoes squeak)

21:32.724 --> 21:35.032
You're beautiful.
