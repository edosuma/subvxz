WEBVTT

02:38.636 --> 02:40.682
Come on.
Let'’s go. Marie?

02:41.944 --> 02:42.988
The 6:30s are here.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.076
The serving staff
is on the floor.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
It'’s time.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.079
Perhaps you should
say something?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.473
Ordering
one hamachi crudo,
two salad niçoises

02:49.647 --> 02:51.040
and one striped bass.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.694
Merde!Sebastian.Huh?

02:52.868 --> 02:54.870
We eighty-sixed the bass
an hour ago.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.699
Why is table 42
expecting something
we can'’t deliver?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.353
There was
a miscommunication.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.658
"Miscommunication."

03:00.832 --> 03:02.269
I speak four languages,

03:02.443 --> 03:03.879
and you'’re talking to me
about miscommunication?

03:04.053 --> 03:05.141
Calm down.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.795
Your face will scare
the customers.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.797
My kitchen, my face,
my rules.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.102
And what'’s
my rule number one?

03:10.277 --> 03:11.321
Do not fuck
with your kitchen.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.583
Voilà.

03:12.757 --> 03:13.976
Service!

03:14.150 --> 03:16.805
Welcome to Etoile Rouge.
Right this way.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.299
Bon appétit.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.871
All right.
How much longer until
I have my veggies done?

03:41.133 --> 03:42.657
Come on, guys.
I need them faster. Come on.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.093
Chef Ana?Yes?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.703
The patrons could
really use some face time.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.531
I don'’t have the time.They paid for a meal,

03:47.705 --> 03:49.359
but they also paid
to be schmoozed.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

03:50.882 --> 03:51.753
Show it to me.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.015
No. No. No.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.104
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.846
Look, the beurre blanc
is separated.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.587
Oui, Chef.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.153
It might taste the same,
but I know,

04:01.328 --> 04:03.504
and you really should know,
it'’s not right.

04:03.678 --> 04:04.896
Oui, Chef.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.072
Let me show you, okay?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.510
And then quickly,
but no rush.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.468
Yes. Of course.Like this. Yeah?

04:11.642 --> 04:12.643
Yes.Try.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.560
Faster.
As fast as you can.

04:16.734 --> 04:17.953
Sorry.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.129
Don'’t apologize.
Just practice.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.349
Good. Good.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.873
Practice until
you can do it in your sleep.

04:30.139 --> 04:33.795
Good evening, Chef.Good evening, husband.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.666
I told him not to.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.059
You must be lost, Ray.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.147
The bar is in front.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.540
Aren'’t you funny?

04:39.714 --> 04:41.281
You must be the first
Frenchman in history

04:41.455 --> 04:43.065
not to back down from a fight.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.546
Okay, that'’s enough.
Back to work.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.113
Et toi, ma chérie.
You'’re fired.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.898
You can'’t fire the owner.

04:50.072 --> 04:53.162
Half owner,
and this half is mine,
so out.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.685
I come bearing gifts.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.470
No.
Put it in the freezer.No, no--

04:56.644 --> 04:57.819
That'’s your answer
for everything.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.342
I think you better
take a look at this.

05:09.134 --> 05:10.527
It'’s nice, isn'’t it?

05:10.701 --> 05:12.312
How--
How did you do this?

05:12.486 --> 05:14.488
You have your talents,
I have mine.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.579
You better be ready
to get real busy.

05:20.015 --> 05:20.755
Well done, Ray.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.626
Oh, thanks, Frenchman.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.150
Coming from you,
that'’s a-- a compliment.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.023
Come on. You gotta
go show your face
to the hungry people.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.372
Oh, no, no, no, darling.
I'’m busy.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.113
Look,
I'’m preparing the--

05:31.287 --> 05:33.289
Hey, I'’ve been bragging
about you all night out there.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.899
If you don'’t come with me
and show your face,

05:35.073 --> 05:36.553
they'’re gonna think
I'’m a loser. Come on.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.686
You know I prefer
the kitchen, not--

05:38.860 --> 05:39.948
I know, the spotlight.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.603
But you gotta meet
the hungry people.

05:42.777 --> 05:45.649
So
this Parisian chef says,

05:45.823 --> 05:48.130
"If you don'’t come back
with 50 pounds of salmon,

05:48.304 --> 05:50.350
you'’re gonna have
a hundred pounds of
pissed-off Russian."

05:52.221 --> 05:54.005
So I said,
"Tell me more."

05:54.179 --> 05:55.877
And that'’s how I met my wife.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.313
There you have it.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.664
Set up on a blind date
by a dead fish. Enjoy.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.366
Get the back door open.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.758
Open the back door!

06:07.932 --> 06:09.934
Out of the way! Idiot!

06:10.108 --> 06:11.066
What'’s going on?

06:11.849 --> 06:13.285
What'’s happening here, guys?

06:15.157 --> 06:16.114
What'’s happening?

06:16.288 --> 06:17.681
Back to work,
all of you!

06:17.855 --> 06:19.248
The first night,
and we'’re messing it all up!

06:19.422 --> 06:20.641
Chef.Yes.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.165
Uh, phone for you.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.384
Sebastian, come on.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.733
Try not to burn
the kitchen down.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.474
It'’s the first day.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.128
Hello? Hello?

06:42.097 --> 06:43.577
Everything
all right, Chef?

06:43.751 --> 06:45.666
Huh? Yes. Yes.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.668
Everything'’s fine.

06:47.842 --> 06:51.019
As long as the restaurant
doesn'’t burn, we'’re good.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.760
Let'’s get back to work.
Come on.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.631
Oui, Chef.

06:54.805 --> 06:55.806
Imbeciles!

06:56.894 --> 06:58.679
Back to work,
all of you.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.724
I'’m gonna go out
on the sidewalk,

07:00.898 --> 07:03.423
tell the waiters
that it'’s safe
to come back in.

07:05.468 --> 07:09.080
I am so sorry, ma'’am.
We are all booked for tonight.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.301
I'’m telling you,
Paris was insane.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.694
We'’d walk out of the clubs,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.739
we'’d all be drunk
and stumbling around.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.568
I mean, it was one party
right after another.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.440
Richard,
it'’s getting late.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.790
Well, thanks
for the drink, Ray.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.313
Ah, pleasure.Nice to meet you.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.228
Ah, look after yourself.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.796
We have reached
our turnover early.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.275
Can I start taking walk-ins?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.973
No. No walk-ins.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.366
I'’d rather be in the red
than to take walk-ins.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.759
Fully booked.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.065
That'’s what we show
the world tonight.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.545
Okay, I'’ll turn away
this two-top.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.677
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Guests.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.679
Not a two-top,
not a four-top.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.333
We'’re not an Applebee'’s.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.856
You'’re in
the big leagues now.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.336
My fault.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.120
Guests, right.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.470
I'’ll take care
of these two.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.345
Why don'’t you get
drinks for that two-top
you just seated?

08:00.175 --> 08:01.742
Ray, you handsome devil.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.354
I mean, this place is...

08:05.528 --> 08:06.529
Wow.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.400
Thanks, Mickey.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.402
What'’s up, fellas?

08:12.448 --> 08:13.971
We'’re starving.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.799
Just have your mama
cook for you.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.061
That'’s fucked up.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.415
You know,
my mother'’s dead,
God rest her soul.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.592
What do you want?

08:28.159 --> 08:30.074
Dom wants to talk.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.685
Tell him I'’ll call him
in the morning.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.251
That'’s not gonna work.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.733
Come on, bozo. Look around.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.040
We'’re busy. It'’s a bad time.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.869
He wants to talk now.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.309
Just tell him I'’ll call him
in the morning.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.616
Yeah,
he'’s not gonna do that.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.621
Come on. We'’re friends.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.928
I'’ll talk to him,
and it'’ll all work out.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.451
It'’s tonight, Ray.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.934
Mickey. Come on, man.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.240
It'’s opening night.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.503
It'’s opening night.

09:09.157 --> 09:12.029
I don'’t give a shit
if it'’s opening night.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.117
Listen to me.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.250
It'’s tonight.

09:15.424 --> 09:19.689
Dom told me tonight.
I told you it'’s tonight.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.910
And you always do what Daddy
tells you to do, don'’t you?

09:25.782 --> 09:27.828
I'’m next in line, Ray.
Show a little respect.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.830
Respect is earned.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.796
I'’ll talk to him
in the morning.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.103
We'’ll work it out.
Don'’t worry.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.585
Tonight, Ray.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.765
Let'’s get outta here.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.379
Terminé.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.163
Speech, speech.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.339
Speech, speech,
speech, speech.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.647
Okay.
Thank you.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.432
Uh, this place is what
I'’ve always wanted,

10:07.607 --> 10:11.132
Um, and it'’s thanks to you
that I stand here,

10:11.306 --> 10:13.656
the proud owner
of Etoile Rouge.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.092
Half owner.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.790
This is a special night.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.098
And hopefully
just the beginning.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.667
And, yeah, thank you, guys.

10:24.841 --> 10:28.323
Thank you
for not fucking it up.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.763
So let'’s celebrate.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.418
That is all,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.551
The kitchen is now closed.
Let'’s drink.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.031
Na zdorovie.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.733
Hey, boss, are we gonna
do this or what?

10:52.695 --> 10:54.915
I left my dad a message.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.526
We'’re not doing nothing
till he gets back to me.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.137
He did say
it was tonight.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.359
Yeah.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.666
I know what he said.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.756
He said it to me, genius.
I told you that.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.628
I'’m just saying.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.413
So...

11:17.633 --> 11:19.200
we'’re just gonna wait here?

11:19.374 --> 11:22.682
Did I fucking stutter? Huh?

11:26.381 --> 11:27.904
He'’s getting a massage,

11:28.078 --> 11:29.819
and when he'’s getting
a massage,

11:29.993 --> 11:31.647
he don'’t like to be bothered.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.346
It ruins the mood.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.003
I never
got a massage before.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.614
You gotta do
those things naked?

11:44.442 --> 11:47.010
Why the fuck
would you go naked?

11:47.881 --> 11:49.186
I heard you gotta
do it naked.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.493
Just shut up.
Everybody shut up.

11:53.321 --> 11:56.324
And get off the fucking car.
I just had it washed.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.505
That Ray.
Some balls on that guy, huh?

12:04.593 --> 12:07.291
Yeah. Not for long.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.771
Yeah.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.252
I'’d like to see that.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.386
Oh, you'’re gonna see
something, lollipop.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.825
Okay, we'’ll see.Yeah, lollipop.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.091
Cheers.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.010
It'’s disgusting.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.448
How does it feel?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.276
What do you mean?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.017
To have your own place.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.932
Yeah, it feels good.
Um...

12:39.933 --> 12:41.456
A little stressful.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.110
Ay, caramba.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.025
You did it, Ana.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.419
I know you can'’t
tell right now,
but you did it.

12:48.593 --> 12:49.943
This is the start
of something--

12:50.117 --> 12:51.509
CÇa va, Sebastian?

12:59.735 --> 13:02.782
So...
...did you always
wanna be a chef?

13:04.435 --> 13:06.829
No. Not always, no.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.486
Well, you'’re really
good at it.

13:13.009 --> 13:13.967
Thank you.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.578
You know, it'’s not just me.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.493
Ray has done so much for me.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.799
Mmm.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.978
And I'’m sure
he'’s somewhere here,

13:25.152 --> 13:27.241
supporting me, right?

13:28.938 --> 13:32.594
Whoa.
That'’s some
pretty good stuff, Ricky.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.335
All right.
I got a second wind.

13:34.509 --> 13:35.945
Let'’s go.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.904
I think we gotta get home.
It'’s getting late.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.167
Aw, come on.
We just got started, man.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.777
Well, I'’m out of money.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.780
Here. Problem solved.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.087
Sorry, Ray.
We gotta get going.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.958
Party'’s over.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.308
Give them their tips back
and go home.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.137
There you go, guys.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.400
Leave me enough
for cab fare, will you?

13:56.574 --> 13:58.011
And I mean you too, huh?

13:59.186 --> 14:00.927
Wanna play a game,
just you and me?

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
Well, you know,
I gotta work.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.105
I need to prepare
demiglace for tomorrow.

14:05.888 --> 14:06.933
You never stop.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.370
All right.
I'’ll see you when I see you.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.198
Mm-hmm. Beso.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.156
Don'’t be all night.Mmm.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.592
Good night.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.029
I'’ll walk you out.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.682
Eliza, how did we do?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.598
Everything was great.
Cash till looks promising.

14:20.772 --> 14:21.948
Great. Thank you.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.601
You'’re staying?

14:23.775 --> 14:26.822
Oh, she'’s gonna smoke
and pace and pace and smoke.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.693
She gets all jacked up
on the adrenaline.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.957
Mm-hmm. Well, at least
that'’s all I'’m jacked up on.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.132
Oh.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.829
Good night.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.780
My feet are killing me.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.913
What you ladies
put up with is crazy.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.655
Look who it is.Oh, shit.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.440
Aren'’t those the two guys
for the restaurant?

15:19.614 --> 15:22.573
A legend.
Who'’s the hooker?

15:24.358 --> 15:26.186
Isn'’t it past
your bedtime, Mickey?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.536
Now,
why you gotta be
crazy like that?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.190
I let you have
your big night out.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.453
Now, come on.
I'’ve had it up to here
with you.

15:32.627 --> 15:33.976
Come on. Go home.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.978
This is between me and Dom.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.980
I'’ll work something out.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.983
Well, he sent me
to handle it.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.987
So I'’m handling it.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.383
Ray.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.863
Freaks come out
at night, baby.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.956
All right.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.784
Enough of this
take-your-child-
to-work-day bullshit.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.962
You know, I think
all of this Viagra

16:03.136 --> 16:05.486
has caused you
some serious hearing loss.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.924
It'’s tonight, lollipop.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.926
Yeah. All right, Mickey.
Whatever you say.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.493
What are they talking about?Nothing.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.625
They'’re talking about nothing.
They just talk.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.112
Oops.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.418
Thanks.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.552
She'’ll be fine.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.164
Let'’s go, Ray.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.254
I'’m not fucking around,
Ray.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.865
Ray! Let'’s go.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.301
Be careful.
It'’s heavy.

17:21.475 --> 17:22.954
Yeah,
I know it'’s heavy.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.871
I am using my back!

17:30.179 --> 17:31.398
Look,
the lights are still on.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.834
Yeah, and?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.489
It smells good in here.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.621
It'’s about to
smell a whole lot worse.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.940
Yeah, Ray. Leave a message.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.249
Yo, Meatball.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.599
This pot'’s hot.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.434
So what?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.436
Place is supposed
to be empty.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.569
Shut the fuck up.
We got a job to do.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.710
Hand me your lighter.

18:22.884 --> 18:23.928
What?

18:25.365 --> 18:27.062
Give me your lighter.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.369
I don'’t got one.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.675
How the fuck do you smoke
and you don'’t have a lighter?

18:32.981 --> 18:34.025
I quit.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.551
Fuck, we'’re in a kitchen.
There'’s gotta be one
around here.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.640
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.649
What?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.246
"Wifey."

20:04.420 --> 20:05.987
She'’s calling you, Ray.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.729
Let me talk to her.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.122
You think I'’m an idiot?

20:11.949 --> 20:13.212
Yes.

20:15.649 --> 20:16.998
Ray?

20:17.172 --> 20:20.175
Lady, you got
bad taste in men.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.872
Who'’s this?

20:22.046 --> 20:24.266
"Who is this?"
That don'’t matter.
"Who is this?"

20:25.224 --> 20:26.573
Where'’s Ray?

20:26.747 --> 20:28.183
Handsome Ray
is right here with me.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.316
Put him on.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.535
You don'’t like talking
to me, lollipop?

20:34.494 --> 20:36.713
Put my husband on the phone.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.019
Or what?

20:40.543 --> 20:43.329
I'’m not a person
you wanna fuck with.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.594
Then you'’re not gonna like
what we did to your restaurant.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.335
What did you do
to my restaurant?

20:49.509 --> 20:51.598
It'’s in flames.

20:51.772 --> 20:55.689
Big, bright, orange,
gorgeous flames.

20:55.863 --> 20:56.994
Oh, is it?

21:02.870 --> 21:04.611
Listen to me.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.570
You better get
out of there right now
before we torch the place,

21:07.744 --> 21:10.878
or your opening night
is gonna be your last night.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.184
I doubt it.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.843
She hung up on me, Ray!

21:23.325 --> 21:24.413
Shit.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.298
Ana.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.212
Oh, honey.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.085
Thank God you'’re okay.

21:45.608 --> 21:46.870
Is that a gun?

21:47.044 --> 21:49.308
Oh, just for emergencies.
Don'’t worry.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.702
What-- Where did
you get a gun?

21:54.138 --> 21:55.357
I had it.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.185
Is that blood?

21:57.359 --> 22:00.014
Yeah, but--What the fuck is going on?

22:00.188 --> 22:01.798
Stay calm. Calm.Whose blood is that?

22:01.972 --> 22:03.452
No, don'’t-- don'’t
open the door, Ray. Don'’t--

22:05.976 --> 22:07.326
Oh, fuck.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.329
Oh, fuck.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.114
Dom is gonna kill me.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.682
Who? Who'’s Dom?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.337
A bad man.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.124
Why is he
gonna kill you?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.434
Ray!

22:28.608 --> 22:30.871
Sorry, I-I-I didn'’t know.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.221
You didn'’t know what?

22:35.876 --> 22:37.312
I thought
there would be more time.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.227
I didn'’t know
it was gonna be tonight.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.621
Ray, what did you do?

22:46.843 --> 22:48.105
I fucked up.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.848
I owe a lot of money,

22:52.022 --> 22:54.242
and I thought
I could pay it back,

22:54.416 --> 22:56.853
you know,
when the restaurant
got successful.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.380
How much do you owe?

23:03.251 --> 23:04.383
A lot.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.559
How much, Ray?

23:08.169 --> 23:09.649
1.2.

23:11.607 --> 23:14.088
Million?

23:15.132 --> 23:17.004
1.3 if you round.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.310
Oh, God. All right.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.790
Get a little deeper there.

23:20.964 --> 23:23.010
Yeah. Oh, shit.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.315
Not that deep.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.362
Oh, goddamn, Gary.

23:28.842 --> 23:32.149
Who the fuck?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.979
Get that, will you, Gar?Yes, sir.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.068
What?

23:38.242 --> 23:40.723
Sorry to bother you, Pops.
I know it ruins the mood.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.247
Get to the point.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.902
Well, we got a little
situation going on.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.731
And you can'’t handle it?

23:48.905 --> 23:52.996
I can. I just wanted to,
you know, make you awares,
check-in.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.045
This wasn'’t supposed
to be difficult, Mick.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.090
That'’s why I sent you
to take care of it.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.833
I am taking care of it.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.922
Oh, not that, Gary.
Not that deep.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.707
Son of a bitch.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.012
If you were taking care of it,

24:09.186 --> 24:10.753
we wouldn'’t be talking
right now.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.887
Look, Dad...

24:16.803 --> 24:18.848
Can you just send me
a couple more guys?

24:19.022 --> 24:21.329
What happened to
the guys that you had?

24:21.503 --> 24:24.898
Gio and the pip-squeak,
what'’s-his-name.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.770
You know that jerk, Ray,
he really fucked us
on this one, Dad.

24:28.684 --> 24:29.685
What?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.472
Oh, goddamn!Oh, sorry. Okay.

24:33.646 --> 24:34.951
Put him on.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.127
Can'’t do that.

24:38.825 --> 24:39.826
Why not?

24:40.740 --> 24:41.915
'’Cause he'’s inside,

24:42.089 --> 24:43.612
holed up
with that Russian lady.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.266
I gotta tell you,
I don'’t like her one bit.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.486
I'’m on my way. No, no, no.

24:47.660 --> 24:48.835
Just-- Just-- Just send--

24:49.009 --> 24:50.750
Jesus, man.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.752
Let this be
a lesson to you, Gary.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.493
If you ever want
something done right,

24:54.667 --> 24:57.147
don'’t ask your jerk-off son
to do it for you.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.717
I'’m still on the line,
Dad.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.503
Then hang the fuck up,
idiot.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.611
Ray, what did you do?

25:27.003 --> 25:28.222
They wanna burn down
the restaurant

25:28.396 --> 25:30.267
for the insurance money.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.095
And you'’re okay with that?

25:32.269 --> 25:35.664
No. Fuck no,
I'’m not okay--
I don'’t have a choice.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.101
Please tell me
it wasn'’t your idea.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.147
No, it wasn'’t.

25:40.321 --> 25:43.193
Maybe-- Maybe a little.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.500
But, Ana,

25:47.023 --> 25:49.286
I really believed
that we could
make this place work.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.724
It would'’ve been great."Would have been"?

25:53.377 --> 25:55.597
You'’re giving up already?
That'’s it?

25:58.992 --> 26:00.297
Sweetheart,
we don'’t have a choice.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.169
No, you don'’t have a choice.

26:02.343 --> 26:05.302
You'’re so
fucking irresponsible.

26:05.476 --> 26:06.826
I'’m sorry.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.349
Not sorry enough.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.482
What if--Shut up!

26:15.312 --> 26:17.271
No wonder
you'’ve been divorced twice.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.794
Now I get it.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.712
That'’s a little
below the belt,
don'’t you think?

26:28.499 --> 26:30.153
I fucked up,

26:30.327 --> 26:31.590
but I love you.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.766
I truly love you.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.639
And if I could go back
and change all of this,

26:37.813 --> 26:39.946
I would do it
in a nanosecond.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.515
Well, you can'’t,
and you lied to me.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.259
What about you?

26:49.433 --> 26:50.739
What about--
What about this?

26:50.913 --> 26:53.002
What-- What about them?
Did you kill '’em?

26:56.789 --> 26:58.399
You really wanna know?

27:06.886 --> 27:09.584
Ana, talk to me.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.674
I, uh...

27:17.374 --> 27:19.550
I used to work for the KGB.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.816
Like Russian KGB?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.342
Yes.

27:32.389 --> 27:33.521
You'’re a spy.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.264
I'’m a chef.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.662
Wait, wait.

27:45.272 --> 27:48.579
I mean, that'’s not
something that
you just walk away from.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.886
How did you get out?I managed.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.148
I disappeared,

27:52.322 --> 27:53.759
until you fucking
put me on the map

27:53.933 --> 27:55.369
with that stupid announcement.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.546
How was I supposed to know
that you were fucking KGB?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.330
No, ex-KGB.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.810
All right,
so what now?

28:03.638 --> 28:05.161
Is the KGB
gonna come after you?

28:05.335 --> 28:06.380
No.

28:07.555 --> 28:08.599
Maybe.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.564
So I guess we'’re both
full of shit.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.392
No, except I lied
to protect you.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.960
No, you lied
to protect you.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.222
What the fuck do you know?

28:36.279 --> 28:38.281
Don'’t be mad. Don'’t be mad.
Don'’t be mad.

28:38.455 --> 28:39.979
I can fix this.

28:40.153 --> 28:41.632
Why am I here, then,

28:41.807 --> 28:44.331
when I should be getting
a fucking massage?

28:44.505 --> 28:46.507
I got a plan.You got a plan?

28:46.681 --> 28:49.336
The only plan you got is
I got a plan.

28:49.510 --> 28:53.906
A Russian problem calls for
a Russian solution, right?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.956
You had your chance, Mickey.

29:01.130 --> 29:04.177
Leo, Tommy, Billy, let'’s go.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.614
I did what I had to.
I had no choice!

29:06.788 --> 29:08.268
Welcome to the fucking club.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.096
That'’s not the same thing.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.185
It is exactly
the same fucking thing.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.188
I tried so hard to get rid
of one thing in my life,

29:15.362 --> 29:17.016
and here you are,
fucking it up

29:17.190 --> 29:18.887
like you fucked up
everything else.

29:20.454 --> 29:21.585
I can fix this.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.501
Let me talk to them.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.547
Talk to him?
Talking will do nothing.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.985
You don'’t know these guys.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.596
They'’re not gonna
walk away from this.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.861
There'’s a lot of money
on the line,
and there'’s a lot of them.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.124
I don'’t care.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.517
Dom is not somebody
you wanna fuck with.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.567
I'’m not somebody
you wanna fuck with.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.351
Let me talk to them.

29:48.525 --> 29:51.224
He needs me alive.
He'’s not gonna kill me.

29:51.398 --> 29:52.834
He needs me breathing

29:53.008 --> 29:55.881
so he can collect on
the insurance money.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.579
I can reason with him.
He'’s a reasonable guy.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.711
He'’s a reason--
Did he just say
he'’s a reasonable guy?

30:00.886 --> 30:02.583
Oh, no, no.Did you just say
he'’s a reasonable guy?

30:02.757 --> 30:03.889
No, we'’re not going
down that road.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.412
No, wait, wait.
You like that word.

30:05.586 --> 30:06.630
We'’re not going down--You like that word.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.936
No, we'’re not doing--

30:08.110 --> 30:09.808
You call me unreasonable
all the time!

30:11.461 --> 30:13.028
And what do I do?

30:13.202 --> 30:14.334
I cook.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.076
Sometimes I shout.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.340
And that makes me
unreasonable?

30:20.514 --> 30:26.041
This guy wants to burn down
a perfectly good restaurant,
and he'’s the reasonable one.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.914
That'’s not what I'’m saying.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.178
No?No,
we'’re on the same team.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.180
No, we are not
on the same team.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.139
You want to talk to people

30:37.313 --> 30:39.576
that want to
burn this place down.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.188
And what do you wanna do?
You wanna kill '’em?

30:45.234 --> 30:48.324
I won'’t let them
burn down my restaurant.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.197
Our restaurant?

30:53.547 --> 30:54.722
I'’ll talk to them.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.986
It'’s the only way.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.861
If you'’re not gonna
be reasonable, I will.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.256
Dom!

31:08.692 --> 31:09.955
I just wanna talk.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.450
What'’s going on, Ray?

31:28.582 --> 31:30.801
You can'’t burn it down.
Not yet.

31:32.542 --> 31:33.587
Why is that?

31:34.893 --> 31:38.070
Give us a chance to
really make it work, please.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.115
I got a good feeling
about this place.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.987
And you had
a good feeling about

31:42.161 --> 31:44.119
the last four restaurants too.
Do you remember that?

31:44.293 --> 31:46.600
Yeah, I know, I know,
but this one'’s different.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.776
It'’s not working
for me, Ray.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.606
Is that all you got
is a good feeling?

31:52.780 --> 31:54.434
Come on,
don'’t bust my balls.

31:54.608 --> 31:57.480
All right, look.
I got a really
good feeling. All right?

31:57.654 --> 31:59.221
Is that--
Does that work?

31:59.395 --> 32:01.571
Doesn'’t mean much
coming from you.

32:05.184 --> 32:06.359
Dom, please.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.404
Ray...

32:09.101 --> 32:10.885
take solace in the fact

32:11.059 --> 32:14.149
that you didn'’t run this one
into the ground.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.805
You burned it.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.270
You think
they got her?

32:48.444 --> 32:50.707
Enough bullshit.
Mickey, you'’re up.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.796
Burn this place to the ground.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.582
Dom, please. Come on.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.497
Hello? Mimi?

33:41.671 --> 33:43.804
Ana, is that you?

33:45.588 --> 33:46.807
Yes.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.636
How are you?

33:50.376 --> 33:52.117
Um...

33:53.466 --> 33:54.728
I need your help.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.515
Well, this is a blast
from the past, isn'’t it?

34:00.908 --> 34:02.736
Same old shit,
like the old days.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.738
You get in some shit,
and you call me
to bail you out?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.221
Yes.

34:09.395 --> 34:10.874
Hmm.
So you need my help.

34:13.355 --> 34:16.663
There are some men trying
to burn down my restaurant.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.623
Oh, no.
On opening night?

34:21.450 --> 34:22.538
Yeah.

34:22.712 --> 34:23.539
Well, that'’s
just rude.

34:24.497 --> 34:25.498
How many are we talking?

34:25.672 --> 34:27.543
Not sure yet.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.806
But can you help?

34:31.982 --> 34:33.941
Well, what choice
do I have, Ana?

34:34.115 --> 34:36.900
If you'’re calling me,
I'’m guessing
it'’s an emergency, right?

34:37.988 --> 34:39.642
It is, yeah. Um...

34:40.730 --> 34:41.905
Could you hurry?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.516
I will, babe.
Don'’t worry.

34:43.690 --> 34:46.127
A road to a friend'’s house
is never long.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.784
And we are friends,
right?

34:50.958 --> 34:53.787
Even after
all these years?

34:54.744 --> 34:56.920
Yeah, friends.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.184
Good.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.101
Protect yourself, Anya.
We'’ll see you soon.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.973
Mimi, listen.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.148
Uh...

35:08.106 --> 35:10.064
I just want you to know I--

35:10.238 --> 35:12.501
You know, when I left-- No, no, no, no, no. No.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.330
We will chitchat all about it
when I get there, '’kay?

35:15.504 --> 35:16.636
Can'’t wait.

35:24.296 --> 35:26.036
This one'’s clean.Please stop
singing that.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.736
Let'’s go.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.346
We'’re leaving?Yes, pack your shit.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.565
Let'’s go.Okay.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.262
Girls, we'’re--Come on, girls.

35:34.436 --> 35:35.437
Who was that?

35:37.918 --> 35:40.312
It'’s simple. You just run in,
throw it on the ground. Boom.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.009
I don'’t take orders
from you.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.403
This comes direct
from my pops.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.056
He told you to do it.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.537
And I'’m telling you.
It'’s called delegating.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.539
It'’s what leadership is.

35:50.713 --> 35:51.758
Now go.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.941
Come on.
Are you scared?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.379
I'’ll tell my dad
you did a good job.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.642
Just do this thing.
It'’s gonna be huge.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.949
You do it.
You'’re not gonna convince me.

36:09.123 --> 36:10.516
You'’re being insubordinate.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.561
Grow your balls and listen.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.260
No way.
It'’s not gonna happen.Fucking idiots.

36:18.306 --> 36:19.481
Here, let'’s go.

36:20.830 --> 36:21.875
Let'’s go.

36:22.789 --> 36:23.833
You got it.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.066
You can do it.

36:51.470 --> 36:52.862
Come on.

37:06.833 --> 37:07.877
Shit.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.749
Just saying,
if we get pulled over,
it'’s gonna slow us down.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.577
Okay. Thanks, Tom.Y-You'’re welcome.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.584
Going fast.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.194
Driving fast, too fast.

38:04.369 --> 38:05.544
I think the speed limit'’s
actually--

38:05.718 --> 38:06.849
Oh, my God, you'’re really--

38:07.023 --> 38:07.894
Tom.Yeah.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.730
You know what this
reminds me of?

38:21.647 --> 38:23.431
Bucharest?Yeah, Bucharest.

38:23.605 --> 38:26.304
Remember that was--
that was a--
that was a good one.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.959
You were good
in Bucharest.I was.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.441
I mean, yeah,
because we sma--

38:33.615 --> 38:35.791
Remember we smashed into
the dog park
and those really angry--

38:35.965 --> 38:37.837
It was a mission, Tom.
And was it successful?

38:38.011 --> 38:39.186
It was
a successful mission.It was.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.405
Yeah.

38:41.667 --> 38:42.755
This isn'’t a mission.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.409
Nobody likes
a back-seat driver, Tom.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.062
I'’m sitting in the front.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.064
Why did we have to come?Excuse me, lady.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.936
You know exactly why.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.720
I have homework, Mimi.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.809
Do not
fucking call me, Mimi.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.551
The last time
you had "homework,"
we came home to a party.

38:56.725 --> 38:57.944
It was sociology.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.467
And it was
a get-together, so--

38:59.641 --> 39:00.947
Yeah, okay,
so that'’s your truth.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.949
Just listen to your Mimi--
Mommy-- your mother.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.168
Listen-- Look,
it was just a suggestion.
If you slow down--

39:05.343 --> 39:07.780
Okay, well, I suggest that
you mind your own business.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.259
Thank you
for that suggestion.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.698
I'’m just trying to help.Okay, you can help.

39:12.872 --> 39:15.875
Just do it silently
inside your mind.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.968
Dr. Gottlieb says that
we should have an open forum--You know what?

39:22.142 --> 39:24.971
If Dr. fucking Gottlieb
knows so much,

39:25.145 --> 39:28.104
why has she been married
three times, huh, Tom?

39:28.278 --> 39:30.629
Oh, my God,
just get fucking
divorced already.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.326
Language.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.284
Do you realize
how much you guys
are screwing us up?

39:34.459 --> 39:37.113
Okay, your mother and I
are just working
through a cloudy yesterday

39:37.287 --> 39:39.420
to get to
a sunny tomorrow sometime.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.204
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, right.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.555
Jesus Christ, Tom.

39:43.729 --> 39:47.559
She'’s really gotten to you.
You remembered that thing
hanging above her wall?

39:50.257 --> 39:51.171
TROMP.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.695
Oh, Lord.TROMP!

39:55.436 --> 39:57.743
Trust, respect,
open-mindedness, positivity.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.266
TROMP.Mm-hmm.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.876
If you can'’t handle all four,
just pick one.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.966
Okay, I will pick one.
I pick positivity.Puh!

40:05.098 --> 40:07.187
I'’m positive
Dr. fucking Gottlieb

40:07.361 --> 40:10.190
hasn'’t gotten laid
since the Berlin Wall.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.281
Makes three of us.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.501
Well, then take
some fucking initiative.

40:19.025 --> 40:21.419
Oh, God.

40:24.596 --> 40:27.816
I'’m just gonna make
an observation.
You'’re driving like a maniac.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.340
And I think this is
a personal vendetta
against your best friend.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.778
Ex-best friend,
current enemy.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.129
And will you have
my fucking back?

40:40.568 --> 40:41.656
It'’s okay, girls.

40:54.669 --> 40:57.193
Keep it locked up.
Keep the riffraff out.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.717
Shouldn'’t be a long night.

40:59.369 --> 41:00.327
Thanks for coming out.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.460
No sweat.
You got it, boss.

41:06.681 --> 41:09.771
Six guys in,
no guys out?

41:09.945 --> 41:12.644
Shit, man. Man,
this is some bullshit.

41:12.818 --> 41:15.124
Gary, focus, please.Man, I am focused.

41:15.298 --> 41:16.865
That'’s how
I gather myself, okay?

41:18.301 --> 41:19.868
I'’m just a masseuse.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.566
I shouldn'’t even
be here.

41:22.958 --> 41:24.090
Shit!

41:25.831 --> 41:27.528
Don'’t be a bitch, man.
Come on.

41:31.401 --> 41:32.490
Come on!

41:32.664 --> 41:36.319
Shut up.
God, please help me.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.973
Gary, what are you
waiting for?
Let'’s go.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.932
Ah!

41:41.368 --> 41:43.413
Okay, come on. Go.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.199
It'’s not locked.
You go first. You go first.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.201
No, get your
Black ass in there.

41:48.375 --> 41:51.204
That'’s some racist shit.
You can'’t say that shit.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.293
My bad. My bad.
You'’re right.

42:07.176 --> 42:08.613
I'’ma go towards
the office, all right?

42:08.787 --> 42:09.831
You go right there, boy.

42:11.441 --> 42:12.530
You got that, right?

42:26.021 --> 42:26.892
Bobby!

42:27.893 --> 42:29.285
I'’m scared!
Open up, man!

42:29.459 --> 42:31.940
Okay. A little bit of Ali.
A little bit of Jackie.

42:40.906 --> 42:41.733
Okay.

42:43.125 --> 42:45.693
Let'’s do this.
I got you, okay?

42:51.873 --> 42:55.311
You better get her, Bobby!
Yeah! Whup her ass, boy!

43:03.668 --> 43:05.757
Kill that bitch!
Kill that bitch, Bobby!

43:16.115 --> 43:17.725
Bobby, is she dead?

43:23.644 --> 43:25.298
What the fuck--

43:31.260 --> 43:32.958
No. No! No!

43:35.003 --> 43:36.875
No! No!

43:37.049 --> 43:38.616
No!

43:49.061 --> 43:50.715
I didn'’t see that.
I didn'’t, I didn'’t.

43:50.889 --> 43:53.543
One more time.
Okay, that'’s just--

43:56.285 --> 43:57.722
Shit.

43:57.896 --> 43:59.071
Bobby, Bobby.
Please, come on, Bobby.

44:00.942 --> 44:03.858
No, stay down.
Be quiet. Be quiet, be quiet.

44:04.032 --> 44:06.556
Okay, look!
I'’m blind.

44:06.731 --> 44:08.950
I didn'’t see your face
or the dead bodies.

44:09.124 --> 44:11.170
Aah! I didn'’t see nothing!

44:11.344 --> 44:12.388
Oh, shit! Please!

44:15.696 --> 44:17.567
Please!

44:17.742 --> 44:19.482
You got 90 seconds
before the oil

44:19.657 --> 44:21.441
turns your fingers
into pommes frites.

44:21.615 --> 44:24.792
Come on. Oh, shit.
Look, lady, I only understand
American threats.

44:24.966 --> 44:26.664
It means french fries!

44:26.838 --> 44:28.796
Okay, look.

44:28.970 --> 44:32.191
Okay, look, my name is Gary,
and I'’m a Libra
and I like Chinese food.

44:32.365 --> 44:34.541
Who cares about
your fucking star sign?

44:34.715 --> 44:36.674
And I don'’t have no problems
with you at all.

44:36.848 --> 44:38.327
I have no problem
with you, Gary.

44:38.501 --> 44:40.939
I just have questions
and I want answers.

44:41.113 --> 44:42.418
Okay, look--

44:42.592 --> 44:45.117
Tell me about Dom!Well, shit.

44:45.291 --> 44:48.337
I think Dom, he'’s an Aquarius.
His birthday was two days ago.

44:48.511 --> 44:50.470
No! That'’s not
what I wanna know.Okay.

44:50.644 --> 44:53.212
Why does he wanna
burn down my restaurant?

44:53.386 --> 44:55.431
I don'’t know why!
I really don'’t know!

44:55.605 --> 44:56.868
Well,
you better fucking know

44:57.042 --> 44:58.957
because you'’ve got
60 seconds left.

44:59.131 --> 45:00.567
Okay, okay.
It'’s an insurance thing.

45:00.741 --> 45:02.700
It'’s very confusing, okay?
It'’s confusing.

45:02.874 --> 45:05.485
Why tonight?
Why tonight?I don'’t know!

45:05.659 --> 45:07.574
Because they got--
It'’s a war
between the families.

45:07.748 --> 45:10.533
And he gotta have--
He says gotta have cash
for the company.

45:10.708 --> 45:11.970
How many men
work for him?

45:12.144 --> 45:13.972
I don'’t know. I don'’t know.

45:14.146 --> 45:17.279
This is getting hot.
It'’s getting hot, please.

45:17.453 --> 45:19.412
That'’s the idea.

45:19.586 --> 45:22.067
Please, lady, look,
I'’m a masseuse!

45:22.241 --> 45:23.938
All I do is massage!What?

45:24.112 --> 45:26.027
Yes!
I need my hands!

45:26.201 --> 45:28.334
Please, let me go. Please.

45:28.508 --> 45:30.205
Oh,
stop fucking shouting!

45:32.251 --> 45:33.774
Okay. Okay.

45:33.948 --> 45:36.821
Please, please, please.
Look. Okay.

45:36.995 --> 45:38.866
Okay, I just wanna say
thank you, first of all,

45:39.040 --> 45:40.825
for respecting
an artist'’s hands.

45:40.999 --> 45:42.609
You gonna kill me?

45:42.783 --> 45:44.567
Huh?

45:44.742 --> 45:46.352
I don'’t enjoy this.

45:47.962 --> 45:49.224
So you not
gonna kill me?

45:52.053 --> 45:53.359
Hell,
you could let me go.

45:57.929 --> 45:59.278
So you'’re a masseuse.

45:59.452 --> 46:01.584
Yes, I'’m--
I'’m a certified masseuse.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.499
I-- I do massages all day,

46:03.673 --> 46:06.285
and I can tell
you need a massage
right now.

46:06.459 --> 46:08.504
I can put my hands on you
and put '’em--

46:08.678 --> 46:09.854
You'’re Gary, huh?

46:10.028 --> 46:12.334
Yes, I am Gary.You a Libra?

46:12.508 --> 46:14.336
Yes, I am a Libra.

46:14.510 --> 46:17.035
If you don'’t like that,
I can change my sign
if you want to.

46:20.690 --> 46:21.996
What that mean?
What that mean?

46:22.170 --> 46:23.911
That mean you about to--
Some people coming in?

46:24.085 --> 46:26.827
It means get out of here, Gary,
before I change my mind.

46:27.959 --> 46:29.221
I understand that.

46:29.395 --> 46:31.832
But can I use
your restroom first, huh?

46:32.920 --> 46:35.053
Okay, I'’m out.
I don'’t like that look.

46:35.227 --> 46:36.619
Get the fuck out!Okay.

46:37.533 --> 46:39.013
Shit.

46:55.682 --> 46:57.727
We had some calls
about some gunfire
in the area.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.468
You know anything
about that?

46:59.642 --> 47:02.907
Uh, we'’re digging up
the gas main
at the restaurant.

47:03.081 --> 47:05.605
Jackhammer is gonna be
going on and off all night.

47:06.736 --> 47:08.260
Yeah.

47:08.434 --> 47:11.829
It'’s a residential area.
Got a lot of busybodies.

47:12.655 --> 47:13.831
I'’ll leave you to it.

47:34.242 --> 47:35.504
Ready?Ready.

47:36.723 --> 47:38.986
Seriously,
why do we have to be here?

47:39.160 --> 47:41.119
Because we don'’t trust you.

47:46.037 --> 47:47.952
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up there.

47:50.215 --> 47:51.738
Hello, ma'’am?

47:51.912 --> 47:55.220
Hello! Just passing through.

47:55.394 --> 47:57.309
I'’m sorry, ma'’am,
this road is closed.

47:57.483 --> 47:59.180
Closed? I--

47:59.354 --> 48:02.140
No, I'’m meeting a friend
at a restaurant
down the street.

48:02.314 --> 48:03.881
It'’s pretty late.

48:04.055 --> 48:05.578
I'’m pretty sure the restaurant'’s
not still open.

48:05.752 --> 48:07.928
No, no, no, I'’m sure
she'’s there waiting for me.

48:08.102 --> 48:10.888
I'’m sorry, ma'’am, no can do.
It'’s just not safe.

48:11.062 --> 48:12.063
You'’re gonna have
to call your friend.

48:12.237 --> 48:14.326
Oh, dear.You can loop back aro--

48:15.893 --> 48:17.111
Oh.

48:18.286 --> 48:20.593
Fun.Warn me next time.

48:20.767 --> 48:22.421
Oh, God.

48:36.609 --> 48:37.958
I understand.Pop!

48:39.394 --> 48:41.788
I said I understand that.

48:41.962 --> 48:43.790
I know it'’s short notice.Pop!

48:43.964 --> 48:46.010
But this
is a really big deal,

48:46.184 --> 48:48.664
and it'’s
gotta go down tonight.Pops!

48:49.448 --> 48:52.320
Alls I want is a quote.

48:53.017 --> 48:54.453
Three guys--

48:54.627 --> 48:55.933
No, make it four guys...

48:56.107 --> 48:57.760
Pops....for three hours.

49:00.111 --> 49:01.982
Can-- Can you gimme
one second, please?

49:03.331 --> 49:04.550
What?

49:08.423 --> 49:10.643
The guys
that just went in...

49:12.340 --> 49:13.776
they'’re gone too.

49:20.261 --> 49:22.220
She got Gary.

49:25.223 --> 49:26.572
She got Gary.

49:30.619 --> 49:31.794
Scratch that.

49:32.665 --> 49:34.710
I need 15 more.

49:34.884 --> 49:37.800
I don'’t care about the cost.
Just make it happen.

49:48.855 --> 49:50.857
Some time tonight
would be nice.

49:51.031 --> 49:53.816
I may work slowly,
but I always finish quickly.

49:54.904 --> 49:57.211
Oh, I know
you finish quickly, Tom.

49:59.039 --> 50:01.215
I won'’t let your stress
disrupt my peace.

50:01.389 --> 50:02.738
How long is this gonna take?

50:03.913 --> 50:05.089
I acknowledge
your impatience,

50:05.263 --> 50:06.916
but I don'’t have
an answer for that.

50:19.190 --> 50:21.888
So you'’re really
gonna do this.
You'’re gonna kill her.

50:27.415 --> 50:29.461
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know.

50:31.332 --> 50:32.942
You wanna talk about it?I don'’t wanna talk about it.

50:33.117 --> 50:35.380
You don'’t wanna
talk about it.
Okay, no, I understand.

50:41.647 --> 50:43.649
I'’m really conflicted about it.You seem conflicted.

50:43.823 --> 50:45.390
I am. I'’m conflicted.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.525
You know what this
reminds me of?

50:50.699 --> 50:52.049
Jakarta.

50:52.223 --> 50:54.921
Jakarta?
Jakarta was a shitfest.

50:56.401 --> 50:57.750
Oh,
it wasn'’t all bad.

51:03.625 --> 51:04.974
Okay, but you
feel conflicted now.

51:05.149 --> 51:07.803
Yes, she'’s...
my friend.

51:07.977 --> 51:09.457
She'’s your best friend.She was my friend.

51:09.631 --> 51:11.068
And then she completely
ditched me and abandoned me

51:11.242 --> 51:12.765
to become
a fucking civilian.

51:12.939 --> 51:14.723
I know. I was like...

51:14.897 --> 51:17.857
Must'’ve had
a pretty good reason for that,
I guess, you know.

51:18.031 --> 51:20.555
Whose side are you on, Tom?You know the answer.

51:20.729 --> 51:22.296
Do I?I hope that you do.

51:22.470 --> 51:25.343
I hope you do.Okay.

51:25.517 --> 51:28.476
I hope that you realize
that this feels like
more of a conversation

51:28.650 --> 51:30.174
than a conflict.Conflict.

51:30.348 --> 51:31.479
Another fucking Gottlieb gem.It'’s a good Gottlieb.

51:31.653 --> 51:33.220
Thanks for that.
I'’m gonna kill her.

51:33.394 --> 51:34.656
I don'’t think you'’re
in the right mindset for this.

51:34.830 --> 51:36.136
I don'’t think killing
should be personal.

51:36.310 --> 51:37.877
It'’s like plumbing.
It'’s just a job.

51:38.051 --> 51:40.445
Okay, well then,
shut up and do your job.
All right, Tom?

51:42.534 --> 51:44.188
Seriously, how long
is this gonna take?

51:44.362 --> 51:45.928
It'’s gonna take
what it'’s gonna take!

51:46.103 --> 51:48.017
Calm down.Calm down, Tom!

51:48.192 --> 51:49.193
Okay.

51:49.932 --> 51:51.108
Are you done?

51:52.196 --> 51:53.675
Uh, hon?

52:02.336 --> 52:03.294
Girls!

52:05.513 --> 52:07.254
God, I hate them.

52:18.961 --> 52:20.833
Oh, shit. Hell no.

52:25.403 --> 52:26.882
Oh, shit!

52:34.499 --> 52:35.761
Hello.

52:39.286 --> 52:40.679
Are you okay?

52:44.813 --> 52:46.293
Can we help you?

52:48.774 --> 52:50.384
Where are you going?

52:54.606 --> 52:56.085
What'’s up, dog?

53:00.438 --> 53:02.266
How'’s it going, Dom?

53:06.226 --> 53:08.794
This is your last chance,
Ray.

53:08.968 --> 53:13.190
You need to go in there
and talk some sense
into that wife of yours.

53:14.452 --> 53:16.280
Think she'’s gonna
listen to me?

53:17.498 --> 53:19.196
You better pray
that she does.

53:53.882 --> 53:56.624
Not exactly the warm
and fuzzy greeting
I was hoping for.

53:57.451 --> 53:58.757
I could have shot you.

53:59.671 --> 54:01.194
What do you want,
Ray?

54:02.282 --> 54:03.370
Dom sent me.

54:05.894 --> 54:07.983
Maybe I should have
shot you.

54:11.509 --> 54:13.250
He wants me to get you
out of here.

54:14.425 --> 54:15.904
Yeah,
I'’m sure he does.

54:17.428 --> 54:18.820
What do you want?

54:21.127 --> 54:24.261
Oh, now you wanna know?

54:25.305 --> 54:26.611
We can take them.

54:28.003 --> 54:30.615
We? We.

54:32.051 --> 54:34.836
You just tell me what you
want me to do, and I'’ll do it.

54:35.010 --> 54:36.098
Fine.

54:38.362 --> 54:39.928
Get out of here.

54:41.582 --> 54:43.018
Ah...

54:43.192 --> 54:44.542
I'’m not leaving.

54:45.978 --> 54:48.676
Ray, please go.

54:53.028 --> 54:56.075
Sixty-five percent.What?

54:56.249 --> 55:00.035
Sixty-five percent
of restaurant staff
quit during their shift.

55:03.648 --> 55:05.606
I'’m not gonna
be one of '’em.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.491
Did they hurt you
out there?

55:23.755 --> 55:26.323
Nothing a stiff drink
won'’t fix.

55:29.151 --> 55:30.675
How about you?

55:31.893 --> 55:34.722
Well, you should see
the other guys.

55:36.724 --> 55:38.247
KGB, huh?

55:39.379 --> 55:40.337
Ex-KGB.

55:40.511 --> 55:42.077
What the fuck?

55:42.991 --> 55:45.167
How the fuck
did we even get here?

55:45.342 --> 55:47.039
A Russki cooking French food.

55:47.213 --> 55:49.346
It'’s crazy.
Doesn'’t make any sense.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.305
I told you.
After I left Russia,
I went to France.

55:52.479 --> 55:53.785
That part is true.

55:54.742 --> 55:56.222
What part isn'’t?

55:58.746 --> 55:59.965
The rest of it.

56:02.663 --> 56:04.839
I'’m still
the same person.

56:07.146 --> 56:10.541
I had no idea
they were gonna try
and torch this place

56:10.715 --> 56:12.369
with you in it.

56:12.543 --> 56:14.022
Doesn'’t matter now.

56:15.241 --> 56:16.895
It matters to me.

56:21.856 --> 56:23.423
So what'’s the plan,
baby?

56:23.597 --> 56:24.816
Well...

56:26.818 --> 56:29.081
I'’ve got
a couple of ideas.

56:31.039 --> 56:32.476
I bet you do.

56:34.086 --> 56:36.915
No! Okay, just wait! Please!

56:37.089 --> 56:38.569
Okay. Okay, look.

56:38.743 --> 56:39.831
I asked God this morning,

56:40.005 --> 56:41.615
I said,
"Send me two strong women."

56:41.789 --> 56:43.487
I don'’t give a fuck
what you asked God
about, Gary.

56:43.661 --> 56:46.968
How did she seem, Gary?I don'’t know!
I don'’t know!

56:47.142 --> 56:48.579
I think you do know,
Gary.Okay.

56:48.753 --> 56:51.625
Okay, she seemed sad.
I don'’t know. Sad.

56:51.799 --> 56:53.366
Honestly, sad.

56:53.540 --> 56:56.717
Sad Anya. Wonderful.
And was she alone?

56:56.891 --> 56:58.676
Well, sh--
Yeah, she was alone.

56:58.850 --> 57:01.505
She whupped all them
grown men ass by herself.

57:01.679 --> 57:03.463
It was embarrassing.Oh,
so she'’s still sharp?

57:03.637 --> 57:05.204
She'’s sharper
than a crackhead'’s toenail.

57:05.378 --> 57:07.032
Honey, cut the guy
some slack.

57:07.206 --> 57:08.903
I wouldn'’t exactly
be a torturer
if I cut him slack.

57:09.077 --> 57:10.514
Listen to him.

57:10.688 --> 57:11.776
You pussy.

57:11.950 --> 57:14.126
Mimi really needs
to get laid.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.475
Okay, okay!

57:15.649 --> 57:17.521
How do you get in?The back door.

57:17.695 --> 57:19.697
What other way
is there to get in?The front door.

57:19.871 --> 57:21.742
Oh, wow, you must be
a fucking architect, Gary.

57:21.916 --> 57:24.702
Not at all. I'’m a masseuse.
I do nothing but massages.

57:24.876 --> 57:26.225
You'’re a masseuse.
Do you fascial work?

57:26.399 --> 57:28.706
Your neck is fine, Tom!
Man up!

57:28.880 --> 57:31.535
I got shrapnel
between my C3 and C4.
I'’m in a lot of pain every day.

57:31.709 --> 57:33.232
Why are there so many cars
parked down there?

57:33.406 --> 57:35.277
I don'’t know!
I don'’t know, lady!

57:35.452 --> 57:37.758
Well, tell me
what you do know, Gary!Bitch, I don'’t know shit!

57:37.932 --> 57:40.282
Okay, I am so sorry
for calling you that.

57:40.457 --> 57:43.547
I-I just don'’t wanna die.I don'’t think
he'’s lying.

57:43.721 --> 57:46.288
I'’m not. I'’m not at all.

57:49.944 --> 57:51.250
Useless.

57:55.080 --> 57:57.256
You'’ll-- She'’s--
Wait, useless?

57:57.430 --> 57:59.998
H-Him or me?
Him-- Him or me?

58:00.868 --> 58:03.610
White people, they so mean.

58:11.749 --> 58:13.141
Yeah, Ray.

58:13.315 --> 58:14.752
Time'’s up, Ray.

58:16.188 --> 58:17.319
All right then.

58:17.494 --> 58:19.234
Then come on out.

58:19.408 --> 58:22.542
Mmm.
That'’s not gonna happen.

58:22.716 --> 58:24.588
Jesus Christ.

58:24.762 --> 58:27.025
Do you got a death wish
or something?

58:27.199 --> 58:29.288
Yeah, something like that. Something like that.

58:29.462 --> 58:33.814
I'’m telling you right now,
this is your last chance.

58:33.988 --> 58:38.384
If you come out right now,
well, you both go free.

58:38.558 --> 58:43.345
But if you keep making me wait,
I'’m gonna put a bullet
in both your heads.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.478
Fucking idiot.

58:45.652 --> 58:48.525
If you kill us,
you won'’t be able to collect
on the insurance money.

58:50.048 --> 58:52.441
Be a shame if you did
all this for nothing.

58:52.616 --> 58:55.140
It'’s not nothing, asshole.

58:55.314 --> 58:56.750
Oh, it'’s something.

58:56.924 --> 58:59.013
What the fuck'’s
wrong with you?

58:59.927 --> 59:01.929
You fucking idiot.

59:04.453 --> 59:06.194
We'’re not coming out, Dom.

59:07.065 --> 59:08.980
If we'’re going down,

59:09.154 --> 59:11.112
we'’re going down swinging.

59:15.464 --> 59:16.814
Then we'’re coming in.

59:32.046 --> 59:33.961
Watch this shit.

59:34.135 --> 59:36.877
They'’re gonna try to
fuck me without even
buying me dinner first.

59:40.228 --> 59:43.971
Let'’s move.

59:44.145 --> 59:45.233
You Dom?

59:46.844 --> 59:47.845
I am.

59:48.019 --> 59:50.151
Good. We'’re here.

59:50.761 --> 59:52.110
I can see that.

59:52.284 --> 59:53.459
No shit.

59:53.633 --> 59:55.069
You spoke to Terry?

59:55.243 --> 59:58.595
I spoke to Terry.We spoke to Terry.

59:58.769 --> 1:00:00.597
And he explained
the overtime rules?

1:00:01.859 --> 1:00:05.253
Yes. Several times. Yes.

1:00:05.427 --> 1:00:07.952
My guys are coming straight
from another job.

1:00:08.126 --> 1:00:09.997
And I appreciate that.

1:00:10.824 --> 1:00:13.348
It means double time.

1:00:15.437 --> 1:00:16.787
So I'’ve heard.

1:00:18.136 --> 1:00:21.748
And if we go
over four hours,
we'’re gonna need lunch.

1:00:27.972 --> 1:00:29.016
Catered.

1:00:34.369 --> 1:00:35.719
Yeah, you got it.

1:00:35.893 --> 1:00:37.851
I want you to kill
that Russian bitch.

1:00:40.724 --> 1:00:43.901
Gary, Gary, Gary,
Gary, Gary.

1:00:44.075 --> 1:00:45.990
Gary, you'’re magic.
You'’re magic.

1:00:46.164 --> 1:00:48.906
No, no, no, no, no.
You don'’t understand.

1:00:49.950 --> 1:00:52.474
Oh, Gary.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:54.738
Oh, Gary.

1:00:54.912 --> 1:00:57.262
You'’re magic. Magic.

1:00:57.436 --> 1:00:58.611
Magic hands.

1:00:58.785 --> 1:01:01.135
Thank you, sir.
That means a lot, Tom.

1:01:01.309 --> 1:01:02.310
I needed this.

1:01:03.268 --> 1:01:05.531
I needed this and I--
and I knew--

1:01:05.705 --> 1:01:08.403
When I saw
those long phalanges, I knew.

1:01:08.577 --> 1:01:09.753
I knew.

1:01:09.927 --> 1:01:12.669
Well,
you seem real stressed.

1:01:15.759 --> 1:01:17.064
Yeah.

1:01:18.587 --> 1:01:19.676
Yeah.

1:01:33.428 --> 1:01:35.474
I used to be happy, Gary.

1:01:41.959 --> 1:01:43.656
Me and Mimi were happy.

1:01:45.571 --> 1:01:46.659
And we...

1:01:50.924 --> 1:01:52.230
we had each other'’s backs.

1:01:52.404 --> 1:01:55.450
She was like, "Thanks, hon.
I got you, babe.

1:02:01.108 --> 1:02:02.327
I got you, babe."

1:02:07.898 --> 1:02:09.682
And then we had kids.

1:02:10.988 --> 1:02:11.989
Hello?

1:02:12.990 --> 1:02:14.513
We can hear you.

1:02:19.126 --> 1:02:20.127
Yeah.

1:02:21.389 --> 1:02:24.392
Me and my ex
had a cat named Blue.

1:02:26.307 --> 1:02:28.614
So I can relate with you.

1:02:32.226 --> 1:02:34.141
I guess it doesn'’t help
that we work together.

1:02:36.796 --> 1:02:38.711
What kind of work
do you do, Tom?

1:02:40.626 --> 1:02:45.022
Well, Gary, I could tell you,
but I might have to kill you.

1:02:53.117 --> 1:02:54.727
I don'’t wanna kill you,
Gary.

1:02:54.901 --> 1:02:57.251
Yeah,
we don'’t want that at all.

1:03:00.254 --> 1:03:02.256
I'’m not gonna kill you,
Gary.

1:03:11.657 --> 1:03:12.745
Thanks, Gary.

1:03:14.703 --> 1:03:16.183
You'’re free to go.

1:03:18.707 --> 1:03:19.839
You sure?

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:22.929
Don'’t wanna wait on Mimi?

1:03:25.366 --> 1:03:26.803
No, I'’m making the call.

1:03:27.847 --> 1:03:29.066
Goodbye, Gary.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.121
I love you girls.

1:03:42.079 --> 1:03:43.994
Tom must be
off his meds again.

1:03:44.168 --> 1:03:45.691
There'’s only two ways in.

1:03:45.865 --> 1:03:48.912
For everyone who'’s gone in,
no one'’s come out.

1:03:49.086 --> 1:03:51.088
Rocco didn'’t
technically go in.

1:03:51.262 --> 1:03:54.265
Yeah, he exploded
in the parking lot.
Thanks, Mick.

1:03:56.702 --> 1:03:59.618
How many are there?Just one.

1:03:59.792 --> 1:04:00.837
Just one?

1:04:01.925 --> 1:04:04.536
One giant
pain in the ass.

1:04:04.710 --> 1:04:07.104
Well, we'’ll hit him
from both sides.

1:04:07.278 --> 1:04:08.583
Her.

1:04:08.757 --> 1:04:11.412
It'’s a her?It'’s a her.

1:04:11.586 --> 1:04:14.241
Huh.
Well, that'’s gonna cost extra.

1:04:16.243 --> 1:04:18.637
You'’re kidding,
right?I'’m not.

1:04:18.811 --> 1:04:21.074
I mean, I thought
you women wanted equality.

1:04:21.248 --> 1:04:23.990
You'’re telling me
we all showed up
for one woman?

1:04:24.164 --> 1:04:26.297
I'’m telling you
I got 10,000 bucks

1:04:26.471 --> 1:04:28.560
for the person who kills
that goddamn Russian.

1:04:28.734 --> 1:04:29.909
We'’re dealing with Russians?

1:04:30.083 --> 1:04:33.086
Technically, Russian.
Just the one. Ana.

1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:35.045
Is that gonna
cost us more?

1:04:35.219 --> 1:04:37.047
Everything costs.

1:04:38.396 --> 1:04:40.311
We'’ve dealt
with Russians before,

1:04:40.485 --> 1:04:42.617
and it'’s not gonna be pretty.

1:04:42.791 --> 1:04:45.142
I don'’t need it
to be pretty.
I need it to be done.

1:04:45.316 --> 1:04:47.535
I'’m gonna need
one of those walkie-talkies...

1:04:50.364 --> 1:04:52.279
for communication purposes.

1:04:52.453 --> 1:04:55.021
Mick,
go wait in the car.

1:04:55.195 --> 1:04:57.110
Adults are talking
over here.

1:04:59.678 --> 1:05:02.072
Go wait
in the fucking car.

1:05:04.726 --> 1:05:05.902
It'’s my kid.

1:05:07.686 --> 1:05:09.601
I'’ll do him
for free.

1:05:12.386 --> 1:05:13.605
Ready?

1:05:15.563 --> 1:05:16.738
Ready.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.305
Na zdorovie.

1:05:19.089 --> 1:05:20.612
Exactly.

1:06:49.179 --> 1:06:51.746
We need backup!
Send in everyone!

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:54.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:06:56.577 --> 1:06:57.448
Get down!

1:07:02.714 --> 1:07:04.368
Get her!

1:07:09.373 --> 1:07:10.939
Table for five?

1:07:13.420 --> 1:07:14.334
No walk-ins.

1:07:19.644 --> 1:07:23.300
Ray, get behind the bar.

1:07:47.454 --> 1:07:49.543
Go, go, go!

1:07:56.507 --> 1:07:57.725
Scatter, scatter!

1:08:10.738 --> 1:08:11.783
You okay?

1:08:15.874 --> 1:08:17.354
I'’m good.

1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:20.139
Hang in there.

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:24.752
Go, go.

1:08:33.718 --> 1:08:35.676
She'’s out of bullets!
Push up!

1:08:35.850 --> 1:08:37.461
She'’s out of ammo!

1:08:39.941 --> 1:08:41.204
Watch your back!

1:08:44.076 --> 1:08:45.121
Go, go, go!

1:08:45.295 --> 1:08:46.818
I love you.

1:08:50.952 --> 1:08:52.519
I love you, shithead.

1:08:58.090 --> 1:08:59.004
Watch out!

1:09:04.357 --> 1:09:06.272
There'’s another one!

1:09:06.446 --> 1:09:07.708
Where the hell is--

1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:13.497
What Chardonnays do you have?

1:09:13.671 --> 1:09:16.369
I like something
a little fruity.

1:09:16.543 --> 1:09:17.805
Trust me.

1:09:23.202 --> 1:09:24.725
Whoo!

1:09:24.899 --> 1:09:26.379
I mean, it can be pinot.

1:09:26.553 --> 1:09:28.860
I really don'’t care what it is.
I'’m not picky.

1:09:32.168 --> 1:09:35.997
Mimi, you made it.

1:09:36.172 --> 1:09:37.564
Looks like
I was just in time.

1:09:43.570 --> 1:09:45.224
Thanks, hon!

1:09:47.444 --> 1:09:48.488
I got you, babe.

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:52.275
I missed you,
Anya.

1:09:52.449 --> 1:09:55.843
Oh, I missed you too.
It'’s been so long.

1:09:56.017 --> 1:09:58.150
Oh, I know. Too long.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:00.718
Thanks for coming.

1:10:00.892 --> 1:10:03.764
Me, miss an opportunity
to catch up with an old friend?

1:10:03.938 --> 1:10:05.462
I would never.

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:09.988
I'’ve been looking for you
all these years.

1:10:10.641 --> 1:10:12.512
Really?

1:10:12.686 --> 1:10:16.168
I mean, that'’s what you do
when a friend just up
and vanishes.

1:10:16.342 --> 1:10:19.780
You literally disappeared
without a trace.

1:10:19.954 --> 1:10:21.478
I remember. Yeah, I know.

1:10:21.652 --> 1:10:25.830
I think you owe me
a bit of an explanation.

1:10:27.832 --> 1:10:31.270
Oh, come on, Mimi.
It'’s been such
a long time ago. I--

1:10:34.273 --> 1:10:36.014
I don'’t think you understand

1:10:36.188 --> 1:10:40.410
quite how upset
some of our friends were
when you left.

1:10:43.717 --> 1:10:45.241
I'’m sorry.

1:10:48.853 --> 1:10:50.028
You'’re sorry?

1:10:51.682 --> 1:10:53.074
I'’m sorry.

1:10:54.859 --> 1:10:57.383
Okay, well, then water
under the bridge, right?

1:10:57.557 --> 1:10:59.777
Sure, I mean--Wrong.

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:07.088
Mimi, come on.Anya.

1:11:10.962 --> 1:11:12.355
All right.

1:11:12.529 --> 1:11:15.271
Okay, so now what?

1:11:18.056 --> 1:11:20.058
Well, now I kill you,
sweetie.

1:11:31.417 --> 1:11:33.506
They blamed me for leaving!

1:11:35.639 --> 1:11:37.467
You'’re rusty.

1:11:41.601 --> 1:11:43.995
You think I didn'’t think
about leaving, huh?

1:11:44.169 --> 1:11:46.345
You could have told me!

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:50.480
Mimi, I tried to protect you.

1:11:57.356 --> 1:11:59.315
But I never would'’ve left
without you.

1:12:04.058 --> 1:12:06.409
Oh, I'’ve waited
years for this.

1:12:15.766 --> 1:12:18.334
I made a mistake, Mimi.
I'’m sorry.

1:12:18.508 --> 1:12:21.075
Aw. Not sorry enough, baby.

1:12:32.217 --> 1:12:34.175
I never meant to hurt you.

1:12:51.410 --> 1:12:54.108
Friends don'’t
abandon each other.

1:13:12.779 --> 1:13:14.999
You left me
without cover in Paris.

1:13:15.173 --> 1:13:16.435
You had Tom.

1:13:16.609 --> 1:13:18.132
Tom'’s a moron!

1:13:38.892 --> 1:13:41.242
At least your husband
didn'’t gamble away
your dreams.

1:13:41.417 --> 1:13:43.157
What are you talking about?

1:13:44.332 --> 1:13:46.683
Husbands are more trouble
than they'’re worth.

1:13:46.857 --> 1:13:48.815
Yeah, tell me about it.

1:13:52.384 --> 1:13:55.213
I made a mistake, Mimi.

1:13:55.953 --> 1:13:58.695
Yeah, you really did.

1:14:01.262 --> 1:14:03.395
You were my family.

1:14:10.663 --> 1:14:13.057
And you'’re still
my fucking family.

1:14:21.544 --> 1:14:24.024
I don'’t believe we'’ve been
properly introduced.

1:14:30.683 --> 1:14:34.252
Oh, he'’s tougher
than he looks.

1:14:35.514 --> 1:14:36.733
Thanks, hon.

1:14:37.995 --> 1:14:41.172
Well, he looks geriatric.
I hope so.

1:14:41.346 --> 1:14:43.087
Yeah, I'’m an old man...

1:14:44.305 --> 1:14:46.960
with a double-barrel shotgun
aimed at your head.

1:14:48.527 --> 1:14:49.615
I'’m Mimi.

1:14:51.095 --> 1:14:52.705
An old friend of Ana'’s.

1:14:54.620 --> 1:14:56.840
How about you put
that gun down, friendo?

1:14:58.494 --> 1:14:59.886
Maybe he'’s not all bad.

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.628
He'’s got his moments.

1:15:08.895 --> 1:15:10.462
I really miss you, Anya.

1:15:12.029 --> 1:15:13.900
I miss you too, Mimi.

1:15:25.042 --> 1:15:28.088
Well,
that was fun.

1:15:29.612 --> 1:15:31.222
We should go
to dinner sometime.

1:15:31.396 --> 1:15:33.833
Do a proper catch-up,
leave the boys at home.

1:15:34.660 --> 1:15:35.618
Sure thing.

1:15:37.533 --> 1:15:39.273

1:15:39.447 --> 1:15:41.537
Don'’t be such a stranger.

I'’m getting soft.

1:16:34.024 --> 1:16:35.634
Where'’s the hostage?

1:16:37.288 --> 1:16:39.595
I let him go.You what?

1:16:43.294 --> 1:16:44.425

a lot more often.

Not in front of the girls.

1:17:00.877 --> 1:17:02.052
Come here.

1:18:04.114 --> 1:18:05.158
Hmm.

1:18:08.118 --> 1:18:10.076
Ten Gs down the toilet.

1:18:11.774 --> 1:18:13.689
