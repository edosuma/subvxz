21:02.266 --> 21:05.266
I just had to know.

21:05.402 --> 21:10.727
And I thought maybe if I came out here,
something would come to me, you know?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.128
Some memory.

21:13.844 --> 21:15.978
Kari was searching for answers.

21:15.979 --> 21:19.839
I did not know how to go and
tell her in a respectful way...

21:19.840 --> 21:25.360
That I had been seeing her
little brother in my house.

21:28.459 --> 21:30.927
Back in 1967...

21:30.928 --> 21:34.882
My parents were having a hard
time with their relationship,

21:34.883 --> 21:38.423
and raising five kids, so...

21:40.671 --> 21:44.571
We were placed in foster homes...

21:47.311 --> 21:50.071
At their request.

21:50.260 --> 21:53.249
My older sister and brother...

21:53.250 --> 21:58.255
They went into one foster home, and
me and Kris went into a different one.

21:58.256 --> 22:01.825
Kris, it's okay.
Everything's going to be fine.

22:01.826 --> 22:07.726
I was really close to Kris while
I was living here because...

22:07.877 --> 22:12.126
Well, me and him were
the only thing we knew.

22:12.127 --> 22:16.927
My brother and I, we
slept in the same bed.

22:21.813 --> 22:26.193
And we were really close to each other.

22:27.985 --> 22:32.485
I remember one day, Kris wasn't with me.

22:34.090 --> 22:36.892
I went to look for him...

22:36.893 --> 22:40.162
Can I look at the hallway?

22:40.163 --> 22:42.863
Yeah, of course.

22:50.575 --> 22:54.415
As I walked through the house...

22:57.615 --> 23:00.435
I saw the spot...

23:02.320 --> 23:04.240
Kris?

23:06.624 --> 23:10.524
Where I found Kris on the floor.

23:11.111 --> 23:15.731
His eyes were open,
and he wasn't moving.

23:19.436 --> 23:21.938
I was saying, come on, Kris.

23:21.939 --> 23:24.656
Wake up. Let's go play.

23:24.657 --> 23:29.097
But I didn't know what happened to him.

23:31.615 --> 23:34.495
I looked at him...

23:34.631 --> 23:37.571
And I didn't know.

23:45.098 --> 23:47.078
[Sobs]

23:47.764 --> 23:51.784
They told me it was all my fault.

It was just so sad...

23:54.437 --> 23:55.561
[Sobbing]

23:55.562 --> 24:01.462
Because she thought she was
responsible for her brother's death.

24:13.557 --> 24:14.757
There you go.

24:14.758 --> 24:17.038
Thank you.

24:18.362 --> 24:23.282
I wanted to tell Kari
what I was experiencing.

24:23.901 --> 24:25.011
And she said...

24:25.012 --> 24:28.002
You would not believe
some of the things...

24:28.003 --> 24:31.073
That have happened in this house.

24:31.074 --> 24:35.878
I've seen a little boy
running through the hallway.

24:35.879 --> 24:38.933
[Whispers] Oh, my God.

24:38.934 --> 24:40.950
My son...

24:40.951 --> 24:43.152
Heard a child upstairs.

24:43.153 --> 24:45.354
And she said...

24:45.355 --> 24:48.891
I think I may have seen
your little brother.

24:48.892 --> 24:50.798
Are you serious?

24:50.799 --> 24:54.790
I was trying to look at her to
see, is she telling me the truth?

24:54.791 --> 24:59.891
I know I saw a little
blond boy in the hallway.

24:59.903 --> 25:02.538
I couldn't believe it.

25:02.539 --> 25:03.657
And you think it's him.

25:03.658 --> 25:06.220
My mind was just...

25:06.221 --> 25:10.647
Blown away at the things
that she was telling me.

25:10.648 --> 25:16.548
It was just so bizarre how our stories
were just so entwined, you know...

25:17.421 --> 25:20.110
Without even knowing each other.

25:20.111 --> 25:22.668
Why would he be here?

25:22.669 --> 25:27.049
I couldn't put it together in my mind.

25:28.948 --> 25:32.769
It was hard saying good-bye to Kari...

25:32.770 --> 25:35.994
Seeing her leave so emotional.

25:35.995 --> 25:37.773
It was really nice meeting you.

25:37.774 --> 25:39.934
You too.

25:47.783 --> 25:51.601
I wanted to know how
he died and why he died.

25:51.602 --> 25:55.442
Because children don't just die.

26:02.064 --> 26:04.800
After being in the foster home,

26:04.801 --> 26:08.603
when I was 16, I had gotten
into an argument with my mom.

26:08.604 --> 26:13.541
In the heat of the moment, she
said, you killed your brother.

26:13.542 --> 26:14.554
Just like that.

26:14.555 --> 26:19.115
And that was the end
of the conversation.

26:23.819 --> 26:26.858
And I was devastated.

26:26.859 --> 26:31.526
Wondering if I was
the cause of his death.

26:31.527 --> 26:33.829
I needed to know more.

26:33.830 --> 26:38.870
I thought, maybe I had
something to do with it.

26:40.903 --> 26:44.373
It said in the article that...

26:44.374 --> 26:48.934
That he died from
strenuous child's play.

26:50.246 --> 26:55.016
And that just freaked me out,
because I thought, oh, my God.

26:55.017 --> 26:58.419
Maybe I hurt him somehow on accident.

26:58.420 --> 27:04.180
I started looking at the autopsy
reports and police report.

27:04.261 --> 27:06.481
To try to piece it together.

27:06.482 --> 27:11.822
And there were a lot of
things that didn't connect.

27:14.003 --> 27:17.329
The foster father told
the police and the doctors

27:17.330 --> 27:22.834
that he found Kris upstairs in the
bedrooms with us, and he wasn't breathing.

27:22.835 --> 27:26.750

I remember where I found him.

doing out on the lawn?

- There's somebody in the house.

having a paranormal team come in.

he was upstairs when he heard it?

- We showed them all the hot spots.

and then I followed him into here...

Kris' injuries were
not caused by a child.

41:22.193 --> 41:25.853

He was murdered.

little boy went through...

42:08.013 --> 42:10.833

in my home for 45 years...

Being tormented by that man...

42:19.263 --> 42:21.903
Is even harder.
