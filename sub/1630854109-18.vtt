WEBVTT

00:43.010 --> 00:44.412
Aah!

00:58.392 --> 01:00.027
I'm afraid you're wasting your
time, Special Agent Tennant.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.062
I asked HQ if you could
take him for questioning.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.165
They said no,
they had to get on a plane

01:04.265 --> 01:05.466
back to the mainland ASAP.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.900
Laird Harriman is responsible

01:07.000 --> 01:10.070
for the death of an
NCSI undercover agent.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.073
Look, I wish I
could help, but...
The body was never found.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.411
Look, if you just let
me talk to Harriman,

01:17.511 --> 01:19.247
I know I can get him
to give me something.

01:19.347 --> 01:23.151
The agent's family deserves
to know what happened.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.785
What was your guy's name?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.555
Craig Anton.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.191
He'd been on the job
for only two years.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.194
I met him at JCITA.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.864
He used to call me once
a month to ask advice about...

01:36.964 --> 01:39.700
whatever he didn't
quite understand yet.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.237
We all need someone like you
when we start out.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.211
The helicopter to O'ahu
takes an hour.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.012
Why don't you ride with us?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.548
Thank you, Agent Crichton.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.588
All right, I'm going to pick
Tennant up at Barbers Point.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.523
Yeah? She take a helo
joyride up the coast?

02:02.623 --> 02:05.058
No, she went to Maui to
interrogate a suspect.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.527
And according to her text,

02:06.627 --> 02:08.729
she's doing it as they
transport him back to O'ahu.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.898
Who is it?
I don't know.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.533
Laird Harriman.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.568
What is: name of the villain

02:14.668 --> 02:16.870
in the new streaming series
you're watching?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.508
No, it's the name of the person
Tennant's interrogating.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.709
That ring a bell to you?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.577
Nope.
She thinks he murdered

02:23.677 --> 02:26.980
an undercover NCIS agent
from the Northwest Field Office.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.817
Case is unsolved. I helped her
pull the files together.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.786
She ever work in that office?
Not that I know of.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.922
Then what's her
connection to the case?

02:35.022 --> 02:36.757
I don't know.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.025
She mentioned a couple of times

02:38.125 --> 02:39.393
that the agent's body
was never found.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.862
Ah.
"Ah" what?

02:41.962 --> 02:44.164
Tennant's the mariny-est
"never-been-a-marine"

02:44.265 --> 02:45.165
I've ever met.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.535
True.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.136
You have no idea
what he's talking about.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.137
None.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.939
"No man left behind."

02:52.039 --> 02:54.308
Tennant must have a connection
to the agent in Seattle.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.878
He's missing, the body needs
to be found and brought home.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.881
Well, if this prisoner knows,
she'll find out.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.116
No one's better at getting you
to spill secrets

03:03.217 --> 03:04.452
than Jane Tennant.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.589
I had planned to take my Lacy
Zimmerman story to the grave.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.026
Bye, guys.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.436
We know you were meeting
with Agent Anton.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.904
He tell you that?

03:24.004 --> 03:27.140
It was in his notes
that he left on his desk.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.376
Look, if you didn't

03:28.476 --> 03:29.643
have anything
to do with

03:29.743 --> 03:31.445
his disappearance,
then just tell me

03:31.545 --> 03:32.980
what you do know about it.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.551
Nothing.
But you met with him.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.786
Where was he headed next?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.988
I didn't say I met with him.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.492
But we both know you did.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.727
Look, agents keep notes
for a reason.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.263
To document the facts
of their cases.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.699
They're only facts
if you can prove them.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.402
Okay. Look, I understand
why you think

03:54.502 --> 03:55.969
you're in the driver's seat.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.906
You've been suspected of a lot
and convicted of nothing.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.575
Maybe because I'm innocent.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.012
Isn't that how
the legal system works?

04:05.112 --> 04:06.314
This is different.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.116
You've actually been
arrested this time.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.418
How many federal charges

04:10.518 --> 04:12.052
is Mr. Harriman facing,
Agent Crichton?

04:12.152 --> 04:13.086
Six, ma'am.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.322
Six.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.089
If you're convicted
of all of them,

04:16.189 --> 04:17.858
that's 50, 60 years.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.960
If you're only convicted
of one, that's ten years.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.364
So, best case, you're looking
at hard five years.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.666
Or I walk.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.868
I've seen your case file.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.570
You can't afford
a lawyer good enough

04:29.670 --> 04:31.439
to get you off clean.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.442
Let me help you make a deal.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.577
In exchange for your
cooperation w...

04:36.677 --> 04:38.912
Let me...

04:39.747 --> 04:40.914
Go in the med bag and empty out

04:41.014 --> 04:43.050
the saline syringe.
What's happening?

04:44.385 --> 04:45.686
When we put him in holding
before the transfer,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.020
he said he
was diabetic.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.990
I've never seen a diabetic
seize like this.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.425
It's not my job to diagnose him.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.626
Hand me your
orange juice.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.432
It's not working.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.601
Let's turn him
on his back.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.237
Don't do that! Don't do that!

05:07.675 --> 05:09.276
Prisoner's loose!

05:09.377 --> 05:10.310
What?

05:10.411 --> 05:13.614
Gun?
No!

05:32.032 --> 05:34.267
Must have gotten
my times wrong.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.904
You mind checking
their ETA?
Mm-hmm.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.709
Crichton!

05:41.809 --> 05:43.811
Buckle up,
buckle up!

06:02.029 --> 06:05.999
Okay, Janie, this will
only hurt a medium amount.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.802
Maybe a medium-to-large amount.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.571
Are you sure it won't
hurt just a little?

06:10.671 --> 06:13.507
Well, we won't know
until we do it.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.876
You ready?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.848
Medium.
Medium.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.216
How'd you hurt yourself?

06:23.316 --> 06:25.352
I jumped off the moving van

06:25.453 --> 06:27.421
and I fell.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.423
What were you doing
on the moving van?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.825
Looking for Mommy's stuff.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.729
Mommy's not coming
stateside with us.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.598
You know that.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.867
Well, how do we know?

06:41.368 --> 06:43.471
She told me.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.506
But she didn't
come say goodbye.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.074
How can we be sure?

06:47.174 --> 06:48.676
I'm sure, Janie.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.211
We both know

06:51.311 --> 06:54.147
that your mom has a hard time

06:54.247 --> 06:58.351
finding the right words
to describe what she's feeling.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.555
And I think that...

07:02.990 --> 07:05.859
...that she doesn't
want to use the wrong ones.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.061
Which is why she asked me
to talk to you.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.964
When do you think
she'll find the right words?

07:13.901 --> 07:14.802
I don't know.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.070
I wouldn't have left her.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.405
I know you wouldn't have.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.941
But not everyone's like you.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.510
Come here.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.427
Agent Crichton.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.195
Agent Crichton, we got
to get out of here.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.398
Go help the copilot.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.308
Sir.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.410
We have to go.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.747
Let's go.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.382
Get him to the trees.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.552
I got you.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.221
All right.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.291
All right, stay here.
Be right back.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.466
You got a cell phone?
Yeah.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.269
Okay, put pressure.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.771
There's... there's no service.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.539
Okay, walk around, see if
you can get some bars.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.874
Tell them that our
helicopter crashed,

08:26.974 --> 08:28.341
one U.S. marshal's dead,

08:28.441 --> 08:29.777
Harriman escaped

08:29.877 --> 08:31.679
and that he is definitely armed. No,

08:31.779 --> 08:33.280
he-he dropped that gun.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.616
I saw it under one of the seats.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.818
Yeah, well, he got another one.
How do you know?

08:44.491 --> 08:45.893
Till about five minutes ago,

08:45.993 --> 08:47.728
the transponder was
sending out a steady signal

08:47.828 --> 08:50.564
southeast to southwest
over Moloka'i

08:50.664 --> 08:53.166
at about 140 miles per hour.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.135
For a minute before
the signal disappeared,

08:55.235 --> 08:56.804
it was basically stationary.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.171
They crashed.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.540
It's a logical conclusion.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.109
Hey. I called Whistler.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.477
She's requisitioned one
of the FBI's helicopters,

09:04.578 --> 09:06.814
so I'm gonna meet her,
we'll head to the site.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.682
Marshals are also
dispatching a team.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.317
Swing by and pick me up.
No, we need you

09:10.417 --> 09:12.519
to come back to the office
and be the boss.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.922
While we look for the boss.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.858
If it's a crash,
then there's no reason to...

09:17.958 --> 09:19.392
We don't actually know
what happened, Jesse.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.428
Maybe a crash.
Maybe a forced landing,

09:21.528 --> 09:23.430
a hijacking,
a short stop for lunch.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.133
Yeah, well, it's definitely
not the last one.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.534
But I get your point.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.202
I'll come back to Pearl.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.771
Kai, call me when you have eyes.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.106
Ernie, go to the war room,
set us up a command center

09:33.206 --> 09:35.508
and coordinate with the
joint base emergency manager.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.110
On it, boss junior.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.779
And Ernie--

09:38.879 --> 09:41.448
have them dispatch
an extra medical transport.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.850
It was a prisoner transfer.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.152
There's at least
five people onboard.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.787
One bus might not be enough.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.824
All right,
well, we're late arriving,

09:50.924 --> 09:53.160
so people are already
looking for us.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.562
When they get here,
tell them the pilot

09:55.663 --> 09:57.931
is in and out of consciousness

09:58.031 --> 10:00.267
and that he has a gunshot wound
in his right thigh.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.268
Where you going?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.836
After Harriman.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.472
I'm coming with you.
There's no need for that.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.808
He's my prisoner.
True, but if I didn't

10:07.908 --> 10:09.943
press him about that murder,
he might have been content

10:10.043 --> 10:11.879
seeing what a good lawyer
can get him.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.048
So there's an argument to be had
that I got you into this mess.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.149
Still.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.152
Okay.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.026
When the rescuers get here,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
tell them about
your friend's condition.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.097
I have to go find him.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.737
I doubt that he will circle
back around to the helicopter,

10:36.837 --> 10:40.007
but if he does,
you know what to do, right?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.075
Yeah.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.510
Okay.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.714
Hey. Nice job getting
us down safely.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.688
Um, pretty sure
we crashed.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.456
Yeah, well, sometimes, kindness

10:56.556 --> 10:59.592
is more effective than honesty.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.430
According to the marshals,
the pilots are experienced.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.566
The helicopter itself had
no previous mechanical issues.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.501
<i>Okay.</i>

11:08.601 --> 11:10.337
Well, we're about
15 minutes from the site.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.571
We'll know more then.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.073
Special Agent Curtis
called ahead

11:13.173 --> 11:14.908
to Queen's Medical.
The trauma unit is on alert.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.143
All right. Thanks, Whistler.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.145
I'll make sure anyone who...

11:18.245 --> 11:20.413
you know, needs to be
transported is sent there.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.015
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.817
So, equipment
in good working order,

11:23.917 --> 11:27.620
fair weather-- you're not
thinking this was an accident?

11:27.721 --> 11:29.122
Prisoner transfer.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.091
One important enough
for Tennant to be a part of.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.126
I guess I didn't want
to assume anything.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.527
Is there something
I can help you with?

11:34.627 --> 11:35.996
I heard Tennant was in trouble.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.965
Thought maybe there was
something I could do.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.467
No bodies yet, Commander Chase.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.802
That's not what I meant.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.804
Tennant had me make some calls,

11:43.904 --> 11:45.672
see if that missing agent's
body had been misidentified

11:45.773 --> 11:47.841
by any medical examiners.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.476
I read this case file.

11:49.576 --> 11:52.312
That prisoner is not someone
who will go to jail easily.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.748
Tell me what you know.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.218
What's Harriman's
plan, anyway?

11:58.318 --> 12:00.487
Other than not going to prison?

12:00.587 --> 12:01.989
Don't think he really
thought it through.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.656
Does he really think
he'll escape?

12:03.757 --> 12:06.259
He crashed a helicopter.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.996
He's motivated, if nothing else.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.965
Which means he will be
extremely dangerous.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.671
Thanks, Agent Tennant.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.041
That was really close.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.588
Okay.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.590
How you doing?

13:10.690 --> 13:13.726
I don't know. I hurt everywhere.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.129
Shh.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.833
Aah!

13:38.451 --> 13:41.254
The copilot says
the prisoner caused the crash

13:41.354 --> 13:43.190
and that Tennant and a marshal
named Sam Crichton

13:43.290 --> 13:44.257
headed off after him.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.292
How long ago?

13:45.392 --> 13:46.593
30, 40 minutes.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.495
What direction from the crash?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.696
East.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.234
A combination
of trees and open fields.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.137
No houses or roads
for at least six miles.
All right,

13:57.237 --> 14:00.307
Kai, you and Whistler
go off on their presumed route.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.276
Just a random walk
through choice space?

14:04.077 --> 14:06.346
How did you do
on combat hunter training, Kai?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.315
Number one in my class of 200.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.518
So, not so random.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.520
I'll send a couple
of helicopters

14:13.620 --> 14:16.189
in that specific
search area as well.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.959
Hey. I heard about Tennant.
Not sure why,

14:19.059 --> 14:22.495
but... I do feel a lot better
now that Boom-Boom's there.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.763
BOOM-BOOM:
Thanks, Holman.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.965
All right, we'll let you know

14:25.065 --> 14:26.599
when we find anything.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.002
What can I do?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.303
Uh, well, other
than offer

14:30.403 --> 14:31.671
moral support to Kai,
I'm not sure that

14:31.771 --> 14:33.273
there's much
to do here at Pearl.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.674
I disagree.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.809
Knowing more about Harriman
can only help.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.346
It might give us a sense
of what he's gonna do next

14:39.446 --> 14:42.415
or maybe even help us
find him before he can...

14:45.785 --> 14:51.158
Boom-Boom, I'm giving you access
to my office and computers.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.061
The Harriman files are in a
folder labeled "Harriman Files."

14:54.161 --> 14:55.695
I keep my snacks
in the bottom drawer

14:55.795 --> 14:57.330
of the cabinet
labeled "Top Secret."

14:57.430 --> 15:00.968
Okay, well, I like
to spread out when I work.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.069
Well, feel free.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.836
And you take up a lot of space.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.438
I won't be there.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.974
I'm going to
Tennant's house.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.577
Oh. I think you
should focus on

15:10.677 --> 15:13.113
any other crimes
Harriman was involved in,

15:13.213 --> 15:15.082
so we can see
any predictive patterns.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.584
Got it.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.952
Ernie.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.353
Why Tennant's house?

15:20.453 --> 15:21.888
Are you thinking about
talking to the kids?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.256
It's too soon.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.325
Well, to tell Julie.
But she's on a school trip.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.227
Alex is the only one home.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.529
He's old enough
to know what's going on.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.231
And he might even
know something helpful.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.832
You know, he's a little nosy.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.768
Dude, really? How can you
eat during a time like this?

15:35.868 --> 15:38.505
Can't think straight
if your blood sugar drops.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.273
There's tuna salad
in the fridge.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.410
He's weird, but he's right.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.016
All right, so I have this
extra gauze in my pocket

15:49.116 --> 15:50.450
from taking care of the pilot.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.852
but don't give me
any extra points.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.755
I do not have "another gunshot"
on my bingo card.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.992
Should we move further away

15:59.092 --> 16:00.793
from that hole to the surface?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.395
By my count,

16:02.495 --> 16:05.032
he's fired six rounds.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.866
So is your Glock
a 22 or a 27?

16:06.966 --> 16:07.867
27.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.103
He's got four left.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.472
He's gonna need to save those
for the people chasing him.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.342
We're gonna put this in here.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.945
I need you to put pressure here.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.481
Aah...

16:22.315 --> 16:23.883
All right, where else you hurt?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.718
I'm fine.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.220
You are not fine.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.322
I fell from that same distance
and I hurt like hell.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.891
You need to get yourself
out of here.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
I need to get us both
out of here.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.434
Those glasses make you look
like the old lady

16:41.534 --> 16:42.835
in the ad for the fizzy tablets.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.172
Your grandmother
give them to you?

16:45.272 --> 16:46.873
Okay, that

16:46.973 --> 16:49.109
does not help. Now we can
actually see your face.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.210
Shut up, Howie.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.278
You shut up, Jane.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.479
You're only picking on Dottie

16:52.579 --> 16:53.546
because of your
own insecurities.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.981
I'm telling you to back off.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.483
Or what?
You're gonna hit me?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.751
I can't hit you. You're a girl.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.987
That's not why you won't
hit me. You're afraid.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.555
I'm not getting in trouble
for fighting with

17:02.655 --> 17:03.756
someone as stupid as you.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.892
Okay. I understand.

17:06.793 --> 17:10.263
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Leave her alone.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.864
Fight! Fight! Fight!
What's going on?

17:11.964 --> 17:12.832
What's going on?

17:12.932 --> 17:14.134
She started it.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.535
Well, he was picking on Dottie.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.769
Tell the principal when
we get to school,

17:16.869 --> 17:17.970
see if he cares.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.906
Well, somebody
had to do something.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.708
Not on my bus.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.052
I'm getting a strong David
Copperfield vibe over here.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.289
Traveling by helicopter,
you have to be resourceful.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.459
Never know when the weather's
gonna force you down.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.929
Weather. Crazy prisoner.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.297
Effects seem the same.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.966
Should we be
shouting or something?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.968
They have to know that
we're down at this point.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.370
Definitely.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.439
But there's no telling
where they're searching

17:52.539 --> 17:54.807
and I don't want you
wasting energy shouting.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.042
So what do we do?

17:56.143 --> 18:00.213
I get you taken care of.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.215
I figure out how to go for help.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.651
I saw you fall.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.154
Climbing up that wall
is gonna be impossible.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.522
Maybe.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.224
But somebody's
got to do something.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.992
And between the two of us,

18:13.092 --> 18:16.596
today I'm thinking
that's got to be me.

18:16.696 --> 18:20.500
There's multiple tracks
running through here.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.303
Then someone walks that way.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.871
Someone?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.473
Ah, it's...

18:26.573 --> 18:29.342
it's hard to tell
how many, exactly, uh...

18:29.442 --> 18:32.312
Recent rain
has obscured the prints.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.547
Well, we haven't
found any bodies.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.549
No, so... so we assume Tennant

18:36.649 --> 18:38.418
and the marshal
are following, right?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.620
And...

18:42.322 --> 18:45.358
It is possible one or the other
of them peeled off earlier

18:45.458 --> 18:47.294
and I just missed it.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.563
Wait, there's a campsite
not too far away.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.132
Maybe he crashed the helicopter
close to it because

18:53.233 --> 18:55.368
he's meeting someone.
I mean, even if not,

18:55.468 --> 18:56.503
it's a good place
to steal food and gear

18:56.603 --> 18:57.770
so he could stay hidden.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.138
Crashing a helicopter
is a strange way

18:59.239 --> 19:01.140
to get to a rendezvous.
Maybe the crash

19:01.241 --> 19:03.310
was an unintended consequence.

19:04.110 --> 19:07.113
Of trying to force
the helicopter to the ground.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.148
Maybe.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.520
Place of thieves.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.190
Place of thieves.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.393
I feel like we're playing
a weird game I don't understand.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.862
Moloka'i was a hideout for
criminals for hundreds of years.

19:22.962 --> 19:26.499
It's... it's an easy place
to get lost.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.637
Which way is the campsite?

19:31.771 --> 19:33.172
It's that way.
That way.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.774
Yeah.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.578
Alex.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.181
Alex!

19:42.282 --> 19:43.883
Hey, what's wrong?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.018
Okay, um...

19:47.119 --> 19:48.521
There's a situation.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.291
Let me just
start off by saying

19:51.391 --> 19:53.059
I don't really know anything.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.127
The bottom line is your mom
was on a helicopter

19:55.228 --> 19:56.663
coming back from Maui...

19:57.497 --> 19:58.865
...when it crashed.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.200
H-How could you
not know anything?

20:01.301 --> 20:04.404
You just... you just go
to the helicopter and help her.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.807
We obviously have people there,
but she wasn't there.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.476
She walked away on her own power

20:09.576 --> 20:11.744
and now we're looking for her.

20:11.844 --> 20:12.912
Should we go help?

20:13.012 --> 20:14.847
I think we'll be more help here.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.986
Why are you here?

20:22.955 --> 20:25.057
Well, I think
you're old enough to know.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.127
But I also think
you're young enough

20:28.227 --> 20:30.162
to maybe have someone
sit with you

20:30.263 --> 20:32.265
while we find answers.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.666
Just in case?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.202
Oh, I'm not just-in-casing.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.138
Just here if you need me.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.040
Okay?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.717
Can I at least
make you a sandwich?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.419
Oh, thanks, I'm good.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.420
No, it's fine.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.554
I need to do something,

20:54.654 --> 20:56.523
not just look at you and worry.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.491
Okay.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.226
A sandwich would be great.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.134
Is this the way you thought
the job would be

21:08.234 --> 21:09.902
when you moved to the FBI?

21:10.002 --> 21:11.237
I guess.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.472
I've seen cop shows.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.107
It's not quite the same,
though, right?

21:15.207 --> 21:16.609
No.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.178
It hurts your body a lot more
when you get punched.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.180
Hurts your heart a lot more

21:21.280 --> 21:22.915
when people you care about
get punched.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.485
I would tell you
you get used to it, but...

21:25.585 --> 21:26.653
You're bad at lying.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.521
No, I'm a good liar.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.523
Just not to people
I actually like.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.058
Kai.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.727
Yeah?
Three o'clock.
I think that guy's

21:34.827 --> 21:35.962
pulling that woman away.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.364
They're certainly
moving at a pace.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.565
Is that Harriman?

21:38.665 --> 21:40.333
Height and hair
match, but...

21:40.433 --> 21:43.235
tall and balding don't exactly
make for a positive ID.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.204
That's definitely not Tennant.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.773
But if that is Harriman,

21:46.873 --> 21:49.676
looks like he's
got a hostage. Hey.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.344
Why don't you get as close
behind them as you can

21:51.444 --> 21:52.945
without making him nervous.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.581
What are you gonna do?

21:54.681 --> 21:56.282
Go around then come back
in front of him.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.617
Hey, I...
Thin blonde girl

21:57.717 --> 21:59.352
is way less threatening
than handsome big guy.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.687
Fair enough.

22:00.787 --> 22:01.954
Okay. See you.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.089
Okay.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.565
Hey!

22:12.665 --> 22:13.633
Lovely day, isn't it?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.267
Um, do you know how far the...

22:21.273 --> 22:22.709
Hey!

22:24.644 --> 22:25.978
Kate.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.847
Kate.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.824
Units en route.
Copy. Head back to the campsite.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.626
Agents are coming this way
to help you.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.428
Where's Harriman?

22:41.528 --> 22:42.929
He went that way, into cover.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.298
But, hey, thanks to you,
his hostage is safe.

22:46.399 --> 22:47.700
Why did he grab her?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.168
They were headed to her car
at the trailhead.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.004
So he wasn't meeting anyone. No.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.106
He still needs to find
a way out of the woods.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.107
Yeah.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.343
Hey, I've called for backup.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.579
Medical team is on its way
to help you, okay?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.581
No, I-I'm coming with you.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.850
No. You just...
you got punched you in the face.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.885
You need to stay here
and let them take a look at you.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.454
Kai, I'm fine.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.488
How can you be sure?

23:08.588 --> 23:09.756
Well, I played field hockey.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.290
So I know what
a concussion feels like.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.359
Hey. Stop. Whistler...
Hey, we're wasting time.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.227
Tennant wasn't with him, so...

23:16.028 --> 23:20.066
She's either still out there
searching for him or...

23:20.166 --> 23:22.234
...or he left her someplace
and we need to know where.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.504
Yeah.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.138
So are you planning
to tie me to a tree?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.440
No.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.842
All right, then let's go.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.982
Here you go. Thanks.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.317
You should give me an update.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.220
Well, there's not much
to report.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.389
Well, you haven't
told me anything except

23:43.490 --> 23:45.892
my mom was involved
in a helicopter crash

23:45.992 --> 23:48.227
and now she's MIA, so...

23:48.327 --> 23:50.296
anything would be something.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.600
Well, the facts of why
she's on the helicopter,

23:53.700 --> 23:56.803
how it crashed and what she's
doing now don't really matter.

23:57.737 --> 24:01.541
What matters is that
she's incredible.

24:01.641 --> 24:05.077
And all the people looking
for her are smart and dedicated

24:05.177 --> 24:09.816
and doing everything they can
to find her and bring her home.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.183
But she could die.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.820
There's-there's no way
for me to... Look,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.823
this isn't the first time
my mom's been somewhere

24:16.923 --> 24:18.925
doing something
no one wants to talk about.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.962
She comes home with bruises

24:23.062 --> 24:24.964
or a limp.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.132
She doesn't say what happened.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.334
So I don't ask.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.471
I'm just grateful
she came home and I got to...

24:32.572 --> 24:33.873
hug her goodnight.
I'm ignoring

24:33.973 --> 24:36.275
my instinct
to give you some pat comfort

24:36.375 --> 24:38.611
like, "Your mom's strong" or...

24:38.711 --> 24:39.912
"She's too stubborn to die"?

24:40.012 --> 24:42.882
"Magic eight ball says,
'Not yet.'"

24:44.450 --> 24:47.186
But the truth is

24:47.286 --> 24:50.690
being a hero
is a dangerous job.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.826
And I don't know
what's gonna happen.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.100
You want another sandwich?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.469
No.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.037
How about some fruit?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.208
That'd be great.

25:09.308 --> 25:10.610
Cool.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.316
All right.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.685
It's probably fractured,

25:18.785 --> 25:20.720
but it's not a compound break.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.557
So there's no harm
in stabilizing it.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.027
They'll never know
to look for us down here.

25:28.795 --> 25:31.798
Which is why we can't wait
for them to fall in to find us.

25:33.165 --> 25:37.136
Hey. You had some aspirin
in your pocket. So, here.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.672
I-I've never been able
to take pills without water.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.373
Just put them in your mouth,

25:41.473 --> 25:44.611
tilt your chin to your throat
and swallow.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.354
What's your wife's name?

25:55.454 --> 25:56.956
Cassie.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.691
Cassie.

26:00.593 --> 26:03.062
You and Cassie have kids?

26:03.162 --> 26:05.531
Yeah, a boy. Meyer.

26:05.632 --> 26:08.901
He's 18 months old.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.302
He's a real handful.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.638
Well, I bet Meyer

26:11.738 --> 26:15.307
will be happy
to help you recuperate.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.109
You got kids?

26:17.209 --> 26:19.311
I do.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.615
I have two.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.687
A boy and a girl.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.624
But my son--

26:31.724 --> 26:34.627
he's about to leave for college.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.696
So he's not as cute
as your 18-month-old.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.333
You ever been shot?

26:41.433 --> 26:42.702
No.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.838
Well...

26:46.839 --> 26:49.709
it's gonna feel...

26:49.809 --> 26:53.345
worse before we get you
feeling better.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.447
Seems like the same
is true for you.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.085
Nah.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.086
Just...

27:00.186 --> 27:01.587
Just something.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.955
A little ribby.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.290
Like you broke one.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.992
Doctor should tell us later.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.797
Whatever happens,

27:10.897 --> 27:12.398
thanks for trying
to help me,

27:12.498 --> 27:14.066
Special Agent Tennant.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.004
It's Jane.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.639
But we're both going home
to our families.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.608
So don't you worry about that.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.868
Hey, there's an opening
over here.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.537
I'm gonna check it out, okay?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.341
<i>We think he's headed</i>

27:55.441 --> 27:58.945
to the parking area north
of the Townsend campground.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.813
Hold on.
I'm familiar
with that trailhead.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.749
The road in and out
is two lanes,

28:02.849 --> 28:04.350
dirt into the highway.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.819
Make sure we have barricades
set up before the highway

28:06.919 --> 28:08.420
and agents
stationed off the road

28:08.520 --> 28:11.657
in case he decides to abandon
a car and head back into cover.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.861
You're doing a great job.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.528
Tennant would be proud.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.031
Does being in charge mean that
you just spend all your time

28:19.131 --> 28:20.833
worrying that you forgot
to do something?

28:20.933 --> 28:22.701
Only when you
give a damn.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.839
Hey, when you were overseas,

28:26.939 --> 28:29.241
were you in charge
of the field hospital?

28:29.341 --> 28:32.011
Oh, they insisted once I
got promoted to commander.

28:32.111 --> 28:35.948
I was uniquely unsuited for it.
Why?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.751
I have difficulty compartmentalizing.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.252
Whereas you are
doing an amazing job

28:40.352 --> 28:42.121
holding a space of
concern for Tennant

28:42.221 --> 28:43.322
and the space

28:43.422 --> 28:45.424
for the job
that needs to be done.

28:45.524 --> 28:46.692
I can only do one or the other.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.494
I'm not sure that's a bad thing.

28:48.594 --> 28:49.929
Well, it would
be today.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.900
Which is why you are the
right man for this job.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.170
All right, I'm gonna
get some coffee. You want some?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.372
Ooh, uh, tea, if you're
up to boiling water.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.141
Oh, that's my specialty.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.242
Hello, Ernie.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.444
Hey. Ooh, thanks, Alex.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.046
Do you have limes on your tree?

29:07.947 --> 29:09.115
Some chili lime dressing

29:09.215 --> 29:10.549
would be great
on this fruit salad.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.418
You're just trying
to get rid of me.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.187
Yes, but I also really like
chili lime dressing.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.525
So,

29:19.625 --> 29:22.194
the last case
that Agent Anton worked,

29:22.294 --> 29:26.032
he goes to meet a contact to buy
some hijacked Navy equipment. Yeah.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.034
Investigators were sure
the contact worked for Harriman,

29:28.134 --> 29:30.937
but they never got to ask him
because he disappeared.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.604
Well, the equipment's gone, too.

29:32.704 --> 29:33.906
Stolen. Yeah.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.441
No. I mean gone-gone.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.943
Not in the world anywhere.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.510
There were high-end servers
on that truck.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.147
I looked for them on the web,
and they do not exist.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.648
Meaning?
BOOM-BOOM:
Meaning if he stole them...

29:42.748 --> 29:44.383
Oh! Wow.
You move quietly.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.019
Always. If he stole them
he wanted to sell them.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.155
Their digital footprint
should be out there.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.923
But it's not.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.460
But did they investigate the
disappearance of the contact?

29:54.560 --> 29:57.663
They tried, since they
thought he was the killer.

29:57.763 --> 30:00.199
They assumed he fled
to avoid federal prison.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.567
What if he didn't?

30:01.667 --> 30:04.303
Coconspirator gone.
Stolen goods gone.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.805
Harriman got rid of anything
that would tie him to the crime.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.174
So we have a missing guy

30:08.274 --> 30:10.676
and a missing truck.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.344
One of these
has to be able to help us

30:12.444 --> 30:14.881
figure out what really happened.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.110
What was I
supposed to do?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.312
He was saying the
worst things to her.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.813
Tell the bus driver.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.615
All he cares about
is us drinking sugary liquids

30:49.715 --> 30:51.017
and spilling them on the seats.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.685
And apparently kids
who punch other kids.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.389
Look, Janie,
I understand.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.526
I joined the military
to be on the side of right.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.961
But there are good fights

31:02.061 --> 31:03.996
and there are ones
that just aren't worth it.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.664
This one was worth it.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.833
What if you'd told
the kid to stop

31:07.934 --> 31:09.468
and then sat
next to Dottie?

31:09.568 --> 31:12.138
He'd pick on her every time
I'm not around.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.106
Yes, probably.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.977
And because you punched him,
you're suspended.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.079
So who's gonna
help her tomorrow?

31:22.248 --> 31:24.283
So...

31:24.383 --> 31:26.285
next time,

31:26.385 --> 31:27.453
what could you do?

31:28.988 --> 31:30.689
Tell him to stick
his lunch box up his nose

31:30.789 --> 31:32.891
then sit next to Dottie.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.362
I see no flaw in that plan.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.597
Helping Dottie only if it
doesn't get me in trouble

31:38.697 --> 31:39.932
doesn't seem very heroic.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.900
Maybe not, but sometimes

31:42.001 --> 31:43.635
you have to think
about yourself, Jane.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.371
That's what mom did.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.006
Just thought about herself.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.610
Hey.

31:51.710 --> 31:52.878
Does it hurt?

31:52.979 --> 31:55.414
Medium to low.
Does it look awful?

31:55.514 --> 31:57.883
You could never look awful.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.071
<i>Nothing here.
Let's circle back.</i>

32:19.171 --> 32:20.406
Copy.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.139
Thank God.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.419
I don't see him.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.920
Did he take the keys
from his hostage?

33:09.021 --> 33:10.189
No, she still has them,

33:10.289 --> 33:11.557
so he still needs a car.

33:11.657 --> 33:12.824
Let's draw him out. Wait.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.026
Did he see you
on the trail back there?

33:14.126 --> 33:15.361
I don't think so.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.529
Just in case.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.899
Be careful, okay?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.834
Says the woman who just
got knocked unconscious.

33:22.934 --> 33:26.272
Okay, well, feel free
to get knocked unconscious.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.939
Just nothing worse.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.142
Okay.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.411
Keys.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.734
Give me the keys.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.738
Federal agents.
Give me the gun.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.076
Hands.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.013
Now can we get
your head looked at?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.488
Meyer's gonna make
you a kick-ass thank-you card.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.958
I'll be sure to put
it on my fridge.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.095
I totally understand why Agent
Anton called you all the time.

34:23.195 --> 34:26.098
Well, he helped me
as much as I helped him.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.567
So did you.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.669
You know...

34:31.837 --> 34:33.439
...if it wasn't for
your magic vest,

34:33.539 --> 34:37.109
you would have been stuck in
that tube for a very long time.

34:38.477 --> 34:39.645
Thank you.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.016
I have her here for you.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.520
Hello?
Ah,

34:48.620 --> 34:49.821
so glad you're okay.

34:49.921 --> 34:50.622
Is she okay?

34:50.722 --> 34:51.657
Is that Alex?

34:51.757 --> 34:52.958
Yeah, we've been having lunch.

34:53.058 --> 34:56.228
Are you really okay?

34:56.328 --> 34:58.430
I'm okay enough, baby.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.332
Are you on the way home?
Soon.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.201
But I think Ernie
needs to talk to me.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.704
You need to talk to her?
I do.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.408
Oh, okay. Bye, Mom.

35:09.508 --> 35:10.876
I love you.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.744
I love you.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.115
Hey. So Boom-Boom,
Chase and I think

35:17.216 --> 35:18.450
we figured out the Seattle case.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.755
All right, thanks.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.791
I need you to take
me to Harriman.

35:30.762 --> 35:31.830
I would hug you,

35:31.930 --> 35:33.832
but it looks like
you hurt all over.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.701
Kind of do.
Yeah, okay.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.336
It's good to have
you back, boss.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.504
Has he said anything?

35:38.604 --> 35:40.906
Nothing helpful.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.179
Special Agent Tennant. You look

35:47.279 --> 35:48.580
like no amount of detergent

35:48.680 --> 35:50.749
will get the stains
out of that shirt.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.654
Before you go face
all those charges

35:55.754 --> 35:57.055
on hijacking and grand theft,

35:57.155 --> 35:59.057
I just wanted you to know

35:59.157 --> 36:01.493
we figured out what
happened in Seattle.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.463
I'm ready to go.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.265
Turns out the guy
you sent to meet Agent Anton

36:06.365 --> 36:08.367
had satellite radio.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.236
We were able to track his car.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.637
The night Anton disappeared,

36:11.737 --> 36:14.740
that same car ended up in a lake

36:14.840 --> 36:16.675
12 miles outside of Seattle.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.278
Dude must have been
a terrible driver.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.579
Dive teams are on their way.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.248
I'm guessing your
co-conspirator's body

36:22.348 --> 36:24.283
is in that car.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.651
Agent Anton's, too.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.786
Doesn't have anything
to do with me.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.488
You have managed
to stay off the radar.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.923
Never had a cell phone
tied to you.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.825
But it turns out
one burner phone

36:33.925 --> 36:35.361
pinged off the tower

36:35.461 --> 36:37.829
where Anton's was pinging
the night he disappeared.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.966
That doesn't seem
helpful to you.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.768
Yeah.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.605
That burner phone went dark
the same night.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.608
But we looked for every
burner phone that went live

36:49.708 --> 36:51.377
that evening
in the Seattle area.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.679
And one...

36:53.779 --> 36:55.681
pinged near the lake.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.285
Now, when we get footage
of that burner's purchase,

36:59.385 --> 37:00.552
I know it'll be you buying it.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.654
And that puts you at the scene.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.927
Back in the helicopter
you offered me a deal.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.430
I'm sure you're smart
enough to know

37:11.530 --> 37:12.831
that that's not gonna happen.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.666
I'll tell you where
the hijacked stuff is.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.335
Oh, we'll find it
without your help.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.638
And since you killed a marshal
on your transport detail,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.540
I am sure that his family
will be happy to know

37:21.640 --> 37:23.642
that I will go wherever
I have to go

37:23.742 --> 37:26.077
to testify against you.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.191
Did I miss an office party?

37:41.192 --> 37:42.994
We just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.297
Now that we've seen you, though,
I'm not sure the answer is yes.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.598
Ah, Tennant laughs in the face

37:46.698 --> 37:48.367
of small cuts
and scrapes.

37:48.467 --> 37:51.703
And what looks like a pretty
big bruise from direct gunfire.

37:51.803 --> 37:54.473
Right in the vest, .40 cal. That

37:54.573 --> 37:57.809
and falling in a lava tube--
that's a lot for one day.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.678
Do you need something
to eat or a ride home?

37:59.778 --> 38:00.746
No, I'm okay.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.349
I-I promise, I'm fine.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.150
The dive team called
from Seattle

38:05.250 --> 38:07.686
while you were on the drive back
and they found

38:07.786 --> 38:10.088
two bodies in the car
in the lake.

38:10.188 --> 38:12.257
It's a good chance
one of them was Anton's.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.760
Good.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.762
His family can finally
get some closure.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.797
And you too, boss.

38:19.598 --> 38:23.068
Yeah. And me too.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.742
Thank you.

38:30.842 --> 38:34.179
No, we're just
doing our jobs, boss.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.282
It's a nice sentiment.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.986
But that's not what this was.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.854
And all of you know it.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.963
Everybody should go home now.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.906
Alex, calm down.
She's almost home.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.208
How do you know that?

39:03.308 --> 39:04.342
I can't say.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.877
Meaning she's not almost home

39:05.977 --> 39:08.013
and you're just pacifying me
with vague banalities.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.015
No, meaning she's almost home.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.651
It's just that
the way I know that is...

39:12.751 --> 39:14.386
technically illegal.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.528
Mom. Hey.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.696
Hey.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.601
That's not what you
were wearing when you left.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.638
Oh. It's not?

39:32.738 --> 39:34.473
Ah...
