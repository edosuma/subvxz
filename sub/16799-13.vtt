WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:09.307
(knock at door)

00:12.310 --> 00:14.335
Hi, how can I help you?

00:14.380 --> 00:16.075
I'm looking for
Sherlock Holmes.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.271
My name's Jack Brunelle.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.312
I was hoping he could
help me with a case.

00:20.350 --> 00:23.410
18 months ago, my son was
assaulted by a man

00:23.450 --> 00:26.453
in a skimask outside
a dell In Queens.

00:26.490 --> 00:27.752
They tell me
Mr. Holmes is

00:27.790 --> 00:30.588
the secret weapon
of the NYPD.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.519
I was hoping he could help
identify my son's attacker.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.323
Um, I'd really love
to help you,

00:35.360 --> 00:36.566
but we're smack
in the middle of something.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.295
A man in Riverdale
was murdered

00:38.330 --> 00:40.537
over a priceless
Mongolian fossil.

00:40.570 --> 00:41.832
I know you're busy,
but it would only

00:41.870 --> 00:43.098
take a few minutes.
(phone ringing)

00:43.140 --> 00:45.506
Excuse me.
Hey, Sherlock.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.508
Yes, I am on my way.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.577
Mr. Brunelle, maybe you
can come back another time?

00:57.520 --> 00:58.589
(door opens)

00:58.620 --> 01:00.554
MASON: This guy was
at the door.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.558
Says he absolutely needs
to talk to you.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.582
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.598
I'm Jack Brunelle.

01:07.630 --> 01:09.188
Mr. Brunelle, yes.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.595
You wrote_ to me
several times.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.599
Your son Connor was attacked,
ended up in a coma,

01:13.640 --> 01:15.198
and when he finally
regained consciousness,

01:15.240 --> 01:16.559
he was addicted
to painkillers, right?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.407
And then heroin.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.533
He died from an overdose
less than a year later.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.548
Oh, I'm truly sorry.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.844
Connor was murdered.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.575
Now, you can draw
a straight line

01:26.620 --> 01:29.589
from the assault
to his death,

01:29.620 --> 01:30.746
but the police
treated it like

01:30.790 --> 01:32.610
it was just another
mugging.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.311
Still, we're kind of in the
middle of something right now.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.524
Could you have your son
maybe wait outside?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.551
Gross!

01:41.600 --> 01:42.794
Mason is not my offspring.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.866
He's a budding
computer scientist.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.868
He's helping me evaluate
the artificial intelligence

01:46.900 --> 01:48.561
of that doll,

01:48.600 --> 01:50.636
as part of a murder
investigation.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.729
I receive many
inquiries like yours.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.408
Unfortunately,
circumstance dictates that

01:55.440 --> 01:58.409
I can only apply my talents
where they are most needed.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.247
I need your talents.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.838
Connor needs
your talents.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.814
Well, you have my genuine
sympathy, Mr. Brunelle,

02:03.850 --> 02:05.249
but I'm sorry,

02:05.290 --> 02:08.350
you can't have
my help.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.258
Mr. Brunelle, I admire
your persistence,

02:15.300 --> 02:16.699
but I'm afraid human nature
hasn't changed

02:16.730 --> 02:17.822
since your last visit.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.394
We remain awash
With murder.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.238
You're carrying
a roller derby roster?

02:22.270 --> 02:23.908
Yes, one of those
women was

02:23.940 --> 02:25.862
strangled to death
and dumped in a river.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.708
It's just that the statute
of limitations

02:28.740 --> 02:30.503
on my son's case
is getting close,

02:30.550 --> 02:32.279
and no one's making
any progress.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.914
The state of New York
allows you five years

02:34.950 --> 02:36.918
to start assault
proceedings.

02:36.950 --> 02:38.884
After that, the attacker
can't be prosecuted.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.184
He's free.

02:41.220 --> 02:44.383
My son was assaulted
in January of 2012,

02:44.430 --> 02:46.591
which means I have
less than a year

02:46.630 --> 02:47.927
to find his attacker

02:47.960 --> 02:50.428
before the statute
of limitations expires.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.892
Mr. Brunelle,
I understand your dilemma.

02:51.930 --> 02:55.229
You feel a great pressure
to right a criminal wrong,

02:55.270 --> 02:56.237
but Watson and I are
struggling to solve

02:56.270 --> 02:58.238
two murders at the moment.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.931
There might come a time
when we can offer some help,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.470
but I'm afraid it isn't today.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.409
(pop music playing
in background)

03:20.260 --> 03:22.865
All right, everybody,
get your hands up!

03:22.900 --> 03:24.697
Get 'em up!
I said get 'em up!

03:24.730 --> 03:26.994
Get 'em up!
Get your hands up!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.689
Up! Up!

03:28.740 --> 03:30.935
Oh, my God.

03:30.970 --> 03:34.007
Stop, please.
Don't hurt anyone.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.304
I can open
the cash register.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.977
I don't want money.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.615
Then what do you want?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.746
Sherlock, Joan.

03:46.050 --> 03:49.258
Half hour ago, a man
with a shotgun walked in

03:49.290 --> 03:50.951
and took the place over.
WATSON: What does he want?

03:50.990 --> 03:52.355
You.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.356
Guy's name is
Jack Brunelle.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.697
He told the hostage
negotiator

03:55.730 --> 03:57.391
he wanted to talk
to Sherlock Holmes

03:57.430 --> 03:59.933
and Joan Watson, or he was
gonna start shooting people.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.438
He's asked for our help
many times.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.506
I guess he got tired
of being polite about it.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.734
He's got 20 hostages.

04:05.770 --> 04:08.000
We should talk to him.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.439
GREGSON: You're not
gomg anywhere.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.347
Let's get you
on the phone first.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.916
He'll just demand
that we go in.

04:13.950 --> 04:15.269
If Brunelle wanted
to kill us,

04:15.320 --> 04:17.015
he's had ample opportunity.

04:18.490 --> 04:19.809
He doesn't want us dead.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.249
He wants us working.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.742
Hands on the counter.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.823
Long way to go to hire
a couple of detectives,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.418
don't you think?

05:04.370 --> 05:05.689
Sit.

05:05.730 --> 05:08.597
I've been trying to get you
to help me for years.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.336
Well, you sure as hell
can't ignore me now.

05:11.370 --> 05:13.531
You're gonna figure out
what happened to Connor.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.378
Even if you found the person
who assaulted your son,

05:16.410 --> 05:18.048
that's all we can charge him
with-- assault, not murder.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.469
Well, he could
go to jail for years.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.341
If he's got priors,
it could be decades.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.779
You don't know what will happen
when you find him.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.117
Nobody does.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.378
But we're gonna find out,

05:29.430 --> 05:31.318
or I'm gonna shoot
all of these people.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.793
Some of Connor's old things.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.491
Might be a good
place to start.

05:40.540 --> 05:44.067
All right...

05:44.110 --> 05:46.408
let's go.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.772
No. You go.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.573
You're staying.
What?

05:50.610 --> 05:52.669
Your partner dies
with everybody else

05:52.720 --> 05:54.073
if you don't deliver.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.917
If I don't deliver,

05:55.950 --> 05:58.145
it will be
because she stays.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.078
We work as a team.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.849
I require her counsel.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.381
JACK:
Well, you can have it
anytime you want.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.751
By phone.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.449
I'll keep her close to me.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.991
Make sure she doesn't
miss a call.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.396
Go.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.590
We'll be fine.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.413
Oh, one more thing.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.771
What?

06:28.820 --> 06:31.789
My son was attacked exactly
five years ago today.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.459
Which means the statute
of limitations

06:34.490 --> 06:36.720
on his assault
runs out at midnight.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.081
That's why we're here.

06:39.130 --> 06:43.590
Today is the last day
anyone can help Connor.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.689
It's five after 8:00.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.197
You got about

06:47.240 --> 06:49.060
16 hours

06:49.100 --> 06:51.102
to find the man
who attacked my son.

06:51.140 --> 06:54.576
And if you don't...

06:54.610 --> 06:56.999
I'll start shooting.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.645
*

07:08.560 --> 07:09.925
Finally dug up
the original paperwork

07:09.960 --> 07:11.951
on Connor Brunelle's
assault.

07:11.990 --> 07:15.027
The case was opened
on January 29, 2012,

07:15.060 --> 07:18.496
by Detective Donald Andrews
in the 107th precinct.

07:18.530 --> 07:21.465
I hate to cast judgment
on a brother in blue,

07:21.500 --> 07:22.865
but doesn't look like
Detective Andrews

07:22.910 --> 07:24.468
lost much sleep
on this one.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.501
I doubt there's much here
that's gonna help us.

07:26.540 --> 07:27.939
You think Brunelle
will go through with it?

07:27.980 --> 07:29.800
Is he really gonna
shoot 20 people

07:29.850 --> 07:31.499
if we don't solve this case?

07:31.550 --> 07:33.040
Doesn't matter what I think.
Armed standoffs have a habit

07:33.080 --> 07:35.139
of ending unpredictably.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.943
You got something?

07:36.990 --> 07:39.015
Text messages
from five years ago

07:39.050 --> 07:42.053
between Connor and
a Dario Canales.

07:42.090 --> 07:45.025
Mr. Canales appears to be
a lawyer of some kind.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.596
Now, at ﬁrst glance,
the messages,

07:46.630 --> 07:47.995
they're quite harmless.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.897
"Bring issue 622
of Linden Law Review at 5:15.

07:50.930 --> 07:54.138
Hoyt Trial,
February 12, 9:00."

07:54.170 --> 07:55.899
There are several clues,
however, that indicate

07:55.940 --> 07:57.862
_ these are_ more than
just scheduling banalities.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.707
Such as?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.743
The Linden Law Review
is not a real publication.

08:02.780 --> 08:06.238
Also, there were no trials
in New York on February 12.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.816
Why is that?

08:07.850 --> 08:09.511
Abraham Lincoln's birthday.

08:09.550 --> 08:10.778
New York is one
of seven states

08:10.820 --> 08:11.912
which observes it
as a holiday,

08:11.950 --> 08:13.508
and all the courthouses
are closed.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.949
Mm, you know, Linden
and Hoyt are

08:15.990 --> 08:17.582
both streets in Brooklyn.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.621
The_se texts could be
setting up meetings.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.766
622 Linden Avenue, 5:15.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.791
12 Hoyt Street, 9:00 am.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.991
Let me guess, you're already
two steps ahead of me.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.598
At least two.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.904
All right, so why all
the secrecy in the messages?

08:30.940 --> 08:33.932
I suspect Connor
and Dario were lovers.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.277
Dario was married.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.800
He has been since
New York passed

08:38.010 --> 08:40.274
The final messages
grow tense.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.312
I suspect the affair
ended poorly.

08:43.350 --> 08:45.614
If Dario was unhappy
about the breakup,

08:45.650 --> 08:47.709
that would give him motive
to want to hurt Connor.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.159
We should track this guy down.
Mm-hmm.

08:49.190 --> 08:51.021
He's at the New York
County Supreme Court,

08:51.060 --> 08:55.053
arguing a case there today,
according to his Twitter feed.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.249
DARIO:
Yes,

08:56.300 --> 08:57.619
I was seeing Connor,

08:57.670 --> 08:59.558
but I didn't attack him.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.862
I loved him.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.128
Mr. Canales,
you're a lavwer.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.899
You know very well
that love is often

09:03.940 --> 09:05.862
the motive for the most
gruesome of crimes.

09:05.910 --> 09:09.232
It is, but I was on vacation

09:09.280 --> 09:11.202
in Aruba when it happened.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.945
Check my credit
card statements.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.971
I have photos, too.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.215
The man in the diner,
you said he'd

09:17.250 --> 09:19.081
give you till midnight,
right?

09:19.120 --> 09:21.088
I'll answer your questions
all day long,

09:21.120 --> 09:24.055
but I'm telling you right now
I'm not your guy.

09:24.090 --> 09:26.650
All right, well,
what about your husband?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.122
We cracked the code
you two used.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.060
Maybe he did, too.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.091
I told you I was on vacation
in Aruba when it happened.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.189
Who do you think I was
on vacation with?

09:34.240 --> 09:37.061
Your affair with Connor
ended in 2012.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.361
So what happened?

09:38.410 --> 09:40.037
DARIO:
Law school didn't
work out,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.969
so he took some job
at a warehouse in Red Hook.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.899
The graveyard shift,
and he worked crazy hours.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.372
It made it impossible
to see each other.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.115
Wait, back up a sec.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.687
What do you mean
"law school didn't work out"?

09:51.720 --> 09:53.688
When the second year began,

09:53.720 --> 09:55.153
he couldn't keep up
with the work.

09:55.190 --> 09:57.283
Started missing classes,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.389
failing tests.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.648
After a few months,
they kicked him out.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.760
His father didn't know.
Nobody knew.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.236
Connor was too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.864
I'm sure people would have
figured it out soon enough,

10:10.910 --> 10:12.969
except he was attacked
just after it happened,

10:13.010 --> 10:15.808
and was dead
less than a year later.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.003
Tell us more about this
warehouse where he worked.

10:19.050 --> 10:22.042
(phone ringing)

10:22.080 --> 10:23.809
May I?

10:25.220 --> 10:27.984
Sherlock, you're on speaker.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.352
HOLMES: Mr. Brunelle, your son
failed out of law school

10:30.390 --> 10:32.085
and was working at a warehouse
in Red Hook

10:32.130 --> 10:33.199
at the time of the attack.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.424
What?

10:34.460 --> 10:36.189
He never told you
about that job,

10:36.230 --> 10:38.790
but it's possible you saw
some evidence lying around.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.434
So, I'm gonna read you the names

10:40.470 --> 10:42.290
of some businesses
from that area.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.900
Stop me if anything
sounds familiar.

10:44.940 --> 10:48.899
Grimwald Partners,
Hardcastle Beam,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.100
Morgan and Holt.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.299
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.443
Morgan and Holt.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.119
Connor had a hat
with that written on it.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.845
I thought it was a law firm.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.755
You think this job
has something to do

10:59.790 --> 11:00.814
with Connor's assault?

11:00.860 --> 11:01.815
That's precisely the question

11:01.860 --> 11:02.929
we're trying to answer.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.279
I'll check in with you

11:04.330 --> 11:06.389
once we've paid a visit
to Morgan and Holt.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.137
(sighs)

11:14.170 --> 11:16.388
Is it okay if
I make some coffee?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.237
No.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.431
It's 10:30,

11:20.480 --> 11:22.436
we've been here
for two and a half hours.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.948
I'm not asking you

11:24.980 --> 11:27.949
to set everyone free, just...

11:27.980 --> 11:30.881
some coffee,
maybe a bathroom break.

11:44.530 --> 11:47.135
So, what do you do for work?

11:47.170 --> 11:48.432
Don't do that.

11:48.470 --> 11:49.869
Do what?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.138
I'm not your friend.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.335
I'm the guy
who's a half a day away

11:55.380 --> 11:57.268
from shooting a diner
full of people.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.403
Yeah, I don't know.

11:59.450 --> 12:01.441
You don't know what?

12:01.480 --> 12:05.109
I don't know if you're actually
gonna kill anybody.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.924
You're doing this
because you love your son.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.099
You want justice.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.950
You're desperate, but...

12:15.000 --> 12:16.797
you don't strike me
as the type of person

12:16.830 --> 12:20.766
_that would murder
innocent strangers.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.234
That bulge
in your jacket pocket,

12:23.270 --> 12:25.807
that's an extra box
of shotgun shells.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.308
You can't be carrying
more than 12.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.274
There are 20 hostages

12:30.310 --> 12:32.301
in this diner.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.818
21, including me.

12:34.850 --> 12:37.148
Now, you don't have
enough ammunition

12:37.190 --> 12:40.216
to kill everyone here,
because you have no intention

12:40.260 --> 12:42.888
of killing
everyone here.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.455
Yeah, you got me
all figured out.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.520
I'm not a threat.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.563
What if I told you
you're right?

12:52.600 --> 12:56.161
I don't plan to kill all the
hostages if your partner fails.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.339
Ijust plan to kill him.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.298
And who is he?

13:04.350 --> 13:08.070
Donald Andrews.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.089
Retired NYPD.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.317
He's the detective who caught
my son's case five years ago

13:14.360 --> 13:15.918
and did nothing!

13:15.960 --> 13:19.088
You were content
to just Sit on your ass,

13:19.130 --> 13:22.452
while the man
who attacked my son went free.

13:22.500 --> 13:27.039
You tied him up
because you know him.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.935
I had enough of his excuses
for one lifetime.

13:30.570 --> 13:32.333
You say I didn't
bring enough

13:32.370 --> 13:34.372
ammo for everyone in the diner?

13:34.410 --> 13:36.298
Well, that may be.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.446
But I sure as hell
brought enough for him.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.184
NORM: Yeah, I remember Connor.
Good kid.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.346
A real shame,
what happened to him.

13:45.390 --> 13:46.345
Well, we were told

13:46.390 --> 13:48.858
he was working here at
the time of his assault.

13:48.890 --> 13:50.881
He was the overnight
security guard.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.024
Though, to be honest, there
wasn't much for him to guard.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.357
What do you mean?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.958
Well, this company's
on its last legs.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.127
Has been for a decade now.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.968
Not a whole lot of product
coming through the door.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.638
I only pay
an overnight guard

14:03.670 --> 14:06.002
to keep an eye
on the building at night.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.632
Make sure teenagers
don't vandalize it,

14:07.680 --> 14:08.704
that sort of thing.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.640
Can you confirm that Connor
would have been working

14:10.680 --> 14:12.375
the night
that he was assaulted?

14:12.410 --> 14:14.219
Yeah, he would
have been.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.615
Hmm. So, he was assaulted

14:15.650 --> 14:17.481
just hours before
his shift was due to start.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.385
Did you have to find
a replacement that night?

14:19.420 --> 14:23.356
(chuckles) Hard enough
finding one guy to do the job.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.529
Good luck finding a second
at the eleventh hour.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.323
So it's safe
to assume, then,

14:27.360 --> 14:28.452
that the night he was attacked,

14:28.500 --> 14:29.899
this place was left unguarded

14:29.930 --> 14:31.295
until _
the next morning?

14:31.330 --> 14:33.469
Yeah, probably.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.162
Thank you very much.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.462
BELL:
What's up?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.205
I think the purpose
of Connor's assault

14:39.240 --> 14:40.275
was_ to ensure that
this warehouse

14:40.310 --> 14:41.538
was left wholly unguarded

14:41.580 --> 14:43.309
on a particular night
five years ago.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.648
We're gonna go discern why.

14:49.220 --> 14:52.986
There a... reason you've got
a totem pole in your bathroom?

14:53.020 --> 14:54.385
It's too big
for the closet.

14:54.420 --> 14:55.682
Hmm.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.381
What am I
looking at?

14:57.430 --> 14:58.522
It's New York
from above.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.050
This is a small

15:00.100 --> 15:02.227
fragment of the
thousands of hours

15:02.260 --> 15:04.228
of covert surveillance footage
recorded by the FBI

15:04.270 --> 15:05.999
and their fleet of drones.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.634
They do so over many
major US. cities.

15:07.670 --> 15:10.434
All in the name
of homeland security. Hmm.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.438
This particular clip
was recorded

15:12.470 --> 15:14.404
January 29, 2012.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.635
The night Connor was attacked.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.942
Mm-hmm. This is the warehouse

15:17.980 --> 15:19.004
we visited earlier.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.119
I'm hoping this
will give me

15:20.150 --> 15:21.344
some insight as to why someone

15:21.380 --> 15:22.938
wanted it left unguarded
that night.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.288
Where the hell did you get this?

15:25.320 --> 15:27.379
Agent McNally of the NSA. Shh.

15:27.420 --> 15:31.254
He owed me a favor, I helped
untangle a rather ugly incident

15:31.290 --> 15:33.429
involving Belgium,
the Dalai Lama,

15:33.460 --> 15:34.495
and a stolen wheel
of priceless cheese.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.599
What incident was that?

15:35.630 --> 15:36.995
Exactly.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.494
Are those boats?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.634
Shipping barges.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.638
And those are
barrels, right?

15:45.670 --> 15:48.503
This looks like some kind
of smuggling operation.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.511
_ The barrels are
being loaded onto trucks.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.313
There must be
a thousand barrels.

15:55.350 --> 15:56.510
Any idea what's inside 'em?

15:56.550 --> 15:58.211
Could be anything.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.444
Whatever it is,

15:59.490 --> 16:01.117
there's a lot of it.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.479
I count a dozen
tractor-trailers.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.556
Those things can carry
80,000 pounds apiece.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.353
The single
biggest cache

16:06.390 --> 16:09.393
of smuggled goods on record
is the 1989 Sylmar bust.

16:09.430 --> 16:12.695
ATF agents found 20 tons
of cocaine

16:12.730 --> 16:14.266
in a Californian warehouse.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.461
Now, given the sheer
number of barrels,

16:16.500 --> 16:18.559
and the holding capacity
of a dozen trucks,

16:18.610 --> 16:20.532
this could dwarf that.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.434
So, the assault
on Connor Brunelle

16:22.480 --> 16:26.143
was garden-variety,
but it might be connected

16:26.180 --> 16:28.546
to what could be

16:28.580 --> 16:31.981
the single largest smuggling
payload in American history.

16:41.560 --> 16:42.527
HOLMES: So there's a dozen
Kenworth T440 trucks

16:42.560 --> 16:45.688
with Paccar PX-8 engines
and fixed grill hoods.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.766
But you already know that,
Mr. Trimble.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.392
According to the DMV,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.465
the rental company you work for
is the only business

16:51.510 --> 16:53.239
in the area with a fleet

16:53.280 --> 16:54.508
of those
specific vehicles.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.098
_ HOLMES:
Five years ago,

16:56.140 --> 16:58.347
th_ese trucks _
were used in a smuggling plot,

16:58.380 --> 16:59.802
to bring hundreds
of steel barrels

16:59.850 --> 17:01.408
by boat,
into New York.

17:01.450 --> 17:02.644
Says who?

17:02.680 --> 17:05.148
Says the photographs
you're holding.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.408
They were taken
the night of the operation.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.314
BELL: You managed the fleet
for the company, Frank.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.578
Signing trucks in and out,
scheduling maintenance.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.154
We're told a vehicle
doesn't leave the lot

17:13.200 --> 17:14.497
without your say-so.

17:14.530 --> 17:18.318
Which means you were very likely
involved in the plot.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.462
BELL:
So here's the deal.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.229
You tell us about the plot,

17:21.270 --> 17:22.362
what was in those barrels,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.163
who attacked
Connor Brunelle,

17:24.210 --> 17:26.235
and we'll tell the DA.
how helpful you were

17:26.270 --> 17:27.771
in saving the lives
of 20 people.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.501
Okay, look...

17:31.550 --> 17:33.814
those are my trucks,
but I swear to you,

17:33.850 --> 17:37.513
_ I wasn't involved
in any smuggling plot.

17:37.550 --> 17:40.553
That was the Shoreline 99s.

17:40.590 --> 17:44.378
The gang from South Queens,
those Shoreline 99s?

17:44.430 --> 17:45.579
They used to run cocaine

17:45.630 --> 17:47.120
in the neighborhood
around our company.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.526
One night, around
ten years back,

17:49.560 --> 17:51.528
a few of 'em show
up on my lot

17:51.570 --> 17:54.368
and tell me that I got
to let them use my trucks

17:54.400 --> 17:55.560
whenever they want,

17:55.600 --> 17:58.763
to move their drugs
around or whatever.

17:58.810 --> 18:01.529
I tried to say no, they
threatened to kill me.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.175
Said they knew
where I lived.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.246
After that, I'd
get messages

18:07.280 --> 18:10.408
saying to leave keys
in certain vehicles.

18:10.450 --> 18:11.781
The trucks vanished
that night,

18:11.820 --> 18:13.685
would be back
in the morning.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.756
I didn't know where they went
or what they were used for.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.588
I just did what I was told
so I didn't get hurt.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.622
So, you said that
they used to run cocaine

18:21.660 --> 18:23.161
in your neighborhood.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.758
I stopped hearing
from them

18:24.800 --> 18:27.598
right after this smuggling
thing you're talking about.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.767
They dropped
off the map.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.770
Even if I wanted to find them,
I wouldn't know where to look.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.698
BELL:
So the Shoreline 99s

18:35.740 --> 18:37.446
pull the biggest smuggling
caper in American history

18:37.480 --> 18:38.606
and then disappear.

18:38.650 --> 18:39.878
Perhaps the two events
are related.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.741
The Shoreline 99s disappeared
because they pulled

18:41.780 --> 18:43.589
the biggest smuggling caper
in American history.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.748
Landing that big score allowed
them to cash out and move on?

18:46.790 --> 18:48.519
Wouldn't be the_first criminals
to retire.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.824
I was wondering if the
Shoreline 99s' vanishing act

18:50.860 --> 18:52.782
was less voluntary
than that.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.253
During my first year
as a detective,

18:55.300 --> 18:57.268
I caught a couple gang
shootings that went down

18:57.300 --> 18:58.767
on Shoreline 99 turf.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.791
They were at war with
a Nicaraguan gang

19:00.840 --> 19:01.932
called "Santo Matn,"

19:01.970 --> 19:03.835
over the drug game
in South Queens.

19:03.870 --> 19:06.509
From what I remember,
Santo Matn was winning.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.337
So you think they were
hunted to extinction?

19:08.380 --> 19:10.598
Wouldn't be the first time
one gang Wiped out another.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.606
If that's how it went
down in this case,

19:12.650 --> 19:14.311
Santo Matn would be

19:14.350 --> 19:15.942
the best source of info
on our missmg gangsters.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.242
You know,
I'll reach out

19:17.290 --> 19:19.246
_ to a friend
in Narcotics,

19:19.290 --> 19:21.713
see if he can make contact
with the Nicaraguans.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.853
Can't exactly go
walking into gang territory

19:23.890 --> 19:26.552
with a sign that says,
"Looking for bad guys."

19:32.830 --> 19:35.333
(sighs)
This is a bad idea.

19:35.370 --> 19:36.689
Don't have time
for good ideas.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.799
Jack Brunelle's
clock is ticking.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.274
(phone ringing)

19:43.410 --> 19:44.946
You've got us both.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.971
HOLMES: Mr. Brunelle?
By way of an update,

19:47.010 --> 19:49.274
uh, we believe
that your son was assaulted

19:49.320 --> 19:52.312
as part of a smuggling plot by
a gang called the Shoreline 99s.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.715
My colleague and I,

19:53.760 --> 19:56.217
we're zeroing in on them
as we speak.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.284
I'll call you back.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.581
Get in.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.983
And you are?

20:00.030 --> 20:01.588
That one.

20:05.030 --> 20:07.498
Yeah, I though you said we were
just gonna talk to these guys.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.996
I did and we shall.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.359
You really think
it's a good idea

20:10.410 --> 20:11.399
to drive off
with them?

20:11.440 --> 20:12.930
I think Watson's life
is at stake,

20:12.970 --> 20:14.835
as are the lives
of 20 other people.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.338
You comin'?

20:28.390 --> 20:30.654
(distant siren wailing)

20:30.690 --> 20:32.920
So, how long have you
been sick, Jack?

20:32.960 --> 20:35.690
The red le_sion behind
your right ear,

20:35.730 --> 20:38.460
it's a marker for
basal cell carcmoma.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.799
Skin cancer.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.968
Doesn't look like you've
been treating it, either.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.408
Is that why you're
taking this risk?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.341
The ultimatum,
the hostages?

20:52.380 --> 20:54.541
You think you're gonna
die soon anyway.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.514
Is that it?

20:59.750 --> 21:03.425
Do you have any idea
what it's like to lose a child?

21:05.060 --> 21:08.427
If you ask any parent

21:08.460 --> 21:12.396
if they would die in place
of a daughter or a son,

21:12.430 --> 21:14.762
I guarantee you
the answer would be yes.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.405
And do you know why?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.328
It's not because of honor,

21:19.370 --> 21:20.576
or duty,

21:20.610 --> 21:23.443
or parental responsibility.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.574
It's because it's easier.

21:26.610 --> 21:30.341
It's easier to die
than it is to be left behind.

21:36.490 --> 21:39.584
Every morning
since Connor passed away,

21:39.630 --> 21:44.499
I wake up and I wish
it was me instead of him.

21:44.530 --> 21:46.589
So, no.

21:46.630 --> 21:48.939
Answer to your question,

21:48.970 --> 21:51.962
I'm not treating my skin cancer.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.773
Does that_mean
I'm gonna die soon?

21:53.810 --> 21:56.438
I don't know.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.519
But a guy can hope, right?

22:01.620 --> 22:04.544
(Spanish rap song playing)

22:13.030 --> 22:15.021
I'm told you're looking for us.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.096
JUSt as a means to an end.

22:17.130 --> 22:18.768
And what end is that?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.836
The Shoreline 99s.

22:20.870 --> 22:22.360
What about them?

22:22.400 --> 22:23.867
Well, given
your group's

22:23.910 --> 22:26.401
long and bumpy
history with them,

22:26.440 --> 22:28.908
we were wondering if you
knew where to find them.

22:28.940 --> 22:30.771
I wish I could.

22:30.810 --> 22:33.449
I'd love nothing more
than to sit back

22:33.480 --> 22:35.710
and watch the NYPD stomp
a mudhole in those boys.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.718
Truth is,

22:37.750 --> 22:39.445
we ain't seen them in years.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.378
That 'cause you wiped
them all out?

22:41.420 --> 22:43.684
That's because they disappeared.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.618
One day, they were crawling
all over our turf,

22:45.660 --> 22:47.389
sticking their noses
where they don't belong,

22:47.430 --> 22:48.920
the next,

22:48.960 --> 22:50.791
poof, gone.

22:50.830 --> 22:53.594
And good riddance,
as far as I'm concerned.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.438
Where was the last place
you saw any of their members?

22:56.470 --> 22:59.598
They used to roll
out of a spot down on 160th,

22:59.640 --> 23:01.437
just past Brinkerhoff.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.040
No point in writing
that down, man.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.445
Building ain't there no more.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.845
They bulldozed it.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.486
You used to be a member
of the Shoreline 99s.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.942
Could you be
of assistance?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.457
What?

23:13.490 --> 23:15.014
Well, all the members
have the same tattoo,

23:15.060 --> 23:18.484
the triangle on your... neck.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.498
_ It's a _nod_ to the
intersection in Queens

23:20.530 --> 23:22.998
where the, uh,
gang first formed.

23:23.030 --> 23:24.827
And yours is... it's
been lasered off,

23:24.870 --> 23:27.839
but you still have
the, uh, scar, so...

23:27.870 --> 23:29.531
You know where they are?

23:31.210 --> 23:32.734
That true, Reggie?

23:36.780 --> 23:38.998
Yeah.
H was in the Shoreline 99s.

23:39.050 --> 23:42.213
But look, I was 16 years old,
all right? I...

23:42.250 --> 23:43.649
You know, corner boy.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.544
I mean, mostly. But you know,
five years ago,

23:45.590 --> 23:47.558
these guys at the top,
they gathered us all together

23:47.590 --> 23:48.989
and they told us it was over,
all right?

23:49.020 --> 23:50.658
They were disbanding
the gang.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.988
They say why?

23:53.030 --> 23:54.725
No, man. They just cut us
loose. All right?

23:54.760 --> 23:57.524
And that was that. I got rid
of my tat, and I joined up

23:57.570 --> 23:59.629
with these boys,
and I've been here ever since.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.558
I've been loyal ever since.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.636
BELL: When was the last
time you saw anyone

24:03.670 --> 24:05.558
from the Shoreline 99s?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.475
Maybe two years ago.

24:07.510 --> 24:10.673
The leader of the gang, Terrell,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.678
I remember,
he told me I owed him money,

24:12.710 --> 24:13.938
so he wanted
to meet up.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.471
Meet him where?

24:19.520 --> 24:21.010
The manager
remembers Terrell Martin.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.085
Said he used to come here
all the time.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.587
"Used to."

24:24.630 --> 24:26.655
Manager says she hasn't
seen him in years.

24:26.690 --> 24:28.499
Got to think
she's telling the truth.

24:28.530 --> 24:29.656
I poked around a little inside,

24:29.700 --> 24:31.167
didn't see anything
out of place.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.964
If Shoreline 99 is using
this spot as a front,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.991
they're doing a hell
of a good job hiding it.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.962
Nothing to hide. They're
not using that place.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.535
I think they might
be using that place.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.832
Public records indicate that
building was foreclosed on

24:42.880 --> 24:45.974
a decade ago. Yet,
the front door is secured

24:46.010 --> 24:49.719
with brand new Medeco—
shrouded padlock shackles,

24:49.750 --> 24:51.547
and_there are four Arecont
ViSion Dome Cameras

24:51.590 --> 24:52.784
around the perimeter.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.515
Someone has gone
to a lot of bother

24:54.560 --> 24:56.050
to roll out
the unwelcome mat.

24:56.090 --> 24:59.685
And you think that someone
is the Shoreline 99s.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.550
Terrell asked Reggie to meet
him at this donut shop,

25:01.600 --> 25:03.989
and we thought they were
using it as as a gang front.

25:04.030 --> 25:06.066
Well, I think it might
be gang front adjacent.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.897
BELL:
Terrell holds
his meetings here

25:07.940 --> 25:09.134
because it's across
the street from the place

25:09.170 --> 25:11.604
Shoreline 99 does control.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.631
Is it just me, Detective
Bell, or do you hear that?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.534
Hear.. what?

25:15.580 --> 25:17.104
The sound of evidence
being destroyed?

25:17.140 --> 25:19.074
It's coming from
inside that building.

25:19.110 --> 25:21.943
Thank heavens the Supreme
Court 2011 ruling

25:21.980 --> 25:25.279
in Kentucky v. King
grants us probable cause

25:25.320 --> 25:28.983
to search the premises in
precisely this situation.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.954
(shears snip metal, door creaks)

25:35.160 --> 25:38.789
BELL: Well, now we know
where those barrels ended up.

26:01.220 --> 26:02.778
What do we got?

26:02.820 --> 26:04.026
Cocaine?

26:05.060 --> 26:07.028
Afraid not.

26:09.700 --> 26:12.726
BELL:
What is it, then?

26:12.770 --> 26:14.761
It's maple syrup.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.917
How did it go with CSU?

26:29.950 --> 26:31.679
We searched that
building top to bottom,

26:31.720 --> 26:33.881
found plenty more barrels,
but not much else.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.217
You came back here
to eat pancakes?

26:35.260 --> 26:37.319
Maple syrup. I had an idea.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.124
The problem with maple syrup
is that the natural production

26:40.160 --> 26:41.752
of it varies wildly

26:41.800 --> 26:44.223
from year to year.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.919
To combat this issue,
the Federation

26:45.970 --> 26:47.198
of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers

26:47.230 --> 26:49.391
modulates production
of the stuff.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.408
They set production quotas.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.034
Now, these quotas have
no doubt helped some artisans,

26:54.080 --> 26:56.708
but it also punishes others
because they're unable to sell

26:56.740 --> 26:58.401
their surplus supply.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.078
So it ends up getting sold
on the black market

27:01.120 --> 27:02.917
alongside drugs
and guns. I know.

27:02.950 --> 27:04.815
Obviously, that's what
the Shoreline 99s' leadership

27:04.850 --> 27:06.283
was up to five years ago.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.153
The question is, what does
that have to do with this?

27:09.190 --> 27:11.226
Well, I tasted some of the
Shoreline 99s' maple syrup

27:11.260 --> 27:12.659
before I left their building.

27:12.690 --> 27:15.158
It has a woody,
vanilla essence, with a hint

27:15.200 --> 27:17.225
of crushed leaves.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.364
IfI can identify a batch
of syrup from one of the...

27:19.400 --> 27:23.268
city's many
pancake dispensaries,

27:23.300 --> 27:25.700
with the same flavor profile...

27:25.740 --> 27:29.176
You'll know who's buying the
Shoreline 99s' illegal syrup.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.804
And from there, it should be...

27:31.850 --> 27:33.249
That's a match.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.077
Which restaurant?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.849
Crescent Moon Cafe
in Greenpomt.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.279
I'll send patrol over there,
see if we can get the name

27:38.320 --> 27:40.345
of whoever's delivering
their syrup.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.724
The hell am I doing here?

27:44.760 --> 27:47.251
You're about to be arrested
for trafficking stolen property

27:47.290 --> 27:49.019
and violating
federal customs laws.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.858
You've been selling illegal
Canadian maple syrup

27:51.900 --> 27:53.868
to The_Crescent Moon Cafe
in Greenpomt,

27:53.900 --> 27:56.095
as well as a number
of other places, I'm sure.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.700
We just confiscated a few
hundred barrels of the stuff

27:58.740 --> 28:00.037
at your stash house in Queens.

28:00.070 --> 28:01.173
On top of that,

28:01.210 --> 28:03.405
there are several outstanding
warrants for your arrest

28:03.440 --> 28:05.704
from your days as a member
of the Shoreline 99s.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.173
When all is said and done,
you're looking

28:08.220 --> 28:09.972
at some pretty serious
jail time.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.840
The dark cloud
that you find yourself under

28:11.890 --> 28:15.451
does, however,
have a silver lining...?

28:15.490 --> 28:17.481
You help us with our case,
and we'll put in a good word

28:17.520 --> 28:19.283
with the district attorney.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.218
Maybe he goes easy on you
when the time comes.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.023
What case?

28:23.060 --> 28:25.790
Five years ago, the
Shoreline 99s smuggled a load

28:25.830 --> 28:27.297
of maple syrup into New York.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.436
Interesting move for a group
that dealt in cocaine.

28:30.470 --> 28:33.303
Yeah, the drug game
was good to us at first.

28:33.340 --> 28:36.207
You know, we sold our product,
made decent money,

28:36.240 --> 28:38.049
didn't ruffle any feathers.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.140
Then these young guns show up,
start muscling in on our turf.

28:41.180 --> 28:43.444
Santo Matn.
Yeah. Killer Saint.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.244
Emphasis on the "Killer."
Those guys are nuts, man.

28:46.290 --> 28:49.179
It's all "Shoot first,
ask questions never" with them.

28:49.220 --> 28:50.778
You know, pretty soon,
we spending more time

28:50.830 --> 28:52.525
dodging bullets
than we are selling coke.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.494
Felt like living
in a war zone.

28:54.530 --> 28:57.328
So when our leader, Terrell,
said he had a way to get out,

28:57.360 --> 28:58.497
we was, like, "Yeah."

28:58.530 --> 29:00.293
The syrup heist was his idea?

29:00.330 --> 29:02.366
No, a friend of his.
This guy, you know,

29:02.400 --> 29:04.300
he had all the details
figured out.

29:04.340 --> 29:07.059
Knew where to get the syrup,
how to get the boats,

29:07.110 --> 29:09.135
where to bring it
once it was on shore.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.047
He just needed a bunch
of guys to pull off the heist.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.445
So he brought it to Terrell.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.244
Terrell picked ten of us
and sent everybody else home.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.781
Just like that.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.287
No more Shoreline 99s.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.115
and for the last five years,

29:23.160 --> 29:25.253
we've been selling off
the syrup barrel by barrel.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.451
No more gang wars,
no more shootings.

29:27.490 --> 29:28.991
Best part is,

29:29.030 --> 29:31.419
syrup never
goes bad.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.994
Part of your plan
involved assaulting

29:33.030 --> 29:36.238
a warehouse security guard
named Connor Brunelle.

29:36.270 --> 29:37.430
Yeah, Terrell's friend
handled that part.

29:37.470 --> 29:39.335
Said he knew where
to find the guy,

29:39.370 --> 29:40.803
knew how to make sure he didn't

29:40.840 --> 29:42.307
show up for work.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.001
Terrell was sure
his friend could handle it.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.006
He told us this one story
where, supposedly,

29:46.050 --> 29:48.939
the guy got into a bar fight
and wound up taking down,

29:48.980 --> 29:51.141
like, four bouncers,
two Rottweilers,

29:51.190 --> 29:52.418
and half a dozen
other guys

29:52.450 --> 29:53.439
all by himself.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.151
He was a bruiser.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.555
Did this bruiser have a name?

29:56.590 --> 29:58.285
Terrell wouldn't tell us.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.321
Guy didn't want a bunch of thugs
being able to ID him

30:00.360 --> 30:01.588
just in case
something went wrong.

30:01.630 --> 30:02.949
That was part
of the deal.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.991
BELL: So Terrell Martin
is the only person

30:05.030 --> 30:07.965
who can identify
this silent partner,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.298
the man who assaulted
Connor Brunelle.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.409
So where is Terrell now?

30:11.440 --> 30:13.567
Groveton Cemetery.

30:13.610 --> 30:15.976
He died in a car crash
about a year ago.

30:18.380 --> 30:20.405
(siren wailing in distance)

30:25.350 --> 30:29.150
Ramesh is a friend
from med school.

30:29.190 --> 30:32.125
He specializes in Mohs
micrographic surgery.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.492
It's an advanced
technique

30:34.530 --> 30:36.919
to remove basal cell carcinoma.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.863
Listen, Jack.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.629
I'm not gonna pretend I know

30:41.670 --> 30:44.002
what it's like to lose a child.

30:44.040 --> 30:46.361
I've been around
plenty of people who have.

30:47.410 --> 30:50.174
I know it gets
better with time.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.475
However this thing turns out,
Ramesh can help you.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.383
40 minutes.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.464
Marcus!

31:21.480 --> 31:23.630
Hey.
August 23, 2009.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.148
A man is watching a hockey game
in a bar in Harlem.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.273
It is Montreal's Canadiens
against New York's Rangers.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.141
Midway through, three Ranger
fans start mocking our man,

31:31.190 --> 31:34.353
a Canadiens supporter,
over the poor play of his team.

31:34.390 --> 31:36.312
Alcohol is consumed,
threats are made.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.351
A confrontation begins.

31:38.390 --> 31:41.029
Our Canadiens fan battles
all three Ranger enthusiasts,

31:41.060 --> 31:43.654
as well as two bouncers,
a bartender, and a stray beagle

31:43.700 --> 31:44.962
that had wandered
into the bar.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.422
Oh, wait. Holmes, you...

31:46.470 --> 31:48.131
Terrell Martin's story
about his silent partner

31:48.170 --> 31:50.434
beating up a bar
all by himself is true.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.166
Or at least some version of it.
I began exploring the notion

31:53.210 --> 31:55.428
when I recalled the writings of
19th century Russian occultist

31:55.480 --> 31:56.674
Helena Blavatsky.

31:56.710 --> 32:00.043
To paraphrase:
no myth is wholesale fable.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.015
Even the most fanciful legends
begin as a small grain of truth.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.314
She was right,
and thankfully so, as her words

32:05.350 --> 32:06.988
_ have led us _
directly to our culprit.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.453
At the end of the confrontation,

32:08.490 --> 32:10.014
several of the belligerents
were arrested,

32:10.060 --> 32:12.028
including Terrell Martin's
silent partner.

32:12.060 --> 32:15.450
Or as we know him better,
Frank bloody Trimble.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.421
Look at these.

32:19.470 --> 32:23.395
Welts and bruises on Frank's
victims at the bar are identical

32:23.440 --> 32:26.136
to marks found on
Connor Brunelle.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.364
Same irregular shape

32:27.410 --> 32:28.570
of the first metacarpophalangeal
joint here.

32:28.610 --> 32:31.579
Same length
of the fourth metacarpal, here.

32:31.610 --> 32:34.113
Same distance between the major
and minor knuckles, here.

32:34.150 --> 32:36.744
These bruises were made
by the same hands.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.283
Frank Trimble's hands.
Frank is our culprit.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.050
He's the one
who assaulted Connor Brunelle.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.614
Uh...

32:43.660 --> 32:45.628
Sherlock,
that was the captain who called.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.685
It's 12:05.

32:47.730 --> 32:49.425
We missed the deadline.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.501
(phone ringing)

33:03.310 --> 33:05.346
It's Sherlock.

33:08.350 --> 33:09.544
Hey.

33:09.580 --> 33:12.549
HOLMES: You're unharmed?
So far, yes.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.309
Mr. Brunelle, it's over.
We've solved your case.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.715
Your son was assaulted
by a man named Frank Trimble.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.456
It doesn't matter anymore!

33:20.490 --> 33:24.096
It's past midnight. You failed.

33:24.130 --> 33:26.166
You need to give
us more time.
JACK: No.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.690
I gave you plenty of time.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.391
Years.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.101
I waited on you.

33:31.140 --> 33:32.732
Now you gonna wait on me.

33:37.780 --> 33:40.044
I know nothing's happened yet,
Tommy.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.469
The idea's to get my guys
inside before anything does.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.818
It's ten minutes
past the deadline

33:44.850 --> 33:47.080
and Jack Brunelle
hasn't fired a shot.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.348
You send a team
through that door,

33:48.390 --> 33:50.358
and that's gonna change
real quick.

33:50.390 --> 33:54.349
I send a team in, we're all
safe at home inside an hour.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.459
There are 20 hostages
inside that building.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.297
One of them is a friend of mine.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.661
If Brunelle doesn't
have a reason

33:59.700 --> 34:02.533
to kill anybody, I don't
want you giving him one.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.231
ESU OFFICER:
Hey, Captain.

34:04.270 --> 34:06.534
What?
There's something
you should see.

34:07.710 --> 34:08.836
ESU OFFICER:
The tablecloth came down

34:08.880 --> 34:10.677
a few minutes ago,

34:10.710 --> 34:13.201
but doesn't look like anybody
on the inside's noticed yet.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.775
Might give you a view
into the diner.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.447
Hold the entry.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.483
Get me a sniper.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.798
(grunting)
Come here.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.467
Get on the ground.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.536
Jack, what are you doing?
(hostages shouting)

34:39.570 --> 34:40.537
WATSON:
Jack, stop!

34:40.570 --> 34:42.174
I'm doing exactly what I said
I was gonna do.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.349
I've spent
hundreds of hours

34:44.380 --> 34:47.508
trying to get police
to look at Connor's case.

34:47.550 --> 34:49.768
I wrote letters.
I printed flyers.

34:49.820 --> 34:53.517
I even posted online.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.154
None of it made a difference.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.487
So, you tell me, Joan,

34:56.520 --> 34:59.455
what am I supposed to do?

34:59.490 --> 35:01.196
Do you really think that
Connor would want you

35:01.230 --> 35:02.197
to kill an innocent man?

35:02.230 --> 35:03.492
He's not innocent!

35:03.530 --> 35:05.361
Connor was lying

35:05.400 --> 35:07.459
in a hospital bed, half dead,

35:07.500 --> 35:08.660
while he did nothing.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.463
(groans)
Don't! Please!

35:14.610 --> 35:17.579
That makes him pretty guilty
in my book.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.601
(cell phone vibrating)

35:25.520 --> 35:29.479
Guilty of being a bad cop.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.420
Okay? Yes.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.552
But that does not earn him

35:32.590 --> 35:33.921
a death sentence.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.656
You know that, Jack.
I don't know anything.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.827
Stop telling me
what I'm thinking!

35:42.400 --> 35:46.200
However angry that you are

35:46.240 --> 35:48.276
about what happened to your son,

35:48.310 --> 35:52.804
you're not gonna feel better
by killing this man. Okay?

35:52.850 --> 35:56.638
Stop moving, Jack.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.817
If you take another step,

35:57.850 --> 35:59.681
a sniper outside
will blow your head off.

36:09.830 --> 36:13.425
I am really sorry...

36:13.470 --> 36:14.892
(choked up):
...about how your son died.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.669
I really am.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.464
But you know...

36:20.740 --> 36:24.574
...that this is no way
to honor his memory.

36:35.660 --> 36:39.289
You just saved my life.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.298
Put the gun down.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.264
Please.

36:54.310 --> 36:56.301
(indistinct chatter)

37:06.750 --> 37:09.685
GREGSON:
You okay?

37:09.720 --> 37:11.585
Not really.

37:13.830 --> 37:16.856
You did good in there.

37:35.050 --> 37:36.915
Can't sleep?

37:37.950 --> 37:40.817
Apparently, you can't, either.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.557
What's all this?

37:43.590 --> 37:45.455
Oh, I'm, uh, reexamining
the paperwork

37:45.490 --> 37:47.287
on the Connor
Brunelle assault.

37:47.330 --> 37:49.855
Why? Jack Brunelle is in jail.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.868
We know that Frank Trimble
assaulted his son,

37:51.900 --> 37:53.663
but the statute of limitations
has expired. It's over.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.692
And yet I find myself
drawn to this case

37:56.740 --> 37:59.368
for the uniquely challenging foe
it presents.

37:59.410 --> 38:02.868
How is Frank Trimble
a "uniquely challenging foe"?

38:02.910 --> 38:05.743
He's not. I'm referring
to time itself.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.702
Oh.
As rivals go,

38:07.750 --> 38:09.342
it's undefeated.

38:10.980 --> 38:12.948
I just want you to know
that if you tell me

38:12.990 --> 38:16.050
you're trying to build a flux
capacitor, I'm out of here.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.681
Good night, Sherlock.

38:20.730 --> 38:23.654
Good night, Watson.

38:29.070 --> 38:30.094
WATSON:
What's that?

38:30.140 --> 38:31.698
You're gonna need it later on.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.470
I told you last night,
as adversaries go,

38:34.510 --> 38:37.399
time itself
was undefeated...

38:37.440 --> 38:39.647
but as of this morning, you
can consider it defeated.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.046
I have scaled an
unscalable peak.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.968
My ascent, however,

38:44.020 --> 38:47.012
_ was not_without
its metaphorical Sherpas.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.983
I'm gonna take a wild guess,

38:53.030 --> 38:55.521
and say that you got some help
from Everyone.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.720
They were kind enough
to lend their assistance

38:56.760 --> 39:00.799
on spec last night,
but when we are finished

39:00.830 --> 39:03.799
arresting Frank Trimble for
his assault on Connor Brunelle,

39:03.840 --> 39:06.001
we are going to have
to pay the piper.

39:06.040 --> 39:09.009
How are we going
to arrest Frank Trimble?

39:09.040 --> 39:11.406
Statute of limitations
has expired.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.077
Hmm.

39:13.110 --> 39:15.908
What did Everyone do for you?

39:18.120 --> 39:21.578
(speaking French)

39:21.620 --> 39:23.815
HOLMES:
There. That's you, Mr. Trimble,

39:23.860 --> 39:26.749
at a Montreal Canadiens
playoff game

39:26.790 --> 39:28.826
two and a half years ago.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.999
Some tech-savvy friends
of mine found this footage

39:31.030 --> 39:32.998
using facial recognition
sobeare.

39:33.030 --> 39:35.134
So yes, as I was looking
through the details

39:35.170 --> 39:37.138
of your personal life,
I discovered

39:37.170 --> 39:40.799
you're not just a hockey fan,
you are... you're a devotee.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.776
You live and die the fortunes
of les Habs and...

39:44.810 --> 39:46.175
well, you went
to attend a game

39:46.210 --> 39:48.815
at the mecca
of French Canadian hockey.

39:48.850 --> 39:51.148
WATSON:
We pulled your credit card
statements this morning.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.512
You bought last-minute
tickets online.

39:53.550 --> 39:54.756
You drove up
on a Friday,

39:54.790 --> 39:56.087
you stayed overnight in a hotel,

39:56.120 --> 39:58.111
and you drove back on Saturday.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.650
So?

39:59.690 --> 40:01.157
BELL:
So the Canadiens play

40:01.190 --> 40:03.795
in Canada, which means you
crossed an international border

40:03.830 --> 40:05.161
to get to the game.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.827
(chuckles):
So?

40:06.870 --> 40:09.634
GREGSON: Have you heard
of tolling, Mr. Trimble?

40:09.670 --> 40:10.989
It's a legal term.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.133
When a crime is committed...

40:13.170 --> 40:14.774
Assault, for example.

40:14.810 --> 40:17.131
...the statute of limitations
on that crime begins

40:17.180 --> 40:19.978
the moment it is reported
and continues to count down

40:20.010 --> 40:22.046
until the time expires.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.672
WATSON:
Unless you leave
the country,

40:23.720 --> 40:24.880
in which case the clock stops

40:24.920 --> 40:26.717
for the time that you're away.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.115
That time is "tolled."

40:28.150 --> 40:29.856
BELL: Tolling
stops people

40:29.890 --> 40:31.118
from committing a crime,
leaving the country,

40:31.160 --> 40:32.718
then returning scot-free

40:32.760 --> 40:34.853
after the statute _of limitations
has expired.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.856
Without it,
people could commit a crime

40:36.900 --> 40:38.822
without any repercussions.
WATSON: When you went

40:38.870 --> 40:41.225
to that game, you left
the country for 27 hours.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.568
So that means
the statute of limitations

40:43.600 --> 40:45.739
for the assault you committed
against Connor Brunelle

40:45.770 --> 40:49.706
five years ago is still active
for exactly that amount of time.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.207
BELL:
We can match the
bruises you left

40:51.240 --> 40:53.242
on those guys in Harlem
after the bar fight

40:53.280 --> 40:55.168
with the ones you left
on Connor Brunelle.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.643
In other words,
you're under arrest.

40:58.850 --> 41:01.887
HOLMES: And if you're still
unclear about the concept

41:01.920 --> 41:04.627
of tolling, don't worry,
because the 20-odd years

41:04.660 --> 41:06.878
you might get
for criminal assault
in the first degree

41:06.930 --> 41:10.127
should give you plenty of time
to work it out.

41:14.170 --> 41:17.264
* Tropics...

41:17.300 --> 41:19.939
So, are we doing this?

41:19.970 --> 41:21.528
We are.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.979
Your phone rang.

41:23.010 --> 41:24.898
Yeah, it was the captain.
He spoke to his friend

41:24.950 --> 41:26.975
at the Department of
Corrections this morning.

41:27.010 --> 41:28.910
They agreed
to let Ramesh

41:28.950 --> 41:31.248
treat Jack'_s cancer
while he's in prison.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.248
So he's gonna get
the surgery he needs.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.110
(phone chimes)
Hmm.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.980
Everyone?

41:37.020 --> 41:39.284
Yes. They're ready.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.855
Here's what
I don't get.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.094
I mean, you could
shave your own head,

41:43.130 --> 41:45.098
so why do I have to do it?
Mm...

41:45.130 --> 41:48.167
partners in everything,
I suppose, Watson.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.532
Okay, this is
your last chance...
(exhales)

41:50.570 --> 41:52.106
...to get out of it.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.973
The humiliation will fade.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.978
The satisfaction of putting
Frank Trimble

41:57.010 --> 41:58.978
behind bars will not.

41:59.010 --> 42:01.649
Now, let's get on with it.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.875
* Window to another world

42:08.720 --> 42:12.827
* Mmm, tropics...

42:12.860 --> 42:15.954
* Off the map

42:16.000 --> 42:19.128
* Through the glass ceiling

42:19.170 --> 42:20.967
* On the right path...

42:21.000 --> 42:22.991
