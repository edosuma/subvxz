WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:03.253
The festival's a few days' walk.

00:03.337 --> 00:06.215
Kofun. We're going to see the world.

00:06.673 --> 00:10.177
Behold! We have brought witches to burn.

00:10.260 --> 00:14.348
The Witchfinder has missed us,
but his message has traveled.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.849
<i>Where's Kofun?</i>

00:15.933 --> 00:18.519
Help! Haniwa!

00:19.061 --> 00:22.022
-Kofun has written a message.
-How do you know those words?

00:22.105 --> 00:23.690
It's knowledge from the box, Mama.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.318
We opened it.
We have learned to read and write.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.778
And we read all the books he left behind.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.031
Your boy!

00:35.285 --> 00:36.286
<i>A message.</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:39.456
<i>It will flow downstream
through a dozen different valleys.</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.917
News from the Sun Grave, Your Majesty.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.418
It's not over.

01:43.970 --> 01:44.971
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

01:52.062 --> 01:53.146
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

02:50.036 --> 02:52.372
They have come for the witches at last!

02:52.789 --> 02:54.583
Before we came here,

02:54.666 --> 02:57.753
we had a chance to give the witches up,

02:58.170 --> 03:00.005
but they enchanted you all.

03:00.422 --> 03:02.591
Now is your moment to repent.

03:02.674 --> 03:04.426
Let us rid ourselves of them!

03:04.885 --> 03:08.472
They are the ones to blame
for the danger we are facing today,

03:08.555 --> 03:10.849
and they must answer for it!

03:10.932 --> 03:12.851
Everyone knows

03:12.934 --> 03:13.935
To the river...

03:14.019 --> 03:16.605
that you have been our true enemy
this whole time!

03:17.481 --> 03:19.274
Hold them! Don't let them go!

03:19.858 --> 03:21.526
Do not let them leave!

03:21.610 --> 03:24.279
We will use them
as a bargain for our lives.

03:24.362 --> 03:25.947
I have him! I have him!

03:26.031 --> 03:30.243
Stand back!
The witch has me by the throat!

03:30.327 --> 03:31.536
We have to leave now.

03:31.620 --> 03:32.996
Get them to the river. To the river.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.916
-Let the devils pass!
-Arca!

03:35.999 --> 03:37.667
We'll be rid of them soon enough!

03:37.751 --> 03:38.752
Matal!

03:40.337 --> 03:41.380
Go.

03:42.881 --> 03:45.133
Go with them. Live.

03:45.217 --> 03:46.218
I love you.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.652
Matal.

04:08.740 --> 04:09.908
What is she doing?

04:11.451 --> 04:12.661
Bow?

04:12.744 --> 04:13.995
I'm coming with you.

04:14.496 --> 04:15.914
Come with me! Follow!

04:17.457 --> 04:18.458
Kofun.

04:20.919 --> 04:22.587
You have no use for me.

04:23.505 --> 04:24.548
Let me go.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.550
He deserves to die.

04:27.384 --> 04:28.385
No.

04:30.679 --> 04:31.680
No.

04:34.975 --> 04:38.520
If I were a devil for real,
I would take great pleasure.

04:44.943 --> 04:46.695
But we're not that kind of tribe.

05:45.253 --> 05:47.297
I am Tamacti Jun.

05:49.174 --> 05:55.138
Witchfinder General for Queen Kane
and the Holy Guardians of the Payan.

05:55.222 --> 05:59.684
At last, Witchfinder,
you have come to save us.

06:00.352 --> 06:01.812
On your knees.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.397
What?

06:05.982 --> 06:06.983
All of you.

06:20.872 --> 06:22.332
For your lives...

06:23.583 --> 06:26.294
give up the children of Jerlamarel.

06:28.839 --> 06:30.716
We Alkenny are good people.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.177
Quiet people.

06:36.012 --> 06:37.264
Please...

06:38.765 --> 06:41.768
Witchfinder, please.

06:43.228 --> 06:45.188
The witches are gone.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.321
Until proven otherwise...

06:54.990 --> 06:56.533
you're all witches.

06:58.076 --> 06:59.536
Holy Guardian!

07:00.829 --> 07:02.497
This is Gether Bax!

07:03.373 --> 07:05.667
The witches, they've run!

07:06.710 --> 07:07.878
Follow me!

07:13.925 --> 07:15.052
Wait. It's a dead end.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.513
No, my boy. This is where we descend.

07:23.810 --> 07:24.811
Look.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.274
Dad.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.986
You did this? Alone?

07:33.528 --> 07:36.114
Anything Jerlamarel can do,
I can do, only bigger.

07:36.198 --> 07:38.200
What is it? What's below us?

07:38.617 --> 07:40.035
Freedom, Mama.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.664
Dad built a boat.

07:48.460 --> 07:49.461
Son.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.256
When did you do this?

07:53.840 --> 07:55.050
When I could.

07:55.133 --> 07:56.760
You'd be surprised
how much you can accomplish

07:56.843 --> 07:58.804
before your eyes even get open
in the morning.

07:59.971 --> 08:00.972
Why?

08:02.265 --> 08:04.810
Like you,
I hoped this day would never come.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.562
But you prepared for it?

08:08.730 --> 08:12.067
Yes, I did. And because of it,
we will live to see tomorrow.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.234
The ones that fled...

08:55.360 --> 08:57.070
was one of them a builder?

08:57.487 --> 09:00.031
Yes. Yes, a very skilled one.

09:04.035 --> 09:05.245
Cross.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.067
-Dad.
-I know. I can hear them.

10:19.403 --> 10:20.987
Give me my sword.

10:40.716 --> 10:44.720
They are ahead. Both sides.

10:46.555 --> 10:49.725
We travel silently.

11:32.642 --> 11:34.770
I have been looking for you...

11:36.855 --> 11:38.523
for a lifetime.

11:43.653 --> 11:46.364
I was there when you were born.

11:52.704 --> 11:54.748
I heard your first cries.

11:58.001 --> 12:03.590
And ever since, I have devoted my life
to finding you again.

12:08.345 --> 12:14.267
I have laid waste to so many lives
to reach you.

12:16.686 --> 12:17.938
And now...

12:20.357 --> 12:21.858
what next?

12:23.819 --> 12:27.155
Nearby, there's a village
filled with your kinsmen

12:27.239 --> 12:31.034
all on their knees
begging for my forgiveness.

12:33.912 --> 12:36.706
Perhaps you can purchase it for them.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.461
Speak.

12:44.673 --> 12:46.967
Let me hear the sound of your voices

12:47.050 --> 12:50.095
for the first time
since they were newborn wails.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.933
Announce yourselves.

12:57.269 --> 13:00.313
And let me escort you to meet your queen.

13:03.859 --> 13:05.235
Do it...

13:07.028 --> 13:08.905
and the village lives.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.375
No?

14:37.327 --> 14:38.328
Help!

14:45.460 --> 14:46.461
No!

15:00.475 --> 15:02.185
-Baba!
-Maghra.

15:15.782 --> 15:16.783
Wait, Mama.

15:32.424 --> 15:33.467
No!

15:36.470 --> 15:37.512
Mom!

15:57.783 --> 15:58.784
Go!

16:07.167 --> 16:08.376
Arca!

16:36.655 --> 16:38.323
What lies downriver?

16:39.282 --> 16:40.534
Can we pursue?

16:41.868 --> 16:43.370
I've been run through.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.125
What lies ahead?

16:50.043 --> 16:53.004
Perhaps you can be saved.

16:53.964 --> 16:56.007
Open waters, deep water.

16:56.717 --> 16:57.884
They'll move quickly.

16:58.552 --> 17:00.721
You will not be able to catch them.

17:02.347 --> 17:03.515
Help me.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.446
There. That should save you some time.

17:20.949 --> 17:23.952
Return to the village. Kill them all.

17:27.122 --> 17:28.123
Herald.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.295
Message for Queen Kane.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.673
The witches have escaped.

18:36.441 --> 18:37.901
Tamacti Jun sends news.

18:39.236 --> 18:40.695
Did he locate the witches?

18:40.779 --> 18:43.407
Yes. But, for the moment,
they escaped him.

18:44.408 --> 18:45.951
They escaped him again?

18:47.661 --> 18:49.663
-How?
-He doesn't say.

18:51.081 --> 18:52.791
So we must guess,

18:53.208 --> 18:55.752
or invent for ourselves.

18:55.836 --> 18:57.170
Lady An,

18:57.921 --> 19:03.009
when the God Flame burns our skin,
do you blame God or yourself?

19:04.344 --> 19:05.846
Neither one, my queen.

19:06.930 --> 19:09.307
I blame my maid for not shading me.

19:10.642 --> 19:14.062
Gods are not blamed.
No one is blaming you.

19:15.605 --> 19:18.775
But perhaps this news means
Tamacti Jun should return home.

19:19.443 --> 19:21.194
No.

19:21.486 --> 19:25.490
But to undertake such a journey,
Tamacti Jun will need more soldiers.

19:25.824 --> 19:27.075
Majesty, please--

19:27.159 --> 19:29.828
Send more. Send all of them.

19:29.911 --> 19:32.205
These are fathers and mothers,

19:32.289 --> 19:33.832
husbands and wives,

19:34.291 --> 19:35.834
daughters and sons.

19:36.626 --> 19:39.504
Their families have suffered
their absences.

19:39.588 --> 19:43.633
They are tired of this...
fruitless crusade.

19:43.717 --> 19:45.719
It's beyond their understanding.

19:46.803 --> 19:49.973
The holy machines are groaning too,
Your Majesty.

19:51.308 --> 19:53.560
The gods themselves
do not understand this.

19:53.643 --> 19:56.646
But you understand
what the gods are saying?

19:56.730 --> 20:00.525
Yes! They are saying "enough!" Enough!

20:05.155 --> 20:06.156
There...

20:08.492 --> 20:10.577
in our ancient constitution.

20:16.374 --> 20:18.960
"And the monarch
shall rule the parliament,

20:20.712 --> 20:22.756
and the monarch shall rule until death."

20:22.839 --> 20:24.341
I'm not feeling unwell.

20:24.424 --> 20:29.012
Majesty,
here is what the people of Payan say.

20:29.096 --> 20:31.556
As you fuck them like prayer mats.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.852
Plainly, simply, you have
chased the witches for a generation.

20:35.936 --> 20:37.771
Yet none has been found.

20:38.313 --> 20:40.232
You have sacrificed our army,

20:40.732 --> 20:42.692
emptied our treasure houses.

20:42.776 --> 20:47.280
Still there is no proof of evil power.

20:49.199 --> 20:50.200
Just...

20:51.952 --> 20:55.163
a man you once loved
who ran away from you.

20:59.042 --> 21:05.173
They say we are a nation
governed by a broken heart.

22:26.505 --> 22:28.215
A message from Jerlamarel.

22:30.592 --> 22:35.389
A message to present to the children
once they were ready to leave us behind.

22:36.765 --> 22:38.016
It is a message for eyes.

22:41.061 --> 22:43.021
More surprises from Jerlamarel?

22:46.108 --> 22:47.818
I gave him my word.

22:47.901 --> 22:51.696
I would present it no sooner
than when they were ready for it.

22:52.906 --> 22:55.283
It's the last of my messages from him.

22:56.368 --> 22:59.454
Last of my promises to him.

22:59.955 --> 23:01.039
Are we sure?

23:02.833 --> 23:04.167
Yes, we are.

23:05.919 --> 23:06.920
Go ahead.

23:12.843 --> 23:14.594
"My dear children...

23:17.514 --> 23:19.349
the river is the beginning.

23:20.726 --> 23:23.812
The first step of your long journey
back to me.

23:24.688 --> 23:27.899
Follow the river to the lavender.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.277
The great lavender road."

23:30.986 --> 23:32.654
The lavender road is real.

23:33.405 --> 23:37.325
"Then follow the lavender road
to the House of Enlightenment.

23:39.369 --> 23:41.913
There, I will build a new kingdom.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.417
A bright shining light
in a world of darkness.

23:45.876 --> 23:49.129
And one day, you will come to me
and know what I know.

23:49.921 --> 23:53.592
And carry this knowledge forward
to the darkest corners of the earth."

23:56.219 --> 23:58.346
-"Those with eyes to see must follow me."
-"...see must follow me."

24:03.685 --> 24:07.439
So, what? We just follow the river?
For how long?

24:09.191 --> 24:10.525
He'll leave us signs.

24:13.528 --> 24:15.447
-We'll make it.
-Will we?

24:15.864 --> 24:17.365
What other choice do we have?

24:17.449 --> 24:18.784
We have a choice.

24:22.454 --> 24:23.538
Listen to me.

24:25.791 --> 24:27.042
Look at me.

24:38.637 --> 24:40.472
The longer the journey,

24:41.306 --> 24:44.267
the more profound its challenges,

24:44.768 --> 24:48.146
the more it changes all who endure it.

24:51.066 --> 24:52.776
A journey like this one...

24:57.489 --> 24:59.032
Those of us who could survive it,

24:59.116 --> 25:03.328
I fear, would emerge on the other end
of it unrecognizable to each other.

25:20.178 --> 25:22.973
What kind of answers
will the House of Enlightenment provide

25:23.056 --> 25:27.018
to any of us
if we no longer recognize ourselves?

25:34.151 --> 25:38.989
I will abide to whatever our vote decides,
but you must hear this.

25:40.866 --> 25:45.454
We have a choice to live as we are.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.789
We can gain some distance
on the Witchfinder,

25:47.873 --> 25:50.792
who most certainly continues his pursuit
as we speak.

25:52.210 --> 25:55.756
And we can move far away
from anywhere he might track us...

25:57.174 --> 26:02.554
and live our lives simply, and quietly,

26:03.346 --> 26:04.598
and together.

26:12.481 --> 26:19.237
Mama, I don't know that I can ever know
who I really am

26:19.988 --> 26:21.948
until I know where I came from.

26:25.160 --> 26:29.539
And I can't know that
until I know Jerlamarel.

26:35.796 --> 26:36.880
And you?

26:40.008 --> 26:44.179
I don't think I'm meant to be someone
who hides from the world.

26:45.222 --> 26:47.891
I don't think I want to be someone
who ignores the truth

26:47.974 --> 26:49.893
because I'm afraid of what it might mean.

26:54.648 --> 26:55.649
I see.

27:00.112 --> 27:01.530
Shall we take the vote?

27:03.824 --> 27:06.410
All those in favor of leaving the river
and finding shelter.

27:06.827 --> 27:07.828
Chet-chet.

27:08.829 --> 27:09.830
Chet-chet.

27:12.624 --> 27:15.627
All those in favor of following the trail
of Jerlamarel.

27:15.710 --> 27:17.254
-Chet-chet.
-Chet-chet.

27:18.714 --> 27:19.798
Chet-chet.

27:24.052 --> 27:26.054
There's still one vote left to be cast.

27:30.976 --> 27:33.103
-No.
-We are one tribe, Haniwa.

27:33.186 --> 27:34.813
We are one tribe.

27:35.689 --> 27:36.690
We.

27:37.607 --> 27:40.527
The ones who have been in this together
from the beginning.

27:40.944 --> 27:42.362
I agree with Paris.

27:42.779 --> 27:45.198
Right now we are all that remain
of the Alkenny,

27:45.282 --> 27:47.367
and Bow Lion shares that connection.

27:47.451 --> 27:50.078
The Alkenny were willing to hand us over
to the Witchfinder

27:50.162 --> 27:51.621
in order to save themselves.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.957
They did what they did.

27:54.708 --> 27:57.627
But they also taught you, they fed you,

27:58.086 --> 27:59.921
they loved you, and befriended you.

28:01.256 --> 28:03.884
They uprooted their lives to save yours.

28:03.967 --> 28:06.636
And the very first chance they got,
they betrayed us all.

28:08.346 --> 28:10.682
There are six of us on this boat,
and everyone will be heard.

28:10.766 --> 28:11.767
No.

28:13.935 --> 28:16.772
She has absolutely nothing to do
with this.

28:16.855 --> 28:17.939
Haniwa.

28:19.816 --> 28:21.526
I vote to follow the river.

28:25.739 --> 28:27.908
I vote with Haniwa and Kofun.

28:29.159 --> 28:32.662
Arca, Matal, my mother...

28:34.748 --> 28:37.209
We've sacrificed too much to stop now.

28:39.336 --> 28:41.463
Then we have decided.

28:53.266 --> 28:54.267
General!

28:54.768 --> 28:55.894
Report.

28:56.353 --> 28:57.604
Good news, General.

28:58.021 --> 29:00.607
We believe the terrain ahead
is treacherous but may be passable.

29:00.690 --> 29:04.069
The column needn't be camped for more
than a half day while we scout it out.

29:04.152 --> 29:07.489
No one's stopping
until either we're all dead

29:07.572 --> 29:11.159
or we find the children of Jerlamarel.
Understood?

29:12.035 --> 29:13.787
-Understood.
-Good.

29:14.329 --> 29:15.747
So move!

29:22.921 --> 29:25.006
Then it must be done to kill the queen.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.091
A god?

29:26.174 --> 29:27.718
Who here still believes that?

29:27.801 --> 29:29.720
What we believe is not important.

29:29.803 --> 29:32.264
Many of the people of the lower walls
still believe it.

29:32.347 --> 29:37.144
-If we deposed--
-Deposed their god, they would rise up.

29:37.227 --> 29:39.312
-We have soldiers.
-So few.

29:39.396 --> 29:42.107
Then we must not be the ones
to depose her.

29:42.190 --> 29:45.610
If even we fear to do it,
who else possibly would?

29:46.611 --> 29:49.030
To kill a god, one must enlist a god.

29:50.449 --> 29:54.202
Her death must involve no struggle,
no blood, no weapon.

29:54.619 --> 29:57.706
No evidence of human hand whatsoever.

29:58.999 --> 30:00.876
And then the people from the lower wall

30:00.959 --> 30:05.881
will hear that their queen was struck down
by divine intervention.

30:07.049 --> 30:10.802
And they will say, "This is justice."

30:30.447 --> 30:31.865
I'm too merciful.

30:39.831 --> 30:41.166
We could pray.

30:44.961 --> 30:46.755
I pray only for the truth.

30:49.049 --> 30:50.467
What do you hear?

30:52.427 --> 30:54.388
There are new whispers about you.

30:56.098 --> 30:59.226
Who whispers? Lady An? Lord Dune?

31:00.602 --> 31:02.229
Yes, and others.

31:04.856 --> 31:06.066
Give me names.

31:09.486 --> 31:12.155
All of them, my queen.

31:48.442 --> 31:51.236
-Why did you do that?
-Do what?

31:52.362 --> 31:54.573
You have no reason to go
where we're going.

31:54.656 --> 31:56.825
If you voted against us,
you wouldn't have to.

31:58.952 --> 31:59.995
They're gone.

32:01.955 --> 32:03.623
Everyone's gone.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.043
Where else am I gonna go?

32:10.255 --> 32:14.092
Still. Still you chose the harder path.

32:14.509 --> 32:18.013
The more dangerous one. But why?

32:20.390 --> 32:22.642
I don't know you and your sister
very well.

32:23.602 --> 32:26.063
Not like I knew the others in the village.

32:27.689 --> 32:30.275
Because we were the only ones
you couldn't spy on.

32:31.359 --> 32:33.278
I know you're a shadow.

32:35.447 --> 32:37.449
I may not know all your secrets...

32:38.950 --> 32:41.745
but your sister's anger
has never been a secret to anyone.

32:43.955 --> 32:45.707
I voted that way because...

32:47.125 --> 32:50.837
I don't know what difference it makes,
and I'm done fighting for today.

32:53.465 --> 32:55.759
She isn't angry.

32:56.301 --> 32:58.345
I mean, she isn't angry with you.

33:00.013 --> 33:05.185
Look, this is just a lot for her,
and she's trying her best.

33:05.268 --> 33:07.771
And sometimes that comes out as anger.

33:13.693 --> 33:15.320
Isn't it hard for you too?

33:26.623 --> 33:29.918
Thank you for trying to speak to me.

33:32.713 --> 33:34.548
I'd like to be alone now.

33:47.894 --> 33:49.271
Hey, do you need help?

33:49.896 --> 33:52.274
Yes. I made these.

33:52.899 --> 33:54.901
-To give to Bow.
-Okay.

33:55.318 --> 33:56.570
For you and Haniwa.

33:57.988 --> 33:59.614
We need to stop for the night.

34:00.615 --> 34:02.784
She needs to rest by a fire.

34:08.290 --> 34:09.291
Yes.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.130
Are you all right?

34:22.304 --> 34:24.347
She's never spoken to me that way before.

34:25.599 --> 34:27.350
Argued with me, yes.

34:27.434 --> 34:30.187
Defied me many times, but...

34:33.523 --> 34:35.984
this was just something so different.

34:40.489 --> 34:44.618
If the vote had been a tie
and I'd broken that tie against her,

34:45.202 --> 34:47.412
I honestly don't know
what she would have done.

34:52.626 --> 34:55.837
We told them to hide who they were
their whole lives.

34:57.714 --> 35:01.385
Told them it wasn't safe
for anyone to know.

35:03.845 --> 35:08.100
We never really knew
who they were supposed to be.

35:09.935 --> 35:11.560
How could they?

35:14.189 --> 35:17.150
Maybe the further up this river we go...

35:18.276 --> 35:21.154
the freer they'll be to find out.

35:57.691 --> 36:02.696
Your Majesty?
Your handmaiden delivered my invitation?

36:03.196 --> 36:05.323
Indeed, she did, Lady An. Indeed, she did.

36:05.407 --> 36:08.118
Your Majesty, welcome.

36:22.174 --> 36:25.052
The smell of sex
and the sound of songbirds.

36:25.719 --> 36:27.262
The divine combination.

36:27.929 --> 36:29.473
And as I told you in my invitation,

36:29.556 --> 36:32.142
I have a special pleasure in store
for you.

36:35.437 --> 36:37.272
Everyone not invited, leave now.

36:46.114 --> 36:49.326
A new song. A new bird.

36:50.327 --> 36:52.954
You will be the first to hear it
inside the palace walls.

36:55.332 --> 36:57.417
And who will stay to share my delight?

36:59.086 --> 37:00.879
It is I, Your Majesty.

37:02.047 --> 37:03.048
With your permission.

37:03.131 --> 37:06.093
Of course, Lord Dune. I know it'd be you.

37:07.010 --> 37:12.391
We think the strange new bird
has been blown off course by a storm.

37:13.725 --> 37:18.397
My net man heard it singing
in the apple trees and managed to trap it.

37:19.981 --> 37:21.900
Well, then that man will be rewarded.

37:22.526 --> 37:25.445
As will you, Lady An.
And you, Lord Dune, for thinking of me.

37:26.530 --> 37:28.115
And here is our new guest.

37:38.834 --> 37:40.377
I don't hear a song.

37:40.460 --> 37:46.049
I'm told this particular bird
only sings when you take it in your hand.

37:47.718 --> 37:49.970
Yours will be the first hand to hold it.

37:52.222 --> 37:53.390
Well...

37:53.473 --> 37:56.601
then open the door of the cage, Lord Dune.

38:09.823 --> 38:12.909
Birds usually tremble among people.
I don't hear it tremble.

38:13.201 --> 38:16.413
Perhaps it's not afraid.

38:25.714 --> 38:27.340
And I am not afraid.

38:27.424 --> 38:31.303
You see, my whole entire parliament
agreeing to my death,

38:31.386 --> 38:33.638
this whole rotten city wanting me to die.

38:33.722 --> 38:38.393
I've decided I won't die for this city.
This city will die for me.

38:41.897 --> 38:43.106
You can go first.

38:58.038 --> 38:59.039
Okay.

39:08.173 --> 39:09.674
We've traveled a good distance.

39:10.258 --> 39:13.720
As long as we keep moving by daybreak,
we should be fine.

39:13.804 --> 39:17.808
One of us should stay awake through
the night to keep watch and tend the fire.

39:22.521 --> 39:23.730
Sit with me.

39:38.703 --> 39:39.746
Mama...

39:39.830 --> 39:43.625
Tell me.
What do you imagine it will be like?

39:51.633 --> 39:53.093
What will what be like?

39:53.802 --> 39:56.972
"There, I'll build my kingdom," he says.

39:59.349 --> 40:02.686
We're all gonna risk life and limb
to get to this place.

40:03.437 --> 40:04.730
So, tell me.

40:05.897 --> 40:08.650
What do you imagine
this kingdom will be like?

40:14.322 --> 40:15.490
Well...

40:22.497 --> 40:23.915
I imagine...

40:26.084 --> 40:31.590
it will be... a place
where we'll remember things.

40:33.675 --> 40:36.219
About what things were like for us once.

40:38.346 --> 40:40.098
About who we used to be.

40:42.517 --> 40:43.560
About...

40:45.395 --> 40:48.356
how to use that knowledge
to make things better now.

40:52.402 --> 40:53.820
I imagine...

40:55.447 --> 40:57.574
it will be a place where...

40:59.367 --> 41:01.578
I won't be the strange one anymore.

41:04.414 --> 41:07.292
Where I can help
to build something important...

41:08.335 --> 41:11.004
and do it without having to hide who I am.

41:14.758 --> 41:18.011
If your father builds himself a kingdom,
you would be its princess.

41:22.724 --> 41:24.267
It's not like that.

41:25.102 --> 41:28.146
I would do whatever he asked me to do.
However I could help.

41:28.230 --> 41:30.816
And who would I be in this kingdom?

41:32.526 --> 41:34.027
You'd be its queen.

41:38.490 --> 41:39.950
I don't think so.

41:41.576 --> 41:43.495
A king with vision...

41:44.663 --> 41:47.416
a prince and princess with vision.

41:48.792 --> 41:50.460
I'd be the one without.

41:52.963 --> 41:54.840
I'll be the strange one.

41:56.425 --> 41:58.135
The one they say is weak.

41:58.218 --> 42:00.303
I would never let anyone say that.

42:00.637 --> 42:02.097
I know you wouldn't.

42:06.643 --> 42:11.440
It is important for me
to reach this place.

42:12.524 --> 42:14.443
But it's not about me.

42:15.527 --> 42:17.154
It's about all of us.

42:19.740 --> 42:23.034
We'll all be better off there.
I really believe that.

42:32.711 --> 42:34.296
We should all rest awhile.

42:36.423 --> 42:37.466
Okay.

44:23.488 --> 44:25.782
Kofun, my sword is missing.

44:25.866 --> 44:27.200
My bow's gone, too.

44:27.784 --> 44:29.578
-Maghra.
-Bow, check the boat.

44:29.661 --> 44:31.079
-Chet-chet.
-Maghra.

44:31.163 --> 44:33.331
-I thought one of you was awake all night.
-Come.

44:33.415 --> 44:34.624
-We were.
-Come.

44:34.708 --> 44:36.084
Then how did this happen?

44:36.543 --> 44:38.920
Someone walked all through our camp,
woke none of us,

44:39.004 --> 44:41.214
-and was seen by neither of you?
-I don't know.

44:42.340 --> 44:44.051
It's all gone now, isn't it?

44:45.052 --> 44:47.429
-Help me. We need to go.
-Okay. Now walk.

44:47.512 --> 44:48.638
We can't leave.

44:48.722 --> 44:49.973
We must.

44:51.016 --> 44:54.478
All that was taken was weapons.
It's nothing irreplaceable.

44:54.561 --> 44:56.354
-I'm missing something.
-Come.

44:57.147 --> 44:58.231
What are you missing?

44:58.315 --> 45:02.235
It's a small pouch. It's soft.
Size of a fist.

45:02.319 --> 45:03.695
What is in the pouch?

45:03.779 --> 45:07.365
Something very important to me.
The only thing I have left of my father.

45:07.449 --> 45:10.118
-My only connection to him. It's...
-Okay.

45:10.202 --> 45:13.914
It's irreplaceable! We have to find out
where it went. We have to get it back.

45:13.997 --> 45:16.583
-But, Mom, what is it?
-It's important.

45:18.126 --> 45:19.836
Maghra, listen--

45:19.920 --> 45:21.380
Please can you just--

45:21.463 --> 45:24.549
Don't ask me to say anything more.
Just help me find it.

45:26.176 --> 45:29.012
My love, we are unarmed.

45:29.721 --> 45:32.516
Whoever came last night may return.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.976
And the Witchfinder lurks out there
somewhere.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.812
If we remain too long, he will find us.

45:36.895 --> 45:38.480
Then we must hurry.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.778
My father, my relationship with him
is not something I know how to talk about.

45:44.861 --> 45:46.113
It's complicated.

45:46.571 --> 45:49.074
And, of all people,
I would think you would understand.

45:56.581 --> 46:00.794
Whatever secrets I have kept from you
has been to protect us.

46:01.336 --> 46:04.715
Whatever secrets you have kept from me
has always been to protect us.

46:06.508 --> 46:08.135
Please help me understand this.

46:08.802 --> 46:13.056
Help me justify putting our children
in danger right now because I cannot.

46:14.599 --> 46:15.809
I know.

46:17.853 --> 46:20.897
What could possibly be so important
and still you'll not say it?

46:22.482 --> 46:23.692
-I'll do it.
-No.

46:24.776 --> 46:25.861
Haniwa.

46:26.445 --> 46:28.530
She already knows everything
you're asking.

46:29.281 --> 46:30.490
I'll find it for you.

46:31.491 --> 46:34.077
If it were river bandits,
they're half a day away.

46:34.161 --> 46:35.787
If it was the Opayol,
there could be hundreds of them.

46:35.871 --> 46:37.622
A hundred of them won't see me coming.

46:37.706 --> 46:40.459
Do you know how fortunate we were
to escape the Witchfinder?

46:41.084 --> 46:42.669
Very fortunate.

46:42.753 --> 46:44.671
Another fight and now without arms?

46:44.755 --> 46:47.174
I'm not suggesting
we get into a fight, Papa.

46:48.050 --> 46:49.176
Whoever took it...

46:49.843 --> 46:52.054
how can they fight me
if they don't even know that I'm there?

46:52.137 --> 46:55.682
And besides, we don't know who they are.
We should at least try to figure out--

46:55.766 --> 46:57.225
I think I know.

46:59.311 --> 47:02.481
-What?
-I think I know who took our things.

47:04.191 --> 47:06.568
-What are you talking about?
-Look, please.

47:09.279 --> 47:12.115
What is it? What do you see?

47:26.671 --> 47:28.632
Tell me. What is it?

47:32.302 --> 47:33.345
Tell me.

47:47.275 --> 47:48.819
It is time, my queen.

47:49.444 --> 47:51.571
News of Lady An's parlor has spread.

47:51.655 --> 47:54.658
Demonstrations in protest of you
having killed several beloved lords

47:54.741 --> 47:56.451
have begun about the lower wall.

47:57.244 --> 48:00.372
The palace guard keeps them at bay,
but for how long I do not know.

48:07.587 --> 48:08.880
My queen?

48:11.717 --> 48:13.093
What happens next?

48:15.053 --> 48:17.180
The remaining lords are convening.

48:17.264 --> 48:20.559
If they gain the trust of the mob,
there's no telling what they may do.

49:38.595 --> 49:43.392
Father, whose power we feel
but cannot touch...

49:47.020 --> 49:48.563
I accept my fate.

49:50.107 --> 49:52.401
I thank you that I could choose its hour.

51:51.436 --> 51:55.232
Jerlamarel,
you did not come for me, my love.

51:56.566 --> 51:58.276
So I am coming to you.
