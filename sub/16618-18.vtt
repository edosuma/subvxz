WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:08.674
(school bell ringing)

00:10.378 --> 00:11.377
(Barney belches)

00:11.379 --> 00:13.445
(tires screeching)

00:14.382 --> 00:15.614
D'oh!

00:15.616 --> 00:16.615
(tires screeching)

00:16.617 --> 00:18.117
(grunts)

00:20.221 --> 00:21.720
(trumpets)

00:28.295 --> 00:30.295
(croaking)

00:34.001 --> 00:36.802
George, I'm sorry
to see you up here.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.838
Well, yes, but I died
for a worthy cause.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.975
As we speak, my body is
about to be dissected

00:42.977 --> 00:45.677
by a budding
young scientist.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.846
Let's observe
the dedication to learning

00:47.848 --> 00:51.417
of this ten-year-old scholar
by the name of Bart Simpson.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.486
♪ Stab, stab, stab, stab,
stab, die ♪

00:54.488 --> 00:56.655
♪ Stab, stab, die, die,
death, kill. ♪

00:56.657 --> 01:00.826
Well, his passion
is undeniable.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.828
Yes, very...
very impressive.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.498
By examining my specimen's
pyloric sphincter valve,

01:06.500 --> 01:10.369
I deduced that she had an
affinity for fruit flies.

01:10.371 --> 01:13.505
By examining my specimen's
natty dreads,

01:13.507 --> 01:18.444
I was able to deduce that he was
a jammin' Rasta-frogian.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.679
My body, my little
green body.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.515
Okay, but surely
his portrayal

01:23.517 --> 01:27.553
of Rastafarianism
will be culturally sensitive.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.021
Pass the Dutchie.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.690
We be smokin' slabba slabba
with the Babylon.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.193
Ribbit, ribbit, mon.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.695
(panting loudly)

01:36.697 --> 01:38.063
Come now, George.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.232
At least this Scottish
groundskeeper

01:40.234 --> 01:42.534
will give your remains
a respectful burial.

01:42.536 --> 01:46.405
WILLIE: Into the crapper you
go, useless froggy garbage.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.873
(toilet flushing)

01:47.875 --> 01:50.642
Are you going to put a
good spin on that, too?

01:50.644 --> 01:52.044
Hmm? Are you?!

01:52.046 --> 01:53.212
Well, are you?

01:53.214 --> 01:55.781
Well, uh... ribbit?

01:57.885 --> 02:00.552
MARGE: I can't put these grades
on the refrigerator.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.988
I can't even put them
on the garage refrigerator.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.823
It's not my fault.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.592
I blame "so-key-ity."
What?!

02:06.594 --> 02:08.560
You know, so-key-ity.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.829
That's what everyone
blames for everything.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.564
You mean "society"?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.900
Yeah, that's the guy.
Honey,

02:14.902 --> 02:16.902
I know you're a bright boy,

02:16.904 --> 02:18.904
but if you don't try harder
in school,

02:18.906 --> 02:20.973
you could end up...

02:27.681 --> 02:29.848
...not a success.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.783
Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mom.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.086
As long as I can
stand on a corner

02:34.088 --> 02:35.754
and spin a sign
reading "new condos,"

02:35.756 --> 02:37.823
I'll be just fine.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.027
(groaning)

02:42.029 --> 02:44.163
(Marge groaning)

02:46.600 --> 02:47.933
(Marge groaning)

02:47.935 --> 02:50.602
All that pacing
isn't gonna fix the boy.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.870
Just get him some pills.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.273
Two pinks and a blue,
and it's off to the races.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.542
Everything we've tried
with Bart has failed.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.477
What if there's nothing
we can do?

02:58.479 --> 03:00.879
Mm, "nothing we can do"
is a whole lot better

03:00.881 --> 03:02.447
than "it'll take all we've got."

03:02.449 --> 03:06.385
I wonder if anyone talks
about parenting online.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.656
Look at this one!

03:10.658 --> 03:12.457
HOMER:
They're skiing.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.959
Skiing means happy.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.828
Hmm, an expert with
a new book to promote.

03:16.830 --> 03:20.532
Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing
to speak to a group for a fee.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.070
Getting your child established

03:25.072 --> 03:27.639
on the path
to success isn't easy.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.509
I was driving my daughter
from her falconry tournament

03:30.511 --> 03:32.978
to lute class
when she turned to me asked...

03:32.980 --> 03:34.580
(speaks Mandarin)

03:34.582 --> 03:37.482
...which is Mandarin for,
"How do you do it?"

03:37.484 --> 03:39.418
She and I are learning Mandarin.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.320
The answer?
(speaks Mandarin)

03:41.322 --> 03:43.355
Positive reinforcement.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.424
(inquisitive chatter)

03:45.426 --> 03:47.926
In a recent study,
this mouse was denied food

03:47.928 --> 03:50.829
whenever he failed
to find his way through a maze.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.765
The mouse ended up dying...
of low self-esteem.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.168
(shocked and excited chatter)

03:56.170 --> 03:58.604
I had a nightmare
where that happened to Bart,

03:58.606 --> 04:00.606
but I never told you about it.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.041
I love it when you
don't tell me things.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.676
This mouse was given food

04:04.678 --> 04:06.945
whether he got
through the maze or not.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.515
And this fall,
he'll be in a lab at Harvard.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.784
(excited gasps and chatter)

04:12.786 --> 04:16.955
Low self-esteem can cripple
your child's chances of success.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.690
The cure: praise.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.125
(excited chatter)

04:20.127 --> 04:22.694
Praise they can hold
in their hands.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.964
Certificates, ribbons
and, yes, even trophies.

04:25.966 --> 04:26.965
(crowd gasps)

04:26.967 --> 04:28.700
(gasps) Trophies.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.869
So that's the easy answer.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.638
If Ralphie's shelf
says he's a winner,

04:32.640 --> 04:34.539
then he'll be one!

04:34.541 --> 04:37.776
And Moe yells a third thing
to feel part of the group!

04:39.380 --> 04:42.381
Yes! Trophies--
that's what Bart needs.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.383
This is how we save him.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.718
(scoffs) Give Bart
a trophy? What for?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.887
Most boogers wiped
on a bedroom wall?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.889
They're giving trophies
for that now?

04:50.891 --> 04:52.758
I weep for this country.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.826
Bart's future is at stake.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.895
Besides, I'm tired
of Springfield missing out

04:56.897 --> 05:00.766
on every parenting trend, like
the time-out and the diaper.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.568
I never got a trophy
when I was a kid,

05:03.570 --> 05:05.237
and I turned out just...

05:05.239 --> 05:07.306
(gulping)

05:09.243 --> 05:14.179
(slowly):
...fine.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.616
He's my son, and he's getting
a trophy for nothing.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.252
You hear me?
For nothing!

05:21.689 --> 05:23.622
Huh. Huh?

05:23.624 --> 05:24.790
(screams)

05:24.792 --> 05:26.091
Good morning.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.427
How's my special
little winner?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.196
How'd you get that thing in
my bed without waking me up?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.765
Because you're
a champion sleeper.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.867
It's the craziest thing.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.036
She will not give up
on that kid.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.872
Trophies<i> can </i>
boost self-esteem.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.108
If you actually win them,
like I did.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.443
But what's the point

05:44.445 --> 05:46.645
of just handing out
unearned statues?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.280
And statuettes.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.649
Well, it's just a waste
of gullible parents' money.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.618
(echoing):<i> Waste of gullible</i>
<i> parents' money.</i>

05:53.620 --> 05:55.620
<i> Gullible parents' money.</i>

05:55.622 --> 05:57.656
<i> Money. Money.</i>

05:57.658 --> 05:59.558
(bell dings)
Hmm.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.660
Step right up!
Every kid's a winner!

06:01.662 --> 06:04.296
The more you spend,
the more you love!

06:04.298 --> 06:05.697
Mm-hmm.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.335
I thought you agreed
that trophies should be earned.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.138
I'm earning nature's
trophy: money.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.139
(wind whistles softly)

06:14.141 --> 06:15.407
Remember, folks.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.909
Nothing but a genuine
Trophyland trophy says

06:17.911 --> 06:19.845
to your kids that...

06:19.847 --> 06:21.980
HOMER:
♪ You're the best around ♪

06:21.982 --> 06:24.483
♪ Nothing's gonna ever
keep you down ♪

06:24.485 --> 06:26.852
♪ You're the best around ♪

06:26.854 --> 06:29.521
♪ Nothing's gonna ever
keep you down ♪

06:29.523 --> 06:31.323
♪ You're the best around ♪

06:31.325 --> 06:33.658
♪ Nothing's gonna ever

06:33.660 --> 06:35.527
♪ You're the best around ♪

06:35.529 --> 06:36.995
♪ Nothing's gonna ♪

06:36.997 --> 06:38.663

06:43.837 --> 06:46.004
♪ You're the best. ♪

06:46.006 --> 06:49.441
(chuckles) These stupid, loving
parents will buy trophies

06:49.443 --> 06:51.510
for any accomplishment.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.112
Not wetting the bed,
using your inside voice,

06:54.114 --> 06:56.848
even "go watch TV
in the other room."

06:56.850 --> 06:59.851
I still think these things
are good for their self-esteem.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.787
Not to mention
the self-esteem

07:01.789 --> 07:04.022
that comes from
wad riffling.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.023
(wind whistles softly)

07:05.025 --> 07:07.359
Look, I even put
the boy to work.

07:07.361 --> 07:10.362
Well, then he should get
a trophy for that.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:11.799 --> 07:14.199
We have a saying in the
participation trophy business.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.901
"Don't get high--
self-esteem--

07:15.903 --> 07:18.537
on your own supply--
of self-esteem."

07:18.539 --> 07:20.806
I don't care.
I'm giving him this.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.808
What? Why did
it break?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.409
The parts are of
the highest quality.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.279
They come from the
China of China: India.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.417
Boy, did you glue this trophy
together with bubblegum?

07:32.419 --> 07:34.986
Eh, sticky is sticky.
I'm taking my break.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.829
HOMER: See? Giving him
trophies did nothing.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.564
You've showered him
with praise,

07:45.566 --> 07:47.432
and he's just
as lazy as ever.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.668
Shh! What if he
heard you say that?

07:49.670 --> 07:52.103
Hey, if Bart is
as bad at eavesdropping

07:52.105 --> 07:53.772
as he is at everything else,

07:53.774 --> 07:55.907
we've got nothing
to worry about.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.009
I say we keep
talking loudly.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.078
But what about
his confidence?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.681
Face it.
Our son is a screw-up.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.784
He was born a screw-up, and
no matter how hard he tries--

08:05.786 --> 08:07.252
which he never will--

08:07.254 --> 08:09.788
Bart will<i> always </i>
be a screw-up.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.022
(groans)

08:11.024 --> 08:13.758
And have you ever heard that
sound he makes when he's sad?

08:13.760 --> 08:15.093
Pathetic.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.867
(sighs)

08:23.103 --> 08:26.771
Queen's bishop Lomotil
takes king's Ativan.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.874
Oh, looks like I'll be
having a panic attack

08:28.876 --> 08:30.375
on the toilet tonight.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.944
(scoffs) Look at that
whimpering little crybaby.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.813
(mocking):
Wah! Wah!

08:34.815 --> 08:37.282
Abe, that's
your grandson.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.817
Come visit me!

08:38.819 --> 08:40.385
I'm so lonely!

08:40.387 --> 08:43.788
(crying):
Wah! Wah!

08:43.790 --> 08:45.790
What's got you down, kiddo?

08:45.792 --> 08:48.293
My dad says I'm terrible
at everything.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.296
Oh, he's just repeating
what he heard as a boy from me.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.833
Oh, I was an awful father,
just like my old man.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.501
Your dad didn't
believe in you, either?

08:56.503 --> 08:57.836
It wasn't his fault.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.505
He was just focused
on his career

09:00.507 --> 09:02.974
as a professional child-beater.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.910
<i> Men would come</i>
<i> from five towns over</i>

09:04.912 --> 09:06.811
<i> to study my father's </i>
<i> technique.</i>

09:06.813 --> 09:09.748
<i> But no matter</i>
<i>how many strangles he patented,</i>

09:09.750 --> 09:12.017
<i> his father never approved.</i>

09:12.019 --> 09:13.351
(choking loudly)

09:13.353 --> 09:16.354
Even if only a little bit
of that really happened,

09:16.356 --> 09:18.657
I'll never escape
being a loser.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.158
That's loser talk!

09:20.160 --> 09:23.061
You're a great kid,
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.164
Boy, this here's
a real trophy.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.767
Our family's
most prized possession:

09:28.769 --> 09:31.169
a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.771
It's been a Simpson heirloom

09:32.773 --> 09:35.774
ever since it was stolen
off a dead body at Gettysburg.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.709
In 1982.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.377
Whoa!

09:39.379 --> 09:41.880
Wait. Is this just another
gold shiny thing

09:41.882 --> 09:44.115
to trick me into
feeling special when I'm not?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.517
You are special!

09:45.519 --> 09:47.185
You're like my prostate--

09:47.187 --> 09:50.689
a spiky little troublemaker
who plays by his own rules.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.557
You don't take hooey
from Louis.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.593
Never have, never will.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.866
It's like a sunburn
on the inside.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.234
It's called "pride."

10:03.236 --> 10:04.703
Every tick will remind you

10:04.705 --> 10:06.905
you've got a grandpa
who believes in you.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.707
The same way I believe

10:08.709 --> 10:11.710
the retirement home
has been taken over by robots.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.712

10:54.621 --> 10:56.087
Ugh, parents.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.756
Those lazy
lunch-packers.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.291
They just want to
be told what to do.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.608
Clearly, this is
a community in the grip

11:16.610 --> 11:17.942
of an addiction to trophies.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.110
Now, parents,

11:19.112 --> 11:22.447
I warn you, too much praise
creates millennials--

11:22.449 --> 11:25.617
a generation of soft,
entitled narcissists,

11:25.619 --> 11:29.054
who drop out of college
to become deejays.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.624
That only pays well
at the very highest levels.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.126
Instead of showering
your kids with gifts,

11:35.128 --> 11:38.296
you should prod them

11:41.835 --> 11:43.501
Tired.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.570
He's got a word made
of other words.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.739
(chuckles) He must know
what he's talking about.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.474
Oh, it is an end to praise.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.742
Praise Vishnu.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.744

11:52.746 --> 11:54.846

also stands for:

Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.319
Another word word!

Why does the word "of"
sometimes count in the acronym

12:05.158 --> 12:06.991
and sometimes not?

12:06.993 --> 12:11.162
Shut up, Mel! Your kids live
in Nebraska with your mom.

How's the trophy business?

12:26.513 --> 12:29.347
Nobody wants them
anymore, thanks to GRIT.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.851
Stupid parenting method
I can't exploit for money.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.619
Actually kinda
makes sense.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.187
Hate it so much.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.722
(Homer gasps)

12:37.724 --> 12:39.190
I know that.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.859
That's my dad's
old pocket watch.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.527
How did you get it?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.796
Oh, Grampa said I earned it.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.698
I guess someone
in this family's proud of me.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.867
Oh, you didn't want it, did you?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.635
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.537
That watch means
nothing to me.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.473
Really? Then how do you
explain that case you made?

12:55.475 --> 12:58.743
I built it to always remind me
of what not to want.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.879
What about your
self-published novel?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.914
Well, the character
of John Homer

13:02.916 --> 13:05.083
is only partly
based on me.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.886
Well, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you were obsessed

13:07.888 --> 13:10.054
with getting Grampa's watch.

13:10.056 --> 13:13.825
Ooh, thanks for the analysis,
Dr. Freud.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.594
Next you'll be telling me
that this whole trophy business,

13:16.596 --> 13:18.730
and in fact, all my
get-rich-quick schemes

13:18.732 --> 13:22.233
over the years, are born of
a desperate need for approval

13:22.235 --> 13:24.936
from a father
who couldn't show love.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.338
Likely because of
his traumatic relationship

13:27.340 --> 13:30.775
with his own father,
and his before him, and so on.

13:30.777 --> 13:34.245
But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud,

13:34.247 --> 13:38.750
that couldn't be further
from the truth, Doctor.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.018
If you say so.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.587
Now I'm gonna take this out
and see what life is like

13:42.589 --> 13:45.824
with real love and encouragement
ticking in my pocket.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.526

13:48.528 --> 13:49.794
Doesn't even have a fob.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.630
I went to most
of the practices.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.033

when another parenting expert

15:35.035 --> 15:38.202

new theory on self-esteem?

15:38.204 --> 15:39.704
Another expert?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.439

What are they saying?

15:45.545 --> 15:46.778
Aw.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.719
Okay, the watch is gone.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.555

They want us for the cover.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.771
You, me and the pocket watch.

16:13.773 --> 16:14.906
Um...

16:14.908 --> 16:17.075
It's a great story.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.243
Passing a beloved heirloom
from grandfather to grandson.

16:19.245 --> 16:22.680
A gift that restored
a child's faith in himself.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.583
Uh, Grampa, there's something
I have to tell you.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.751
Hold on one second.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.252
I'm just finishing up

16:28.254 --> 16:30.588

16:32.425 --> 16:35.360
any major disappointments,
I'll be fine.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.428
Now, what did you want
to tell me?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.697
Uh, helmets ruined football.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.766
Exactly! If you want
to protect your head,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.101
grow your hair long.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.870
Anyway, I'll see you
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

16:45.872 --> 16:49.273
And you won't be late
because you've got that watch.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.808
(groans)

16:50.810 --> 16:52.777
Stupid parenting experts.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.780
Why don't they write a book
called<i> Stop Buying These Books?</i>

16:55.782 --> 16:57.448
Everybody'd buy that.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.550
Even if I was listening
to what you said,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.619
it doesn't matter;
nothing matters.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.454
My trophy business
has failed

17:03.456 --> 17:05.490
and Bart has the
thing I wanted most:

17:05.492 --> 17:07.058
Grampa's watch.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.059
What watch?

17:08.061 --> 17:10.561
The one you get
for being a success.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.963
Well, then I should have it.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.132
Uh, that never really came up.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.535
All that's left to do now
is bring these to the needy.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.806
Best I can do
is charge you ten dollars

17:21.808 --> 17:23.307
to throw them
in my Dumpster.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.077
How about I give you a trophy
that says "Best Pawn Shop"?

17:26.079 --> 17:27.812
Not unless I earned it.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.713
(gasps)

17:30.316 --> 17:31.649
Dad's watch!

17:31.651 --> 17:32.817
Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.519
How did this come to you?

17:34.521 --> 17:35.920
Mm. Some kid
brought it in.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.655
Said he was mad
at his friend

17:37.657 --> 17:41.659
for dropping so many rocks
in his eye.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.728
That dude's seen
a lot of living.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.165
Yours for 20 bucks.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.699
That's an insult.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.935
You're talking about a
self-worth-boosting antique

17:50.937 --> 17:53.538
that's been in my family
for generations.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.772
Twenty-two?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.908
You'll take it all
and you'll like it.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.681
(maniacal laugh)

18:03.683 --> 18:05.516
Yes. I have it.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.018
Some said it would never happen.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.020
Most were unaware
of the situation.

18:09.022 --> 18:12.123
But I finally have
my father's watch!

18:12.125 --> 18:14.192
(maniacal laugh)

18:16.696 --> 18:20.131
(singsongy): Oh, Bart,
look what Daddy's got now.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.600
(Bart crying)

18:23.703 --> 18:27.538
Grampa was the only person
who believed in me.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.974
But when he finds out
I lost the watch,

18:29.976 --> 18:31.375
even he'll give up.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.543
(sobbing)

18:32.545 --> 18:33.711
Stay strong, Homer.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.379
Don't go soft on him now.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.915
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
face-rubbing-in.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.650
Mm. Come on, foot.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.885
Kick, damn you!

18:40.887 --> 18:41.953
(grunts)

18:43.490 --> 18:47.725
(sighs) Son, I found something
that belongs to you.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.894
(gasps) Grampa's watch!

18:49.896 --> 18:51.896
No. I can't take it.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.731
I didn't earn it,
so I don't deserve it.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.233
You were right.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.901
I am a screwup.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.438
But, boy,
who screwed you up?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.406
(gasps) You.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.008
It was you.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.677

19:08.615 --> 19:10.281

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
It's stuck in
your hand fat.

19:15.922 --> 19:20.191
Oh. You got to wedge something
in there to break the vacuum.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.826

watch watcher.
