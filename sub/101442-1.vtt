01:04.666 --> 01:06.750
or Coal Creek, West Virginia were,

01:06.833 --> 01:09.458
they probably couldn't point 'em out
to you on a map.

01:11.458 --> 01:14.125
But I guarantee,
they'd be there all the same.

01:17.083 --> 01:21.625
How and why so many people
from those two piddlin' places on that map

01:21.708 --> 01:25.000

has a lot to do with our story.

01:26.625 --> 01:28.833
Some would claim it was just dumb luck,

01:28.916 --> 01:31.416
while others might swear
it was God's intention.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.416
But I'd say
with the way things turned out,

01:35.500 --> 01:36.916
it was a little bit of both.

01:39.291 --> 01:43.458
In 1957, it'd take someone
approximately ten hours

01:43.541 --> 01:46.125
to drive from Coal Creek
to a paper mill town

01:46.208 --> 01:48.208

02:47.291 --> 02:50.000
in a small clearing behind his house.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.041
He came every morning and evening
to talk to God.

It seemed to his son that his father
fought the Devil all the time.

No bullshittin', he'll know.

03:09.791 --> 03:11.125

to the war in the South Pacific

03:15.125 --> 03:18.750

43:00.833 --> 43:03.125
and I'm gonna take some pictures,
that's all.

43:04.791 --> 43:05.708
Your wife?

43:06.916 --> 43:07.791
Come on.

43:09.208 --> 43:11.125
I've never heard of such a thing.

43:12.041 --> 43:13.875
I thought you was a good Christian--

43:13.958 --> 43:16.666
Shut the fuck up
and get that welfare suit off, son.

43:18.083 --> 43:20.625
-Jesus.
-Well, I've been run through the wringer!

43:22.458 --> 43:24.625
Do you really want these hands
touching you?

43:24.708 --> 43:25.791
Oh, come on, sweetie.

43:25.875 --> 43:29.625
We'll just take a few pictures and then
the big dumb bastard will leave us alone.

43:29.708 --> 43:32.458

43:49.791 --> 43:51.166
[Carl] Oh, Jesus.

43:57.541 --> 43:59.916
Carl, maybe we should just
get out of here.

44:01.375 --> 44:02.416
Oh, forget it. Jesus.

-[Sandy] I'm cold, Carl.
-I know it's cold

[narrator] Roy looked up
at the clouds drifting by and wondered

44:06.916 --> 44:10.583
if that's what death would be like,
just floating away in the air.

44:13.083 --> 44:16.541
He preached on it for years,
but still didn't know what to expect.

44:18.125 --> 44:19.541
Just one thing.

44:20.041 --> 44:21.125
Yeah, what's that?

44:22.250 --> 44:23.833
Her name is Lenora.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.125
What the fuck you talking about?

This was still early days for the pair,

44:44.125 --> 44:46.541
and Carl was still working out
the particulars.

44:46.625 --> 44:47.583
[Carl] God damn...

44:47.666 --> 44:51.375
He realized that he would have
to get more selective with his models

44:51.458 --> 44:53.208
if he wanted to keep Sandy onboard.

44:53.291 --> 44:56.208
[Carl] Get some shots off down there
while the light's still good.

45:07.166 --> 45:08.833

48:36.750 --> 48:40.250
[narrator] Boys in school liked
to pick on Lenora for her pious manner

by the dumpster behind school.

-He would do anything to protect her.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.958
No matter what the weather was,

49:21.041 --> 49:23.750
Lenora would visit her mother's grave
after school.

49:24.708 --> 49:27.208
Some days
she'd even read the Bible out loud,

49:27.291 --> 49:29.166
and imagine her mother was listening.

49:30.250 --> 49:32.083
Though he wasn't one for praying

49:32.666 --> 49:35.166
Arvin would often drive her
and keep her company.

49:36.333 --> 49:37.500
[Lenora] Arvin?

49:44.875 --> 49:47.500
It was a sight
you didn't end up in the hospital.

49:48.291 --> 49:52.000
Yeah, well, there's a lot of no good
sons of bitches out there. [grunts]

49:52.583 --> 49:56.250
Well, Lord, Arvin, you've been saying that
almost since the day I met you.

49:56.875 --> 49:58.625
You know, that's because it's true.

50:00.708 --> 50:03.875
Maybe you should try praying for 'em then.
Would that hurt none?

50:05.500 --> 50:09.333
You already do enough for all of us,
and where's it doing you much good, huh?

50:10.500 --> 50:12.125
You know what would do you good?

50:12.791 --> 50:16.416
To not be wandering behind school
by your own self, like I told you.

50:18.083 --> 50:19.625
Fuckin' Gene Dinwoodie.

50:23.750 --> 50:25.208
Do you ever think about...

50:26.000 --> 50:28.458
how we ended up orphans
living in the same house?

50:30.625 --> 50:31.583
No.

50:32.583 --> 50:34.666
Besides, you might not even be an orphan.

50:35.625 --> 50:37.458
As far as everybody
around here is concerned

50:37.541 --> 50:40.333
your daddy's probably still out there
somewhere alive and kicking.

50:42.500 --> 50:46.000
Fuck, he might even come over that hill
any day now, dancing a jig.

50:47.916 --> 50:49.083
[chuckles] I hope so.

50:50.666 --> 50:52.583
I pray every day he will.

50:53.916 --> 50:55.625
Even if it means he did something?

50:56.250 --> 50:58.083
I've already forgiven him.

50:58.583 --> 50:59.500
Hm.

51:00.833 --> 51:02.041
We could start over.

51:03.750 --> 51:05.250
That's crazy.

51:05.333 --> 51:06.458
No, it's not.

51:11.125 --> 51:12.291
What about your father?

51:16.083 --> 51:17.208
What about him?

Well...

51:29.708 --> 51:30.875
if he could come back.

51:30.958 --> 51:33.791
Well, shut your mouth. We both know
that ain't never gonna happen.

51:35.250 --> 51:36.875

You know,
I appreciate you always coming with me.

be doing something else.

thinking they're...

1:22:29.166 --> 1:22:30.291
the president

1:22:30.916 --> 1:22:31.958
or...

1:22:32.833 --> 1:22:35.666
or a Hollywood celebrity

1:22:35.750 --> 1:22:38.041
like Ava Gardner.

1:22:42.083 --> 1:22:43.583
I--

1:22:49.291 --> 1:22:52.166
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:56.333
The thing is, that's the part of it.

1:22:57.250 --> 1:22:58.458
The book says...

1:22:59.708 --> 1:23:00.750
it's not,

1:23:01.375 --> 1:23:02.958
not understanding.

1:23:04.166 --> 1:23:05.583
See, think about it.

1:23:06.708 --> 1:23:07.791
How...

1:23:09.083 --> 1:23:10.250
could I be

1:23:10.750 --> 1:23:11.750
the daddy...

1:23:12.666 --> 1:23:15.666
when all we done
is spend time with the Lord?

1:23:15.750 --> 1:23:16.750
[door closes]

1:23:20.708 --> 1:23:21.875
[Arvin] Late night?

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:27.958
[Earskell] Played cards
over at Elder Stubbs's garage again.

1:23:28.708 --> 1:23:30.000
You win this time?

1:23:32.375 --> 1:23:33.916
No, not really.

1:23:34.500 --> 1:23:35.375
[chuckles]

1:23:37.708 --> 1:23:40.000
Saw Fred Dinwoodie over there.

1:23:40.083 --> 1:23:42.458
He said his boy is just about healed up.

1:23:44.333 --> 1:23:46.916
I still think
you could have held back a little bit.

1:23:48.458 --> 1:23:50.541
Well, he ain't bothered Lenora since.

1:23:51.916 --> 1:23:53.750
Him or his candy-ass buddies.

1:23:54.416 --> 1:23:57.416
I gotta go check in on her.
She ain't been feeling too good.

1:23:58.166 --> 1:24:00.833
You keep an eye on her for me
while we're at church.

1:24:00.916 --> 1:24:01.916
[Lenora retches]

1:24:03.791 --> 1:24:04.625
[coughs]

1:24:05.125 --> 1:24:08.750
[narrator] Lenora had stopped asking Arvin
to join her at Helen's grave.

1:24:09.333 --> 1:24:10.791
He didn't mind much.

1:24:11.291 --> 1:24:13.416
His mind
would always drift back to Willard

1:24:13.500 --> 1:24:16.166
and the prayer log and his poor dog Jack.

1:24:17.625 --> 1:24:20.666
Besides, he'd gotten a job
working on the road crew

1:24:20.833 --> 1:24:22.625
and was busy making some money.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.208
[inhales] I never missed church before.

1:24:29.541 --> 1:24:30.791
[panting]

1:24:32.625 --> 1:24:34.416
[breathing heavily]

1:24:35.250 --> 1:24:36.833
I'm so ashamed.

1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:41.541
You ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.

1:24:41.625 --> 1:24:44.625
I'm sure the Lord will forgive you
for missing one Sunday.

1:24:45.791 --> 1:24:48.625
Ol' Jesus probably had
his fair share of bad mornings.

1:24:50.083 --> 1:24:51.208
[chuckles]

1:24:54.333 --> 1:24:55.791
[whispers] I love you, Arvin.

1:25:04.791 --> 1:25:06.041
[Lenora sighs]

1:25:06.125 --> 1:25:07.750
How's about we, uh... [sniffles]

1:25:08.333 --> 1:25:10.500
go see your mama's grave
when you're better?

1:25:13.291 --> 1:25:14.375
Sound all right?

1:25:17.041 --> 1:25:18.666
[Preston] The good book...

1:25:18.750 --> 1:25:21.458
is filled with good men

1:25:22.125 --> 1:25:23.375
and women

1:25:23.458 --> 1:25:25.458
suffering delusions.

1:25:27.083 --> 1:25:28.666
Eve in the garden.

1:25:29.916 --> 1:25:30.916
Noah...

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:33.208
naked, drunk.

1:25:33.875 --> 1:25:35.958
Bringing shame upon his family.

1:25:37.416 --> 1:25:40.041
The idol
the Jews bowed before in the desert.

1:25:43.458 --> 1:25:47.125
And even the Lord Jesus himself
was presented with delusions in the desert

1:25:47.208 --> 1:25:49.500
that only through his faith...

1:25:50.125 --> 1:25:51.500
and his strength...

1:25:52.125 --> 1:25:53.791
-overcame.
-[man 1] Mm-hmm.

1:25:54.291 --> 1:25:55.500
[man 2] Praise Jesus.

1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:01.041
The Lord's delusion in the desert
was a game...

1:26:02.708 --> 1:26:05.458
of the so-called "Devil."

1:26:08.166 --> 1:26:10.458
And what the Lord experienced...

1:26:11.541 --> 1:26:15.041
was a delusion
that would've kept him from saving us!

1:26:15.541 --> 1:26:17.875
But he did not fall for it!

1:26:20.333 --> 1:26:22.583
It is our delusions

1:26:22.666 --> 1:26:24.541
that lead us to sin.

1:26:27.083 --> 1:26:30.958
Striking a mother or a wife
for something that you thought they said.

1:26:32.750 --> 1:26:35.833
Neglecting work or Sunday service,
for that matter.

1:26:35.916 --> 1:26:37.541
[man] Right. You said it.

1:26:38.375 --> 1:26:39.583
Some girl...

1:26:40.250 --> 1:26:43.583
gets a feeling for a fella
and lets him have her holy gift.

1:26:47.875 --> 1:26:49.750
Delusions!

1:26:51.041 --> 1:26:55.166
Blaspheming the Lord
in your mind and in your heart

1:26:55.250 --> 1:26:58.500
for some wrong done to you
by another person.

1:26:58.583 --> 1:26:59.666
[man] That's true.

1:27:02.583 --> 1:27:03.958
You're saying you don't...

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.833
remember all the things
we did in your car?

1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:13.166
I'm saying you must be crazy.

1:27:13.250 --> 1:27:16.750
Coming in the Lord's house
and talking all this trash.

1:27:19.458 --> 1:27:21.458
Look, my advice to you, girl...

1:27:23.458 --> 1:27:25.208
is you figure some way to get rid of it.

1:27:26.666 --> 1:27:28.041
'Cause otherwise...

1:27:29.041 --> 1:27:32.500
it's gonna be you, a whore mother,

1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.500
and her little bastard child
running around,

1:27:36.583 --> 1:27:39.833
living in that poor old woman's house
who raised you.

1:27:41.625 --> 1:27:44.125
If nothing else, think of her.

1:27:44.791 --> 1:27:47.041
She'll die from the shame of it all.

1:27:59.625 --> 1:28:00.708
Come on.

1:28:17.333 --> 1:28:18.208
Come on.

1:28:33.375 --> 1:28:36.458
[narrator] Lenora suddenly knew
she was making a mistake.

1:28:37.916 --> 1:28:39.791
Grandma wouldn't be ashamed

1:28:40.375 --> 1:28:42.791
and she and her baby would be okay.

1:28:45.833 --> 1:28:47.125
[choking]

1:29:00.708 --> 1:29:02.583
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1:29:02.708 --> 1:29:05.000
No! No! No!

1:29:05.083 --> 1:29:06.250
[yells] Grandma!

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.166
Grandma!

1:29:08.333 --> 1:29:10.208
No, no, no!

1:29:13.250 --> 1:29:14.458
Grandma!

1:29:15.375 --> 1:29:16.375
[grunts]

1:29:17.208 --> 1:29:19.083
[somber violin music playing]

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:20.958
Grandma! [grunts]

1:29:23.375 --> 1:29:26.166
[narrator] No one would know
she wasn't a suicide

1:29:26.541 --> 1:29:29.875
and that in the end,
she was all right with her maker.

1:29:30.333 --> 1:29:31.416
Oh, Lord.

1:29:33.958 --> 1:29:36.458
There's just some things
we can't understand.

1:29:40.291 --> 1:29:42.333
But you take her into your arms.

1:29:42.916 --> 1:29:44.291
[Emma sobbing]

1:29:50.083 --> 1:29:51.375
Uh, ain't somebody...

1:29:52.875 --> 1:29:54.250
saying prayers or...

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:56.000
[clears throat]

1:29:57.375 --> 1:29:59.583
[somber music continues playing]

1:30:01.166 --> 1:30:02.708
[Emma sobs]

1:30:08.083 --> 1:30:09.500
[breathes heavily]

1:30:12.833 --> 1:30:13.750
[sniffles]

1:30:23.916 --> 1:30:25.666
[indistinct chatter]

1:30:32.041 --> 1:30:33.833
[man 1]
Need to have a word with you, Arvin.

1:30:33.916 --> 1:30:35.750
-[man 2] All right, see ya, buddy.
-[man 3] Yep.

1:30:35.833 --> 1:30:36.833
See ya tomorrow.

1:30:37.333 --> 1:30:38.458
[Arvin] About what?

1:30:40.875 --> 1:30:41.958
[man 1] It's, uh...

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.208
It's about Lenora.

1:30:50.791 --> 1:30:51.791
What about her?

1:30:54.625 --> 1:30:57.250
I came by here instead of home
so nothing's...

1:30:57.958 --> 1:30:59.250
put on your grandmother.

1:31:00.958 --> 1:31:02.333
"Put on"? What do you mean?

1:31:03.875 --> 1:31:04.791
Well...

1:31:07.416 --> 1:31:09.333
ol' Dudley, in the Coroner's...

1:31:10.333 --> 1:31:12.000
I ain't never heard of no Dudley.

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:15.541
Well, he's a drunk...
but he ain't no liar.

1:31:17.750 --> 1:31:20.291
Did you know Lenora was carrying a baby?

1:31:26.458 --> 1:31:27.625
That's bullshit.

1:31:28.541 --> 1:31:30.125
That son of a bitch is lying.

1:31:31.708 --> 1:31:32.708
I tell ya...

1:31:33.875 --> 1:31:35.166
Dudley ain't a liar.

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:39.708
He came to me privately
so as your family knew.

1:31:40.541 --> 1:31:41.791
I felt he was right.

1:31:47.458 --> 1:31:50.541
Now, I might've put my foot
in something. It...

1:31:51.166 --> 1:31:52.625
wasn't my intentions.

1:31:55.666 --> 1:31:58.250
You know that preacher
ain't said no words for her.

1:32:00.541 --> 1:32:02.458
Not for people that kill themselves.

1:32:29.833 --> 1:32:31.833
[engine starting]

1:32:38.875 --> 1:32:40.875
[engine revving]

1:32:47.208 --> 1:32:49.041
[moaning]

1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:01.916
[Preston grunts]

1:33:21.708 --> 1:33:23.500
[engine starting]

1:33:57.666 --> 1:33:58.625
[grunts]

1:33:59.250 --> 1:34:00.666
[inhales deeply]

1:34:11.083 --> 1:34:12.000
[sighs] Uncle...

1:34:12.083 --> 1:34:15.375
[narrator] Arvin wanted so much
to be able to tell them goodbye,

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.708
but they would be better off
not knowing anything

1:34:18.791 --> 1:34:20.833
if the law came looking for him.

1:34:20.916 --> 1:34:22.708
You have to be good to Grandma.

1:34:26.625 --> 1:34:29.750
You know that she ain't hardly been out
of her bed since the funeral?

1:34:30.666 --> 1:34:31.583
Yeah.

1:34:32.833 --> 1:34:34.041
Grandma needs you.

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:36.958
All right?

1:34:49.916 --> 1:34:51.916
[somber violin music playing]

1:35:35.208 --> 1:35:36.375
[Arvin] Dear Grandma...

1:35:37.166 --> 1:35:40.625
I'm writing to you
because I cannot say goodbye to your face.

1:35:41.333 --> 1:35:45.375
I love you and I will always remember
the things that you have done for me.

1:35:45.458 --> 1:35:46.416
[door creaks open]

1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:49.666
What I'm about to do,
I do because I have to,

1:35:49.750 --> 1:35:51.291
not because I want to.

1:35:51.958 --> 1:35:53.833
Please do not try and find me.

1:35:53.916 --> 1:35:56.375
Love, your grandson, Arvin.

1:36:01.208 --> 1:36:02.250
[lip smacking]

1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:05.166
[Arvin breathes shakily]

1:36:09.333 --> 1:36:11.166
[breathing shakily]

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.208
[exhales]

1:36:19.083 --> 1:36:20.125
[quietly] Excuse me.

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:24.041
[clears throat]

1:36:24.125 --> 1:36:25.125
Excuse me.

1:36:25.208 --> 1:36:26.250
Preacher?

1:36:30.250 --> 1:36:31.750
Got time for a sinner?

1:36:35.250 --> 1:36:38.125
I've been doing wrong
and I wanna get right by the Lord.

1:36:42.541 --> 1:36:44.208
Well, that's what I'm here for.

1:36:48.208 --> 1:36:49.125
I've done...

1:36:51.250 --> 1:36:52.708
lustful acts.

1:36:55.875 --> 1:36:56.833
Yeah.

1:36:58.041 --> 1:37:00.000
That could be a big problem.

1:37:00.666 --> 1:37:02.125
Especially for the young people.

1:37:03.791 --> 1:37:05.208
Go on, tell me about it.

1:37:07.041 --> 1:37:09.041
I got me a pretty wife at home.

1:37:10.375 --> 1:37:12.791
One that'll do pretty much anything I ask.

1:37:14.625 --> 1:37:16.083
But I treat her real bad.

1:37:17.833 --> 1:37:19.416
Well, when you say anything,

1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:21.208
what do you mean?

1:37:23.583 --> 1:37:24.791
Just what I said.

1:37:26.791 --> 1:37:30.208
Sometimes she'll be going down
on me with...

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:32.166
[breathing shakily]

1:37:32.875 --> 1:37:34.375
well, you know, her mouth.

1:37:36.250 --> 1:37:38.833
Heck, I get so excited I start forcing it.

1:37:43.208 --> 1:37:44.666
She ever puke on you?

1:37:46.541 --> 1:37:49.333
They got a little trigger,
back there in their throat.

1:37:51.125 --> 1:37:52.833
Yeah, well, that ain't my problem.

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.833
Well, what's the problem then, son?

1:38:00.541 --> 1:38:03.250
This guy I work with
has got himself a daughter.

1:38:04.791 --> 1:38:07.791
Real young thing,
just started high school.

1:38:11.208 --> 1:38:14.500
One day I got this girl in my truck
and I drove her out into the sticks

1:38:14.583 --> 1:38:15.625
and I...

1:38:17.416 --> 1:38:18.750
had my way with her.

1:38:22.708 --> 1:38:24.250
Did she put up a fight?

1:38:26.541 --> 1:38:27.541
No.

1:38:30.791 --> 1:38:32.541
But, you see, the problem is, is...

1:38:34.625 --> 1:38:37.416
once I'd had a taste,
I just couldn't get enough.

1:38:38.750 --> 1:38:41.208
I kept taking that girl there
any chance I got.

1:38:43.458 --> 1:38:44.708
So I'd strip her clothes off.

1:38:48.625 --> 1:38:50.833
But I'd make her pray
before we got started.

1:38:58.583 --> 1:39:00.833
Why don't you take that hat off, boy.

1:39:02.416 --> 1:39:03.500
Sometimes I'd even...

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:05.333
keep her panties.

1:39:07.791 --> 1:39:08.916
Now, I'd just...

Give me a couple minutes here
alone with her.

1:53:45.375 --> 1:53:47.958
[narrator] She'd always been
sort of fucked up,

1:53:48.041 --> 1:53:51.416
but Lee blamed Carl
for the way she'd gone downhill.

1:53:52.125 --> 1:53:55.958
Regardless of all that,
she was still his baby sister.

1:54:01.708 --> 1:54:05.208
But the sheriff couldn't help but think
of his own situation for a moment.

1:54:06.041 --> 1:54:08.166
He thought about that photo
he found of her

1:54:08.250 --> 1:54:10.458
and worried about what else
people might find

1:54:10.541 --> 1:54:12.125
if he didn't get to it first.

Though the poor fucker had been
completely worthless as a model,

Carl was insistent on keeping a record

1:55:58.958 --> 1:56:02.208
of both his successes and his failures.

-Yeah.
-Where you headed?

1:56:53.750 --> 1:56:56.750
There used to be a house and a barn
up on the hill over there.

1:56:56.833 --> 1:56:58.791
Some lawyer owned it. You know it?

1:56:58.875 --> 1:56:59.875
Sure I do.

1:57:00.666 --> 1:57:02.083
Up in the Mitchell Flats.

1:57:03.708 --> 1:57:04.666
Still there?

1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:08.291
Well, I'll be damned.

1:57:09.458 --> 1:57:11.041
You're that Russell boy, ain't you?

1:57:14.583 --> 1:57:18.250
I just thought, seeing as I was this way,
I'd stop by and see the old place again.

that I ain't never forgot it.

1:57:57.166 --> 1:58:00.250
You had that pie smeared
all across your face.

1:58:00.791 --> 1:58:04.208

Remember that?

1:58:04.875 --> 1:58:07.083

about that night.

1:58:08.666 --> 1:58:10.500
He ain't the lawman that I expected.

1:58:11.333 --> 1:58:12.833

1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:14.791

1:58:14.875 --> 1:58:17.291
Well, his sister and her husband
were found dead.

in Lewisburg, West Virginia.

1:58:36.250 --> 1:58:38.041

as soon as possible.

1:58:38.125 --> 1:58:41.000

I had a man shot down here two days back.

1:58:41.083 --> 1:58:42.583
He was a preacher.

1:58:42.666 --> 1:58:45.708
And we're suspecting it's a boy
that used to live up around your parts.

1:58:45.791 --> 1:58:46.833
That right?

1:58:47.333 --> 1:58:48.583
How'd he kill the man?

1:58:48.666 --> 1:58:50.416
A couple shots.

1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:53.916
Pistol. Probably a Luger
that the boy's known to have.

1:58:55.291 --> 1:58:57.625
-That's a nine millimeter, ain't it?
-That's right.

1:58:59.750 --> 1:59:01.333
What'd you say the boy's name was?

1:59:01.416 --> 1:59:04.000
I didn't say, but it's Arvin Russell.

1:59:04.083 --> 1:59:07.000
Both of his parents died up around there,
as I understand it.

1:59:07.083 --> 1:59:09.875
Father was a suicide,
and he's been living down here

1:59:09.958 --> 1:59:11.625
with the grandmother and the uncle.

1:59:12.125 --> 1:59:14.666
Listen, I don't think the boy's dangerous.

1:59:15.541 --> 1:59:19.000
From what I'm hearing,
this preacher might've deserved killing.

1:59:19.083 --> 1:59:19.916
Is this boy driving?

1:59:20.916 --> 1:59:21.791
Could be.

1:59:21.875 --> 1:59:25.500
He owns an ol' busted up Chevy 3100, '54.

1:59:25.583 --> 1:59:28.000
I don't know
that it'd make it all the way up there.

1:59:28.083 --> 1:59:30.291
At this point, he might be hitchhiking.

my daddy didn't do anything
like what your daddy did up there,

2:00:03.291 --> 2:00:05.958
but he did up and leave me,
my mama, and my sister.

2:00:07.958 --> 2:00:11.375
He just went off to the shoe factory
one morning and never came back.

2:00:12.166 --> 2:00:14.916
And there was nothing to do
but forget his sorry ass.

2:00:18.125 --> 2:00:21.041

leading up to his mother's death,

how Willard wanted so much
for her to live.

2:02:25.750 --> 2:02:28.000
His father
would have done anything to save her.

And suddenly he realized,
standing in his father's church,

2:02:42.583 --> 2:02:44.541
that he'd had no other choice,

2:02:45.458 --> 2:02:48.791
that Willard had needed to go
wherever Charlotte went.

Maybe he'd be forgiven.
