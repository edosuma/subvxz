00:33.299 --> 00:34.401
Hi.

00:34.401 --> 00:35.402
We gotta go.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.511
We gotta go, come on. Come on.

01:18.511 --> 01:19.712
Come on, come on, get up, get up.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.081
Just get up, just get -

01:21.081 --> 01:22.115
- [Woman] No!

01:25.919 --> 01:28.855

01:59.619 --> 02:02.388
(arrow thwacks)

02:03.923 --> 02:06.059
- [Man 1] A pandemic has been officially declared

02:06.059 --> 02:09.062
as the as yet unknown virus sweeps the nation.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.563
The Eradication Control Task Force...

02:10.563 --> 02:11.498
- [News Reporter 1] Cities have been left to formulate

02:11.498 --> 02:13.133
their own strategies to deal

02:13.133 --> 02:15.502
with uncontrolled rates of infection.

02:15.502 --> 02:16.970
Meanwhile...

02:16.970 --> 02:17.770
- [News Reporter 2] Miles as people flee Chicago

02:17.770 --> 02:19.005
for the countryside....

02:19.005 --> 02:20.273
- [Man 2] That's what I've been telling you.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.674
There's no feasible containment strategy.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.909
Absolutely none.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.110
- [News Reporter 3] Record numbers,

02:24.110 --> 02:25.578
and riots are reported across the nation.

02:25.578 --> 02:26.779
- [News Reporter 4] Comes days after the release

02:26.779 --> 02:28.848
of viral footage showing what appears

02:28.848 --> 02:30.850
to be a group of infected civilians

02:30.850 --> 02:32.752
attacking a military patrol.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.420
- [Woman] There's something really wrong with people.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.822
We need to get out of here.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.789
- [Man 1] Military drones have been deployed

02:36.789 --> 02:37.957
across the country in accordance

02:37.957 --> 02:40.960
with the new Eradication Act.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.529
- [Woman] They're not letting anyone leave.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.430
If anyone leaves their home, the drones are killing them.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.331
- [Woman 2] It doesn't matter.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.833
We have to go now.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.800
- [Woman 3] Please, you have to let us out of here.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.501
- [Man 3] Servers are down.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.437
Communications are going down across the board.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.706
- [Woman 4] They don't come out in daylight,

02:53.706 --> 02:55.041
but it's getting dark.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.277
- [Man 3] There's no easy way to say this.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.611
- [Woman 2] If anyone can hear this, please help us.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.813
- [Man 2] This is an S.O.S.

03:00.813 --> 03:04.551
- [Man] But this will be our final broadcast.

03:08.454 --> 03:13.459

03:14.727 --> 03:17.730
(computer beeping)

03:27.574 --> 03:29.008
- Hey, can you see me?

03:29.008 --> 03:31.578
- Yes, I can see you. Can you see me?

03:31.578 --> 03:33.913
- Yeah, I can see you. Yeah, it's working.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.248
- Yay.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.182
- Hi. - How are you?

03:36.182 --> 03:37.717
Did you get back okay?

03:37.717 --> 03:38.685
- Mm-hm.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.487
Yeah. Yes, settled back.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.022
How about you? How is it?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.325
- It's great.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.593
I mean, it's beautiful. It's very different.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.896
Just being here by myself, but yeah,

03:49.896 --> 03:51.698
really looking forward to having you up here.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.337
- Well, actually, it's going to take

03:57.337 --> 03:59.005
a little longer than we thought.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.875
- Do you know how much longer?

04:03.943 --> 04:06.246
- Well, we're going to have to do

04:06.246 --> 04:09.015
a lot more testing to figure out a treatment, so...

04:11.751 --> 04:13.553
As long as it takes. (chuckles)

04:13.553 --> 04:15.455
Did you find the phlebotomy equipment, by the way?

04:15.455 --> 04:16.456
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.290
I got it.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.892
Not great with needles

04:19.892 --> 04:24.764
but I've got these track marks to make a junkie proud.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.534
Glad that no one can see me out here.

04:28.534 --> 04:29.969
- You'll be fine.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.708
- How you doing? You okay?

04:37.810 --> 04:39.879
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

04:39.879 --> 04:40.713
Just...

04:42.615 --> 04:43.883
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.887
(Sam coughs)

04:47.887 --> 04:49.122
- I actually have to go.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.824
- Okay. - Yeah, my boss needs me.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.426
- All right.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.661
See you soon.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.728
- Yeah.

04:55.728 --> 04:56.796
- I love you.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.333
- I love you, too.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.708
(tense music)

05:47.180 --> 05:48.881
- [Sam] Dear David...

05:49.782 --> 05:52.385
(egg timer ringing)

05:52.385 --> 05:54.053
By now, you should be settled in.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.793
I hope you're comfortable

06:00.793 --> 06:04.230
because we need you to stay isolated.

06:05.398 --> 06:08.067
(egg timers ticking)

06:08.067 --> 06:10.636
(egg timer ringing)

06:10.636 --> 06:12.839
You'll need to keep a strict daily schedule.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.041
Keep yourself healthy.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.911
Check yourself every day for symptoms.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.850
(tense music)

06:32.925 --> 06:35.862
(egg timer ringing)

06:35.862 --> 06:37.997
(ax thuds) (wood cracks)

06:37.997 --> 06:40.733
The virus you're infected with has killed every other person

06:40.733 --> 06:42.335
who's come into contact with it.

06:46.272 --> 06:47.407
Everyone except you.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.578
(tense music)

06:59.585 --> 07:02.722
I'll be at the Eradication Control Center in D.C.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.425
My job is to study your blood.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.063
It could be the key to saving us all.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.736
(tense music)

07:24.977 --> 07:29.415
It's a mess out there, David, and it's getting worse.

07:37.723 --> 07:39.091
Stay isolated.

07:41.994 --> 07:46.999
(tense music) (birds chirping)

08:01.514 --> 08:06.519

(tense music)

09:08.214 --> 09:11.317
(egg timers ticking)

09:20.259 --> 09:22.562
It's hard to be so far away from you,

09:26.766 --> 09:29.201
but right now we don't have a choice.

09:30.836 --> 09:34.340
(egg timer ringing)

09:34.340 --> 09:37.577
(generator starts up)

10:03.936 --> 10:04.971
I'll call every day.

10:24.924 --> 10:29.895
(insects buzzing) (soft tense music)

10:30.796 --> 10:31.931
One last thing, David....

10:38.938 --> 10:41.807
Never, ever go out after dark.

10:44.577 --> 10:49.515
(insects buzzing) (tense dramatic music)

10:50.416 --> 10:51.250
I miss you.

10:53.919 --> 10:58.924
(tense music) (insects buzzing)

11:08.100 --> 11:12.505
(guttural screaming in the distance)

11:22.014 --> 11:25.117
(egg timers ticking)

11:36.028 --> 11:40.299
- It's so funny, I had this dream that, um...

11:40.299 --> 11:41.300
Oh, I dunno.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.637
It's hard to, to...

11:51.977 --> 11:54.480
(David sighs)

12:58.544 --> 13:01.714
(phone line trilling)

13:08.721 --> 13:10.923
- [Man] Hello, you've reached the Beaumont family.

13:10.923 --> 13:11.824
This is Tim-

13:11.824 --> 13:12.658
- [Woman] And Julie.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.226

(phone ringing)

15:00.165 --> 15:01.000
- Hello?

15:03.168 --> 15:04.837
- [Man] Who is this?

15:06.839 --> 15:09.341
(tense music)

15:13.545 --> 15:14.380
Hello?

15:16.348 --> 15:18.684
(egg timer ringing)

15:18.684 --> 15:22.421
(line drops) - Hello?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.255
Fuck.

15:24.456 --> 15:25.758
(computer beeping)

15:25.758 --> 15:26.592
Shit.

15:30.129 --> 15:33.032
(egg time ringing)

15:35.401 --> 15:37.303
(computer beeping)

15:37.303 --> 15:39.104
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:39.104 --> 15:39.939
No.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.675
(drone buzzing overhead)

19:23.529 --> 19:25.097
- I'm a vegetarian!

19:26.331 --> 19:27.132
Wha...

19:29.201 --> 19:31.870
(drone buzzing)

19:35.807 --> 19:38.477
(cans thudding)

19:41.680 --> 19:43.148
Okay.

19:43.148 --> 19:44.716
Fine.

Lovely.

20:04.069 --> 20:09.074
(drone buzzing) (birds chirping)

20:26.325 --> 20:29.828
"Virus is a bloodborne pathogen."

20:29.828 --> 20:30.596
Uh huh.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.168
"Drones are for your protection."

20:38.604 --> 20:42.274
(egg timer ringing)

20:42.274 --> 20:45.177
(computer beeping)

20:57.789 --> 20:59.124
- [Sam] What are you doing?

21:00.559 --> 21:02.628
- Sam. - This isn't a game, David.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.229
Do you understand that?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.464
- Yeah.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.432
- There cannot be any interruption.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.635
It's, it's really dangerous.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.571
Do you understand, your blood is our only hope for a cure.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.208
- Sam, are you in trouble?

21:20.379 --> 21:22.447
- You have to make the drop.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.482
- Okay.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.650
- Yeah. - Fill another bag.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.819
- I already did one today.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.588
- I need you to do one right now, David.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.493
David, if they don't get it within 48 hours-

21:34.493 --> 21:35.761
- Yeah, okay, okay.

21:35.761 --> 21:36.762
I'll do it, just stay on the line.

21:36.762 --> 21:37.562
Stay on...

21:42.501 --> 21:45.137
(vials clatter)

21:47.806 --> 21:48.607
Yeah.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.855
(tense music)

22:09.795 --> 22:11.196
Sam, I trust you.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.933
You can talk to me. What's going on?

22:19.705 --> 22:22.474
(Sam sighs)

22:22.474 --> 22:24.376
- The rules are there to protect you.

22:24.376 --> 22:27.713
Stick to the routine. Don't take any risks.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.314
Stay isolated.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.014
- [Man] Hello?

23:11.022 --> 23:11.857
- Who is this?

23:15.994 --> 23:17.662
- [Man] Who are you?

23:24.736 --> 23:25.570
- Beaumont?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.943
Is this Beaumont in Meadow Lakes?

23:35.447 --> 23:36.281
- [Man] No.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.290
How did you get this number? - Are you in Meadow Lakes?

23:47.292 --> 23:49.127
- [Man] Yeah, what's left of it.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.599
I thought I was only one here- - Where'd you come from?

23:54.599 --> 23:55.934
- [Man] Atlanta.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.538
Nothing there, either.

24:01.373 --> 24:05.043
Look, it's getting dark.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.411
It's not safe for us to talk.

24:06.411 --> 24:07.879
They could hear me- - Just you?

24:09.815 --> 24:12.050
- [Man] Yeah. Just me now.

24:18.056 --> 24:18.924
What's your name?

24:21.560 --> 24:23.995
- David.

24:23.995 --> 24:25.597
- [Man] David.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.165
I'm Todd.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.600
- How'd you end up here?

24:31.002 --> 24:32.237
- [Todd] I was in Atlanta

24:32.237 --> 24:34.005
when they lost control of the infection.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.742
Government drones appeared out of the sky

24:37.742 --> 24:40.679
and people were cheering, calling for help,

24:40.679 --> 24:42.681
thought that they were there to save us.

24:44.983 --> 24:49.921
Then the gas, hissin', like timber rattlers.

24:53.425 --> 24:56.127
I had a rebreather on, working insulation.

24:56.127 --> 24:59.164
Most weren't that lucky.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.668
You know, even before then you could see

25:03.668 --> 25:05.270
things were getting worse.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.708
People were losing everything,

25:09.708 --> 25:14.045
but I, I always had the same thought:

25:15.614 --> 25:18.984
to hell with them, it's not gonna happen to me.

25:20.886 --> 25:25.891
Then along comes this higher power.

25:28.860 --> 25:33.298
Do you realize you're nothin'?

25:35.867 --> 25:38.403
(Todd scoffs)

25:38.403 --> 25:41.072
I'm ramblin'. I'm ramblin' at it.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.408
It's been a while since I had anything to eat.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.480
Look, David...

25:50.882 --> 25:53.518
I know you don't know me.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.223
You've got no reason to trust me, but I could work.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.058
Earn my keep- - You can't come here.

26:01.660 --> 26:02.694
- I didn't mean that-

26:02.694 --> 26:05.997
- No, you can't be close to me.

26:05.997 --> 26:06.898
I'm infected.

26:09.868 --> 26:13.605
It doesn't affect me, but um, it would kill you,

26:13.605 --> 26:14.873
so you can't come here.

26:16.908 --> 26:17.776
I'm sorry.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.879
- [Todd] You tested to be sure?

26:25.550 --> 26:26.384
- What?

26:29.454 --> 26:31.690
- [Todd] How long you been isolated up there?

26:33.391 --> 26:34.225
- 24 months.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.295
- Eradication control people put out

26:37.295 --> 26:39.297
at home tests towards the end.

26:39.297 --> 26:41.433
I mean, they were in every drug store.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.402
Didn't help much at that point,

26:44.402 --> 26:48.139
but you could find out for sure.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.778
(tense music)

27:01.086 --> 27:06.091
(insects buzzing) (birds chirping)

27:35.353 --> 27:38.123
(birds chirping)

28:42.687 --> 28:46.091
(device clicks) (David grunts)

28:46.091 --> 28:48.593
(blood drips)

28:59.704 --> 29:04.209
(wind chimes ringing in the distance)

29:19.290 --> 29:23.795
(wind chimes ringing in the distance)

29:36.641 --> 29:39.410
(water sloshing)

30:16.748 --> 30:19.317
(man coughing)

30:24.122 --> 30:26.024
(David panting)

30:26.024 --> 30:26.991
- Stay back.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.494
(man coughs) Stay back.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.295
Hey.

30:31.696 --> 30:32.530
Hey, stay back!

30:32.530 --> 30:33.798
Stay back, I'm infected.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.506
(man coughs)

30:43.341 --> 30:46.144
(tongue clicking)

30:48.279 --> 30:51.216
(man screams)

30:51.216 --> 30:52.483
(water splashes)

30:52.483 --> 30:55.720
(man screams)

30:55.720 --> 30:58.223
(arrow thuds)

30:59.357 --> 31:04.362
(tense dramatic music) (water splashing)

31:09.901 --> 31:12.704
(David grunting)

31:18.643 --> 31:21.913
(tense dramatic music)

31:26.050 --> 31:28.920
(sick man grunts)

31:28.920 --> 31:32.891
(arrow thuds) (body thuds)

31:32.891 --> 31:36.094
(tense dramatic music)

31:37.228 --> 31:40.031
(water splashing)

31:46.571 --> 31:51.442
(tense dramatic music) (David panting)

32:03.087 --> 32:05.757
(David panting)

32:09.727 --> 32:12.130
(door thuds)

32:14.699 --> 32:17.302
(match lights)

32:20.905 --> 32:25.910
(David panting) (tense music)

32:27.812 --> 32:29.380
Oh, fucking stupid.

32:31.082 --> 32:32.317
So fucking stupid.

32:32.317 --> 32:33.418
Oh, so fucking stupid.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.252
Oh, fuck.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.556
(David mumbling)

32:38.556 --> 32:41.960
(David breathes heavily)

32:46.297 --> 32:48.099
It's okay, it's okay.

32:50.101 --> 32:55.106
(David mumbles) (tense music)

33:08.953 --> 33:11.689
(birds chirping)

34:01.906 --> 34:05.910
(drone buzzing in the distance)

34:20.324 --> 34:22.260
(tense music) (egg timers ticking)

34:22.260 --> 34:23.528
- I know this is hard,

34:23.528 --> 34:25.363
but you still have to keep to the routine.

34:25.363 --> 34:30.368
(David panting) (tense music)

34:31.102 --> 34:33.438
(egg timer ringing)

34:35.273 --> 34:38.276
(egg timer ringing)

34:41.779 --> 34:44.782
(egg timer ringing)

34:45.783 --> 34:48.853
(egg timers ringing)

34:52.590 --> 34:53.624
Hi.

34:53.624 --> 34:58.262
(ax thudding) (wood cracking)

34:58.262 --> 34:59.430
You'll do fine.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.300
(ax thuds) (wood cracks)

35:02.300 --> 35:06.304
(drone buzzing in the distance)

35:11.642 --> 35:14.312
(woods thuds)

35:14.312 --> 35:17.315
(egg timer ringing)

35:18.483 --> 35:19.484
Actually...

35:21.486 --> 35:25.490
It's going to take a little longer than we thought.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.758
I'll see you soon. (egg timers ringing)

35:27.758 --> 35:28.593
David?

35:29.594 --> 35:30.828
David?

35:30.828 --> 35:31.796
I love you.

35:33.731 --> 35:38.736
(egg timers ticking) (tense music)

35:53.451 --> 35:55.786
(Sam sighs)

35:55.786 --> 35:57.188
Would you look at that view?

35:59.123 --> 36:00.758
I always loved this place in the summer.

36:00.758 --> 36:01.592
- Yeah.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.696
(Sam humming)

36:05.696 --> 36:10.034
- [Sam] Hey, have you seen, have you seen the sugar?

36:15.106 --> 36:16.607
- You're not real.

36:20.044 --> 36:23.147
(egg timer ringing)

36:27.051 --> 36:28.052
- [Sam] Turn it off.

36:31.389 --> 36:32.890
- Shut up, shut up, go away.

36:32.890 --> 36:33.958
(Sam chuckles)

36:33.958 --> 36:34.859
- Or what?

36:36.060 --> 36:37.895
It's not like you can make me.

36:39.063 --> 36:40.698
Like you could ever stand up to me.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.070
(Sam sighs)

36:47.004 --> 36:49.073
I know that look.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.576
That desperate look in your eye,

36:51.576 --> 36:54.212
every time you'd come to me.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.913
Not for support or validation,

36:55.913 --> 36:58.749
you'd come to me so that I'd lie to you

36:59.917 --> 37:03.087
to tell you it's all right, you're good.

37:03.087 --> 37:04.355
Your failures aren't your fault.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.557
Your success is right around the corner.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.261
But nothing I or anyone else could say

37:10.261 --> 37:15.266
will change the simple truth that you are a coward.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.270
You have spent your entire life waiting for permission,

37:19.270 --> 37:21.439
permission to eat, permission to breathe,

37:21.439 --> 37:22.940
permission to fuck.

37:22.940 --> 37:26.844
Without me to tell you what to do, you are nothing.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.346
Now turn it off.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.615
- Shut up!

37:30.615 --> 37:33.551
(items clattering)

38:00.244 --> 38:03.247
(egg timer ringing)

38:20.665 --> 38:25.670
(soft piano music) (egg timers ticking)

38:30.574 --> 38:33.511
(soft piano music)

38:50.695 --> 38:52.697
(ax thuds) (David grunts)

38:52.697 --> 38:55.366
(David panting)

39:02.039 --> 39:04.642
(David grunts)

39:08.446 --> 39:13.451
(birds chirping) (tense music)

39:45.416 --> 39:48.252
(David laughing)

39:57.862 --> 39:58.696
Oh, fuck.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.374
- Oh God.

40:10.374 --> 40:12.943
I told you not to be out after sundown.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.281
You can't leave the house anymore, David. It's not safe.

40:22.286 --> 40:27.224
- The man I saw, there was something wrong with him,

40:27.224 --> 40:29.059
like he lost his mind.

40:31.395 --> 40:32.263
- Did he bite you?

40:33.798 --> 40:35.032
This is important, David.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.802
Did he bite you or touch you in any way?

40:37.802 --> 40:38.736
- No.

40:38.736 --> 40:41.038
(Sam sighs)

40:41.038 --> 40:41.806
- That's good.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.378
- What does this disease do to people?

40:49.146 --> 40:50.614
- I...

40:50.614 --> 40:52.550
I can't say anything else right now,

40:52.550 --> 40:54.919
but we're gonna clean this up.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.558
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything,

41:00.558 --> 41:04.061
but we made a breakthrough.

41:07.565 --> 41:11.335
We're close, David, to finding a cure for you.

41:12.503 --> 41:13.337
A vaccine.

41:15.406 --> 41:18.409
Just a little bit longer and we can be together again.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.680
I want that so much.

41:24.849 --> 41:25.683
Don't you?

41:30.187 --> 41:32.189
- Sam, you're sure I'm infected?

41:37.127 --> 41:40.364
- Promise me you won't leave the house again, David.

41:45.302 --> 41:46.770
- Yeah. Of course.

41:51.141 --> 41:55.145
(drone buzzing in the distance)

41:59.850 --> 42:02.720
(soft tense music)

42:11.896 --> 42:16.901
(drone buzzes in the distance) (soft tense music)

42:32.583 --> 42:37.588
(soft tense music) (birds chirping)

42:42.927 --> 42:45.563
(drone buzzing)

42:59.843 --> 43:04.848
(soft tense music) (birds chirping)

43:32.409 --> 43:34.912
(tense music)

43:51.662 --> 43:54.932
(tense dramatic music)

44:12.316 --> 44:17.321
(flies buzzing) (birds chirping)

44:34.538 --> 44:37.207
(flies buzzing)

44:38.776 --> 44:41.445
(David panting)

44:58.128 --> 45:00.898
(birds chirping)

45:11.508 --> 45:14.845
(drone buzzes overhead)

45:25.589 --> 45:30.594
(tense dramatic music) (birds chirping)

46:20.277 --> 46:24.381
(tense dramatic music continues)

46:52.676 --> 46:53.510
(Sam gasps)

46:53.510 --> 46:54.778
- Sam? - No!

46:54.778 --> 46:56.013
No!

46:56.013 --> 46:57.181
- What is this? What are you doing here?

46:57.181 --> 46:58.348
- Stay away, stay back.

46:58.348 --> 46:59.183
- Hey.

46:59.183 --> 47:00.450
Hey, it's okay.

47:02.252 --> 47:03.587
Hey, it's okay.

47:05.789 --> 47:06.924
I'm not infected.

47:12.196 --> 47:13.030
- I am.

47:19.269 --> 47:23.440
(insects buzzing in the distance)

47:42.726 --> 47:44.895
Don't. Don't come near me.

48:06.750 --> 48:09.086
(Sam sighs)

48:13.724 --> 48:15.726
- Why did you lie to me?

48:18.428 --> 48:19.363
- I had to.

48:21.265 --> 48:22.666
To protect you.

48:22.666 --> 48:24.935
- I don't understand.

48:24.935 --> 48:25.769
- I know.

48:27.871 --> 48:29.539
I knew you wouldn't.

48:31.208 --> 48:33.377
That's why I had to do it.

48:33.377 --> 48:34.611
- Then help me.

48:37.080 --> 48:37.915
- I can't

48:42.586 --> 48:43.420
- Please.

48:59.603 --> 49:02.539
(Sam sighs)

49:02.539 --> 49:05.108
(Sam sniffles)

49:12.983 --> 49:15.953
- I've missed you so much.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.321
- It's okay.

49:17.321 --> 49:19.656
It's okay, you're here now.

49:26.063 --> 49:28.498
- I made a deal with dangerous people, David.

49:32.336 --> 49:33.170
They're...

49:36.440 --> 49:38.675
They're killing everybody who's infected.

49:39.943 --> 49:41.678
- [David] The Eradication Program?

49:41.678 --> 49:42.512
- Yes.

49:43.847 --> 49:45.449
- There's no cure.

49:45.449 --> 49:46.283
- We tried.

49:48.151 --> 49:50.520
It all fell apart so fast.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.189
The infection rates were too high,

49:52.189 --> 49:54.624
then they just started wiping everyone out.

49:56.426 --> 49:59.029
It was all I could do to keep us alive.

49:59.029 --> 50:00.263
- You should've told me.

50:02.632 --> 50:05.369
- You couldn't have handled it, David.

50:05.369 --> 50:07.504
I just, I was trying to protect you

50:11.041 --> 50:14.711
because, because they're watching.

50:14.711 --> 50:15.979
They're always watching.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.715
Oh, if they found out I was here, they'll...

50:19.950 --> 50:20.784
They'll...

50:22.119 --> 50:22.953
- It's okay.

50:27.057 --> 50:28.291
We're not sick.

50:28.291 --> 50:29.993
They have no reason to us, right?

50:33.897 --> 50:34.798
- You're bleeding.

50:38.201 --> 50:39.002
- It's nothing.

50:40.370 --> 50:41.304
Sam, what's wrong?.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.076
- I'm so hungry, David.

50:49.679 --> 50:51.915
- Okay, we're together now, so it'll be okay.

50:53.550 --> 50:54.518
- No.

50:54.518 --> 50:55.485
No.

50:55.485 --> 50:57.421
No, I, I gotta go back.

50:57.421 --> 50:59.523
- What? - I gotta go back, David.

50:59.523 --> 51:00.590
I can't be here.

51:00.590 --> 51:01.925
I gotta follow the rules.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.195
I have to go back or else...

51:05.195 --> 51:07.064
Oh, I feel it coming.

51:08.932 --> 51:11.168
I...

51:11.168 --> 51:12.235
I'm sick, David.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.446
- You said I was sick, remember?

51:24.281 --> 51:25.115
I'm not.

51:29.186 --> 51:30.687
- You don't believe me?

51:40.464 --> 51:41.431
- All right.

51:44.134 --> 51:44.935
- Yeah?

51:46.103 --> 51:47.637
Thank you.

51:47.637 --> 51:48.438
Thank you.

51:53.944 --> 51:54.778
(Sam sobbing)

51:54.778 --> 51:56.780
- [David] It'll be okay.

51:59.649 --> 52:00.984
(blade slices) (Sam gasps)

52:00.984 --> 52:02.619
It's gonna be okay.

52:03.453 --> 52:04.821
- David?

52:04.821 --> 52:06.123
David, no.

52:06.123 --> 52:07.157
David.

52:07.157 --> 52:08.325
David.

52:08.325 --> 52:09.392
David, no! (banging on door)

52:09.392 --> 52:11.261
Don't leave me, David.

52:11.261 --> 52:12.095
David.

52:13.096 --> 52:14.464
Please don't go.

52:14.464 --> 52:15.799
You have to listen to me.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.068
They're watching us. David!

52:20.303 --> 52:23.240
(soft tense music)

52:42.192 --> 52:44.828
(David panting)

52:54.771 --> 52:59.709
- Sam? (soft music)

53:00.844 --> 53:02.212
It's gonna be all right.

53:04.314 --> 53:07.384
You're not sick. You're just confused, okay?

53:07.384 --> 53:08.885
You need food and rest.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.354
- David.

53:13.290 --> 53:15.992
- [David] Yeah?

53:15.992 --> 53:18.828
- Please. Please don't do this.

53:20.230 --> 53:21.064
Just...

53:22.799 --> 53:24.167
Just let me go back.

53:32.075 --> 53:33.476
- I'll be back with food soon.

53:33.476 --> 53:35.345
Try and get some rest.

53:37.080 --> 53:40.350
(phone line trilling)

53:41.918 --> 53:44.221
- [Tim] Hello, you've reached the Beaumont family.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.088
This is Tim-

53:45.088 --> 53:46.089
- [Julie] And Julie.

53:46.089 --> 53:47.724
- [Stephanie] And Stephanie.

53:47.724 --> 53:50.193
- [Tim] leave us a message and call you right back.

53:51.661 --> 53:55.498
(insects buzzing) (tense music)

53:55.498 --> 53:56.666
- Hey, it's...

53:58.034 --> 53:58.868
Um...

54:00.403 --> 54:01.905
I'm not infected.

54:07.611 --> 54:09.746
I think you should come here.

54:09.746 --> 54:13.516
I think that we'll all be safer together.

54:18.221 --> 54:20.190
I don't know if you have a map,

54:20.190 --> 54:25.195
but we are at 44 degrees, five minutes, 15 seconds by, um...

54:26.963 --> 54:31.735
74 degrees, five minutes, 30 seconds.

54:34.070 --> 54:37.374
Bye. (phone thuds)

54:37.374 --> 54:42.379
(tense music) (insects buzzing)

54:59.829 --> 55:02.499
(David panting)

55:47.544 --> 55:52.515
(insects buzzing) (birds chirping)

56:14.070 --> 56:15.638
Hey, can you see me?

56:15.638 --> 56:18.241
- Yes, I can see you. Can you see me?

56:18.241 --> 56:19.075
- Yeah. I can see you.

56:19.075 --> 56:20.877
Yeah, it's working.

56:20.877 --> 56:21.711
- [Sam] Yay.

56:21.711 --> 56:22.746
Hi. - Hi.

56:22.746 --> 56:24.414
Did you get back okay?

56:24.414 --> 56:25.248
- [Sam] Mm-hm.

56:25.248 --> 56:26.082
Yeah.

56:27.650 --> 56:29.085
I actually have to go.

56:29.085 --> 56:31.755
Yeah, my uh, boss needs me.

56:31.755 --> 56:33.323
- [David] All right.

56:33.323 --> 56:34.557
- [Sam] Okay.

56:34.557 --> 56:35.925
- [David] All right, I'll see you soon.

56:35.925 --> 56:36.993
- Yeah, okay.

56:36.993 --> 56:38.995
- All right, I love you.

56:40.096 --> 56:40.997
- I love you, too.

56:53.777 --> 56:54.677
Listen to me.

56:56.579 --> 56:58.548
I will keep him safe and isolated.

56:59.549 --> 57:01.518
He'll send me clean blood,

57:01.518 --> 57:02.786
enough to suppress my symptoms

57:02.786 --> 57:05.121
and I'll send the rest to you via drone.

57:06.289 --> 57:08.091
I know you need it as much as I do,

57:08.091 --> 57:10.226
but you will keep your side of the bargain.

57:11.628 --> 57:13.797
I know you're killing anyone who's infected.

57:15.465 --> 57:16.366
You need me.

57:18.101 --> 57:19.636
I'm the only one he trusts.

57:22.972 --> 57:26.109
Do we have a deal? (tense music)

57:29.946 --> 57:32.782
(computer beeps)

57:44.894 --> 57:46.296
Everything's going smoothly.

57:48.064 --> 57:50.834
I've been hunting the ones who get too close.

57:50.834 --> 57:51.801
They come at night.

57:55.138 --> 57:57.173
It almost seems like they know he's here.

57:59.576 --> 58:01.778
I'm worried he's starting to suspect something.

58:03.646 --> 58:05.014
He's withholding his blood.

58:06.850 --> 58:10.019
Part of me just wants to go to him and...

58:11.521 --> 58:12.355
Don't worry.

58:13.957 --> 58:15.024
He will cooperate.

58:19.496 --> 58:21.030
Ah, it's getting worse.

58:21.030 --> 58:23.299
I can feel it crawling in my cells.

58:24.601 --> 58:25.435
(Sam gasps)

58:25.435 --> 58:27.303
Extreme vasodilation...

58:27.303 --> 58:28.838
(Sam groans)

58:28.838 --> 58:29.706
Inflammation.

58:32.542 --> 58:34.511
(tense dramatic music)

58:34.511 --> 58:36.546
I won't turn into one of them.

58:40.383 --> 58:41.985
I need blood soon.

58:44.287 --> 58:46.789
(tense music)

58:53.563 --> 58:54.397
- Okay...

58:57.033 --> 59:00.637
(computer beeping)

59:00.637 --> 59:01.471
- Sam.

59:03.072 --> 59:05.875
(Sam whimpering)

59:09.078 --> 59:10.246
- [Sam] David.

59:12.682 --> 59:15.084
Hurry. - Okay, I'm coming, Sam.

59:15.084 --> 59:17.987
(computer beeping)

59:24.861 --> 59:27.597
(drone clicking)

59:31.100 --> 59:33.770
(drone buzzing)

59:34.771 --> 59:37.273
(tense music)

59:38.541 --> 59:39.542
Who are you?

59:40.777 --> 59:43.446
(drone buzzing)

59:45.782 --> 59:48.618
What the fuck do you want from us?

59:52.188 --> 59:57.193
(tense dramatic music) (drone buzzing)

1:00:13.309 --> 1:00:16.412
(drone whirring)

1:00:16.412 --> 1:00:18.982
(gas spraying)

1:00:25.655 --> 1:00:28.157
(David gasps)

1:00:31.094 --> 1:00:33.730
(David choking)

1:00:44.841 --> 1:00:48.344
(David breathing heavily)

1:00:54.784 --> 1:00:57.453
(drone buzzing)

1:01:03.126 --> 1:01:06.362
(tense dramatic music)

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:17.340
(David coughing) (David panting)

1:01:18.708 --> 1:01:22.045
(drone buzzes overhead)

1:01:31.854 --> 1:01:36.859
(David panting) (tense music)

1:02:10.059 --> 1:02:15.064
(drone buzzing) (tense dramatic music)

1:02:23.773 --> 1:02:26.342
(arrows thuds)

1:02:26.342 --> 1:02:29.779
(blade slices) (David grunts)

1:02:29.779 --> 1:02:32.048

1:02:51.901 --> 1:02:55.905
(David groaning) (bone cracks)

1:02:55.905 --> 1:02:56.739
Fuck.

1:02:57.607 --> 1:03:00.276
(David panting)

1:03:05.882 --> 1:03:06.716
Fuck.

1:03:10.319 --> 1:03:13.055
(David grunting)

1:03:18.928 --> 1:03:21.664
(birds chirping)

1:03:23.099 --> 1:03:25.768

1:03:40.616 --> 1:03:43.352
(David panting)

1:03:54.363 --> 1:03:55.198
Sam!

1:03:57.333 --> 1:03:58.167
Sam!

1:04:04.674 --> 1:04:07.343
(David panting)

1:04:20.189 --> 1:04:22.725
(David groans)

1:04:24.193 --> 1:04:26.863

1:04:59.328 --> 1:05:01.597
(blade slices) (David yelps)

1:05:01.597 --> 1:05:03.699
(David groans)

1:05:03.699 --> 1:05:06.369
(David panting)

1:08:03.345 --> 1:08:06.015

(Sam thuds) (Sam gasps)

1:08:56.999 --> 1:08:59.435
(Sam snarls)

1:09:02.738 --> 1:09:05.107
(Sam clicking tongue) (Sam snarls)

1:09:05.107 --> 1:09:07.610
(Sam screams)

1:09:10.913 --> 1:09:13.582
(David panting)

1:09:25.094 --> 1:09:25.928
- Sam?

1:09:38.874 --> 1:09:39.708
Sorry.

1:09:44.380 --> 1:09:48.317
(drone buzzes in the distance)

1:09:49.385 --> 1:09:51.554
Sam, I can give you blood.

1:09:52.888 --> 1:09:55.124
Things will go back to how they were, okay?

1:09:55.124 --> 1:09:56.792
I can give you some.

1:10:23.586 --> 1:10:26.088
(tense music)

1:10:34.263 --> 1:10:37.266
(Sam softly snarls)

1:10:43.439 --> 1:10:46.442
(Sam clicks tongue)

1:11:03.692 --> 1:11:06.695
(Sam softly snarls)

1:11:16.472 --> 1:11:19.475
(Sam softly snarls)

1:11:35.457 --> 1:11:38.093
(David panting)

1:11:46.402 --> 1:11:47.503
(footsteps thudding) (Sam snarls)

1:11:47.503 --> 1:11:49.471
(Sam clicks tongue)

1:11:49.471 --> 1:11:52.141
(Sam whimpering)

1:12:04.687 --> 1:12:09.692
(David breathing heavily) (Sam whimpering)

1:12:18.667 --> 1:12:21.103
(Sam snarls)

1:12:23.372 --> 1:12:27.142

1:14:17.319 --> 1:14:19.822
(Sam sobbing)

1:14:26.595 --> 1:14:27.429
- David...

1:14:32.501 --> 1:14:36.071
(Sam clicks tongue)

1:14:36.071 --> 1:14:39.575
(David breathing heavily)

1:17:25.507 --> 1:17:27.976
(soft music)

1:18:10.519 --> 1:18:13.221
(birds chirping)

1:18:14.723 --> 1:18:19.728

1:20:51.479 --> 1:20:54.983
(drones buzzing overhead)

1:21:17.172 --> 1:21:19.574
(door thuds)

1:21:22.077 --> 1:21:24.579
(door creaks)

1:21:35.690 --> 1:21:38.760
(man softly panting)

1:22:23.371 --> 1:22:24.973
- Thank you, David.

1:22:37.752 --> 1:22:40.755
(egg timer ringing)

1:23:24.165 --> 1:23:28.003
(egg timer continues ringing)

1:23:31.039 --> 1:23:33.808
(computer beeps)

1:23:37.278 --> 1:23:38.113
David?

1:23:40.882 --> 1:23:42.017
Is that you?

1:23:46.988 --> 1:23:50.392
- My name, um, my name is Dr. Chambers.

1:23:52.527 --> 1:23:53.328
- Where's David?

1:23:55.663 --> 1:23:56.564
- David left.

1:23:58.033 --> 1:23:58.900
- Is he all right?

1:24:00.235 --> 1:24:01.536
- Yeah.

1:24:01.536 --> 1:24:04.039
Yeah, they found a treatment for him.

1:24:04.039 --> 1:24:07.842
He, uh, he left to D.C. to be with his wife.

1:24:10.245 --> 1:24:12.313
I'm afraid we have some bad news, though.

1:24:13.415 --> 1:24:15.250
The previous generation of tests was flawed.

1:24:15.250 --> 1:24:18.253
From what we know now, it seems that everybody out there

1:24:18.253 --> 1:24:21.356
who's still alive is an asymptomatic carrier.

1:24:21.356 --> 1:24:22.557
We believe you are, too.

1:24:26.428 --> 1:24:28.430
But we can start working on a treatment
