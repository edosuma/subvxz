00:12.263 --> 00:13.628
Right now

00:13.731 --> 00:17.827
terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:17.969 --> 00:20.597
My wife and daughter have been targeted

00:20.705 --> 00:24.232
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:24.842 --> 00:27.106
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer

00:27.312 --> 00:30.804
and today is the longest day of my life.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.958
It's official.
The polls have just closed...

00:48.066 --> 00:50.466
...minutes ago in California,
and the big story:

00:50.568 --> 00:53.628
Senator David Palmer
seems to have swept California...

00:53.738 --> 00:54.898
...and every other state...

00:55.006 --> 00:56.974
...that held a primary
this super Tuesday.

00:57.075 --> 00:59.942
It looks like he may have gotten a boost
in the late vote...

01:00.044 --> 01:02.569
...based on the roller coaster events
of his day.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.911
This evening, the Senator
held an emergency press conference...

01:06.017 --> 01:09.145
...to disclose the details of the scandal
involving both his son...

01:09.254 --> 01:11.154
...and his primary financial backers.

01:11.289 --> 01:15.020
Palmer claims to have been unaware
of any wrongdoing until recently.

02:00.238 --> 02:01.535
You're in my seat.

02:03.141 --> 02:04.199
Fine.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.285
I said that's my seat.

02:38.142 --> 02:39.571
- How about you?
- Well..

02:39.677 --> 02:41.941
Would you excuse us for a moment?

02:42.046 --> 02:43.843
Thanks a lot. I'll see you soon.

02:43.948 --> 02:45.745
11 for 11, my friend.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.784
- Congratulations. You did it.
- We did it.

02:50.121 --> 02:51.588
That's not the best part.

02:51.689 --> 02:54.123
Fox News just did an instant poll.

02:54.225 --> 02:58.093
83% approve of the way you
handled the Ferragamo situation.

02:58.997 --> 03:00.328
That is great.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.692
Have we heard from Ames or his people?

03:04.802 --> 03:08.363
They're all too busy running for cover
and we don't want to get cocky...

03:08.706 --> 03:11.903
...but so far, it couldn't
have turned out better.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.346
Everyone, listen up.

03:24.188 --> 03:27.055
In a bit, I'm going to give a speech
to the country.

03:27.158 --> 03:30.491
We have a number of primaries
in the coming months...

03:30.595 --> 03:32.620
...so technically
it's not a victory speech.

03:34.165 --> 03:36.633
But I'm going to make it
sound like one anyway.

03:39.137 --> 03:40.729
Yeah! All right!

03:41.439 --> 03:42.929
As you know...

03:43.041 --> 03:46.568
...in many ways, this has been
a difficult day for my family...

03:46.678 --> 03:51.138
...and I'm confident that being open
and honest was the right thing to do.

03:51.249 --> 03:55.208
And that things will be resolved fairly
for everyone concerned...

03:55.353 --> 03:57.321
...and in the meantime...

03:58.156 --> 04:00.852
...I want to thank everyone
in this room for their support.

04:02.660 --> 04:03.991
This is our victory.

04:06.364 --> 04:07.956
This is our night!

04:10.268 --> 04:13.032
And I just want to give one last order...

04:13.237 --> 04:16.206
...which will be obeyed,
with no exceptions whatsoever.

04:17.642 --> 04:19.200
Enjoy the rest of the evening!

04:23.114 --> 04:26.550
Division wants an update on the Palmer
threat-assessment in a half hour.

04:26.651 --> 04:29.347
With Alexis under control
that threat may be minimal.

04:29.721 --> 04:31.689
Nina, that's your line.

04:32.123 --> 04:34.557
- Go ahead.
- Try to get everyone together on it.

04:34.659 --> 04:37.822
Nina Myers's line. It's Bauer.

04:38.730 --> 04:39.958
I got it.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.558
- What the hell's going on?
- George, listen up.

04:44.669 --> 04:46.364
That field that we were standing in...

04:46.471 --> 04:48.632
...is hiding
an underground detention facility.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.072
It's being used as a prison
to house Victor Drazen.

04:51.576 --> 04:54.136
What? You said you took
him out two years ago.

04:54.245 --> 04:57.510
Apparently not. I'm staring at him.
There's a team in place.

04:57.615 --> 05:00.140
They're ready to attack.
They've cut off the power.

05:00.251 --> 05:02.913
I need you to send in a field unit now.

05:04.288 --> 05:06.620
What are you going to do?

05:06.724 --> 05:09.693
- I'll call Division.
- Forget it. By the time you get approval...

05:09.794 --> 05:13.560
...this whole thing will be over.
If Drazen escapes, it'll be our fault.

05:13.664 --> 05:15.256
You know what this man can do.

05:17.869 --> 05:19.200
You decide.

05:21.506 --> 05:23.064
What's going on?

05:26.878 --> 05:28.072
Dispatch a field unit...

05:28.179 --> 05:30.147
...to the location in Saugus.

05:30.248 --> 05:33.274
I'll clear it from my end.
Get a hold of Chappelle immediately.

05:33.451 --> 05:36.352
George, what is going on?
Is Jack all right?

05:36.788 --> 05:39.086
It's a shame.
You're wasting the best years...

05:39.190 --> 05:42.182
...of your life on a married man.

05:42.293 --> 05:44.887
Picking up Almeida
on the rebound. What's that about?

05:44.996 --> 05:49.126
- That is out of line.
- You're out of line. Think about it.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.891
I'm just trying to be a friend here.

05:52.470 --> 05:53.630
George.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.996
- Just tell me if he..
- Nina!

05:56.207 --> 05:57.640
Where's Jack?

05:58.943 --> 06:01.138
Teri, thank God, you're okay.

06:01.746 --> 06:05.648
- Any word on Kim?
- No, not yet, but we're working on it.

06:06.150 --> 06:08.380
- I need to talk to Jack.
- You can't.

06:08.486 --> 06:10.078
He's on assignment.

06:10.188 --> 06:13.055
Has he been told
what happened at the safe house?

06:13.157 --> 06:14.784
- Not yet.
- Why not?

06:14.926 --> 06:18.225
- Because we can't get a hold of him.
- Get a hold of him now.

06:18.329 --> 06:22.322
- I'm sorry, it's just not possible.
- Nina, I want to talk to Jack.

06:22.433 --> 06:25.197
Jack's in a situation
where he needs our support.

06:25.303 --> 06:28.363
We're doing everything
we can to give it to him.

06:31.108 --> 06:34.771
- What kind of situation?
- That's all I can tell you right now.

06:34.879 --> 06:39.509
I need you to come to the conference room,
tell me what happened before Tony arrived.

06:39.617 --> 06:43.485
- I told Tony everything in the car.
- It won't hurt to go over it again.

06:43.588 --> 06:47.354
Any details you can give us will help us
and they will help Jack.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.353
All right, but I need to know
what's going on with my family.

06:53.798 --> 06:57.928
I know, and I promise I'll give you
an update as soon as I have one.

06:58.769 --> 06:59.997
All right?

07:03.474 --> 07:05.339
Stand against the door.

07:06.444 --> 07:09.709
Lawrence, what's going on out there?

07:10.181 --> 07:12.411
Lawrence, do you copy?

07:15.386 --> 07:17.581
Ray, this is DeSalvo. Come in.

07:18.623 --> 07:21.558
- Ray!
- We got to leave. Which way?

07:21.792 --> 07:23.987
The flood egress is to the right.

07:24.762 --> 07:26.525
Open the door slowly.

07:35.273 --> 07:37.764
Step out into the middle of the hall.

07:44.415 --> 07:46.144
Turn to your right.

07:46.450 --> 07:47.849
Keep moving.

08:07.038 --> 08:08.869
Lawrence, where are you?

08:08.973 --> 08:11.533
- Do you copy?
- We have to get out of here.

08:11.642 --> 08:13.303
We're too exposed.

08:14.011 --> 08:15.740
All right. What's the plan?

08:15.846 --> 08:18.713
How are they going to break you out
of here?

08:19.383 --> 08:21.578
You son of a bitch, if any of my men die...

08:21.686 --> 08:23.950
What area of this building
is most defendable?

08:33.030 --> 08:34.554
Let's get out of here, move.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.895
Fall back. Defender retreat!

08:38.235 --> 08:39.600
Turn around.

08:57.922 --> 09:00.755
I've been trying to get a hold of Chappelle
for 10 minutes.

09:00.858 --> 09:03.260
Whatever he's doing this is more important,
trust me.

09:03.327 --> 09:05.295
- Important? How?
- For starters...

09:05.796 --> 09:08.788
...I sent a CTU field unit to
a D.O.D. facility.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.663
- I need some unity of command.
- All I can do is give him the message.

09:12.770 --> 09:16.137
- Get him to call me soon.
- I'll work on it.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.502
Mrs. Bauer.

09:18.075 --> 09:19.167
Teri.

09:19.276 --> 09:21.437
George Mason.
I thought you were being debriefed.

09:21.545 --> 09:23.570
You're busy,
but Nina won't tell me anything.

09:23.681 --> 09:25.706
I need to know what's going on with Kim.

09:25.850 --> 09:29.377
I don't know any more than Nina,
but I'm sure Kim's safe.

09:30.454 --> 09:33.252
I wish I could believe that,
but based on what?

09:33.357 --> 09:35.518
I'm not fully informed,
but according to Tony...

09:35.626 --> 09:38.754
...the man that attacked you
asked where she was, right?

09:38.863 --> 09:39.887
Yes.

09:40.197 --> 09:41.960
That means they're looking for her, too.

09:42.066 --> 09:44.899
As time passes,
it gets harder for them, easier for us.

09:45.036 --> 09:46.401
There's only a few of them...

09:46.504 --> 09:50.031
...whereas we can cover the whole city
and believe me, we are.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.744
I want you to know
Jack is extremely important to us here.

09:55.846 --> 09:59.976
Nobody's going to rest easy
until your daughter's back, safe and sound.

10:00.551 --> 10:01.848
Thank you.

10:03.688 --> 10:05.315
Just doing my job.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.885
- Mason.
- George, it's Nina.

10:14.065 --> 10:16.397
Our unit will be
on-site in about 15 minutes.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.627
They want to know who's in command,
us or D.O.D.?

10:18.736 --> 10:20.829
We are. Let me know
as soon as they're on-site.

10:20.938 --> 10:22.235
All right.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.069
Was that about Jack?

10:25.376 --> 10:26.968
We've got a lot going on right now.

10:27.078 --> 10:29.273
Soon as we get word from Jack,
we'll let you know.

10:29.714 --> 10:31.147
You've been very kind.

10:31.248 --> 10:32.943
My assistant will look after you.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.245
You let her know
if you need anything, okay?

10:36.420 --> 10:38.820
Do me a favor. Keep your chin up.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.957
- Rebecca.
- Yes, George?

10:47.064 --> 10:49.532
I'm sending Jack's wife down.
Babysit her for me.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.601
Sure, but what do I do with her?

10:51.702 --> 10:55.570
I don't care what you do with her,
just keep her out of my face.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.134
Got it.

11:01.545 --> 11:03.012
Where's Patty?

11:03.147 --> 11:05.479
She's finishing up the speech.

11:05.716 --> 11:07.980
Hold that for me? Be right back.

11:10.488 --> 11:11.978
- Senator...
- Congratulations.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.080
Looks like you're moving
to the White House.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.716
You know what?
We'll know by the end of the day.

11:16.827 --> 11:17.816
Congratulations.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.290
- We missed you out there.
- Hi.

11:20.631 --> 11:24.465
I'm just going through it
one last time.

11:29.974 --> 11:32.340
I made the changes you asked for.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.248
Yeah, that's much better.

11:40.251 --> 11:42.014
I'm glad you like it.

11:47.191 --> 11:49.955
I can't believe you won all 11 primaries.

11:50.594 --> 11:53.188
You and your family must be so happy.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.232
Yeah, we are.

11:57.935 --> 12:01.666
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just all catching up with me.

12:02.206 --> 12:03.969
It's been a long day.

12:08.579 --> 12:10.342
You know what, Patty?

12:10.948 --> 12:13.644
Why don't we move
the second paragraph to the end?

12:13.751 --> 12:16.481
I'll close with the note about party unity.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.449
That's a good idea.

12:21.859 --> 12:23.087
Senator?

12:23.627 --> 12:24.958
Yes, Patty.

12:25.462 --> 12:29.125
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you, but...

12:30.134 --> 12:33.399
...every time I start
it just seems inappropriate.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.335
What is it?

12:35.472 --> 12:37.531
It's just that...

12:39.476 --> 12:42.536
...I wanted to tell you
how much I admire you.

12:45.683 --> 12:48.982
I don't see very many people
who stand by their principles...

12:49.086 --> 12:52.055
...the way that you do,
and I truly believe...

12:52.156 --> 12:55.216
...our country would be a better place
with you leading it.

13:03.567 --> 13:06.866
- What is it?
- Nothing. I'm just a little flustered.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.373
What a wonderful
and unexpected compliment.

13:16.447 --> 13:19.507
I'll just switch those paragraphs.

13:21.518 --> 13:22.644
All right.

13:35.099 --> 13:37.590
This is Mason. What's your 20?

13:37.701 --> 13:39.794
We're approaching the site!

13:40.004 --> 13:42.063
What's going on down there?

13:44.608 --> 13:47.099
Looks like the door
has been blown in!

13:47.211 --> 13:49.805
- Are the hostiles inside?
- They must be.

13:49.914 --> 13:53.179
There's no activity here.
We're preparing to go in.

14:13.871 --> 14:15.202
Take cover!

14:16.106 --> 14:17.698
- Father!
- Andre!

14:17.808 --> 14:19.901
- Get down or I'll shoot him!
- Let him go.

14:20.144 --> 14:21.736
Let my father go!

14:22.046 --> 14:23.673
Drop your weapons!

14:24.315 --> 14:26.647
Stay back or I will shoot him!

14:27.251 --> 14:30.311
- Drop it or he's dead!
- Drop it now, you're surrounded!

14:30.421 --> 14:33.413
Back off!
Drop your weapons or I will shoot!

14:33.857 --> 14:36.485
Let my father go right now
or this man dies.

14:36.593 --> 14:38.458
- Drop your weapons!
- I'll kill him.

14:38.562 --> 14:40.587
- Don't do it!
- Back off!

14:40.698 --> 14:43.861
- Don't release that prisoner.
- Drop them or I'll shoot him!

14:43.968 --> 14:45.765
Don't do it, Bauer!

14:45.869 --> 14:48.201
- Drop it!
- I'll give you three seconds.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.329
One...

14:49.440 --> 14:50.464
...two...

14:51.241 --> 14:53.175
My weapon's up.

14:58.115 --> 14:59.104
No!

14:59.650 --> 15:01.811
- Father.
- Andre.

15:05.689 --> 15:09.216
- Where is Alexis?
- He's been out of touch for a while.

15:09.727 --> 15:11.854
We have to assume the worst.

15:20.871 --> 15:22.930
Hostiles outside the main entrance.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.941
- How many?
- At least a dozen, all well-armed.

15:26.377 --> 15:28.743
Collapse the corridor immediately.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.041
- Let's hustle, men.
- Down here.

15:31.648 --> 15:34.446
Take him.
We may need him as a bargaining chip.

15:53.237 --> 15:54.568
Go!

16:05.482 --> 16:08.076
That was a mistake.
Now you're trapped.

16:08.185 --> 16:09.550
We will see.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.853
I told you, don't mess with me.

16:14.958 --> 16:18.894
You got something that belongs to me,
better give it right now.

16:18.996 --> 16:21.897
- I ain't got nothing.
- We cool. It's all good.

16:21.999 --> 16:24.263
We cool if you and your girls back off.

16:25.803 --> 16:27.236
Get her feet!

16:34.578 --> 16:37.146
You holding out on me?
You're a bad girl.

16:51.328 --> 16:54.354
When we get out of here
maybe I'll mess you up just like that.

16:54.465 --> 16:56.524
- What is your problem?
- You.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.600
Me? The only reason I'm here
is because you told the cops...

16:59.703 --> 17:00.965
...I was a part of the deal.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.698
You were a part of the deal.

17:02.806 --> 17:04.967
I didn't even know it was happening.

17:05.075 --> 17:07.236
Nobody told you to come over.

17:07.578 --> 17:11.570
- If this is about Rick...
- You think I care about that loser?

17:11.682 --> 17:13.650
- He's not a loser.
- He kidnaps you...

17:13.750 --> 17:16.048
...almost gets you killed,
and you defend him?

17:16.153 --> 17:19.088
- He didn't know what was going on.
- Like I said, he's a loser.

17:20.757 --> 17:24.659
What are you shaking your head for?
You're daddy's little girl.

17:24.928 --> 17:27.521
- You get everything handed to you.
- Shut up!

17:27.631 --> 17:31.658
I have been listening to this crap all day
about how I get everything I want...

17:31.768 --> 17:34.202
...how my life is great
and everyone else's sucks.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.467
You want to know something?
You don't know anything about me.

17:37.574 --> 17:40.407
Last night I was kidnapped,
tied up in the back of a trunk...

17:40.511 --> 17:43.344
...and then I got to see your
friend Dan get shot in the head.

17:43.447 --> 17:46.541
Take all the bad luck you've had,
it wouldn't fit into half...

17:46.650 --> 17:48.618
...of what's happened to me
in the past 24 hours.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.415
So messing me up may not be
as easy as you think...

17:51.522 --> 17:54.218
...but if you want to try, bring it on.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.157
Here, outside, any place you like.

18:40.637 --> 18:42.696
You think I am a monster...

18:43.040 --> 18:44.507
...because I want revenge...

18:44.608 --> 18:47.634
...on your wife and daughter
as well as on you.

18:47.911 --> 18:51.108
You were a monster
long before you ever heard of me.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.908
I see.

18:53.016 --> 18:55.280
You consider yourself informed.

18:55.953 --> 18:57.887
You have read magazines.

18:58.589 --> 19:00.989
You've studied intelligence reports...

19:01.091 --> 19:05.619
...filed by people who tell their superiors
only what they want to hear.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.896
And you have the audacity to judge me?

19:10.300 --> 19:12.928
So when does your suffering end, Victor?

19:13.036 --> 19:15.095
After you've killed me
and Senator Palmer...

19:15.205 --> 19:18.038
...and all the thousands
of other enemies you have?

19:18.141 --> 19:19.165
Yes.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.737
Simple, is it not?

19:23.780 --> 19:25.247
You're insane.

19:25.349 --> 19:27.317
It's a psychotic fantasy.

19:34.458 --> 19:39.327
A fantasy which is coming closer
and closer to a reality.

19:44.635 --> 19:47.536
This is Victor Drazen.
Whom am I speaking to?

19:48.105 --> 19:49.231
This is George Mason.

19:49.339 --> 19:52.001
The district director
of the Counter Terrorist Unit in LA.

19:52.109 --> 19:55.237
You will be the person
I will be negotiating with?

19:55.345 --> 19:58.940
Negative.
We do not negotiate with terrorists.

19:59.216 --> 20:01.207
I'm willing to listen to your concerns.

20:01.318 --> 20:04.776
My main concern is Jack Bauer.

20:05.255 --> 20:07.485
- Do you know him?
- Yes, I know him.

20:07.591 --> 20:10.059
Do you want to see him alive again?

20:11.228 --> 20:13.196
How do I know he's alive?

20:18.168 --> 20:20.261
- George?
- Yeah, it's me.

20:20.370 --> 20:23.567
I've counted six of them,
heavily armed with assault rifles...

20:23.674 --> 20:25.699
As you hear, he is alive.

20:25.909 --> 20:29.640
I'll be speaking with my superiors
and I'll get back to you.

20:32.449 --> 20:35.850
Drazen's taken over command
of the facility. He's got Jack.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.114
There's at least six,
they've got assault weapons, explosives.

20:39.222 --> 20:42.248
Get that information to the field unit.

20:44.261 --> 20:46.786
Bring up the layout of the facility.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.967
- How did Jack sound?
- Alive.

20:52.302 --> 20:54.202
It'll be a long, drawn-out process.

20:54.304 --> 20:55.862
I know the drill.

20:56.239 --> 20:57.900
You know it may not turn out well.

20:58.709 --> 21:03.043
If you want me to put somebody else that's
less emotionally involved on this, I will.

21:03.146 --> 21:05.080
I can do my job, George.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.574
Okay.

21:12.956 --> 21:15.754
- Any word from Chappelle?
- I still can't get a hold of him.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.292
Unbelievable.

21:17.394 --> 21:21.421
I hope that bastard doesn't plan
on blaming me if things go wrong.

21:48.425 --> 21:50.052
- Take it.
- No way.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.889
- I said take it!
- No.

21:56.199 --> 21:59.691
- Who's smoking pot?
- That one over there.

21:59.803 --> 22:02.897
- No. She threw it at me.
- Bitch, why you lying?

22:03.140 --> 22:04.607
Give it to me.

22:05.342 --> 22:06.809
Give it to me!

22:13.617 --> 22:16.347
- And who are you?
- I swear, it wasn't me.

22:19.489 --> 22:21.013
You're coming with me.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.094
She's telling the truth.

22:26.963 --> 22:30.763
- Don't make a liar out of me, blondie.
- No need, you are one.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.331
Stop it!

22:40.610 --> 22:43.374
- Stop it now!
- Wait, I didn't do nothing!

22:43.480 --> 22:46.449
Get off of me! I didn't do nothing!

22:50.353 --> 22:53.618
I'm going to get you back, blondie,
don't you worry!

22:56.560 --> 22:57.788
Officer.

22:59.329 --> 23:00.387
Wait.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.028
I want to talk to the cop
that busted me today.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.103
I think his name is Krugman.

23:07.204 --> 23:10.799
- You want to talk to him about what?
- What happened today.

23:11.308 --> 23:15.074
He wants to know about it,
so tell him I'm ready to talk.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.174
Come on.

23:33.196 --> 23:35.494
Two years ago in Kosovo...

23:36.032 --> 23:38.967
...the man that went into the building
before the explosion...

23:39.069 --> 23:41.003
...obviously wasn't you.

23:41.705 --> 23:44.833
- You were using a double.
- A common technique.

23:44.941 --> 23:48.342
I am surprised your people
were fooled by it.

23:49.246 --> 23:51.180
That's not my point, Victor.

23:51.281 --> 23:53.249
What is your point, Jack?

23:53.350 --> 23:55.318
You were using a double.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.313
It means you thought you were a target.

23:59.256 --> 24:02.487
You let that man get near your family,
you put your family in danger.

24:02.592 --> 24:05.083
You're responsible for their deaths.

24:05.595 --> 24:07.563
They were away on a trip.

24:08.298 --> 24:10.061
My daughter was ill.

24:11.835 --> 24:15.066
They returned one day earlier
than expected.

24:17.140 --> 24:18.368
But yes...

24:19.609 --> 24:22.077
...I should have been more careful.

24:29.286 --> 24:31.720
Father, are you all right?

24:38.228 --> 24:40.253
Over the last two years...

24:41.831 --> 24:46.268
...I have accepted my share of
responsibility for the death of my family.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.531
This is the day...

24:51.241 --> 24:52.833
...you accept...

24:53.443 --> 24:54.910
...your share.

24:58.882 --> 25:00.247
Come, Dad.

25:03.587 --> 25:06.181
Make sure he does not die.

25:30.847 --> 25:31.836
Come.

25:38.888 --> 25:40.856
Is this what you wanted?

25:47.130 --> 25:48.188
Much better.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.228
- Senator?
- Yeah, Elaine?

25:50.333 --> 25:52.665
Mike says they're ready
for you downstairs anytime.

25:52.769 --> 25:54.999
Okay. Tell them I'll be down in 20 minutes.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.298
You have a copy
for the teleprompter?

25:57.407 --> 25:59.341
It's this one...

25:59.676 --> 26:01.075
All but the last page.

26:03.246 --> 26:04.736
Okay, thanks.

26:05.115 --> 26:07.413
Would you like to be left alone?

26:08.151 --> 26:10.745
No. You can work in here if you want.

26:40.650 --> 26:41.947
I'm sorry.

26:42.585 --> 26:43.916
What is it?

26:45.321 --> 26:49.189
It's just that I feel bad that
this day's been tainted for you.

26:50.393 --> 26:52.224
Don't feel bad for me.

26:53.363 --> 26:55.763
It's Keith and Nicole
who've been suffering.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.732
Excuse me for saying this, Senator,
but you do that too much.

26:58.835 --> 27:01.633
- Do what?
- You worry about everybody else.

27:02.405 --> 27:04.896
You take care of everybody else.
Who takes care of you?

27:05.008 --> 27:06.942
You all take care of me.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.578
We all want to, but...

27:12.148 --> 27:14.708
...planning schedules
and writing speeches...

27:14.818 --> 27:17.116
...isn't taking care of someone.

27:18.588 --> 27:20.146
I'm fine, Patty.

27:34.637 --> 27:35.968
Just relax.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.209
You need this.

27:42.946 --> 27:46.109
That does feel good.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.299
I appreciate it.

28:07.837 --> 28:09.202
I really do.

28:10.940 --> 28:14.603
But if I get too comfortable,
I may not get off this couch.

28:18.448 --> 28:22.680
I'll just go prepare tomorrow's
briefing with Mike. Excuse me.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.493
- CTU, Myers.
- Chappelle calling for Mason.

28:41.604 --> 28:43.595
Yes, I'll put you through.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.208
- Mason.
- It's Chappelle.

28:51.214 --> 28:54.012
I've been trying
to reach you for the past half hour.

28:54.117 --> 28:57.518
While I've been getting reamed
by D.O.D. and the Pentagon.

28:57.620 --> 29:00.589
I think I've managed to untangle
the mess you've made.

29:00.690 --> 29:03.386
The mess I've made?
What are you talking about?

29:03.493 --> 29:07.156
You should've kept Bauer on a tighter leash.
A lot tighter.

29:07.730 --> 29:10.130
I'm not in love with the guy either,
but he delivers.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.427
Really?

29:11.968 --> 29:13.492
Come on, let's face it.

29:13.603 --> 29:15.901
If it wasn't for Jack,
Victor would've escaped.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.803
It would've been embarrassing
for high-ranking individuals...

29:18.908 --> 29:21.536
- ... if I'm not mistaken.
- You're very mistaken.

29:21.644 --> 29:25.375
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on, think it through.

29:25.715 --> 29:28.582
Drazen wasn't officially a prisoner, right?

29:28.718 --> 29:32.381
So he couldn't officially escape.
It wouldn't have embarrassed anyone.

29:32.488 --> 29:34.718
- It would've been...
- A nonevent.

29:34.824 --> 29:38.351
Exactly. Instead,
we've got an assault team out there...

29:38.461 --> 29:42.022
...with all kinds of people in the loop.
The cops will get wind of it...

29:42.131 --> 29:44.361
...and then, God forbid, the press.

29:44.467 --> 29:46.992
You want to talk about embarrassing?

29:49.005 --> 29:50.563
Now we have to end this thing.

29:50.673 --> 29:53.642
And I'm not talking hours,
I'm talking minutes.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.037
What about Bauer?

30:00.183 --> 30:02.981
Nobody asked him to go out there tonight.

30:03.152 --> 30:07.088
Get on with it,
or I'll find someone who will.

30:18.868 --> 30:21.029
I'm going to have
to order a full assault.

30:21.137 --> 30:23.401
Starting in about five minutes.

30:24.007 --> 30:26.669
Team's making their final preparations.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.540
I'm sorry.

30:40.456 --> 30:42.890
Teri, it's Tony. Can you pick up?

30:43.526 --> 30:45.858
- Hello?
- Look, we found Kim.

30:45.962 --> 30:49.159
She's fine. She's at a local precinct.
They're bringing her over.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.392
Are you sure she's okay?
Can I talk to her?

30:51.501 --> 30:53.662
Not now, we'll put you through
as soon as we can.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.637
Okay. Patch her through
as soon as she calls.

30:56.739 --> 30:58.570
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

30:58.675 --> 31:00.700
- They found Kim.
- They did?

31:00.843 --> 31:02.902
- Yeah.
- That's great.

31:04.247 --> 31:05.805
I'm so relieved.

31:13.456 --> 31:16.254
Teri, I have some information about Jack.

31:18.628 --> 31:20.493
Why don't you sit down?

31:24.467 --> 31:29.302
He may have been captured by the same
group that was after you and Kim.

31:32.075 --> 31:33.406
Oh, my God.

31:35.244 --> 31:38.771
I know that sounds bad,
but we have rescue teams on the site...

31:38.881 --> 31:42.840
...and the people who have Jack
have been completely surrounded.

31:50.727 --> 31:51.887
Teri...

31:53.496 --> 31:54.986
...I know Jack.

31:56.666 --> 31:59.260
I know he will get out of this.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.173
I knew you'd want to be told.

32:47.383 --> 32:50.250
Charges have been placed.
We are good to go.

32:55.591 --> 32:57.559
- Yeah?
- This is it.

33:02.799 --> 33:05.427
- All right.
- What about Bauer?

33:09.405 --> 33:11.430
Just make sure you get Drazen.

33:12.642 --> 33:13.631
Go.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.403
Hit it.

33:20.716 --> 33:21.705
Go!

33:46.876 --> 33:48.207
Kimberly.

33:48.578 --> 33:49.909
What is it?

33:50.613 --> 33:52.808
- We're releasing you.
- Did you speak to my dad?

33:52.915 --> 33:55.850
No, but I talked to the people
he works with.

34:00.823 --> 34:04.725
Melanie told me she lied.
She admitted you had nothing to do...

34:04.827 --> 34:07.318
...with the drug deal.
I called the number you gave me.

34:07.430 --> 34:10.728
Everything checked out.
Sounds like you had a pretty tough day.

34:10.833 --> 34:14.234
- Yeah. Did you speak to my mom?
- She's waiting for you at CTU.

34:14.337 --> 34:15.895
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

34:16.005 --> 34:18.030
I'll drive you there myself.

34:22.311 --> 34:24.245
- Ready?
- I think so.

34:25.248 --> 34:28.045
- Would you do me a favor, David?
- What's that, Mike?

34:28.150 --> 34:29.277
Smile.

34:30.686 --> 34:33.210
Not a politician's smile, a real one.

34:33.922 --> 34:35.891
You've been through hell today...

34:35.992 --> 34:37.652
...but you've come through it.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.661
And tomorrow morning
the fight starts again.

34:41.197 --> 34:43.630
But tonight you need to celebrate.

34:44.467 --> 34:46.161
I'll be fine, Mike.

34:47.136 --> 34:49.603
Let go of it, just for a little bit.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.373
I can't.

34:53.409 --> 34:56.105
This thing with Keith is just beginning.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.443
As for Sherry and me,
you've had a front-row seat today.

34:59.549 --> 35:01.414
You know it's not good.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.984
Let me explain something to you.

35:06.656 --> 35:11.593
Once you're in the White House,
everything defers to the office.

35:11.794 --> 35:15.230
It's what you need to do the job.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.527
If it's your marriage that helps you,
that's great.

35:22.271 --> 35:23.863
But if not...

35:24.740 --> 35:26.503
...that's okay, too.

35:29.979 --> 35:32.573
You can have whatever you want.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.114
All right, Mike.

35:42.758 --> 35:43.986
Let's go.

36:02.044 --> 36:03.204
Report.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.547
One dead body.

36:06.182 --> 36:08.878
No hostiles. Sector One secure.

36:19.729 --> 36:21.356
Sector Two secure.

36:21.897 --> 36:25.833
One dead body. Appears to be Warden
DeSalvo. No hostiles.

36:27.136 --> 36:29.969
Drake, this is Mason.
What's going on down there?

36:30.206 --> 36:33.937
The entire staff, including the
warden, is dead. Drazen's gone...

36:34.243 --> 36:36.837
...and so is anyone else who was here.

36:45.354 --> 36:47.515
They broke through one of the walls.

36:47.623 --> 36:50.615
Some sort of tunnel.
Maybe an old sewer system.

36:50.726 --> 36:51.750
Follow them.

37:01.103 --> 37:02.229
Drake?

37:05.941 --> 37:07.374
It's booby-trapped.

37:07.476 --> 37:08.841
Laser mines.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.704
- Can you disarm?
- Given time.

37:11.947 --> 37:13.175
How much?

37:16.752 --> 37:17.844
About a half-hour.

37:20.222 --> 37:21.780
Do what you can.

37:28.631 --> 37:31.031
Get your hands up on your head.

37:35.071 --> 37:36.368
Well done.

37:41.744 --> 37:44.304
We have less than three hours left.
Get down.

37:45.481 --> 37:47.642
Wait!

37:47.983 --> 37:50.679
I will offer you one consolation.

37:52.822 --> 37:56.121
Your family will be joining you soon.

37:56.225 --> 37:58.591
Your son Alexis,
do you want to see him again?

38:00.229 --> 38:02.959
- Alexis is dead.
- No, he's not. We've got him.

38:03.065 --> 38:04.726
You are lying.

38:05.434 --> 38:07.868
How else would I know
that he was to have a meeting...

38:07.970 --> 38:11.269
...with one of Senator Palmer's staff?
A woman named Elizabeth Nash.

38:11.374 --> 38:14.138
In Room 1243 at 4:30 this afternoon.

38:15.177 --> 38:19.546
- That much is true.
- We captured him. I know where he is.

38:32.027 --> 38:33.460
Get him in!

38:56.619 --> 38:58.917
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

39:11.834 --> 39:14.064
- Hello?
- Mom, it's me.

39:14.470 --> 39:16.461
- Hi, honey.
- I can't wait to see you.

39:16.572 --> 39:19.632
I can't wait to see you.
I'm so glad you're okay. I thought...

39:19.742 --> 39:22.336
I know. I thought they had you again.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.670
How did you end up in jail?

39:24.780 --> 39:27.681
I'll tell you everything when I get there.
Where's Dad?

39:28.584 --> 39:31.451
He's not here. He's working.

39:31.554 --> 39:34.045
I'm hoping he'll call in very soon.

39:35.090 --> 39:37.024
I love you so much, Mom.

39:37.326 --> 39:40.454
I'm going to be there
in a few minutes.

39:40.863 --> 39:42.728
I love you, too, honey.

39:43.466 --> 39:44.524
Bye.

39:45.234 --> 39:46.258
Bye.

39:53.576 --> 39:54.907
Thanks.

40:05.588 --> 40:08.989
- I'm sorry about not believing you at first.
- Don't worry about it.

40:09.091 --> 40:12.151
I'm not sure if I believe it myself.
Watch out!

40:25.841 --> 40:26.967
No!

40:27.977 --> 40:29.069
Get off of me!

40:31.847 --> 40:33.405
No! Get off me!

40:35.584 --> 40:36.573
No!
