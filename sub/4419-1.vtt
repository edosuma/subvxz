( male )
SINCE THE LAST "SOUTH PARK",
YOU'VE WAITED FOUR LONG WEEKS

00:08.112 --> 00:11.747
TO FIND OUT WHO THE FATHER
OF ERIC CARTMAN IS.

00:11.749 --> 00:14.950
NOW FINALLY, THE SHOCKING
TRUTH ABOUT CARTMAN'S LINEAGE

00:14.952 --> 00:18.620
WILL NOT BE SEEN TONIGHT
SO THAT WE CAN BRING YOU

00:18.622 --> 00:21.857
THE FOLLOWING
SPECIAL PRESENTATION.

00:22.026 --> 00:25.027
NOW GET READY FOR CANADA'S
HOTTEST ACTION STARS,

00:25.029 --> 00:28.764
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP
IN THE...

00:37.374 --> 00:38.974
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:38.976 --> 00:41.376
BEFORE YOU TODAY
SITS A MURDERER.

00:41.378 --> 00:42.411
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION,

00:42.413 --> 00:44.746
THIS MONSTER ENTERED
THE HOME OF DR. JEFFREY O'DWYER

00:44.748 --> 00:47.349
AND STRUCK HIM REPEATEDLY
IN THE HEAD WITH THIS HAMMER.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.718
THAT MONSTER IS SITTING
RIGHT OVER THERE

00:49.720 --> 00:52.788
AND HIS NAME
IS TERRANCE!

00:53.524 --> 00:54.356
( farting )

00:54.358 --> 00:55.991
TERRANCE,
YOU FARTED IN COURT.

00:55.993 --> 00:58.060
YES, PHILLIP, I'M MAKING
A CASE FOR OUR DEFENSE.

00:58.062 --> 01:01.363
ALL OF THESE THINGS
LINK TERRANCE TO THE MURDER.

01:01.365 --> 01:04.166
HAIR FIBERS, BLOOD SAMPLES,
NAIL CLIPPINGS,

01:04.168 --> 01:06.001
A PIECE OF HIS SHIRT,

01:06.003 --> 01:07.769
A WATCH WITH HIS
INITIALS ON IT.

01:07.771 --> 01:09.104
A DAY PLANNER WITH
THE MURDER SCHEDULED.

01:09.106 --> 01:12.541
A HAIKU CALLED "TIME TO KILL
DR. JEFFREY O'DWYER".

01:12.543 --> 01:16.144
"DR. O'DWYER, TIME TO
HAVE YOUR HEAD SMASHED IN

01:16.146 --> 01:17.646
WITH MY NEW HAMMER."

01:17.648 --> 01:20.582
TERRANCE, YOU MAY BE
A FAMOUS SURGEON,

01:20.584 --> 01:22.851
BUT YOU'RE
NOT GOD!

01:22.853 --> 01:23.819
TERRANCE.

01:23.821 --> 01:26.421
WOULD YOU LIKE
A "MONKEY CLAW", PHILLIP?

01:26.423 --> 01:27.255
YES, PLEASE.

01:27.257 --> 01:28.256
( farting )

01:28.258 --> 01:28.957
( laughing )

01:28.959 --> 01:30.092
THAT'S CALLED
THE "MONKEY CLAW"

01:30.094 --> 01:32.227
BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE MY COLON
IS BEING RIPPED APART

01:32.229 --> 01:33.895
BY A THOUSAND MONKEYS.

01:33.897 --> 01:35.664
THE "MONKEY CLAW"
IS SMELLY.

01:35.666 --> 01:36.965
COME ON,
GET A MOVE ON.

01:36.967 --> 01:38.800
I AIN'T GETTING
ANY YOUNGER UP HERE.

01:38.802 --> 01:40.202
MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY,
YOUR HONOR.

01:40.204 --> 01:43.038
I SEE FROM YOUR ACCENT
THAT YOU'RE SOUTHERN CANADIAN.

01:43.040 --> 01:43.872
THAT IS CORRECT.

01:43.874 --> 01:45.974
GOOD PEOPLE OF THE JURY,
MY CLIENT, TERRANCE,

01:45.976 --> 01:47.542
IS AN
INNOCENT MAN.

01:47.544 --> 01:48.343
( farting )

01:48.345 --> 01:51.246
YOU FARTED DURING
THE CLOSING ARGUMENT!

01:51.248 --> 01:53.115
I HAVE, HAVEN'T I,
TERRANCE?

01:53.117 --> 01:53.815
( farting )

01:53.817 --> 01:54.950
( laughing )

01:54.952 --> 01:55.717
YOUR HONOR,

01:55.719 --> 01:57.719
THE DEFENSE IS TRYING TO MAKE
A MOCKERY OF THIS COURT.

01:57.721 --> 02:00.622
THEY THINK THAT FARTS ARE FUNNY,
BUT THEY'RE NOT!

02:00.624 --> 02:01.390
SUSTAINED.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.558
GOOD PEOPLE OF THE JURY,
MY CLIENT

02:03.560 --> 02:05.360
IS NO MORE A MURDERER
THAN YOU OR ME.

02:05.362 --> 02:07.396
HE LOVES PUPPIES
AND HATES MEAN THINGS.

02:07.398 --> 02:11.266
WOULD A MURDERER GO TO THE ZOO
AND FEED ANIMALS LIKE THIS?

02:11.268 --> 02:12.334
OF COURSE NOT.

02:12.336 --> 02:15.036
SO IN SUMMATION,
FIND TERRANCE INNOCENT,

02:15.038 --> 02:17.072
OR ELSE
HE'LL KILL YOU.

02:17.074 --> 02:18.340
( gasping )

02:18.342 --> 02:19.474
( laughing )

02:19.476 --> 02:20.642
JUST KIDDING.

02:20.644 --> 02:22.244
THE DEFENSE
RESTS.

02:22.246 --> 02:22.944
( farting )

02:22.946 --> 02:25.046
GODDAMNIT,
THAT ISN'T FUNNY.

02:25.048 --> 02:27.382
MADAME FORE-PERSON,
HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT

02:27.384 --> 02:28.917
SO WE CAN GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

02:28.919 --> 02:30.886
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.
WE HAVE FOUND TERRANCE

02:30.888 --> 02:33.088
IN THE ABOVE ENTITLED
ACTION OF MURDER

02:33.090 --> 02:34.823
AGAINST
DR. JEFFREY O'DWYER--

02:34.825 --> 02:35.624
( farting )

02:35.626 --> 02:37.492
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
REPEAT THAT

02:37.494 --> 02:38.527
BECAUSE WE HAD SOME
FLATULENCE ISSUES.

02:38.529 --> 02:39.928
I SAID, WE FIND--

02:39.930 --> 02:40.862
( farting )

02:40.864 --> 02:42.431
WE FIND TERRANCE--

02:42.433 --> 02:44.099
NOT GUILTY!

02:44.101 --> 02:45.901
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
TERRANCE?

02:45.903 --> 02:46.835
YOU'RE NOT GUILTY!

02:46.837 --> 02:50.038
YOU SAVED ME
FROM THE GAS CHAMBER!

02:50.040 --> 02:52.007
( laughing )

02:52.009 --> 02:53.308
OH, NO!

02:53.310 --> 02:55.377
THAT SURE
WAS FUN, PHILLIP.

02:55.379 --> 02:57.913
LET'S GO HOME
AND EAT<i> KROFF</i> DINNER.

02:57.915 --> 02:58.647
HERE, HERE.

02:58.649 --> 03:00.615
LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT,

03:00.617 --> 03:01.917
TERRANCE
AND PHILLIP.

03:01.919 --> 03:02.684
OH, HELLO,
SCOTT.

03:02.686 --> 03:03.985
NO HARD FEELINGS,
RIGHT OLD PAL?

03:03.987 --> 03:06.087
THERE ARE HARD FEELINGS,
THIS ISN'T OVER!

03:06.089 --> 03:07.189
I'M GONNA
SEE TO IT

03:07.191 --> 03:08.924
THAT YOU BOTH PAY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

03:08.926 --> 03:10.058
AND DO YOU
KNOW WHY?

03:10.060 --> 03:11.593
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A DICK?

03:11.595 --> 03:12.961
NO, BECAUSE
I HATE YOU.

03:12.963 --> 03:15.564
YOU THINK FARTING IS SO FUNNY,
WELL IT ISN'T!

03:15.566 --> 03:17.999
FART JOKES ARE
THE LOWEST FORM OF COMEDY,

03:18.001 --> 03:18.934
AND IF I--

03:18.936 --> 03:19.768
( farting )

03:19.770 --> 03:20.936
OH, I HATE
YOU BOTH!

03:20.938 --> 03:22.737
I'VE HATED YOU EVER SINCE
I CAN REMEMBER.

03:22.739 --> 03:25.474
I HATE YOU AND I WISH
YOU BOTH HAD CANCER!

03:25.476 --> 03:26.942
CANCER?

03:26.944 --> 03:28.677
YES, IN THE HEAD.

03:28.679 --> 03:29.511
HEAD CANCER?

03:29.513 --> 03:31.813
THIS IS NOT THE END,
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP.

03:31.815 --> 03:33.682
YOU'LL RUE
THIS DAY.

03:33.684 --> 03:35.484
SCOTT REALLY
HATES US, PHILLIP.

03:35.486 --> 03:37.385
YES, PERHAPS
HE'S HOMOPHOBIC.

03:37.387 --> 03:40.822
BUT WE'RE
NOT GAY, PHILLIP.

03:40.824 --> 03:41.556
WE'RE NOT?

03:41.558 --> 03:43.758
WELL, LET US BOARD THE SUBWAY
AND RETURN HOME.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.961
THERE WE CAN EAT
<i>KROFF</i> DINNER.

03:45.963 --> 03:47.095
YES, IT'S BEEN
A LONG DAY

03:47.097 --> 03:49.865
AND ONLY<i> KROFF</i> DINNER
CAN CALM MY NERVES.

03:53.136 --> 03:54.002
( farting )

03:54.004 --> 03:55.170
( laughing )

03:55.172 --> 03:56.238
SAY PHILLIP,

03:56.240 --> 03:58.540
WHY DOES SCOTT ALWAYS TRY
TO CONVICT ME OF MURDER?

03:58.542 --> 03:59.841
HE DOES IT
EVERY WEEK.

03:59.843 --> 04:01.343
HE SURE DOES
SEEM TO HATE US.

04:01.345 --> 04:03.512
I WONDER WHAT
HE'LL TRY TO DO NEXT.

04:03.514 --> 04:04.379
GOD ONLY KNOWS.

04:04.381 --> 04:06.214
THE SUBWAY CERTAINLY
IS WONDERFUL, TERRANCE.

04:06.216 --> 04:08.717
IT SURE IS, LET'S LOOK
FOR TREASURE.

04:08.719 --> 04:11.186
YES, LET'S LOOK
FOR TREASURE.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.293
( phone ringing )

04:18.295 --> 04:19.160
HELLO?

04:19.162 --> 04:21.296
( male )
Is this Scott
from Canada?

04:21.298 --> 04:22.163
YES, YES, IT IS.

04:22.165 --> 04:23.498
You're a journalist,
right?

04:23.500 --> 04:25.634
YES, I'M A TELEVISION CRITIC
FOR MAGAZINES.

04:25.636 --> 04:28.303
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HATE
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP.

04:28.305 --> 04:29.137
YES, YES, I DO.

04:29.139 --> 04:31.773
THEY THINK FART JOKES ARE
A SOPHISTICATED FORM OF COMEDY,

04:31.775 --> 04:32.641
BUT THEY'RE NOT.

04:32.643 --> 04:34.242
WHAT IF I WERE TO HELP YOU
GET RID OF THEM

04:34.244 --> 04:35.777
ONCE AND FOR ALL?

04:35.779 --> 04:36.778
WHO IS THIS?

04:36.780 --> 04:38.713
I'M SOMEONE
WHO CAN HELP YOU

04:38.715 --> 04:39.814
IF YOU HELP ME.

04:39.816 --> 04:42.384
JUST CALL ME YOUR OLD PAL,
<i>SADDAM HUSSEIN.</i>

04:42.386 --> 04:44.386
SADDAM HUSSEIN,
THE IRAQI DICTATOR?

04:44.388 --> 04:47.022
HEY, RELAX, GUY,
I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE JOE.

04:47.024 --> 04:48.356
TAKE A REST!

04:48.358 --> 04:49.257
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:49.259 --> 04:50.926
YOU WANT TERRANCE AND PHILLIP
OUT OF CANADA.

04:50.928 --> 04:53.261
I WANT YOU TO BRING ME
AND MY FRIENDS<i> INTO</i> CANADA.

04:53.263 --> 04:55.664
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A FAIR TRADE, DOESN'T IT?

04:55.666 --> 04:56.665
SUPER,
LET'S GET STARTED.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.199
I'M NOT SURE
I SHOULD TRUST<i> YOU.</i>

04:58.201 --> 05:01.603
HEY, RELAX, GUY,
TRUST ME.

05:04.474 --> 05:06.841
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
WE DIDN'T FIND ANY TREASURE

05:06.843 --> 05:08.076
ON THE SUBWAY,

05:15.285 --> 05:17.586
BECAUSE YOU'RE
GODDAMNED UGLY, BOB.

05:17.588 --> 05:19.988
YOUR FACE LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY TRIED TO PUT OUT

05:19.990 --> 05:21.656
A FOREST FIRE
WITH A SCREWDRIVER.

05:21.658 --> 05:22.691
I CAN'T HELP
HOW I LOOK.

05:22.693 --> 05:25.627
BESIDES, IT'S NOT WHAT'S
ON THE OUTSIDE THAT MATTERS,

05:25.629 --> 05:27.062
IT'S WHAT'S
ON THE INSIDE.

05:27.064 --> 05:28.096
NO, IT ISN'T.

05:28.098 --> 05:28.863
( laughing )

05:28.865 --> 05:31.099
WANT TO SEE WHAT'S ON
THE INSIDE OF ME?

05:31.101 --> 05:32.167
( farting )

05:32.169 --> 05:32.934
( laughing )

05:32.936 --> 05:34.336
WAIT, WAIT,
I'VE GOT AN IDEA!

05:34.338 --> 05:36.605
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THIS
PAPER BAG OVER YOUR HEAD?

05:36.607 --> 05:38.139
YES, IF PEOPLE
CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE,

05:38.141 --> 05:40.675
THEY WON'T KNOW HOW
WRETCHEDLY UGLY YOU ARE.

05:40.677 --> 05:42.277
REALLY?
HEY, THANKS, YOU GUYS.

05:42.279 --> 05:44.412
MAYBE NOW I CAN
SCORE WITH CHICKS.

05:44.414 --> 05:45.347
SURE YOU CAN,
UGLY BOB.

05:45.349 --> 05:47.315
IF THEY CAN'T SEE HOW
HORRIBLY DISFIGURED YOU ARE,

05:47.317 --> 05:49.017
THEY'LL WANT TO
SLEEP WITH YOU.

05:49.019 --> 05:50.852
THANKS,
YOU GUYS.

05:53.523 --> 05:55.757
HELLO, BARKY,

06:38.268 --> 06:39.768
OH, YES.
DIDN'T I MENTION THAT?

06:39.770 --> 06:41.536

07:47.904 --> 07:49.204

07:49.206 --> 07:51.306
IRAN IS DANGEROUS,
YOU GUYS SHOULDN'T GO THERE.

07:51.308 --> 07:52.474
DAMNIT, MAN!

MY BUDDIES AND I ARE READY

08:57.274 --> 08:58.473
HAS EVERYTHING

HEY, RELAX, GUY.

09:05.615 --> 09:07.615
I'M GONNA KEEP
MY SIDE OF THE BARGAIN.

09:07.617 --> 09:09.417
ROGER, RED DRAGON.
SCOTT, OUT.

09:09.419 --> 09:12.754
I'VE GOT YOU NOW,
YOU FART-LOVING FART LOVERS.

09:16.159 --> 09:17.358
( farting )

09:17.360 --> 09:18.626
( laughing )

09:18.628 --> 09:21.362
( Phillip )
I GOT YA!

09:22.065 --> 09:23.031
( farting )

09:23.033 --> 09:25.567
( laughing )

09:29.806 --> 09:30.805
OH, PHILLIP.

09:30.807 --> 09:33.174
HOW WILL I EVER FIND
MY DAUGHTER IN THIS PLACE?

09:33.176 --> 09:34.909
WE DON'T SPEAK
THE LANGUAGE.

09:34.911 --> 09:36.144
WE ARE UNWELCOME
STRANGERS,

09:36.146 --> 09:37.812
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE TO BEGIN.

09:37.814 --> 09:39.614
OH, LOOK,
THERE SHE IS.

09:39.616 --> 09:40.982
OH, GOOD.

09:40.984 --> 09:42.083
WHO?
WHERE?

09:42.085 --> 09:42.984
I'M HERE,
SALLY.

09:42.986 --> 09:44.052
IT'S YOUR FATHER,
TERRANCE.

09:44.054 --> 09:45.820
I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU
FROM YOUR IRANIAN CAPTORS.

09:45.822 --> 09:49.224
SHE LOOKS A LOT MORE
LIKE CELINE DION THAN YOU.

09:49.226 --> 09:50.091
( farting )

09:50.093 --> 09:51.626
OH, NOW I SEE
THE RESEMBLANCE!

09:51.628 --> 09:53.928
WELL, ENOUGH OF IRAN,
LET'S GET HOME.

09:53.930 --> 09:54.896
( farting )

09:54.898 --> 09:56.831
( laughing )

09:58.501 --> 10:00.568
NOW THAT I HAVE
MY BASTARD DAUGHTER BACK,

10:00.570 --> 10:02.503
I FEEL LIKE GOING
TO CELINE DION'S HOUSE

10:02.505 --> 10:04.205
AND ASKING HER
TO MARRY ME AGAIN.

10:04.207 --> 10:06.708
OH, RASPBERRIES,
LOOKS LIKE I'M LOSING A FRIEND.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.743
NO, YOU'RE GAINING
A POP VOCALIST.

10:08.745 --> 10:11.779
OH MY GOD!
WHAT IS THIS?

10:12.015 --> 10:13.548
IS THIS CANADA?

10:13.550 --> 10:15.884
IT SEEMS
TO HAVE CHANGED.

10:15.886 --> 10:21.322
THIS IS MADNESS!

10:21.324 --> 10:22.423
WHAT'S GOING ON,
PHILLIP?

10:22.425 --> 10:25.293
HOW COULD CANADA HAVE CHANGED
SO MUCH WHILST WE WERE GONE?

10:25.295 --> 10:26.327
I DON'T KNOW,
TERRANCE.

10:26.329 --> 10:27.829
AND WHO IS THAT
IN ALL THESE PICTURES?

10:27.831 --> 10:30.098
I MUST TAKE MY BASTARD DAUGHTER
BACK TO CELINE DION

10:30.100 --> 10:32.700
AND SEE WHAT
SHE HAS TO SAY.

10:36.306 --> 10:38.439
I BROUGHT
OUR DAUGHTER BACK

10:38.441 --> 10:39.641
AND I WANT
TO TELL YOU THAT--

10:39.643 --> 10:42.310
TERRANCE, COULD YOU
COME BACK A LITTLE LATER?

10:42.312 --> 10:43.011
WHY?

10:43.013 --> 10:44.612
I'M JUST
A LITTLE BUSY.

10:44.614 --> 10:47.548
YOU'VE GOT A MAN OVER,
DON'T YOU, CELINE DION?

10:47.550 --> 10:48.750
WELL, I--

10:48.752 --> 10:49.484
HI, GUYS.

10:49.486 --> 10:50.752
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S UGLY BOB!

10:50.754 --> 10:52.320
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:52.322 --> 10:53.988
I'M DOING CELINE DION,
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

10:53.990 --> 10:55.356
OH, CELINE DION,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

10:55.358 --> 10:56.891
I WAS GOING TO
MAKE US A FAMILY AGAIN

10:56.893 --> 10:58.459
BUT NOW YOU'VE
SLEPT WITH UGLY BOB.

10:58.461 --> 11:00.295
WHY ARE YOU CALLING
HIM "UGLY BOB"?

11:00.297 --> 11:02.297
BECAUSE THAT'S HIS NAME,
YOU STUPID BITCH.

11:02.299 --> 11:04.232
YOU TOLD ME YOUR NAME
WAS "HANDSOME BOB"!

11:04.234 --> 11:06.768
LOOK AT HIM,
CELINE DION.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.202
( screaming )

11:08.204 --> 11:09.671
BEHOLD HIS
HORRIBLE FACE.

11:09.673 --> 11:11.806
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S HOPELESSLY UGLY,

11:11.808 --> 11:13.875
AND I AM PREGNANT
WITH HIS CHILD!

11:13.877 --> 11:14.809
WHAT?
NO...!

11:14.811 --> 11:17.512
I'M GOING TO HAVE
A FREAK BABY!

11:17.514 --> 11:19.914
OH,
THE HUMANITY!

11:22.185 --> 11:22.951
HEY, SADDAM,

11:22.953 --> 11:24.852
YOU HELPED ME GET RID OF
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP

11:24.854 --> 11:25.853
AND I APPRECIATE THAT,

11:25.855 --> 11:28.122
BUT WHY ARE PICTURES OF YOU
ALL OVER CANADA?

11:28.124 --> 11:29.057
HUH?
OH, THAT?

11:29.059 --> 11:30.892
DON'T WORRY, GUY,
YOU JUST NEED A REST.

11:30.894 --> 11:32.493
NO, I DON'T
NEED A REST.

11:32.495 --> 11:34.362
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

11:34.364 --> 11:35.229
HEY, RELAX,
FELLA.

11:35.231 --> 11:36.731
I'M JUST MAKING IT SO
THAT TERRANCE AND PHILLIP

11:36.733 --> 11:38.566
CAN NEVER COME BACK
TO CANADA AGAIN.

11:38.568 --> 11:39.701
I JUST NEED
A COUPLE OF DAYS

11:39.703 --> 11:40.935
THEN I'M GONNA
HEAD BACK TO IRAN.

11:40.937 --> 11:42.070
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
FROM IRAQ.

11:42.072 --> 11:44.305
IRAN, IRAQ,
WHAT THE HELL'S THE DIFFERENCE?

11:44.307 --> 11:45.640
RELAX, GUY.

11:48.011 --> 11:48.943
( farting )

11:48.945 --> 11:49.711
( laughing )

11:49.713 --> 11:51.412
PHILLIP, I'M CONVINCED
THAT SOMETHING

11:51.414 --> 11:53.314
VERY, VERY, NOT GOOD
IS HAPPENING TO CANADA.

11:53.316 --> 11:56.117
YES, I AGREE
WHOLE "FARTEDLY".

11:56.119 --> 11:56.884
( laughing )

11:56.886 --> 11:59.320
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

11:59.322 --> 12:00.321
OH, HELLO,
SCOTT.

12:00.323 --> 12:01.589
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

12:01.591 --> 12:03.825
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN IRAN
LOOKING FOR YOUR KIDNAPPED--

12:03.827 --> 12:05.927
I MEAN,
HOW ARE YOU GUYS TODAY?

12:05.929 --> 12:07.962
WAIT, WHAT WERE
YOU SAYING?

12:07.964 --> 12:08.796
NOTHING, WHY?

12:08.798 --> 12:10.331
HEY, SCOTT,
GUESS WHAT?

12:10.333 --> 12:10.898
WHAT?

12:10.900 --> 12:11.599
( farting )

12:11.601 --> 12:14.302
I HATE YOU
MORE THAN EVER!

12:14.304 --> 12:17.105
I ABSOLUTELY
ABHOR YOU BOTH!

12:17.540 --> 12:19.073
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING, SCOTT?

12:19.075 --> 12:21.175
I'M WISHING CANCER
UPON YOU.

12:21.177 --> 12:22.443
CANCER?!

12:22.445 --> 12:24.712
I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU
CANCER WITH MY MIND.

12:24.714 --> 12:25.580
STOP THAT!

12:25.582 --> 12:28.416
HEY, DON'T
GIVE<i> ME</i> CANCER.

12:31.388 --> 12:34.689
MR. HUSSEIN, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
IS BECOMING WORRIED.

12:34.691 --> 12:36.157
WORRIED?
ABOUT WHAT?

12:36.159 --> 12:37.425
TAKE A LOAD OFF,
RELAX.

12:37.427 --> 12:39.494
YOU SEEM TO BE
TAKING OVER CANADA.

12:39.496 --> 12:41.195
"TAKING OVER CANADA",
ME?

12:41.197 --> 12:44.232
YOU NEED A REST, FELLA,
I'M NOT HIDING ANY BOMBS.

12:44.234 --> 12:46.467
WE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT BOMBS.

12:46.469 --> 12:48.236
OH, YOU DIDN'T?
HEY, RELAX.

12:48.238 --> 12:49.937
WE'RE GIVING YOU
JUST THREE YEARS

12:49.939 --> 12:51.639
TO CLEAR YOUR FORCES
OUT OF CANADA.

12:51.641 --> 12:54.208
AFTER THAT WE'RE GONNA
BOMB ALL OF IRAN.

12:54.210 --> 12:55.009
I'M FROM IRAQ.

12:55.011 --> 12:57.478
IRAN, IRAQ,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

12:57.480 --> 12:59.047
I HATE
AMERICANS.

12:59.049 --> 13:00.481
PLEASE LET ME
KILL THEM.

13:00.483 --> 13:01.949
NO, NO, YOU NEED
TO RELAX, GUY.

13:01.951 --> 13:03.684
REMEMBER THE PLAN,
FIST WE TAKE OVER CANADA,

13:03.686 --> 13:06.154
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO BEST OF
THE FEMALE POP VOCALISTS.

13:06.156 --> 13:07.722
AFTER THAT,
WE'LL TAKE OVER THE U.S.,

13:07.724 --> 13:10.324
THEN EUROPE, THEN CHINA,
THEN NEWFOUNDLAND,

13:10.326 --> 13:11.993
THEN THE WORLD!

13:11.995 --> 13:12.693
( laughing )

13:12.695 --> 13:13.561
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

13:13.563 --> 13:14.595
NOTHING,
RELAX, BUDDY.

13:14.597 --> 13:17.331
SADDAM, TERRANCE AND PHILLIP
ARE BACK IN CANADA.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.099
OH, REALLY?

13:18.101 --> 13:19.734
YOU PROMISED ME
THEY'D BE GONE FOR GOOD.

13:19.736 --> 13:21.269
THAT WAS YOUR
PART OF THE BARGAIN.

13:21.271 --> 13:22.070
I CHANGED MY MIND.

13:22.072 --> 13:24.739
PRAY THAT I DON'T
CHANGE IT ANY FURTHER.

13:24.741 --> 13:28.342
THIS DEAL'S GETTING
WORSE ALL THE TIME.

13:30.180 --> 13:32.513
HEY, TERRANCE, LET'S WATCH
AMERICAN TELEVISION.

13:32.515 --> 13:34.549
YEAH, WE CAN GET
SATELLITE FEED FROM THE U.S.

13:34.551 --> 13:36.918
AND WATCH ALL
THE STUPID TV SHOWS.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.153
OH, LOOK,
HERE'S A SHOW.

13:39.155 --> 13:40.988
<i>!@#$%</i> you.

13:41.558 --> 13:42.223
STUPID.

13:42.225 --> 13:43.958
GODDAMN,
THEIR TV SHOWS ARE LAME.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.394
The father of
Eric Cartman...

13:46.396 --> 13:47.195
( laughing )

13:47.197 --> 13:49.030
LOOK AT THOSE
SILLY AMERICAN HEADS.

13:49.032 --> 13:50.565
THEY LOOK
LIKE GROUNDHOGS.

13:50.567 --> 13:52.967
And in other news, it appears
that Saddam Hussein

13:52.969 --> 13:55.536
has finally signed an agreement
to let the U.S.

13:55.538 --> 13:57.171
inspect his
military operations.

13:57.173 --> 13:59.640
When asked if he would uphold
his side of the agreement,

13:59.642 --> 14:02.677
Hussein replied, quote,
"Hey, relax fella,

14:02.679 --> 14:04.345
you need
a rest, guy."

14:04.347 --> 14:05.113
HEY, PHILLIP,

14:05.115 --> 14:06.347
ISN'T THAT
THE SMELLY GENTLEMEN

14:06.349 --> 14:08.082
WE'VE SEEN IN PICTURES
ALL OVER TOWN?

14:08.084 --> 14:09.117
YES, IT IS,
TERRANCE.

14:09.119 --> 14:10.017
ACCORDING TO
THAT NEWSY,

14:10.019 --> 14:11.652
HE'S SOME KIND OF
TURKISH DICTATOR.

14:11.654 --> 14:13.688
WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND EAT<i> KROFF</i> DINNER

14:13.690 --> 14:16.023
AND LET CANADA
BE OVERRUN BY THE TURKS.

14:16.025 --> 14:16.958
( phone )

14:16.960 --> 14:17.992
( laughing )

14:17.994 --> 14:20.661
THAT FART SOUNDED LIKE
A RINGING PHONE, TERRANCE.

14:20.663 --> 14:22.396
IT SURE DID,
PHILLIP.

14:22.398 --> 14:23.131
( phone )

14:23.133 --> 14:25.666
OH, WAIT,
THAT IS THE PHONE.

14:25.668 --> 14:27.101
HELLO?

14:27.103 --> 14:28.703
Terrance,
this is Scott.

14:28.705 --> 14:29.637
HI...
IT'S SCOTT.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.739
( Phillip )
TELL HIM HE'S
A SMELLY BASTARD.

14:31.741 --> 14:33.207
PHILLIP SAYS
HELLO, SCOTT.

14:33.209 --> 14:34.242
Just shut up
and listen.

14:34.244 --> 14:35.676
YOU'VE UNLEASHED
A MONSTER ONTO CANADA.

14:35.678 --> 14:36.911
AND ONLY YOU
CAN GET RID OF HIM,

14:36.913 --> 14:39.380
EVEN THOUGH I HATE YOU
AND I WISH YOU HAD CANCER.

14:39.382 --> 14:41.282
YOU ARE SUCH
A DICK, SCOTT.

14:41.284 --> 14:42.049
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:42.051 --> 14:42.783
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:42.785 --> 14:43.551
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:43.553 --> 14:44.252
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:44.254 --> 14:44.986
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:44.988 --> 14:46.621
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:46.623 --> 14:48.222
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:48.224 --> 14:48.990
YOU'RE A DICK.

14:48.992 --> 14:49.957
YOU'RE THE
MOST ANNOYING DICK.

14:49.959 --> 14:52.193
YOU GIVE OTHER CANADIANS
A BAD NAME, AND IF I HAD MY--

14:52.195 --> 14:54.929
I'M SORRY, SCOTT,
COULD YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE?

14:54.931 --> 14:55.696
Sure.

14:55.698 --> 14:56.764
( farting )

14:56.766 --> 14:57.598
( laughing )

14:57.600 --> 14:59.000
HOW DO YOU
LIKE THAT, SCOTT?

14:59.002 --> 15:00.768
YOU SONOFABITCH,
I'LL GET YOU IF--

15:00.770 --> 15:04.038
OH, I HAVE ANOTHER CALL,
CAN YOU HANG ON?

15:04.040 --> 15:04.639
SURE.

15:04.641 --> 15:05.373
( farting )

15:05.375 --> 15:07.074
OH, THAT WAS
"SIR SMELLY".

15:07.076 --> 15:08.176
HE SAYS HELLO.

15:08.178 --> 15:08.976
GODDAMNIT!

15:08.978 --> 15:10.344
OH, WAIT A SECOND,
SCOTT.

15:10.346 --> 15:10.978
SURE.

15:10.980 --> 15:12.146
I MEAN, NO!

15:12.148 --> 15:13.181
IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE CANADA

15:13.183 --> 15:15.183
YOU'LL MEET ME AT
KARL'S KROFF DINNER RESTAURANT

15:15.185 --> 15:17.084
IN HALF AN HOUR.

15:18.588 --> 15:19.720
OH, UGLY BOB,
I'M SO CONFUSED.

15:19.722 --> 15:23.324
I LOVE YOUR PERSONALITY,
BUT YOU ARE SO WRETCHEDLY UGLY.

15:23.326 --> 15:25.693
MAYBE THE BABY WILL HAVE
YOUR FACE INSTEAD OF MINE.

15:25.695 --> 15:26.928
WE CAN
ONLY HOPE.

15:26.930 --> 15:27.929
I SUPPOSE
WE'LL BE OKAY

15:27.931 --> 15:30.331
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
THAT BAG ON YOUR HEAD.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.899
WHAT'S THIS?

15:31.901 --> 15:34.268
HEY, THERE,
MY NAME'S SADDAM.

15:34.270 --> 15:35.336
I'M A BIG FAN
OF POLO.

15:35.338 --> 15:37.238
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING A LONG TIME
FOR YOU, CELINE DION.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.307
OH, NO YOU DON'T,
SHE'S MY BITCH.

15:39.309 --> 15:40.174
WHO ARE YOU?

15:40.176 --> 15:41.242
MY FRIENDS
CALL ME "UGLY BOB"

15:41.244 --> 15:43.344
BECAUSE I HAVE THE FEATURES
OF A DEFORMED BURN VICTIM.

15:43.346 --> 15:45.580
I THOUGHT ALL CANADIANS
LOOKED ALIKE.

15:45.582 --> 15:46.747
LET ME SEE.

15:46.749 --> 15:48.783
( screaming )

15:49.018 --> 15:50.084
WELL,
I'M SORRY, GUY.

15:50.086 --> 15:52.286
I COULD CURE
THAT FACE OF YOURS.

15:52.288 --> 15:52.987
YOU CAN?

15:52.989 --> 15:53.888
I JUST NEED A FAVOR.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.189
THERE'S A CANADIAN
FOOTBALL GAME TOMORROW.

15:55.191 --> 15:57.258
THE OTTAWA ROUGHRIDERS AGAINST
THE VANCOUVER ROUGHRIDERS.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.794
THERE I WILL OFFICIALLY
TURN THE CANADIAN FLAG

15:59.796 --> 16:01.495
OVER TO MY
IRANIAN ONE.

16:01.497 --> 16:02.396
WHAT?
WHY?

16:02.398 --> 16:04.265
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,
TAKE A LOAD OFF.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.900
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,
LOOK OVER HERE.

16:05.902 --> 16:07.168
ALL I NEED
IS CELINE DION

16:07.170 --> 16:09.070
TO SING OUR IRANIAN
NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE GAME

16:09.072 --> 16:11.138
TO FINALIZE MY HOSTILE
TAKEOVER OF CANADA.

16:11.140 --> 16:13.741
DID YOU SAY HOSTILE
TAKEOVER OF CANADA?

16:13.743 --> 16:16.811
NO, NO, RELAX THERE,
FELLA.

16:20.583 --> 16:23.951
SCOTT SAID TO MEET HIM HERE
BUT HE'S NOT SHOWING UP.

16:23.953 --> 16:24.685
( farting )

16:24.687 --> 16:25.653
( laughing )

16:25.655 --> 16:26.721
WHILE WE'RE WAITING,

16:26.723 --> 16:28.422
WHY DON'T WE SEARCH
FOR TREASURE?

16:28.424 --> 16:31.525
OH, GOOD IDEA,
LET'S SEARCH FOR TREASURE.

16:32.629 --> 16:34.662
WHAT ARE YOU
IDIOTS DOING?

16:34.664 --> 16:36.163
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR TREASURE.

16:36.165 --> 16:37.365
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF METAPHOR

16:37.367 --> 16:40.101
FOR A KIND OF SEARCH
THAT CAN'T BE DESCRIBED?

16:40.103 --> 16:41.902
NO, WE'RE SEARCHING
FOR TREASURE.

16:41.904 --> 16:43.738
LISTEN,
I HAVE AN INSIDE SCOOP.

16:43.740 --> 16:44.805
THERE'S AN
IRAQI DICTATOR

16:44.807 --> 16:46.941
WHO IS QUIETLY AND SLOWLY
TAKING OVER CANADA.

16:46.943 --> 16:48.409
YES, YOU MEAN
SADDAM SMELLY.

16:48.411 --> 16:49.377
WE SAW HIM
ON THE TELE.

16:49.379 --> 16:51.445
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

16:51.447 --> 16:52.346
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:52.348 --> 16:53.381
IT'S YOUR FAULT
HE'S HERE.

16:53.383 --> 16:55.082
YOU BROUGHT THE IRAQIS
BACK WITH YOU ON YOUR PLANE

16:55.084 --> 16:57.051
WHEN YOU RESCUED
YOUR KIDNAPPED DAUGHTER.

16:57.053 --> 16:58.686
YOU MEAN
WE ARE TO BLAME?

16:58.688 --> 17:00.621
THAT'S RIGHT, AND NOW
YOU MUST MAKE AMENDS.

17:00.623 --> 17:03.324
TOMORROW, SADDAM WILL TRY TO
FINALIZE HIS TAKEOVER OF CANADA

17:03.326 --> 17:05.226
AT THE ROUGHRIDERS/ROUGHRIDERS
FOOTBALL GAME.

17:05.228 --> 17:07.695
IT WILL BE YOUR ONLY SHOT
AT WIPING THEM ALL OUT.

17:07.697 --> 17:08.829
HERE, TAKE THIS.

17:08.831 --> 17:09.797
WHAT IS THIS?

17:09.799 --> 17:10.531
IT'S A BOMB.

17:10.533 --> 17:11.899
YOU MUST STRAP IT TO YOURSELVES,
GO TO THE GAME,

17:11.901 --> 17:15.002
AND SACRIFICE YOUR LIVES
TO TAKE OUT SADDAM'S MINIONS.

17:15.004 --> 17:16.070
THAT SOUNDS SCARY.

17:16.072 --> 17:17.905
WELL, YOU MUST
DO IT FOR CANADA.

17:17.907 --> 17:19.640
FOR CANADA,
TERRANCE.

17:19.642 --> 17:22.076
FOR CANADA,
PHILLIP.

17:22.245 --> 17:23.644
YES, TERRANCE AND PHILLIP.

17:23.646 --> 17:24.712
AND WHEN
THE DUST IS SETTLED

17:24.714 --> 17:26.480
CANADA WILL BE RID OF
BOTH THE IRAQIS

17:26.482 --> 17:32.453
AND YOUR IMMATURE
FART HUMOR.

17:32.455 --> 17:35.756
WELL, PHILLIP, I'M VERY SAD
THAT WE HAVE TO DIE FOR CANADA.

17:35.758 --> 17:36.424
YES.

17:36.426 --> 17:38.392
THIS BOMB WILL BLOW US
TO SMITHEREENS.

17:38.394 --> 17:39.627
BUT WE REALLY
HAVE NO CHOICE.

17:39.629 --> 17:42.463
ONLY OUR DEATHS
CAN BRING CANADA LIFE.

17:42.465 --> 17:43.431
( farting )

17:43.433 --> 17:44.398
( laughing )

17:44.400 --> 17:45.266
THAT'S FUNNY.

17:45.268 --> 17:46.400
WAIT A MINUTE,
TERRANCE,

17:46.402 --> 17:47.868
THIS FART
GIVES ME PAUSE.

17:47.870 --> 17:48.636
WHY IS THAT?

17:48.638 --> 17:49.670
THAT SMELLY
SADDAM HUSSEIN,

17:49.672 --> 17:51.972
HE USES GERMAN CHEMICAL WARFARE,
DOES HE NOT?

17:51.974 --> 17:53.441
YES, APPARENTLY
HE DOES.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.009
TERRANCE,
GET THE PHONE BOOK.

17:55.011 --> 17:56.310
WE MUST CALL EVERY
CANADIAN WE CAN.

17:56.312 --> 17:59.080
OH, PHILLIP, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAVE AN IDEA.

17:59.082 --> 18:00.681
I DO,
TERRANCE.

18:00.683 --> 18:01.716
( dialing )

18:01.718 --> 18:02.650
( farting )

18:02.652 --> 18:04.318
( laughing )

18:05.088 --> 18:08.622
( announcer )
THE ROUGHRIDERS ARE
REALLY GIVING THE ROUGHRIDERS

18:08.624 --> 18:09.657
A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

18:09.659 --> 18:11.592
ALL ELSE ASIDE, I MUST SAY
THAT THE ROUGHRIDERS

18:11.594 --> 18:15.296
ARE SIMPLY OUTMATCHED
BY THESE ROUGHRIDERS.

18:16.899 --> 18:17.698
( whistle )

18:17.700 --> 18:18.999
AND THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE US TO HALFTIME.

18:19.001 --> 18:21.202
BE SURE TO STICK AROUND
FOR THE HALFTIME SHOW,

18:21.204 --> 18:23.003
SADDAM AND
THE ELECTRIC IRAQIS,

18:23.005 --> 18:25.039
IN A SALUTE
TO HOSTILE TAKEOVERS.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.741
( band playing )

18:28.911 --> 18:31.312
WELL, I GUESS
IT'S TIME, OLD FRIEND.

18:31.314 --> 18:33.848
YES, PREPARE.

18:34.016 --> 18:35.616
HELLO TO MY
CANADIAN FRIENDS.

18:35.618 --> 18:38.452
EVERYBODY, RELAX,
TAKE A REST,
PUT YOUR FEET UP.

18:38.454 --> 18:39.487
THOSE DOGS
ARE BARKING.

18:39.489 --> 18:42.056
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED SOME
CHANGES TO YOUR COUNTRY.

18:42.058 --> 18:44.492
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,
THE CHANGES WILL CONTINUE.

18:44.494 --> 18:46.227
I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE
ONCE AND FOR ALL

18:46.229 --> 18:50.965
THAT CANADA WILL NOW
BE KNOWN AS "NEW BAGHDAD".

18:54.170 --> 18:55.002
( gasping )

18:55.004 --> 18:56.837
YOU WILL BOW DOWN TO ME
AS YOUR RULER.

18:56.839 --> 18:59.740
YOU WILL OBEY MY LAWS
OR YOU WILL BE KILLED.

18:59.742 --> 19:00.508
( laughing )

19:00.510 --> 19:02.910
AND NOW YOU WILL SING
THE IRAQI NATIONAL ANTHEM

19:02.912 --> 19:05.446
OR YOU WILL BE
STABBED IN THE HEAD.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.515
( Arabic )

19:08.551 --> 19:09.583
NOW, PHILLIP?

19:09.585 --> 19:10.985
NOW, TERRANCE.

19:10.987 --> 19:13.387
( blowing bugle )

19:15.792 --> 19:18.058
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

19:18.060 --> 19:19.860
( Arabic )

19:21.431 --> 19:23.731
( everyone farting )

19:25.902 --> 19:26.901
( screaming )

19:26.903 --> 19:29.003
THEY'RE USING
CHEMICAL WARFARE.

19:29.005 --> 19:31.205
HOW COULD THEY?

19:34.610 --> 19:36.043
( cheering )

19:40.850 --> 19:42.683
WE DID IT,
PHILLIP.

19:42.685 --> 19:44.718
WE DESTROYED
THE TURKS!

19:44.720 --> 19:47.254
OH, GLORIOUS DAY.

19:54.931 --> 19:56.964
TERRANCE, TERRANCE,
YOU'VE SAVED CANADA.

19:56.966 --> 19:59.166
IT WAS ALL
PHILLIP'S IDEA.

19:59.168 --> 20:00.634
GOD BLESS YOU,
PHILLIP.

20:00.636 --> 20:02.002
DON'T TOUCH ME,
UGLY BOB.

20:02.004 --> 20:03.204
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

20:03.206 --> 20:04.538
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE BLOWN UP!

20:04.540 --> 20:05.739
WE CAME UP WITH
A BETTER PLAN.

20:05.741 --> 20:07.475
YOU SEE, SCOTT,
AFTER ALL YOUR CRITICISM,

20:07.477 --> 20:09.677
IT WAS FARTING
THAT SAVED CANADA.

20:09.679 --> 20:11.345
OH, THAT IS
SO JUVENILE.

20:11.347 --> 20:13.547
HEY, SCOTT,
DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

20:13.549 --> 20:14.482
OF COURSE.

20:14.484 --> 20:15.382
( farting )

20:15.384 --> 20:17.117
HOW DO YOU LIKE
<i>THEM</i> APPLES?

20:17.119 --> 20:20.654
I HATE YOU
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!

20:20.990 --> 20:21.989
OH, CELINE DION.

20:21.991 --> 20:23.591
YOU NEVER FINISHED
THAT NATIONAL ANTHEM.
