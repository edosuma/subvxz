00:47.400 --> 00:52.100
A beginning
is a very delicate time.

00:52.160 --> 00:57.400
Know then, that it is
the year 10,191.

00:57.460 --> 01:02.360
The known universe is ruled by the
Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

01:02.430 --> 01:05.770
my father.

01:05.830 --> 01:09.500
In this time, the most
precious substance in the universe...

01:09.570 --> 01:12.300
is the spice, melange.

01:12.370 --> 01:16.000
The spice extends life.

01:16.070 --> 01:20.400
The spice
expands consciousness.

01:20.470 --> 01:25.140
The spice is vital
to space travel.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.700
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

01:27.770 --> 01:32.100
who the spice has mutated
over 4,000 years,

01:32.170 --> 01:34.870
use the orange spice gas,

01:34.940 --> 01:39.270
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

01:39.340 --> 01:43.510
That is, travel to any part
of the universe...

01:43.570 --> 01:45.800
without moving.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.810
Oh, yes.

01:47.870 --> 01:50.140
I forgot to tell you.

01:50.210 --> 01:55.810
The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire universe.

01:55.870 --> 02:01.410
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

02:01.470 --> 02:07.210
Hidden away within the rocks of these
deserts are a people known as the Fremen,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.080
who have long
held a prophecy...

02:10.139 --> 02:12.710
that a man would come,

02:12.780 --> 02:14.780
a messiah,

02:14.840 --> 02:18.740
who would lead them
to true freedom.

02:18.810 --> 02:22.410
The planet is Arrakis,

02:22.480 --> 02:27.250
also known as Dune.

03:53.260 --> 03:56.730
A secret report
within the Guild.

03:56.790 --> 03:59.930
Four planets have come
to our attention...

03:59.990 --> 04:04.300
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.460
Planet Arrakis,
source of the spice.

04:08.530 --> 04:12.730
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

04:12.800 --> 04:17.160
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

04:17.230 --> 04:22.270
Planet Kaitain, home of the Emperor
of the known universe.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.200
Send a third-stage
guild navigator to Kaitain...

04:27.270 --> 04:30.270
to demand details
from the Emperor.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.830
The spice must flow.

05:19.670 --> 05:23.070
- Father,
- Irulan, you must leave.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.010
A third-stage guild navigator...

05:46.080 --> 05:48.150
will be here within minutes.

05:48.210 --> 05:50.150
We felt his presence.

05:50.210 --> 05:52.450
I shall want telepathy
during his visit...

05:52.510 --> 05:54.580
and a report
when we're finished.

05:54.650 --> 05:58.580
I am your Truthsayer,
my lord.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.510
He's here, my lord.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.150
The Bene Gesserit witch
must leave.

06:32.220 --> 06:35.290
Leave us.

06:35.350 --> 06:38.220
Yes, my lord.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.290
We are alone.

07:34.760 --> 07:39.930
- We have just folded space from Ix.
- Yes?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.930
How was your journey?

07:44.000 --> 07:49.230
Many machines on Ix.
New machines.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.300
Oh? Yes.

07:52.370 --> 07:57.630
Better than those on Richese.

07:57.700 --> 08:03.440
You are transparent.
I see many things.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.970
I see plans within plans.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.600
I see two great houses,

08:11.740 --> 08:16.970
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen, feuding.

08:17.070 --> 08:21.870
- I see you behind it.
- Yes.

08:21.970 --> 08:25.770
You must share with us.

08:25.870 --> 08:29.040
The Atreides House
is building a secret army

08:29.140 --> 08:31.110
using a technique unknown to us.

08:31.170 --> 08:34.110
A technique involving sound.

08:34.169 --> 08:36.970
The duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

08:37.070 --> 08:39.210
He could threaten me.

08:39.309 --> 08:43.179
I have ordered House Atreides
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

08:43.240 --> 08:46.040
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

08:46.140 --> 08:50.610
House Atreides will not refuse because of the
tremendous power they think they will gain.

08:50.710 --> 08:52.640
Then, at an appointed time,

08:52.710 --> 08:55.910
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis...

08:56.010 --> 08:58.540
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

08:58.640 --> 09:03.550
I have promised the baron five legions
of my Sardaukar terror troops.

09:03.610 --> 09:08.110
So the Harkonnens
will rid you of House Atreides.

09:08.210 --> 09:09.850
Yes!

09:09.950 --> 09:12.880
One small point.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.210
Here it comes.

09:15.310 --> 09:18.710
We ourselves perceive
a slight problem...

09:18.780 --> 09:21.450
within House Atreides.

09:21.550 --> 09:26.080
Paul. Paul Atreides.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.720
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.480
I mean Paul Atreides.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.020
We want him killed.

09:38.020 --> 09:43.220
I did not say this.
I am not here.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.290
I understand.

10:14.990 --> 10:20.590
Why would they want
the duke's son killed?

10:23.830 --> 10:29.630
We must have a look
at Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

10:44.030 --> 10:48.230
The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood
for 90 generations...

10:48.330 --> 10:50.100
has been manipulating
bloodlines...

10:50.200 --> 10:54.300
to produce the Kwisatz Haderach,
a super being.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.400
On Caladan, Jessica,
a member of the sisterhood...

10:58.500 --> 11:02.030
and the bound concubine
of Duke Leto Atreides,

11:02.130 --> 11:05.100
had been ordered
to bear only daughters.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.930
Because of her love
for the duke...

11:07.030 --> 11:11.500
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son...

11:11.600 --> 11:16.030
Paul... Paul Atreides.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.700
Here we are now, Caladan.

11:26.800 --> 11:32.170
And 19 light-years beyond,
beyond Bene Tleilax.

11:32.240 --> 11:36.040
The training planet
of the Mentats, the human computers.

11:36.140 --> 11:39.300
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.470
There. Arrakis.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.240
Spice mining.

11:43.340 --> 11:46.110
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand...

11:46.210 --> 11:48.670
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

11:48.740 --> 11:52.510
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

11:52.610 --> 11:57.910
Weather. See storms.
No precipitation.

11:58.010 --> 12:01.710
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

12:01.810 --> 12:05.640
And the Harkonnens are near.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.810
There. Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

12:08.910 --> 12:10.840
The enemy.

12:10.910 --> 12:13.810
The Baron Harkonnen has sworn
to destroy House Atreides...

12:13.880 --> 12:16.440
and steal the ducal signet ring
for himself.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.050
I know, Thufir.
I'm sitting with my back to the door.

12:39.150 --> 12:43.820
I heard you, Dr. Yueh,

12:43.920 --> 12:45.920
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

12:46.020 --> 12:49.450
Those sounds
could be imitated!

12:51.480 --> 12:53.420
I'd know the difference.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.150
Yes, perhaps you would at that.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.690
My father sent you to test me.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.920
Music, then?

13:04.020 --> 13:08.950
No music.
I'm packing this for the crossing.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.750
- Shield practice.
- Gurney, we had practice this morning.

13:12.850 --> 13:14.790
I'm not in the mood.

13:14.850 --> 13:16.790
Not in the mood!

13:16.850 --> 13:21.290
- Mood's a thing for cattle and love play, not fighting!
- I'm sorry, Gurney.

13:21.390 --> 13:23.660
Not sorry enough.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.890
What's wrong with Gurney?
He's not faking this.

13:37.990 --> 13:41.930
Now, guard yourself for true!

14:01.160 --> 14:03.400
Is this what you seek?

14:03.500 --> 14:08.460
Good. The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.560
But, uh, look down.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.230
We'd have joined each other in death.

14:17.330 --> 14:20.060
You did seem finally
to get the mood.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.870
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

14:30.930 --> 14:33.430
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

14:33.530 --> 14:36.370
I'd have given you a good scar
to remind you.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.800
Things have been
so serious here lately.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.970
Soon we leave for Arrakis.

14:45.070 --> 14:48.040
Arrakis is real.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.600
The Harkonnens are real.

14:52.240 --> 14:57.700
Dr. Yueh, do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

14:57.800 --> 15:01.470
I have obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

15:01.570 --> 15:05.010
Only 125 meters long.

15:05.110 --> 15:07.640
- Only?
- There have been documented sightings...

15:07.740 --> 15:12.910
of worms as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

15:13.010 --> 15:16.640
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

15:16.740 --> 15:21.380
The desert belt and the south
polar region are marked forbidden.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.610
How do the Fremen survive there?

15:23.710 --> 15:26.080
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

15:26.180 --> 15:28.910
They live in the deep desert,
some in the cities.

15:29.010 --> 15:31.980
They have blue within blue eyes.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.610
Oh, the eyes. Yes.

15:35.710 --> 15:38.680
The saturation of the blood
by the spice, melange.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.510
Could the spice affect us
in other ways?

15:41.610 --> 15:43.750
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

15:43.850 --> 15:47.580
For one, the Harkonnens
would not have given up...

15:47.680 --> 15:51.150
their CHOAM Company contract
so easily.

15:52.210 --> 15:55.680
The Harkonnens
are our enemies, yes.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.210
But behind them, I suspect,
is the Emperor.

16:00.050 --> 16:02.020
You'll make
a formidable duke.

16:07.620 --> 16:13.250
Now remember, the first step
in avoiding a trap...

16:13.350 --> 16:15.550
is knowing
of its existence.

16:15.650 --> 16:19.690
I know. But if it is a trap,
then why are we going?

16:19.790 --> 16:21.720
We have our new army.

16:21.790 --> 16:26.720
Dr. Yueh,
put the weirding module on him.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.850
Well.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.820
Clear and lock the room!

16:52.890 --> 16:56.430
Detachment, stand down.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.260
Activate a fighter.

17:24.329 --> 17:26.430
Make the range two meters.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.940
Precise control.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.010
Duncan!

18:49.310 --> 18:53.540
Paul. I was just on my way
to say good-bye to you.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.340
I have to go on ahead.
I won't be seeing you for a while.

18:57.410 --> 18:59.150
I wish you were
coming with us. Why?

18:59.210 --> 19:03.880
Something for your father.
He wants to talk to you.

19:03.950 --> 19:05.780
I'll see you on Arrakis.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.810
May the hand of God
be with you.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.050
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

19:29.350 --> 19:32.520
- Father.
- Thank you for joining me, Paul.

19:32.580 --> 19:37.450
Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
three generations.

19:37.520 --> 19:42.620
He swears you are the finest student
he has ever taught.

19:42.690 --> 19:46.050
Yueh, Gurney and Duncan
say the same.

19:49.220 --> 19:52.650
- Makes me feel very proud.
- I want you to be proud of me.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.620
I'll miss the sea.

20:09.790 --> 20:12.960
But a person needs
new experiences.

20:13.020 --> 20:16.460
They jar something
deep inside,

20:16.520 --> 20:20.660
allowing him to grow.

20:20.730 --> 20:26.730
Without change,
something sleeps inside us...

20:28.960 --> 20:30.890
and seldom awakens.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.400
The sleeper must awaken.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.200
Arrakis.

21:06.270 --> 21:11.270
Dune... Desert planet...

21:13.770 --> 21:16.570
I will kill you.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.740
The second moon.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.840
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

21:41.870 --> 21:44.910
I know she has come to test him.

21:44.970 --> 21:49.470
No man has ever been tested
with the box.

21:49.540 --> 21:52.910
Tonight, I may lose my son.

22:15.710 --> 22:21.480
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

22:21.550 --> 22:22.710
Jessica!

22:22.780 --> 22:24.950
It meant so much to him.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.880
You thought only of a duke's desire
for a son?

22:28.950 --> 22:30.880
Desires don't come into this.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.910
An Atreides daughter
could have been wed...

22:33.980 --> 22:37.220
to a Harkonnen heir
and sealed the breach.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.650
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

22:40.720 --> 22:46.420
I vowed never
to regret my decision.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.880
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

22:49.950 --> 22:52.680
And your son will pay with you.

22:52.750 --> 22:58.950
Arrakis... Dune...
Desert planet.

23:00.790 --> 23:04.720
Moving. Moving.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.590
We'll salvage what we can.

23:28.660 --> 23:32.260
But I can tell you,
dear God...

23:32.320 --> 23:34.920
For the father, nothing.

23:34.990 --> 23:37.530
For the father, nothing?

23:37.590 --> 23:40.830
Did you really think you could bear
the Kwisatz Haderach?

23:40.890 --> 23:46.090
The universe's super being?
How dare you?

23:46.160 --> 23:49.560
My greatest student.

23:49.630 --> 23:53.430
And my greatest disappointment.

23:56.630 --> 24:00.900
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.500
Good. Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

24:03.560 --> 24:06.800
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one quarter of an hour.

24:10.200 --> 24:15.570
Paul, this is very important.

24:19.330 --> 24:23.370
Kwisatz Haderach. The super being.

24:23.430 --> 24:26.170
For the father, nothing.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.570
Vas.

24:56.740 --> 25:00.410
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

25:00.470 --> 25:04.170
She's going to observe you.

25:07.470 --> 25:10.510
- Please.
- Jessica,

25:10.570 --> 25:12.370
you know it must be done.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.910
Your Reverence.

25:14.970 --> 25:17.010
What does she fear?

25:17.780 --> 25:20.180
What about my father?

25:20.240 --> 25:21.680
Paul.

25:21.740 --> 25:25.780
Listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.280
Now you...

25:37.350 --> 25:39.280
come here!

25:39.350 --> 25:42.380
She's using the Voice.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.380
No.

25:44.450 --> 25:46.980
Some strength there.

25:47.050 --> 25:49.310
Surprising.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.410
Come here!

26:10.320 --> 26:14.380
Do you see this?

26:14.450 --> 26:17.090
Put your right hand
in the box.

26:17.150 --> 26:19.090
What's in the box?

26:19.150 --> 26:22.990
Pain. Stop!

26:23.050 --> 26:25.750
Put your hand in the box.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.690
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

26:33.750 --> 26:38.360
This one kills only animals.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.790
Are you suggesting
a duke's son is an animal?

26:40.860 --> 26:44.490
Let us say I suggest
you may be human.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.660
Your awareness may be powerful enough
to control your instincts.

26:48.720 --> 26:53.520
Your instinct will be
to remove your hand from the box.

26:53.590 --> 26:57.090
If you do so, you die.

27:00.230 --> 27:04.030
You will feel...

27:04.090 --> 27:08.490
an itching.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.260
There.

27:11.330 --> 27:15.360
Now the itching becomes...

27:15.430 --> 27:17.330
burning.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.530
Heat upon heat.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.530
- Upon heat!
- It burns.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.660
Silence! Silence!

27:23.730 --> 27:27.400
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

27:27.460 --> 27:30.030
Fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration.

27:30.100 --> 27:32.030
I will face my fear.

27:32.100 --> 27:36.100
I will permit it to pass
over me and through me.

27:36.160 --> 27:40.030
- I must not fear.
- You feel the flesh crisping?

27:40.100 --> 27:43.530
...is the little death
that brings total obliteration.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.430
Flesh... dropping off.

27:47.500 --> 27:51.030
Fear is the little... death!

27:51.100 --> 27:53.100
I must not fear.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.870
Fear is the little death.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.940
I'm...

27:59.140 --> 28:01.040
- The pain!
- No!

28:01.100 --> 28:02.640
Enough.

28:05.540 --> 28:10.670
Kull wahad. No woman child
ever withstood that much.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.940
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it,

28:17.010 --> 28:18.940
young human.

28:19.010 --> 28:22.970
Do it!

28:28.610 --> 28:30.910
Pain by nerve induction.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.840
A human can resist any pain.

28:32.910 --> 28:35.710
Our test is crisis
and observation.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.110
I see the truth of it.

28:38.180 --> 28:42.010
Could he be the one? Maybe.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.910
But will he be
ours to control?

28:46.580 --> 28:49.440
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

28:52.810 --> 28:56.350
Do you know
of the Water of Life?

28:56.410 --> 28:59.950
The bile from the newborn worms
of Arrakis?

29:00.010 --> 29:02.480
- I have heard of it.
- It is very dangerous.

29:02.550 --> 29:08.010
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.850
There is a place
terrifying to us,

29:12.910 --> 29:15.080
to women.

29:15.150 --> 29:20.780
It is said
a man will come,

29:20.850 --> 29:23.980
the Kwisatz Haderach.

29:24.050 --> 29:28.480
He will go
where we cannot.

29:28.550 --> 29:31.020
Many men have tried.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.050
They tried and failed?

29:33.120 --> 29:36.020
They tried and died.

29:36.090 --> 29:38.390
Jessica.

29:44.020 --> 29:48.720
My son lives.

29:51.350 --> 29:54.890
I sense your teachings in him.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.590
Ignore the regular order
of training.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.590
His safety requires the Voice.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.590
I've heard enough of my safety.

30:02.660 --> 30:04.990
What about my father?

30:05.060 --> 30:07.020
I heard your talking.

30:07.090 --> 30:10.420
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not.

30:10.490 --> 30:13.130
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

30:13.190 --> 30:17.490
- What can be done has been done.
- Mother, tell me.

30:41.960 --> 30:46.660
Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.

30:46.730 --> 30:49.660
The Baron is impatient
for Leto's reply.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.770
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

30:54.830 --> 30:57.300
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

30:57.370 --> 30:59.770
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

30:59.830 --> 31:02.470
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.130
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.430
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

31:10.500 --> 31:12.970
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.370
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.010
My lord.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.010
Piter.

32:23.310 --> 32:25.650
The Atreides will be leaving
Caladan soon, Baron,

32:25.710 --> 32:28.650
and I have here your answer
from Duke Leto.

32:28.710 --> 32:31.510
What does Leto say, Piter?

32:31.580 --> 32:37.220
He wishes to inform you that "vendetta,"
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

32:37.280 --> 32:40.320
the art of Kanly,
is still alive.

32:40.380 --> 32:43.650
He does not wish to meet
or speak with you.

32:45.220 --> 32:48.220
I've made my peace gesture.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.850
The forms of Kanly
have been obeyed!

32:52.750 --> 32:55.390
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.920
As you instructed me,

33:23.990 --> 33:27.490
I have enlightened your nephews
concerning my plan...

33:27.560 --> 33:30.030
My plan!

33:30.090 --> 33:34.630
The plan...
to crush the Atreides.

33:35.790 --> 33:37.760
Feyd.

33:37.830 --> 33:39.760
Rabban.

33:39.830 --> 33:43.130
Go quietly.

33:43.190 --> 33:47.030
No other great house
of the Landsraad...

33:47.090 --> 33:51.490
must ever know of the Emperor's aid
to the Baron.

33:51.560 --> 33:56.030
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron...

33:56.100 --> 33:58.200
and the Emperor.

33:58.260 --> 34:01.300
Put the pick in there, Pete,

34:01.360 --> 34:05.000
and turn it 'round real neat.

34:18.830 --> 34:20.770
Ahhh.

34:25.730 --> 34:29.500
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

34:29.570 --> 34:34.139
Your skin, love to me.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.400
Your diseases,
lovingly cared for...

34:37.469 --> 34:39.940
for all eternity.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.739
I will have Arrakis back for myself.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.840
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

34:52.909 --> 34:55.139
And what Piter
did not tell you...

34:55.210 --> 34:58.470
is we have control
of someone who is very close,

34:58.540 --> 35:01.970
very close to Duke Leto.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.310
This person, this traitor,

35:04.370 --> 35:08.170
will be worth more to us
than ten legions of Sardaukar!

35:08.240 --> 35:11.010
And who is this traitor?

35:11.070 --> 35:13.840
I won't tell you who the traitor is...

35:13.910 --> 35:16.410
or when we'll attack.

35:16.480 --> 35:20.580
However, the duke will die
before these eyes,

35:20.640 --> 35:24.180
and he'll know,
he'll know that it is I,

35:24.240 --> 35:28.210
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

35:37.710 --> 35:39.650
Ha, ha! Ha, ha!

36:45.490 --> 36:49.520
This is what I'll do
to the duke and his family.

37:27.030 --> 37:30.830
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.440
Caladan.

38:49.810 --> 38:53.050
Soon they will begin
to fold space.

38:53.110 --> 38:57.880
Far off
in the control rooms of spice gas...

38:57.950 --> 39:01.480
traveling... without moving.

41:19.240 --> 41:23.370
And now, the prophecy.

41:23.440 --> 41:28.100
One will come.

41:28.170 --> 41:31.910
The voice from the outer world,

41:31.970 --> 41:35.110
bringing the holy war,

41:35.170 --> 41:39.940
the jihad, which will
cleanse the universe...

41:40.010 --> 41:44.140
and bring us
out of darkness.

42:11.050 --> 42:15.350
House Atreides took control
of Arrakis 63 standard days...

42:15.410 --> 42:18.610
into the year 10,191.

42:18.680 --> 42:22.150
It was known that the Harkonnens,
the former rulers of Arrakis,

42:22.250 --> 42:26.380
would leave
many suicide troops behind.

42:26.450 --> 42:28.780
Atreides patrols were doubled.

42:40.620 --> 42:42.780
Duncan.

42:44.950 --> 42:48.250
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

42:48.320 --> 42:51.750
Tell me. Why haven't
we heard from you?

42:51.850 --> 42:55.150
My lord, I suspect so much.

42:56.890 --> 42:59.320
I think they
are the allies we seek.

42:59.390 --> 43:01.320
They are strong, fierce.

43:01.390 --> 43:04.220
They do not give their loyalty
easily or quickly.

43:04.290 --> 43:09.360
As you know, the Imperium has never been
able to take a census of the Fremen.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.860
Everyone thinks that there are but few
wandering here and there in the desert.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.890
My lord,

43:15.960 --> 43:18.990
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet,

43:19.060 --> 43:22.920
that the Fremen exist
in vast numbers...

43:23.860 --> 43:25.990
vast...

43:26.060 --> 43:29.590
and it is they
who control Arrakis.

43:36.990 --> 43:38.860
Each trooper
will be charged with responsibility...

43:38.930 --> 43:40.860
for preserving water.

43:40.930 --> 43:43.260
Our existence
as an operating army...

43:43.330 --> 43:46.060
depends on these following
water-saving procedures.

43:46.130 --> 43:48.930
Remember, water is life.

43:52.530 --> 43:56.330
Why is the shield not yet up?

43:56.400 --> 43:59.730
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.800
I think it'll
go up now, sir.

44:01.860 --> 44:06.670
...armed forces prospects
for rehabilitation are good.

44:06.730 --> 44:09.700
We're finding
these sabotage devices too easily.

44:19.970 --> 44:22.900
House shield activating.

44:30.440 --> 44:35.440
Duke Leto is now here. Spice mining
inspection to start immediately.

44:52.140 --> 44:54.340
So you are Dr. Kynes,

44:54.410 --> 44:56.440
the Judge of the change.

44:56.510 --> 45:00.870
- And the Imperial Ecologist, sire.
- Our intelligence informs us...

45:00.940 --> 45:03.570
that there's still
a strong Harkonnen presence.

45:03.640 --> 45:05.840
The process of removal continues.

45:05.910 --> 45:08.280
This is my son, Paul.

45:10.140 --> 45:12.740
- Are you a Fremen?
- I've been on Arrakis...

45:12.810 --> 45:15.580
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.810
In the service of the Emperor.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.810
We are in your hands, Doctor.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.780
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

45:22.840 --> 45:25.310
Will you give us an explanation
of their workings?

45:25.410 --> 45:29.480
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

45:29.550 --> 45:31.480
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

45:31.550 --> 45:33.910
Basically...

45:36.010 --> 45:38.180
It's all right, Gurney.

45:38.250 --> 45:40.450
Yes, sire.

45:41.510 --> 45:43.480
Basically,

45:43.550 --> 45:47.510
it's a high efficiency
filter and heat exchange system.

45:47.610 --> 45:50.880
Perspiration passes through
the first layer,

45:50.950 --> 45:52.980
and is gathered
in the second,

45:53.050 --> 45:55.380
where salt is separated.

45:55.450 --> 45:59.550
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

45:59.620 --> 46:03.350
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets...

46:03.420 --> 46:06.650
from which you can drink
through this tube...

46:06.720 --> 46:08.750
at your neck.

46:08.820 --> 46:12.450
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.950
Should you be
in the open desert,

46:16.020 --> 46:18.350
remember to breathe in
through your mouth...

46:18.420 --> 46:20.990
and out through
this nose tube.

46:21.050 --> 46:23.750
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

46:23.820 --> 46:26.050
life can be sustained
for weeks,

46:26.120 --> 46:30.260
even in the deep desert, sire.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.260
My thanks.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.260
With your permission.

46:36.760 --> 46:40.220
- You've worn a stillsuit before.
- No.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.060
Your suit is fitted
desert fashion.

46:43.120 --> 46:46.590
- Who told you how to do that?
- No one.

46:46.690 --> 46:48.630
It seemed the proper way.

46:51.490 --> 46:53.890
That it is.

46:53.960 --> 46:59.030
He shall know your ways
as if born to them.

46:59.090 --> 47:01.690
We're wasting time, sire.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.430
Battle language?
Translate it.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.700
Very faint.

47:30.070 --> 47:32.270
Harkonnen!

47:37.430 --> 47:40.130
Airspeed: Zero five.

47:40.200 --> 47:44.400
Ambient temperature:
300 degrees kelvin.

47:44.470 --> 47:46.430
Airspeed: Three zero.

47:51.100 --> 47:53.300
...75%% % efficiency.

47:59.440 --> 48:02.900
That's where I told your sandmaster
to concentrate the harvesting today.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.210
Southeast, over the shield wall.

48:08.240 --> 48:13.370
Ambient temperature: 350 degrees kelvin.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.810
Airspeed: One three zero.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.010
Caution: You've now cleared
protective shield wall...

48:21.070 --> 48:23.670
and entered open desert.

48:31.910 --> 48:34.240
Will we see a worm?

48:34.310 --> 48:38.240
Where there's spice and spice mining,
there are always worms.

48:38.340 --> 48:41.210
- Always.
- Always.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.240
Why do they come?

48:43.310 --> 48:45.780
To protect their territory.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.110
Vibrations attract them.

48:48.180 --> 48:50.310
He must be a Fremen,

48:50.380 --> 48:52.310
or in with them.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.310
He's studying us.

48:54.380 --> 48:56.950
He's hiding something
about the spice.

48:57.010 --> 48:59.480
Is there a relationship
between the worms and the spice?

49:01.750 --> 49:06.610
As I said,
they defend the spice sand.

49:06.680 --> 49:10.620
As to their relationship
with the spice,

49:10.680 --> 49:12.650
who knows?

49:28.450 --> 49:30.390
My message. It's here.

49:34.590 --> 49:39.850
There are more enemy bodies coming in
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

49:44.120 --> 49:48.160
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

49:48.220 --> 49:50.660
Thank you, Thufir.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.690
- Dust cloud ahead, sire.
- That's it. Spice mining.

49:57.790 --> 50:01.220
No other cloud quite like it.

50:04.360 --> 50:07.590
Wormsign. Is it wormsign?

50:07.660 --> 50:10.230
Yes. Worm. Big one.

50:10.330 --> 50:12.730
You've got sharp eyes.
May I?

50:16.290 --> 50:19.230
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

50:19.290 --> 50:21.260
Who calls Pad Nine?

50:21.360 --> 50:24.390
Don't mention the duke.
This is an uncoded channel.

50:24.490 --> 50:29.030
Unlisted flight northeast of you.
Wormsign on intercept course.

50:29.130 --> 50:32.060
Estimated contact: 15 minutes.

50:32.130 --> 50:34.660
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for fix.

50:34.760 --> 50:37.430
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

50:37.530 --> 50:40.800
Very precise estimate.
Who's on that unlisted flight?

50:43.400 --> 50:49.200
- What happens now?
- The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester.

50:49.270 --> 50:51.770
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

50:51.870 --> 50:56.630
You'll find this interesting, sire.
They'll work until the very last minute.

50:56.700 --> 50:59.230
Spotter control,
there's no sign of the carryall.

50:59.330 --> 51:01.270
It isn't answering.

51:01.330 --> 51:04.300
The worm is eight minutes away, sire.

51:04.370 --> 51:06.800
Spotter control,
give me a report by the numbers.

51:06.870 --> 51:09.540
- Report One.
- No contact.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.600
- Report Two.
- Negative.

51:11.700 --> 51:13.840
- Report Three.
- Negative, sir.

51:13.940 --> 51:17.570
- Report Four.
- No contact.

51:17.670 --> 51:19.600
I think they've got
our carryall.

51:19.670 --> 51:21.800
Damn it.
Harkonnens.

51:21.900 --> 51:26.610
We are coming down to take you off the
harvester. All spotters are ordered to comply.

51:26.670 --> 51:29.170
- Ordered by whom?
- Duke Leto Atreides.

51:29.270 --> 51:32.770
- Yes. Yes, sire.
- How many men do you have?

51:32.870 --> 51:34.910
Full crew, 26 men.

51:35.010 --> 51:37.310
But, sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

51:37.370 --> 51:39.910
Damn the spice!
Get out of there!

51:49.480 --> 51:52.140
Two men in each of the spoilers!

51:52.240 --> 51:57.040
You, over here! Run! Run!

52:02.010 --> 52:04.610
I can't see him yet,
but he's very close.

52:04.710 --> 52:08.310
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

52:08.410 --> 52:10.350
Come on, boys, come on!

52:13.550 --> 52:15.510
We're going to be heavy, sire.

52:15.580 --> 52:18.550
Spice.

52:18.610 --> 52:22.250
Pure, unrefined spice.

52:28.420 --> 52:30.820
Here it is! We've got to go!

52:40.050 --> 52:43.950
Bless the maker and his water.
Bless the coming and going of him.

52:44.020 --> 52:47.790
- May his passing cleanse the world.
- What's that you're saying?

52:47.850 --> 52:49.790
Nothing.

53:25.620 --> 53:27.760
Gods, what a monster!

53:36.530 --> 53:40.190
Someone is going to pay for this,
I promise.

53:43.090 --> 53:46.660
He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.

53:46.760 --> 53:51.260
I must admit,
against all better judgment,

53:51.360 --> 53:53.500
I like this duke.

54:39.040 --> 54:42.110
Milady, the local people,

54:42.210 --> 54:45.040
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

54:45.100 --> 54:48.110
Hawat has cleared them.

54:51.010 --> 54:53.340
Excuse me, milady.

54:53.410 --> 54:57.770
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.710
When you said Harkonnens,

55:10.610 --> 55:13.280
I didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

55:17.010 --> 55:19.010
My wife...

55:20.610 --> 55:24.150
But of course, you didn't know my wife.

55:25.310 --> 55:27.280
The Hark...

55:27.380 --> 55:29.450
Forgive me.

55:29.550 --> 55:31.480
They must have killed her.

55:31.550 --> 55:35.980
Please excuse me
if I can't talk about it.

55:39.350 --> 55:41.880
He's holding something back.

55:41.980 --> 55:43.920
Yet...

55:43.980 --> 55:47.250
There's the Imperial Conditioning.

55:48.580 --> 55:50.520
Assurance of trust.

55:57.120 --> 56:01.020
The Bene Gesserit mother. The legend.

56:01.080 --> 56:04.090
Where is your son?

56:04.190 --> 56:08.020
I must warn you,
you are in great danger.

56:10.750 --> 56:12.690
Safe.

56:28.860 --> 56:30.920
Spice.

56:48.330 --> 56:50.260
What is it doing to me?

57:02.760 --> 57:04.700
Second moon.

57:06.200 --> 57:08.130
The sleeper must awaken.

57:09.060 --> 57:11.060
Am I the one?

57:24.330 --> 57:26.800
A hunter seeker.

57:26.870 --> 57:28.830
Can't get me if I don't move.

57:30.030 --> 57:33.630
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

57:48.970 --> 57:51.740
I've got to try to grab it.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.440
Suspensor field will make it
slippery on the bottom.

57:54.540 --> 57:58.370
I must grip it tightly.

57:58.440 --> 58:01.200
Who is operating that thing?

58:01.270 --> 58:05.210
It has to be someone
in the palace.

58:05.310 --> 58:09.570
I could shout for help, but it would
kill whoever opened the door.

58:26.340 --> 58:30.010
Hold still.

58:52.010 --> 58:55.950
It would have killed me.

58:56.010 --> 59:00.050
I was its target.
It went to the motion.

59:00.150 --> 59:02.220
Who are you?

59:02.320 --> 59:06.850
I am the Shadout Mapes,
the housekeeper.

59:06.950 --> 59:10.780
I must cleanse
the way between us.

59:10.850 --> 59:15.480
You saved my life,
and we Fremen pay our debts.

59:15.580 --> 59:17.780
A Fremen.

59:17.850 --> 59:21.620
It is known to us that you've
a traitor in your midst.

59:21.690 --> 59:24.150
Who it is, we cannot say.

59:24.220 --> 59:27.290
But we are certain of it.

59:36.620 --> 59:38.560
A traitor.

59:38.620 --> 59:42.150
Let's go, guys!

59:49.290 --> 59:52.860
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

59:52.960 --> 59:56.360
Over here!

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.790
Harkonnen.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:09.230
They have tried
to take the life of my son.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.160
Sector six through 80,
progress reports, sire.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.690
Take it, Thufir.

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:22.930
Sector six, 80, copy the sixth,
the sum of the eighth,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.360
the quadrant over the ninth, plus 80, four
circles, weave the 80 and call the fourth.

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:28.860
Copy.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.930
Eight, Thufir Hawat,
Mentat, Master of Assassins.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:42.630
The, uh, the palace
is now secure.

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:46.500
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:51.270
We have troops here,
headquartered underground,

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:53.500
on subfloors six through ten.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.300
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.800
and we have some
on the airfield.

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:01.270
Our new army
is still in training,

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.840
but everything,
everything is shielded,

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.740
and with this shielding,
we are impenetrable.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.710
Sleep well, my son.

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:18.980
Father... drugged.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.220
Jessica, what is wrong?

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.550
Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.320
I should have married you.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.950
Why hold a dream to ascend to a throne
through a political marriage?

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:43.790
I should have married you.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.690
What happened?

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.190
Yueh!

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:37.430
He sabotaged the house generators.
We are wide open!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.460
House shield deactivating.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.130
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:50.060
I've brought
House Atreides down.

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.730
- Why?
- I wish to kill a man.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:57.770
Not you, my dear Duke.
You were already dead.

01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.960
But you'll get close
to the baron before you die.

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.600
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.130
You can still attack!

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.030
When you see the baron,

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.670
you'll have
a new poison gas tooth.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:17.700
He'll want you close
so he can gloat over you.

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:20.730
One bite on this tooth,

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.170
and a strong exhale...

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.540
- Refuse.
- No, you mustn't!

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:32.040
Because, in return, I'll save
the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.370
For Paul.

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.870
Oh!

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:57.810
When you see the baron,
remember the tooth.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.610
The tooth. The tooth!

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.640
- The shield is down!
The shield is down!

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.110
Open the doors!

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.180
Signals!

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.350
- Get that shield up!
- The shield! The shield!

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.550
The weirding modules. Destroyed!

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.560
Long live Duke Leto!

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:01.800
The drug was timed.

01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:07.930
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.330
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.330
We can't let ourselves be swayed
by your witch's voice now, can we?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.670
Leto, where are you?

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:26.970
How simple to subdue us.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.740
Good-bye, Jessica.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.800
And good-bye
to your sweet son.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.800
I want to spit once on your head.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:52.100
Just some spittle in your face.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.340
What a luxury.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:05.470
We were ordered
to kill them, so kill them.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.140
I wish this was Paul.

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:21.310
I knew Yueh's wife.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:27.040
I was the one who broke
his Imperial Conditioning.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.979
I've thought of many pleasures
with you.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:41.550
It is perhaps better that you die
in the innards of a worm.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.550
What are your orders, Piter?

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:58.550
Take them to the desert
as the traitor suggested.

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:01.580
The worms will destroy the evidence.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.580
Their bodies must never be found.

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.350
They're down on this floor somewhere.
Down there.

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.620
Duncan!

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:48.790
Yaaah!

01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:52.290
Yaaaah!

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:56.890
You wish now to join your wife?
Is that it, traitor?

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:58.920
She lives?

01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:01.860
You wish to join her?

01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:06.930
Join her.

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:17.090
You think you've defeated me?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.600
You think I don't know what
I gained... for my wife?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.900
Take him away.

01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:56.940
Yueh's sign.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.500
He's left us stillsuits.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.140
Don't touch my mother!

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.140
He's trying the Voice.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.170
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.240
Did you hear a noise
from the little one?

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:23.710
Huh? I didn't hear anything.

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:29.070
The little one.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.480
Remove her gag.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.610
Excellent.

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:54.210
Remove her gag.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.480
There's no need to fight over me.

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:08.380
There's no need to fight...

01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:17.820
A poisoned blade.

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:31.380
First... cut my son's bonds.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:41.850
That's it.

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:55.720
Oh, my God!

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.490
It's under control.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:40.060
Duke Leto Atreides.

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:47.400
Where is the ducal signet ring?

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:50.700
I must have his ring.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.400
The ring!

01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:00.000
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:06.200
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:10.570
The doctor, Yueh. What did he say?

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:15.170
Paul and Jessica safe.
Yes! The tooth!

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.640
He's coming around, Baron.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.470
Where's your ring?

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:23.800
Huh? You do not answer?

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:26.140
Wait. Wait.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.240
You must come closer.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.970
The water...

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.810
of my life...

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:37.140
for Paul.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.410
He's crying. He's crying!

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:44.440
What does that mean, Piter?

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:50.410
Come closer, Baron.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.080
Jessica! Paul!

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.340
Leto! Leto, he's dead!

01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:08.710
Oh, he's dead!

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.840
I know.

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:20.410
Am I alive?

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.550
- I'm alive?
- Yes.

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.810
You're alive, my Baron.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.380
I'm alive, eh?

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:34.280
I'm alive!
I am alive!

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:38.050
I'm alive!

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.080
I can't maintain any altitude.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:50.580
We'll never reach
the safety of rock.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:56.020
Maybe that small rock.

01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.220
Where are we,
do you think?

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:02.390
The south polar regions.
The forbidden area.

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:05.250
Hold on.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.050
Hurry!

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.390
Take the stillsuits.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.420
Hurry! This crash
might bring a worm.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.060
The signet.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.420
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.060
Where are my feelings?
I feel for no one.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.960
The second moon.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:26.500
I mean Paul Atreides.

01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:29.070
We want him killed.

01:17:29.130 --> 01:17:33.370
Why? Why do they want me killed?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.440
It has to be something
to do with the spice.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.540
But what?

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.200
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:00.040
This moon holds my future.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:16.340
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.380
The sleeper must awaken.

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:36.210
They will call me Muad'Dib.

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:46.750
Listen to me. Listen.

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:49.810
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.680
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.520
Do you know why?

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:59.680
The spice!
It's in everything here.

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:01.880
Calm yourself.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:07.020
Like the Truthsayer drug.
It's a poison.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.020
You knew the spice
would change me.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.550
But thanks to your teachings,
it's changing my consciousness.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:18.350
I see it!
I can see it!

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.050
Is he the one?

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.890
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.490
He knows.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.460
Father!

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.960
Father, I promise one day
the sleeper will awaken,

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:52.860
and I will avenge your death.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:58.760
I will not stop until I destroy
the emperor and the baron.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:05.760
Father.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.430
Go now.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.660
Take him to his desert...
to die.

01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:31.770
Go.

01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:06.370
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:20.810
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:25.270
We have entered the time when all
will turn against us and seek our lives.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.640
It's further than I thought.

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.340
A worm is sure to come.

01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:52.650
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:23.820
Remember, walk without rhythm,

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.780
and we won't attract a worm.

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:28.120
It will go to the thumper.

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:31.680
I'm ready.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.690
Faster!

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:18.060
It's deafening!

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:36.070
The spice.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.870
- Do you smell it?
- Yes!

01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:50.840
Paul!

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.780
Paul!

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.280
A thumper.

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:33.150
The worm! Spice!
Is there a relationship?

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.580
What's happened?

01:25:48.650 --> 01:25:51.650
Why did it leave?

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.250
Someone started
another thumper.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.350
We're not alone.

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.360
Man-carved steps.

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:32.360
Yes.

01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:47.530
Such stealth.

01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:49.560
I didn't hear them.

01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:53.000
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.530
I will take the boy-man.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.560
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.630
Stop! Get back!

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.130
She has the weirding way.

01:27:13.570 --> 01:27:15.670
Great gods!

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.630
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.670
you're worth ten times
your weight of water.

01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:28.330
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.070
Teach us this weirding way,

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.640
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.140
Your water shall mingle
with our water.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.140
Then I will teach you
our way of battle.

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:49.240
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:51.470
It is the legend.

01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:00.970
I am Chani,
daughter of Liet.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.670
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:11.410
From my dreams. So beautiful.

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:14.810
Come with me.
I'll show you an easier way down.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.250
You have strength.

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:38.880
You shall be known as Usul,

01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:41.680
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.780
This is your secret name
in our troop,

01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:48.150
but you must choose
the name of manhood...

01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:51.420
which we will call you openly.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.050
What do you call the mouse shadow
in the second moon?

01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:02.950
We call that one Muad'Dib.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:06.380
Could I be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:10.090
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:14.590
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:17.450
We welcome you.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.920
A dream unfolds.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.590
Moisture!

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.620
Wind traps.
Huge ones.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.890
Water.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.790
Millions of decaliters.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.290
A treasure.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.090
Greater than treasure, Usul.

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:10.660
We have thousands
of such caches,

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:14.930
and only a few of us
know them all.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.930
And when we have enough,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.860
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.630
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:49.540
"Tell me of your home world, Usul. "

01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:29.610
Rabban! Rabban!

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:35.710
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood.
We've gutted them!

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:39.640
We've gutted them!

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.810
Rabban. Rabban!

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.310
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.310
It's yours to squeeze
as I promised.

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.650
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:58.810
Give me spice!

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.980
Drive them! Drive them
into utter submission!

01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:05.280
Do not show the slightest pity
or mercy!

01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:09.320
Never stop! Go! Go!
Show no mercy!

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.780
Yes, Baron.

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.250
Feyd.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:47.760
And when
we've crushed these people enough,

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.160
I'll send you, Feyd.

01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:58.360
Lovely Feyd.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.620
Where's my doctor?

01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:16.690
Jessica...

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.160
our Reverend Mother is too old.

01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:23.330
She has been calling
through space and time...

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:27.030
for you to come
and let her rest.

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:32.730
She asks that you pass within
and become our Reverend Mother.

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:38.400
If you be a Reverend Mother...

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.730
let Shai-Halud judge now!

01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:49.870
The Water of Life.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.970
But what of my unborn child?

01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:00.530
One day, I will have to do this.

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:20.270
Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:22.840
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life...

01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.940
as she surrendered her knowledge.

01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:31.270
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:35.870
Every man who has tried has died.

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.940
Am I the one?

01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:42.310
The sleeper must awaken.

01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:48.270
The tremendous power
of the Water of Life...

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.880
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.440
Alia was born with all the knowledge
and powers of a Reverend Mother.

01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.580
Feyd, even though he's aging,

01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:18.550
Thufir's one of the finest Mentats
in the universe.

01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:23.010
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:29.020
- Try it now.
- I will.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.020
Come.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.050
Oh, Thufir!

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:49.720
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:54.050
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.390
But this is not
why we're here.

01:35:57.450 --> 01:36:00.550
We brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.550
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:09.660
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:13.490
By milking this,
this smooth little cat's body,

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.820
you receive your antidote.

01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:17.990
It must be done each day.

01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:23.320
All I can see...

01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:26.520
is an Atreides
that I want to kill.

01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:30.490
Feyd! No, no!

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.660
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.
Aren't you, Thufir?

01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:39.930
My duke! How I've failed you.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:01.730
Chani, I love you.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.460
I've always loved you.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:31.940
The Holy Warriors.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.500
No one ever dreamed
there were so many.

01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:40.670
I am Usul.
Paul Muad'Dib.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.100
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

01:37:47.170 --> 01:37:50.610
are once again
in control of Arrakis.

01:37:50.670 --> 01:37:54.940
Stilgar, your leader,
has asked me and my mother...

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:59.440
to teach you the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

01:37:59.510 --> 01:38:02.270
We must do more than this.

01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:06.310
We must totally destroy
all spice production on Arrakis.

01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:12.110
The Guild and the entire universe
depends on spice.

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.140
He who can destroy a thing
controls a thing.

01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:20.310
I will take 100 of your warriors
and train them.

01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:24.410
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:29.950
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:32.350
The baron
and the emperor himself...

01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:34.910
will be forced to deal with us.

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:42.080
Arrakis will become
the center of the universe.

01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:46.250
Orato!

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:53.950
This obelisk
is of your hardest stone.

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:56.180
Kick it.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.450
Hit it.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.550
Yell at it.

01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:17.620
Break!

01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:22.790
Korba... cut it.

01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:37.720
Move back.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:58.460
Cha-a-a-a...

01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:00.260
a- aksa!

01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:05.230
Muad'Dib!

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:09.960
This is part of the weirding way
that we will teach you.

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:15.960
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:18.760
that being the equivalent
to a form.

01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:22.000
Through sound and motion...

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:26.100
you will be able to paralyze nerves,
shatter bones,

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.570
set fires, suffocate an enemy
or burst his organs.

01:40:30.630 --> 01:40:35.530
We will kill until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.030
Muad'Dib!

01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:43.600
Cha-a-a-a-aksa!

01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:50.770
Stilgar!

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.440
- Muad'Dib!
- Hmm?

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.740
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.870
My name is a killing word.

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:07.340
They are ready to fight.

01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:11.070
Yet in order to lead them,
I must conquer the worm.

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.810
Conquer Shai-Halud.

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:25.280
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch...

01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:28.280
and ride as a leader of men.

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:46.510
Mmmmmm. Shai-Halud.

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:30.650
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:41.590
Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.

01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:45.020
Usul has called a big one!

01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:48.020
Again, it is the legend.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.140
Look!

01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:28.610
Muad'Dib!

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.440
Usul, these are 15
of our finest warriors...

01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:08.080
to serve you as your guard.

01:45:12.610 --> 01:45:14.850
The Fedaykin.

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.050
Cha-aksa!

01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:27.950
Ooh!

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.950
Now.

01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:36.880
Cha-a-aksa!

01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:43.220
Cha-aksa! Cha-aksa!

01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:47.390
Cha-aksa! Cha-aksa!

01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:49.850
Aaaah!

01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:54.420
Cha-aksa!

01:45:54.490 --> 01:45:59.050
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.560
The baron and the emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:11.620
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

01:46:11.690 --> 01:46:15.520
What happened?
What happened to you and your men?

01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:18.820
- Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
- What are you saying?

01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:21.320
- Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
- What?

01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:26.360
He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.

01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:31.930
Who is this... Muad'Dib?

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:37.660
Cha-aksa!

01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:41.330
In the two standard years that followed,

01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:45.500
Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:48.600
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best...

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.330
to hide this fact
from his uncle, the baron.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.100
Paul's sister, Alia,
matured at a frightening rate.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.500
Her small body
harbored tremendous powers.

01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:08.870
Paul and Chani's love grew.

01:47:14.170 --> 01:47:16.430
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:20.070
Too bad.
I thought they were Harkonnen.

01:47:20.130 --> 01:47:22.130
Cha-aksa!

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.270
Cha-a-aksa!

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.370
Gurney!

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:38.600
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:42.270
Paul? Paul?

01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.440
Don't you trust
your own eyes?

01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:46.940
They said you were dead.

01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:51.940
They... they said...

01:47:55.570 --> 01:47:58.540
Gurney! Gurney man!

01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:01.880
- You young pup! You young pup!
- Gurney!

01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:21.180
Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.410
you have one last chance
to take matters into your own hands...

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.650
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:31.510
- What do you mean one last...
- Silence! Do not speak!

01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.310
Listen! You do not have
more than this one chance.

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.310
I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.880
Our navigators warn you that
spice production is in great danger.

01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:46.780
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,
has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.

01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:50.780
Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:54.050
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.080
We do not know who he is.

01:48:56.150 --> 01:48:58.650
The Harkonnens
cannot stop him.

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.450
Remedy the situation,
restore spice production,

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.590
or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.

01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:18.250
The emperor will stop him.
He won't take the Water of Life.

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.760
That's why they want me killed.

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.390
They're afraid I'll take
the Water of Life.

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.420
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

01:49:27.490 --> 01:49:31.160
Fifty legions?
That's our entire reserves as well.

01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:34.520
This is genocide: The deliberate
and systematic destruction...

01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:37.660
of all life on Arrakis!

01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:42.220
The emperor is coming. Chani! Chani!

01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:49.030
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

01:49:49.130 --> 01:49:51.760
Oh, Chani.

01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.430
All the images
of my future are gone.

01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.590
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

01:49:59.690 --> 01:50:02.430
No. Paul. Please.

01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:04.460
I've seen the men
who have tried.

01:50:04.530 --> 01:50:06.500
I've seen how they died.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.500
I'm dead to everyone
unless I try...

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.930
to become what I may be.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.630
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

01:50:16.730 --> 01:50:18.660
Paul.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:25.230
I must drink the sacred water.

01:50:27.630 --> 01:50:30.070
We must go now.

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.780
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.810
Paul,

01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:33.640
I will love you forever.

01:51:33.710 --> 01:51:37.240
You are my life.

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.410
You are my life.

01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:57.010
Many men have tried.

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:59.080
They tried and failed?

01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:01.080
They tried and died.

01:52:09.650 --> 01:52:14.250
The worm is the spice.
The spice is the worm.

01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:35.720
The worms.

01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:54.720
They're not attacking. Why?

01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:17.260
- Alia.
- Mother.

01:53:19.690 --> 01:53:21.660
It's Paul.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:28.000
He's taken the Water of Life.

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:38.860
There is a place...

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.330
terrifying to us, to women.

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.430
This is the place they cannot look.

01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:56.100
Travelling without moving.

01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.870
Now I truly control the worm...

01:54:00.930 --> 01:54:04.200
and the spice.

01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:09.400
And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:39.870
Paul.

01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:54.240
Father!

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:01.980
Father, the sleeper has awakened!

01:55:04.650 --> 01:55:10.250
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:15.980
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.050
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:22.850
Arrakis.

01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:26.780
Dune. Desert planet.

01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:30.920
Your time has come.

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.650
A storm is coming.

01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:36.320
Our storm.

01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:41.280
And when it arrives
it will shake the universe.

01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:46.790
Emperor, we come for you!

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.350
We come for you!

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:07.390
Long live the fighters!

01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:11.860
Long live the fighters!

01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:47.500
Suspicion confirmed:
The emperor's had Rabban seized.

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:31.670
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

01:57:33.170 --> 01:57:37.570
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.740
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

01:57:42.970 --> 01:57:47.840
Usul, we have wormsign the likes
of which even God has never seen.

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:46.620
Bring in that
floating fat man,

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:49.380
the baron.

01:59:03.690 --> 01:59:05.650
Why have you brought me here?

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:08.350
Your Highness...

01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:10.350
there must be some mistake.

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:13.220
- I never requested your presence.
- Ah.

01:59:13.290 --> 01:59:15.920
But your lack of action
demanded it.

01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:18.490
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment...

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:22.060
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:25.720
You've forced me to come here
and set things straight, personally!

01:59:35.190 --> 01:59:40.130
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

01:59:40.190 --> 01:59:42.760
Poor Emperor!

01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:46.030
I'm afraid my brother
won't be very pleased with you.

01:59:46.090 --> 01:59:50.130
- Silence!
- Kill this child. She's an abomination.

01:59:50.190 --> 01:59:52.630
Kill her!

01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:55.330
Get out of my mind!

01:59:55.390 --> 02:00:01.030
Not until you
tell them both who I really am.

02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:04.030
Alia.

02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:09.730
Daughter of
Duke Leto the Just...

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:13.530
and the Royal Lady Jessica.

02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:19.330
Sister of Paul Muad'Dib.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.330
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

02:00:27.970 --> 02:00:30.500
Alia keeps pace
with the storm.

02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:38.300
With the storm,
their air power will be useless.

02:00:38.370 --> 02:00:41.470
On Arrakis,
it's desert power.

02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:44.770
Gurney,

02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:45.840
now!

02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:48.200
Atomics!

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:24.310
My brother is coming...

02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:27.580
with many Fremen warriors.

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:30.380
Impossible!

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.380
Not impossible!

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.310
I told you.
He is here now.

02:01:42.710 --> 02:01:45.750
Father, today I will avenge your death.

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:13.020
Emperor, an impassable storm
has descended.

02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:16.180
The shield wall
has been penetrated by atomics.

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:19.850
Release the Sardaukar!

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:24.890
Baron, give this
little abomination to the storm.

02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:27.650
Wait for my brother, Baron.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:16.030
Cha-aksa!

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.610
Wait for my brother.

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:27.270
Cha-aksa!

02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:32.540
Muad'Dib!

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.280
Cha-aksa!

02:05:12.610 --> 02:05:14.550
Cha-aksa!

02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:18.850
Cha-aksa!

02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:29.350
Alia, now.

02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:31.520
Come to me, Baron.

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:49.260
Muad'Dib.

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.840
Feyd Rautha.

02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:37.140
Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:39.410
there are Guild heighliners
above us...

02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:41.610
containing many great
Houses of the Landsraad.

02:07:41.670 --> 02:07:45.140
- Send them back!
- How dare you speak to me in that...

02:07:45.210 --> 02:07:47.710
Stop your speaking!

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:52.040
You have some idea
of what I could do.

02:07:54.170 --> 02:07:57.610
Don't try your powers on me.

02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:00.680
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:02.740
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:04.940
- You mustn't speak...
- Silence!

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:11.780
I remember your gom jabbar.

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:15.410
Now you remember mine.
I can kill with a word.

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.550
Aaaah! Aaaah!

02:08:17.610 --> 02:08:21.280
And his word
shall carry death eternal...

02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.450
to those who stand
against the righteous.

02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:26.950
- The righteous?
- There is a Harkonnen among you.

02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:31.510
Give the Harkonnen a blade,

02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:33.510
and let him stand forth.

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:37.220
If Feyd wishes, he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:41.220
- I wish it.
- This is a Harkonnen animal.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:43.880
Let me.
Please, my lord.

02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:46.450
The Emperor's blade.

02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:19.220
Why prolong the inevitable?

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.920
I will kill you!

02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:41.630
I will kill him!

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.430
Paul!

02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:52.390
I will kill him!

02:10:01.330 --> 02:10:03.830
Who is the little one?

02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:06.300
A pet, perhaps?

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:08.730
Will she deserve
my special attentions?

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:18.530
Poisoned.

02:10:20.370 --> 02:10:23.870
You see your death.

02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:26.670
My blade will finish you.

02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:33.070
I will bend like a reed in the wind.

02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:37.200
Aaaaah!

02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:50.400
Cha-aksa!

02:10:56.110 --> 02:10:57.640
Muad'Dib!

02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:00.810
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:05.540
Muad'Dib had become the hand of God,

02:11:05.610 --> 02:11:08.410
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:11.910
Where there was war,
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

02:11:11.970 --> 02:11:16.380
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.180
to lead the people
to true freedom,

02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:22.110
and to change
the face of Arrakis.

02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:27.840
We Fremen have a saying.

02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:32.840
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:36.050
One cannot go against
the word of God.

02:12:33.790 --> 02:12:36.560
And how can this be?

02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:41.520
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
