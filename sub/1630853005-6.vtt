41:48.593 --> 41:50.595
So great was his need.

41:55.295 --> 41:57.471
[crying]

42:06.567 --> 42:08.482
Is she mad?

42:08.613 --> 42:11.398
-She's not mad.
-[Jamie] A clever liar then.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.401
Clever enough to ken no one
would believe her tale of rape.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.751
Oh, no, sir. Never.

42:16.882 --> 42:20.276
I should never say
such a thing of you, never!

42:20.407 --> 42:22.278
You needed comfort.
I gave it to you.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.237
She's with a child by someone,
and not by me.

42:24.367 --> 42:25.543
Who might it have been?

42:25.673 --> 42:26.500
[Malva] It was you.

42:26.631 --> 42:27.893
There's no one else!

42:28.023 --> 42:29.590
[Tom] I know of no one.

42:29.721 --> 42:33.159
She says it wasn't
only the once,

42:33.289 --> 42:35.814
but the man in question
had her a dozen times or more.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.903
And she has lied
a dozen times or more.

42:38.033 --> 42:39.034
Your wife believes me.

42:39.165 --> 42:41.602
My wife has better sense.

42:41.733 --> 42:44.344
I've seen the scars
on your naked body.

42:44.474 --> 42:45.824
I can describe them.

42:47.739 --> 42:50.176
No answer to that,

42:50.263 --> 42:52.831
have you?

42:52.961 --> 42:54.876
There are a number of people
who have seen my back,

42:55.007 --> 42:56.791
including you, Tom.

42:56.922 --> 42:58.750
I havena slept
with them, either.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.361
But what of the crescent mark
across your ribs?

43:01.491 --> 43:03.842
Or the great ugly one high
on your leg on the inside?

43:05.800 --> 43:07.715
[Allan] Show us she's wrong.

43:07.846 --> 43:09.499
Lower your breeks
and give us a look, then.

43:14.330 --> 43:15.723
[Tom]
So I suppose you don't intend

43:15.854 --> 43:18.160
to put aside your wife
and marry her

43:18.247 --> 43:21.033
since you are already married
in the eyes of God?

43:21.120 --> 43:22.730
Of course not.

43:22.861 --> 43:24.645
[Tom]
Then we'll draw up a contract.

43:24.776 --> 43:27.953
Maintenance for her
and the bairn.

43:28.083 --> 43:29.911
Formal acknowledgement
of the child's rights

43:30.042 --> 43:31.217
as one of your heirs.

43:35.264 --> 43:36.831
I suppose you could take
the bastard

43:36.962 --> 43:38.659
for your wife to rear.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.053
-That is your business.
-Get out.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.753
Take your daughter

43:45.884 --> 43:46.798
-and leave my house.
-[Malva crying]

43:56.721 --> 44:00.420
[Malva sobbing]

44:00.550 --> 44:01.290
I'd like nothing better
than to give you

44:01.377 --> 44:02.640
your head in yer hands.

44:05.512 --> 44:08.689
Leave now, before I do it.

44:28.056 --> 44:29.405
[Jamie] I've been wondering,
Sassenach,

44:29.536 --> 44:32.104
what in God's name
I should say.

44:32.234 --> 44:33.845
I thought of
one thing and another--

44:33.975 --> 44:35.498
Hell, I could think
of a few things.

44:35.585 --> 44:36.499
[Jamie] What?

44:36.586 --> 44:38.284
Say I was sorry?

44:38.414 --> 44:40.242
That's no' right.

44:41.374 --> 44:43.985
I am sorry but to say so
sounds as though I've done

44:44.116 --> 44:46.118
something to be sorry for,
and I have not.

44:46.248 --> 44:47.772
There is no way
to deny such a charge

44:47.902 --> 44:50.339
without carrying a stink
of doubt about it.

44:50.426 --> 44:52.690
And nothing I can say to you
that doesna sound

44:52.820 --> 44:55.170
like a groveling apology.

44:55.301 --> 44:57.999
I willna apologize
for somethin' I havena done.

44:58.130 --> 44:59.914
If I did,

45:00.045 --> 45:02.090
you'd only doubt me more.

45:02.221 --> 45:03.352
Well, you don't seem to have
a lot of faith

45:03.483 --> 45:06.007
of my faith in you.

45:06.138 --> 45:08.357
If I didna have quite
a lot of it, I wouldna be here.

45:12.361 --> 45:14.494
Ye didna think it true?

45:14.624 --> 45:17.497
What Malva said.

45:17.627 --> 45:19.238
You ran away.

45:19.368 --> 45:22.067
'Cause I was in shock.

45:22.154 --> 45:24.591
And if I'd stayed, I might
have bloody well killed her.

45:26.854 --> 45:28.595
Ye didna think it true,
though?

45:30.858 --> 45:32.425
I saw you
at the window with her.

45:35.907 --> 45:37.473
How she touched you.

45:41.651 --> 45:43.653
I had thought it was
an hallucination, but...

45:46.004 --> 45:47.701
Jamie Fraser...

45:50.660 --> 45:54.055
...if you could do
such a thing as that--

45:54.186 --> 45:58.581
and-and I don't mean
lying with a woman.

45:58.712 --> 46:01.410
I mean, doing it and then lying
to me about it...

46:04.979 --> 46:07.677
Well then everything I've done
and everything that we have

46:07.808 --> 46:09.331
is a lie.

46:12.726 --> 46:16.686
And I'm not prepared
to-to admit to such a thing.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.732
What do you mean
by that, Sassenach?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.478
I don't belong here.

46:28.046 --> 46:31.266
Brianna, Roger,
they don't belong here.

46:31.353 --> 46:33.878
And Jemmy,
shouldn't be here.

46:34.966 --> 46:38.839
But yet-but yet
here we all are, all of us.

46:38.970 --> 46:42.277
Because I loved you
more than the life that I had.

46:46.020 --> 46:48.414
And because I believed that
you loved me in the same way.

46:50.764 --> 46:52.374
'Cause you do.

46:54.507 --> 46:56.248
And I-I know that.

46:58.685 --> 47:01.035
Or are you going tell me
that that's not truth?

47:01.122 --> 47:02.384
No.

47:04.299 --> 47:06.867
I willna tell ye that.

47:06.954 --> 47:08.042
Not ever.

47:12.438 --> 47:13.569
Claire...

47:16.529 --> 47:18.270
I do have something
to tell you.

47:20.663 --> 47:22.535
Don't do that.

47:26.800 --> 47:30.848
It feels like a punch
to the gut.

47:30.978 --> 47:33.154
I'm sorry.

47:33.285 --> 47:35.504
You said you wouldn't
say you were sorry

47:35.591 --> 47:39.291
unless you'd-you'd done
something you were sorry for.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.902
I did.

47:44.905 --> 47:49.214
There is no good way to

47:49.344 --> 47:52.130
tell your wife you've lain
with someone else

47:52.260 --> 47:54.001
no matter the circumstances.

47:57.744 --> 47:59.659
Who?

47:59.746 --> 48:01.400
And when?

48:02.967 --> 48:05.056
When you...

48:05.143 --> 48:08.189
you were gone.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.582
Only once.

48:10.931 --> 48:12.454
When I was gone?

48:16.589 --> 48:18.025
Who?

48:19.505 --> 48:21.855
Christ.

48:21.986 --> 48:24.902
The last thing I wanna do
is upset you, Sassenach.

48:25.032 --> 48:27.905
By making it sound
as though it was--

48:27.992 --> 48:29.950
I dinna wish to malign
the poor woman

48:30.081 --> 48:31.343
-by making it seem she was--
-Who?

48:31.430 --> 48:32.692
Jesus!

48:34.607 --> 48:36.435
Mary MacNab.

48:38.132 --> 48:39.742
Who the hell is Mary MacNab?

48:39.873 --> 48:42.267
Ye kent her, Sassenach.

48:43.877 --> 48:46.401
She was the mother to Rabbie,

48:46.532 --> 48:47.750
stable-lad at Lallybroch.

48:49.752 --> 48:51.493
It was the...

48:51.624 --> 48:54.105
the night before I gave
myself up to the Redcoats.

48:54.192 --> 48:55.715
She came to me.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.457
I was in the cave.

49:00.459 --> 49:02.591
She brought me supper

49:02.722 --> 49:04.724
and then she...

49:04.811 --> 49:07.335
she stayed.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.381
I tried to send her away,
but...

49:12.427 --> 49:15.082
...she said she'd seen you
with me, Claire.

49:17.041 --> 49:20.914
She kent the look
of true love when she saw it.

49:21.045 --> 49:24.352
And it wasna in her mind
to betray that.

49:24.439 --> 49:27.138
She give me a...a small thing.

49:28.878 --> 49:31.707
It was and it wasna.

49:33.796 --> 49:35.233
She gave me tenderness.

49:38.149 --> 49:39.802
I hope I gave her the same.

49:42.892 --> 49:44.764
Sure you gave her tenderness.

49:46.461 --> 49:48.115
I know you did.

49:52.119 --> 49:54.774
I just wish you told me
about it.

49:54.904 --> 49:56.776
I couldna think how.

49:56.906 --> 49:58.996
How to tell you
that you'd understand.

50:02.216 --> 50:04.044
But of course, I understand.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.356
So...

50:11.486 --> 50:12.922
do you believe me about Malva?

50:17.536 --> 50:19.538
Yes.

50:19.668 --> 50:23.237
Not only because of you and me,

50:23.324 --> 50:26.414
but because
if it had have happened...

50:29.939 --> 50:32.507
...I know you would've never
turned your back

50:32.594 --> 50:36.337
on a child of your blood,

50:36.424 --> 50:38.470
no matter how it came
into the world.

50:43.562 --> 50:46.608
So...

50:46.739 --> 50:48.262
what do we do now?

50:50.221 --> 50:52.919
Find out the truth if we can.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.880
By daybreak, the whole of the
Ridge will ken what happened.

50:59.273 --> 51:01.014
But no one will believe it.

51:03.538 --> 51:05.018
They'll all believe it, Claire.

51:07.107 --> 51:08.543
I'm sorry.

51:19.641 --> 51:20.816
[Brianna] God damn Mrs. Bug.

51:20.947 --> 51:22.601
It'll be all over
the Ridge now.

51:22.731 --> 51:24.516
Why would Malva do this?

51:24.646 --> 51:26.431
Mama has always been
so kind to her.

51:26.561 --> 51:28.085
Either the real father
is someone

51:28.215 --> 51:31.697
she doesn't want to marry
or she's decided to try and go

51:31.827 --> 51:34.265
after Jamie's money
or property or both.

51:34.352 --> 51:35.701
Well, it isn't true.

51:35.788 --> 51:37.311
Dad wouldn't this.

51:39.444 --> 51:42.795
-Would he?
-No, he wouldn't.

51:43.970 --> 51:45.276
Brianna, you can't possibly
think there's any truth to it?

51:45.406 --> 51:46.755
No, no.
Of course, not.

51:46.886 --> 51:48.017
Of course, not.
I just...

51:52.021 --> 51:55.024
Do you remember
when we went to Harvard

51:55.155 --> 51:57.157
for that ceremony
to honor Daddy?

51:57.244 --> 51:59.594
Aye.

51:59.725 --> 52:03.032
Well, there was this woman
there that I recognized.

52:05.818 --> 52:07.776
Her name was Sandy.

52:08.690 --> 52:10.562
We ran into her
once at a bookstore.

52:12.825 --> 52:14.696
And I saw the way
Daddy looked at her.

52:16.785 --> 52:18.700
And then she showed up
at our house once

52:18.831 --> 52:22.530
during Mama's graduation party,

52:22.661 --> 52:26.839
and Mama finally told me
that he was in love with her

52:26.969 --> 52:29.015
and planned to marry her.

52:32.627 --> 52:36.762
Frank was
a totally different situation.

52:36.892 --> 52:39.025
Your mother loved
another man for 20 years.

52:39.156 --> 52:40.940
Your father knew it, Brianna.

52:43.116 --> 52:45.336
Jamie is an honorable man

52:45.466 --> 52:47.381
and he loves
your mother deeply.

52:47.512 --> 52:49.731
See, that's just the thing.

52:50.776 --> 52:53.213
Roger, I would have
sworn that Daddy was too.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.134
[bleating]

53:04.137 --> 53:06.226
[axe thwacking]

53:14.452 --> 53:16.497
If you've come to ask me
to take it back--

53:16.628 --> 53:18.151
I just want to talk.

53:18.282 --> 53:19.500
Nothing to talk about.

53:21.067 --> 53:22.416
Then maybe I could listen.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.507
I doubt you've been able
to talk to anyone,

53:26.594 --> 53:28.335
especially not your father
or brother--

53:28.466 --> 53:30.642
Why would they listen
to a whore?

53:30.772 --> 53:32.426
[Claire] I don't think
you're a whore, Malva.

53:32.557 --> 53:33.645
What else would you
call a woman

53:33.775 --> 53:35.212
who spreads her legs
for a married man?

53:36.648 --> 53:38.258
My father made me
stand in front

53:38.389 --> 53:40.478
of the congregation
and confess.

53:40.608 --> 53:43.176
Mr. MacKenzie told him not to,
but he did it anyway.

53:43.307 --> 53:45.091
[Claire]
Do you know what I think?

53:45.222 --> 53:48.834
I think you're a young woman
who made a mistake,

53:48.964 --> 53:50.662
but it wasn't with my husband.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.359
Perhaps it was he
who made the mistake

53:52.446 --> 53:53.795
and now I'm carrying
the blame for it.

53:53.926 --> 53:55.536
[Claire] No.

53:55.667 --> 53:57.669
No, no, I believe him.

53:57.799 --> 53:59.497
Completely.

54:02.064 --> 54:03.283
You know, he and I have been
through things

54:03.414 --> 54:05.242
that you couldn't even imagine.

54:05.372 --> 54:08.245
And this...

54:08.332 --> 54:11.683
I promise you,
it won't come between us.

54:15.904 --> 54:19.386
Malva, I'm sorry

54:19.517 --> 54:22.128
for whatever it is
that you're going through

54:22.259 --> 54:24.783
that would make you
so desperate to do this.

54:24.913 --> 54:26.437
You're apologizing to me?

54:27.829 --> 54:29.222
[Claire] I care about you.

54:29.353 --> 54:32.747
Now, I see in you this...

54:32.878 --> 54:35.446
clever young woman

54:35.533 --> 54:37.883
full of curiosity
and enthusiasm.

54:40.538 --> 54:42.757
And I was proud
to be your teacher.

54:42.888 --> 54:44.106
[Malva cries]

54:46.413 --> 54:49.024
It's-it's not too late, Malva.

54:49.155 --> 54:50.809
You can still tell the truth.

54:53.681 --> 54:55.770
It's going to be all right.

54:55.901 --> 55:00.645
No, it can't be.

55:02.342 --> 55:04.170
It can never be.

55:04.301 --> 55:05.780
[Allan] Get away from her!

55:07.521 --> 55:09.915
What d'you mean,
coming here like this?

55:10.002 --> 55:12.570
I was just trying to--

55:12.700 --> 55:14.920
If you hadn't meddled
in our family

55:15.050 --> 55:19.228
and tried to teach Malva
your devilish ways,

55:19.359 --> 55:20.447
this never would have happened.

55:20.578 --> 55:22.014
[Claire] You're wrong.

She says you make potions

from the dead.

She's a witch.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.686
And we know what happens
to witches, don't we, Malva?

55:44.036 --> 55:46.560
Aye. We do.

56:13.021 --> 56:16.634

sowing wild oats of his own.

Are you all right, Auntie?

57:16.911 --> 57:17.956
I'm fine.

57:21.742 --> 57:24.615
I wanted to ask you something.

57:24.745 --> 57:28.270
It's about...
it's about Malva Christie.

57:29.794 --> 57:31.970
What about her?

57:32.100 --> 57:36.061
[Young Ian]
Well, not her exactly.

57:37.062 --> 57:38.324
More of what she said
about Uncle Jamie.

57:41.719 --> 57:43.895
Ian, you mustn't worry
yourself about it.

57:44.025 --> 57:46.680
It will...

57:46.811 --> 57:50.205
it will come right somehow

57:50.336 --> 57:52.686
as things always do.

57:52.817 --> 57:54.035
[Young Ian] It's only what
they're sayin' about him.

57:55.428 --> 57:56.951
I canna bear to hear it.

57:57.082 --> 57:59.476
Ian, it's impossible

57:59.563 --> 58:01.739
that Jamie would be the father
of Malva's child.

58:03.958 --> 58:05.482
You do understand that,
don't you?

58:06.961 --> 58:08.397
I-I do, Auntie.

58:16.841 --> 58:18.190
But it could be mine.

58:22.455 --> 58:23.456
What?

58:26.720 --> 58:28.679
Ian,

58:28.809 --> 58:31.769
are you saying that
to protect Jamie

58:31.856 --> 58:33.118
because if you are--

58:33.248 --> 58:36.513
It was only once.

58:36.643 --> 58:38.689
She is so beautiful.

58:38.819 --> 58:40.778
And she talked to me.

58:40.908 --> 58:44.608
She wasn't as shy
like the other lasses.

58:44.738 --> 58:48.873
She was curious about my life,
and I wanted to feel again.

58:50.439 --> 58:53.007
One day I was at the river

58:53.138 --> 58:56.141
with her and we...

58:56.271 --> 58:57.751
we lay together.

59:00.014 --> 59:03.409
But later, it didna feel right.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.498
I told her that I was sorry,

59:05.585 --> 59:07.369
but that I loved another.

59:09.894 --> 59:11.678
That I still loved Emily.

59:13.550 --> 59:14.986
And it couldn't happen again.

59:16.857 --> 59:19.556
Auntie, do you think
I scorned her,

59:19.643 --> 59:22.210
and that's what made
her accuse Uncle Jamie?

59:22.297 --> 59:24.343
Ian, it's not your fault.

59:24.473 --> 59:26.867
But she's carryin' my child.

59:29.174 --> 59:30.436
I'll marry her.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.656
I'll be a husband and a father.

59:32.786 --> 59:34.135
I'll do it
for the bairn's sake.

59:34.222 --> 59:36.398
Ian, it may not be your baby.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.055
Roger said that he saw her
with Obadiah Henderson.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.319
There might have been others.

59:48.497 --> 59:51.109
But it might be mine.

59:51.239 --> 59:52.589
And it isna Uncle Jamie's.

59:54.808 --> 59:57.898
Would it help him,
do you think?

59:57.985 --> 1:00:00.292
I could try and talk to her.

1:00:00.422 --> 1:00:03.512
I don't think you should do
anything right now.

1:00:03.643 --> 1:00:05.689
Just let me talk
to Jamie first.

1:00:05.819 --> 1:00:07.560
Do you mind if I tell him?

1:00:08.779 --> 1:00:11.216
I wish you would.

1:00:11.346 --> 1:00:13.000
I dinna think
I could face him myself.

1:00:15.612 --> 1:00:17.309
[Claire] Despite Ian's news,

1:00:17.439 --> 1:00:19.398
the damage was already done.

1:00:19.528 --> 1:00:21.922
From that day on,

1:00:22.009 --> 1:00:24.359
we lived
under a cloud of darkness.

to confide in.

Most of the settlers
wouldn't even look at me.

1:00:33.891 --> 1:00:35.588
We were pariahs.

1:00:39.374 --> 1:00:41.507
And while Jamie was away
at the Congress,

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:44.510
preparing to revolt
against Great Britain,

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:46.904
the Ridge was mounting
a rebellion of its own.

1:01:00.395 --> 1:01:01.745
[Jamie] A scholar he may be,

1:01:01.832 --> 1:01:05.096
but I didna think Roger Mac
realized

1:01:05.226 --> 1:01:06.793
all worthwhile business
is conducted

1:01:06.924 --> 1:01:08.360

1:01:08.447 --> 1:01:11.102

1:01:13.931 --> 1:01:17.543

from the King...

involved in making history.

[Brianna] I'll bet.

1:01:46.790 --> 1:01:48.487
Did he declare himself
for liberty then?

1:01:48.617 --> 1:01:50.271
[Roger] Aye.
He said we should be

1:01:50.402 --> 1:01:52.230

Harnett was right.
