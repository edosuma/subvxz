Rose? Dorothy?

00:57.967 --> 00:59.166
Sophia!

01:00.433 --> 01:02.867
The coast is clear.
Come on in, Ed.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.567
My roommates are still shopping.
We have the place to ourselves.

01:10.033 --> 01:12.467
Now let's find out
who's naughty or nice.

01:18.633 --> 01:21.667
Didn't you have the best time
Christmas shopping?

01:21.734 --> 01:23.300
I loved it.

01:23.367 --> 01:27.133
Being shoved all day so I could
buy gifts I can't afford...

01:27.934 --> 01:29.900
is a regular
yuletide treat.

01:31.266 --> 01:32.900
Why have you been
so grouchy all day?

01:32.967 --> 01:34.567
Oh, I'm sorry, Rose.

01:34.633 --> 01:37.667
I'm just sad because Christmas
has no meaning anymore.

01:37.734 --> 01:39.200
It's gotten so commercial.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.300
-How can you say that?
-Oh, please, Rose.

01:41.367 --> 01:44.400
The three wise men
in Burdine's nativity scene

01:44.467 --> 01:46.900
were wearing
Ralph Lauren ski parkas.

01:48.300 --> 01:51.233
Catch me, catch me, catch me!

01:54.834 --> 01:56.600
Let me take a wild guess.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.767
You didn't expect us home
this early.

01:59.834 --> 02:01.533
Dorothy, Rose, meet--

02:01.600 --> 02:03.700
We know who he is, Blanche.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.166
Santa, how could you?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.100
Rose, this is Ed Kleckner.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.467
He's on his break from the mall.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.200
A Santa is never off-duty.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.867
As long as you're in that uniform,

02:17.934 --> 02:21.834
you should think about giving people
what they want for Christmas.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.867
He was trying to, Rose.

02:28.734 --> 02:30.467
I saw Blanche's list.

02:32.066 --> 02:35.867
Get your cap, get your beard,
and get moving.

02:35.934 --> 02:39.166
I stood in line an hour
to sit on his lap.

02:40.567 --> 02:41.734
Tough holly!

02:42.567 --> 02:45.000
What would Mrs. Claus say?

02:45.066 --> 02:46.800
Not to mention Mrs. Kleckner.

02:49.533 --> 02:50.400
Who was that?

02:50.467 --> 02:51.667
He's a Santa Claus.

02:51.734 --> 02:53.934
I thought it was Fidel Castro.

02:54.867 --> 02:56.500
I meant why was he here?

02:56.567 --> 02:58.567
Blanche picked him up shopping.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.266
I can't help it.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.767
Something about a Santa Claus suit
just drives me absolutely crazy.

03:04.834 --> 03:09.934
Maybe it's the warmth of all of
that red, hot, sweaty flannel...

03:11.967 --> 03:13.633
set against the austere coldness

03:13.700 --> 03:16.133
of those black patent leather
jackboots.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.934
Or maybe it's because those
rosy cheeks and twinkling eyes

03:21.033 --> 03:23.166
bespeak a passion that's about
to erupt from a man

03:23.233 --> 03:27.166
who just spent a cold lonely year
cooped up with a pack of dwarfs.

03:28.867 --> 03:30.533
I'm not sure.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.533
All I know is the sight of Santa

03:32.600 --> 03:35.867
sets my body aflame
with unbridled desire.

03:43.567 --> 03:46.900
Blanche, you do realize
you're in the minority on this.

03:48.433 --> 03:51.033
Sophia, did you finish
shopping today?

03:51.100 --> 03:54.800
Just about. It's unbelievable,
the price of things these days.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.700
I just spent $89
for my granddaughter's doll.

03:57.767 --> 04:00.100
Ma, you had $89?

04:00.166 --> 04:04.300
No. I charged my gifts
with your credit card.

04:06.266 --> 04:07.834
You're taking them back!

04:08.333 --> 04:11.066
Even the beautiful cashmere sweater
I got Blanche?

04:11.133 --> 04:13.300
Cashmere?
I love cashmere.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.033
Don't tell me. Tell scrooge.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.433
Rose, I hope you didn't have
your heart set on a video recorder.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.467
You bought me
a video recorder?

04:22.533 --> 04:25.066
I bought you a video recorder.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.233
2 video recorders?

04:28.300 --> 04:30.967
This will be
the best Christmas ever.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.800
How did you think
I would pay for this?

04:35.867 --> 04:37.133
On time.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.834
Loosen up the mousetrap
a little. It's Christmas.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.667
You see what this
holiday has become?

04:42.734 --> 04:46.767
Everybody tries to show
they care by going into debt.

04:46.834 --> 04:49.934
Where is the love?
Where's the sharing?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.266
Where is the true spirit
of Christmas?

04:53.333 --> 04:55.900
Neiman-Marcus,
ladies' apparel, third floor.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.834
Maybe you're right, Dorothy.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.100
I've spent too much
again this year.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.667
I have a terrific idea.

05:03.734 --> 05:06.834
Before we leave for Christmas
with our families,

05:06.900 --> 05:10.934
why don't we have a little
celebration here, St. Olaf style?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.734
I will not drink eggnog
while wearing a cast-iron brassiere.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.233
We don't do that at Christmas.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.367
We do that at easter.

05:21.633 --> 05:25.166
At Christmas,
we make gifts for each other.

05:25.667 --> 05:29.500
Rose, that is a great idea.

05:29.567 --> 05:32.800
We'll return those meaningless
impersonal gifts

05:32.867 --> 05:34.166
we always buy for each other,

05:34.233 --> 05:37.333
and we'll make something
that comes from the heart.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.800
That's a terrific idea.

05:38.867 --> 05:40.066
What do you say?

05:40.133 --> 05:43.166
Unless you make a lamb's wool jacket
with a fake fur collar,

05:43.233 --> 05:45.433
my heart is staying
with Neiman-Marcus,

05:45.500 --> 05:47.000
ladies' apparel, third floor.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.834
This one's from me, Dorothy.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.233
They're very popular back home.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.166
It took nearly a week to whittle it.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.533
Oh, Rose!

06:03.600 --> 06:05.066
-Do you like it?
-Like it?

06:05.133 --> 06:07.133
Oh, honey,
I love it!

06:08.266 --> 06:10.934
Who wouldn't love
a wooden brooch

06:11.000 --> 06:13.100
in the shape
of a turkey's head?

06:15.900 --> 06:17.166
Oh, no.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.333
No, that's a maple syrup spigot.

06:21.333 --> 06:24.066
She took back
some pearl earrings.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.367
The ones I love
from Jordan Marsh?

06:26.433 --> 06:28.367
Yep. Ho-ho-ho.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.567
Oh, ma, who cares?

06:33.633 --> 06:35.567
Rose, I love it.

06:35.633 --> 06:38.667
This will be much handier
than those earrings...

06:38.734 --> 06:42.200
When I'm lost in the woods
with a stack of pancakes.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.066
I want to give you all my gift next.

06:50.133 --> 06:54.333
I thought this was so cute,
I made them all alike.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.367
Here. Sophia.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.767
"The men of Blanche's boudoir."

07:05.100 --> 07:07.000
It's a calendar.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.533
Each month has the picture of a man

07:10.600 --> 07:12.967
who's brought special joy
into my life.

07:14.266 --> 07:18.033
Aw, Blanche.
Honey, this is so thoughtful.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.467
Whoa!

07:24.600 --> 07:25.700
September?

07:25.767 --> 07:26.600
Yep.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.100
Surprised you could walk
in October.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.800
Just think, girls.
Tomorrow's Christmas eve.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.800
We'll be with our families.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.000
Oh, there's nothing like
Christmas in Minnesota.

07:48.066 --> 07:50.567
Unless it's Christmas in New York.

07:50.633 --> 07:53.100
A light snow falling over
5th avenue,

07:53.166 --> 07:57.800
ice skaters at Rockefeller center,
Santa's on every street corner...

07:57.867 --> 07:59.100
Really?

08:03.433 --> 08:07.467
I guess my very favorite Christmas
was in New York.

08:07.533 --> 08:10.133
It was Christmas, 1932.
You remember, ma?

08:10.200 --> 08:11.700
Do I remember.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.600
No.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.867
My family doesn't
stay in touch year-round.

08:17.934 --> 08:22.667
But come Christmastime,
we all make it back home.

08:22.734 --> 08:25.333
I guess that's what
Christmas means.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.867
I'm looking forward to it.

08:26.934 --> 08:28.400
We all are.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.467
We should get some rest.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.200
Don't forget I work tomorrow.

08:32.266 --> 08:36.300
You'll have to pick me up
on your way to the airport.

08:36.367 --> 08:37.600
Oh, no problem, honey.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.166
Coming to bed, ma?

08:41.233 --> 08:44.266
I'll sit and look
at the Christmas tree.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.900
It sure is beautiful.

08:46.967 --> 08:48.800
I think I'll stay
and keep you company.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.467
That's a good idea.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.900
I hate to see
this pleasant evening end.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.500
Me, too.

09:00.900 --> 09:04.934
<i>♪ The first noel ♪</i>

09:05.000 --> 09:08.934
<i>♪ The angels did say ♪</i>

09:09.000 --> 09:10.967
Did I ever tell you
about the time...

09:13.467 --> 09:17.000
One Christmas, we tried to launch
a production of <i>a Christmas carol</i>

09:17.066 --> 09:18.867
with an all-chicken cast...

09:19.700 --> 09:20.934
My god, look at the time!

09:21.000 --> 09:24.500
Is it that late?
I'm so tired... exhausted!

09:32.767 --> 09:35.567
Mr. Thurber,
I don't understand your problem.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.100
Then I guess
I don't have one.

09:37.166 --> 09:41.433
Mr. Thurber, this is a crisis
center. I'm a trained counselor.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.567
Don't be embarrassed.
You can open up to me.

09:44.633 --> 09:47.166
Whatever's bothering you,
I know I can help.

09:47.233 --> 09:49.600
Ok. In the past week,

09:49.667 --> 09:53.066
I've lost my job,
my wife, my girlfriend,

09:53.133 --> 09:55.867
my house, my car,
and all my money.

09:55.934 --> 09:57.100
And then, just today,

09:57.166 --> 09:59.600
I've seriously gotten
into playing with matches.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.200
You need the professional services
of Dr. Escobar.

10:04.266 --> 10:07.233
He'll return from lunch soon.
Please have a seat.

10:07.934 --> 10:10.800
Mr. Thompson. You're next.

10:14.533 --> 10:17.500
Excuse me. Rose, let's go.
Ma's in the car.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.000
I'll only be a minute.
Have a seat.

10:48.266 --> 10:50.233
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:51.367 --> 10:52.600
Do you have a match?

10:54.767 --> 10:56.700
I think so.

11:00.033 --> 11:00.967
Here you go.

11:01.533 --> 11:02.600
Thanks.

11:13.834 --> 11:17.467
Have you ever looked at fire?
I mean, really looked at it?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.100
It's beautiful.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.500
It's amazing to think
how much damage it could do

11:23.567 --> 11:25.800
if it fell into the wrong hands.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.300
Rose...

11:32.900 --> 11:34.967
are you going to be
very much longer?

11:36.567 --> 11:37.533
Not now, Dorothy.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.600
This man is very down about
his financial situation.

11:40.667 --> 11:44.033
He was a principal backer
of "Howard the duck."

11:49.767 --> 11:51.300
Going somewhere for Christmas?

11:52.300 --> 11:54.800
Well, yes, I'm going home
to see my family.

11:54.867 --> 11:57.767
Gee, I wish I was going somewhere
for Christmas.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.667
But my family disowned me.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.233
They're embarrassed
because I'm an artist.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.433
What kind of artist?

12:03.500 --> 12:04.967
An unsuccessful one.

12:06.233 --> 12:09.633
I haven't sold a painting in a year.
I haven't eaten in a week.

12:09.700 --> 12:12.266
Last night, I burned all my brushes
just to stay warm.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.567
Wow.
That must have been beautiful.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.800
I just hate to see an artist suffer.

12:20.867 --> 12:24.400
Look here, $20. You have
Christmas dinner on me.

12:24.467 --> 12:27.567
I'll see you after the first,
Mr. Thompson.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.100
And happy new year.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.633
Ok, girls, I'm ready to go.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.200
Thanks for the money.

12:35.266 --> 12:37.934
Blanche, did you give
Mr. Meyer money?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.266
Yes. He's a starving artist.

12:40.333 --> 12:44.433
He owns the most successful
wide-size shoe store in the city.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.266
He's a pathological liar.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.300
I am not.

12:48.367 --> 12:49.300
See?

12:49.367 --> 12:51.834
Who cares?
We're going to be late.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.400
Merry Christmas.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.633
Oh!

12:59.667 --> 13:01.567
Hello there, tall, dark, and jolly!

13:03.266 --> 13:06.800
Blanche, maybe you should stay
and talk to a counselor too.

13:06.867 --> 13:11.066
Oh, look. Santa's come
to spread some Christmas cheer.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.834
-Great.
-Good luck with them.

13:13.900 --> 13:14.600
Hold it!

13:15.767 --> 13:17.934
No one's going anywhere.

13:27.967 --> 13:30.800
We won't give you any trouble.
You can have our money.

13:30.867 --> 13:33.533
I'm not here to rob anybody.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.700
I'm Santa's helper. Give me a break!

13:37.567 --> 13:39.567
Then what's this about?

13:39.633 --> 13:43.433
I wanted to share an old-fashioned
Christmas with some other people.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.667
At gunpoint?

13:45.166 --> 13:47.867
Would you stay
if I just asked you?

13:54.900 --> 13:57.500
-No.
-Well...

13:57.567 --> 14:01.467
Why would you want to spend
Christmas with strangers?

14:01.533 --> 14:04.233
It has to be better than
spending it alone.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.000
Christmas has,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:08.066 --> 14:11.367
Christmas has always
been lonely for me.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.667
I always have the Christmas spirit,
but no one ever notices.

14:14.734 --> 14:17.667
I never get gifts, cards,
dyed eggs--

14:17.734 --> 14:19.133
Dyed eggs?
That's easter.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.834
Another rotten holiday.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.033
Get away from the door.
That's it.

14:25.533 --> 14:28.633
Now, why don't we get this
celebration going?

14:28.700 --> 14:30.433
Let's sing some Christmas carols.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.100
Does everybody know "Silent night"?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.100
Know it?
I wrote it.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.700
You did not!

14:36.767 --> 14:38.367
I did. I'll prove it.

14:38.433 --> 14:41.133
<i>♪ Silent night ♪</i>

14:41.200 --> 14:43.467
<i>♪ Holy night ♪</i>

14:43.533 --> 14:47.633
What an honor.
Let me shake your hand. Move it.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.100
-We'll miss our plane.
-I have an idea.

14:53.166 --> 14:56.667
I'll create a diversion
by bending over seductively.

14:56.734 --> 14:59.433
You two sneak behind him
and give him a karate chop.

14:59.934 --> 15:02.834
Blanche, what are we,
Charlie's angels?

15:06.033 --> 15:09.700
I've been told I bear a striking
resemblance to miss Cheryl Ladd.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.767
Although my bosoms are perkier.

15:18.266 --> 15:22.066
Not even if you were hanging
upside down on a trapeze.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.166
Excuse me.

15:28.233 --> 15:30.066
That guy who wrote
"Silent night"

15:30.133 --> 15:32.967
was the original choice
for potsie on "Happy days."

15:33.834 --> 15:36.400
How the mighty have fallen.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.600
This place is always filled
with nice people.

15:39.667 --> 15:42.066
Years ago,
when I had a problem,

15:42.133 --> 15:44.433
coming here
always cheered me up.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.166
That's why I decided
to spend Christmas here.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.767
Oh, oh, oh!

15:49.834 --> 15:53.500
I brought enough presents
for everybody.

15:53.567 --> 15:56.166
He's keeping us
from going home.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.834
We can't do anything.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.233
Ok, everybody.
Here's your presents.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.400
Hope you like them.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.734
-We don't want your presents!
-But it's Christmas.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.166
You've ruined our Christmas.
I'll handle this.

16:09.233 --> 16:13.266
I'm not surprised you always spend
Christmas alone. You know why?

16:13.333 --> 16:16.066
Because you don't know
what Christmas is all about.

16:16.133 --> 16:18.767
People don't owe you
a nice Christmas

16:18.834 --> 16:21.500
because that makes you happy.

16:21.567 --> 16:24.633
You can force us to stay here,

16:24.700 --> 16:29.867
but you can't force us to celebrate
this most joyous holiday with you.

16:29.934 --> 16:33.333
I've been sitting in the car
for half an hour.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.767
What am I, a Dachshund?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.500
Ma, be careful.
He has a gun.

16:47.033 --> 16:48.400
This is a toy.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.533
He's been holding us hostage
with a toy gun?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.300
I can't believe it.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.367
Neither can I.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.133
Dorothy,
you call yourself an Italian,

16:57.200 --> 17:00.166
you can't tell a toy
from a real piece?

17:05.467 --> 17:07.367
I feel so ashamed.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.333
Everything you said
about me is true.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.967
I'm a loser.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.867
You're not a loser.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.367
You just need some help.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.033
Maybe you're right.

17:19.100 --> 17:23.133
Mrs. Nylund, much of what you
said applies to me too.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.900
I've been lying all my life.

17:25.967 --> 17:29.266
I realize I was doing it
just to get attention.

17:29.934 --> 17:32.333
It's time for me to stop.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.667
Oh, Mr. Meyer.
That's wonderful!

17:35.734 --> 17:37.133
Marvelous! Let's get going.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.333
I could have walked
to New York by now.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.867
Oh, Dr. Escobar.
I'm so glad you're here.

17:41.934 --> 17:44.000
I've no time to explain,
'cause I have to catch a plane

17:44.066 --> 17:47.233
but this gentleman
wants to talk to you.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.734
Dr. Escobar,
perhaps we should talk too.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.533
I'm Dr. Rooney
from the Mayo clinic.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.300
I'll explain the particulars
of this man's case.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.734
Good lord, we made it!

18:05.800 --> 18:08.100
Girls, I don't know what to say.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.567
-Say goodbye.
-Goodbye. Merry Christmas.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.166
Goodbye.
Have a wonderful time.

18:14.233 --> 18:16.633
I'll miss you.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.700
Merry Christmas!

18:18.767 --> 18:20.000
Bye!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.066
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

18:22.133 --> 18:25.000
<i>due to severe storms</i>
<i>passing through the area,</i>

18:25.066 --> 18:27.467
<i>all flights out of</i>
<i>Miami international airport</i>

18:27.533 --> 18:30.600
<i>have been canceled</i>
<i>until 6 am tomorrow.</i>

18:30.667 --> 18:32.333
<i>Have a merry Christmas.</i>

18:48.200 --> 18:51.200
Would you like to buy a flower?

18:51.266 --> 18:52.800
Beat it, chrome-dome!

18:54.333 --> 18:57.667
And while you're at it, get a job,
get a suit

18:57.734 --> 19:00.066
and kneel down and beg
your mother's forgiveness!

19:01.200 --> 19:02.700
Ma!

19:11.166 --> 19:13.734
I'm chilled to the bone.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.233
I've never seen it
be this cold in Miami.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.133
I think that storm's
getting worse.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.333
I disagree. I think the storm
was at its worse

19:21.400 --> 19:22.467
when we ran out of gas

19:22.533 --> 19:25.300
and had to run 2 blocks
in the rain to get here.

19:25.367 --> 19:28.200
I appreciate everyone
leaving me stranded

19:28.266 --> 19:30.567
after my heel fell off in the middle
of that intersection.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.734
Good evening, ladies.
Welcome to Albert's diner.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.300
I'm Albert and merry Christmas.

19:36.367 --> 19:38.300
I'd like a cup of coffee.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.133
Coffee, sure. Coffee all around?

19:40.200 --> 19:43.333
I'd like a mug of hot apple cider
with a cinnamon stick.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.834
Lady, does this look like
Knott's berry farm?

19:47.533 --> 19:49.367
-Coffee will be fine.
-Coffee.

19:50.834 --> 19:53.734
Did I tell you girls
I met George on Christmas eve?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.400
How exciting.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.800
Let me tell you how exciting
Christmas eve can be.

19:58.867 --> 20:03.166
I was home for Christmas vacation
when my best friend fixed me up

20:03.233 --> 20:05.033
the most beautiful boy I'd seen.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.767
George?

20:06.834 --> 20:08.800
No. Richard J. Wilde.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.700
Believe me, his name said it all.

20:12.166 --> 20:16.233
We pulled over 5 times on our
way to that Christmas dance.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.266
It's best to drive defensively
over the holidays.

20:23.700 --> 20:27.400
Anyway, when we finally arrived,
Richard dropped me off,

20:27.467 --> 20:30.633
and I ran smack into a man
so gorgeous,

20:30.700 --> 20:34.033
he made Richard J. Wilde
look like a choir boy.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.700
George.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.200
No. Ernie Willis. Well...

20:38.967 --> 20:41.333
Ernie smiled,
and the next thing I knew,

20:41.400 --> 20:45.934
we danced in a local bar when
suddenly I heard a deep voice say,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.266
"May I cut in?"

20:47.333 --> 20:50.600
When I turned, I saw the man
I knew I was going to marry.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.767
George.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.100
No. Thomas Pinville. Uh-huh.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.233
After Thomas and I left--

21:00.300 --> 21:03.400
Blanche, I could get herpes
listening to this story.

21:08.133 --> 21:11.000
At what point did you
finally meet George?

21:11.066 --> 21:14.066
I didn't meet him that Christmas
eve. That was next year.

21:14.133 --> 21:17.734
That was boring. I said
I'd tell you an exciting story.

21:18.300 --> 21:21.433
I hate to see people
just drink coffee.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.934
It's Christmas. Please have some
cheesecake on me.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.367
That's very sweet of you.

21:27.433 --> 21:30.166
I'm too depressed
to eat cheesecake.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.400
Are you ladies
having a bad Christmas?

21:32.467 --> 21:34.834
-The worst.
-I'm down myself.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.133
It's tough working Christmas eve.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.133
I wish I was with my family.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.734
We aren't with our families, either.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.600
You all are not related?

21:44.667 --> 21:46.667
-No.
-Really?

21:46.734 --> 21:48.667
The way you were teasing
and talking,

21:48.734 --> 21:50.633
I thought you were
family for sure.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.066
Isn't that something.

21:55.233 --> 21:57.133
Well, isn't it funny how...

21:57.667 --> 21:59.266
sometimes it takes a total stranger

21:59.333 --> 22:02.367
to point out something
that's right there.

22:02.433 --> 22:05.100
We were feeling
so sorry for ourselves,

22:05.166 --> 22:09.533
we forgot we are celebrating
Christmas with family.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.100
Merry Christmas, Rose.

22:12.166 --> 22:14.233
Merry Christmas,
Blanche.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.166
Merry Christmas, Dorothy.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.000
Merry Christmas,
Blanche.

22:18.066 --> 22:19.400
Merry Christmas,
Rose.

22:19.467 --> 22:21.333
What the hell is this, <i>The Walton's?</i>

22:24.300 --> 22:27.700
So we're a family stuck
in a diner on Christmas eve.

22:27.767 --> 22:30.033
But at least we're together.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.667
I'm feeling better.

22:31.734 --> 22:35.033
My craving for cheesecake
has returned.

22:35.100 --> 22:38.467
That man's nice. I wish there was
something we could do for him.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.333
Maybe there is.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.600
-Excuse me.
-Yes, ma'am?

22:44.700 --> 22:47.266
How would you like to go home

22:47.333 --> 22:49.433
and spend Christmas eve
with your family?

22:49.500 --> 22:50.900
I'd love to, but--

22:50.967 --> 22:54.567
We'll watch the place
while you're gone.

22:54.633 --> 22:57.600
Oh... can you cook?

22:57.667 --> 22:59.333
Are you black?

23:03.734 --> 23:06.700
I promise I'll be back
in less than an hour.

23:06.767 --> 23:08.066
Thank you and merry Christmas.

23:08.133 --> 23:10.600
Merry Christmas!

23:10.667 --> 23:13.734
Girls, you know what
this cheesecake is missing?

23:13.800 --> 23:14.867
Chocolate syrup.

23:15.367 --> 23:18.066
-I wonder if he has any.
-I'll look in the back.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.367
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!

23:23.433 --> 23:24.767
-What?
-Take a look.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.767
That's snow!

23:26.834 --> 23:29.300
It's light, but it's snow.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.400
A white Christmas in Miami!
Can you beat that?

23:32.467 --> 23:36.133
Oh, this calls for some
Christmas music.

23:39.700 --> 23:44.633
("Surfing' Safari" plays)

23:44.700 --> 23:47.400
I think I pushed the wrong button.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.700
Rose, don't worry about it.

23:49.767 --> 23:53.133
Somehow this Christmas,
it fits.
