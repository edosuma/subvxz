01:49.533 --> 01:50.333
MAIN REPUBLICAN OPPONENT THIS

01:50.400 --> 01:52.066
TIME, HE HINTED THAT HE WOULD

01:52.133 --> 01:53.366
LIKE TO BE THE REPUBLICAN

01:53.433 --> 01:54.800
CANDIDATE IN THAT ELECTION, AND

01:54.866 --> 01:55.900

01:55.966 --> 01:59.833
THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA."

03:24.033 --> 03:25.566

03:40.600 --> 03:42.133
WOODWARD HAS, CALLED "PERIL."

03:42.200 --> 03:43.533
YES, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUM IT

03:43.600 --> 03:44.366
UP EXCEPT TAKE EVERYTHING YOU

03:44.433 --> 03:47.200
THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT

03:47.266 --> 03:49.033
DONALD TRUMP AND CONTINUE

03:49.100 --> 03:49.333

[LAUGHTER]

03:49.666 --> 03:52.900

03:52.966 --> 03:55.500
AND THE BIG REVELATION IN THE

03:55.566 --> 03:57.366
BOOK IS THAT IN THE PERIOD AFTER

03:57.433 --> 03:58.700
HE LOST THE ELECTION BEFORE

03:58.766 --> 04:00.700
BIDEN TOOK OVER ON

04:00.766 --> 04:01.400
INAUGURATION DAY, MY BIRTHDAY,

04:01.466 --> 04:04.900
NO BIG DEAL.

04:04.966 --> 04:05.566
[LAUGHTER]

04:05.633 --> 04:07.966
I'M TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO

04:08.033 --> 04:09.133
ASSOCIATE THE TWO.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.100
EVERY TIME THERE IS A NEW

04:11.166 --> 04:12.266
PRESIDENT, I GET GIFTS.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.833
BUT BIDEN IS OUR LAST PRESIDENT,

04:13.900 --> 04:15.366
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

04:15.433 --> 04:18.133
ANYWAY, GENERAL MARK MILLEY, HE

04:18.200 --> 04:20.133
IS THE HEAD OF THE JOINT CHIEFS

04:20.200 --> 04:22.633
OF STAFF, TOOK PRECAUTIONS TO

04:22.700 --> 04:24.833
LIMIT TRUMP'S ABILITY TO START A

04:24.900 --> 04:27.433
WAR, LAUNCH A STRIKE, NUCLEAR

04:27.500 --> 04:29.100
SHIT, YOU KNOW WHAT, MILLEY

04:29.166 --> 04:31.400
CALLED HIS COUNTERPART IN CHINA,

04:31.466 --> 04:34.966
IN GENERAL, TO ASSURE HIM IF

04:35.033 --> 04:37.733
THIS NOT TRIES TO NUKE YOU, I

04:37.800 --> 04:39.166
PROMISE I WILL STOP YOU.

04:39.233 --> 04:40.666
I THINK THE GUY WAS BRAVE.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.366
I THINK THIS IS AN ACT OF GREAT

04:42.433 --> 04:42.666
PATRIOTISM.

04:42.733 --> 04:46.433
[APPLAUSE]

04:46.500 --> 04:47.866
BUT NOW, GENERAL MILLEY, HE IS

04:47.933 --> 04:49.600
GETTING IT FROM BOTH SIDES, THE

04:49.666 --> 04:50.933
RIGHT DOES NOT LIKE THAT HE WENT

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
BEHIND TRUMP'S BACK, AND THOUGH

04:55.066 --> 04:56.866
THE LEFT DOES NOT LIKE THE FACT

04:56.933 --> 04:58.333
HE TALKED TO A GUY NAMED

04:58.400 --> 04:58.633
GENERAL LEE.

04:58.700 --> 04:58.900
[LAUGHTER]

04:58.966 --> 04:59.933
[APPLAUSE]

05:00.000 --> 05:02.033
AND HE DID.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.133
THIS GUY SHOULD GET A METAL.

05:04.200 --> 05:04.966
THIS IS HIS WORDS COME

05:05.033 --> 05:07.600
APPARENTLY COME IN THE BOOK.

05:07.666 --> 05:10.433
"GENERAL LI, I WANT TO ASSURE

05:10.500 --> 05:11.766
YOU THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS

05:11.833 --> 05:12.500
STABLE IN EVERY THING IS GOING

05:12.566 --> 05:13.366
TO BE OKAY."

05:13.433 --> 05:16.000
THIS IS THE SAME THING IN

05:16.066 --> 05:17.866
AMUSEMENT PARK TELLS YOU WHEN A

05:17.933 --> 05:18.966
KID DIES ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

05:19.033 --> 05:23.633
[APPLAUSE]

05:23.700 --> 05:25.033
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE FOLKS HAVE

05:25.100 --> 05:25.666
NOT STOPPED.

05:25.733 --> 05:26.266
TOMORROW IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

05:26.333 --> 05:29.333
THERE IS A BIG RALLY CALLED THE

05:29.400 --> 05:30.000
JUSTICE FOR JAY SIX.

05:30.066 --> 05:34.433
ANYONE GOING?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.800
THE INSURRECTION OF THE CAPITAL,

05:36.866 --> 05:38.166
AND RALLY TO SUPPORT THOSE

05:38.233 --> 05:39.100
PEOPLE.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.300
THEY WANT TO RAISE MONEY, ABOUT

05:40.366 --> 05:42.866
600 PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE WHO

05:42.933 --> 05:44.600
WERE ARRESTED FOR, I NEVER HEARD

05:44.666 --> 05:46.533
THIS TERM, BREAKING AND

05:46.600 --> 05:47.533
ENTERING.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.366
IT'S AT LEAST THAT, ISN'T IT?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.166
I SAW THAT ON VIDEO, BREAKING

05:51.233 --> 05:52.433
AND ENTERING, THAT IS STILL

05:52.500 --> 05:54.766
AGAINST THE LAW, ISN'T IT?

05:54.833 --> 05:58.133
HAPPENED TO BE THE CAPITOL, BUT

05:58.200 --> 05:59.433
YOU ARE BREAKING AND ENTERING.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.400
SO THEY NEED A LOT OF LAWYERS,

06:01.466 --> 06:03.300
WHICH I THINK IS VERY FUNNY FOR

06:03.366 --> 06:05.866
PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE CHANTING

06:05.933 --> 06:09.033
"JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US."

06:09.100 --> 06:10.000
[LAUGHTER]

06:10.066 --> 06:11.066
BUT THE ORGANIZERS SAY THEY WILL

06:11.133 --> 06:12.633
NOT BE ANY VIOLENCE, IT IS JUST

06:12.700 --> 06:13.600
A LITTLE GATHERING FOR THE

06:13.666 --> 06:14.400
PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T GET OFF WORK

06:14.466 --> 06:18.533
FOR THE ORIGINAL COUP.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.266

06:29.700 --> 06:32.233
TO ROUND UP, GET US BACK THERE.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.000
YOU KNEW THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY

06:33.066 --> 06:35.633
HAPPEN, RIGHT, THAT THEY WOULD

06:35.700 --> 06:36.833
GET THERE?

06:36.900 --> 06:39.100
TOO PARANOID TO ATTEND THEIR OWN

06:39.166 --> 06:39.700
PARANOIA RALLY.

06:39.766 --> 06:40.833
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A GREAT

07:27.533 --> 07:28.600
RECALL ELECTION, AND I NOTICED

07:28.666 --> 07:30.133
THAT LARRY ELDER SAID BEFORE THE

07:30.200 --> 07:32.666
VOTES WERE CAST, "IT'S RIGGED."

07:32.733 --> 07:35.533
TRUMP SAID THE ONLY WAY NEWSOM

07:35.600 --> 07:37.266
COULD WINS IF IT WAS RIGGED.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.333
WELL, MAYBE HE COULD WIN BECAUSE

07:39.400 --> 07:41.433
IT IS A HIGHLY DEMOCRAT STATE

07:41.500 --> 07:43.333
AND HE IS THE DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.966
THERE MAY BE ARE SOME OTHER WAYS

07:45.033 --> 07:46.866
HE COULD WIN, AND IT WAS NOT

07:46.933 --> 07:47.500
EXACTLY AN A-LIST FIELD HE WAS

07:47.566 --> 07:49.333
UP AGAINST.

07:49.400 --> 07:49.600
[LAUGHTER]

07:49.666 --> 07:52.033
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS THE

07:52.100 --> 07:52.500
NEW NORMAL.

07:52.566 --> 07:53.666
THAT ELECTIONS JUST DON'T COUNT.

07:53.733 --> 07:56.633
HOW DO WE GET BACK FROM THIS

07:56.700 --> 07:58.533
PLACE WHERE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE

07:58.600 --> 07:59.700
THAT ELECTIONS ARE REAL?

07:59.766 --> 08:01.400
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE

08:01.466 --> 08:04.400

08:04.466 --> 08:05.666
KNOWN AS PART OF THE

08:05.733 --> 08:06.433
AUTHORITARIAN PLAYBOOK.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.700
IT HAS BEEN USED IN OTHER TIMES

08:08.766 --> 08:09.466

THAT WHOEVER WINS, IF IT IS NOT

08:12.933 --> 08:14.833
ME, IT IS FAKE.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.700
CAST DOUBT ON THE PEOPLE WHO

08:16.766 --> 08:17.900
COME TO THE VOTES.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.333
CAST DOUBT ON THE MEDIA.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.000
UNDERMINE ANYONE WHO COULD DO

08:21.066 --> 08:22.266
CHECKS AND BALANCES.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.400
AND THAT WAY, WHEN YOU DO BREAK

08:23.466 --> 08:26.733
THE LAW AND WHEN YOU DO STORM

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
THE CAPITOL, AND WHEN YOU DO GET

08:28.266 --> 08:29.433
YOUR PROTESTERS AND

08:29.500 --> 08:31.100
DEMONSTRATORS TO SMASH THINGS

08:31.166 --> 08:32.866
UP, THEN PEOPLE WILL SAY, YOU

08:32.933 --> 08:34.900
KNOW, THAT YOU WILL HAVE

08:34.966 --> 08:35.933
LEGITIMACY TO DO THAT.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.200
SO, IT'S -- WHAT WE ARE WATCHING

08:37.266 --> 08:39.300
IS REALLY THE END GAME OF A

08:39.366 --> 08:40.833
LONG-TERM PROCESS.

08:40.900 --> 08:41.433
YOU KNOW, TRUMP HAS

08:41.500 --> 08:43.100
CONSISTENTLY, REALLY FROM THE

08:43.166 --> 08:45.400
TIME HE STARTED THE BIRTHERRISM

08:45.466 --> 08:47.600
CONSPIRACY THEORY, HE HAS BEEN

08:47.666 --> 08:48.233
UNDERMINING THE AMERICAN SYSTEM

08:48.300 --> 08:50.400
VERY, VERY SYSTEMATICALLY.

08:50.466 --> 08:52.266
AND GETTING PEOPLE BACK, IN

08:52.333 --> 08:53.666
OTHER WORDS, PERSUADING PEOPLE

08:53.733 --> 08:56.033
ONCE AGAIN TO BECOME PART OF THE

08:56.100 --> 08:58.133
POLITICAL MAINSTREAM IS A HUGE

08:58.200 --> 08:59.100
PROBLEM.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.833
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS TIME TO

09:00.900 --> 09:01.700
START THINKING ABOUT IT THE WAY

09:01.766 --> 09:03.333
WE THINK OF A COUNTRY LIKE

09:03.400 --> 09:04.266
NORTHERN IRELAND.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.600
HOW DID THE END THE DIVISIONS

09:05.666 --> 09:06.100
THERE?

09:06.166 --> 09:07.666
AND YOU HAVE TO START TALKING

09:07.733 --> 09:08.566
ABOUT PEACE TREATIES.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.733
YOU HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT

09:10.800 --> 09:11.766
TEACHING PEOPLE AGAIN THE RULES

09:11.833 --> 09:12.766
OF THE SYSTEM.

09:12.833 --> 09:14.733
YOU HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT

09:14.800 --> 09:15.633
FINDING COMMON GROUND.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.266
IT'S REALLY -- WE ARE MUCH

09:17.333 --> 09:19.000
FARTHER ALONG THAN I THINK MOST

09:19.066 --> 09:19.300
OF US THINK.

09:19.366 --> 09:20.000
>> Bill: I THINK IT STARTS

09:20.066 --> 09:22.400
WITH -- YOU ARE RIGHT,

09:22.466 --> 09:23.533
INTERESTING, I NEVER HEARD OF

09:23.600 --> 09:25.233
THAT ANALOGY TO NORTHERN

09:25.300 --> 09:26.733
IRELAND, BUT STOPPING HATE.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.900
I THINK IS THE BEGINNING OF IT.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.133
AND I SEE IT ON BOTH --

09:29.200 --> 09:30.966
[APPLAUSE]

09:31.033 --> 09:32.833
YEAH.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.466
BECAUSE IF YOU HATE SOMEONE, YOU

09:34.533 --> 09:35.366
WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING ABOUT

09:35.433 --> 09:35.900
THEM.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.333
AND YOU WILL BELIEVE THEY ARE

09:37.400 --> 09:38.100
CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.733
AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.700
IT IS NOT REALLY ABOUT THE

09:40.766 --> 09:41.233
ELECTION.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.366
IT IS ABOUT "I HATE THESE

09:43.433 --> 09:43.833
PEOPLE.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.533
I HATE THEM SO MUCH," THEY WILL

09:46.600 --> 09:47.066
DO ANYTHING.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.666
>> IT IS ABOUT "I HATE THESE

09:49.733 --> 09:50.666
PEOPLE AND ONLY WE DESERVE TO

09:50.733 --> 09:51.233
WIN.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.133
WE ARE THE REAL AMERICANS."

09:53.200 --> 09:54.166
JUST LIKE I HAVE HEARD IN

09:54.233 --> 09:55.300
POLAND.

09:55.366 --> 09:56.500
"WE ARE THE REAL POLAND."

09:56.566 --> 09:58.666
>> Bill: IS ON BOTH SIDES.

09:58.733 --> 10:00.433
ONE SIDE IS SCARIER BECAUSE THEY

10:00.500 --> 10:01.566
HAVE THE GUNS.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.366
>> ONE SIDE CONTROLS ONE OF THE

10:03.433 --> 10:05.666
MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES IN THIS

10:05.733 --> 10:05.900
COUNTRY.

10:05.966 --> 10:08.900
>> Bill: BUT I MUST TELL YOU,

10:08.966 --> 10:10.300
I ASKED THIS QUESTION ON THE

10:10.366 --> 10:11.666
SHOW, AND A LINE I HAVE BEEN

10:11.733 --> 10:14.500
SAYING IN MY STAND-UP ACT

10:14.566 --> 10:15.100
RECENTLY, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN

10:15.166 --> 10:16.733
THE PEOPLE IN YOUR GOVERNMENT

10:16.800 --> 10:17.733
DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR FORM OF

10:17.800 --> 10:18.666
GOVERNMENT?

10:18.733 --> 10:20.700
AT A NUMBER OF TIMES, IN A

10:20.766 --> 10:21.900
MOSTLY LIBERAL AUDIENCE, SOMEONE

10:21.966 --> 10:23.666
HAS YELLED OUT "KILL THEM."

10:23.733 --> 10:25.400
THAT IS A LIBERAL YELLING OUT

10:25.466 --> 10:26.300
"KILL THEM."

10:26.366 --> 10:28.833
>> WELL, THAT IS NOT A LIBERAL.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.900
>> Bill: IT IS.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.666
WELL, IT IS A DEMOCRAT.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.866
>> OR TO SOMEONE WHO IDENTIFIES

10:33.933 --> 10:34.533
THEMSELVES ON THE LEFT --

10:34.600 --> 10:36.833
>> Bill: NO, NO, NO YOU ARE

10:36.900 --> 10:37.233
BEING TRUE KIND.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.766
>> A TRUE LIBERAL DOES NOT

10:40.833 --> 10:41.100
BELIEVE THAT.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.233
>> Bill: TRUST ME, I AM AT MY

10:42.300 --> 10:43.866
OWN SHOW IS.

10:43.933 --> 10:44.533
[LAUGHTER]

10:44.600 --> 10:45.100
THEY DO BELIEVE THAT.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.600
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT BELIEF ON

10:46.666 --> 10:49.633
BOTH SIDES, THAT THESE PEOPLE --

10:49.700 --> 10:52.000
YOU CANNOT ABIDE THESE PEOPLE,

10:52.066 --> 10:52.866
THEY JUST HAVE TO SOMEHOW BE

10:52.933 --> 10:53.833
EXTIRPATED.

10:53.900 --> 10:54.933
I'M NOT SAYING LITERALLY THAT

10:55.000 --> 10:56.266
PEOPLE WANT TO KILL HALF THE

10:56.333 --> 10:57.633
COUNTRY, BUT THEY WOULD NOT BE

10:57.700 --> 10:59.500
UPSET IF HALF THE COUNTRY DIED.

10:59.566 --> 11:00.033
YOU KNOW?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.333
IT IS JUST THAT WE CAN'T LIVE

11:01.400 --> 11:02.366
WITH THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE NOT

11:02.433 --> 11:05.633
LIKE US AT ALL.

11:05.700 --> 11:06.266
EXISTENTIAL THREAT IS A TERM WE

11:06.333 --> 11:09.133
HEAR ON BOTH SIDES.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.766
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DIAL

11:10.833 --> 11:12.833
BACK FROM, DON'T YOU THINK?

11:12.900 --> 11:14.000
UNLESS WE DO THAT, UNLESS WE

11:14.066 --> 11:16.433
SEE -- STOP SEEING THE OTHER

11:16.500 --> 11:17.066
PERSON AS THIS MOTHER THAT DOES

11:17.133 --> 11:19.700
NOT BELONG HERE, I DON'T KNOW

11:19.766 --> 11:21.466
HOW WE ARE EVER GOING TO BELIEVE

11:21.533 --> 11:23.200
IN ANYTHING, LET ALONE AN

11:23.266 --> 11:24.100
ELECTION.

11:24.166 --> 11:24.866
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.

11:24.933 --> 11:26.233
POLARIZATION, THIS KIND OF

11:26.300 --> 11:27.233
DIVISION YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT,

11:27.300 --> 11:28.400
HAS THE EFFECT OF MAKING PEOPLE

11:28.466 --> 11:30.833
DOUBT THE SYSTEM, IN OTHER

11:30.900 --> 11:32.033
WORDS, IF WE HAVEN'T WON IN THE

11:32.100 --> 11:33.533
OTHER GUYS ARE IN CHARGE, THAT

11:33.600 --> 11:35.433
IT IS NOT REAL DEMOCRACY, IT IS

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
NOT REALLY AMERICA, WE ARE BEING

11:37.566 --> 11:39.833
OCCUPIED BY A FOREIGN POWER, BY

11:39.900 --> 11:41.466
TRADERS, IF YOU ARE HUNGARIAN OR

11:41.533 --> 11:43.266
JEWS OR ANYTHING ELSE, SO YES,

11:43.333 --> 11:45.266
YOU ARE RIGHT, SEEING THE OTHER

11:45.333 --> 11:47.166
SIDE IS HAVING SOME

11:47.233 --> 11:47.500
LEGITIMACY --

11:47.566 --> 11:48.033
>> Bill: SOME HUMANITY --

11:48.100 --> 11:49.800
>> INTO FINDING A WAY TO SHARE

11:49.866 --> 11:51.766
THE SYSTEM IS FUNDAMENTAL TO

11:51.833 --> 11:53.033
DEMOCRACY, AND IF WE DO NOT

11:53.100 --> 11:55.300
HAVE THAT, DEMOCRACY WON'T WORK.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.233
>> Bill: YOU SAID THE MYPILLOW

11:57.300 --> 11:58.233
GUY COULD DESTROY DEMOCRACY,

11:58.300 --> 12:00.800
WHICH ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE,

12:00.866 --> 12:03.833
BUT I WOULD REMIND PEOPLE, FOR

12:03.900 --> 12:06.033
AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING

12:06.100 --> 12:07.333
POLITICS, WHATEVER SOUNDS LIKE A

12:07.400 --> 12:09.666
JOKE TODAY WITH THE REPUBLICANS,

12:09.733 --> 12:11.533
TOMORROW IS THE CANDIDATE.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.300
RAGAN WAS A JOKE.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.633
I LOVE HIM BACK NOW.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.233
>> YES, YES.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.700
YOU SHOULD HEAR MY LIBERAL

12:19.766 --> 12:22.333
RELATIVES TALKING ABOUT WHAT A

12:22.400 --> 12:24.066
WONDERFUL PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH

12:24.133 --> 12:24.233
WAS.

12:24.300 --> 12:24.600
>> Bill: RIGHT.

12:24.666 --> 12:28.633
MORMONS LEGITIMATE THEN PALIN OR

12:28.700 --> 12:29.200
"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER."

12:29.266 --> 12:30.666
NOTHING IS A JOKE.

12:30.733 --> 12:35.666
I COULD SEE THE MYPILLOW GUY,

12:35.733 --> 12:36.533
TUCKER CARLSON, AS THE TICKET.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.833
>> YES.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.733
I HAD LUNCH WITH THE MYPILLOW

12:39.800 --> 12:41.966
GUY, WHICH I READ ABOUT.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.166
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

12:43.233 --> 12:44.700
DISARMING ABOUT HIM IS HE IS SO

12:44.766 --> 12:46.366
NORMAL.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.466
HE IS A KIND OF GOOFY MIDWESTERN

12:48.533 --> 12:49.133
BUSINESSMAN ON THE SURFACE, YOU

12:49.200 --> 12:49.733
KNOW, WHO WANTS TO TAKE THE

12:49.800 --> 12:53.500
CHECK FOR LUNCH AND SO ON, AND

12:53.566 --> 12:55.400
WHAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE WHEN

12:55.466 --> 12:57.066
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO HIM IS HE IS,

12:57.133 --> 12:59.266
IN OTHER WAYS, A NORMAL

12:59.333 --> 12:59.533
AMERICAN.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.466
BUT WHAT HE IS THE BENEFICIARY

13:00.533 --> 13:02.633
OF IS THE FACT THAT THE MORE

13:02.700 --> 13:05.666
EXTREME YOU BECOME IN OUR MEDIA

13:05.733 --> 13:08.166
ECHO SYSTEM, THE MORE YOU PUSH

13:08.233 --> 13:09.366
THINGS, THE MORE ATTENTION YOU

13:09.433 --> 13:13.100
GET, THE MORE LIKES AND SHARES

13:13.166 --> 13:14.833
YOU GET ON FACEBOOK AND

13:14.900 --> 13:16.866
SOCIAL MEDIA, AND HE HAS REALLY

13:16.933 --> 13:17.800
TAKEN ADVANTAGE, BOTH FOR

13:17.866 --> 13:18.366
POLITICS AND THAT IS HOW HE

13:18.433 --> 13:21.033
SELLS HIS PILLOWS.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.933
HE SAYS SOMETHING EXTREME ON FOX

13:23.000 --> 13:24.133
AND THEN PEOPLE CLICK ON HIS

13:24.200 --> 13:25.300
WEBSITE AND BUY PILLOWS.

13:25.366 --> 13:27.266
IT IS A KIND OF COMMERCIAL,

13:27.333 --> 13:27.733
POLITICAL GAME.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.900
BUT I THINK HE IS ALSO SOMEBODY

13:29.966 --> 13:31.700
WHO HAS GENUINELY COME TO

13:31.766 --> 13:33.500
BELIEVE SOME OF THE WACKIER

13:33.566 --> 13:34.200
CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND REALLY,

13:34.266 --> 13:36.000
IT IS KIND OF A GOOFY GUY FROM

13:36.066 --> 13:38.100
THE MIDWEST CAN BELIEVE IT, I

13:38.166 --> 13:38.866
THINK ANYBODY CAN.

13:38.933 --> 13:40.733
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE

13:40.800 --> 13:41.233
THESE THINGS SERIOUSLY.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.600
>> Bill: AND HE COULD NOT HAVE

13:42.666 --> 13:43.600
BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY BEFORE THE

13:43.666 --> 13:45.666
AGE OF THE INTERNET AND

13:45.733 --> 13:46.266
SOCIAL MEDIA, COULD HE?

13:46.333 --> 13:48.633
>> NO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD AN

13:48.700 --> 13:49.633
OUTLET TO DO THAT.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.166
>> Bill: RIGHT.

13:50.233 --> 13:52.166
>> HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A WAY TO

13:52.233 --> 13:52.400
SELL IT.

13:52.466 --> 13:54.100
>> Bill: RIGHT, IT HAS REALLY

13:54.166 --> 13:55.700
CHANGED THE GAME, AND YOU TALK

13:55.766 --> 13:58.100
ABOUT THAT IN YOUR ARTICLE IN

13:58.166 --> 13:59.100
"THE ATLANTIC," "THE NEW

13:59.166 --> 13:59.700
PURITANS," YOU TALK ABOUT THE

13:59.766 --> 14:01.600
FACT THEY ARE KIND OF TWO

14:01.666 --> 14:02.633
JUDICIAL SYSTEMS IN AMERICA, THE

14:02.700 --> 14:04.066
TRADITIONAL ONE WHICH BELIEVES

14:04.133 --> 14:07.533
IN PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND

14:07.600 --> 14:10.033
DEGREES OF CRIMES, YOU KNOW,

14:10.100 --> 14:10.500
LETTING THE STATUTE OF

14:10.566 --> 14:12.300
LIMITATIONS RUN OUT, AND THEN

14:12.366 --> 14:14.266
THERE IS THE SOCIAL MEDIA, WHAT

14:14.333 --> 14:16.500
THEY CALL CANCEL CULTURE GOING

14:16.566 --> 14:18.166
ON.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.800
AND IT'S INTERESTING, SOME OF

14:19.866 --> 14:21.566
THE PEOPLE YOU INTERVIEWED, I

14:21.633 --> 14:23.033
THINK THE TERM "VICTIMS" IS

14:23.100 --> 14:24.833
OVERUSED, BUT THERE ARE TRUE

14:24.900 --> 14:25.466
VICTIMS OF THIS, NOT NECESSARILY

14:25.533 --> 14:28.266
ONES WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT --

14:28.333 --> 14:29.900
>> NO, MANY OF THEM ARE NOT

14:29.966 --> 14:31.466
FAMOUS AT ALL, MANY OF THEM ARE

14:31.533 --> 14:32.033
NOT PEOPLE YOU'VE HEARD OF.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.866
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FALLEN

14:34.933 --> 14:36.833
VICTIM TO A COMBINATION OF

14:36.900 --> 14:39.566
SOCIAL MEDIA MOBS PLUS, OFTEN,

14:39.633 --> 14:40.166
ANONYMOUS BUREAUCRACIES.

14:40.233 --> 14:43.633
THERE WILL BE UNIVERSITY

14:43.700 --> 14:44.800
BUREAUCRACY OR HR BUREAUCRACIES

14:44.866 --> 14:46.433
WHO WILL INVESTIGATE THEM,

14:46.500 --> 14:47.333
SOMETIMES WITHOUT THEM KNOWING

14:47.400 --> 14:48.566
THAT THEY ARE BEING

14:48.633 --> 14:50.333
INVESTIGATED, AND THEN THEY ARE

14:50.400 --> 14:51.366
GIVING REALLY SEVERE

14:51.433 --> 14:52.700
PUNISHMENTS, YOU KNOW, LOSS OF

14:52.766 --> 14:54.200
CAREER, LOSS OF ABILITY TO

14:54.266 --> 14:55.400
PUBLISH, LOSS OF ABILITY TO MAKE

14:55.466 --> 14:55.733
MONEY.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.900
THEY LOSE ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND

14:56.966 --> 14:58.000
ALL THEIR COLLEAGUES.

14:58.066 --> 14:59.766
THEY BECOME OSTRACIZED.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.600
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF

15:01.666 --> 15:04.066
PUNISHMENTS, IN ANOTHER CULTURE,

15:04.133 --> 15:05.466
WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE MOST

15:05.533 --> 15:06.566
SEVERE.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.200
THE GREEKS CONSIDERED -- ANCIENT

15:08.266 --> 15:09.600
GREEKS -- OSTRACISM WAS THE NEXT

15:09.666 --> 15:10.566
WORST THING FOR THEM.

15:10.633 --> 15:11.133
>> Bill: RIGHT, IF YOU CAN'T

15:11.200 --> 15:15.033
GO TO DINNER ANYWHERE, THEN THEY

15:15.100 --> 15:16.966
LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE

15:17.033 --> 15:17.500
O.J. SIMPSON, YEAH.

15:17.566 --> 15:19.866
>> YEAH.

15:19.933 --> 15:21.600
>> Bill: PEOPLE HAVE KILLED

15:21.666 --> 15:21.966
THEMSELVES OVER.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.366
>> NOT COMMITTED CRIMES.

15:23.433 --> 15:25.866
THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE

15:25.933 --> 15:27.466
BEEN SENTENCED IN A COURT OF

15:27.533 --> 15:27.633
LAW.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.600
>> Bill: RIGHT.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.233
I MEAN, SOME OF THEM HAVE DONE

15:30.300 --> 15:31.333
SHITTY THINGS AND THEY DESERVE

15:31.400 --> 15:32.966
SOME DEGREE OF THAT, BUT THERE

15:33.033 --> 15:34.833
SEEMS TO BE A STATUTE OF

15:34.900 --> 15:36.166
LIMITATIONS --

15:36.233 --> 15:37.800
>> EXACTLY, THERE IS NO

15:37.866 --> 15:38.300
STATUTE --

15:38.366 --> 15:39.066
>> Bill: AND NO CONSISTENCY.

15:39.133 --> 15:40.933
>> WE DON'T HAVE AN AGREEMENT ON

15:41.000 --> 15:41.233
THE LIMITS.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.300
>> Bill: ALSO, SOME PEOPLE DO

15:42.366 --> 15:44.866
HORRIBLE THINGS AND GET A PASS.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.766
CHARLIE SHEEN GETS A SUPER BOWL

15:46.833 --> 15:47.066
COMMERCIAL.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.166
YOU KNOW, HE DID A LOT WORSE

15:49.233 --> 15:50.566
THINGS THAN LOUIS C.K.

15:50.633 --> 15:55.366
[APPLAUSE]

15:55.433 --> 15:57.533
AND HE COULDN'T GET A SUPER BOWL

15:57.600 --> 15:57.833
COMMERCIAL.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.800
>> RIGHT.

15:59.866 --> 16:00.866
>> Bill: THE OTHER POINT YOU

16:00.933 --> 16:03.066
MAKE ABOUT THIS, THERE ARE

16:03.133 --> 16:04.766
VICTIMS, AND THERE ARE ALSO

16:04.833 --> 16:06.000
CASUALTIES, LIKE FREE SPEECH.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.833
YOU SAY, IF WE ARE GOING TO

16:07.900 --> 16:10.000
DRIVE ALL THE DIFFICULT PEOPLE,

16:10.066 --> 16:11.400
THE DEMANDING PEOPLE, THE

16:11.466 --> 16:12.733
ECCENTRIC PEOPLE, I COUNT MYSELF

16:12.800 --> 16:15.666
ONE OF ALL THREE, --

16:15.733 --> 16:17.400
>> YOU SAID IT, NOT ME.

16:17.466 --> 16:18.700
>> Bill: YEAH, NO, I'M PROUD

16:18.766 --> 16:19.500
OF IT.

16:19.566 --> 16:20.666
I WANT TO BE DIFFICULT,

16:20.733 --> 16:23.166
DEMANDING, AND ECCENTRIC.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.200
[APPLAUSE]

16:25.266 --> 16:28.266
THANK YOU.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.933
THEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

16:30.000 --> 16:33.366
SOCIETY THAT IS AT A GREAT LOSS,

16:33.433 --> 16:35.466
YOU SAY WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THE

16:35.533 --> 16:43.300
GREAT MANUSCRIPTS THAT ARE ALL

16:43.366 --> 16:44.900
IN PEOPLE'S DRAWERS, THE JOKES

16:44.966 --> 16:45.266
THAT GO UNTOLD.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.000
IT IS ABOUT WHAT WE DON'T SEE

16:47.066 --> 16:47.566
BECAUSE IT IS UNSAID.

16:47.633 --> 16:51.266
I THINK SOMETHING LIKE 62% OF

16:51.333 --> 16:52.466
AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE AFRAID TO

16:52.533 --> 16:52.666
SPEAK.

16:52.733 --> 16:55.100
>> AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A RIGHT

16:55.166 --> 16:56.300
WING AND A LEFT-WING THING.

16:56.366 --> 16:58.600
WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT THIS

16:58.666 --> 16:59.433
BELONGING TO THE POLITICAL

16:59.500 --> 17:01.000
REALM, BUT REALLY IT IS A

17:01.066 --> 17:01.866
PHENOMENON CREATED BY

17:01.933 --> 17:03.533
SOCIAL MEDIA MOB'S, AS I SAID,

17:03.600 --> 17:04.766
BY NEW RULES ABOUT WHO WAS

17:04.833 --> 17:06.133
ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT, PEOPLE

17:06.200 --> 17:07.733
OFTEN JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

17:07.800 --> 17:09.066
RULES ARE, AND THEY ARE AFRAID

17:09.133 --> 17:10.766
OF BREAKING THEM BECAUSE THEY

17:10.833 --> 17:11.100
AREN'T SURE --

17:11.166 --> 17:12.633
>> Bill: AND THEY CHANGE

17:12.700 --> 17:12.966
WEEKLY.

17:13.033 --> 17:17.133
>> AND THEY CHANGE, AND THEY ARE

17:17.200 --> 17:17.800
DIFFERENT INSTITUTION TO

17:17.866 --> 17:18.266
INSTITUTION.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.733
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, IT HAS A

17:19.800 --> 17:20.700
CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE.

17:20.766 --> 17:22.666
AND THIS AGAIN, I'VE WRITTEN

17:22.733 --> 17:24.066
BOOKS ABOUT SOVIET DICTATORSHIP

17:24.133 --> 17:26.500
AND OTHER KINDS OF

17:26.566 --> 17:28.266
DICTATORSHIPS, AND I KNOW THIS

17:28.333 --> 17:29.166
KIND OF VERY EXTREME FORM OF

17:29.233 --> 17:30.666
PEER PRESSURE, AND IT'S OFTEN

17:30.733 --> 17:32.433
JUST AS IMPORTANT AS VIOLENCE

17:32.500 --> 17:34.700
AND OTHER KINDS OF THREATS IN

17:34.766 --> 17:35.300
KEEPING PEOPLE SILENT.

17:35.366 --> 17:36.833
SO IT IS SOMETHING WE REALLY

17:36.900 --> 17:38.366
DON'T WANT IN OUR COUNTRY.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.233
>> Bill: WELL, WE WILL TRY TO

17:39.300 --> 17:41.100
AVOID THAT HERE AT THE SHOW.

17:41.166 --> 17:42.966

18:29.300 --> 18:32.300
LET ME START A DISCUSSION

18:32.366 --> 18:33.800
TONIGHT WITH THIS, WHAT WE ARE

18:33.866 --> 18:34.366
LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

18:34.433 --> 18:39.933
BETWEEN ELECTION DAY AND JANUARS

18:40.000 --> 18:42.200
THE SUBJECT OF THIS NEW WOODWARD

18:42.266 --> 18:43.733
BOOK, AND APPARENTLY, THE

18:43.800 --> 18:44.366
GENERALS WERE VERY WORRIED THAT

18:44.433 --> 18:46.800
TRUMP WOULD DO SOMETHING BECAUSE

18:46.866 --> 18:48.966
HE WANTED TO STAY IN OFFICE THAT

18:49.033 --> 18:50.366
WOULD FOMENT A CRISIS, AND I'VE

18:50.433 --> 18:51.433
HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE

18:51.500 --> 18:54.566
RIGHT TO SAY "YEAH, TYPICAL

18:54.633 --> 18:55.033
LIBERAL OVERREACH.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.333
TRUMP DIDN'T START A WAR."

18:56.400 --> 18:57.500
I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT

18:57.566 --> 18:58.500
TONIGHT AND SAY, BUT WE KNOW

18:58.566 --> 18:59.866
THAT NOW.

18:59.933 --> 19:04.200
GIVEN THE THOUSAND ERRATIC,

19:04.266 --> 19:04.833
UNPRECEDENTED, DANGEROUS THINGS

19:04.900 --> 19:06.866
HE'D ALREADY DONE, WE COULDN'T

19:06.933 --> 19:14.766
HAVE KNOWN THAT AT THE TIME.

19:14.833 --> 19:15.333
>> AND HE DID START A WAR.

19:15.400 --> 19:15.833
A COLD CIVIL WAR IN THIS

19:15.900 --> 19:16.066
COUNTRY.

19:16.133 --> 19:16.433
>> Bill: WELL...

19:16.500 --> 19:18.833
[APPLAUSE]

19:18.900 --> 19:20.900
>> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TRUMP,

19:20.966 --> 19:22.533
IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FACT THAT

19:22.600 --> 19:24.800
ASIA RIGHT NOW IS A TINDERBOX,

19:24.866 --> 19:26.700
AND NO, WE HAVE NOT HAD A WAR SO

19:26.766 --> 19:28.800
FAR, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK WHAT IS

19:28.866 --> 19:30.200
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, TENSIONS

19:30.266 --> 19:32.266
RISING, AND THERE COULD BE A WAR

19:32.333 --> 19:32.766
IN THE FUTURE.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.500
>> Bill: IN ASIA.

19:35.566 --> 19:35.833
WITH US?

19:35.900 --> 19:38.366
>> BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA,

19:38.433 --> 19:39.200
ABSOLUTELY.

19:39.266 --> 19:39.566
>> Bill: REALLY?

19:39.633 --> 19:43.133
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE -- I THINK

19:43.200 --> 19:44.566
BOTH COUNTRIES NO --

19:44.633 --> 19:46.366
>> THEY BOTH KNOW, BUT HERE'S

19:46.433 --> 19:46.966
THE ISSUE.

19:47.033 --> 19:48.700
IT IS A BIT LIKE THE START OF

19:48.766 --> 19:50.166
WORLD WAR I, AND THAT IS THE

19:50.233 --> 19:50.800
HISTORICAL MEMORY THAT WORRY SO

19:50.866 --> 19:51.866
MANY PEOPLE IN THE PENTAGON,

19:51.933 --> 19:53.800
BECAUSE YOU GO BACK TO THE

19:53.866 --> 19:55.300
COLD WAR, BETWEEN THE U.S. AND

19:55.366 --> 19:56.433
THE SOVIET UNION, AND YOU HAD A

19:56.500 --> 19:58.166
HOT LINE BETWEEN THE TWO

19:58.233 --> 19:59.600
COUNTRIES, THEY COULD TALK

19:59.666 --> 19:59.933
PRETTY EASILY.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.533
THE PROBLEM TODAY THAT PEOPLE

20:01.600 --> 20:03.933
AREN'T TALKING ENOUGH IS

20:04.000 --> 20:05.500
ACTUALLY THE HOTLINE BETWEEN

20:05.566 --> 20:06.366
WASHINGTON AND BEIJING IS PRETTY

20:06.433 --> 20:06.666
BROKEN.

20:06.733 --> 20:08.766
AND THAT AS A BACKDROP WHICH

20:08.833 --> 20:09.666
MADE PEOPLE LIKE GENERAL MILLEY

20:09.733 --> 20:11.066
SO CONCERNED, THAT YOU COULD

20:11.133 --> 20:11.700
HAVE AN ACCIDENT LIKE THE

20:11.766 --> 20:15.533
BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR I, AND

20:15.600 --> 20:16.766
SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING WILL SPIN

20:16.833 --> 20:17.200
OUT OF CONTROL.

20:17.266 --> 20:18.633
>> Bill: YES.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.266
WELL, C, THIS IS WHY I DON'T EAT

20:21.333 --> 20:22.633
POT ANYMORE, BECAUSE --

20:22.700 --> 20:22.900
[LAUGHTER]

20:22.966 --> 20:23.833
THEY MADE ME PARANOID.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.333
AND THEN I WOULD HAVE TO TELL

20:26.400 --> 20:27.233
MYSELF, YES, ANYTHING BAD THING

20:27.300 --> 20:29.200
COULD HAPPEN.

20:29.266 --> 20:30.533
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I EAT

20:30.600 --> 20:31.066
POT.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.866
I ONLY THINK ABOUT WHAT BAD

20:32.933 --> 20:33.800
COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.833
I THINK THIS COULD POSSIBLY

20:35.900 --> 20:36.600
HAPPEN.

20:36.666 --> 20:37.900
I DON'T -- THAT'S NOT EVEN

20:37.966 --> 20:40.866
NUMBER TEN OF MY LIST.

20:40.933 --> 20:42.833
I'M SO MUCH MORE WORRIED ABOUT

20:42.900 --> 20:43.400
THE ENVIRONMENT AND NEVER --

20:43.466 --> 20:46.333
[APPLAUSE]

20:46.400 --> 20:50.066
>> YOU SUPPORT WHAT MILLEY DID

20:50.133 --> 20:50.633
QUESTION WORK >> Bill:

20:50.700 --> 20:50.933
TOTALLY!

20:51.000 --> 20:53.633
>> ESPECIALLY AFTER JANUARY 6TH,

20:53.700 --> 20:55.366
MILLEY TOOK AN OATH TO DEFEND

20:55.433 --> 20:56.333
THE CONSTITUTION, HE DID NOT

20:56.400 --> 20:58.400
TAKE AN OATH TO DONALD FUCKING

20:58.466 --> 21:00.633
TRUMP, AND WHAT TRUMP APPROVED

21:00.700 --> 21:02.066
ON JANUARY 6TH, HE WAS TRYING TO

21:02.133 --> 21:02.633
DESTROY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

21:02.700 --> 21:06.000
ORDER, SHRED THE CONSTITUTION,

21:06.066 --> 21:06.666
PREVENT THE CONSTITUTIONAL

21:06.733 --> 21:08.200
MECHANISMS WERE OPERATING THAT

21:08.266 --> 21:09.666
WOULD REPLACE HIM AS PRESIDENT.

21:09.733 --> 21:11.366
TRUMP WENT TO WAR WITH THE

21:11.433 --> 21:12.800
CONSTITUTION ON JANUARY 6TH, SO

21:12.866 --> 21:14.666
WHAT MILLEY DID EARLY WAS

21:14.733 --> 21:16.000
PRECEDENTS, AND AFTER

21:16.066 --> 21:16.933
JANUARY 6TH WAS

21:17.000 --> 21:17.433
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.533
>> Bill: YES, I TOTALLY AGREE

21:18.600 --> 21:19.966
WITH THAT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

21:20.033 --> 21:20.833
TODAY WE FOUND OUT ANTHONY

21:20.900 --> 21:21.833
GONZALEZ, NEVER HEARD OF HIM,

21:21.900 --> 21:23.900
BUT HE IS A REPUBLICAN

21:23.966 --> 21:25.600
CONGRESSMAN FROM OHIO, HE WAS

21:25.666 --> 21:28.366
ONE OF THE TEN REPUBLICANS WHO

21:28.433 --> 21:29.966
VOTED TO IMPEACH TRUMP BEFORE

21:30.033 --> 21:30.366
JANUARY 6TH.

21:30.433 --> 21:34.433
HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN IN 2022.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.966
BECAUSE HE IS NOT GOING TO WIN.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.600
HE'S NOT EVEN GOING TO ENACT THE

21:37.666 --> 21:38.133
PRIMARY.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.266
HE KNOWS THAT.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.300
BECAUSE THIS PARTY IS ALL IN.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.866
THEY ARE A ONE ISSUE PARTY,

21:42.933 --> 21:44.433
VOTING, THEY ARE AGAINST IT,

21:44.500 --> 21:45.366
THEY COULD GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ALL

21:45.433 --> 21:48.133
THEIR TRADITIONAL IDEAS LIKE

21:48.200 --> 21:48.800
BALANCE THE BUDGET.

21:48.866 --> 21:49.500
THEY ARE ABOUT AS MUCH CONCERNED

21:49.566 --> 21:53.833
ABOUT THAT AS THEY ARE THE NEW

21:53.900 --> 21:54.866
SEASON OF

21:54.933 --> 21:56.233
"RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE."

21:56.300 --> 21:57.866
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING

21:57.933 --> 21:59.566
EXCEPT THIS ONE ISSUE.

21:59.633 --> 22:01.033
>> REMEMBER PERSONAL REALITY?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.700
SEXUAL MORALITY WAS SUCH A BIG

22:02.766 --> 22:03.266
ISSUE WITH REPUBLICANS.

22:03.333 --> 22:07.066
THEY SPENT 30 YEARS OF MY LIFE,

22:07.133 --> 22:08.033
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO SLAP THE

22:08.100 --> 22:10.000
DICK OUT OF MY MOUTH, AND THEN

22:10.066 --> 22:10.966
REVEAL THEMSELVES WITH TRUMP TO

22:11.033 --> 22:12.866
NOT GIVE ONE FLYING FUCKING SHIT

22:12.933 --> 22:14.700
ABOUT SEXUAL MORALITY OR

22:14.766 --> 22:15.100
RESPONSIBILITY.

22:15.166 --> 22:15.700
>> BASICALLY ALL THE REPUBLIC

22:15.766 --> 22:17.500
AND THEY'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW,

22:17.566 --> 22:19.933
WHAT GENERAL MILLEY DID WAS

22:20.000 --> 22:20.333
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.433
IF THEY SPENT ONE-TENTH THE

22:21.500 --> 22:22.600
AMOUNT OF ENERGY WORRYING ABOUT

22:22.666 --> 22:23.233
WHETHER TRUMP WAS ACTING IN A

22:23.300 --> 22:26.133
CONSTITUTIONAL WAY, THEY WOULD

22:26.200 --> 22:26.933
HAVE A LIBERAL CREDIBILITY RIGHT

22:27.000 --> 22:27.566
NOW, TO GO BACK TO YOUR POINT.

22:27.633 --> 22:31.000
[APPLAUSE]

22:31.066 --> 22:34.000
>> I MEAN, MILLEY -- I AM NOT AN

22:34.066 --> 22:35.233
EXPERT, BUT MILLEY SEEMS TO HAVE

22:35.300 --> 22:36.333
BEEN IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.833
HE TOOK AN OATH TO DEFEND THE

22:38.900 --> 22:40.366
CONSTITUTION.

22:40.433 --> 22:41.300
THE PRESIDENT WAS THE ENEMY ON

22:41.366 --> 22:42.333
THE CONSTITUTION.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.366
>> Bill: RIGHT, EXACTLY.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.000
>> WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

22:45.066 --> 22:46.833
>> AND THE POINT IS, YOU SAY YOU

22:46.900 --> 22:48.566
WANT TO SMOKE POT AND NOT WORRY

22:48.633 --> 22:49.833
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.133
WELL, WE WANT GENERALS WHO WORRY

22:51.200 --> 22:52.566
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

22:52.633 --> 22:54.566
THAT IS THEIR JOB, TO TRY TO

22:54.633 --> 22:54.966
STAVE OFF THREATS.

22:55.033 --> 22:57.600
[APPLAUSE]

22:57.666 --> 22:58.866
>> Bill: I SAID I DON'T EAT

22:58.933 --> 23:00.433
IT.

23:00.500 --> 23:00.800
[LAUGHTER]

23:00.866 --> 23:01.900
I DIDN'T SAY I'M NOT GOING TO

23:01.966 --> 23:02.600
SMOKE IT.

23:02.666 --> 23:04.700
I'M GOING TO SMOKE A LOT OF IT.

23:04.766 --> 23:05.900
OKAY, SO -- [LAUGHS]

23:05.966 --> 23:09.133
GOOD NEWS.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.000
WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH

23:11.066 --> 23:12.900
POVERTY IN THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE

23:12.966 --> 23:13.500
OF THE PANDEMIC.

23:13.566 --> 23:16.133
BECAUSE SO MUCH GOVERNMENT

23:16.200 --> 23:17.033
LARGESS WENT TO LIFT PEOPLE UP,

23:17.100 --> 23:19.200
AND WE ARE NOT IN SUCH BAD SHAPE

23:19.266 --> 23:20.033
ANYMORE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE.

23:20.100 --> 23:23.233
HOWEVER, HOMELESSNESS ROSE 40%

23:23.300 --> 23:24.533
IN THE STATE IN FIVE YEARS.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.000
WE HAVE HAVE ALL THE HOMELESS IN

23:26.066 --> 23:26.466
THE COUNTRY.

23:26.533 --> 23:28.900
BUT THERE'S OVER 500,000 PEOPLE

23:28.966 --> 23:31.433
WHO ARE HOMELESS.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.600
WHEN THEY ASKED CALIFORNIANS IN

23:33.666 --> 23:35.200
EXIT POLLS AFTER THE RECALL THIS

23:35.266 --> 23:36.900
WEEK, WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER ONE

23:36.966 --> 23:38.433
ISSUE?

23:38.500 --> 23:38.833
COVID, 32%.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.600
THAT MAKES SENSE.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.366
SECOND, NOT THE ECONOMY, NOT

23:42.433 --> 23:44.600
CRIME, HOMELESSNESS.

23:44.666 --> 23:45.433
I UNDERSTAND.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.133
IT IS ON PEOPLE'S DOORSTEPS.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.333
WHEN SAN FRANCISCO, THEY HAVE AN

23:49.400 --> 23:52.333
APP CALLED "NAP CRAP."

23:52.400 --> 23:54.266
WHERE YOU CAN REQUEST SIDEWALK

23:54.333 --> 23:56.500
CLEANING.

23:56.566 --> 23:59.933
BECAUSE THERE IS FECES.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.233
>> THE SAME CALIFORNIANS THAT

24:03.300 --> 24:04.633
TELL POLLSTERS COME HOMELESSNESS

24:04.700 --> 24:06.066
THE SECOND TOP ISSUE, ASK THE

24:06.133 --> 24:08.466
SAME CALIFORNIANS IF YOU CONDONE

24:08.533 --> 24:10.433
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING IN THEIR

24:10.500 --> 24:11.800
NEIGHBORHOOD, BUILD APARTMENT

24:11.866 --> 24:12.100
BUILDINGS --

24:12.166 --> 24:13.200
>> Bill: WELL, NOW IT IS A

24:13.266 --> 24:13.366
LAW.

24:13.433 --> 24:14.533
>> THE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IS

24:14.600 --> 24:17.166
A LACK OF HOUSING SUPPLY AND IT

24:17.233 --> 24:19.333
IS DRIVING UP PRICES BECAUSE OF

24:19.400 --> 24:20.800
SCARCITY OF HOUSING, AND THAT IS

24:20.866 --> 24:21.933
MAKING PEOPLE HOMELESS, AND THE

24:22.000 --> 24:23.300
SAME PEOPLE WHO PUT A SIGN IN

24:23.366 --> 24:24.966
THEIR FRONT YARD SAYING "IN THIS

24:25.033 --> 24:27.166
HOUSE, WE BELIEVE NO ONE SHOULD

24:27.233 --> 24:28.766
BE HOMELESS" WILL MURDER THEIR

24:28.833 --> 24:30.000
REPRESENTATIVES, YOU KNOW, THEIR

24:30.066 --> 24:32.433
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, IF THEY

24:32.500 --> 24:33.466
REZONE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD TO

24:33.533 --> 24:34.866
BUILD MORE HOUSING FOR THESE

24:34.933 --> 24:35.466
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS.

24:35.533 --> 24:37.933
>> THERE IS A WORD FOR IT.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.433
NOT IN MY BACKYARD.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.766
YOU HAVE TO STOP AND ASK

24:41.833 --> 24:44.533
YOURSELF, WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

24:44.600 --> 24:46.566
DID YOU SEE HOMELESSNESS AROUND

24:46.633 --> 24:47.166
YOU?

24:47.233 --> 24:48.733
>> Bill: DID I SEE?

24:48.800 --> 24:48.966
>> WHY?

24:49.033 --> 24:50.833
THAT IS A QUESTION WE SHOULD

24:50.900 --> 24:52.333
ASK, THERE WAS NOT HOMELESSNESS

24:52.400 --> 24:53.366
50 YEARS AGO, 40 YEARS AGO, AND

24:53.433 --> 24:55.833
IT IS SIMPLE, IT IS NOT ROCKET

24:55.900 --> 24:58.033
SCIENCE, BASICALLY, A GREAT

24:58.100 --> 25:01.166
SURVEY SHOWED AS SOON AS YOU

25:01.233 --> 25:01.733
HAVE COMMUNITY SPENDING MORE

25:01.800 --> 25:03.933
THAN A THIRD OF THEIR WAGES ON

25:04.000 --> 25:06.233
RENTAL COSTS OR HOME COSTS, YOU

25:06.300 --> 25:07.633
START TO SEE HOMELESSNESS RISE.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.566
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE

25:09.633 --> 25:10.166
HOUSING.

25:10.233 --> 25:11.166
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH

25:11.233 --> 25:12.966
ABILITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

25:13.033 --> 25:13.466
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA.

25:13.533 --> 25:15.466
AND SO THE TYPE OF MEASURE THE

25:15.533 --> 25:17.066
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES RIGHT NOW,

25:17.133 --> 25:19.266
FRANKLY, ARE TOO LITTLE, TOO

25:19.333 --> 25:19.633
LATE.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.333
>> Bill: WELL, YES, IT IS

25:21.400 --> 25:22.766
ALSO, LAST WEEK I WAS TALKING

25:22.833 --> 25:24.066
ABOUT WHY CAN'T WE PIPE WATER

25:24.133 --> 25:26.833
FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST?

25:26.900 --> 25:27.700
THERE IS TOO MUCH WATER IN THE

25:27.766 --> 25:27.933
EAST --

25:28.000 --> 25:30.500
[APPLAUSE]

25:30.566 --> 25:32.366
YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOKED INTO

25:32.433 --> 25:35.133
THIS, IT'S NOT THAT WE CAN'T.

25:35.200 --> 25:35.800
IT'S FEASIBLE.

25:35.866 --> 25:37.466
WE'VE HEARD FOR DECADES -- IT'S

25:37.533 --> 25:38.266
NOT ONLY UNFEASIBLE BECAUSE WE

25:38.333 --> 25:40.200
DON'T WANT TO DO IT, BECAUSE OF

25:40.266 --> 25:41.400
GRAFT.

25:41.466 --> 25:43.033
THAT IS REALLY THE BASIC REASON

25:43.100 --> 25:43.366
WHY.

25:43.433 --> 25:45.066
BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST COST SO

25:45.133 --> 25:46.666
MUCH IN PAYING OFF ALL THE

25:46.733 --> 25:48.200
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND ALL THE

25:48.266 --> 25:48.900
BULLSHIT INVOLVED WITH GETTING

25:48.966 --> 25:50.800
ANYTHING DONE, AND IT IS THE

25:50.866 --> 25:52.200
SAME THING WITH HOUSING.

25:52.266 --> 25:54.366
THIS STATE PUT ASIDE $12 BILLION

25:54.433 --> 25:55.866
TO SOLVE THE HOUSING PROBLEM.

25:55.933 --> 25:58.200
YOU COULDN'T BUILD BARRACKS AND

25:58.266 --> 26:00.933
HIRE ENOUGH SECURITY GUARDS AND

26:01.000 --> 26:04.700
DOCTORS, BY THE WAY, INSIDE

26:04.766 --> 26:05.800
BARRACKS?

26:05.866 --> 26:06.766
THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

26:06.833 --> 26:07.833
SO IF YOU ARE ON THE STREET,

26:07.900 --> 26:09.433
COME INSIDE.

26:09.500 --> 26:13.500
IT'S NOT THE RITZ, BUT YOU HAVE

26:13.566 --> 26:16.633
A COT AND THREE MEALS, FOR

26:16.700 --> 26:16.933
$12 BILLION?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.833
OF COURSE WE COULD.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.566
IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T EVEN

26:21.633 --> 26:22.233
START.

26:22.300 --> 26:22.766
BECAUSE --

26:22.833 --> 26:24.900
>> IT IS ALSO THIS ISSUE ABOUT

26:24.966 --> 26:27.600
EMPATHY AND TRIBALISM AND

26:27.666 --> 26:29.000
WHETHER AMERICA FEELS A SENSE OF

26:29.066 --> 26:30.966
COMMUNITY OR NOT, BECAUSE

26:31.033 --> 26:31.833
NIMBYISM IS BASICALLY DRIVEN BY

26:31.900 --> 26:32.466
THE SENSE PEOPLE WANT TO DEFEND

26:32.533 --> 26:35.333
WHAT THEY HAVE AND KEEP OUT

26:35.400 --> 26:36.000
EVERY ONE ELSE.

26:36.066 --> 26:37.766
THE PROBLEM WITH THE HOMELESS IS

26:37.833 --> 26:39.366
YOU CAN'T, YOU TRIP OVER THEM IN

26:39.433 --> 26:40.333
THE STREET.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.900
EVEN IF YOU ARE AN ELITE PERSON

26:42.000 --> 26:42.800
IN SAN FRANCISCO OR LOS ANGELES.

26:42.866 --> 26:44.800
AND THE QUESTION I GUESS IS HOW

26:44.866 --> 26:46.933
DOES AMERICA OVERCOME THE SENSE

26:47.000 --> 26:48.833
OF TRIBALISM, OF NIMBYISM, I'M

26:48.900 --> 26:49.866
JUST PROTECTING THEIR LITTLE

26:49.933 --> 26:50.066
PATCH?

26:50.133 --> 26:50.900
>> THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

26:50.966 --> 26:52.633
A CRAM DOWN TO BUILD HOUSES.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.233
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

26:54.300 --> 26:55.400
EAT IT.

26:55.466 --> 26:57.466
AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE

26:57.533 --> 27:03.333
TERRIFIED OF PISSING OFF THE

27:03.400 --> 27:05.100
NIMBYS.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.233
INCREASINGLY ORGANIZED, PEOPLE

27:07.300 --> 27:08.333
ARE GOING TO PUBLIC HEARINGS TO

27:08.400 --> 27:12.333
TESTIFY NOW AND SAY YES, PLEASE,

27:12.400 --> 27:12.933
REZONE MY NEIGHBORHOOD, PLEASE

27:13.000 --> 27:13.266
BUILD HOUSES.

27:13.333 --> 27:13.900
>> Bill: AND NOW IT IS THE

27:13.966 --> 27:14.600
LAW.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.666
THAT IS WHAT NEWSOM DID TODAY.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.966
>> SO HE IS A IMBY.

27:20.033 --> 27:21.066
>> Bill: YES.

27:21.133 --> 27:22.066
[APPLAUSE]

27:22.133 --> 27:23.466
>> DEMOCRAT OF SAN FRANCISCO WHO

27:23.533 --> 27:26.000
PUSHED THAT LAW.

27:26.066 --> 27:28.000
>> Bill: GOT?

27:28.066 --> 27:28.400
>> SCOTT.

27:28.466 --> 27:30.400
HE PUSHED THAT LAW.

27:30.466 --> 27:35.066
I WANT TO DROP HIS NAME.

27:35.133 --> 27:43.000
>> Bill: WHICH IS WIENER.

27:43.066 --> 27:44.333
YOU TALK ABOUT TRIBALISM, I

27:44.400 --> 27:45.400
DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS TRIBALISM

27:45.466 --> 27:47.000
BUT I LOOKED AT THE PICTURES

27:47.066 --> 27:47.966
FROM THE MET GALA, YOU KNOW, AND

27:48.033 --> 27:51.000
WE ARE GOING TO GET TO AOC, SHE

27:51.066 --> 27:54.466
WORE "TAX THE RICH" ON HER DRES

27:54.533 --> 27:54.666
DRESS.

27:54.733 --> 27:56.000
I NOTICED SOMETHING THAT I'VE

27:56.066 --> 27:58.266
SEEN, HAVING BEEN OUT A FEW

27:58.333 --> 27:59.366
PARTIES.

27:59.433 --> 28:00.366
SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN.

28:00.433 --> 28:01.700
AND THAT IS, THE PEOPLE GOING TO

28:01.766 --> 28:04.266
THE PARTY DON'T WEAR MASKS.

28:04.333 --> 28:07.766
BUT THE SERVERS WERE MASKS.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.300
YEAH, LOOK AT THIS.

28:09.366 --> 28:11.933
I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT

28:12.000 --> 28:14.766
THIS THAT'S NOT LIBERAL TO ME.

28:14.833 --> 28:15.900
I MEAN, THESE ARE THE LIBERAL

28:15.966 --> 28:18.466
SWELLS OF THE WORLD, BUT IF WE

28:18.533 --> 28:23.133
ARE ALL VACCINATED, DO THE GERMS

28:23.200 --> 28:23.733
KNOW WHO THE GOOD PEOPLE ARE?

28:23.800 --> 28:24.000
[LAUGHTER]

28:24.066 --> 28:26.000
[APPLAUSE]

28:26.066 --> 28:26.900
IT JUST SEEMS -- IT SEEMS A

28:26.966 --> 28:28.633
LITTLE LONG.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.566
WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THIS,

28:30.633 --> 28:31.033
PEOPLE?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.300
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY

28:32.366 --> 28:34.966
PUSHBACK FROM ME.

28:35.033 --> 28:37.366
IT SEEMS A LITTLE SECURITY

28:37.433 --> 28:40.266
THEATERY,'S AROUND THE MASKS, BT

28:40.333 --> 28:41.666
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, IF IT REDUCES

28:41.733 --> 28:45.333
THE CHANCE BY 25%, THEN SOMEBODY

28:45.400 --> 28:47.166
MAY HAVE BEEN INFECTED --

28:47.233 --> 28:48.933
>> Bill: LET'S JUST MAKE THE

28:49.000 --> 28:49.700
HELP WHERE THE MASKS?

28:49.766 --> 28:52.900
THAT'S THE LIBERAL APPROACH?

28:52.966 --> 28:54.200
THAT DOESN'T SEEM SOUND.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.000
>> NOT AT ALL, AND WE HAVE TO

28:56.066 --> 28:57.566
REALIZE, I AM TRAINED AS AN

28:57.633 --> 28:58.166
ANTHROPOLOGIST AND JOURNALIST,

28:58.233 --> 29:00.400
SO I REALLY CARE A LOT ABOUT

29:00.466 --> 29:02.800
SYMBOLS, AND THE KIND OF SIGNALS

29:02.866 --> 29:03.866
THEY SEND.

29:03.933 --> 29:04.500
UNFORTUNATELY, AMERICA IS SO

29:04.566 --> 29:06.866
TRIBAL THAT WEARING A MASK HAS

29:06.933 --> 29:08.333
BECOME ALMOST A TRIBAL SYMBOL --

29:08.400 --> 29:09.066
>> Bill: RIGHT, AND IT IS

29:09.133 --> 29:11.866
OFTEN AN AMULET.

29:11.933 --> 29:13.933
>> THERE IS A BODY OF RESEARCH

29:14.000 --> 29:15.100
THAT SHOWS THAT THEY DO WORK.

29:15.166 --> 29:16.966
>> Bill: YES, OF COURSE, THAT

29:17.033 --> 29:19.000
IS WHY SURGEONS WEAR THEM.

29:19.066 --> 29:20.400
NOT IN EVERY SITUATION.

29:20.466 --> 29:22.300
I SEE THE SAN FRANCISCO MARATHON

29:22.366 --> 29:22.866
IS GOING TO MAKE THE RUNNERS

29:22.933 --> 29:25.733
WEAR THE MASKS.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.433
NOW THAT IS JUST POWERFUL

29:28.500 --> 29:28.666
STUPID.

29:28.733 --> 29:28.933
[LAUGHTER]

29:29.033 --> 29:29.833
[APPLAUSE]

29:29.900 --> 29:32.600
ON EVERY LEVEL.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.433
>> THAT DOES SEEM TRIBAL.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.833
THAT DOES SEEM KIND OF LIKE

29:35.900 --> 29:36.233
VIRTUE SIGNALING.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.800
BUT THEY ARE -- I WISH WE COULD

29:38.866 --> 29:39.900
HAVE A CRITIQUE OF MASKS THAT

29:39.966 --> 29:42.633
DIDN'T GO TO A PLACE WHERE THEN

29:42.700 --> 29:45.000
PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO WEAR MASKS

29:45.066 --> 29:46.700
ON AIRPLANES AND A SALT FLIGHT

29:46.766 --> 29:46.966
ATTENDANTS.

29:47.033 --> 29:48.866
WE EMPHASIZE, EVEN AS WEAK

29:48.933 --> 29:49.166
CRITIQUE --

29:49.233 --> 29:50.433
>> Bill: THEN DON'T LIE AND DO

29:50.500 --> 29:52.233
STUPID STUFF WITH THEM.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.200
>> THAT THEY WORK.

29:53.266 --> 29:55.066
>> Bill: DON'T LIE AND THEN

29:55.133 --> 29:55.633
PEOPLE WILL HAVE MORE TRUST.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.500
[APPLAUSE]

29:58.566 --> 30:00.366
>> OKAY, BUT LET'S TALK --

30:00.433 --> 30:00.566
SORRY.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.466
>> ONE THING I WROTE ABOUT IN MY

30:02.533 --> 30:04.266
BOOK, ACTUALLY, MASKS AREN'T

30:04.333 --> 30:04.833
JUST ABOUT MEDICAL SCIENCE.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.533
THEY DON'T JUST STOP GERMS.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.500
THE ACT OF PUTTING ON A MASK

30:09.566 --> 30:10.600
EACH DAY IS LIKE A PSYCHOLOGICAL

30:10.666 --> 30:12.533
PROMPT TO REMIND YOU TO CHANGE

30:12.600 --> 30:13.533
BEHAVIOR, AND IT IS ALSO A

30:13.600 --> 30:14.633
CULTURAL SIGNAL THAT YOU UPHOLD

30:14.700 --> 30:15.700
THE VALUES OF THE COMMUNITY AND

30:15.766 --> 30:17.866
HAVE SOME SENSE OF

30:17.933 --> 30:18.533
RESPONSIBILITY TO EVERYONE ELSE.

30:18.600 --> 30:26.300
[APPLAUSE]

30:26.366 --> 30:28.700
>> IT IS ALSO ASSHOLE SIGNALING,

30:28.766 --> 30:29.233
NOT JUST VIRTUE SIGNALING.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.233
I GOT A PLANE TO COME HERE AND

30:30.300 --> 30:31.666
THERE WAS SOME GUY NOT WEARING A

30:31.733 --> 30:34.633
MASK, THAT IS IN ASSHOLE.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.200
[APPLAUSE]

30:37.266 --> 30:38.933
>> I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.333
I THINK PICTURES OF LIBERAL

30:40.400 --> 30:41.133
CELEBRITIES NOT WEARING MASKS

30:41.200 --> 30:42.466
NEXT TO HELP THAT ARE WEARING

30:42.533 --> 30:45.000
MASKS, SERVERS WERE WEARING

30:45.066 --> 30:47.166
MASKS, DOES NOT SEND THE RIGHT

30:47.233 --> 30:48.200
SIGNAL ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY.

30:48.266 --> 30:49.566
>> Bill: I ALSO WANT TO SHOW

30:49.633 --> 30:50.400
THE PICTURE OF AOC WEARING HER

30:50.466 --> 30:51.200
DRESS BECAUSE THIS GOT ALL THE

30:51.266 --> 30:54.333
ATTENTION THIS WEEK.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.666
MRS. SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, THE

30:56.733 --> 30:57.533
MET GALA ATTRACTS LOTS OF

30:57.600 --> 30:57.866
CRAZY OUTFITS

30:57.933 --> 30:59.366
BUT THIS IS A NEW THING PEOPLE

30:59.433 --> 31:00.300
HAVE BEEN DOING, THEY HAVE BEEN

31:00.366 --> 31:03.733
WEARING, I GUESS THEIR

31:03.800 --> 31:05.433
MESSAGE, LIFE PHILOSOPHY, TAX

31:05.500 --> 31:08.433
THE RICH, I HAD SOME SETS

31:08.500 --> 31:10.600
HERE.

31:10.666 --> 31:11.600
NEW YORK CITY, 65,000, THE

31:11.666 --> 31:13.100
RICHEST 65,000 NEW YORKERS COME

31:13.166 --> 31:14.266
OUT OF 8 MILLION PEOPLE, PAY 51%

31:14.333 --> 31:17.966
OF TAXES.

31:18.033 --> 31:19.600
>> AND WHAT PROPORTION IS THAT?

31:19.666 --> 31:23.200
>> Bill: I'M JUST SAYING,

31:23.266 --> 31:23.966
65000 OUT OF 8000000 PAY HALF,

31:24.033 --> 31:24.833
SO IT IS NOT LIKE WE DON'T TAX

31:24.900 --> 31:27.566
THE RICH AT ALL.

31:27.633 --> 31:29.200
>> WE HAVE BEEN SLASHING TAXES

31:29.266 --> 31:30.300
ON THE RICH FOR 50 YEARS,

31:30.366 --> 31:31.700
THOUGH, THE RICH ARE RICHER NOW

31:31.766 --> 31:32.933
THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN IN THE

31:33.000 --> 31:34.600
LIE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THE WHOLE

31:34.666 --> 31:35.266
TIME YOU'RE CUTTING TAXES ON THE

31:35.333 --> 31:36.200
RICHS THAT THE RICH HAVE THE

31:36.266 --> 31:38.166
MOST MONEY THEY CAN POSSIBLY

31:38.233 --> 31:39.766
HAVE, WE WILL ALL BENEFIT, ALL

31:39.833 --> 31:41.666
HAVE JOBS, BUT IT IS A LIE AND

31:41.733 --> 31:42.666
IT HASN'T COME TRUE AND WE NEED

31:42.733 --> 31:45.733
TO GO BACK TO THE HIGH TAX

31:45.800 --> 31:46.033
REGISTRY --

31:46.100 --> 31:46.300
[APPLAUSE]

31:46.366 --> 31:50.766
>> Bill: THAT'S FINE.

31:50.833 --> 31:51.600
BUT LET'S NOT LIVE.

31:51.666 --> 31:53.033
THE RICH PAY A LOT OF THE TAXES.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.366
>> YES, BECAUSE GUESS WHAT?

31:56.433 --> 31:59.100
THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER.

31:59.166 --> 32:01.600
I KNOW WE ARE LIKE THE REBELS AT

32:01.666 --> 32:07.166
"BREAKFAST CLUB," HE IS THE GEE

32:07.233 --> 32:07.366
GEEK.

32:07.433 --> 32:08.366
MONETARY POLICY HAS MASSIVELY

32:08.433 --> 32:09.933
INFLATED THE ASSETS OF EVERYBODY

32:10.000 --> 32:11.733
WHO IS WEALTHY, AND BY GAP

32:11.800 --> 32:13.033
BETWEEN RICH AND POOR HAS BEEN

32:13.100 --> 32:14.433
RISING AND RISING, SO IT IS NOT

32:14.500 --> 32:16.700
SURPRISING THAT THE RICH ARE

32:16.766 --> 32:19.633
PAYING A LARGE CHUNK OF THE

32:19.700 --> 32:20.000
TASK.

32:20.066 --> 32:22.633
>> IF YOU WANT TO BUILD THE

32:22.700 --> 32:23.133
PIPELINE FROM EAST COAST

32:23.200 --> 32:27.133
WEST COAST, YOU DON'T TAX THE

32:27.200 --> 32:27.433
HELP.

32:27.500 --> 32:31.366
THEY PAY A HIGHER PROPORTION OF

32:31.433 --> 32:32.866
INCOME TAX THAN JEFF BEZOS DOES.

32:32.933 --> 32:33.866
>> Bill: HIS COMPANY DOES,

32:33.933 --> 32:34.500
YES.

32:34.566 --> 32:35.166
YES, THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE

32:35.233 --> 32:37.966
NEED TO AMEND ABOUT THE

32:38.033 --> 32:39.333
CAPITALIST SYSTEM.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.633
WE HAVE CRONY CAPITALISM IN THIS

32:40.700 --> 32:40.866
COUNTRY.

32:40.933 --> 32:41.266
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

32:41.333 --> 32:45.566
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU WEAR YOUR

32:45.633 --> 32:46.933
"TAX THE RICH" ON YOUR ASS AND

32:47.000 --> 32:48.400
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAYING THE

32:48.466 --> 32:50.233
RICH DON'T PAY TAXES, THEY PAY

32:50.300 --> 32:51.000
SOME TAXES.

32:51.066 --> 32:52.633
THEY PAY A BIG PART OF THE

32:52.700 --> 32:53.100
FREIGHT ALREADY.

32:53.166 --> 32:55.066
I'M NOT SAYING IT SHOULDN'T BE

32:55.133 --> 32:55.866
MORE, PERHAPS, BUT LET'S NOT

32:55.933 --> 32:56.233
LIVE.

32:56.300 --> 32:58.300
NOW, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME

32:58.366 --> 32:59.966
OTHER DRESSES THAT PEOPLE WERE

33:00.033 --> 33:01.366
WEARING AT THE MET GALA, NOW

33:01.433 --> 33:03.666
THAT THIS IS A THING, TO WEAR

33:03.733 --> 33:06.400
YOUR SLOGAN ON YOUR ASS.

33:06.466 --> 33:08.566
OPRAH WAS THERE AND SHE WORE A

33:08.633 --> 33:10.700
DRESS CALLED "IGNORE PREVIOUS

33:10.766 --> 33:10.933
DRESS."

33:11.000 --> 33:11.200
[LAUGHTER]

33:11.266 --> 33:19.333
[APPLAUSE]

33:19.400 --> 33:20.900
CAITLYN JENNER WORE "I STILL

33:20.966 --> 33:24.800
LIKE ATTENDING BALLS."

33:24.866 --> 33:25.433
SCARLETT JOHANSSON HAD "TAX THE

33:25.500 --> 33:27.900
RICH, MAINLY DISNEY."

33:27.966 --> 33:28.166
[LAUGHTER]

33:28.233 --> 33:30.900
[APPLAUSE]

33:30.966 --> 33:31.500
NICKI MINAJ HAD "ASK ME ABOUT

33:31.566 --> 33:35.633
IVERMECTIN."

33:35.700 --> 33:39.100
[LAUGHTER]

33:39.166 --> 33:40.200
BRITNEY SPEARS WAS THERE.

33:40.266 --> 33:45.633
"MY DAD PICKED OUT THIS DRESS."

33:45.700 --> 33:46.200
MELANIA WAS THERE: "EAT THE

33:46.266 --> 33:48.700
POOR."

33:48.766 --> 33:50.066
OKAY.

33:50.133 --> 33:50.900
LORI LOUGHLIN HAD "GET INTO ANY

33:50.966 --> 33:53.833
COLLEGE, ASK ME HOW."

33:53.900 --> 33:57.666
[LAUGHTER]

33:57.733 --> 33:59.000
AND IVANKA WAS THERE: "SOMEONE

33:59.066 --> 34:02.766
PLEASE TALK TO ME."

34:02.833 --> 34:03.866
THAT WAS HER DRESS.

34:03.933 --> 34:04.133
ALL RIGHT.

34:04.200 --> 34:09.733
[APPLAUSE]

34:09.800 --> 34:12.233
SO, LET ME READ SOMETHING ELSE

34:12.300 --> 34:13.400
AOC WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS WEEK

34:13.466 --> 34:15.333
WHICH WAS HER SERIES OF TWEETS

34:15.400 --> 34:16.233
ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE THAT IS

34:16.300 --> 34:17.900
THE BIG STORY THAT HAS HAPPENED

34:17.966 --> 34:19.266
IN TEXAS, OF COURSE, BUT ALL THE

34:19.333 --> 34:21.733
COUNTRY IS WATCHING THIS BECAUSE

34:21.800 --> 34:23.833
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN, I THINK,

34:23.900 --> 34:25.700
THE GREAT MOTIVATING ISSUE IN

34:25.766 --> 34:27.133
ELECTIONS IN THE LAST MANY

34:27.200 --> 34:27.866
DECADES, FOR WOMEN.

34:27.933 --> 34:30.700
I MEAN, WE HAVE OFTEN HEARD THE

34:30.766 --> 34:33.833
PHRASE "IF MEN COULD GET

34:33.900 --> 34:34.166
PREGNANT."

34:34.233 --> 34:37.200
WELL, AOC SAYS THE GUTTING OF

34:37.266 --> 34:37.766
ROE VS. WADE IMPERILS EVERY

34:37.833 --> 34:41.166
MENSTRUATING PERSON IN THE U.S.

34:41.233 --> 34:43.100
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, MAYBE JUST

34:43.166 --> 34:44.966
SAYING "WOMEN," BUT OKAY.

34:45.033 --> 34:46.666
I'M WILLING TO ALWAYS LISTEN.

34:46.733 --> 34:49.100
SHE SAID "JUST ONE REASON ROE

34:49.166 --> 34:50.966
ISN'T A WOMAN'S ISSUE, PEOPLE

34:51.033 --> 34:52.666
WHO AREN'T WOMEN CAN MENSTRUATE,

34:52.733 --> 34:55.433
TOO."

34:55.500 --> 34:58.966
DUH.

34:59.033 --> 35:00.866
TRANS, TO SPIRIT, AND NONBINARY

35:00.933 --> 35:01.933
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED AND

35:02.000 --> 35:03.833
WILL ALWAYS EXIST.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.900
PEOPLE CAN STAY MAD AT THAT OR

35:06.966 --> 35:07.900
GROW UP.

35:07.966 --> 35:11.933
I GUESS THEY MENSTRUATE?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.400
>> TRANS MEN HAVE UTERUS'.

35:13.466 --> 35:15.333
TRANS MEN MENSTRUATE.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.766
>> Bill: ALL MEN?

35:18.833 --> 35:20.933
WAIT, ALL TRANS MEN HAVE

35:21.000 --> 35:21.900
UTERUSES?

35:21.966 --> 35:23.866
>> TRANS MEN ARE BIOLOGICALLY

35:23.933 --> 35:24.766
FEMALE AND TEN TRANSITION TO

35:24.833 --> 35:26.800
MALE, NOT ALL TRANS PEOPLE GET

35:26.866 --> 35:29.166
BOTTOM SURGERY, AND NOT ALL

35:29.233 --> 35:30.700
TRANS MEN GET

35:30.766 --> 35:31.900
HYSTERECTOMIES, AND THERE ARE

35:31.966 --> 35:34.300
TRANS MEN WHO HAVE UTERUSES AND

35:34.366 --> 35:36.800
WANT TO GET PREGNANT, THEY CAN

35:36.866 --> 35:38.500
MENSTRUATE AND GET PREGNANT.

35:38.566 --> 35:40.033
IF THEY ARE ON TESTOSTERONE, IT

35:40.100 --> 35:41.700
SUPPRESSES ADMINISTRATION, AND

35:41.766 --> 35:44.900
IF THEY WANT TO GET PREGNANT,

35:44.966 --> 35:47.400
SOME CAN GET RAPED, BY SIS

35:47.466 --> 35:48.566
PEOPLE WHO ARE ANGRY AT THEM FOR

35:48.633 --> 35:53.733
BEING TRANS, COULD GET PREGNANT-

35:53.800 --> 35:55.500
>> MAYBE SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID

35:55.566 --> 35:57.200
ABORTION IS AN ISSUE WHO AFFECTS

35:57.266 --> 35:58.800
EVERYONE WHO HAS SEX.

35:58.866 --> 35:59.700
LET'S MAKE IT INCLUSIVE --

35:59.766 --> 36:01.366
>> Bill: SHE DID.

36:01.433 --> 36:03.533
"EVERY PERSON WHO ENGAGES IN

36:03.600 --> 36:03.733
SEX."

36:03.800 --> 36:04.700
BUT MY QUESTION IS POLITICAL.

36:04.766 --> 36:06.200
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WOMAN'S

36:06.266 --> 36:06.400
ISSUE.

36:06.466 --> 36:09.366
AND WHEN YOU SAY "THIS IS NOT A

36:09.433 --> 36:11.566
WOMAN'S ISSUE," I'M WONDERING IF

36:11.633 --> 36:14.200
THAT IS THE BEST -- IT'S

36:14.266 --> 36:15.566
IMPORTANT, THE 2-SPIRIT VOTE I'M

36:15.633 --> 36:17.266
SURE IS VERY IMPORTANT.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.233
I'M NOT MOCKING TWO SPIRIT, THIS

36:20.300 --> 36:22.300
IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD

36:22.366 --> 36:22.466
IT.

36:22.533 --> 36:26.300
MAYBE IF THE TONE OF THIS WASN'T

36:26.366 --> 36:27.400
LIKE, MORONS WHO DON'T KNOW THAT

36:27.466 --> 36:30.566
MEN CAN MENSTRUATE AND WHAT TWO

36:30.633 --> 36:32.066
SPIRIT IS, CATCH UP.

36:32.133 --> 36:33.200
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE HATE --

36:33.266 --> 36:34.666
>> I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

36:34.733 --> 36:36.366
IS LET'S GET DOWN TRIBALISM,

36:36.433 --> 36:37.866
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH

36:37.933 --> 36:40.066
TRIBALISM IS THESE PEOPLE GET

36:40.133 --> 36:41.166
AFFILIATED, ALMOST NO MATTER

36:41.233 --> 36:43.500
WHAT, TO AN OPINION AND A

36:43.566 --> 36:43.800
STANDPOINT.

36:43.866 --> 36:46.366
>> I HAVE TO SAY, I COMPLETELY

36:46.433 --> 36:48.866
AGREE WITH AOC THAT TRANS, TWO

36:48.933 --> 36:50.666
SPIRIT, NONBINARY PEOPLE ALWAYS

36:50.733 --> 36:51.433
EXISTED.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.066
40 YEARS AGO, GAYS AND

36:53.133 --> 36:53.366
LESBIANS --

36:53.433 --> 36:55.233
>> Bill: BUT MANY ARE JUST

36:55.300 --> 36:55.633
LEARNING ABOUT IT.

36:55.700 --> 36:56.833
>> WE SHOULDN'T BE SO SCOLDING

36:56.900 --> 36:58.966
IN TONE, BUT I DISAGREE THAT

36:59.033 --> 37:00.000
ABORTION IS NOT A WOMAN'S ISSUE

37:00.066 --> 37:01.366
AND WE SHOULD NOT DESCRIBE IT AS

37:01.433 --> 37:02.100
ONE.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.066
THE LEFT TALKS ABOUT VOTER

37:03.133 --> 37:04.933
SUPPRESSION LAWS THAT MAKE IT

37:05.000 --> 37:06.166
HARDER TO VOTE AS RACIST.

37:06.233 --> 37:08.566
THEY ARE RACIST IN THEIR INTENT

37:08.633 --> 37:09.700
THEY TARGET BLACK VOTERS

37:09.766 --> 37:11.300
PARTICULARLY, AND WE TALK ABOUT

37:11.366 --> 37:12.500
THAT AS A RACIAL ISSUE, EVEN

37:12.566 --> 37:13.500
THOUGH SOME WHITE PEOPLE AREN'T

37:13.566 --> 37:15.433
GOING TO BE ABLE TO VOTE, DON'T

37:15.500 --> 37:16.133
HAVE VOTER I.D., MIGHT HAVE A

37:16.200 --> 37:18.366
HARDER TIME VOTING, WE DON'T SAY

37:18.433 --> 37:19.200
"DON'T TALK ABOUT VOTER

37:19.266 --> 37:21.000
SUPPRESSION LIKE IT IS ABOUT

37:21.066 --> 37:22.133
RACE BECAUSE SOME WHITE PEOPLE,"

37:22.200 --> 37:24.100
AND I THINK WE CAN DO THE

37:24.166 --> 37:26.366
SAME -- WE CAN WALK THE SAME

37:26.433 --> 37:28.100
LINE ON ABORTION.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.733
YES, IT IS MISOGYNISTIC,

37:29.800 --> 37:31.166
PATRIARCHAL, IT TARGETS WOMEN,

37:31.233 --> 37:32.366
IT IS ABOUT CONTROLLING WOMEN'S

37:32.433 --> 37:33.166
BODIES.

37:33.233 --> 37:35.300
IS GOING TO IMPACT SOME TRANS,

37:35.366 --> 37:36.733
TWO SPIRIT, AND NONBINARY PEOPLE

37:36.800 --> 37:37.800
WHO MIGHT NEED ACCESS TO

37:37.866 --> 37:39.600
ABORTION, TOO, BUT THE INTENT OF

37:39.666 --> 37:42.333
THE LAW, THE INTENT OF THE

37:42.400 --> 37:43.833
LAW IS TARGETING VOTER

37:43.900 --> 37:44.733
SUPPRESSION, THAT IS RACIST,

37:44.800 --> 37:45.466
EVEN THOUGH SOME WHITE PEOPLE

37:45.533 --> 37:48.866
ARE GOING TO GET FUCKED OVERCOME

37:48.933 --> 37:49.433
TOO.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.366
ANTICHOICE, ANTIABORTION LAWS

37:50.433 --> 37:51.966
GOING ON IN TEXAS IS TO TARGET

37:52.033 --> 37:52.300
WOMEN.

37:52.366 --> 37:53.633
AND IT IS GOING TO IMPACT SOME

37:53.700 --> 37:56.100
TRANS MEN, TOO.

37:56.166 --> 38:00.333
[APPLAUSE]

38:00.400 --> 38:03.533
>> Bill: MAYBE HELP US ALONG,

38:03.600 --> 38:04.066
EXPLAIN, DON'T HAVE THIS

38:04.133 --> 38:05.333
ATTITUDE LIKE THE PART OF THE

38:05.400 --> 38:05.933
COUNTRY THAT ISN'T COMPLETELY

38:06.000 --> 38:09.166
CAUGHT UP WITH THIS IS JUST

38:09.233 --> 38:10.933
MORONIC AND I CAN'T EVEN BEAR TO

38:11.000 --> 38:13.066
DEAL WITH YOU, GROW UP.

38:13.133 --> 38:16.366
IT'S JUST -- FIRST OF ALL, IT'S

38:16.433 --> 38:17.300
JUST BAD POLITICS.

38:17.366 --> 38:18.566
>> IT IS BAD POLITICS.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.500
>> Bill: THESE AREN'T -- I

38:20.566 --> 38:22.500
DON'T KNOW IF SHE THINKS ONLY

38:22.566 --> 38:23.966
REPUBLICANS ARE IN THAT CAMP,

38:24.033 --> 38:25.733
WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT TWO SPIRIT

38:25.800 --> 38:26.366
IS.

38:26.433 --> 38:28.133
BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

38:28.200 --> 38:28.966
JUST LEARNING SOME OF THIS

38:29.033 --> 38:30.000
STUFF, AND IT IS NEW, LET'S NOT

38:30.066 --> 38:34.133
PRETEND ALL OF THIS --

38:34.200 --> 38:35.600
>> A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT NOW

38:35.666 --> 38:37.000
BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE SAID, WHICH

38:37.066 --> 38:38.533
WAS A LITTLE SCOLDING BUT NOW WE

38:38.600 --> 38:39.266
HAVING A REASONABLE CONVERSATION

38:39.333 --> 38:40.500
ABOUT IT AND MORE PEOPLE

38:40.566 --> 38:42.566
WATCHING AND LISTENING OR

38:42.633 --> 38:44.666
FINDING OUT WHAT TWO-SPIRIT IS

38:44.733 --> 38:46.100
AND WHAT IT MEANS.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.366
>> Bill: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

38:48.433 --> 38:49.700
>> NATIVE AMERICANS DESCRIBE

38:49.766 --> 38:50.633
PEOPLE WHO ARE GENDER

38:50.700 --> 38:51.633
NONCONFORMING ARE HAVING

38:51.700 --> 38:53.133
TWO-SPIRIT, A MALE AND A FEMALE

38:53.200 --> 38:54.500
SPIRIT IN ONE BODY, ONE PERSON,

38:54.566 --> 38:57.066
AND WHAT NATIVE AMERICANS USED

38:57.133 --> 38:58.300
IT TO MEAN WHAT WE USE TRANS TO

38:58.366 --> 39:00.333
MEAN, THAT IS WHY YOU SEE IT

39:00.400 --> 39:03.200
LUMPED TOGETHER WITH TRANS,

39:03.266 --> 39:04.166
TWO-SPIRIT, NONBINARY.

39:04.233 --> 39:05.200
IT'S A NATIVE AMERICAN --

39:05.266 --> 39:06.933
>> Bill: OKAY, I'M A FAIRLY

39:07.000 --> 39:07.766
WELL-INFORMED PERSON, AND I JUST

39:07.833 --> 39:08.333
LEARNED AT.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.466
>> YET, BUT YOU WERE OPEN TO

39:10.533 --> 39:11.600
LEARNING AT.

39:11.666 --> 39:12.766
>> Bill: I AM OPENING TO

39:12.833 --> 39:13.133
LEARNING IT.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.533
>> WHAT YOU LEARNED IT BECAUSE

39:15.600 --> 39:16.300
OF WHAT AOC --

39:16.366 --> 39:17.233
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO

39:17.300 --> 39:17.433
DO IT.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.166
>> I WISH THE LEFT TO TAKE THE

39:19.233 --> 39:21.766
EXAMPLE OF OBAMA IN 2007.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.266
MICHELLE AND BARACK BOTH DID,

39:23.333 --> 39:24.733
THEY NEVER GOT ANGRY AND PUBLIC.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.200
AND THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE

39:26.266 --> 39:28.300
ANGRY ALL THE TIME.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.600
>> Bill: ABSOLUTELY.

39:29.666 --> 39:31.600
>> BUT WOULD HAVE COST VOTES HE

39:31.666 --> 39:32.200
NEEDED --

39:32.266 --> 39:32.933
>> Bill: TOOK THE BAIT --

39:33.000 --> 39:34.700
>> AN EXCUSE TO VOTE AGAINST

39:34.766 --> 39:35.700
HIM, BECAUSE HE WANTED THE POWER

39:35.766 --> 39:37.566
TO BENEFIT THE LIVES OF PEOPLE

39:37.633 --> 39:38.966
HE WANTED TO CHANGE, SO HE NEVER

39:39.033 --> 39:41.366
GOT ANGRY IN PUBLIC, AND IT WAS

39:41.433 --> 39:41.933
STRATEGIC AND POLITICAL.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.366
SHOULD A BLACK MAN BE ABLE TO

39:43.433 --> 39:44.800
GET ANGRY IN PUBLIC AND GET

39:44.866 --> 39:46.200
ELECTED PRESIDENT?

39:46.266 --> 39:47.600
ABSOLUTELY.

39:47.666 --> 39:48.133
CAN ONE?

39:48.200 --> 39:48.300
NO.

39:48.366 --> 39:49.100
AND OBAMA KNEW THAT.

39:49.166 --> 39:50.533
THE LESSON HERE FOR THE LEFT,

39:50.600 --> 39:52.166
CAN WE BE A LITTLE MORE LIKE

39:52.233 --> 39:54.466
OBAMA ABOUT OUR RHETORIC AND

39:54.533 --> 39:56.500
POSITIONING, TO BRING ALONG THE

39:56.566 --> 39:57.966
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT

39:58.033 --> 39:58.833
TWO-SPIRIT MEANS YET BUT WE

39:58.900 --> 40:00.566
STILL NEED THEIR VOTE, SO DON'T

40:00.633 --> 40:01.900
FLIP THEM OFF WHILE YOU ARE

40:01.966 --> 40:03.500
TELLING THEM WHAT TWO-SPIRIT

40:03.566 --> 40:03.700
MEANS.

40:03.766 --> 40:04.600
>> AND BE LESS TRIBAL.

40:04.666 --> 40:06.400
I MEAN, IF YOU WERE TO PUT THE

40:06.466 --> 40:07.433
FOUNDING FATHERS IN A TIME

40:07.500 --> 40:08.533
CAPSULE AND BRING THEM TO THE

40:08.600 --> 40:10.800
MODERN ERA, I THINK THEY WOULD

40:10.866 --> 40:11.433
BE PRETTY SHOCKED --

40:11.500 --> 40:14.133
>> Bill: THEY WOULD BE

40:14.200 --> 40:14.766
CANCELED.

40:14.833 --> 40:15.166
[LAUGHTER]

40:15.233 --> 40:15.666
>> STRAIGHTAWAY.

40:15.733 --> 40:19.366
>> PORTION VERY GOOD REASONS,

40:19.433 --> 40:20.266
TOO, ACTUALLY.

40:20.333 --> 40:21.766
>> THEY DID NOT ENVISION AN

40:21.833 --> 40:23.566
AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE WAS AS

40:23.633 --> 40:24.066
TRIBAL AS THIS.

40:24.133 --> 40:25.266
THEY TRIED TO BUILD IN CHECKS

40:25.333 --> 40:26.766
AND BALANCES TO AVOID THIS.

40:26.833 --> 40:28.100
GOING BACK TO THAT SPIRIT OF

40:28.166 --> 40:28.866
HAVING EMPATHY AND TRY TO REACH

40:28.933 --> 40:35.666
OUT TO PEOPLE WHO, SHOCKED, MAY

40:35.733 --> 40:36.300
HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW

40:36.366 --> 40:36.600
FROM YOU --

40:36.666 --> 40:37.200
>> Bill: IT'S A BIG COUNTRY

40:37.266 --> 40:38.466
WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

40:38.533 --> 40:40.533
LIKE YOU, AND JUST TO INSIST

40:40.600 --> 40:41.600
THAT YOU COME OVER AND BE

40:41.666 --> 40:44.133
EXACTLY LIKE I SAY YOU ARE

40:44.200 --> 40:44.433
IMMEDIATELY!

40:44.500 --> 40:46.200
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

40:46.266 --> 40:48.000
>> ONE ON ONE ANTHROPOLOGY IS

40:48.066 --> 40:48.733
ACTUALLY RECOGNIZING THAT JUST

40:48.800 --> 40:50.300
BECAUSE IT IS YOUR WORLDVIEW, IT

40:50.366 --> 40:51.233
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN ASSUME IT

40:51.300 --> 40:53.933
SHOULD BE EVERYONE ELSE'S.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.933
IT IS ABOUT TRYING TO LISTEN TO

40:56.000 --> 40:57.766
SOMEBODY ELSE OR CHANGE, AND

40:57.833 --> 40:58.666
ACTUALLY RECOGNIZING -- THE ART

40:58.733 --> 41:00.300
OF TRYING TO LISTEN TO ANOTHER

41:00.366 --> 41:00.966
POINT OF VIEW DOESN'T JUST GIVE

41:01.033 --> 41:03.700
YOU EMPATHY FOR OTHERS, AND

41:03.766 --> 41:05.333
ACTUALLY TEACHES YOU ABOUT

41:05.400 --> 41:06.300
YOURSELF, TOO.

41:06.366 --> 41:07.866
THERE IS THIS GREAT CHINESE

41:07.933 --> 41:10.533
PROVERB: "A FISH CAN'T SEE WATER

41:10.600 --> 41:11.666
UNLESS YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR

41:11.733 --> 41:14.566
FISHBOWL AND GO SWIM IN A

41:14.633 --> 41:16.100
DIFFERENT BALL FOR A BIT."

41:16.166 --> 41:17.000
AFTER A COVE IN 19 LOCKED DOWN,

41:17.066 --> 41:19.500
WHERE WE HAVE ALL BEEN LOCKED

41:19.566 --> 41:20.700
DOWN WITH OUR OWN TRIBE COME OUT

41:20.766 --> 41:22.500
ON POD, PEOPLE LIKE US, THERE IS

41:22.566 --> 41:24.000
A DESPERATE NEED RIGHT NOW TO

41:24.066 --> 41:25.766
JUMP OUT AND GO SWIM IN SOME

41:25.833 --> 41:27.333
OTHER WATER AND TRY, SHOCK

41:27.400 --> 41:29.333
HORROR, TALK TO SOMEONE WHO

41:29.400 --> 41:30.433
MIGHT BE FROM A DIFFERENT PARTY.

41:30.500 --> 41:31.766
>> Bill: OH, I CANNOT AGREE

41:31.833 --> 41:31.966
MORE.

41:32.033 --> 41:34.266
[APPLAUSE]

41:34.333 --> 41:35.966
AND DON'T TALK POLITICS WITH

41:36.033 --> 41:36.166
THEM.

41:36.233 --> 41:36.866
JUST TALK.

41:36.933 --> 41:39.833
>> YES.

41:39.900 --> 41:40.166
TALK DRESSES.

41:40.233 --> 41:41.266
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU THIS

41:41.333 --> 41:41.966
ABOUT GAY AND TRANS.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.500
THEY ARE LUMPED TOGETHER.

41:44.566 --> 41:48.333
IN LGBTQ.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.166
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE

41:50.233 --> 41:51.266
ACTUAL OPPOSITES.

41:51.333 --> 41:53.133
GABE WAS ALWAYS ABOUT "WE ARE

41:53.200 --> 41:55.066
BORN THIS WAY," WHICH I THINK IS

41:55.133 --> 41:55.266
TRUE.

41:55.333 --> 41:58.766
AND TRANS IS ABOUT "WE ARE WHAT

41:58.833 --> 42:00.733
WE SAY WE ARE GOING TO BE.

42:00.800 --> 42:04.100
WE ARE NOT BORN ANYWAY, WE

42:04.166 --> 42:04.800
CHOOSE."

42:04.866 --> 42:06.200
ISN'T THAT KIND OF THE OPPOSITE?

42:06.266 --> 42:07.966
>> IN MANY WAYS, IT IS THE

42:08.033 --> 42:09.466
TRANCE AND GAIN EXPERIENCE ARE

42:09.533 --> 42:10.200
VERY DIFFERENT, IN SOME WAYS

42:10.266 --> 42:11.533
THEY ARE SIMILAR.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.833
>> Bill: BUT IS A RIFT?

42:14.900 --> 42:15.800
>> THE DEFAULT OF SOME

42:15.866 --> 42:16.866
ASSUMPTION WAS THAT I WAS

42:16.933 --> 42:18.000
STRAIGHT AND I TO COME OUT AND

42:18.066 --> 42:19.533
SAY, YOU KNOW, THE ASSUMPTION MY

42:19.600 --> 42:20.566
FAMILY AND CHURCH AND EVERYONE

42:20.633 --> 42:21.266
AROUND ME HAVE MADE ARE NOT

42:21.333 --> 42:23.766
TRUE, I AM GAY.

42:23.833 --> 42:24.866
FOR TRANS PEOPLE, WHO HAVE AN

42:24.933 --> 42:28.766
INNER SENSE OF THEMSELVES AS

42:28.833 --> 42:30.500
NOT -- THAT THEIR SEX DOES NOT

42:30.566 --> 42:31.166
ALIGN WITH THEIR GENDER

42:31.233 --> 42:31.633
IDENTITY.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.066
IT IS A LONG PROCESS TO GET TO

42:33.133 --> 42:35.166
THE POINT WHERE YOU COME OUT

42:35.233 --> 42:35.800
ABOUT BEING TRANS.

42:35.866 --> 42:37.300
THE ASSUMPTION IS BECAUSE YOU

42:37.366 --> 42:39.266
HAVE A PENIS YOU ARE A MAN AND A

42:39.333 --> 42:41.366
VAGINA, YOU ARE A WOMAN.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.866
NOT AN UNREASONABLE ASCENSION,

42:42.933 --> 42:44.333
ACCURATE 99% OF THE TIME, RIGHT?

42:44.400 --> 42:47.066
BUT TRANS PEOPLE, THE SEX DOES

42:47.133 --> 42:48.233
NOT ALIGN WITH THE GENDER

42:48.300 --> 42:48.866
IDENTITY OF WHO THEY KNOW

42:48.933 --> 42:50.133
THEMSELVES TO BE AND THE COMING

42:50.200 --> 42:51.500
OUT THING IS VERY SIMILAR

42:51.566 --> 42:53.566
BETWEEN THE GAY AND TRANS

42:53.633 --> 42:53.866
EXPERIENCE.

42:53.933 --> 42:55.000
TRANS PEOPLE ALWAYS WERE TRANS,

42:55.066 --> 42:56.533
THEY JUST HADN'T COME OUT YET.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.600
I ALWAYS WAS GAY, BUT THERE WAS

42:58.666 --> 43:00.133
A TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE PEOPLE

43:00.200 --> 43:01.166
THOUGHT IT WAS STRAIGHT.

43:01.233 --> 43:02.200
>> Bill: BUT THEY TRANSITION

43:02.266 --> 43:03.966
KIDS NOW AT A VERY YOUNG AGE, SO

43:04.033 --> 43:04.833
THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN,

43:04.900 --> 43:06.900
BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM A VERY

43:06.966 --> 43:07.766
YOUNG AGE, THEY HAVE BEEN --

43:07.833 --> 43:09.333
>> THERE ARE GENDER TO SUPPORT

43:09.400 --> 43:10.600
CHILDREN WHO ARE ALLOWED TO

43:10.666 --> 43:11.566
SOCIALLY TRANSITION.

43:11.633 --> 43:13.866
THERE SHOULD BE AND THERE ARE

43:13.933 --> 43:17.400
SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE, AND MOST

43:17.466 --> 43:18.700
KIDS ARE ALLOWED TO SOCIALLY

43:18.766 --> 43:19.900
TRANSITION, WHERE THEIR HAIR

43:19.966 --> 43:21.366
LONGER, CHANGE THEIR NAME,

43:21.433 --> 43:23.733
PRONOUNS, EXPLORE THEIR GENDER

43:23.800 --> 43:24.133
IDENTITY.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.066
THE ADVICE THAT CLINICIANS GIVE

43:25.133 --> 43:26.900
IS TO WAIT AND SEE IF IT IS

43:26.966 --> 43:28.766
CONSISTENT, PERSISTENT, AND

43:28.833 --> 43:30.300
INSISTENT AROUND GENDER, BUT A

43:30.366 --> 43:31.566
LOT OF KIDS WHO EXPERIMENT WITH

43:31.633 --> 43:34.266
GENDER AND EXPLORE WIND UP

43:34.333 --> 43:36.333
IDENTIFYING WITH THEIR BIRTH SEX

43:36.400 --> 43:36.800
EVENTUALLY.

43:36.866 --> 43:37.866
SOME KIDS DO TRANSITION AND NEED

43:37.933 --> 43:39.166
TO TRANSITION AND IT SAVES THEIR

43:39.233 --> 43:40.500
LIVES TO LET THEM TRANSITION.

43:40.566 --> 43:42.633
>> Bill: RIGHT.

43:42.700 --> 43:44.066
AND SOME REGRET IT.

43:44.133 --> 43:44.333
[APPLAUSE]

43:44.400 --> 43:45.333
THAT HAPPENS TOO.

43:45.400 --> 43:45.566
BE FAIR.

43:45.633 --> 43:46.733
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO D

43:46.800 --> 43:47.700
TRANSITION, THAT IS A THING THAT

43:47.766 --> 43:49.666
CAN HAPPEN.

43:49.733 --> 43:51.966
WE NEED TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFE

43:52.033 --> 43:52.900
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRANSITIONED

43:52.966 --> 43:54.333
ANTI-TRANSITION TO NOT GET

43:54.400 --> 43:55.433
TRIBAL ABOUT THAT, EITHER.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.700
>> Bill: COULD NOT AGREE MORE.

43:57.766 --> 43:59.066
SO WHY DO YOU THINK THERE WAS

43:59.133 --> 44:03.866
NOT A BIG BABY BOOM FROM THE

44:03.933 --> 44:04.133
PANDEMIC?

44:04.200 --> 44:06.733
USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE GET LOCKED

44:06.800 --> 44:08.566
IN, LIKE BLACK OUT, JUST ONE

44:08.633 --> 44:10.200
DAY, AND OH, NINE MONTHS AFTER

44:10.266 --> 44:11.666
THE BLACKOUT, WHICH I ALWAYS

44:11.733 --> 44:13.266
THINK IS VERY INSULTING TO YOUR

44:13.333 --> 44:15.733
PARTNER, OH, I CAN'T WATCH "THE

44:15.800 --> 44:17.300

44:17.366 --> 44:18.066
FUCK YOU.

44:18.133 --> 44:21.233
KIND OF INSULTING, BUT OKAY.

44:21.300 --> 44:23.300
WHY, BEING LOCKED IN, WE HAD AN

44:23.366 --> 44:24.300
ACTUAL SEX RECESSION.

44:24.366 --> 44:25.700
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

44:25.766 --> 44:27.966
>> WELL, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, IT

44:28.033 --> 44:29.333
WAS A FRIGHTENING TIME.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.566
IT WAS SCARY, IT WAS UNCERTAIN.

44:31.633 --> 44:33.166
>> Bill: THAT SCARY THAT YOU

44:33.233 --> 44:36.400
COULDN'T FUCK IN THEIR OWN HOME?

44:36.466 --> 44:36.666
[LAUGHTER]

44:36.733 --> 44:38.300

44:38.366 --> 44:40.000
JUSTIN LEE MILLER OUT OF THE

44:40.066 --> 44:42.533
KINSEY INSTITUTE DID A STUDY OF

44:42.600 --> 44:43.533
HOW THE PANDEMIC IS CHANGING

44:43.600 --> 44:44.533
PEOPLE'S SEX LIVES.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.500
ROUGHLY LIKE HALF OF THE PEOPLE

44:46.566 --> 44:48.333
STUDIED, IT WAS A LARGE SAMPLE

44:48.400 --> 44:51.166
SIDE, HAD A LOT MORE SEX AND A

44:51.233 --> 44:54.466
HAVE HAD A LOT LESS OR NONE.

44:54.533 --> 44:55.666
WHETHER YOU WANT TO FUCK YOUR

44:55.733 --> 44:56.633
PARTNER IS A VERY DIFFERENT

44:56.700 --> 44:57.266
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT

44:57.333 --> 44:59.700
TO MAKE A BABY.

44:59.766 --> 45:01.133
BRING A BABY INTO A WORLD WHERE

45:01.200 --> 45:02.866
DURING THE PANDEMIC IT LOOKED

45:02.933 --> 45:04.166

ANOTHER TERM, THE WORLD IS ON

45:07.166 --> 45:07.600

COLLAPSING.

45:07.966 --> 45:10.933
[APPLAUSE]

45:11.000 --> 45:14.533

45:14.600 --> 45:16.266
COVID-19 HAS SHOWN PEOPLE HOW

45:16.333 --> 45:18.333

45:23.766 --> 45:25.100

45:25.166 --> 45:25.933

45:28.466 --> 45:29.033
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE LAST ONE

51:00.900 --> 51:02.566
ESPN REPORTER RACHEL NICHOLS WAS

THAT CRAPPY LONGTIME RECORD ON

51:19.833 --> 51:22.000
DIVERSITY.

51:22.066 --> 51:22.800
THE CALL WAS LEAKED, AND SHE

51:22.866 --> 51:25.233
WAS TOAST.

51:25.300 --> 51:27.000
NOW, IN ADDITION TO THE FACT

51:27.066 --> 51:29.700
THAT A PERSON SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

51:29.766 --> 51:30.866
LOVE GETTING FIRED, EVEN IF IT

51:30.933 --> 51:32.133
DOES ACHIEVE MORE "EQUITY,"

51:32.200 --> 51:33.400
THIS WAS A PRIVATE CALL.

51:33.466 --> 51:33.966
DOES PRIVATE MEAN ANYTHING

51:34.033 --> 51:35.266
ANYMORE?

51:35.333 --> 51:38.333
APPARENTLY NOT.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.066
EVEN SADDER, THIS LOVE OF

51:40.133 --> 51:43.100
SNITCHING SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE

51:43.166 --> 51:43.833
FEW AREAS THAT IS NOW TRULY

51:43.900 --> 51:45.033
BIPARTISAN -- SNITCH NATION

51:45.100 --> 51:46.933
ISN'T ABOUT WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON,

51:47.000 --> 51:48.066
IT'S ABOUT THIS MINDSET WHERE

51:48.133 --> 51:49.300
EVERYONE IS AN AMATEUR SECRET

51:49.366 --> 51:50.166
POLICEMAN AND TATTLING IS A

51:50.233 --> 51:52.633
VIRTUE.

51:52.700 --> 51:53.733
THE WOKE SIDE OF THE INTERNET

51:53.800 --> 51:55.133
THINKS GOING THROUGH SOMEONE'S

51:55.200 --> 51:57.400
OLD MYSPACE ACCOUNT MAKES THEM

51:57.466 --> 51:58.666
PART OF THE RESISTANCE -- IT

51:58.733 --> 52:03.000

52:03.066 --> 52:06.533
[APPLAUSE]

52:06.600 --> 52:09.166
AND REPUBLICANS LATELY, BESIDES

52:09.233 --> 52:10.800
SPONSORING THAT NEW REALITY SHOW

52:10.866 --> 52:15.000
"TEXAS ZYGOTE HUNTERS," HAVE

52:15.066 --> 52:17.300
BEEN ENCOURAGING COLLEGE

52:17.366 --> 52:18.233
STUDENTS TO WHIP OUT THEIR

52:18.300 --> 52:20.033
PHONES TO RECORD AND REPORT

52:20.100 --> 52:20.633
PROFESSORS WHO ESPOUSE LEFTIST

52:20.700 --> 52:24.300
IDEAS.

52:24.366 --> 52:25.333
[LAUGHS]

52:25.400 --> 52:26.566
AS ALWAYS, THE SNOWFLAKES FALL

52:26.633 --> 52:27.133
JUST AS HARD ON THE RIGHT AS

52:27.200 --> 52:31.000
THEY DO ON THE LEFT.

52:31.066 --> 52:34.800
[APPLAUSE]

52:34.866 --> 52:38.200
COLLEGES PRIDE THEMSELVES ON

52:38.266 --> 52:40.033
BEING "SAFE SPACES" -- NOT FOR

52:40.100 --> 52:41.800
PROFESSORS, AT LEAST NOT ANY WHO

52:41.866 --> 52:42.800
MIGHT WANT TO STRETCH YOUNG

52:42.866 --> 52:43.466
MINDS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND

52:43.533 --> 52:46.366
TRY ON NEW IDEAS.

52:46.433 --> 52:48.233
YEAH, TRY THAT AT YOUR PERIL.

52:48.300 --> 52:51.166
SAME WITH COMEDY CLUBS, WHERE

52:51.233 --> 52:52.800
EVER SINCE THE iPHONE, COMICS

52:52.866 --> 52:53.566
HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT

52:53.633 --> 52:54.966
SNITCHES IN THE AUDIENCE WHO'LL

52:55.033 --> 52:59.566
RAT THEM OUT FOR "CROSSING THE

52:59.633 --> 53:00.333
LINE" -- WHICH IS PRACTICALLY

53:00.400 --> 53:00.866
THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF A

53:00.933 --> 53:04.600
COMEDIAN.

53:04.666 --> 53:09.133
[APPLAUSE]

53:09.200 --> 53:11.433
COMICS ARE JOKING CONSTANTLY --

53:11.500 --> 53:13.433
EVEN SOME PEOPLE WHO AREN'T

53:13.500 --> 53:14.933
COMICS DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE

53:15.000 --> 53:17.133
LUCKY ENOUGH IN LIFE TO BE

53:17.200 --> 53:18.566
AROUND PEOPLE LIKE THAT, I'M

53:18.633 --> 53:19.266
SURE YOU KNOW: THEY CAN'T ALL BE

53:19.333 --> 53:23.700
GEMS.

53:23.766 --> 53:24.000
[LAUGHTER]

53:24.066 --> 53:29.033
[APPLAUSE]

53:29.100 --> 53:30.866
SOMETIMES YOU GET "THE TWISTIES"

53:30.933 --> 53:31.633
AND THE JOKE DOESN'T LAND JUST

53:31.700 --> 53:33.700
RIGHT.

53:33.766 --> 53:34.333
EXPOSING THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU

53:34.400 --> 53:37.366
NOBLE.

53:37.433 --> 53:38.766
YOU'RE NOT DAVID KACZYNSKI, THE

53:38.833 --> 53:41.200
BROTHER OF THE UNABOMBER, WHO

53:41.266 --> 53:41.833
TURNED IN HIS OWN BROTHER, LEST

53:41.900 --> 53:43.900
ANY MORE MAIL BOMBS GO OFF.

53:43.966 --> 53:45.433
THAT WAS NOBLE.

53:45.500 --> 53:49.000
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT

53:49.066 --> 53:50.866
BOMBS, AND NOT BOMBING.

53:50.933 --> 53:52.066
THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE

53:52.133 --> 53:52.666
BETWEEN THE UNABOMBER AND THE

53:52.733 --> 53:54.800
EDITOR OF "TEEN VOGUE."

53:54.866 --> 53:55.733
FOR ONE THING, THE UNABOMBER

53:55.800 --> 54:00.633
MADE SOME GOOD POINTS.

54:00.700 --> 54:00.900
[LAUGHTER]

54:00.966 --> 54:04.333
[APPLAUSE]

54:04.400 --> 54:06.000
OR THINK OF EDWARD SNOWDEN,

54:06.066 --> 54:07.533
ENDURING EXILE IN RUSSIA SO HE

54:07.600 --> 54:08.666
COULD EXPOSE UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENT

54:08.733 --> 54:11.700
SNOOPING: NOBLE.

54:11.766 --> 54:16.500
COLONEL ALEXANDER VINDMAN,

54:16.566 --> 54:17.066
EXPOSING THE UKRAINE FIASCO:

54:17.133 --> 54:18.900
NOBLE.

54:18.966 --> 54:21.200
[APPLAUSE]

54:21.266 --> 54:22.100
THAT'S NOT YOU TAKING DOWN THE

54:22.166 --> 54:24.800

54:29.033 --> 54:30.466
YOU'RE NOT A JOURNALIST.

54:30.533 --> 54:32.633
YOU'RE JUST A CREEPY LITTLE RAT.

54:32.700 --> 54:33.266

54:46.166 --> 54:47.466

54:47.533 --> 54:48.066
GREAT, NOW WE CAN TEAR DOWN THE

54:48.133 --> 54:50.433
