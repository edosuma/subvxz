21:49.000 --> 21:54.066
To spend your whole life
being gazed at.

21:54.066 --> 21:56.566
As a child, I was seen
as a curiosity.

21:56.566 --> 21:57.666
Never allowed to forget

21:57.666 --> 22:00.600
I was neither one thing
nor the other.

22:00.600 --> 22:05.966
Then I came to England,
my father's country,

22:05.966 --> 22:08.300
only to see my difference
reflected in the eyes

22:08.300 --> 22:11.333
of every person
I have since met.

22:11.333 --> 22:17.100
So, it's simply the stare
I am used to, rendered palpable.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.000
Oh, my dear Miss Lambe.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.033
I cannot speak to
your experience.

22:23.033 --> 22:28.500
I have spent my entire life
being... overlooked.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.400
Even by those closest to me.

22:31.400 --> 22:37.533
But yet, when I saw his
drawing of me, I...

22:37.533 --> 22:41.266
I felt, well...

22:41.266 --> 22:45.366
I felt seen for who I am, or...

22:45.366 --> 22:47.733
Perhaps for who I'd like to be.

22:47.733 --> 22:52.366
He asked me how I would
like to be seen.

22:52.366 --> 22:54.900
I didn't know how to answer.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.233

22:57.233 --> 23:02.000
through a particular set
of views and...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.800
...prejudices.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.566
But not Mr. Lockhart.

23:06.566 --> 23:10.366

with a rare clarity.

23:10.366 --> 23:15.233
Perhaps this is what it means
to be an artist.

23:15.233 --> 23:19.066
Mary thinks he is not
to be trusted.

23:19.066 --> 23:21.300

23:21.300 --> 23:24.766

24:06.566 --> 24:08.233

24:13.366 --> 24:16.033

to be struck by lightning.

Governesses, as we know,
are not easy to come by.

24:54.233 --> 24:55.400
Mr. Colbourne?

25:00.633 --> 25:02.366
Might I make an observation?

25:02.366 --> 25:03.733
You've already made
the observation.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.433
You might as well share it.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.766
It strikes me as curious
that a man might take such care

25:08.766 --> 25:12.433
