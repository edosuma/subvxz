00:42.000 --> 00:44.760
There is not one universe, There are many.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.600
A Multiverse.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.240
We have the technology
to travel between universes,,.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
,,,but travel is highly restricted
and policed,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.560
There is not one you, There are many.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.400
Each of us exists in present time,
in parallel universes,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.440
There was balance in the system,,.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.560
,,,but now a force exists
who seeks to destroy the balance,,.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.200
,,,so he can become The One.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.400
President Gore addressed Congress today
where he outlined the White House plan,,,,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Here they come, man.
They're going to take you on out.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.400
You're dead, Lawless! You're dead!
Ain't payback a bitch?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.360
Die, Lawless, you piece of shit!

02:35.000 --> 02:37.440
Die like all my boys you took out!

03:01.000 --> 03:03.800
I know they're going to kill you upstate...

03:04.000 --> 03:07.720
...but no one's getting you on my watch,
so don't sweat, Lawless.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.880
You want that thumb?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.160
Let's move him out of here.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.480
I want to hear you scream, Lawless.
Come on, scream for me.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.120
Going to get you, asshole!

03:38.000 --> 03:39.880
Yeah, walk the walk!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.560
You piece of shit! You're a dead man!

04:17.000 --> 04:18.800
Something's wrong.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.640
Prisoner down!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.440
Up there!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.160
Hold your fire! Cease fire!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.960
Woo, Scott, follow me!

05:05.000 --> 05:08.600
Razor wire should have kept anyone out,
let alone moving fast.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.760
There's no blood.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.080
Holy shit! He's doing 50!

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Adam 13 in pursuit of suspect
headed west, Third and Olympic.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Request assistance
from 2 David air unit, Over.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.080
Roger that,
Air 14 en route to Third and Olympic.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
He's going to the hole.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
We have to get there,
override him before he jumps.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.760
Give me the go-ahead. He'll never make it.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Check fire. Stick to procedure, Funsch.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.880
You were recruited to apprehend him,
not be his assassin, understand?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I can't hear you. Do you understand?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.680
Loud and clear.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.520
Yulaw! MVA!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.880
Loud and clear, huh?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.280
Roedecker! Less than a minute!

09:50.000 --> 09:51.280
Shit!

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Hands high!

09:56.000 --> 09:58.120
Thirty seconds, Roedecker.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.080
Who the hell is this now?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.880
You must be the new guy.
Where is Roedecker?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
This is your last warning.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.520
Get your hands where I can see them.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.360
Freeze!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.960
You, drop that weapon!

10:23.000 --> 10:24.720
I will kill you.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.640
No, you won't.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.840
Where is Roedecker?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.120
-Here I am.
-What the....

11:46.000 --> 11:47.360
Funsch.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.080
You stick to procedure...

11:51.000 --> 11:52.880
...it all works out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.880
Victim 117, Yu Fook Law,
Monoceros Universe,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.600
Victim 118, Swen Law, Tucana Universe.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.640
Victim 119, Ni Dilaw, Canopus Universe.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.680
Victim 120, Kia Jilaw, Serpenz Universe.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.640
Victim 121, Seth Law, Procyon Universe.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.640
Victim 122, Frun Law, Shauwla Universe.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.560
Victim 123, Lawless, Anubis Universe.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.920
What's the next move?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.560
lt won't work for you anymore, Yulaw.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.840
The shortest distance
between two points...

13:19.000 --> 13:21.440
...will always be a straight line.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.760
Your line has run out. You don't see that?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.200
There's never been anything
like what I have become.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
You know that.
You were there for my first one.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.720
-I wish I'd never let there be a second.
-But there was a second.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.560
And a third.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.560
And a 123rd.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Why did you come, Harry?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.560
You miss me?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.960
I missed who you were.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.600
You've been chasing me how many years?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.480
Two years.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.480
I just need to do it one more time.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.800
There won't be a "one more time" for you.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.160
Destination,,
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.640
Gabriel Yulaw.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.280
The peoples of the Multiverse
have found you guilty...

15:42.000 --> 15:44.760
...of 123 counts of first-degree murder...

15:45.000 --> 15:48.720
...and 123 counts of unauthorized travel
to parallel universes...

15:50.000 --> 15:52.640
...by use of illegal quantum tunneling.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
For these crimes,
you have been sentenced to life...

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
...without the possibility of return...

15:59.000 --> 16:02.280
...on the Stygian Penal Colony,
in the Hades Universe.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.880
May God be with you.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.320
You may make a final statement.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.680
The Multiverse.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.560
Every universe in it is irrational...

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
...sloppy.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.480
I just try to make it rational.
I just try to make it neat.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.840
You call it murder.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.520
How could I murder myseIf 123 times?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.520
I just took those wasted energies...

16:44.000 --> 16:46.640
...and put them into one container: me.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.560
lt made me faster, smarter, stronger.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.080
What if that is our fate?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.320
To unite with our other selves.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.960
To be unified forever.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.480
To be one.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.800
I will be The One.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.720
Gabriel Yulaw...

17:22.000 --> 17:23.760
...are you ready?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.400
Are you?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.080
Wormhole opens in five,,.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.080
,,,four, three, two, one.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Wormhole's shut.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.200
lt only had a 30-second window.
Now we have to wait.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.680
Son of a bitch!

18:39.000 --> 18:41.480
-Permission to speak, sir?
-Speak.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.280
ls this part of the procedure?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
We'll get him on the other side.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.720
There's only one place he could be going.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.880
Aldrich, take these.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.560
President Bush addressed a joint session
of Congress today,,,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.840
,,,where he outlined the White House plan
for universal health care,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.240
Ronnie, you're dead! You rat!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.280
Die, you piece of shit snitch!

20:09.000 --> 20:12.600
You're going to be okay, Ronnie.
You're doing the right thing.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.960
-Go, go!
-Dead! Dead!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.760
You snitch! Dead!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.800
Something's wrong.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.560
Go, go, go! Get him out! Get him out!

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Get him in the vehicle.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.080
Get out, now. Go, go, go.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.440
Oh, shit!

21:29.000 --> 21:30.520
Cease fire!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.680
ls he soup yet?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.920
-No way he got out of there.
-He's got to be.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.200
No!

22:08.000 --> 22:09.840
Get him down! Pull!

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
One Henry Robert! Code 3!

22:15.000 --> 22:17.920
Demand immediate backup
in the delivery area!

22:24.000 --> 22:25.200
Go!

22:40.000 --> 22:42.040
I need a hand over here!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.720
Hey, on the bus!

23:13.000 --> 23:14.640
He's going OJ!

23:15.000 --> 23:17.200
-Get him!
-Let's go, Yates!

23:48.000 --> 23:49.280
Gabe!

23:58.000 --> 23:59.280
Gabe!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.600
You see that?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.440
The good news is you're not crazy.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.720
The bad news....

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I lived here my whole life.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.720
And everywhere I look for great memories.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.600
Now all I see is Larry and those kids.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Gabe.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.520
Oh, my God!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.440
I'm okay.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
-I'm okay.
-Aldrich said you were in the hospital.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
-Yeah, I was.
-Did they check you out?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.680
I checked myself. Nothing to check. See?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.840
I just need to get myseIf clear. Hey, Ollie.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.640
You were shot. You need to be examined.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
You can do it.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.240
Newsflash. I'm a vet.
You don't have paws and a tail.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
With all that's been happening to you,
you need to see someone.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.720
I'm seeing the only person I need to see.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.560
I'm serious.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.320
We'll go to the hospital,
check on Woo, after I'm done.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
You'll be all right, man.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.800
-You guys take care of him now.
-Yes, sir.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.680
Gabe? Hey, T.K.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
How is he?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.400
External injuries mostly.
EMT said he's seen a lot worse.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.640
You gave us a bigger scare
just leaving the hospital like that.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Your man went deep tonight, T.K.
Don't know how he made it up that wall.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.720
I wouldn't be here if you guys
didn't make it up right behind me.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
We never made it up that wall.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
I didn't make it out
of the goddamn parking lot.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.760
Backup unit reported you down.
We continued pursuit, unsuccessful.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.640
Only you got a good look at the suspect.
We need a description.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.680
Think it's someone out of Ronnie's posse?
Payback for snitching?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
lt was dark.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
You have anything? Anything to go on?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.320
Sorry.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.080
If you remember anything,
we'll be down the hall.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.680
Hey, man, I'm glad you're still with us.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.360
Thanks.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Why did you lie to them?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.560
lt was dark.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.400
Gabe, it's not the guys. It's me.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.480
lt was me.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.280
What?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.200
He wasn't trying to hit Ronnie.
He was aiming at me!

28:10.000 --> 28:12.240
Before I saw him, I felt him.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.480
I felt me!

28:17.000 --> 28:18.480
lt was me.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.320
Maybe the adrenaline
caused some kind of hallucination.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.680
You were shot. Your memory
could've been affected by the trauma.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.160
Or maybe it's part
of what's been happening to you.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.760
People get older. They don't get stronger.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.600
They don't get faster all of a sudden.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.600
Whatever it is, we're here now, right?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.720
And if they find something wrong with me?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.200
I don't want to lose my job.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.080
I don't want to lose you.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.840
Mrs. Law,
before we go into the MRl room...

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
...I have some questions to ask you
about your husband.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.680
-Does he have a cardiac pacemaker?
-No.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
-lntracranial aneurysm clip?
-No.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.680
Dentures, hearing aid or penile implant?

29:20.000 --> 29:23.520
No, no, and not unless he had one put in
since this morning.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.680
Mr. Law. Right this way.
I have a few forms for you to fill out.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.960
This is a painless procedure
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Dressing room's here.
Remove all your clothing.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You'll find a gown on a hook.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.960
The paperwork's already started
so we'll get you in and out in no time.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.880
Please remove
all personal metallic objects.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
That means no keys, no watches,
no credit cards...

30:19.000 --> 30:21.680
...no body piercings, no cell phones....

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
My gun.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.720
-No guns, no jewelry, no zippers.
-What?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.880
The hospital has it.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.400
You're going in for an MRl. Gabe?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.920
Remember what I said?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.720
I feel it again.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
When you're done,
we'll go get your things, all right?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
They're not giving her your gun.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.960
The guys are downstairs.
They can get the gun.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.320
Even if you did, you're not bringing it here.
That's a powerful, precise magnet.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
All right.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.720
If you start the MRl, I'll find the guys.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.960
Lose the wedding ring.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.680
Here. I got it.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.720
For Christ's sake, you're getting an MRl,
not a heart transplant.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.560
Mr. Law, I need you to remain still
for three to ten minutes.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.400
You can talk, but if you move,
we have to start all over.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Hey. Where did you guys go?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I took him in for a....

32:33.000 --> 32:35.760
Something wrong?
Can I get you something?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.400
No, I have to talk to the doctor.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Mike, I can't take my break
till I'm done with this guy.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.120
Can you wait haIf an hour?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Mr. Law, what are you doing?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Now we have to start over.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.840
Why? What did I do?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.480
Back away!

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Thought you were gonna kill me.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.400
Just give me the chance, asshole.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Get on your knees slowly.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.480
You there?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.040
On the floor, right now!

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
The floor?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.840
This is a hospital.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.200
The floor is full of germs.
You want me to get sick?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.600
It's gunfire.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.840
Let's get security.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.280
Gabe.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.440
Get back!

34:19.000 --> 34:20.800
What have you got?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Nothing.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.560
Not a thing.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.360
No! No!

34:41.000 --> 34:42.440
Be still.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Unit 15, weapon fire, south tower!

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Fourth floor, Imaging Radiology!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.640
Gabe is there.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
-Hands high! Hands high, Yulaw!
-Don't move! Don't move!

35:06.000 --> 35:07.520
Don't move!

35:13.000 --> 35:16.480
We all know if you kill me,
you have to kill the other guy.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.760
-Just let me take out one leg.
-Cuff him.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.680
I'll cover you.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.200
Go.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.680
Back, get back!

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
-It's Gabe.
-Go! Channel 7.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.240
Swing the camera. Follow him.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.520
He cut right at the end of the hall.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.960
Don't move! Stay here!

35:58.000 --> 35:59.880
Go back to the room.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.200
T.K., you can't go up there!

36:37.000 --> 36:38.720
Which one is he?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.680
-I'm okay. I'm all right.
-Don't move, Gabe! We're here to help.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.840
-I'm all right.
-Do you know where you are?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.920
-What's wrong with you?
-Where are you, Gabe?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
There are three armed men.
They killed a security officer.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
-Who are we?
-They went down the hall.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
-What's my name?
-I was unarmed. I couldn't go after them.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.240
What did you do with the gun?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.720
I don't have one. I asked T.K. to get it.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Yulaw wouldn't have known that.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
This one's safer in their custody.
Let them take him.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
You need help before you hurt yourself.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.680
Or anyone else.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.600
Anyone else? Someone tried to kill me!

37:20.000 --> 37:22.600
Please! I don't want to hurt you guys.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Let go of me!

37:28.000 --> 37:30.080
I don't want to hurt you.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.280
I don't want to hurt you guys.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.760
Settle back down!

38:03.000 --> 38:05.320
He's close to Yulaw's strength.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.600
Let go! Gabe!

38:10.000 --> 38:12.280
It's what I told you. It's me.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.440
Get home.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We have a problem here.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.880
Yeah, the real problem is
procedure sucks...

38:26.000 --> 38:27.360
...sir.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.080
All right, new procedure.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.400
Gabe is yours. I will take Yulaw.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
How you going to do that?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.120
I'll do whatever it takes.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.960
Sync up your repeater.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.840
Hey, wait a minute.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.360
I've lived through one of those.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.600
Let me do it.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.160
Sync your repeater, Funsch.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.480
All right.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.880
When the green light turns red
and stays steady and Yulaw is dead....

39:09.000 --> 39:10.400
And you.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.880
You know what to do.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.640
Not a problem.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.400
Us splitting up, you going solo,
is way out of procedure.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.920
So listen to me. I know where you're from,
what you've been through...

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
...but this place is different.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.200
Not everyone is a combatant.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.560
There are innocent people here, also.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.200
So if you get into the shit,
you trust your heart...

39:46.000 --> 39:47.760
...not your head.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.880
Loud and clear, sir.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.880
How did that son of a bitch
get out of here?

40:01.000 --> 40:04.840
Have you seen that new video,
Mr, Fanny's Been A-Pluggin'? It's hot!

40:05.000 --> 40:06.880
Dude, I like Janine.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.240
But she don't do guys.
That girl-girl stuff gets old.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.800
Why don't you rent one of those big-ass,
she-male tapes, you freak?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.400
Shut up!

40:24.000 --> 40:27.720
I can't determine occipital lobe swelling
without a complete MRl.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
-He was acting schizophrenic.
-Schizophrenia doesn't just kick in.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.640
The triggering stressor of being shot
caused a psychotic break.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
The Fifth Division is looking for him.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.680
They understand he's not himself.
They know how to bring him in.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.520
-Need a doctor?
-No, I'm all right.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.920
I am not going to let
anything happen to him.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
If it wasn't for Gabe,
I wouldn't be in this uniform.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Thanks, Bobby.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.800
-Maybe it's best if I go home.
-Good idea.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Nothing you can do here,
and he's likely to contact you there.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
If I hear from him, I'll let you know.
If you hear anything, I'll be home.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I know. I'm going to take you.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.240
We'll make sure of it. There are four units
on the way to your house. Come on.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.200
-Circle around. I'll meet you out front.
-All right.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Just when I find something
I like in this universe.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.120
Turn off the radio slowly.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.560
Who are you?

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
You're close to his strength.
The last two years, you've gotten stronger.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
Haven't jacked any more iron.
Haven't changed your diet.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.920
But you are stronger.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.160
Your mind, too.
Answers come fast without thinking.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.480
Who are you? What did you do to me?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.800
Not me. You.
You've done this to yourself.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.320
Just like old times, eh, buddy?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.640
Not exactly...

43:58.000 --> 43:59.440
...buddy.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.680
Put your hands back on the wheel, Yulaw.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Space is shaped like this.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.600
You believe this is the only universe.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.200
There's not just one universe,
there's a Multiverse.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Every time a massive star dies
and becomes a black hole...

44:19.000 --> 44:21.240
...a new universe is created.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.800
They've learned to forecast
where and when a black hole will occur.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.960
A momentary bridge
between parallel universes.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Travel is restricted.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.040
They created an agency
to police the Multiverse.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I'm a Multiverse agent.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.600
You're a nut.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
You're the one who's been seeing yourself.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.440
In this universe, you're you.
In another, you don't exist.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
In another,
you're married to the same woman.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.920
In another, to a different woman.
In another, you're married to a man.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.520
There's an energy, strain, wave,
connecting all those lives.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
We alI have one.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.040
The one between you and him
has gotten stronger.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.560
You've been feeling him, haven't you?

45:07.000 --> 45:10.440
Harry, nobody's proved
that what I'm doing is a bad thing.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.520
You've killed 123 people.
I'd say that was a very bad thing.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
You don't know what'd happen
if you killed this one.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
lt could destroy the system,
but that doesn't matter.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.200
I know. Everything must be balanced.
The party line.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.320
What do you think would happen?

45:30.000 --> 45:33.720
Some people think you'd explode,
some people think you'd implode.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.840
You're missing one.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Some people think you'd become a god.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.680
That's the one.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.560
The man you've been seeing,
the "you," he was an MVA agent.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.040
Once he was forced to defend himself
against himseIf in another universe.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.520
Killed him.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.680
In doing so, part of the other life's energy
transferred to him.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.880
Made him stronger.
Made all of you stronger.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.920
Each time he kills one of you,
the energy divides among the survivors.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.600
So, I'm next?

47:12.000 --> 47:13.720
You're the last.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.840
You and him are it.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.280
I don't want any part of this.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.040
You don't have a choice.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.760
First choice, give up. Second choice, die.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.600
Third choice.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.520
So, if everything you say is true...

48:33.000 --> 48:34.960
...what happens to me?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.240
Nobody's got all the answers.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.320
I don't believe you. Stay away.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.640
I'm alone now.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.920
I'm here to help you.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.920
Sir, I have to ask you to hold it right there.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I said freeze, asshole!

50:12.000 --> 50:14.200
Don't you people ever learn?

51:41.000 --> 51:42.320
Clear.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.160
Let them have a look first.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.160
I have to do my girl stuff.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.360
Thanks.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
TV is on.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.840
Yeah, I left it on.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.800
When I got the call about Gabe, I just ran.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.560
Grabbed my jacket, rushed downstairs.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.760
I'll turn it off.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.320
Bobby?

53:31.000 --> 53:35.080
I appreciate you being here with me
and I don't want to sound rude, but...

53:36.000 --> 53:38.320
...can I have a little privacy?

53:39.000 --> 53:40.520
Sorry, T.K.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.960
I'll be right outside.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.360
Thanks.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.400
I told you it's not wasted space.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.640
You all right?

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
-I'm afraid.
-Me, too.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.040
ls it safe to come down?

54:50.000 --> 54:52.360
No, there are sheriffs all over.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.640
I need my gun.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I left it at the hospital.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.720
I need a weapon.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.520
Yeah, okay.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.600
What's wrong?

55:43.000 --> 55:44.400
Nothing.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.160
They can see inside.
I'm just gonna pull the shade.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
Jesus. Did you ever think
when we met that day at the bookstore...

56:15.000 --> 56:17.360
...we'd be in this kind of mess?

56:23.000 --> 56:25.800
Even if I knew, I still would have come in.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.960
lt wasn't a bookstore.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
Just so you know,
I'm going to take that gun...

56:33.000 --> 56:36.040
...and kill you
before you can pull the trigger.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.040
There's nothing you can do
except give it to me.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.640
Gabe, drop it!

57:09.000 --> 57:10.560
Drop it now!

57:13.000 --> 57:14.400
Drop it!

57:50.000 --> 57:51.360
Get in!

58:09.000 --> 58:10.800
Hey, knock it off!

58:12.000 --> 58:14.520
-You're acting like him.
-I am him!

58:15.000 --> 58:16.560
Without her.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.640
My grandfather taught me
the energy of life goes in a circle...

58:54.000 --> 58:56.320
...in a perfect flow, balanced.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.440
He said, until I find my center...

59:00.000 --> 59:02.440
...my circle would never be whole.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.760
That day, I first saw her in the clinic...

59:08.000 --> 59:10.960
...I came in with a dog
that was hit by a car.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.520
I knew right away she was my center.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.800
She made me whole.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.800
How do I kill him?

59:35.000 --> 59:38.960
In an hour, there's a forecasted
wormhole opening. Three-minute window.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.320
He's attuned to your life wave.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.440
He'll try to find you, kill you,
and get back to the hole.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
That's where we get him.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.800
Get him? Kill him!

59:54.000 --> 59:55.440
Kill him?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.680
You're serious?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
My own design.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Highly modified M-590,
hand-portable system.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.400
Fires 25 smart rounds per second.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Multiple tracking modes,
plus the latest countermeasures.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.840
Each round carries an explosive warhead
with selectable fuse delays.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.280
Tracks, enters, pauses .1 microseconds,
then "Boom!"

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.520
Mixto rojo.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.320
And this is his little brother.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.800
Hasn't worked yet.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.560
Don't blame the tools.
I never had the go-ahead to terminate.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.880
Let me show you how.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.800
That'll work, too.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.200
We kill him, then it's over.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.600
Hey, you two!

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.080
Come on! Check that shit!

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.440
Let's go.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
What are you doing?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.840
What are you doing?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.080
Permission to speak, sir.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I know what I have to do.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.520
I'll never get the chance to thank you
for squaring me away.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.840
So, thank you, sir.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.920
I'm calling the cops.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Just making sure you know, if we kill him-

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.800
You have to kill me. Kill me! I don't care.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.480
As long as he's dead, I don't care.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.760
If we kill him...

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.880
...there's a chance, some say,
this whole universe could go with him.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.880
The Chinese guy
was tearing the place apart.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.120
Wormhole ETA: ten minutes.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.640
That vicinity.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.480
He's here.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.760
Shit. Take cover!

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.440
It's a bomb! Don't breathe for 20 seconds
after the blast!

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.320
Yulaw!

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.920
You came here for me.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.920
Now I'm here for you.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.480
After this, there will be only one.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.720
I won't be The One, but neither will you.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.880
Shit! Three minutes.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.680
Thirty seconds!

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.280
Shit.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Gabe, get out! Get out!

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.400
Get out!

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.520
That's him.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.160
Scanning, RHV 579. Confirm.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.120
Send him where he belongs.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.160
Destination,,
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.240
Wormhole opens in one minute.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.440
No, stop!

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.080
That's him, that's Yulaw.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.240
Wormhole opens in 30 seconds.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.560
Get him out!

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.240
Wormhole opens in 20 seconds.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.280
Wormhole opens in ten, nine,,.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.800

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.720
Wormhole opened.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.400
That man doesn't leave this room.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Sir, he assisted in Yulaw's capture.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
He's from an uninitiated universe
with no travel passport.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.600
He goes back.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
He can't go back.
They'll lock him up for life.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
He will be cared for, watched over.
Like the other.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.560
Balance will be preserved.
The wormhole closes in 40 seconds!

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
-Sir, permission to speak-
-Permission denied.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That order is bullshit!

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.800
lt doesn't matter.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.440
Take him!

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.120
I know where he has to go.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.520
I have to send you where you belong.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.680
It's procedure.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.920
Coordinates accepted.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000

Excuse me, I have a....
