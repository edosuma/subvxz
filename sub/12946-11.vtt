WEBVTT

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
GRANDDAD:

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
RUMMY:
Man, I don't get that.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
ED:
Get what?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
That textin' shit.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And what's wrong
with textin'?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Mmm.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
You mean,
aside from the fact

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
that it's the stupidest
fuckin' thing in the world?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I mean, why would anyone
in their right minds

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
spend 15 minutes tryin'
to type some shit

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Riley, get the door.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
they could have called
and said in five seconds?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Granddad, is this the broccoli
I bought at the store today?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Plus, it involves typin'
with your thumbs,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Yep, I cooked it
up for you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
which I just don't
approve of.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, you cooked it
with the ham!

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Shit. I don't know
about you,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It's pork-flavored broccoli.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
but I don't have time
to read

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Granddad, there's more pork
in the pork-flavored broccoli

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
nothin' that a motherfucker
typed with his thumbs.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Fun fact: nothin' typed
by someone's thumbs

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
than there is broccoli.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We talked about this.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
has ever been important.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Vegetables cooked with pork...
counts as pork.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
It's all just nigga
technology, anyway.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
TOM:
Hey.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What you call it?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Do I smell
pork-flavored broccoli?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
"Nigga technology."
Technology for niggas.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey, everyone. Mwah.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Only don't start trippin'
and shit, callin' me a racist.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I brought peach cobbler.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
'Cause I don't mean nigga
in a disrespectful way.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Ewwww.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I-I mean it as a general term
for ignorant motherfucker.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Miss Dubois,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
your peach cobbler
look like throw up.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Anybody of any race could be
an ignorant motherfucker.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
It do! Look!

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It look like throw up
with peas in it.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Shit, I be textin'
my ass off.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Miss Dubois,
you been eatin' peas?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Shit. Bitches like textin'.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I be textin' them all the time.
Matter of fact,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Boy, what is
wrong with you?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with her?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I also be textin'
my weed man too,

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
She the one who brought vomit

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
'cause, you know, he don't like
to be on the phone.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
over here in
a Tupperware container.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
So I text him.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That is not vomit!

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It just look like vomit.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Case in point.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Now apologize
to Miss Dubois.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So basically,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Um, i-it-- It's okay.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Really.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
nigga technology
is anything

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Fine.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Miss Dubois, I'm sorry

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
that doesn't plug
into a printer.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Does that plug
into a printer?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
your peach cobbler
look like vomit with peas.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
No.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Damn it, boy!

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Know why?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Guys, please.
We don't have to--

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
'Cause niggas never
have anything to print.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't care
if you beat me, Granddad.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I won't eat it!

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
That is disgustin'!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It's completely
uncalled for!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
GRANDDAD: You'll eat it

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Excuse me, sirs,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
if I have to shove it
down your throat!

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
would you like to buy
some candy

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Really, I didn't mean
for it to be--

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
to keep urban youth
off of drugs and gangs?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I-I know what
you tryin' to do!

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
You tryin' to kill me!

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Uh, how much?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I hate you!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Three.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You are gonna eat
that cobbler!

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
You hear that?
I said, three.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
And you're gonna act
like you like it!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
RILEY:
I don't wanna eat

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
the cobbler!

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
All right, all right, all right,
we got it. Now, beat it.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
A'ight. Three guards
ain't too bad.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Best meal I've had
in years, Robert.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Don't forget your earplugs
this time, Ed.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
What's this called?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Let's go.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I call it Granddad's
pork swine delight.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Hold up, my nigga.
Hold up.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Go time, nigga!
Let's go!

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
It consists of two pig knuckles
glazed in honey.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I sent that bitch
a smiley face.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Pig tongue marinated
in butter for two days.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Bitches love smiley faces.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay, let's
roll.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Chitlins--

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
That's pig intestines

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
for y'all that don't know.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
--soaked in hot sauce,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Nobody move
a goddamn muscle!

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
drizzled with mayonnaise,

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
and then set to harden

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Best start actin' like you're
a mannequin or something.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
on my back porch

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Like you wanna stand
in the window--

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
in 3 pounds of cheddar cheese.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Agh!

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Mommy?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm sleepy.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Everybody get on
the ground, now! Now!

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, don't worry about that,
little baby.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That's just "the itis."

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Nobody make
a goddamn sound.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
The what?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
The itis.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That's what you call it

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
when you get sleepy
after a big meal.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
The itis?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Hurry up, now!
I ain't got all day! Move it!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
You know, Robert,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I own a little health food spot
near Meadowlark Park.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I said, let's go!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Great location,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
but the food tastes like
hot armpit on wheat bread.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I've been thinking
about making a change.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
You interested?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Do you want us to
take you to the safe?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
My own restaurant.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Mm-hm.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Hm? Oh, right. Right.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Uh...

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
That's a great idea, Robert.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, the safe. Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You know what's even
a better idea is

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
a lounge singer.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I sing, Robert.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I could...

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I could sing to the people
while they--

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Hurry up!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
RILEY:
It should have beds

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Come on!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
instead of tables--

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
--so after people eat,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Twenty-two minutes.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
We suck.
We fuckin' suck, man.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
they could just pass out.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And I forgot to ask
for the money again.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Good idea.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
We should get together
tomorrow and talk.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I always forget to ask
for the money.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I don't think
22 minutes is so bad.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
My own r-restra...

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Not so bad?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
That's a whole episode
of  Seinfeld.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Huey, you handle the dishes.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It takes us a whole episode
of  Sein-fuckin'-feld

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
to rob a bank!

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Stop being
a perfectionist.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Ed, we both know

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
if your grandfather
didn't own this bank,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
WUNCLER:
I'm telling you, Robert,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
we'd never have gotten away
with this shit.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
this is the best location
in Woodcrest.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Shut up, Riley!
Rummy, you the man.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I own all the businesses
on this block.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Excuse me. But will you
be needing anything else

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
from me today,
Mr. Wuncler, sir?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Everything except
Meadowlark Memorial Park.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Nah, you can go on
and take the bags back in.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I've been trying to buy
that park for years,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Thank you, sir.
And for what it's worth,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I thought you all did very well.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
but the state is trying
to buttfuck me on the price.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
See? An unbiased
opinion.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
But we'll see
who buttfucks who.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So you honestly think that
was a well-executed robbery?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Wow.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I didn't know
Meadowlark Lemon died.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I sure do.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Who's Meadowlark Lemon?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
And you wouldn't just be saying
that 'cause I got a loaded gun

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I found that the whole
health-food thing

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
pointin' at you, would ya?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
'Cause we need honest
feedback, for real.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
attracts the wrong kind
of crowd.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Hello, Mr. Wuncler.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
No, sir. I would not.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Hello.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Cutie pie, hello.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Excuse me, gentlemen.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Would you like to sign
our petition to get

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
more humane treatment
for immigrant workers?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
That's bullshit.
We fuckin' suck, man.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
If you don't get
that bullshit

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
out of my face, bitch...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
: The life of a black hero

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Chico, take an order.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
has never been for the meek of heart.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Ah,  sí, señor.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Seventeen pigs,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
You will not
get out of here alive!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
75 pounds of butter,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
one and a half tons
of grease.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Do you hear me?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Sound like a good start?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Mm-hm.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I need to be thinking urban.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm goin' to Ed's house!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
And I said, no!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
More Negro.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
The black thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
That's what's happening
now with the kids.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Mm-hm.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Aagh!
Ugh-ugh!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Eh.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Everyone,
listen up.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I'd like to introduce you
to my new partner,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Ugh!

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Robert Free-man.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
We're going to be opening
a soul-food restaurant together.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
MAN: Hey, all right.
MAN 2: Oh, soul food!

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You little bitch!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay, so...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
you...are all fired.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
ALL:
Ooh.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
WUNCLER:
Everyone else,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I hate your kind.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Never come back.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Congratulations, Robert.
This is gonna be great.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Uh,  Señor  Wuncler.
Are we fired too?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Not the Mexicans.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm half Mexican.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Ugh! Agh!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
WUNCLER:
Not the illegal Mexicans.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
ILLEGAL MEXICANS: ¡Olé!

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Uh-oh.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
GRANDDAD:
Mm-hm.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Ow!

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Mm-hm.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
GRANDDAD:
Boys!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
What the hell?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I ain't doing nothin',
Granddad.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I present to you
"The Luther."

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I was just gonna go
to Ed's house,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
A full-pound burger patty
covered in cheese,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
and Huey said I couldn't go
'cause he a hater.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
grilled onion,
five strips of bacon,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
What the hell is wrong
with you, Huey?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
all sandwiched between--

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
If your brother wants to play
with Ed and Rummy,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Two doughnuts!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
that's his business.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Two Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Granddad...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Ed and Rummy are
international criminals.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It's called the Luther

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
because it was supposed
to have been invented

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
There he go,
hatin' again.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
by Mr. Luther Vandross himself.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Boys, stop hatin'!

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
What about the time
when Riley and Ed

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Luther Vandross
is dead.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
were playing
with a loaded shotgun,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
And? What's your point?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Hm?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and Riley shot Ed out of
a second-story window?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Is this one
of your menus?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Huaagh!

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Sausage and waffle
and fried chicken

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
breakfast lasagna?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Ohhh.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yep.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Bacon-wrapped
chitlin-stuffed catfish?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That did happen, didn't it?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Okay. So just 'cause Ed believes
in his Second Amendment right

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad, you can't serve
this kind of food to people.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
It'll cause...death.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
to bear arms,
we can't be friends?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Whoa.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
What you got against
the Bill of Rights, Huey?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
This is what crack
must feel like.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay. How 'bout the time
they stopped for gas

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Shame on you, Huey.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
and ended up robbin'
the mini-mart?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Move out to the suburbs,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
and suddenly you too good
for soul food.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Perhaps you would enjoy
a spot of cheese

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
MAN:
Agh.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
RILEY:
They was fighting terrorism.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and a buttered scone,
white boy.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Makin' the world safe for the
freedoms that we enjoy today.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
That's messed up. You don't
support the troops, Huey.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Boy? Boy, are you okay?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
That is kind of
messed up, Huey.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm sure it's
just the itis, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Be back by dinner.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
That or insulin shock.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Ha!

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Do CPR.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Riley, wake up!

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, I'm not sure
yellin' at him

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm just sayin'
we can do better.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
is gonna help, Granddad.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
We're not realizing
our potential.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
How do you not know CPR?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
This is some bullshit.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I tried to learn CPR,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
The game cheatin'!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
but they wouldn't let me.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Nigga, the game ain't cheatin'.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
'Cause I was black.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
What?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Start the game over.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Nowadays, y'all run around
and learn CPR

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Why you always gotta cheat
when you lose, Ed?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
whenever y'all want to.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Just go around
savin' lives,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Let him have it.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
It's not wise to upset
a Wuncler.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
resuscitatin' each other
willy-nilly.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
But when I was a young man,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
it used to be against the law

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
to teach colored folks CPR,
okay?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Man, that's not true!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Restart the game now!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Granddad...

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
is that you?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Oh, boy,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I thought we lost you
there for a second.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And Oprah fans get ready.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
How was the Luther?

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
The queen of daytime talk will be in the Woodcrest area

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Best...thing...ever.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
tomorrow for a book signing,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Sounds like an endorsement
to me.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
before taping her show the following evening.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Hundreds of Oprah faithfuls have been camping out

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
for days in anticipation.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I just think she is--

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
She is the most wonderful spirit.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I just don't know what I would do without her.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
RUMMY:
Oh, snap!

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Now, look at y'all.
Just purty as a couple can be.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
What if we kidnap Oprah?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
How many in your party?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
And do what?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Control of Oprah
is control over women.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Just us.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And how long of a nap

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Wait. I see where
you're goin'.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
will you be takin'?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
See, 'cause, like,
control over women

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, we were thinking
maybe 45 minutes.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
is control over bitches.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
That's just great.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Head on in.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Oprah Winfrey
taps directly into

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
MAN:
Tonight is pork-produced sushi.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
the emotions, beliefs,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Hold on to your wasabi

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
buying habits
and summer reading patterns

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
as we take you
to a super-exclusive

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
of billions of women
all over the world.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
grand opening of The Itis!

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Oprah Winfrey has the power
to lay waste

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
A new place to see
or be seen in Woodcrest.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
to an entire industry
with a mere utterance.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
With the maître d'

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
who might be causing
all the ruckus,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
She's a completely
invincible,

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Uncle Ruckus.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
unstoppable
force of nature.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
En français,  my good man.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
And with her under our control,
nobody will be able to stop us.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
That's Uncle "Rue-kue."

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It's French.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm part French
and Cherokee Indian,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Who's trying to stop you?
Nobody ever tries to stop you.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
with just a splish-splash
of Irish.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I-I know Irish.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes, they do.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Sometimes I drink Hennessy,
and I make booty calls!

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
No, they don't.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Hey, just because we don't know
anyone tryin' to stop us,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
All right, Rue-Kue.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
don't mean ain't nobody
out there tryin' to stop us.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What's Robert Freeman's secret?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
The absence of evidence is
not the evidence of absence.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, let me just say
this here.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Seems to me like everyone

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
If there's one thing that
a colored man is good at,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
just let's y'all
do whatever you want.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
it's cookin' a pig.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
That's why y'all
always get away.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
There you have it--

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
We get away because I'm  a criminal mastermind.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That ain't to say
a white man

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
couldn't cook a pig better.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Whatever, nigga.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
His big brain just focused
on more important things,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Get ready.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
like runnin' the world
and spaceships.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
We get her
at the bookstore.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
We gonna need some
video surveillance.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
And  we gonna need
advanced communication.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Two-way pagers
for everybody.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah!

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Whatever you guys
are plannin',

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
oh, you're such
a wonderful crowd.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
you're not gettin' away
with it.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Nobody can stop
Ed and Rummy.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
My name is Tommy D,
hip-hop lounge singer,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Maybe not.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
But if I catch you
with 'em,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
and I'll be providing

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm gonna take you down.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
your listening pleasure
this evening.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Unless I take you
down first.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And right now,
I'd like to slow it on down

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
"Unless I take

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
you down first."

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
with my main man, Biz Markie.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Is that the best you can do?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Shut up, punk.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
With your mouth, Biz

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
WOMAN:
I just saw--

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I saw a glimpse of her.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh, my God.
She's in there.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
With your mouth, Biz

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
MAN:
Oh, she looks fantastic.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
HUEY:
Excuse me, brother.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
RILEY:
Okay.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
There's two guards
by the front door.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Mind if I have a word
with you

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
about some of the so-called

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
"food" you're servin'
this evenin'?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
TOM:

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
RILEY:
Another on the east wall.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And here's the man himself.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Robert, these two ladies
wanted to meet

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
ED:
Well, excuse me

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
for being into computers
and shit, all right?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
the man behind The Itis.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Well!

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
First of all,
motherfucker,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
just because you put
a two-way pager

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Hello there, cutie pie.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
in the middle
of your desk,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Hi.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
don't make it a computer.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
My name is Janet,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It's a two-way pager,
all right?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and I just can't begin
to tell you

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Okay. Then what's
the difference?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
how fantastic your food is.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
The difference is
a computer is something

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
GRANDDAD:
Oh.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
that does actual work.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Thank you, kindly.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
With your...

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Nigga technology don't do much
more than let dumb niggas

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
talk to other dumb niggas

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
about dumb-nigga shit.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
WOMAN:
She even smells good.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Biz.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
RILEY:
Hey. I see Oprah.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Listen, I don't want
to keep you,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Okay, her security
just left her alone. Go.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
but I'm sure that you will be
seeing a lot more of me.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Let's roll.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Bitches love free food,
Robert.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
MAN:
Oh, my God!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Hey, where you goin'?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Bed four needs more bacon.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Oh!

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What did you tell him?
What's behind your back?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Get down!

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
RUMMY:
Everybody get down, now!

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Elijah Muhammad's
"How to Eat to Live."

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
ED:
Where's Oprah?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I knew it!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Just what joy do you get

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
RUMMY:
Well? Where she at?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
out of trying to crush
all of my dreams, Huey?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
ED:
Where's Oprah?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Do you know how long
I've wanted

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
RUMMY:
I'm gonna start bustin'

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
some caps in some ass.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
to own my own restaurant?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Three weeks, at Sunday dinner.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
ED:
Where's Oprah, punk?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That was the first time
you mentioned it,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
and you only started doin'
the stupid Sunday dinner thing

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Kee-yah, bitch!

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
RUMMY:
Don't look. Just tell me

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
where that bitch is!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
because you saw Soul Food  on cable.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Somebody needs to tell me

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
HUEY: We're gonna pause this

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
where Oprah is
on the count of three, or--

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
for the benefit of all y'all who never saw  Soul Food.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Or-- Or I'm gonna kill
the oldest bitch up in here!

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Soul Food  is a movie

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
about a big, humongous black grandmother,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
aptly named Big Mama.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
That's real fucked up,
Agnes.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Big Mama demonstrates her love

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
ED:
I found her!

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
by feeding herself and her offspring

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
No! Help me!

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
enormous amounts of pig lard.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Body Snatcher Three
to Body Snatcher Two,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Then--

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Get this.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
where are you?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
--Big Mama's arteries are so clogged,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
We're in the bookstore.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
they gotta amputate her arm.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
We're about to extract
the package.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
RILEY: What bookstore?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
GRANDDAD: It was her leg!

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
HUEY: Right. Okay, whatever. Leg.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
The Borders next to Starbucks.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
No, it's the Barnes & Noble

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Then she dies of a heart attack.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
next to The Coffee Bean.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Or another stroke or somethin'.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Kee-yah, bitch!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
MAN:
God called her home.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
HUEY: And what does the family do

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
after she dies?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
They get together for a Sunday dinner

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Rummy, wait!

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and eat the same food that just killed Big Mama.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
That's not Oprah! Hello?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
The same food!

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Damn it.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
They didn't learn a lesson. Nobody went on a diet.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
RUMMY:
Body Snatcher Two

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
to Body Snatcher Three,
you read me?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And that's the end of the movie.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Sunday dinners was my idea.
They got that from me.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Hey. Kick me again--
Oh! goddamn it.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Something wrong?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
RUMMY: I'm gonna bust your ass.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Look, Ed,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
"Dear Ed...

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I'm sorry.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
"that...is not...Oprah.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
We just lost a waiter,
a-and...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Robert, relax.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Riley."

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Look around.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Yo, Rummy. Riley said
that ain't Oprah.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
What? Well, then
who the hell is she?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Oh! Goddamn it!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
It's, uh,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
"Maya...Angelou."

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Maya "And I rise" Angelou?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, I still have
to replace that waiter.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Mm-hm.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
I am so mad at you. Hmph!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Ugh.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Wha--

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
HUEY: What people soon discovered

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
was that Granddad's food was as addictive as it was tasty.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
: This was the scene today

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
at the Woodcrest Borders bookstore,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
where two unknown assailants

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
The restaurant was booked solid around the clock.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
kidnapped Maya Angelou during a book signing.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It was all
Rummy's fault!

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
People started to show up late for work.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Ed ran into the wrong store.
I was followin' Ed.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
How was I supposed to know
which bookstore to go into?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Others stopped going to work altogether.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
They look exactly the same,
and they both got books.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
There was a giant crowd
of people outside of one.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That don't mean
Oprah was in there.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
There was a large sign outside
that said, "Welcome Oprah."

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Jobs were lost.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Y'all are lucky Ed's grandfather
owns the cops.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
The Itis addicts who couldn't afford the beds

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Just what are you tryin'
to imply?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
moved into Meadowlark Park.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Look, we escaped capture

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Without jobs,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
they turned to crime to feed their habit.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
because of planning,
teamwork and execution.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
A month after The Itis opened,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Meadowlark Park had its first mugging.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
This officer wanted
to see you,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
No, no!

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Mr. Wuncler, sir.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Stop! Stop!
Give me that!

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Wuncler,
I-I just--

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Well, y-- You dropped
this today at the bookstore

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Hello?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
911?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
during the-- Y-you know.
The unpleasant, uh...

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I've been mugged!

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
It took 3 hours for the police to arrive.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Th-- Thank you, Mr. Wuncler,
sir. Thank you.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Uh, I'm so sorry
to disturb you.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
This was officially a bad neighborhood.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I-- I hope you're
not upset with me.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Why don't we just get
Oprah tomorrow?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Anybody know where
they're taping?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Maybe we could
try and find out?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I'm down with that.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh. This is beautiful.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
It's like we back again.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry.
You know, uh,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
sometimes I just let my emotions
get the best of me.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
No, no, no, no,
I understand.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
You passionate
about what you're doin'.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
I just wish you'd be a little
more sensitive to my feelings.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Ow!

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
It was my fault, man.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
You bitch!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh, you--

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
No, no, no, it was my fault
for grabbing...

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Stay away
from my food!

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
the poet triumvirate,
whatever her name--

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
GRANDDAD:
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Maya-- Maya.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Don't damage
the floor!

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Y'all niggas are gay.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
WOMAN:
Hey, Granddaddy,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
it's me,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Hey, why y'all
leave me out here?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Hey!
Janet.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
We met on opening night.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
One of y'all motherfuckers

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Damn!

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
better come out here
and get me, I know that.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
What happened to you?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Look, I was just wondering

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Or you will be living
in a haunted house tonight.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
if I could get
a quick Luther burger.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Swim, bitch!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Hey, come on, get off me!

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Please.
Look, just one.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Now, this is the studio where
they be taping the show.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
What's wrong
with you, woman?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
What we need to worry about is
Oprah's personal security team.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Hey, get off my leg!

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
You got one in that bag,
don't you?!

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Do we have any intel on that?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Please, Granddaddy.
I'll do anything!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Any what?
Intel.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Then take the damn thing!

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Intelligence, nigga.
Keep up.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
GRANDDAD:
Damn!

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
The bookstore
security footage.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
That was my dinner.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Help!

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
RUMMY:
Whoa. Bushido Brown.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Aw, damn,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
I was afraid of this.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Who's Bushido Brown?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
A bona fide bad motherfucker,
that's who.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
You remember when Oprah
made them comments

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
about the beef industry?
No.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Don't worry
about last night.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Okay. Well, a few years back,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
We'll get you
some security.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Oprah said some shit
on her show about beef.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
This ain't exactly

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
the best neighborhood
anymore,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You know, mad cow disease,
or some shit.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
but we have
a bigger problem.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Anyway, the beef industry didn't
exactly find that shit amusing.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
We're losing money
because you're not getting

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
They thought they would send a crew of armed Texans

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
these people out of here
fast enough.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
to go teach Oprah a lesson.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Like him.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Get your ass up,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
or pay for another hour
in the bed! Now!

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Ex-Marines, ex-Texas Rangers,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I can't...

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
rogues, that kind of shit.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.000
Chico!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But Oprah hired Bushido Brown

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh, God.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
as her personal bodyguard.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
There.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
MAN:
Come on.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Come on, Jay-Z.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Look like a bed
just opened up.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Check this out.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I had Chico modify the bed

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
MAN 2:
We got him.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
like the Mexicans do
with their cars.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
They call it...

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
RUMMY: Apparently,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
"hydraulics."

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
only one dude was able to actually lay a hand

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Watch this.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
on Oprah's office door.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yahhh!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
They say...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Bushido Brown
kept that hand.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Let's see.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I think
I just shit myself.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Um, this is
my first time here,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
but all my friends
rave about it.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
No, no.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
What's good?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh, everything here
will kill you.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
We can't just stroll up
in there

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Run.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
if Bushido Brown is there.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
We need a plan.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Fine.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
And, um...

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
You wanna
keep playin' around?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
go change your pants.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Now, you can wash
the dishes.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Granddad, look what you've
done to this community.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
HUEY:
Pretty strange, huh?

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Armed gunmen assault
a bookstore

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It's not that bad.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Not that bad?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
This place used to sit

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
to kidnap Maya Angelou.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
between a coffee shop
and a day spa.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Hey, I heard she had enemies.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Now, there's a liquor store
and a damn Foot Locker.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Even stranger,
Oprah Winfrey

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
This food is destructive.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
This food is your culture.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
was right across the street
when it happened.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't know anything about
no plot to kidnap nobody.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Then the culture is destructive.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
CHICO:
He's right,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Señor  Freeman.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
So Ed and Rummy do have
a plan to kidnap Oprah.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
All African-American slaves
had to eat

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
was the parts of the pigs

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
the slaves' masters
wouldn't eat,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
but that was
a survival technique,  ese.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
They didn't really have
a choice.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't think people are
supposed to eat this stuff.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Or, at least, not so much.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
What?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I can't take
an Afro-American Studies class

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Damn.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
at the community college?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Well, nobody asked you, Chico.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
This is my restaurant,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and we'll serve the food
that I wanna serve,  señor.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Actually,
it's my restaurant,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
HUEY: I call it the Black Power Fist.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and it's shutting down.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Sorry, Robert.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
The Black Power Fist is actually a stun glove

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It was fun while it lasted.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
that I made with instructions I found on the Internet.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
But, uh, w-what happened?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
HUEY: Granddad learned white people

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
It delivers thousands of volts

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
of imperialism-stopping electricity

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
had their own survival techniques.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
without the need of superpowers

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
They call it "litigation."

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
or secret alien technology.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Janet O'Siren had gone from this,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
And it's inexpensive enough to fit well within

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
to this...

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
even the most frugal revolutionary's defense budget.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
and back to this,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
with the help of two liposuctions

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and emergency gastrointestinal surgery.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
We want half a million
for medical bills

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
and 4 million
in emotional damages.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
We'll pay
her insurance deductible.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Deal.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Okay, so we're gonna enter
at the rear service entrance.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
And, um-- Ahem.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
--one last Luther burger.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
They'd never expect us
to go through there,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Chico!

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
because it's in back.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Wuncler feared it would be

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
the first of many lawsuits against The Itis.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Whoa. Hm.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Didn't think
they'd put guards there.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Granddad's restaurant was no more.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
They really covered
their bases.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So that's it?
That's the plan?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Mmm, mmm! Oh!

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Now what?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This isn't fair.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I didn't think they'd think
to put guards at the rear.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
The people liked
this restaurant,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That was a unknown unknown.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and they liked me.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
It was a bad plan.
You plan things badly.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I never wanted
to hurt anybody.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Isn't this
your brother?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Janet, are you okay?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I think she's having
a heart attack.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I believe
our business is done.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Have a nice day.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Call me later,
Robert.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
What's he
doin' here?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
He's tryin' to stop you.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Hello.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Really?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
911?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Why? What we ever
do to him?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
My client's having
a heart attack.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Sound like
a hater to me.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
They're not gonna come.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Yes. We're on the corner
of, um, uh,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Hello?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Cherry Street
and-- And Fifth.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Yes. There's a little boy coming
right now to hurt Oprah.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Right across
from Meadowlark Park.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Hello?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
He's got a big stupid afro
and a very poor disposition.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Told you.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Don't you know CPR?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
He's on the east side
of the building.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm a lawyer.
We don't help people.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
A'ight, peace.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
What about you guys?
Don't you know CPR?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Okay, we're
on the move.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Let's go.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
GRANDDAD:
So I told him,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
they wouldn't even teach
black people CPR

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
when I was young.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
All right, the game's up.
It's over.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
You're not going anywhere.
It's all right.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
HUEY: We still do the Sunday dinners.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I think Granddad just likes being popular.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Oprah's in danger.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
But we do switch up the menu from week to week.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Not while I'm here.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I have to get into
that studio,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
It's somethin'.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
even if it means
goin' through you.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
So, what happened?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Chico saved her.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Man, you come straight
out of a comic strip.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Eh. I took a class.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And after this meal, nobody passed out.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
If you'll excuse me.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Robert,
may I use--?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
WUNCLER:
Bathroom's upstairs, right?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
GRANDDAD:
Huey!

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Take care of
the dishes, okay?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Don't anybody go
in the bathroom

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Uh!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
for 35 or 45 minutes.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Hooo...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Whew!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Open the window!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
ya!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
All right.
WOMAN:

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
No running in here.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Aagh!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yaaa...hoo!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
GUARD:
Why me?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Huh?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Okay, Oprah's dressing room
should be up here

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
and to the left.
Let's go.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Aah!

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Ugh! Ugh! Wha--?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Agh!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Say what?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Intruders in the studio?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I am on my way.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
GUARD: Let's go.
GUARD 2: I'm comin'.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
ED:
Kee-yah, bitch!

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Pull up your pants,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
you little ghetto hooligan.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Damn. Is that
who I think it is?

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
This ain't Oprah.
It's Bill Cosby.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I guess we were supposed to
take a left.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
COSBY:
What's the matter

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
with you?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Kicking in the doors

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
with the big boots
and the guns.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Damn, Rummy. I'm sick
of playing with y'all.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Y'all two are pathetic.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Hey, in Iraq we was in
Special Ops.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Y'all niggas should have been
in the Special Olympics.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I'm goin' home.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, come on, man. Look,
we'll kidnap Bill Cosby.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It'll still be fun.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, man, it's only 4:00.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Come on. We can write
the ransom note together.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't think so, guys.
I gotta get home for dinner.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
RILEY: Later.
COSBY:

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
...with their parents...

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Don't listen to him,
he's just a hater.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
You a good planner.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Look, you about to
kidnap  Bill Cosby.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
How many motherfuckers
can say

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
that they did some shit
like that, huh?

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
You gotta start lookin'
at the bright side.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah. Sure
you're right.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I am a pretty good
planner, huh?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
RILEY:
And y'all niggas are gay.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
COSBY:
--to the wall. I--

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
You know, I just--
Oh, no.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Man. This-- This reminds me
of when I...

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
HUEY: Ed and Rummy kidnapped

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Bill Cosby.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
But he was really annoying,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
so they returned him to the studio 15 minutes later.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
COSBY:
I'm upset with you

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
for comin' in here...

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
HUEY: As usual, nobody even

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
thought about stopping them.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
What the fuck
y'all lookin' at?

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Riley had gotten away, but returned

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
several hours later when he realized

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
he had dropped his two-way pager.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay, okay, okay.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Let me explain.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
You must have lost your mind!
Ow! Oh! Ow!

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
You do not--
Hey, man! Just let me-- Ow!

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
--kidnap Oprah!
