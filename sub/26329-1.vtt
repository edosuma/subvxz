<i>"Through me you pass
into the city of woe.</i>

01:11.426 --> 01:15.028

02:06.056 --> 02:08.306
And now you've listened
to that powerful reading,

02:08.824 --> 02:10.833
can anyone tell me
why Dante's Inferno

02:10.858 --> 02:13.263
is still so important today?

02:16.959 --> 02:18.787
Am I to abandon all hope?

02:20.819 --> 02:21.724
Lawrence.

02:21.889 --> 02:23.428
Because he imagined hell.

02:23.576 --> 02:24.569
Yeah.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.256
Yeah, because he imagined hell.

02:27.717 --> 02:29.795
He shared with us a version of

02:29.865 --> 02:33.060
man's experience and
relationship to existence

02:33.115 --> 02:35.545
to his sins, to his own mortality.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.443
I mean, you all come here,
ladies and gentlemen

02:37.529 --> 02:40.396
to get lost in the classics and
be inspired by the great masters

02:40.514 --> 02:42.545
but also to begin and to

02:42.647 --> 02:45.749
try to make sense of your own

02:45.858 --> 02:47.999
descent into hell.

02:48.374 --> 02:52.944
So, instead of the usual critical
analysis of Dante's Inferno,

02:53.014 --> 02:55.788
I would like you
to provide me with an

02:55.874 --> 02:58.717
alternative poetic proposal

02:58.990 --> 03:01.170
to Dante's Hell.

03:02.522 --> 03:03.865
Your own.

03:04.233 --> 03:07.451
Your struggles,
your fears, your sins

03:07.506 --> 03:09.209
whatever they may be.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.201
Oh, and uh...

03:11.529 --> 03:13.061
I want it by Monday.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.904
Yeah, good weekend.

03:17.014 --> 03:17.959
All right.

03:18.779 --> 03:19.701
Thanks.

03:20.998 --> 03:22.170
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes.

03:22.209 --> 03:23.850
Oh, really?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.856
Oh, hello, Susan. Thanks.

03:25.911 --> 03:27.911
Aren't you the hippest
professor of them all?

03:28.801 --> 03:31.785
Darling, I would never dare
take that title away from you.

03:32.323 --> 03:35.120
Well, I didn't just publish a book.
That obviously helped.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.026
Don't worry, by this time next week,
they would have forgotten all about it.

03:39.189 --> 03:41.548
There's a rectoral dinner
at my place tonight.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.389
Select professors only.
Please come.

03:44.436 --> 03:48.123
Ah, I'm afraid I can't tonight.
I have plans.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.186
-Plans?
-Mm-hmm.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.936
I imagine they're not staying
at home correcting exams.

03:53.922 --> 03:55.137
Not exactly.

03:55.747 --> 03:58.005
-Have a good weekend.
-You too.

04:21.497 --> 04:23.622
Do you mind giving me
a lift, Professor?

05:10.777 --> 05:12.808
-Are you sleeping?
-Mmm.

05:16.277 --> 05:18.191
Why do you smell so good?

05:21.917 --> 05:24.339
I'd like to stay like this

05:24.394 --> 05:25.761
forever.

05:26.628 --> 05:29.074
Not move, just stay here.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.013
I don't think my publisher
would be too happy about that.

05:32.052 --> 05:34.748
He has other writers,
he'll get over it.

05:37.584 --> 05:39.881
You'll have to give up
going to university.

05:40.116 --> 05:42.452
-Mm, I wouldn't mind.
-You wouldn't mind?

05:42.581 --> 05:43.542
No.

05:43.769 --> 05:45.566
We'll never be able
to make love again.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.433
If it's only for that, we'll move.

06:03.421 --> 06:05.296
How long have we been together?

06:07.365 --> 06:10.592
I don't know, um, almost a year?

06:12.030 --> 06:12.967
Thirteen months.

06:13.210 --> 06:14.952
-Thirteen months?
-Mmm.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.603
And no one knows.

06:19.228 --> 06:20.142
So?

06:22.541 --> 06:24.619
Do you love me, Samuel?

06:28.204 --> 06:29.469
What sort of question is that?

06:29.517 --> 06:31.923
-Don't laugh, I'm being serious.
-Well...

06:32.235 --> 06:33.462
I mean it.

06:34.356 --> 06:38.731
If you loved me, you wouldn't be
hiding from everyone all the time.

06:41.793 --> 06:42.793
No.

06:44.449 --> 06:47.996
But then the entire university
would be gossiping about us.

06:50.407 --> 06:51.938
Is that what you want?

06:52.266 --> 06:54.430
Just, I don't want
this ever to end.

06:54.586 --> 06:55.719
Neither do I.

07:02.429 --> 07:03.975
Then promise me.

07:05.944 --> 07:07.890
You'll love me forever.

07:11.561 --> 07:12.569
Okay.

07:12.718 --> 07:13.905
Say it.

07:15.554 --> 07:16.444
I promise.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.272
Not like that, say it.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.264
I promise.

07:28.287 --> 07:30.186
I will love you forever.

07:39.562 --> 07:40.476
Bye.

07:47.664 --> 07:48.758
Oh, hello.

07:49.632 --> 07:50.680
Hello.

07:51.422 --> 07:52.648

07:54.383 --> 07:55.797

I'm gonna have to pop out.

08:28.311 --> 08:30.765
What do you say, I pick up
some takeaway on my way back?

08:42.986 --> 08:43.979
No, no.

08:44.956 --> 08:46.433
Oh, my God, what have you done?

08:47.723 --> 08:49.645
Beatriz? Beatriz, come on!

12:23.932 --> 12:24.932
Empty.

13:24.068 --> 13:26.631
I know, but this is the reference,
that's what I'm saying.

13:26.712 --> 13:28.283
I missed it, perhaps, ma'am.

13:28.752 --> 13:30.666
You think you can manage?

13:30.861 --> 13:32.806
Yeah, sure, I'll catch you later.

13:39.681 --> 13:40.603
Hey.

13:41.423 --> 13:44.071
Here I was thinking I would never
see you around here again.

13:44.387 --> 13:46.598
Well, I'm sure there
are some people...

13:46.832 --> 13:48.794
who'd be delighted
if that were the case.

13:50.501 --> 13:52.016
I don't think that's true.

13:53.579 --> 13:54.719
How are you?

13:55.313 --> 13:57.430
Does that offer for
dinner still stand?

13:58.954 --> 14:00.087
Of course.

14:03.909 --> 14:04.987

14:07.402 --> 14:09.003
How long have you
been having them?

14:09.089 --> 14:10.745
Every night

14:11.089 --> 14:14.332
for the past... three weeks.

14:14.597 --> 14:16.550
Are you seeing anyone
to help you with this?

14:16.667 --> 14:17.769
First, I had a

14:17.824 --> 14:20.675
a grief counselor but I decided
that wasn't really for me.

14:21.421 --> 14:23.070
I'm sure it has
occurred to you that

14:23.133 --> 14:26.007
these dreams might have
something to do with

14:26.070 --> 14:27.711
what happened.

14:30.004 --> 14:32.262
The woman in my dreams
looks nothing like Beatriz.

14:32.293 --> 14:35.551
No, what I mean is like, y-your
head is trying to get rid of

14:35.613 --> 14:38.390
the pain that's inside you,
like, you know, therapy.

14:38.429 --> 14:40.523
It's got nothing
to do with that, okay?

14:42.895 --> 14:44.763
Have you written anything?

14:45.255 --> 14:46.770
I've got nothing to say.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.957
Pfff.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.559
Write about your dream.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.427
Oh, sure. I'll become
a horror writer.

14:52.473 --> 14:55.660
What's wrong about that?
Horror writers are sexy.

14:55.731 --> 14:56.848
Come on.

14:57.227 --> 15:00.180
Poets are starving, boring.

15:00.289 --> 15:03.031
Oh, on that note,

15:03.133 --> 15:06.320
I got that for your birthday
and then you disappeared, so...

15:06.477 --> 15:08.180
better late than never.

15:08.297 --> 15:09.727
Happy birthday to you.

15:13.109 --> 15:14.461
Open it.

15:17.911 --> 15:19.497
Now, that's what I call pressure.

15:19.685 --> 15:23.138
Come on, use it for
your grocery list.

15:23.793 --> 15:27.238
Or to correct exams.

15:29.139 --> 15:31.873
You are a professor, remember?

15:32.076 --> 15:33.608
And a good one, so.

15:33.717 --> 15:35.740
Why don't you stop
biting your nails?

15:36.443 --> 15:37.521
Fuck you.

16:08.449 --> 16:09.565
You miss me already?

16:09.605 --> 16:11.503
<i>Are you at home? Samuel?</i>

16:11.558 --> 16:12.777
Yeah, just got back.

16:12.886 --> 16:14.167
<i>Switch on the TV.</i>

16:14.324 --> 16:16.527
<i>The local news channel.
Quick.</i>

16:16.589 --> 16:18.378
-Why?
-<i>Just do it.</i>

16:18.910 --> 16:20.902
-<i>Do it!</i>
-Okay, okay.

16:29.070 --> 16:29.805
<i>Do you have it?</i>

16:29.859 --> 16:31.406
<i>Murder has shaken the quiet</i>

16:31.438 --> 16:33.274
-Yeah.
-<i>sleepy suburb of Ballsbridge.</i>

16:33.398 --> 16:34.804
<i>A Garda spokesman has said</i>

16:34.898 --> 16:38.132
<i>that the badly beaten corpse
was found on the second story</i>

16:38.359 --> 16:42.397
<i>surrounded by what appears to be a
makeshift white circle on the floor.</i>

16:42.470 --> 16:46.847
<i>Gardaí believe the event has all the
hallmarks of a ritual-type killing.</i>

16:46.926 --> 16:47.887
<i>Samuel?</i>

16:47.941 --> 16:49.808
<i>-Further forensic investigation
-Samuel?</i>

16:49.833 --> 16:53.012
<i>to establish the exact course of
events is currently underway.</i>

16:58.452 --> 17:00.413
She was killed
a couple of days ago.

17:00.505 --> 17:02.169
And apparently a
cleaning lady found her

17:02.232 --> 17:03.350
when she arrived in the morning.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.303
Okay.

17:04.366 --> 17:07.545
She was an Italian lady
and her name, uh...

17:07.585 --> 17:08.865
her name is Lidia Garetti

17:08.921 --> 17:10.599
and this is the woman
I saw in my dreams.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.303
This is her. I am positive.

17:12.329 --> 17:15.032
Samuel, do you realize
how incredible this is?

17:15.127 --> 17:16.050
Yes.

17:16.096 --> 17:18.988
You dreamt about something that
was going to happen before it did.

17:19.059 --> 17:21.542
<i>Before</i> it did.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.589
That's called a
premonitory dream.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.958
But why me? Why?

17:25.019 --> 17:26.964
-I-I don't even know this woman.
-I don't know.

17:27.019 --> 17:29.246
There has to be an explanation.
We'll figure it out.

17:29.271 --> 17:30.082
No, we will not.

17:30.121 --> 17:32.098
This is not one of your
esoteric adventures.

17:32.123 --> 17:33.795
This woman is dead.
This is real.

17:33.866 --> 17:35.577
And I saw how it happened.

17:35.602 --> 17:36.753
Really? What are you gonna do?

17:36.877 --> 17:38.612
Who are you going to talk to-
the police?

17:38.722 --> 17:41.096
What are you going to say?
"Hi, inspector, um...

17:41.174 --> 17:43.635
"I know what happened to the
Italian woman in Ballsbridge.

17:43.705 --> 17:46.408
"I wasn't there, but
I saw it in my dream."

17:47.165 --> 17:49.250
Do you realize what
that looks like?

17:49.368 --> 17:50.641
It's crazy.

21:00.583 --> 21:01.379
Wait!

21:02.069 --> 21:02.897
Wait!

21:03.273 --> 21:04.015
Stop!

21:04.265 --> 21:05.054
-No!
-Stop!

21:05.221 --> 21:06.463
No! Please don't hurt me!

21:06.667 --> 21:07.487
Please don't hurt me.

21:07.652 --> 21:08.237
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:08.464 --> 21:09.620
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:09.886 --> 21:11.441
Just tell me what
you're doing here.

21:13.222 --> 21:14.980
Are y-you a policeman?

21:15.084 --> 21:18.287
No, no, I'm... I'm...

21:19.420 --> 21:20.756
Wait, who are you?

21:20.974 --> 21:22.287
Were you stealing?

21:23.464 --> 21:24.206
No.

21:25.276 --> 21:26.229
No, I...

21:27.213 --> 21:30.830
I saw what happened
to that...woman on TV.

21:33.424 --> 21:35.049
Did you know her?

21:37.143 --> 21:38.963
No. No, no.

21:40.831 --> 21:42.011
Then why?

21:43.956 --> 21:45.034
What about you?

21:46.255 --> 21:48.130
If you're not with
the police, then...

21:51.540 --> 21:52.657
I just know it.

21:54.892 --> 21:57.010
You dreamt about it
too, didn't you?

22:06.821 --> 22:08.158
You have to see something.

22:09.076 --> 22:10.084
Follow me.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.570
Jesus Christ.

22:30.014 --> 22:31.412
Notice anything different?

22:31.858 --> 22:34.037
I realized as soon as I came in.

22:34.381 --> 22:35.936
Something was missing.

22:41.106 --> 22:42.465
-There.
-Yes.

22:43.442 --> 22:44.473
Those shelves.

22:45.567 --> 22:46.474
There was a...

22:47.356 --> 22:49.067
-There was a door.
-Exactly.

23:21.308 --> 23:22.332
Be careful.

23:28.945 --> 23:30.469
Oh, shit.

23:30.852 --> 23:32.102
It's the battery.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.242
-I've got some matches.
-Yeah?

23:34.492 --> 23:36.289
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

23:57.562 --> 23:58.577
Oh, Christ.

23:59.976 --> 24:02.577
Why on earth would you
keep an aquarium up here?

24:04.213 --> 24:05.166
Don't know.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.951
There's...

24:08.552 --> 24:10.084
There's something in there.

24:15.093 --> 24:16.164
What is that?

24:16.416 --> 24:17.546
Let's find out.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.916
Some kind of inscription on it.

24:33.662 --> 24:38.873
<i>"You see the beast that
made me turn aside"</i>

24:39.787 --> 24:42.459
That's... that's Dante.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.592
Yeah, that's right.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.409
Whoever killed her was
looking for something.

24:48.481 --> 24:49.762
You saw the house.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.418
This could be what they're after.

24:51.483 --> 24:53.178
But she wanted us to find it.

24:54.217 --> 24:56.100
That's why we had
the same dream.

24:56.554 --> 24:57.913
Think about it.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.431
Shit.

25:02.548 --> 25:03.454
Let's go.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.016
Hurry!

25:23.735 --> 25:24.548
Hey!

25:24.627 --> 25:25.525
Stop there!

25:25.810 --> 25:26.599
Stop!

25:27.385 --> 25:28.245
Stop!

26:38.440 --> 26:40.948
Tomorrow at 7:00.
There's a waiting list.

28:08.975 --> 28:11.225
<i>The White Ring was some
sort of experimental</i>

28:11.288 --> 28:13.186
<i>literary circle that
used to meet there.</i>

28:13.233 --> 28:15.780
And it seems some of
their concerns were too

28:15.913 --> 28:18.116
esoteric to be taken seriously.

28:19.612 --> 28:22.088
Shakespeare.
The impossible sonnets.

28:22.119 --> 28:24.346
Nobody's ever been able
to decipher them.

28:24.425 --> 28:26.691
-Including Shakespeare himself.
-Mm-hmm.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.994
He says they've been dictated
to him in his dreams

28:29.136 --> 28:31.253
-by a dark lady.
-Mm-hmm.

28:31.323 --> 28:34.323
Milton... my specialty.

28:35.135 --> 28:37.767
He tells of his experience
of meeting a lady

28:37.955 --> 28:40.612
by the name of Herberia on
the outskirts of Florence.

28:40.690 --> 28:41.401
Mm.

28:41.466 --> 28:45.029
According to him, she was the
inspiration for <i>Paradise Lost</i>.

28:45.558 --> 28:49.511
Keats, Blake, the
references are endless.

28:49.585 --> 28:53.304
They all hint at having had
some contact with the muses.

28:54.439 --> 28:57.017
-Number one invites.
-Mm-hmm.

28:57.509 --> 28:59.634
Number two invokes.

28:59.986 --> 29:01.728
Number three lies.

29:02.181 --> 29:04.657
Number four punishes.

29:04.939 --> 29:06.814
Number five foretells.

29:07.502 --> 29:09.587
Number six impassions.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.595
Number seven hides.

29:11.931 --> 29:13.267
The seven ladies.

29:13.369 --> 29:15.267
Yeah, the mystery of the muses.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.863
Is there more?

29:17.018 --> 29:20.933
Well, your friends through the White
Ring took the subject too far.

29:21.379 --> 29:23.550
For years they published
their theories

29:23.621 --> 29:25.770
in all sorts of
specialized magazines.

29:25.824 --> 29:28.067
First, in academic
circles, then in

29:28.130 --> 29:30.223
marginal occult publications.

29:30.270 --> 29:33.176
And in all of them, they
claim that they met them.

29:35.685 --> 29:36.989
What is this?

29:38.682 --> 29:42.456
Poetic inspiration taken from
nature in the form of a woman.

29:43.646 --> 29:47.756
Supernatural beings
of inconceivable evil.

29:49.075 --> 29:52.075
Immortal witches
invoking poetry

29:52.192 --> 29:54.106
through the use of spells.

30:00.151 --> 30:01.127
Okay.

30:02.142 --> 30:04.588
Well, do you think
we can find these guys?

30:04.821 --> 30:07.501
I could call Berkeley
through the department

30:08.325 --> 30:11.200
but I'm kind of getting
tired of being a secretary.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.449
You went to that house
without telling me.

30:13.543 --> 30:16.372
You found a treasure in
some kind of aquarium and

30:16.432 --> 30:19.096
suddenly a girl showed up
out of nowhere and took it.

30:19.696 --> 30:21.813
If I had been there, that
would not have happened.

30:21.876 --> 30:24.149
So, are you gonna help me
find these guys or what?

30:49.750 --> 30:50.679
Mom!

30:50.804 --> 30:51.929
What's that?

30:52.054 --> 30:54.968
Nothing. Just something I found.

30:57.288 --> 30:58.485
Are you annoyed?

30:58.579 --> 30:59.477
What?

30:59.697 --> 31:01.525
I don't know, you seem weird.

31:02.134 --> 31:03.587
What do you mean?

31:03.711 --> 31:05.430
No, baby, I'm just...

31:05.540 --> 31:07.228
pfff, I'm just tired, is all.

31:09.578 --> 31:11.727
You going to work tonight?

31:12.923 --> 31:14.337
Just for a little while.

31:16.282 --> 31:18.892
But I'll be back soon.
I promise.

31:20.677 --> 31:21.958
And you know what?

31:23.012 --> 31:23.872
What?

31:24.075 --> 31:25.637
Tonight's my last night.

31:25.786 --> 31:27.255
I'm not going back there again.

31:27.528 --> 31:28.427
Really?

31:28.630 --> 31:29.622
Ever!

31:31.956 --> 31:33.511
He's in go noogie wig!

31:33.598 --> 31:34.879
<i>There's uh, five of them.</i>

31:35.214 --> 31:39.013
Lee Barlow, Matthew Osmen, Lawrence
Colbert, Barry Sutton, Herbert Rauschen.

31:39.052 --> 31:41.849
Great. Um, can we reach them?

31:42.631 --> 31:43.771
Wait.

31:44.443 --> 31:47.545
Lee Barlow stabbed
himself six years ago.

31:48.029 --> 31:50.161
28 times to be precise

31:50.295 --> 31:51.568
in front of his family.

31:52.739 --> 31:55.533
Matthew Osmen, a strange
degenerative disease

31:55.682 --> 31:58.838
that rots the tissue until the
victim collapses to death.

31:58.932 --> 32:00.822
Doctors still don't understand.

32:01.737 --> 32:04.814
Barry Sutton was found
dead on a Portland dock.

32:04.924 --> 32:08.965
He had been devoured from the
inside by an unidentified insect.

32:09.909 --> 32:11.667
The interesting detail is

32:11.705 --> 32:15.150
they found a verse by Baudelaire
scratched onto his body by a knife.

32:16.362 --> 32:18.463
Lawrence Colbert went mad.

32:18.502 --> 32:19.791
He stabbed several children

32:19.831 --> 32:21.510
who were on their way
home at the school gates.

32:21.682 --> 32:23.096
The police shot him down.

32:23.197 --> 32:24.510
And you know what?

32:25.456 --> 32:28.307
They also found verses
tattooed on his back.

32:29.331 --> 32:32.620
So, it looks like we
have no witnesses left.

32:33.132 --> 32:34.132
That's it.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.429
No, no, no, no, wait.
You said there...

32:36.523 --> 32:38.172
What about Herbert Rauschen?

32:38.530 --> 32:40.172
Berkeley doesn't have
any records of him.

32:40.312 --> 32:41.992
In fact, they didn't
even recognize his name.

32:53.332 --> 32:54.496
Do what you're told.

32:56.114 --> 32:58.309
Hey, Rachel,
what a nice surprise.

33:04.168 --> 33:05.637
I heard you were late.

33:06.488 --> 33:07.371
Again.

33:07.683 --> 33:10.709
I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling too great.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.263
Ah. That's a shame.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.404
Neither am I.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.186
Would you look at this.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.709
Look at this, this crap
I have to take. Hmm?

33:19.730 --> 33:20.598
Yeah.

33:24.926 --> 33:26.488
But I'm never late, am I?

33:27.222 --> 33:28.043
No.

33:32.254 --> 33:34.941
You said that when
I got to 100 grand

33:34.996 --> 33:36.754
you'd give it back to me.

33:43.170 --> 33:44.491
That's the last of it.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.389
And what am I gonna tell the people
that brought you here, Rachel, huh?

33:57.850 --> 33:59.155
You don't know them.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.116
They're...

34:02.350 --> 34:03.561
They're bad news.

34:04.288 --> 34:05.116
Hmm?

34:05.850 --> 34:06.655
Hmm?

34:16.733 --> 34:18.186
You wanna leave us?

34:18.358 --> 34:20.748
You? Queen of the whores?

34:21.202 --> 34:23.350
After all we've been
through together.

34:26.030 --> 34:27.569
Don't we take good care of you?

34:27.663 --> 34:28.577
You do.

34:28.748 --> 34:29.858
We treat you well?

34:29.905 --> 34:31.350
-You do.
-Hmm?

34:35.313 --> 34:38.282
Don't be late again, Rachel.

34:39.525 --> 34:40.494
Ever.

34:42.563 --> 34:43.469
No, no, no, no.

34:43.626 --> 34:47.047
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

34:48.063 --> 34:49.376
And you're mistaken.

34:49.509 --> 34:51.634
It's 150 grand you owe me.

34:51.735 --> 34:53.150
That's the deal.

35:00.206 --> 35:01.730
Have you found anything?

35:03.355 --> 35:04.409
There.

35:07.346 --> 35:08.775
That's no surprise.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.042
Dunquin.

35:13.464 --> 35:14.917
That's here, right?

35:15.331 --> 35:18.401
There's a Dunquin in
County Kerry.

35:19.081 --> 35:21.987
Can you still access the
Irish university's database?

35:22.058 --> 35:24.034
He's dead, Samuel.
They all are.

35:24.105 --> 35:25.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but see for yourself.

35:26.105 --> 35:27.730
They never found a body.

35:27.815 --> 35:30.627
We need to look to see if he had
any link with the university here.

35:30.698 --> 35:33.729
Doctorates, conferences,
PhDs, anything.

35:33.783 --> 35:36.134
We need to see if we can get
a location on him, uh...

35:36.206 --> 35:38.049
find an address
for him living here.

35:39.394 --> 35:40.909
You better wait after me.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.511
I love you.

36:07.742 --> 36:09.180
Dino, come get it!

36:10.516 --> 36:11.499
Come get it.

36:18.086 --> 36:19.070
Dino?

36:20.578 --> 36:21.546
Dino?

36:28.563 --> 36:29.829
Dino?

36:30.856 --> 36:31.754
Dino?

36:35.990 --> 36:37.881
How the fuck did you
get into my home?

36:39.795 --> 36:41.319
Through the drain pipe.

36:41.889 --> 36:43.826
I can do incredible things.

36:44.998 --> 36:47.772
You better get out
before I call the police.

36:49.861 --> 36:51.955
We want the imago.

36:52.291 --> 36:54.619
What you found in the aquarium.

36:54.955 --> 36:56.947
It belongs to us.

36:57.963 --> 36:59.580
Who the hell are you?

36:59.741 --> 37:02.312
You took it out of the water.

37:02.585 --> 37:05.405
You have to be the one
who gives it back.

37:06.444 --> 37:09.827
Those are the rules.

37:10.632 --> 37:11.906
Get out.

37:16.423 --> 37:17.369
What the fuck have
you done with--

37:17.431 --> 37:18.775
I'll touch

37:19.238 --> 37:21.222
to where possible

37:21.729 --> 37:24.143
after a long grief

37:24.426 --> 37:26.762
and pain.

37:45.674 --> 37:47.221
Tomorrow

37:48.072 --> 37:49.947
before midnight

37:51.869 --> 37:55.221
25 miles along the
road to the north

37:55.427 --> 37:57.021
in Joy Hill

37:57.685 --> 37:59.084
come out

38:01.982 --> 38:03.873
with the imago.

39:33.988 --> 39:35.160
Samuel?

39:36.396 --> 39:37.818
-Sam?
-Shit.

39:39.505 --> 39:40.459
Sam?

39:44.685 --> 39:45.591
Samuel?

39:45.781 --> 39:47.547
-Open the door.
-All right, all right.

39:47.797 --> 39:49.859
-Just a sec. I'm coming!
-Sam?

39:52.594 --> 39:54.875
-What's your problem?
-Sorry, sorry.

39:55.430 --> 39:56.891
Are you okay?
Do you need help?

39:57.024 --> 39:59.227
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
gonna clean it up.

39:59.422 --> 40:00.469
Did you find anything?

40:00.594 --> 40:01.782
You know, you were right.

40:01.842 --> 40:05.217
In the mid 80s, Rauschen left his
chair at Brown to come to Europe.

40:05.289 --> 40:07.626
Did various rotations
at English universities

40:07.705 --> 40:09.502
and then he ended
up here in Cork.

40:09.772 --> 40:11.983
Well, have you got an address
from the file in Cork?

40:12.116 --> 40:14.124
No, they say he lived on campus.

40:14.163 --> 40:15.508
There was an address in Dunquin

40:15.555 --> 40:17.781
which he canceled
right before he quit.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.485
What does it sound like to you?

40:23.125 --> 40:25.453
Sounds to me like
someone who's hiding.

40:25.774 --> 40:27.391
Who's running scared.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.296
Have you got the address?

40:33.257 --> 40:34.890
-You better let me drive.
-No, no, no, no.

40:34.991 --> 40:36.749
-No, I'm going alone.
-What?

40:36.778 --> 40:38.317
-Susan...
-I thought we were in this together.

40:38.372 --> 40:39.341
Susan!

40:39.418 --> 40:41.496
Look at all this. Do you think
this is all a coincidence?

40:41.547 --> 40:44.562
People who get close
to this get hurt!

40:45.195 --> 40:47.524
-I mean it! It's over.
-Okay.

40:48.391 --> 40:50.180
You scare me right now.

40:50.250 --> 40:52.242
Just do as I say, okay?

41:36.848 --> 41:38.130
Good morning.

41:38.832 --> 41:41.973
My name's Samuel Salomon.
I'm from the university.

41:42.520 --> 41:43.911
And I was hoping to...

41:44.013 --> 41:46.372
speak with Professor Rauschen.

41:47.098 --> 41:48.746
The professor died.

41:50.277 --> 41:51.512
I know.

41:53.660 --> 41:56.137
Tell him it's about
the White Ring.

42:18.495 --> 42:19.682
Come in.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.027
My name is Samuel Salomon.

42:55.824 --> 42:57.347
I need to talk to you.

42:58.301 --> 42:59.886
About Lidia.

43:00.314 --> 43:01.697
Lidia Garetti.

43:03.704 --> 43:05.283
How did you find me?

43:11.253 --> 43:13.003
I found this photo

43:13.917 --> 43:15.542
from her house.

43:21.970 --> 43:23.525
Lidia is dead.

43:24.994 --> 43:26.791
She was murdered

43:26.884 --> 43:28.275
three days ago.

43:35.362 --> 43:37.105
What is it you want?

43:40.659 --> 43:42.503
I want you to tell me
what you know.

43:43.417 --> 43:44.815
About her.

43:45.300 --> 43:46.941
About the White Ring.

43:49.056 --> 43:50.806
The fake shipwreck.

43:51.939 --> 43:53.588
What are you hiding from?

44:00.020 --> 44:01.949
Seven ladies there are.

44:04.864 --> 44:07.682
That's what you came here
to talk about, isn't it?

44:10.809 --> 44:13.910
We spent years finding this.

44:14.544 --> 44:16.278
It was an obsession.

44:16.466 --> 44:17.544
What is that?

44:17.684 --> 44:19.894
Lidia recorded this moment.

44:20.617 --> 44:23.750
Just a little... demonstration.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.057
A demonstration of what?

44:33.620 --> 44:35.307
Of what they are.

44:37.362 --> 44:38.745
Wait a second.

44:40.918 --> 44:42.761
Are you suggesting that...

44:43.930 --> 44:47.055
-That Lidia...
-Yes, Mr. Salomon.

44:48.198 --> 44:50.245
She who foretells.

45:12.132 --> 45:13.882
<i>"Thus much and more</i>

45:15.429 --> 45:17.405
<i>"And yet thou lov'st me not</i>

45:18.445 --> 45:20.117
<i>"And never wilt</i>

45:21.365 --> 45:23.709
<i>"Love dwells not in our will</i>

45:25.544 --> 45:28.591
<i>"Nor can I blame thee,
though it be my lot</i>

45:30.131 --> 45:34.545
<i>"To strongly, wrongly,
vainly, love thee still"</i>

45:47.140 --> 45:48.609
What the fuck is that?

45:54.759 --> 45:56.408
It's what they do.

45:57.369 --> 46:00.283
Muses play with words.

46:00.400 --> 46:04.627
And they use poets to infiltrate
our world.

46:06.135 --> 46:07.933
The inspiration.

46:09.315 --> 46:13.823
These verses seem as beautiful
as any other, don't they?

46:14.761 --> 46:16.644
But they're traps.

46:19.980 --> 46:21.128
What is that?

46:21.237 --> 46:23.058
It looks harmless, doesn't it?

46:23.847 --> 46:25.424
But it kills

46:25.511 --> 46:27.417
everything I love.

46:29.761 --> 46:31.034
Friends.

46:32.276 --> 46:33.503
A child.

46:33.995 --> 46:35.901
And then another child.

46:36.347 --> 46:37.815
And then another.

46:40.050 --> 46:41.269
Everything.

46:42.667 --> 46:44.894
Lidia is not your problem.

46:45.932 --> 46:48.308
It's the other ones
you have to worry about.

46:50.692 --> 46:52.707
Give them what they want

46:52.918 --> 46:55.175
as soon as possible.
Do as I say.

46:55.567 --> 46:56.809
I can't.

46:58.668 --> 47:00.465
I don't have what they want.

47:01.372 --> 47:02.693
Then...

47:03.668 --> 47:04.894
Run.

47:51.379 --> 47:54.879
Mom, this one is the biggest,
hardest, and most massive object...

47:54.957 --> 47:56.371
Pack your things.

47:56.699 --> 47:58.656
-We have to go.
-Where?

47:58.754 --> 48:01.234
I don't know. We'll see.

48:01.306 --> 48:03.408
But why? This is our home.

48:04.619 --> 48:07.073
No, baby, it's not.
Please hurry.

48:21.488 --> 48:22.543
Excuse me.

48:22.839 --> 48:24.394
How you doing?

48:24.607 --> 48:26.154
-I um...
-Hey.

48:26.252 --> 48:27.291
We're closed.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.971
Yeah, hi, uh...

48:29.755 --> 48:31.709
I'm wondering if you can help me.
I'm looking for a girl.

48:31.748 --> 48:33.787
Get out.

48:33.957 --> 48:35.817
I don't want any trouble. I just
need to know where I can find...

48:35.855 --> 48:37.129
What's your problem?

48:59.193 --> 49:00.576
It's okay, it's okay.

49:00.647 --> 49:03.170
-Who the fuck are you?
-I'm just looking for a girl.

49:03.272 --> 49:04.545
I think she works here.

49:04.920 --> 49:08.288
Dark hair, green eyes,
Eastern European accent.

49:08.432 --> 49:10.487
Rachel, of course.

49:10.666 --> 49:11.721
Rachel?

49:11.830 --> 49:14.174
You think you're the first one
to come looking for her?

49:14.885 --> 49:17.229
I don't know how she makes you
all lose your fucking minds.

49:17.307 --> 49:19.127
No, no, no, no.
I've never been here before.

49:19.523 --> 49:21.640
I met her a couple of days ago.
We...

49:23.070 --> 49:25.671
Look, I really need to know
where to find her.

49:25.957 --> 49:27.331
I need to talk to her.

49:27.449 --> 49:29.051
Please, it's important.

49:31.191 --> 49:32.785
You're the guy with the dreams.

49:34.379 --> 49:35.379
Have...

49:36.152 --> 49:38.144
She told you about me?

49:39.207 --> 49:42.535
Look, she's in danger.
I just want to try and help her.

49:42.998 --> 49:44.295
Please.

49:47.780 --> 49:48.951
All right.

49:49.724 --> 49:53.044
She lives in one of the apartment
blocks in St. Teresa's Garden.

49:53.305 --> 49:56.391
I think it's the last one.
That's all I know.

49:57.015 --> 49:58.234
Thank you.

50:00.929 --> 50:02.929
-What are you doing?
-Packing.

50:03.140 --> 50:05.483
I meant your clothes,
put your clothes in.

50:05.538 --> 50:06.960
But I can't leave
my stuff here, Mom.

50:07.022 --> 50:08.467
I'll buy you other toys, I promise.

50:08.498 --> 50:09.631
But I don't want other toys.

50:09.686 --> 50:11.804
Just pick one.
Your favorite, yeah?

50:12.267 --> 50:13.400
This one?

50:13.525 --> 50:15.095
No, that's too big.

50:15.173 --> 50:16.477
This one, please?

50:16.532 --> 50:18.102
No, baby, that's even bigger.

50:38.387 --> 50:39.598
Put this on.

50:40.614 --> 50:41.856
You ready?

50:43.308 --> 50:44.245
Come on.

50:46.899 --> 50:47.750
Shh.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.208
Hello, Rachel.

51:03.866 --> 51:05.882
Have you forgotten who
got you this shithole?

51:06.038 --> 51:08.421
Go to the bedroom.
Now! Now! Go!

51:09.634 --> 51:11.243
Very obedient, isn't he?

51:11.946 --> 51:13.329
Didn't get that from you.

51:16.392 --> 51:17.704
What do you want?

51:17.954 --> 51:19.470
I was looking for your passport.

51:19.532 --> 51:22.298
I wanted to um, I wanted
to keep to my word.

51:22.937 --> 51:24.172
But you know what?

51:25.351 --> 51:26.609
I couldn't find it.

51:26.719 --> 51:28.812
Please don't hurt us,
don't hurt my son.

51:28.858 --> 51:31.812
Darling, what do you
take me for, huh?

51:32.007 --> 51:33.499
What do you take me for?

51:33.671 --> 51:35.608
Tonight, I-I come in peace.

51:35.768 --> 51:36.893
Tonight,

51:37.057 --> 51:38.659
you come by the club,

51:38.775 --> 51:41.283
we have a few drinks,
boogie woogie...

51:42.237 --> 51:43.612
It's all forgotten about.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.586
Yeah? Hmm?

51:46.976 --> 51:50.383
First, Rachel, you and I,
we're gonna have a

51:50.531 --> 51:52.219
we're gonna have a
little talk, yeah?

51:52.312 --> 51:54.288
So we can straighten things out.

51:57.595 --> 51:58.431
Please!

51:58.759 --> 52:00.329
Please, please, no!

52:06.437 --> 52:08.866
Fucking figure out how
things work around here.

52:09.054 --> 52:10.124
Hey, boys.

52:10.382 --> 52:11.991
I'm looking for a girl.

52:12.986 --> 52:15.205
She's got short dark hair,
she's very pretty.

52:16.112 --> 52:17.370
Are you a cop?

52:18.713 --> 52:19.752
Do you know her?

52:28.968 --> 52:30.359
You'll do as you're told, Rachel.

52:30.406 --> 52:32.702
You'll fuck whenever I tell ya

52:32.772 --> 52:34.241
or else your son's
gonna get hurt.

52:34.327 --> 52:36.007
And you don't want that, do ya?
Do ya?!

52:44.574 --> 52:45.925
You know now?

52:49.821 --> 52:51.352
You're giving me too
much trouble, Rachel.

52:51.422 --> 52:52.734
And I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand?

52:52.812 --> 52:53.914
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

52:53.976 --> 52:55.797
-I und...
-Get in there!

54:08.013 --> 54:09.193
Rachel?

54:10.186 --> 54:12.788
It's Samuel, the guy you
met at Garetti's house.

54:15.516 --> 54:16.930
Rachel?

54:22.399 --> 54:24.196
Rachel, I know you're in there.

54:30.216 --> 54:31.371
Mom?

54:39.833 --> 54:41.387
Rachel, I heard you.

54:42.053 --> 54:43.647
I know you're in there, Rachel.

54:53.592 --> 54:54.834
Rachel?

54:56.586 --> 54:58.071
He tried to kill us.

55:00.242 --> 55:01.336
What?

55:03.869 --> 55:05.228
Help us.

55:06.322 --> 55:07.689
Help us.

55:28.847 --> 55:30.254
Are you a policeman?

55:34.294 --> 55:35.201
No.

55:37.902 --> 55:39.910
You're not the first
person to ask me that.

55:43.266 --> 55:45.205
You think I look
like a policeman?

55:45.815 --> 55:47.279
Mmm, not really.

55:50.119 --> 55:52.172
Do you know what I want
to be when I grow up?

55:54.306 --> 55:55.514
No, what?

55:57.204 --> 55:58.688
A-An astronaut.

55:59.179 --> 56:01.714
Well, or an astronomer.

56:02.332 --> 56:03.866
To go to Jupiter...

56:04.369 --> 56:05.946
on an expedition.

56:06.897 --> 56:10.193
Did you know that they've never
sent anyone to explore it?

56:10.654 --> 56:12.813
Well, maybe they're
waiting to send you.

56:13.588 --> 56:15.264
So you can be the first.

56:17.292 --> 56:18.287
Come on, buddy.

56:18.525 --> 56:19.655
Time for bed.

56:39.858 --> 56:40.980
Is he asleep?

56:41.655 --> 56:42.635
Yeah.

56:50.369 --> 56:51.477
Thank you.

56:58.728 --> 57:00.980
-Listen, that man...
-I don't want to know.

57:02.421 --> 57:04.069
I don't know who
you are, Rachel.

57:04.439 --> 57:05.639
And it's fine.

57:07.017 --> 57:08.366
I just want this.

57:09.368 --> 57:10.412
And I've got it.

57:10.667 --> 57:12.045
But you helped us.

57:13.352 --> 57:15.312
You could've called the police.
You could've...

57:15.397 --> 57:17.983
taken that and just left but

57:18.629 --> 57:20.078
you brought us here.

57:22.678 --> 57:23.836
You're a good man.

57:26.762 --> 57:28.225
I'm a scared man.

57:30.413 --> 57:31.571
That's what I am.

57:35.077 --> 57:36.498
And a little sad.

57:46.601 --> 57:48.192
Why is that so important?

57:49.272 --> 57:51.182
All I know is that
there's someone

57:52.177 --> 57:54.287
willing to do anything
to get it back.

57:54.339 --> 57:55.532
The people who killed Lidia.

57:55.610 --> 57:56.910
Doesn't matter.

57:57.030 --> 57:59.416
That woman wanted us to find it.
I'm certain of it.

57:59.466 --> 58:01.540
She wanted us to find it, great.
We found it.

58:02.386 --> 58:04.012
And now I'm gonna give it back.

58:05.026 --> 58:06.247
End of story.

58:09.024 --> 58:10.168
And then what?

58:11.938 --> 58:14.102
I killed a man.

58:16.230 --> 58:17.707
They're gonna come after me.

58:18.425 --> 58:19.417
Then leave.

58:19.535 --> 58:20.606
I can't.

58:20.878 --> 58:23.208
I have nothing.
I have nowhere to go.

58:23.302 --> 58:24.794
You have your son.

58:25.987 --> 58:27.589
You can still change your life.

58:35.832 --> 58:37.254
What about you?

58:46.469 --> 58:47.540
It's time.

58:55.883 --> 58:57.719
You're not coming back.

58:59.102 --> 59:00.165
Are you?

59:03.138 --> 59:04.403
Stay here.

59:04.700 --> 59:06.849
And don't open the door
to anyone.

59:52.124 --> 59:55.100
-Hello?
<i>-Mr. Salomon, this is Rauschen.</i>

59:55.241 --> 59:56.702
There's something
I didn't tell you.

59:56.854 --> 01:00:00.104
Lidia sent me a letter
some months ago.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:03.518
I hadn't heard from her in
years, so I was scared.

01:00:03.572 --> 01:00:06.181
<i>I thought there would be
something evil in her words.</i>

01:00:06.206 --> 01:00:08.259
Uh, Professor, I appreciate
you calling me, but...

01:00:08.353 --> 01:00:09.502
You don't understand.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:13.486
I think Lidia knew
you were coming to see me.

01:00:13.867 --> 01:00:16.046
<i>I think the letter was for you.</i>

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:19.069
<i>Professor, listen, it's over...</i>

01:00:19.336 --> 01:00:21.226
Hello again, Professor.

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:22.450
Pro--

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:46.781
Mr. Salomon.

01:01:33.551 --> 01:01:35.402
Such a horrible day.

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:41.078
Welcome, Mr. Salomon.

01:01:42.563 --> 01:01:44.298
We were expecting you.

01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:46.508
Who are you?

01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:48.813
She who invokes.

01:01:50.532 --> 01:01:53.680
Some people call me Herberia
but it's a bit

01:01:53.899 --> 01:01:55.704
pretentious, don't you think?

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.109
You can call me Jaqueline.

01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:01.312
It's a French name.

01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:03.164
Do you like it?

01:02:04.289 --> 01:02:05.288
No.

01:02:07.273 --> 01:02:09.124
You're an insolent man.

01:02:09.711 --> 01:02:11.297
That does not befit a poet.

01:02:11.515 --> 01:02:12.554
I am not a poet.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:14.157
One who gave up writing.

01:02:14.766 --> 01:02:16.313
What a waste.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.384
If you only knew what
you were missing.

01:02:21.164 --> 01:02:23.133
There's a line by Cavafy

01:02:23.209 --> 01:02:26.467
that can produce
blisters filled with pus

01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:28.592
and a high fever.

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:33.661
And a very brief Neruda that
explodes like a nuclear plant.

01:02:34.174 --> 01:02:35.502
Boom!

01:02:36.009 --> 01:02:38.697
Poetry can do incredible things.

01:02:39.572 --> 01:02:41.736
I didn't come here
to see party tricks.

01:02:43.408 --> 01:02:44.924
No, of course not.

01:02:46.045 --> 01:02:48.701
We have matters to
deal with, do we not?

01:02:49.442 --> 01:02:51.223
First, you have to
give me your word.

01:02:51.474 --> 01:02:53.060
You will not harm us.

01:02:54.201 --> 01:02:55.927
You have your own conditions?

01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:59.577
You should stop drinking
whiskey, Mr. Salomon.

01:02:59.663 --> 01:03:02.530
The girl and the child. No one.

01:03:03.681 --> 01:03:05.376
If I give you what you want,

01:03:05.899 --> 01:03:07.908
you forget about us

01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:09.251
forever.

01:03:10.493 --> 01:03:12.032
I want to see it.

01:03:24.806 --> 01:03:28.345
Promise...
and I'll give it to you.

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:32.281
I promise.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.788
This is not the imago.

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:55.335
Just a shell.

01:03:56.546 --> 01:03:59.663
Did you by any chance come
here to trick us, Mr. Salomon?

01:04:01.259 --> 01:04:03.634
Well, someone did. It's obvious.

01:04:06.493 --> 01:04:09.134
It seems that girl of yours
is not to be trusted.

01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:41.023
Bring us the imago, Mr. Salomon.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.812
But do not expect mercy now.

01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:12.161
Samuel?

01:05:12.645 --> 01:05:14.443
Rachel, open the door.

01:05:16.544 --> 01:05:17.544
Who is it?

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.341
You know who I am.

01:05:19.466 --> 01:05:21.966
Please open the door,
they can't see me here.

01:05:29.107 --> 01:05:30.224
Lidia.

01:05:33.294 --> 01:05:34.997
You started to remember.

01:05:38.357 --> 01:05:39.466
No, but...

01:05:41.122 --> 01:05:43.810
No, that's impossible.
I saw you die.

01:05:46.497 --> 01:05:48.044
They had to believe that.

01:05:49.013 --> 01:05:49.864
Why?

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:52.083
You still don't remember,
but you will.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:55.654
My baby?

01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:57.450
No. No.

01:05:57.591 --> 01:05:59.552
No, it wasn't
because of your baby.

01:06:00.528 --> 01:06:02.810
That was an excuse.
It was because of you.

01:06:03.935 --> 01:06:05.786
You-You're different.

01:06:06.489 --> 01:06:08.927
You've always been different.
You can feel things.

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:11.935
They'll never
be able to feel.

01:06:12.284 --> 01:06:14.042
That's why they envy you.

01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:17.581
What about you?

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:20.221
I'm with you.

01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:22.714
We have a plan.

01:06:24.784 --> 01:06:26.159
That's why I'm here.

01:06:28.409 --> 01:06:30.010
Do you want to remember?

01:06:30.831 --> 01:06:34.057
We're so lucky that
insignificant man came along.

01:06:34.682 --> 01:06:36.010
Samuel.

01:06:37.469 --> 01:06:39.196
Jaqueline's puzzled.

01:06:39.384 --> 01:06:41.821
Doesn't understand what
he has to do with any of it.

01:06:45.594 --> 01:06:47.204
You called him.

01:06:47.674 --> 01:06:51.299
With the dreams,
like you called... me.

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.978
Yes. Right.

01:06:57.658 --> 01:06:59.549
How forgetful of me.

01:07:04.924 --> 01:07:06.314
Who are you?

01:07:21.107 --> 01:07:22.513
Gotcha.

01:07:24.591 --> 01:07:26.365
Don't you remember me?

01:07:27.154 --> 01:07:28.771
She who lies.

01:07:30.451 --> 01:07:32.591
You can tell
I'm out of practice.

01:07:33.942 --> 01:07:35.122
What do you want?

01:07:35.232 --> 01:07:36.966
You know exactly what I want.

01:07:37.529 --> 01:07:39.130
You can't have it.

01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:42.802
You can't take it from me.
I remember the rules.

01:07:42.857 --> 01:07:46.154
Of course. The rules.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.771
The ones you don't follow.

01:07:50.779 --> 01:07:52.662
But that's not why I'm here.

01:07:54.786 --> 01:07:56.005
Mom?

01:07:56.286 --> 01:07:57.794
Go back to bed, buddy.

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.881
Six. Where's the six?

01:09:03.162 --> 01:09:06.171
She...who punishes.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.617
I've been expecting you
for a long time.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.868
Secrets must be kept, Professor.

01:09:19.017 --> 01:09:21.055
You should have
learned that by now.

01:09:23.665 --> 01:09:25.751
Don't exert yourself.

01:09:28.493 --> 01:09:30.024
That's Yates.

01:09:30.408 --> 01:09:32.001
It won't let you move.

01:09:39.491 --> 01:09:41.537
Don't be afraid.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:45.319
This one is very short.

01:09:46.679 --> 01:09:50.194
But it's going to keep
you alive for hours.

01:09:52.912 --> 01:09:55.663
We didn't want you to
miss out on anything.

01:10:19.945 --> 01:10:21.430
What the fuck?

01:10:29.164 --> 01:10:30.336
Six.

01:10:46.126 --> 01:10:47.415
What did you do?

01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:50.523
What the fuck did you do?

01:10:51.759 --> 01:10:53.180
They took my son.

01:10:54.592 --> 01:10:55.803
What?

01:11:07.294 --> 01:11:09.145
I just wanted that thing.

01:11:09.411 --> 01:11:12.348
-Why didn't you give it to me?
-Couldn't.

01:11:13.966 --> 01:11:15.387
I remembered.

01:11:15.942 --> 01:11:18.208
What are you talking about?
Remembered what?

01:11:21.723 --> 01:11:23.043
What I am.

01:11:28.434 --> 01:11:29.825
My imago.

01:11:31.177 --> 01:11:32.762
Every lady has one.

01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:35.223
It's our power.

01:11:35.637 --> 01:11:39.208
Our memory.
This is eternity.

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:43.746
Without it, we're just
pieces of flesh.

01:11:44.075 --> 01:11:45.403
I've seen them.

01:11:46.067 --> 01:11:47.340
And you're not like that.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.035
That's why they hate me.

01:11:50.129 --> 01:11:51.981
They hate everything
that seems human

01:11:52.136 --> 01:11:54.167
because they'll never
be able to have it.

01:11:56.491 --> 01:11:57.866
But I can love.

01:11:59.147 --> 01:12:01.504
They've been looking for a chance
to banish me for centuries--

01:12:01.558 --> 01:12:03.038
any excuse.

01:12:04.092 --> 01:12:05.428
Then it happened.

01:12:06.827 --> 01:12:10.569
There are rules.
There are hundreds of rules.

01:12:11.006 --> 01:12:13.553
A lady cannot bear children.
It's forbidden.

01:12:14.256 --> 01:12:15.952
That gave them a reason.

01:12:19.154 --> 01:12:20.585
They could have
just destroyed it

01:12:20.678 --> 01:12:23.107
and let me to die like
any human, but no.

01:12:23.186 --> 01:12:24.420
They wanted more.

01:12:24.467 --> 01:12:26.264
They buried it
and they voided it.

01:12:26.444 --> 01:12:29.405
I lost my power.
I forgot everything.

01:12:29.538 --> 01:12:31.577
And then they
sold me to that man.

01:12:32.686 --> 01:12:35.006
But my eternity would
remain intact.

01:12:36.788 --> 01:12:38.960
So the punishment
would never end.

01:12:40.764 --> 01:12:42.366
<i>Then Lidia got it back.</i>

01:12:43.374 --> 01:12:46.592
<i>She was different too,
in her own way.</i>

01:12:47.338 --> 01:12:49.018
<i>She always wanted to help me.</i>

01:12:49.747 --> 01:12:52.881
<i>They must've found out somehow
and that's why they killed her.</i>

01:12:54.685 --> 01:12:55.943
That can't be.

01:12:56.107 --> 01:12:57.334
There is a way.

01:12:57.693 --> 01:12:59.060
A ritual.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.810
The White Ring.

01:13:05.857 --> 01:13:07.568
Lidia could see the future.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:10.537
She's been guiding us
from the beginning.

01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:13.154
But why me?

01:13:13.271 --> 01:13:15.217
Maybe she thought
I needed help.

01:13:20.684 --> 01:13:22.512
She would never have chosen me.

01:13:29.497 --> 01:13:31.442
I would have chosen you.

01:13:34.809 --> 01:13:36.145
"Nor want

01:13:36.974 --> 01:13:38.419
"Nor weakness

01:13:38.974 --> 01:13:40.770
"Still conspires

01:13:41.919 --> 01:13:43.208
"To bind us

01:13:43.802 --> 01:13:45.419
"To a sordid state"

01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:53.726
What are you?

01:13:55.226 --> 01:13:57.054
She who impassions.

01:14:04.851 --> 01:14:06.203
Give it to them.

01:14:06.304 --> 01:14:07.289
No.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.742
They've won.

01:14:09.936 --> 01:14:11.976
They'll do the same
thing to you again.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.351
And they'll kill me,
I'm sure of it.

01:14:16.358 --> 01:14:19.405
As long as we have the imago,
they'll keep me alive.

01:14:20.945 --> 01:14:22.820
I took it, I have to give it back.

01:14:23.132 --> 01:14:24.906
Those are the rules.

01:14:25.624 --> 01:14:28.249
This is the only thing
that's protecting us.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.070
What?

01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:37.296
Number Seven.

01:14:40.147 --> 01:14:41.975
She who hides.

01:14:44.617 --> 01:14:46.703
Not even we have seen her.

01:14:47.412 --> 01:14:49.873
She's the cruelest,
the most dangerous.

01:14:50.358 --> 01:14:51.960
But she's also the weakest.

01:14:52.951 --> 01:14:54.702
If she dies, they all die.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:56.772
That's why she hides.

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:58.413
Where?

01:14:58.835 --> 01:15:00.076
The receptacle.

01:15:01.639 --> 01:15:03.186
Nobody knows what it is.

01:15:05.319 --> 01:15:06.342
Wait.

01:15:06.779 --> 01:15:07.944
Lidia.

01:15:08.483 --> 01:15:09.850
Maybe she knew.

01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:14.264
No, if she wanted to help us,
she would have told us somehow.

01:15:18.233 --> 01:15:19.538
Maybe she did.

01:15:21.232 --> 01:15:22.350
<i>Makes sense.</i>

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.264
Lidia knew they
were watching her.

01:15:24.439 --> 01:15:25.907
That's why she was
being so cryptic.

01:15:26.001 --> 01:15:27.743
That's why she sent the
letter to Rauschen.

01:15:27.806 --> 01:15:29.353
And hid the photo in the frame.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.526
She knew it would
lead you to him.

01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:53.654
You better stay here.

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:18.838
Professor?

01:16:24.683 --> 01:16:25.870
Hello?

01:16:33.331 --> 01:16:34.691
Professor?

01:16:59.183 --> 01:17:00.230
Professor?

01:17:16.992 --> 01:17:17.984
Professor?

01:17:23.152 --> 01:17:24.464
Professor, is that you?

01:17:32.285 --> 01:17:34.402
Professor, the letter.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.784
Where is it?

01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:42.870
Professor?

01:18:35.368 --> 01:18:37.955
Now, listen, listen to me now...

01:19:02.275 --> 01:19:03.892
"My heart aches,

01:19:04.361 --> 01:19:06.724
"and a drowsy numbness pains"

01:19:17.218 --> 01:19:18.913
Do you think they know
about the letter?

01:19:18.999 --> 01:19:20.796
No, they they would
have taken it.

01:19:24.187 --> 01:19:25.249
A key?

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.171
"They are all gone into
the world of light

01:19:30.429 --> 01:19:32.788
"And I alone sit ling’ring here

01:19:33.288 --> 01:19:35.733
"Their very memory
is fair and bright,

01:19:35.866 --> 01:19:38.154
"And my sad thoughts
doth clear."

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.123
My sad thoughts doth clear.

01:19:40.506 --> 01:19:42.553
My sad thoughts doth clear.

01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:48.983
It's Milton. I'm sure of it.

01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:51.608
-It has to mean something.
-I don't know.

01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:57.381
But I know someone who will.

01:20:19.553 --> 01:20:20.506
It's open.

01:20:21.725 --> 01:20:22.858
Oh, fuck.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.100
Susan?

01:20:30.678 --> 01:20:31.764
Susan?

01:20:41.947 --> 01:20:42.947
Oh, my God!

01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:44.853
Susan, stop that!

01:20:45.502 --> 01:20:46.494
Oh, fuck.

01:20:46.634 --> 01:20:48.353
Fucking hell, what
have they done to you?

01:20:48.518 --> 01:20:49.876
When did they do this to you?

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:51.705
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.868
Dammit! Stop it!

01:20:54.119 --> 01:20:55.080
Stop it!

01:20:58.291 --> 01:20:59.181
Stop!

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:07.908
What does it mean?

01:21:08.056 --> 01:21:09.681
She's gonna devour herself.

01:21:09.963 --> 01:21:11.829
Well, there must be some
way we can stop it!

01:21:11.892 --> 01:21:13.111
There's nothing we can do.

01:21:13.181 --> 01:21:14.728
You stopped the nurse,
maybe you can do it.

01:21:14.775 --> 01:21:16.299
I didn't stop the nurse.
I killed him.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.995
Do you want me to do that now?

01:21:18.182 --> 01:21:19.823
Maybe we can cut it out!

01:21:20.018 --> 01:21:21.463
-What?
-Go get a knife!

01:21:21.557 --> 01:21:22.534
I don't think that'll work.

01:21:22.573 --> 01:21:24.394
Down to the kitchen at
the end of the hallway.

01:21:24.573 --> 01:21:26.183
Bring whatever you can find.

01:21:27.305 --> 01:21:28.172
No!

01:21:29.164 --> 01:21:31.305
Susan, please, stop it!
Stop it!

01:21:45.477 --> 01:21:47.594
Rachel! Hurry, please!

01:21:51.993 --> 01:21:53.118
Rachel!

01:21:53.688 --> 01:21:54.782
I can't.

01:21:54.969 --> 01:21:56.227
Help me put her on her back.

01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:57.961
Hold her hand,
don't let her touch it.

01:21:58.743 --> 01:22:00.540
Take her hands, hold her hands.

01:22:02.321 --> 01:22:03.672
Are you sure about this?

01:22:11.711 --> 01:22:12.618
No!

01:22:12.758 --> 01:22:14.023
We're gonna have to
tie her down.

01:22:14.118 --> 01:22:15.937
Stop her hurting herself.
Find us something to tie...

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.062
Tie her up.

01:22:17.148 --> 01:22:18.156
I'm not gonna hurt you,

01:22:18.235 --> 01:22:20.641
but I'm gonna have to stop you
from doing this to yourself, all right?

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:22.047
I'm so sorry...

01:22:22.102 --> 01:22:23.250
I got it, I got it!

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:24.438
All right.

01:22:24.993 --> 01:22:26.844
-Turn her round.
-Give me her hand.

01:22:29.321 --> 01:22:30.430
All right, that's good.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.782
Get it, get it.

01:22:33.969 --> 01:22:36.321
We're gonna get you onto the
bed now, you'll be okay up there.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:37.954
All right, shh now...

01:22:38.102 --> 01:22:39.024
Here we go.

01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:41.113
Shh...shh...

01:22:41.292 --> 01:22:42.222
Okay.

01:22:42.613 --> 01:22:43.574
All right.

01:22:44.699 --> 01:22:46.331
Shh, shh, shh...

01:22:49.019 --> 01:22:50.183
Try to breathe.

01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:53.730
Breathe...

01:22:55.035 --> 01:22:56.285
Breathe.

01:23:02.808 --> 01:23:04.206
We have to call an ambulance.

01:23:04.949 --> 01:23:07.191
They'll take her to a hospital.
They'll try to remove it.

01:23:07.277 --> 01:23:09.808
They won't.
They don't know what it is.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.440
As soon as she's free,
she'll start doing it again

01:23:12.558 --> 01:23:14.104
and she won't stop. I'm sorry.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.660
What if they keep her safe?

01:23:16.105 --> 01:23:17.792
What if they sedate
her or something?

01:23:19.183 --> 01:23:21.144
She can still help us.

01:23:21.777 --> 01:23:23.628
You have to show her the verse.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.058
They have my son.

01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:31.347
You have no idea what
they're capable of. Please.

01:23:36.097 --> 01:23:37.425
Call an ambulance.

01:23:41.956 --> 01:23:42.917
Susan...

01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:50.363
I'm-I'm sorry to have to ask you
this, but I need your help.

01:23:50.738 --> 01:23:52.675
I need you to tell me
what this means.

01:23:54.292 --> 01:23:56.136
"They are all gone into
the world of light

01:23:56.191 --> 01:23:58.363
"And I alone sit ling’ring here

01:23:58.878 --> 01:24:00.847
"Their very memory
is fair and bright,

01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:03.230
"And my sad thoughts
doth clear."

01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:04.805
It's Milton, isn't it?

01:24:05.187 --> 01:24:07.437
-You're the expert, you tell me...
-No.

01:24:07.641 --> 01:24:08.540
No.

01:24:09.915 --> 01:24:11.337
Not Milton.

01:24:11.477 --> 01:24:12.493
What?

01:24:13.704 --> 01:24:14.813
Vaughan.

01:24:16.984 --> 01:24:18.656
People mistake that...

01:24:19.374 --> 01:24:20.944
The poem, Susan,
what does it mean?

01:24:21.046 --> 01:24:22.406
-What does it...?
-Let me go.

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:24.562
-Let me go.
-Susan, please.

01:24:26.695 --> 01:24:27.851
-I'm sorry.
-Let me go.

01:24:28.117 --> 01:24:29.742
-Let me go.
-I'm sorry.

01:24:30.187 --> 01:24:32.054
The poem, what does it mean?

01:24:34.593 --> 01:24:36.218
Beyond the veil.

01:24:38.242 --> 01:24:39.242
Susan?

01:24:43.882 --> 01:24:46.187
They won't be long.
What'd she tell you?

01:24:46.765 --> 01:24:47.741
Nothing.

01:24:48.671 --> 01:24:50.585
Beyond the veil, is the
title of the poem?

01:24:52.645 --> 01:24:54.497
Why didn't she just
write down an address?

01:24:55.637 --> 01:24:57.239
If she wanted to tell us.

01:25:02.903 --> 01:25:05.387
Wait, beyond the veil.

01:25:10.075 --> 01:25:11.379
She did.

01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:16.700
Bortrane Lunatic Asylum.

01:25:17.222 --> 01:25:18.730
Room 1007.

01:25:19.043 --> 01:25:20.278
This is the place.

01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:23.379
It's indelible ink.

01:25:23.972 --> 01:25:26.941
Lidia sent the letter from
there six months ago.

01:25:27.785 --> 01:25:29.809
But it's been closed for years.

01:25:30.019 --> 01:25:31.640
We have to go. Now.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.453
No, no, no. We have to
wait for the ambulance.

01:25:34.234 --> 01:25:35.976
We can't leave Susan like this.

01:25:36.617 --> 01:25:37.937
She's my friend.

01:25:39.945 --> 01:25:41.609
Then I'll wait outside.

01:25:49.843 --> 01:25:51.679
There's an ambulance
on it's way.

01:25:52.546 --> 01:25:54.007
They'll be here any minute.

01:25:56.527 --> 01:25:58.386
Do you hear me, Susan?

01:26:00.182 --> 01:26:01.987
Everything will be
just as before.

01:26:02.573 --> 01:26:03.752
I promise.

01:26:04.291 --> 01:26:07.151
I'll come back to the
university like you wanted.

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:20.174
I think I can help her.

01:26:21.088 --> 01:26:22.440
I'm remembering.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:25.604
How?

01:26:27.018 --> 01:26:28.588
I'm not sure but I can try.

01:26:32.385 --> 01:26:33.948
Leave me alone with her.

01:26:34.869 --> 01:26:36.025
Okay.

01:27:13.994 --> 01:27:15.072
Susan!

01:27:20.142 --> 01:27:21.416
Got you.

01:27:22.994 --> 01:27:26.009
I wouldn't go in there if
I were you, Mr. Salomon.

01:27:28.408 --> 01:27:29.908
You won't like it.

01:27:37.064 --> 01:27:38.760
No!

01:28:25.559 --> 01:28:27.160
I want to hurt them.

01:28:30.176 --> 01:28:32.075
I want them to fucking die.

01:28:40.059 --> 01:28:41.418
The receptacle.

01:28:43.434 --> 01:28:45.762
Whatever it is,
it has to be in there.

01:28:46.106 --> 01:28:47.473
That's where she's hiding.

01:28:54.778 --> 01:28:56.137
We'll have to be ready.

01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:01.603
What happens when she dies?

01:29:05.439 --> 01:29:06.564
They all will.

01:29:10.822 --> 01:29:11.822
And you?

01:29:18.837 --> 01:29:20.282
My son will live.

01:30:07.827 --> 01:30:09.046
We have to hurry.

01:30:09.561 --> 01:30:11.374
Won't take them long to find us.

01:30:11.835 --> 01:30:13.460
Room 1007.

01:30:35.601 --> 01:30:36.663
1000.

01:30:40.454 --> 01:30:41.688
1006.

01:30:42.805 --> 01:30:43.922
-Seven.
-Seven.

01:30:44.313 --> 01:30:45.375
Stand back here.

01:30:52.332 --> 01:30:53.715
There's nothing in here.

01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:55.848
It has to be.

01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.716
The message is clear.

01:30:57.856 --> 01:30:59.646
-What if you're wrong?
-No.

01:31:00.317 --> 01:31:01.669
No, no, no, no.

01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:15.153
Promise.

01:31:15.771 --> 01:31:16.708
Will.

01:31:18.224 --> 01:31:19.380
Love.

01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:24.638
Forever.

01:31:25.174 --> 01:31:27.150
Promise you'll love forever.

01:31:29.014 --> 01:31:30.186
What's wrong?

01:31:45.819 --> 01:31:46.975
What is that?

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.334
It's you.

01:31:53.256 --> 01:31:54.357
What is it?

01:31:56.249 --> 01:31:57.381
The receptacle.

01:31:57.975 --> 01:31:59.194
It's you.

01:31:59.641 --> 01:32:00.538
What?

01:32:00.821 --> 01:32:01.797
She's...

01:32:02.345 --> 01:32:04.290
She's inside you.

01:32:06.925 --> 01:32:08.026
Lidia knew it.

01:32:08.253 --> 01:32:10.644
You were the only piece
out of place.

01:32:11.089 --> 01:32:12.542
Now everything fits.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:13.901
No.

01:32:14.089 --> 01:32:15.245
-Samuel.
-No.

01:32:15.347 --> 01:32:16.308
Samuel?

01:32:17.081 --> 01:32:18.620
Face it, Samuel. Tell me.

01:32:18.808 --> 01:32:20.972
Think about how you met her.

01:32:21.128 --> 01:32:23.550
How she appeared in your life.
It was all part of a plan.

01:32:23.667 --> 01:32:24.450
Stop!

01:32:24.529 --> 01:32:26.403
She made you fall in love
with here, didn't she?

01:32:26.529 --> 01:32:27.646
And then she left.

01:32:31.693 --> 01:32:32.521
Why?

01:32:32.599 --> 01:32:35.333
Because she knew...you'll
never be able to forget her.

01:32:35.942 --> 01:32:37.380
You were the perfect
hiding place.

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:38.372
No!

01:32:39.084 --> 01:32:39.943
No!

01:32:40.092 --> 01:32:42.356
She's inside you, Samuel.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.216
She's in your heart.

01:32:52.593 --> 01:32:55.015
I want to get her
out of my heart!

01:32:56.085 --> 01:32:57.702
I know how to do that.

01:32:59.116 --> 01:33:01.054
But you have to tell me
how it happened.

01:33:12.906 --> 01:33:15.015
You have chosen well, Rachel.

01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:21.101
The saddest of all stages
for the saddest of all endings.

01:33:23.828 --> 01:33:25.101
What is this place?

01:33:27.547 --> 01:33:28.758
It's here.

01:33:30.101 --> 01:33:31.523
It has to happen here.

01:33:39.844 --> 01:33:40.961
What is it?

01:33:41.383 --> 01:33:42.375
Lidia.

01:33:43.695 --> 01:33:45.132
What are you looking for?

01:33:45.765 --> 01:33:46.929
It's perfect.

01:33:48.117 --> 01:33:49.359
What are you doing?

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.922
Help me.

01:33:54.641 --> 01:33:55.813
Tear this off.

01:34:05.313 --> 01:34:06.539
The White Ring.

01:34:08.172 --> 01:34:09.274
Come on.

01:34:09.617 --> 01:34:11.000
I'm gonna need you now.

01:34:11.219 --> 01:34:12.375
Follow me.

01:34:18.617 --> 01:34:20.258
What do you need me to do?

01:34:20.539 --> 01:34:22.828
We'll trick her.
We have to smoke her out.

01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:23.984
Yes.

01:34:24.227 --> 01:34:25.485
Take off your coat.

01:34:27.391 --> 01:34:30.571
If the receptacle is in danger...
If your body is hurt...

01:34:30.617 --> 01:34:32.149
she'll be forced to come out.

01:34:32.549 --> 01:34:33.745
Give me your arm.

01:34:37.768 --> 01:34:38.862
We'll have to be quick.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.158
When she comes out, she'll
sense that she's in danger

01:34:41.274 --> 01:34:42.595
and she'll turn violent.

01:34:42.807 --> 01:34:44.284
We have to put her in the circle.

01:34:44.409 --> 01:34:46.135
That will immobilize her.

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.065
And that will be the moment.

01:34:49.088 --> 01:34:50.260
Samuel,

01:34:51.205 --> 01:34:52.635
you’re gonna have to kill her.

01:34:53.503 --> 01:34:54.956
There's no other way.

01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:58.854
Oh, fuck.

01:35:06.808 --> 01:35:08.449
I don't want you to die.

01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:15.738
Promise me.

01:35:17.004 --> 01:35:18.590
You'll take care of my son.

01:35:20.464 --> 01:35:21.597
Always.

01:35:23.237 --> 01:35:24.675
Promise me you'll love him.

01:35:26.995 --> 01:35:28.065
Please.

01:36:21.551 --> 01:36:22.754
She's running.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:28.995
She's coming.

01:36:32.949 --> 01:36:34.113
She's coming.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.556
Samuel.

01:37:43.681 --> 01:37:44.868
You have to hang on.

01:37:45.353 --> 01:37:46.329
Please.

01:37:46.481 --> 01:37:48.256
Please, please please.
Hang on, please.

01:38:00.481 --> 01:38:01.653
I have no wit,

01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:03.575
I have no words,

01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:06.145
I have no tears,

01:38:07.152 --> 01:38:08.269
No tears.

01:38:20.801 --> 01:38:22.130
Bring the boy.

01:38:49.163 --> 01:38:50.272
Samuel?

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.295
Don't listen to her.

01:38:52.585 --> 01:38:53.694
Kill her.

01:38:53.873 --> 01:38:55.624
She's lying to you, Samuel.

01:38:55.983 --> 01:38:57.682
She has no idea what we were.

01:38:57.870 --> 01:39:00.198
Don't listen to her.
Kill her.

01:39:00.448 --> 01:39:02.027
Look at me, Samuel.

01:39:02.847 --> 01:39:05.699
It's me, Samuel.
Don't you remember?

01:39:05.926 --> 01:39:07.152
Kill her.

01:39:07.262 --> 01:39:08.816
No, don't do it, no!

01:39:08.886 --> 01:39:09.918
Kill her.

01:39:10.097 --> 01:39:11.636
No, don't listen to her, please.

01:39:11.777 --> 01:39:12.644
Do it!

01:39:12.715 --> 01:39:13.636
My love.

01:39:13.754 --> 01:39:14.785
You're not Beatriz.

01:39:14.879 --> 01:39:16.917
-No, don't say that.
-You are not Beatriz.

01:39:16.979 --> 01:39:19.222
She was alive.

01:39:19.293 --> 01:39:20.988
And my love, it's not that simple.

01:39:21.447 --> 01:39:23.260
I'm a lot of things
at the same time.

01:39:23.472 --> 01:39:24.316
No.

01:39:24.505 --> 01:39:26.583
No, no, no, no, no.
She's lying to you.

01:39:26.724 --> 01:39:28.200
She's lying to you.
Kill her.

01:39:28.318 --> 01:39:29.497
Look at me.

01:39:30.036 --> 01:39:31.723
I could have chosen anyone.

01:39:31.872 --> 01:39:32.888
She's lying.

01:39:33.028 --> 01:39:34.208
But I chose you.

01:39:35.638 --> 01:39:36.818
Do you know why?

01:39:36.911 --> 01:39:38.716
Do it. Do it. Kill her.

01:39:38.974 --> 01:39:40.372
Because I loved you.

01:39:40.466 --> 01:39:41.575
No, no, no, no no.

01:39:41.677 --> 01:39:42.739
-You know it.
-No. No.

01:39:43.254 --> 01:39:45.012
She's lying. Look at me.

01:39:45.122 --> 01:39:46.091
You promised.

01:39:46.232 --> 01:39:48.075
Do you remember,
you promised me?

01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:49.825
You will love me forever.

01:39:50.369 --> 01:39:51.291
What?

01:39:51.971 --> 01:39:53.228
-What?
-Kill her.

01:39:53.658 --> 01:39:54.854
Kill her!

01:40:11.119 --> 01:40:12.440
I must admit.

01:40:12.861 --> 01:40:15.346
I didn't think you'd
get this far, Rachel.

01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:20.135
Mom?

01:40:20.448 --> 01:40:21.604
Oh, babe...

01:40:24.233 --> 01:40:25.335
Please.

01:40:27.382 --> 01:40:28.437
Let him go.

01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:29.827
No, Rachel.

01:40:30.311 --> 01:40:32.077
The rules are different.

01:40:33.163 --> 01:40:34.530
You let her go

01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:37.749
and your son will
live a little longer.

01:40:40.476 --> 01:40:42.593
We've come for the
imago, remember?

01:40:44.335 --> 01:40:46.897
He will never give it to you.

01:40:48.788 --> 01:40:51.054
I don't think he'll
have much choice.

01:40:55.437 --> 01:40:58.038
The end of this story
has already been written.

01:40:59.382 --> 01:41:01.022
Give us the imago

01:41:01.225 --> 01:41:03.014
and we can turn the page.

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:06.530
Mom!

01:41:06.882 --> 01:41:07.874
Mom!

01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:12.341
Accept your fate, Rachel.

01:41:13.054 --> 01:41:16.593
I have incredible plans for you.

01:41:16.733 --> 01:41:18.968
Samuel, don't do it.

01:41:21.422 --> 01:41:22.702
Shhh...

01:41:31.742 --> 01:41:32.883
You see?

01:41:33.718 --> 01:41:35.350
You can't do it.

01:41:36.699 --> 01:41:39.066
You won't want to leave your son

01:41:39.472 --> 01:41:40.902
alone

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:43.355
in this mediocre world.

01:41:45.473 --> 01:41:48.598
That wouldn't be a good end
for this story, would it?

01:42:01.019 --> 01:42:04.496
I can't think...of a better one.

01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:07.992
Kill her.

01:42:11.398 --> 01:42:12.586
Now.

01:42:33.437 --> 01:42:35.648
<i>This is how that story ends.</i>

01:42:37.008 --> 01:42:38.906
<i>The saddest story of them all.</i>

01:42:40.531 --> 01:42:42.101
<i>And like all stories,</i>

01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:43.914
<i>one day,</i>

01:42:44.101 --> 01:42:45.570
<i>it will be forgotten.</i>

01:42:48.488 --> 01:42:50.043
<i>All that will remain</i>

01:42:50.434 --> 01:42:52.371
<i>will be a trace of black ink</i>

01:42:53.902 --> 01:42:55.856
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

01:42:58.783 --> 01:43:01.400
<i>But I know it was real.</i>

01:43:04.557 --> 01:43:07.205
<i>I know she was real.</i>

01:43:08.853 --> 01:43:09.501
Sam?

01:43:09.619 --> 01:43:11.610
<i>And I know that one day,</i>

01:43:12.424 --> 01:43:14.204
<i>we will find a way</i>

01:43:14.650 --> 01:43:16.391
<i>to bring her back.</i>

01:43:23.067 --> 01:43:24.840
<i>Poetry</i>

01:43:26.379 --> 01:43:28.957
<i>can do incredible things.</i>
