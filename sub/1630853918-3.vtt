all just trading stuff with each other.

what should happen

he would tell the universe

14:11.851 --> 14:16.022
to put that ring in another hot dog
and then I would swallow it

14:16.106 --> 14:20.068
and then I would poop it out again
and then I would clean it off real good

14:20.151 --> 14:21.778

excited to meet you?

30:19.276 --> 30:20.736
I had an uncle I met later in life.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.822
His name was Uncle Nate.
Nice guy, but he was kind of handsy.

30:23.906 --> 30:26.408
But he had Bell's palsy,
so it wasn't too hard to fight him off.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.618
His wife was a piece of work.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.787
Everyone called her Bunny,
but she looked more like a turkey to me.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.080
She had a long, flabby chin.

But it doesn't matter
because apparently you can't be a teacher
