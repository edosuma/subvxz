WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:04.230
I thought it might be nice to get out there
and get to know each other.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.440
I think
what you really mean is

00:05.464 --> 00:07.797
you'd like to impress
the new managing partner.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.360
- And what if I did?
- You wanna impress me?

00:09.384 --> 00:11.046
Do it with a big, fat client.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.004
Zane promised Samantha
she'd be the next name partner.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.283
And did you tell him that you made
the same promise to Alex?

00:16.308 --> 00:17.344
No, I didn't.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.828
You wanna take me on,
you go for it,

00:18.852 --> 00:19.954
'cause I didn't get
where I am

00:19.978 --> 00:21.206
by letting people like you
push me around.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.973
David Fox wants a fight,
and I'm gonna give him one.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.102
A fight about what?

00:25.192 --> 00:27.400
He doesn't want to pay
our cleaning woman overtime.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.588
Harvey, this isn't what we do.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.173
- Mike would have done it.
- And Mike's not here anymore

00:30.197 --> 00:31.966
because he finally came
to terms with the fact

00:31.990 --> 00:33.071
that this isn't what we do.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.511
I'm not gonna let us start
losing clients

00:34.535 --> 00:36.596
because you decided
the cleaning staff is more important

00:36.620 --> 00:37.861
than the needs
of this firm.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.036
I didn't do anything

00:39.122 --> 00:40.892
- that you didn't sign off on.
- That's enough.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.519
You don't go to war
with the guy that owns your house

00:42.543 --> 00:45.206
over something like this.
End it, and end it today.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.662
I wanna make
a perfect baby with you.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.543
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.420
And I don't want
to just pull the goalie.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.173
I want to start trying,
and I want to start trying right now.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.346
Remember that you told me
you promised Samantha

00:56.473 --> 00:58.009
- her name would go up next?
- I did.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.466
I made Alex the same promise.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.643
Then I guess there's
only one thing to do.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.014
Kick the can
down the road.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.596
I know you think
we're in competition

01:04.690 --> 01:06.352
for the same thing,
but we're not.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.932
Robert Zane
made me a promise.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.742
The next name that goes up
on the wall is mine.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.614
Bunny rabbit
goes around the tree once,

01:16.910 --> 01:19.152
bunny rabbit goes around
the tree twice...

01:19.746 --> 01:22.784
And I say bunny rabbit,
bunny rabbit, wanna play nice?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.704
- Sheila, what are you doing?
- I'm hunting "wabbits."

01:26.003 --> 01:27.790
No, no, no. Not Fudd.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.004
You know I can't resist
Elmer Fudd.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.126
Why would you want to?

01:31.216 --> 01:33.799
Oh, my God, Shelia,
I cannot right now.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.092
Why not?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.090
Because I have
a client meeting,

01:37.180 --> 01:39.046
and it's not just me.
Zane's coming too.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.100
So whatever you had in mind,
it's going to have to wait.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.551
All right.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.682
I didn't have
to do this, but...

01:47.232 --> 01:48.348
I'm fertile,

01:49.318 --> 01:52.186
and I am ripe
for the picking.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.860
So I don't care whether
you have a meeting or not.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.316
I'm going to need
your Johnny Appleseed.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.389
Sheila, you know if there's
one thing that revs me up

02:01.413 --> 02:03.057
more than Elmer Fudd,
it's American folk heroes.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.350
Then I think it's time
for Paul Bunyan

02:04.374 --> 02:05.414
to march across
that forest

02:05.500 --> 02:06.957
and take out his ax.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.785
I'm gonna do
more than that.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.336
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.400
Because it's time for John Henry to swing
the mighty hammer.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.633
Did you know?

02:21.016 --> 02:23.008
- Know what?
- That Zane promised Samantha

02:23.101 --> 02:24.245
she was the next
name partner.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.851
Alex, let's go
back up to my office.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.257
Sounds like you could use
a drink.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.557
What I could use is some goddamn honesty.
Did you know?

02:31.443 --> 02:32.479
Yeah, I knew.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.060
Then why the hell
didn't you tell me?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.914
Because no one's deciding
anything right now,

02:35.947 --> 02:37.634
and I didn't want
to upset you for no reason.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.298
No reason? Zane promised
his right hand...

02:39.326 --> 02:40.442
I know
what he promised.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.868
But look, you got me
and you got Louis.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.411
That's two against one.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.017
When the time is right,
we'll out-vote him.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.852
And when exactly
is the time going to be right?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.617
Six months?
A year? Three years?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.369
- Alex...
- No, Harvey, I want to know

02:51.463 --> 02:52.607
when you're planning
on getting the balls

02:52.631 --> 02:53.667
to stand up to that man

02:53.757 --> 02:55.443
and what exactly I'm supposed
to do in the meantime.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.569
I'll tell you what
you're supposed to do.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.313
You're supposed to have faith
and sit tight.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.427
And if you were in my position,
would you sit tight?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.256
It may not be easy,

03:03.350 --> 03:04.886
- but, yeah, I would.
- That's funny.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.816
Because I recall you were
in a similar position

03:06.895 --> 03:08.056
years ago with Jessica,

03:08.146 --> 03:09.266
and instead
of sitting tight,

03:09.356 --> 03:11.518
you came to me
looking for another job.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.120 --> 03:24.931
- Robert, how's Wayne?
<i>- I'll tell you how he is.</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:26.349
He's getting sued,
and he wants to know

03:26.373 --> 03:27.659
why his lawyer's not here.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.353
All right, just hold down the fort
for 10 more minutes, I'm almost there.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.813
I didn't ask you
when you'd get here, Louis.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.044
I asked you where you were.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.496
That's, uh, kind of personal.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.192
<i>Well, I feel kind of bad
about that, Louis,</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:38.319
but I've been standing here
with nothing but my dick in my hand

03:38.343 --> 03:39.424
for the last 30 minutes.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.738
<i>All right, well,
if you wanna know,</i>

03:40.762 --> 03:42.156
Sheila and I are trying
to have a baby,

03:42.180 --> 03:43.546
and she's not getting
any younger,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.743
and we're just trying to take advantage
of any opportunity we can.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.803
<i>Why didn't you say so?</i>

03:46.893 --> 03:48.429
Just get here
as fast as you can.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.227
Like I said,
I'll see you in 10.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.142
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.543
You know where a Rite Aid
is around here?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.420
No, I'm sorry, I'm actually
not from around here...

03:55.444 --> 03:57.026
I don't give a shit
where you live.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.899
Do what I say,
you won't get shot.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.883
- You feel me?
- Yeah, I feel you, I feel you, I feel you.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.068
Okay, let's walk.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.783
Get on the ground,
and don't you fucking look at me.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.334
- Okay, okay...
- Wallet and phone.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.289
- Where's the phone?
- There's $1,000 in there.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.464
Is that not enough?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.237
- You think we're negotiating, here?
- No, no, no.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.363
It's just that
there's pictures

04:22.387 --> 04:23.614
on my phone
that I haven't backed up.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.504
I don't give a shit!

04:29.102 --> 04:30.513
Here's my phone.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.149
Stay down.
Don't you move.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.159
<i>See the money
wanna stay for your meal</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:57.290
<i>Get another piece of pie
for your wife</i>

04:57.380 --> 05:00.839
<i>Everybody wanna know
how it feel</i>

05:00.926 --> 05:04.215
<i>Everybody wanna see
what it's like</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:07.422
<i>I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:09.389
<i>Me and missy is so early</i>

05:09.476 --> 05:11.433
<i>Busy, busy making money</i>

05:11.520 --> 05:12.852
<i>All right!</i>

05:12.938 --> 05:16.522
<i>All step back
I'm 'bout to dance</i>

05:18.652 --> 05:20.359
<i>The greenback boogie</i>

05:26.076 --> 05:29.490
Shit.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.242
Louis, aren't you supposed to be out
with Robert Zane?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.369
I swear, if you canceled
that dinner

05:34.459 --> 05:36.621
because they ran out
of paprika like last time I...

05:37.671 --> 05:39.663
Oh, my God.
What happened, Louis?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.088
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.756
You look like
you've been hit by a car.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.007
A guy took my wallet
and my phone.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.213
I didn't know what to do,
so I came here.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.757
All right, I'm calling Sheila
and then Robert and...

05:50.851 --> 05:53.013
You're not calling
anyone, Gretchen.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.264
I don't want Robert to know.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.890
You have to tell him
what happened.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.267
I can't.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.808
- Why not?
- Because he's my new managing partner,

06:00.902 --> 06:02.814
and I do not want him
to know that I am weak.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.736
Louis, you are not weak.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.926
It could have happened to anybody.
It could have happened to him.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.052
Yeah, but it didn't.
It happened to me,

06:08.076 --> 06:09.220
and that's why
I don't want to tell him.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.324
Well, what are you
gonna do?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.472
'Cause he's gonna wanna know

06:11.496 --> 06:12.682
why you didn't show up
to that meeting.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.073
I'm going to let him think
what he already thinks.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.644
That Sheila and I,
we're trying to have a child,

06:16.668 --> 06:18.145
- it took longer than we thought...
- Louis.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.660
Gretchen, I'm done
talking about this.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.791
So will you just please
let me be?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.999
Okay, Louis,
I won't tell anybody.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.342
I'm not going anywhere
until we patch you up.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.209
If you're not careful,
the bagel guy's going to figure out

06:40.233 --> 06:41.314
you're cheating on him.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.687
Who says
this isn't a bagel?

06:42.777 --> 06:45.381
Same person who says you've got
the sense of humor of a 5-year-old.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.567
I am so going to pull
your pigtails at recess.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.898
Okay, do you want
to keep going,

06:48.992 --> 06:50.574
or can I ask you
a serious question?

06:50.869 --> 06:52.155
- You want the truth?
- No.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.867
I want to talk to you
about doing more pro bonos.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.997
- Donna.
- Harvey, listen to me.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.291
That cleaning woman's case
was good for you,

06:59.377 --> 07:01.164
and even though
Mike's not here,

07:01.254 --> 07:02.398
I think we should
keep doing them.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.709
Donna, I might be missing Mike,
but I'm not Mike,

07:04.799 --> 07:06.335
and I have a meeting
in an hour.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.713
But if you want to take on a pro bono,
knock yourself out.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.964
You know what, I do,

07:10.055 --> 07:11.449
and if you don't want it,
I'm just going to go ask Alex.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.090
- Not Alex. He's not in the mood.
- Why not?

07:14.225 --> 07:15.466
He found out
about Zane

07:15.560 --> 07:17.204
promising Samantha
name partner last night.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.435
What did you say to him?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.333
What do you think I said?
I told him to sit tight.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.168
Did you sit tight when you were
in the same position?

07:22.192 --> 07:23.603
That's what he said.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.171
Then if you don't want him doing
what you did,

07:25.195 --> 07:27.187
which is go looking
for another job,

07:27.280 --> 07:28.466
then I suggest
you do something

07:28.490 --> 07:29.731
that makes him want to stay.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.160
Now, I'm going to go ask Katrina
if she wants to do a pro bono.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.827
I don't care what it takes.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.020
You get him
in front of that judge,

07:41.044 --> 07:42.626
I'll get him off the hook.

07:42.754 --> 07:43.790
Good.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.609
Whatever you're cooking,
I need you to bump this class action

07:46.633 --> 07:47.669
to the front of the line.

07:47.759 --> 07:48.920
Class action?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.546
Yeah, why?
You got a problem with that?

07:50.637 --> 07:53.846
No problem, but litigation isn't
my specialty and you know it.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.093
So what's going on?

07:55.183 --> 07:56.219
What's going on is

07:56.309 --> 07:58.221
this was Louis Litt's case
and now it's yours.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.747
And how does
Louis Litt feel about that?

07:59.771 --> 08:01.207
I don't give a shit
about how he feels.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.267
Well, I do.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.435
I just got on
good footing around here,

08:04.526 --> 08:05.670
I'm not looking
to undo it. Now I got...

08:05.694 --> 08:08.402
Hold on, now.
You are my go-to.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.128
Don't start playing
office politics on me.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.814
Robert, I played
office politics

08:11.908 --> 08:13.865
for you for years,
in case you forgot.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.072
I didn't, but the man
pulled a no-show

08:16.162 --> 08:17.653
to a meeting
with his own client.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.956
And I need to send a message.
So are you in or out?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.994
Okay, Robert. I'm in.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.631
I'm sure whatever it is
is very important, Harvey,

08:33.763 --> 08:35.004
but I'm a little busy
right now.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.464
Alex, you were right.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.369
If I were in your shoes,
sitting tight

08:38.393 --> 08:39.679
wouldn't fly with me
either.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.518
I thought about it,
and I got an idea.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.789
Well, if it isn't
you and Louis

08:42.813 --> 08:44.350
telling Zane
my number's up next,

08:44.441 --> 08:45.761
I'm not sure
I'm going to like it.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.774
What it is,
is you doing something

08:47.861 --> 08:49.818
to put you on the map
with Zane.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.192
Paxson BioScience.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.743
They're big,
they're juicy,

08:57.829 --> 08:59.786
and we got a meeting
with them in a half an hour.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.330
- We?
- Yeah, we.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.873
Then forget it.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.187
Because if I don't sign them alone,
Robert's not going to care.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.998
Alex, I'm doing
the best I can right now.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.124
They're expecting me.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.942
I don't show up,
it's not going to look right.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.569
You've got an answer
for everything, don't you?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.154
Let's just go down there
and lock these guys down.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.171
After that, you have my word,
you're the attorney of record.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.470
All right, Harvey.
Let's go lock them down.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.727
Carrie, Harvey Specter.
This is my partner, Alex Williams.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.175
I'm sorry, I was thinking it was
just going to be the two of us.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.235
It's okay.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.033
Anything you can say in front of me,
you can say to Alex.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.405
In that case...

09:41.790 --> 09:42.826
CrytoGen.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.407
They're worth
80 million,

09:44.501 --> 09:46.709
but they're sitting
on billions of undeveloped IP.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.832
I've been trying to buy them
for two years.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.003
Let me guess,
you've used

09:50.090 --> 09:51.609
every tactic in the book
to force them to sell.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.793
Now you're looking to try some
that aren't in the book.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.630
Let's just say
that of the 15 companies

09:55.720 --> 09:58.007
that specialize in financing
that industry,

09:58.098 --> 10:01.637
14 have suddenly found themselves
out of the CrytoGen business.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.638
And isn't it the strangest
coincidence

10:03.728 --> 10:06.596
that the 15th just so happens to be
one of our clients?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.555
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.170
Just to be clear, are you asking us
to pressure one of our clients

10:11.194 --> 10:12.981
into cutting off
this company's lifeline?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.256
Because that would be
against the law.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.192
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.568
But were that to happen,

10:17.659 --> 10:20.117
you'd suddenly find yourself
with a huge new client.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.944
I'd say that sounds
pretty interesting.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.678
And I say bullshit.
It's not going happen.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.184
Well, it better, because that's what
it's going to take

10:25.208 --> 10:26.574
to get our business.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.770
Alex, why don't we
listen to...

10:27.794 --> 10:29.647
No, Harvey, I'm not looking
to cross the line for these guys,

10:29.671 --> 10:30.773
and I don't care
if they tell me

10:30.797 --> 10:32.608
they'll guarantee
a year's retainer in advance.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.626
And what if I told you that retainer
would match your highest-billing client?

10:36.719 --> 10:39.462
Look, I think it's a mistake,
but if we're going do this,

10:39.556 --> 10:41.396
we need to know
what we're getting involved in.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.424
He's right.
You want us to risk this,

10:43.518 --> 10:45.054
we need to know
every source of funding

10:45.145 --> 10:46.602
you choked off
from these guys,

10:46.688 --> 10:49.271
and every other shady thing
you've done, because like he said,

10:49.357 --> 10:52.600
I need to know exactly
what I'm getting myself involved in.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.529
Then we'll have everything
over to you by the end of the day.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.321
- Robert, got a sec?
- No, Louis, I don't.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.184
Look, I know I said
that I'd be a little late...

11:07.208 --> 11:08.978
But instead you decided
to tap your girlfriend

11:09.002 --> 11:10.322
instead of doing
your goddamn job.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.273
Robert, I told you,
we're trying to have children.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.789
You also told me you were
on your way to the meeting,

11:14.883 --> 11:16.795
and I don't appreciate
being lied to.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.171
Okay, listen to me.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.073
I know I didn't show up,
but it doesn't matter,

11:21.097 --> 11:23.009
because whatever
their issue is I can handle it.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.910
You don't have to handle it
because I already did.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.287
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means that,

11:26.311 --> 11:29.395
as of this morning,
Samantha Wheeler is handling the matter,

11:29.480 --> 11:31.417
so you have plenty of time
for your family planning.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.558
I am name partner.
This is one of my oldest clients.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.687
You cannot do this to me.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.018
I didn't do this to you.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.195
You did it to yourself
when you hung me out to dry.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.692
Robert, please.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.198
- You don't know the whole story.
- I know all I need to know.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.698
Now get out of my office

11:45.788 --> 11:46.995
and don't ever
lie to me again.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.195
Gretchen, I need you to get
to the file room right away

11:59.219 --> 12:01.836
and make every document we have
on McKinley Outfitters disappear.

12:01.930 --> 12:02.966
Can't do that, Louis.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.408
I got instructions
to send them over

12:04.432 --> 12:06.344
to Samantha Wheeler's office
an hour ago.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.845
What? How could you
do that to me?

12:07.936 --> 12:10.303
Because Robert Zane stood here
and gave me an order himself.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.012
- What choice did I have?
- God damn it.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.847
Louis, I didn't tell
the man what happened

12:13.942 --> 12:15.524
because I promised
I wouldn't,

12:15.610 --> 12:17.146
but he's punishing you
for something

12:17.237 --> 12:18.422
you don't deserve
to be punished for.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.982
So why don't you
just tell him?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.153
I'm not going to look weak.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.509
Well, having him
take your client

12:22.533 --> 12:23.761
because you don't have
the courage

12:23.785 --> 12:26.198
to tell him the truth doesn't
exactly make you look strong.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.221
Well, then I need
to take my client back.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.642
How the hell
are you going to do that?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.032
Easy.
She's a transactional woman.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.311
I'll just tell her
I owe her one.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.327
And you ask her
to go against Zane?

12:34.921 --> 12:37.083
You might as well ask her
to set herself on fire.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.485
Well, maybe if you'd goddamn help me
instead of telling me how weak I am,

12:39.509 --> 12:40.920
maybe we could
figure something out.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.127
Louis, I am trying
to help you.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.130
And if you can't see that,
then something's wrong.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.678
Gretchen, please.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.885
You're the only one
who knows

12:50.979 --> 12:52.641
that I had my dignity
taken last night.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.518
I can't have it taken again.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.855
All right, Louis.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.528
I help you with this,

13:01.614 --> 13:04.051
I need to know that you're going
to be able to keep it together.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.515
All I need is
to take my client back.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.405
- That's all I need.
- Okay.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.987
As I see it,
you want McKinley back?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.739
You need to put that woman
in a position

13:11.833 --> 13:13.825
where she doesn't have
any choice.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.984
Sounds to me like
the good folks at Paxson BioScience

13:20.008 --> 13:21.235
have been some
busy little beavers.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.467
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I sure am.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.072
If they're willing to do
all this shady shit

13:25.096 --> 13:26.949
because CrytoGen
has billions in future revenue...

13:26.973 --> 13:28.339
Why don't we skip
the shady shit

13:28.433 --> 13:30.174
and go represent
CrytoGen right now?

13:30.268 --> 13:31.600
Exactly. And we got
the road map

13:31.686 --> 13:33.326
to keeping them
out of trouble on its way.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.437
Alex, you are
one devious motherfucker.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.959
Thanks, I'll take that
as a compliment.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.646
In that case, you're a real asshole
of a guy, too.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.318
Seriously, Harvey.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.756
We're using information
they gave us

13:42.780 --> 13:43.860
in the context
of a meeting.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.738
That's a little
shady itself.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.241
- You sure you're okay with it?
- I am.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.694
Besides, what are
they gonna do?

13:49.787 --> 13:52.200
Tell the police they asked us
to rob a bank,

13:52.290 --> 13:54.498
and by the time they got there,
we moved all the money?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.667
Then the only thing
left to do is close CrytoGen.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.453
- All right, I'll set it up.
- No.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.858
You needed to be
at that last meeting.

14:00.882 --> 14:01.984
You don't need to be
at this one.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.110
- Alex...
- Harvey, let's not forget

14:03.134 --> 14:04.466
why you came to me
with this.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.134
Let me bring
this one home.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.884
All right.
They're all yours.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.356
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

14:20.902 --> 14:21.983
Well, I'm glad you did

14:22.070 --> 14:23.777
because I heard
that you gave

14:23.863 --> 14:26.276
one of Louis's clients
to Samantha.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.450
And I don't want to tell you
how to run the firm, Robert,

14:29.535 --> 14:30.696
but I think
that's a bad idea.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.366
Well, that's not exactly
what I wanted to talk about,

14:33.498 --> 14:36.536
- but I think it's a good platform.
- I don't follow.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.354
You may not want
to tell me how to do my job,

14:38.378 --> 14:39.605
but I'm going to tell you
how to do yours.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.167
- Excuse me?
- Did you assign Katrina Bennett

14:42.256 --> 14:43.963
a pro bono without
running it by me?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.778
I didn't know that I needed
to run it by you.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.043
You do when that client

14:47.136 --> 14:49.344
happens to conflict
with someone I'm trying to sign.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.339
- I didn't know they did.
- Which is why you run it by me.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.597
And was is more important is
what is a COO of a law firm doing

14:55.686 --> 14:57.348
handing out pro bonos
in the first place?

14:57.438 --> 14:58.540
I just thought
that it was good...

14:58.564 --> 14:59.875
It's a rhetorical
question, Donna.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.482
- I don't care what you thought.
- Understood.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.734
- Is that all?
- No, it's not.

15:04.821 --> 15:10.488
What a COO should be doing is maximizing
our revenue per square foot,

15:10.576 --> 15:12.112
which starts
by an assessment

15:12.203 --> 15:13.865
of our revenue
per square foot.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.265
Well, that's not really
what I do.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.782
It is now. I want a report on my desk
by end of day tomorrow.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.065
Does this have anything to do with Louis?
Because I don't think...

15:23.089 --> 15:24.625
It has to do with Louis
lying to me,

15:24.715 --> 15:27.298
and Harvey getting into it
with the landlord, and now you,

15:27.385 --> 15:28.967
which all adds up
to this law firm

15:29.053 --> 15:30.364
not operating
the way that it should,

15:30.388 --> 15:32.471
and me getting
a little tired of it.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.758
Now, that's all.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.615
Ah. Samantha, you look
nice this evening.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.782
Oh, don't give me
that shit.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.945
You want to tell me
why you set a motion to dismiss

15:56.038 --> 15:58.200
on a case for tomorrow
that I just got three hours ago?

15:58.291 --> 15:59.782
I was just
doing you a favor.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.744
But if you want to cancel it,
you go right ahead.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.565
- It's your case.
- What do you mean, "a favor"?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.956
I mean, we have two weeks
to get this suit thrown out,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.462
but the faster we file it,
the more serious they know we are.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.071
And, of course,
now that you've said it,

16:11.095 --> 16:13.052
if I delay it, I look
like I'm unprepared.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.867
Which you are, because you haven't
been their attorney

16:14.891 --> 16:16.251
for the last 13 years,
like I have.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.097
I get it. And if I tell Robert
what you did, I look weak.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.975
But if you let me help you,
we both look strong.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.877
Why didn't you
just come to me

16:24.901 --> 16:26.267
and ask me
to be let in on this?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.352
Because we both know
that you would have said no.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.027
I have to admit,
if I didn't know any better,

16:33.117 --> 16:34.358
I'd say
you're a real badass.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.554
Well, if you think
I'm a badass now,

16:35.578 --> 16:36.972
you just wait until we get
that lead plaintiff

16:36.996 --> 16:38.196
in front
of the judge tomorrow.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.410
- Hey.
- Don't "hey" me.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.623
- Did you sign them?
- Sure did, but get this.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.069
These guys aren't exactly
Little Red Riding Hood running away

16:51.093 --> 16:52.821
- from the Big Bad Wolf.
- What are you talking about?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.156
Our first assignment,
after we send

16:54.180 --> 16:55.421
that cease and desist
to Paxson,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.051
is to trick
their best employee

16:57.141 --> 16:58.632
into a lifetime
of servitude.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.286
Don't tell me
you're pulling a Mike Ross

17:00.353 --> 17:01.633
and having
second thoughts on me.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.181
I'm just saying, there aren't
any saints in this situation.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.108
But you know what, brother?
That's why we make the big bucks.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.693
Well, then, pour us
a couple of drinks,

17:10.780 --> 17:13.396
and I'll fax the cease
and desist order right away.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.691
You're
not faxing shit.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.637
Do you really think that you can take
a meeting with a prospective client,

17:17.662 --> 17:19.806
try to screw them over,
and they wouldn't catch wind of it?

17:19.829 --> 17:21.058
I don't care if they
caught wind of it.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.476
There's nothing that
they can do about it.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.492
Bullshit, they can let
every major player know

17:24.585 --> 17:26.577
that we don't deal
with our clients in good faith.

17:26.671 --> 17:27.707
But they have the decency

17:27.797 --> 17:29.608
to give us a chance
to make it right before they do,

17:29.632 --> 17:30.712
and you're going
to take it.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.236
If you're saying
what I think you're saying...

17:32.260 --> 17:34.718
I'm saying drop the small potato,
and sign Paxson,

17:34.804 --> 17:36.484
like you said you would
in the first place.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.763
You want to talk
bad faith?

17:37.848 --> 17:40.841
We went in there, and they all
but asked us to commit a crime.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.222
Then don't sign them,
but what you don't do

17:43.312 --> 17:45.207
is go using the information
that you got from them

17:45.231 --> 17:46.847
to sign a guy
that they were going after.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.102
And the last time
I checked,

17:48.192 --> 17:49.872
I can sign whoever the hell
I want to sign.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.235
Harvey, I cut you some slack
on that landlord thing.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.654
But I'm running this firm,
not you.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.051
You're going to do
what I tell you to do.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.344
You going to tell me
what suit to wear, too?

17:57.368 --> 17:58.404
Listen to me.

17:59.245 --> 18:03.455
Tomorrow morning, I come in,
Paxson's our client.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.703
And I'm done
discussing this topic.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.214
Harvey, maybe
it isn't worth it.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.714
Relax, he'll calm down
once he realizes

18:15.803 --> 18:18.170
that small potato
is not so small.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.597
Are you crazy?
This is about chain of command.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.245
And the only reason we signed those guys
in the first place was to impress him.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.163
And you were the one
who wanted me to have the balls

18:25.187 --> 18:26.223
to stand up to him.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.601
Well, I don't give a shit
what the chain of command is.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.273
There's no way
I'm backing down now.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.726
Harvey, I told you, it's not
like these guys are saints.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.340
- What they're having me do to this guy...
- Alex, that's enough.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.230
I'm not interested
in you second guessing me,

18:37.325 --> 18:40.818
and I'm sure as shit not interested
in you doing it on Zane's behalf.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.447
So you want
to have a drink

18:42.538 --> 18:44.951
and celebrate signing
a new client or not?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.847
Robert, what are
you doing here?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.008
I'm here because
it's tomorrow morning,

19:05.102 --> 19:06.968
and you didn't sign
Paxson yet.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.100
Look, Robert, as far
as I'm concerned,

19:10.191 --> 19:11.376
this is between
you and Harvey.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.503
- Well, I'm making it between you and me.
- What are you saying?

19:13.527 --> 19:14.734
I'm saying
you're a smart guy,

19:14.820 --> 19:17.813
and we both know what your
endgame is at this firm.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.398
If you want that game
to be a reality,

19:19.492 --> 19:20.949
you do what
I need you to do.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.180
- Are you threatening my job?
- I'm telling you how it is.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.070
You dealt with that client
in bad faith.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.309
I'm doing you a courtesy
by dealing with you in good faith.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.435
It sure doesn't
feel like it.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.936
I didn't say
I was giving you kid gloves,

19:29.960 --> 19:31.826
I said I was
playing you straight.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.796
The truth is
I like you, always have.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.632
But if you don't get yourself
on the right of this thing,

19:37.760 --> 19:39.960
you're never going to go further
than you are right now.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.548
- Robert...
- Drop them.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.058
I don't want to hear
another goddamn thing about it.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.693
Okay, what's our plan?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.941
Okay, listen up.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.397
They don't know it,

20:00.491 --> 20:02.177
but we're going to file
for a change of venue

20:02.201 --> 20:03.692
in addition to our
motion to dismiss.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.264
I don't understand. Changing the venue
to Omaha doesn't help us.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.849
- The laws are harsher there.
- Doesn't matter.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.114
Because the jury won't be.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.245
- What do you mean?
- This lawsuit

20:11.335 --> 20:14.624
wasn't just filed by a random bunch
of disgruntled backpackers.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.671
- It was orchestrated.
- By who?

20:16.757 --> 20:17.964
Our biggest competitor.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.836
And it just so happens, Omaha
used to be their headquarters.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.672
Which is now a ghost town.
We go after them in Omaha,

20:24.807 --> 20:26.243
they're going to get
their asses kicked.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.036
And they'll have no grounds
to fight the change of venue,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.393
because on the face of it,
it's against our interests.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.186
- Exactly.
- Louis, this is genius.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.687
Yeah, I know. But like I said, you think
I'm a genius now, you just wait.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.213
Because by the end of today,
they're going to be paying us.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.353
All rise.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.655
Oh, shit, I have an emergency
with my oldest client.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.449
- You sure you got this?
- Oh, I got this.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.135
I just feel bad for you because you're not
going to get to see it.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.036
All right.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.333
We're here
for a motion to dismiss.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.960
Mr. Litt, do you have
your paperwork?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.082
Your Honor, I'm sorry,

20:57.173 --> 20:59.165
but due to recent information
coming to light,

21:00.134 --> 21:02.296
we need to alter our motion
to change of venue.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.299
What? They have
no basis for that.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.255
We believe we do,
Your Honor.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.638
Which is why we'd like to call
their lead plaintiff to the stand.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.814
Mind if I cut in?

21:16.901 --> 21:18.563
That depends,
is it urgent?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.894
To tell you the truth,
it is.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.729
Zane already thinks
I overstep my bounds.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.050
The last thing I need
is for him to think

21:24.074 --> 21:26.157
that I can't hand in
my homework on time, too.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.281
Well, if that's what he thinks about you,
you can have the copier,

21:29.371 --> 21:31.408
and Robert Zane
can go fuck himself.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.874
Hey. Everything okay?

21:35.252 --> 21:36.743
- Never been better.
- Alex.

21:36.837 --> 21:37.939
I'm really not
in the mood, Donna.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.797
Yeah, I can see that,
and I don't care.

21:40.883 --> 21:41.919
What's going on?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.921
All right,
you want to know?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.799
First thing this morning,
Zane tells me unless I sign Paxson,

21:46.889 --> 21:48.471
my name's never
going up on that wall.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.512
- What? Have you told Harvey about this?
- What good would it do?

21:51.602 --> 21:53.663
Harvey's the one who put me
in this goddamn situation.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.208
Wait, hang on a second, I thought
you were on board with going after CrytoGen.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.751
I don't give a shit
what I was on board with.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.961
When Zane didn't want to do it,
I was ready to back off.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.317
- Then back off.
- And I do that,

22:01.403 --> 22:03.465
I might as well kiss my chances
at name partner goodbye.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.649
Alex, I don't think you're
giving Harvey enough credit.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.780
He said, and I quote,

22:06.867 --> 22:08.929
"I'm sure as shit not interested
in you second guessing me

22:08.953 --> 22:09.993
"on Robert Zane's behalf."

22:11.205 --> 22:13.322
- Good.
- What do you mean, "good"?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.156
I mean you're in
a Kobayashi Maru.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.770
What the hell does sushi
have to do with this?

22:16.794 --> 22:18.660
It's not sushi,
it's from <i>Star Trek,</i>

22:18.754 --> 22:21.713
and Harvey's been talking about it
for a hundred years.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.277
I always thought it was bullshit,
but maybe it's not.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.293
- What do you mean?
- I mean, sooner or later,

22:26.387 --> 22:29.175
everyone finds themselves walled into
a no-win situation.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.468
This one's yours,

22:31.559 --> 22:33.801
and the way to prove yourself
to both Harvey and Zane

22:33.894 --> 22:35.260
is to find a way out anyway.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.724
Well, thanks, Donna.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.209
And here I thought going to Harvard
was the way to get ahead,

22:39.233 --> 22:42.351
when really, I should have
just been watching old <i>Star Treks.</i>

22:42.528 --> 22:45.423
Well, I didn't, so unless the answer is
in an episode of <i>Cagney & Lacey...</i>

22:45.447 --> 22:46.883
You know what, Alex?
I'm trying to help you.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.944
And I told you, I'm not
in the goddamn mood.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.474
Okay, then let me put it
another way.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.973
Unless you think you can get your name
on the wall some place else,

22:52.997 --> 22:54.683
I suggest you stop
worrying about the problem

22:54.707 --> 22:56.243
and start worrying
about the solution.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.094
Because if you can't find a way
to get yourself out of this situation,

22:59.503 --> 23:01.995
maybe you don't deserve
to be name partner after all.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.174
So, Mr. Larson, when did you
decide to file this lawsuit?

23:09.263 --> 23:12.597
About a week after I found out
hackers stole my information.

23:12.683 --> 23:15.426
So you were upset,
and then you contacted a lawyer.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.431
Actually, my attorney
reached out to me.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.623
Wasn't that convenient?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.559
Your Honor,
soliciting clients isn't a crime,

23:20.649 --> 23:22.265
and it's not relevant
to change of venue.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.421
But isn't it? Mr. Larson, when your lawyer
approached you,

23:24.445 --> 23:26.152
what was the fee
that you were quoted?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.774
10%, contingent
on winning.

23:27.865 --> 23:32.235
And are you aware that the normal fee
for this type of case is three times that?

23:32.328 --> 23:33.680
I'm not one to say no
to a bargain.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.932
You mean the bargain
where my client's biggest competitor

23:35.956 --> 23:37.367
was paying your lawyers
on the side?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.120
- What?
- Objection, speculative.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.520
It won't be
when he answers the question.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.730
Your Honor,
where is this going?

23:41.754 --> 23:42.981
I'll tell you where
it's going. Your Honor,

23:43.005 --> 23:45.088
it's going
to conspiracy charges

23:45.174 --> 23:48.588
because he approached him
to put my client out of business.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.793
I didn't...

23:50.763 --> 23:52.073
- I don't...
- Answer the question.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.555
I didn't ask how my lawyer
makes his ends meet

23:54.642 --> 23:57.305
- because I'm focused on mine.
- Let's focus on yours.

23:57.394 --> 24:01.013
Because if I find out that you knew
they were driving this lawsuit

24:01.106 --> 24:04.099
and you lied about it, oh,
I'm going to come for your house.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.712
And then, I'm going to come
for your pension.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.648
- Objection.
- And your daughter's piggy bank.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.737
- Badgering.
- I'm not doing anything

24:09.823 --> 24:12.907
a federal prosecutor won't do
if he doesn't tell the truth.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.221
Yes, you are. You are pointing a gun
at my client's head,

24:15.245 --> 24:18.165
and I'm pretty damn sure you wouldn't
like it if I pointed a gun at yours.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.670
Mr. Litt?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.676
Mr. Litt?

24:39.186 --> 24:40.927
Lay down and shut up.

24:41.021 --> 24:43.513
And this time,
you don't give me your wallet

24:43.607 --> 24:45.849
and give me your phone
and keep your mouth shut,

24:46.276 --> 24:47.767
I won't just kick you.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.694
I'll pull this trigger,

24:50.114 --> 24:53.448
and you'll never see anyone
you care about ever again.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.079
Mr. Litt, for the last time,
do you have anything further?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.541
Motions to dismiss
and change of venue are denied.

25:17.975 --> 25:20.683
You and I need to talk,
and we need to talk right now.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.805
No, we don't.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.082
And if you know what's good for you,
you'll get out.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.268
I'm not going anywhere
until you explain to me

25:26.358 --> 25:29.146
how one minute, you're ready to book
one-way tickets to Omaha,

25:29.236 --> 25:31.444
and the next minute,
I find out we've all but lost.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.398
You weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.196
I know that. That's
what I'm doing here.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.782
- And I told you to get out.
- And I told you

25:39.872 --> 25:42.785
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what happened.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.539
Listen to me, I did
the best I could,

25:46.628 --> 25:48.665
and I do not want
to talk about this anymore.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.213
The best you could?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.502
You're not some
first-year associate.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.459
You're a goddamn
name partner

25:54.553 --> 25:56.510
who bullied his way
onto my case.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.742
And the next thing I know,
you've laid down like a dog,

25:58.766 --> 26:01.053
- let yourself get kicked...
- You weren't there!

26:02.561 --> 26:03.768
You weren't there.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.185
You don't know
the shit I went through.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.104
You never will.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.238
Now back the hell off,
and get the hell out of my office.

26:17.785 --> 26:20.869
Louis, relax. I was
just trying to...

26:20.954 --> 26:22.195
Get the hell out!

26:48.107 --> 26:49.459
Harvey, can I talk to you
for a second?

26:49.483 --> 26:51.065
Sure, what's on your mind?

26:51.151 --> 26:52.892
I just got a call
from Holly Cromwell.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.399
Don't tell me, she's got another firm
wanting to recruit you,

26:55.489 --> 26:57.321
and you're looking
to leverage us.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.401
- Harvey, this is serious.
- What is it?

27:00.494 --> 27:02.222
She told me
that Alex Williams called her up,

27:02.246 --> 27:04.015
looking to see what he could get
in the marketplace.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.371
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.684
He wants to know
what the odds are

27:06.708 --> 27:08.353
of him getting his name
on the wall somewhere else.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.664
I don't believe it.
How could he do this to me?

27:10.754 --> 27:13.087
Maybe instead of thinking about
how he could do this,

27:13.173 --> 27:14.664
you might want
to think about why.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.236
- I don't care why.
- Well, you should.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.071
Because you made it personal
between you and Zane,

27:18.095 --> 27:19.882
and Alex became nothing
but an afterthought.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.491
How do you even know
about any of this?

27:21.515 --> 27:23.515
Because before he talked
to Holly, he talked to me.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.097
Which is why I know that Zane
went to Alex this morning

27:27.187 --> 27:28.849
and told him
if he didn't sign Paxson,

27:28.939 --> 27:30.601
he'd never make
name partner here at all.

27:30.691 --> 27:31.727
Where is he?

27:32.651 --> 27:35.394
Harvey, if you confront Zane,
it's just going to make things worse.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.319
I don't care. I am
not going to let him

27:37.406 --> 27:38.942
bully my guy
into submission.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.080
Hang up the phone
right the hell now.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.908
Don't walk into my office
and tell me that.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.585
So I can't walk in here,
but you can walk into my guy's office

27:52.671 --> 27:53.752
and threaten his career?

27:53.839 --> 27:56.331
I didn't threaten his career.
I just told him like it was.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.633
- That's not your call.
- Bullshit, it's not.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.197
I gave you an order,
and if you're not going to follow it,

28:01.221 --> 28:02.587
I'm going
to the next man down.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.951
And if he doesn't listen to me,
he's never getting my vote.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.077
So he's got
to listen to you,

28:06.101 --> 28:07.412
but he doesn't have
to listen to me?

28:07.436 --> 28:09.928
What the hell do you think
Managing Partner means?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.888
Well, if this is
what it means,

28:11.982 --> 28:13.689
then maybe I made
a bad call

28:13.775 --> 28:15.767
in being gracious
and letting you have it.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.353
You weren't being gracious.
You were recognizing reality.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.985
Which is that I'm better
at this than you.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.281
And what you're better at

28:22.367 --> 28:25.075
is doing whatever you feel like doing
at any goddamn minute.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.246
Well, what I feel like saying
right now is Alex is my guy.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.540
He does what I say,
and that's final.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.229
Well, that's too bad, because I didn't do
what either one of you said,

28:33.253 --> 28:34.573
and it's too late
to take it back.

28:34.755 --> 28:35.916
I don't believe this.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.865
Are you saying
you took another job?

28:37.925 --> 28:40.028
No, I'm saying I got someone else
to take another job.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.279
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:41.303 --> 28:43.420
CrytoGen wanted me to trick
their biggest asset

28:43.513 --> 28:45.254
into a lifetime
of servitude.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.682
Instead, I informed him of his
right to go out on his own

28:47.768 --> 28:49.304
and signed him
as our newest client.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.681
Are you out of your mind?
I told you to sign Paxson.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.092
And the reason
you gave both of us

28:53.148 --> 28:55.335
was that you didn't want us dealing
with them in bad faith.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.395
Well, now we didn't.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.442
All we did was take a meeting
and not sign them.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.923
And you still didn't do
what I asked.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.299
And you didn't do
what I asked, either.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.723
You're right, I didn't.
Because if all you want is a yes-man,

29:03.784 --> 29:04.928
then what the hell
am I doing here?

29:04.952 --> 29:06.429
- You listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.412
I signed a client that's going to be worth
a huge amount to this firm.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.364
I'm a hell
of a goddamn lawyer,

29:11.458 --> 29:12.619
and if you can't see that,

29:12.709 --> 29:14.312
then I don't want to have
my name next to yours.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.749
- Alex...
- No, I said what I had to say.

29:16.838 --> 29:19.205
As far as I'm concerned,
you two need to work your shit out.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.450
I don't know about you, but I kind
of like the guy when he's angry.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.887
Yeah, you would,
because that's the same flavored bullshit

29:29.977 --> 29:31.343
that you served Jessica.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.020
What now?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.711
I need to talk to you
about your partner.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.195
- You mean Robert?
- I mean Louis Litt.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.819
- What about him?
- Something's wrong with him.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.616
And before you tell me
I don't know him,

29:47.703 --> 29:50.696
I'm telling you,
this isn't normal behavior.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.202
Even for a man
with his reputation.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.666
- How can you know that?
- How about I start by saying

29:55.752 --> 29:58.415
he stood up his own clients
at a meeting with Robert Zane?

29:58.505 --> 30:00.497
And then somehow
shit the bed in court

30:00.590 --> 30:02.081
on a case he had
in the bank.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.112
And I'm not even going
to get into how he treated me

30:04.136 --> 30:06.048
when I tried
to ask him about it.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.800
Does anyone else know
about any of this?

30:07.889 --> 30:09.881
Judging by the look
I saw on his secretary's face,

30:09.975 --> 30:11.216
I'd say she does.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.518
I'd also say she's not
going to tell me a thing.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.061
Why are you telling me
about this, and not Robert?

30:21.653 --> 30:25.067
Because I may be new here,
but I know what friendship looks like.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.782
And right now,
I'm telling you,

30:28.869 --> 30:30.201
Louis Litt needs a friend.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.920
- Harvey.
- Louis.

30:42.716 --> 30:43.752
You got
any plans tonight?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.482
I was thinking
we could go out for dinner.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.506
That's not going
to work for me.

30:47.596 --> 30:48.698
I have to get home
to Sheila.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.260
Oh, come on. We've got
some stuff to catch up on.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.925
- What stuff?
- From what I hear,

30:54.019 --> 30:55.219
you've had a rough
couple days.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.805
It's all good, Harvey.
Nothing to worry about.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.231
All good? Come on.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.559
I ask you to dinner
once in a blue moon.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.814
Whenever I do,
you drop everything.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.862
I used to,
but I have Sheila now,

31:06.948 --> 31:08.985
so if you'll excuse me.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.109
You're not leaving
until I get an answer.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.284
Don't hide behind Sheila.

31:12.496 --> 31:13.828
Get the hell off me!

31:14.873 --> 31:15.989
What's going on, Louis?

31:16.625 --> 31:18.662
- Nothing.
- You can talk to me.

31:19.336 --> 31:22.170
- About what? There's nothing...
- Why'd you roll over in court?

31:22.255 --> 31:24.963
- Why'd you no-show at dinner?
- Please stop.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.416
Why do you need me
to stop, Louis?

31:26.551 --> 31:29.464
- What are you so scared of?
- God damn it, I was mugged.

31:30.931 --> 31:34.891
I was mugged, and I thought
I was going to die, okay?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.227
He had a gun

31:39.606 --> 31:41.893
that he had pressed
to the back of my head.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.401
I can still feel it.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.465
Is that what
you want to hear?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.025
Because that's
what's going on.

31:49.783 --> 31:50.943
It's okay, buddy.
You're okay.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.574
But it's not okay, Harvey.
It's not, I'm a mess.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.118
I'd be a mess, too.
Anyone would.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.126
- What if it doesn't go away?
- It will.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.579
I don't know how long it'll take
or when it'll happen,

32:04.673 --> 32:05.834
but I know one thing.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.528
It won't go away
if you don't talk about it,

32:08.552 --> 32:09.838
and I don't just mean
therapy.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.590
- Harvey...
- Look, you have people here

32:11.680 --> 32:13.842
who care about you.
Don't hide it from them.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.139
I'm not telling Robert.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.884
- Why not?
- Because you're my friend,

32:18.854 --> 32:21.062
and he's my boss,
and he just got here,

32:21.148 --> 32:22.980
and I cannot have him
see me as weak.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.641
He won't think you're weak.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.860
He'll think you're strong
for telling him.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.438
But I won't be strong.
I'm going to turn into this.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.278
Look at me, Harvey.
Look at me.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.744
I can't have him
see me like this.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.703
Why don't I tell him for you?

32:41.793 --> 32:44.410
We've got some things
to work out between us anyway.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.792
- Thank you, Harvey.
- That would be nice.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.701
- What is it, Donna?
- Robert, I have your report.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.909
But before you read it,
I need to tell you what I told you before.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.325
This isn't really
what I do.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.252
- Why bring it to me at all?
- Because you asked for it.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.877
And more importantly,
what I do is what you need right now.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.046
So let me
get this straight.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.926
You're going to come in here
with a half-assed excuse for a report

33:34.012 --> 33:35.132
and then tell me
what I need?

33:35.180 --> 33:36.216
Yeah, I am,

33:36.306 --> 33:38.409
because while you wanted me
to be spending my time on something

33:38.433 --> 33:40.675
you could've hired
an accounting firm for,

33:40.769 --> 33:42.556
I was busy working my ass off

33:42.646 --> 33:46.105
maximizing revenue per square foot
the old-fashioned way.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.294
- By keeping this place together.
- What are you talking about?

33:48.318 --> 33:50.685
I'm just saying that between picking
a fight with Harvey,

33:50.779 --> 33:52.111
taking a client away
from Louis,

33:52.197 --> 33:53.466
and whatever else
you've been up to,

33:53.490 --> 33:55.343
you didn't notice that
one of your star attorneys

33:55.367 --> 33:56.653
was thinking
about leaving.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.905
And now, thanks to me,
he's going to stay.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.156
You're talking
about Alex?

34:00.247 --> 34:02.455
Yes, of course
I'm talking about Alex.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.332
Then, Donna,
I appreciate what you did.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.622
But if he left,
he left. So be it.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.625
Because if I'm going
to lead this firm,

34:10.715 --> 34:12.251
people need to follow
my orders.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.880
Maybe the problem
isn't with the orders, Robert.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.610
Maybe it's with the man
who's giving them.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.262
You may not want
to hear this,

34:18.348 --> 34:20.304
but I'm going
to say it anyway.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.764
You think that the reason
Rand and Calder turned on you

34:23.853 --> 34:25.719
is because you had
a soft spot for us.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.850
I think it's because you didn't have
a soft spot for them.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.630
And if you treat us
the way you treated them,

34:32.654 --> 34:34.440
the same thing's
going to happen here.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.569
I can't just let everyone
do what they want.

34:37.701 --> 34:38.817
It's not in me.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.866
I'm just saying, sometimes
we need to be smacked in line,

34:42.956 --> 34:44.618
and sometimes,

34:44.708 --> 34:47.951
you need to let us do
what we do the way we do it.

34:52.841 --> 34:56.835
I'm going to farm out
this revenue per square foot

34:56.928 --> 34:58.169
to an accounting firm.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.305
Thanks, Robert.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.305
What?

35:05.395 --> 35:08.308
I knew you did this
whisperer shit with Harvey,

35:08.398 --> 35:10.811
but I didn't think
you'd ever do it to me.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.108
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret, Zane.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.730
I do it to everybody.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.116
Alex, you got a second?

35:28.710 --> 35:30.270
That depends on what
you're here to say.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.002
I'm here to say
I'm sorry.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.233
I put you in a position
that I shouldn't have,

35:34.257 --> 35:36.749
but I also want to say,

35:36.843 --> 35:38.523
you didn't have to talk
to that headhunter.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.549
- Yeah, Harvey, I did.
- Why?

35:42.432 --> 35:45.516
You want to know the truth?
I had to know what kind of leverage I had.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.973
And it turns out,
there wasn't anybody willing

35:48.063 --> 35:50.555
to put my name on the wall
any faster than you.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.501
Which is what left me open
to hear Donna's bullshit.

35:52.525 --> 35:53.836
What do you mean,
"Donna's bullshit"?

35:53.860 --> 35:56.339
It's really your bullshit.
She said I was in a no-win situation,

35:56.363 --> 35:58.025
and I could bitch
and moan about it,

35:58.114 --> 35:59.354
or I could
get out of it myself.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.570
- Kobayashi Maru.
- Yeah.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.118
Yeah, well, you got yourself out
pretty damn well,

36:04.204 --> 36:06.196
and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.621
Zane was pretty
impressed, too.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.374
Then I guess
I got the job done.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.648
And maybe I should have watched
a little <i>Star Trek</i> growing up after all.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.459
What? How could you
never watch <i>Star Trek?</i>

36:15.548 --> 36:17.540
Because it's a stupid show
with shitty effects.

36:17.634 --> 36:18.986
You realize I love that show,
right?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.112
I don't care
how you feel about it.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.656
It's a stupid show
with shitty effects.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.721
You know what, Alex?
You may be a hell of a lawyer,

36:23.765 --> 36:26.405
but if you can't appreciate
the original <i>Star Trek,</i> you're nothing,

36:26.434 --> 36:29.427
because Captain Kirk is
the best television character ever created.

36:29.521 --> 36:33.140
I've got two words for you,
motherfucker. <i>Magnum, P.I.</i>

36:33.692 --> 36:35.211
Those are fighting words.
You know that, right?

36:35.235 --> 36:36.504
They're not
fighting words, Harvey.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.564
They're drinking words.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.816
So sit on down,
and let's hash this out

36:39.906 --> 36:42.398
like two people who can
both appreciate <i>M♪A♪S♪H.</i>

36:42.909 --> 36:43.945
Sounds good to me.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.094
- Robert.
- Before you say anything,

37:04.180 --> 37:06.547
let me just say that I'm sorry
for what happened,

37:06.641 --> 37:08.633
and I'm more sorry
for how I treated you.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.343
I appreciate that,
Robert.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.595
But this was my fault,
not yours.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.646
Louis, this is
not your fault.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.062
And I want you to know
you could have come to me.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.735
I just felt so powerless.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.427
Of course, you did.
You were a victim.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.402
But that doesn't mean
you have to feel like one.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.159
How can I not feel like one?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.658
Louis, I'm going to tell you
something nobody knows.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.123
I grew up in a rough place
with rough people.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.701
Don't tell me that you know
what it's like to get mugged?

37:35.795 --> 37:37.606
No, what I'm trying
to tell you is I know what it's like

37:37.630 --> 37:38.962
to be on the
other end of it.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.499
- What?
- I was 14 years old.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.631
My friends were all I knew,
and I loved them.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.422
But they were messed up.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.910
And one night,
they get it in their heads

37:51.978 --> 37:53.458
that they were going
to roll somebody,

37:53.521 --> 37:55.387
and I got caught up in it.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.436
The guy fought back.
We had no choice.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.438
We beat him good,
put him in the hospital.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.315
- Jesus.
- I know.

38:03.323 --> 38:08.034
I only did it once,
and it's haunted me my whole life.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.155
Still does.

38:09.245 --> 38:12.989
Are you saying that I should
feel sorry for the man who mugged me?

38:13.082 --> 38:15.324
No, no, no. I'm not
saying that, Louis.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.161
I'm saying that someday,

38:18.254 --> 38:20.746
he's going to have to
face up to who he is,

38:20.840 --> 38:22.877
and he'll carry that shame
for a lifetime.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.503
But you don't have to

38:24.594 --> 38:27.803
because this doesn't have
a single thing to do with who you are.

38:28.765 --> 38:31.178
- You hearing me?
- I'm hearing you.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.556
Good, and, Louis,
we are a family here.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.480
So from now on,
I want you to remember,

38:37.565 --> 38:39.272
you can share things
with your family.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.147
- Okay.
- I mean, for God's sake.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.758
You didn't think twice about telling me
you were tapping your woman.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.114
- That's a fair point.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.119
Okay. Good man.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.581
- You heading home for the night?
- I was, why?

38:59.671 --> 39:01.398
I just wanted to let you know,
I talked to Alex,

39:01.422 --> 39:03.163
and it's all good.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.875
- That's great, Harvey.
- There's just one thing.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.256
It turns out that
he didn't call Holly Cromwell.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.054
- She called him.
- So?

39:11.140 --> 39:14.099
So if she called him,
why would she then call you

39:14.185 --> 39:16.677
- and say he called her?
- I guess she wouldn't.

39:16.771 --> 39:20.685
I guess I must have called her
and told her to call him.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.151
- Mind if I ask why?
- Because, Harvey,

39:24.237 --> 39:27.025
sometimes people just need
to know where they stand.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.915
And what if he'd been able
to leverage himself

39:28.950 --> 39:30.486
into name partner
somewhere else?

39:30.618 --> 39:33.986
Then you and Robert Zane would learn
that if you can't figure your shit out,

39:34.080 --> 39:36.197
the only people who are
going to get hurt are you.

39:50.805 --> 39:54.264
- Samantha, what are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you.

39:55.810 --> 39:56.996
Look, if this is
about earlier...

39:57.020 --> 39:58.852
It is about earlier,
but not how you think.

39:59.856 --> 40:03.224
I came here to tell you that the same thing
that happened to you

40:03.318 --> 40:05.087
- happened to me.
- Robert told you, didn't he?

40:05.111 --> 40:06.147
He did.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.650
And when it happened,
he was there for me.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.092
So now, I'm going
to be there for you.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.760
I'm sorry, what do you mean,
"he was there for you"?

40:11.784 --> 40:13.616
That's not important.
What is important

40:13.703 --> 40:15.990
is you're going to start
learning self-defense.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.308
And you're going
to start right now.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.073
I really appreciate you
coming by.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.124
Okay? But I'm going
to go inside.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.331
Tell me the truth.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.232
When you saw me standing there,
and you couldn't make out

40:25.256 --> 40:27.176
whether it was me or not,
you were scared, right?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.593
I don't want to learn
self-defense.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.046
Do me a favor.
Try to hit me.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.177
- I'm not going to hit you.
- Try to hit me.

40:37.727 --> 40:38.888
Okay.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.511
Ready? Boop.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.000
- That's pretty crazy, right...
- Would you just try to hit me?

40:43.024 --> 40:44.356
All right, fine.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.776
All right, mother...

40:49.030 --> 40:50.362
Oh, my God.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.189
You could kill someone,
couldn't you?

40:52.283 --> 40:55.526
Probably, but the point is,
they couldn't kill me.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.908
Now, get up, it's time
for your first lesson.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.704
First things first, you got to be aware
of your surroundings,

41:02.794 --> 41:04.251
and you got to learn
how to stand.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.087
Okay.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.169
- Show me.
- Okay.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.254
You want to stabilize
your core,

41:15.348 --> 41:19.012
so one foot slightly behind the other,
about hip-width apart.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.329
- See how it stabilizes?
- The core.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.747
- Yeah.
- Okay, so how many calories

41:21.771 --> 41:24.309
- have I burned just now?
- Three.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.602
Just because you're
talking so much.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.104
- Right, okay.
- Yeah.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.028
All right.
Now, smack me.
