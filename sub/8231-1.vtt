- Ders,
I am the better beatboxer.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.533
- Blake, your beatbox
is a weak box.

00:13.633 --> 00:16.333
- Oh, Blake,

00:16.433 --> 00:18.333
you gonna let
him talk to you like that?

00:18.433 --> 00:20.533
You better battle back.

00:20.633 --> 00:21.367
- Yeah.
- Now?

00:21.467 --> 00:22.867
- Yep.
- No, no. Not now.

00:22.967 --> 00:24.133
I mean, I have to,
like, warm up.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.500
- Okay? See?
- I would need hot tea.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.733
- Oh.
- It's just a whole process.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.433
- Beatbox, Blake!
- Let's go.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.867
- Okay, just let me
put the record on.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.100
- Ho, ho, ho!

00:46.200 --> 00:48.133
Ders, is it too hot to handle?

00:48.233 --> 00:49.400
Hit us with it.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.900
- All right,
here we go, here we go.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.133
- Okay.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.000
Well, I'm about
to turn in, kids.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.067
What are you gonna do?

00:55.167 --> 00:56.833
We're gonna party, Daddy!

00:56.933 --> 00:59.867
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-party.
P-party, Daddy.

[beatboxing poorly]
Party, Daddy.

[continues beatboxing poorly]

01:06.867 --> 01:08.267
- Whoo! Whoo!

01:08.367 --> 01:09.067
It's too hot in here.

01:09.133 --> 01:11.533
Blake, hit 'em with it!

01:11.633 --> 01:12.533
- Okay.

goddamn loony tunes.

- Adam, we're not that good.

[The Skinny Boys' "Jockbox"]

01:50.833 --> 01:51.800
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.633
- It's a real gummy meat.

01:53.733 --> 01:56.367
I don't like it when the meat
stops being chewy, right?

01:56.467 --> 01:57.600
- Because then you
get a longer meal.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.067
Because you're chewing.
You don't just swallow.

01:59.133 --> 02:00.367
- Right.
- Yeah.

02:00.467 --> 02:02.300
You get more bite

02:02.400 --> 02:04.667

a wet paper towel in a way.

Mm-hmm.

- Hey.

02:19.067 --> 02:21.167
- It's Cushing.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.833
Cushing Ward.
We used to work here together.

02:22.933 --> 02:24.133
- Oh, yeah.

02:24.233 --> 02:26.067
- Oh. What's up, dude?
- Wow.

02:26.133 --> 02:27.433
- I mean,
I didn't recognize you.

02:27.533 --> 02:28.667
You've lost a lot of weight,
and your--

02:28.767 --> 02:31.533
Your skin looks fantastic.
It's so shiny.

02:31.633 --> 02:33.067
- You used to look horrible.
- Yeah.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.333
- Yeah, well, I lost,
like, 70 pounds,

02:34.433 --> 02:36.967
started using essential oils,
2-4-7, 3-6-5.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.233
- Sure.
- That's cool.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.300
I can relate because I recently
lost four pounds

02:42.400 --> 02:44.933
and started using a loofah
with Old Spice Swagger.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.433
So we're like the same dude.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.567
- Yeah, totally. Totally, man.
So what's the deal?

02:49.667 --> 02:51.767
I'm getting, like, a real
"Ballers" vibe from you, man.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.600
You working with athletes?
Is that what that is?

02:53.700 --> 02:55.333
- No, I'm still doing
telemarketing for TAC.

02:55.433 --> 02:57.200
Work at the Van Nuys branch.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.800
Just dropped something off
for Alice.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.433
- What?

03:00.533 --> 03:02.067
You--you're a telemarketer
and you drive a Porsche?

03:02.133 --> 03:03.500
- No, you a coke dealer.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.767
That's how you got
so skinny, huh?

03:04.867 --> 03:07.467
- No, no, no, no, no,
still working at Van Nuys.

03:07.567 --> 03:08.600
Just a whole different world
over there.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.067
- Huh.

03:11.133 --> 03:14.067
- Guy that runs the place, JP,
is just a real leader.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.433
If it wasn't for him,

03:16.533 --> 03:18.600
I'd probably still be living
with a bunch of dudes,

03:18.700 --> 03:21.267
smoking weed all day,
eating Yoshinoya,

03:21.367 --> 03:24.067
driving my old shitty car,
not this car.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.933
- Yeah, I'm with you, man.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.200
I drive that Range Rover.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.233
That's mine.
That's what I drive.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.667
I own that car.
- Yep.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.367
- So...
- It's backing away, your car.

03:32.467 --> 03:33.700
- Ah, okay, so...

03:33.800 --> 03:35.067
that lady's probably
taking it for a wash, you know?

03:35.167 --> 03:37.067
I'll see you around?
- Yeah.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.800
- Be sure and wax it.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.067
Hi, Alice.
Question--

03:40.100 --> 03:41.267
do you have any idea
how much time we waste here

03:41.367 --> 03:43.800
doing dumb-ass beatbox
competitions?

03:43.900 --> 03:45.067
- She probably doesn't.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.367
Do you even know how many naps
we've taken today?

03:47.467 --> 03:49.267
- I'll tell you, Alice.
Three.

03:49.367 --> 03:50.700
And as far as I'm concerned,
that's one too many.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.767
- Yeah.

03:51.867 --> 03:53.133
- Okay, I don't know
what this is about,

03:53.233 --> 03:54.600
but I do not have time, okay?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.233
I have a very big presentation
coming up now.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.067
- And there it is right there--

03:58.133 --> 04:00.833
everything that's wrong with you
as a so-called "leader."

04:00.933 --> 04:02.500
- Yeah.
- See that? It was in quotes.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.267
- Yeah, and that is why we're
so-called "losers,"

04:05.367 --> 04:07.100
because you
don't lead us good, okay?

04:07.200 --> 04:09.167
I'm an idiot
'cause you're a bozo.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.233
- Deep down, I'm a great man.
- Yeah.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.400
- And a true pimp playboy
for real.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.300
But you're don't inspire
that out of us.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.933
In fact, you're always
yelling at us,

04:16.067 --> 04:18.833
acting like a total bitch.

04:18.933 --> 04:20.167
- Excuse me?

04:20.267 --> 04:22.100
- I was, um...

04:22.200 --> 04:23.567
- "Acting," he said.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.133
"Acting like a bitch."
- I did say "acting."

04:26.233 --> 04:27.633
- Yeah.
- We're not calling you a bitch.

04:27.733 --> 04:30.300
We're saying that things
you do are that of a bitch.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.433
- Right, you have bitch-ish ways
about you.

04:33.533 --> 04:34.800
- Bitch-ishness.
- Yeah, bitchy, bitchy.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.500
- Yeah, just a little bit.
- Yeah.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.733
- Act. Acting.
- Okay, that is it.

04:37.833 --> 04:38.867
Everybody out now.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.433
- That's kind of what
we're talking about.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.233
- Unless you want to be fired.

04:42.333 --> 04:45.733
- No, but how about a transfer
to TAC-Van Nuys?

04:45.833 --> 04:48.400
- Yeah, because the boss there
is a true leader, unlike you.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.533
And he's gonna inspire us
to be great men

04:51.633 --> 04:53.833
and true playboy pimps
for real.

04:53.933 --> 04:56.200
- Okay, so I no longer
have to waste valuable time

04:56.300 --> 04:58.133
on stupid shit like this?

04:58.233 --> 04:59.867
- That's right.
- Consider it done.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.733
You'll start there tomorrow.
- Okay.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.567
Well, now that we're not
working together,

05:04.667 --> 05:07.067
I was hoping that me
and you could--

05:07.100 --> 05:08.767
[door slams]

05:08.867 --> 05:10.900
- Hello?

05:11.067 --> 05:14.067
Are you sure this is it?

05:14.100 --> 05:17.700
[telephone ringing]

05:27.133 --> 05:28.133
- Hello?

05:28.233 --> 05:29.067
- Sell me.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.333
- Uh, okay, sell you what?

05:31.433 --> 05:33.467
- Sell me on each other.

05:33.567 --> 05:37.367
Sell me on why you deserve
to work here.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.833
- Well, hi.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.900
You're here with a guy name
Blake Henderson.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.067
This guy's good.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.167
He could--he could sell sand
to Sandra Bullock,

05:45.267 --> 05:47.533
who probably doesn't need sand.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.533
She's probably got a beach house
in Malibu, right?

05:49.633 --> 05:51.533
- And if you don't hire him,
you're gonna regret it

05:51.633 --> 05:53.167
for your whole life,

05:53.267 --> 05:56.367
and you'll probably end up
dying of regret cancer,

05:56.467 --> 05:58.200
which is a real thing--
my aunt died from it.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.133
She regretted smoking
her whole life.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.567
- Yeah, yeah.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.067
My good friend,

06:02.167 --> 06:04.067
Adam "The Money Boy" DeMamp,
is a sales shark.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.733
He's a hammerhead.

06:05.833 --> 06:09.233
- Oh, no, more like a phone-head
shark, because this dude--

06:09.333 --> 06:11.300
it's basically like he has
a phone attached to his head,

06:11.400 --> 06:13.400
and he's circling
those sales.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.600
But actually,
I want to move the spotlight

06:15.700 --> 06:18.067
over to my dude
Anders Holmvik, okay?

06:18.167 --> 06:19.933
- And I want to move
the spotlight back to me

06:20.067 --> 06:22.067
because I didn't like
that last one.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.333
So let's just do
a couple more about me.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.633
- Okay, yeah,
and I'll get back to you--

06:24.733 --> 06:26.633
- Stop.
I've made my decision.

06:26.733 --> 06:29.300
And, boys, I'm buying
what you're selling.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.600
- All right.

06:30.700 --> 06:34.233
[cheers and applause]

06:35.500 --> 06:36.533
- Yeah.
Right on.

06:43.567 --> 06:44.833
- You've got one week

06:44.933 --> 06:47.400
to prove that you
belong here permanently.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.467
- Congrats, boys.
Welcome to TAC-Van Nuys,

06:49.567 --> 06:52.433
or as JP here
likes to call it...

06:52.533 --> 06:55.267
- The mother[bleep]
Dough Jo.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.467
all: Dough Jo.
Dough Jo. Dough Jo.

06:57.567 --> 07:00.067
- Now, who her wants
a Carl's Jr. sausage, egg,

07:00.133 --> 07:01.267
and cheese biscuit coupon?

07:01.367 --> 07:03.967
[all cheering]

07:04.067 --> 07:05.533
- That's mine!
- I caught one.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.333
- Oh, wow.
Gorgeous photos.

07:07.433 --> 07:08.367
Herb Ritts shoot these?

07:08.467 --> 07:11.100
- No, my boy Juan Carlos
took these.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.900
Crazy talented.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.833
Shot Brooke Burke for the cover
of "Stuff" magazine.

07:14.933 --> 07:17.300
- Wow.
- I love "Stuff" magazine.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
- Hey, whoa.
You can't go in there.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.433
That leads to JP's office.

07:20.533 --> 07:23.333
It's off-limits,
except for VIPs.

07:23.433 --> 07:24.500
- VIPs.
- VIPs.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.800
- And these are gonna be
your offices.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.400
- Wait.
We get our own offices?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.100
- TAC-Van Nuys, baby.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.800
Just call down to Shannon,
the office manager.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.400
Let her know
what decor you prefer,

07:34.500 --> 07:35.633
and she'll make it happen.

07:35.733 --> 07:36.900
- I love decor.

07:37.067 --> 07:39.167
- Yeah!
- All right. Look, my name.

07:39.267 --> 07:42.067
- You'll also find new suits
as well as the hair gel

07:42.133 --> 07:43.300
and essential oils
that JP recommends.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.700
Get changed.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.067
JP's blasting off
a speech in ten.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.867
Be there!
- Okay!

07:47.967 --> 07:49.367
- So here's what we're gonna do.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.067
We're gonna take this week.

07:51.167 --> 07:54.333
We're gonna butt-[bleep] it
until it dumps Monday!

07:54.433 --> 07:56.667
[all cheering]
- [bleep], yes!

07:56.767 --> 07:58.433
- Yes!
- [bleep], yes!

07:58.533 --> 07:59.067
- Yes! Whoo!
- [bleep], yes.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.400
- [bleep], yeah.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.067
- If some old man says
to you, "No,"

08:03.167 --> 08:04.433
because he's broke

08:04.533 --> 08:08.333
because he spent his money
on expensive heart medication,

08:08.433 --> 08:09.900
what does that mean?

08:10.067 --> 08:11.467
all: Yes.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.067
- Because no means...

08:13.167 --> 08:14.667
all: Yes.

08:14.767 --> 08:15.933
- I don't know
what you're waiting for.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.600
Go, go, go!

08:17.700 --> 08:18.600
- Yeah!

08:18.700 --> 08:20.133
- Sell these [bleep] things!

08:20.233 --> 08:21.367
*

08:21.467 --> 08:25.767
- * He's insane

08:25.867 --> 08:28.933
*

08:29.067 --> 08:30.567
- Listen up.

08:30.667 --> 08:31.367
You crushed it.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.467
200 sales.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.767
- Yes!
- Okay!

08:34.867 --> 08:35.333
- Whoo!
- Yeah, that's right, man.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.267
- Van Nuys!

08:37.367 --> 08:40.067
- So here's the big surprise.

08:40.167 --> 08:43.067
I want 200 more sales
by 8:00 tonight.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.067
[all groan]
- What? Is he serious, dude?

08:45.100 --> 08:47.267
I'm, like, exhausted.
Now he wants us to work late?

08:47.367 --> 08:49.333
If you want to go home
and you want to rip farts

08:49.433 --> 08:52.300
and watch "The Dome,"
the door is right there.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.633
But if you want
to be a phone beast

08:54.733 --> 08:56.200
and you want to be rewarded--
that's right, rewarded.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.633
We're gonna have Botox shots
flying around the office,

08:59.733 --> 09:02.600
as well as sushi strippers
for all you boys and girls.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.767
[all cheering]
- Whoa!

09:05.867 --> 09:07.367
- Whoo!
- Okay. All right.

09:07.467 --> 09:09.767
- It's like
"Showdown in Little Tokyo."

09:09.867 --> 09:11.233
- Yes. Yes!
- Yeah. Heck, yeah.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.833
- If you guys get to 200 sales,
400 total for tonight,

09:14.933 --> 09:16.867
you get to wease the juice
with the Wease-Man himself.

09:16.967 --> 09:21.567
- Oh! Oh, Pauly Shore!
Oh, Pauly Shore!

09:21.667 --> 09:23.367
- Encino--
Oh, my God, man.

09:23.467 --> 09:25.500
- Hello, TAC.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.200
Van Nuys guys.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.900
Who's ready
to mother[bleep] party?

09:31.067 --> 09:32.733
[all cheering]

09:32.833 --> 09:34.433
- Me. I am, Pauly.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.433
- Me and Pauly are old friends,
and, uh, he lost a bet.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.133
[laughter]

09:40.233 --> 09:41.067
- This makes us even, JP.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.067
You son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.200
- Well, if you guys
start working the phones

09:45.300 --> 09:48.300
and you start making
those sales, guess what.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.700
I'll get you on TMZ tonight.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.967
- Yes!
- Yeah!

09:52.067 --> 09:53.300
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Okay.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.333
- Yeah.
- Sell, sell, sell.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.067
- 200 more!
- Let's go.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.900
- I wish I would have had
some beers in here

09:59.067 --> 10:00.767
or maybe some sake bombs
or something

10:00.867 --> 10:03.167
or some of that sushi, man,

10:03.267 --> 10:05.067
or one of those hot
little stripper bitches.

10:05.167 --> 10:06.933
- Of course
they're great for kids.

10:07.033 --> 10:09.333
How many do you want? Ten?
They're yours.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.567
- I mean, the real question is,

10:10.667 --> 10:14.867
do you care about the happiness
of your children?

10:14.967 --> 10:16.667
And that's a yes!

10:16.767 --> 10:20.267
Whoo! Sold, baby!

10:20.367 --> 10:21.900
- And just so you know, with
the purchase of this product,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.867
you do have
a three-year warranty.

10:24.967 --> 10:27.233
Excellent.
You have a nice day too.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.400
Hyuh!

10:28.500 --> 10:30.567
Yah.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.367
Kyo-tasha!

10:32.467 --> 10:36.500
- Bam, yeah!
I love it! Whoo!

10:36.600 --> 10:37.767
We be selling.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.633
- I want you to be
Sales Team Six!

10:40.733 --> 10:44.600
I want you to be samurai
telemarketing [bleep] warriors!

10:44.700 --> 10:48.400
I don't care
if your [bleep] mom dies today!

10:48.500 --> 10:50.600
[shoes clapping loudly]
- Okay. Ow, that was loud.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.467
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear.

10:52.567 --> 10:57.367
Sold! Ahhh!
I made a sale, girl.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.667
- You got three kids.
I say you buy three.

10:59.767 --> 11:02.067
Great.
All right, take care.

11:02.133 --> 11:04.467
We got a sale!

11:04.567 --> 11:07.067
- Sir, I'm afraid that's
the best offer I can get you.

11:07.167 --> 11:07.933
You know what?
I'm gonna put you on hold

11:08.067 --> 11:09.867
and let you think about that.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.833
Wait, wait.
Ho, ho.

11:11.933 --> 11:14.067
Ah, yep.
How are you?

11:14.133 --> 11:16.267
- I don't want to let go,
but I have to

11:16.367 --> 11:18.200
'cause I'm addicted to sales
right now.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.867
- You got ten minutes
till judgment day.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.200
Come on, let's move it.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.367
- No.
Actually, hold on.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.633
Yeah.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.500
- God damn.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.967
[blows raspberry]

11:35.067 --> 11:38.067
- Hang up the phones.

11:38.133 --> 11:40.233
Hang 'em up.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.500
[exhales sharply through nose]

11:41.600 --> 11:43.767
Feel good?

11:43.867 --> 11:45.933
- Yeah.
- Are you sore?

11:46.067 --> 11:48.367
'Cause you should be sore.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.900
Because today just butt-[bleep]
you up the ass!

11:51.067 --> 11:53.167
- Butt-[bleep]!

11:53.267 --> 11:56.500
- You're 27 units short
of expectations.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.533
- You kidding me?
- Not good enough!

11:58.633 --> 12:02.167
That means that nobody gets
to wease the juice with Pauly!

12:02.267 --> 12:03.533
- Wha--Well, can we
at least talk to him?

12:03.633 --> 12:05.800
- No!

12:05.900 --> 12:08.133
- Whoa, whoa. JP! JP!

12:08.233 --> 12:10.067
- Well, you heard him.
It's over.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.700
Go home.
- Don't leave me in here!

12:11.800 --> 12:13.100
I'm gonna die!

12:13.200 --> 12:15.333
Ding dong,
the Weasel's [bleep] dead.

12:15.433 --> 12:18.667
- That means we might never
get to party with Pauly Shore

12:18.767 --> 12:20.667
and probably join his crew.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.633
- Yeah, well, you know,
you heard what JP said.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.100
- He said no.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.467
And you know what
that means, right?

12:28.567 --> 12:30.500
- Halt!

12:30.600 --> 12:32.933
What size
are those crystal clappers?

12:33.067 --> 12:34.333
- You're pretty good at that.

12:34.433 --> 12:37.167
- Okay, stripper pole
is secure.

12:37.267 --> 12:39.100
- All right,
hang in there, buddy.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
We're gonna get you out
real soon, okay?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.233
- Pauly, I'm gonna spin off
this bar,

12:43.333 --> 12:45.167
smash into the cage
with my heels,

12:45.267 --> 12:46.833
and free your ass.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.067
All right.
- You ready? Cool.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.833
- Yeah.
- Come on.

12:49.933 --> 12:53.133
- Whoo! Aaah!

12:53.233 --> 12:56.867
- Oh, are you okay, Pauly?
Watch out, Adam!

12:56.967 --> 12:59.300
- Pauly, are you all right?
- Pauly, are you all right?

12:59.400 --> 13:02.633
- That was amazing.
Whoo!

13:02.733 --> 13:04.133
- What the hell? Who did this?
- Yeah, who did this?

13:04.233 --> 13:06.900
- Shut up, Cushing.
I just asked that question.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.500
- Um, we did.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.633
- And why would you ever think
that this would be okay?

13:10.733 --> 13:13.567
- Because...

13:13.667 --> 13:15.933
no means yes?

13:16.067 --> 13:17.700
No?

13:17.800 --> 13:22.267
- That right there is
why I [bleep] love you guys!

13:22.367 --> 13:23.733
You got guts.
- Yeah.

13:23.833 --> 13:24.900
- Congratulations.

13:25.067 --> 13:26.867
You get to party
with Pauly Shore.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.100
- That's cool.
What's he--

13:28.200 --> 13:29.800
Oh, wow.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.467
- Enjoy your night, and tomorrow
come see me in my office.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.067
Bye, Pauly.
- Bye, JP.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.967
- This took balls,
heaps of them.

13:39.067 --> 13:39.967
- Heaps of balls. Ah!

13:40.067 --> 13:43.067
- See you tomorrow, VIPs.
- Yeah!

13:43.167 --> 13:46.133
- * I love my life

13:46.233 --> 13:48.200
*

13:48.300 --> 13:51.967
- * We're like
- * Fresh, fresh, fresh

13:52.067 --> 13:53.300
*

13:53.400 --> 13:54.567
- To Pauly.
- To Pauly.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.167
- To Pauly.
[laughter]

13:57.267 --> 13:59.800
- Ah, breakfast booze,
my favorite.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.600
So your whole office is a sauna?
- That's right.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.400
Nothing better than sitting
in a spa

14:04.500 --> 14:05.800
for seven, eight hours a day--

14:05.900 --> 14:07.067
good for the skin.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.067
- And, uh, the strippers
have been here all night?

14:09.167 --> 14:10.367
- Absolutely.

14:10.467 --> 14:12.367
Oxygenates their vaginas.

14:12.467 --> 14:13.933
They love it.
- Sure.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.233
- Hey.
Hey, how are you?

14:16.333 --> 14:17.900
Ah, it's nice in here.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.667
- I've been watching
you very closely this week.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.200
- I've wanted
you to stare at me.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.467
- And I am very impressed
with what I see,

14:24.567 --> 14:26.967
and we were wondering
if you would like to join us

14:27.067 --> 14:29.233
full-time at TAC-Van Nuys.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.867
- Yes.
- Yes, we would.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.367
Thank you so much.
- Yes. This is cool.

14:32.467 --> 14:34.367
- Oh! Up top! Oh, man. Awesome.
- Great work.

14:34.467 --> 14:37.433
- There are a couple
of, uh, minor details

14:37.533 --> 14:39.100
that we would like
to discuss with you...

14:39.200 --> 14:40.967
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.067
- Alone.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.133
- And the girls have to leave
because of this matter?

14:45.233 --> 14:46.533
- Yes.
Disappear like your fathers.

14:46.633 --> 14:50.133
- Look at her butt.
- Cool. That's awesome.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.400
Butts rule.
- They do. They rock.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.700
- Honestly, JP,
you are such a great leader,

14:53.800 --> 14:55.133
I would run
through a brick wall for you,

14:55.233 --> 14:57.667
which I've actually done before
in my parent's basement.

14:57.767 --> 14:58.900
- Okay, shh.
Just listen.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.867
- Cushing, shut the [bleep] up,
and you just listen!

15:00.967 --> 15:02.533
You just listen!

15:02.633 --> 15:05.467
- You just listen, Cushing.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.333
- I'm sure you may have heard
that we are taking over

15:07.433 --> 15:08.533
the San Bernardino

15:08.633 --> 15:10.767
and Diamond Bar branches
from TAC.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.767
- Yeah, yeah.
I think I've read about that.

15:12.867 --> 15:14.667
- I heard about it.
- Yeah.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.667
- What does that mean,
business-wise?

15:17.767 --> 15:20.567
- It means that that staff is...
[imitates blade cutting]

15:20.667 --> 15:23.733
Axed, and corporate
sends us their business.

15:23.833 --> 15:27.200
[laughing]

15:27.300 --> 15:28.900
- [laughing]
Laugh, laugh.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.900
[all laugh]

15:31.067 --> 15:31.800
- Biz-nass.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.500
- And that's fun because, like,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.200
they don't have jobs
anymore, right?

15:37.300 --> 15:40.667
- My next target is Rancho,

15:40.767 --> 15:43.900
and I cannot wait to see
the look on my ex-wife's face

15:44.067 --> 15:46.800
when I take her down.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.533
- You were married
to Alice?

15:48.633 --> 15:50.900
- Worst nine weeks
of my entire life.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.367
I mean, we were sport-[bleep]
for a while there

15:53.467 --> 15:57.233
because that bitch
likes to ride the ride.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.367
- Yep.
- I always thought that.

15:59.467 --> 16:02.300
- What I need is for you
to go back there

16:02.400 --> 16:04.767
and steal me
the presentation from Alice

16:04.867 --> 16:06.433
before the big meeting today.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.733
She's a pretty good writer
for a chick.

16:09.833 --> 16:13.333
If she bombs it
and I look great,

16:13.433 --> 16:16.533
takeover inevitable.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.067
- Uh, yeah, we're your guys.
- Yeah, we can do that.

16:18.167 --> 16:20.367
- Good. Excellent.

16:20.467 --> 16:23.300
Because if you do not do that,
you are fired.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
- Yeah.
- Duh.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.467
- I think
my stripper fainted.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.800
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
not again.

16:28.900 --> 16:32.367
- You've never had anyone
die here before, right?

16:32.467 --> 16:34.733
- No.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.567
- No means yes. No means yes.
- No means yes.

16:36.667 --> 16:37.733
- Got it.
Let's go.

16:37.833 --> 16:40.800
- Yeah.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.467
- Whoa.
What the hell is that?

16:44.567 --> 16:45.833
- I think that's us.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.800
- Wow. That is really,
really horrible.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.867
- Yeah.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.433
- Well, Waymond
painted that for you guys.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.500
He hasn't been the same
since you left.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.167
Hasn't spoken a word.
- He's tuckered out.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.300
- I mean, I don't know
how he finds time to take a nap.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.633
- What's going on here?

16:59.733 --> 17:01.367
- That's weird.
- The good old days.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.067
- You really like it better
over there?

17:04.100 --> 17:05.067
- I mean, it's different,
you know?

17:05.133 --> 17:08.233
It's intense, you know,
like, agh.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.400
But there's Botox to take care

17:09.500 --> 17:11.400
of the stress wrinkles
and sushi.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
- And it doesn't taste
like Yoshinoya.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.967
- Well, we'd love
to have you back here,

17:15.067 --> 17:17.300
get the Wicky Wild Boys Crew
back together.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.233
Wicky, wicky wild.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.200
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Okay.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.100
- Okay, I know we were never
in a group with Bill

17:23.200 --> 17:25.667
called the Wicky Wild Boys, but
maybe we should put this back.

17:25.767 --> 17:26.933
- Yeah, I know.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.467
I mean, we do this,
those guys get canned.

17:28.567 --> 17:29.700
- Right.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.467
- Well, well, well...

17:31.567 --> 17:32.467
did you boys
get fired already?

17:32.567 --> 17:34.900
That happened faster
than I thought.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.667
- No, it didn't,
'cause we're not.

17:36.767 --> 17:39.833
- Yeah, in fact,
we have a new leader now

17:39.933 --> 17:42.400
who's teaching us
how to be great men.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.533
In fact,
we're amazing men now,

17:43.633 --> 17:46.633
and we're true playboy pimps
for real.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.633
- Well, it's been amazing
not having you here.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.500
In fact, I never realized
how much you weighed us down.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.067
[chuckles]

17:55.167 --> 17:57.667
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting to rock.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.667
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.

18:00.767 --> 18:02.067
Yeah, we're doing it,

18:02.133 --> 18:03.900
'cause she can't talk to us
like that.

18:04.067 --> 18:06.900
You know, she's lucky that she
was married to JP, you know?

18:07.067 --> 18:07.967
How do you let a piece
like that go?

18:08.067 --> 18:09.667
- He's a hot piece of ass,
right?

18:09.767 --> 18:11.067
And you know he's hogged out.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.167
You saw the outline
through the towel.

18:12.267 --> 18:15.067
- Oh, I saw it.
- Dude, he is fully hogging.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.067
- JP, why don't you kick
things off?

18:16.167 --> 18:18.867
- One second, Mel.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.467
Okay, do we have
the flash drive?

18:20.567 --> 18:23.100
- Yeah, we have
the flash drive.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.400
Give her hell.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.400
Or, give them--
give the whole...

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
- Okay.
- Whoo!

18:28.600 --> 18:31.100
JP! Yeah! Van Nuys!

18:31.200 --> 18:33.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Van Nuys in the house.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.633
- All right.

18:34.733 --> 18:37.500
So what we have here is...

18:37.600 --> 18:40.633
Whoa.
[chuckles]

18:40.733 --> 18:43.433
Oh, I don't know
what this is about.

18:43.533 --> 18:44.700
[chuckles]
Jokes.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.133
Oh.
Oh, [bleep].

18:47.233 --> 18:49.300
Oh!
No. Ah, shit.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.533
Shit, [bleep]. [bleep].

18:51.633 --> 18:53.067
Did you do this?

18:53.100 --> 18:54.600
- No, we didn't.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.833
- You did this.

18:55.933 --> 18:59.500
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.300
- Fine!

19:00.400 --> 19:02.300
I put up numbers.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.867
I am Sales Team Six!

19:06.967 --> 19:09.333
I dare you, fire me.
Fire me!

19:09.433 --> 19:10.600
- You're fired.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.067
Cushing will take over
Van Nuys.

19:13.167 --> 19:16.067
- This is unacceptable
on every level.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.133
- I thought it was good.
Good presentation.

19:17.233 --> 19:19.667
- Thanks, everyone.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.533
Great stuff
from almost all of you.

19:21.633 --> 19:24.967
Alice, spectacular presentation,
as usual.

19:25.067 --> 19:28.567
- Thank you so much, Mel,
and I'll see you next quarter.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.833
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:30.933 --> 19:32.400
Oh, you boys sneaking out?

19:32.500 --> 19:33.667
- Huh?
- Hmm?

19:33.767 --> 19:35.300
- I just wanted to take a second

19:35.400 --> 19:36.400
and thank you
for helping me out in there.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.667
- What are you talking about?

19:38.767 --> 19:40.833
- Oh, you thought it
was just a coincidence

19:40.933 --> 19:42.433
that you ran into Cushing

19:42.533 --> 19:44.467
and he convinced you
into a transfer.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.167
- Uh-huh.

19:46.267 --> 19:48.067
- You knew that JP was gonna
ask us to take your flash drive?

19:48.100 --> 19:49.533
- Cushing, my new boyfriend,

19:49.633 --> 19:52.700
gave me the inside scoop
a week ago,

19:52.800 --> 19:53.600
and I took it from there.

19:53.700 --> 19:55.867
- Oh!
- That's good.

19:55.967 --> 19:57.833
- You're banging Cushing too?
- Oh, my gosh.

19:57.933 --> 19:58.967
- Man, I bet he's hogging out
as well.

19:59.067 --> 20:02.500
- Yeah, you are roping
in some good ones, huh?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.467
- Is it huge?
Like, what does it look--

20:04.567 --> 20:05.667
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

20:05.767 --> 20:06.967
- Who's bigger?

20:07.067 --> 20:08.267
- That was an awesome
leadership move.

20:08.367 --> 20:09.267
- Thank you.

20:09.367 --> 20:10.833
- Honestly,
we were wrong about you.

20:10.933 --> 20:12.167
You don't always act
like a bitch.

20:12.267 --> 20:16.300
- Hey, I do not act
like a bitch.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.567
I am a bitch.

20:19.667 --> 20:23.367
A bad, bad bitch, you bitch.

20:23.467 --> 20:24.867
*

20:28.367 --> 20:29.300
*

20:29.400 --> 20:31.200
- Pretty cool
we got our jobs back,

20:31.300 --> 20:33.367
and we finally got time
to smoke some weed on the clock.

20:33.467 --> 20:36.300
- Well, the bitch knows
we're here to help, right?

20:36.400 --> 20:38.200
What?
She calls herself a bitch.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.900
- She did.
- So I can say that.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.867
- Whoa, whoa. You hear that?
[distant slurping]

20:41.967 --> 20:45.000
I think we got another beatboxer
in the office.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.767
- Ders, go in there
and then rap over his flow,

20:47.867 --> 20:49.567
and I'll FaceTime Pauly.

20:49.667 --> 20:50.900
- Yeah, I'll do that, yeah.
- You got his number!

20:51.000 --> 20:51.567
- Yes, I did.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.167
- [moaning]

20:54.267 --> 20:55.667
- Whoa.
- Oh! Oh! Oh, God!

20:55.767 --> 20:57.000
Oh, uh...

20:57.100 --> 20:58.500
[clears throat]
We weren't, uh...

20:58.600 --> 21:01.667
- No, we just thought
we heard somebody eat-boxing.

21:01.767 --> 21:04.333
Eat-boxing.

21:04.433 --> 21:05.100
- Just...

21:07.367 --> 21:08.900
- Nice.

21:14.267 --> 21:15.200
- It's okay.
This happens sometimes.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.200
Her cells are just
too oxygenated.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.433
She'll come back.
She'll be okay.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.833
- She's pretty alive.
- Yeah.

21:20.933 --> 21:22.933
- She's still warm, right?
- Whoo!

21:23.067 --> 21:24.300
I'm excited to work here.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.433
- Yeah.

21:25.533 --> 21:26.600
This is gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Why did it have to be mine?
