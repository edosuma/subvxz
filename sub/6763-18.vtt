02:08.000 --> 02:10.798
So?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.275
Who are you gonna bet
on in the Super Bowl, huh, bro?

02:14.360 --> 02:15.873
What, are you holding out on me?

02:16.360 --> 02:18.078
Me? Never.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.674
Let me see. Come on.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.559
Brandon, dude.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.029
You picked the Knicks?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.428
The Knicks plus eight.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.558
Brandon, don't you know that
betting on basketball is for suckers?

02:31.320 --> 02:32.753
- We'll see.
- All right.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.639
All right, don't come crawling to me
when you lose that shirt of yours.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.392
- What shirt?
- Funny, Walsh.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.357
I can't believe you're
passing up a whole weekend

02:39.520 --> 02:40.509
to be pampered to death.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.989
Yeah, I'm going to get massages
every morning and every night.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.434
- Me too.
- I know.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.478
But it's a mother-daughter thing.
And I just feel like a fifth wheel.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.518
Donna, are you sure your mom
is really, really sick?

02:50.680 --> 02:52.398
Kel, she's not faking it.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.391
Do you think my mom
would bail out on something

02:54.560 --> 02:55.913
that's prepaid, and non-refundable?

02:56.080 --> 02:57.718
Can't you go with somebody else?

02:57.880 --> 02:59.313
Like who?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.834
Look, you guys,
I'm just not into those kind of places.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.560
Andrea, how do you know? You've
never been to a health spa before.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.359
Yeah. The Montecito Spa is supposed
to be the best in California.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.873
And it's totally geared to women.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.155
And it's totally free.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.719
And it's totally luxurious.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.677
And we'll all be together.
It'll be a blast.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.230
I don't know. Getting massages and
beauty tips makes me a little nervous.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.753
Somehow I've never had
that problem.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.319
Don't think of it in terms of vanity.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.311
Think of it more of nurturing,
and relaxation.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.914
Just think the whirlpool
will definitely be good for your legs.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.355
- Well, that's true.
- Come on, Andrea, admit it.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.351
Aren't you just
the tiniest bit curious?

03:30.760 --> 03:34.070
Maybe just a little. I mean, it is free.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.595
And I could write a story about it
in the <i>Blaze,</i>

03:39.920 --> 03:41.558
Okay.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.352
The meat loaf is for dinner tonight,
the <i>Arroz con Pollo</i> is for tomorrow.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.192
Ever hear of takeout?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.634
Jackie, would you tell your friend

03:51.800 --> 03:53.597
that I might just be capable
of taking care

03:53.760 --> 03:55.193
of myself for a few days?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.874
Whatever you say, Jim.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.274
Are you guys almost packed?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.635
Almost. Mom,
can I borrow your new robe?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.030
Nobody takes a robe
to the Montecito.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.713
Everybody just walks around naked?

04:06.440 --> 04:08.670
No. They give you these really comfy
little wraparounds

04:08.840 --> 04:10.512
that are like environmentally perfect.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.954
That's what they tell me.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.394
- See?
- Cool.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.596
- We're gonna go in 15 minutes.
- Okay.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.315
Thank God they're
on speaking terms again.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.516
Well, you know it will end
as soon as Dylan decides

04:21.680 --> 04:23.238
which one he wants to start
dating again.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.073
Let's hope not.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.629
Well, have a great weekend, ladies,

04:27.800 --> 04:30.473
try not to think too hard
about me slaving away back here.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.029
- You're working this weekend?
- No, I've got an audit coming up.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.873
We represent this psychiatrist
who's written this bestseller.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.234
What is it?

04:37.400 --> 04:40.631
It's some pop psychology thing,
you know.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.631
Do you know the name of it?

04:42.800 --> 04:46.110
It's <i>Mid-Life: Now What?</i>

04:46.280 --> 04:48.111
Oh, I read it. It's fabulous.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.157
Every wife should read it.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.268
- Hey, Mom, let's go.
- Excuse me.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.471
Anyway, have a great weekend.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.393
I suppose you'll be working
with Dottie all weekend?

05:02.560 --> 05:06.269
No. I'm going to be working
with Doctor Benjamin Cramer,

05:06.440 --> 05:10.149
but Dottie is my secretary,
and yes, she will be with me.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.595
- Great.
- Honey--

05:13.080 --> 05:17.756
You have got nothing to worry about
which you already know.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.552
Anyway,

05:20.920 --> 05:23.992
I'm much too old
to be having a midlife crisis.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.040
- Hey, Nat, could you do me a favour?
- What's that?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.839
Would you call Duke
and get me some action for tonight?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.994
- Who do you want? How much?
- Give me the Knicks for half.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.957
Wait, wait.
lsn't that a little too steep?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.997
Only if I lose.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.670
Dylan, I'm telling you, it's a party
in the Palisades.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.149
The Pacific Palisades. Come on.
You know how it is there, man?

05:50.320 --> 05:51.833
lf you're not a babe
by the time you're 16,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.194
they ask you to move out of town.

05:53.360 --> 05:58.275
Steve, the last thing I need to do
right now is to meet more girls, man.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.397
Silver, how about it?

06:01.560 --> 06:04.836
I got two tests on Monday,
and a girlfriend at the health spa.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.275
You're a dweeb, you know that?

06:07.440 --> 06:09.908
Hey, Brando, a little party
in the Palisades tonight?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.071
No can do, I'm gonna stay home,
watch the Knicks game.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.993
What's with you guys?
I'm out of here.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.431
This place is so peaceful.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.194
I can feel myself melting
into this couch.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.920
They're gonna have to carry us out
by the time this weekend is over.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.117
You guys, did you see all
the exotic massages they have here?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.998
Listen to this.
They have Jin Shin Do,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.958
watsu and reflexology.
What's Jin Shin Do?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.633
They'll explain it later.
Listen to this,

06:41.800 --> 06:44.837
they got low-impact aerobics,
water aerobics and yoga.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.197
Oh, I always wanted to take yoga,

06:47.360 --> 06:49.510
when it-- It's two hours.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.910
That conflicts with their guided tour
through the arboretum,

06:52.080 --> 06:53.593
- what am I supposed to do?
- Andrea.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.274
Maybe he'll let me take a late class
if I skip breakfast.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.158
- Andrea.
- Maybe they have a early-bird class

06:58.320 --> 07:00.276
- that I could take before 6 a.m.?
- Andrea.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.590
- What?
- Relax.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.478
Well, we're all set.
Now all I have to do

07:04.640 --> 07:06.551
is lose the ten pounds I put
on since Erin was born.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.632
Well, that sounds easier
than losing 15 years.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.479
Jackie?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.949
Babette. Hi.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.717
- You look fantastic.
- You too, thank you.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.359
Babette Lewis, this is Cindy Walsh.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.590
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.159
Babette, this is her daughter,
Brenda.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.514
- Hi.
- And this is Andrea.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.669
- Hi.
- And Donna.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.955
- Hi.
- And you remember Kelly?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.395
Of course I do. Hi.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.518
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, it has.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.478
- Are you here for the weekend?
- Every weekend. I work here.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.278
- For the last two years.
- You're kidding.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.158
No. So if any of you need anything,

07:39.320 --> 07:41.709
or want anything, feel free
to give me a holler.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.435
- What room are you staying in?
- Eight-thirty-two.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.830
You guys have a great view
from up there.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.956
- Good.
- I've gotta go, but I'll give you a call.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.556
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Okay, guys, let's go.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.871
You know, this place is nirvana
to begin with,

07:57.040 --> 07:58.519
but with your mom's friend
working here,

07:58.680 --> 08:00.636
we will definitely be getting
the royal treatment.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.918
Believe me, any treatment Babette
can give you, you don't want.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.638
What do you mean?

08:06.800 --> 08:09.712
Babette used to be
my mom's coke connection.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.398
Hello, Sir Brandon.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.676
Hey, Dad.
Look at this, will you look at this?

08:19.840 --> 08:21.592
Mom must have felt real guilty.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.557
What do you want?
The chicken or the meat loaf?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.029
I'll grab something near the office.
I gotta work all weekend.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.713
With Dottie?

08:27.880 --> 08:29.074
Yes, with Dottie.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.229
Way to go, Dad.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.393
Excuse me, young raging hormones,
may I remind you, I'm a married man?

08:35.559 --> 08:39.599
Hey, hey, you don't have
to explain anything to me, you big stud.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.431
- Good night.
- See you later, big guy.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.440
<i>Casa</i> Walsh. Oh, hey, Mom.
How are you doing?

08:48.600 --> 08:51.398
Fine. We got here.
I mean, we made good time.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.073
- How are you?
- <i>Great,</i>

08:53.240 --> 08:54.798
Listen, honey, is Dad there?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.991
He just ran out the door.
You want me to go get him?

08:57.160 --> 09:00.232
Oh, no, no, it's okay.
What time did he say he'd be back?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.994
Actually, he didn't say.
Maybe you wanna try him at the office.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.790
- <i>He's going to be working all weekend,</i>
- Oh, okay, I'll just try him later.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.075
Cool, talk to you later.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.673
Bye, honey.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.719
What's the matter?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.876
You think they have a bookstore
in this place?

09:18.840 --> 09:20.273
Suppose they have
a chapter here on men

09:20.440 --> 09:22.590
who have affairs
with their secretaries?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.239
Let me guess.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.153
Early 30s and a knockout.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.959
More like late 20s and a knockout.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.829
I know the type. I was the type.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.394
How do I compete with that?

09:42.560 --> 09:45.393
You can't and I'm sure Jim
doesn't expect you to.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.152
He's going to be alone
with her all weekend

09:47.320 --> 09:48.799
while I'm having cellulite treatments.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.155
Listen, if you weren't jealous
every once in a while,

09:51.320 --> 09:52.912
you wouldn't be in love.

09:53.080 --> 09:58.200
Jim is a good man and you guys have
a great marriage. Don't you?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.311
What kind of man goes
to Amsterdam on business

10:08.480 --> 10:10.118
without bringing back any receipts?

10:10.280 --> 10:11.713
The man who doesn't want anyone
to know

10:11.880 --> 10:13.108
what he was doing in Amsterdam.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.232
Yeah.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.030
What do you say we double-check
the office expenses?

10:20.760 --> 10:22.557
Okay.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.990
Okay. There's $2795.75
for the portable computer,

10:28.160 --> 10:33.837
$391 .12 for the Dictaphone,
$1587 for the laser printer,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.470
$975.25 for the file cabinet.

10:37.640 --> 10:42.475
That's 5749.12
amortized over five years

10:42.640 --> 10:48.237
which should leave us a deduction
of 1148.82.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.515
That's amazing.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.477
Well, 20 percent is pretty standard.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.359
I mean, the way you did
those computations in your head.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.317
I can't even balance my chequebook.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.754
You're really a brilliant man,
Mr. Walsh.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.956
You should've seen me
when I was in my prime.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.271
As far as I can tell,
you still are in your prime.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.072
Hi, what are you guys doing?

11:15.240 --> 11:17.470
Oh, just a little warm-up
before we go get beautified.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.110
- But we're supposed to be inside.
- Andrea.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.318
Right. I know.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.311
Relax.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.594
Go.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.158
Come on, baby.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.431
This is really weird.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.556
I can't believe I'm taking a bath
in mud.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.154
It is so gooey. It feels like there's hay
in it or something.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.356
It's not hay, it's herbs.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.310
- What kind of herbs?
- The kind horses like to eat.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.550
This is supposed to draw
all the toxins out of the skin

12:15.720 --> 12:17.631
and restore its natural supple tone.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.713
- Well, I cannot move in this goop.
- I don't know.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.270
Rolling around in this slop
just doesn't seem kosher.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.874
Can we all be quiet and relaxed,
please?

12:32.360 --> 12:33.588
Morning, Nathaniel.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.830
Mr. Duke?
You don't waste any time.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.195
A man's gotta earn a living,
and get something good to eat.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.749
Well, you came to the right place.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.795
Remind me not to bet
on a shrine game again.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.996
Why don't you give it to your prodigy?
He's the winner.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.592
Thank you, sir. But why don't you
just hold on to that and we'll roll it over.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.875
- Yeah?
- Why not?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.349
I'm playing with your money now,
aren't I?

12:58.480 --> 13:01.040
Breakfast is served, sir.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.997
Yeah.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.038
Will you stop
with that song already?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.834
Man, you must really be caught
between a rock and a hard place.

13:10.000 --> 13:10.989
It's driving me crazy.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.550
It's like I try to picture
myself with Brenda, I see Kelly.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.597
I try to picture myself with Kelly,
I see Brenda.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.390
- It's a problem.
- Yeah.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.790
Listen, let me give you one piece
of advice.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.279
Stop playing that song

13:23.440 --> 13:25.908
or Nat's gonna hurt you.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.189
That was invigorating.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.920
- Oh, I'm freezing.
- Well, the cold water closes the pores.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.354
My pores are freezing.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.431
Okay, everybody all set?

13:44.600 --> 13:46.511
Lisanne will take care of you two.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.511
And you two are with me.

13:48.680 --> 13:52.992
And don't worry. We're going to do
a lot of work on your problem areas.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.151
Problem areas?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.070
So where are you girls from?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.878
Beverly Hills.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.268
Oh, you girls go to college?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.509
High school.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.477
High school?

14:19.640 --> 14:22.996
They didn't make them like you
when I was in high school, thank God.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.197
Not sure it would've made a difference.
I wasn't very popular anyway.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.952
It's just as well.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.237
Men, who needs them?
You know what I mean?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.118
My friend Mandy was going
with this married man

14:33.280 --> 14:34.349
for almost three months.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.597
A rich guy, in Beverly Hills.

14:36.760 --> 14:40.309
He was crazy in love with her,
bought her gifts, sent her flowers,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.675
until her best friend Sheila
got her claws in him.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.149
Can you imagine that?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.993
I mean, two best friends fighting
over the same guy?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.912
What a crazy thing to do, huh?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.838
My legs feel like they're made out
of rubber.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.149
Are you as vegged out as I am?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.197
Yeah, I'm a radish.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.510
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

15:08.680 --> 15:11.114
Yeah, if you're thinking
of my thunder-thighs.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.997
Kelly, that masseuse
was an airhead.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.798
Although what she said
about her best friends

15:15.960 --> 15:17.951
fighting over the same guy,
that kind of got to me.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.236
Yeah. I wish Gina
hadn't said anything either

15:20.400 --> 15:22.834
but one thing I can say for her.
She might have a big mouth,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.513
but she's got great hands.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.272
Well, let's go see how the others
are doing.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.078
Brenda, wait.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.432
Do you think I have problem areas?

15:31.360 --> 15:32.873
No, I'm serious.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.833
Kelly, no. You're crazy.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.720
That song once again.
Oh, if it's what he wants...

15:59.520 --> 16:02.671
Don't look at me, Nat,
I didn't do it, I swear.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.758
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.553
What's with you anyway?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.358
I don't know, Nat. I just--

16:12.880 --> 16:16.759
Nat, I'm kind of having girl problems,
to the extreme.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.480
I kind of figured that out.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.392
So who are you on the outs with?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.039
Kelly or Brenda?

16:25.200 --> 16:29.113
Kelly and Brenda. I mean it depends
what time of day it is, I swear.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.395
Cheer up.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.437
It's not like you're gonna
get married next week.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.033
Yeah.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.430
I'll get you another cup of coffee.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.711
Brenda, I'm home.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.356
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.988
- Oh, my girls, how are you?
- Pick me up, Daddy, pick me up.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.469
Here, come here, I gotcha.
Up you go.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.991
Where's your mother?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.438
Spending my money, isn't she?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.113
Where were you?

17:04.280 --> 17:06.748
Oh, I been away, darling, sorry.
Hey, hey, Kevin.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.752
Kyle, now, hey, what have you guys
done to this room?

17:09.920 --> 17:10.909
Kevin. Kyle.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.913
I had an important tax report
laying right there on that table.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.512
Brenda!

17:15.680 --> 17:18.512
Stop that, both of you. You get
over there. You go to your room.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.113
- Leave me alone.
- There you are,

17:20.280 --> 17:22.191
I didn't hear you come in.

17:22.359 --> 17:25.670
I've been trying to decide
on wallpaper for the nursery.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.400
What do you think?
Bunnies or bears?

17:35.680 --> 17:38.194
Bunnies or bears?

17:47.320 --> 17:48.514
Here you go.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.358
Thanks.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.397
I cannot believe you ordered
two whole lunches

18:05.560 --> 18:08.632
at 392 calories apiece.
That is 784 calories.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.633
Well, mud baths make me hungry.
Are you going to eat that avocado?

18:11.800 --> 18:12.789
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.598
She's like a bottomless pit.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.399
How do you eat so much
and stay so thin? It's disgusting.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.312
Oh, I ate a whole loaf of bread once.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.872
Now, that's disgusting.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.672
Donna, are you sure
you don't have bulimia or something?

18:25.840 --> 18:28.593
I have a fast metabolism, gee.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.872
Andrea, do you think Donna
has an eating disorder?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.837
I don't know.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.991
Andrea, you're starting
to get the hang of this place.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.035
According to this, 66 percent of men

18:41.200 --> 18:43.111
over the age of 42
have had fantasies

18:43.280 --> 18:46.033
of leaving their wife
to run off with a younger woman.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.111
Big surprise.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.509
Okay, Dr. Kramer says:

18:49.680 --> 18:51.636
"Only expose these feelings
to your wife

18:51.800 --> 18:53.836
if you are willing
to accept the consequences

18:54.000 --> 18:55.638
which may be severe and painful.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.350
Remain in control. Don't panic.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.748
These fantasies are normal.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.512
They are just fantasies.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.752
Unless you make them a reality."

19:05.560 --> 19:07.357
I wonder if they have
a phone out here.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.549
Jim Walsh's office.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.559
Yes, is he in?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.798
I'm sorry, but he's behind closed doors,
may I take a message?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.878
Well, just tell him
that his wife called.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.834
Cindy. Hi, I'm sorry,
I didn't recognise your voice.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.149
<i>How's the spa?</i>

19:25.320 --> 19:27.151
It's great.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.355
How's my husband?

19:28.520 --> 19:30.112
Great. Really great.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.269
Great.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.112
Would you like for me
to interrupt him?

19:33.280 --> 19:36.033
No, it's not important.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.430
I'm sure you're taking good care
of him.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.874
I'm doing my best.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.953
Great.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.429
The problem's--

19:47.600 --> 19:49.955
Knock, knock, gentlemen.
It's lunchtime.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.155
Oh, thank you, Dottie.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.278
Cindy called about 20 minutes ago,
but she said not to disturb you.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.475
ls she okay?

19:55.640 --> 19:58.234
Yeah, she was checking up on you.
Making sure you're being a good boy.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.075
Thai noodles and shrimp

20:00.240 --> 20:03.676
and my own personal favourite,
sweet-and-sour baby lamb.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.831
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.755
How do you concentrate
around here?

20:19.480 --> 20:20.959
Hey, I'm a married man.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.235
Well, so was I.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.069
Can I ask you a question?

20:29.560 --> 20:30.549
lf you'd like to.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.155
- Forget it.
- Okay.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.398
You're right.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.629
I can't concentrate.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.714
I think about her all the time.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.951
It's driving me crazy.
I don't know what to do.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.512
I mean, I love my wife.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.875
She's a terrific lady.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.073
I can't even imagine life without her,

20:52.440 --> 20:55.000
but hey, I'm only human, you know?

20:56.120 --> 20:58.475
And you see what my secretary
is like.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.349
Just between you and me,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.956
half the time
I think she's coming on to me.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.917
Which I know, it's crazy,
I know, I know, I know.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.117
But then I think,

21:13.560 --> 21:14.959
what if she is coming on to me?

21:15.440 --> 21:19.479
And then I get so guilty
for thinking about her at all.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.914
You know what the worst part is?

21:21.360 --> 21:24.716
She is by far and away
the best damn secretary I've ever had.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.029
I see.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.354
So, what am I going to do, doc?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.750
Well, maybe you'd like to make
an appointment with my office,

21:30.920 --> 21:32.876
and we could explore
your feelings further.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.235
Okay.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.435
As long as you were here--

21:37.600 --> 21:41.275
ln the meantime, why don't you
take a copy of my book

21:43.640 --> 21:47.918
and try the noodles,
they're delicious.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.916
Do you remember that 4th of July
party we had at Corey Jessup's ranch?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.514
Part of it.
I was pretty stoned that night.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.432
Everybody was stoned that night.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.989
Oh, and Corey had the most incredible
display of fireworks

22:03.160 --> 22:04.593
that just went on for hours.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.478
What I remember is falling asleep
on the couch

22:06.640 --> 22:08.676
and not waking up till August.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.270
When Corey said he
was taking you out for French food

22:11.440 --> 22:13.192
it meant bring along your passport.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.352
You mean he'd fly you to France?

22:16.520 --> 22:18.556
Ten, 15 people at a time
on his Lear jet.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.995
- No.
- And I'm not sure which was higher,

22:21.160 --> 22:22.718
the plane or the passengers.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.878
We had some good times, huh?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.912
Yeah, we did.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.358
And more bad times
than I care to remember.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.828
Yeah.

22:35.760 --> 22:39.150
Well, I have to confess, every now
and then, I still do an occasional toot

22:39.320 --> 22:41.038
but only on special occasions.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.314
Not me. I'm completely clean.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.232
I'm not Jackie Taylor anymore.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.913
I'm Mrs. Mel Silver.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.390
I just had a new baby
and I feel better than I have in years.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.754
That's great, Jackie.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.830
Well, listen, I better get going
before they realise that I'm gone.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.149
Thanks for the fruit basket.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.673
Oh, you're welcome.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.229
- And it was nice talking to you, Cindy.
- You too, Babette.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.470
Listen, maybe we can all get together
for a drink later.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.755
- That'd be fun.
- Great.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.717
Great, I'll give you a call. Bye.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.313
See you.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.073
Oh, boy--

23:15.240 --> 23:16.958
Sounds like some wild times.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.471
Yeah, they were.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.638
Do you remember
the first time we met?

23:22.760 --> 23:24.955
You caught me doing lines
in the bathroom?

23:25.720 --> 23:27.995
Yes. I remember.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.869
- I'm so embarrassed now I could die.
- Why?

23:32.040 --> 23:33.871
I mean, you have changed
so much since then.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.634
I mean, you're a completely
different person.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.918
I really admire you for that.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.232
Thank you.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.708
Honestly, Kelly, don't you think
you're jumping to conclusions?

23:48.880 --> 23:53.954
No, I mean, why else would
she bring up a fruit basket?

23:54.120 --> 23:55.758
Because she was trying
to be friendly?

23:55.920 --> 23:57.717
I don't buy it.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.749
But how do you know Babette
is still a dealer?

24:00.920 --> 24:02.148
It's just a vibe I get.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.389
Well, even is she is,

24:03.560 --> 24:05.676
that doesn't mean Jackie's
gonna get high again, does it?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.717
Look, Kelly,
if this is really bothering you,

24:09.880 --> 24:12.599
you should definitely talk
to your mother about it,

24:13.440 --> 24:15.237
but can we do it after our facials?

24:15.760 --> 24:18.433
- Why don't you just go without me?
- Kelly.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.431
Okay, look, I'll meet you in the
locker room in 10 minutes, okay?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.033
Okay.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.068
Hi, guys.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.753
What smells?

24:31.920 --> 24:33.911
Seaweed body wraps.

24:34.080 --> 24:38.232
- Sounds slimy.
- I feel like a piece of sushi.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.508
Actually, I've never had sushi, but I
imagine this is what sushi feels like.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.556
So anyway, my friend Mandy had
been going out with this married man

24:48.720 --> 24:51.632
for like almost three months
until her best friend Sheila

24:51.800 --> 24:53.358
got her claws in him.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.159
Anyway, he was this big-time
Beverly Hills oral surgeon

24:56.320 --> 24:59.437
with a new wife and a new baby.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.957
Dr. Silver.
Mel Silver. You ever hear of him?

25:04.440 --> 25:06.874
And so, he and she have been
going out for like, you know,

25:07.040 --> 25:10.032
two, three months on the sly,
and you just know a guy

25:10.200 --> 25:14.955
like that's gonna do the same thing
again and again and again.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.470
Davey, me boy. Davey, me boy.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.756
You can't be coy
with Davey me boy.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.558
Do you think
I can get a large pot of coffee?

25:33.720 --> 25:36.109
Sure you could, young Davey.
But not from me, laddie.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.952
My shift is over and I'm leaving.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.918
Nadine, would you bring
this young man a pot of coffee?

25:41.080 --> 25:43.275
- Later, bro.
- Thanks, man.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.033
Studying?

25:48.200 --> 25:50.350
No, I was just reading.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.112
For fun?

25:52.280 --> 25:53.952
Strange, but true.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.474
You don't look so good, Silver.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.676
Yeah, well, I didn't get
all my beauty sleep.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.193
Young Erin was up crying all night.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.033
- ls she sick?
- No. She misses her mama.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.394
What about her dada?

26:03.920 --> 26:05.478
Last night was the poker game.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.474
How convenient.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.517
Yeah, well, he deserves a night off
for a change.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.159
He's one of those workaholics.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.594
- Really?
- Yup.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.194
Mel's theory is: You spend
the long hours to make the big bucks

26:15.360 --> 26:17.749
so you can spoil all the women
in your life.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.831
Why do you think he and Kelly
get along so well?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.115
Honey, I'm home.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.872
I'm in here, babe.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.395
- Did you have a good day?
- I did.

26:59.560 --> 27:02.552
Until a nasty clerk
at Saks tore up my credit card.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.030
She insisted we were a couple
of months late paying the bill.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.236
How could she say something
like that?

27:08.400 --> 27:12.109
Well, Kel, I need to talk to you
about something.

27:12.280 --> 27:14.748
- Okay, but first, close your eyes.
- Kelly.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.751
Come on. Close them.
Pretty please.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.599
Ta-da.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.073
lsn't it divine?
I bought it for our next vacation.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.478
What vacation?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.837
Well, President's Day is coming up,
and since we always go somewhere,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.752
I told Donna and David
we'd go skiing with them

27:33.920 --> 27:35.319
in St. Moritz for the weekend.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.869
I don't really think
that's a very good idea.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.594
Oh, please?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.751
Not this year.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.155
Come on, baby,
don't look at me like that, pl-- Loo--

27:47.320 --> 27:49.231
Here. We were just
in Paris a month ago.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.311
Now, can't we just stay home,
you know?

27:51.480 --> 27:52.595
Quietly for the weekend,

27:52.760 --> 27:55.354
just you and I in our little love nest,
what do you think?

27:55.520 --> 27:59.752
Dylan, why would we stay here
when we can go to Hawaii?

28:00.760 --> 28:02.557
That's not a good idea, Kel.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.349
- Why not?
- We're broke.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.276
- What'd you say?
- There's no more money in the bank.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.829
How did that happen?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.191
We spent it all.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.513
Oh, my God. Dylan, oh, my God.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.069
How are we gonna live?
What are we gonna do?

28:25.240 --> 28:28.152
Kel, it's gonna be okay.
I mean, don't get upset.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.038
How can you say that?
We have no money.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.158
Look, Kel, I knew
you were gonna be upset,

28:33.320 --> 28:35.709
I knew it, so I took it upon myself
to go out

28:35.880 --> 28:38.758
and get you a little something
to make you feel better.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.355
Oh, Dylan,

28:42.520 --> 28:44.909
you've gotta be the sweetest little thing
in the whole world.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.310
Yeah, do you like it?

28:47.480 --> 28:48.959
I love it.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.109
It's an emerald.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.669
That's Brenda Walsh's birthstone.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.998
You're still carrying a torch for her,
aren't you?

29:10.760 --> 29:12.034
Nat, Nat,

29:12.200 --> 29:13.235
how much do I owe you?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.518
I don't know. I'll put it on your tab.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.513
No, no, no, no tabs, man.
I'm gonna pay cash.

29:26.960 --> 29:27.949
I'm sorry I'm late, Bren.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.553
Did you get a whiff
of Donna and Andrea

29:29.720 --> 29:30.755
in their sea-scum body wraps?

29:30.920 --> 29:34.674
I strongly suggest you don't stand
downwind from them for a few days.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.311
What's the matter?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.396
Kelly, you know the masseuse
with the big mouth?

29:41.760 --> 29:42.829
Yeah.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.673
Well, I was in there and she was
talking about her friend Mandy again.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.354
You know, the one who was having
an affair with a married man?

29:50.040 --> 29:52.315
Bren, you said yourself
the girl is an airhead.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.391
Dylan's not gonna get in the way
of our friendship.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.393
- Kelly, let me finish.
- Sorry.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.716
This time she said who
the married man was.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.189
Well, who is it?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.116
- It's Mel.
- What?

30:06.080 --> 30:09.834
"Dr. Mel Silver.
Oral surgeon from Beverly Hills."

30:10.360 --> 30:12.749
Look, I don't know if it's true
but that's what she said.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.389
This can't be happening.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.993
This has gotta be a mistake.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.391
- Hello?
- Hi, David, it's me.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.279
I was talking about you with Dylan
down at the Peach Pit. How's it going?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.192
Not so good. ls your dad there?

30:38.360 --> 30:40.271
No, I haven't seen him.
Why, what's up?

30:40.440 --> 30:42.829
Hopefully nothing.
Did you talk to him this morning?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.752
Well, no, he left for work
before I got up.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.319
Did you see him last night?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.069
Kelly, what's wrong?

30:49.240 --> 30:51.959
Listen, just answer the question,
I will tell you in a minute, okay?

30:52.640 --> 30:54.358
Well, yeah, I saw him.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.239
He was in a good mood.
We played with Erin, and then--

30:57.400 --> 30:58.469
He left for his poker game.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.278
So you don't know
if he came home last night?

31:00.760 --> 31:01.829
I'm sure he did.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.319
But you don't know for sure.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.789
Well, no, I didn't do a bed check
if that's what you mean.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.669
Listen, do me a favour, ask Rosa
if she's seen him yet today.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.032
- That was like pulling teeth.
- Well, his dad is a dentist.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.872
What'd she say?

31:20.560 --> 31:22.471
He didn't come home last night.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.914
Or the night before.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.915
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, how you doing, Mr. Walsh?

31:37.080 --> 31:38.195
Hi, guys. How are you doing?

31:38.360 --> 31:40.237
Good, good, we just came by
to grab a little food

31:40.400 --> 31:42.868
before we go
to the Stallone movie preview.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.395
Sounds like a plan.
Have a good time.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.152
Hey, Mr. Walsh,
what book are you reading?

31:47.800 --> 31:49.119
Book?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.952
Oh, you mean this book?

31:51.320 --> 31:52.958
Oh, no, I'm not really reading it.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.833
One of my clients wrote it.
That's the only reason I have it.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.873
Any good?

31:58.440 --> 32:00.431
Well, like I said,
I'm not really reading it.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.160
I'm just sort of skimming it.
That's all.

32:03.680 --> 32:04.669
What's it called?

32:05.520 --> 32:06.509
Why do you want to know?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.472
Dad? What's the big deal?

32:10.280 --> 32:13.317
It's called...

32:13.680 --> 32:15.796
<i>,,,Mid-Life: Now What?</i>
lf you make one crack

32:15.960 --> 32:19.316
- I'm giving the Mustang to Brenda.
- I didn't say anything, not a word.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.438
Enjoy the movie.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.394
So how was work today?

32:37.720 --> 32:40.678
- Cher comes here?
- She's a regular.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.558
So is Michelle Phillips
and Loni Anderson.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.915
ln other words if we make
these weekends part of our lives,

32:45.080 --> 32:48.595
we too can end up looking glamorous
and eternally youthful.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.512
Well, sweetheart,
I don't think I'd go that far.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.238
Fifteen years.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.719
Hi, sweetie. You wanna join us?

32:53.880 --> 32:56.758
- No, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure, is everything okay?

32:57.240 --> 32:58.593
Yeah.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.077
Excuse me.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.639
Oh, beautiful night.

33:12.600 --> 33:16.115
You know, I am glad
that you pulled me out of there.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.713
This was to be
a mother-daughter weekend

33:17.880 --> 33:21.270
and I feel like we haven't spent
any time together. I miss you.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.836
You were drinking.

33:24.160 --> 33:27.038
- ls that why we're out here?
- No.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.792
Because I'm fine.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.952
I had a little sip of white wine
and that's my limit,

33:32.120 --> 33:34.395
so you don't have
to worry about your old mom.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.313
Does Babette still do coke?

33:38.480 --> 33:41.313
She says she still dabbles
every now and then.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.119
- On special occasions.
- Do you dabble?

33:44.600 --> 33:45.589
Kelly.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.598
Mom, just tell me the truth, please.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.716
No. You know I don't.
Now, what is this about?

33:51.160 --> 33:53.549
I have something to tell you,

33:53.880 --> 33:55.359
and if you
were ever gonna start again,

33:55.520 --> 33:58.353
this would be the thing
that might push you over the edge.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.228
Honey, what's wrong?

34:03.480 --> 34:05.471
Let's go sit down.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.993
All right.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.833
I don't know how to say it.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.638
Well, just say it.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.995
It's about Mel.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.838
Listen, I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

34:55.320 --> 34:58.357
Well, contemplating
a midnight swim?

34:58.520 --> 35:00.431
Make that 1 a.m.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.794
You're kidding.

35:01.960 --> 35:04.428
I guess I'd better get up to my room.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.151
Hey, what's wrong?

35:07.320 --> 35:08.435
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.156
I got some bad news from home.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.072
What happened?

35:13.640 --> 35:15.358
Oh, God.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.878
It's such a cliche.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.555
Come on, you can trust me.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.351
I found out my husband
is having an affair.

35:25.680 --> 35:26.874
Oh, Jackie.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.438
And you with the new baby.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.193
I'm so sorry. I really am.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.954
We weren't even married a year.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.752
I should've seen it coming.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.957
I mean, he constantly cheated
on his ex.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.518
He was always with a
dental assistant or a hygienist.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.640
He swore he'd changed.

35:53.400 --> 35:56.039
He swore with me he'd be different.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.429
How could I have been so naive?

36:00.840 --> 36:02.990
Don't beat yourself up, Jackie.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.390
None of this was your fault.
Not one bit of it.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.074
Now, I have to figure out what to do
with my life.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.068
May I make a suggestion?

36:11.240 --> 36:13.879
Don't make any major decisions
in a depressed state of mind.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.114
- Did you learn that in a fortune cookie?
- Come on,

36:17.280 --> 36:19.669
you look like you could use
a little pick-me-up.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.195
I know just the place to get it.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.274
Come on.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.833
Mom.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.714
Hi, honey. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.678
It's a quarter to 2.
Where have you been?

36:45.240 --> 36:46.832
Well--

36:47.920 --> 36:49.876
I couldn't sleep,

36:50.400 --> 36:54.552
so I went down
to the pool to think things out,

36:54.720 --> 36:56.119
and I ran into Babette.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.437
And I ended up in her room
with a half a gram of cocaine.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.514
Oh, Mom.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.877
It was tempting.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.598
It was really tempting.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.353
But--

37:11.800 --> 37:14.473
That's not the way I'm gonna deal
with this.

37:15.240 --> 37:18.437
That's not the way I'm gonna deal
with anything ever again.

37:19.080 --> 37:23.073
So I thanked her and I left.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.555
I'm so proud of you.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.756
Yeah, me too.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.239
- You know what?
- What?

37:33.200 --> 37:35.589
Tonight I realised...

37:36.760 --> 37:39.991
...that no matter what
the future brings...

37:40.880 --> 37:43.235
...l'm glad I met Mel.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.956
Because look what I got out of it.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.759
A beautiful baby.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.677
What more could a girl
from Ohio ask for?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.279
What's gonna happen?

37:58.480 --> 38:00.436
I don't know.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.714
I have to talk to Mel, that's for sure.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.436
Maybe we can work through this,

38:09.600 --> 38:13.639
maybe we can't,
we'll just have to see.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.948
Why do men cheat?

38:19.120 --> 38:21.714
Why isn't one woman ever enough?

38:21.960 --> 38:24.030
I don't know.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.716
Maybe it's genetic.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.272
Mr. Walsh?

38:39.840 --> 38:41.432
Dottie.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.155
Hi, I know I wasn't supposed
to be here until 10,

38:45.320 --> 38:48.118
but I've been thinking about you
since I woke up this morning,

38:48.280 --> 38:50.510
and, well, we need to talk.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.559
Okay.

38:53.280 --> 38:56.317
I don't know where to begin,
it's so awkward.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.118
No.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.475
It's okay.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.230
Okay, then I'll just come out
and say it.

39:04.680 --> 39:07.513
Maybe it's because your wife's
out of town...

39:08.840 --> 39:10.751
...or because we've been working
so closely together

39:10.920 --> 39:12.797
these last few weeks,

39:13.400 --> 39:15.072
but you have to be the most brilliant

39:15.240 --> 39:18.357
and compassionate man
I've ever met.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.039
And I don't care how old you are...

39:22.760 --> 39:25.558
...l find you incredibly sexy,

39:25.720 --> 39:27.950
and I wanna make love to you
in the worst way

39:28.360 --> 39:30.999
right here, right now.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.476
Dottie, please,
we shouldn't be doing this.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.313
I'm a happily married man.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.873
Dottie, please.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.395
You know I love Cindy.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.108
Oh, my God.
This is like a fantasy come true.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.231
Of course, it's a fantasy,
you old horn dog.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.152
Haven't you finished reading
that book yet?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.799
Mr. Walsh?

40:03.960 --> 40:05.757
Mr. Walsh?

40:05.920 --> 40:06.909
Dottie.

40:07.080 --> 40:11.915
Hi, I know I wasn't supposed
to be here until 10,

40:12.280 --> 40:14.077
but I've been thinking about you
all morning

40:14.920 --> 40:16.399
and, well, we need to talk.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.353
Okay.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.955
I don't know where to begin,
it's so awkward.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.469
Awkward?

40:23.720 --> 40:25.312
Okay, then, I'll just come out
and say it.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.675
Dottie, we shouldn't be doing this.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.110
I think you better find yourself
a new secretary.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.549
What?

40:31.720 --> 40:34.280
My boyfriend and I are moving back
to Florida next week.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.475
Boyfriend?

40:35.640 --> 40:37.631
He got down on his knees
and proposed last night.

40:37.800 --> 40:38.949
We're getting married.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.475
Congratulations.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.638
You guys, look what I have here.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.594
Oh, I love free samples.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.194
Now, the pink caps are for
normal to dry skin. Here, try this one.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.669
Andrea, I think you have a year's
supply for each of us there.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.513
Well, it's important
to be pH balanced.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.514
- Mom, who was on the phone?
- That was just your father.

41:10.680 --> 41:11.954
He called to say he loved me.

41:13.400 --> 41:17.075
Well, after 20 years it's nice to know
that he still cares.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.629
Need any help?

41:20.800 --> 41:21.915
No, I'm all through.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.516
How are you doing?
Are you going to be all right?

41:25.720 --> 41:26.994
I think so.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.752
I know what I have to do.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.956
And it's not going to be easy

41:31.320 --> 41:34.232
but I'm prepared to deal
with whatever comes.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.917
Oh, Jackie,
I just feel like such a fool.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.594
I mean, here I've been suspicious
of Jim all weekend

41:41.840 --> 41:43.796
and now you have to deal
with the real thing.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.396
That would look good on you.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.393
What about something in red?
It's a fabulous colour for you.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.869
I guess I'm just not
in a shopping mood today.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.076
Look, Kelly, I know you're worried
about your mom,

41:58.240 --> 42:00.231
but she's a strong woman,
you know that, don't you?

42:00.400 --> 42:01.389
Yeah, I do.

42:02.960 --> 42:06.236
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.114
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.350
I don't understand why you're rooting
against Minnesota.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.431
I'm not. I just don't want them
to beat the spread.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.552
Oh, no. God forbid.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.076
Dylan, maybe if you had
a little more interest in sports,

42:18.240 --> 42:20.913
you wouldn't have spent all weekend
worrying about your girl problems.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.594
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.988
Hey, if that's Brenda and Kelly,

42:25.160 --> 42:28.277
- tell them to stop over.
- Yeah?

42:28.440 --> 42:30.715
How much money you got
on this game?

42:30.960 --> 42:31.949
What?

42:33.720 --> 42:34.709
Turn on Channel 6.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.154
There's under a minute left.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.514
Turn it on.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.231
