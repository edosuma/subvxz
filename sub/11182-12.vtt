WEBVTT

00:07.482 --> 00:11.793
in the sky

00:18.068 --> 00:23.620
a piece of the pie

00:23.655 --> 00:26.241
in the kitchen

00:26.275 --> 00:28.896
on the grill

00:34.103 --> 00:36.689
in the big leagues

00:39.275 --> 00:41.758
it's you and me, baby

00:41.793 --> 00:43.482
with that

00:49.344 --> 00:53.758
in the sky

00:59.862 --> 01:04.206
a piece of the pie

01:22.344 --> 01:24.517
-You almost done,
Miss Jefferson?
-Oh!

01:24.551 --> 01:26.344
Florence, you almost
saw your present.

01:26.379 --> 01:30.689
Oh, that's okay.
I already saw it last week
when I was cleaning.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.379
What were you doing
cleaning inside a hat box?

01:33.413 --> 01:34.862
Dusting my new hat.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.965
Now you won't have
any surprises
Christmas morning.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.034
Sure I will,
if you all give me
a new coat to go with it.

01:44.068 --> 01:47.793
Actually, George suggested
that we get you
a new dust mop.

01:47.827 --> 01:49.034
Oh, no.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.482
The hat's plenty.

01:51.517 --> 01:54.103
Hey, I never saw this before.

01:54.137 --> 01:57.965
Oh, that's George's present.
It's cashmere.
Do you think he'll like it?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
He'll love it. The label says
"dry clean only".

02:02.586 --> 02:04.517
Hey, Weezy, guess what.

02:04.551 --> 02:06.000
Oh, quick, Florence, hide it.

02:06.034 --> 02:08.758
Hey, Florence,
quit crumbling up
my cashmere sweater.

02:10.586 --> 02:13.551
Great. Now nobody's gonna be
surprised Christmas morning.

02:13.586 --> 02:16.448
Wrong, Weez.
You're gonna be surprised.
I got a real surprise for you.

02:16.482 --> 02:18.931
-You'll never guess
who I saw today.
-Who?

02:18.965 --> 02:21.034
Well, I'll give you a hint.
Who have I always
looked up to?

02:21.068 --> 02:24.413
The seven dwarfs?

02:24.448 --> 02:28.241
Florence, why don't you
put your mouth in reverse
and shut up?

02:28.275 --> 02:30.586
Hey, Weezy, I saw Buddy.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.965
-You mean Buddy Hobbs?
-Yeah, good old Uncle Buddy.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.068
Oh, George, that's wonderful!

02:36.103 --> 02:37.862
I never knew you had
an uncle named Buddy.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.034
Well, he ain't my real uncle.

02:39.068 --> 02:41.034
I mean, he's a good friend
of my father's.

02:41.068 --> 02:43.379
After my father died,
he kind of took over the job
of keeping me out of trouble.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.172
-That must have been
a full time job.
-

02:47.206 --> 02:50.448
I'm telling you, boy,
he used to take me everyplace,
the zoo, Coney Island.

02:50.482 --> 02:52.448
I remember the time
he took me to Coney Island,

02:52.482 --> 02:54.448
and let me eat
all the cotton candy
I wanted till I threw up.

02:54.482 --> 02:57.482
Boy, that was fun.

02:57.517 --> 03:00.827
Sounds to me like
you two really knew
how to have a good time.

03:00.862 --> 03:02.689
Yeah, we sure did.
He used to always
give me a quarter

03:02.724 --> 03:04.793
to go to the movies
on Saturdays,
and 10 cents for candy.

03:04.827 --> 03:06.000
I always bought taffy.

03:06.034 --> 03:08.517
Taffy? I used to hate taffy.

03:08.551 --> 03:11.517
It always made
my teeth stick together
so I couldn't open my mouth.

03:11.551 --> 03:13.172
Hey, Weezy, you hear that?

03:13.206 --> 03:15.689
Now we know what to get
Florence for Christmas.

03:18.517 --> 03:21.310
Boy, those were the days.

03:21.344 --> 03:24.034
A kid couldn't ask for
a better pal than old Buddy.

03:24.068 --> 03:27.068
George, it must be
almost 40 years
since you've seen him.

03:27.103 --> 03:29.655
That's right.
He left right after
Pearl Harbor to join the Army.

03:29.689 --> 03:31.827
I remember 'cause I cried
that whole week. Huh!

03:31.862 --> 03:33.448
Oh, where did you
run into Buddy?

03:33.482 --> 03:35.655
Well, it was strange.
I was walking towards
42nd Street, you know.

03:35.689 --> 03:38.000
All of a sudden I hear this
Santa Claus calling to me.

03:38.034 --> 03:41.655
Probably thought you were
one of his elves.

03:41.689 --> 03:45.172
No. He just wanted to meet
the man with the ugliest maid
in New York.

03:46.931 --> 03:49.103
But then he comes
running up to me, you know,

03:49.137 --> 03:51.724
he pulls his beard down
and it's Uncle Buddy, Weezy.
I couldn't believe it!

03:51.758 --> 03:54.827
That's wonderful, George.
Why don't you
invite him over sometime?

03:54.862 --> 03:56.862
I already did.
He'll be here tonight.
Him and Zeke.

03:56.896 --> 03:58.068
Who's Zeke?

03:58.103 --> 04:01.034
Joe Zeke is Buddy's pal.
He knew my father, too.

04:01.068 --> 04:03.241
Good. They can meet
the Willis' and Mr. Bentley.

04:03.275 --> 04:04.965
Why do they have to
meet them for?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.517
George, I invited them over
to practice
our caroling tonight.

04:08.551 --> 04:10.689
Again?

04:10.724 --> 04:13.310
Well, we need plenty of
practice if we are gonna sing
at the children's hospital.

04:13.344 --> 04:16.137
And I'm sure Uncle Buddy
will enjoy himself.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.103
Hmm...
Yeah, okay, okay, Weezy.
Look, I gotta get moving.

04:19.137 --> 04:21.172
I gotta pick up a present
for Buddy. Hey!

04:21.206 --> 04:23.793
Hey, if you're going
Christmas shopping,
remember something.

04:23.827 --> 04:25.137
I don't want no dust mop.

04:25.172 --> 04:27.241
Don't worry about it.

04:27.275 --> 04:30.172
If I got a mop for you,
I'd have to find one that
runs on batteries.

04:33.551 --> 04:36.517
You wanna try one of
my cookies, Miss Jefferson?
I made them with rum.

04:36.551 --> 04:38.517
Oh, rum balls.

04:45.448 --> 04:47.275
You think
they're a little strong?

04:47.310 --> 04:49.689
Just don't serve them
to minors.

04:51.931 --> 04:53.896
Yeah, but I'm telling you,
Ralph, I can handle it
from here.

04:53.931 --> 04:56.241
But, sir,
as long as I carried it
through the lobby,

04:56.275 --> 04:58.793
up the elevator,
across the corridor,

04:58.827 --> 05:01.000
I wouldn't feel
my job was complete,

05:01.034 --> 05:03.586
unless I was able to place it
under your tree.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.206
But I'm still giving you
the same tip.

05:05.241 --> 05:07.310
Well, in that case, sir...

05:08.517 --> 05:10.724
-And Merry Christmas.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:10.758 --> 05:13.448
Here, Ralph.
Try one of these rum balls.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.620
What did you get
for Uncle Buddy, George?

05:17.655 --> 05:19.586
It's a surprise, Weezy.
You'll see.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.586
-I baked them myself.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.137
Did you bake anything
for a chaser?

05:28.034 --> 05:31.310
I better not have
any more of this.
I'm driving the elevator.

05:33.517 --> 05:37.068
Well, sir, if you don't
need me, I think I best
be returning to my post.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.206
Oh, yeah, Ralph, thanks.

05:39.241 --> 05:41.344
-Here you go.
-Thank you, sir.

05:41.379 --> 05:44.689
By the way, you remember that
gift certificate you gave me?

05:44.724 --> 05:48.172
-Yeah.
-Well, I wanted to get
something practical,

05:48.206 --> 05:51.103
so I used it
to purchase this wallet.

05:51.137 --> 05:55.172
-Oh, good choice!
-
I like it very much, sir.

05:55.206 --> 05:57.275
But, uh...

05:57.310 --> 06:02.965
It sure looks empty with just
this single bill down there.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.034
I think what it needs
is some more green.

06:06.068 --> 06:08.965
-Oh, yeah I think
you're right, Ralph.
-Why thank you, sir.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.034
Here.

06:23.482 --> 06:27.241
Well, everything's set.
Now, all we need
are the guests.

06:27.275 --> 06:30.827
Boy, I can't wait till
Uncle Buddy sees this place.
Boy, he's gonna flip!

06:30.862 --> 06:32.206
And I told him
all about you, Weezy.

06:32.241 --> 06:34.586
-Did you tell him
about me, too?
-No.

06:36.241 --> 06:38.172
-Why not?
-Well, Mama always told me

06:38.206 --> 06:42.379
if I ain't got something nice
to say about somebody,
don't say nothing.

06:42.413 --> 06:44.344
Well, in that case,
you ought to wear a muzzle.

06:46.137 --> 06:47.724
-Oh, he's here!

06:47.758 --> 06:50.241
Weezy, get ready.
Come on, Florence, quick.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.862
Okay, open the door.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.724
-Buddy!
-Pal!

06:58.448 --> 07:01.620
-Merry Christmas.
-Bentley, Christmas
ain't till next week.

07:01.655 --> 07:05.448
Yes, I know that, but I wanted
to avoid the Christmas rush.

07:05.482 --> 07:07.517
Mr. Bentley,
you want a rum ball?

07:07.551 --> 07:12.034
Rhumba? Actually,
I'm much better at the tango,
but if you lead...

07:12.068 --> 07:15.448
No, Mr. Bentley,
Florence is talking about
the cookies she baked.

07:15.482 --> 07:19.344
Ah, Christmas cookies.
They warm the cockles
of my heart.

07:23.103 --> 07:25.862
I say, what a beautiful tree!

07:27.620 --> 07:31.379
Um, it's, um,
decorated exquisitely.

07:31.413 --> 07:35.379
You know, it takes me
back to a Christmas
I once spent in Cornwall.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.413
A little snow-covered cottage,

07:37.448 --> 07:41.137
sleigh bells ringing,
chestnuts roasting
on an open fire.

07:41.172 --> 07:43.620
And Jack Frost
nipping at your nose?

07:43.655 --> 07:46.379
Uh, no, it was Sarah
nipping at my ear.

07:51.655 --> 07:54.620
-Hello.
-You gotta be George's wife.

07:54.655 --> 07:57.862
You gotta be crazy!

07:57.896 --> 08:02.034
-Hey! It's Uncle Buddy!
-Georgie! How you doing?

08:02.068 --> 08:05.206
-Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on.
-You give up?
Do you, George?

08:05.241 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I give up. I give up.

08:08.034 --> 08:09.758
-You still got it,
Uncle Buddy.
-Remember, Georgie,

08:09.793 --> 08:12.931
-I always told you,
keep your guard up.
-

08:12.965 --> 08:15.034
Well, this is my friend,
Zeke, Georgie.

08:15.068 --> 08:18.344
-Hey, yeah, I remember Zeke.
What's happening?
-Hiya, George. How are you?

08:18.379 --> 08:21.034
-Hey, hey...
-Hello, Buddy, Zeke.
I'm Louise.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.758
-Hi.
-Georgie, you told me
she was good looking,

08:23.793 --> 08:26.551
but you didn't tell me
you married a younger woman.

08:26.586 --> 08:29.344
Weezy? She ain't that young.
She's almost...

08:29.379 --> 08:32.379
-Remember, Georgie.
Keep your guard up.
-

08:33.758 --> 08:36.172
-Hey, yeah,
this is our maid, Florence.
-BOTH: Hello.

08:36.206 --> 08:38.965
And over here, we have
our next-door neighbor,
Mr. Bentley.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.137
BOTH: Merry Christmas.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.896
Hey, Zeke,
ain't you the one who
used to own that 38 Hudson?

08:43.931 --> 08:47.517
With the big white
walls and the, uh,
propeller hood ornament?

08:47.551 --> 08:50.034
-Right.
-Yeah, man,
that car had everything.

08:50.068 --> 08:53.344
-Except an engine.
-

08:53.379 --> 08:55.551
-Boy, those were
the good old days.
-Yeah.

08:55.586 --> 08:58.103
Not many of the old gang left.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.655
Georgie told me
about his mama passing.

09:00.689 --> 09:03.482
I was really sorry to hear it.
She was quite a woman.

09:03.517 --> 09:05.137
She certainly was.

09:05.172 --> 09:06.793
I remember when
little Georgie here

09:06.827 --> 09:09.655
almost scared his poor mama
to death.

09:09.689 --> 09:13.275
That must have been
when he was born.

09:13.310 --> 09:15.793
Florence, why don't you go,
uh, check on the turkey?

09:15.827 --> 09:18.206
Well, I can see you fine
from right here.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.413
-Florence...
-Now, come on, Florence,
I'll help you.

09:27.103 --> 09:31.034
So, anyway, little Georgie
had this wild imagination.

09:31.068 --> 09:34.586
Once, he got the idea
he was gonna
fly like Superman.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.275
So, he ties his mama's
tablecloth around his neck,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.517
and climbs this telephone pole
out front.

09:39.551 --> 09:42.793
He was only half-way up
when his pants got caught
on one of the spikes.

09:44.068 --> 09:46.000
Oh, I was up there dangling.

09:46.034 --> 09:48.793
And old Buddy pulled me down.
Boy, that scared
the hell out of me.

09:48.827 --> 09:51.379
Georgie, watch your mouth.

09:51.413 --> 09:54.172
Oh. Sorry, Uncle Buddy.
Scared the heck out of me.

09:54.206 --> 09:56.241
That's better, damn it.

09:58.862 --> 10:00.896
Some place
you got here, Georgie.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.862
Yeah, you know,
we got four johns.

10:02.896 --> 10:04.931
Wait, follow me,
I'll give you a grand tour.

10:04.965 --> 10:06.586
Hey, you wanna come, Zeke?

10:06.620 --> 10:09.758
Uh, no, thank you.
I'll just take a tour
of the bar.

10:13.620 --> 10:18.551
-Oh, what can I fix you, Zeke?
-Well, maybe just
a little brandy.

10:18.586 --> 10:21.862
Here. This will take the chill
out of your bones.

10:21.896 --> 10:25.482
Uh, you got a bigger glass?

10:25.517 --> 10:28.689
'Cause these old bones
are colder than you think.

10:30.827 --> 10:34.862
You and Buddy
must go back a long way
if you knew George's father.

10:34.896 --> 10:37.310
Oh, yes, a long way.

10:37.344 --> 10:40.275
You know,
we was real tight back then.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.862
That is till
George's father passed.

10:42.896 --> 10:46.620
Then Buddy started
spending all his time
over at the Jeffersons.

10:46.655 --> 10:49.103
He must have been a big help
to the family.

10:49.137 --> 10:52.965
I guess. Buddy didn't let
nobody get near that house.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.310
I imagine it was nice
for Mother Jefferson
having someone around

10:56.344 --> 10:57.827
to keep the wolves away.

10:57.862 --> 11:01.241
Oh, yeah. Buddy kept them
wolves away all right,

11:01.275 --> 11:04.517
so he could have that
little lamb all to himself.

11:07.310 --> 11:09.137
Wait a minute.

11:09.172 --> 11:12.620
Are you saying that
Buddy and George's mother
were carrying on?

11:12.655 --> 11:15.586
Yeah, sure. Well, I thought
everybody knew that.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.827
Oh, not everybody.

11:17.862 --> 11:22.896
Zeke, whatever you do,
please don't mention this
to George.

11:22.931 --> 11:25.034
-Mention what, Weez?
-Oh.

11:34.724 --> 11:36.655
What is it you don't want me
to know about?

11:36.689 --> 11:41.103
Uh, know about? Oh, uh...
It's nothing.

11:41.137 --> 11:43.206
Zeke, what were you two
talking about?

11:43.241 --> 11:45.620
-Uh, oh, nothing, nothing.
-Uh-huh.

11:45.655 --> 11:48.241
Now, both of you
are telling me it's nothing.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.379
That means
it must be something.

11:49.413 --> 11:51.758
Oh, George,
it's not important.

11:51.793 --> 11:54.448
Well, if it's not important,
why can't you tell me?

11:54.482 --> 11:56.310
Because... Uh, because...

11:58.206 --> 12:00.379
-Because you have to get
the door.
-Weezy, what's...

12:02.206 --> 12:03.793
Uh-huh.

12:03.827 --> 12:05.000
-Hi, George.
Hope we're not late.
-Hi.

12:05.034 --> 12:06.413
Oh, no, you're right on time.

12:06.448 --> 12:09.758
Oh, good. I'd hate to miss out
on our caroling practice.

12:14.862 --> 12:17.827
You need all the practice
you can get.

12:17.862 --> 12:22.965
George, when Helen and I
were in college,
we both sang in a chorale.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.655
That don't surprise me.
It's the perfect place
for zebras.

12:30.172 --> 12:33.586
Uh, Tom, Helen, this is Zeke.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.448
He's a friend
of Uncle Buddy's.

12:35.482 --> 12:37.965
-Oh, how do you do, Zeke?
-Hello.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.344
Cheers.

12:40.379 --> 12:42.655
Oh, yes, Louise told us
all about Uncle Buddy.
Where is he?

12:42.689 --> 12:46.793
He's back there trying
to decide which bathroom
to use.

12:46.827 --> 12:49.793
-Weezy, now, what were
you and Zeke talking about?
-Mmm-mmm.

12:49.827 --> 12:51.862
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Willis,
you're here.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.862
Good. Now we can practice
our carols.

12:53.896 --> 12:54.862
Right. Let's get started.

12:54.896 --> 12:57.137
Oh, no, wait.
Not until I find out.

12:57.172 --> 12:59.137
-Oh, come on, George...
-Weezy...

12:59.172 --> 13:01.310
-Uh, which carol
shall we sing first?
- The First Noel.

13:01.344 --> 13:03.310
- O Little Town of Bethlehem.
- Jingle Bells.

13:03.344 --> 13:08.448
-Tell me the truth.
-Oh, we don't have
the words to that one.

13:08.482 --> 13:10.137
Do you wanna sing along, Zeke?

13:10.172 --> 13:12.793
Oh, no, thank you. I'll just
stay here and drink along.

13:12.827 --> 13:18.068
Well, let's begin with
The Twelve Days of Christmas.

13:18.103 --> 13:20.137
-Oh, I like that.
-That's good.

13:20.172 --> 13:22.206
-I'm waiting to hear, Weez.
-Shh!

13:23.310 --> 13:26.344
ALL:
of Christmas

13:28.827 --> 13:33.241
Look, Weezy,
are you gonna tell me?
Look, I ain't gonna mad or...

13:33.275 --> 13:35.689
Uh, Mr. Jefferson,
that's your part, remember?

13:35.724 --> 13:36.689
Oh.

13:38.827 --> 13:41.172
of Christmas

13:45.034 --> 13:47.379
You gonna tell me or not?

13:47.413 --> 13:50.137
in a pear tree

13:50.172 --> 13:52.724
of Christmas

13:58.068 --> 14:04.068
And a partridge
in a pear tree!

14:04.103 --> 14:09.413
Look, Weezy,
I wanna talk to you.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.620
George, I'll talk to you
as soon as
we finish this song.

14:12.655 --> 14:14.620
of Christmas

14:16.103 --> 14:18.000
Eleven pipers piping,

14:18.034 --> 14:20.000
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking

14:20.034 --> 14:22.000
Six geese a-laying

14:22.034 --> 14:24.000
Four calling birds
Three French hens

14:24.034 --> 14:25.482
And a partridge
in a pear tree

14:25.517 --> 14:27.068
Okay, now you gonna tell me?

14:35.206 --> 14:39.275
It's personal, George.
I'll tell you tonight, in bed.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.275
Mmm, okay,
if you won't tell me,
I'll ask Zeke.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.758
Look, Zeke, you better tell me
what you and Weez
were talking about.

14:43.793 --> 14:46.620
-Oh, no. I promised.
-Okay, look if
you don't tell me...

14:46.655 --> 14:48.034
Zeke, don't say a word.

14:48.068 --> 14:51.620
Don't worry, Louise,
I ain't saying nothing
about George's mama.

14:51.655 --> 14:56.172
Mama? What about Mama?

14:56.206 --> 15:01.655
-Weezy?
-Oh, I better go
check the turkey.

15:01.689 --> 15:03.344
Hey, hey...

15:03.379 --> 15:06.275
-Oh, but we need your voices.
-You all go right ahead.
We'll be back in a minute.

15:06.310 --> 15:13.103
-Weezy...
-Oh, I think
the turkey is done.

15:13.137 --> 15:17.206
Mmm-hmm. Well, I ain't done.
Now forget about the turkey.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.206
What's this big secret
about Mama?

15:19.241 --> 15:24.344
Okay, George,
but it's
a little embarrassing.

15:24.379 --> 15:28.034
-Embarrassing?
-Yeah. It's just that
your mother was...

15:28.068 --> 15:31.724
-Was such a good cook.
-Huh?

15:31.758 --> 15:35.586
Don't you see?
I'm sure Buddy
loved her cooking,

15:35.620 --> 15:39.034
and I'm worried about
what he'll think of my dinner.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.620
-That's all?
-I know it's silly,
George, but...

15:41.655 --> 15:44.655
Oh, come on, Weezy,
that was a long time ago.
Forget about that.

15:44.689 --> 15:47.827
-Everything will be all right.
-Oh, thanks, George.

15:47.862 --> 15:49.620
I feel a lot better.

15:49.655 --> 15:52.275
Yeah. And besides,
Uncle Buddy was in the Army.

15:52.310 --> 15:53.758
He's used to bad cooking.

15:53.793 --> 16:01.241
Okay, now that
that's all settled,
let's get this party started.

16:01.275 --> 16:03.482
Hey, Buddy.
Did you meet everybody?

16:03.517 --> 16:05.137
I sure did, Georgie.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.275
But I didn't mean
to interrupt your singing.

16:07.310 --> 16:09.275
Oh, you didn't
interrupt anything.

16:09.310 --> 16:10.655
In fact,
why don't you join us?

16:10.689 --> 16:12.896
No, no, no, you all play
and do what you was doing.

16:12.931 --> 16:16.724
I got a little something
I wanna show Buddy.

16:16.758 --> 16:17.724
What's up, Georgie?

16:17.758 --> 16:18.724
Here.

16:18.758 --> 16:22.586
-Oh, Georgie...
-Merry Christmas.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.586
-You shouldn't have.
-

16:24.620 --> 16:26.206
Sure, I should have.

16:26.241 --> 16:28.413
After all you've done for me,
that's the least I could do.

16:28.448 --> 16:30.413
Oh, Georgie,

16:30.448 --> 16:32.793
what a beautiful watch!

16:32.827 --> 16:35.862
Yeah, I figured it would
make up for the watch of yours
that I broke when I was a kid.

16:36.931 --> 16:41.137
Shoot, that old thing
only cost me six bucks.

16:41.172 --> 16:44.137
This watch is solid gold.

16:44.172 --> 16:46.620
Not as solid as you,
Uncle Buddy.

16:46.655 --> 16:48.172
Thanks, Georgie.

16:48.206 --> 16:51.551
Hey, you know,
that's one of them fancy kinds
that tells you everything.

16:51.586 --> 16:55.931
I'll say. And right now,
it's telling me I either need
glasses or a longer arm.

16:57.655 --> 16:59.620
Say, Uncle Buddy,
I'm sure glad I found you.

16:59.655 --> 17:01.620
-It's gonna be
just like old times.
-Oh, yeah...

17:01.655 --> 17:03.931
Uh, George, why don't you
go in and carve the turkey.

17:03.965 --> 17:07.137
-Good idea.
-Hey, that's my job, remember?

17:07.172 --> 17:09.379
All the Christmases I spent
with you and your mama,

17:09.413 --> 17:12.172
I always did the carving.
It's tradition.

17:12.206 --> 17:14.034
-I'll help you, Buddy.
-Great.

17:14.068 --> 17:19.862
It ain't often an old coot
like me gets to spend time
with someone as pretty as you.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.137
Oh...

17:21.172 --> 17:25.724
Uh, maybe we can
continue practicing
while we wait, Mr. J.

17:25.758 --> 17:27.931
Go ahead, Bentley.
I wanna have a drink
with my man, Zeke.

17:27.965 --> 17:30.379
Uh, how about Silent Night?

17:30.413 --> 17:32.034
-Oh, yes.
-That's a good one.

17:32.068 --> 17:34.620
Hey, Zeke.

17:34.655 --> 17:37.068
Hey! Relax, Zeke.

17:37.103 --> 17:40.068
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you ain't getting
nothing out of me.

17:40.103 --> 17:42.862
Forget about that.
Weezy already told me
all about Mama.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.482
-She did?
-Yeah, it ain't no big deal.

17:45.517 --> 17:47.310
I'm glad you feel that way.

17:47.344 --> 17:49.620
Man, George,

17:49.655 --> 17:52.793
Buddy sure liked
that watch you gave him.
I could tell.

17:52.827 --> 17:55.172
Yeah, well he deserves
a lot more than that.

17:55.206 --> 17:57.172
I mean, filling in
for my father,

17:57.206 --> 17:59.172
helping Mama out
the way he did.

17:59.206 --> 18:01.724
Yeah. I wonder why
the two of them
never got married.

18:01.758 --> 18:04.275
Huh? The two of who?

18:04.310 --> 18:06.379
Your mama and Buddy.

18:06.413 --> 18:08.241
And why would they do that?

18:08.275 --> 18:13.034
Well, that's what most people
do who carry on the way
Buddy and your Mama did.

18:16.172 --> 18:17.793
What you mean "carry on"?

18:17.827 --> 18:21.862
Well, now anybody could see
that Buddy had it pretty bad
for your mama.

18:21.896 --> 18:23.896
Nigger, you're crazy!

18:23.931 --> 18:28.241
I might be crazy,
but I ain't blind.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.620
No, you're just blind drunk!

18:32.551 --> 18:33.724
Come on.

18:33.758 --> 18:36.448
ALL:

18:37.172 --> 18:38.931
Hey, Buddy,
I got something to ask you.

18:38.965 --> 18:42.000
Boy, George,
this sure is a big bird.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.344
Yeah, right. Listen, Buddy...

18:43.379 --> 18:45.379
Nothing like that
skinny turkey me, you
and your mama had

18:45.413 --> 18:47.379
the Christmas after
your father died, huh?

18:47.413 --> 18:50.655
-Yeah, Buddy, look I gotta...
-Boy, Louise, I still can
remember what I wished for

18:50.689 --> 18:52.655
-when we broke the wish bone.
-You do?

18:52.689 --> 18:54.655
-Yeah. A bigger turkey.
-

18:54.689 --> 18:55.965
Buddy...

18:56.000 --> 18:59.586
Man, those sure were
some good times,
weren't they, Georgie?

18:59.620 --> 19:02.689
The best years of my life.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.689
Yeah, that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

19:04.724 --> 19:06.689
Now, would you stop carving
the turkey for a minute?

19:06.724 --> 19:09.517
Yeah, Georgie. What is it?

19:09.551 --> 19:11.965
Well, I just wanna clear up
something. Now...

19:12.000 --> 19:14.034
Zeke says that, uh, you...

19:14.068 --> 19:17.241
-Excuse me.
But we need your "fa-la's".
-What?

19:17.275 --> 19:19.241
We're about to do
Deck The Halls,

19:19.275 --> 19:21.241
and you and Mrs. J
are supposed to sing
the "fa-la's".

19:21.275 --> 19:23.551
Uh, George, we better go
join the caroling.

19:23.586 --> 19:26.827
-No. Look, Bentley, you need
somebody to "fa-la", right?
-Yes.

19:26.862 --> 19:32.620
Okay. Just turn around
and "fa-la" your nose
right out of here.

19:32.655 --> 19:35.310
-George!
-Now, where was I?

19:35.344 --> 19:38.034
Oh, yeah, right. Uh, okay.

19:38.068 --> 19:39.034
Well,

19:39.068 --> 19:41.034
Zeke said there was
something going on

19:43.068 --> 19:44.068
But Zeke's a liar, ain't he?

19:44.103 --> 19:46.758
ALL:
la la la la

19:46.793 --> 19:49.034
I said,
Zeke is a liar, ain't he?

19:49.068 --> 19:51.275
Look, Georgie,
that was a long time ago.

19:51.310 --> 19:53.034
-Then it's true!
-George...

19:53.068 --> 19:56.655
How could you do something
like that? You're supposed
to be my father's best friend!

19:56.689 --> 19:58.655
-Georgie...
-Look, don't call me
Georgie, chump.

19:58.689 --> 19:59.931
My name is George.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.931
George, that's no way
to talk to Buddy!

20:01.965 --> 20:03.137
The hell it ain't!

20:03.172 --> 20:05.137
I should have known
you was up to something.

20:05.172 --> 20:08.551
-George, listen to me...
-No, hell, no!
You listen to me!

20:08.586 --> 20:10.827
'Cause I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I think of you!

20:10.862 --> 20:12.724
-You are...
-George, please!

20:12.758 --> 20:14.689
Uh, excuse me again.

20:14.724 --> 20:16.103
Bentley, what do you want now?

20:16.137 --> 20:19.413
I'm sorry, but we really
do need you and Mrs. J
for our caroling.

20:19.448 --> 20:21.413
I told you, I don't feel
like singing today.

20:21.448 --> 20:27.448
-If you could just hum
in the background...
-No!

20:29.517 --> 20:32.655
Come on, George,
why don't we go sing?

20:32.689 --> 20:34.655
-No, you go on, Weezy.
-But, I...

20:34.689 --> 20:36.655
Go ahead, Weezy.
Look, you go ahead
out there and sing.

20:36.689 --> 20:40.172
And make sure
they sing a carol
in honor of Buddy.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.172
"I Saw Mama Kissing
Santa Claus."

20:42.206 --> 20:46.137
Let me explain
about your mama and me.

20:46.172 --> 20:48.275
Look, you ain't
got to explain nothing.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.275
All that time you pretended
you cared about me.

20:50.310 --> 20:52.275
And all you cared about
was getting next to Mama.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.896
George, I did care about you.

20:53.931 --> 20:55.965
Oh, man, the hell you did!

20:56.000 --> 20:57.965
Now I know why you was always
sending me to the movies.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
I must have seen Tarzan
10 times.

21:02.034 --> 21:05.103
I wish you could understand.

21:05.137 --> 21:06.413
Oh, I understand now.

21:06.448 --> 21:08.275
I just wish
I could have understood
what was going on then.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.275
I'd have threw your butt
out of the house.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.758
Just like I'm gonna do now.

21:11.793 --> 21:15.103
Well, before you throw me out,
there's something
you have to know.

21:15.137 --> 21:16.793
Look, I know all I wanna know.

21:16.827 --> 21:18.379
No, you don't.

21:18.413 --> 21:21.344
Right before your daddy died,
he asked me to make sure

21:21.379 --> 21:23.965
-you and your mama
were taken care of.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.655
-And you did more taking
than he had in mind.
-George!

21:27.689 --> 21:28.724
How could Mama
do such a thing?

21:28.758 --> 21:30.758
I didn't know she was
that kind of a woman!

21:37.793 --> 21:41.034
Don't you never talk like that
about your mama!

21:41.068 --> 21:43.793
She was the finest lady
I ever knew.

21:43.827 --> 21:46.862
She never did nothing
to be ashamed of. Nothing!

21:51.103 --> 21:52.620
I asked your mama to marry me,

21:52.655 --> 21:57.517
but she said she could never
find a man to take the place
of your daddy.

21:57.551 --> 21:59.448
Now, you can go on hating me,

21:59.482 --> 22:03.137
but there's one thing
we'll always have in common.

22:03.172 --> 22:05.896
We both loved your mama
very much.

22:12.551 --> 22:16.000
Well, Merry Christmas, George.

22:25.137 --> 22:27.551
Okay, kids, uh,
We Wish You A Merry Christmas.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.620
-Mrs. J?
-Huh?

22:32.655 --> 22:34.620
Come on, Zeke, we have to go.

22:34.655 --> 22:37.482
Oh, but this is one of
my favorite songs!

22:37.517 --> 22:39.758
You can sing it to me
on the way home.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.931
Uh, Buddy, can't you stay?

22:42.965 --> 22:45.379
I'm sorry, Louise.
I really can't.

22:45.413 --> 22:47.000
Why not?

22:47.034 --> 22:49.103
Well, I have to get up
for work tomorrow morning.

22:49.137 --> 22:51.586
Thank you for the party.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.620
Hold it, Buddy.

22:52.655 --> 22:58.551
There's one more thing
I forgot to say to you.

22:58.586 --> 22:59.586
Yeah?

23:00.758 --> 23:03.586
Well...

23:03.620 --> 23:05.620
Merry Christmas.

23:17.344 --> 23:18.310
I'm sorry, Buddy.

23:18.344 --> 23:19.310
Well...

23:19.344 --> 23:21.793
You don't have to go, do you?

23:21.827 --> 23:25.655
-Well...
-We sure could use
some help with the chorus.

23:25.689 --> 23:27.586
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

23:27.620 --> 23:32.862
Yeah, Buddy, can't you stay?

23:32.896 --> 23:35.068
I'd love to, George.

23:35.103 --> 23:36.310
Call me Georgie, will you?

23:36.344 --> 23:40.344
Great. Come here.
