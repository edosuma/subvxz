00:23.957 --> 00:25.759
<b> <i>- Nate has</i> </b>
<b> <i>to pull his [bleep] together,</i> </b>

<b>or Gian and I</b>
<b>are going down with him.</b>

<b>- I really doubt</b>

<b>- Those girls can cry</b>
<b>all they want.</b>

00:42.109 --> 00:43.710
<b>I'm laughing on the inside.</b>

00:43.710 --> 00:46.046

00:46.046 --> 00:47.748

<b> <i>announcer:</i> </b>
<b> <i>At the critique,</i> </b>

00:49.149 --> 00:53.086
<b> <i>Team Nunez had</i> </b>
<b> <i>the worst tattoo of the day.</i> </b>

00:53.086 --> 00:55.556
<b>- The two of you must face off.</b>

00:55.556 --> 00:57.558
<b>- You guys are apex predators.</b>

00:57.558 --> 00:59.393
<b>This hurts,</b>

<b> <i>allies were forced</i> </b>

01:04.230 --> 01:05.465

01:05.465 --> 01:07.067
<b> <i>I don't want to do</i> </b>

01:07.067 --> 01:10.237

01:20.080 --> 01:22.516
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

01:24.952 --> 01:26.353
<b>in Kelly's tattoo.</b>

01:26.353 --> 01:28.121
<b>- It's not easy</b>
<b>to find a technical mistake</b>

01:28.121 --> 01:29.990
<b>in Nikki's either.</b>
<b>- It's hard to vote her home</b>

01:29.990 --> 01:32.526
<b>off of that tattoo.</b>
<b>That is [bleep] bad ass tattoo.</b>

01:32.526 --> 01:34.862
<b>- If you look</b>
<b>at these scarves...</b>

01:34.862 --> 01:36.563

03:53.433 --> 03:55.569
<b>This is one of</b>

<b>And also on the line is</b>

<b>To earn a spot</b>
<b>in this year's live finale,</b>

04:23.697 --> 04:27.801

<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

<b>I can't imagine</b>

04:33.841 --> 04:36.877
<b>let alone a 15-hour marathon.</b>

04:36.877 --> 04:39.913
<b>- You must tattoo</b>
<b>every style that you critiqued</b>

04:39.913 --> 04:42.850
<b>as the jury of peers</b>
<b>and did not tattoo.</b>

04:42.850 --> 04:46.320
<b>So, it turns out you aren't safe</b>
<b>from those styles after all.</b>

04:46.320 --> 04:48.355
<b>For the first five hours,</b>

04:48.355 --> 04:50.924
<b>Team Peck,</b>
<b>you'll tattoo Medusas,</b>

04:50.924 --> 04:53.660
<b>while Team Nunez,</b>
<b>you'll tattoo a peacock.</b>

04:53.660 --> 04:55.796
<b>- Crazy.</b>
<b>- The next five hours,</b>

04:55.796 --> 04:58.832
<b>Team Peck will create</b>
<b>watercolor tattoos,</b>

04:58.832 --> 05:02.803
<b>while Team Nunez tattoos</b>
<b>outer space.</b>

05:02.803 --> 05:06.039
<b>- Watercolor?</b>
<b>I am not a color tattoo artist,</b>

05:06.039 --> 05:09.643
<b> <i>and this is the most colorful</i> </b>
<b> <i>of color tattoos.</i> </b>

05:09.643 --> 05:11.478
<b>How am I going to pull that off?</b>

05:11.478 --> 05:13.247
<b>- And for the final five hours,</b>

05:13.247 --> 05:17.217
<b>Team Peck must tattoo</b>
<b>a new-school landmark.</b>

05:17.217 --> 05:19.920
<b>Team Nunez tattoos a pin-up.</b>

05:19.920 --> 05:23.390
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>I thought I was safe,</b>

05:23.390 --> 05:26.159
<b>and I wouldn't have</b>
<b>to revisit peacocks</b>

05:26.159 --> 05:28.328
<b>and space and pin-ups.</b>

05:28.328 --> 05:30.964
<b>- After each five-hour tattoo</b>
<b>is completed,</b>

05:30.964 --> 05:32.966
<b>the judges will critique</b>
<b>your work.</b>

05:32.966 --> 05:35.802
<b>The artist that wins</b>

<b>If you don't have</b>
<b>the best tattoo that day,</b>

05:42.576 --> 05:45.112
<b>you must continue tattooing</b>
<b>in the marathon.</b>

05:45.112 --> 05:47.214
<b> <i>- I need to nail this</i> </b>
<b> <i>on day one,</i> </b>

05:47.214 --> 05:48.515
<b>and I won't have to worry</b>

<b>about having to do</b>
<b>two color challenges</b>

05:51.218 --> 05:53.086
<b> <i>in the following days.</i> </b>

05:53.086 --> 05:55.689
<b>- You'll be judged</b>
<b>on all of the skills.</b>

05:55.689 --> 05:58.425
<b>Artistry, composition,</b>

05:58.425 --> 06:00.794
<b>ingenuity, texture,</b>

06:00.794 --> 06:04.064
<b>precision, legibility, contrast.</b>

06:04.064 --> 06:07.734
<b>Everything you need</b>
<b>to create a bulletproof tattoo.</b>

06:07.734 --> 06:09.870
<b>Your canvases</b>
<b>for each of the tattoos</b>

06:09.870 --> 06:13.774
<b>have been randomly assigned</b>
<b>and are completely open.</b>

06:13.774 --> 06:15.042
<b>- This is it.</b>

06:15.042 --> 06:18.045
<b>This is the final string</b>
<b>of competitions</b>

06:18.045 --> 06:20.047
<b>that are going to get you</b>
<b>into the finale.</b>

06:20.047 --> 06:22.049
<b>Hitting the challenge</b>
<b>that you're supposed to hit,</b>

06:22.049 --> 06:24.084
<b>and flawless</b>
<b>technical application</b>

06:24.084 --> 06:25.385
<b>is what it's gonna take.</b>

06:25.385 --> 06:26.753
<b>- You guys do have an advantage.</b>

06:26.753 --> 06:28.889
<b>If you were paying attention</b>
<b>in the critiques,</b>

06:28.889 --> 06:30.858
<b>then you guys all heard</b>
<b>what it was</b>

06:30.858 --> 06:32.459
<b>that we didn't like</b>
<b>about those things.</b>

06:32.459 --> 06:34.328
<b>You know exactly what</b>
<b>to come out and do.</b>

06:34.328 --> 06:36.330
<b>Draw,</b>
<b>make something good,</b>

06:36.330 --> 06:39.066
<b>tattoo well,</b>
<b>get a spot.</b>

06:39.066 --> 06:41.068
<b>- Now all four of you</b>
<b>can head to your shops,</b>

06:41.068 --> 06:44.805
<b>and we'll send in your canvases</b>
<b>for the first five-hour tattoo.</b>

06:44.805 --> 06:45.873

06:45.873 --> 06:48.275

<b>the most intense challenge</b>

06:50.077 --> 06:52.379

<b>to make it into the finale.</b>

06:52.379 --> 06:54.515
<b> <i>We're testing</i> </b>

<b>All right, team,</b>
<b>how y'all doing?</b>

06:57.518 --> 06:58.785
<b> <i>Between me and Nunez,</i> </b>

06:58.785 --> 07:00.654
<b>this has been</b>
<b>a friendly competition...</b>

07:00.654 --> 07:02.823
<b>- All you've got to do</b>
<b>is get that first seat.</b>

07:02.823 --> 07:04.591
<b> <i>- But I can definitely tell</i> </b>

07:04.591 --> 07:06.693
<b>that now he's worried</b>
<b>that Team Peck</b>

07:06.693 --> 07:08.695
<b>might clean-sweep</b>
<b>this whole competition.</b>

07:08.695 --> 07:11.031
<b>Everybody should</b>
<b>come out blazing for this.</b>

07:11.031 --> 07:13.166
<b>- So going against Kelly</b>
<b>on a color tattoo,</b>

07:13.166 --> 07:16.103
<b>do you think we should go color</b>
<b>on her Medusas?</b>

07:16.103 --> 07:17.838
<b>- If I was Ryan,</b>
<b>I would definitely</b>

07:17.838 --> 07:20.040
<b>do black and gray on the Medusa.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

07:20.040 --> 07:22.276
<b>- If I was you,</b>
<b>I would do whatever you feel</b>

07:22.276 --> 07:24.278
<b>more comfortable with.</b>
<b>She's gonna be hard to beat.</b>

07:24.278 --> 07:25.646
<b>Y'all all know she's solid.</b>

07:25.646 --> 07:28.649
<b>I mean, technically</b>
<b>she's clean as [bleep].</b>

07:28.649 --> 07:31.151
<b>- There's really nothing</b>
<b>that breeds paranoia</b>

07:31.151 --> 07:34.388
<b>like watching three people</b>
<b>try to beat you at once.</b>

07:34.388 --> 07:37.391
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

07:37.391 --> 07:40.561
<b>My first thought was like,</b>
<b>traditional.</b>

07:40.561 --> 07:43.063
<b>You know, traditional.</b>
<b>Do a Gian tattoo,</b>

07:43.063 --> 07:46.066
<b>but if you think I can get it</b>
<b>with new-school, like, I--</b>

07:46.066 --> 07:47.367
<b>- Do you think you can get it</b>
<b>with new-school?</b>

07:47.367 --> 07:49.102
<b>- I can kill anybody</b>
<b>with new-school.</b>

07:49.102 --> 07:50.470
<b>- So just go do it.</b>

07:50.470 --> 07:52.172
<b>- But I don't want to be</b>
<b>the new-school artist</b>

07:52.172 --> 07:54.074
<b>that can't do anything else.</b>

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
<b>- Let's do what you want to do,</b>

07:56.076 --> 07:58.645
<b>but whatever your choice is,</b>
<b>you're gonna battle them.</b>

07:58.645 --> 08:00.781

<b>Like, today could be a day where</b>

08:05.085 --> 08:06.687

08:35.716 --> 08:38.118
<b>For your first five hours,</b>
<b>Team Peck,</b>

08:38.118 --> 08:39.753
<b>you're tattooing a Medusa,</b>

08:39.753 --> 08:43.090
<b>and Team Nunez,</b>
<b>you're tattooing a peacock.</b>

08:43.090 --> 08:44.591
<b>Your time</b>

08:44.591 --> 08:46.894
<b>starts now.</b>

08:46.894 --> 08:48.562
<b>- Okay.</b>

08:48.562 --> 08:49.897
<b>- All right, buddy.</b>

08:49.897 --> 08:51.632
<b> <i>- Going into</i> </b>
<b> <i>this first challenge,</i> </b>

08:51.632 --> 08:52.966
<b> <i>Kelly has the advantage,</i> </b>

08:52.966 --> 08:55.769
<b>because it's peacock</b>
<b>versus three Medusas.</b>

08:55.769 --> 08:59.072
<b> <i>Stereotypically,</i> </b>
<b> <i>Medusas are very tricky.</i> </b>

08:59.072 --> 09:01.408
<b>- Oh, hell yeah.</b>
<b>Let's do this.</b>

09:01.408 --> 09:03.844
<b> <i>- I think it would be</i> </b>
<b> <i>pretty hard for my team members</i> </b>

09:03.844 --> 09:05.913
<b> <i>to hedge Kelly out,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but at this point,</i> </b>

09:05.913 --> 09:06.914
<b>anything can happen.</b>

09:06.914 --> 09:07.915
<b>- All right, ready?</b>

09:07.915 --> 09:09.216
<b>- I'm ready.</b>

09:09.216 --> 09:14.288
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

09:14.288 --> 09:16.657
<b>- Going for it.</b>

09:16.657 --> 09:19.359
<b> <i>Today, I'm designing</i> </b>
<b> <i>a neo-traditional Medusa head.</i> </b>

09:19.359 --> 09:20.827
<b> <i>This is what</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm most comfortable with.</i> </b>

09:20.827 --> 09:23.330
<b>I'm gonna [bleep]</b>
<b>rock this thing.</b>

09:23.330 --> 09:25.666
<b>What do you guys think?</b>
<b>- So far, so good.</b>

09:25.666 --> 09:27.134
<b> <i>- I don't know who's gonna get</i> </b>
<b> <i>the first seat,</i> </b>

09:27.134 --> 09:29.570
<b>I just hope it's me.</b>
<b>'Cause I hate watercolor,</b>

09:29.570 --> 09:31.905
<b>and I hate new-school.</b>

09:31.905 --> 09:33.440
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

09:33.440 --> 09:35.642
<b>- Look at you, you didn't do it.</b>

09:35.642 --> 09:37.444
<b>- I didn't do new-school.</b>

09:37.444 --> 09:39.613
<b>I've given you new-school</b>
<b>too many times.</b>

09:39.613 --> 09:42.583
<b>I feel really strong</b>
<b>with this design.</b>

09:42.583 --> 09:44.718
<b> <i>I'm doing an illustrative,</i> </b>

09:44.718 --> 09:47.154
<b> <i>realism peacock.</i> </b>

09:47.154 --> 09:49.857
<b>Got to include some fundamentals</b>
<b>and stuff that,</b>

09:49.857 --> 09:51.358
<b>like, maybe</b>
<b>I didn't get to show.</b>

09:51.358 --> 09:54.294
<b>Growing up,</b>
<b>my mom was a single mom,</b>

09:54.294 --> 09:57.664
<b>and she had three jobs</b>
<b>at a time.</b>

09:57.664 --> 10:01.168
<b>So I was raised</b>
<b>by my grandparents.</b>

10:01.168 --> 10:02.402
<b> <i>My grandmother,</i> </b>

10:02.402 --> 10:04.004
<b>she died</b>

10:04.004 --> 10:06.607
<b>just as I was starting</b>

10:06.607 --> 10:08.208
<b>my apprenticeship,</b>

10:08.208 --> 10:11.345
<b> <i>and she never got</i> </b>
<b> <i>to see me tattoo,</i> </b>

10:11.345 --> 10:14.181
<b> <i>but I like to think that</i> </b>

10:14.181 --> 10:17.551
<b>she would be proud of me</b>
<b>right now.</b>

10:17.551 --> 10:19.453
<b>- Kelly's peacock...</b>
<b>- It looks like a baby vulture.</b>

10:19.453 --> 10:20.654
<b>- Right.</b>

10:20.654 --> 10:22.656
<b>- This was Kelly's</b>
<b>easiest day to win,</b>

10:22.656 --> 10:24.825
<b>because it's peacock</b>
<b>against Medusa.</b>

10:24.825 --> 10:26.660
<b>- I don't know,</b>
<b>with this realistic approach,</b>

10:26.660 --> 10:28.629
<b>that switch out,</b>
<b>that's, like, totally her.</b>

10:28.629 --> 10:30.197
<b>She's like, I want</b>
<b>to show you guys something,</b>

10:30.197 --> 10:32.232
<b>but now is not the time.</b>
<b>Now is the time to just--</b>

10:32.232 --> 10:33.800
<b>- Now's the time</b>
<b>to grab that seat.</b>

10:33.800 --> 10:36.370
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Three hours to go, guys.</b>

10:36.370 --> 10:38.205
<b>Three hours.</b>

10:38.205 --> 10:40.407
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

10:40.407 --> 10:41.942
<b> <i>- I am a black and gray artist.</i> </b>

10:41.942 --> 10:44.211
<b> <i>If I'm going to earn a place</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the finale,</i> </b>

10:44.211 --> 10:47.114
<b>I need to earn it</b>
<b>with a black and gray tattoo.</b>

10:47.114 --> 10:50.017
<b>- Heavy on the black.</b>
<b>- I do a lot of high contrast.</b>

10:50.017 --> 10:53.754
<b> <i>The only concern I have</i> </b>
<b> <i>going into this tattoo is time.</i> </b>

10:53.754 --> 10:55.055
<b>I'm almost there.</b>

10:55.055 --> 10:59.159
<b>Because I am attempting</b>
<b>a lot of detail here.</b>

10:59.159 --> 11:02.596
<b>Chris, for detail and line work,</b>
<b>this is what I like to do.</b>

11:02.596 --> 11:04.731
<b> <i>- Ryan should</i> </b>
<b> <i>really be sweating it.</i> </b>

11:04.731 --> 11:08.068
<b>This big, crazy-detailed Medusa</b>
<b>looks like a ten-hour piece.</b>

11:08.068 --> 11:10.804
<b> <i>She's not gonna be able</i> </b>
<b> <i>to complete that.</i> </b>

11:10.804 --> 11:12.472
<b>I'm gonna do</b>
<b>some different line waves,</b>

11:12.472 --> 11:14.408
<b>but I'm going bold.</b>

11:14.408 --> 11:16.276
<b> <i>I'm doing</i> </b>
<b> <i>a traditional-based Medusa.</i> </b>

11:16.276 --> 11:17.845
<b>All the snakes are bad ass.</b>

11:17.845 --> 11:20.380
<b>- I like the eyes.</b>
<b>- The eyes are the trick.</b>

11:20.380 --> 11:23.083
<b> <i>My Medusa design</i> </b>
<b> <i>is better than the other two.</i> </b>

11:23.083 --> 11:25.419
<b>I definitely have a shot</b>
<b>at winning this right now.</b>

11:25.419 --> 11:27.754
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

11:27.754 --> 11:30.757
<b>- Five, four, three,</b>

11:30.757 --> 11:32.626
<b>two, one.</b>

11:32.626 --> 11:33.927
<b>That's it, machines down.</b>

11:33.927 --> 11:36.697
<b>Time is up.</b>
<b>No more ink.</b>

11:36.697 --> 11:38.699
<b>- It looks awesome.</b>
<b>- It does.</b>

11:38.699 --> 11:40.267
<b>I'm, like, mesmerized.</b>

11:40.267 --> 11:41.468
<b>- That's what Medusa does.</b>

11:41.468 --> 11:43.136
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>I know.</b>

11:43.136 --> 11:45.472
<b>- I like Nate's face.</b>
<b>- I don't like the snake heads,</b>

11:45.472 --> 11:47.140
<b>but the approach is cool.</b>

11:50.377 --> 11:52.779
<b>Should be interesting.</b>

11:52.779 --> 11:54.114
<b>This one didn't work out</b>
<b>for you.</b>

11:54.114 --> 11:56.216
<b>- You just made weird decisions.</b>

11:56.216 --> 11:57.651
<b>- It's just strange.</b>

11:57.651 --> 11:58.719
<b>- I was just overthinking it.</b>

11:58.719 --> 12:00.120
<b>- Best tattoo of the day</b>

12:00.120 --> 12:02.689
<b>goes to the finale, guaranteed.</b>

12:05.675 --> 12:08.678
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

12:08.678 --> 12:15.619
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

12:17.787 --> 12:19.556
<b>- The four of you</b>
<b>are at the beginning</b>

12:19.556 --> 12:23.193
<b>of a grueling</b>
<b>15-hour tattoo marathon.</b>

12:23.193 --> 12:25.829
<b>And the artist that wins</b>
<b>the best tattoo of the day</b>

12:25.829 --> 12:27.898
<b>will secure the first spot</b>

12:27.898 --> 12:30.267
<b>in the live finale.</b>

12:30.267 --> 12:32.936
<b>Team Peck,</b>
<b>you tattooed a Medusa.</b>

12:32.936 --> 12:34.938
<b>Ryan, let's start with you.</b>

12:34.938 --> 12:36.573
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

12:36.573 --> 12:38.842
<b>Ryan, how you feeling at</b>
<b>this point in the competition?</b>

12:38.842 --> 12:41.011
<b>- This is the opportunity where</b>
<b>you're supposed to bring</b>

12:41.011 --> 12:42.846
<b>the big guns out</b>
<b>and show what you have.</b>

12:42.846 --> 12:45.415
<b> <i>So I designed a ten-hour tattoo</i> </b>

12:45.415 --> 12:49.052
<b>that I shrunk down and attempted</b>
<b>in five hours.</b>

12:49.052 --> 12:50.954
<b>- Simpler would've been</b>
<b>a lot better.</b>

12:50.954 --> 12:54.024
<b> <i>You added things to make it</i> </b>
<b> <i>hard to see what's going on.</i> </b>

12:54.024 --> 12:55.892
<b> <i>Why you would put the blood</i> </b>
<b> <i>coming out of the bottom lip</i> </b>

12:55.892 --> 12:57.894
<b> <i>like that and hide</i> </b>
<b> <i>the beauty of the mouth,</i> </b>

12:57.894 --> 13:00.363
<b>it muddies it up and makes it</b>
<b>more confusing to see.</b>

13:00.363 --> 13:02.165
<b> <i>No teeth, no tongues.</i> </b>
<b> <i>Why not?</i> </b>

13:02.165 --> 13:03.533
<b> <i>- I decided to keep it simple.</i> </b>

13:03.533 --> 13:05.235
<b> <i>- You want to make those snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>look fierce?</i> </b>

13:05.235 --> 13:06.603
<b>Teeth and tongues.</b>

13:06.603 --> 13:07.804
<b>- This one didn't</b>
<b>work out for you.</b>

13:07.804 --> 13:10.707
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

13:10.707 --> 13:12.876
<b>- Gian.</b>

13:12.876 --> 13:15.078
<b>- There's a lot of things</b>
<b>I really like about this tattoo.</b>

13:15.078 --> 13:16.613
<b> <i>I like the composition</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the way</i> </b>

13:16.613 --> 13:18.148
<b> <i>the snakes wrap around</i> </b>
<b> <i>the head.</i> </b>

13:18.148 --> 13:20.250
<b> <i>The big snake head with</i> </b>
<b> <i>its mouth open is awesome.</i> </b>

13:20.250 --> 13:21.485
<b> <i>Best snake head in the room.</i> </b>

13:21.485 --> 13:23.119
<b>- Technically it is very nice,</b>

13:23.119 --> 13:26.022
<b> <i>but this whole tattoo has</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot of strange shapes.</i> </b>

13:26.022 --> 13:28.091
<b> <i>Tongue's coming out of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the right side of her mouth</i> </b>

13:28.091 --> 13:29.426
<b> <i>more so than the center.</i> </b>

13:29.426 --> 13:31.461
<b> <i>Also, these eyelids</i> </b>
<b> <i>are driving me nuts.</i> </b>

13:31.461 --> 13:33.330
<b> <i>You highlighted</i> </b>
<b> <i>the bottom eyelids</i> </b>

13:33.330 --> 13:35.432
<b> <i>and gave her eyes</i> </b>
<b> <i>such a bizarre,</i> </b>

13:35.432 --> 13:36.933
<b> <i>bugging-out, weird look.</i> </b>

13:36.933 --> 13:38.468
<b>- I was just overthinking it,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

13:38.468 --> 13:39.836
<b>- I always like your tattoos.</b>

13:39.836 --> 13:41.972
<b>This is one</b>
<b>I'm just not feeling.</b>

13:41.972 --> 13:44.975
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

13:44.975 --> 13:47.644
<b>- Nate.</b>

13:47.644 --> 13:49.813
<b>- I really like the way</b>
<b>you colored this thing.</b>

13:49.813 --> 13:51.248
<b> <i>I love the scales</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you put in</i> </b>

13:51.248 --> 13:52.749
<b> <i>the center of the forehead,</i> </b>

13:52.749 --> 13:54.918
<b> <i>and my favorite part of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the entire tattoo is her neck.</i> </b>

13:54.918 --> 13:56.753
<b> <i>The way you ended her neck</i> </b>

13:56.753 --> 13:58.555
<b> <i>to that knot of snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>at the bottom</i> </b>

13:58.555 --> 13:59.556
<b>gave it a nice frame.</b>

13:59.556 --> 14:01.224
<b>- Not a fan of the snake heads.</b>

14:01.224 --> 14:02.826
<b> <i>They don't look like</i> </b>
<b> <i>they're a part of the snake.</i> </b>

14:02.826 --> 14:05.028
<b> <i>They look like they're attached</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the end of the snake.</i> </b>

14:05.028 --> 14:07.831
<b>But the biggest weakness is</b>
<b>these tiny little</b>

14:07.831 --> 14:09.232
<b> <i>open pieces of skin</i> </b>

14:09.232 --> 14:11.968
<b> <i>between the snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>where here head will still be.</i> </b>

14:11.968 --> 14:13.703
<b> <i>Makes it look like</i> </b>
<b> <i>you cut her head off</i> </b>

14:13.703 --> 14:15.839
<b> <i>and put this crown of snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>on it.</i> </b>

14:15.839 --> 14:17.440
<b>It's definitely</b>
<b>something you missed.</b>

14:17.440 --> 14:21.878
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

14:21.878 --> 14:24.714
<b>- Team Nunez.</b>
<b>That's Kelly.</b>

14:24.714 --> 14:26.049
<b>You tattooed a peacock.</b>

14:26.049 --> 14:29.419
<b>Come on down,</b>
<b>let's see how you did.</b>

14:29.419 --> 14:32.022
<b>- Kelly, the tattooing here</b>
<b>is spectacular.</b>

14:32.022 --> 14:34.257
<b> <i>There is so much texture</i> </b>
<b> <i>to that beak,</i> </b>

14:34.257 --> 14:35.892
<b> <i>the way it rises and falls,</i> </b>

14:35.892 --> 14:38.195
<b> <i>and the way that you put</i> </b>
<b> <i>the true gray over the white,</i> </b>

14:38.195 --> 14:39.729
<b> <i>directly over</i> </b>
<b> <i>the top of the eye</i> </b>

14:39.729 --> 14:41.131
<b> <i>and gave us that indention,</i> </b>

14:41.131 --> 14:44.835
<b> <i>really gives that bird's head</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot of shape.</i> </b>

14:44.835 --> 14:47.037
<b>- For this tattoo,</b>
<b>the one feather</b>

14:47.037 --> 14:49.172
<b> <i>behind the head</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the eye in it is awesome.</i> </b>

14:49.172 --> 14:50.407
<b> <i>The detail is amazing.</i> </b>

14:50.407 --> 14:52.976
<b>But as far as</b>
<b>the look of the bird,</b>

14:52.976 --> 14:54.945
<b> <i>short neck, weird little head,</i> </b>

14:54.945 --> 14:56.480
<b> <i>it looks like a baby peacock,</i> </b>

14:56.480 --> 14:58.348
<b> <i>but then you colored it</i> </b>
<b> <i>like an adult.</i> </b>

14:58.348 --> 15:00.250
<b>You missed the mark on</b>
<b>what a peacock looks like.</b>

15:00.250 --> 15:05.188
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

15:05.188 --> 15:06.189
<b>- All right, judges.</b>

15:06.189 --> 15:07.324
<b>Time to determine</b>

15:07.324 --> 15:09.559
<b>who had the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

15:09.559 --> 15:12.095
<b>Best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to the finale,</b>

15:12.095 --> 15:13.330
<b>guaranteed.</b>

15:13.330 --> 15:16.132
<b>- Ryan, you just made</b>
<b>weird decisions.</b>

15:16.132 --> 15:17.868
<b>- What about between</b>
<b>Gian and Nate?</b>

15:17.868 --> 15:19.836
<b>- Gian's tattoo:</b>
<b>great snakes,</b>

15:19.836 --> 15:20.871
<b> <i>great shape of the head.</i> </b>

15:20.871 --> 15:22.739
<b>The rest of it, very strange.</b>

15:22.739 --> 15:25.809
<b>Nate's tattoo: probably</b>
<b>my favorite of the Medusas.</b>

15:25.809 --> 15:28.278
<b> <i>- But just the way those snakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>are just kind of</i> </b>

15:28.278 --> 15:30.480
<b>crushed into</b>
<b>the top of this head,</b>

15:30.480 --> 15:32.082
<b> <i>it just doesn't make any sense.</i> </b>

15:32.082 --> 15:34.518
<b>- Yeah, I don't think any of</b>
<b>those three are the winner.</b>

15:34.518 --> 15:36.419
<b>Kelly knocks it out of the park</b>

15:36.419 --> 15:38.588
<b>and tattoos circles</b>
<b>around those tattoos.</b>

15:38.588 --> 15:40.724
<b>- The drawing,</b>
<b>it doesn't look like a peacock.</b>

15:40.724 --> 15:41.858
<b>- Come on.</b>

15:41.858 --> 15:43.727
<b>- Taking everything</b>
<b>into consideration,</b>

15:43.727 --> 15:44.728
<b>I'm leaning for Gian.</b>

15:44.728 --> 15:45.829
<b>- Gian for best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

15:45.829 --> 15:47.831
<b>- Technically, I love the style.</b>

15:47.831 --> 15:49.199
<b> <i>That snake, the open mouth.</i> </b>

15:49.199 --> 15:50.734
<b> <i>I love the style of</i> </b>
<b> <i>the girl's head.</i> </b>

15:50.734 --> 15:51.735
<b> <i>It's clean.</i> </b>

15:51.735 --> 15:53.470
<b>- Final decision.</b>

15:53.470 --> 15:54.905
<b>- Gian.</b>

15:54.905 --> 15:56.006
<b>- Kelly.</b>

15:56.006 --> 15:59.743
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

15:59.743 --> 16:01.311
<b>- My vote's for Kelly.</b>

16:01.311 --> 16:02.879
<b>The judges have decided</b>

16:02.879 --> 16:06.683
<b>the best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to Kelly.</b>

16:06.683 --> 16:08.218
<b>Congratulations, Kelly.</b>

16:08.218 --> 16:10.520
<b>That means that you have</b>
<b>earned your spot</b>

16:10.520 --> 16:12.789
<b>in the live finale.</b>

16:12.789 --> 16:14.224
<b>- Attagirl.</b>
<b>I lost 'em all,</b>

16:14.224 --> 16:16.593
<b>but we're first in the race.</b>

16:16.593 --> 16:18.061
<b>- Congratulations, Kelly.</b>

16:18.061 --> 16:19.329
<b>- Thank you very, very much.</b>

16:19.329 --> 16:20.564
<b>- You earned it.</b>

16:20.564 --> 16:21.865
<b>You've been consistent</b>
<b>throughout.</b>

16:21.865 --> 16:23.300
<b>You've done some</b>
<b>really great tattoos here.</b>

16:23.300 --> 16:25.068
<b>- Kelly, chillin'.</b>

16:25.068 --> 16:26.069
<b>- Like a villain.</b>

16:26.069 --> 16:28.572
<b>- So happy for you.</b>

16:28.572 --> 16:30.841
<b>Ryan, Gian, and Nate.</b>

16:30.841 --> 16:33.844
<b>There are three of you left,</b>
<b>but only two open spots</b>

16:33.844 --> 16:35.111
<b>in the finale.</b>

16:35.111 --> 16:38.782
<b>To earn one, you must continue</b>
<b>to battle it out.</b>

16:38.782 --> 16:40.116
<b>For the next five-hour tattoo,</b>

16:40.116 --> 16:42.486
<b>since there's no other team</b>
<b>standing,</b>

16:42.486 --> 16:47.157
<b>Team Peck, you must create</b>
<b>a watercolor tattoo.</b>

16:47.157 --> 16:48.492
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

16:48.492 --> 16:50.794
<b>- Guys, you've still got</b>
<b>pretty good odds.</b>

16:50.794 --> 16:52.329
<b>You've got two more tattoos.</b>

16:52.329 --> 16:54.798
<b>This next challenge coming up</b>
<b>is a doozy.</b>

16:54.798 --> 16:56.733
<b>At this point,</b>
<b>anybody can take it.</b>

16:56.733 --> 16:57.834
<b>- Good luck.</b>

17:08.044 --> 17:11.047
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

17:11.047 --> 17:13.316
<b>- Okay, Team Peck,</b>
<b>three of you remain,</b>

17:13.316 --> 17:16.453
<b>but there are only two spots</b>
<b>in the live finale.</b>

17:16.453 --> 17:18.688
<b>Every drop of ink counts.</b>

17:18.688 --> 17:21.458
<b>You will have five hours</b>
<b>to tattoo,</b>

17:21.458 --> 17:23.059
<b>and your time</b>

17:23.059 --> 17:25.529
<b>starts now.</b>

17:25.529 --> 17:26.896
<b>- Let's do it, buddy.</b>

17:26.896 --> 17:28.064
<b>- Just stand right here for me,</b>

17:28.064 --> 17:29.799
<b>and then</b>
<b>I'll get your stencil on.</b>

17:29.799 --> 17:31.535
<b>- Let me see your back</b>
<b>real quick.</b>

17:31.535 --> 17:33.370
<b>- In this challenge,</b>
<b>it's just Team Peck.</b>

17:33.370 --> 17:37.340
<b> <i>Everybody's got to do</i> </b>
<b> <i>a watercolor tattoo.</i> </b>

17:37.340 --> 17:39.476
<b> <i>One thing I'm looking for</i> </b>
<b> <i>in a watercolor tattoo</i> </b>

17:39.476 --> 17:41.812
<b>is for a tattoo that actually</b>
<b>looks like a painting</b>

17:41.812 --> 17:45.849
<b>versus just spilled ink</b>
<b>on someone's skin.</b>

17:45.849 --> 17:49.386
<b>- I almost think maybe it should</b>
<b>be, like, black and gray.</b>

17:49.386 --> 17:51.955
<b>I don't think anybody's</b>
<b>going in that direction.</b>

17:51.955 --> 17:53.223
<b>- You do you, man.</b>
<b>- Okay, cool.</b>

17:53.223 --> 17:55.826
<b>A win right now</b>
<b>would be amazing.</b>

17:55.826 --> 17:59.029
<b>Now I've got to try and do</b>
<b>a bad-ass watercolor.</b>

17:59.029 --> 18:00.730
<b> <i>Gian doesn't do watercolors.</i> </b>

18:00.730 --> 18:03.099
<b> <i>I don't know if Ryan does</i> </b>
<b> <i>much watercolor either.</i> </b>

18:03.099 --> 18:04.501
<b> <i>It's something that I do.</i> </b>

18:04.501 --> 18:05.769
<b>I'm gonna try and kill this one.</b>

18:05.769 --> 18:07.671
<b>- You making le tigre?</b>

18:07.671 --> 18:08.672
<b>- I'm doing a tiger.</b>

18:08.672 --> 18:10.073
<b>- Nice, dude.</b>

18:10.073 --> 18:13.343
<b>- Torn between</b>
<b>should I just go black and gray?</b>

18:13.343 --> 18:14.444
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

18:14.444 --> 18:16.680
<b> <i>- Nate just blew my mind.</i> </b>

18:16.680 --> 18:20.016
<b> <i>He wants to do black and gray</i> </b>
<b> <i>for the watercolor tattoo.</i> </b>

18:20.016 --> 18:22.252
<b>You could, if you want to lose.</b>

18:22.252 --> 18:24.354
<b>But that doesn't look</b>
<b>very watercolor-y.</b>

18:24.354 --> 18:25.856
<b> <i>You're gonna go up against</i> </b>
<b> <i>two other people</i> </b>

18:25.856 --> 18:27.524
<b>that are doing</b>
<b>full-color renditions,</b>

18:27.524 --> 18:29.459
<b>so it's immediately</b>
<b>gonna take you out.</b>

18:29.459 --> 18:31.862
<b>I can't really give you</b>
<b>any creative advice other than</b>

18:31.862 --> 18:33.196
<b>don't do black and gray.</b>

18:33.196 --> 18:34.598
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:34.598 --> 18:36.700
<b>- Three hours, Team Peck.</b>

18:36.700 --> 18:38.535
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

18:38.535 --> 18:40.070
<b>- Dude, that looks awesome.</b>

18:40.070 --> 18:41.872
<b>- I dropped the ball yesterday.</b>

18:41.872 --> 18:43.240
<b>I'm trying.</b>

18:43.240 --> 18:45.842
<b> <i>The Medusa challenge was</i> </b>
<b> <i>supposed to be my day,</i> </b>

18:45.842 --> 18:50.046
<b>but I let the stress and</b>
<b>the pressure affect my work.</b>

18:50.046 --> 18:51.715
<b>- I think you've got this one.</b>

18:51.715 --> 18:53.116
<b>- I'm really trying.</b>

18:53.116 --> 18:56.720
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b><b>â™ª</b>

18:56.720 --> 18:58.755
<b> <i>I grew up with a single mom</i> </b>

18:58.755 --> 19:01.424
<b> <i>in a rinky-dink trailer park.</i> </b>

19:01.424 --> 19:04.094
<b>My mother taught me that</b>
<b>if I want something,</b>

19:04.094 --> 19:05.662
<b> <i>I need to work for it.</i> </b>

19:05.662 --> 19:06.963
<b>I'm here to succeed.</b>

19:06.963 --> 19:09.799
<b>Guns blazing today,</b>
<b>guns blazing.</b>

19:09.799 --> 19:12.068
<b>- Team Peck,</b>
<b>this is your final hour.</b>

19:12.068 --> 19:14.070
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

19:14.070 --> 19:16.439
<b> <i>- I really didn't want to</i> </b>
<b> <i>do a watercolor.</i> </b>

19:16.439 --> 19:17.874
<b> <i>I like to do readable tattoos,</i> </b>

19:17.874 --> 19:20.777
<b>and watercolor tattoos are</b>
<b>not readable at all.</b>

19:20.777 --> 19:21.945
<b>- That's pretty cool.</b>

19:21.945 --> 19:23.313
<b>- Well, that's my goal.</b>

19:23.313 --> 19:25.916
<b>I don't do, normally, like,</b>
<b>watercolor this style.</b>

19:25.916 --> 19:27.684
<b> <i>I don't want to do</i> </b>
<b> <i>a crazy color,</i> </b>

19:27.684 --> 19:29.186
<b> <i>just going</i> </b>
<b> <i>outside of the lines.</i> </b>

19:29.186 --> 19:31.922
<b>So I'm doing a clean-ass</b>
<b>line work on this tattoo,</b>

19:31.922 --> 19:33.590
<b>making it look like pen and ink.</b>

19:33.590 --> 19:36.593
<b> <i>I'm just gonna try to go for</i> </b>
<b> <i>real splashes of watercolor</i> </b>

19:36.593 --> 19:38.261
<b>on this guy's skin.</b>

19:38.261 --> 19:39.262
<b>How's everybody doing?</b>

19:39.262 --> 19:40.597
<b>- I just saw Ryan's.</b>

19:40.597 --> 19:41.832
<b>- Ryan has a good outline?</b>

19:41.832 --> 19:43.700
<b>- Yes, but not like yours.</b>

19:43.700 --> 19:46.603
<b>Gian's line work is gorgeous.</b>

19:46.603 --> 19:51.608
<b>But watercolor tattooing</b>
<b>does not rely upon line work.</b>

19:51.608 --> 19:53.610
<b>- See how mine</b>
<b>stands up to hers.</b>

19:53.610 --> 19:55.278
<b>She's good.</b>

19:55.278 --> 19:57.981
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

19:57.981 --> 20:01.218

<b>two, one.</b>

20:03.119 --> 20:04.654
<b>That's it, machines down.</b>

<b>- Yeah, man, I like it.</b>

20:14.664 --> 20:15.932
<b>- Awesome.</b>

20:15.932 --> 20:17.667
<b>- Nate didn't end up doing</b>
<b>black and gray.</b>

20:17.667 --> 20:20.804
<b> <i>But his tattoo still</i> </b>
<b> <i>does not look like watercolor.</i> </b>

20:20.804 --> 20:22.539
<b> <i>All I can feel is confidence.</i> </b>

20:22.539 --> 20:24.174
<b> <i>I'm not worried about the boys.</i> </b>

20:24.174 --> 20:26.443
<b>They can duke it out tomorrow.</b>

20:37.015 --> 20:39.751
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

20:39.751 --> 20:42.987

<b>your tenth hour of tattooing.</b>

<b>And Kelly,</b>
<b>you secured the first spot</b>

20:45.056 --> 20:47.158
<b>in the live finale</b>
<b>for Team Nunez.</b>

20:47.158 --> 20:48.793
<b>Congratulations.</b>

20:48.793 --> 20:50.295
<b>Team Peck.</b>

20:50.295 --> 20:51.696
<b>You had to continue</b>
<b>in the marathon</b>

20:51.696 --> 20:53.932
<b>creating watercolor tattoos.</b>

20:53.932 --> 20:56.601
<b>Let's start with Nate.</b>

20:56.601 --> 20:58.436
<b>- First off,</b>
<b>it's a striking image.</b>

20:58.436 --> 21:00.638
<b> <i>It stands out,</i> </b>
<b> <i>definitely screams it's a tiger</i> </b>

21:00.638 --> 21:01.806
<b> <i>from any distance.</i> </b>

21:01.806 --> 21:03.708
<b>But as far as</b>
<b>the shape of the tiger,</b>

21:03.708 --> 21:05.476
<b> <i>the way you've ended</i> </b>
<b> <i>this tattoo,</i> </b>

21:05.476 --> 21:07.178
<b> <i>it kind of looks like</i> </b>
<b> <i>that purple splotch is</i> </b>

21:07.178 --> 21:08.713
<b> <i>supposed to be its ear.</i> </b>

21:08.713 --> 21:10.748
<b>But then there's not enough of</b>
<b>the back of the head</b>

21:10.748 --> 21:12.750
<b> <i>to really be the shape</i> </b>
<b> <i>of this tiger.</i> </b>

21:12.750 --> 21:14.619
<b> <i>That orange ends too soon,</i> </b>

21:14.619 --> 21:16.921
<b>'cause obviously his head</b>
<b>goes bigger in the back.</b>

21:16.921 --> 21:18.957
<b>- I treated it more like</b>
<b>a painting, I think.</b>

21:18.957 --> 21:21.492
<b> <i>- This reads more like</i> </b>
<b> <i>a tattoo of a tiger</i> </b>

21:21.492 --> 21:23.962
<b>that morphs into</b>
<b>watercolor areas.</b>

21:23.962 --> 21:27.765
<b>- I kind of was going for</b>
<b>that morph look a little bit.</b>

21:27.765 --> 21:30.468
<b>- Either way,</b>
<b>it's a killer tattoo from you.</b>

21:30.468 --> 21:31.469
<b>- Thanks.</b>

21:31.469 --> 21:33.271
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

21:33.271 --> 21:34.339
<b>- Gian.</b>

21:34.339 --> 21:36.207
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

21:36.207 --> 21:37.542
<b>- I love it.</b>

21:37.542 --> 21:38.476
<b> <i>It looks like a cool</i> </b>
<b> <i>pen-and-ink drawing</i> </b>

21:38.476 --> 21:39.944
<b> <i>with a hint of watercolor.</i> </b>

21:39.944 --> 21:41.879
<b> <i>The black like that you have</i> </b>
<b> <i>to represent the water,</i> </b>

21:41.879 --> 21:44.482
<b> <i>those pen and ink details</i> </b>
<b> <i>you did are beautiful.</i> </b>

21:44.482 --> 21:46.251
<b> <i>The shades of blue</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you have in the bottom</i> </b>

21:46.251 --> 21:48.019
<b>really does</b>
<b>look like watercolor.</b>

21:48.019 --> 21:51.289
<b>But as my eye moves up,</b>
<b>color choices in the sails,</b>

21:51.289 --> 21:54.125
<b> <i>chartreuse and yellow and brown</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the sails,</i> </b>

21:54.125 --> 21:55.660
<b>it's just strange.</b>

21:55.660 --> 21:57.262
<b>- I decided just going, like,</b>
<b>really muddy,</b>

21:57.262 --> 21:59.664
<b>and like</b>
<b>a broken down pirate ship.</b>

21:59.664 --> 22:01.266
<b>- The sails looks like a sheet</b>

22:01.266 --> 22:03.201
<b>somebody used for</b>
<b>paintball practice.</b>

22:03.201 --> 22:04.669
<b> <i>This tattoo doesn't have</i> </b>

22:04.669 --> 22:06.671
<b> <i>an overall finished,</i> </b>
<b> <i>artistic look.</i> </b>

22:06.671 --> 22:08.740
<b>It just looks like</b>
<b>the outline was already there,</b>

22:08.740 --> 22:10.341
<b>and then you spilled</b>
<b>a bunch of paint on it.</b>

22:10.341 --> 22:12.510
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

22:12.510 --> 22:13.511
<b>- Ryan.</b>

22:13.511 --> 22:15.847
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

22:15.847 --> 22:17.649
<b>- I like the use of</b>
<b>the rich black.</b>

22:17.649 --> 22:19.050
<b> <i>Really helps give this thing</i> </b>

22:19.050 --> 22:20.985
<b> <i>structure and dimension</i> </b>
<b> <i>and depth.</i> </b>

22:20.985 --> 22:23.288
<b> <i>You were able to achieve</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot of layers and detail</i> </b>

22:23.288 --> 22:24.789
<b> <i>just with color shading.</i> </b>

22:24.789 --> 22:27.926
<b> <i>I love the way the colors blend</i> </b>
<b> <i>from one to the next.</i> </b>

22:27.926 --> 22:29.994
<b>- The fins are what make</b>
<b>this tattoo, completely.</b>

22:29.994 --> 22:32.497
<b> <i>It's a very loose tattoo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but you really anchor it in</i> </b>

22:32.497 --> 22:34.666
<b> <i>with all the black you use</i> </b>
<b> <i>and the black shading.</i> </b>

22:34.666 --> 22:35.867
<b>It was a wise choice.</b>

22:35.867 --> 22:37.035
<b>- Thank you.</b>

22:37.035 --> 22:39.304
<b> <i>â™ª</i> </b>

22:39.304 --> 22:41.739
<b>- There are two spots left</b>
<b>in the live finale.</b>

22:41.739 --> 22:45.176
<b>It is time to decide who has</b>
<b>the best tattoo of the day</b>

22:45.176 --> 22:48.179
<b>and secures their spot</b>
<b>alongside Kelly.</b>

22:48.179 --> 22:49.914
<b>- Looking at</b>
<b>all three of these tattoos,</b>

22:49.914 --> 22:52.050
<b>the one that looks the weakest</b>
<b>to me is Gian's.</b>

22:52.050 --> 22:54.319
<b> <i>- Which is a shame,</i> </b>
<b> <i>because I love his drawing.</i> </b>

22:54.319 --> 22:56.888
<b> <i>- I know, it just turned into</i> </b>
<b> <i>one of those tattoos</i> </b>

22:56.888 --> 22:59.157
<b>that looks like a coloring book</b>
<b>where the outline was there,</b>

22:59.157 --> 23:01.960
<b>and then the kid just</b>
<b>spilled paint all over it.</b>

23:01.960 --> 23:04.829
<b>- The battle is definitely</b>
<b>between Nate and Ryan.</b>

23:04.829 --> 23:08.066
<b>- Ryan definitely could've upped</b>
<b>her color palette a little bit.</b>

23:08.066 --> 23:11.069
<b> <i>Would've been a lot more</i> </b>
<b> <i>appealing if it was brighter.</i> </b>

23:11.069 --> 23:13.671
<b> <i>Nate's choice to</i> </b>
<b> <i>put the purple in the stripes</i> </b>

23:13.671 --> 23:15.073
<b> <i>and have it blend to the orange</i> </b>

23:15.073 --> 23:17.075
<b> <i>gives you that</i> </b>
<b> <i>hot and cold play.</i> </b>

23:17.075 --> 23:18.776
<b>- I like Ryan's balance.</b>

23:18.776 --> 23:21.279
<b> <i>It's got so much heavy blue</i> </b>
<b> <i>towards the tail section</i> </b>

23:21.279 --> 23:23.781

23:28.720 --> 23:31.155
<b>And I think Ryan gets it today.</b>

23:31.155 --> 23:34.692
<b>- It's more along the line of</b>
<b>a finished piece of artwork.</b>

23:34.692 --> 23:36.127
<b>My vote's for Ryan.</b>

23:36.127 --> 23:37.462
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

23:37.462 --> 23:41.599
<b>The best tattoo of the day</b>

23:41.599 --> 23:42.967
<b>Congratulations, Ryan.</b>

23:42.967 --> 23:46.237
<b>You have earned your spot</b>

23:46.237 --> 23:48.206
<b>- Thank you so much.</b>

23:48.206 --> 23:50.208
<b>- It's a girl fight.</b>

23:50.208 --> 23:52.710
<b>Honestly, this has been</b>
<b>the strongest female presence</b>

23:52.710 --> 23:54.078

23:54.078 --> 23:55.280
<b>It's been awesome.</b>

23:55.280 --> 23:56.314
<b>But that's neither</b>

<b>Best tattoo wins,</b>

23:57.649 --> 23:59.484
<b>You've got to be ready</b>

23:59.484 --> 24:00.485

24:00.485 --> 24:02.387
<b>- Gian and Nate.</b>

24:02.387 --> 24:05.757
<b>There's only one spot left</b>
<b>in the live finale.</b>

24:05.757 --> 24:08.192
<b>That means one of you will</b>

24:08.192 --> 24:10.595
<b>against Kelly and Ryan,</b>

24:10.595 --> 24:12.830

24:12.830 --> 24:15.833
<b>It all comes down to</b>

24:15.833 --> 24:18.202
<b>a new-school landmark.</b>

24:18.202 --> 24:19.938

24:19.938 --> 24:21.706
<b>either one of you guys</b>
<b>going to this next challenge.</b>

24:21.706 --> 24:24.842
<b>I think it's gonna be equally as</b>
<b>challenging for both of you.</b>

24:24.842 --> 24:25.843
<b>- Let's see what you got.</b>

24:25.843 --> 24:27.812
<b>This is for the whole enchilada.</b>

24:27.812 --> 24:28.947

24:36.721 --> 24:38.289
<b>We are both in the finale.</b>

24:38.289 --> 24:40.725

24:40.725 --> 24:42.160

24:42.160 --> 24:44.329

24:47.966 --> 24:49.467

24:50.768 --> 24:52.537
<b>though, Nate or Gian?</b>

24:52.537 --> 24:54.706

<b>They're both capable of just</b>

28:09.093 --> 28:12.463

29:53.765 --> 29:55.266

29:55.266 --> 29:57.168
<b> <i>I really like the expression</i> </b>
<b> <i>in her face.</i> </b>

29:57.168 --> 29:59.437
<b> <i>She has the typical</i> </b>
<b> <i>new-school big eyes,</i> </b>

29:59.437 --> 30:02.073
<b> <i>but the ending of the tattoo is</i> </b>
<b> <i>my favorite part.</i> </b>

30:02.073 --> 30:04.442
<b> <i>The way that</i> </b>
<b> <i>that piece of robe comes across</i> </b>

30:04.442 --> 30:06.678
<b> <i>and gives us that open,</i> </b>
<b> <i>blowing shape</i> </b>

30:06.678 --> 30:10.515
<b>is a very nice way to end</b>
<b>the tattoo and keep it soft.</b>

30:10.515 --> 30:13.251
<b>- All the little details</b>
<b>really stand strong,</b>

30:13.251 --> 30:14.953
<b> <i>like the fingers</i> </b>
<b> <i>grasping the tablet.</i> </b>

30:14.953 --> 30:17.589

<b> <i>the top finger on the tablet.</i> </b>

30:17.589 --> 30:19.924
<b> <i>The shadow on the neck</i> </b>

<b>All these are expert tricks that</b>

30:37.141 --> 30:39.477
<b> <i>You have that detailed chain</i> </b>
<b> <i>at the bottom, breaking free,</i> </b>

<b> <i>symbolizing freedom</i> </b>
<b> <i>and liberty.</i> </b>

30:41.145 --> 30:42.914

<b>The little orange blast</b>

30:42.914 --> 30:44.616
<b> <i>behind it</i> </b>
<b> <i>pushes the aqua forward.</i> </b>

30:44.616 --> 30:46.951
<b> <i>The line weight that you use</i> </b>

<b> <i>really strong and really solid.</i> </b>

30:48.519 --> 30:50.955
<b> <i>You really punched the eyes in</i> </b>
<b> <i>with those heavy lines.</i> </b>

30:50.955 --> 30:52.357

30:52.357 --> 30:54.359
<b>only having one boob</b>
<b>that's sticking out</b>

30:54.359 --> 30:56.127
<b> <i>has a strange feel to it.</i> </b>

30:56.127 --> 30:58.830
<b>But you definitely did</b>
<b>a bright, vibrant tattoo.</b>

30:58.830 --> 30:59.898

<b>Judges, time to determine who</b>

31:14.379 --> 31:15.713

31:15.713 --> 31:18.449
<b> <i>- For me,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I love Gian's nose and lips</i> </b>

31:18.449 --> 31:20.518
<b> <i>way more than</i> </b>
<b> <i>Nate's nose and lips.</i> </b>

31:20.518 --> 31:21.886
<b>But I like Nate's eyes.</b>

31:21.886 --> 31:23.821

31:23.821 --> 31:26.391
<b> <i>over those lids into</i> </b>

31:27.392 --> 31:28.393
<b>- Oh, that part I like.</b>

31:28.393 --> 31:30.094
<b>- Nate has a nicer torch.</b>

31:30.094 --> 31:31.796
<b> <i>- More elaborate torch.</i> </b>

31:31.796 --> 31:33.264

<b>I don't know why</b>

31:41.139 --> 31:42.707

31:42.707 --> 31:44.209
<b>- Yeah, the light source.</b>

31:44.209 --> 31:48.413
<b>- I was thinking about it,</b>

31:48.413 --> 31:49.581

31:49.581 --> 31:50.715

31:50.715 --> 31:51.983

31:54.786 --> 31:58.389
<b>- She was telling me to do it,</b>

31:58.389 --> 32:00.058
<b>I just--I didn't.</b>

32:00.058 --> 32:01.192

32:01.192 --> 32:02.594
<b>They are two great tattoos</b>
