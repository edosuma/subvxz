02:54.891 --> 02:57.408
You wanna try?

03:10.590 --> 03:13.741
Lowen!

03:13.743 --> 03:17.429
Come this way.

03:53.333 --> 03:53.932
We are mortal.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.521
We need rest.

04:02.192 --> 04:04.359
Physically, emotionally,

04:05.946 --> 04:06.645
and spiritually.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.484
Life is a constant
state of unrest.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.221
A constant fight against sin,

04:17.223 --> 04:19.658
temptation, sickness, and pain.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.347
Then death.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.551
Yes, death is our sleep.

04:32.172 --> 04:36.557
A time for renewal, reflection,

04:36.559 --> 04:39.978
and internal peace.

04:52.408 --> 04:53.191
This is for you, Mama.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.792
Beth, I, I'm so sorry.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.517
To lose him like this.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.021
Oh God, Beth, you're so young.

05:26.493 --> 05:26.641
It just isn't right.

05:37.020 --> 05:38.119
I've spoken with some people
who can help with Lowen.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.593
Beth, you've got to know
you can't take care of him.

05:55.355 --> 05:55.754
Beth.

05:57.924 --> 06:01.976
Grandma?

06:01.978 --> 06:02.310
Oh.

06:09.402 --> 06:09.734
Don't touch him.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.707
I understand

06:15.709 --> 06:16.241
if you need to be
alone right now.

06:22.665 --> 06:23.531
Why don't you spend some
time at Shoal Harbor?

06:28.038 --> 06:29.037
It would do you good to
get back there for a while.

06:31.257 --> 06:31.673
Both of you.

06:34.711 --> 06:35.176
I'm selling your house, Mom.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.681
No one's living there, there's
no point in hanging on to it.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.267
I understand, sweetie.

06:46.206 --> 06:46.805
Just think about our
little boy right now.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.860
You have to keep a
level head for his sake.

06:56.649 --> 06:57.232
I know you're hurting.

07:01.204 --> 07:03.238
Honestly, Mom, I don't
feel anything at all.

07:09.512 --> 07:09.911
Come on.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.758
A boat, the boat.

07:25.262 --> 07:25.477
Yeah, come on.

07:36.139 --> 07:39.641
We're going to the
beach, pal, this way.

07:39.643 --> 07:39.741
This way.

07:51.621 --> 07:52.686
The 52!

07:54.707 --> 07:55.256
- 52 come by yet?
- What?

07:57.693 --> 07:59.427
- The 52.
- No, sorry.

07:59.429 --> 08:01.245
Don't know.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.715
Now ma'am, I've been
waitin' here over an hour,

08:03.717 --> 08:05.400
nothin's come by.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.918
They took her.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.387
I know they took her, Jerry.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.522
Believe me, the helicopter
came down and took her.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.642
Come on.

08:14.644 --> 08:14.709
Did you...

08:18.047 --> 08:20.064
Come on, no.

08:20.066 --> 08:20.615
- We are not...
- Did you see it?

08:24.037 --> 08:24.736
- The 52.
- No, we don't know.

08:24.738 --> 08:25.036
No, come, no.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.379
You, even they kidnapped
Jerry, oh my God.

08:35.448 --> 08:35.880
They kidnapped her!

08:53.633 --> 08:54.732
Thanks, one for you.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.305
Good throw, here's another.

09:07.046 --> 09:07.245
Hey.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.736
Oh oh.

09:24.247 --> 09:24.796
How would you like to
take a vacation, pal?

09:28.284 --> 09:28.883
At Grandma's old house,
just you and me.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.970
- Why not?
- I'm the 52

09:49.972 --> 09:50.872
may be comin' any minute.

09:53.743 --> 09:54.375
Oh my.

09:56.746 --> 09:59.180
So now I'll never get her.

09:59.182 --> 09:59.881
'Cause I can't swim,
and she's out there.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.645
We're goin'
to Grandam's house.

11:04.647 --> 11:07.264
Remember Grandma's house?

11:07.266 --> 11:07.982
This is the way.

11:13.823 --> 11:15.656
Gettin' there.

11:29.588 --> 11:29.804
We're here!

11:37.964 --> 11:40.181
All right.

11:40.183 --> 11:42.316
I can't wait
to go in the sea.

11:44.887 --> 11:45.236
It'll be fun.

11:52.162 --> 11:52.226
Ya.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.584
Come.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.084
Come on, come on.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.974
Oh, we're gonna go
inside for a sec.

12:06.976 --> 12:07.458
No, we'll go to the beach later.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.210
Come on.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.946
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

13:21.100 --> 13:21.699
Let's hold this one.

13:23.852 --> 13:24.785
How 'bout this one, Mom?

13:26.705 --> 13:28.405
Bedroom.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.340
- Bedroom.
- Mm hmm.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.728
- Bath.
- Bathroom.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.345
Bathroom.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.945
Hey Lowen, upstairs.

13:50.947 --> 13:51.445
Up!

14:24.097 --> 14:25.946
You like this room?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.331
It can be yours if you want.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.500
I want in
this room, no, hey.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.203
No.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.005
Uh oh.

14:35.007 --> 14:35.239
Uh oh.

15:07.857 --> 15:08.222
Check out the waves.

15:15.214 --> 15:15.646
That's the sea.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.469
That's the sea.

15:21.471 --> 15:22.370
That's the
edge of the world.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.741
Oh, that's the sea.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.617
I'm doing this.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.920
What are you
doing, no, don't do that.

16:36.378 --> 16:40.648
Where's Dad?

16:42.218 --> 16:42.700
Daddy's gone, honey.

16:45.688 --> 16:45.753
Daddy's gone?

16:51.461 --> 16:51.876
Remember what
happened to Black Fly?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.833
Black Fly got lost.

16:59.835 --> 17:00.051
Hmm.

17:03.238 --> 17:03.971
That's it, Daddy got lost.

17:08.461 --> 17:08.809
Will he come out?

17:11.829 --> 17:12.396
Will it come out?

17:18.988 --> 17:19.353
Wanna come out?

17:40.576 --> 17:41.375
Hey, you
eatin' your dinner?

17:43.012 --> 17:45.096
Mm mm.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.234
No, no, no, get into bed, hey.

17:52.337 --> 17:53.837
Yes, it's time to get into bed.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.893
Hurry up, come on.

18:06.935 --> 18:09.203
Wake up, Mom.

18:09.205 --> 18:09.703
Mm.

18:16.278 --> 18:18.412
What's that?

18:18.414 --> 18:19.213
I like this one.

18:22.050 --> 18:22.216
Mm.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.224
You awake, Ma?

18:34.296 --> 18:34.728
Wake up, Mom.

18:36.932 --> 18:37.231
Wake up.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.567
Wake up, Mom.

18:40.569 --> 18:40.734
Wake up.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.403
Okay,.

I didn't mean to intrude.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.618
I'm your neighbor, Joseph.

20:57.039 --> 20:58.205
Hi, Beth.

21:00.992 --> 21:01.325
And who's this
little gentleman?

21:04.129 --> 21:04.495
This is Lowen.

21:06.832 --> 21:06.997
Lowen.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.301
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.890
What beautiful golden hair.

21:18.894 --> 21:19.893
You must know my mother then?

21:22.097 --> 21:22.262
Not really.

21:24.666 --> 21:27.600
We're a quiet bunch around here.

21:27.602 --> 21:30.237
People mostly keep
to themselves.

21:30.239 --> 21:33.657
There's just so much space.

21:42.601 --> 21:43.334
It's quite a place, isn't it?

21:46.705 --> 21:50.040
Once you're here, it's
hard to leave.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.429
I've been tryin' to make
my escape for 20 years.

21:59.635 --> 22:01.634
It's beautiful.

22:01.636 --> 22:01.802
It's the water.

22:06.057 --> 22:08.225
The water here is
so special, Beth.

22:11.096 --> 22:11.161
Restorative.

22:15.133 --> 22:15.366
Awakens the spirit.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.738
Do you like swimming?

22:23.024 --> 22:25.959
I love going into the
ocean for a dip, I do.

22:27.479 --> 22:27.628
Wanna go?

22:29.465 --> 22:29.663
Yeah.

22:31.584 --> 22:31.799
Come on, let's go.

22:34.169 --> 22:36.736
Okay, come on, it's time
for your nap, partner.

22:36.738 --> 22:38.288
- No!
- Come on.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.322
No, no, no fair.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.058
I say.

22:44.729 --> 22:46.963
Oh, mother.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.573
Well, if you ever need
anything, a babysitter?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.895
I'm always here.

23:01.897 --> 23:04.047
Okay, well, it
was nice to meet you.

Hi.

24:09.982 --> 24:10.046
What are you drawing?

24:12.150 --> 24:12.649
I draw a tree.

24:15.437 --> 24:15.736
Oh, that's beautiful.

24:17.439 --> 24:19.306
Yeah, it is beautiful.

24:19.308 --> 24:19.490
See it all.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.113
Okay, pal,
you ready for bed?

24:26.115 --> 24:28.414
No!

24:28.416 --> 24:30.583
You're a big boy, you can
sleep in your own bed now.

24:30.585 --> 24:32.503
Come on up.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.930
No.

24:50.723 --> 24:51.805
I can, I saw a sea.

26:53.429 --> 26:53.560
Huh?

27:03.021 --> 27:03.270
Hello?

27:08.710 --> 27:08.909
Hello?

27:19.788 --> 27:19.920
Hello?

27:31.366 --> 27:31.932
Anybody out here?

27:49.918 --> 27:50.450
Mama?

28:25.170 --> 28:25.819
Hey, Lowen, stay
where I can see you.

28:28.890 --> 28:29.322
Okay.

28:31.492 --> 28:35.495
These are for my
outfit.

28:41.769 --> 28:42.836
Look, Mom, all the birds.

28:46.825 --> 28:47.758
Why do they go away?

28:52.880 --> 28:53.263
Come back here,

28:56.735 --> 28:59.201
come back here.

29:22.928 --> 29:23.293
Lowen.

29:26.865 --> 29:27.297
Lowen?

29:31.670 --> 29:31.802
Lowen!

29:39.978 --> 29:40.310
Lowen!

29:51.156 --> 29:52.022
Lowen, you gotta stay close.

29:58.346 --> 29:59.579
I want the ring.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.168
Can you put
you foot in for me?

30:07.839 --> 30:08.121
- Mm hmm.
- Push it in.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.275
A ladybug.

30:13.277 --> 30:14.010
- Look.
- That's a snail.

30:16.998 --> 30:21.551
- What is snail.
- Oh, it's a hermit crab.

30:21.553 --> 30:21.617
It's a bug.

30:26.307 --> 30:27.841
Yeah, he took that
shell from a little snail

30:27.843 --> 30:28.475
and now it's his home.

30:31.696 --> 30:32.112
Ooh.

30:34.649 --> 30:34.898
Ooh, yuck.

30:37.636 --> 30:37.734
Ooh, yuck!

30:41.072 --> 30:41.655
I don't like that.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.077
Huh.

30:57.038 --> 30:58.638
Come on, Lowen, let's go inside.

31:23.982 --> 31:27.433
No, what
are you doing?

31:27.435 --> 31:29.319
I'm doing
some marbling.

31:29.321 --> 31:33.023
You're
doing some marbling?

31:33.025 --> 31:34.758
That's right,
careful though.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.129
- What's that?
- That's carrageenan.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.350
That's care-a-geen?

31:45.770 --> 31:47.420
It's made from seaweed.

31:47.422 --> 31:48.788
We use it 'cause it's heavy

31:48.790 --> 31:49.389
and helps the paint
float to the top.

32:05.206 --> 32:06.990
Oh, don't touch, not yet.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.460
We're not doing paint yet.

32:11.462 --> 32:12.495
Mm hmm.

32:12.497 --> 32:14.430
What about black?

32:14.432 --> 32:15.165
It definitely
needs black.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.369
Oh.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.287
- They look good together?
- Yeah.

32:21.289 --> 32:22.422
Three, four, six, seven.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.542
Six.

32:26.544 --> 32:27.310
Wanna shake
that one for me, please?

32:28.996 --> 32:31.647
Oh, paint something.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.282
We're gonna paint
something, that's right.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.434
Yeah, we
gonna paint something.

32:38.306 --> 32:40.489
How 'bout some red?

32:40.491 --> 32:43.459
Yeah, add
some red paint.

32:43.461 --> 32:47.113
Grandmommy, some yellow?

32:49.550 --> 32:49.615
Oh, good.

32:51.886 --> 32:52.252
Some paint
on the brush here.

32:55.690 --> 32:55.789
Use your finger.

32:57.542 --> 32:57.607
Oh, wow.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.096
And this is the
rake; it makes the pattern.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.552
Rake, that's a rake?

33:09.554 --> 33:11.855
Mm hmm.

33:11.857 --> 33:14.056
Can I use that?

33:14.058 --> 33:15.958
Nope,
don't touch, baby.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.177
What color's that?

33:18.179 --> 33:18.645
That's dark gray.

33:23.117 --> 33:25.084
- Good painting.
- You like that?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.753
I like it.

33:26.755 --> 33:29.472
I think we're done.

33:29.474 --> 33:29.538
Dip it.

33:33.978 --> 33:34.127
Oh.

33:36.347 --> 33:36.796
There it is.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.733
Isn't that pretty?

33:42.621 --> 33:42.919
Huh?

33:46.107 --> 33:46.506
Yeah.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.742
Huh.

34:08.563 --> 34:12.364
Ah, Lowen!

35:12.326 --> 35:13.560
I don't like that.

35:35.166 --> 35:35.365
Whoa.

35:37.635 --> 35:38.868
Wow, there was a bicycle.

35:42.690 --> 35:42.755
Uh oh.

35:44.859 --> 35:45.124
Uh uh uh.

36:30.822 --> 36:34.390
Are you Black Fly?

36:34.392 --> 36:34.891
No Black Fly, no.

36:45.052 --> 36:45.268
Lowen?

36:53.344 --> 36:53.610
A bike.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.437
Check out the dancers,
what's he playing?

37:23.274 --> 37:25.541
What's he playing with?

37:25.543 --> 37:29.979
- He's playing music.
- He's playing music.

37:29.981 --> 37:33.149
The hills are not as high,
the seas so deep as a dream.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.402
What's she doing?

37:36.404 --> 37:38.037
She's flying.

37:38.039 --> 37:38.538
What's that?

37:40.408 --> 37:42.074
Girl.

37:42.076 --> 37:43.442
Girl.

37:43.444 --> 37:43.876
- A girl.
- A cocoa.

37:47.382 --> 37:51.768
In haste to chase
Jack Hare jumps dog rose,

37:51.770 --> 37:54.904
blushing petals tumble upon air.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.557
He got stuck in the
orange florence.

37:59.928 --> 38:00.760
That's okay, I
bet he gets out.

38:06.533 --> 38:06.849
He's scary.

38:10.721 --> 38:11.070
Look at all the monsters.

38:14.943 --> 38:15.742
Yeah, I think
that's too old for you.

38:19.313 --> 38:21.564
No, that's not.

38:21.566 --> 38:23.533
Yeah, let's
do a different book.

39:13.668 --> 39:14.300
Mom?

39:22.910 --> 39:22.975
Over here.

39:50.905 --> 39:52.722
Are you okay, Mom?

39:52.724 --> 39:55.324
Are you okay Mom?

39:57.078 --> 39:57.760
Are you all right?

40:08.205 --> 40:09.555
Mom, what's going on, Mom?

40:15.663 --> 40:16.562
Wait, don't go.

40:19.316 --> 40:21.067
Look out, what's happening Mom?

40:24.772 --> 40:25.905
What's happening, Mom?

40:31.278 --> 40:33.779
What's happening, Mom?

40:33.781 --> 40:36.949
Mom?

40:36.951 --> 40:39.185
Lowen.

41:20.328 --> 41:21.544
Are you going to be okay?

41:27.418 --> 41:28.601
You know do, you know how to do.

41:33.975 --> 41:34.941
I wanna go on the beach.

41:37.678 --> 41:40.095
Are we goin' to the beach, Mom?

41:40.097 --> 41:42.698
Yep, in a bit, we're
just gonna look at this thing.

41:49.991 --> 41:54.309
Mm.

42:03.320 --> 42:03.753

42:05.623 --> 42:05.755
A bug.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.145
It's a moth.

42:13.147 --> 42:16.349
It's a moth,
what is a moth in there?

42:16.351 --> 42:16.849
'Cause bugs like light.

42:33.985 --> 42:34.116

Hi.

45:08.563 --> 45:08.636
This is Sam.

I'm Sam.

45:13.260 --> 45:13.492
Hello.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.947
Are you living in
the Crescent House now?

45:22.352 --> 45:25.420
Yeah, for a while, I
don't know for how long.

45:25.422 --> 45:28.173
Why do you call it
the Crescent House?

45:28.175 --> 45:28.924
That's the Crescent,
way out there.

45:31.912 --> 45:34.179
It's a rock shelf
under the water.

45:34.181 --> 45:35.014
Goes all the way around
the whole ville.

45:38.052 --> 45:40.052
It caused a lot of
shipwrecks in the old days.

45:42.256 --> 45:42.772
Keeps the water warm, though.

45:50.314 --> 45:52.081
And do you live around here?

45:52.083 --> 45:53.482
Close by, but this
is my favorite spot.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.789
Thought I'd pick up some trash
today, I sometimes do that.

46:02.542 --> 46:02.875
Lowen.

46:06.330 --> 46:09.481
I think you'll like it
here, the people are nice.

46:09.483 --> 46:11.000
But there are a few you
should watch out for.

46:13.754 --> 46:14.086
Watch out for who?

46:19.276 --> 46:20.509
Dead folk who don't
wanna stay dead.

46:25.332 --> 46:27.633
They've been watching your son.

46:27.635 --> 46:28.017
Who's been watching us?

47:17.935 --> 47:19.201
What are you doing?

47:41.325 --> 47:44.259
Lowen, dinner.

47:44.261 --> 47:45.844
I don't want dinner.

47:51.768 --> 47:51.850
Lowen?

47:54.054 --> 47:54.937
So tasty.

47:56.724 --> 47:57.156
- So...
- Hello.

47:59.143 --> 47:59.742
Yeah.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.683
I'm playing with Black Fly, Mom.

48:15.108 --> 48:17.426
That's not Black
Fly, sweetheart.

48:17.428 --> 48:19.978

50:54.385 --> 50:55.084
Hello?

50:56.987 --> 51:00.205

51:00.207 --> 51:00.706
No.

51:02.309 --> 51:02.958
How did
you get in here?

51:07.965 --> 51:09.298
Must be so devastating
to lose a loved one.

51:12.786 --> 51:13.385

husband deeply.

51:46.370 --> 51:49.037

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:04.008
She's okay.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:07.428
What's this brush?

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.300
Is Mom tired?

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:13.350
She is.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:31.318
It's too late for you, the
water won't take you back.

01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:38.769
Lowen.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:46.193
Lowen?

01:17:49.314 --> 01:17:49.646
Lowen.

01:18:00.892 --> 01:18:01.158
Lowen?

01:18:26.218 --> 01:18:27.417
Lowen?

01:18:34.059 --> 01:18:34.358
Where's my son?

01:18:36.928 --> 01:18:37.995
What did you do with
him, he's just so...

01:18:41.766 --> 01:18:43.000
Good, you're up.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.524
I didn't wanna wake you.

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:51.291
What the fuck?

01:18:53.011 --> 01:18:53.343
Where is he?

01:18:55.848 --> 01:18:57.781
He's gone, I'm afraid.

01:18:57.783 --> 01:18:58.182
Where is he?

01:19:00.352 --> 01:19:00.417
Stay back.

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:05.288
I said stay back.

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:05.722
Yeah.

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:10.527
Put the stick down.

01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:15.531
No, I said stay
back.

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:17.067
Why don't
you give the cane?

01:19:17.069 --> 01:19:17.701
Where is he?

01:19:19.438 --> 01:19:24.107
Huh?

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:28.078
Where is he?

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:34.051
Where's Lowen?

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:36.920
Lowen.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:38.955
This is...

01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:47.747
Oh.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:47.931
You never know

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.353
how rich life is until
you've lost it.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.514
Once you've lived as
many times as I have,

01:20:04.516 --> 01:20:05.282
you begin to realize

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.787
there are ways to get it back.

01:20:16.528 --> 01:20:18.528
Let's get on with it.

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.629
Oh God.

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:23.550
I'm dead, you're dead.

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:24.017
Everyone's dead.

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:30.274
We're all stuck here in this
everlasting nothingness.

01:20:34.947 --> 01:20:37.364
Now your little
boy, he isn't dead.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:40.901
Not yet.

01:20:43.489 --> 01:20:44.788
That's why I need
the little critter.

01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:47.791
He's my way back.

01:20:51.997 --> 01:20:54.464
You know by now you can't
just float on out of here.

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:56.967
You need a vessel.

01:20:59.737 --> 01:21:00.470
If you wait around long enough,

01:21:02.774 --> 01:21:04.474
one will come sailing by.

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.010
Please just tell
me where he is.

01:21:10.749 --> 01:21:11.148
They've taken him.

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:17.237
But if we help each other,
we can get him back.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:20.941
All I want is his body.

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.079
You can keep the rest of him.

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:31.901
No.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.504
Beneath the
,

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:53.790
that's what you want, Beth.

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:55.859
You know we can be
together, forever.

01:22:40.105 --> 01:22:40.404
Lowen?

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.042
Mommy.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.047
I got to go in the water, Mom.

01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:47.070
We gotta go, Mom.

01:23:47.072 --> 01:23:47.921
Gonna go in the water.

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:04.438
It's okay, sweetie.

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:06.440
You can go.

01:24:24.242 --> 01:24:24.708
Mm.

01:24:51.819 --> 01:24:52.152
No.

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.456
I'm with you, Mom.

01:25:34.245 --> 01:25:34.611
Mommy.

01:26:57.328 --> 01:26:57.661
Bright lights.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:01.665
Look at the lights on there.

01:27:08.873 --> 01:27:09.623
Head up, I don't
wanna get your chin.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.392
Is that too tight?

01:27:16.781 --> 01:27:18.114
You okay?

01:27:18.116 --> 01:27:18.214
Do you wanna go on your bum?

01:27:19.584 --> 01:27:19.716
I got your hand.

01:27:21.753 --> 01:27:25.188
Come on, slowpokes, get on in.

01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:25.555
- Thanks.
- Hey, pal.

01:27:28.993 --> 01:27:29.092
Thank you.

01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:41.321
You know, we don't have
to sell the place.

01:27:45.277 --> 01:27:47.176
Yeah.

01:27:47.178 --> 01:27:50.046
Come on, let's see if we
can get this thing working.

01:27:50.048 --> 01:27:50.580
I don't know if it's
ever been used before.

01:28:00.225 --> 01:28:01.724
There are paddles.

01:28:01.726 --> 01:28:02.425
Put him the
other way around.

How come we stopped?

01:29:01.886 --> 01:29:03.686
I just wanna
float for a while.

01:29:03.688 --> 01:29:06.255
You do
this when you float?

01:29:06.257 --> 01:29:07.656
Mm hmm.

01:29:07.658 --> 01:29:08.992
I wanna go faster.

01:29:13.631 --> 01:29:15.331
This was a terrible idea.

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:15.832
We shouldn't have come out here.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:20.637
No, you were
right, this is nice.

01:29:26.545 --> 01:29:26.676
I needed this.

01:29:35.386 --> 01:29:38.071
Okay, stop.

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:40.139
I don't get to see out
of the studio that often,

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.241
I want to remember what
you look like in the light.

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.944
Okay, burn it into your mind.

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:54.737
I wanna
take a picture, Dad.

01:29:54.739 --> 01:29:57.173
You wanna take
a picture, all right.

01:29:57.175 --> 01:29:59.158
Here, lemme help
you with that.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.660
What do you wanna
take a picture of?

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:00.927
Dad.

01:30:02.531 --> 01:30:02.929
Okay.

01:30:04.582 --> 01:30:04.931
Here, lift it up.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.436
- All right, Ben, smile, Ben.
- I am smiling.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.730
We could take another.

01:30:20.732 --> 01:30:22.298
Here it comes.

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:24.700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:30:24.702 --> 01:30:24.868
Okay, one left, ooh.

01:30:27.038 --> 01:30:27.103
One left.

01:30:29.274 --> 01:30:30.440
- Try it.
- Ready?

01:30:30.442 --> 01:30:30.540

Oh, that's a keeper.

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:48.675
Oh, it's blue.

01:30:48.677 --> 01:30:50.242
Okay, let's put these in here.

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.629
They'll be ready when
we get back to town.

01:30:52.631 --> 01:30:53.730

won't go any faster?
