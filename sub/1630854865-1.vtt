00:34.451 --> 00:36.036
Stay down, please.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.748
Sir, down.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.127
Brace!

00:52.678 --> 00:53.971
Stay down.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.767
Sit down. Stay down!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.102
Stay down!

01:02.479 --> 01:03.897
Brace!

01:05.065 --> 01:06.608
Stop. Stay down.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.155
Everyone down!

01:13.532 --> 01:14.783
Brace.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.076
Brace!

01:25.335 --> 01:26.420
Come on. Pick up the pace.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.380
What are you doing?
-I'm trying to.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.970
See ya, sucker.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.389
Hey! Eddie.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.400
See you, loser.
-Oh, my-- Hey! Walk your bike.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.200
See that?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.120
Can't believe you beat me.
-It's okay. You'll catch up one day.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.164
I will?
-Probably not.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.832
Hello, boys.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.960
Hey, Faakhir.
-Two falafel, extra tahina?

02:06.960 --> 02:10.214
Yeah, one with no radish the other with--
-The other, no onions.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.798
And two black cherry sodas.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.717
Out of black cherry.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.303
What?
-Black cherry on Wednesday.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.806
Wednesday's too late.
-It's okay.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.059
Two root beers.
-Jordan.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.104
This is literally our last falafel
before we leave New York forever.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.315
And he's out of black cherry.
It's not the same.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.399
Eddie, it's cool.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.152
You think LA has decent falafels?

02:33.070 --> 02:36.823
If they do,
I'm sure we'll find them, okay?

02:38.450 --> 02:41.036
Hey, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.081
What?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.166
Here you go, boys.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.669
Two root beer.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.923
And two of the best falafel in New York.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.383
Thanks, Faakhir.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.177
Thank you, Faakhir.
-Thank you. See you boys soon.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.262
Bye, Faakhir.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.347
Hey, what were you about to say?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.474
Nothing. Let's eat.

03:18.782 --> 03:22.286
Don't forget to call ahead to the hotel.
Make sure they have my room ready.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.246
Last time they screwed up.
-I will.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.373
And tell Stuart that--
-That he's running the meeting?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.876
Just tell him to start the meeting,
and I'll call into it.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.544
Yeah.
-Is the flight delayed?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.546
There's weather in the southwest,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.423
but they don't think
it should delay takeoff.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.134
Just what I need, a bumpy flight.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.136
Okay.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.728
Tell Cora not to forget about the call.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.854
Yeah.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.899
Will you text me my--
-Your boarding pass. You should have it.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.443
Okay.
-All right.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.737
I'll be back on Thursday.
-I know.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.364
Another LA fundraising trip.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.117
Hey, listen, about the other night.
-Uh-huh.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.661
I really appreciate everything you said.
-Yea-- Uh-huh.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.038
And so honored, really.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.332
But I've just been thinking about it
a little bit...

04:08.332 --> 04:10.834
Uh-huh.
-...and I'm giving my notice.

04:10.834 --> 04:11.919
What?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.962
Well, there's nothing you can say.
-Come on.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.380
Wait, but--
-Come on.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.923
Amanda, please.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.511
Boys! Would you please
come back here and help with the luggage?

04:20.511 --> 04:21.845
Geez, all right.
-Right, sorry.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.598
Thank you for participating.
We've raised animals.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.391
Did you bring the Switch?
-Yes.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.519
And the charger?
-Of course.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.728
You have everything?

04:29.728 --> 04:32.606
Do you have his workbooks?
-Yeah, they're in their backpacks.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.233
We are actually doing this.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.317
It'll be great.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.362
I'm dying for a coffee. Yeah.
-Coffee?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.655
You guys hungry?

04:40.239 --> 04:41.782
Eddie?
-What do you wanna get?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.867
Hey, why'd you get the little bag?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.880
Hey, hi. Do you mind?
-No, of course.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.554
Hey, sorry, can you take this?

05:04.054 --> 05:05.055
Thank you.
-Okay.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.102
Hi.
-Hi.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.940
My beautiful birthday baby.
-Yeah.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.817
What are you wearing?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.861
I-- You know, I have a lot of schoolwork.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.405
It's-- I was working.
-Okay. You're delicious.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.491
You're a twig. Did you lose more weight?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.743
I don't know, Mom. I don't know.
-Stop doing that.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.872
Hi.
-Thank you, Christopher.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.373
Sure.
-Here's the birthday girl.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.375
Well, one of the birthday girls
because we share.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.252
Yeah. Which has caused a lot of trauma.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.629
She's so funny.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.592
We've been coming here
since Zoe was five years old,

05:41.592 --> 05:43.135
every year for our birthday.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.931
And Christopher
is up-and-coming in the theater,

05:47.931 --> 05:49.224
working in--

05:49.892 --> 05:51.768
Set design. Yes.
-Mom, can you let him work?

05:51.768 --> 05:54.396
Is she glomming? She gloms.
-No, not at all.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.064
May I get you
something to get started with?

05:56.064 --> 05:58.650
Oh, yes. We always start
with the osetra caviar, please,

05:58.650 --> 06:00.611
and the foie gras. Sorry, ducks.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.821
I'm salivating. Are you salivating?

06:02.821 --> 06:05.574
And a bottle of Cristal, please.
-Yes, and a bottle of Cristal.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.619
We've been sneaking it since she was 18,
and they don't mind here.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.746
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
-Oh, no you didn't.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.498
I'll get that right out to you ladies.
-Thank you.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.418
He's so cute.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.337
Oh, my God, I love him.
-Mom.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.464
You could date him.
-Are you-- Okay.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.382
I mean, I don't know.
Do you think he's gay?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.467
He works in the theater.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.676
Or you're gay, I don't know.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.886
I'm sorry, that's rude.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.055
You can be gay, straight, whatever.
Honey, I don't care,

06:28.055 --> 06:29.640
you be whoever you want--
-Okay, can we...

06:29.640 --> 06:31.767
Yes, let's change the subject. Hi.
-Yeah.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.310
Hi.
-Hi.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.394
Happy birthday.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.232
Can't believe Dad isn't here.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.192
I know. He's devastated.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.444
He can't believe
he's missing it this year either.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.571
You know what he did though?
The cutest thing.

06:44.571 --> 06:49.117
He called Luis at Valentino
and made us an appointment on the 3rd for...

06:49.117 --> 06:50.994
Oh, my God.
-...shopping spree.

06:50.994 --> 06:51.954
Yeah.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.289
Birthday.
-Wait, no. I can't.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.625
I have a paper due tomorrow, Mom.
I can't go.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.710
No. Oh, come on.
-No.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.795
This is our day.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.171
It's really crazy.
-I sent an itinerary.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.381
I know.
-Do you read my texts?

07:02.381 --> 07:05.050
It's hard to keep up with your texts, Mom.
You're very verbose.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.760
Well, you're not very good at responding,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.887
so I never know if you've read it--
-Hi.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.806
Oh, there it is.
-That's the one.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.182
Actually, will you do us a favor?

07:12.182 --> 07:14.059
Sure.
-Would you take a quick pic of us?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.644
No.
-Yes.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.021
I'm a mess. Mom, can we not?
-You're not a mess.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.439
Don't be a mess.
-I don't wanna take a picture.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.859
Your father will literally kill me
if I don't document.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.026
Well, I-- Okay.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.112
Okay, thank you so much.
That should be all set.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.655
To Christopher.
-Sorry.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.490
Look at this gorgeous creature.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.534
No. That's not happening right now.
-All right.

07:30.534 --> 07:31.451
Ready?
-Just a little--

07:31.451 --> 07:33.161
Can you not touch my hair?
-It's just some--

07:33.161 --> 07:34.788
Rebellious strands.
-Can you get off my fucking--

07:34.788 --> 07:35.914
Please don't touch my hair.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.708
A few rebellious strands.
-Can you get the fuck off my hair?

07:37.708 --> 07:38.917
Oh, my God.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.544
Okay, I think I got it.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.754
Oh, good. Thank you.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.131
It's horrifying.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.592
Thank you, Christopher. I love it.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.471
All right, you're good. Come on.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.600
Keep moving. Come on. Hands up.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.227
You got your computer, honey?
-Yeah, it's right here.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.188
You're good to go.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.898
Eddie, do you have your boarding pass?

08:00.898 --> 08:03.483
I have his boarding pass.
-Shoes off.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.152
Laptops out.
-I have yours.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.030
If we keep going I'm gonna miss my flight.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.448
I'm okay with that.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.616
I don't wanna leave you.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.951
I know. But you have to.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.453
I'm gonna be there so soon.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.582
Love you.
-Love you too, mama.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.919
Good afternoon.
Trinity Airways flight 1483

08:21.919 --> 08:23.962
bound for Los Angeles
will be boarding shortly.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.925
Trinity Airways flight 1483
bound for Los Angeles...

08:27.925 --> 08:29.468
What if we hate it in California?

08:31.303 --> 08:36.433
Honey, you know your dad and I
would never make this decision

08:36.433 --> 08:38.894
if we didn't think
you were gonna love it in LA.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.855
Right?
-Absolutely.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.025
And we're only renting
our New York apartment for one year.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.236
If it doesn't work out
we can always come home.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.487
But that's not the plan.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.697
Right, not the plan.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.576
We'll love LA. We will. Go Dodgers.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.079
This is our gate.

08:58.830 --> 08:59.831
Hey.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.210
It's gonna be great, I promise.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.005
Yeah.

09:08.924 --> 09:09.925
Okay.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.009
Come on, sweetie.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.149
Sweetie, you okay?
-Okay.

09:26.942 --> 09:27.943
Yeah.
-Good.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.368
Hey, I think that one took.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.329
I think we might be back in the game.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.083
I've gotta get back on the decaf.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.627
You know, you say that every day.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.423
I'm gonna be home early tonight.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.466
Before you leave for your shift.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.634
Cool.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.137
It's the big day, right?
Did they get to the airport?

09:56.555 --> 09:58.682
I haven't heard.
-Really?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.476
Man,
I can't believe they're really doing it.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.812
Yeah, I know.

10:04.980 --> 10:05.981
Crazy.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.692
Oh, babe.

10:08.692 --> 10:13.071
God! Honey,
this doorknob is literally killing me.

10:13.071 --> 10:13.989
Oh, yeah.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.241
I was meaning to take a look at that.
-It's a safety hazard.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.952
Well, it's not.
But yeah, I'll tighten it up.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.121
Hey, listen, can we just--
-Thank you. Yeah?

10:22.331 --> 10:23.540
Morning, Shay.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.625
Hi, Ms. Curtis.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.793
Strange girl.

10:27.586 --> 10:30.964
Yeah, I was thinking about what
Dr. Berkowitz was saying the other day--

10:30.964 --> 10:32.382
Berkowitz is an asshole.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.594
Well, okay.
-Really, the hell with him. The audacity.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.387
Yeah, I think maybe he's just trying to...

10:37.387 --> 10:39.765
Fuck fucking Berkowitz.
-...you know, open-- I mean--

10:39.765 --> 10:40.849
I mean, you're--

10:41.725 --> 10:45.896
You're great, I'm great,
we're great, you know? Okay?

10:45.896 --> 10:47.439
I love you. I gotta go.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.649
I love you too.
-Bye, Shay.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.400
Bye.
-Love to your mom.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.653
I'm good.
-Good catch.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.038
Nice.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.125
Thank you.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.337
Mom, this is first class.
What are you doing?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.630
Don't worry, it's okay.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.881
They're with me.
-Okay.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.427
Guys, I have something to tell you.
We're not gonna get to fly together.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.096
What do you mean?

11:19.096 --> 11:22.182
You know how the studio flew me out?
So, I'm in first class.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.518
You're in first class?
You're just the writer.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.563
All the way down. Thank you.
-Thank you.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.481
Hi.
-Hi, good morning. Welcome aboard.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.025
Okay, straight down on your left.
-Thank you.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.654
Anyway, I was gonna try and change
my seat, so I could fly with you guys,

11:35.654 --> 11:38.156
but I was so distracted last week
by the move.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.493
So I'm just gonna sit up here
and get the script finished.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.537
Will you bring us dessert?
-Of course I will.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.746
I'm gonna miss you guys.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.249
Okay, Mom,
we're gonna be, like, 50 feet away.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.750
Enjoy your flight.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.502
No hug? Nothing.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.254
Okay.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.632
I told you they wouldn't be upset.
-Yeah, no big deal.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.886
We're just moving across
the continent together for your job.

11:58.886 --> 12:02.389
And I see no symbolism in the fact that
you're sitting in a different class.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.891
Bruce.
-I'm kidding.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.643
Is that a lie-back seat? It's very nice.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.395
I hate you.
-I hate you too.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.566
Good morning.
Welcome aboard. Hi, good morning.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.860
Can you get my bag?
-Hey, Eddie.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.237
What?
-What are you doing? Window seat's mine.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.824
No, when we went to Costa Rica, we said
next time we flew, I'd get the window.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.492
Yeah, that was like two years ago.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.412
So what?
-So, the window seat has my name on it.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.873
You can have it
when we fly back to New York, okay?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.666
What if we never fly back to New York?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.588
Whatever. Stand up. Rock, paper, scissors.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.507
Fine.
-Best two out of three.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.008
Sure.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.219
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.013
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.432
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.351
Paper covers rock.
-You suck.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.312
Yeah, these seats are way better.
-Till next Thursday?

12:50.312 --> 12:53.607
Can I--
May I borrow $30 till next Thursday?

12:55.192 --> 12:56.193
Yeah.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.861
Let me help you.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.404
Right.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.658
Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.120
...till next Thursday?

13:07.913 --> 13:11.583
May I borrow $30 till next Thursday?

13:12.543 --> 13:18.674
May I borrow $30 till next Thursday?
May I borrow $30 till next Thursday?

13:18.674 --> 13:20.008
That is terrible.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.513
Your acting has gotten very bad.
Who are you trying to play, Akua?

13:24.513 --> 13:28.100
I'm trying to sound like a heroin addict.
-Hey, listen,

13:28.100 --> 13:31.061
if you are playing a drug addict,
please use your American accent.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.688
Don't put that on us.

13:32.688 --> 13:35.023
The part calls for a Ghanaian actress.

13:35.023 --> 13:39.027
That's the whole reason they're
flying me out to audition for Spike Jonze.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.197
Chale, Spike Jonze? That's big time...

13:42.197 --> 13:45.284
See, Kojo? Even Albert gets it.

13:45.284 --> 13:47.661
Why are you begging
to act in American movies?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.413
Chale, come home and work for me.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.039
Renting out porta-potties?

13:55.419 --> 13:58.088
Business is booming, though.
Albert, tell her.

13:58.088 --> 14:01.300
Me say, everyone wants...
-Porta-potties yesterday.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.718
You see that?

14:02.718 --> 14:04.428
Sister, come home.

14:04.428 --> 14:05.888
Be part of the family empire.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.725
Kojo, this is my dream.
You have to start somewhere.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.602
But you can act here.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.563
You can even become the next--
What's that beautiful woman?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.941
Jackie Appiah.
-Jackie Appiah. Uh-huh.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.568
Mommy, can I watch a show?

14:19.568 --> 14:21.361
No more screen time, boo-boo.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.864
I have to go.
You're not helping me anyway.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.782
Wait a second, is that my Becks?

14:26.283 --> 14:27.367
Hello, my darling.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.621
Listen, tell your mother
to bring you home to Ghana, okay?

14:31.163 --> 14:32.623
Say, "Hello, Uncle Kojo."

14:32.623 --> 14:34.041
Hi, Uncle Kojo.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.584
Hello, my niece.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.086
Okay, gotta go. Love you.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.838
Please take your seat.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.591
Fasten your seat belt, please.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.551
Okay.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.347
Excuse me, ma'am?
-Yeah, everything okay?

14:48.347 --> 14:51.308
Could I get a beer when you get a chance?
-I can bring it right after we take off?

14:51.308 --> 14:52.726
Great. Appreciate it.
-Course.

14:53.644 --> 14:54.895
I got something for ya.

14:56.438 --> 14:57.439
Here you go, boys.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.524
What?

14:58.524 --> 15:00.943
You're seriously gonna make us
do school work on the plane?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.194
It's a weekday.

15:02.194 --> 15:05.447
And luckily, you have your teacher
right here on the plane with you.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.532
That's depraved, Dad.

15:06.532 --> 15:09.993
You are actually a monster.
-It'll help pass the time.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.496
Oh, gosh, sorry.
-Sorry.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.542
This is me. Thank you.
-Sure.

15:18.544 --> 15:21.421
Okay, this is Trinity 1483.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.466
We are clear for takeoff. JFK 22-Left.

15:24.466 --> 15:27.553
Takeoff check. Flaps are at two and two.

15:27.553 --> 15:31.181
Remote control panel is set.
220 heading. 4,000 feet.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.850
Auto-throttle is armed.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.643
We're clear for takeoff.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.031
All right, I'm done.
Can I go to the next one?

15:48.031 --> 15:50.534
Just hold on.
Your brother's not quite finished yet.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.618
Okay.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.289
Take another look.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.209
See if you can figure out
where you went wrong.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.170
You got it 90% correct.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.299
Ninety's good. It's like an A-minus.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.092
Shut up.
-Eddie, please.

16:07.801 --> 16:11.180
You know this.
We were working on this all yesterday.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.182
Don't push him.
-He knows this.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.190
You forgot to isolate the X--
-Would you shut the fuck up, Eddie?

16:21.190 --> 16:22.232
Okay.
-Excuse me?

16:22.232 --> 16:23.567
Calm down.
-I was trying to help.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.110
I asked you not to talk like that.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.613
Of course it's my fault.
It's never Eddie's.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.031
That's not what I was saying.
-It is.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.699
I helped you.
-Thanks for the help.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.999
Honey,
your brother was only trying to help.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.586
He's three years younger than me, Mom.
He shouldn't be helping me.

16:43.212 --> 16:46.131
I understand--
-And he's smarter than me, I get it.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.343
We take piano lessons.

16:49.343 --> 16:53.555
I can barely get through a bar of music,
he ends up playing Carnegie Hall.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.849
Once. It was a student recital.

16:59.394 --> 17:04.148
I lay there every night and listen to him
practice his stupid piano.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.694
He never makes a mistake.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.281
Not one slipup, ever.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.407
Jordan.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.329
When we get to Los Angeles,
I don't wanna be homeschooled anymore.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.249
Honey, you--
-I'm enrolling in public school.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.460
Why are we even homeschooled, anyways?

17:23.961 --> 17:25.503
You guys are so overprotective.

17:25.503 --> 17:28.924
It worked better for our family.
-You mean, for Eddie.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.009
Your brother needs more support.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.388
He got bullied in second grade.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.933
That was five years ago.
He can handle himself now.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.855
I need my own life, Mom.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.650
Thank you.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.235
Coming through.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.029
Is that a giant potato?
-Yeah.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.489
I just finished the ghost level.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.908
You didn't. There's no way.
-Yeah, I did.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.494
That was like a tutorial level.
That doesn't count anyways.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.121
Here you are, sir.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.622
Thank you.
-Okay.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.999
Ain't nothing but trouble.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.043
I already got enough problems.
-You looked like you was having fun.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.212
I had a good time.
-Put your tray down.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.505
What would you like, sir?

18:10.591 --> 18:12.634
Can I get a Jack and Coke, please.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.803
Tray table, please. Here you go.

18:15.888 --> 18:16.889
Can I get you anything else?

18:17.931 --> 18:20.517
Mommy, look.
-Oh, my God!

18:20.517 --> 18:23.687
Right, I'm like--
-You are definitely getting that.

18:23.687 --> 18:27.274
No, it's like a gajillion dollars.
Where am I ever gonna wear it?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.067
On dates.
-No, Mom, I don't date.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.486
Nobody dates. Don't say dates.
-All right, then when you hook up.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.988
I don't know.
-No, Mom.

18:32.988 --> 18:35.407
All I know is your father
is getting you that for your birthday.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.784
This is insane. Yeah.
-I-- Isn't this crazy?

18:37.784 --> 18:40.579
Look, all of this is vintage.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.206
You know, this if from the 70s.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.541
So beautiful.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.337
Mom, I've been wondering.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.089
Is everything--
-Yeah?

18:51.089 --> 18:54.718
Like, has everything been okay?

18:55.886 --> 18:56.887
What do you mean?

18:56.887 --> 18:58.931
Like, between you and Dad?

18:59.932 --> 19:00.933
Course.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.351
Like, your relationship.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.021
Honey, we have a wonderful relationship.
You know that.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.317
Okay, it just seems like
he's been away a lot lately.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.237
Well, that is true.
He's been away on business.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.740
You know, I mean, he is an excellent
provider for our family.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.659
So--
-Yeah, I'm not saying he's not. I'm just--

19:18.659 --> 19:20.619
Well, he's always worked very hard.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.371
I know.
I'm just a little worried about you.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.708
Why?

19:27.251 --> 19:28.669
Honey, I'm fine.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.754
This was always the plan. Work hard.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.842
And then the plan is when he retires,
we get to do all the fun things.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.552
We get to go on the Alaska cruise...
-Right.

19:36.552 --> 19:40.097
...we get to go on the bike ride across
Scandinavia, the river tour in Eur--

19:40.097 --> 19:42.182
All the things.
-Yeah?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.893
Don't worry about me.
You know what you should worry about?

19:46.436 --> 19:47.437
I need shoes.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.523
Well,
I don't really have time for shoes, Mom.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.733
What do you mean?
Mani-pedis aren't till 3:00.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.361
Hey, Dee Dee, I think this would also
look incredible on you.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.530
What do you think? Fantastic, right?
-Oh, my God.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.198
Look at this. I'm trying this on.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.950
I'm trying this on, then we'll get shoes.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.202
Luis, can you get me shoes?
-Will do.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.829
You look amazing, by the way.
-Thank you.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.122
You need to get that.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.083
I'm coming with the shoes, Dee Dee.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.799
Wait.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.719
Why are you looking at me like that?
I have something to ask you.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.889
Sorry, I have an audition.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.350
Good luck.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.520
Most people don't drink gin
because they say gin makes you sin.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.316
I've never found that to be true though.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.611
I'll be ready in 15 minutes.
-Thanks, Cora.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.072
Yep. Okay. Got it.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.700
Need to get this approved, ASAP.
-Yep, on it.

20:42.201 --> 20:44.536
Sorry, do you mind
if I place you on a brief hold?

20:44.536 --> 20:46.205
Congresswoman Washington's office.

20:46.914 --> 20:47.998
No, this is Adriana.

20:48.832 --> 20:49.833
Yep, I'm her aide.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.085
Okay, noted.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.588
Congresswoman Washington's office.

20:54.588 --> 20:58.342
Sir, I'm gonna need you to stop
using that kind of--

20:58.342 --> 20:59.593
Congresswoman Washington's office.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.553
No, the Congresswoman
cares about all constituents--

21:01.553 --> 21:03.055
Congresswoman Washington's office.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.015
I understand you are frustrated.
Thank you for your call.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.808
I'm so sorry.
We will look into that immediately.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.227
Congresswoman Washington's office.

21:08.227 --> 21:11.021
Yes, we are well aware of that
and we'll take care of it.

21:11.522 --> 21:13.315
Angela, hi.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.528
Hi, I'm Adriana from
Congresswoman Washington's office.

21:17.528 --> 21:20.072
It's nice to finally
meet you in person. Sorry I'm late.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.951
Well, at least you showed up.

21:24.785 --> 21:25.911
Come on.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.081
There's no heat, no gas.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.167
Landlord's trying to get everybody out.

21:33.252 --> 21:35.462
I wish I could take him in, but I can't.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.632
I got two kids I'm raising on my own,
and I work full-time.

21:38.632 --> 21:39.716
Yeah.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.094
My brother has a mental illness.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.972
He needs support. He needs housing.

21:44.972 --> 21:47.808
He's been on that waiting list
for over a year. I just--

21:48.892 --> 21:51.144
Someone needs to help.
-Yeah.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.021
He's not gonna make it much longer.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.360
Byron, it's your sister.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.071
I'm coming in.

22:12.624 --> 22:13.625
Hi, Byron.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.005
Byron, can you hear me?

22:18.672 --> 22:20.340
Byron, take the damn headphones out,

22:20.340 --> 22:21.800
you see the lady standing here.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.144
Byron, my name is Adriana,

22:32.144 --> 22:35.981
and I work
for Congresswoman Washington's office.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.697
We're gonna get you help, okay?

22:43.697 --> 22:46.533
We're gonna get you a place to live
with social services.

22:49.203 --> 22:50.329
Does that sound good?

22:53.999 --> 22:57.336
Byron, can you look at me,
so I know you can hear me?

23:07.054 --> 23:10.265
Okay. It's gonna be okay.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.287
Hey, I'm on my way out.
-Cool. Have a good shift.

23:33.997 --> 23:34.998
Okay.

23:37.376 --> 23:39.670
Listen, your sister might call later.

23:39.670 --> 23:40.754
So--
-What?

23:41.255 --> 23:44.716
After the flight, she wants to catch up.
She's worried, so...

23:45.509 --> 23:46.552
What did you say?

23:46.552 --> 23:49.388
Nothing. Maybe she should
give you a call when she lands.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.140
Why?
-Because she's your sister.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.727
Who I have an intensely
complicated relationship with,

23:55.727 --> 23:57.604
which you know.
-I just--

23:57.604 --> 24:00.941
Yeah. I just think maybe it could be
really good to talk to her.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.109
To talk to people.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.027
I already talked to her. It didn't help.

24:04.027 --> 24:08.574
And I don't love that you two
are conspiring against me.

24:08.574 --> 24:10.534
It's not a conspiracy.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.202
I just think that maybe, like,

24:13.704 --> 24:16.248
this is too much for you to be
holding inside of yourself like this.

24:16.248 --> 24:19.668
So you pass me off to my sister
while you go to your man cave?

24:19.668 --> 24:22.546
While I go to my job--
-So you don't have to deal with it.

24:23.839 --> 24:24.840
Listen...

24:27.467 --> 24:28.969
she didn't call me. I called her.

24:30.721 --> 24:32.514
I called her
'cause I'm really worried about you,

24:32.514 --> 24:36.268
'cause I don't know
how to help you right now,

24:36.268 --> 24:39.062
which is, like, really terrifying for me,
so I called--

24:39.062 --> 24:40.147
Worried about what?

24:42.608 --> 24:44.193
Doctor Berkowitz said maybe it's time

24:44.193 --> 24:45.819
to consider adoption.
-Berkowitz is an asshole.

24:45.819 --> 24:49.323
Yeah, he's our fertility doctor,
and he's concerned about the number--

24:49.323 --> 24:50.407
about the amount--

24:51.450 --> 24:52.451
about the number of--

24:55.954 --> 24:57.331
The miscarriages?

24:59.708 --> 25:00.876
You can say the word.

25:00.876 --> 25:02.961
What if we just met
with the adoption agency?

25:02.961 --> 25:06.632
Or, like, we just go explore our options,
you know?

25:06.632 --> 25:08.425
And I'm not saying give up.
I just mean, like,

25:08.425 --> 25:11.637
simultaneously explore our options.
-That's not our plan, John.

25:11.637 --> 25:13.305
We've designed this room three times...

25:13.305 --> 25:15.057
That has never--
-...for three different children.

25:15.057 --> 25:17.392
We've got three layers of paint
on the wall.

25:17.976 --> 25:21.063
And I'm fucking scared because
I don't know what this is doing to you

25:21.063 --> 25:23.899
or to your body, to your soul, to us.

25:27.778 --> 25:30.697
I think we can love a kid,
doesn't matter whose DNA it has.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.331
It's good to know how you feel.
-Oh, come on.

25:39.331 --> 25:42.334
Go to work, John.
-Come on. Talk to me.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.418
Go to work, John.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.540
Mommy got a big audition.

26:21.540 --> 26:22.666
Yay!

26:22.666 --> 26:26.461
Yeah, really exciting.
It's for a really big movie.

26:27.629 --> 26:31.133
The only thing is, it's in Los Angeles.

26:31.133 --> 26:34.428
You're going to Los Angeles again?
Can I come?

26:34.428 --> 26:38.515
Not this time.
But you get to stay with Leeza and Odie.

26:39.349 --> 26:40.517
How long?

26:40.517 --> 26:41.727
One night.

26:41.727 --> 26:46.481
Just one sleep apart, and I'll be right
here with you before you know it. Okay?

26:48.483 --> 26:51.195
Pinky swear?
-Pinky swear.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.530
Don't worry. Let's go.

26:53.530 --> 26:55.449
Ladies and gentleman,
from the flight deck,

26:55.449 --> 26:56.783
this is Captain again.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.119
I'm gonna go ahead
and turn on the seat belt sign,

26:59.119 --> 27:02.164
as you can feel
there's some turbulence in the area.

27:02.164 --> 27:04.333
We're also looking at some rain showers
up ahead.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.960
We're gonna work with air traffic control.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.297
Disappointed that he still
hasn't opened an investigation.

27:10.297 --> 27:11.924
I will tell him.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.801
And don't let him
talk circles around you either.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.178
You know me better than that.

27:19.014 --> 27:21.517
It's not a good time.
-It's urgent. Please.

27:22.768 --> 27:23.852
One minute.
-Okay.

27:25.312 --> 27:26.688
Byron Williams.

27:26.688 --> 27:30.567
He's a mentally-disabled suicide risk
living in unsafe conditions.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.654
I found a good situation for him, okay?

27:33.654 --> 27:37.157
Subsidized housing with support services,
but it's taking too long.

27:38.242 --> 27:40.327
If you were to just make one call...

27:40.327 --> 27:42.996
You know the protocol in this office.
-I know.

27:43.497 --> 27:45.749
And I would never dream of
taking advantage of our relationship.

27:46.416 --> 27:48.043
Well, what are you doing right now?

27:50.379 --> 27:52.297
I know that your time
is incredibly precious,

27:52.297 --> 27:54.633
and the work you do every day,
it's essential.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.052
I appreciate the suck up.

27:58.011 --> 28:02.558
Your job is extremely difficult,
but you are doing everything right.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.977
Then why don't I feel like
I'm doing anything right?

28:06.603 --> 28:09.064
Sorry.
It's just, I make endless calls every day,

28:09.064 --> 28:11.483
and I feel like
I'm getting nothing accomplished.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.778
He's not gonna make it much longer.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.155
One call.

28:18.407 --> 28:19.741
Please.

28:21.410 --> 28:22.411
Give me the number.

28:23.996 --> 28:25.038
Okay.

28:28.667 --> 28:29.668
Thank you.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.380
And get us a table at the Rooster tonight.

28:33.881 --> 28:35.424
You need a drink, girl.

28:39.261 --> 28:43.056
I know what you're gonna say.
I should just toughen up. Deal with it.

28:43.056 --> 28:47.811
I hate to break it to you, but you're
a public servant if I ever saw one.

28:47.811 --> 28:48.896
My sympathies.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.772
Hi, Congresswoman.
-Hi. How you doing?

28:52.941 --> 28:54.568
Grandma.
-Don't call me that.

28:54.568 --> 28:59.156
We're not in the office.
-This is still work. We need clear lines.

29:02.201 --> 29:03.452
Madame Congresswoman.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.037
Much better.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.748
You're a goddamn icon.

29:09.583 --> 29:12.461
I see people and when they look at you,
they think...

29:13.670 --> 29:18.425
"That's who I wanna be.
That's who I want my daughter to be."

29:20.427 --> 29:22.304
I will never do what you've done.

29:23.055 --> 29:24.056
Okay.

29:24.056 --> 29:27.601
I may have helped pave the way
for women of color,

29:28.560 --> 29:31.605
but without powerful young women like you
to take it further,

29:31.605 --> 29:32.898
we've accomplished nothing.

29:32.898 --> 29:33.982
I know.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.777
That's why I want you to run for my seat.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.154
What?

29:40.322 --> 29:42.824
When I'm done, that is. I'm not dead yet.

29:45.536 --> 29:48.413
I-- N-- I can't.

29:50.207 --> 29:51.834
You think I'm someone I'm not.

29:52.501 --> 29:56.797
I see exactly who you are.
You just haven't figured it out yet.

29:58.757 --> 30:01.301
I figured one more term for me.

30:02.219 --> 30:04.555
Then 2026.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.807
Has a nice ring to it. Doesn't it?

30:10.227 --> 30:11.728
I don't know what to say.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.398
Now I'll be your Grandma.

30:15.482 --> 30:19.653
When your boss offers you her job,
take it, dumbass.

30:24.074 --> 30:26.159
Ladies and gentlemen, as the captain said,

30:26.159 --> 30:27.536
we are experiencing turbulence.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.455
Please fasten your seat belts
and take your seats immediately.

30:37.129 --> 30:38.839
Yes, this is great news.

30:38.839 --> 30:43.594
Yes, he definitely wants the placement.
I will tell them right now.

30:45.137 --> 30:47.264
Yeah, I will call you
first thing in the morning.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.433
Okay. Bye.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.107
Hi, it's Adriana
with Congresswoman Washington's office.

30:57.107 --> 31:00.027
I have some really good news
about your brother's placement. I would--

31:01.570 --> 31:02.571
What?

31:05.365 --> 31:06.366
Well, how did--

31:08.327 --> 31:09.453
When did this happen?

31:09.953 --> 31:11.747
I've just been thinking about it
a little bit...

31:11.747 --> 31:14.291
Uh-huh.
-...and I'm giving my notice.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.667
What?
-Angela...

31:15.667 --> 31:17.753
Come on.
-...I'm so sorry.

31:20.464 --> 31:21.548
I'm so, so sorry.

31:23.926 --> 31:25.552
All right, you're good. Come on.

31:25.552 --> 31:26.887
Shoes off.

31:26.887 --> 31:27.971
Laptops out.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.348
I don't wanna leave you.

31:29.348 --> 31:30.432
I know.

31:30.432 --> 31:33.560
You did everything you could
for that young man.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.978
I'm leaving, Grandma.

31:35.562 --> 31:36.772
I'm leaving your office.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.024
And I'm leaving politics.

31:41.109 --> 31:43.403
And my last official act
as your constituent aide

31:43.403 --> 31:46.365
will be attending Byron Williams's funeral
this afternoon.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.868
He took his own life, Grandma.

31:51.036 --> 31:52.287
I can't do it anymore.

31:54.498 --> 31:57.668
Honey, I love you.

32:00.212 --> 32:01.922
And I accept your resignation.

32:03.590 --> 32:08.136
But baby, you have to stop
telling yourself you can't.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.684
I'll see you soon.
-See ya.

32:16.603 --> 32:17.729
Excuse me.

32:17.729 --> 32:18.939
Sorry.
-That's okay.

33:05.652 --> 33:08.030
I'm looking at
a pretty big storm up ahead.

33:08.030 --> 33:10.949
Extends for about 40 miles.

33:10.949 --> 33:14.703
We're gonna have to deviate
right off course, about 30 degrees.

33:15.871 --> 33:16.872
Roger.

33:16.872 --> 33:21.752
Understand approved 30 degree deviations,
Trinity 1483.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.087
Eddie, I need to talk to you.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.340
Please return to your seats...
-Eddie.

33:26.840 --> 33:27.841
What?

33:27.841 --> 33:30.052
I've also called the flight attendants
and asked them...

33:30.052 --> 33:33.138
Listen, don't freak out, all right?

33:34.097 --> 33:35.224
What?

33:39.561 --> 33:43.690
When we get to LA,
I decided I'm going to public school.

33:46.026 --> 33:47.277
What?

33:47.277 --> 33:48.487
I don't know. I just...

33:49.738 --> 33:52.366
You know, we're moving,
and I wanted to make a change.

33:52.366 --> 33:54.076
You know, it's normal, Eddie.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.036
People go to school. It's normal.

33:56.537 --> 34:00.541
Jordan, public schools suck.
You've told me that a million times.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.126
We're getting a much better education.

34:03.126 --> 34:05.754
But we can't be together every single day

34:05.754 --> 34:07.506
for the rest of our lives, Eddie.

34:08.632 --> 34:10.634
So it's about girls?
-What? No.

34:10.634 --> 34:12.761
Real smart being led around by your dick.
-Come on, Ed--

34:12.761 --> 34:14.972
Nice timing, Jordan.
You're telling me now?

34:16.849 --> 34:19.685
I've been trying to tell you.
It's-- Eddie, come on.

34:19.685 --> 34:21.562
Eddie, stop. Calm down.
-Can I get past you?

34:21.562 --> 34:23.563
No. Eddie, you're my brother.
-Hey.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.232
We're always gonna be-- Eddie!
-Move!

34:25.232 --> 34:28.402
What's going on? Eddie!
-Ladies and gentlemen,

34:28.402 --> 34:31.112
this is Captain speaking, as you can tell...

34:31.112 --> 34:32.406
Mom!

34:33.072 --> 34:34.283
What's going on, sweetie?

34:34.283 --> 34:36.368
Jordan said
he's going to public high school.

34:36.368 --> 34:37.452
Hey, honey.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.161
So you knew?

34:39.955 --> 34:42.498
You're my mom, and you knew about this,
and you didn't tell me.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.793
Honey.
-So you're letting him do it?

34:44.793 --> 34:46.210
Public schools suck.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.214
Isn't that what Dad always told us?
-I know that this is a lot.

34:49.214 --> 34:52.259
I'm sorry, he can't be up here right now.
-We just need one minute.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.760
The pilot's made an announcement,

34:53.760 --> 34:55.344
and the seat belt sign is on.
-Mom.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.389
Okay, it's my son. Please.

34:58.056 --> 34:59.516
All right, one minute.

34:59.516 --> 35:02.477
Mom.
-I know this is a lot of change at once.

35:02.477 --> 35:06.857
Everything was good the way it was.
Why does it all have to change?

35:06.857 --> 35:09.234
Your brother just needs some independence.

35:09.234 --> 35:12.529
It's a natural thing.
I know it doesn't make sense right now,

35:12.529 --> 35:16.617
but in a couple of years,
you're gonna want that independence too.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.620
And I know it hurts.

35:20.120 --> 35:26.835
I know how hard it hurts,
but you guys will always have each other.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.378
I promise you, okay?

35:31.173 --> 35:33.800
We're moving to LA for your job.
-Flight attendants, this is the captain.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.345
Jordan is going to public school.
-Please take your jump seats.

35:36.345 --> 35:38.931
I never wanted to move.
I never wanted things to be different.

35:38.931 --> 35:41.600
Sweetie, I understand, okay? I do.
-No, you don't.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.310
No, you don't. You should've told me

35:43.310 --> 35:45.604
before I got on this plane.
-You need to get back to your seat.

35:45.604 --> 35:46.605
I hate change!

35:46.605 --> 35:48.440
I hate your stupid TV writing...
-Now!

35:48.440 --> 35:50.776
...and I hate you!
-Please, don't say that!

35:50.776 --> 35:54.696
Fasten your seat belt.
-Eddie, I love you!

35:54.696 --> 35:56.573
Everyone needs to put their laptops away.

35:56.573 --> 35:58.784
Tables up. We're experiencing turbulence.

35:58.784 --> 36:00.786
I need to take all service items now.

36:00.786 --> 36:03.747
Tray tables up. Tray tables up.
Collect all service items.

36:03.747 --> 36:04.957
Thank you so much.

36:04.957 --> 36:06.834
Everything's okay.
-Is everything okay?

36:06.834 --> 36:09.169
It's fine. Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.

36:14.925 --> 36:18.178
Flight attendants will now demonstrate
the brace position.

36:18.887 --> 36:22.015
Lean forward as far as you can
and grab your arms tightly.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.441
It's your father.
I wonder if he got our silly pictures.

36:37.239 --> 36:40.826
"Lonely pilgrim"?
What is he talking about?

36:42.077 --> 36:44.788
Well, he loves us.

36:45.789 --> 36:47.833
Yeah, or he had one too many cocktails.

36:49.251 --> 36:51.795
Probably. Probably that too.

36:56.091 --> 36:58.051
I need you to run
the dual engine checklist.

36:58.051 --> 37:01.847
We have a red emergency.
We've had a dual engine failure.

37:01.847 --> 37:03.807
We're gonna try a restart.

37:03.807 --> 37:07.519
At this point, I need you to prepare
the cabin for a potential ditching.

37:36.882 --> 37:39.009
I need to go be with my family.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.470
We'll be okay.

37:41.470 --> 37:42.930
Yeah. Yes, we will.

37:42.930 --> 37:45.015
Hey! You all right?

37:45.015 --> 37:47.518
We're okay.
-Okay.

37:48.143 --> 37:49.478
Ma'am!
-Everyone's okay.

37:49.478 --> 37:50.896
Back to your seat.
-This is my wife.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.064
This is my family.

37:52.064 --> 37:54.191
I need to stay with my family, please.
-Ma'am.

37:54.191 --> 37:57.611
I'm so sorry, the captain has made it
very clear everyone must remain seated.

37:57.611 --> 37:58.946
These are my kids.

37:58.946 --> 38:00.989
I need to stay with my kids.
-She's their mother!

38:00.989 --> 38:04.076
Ma'am, please don't make me repeat myself.
Get back to your seat!

38:04.076 --> 38:04.993
It's okay.

38:04.993 --> 38:07.079
Now! Now, ma'am!
-Jane. It's okay.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.540
You're gonna be okay, you guys.
-Jane!

38:09.540 --> 38:11.041
It's okay.
-Yeah. Okay.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.918
We'll see you when we land.
-We're gonna be fine.

38:12.918 --> 38:14.920
Okay, bye.
-Love you, Mom.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.046
Mom!
-See you.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.130
It's okay.

38:18.841 --> 38:20.050
Mom!

38:22.678 --> 38:25.848
It's okay, Eddie. It's gonna be fine.
It's just some bad turbulence.

38:25.848 --> 38:27.307
This is Captain speaking.

38:27.307 --> 38:30.394
We are going to make an emergency landing

38:30.394 --> 38:32.855
short of our destination
at Denver International...

38:34.231 --> 38:35.232
Thank you.

38:35.232 --> 38:36.650
Hey, hold my hand.

38:37.317 --> 38:38.610
I gotcha.

38:39.528 --> 38:40.529
Eddie, you all right?

38:41.196 --> 38:42.197
It's all right.

38:42.197 --> 38:44.700
Hey, Eddie. It's okay. Look at me.

38:45.242 --> 38:48.370
I checked, there's a bus
that goes to the beach in Santa Monica.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.956
Tomorrow we can go
swimming in the ocean together. Okay?

38:50.956 --> 38:52.207
Okay, just me and you.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.418
Okay.
-It's gonna be okay.

38:54.418 --> 38:56.753
I'm really scared, Jordan.
I'm really goddamn scared.

38:56.753 --> 38:58.797
I know. Just think about the beach. Okay?

38:59.506 --> 39:00.883
...forgive us our trespasses,

39:00.883 --> 39:02.467
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

39:03.260 --> 39:06.513
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

39:07.014 --> 39:08.557
...the kingdom and power and the glory--

39:16.398 --> 39:17.399
Hey.

39:27.951 --> 39:28.952
Fuck!

39:30.829 --> 39:32.206
It's coming.
-Oh, my God!

39:41.673 --> 39:45.385
Brace! Stop! Stay down!

39:52.643 --> 39:53.936
Eddie!

39:54.937 --> 39:57.731
Eddie! Jordan!
-Brace!

39:57.731 --> 39:59.024
Heads down!

39:59.024 --> 40:01.693
Okay, let's go. We gotta brace now.
Listen to me, put your head down

40:01.693 --> 40:03.654
in between your legs right now...
-Dad, I'm scared.

40:03.654 --> 40:04.988
...right now, head down.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.324
Come on.
-God help us.

40:08.075 --> 40:10.494
I'm here with you.
-Stay down, everybody!

40:11.370 --> 40:12.829
Head down.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.039
I love you, dad.

40:14.957 --> 40:16.291
Stay down!

40:17.793 --> 40:19.419
I love you, guys. I love you.

40:20.629 --> 40:24.550
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I fear no evil,

40:24.550 --> 40:27.594
for thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me...

40:27.594 --> 40:30.681
You're okay, Eddie. You're okay.
-I love you, Dad.

40:37.896 --> 40:39.147
Stay down!

40:44.069 --> 40:45.571
I love you, guys.

40:45.571 --> 40:46.947
Love you, Dad.

41:21.648 --> 41:22.649
Hello?

41:24.276 --> 41:25.277
Yeah.

41:27.779 --> 41:28.780
Yeah, I'll be ready.

41:49.301 --> 41:50.719
It's just not a look.

41:51.220 --> 41:53.931
Okay. Well, I understand.
-You know it. You of all people.

41:53.931 --> 41:57.017
I don't wanna say goodbye.
-I know. But I gotta go.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.936
You do?
-I do. Yeah.

41:58.936 --> 42:00.145
I love you.

42:00.646 --> 42:01.772
Okay.

42:01.772 --> 42:05.317
Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday. Bye.

42:05.901 --> 42:07.653
I love you.
-I love you.

45:42.701 --> 45:43.702
Here.

45:49.833 --> 45:50.834
Here.

45:53.545 --> 45:54.546
Oh, my God.

46:07.226 --> 46:08.268
I'm here.

46:10.020 --> 46:11.021
I'm here.

46:13.148 --> 46:14.149
Okay.

46:15.192 --> 46:18.403
Okay. I gotcha. Come here.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.490
You're gonna be okay.

46:24.660 --> 46:25.661
I'm right here.

46:31.583 --> 46:32.584
I'm here.
