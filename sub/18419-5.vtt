WEBVTT

02:34.788 --> 02:36.224
Michiko.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.088
Michiko.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.757
Michiko!

05:44.945 --> 05:46.680
Salisbury steaks
in brown gravy.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.418
A new frozen main dish.
A taste of home.

05:50.418 --> 05:54.021
Your own shooting gallery?
You bet, with the...

05:56.424 --> 05:57.925
The United States continues

05:57.925 --> 06:00.127
to reinforce its Cuban base
at Guantanamo Bay,

06:00.127 --> 06:03.797
the naval depot that Castro
wants the U.S. to give up.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.433
These marines have
been assigned the job

06:05.433 --> 06:07.267
of protecting the base
against any Cuban threats

06:07.267 --> 06:09.803
that might arise during
the present crisis.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.305
They'll be on 24-hour alert--

06:12.305 --> 06:15.175
our first line of defense.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.495
I hear you've been
looking for me.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.029
I'm George Dixon.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.231
I disconnected the
microphones in your room

07:11.231 --> 07:13.701
and the tap on the phone
so we can talk.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.536
But they can still see you.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.838
Who is able to see me?

07:17.838 --> 07:20.541
You really should not
have come here.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.009
Listen, I came here
to find you.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.544
My mom told me be the truth
about you and Trudy.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.547
You betrayed everything
she died for.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.048
You're Resistance.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.851
Those men who just
tried to kill me,

07:30.851 --> 07:32.352
- are they with you?
- Since Trudy loved you,

07:32.352 --> 07:34.788
I'm going to give you
this advice just once.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.692
Run away, far away.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.128
We will never forget
what you did.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.963
- Don't hang up.
- Goodbye, Juliana.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.198
The Man in the High
Castle sent me.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.937
Hello?

07:51.539 --> 07:52.806
Hello.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.646
Tomorrow 8 a.m.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.981
Walk west into Central Park,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.716
past the Chancellor's
Museum

08:02.716 --> 08:05.352
towards the lake
at East 79th Street.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.021
- You got it?
- Yes.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.657
How will I find you?

08:09.657 --> 08:11.191
I'll find you.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.274
Sit beside me.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.924
Why here?

08:43.924 --> 08:47.294
I don't want to end up
in a Gestapo basement.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.233
I'm not a Nazi.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.203
Did you or did you not

08:56.203 --> 08:59.740
give Joe Blake the film
and let him escape?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.009
Not for the reasons
you think.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.445
So it's coincidence
you're sponsored

09:05.445 --> 09:08.348
by the most evil
son of a bitch
in the American Reich.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.750
What are you talking
about?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.652
John Smith.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.421
Do you know how many people

09:14.421 --> 09:16.056
he's had killed?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.826
No, I just met him.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.928
I don't know what he
wants from me, either.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.963
Well, he didn't
grant you asylum

09:22.963 --> 09:25.132
out of the kindness
of his own heart.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.368
I'm guessing
it has something to do

09:28.368 --> 09:30.904
with the Man
you mentioned.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.448
You're in his films,
George.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.250
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.186
In one of them,
San Francisco's destroyed

09:46.186 --> 09:48.121
by an atomic blast.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.190
Jesus.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.325
It's part of why I
came to find you.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.328
He thinks you've
got something to do
with causing it.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.497
Me? How?

09:57.497 --> 09:58.899
I don't know.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.201
- Why?
- I don't know.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.906
San Francisco is my home.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.209
I hate the Pons, but I want
to go back there one day.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.011
There are people there
that I love.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.880
So you can't think
of any reason why--

10:12.880 --> 10:14.715
No. Of course not.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.984
If I thought for a second
that he was right,

10:16.984 --> 10:21.154
I'd-- I'd put a bullet
in my own head.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.126
Then maybe this is enough:

10:26.126 --> 10:27.394
me warning you.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.162
Maybe this is enough
to stop it happening.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.631
If he wanted to talk to me,
he knows where I am.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.933
Why would he send you?

10:32.933 --> 10:36.336
He didn't exactly send me.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.742
Look,
he knew that I knew you

10:41.742 --> 10:43.711
from his films somehow,
but--

10:45.312 --> 10:47.748
Listen, my mom told me
the truth about you and Trudy,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.016
but I just had this feeling,

10:49.016 --> 10:50.350
and I knew it had to be
me who found you,

10:50.350 --> 10:54.287
that...this is all
happening for a reason.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.026
That's
really why you came here?

10:59.026 --> 11:01.328
You have to believe me.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.002
George.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.171
George?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.077
It's okay.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.289
Don't make me regret this.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.792
Let's go.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.961
- Where?
- You'll find out.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.509
Hello.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.044
- Annie?
- Yes.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.981
It-- Yeah, it's Thomas.

11:53.981 --> 11:57.484
I tried to find you
after school yesterday.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.387
I heard you're going
to the mixer with Barker?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.791
He asked me yesterday
after school.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.628
Yeah. That's okay.
I understand.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.598
He's, uh,
really athletic and all.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.033
Tommy's in love.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.203
Tommy and Annie,
sitting in a tree.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.571
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.840
That's enough.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.174
Thomas,
are you there?

12:21.174 --> 12:22.976
- Gotta go. Bye.
- Thomas?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.013
I'm sorry, Mother.

12:26.013 --> 12:29.282
Don't be sorry.
Just have a seat, please.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.554
Tommy's in love.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.488
Shut up.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.191
Did I just hear "Shut up"?

12:39.359 --> 12:42.229
Sorry, Father.
Jennifer was teasing me.

12:42.229 --> 12:46.299
No teasing at the table,
please, or anywhere else.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.905
Thomas,
is that a little peach fuzz

12:51.905 --> 12:53.306
I see on that chin of yours?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.443
I have an extra razor
you could use

12:56.443 --> 12:57.510
before we get you your own.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.246
Thank you, Father.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.651
Why don't I cancel
Julia tonight?

13:04.651 --> 13:07.687
Just the family for dinner.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.156
Such short notice.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.158
We don't want
to be rude, do we?

13:12.325 --> 13:14.561
I'm sure she's tired
from the move.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.163
Ah, she'll be fine.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.867
Everything will be fine.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.881
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.516
Everything go all right?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.252
Yeah. It went fine.
Where's Childan?

13:39.252 --> 13:42.422
Childan's here,
left alone,

13:42.422 --> 13:45.893
unpleasantly,
with the Conspiracy King.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.895
You'd be smart to take
that Heydrich tip.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.262
Depending
on how that plays out,

13:49.262 --> 13:50.697
it could shift
the power balance.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.033
Yes, well, it's already
shifted my blood pressure

13:53.033 --> 13:55.502
- sharply upward.
- You two work it out.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.703
I'm gonna take a shower,

13:56.703 --> 13:58.171
- clean up.
- Hey.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.674
We need to talk.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.910
What?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.945
Where have you been?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.517
Stashing the explosive.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.219
All night?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.825
You have got to be kidding me.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.227
You and that--

14:24.597 --> 14:25.832
So what about the stuff?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.167
What are they gonna do
with it?

14:27.167 --> 14:29.970
I didn't ask.
The less we know, the better.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.204
We shouldn't have done
that, Frank.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.405
We should not
have helped them.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.941
Come on. Tell me
it didn't feel good.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.742
It didn't.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.311
We're not like those
people, Frank.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.982
Yeah, well,
maybe we should be.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.519
Hey.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.591
A little privacy, please?

15:00.633 --> 15:01.634
Danke.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.406
Josef?

15:08.841 --> 15:11.244
I was informed
you were leaving.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.380
Have you come
to see me off or stop me?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.082
I will not force you
to stay,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.550
but there is something
I need to ask from you.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.718
What's that?

15:18.718 --> 15:20.187
I need you to come with me.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.854
There's something
I need to show you.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.056
My plane leaves at 3.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.058
I won't let it
leave without you.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.995
We'll drop you
at the airport after.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.462
After what?

15:29.462 --> 15:32.332
After you hear
the truth.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.535
Please. This is important,

15:35.535 --> 15:39.106
even more important
for you than me.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.758
What is this place?

15:58.758 --> 16:02.562
The Jews built it
as a nursing home
before the war.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.165
A poor investment.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.135
We renamed it
Haus Fruhlingsdammerung:

16:08.135 --> 16:10.503
Spring Dawn House.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.556
We won't be long.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.191
Come this way.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.064
Have you heard
of the term Lebensborn?

16:37.064 --> 16:42.802
No? I think the translation
is, uh, "Fountain of Life."

16:42.802 --> 16:44.437
Yeah, guys in school
used to talk

16:44.437 --> 16:46.339
about those
Fountain of Life places.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.376
Weren't they cat houses for
the top guys in the Reich?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.844
That was a myth
about them.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.614
What was,
and indeed remains real,

16:54.614 --> 16:58.751
is the Führer's desire
to perfect the species.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.955
And Lebensborn is...

17:02.955 --> 17:05.625
an early attempt
to that end.

17:05.625 --> 17:10.630
I think it-- This way.
This way. Ja.

17:12.199 --> 17:16.336
You see, this facility was
phased out in the late '40s

17:16.336 --> 17:20.740
after it failed to deliver
the desired results.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.275
But there are still some

17:22.275 --> 17:24.111
who still see the children
of Lebensborn

17:24.111 --> 17:25.645
as the chosen ones...

17:27.314 --> 17:29.416
the Führer's own offspring.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.852
I guess there's a point
to this, right?

17:32.852 --> 17:34.887
Yes.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.157
Racially desirable women

17:37.157 --> 17:39.326
volunteered
to have their babies

17:39.326 --> 17:41.828
at the Lebensborn
birthing houses

17:41.828 --> 17:45.132
to be raised in line
with the Party ideals.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.768
Places like this one

17:48.768 --> 17:54.807
were to provide
the next generation
of the SS elite.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.820
So this was
a birthing house.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.158
This was...

18:11.158 --> 18:13.793
your birthing house,
Josef.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.308
What the hell are you
talking about?

18:28.308 --> 18:32.945
You were born here
on April 10, 1935,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.448
at 7:32 in the morning.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.186
No, I wasn't.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.487
On August
the following year,

18:40.487 --> 18:42.289
you were kidnapped
and taken to America.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.425
No. I was born in Brooklyn
in a filthy hovel

18:45.425 --> 18:48.361
that
my mother couldn't afford
because you abandoned us.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.297
I'm sorry.
That simply isn't true.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.765
I understand how
upsetting this must be.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.734
You don't understand
a thing about me.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.303
When Elsa stole you,

18:56.303 --> 18:58.638
I wanted her caught
and you brought back.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.473
But I came to realize
this program was wrong.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.276
Its intentions were pure,
but its methods were cruel.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.644
I don't believe
a word you're saying!

19:04.644 --> 19:06.879
Your mother was right
to take you away, Josef.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.014
You must never blame her.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.582
Stay the hell away from me.

19:59.866 --> 20:00.933
Yes, Sergeant.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.302
Sir,

20:02.302 --> 20:04.504
our agents have located
Juliana Crain in New York

20:04.504 --> 20:06.038
and are making arrangements.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.409
Inform them I want her
brought back immediately.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.645
Sir, it may be more
complicated than we thought.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.258
Her asylum is being
personally sponsored

20:25.258 --> 20:26.926
by Obergruppenführer Smith.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.700
That is...

20:33.700 --> 20:35.868
very troubling.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.239
Do we proceed with
the operation anyway?

21:07.467 --> 21:12.339
The Nazis keep jamming
the usual frequency,

21:12.339 --> 21:16.008
but they broadcast
on a secondary...

21:28.220 --> 21:29.756
What kind of music is this?

21:29.756 --> 21:33.760
It's Pirate Radio,
from the Neutral Zone.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.564
A little reminder of
what we're fighting for.

21:37.564 --> 21:40.533
Unlike any music
I've ever heard.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.268
That's
because it's illegal.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.538
Too much of
the Negro influence.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.907
So don't tune in at home

21:47.907 --> 21:49.609
if you don't want
the Nazis listening.

21:55.948 --> 21:56.849
You wouldn't know it,

21:56.849 --> 21:58.685
but this
used to be a great city...

22:00.152 --> 22:01.654
before.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.393
It was noisy
and a little messy

22:06.393 --> 22:08.395
but...

22:08.395 --> 22:10.530
totally alive.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.466
San Francisco, too.

22:13.466 --> 22:16.569
You're too young
to remember, aren't you?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.771
I remember looking out
the window with Trudy,

22:18.771 --> 22:21.641
watching the Japanese tanks
rolling down the Embarcadero.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.846
How did she get here?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.948
Into the Reich.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.154
I don't want to talk
about Trudy.
Why not?

22:35.154 --> 22:37.890
Because she worshiped
the ground you walked on.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.426
After what you did,

22:39.426 --> 22:41.193
even she
couldn't forgive you.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.129
if you think you knew
my sister better than I did,

22:43.129 --> 22:44.096
you're wrong.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.233
Here's the deal, kiddo.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.602
Your father and I
were best friends.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.839
Your mother and I were...

22:52.839 --> 22:54.106
close.

22:54.106 --> 22:57.009
So I don't want your blood
on my hands.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.044
What does that mean?

22:58.044 --> 23:00.680
My people want you dead
for what you did.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.582
You sent them away.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.551
Well, I'm not in charge.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.553
The only reason they're
letting me talk to you

23:06.553 --> 23:07.820
is to give you a chance.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.756
- Chance to what?
- Redeem yourself.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.526
Look, George, I can't
get the film back.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.895
Oh, they know that.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.931
Then what do they
want from me?

23:26.573 --> 23:28.641
Tell me this isn't
about Smith.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.077
He's our top target.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.513
We've come
close, but...

23:33.513 --> 23:35.748
I'm not an assassin,
George.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.884
Nobody's asking you
to do that--

23:37.884 --> 23:40.186
Not right now,
at any rate.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.162
I don't know what you
think I can do.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.867
We want you to get close to
the Smiths and their friends.

23:54.867 --> 23:55.968
Why?

23:55.968 --> 23:58.404
Because my people
are telling you to.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.973
Look, you don't understand.
They're playing at something.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.509
They don't actually trust me.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.310
Go figure.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.013
Look, you tell your people
that this isn't going to work.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.515
You understand?

24:08.515 --> 24:10.583
You really want me
to do that?

24:10.583 --> 24:13.252
Because it's the deal
I struck with them

24:13.252 --> 24:15.722
to keep them
from killing you.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.096
I think I'm going
to be sick.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.535
You really shouldn't
have helped that Nazi.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.580
Did you ever love her?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.716
Or was she
just breeding stock?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.651
Oh, I loved your mother.

25:19.886 --> 25:24.190
And I was very proud
of my first son.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.760
Why didn't she tell me?

25:29.028 --> 25:31.831
If she had told you
the truth,

25:31.831 --> 25:34.233
how would you
have reacted? Hmm?

25:36.636 --> 25:38.337
My whole life is a lie.

25:38.337 --> 25:41.240
Hmm.
No, no, no, no, no.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.143
Your actions
define you.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.145
And they do not lie.

25:46.145 --> 25:50.049
I am proud of the man
that you have become.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.984
And who is that?

25:56.155 --> 25:57.489
Who have I become?

25:57.489 --> 26:01.027
You are a good man,

26:01.027 --> 26:05.097
worthy of my trust,
Josef.

26:07.066 --> 26:11.203
There is a world of
possibilities here for you,

26:11.203 --> 26:12.672
if you want them.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.008
I want very much
for you to stay,

26:16.008 --> 26:19.646
but if you prefer
to go to New York,

26:19.646 --> 26:21.748
I understand.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.183
And I will
no longer interfere.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.076
Oh, hey, what's going on?

26:52.879 --> 26:54.681
I got your message.

26:54.681 --> 26:57.049
Come in and find out.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.217
How's Ed?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.987
I kind of like Ed.

27:00.987 --> 27:04.590
Oh, yeah? Uh, well, yeah,
he likes you, too.

27:04.590 --> 27:08.460
Frank,
you did good yesterday.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.796
Want a beer?

27:09.796 --> 27:10.997
Nah, no thanks.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.433
So you know what you're
going to do with it?

27:14.433 --> 27:16.268
The explosive?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.705
Not your problem.

27:18.705 --> 27:22.508
But it won't go
to waste. Trust me.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.376
Yeah. I trust you.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.714
- You all right?
- Yeah.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.248
Can I talk to you
for a second?

27:29.248 --> 27:30.382
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.085
I really feel like, uh,

27:33.085 --> 27:35.187
like I should be there,
you know?

27:35.187 --> 27:37.423
We both know where you
need to be right now.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.625
You're the only one
standing between him and--

27:39.625 --> 27:41.293
Yeah. I know. I know.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.531
Leave this for me.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.565
Yeah.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.734
Okay.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.035
Look out for yourself,
brother.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.269
All right. You, too.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.637
Sara.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.405
Be safe.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.656
So what are we doing here?

28:10.656 --> 28:12.291
What does it look like,
Frank?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.027
Wetting my whistle.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.232
There's something I need
to ask you about.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.801
Shoot.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.571
The films.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.439
I need to know about them.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.210
Why?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.913
Because I saw the one
that Juliana--

28:36.648 --> 28:39.018
Because I saw myself
die in it.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.853
You were in the film?

28:40.853 --> 28:42.789
Yeah, I was in--

28:44.623 --> 28:48.995
I, uh, saw myself...
get executed.

28:50.529 --> 28:51.798
Then you know everything

28:51.798 --> 28:53.632
you need to know
about the films,

28:53.632 --> 28:55.902
why we don't fucking
watch them.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.806
I was on my knees.
It never happened.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.173
How could they have
a film--

29:01.173 --> 29:03.810
Ted Vecchione, 1947.
Bobby Vecchione, 1949.

29:03.810 --> 29:09.816
Sam Kyle--
Karen's husband, 1961.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.985
And now Karen herself--

29:14.053 --> 29:17.023
the last of the Vecchione
family, 1962.

29:18.557 --> 29:19.826
What are you talking
about?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.193
I'm talking about the fact

29:21.193 --> 29:23.095
that it doesn't matter
what you saw on those films.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.364
We're all going to die.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.367
The question is, do you
want to die on your knees

29:28.367 --> 29:30.837
or do you want to die
standing tall?

29:33.039 --> 29:35.041
We have to go.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.844
Come with us.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.498
He came alone?

29:59.498 --> 30:01.267
No appointment?

30:01.267 --> 30:02.401
Yes, sir.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.982
Chief Inspector Kido.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.488
I am
Obergruppenführer Smith.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.191
Obergruppenführer.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.461
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

30:29.461 --> 30:33.132
I come on the orders
of General Onoda

30:33.132 --> 30:35.034
with a request.

30:41.607 --> 30:45.945
For the extradition
of Juliana Crain.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.622
Please come in.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.961
Well, this is a...

31:01.961 --> 31:05.998
it's a little awkward,
I must say, Chief Inspector.

31:05.998 --> 31:09.401
You see, Juliana Crain

31:09.401 --> 31:13.172
has been granted
asylum here in the Reich.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.141
But when that decision
was made,

31:15.141 --> 31:19.345
the Reich may not have been in
possession of all the facts.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.412
No?

31:22.414 --> 31:23.482
Please take a seat.

31:31.357 --> 31:35.061
Miss Crain is a known
member of the Resistance.

31:35.061 --> 31:39.631
She was involved in the murder
of two of my officers.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.969
We interviewed Miss Crain.

31:42.969 --> 31:46.105
I'm satisfied she was never
a member of the Resistance.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.440
In fact,
she sought refuge here

31:48.440 --> 31:50.109
because the Resistance
is trying to kill her.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.344
Yes,
because she betrayed them

31:52.344 --> 31:56.548
after they brought her to meet
the Man in the High Castle.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.654
You have proof of this?

32:10.329 --> 32:13.099
Erich, could you, uh,

32:13.099 --> 32:14.366
could you give us a moment?

32:25.877 --> 32:29.181
The medal behind your desk.

32:29.181 --> 32:32.218
Might I examine it
more closely?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.025
Be my guest.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.137
The Solomon Islands.

32:53.772 --> 32:58.044
Why display a medal from
your U.S. military service?

33:00.046 --> 33:02.181
I keep it as a reminder.

33:04.216 --> 33:09.055
The consequences
of the failure of command.

33:16.828 --> 33:21.067
There were many casualties
in that campaign.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.172
On both sides.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.510
You were there?

33:31.510 --> 33:35.747
Yes, Obergruppenführer.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.253
I was.

33:56.602 --> 34:00.306
Tell me something,
Chief Inspector.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.410
Soldier to soldier.

34:09.115 --> 34:11.250
You must have known
before you came here

34:11.250 --> 34:13.119
I was going to refuse
your extradition request.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.191
Why are you really here?

34:49.221 --> 34:50.822
Sir, if I may ask--

34:50.822 --> 34:52.491
Listen to me, Erich.

34:54.393 --> 34:58.664
I want you to erase
all record of that meeting

34:58.664 --> 34:59.831
from the log.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.169
Understand?

35:05.171 --> 35:07.206
He was never here.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.875
Hello.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.344
Good day, Miss Mills.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.379
It's John Smith.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.547
Well, hello.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.114
Did I catch you
at a bad time?

36:23.114 --> 36:24.450
No, no, no.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.652
I've just been doing
a little house cleaning.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.920
Cleanliness is a virtue
here in the Reich.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.257
Yes. Yes, I read that.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.691
Glad you're fitting in.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.360
Helen wanted me to ask you

36:34.360 --> 36:36.528
if you have any
objection to pot roast.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.530
- Pot roast?
- For dinner tonight.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.466
That is if you
can still make it?

36:40.466 --> 36:44.002
Right. Uh, pot roast
is wonderful.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.604
Is there anything
I can bring?

36:45.604 --> 36:48.274
No, just yourself.
See you at 7.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.808
See you then.

38:14.693 --> 38:17.363
Mutual assured
destruction

38:17.363 --> 38:18.797
is what McNarmara
calls it.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.900
And I say,
damn right it is.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.102
Never thought
I'd look back

38:24.102 --> 38:25.637
on the world wars
as quaint.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.905
How's Tina taking it?

38:26.905 --> 38:29.074
She must be scared
out of her wits.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.509
My Tina, she's
in fourth grade,

38:30.509 --> 38:32.378
and they have her doing
duck-and-cover exercises

38:32.378 --> 38:33.545
every single day.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.881
Tell that
to Nikita Khrushchev.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.249
If you ask me, this
wouldn't be happening

38:38.249 --> 38:42.388
if Eisenhower had let him go
to Disneyland back in '59,

38:42.388 --> 38:43.655
like he wanted.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.023
Well, I don't know
about that,

38:45.023 --> 38:46.992
but I'll tell you,
I can't sleep at night.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.727
And I've tried everything:

38:48.727 --> 38:51.463
yoga, deep breathing, wine.

40:24.523 --> 40:25.924
Danke.

40:31.697 --> 40:35.200
Josef, this is Sylvia.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.570
She has looked after our
family since I was a boy.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.250
Danke.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.185
Guten Tag, Fräulein Silvia.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.223
Heil Hitler.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.923
The owner's away.
We're closed.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.827
Yes, I know.

41:39.565 --> 41:40.932
What are you--

41:40.932 --> 41:43.001
Mr. Childan could
be back any second.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.071
You missed our meeting,
Mr. McCarthy.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.075
I know. I couldn't get away.

41:51.910 --> 41:55.213
We continue to let you live
and your friend Frank live.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.582
Why?

41:58.650 --> 42:00.786
So I can be useful.

42:00.786 --> 42:03.154
And are you being useful?

42:03.154 --> 42:05.056
I told you about
the counterfeiting.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.257
That's all I know.

42:10.295 --> 42:14.199
The Yakuza's dealings are
of particular interest to us.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.734
You think they are going
to tell me anything?

42:15.734 --> 42:16.902
A gaijin?

42:19.270 --> 42:21.239
When do you make your
first payment to them?

42:23.341 --> 42:25.911
Soon, I hope.
In a few days.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.481
You will report directly
to me after that meeting.

42:30.481 --> 42:33.251
You will
recount every detail.

42:33.251 --> 42:34.853
And then we will decide

42:34.853 --> 42:37.656
if you're continuing
to be useful.

42:39.658 --> 42:41.627
I will. I swear.

42:41.627 --> 42:43.829
Now could you please--

43:28.306 --> 43:30.241
Looks nice.

43:31.777 --> 43:33.745
I didn't hear you come in.

43:35.747 --> 43:40.085
I was just saying...
it looks nice.

43:41.152 --> 43:43.454
Well, hopefully
our guest will think so,

43:43.454 --> 43:48.359
since clearly she is
the most important thing
in our lives right now.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.031
Helen.

43:56.267 --> 43:57.302
What did I say?

43:59.871 --> 44:01.506
I'm taking care of it.

44:01.506 --> 44:03.809
Trust me.

44:06.712 --> 44:08.246
I'll go check the roast.

44:13.318 --> 44:14.385
I'll get it.

44:19.457 --> 44:22.093
Hi, Miss Mills.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.228
Hello, Thomas.

44:23.228 --> 44:25.463
I thought we agreed
you'd call me Julia.

44:25.463 --> 44:27.532
I don't think
I'm supposed to.

44:27.532 --> 44:28.867
Oh, you're an adult now,
Thomas.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.435
I think
it should be fine.

44:30.435 --> 44:31.803
Julia, welcome.

44:31.803 --> 44:34.205
Thank you for having me,
Obergruppenführer.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.374
No, no, no, no.
In my home I'm John.

44:36.374 --> 44:38.744
John. Thank you.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.012
Hello, Julia.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.748
Oh, and what are those?

44:42.748 --> 44:44.149
These are for you.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.485
Wow. Beautiful.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.354
Oh, my girls.
Amy, Jennifer.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.222
- This is Miss Mills.
- Hello.

44:51.222 --> 44:53.658
Jennifer, be a dear put that
in a vase with some water.

44:53.658 --> 44:54.826
Please, come through.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.361
We'll put them
on the table.

45:40.638 --> 45:42.473
What is this?

45:42.473 --> 45:44.375
It's a memorial...

45:44.375 --> 45:46.144
for Karen.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.814
There are people here from
the state of Washington,

45:48.814 --> 45:50.816
Baja, the Salt Lake.

45:55.286 --> 45:56.487
Come on.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.670
As we gather tonight,

46:12.670 --> 46:17.208
we remember that the Lord
is close to the brokenhearted

46:17.208 --> 46:21.112
and saves those that
are crushed in spirit.

46:21.112 --> 46:25.083
Remember too, that we
are of good courage

46:25.083 --> 46:27.853
and would rather be
away from the body

46:27.853 --> 46:29.454
and at home with the Lord

46:29.454 --> 46:33.024
surrounded by the loved ones
who went before us.

46:41.199 --> 46:45.003
Of course, the Lord can see
Karen, even though we cannot.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.873
For precious
in the sight of the Lord

46:47.873 --> 46:50.008
is the death of his saints.

46:50.008 --> 46:53.979
So let us lay this
saint to rest.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.447
And let us not linger,
children,

46:56.447 --> 47:00.185
for the wolves will soon
be upon our door.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.526
You're one of us now.

47:34.652 --> 47:36.654
The pot roast is delicious.

47:36.654 --> 47:38.789
Mm. Very good.

47:38.789 --> 47:41.059
Why, thank you.

47:41.059 --> 47:42.994
You know, this
tastes a little bit

47:42.994 --> 47:44.930
like pickled cabbage,
is that right?

47:44.930 --> 47:46.164
Is that what it is?

47:46.164 --> 47:48.233
We like to call it
sauerkraut.

47:48.233 --> 47:50.401
- This is sauerkraut?
- Yep.

47:50.401 --> 47:51.836
You've never had
sauerkraut before?

47:51.836 --> 47:53.371
No, I haven't.
It's a little hard

47:53.371 --> 47:55.440
to come by
in the Pacific States.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.541
Colleen Meyer said

47:56.541 --> 47:59.077
that the Japs eat dogs
in the Pacific States.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.946
- Is that true?
- Jennifer.

48:00.946 --> 48:03.748
No. The Japanese do not
eat dogs, I promise.

48:03.748 --> 48:05.283
What about cats?

48:06.551 --> 48:07.652
Occasionally.

48:09.955 --> 48:10.956
Kidding.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.064
Excuse me.

48:27.805 --> 48:29.674
You know what I did
hear, girls--

48:29.674 --> 48:31.977
that they eat raw fish.

48:33.778 --> 48:35.213
Yes?

48:35.213 --> 48:36.982
Did you know?

48:39.617 --> 48:41.352
Just tell me the truth.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.655
It's good
to hear from you, Joe.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.457
How's Berlin?

48:48.259 --> 48:50.228
Did you know
I'm Lebensborn?

48:53.731 --> 48:55.133
Yes, I knew.

49:04.609 --> 49:05.810
Why didn't you tell me?

49:05.810 --> 49:07.245
It wasn't my place.

49:07.245 --> 49:10.648
You mean because
it didn't benefit you.

49:10.648 --> 49:13.018
That's the only reason
you ever do anything,

49:13.018 --> 49:14.219
isn't it?

49:14.219 --> 49:17.088
What I did
I did for you, Joe.

49:17.088 --> 49:19.424
You have a great future
ahead of you.

49:19.424 --> 49:21.492
And you thought I'd
be useful to you.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.828
Well, you're important
to me, Joe.

49:23.828 --> 49:26.431
I won't deny that.

49:26.431 --> 49:28.066
We're done.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.300
Everything okay, honey?

50:03.734 --> 50:05.403
Everything's fine.

50:47.178 --> 50:50.415
Mr. Washington.
Right on time.

50:50.415 --> 50:52.750
You about ready to go,
Mr. A?

50:52.750 --> 50:54.452
There's a stack inside.

50:54.452 --> 50:57.488
Would you bring it out
for me, please?

50:57.488 --> 51:00.725
Don't want to get that nice
suit all rumpled up, huh?

51:00.725 --> 51:01.726
Mm-mm.

51:17.542 --> 51:18.643
There's a...

51:19.610 --> 51:21.679
There's a strong smell
inside.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.848
- You noticed.
- Like gas.

51:30.621 --> 51:32.757
That's the smell
of leaving, Lem,

51:32.757 --> 51:34.425
the smell of moving on.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.262
What about the rest of them?

51:43.268 --> 51:47.205
Nothing like a good
spring cleaning.

53:49.594 --> 53:50.995
Noriaki?

53:57.735 --> 53:59.003
Wow.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.571
You're back.

54:02.740 --> 54:05.310
Why do you talk to me
this way?

54:05.310 --> 54:06.777
Why do you dishonor Mom?

54:06.777 --> 54:08.045
Noriaki, please.

54:08.045 --> 54:09.447
No, he needs
to hear this.

54:11.349 --> 54:13.718
The world's about
to come to an end,

54:13.718 --> 54:16.321
and you disappear
on another one
of your benders?

54:16.321 --> 54:19.324
I did not do what you say.

54:30.368 --> 54:32.603
Nori?

54:35.340 --> 54:36.941
He's back, honey.

54:38.976 --> 54:40.345
Oh.

54:45.249 --> 54:47.518
Thank God you're all right.
