WEBVTT

01:12.935 --> 01:15.521
Mr. Taransky...?

01:15.605 --> 01:17.398
She's...

01:17.480 --> 01:19.567
She's walking?

01:19.650 --> 01:21.569
Don't tell me
she's walking.

01:21.652 --> 01:23.404
She can't walk.

01:24.780 --> 01:28.366
- Nicola!
- This, this...

01:28.450 --> 01:29.743
- not this.
- Nicola!

01:29.784 --> 01:31.912
- How was your massage?
- You're in breach.

01:31.995 --> 01:34.248
- Cigarette.
- Is this about the new pages?

01:34.332 --> 01:35.916
Because I made
the changes,

01:35.999 --> 01:37.751
all the changes
you wanted.

01:37.834 --> 01:40.212
You are virtually
in every scene.

01:40.295 --> 01:43.256
It is not the size
of the role, Viktor.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.884
Am I, or am I not
entitled

01:45.967 --> 01:48.762
to the biggest trailer
on the lot? Hmm?

01:48.845 --> 01:51.056
It's the biggest
on earth.

01:51.139 --> 01:52.891
I swear.

01:52.974 --> 01:54.767
It's a 50-foot
Airstream.

01:54.808 --> 01:56.769
They don't make them
any longer.

01:56.810 --> 01:59.105
- Taller, Viktor.
- Taller?

01:59.147 --> 02:00.774
- Taller!
- What?

02:00.857 --> 02:02.691
Eh.

02:05.236 --> 02:07.446
You've insulted me
for the last time.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.406
You're right.
It's actually--

02:09.448 --> 02:10.366
It's actually taller.

02:10.407 --> 02:12.368
- You're right. It's amazing.
- Coffee!

02:12.409 --> 02:14.495
Wait a minute.

02:14.578 --> 02:17.081
The tires are
overinflated.

02:17.122 --> 02:19.083
See? It's just this.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.711
See? Look. Here.

02:23.753 --> 02:25.756
- The air comes right out.
- This is sad.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.716
See? It's lower already.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.051
Nicola, I beg you.
Don't do this to me.

02:30.134 --> 02:32.387
You know,
I had three other offers.

02:32.470 --> 02:34.389
I only signed on
to this picture...

02:34.472 --> 02:37.225
- out of loyalty.
- Well, then show me some.

02:37.308 --> 02:38.810
They're going
to shut me down!

02:38.893 --> 02:40.728
It's not working, Viktor.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.564
I mean, my God!

02:42.605 --> 02:44.899
The scene
with the thousand geese?!

02:44.983 --> 02:47.067
I don't understand
this film!

02:47.150 --> 02:50.195
Nobody is going
to understand this film.

02:50.279 --> 02:53.116
I already put out a press release
citing creative differences.

02:53.199 --> 02:55.118
So just let it go.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.077
You went to the press?

02:57.119 --> 02:58.996
Do we have everything?

02:59.037 --> 03:00.873
All right.
You know what?

03:00.956 --> 03:02.332
You're right.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.043
You are right.
And when you're right, you're right.

03:05.127 --> 03:07.171
- Thank you.
- Let me help you with these.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.006
'Cause you oughta go.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.008
- I don't deserve you.
- Oh.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.010
This film doesn't
deserve you.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.387
It deserves much,
much better than you!

03:16.429 --> 03:18.015
Creative differences?

03:18.098 --> 03:20.184
The difference is
you're not creative.

03:25.771 --> 03:27.690
To hell, please.

03:41.953 --> 03:43.413
Jack?

03:44.624 --> 03:46.876
Jack, are you there?

03:46.959 --> 03:48.544
She's good.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.588
You can hardly tell
she's reading off a teleprompter.

03:51.588 --> 03:53.048
I'm right here.

03:54.299 --> 03:56.009
Right beside you.

03:59.930 --> 04:00.805
Look.

04:02.140 --> 04:03.683
I've analyzed this footage.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.186
We've got everything
we need in the can already.

04:06.228 --> 04:08.479
If I could just make
the proper adjustments,

04:08.562 --> 04:11.733
we can finish
this film without her.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.736
Viktor, according to the writ
her attorneys filed at noon today,

04:14.778 --> 04:18.279
they'll sue if the film is released
with Nicola in a single frame.

04:18.363 --> 04:20.574
They will sue, Viktor.
They're serious.

04:20.658 --> 04:21.992
So let's recast.

04:22.076 --> 04:24.371
Nicola Anders is
the only actress in the world

04:24.412 --> 04:25.663
that could play that part.

04:25.704 --> 04:27.706
- It's a remake, Hal.
- That's right.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.917
Nicola Anders is not
bigger than this picture.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.294
Of course she is, Viktor.

04:32.378 --> 04:34.254
No other name is going
to sign on now.

04:34.337 --> 04:36.882
Who needs a name?
We'll cast an unknown.

04:36.966 --> 04:39.009
I'm not going to play
opposite an unknown.

04:39.093 --> 04:41.887
- We can't sell an unknown.
- The numbers don't work.

04:41.929 --> 04:45.056
If we ever want to be in
the Nicola Anders business again,

04:45.139 --> 04:47.600
we have to cut our losses
and shelve the picture.

04:47.684 --> 04:49.185
No!

04:49.269 --> 04:51.355
I will not give in to that
blackmailing--

04:51.438 --> 04:53.106
Viktor,
let's take a walk.

04:53.147 --> 04:54.941
Ridiculous performance.

04:54.983 --> 04:56.818
I told you she was bad.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.653
No, yours in there.

04:58.736 --> 05:01.905
Why do you always have to make
things so difficult for yourself?

05:01.989 --> 05:04.492
Difficult?
I'm being difficult?

05:04.576 --> 05:06.077
Yes. Mm-hmm.

05:07.412 --> 05:10.289
Elaine, do you know
what these are?

05:10.330 --> 05:12.457
Mike 'n' Ike's?

05:12.541 --> 05:14.084
They're not just any
Mike 'n' Ike's,

05:14.168 --> 05:15.627
These are cherry
Mike 'n' Ike's.

05:15.711 --> 05:18.006
Do you know why I,
Viktor Taransky,

05:18.089 --> 05:20.174
two-time Academy Award
nominated director--

05:20.215 --> 05:22.134
Viktor, that was "Short Subject."

05:22.217 --> 05:25.554
--overseeing the most cherished
movie project of my entire career,

05:25.637 --> 05:27.514
am walking around with--
look, look, look...

05:27.598 --> 05:29.516
pockets full
of these... things?!

05:29.600 --> 05:31.768
I have a feeling
you're going to tell me.

05:31.810 --> 05:35.314
I'm going to tell you why.
Because Ms. Nicola Anders,

05:35.397 --> 05:37.356
supermodel
with a SAG card,

05:37.440 --> 05:39.609
has it written
in her contract

05:39.650 --> 05:41.569
that all cherry
Mike 'n' Ike's

05:41.652 --> 05:43.197
be removed
from her candy dish,

05:43.280 --> 05:46.491
along with strict instructions
that any room she walks into

05:46.574 --> 05:49.202
must have seven packs
of cigarettes waiting for her--

05:49.285 --> 05:50.620
three of them opened;

05:50.703 --> 05:53.206
that there be
a personal Jacuzzi

05:53.247 --> 05:55.708
within 80 paces
of her dressing room;

05:55.750 --> 05:57.710
and that any time
she travels,

05:57.752 --> 06:00.129
her nanny must fly
with her first-class.

06:00.213 --> 06:02.131
So, what's wrong
with that?

06:02.173 --> 06:03.965
Elaine, she doesn't
have children.

06:04.007 --> 06:06.426
Don't you see?
They're mocking us.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.553
They're mocking--
we're at their mercy.

06:08.638 --> 06:11.599
What happened?
I mean, we always had movie stars,

06:11.641 --> 06:13.975
but they used to be
our stars, remember?

06:14.017 --> 06:16.311
We were the ones who would
tell them what to do.

06:16.394 --> 06:18.146
And we would tell them
what to wear,

06:18.230 --> 06:20.148
- who to date--
- That's what you want?!

06:20.232 --> 06:21.817
When they
were under contract to us,

06:21.900 --> 06:24.319
we could change their names
if we wanted to.

06:24.361 --> 06:25.821
- More than once.
- Viktor,

06:25.904 --> 06:27.447
do you realize
you're nostalgic

06:27.531 --> 06:29.366
for an era you weren't
even born in?!

06:29.449 --> 06:31.867
I do remember why I got
into this business.

06:31.951 --> 06:34.913
- You seem to have forgotten.
- Oh, please. Come on.

06:34.996 --> 06:36.998
New York-- Cassavetes.
Remember?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.834
- Here we go.
- What were we doing?

06:38.917 --> 06:40.960
We were trying to make
something important.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.127
I don't know.

06:42.211 --> 06:44.630
Shine a little light
in that darkened cinema.

06:44.713 --> 06:46.423
It's called a projector.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.801
Illuminate hearts and minds
with a ray of truth.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.719
I thought that's
what we were doing.

06:50.803 --> 06:54.181
I have good memories
of those days, too.

06:54.265 --> 06:56.267
I do, but this isn't
about that--

06:56.350 --> 06:57.475
or you, or me,

06:57.559 --> 06:59.811
or some high-minded ideal.
This is business.

06:59.894 --> 07:01.313
- Spare me.
- Look around.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.315
Who do you think pays
for all of this?

07:03.315 --> 07:05.109
This is about investment
and return.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.860
I'm not interested
in investment and return!

07:06.943 --> 07:08.736
I'm not interested
in who pays for anything!

07:08.820 --> 07:10.947
I'm trying to make a movie!

07:11.030 --> 07:13.700
I'm responsible
for this, Viktor.

07:13.783 --> 07:15.493
Those days
in New York...

07:17.537 --> 07:19.789
It's over, Viktor.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.714
You're not renewing
my contract?

07:27.797 --> 07:29.716
How can I?!

07:29.799 --> 07:32.886
Your last three pictures tanked.

07:32.968 --> 07:35.304
No bankable star is going
to work with you after this.

07:35.387 --> 07:37.806
I mean, if you just
compromised a little.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.770
Well, it's not every day
you're fired

07:43.812 --> 07:45.647
by the mother
of your own child.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.777
You and I both know
that I kept you on

07:50.818 --> 07:53.321
after the divorce
for old time's sake.

07:53.404 --> 07:56.492
And so you could still hold
your head up in front of Lainey.

07:56.575 --> 07:59.328
- I fought for you.
- Yeah, well...

08:08.003 --> 08:09.754
I'm sorry, Viktor.

08:35.363 --> 08:36.780
Dad!

08:38.657 --> 08:40.659
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.

08:42.202 --> 08:43.953
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

08:45.204 --> 08:46.957
I'm sorry Mom canned you.

08:48.708 --> 08:50.710
I'm going to finish
this picture.

08:50.794 --> 08:53.171
Lainey, I'm going
to finish it.

08:54.713 --> 08:56.966
Because it's important.

08:58.175 --> 09:00.220
I know you will, Dad.

09:00.303 --> 09:02.138
You're Viktor Taransky.

09:03.305 --> 09:04.932
I'm Viktor Taransky.

09:07.434 --> 09:09.895
'Kay.
Bye, Dad.

09:16.652 --> 09:18.445
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mom.

09:18.529 --> 09:19.989
Are you okay?

09:20.072 --> 09:22.282
I'm Viktor Taransky.

09:35.170 --> 09:37.088
Mr. Taransky?

09:37.172 --> 09:38.965
Mr. Taransky,
thank God.

09:39.048 --> 09:40.258
I've been trying
to see you.

09:40.341 --> 09:42.427
I've been calling.

09:42.510 --> 09:44.470
Your assistant
won't put me through.

09:44.512 --> 09:46.723
I told her it was a matter
of life and death.

09:46.806 --> 09:49.266
I was afraid I wasn't going
to get to you in time.

09:49.349 --> 09:51.477
Please, just...

09:51.518 --> 09:53.438
- Keep your distance.
- I did it!

09:53.521 --> 09:54.439
I did it!

09:54.522 --> 09:56.482
I licked skin,
I licked hair,

09:56.565 --> 09:59.693
- I licked every part of her.
- I'm going to call security.

09:59.735 --> 10:01.778
I'll call security
if you don't back off.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.281
I have her,
Mr. Taransky.

10:04.364 --> 10:06.408
The answer
to your prayers.

10:06.492 --> 10:09.786
- The answer to this.
- I was misquoted.

10:09.828 --> 10:11.997
I have your new leading-lady
right here.

10:12.039 --> 10:14.624
In my pants.

10:16.876 --> 10:18.837
Please, sir,
I don't know you.

10:18.879 --> 10:22.132
- I don't know where you come from--
- It's me!

10:22.216 --> 10:24.133
Mr. Taransky, don't--

10:24.217 --> 10:25.843
Don't you recognize me?

10:25.885 --> 10:29.305
The Future of Film Conference
in San Jose.

10:29.347 --> 10:31.265
Remember that?
Hank.

10:31.349 --> 10:33.351
Hank Aleno.

10:33.434 --> 10:35.645
I was a keynote speaker.
You must remember my speech.

10:35.728 --> 10:37.772
- "Who Needs Humans?"
- Right.

10:39.065 --> 10:40.982
You were booed off
the stage.

10:41.066 --> 10:43.985
- Whoa, that's got to be...
- Eight years ago.

10:44.027 --> 10:46.280
And that whole time
I never left my computer.

10:46.364 --> 10:48.324
Uh-huh.
Good for you, Hank.

10:48.407 --> 10:50.116
Well, it's good
and bad.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.118
That's what caused this.
The eye tumor.

10:52.202 --> 10:54.955
- Microwaves from the screen.
- I'm sorry.

10:54.996 --> 10:56.873
Don't be,
because it was worth it.

10:59.084 --> 11:00.502
You have to see her.

11:00.544 --> 11:02.295
Oh, I've seen those.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.506
- Not like this.
- I'll take care of that.

11:04.548 --> 11:07.133
Yeah, well, you're talking
about a "syn-thespian."

11:07.175 --> 11:10.302
- A virtual actor.
- No, we call them "vac-tors."

11:10.386 --> 11:12.180
"Vac-tors"?
I need flesh.

11:12.264 --> 11:13.765
- Flesh is weak.
- It can't be done.

11:13.849 --> 11:16.309
It can be done.
With my new computer code,

11:16.393 --> 11:18.144
it can be done.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.771
You and me...

11:20.855 --> 11:22.565
we can do this together.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.442
I don't know anything
about computers.

11:24.526 --> 11:28.112
See, that's why--
that's why you're so perfect.

11:28.195 --> 11:30.447
You have something...

11:30.531 --> 11:32.950
- that I don't have.
- What's that?

11:34.201 --> 11:35.827
An eye.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.122
An eye for performance.

11:38.205 --> 11:40.124
You know the truth
when you see it.

11:40.207 --> 11:42.418
I know.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.044
I mean, I've seen
your movies.

11:45.128 --> 11:46.963
I love your movies.

11:48.214 --> 11:51.093
- You love my movies?
- "Straw God."

11:52.719 --> 11:54.637
That changed my life.

11:54.721 --> 11:57.015
You saw "Straw God"?

11:57.056 --> 12:00.018
I have seen every frame
of your work.

12:01.144 --> 12:02.936
You're the only
filmmaker

12:03.020 --> 12:04.981
with the artistic
integrity...

12:06.858 --> 12:08.651
to realize my vision.

12:10.944 --> 12:13.280
You and me,
art and science--

12:14.698 --> 12:16.366
We're the perfect
marriage.

12:16.450 --> 12:18.620
Hank...

12:18.661 --> 12:20.454
I've had
a rough day today.

12:20.537 --> 12:22.122
But, I tell you what,

12:22.206 --> 12:24.708
I'll call you
about this next week.

12:24.791 --> 12:27.503
- We can talk.
- I won't be here in a week.

12:27.586 --> 12:30.547
- The tumor is inoperable.
- I'll call you about it, okay?

12:30.631 --> 12:33.634
That's what I'm trying to say.
The tumor is inoperable.

12:34.885 --> 12:36.595
I'll be dead.

12:39.347 --> 12:41.390
Well, I'm already dead.

12:49.565 --> 12:51.150
Call me!

12:51.234 --> 12:53.653
This week!

12:55.403 --> 12:57.156
Please.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.925
What do you mean
she won't work with me?

13:17.008 --> 13:18.760
She's done nothing.

13:18.844 --> 13:21.263
She doesn't have
a single credit to her name.

13:21.346 --> 13:23.598
Better no credits
than a Taransky credit.

13:23.682 --> 13:25.433
Art,
you don't understand.

13:25.517 --> 13:28.019
I've mortgaged everything
to finish this film.

13:28.103 --> 13:29.938
The creditors
are calling me.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.939
They're at the door
for God's sake.

13:31.981 --> 13:34.775
Hello?

13:36.027 --> 13:37.445
Damn it!

13:39.655 --> 13:41.615
Mr. Taransky.

13:43.659 --> 13:45.870
Mr. Taransky!

13:52.042 --> 13:55.045
- Mr. Taransky!
- No, I'm not him!

13:55.129 --> 13:57.797
- Mr. Taransky!
- I'm not him!

13:57.881 --> 13:58.965
Mr. Taransky!

13:59.048 --> 14:01.217
Hank Aleno!

14:04.972 --> 14:08.057
I represent the estate
of Mr. Hank Aleno.

14:09.309 --> 14:12.562
It was his last wish
that you have this.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.568
What is it?

14:18.651 --> 14:20.236
I have no idea.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.821
He wanted you
to have it.

15:54.827 --> 15:56.579
Valarie!

15:58.330 --> 15:59.790
Valarie!

16:05.129 --> 16:06.839
Valarie!

16:11.051 --> 16:13.888
Valarie,
what are you running from?

16:13.929 --> 16:16.056
From Valarie.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.978
Valarie, no!

16:34.157 --> 16:35.950
Jack, are you there?

16:38.785 --> 16:41.706
Something like this
can happen and what...

16:41.790 --> 16:44.626
was it for?

16:44.709 --> 16:46.252
Why are we here?

16:47.461 --> 16:49.797
Is that what
you're asking, Jack?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.174
Why are we here?

16:54.469 --> 16:56.345
No why...

16:57.805 --> 16:59.348
just here.

17:01.517 --> 17:03.685
Just here.

17:33.798 --> 17:36.551
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

17:36.634 --> 17:39.720
I know I may be guilty
of a crime,

17:41.263 --> 17:44.307
but it was committed with
the purest of intentions.

17:44.391 --> 17:47.395
I wanted to send a message

17:47.478 --> 17:49.397
to the acting community

17:49.480 --> 17:51.231
who...

17:51.314 --> 17:53.525
put themselves above
the work,

17:53.608 --> 17:56.111
who put themselves above me.

17:56.153 --> 17:57.696
So, what did
you guys think?

17:57.779 --> 17:59.906
So fake.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.242
Totally artificial.

18:06.371 --> 18:09.498
Like we're suppose to believe
that was 19th century Lisbon.

18:09.582 --> 18:11.333
- Come on.
- Guys...

18:11.418 --> 18:13.837
Who's looking at the sets
when she's on screen?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.338
Oh, yeah.

18:17.590 --> 18:18.924
There he is.

18:19.008 --> 18:20.843
That's my dad,
Viktor Taransky.

18:24.723 --> 18:27.641
- She was magnificent.
- She's absolutely unreal.

18:27.683 --> 18:29.351
Breathtaking.

18:29.435 --> 18:31.687
She wasn't too...
cartoony, or anything?

18:31.770 --> 18:32.730
The nun?

18:32.771 --> 18:34.606
Or are you talking about
the mother?

18:34.689 --> 18:37.567
A star like that, who cares about
the supporting cast?

18:37.650 --> 18:40.112
Congratulations again.
She's not of this earth.

18:40.196 --> 18:43.115
- You should be very proud.
- Oh, not of this earth.

18:44.574 --> 18:46.785
And the rest of the film,
what did you think?

18:46.826 --> 18:49.662
She's a miracle.
Where did you find her?

18:49.746 --> 18:51.081
Well...

18:51.165 --> 18:54.793
I saw her picture...
on the computer.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.085
A computer?

18:57.504 --> 19:00.924
You really didn't notice
anything unusual about her?

19:01.007 --> 19:03.050
Only her brilliance.
To be honest,

19:03.133 --> 19:04.385
with what you had
to work with,

19:04.469 --> 19:06.304
I was expecting
a train wreck.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.890
- You really pulled it off.
- I did?

19:08.973 --> 19:12.351
Yeah. I have a feeling Mom's
going to take you back after this.

19:14.269 --> 19:16.522
Back on the lot.
That's what--

19:16.605 --> 19:18.274
I know. I know.
Come on, let's go.

19:19.942 --> 19:23.612
A dazzling new ingenue
has come from seemingly nowhere

19:23.654 --> 19:25.614
to capture the hearts of movie-going
audiences around the world

19:25.656 --> 19:27.574
to capture the hearts of movie-going
audiences around the world

19:27.658 --> 19:31.036
in her debut film
"Sunrise, Sunset."

19:31.078 --> 19:33.163
But who is Simone?

19:33.247 --> 19:34.957
We know so little about her.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.375
And why the secrecy?

19:37.458 --> 19:40.253
All we know for sure
is that she was discovered

19:40.336 --> 19:42.672
by little-known director,
Viktor Tarinsky.

19:42.755 --> 19:44.633
Taransky.

19:50.638 --> 19:52.223
Simone!

19:52.306 --> 19:54.225
Simone?

19:54.308 --> 19:56.936
- Good to see you, too, Elaine.
- Where is she?

19:57.019 --> 19:59.689
- She's not here.
- Why isn't she with you?

19:59.772 --> 20:02.775
Why? Because she would never come
to something like this.

20:02.859 --> 20:04.442
She's intensely private.

20:04.484 --> 20:06.653
Back to work, everyone.
She's not here.

20:06.695 --> 20:08.864
Hey, listen.
Have you read the reviews?

20:08.947 --> 20:10.491
They're love letters.

20:10.575 --> 20:13.869
Listen to this one.
Oh, here.

20:13.910 --> 20:17.122
Simone has the voice
of a young Jane Fonda,

20:17.164 --> 20:18.915
the body
of Sophia Loren,

20:18.999 --> 20:20.959
the grace of well,
Grace Kelly--

20:21.001 --> 20:23.712
ha-ha--
and the face...

20:23.795 --> 20:26.131
of Audrey Hepburn
combined with an angel.

20:27.382 --> 20:29.801
- Almost right.
- I can't wait to meet her.

20:29.843 --> 20:31.969
Oh, I don't know
if that's going to happen.

20:32.052 --> 20:34.096
Why not?

20:34.180 --> 20:36.391
She is somewhat
of a recluse.

20:36.475 --> 20:38.518
That's how she stays
so pure.

20:38.602 --> 20:41.645
She isolates herself
in her art.

20:41.729 --> 20:43.647
Viktor, it's my studio.

20:43.731 --> 20:45.774
Elaine, it's my actor.

20:45.858 --> 20:48.569
There are other studios.

20:48.652 --> 20:50.529
There's only one Simone.

20:50.571 --> 20:52.948
Okay, have it your way,
Viktor.

21:01.831 --> 21:02.917
Hello, Walter.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.585
Nobody came in
or went out,

21:04.668 --> 21:06.753
- just like you said.
- Very good.

21:06.836 --> 21:08.755
- Mr. Taransky?
- Yes?

21:08.838 --> 21:11.800
Is Ms. Simone
coming in today?

21:13.343 --> 21:16.262
She's already here.
She arrived before you got here.

21:16.304 --> 21:18.681
She's going to leave
long after you're gone.

21:18.723 --> 21:20.600
Remember,
under no circumstances

21:20.683 --> 21:23.686
are you or anybody else
ever to enter this set

21:23.770 --> 21:26.146
without my express
permission, understood?

21:26.230 --> 21:27.648
Yes, sir.

21:27.731 --> 21:29.567
Mr. Taransky?

21:29.651 --> 21:31.861
What if it catches
on fire?

21:33.821 --> 21:35.364
Let it burn.

22:20.657 --> 22:22.493
Good morning, Simone.

22:25.496 --> 22:27.622
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.

22:33.795 --> 22:37.215
Simone, a star is...

22:37.299 --> 22:39.926
digitized.

22:39.968 --> 22:41.887
Do you know
what this means?

22:41.970 --> 22:44.930
We have stepped
into a new dimension.

22:46.182 --> 22:49.102
Our ability
to manufacture fraud

22:49.186 --> 22:52.772
now exceeds our ability
to detect it.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.358
I am the death of real.

22:58.527 --> 23:00.530
...death of real.

23:00.614 --> 23:02.657
...death of real.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.413
Too much Meryl Streep.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.588
A little less Streep.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.716
And a little more...

23:23.134 --> 23:24.803
Bacall.

23:24.886 --> 23:28.015
Is this better,
Mr. Taransky?

23:28.057 --> 23:30.016
Much.

23:30.099 --> 23:31.559
While we're at it,

23:31.643 --> 23:33.561
there's a little
something

23:33.645 --> 23:35.980
I want to add
to your repertoire.

23:37.107 --> 23:39.316
You've got the wrong
Holly Golightly.

23:39.399 --> 23:42.070
Remember that thing
Audrey Hepburn does

23:42.153 --> 23:44.030
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

23:49.993 --> 23:51.578
How do I look?

23:59.169 --> 24:00.629
Give me Audrey.

24:00.671 --> 24:02.422
How do I look?

24:03.590 --> 24:05.217
Perfect.

24:05.259 --> 24:07.845
Perfect, Simone.

24:07.928 --> 24:09.346
Perfect.

24:11.056 --> 24:12.891
Oh, God.

24:14.101 --> 24:16.519
I'm so relaxed
around you.

24:19.940 --> 24:21.984
I'm so myself.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.865
You did create me.

24:28.948 --> 24:32.869
I just brought someone
else's dream to life.

24:35.079 --> 24:36.414
Mr. Taransky,

24:36.497 --> 24:40.251
we both know I was nothing
without you.

24:40.293 --> 24:42.544
I was computer code.

24:42.627 --> 24:45.213
I was ones and zeros.

24:45.297 --> 24:47.091
I was nothing.

24:48.551 --> 24:51.386
Well...

24:51.470 --> 24:53.388
that's true.

24:53.472 --> 24:56.224
I don't want
to boast, but...

24:56.308 --> 24:59.895
Are you ever going to tell
the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?

25:01.188 --> 25:03.148
I'm going tell
the truth about you.

25:03.231 --> 25:05.358
Why wouldn't i?

25:05.442 --> 25:07.819
Of course...

25:07.861 --> 25:10.488
with Hank's tragic passing,

25:12.240 --> 25:13.825
his secret did die
with him.

25:17.328 --> 25:19.872
This is
a classic case of

25:19.955 --> 25:23.876
technology in search
of an artist.

25:25.712 --> 25:27.546
Someone with integrity,

25:27.588 --> 25:30.007
someone with vision,
someone who can see.

25:31.258 --> 25:34.720
See beyond
this irrational

25:34.803 --> 25:36.346
allegiance
to flesh and blood.

25:36.429 --> 25:37.972
Someone who can see

25:38.056 --> 25:41.018
that with the rise
in the price of a real actor

25:41.102 --> 25:43.853
and the fall in the price
of a fake,

25:43.937 --> 25:46.856
that the scales have tipped--

25:46.940 --> 25:49.025
naturally in favor
of the fake.

25:53.113 --> 25:54.864
Someone who can see

25:54.906 --> 25:57.158
that if a performance
is genuine,

25:58.326 --> 26:00.537
it doesn't matter
if the actor's real or not.

26:02.579 --> 26:05.333
And what's real anymore?

26:05.375 --> 26:07.335
Most actors these days

26:07.377 --> 26:09.337
have digital work done
to them.

26:10.879 --> 26:12.381
It's a gray area.

26:14.424 --> 26:16.343
The only real truth
is the work.

26:18.429 --> 26:20.556
I'm going to tell
the truth about you

26:20.639 --> 26:23.016
after your next picture.

26:28.938 --> 26:30.690
You're so beautiful.

26:37.572 --> 26:39.532
You're too beautiful.

26:43.619 --> 26:45.372
We're going to fix that.

27:06.308 --> 27:08.226
Is this on?

27:09.978 --> 27:13.899
I will not be taking any questions
regarding Simone.

27:13.982 --> 27:15.942
I do, however,
have a statement

27:16.026 --> 27:17.861
to read on her behalf.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.992
"To Whom it May Concern:

27:24.034 --> 27:26.620
I'm deeply grateful
for the extraordinary

27:26.661 --> 27:29.623
public response
to Mr. Taransky's film.

27:29.664 --> 27:33.000
At this time I will be
conducting no interviews,

27:33.083 --> 27:35.586
or making
publicity appearances--

27:35.669 --> 27:39.466
- This is unbelievable.
- I politely request that the press

27:39.508 --> 27:43.844
respect my privacy and let
the work speak for itself.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.721
Yours truly, Simone."

27:45.763 --> 27:48.307
Viktor!
Who is Simone dating?!

27:48.390 --> 27:50.184
Where did you find her?

27:50.267 --> 27:53.312
- Is Simone her real name?
- Didn't I make it clear?

27:53.395 --> 27:55.189
No questions
regarding Simone.

27:55.231 --> 27:57.399
We're just trying
to get some answers.

27:57.441 --> 27:59.442
I will make
my final statement.

27:59.526 --> 28:03.989
Ms. Simone begins production
on her new film today--

28:04.073 --> 28:06.075
"Eternity Forever."

28:06.117 --> 28:09.160
This is a project
which has been near and dear

28:09.244 --> 28:12.330
to my heart since I wrote it

28:12.413 --> 28:14.124
nine years ago.

28:16.876 --> 28:18.211
Thank you.

28:18.294 --> 28:20.713
Would you answer
a question regarding Hank?

28:26.718 --> 28:29.139
Hank?
Who asked me about Hank?

28:29.222 --> 28:32.934
Funny, why is the movie
dedicated to Hank?

28:33.017 --> 28:34.601
Are they involved?

28:37.563 --> 28:41.650
They were at one time
inseparable. Yes.

28:44.069 --> 28:45.487
And now?

28:45.529 --> 28:47.531
Now...

28:47.614 --> 28:50.451
sadly to say,
only in spirit.

28:51.909 --> 28:53.619
Thank you.

29:16.350 --> 29:19.102
Your car will be ready
in just a minute.

29:19.186 --> 29:21.104
We gave you
a complimentary car wash.

29:21.188 --> 29:23.274
- Oh, really?
- They're cleaning the engine now.

29:23.357 --> 29:25.109
Thank you.

29:27.195 --> 29:29.446
- Viktor, hey.
- Hal.

29:29.529 --> 29:31.448
I am so happy for us.

29:31.531 --> 29:33.158
The film, the chemistry.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.786
Nothing against
Nicola Anders,

29:34.869 --> 29:36.953
but I think
that Simone and I,

29:37.037 --> 29:38.997
we really worked
great together.

29:39.039 --> 29:42.209
- You were never together.
- Still, the connection was undeniable.

29:42.292 --> 29:43.794
You can't--

29:43.877 --> 29:45.836
Look, I have not read
"Eternity Forever,"

29:45.878 --> 29:47.463
but it is fantastic.

29:47.546 --> 29:49.966
And I know I would be perfect
for the part of Clive.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.510
- Clyde.
- Clyde, right.

29:51.551 --> 29:53.637
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes, perfect.

29:53.678 --> 29:55.763
Come on, man.

29:55.846 --> 29:58.140
Look, I ran into Simone
on the lot.

29:58.224 --> 29:59.975
- Really?
- Yes, really.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.145
- She never mentioned it.
- She's busy right now.

30:02.229 --> 30:03.729
People coming at her
from all angles.

30:03.813 --> 30:05.648
Maybe she didn't want
you to know, huh?

30:07.733 --> 30:08.984
I strongly sensed

30:09.026 --> 30:12.070
that she thought I would be
perfect for Clyde as well.

30:12.153 --> 30:13.613
- Really?
- Strongly.

30:13.655 --> 30:15.116
Excuse me.

30:15.199 --> 30:16.492
Sure.

30:16.575 --> 30:18.494
Hello?

30:18.577 --> 30:20.995
Simone, it's so great
to hear from you.

30:21.037 --> 30:22.497
How are you,
sweetheart?

30:22.580 --> 30:25.166
You'll never guess
who I'm with.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.838
- You met him on the lot the other day.
- It was more in passing.

30:28.921 --> 30:30.505
No, you're not
even close.

30:30.588 --> 30:32.757
Hal.

30:32.841 --> 30:35.343
- Hal Sinclair.
- What's wrong now?

30:35.427 --> 30:38.346
I'm getting nothing from her side
of the conversation.

30:38.388 --> 30:40.305
No, I don't think
he put on weight.

30:40.389 --> 30:43.935
Anyway, listen. Do you think he'd
be right for "Eternity Forever"?

30:44.018 --> 30:45.937
He's not the right type?

30:46.020 --> 30:48.188
You want to go
in another direction?

30:48.188 --> 30:50.941
Well... we'll try and talk her
into it, don't worry.

30:51.024 --> 30:52.609
Anything you can do.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.238
- Anything.
- Yeah, listen, honey.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.239
What is this,
some kind of jamming device?

30:57.281 --> 30:59.074
This is a bad place to talk.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.702
Maybe he's just
talking to himself.

31:01.785 --> 31:03.912
Taransky's not
that good an actor.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.122
Honey, I know you want
to do charity work.

31:06.205 --> 31:09.251
No, they've taken
special precautions.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.545
Some kind
of new encryption.

31:11.628 --> 31:13.630
Why would they do that?

31:17.133 --> 31:19.135
Well, whatever it is...

31:19.218 --> 31:21.221
it's dark.

31:22.556 --> 31:24.223
Dark?

31:24.307 --> 31:26.851
Yeah. Very.

31:26.934 --> 31:28.436
All right,
we'll talk about it

31:28.519 --> 31:30.855
at the beach house
this weekend.

31:38.404 --> 31:41.448
- Can you ever stop doing that?
- Why?

31:41.531 --> 31:43.033
You'll lose yourself
in that thing.

31:43.116 --> 31:45.786
You gotta get out more.
How you gonna meet boys?

31:45.869 --> 31:48.164
Dad, I know
plenty of boys.

31:48.206 --> 31:49.832
You do? Who?

31:49.916 --> 31:51.166
Where do you meet them?

31:51.249 --> 31:52.918
You meet them
in those chat rooms?

31:53.001 --> 31:55.837
How do you know you're not talking
to some middle-aged freak?

31:55.921 --> 31:58.507
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged
freak a mile away.

31:58.590 --> 32:01.176
It's beautiful today.
Let's go outside and eat.

32:01.218 --> 32:03.804
And Lainey,
leave the computer, please.

32:03.887 --> 32:05.430
Okay.

32:12.729 --> 32:14.731
Dad, it might be better
to eat inside.

32:14.815 --> 32:16.483
Stay here.

32:20.694 --> 32:22.154
What is this?

32:24.532 --> 32:27.409
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?

32:27.451 --> 32:30.663
- You're trespassing.
- You can't hide her forever!

32:30.746 --> 32:34.375
Simone appears only
when I want her to appear!

32:34.417 --> 32:35.708
Sounds like a prisoner.

32:35.792 --> 32:38.169
- What are you, holding her hostage?
- You're the hostage.

32:38.211 --> 32:40.256
I mean, you look kind
of captive to me.

32:47.887 --> 32:49.848
Lainey,
don't you ever wonder

32:49.889 --> 32:51.766
where I'm really
hiding Simone?

32:51.808 --> 32:54.519
Just as long as I know
where you are, Dad.

32:57.397 --> 32:59.357
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.

32:59.399 --> 33:01.276
Hello, Viktor.

33:01.359 --> 33:03.569
Sorry I got her back late.

33:03.652 --> 33:05.613
Oh, no problem.

33:05.655 --> 33:07.407
Hey, you want
to come in?

33:15.038 --> 33:16.623
- Hi.
- Hi, Honey.

33:16.707 --> 33:18.877
- Hi, Vik.
- Kent.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.297
Viktor, we simply
have to discuss

33:23.338 --> 33:25.299
"Eternity Forever."

33:25.340 --> 33:28.302
I still haven't received
Simone's script notes.

33:28.343 --> 33:30.636
There aren't any.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.514
If the filmmakers
are happy,

33:32.598 --> 33:34.475
she's happy.

33:34.558 --> 33:38.394
She considers herself,
you know, an instrument.

33:38.436 --> 33:40.772
So she's really going
to do all this nudity?

33:40.813 --> 33:42.690
It's on the page.

33:42.774 --> 33:44.610
We have to do something
about this budget.

33:44.651 --> 33:46.069
It's completely
unrealistic.

33:46.153 --> 33:48.446
You allowed nothing
for limousine service.

33:48.529 --> 33:51.032
- She drives herself.
- Uh-huh.

33:51.115 --> 33:53.910
- Hair and make-up?
- Does her own.

33:53.993 --> 33:56.995
- Theater training.
- Oh, she was in the theater?

33:57.037 --> 33:57.997
Where?

33:58.039 --> 33:59.707
You want her resume?
I'll send it to you.

33:59.749 --> 34:01.626
Okay, great. Thanks.

34:01.709 --> 34:04.087
At least, Viktor,
contingency for wardrobe.

34:04.170 --> 34:06.004
Anybody can go up a size.

34:06.088 --> 34:07.881
I guarantee she will not
gain an ounce.

34:07.964 --> 34:09.674
She is so disciplined.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.969
Well, we've gotta do
something about this--

34:12.011 --> 34:14.387
- "Stuntwoman."
- What about it?

34:14.429 --> 34:17.224
- Well, there isn't one.
- She doesn't need one.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.976
- Does all her own stunts.
- Even the fall from the plane?

34:20.060 --> 34:22.103
- Even the fall from the plane.
- Oh.

34:22.187 --> 34:23.980
Shoot it
on the last day.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.149
Listen, Viktor.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.235
I want to talk to you now,
not as Elaine, Studio Head,

34:29.319 --> 34:33.614
but as Elaine, ex-wife.
Hey, second ex-wife.

34:35.866 --> 34:38.286
Seriously.
You got lucky this last time.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.913
But you need
to be careful.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.581
We both know you wouldn't be
making this overblown art film

34:43.666 --> 34:46.377
if you hadn't convinced
Simone to be in it.

34:47.545 --> 34:48.963
Elaine...

34:50.255 --> 34:52.632
talking to you now,
not as Viktor, Director,

34:52.716 --> 34:56.094
but as Viktor,
your first former husband,

34:57.346 --> 34:59.556
what happened to you? Huh?

35:01.141 --> 35:03.226
Experience, Viktor.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.229
That's what happened
to me.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.063
Yeah, I've seen this
a hundred times.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.816
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.485
These young stars
destroying

35:12.569 --> 35:14.446
the very people
who discovered them.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.698
I'm worried about you,
that's all.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.367
This woman,
she controls your destiny.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.827
She doesn't control
my destiny.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.079
There's something
about her I don't trust.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.088
Hi, Jane.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.131
Thanks for taking me back,
Mr. Taransky.

35:34.214 --> 35:36.759
I know that it looked like
I sided with the studio,

35:36.842 --> 35:38.761
but I've always believed
in you. Honestly.

35:38.844 --> 35:40.429
Don't worry.
I understand.

35:40.512 --> 35:42.431
- Are they--
- They're all here.

35:42.514 --> 35:44.600
Okay, thank you.
Hello.

35:44.683 --> 35:46.769
Viktor.

35:46.852 --> 35:48.771
I just want to say
I am delighted

35:48.854 --> 35:52.356
to have such
a wonderful cast

35:52.440 --> 35:55.109
assembled here
for "Eternity Forever."

35:55.193 --> 35:56.737
A reminder:

35:56.779 --> 35:59.448
as a condition for working
on this picture,

35:59.531 --> 36:01.949
you will not be rehearsing
with Simone.

36:02.033 --> 36:04.494
You will not be shooting
with Simone.

36:04.494 --> 36:07.872
Actually, you are forbidden
from contacting Simone

36:07.955 --> 36:10.374
at any time, for any reason,
whatsoever.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.794
- Works for me.
- How will you shoot our love scenes?

36:12.877 --> 36:15.088
- Body double.
- For her?

36:15.129 --> 36:17.131
For you.

36:17.173 --> 36:20.717
Anyway, Simone insisted
on speaking with you herself

36:20.759 --> 36:22.220
before filming started.

36:22.303 --> 36:24.764
I believe she's on the line now.
Simone, are you there?

36:24.806 --> 36:26.891
I certainly am,
Mr. Taransky.

36:29.184 --> 36:31.103
So are we, Simone.

36:31.186 --> 36:34.606
Why don't you leave me alone
with my co-stars, Mr. Taransky,

36:34.648 --> 36:36.733
so we can get to know
each other better?

36:36.817 --> 36:38.610
Absolutely.
I'll be back in a minute.

36:38.652 --> 36:40.278
Hi, who's there?

36:40.362 --> 36:42.906
Don't be shy.
Introduce yourselves.

36:48.995 --> 36:50.580
I'm Mac.

36:50.664 --> 36:52.707
I turned down
a Bertolucci film to be here.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.585
Hi, Simone.
I'm Corel.

36:56.669 --> 36:58.587
Hi, I'm Claris.

36:58.671 --> 37:00.881
You used to date
my cousin, Dell.

37:00.965 --> 37:02.551
I'm Hewlitt.

37:02.634 --> 37:04.718
We can rehearse in private
if you like.

37:04.802 --> 37:08.013
My name is Lotus.

37:08.055 --> 37:10.182
God, I can't believe
I'm talking to you.

37:10.266 --> 37:12.684
We are going to become
such great friends.

37:12.767 --> 37:14.561
Hi, Simone, it's Hal.

37:14.602 --> 37:17.064
It's great to be working
together... again.

37:17.106 --> 37:18.858
Is that everyone?

37:18.941 --> 37:22.527
Well, obviously,
as you know, I'm Simone.

37:23.778 --> 37:25.196
Who else?

37:25.280 --> 37:27.282
I just want to start

37:27.365 --> 37:29.910
by apologizing
for my process.

37:29.994 --> 37:32.036
I know it's an unusual way
to work,

37:32.120 --> 37:34.539
but I just find
I relate better to people

37:34.581 --> 37:36.249
when they're not
actually there.

37:36.332 --> 37:38.251
Oh, of course.
Of course.

37:38.334 --> 37:40.210
I don't have much to say,

37:40.294 --> 37:43.673
Except, that I know
it's gonna be a great project

37:43.757 --> 37:48.594
if we all just trust
Mr. Taransky's vision.

37:48.635 --> 37:51.889
Always do
what Mr. Taransky says.

37:51.972 --> 37:55.935
If in doubt,
do it the Taransky way.

37:56.019 --> 37:58.937
I know we're gonna make
a wonderful movie together.

38:00.022 --> 38:01.482
Together.

38:01.523 --> 38:03.275
Absolutely.

38:26.923 --> 38:28.341
Veronica.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.722
What you don't understand,
Clyde, is that love--

38:34.764 --> 38:36.099
Still too big.

38:36.182 --> 38:38.059
I like it,
but it's too big.

38:39.268 --> 38:41.354
All right.
Smaller teardrops this time.

38:49.112 --> 38:52.155
What you don't understand,
Clyde,

38:52.239 --> 38:56.034
is that love
is like a wildflower.

38:56.076 --> 38:59.246
But that flower only grows

38:59.329 --> 39:01.164
on the edge...

39:01.248 --> 39:04.793
of a very high cliff.

39:05.919 --> 39:07.462
Perfect.

39:07.504 --> 39:08.462
Perfect.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.842
Simone. Simone.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.512
Simone.

39:18.389 --> 39:21.016
Gonna be a little change
in plans, Simone.

39:23.686 --> 39:26.355
You have no idea
the effect

39:26.439 --> 39:28.441
your performance
is having on people.

39:28.524 --> 39:30.651
We can't stop now.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.404
These films,
they're speaking

39:33.487 --> 39:35.363
to the human condition.

39:37.615 --> 39:39.117
We're changing lives.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.914
People need to believe
you're real.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.460
To reveal the truth now,

39:48.543 --> 39:50.462
it would be too cruel.

39:53.590 --> 39:56.384
You're gonna get in
a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.

39:56.426 --> 39:58.553
Now, why do you have
to bring that up?!

40:00.263 --> 40:02.723
I mean,
everything's a risk.

40:02.806 --> 40:05.100
But it's worth it,
isn't it?

40:10.482 --> 40:12.066
We've done
enough work today.

40:14.109 --> 40:16.570
You've been cooped up
in there too long.

40:17.613 --> 40:19.074
So how about...

40:19.157 --> 40:21.742
you and I going
out on the town?

40:23.911 --> 40:26.246
Tonight, they're going
to see you

40:26.330 --> 40:28.207
with their own eyes.

40:38.466 --> 40:40.384
Excuse me.

40:40.468 --> 40:43.888
I will be checking in
a very special guest.

40:43.971 --> 40:47.433
- A Ms. Enomis.
- Ah, Ms. Enomis.

40:48.684 --> 40:52.271
Now, Ms. Enomis
demands her privacy.

40:52.355 --> 40:55.608
So, you will switch off
all surveillance cameras.

40:55.690 --> 40:58.778
I alone, will escort
Ms. Enomis to her room

40:58.861 --> 41:00.738
via the rear exit.

41:00.780 --> 41:02.865
She must not be disturbed
at any time,

41:02.949 --> 41:04.575
for any reason whatsoever.

41:04.616 --> 41:07.202
I'm sure I can rely
on your discretion.

41:08.412 --> 41:09.955
Understood, sir.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.543
Thank you.

42:20.106 --> 42:22.067
There she is!

42:35.120 --> 42:36.705
Who is it?

42:36.747 --> 42:38.749
It's Simone.

42:50.344 --> 42:52.470
Okay, I think
everybody's here.

42:52.553 --> 42:54.263
Now!

43:05.066 --> 43:06.859
I think we're
all right now.

43:10.196 --> 43:11.989
Oh, thank God
for you, Faith.

43:12.073 --> 43:13.908
Thank God for you.

43:13.950 --> 43:17.703
This is way above
and beyond

43:17.787 --> 43:19.955
the call of duty
for a stand-in.

43:19.996 --> 43:22.624
I must tell you,
you have no idea

43:22.708 --> 43:25.002
the service you've
performed for Simone,

43:25.086 --> 43:27.338
shielding her
from these animals.

43:27.380 --> 43:29.506
Oh, no, Mr. Taransky.
Thank God for you.

43:29.589 --> 43:30.841
- For me?
- Yeah.

43:30.924 --> 43:32.342
How many directors
would go

43:32.426 --> 43:34.344
to so much trouble
to protect an actress?

43:34.428 --> 43:35.930
It's incredible.

43:39.099 --> 43:40.559
You know,
we're gonna have

43:40.642 --> 43:42.102
to go back
to my place,

43:42.144 --> 43:45.188
just to, you know,
keep them off the scent.

43:46.439 --> 43:48.023
Of course.

43:53.113 --> 43:54.613
You look so...

43:54.655 --> 43:58.409
So much like...
um, like her?

44:00.035 --> 44:02.037
Oh, yes, of course.
Like her.

44:02.122 --> 44:04.331
But you're
so very beautiful

44:04.415 --> 44:06.292
in your own right.

44:12.298 --> 44:16.343
I do find myself strangely
attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.

44:19.055 --> 44:20.848
Call me Viktor.

44:22.057 --> 44:23.475
Viktor.

44:23.558 --> 44:25.518
- Oh.
- Oh, Viktor.

44:30.607 --> 44:32.150
- Viktor.
- Yes?

44:32.233 --> 44:34.277
- This is so exciting.
- Yes.

44:35.487 --> 44:37.572
Do what you do
to Simone?

44:37.655 --> 44:39.740
What?
What did you say?

44:39.823 --> 44:42.118
I said do whatever
you do to Simone.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.747
What I do to Simone?

44:45.830 --> 44:47.624
Call me Simone!

44:47.707 --> 44:49.249
Simone?

44:49.333 --> 44:51.418
Yes. Say it again,
please.

44:51.502 --> 44:54.088
I want to know what it's like
to be her just for one night.

44:54.129 --> 44:55.965
Please, call me Simone.

44:56.049 --> 44:59.676
You're with me so you can
be close to her?

44:59.760 --> 45:01.345
Is that a problem?

45:03.222 --> 45:05.641
Okay. Excuse me
just a minute.

45:05.682 --> 45:07.475
Is something wrong?

45:07.558 --> 45:09.728
Well, actually,

45:09.812 --> 45:12.314
maybe we can do this
some other time

45:12.398 --> 45:14.441
- or something.
- Are you busy tomorrow?

45:15.858 --> 45:18.986
Gentlemen,
the Presidential Suite.

45:35.503 --> 45:37.422
Ahem--

45:41.634 --> 45:43.760
I think that should
take care of everything.

45:43.844 --> 45:45.345
Yes, sir.

45:45.429 --> 45:47.765
I believe it will.

45:47.849 --> 45:50.017
Leave me for a moment.

46:07.367 --> 46:09.118
Simone.

47:25.359 --> 47:27.111
- Brilliant.
- Elaine!

47:27.194 --> 47:29.654
- There she is.
- The picture--

47:29.695 --> 47:31.447
The picture.
It's a revelation.

47:31.531 --> 47:33.283
Thank you.
Thank you.

47:33.367 --> 47:35.077
We all worked
so hard.

47:35.160 --> 47:38.454
- It was you.
- No, it was all of us.

47:38.496 --> 47:40.039
It was incredible.

47:40.123 --> 47:41.582
Thank you all.

47:56.722 --> 47:58.348
Thank you.

47:59.434 --> 48:00.601
- Whoa!
- Viktor!

48:00.643 --> 48:02.437
- Is she here?
- Viktor, is she here?

48:04.689 --> 48:06.440
Oh, I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?

48:06.481 --> 48:07.899
Somebody
said she was here.

48:07.983 --> 48:09.943
Jesus.
That's her glass.

48:11.528 --> 48:14.448
Jack Daniels,
straight up.

48:14.489 --> 48:17.576
- My kind of woman.
- Come on, where is she?

48:17.659 --> 48:19.453
I don't know.
She's, uh...

48:19.536 --> 48:21.288
Is that her
by the fountain?

48:22.788 --> 48:24.415
You know,
between you and me,

48:24.498 --> 48:26.543
- she doesn't really exist.
- Simone!

48:26.626 --> 48:29.087
- Simone!
- Simone's here?

48:29.171 --> 48:31.590
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- She's here?!

48:31.631 --> 48:33.591
- Simone!
- I got your glass!

48:33.632 --> 48:35.760
I'm your biggest fan!

48:40.474 --> 48:42.683
Simone!

48:42.767 --> 48:44.643
- Simone!
- Simone?

48:53.944 --> 48:55.488
Get out!

48:58.531 --> 49:00.200
Not you two.

49:07.457 --> 49:12.921
She goes to a major
Hollywood A-list party

49:13.004 --> 49:14.631
and we don't get
an interview,

49:14.672 --> 49:17.759
a comment?
We don't even get a photograph?!

49:17.842 --> 49:19.803
Is that what
you're telling me?

49:19.886 --> 49:21.471
Nobody got a photograph.

49:21.554 --> 49:23.223
Nobody ever gets a photograph.

49:23.306 --> 49:25.307
We have our best people
on it, Mr. Sayer.

49:25.391 --> 49:26.517
Get better people!

49:27.726 --> 49:30.104
What about the 24-hour
tail on Taransky?

49:30.187 --> 49:33.483
They're camped out every place
he goes; every concierge,

49:33.566 --> 49:35.359
every maitre d',
they're all on the take.

49:35.442 --> 49:37.361
But this Simone woman
is good.

49:37.403 --> 49:39.780
Obviously, that is not
her real name.

49:39.822 --> 49:41.573
She uses
an assumed identity.

49:41.657 --> 49:43.241
She travels under
a false name.

49:43.324 --> 49:45.244
She checks into
a hotel under an alias.

49:45.327 --> 49:48.247
Never stays in the same place
two nights in a row.

49:48.330 --> 49:50.791
What about the satellite photos?
What happened?

49:55.503 --> 49:58.298
- Nothin'.
- Nothing from space?!

50:00.008 --> 50:01.592
What about
the fingerprints?

50:01.676 --> 50:04.303
What happened when we dusted
that whole hotel suite?

50:04.387 --> 50:06.764
Well, we have some
of Taransky's fingerprints,

50:08.516 --> 50:10.393
a lot of yours...

50:10.476 --> 50:12.270
and none of hers.

50:12.353 --> 50:15.982
No one is that perfect,
that pure.

50:16.023 --> 50:18.443
You know, I had something
on Mother Teresa once.

50:18.526 --> 50:20.110
But then she died

50:20.193 --> 50:21.945
and it just wasn't
worth it anymore.

50:22.028 --> 50:25.867
I know how to flush out
this Simone woman.

50:27.368 --> 50:30.412
A tell-all story
from her childhood.

50:30.495 --> 50:32.372
You have one?

50:34.124 --> 50:37.335
I will when you're
finished writing it.

50:58.397 --> 51:00.274
Please don't
make me do this.

51:00.316 --> 51:02.443
Guard, open this door
right now.

51:02.485 --> 51:04.320
Mr. Taransky gave me
specific instructions

51:04.403 --> 51:05.696
never to open up this door.

51:05.738 --> 51:07.239
- What are you doing?!
- Mr. Taransky!

51:07.323 --> 51:09.450
- Why did you do this?!
- We have to talk to her!

51:09.533 --> 51:11.327
- We know she's in there.
- Okay.

51:11.410 --> 51:13.411
What is this about?

51:13.495 --> 51:15.163
We've got the tracking numbers
for "Eternity Forever."

51:15.246 --> 51:16.165
They're in the toilet.

51:16.248 --> 51:18.084
She's gotta get out there
and sell the film.

51:18.167 --> 51:20.252
What do you want her to do,
go door-to-door?

51:20.336 --> 51:23.254
Even Garbo would be on the talk show
circuit if she were alive!

51:23.338 --> 51:25.965
It is precisely because she
doesn't crave the limelight

51:26.049 --> 51:27.300
that people love her!

51:27.384 --> 51:29.178
- This is bullshit!
- She is about the work,

51:29.220 --> 51:32.013
- and only the work!
- This is overshadowing the work.

51:32.097 --> 51:33.807
If you can't handle her,
I will.

51:33.890 --> 51:36.101
It's not a good time.
She's emotional.

51:36.184 --> 51:38.103
Today, her mother dies.

51:38.186 --> 51:39.937
Scene 42
of "Good for Nothing."

51:40.020 --> 51:42.774
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.

51:42.857 --> 51:44.776
- Step aside!
- We're going in!

51:44.859 --> 51:48.154
- This is ridiculous!
- No! No!

51:48.196 --> 51:50.489
- What are you doing?!
- Simone!

51:53.409 --> 51:55.160
I trusted you.

51:58.038 --> 52:00.082
- Simone?
- You can come out, it's Elaine!

52:00.165 --> 52:02.418
- We just want to have a meeting.
- We can talk,

52:02.459 --> 52:04.586
- girl-to-girl. Just us.
- Where is she?

52:04.670 --> 52:06.421
- She's gone.
- Where are the sets?

52:06.462 --> 52:09.591
- God, that is so like her.
- Where are the cameras?

52:09.675 --> 52:12.177
Viktor, we're not paying
for this are we?

52:12.261 --> 52:13.637
What is all this?

52:16.097 --> 52:18.057
What is all this?

52:18.141 --> 52:20.059
Well...

52:20.143 --> 52:22.438
I suppose

52:22.521 --> 52:24.939
it was gonna come out
sooner or later.

52:24.981 --> 52:28.443
I guess I'm actually
relieved in a way.

52:28.484 --> 52:30.403
I can just say it finally.

52:32.196 --> 52:34.489
She's a computer--

52:34.573 --> 52:36.576
addict.

52:36.659 --> 52:38.161
What?

52:38.202 --> 52:40.538
She's a computer addict!

52:40.621 --> 52:42.914
She's buried in here.

52:42.998 --> 52:44.875
Day in, day out.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.005
Of course.
I should have guessed.

52:49.088 --> 52:52.299
It's why she never
goes anywhere,

52:52.340 --> 52:54.968
- Why she's never seen in public.
- Now you're getting it.

52:55.052 --> 52:57.220
Probably spends
her whole life in chat rooms.

52:57.304 --> 52:59.556
- The one place she can be herself.
- Anonymous.

52:59.598 --> 53:01.558
Only it's worse.
It's far worse.

53:03.602 --> 53:05.479
She's extremely
agoraphobic.

53:05.520 --> 53:08.565
She has a morbid fear
of people,

53:08.607 --> 53:11.317
of germs,

53:11.400 --> 53:13.861
places, heights--

53:13.944 --> 53:15.614
- Name it.
- This is terrible.

53:15.655 --> 53:17.407
How is she going
to plug the film?

53:17.491 --> 53:20.076
- Yes, indeed.
- She has to do publicity.

53:20.117 --> 53:22.578
Maybe I could get her
to do something.

53:22.661 --> 53:24.872
Maybe a television
talk show or something.

53:24.914 --> 53:25.956
Yes!

53:26.040 --> 53:28.667
- Taped.
- Make it live, please.

53:28.751 --> 53:30.086
- Live?
- Please.

53:30.169 --> 53:32.338
She'd never go there.
It would have to be remote.

53:32.421 --> 53:34.131
We can work with that.

53:34.215 --> 53:36.091
I can't promise anything.

53:36.174 --> 53:37.842
- We understand.
- Thank you, Viktor.

53:37.926 --> 53:40.178
- Thank you, Viktor.
- Don't grovel.

53:40.220 --> 53:42.014
Thank you.

53:42.098 --> 53:43.349
Give her our best.

53:43.432 --> 53:45.266
That agoraphobia--
it's like a plague.

53:45.350 --> 53:46.851
It's out of control
in Europe.

53:48.937 --> 53:51.940
It's so good of you
to protect her like this.

53:53.942 --> 53:55.110
She wanted you--

53:55.151 --> 53:57.445
No, no.
Don't touch that.

53:57.529 --> 53:59.698
Germs.

53:59.739 --> 54:01.449
She wanted you
to have that.

54:01.533 --> 54:04.201
She was there.
She was right there.

54:04.284 --> 54:05.911
Yeah.

54:08.456 --> 54:09.874
Oh, my gosh.

54:12.793 --> 54:14.378
She didn't,
by any chance,

54:14.461 --> 54:16.130
happen
to mention me?

54:17.339 --> 54:19.216
Actually, she did.

54:19.258 --> 54:21.802
She, uh...

54:21.844 --> 54:25.848
she said that she thought
you were very beautiful.

54:25.931 --> 54:28.225
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:29.475 --> 54:31.102
Would you want to go

54:31.144 --> 54:33.605
and get something to eat,
or something?

54:35.649 --> 54:37.568
Viktor,
I'd love to, really.,

54:37.651 --> 54:40.570
but don't you have
to go talk to Simone?

54:42.947 --> 54:44.657
If I can find her.

54:49.328 --> 54:51.414
Well.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.750
All right. Good.

54:53.833 --> 54:55.918
- Thanks, Viktor.
- Thank you.

54:59.464 --> 55:00.882
I'm gonna-- Bye.

55:21.276 --> 55:24.570
Tonight,
on Frank Brand Live--

55:24.653 --> 55:26.865
Since taking the nation
by storm

55:26.948 --> 55:30.994
in her debut movie,
"Sunrise, Sunset,"

55:31.078 --> 55:35.247
no one has managed to land
a live television interview

55:35.289 --> 55:39.086
with this fabulous
shooting starlet, Simone--

55:39.127 --> 55:41.087
until now.

55:41.128 --> 55:44.382
she's agreed to talk
with us tonight

55:44.465 --> 55:46.258
from the set
of her new film.

55:46.342 --> 55:48.469
Welcome, Simone.

55:50.637 --> 55:54.683
So glad you can find time
in your hectic schedule to be here.

55:54.767 --> 55:56.811
It's my pleasure.

55:56.894 --> 55:58.812
Wonderful to be
with you, Frank.

55:58.895 --> 56:04.150
No one can accuse you
of being overexposed, Simone.

56:04.234 --> 56:07.196
Why have you stayed so completely
out of the limelight?

56:07.279 --> 56:09.531
I guess I just think actors
talk too much.

56:09.614 --> 56:12.534
Does the world really want
to hear my life story

56:12.617 --> 56:15.078
just because I have a movie
opening on Friday?

56:15.120 --> 56:17.496
Wow.

56:17.579 --> 56:19.833
She is all woman.

56:19.916 --> 56:21.126
Of course, the problem

56:21.209 --> 56:23.545
with shying away
from publicity these days

56:23.628 --> 56:25.963
is that it tends
to attract even more.

56:26.004 --> 56:28.382
Don't I know it.

56:28.424 --> 56:30.342
But the only reason
I'm here now,

56:30.426 --> 56:33.138
is to put the attention
back where it belongs,

56:33.221 --> 56:35.514
on Mr. Taransky's film.

56:35.597 --> 56:37.975
And you don't secretly want
the attention?

56:38.058 --> 56:39.893
I'm not even sure
I deserve it.

56:39.977 --> 56:41.854
You see, after tonight,

56:41.895 --> 56:44.230
I'll have just as much
screen time on your show

56:44.314 --> 56:46.025
as I have in my movies.

56:46.108 --> 56:48.777
Now, how is that healthy
for a performer?

56:48.861 --> 56:52.114
Because you have to understand,
Frank, none of this is real.

56:52.156 --> 56:55.158
Who I am on screen
and who I really am,

56:55.241 --> 56:57.494
they're two totally
different people.

56:57.578 --> 56:59.455
Change of topic.

56:59.538 --> 57:01.456
You have been
romantically linked

57:01.539 --> 57:03.833
to dozens of men
in the press--

57:03.916 --> 57:07.170
Mick Jagger, Steven Hawking,
Fidel Castro,

57:07.211 --> 57:09.338
most recently,
Viktor Taransky.

57:09.422 --> 57:11.382
Is there a Mr. Right
in there somewhere?

57:11.466 --> 57:15.511
You know, Frank, I'd rather not
discuss my private life.

57:15.595 --> 57:17.180
But Viktor and I,

57:17.263 --> 57:19.181
we are inseparable.

57:19.264 --> 57:21.016
Oh, Viktor.

57:21.099 --> 57:22.851
You dog.

57:24.354 --> 57:26.105
I wouldn't be here today
without him.

57:36.782 --> 57:38.992
Would you like
a moment, Simone?

57:39.076 --> 57:41.119
No, I'm okay.

57:44.581 --> 57:46.415
Okay.

57:46.457 --> 57:48.459
Then let's talk about
this work

57:48.501 --> 57:50.003
you care so much about.

57:50.087 --> 57:51.463
Sure.

57:51.505 --> 57:53.548
Where would you like
to start, Frank?

57:53.590 --> 57:56.175
- How about the nudity?
- I know where that is.

57:56.258 --> 57:58.469
Nudity's just never been
an issue for me.

57:58.511 --> 58:00.471
I know that tree.

58:00.513 --> 58:03.225
- Clothes are simply an option.
- I know that tree.

58:03.266 --> 58:04.517
I know where that is.

58:04.558 --> 58:06.560
What exactly was it
that attracted you

58:06.602 --> 58:08.145
to your first two projects?

58:08.187 --> 58:11.148
I suppose what I like most
about the movies I'm in

58:11.190 --> 58:13.733
is that they're not about
special effects.

58:13.817 --> 58:16.821
And they are better
for it, I might add.

58:26.871 --> 58:30.000
We appear to be having
some satellite difficulties.

58:30.084 --> 58:33.169
But, before we lose you
completely, Simone,

58:33.253 --> 58:35.672
I just want to say
thank you.

58:35.714 --> 58:37.257
Thank you, Frank.

58:37.340 --> 58:39.800
Goodbye.

58:39.883 --> 58:43.096
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simone.

59:14.209 --> 59:15.793
I've been here before.

59:15.877 --> 59:17.795
On my honeymoon
with my ex-wife.

59:19.047 --> 59:20.465
Yeah, look.

59:20.548 --> 59:22.926
It's the exact
same tree.

59:23.010 --> 59:24.969
And look
in the distance.

59:27.555 --> 59:28.723
The mountain.

59:31.851 --> 59:33.810
It's a hotel.

59:35.772 --> 59:38.316
I don't understand.

59:38.399 --> 59:40.985
Could they have built
that hotel since yesterday?

59:43.236 --> 59:44.821
Get in the car.

01:00:04.341 --> 01:00:06.218
Simone! Simone!

01:00:14.183 --> 01:00:16.645
We don't do the photos,
you don't get the cover.

01:00:16.728 --> 01:00:18.104
It's as simple as that.

01:00:18.145 --> 01:00:21.023
Yes. Written answers
to written questions.

01:00:21.107 --> 01:00:23.442
Didn't we have
this conversation before?

01:00:24.944 --> 01:00:27.487
Yeah, web site interviews,
no problem.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.241
I think people are gonna
love "Eternity Forever."

01:00:30.324 --> 01:00:33.577
"Eternity Forever"
is my finest work.

01:00:33.661 --> 01:00:35.371
I loved working
with the director

01:00:35.454 --> 01:00:37.664
of "Eternity Forever."
He's a genius.

01:00:37.747 --> 01:00:38.998
You wish.

01:00:42.878 --> 01:00:44.921
It's wonderful being
a movie star.

01:00:47.465 --> 01:00:50.135
But there's so many other ways
I want to express myself.

01:00:56.766 --> 01:00:58.893
But it's not enough
to be a movie star.

01:00:58.977 --> 01:01:00.854
You have to be
a pop star, too.

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:04.940
If you really want
to make a difference.

01:01:30.757 --> 01:01:32.842
Nice boat, Taransky!

01:01:32.925 --> 01:01:34.678
It's not a boat,

01:01:34.762 --> 01:01:36.430
it's a yacht.

01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:39.932
I know
what you're up to.

01:01:40.016 --> 01:01:42.477
You know, I really
don't have time for this.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.355
I think you do,
'cause I know it's a fake.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.316
It's bogus.

01:01:48.399 --> 01:01:51.152
You used an old library shot
for the background.

01:01:52.779 --> 01:01:54.530
She never
was in New Mexico.

01:01:54.614 --> 01:01:56.573
She never even left
the studio.

01:01:56.656 --> 01:01:58.575
I've done my homework.

01:01:58.658 --> 01:02:01.120
- I've studied her.
- I bet you have.

01:02:01.204 --> 01:02:04.499
I've looked at every piece
of publicity she's done.

01:02:04.582 --> 01:02:06.249
And as far as I can tell,

01:02:06.333 --> 01:02:07.918
there's no evidence

01:02:07.959 --> 01:02:10.170
that she has ever left
the studio.

01:02:10.253 --> 01:02:11.880
Oh...

01:02:11.963 --> 01:02:14.257
And for some reason,

01:02:14.341 --> 01:02:16.176
this woman leaves
no paper trail?

01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:19.012
Now, I've obtained a copy
of your bank account.

01:02:19.096 --> 01:02:21.306
I know you have
power of attorney,

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.641
but so far,
you have not turned over

01:02:23.724 --> 01:02:26.144
a single solitary cent
to this woman.

01:02:26.228 --> 01:02:27.854
I keep it in a trust.

01:02:27.896 --> 01:02:30.148
I know that's what you want
people to believe,

01:02:30.232 --> 01:02:31.692
but I gotta tell you,

01:02:31.733 --> 01:02:33.984
embezzlement
is a serious matter.

01:02:34.068 --> 01:02:36.445
Not to mention abduction.

01:02:36.529 --> 01:02:38.280
- Abduction?
- Yeah.

01:02:38.364 --> 01:02:40.158
Off the record.

01:02:40.242 --> 01:02:41.992
I want to know
how you're doing it.

01:02:42.076 --> 01:02:44.412
Is it drugs?
Is it mind control?

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:46.747
Is it blackmail?
Is it all three?

01:02:48.249 --> 01:02:51.126
What do you do? Do you keep her
locked in a box somewhere?

01:02:51.209 --> 01:02:53.796
What is it exactly

01:02:53.879 --> 01:02:55.756
that you want?

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.384
I want to see her.

01:02:58.467 --> 01:03:02.012
Unless you show me
Simone live and in person,

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:04.848
I show these photos
to the authorities.

01:03:07.601 --> 01:03:09.769
You want to see her?

01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:11.438
All right.

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.106
You've got a deal.

01:03:14.649 --> 01:03:17.192
You want to see her?
You're gonna see her!

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:20.321
Good!

01:03:26.326 --> 01:03:28.287
Mr. Taransky.

01:03:28.328 --> 01:03:31.331
- Hello, gentlemen.
- We're all ready.

01:03:31.415 --> 01:03:32.584
This time tomorrow night,

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:35.544
she'll be standing right here
in front of 100,000 people.

01:03:35.586 --> 01:03:38.297
We could've sold
this out 20 times.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.215
Yeah, the sound check
went great.

01:03:40.299 --> 01:03:42.176
The laser show
is good to go.

01:03:42.217 --> 01:03:43.634
I gotta ask you,
though,

01:03:43.718 --> 01:03:46.305
you ordered
an awful lot of smoke.

01:03:46.388 --> 01:03:48.599
Well, that's the way
she wants it.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.809
After you told us
about the death threats,

01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:53.144
security guards
are under strict instructions

01:03:53.227 --> 01:03:54.812
never to take their eyes
off the crowd.

01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:57.815
Excellent. Here, Simone wanted
you to have these.

01:03:57.899 --> 01:03:59.401
- Unreal.
- And remember--

01:03:59.485 --> 01:04:01.362
no cameras,
no binoculars.

01:04:03.237 --> 01:04:06.032
Ladies and gentlemen,
Viktor Taransky Promotions

01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:10.078
is proud to present Simone--
live on stage

01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:13.539
for the debut concert
of the Splendid Isolation tour.

01:04:16.834 --> 01:04:18.628
Let's get you into hair
and make-up.

01:04:42.192 --> 01:04:43.610
No.

01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:54.121
No.

01:05:03.964 --> 01:05:05.297
Yes.

01:05:05.381 --> 01:05:07.091
You know, it's easier

01:05:07.174 --> 01:05:09.927
to make 100,000 believe
than just one?

01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:18.561
And now, the one,

01:05:18.644 --> 01:05:21.731
the only, Simone!

01:05:25.025 --> 01:05:26.317
I love you...

01:05:30.031 --> 01:05:31.281
LA.

01:05:31.364 --> 01:05:33.616
It's great to be here.

01:05:37.996 --> 01:05:39.789
# Looking out #

01:05:39.831 --> 01:05:42.750
# On the morning rain #

01:05:44.002 --> 01:05:47.756
# I used
to feel so inspired #

01:05:50.507 --> 01:05:54.303
# And when I knew I had
to face another day #

01:05:57.015 --> 01:05:59.975
# Lord, it made me feel
so tired #

01:06:02.644 --> 01:06:06.106
# Before the day I met you #

01:06:06.148 --> 01:06:08.649
# Life was so unkind #

01:06:08.691 --> 01:06:13.280
# But you're the key
to my peace of mind #

01:06:13.364 --> 01:06:16.366
# 'Cause you make me feel #

01:06:16.449 --> 01:06:19.744
# You make me feel #

01:06:19.786 --> 01:06:26.084
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:31.089
# Oh, baby #

01:06:31.172 --> 01:06:32.924
# What you've done to me #

01:06:33.007 --> 01:06:35.008
# Done to me #

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:39.097
# You make me feel
so good inside #

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.141
# Good inside #

01:06:42.225 --> 01:06:45.769
# And I just wanna be #

01:06:45.852 --> 01:06:48.063
# Wanna be #

01:06:48.146 --> 01:06:51.983
# Close to you,
you make me feel so alive #

01:06:52.025 --> 01:06:55.445
# 'Cause you make me feel #

01:06:55.529 --> 01:06:58.824
# You make me feel #

01:06:58.865 --> 01:07:05.163
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

01:07:05.205 --> 01:07:07.207
# You make me feel #

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.418
- # You make me feel #
- # You make me feel #

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:13.337
# You make me feel #

01:07:13.421 --> 01:07:18.426
# You make me feel
like a real... #

01:07:20.177 --> 01:07:22.888
# You make me feel #

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:26.225
# Feel like a... #

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:31.689
# You make me feel
like a real... #

01:07:35.693 --> 01:07:37.861
Thank you.

01:07:37.944 --> 01:07:40.572
Never stop believing.

01:07:44.952 --> 01:07:47.704
Yeah! Simone!

01:07:50.415 --> 01:07:52.500
# What you've done to me #

01:07:54.084 --> 01:07:55.754
# Natural woman. #

01:08:01.426 --> 01:08:04.178
I said I didn't want
to be disturbed!

01:08:05.971 --> 01:08:08.058
Viktor.

01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:12.770
My two favorite girls
in all the world.

01:08:12.811 --> 01:08:14.313
We just stopped by
to congratulate Simone.

01:08:14.396 --> 01:08:15.856
Well, you know...

01:08:15.939 --> 01:08:18.067
she's lying down.
She's exhausted.

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:20.027
Yeah, I can imagine.

01:08:21.278 --> 01:08:23.279
Listen, thank Simone
for the tickets, okay?

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:25.491
That's a good color
on you.

01:08:26.867 --> 01:08:28.535
It was
a great show, Dad.

01:08:33.665 --> 01:08:35.584
I can't believe
she's doing this.

01:08:35.626 --> 01:08:37.336
Taking advantage
of him this way.

01:08:37.377 --> 01:08:38.877
- It's cruel.
- Why?

01:08:38.961 --> 01:08:41.421
Obviously, this can't last.
She's gonna dump him.

01:08:41.506 --> 01:08:44.175
Viktor won't be able to take that,
he's too sensitive.

01:08:44.216 --> 01:08:46.176
This'll destroy him.

01:08:46.219 --> 01:08:47.929
Elaine, do you realize

01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:50.055
that you can't stop
talking about Viktor?

01:08:50.139 --> 01:08:51.599
I have to talk to her.

01:08:55.687 --> 01:08:57.604
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:02.359
I'm starting to feel
like I don't exist.

01:09:13.955 --> 01:09:15.872
Dad?

01:09:15.956 --> 01:09:18.875
Oh, hi, baby.
Thank you.

01:09:26.424 --> 01:09:29.219
So how's your love life?

01:09:29.261 --> 01:09:31.220
I do okay.

01:09:31.263 --> 01:09:33.221
What about you?

01:09:33.264 --> 01:09:35.558
Well, you know me.
Married to my work.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.393
I noticed.

01:09:42.148 --> 01:09:44.692
You know I don't like
to get between you and mom,

01:09:44.774 --> 01:09:48.069
but she's feeling
down right now.

01:09:48.154 --> 01:09:49.779
She broke up with Kent.

01:09:55.328 --> 01:09:58.372
She thinks
you're with Simone.

01:09:58.456 --> 01:10:00.749
Ah, Lainey.
That's so ridiculous.

01:10:00.832 --> 01:10:02.500
I don't have
a relationship with Simone.

01:10:02.584 --> 01:10:05.545
I know, I know,
but Mom doesn't.

01:10:05.628 --> 01:10:07.590
Maybe if Simone spoke
to her she could

01:10:07.673 --> 01:10:10.759
straighten things out.
Dinner maybe.

01:10:10.842 --> 01:10:13.261
Dinner?

01:10:13.303 --> 01:10:15.096
I don't know
about dinner.

01:10:16.514 --> 01:10:18.432
That'd be difficult,
I think.

01:10:19.976 --> 01:10:22.604
- Maybe a phone call?
- It's too impersonal.

01:10:22.687 --> 01:10:24.439
They have to meet
face-to-face.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.777
Well, I'll think
of something.

01:10:31.362 --> 01:10:33.156
The escalating violence,

01:10:33.239 --> 01:10:35.949
tragic loss of human life,
and threat of all-out war

01:10:36.033 --> 01:10:38.369
was overshadowed today
by the announcement

01:10:38.452 --> 01:10:40.245
of the Oscar nominations.

01:10:42.498 --> 01:10:44.248
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:10:44.332 --> 01:10:47.169
- Is this Elaine?
- Who's this?

01:10:47.252 --> 01:10:50.214
- Oh my God. Is that you, Simone?
- Yes.

01:10:50.297 --> 01:10:52.924
- You look beautiful today.
- Thanks, I--

01:10:53.007 --> 01:10:55.635
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.762
Beside you.

01:11:00.057 --> 01:11:02.558
- Oh!
- I borrowed Viktor's car.

01:11:02.642 --> 01:11:05.228
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:11:05.311 --> 01:11:08.648
I'm really late.
I would love to talk to you,

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:11.066
But I'm on my way
to see Viktor right now.

01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:14.445
Simone, I know what's
going on between you two.

01:11:14.529 --> 01:11:16.781
Oh? No. Oh, Elaine,

01:11:16.864 --> 01:11:18.157
there's absolutely nothing.

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.325
It's strictly
a working relationship.

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.411
I just don't want
to see Viktor get hurt.

01:11:22.494 --> 01:11:25.164
Sounds to me like you still
have feelings for him.

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:28.126
Well, we have
a daughter together.

01:11:28.167 --> 01:11:31.336
I don't love Viktor.
I could never love anyone.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.340
I'm in love with the camera.

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:39.011
Simone, I recognize
the coat you're wearing.

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:41.263
I gave it to Viktor
on his birthday.

01:11:41.346 --> 01:11:42.681
Christ.

01:11:42.723 --> 01:11:44.599
Elaine, I just--

01:11:44.641 --> 01:11:46.143
Whoa.

01:11:49.103 --> 01:11:51.773
God! Oh my God!
I tell ya.

01:11:53.358 --> 01:11:58.487
- Are you all right?
- This does look awful. I know that.

01:11:58.571 --> 01:12:01.032
But, Viktor,
he's just so crazy about you.

01:12:01.115 --> 01:12:03.075
Could you go
to the Oscars with him?

01:12:03.159 --> 01:12:04.785
No, no, no.

01:12:04.869 --> 01:12:06.704
If you won't do it
for him,

01:12:06.787 --> 01:12:08.581
I ask you, please,
do it for me.

01:12:12.626 --> 01:12:14.169
Okay. Okay.
For you.

01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:16.087
For you I'll go.

01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:18.758
Thank you.
Well, here's my exit.

01:12:18.799 --> 01:12:20.593
All right.
I'm glad that we talked.

01:12:20.676 --> 01:12:21.719
- Oh, yes. Bye.
- Bye!

01:12:21.802 --> 01:12:23.261
Goodbye.

01:12:25.472 --> 01:12:28.224
Oh!

01:12:33.521 --> 01:12:35.690
And, the winner
of Best Actress...

01:12:35.732 --> 01:12:37.359
is...

01:12:39.027 --> 01:12:40.736
Oh, my goodness.
We have a tie.

01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:45.784
The winners are Simone
for "Sunrise, Sunset"...

01:12:47.077 --> 01:12:48.286
Thank you.

01:12:50.663 --> 01:12:54.458
...and Simone
for "Eternity Forever."

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:01.799
Unfortunately, Simone cannot
be with us here tonight

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:04.134
but thanks to the miracle
of modern technology,

01:13:04.218 --> 01:13:07.387
she joins us live from her
Goodwill Tour of the third world.

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.389
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simone!

01:13:13.977 --> 01:13:15.729
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

01:13:15.813 --> 01:13:18.189
This means
so much to me.

01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:21.067
I'm just sorry I couldn't
be there with you.

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:23.904
First, I want to acknowledge
my fellow nominees.

01:13:23.988 --> 01:13:26.948
I don't even feel I belong
in the Best Actress category,

01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:29.492
Iet alone with these
wonderful human beings.

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:32.704
And I also wanna thank
my co-stars

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:36.039
and the studio, of course.

01:13:36.123 --> 01:13:38.126
And as always,
I dedicate this to Hank,

01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:41.295
without whom none of this
would be possible.

01:13:41.379 --> 01:13:45.757
I love you, Hank,
wherever you are.

01:13:47.509 --> 01:13:50.471
Thank you.

01:13:55.851 --> 01:13:57.602
Who's Hank?
Her agent?

01:13:59.479 --> 01:14:02.023
- Her father.
- Oh.

01:14:03.191 --> 01:14:04.651
Why didn't
she thank you?

01:14:06.445 --> 01:14:08.196
She did.

01:14:10.448 --> 01:14:12.742
Didn't she?

01:14:12.825 --> 01:14:14.368
No.

01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:23.377
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,

01:14:23.461 --> 01:14:25.212
Viktor Taransky,

01:14:25.296 --> 01:14:27.714
without whom none
of this would be possible.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:31.886
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,

01:14:31.969 --> 01:14:33.554
Viktor Taransky,

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.890
without whom none
of this would be possible.

01:14:35.973 --> 01:14:37.557
Why didn't I say it?

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.394
How could I forget
to say it?

01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:45.149
I wrote it.

01:14:45.232 --> 01:14:48.568
And of course,
I must thank my collaborator,

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:50.153
Viktor Taransky,

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:53.323
without whom none
of this would be possible.

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.620
Excuse me, Mr. Taransky,

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.830
Are you ready
for your casting session?

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:03.624
Nicola is here for the role
of Simone's sister.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:06.835
Viktor.

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:12.883
So much has happened since
we last saw each other.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.219
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.221
- Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.894
I never got a chance
to properly apologize

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.646
for what happened
on "Sunrise."

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:28.607
Oh, that's okay.
I know. I understand.

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:32.902
When I saw what Simone
did with the role,

01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:36.573
I mean,
I fired all my people.

01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:38.200
I went into rehab.

01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:39.659
I took some acting classes.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.869
I changed my whole look.

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:45.289
She really,
really inspired me.

01:15:49.627 --> 01:15:51.254
Would you like me
to read?

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:54.716
Oh, sure.
That would be good.

01:16:17.279 --> 01:16:20.657
Who do you think
you are, Carlos,

01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:22.826
coming in here
like this?

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:27.497
My husband's sleeping
in the next room.

01:16:27.581 --> 01:16:30.208
You think
I won't call out?

01:16:30.292 --> 01:16:32.210
Do you think
I'll just...

01:16:32.294 --> 01:16:34.045
give in to you
without a fight,

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.881
Iike I did the last time
and the time before that?

01:16:45.806 --> 01:16:47.558
I wish you were dead.

01:16:59.944 --> 01:17:02.322
I wish we were both dead.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.539
Oh...

01:17:11.623 --> 01:17:14.834
that was just wonderful.

01:17:14.918 --> 01:17:16.628
Wonderful acting.

01:17:16.711 --> 01:17:18.837
Thank you.

01:17:18.921 --> 01:17:20.674
You could play the lead.

01:17:23.259 --> 01:17:25.053
Isn't that Simone's part?

01:17:27.262 --> 01:17:28.847
Of course.

01:17:28.931 --> 01:17:30.766
Of course it is.

01:17:31.892 --> 01:17:36.063
You have such
a beautiful line,

01:17:36.146 --> 01:17:38.357
right, right there.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.359
It's not a wrinkle,
or anything,

01:17:40.442 --> 01:17:42.069
it's like a dimple.

01:17:42.152 --> 01:17:44.195
Right--
when you smile it--

01:17:44.278 --> 01:17:45.864
I was thinking
of incorporating

01:17:45.948 --> 01:17:47.908
something like that
in Simone.

01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:52.871
Cosmetically altering
Simone to look like me?

01:17:54.956 --> 01:17:56.499
Oh, yeah.
That would be crazy.

01:17:56.582 --> 01:17:59.378
That would be crazy.
Yes...

01:17:59.461 --> 01:18:01.046
that would be nuts.

01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:07.302
Would you like me to try something
different with this, or do it again?

01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:10.305
No, it's fine.

01:18:11.555 --> 01:18:13.349
Okay.

01:18:15.059 --> 01:18:16.686
Thank you.

01:18:21.606 --> 01:18:23.400
Thank you, Viktor.

01:18:35.746 --> 01:18:37.706
Happy birthday, Lainey.

01:18:44.421 --> 01:18:45.881
What do you think?

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:49.383
It's fantastic.

01:18:50.801 --> 01:18:54.723
It's what she drove
in "Eternity Forever."

01:18:54.806 --> 01:18:56.724
- I know.
- See?

01:18:58.643 --> 01:19:01.145
- You have to thank her for me.
- It's from both of us.

01:19:01.228 --> 01:19:03.648
You know,
you won't be able

01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:05.483
to drive it till you get
your permit,

01:19:05.524 --> 01:19:07.985
but you can take it around
the lot, okay?

01:19:08.069 --> 01:19:09.612
Here.

01:19:12.365 --> 01:19:14.658
What's the matter?

01:19:14.741 --> 01:19:16.826
I can't accept it.

01:19:18.537 --> 01:19:21.332
Why?
Why, honey?

01:19:21.374 --> 01:19:23.333
I don't want a car, Dad.

01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:25.126
What do you want?

01:19:26.378 --> 01:19:28.797
I'll give you
whatever you want.

01:19:30.757 --> 01:19:32.842
The old Viktor Taransky.

01:19:36.596 --> 01:19:38.807
I can't stand
to see you like this,

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:42.017
clinging to Simone's
coattails.

01:19:44.103 --> 01:19:45.647
It used to be
all about the work

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.357
and now it's all about her.

01:19:48.733 --> 01:19:51.694
And then she's not even grateful
enough to thank you.

01:19:51.735 --> 01:19:53.195
Oh, no, that was me.

01:19:53.278 --> 01:19:55.698
There you go again,
blaming yourself.

01:19:57.116 --> 01:19:58.993
Can't you see
what she's done to you?

01:20:00.786 --> 01:20:04.623
She's taken advantage.
Mocking you.

01:20:04.707 --> 01:20:06.709
You deserve better
than Simone.

01:20:10.044 --> 01:20:12.840
- I have to go, Dad.
- Okay.

01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:44.578
Oh, sure.
She comes in all the time.

01:20:44.619 --> 01:20:46.204
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:46.288 --> 01:20:48.415
- Is she nice?
- We've become very close.

01:20:48.498 --> 01:20:51.502
She told me she wanted to look
at my script next week.

01:20:51.586 --> 01:20:53.045
- Jane?
- Gotta go.

01:20:54.546 --> 01:20:56.423
I'm leaving early.

01:20:56.506 --> 01:20:58.925
If anybody needs me,
I'll be at the beach house

01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:01.052
having dinner
with a certain someone.

01:21:14.273 --> 01:21:16.234
Elaine Christian, please.

01:22:01.569 --> 01:22:03.654
Elaine.

01:22:03.737 --> 01:22:05.030
Hi.

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.367
Hi.

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:12.371
I was in the neighborhood.
I just thought I'd drop by.

01:22:12.413 --> 01:22:14.540
You don't use
the front door anymore?

01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:16.542
Uh... no.

01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:22.381
When is she coming over?

01:22:24.466 --> 01:22:26.385
- About now.
- Oh.

01:22:28.304 --> 01:22:30.388
Okay. I'll just stay
until she gets here.

01:22:32.307 --> 01:22:34.809
Well, she's...

01:22:34.892 --> 01:22:37.062
already here.

01:22:37.146 --> 01:22:39.064
What?

01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:42.817
Elaine...

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.361
Simone is not coming
over tonight

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.574
or any other night.

01:22:52.952 --> 01:22:56.372
- I want you back, Elaine.
- I want you back, too.

01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:00.250
Oh, Viktor!

01:23:00.292 --> 01:23:02.003
Wait! Viktor!

01:23:02.086 --> 01:23:04.172
This is crazy.
Who are we kidding?

01:23:04.255 --> 01:23:06.673
I can't compete
with Simone.

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:09.468
- Well...
- What woman can?

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.678
I'd rather have you
than Simone.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.679
- Believe me.
- Oh.

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.682
That's so sweet.

01:23:16.099 --> 01:23:17.851
No, but I can't
let you do that,

01:23:17.934 --> 01:23:20.020
make that kind
of sacrifice.

01:23:20.103 --> 01:23:21.855
- No. No.
- God, this is strange.

01:23:21.938 --> 01:23:24.023
You know, I have stabbed
people in the back

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.859
and clawed and slept
my way to where I am.

01:23:26.942 --> 01:23:29.196
- but--
- You have?

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:31.198
Well, it goes
with the territory.

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:34.200
For some reason,
I can't betray Simone.

01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:37.203
I can't.
There's a goodness to her, Viktor.

01:23:37.286 --> 01:23:39.830
- No, there's nothing to her.
- Oh, Viktor.

01:23:42.291 --> 01:23:44.085
You say that now,
but in the morning

01:23:44.168 --> 01:23:46.045
you would
go back to her.

01:23:46.128 --> 01:23:47.505
- No. No.
- You would, Viktor.

01:23:47.546 --> 01:23:49.924
She's gonna retire.
She'll never work again.

01:23:50.007 --> 01:23:52.884
Of course she will.
Her public will demand it.

01:23:52.968 --> 01:23:54.887
- Not if I don't let her.
- You?

01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:56.889
- Yeah.
- How can you stop her?

01:24:01.393 --> 01:24:04.521
I'm gonna tell you
a secret now, Elaine.

01:24:12.237 --> 01:24:15.699
Simone isn't
a real person.

01:24:20.035 --> 01:24:21.496
I invented her.

01:24:23.915 --> 01:24:26.001
Every actor
is an invention.

01:24:26.084 --> 01:24:27.793
- Elaine--
- Please.

01:24:27.876 --> 01:24:30.379
You're lucky she's loyal enough
to stay with you.

01:24:30.379 --> 01:24:32.423
Maybe she's staying
out of pity.

01:24:32.506 --> 01:24:35.176
Who knows? I mean,
she certainly doesn't need you.

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.177
Listen,
she's thin air.

01:24:37.219 --> 01:24:39.179
- She's pixels.
- What?

01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:43.183
Computer code molded by me

01:24:43.267 --> 01:24:45.685
from a mathematical equation

01:24:45.768 --> 01:24:49.481
I inherited from a madman.

01:24:49.523 --> 01:24:51.567
How much have you had
to drink?

01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:53.359
There's no Simone.

01:24:53.443 --> 01:24:55.737
- I'm Simone.
- You're Simone?!

01:24:57.113 --> 01:24:59.617
I've done the impossible.

01:25:01.702 --> 01:25:05.622
I have recreated

01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:08.166
the infinite nuances

01:25:08.249 --> 01:25:10.168
of a human being--

01:25:10.251 --> 01:25:12.461
a human soul.

01:25:12.544 --> 01:25:15.465
I have taken nothing,

01:25:15.548 --> 01:25:18.468
and made it something.

01:25:20.886 --> 01:25:24.139
I have breathed life
into a machine.

01:25:25.933 --> 01:25:28.019
- I made a miracle.
- Viktor, please stop.

01:25:28.102 --> 01:25:31.313
- Please.
- I swear, Elaine.

01:25:31.396 --> 01:25:33.982
As God is my judge,
I swear.

01:25:34.066 --> 01:25:36.777
I made Simone.
I made her.

01:25:38.069 --> 01:25:39.988
- You made Simone?
- Yes.

01:25:41.573 --> 01:25:43.909
Viktor...

01:25:43.992 --> 01:25:45.827
she made you.

01:26:02.885 --> 01:26:04.970
You bitch.

01:26:05.011 --> 01:26:06.931
I'll destroy you.

01:26:52.224 --> 01:26:54.935
Bravo!

01:26:59.189 --> 01:27:00.774
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:27:14.872 --> 01:27:16.331
Had a rough night?

01:27:19.542 --> 01:27:22.128
Let's see if they still
love you after this.

01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:30.470
You made me.

01:27:30.553 --> 01:27:32.347
I made you first.

01:27:34.348 --> 01:27:36.683
Well, we're back
on "Good Morning, Good Day,"

01:27:36.767 --> 01:27:39.646
and we are here once again
with the incomparable Simone.

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:42.148
Simone, before the break

01:27:42.231 --> 01:27:45.150
you were taking a rather
controversial position.

01:27:45.233 --> 01:27:47.653
I just think
all elementary schools

01:27:47.736 --> 01:27:50.197
should have a firing range.

01:27:50.238 --> 01:27:53.241
How else can the children learn
to defend themselves?

01:27:53.283 --> 01:27:55.410
If there is a hole
in the ozone layer,

01:27:55.494 --> 01:27:57.537
how come I can't see it?

01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:59.998
Immigration? God!

01:27:59.998 --> 01:28:01.832
Isn't it crowded enough?

01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:04.795
But God created
furry animals to be worn.

01:28:04.878 --> 01:28:06.755
Have you ever tasted
dolphin?

01:28:06.838 --> 01:28:09.675
Pan-fried with a little
garlic and fennel.

01:28:09.758 --> 01:28:12.927
Everybody always talks about
the negatives of cigarettes.

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:14.637
But look at the benefits.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.640
I mean, you don't eat
as much.

01:28:16.682 --> 01:28:19.100
And you've got something
to hold in your hand.

01:28:20.685 --> 01:28:23.145
We always knew Simone
wasn't like other celebrities.

01:28:23.187 --> 01:28:24.939
- Oh, no.
- She speaks her mind.

01:28:25.022 --> 01:28:26.565
She certainly does.

01:28:36.367 --> 01:28:38.285
It's plastic, Hank.

01:28:38.368 --> 01:28:40.996
I know that's the way
you'd want it.

01:28:43.916 --> 01:28:45.834
She killed you, Hank.

01:28:45.917 --> 01:28:47.669
Now she's killing me.

01:28:49.379 --> 01:28:51.131
She's a serial killer.

01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:55.968
But I don't know
how to stop her.

01:28:56.051 --> 01:29:00.098
I mean, she's taken on
a life of her own.

01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:04.268
I can't just come clean,

01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:06.270
you know,
make some confession,

01:29:06.353 --> 01:29:08.772
because...

01:29:08.856 --> 01:29:11.943
I've defrauded millions.
They'd turn on me.

01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:16.655
I just can't
put the genie

01:29:16.739 --> 01:29:18.699
back in the bottle,
because...

01:29:18.782 --> 01:29:20.784
if she suddenly
stopped working,

01:29:20.868 --> 01:29:22.620
you know, just dropped
out of sight,

01:29:22.703 --> 01:29:25.289
they'd never let it rest.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.793
I tried killing
her career,

01:29:33.546 --> 01:29:35.758
but they like her
even more.

01:29:40.219 --> 01:29:41.763
What am I gonna do?

01:29:52.899 --> 01:29:54.817
Not another word, Hank.

01:29:56.069 --> 01:29:58.487
You are truly a genius.

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.332
Thank you, Hank.

01:30:11.875 --> 01:30:13.460
Thank you.

01:30:18.715 --> 01:30:21.343
What's the matter,
Viktor?

01:30:22.427 --> 01:30:24.470
You look so sad.

01:30:26.555 --> 01:30:28.850
Don't you love me anymore?

01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:35.398
It's over, isn't it?

01:30:43.572 --> 01:30:44.532
I know what you're thinking,
Simone.

01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:49.870
This is
a phoney-baloney world.

01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:54.709
We're all living
one big lie.

01:30:54.792 --> 01:30:56.794
So, why shouldn't
you live, too?

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:02.299
You're more authentic than
all these people who worship you.

01:31:02.382 --> 01:31:04.592
And that's the problem.

01:31:09.889 --> 01:31:11.891
You're looking
at the real fraud.

01:31:13.226 --> 01:31:16.521
I told myself this was
all about the work.

01:31:16.605 --> 01:31:18.564
But if that were the truth,

01:31:18.647 --> 01:31:21.234
it wouldn't matter to me

01:31:21.318 --> 01:31:23.236
that you get
all the attention.

01:31:26.031 --> 01:31:27.865
And it does.

01:31:29.408 --> 01:31:31.327
It does.

01:31:33.579 --> 01:31:35.498
I'm sorry, Simone.

01:31:36.832 --> 01:31:39.501
Here I was trying
to convince

01:31:39.543 --> 01:31:41.962
the whole world
you existed.

01:31:42.046 --> 01:31:44.173
but what I was really
trying to do

01:31:44.256 --> 01:31:47.384
was convince them
that I exist.

01:31:51.096 --> 01:31:53.015
It's not that
you aren't human.

01:31:55.433 --> 01:31:57.352
It's that I am.

01:34:20.198 --> 01:34:22.283
I'm sorry, Simone.

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:51.479
It is my sad...

01:34:51.562 --> 01:34:54.314
and solemn duty...

01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:57.985
to announce...

01:34:58.068 --> 01:35:01.404
the tragic passing
of Simone.

01:35:06.535 --> 01:35:07.953
How did she die?

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:11.580
It was a rare virus
she contracted

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:15.167
on her Goodwill Tour
of the third world.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.630
Did she suffer?

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:22.717
Mercifully, it was quick.

01:36:15.184 --> 01:36:17.269
I feel awful.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.564
It's a great loss.

01:36:25.611 --> 01:36:28.322
You know, we're going to
have to restructure your deal.

01:36:30.491 --> 01:36:33.117
Can I see you later?

01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:35.787
I mean, go away
for the weekend?

01:36:37.081 --> 01:36:40.083
How could you bring that up
at a time like this?

01:37:00.811 --> 01:37:02.563
One minute, Mr. Taransky.

01:37:07.985 --> 01:37:09.861
Oh my God.

01:37:12.155 --> 01:37:13.740
This has got to be a mistake.

01:37:13.824 --> 01:37:15.575
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:37:15.659 --> 01:37:19.037
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:37:19.079 --> 01:37:20.622
- You don't understand.
- Viktor!

01:37:20.706 --> 01:37:23.709
- It's a mistake!
- I'll call my attorney.

01:37:23.792 --> 01:37:24.917
Dad!

01:37:24.959 --> 01:37:26.919
Elaine, call Bernard!

01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:28.964
That's why
it was so light.

01:37:29.006 --> 01:37:31.383
I heard him say,

01:37:31.425 --> 01:37:35.595
"Die, bitch.
I'll destroy you."

01:37:37.555 --> 01:37:39.599
It was so strange.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.602
He actually wanted
to replace Simone with me

01:37:42.685 --> 01:37:44.604
in his new movie.

01:37:46.689 --> 01:37:48.399
He's a sick man.

01:37:48.482 --> 01:37:51.943
He was a controlling madman.

01:37:52.027 --> 01:37:53.945
She was a prisoner.

01:37:55.323 --> 01:37:57.783
I blame myself.

01:37:57.867 --> 01:38:00.910
I wish I had done more
to stop it.

01:38:03.622 --> 01:38:05.206
Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.

01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:07.792
I'm just trying
to understand here.

01:38:07.876 --> 01:38:10.170
Now, all these films

01:38:10.253 --> 01:38:13.214
and TV appearances
and magazine covers

01:38:13.298 --> 01:38:15.342
and internet interviews,

01:38:15.425 --> 01:38:18.719
publicity photos,
snapshots from her childhood...

01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:22.432
All fake? Hmm?

01:38:22.515 --> 01:38:24.851
This is fake.
This is fake.

01:38:24.935 --> 01:38:26.894
Fake, fake, fake,
fake, fake.

01:38:26.936 --> 01:38:29.438
- All fake?
- Yes.

01:38:29.521 --> 01:38:31.565
You understand perfectly.

01:38:31.649 --> 01:38:34.527
So, I will confess

01:38:34.569 --> 01:38:37.446
to fraud
but not to murder.

01:38:37.529 --> 01:38:39.865
And a fan club
with a worldwide membership

01:38:39.949 --> 01:38:42.743
in the millions,
that's also bogus?

01:38:42.826 --> 01:38:46.412
No. No.
The fan club's real.

01:38:46.496 --> 01:38:48.666
It's just what
they were worshipping

01:38:48.749 --> 01:38:51.085
is a computer code.

01:38:51.168 --> 01:38:53.087
Ones and zeroes.

01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:55.922
You couldn't have killed Simone
because there was no Simone.

01:38:56.547 --> 01:38:58.174
- Right. Exactly.
- And this Hank Aleno

01:38:58.216 --> 01:38:59.968
that you keep
talking about,

01:39:00.009 --> 01:39:03.846
the renowned failure who also
happens to be so conveniently dead,

01:39:03.972 --> 01:39:07.225
now, perhaps this man
that you claim helped invent Simone,

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.894
is an invention himself.

01:39:09.978 --> 01:39:11.853
Oh, no. No.

01:39:11.937 --> 01:39:14.399
This whole thing is insane!

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.900
There is no Simone!

01:39:15.984 --> 01:39:18.444
Look.
Even her name is fake.

01:39:18.486 --> 01:39:20.405
It's not Simone.

01:39:20.446 --> 01:39:23.573
It's "Sim One"-- See?

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:25.575
"Simulation One"!

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:27.412
It's a computer code!

01:39:29.955 --> 01:39:32.082
You really hated her,
didn't you?

01:39:34.626 --> 01:39:38.088
Perhaps you could explain
this to me, Mr. Taransky.

01:39:38.171 --> 01:39:41.300
Or is this tape doctored, too?

01:39:41.383 --> 01:39:44.428
This is footage from the marina's
closed-circuit camera

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:48.264
on the night in question--
altered of course.

01:39:48.306 --> 01:39:50.683
Can you tell us
why you're disposing

01:39:50.766 --> 01:39:53.060
of the body of a woman
who doesn't exist?

01:39:53.145 --> 01:39:55.105
Well, it's not her body.

01:39:56.314 --> 01:39:59.567
It's her body of work.

01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:01.527
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.

01:40:01.611 --> 01:40:03.112
Viktor.

01:40:03.195 --> 01:40:06.365
I know. Look.
Look. Look.

01:40:08.159 --> 01:40:10.453
Why don't you just
come clean? Huh?

01:40:10.536 --> 01:40:13.998
Just tell the truth,
you're gonna feel better afterwards.

01:40:14.081 --> 01:40:16.583
I'm telling the truth,
and I don't feel so good.

01:40:16.666 --> 01:40:19.127
Hey, we all know
what happened.

01:40:19.210 --> 01:40:21.297
In a fit of jealous rage,

01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.091
you killed Simone and you dumped
her body off the boat...

01:40:25.175 --> 01:40:27.969
- Don't say that.
-...that she bought for you.

01:40:28.053 --> 01:40:29.804
I did--
I can prove--

01:40:29.888 --> 01:40:31.264
I can prove it
to you.

01:40:31.348 --> 01:40:32.974
Let me just
take you there.

01:40:33.058 --> 01:40:34.643
I'll take you
to the spot.

01:40:34.684 --> 01:40:36.061
I can prove it.

01:40:36.102 --> 01:40:37.646
Here. Here.
Come on.

01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:39.147
We can just go there,
can't we?

01:40:39.230 --> 01:40:41.815
- Let's just go. I'll take you there.
- Oh, Viktor.

01:40:52.618 --> 01:40:54.328
Okay, good.

01:40:54.411 --> 01:40:56.497
Thank you.
Good work.

01:40:58.415 --> 01:41:00.084
Now you'll see.

01:41:05.839 --> 01:41:07.882
What is this?

01:41:07.966 --> 01:41:10.426
No, there's drives
and discs.

01:41:12.012 --> 01:41:13.472
Where are the discs?

01:41:13.514 --> 01:41:15.432
You have to go back down
and get them.

01:41:15.516 --> 01:41:17.934
- That's where they are.
- We can't go back down there.

01:41:17.976 --> 01:41:20.228
- There's discs down there!
- Calm yourself!

01:41:20.311 --> 01:41:21.980
- Please! Just--
- Sit him down.

01:41:22.063 --> 01:41:23.940
You must go down
and get the drives.

01:41:23.982 --> 01:41:25.942
Hey, you see what's
down there?

01:41:32.657 --> 01:41:34.284
Plead guilty.

01:41:34.367 --> 01:41:35.951
Plead guilty
and throw yourself

01:41:36.034 --> 01:41:37.494
on the mercy
of the court.

01:41:37.536 --> 01:41:39.289
It's the best deal
you're gonna get.

01:41:39.372 --> 01:41:41.416
I could get
the death penalty.

01:41:41.499 --> 01:41:42.959
Yeah. Yeah.

01:41:43.042 --> 01:41:45.043
You certainly will
if you go to trial.

01:41:45.127 --> 01:41:48.255
A jury, in this kind
of ugly mood.

01:41:48.338 --> 01:41:50.632
You killed an icon,
for God's sake.

01:41:50.716 --> 01:41:52.634
- Bernard, listen to me!
- Viktor!

01:41:52.718 --> 01:41:56.263
Bernard,
I didn't kill anyone.

01:41:56.346 --> 01:41:58.307
Viktor, come on,
it's in the paper.

01:41:58.390 --> 01:42:00.058
There's no one to kill.

01:42:01.976 --> 01:42:04.771
Bernard,
I'm a filmmaker.

01:42:05.814 --> 01:42:07.899
I was trying
to say something.

01:42:07.983 --> 01:42:10.901
I wanted recognition.

01:42:10.985 --> 01:42:13.446
I wanted
to be appreciated.

01:42:14.655 --> 01:42:17.533
So I created her.

01:42:18.994 --> 01:42:21.412
Bernard,
there's no one to kill.

01:42:22.663 --> 01:42:24.206
Do you understand?

01:42:25.666 --> 01:42:27.543
An insanity defense.

01:42:30.086 --> 01:42:31.589
Beautiful.

01:42:33.007 --> 01:42:35.468
Fantastic.

01:42:35.551 --> 01:42:37.969
- What are you doing?
- "I created her."

01:42:39.137 --> 01:42:40.805
Viktor! Jesus!

01:42:42.515 --> 01:42:44.268
Jesus Christ, Viktor!

01:42:45.519 --> 01:42:48.063
What am I doing?
Oh, what am I doing?

01:42:49.522 --> 01:42:51.483
- Get me out!
- Viktor!

01:42:51.524 --> 01:42:53.902
Get me another lawyer.
I want another lawyer!

01:42:58.365 --> 01:43:00.242
Why can't people just
take responsibility

01:43:00.325 --> 01:43:01.701
for their actions
anymore, huh?

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:06.372
You know, I can almost
forgive him for killing her.

01:43:07.998 --> 01:43:10.377
But, to deny her existence?

01:43:12.295 --> 01:43:14.213
I can never forgive that.

01:43:14.296 --> 01:43:17.049
Because obviously
she existed, right?

01:43:17.132 --> 01:43:20.344
I know it just as surely
as you're sitting there.

01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:24.265
She was the most
vital woman I ever met.

01:43:24.348 --> 01:43:25.891
So you did meet her?

01:43:25.975 --> 01:43:28.060
Yeah, Lainey,
what are you getting at?

01:43:28.143 --> 01:43:29.728
I'm the head
of a major studio.

01:43:29.812 --> 01:43:32.272
Do you think I'm gonna make
a three-picture deal

01:43:32.355 --> 01:43:33.648
with an actress
I never met?

01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:34.899
No. No.

01:43:34.983 --> 01:43:38.571
I mean, really meet her.
Like in the flesh.

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:43.199
I know it's embarrassing
to admit it,

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:47.704
but when I think about it
honestly, I haven't.

01:43:47.787 --> 01:43:49.789
I've never really seen
Simone up close...

01:43:49.872 --> 01:43:51.624
touched her.

01:43:51.708 --> 01:43:54.460
Been in her physical presence.

01:43:54.544 --> 01:43:56.337
Have you?

01:43:58.505 --> 01:43:59.798
Well--

01:43:59.881 --> 01:44:01.675
we don't want
to believe daddy

01:44:01.717 --> 01:44:04.721
because we don't want to believe
that we were taken in too.

01:44:05.805 --> 01:44:07.014
But, Lainey,

01:44:09.474 --> 01:44:12.728
there's no evidence
that Simone isn't real.

01:44:12.769 --> 01:44:14.646
Listen to what
you're saying, Mom.

01:44:14.730 --> 01:44:17.065
I mean, is there
any evidence that she is?

01:44:24.448 --> 01:44:26.240
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

01:44:34.332 --> 01:44:35.458
What's that?

01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:38.753
One part of Dad's story
may have been true.

01:44:38.836 --> 01:44:41.088
Simone may have
contracted a virus.

01:44:43.674 --> 01:44:45.551
Certain viruses
can be cured.

01:44:48.471 --> 01:44:50.556
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:45:07.781 --> 01:45:09.366
Listen to me.

01:45:09.449 --> 01:45:11.910
There's a psychiatrist
in Ventura,

01:45:11.952 --> 01:45:14.371
well-respected,
who is willing to testify

01:45:14.454 --> 01:45:17.916
under oath that you have
diminished capacity

01:45:19.124 --> 01:45:21.293
due to the trauma
of your divorce,

01:45:21.377 --> 01:45:24.839
10 years of abject failure
in the movie business

01:45:24.923 --> 01:45:27.800
and a bump on the head

01:45:27.841 --> 01:45:29.343
you sustained as a child.

01:45:29.426 --> 01:45:31.845
No more.

01:45:31.887 --> 01:45:35.058
I can't go along
with this horseshit.

01:45:35.141 --> 01:45:37.434
- Come on, Viktor.
- I did it.

01:45:37.476 --> 01:45:39.061
No. No.
Viktor, come on.

01:45:39.144 --> 01:45:41.897
- Tell them they can fry me.
- No, Viktor, please.

01:45:43.649 --> 01:45:45.567
- I did it!
- Viktor, please.

01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:47.569
It was premeditated!

01:45:47.652 --> 01:45:50.573
- Can you please lower your voice?
- I strangled her.

01:45:50.656 --> 01:45:53.950
I bludgeoned her!

01:45:53.992 --> 01:45:56.244
I set her on fire

01:45:56.327 --> 01:45:58.955
and then I killed her!

01:45:58.997 --> 01:46:01.875
- I did it!
- Excuse me.

01:46:01.917 --> 01:46:04.210
I think you better
see this.

01:46:14.304 --> 01:46:15.263
Breaking news:

01:46:15.346 --> 01:46:19.517
International media star
Simone is alive and well.

01:46:19.601 --> 01:46:22.269
Her studio released this footage,
just minutes ago.

01:46:22.352 --> 01:46:26.356
Simone reading today's edition
of "The LA Times."

01:46:31.445 --> 01:46:34.364
Who says the only bad publicity
is your obituary?

01:46:34.406 --> 01:46:36.366
Details at the top
of the hour.

01:46:37.659 --> 01:46:39.577
She's indestructible.

01:46:51.756 --> 01:46:53.424
He's coming.

01:47:01.182 --> 01:47:03.142
Viktor.

01:47:03.226 --> 01:47:05.269
Oh, Viktor.

01:47:05.311 --> 01:47:06.979
Oh, honey.

01:47:10.441 --> 01:47:13.194
I don't know what you did
or how you did it,

01:47:13.277 --> 01:47:15.570
- but thank you.
- Well, it was Lainey.

01:47:15.654 --> 01:47:17.530
But don't thank us
too fast.

01:47:17.614 --> 01:47:19.532
You know what we have
to do now.

01:47:19.616 --> 01:47:21.035
What?

01:47:21.077 --> 01:47:23.370
Well, why stop
at one character

01:47:23.453 --> 01:47:25.705
when you can have
a whole cast?

01:47:25.789 --> 01:47:27.916
You have to finish
what you started.

01:47:27.999 --> 01:47:29.918
We can do it together.

01:47:30.001 --> 01:47:33.003
- Haven't we done enough?
- Could we go, please?

01:47:33.088 --> 01:47:34.923
Where we going?

01:47:34.965 --> 01:47:37.217
Well, I was thinking...

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.386
how about you and Simone,

01:47:39.427 --> 01:47:41.387
moving in with me and Lainey?

01:47:46.810 --> 01:47:48.228
That's wonderful.

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.188
What do you think, Lainey?

01:47:51.272 --> 01:47:52.856
About you and Mom?

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:56.443
Well, about me and Simone.

01:47:56.527 --> 01:47:58.654
What I did.

01:47:58.737 --> 01:48:00.281
Everything.
I'm sorry.

01:48:00.364 --> 01:48:03.492
Your mistake wasn't
making something fake, Dad.

01:48:03.576 --> 01:48:05.452
We're fine with fake.

01:48:05.536 --> 01:48:07.621
As long as you don't lie
about it.

01:48:12.417 --> 01:48:14.044
Oh, come on, Viktor.

01:48:14.128 --> 01:48:16.130
It's not
a death sentence.

01:48:17.463 --> 01:48:20.216
No. It's life.

01:48:28.766 --> 01:48:30.518
Hey, Viktor,
remember us?

01:48:30.602 --> 01:48:32.896
We probably never met.
I'm Milton.

01:48:32.937 --> 01:48:35.731
How are you?
Max Sayer from the Echo.

01:48:35.772 --> 01:48:38.191
- Hi!
- It's life.

01:48:43.864 --> 01:48:45.365
Just call.
Five minutes.

01:48:45.449 --> 01:48:46.909
All we need
is five minutes.

01:49:00.714 --> 01:49:03.174
Good evening,
and welcome.

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:06.511
Simone, the question

01:49:06.553 --> 01:49:10.848
on everybody's mind
is simply... why?

01:49:10.932 --> 01:49:13.017
Frank, you know
as well as I do,

01:49:13.059 --> 01:49:15.144
Iiving in this fish-bowl,

01:49:15.228 --> 01:49:17.855
the insatiable appetite
of the media,

01:49:17.939 --> 01:49:20.358
with everything
that was going on in my life,

01:49:20.399 --> 01:49:23.194
I just needed to drop out
of sight for a while.

01:49:23.236 --> 01:49:27.198
I needed time,
and Viktor bought me that time.

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.659
- I owe him so much.
- We all do.

01:49:32.578 --> 01:49:34.497
But now I understand
you're eager

01:49:34.538 --> 01:49:36.207
to get back to work

01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:38.041
and it's not the kind
of work

01:49:38.124 --> 01:49:40.377
we were all expecting.

01:49:40.418 --> 01:49:42.045
It's true.

01:49:42.128 --> 01:49:46.466
I can reveal I am considering
a career in politics.

01:49:46.549 --> 01:49:49.094
And what, may I ask,
brought this on?

01:49:51.805 --> 01:49:55.349
I suppose this little man
had something to do with it.

01:49:55.432 --> 01:49:58.019
- That beautiful baby.
- Yes.

01:49:58.103 --> 01:50:00.981
You see, Viktor and I
are both very concerned

01:50:01.022 --> 01:50:03.400
about what kind of world
our new son, Chip,

01:50:03.483 --> 01:50:05.234
is going to grow up in.

01:50:06.652 --> 01:50:08.404
Aren't you, Viktor?

01:50:08.487 --> 01:50:10.239
Oh, yes.

01:50:11.491 --> 01:50:13.076
Hi.

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:18.080
Oh yes.

01:50:30.134 --> 01:50:32.218
# Looking out #

01:50:32.302 --> 01:50:35.889
# On the morning rain #

01:50:35.972 --> 01:50:40.018
# I used to feel
so inspired #

01:50:42.687 --> 01:50:46.608
# And when I knew
I had to face another day #

01:50:48.818 --> 01:50:52.447
# Lord, it made me feel so tired #

01:50:54.824 --> 01:50:57.493
# Before the day I met you #

01:50:57.577 --> 01:51:00.704
# Life was so unkind #

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:05.251
# You're the key
to my peace of mind #

01:51:05.251 --> 01:51:08.879
# 'Cause you make me feel #

01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:12.090
# You make me feel #

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:18.305
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

01:51:21.642 --> 01:51:25.561
# When my soul was
in the lost and found #

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:31.526
# You came along to claim it #

01:51:34.153 --> 01:51:40.076
# And didn't know
what was wrong with me #

01:51:40.159 --> 01:51:44.038
# Till your kiss helped me name it #

01:51:46.249 --> 01:51:49.210
# Now I'm no longer
doubtful #

01:51:49.293 --> 01:51:52.087
# To what I'm living for #

01:51:52.128 --> 01:51:54.172
# And if I make you happy #

01:51:54.256 --> 01:51:56.801
# I don't need to do more #

01:51:56.884 --> 01:52:00.429
# 'Cause you make me feel #

01:52:00.512 --> 01:52:03.431
# You make me feel #

01:52:03.515 --> 01:52:10.021
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

01:52:10.105 --> 01:52:12.566
# Woman #

01:52:12.607 --> 01:52:16.236
# Oh, baby, what you've done to me #

01:52:16.319 --> 01:52:18.238
# Done to me #

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:22.826
# You make me feel
so good inside #

01:52:22.867 --> 01:52:25.412
# Good inside #

01:52:25.495 --> 01:52:29.456
# And I just wanna be #

01:52:29.498 --> 01:52:31.375
# Wanna be #

01:52:31.458 --> 01:52:35.338
# Close to you,
you make me feel so alive #

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:38.382
# 'Cause you make me feel #

01:52:38.424 --> 01:52:42.052
# You make me feel #

01:52:42.136 --> 01:52:48.601
# You make me feel
like a natural woman #

01:52:48.642 --> 01:52:51.270
# You make me feel #

01:52:51.353 --> 01:52:54.814
# You make me feel #

01:52:54.898 --> 01:53:01.529
# You make me feel
like a real... #

01:53:03.281 --> 01:53:06.492
# You make me feel #

01:53:06.534 --> 01:53:09.662
# Feel like a real... #

01:53:09.746 --> 01:53:15.001
# You make me feel
like a real... #

01:57:15.149 --> 01:57:17.818
She likes
chicken pot pie...

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:19.987
just like me.
