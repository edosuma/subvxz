00:02.840 --> 00:03.741
<i>Previously on "Bel-Air..."</i>

00:03.841 --> 00:04.702
- Erika?
- Philip?

00:06.244 --> 00:07.545
Are you still upset
about the Erika thing?

00:07.645 --> 00:09.747
'Cause it's not a thing.
- It was a thing.

00:09.847 --> 00:12.630
A very big thing, so please
don't play me like I'm crazy.

00:12.730 --> 00:14.672
Keep posting, okay?
And tag them.

00:14.772 --> 00:17.115
Visibility for the artist,
visibility for the house.

00:17.215 --> 00:18.636
Well, who is this artist?
It says anonymous.

00:18.736 --> 00:19.597
What?

00:19.697 --> 00:21.279
Have you talked to Jazz
recently?

00:21.379 --> 00:22.600
He's been acting
really distant.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.802
<i>Finding out you dated
a top NFL draft pick</i>

00:24.902 --> 00:26.124
<i>could hurt a brother's pride.</i>

00:26.224 --> 00:27.885
- I have no agenda.
- Good.

00:27.985 --> 00:31.089
'Cause I have a man.
- So why isn't he here then?

00:31.189 --> 00:33.931
We know you been looking
for Frederick.

00:34.031 --> 00:35.093
- Yeah.
- Lord knows we learned

00:35.193 --> 00:37.535
the consequences
of keeping family apart.

00:37.635 --> 00:39.817
<i>Know this has to be
your decision.</i>

00:39.917 --> 00:41.339
<i>Not ours.</i>

00:41.439 --> 00:42.860
<i>It's so cool that both</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:45.543
Will and Carlton got nominated
for the Founder's Award.

00:45.643 --> 00:47.945
Okay, I'm focused on AAU,
and that's it.

00:48.045 --> 00:49.347
Founder's Award
is Carlton's thing.

00:49.447 --> 00:52.470
D-I schools--they looking
for leadership skills too.

00:52.570 --> 00:54.632
Don't be so quick to count
yourself out.

00:54.732 --> 00:56.354
I'm not afraid
of a little competition.

00:56.454 --> 00:58.276
You should stay in the race.
- Oh, that's good,

00:58.376 --> 00:59.177
'cause I was gonna
do that anyway.

01:08.426 --> 01:09.727
They're coming,
they're coming, they're coming.

01:09.827 --> 01:12.210
Okay, table's set.
Everything's ready.

01:12.310 --> 01:14.252
Good morning, boys.

01:14.352 --> 01:16.354
- Good morning.
- Hey.

01:17.795 --> 01:18.816
both: Surprise!

01:18.916 --> 01:20.378
I hope you're hungry
for some pancakes.

01:20.478 --> 01:23.021
- You need something.
- What's the occasion?

01:23.121 --> 01:24.902
Well, we just thought
that we'd do something special

01:25.002 --> 01:26.384
that says congratulations.

01:26.484 --> 01:29.347
We have two Founder's Award
nominees in the house.

01:29.447 --> 01:30.748
That's a big deal.
- Yeah.

01:30.848 --> 01:33.551
And an even bigger deal
that you both decided to run.

01:33.651 --> 01:35.273
I mean, yeah, you know, this
could be a huge deal for me.

01:35.373 --> 01:37.155
Scholarships, internships.

01:37.255 --> 01:39.397
I mean, becoming
a multi-million-dollar CEO.

01:39.497 --> 01:42.200
Whoa, CEO? Slow down.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.961
- What's funny about that?
- Oh, nothing.

01:44.061 --> 01:46.364
It's just that you finally have
ambitions higher than the NBA.

01:46.464 --> 01:47.725
Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm coming for everything.

01:47.825 --> 01:49.607
I'll beat you on the classroom
and on the court.

01:49.707 --> 01:51.849
I'm pretty sure I have
a higher GPA than you.

01:51.949 --> 01:53.051
- Debatable.
- Okay, see?

01:53.151 --> 01:54.452
That's exactly
what I was talking about.

01:54.552 --> 01:55.693
She's just worried about

01:55.793 --> 01:57.295
the two of you
going up against each other.

01:57.395 --> 01:59.297
That's a lot of competitive
energy under one roof.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.259
Don't act like you two
don't have history.

02:01.359 --> 02:03.861
Look, I understand how,
as a mother, it's your job

02:03.961 --> 02:06.504
to obsessively worry about
everything, but we're fine.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.346
Yeah, it's all good,
Aunt Viv.

02:08.446 --> 02:12.230
Just some healthy competition
between cousins.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.192
- That I'm gonna win.
- Not quite.

Damn, man.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.210
Why does that keep happening?

02:32.310 --> 02:34.252
Because, Will,

02:34.352 --> 02:35.653
rule number one of golf is,

02:35.753 --> 02:37.495
never take your eyes
off the ball.

02:37.595 --> 02:41.259
And also...

02:41.359 --> 02:43.581
you suck.

02:43.681 --> 02:45.803
Let's see what you got,
and it better be good.

02:51.369 --> 02:53.871
Damn.
- Yes, there it is.

02:53.971 --> 02:55.993
- Nice shot, son.
- You know, I'm not so sure

02:56.093 --> 02:58.436
Will is cut out
for this level of competition.

02:58.536 --> 03:00.077
Yeah, well,
sticking tiny balls

03:00.177 --> 03:01.359
into holes is your thing, Carlton.

03:01.459 --> 03:02.840
Give me the rock and I'll show
you what I can do.

03:02.940 --> 03:05.042
Ah, it's a shame
a dunk contest

03:05.142 --> 03:07.044
isn't a Founder's Award event.

03:07.144 --> 03:08.846
- Founder's Award event.
- You know, he's right, Will.

03:08.946 --> 03:11.849
The alumni golf tournament will
be an opportunity to impress,

03:11.949 --> 03:13.050
and I just want to make sure

03:13.150 --> 03:15.152
that both of you
make a good showing.

03:19.637 --> 03:22.500
Nice one, Dad.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.821
And I'm sure Will
could use the help.

03:23.921 --> 03:25.463
And I'm sure you could use
the height.

03:25.563 --> 03:26.784
But it's not really fair

03:26.884 --> 03:28.746
when you have a ten-year
head start, so...

03:28.846 --> 03:29.747
Well, the links are

03:29.847 --> 03:31.429
a corporate boardroom
in disguise.

03:31.529 --> 03:33.151
It's where money
and deals are made.

03:33.251 --> 03:35.233
Ain't that right, Geoffrey?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.915
Yeah. Absolutely.

03:38.015 --> 03:40.958
Hey, back up, man.

03:41.058 --> 03:43.481
Uh.

03:43.581 --> 03:44.802
It's all right.
We'll help you get there, Will.

03:44.902 --> 03:47.124
Just takes practice
and a lot of patience.

03:47.224 --> 03:48.486
- Thanks, Uncle Phil.
- Course.

03:48.586 --> 03:50.488
You know, I was thinking,

03:50.588 --> 03:52.049
maybe later, I could help you
pull together

03:52.149 --> 03:53.251
some of your talking points

03:53.351 --> 03:54.532
for the "Meet the Nominees"
forum.

03:54.632 --> 03:56.294
Yeah, that'd be dope.

03:56.394 --> 03:59.056
You know, you're looking
at a Distinguished Toastmaster.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.058
Wait, you never told me

04:01.158 --> 04:02.860
you were
a Distinguished Toastmaster.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.021
I don't know what that is,

04:04.121 --> 04:05.703
but if it's gonna help me win,
that's cool.

04:08.406 --> 04:10.628
Viv, hey.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.910
Yeah, we're all right here.

04:13.010 --> 04:14.312
All right, I'll let him know.

04:14.412 --> 04:17.154
Love you too.

04:17.254 --> 04:19.917
It's that time.
You ready?

04:20.017 --> 04:22.500
Yeah. Of course.

04:31.028 --> 04:32.169
Are you good?

04:32.269 --> 04:35.172
- Just need a minute.
- Yeah.

04:35.272 --> 04:38.436
Hey, you got this, G.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.811
Frederick.

05:00.297 --> 05:02.299
Geoffrey.

05:04.181 --> 05:06.183

05:28.806 --> 05:30.908
I was pleased to know

05:31.008 --> 05:32.149
that you got adopted
pretty early

05:32.249 --> 05:33.671
out of the care system.

05:33.771 --> 05:36.153
Five years old.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.255
One of the lucky ones, I guess.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.286
So what?
You're not a big eater?

05:48.386 --> 05:50.988
No, I am. Just not today.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.733
I'm not usually
this quiet either.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.255
It's just...

05:58.355 --> 06:02.019
this whole this
is... just feels...

06:02.119 --> 06:04.302
unreal.

06:04.402 --> 06:06.464
Yeah.

06:06.564 --> 06:08.566
I get it.

06:11.288 --> 06:15.473
When I was a kid, I thought
maybe I made you up

06:15.573 --> 06:19.717
and you was a story I told
myself just to get to sleep.

06:19.817 --> 06:21.959
It's easy to pretend
you never really existed.

06:25.863 --> 06:29.086
But clearly, you do.

06:33.150 --> 06:35.573
Frederick,

06:35.673 --> 06:38.416
I know it can't be easy.

06:38.516 --> 06:42.259
After all these years,
suddenly getting a call

06:42.359 --> 06:44.301
and a plane ticket
from a complete stranger.

06:44.401 --> 06:47.505
Not a complete stranger.

06:47.605 --> 06:51.349
I run into people
that claim they knew you.

06:51.449 --> 06:53.751
Lots of stories.

06:53.851 --> 06:55.593
Yeah, well,

06:55.693 --> 06:59.677
you can't believe
everything you hear.

06:59.777 --> 07:02.520
And that's why I came.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.442
I want to find out for myself.

07:04.542 --> 07:07.985
And I'm prepared
to tell you everything.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.537
Looks good, son.
Love the photo.

07:19.637 --> 07:23.701
I'm going for a 2008 DNC vibe

07:23.801 --> 07:26.343
kind of mixed with an early
Adam Clayton Powell Jr.

07:26.443 --> 07:29.947
Well, it's good to see
you're focused on your goals.

07:30.047 --> 07:31.469
Thanks, Dad.

07:31.569 --> 07:34.191
So tell me, how's Will doing
on his side of things?

07:34.291 --> 07:36.193
We're in the Colosseum, Dad.

07:36.293 --> 07:38.115
He's my competition.
- Right.

07:38.215 --> 07:39.276
Let's hope you're okay with

07:39.376 --> 07:41.038
the extra push
I've been giving him.

07:41.138 --> 07:42.720
He's not quite
as focused as you.

07:42.820 --> 07:44.281
You know,
the Founder's Award competition

07:44.381 --> 07:46.283
is a much bigger stretch.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.965
I just wanted to make sure that

07:48.065 --> 07:51.529
he's getting the support
that he needs.

07:51.629 --> 07:53.290
Of course.

07:53.390 --> 07:57.535
Will needs you more than me,
so support away.

07:57.635 --> 08:00.157
Great.
I'm glad you understand.

08:05.643 --> 08:07.645
Yep.

08:14.091 --> 08:15.913
All right, here you go, man.

08:16.013 --> 08:18.796
Take care.
- Thanks, brother.

08:18.896 --> 08:23.400
So anything going on
with you and Hilary?

08:23.500 --> 08:24.922
Since when are you
so invested

08:25.022 --> 08:26.283
in our relationship?

08:26.383 --> 08:29.447
Since all she does is ask
about your ass, boy.

08:29.547 --> 08:31.689
- Word?
- Yeah, man.

08:31.789 --> 08:33.691
Look, look, she just wants you
to take charge, okay?

08:33.791 --> 08:36.013
Make your presence felt
before it's too late.

08:36.113 --> 08:38.175
Why would it be too late?

08:38.275 --> 08:39.857
No reason.

08:39.957 --> 08:42.019
And he feels really bad that he
let the whole LaMarcus thing

08:42.119 --> 08:44.181
get to his head, but trust me.
He wants to fix things.

08:44.281 --> 08:45.743
Then why didn't he
just say that?

08:45.843 --> 08:48.185
Well, I think he's just
trying to give you your space.

08:48.285 --> 08:50.908
Space?
Why would I need space?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.109
No. No, no, no.

08:52.209 --> 08:53.551
Space is the last thing
she needs.

08:53.651 --> 08:55.352
Look, man, you just need
to get out your feelings

08:55.452 --> 08:57.795
and step
your boyfriend game up.

08:57.895 --> 08:58.876
She really say that?

08:58.976 --> 09:00.117
No, no, no, no.
I'm just saying, man,

09:00.217 --> 09:01.679
you two have been trippin'
long enough.

09:01.779 --> 09:03.681
Y'all gotta get it together.
A'ight?

09:03.781 --> 09:05.563
Now's the time.

09:05.663 --> 09:07.204
I just feel like
something like this,

09:07.304 --> 09:08.486
it should've made us stronger.

09:08.586 --> 09:10.127
Like we should be solid
at this point.

09:10.227 --> 09:11.649
Yeah, I hear ya.

09:11.749 --> 09:13.851
Listen, Will, it's just that
I need him to make an effort.

09:13.951 --> 09:15.452
You know, so I don't think
I'm the only one here

09:15.552 --> 09:16.774
who's miserable.
- I feel you.

09:16.874 --> 09:19.216
So when you say
making an effort...

09:19.316 --> 09:21.779
Anything. Literally anything.
Try. Show up.

09:21.879 --> 09:24.021
Plan a date or something.
- Okay, I get it.

09:24.121 --> 09:25.222
So you mean like
Netflix and chill.

09:25.322 --> 09:27.024
- Bigger.
- Dinner and a movie.

09:27.124 --> 09:29.306
Bigger. I'm talking about,
like, super expensive,

09:29.406 --> 09:35.192
super impressive.

Losing Garrison Automotive
as a client,

you know, that put us
at a huge disadvantage,

10:08.846 --> 10:09.787
so where are we?

10:09.887 --> 10:11.188
Are we bringing
that business back?

10:11.288 --> 10:13.671
It's just taking a little
longer than I anticipated.

10:13.771 --> 10:15.152
Okay, now, what's that
even mean?

10:15.252 --> 10:16.513
I mean, if Garrison
doesn't return,

10:16.613 --> 10:18.435
that's 0% chance of us
stopping this acquisition.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.678
I know.
Tell the partners to chill.

10:20.778 --> 10:22.920
I just need a little more time
and they need to trust that

10:23.020 --> 10:24.521
I'm working all the angles.
Sound good?

10:24.621 --> 10:27.364
No. That sounds like
a lot of bullshit actually.

10:27.464 --> 10:29.526
Look, we been riding together
for over 20 years.

10:29.626 --> 10:31.288
Have I ever not delivered
when I said I would?

10:31.388 --> 10:33.811
- No, but...
- So don't worry.

10:33.911 --> 10:36.333
We're gonna make this work.
We'll get it done.

10:36.433 --> 10:38.015
Well, we better,

10:38.115 --> 10:39.857
'cause right now, we don't have
any other options.

10:39.957 --> 10:41.959
Yeah?

10:56.854 --> 11:00.477
"Banks' show offers tasty
morsels of fascinating new art,

11:00.577 --> 11:03.400
but never enough
of a full entrée."

11:03.500 --> 11:05.763
What is going on?
Is Janice dragging you again?

11:05.863 --> 11:07.524
This woman has
way too much free time.

11:07.624 --> 11:08.606
She keeps emailing me

11:08.706 --> 11:10.007
negative reviews
of my art show,

11:10.107 --> 11:12.850
and you know she condemned
the anonymous piece as being

11:12.950 --> 11:13.891
way too provocative?

11:13.991 --> 11:16.253
Okay, this woman is
way off base.

11:16.353 --> 11:18.135
That piece was the highlight
of the night.

11:18.235 --> 11:20.457
I mean, look.

11:20.557 --> 11:22.179
It's my most popular post.

11:22.279 --> 11:25.983
746,365 likes.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.105
My piece is getting
this much attention?

11:28.205 --> 11:30.387
Hold up, hold up.

11:30.487 --> 11:32.469
You're the artist
behind "Living in Silence"?

11:32.569 --> 11:34.351
Why didn't you say anything?

11:34.451 --> 11:37.074
People are obsessed.
I'm obsessed.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.036
Everyone's trying to figure out
who the artist is.

11:39.136 --> 11:40.357
What?

11:40.457 --> 11:42.920
I mean, I guess I'm just trying
to be respectful

11:43.020 --> 11:44.521
of my role in the fellowship.
- Uh-uh.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.363
Mom, you need
to ignore the noise

11:46.463 --> 11:48.045
and tap into this new audience.

11:48.145 --> 11:50.547
Look, don't worry.
I'll teach you everything.

11:52.469 --> 11:53.891
Okay.

11:53.991 --> 11:56.133
Okay, so basically,
this is how it goes.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.294
When you post something,

11:57.394 --> 11:58.335
you wanna tag
whoever's important.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.062
Hey, Will, you almost here?
Ready to rock?

12:05.162 --> 12:06.864
Hey, I'm not gonna be able
to make it, Uncle Phil.

12:06.964 --> 12:08.345
Doc just called
an extra team practice.

12:08.445 --> 12:09.466
<i>I thought you wanted
to work</i>

12:09.566 --> 12:10.908
on talking points
for the nominees event.

12:11.008 --> 12:13.350
Well, I do, but I can't
just miss a practice.

12:13.450 --> 12:14.291
I still gotta show
my commitment

12:14.291 --> 12:15.472
to Doc and the team.

12:15.572 --> 12:16.413
<i>Well, what about
your commitment</i>

12:16.413 --> 12:17.474
to the Founder's Award?

12:17.574 --> 12:18.595
<i>I'm still committed.</i>

12:18.695 --> 12:19.997
I'm just trying
to balance it all.

12:20.097 --> 12:21.358
<i>But it's good.
I got it, though, all right?</i>

12:21.458 --> 12:23.080
Hey, I got to go, Uncle Phil.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.302
Thanks for understanding.
- All right, nephew.

12:30.347 --> 12:32.409
You're late, Bel-Air.

12:32.509 --> 12:33.490
Hustle up.
- All right.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.372
Got here as fast as I could.

12:35.472 --> 12:37.474
What y'all standing around for?

12:52.609 --> 12:56.954
Oh, the overachieving angle. Original.

12:57.054 --> 12:58.195
Let me guess.

12:58.295 --> 13:02.039
LAX bros for life meets
polos in white paradise?

13:02.139 --> 13:03.180
Just giving the people
what they want.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.922
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
the people

13:05.022 --> 13:07.364
don't want another
pompous, cocky asshole.

13:07.464 --> 13:09.526
Then you
definitely won't win.

13:10.547 --> 13:12.449
Good luck, Banks.

13:12.549 --> 13:15.813
Lisa. Lisa.

13:15.913 --> 13:19.456
Can you just--
can you just wait?

13:19.556 --> 13:21.018
Look, I know you been
icing me out

13:21.118 --> 13:22.259
since I had that fight
with Carlton.

13:22.359 --> 13:25.342
He's my friend,
and I don't do bullies, Drew.

13:25.442 --> 13:26.944
That's not who I am.

13:27.044 --> 13:29.386
And I don't want you thinking
the worst of me.

13:29.486 --> 13:32.389
Look, I like you a lot,
and I fucked up.

13:32.489 --> 13:34.231
Yeah, you did.

13:34.331 --> 13:36.473
Maybe tomorrow we can catch
up after school.

13:36.573 --> 13:39.977
Grab a bite.
Start over.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.342
- We'll see.
- Okay.

13:48.986 --> 13:51.869
So where's our BSU nominee?

13:56.633 --> 13:59.616
Right, to be clear, I'm only
doing this as a favour to you.

13:59.716 --> 14:00.778
Okay? No commitments.

14:00.878 --> 14:02.339
Well, I'm just glad
you came in.

14:02.439 --> 14:03.660
You left me no choice.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.801
You've been blowing up
my phone for two weeks.

14:04.801 --> 14:06.583
Viv really appreciated that,
by the way.

14:06.683 --> 14:08.665
My bad.
Yeah, I didn't get this far

14:08.765 --> 14:11.969
not being persistent.
I know how to get what I want.

14:17.054 --> 14:19.316
Everyone, this is Philip Banks.

14:19.416 --> 14:22.039
Philip, this is
the top leadership of the firm.

14:22.139 --> 14:24.641
Well, I wasn't expecting
a full house.

14:24.741 --> 14:28.285
I would've worn a nicer suit.

14:28.385 --> 14:29.967
You took time out
of your schedule to be here.

14:30.067 --> 14:34.371
The least we could do
is give you a proper welcome.

14:34.471 --> 14:35.772
We have partners
from our offices

14:35.872 --> 14:36.934
in D.C...
- Thank you.

14:37.034 --> 14:39.496
New York, Tokyo,
London, Paris,

14:39.596 --> 14:42.539
Sydney, Dubai, Toronto, Frankfurt,

14:42.639 --> 14:46.463
Hong Kong, Singapore,
and Bangladesh.

14:46.563 --> 14:49.827
Wow. Okay. Hello.

14:49.927 --> 14:52.309
We're grateful that Erika
got you in the door,

14:52.409 --> 14:54.111
but it's our job to make sure
you come back.

14:54.211 --> 14:56.753
What you've done
at Banks, Johnson, and Lewis,

14:56.853 --> 14:58.515
evolving it
into a general practice,

14:58.615 --> 15:00.757
handling criminal defence,
class actions,

15:00.857 --> 15:04.401
commercial transactions,
it's beyond impressive.

15:04.501 --> 15:05.963
Thank you.

15:06.063 --> 15:07.764
I put my life's work
into building that firm.

15:07.864 --> 15:09.446
But we know times
are changing.

15:09.546 --> 15:11.648
But we'd like to bring you in
as an equity partner

15:11.748 --> 15:13.250
to control our West Coast team.

15:13.350 --> 15:15.532
That's ten offices,
over five times as many lawyers

15:15.632 --> 15:16.813
as your entire firm.

15:16.913 --> 15:18.655
An army of seasoned attorneys

15:18.755 --> 15:20.257
and top law school graduates,

15:20.357 --> 15:22.499
all ready to go to work
for Philip Banks.

15:22.599 --> 15:24.061
And to make
some real progress

15:24.161 --> 15:28.745
on those social justice reforms
you wanted to implement as DA.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.388
Okay. What's the catch?

15:31.488 --> 15:33.030
Offer's already
in your inbox.

15:33.130 --> 15:33.830
Comb through it.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.932
You won't find a catch.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.196
Sky's the limit here.

15:39.296 --> 15:42.519
You can create whatever future
you envision for yourself.

15:42.619 --> 15:44.281
We just want
to be a part of it.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.371
And this is home, sweet home.

15:54.471 --> 15:56.653
You didn't mention nothing
about living in no castle.

15:58.155 --> 16:01.138
I manage the affairs
of family operations.

16:01.238 --> 16:04.061
Real talk?
Living here is just a perk.

16:04.161 --> 16:06.303
No big deal.
- Ah, this house may not be

16:06.403 --> 16:10.267
a big deal,
but Geoffrey certainly is.

16:10.367 --> 16:12.389
Good to see you, Frederick.

16:12.489 --> 16:14.351
How was your first night in LA?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.673
Yeah, I was a little
jet-lagged, but all good.

16:16.773 --> 16:19.716
Hi, Frederick. I'm Hilary.
Nice to meet you.

16:19.816 --> 16:22.799
- Pleasure to meet you too.
- Okay, accent.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.002
Thank you for having me.
This is a lovely home.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.405
That's all thanks
to your father Geoffrey.

16:28.505 --> 16:29.686
I mean, because of him,

16:29.786 --> 16:31.448
this place is like
a well-oiled machine.

16:31.548 --> 16:32.849
That's a fact.
We wouldn't know

16:32.949 --> 16:34.571
what to do without Geoffrey.
He always knows

16:34.671 --> 16:36.253
what's going on.
When I was a little girl,

16:36.353 --> 16:37.935
he stopped me from running away
three times.

16:38.035 --> 16:39.456
Three?

16:39.556 --> 16:41.418
The point is, we are just

16:41.518 --> 16:44.821
so blessed to have Geoffrey
as a part of this family.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.824
Which means you're family,
too, okay?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.426
It's nice to be included
out of choice

16:49.526 --> 16:50.587
instead of circumstance.

16:50.687 --> 16:52.689
That's definitely new to me.

16:56.813 --> 16:58.815
He's here.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.561
So as you know, my family was

17:04.661 --> 17:06.843
a big part in building
this great institution, right?

17:06.943 --> 17:09.366
So the foundation
and the legacy of this school,

17:09.466 --> 17:10.567
they run through my blood.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.529
And look,
I absolutely understand.

17:12.629 --> 17:15.492
Right now seems like
a dire time to be a student,

17:15.592 --> 17:18.415
but my good friend, Obama, says

17:18.515 --> 17:20.417
that we, as a generation,

17:20.517 --> 17:22.819
were born in the best time
in history.

17:22.919 --> 17:24.341
We're more likely
to be literate,

17:24.441 --> 17:26.583
healthy, and free
to pursue our dreams.

17:26.683 --> 17:29.786
I want to use this award
to make good on those dreams.

17:29.886 --> 17:31.508
Really--
- Sorry I'm late.

17:31.608 --> 17:34.591
Oh, man.

17:34.691 --> 17:36.353
Will, what are your thoughts

17:36.453 --> 17:37.914
on the history
of the Founder's Award?

17:38.014 --> 17:40.357
Yeah, what are
your thoughts, Will?

17:40.457 --> 17:41.999
Right.

17:42.099 --> 17:44.561
History of the Founder's Award.

17:44.661 --> 17:45.842
Boy, there's a lot of history.

17:45.942 --> 17:47.764
Uh, I do have notes.

17:47.864 --> 17:51.308
I'm just trying to find them.

17:53.710 --> 17:58.095
Okay, fuck the talking points.
I don't have an agenda.

17:58.195 --> 18:01.338
Obviously.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.180
But this is me.

18:03.280 --> 18:03.980
The real me.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.422
And my mom, Viola Smith--

18:05.522 --> 18:08.825
she always raised me to speak
from the heart.

18:08.925 --> 18:10.507
You know,
it's about who you are

18:10.607 --> 18:12.269
and what you believe in.

18:12.369 --> 18:14.911
You know, what you'll stand for
and what you won't fall for.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.835
You know, it's not about
how good you look in a suit.

18:18.935 --> 18:21.518
Or on paper.

18:21.618 --> 18:22.839
You know?

18:22.939 --> 18:25.362
'Cause once all that shit
is stripped away,

18:25.462 --> 18:29.206
what do you have left?

18:29.306 --> 18:32.529
I don't know.
I think...

18:32.629 --> 18:35.192
I think that'll show you
what a true leader looks like.

18:40.397 --> 18:42.018
But can you
contextualise that

18:42.118 --> 18:43.820
within the five principles
of the Founder's Award?

18:43.920 --> 18:46.223
Uh, the five principles.

18:46.323 --> 18:50.227
Yes.
Let me figure that out for you.

18:50.327 --> 18:53.510
Right. Well, as painful
as this is to watch,

18:53.610 --> 18:56.513
I can tell you that
as the award recipient,

18:56.613 --> 18:59.596
I look forward to visiting
the leadership summit

18:59.696 --> 19:00.957
in Washington, D.C.,

19:01.057 --> 19:03.560
and learning valuable things
about civic, social,

19:03.660 --> 19:05.642
and business leadership skills.

19:05.742 --> 19:09.846
It's not about looking good
or uh...

19:09.946 --> 19:13.090
sounding good, I...I...

19:13.190 --> 19:14.811
I need to make sure that...

19:14.911 --> 19:16.413
<i>♪ He done dropped niggas ♪</i>

19:16.513 --> 19:18.735

19:28.645 --> 19:30.347
<i>- Or what?

19:30.447 --> 19:33.110
<i>You don't get to say "nigga."
None of y'all do.</i>

19:33.210 --> 19:34.431
<i>Oh, I'm pretty sure
I just said it.</i>

19:34.531 --> 19:35.712
<i>And I'm also pretty sure,
I don't know</i>

19:35.812 --> 19:37.234

- How about I show you</i>

19:37.334 --> 19:38.835

19:38.935 --> 19:40.277
<i>Okay, yo.
This is my cousin Will.</i>

19:40.377 --> 19:41.638
<i>Chill the fuck out, dude.</i>

19:41.738 --> 19:44.501
<i>Yo, you really gonna cosign
his bullshit?</i>

19:46.543 --> 19:48.545
Fuck.

19:52.749 --> 19:53.630
You know,
they really rolled out

19:53.630 --> 19:54.771
the red carpet, babe.

19:54.871 --> 19:57.254
And the package
they offered--mm--

19:57.354 --> 19:59.256
is a pretty sweet deal.

19:59.356 --> 20:01.538
Wow. I'm happy for you.

20:01.638 --> 20:02.899
I mean, am I happy that

20:02.999 --> 20:05.702
another woman has
my husband this worked up?

20:05.802 --> 20:09.146
Baby, baby, listen.

20:09.246 --> 20:12.989
There is only one woman
who gets me worked up,

20:13.089 --> 20:15.712
and you know
that will never change.

20:15.812 --> 20:17.314
Ever, ever.
- Wow.

20:17.414 --> 20:20.076
Haven't seen you this excited
in a long time.

20:20.176 --> 20:24.681
Yeah. Yeah, it feels good,
you know?

20:24.781 --> 20:26.963
To be wanted,

20:27.063 --> 20:30.607
valued for what you do.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.270
So you
seriously considering this?

20:36.152 --> 20:38.875
- I think I have to.
- Hmm.

20:42.198 --> 20:45.902
I'm not really one
who likes to...

20:46.002 --> 20:48.745
put myself out there.

20:48.845 --> 20:53.109
I prefer to let my art
speak for me.

20:53.209 --> 20:55.712
I mean, it's why I became
an artist in the first place,

20:55.812 --> 20:57.914
but lately.

20:58.014 --> 21:01.278
I've been feeling like
I'm suffocating in silence,

21:01.378 --> 21:06.182
which is what led me
to create this.

21:08.585 --> 21:10.807
I stepped out my comfort zone,

21:10.907 --> 21:13.730
but I was afraid to claim it
as my own,

21:13.830 --> 21:16.533
which, ironically,
is what it represents:

21:16.633 --> 21:19.616
being afraid, unheard, silenced.

21:19.716 --> 21:22.018
Why is it a battle

21:22.118 --> 21:25.302
to allow my voice to break
through the way I need it to?

21:25.402 --> 21:30.006
When it is my time to feel
valued and wanted?

21:52.869 --> 21:56.613
Well, just withdrew my name.

21:56.713 --> 21:57.974
You know, I don't need
a dumb award

21:58.074 --> 21:59.135
to get into an Ivy.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.978
Hell, my mom's a trustee
at Yale.

22:02.078 --> 22:04.180
That's the privileged spirit.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.343
Well, you might want
to direct

22:06.443 --> 22:08.385
some of that energy
to your cousin, bro.

22:08.485 --> 22:11.868
What the fuck
are you talking about?

22:11.968 --> 22:13.830
Who do you think
sent that video?

22:13.930 --> 22:15.071
The one person in it

22:15.171 --> 22:17.474
who comes out
looking like a hero.

22:17.574 --> 22:20.417
With you and me both benched,
that award's all his.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.608
Bro, I did not send
the video.

22:31.708 --> 22:33.049
I cannot even believe
you would accuse me of that.

22:33.149 --> 22:34.571
Oh, right.
So it's just convenient

22:34.671 --> 22:36.012
that you were dying up there

22:36.112 --> 22:38.735
and the video came out just
when you needed a lifeline.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.096
You know what your problem
is, Carlton?

22:40.196 --> 22:41.818
You always wanna blame somebody
when you fuck up.

22:41.918 --> 22:43.420
That's your problem.
- Hey, what is happening?

22:43.520 --> 22:44.981
Hey.

22:45.081 --> 22:49.185
You heard your mother.
Somebody better start speaking.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.268
Fine. This video came out
of me letting the guys

22:52.368 --> 22:53.750
on the lacrosse team
say the N-word,

22:53.850 --> 22:54.891
and now everyone thinks
I'm the villain.

22:54.891 --> 22:56.272
Whatever.
- Wait. What?

22:56.372 --> 22:57.554
And Carlton thinks
I leaked it.

22:57.654 --> 22:59.075
See? I told you

22:59.175 --> 23:00.877
all this competition
was gonna lead to a problem.

23:00.977 --> 23:03.520
Yes, it is a problem, because
I actually care about this,

23:03.620 --> 23:04.961
and Will showed up late
and unprepared.

23:05.061 --> 23:06.723
Because I had practice.

23:06.823 --> 23:08.124
Unlike you, I'm juggling
a real life.

23:08.224 --> 23:10.086
It's disrespectful
to everyone

23:10.186 --> 23:13.009
that actually cares about this
and takes it seriously.

23:13.109 --> 23:14.451
Will, you have a problem focusing.

23:14.551 --> 23:15.932
Dad, you said it yourself.
That's why

23:16.032 --> 23:17.414
you're helping him so much.
- What?

23:17.514 --> 23:18.815
So that's what you think.
- Hold up.

23:18.915 --> 23:20.777
That is not what I said.
I was talking more about

23:20.877 --> 23:22.258
your lack of commitment
and preparation.

23:22.358 --> 23:24.060
Okay, so because I don't do
things like you and Carlton,

23:24.160 --> 23:25.902
it's a problem.
- No, but I do think

23:26.002 --> 23:26.963
that you could be
more disciplined

23:26.963 --> 23:27.904
when it comes to your future.

23:28.004 --> 23:29.426
You would say that.

23:29.526 --> 23:30.867
He didn't even want me to keep
my name in the running.

23:30.967 --> 23:33.870
- No, it's not true.
- Yes. Yes, it's true.

23:33.970 --> 23:35.191
You said it was more
of Carlton's thing,

23:35.291 --> 23:37.153
but Doc told me
not to count myself out.

23:37.253 --> 23:39.115
- Doc?
- Yeah, Doc.

23:39.215 --> 23:42.118
At least he believes in me.

23:42.218 --> 23:44.441
After everything we've done
to support you,

23:44.541 --> 23:47.203
you can form your mouth
to even say those words?

23:47.303 --> 23:51.047
- Hey, Phil?
- No, no, Viv.

23:51.147 --> 23:53.730
Yeah, we'll see how much Doc
still believes in you

23:53.830 --> 23:58.615
when I stop putting money in
his bank account every month.

23:58.715 --> 24:01.217
You know what?

24:01.317 --> 24:03.099
It's cool.

24:03.199 --> 24:05.822
I'll just take care of myself.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.865
Always have.

24:08.965 --> 24:10.967
Got practice.

24:17.854 --> 24:19.556
A brother is starving.

24:19.656 --> 24:21.117
I'm about to order
the whole damn menu.

24:21.217 --> 24:23.760
Here you go.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.042
- Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

24:26.142 --> 24:27.404
So wait a minute.

24:27.504 --> 24:29.566
How did you know this was
my favourite restaurant?

24:29.666 --> 24:31.648
Come on now.

24:31.748 --> 24:33.009
It's me.

24:33.109 --> 24:34.811
Only the best for my baby.
Come on.

24:34.911 --> 24:36.973
Well, hold on. Hold on.

24:37.073 --> 24:38.415
I feel a toast coming on.
- Oh.

24:38.515 --> 24:40.577
Lift your glass.
Lift your glass.

24:42.238 --> 24:44.541
Hilary, I just wanna say
I'm proud of you.

24:44.641 --> 24:46.903
You know, congrats
on the Simply Spiked deal.

24:47.003 --> 24:48.625
I know how hard
you worked on it.

24:48.725 --> 24:51.828
You deserve the world,
and I wanna give it to you.

24:51.928 --> 24:54.791
Oh, and I'm gonna take it.

24:56.252 --> 24:58.254
Thank you, babe.
This is perfect.

25:02.819 --> 25:04.821
Fire.

25:07.383 --> 25:08.244
Whoo.

25:08.344 --> 25:09.766
Man, I see
what coach is doing.

25:09.866 --> 25:11.367
Spread the ball around,
get everybody involved,

25:11.467 --> 25:13.329
but this is my squad.
Dude, I'm the point guard.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.350
Like, put the ball in my hand
and make...

25:14.350 --> 25:16.172
- Damn, Bel-Air.
- Oh, wow.

25:16.272 --> 25:18.214
- This you?
- It's all me.

25:18.314 --> 25:20.336
- Man, this baby's sweet.
- Hey, back up off my car, man.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.018
Just imagine what type
of car he'd have

25:22.118 --> 25:23.580
if he got some playing time.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.423
He's funny.
You funny, man.

25:27.523 --> 25:29.065
- I do what I can.
- But trust me,

25:29.165 --> 25:30.266
I'm not gonna ride the bench
for long.

25:30.366 --> 25:33.229
- Yeah, we'll see.
- If I was pushing this...

25:33.329 --> 25:35.191
I'd have honeys up in here
every day.

25:35.291 --> 25:37.233
- I heard that.
- Yeah, you know my aunt

25:37.333 --> 25:38.835
got tired of me
taking her ride, so...

25:38.935 --> 25:42.879
Word. Well, yeah, we about
to grab a bite, hang a little.

25:42.979 --> 25:45.121
Wanna dip?

25:45.221 --> 25:46.883
Uh, yeah. That's cool.
I'll meet y'all there.

25:46.983 --> 25:49.726
Nah.
You driving, rook.

25:49.826 --> 25:51.928
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.249
Let me up in here.

25:53.349 --> 25:54.611
I guess the car's big enough
to fit your head.

25:54.711 --> 25:56.733
Oh, so you wanna be
chauffeured, huh?

25:56.833 --> 25:59.095
Hold on. You got a foot rest?

25:59.195 --> 26:00.176
Yeah, man.
When you back there,

26:00.276 --> 26:01.297
you can just relax,

26:01.397 --> 26:02.378
kick your feet up
on the ottoman,

26:02.478 --> 26:04.340
recline, get a little massage.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.223
Damn. Yo, we can watch
our games in here.

26:07.323 --> 26:10.386
Y'all can see how I just drop
the dub on them bums.

26:11.688 --> 26:13.690
- Let's drive, rook.
- Let's go, man.

26:36.432 --> 26:40.416
So I was thinking maybe
tomorrow, I could take you

26:40.516 --> 26:42.218
to one of my favourite
English pubs.

26:42.318 --> 26:43.620
It's not as good
as the ones back home,

26:43.720 --> 26:44.621
but at least they play

26:44.721 --> 26:45.982
premiership football.
You get me?

26:46.082 --> 26:48.464
Yeah, I'm starting to get
a bit knackered.

26:48.564 --> 26:50.947
Thinking about heading back.
- Jet lag tingles, yeah?

26:51.047 --> 26:52.669
- Mm-hmm.
- No problem.

26:52.769 --> 26:53.950
I can drop you back
to your hotel.

26:54.050 --> 26:57.073
Just tell me--
- No, back home.

26:57.173 --> 26:58.835
Gonna grab an early flight
back to London.

26:58.935 --> 27:00.557
I still got some Cs.

27:12.348 --> 27:15.812
Something wrong?

27:15.912 --> 27:17.774
I mean,

27:17.874 --> 27:20.857
you just got here.
- It's just--it's weird to me

27:20.957 --> 27:23.499
that you're very important
to a lot of people,

27:23.599 --> 27:25.141
to these people.

27:25.241 --> 27:27.664
All the stories
and the history.

27:27.764 --> 27:30.827
It's like they can't seem
to get on without you.

27:30.927 --> 27:33.670
But I did...

27:33.770 --> 27:38.234
for years.

27:38.334 --> 27:42.719
I told you my reasons.

27:42.819 --> 27:45.141
That doesn't make it
hurt any less.

27:51.948 --> 27:54.130
Frederick, please.

27:54.230 --> 27:56.012
Come on, man.
We've waited too many years

27:56.112 --> 27:57.533
for this to end
in a bad memory.

27:57.633 --> 27:59.335
Well, then let's go out
on a high note, yeah?

27:59.435 --> 28:03.019
I'm doing fine
and you're doing fine, right?

28:03.119 --> 28:07.864
Look, I don't hate you.
I don't.

28:07.964 --> 28:10.406
I just don't know you.

28:14.010 --> 28:16.012
Maybe we leave it at that.

28:27.984 --> 28:29.205
So we got fries,
we got sodas,

28:29.305 --> 28:30.486
we got four types of wings.

28:30.586 --> 28:32.208
I'm talking about buffalo,
lemon pepper,

28:32.308 --> 28:34.530
honey, barbecue, and Cajun.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.212
- Hey, thanks, man.
- It's all good.

28:36.312 --> 28:38.014
- How much I owe you?
- Ah, it's my treat.

28:38.114 --> 28:39.095
Hell, yeah.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.217
So what school
you looking at next year?

28:41.317 --> 28:43.379
I got a scholarship to UCLA.

28:43.479 --> 28:44.741
I already signed
my letter of intent.

28:44.841 --> 28:45.902
That's what's up, bro. Congrats.

28:46.002 --> 28:49.625
- Thanks, bro.
- That's crazy.

28:49.725 --> 28:51.347
I got to make
this pro shit pop.

28:51.447 --> 28:52.909
Buy a real crib.

28:53.009 --> 28:56.552
Look after my sister,
my grandma.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.515
Change the game.

28:59.615 --> 29:01.077
You know what I'm saying?

29:01.177 --> 29:01.998
Damn good.

29:02.098 --> 29:03.760
I'm trying to do
the same thing.

29:03.860 --> 29:05.682
Take care of my mom.
Make my own way.

29:05.782 --> 29:08.244
Man, you already made it.
Livin' in Bel-Air.

29:10.266 --> 29:11.768
Bro, that's my aunt
and uncle's house.

29:11.868 --> 29:13.690
I'm telling you,
I'm really from Philly.

29:13.790 --> 29:14.891
- Word.
- Yeah.

29:14.991 --> 29:16.172
- Respect.
- Born and raised, man.

29:16.272 --> 29:18.695
What, y'all over here
on a date or something?

29:18.795 --> 29:21.497
What's up, Jackie?

29:21.597 --> 29:23.860
Mm.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.943
Damn, girl.
Hey, you good?

29:27.043 --> 29:29.625
Not as good
as I'm about to be.

29:29.725 --> 29:31.908
You partying with me tonight
or what?

29:32.008 --> 29:33.029
Yeah, I'm just--I'm kind of

29:33.129 --> 29:34.230
in the middle of something
right now.

29:34.330 --> 29:37.073
Hey, Jackie, why don't you
come sit with us?

29:37.173 --> 29:40.076
- Yeah, come sit with us.
- Nah.

29:40.176 --> 29:44.600
I know when a dude's trying
to blow me off.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.003
Fuck you, Bel-Air.

29:50.346 --> 29:51.527
What?

29:55.151 --> 29:58.294
It's all you, bro.

29:58.394 --> 30:00.556
What the fuck just happened?

30:02.398 --> 30:04.540
Congratulations.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.983
Your motherly superpowers
are spot on.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.145
- What are you talking about?
- You called it.

30:09.245 --> 30:10.827
You knew that competition
between me and Will

30:10.927 --> 30:12.708
was gonna end badly,
and here we are.

30:12.808 --> 30:15.832
Oh, I can't say I enjoy
being right this time.

30:15.932 --> 30:17.433
It doesn't even matter, right?

30:17.533 --> 30:18.995
Because this gonna be
over soon.

30:19.095 --> 30:20.877
Right, there's no coming back
from this.

30:20.977 --> 30:23.880
Does dropping out need to be
the only solution?

30:23.980 --> 30:26.242
When they're saying
I'm an Uncle Tom,

30:26.342 --> 30:29.445
a sellout,
and, my personal favourite,

30:29.545 --> 30:32.208
Yeezus reincarnated,

30:32.308 --> 30:35.131
yeah, I think it's a wrap.

30:35.231 --> 30:38.494
Apparently, I just can't get
away from being that kid.

30:38.594 --> 30:40.416
You know what I see?

30:40.516 --> 30:42.178
That kid who is so bold

30:42.278 --> 30:44.901
to be in any space
that he isn't welcome

30:45.001 --> 30:47.263
and who's just trying
to fit in.

30:47.363 --> 30:50.186
I was trying to be
someone different.

30:50.286 --> 30:52.388
All right, the BSU,
the protest,

30:52.488 --> 30:56.352
the Founder's Award.

30:56.452 --> 30:58.714
Yazmin.

30:58.814 --> 31:02.358
All people see are my mistakes.

31:02.458 --> 31:03.880
That's high school,

31:03.980 --> 31:06.682
and it is par for the course.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.564
I made plenty of mistakes.

31:08.664 --> 31:10.246
The only difference is,

31:10.346 --> 31:13.689
it wasn't being recorded
on somebody's phone.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.573
Evolving--it never stops.

31:17.673 --> 31:21.577
I mean, I am still
on my own journey,

31:21.677 --> 31:25.021
even at this age.
- What? Even at 32?

31:25.121 --> 31:28.344
Mm-hmm. Even at 32, I am
still learning new tricks.

31:28.444 --> 31:32.708
Did you know that I have been
posting on social media?

31:32.808 --> 31:34.430
- Wait. You?
- Mm-hmm.

31:34.530 --> 31:39.075
Right, but what I've learned,
more than anything else,

31:39.175 --> 31:43.840
is that, whatever
we're going through,

31:43.940 --> 31:48.784
there is someone else
who's feeling the same way.

32:10.726 --> 32:12.348
Jackie, Jackie.
- Hmm?

32:12.448 --> 32:15.271
Going kind of hard
for a school night, aren't you?

32:15.371 --> 32:17.833
Been that kind of week.

32:17.933 --> 32:19.795
Right.
Well, look, I'm not trippin'.

32:19.895 --> 32:21.958
I'm just saying,
you might want to slow down.

32:22.058 --> 32:24.600
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

32:24.700 --> 32:28.004
Damn. Be careful, bitch.

32:28.104 --> 32:30.046
Bitch?

32:30.146 --> 32:33.169
Funny, I didn't catch
your mama anywhere.

32:34.710 --> 32:36.252
What did this girl
just say to me?

32:36.352 --> 32:38.174
Oh, you're mad?

32:38.274 --> 32:39.855
Girl, what's up?

32:39.955 --> 32:41.337
What's up with it?
No, no, let's go.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.259
- Yeah, that's cute shit.
- Just be cool, Shay.

32:43.359 --> 32:45.701
- Relax, relax.
- Let go of me.

32:45.801 --> 32:47.623
Relax, Jackie.

32:47.723 --> 32:50.106
Okay, I'm not your enemy.

32:50.206 --> 32:52.728

33:05.501 --> 33:07.163
But yo, don't mention
our name to Doc

33:07.263 --> 33:09.165
when you explain it to him.
- Wait, Doc?

33:09.265 --> 33:11.487
- Yeah, she lives with him.
- No.

33:11.587 --> 33:13.930
You didn't know?

33:14.030 --> 33:17.773
Good luck, bro.

33:17.873 --> 33:19.735
Peace.

33:19.835 --> 33:23.739

Today was everything, babe.

33:36.452 --> 33:40.436
And I missed you.

33:40.536 --> 33:41.837
I missed you too.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.320
And I was thinking
maybe we could,

33:44.420 --> 33:46.422
you know, go back
to the way things were.

33:48.784 --> 33:50.766
I'm so sorry.

33:50.866 --> 33:52.368
Sir, do you happen to have
another card?

33:52.468 --> 33:54.810
This one's been declined.
- That's not even possible.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.372
I just put money
in the account this morning.

33:56.472 --> 33:58.934
It's not declined.
Can you just try one more time?

33:59.034 --> 34:01.337
Do you have another card
you'd like to try?

34:01.437 --> 34:03.259
No, I don't have another
card I would like to try.

34:03.359 --> 34:05.061
This is the card.

34:05.161 --> 34:06.983
You know what?
Babe, maybe the deposit

34:07.083 --> 34:08.704
just hasn't cleared yet.
- No.

34:08.804 --> 34:11.147
The money is in there, babe.
I saw it.

34:11.247 --> 34:13.109
Let her just run it

34:13.209 --> 34:14.870
I'm sure everything's fine.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.632
Actually, I got it.
- No, you don't.

34:16.732 --> 34:17.793
- No, I do.
- I got it.

34:17.893 --> 34:20.116
Can you just take this?
Please. Thank you.

34:20.216 --> 34:22.218

34:22.978 --> 34:24.080

- Yes, please.

34:37.953 --> 34:40.536
Hey, one step.
All right, you got it.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.102
- You're in trouble.
- Shh.

34:46.202 --> 34:47.903
- You're gonna get it.
- Stop. Stop.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.785
Stop.

34:49.885 --> 34:51.907
- Jackie, come here.
- Mm.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.430
God, don't let this man
kill me.

34:54.530 --> 34:56.892
I like your chain.

34:58.454 --> 35:00.276
Oh.

35:00.376 --> 35:02.918
- Come on, baby.
- I...okay.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.561
Bye. Bye. Bye, Will.

35:05.661 --> 35:07.963
- Hang tight for a second.
- I just wanna go to sleep.

35:08.063 --> 35:11.487
You will.

35:11.587 --> 35:14.510
Shit.

35:26.842 --> 35:28.844
She's asleep.

35:35.291 --> 35:38.474
I appreciate you looking out.

35:38.574 --> 35:41.677
Yeah, of course.

35:41.777 --> 35:43.239
Yeah, Jackie's strong, man,

35:43.339 --> 35:46.562
but she got her demons, too,
you know?

35:46.662 --> 35:50.446
Yeah, I ain't never seen
that side of her.

35:50.546 --> 35:54.410
My little sister had her
when she was in high school.

35:54.510 --> 35:59.054
Pretty much
raised Jackie myself.

35:59.154 --> 36:01.056
I'm trying to make sure
she doesn't have to pay

36:01.156 --> 36:03.339
for her mom's mistakes.

36:03.439 --> 36:05.501
Well, hey,

36:05.601 --> 36:09.265
it's pretty dope
that you stepped up like that.

36:09.365 --> 36:12.828
We family.
It's what we do.

36:16.292 --> 36:18.994
You know, I would be

36:19.094 --> 36:21.957
in a cell or

36:22.057 --> 36:24.760
in a casket if it wasn't
for my uncle.

36:26.342 --> 36:28.684
Just wish he would stop
trying to control my shit.

36:28.784 --> 36:31.287
You feel me?
- Yeah, man.

36:31.387 --> 36:32.808
He's from
a whole different world

36:32.908 --> 36:33.849
than what we used to.

36:33.949 --> 36:36.071
That's what I'm saying.

36:40.396 --> 36:43.319
So he got you out of some
kind of trouble back in Philly?

36:45.801 --> 36:50.426
Yo, it's cool if you don't want
to talk about it.

36:50.526 --> 36:52.708
No.

36:52.808 --> 36:56.392
It's cool.

36:56.492 --> 36:58.554
I trust you.

36:58.654 --> 37:00.656
I got you.

37:08.424 --> 37:10.926
Hey.

37:11.026 --> 37:13.048
Car should be here any minute.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.011
Thanks again
for the hospitality, Mr. Banks.

37:16.111 --> 37:20.055
You know, Geoffrey
isn't just a good man.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.058
He's extraordinary.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.581
So I've heard.

37:25.681 --> 37:26.862
And I know
your mother and your father,

37:26.962 --> 37:30.266
your adopted family,
they took good care of you.

37:30.366 --> 37:32.348
It's the only family
I've ever known.

37:32.448 --> 37:35.431
You grew up in
a two-bedroom flat in Brixton.

37:35.531 --> 37:37.072
You ever wonder
how they could afford

37:37.172 --> 37:40.155
your private education
at Dulwich?

37:40.255 --> 37:42.998
Or those British street gangs
you tried to run with

37:43.098 --> 37:45.140
and they turned you away.

37:47.823 --> 37:52.067
The GAS, MZ, and 150.

37:54.830 --> 37:57.573
They wanted no part of me.

37:57.673 --> 38:00.336
Or that time when your dad
was on disability

38:00.436 --> 38:02.778
and your mother lost
her receptionist job.

38:02.878 --> 38:05.301
And the both of them was
out of work for a full year.

38:05.401 --> 38:08.063
But you, your siblings,

38:08.163 --> 38:10.105
a meal was never missed.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.187
Groceries were always
on the table.

38:12.287 --> 38:14.950
Heat and lights on.

38:15.050 --> 38:16.312
Geoffrey?

38:16.412 --> 38:19.235
He's always been
in your life...

38:19.335 --> 38:23.799
even when he couldn't be.

38:23.899 --> 38:26.161
I know this is something that
you're gonna have to process

38:26.261 --> 38:30.165
on your own,
and I respect that, but...

38:30.265 --> 38:31.447
I just couldn't let you
leave here

38:31.547 --> 38:34.430
without knowing
who your father really is.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.082

40:29.264 --> 40:30.446
that doesn't even matter to me.

but come on.
