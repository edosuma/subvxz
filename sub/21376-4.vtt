- What's up?
Thank you. Thank you.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.108
Welcome to "Hood Adjacent."
I'm your host, James Davis.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.111
This is a nice crowd.
Y'all dressed to the T.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.863
I see a little
white girl table over there,

00:29.946 --> 00:31.281
business class.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.117
[laughter]

00:34.200 --> 00:36.828
Now, I want to say what's up
to the people at home,

00:36.911 --> 00:38.955
the people watching this
on they phone,

00:39.038 --> 00:39.998
and, of course, the Feds.
You know they watching.

00:40.081 --> 00:43.418
Or--or should I say,
"listening in"?

00:43.501 --> 00:45.128
Y'all have seen "The Wire."

00:45.211 --> 00:47.255
Or the Trump administration.

00:47.338 --> 00:47.797
They're recording
our every move.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.215
Stay woke, y'all.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.551
But you know who else
is always watching?

00:51.634 --> 00:53.636
Black Twitter.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.721
[laughter and applause]

00:54.804 --> 00:56.306
Yeah.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.726
They watching me right now,
judging me,

00:59.809 --> 01:02.020
trying to decide if
I'm doing it for the culture

01:02.103 --> 01:02.937
or ruining the culture.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.482
Well, guess what, Black Twitter?

01:05.565 --> 01:07.358
I ain't afraid of you.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.985
In fact, this whole episode

01:09.068 --> 01:11.821
is all about Black Twitter.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.615
This corner of Twitter

01:13.698 --> 01:16.576
is like all-star weekend
on your timeline.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.579
Hoes, hustlers, comedians.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.414
It's the only place
where Nicki Minaj

01:21.498 --> 01:25.126
and Remy Ma will still
show up at the same time.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.504
Now, if you don't know
what Black Twitter is,

01:27.587 --> 01:29.631
there's a very simple
explanation.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.342
You ain't got no black friends.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.760
Black lives matter,
just not online.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.346
Well, tonight, follow me,

01:36.429 --> 01:37.847
as we explore the safest place
for black people

01:37.931 --> 01:40.683
since Africa in the 1500s.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.560
And I don't even know
anything about

01:42.644 --> 01:44.312
Africa in the 1500s.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.022
But it has to be better
than what happened afterwards.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.191
#Slavery.
#12YearsOf.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.484
I don't know why I pointed
to the white people.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.528
Uh...
[laughter]

01:51.611 --> 01:52.695
That was an accident.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.449
[laughter and applause]

01:56.533 --> 01:59.035
I love you.
I love you.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.120
You didn't do that.
It wasn't you guys.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.705
It was just your
great-great-great-great--

02:02.789 --> 02:05.959
[laughter]

02:08.419 --> 02:10.420
And I know that.
Not judging you.

02:10.505 --> 02:14.801
But Black Twitter is
a 24-hour nonstop dialogue.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.719
You might watch CNN

02:16.803 --> 02:18.471
or MSNBC.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.516
But Black Twitter is our
Black-NN,

02:21.599 --> 02:24.143
our Black-Ass NBC.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.104
A place where honesty is a key.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.438
And if you get caught slipping,

02:27.522 --> 02:29.774
lying, or hairline receding,

02:29.858 --> 02:31.693
you're gonna get dragged.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.777
Ain't that right?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.445
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

02:34.529 --> 02:36.072
- Now, here's one of
my favorite moments

02:36.155 --> 02:37.782
from Black Twitter.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.452
It's when Yahoo
accidentally tweeted this.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.372
"Trump wants
a much nigger navy.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.125
Here's how much it would cost."

02:47.208 --> 02:48.501
That's right, North Korea.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.210
We ain't worried
about them nukes.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.587
We got the nigga navy.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.131
[laughter]

02:53.214 --> 02:56.134
Never should have
gave you niggas Wi-Fi.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.594
This is my favorite one.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.846
{\an8}It's a "Nigga Navy Seal,"
get it?

02:59.929 --> 03:03.141
{\an8}[laughter and applause]

03:04.517 --> 03:05.935
{\an8}That's why--that's why
his face looks like that,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.605
{\an8}<i>'cause he been in war.</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:09.814
{\an8}<i>In the nigga navy.</i>

03:09.898 --> 03:11.441
{\an8}<i>That's war scars.</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:14.152
{\an8}Don't "aw" him.
He's a patriot.

03:14.235 --> 03:18.239
{\an8}Black Twitter has become
a cultural force,

03:18.323 --> 03:21.200
{\an8}propelling national movements
like Black Lives Matter;

03:21.284 --> 03:23.036
{\an8}Hands Up, Don't Shoot;

03:23.119 --> 03:25.663
{\an8}LaVar Ball, sit down.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.458
Memes are the engine
that drive Black Twitter.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.336
This next meme is like
"In Living Color" in the '90s.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.755
There's not a black person
who hasn't seen it.

03:33.838 --> 03:34.756
Look at that dude.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.300
<i>[laughter]</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:39.177
<i>That's actually</i>
<i>a black former congressman</i>

03:39.260 --> 03:41.304
<i>who showed up</i>
<i>to defend the cop</i>

03:41.387 --> 03:45.475
<i>who shot Mike Brown,</i>
<i>so [BLEEP] him.</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:46.726
Memes, they have a lot of power.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.771
But do they have the power
to resurrect a career?

03:49.854 --> 03:51.481
Remember this dude,
Shawn Harrison?

03:51.564 --> 03:55.485
AKA Waldo Geraldo Faldo.
Remember him?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.195
- 'Cause there's only one Waldo.

03:57.278 --> 03:57.987
- That's true.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.990
No, there's another Waldo,

04:01.074 --> 04:01.866
but people can't
seem to find him.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.661
[studio laughter]

04:04.744 --> 04:06.788
- Now, Waldo was
Eddie's dumb best friend,

04:06.871 --> 04:08.331
who as soon as
Urkel started to blow up,

04:08.414 --> 04:10.208
producers were like,

04:10.291 --> 04:11.000
"We need a new black dude
to annoy the Winslows."

04:11.084 --> 04:13.962
Boom.
Waldo showed up.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.673
Well, we decided to use
some of our meme power

04:16.755 --> 04:18.091
to lend Shawn a hand.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.091
And this is how we did it.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.011
{\an8}Shawn Harrison.
- Yeah, man.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.388
{\an8}- AKA Waldo Geraldo Faldo.
- Yes, sir.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.931
{\an8}- What you been up to
since we fell in love

04:25.014 --> 04:26.849
{\an8}with you on "Family Matters"?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.351
- Uh, graduated from UCLA.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.103
Got a BA in Psychology.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.521
Uh, recurred on "Girlfriends"...
- Okay.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.855
- For a couple seasons.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.607
And, uh, did some animated work.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.733
{\an1}- Now, Shawn, is this where
you saw yourself in 2017?

04:35.817 --> 04:36.859
- Oh, hell no.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.236
<i>- Shawn was thinking</i>

04:38.319 --> 04:41.197
<i>more along the lines of this.</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:41.906
I know things are slow.
- Yeah.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.367
- But me and Black Twitter,

04:44.450 --> 04:45.743
we gonna blow you up.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.661
- Really?
- Just watch.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.454
Come on, man.
- All right.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.706
- We're gonna meme you up,

I'm the Scorsese.

- Yeah.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.630
- Okay.
- "Titanic."

05:02.176 --> 05:03.761
[camera shutters clicks]

05:03.845 --> 05:07.056

the "Family Matters" movie.

<i>But your character</i>
<i>dies in the first scene.</i>

You a black man.
Boom.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.647
You're watching Fox News

05:14.731 --> 05:16.983

<i>And you want to be</i>
<i>out in the club</i>

"Forensic Files."

05:31.330 --> 05:32.373
Waiting on you.
- Look, what had happened--

05:32.457 --> 05:34.542
- I ain't even
got no engagement ring.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.918
That was good.
That was good.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.336
<i>We had our building blocks.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:39.672
<i>All we had to do</i>
<i>was mold this clay</i>

05:39.756 --> 05:41.215
<i>into a fire-ass meme.</i>

05:41.299 --> 05:44.093
<i>I sent the photos to some of</i>
<i>my homeys on Black Twitter,</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:45.511
<i>and told them to start</i>
<i>pushing my product</i>

<i>so we could get Waldo poppin'.</i>

05:48.431 --> 05:50.099
[cheers and applause]

05:50.183 --> 05:52.268
All right, all right, all right.
Look at this one.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.269
"When you were just
hatin' on the weed,

05:53.352 --> 05:54.562
but now you high as hell."

05:54.645 --> 05:55.938
Look at his face.

05:56.022 --> 05:56.856
"When she say you
got a big dick,

05:56.939 --> 05:58.024
but you know you don't."

05:58.107 --> 05:58.983
Look at--look at his face.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.234
"When you catch your mom

- Okay, okay.

06:27.053 --> 06:27.804
Oh, more show?
More show?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.138
All right.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.556
And we're black.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.975
[laughter]

06:33.059 --> 06:35.186
One of the things
you'll find on Black Twitter

06:35.269 --> 06:39.315
are the stans, or the super fans
of prominent black artists.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.317
Nicki Minaj has her Barbz.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.236
Drake has his OVO stans.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.821
And DMX has
his probation officer.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.656
[laughter]

06:46.739 --> 06:48.032
But no group is as big

06:48.116 --> 06:51.494
or as powerful

06:51.577 --> 06:53.079
as the Beyhive, right?

06:53.162 --> 06:55.706
[cheers and applause]

06:55.790 --> 06:57.834
This pack of rabid Beyoncé fans

06:57.917 --> 07:00.169
will do anything
in the name of their queen,

07:00.253 --> 07:04.006
and their tweets
come fast and furious.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.883
They've made death threats

07:05.967 --> 07:08.010
to Fox News host
and former black woman

07:08.094 --> 07:09.262
Stacey Dash.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.097
[laughter and applause]

07:11.180 --> 07:15.351
Because she insulted
Beyoncé's mother.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.019
Now, when Beyoncé
alluded to the fact

07:17.103 --> 07:18.896
that Jay-Z cheated on her
with the lyric

07:18.980 --> 07:20.398
"Better call
Becky with the good hair"...

07:20.481 --> 07:23.943
[scoffs]
The Beyhive, they swarmed.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.320
And they had their victim
when Rachel Roy,

07:26.404 --> 07:28.781
a fashion designer
linked to Jay-Z,

07:28.865 --> 07:30.992
posted a photo with the caption:

07:31.075 --> 07:32.451
"Good hair don't care."

07:32.535 --> 07:34.287
<i>[crowd groans]</i>
<i>Ooh, petty.</i>

07:34.370 --> 07:35.538
<i>But instead of</i>
<i>attacking Rachel Roy,</i>

07:35.621 --> 07:39.333
they went after
celebrity chef Rachel Ray.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.252
<i>[laughter]</i>

07:41.335 --> 07:44.005
<i>And shredded her to pieces.</i>

07:44.088 --> 07:44.839
[scattered cheers, laughter]

07:44.922 --> 07:46.549
Turns out

07:46.632 --> 07:48.217
the Beyhive's biggest enemies

07:48.301 --> 07:50.845
are vowels

07:50.928 --> 07:52.889
and common human decency.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.766
Now, I found a few members
of the hive

07:55.850 --> 07:58.144
who were willing
to put their trolling on hold

07:58.227 --> 07:59.395
to talk to me.

07:59.478 --> 08:02.273
{\an8}<i>This is Jessica, Bert, and Sham.</i>

08:02.356 --> 08:04.233
{\an8}<i>They're a colony of the Beyhive.</i>

08:04.317 --> 08:06.027
{\an8}<i>And they ride or die</i>
<i>for the Queen Bey.</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:07.737
{\an8}<i>Ya heard?</i>

08:07.820 --> 08:08.905
{\an3}- If you come to me
with the Beyoncé hate,

08:08.988 --> 08:10.615
{\an3}then we gotta set you straight,
that's it.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.201
{\an1}- Sometimes you gotta--
pop 'em real quick.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.244
- Pop 'em, and put 'em
right back in they place.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.997
{\an3}- It's a revolution.
The Beyhive is a revolution.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.665
- Let's talk about
some tweets then.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.082
{\an8}- Oh.
- Can we?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.043
{\an8}- Uh-oh.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.419
{\an7}- "When people
talk shit about Bey,

08:23.502 --> 08:25.671
{\an7}"my knee-jerk reaction
is to say something

08:25.755 --> 08:27.423
{\an7}about their face
and their mother."

08:27.506 --> 08:29.383
Come on--they mama...
- Yes, you don't--

08:29.467 --> 08:31.594
you can't talk about
people's mamas, I understand.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.931
But I said, it's because
I was raised correctly.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.183
So your mama raised you,

08:37.265 --> 08:39.059
and you have something
to say about Beyoncé.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.686
{\an1}- Oh.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.438
- So I just gotta
question the relationship.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.273
Did y'all have a...
- Bert, you tweeted.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.235
{\an8}"Katy Perry..."
- [laughs]

08:47.318 --> 08:50.613
{\an8}- "You racist crack whore.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.449
{\an7}Talk about Beyoncé again and
it'll be your cotton candy wig."

08:53.533 --> 08:56.327
{\an1}- Listen, we gotta,
you know, keep it direct.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.121
{\an1}- What was this tweet
in response to?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.456
- You know what?

09:00.539 --> 09:01.999
{\an1}At this point,
that was so long ago.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.584
I'm pretty sure
she deserved it

09:03.668 --> 09:04.877
whenever I tweeted it.

09:04.961 --> 09:05.795
- So, Bert, you don't regret

09:05.878 --> 09:08.256
{\an1}calling her
a racist crack whore?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.341
You just don't remember why you
called her a racist crack whore?

09:10.424 --> 09:12.468
{\an1}- I mean,
the girl is problematic.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.804
{\an3}- I'm sure he was justified
in saying what he said--

09:14.887 --> 09:16.430
- I very much so was.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.057
{\an1}- You're proud of it,
aren't you?

09:18.140 --> 09:19.767
{\an1}- I mean, hey, that's,
you know, something

09:19.850 --> 09:21.060
{\an1}that you can put
on your résumé, right?

09:21.143 --> 09:23.688
<i>- Many of the Beyhive victims</i>
<i>are well known.</i>

09:23.771 --> 09:25.314
- Keyshia Cole.
- Alicia Keys.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.774
- Missy Elliott.
- Karrueche.

09:26.857 --> 09:27.858
- Wendy Williams.
- Rachel Ray.

09:27.942 --> 09:28.317
- Jody Watley.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.360
- What?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.821
{\an1}- Jody needed a popping,
you know.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.531
- Anybody can get it.
- Wow.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.491
<i>But it's the deeper cuts</i>

09:35.574 --> 09:37.159
<i>that let you know</i>
<i>they ain't messing around.</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:40.079
- The Grammys are just,
you know, flagrant.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.831
{\an1}- Anybody specific
at The Grammys?

09:41.914 --> 09:43.916
- The president of the
whole situation, Neil Portnow.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.962
I want to get his phone number,
his email, all of that.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.130
We need to get to him,
'cause I need some explanation.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.923
- We need some answers.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.093
{\an3}- We talking about the
self-titled Beyoncé album,

09:54.176 --> 09:56.345
{\an3}which changed
the whole industry.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.514
And she lost to Beck.
- To Beck.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.349
{\an3}- We don't know a song
off that album.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.101
{\an3}Then once again,
"Lemonade" comes out.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.686
{\an1}- The most critically
acclaimed album of 2016.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.523
{\an3}- I mean,
who on Metacritic gets a 90...

10:07.606 --> 10:08.816
- Two.
- 92?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.693
I mean, come on.
- A black woman.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.986
- It was album of the year,

10:12.069 --> 10:13.154
and she lost to Adele.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.530
{\an3}Which her last album
sounded like the first two

10:14.613 --> 10:17.074
that she already put--
- Damn.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.327
This is Queen Bey here.
- Yes.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.953
- Would you commit a crime?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.204
- Other than piracy?
- Mm.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.540
- "Other than piracy"?

10:24.623 --> 10:26.042
{\an1}- Let's say, like,
Keri Hilson release a song.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.502
{\an1}She talk shit about Beyoncé,
so we blasting

10:28.586 --> 10:30.546
the link all over Twitter.
- Right.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.673
- You provide links...
- Yeah.

10:32.757 --> 10:36.385
{\an1}- For people to illegally
download other artists' songs?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.845
- You don't have to pay for
this Keri Hilson album.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.305
You can buy "Lemonade."

10:39.388 --> 10:40.806
{\an1}- Do you regret
anything you've done

10:40.890 --> 10:41.432
in the name of Beyoncé?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.934
- Definitely not.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.479
I never regret anything I do--

10:46.562 --> 10:48.272
just to protect the queen.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.191
{\an1}- What we said was justified,
you know?

10:50.274 --> 10:53.444
{\an1}Don't come for
the head black artist in charge.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.321
Like, you know.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.324
It's just not okay, so.
- I can't say I regret anything.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.659
{\an1}- Well, guys, thank you so much
for being so candid with me.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.661
And I'm happy to tell you

11:02.745 --> 11:04.413
{\an1}that I have a special guest
for you to meet.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.248
- What?
- Beyoncé?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.209
- Don't tell me Big B
finna walk up in here.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.252
- Just stay here.
- Don't mess with us.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.462
- James.
Who is it?

11:11.545 --> 11:13.172
- I can't move myself.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.049
<i>- All right,</i>
<i>I didn't have Beyoncé.</i>

11:15.132 --> 11:18.344
{\an8}<i>But I did have</i>
<i>my childhood friend Ajay.</i>

11:18.427 --> 11:19.428
- Aw.
- You wrong for that.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.138
- You bully people online

11:21.222 --> 11:22.098
and help people steal music.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.600
That's illegal.
So guess what?

11:24.683 --> 11:26.769
Your punishment is not
gonna be meeting your idol.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.729
And I don't know Beyoncé anyway.

This humor is about

<i>he's happy, he's confident.</i>

<i>But from the nose--them eyes?</i>

14:18.774 --> 14:20.109
<i>It's like "Stranger Things."</i>

14:20.192 --> 14:21.777
It's like he's--
he's terrified.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.654
He's seen the boogeyman.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.364
Which is his main piece.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.032
This ain't even meme.
This is documentary.

That's really his life.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.431

<i>Bomani Jones,</i>

side chick, side dude humor

15:07.364 --> 15:08.991
that is so enticing?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.868
- Nothing is funnier
than a bad idea, man.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.495
All right?
Like, these--these stories

15:13.579 --> 15:14.663
do not ever end positively.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.291
They tend to always end in ruin.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.917
- Black folks love drama.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.628
And we love comedy.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.503
{\an1}And so any time
that there's errors,

15:21.587 --> 15:23.839
there's gonna be comedy.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.049
{\an3}- I'm pretty sure I've
been a--a side dude.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.801
- You didn't know though?
- It wasn't confirmed.

15:27.885 --> 15:28.719
{\an3}But you get a feeling
in your heart.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.054
- In your gut.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.347
- I ain't
never had no side chick.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.389
I ain't ever been a side dude...

15:32.473 --> 15:34.099
- All right.
- To my--to my knowledge.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.309
{\an1}- I dated rappers,
so the odds

15:35.392 --> 15:37.269
{\an1}of me being a side chick
at some point are very high.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.023
{\an3}- Why are jokes about
side chicks and side dudes

15:41.106 --> 15:43.817
{\an3}more popular in
the black community

15:43.901 --> 15:45.319
than in other communities?

15:45.402 --> 15:48.030
{\an1}- Our ability to
always take everything

15:48.113 --> 15:48.989
{\an1}and turn it into positive
is something that

15:49.073 --> 15:51.408
{\an1}black folks have been
forced to do,

15:51.492 --> 15:53.369
{\an1}and so it's just one of
the next things that we do.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.746
- What's she's saying is that
Black Twitter is gumbo, right?

15:55.829 --> 15:57.206
- Mmm, yes.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.248
{\an3}- And the scraps
are the things that

15:58.332 --> 16:00.459
{\an3}maybe the mainstream
doesn't deal with,

16:00.542 --> 16:01.502
like side chick humor.
- Yes.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.795
{\an3}- But we done thrown that
in the roux.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.130
And we over here
feasting on some.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.757
- We cooking.
- And we cooking.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.509
{\an1}- I think it's more taboo
to white people.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.260
{\an1}'Cause we know
white people get down.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.680
{\an1}A white--like a white dude
have a side chick,

16:12.763 --> 16:15.224
{\an1}and plan to kill his whole
family so he can be with her.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.809
{\an3}- On Black Twitter, it's really
about the side chick.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.560
{\an1}- Yes.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.728
{\an3}- Now, is that a misogynist
kind of situation?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.897
{\an1}- Yes.
I think it's misogynistic

16:21.980 --> 16:24.191
{\an1}because it never
ends up being about

16:24.274 --> 16:26.193
{\an1}the fact that you shouldn't
have a side chick

16:26.276 --> 16:27.027
in the first place.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.238
- The side chick is practice.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.156
How am I gonna know
how to treat you and

16:31.240 --> 16:33.242
what nice places to take you...
- [laughs]

16:33.325 --> 16:34.910
- If I--I can't
be in a relationship

16:34.993 --> 16:35.661
just freestyling, Amanda.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.622
My girl Amanda like seafood.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.457
Me and my side chick
need to come here

16:40.541 --> 16:42.126
on a Thursday afternoon and
see what Stevie's talking about.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.254
I'm not about to bring
my baby to Stevie's

16:45.337 --> 16:47.464
and the gumbo
not the way she like it.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.341
{\an1}- You listening to a [BLEEP]
with sunglasses on inside.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.467
- Okay--[laughs]

16:50.551 --> 16:52.678
<i>But that [BLEEP]</i>
<i>with the sunglasses</i>

16:52.761 --> 16:54.263
<i>is something like</i>
<i>a Black Twitter pioneer.</i>

16:54.346 --> 16:56.765
- So I made this meme that says

16:56.849 --> 16:59.351
{\an1}"I might not be
the man crush Monday,

16:59.435 --> 17:01.270
{\an8}<i>but I smashed on</i>
<i>side [BLEEP] Sunday."</i>

17:01.353 --> 17:03.856
<i>- You may talk about side chicks</i>
<i>Monday through Saturday,</i>

17:03.939 --> 17:06.608
<i>but thanks to Karlous,</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:08.609
<i>Sunday is the day</i>
<i>to appreciate the side dude.</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:10.529
{\an3}Are these memes--
is this humor

17:10.612 --> 17:13.949
{\an3}normalizing adultery
within our generation?

17:14.031 --> 17:15.451
- Of course, it normalizes it.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.077
- It ain't normalizing it.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.121
It's what it's been
forever and ever and...

17:19.204 --> 17:21.290
{\an1}- But it used to
have shame attached to it.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.624
And now it don't.
- Ahh, mm.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.252
- Yeah, but Bill--Bill Clinton
almost got impeached,

17:25.335 --> 17:26.795
but we knew how Bill Clinton got
down a long time before that.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.381
And we made him the president.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.049
{\an1}- For women, it's never
been a look to be a side chick.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.761
{\an8}- Yeah--
- Now, hoes be winning.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.721
{\an8}<i>- You know who's also winning?</i>
<i>Kermit the Frog.</i>

17:35.804 --> 17:37.347
{\an8}<i>He's pretty much the mayor</i>
<i>of Side Chick Town.</i>

17:37.431 --> 17:39.892
{\an8}<i>"That moment you see</i>
<i>an old side chick</i>

17:39.975 --> 17:43.020
<i>and she's walking with a kid."</i>

17:43.103 --> 17:44.396
Let's talk about Kermit.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.481
Kermit is from Muppets.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.191
He's not supposed
to be representing

17:47.274 --> 17:49.568
smashing thangs on the side.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.195
- Kermit the Frog
got side chicks.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.905
He drinking Hennessy.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.531
Somebody photoshopped
a cigarette on him.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.076
Like, the places
that I've seen Kermit the Frog,

17:57.159 --> 17:58.160
I was like, "Shit, Kermit,
me too, I relate."

17:58.243 --> 18:00.454
{\an3}- I think it's
also funny 'cause

18:00.537 --> 18:01.789
{\an3}it just represents
a loss of innocence.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.540
{\an1}- Yeah.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.501
{\an3}- It's like when your parents
get divorced or

18:05.584 --> 18:07.127
when you find out your grandpa
cheated on your grandma once.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.837
And Kermit is here
to be like, "Hey,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.506
"your innocence is over

18:10.589 --> 18:11.924
and real stuff is happening."
- [laughs]

18:12.007 --> 18:12.841
- Sip that tea.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.677
I want you guys to give me

18:15.761 --> 18:17.846
some commitment humor memes

18:17.930 --> 18:20.349
<i>for this picture right here.</i>

18:20.432 --> 18:22.684
<i>- When you find</i>
<i>the perfect neighborhood</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:23.519
to raise your family in.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.020
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

18:25.103 --> 18:27.439
With your wife.
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

18:27.523 --> 18:28.649
Because you're faithful.
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

18:28.732 --> 18:29.733
And you don't cheat on her.
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

18:29.817 --> 18:32.569
- When you and your wife

18:32.653 --> 18:33.946
bought your first home

18:34.029 --> 18:35.697
together.
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

18:35.781 --> 18:36.907
<i>- Damn, that ain't funny.</i>

18:36.990 --> 18:39.493
The next meme is

18:39.576 --> 18:41.411
Barack kissing Michelle

18:41.495 --> 18:43.205
<i>in front of an Easter bunny.</i>

18:43.288 --> 18:44.039
- I got one.

18:44.122 --> 18:47.042
"When he went to 'Carrots.'"

18:47.125 --> 18:48.627
[laughs]
<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

18:48.710 --> 18:50.045
- What?
- You stupid, man.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.755
- You--you failed.
- I--I can't.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.549
- Only thing that I can think of
is like,

18:53.632 --> 18:55.801
"When it's a threesome
and you waiting on your turn."

18:55.884 --> 18:57.427
That's--that's the only--
[laughter]

18:57.511 --> 18:58.512
That's all I see right there.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.013
- That was funny.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.059
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

19:04.143 --> 19:06.353
{\an8}[hip-hop instrumental music]

19:09.648 --> 19:12.192
- All right, hey.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.026
Now, before we go,

19:13.110 --> 19:15.362
we have one last thing to do.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.030
And it's "Do Dope Shit."

19:17.114 --> 19:19.408
Now, listen up, Black Twitter.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.951
It's time for us to integrate.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.078
Think of this "Do Dope Shit"

19:23.161 --> 19:24.997
as your <i> Brown versus</i>
<i>Board of Education</i> , okay?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.291
Everyone should be able
to enjoy Black Twitter, right?

19:27.374 --> 19:29.585
Make some noise for that.
That's cool, right?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.503
[cheers and applause]

19:31.587 --> 19:33.964
So let's open up the dialogue.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.258
What I want you to do is this.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.760
Go ahead and find a picture

19:38.844 --> 19:40.762
of Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.348
Something like this.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.310
And I want you to turn it
into a side chick meme.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.104
It is very easy.
Check it out.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.731
"Bae: How many times
have you cheated on me?

19:50.814 --> 19:52.482
<i>Me: Twice."</i>
<i>See?</i>

19:52.566 --> 19:55.444
<i>"When you gave your side chick</i>
<i>500 bucks two months ago</i>

19:55.527 --> 19:58.697
<i>and she shows up to your job</i>
<i>with a baby bump."</i>

19:58.780 --> 20:03.827
{\an3}Look at that face of
terror and disappointment.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.038
<i>"When your side chick</i>
<i>shows up to your job</i>

20:06.121 --> 20:08.123
<i>while you're taking away</i>
<i>health care from the poor."</i>

20:08.206 --> 20:09.666
Look at him.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.751
"Don't [BLEEP] up my moment.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.378
{\an3}I'm [BLEEP] up
other people's lives."

20:13.462 --> 20:16.465
It's that easy.
So that's what I want you to do.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.175
Make your own side chick meme
with this guy

20:18.258 --> 20:19.551
and send it to me.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.845
#DoDopeShit
@HoodAdjacent.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.263
[cheers and applause]

20:23.347 --> 20:26.558
We out.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.309
<i>It's lit!</i>

20:34.566 --> 20:35.734
[bird chirps]
- Oh, no.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.614
{\an3}- Why are jokes about
side chicks and side dudes

20:40.697 --> 20:41.865
{\an3}more popular in
the black community

20:41.949 --> 20:44.284
than in other communities?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.744
Um--

20:45.827 --> 20:47.829
{\an1}- Because black men
are the most faithful.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.331
- To their barbers.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.415
- [laughs]
- No, it's because...
