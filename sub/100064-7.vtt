WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:16.383
We need a Van Helsing to raise
the Dark One.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.719
I harvested everything I need.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.121
An heir and a spare.

00:21.154 --> 00:22.389
Two females...

00:22.422 --> 00:23.590
Oh, my God!

00:25.225 --> 00:27.461
Raising the Dark One is the
answer to all of our problems.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.629
So, when the time is right.

00:30.130 --> 00:30.564
I don't remember requiring
your permission, Michaela,

00:30.964 --> 00:31.665
or your presence.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.034
The Dark One expects us
to be there, Bathory.

00:34.835 --> 00:35.469
I have this feeling
like something

00:36.570 --> 00:38.005
is pulling me towards...
who I thought it was you.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.206
I also feel it.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.541
We'll figure it out together.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.743
To the rise of the Dark One.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.045
(All) To the rise of
the Dark One.

00:50.751 --> 00:56.490
[crows cawing]

00:56.523 --> 00:58.992
(Jack) Maybe we're distant
relations or something.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.661
(Vanessa) Maybe.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.764
Probably, considering.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.533
(Jack) We were adopted, anyway.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.502
Dad never wanted
to talk about it.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.736
The kind of guy he was.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.972
Didn't get along?

01:12.005 --> 01:14.274
I don't know if he's
still alive.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.109
Maybe he's magically
changed somehow,

01:16.143 --> 01:21.448
but once a corporate suit,
always a suit.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.684
I wish I did know more about
my birth parents.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.686
I guess one of them could
have been a Van Helsing.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.055
Maybe a grandparent.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.557
What about your parents?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.626
I'm not sure who my dad was.

01:32.659 --> 01:35.228
I don't know if anyone knew.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.565
I didn't meet my mom
until the day she died.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.734
What happened?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.203
It's a long story.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.606
Pretty sure we're
on a long walk.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.410
It's this way.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.145
I was gonna say
the exact same thing.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.381
How'd you know?

01:54.414 --> 01:55.515
A feeling.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.817
Kind of a tug.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.318
From here, right?

01:58.352 --> 02:01.254
That's it.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.557
Then for sure that way.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.827
So tell me about your mom.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.400
It's in there.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.468
I can feel it.

02:14.501 --> 02:15.168
Yeah.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.304
The pull is getting stronger.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.306
And a bit terrifying.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.108
[thunder rolls]

02:21.141 --> 02:22.242
Okay.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.744
A lot terrifying now.

02:28.248 --> 02:32.252
[thunder rolls]

02:46.800 --> 02:49.569
This looks like the place
where Abby died.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.239
Also where I lost Scarlett.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.308
You said neither of those places
were real.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.211
Or the same.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.381
And yet both of them
are really gone.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.483
So this is it then?

03:03.517 --> 03:06.453
This is where we're supposed
to be?

03:06.486 --> 03:09.222
Right here.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.291
It feels like it is.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.296
I sense it, too.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.365
[gasps]

03:18.398 --> 03:19.399
Oh no!

03:19.733 --> 03:20.901
Vi!

03:20.934 --> 03:21.768
Jack!

03:21.802 --> 03:22.869
I'm so sorry!

03:22.903 --> 03:24.671
It's okay. It's okay.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.906
I didn't mean to.
I didn't know.

03:25.939 --> 03:26.773
I just shot, I'm sorry.

03:26.807 --> 03:27.908
It's okay.

03:29.209 --> 03:29.242
It's nice to see you still have
a quick trigger.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.243
'Kay, just sit still.

03:31.311 --> 03:31.344
We gotta put pressure on it
and stop the bleeding.

03:31.778 --> 03:31.912
No, I got it.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.814
No, don't touch it.
Just let it‐

03:34.381 --> 03:35.582
Vi, what're you doing?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.618
[heavy breathing]

03:46.326 --> 03:47.761
You can do it, too.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.796
Yeah.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.831
You're her.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.403
The one from the visions.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.239
I've been having visions
of you, too.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.375
Somehow I knew I'd find
you here.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.944
Who are you?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.713
I'm Vanessa.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.548
Vanessa Van Helsing.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.742
I thought I left you behind.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.478
We are bound.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.914
You.

04:40.947 --> 04:46.987
So full of potential
and yet still so flawed.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.522
[slap]

04:49.556 --> 04:53.894
Are you trying to awaken
my baser instincts?

04:53.927 --> 04:54.895
[laughs]

04:54.928 --> 04:55.862
Baby.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.397
I don't fear them.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.832
No.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.368
I count on them.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.239
Are you sure?

05:06.273 --> 05:08.375
Dad's one of them.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.777
I think he always was.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.579
It just doesn't make sense.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.015
I mean, him pretending
he's human

05:15.048 --> 05:17.918
and saying that we're
his adopted kids?

05:17.951 --> 05:22.589
I don't think the people he
said were our birth parents

05:22.622 --> 05:25.792
were really our parents
at all.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.428
I got a hold of some files.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.864
Records of how we were born.

05:32.432 --> 05:37.337
Dad made us.

05:37.370 --> 05:42.475
Our fathers are random soldiers
they used as donors.

05:42.509 --> 05:49.549
Does that... does that mean
we're even sisters?

05:49.583 --> 05:53.386
Half, I think.

05:56.523 --> 06:00.660
You thought you could do
this alone?

06:01.895 --> 06:04.564
The Van Helsing are close.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.901
I can feel all of them.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.437
Even if that were true,
what then?

06:10.470 --> 06:14.908
Recovery of the amulet and
the death of them at my hands.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.677
And then what?

06:19.846 --> 06:21.681
I merge with the dark one.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.751
No, not without the ritual.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.089
A ritual you neither know
nor understand.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.759
In your blood lust you forget
the most important part

06:32.792 --> 06:34.594
of your destiny.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.096
Me.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.666
You're wasting your time
with the others.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.468
They are two parts of this.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.003
Two parts you said
we didn't need.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.573
Two parts you despise.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.509
I'm not confused.

06:49.542 --> 06:56.049
I took action while the three
of you were bickering

06:56.082 --> 06:58.551
like children.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.624
[gasps]

07:08.094 --> 07:10.864
[whimpers]
No!!!

07:10.897 --> 07:13.366
[normal voice]
You can't control me.

07:14.501 --> 07:18.772
But I can still serve
your purpose.

07:20.607 --> 07:24.978
I was born in a research
facility.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.547
Me and my sister.

07:27.580 --> 07:32.819
They engineered us.

07:32.852 --> 07:37.557
They mixed our DNA.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.894
Half human, half vampire.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.063
What?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.764
No.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.534
I can't be one of those things.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.638
Jack.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.640
Hey, it's ok.

07:53.673 --> 07:57.577
You said Hansen
was a corporate suit.

07:57.610 --> 08:01.548
Doesn't happen to be
a Blak‐Tek suit, does it?

08:03.616 --> 08:06.086
They're involved in this.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.587
Who knows? Maybe everything
that's happened

08:07.620 --> 08:09.022
is because of them.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.424
Our whole life is a lie.

08:13.493 --> 08:18.031
Listen, if I've learned anything
in all of this

08:18.064 --> 08:21.735
it's that you can't dwell
on the past.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.037
Okay? You guys have each other.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.473
Cherish that.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.041
Depend on it.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.915
[thunder rolls]

08:35.949 --> 08:38.985
She's right.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.320
It's about us now.

08:41.788 --> 08:51.965
Help me take the final step to
become one with your beloved.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.534
It is what we both want.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.703
There will be no turning back.

08:56.736 --> 09:01.474
It's all I desire now.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.911
Don't keep it from me.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.514
As you wish.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.095
You need to keep watch.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.265
While‐ while you do what?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.115
You trust her?

09:42.148 --> 09:43.183
Yeah.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.617
Absolutely.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.021
Good.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.190
'Cause other than you

09:50.223 --> 09:52.926
I don't know who
to trust anymore.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.627
We'll figure this out.

09:54.661 --> 09:58.998
This changing people back,
the healing.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.700
We'll figure it out together.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.170
Hey! I need your help.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.974
Look.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.209
See the hand prints?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.710
Yeah.

10:10.743 --> 10:11.578
What are they for?

10:12.579 --> 10:13.847
Well, in the past
they've opened something.

10:14.714 --> 10:15.815
But it only works
for Van Helsings.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.884
You ready to find out
who you really are?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.055
We're not going anywhere.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.223
Okay.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.724
Brace yourselves.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.931
I think you should do it
at the same time, okay?

10:31.965 --> 10:32.899
Ready?

10:34.701 --> 10:40.707
Three... two... one...

10:44.077 --> 10:46.079
[struggling grunts]

10:49.349 --> 10:50.850
Nothing's happening.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.185
You call this nothing?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.892
Give me your hands!

11:17.777 --> 11:23.316
And light shall lead darkness
to its end.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.385
[thunder rolls]

11:36.696 --> 11:37.797
It's alright.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.732
It's alright.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.601
It's day but now it's night.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.769
How can that be?

11:42.802 --> 11:43.803
This place isn't real.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.339
It's more of a state of mind.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.142
So those dreams
where we‐

11:49.175 --> 11:51.377
No. They were real.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.245
And we need to be careful.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.748
The last time I was here
I wasn't alone.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.684
Where's Jack?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.651
Jack?!

11:58.685 --> 11:59.619
Stop.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.521
I have to find her.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.825
Jack!

12:36.723 --> 12:37.857
(Soft Voice) Come!

12:40.426 --> 12:42.462
Come to me.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.703
Come to me.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.377
Vi?

13:03.449 --> 13:07.820
Come to me. Come to me.
Come to me.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.391
Jack?!

13:11.891 --> 13:12.925
Jack?!

13:14.060 --> 13:14.894
Jack!

13:14.927 --> 13:16.462
Hey. Hey.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.997
You need to calm down.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.332
Okay?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.000
Maybe she didn't make the trip.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.269
I'm still unsure
how all this works.

13:23.303 --> 13:28.508
(Abraham)
It's in the blood.

13:28.541 --> 13:34.080
Has been for generations.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.449
Stay close.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.482
What is this place?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.089
I don't know.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.828
Don't move!

14:25.698 --> 14:26.899
Jacob?

14:26.933 --> 14:28.067
Jacob?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.903
No, my dear.

14:30.937 --> 14:33.406
I am not Jacob.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.478
I'm his brother.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.981
Abraham Van Helsing.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.760
Come.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.696
Come to me.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.548
You've been warned.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.783
Stay back.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.818
Come.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.019
I am no threat.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.687
I used to be a threat.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.557
The greatest threat a vampire
had ever known.

15:24.590 --> 15:33.566
But now you, and you,
both fine, capable,

15:33.599 --> 15:35.701
our legacy and bloodline
forever staying strong,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.437
I see, yes?

15:38.504 --> 15:39.772
Yes.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.042
What are your names,
may I ask?

15:43.075 --> 15:45.578
This is Violet and I'm Vanessa.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.414
Vanessa.

15:51.484 --> 15:55.087
Named after one of the finest
Van Helsings I ever knew.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.062
Now, you must have
what I need.

16:03.095 --> 16:03.830
Need for what?

16:04.430 --> 16:05.898
To kill the Dark One,
of course.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.802
Entombed with me in the dark
realm but still very much alive.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.370
Dark One?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.872
Tha... tha... that doesn't
sound good.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.107
Come now, you must have
the means to destroy it.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.943
Show me.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.578
We have this.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.751
And this.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.591
You have not made a weapon
to destroy it?

16:33.793 --> 16:37.063
The family must have created
a means to kill it

16:37.096 --> 16:38.965
after all these years.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.613
The pages, they're gone!

16:53.646 --> 16:55.915
But where?

16:55.948 --> 16:57.750
Where?

16:57.783 --> 16:59.986
The family was torn apart.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.088
Our history was lost.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.658
I don't know anything about
a weapon or pages.

17:07.793 --> 17:08.761
No.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.567
All for nothing?

17:19.171 --> 17:23.743
Centuries of loneliness and pain
for nothing?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.851
What happened to you?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.786
How did you get here?

17:37.857 --> 17:42.995
Our attempts to kill the Dark
One had all failed

17:43.029 --> 17:49.035
and when my dear brother,
Jacob, was turned I...

17:49.068 --> 17:52.071
I knew what I had to do.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.942
Without a weapon powerful enough
to kill it

17:55.975 --> 17:58.978
I realized my best hope
was to trap the Dark One

17:59.011 --> 18:00.780
in the realm of darkness.

18:00.813 --> 18:05.151
I threw myself and it,
the demon, through,

18:05.184 --> 18:07.219
severing all ties.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.189
So you've been trapped
in the dark realm with it?

18:10.222 --> 18:11.057
Yes.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.660
Come to me.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.230
Yes.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.334
Come to me.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.068
Closer.

18:25.338 --> 18:30.710
Come closer.
See me.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.879
Be one with me.

18:33.913 --> 18:38.918
These are the means to open
the portal to the dark realm,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.887
activated by our blood.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.091
And under no circumstance
must it be opened

18:45.124 --> 18:48.194
without the means to kill it
once and for all.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.996
I won't let that happen.

18:50.029 --> 18:53.699
You must be very cautious,
my dear.

18:53.733 --> 18:58.871
The darkness has seduced
more than one Van Helsing.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.706
I can see this through.

19:00.740 --> 19:06.078
I sense great darkness in you,
Vanessa.

19:06.112 --> 19:10.049
One that could put all humanity
in grave danger.

19:11.584 --> 19:16.188
And I pray it does not reside
with the other.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.191
What do you mean?

19:19.859 --> 19:22.061
Yes.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.929
Come to me.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.170
No! This cannot be!

20:04.203 --> 20:04.904
What's happening?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.773
The Dark One, it has
been awoken.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.713
Be one with me.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.534
[choking]

20:41.874 --> 20:44.877
No. No.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.712
What have you not told me?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.880
What?!

20:47.913 --> 20:49.248
‐Jack!
‐Jack!

20:49.281 --> 20:50.216
Who is this?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.450
Vi, Something happened!

20:51.484 --> 20:52.218
Something terrible!

20:52.251 --> 20:52.918
No.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.720
What have you done?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.589
Here. You must make
a weapon.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.557
Find the pages,
open the portal.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.160
Only then you can kill the Dark
One, once and for all.

21:01.193 --> 21:01.961
Now, go.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.663
And take your children
with you.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.066
Go!

21:10.903 --> 21:12.571
Jack?

21:15.107 --> 21:16.642
What happened to you in there?

21:16.675 --> 21:17.643
I don't know.

21:18.744 --> 21:18.778
I ended up in this dark room
and there was something

21:19.879 --> 21:21.914
and it was calling to me
and I couldn't resist it.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.915
It's okay.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.716
We're out.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.684
We have to do what he told us.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.654
Fashion a weapon
with no instructions.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.193
What did Abraham mean
when he said "your children"?

21:34.226 --> 21:35.928
I don't know.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.596
I mean, it's not possible.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.231
Yes, it is.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.567
We were created from eggs
that were harvested

21:41.600 --> 21:45.971
from a four‐year‐old girl
they were experimenting on.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.073
It was you.

21:48.107 --> 21:52.077
We came from you.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.880
And that makes you...

21:54.914 --> 21:56.682
Your mother.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.290
[distant singing]

22:04.323 --> 22:06.125
What the hell is that?

22:06.158 --> 22:10.262
[distant singing]

22:10.296 --> 22:11.997
Sam.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.035
Could it be?

22:16.068 --> 22:20.005
She's a Van Helsing, too.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.642
Such a pretty family picture.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.312
Stay behind me.

22:26.345 --> 22:32.985
Hansen, with love, he said
there was no other.

22:33.018 --> 22:39.658
The other bride, so full of lies
and deception.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.861
Those are the vampires
I saw with Dad.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.662
Only way uglier now.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.764
I need you both to get as
far away from here as possible.

22:45.798 --> 22:46.832
We're not leaving you.

22:46.866 --> 22:47.766
Yeah, we can help.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.667
Listen to me.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.638
Your survival is the only thing
that matters.

22:52.671 --> 22:55.841
These two are mine.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.876
Go!

22:57.643 --> 22:59.011
[growls]

23:03.883 --> 23:05.284
[snarling]

23:29.975 --> 23:31.243
[thud]

23:34.914 --> 23:36.081
Jack!

23:36.949 --> 23:44.023
[fighting grunts]

23:44.056 --> 23:48.727
Your fear is intoxicating.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.364
But it's not your time to die.

23:52.398 --> 23:53.866
Yet.

24:01.974 --> 24:07.012
[fighting grunts]

24:12.017 --> 24:13.419
Ahh!!!

24:13.819 --> 24:16.822
I'll miss causing you
such pain.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.024
You'll never win.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.760
You don't understand.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.429
I already have.

24:36.141 --> 24:39.211
[choking]

24:46.485 --> 24:49.655
[laughing maniacally]

24:53.525 --> 24:58.297
[laughing]

24:59.198 --> 25:04.203
[snarling]

25:18.217 --> 25:20.819
[snarling]
Oh, doesn't it hurt?

25:22.388 --> 25:24.790
[gasps]

25:24.823 --> 25:31.497
I remember reading Frankenstein
when I was just a boy.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.498
The good doctor, he‐

25:33.632 --> 25:37.469
he tried to make a creature
just to see if he could.

25:37.503 --> 25:43.142
Some people thought
the creature was the villain.

25:43.175 --> 25:49.615
And then, for others,
he was a hero.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.518
You're no hero.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.153
I wasn't talking about me.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.855
I meant you.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.490
They made you, too.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.692
An abomination.

26:00.726 --> 26:04.763
A dark secret that was meant
to fail.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.698
Go to hell.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.734
I plan to, right here.

26:08.767 --> 26:11.437
On earth.

26:11.470 --> 26:12.838
You've made that possible.

26:12.871 --> 26:16.408
You and your offspring.

26:16.442 --> 26:19.878
I'm here because of you.

26:19.912 --> 26:25.684
Everything you've done,
everything you are.

26:25.717 --> 26:30.656
My ascendance is because
of you.

26:30.689 --> 26:39.498
It's of your making and I will
revel in your destruction.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.599
And theirs.

26:40.632 --> 26:42.801
It is time.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.537
Take the amulet from her.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.690
[groans]

27:04.723 --> 27:07.259
Suffer.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.195
It's what you were made for.

27:12.931 --> 27:16.668
My beloved would have preferred
consuming you.

27:16.702 --> 27:20.472
A pretty plaything.

27:20.506 --> 27:26.745
Another Van Helsing
seduced to our dark hearts.

27:26.778 --> 27:29.581
But you've made your choice.

27:29.615 --> 27:32.751
Does he know he's a pawn?

27:32.784 --> 27:34.753
A sacrifice?

27:34.786 --> 27:36.555
Clever girl.

27:36.588 --> 27:40.559
But in the end I'm giving
him a gift.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.494
You're using him.

27:42.528 --> 27:47.399
We all get used,
each in our own way.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.935
Surrender to that truth

27:49.968 --> 27:54.907
and all this will be so much
easier to accept.

27:54.973 --> 28:02.748
[speaking Latin]

28:02.781 --> 28:13.425
[speaking Latin]

28:13.458 --> 28:16.762
[speaking Latin]

28:19.698 --> 28:23.435
It comes to this,
my chosen.

28:23.468 --> 28:28.607
Take the amulet, drink the blood
of the Dark One.

28:28.640 --> 28:33.579
Complete the pathway
and open the portal.

28:34.646 --> 28:37.382
Sam, listen to me.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.418
You don't want to do this.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.621
Think, Sam. Think.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.857
Why you, huh?

28:45.891 --> 28:50.562
You really believe you get
to become the Dark One?

28:50.596 --> 28:54.499
She offered the fourth elder
to both of us.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.567
Why?

28:55.601 --> 28:58.036
So we could become stronger
than she is?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.905
Or so we can be sacrificed?

28:59.938 --> 29:01.440
Do it.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.610
Fulfil your destiny.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.712
Maybe your destiny
is your downfall.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.915
My downfall was being born.

29:09.948 --> 29:15.020
Pain and suffering of trying
to be human.

29:15.053 --> 29:22.995
Darkness that made inside of me
could never be undone.

29:23.028 --> 29:26.465
I must evolve.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.668
Fulfil my final purpose.

29:46.885 --> 29:51.023
Each step you took
led you to this.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.771
You are fully formed now.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.107
And one with your darkness.

30:09.141 --> 30:14.713
Ready to embrace
your true purpose.

30:18.016 --> 30:18.884
I feel it...

30:18.917 --> 30:21.653
[gasps]

30:21.687 --> 30:24.122
Coursing through me.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.725
Yes.

30:26.758 --> 30:31.697
Merging with me!

30:32.964 --> 30:35.534
Ahhhhh!!!!!!

30:46.044 --> 30:47.079
What?

30:49.047 --> 30:54.086
is thi... thi... this?

30:54.119 --> 30:55.687
The Dark One.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.757
You have liberated her.

31:08.967 --> 31:11.703
No, ah!

31:28.987 --> 31:31.089
You.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.160
Behold.

31:35.193 --> 31:38.697
Yes.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.600
Your master.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.142
Wonderful.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.746
[laughter]

31:58.683 --> 32:00.519
[loud thud]

32:03.955 --> 32:05.991
Dracula.

32:30.982 --> 32:35.220
This wld

32:35.253 --> 32:39.057
I sensed it's gathering evil.

32:39.090 --> 32:43.061
The return to the black centre
of its core.

32:43.094 --> 32:46.798
But this is better than
I thought.

32:46.832 --> 32:50.135
More black than ever.

32:50.168 --> 32:54.706
Purging itself of love and joy.

32:54.739 --> 33:00.145
Hail Dracula.

33:00.178 --> 33:05.083
Ruler of the darkness,
commander of my soul.

33:05.116 --> 33:06.985
Bathory.

33:07.018 --> 33:10.155
My first and most
enduring bride.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.257
I am here, my beloved.

33:12.290 --> 33:15.026
Here to worship the evil
within you.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.829
To bask in your darkness.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.265
You are the one who raised me
from my torment.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.867
Yes.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.301
Who created the fourth?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.537
I discovered him as a child.

33:25.570 --> 33:29.708
A seed of pure evil,
nestled in his soul.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.344
And you nurtured it,
encouraged it to grow.

33:32.377 --> 33:33.845
Yes.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.847
To create a dark vessel.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.116
An entranceway between
this world and the void.

33:38.149 --> 33:40.418
Yes. I did that for you.

33:40.452 --> 33:45.123
Years of careful labour.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.193
And so you come here alone.

33:54.232 --> 33:59.004
Tell me, why did you not
bring the others?

33:59.037 --> 34:03.008
Shouldn't all of my wives
be here to meet me?

34:03.041 --> 34:06.211
Don't I deserve to feed
on their devotion, as well?

34:06.244 --> 34:10.382
The time of your return
was unexpected.

34:10.415 --> 34:14.252
The fourth acted rashly,
without consent.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.389
The fourth was your
creation alone.

34:17.422 --> 34:20.225
The fault must all be yours.

34:20.258 --> 34:21.393
Am I wrong?

34:21.426 --> 34:25.297
I swear I did not fail you.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.399
The other brides are in waiting

34:27.432 --> 34:28.900
I woke Michaela.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.035
Hansen is by her side.

34:31.336 --> 34:33.104
They're ready to worship you
for the goddess that you are.

34:33.772 --> 34:37.008
Once again I tire of you,
Bathory.

34:37.042 --> 34:41.513
Years and years of your failed
attempts to please me.

34:41.546 --> 34:46.184
And you disappoint me
yet again.

34:47.118 --> 34:50.288
I have brought you a gift.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.524
Look.

34:52.557 --> 34:55.360
The last of the Van Helsings.

34:55.393 --> 35:00.098
The only mortals capable
of your destruction.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.533
Hmm.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.102
A Van Helsing.

35:04.135 --> 35:07.005
And a powerful one,
it seems.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.174
And these two,
her spawn?

35:09.207 --> 35:10.375
Yes.

35:10.408 --> 35:12.444
All strong and virile.

35:12.477 --> 35:17.449
Prepare to feed
your every desire.

35:21.319 --> 35:25.390
Exquisite.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.360
Fascinating.

35:31.296 --> 35:36.368
And still I sense some of myself
within you.

35:36.401 --> 35:39.371
But how can that be?

35:39.404 --> 35:42.440
I was made with your blood.

35:42.474 --> 35:46.011
It is in me now.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.512
Rooted at the core.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.081
Yes.

35:50.115 --> 35:53.318
The beauty of my essence flows
within you.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.254
Them, as well.

35:56.287 --> 36:00.025
Don't touch them!

36:00.058 --> 36:01.993
They're mine.

36:03.028 --> 36:06.097
This one I will keep.

36:06.131 --> 36:10.402
But the children, I wish
to bathe in their blood.

36:10.435 --> 36:14.472
To wash away the years
of deprivation.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.609
You will not.

36:17.642 --> 36:21.279
What is this?

36:21.312 --> 36:25.083
There's more of me in you
than any Van Helsing,

36:25.116 --> 36:27.452
that I have ever known.

36:27.485 --> 36:32.357
But you will still
bow down.

36:32.390 --> 36:36.127
It is your fate.

36:36.161 --> 36:39.631
I bow to no one.

36:39.664 --> 36:42.634
You dare to defy me?

36:42.667 --> 36:46.871
To fire my anger.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.273
No.

36:48.306 --> 36:56.381
You misunderstand me,
my master.

36:56.414 --> 37:03.054
I wish to stand by your side,
not bow at your feet.

37:03.088 --> 37:04.589
What deception is this?

37:04.622 --> 37:06.658
No deception.

37:06.691 --> 37:13.231
Let me offer them to you
as a show of my devotion.

37:18.436 --> 37:19.337
Do not trust her.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.873
The Van Helsings
are treacherous.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.374
Deadly. They‐

37:23.408 --> 37:24.876
Silence.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.447
I will grant you this wish...

37:31.182 --> 37:33.451
My curious new toy.

37:35.420 --> 37:42.260
Spill the blood of your children
so that I may cleanse myself.

37:51.236 --> 37:52.470
[groans]

37:52.504 --> 37:54.105
What's happening?

37:54.405 --> 37:55.573
Vanessa?

37:56.341 --> 37:58.109
What're you doing?

37:58.143 --> 37:59.244
[gasps]

37:59.277 --> 38:00.445
Run when you can.

38:00.478 --> 38:01.412
Find the pages.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.447
No.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.149
Don't be afraid.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.117
[gasps]

38:12.023 --> 38:14.325
I could always feel
the darkness in you.

38:14.359 --> 38:16.494
It's in you, too.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.396
Fight it.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.340
[gasping]

38:33.745 --> 38:37.482
I must have you
as my newest bride.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.652
No!

38:40.685 --> 38:42.754
I am your one!

38:42.787 --> 38:44.923
Your only!

38:45.690 --> 38:50.662
If you had ever been enough
for me there would be only you.

38:50.695 --> 38:53.431
And just like my affection
for you,

38:53.464 --> 38:56.434
this world's light
must be extinguished.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.505
Come.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.341
Bask in my glory.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.617
Fulfil your destiny.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.620
Like Jacob before you.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.289
Join by my side

39:18.323 --> 39:21.726
as we welcome the dawning
of the eternal darkness.

39:21.759 --> 39:28.166
As I unleash the power of hell
to rule this world.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.339
Come.

39:34.372 --> 39:41.179
Take my hand, my newest
concubine.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.086
Become one with
the darkness.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.555
That's exactly what I had
in mind.

39:53.224 --> 40:00.331
Oh, you don't know how long
I've waited for this moment.

40:02.400 --> 40:09.440
[gasps]

40:09.474 --> 40:12.176
Because you're right.

40:13.611 --> 40:17.382
This is my destiny.

40:18.483 --> 40:25.089
I long to be by your side,
intertwined.

40:25.123 --> 40:29.260
Together.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.362
Forever.

40:33.831 --> 40:37.101
There's just one thing
you should know.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.877
Nobody with my family!

40:45.910 --> 40:47.111
[cries out]

41:06.965 --> 41:11.502
No! No!

41:13.004 --> 41:14.038
Vanessa?

41:14.906 --> 41:17.508
Hey.

41:17.542 --> 41:18.776
She sacrificed herself for us.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.545
I need you to find the amulet.

41:23.014 --> 41:23.948
Get the book.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.583
Find those pages and go.

41:26.617 --> 41:27.952
What're you doing?

41:31.889 --> 41:36.494
You insolent children!

41:38.563 --> 41:39.597
We're Van Helsings!

41:39.630 --> 41:40.832
We're meant for sacrifice!

41:40.865 --> 41:42.233
I can't leave you!

41:46.004 --> 41:47.071
Come on, Jack!

41:47.105 --> 41:48.106
I need you to go!

41:48.139 --> 41:49.640
Now!

41:49.674 --> 41:50.908
Go!

41:50.942 --> 41:54.379
My beloved will rise again.

41:54.412 --> 41:58.950
And when she does it will be
through your blood!

41:58.983 --> 42:01.586
Spawn of Abraham!

42:02.020 --> 42:04.122
My mother's name is Vanessa.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.190
[screaming]
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

42:06.224 --> 42:09.527
(Bathory) Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

42:38.923 --> 42:44.796
[bells tolling in the distance]

42:52.170 --> 42:54.539
There's still hope.
