01:04.400 --> 01:06.834
My heart! My heart!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.834
Everything's going black.
I'm coming to you, Sallie.

01:08.900 --> 01:14.300
Ma. Oh, God! Oh, God!
Hang on, Ma! Please hang on!

01:14.367 --> 01:16.166
All right, but you have to do me a favor.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.066
To the moon, Ma.

01:19.934 --> 01:22.266
If you wanted a favor, you could just ask.

01:22.333 --> 01:26.700
There are two things I look forward to.
Both involve yanking a chain.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.934
Has anybody seen Blanche?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.233
She had a date last night,

01:32.300 --> 01:35.467
and this morning her bed's made,
and she's not there.

01:36.367 --> 01:39.667
Wait a minute.
Here's our walking playground now.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.066
Boy, it must be true love.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.300
This guy's slowing down
to 5 miles an hour.

01:44.367 --> 01:45.900
(car door shuts)

01:45.967 --> 01:49.367
-Good morning, everybody.
-Blanche, what is going on?

01:49.433 --> 01:52.100
That guy's a little young, even for you.

01:52.166 --> 01:55.767
He's a mature young man
with his own business.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.467
Who wants to help me
pick out five magazines?

02:00.233 --> 02:04.000
-Blanche.
-I'm in no mood for ridicule.

02:04.066 --> 02:07.600
-I've been going through a tough time.
-And we're concerned, Blanche.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.367
Jealous and concerned.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.066
You haven't drowned
yourself in young men

02:12.133 --> 02:15.233
since this time last year
when you brought twins home

02:15.300 --> 02:17.700
from the Jimmy Smits look-alike contest.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.734
Oh, yeah. Jorge and Esteban.

02:23.166 --> 02:27.033
Romantic, passionate,
and virtually interchangeable.

02:28.533 --> 02:29.867
Rose is right.

02:29.934 --> 02:33.066
Every year at this time
you start robbing the cra...

02:33.367 --> 02:35.400
Hey, wait a minute.

02:35.734 --> 02:38.934
By any chance, does somebody have
a birthday coming up?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.900
Yes, damn it. It's almost my birthday.
I intend to forget about it.

02:43.967 --> 02:46.300
If you're my friends, you'll forget, too.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.800
And never bring the
sordid subject up again.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.633
I know. I'm going to give her a party.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.266
You know, I actually feel sorry
for Blanche.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.700
Don't you, Ma?

03:01.834 --> 03:03.100
Who's ma?

03:04.266 --> 03:05.400
Who are you?

03:06.033 --> 03:08.266
Just ask the damn favor.

03:08.867 --> 03:12.800
-I need your help tonight for a charity.
-I have a date.

03:12.867 --> 03:16.800
You call that a date? Thyroid Freddie.
His eyes bug right out of his head.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.467
He looks like he's being choked.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.233
Freddie is a fine man.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.500
When he was younger,
he could have been an astronaut,

03:24.567 --> 03:27.333
except for, well... that eye thing.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.467
I've been working for this meals on wheels
program.

03:32.533 --> 03:36.467
-I need a driver. Please.
-Oh, all right, Ma.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.300
I'll cancel banjo eyes.

03:40.567 --> 03:44.133
Don't worry.
There will be other dates, Gloria.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.367
Ma, Gloria is my sister.
I'm Dorothy.

03:48.433 --> 03:50.700
I know. There will be other dates
for Gloria.

03:52.166 --> 03:57.233
(serene music playing)

03:58.900 --> 04:03.500
I gotta agree with you, Mrs. Ferguson,
Bobby Vitten is the king of rock and roll.

04:05.734 --> 04:07.133
Ma, it's getting late.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.767
Do you have to stay and visit
with every one of them?

04:09.834 --> 04:12.367
Excuse me for trying to get
more involved in their lives.

04:12.433 --> 04:16.600
Well, that's fine, Ma, but did we really
have to worm Mrs. Jenkins' dog?

04:18.066 --> 04:19.133
Bup-bup-bup-bup.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.266
I always just leave this one
outside the door.

04:21.333 --> 04:24.200
-Really?
-It's been that way since I took over.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.033
Ok.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.934
This is Mrs. Taylor.
You'll get along with her fine.

04:31.266 --> 04:35.734
Two things. 1, compliment her cat,
and 2, Jews control the planet.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
Got it.

04:39.066 --> 04:41.934
Oh, hi, Fluffy. Looking good.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.200
Ma.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.133
He's not old.

04:49.433 --> 04:52.066
He's a perfectly healthy young man.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.266
Just be home before midnight, Dorothy.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.367
-Excuse me, sir--
-Go away.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.900
Just a minute.

05:03.533 --> 05:06.834
You're not old. You're not ill. You're...

05:07.333 --> 05:09.200
no slave to fashion.

05:10.433 --> 05:15.433
-Why are you taking this food?
-I'm hungry, and I'm on the list.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.834
-Who do you think you are?
-Sergeant Zbornak, food police.

05:20.033 --> 05:22.734
I don't want any trouble.
Just hand over that turkey loaf.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.700
You can't. I need this food.
Except for the carrot-raisin salad.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.834
I've never understood carrot-raisin salad.

05:30.266 --> 05:34.567
No, Mrs. Taylor. It's Flintstone,
not Flintstein.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.667
Lovely neighbors you got, Mr.--
No, no. Get away.

05:39.734 --> 05:43.000
-Go over there. Move.
-Ok. Ok. Take it easy.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.033
Who's the macadamia?

05:47.867 --> 05:50.567
So, uh, how are you doing today?

05:50.633 --> 05:54.500
Look, I don't understand.
You're obviously not handicapped.

05:54.567 --> 05:58.433
-I'm as disabled as anyone here.
-I find that hard to believe.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.066
You don't understand.
It's just too hard out there.

06:03.533 --> 06:06.433
I haven't been out
of this apartment in 22 years.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.633
I'm...I'm sorry. I didn't know.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.000
Enjoy your dinner.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.033
How pathetic.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.200
A person could live their life totally
alone,

06:23.266 --> 06:28.166
devoid of companionship or love.
I wish I could do something.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.400
Start a club.

06:31.867 --> 06:35.767
(calm music playing)

06:38.500 --> 06:41.266
Dorothy, how did things go tonight?

06:41.867 --> 06:45.633
I am so happy
that I volunteered for meals on wheels.

06:45.700 --> 06:48.700
I think I'm really
making progress with Jimmy,

06:48.767 --> 06:52.033
although I could make more
if ma would stop yelling "boo."

06:53.400 --> 06:55.667
You're really taking an interest
in that man.

06:55.734 --> 06:57.133
What happened to him?

06:57.200 --> 07:00.667
The turmoil of the sixties
just got to him.

07:00.734 --> 07:03.433
The '60s were an emotional time
for all of us.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.734
I can still see big daddy
sitting on the porch,

07:05.800 --> 07:10.734
swing, swilling down home brew,
picking off peaceniks with his bb gun.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.400
Oh, God, I miss that man.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.767
Come on, honey, I'm sure grand dragon,

07:18.834 --> 07:22.834
I mean, "big daddy," is always with you.

07:25.633 --> 07:26.900
Thank you.

07:26.967 --> 07:29.500
I can see why your friend
got disillusioned,

07:29.567 --> 07:32.166
but I don't see why he withdrew
for 22 years.

07:32.233 --> 07:33.500
Oh, I can.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.133
It happened to me.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.000
When Stanley walked out,
I was so devastated,

07:38.066 --> 07:40.000
I locked myself in my bedroom.

07:40.066 --> 07:43.200
It was the one place
that didn't remind me of Stan.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.900
I never wanted to come out.

07:46.467 --> 07:50.166
Fortunately, someone was there
to get me out of that room.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.734
-Thanks, Ma.
-Sure, pussycat.

07:52.800 --> 07:58.300
You know, Sophia, this birthday thing kind
of has me depressed as well.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.533
-Could you help me, too?
-Sure.

08:01.233 --> 08:04.600
No matter how bad things get,
remember these sage words...

08:04.667 --> 08:06.900
you're old, you sag, get over it.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.700
Sophia.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.133
So what if you knew Jesus personally.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.133
Wake up and smell the coffee, you fossil.

08:22.767 --> 08:23.767
My mistake.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.800
I thought since you looked like Yoda,
you were also wise.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.367
(door shuts)

08:34.500 --> 08:35.767
Here it is!

08:36.433 --> 08:39.033
I needed to know when
Blanche's real birthday was

08:39.100 --> 08:40.767
so I could throw her a party.

08:40.834 --> 08:44.133
So I got copies of her birth certificate,
her DM files--

08:44.200 --> 08:46.333
Wait a minute. Rose.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.133
That is an invasion of privacy.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.000
What makes you think she wants a party?

08:51.066 --> 08:54.433
Everybody wants a party
no matter what they say.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.433
But if you think
we don't need to know Blanche's real age--

08:58.500 --> 09:00.033
Open the damn envelope.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.500
I can't believe it.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.333
After all these years,
we're finally going to know

09:05.400 --> 09:08.100
the true age of Blanche Devereaux.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.834
"Deleted by authority of the governor."

09:18.767 --> 09:20.967
Oh, they... these are all like that.

09:21.033 --> 09:24.333
-You know what this means.
-Yeah.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.333
She must have really jumped
on this guy's bandwagon.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.066
You almost got it, Rose.

09:31.834 --> 09:34.166
(telephone rings)

09:34.667 --> 09:35.767
Hello?

09:35.834 --> 09:38.333
Jimmy. It's me, Dorothy.

09:38.734 --> 09:42.867
I'm fine, thanks. What's new with you?
Oh, of course. Nothing.

09:45.100 --> 09:50.400
That's wonderful.
No, no, no, no. I'll be right over.

09:51.100 --> 09:55.166
I have done it. A breakthrough.
Jimmy is tired of isolating.

09:55.233 --> 09:56.834
Oh, that's great, Dorothy.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.800
I don't think I like this whole situation,
pussycat.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.100
Oh, come on, Ma. I'm helping.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.467
You're not a shrink.
Don't let your ego get involved.

10:05.533 --> 10:09.533
My ego is not involved.
Look, I'm nobody special, Ma.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.066
I'm just an average citizen.
I saw another citizen and I reached out.

10:14.133 --> 10:18.734
A man changed his life, and I'm just
somebody who helped him do it.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.533
Me. Dorothy Zbornak.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.333
Miracle worker.

10:23.433 --> 10:28.266
(mellow music playing)

10:30.300 --> 10:31.400
(knocking on door)

10:40.800 --> 10:42.066
Who is it?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.700
Jimmy, open the door.

10:46.333 --> 10:50.266
-Dorothy. I'm so glad you came.
-Of course I came.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.367
-This is a big day for you.
-It is.

10:52.433 --> 10:56.266
I can't live like this anymore.
I am so happy.

10:56.333 --> 11:01.066
I am, too. Hey, let's celebrate.
Party time.

11:01.734 --> 11:04.934
♪ <i>The answer, my</i><i>friend</i> ♪

11:05.000 --> 11:07.266
-♪ <i>Is blowin' in the wind--</i> ♪
-Jimmy.

11:07.934 --> 11:11.367
Why don't we save this
as sort of a treat for later on?

11:12.033 --> 11:14.166
First there's something I want you to do.

11:14.734 --> 11:16.667
I want you to step out here...

11:17.400 --> 11:19.734
the way you do when you pick up your tray.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.767
Ok.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.633
Now take another.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.734
Come on. Come on.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.900
Now how about one more?

11:39.633 --> 11:42.200
That wasn't so hard. How does it feel?

11:42.266 --> 11:45.600
So many years inside,
I forgot how much I love to travel.

11:47.767 --> 11:51.767
You put one foot in front of the other.
That's all it takes.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.767
We're going to get you to that counselor.

11:54.834 --> 11:59.033
-Oh, no. We're not going to any counselor.
-I thought you were tired of isolating?

11:59.100 --> 12:03.533
I am. You're the first person
I've trusted in years,

12:03.600 --> 12:07.266
and you're absolutely wonderful,
and I want you to live with me.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.533
Live here?

12:10.600 --> 12:13.333
Yeah. All this can be yours.

12:15.934 --> 12:19.967
All this?
Well, it does sweeten the pot, but...

12:20.033 --> 12:22.000
Jimmy, I think you're missing the point.

12:22.066 --> 12:25.467
You could name six of the Chicago seven.
I love you.

12:25.533 --> 12:29.000
-Don't say that. David Dillinger.
-Seven. Take me.

12:30.667 --> 12:36.100
Look, Jimmy, I like you,
but not in that way.

12:37.934 --> 12:42.066
The first person I reach out
to in 22 years,

12:42.133 --> 12:43.700
-and you reject me.
-But, Jimmy--

12:43.767 --> 12:46.834
No, no, forget it.
You can't trust anybody.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.300
I thought this wasn't
going to be my prison.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.667
I thought I remembered what happy was.
Thanks, Dorothy.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.433
I'm never going to leave
this apartment again.

12:55.500 --> 13:01.767
(calm music playing)

13:05.400 --> 13:09.300
(serene music playing)

13:09.367 --> 13:11.300
Miracle worker. I'm an idiot.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.633
Stop beating yourself over the head
with this.

13:14.700 --> 13:19.166
You didn't make him drop out
or make him a recluse.

13:19.233 --> 13:22.834
You didn't make him decide
to live his life behind closed doors.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.200
You're just the one who made it stick.

13:28.633 --> 13:31.166
Don't worry. Maybe
Jimmy will come around.

13:31.233 --> 13:34.834
I wish I could believe you,
but I've been there.

13:35.133 --> 13:39.300
After a while, you feel you're in this
gigantic black hole.

13:39.367 --> 13:43.233
-We had a gigantic black hole in St. Olaf.
-Oh, God.

13:45.433 --> 13:48.233
On main street,
right in front of the courthouse

13:48.300 --> 13:52.133
where Charlie and I got our marriage
license and our permit to have kids.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.233
It was a lovely hole.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.333
Everybody in town would stand around
and look in it.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.567
And they say Hollywood is the
entertainment capital of the world.

14:04.266 --> 14:07.567
We didn't just look in it.
Sometimes we'd point, too.

14:09.033 --> 14:10.600
Or spit and time it.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.033
Then there was always that wise guy

14:17.100 --> 14:20.500
who'd have a couple of drinks
and unzip himself and...

14:23.166 --> 14:25.400
It's official. I hate her.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.867
-Dorothy.
-I just want to call him.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.967
Pussycat, you're out of your league.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.367
There are some people you just can't help.

14:38.433 --> 14:41.100
It's like the good lord said,
you got to know when to hold them...

14:41.467 --> 14:44.934
know when to fold them,
know when to walk away.

14:45.367 --> 14:48.066
That's not the good lord.
That's Kenny Rogers.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.900
God, Kenny Rogers, tomato, to-mah-to,

14:50.967 --> 14:53.333
the point is there are others
you can help.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.000
All those people on our route,
they depend on us.

14:57.066 --> 14:58.333
You're right.

14:58.967 --> 15:01.900
And I must say
that helping always makes me feel better.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.300
You want to come?

15:03.367 --> 15:06.867
No. I have to figure out
which traditional St. Olaf party games

15:06.934 --> 15:08.867
to play at Blanche's party.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.133
Party?

15:11.467 --> 15:15.400
Is that why you've been trying
to find out my age?

15:15.467 --> 15:16.467
I forbid it.

15:16.533 --> 15:19.533
Blanche, a party is a celebration of life.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.633
It's not just for you
but for your friends.

15:22.700 --> 15:23.700
No.

15:23.767 --> 15:27.500
Stop being so vain.
You can't stay 42 forever.

15:27.567 --> 15:28.800
Yes, you can.

15:30.266 --> 15:33.033
If you eat right, exercise regularly,

15:33.100 --> 15:35.200
and live with women who look a lot older
than you.

15:41.033 --> 15:46.300
Tell me, Rose, is "kill the bitch"
a traditional St. Olaf party game?

15:47.600 --> 15:51.734
(calm music playing)

15:51.800 --> 15:55.767
No, Mrs. Ferguson,
I didn't see <i>Ed Sullivan</i> last night,

15:55.834 --> 15:59.066
but I'm sure it was a good one.
She's ready, God.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.166
That bell is you, Fluffy.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.700
Jimmy...

16:11.500 --> 16:12.533
Jimmy.

16:14.734 --> 16:17.266
Jimmy, I just want to make sure
that you're ok.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.066
Do I have to play hardball?

16:22.900 --> 16:25.166
-David Dillinger.
-Don't do this to me.

16:25.233 --> 16:28.100
-Bobby Feale.
-It's getting warm in here.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.467
-Tom Hayden.
-Oh, God, you're good.

16:30.767 --> 16:32.266
-Abbie--
-Ok.

16:32.734 --> 16:35.033
Just come on in here, you.

16:35.700 --> 16:36.867
What do you want?

16:37.400 --> 16:38.633
I don't understand you.

16:38.700 --> 16:43.000
I see a perfectly healthy, intelligent
person living like this, alone.

16:43.066 --> 16:44.166
I'm not alone.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.066
I've got my fish.

16:46.567 --> 16:49.867
Fish don't reject you, and fish don't
judge you, and fish...

16:52.400 --> 16:53.867
you got to feed fish.

16:55.233 --> 16:57.433
Jimmy, you deserve more.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.233
I thought I found it, but you dumped me.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.934
I bet you've broken hundreds of hearts
in your day, huh? Thousands.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.967
Well... yes, I have.

17:09.266 --> 17:11.133
I mean, wherever you go,

17:11.567 --> 17:16.233
I bet you torment and tease and tantalize
every man you meet.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.500
You're right again.

17:18.333 --> 17:22.667
Jimmy, we're getting away from the point.
You are missing the point.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.667
You are missing life.
You are missing people,

17:25.734 --> 17:28.734
people who are happy,
people who are in love--

17:28.800 --> 17:31.300
people who are towing my car away?

17:33.100 --> 17:37.266
I'd loan you my auto club card,
but it's really expired.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.133
Maybe you're right. Maybe I can't help.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.300
You need professional help.
I hope someday you get it.

17:43.367 --> 17:45.266
Don't you think I want to go with you?

17:46.200 --> 17:50.934
I look out that window
and see the happy couples walking by.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.767
People walking into the supermarket.

17:52.834 --> 17:55.900
You want me to get on a bus
and see a counselor?

17:56.367 --> 17:58.734
I can't even shop for my own food.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.367
What I wouldn't give
just to make my own dinner once.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.333
Actually, brunch is what I miss the most.

18:08.433 --> 18:12.400
Aw, Jimmy, come on,
let's take that extra step today

18:12.467 --> 18:16.000
and go to that supermarket.
You won't be sorry.

18:16.066 --> 18:19.734
Jimmy, the world is filled with wonderful
and exciting people.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.300
I'll take your suggestion,

18:21.367 --> 18:23.533
I'll play the Jackie Mason
tapes at half speed,

18:23.600 --> 18:26.066
but I really don't think
I'll hear anything.

18:27.934 --> 18:33.533
(mellow music playing)

18:37.266 --> 18:41.533
-I can't do it.
-You've come this far.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.233
-Do I have to?
-You're at a crossroads.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.700
Your next step could be
the most important one of your life.

18:48.033 --> 18:53.033
You trust me. Make that step.
Come on. Come on.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.600
-(Sophia) Come on.
-(Dorothy) Please.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.667
(sirens blaring)

19:03.767 --> 19:06.967
Congratulations.
You're our 1 millionth customer

19:07.033 --> 19:10.367
and winner of an all-expense-paid trip
to Mardi Gras!

19:10.433 --> 19:13.767
(screaming)

19:13.834 --> 19:18.734
(serene music playing)

19:21.934 --> 19:23.800
Blanche, where have you been?

19:23.867 --> 19:27.133
I've been out walking.
Today was my birthday.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.166
-Blanche--
-Don't start your yammering.

19:29.233 --> 19:33.300
It was one of the best
birthdays I've ever had.

19:33.367 --> 19:36.967
It occurred to me
that I'm a vibrant, energetic woman.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.166
I must still have life left in me

19:39.233 --> 19:42.200
if I can make Mel Bushman's head
snap back like that.

19:43.066 --> 19:44.567
You mean old Pez head?

19:46.900 --> 19:48.934
You were right. What's in a number?

19:49.266 --> 19:53.533
I still have my health
and my challenging career at the museum.

19:53.967 --> 19:57.000
Most of all, I have you all, my family.

19:57.066 --> 20:01.133
Oh, that birthday nonsense
was just an exercise in vanity.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.500
And, so, today, for the very first time...

20:06.133 --> 20:10.333
Blanche Devereaux is going to reveal
her true and accurate age.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.500
Right after you tell me your weight.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.166
-119.
-42.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.700
-Coffee?
-Please.

20:22.633 --> 20:26.066
-Dorothy, now, calm down.
-Oh, Ma. How can I?

20:26.133 --> 20:29.266
-What, Dorothy? What's wrong?
-I'll tell you what's wrong.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.066
I single-handedly ruined a man's life
today.

20:32.133 --> 20:34.000
-Which hand?
-This hand!

20:35.233 --> 20:38.300
What difference does it make what hand?
I ruined him.

20:38.367 --> 20:42.500
-(doorbell rings)
-I played with fire, and I lost.

20:44.967 --> 20:47.533
-Jimmy.
-You forgot your sweater, Dorothy.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.467
Come in.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.400
-How did you get here?
-I walked.

20:53.734 --> 20:58.033
Well, I'd like you to meet my roommates
Rose and Blanche.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.967
Would you like us to--

21:00.033 --> 21:02.567
No, no. I got to start
getting used to people.

21:03.133 --> 21:07.000
Dorothy, you should know
that when I got back to my place,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.633
I did some thinking.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.433
Actually, I did some shaking
and then some thinking.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.300
I realized I was alone again.

21:13.367 --> 21:16.367
After meeting you,
I don't want to be alone.

21:16.433 --> 21:22.633
If there's nice people like you out here,
maybe the world's not such a bad place.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.900
I know this isn't going to be easy,
but I want help.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.633
Help and new clothes.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.400
So, I'll go to a counselor,
if you'll drive me.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.300
Drive you? Are you kidding?
I'll listen to 8-tracks with you.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.400
Course we'll have to use Rose's car.

21:43.633 --> 21:49.133
-But whatever you want. I'm there for you.
-I'm so glad this worked out.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.900
-Come on in here. I'll fix some coffee.
-Great idea.

21:52.967 --> 21:55.767
I think I can make it
if I take it a little at a time.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.433
Yeah, sure you can!

21:59.200 --> 22:02.300
-(people yell surprise!)
-Oh! Oh!

22:02.367 --> 22:04.200
Rose, I'm going to kill you.

22:07.266 --> 22:10.266
Rose, this is just a great party.

22:10.333 --> 22:14.834
And the perfect gift.
How'd you know what I needed?

22:14.900 --> 22:18.467
Oh, you. Come here, you.

22:24.600 --> 22:31.533
(theme music playing)
