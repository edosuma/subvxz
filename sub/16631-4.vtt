WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.786
- Stop that!
Please stop!

00:09.480 --> 00:12.529
I wanted to thank you.
We never properly met.

00:12.570 --> 00:14.174
I'm Kate Andrews.

00:14.230 --> 00:15.913
- Leon Riley.

00:15.970 --> 00:18.268
- [Tank]: She's a
firecracker, that one.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.483
- This war is the best thing
that ever happened to us.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.269
- Writing letters
to your own kids?

00:23.320 --> 00:25.311
- Could you tell
them Daddy died?

00:25.370 --> 00:28.669
- You could copy out what
she's written, cost you nothing.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.190
- I know you have a decent
heart beating in there.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.548
[Thunder]

00:33.590 --> 00:36.673
- I'll walk
home by myself.

00:36.730 --> 00:39.631
- All eyes will be on this
wedding, waiting for scandal.

00:39.690 --> 00:41.988
- Who cares what
people think?

00:42.040 --> 00:43.598
- When you occupy
the top shelf,

00:43.650 --> 00:45.299
people are eager
to drag you down.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.954
- Your fianc?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.082
- I need to know
what's going on.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.301
- I think you do.

00:56.570 --> 00:57.741
- [Lorna]:
That's good.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.519
[Woman laughing]

01:00.880 --> 01:02.529
- Come on, girls,
let's hustle!

01:02.580 --> 01:04.229
- We worked
through lunch.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.316
- Here.
- There's still a slew to go!

01:06.370 --> 01:08.235
- [Man]:
Coming through!

01:10.110 --> 01:11.884
- Only 53 before we build

01:11.940 --> 01:14.101
Victory Munitions'
millionth bomb!

01:14.160 --> 01:15.843
- We won't make it
before shift-end.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.767
- The Red Shift tarts
look down their noses at us.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.539
If they get the glory
instead of us,

01:20.600 --> 01:21.942
we won't hear
the end of it.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.469
- You think they
stand a chance?

01:23.510 --> 01:25.296
- With minutes
before shift's over?

01:25.340 --> 01:26.329
I don't think so.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.688
- You're probably right.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.549
Blue Shift ain't
the strongest.

01:30.610 --> 01:31.736
- Mmm-mm!

01:35.050 --> 01:38.042
Ladies, let's build
some bombs!

01:38.090 --> 01:39.614
- Whoo!

01:39.660 --> 01:42.094
- Mrs. Corbett?
- What a trooper!

01:42.140 --> 01:43.744
- You girls stand chance now.

01:43.790 --> 01:45.223
- I'm collapsing
when it's over.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.090
- No collapsing for me.
I'm coming back

01:47.150 --> 01:49.311
for movie night,
I even booked a sitter.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.667
- Be nice to see you out.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.109
- I figure if I keep smiling,

01:52.150 --> 01:53.583
one day I might feel like it.

01:53.630 --> 01:56.497
Bring that husband of yours.
I'd like to meet him.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.063
- Bob's not big on crowds.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.283
- If our shift makes it,
we get to be

02:00.330 --> 02:02.594
in the newsreel
they're makIng.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.858
- They better not
be filming me.

02:07.340 --> 02:09.558
- You know, I once made
love to a woman

02:09.600 --> 02:11.249
without even
touching her,

02:11.300 --> 02:14.554
_ _but even I can't shoot the
millionth bomb from way up here.

02:14.610 --> 02:17.306
- But one spark from
your cameras, Mr. Joseph,

02:17.350 --> 02:19.568
the whole factory
could blow sky-high.

02:19.610 --> 02:21.396
- Only 25 bombs away.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.874
- 976...

02:23.920 --> 02:27.048
- This is like shooting
goldfish in a swimming pool.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.920
- Workers' safety
comes first.

02:28.970 --> 02:31.791
- Fine, then let me shoot on
Sunday when the line is down.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.535
I need women rushing
from theatres

02:33.580 --> 02:34.797
to join
the war machine.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.499
- Only 20 to go.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.145
- Don't you want to excite
the nation's ladies?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.929
- 982...

02:40.980 --> 02:42.629
983...

02:42.680 --> 02:45.456
- Cordite, amatol...
they're explosives.

02:45.510 --> 02:49.241
- We'll use dummy materials.
No risk. Just get me down there.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.508
- Sir, Blue Shift is
getting very close!

02:51.560 --> 02:54.336
- Fantastic! We start the story
in the thick of things.

02:54.390 --> 02:57.644
You stay wide.
I'll peg off the details.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.918
And there's
our poster-girl.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.520
- Come on, ladies.
- 998...

03:07.570 --> 03:09.913
- Oh, we're so close!

03:09.970 --> 03:11.574
- Can't believe_
we're gonna do It!

03:11.620 --> 03:13.702
- 999...

03:13.750 --> 03:17.095
Ladies and gents,
may I present...

03:17.150 --> 03:20.233
[Buzzer sounding]

03:20.280 --> 03:23.886
Victory Munitions'
millionth bomb!

03:23.940 --> 03:25.328
[Cheers]

03:28.030 --> 03:31.375
- I knew you'd come
through in a pinch.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.115
- You did wonderful.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.115
[Giggling]

03:34.170 --> 03:35.853
Very good. Good job.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.423
- Lorna!_
Congratulations.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.119
_You like
provmg me wrong.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.728
- Not at all.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.738
I'm sure the girls would have
done just fine without me.

03:43.780 --> 03:44.917
They're a good group.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.394
- We'll sure have a
fun shindig tonight.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.965
- They said the Blues
couldn't do it, but we did!

03:54.010 --> 03:56.444
- Oh dear.
Hold your fire.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.185
- When I think of
her with James...

03:58.230 --> 04:00.050
- Keep walking, Gladys.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.273
- You already
have it all.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.709
You gotta take the millionth
bomb from the Reds too?

04:04.760 --> 04:07.365
Who's the thief now?

04:07.420 --> 04:09.547
- At least I earn my
pin money standing up.

04:09.590 --> 04:10.898
- Have a good
shift, Hazel.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.589
- You know,
you swan around here

04:12.640 --> 04:15.074
like you're the poster-girl
for a happy engagement.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.816
But ask yourself, if your
fianc loves you so much,

04:17.860 --> 04:19.771
why'd he come
wandering my way?

04:19.820 --> 04:21.333
- Don't!

04:21.390 --> 04:23.813
Don't. You're
better than that.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.950
[Projector clicking]

04:34.010 --> 04:36.046
[Dmm]

04:40.010 --> 04:43.889
- [Man]: Lancasters and Halifaxes rain allied firepower

04:45.320 --> 04:47.663
Allied forces
have repulsed the siege,

04:47.720 --> 04:51.588
to maintain full control of the strategic city of Tobruk...

04:51.630 --> 04:54.098
- That could be your
son bombing Tobruk.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.936
- And bullets
coming back at him.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.208
- In North Africa,

04:59.250 --> 05:02.037
Allied forces are
taking it to Jerry...

05:02.080 --> 05:04.947
- Your Bob seems to know
a lot about our combats.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.423
The letters he writes
my kids are so real.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.686
-Hmm.

05:08.740 --> 05:11.345
- It's like he's
over there.

05:13.310 --> 05:15.608
Last war.

05:15.660 --> 05:18.299
Here's his latest scribbles
for your children.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.263
- Tell him thanks.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.309
-Hmm.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.487
- Must be nice
for your sons,

05:24.540 --> 05:26.838
having his letters
to lean on.

05:28.540 --> 05:32.499
- Yes. It's a real comfort.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.326
- ...keep fighting as they have,

05:34.370 --> 05:35.974
we have every reason
to believe

05:36.030 --> 05:38.248
that North Africa
will soon belong

05:38.290 --> 05:40.724
to its gallant defenders.

05:40.770 --> 05:43.728
German forces are beginning
to learn a hard lesson

05:43.770 --> 05:45.909
that once given
a chance to fight...

05:45.950 --> 05:48.942
- So, I bought a Billie Holiday
record like you suggested.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.867
She's aces. Could you teach me
how she does her phrasing?

05:51.910 --> 05:54.640
It's like she's talking
more than singing.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.999
- Until you been loved
and left like Billie...

05:59.400 --> 06:02.005
I doubt I could
teach you a thing.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.836
I'm gonna
get some corn.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.407
- Are we listening
to the same record?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.839
'Cause I hear a lady
singing: "Don't judge me."

06:09.890 --> 06:12.757
We all have
our secrets.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.018
- [Man]: Picture starts
in a minute, folks.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.061
- I found my star.

06:17.110 --> 06:21.149
Russell Joseph,
your newsreel director.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.858
- Forget any
close-up, Mr. Joseph.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.891
I can't be in your
little movie.

06:26.950 --> 06:29.817
- Wait. You have an elusive
quality the camera would love.

06:29.860 --> 06:31.851
- Well, I'll be
elusive right now

06:31.910 --> 06:34.777
and tell you to find
another girl. Good night.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.209
- Rejection's easier to
take on a full stomach.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.478
Why don't you let me
take you to dinner, huh?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.954
- Two problems,
Russell Joseph.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.307
First, I'm engaged.

06:43.350 --> 06:45.693
And 2nd, my
mother told me never

06:45.750 --> 06:47.786
to go out with a man
with 2 first names.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.537
- [Man]: Up next, a sneak-peak
screening of Hitchcock's latest.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.754
- Is he still looking at me?
- He's eating you up with cream.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.529
With all the good
men off to war,

06:56.590 --> 06:59.058
we're left with nothing
but rogues and scoundrels.

06:59.110 --> 07:01.840
- Just my luck. I finally
have a shot at being a star

07:01.890 --> 07:03.938
and there's no way on
earth I can shine.

07:03.980 --> 07:05.891
- Sure, your father
would have a coronary

07:05.940 --> 07:07.988
if he found out you
work the factory floor.

07:08.030 --> 07:11.204
- Mother wouldn't be able to
show her face at the club again,

07:11.250 --> 07:12.774
which almost makes
it worth it.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.856
[Both chuckling]

07:14.910 --> 07:16.992
Come on, movie's
about to start.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.769
- Cary Grant
as a bad guy?

07:18.820 --> 07:19.775
[Scoffing]

07:19.830 --> 07:21.730
I just can't
fathom it.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.657
- You'd be surprised
what hides behind

07:25.700 --> 07:27.395
a good suit and
nice manners.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.567
- Looking for
someone?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.400
- Just keeping tabs.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.406
You did very
good work today.

07:35.450 --> 07:39.102
Rumour has it, Mr. Hollywood's
looking for a girl

07:39.150 --> 07:41.493
_ to feature
in his newsreel.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.496
- I'm hardly the
type of girl

07:43.550 --> 07:46.360
they want for those
things, Mrs. Corbett,

07:46.420 --> 07:48.581
which is fine by me.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.987
- Seems a shame.

07:52.030 --> 07:54.635
You're the best
worker we have.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.644
[Woman giggling]

08:01.480 --> 08:04.643
Let's keep it
civil, people.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.869
[Woman giggling]

08:18.840 --> 08:20.967
Upstairs, now.

08:23.020 --> 08:25.796
I should've known.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.806
- Did you come
looking for me?

08:27.850 --> 08:31.456
- I'm here to ensure my girls
are suitably chaperoned.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.898
That's my job.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.943
- Looks like I'm keeping
you in business, huh?

08:35.990 --> 08:38.550
- This is just a lark
for you, isn't it?

08:38.600 --> 08:42.297
- I was just distracting
myself, Lorna.

08:42.340 --> 08:46.299
The truth is, I can't stop
thinking about that kiss.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.519
- I will not be played
for a fool, Mr. Moretti.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.099
- Seeing the film,
all I could think of

08:57.140 --> 08:58.528
was James and
that floozy.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.741
Watching Joan Fontaine
almost die because

09:00.800 --> 09:03.621
she didn't have the courage
to confront Cary Grant,

09:03.670 --> 09:06.491
I couldn't help but think
I'm doing the same thing.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.588
- What in_ blazes are
you talking about?

09:08.630 --> 09:11.588
Tonight's movie,
Hitchcock's Suspicion.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.154
Were you watching
it at all?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.634
- I went outside
to smoke... often.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.410
- I'm just like Joan Fontaine,

09:18.470 --> 09:21.075
living in my wild imaginings.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.111
- So talk to
your fianc, Gladys,

09:23.170 --> 09:24.512
straighten things out.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.609
- Let's just say if we start

09:27.650 --> 09:29.823
throwing back the curtains,

09:29.870 --> 09:32.384
I'm going to be the one
with the sun in my eyes.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.863
- You got
something to hide?

09:34.920 --> 09:38.139
- It was a
little dalliance.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.307
- Gladys?

09:40.360 --> 09:42.783
- Aren't you the
dark horse!

09:42.840 --> 09:44.057
- Another man?

09:44.100 --> 09:46.091
- A sore deed. I--

09:46.150 --> 09:48.141
It was so foolish.

09:48.190 --> 09:49.794
- Oh my goodness!

09:49.850 --> 09:52.148
- An airman. I wanted
to be kind and get

09:52.200 --> 09:53.883
some experience
under my belt.

09:53.940 --> 09:55.840
- Other things too,
by the sound of it.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.801
- Bets, we didn't go
all the way.

09:57.850 --> 10:00.023
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

10:00.070 --> 10:03.289
- Trying to
figure that out.

10:03.340 --> 10:05.763
It's time to pay
your fianc a visit.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.029
- I'd tell you
how late it is,

10:15.090 --> 10:17.308
but I wager the
neighbours already had.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.786
- We saw Suspiciontonight.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.435
Jo_an Fontaine
marries Cary Grant,

10:23.490 --> 10:27.870
He's a complete charmer who
turns out to be a callous rake.

10:27.930 --> 10:32.185
He gambles, he drinks,
betrays his friends.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.708
- It's hard to imagine
Cary Grant as a cad.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.139
- He's good at it,
surprisingly so.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.324
He does such awful things,

10:41.370 --> 10:44.544
his wife wonders if
he ever truly loved her.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.763
-_Go on. You're
saVIng me 25 cents.

10:47.820 --> 10:51.074
- And Joan, she loves
him so much...

10:51.120 --> 10:52.906
- Gladys, what's wrong?

10:54.610 --> 10:58.694
- The point is, she never
really knew the man she loves.

10:58.740 --> 11:02.119
He had this whole other
life and she had no idea.

11:02.180 --> 11:04.398
And I can't do that,
James. I need to know.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.614
- I am an open
book, darling.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.743
- It seems another girl's
been thumbing the pages.

11:14.230 --> 11:16.619
Do you love her?

11:16.670 --> 11:18.319
- I don't know
who you mean...

11:18.370 --> 11:19.883
- Hazel McDougall.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.750
Does that jog
your memory?

11:25.200 --> 11:28.727
Please don't lie.
It'll only hurt worse.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.112
Why would you do this?

11:30.160 --> 11:33.038
Why would you risk everything
if you don't love her?

11:33.080 --> 11:35.423
- It's not gonna
happen again.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.426
- I'm just supposed
to believe you?

11:37.470 --> 11:38.641
- Yes!

11:40.000 --> 11:43.254
And digging this up,
you're making a mistake.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.258
- I guess I'm
allowed a few.

11:48.310 --> 11:50.744
Let's not wake
the neighbours.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.746
[Sniffling]

11:52.790 --> 11:54.439
Good night.

11:57.230 --> 11:58.492
[Door closing]

12:01.020 --> 12:02.100
- Every picture night,

12:02.150 --> 12:03.367
workers sneak down here,

12:03.410 --> 12:04.672
get up to God-knows-what.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.449
I've seen more
French letters here

12:06.500 --> 12:07.717
than a Parisian postman.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.419
- Well, what are
we gonna do,

12:09.460 --> 12:12.418
have all the girls try these
on like Cinderella's slipper?

12:12.470 --> 12:15.200
- We work hard to train and
mold our girls into workers

12:15.250 --> 12:17.241
who will help
win this war.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.906
After all that, do you want
to lose them to pregnancy?

12:20.950 --> 12:23.168
- We can't chaperone
them every minute.

12:23.220 --> 12:26.769
- We could write up some rules,
an employee code of conduct.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.958
- Oh for God's sake! I'll put
some rubbers in the men's room.

12:30.010 --> 12:33.309
- This newsreel is going to
attract hundreds of new workers,

12:33.360 --> 12:35.009
vulnerable girls
far from home.

12:35.050 --> 12:37.792
Without rules, that's--
It's a recipe for disaster.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.445
- You can't fight
human nature, Lorna.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.879
- We can certainly try.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.795
[Chuckles]

12:48.200 --> 12:51.363
- Your blood-work shows
no remaining infection,

12:51.420 --> 12:53.456
so this is our
last treatment.

12:53.510 --> 12:56.547
You're lucky to
have connections

12:56.600 --> 12:58.761
to access this new
drug, penICIllin.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.334
We've seen
good results.

13:01.380 --> 13:06.818
But in the future, you may want
to make use of prophylactics.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.122
While they
diminish pleasure,

13:09.170 --> 13:11.513
they also eliminate
pain here afterwards.

13:11.570 --> 13:14.471
- Is the lecture part-and-parcel
with the humiliation?

13:14.530 --> 13:17.260
- You're an educated man,
Mr. Dunn, yet here we are.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.299
Trousers.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.229
- Apologies.

13:21.270 --> 13:24.398
It was want of an education
that led me here.

13:24.450 --> 13:26.406
This was all
some idiotic attempt

13:26.450 --> 13:28.839
to prepare myself
for my wedding night.

13:28.890 --> 13:31.711
- You feel the man should
be more experienced.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.365
- I expect my fianc
will appreciate it

13:34.420 --> 13:35.717
when the time comes.

13:35.770 --> 13:39.149
- Young women these days
can be more sophisticated

13:39.200 --> 13:40.462
than you think.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.330
- Not Gladys.
She's an innocent.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.938
[Groans]

13:43.990 --> 13:46.641
- I tell you,
Gladys Witham's our girl.

13:46.690 --> 13:49.602
Come on, a socialite
working the bomb line?

13:49.650 --> 13:52.471
It's Holleood perfect.
Plus she's a stunner.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.784
Working here, Harold,
you're a lucky man.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.730
- I'm not certain
she wants the job.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.655
- Yeah, well, if she
wants to work here,

13:58.700 --> 14:00.133
she'll do her
patriotic duty.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.876
- Well, that's settled. Now
let's talk about the schedule.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.922
I suggest we
start the day--

14:04.970 --> 14:06.744
- Gladys is a
wonderful choice.

14:08.450 --> 14:11.101
- There it is,
a ringing endorsement.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.539
- Of course, I practically
have to say that,

14:13.590 --> 14:15.069
because she's
my best friend.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.192
Gladys is
terrifically sincere,

14:17.240 --> 14:19.800
it's just she might
put off a working girl.

14:19.850 --> 14:23.024
And besides, her family
wouldn't like it.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.118
- She is a little on
her high horse.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.809
- I found her
approachable.

14:26.860 --> 14:32.207
- Just because you'd like to
get her out of that uniform

14:32.260 --> 14:35.127
and into your little movie,

14:35.170 --> 14:38.219
doesn't mean the average
girl will see her

14:38.260 --> 14:39.864
and think: "That's me."

14:39.920 --> 14:41.820
- Madam, I've been
making newsreels

14:41.880 --> 14:44.610
since Hitler strolled
through the Sudetenland, OK?

14:44.660 --> 14:45.911
I know how to
sell this war.

14:45.970 --> 14:48.700
- To men, maybe.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.184
- She's right.

14:51.230 --> 14:52.572
Much as it pains me,

14:52.630 --> 14:54.757
I gotta stop
you here, Russell.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.404
They're our
target audience.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.545
This time, we listen
to the ladies.

15:02.980 --> 15:06.984
- I expect you have
a suggestion, Matron?

15:08.290 --> 15:10.167
- Mm-hmm.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.776
- Swing it, shake it,
don't put up a fight

15:20.830 --> 15:22.957
Train's leaving tonight

15:23.000 --> 15:26.083
- Miss Andrews,
get out of here!

15:28.100 --> 15:30.967
- So I'm not the best
Singer in the world,

15:31.010 --> 15:34.184
but hey, that's no reason
to throw me the cold shoulder.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.881
- You think your singing's
why I won't talk with you?

15:36.930 --> 15:39.057
- No, I think it's
because I'm not...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.805
like you.

15:42.850 --> 15:46.638
And I'm just telling you,
I don't give a hoot.

15:46.680 --> 15:50.764
- Truth is, I can't be
seen with someone who...

15:50.810 --> 15:52.858
sings from her neck.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.242
[Chuckling]

15:54.300 --> 15:55.949
- That is where
my throat is.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.208
- But that ain't
where the song is.

15:58.260 --> 15:59.989
You're keeping
it trapped up

16:00.040 --> 16:02.122
in that little
box up there,

16:02.170 --> 16:05.253
when the feeling
comes from here,

16:05.310 --> 16:06.527
and you power it...

16:06.570 --> 16:08.299
[Inhaling]

16:08.350 --> 16:10.818
....from here.

16:13.180 --> 16:17.219
- Swing it, shake it
Don't put up a fight

16:17.280 --> 16:19.145
- Leon!

16:19.190 --> 16:22.318
I asked you to
oversee clean-up.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.801
- Yes, sir.
Spic-and-span.

16:30.770 --> 16:35.981
- It's awful, the things
folks get up to down here.

16:45.090 --> 16:48.173
- I managed to croak
out Hazel's name,

16:48.220 --> 16:51.007
and_James insisted
it was over.

16:51.050 --> 16:53.302
And then I ran before
the walls caved in.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.828
- Did you tell him
about your airman?

16:55.880 --> 16:58.701
- I couldn't. It's
a double-standard.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.537
Men get to bring home
the bride to dear, old Mom,

17:01.580 --> 17:04.799
and then run around back with
a no-account factory girl.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.580
But if we did
the same thing...

17:06.630 --> 17:08.359
- Me?

17:08.410 --> 17:09.752
- You're the
one they chose.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.971
- It's a practical joke.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.373
- You'll be a
role model, Betty.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.069
If we want
good workers,

17:16.120 --> 17:19.556
we need to show them
what one looks like.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.552
- You're the Victory
Munitions girl?

17:24.600 --> 17:25.862
- It's the perfect choice.

17:25.910 --> 17:27.639
- How fun!
They'll film you Sunday

17:27.690 --> 17:30.989
and before you know it,
you'll be on the silver screen.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.779
You wait, Betty.

17:34.570 --> 17:36.526
They're all gonna
see what I see:

17:36.570 --> 17:38.652
A hero.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.665
- Lorna, I've been
thinking you're right.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.759
Men and women all cooped here
the way we got them,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.313
the place
is a tinderbox.

17:49.370 --> 17:51.452
Go ahead with your
code of conduct.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.195
- That--that's wonderful.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.060
- Just a brochure
kind of thing.

17:55.110 --> 17:57.249
All the do's
and dont's.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.281
- Who should I get
to write it?

17:59.330 --> 18:00.672
- You.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.413
- Sir, I'm no writer.

18:02.470 --> 18:05.166
- Yeah, but you
did marry young,

18:05.210 --> 18:06.905
and I'm sure
you know a lot

18:06.950 --> 18:09.123
about the pitfalls
of budding love.

18:15.310 --> 18:16.254
[Giggling]

18:16.310 --> 18:17.607
- Now I warn you,

18:17.660 --> 18:20.128
you're up against
some stiff competition.

18:20.180 --> 18:23.525
Lorna gets her potatoes
fluffier than a goose's arse.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.524
[Laughing]

18:24.580 --> 18:26.536
- Gotta say,
I sweated it a bit.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.571
With all you've
done for my kids,

18:28.620 --> 18:30.269
a casserole isn't much.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.403
- No, I'd say
it's a fine trade.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.928
- Those are beautiful.

18:35.980 --> 18:39.154
- I paint some toys for
a couple of shops uptown.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.509
- Your kids sure must have
loved that growing up.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.802
- They got the ones
that didn't turn out right.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.815
- Well, you're giving
my Skip and Daphne

18:47.860 --> 18:49.908
a real gift with
those letters.

18:49.950 --> 18:53.033
They say it's like having
their daddy back home with them.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.516
- I gotta tell you,
Mrs. McCallum,

18:56.570 --> 18:59.437
it doesn't sit well
With me some days.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.175
I mean, it seems
kind of cruel,

19:01.220 --> 19:03.950
to keep pretending
that their father's alive.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.171
- Telling them
the truth, I--

19:08.580 --> 19:10.662
I'm afraid of what
it'll do to them.

19:12.490 --> 19:15.493
- Well, if I'm gonna
write to them,

19:15.540 --> 19:17.883
it would help to
know what they like.

19:17.930 --> 19:20.888
- Lately?
Kites at Willow Park.

19:20.940 --> 19:24.239
Skip likes to pretend it's
his daddy up there flying.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.190
- What a day.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.765
All I asked was for management
to set down some simple rules

19:29.820 --> 19:31.629
to keep the girls
out of trouble,

19:31.690 --> 19:34.113
and old Snaky Akins
has me writing it.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.467
Edith!

19:35.520 --> 19:37.078
- Lorna, hello!

19:37.130 --> 19:38.518
- She brought supper.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.209
- You were working late

19:40.260 --> 19:43.081
and I had this Shepherd's
Pie with no takers.

19:43.130 --> 19:45.212
- That was very
thoughtful of you, Edith.

19:45.270 --> 19:46.919
- Sit down, Lorna.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.303
- Let me get you a plate.
You've had a long day.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.873
- No, I'm not that hungry.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.878
- Don't be shy.
I'm not taking any home.

19:53.930 --> 19:56.057
- It's a forkful of magic.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.458
- Can we just leave?

20:06.500 --> 20:09.549
- Not if we want Reverend
Fletcher for the wedding.

20:09.590 --> 20:11.501
He takes these
lessons seriously.

20:11.550 --> 20:12.505
- Will you?

20:12.550 --> 20:15.815
- You don't understand.

20:15.860 --> 20:18.294
- I know you must have felt
something for Hazel.

20:18.340 --> 20:20.604
Otherwise, why would you
have been with her?

20:20.650 --> 20:22.299
- For the experience, Gladys.

20:22.350 --> 20:24.124
I can't show up
on our wedding night

20:24.170 --> 20:25.125
with hardly a clue.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.306
I met Hazel months ago.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.261
- And what, she was
your education?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.652
- In a manner
of speaking.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.430
- Why not come to me?

20:32.490 --> 20:34.264
- Gladys...

20:34.320 --> 20:37.187
- What? Because I'm not
that kind of girl?

20:37.230 --> 20:40.757
- That kind of girl gets around,
and a girl who gets around

20:40.800 --> 20:43.189
leaves her fellows
unfortunate souvenirs.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.405
- Hazel McDougall
gave you the clap?

20:46.460 --> 20:50.282
- Shhh! I've taken a cure.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.761
- I'm still a virgin, if
that's what you're asking!

20:55.810 --> 20:58.290
- Of course you're
still a virgin!

20:58.340 --> 21:01.559
Now, I've supported you working
the factory, making new friends.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.036
And you think I liked that?
No. But I love you.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.469
You can't cherry-pick
what suits you, Gladys.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.139
- Sure is strange

21:14.180 --> 21:15.829
being in here
on a Sunday.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.519
- OK, gals, gals! Hustle your
cabooses into place here.

21:18.580 --> 21:21.401
Now, remember, never,
ever look at the camera.

21:21.450 --> 21:23.839
- I'm gonna look.
I just know I'm gonna look.

21:23.890 --> 21:25.573
- Edith, get ahold
of yourself.

21:25.630 --> 21:28.326
- Rudy Valentino here has
replaced the cordite with--

21:28.370 --> 21:29.928
What is that?
String?

21:29.980 --> 21:31.197
- Uncooked spaghetti, sir.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.105
- That'll stop the
place from exploding?

21:33.160 --> 21:34.411
- Oh!

21:34.460 --> 21:36.246
Who's gonna
defuse Betty?

21:36.290 --> 21:38.542
She's got enough powder on
to blow us slq high.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.851
- [Woman]:
Whoo-hoo! Betty!

21:39.900 --> 21:41.333
[Whistling]

21:41.380 --> 21:42.460
- Shut it, Moretti.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.649
- Betty, you look
like a movie star.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.942
- No, I look like a clown.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.869
- You'll see under the lights,
it'll look like nothing.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.958
- You got the whole system
here backwards!

21:54.000 --> 21:56.048
- I got shots
to match, Killer.

21:56.090 --> 21:59.389
Take a deep breath.
OK, positions, ladies!

22:01.710 --> 22:03.268
All, right,
pan that over...

22:03.320 --> 22:05.220
- Amazing how they
take something fake

22:05.280 --> 22:07.145
and make it look
like something real.

22:07.190 --> 22:10.364
- There is nothing real about
turning our girls into sexpots.

22:10.410 --> 22:12.844
All the more reason to
have a code of conduct.

22:12.890 --> 22:15.757
I give my draft to
Mr. Akins today.

22:20.810 --> 22:22.459
- They set
back there?

22:23.900 --> 22:25.765
OK, stand by
to do a take.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.242
Roll camera...

22:28.860 --> 22:30.908
and action!

22:33.650 --> 22:35.470
That's it, that's it.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.784
OK, now...

22:40.310 --> 22:44.701
That's it, stuff that bomb like
you're slapping Hitler's face!

22:45.970 --> 22:48.006
Good.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.279
Now smile like you
love being here.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.537
Good, perfection.
And cut!

22:53.800 --> 22:56.667
OK, time for the close up.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.540
Now, let's bring in
that hand double.

22:58.590 --> 23:00.638
- This is my moment.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.284
[Giggling]

23:02.330 --> 23:05.060
- Your hands look
nothing like mine!

23:05.120 --> 23:06.542
- That's the point, Killer.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.636
All right,
roll camera.

23:08.690 --> 23:11.250
- Kissing, I can see,
but holding hands?

23:11.300 --> 23:13.814
- It's not appropriate
workplace behaviour.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.998
You'll see the fine incurred
is con5iderably smaller.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.122
- "Frottage." Do I even
know what that is?

23:19.180 --> 23:22.263
- Men rub up against the
girls in the canteen line-up.

23:22.310 --> 23:24.266
- I gotta say,
this policy reads

23:24.310 --> 23:27.097
like the best bits of
Lady Chatterley's Lover.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.870
We'll have to circulate
your little publication

23:29.930 --> 23:31.352
in a plain, brown wrapper.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.617
- I merely catalogued
what happens here.

23:33.670 --> 23:35.570
- Well, you've
certainly done right

23:35.630 --> 23:37.586
by all the ways
men do wrong.

23:37.630 --> 23:39.848
But let's keep
it simple, Lorna.

23:39.890 --> 23:44.020
Let's focus on curtailing
the private pursuits

23:44.070 --> 23:46.118
in storerooms, tunnels.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.469
- [Russell]:
That's it, girls!

23:50.510 --> 23:53.559
Now give it
your all, Killer!

23:53.600 --> 23:57.297
This is for the
newsreel's big capper.

23:58.610 --> 24:00.214
More joy.

24:01.650 --> 24:02.958
Big smile.

24:04.350 --> 24:05.305
Cut! Cut, cut.

24:05.350 --> 24:06.999
- I feel like an idiot!

24:07.050 --> 24:09.484
- No, no. You are welcoming
us into your home.

24:09.530 --> 24:11.134
It'll make sense
in the edit.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.738
- I_|ive in a
rooming house.

24:12.790 --> 24:16.180
- Your little hovel wouldn't
draw one girl out of her barn.

24:16.230 --> 24:17.788
We're selling
the dream here.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.829
That's you, doll.

24:20.370 --> 24:22.179
Fix her lipstick,
could ya?

24:22.240 --> 24:23.582
- Yeah.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.359
- OK, guys,
we're gonna go again.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.456
And make sure
we keep the pan wide...

24:27.500 --> 24:29.195
- This whole thing
is a cock-up.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.638
- You'll see.

24:30.680 --> 24:34.207
Once you're on screen,
you'll look like a natural.

24:35.470 --> 24:36.812
OK?

24:36.860 --> 24:38.031
[Chuckling
sarcastically]

24:38.080 --> 24:39.069
OK.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.076
- Isn't it beautiful?

24:41.130 --> 24:43.121
Imagine living here.

24:43.170 --> 24:46.776
- Yeah, I do, actually.

24:46.830 --> 24:50.300
I've been saving
for a place like this

24:50.350 --> 24:52.784
since I started working.

24:52.830 --> 24:55.139
- Why? That's what
husbands are for.

24:55.180 --> 24:57.967
- Didn't you ever want
something of your own?

24:58.010 --> 25:00.444
- We settled down some
Winters, shared rooms.

25:00.490 --> 25:02.879
- I had blankets
hung across a corner

25:02.930 --> 25:05.012
and too many brothers
for bunk-mates.

25:05.060 --> 25:07.403
I'd just dream of
a place of my own.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.143
And now,
thanks to the war,

25:09.200 --> 25:12.021
I stand a chance
of getting it.

25:12.070 --> 25:14.504
Maybe I should send a
thank-you card to Hitler.

25:14.550 --> 25:15.676
- Betty!

25:15.730 --> 25:16.674
[Giggling]

25:16.730 --> 25:20.109
- Of course,
I'd need house-mates.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.511
Or at least one.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.516
- You're on.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.514
- Places, Betty, please.

25:30.650 --> 25:33.949
I regret that you're stuck
behind the camera, Miss Witham,

25:34.010 --> 25:37.138
but the feeling was that
you came off supra populi,

25:37.180 --> 25:39.569
"above the people".

25:39.620 --> 25:42.794
- You're quoting Latin
and I'm the snob?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.888
- You could always
lower your standards

25:44.930 --> 25:46.579
and debate this
over a drink.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.621
- I'm still engaged,
Mr. Joseph.

25:48.670 --> 25:51.753
- So I keep hearing.

25:51.810 --> 25:54.108
- Wait for it, Skip!
Gotta get a good gust here.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.639
[Chuckling]

25:55.680 --> 25:57.193
Go!

25:58.640 --> 26:00.858
Oh! Ah!

26:04.650 --> 26:07.460
- You gotta pull down
on the string, son, hard.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.340
- But I don't want
it to crash!

26:09.390 --> 26:11.563
- No, go ahead, son,
do what he tells you.

26:15.350 --> 26:17.784
- Whoa, Mommy!
It's working! Look!

26:17.830 --> 26:20.833
- You give that kite a tug,
you tell it who's boss,

26:22.450 --> 26:25.135
- Well, isn't
this a surprise!

26:25.190 --> 26:27.408
[Chuckling]

26:29.020 --> 26:31.580
I hope Lorna was OK
with me dropping by.

26:31.630 --> 26:33.234
I did feel
rather awkward.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.408
- Aw, she's fine. One less
meal she's gotta make.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.496
Where's your little girl?

26:38.550 --> 26:40.108
- My neighbour
and her little girl

26:40.160 --> 26:41.639
took her along
to the pictures.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.023
She's dying
to see Dumbo.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.889
- Skip here needs
to run wild.

26:45.950 --> 26:47.554
- My boys were the same.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.555
[Chuckles]

26:48.600 --> 26:50.124
- And how are they now?

26:50.170 --> 26:53.253
Your letters must be
a real comfort to them.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.909
- Haven't written them yet.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.861
Well, I think he's
got the hang of it.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.081
- You know, I'm up
most nights thinking

27:02.140 --> 27:04.529
of all the things
I never told my husband.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.263
Don't wait, Bob.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.884
[Chuckles]

27:15.890 --> 27:18.404
- My daddy's in the war.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.849
Did you kill Germans too?

27:20.900 --> 27:22.106
-SHp!

27:22.160 --> 27:23.889
- Yes, I did.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.635
- Except they hurt you back.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.459
[Skip imitating gunshots]

27:31.510 --> 27:33.296
I'm a Spitfire airplane!

27:33.340 --> 27:34.557
[Chuckling]

27:39.520 --> 27:42.045
- You ready to
talk to me now?

27:42.090 --> 27:44.308
- We've done that.

27:45.570 --> 27:47.390
All those nights
at the lake,

27:47.440 --> 27:49.260
railing against
our parents,

27:49.310 --> 27:51.312
vowing we'd never
be like them.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.577
- We're not like them.

27:52.620 --> 27:54.531
- No?

27:54.580 --> 27:56.628
And yet you're having affairs,

27:56.670 --> 27:57.978
just like my father.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.194
Am I supposed to play
my mother's role now,

28:01.240 --> 28:03.936
flawlessly hostessing with
a bottle for company?

28:03.980 --> 28:07.154
- Unless you're in a uniform,
nobody sees you as a man.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.668
People can't see
that I'm American,

28:09.730 --> 28:11.539
that this is not
my country's war.

28:12.860 --> 28:14.908
They think I'm a coward.

28:14.950 --> 28:18.465
- And an affair with Hazel
somehow proves that you're not?

28:18.520 --> 28:20.476
- No, but it did help
me feel like a man.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.214
- What if I were the
one who'd strayed?

28:25.260 --> 28:26.989
- That's different.

28:27.050 --> 28:29.780
- Why should it be?
What would you do?

28:29.830 --> 28:31.559
- Don't make me answer that.

28:35.710 --> 28:36.699
- They were filming

28:36.750 --> 28:37.921
only a few days ago

28:37.970 --> 28:39.699
and they've already
got a newsreel?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.921
- If it takes too long,
it's not news, right?

28:41.980 --> 28:42.924
It's history.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.538
- It's called a Director's Cut.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.286
They just bash it together,
see what it looks like.

28:50.110 --> 28:54.206
- It's a great way to ring
in the factory dance.

28:54.250 --> 28:57.378
[ Fanfare ]

28:57.430 --> 29:00.331

knocking on Jerry's door,

29:00.390 --> 29:02.517
they know it'll open wide.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.473
That's because Allied
firepower is unparalleled.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.693
And where do our
munitions come from?

29:08.740 --> 29:10.560
- [Gladys]:
Nice hands, Edith!

...building the bombs that

29:27.720 --> 29:30.063

and win this war.

- [Man]: Let's have you dressed
like that every day!

29:33.460 --> 29:35.451
- Only 6 months ago
she was pruning roses.

29:35.510 --> 29:38.946
Now she just built the

29:38.990 --> 29:42.983
Betty may end her workday
with weary bones,

It's her love

home from fighting Jerry,

to me, Betty.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.472
You are a skilled,
hard-working, decent girl.

30:35.570 --> 30:37.606
That's what they'll
want to be.
