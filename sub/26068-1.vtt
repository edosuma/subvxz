-Okay.
-How I like to work.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.360
The last 20 years, I've been working
with a mixture of individuals and couples

and psychoanalytic techniques.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.680

we should aim to meet at this time
and this location each and every week.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.880
And if you cancel
or you're unable to attend a session,

11:15.960 --> 11:17.840
you will, I'm afraid, still be charged.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.720

a little mercenary

11:24.800 --> 11:26.240
but the purpose, or the aim,

11:26.720 --> 11:30.960
is to create a time and a space
which is entirely yours, week on week.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.640

11:33.720 --> 11:36.240
where frank, intimate discussions
can take place.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.160
But this might not be
what you two are after.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.800
So, you know, in that case, let's…

11:42.880 --> 11:45.080
please, let's have a conversation
about that.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.200
But the purpose, or the goal,
of this first session

11:48.280 --> 11:52.040
is very much to see if the three of us
might be able to work together, so...

11:52.320 --> 11:54.440
feel free to size me up.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.160
I think that all sounds--

11:58.920 --> 11:59.800
Well, we--

12:00.920 --> 12:02.440
-So maybe a bit about us?
-Mmm.

12:02.920 --> 12:03.800
So this was…

12:04.120 --> 12:06.560
I was the one who suggested...

12:08.880 --> 12:09.960
maybe that's a good--

12:10.480 --> 12:11.720
So some friends of ours…

12:13.040 --> 12:16.960
I said to them, I said that Elaine and I,
I said that we'd been having a few…

12:17.040 --> 12:19.520
and he said,
"Well, have you thought about…"

12:19.600 --> 12:23.120
‘cause him and his wife, they'd been,
you know…

12:23.200 --> 12:24.040
And...

12:24.120 --> 12:27.840
They called it analysis.
I don't know if that is therapy?

12:27.920 --> 12:28.800
It's...

12:28.880 --> 12:34.240
But they said, he said… my friend...
our friend... that it was a godsend.

12:34.320 --> 12:39.760
They're his words and he is...
he is a hard bloke to please.

12:41.880 --> 12:46.600
And then that got me thinking,
well, if it can work, then why not?

12:47.440 --> 12:49.640
So we looked at your website.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.560
Great.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.760
And we both really liked the look of that.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.760

talking too… or rabbiting on and on.

in the past year or so…

13:40.760 --> 13:42.120

to just be able to get along.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.200

a little more about what you mean by,

49:33.480 --> 49:34.840
Arguably more of a betrayal?

49:35.320 --> 49:37.280
I opted to toss him off because
I was aware that doing--

49:37.360 --> 49:39.240
-Sorry, you opted?
-Can you--

49:39.320 --> 49:42.080
Happened to be passing a selection
of penises and you opted?

49:42.160 --> 49:44.800
You know what? I think you're behaving…

49:46.400 --> 49:49.560
You are angry and upset
and I can understand that,

49:49.640 --> 49:52.480
but can we at least try and…

49:53.480 --> 49:56.600
at least try and acknowledge
that we are <i>both </i>at fault?

50:00.880 --> 50:03.640
Okay. Fine. I'm sorry.

50:03.960 --> 50:07.080
You should be.
You fucked a colleague, stoned.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.880
-You should be sorry.
<i>-</i>Yeah. And that…

50:11.320 --> 50:14.320
that's what I've been trying to say.

50:19.720 --> 50:20.760
Why did you do it?

50:21.120 --> 50:22.120
Why did <i>you?</i>

50:23.400 --> 50:24.320
Honestly?

50:25.640 --> 50:27.400
What else is there at this point?

50:37.120 --> 50:39.040
I don't enjoy having sex with you.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.120
I think in the last…

50:49.200 --> 50:53.040
recently, in the last, I don't know,
two, maybe three, maybe four… I just...

50:54.840 --> 50:56.720
I haven't really been enjoying
our sex life.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.000
I think we've stopped having fun.

51:02.240 --> 51:05.000
And I think perhaps
we've stopped communicating,

51:05.360 --> 51:11.560
in a way, about... the things we enjoy
or what we want or might want

51:11.640 --> 51:13.040
or might have wanted to try.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.360
And I think perhaps we both… I don't know…

51:23.080 --> 51:26.360
I think somehow we've become
unacceptably boring in bed.

51:29.680 --> 51:32.320
I didn't go looking, if that's
what you mean. I wasn't actively--

51:32.400 --> 51:33.400
No, neither was I.

51:33.480 --> 51:35.400
I feel awful.
I feel fucking awful about it.

51:35.480 --> 51:38.080
No, I know. Listen,
I'm not angry with you. I don't feel--

51:38.160 --> 51:39.240
Well, maybe you should be.

51:40.080 --> 51:43.720
Maybe the fact that you're not,
maybe it makes me think,

51:43.800 --> 51:46.200
"Well, is this something
you wanted to happen?"

51:46.280 --> 51:47.200
[laughs incredulously]

51:50.840 --> 51:53.760
I don't want to reinvent the wheel
every time we go to bed. No.

51:53.840 --> 51:57.360
Nor do I. But, you know, sometimes
I feel like doing something different

51:57.440 --> 51:59.240
or have felt like doing
something different.

51:59.320 --> 52:03.720
Well, then, I think we just need
to be more… organized.

52:06.040 --> 52:06.880
Why?

52:07.280 --> 52:12.280
Because I feel happier
knowing what my day is going to entail.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.920
Yeah, and if that makes me unadventurous,
you know what…

52:16.000 --> 52:21.440
No. It doesn't make you unadventurous.
All it makes us, I think, is different.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.720
Tell me what you did with Claire.
What you and Claire did.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.840
I already have, haven't I?

52:33.920 --> 52:34.800
Not in detail.

52:34.880 --> 52:35.720
What?

52:36.680 --> 52:37.600
No.

52:39.520 --> 52:40.680
You're serious?

52:40.960 --> 52:41.800
Mmm.

52:43.240 --> 52:47.000
How did being with her compare
to being with me?

52:47.920 --> 52:52.120
I can't even… What is this?

52:53.800 --> 52:58.240
I'd like to enjoy having sex
and ideally I'd like to have more of it.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.440
Outside of this room.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.760
You know, not just below these sheets,
keeping our voices down,

53:05.880 --> 53:07.680
once or twice a month, if we're lucky.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.200
But if you don't…

53:12.840 --> 53:15.760
if you don't mind the way it is,

53:15.840 --> 53:19.400
then I think you need to say something.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.920
Sounds to me like you're saying
you've had enough.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.440
-Of us. Of me.
-That has nothing to do with what--

53:31.520 --> 53:34.320
The sex is boring. We've not been honest.
We've been lying to each other.

53:34.400 --> 53:36.400
Okay. Yes. Those are all
statement of facts. But--

53:36.480 --> 53:39.040
As is the fact that, for most people,
this would mean the end of their marriage.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.800
I don't give a shit what this
would mean for most people.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.480
So then you tell me
how do we come back from this?

53:43.600 --> 53:45.960
Okay, I am not saying I've had enough.

53:46.040 --> 53:49.560
Look at me. I am nowhere near
having had enough.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.080
I love you.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.360
I love being with you.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.640
I love the fact that we've been together
as long as we have. I love that.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.520
But, yeah, we have a problem because--

54:01.600 --> 54:02.520
I love you too.

54:03.480 --> 54:04.320
So you should.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.480
Okay. So, when you say
you want to have more sex,

54:17.720 --> 54:21.960
do you mean more sex with me?

54:23.360 --> 54:24.320
Or do you mean…

54:27.120 --> 54:28.920
Well, do you want to have sex with me?

54:33.960 --> 54:38.200
Well, for crying out loud, let's not.
Let's just stop.

54:40.840 --> 54:41.680
Stop?

54:42.600 --> 54:46.600
I don't know. I mean, maybe…

54:51.240 --> 54:54.680
Stop having sex with each other,
you and me?

54:54.760 --> 54:56.160
I don't know, why not?

54:56.240 --> 54:59.560
I mean, for once in our lives, we could do
whatever the fuck we want

54:59.640 --> 55:01.040
and see what happens.

55:01.160 --> 55:06.720
You know, without agonizing over it
or feeling guilty or sheepish

55:06.800 --> 55:10.560
or punishing ourselves for happening
to want different things.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.880
I'm not sure I understand
what it is you're getting at.

55:16.880 --> 55:17.720
Okay.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.960
Would you like to have sex
with Claire again? Yes or no?

55:21.040 --> 55:23.440
I'm not answering that. No.

55:23.800 --> 55:27.600
There is no answer to that question
that could end well.

55:27.680 --> 55:33.040
No. The <i>only </i>way this can end well
is if you answer that question honestly.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.120
Would you like…

55:35.200 --> 55:37.400
-To have sex with Claire? No.
-No, you know what I mean.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.360
Would I like to see Marvin again?

55:41.440 --> 55:42.600
His name is Marvin?

55:42.760 --> 55:43.640
Yes.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.480
Yes, I would.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.840
And don't steer this off course.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.640
Yes fine. Fuck. Yes. Of course I would.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.880
Then why don't we?
