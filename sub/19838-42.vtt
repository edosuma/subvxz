00:02.340 --> 00:05.230
<b>How many are there?</b>

00:05.420 --> 00:07.250
<b>Around five thousand.</b>

00:07.250 --> 00:10.730
<b>And that's a fifth of what they were expecting.</b>

00:10.730 --> 00:13.600
<b>The King must be angry about that.</b>

00:13.600 --> 00:14.710
<b>No...</b>

00:14.710 --> 00:17.360
<b>Apparently, he's been playing games in his room.</b>

00:17.360 --> 00:20.740
<b>He's so obsessed with Gungi, 
he's been skipping meals.</b>

00:20.740 --> 00:23.140
<b>Then what about all this food?</b>

00:23.140 --> 00:24.940
<b>Should we take it for ourselves?</b>

00:24.940 --> 00:27.890
<b>You want to take on the King 
and his Royal Guard?</b>

00:27.890 --> 00:29.620
<b>Don't make me laugh.</b>

00:29.950 --> 00:31.130
<b>Yeah...</b>

00:31.130 --> 00:35.520
<b>Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone 
is until you have enough strength yourself.</b>

00:35.520 --> 00:38.690
<b>They're monsters. I'll do as they say.</b>

00:39.020 --> 00:41.570
<b>When Shaia-dono gave us our powers,</b>

00:41.570 --> 00:44.820
<b>he'd probably anticipated that 
things would turn out this way.</b>

00:44.820 --> 00:46.990
<b>Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!</b>

00:48.120 --> 00:50.770
<b>If you call him by his old name, he gets mad.</b>

02:11.980 --> 02:16.990
<b>Doubt x And x Hesitation</b>

02:25.470 --> 02:28.310
<b>The suit with the glasses is keeping 
a careful watch on his surroundings</b>

02:28.310 --> 02:30.000
<b>while heading toward the palace.</b>

02:30.440 --> 02:32.860
<b>The puppets are useless against him.</b>

02:32.860 --> 02:34.520
<b>He's strong.</b>

02:34.520 --> 02:36.010
<b>What about his abilities?</b>

02:36.460 --> 02:41.050
<b>Like the others, he has used 
only physical attacks thus far.</b>

02:41.050 --> 02:44.390
<b>Okay, let me know if he shows his power.</b>

02:46.720 --> 02:50.700
<b><i>Once Welfin and Brovada arrive, 
we'll take care of those figures in white.</i></b>

02:52.010 --> 02:54.400
<b><i>I can also check out the 
powers those two have.</i></b>

03:00.930 --> 03:02.770
<b>Damn, I lost sight of him!</b>

03:03.280 --> 03:08.660
<b>Leol-sama, it appears that the suit 
with glasses is able to teleport.</b>

03:12.950 --> 03:16.310
<b>Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek.</b>

03:15.860 --> 03:18.290
<b>Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex 
Hide and Seek</b>

03:16.310 --> 03:18.300
<b>It allows him to teleport.</b>

03:19.670 --> 03:25.810
<b>By placing a hand against a wall or the ground, 
he can open a portal to access <i>Nen</i> space.</b>

03:26.260 --> 03:30.470
<b>He is able to transport people 
and objects through that portal.</b>

03:31.550 --> 03:37.310
<b>Hide and Seek creates a <i>Nen</i> space of 
twenty-one rooms, on four floors.</b>

03:37.970 --> 03:41.340
<b>Each room is isolated.</b>

03:41.340 --> 03:44.720
<b>The entrance shuts when anyone enters,</b>

03:45.070 --> 03:49.950
<b>so to return to the real world, 
one must exit by a different door.</b>

03:50.490 --> 03:53.450
<b>It is possible to create multiple entrances.</b>

03:53.760 --> 03:56.670
<b>The number of possible entrances differs 
depending on the size of the room.</b>

03:57.080 --> 04:00.150
<b>The exit leads back to the portal used for entry.</b>

04:00.640 --> 04:06.790
<b>So, as a general rule, one can only enter 
and exit via the location of the entry portal.</b>

04:07.600 --> 04:10.280
<b>However, using Knov's master key,</b>

04:10.850 --> 04:14.870
<b>an exit can be linked to any portal.</b>

04:26.470 --> 04:27.860
<b><i>Nothing out of place.</i></b>

04:28.260 --> 04:30.120
<b><i>Still quiet on the battlefront.</i></b>

04:31.130 --> 04:35.370
<b>Morel's Deep Purple is used for 
primarily defensive purposes.</b>

04:35.760 --> 04:39.960
<b>If a puppet encounters someone who 
isn't an ally, it will keep its distance.</b>

04:39.960 --> 04:43.560
<b>If it comes under attack, it will 
retreat, while fighting back.</b>

04:44.450 --> 04:50.180
<b>The puppets fight back by throwing 
nearby objects at the enemy.</b>

04:50.820 --> 04:53.380
<b>They avoid direct contact,</b>

04:53.380 --> 04:58.770
<b>so the enemy won't realize 
they are <i>Nen</i> puppets.</b>

05:00.530 --> 05:03.030
<b><i>That's a Chimera...</i></b>

05:03.710 --> 05:04.810
<b><i>What is it doing?</i></b>

05:05.340 --> 05:08.390
<b><i>We're pretty far from the battlefield.</i></b>

05:08.890 --> 05:09.780
<b><i>Is it scouting the area?</i></b>

05:12.150 --> 05:15.350
<b><i>There were strange dragonflies around town.</i></b>

05:15.350 --> 05:19.790
<b><i>I thought they were a local species, 
but might they be created from his </i>Nen<i>?</i></b>

05:20.510 --> 05:21.800
<b><i>It's very likely...</i></b>

05:22.650 --> 05:27.050
<b><i>If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in 
gathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!</i></b>

05:27.710 --> 05:28.500
<b><i>The battle is on.</i></b>

05:36.260 --> 05:39.020
<b>Hey... Hey!</b>

05:40.890 --> 05:43.210
<b>Aren't you gonna touch me?</b>

05:44.040 --> 05:46.800
<b>Look how close I am...</b>

05:46.800 --> 05:48.320
<b>I know you're awake.</b>

05:50.020 --> 05:51.090
<b>Whoa, there!</b>

05:52.620 --> 05:54.330
<b>I knew you were faking it.</b>

05:54.330 --> 05:56.080
<b>You can't trick me!</b>

05:56.490 --> 05:59.160
<b>With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!</b>

05:59.160 --> 06:01.090
<b>Give me some peace and quiet!</b>

06:02.790 --> 06:04.020
<b>No way!</b>

06:04.020 --> 06:05.940
<b>I won't let you get any sleep!</b>

06:05.940 --> 06:08.610
<b>I'll keep making noise until you chase me!</b>

06:08.930 --> 06:10.330
<b><i>Idiot...</i></b>

06:10.330 --> 06:13.800
<b><i>If that's what you wanted, 
you should have set a rule</i></b>

06:13.800 --> 06:16.160
<b><i>to force people to keep chasing you.</i></b>

06:16.790 --> 06:20.690
<b><i>Looks like he's still getting 
used to his new power...</i></b>

06:21.460 --> 06:22.910
<b>Have it your way.</b>

06:22.910 --> 06:25.480
<b>I won't be getting up for the next five hours.</b>

06:28.430 --> 06:31.490
<b><i>He's really focused on making 
this a contest of speed.</i></b>

06:32.570 --> 06:36.240
<b><i>Coupled with his constant need for attention,</i></b>

06:36.240 --> 06:39.330
<b><i>it's unlikely that he'll settle for 
any other type of contest.</i></b>

06:41.270 --> 06:44.000
<b>I'm not gonna let you sleep!</b>

06:44.530 --> 06:45.870
<b>Hey! Over here!</b>

06:45.870 --> 06:47.540
<b>I'm within reach...</b>

06:47.540 --> 06:48.510
<b>Get up!</b>

06:48.910 --> 06:50.800
<b>Look how close I am.</b>

06:50.800 --> 06:52.330
<b><i>It's just a waiting game.</i></b>

06:52.650 --> 06:56.580
<b><i>If he gives up and moves away...</i></b>

06:58.210 --> 06:59.770
<b><i>I win.</i></b>

07:22.130 --> 07:24.250
<b>9-9-1, marshal.</b>

07:25.940 --> 07:28.010
<b>1-5-1, marshal.</b>

07:29.260 --> 07:31.510
<b>7-9-1, pawn.</b>

07:32.760 --> 07:35.010
<b>2-3-1, pawn.</b>

07:36.080 --> 07:38.430
<b>8-1-1, spy.</b>

07:39.490 --> 07:42.020
<b>2-3-1, cannon.</b>

07:42.670 --> 07:44.770
<b>9-1-1, fortress.</b>

07:45.980 --> 07:47.780
<b>2-7-2, musketeer.</b>

07:49.410 --> 07:51.060
<b>The marshal has been isolated...</b>

07:52.670 --> 07:55.550
<b>I'll call this "remote concealment."</b>

07:56.480 --> 07:58.660
<b>7-1-2, fortress.</b>

07:59.950 --> 08:02.160
<b>1-6-2, general.</b>

08:03.370 --> 08:05.470
<b>9-1-3, archer.</b>

08:06.440 --> 08:08.730
<b>3-2-2, major general.</b>

08:09.620 --> 08:10.560
<b>I'm done.</b>

08:11.350 --> 08:13.790
<b><i>Her initial placement was exactly as expected.</i></b>

08:14.340 --> 08:18.430
<b><i>She's shifting toward my marshal 
without breaking her crane formation.</i></b>

08:19.210 --> 08:21.320
<b>Let us begin, then.</b>

08:22.120 --> 08:24.690
<b><i>Her first move will be to position 
her archer on her right flank.</i></b>

08:24.690 --> 08:28.340
<b><i>She'll probably try a three-pronged 
attack to end it quickly.</i></b>

08:28.340 --> 08:33.420
<b><i>But shifting her pieces to the right 
exposes her left flank to attack.</i></b>

08:35.770 --> 08:38.650
<b><i>It's time to disrupt your rhythm.</i></b>

08:42.590 --> 08:44.830
<b>1-9-3, new archer.</b>

08:45.390 --> 08:46.330
<b><i>There it is.</i></b>

08:47.670 --> 08:50.010
<b>9-7-1, new spy.</b>

08:52.230 --> 08:54.430
<b>2-9-1, knight.</b>

08:54.820 --> 08:57.630
<b><i>Her three-pronged attack 
and left flank movement</i></b>

08:57.630 --> 08:59.930
<b><i>will cost me two pieces.</i></b>

09:00.580 --> 09:03.940
<b><i>But that created an opening in her left flank.</i></b>

09:03.940 --> 09:07.290
<b><i>She'll probably expect me to 
go all-in from that side.</i></b>

09:08.300 --> 09:09.340
<b><i>But I won't!</i></b>

09:09.860 --> 09:10.740
<b><i>Here it is!</i></b>

09:13.090 --> 09:15.270
<b>5-5-1, lieutenant general.</b>

09:23.930 --> 09:27.280
<b><i>Each of her moves has followed 
a set rhythm until just now,</i></b>

09:27.760 --> 09:29.460
<b><i>when she froze.</i></b>

09:29.810 --> 09:31.210
<b><i>Given the current placement,</i></b>

09:31.570 --> 09:34.190
<b><i>I can attack through the 
center in unlimited ways.</i></b>

09:35.140 --> 09:36.310
<b><i>There is no best move.</i></b>

09:37.010 --> 09:40.610
<b><i>With every turn, I have the 
ability to extend the match.</i></b>

09:41.890 --> 09:43.570
<b><i>Now, let me hear you</i></b>

09:44.380 --> 09:46.000
<b><i>squeal!</i></b>

10:04.970 --> 10:07.500
<b>9-2-1, new lieutenant general.</b>

10:19.020 --> 10:20.260
<b>That's checkmate.</b>

10:22.560 --> 10:26.520
<b>You knew my strategy was a dead end.</b>

10:24.350 --> 10:26.520
<b>Dead End</b>

10:27.780 --> 10:28.520
<b>Yes.</b>

10:28.760 --> 10:31.780
<b>Why did you need to think 
before making your move?</b>

10:32.250 --> 10:34.560
<b>You could have made that move at once.</b>

10:35.710 --> 10:37.810
<b><i>The King has moved this match off the board.</i></b>

10:38.210 --> 10:39.910
<b><i>A wrong answer could mean</i></b>

10:40.810 --> 10:42.410
<b><i>her death.</i></b>

10:44.340 --> 10:48.120
<b>Your "remote concealment" strategy</b>

10:48.120 --> 10:51.070
<b>is actually named "kokoriko."</b>

10:52.250 --> 10:54.420
<b>I came up with that strategy...</b>

10:55.630 --> 10:57.670
<b>ten years ago.</b>

10:59.650 --> 11:01.790
<b>Placing the lieutenant general in the center</b>

11:01.790 --> 11:06.660
<b>to counter a three-pronged attack is also a
 move I devised, called "general in the middle."</b>

11:07.100 --> 11:09.510
<b>At the time, both drew a lot of attention.</b>

11:10.000 --> 11:14.720
<b>Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle 
was a popular transition that tested</b>

11:14.720 --> 11:17.870
<b>both players' ability to read their opponents.</b>

11:18.960 --> 11:21.690
<b>I was pretty happy</b>

11:21.690 --> 11:27.220
<b>that a fool like me could figure 
out a smart strategy...</b>

11:28.450 --> 11:30.960
<b>But then, I saw how to defeat it.</b>

11:32.790 --> 11:35.430
<b>A year after I came up with kokoriko,</b>

11:35.430 --> 11:40.080
<b>an opponent used it against me 
in the national tournament,</b>

11:40.080 --> 11:42.470
<b>and I figured out how to counter it.</b>

11:43.480 --> 11:45.590
<b>I won the match,</b>

11:45.590 --> 11:50.410
<b>but the strategy disappeared from 
official matches and textbooks.</b>

11:51.460 --> 11:56.250
<b>That the Supreme Leader thought 
of the same strategy as I had...</b>

11:56.250 --> 12:01.790
<b>I was so honored, and touched...
My heart trembled.</b>

12:02.990 --> 12:04.030
<b>It felt like...</b>

12:08.270 --> 12:12.000
<b>Like seeing my child brought back to life.</b>

12:13.860 --> 12:15.650
<b>That was how it felt.</b>

12:16.620 --> 12:22.610
<b>So it was difficult for me 
to take that life again.</b>

12:25.510 --> 12:26.740
<b>That was why</b>

12:27.240 --> 12:28.670
<b>I hesitated.</b>

12:37.980 --> 12:39.020
<b>Foolishness.</b>

12:39.370 --> 12:41.020
<b>I've had enough.</b>

12:41.020 --> 12:42.340
<b>Get some rest.</b>

12:45.790 --> 12:47.330
<b>Once we begin again,</b>

12:48.940 --> 12:51.120
<b>you won't get any more breaks.</b>

12:51.120 --> 12:52.290
<b>Be prepared!</b>

12:53.140 --> 12:54.850
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

12:58.600 --> 13:00.120
<b><i>I believe this is</i></b>

13:00.120 --> 13:05.290
<b><i>the first time the King has ever listened 
to anyone speak for such a long time.</i></b>

13:06.000 --> 13:06.800
<b><i>Well,</i></b>

13:07.530 --> 13:09.230
<b><i>it should have no significance...</i></b>

13:12.760 --> 13:14.810
<b><i>Four hours have passed?</i></b>

13:18.140 --> 13:20.740
<b><i>He got bored and started reading...</i></b>

13:20.740 --> 13:23.070
<b><i>That guy's too easy to understand.</i></b>

13:27.590 --> 13:29.240
<b>Oh, you're ready to start?</b>

13:29.240 --> 13:31.070
<b>Has it already been five hours?</b>

13:31.070 --> 13:33.480
<b>Wait, it's only half full.</b>

13:34.280 --> 13:36.050
<b>Are you getting worried?</b>

13:42.330 --> 13:43.840
<b>You just noticed?</b>

13:44.310 --> 13:45.850
<b>We aren't starting now.</b>

13:45.850 --> 13:47.100
<b>It's already over.</b>

13:47.800 --> 13:49.850
<b>Look at your ankle.</b>

13:52.790 --> 13:55.100
<b><i>A rope of smoke?</i></b>

13:55.320 --> 13:57.600
<b>That took a lot of effort...</b>

13:58.290 --> 14:01.830
<b>I had to go all the way around 
so you wouldn't notice,</b>

14:01.830 --> 14:04.610
<b>so it turned into quite a long rope.</b>

14:06.180 --> 14:09.730
<b>In any case, all that's left 
is to wind up the rope.</b>

14:11.010 --> 14:12.870
<b>Now it's only a matter of time.</b>

14:21.350 --> 14:24.380
<b>Your turn to try whatever you can.</b>

14:24.380 --> 14:25.460
<b>But it won't work.</b>

14:32.070 --> 14:34.700
<b>You should take the smoke seriously.</b>

14:34.700 --> 14:37.310
<b>Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed.</b>

14:38.200 --> 14:39.930
<b>You can struggle all you want.</b>

14:49.260 --> 14:50.710
<b><i>I knew it...</i></b>

14:51.260 --> 14:55.560
<b><i>He won't attack me because 
this is a game of tag.</i></b>

14:56.110 --> 15:00.900
<b><i>If I touch his body, it will break his ability.</i></b>

15:01.610 --> 15:06.820
<b><i>He has no patience, but he chose 
for the game to last eight hours.</i></b>

15:06.820 --> 15:09.590
<b><i>I'm not the one you're putting pressure on.</i></b>

15:10.280 --> 15:11.920
<b><i>The pressure's on you.</i></b>

15:13.440 --> 15:16.350
<b>Cheetu's power was still a work in progress.</b>

15:16.880 --> 15:22.290
<b>With his back against the wall, 
desperate for a way out...</b>

15:24.120 --> 15:26.360
<b>He created a new ability.</b>

15:34.410 --> 15:35.990
<b>A crossbow and claws.</b>

15:37.240 --> 15:41.090
<b><i>He can fight at any range.</i></b>

15:43.200 --> 15:44.560
<b>Thanks!</b>

15:44.560 --> 15:47.990
<b>You helped me gain an awesome new power!</b>

15:49.010 --> 15:51.860
<b>Hey, do you know what this is?</b>

15:51.860 --> 15:53.010
<b>It's a bow. A bow!</b>

15:54.720 --> 15:56.850
<b>You sure you want to come closer?!</b>

15:57.600 --> 15:58.520
<b>There!</b>

16:00.070 --> 16:01.270
<b>I'm quite sure.</b>

16:03.030 --> 16:08.530
<b>Why would you want a power 
that's slower than you are?</b>

16:09.400 --> 16:10.280
<b>Ah.</b>

16:10.580 --> 16:13.290
<b>Why don't you try those claws?</b>

16:13.290 --> 16:16.260
<b>Then I won't have to walk over.</b>

16:17.180 --> 16:19.290
<b>I'll tell you why you lost.</b>

16:19.710 --> 16:21.040
<b>It's because</b>

16:22.220 --> 16:23.770
<b>you're an idiot.</b>

16:35.230 --> 16:36.330
<b>Die!</b>

16:36.330 --> 16:38.890
<b>Then you can never touch me!</b>

16:40.390 --> 16:42.100
<b><i>This sensation...</i></b>

16:43.370 --> 16:44.200
<b><i>It can't be...</i></b>

16:45.120 --> 16:46.150
<b><i>Smoke?</i></b>

16:47.200 --> 16:48.270
<b><i>No way!</i></b>

16:49.960 --> 16:51.990
<b>Caught you.</b>

16:53.130 --> 16:55.060
<b>Wh-When did you...</b>

16:56.160 --> 16:59.790
<b>While you were reading manga 
and laughing like a fool,</b>

17:00.570 --> 17:05.000
<b>I created a copy of myself from smoke.</b>

17:05.000 --> 17:08.190
<b>And I covered myself with smoke 
that looked like grass.</b>

17:08.620 --> 17:11.300
<b>My copy went one way, and I went the other.</b>

17:11.300 --> 17:13.900
<b>The fight continues, even while one sleeps.</b>

17:13.900 --> 17:16.680
<b>You shouldn't have looked away.</b>

17:19.260 --> 17:21.120
<b>Looks like we're back...</b>

17:21.520 --> 17:23.430
<b>Well, do you still want to fight?</b>

17:25.820 --> 17:27.870
<b>No, I've had enough.</b>

17:28.740 --> 17:30.940
<b>That's a wise decision...</b>

17:31.250 --> 17:34.610
<b>Then why not tell me</b>

17:34.610 --> 17:39.510
<b>what would have happened 
if I hadn't caught you?</b>

17:39.850 --> 17:41.720
<b>There's no point in asking.</b>

17:41.720 --> 17:45.940
<b>Once I've been caught, 
I can't use that power anymore.</b>

17:45.940 --> 17:48.430
<b>That was the condition I set.</b>

17:48.430 --> 17:50.960
<b>Really? I feel bad...</b>

17:52.160 --> 17:53.860
<b>It's no big deal.</b>

17:53.860 --> 17:56.980
<b>I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!</b>

17:56.980 --> 17:59.250
<b>Next time, I won't lose.</b>

17:59.250 --> 18:00.880
<b>You'd better be ready!</b>

18:01.300 --> 18:02.970
<b><i>His superior</i></b>

18:03.810 --> 18:07.040
<b><i>is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia,</i></b>

18:07.040 --> 18:10.730
<b><i>who has the power to release</i> Nen <i>skills.</i></b>

18:11.330 --> 18:16.080
<b><i>So if the selection is carried out, 
winning will become very difficult.</i></b>

18:16.610 --> 18:20.490
<b><i>Gon and Killua made the right choice.</i></b>

18:21.320 --> 18:22.470
<b>We need to meet.</b>

18:22.470 --> 18:23.610
<b>Let's talk inside.</b>

18:25.480 --> 18:26.860
<b>Reinforcements have arrived.</b>

18:26.860 --> 18:28.630
<b>It's a crayfish and a wolf.</b>

18:28.630 --> 18:29.930
<b>Are they strong?</b>

18:29.930 --> 18:32.000
<b>If I knew, my job would be easier...</b>

18:32.460 --> 18:35.510
<b>Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength.</b>

18:35.910 --> 18:37.660
<b>So it's currently a stalemate.</b>

18:37.660 --> 18:41.250
<b>Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out.</b>

18:41.250 --> 18:44.140
<b>I suspect it's because I took out this one.</b>

18:45.340 --> 18:48.910
<b>Those dragonflies were acting 
as security cameras.</b>

18:49.470 --> 18:51.330
<b>Come in, Flutter!</b>

18:52.890 --> 18:55.180
<b>Doesn't seem he's going to show.</b>

18:55.180 --> 18:56.900
<b>Change in plans!</b>

18:57.250 --> 19:00.480
<b>Without Flutter, we have no way 
to know the enemy's location.</b>

19:00.480 --> 19:01.320
<b>Damn.</b>

19:01.930 --> 19:04.280
<b><i>When it really counts, he lets me down!</i></b>

19:04.720 --> 19:06.300
<b><i>Should I call it off?</i></b>

19:06.300 --> 19:07.290
<b><i>No, I can't do that.</i></b>

19:07.990 --> 19:11.290
<b><i>I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!</i></b>

19:11.290 --> 19:13.170
<b>We're heading back, then.</b>

19:13.630 --> 19:15.100
<b>Ah, hold on...</b>

19:15.840 --> 19:18.170
<b>It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it.</b>

19:19.200 --> 19:21.670
<b>Rental Pod
IOU Dispenser</b>

19:21.960 --> 19:23.930
<b>Is that your power?</b>

19:24.280 --> 19:26.380
<b>Yeah, I can use it to scout around.</b>

19:26.380 --> 19:28.020
<b>Don't tell anyone else...</b>

19:28.020 --> 19:29.950
<b>I'm showing you because I trust you.</b>

19:30.420 --> 19:33.370
<b><i>Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth.</i></b>

19:34.080 --> 19:37.440
<b>Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily</b>

19:37.440 --> 19:44.050
<b>borrow an ability in exchange 
for granting the target a favor.</b>

19:44.050 --> 19:46.870
<b>However, two conditions must be met.</b>

19:47.260 --> 19:48.250
<b>First,</b>

19:48.250 --> 19:52.350
<b>he must have seen the ability or know its name.</b>

19:49.770 --> 19:51.710
<b>Satellite Dragonflies</b>

19:52.570 --> 19:55.590
<b>Second, he must grant a favor.</b>

19:55.590 --> 20:00.050
<b>After confirming that his favor is not 
free and is expected to be repaid,</b>

20:00.050 --> 20:05.580
<b>this skill will activate, assuming 
the target agrees to his conditions.</b>

20:05.580 --> 20:06.210
<b><i>Got it!</i></b>

20:06.820 --> 20:12.720
<b>Once all conditions are met, Leol's 
dispenser automatically stores data,</b>

20:12.720 --> 20:15.070
<b>which can be checked at any time.</b>

20:15.590 --> 20:20.480
<b>However, if the target dies, 
the data will be deleted.</b>

20:21.150 --> 20:22.590
<b>Flutter's fine.</b>

20:23.860 --> 20:26.880
<b><i>I believe there's been no communication</i></b>

20:26.880 --> 20:28.910
<b><i>because he's unconscious or far away.</i></b>

20:29.250 --> 20:31.500
<b>A rental can be used for one hour.</b>

20:31.500 --> 20:35.420
<b>During the rental period, the target 
cannot use the borrowed power.</b>

20:35.950 --> 20:38.080
<b><i>Anyway, Flutter is still alive...</i></b>

20:38.660 --> 20:40.580
<b>Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch.</b>

20:40.580 --> 20:42.120
<b>Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies</b>

20:42.120 --> 20:45.110
<b>verify the location of the suit 
with the glasses, we'll start.</b>

20:45.580 --> 20:50.130
<b>So we keep the small fry at a distance 
while you take on the suit with the glasses.</b>

20:50.580 --> 20:52.430
<b>You gonna be okay on your own?</b>

20:52.430 --> 20:56.070
<b>Just trust me. I wouldn't give 
you a job you can't handle.</b>

20:58.110 --> 21:01.970
<b><i>And I don't want you to see my power.</i></b>

21:02.830 --> 21:06.140
<b><i>I'll do whatever it takes to 
complete this mission.</i></b>

21:07.000 --> 21:08.540
<b><i>Okay...</i></b>

21:09.720 --> 21:12.220
<b><i>I can't afford to wait around here.</i></b>

21:12.920 --> 21:15.460
<b><i>Not until the King is in my debt!</i></b>

21:15.780 --> 21:20.380
<b>When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and 
tears it up, the effect activates.</b>

21:22.560 --> 21:23.750
<b>They're here.</b>

21:25.210 --> 21:26.790
<b>Time to start scouting.</b>

21:31.600 --> 21:32.690
<b><i>I don't understand.</i></b>

21:34.460 --> 21:35.590
<b><i>This is upsetting.</i></b>

21:36.190 --> 21:39.770
<b><i>During our matches, I am the only 
one who's getting flustered.</i></b>

21:41.190 --> 21:45.560
<b><i>I would have expected this to be 
humiliating on a new level.</i></b>

21:46.330 --> 21:47.490
<b><i>But...</i></b>

21:48.450 --> 21:53.260
<b><i>At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.</i></b>

21:55.640 --> 21:59.210
<b><i>But I don't understand why...</i></b>

23:24.740 --> 23:27.340
<b>Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening.</b>

23:27.340 --> 23:30.380
<b>Morel-san, what's in your pipe?</b>

23:30.380 --> 23:31.480
<b>It holds...</b>

23:31.480 --> 23:32.590
<b>Gulp.</b>

23:32.590 --> 23:33.730
<b>...tonkotsu.</b>
