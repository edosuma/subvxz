smash!

20:16.615 --> 20:18.884
&gt;&gt; GREAT LANDING.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

20:18.951 --> 20:19.918
thud!

20:19.985 --> 20:21.920
&gt;&gt; OKAY, CHOSEN ONE,

20:21.987 --> 20:24.289
WHAT'S THE OPERATION CALLED
THIS TIME?

20:24.356 --> 20:26.425
&gt;&gt; I CALL IT OPERATION
GRAB THIS WAND

20:26.491 --> 20:27.693
AND FIGURE OUT HOW IT WORKS,

20:27.759 --> 20:29.394
THEN DRAG IT BACK TO EARTH
AND USE ITS MAGIC

20:29.461 --> 20:30.696
TO CRUSH THE DESTRUCTINATOR,

20:30.762 --> 20:32.564
THEN BLAST THE DARKNESS WITH IT.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.633
&gt;&gt; GOOD PLAN.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.268
&gt;&gt; EXCEPT IT WON'T WORK.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.406
all: TURBO THUNDER?

20:41.473 --> 20:43.675
&gt;&gt; WOW, YOU REALLY
LET YOURSELF GO.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.444
&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS I, TURBO THUNDER,

20:45.510 --> 20:47.379
REGISTERED TRADEMARK
AND ORIGINAL CHOSEN ONE.

20:47.446 --> 20:48.580
THUNDERWEAR SOLD SEPARATELY.

20:48.647 --> 20:49.948
cha-ching!

20:50.015 --> 20:51.817
AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW THAT WAND WORKS,

20:51.883 --> 20:53.552
WE MUST WORK TOGETHER,
TIMMY TURNER.

20:53.619 --> 20:54.786
&gt;&gt; WELL, FORGET IT.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.188
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE TO HELP ME,

20:56.254 --> 20:57.556
AND YOU LEFT ME ON THUNDERWORLD

20:57.623 --> 20:59.257
TO GET SUCKED UP
BY THE DARKNESS.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.993
SO STEP OFF, GIRLFRIEND,

21:01.059 --> 21:03.795
'CAUSE I'M TAKING
THIS PEPPY MEAL TO GO.

21:03.862 --> 21:04.830
[grunts]

21:04.896 --> 21:06.832
PEPPY MEAL'S NOT BUDGING.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.533
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BUDGE.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.836
IT'S SUPPOSED TO LIGHT OUR WAY.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.137
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW?

21:12.204 --> 21:13.972
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE AFTER
THE ROCK GUARDIAN

21:14.039 --> 21:17.743
FLICKED ME OVER THE HORIZON
LIKE A CHOSEN BOOGER,

21:17.809 --> 21:22.447
I REALIZED HOW ALONE
IN THE UNIVERSE I WAS.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.617
[sobs]

21:25.684 --> 21:28.887
THEN I MADE A FRIEND.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.222
LITERALLY, I MADE IT.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.661
THEN I MADE A ROCK LUNCH,

21:35.727 --> 21:37.195
[shattering]

21:37.262 --> 21:40.766
WHICH DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT.

21:40.832 --> 21:44.536
BUT IT WAS ROCKY'S SMILE THAT
COMFORTED MY LONELY NIGHTS HERE

21:44.603 --> 21:48.740
AND MADE ME UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN LIFE...

21:48.807 --> 21:49.708
[exhaling rhythmically]

21:49.775 --> 21:50.742
HONOR...

21:50.809 --> 21:52.177
HA-HA!

21:52.244 --> 21:54.913
HUMILITY,

21:54.980 --> 21:58.250
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
OF ALL.

21:58.316 --> 21:59.251
&gt;&gt; HOW THE WAND WORKS?

21:59.317 --> 22:00.752
&gt;&gt; NO, LUNCH.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.988
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT
THAT'S NOT ROCK-BASED?

22:03.055 --> 22:04.823
&gt;&gt; SHOW US HOW THE WAND WORKS!

22:10.729 --> 22:12.864
[rumbling noise]

22:20.605 --> 22:23.875
[zapping noise]

22:26.812 --> 22:27.946
ka-boom!

22:28.013 --> 22:30.282
[rumbling noise]

22:39.024 --> 22:39.891
[all gasp]

22:42.194 --> 22:43.361
&gt;&gt; ROCKY!

22:43.428 --> 22:45.330
YOU WERE RIGHT!

22:45.397 --> 22:46.331
&gt;&gt; AND LOOK!

22:46.398 --> 22:47.999
THE FINAL PROPHECY.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.334
&gt;&gt; HA-HA!

22:49.401 --> 22:52.838
I KNEW I'D SAVE YOU GUYS.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.207
THERE'S ANOTHER WAND?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.109
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE FINAL WAND.

22:57.175 --> 22:59.811
AND SINCE
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE,

22:59.878 --> 23:01.413
YOU HAVE TO FIND IT,

23:01.480 --> 23:04.282
AND YOU CAN USE THIS
TO GET ME FOOD NOW.

23:04.349 --> 23:05.550
REMEMBER, NO ROCKS.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.285
&gt;&gt; STAND BACK, TURBO HUNGER,

23:07.352 --> 23:09.554
AND BEHOLD
A MEAL FIT FOR A KING.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.658
&gt;&gt; AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.494
AND THAT'S
"A MEAL FIT FOR A KING"?

23:15.560 --> 23:19.131
&gt;&gt; IT IS FOR THE KING
OF ICE CREAM LAND.

23:19.197 --> 23:22.167
NOW, MUNCH BEFORE YOUR KING.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.301
chomp!

23:23.368 --> 23:27.038
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU POOF UP ONE
FOR ROCKY?

23:27.105 --> 23:29.708
&gt;&gt; "TO END THE DARKNESS
WITH THE POWER THRICE,

23:29.775 --> 23:32.778
THE LAST WAND LIES
INSIDE EARTH'S ICE."

23:32.844 --> 23:34.579
&gt;&gt; GREAT!
I DON'T GET IT.

23:34.646 --> 23:37.816
&gt;&gt; THE ICE WAND
COMPLETES A MAGIC TRIAD.

23:37.883 --> 23:40.285
AND WHEN COMBINED WITH
THE FIRE WAND ON FAIRYWORLD

23:40.352 --> 23:42.587
AND THE WIND WAND HERE ON VEGON,

23:42.654 --> 23:44.422
IT'S A TRIPLE-POWERED
COMBINATION

23:44.489 --> 23:46.858
THAT WILL EMIT A GAZILLION-TON
BURST OF MAGIC

23:46.925 --> 23:49.027
THAT WILL FINALLY
DESTROY THE DARKNESS

23:49.094 --> 23:51.263
AND--CAN I HAVE ANOTHER ICE
CREAM SANDWICH, YOUR MAJESTY?

23:51.329 --> 23:54.866
&gt;&gt; ONLY BECAUSE YOU AMUSE ME,
PEASANT.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.668
chomp!

23:56.735 --> 23:57.702
&gt;&gt; WOW!

23:57.769 --> 23:59.137
THESE ARE FILLING.

23:59.204 --> 24:00.806
&gt;&gt; BUT HOW DO WE
FIND A WAND IN THE ICE

24:00.872 --> 24:02.207
WHEN THE EARTH
IS COVERED IN METAL

24:02.274 --> 24:04.309
AND CONTROLLED
BY A GIANT ROBOT FREAK?

24:04.376 --> 24:06.077
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO HELP YOU.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.080
TIMMY, MY WORLD, LIKE YOURS,

24:09.147 --> 24:12.417
WAS DESTROYED BY THE DARKNESS.

24:12.484 --> 24:15.153
I WAS JUST A BOY LOVING LIFE
ON MY HOME PLANET,

24:15.220 --> 24:19.691
WONDERWORLD.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.660
IT WAS A MAGICAL PLACE,

24:21.726 --> 24:23.495
NOT UNLIKE YOUR FAIRYWORLD.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.630
MY PEOPLE HAD POWERS,

24:25.697 --> 24:28.099
SOME COOL...

24:28.166 --> 24:29.034
[cheering]

24:32.437 --> 24:34.673
SOME KIND OF STRANGE.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.008
OURS WAS A PEACEFUL EXISTENCE

24:37.075 --> 24:40.545
UNTIL THAT FATEFUL DAY
WHEN THE DARKNESS ARRIVED.

24:40.612 --> 24:43.415
[ominous growling noise]

24:43.481 --> 24:44.482
WHAT IS THAT?

24:44.549 --> 24:46.184
IT'S DARK AND SCARY.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.652
&gt;&gt; THANK GOODNESS
OUR PEACEFUL PLANET

24:47.719 --> 24:49.421
HAS A KILLER DEFENSE SYSTEM

24:49.487 --> 24:51.423
THAT IS BLASTING
THE CRUD OUT OF IT.

24:51.489 --> 24:53.425
bang! bang!

24:53.491 --> 24:55.026
&gt;&gt; BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

24:55.093 --> 24:57.262
SOON THE ELIMINATORS ARRIVED

24:57.329 --> 24:59.664
AND TOOK AWAY THE ONLY THINGS
I EVER LOVED.

25:04.502 --> 25:07.205
WHOA!

25:07.272 --> 25:08.406
&gt;&gt; [wailing]

25:08.473 --> 25:11.743
&gt;&gt; THEY TOOK MY FAMILY.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.312
THE FORCE OF THE DARKNESS
SWALLOWING WONDERWORLD

25:14.379 --> 25:19.050
CAUSED IT TO BREAK APART.

25:19.117 --> 25:24.823
AND CAUSED ME TO HURTLE, ALONE,
BRAVELY THROUGH SPACE

25:24.890 --> 25:29.160
UNTIL I SAFELY LANDED
ON A DESERTED PINK PLANET.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.395
crash!

25:31.963 --> 25:33.798
[grunting]

25:36.635 --> 25:39.905
IT WAS THERE I SWORE VENGEANCE
UPON THE DARKNESS

25:39.971 --> 25:44.376
AND VOWED TO TRAIN MYSELF
AND PERFECT MY WONDER POWERS.

25:44.442 --> 25:45.310
[blasting]

25:50.916 --> 25:52.717
[blasting]

25:52.784 --> 25:53.752
ka-boom!

25:56.221 --> 25:57.088
smash!

25:58.857 --> 26:03.528
THEN I RECEIVED AN INVITATION
TO A CHOSEN ONE COMPETITION

26:03.595 --> 26:05.697
IN THE LAND CALLED FAIRYWORLD

26:05.764 --> 26:09.200
WHERE SOME FAIRY ELDERS
WERE SEEKING OUTSIDE MIGHT

26:09.267 --> 26:12.203
IN THEIR OWN QUEST
TO CRUSH THE DARKNESS.

26:15.573 --> 26:18.109
&gt;&gt; [mutters]

26:18.176 --> 26:19.110
{\an5}bonk!

26:18.176 --> 26:19.110
both: NEXT.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.579
&gt;&gt; [screams]

26:21.646 --> 26:22.580
[whimpers]

26:22.647 --> 26:25.050
&gt;&gt; NEXT.

26:25.116 --> 26:26.284
&gt;&gt; [groaning]

26:26.351 --> 26:28.787
[blasting]

26:39.030 --> 26:40.298
FROM THAT MOMENT ON,

26:40.365 --> 26:43.301
I WAS NO LONGER
PIPPY DINGLEFITZ

26:43.368 --> 26:46.037
BUT TURBO THUNDER.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.906
&gt;&gt; YOUR REAL NAME IS PIPPY?
[laughing]

26:47.973 --> 26:50.275
[blasting]

26:50.342 --> 26:53.011
&gt;&gt; THEN I PERCHED MYSELF
ATOP THE HIGHEST PEAK

26:53.078 --> 26:55.847
IN THE LAND
I NOW DUBBED THUNDERWORLD

26:55.914 --> 26:58.850
AND WAITED
FOR THE DARKNESS TO RETURN

26:58.917 --> 27:03.555
SO I COULD SEEK MY REVENGE!

27:03.621 --> 27:04.923
I WAITED

27:04.990 --> 27:06.324
AND WAITED

27:06.391 --> 27:08.259
AND WAITED.

27:08.326 --> 27:09.694
&gt;&gt; THEN YOU FELL ASLEEP,

27:09.761 --> 27:11.496
MISSED YOUR CALLING
WHEN THE DARKNESS RETURNED,

27:11.563 --> 27:13.264
AND I HAD TO BEAT IT FOR YOU.

27:13.331 --> 27:14.699
&gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE ACCEPTED MY FATE

27:14.766 --> 27:17.268
AS THE FORMER CHOSEN ONE
WHO SLEPT THROUGH HIS DESTINY.

27:17.335 --> 27:18.770
AND AS THE NEW CHOSEN ONE,

27:18.837 --> 27:20.271
YOU MUST NOW ACCEPT YOURS,

27:20.338 --> 27:21.973
FOR, TIMMY TURNER,

27:22.040 --> 27:24.242
I...AM...

27:24.309 --> 27:26.044
&gt;&gt; WHOA.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CUT OFF MY HAND

27:26.111 --> 27:27.812
AND THEN TELL ME
YOU'RE MY FATHER, ARE YOU?

27:27.879 --> 27:29.347
&gt;&gt; NO.

27:29.414 --> 27:30.548
I'M GONNA TRAIN YOU.

27:32.350 --> 27:33.952
I WILL MAKE YOU STRONGER...

27:34.019 --> 27:35.186
HEE-YA!

27:35.253 --> 27:36.654
smack!

27:36.721 --> 27:37.756
FASTER...

27:37.822 --> 27:40.425
HA-HA!

27:40.492 --> 27:42.027
AND SO POWERFUL

27:42.093 --> 27:44.295
THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO CRUSH THE METAL ROBOT DUDE,

27:44.362 --> 27:45.697
GET YOUR PLANET BACK,

27:45.764 --> 27:47.665
AND THEN CRUSH THE DARKNESS.

27:47.732 --> 27:48.767
HA-HA-HA!

27:48.833 --> 27:51.036
ka-pow!

27:51.102 --> 27:52.871
smash!

27:52.937 --> 27:54.139
&gt;&gt; AWESOME!

27:54.205 --> 27:56.574
LOOK OUT, DESTRUCTINATOR
AND THE DARKNESS,

27:56.641 --> 27:58.810
HERE COMES--UH...

27:58.877 --> 28:00.245
&gt;&gt; TURBO TIMMY!

28:00.311 --> 28:01.946
&gt;&gt; TURBO TIMMY!

28:02.013 --> 28:02.881
smash!

28:05.617 --> 28:06.584
&gt;&gt; EEDIE-BEEDIE.

28:06.651 --> 28:08.119
I AM A ROBOT LIKE YOU.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.155
WHAT IS OUR EEDIE-BEEDIE PLAN?

28:10.221 --> 28:12.290
&gt;&gt; WE'RE TRANSFORMING THE EARTH

28:12.357 --> 28:16.895
INTO THE DESTRUCTINATOR'S
SUPER SURPRISE WEAPON.

28:16.961 --> 28:19.330
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT IS
THE SUPER SURPRISE?

28:19.397 --> 28:20.365
thud!

28:22.567 --> 28:24.335
&gt;&gt; OH, JUST AN EARTH
FILLED WITH

28:24.402 --> 28:26.571
20 MILLION GIGATONS
OF EXPLOSIVES

28:26.638 --> 28:30.208
THAT WILL DESTROY THE DARKNESS
IN ITS ONE TRUE WEAK SPOT:

28:30.275 --> 28:31.309
ITS HEART.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.311
[metal crunching]

28:33.378 --> 28:34.479
&gt;&gt; HA HA.
HA HA.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.547
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

28:35.613 --> 28:36.881
I AM NOT A ROBOT AND--

28:36.948 --> 28:38.883
HELP US, CHOSEN ONE!

28:38.950 --> 28:40.218
&gt;&gt; THE DESTRUCTINATOR
WILL BE FAST,

28:40.285 --> 28:42.320
BUT YOU NEED TO BE FASTER.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.556
{\an5}smack!

28:42.387 --> 28:44.556
&gt;&gt; [grunts]

28:44.622 --> 28:45.690
&gt;&gt; HE WILL BE QUICK,

28:45.757 --> 28:47.158
BUT YOU NEED TO BE QUICKER.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.560
UH. UH.

28:48.626 --> 28:49.627
&gt;&gt; [screams]

28:49.694 --> 28:51.329
thud!
thud!

28:51.396 --> 28:52.630
smash!

28:52.697 --> 28:54.699
&gt;&gt; HIS WILL WILL BE MIGHTY,

28:54.766 --> 28:56.568
YOURS MUST BE MIGHTIER AND--

28:56.634 --> 28:58.970
COOCHIE, COOCHIE, COO.

28:59.037 --> 29:00.105
&gt;&gt; [screams]

29:00.171 --> 29:01.606
smash!

29:01.673 --> 29:02.674
I QUIT.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.209
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO QUITTING

29:04.275 --> 29:06.244
WHEN YOUR WORLD
HAS BEEN TURNED TO METAL

29:06.311 --> 29:08.847
AND A SHOWDOWN WITH
THE DESTRUCTINATOR AWAITS YOU.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.281
NOW, GET UP.

29:10.348 --> 29:12.817
&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE SPECIAL POWERS
LIKE YOU.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.352
I'M JUST A NORMAL BOY,

29:14.419 --> 29:16.154
AND I'M TIRED
OF FIGHTING THE DARKNESS,

29:16.221 --> 29:18.156
AND I CAN'T DEFEAT
THE DESTRUCTINATOR WITH MAGIC,

29:18.223 --> 29:19.991
'CAUSE HE HAS MAGIC.

29:20.058 --> 29:22.327
&gt;&gt; OH, I WAS HOPING
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.996
TAKE MY HANDS.

29:25.063 --> 29:27.665
ON SUNS AND STORMS,

29:27.732 --> 29:29.634
TWO PITS OF WONDER,

29:29.701 --> 29:31.202
I TRANSFER TO YOU

29:31.269 --> 29:34.672
MY POWERS OF THUNDER!

29:34.739 --> 29:36.808
[electric sizzling]

29:42.714 --> 29:44.449
&gt;&gt; TIMMY, ARE YOU OKAY?

29:44.516 --> 29:46.751
&gt;&gt; I'M--

29:46.818 --> 29:48.419
