00:36.400 --> 00:37.956
Fuck...

01:06.920 --> 01:08.558
Fuckin' hell!

01:08.720 --> 01:11.154
What's the matter with you? What?

01:11.320 --> 01:14.995
- I'm not a bloody prostitute!
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.316
Christ's sake, this was our second date!

01:17.480 --> 01:19.869
Was it? Listen, listen, all right...

01:20.040 --> 01:22.713
I was on the tequilas
last night and, um...

01:23.680 --> 01:27.070
- What is your name again?
- You're kidding.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.800
Tell you what, if you was a prostitute...

01:29.960 --> 01:31.916
you know... you'd be caked.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.159
What's the matter with you?
That was a compliment!

01:41.320 --> 01:45.074
You know what I mean, I can't win!
I've got the pox of it.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.833
Tell you something else,
you're only an old dog, anyway.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.878
Maybe "boys' weekend,"
wasn't the best choice of words.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.632
Whatever. Have a nice time.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.475
I'm not one of those guys
who ditches his mates for his girlfriend!

01:59.640 --> 02:02.393
- I don't want you to ditch your mates!
- What DO you want?

02:02.560 --> 02:04.471
An invite would've been nice.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.631
No girls allowed, darling.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.070
I didn't know
there was gonna be strippers!

02:17.240 --> 02:20.755
- And Neil's not in charge. I am.
- That fills me with confidence.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.559
I'm only going to my gran's.
I'll be back on Monday.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.870
I'll have the locks changed before then.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.196
Bex, Bex...
It's for Vince. Vince!

02:34.360 --> 02:36.999
He's helped me
out so many times, I've lost count.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.197
When I first came to London,
he supported me. I owe him.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.557
Lots of people get divorced, Mikey.
He'll get over it.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.235
Yes, by spending a weekend
getting trollied with his mates.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.392
Well, you can celebrate
your own divorce with him!

02:50.560 --> 02:53.711
I thought you'd react like that,
so I glued your ring on.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.998
- See you Monday, babe. Love you too!
- Mikey, if you walk out that gate...

03:01.480 --> 03:04.756
You don't know whether
you're coming or going, do you?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.237
Patrick!

03:10.480 --> 03:11.993
I'm going. I'm going!

03:12.160 --> 03:14.435
The first weekend
my parents visit in years,

03:14.600 --> 03:18.036
and you bugger off to the wilderness
to rediscover your testicles!

03:18.200 --> 03:21.317
It's bad enough I have to tell them
you've quit your job...

03:21.480 --> 03:24.119
<i>Welcome to Sonic Stress Therapy.</i>

03:24.280 --> 03:29.070
<i>It's going to be a beautiful day.
Let's start it with a smile.</i>

03:29.240 --> 03:33.153
<i>- Anxiety is almost the same...
- Are you just gonna fucking go?</i>

03:56.960 --> 03:58.951
<i>No, no.</i>

03:59.120 --> 04:04.877
It's a symbol of his identity, and the
source of his primeval inner strength.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.032
So how come the Zombie Girls
kick his arse on page 4?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.998
How many times have I told you
they're NOT zombies?!

04:11.160 --> 04:16.439
- All right, calm down. It's only a comic.
- No, no, it's not only a comic.

04:16.600 --> 04:21.036
This is a... It's a unique
and often misunderstood art form.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.590
This... is a painstakingly crafted,

04:24.760 --> 04:29.151
and carefully balanced alignment
of words and art, OK?

04:29.320 --> 04:32.357
- What, like TV?
- Do you want it or not?

04:32.520 --> 04:35.830
- No, it's stupid.
- Right, piss off!

04:36.000 --> 04:39.629
- Go on. We're closing early, OK?
- What? Why?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.678
<i>Spaceltime anomaly.</i>

04:42.840 --> 04:46.037
You mean... you want
a bit of time alone with your missus.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.395
Don't touch her. Get off her and get out!

04:49.560 --> 04:50.994
Go on, then!

04:51.160 --> 04:53.390
Go on, out!
And don't come back!

04:55.080 --> 04:57.071
Little knob-end.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.476
Vince, you're not getting out of this!

05:07.640 --> 05:11.633
- You're coming with us!
- We're gonna have such a good time!

05:16.080 --> 05:18.469
Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!

05:26.680 --> 05:28.796
Oh, you bastard!

05:31.080 --> 05:32.399
Bastard!

05:36.440 --> 05:37.668
Bastard!

05:39.720 --> 05:41.551
Bastard!

05:44.320 --> 05:45.726
Bastard!

06:10.040 --> 06:14.909
(THE HORRORS' She Is The New Thing)

06:25.160 --> 06:27.515
<i># She's a special girl, you know</i>

06:27.680 --> 06:31.468
<i># The kind I'd hope to see
Hanging on a wall</i>

06:31.640 --> 06:33.790
<i># Watching me cross the street</i>

06:40.480 --> 06:42.914
<i># I wonder how long it will be</i>

06:43.080 --> 06:46.914
<i># Before I'm sick of her
And I no longer care</i>

06:47.080 --> 06:48.672
<i># Where she goes or has been</i>

06:48.840 --> 06:50.558
<i># Cause she's the new thing</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:52.517
<i># Cause she's the new thing</i>

06:52.680 --> 06:54.352
<i># She is the new thing</i>

06:54.520 --> 06:56.511
<i># Well, she's the new thing</i>

07:02.200 --> 07:04.191
<i># She is the new thing</i>

07:04.360 --> 07:06.032
<i># She is the new thing</i>

07:06.320 --> 07:07.992
<i># Another new thing</i>

07:08.160 --> 07:11.755
<i># Feel my stomach sink
As I curse my slow limbs</i>

07:11.920 --> 07:13.592
<i># She is the new thing</i>

07:13.760 --> 07:15.751
<i># Always a new thing</i>

07:15.920 --> 07:19.515
<i># Staring at her, ulterior girl</i>

07:22.320 --> 07:23.799
Thanks.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.679
- Vince, you left this behind, mate.
- Ta.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.559
- I thought you'd given up.
- I have.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.154
- Where's Banksy?
- Late.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.550
He's always late for everything.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.711
He showed up on time for his wedding.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.038
Why's that funny?

07:41.200 --> 07:45.512
Well, he showed up, and...
she didn't show up at all.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.035
Lucky bastard!

07:48.200 --> 07:50.668
Here, I'll give him call.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.630
Oh, shit!

08:19.360 --> 08:21.828
<i>... you're through to Banksy Electrical.</i>

08:22.000 --> 08:25.310
<i>Please leave your name and number
after the tone, and I'll...</i>

08:27.020 --> 08:29.030
Banksy, you're wanker.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.838
Hurry up!

08:31.000 --> 08:33.116
Liven yourself up, lazy-bollocks!

08:34.760 --> 08:37.193
Hey, Pat, what's with
them golf clubs, man?

08:37.360 --> 08:40.033
There's no golf courses
where we're going.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.510
That's why have this bag...
my little friend.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.671
You know there's more
to life than football.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.876
- All you need is the open air...
- Me nuts!

08:49.440 --> 08:52.989
I don't think your new-age
golf therapy is gonna work on Vince, Pat.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.196
Vince is real man, Pat, not like you.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.920
You should've seen him
in his glory days, Mikey.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.755
I mean, they used to call him Fearless.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.357
He would step out in front of
a raging bull just to protect his mates,

09:06.520 --> 09:10.229
and still manage to buy the first round
from his hospital bed.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.393
Yeah, that's only 'cause you guys
picked up what was left in me wallet.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.233
- We helped you.
- Go on, show Mikey.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.710
- Oh, yeah, look at this!
- Let's have a look.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.795
Pamplona Bull Run '96. He screamed
like a girl the whole way around.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.951
I wish I was there, man...

09:29.120 --> 09:30.348
Shit!

09:32.480 --> 09:35.119
Sorry, mate, seriously.
Let me just...

09:35.280 --> 09:37.555
Anyway, where were we?

09:57.120 --> 09:58.712
Snap out of it, Vince.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.350
Today you re-discover your inner bloke.
You don't wanna miss it.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.511
Me inner bloke's all right, thanks.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.433
He's not, though, is he?
He's lost his way.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.991
We all have.
All suffering from social gender anxiety.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.116
Is that some sort of disease
or something?

10:15.280 --> 10:17.157
Nobody knows, that's the problem.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.312
The second you try
to figure it out... doomed.

10:21.640 --> 10:25.918
Not you, Vince. We're gonna
bring you back from the brink.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.278
- Oi, no smoking!
- Shut up.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.956
- You're outnumbered.
- I'm terrified!

10:36.120 --> 10:37.872
Slag.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.315
- Charmer...
- Wha'? Wha'?

10:40.480 --> 10:44.075
- Now, listen to me, boys...
- I thought it was funny.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.878
This is the plan.

10:46.040 --> 10:50.591
First thing we do in the country,
we piss up the trees, mark our territory.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.514
Then we're gonna find a pub and drink
till we've forgotten how to speak.

10:54.680 --> 10:59.276
We'll communicate in grunts like
cavemen, until we pass out in the woods.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.956
Any questions?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.871
- Are you Michael? I'm the driver.
- Hey, she's the driver!

11:08.080 --> 11:10.310
Wanna see my driver's license?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.869
That's Mikey,
the little squirt sitting there.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.437
I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.556
I can tell you now it's not "babe".

11:24.020 --> 11:26.678
It's gonna be a long drive, isn't it?

11:26.840 --> 11:29.354
Looks like it's heading that way,
don't it?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.954
I tell you what, let's start again.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.554
- My name's Neil.
- My name's Ruth.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.549
From now on it's Candy.

11:39.720 --> 11:43.713
Ignore him, RUTH. He's a throwback.
He hasn't evolved properly.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.876
Call me Candy.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.357
Come on!

12:04.360 --> 12:06.999
- Right, boys, you ready?
- Yeah!

12:07.160 --> 12:10.709
Get on these 2 here, look.
A couple of right wrong 'uns.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.597
I'll tell you what, women love me.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.550
You got enough petrol, babe,
and all that, yeah?

12:19.120 --> 12:22.157
- Have you called Banksy again?
- He'll show up.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.710
He's like Mikey's missus.
You can't shake him off.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.469
It looks nice, but it's a piece of shit.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.437
- What?
- It's fucked.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.397
But I've only had it 5 minutes.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.997
Someone's run the knackers off it.
You can't fix that with a nice paint job.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.399
You're the one
who's getting divorced, ain't you?

12:53.560 --> 12:55.198
Thanks for bringing it up.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.113
There's worse things
than getting divorced.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.113
Rape, murder, castration.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.635
Fair enough.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.349
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?

13:07.520 --> 13:11.035
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.872
What do you mean weird?

13:13.040 --> 13:15.554
Well, it's just a dead-end
in the middle of the woods.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.598
There's nothing there.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.069
When I saw the booking
I thought it was a wind-up.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.913
Mikey says the women
outnumber the men 4 to 1.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.675
Yes, they do, Neil.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.318
- And obviously they're all gagging for it.
- Obviously.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.675
An entire village
full of man-hungry women

13:31.840 --> 13:34.957
waiting to jump the first band
of desperados rolling up from London.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.870
Have you been there, then?

13:37.440 --> 13:40.079
My firm hasn't booked
a job to Moodley in years.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.672
Oh, sod off.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.670
<i>Don't fear. There's no cause for alarm.</i>

13:47.840 --> 13:50.035
All is well.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.998
Death is a natural part of life.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.994
Anxiety about this
is an inbuilt survival reflex,

13:57.160 --> 14:03.076
no longer required in this beautiful
predator-free world.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.910
Welcome to the country.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.356
I'll do it, then, shall I?

14:32.720 --> 14:34.119
Yeah, well done.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.598
What's your nana up to
this weekend, Mikey?

14:42.760 --> 14:45.149
She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.276
What builders?

14:47.440 --> 14:50.352
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.398
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.358
- She doesn't know we're coming.
- Well... I did say...

14:56.520 --> 15:00.832
- You fuckin' idiot.
- Listen, man, I know where the key is!

15:01.000 --> 15:03.150
Jesus! This gets better and better.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.551
I might just stay on the minibus
and wait for the return trip.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.157
Gentlemen, you are all past
the point of no return.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.550
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mikey.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.517
It's not me. It's not me!

15:21.280 --> 15:23.555
Hello? Yeah...

15:23.720 --> 15:26.075
I told you I'd sign the papers.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.310
Solicitors always say that.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.040
I can't do nothing today.
I'm not in London.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.874
Moodley... Moodley!

15:35.040 --> 15:37.235
What do you mean it's a shit hole?

15:39.560 --> 15:41.437
Hello? Hello?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.034
Not my PS...

15:49.200 --> 15:52.909
That's it. Give us that fucking thing.
I've had enough of this!

15:53.200 --> 15:56.875
- I'm not having this.
- What are you gonna do?

15:57.040 --> 16:01.079
- All the phones, off, in this bag.
- What?!

16:01.240 --> 16:03.879
- OK? All of you. Come on!
- No, no, no.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.555
Getting away from it all doesn't include
spousal abuse by T-Mobile.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.712
- See you, darling.
- I need to ring my mum.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.156
- You've got mine already.
- In the bag, sunshine.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.114
- Ladies first.
- After you, then.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.591
All right.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.350
Mikey?! Is this it?

16:55.520 --> 16:59.513
- Please tell me you took a wrong turn.
- Told you the place was a dead end.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.240
Is that it? Is this?

17:02.400 --> 17:04.196
Mikey!

17:12.760 --> 17:15.035
We're in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.318
I'd leave all that, Mikey,
till we've done a bit of reconnaissance.

17:19.560 --> 17:24.156
- We might not be staying.
- What do you mean not staying?

17:24.319 --> 17:27.392
I'm off the clock for half an hour,
then I'm leaving...

17:27.560 --> 17:29.551
with or without you.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.477
Fiddlesticks!

17:43.920 --> 17:45.751
On your head!

17:47.360 --> 17:50.238
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You idiot!

17:59.280 --> 18:02.909
I'm sure this place used to be bigger
when I was, err... little.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.432
Looks like the whole village
has fucked off with your nan.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.591
Where's all the women, then?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.990
When were you last here, Mikey?

18:13.160 --> 18:17.836
- Well, it's been a few years.
- Right, come on. First things first.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.516
Mikey, you break into your nan's house
and make sure I've got a bed for tonight.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.752
The rest of us can get the beers in
at the... Cock & Bull,

18:25.920 --> 18:28.514
and drink until Moodley
starts looking like Barbados.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.671
And someone
go get Candy down for a drink.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.512
I'll go.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.309
Neil, if she sees you,
she's liable to drive away with our stuff.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.790
What are you talking about?
Women love me.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.313
Really?

18:41.480 --> 18:44.711
You are a long way from
your sports car, though, aren't you?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.913
I'm gonna go for a slash.
Get us a pint of the usual.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.799
Oh, no, put your money away, Neil.
My shout!

18:59.120 --> 19:00.997
Knob.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.031
"Vote Meg Nut".

19:30.200 --> 19:32.953
Meg Nut... Nut-meg...

19:33.960 --> 19:35.996
"Sponsored by Wundawash. "

20:03.440 --> 20:05.396
Oh, shit.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.515
Yes! Yes, yes.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.556
Oh, thank you, gnomie.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.793
Hello?

20:46.960 --> 20:50.157
I can't believe we jumped
on one of Mikey's schemes.

20:50.320 --> 20:54.074
- His heart's in the right place.
- Shame his head is up his arse.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.232
Come on, Pat.
Liven yourself up. Get 'em in.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.755
Neil, Do you see any bar staff?

20:59.920 --> 21:02.593
I think I just saw one in the khazi,
chucking up.

21:02.760 --> 21:07.311
- Maybe they're all sick.
- What the fuck is that horrible stench?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.552
It's the smoking ban, mate.
Get rid of the all the puffers,

21:10.720 --> 21:14.395
you'll find out what a pub really
smells like - stale beer and piss.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.994
No. It's something else.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.352
Where the fuck's Matt?

21:36.920 --> 21:39.195
All right, calm down.
You sound like a dolphin.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.078
Idiot.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.800
Look at that.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.914
It's a knob in a box.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.437
This is a joke, right?

22:10.520 --> 22:12.317
Don't...

22:13.440 --> 22:15.635
Hey, back up. Back up.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.028
I will...

22:21.360 --> 22:24.591
Looks like there is
life on Mars, after all.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.158
- What's the matter with her?
- I think she's homeless.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.757
300 miles from London, the only
person we see is selling the Big Issue.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.833
- Let's get some change.
- I've got some, I've got some.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.795
Hey! Hey!

22:53.440 --> 22:55.158
Go Vince!

22:58.560 --> 23:00.835
- It's not what it looks like, mate!
- Yeah?

23:01.960 --> 23:04.110
Matt, call the police!

23:08.000 --> 23:09.433
Go, Graham. Hit him!

23:15.880 --> 23:18.075
Go on! Somebody else hit him!

23:21.400 --> 23:23.755
Put the knife down, mate.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.354
Put the knife down!

23:30.400 --> 23:32.595
You lot, just listen to me!

23:38.120 --> 23:39.997
- Hey, watch!
- She stabbed me!

23:40.160 --> 23:41.912
All right, hey, hey!

23:42.840 --> 23:44.876
- Oi! Oi!
- What are you doing?!

23:46.840 --> 23:48.876
- Can we talk about this?
- Hang on, hang on.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.433
Jesus...

24:01.160 --> 24:04.197
- What... What's wrong with her?
- What do you mean?

24:04.360 --> 24:08.239
She's like Evil Dead in your shop,
those things with the claws and teeth!

24:09.720 --> 24:12.190
And she's not the only one.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.394
Look! Look at that. Look, look.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.874
- Back on the bus, then, eh?
- Yes, yes!

24:28.880 --> 24:31.269
- What about Action Man?
- Oh, shit.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.590
Come on! Leave him!

24:41.680 --> 24:44.672
Candy, start her up, baby.
We're leaving.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.200
Let's go somewhere else, then.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.552
Yeah, OK.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.552
Where's your nan's house, Mike?

25:00.480 --> 25:03.233
Mike, your nan's house!

25:07.080 --> 25:08.479
OK...

25:11.640 --> 25:14.074
Let's take the scenic route.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.150
Mikey... Get his gun.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.191
YOU get it.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.629
It's empty.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.438
Oh, mate...

26:06.600 --> 26:08.477
That is not cool...

26:08.640 --> 26:10.790
Look at the state of him.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.955
What?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.391
He said, "Don't go in the woods. "

26:21.560 --> 26:23.596
- Why?
- Why you asking me?

26:28.480 --> 26:30.675
What's in the woods?

26:30.840 --> 26:33.308
Everything... you've ever been afraid of.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.432
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

26:45.400 --> 26:47.470
Quick, quick, Graham!

26:47.640 --> 26:50.598
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm gonna do it when I get the key!

26:50.760 --> 26:53.479
These are multi-combat trousers!
They've got 11 pockets!

27:00.520 --> 27:02.670
You missed her!

27:04.800 --> 27:06.279
Open the fucking door!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.433
- Vince!
- What?

27:16.600 --> 27:17.794
Help me!

27:21.880 --> 27:23.871
- I've got the key!
- OPEN IT, THEN!

27:31.560 --> 27:33.630
Shut the back door!

27:41.600 --> 27:42.999
Oi, oi!

27:43.160 --> 27:45.116
They're moving away!

27:50.200 --> 27:55.035
All right, you funny cunts,
how's this supposed to cheer me up?

28:07.640 --> 28:10.757
- Phones are dead.
- "Let's put all the mobiles in a bag. "

28:10.920 --> 28:13.912
- Good idea, Neil!
- You wanna talk about this some more?

28:14.080 --> 28:17.675
Let's talk about the unliveable state
of this house we're staying in.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.274
OK, back door's locked, kettle is on.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.919
Neil.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.234
- They're not coming back.
- So what's going on here?

28:31.240 --> 28:34.232
It could be some kind of
chemical spillage.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.834
Maybe one of the streams
has been polluted.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.036
Patrick, when was the last time

28:39.200 --> 28:43.512
you saw pollution turn somebody
into an axe murderer?

28:44.520 --> 28:48.069
Candy didn't even get off the bus
and she still turned into that.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.795
- So it must be in the air.
- Why haven't we got it? And him?

28:52.960 --> 28:56.839
- Maybe only women get it.
- What kind of virus only affects women?

28:58.360 --> 28:59.813
Bird flu.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.156
So where did all the men go?

29:10.040 --> 29:11.553
No, no, no!

29:14.080 --> 29:15.798
What is it?

29:23.320 --> 29:25.834
Are you fucking retarded?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.150
All the men are dead.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.915
- Sit down, Andy McNabb.
- Easy, mate. I'm not the enemy.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.469
- Really? See, I think you are.
- Right...

29:34.640 --> 29:37.996
We demand an explanation!

29:38.160 --> 29:40.594
Is it a biological weapon
gone out of control?

29:40.760 --> 29:42.432
It's classified is what it is.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.319
It's hardly classified, mate,
it's running about in stilettos!

29:45.480 --> 29:48.631
- I said sit down.
- Or what? Or what?

29:50.960 --> 29:53.030
Oi! Oi! Oi!

29:55.360 --> 29:57.191
Kettle's boiled.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.234
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Gavin Wright.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.870
We don't give fuck about your rank.
We want an explanation.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.508
- It's virus.
- Why aren't we infected?

30:14.680 --> 30:17.592
I thought you'd worked this one out.
Only women get it.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.228
- Why?
- Just luck.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.755
Oh, that's not funny. Is there a cure?

30:22.920 --> 30:25.559
I don't think anybody
survived long enough to try.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.518
But that's not my department.
I'm just here to shoot them.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.957
- What?
- How did it start?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.315
The only questions you need to ask are,

30:34.480 --> 30:37.074
"How many are there?"
and, "Are they in our way?"

30:37.240 --> 30:38.832
So, how many are there?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.275
The whole village
has gone over to the dark side.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.749
Most of them are out in the woods.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.037
So if you're thinking
of hiking out of here, think again.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.589
What the fuck are they doing
in the woods?

30:49.760 --> 30:53.958
Maybe they're all taking a shit.
Women like to go to the toilet together.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.715
What do you think they're doing?
They're looking for fresh meat.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.029
- So what's your exit plan?
- Same as yours.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.397
Get on the minibus
and fuck off out the way you came in.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.233
Well, there's little problem
with your plan, Marvin.

31:07.400 --> 31:12.076
Bad Candy lives on that bus.
And she's got a little skin complaint.

31:25.560 --> 31:30.111
When she gets off the bus, start running
and don't stop until you hear the horn.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.157
We'll come back and pick you up.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.993
Why are you so sure
she's gonna follow me?

31:35.160 --> 31:37.071
Women love you.

31:38.560 --> 31:42.519
If you have to kill her, just do it.
She's not Candy anymore.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.433
She never was. Her name's Ruth.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.795
- Whatever.
- Well, stop calling her Candy.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.838
Neil, now is not the time
to stop objectifying women.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.672
Be new man tomorrow.

31:53.840 --> 31:58.675
Today, we need you to be the misogynist
Neanderthal arsehole we know and love.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.276
- You could get this virus next...
- Fuck off.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.396
You even hit like a girl.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.031
- What are you doing?
- Fucking go.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.236
- Liberty-taker.
- Hurry up!

32:09.400 --> 32:11.277
All right, I'm going.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.108
Come on... Come and have a nibble.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.714
You know you want it.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.751
Bollocks.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.113
Get off the...

32:48.280 --> 32:51.352
- Go! Go!
- Quick, hurry up!

33:01.560 --> 33:03.471
Get the phones!

33:03.640 --> 33:05.039
Someone get the phones!

33:13.320 --> 33:14.799
Bastards!

33:30.420 --> 33:32.115
Fuckin' hell!

34:00.240 --> 34:03.471
Oh, man. We are dog meat.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.600
They're everywhere!

34:07.760 --> 34:09.670
- Shit...
- Oh, man!

34:12.440 --> 34:13.873
Julie?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.518
Do you know her?

34:18.400 --> 34:21.152
Yeah, yeah...
We had thing once, it didn't end well.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.918
- I'm gonna be sick.
- How do you think I feel?!

34:29.760 --> 34:32.991
The phones...
I've got the fucking phones!

34:33.159 --> 34:34.717
Shit...

34:36.000 --> 34:39.708
- Do something! You're the soldier!
- Look at the fucking size of her!

34:41.560 --> 34:43.232
Oh, no...

34:45.480 --> 34:47.118
Get her off me!

34:52.040 --> 34:54.076
Look out, Vince. Look out!

34:58.960 --> 35:00.598
Fuck! Come on!

35:13.240 --> 35:14.639
Yeah!

35:24.120 --> 35:25.758
Oh, look at your teeth!

35:29.200 --> 35:31.111
Fuckin' hell! Patrick!

35:47.440 --> 35:50.512
- We should start placing bets.
- My money's on that one.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.517
Let's go!

35:58.240 --> 36:00.037
Everyone stay together!

36:00.640 --> 36:02.676
Here, here! Quick, come on.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.551
Fuckin' hell.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.550
(Match Of The Day)

37:11.240 --> 37:15.472
She'll be through that freakin' window
in a minute. Grab anything you can.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.637
- Vince!
- What?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.674
Still in its original packaging!

37:29.880 --> 37:32.792
Weapons, Matt.
Grab any weapons you can.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.269
Not fuckin' robots.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.476
All right... I'm looking.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.076
Did you lock that?

37:49.680 --> 37:51.079
Matt! Matt!

37:51.240 --> 37:52.912
Where are you going? Matt!

37:54.720 --> 37:56.711
I'm coming!

37:57.960 --> 37:59.837
Weapons... Weapons...

38:01.800 --> 38:03.791
Matt! Matt!

38:03.960 --> 38:06.758
- What are you doing?
- Give us a lighter!

38:06.920 --> 38:09.070
In me pocket...
THE OTHER POCKET!

38:17.640 --> 38:20.916
Get back. If they can't see us,
they'll forget we're in here.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.753
- That's optimistic, innit?
- They are easily confused.

38:39.920 --> 38:43.515
NOW you decide to shoot someone,
you fucking monkey's arse-ring.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.193
You had a gun all along?

38:47.240 --> 38:50.357
I was saving the last bullet
for when I needed it.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.238
You're still a twat.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.638
Fuck, I think you've just sent out
a party invite.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.309
Do they sell petrol in toy shops?

39:04.480 --> 39:05.879
No.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.998
It's Nitro Fluid for radio-controlled cars.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.997
Don't you know anything?!

39:13.160 --> 39:17.676
I know we need to be tooled up with
something that wasn't made in Taiwan.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.234
Who taught you to drive?
Let me have a go.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.593
Get off!

39:53.840 --> 39:55.558
Reverse. Reverse. Over here!

40:07.200 --> 40:10.033
<i>Hello? Are we in there?</i>

40:10.200 --> 40:13.476
- I take it you're in a toy shop.
- Who's there? Is Neil there?

40:13.640 --> 40:15.790
No, just me, Mikey
and the Milky Bar Kid.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.757
- My name's Gavin.
- Whatever.

40:17.920 --> 40:20.832
The speed Neil was running,
he's probably halfway home.

40:52.560 --> 40:56.030
Why don't we forget about all this?
This finger food.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.591
That's a really lovely spread.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.752
But why don't we
just take this upstairs, eh?

41:06.360 --> 41:08.316
We're both adults.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.437
I'm a man...

41:13.560 --> 41:15.149
You're a...

41:18.760 --> 41:20.557
You're a woman.

41:22.720 --> 41:25.951
This could be the start
of something special - you and me...

41:26.960 --> 41:29.269
All you've gotta do...

41:30.280 --> 41:32.635
is... untie me, yeah?

41:37.120 --> 41:39.475
Just untie me, please.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.556
Come on, then. Come on!

42:01.520 --> 42:04.478
No, no, don't do that. No.

So, what's the plan?

42:26.520 --> 42:28.750
What do you mean what's the plan?

42:28.920 --> 42:31.070
The plan. What's the plan?

42:31.240 --> 42:34.038
- I haven't got one. What's yours?
- I've got a plan.

42:34.200 --> 42:37.158
What's all this bollocks
with the walkie-talkies, then?

42:37.320 --> 42:40.676
Just fancied a chat about
something other than Star Wars.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.956
Oh... How is Matt?

42:47.320 --> 42:49.436
Yeah, the force is with him.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.916
- Oi!
- What?

42:59.080 --> 43:00.593
I said I've got a plan.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.519
Go on, then.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.148
You're the double hard bastard.
You do it.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.197
It's your plan, arsehole.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.396
You two are so gay!

43:16.640 --> 43:18.596
Your mum's an arsehole.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.830
The head's in the truck, man.
You ready?

43:38.920 --> 43:41.912
We're gonna need a diversion
for our diversion.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.399
I'm on it.

No!

44:57.240 --> 44:58.639
Fuck off!

45:00.520 --> 45:02.309
Do the horn.

45:05.320 --> 45:08.039
You're not getting the better of me.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.711
Turn it, you're gonna go
out of range!

45:15.880 --> 45:18.110
I'm turning it. I'm turning it!

45:18.280 --> 45:20.396
Get off!

45:22.960 --> 45:24.678
Oh, f... No!

45:31.760 --> 45:34.194
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Fuckin' hell.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.710
Fucking thing!

45:47.320 --> 45:50.198
- How could things get any worse?
- Mikey?

45:51.320 --> 45:54.232
- Yeah?
- Mikey, they've spotted you.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.599
Great.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.510
Yum!

Mikey!

47:05.720 --> 47:07.073
Fuck.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.754
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, wait. Wait.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.798
I am not going out there half-cocked.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.036
Let's party.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.311
Where's mine?

47:21.000 --> 47:23.195
Well, there's only one.

47:24.680 --> 47:26.750
No, look, got a spare.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.079
No?

47:32.880 --> 47:35.030
All right, you can have my backup.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.273
What's this?

47:39.760 --> 47:41.910
I will make you feel sexy.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.353
Yeah!

47:44.920 --> 47:48.230
Right, then. Come on, Vince.
Me and you - Butch and Sundance!

47:48.400 --> 47:51.073
- They both died.
- Yeah!

47:51.240 --> 47:53.834
- Come on, you gimp. Let's go.
- Yeah!

48:07.320 --> 48:09.914
Do your fire thing! Do the fire thing!

48:10.080 --> 48:11.399

Oh, shit!

49:27.400 --> 49:29.072
Ta.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.639
What do we do now?

49:34.800 --> 49:38.190
We do what everyone else does,
when they're facing mortality.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.032
Run.

49:42.920 --> 49:46.595
Wait, wait.
I bet you a tenner it's locked.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.280
- Bollocks.
- You owe me tenner.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.316
Oh, my God.

- Lads, can you hear me?

50:20.480 --> 50:24.075
Me and Matt, we're in the church
but we've lock ed the doors.

50:24.240 --> 50:28.631
So if you get over here, please
just let me know. Try and get over here.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.231
We have to get out of here.

50:37.400 --> 50:40.790
Let's follow your mates over
to the church. It's our best chance.

50:40.960 --> 50:43.872
I think it's a bit late
to start praying, don't you?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.833
You feeling all right, mate?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.389
I have just had a genius idea.

50:50.560 --> 50:55.111
- Is everyone ready?
- You're loving this, aren't you?

50:55.280 --> 50:57.271
- Garry?
- It's Gavin.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.476
Let's just get it over with.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.634
- What?
- You've done this before, haven't you?

51:05.800 --> 51:09.076
- Don't get any funny ideas
- Don't worry, he's not a lesbian.

51:09.240 --> 51:12.755
- Is this gonna work or what?
- Let's try.

51:13.720 --> 51:15.950
Here she is!

51:40.280 --> 51:42.874
Vince, open the church door.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.718
Oh, fuck.

51:59.800 --> 52:02.473
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, come on!

52:03.400 --> 52:06.119
No, no, no! Don't go in there!
Don't go in there!

52:31.080 --> 52:32.957
Wait! That's my 9-iron.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.279
Come on!

52:46.920 --> 52:50.310
- Oh, Christ, it's the ex.
- Vince, we're outside. Open the door.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.914
Don't move, just keep smiling.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.071
Our clothes are in there! Shit!

52:59.320 --> 53:02.437
Oh, for fuck's sake, Julie.
We split up, get over it!

53:07.120 --> 53:09.111
All right, gays... guys!

53:10.120 --> 53:13.829
- Where did you come from?
- I took the scenic route.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.877
Come on.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.991
I hate you. I hate you.

53:22.240 --> 53:26.950
Why don't you just sit on me
and get it over with, you fat fucking pig!

53:54.440 --> 53:56.431
Vince.

53:56.600 --> 54:00.275
- I really wanna go home.
- OK. OK, let's go.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.151
Let's go home.

Vince, are you taking piss?
This isn't funny any more.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.350
- Let us in.
- Hold on, we're coming.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.633
- Come on, hurry up!
- What are they doing?

54:15.800 --> 54:18.633
- What are you doing...
- What the fuck's this?!

54:19.200 --> 54:21.473
- Don't laugh at me!
- Neil! Neil!

Show's over. Everyone get inside.

55:13.440 --> 55:16.352
- I don't think so.
- Is that supposed to frighten me?

- He said it would make me fell sexy.
- Does it?

That's it.

Sit down, silly-bollocks,
you look gorgeous.

56:08.520 --> 56:14.038
- I think that butcher took a shine to you.
- Nah, she's not my type, that one.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.838
What about one of the others?

56:16.000 --> 56:19.117
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Don't you ever have a day off?

56:19.280 --> 56:23.193
There were 3 kinky birds

with that sicking-up bollocks...

scissors is pretty fit.

Oh, come on, Graham.
That's why you bat for the other side?

56:47.040 --> 56:49.270
All women are mental.

56:49.440 --> 56:53.752
You can't make that kind of sweeping
generalisation about an entire gender.

56:53.920 --> 56:56.718
Why not? Look at us.

56:56.880 --> 57:00.919
Look at Vince. His glory days are over.
His missus did that to him.

57:01.080 --> 57:04.789
He was king when he met her.
She turned him into a fucking ghost.

57:04.960 --> 57:09.238
We brought him out here to convince
him that all women aren't out to get him.

Yeah, thanks for that, lads.

- Yes.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.837
This.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.991
I've done it!

57:26.160 --> 57:27.957
Right.

57:32.800 --> 57:35.997
Wow, we've got the whole village
under surveillance.

57:42.920 --> 57:45.480
Well, it's about time.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.154
You've been offline for nearly 24 hours.

57:48.320 --> 57:52.279
And why was my so-called escort
called back to Moodley last night,

57:52.440 --> 57:55.557
and left me chained
to the fucking briefcase?

57:55.720 --> 57:59.315
That's Meg Nut from the poster, look.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.831
Who are you?

58:07.880 --> 58:10.872
You're not involved
with Project Cat-house.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.156
Where's the Colonel?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.514
- Get her back.
- It's on fire.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.798
It's happening.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.832
- What's happening?
- Phase II.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.675
Hold on a minute. What's Phase I?

58:40.840 --> 58:44.389
Sickness, disorientation, psychosis.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.471
Phase II is the mutation.

58:46.640 --> 58:50.633
They're gonna get smarter,
faster and weirder.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.628
- What's that?
- It's called The Dolphin.

59:15.800 --> 59:18.872
There are high-frequency
sonic deterrents all over the village,

59:19.040 --> 59:21.235
emitting painful sound
only women can hear.

59:21.400 --> 59:24.995
- So there was a fail-safe all along.
- It only works after Phase II.

59:25.160 --> 59:28.277
- Obviously.
- Well, stop talking and press the button.

59:40.680 --> 59:42.796
- Is it working?
- I dunno.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.677
Can YOU hear it?

59:50.200 --> 59:52.316
Um, that doesn't work, does it?

59:52.480 --> 59:54.869
This isn't funny.
They'll be relentless now.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.871
They hunt in packs. We are fucked!

59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.670
For the sake of clarity, we're not dealing
with few insane women any more.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.070
What you boys
have actually created here

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.472
is an army of pissed off,
man-hating, feminist cannibals.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.997
This biological weapon can turn one half
of the population against the other.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.631
- We can fight wars with no armies.
- So this is a test run?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.553
You set the virus loose
in an isolated little village

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.790
and then sit and watch it on the telly?

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.236
They used to do this kind of thing
in the '50s with LSD.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.597
Thanks, Matthew. What does
Meg Nut have to do with this?

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.356
- Not much. She's just a delivery girl.
- Yeah. But delivering WHAT?

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.671
How fucking stupid are you people?
What do you think?

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.831
A free box of Wundawash?

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.239
The virus
is in the washing powder, look.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.913
It's biological.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.278
Everybody, get back.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.789
- Leave her out of it. That's my nan.
- I thought she was on a cruise.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.678
Yeah... So did I.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.476
Matt. Matt, no!

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.229
You've, um...

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.356
There's some stuff on your face.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.595
All right, Matt?

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.076
Thank you.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.360
Don't go in there, Matt.
It's the mortuary.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.351
I think he's traumatised.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.752
I'm the one who's fucking traumatised!
Look what he did to my nan.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.990
Matt? Matt?

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.912
Matt...

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.358
Vince. Run, run!

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.550
What's happened?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.438
Is he all right?

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.511
No.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.148
So, where is he, then?

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.754
He's dead.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.951
Come on!

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.751
That's for Matt...

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.796
bitch.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.111
Shit, shit...

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.714
- Look at the state of him.
- We can't just leave him here.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.872
What, in mortuary?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.589
I'm just as freaked out as you are.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.757
What was that?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.637
Vince, don't go down there,
that's how she got in.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.878
Yeah, and it might be our only way out.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.317
- It's the other half of Moodley.
- Jesus, it's all the men.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.278
- You mean parts of them.
- It's a nest.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.791
Come on, come on!

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.990
- Get up, come on!
- Get up!

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.231
Get up the stairs! Come on!

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.236
Vince, Vince! Come on!

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.358
- Neil! Neil!
- Close the door!

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.192
Neil, give us a hand with this!

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.956
Hurry up, will ya?

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.474
Oi, what are you pair of tarts
doing up there?

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.632
Banksy, what time do you call this?

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.314
You would not believe
the shit day I've had.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.156
- What's going on?
- Listen, soft-lad,

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.598
outside Mikey's nan's house, there's
a big ladder, go and bring it back here.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.512
What's with the...

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.956
- Get the fucking ladder, soppy bollocks.
- Hurry up.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.032
All right, all right,
don't get all aggressive.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.915
Fuck, help me out!

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.799
- Get your ass outside.
- I think I'll stay a bit.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.191
Get your ass outside now.
Go, fuck off.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.758
Pat, go on.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.911
- All right?
- Vince?

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.991
Hurry up!

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.636
I can see your bikini line from here.
What's with the frock?

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.040
- What are you doing?
- Vince said a get ladder.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.998
So we can get down, you plank,
not so you can get up.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.799
- What's happening?
- All the women have gone evil.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.430
One of them ate Neil's finger,
Matt killed me nan with a 9-iron

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.229
and now he's dead, and we need
to get down the sodding ladder. Down.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.516
You lot been taking drugs?

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.677
- You got some left?
- Get down, get down!

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.558
Move, move!

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.316
Go back up!

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.032
We're alive!

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.432
Let go!

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.232
Who's the monster?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.960
- What are you still doing here?
- Wishing I wasn't.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.959
- Come on!
- Come on, Pat. Come here.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.997
- Come on, Pat.
- Watch his leg!

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.638
- Graham, come on, let's go.
- You go.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.268
I'm right behind you.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.398
Fuck me.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.598
Fuckin' hell.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.832
This is worse than
the fucking Pamplona Bull Run.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.270
Fuckin' hell!

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.438
Jesus!

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.390
- Get the ladder. Get the ladder.
- What's this one?

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.792
Come on!

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.591
- Come on!
- Vince, Vince...

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.199
- Banksy, give us your phone.
- I left it at home.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.669
Right, of course, yeah...

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.432
Where are you parked, then?

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.239
Behind the big billboard lying
across the street.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.551
What's that?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.632
- It's a rental.
- It's a rental?

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.034
What do you mean it's a rental?
Where's your van?

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.191
- It broke down, I forgot.
- You forgot?

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.715
Repeating everything I say
ain't gonna help, Vince.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.440
What's not gonna help
is that fuckin' moon buggy.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.319
Maybe we can squeeze in.
I'll sit on someone's lap.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.917
Shut up. Forget it, it's too small.
Why did you even get here?

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.038
- What are you trying to say?
- This trip was bad a idea.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.031
No... really?

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.239
- It could be worse.
- It could be worse?

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.710
How many fingers am I holding up?
They're fucking eating us!

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.429
- How can it get any worse?
- Can everyone shut the fuck up?

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.833
Cracking skulls open with a 9-iron
is not my idea of golfing holiday!

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.629
But this is not Mikey's fault,
and it's not Banksy's.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.360
I'm sure as fucking shit,
it's not mine either.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.351
Relax... Relax...

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:28.360
Now, we all need to work together
to facilitate some kind of positive -

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.593
and I mean POSITIVE escape scenario,
'cause I'm not dying in this shit hole!

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.393
<i>There's nothing wrong with you
that can't be fixed with a smile.</i>

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.671
Get on the bus.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.918
Come on!

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.917
Ruth!

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.712
Banksy!

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.757
Banksy!

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.478
Banksy!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.318
Come on! I've had enough
of standing here!

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.472
I'll fuckin stick it in ya!
I'll fucking stick it in ya!

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.596
Get in the fucking bus!

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.274
I'm fucking sick of it! Fuck!

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.356
Come on, Vince, let's go!
Let's go!

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.715
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.830
What, now? Can't it wait?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.353
No.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.875
Well, it's about fucking time.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.875
Anyone seen me lighter?

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.156
Where's me lighter?

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.752
Oi, look after it next time, yeah?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.758
You know, I always thought you two
were completely fucking useless.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.310
You - you just follow your dick
like it's a fucking compass.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.359
And you - you're letting your marriage
slip through your fucking fingers.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.829
Neither of you
know anything about women.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.039
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.998
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:54.036
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.589
We try to be what they want us to be.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:03.108
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.356
And then what happens?

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.512
They get bored -
that's what happens.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.790
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.833
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.753
and roll over, and play dead.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.238
From now on,
what you see is what you get.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.472
For fuck's sake!

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.279
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.433
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.070
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.233
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.790
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.236
Whoa, easy, easy!

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.232
Oh, my God!

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.437
What was that?

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.556
Fat bird.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.030
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.756
Hello, hello...

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.951
Hello? Is anybody there?

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.317
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.552
In the nest with the stiffs.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.711
Where are you?

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.077
Coming to get you, silly twat.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.077
Let's do it.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.236
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.798
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.077
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:00.268
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.953
Yeah.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.074
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.356
Pass one of them golf clubs.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.353
No, give me a wood.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.511
Give him wood as well.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.190
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.476
But I've got the hump.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.633
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.872
and... present company
excepted, of course,

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.158
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.356
Bloody hell, Vince...

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.916
not very PC is it?

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.749
Come on.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.872
Let's have it!

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.192
Now what?

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.235
Oi, oi!

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.236
You all right?

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.031
I've got it working.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.077
Let me see that, let me see that.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.677
Remote-controlled women.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.798
- Do it again, Neil!
- My word!

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.199
Take that.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.639
Get in there, Graham.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.751
Be careful, Neil.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.078
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.232
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.277
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:06.433
Bollocks!

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.559
Go!
