WEBVTT

00:00.404 --> 00:01.814
Where's my wife?
Where the hell is she?

00:02.239 --> 00:03.519
You cannot stop me from seeing her!

00:04.032 --> 00:05.112
Winona! Winona, are you...

00:05.242 --> 00:08.029
I'm assuming you don't recognise
either of them.

00:09.788 --> 00:10.784
Raylan?

00:10.914 --> 00:14.248
I said, "I'm assuming you don't
recognise either of them."

00:14.459 --> 00:15.539
No.

00:16.003 --> 00:17.580
I mean, yes. I don't.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.916
I hope you don't feel like
we're distracting you here, Deputy.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.379
Tell me your name again.

00:22.551 --> 00:23.926
I told you my name is Ives.

00:24.052 --> 00:26.378
Sergeant Ives is from Army CID.

00:26.763 --> 00:28.637
It turns out after they left the Army,
both these guys...

00:28.765 --> 00:31.138
Hey, there's no need to go into all that.
Let's go.

00:31.351 --> 00:34.767
Anyway, we're looking for anywhere they
might have come across your path directly,

00:34.896 --> 00:37.684
but we figure they were hired by
somebody with a grudge against you.

00:37.858 --> 00:39.518
- Yeah.
- Seems like a long list.

00:39.735 --> 00:40.814
Yeah, that's hard to believe.

00:41.653 --> 00:44.109
Will you gentlemen just excuse me
for one minute?

00:44.573 --> 00:45.771
It's gonna be...

00:45.908 --> 00:48.030
Oh, well, if it isn't the man of the hour.

00:48.201 --> 00:49.446
- Gary.
- What's the matter, Raylan?

00:49.578 --> 00:51.736
You think it might make you feel better
to beat me into the floor?

00:51.872 --> 00:52.868
I think it might be worth a shot.

00:52.998 --> 00:54.373
All right, why don't you two
cut the shit right now?

00:54.499 --> 00:55.744
Oh, yeah. Another county heard from.

00:55.876 --> 00:57.536
I thought this would be, like,
your dream come true,

00:57.669 --> 00:59.876
seeing the two of us squaring off
to fight for your honour.

01:00.005 --> 01:01.168
I'd just like to talk to him.

01:01.340 --> 01:03.961
She is still my wife.
I can protect her, all right?

01:04.092 --> 01:05.670
The first step is to keep her
the hell away from you!

01:05.802 --> 01:08.175
Will you stop talking about me
like I'm not in the room, okay?

01:08.305 --> 01:09.764
Seriously, how much is enough?

01:09.973 --> 01:12.345
I mean, are you gonna have to actually
take a bullet for this guy?

01:12.476 --> 01:13.721
Oh, come on, Gary. That's not fair.

01:13.977 --> 01:14.973
Fair? What isn't fair?

01:15.103 --> 01:18.270
Is it fair because he lives a life where
people are trying to kill him all the time

01:18.398 --> 01:20.640
that you get caught up in the crossfire?
Come on! Hey, hey!

01:20.776 --> 01:23.314
Mr. Hawkins, I'm gonna need you
to get out of this office.

01:24.821 --> 01:26.019
I'm staying with my wife.

01:27.532 --> 01:29.359
Winona, you've given your statement,
haven't you?

01:29.493 --> 01:30.488
Yeah.

01:30.619 --> 01:32.446
If it's all right, I'm gonna
send Rachel home with you

01:32.579 --> 01:35.663
and have her stay there with you
until we can sort some of this out.

01:35.874 --> 01:37.701
Now, if you would like to go with her,

01:37.834 --> 01:41.417
that is something for the three of you
to discuss in the elevator.

01:45.634 --> 01:48.635
- Walk. Walk.
- He's upset.

01:48.971 --> 01:52.055
He's an asshole. But he's not wrong.

01:52.766 --> 01:55.886
It would be crazy for you to be
anywhere near me right now, okay?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.769
You go with Rachel.
She'll take care of you.

02:01.858 --> 02:03.056
- Winona.
- Thank you.

02:04.653 --> 02:07.025
Are we done with playtime now?

02:09.991 --> 02:14.653
Oh. My car got pretty banged up,
so I was thinking I'd just...

02:14.788 --> 02:17.077
It's a good thing you're gonna be
staying put for a while, then.

02:17.207 --> 02:18.322
Why would I be doing that?

02:18.709 --> 02:20.203
Not up for discussion, Raylan.

02:20.335 --> 02:23.122
You can either accept protection
or you can quit the Marshals Service.

02:23.255 --> 02:24.630
I'm not gonna tell you which I'd rather.

02:24.756 --> 02:26.132
Art, I don't see how any of this has...

02:26.258 --> 02:29.342
I'm gonna have Tim shadow you
so that you can't do any more damage.

02:29.553 --> 02:31.711
Oh, so he's not my bodyguard,
he's my nanny?

02:32.013 --> 02:33.212
You can call it that if you like,

02:33.473 --> 02:37.222
but he's gonna stay with you until I can
figure out exactly what happened tonight.

02:37.477 --> 02:39.885
What do you mean...
I told you what happened.

02:40.772 --> 02:41.887
Yeah, you did.

02:42.691 --> 02:44.185
Tim, you're with Raylan.

02:44.901 --> 02:46.146
Yes, sir. Keep him safe and sound.

02:46.278 --> 02:50.572
Unless you see him attempting
to participate in this investigation,

02:50.699 --> 02:52.857
in which case
you have my permission to shoot him.

03:02.210 --> 03:05.247
Rachel, the guest room
is just at the top of the stairs.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.417
Thank you, but I'm not here to sleep.
I need to take a look around.

03:08.592 --> 03:09.872
Oh, yeah.

03:12.471 --> 03:13.466
So...

03:13.597 --> 03:17.179
Well, I'll sleep on the couch in my
office, and you can take our room...

03:17.309 --> 03:19.182
- I mean, our old room.
- It's all right. Thank you.

03:21.897 --> 03:26.191
Just so you know,
I don't think this is anything it isn't,

03:27.569 --> 03:29.609
but it's wonderful to have you home.

03:35.786 --> 03:37.944
You know, your rear bumper's
hanging by a thread.

03:38.205 --> 03:40.281
Every time we hit a bump,
I thought it was gonna come off,

03:40.415 --> 03:44.199
- smash straight through my windshield.
- Yet you still stayed so close.

03:45.253 --> 03:48.040
I don't suppose you got one of
them suites with a pull-out couch.

03:50.717 --> 03:54.133
You got any buddies became
contractors when they got out?

03:54.262 --> 03:56.089
- Why?
- The hitters from last night.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.220
- Is that why that CID guy showed up?
- I think so.

03:59.351 --> 04:01.593
Yeah, Art says I'm not supposed to
talk to you about that.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.431
Contractors?

04:03.563 --> 04:05.105
Yeah. Most of those guys are okay.

04:05.273 --> 04:09.437
Some of them, though, they get home, find
out they can't hack it back in the world

04:09.569 --> 04:11.526
without the mad minute,
and start hiring out for wet work.

04:12.572 --> 04:14.316
I'll call the front desk,
see if I can get you a cot.

04:14.491 --> 04:16.067
I got a sleeping bag in the trunk.

04:19.370 --> 04:23.155
You're not gonna try to go out the
window or anything while I'm gone?

04:23.333 --> 04:25.575
No. Not right now. I'm beat.

04:25.919 --> 04:27.034
Plus, you got your car here.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.412
Even if I got a jump on you,
you'd be right behind me.

04:29.589 --> 04:31.961
- But you will eventually.
- Eventually, yes.

04:32.175 --> 04:33.586
Yes. Why would you do that?

04:33.844 --> 04:35.966
Well, I gotta talk to
some people, alone.

04:36.596 --> 04:40.511
So, either you let me go,
or I'm gonna have to give you the slip.

04:41.393 --> 04:43.266
I love this shit.
This shit makes me hard.

04:44.062 --> 04:45.936
Well, then we've both been warned.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.592
There's one thing I need
you to promise me.

05:27.188 --> 05:28.599
What's that?

05:29.608 --> 05:31.018
No whores.

05:31.526 --> 05:34.860
Oh, Ava, I ain't been to a whore
since I was 14 years old.

05:36.531 --> 05:38.690
I'm not talking about going to whores,

05:39.451 --> 05:42.238
although now that you mention it,
you better not do that, either.

05:43.622 --> 05:46.029
I'm talking about running them.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.917
Oh, well, now, hold on a second.
I mean, the economy what it is,

05:49.044 --> 05:51.582
now is not the time
to cut off potential revenue streams.

05:51.838 --> 05:54.412
Besides, as many people around here
as we got out of work.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.422
You really wanna deny
enterprising young women

05:57.552 --> 05:59.877
an opportunity for
gainful employment?

06:00.055 --> 06:01.549
- I'm serious.
- Well, so am I.

06:01.932 --> 06:04.469
The president can't stop talking
about economic stimulus,

06:04.726 --> 06:07.395
and here you are wanting to take away
some of that very stimulation.

06:07.646 --> 06:09.852
You gonna promise me or not?

06:11.608 --> 06:12.983
All right. I promise.

06:36.299 --> 06:37.959
Oh, my God.

06:41.596 --> 06:43.055
Did you sit in that chair all night?

06:43.306 --> 06:45.928
Ever since Ranger School,
I can't sleep past 6:30.

06:46.142 --> 06:49.096
Well, listen, I gotta make a phone call
that I'm not supposed to make,

06:49.813 --> 06:51.556
that if you overheard
you should report,

06:51.690 --> 06:54.690
so do you wanna go outside
and check the perimeter,

06:55.110 --> 06:57.149
or do I have to pretend
to take a shower?

07:10.625 --> 07:11.704
Was it Gio?

07:12.585 --> 07:14.163
I was hoping you could tell me.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.997
Well, the way I hear it,
Gio's only hiring Cubans these days.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.960
Even if he wants to cover his tracks?

07:21.344 --> 07:24.262
Yeah, apparently Bo Crowder
took away his taste for gringos.

07:24.389 --> 07:25.848
Doesn't trust them any more.

07:26.016 --> 07:28.341
<i>- That ain't very progressive, now, is it?</i>
- Yeah.

07:28.768 --> 07:30.144
Be nice to know for sure.

07:30.353 --> 07:33.556
Well, I could always go ask him,
although if he cops to it,

07:33.690 --> 07:37.390
I guess I have to shoot him. Don't want
him to think I'm not a man of my word.

07:37.861 --> 07:39.688
- No.
<i>- My opinion?</i>

07:40.405 --> 07:41.401
<i>Sounds closer to home.</i>

07:42.032 --> 07:43.027
What do your C.I. S say?

07:43.158 --> 07:45.731
Art told me to steer clear
of the investigation.

07:45.869 --> 07:46.864
Let me get this straight.

07:46.995 --> 07:49.367
When Art gives you orders,
you actually follow them?

07:49.789 --> 07:51.616
Or are you just saying that
to hurt my feelings?

07:52.542 --> 07:55.958
Seriously, Ray, have you pissed off
any shit-kickers lately?

08:05.805 --> 08:07.181
We clear?

08:08.767 --> 08:11.008
Well, Baz,
looks like you got at least one

08:11.144 --> 08:13.350
close enough to let a guy know
you're shooting at him.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.768
Maybe it'll scare him enough,
he'll have a heart attack.

08:16.274 --> 08:17.685
There's something
wrong with my action.

08:17.942 --> 08:20.315
Bullshit. I checked it myself.

08:20.445 --> 08:22.687
How's a guy who spent his whole life
in Harlan County

08:22.864 --> 08:24.062
never learned to shoot
better than that?

08:24.199 --> 08:25.313
Hey, hey, listen up. Listen up.

08:25.450 --> 08:29.911
A guy his size don't need to shoot, just
like he don't need to fight, all right?

08:30.038 --> 08:35.458
I mean, Coover, he loved to wave that
pistol around all over the place.

08:35.585 --> 08:39.035
But the truth is, he couldn't hit
water if he fell out of a boat.

08:39.255 --> 08:42.789
Yeah, but I would love to hear somebody say
that Coover couldn't fight.

08:42.926 --> 08:46.710
Yeah, Coover, he could fight.
He could fight.

08:47.347 --> 08:50.348
But he didn't have to. That's the thing.
That's what I'm saying. Right, Baz?

08:50.475 --> 08:52.053
- Yes, sir.
- Just like Baz.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.637
Yes, sir. Listen, man,

08:55.605 --> 08:59.555
your marksmanship is just gonna take
a little while to catch up to your fists.

08:59.692 --> 09:05.398
Until then, all you have to do is just
put that bad boy inside your coat,

09:05.865 --> 09:09.910
square off with some cowboy,
point it in his general direction,

09:10.036 --> 09:13.322
he comes within 20 feet or so,
you cut him right in half.

09:13.456 --> 09:14.998
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Easy.

09:15.416 --> 09:18.832
Maybe just one little rule.
When you do shoot that thing,

09:19.337 --> 09:22.540
please make sure as shit
that I am behind you.

09:24.717 --> 09:26.757
- All right, man.
- All right. Here we go.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.544
And one... And two...

09:37.272 --> 09:39.763
I hope you don't think you're going
anywhere without your bodyguard.

09:40.441 --> 09:41.770
I was just gonna pick
up some ice cream.

09:42.026 --> 09:43.224
Ice cream for breakfast?

09:43.444 --> 09:45.152
Yeah. It's got eggs, milk.

09:45.697 --> 09:48.022
You know an ice cream
shop open this early?

09:48.575 --> 09:50.982
No, but there's a store down the road
that carries some.

09:51.411 --> 09:53.487
Well, I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

09:53.705 --> 09:55.947
- I ain't asking for your help.
- It's from the movie.

09:56.082 --> 09:58.324
She asks Costner to
hand her her jacket.

09:59.377 --> 10:03.161
Well, you start singing that song,
I'm gonna make a run for it right now.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.421
Well, I do the Dolly Parton version.

10:08.511 --> 10:10.504
Some of it's his mom's, which,
you know...

10:11.181 --> 10:12.841
But we have to keep it in here
just to keep her...

10:13.016 --> 10:14.011
Rachel.

10:16.853 --> 10:21.147
It's awful nice getting to see your face
in the morning, no matter the reason.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.020
- I just need to...
- Yeah.

10:31.075 --> 10:32.320
Winona, I just...

10:37.415 --> 10:40.369
I want you to know
that I'm sorry for everything.

10:40.502 --> 10:43.039
Oh, you mean, like, the horse
and all the insurance stuff

10:43.171 --> 10:45.377
and acting like a prick
at the settlement conference and...

10:45.507 --> 10:46.751
Yes, all of it.

10:47.592 --> 10:51.590
I mean, sometimes I'll do something, and
it feels like it's not even me doing it.

10:52.013 --> 10:55.512
You know, like I'm watching myself
from the outside,

10:56.100 --> 10:59.185
and I'm saying, "Well, who is this guy?
What is he thinking?"

11:01.064 --> 11:02.059
I guess that sounds crazy.

11:02.190 --> 11:05.107
No, not as crazy as it might have
sounded a couple weeks ago.

11:05.443 --> 11:08.361
I made some terrible choices lately,
and I don't know why.

11:09.072 --> 11:12.939
Well, I can't throw stones
on that score, so...

11:16.704 --> 11:18.080
Do you want some coffee?

11:18.790 --> 11:21.625
Tell me again why we passed
the first two places on the way here?

11:22.293 --> 11:24.665
The first place keeps
its icebox too cold.

11:24.921 --> 11:27.673
- All right. And the supermarket after that?
- The supermarket's too big.

11:27.882 --> 11:30.800
The delivery man must let the ice
cream sit there 10, 15 minutes

11:30.927 --> 11:33.679
while he loads the pallets.
Leads to freezer burn.

11:33.930 --> 11:35.472
Plus, these guys carry Chaney's.

11:35.932 --> 11:38.423
- Sure you don't want some?
- A little early in the day for me.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.303
Well, it's 5:00 p.m. Somewhere.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.394
What's this?

11:46.776 --> 11:48.318
I was just gonna...

11:51.489 --> 11:54.158
Do I look like the "climb out
the bathroom window" type?

11:54.784 --> 11:57.109
All right. Go to your bathroom.

12:01.833 --> 12:03.208
- Is that it?
- Yep.

12:11.801 --> 12:13.426
You don't have a restroom, do you?

12:17.640 --> 12:20.392
You know, it's the eighth
bullet I've taken.

12:20.518 --> 12:27.137
The first three were at one sitting, when
sappers tried to overrun us at Nha Trang.

12:29.444 --> 12:33.026
The last one before this
was from my own son.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.241
That's something you and I
have got in common.

12:37.827 --> 12:40.365
We've both taken a bullet
from Raylan Givens.

12:41.956 --> 12:44.791
But there's something
else we both have,

12:46.169 --> 12:49.454
and that's a talent for
playing the angles.

12:50.381 --> 12:54.082
Way you worked that coal lady,
well, my hat's off to you.

12:54.385 --> 12:56.259
That's very kind of you to say,
Mr. Givens.

12:56.596 --> 12:57.876
Call me Arlo.

12:58.306 --> 13:03.762
Well, Arlo, the reason why we're here
is there's parts of my daddy's business

13:03.895 --> 13:06.350
that even Johnny here wasn't privy to,

13:06.689 --> 13:11.565
things that Bo might have given up
before we come of age.

13:11.736 --> 13:15.021
The way I understand it, Arlo,
is, back in the day,

13:15.531 --> 13:17.820
when this place was
really the Wild West,

13:17.950 --> 13:20.655
the only way anyone would come in
here from out of town to do a deal,

13:20.787 --> 13:23.538
say, pick up a big pot harvest,

13:24.123 --> 13:27.539
was if you and Uncle Bo
would ride in and out with them.

13:27.835 --> 13:30.161
Figured no one would be dumb enough
to hijack a load if it meant

13:30.296 --> 13:32.123
their whole family would have
to spend the rest of their lives

13:32.256 --> 13:33.252
looking over their shoulders.

13:33.383 --> 13:36.218
Now, had my daddy
been a more calculating man,

13:36.677 --> 13:38.919
when those arrangements
were no longer necessary,

13:39.055 --> 13:41.297
he might have used his knowledge
of where and how those loads

13:41.432 --> 13:47.934
were packaged and transferred, to
get in the hijacking business himself.

13:51.734 --> 13:54.569
I mention Raylan took
off my ankle tether?

13:56.155 --> 13:58.729
It means I'm free to
come and go as I please.

13:58.908 --> 14:00.651
Well, how about that leg, Arlo?

14:00.868 --> 14:03.359
Is it free to come and go as it pleases?

14:20.096 --> 14:21.638
Are they still at it?

14:22.223 --> 14:23.421
Looks that way.

14:24.475 --> 14:27.180
I think I'm gonna cut 'em out.
Maybe quit drinking, too.

14:27.437 --> 14:29.180
Live life clean for a while.

14:30.022 --> 14:31.018
I got it.

14:35.153 --> 14:36.695
Thank you.

14:37.447 --> 14:39.819
Any idea what they're all cooking up
in there?

14:39.949 --> 14:43.069
Give me. Not a clue.

14:43.202 --> 14:44.910
Oh, that's good.

14:45.955 --> 14:49.122
There have been lots of times I wished
I knew less about what he does.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.536
I can't ever remember a time
I wished I knew more.

14:53.004 --> 14:56.704
Miss Helen, are you giving me
motherly counsel?

14:57.425 --> 15:01.719
Well, just remember, honey, no matter
what anyone does to you,

15:01.846 --> 15:04.337
how much they scare you,
how much they hurt you,

15:04.557 --> 15:07.130
you can't tell what you don't know.

15:15.443 --> 15:17.649
Boys. Mags.

15:18.362 --> 15:19.987
Looks like you're
getting ready for a war.

15:20.656 --> 15:22.067
Is that all you got to say to me?

15:22.658 --> 15:24.698
You wanna tell me
what's happening here?

15:26.078 --> 15:31.239
Some of the people haven't taken too kindly
to the deal I made with that coal lady.

15:32.627 --> 15:38.499
Bad enough they painted the walls,
broke out the windows,

15:38.925 --> 15:41.760
took everything they could carry
off the shelves.

15:42.178 --> 15:46.639
One of them relieved himself on the floor.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.178
Now, that ain't gonna happen twice.

15:49.477 --> 15:51.884
Someone took a run at me last night.

15:52.021 --> 15:54.014
Almost got my ex-wife
for good measure.

15:54.232 --> 15:55.607
You think it was me
who give the order?

15:55.983 --> 15:57.146
It crossed my mind.

15:57.276 --> 15:59.946
- You did kill my baby.
- Yeah.

16:00.112 --> 16:02.650
But I was the one
that let him become a nitwit.

16:02.865 --> 16:05.154
Now, I'm not taking the blame,
mind you.

16:05.493 --> 16:08.778
Coover had plenty of time
to straighten himself out.

16:08.996 --> 16:11.570
And you did save Loretta,

16:12.291 --> 16:15.458
saved me from living out my days
with her blood on me.

16:15.628 --> 16:18.119
I'm not sure it makes us exactly even,

16:18.673 --> 16:23.002
but I made a deal with your Aunt Helen to
keep the lid on, and I intend to honour it.

16:23.135 --> 16:25.175
And what about the rest of the family?
They agree to that?

16:28.849 --> 16:33.310
- How's Loretta?
- Well, she seems fine, considering.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.981
Make sure she knows I didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.359
Any of it.

16:40.403 --> 16:42.230
- Did you bring me my change?
- Nope.

16:42.655 --> 16:44.233
Ice cream's melted, too.

16:44.365 --> 16:45.943
You found me. I'm impressed.

16:46.117 --> 16:47.825
Yeah, give me a little credit.
I'm a professional.

16:47.952 --> 16:49.067
Okay.

16:49.287 --> 16:51.493
- Is she behind it?
- She says no.

16:52.373 --> 16:54.366
What's with the Oak Ridge Boys
out front of her place?

16:54.500 --> 16:57.252
Well, it's all about that Black Pike deal.

16:58.170 --> 16:59.878
So you're done here?

17:00.423 --> 17:05.665
Yeah. Oh, and just so you're not confused,
I'm now gonna go to Winona's,

17:05.803 --> 17:08.211
check in on her, unless, of course,
that's against the rules.

17:08.347 --> 17:11.513
The only rule is you don't ditch me
in the middle of a damn convenience store.

17:11.642 --> 17:14.643
And I'm not telling Art, by the way,
'cause that'd be my ass, too.

17:14.854 --> 17:18.852
So, yeah, let's go see your ex-wife,
girlfriend, whatever it is we're calling her.

17:30.953 --> 17:32.613
Well, look at that, Doyle.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.321
- I never have to look for you.
- Are you looking for me?

17:36.459 --> 17:39.246
'Cause I got a call saying you were
here harassing a grieving old woman.

17:40.254 --> 17:44.750
Oh. Well, someone hired a couple pros
to clip me last night.

17:45.009 --> 17:47.761
- I guess they hired the wrong pros, huh?
- I guess.

17:48.596 --> 17:52.261
- You think Mama sent 'em?
- Not necessarily. It could have been you.

17:52.558 --> 17:55.227
If the police chief wants to kill a guy,
he ain't gotta send anyone.

17:55.686 --> 17:58.640
He just waits for the guy
to show up on his turf,

17:58.773 --> 18:01.727
and he rolls up on him
with a bunch of his police officers.

18:01.901 --> 18:05.899
You know, that way, he can make it
look like the guy died resisting arrest.

18:06.030 --> 18:08.402
Or if that don't fly,
well, hell, he could just

18:09.367 --> 18:12.154
disappear the body down an old,
boarded-up mine shaft.

18:12.536 --> 18:13.616
Doyle.

18:14.914 --> 18:15.910
Doyle!

18:17.583 --> 18:21.332
Deputy Givens come here to ask a
question. Now he's got his answer,

18:21.462 --> 18:23.953
he and his friend are
gonna head back home.

18:26.092 --> 18:28.499
Everything I said holds.

18:32.682 --> 18:33.677
All right.

18:35.434 --> 18:37.142
I mean, you think I sent them hitters,

18:37.478 --> 18:39.471
you gotta figure, when you get
down here, there's a chance

18:39.605 --> 18:41.432
I might wanna O.K. Corral it.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.358
You bring one man to back you up?

18:44.568 --> 18:47.106
Yeah, well, I thought
you'd bring more guys.

18:49.407 --> 18:52.906
I hope you'll take this
in the spirit it's intended.

18:53.703 --> 18:55.991
I made a lot of money with your daddy,

18:56.372 --> 19:00.370
but that man didn't know a damn thing
about growing weed.

19:00.501 --> 19:02.209
Well, that was a different time.

19:02.628 --> 19:05.380
Well, the point is, Coover was a genius.

19:05.756 --> 19:08.841
I mean, I'd put his shit
on my Mount Rushmore.

19:09.176 --> 19:12.296
That Hindu Kush can kiss my ass.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.222
Nice of you to say.

19:14.432 --> 19:16.923
It's true. He was a genius.

19:18.227 --> 19:22.141
And I gotta tell you, when all this
happened, I didn't know what to expect.

19:23.107 --> 19:26.772
I come down here,
and I see you are on the bean.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.774
A-Ron, right here.

19:37.163 --> 19:40.614
I'm assuming you want 80 again,
like last time?

19:40.750 --> 19:41.912
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

19:42.168 --> 19:43.876
You okay using the Bennett scale?

19:48.758 --> 19:50.631
You have any idea who I am?

19:50.760 --> 19:55.338
Rodney "Hot Rod" Dunham
out of Memphis, Tennessee.

19:55.556 --> 19:56.552
You know what that means?

19:56.682 --> 19:58.556
Oh, it means I'm in the right place.

19:59.351 --> 20:02.471
I thought over your offer, Dick. I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to respectfully decline.

20:02.605 --> 20:03.850
You wanna hear my counter?

20:04.857 --> 20:08.190
Since you called off the deal
that I made with your mama,

20:08.319 --> 20:11.439
I'm gonna have to take all the weed business,
too, starting with this right here.

20:11.572 --> 20:12.687
You think I won't find you?

20:12.865 --> 20:14.858
Oh, no, sir.
I'm counting on you to find me.

20:14.992 --> 20:17.697
You just bought some of my best weed
to take to the good people of Memphis.

20:17.828 --> 20:19.572
Now, I hope you come back
for a whole lot more.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.702
Now, if you'll get your entourage here
to tote these bags out to the car,

20:23.876 --> 20:25.619
we'll get you packed up
and loaded on your way.

20:29.298 --> 20:30.709
Come on.

21:03.624 --> 21:05.118
Okay, we gotta hit back right away.

21:05.251 --> 21:07.706
That is the first priority,
only priority, right?

21:07.837 --> 21:10.588
I mean, the money and the reefer,
that is just, it's gravy.

21:11.006 --> 21:12.750
Gotta hit back right away. Why?

21:12.967 --> 21:14.165
Because we gotta stop people thinking,

21:14.301 --> 21:16.673
"Hey, we can just rip these guys off
and not pay a price."

21:16.971 --> 21:18.251
Do you understand? So listen up.

21:18.389 --> 21:23.051
Look, look, Dickie, man, I'm sorry, man.
I'm out.

21:28.148 --> 21:31.315
I'm sorry...
Did you say you're out? What...

21:31.485 --> 21:34.522
Listen, man, I joined up with y'all
'cause I needed to make a little cash.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.447
I ain't trying to go to no war.

21:36.991 --> 21:40.360
It's okay with you if
Boyd Crowder just...

21:42.788 --> 21:46.122
piss all over our reputation.
Piss all over our reputation.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.993
- You understand that?
- That's your reputation.

21:48.127 --> 21:49.502
- You...
- I'm out, too.

21:53.007 --> 21:56.839
This is what I get for
hiring muscleheads.

21:58.596 --> 22:02.889
You gonna wanna get out of my
way, Dickie, before you end up hurt.

22:03.642 --> 22:05.220
Are you sure about that?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.596
I am pretty damn sure about that.

22:09.148 --> 22:10.144
Okay.

22:12.401 --> 22:13.397
Be gone.

22:13.694 --> 22:15.936
Godspeed, gentlemen.

22:19.909 --> 22:22.482
Baz, just one more thing, man.

22:25.247 --> 22:26.492
Jesus! Wait!

22:31.545 --> 22:34.036
Yep. What about you, Jed?

22:34.423 --> 22:36.463
Are you gonna tell me
you want out, too?

22:36.717 --> 22:38.425
Hell, no.

22:40.471 --> 22:41.751
What do we do now?

22:44.808 --> 22:46.635
<i>The faster we get him out
of here, the safer.</i>

22:46.769 --> 22:50.387
<i>That's right. We'll outsmart him
every step. We'll outsmart him.</i>

22:50.856 --> 22:52.730
<i>We only got two, three
hours' head start.</i>

22:53.067 --> 22:55.059
Did you really expect
her just to admit it?

22:56.445 --> 22:57.773
I thought there was a chance.

22:57.905 --> 23:00.657
Well, just 'cause she didn't
doesn't mean you can be certain.

23:00.783 --> 23:01.814
No.

23:01.951 --> 23:06.031
You think it's possible that they
never find out who was behind it?

23:06.163 --> 23:07.741
If they don't try again.

23:08.582 --> 23:11.204
What about the FBI?
Do they have any suspects?

23:11.335 --> 23:13.458
Not that we know of.

23:15.756 --> 23:19.291
If y'all excuse me, I'm having trouble
keeping my eyes open.

23:19.426 --> 23:21.633
Yeah, it's been a hell of a couple days.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.346
Raylan?

23:25.015 --> 23:26.178
I owe you an apology.

23:26.725 --> 23:30.308
Last night, my behaviour,
I shouldn't have come at you like that.

23:30.437 --> 23:33.723
You didn't say anything
I wasn't saying to myself.

23:40.489 --> 23:42.316
If there is a silver lining to all this,

23:42.449 --> 23:46.032
it's that he has come back from that
crazy line he crossed over.

23:46.161 --> 23:49.826
He actually apologised to me about
all that bullshit at the lawyer's office

23:49.957 --> 23:52.958
and about the crazy insurance stuff.

23:53.752 --> 23:56.243
- But why is he here, exactly?
- This is his house.

23:56.505 --> 23:58.663
I know technically it's his house,
but can't we just...

23:58.799 --> 24:01.041
You know what? Maybe we
could talk about this in private?

24:01.385 --> 24:05.335
Okay. Yeah, in fact,
you guys don't need to be here, either.

24:05.472 --> 24:06.504
Excuse me?

24:06.640 --> 24:09.724
Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed
before I turn into a pumpkin.

24:09.893 --> 24:10.889
Would you care to join me?

24:11.145 --> 24:12.722
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

24:13.022 --> 24:14.682
I feel like I'm in <i>The Big Chill.</i>

24:14.857 --> 24:16.684
- Yeah, except no one's dead.
- Yet.

24:16.817 --> 24:18.062
And the music sucks.

24:18.235 --> 24:19.895
Well, then go home, get some sleep.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.606
Art wants somebody here.

24:21.739 --> 24:23.815
I'm here, me and my shadow.

24:23.949 --> 24:25.230
Yeah, we're here till you leave.

24:25.534 --> 24:26.530
What's that supposed to mean?

24:26.702 --> 24:29.074
- Do you not remember this morning?
- What happened this morning?

24:29.204 --> 24:30.699
I told you I was gonna do that.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.700
- And now you're telling me you won't?
- Exactly.

24:32.833 --> 24:33.829
Do what?

24:37.713 --> 24:38.709
Whatever.

24:38.922 --> 24:41.959
Listen, I take my orders from Art,
which means I'm gonna be here

24:42.092 --> 24:43.421
unless he says otherwise.

24:43.677 --> 24:45.670
I will, however,
take you up on that sleep.

24:46.055 --> 24:48.628
I'm assuming you two
can handle the night watch.

24:50.476 --> 24:54.390
I'm gonna go to sleep, too.
I'll relieve you in four hours.

25:05.616 --> 25:07.988
Well, I must say, with all
this money on the table,

25:08.535 --> 25:11.109
I'm surprised by the lack of a smile
on your face.

25:11.288 --> 25:13.411
I think Dickie might have made me.

25:14.958 --> 25:17.331
No chance, man.
The way you moved in there,

25:17.503 --> 25:20.622
he probably thought there was a
25-year-old hardcase under that mask.

25:22.966 --> 25:24.461
That field you're looking at, Ava,

25:25.511 --> 25:29.460
when we were kids, Boyd and me,
we'd be out there sunup till sundown

25:29.723 --> 25:33.222
playing with this old George Blanda
football that Bowman had.

25:34.353 --> 25:38.813
Bo and my daddy, they'd come out
and play with us from time to time,

25:39.650 --> 25:41.892
till Bowman got so big,
he started running them over.

25:42.027 --> 25:43.106
Hey, Johnny.

25:43.320 --> 25:47.152
I hope you understand if picturing
Bowman and your Uncle Bo here

25:47.282 --> 25:49.820
doesn't exactly make my heart sing.

25:52.621 --> 25:55.539
Johnny, finish counting
out these shares.

25:59.503 --> 26:00.666
Hey.

26:01.213 --> 26:04.130
Hey, hey, hey.
Johnny don't mean no harm.

26:05.467 --> 26:06.582
Okay?

26:07.428 --> 26:08.459
I know.

26:11.140 --> 26:13.595
I just got some bad
memories of this place.

26:13.892 --> 26:16.134
Well, we're not gonna
come up here again.

26:17.354 --> 26:19.927
Is that a fact? How long we staying?

26:20.149 --> 26:22.604
A day. Two, maybe.

26:22.860 --> 26:26.904
Is there any reason in particular
we're staying?

26:30.117 --> 26:32.869
I'm just laying low 'cause I
wanna see how Dickie responds.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.694
If you're so worried about him,
why did you take him on?

26:35.831 --> 26:37.491
No, I'm not worried about him.

26:38.750 --> 26:44.041
But how he responds will let me know
whether or not his mama's behind him.

26:44.298 --> 26:47.334
I don't want you to
keep anything from me.

26:52.973 --> 26:54.515
As you please.

26:59.813 --> 27:01.605
How are those shares
working out, Johnny?

27:30.052 --> 27:31.462
What are you doing? Huh?

27:32.221 --> 27:33.964
You don't piss on someone's lawn.

27:35.724 --> 27:39.223
Get in the passenger's seat.
Let the heater start drying your pants.

27:40.395 --> 27:42.020
You mind if I zip up first?

27:42.147 --> 27:43.392
I'd mind if you didn't.

27:49.446 --> 27:51.569
Put them through the wheel.
Cuff the other hand.

27:52.616 --> 27:57.029
Future reference, a guy sitting
for an hour in a running car

27:57.162 --> 27:59.036
is either on a stakeout
or getting his ashes hauled.

27:59.164 --> 28:01.999
Either way, I don't think
that's the figure you wanna cut.

28:03.126 --> 28:07.456
Now, look. I know it's
unseasonably cold at the moment.

28:07.673 --> 28:10.424
Wouldn't be fun sitting all night
in a car without the heat on,

28:10.550 --> 28:13.042
but this is the life we've chosen.

28:14.638 --> 28:16.844
Smart keeping a round in the chamber.

28:17.015 --> 28:19.423
I know some folks worry
about accidental discharge,

28:19.559 --> 28:23.059
but with safeties so well made
these days, I just can't see it.

28:24.564 --> 28:28.265
"Baxter-Hawley Construction.
Frankfort, Kentucky."

28:29.653 --> 28:30.816
Construction, huh?

28:31.405 --> 28:32.484
This ain't over.

28:34.783 --> 28:37.404
Now, I'm gonna need you
to sit tight for a second

28:37.536 --> 28:39.196
while I sort some things out.

28:39.746 --> 28:43.032
Hopefully, the good folks
at Baxter-Hawley Construction

28:43.166 --> 28:45.408
can get along without you for a while.

28:50.924 --> 28:54.673
Hey, Dan, it's Raylan. Do me a favour.

28:55.387 --> 28:58.258
Run the ownership records
for a construction company.

29:01.643 --> 29:02.888
- Gary.
- Hey.

29:03.020 --> 29:05.475
Listen to me very carefully.
I don't know why you did it.

29:05.605 --> 29:06.768
I don't care why.

29:06.898 --> 29:08.856
Right now, I just need you
to take me to see Duffy.

29:08.984 --> 29:10.099
I don't know what you're...

29:10.235 --> 29:12.062
Gary, I don't got time for this shit.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.272
Now, you are gonna
take me to see Duffy.

29:14.406 --> 29:17.158
The only question is what I'm
gonna have to do to you first.

29:18.910 --> 29:20.702
We're gonna do this the hard way.
Let's go.

29:20.829 --> 29:23.664
Let's see what the guy in the car does
when I toss you out the front door.

29:23.790 --> 29:25.201
What guy? What car?

29:25.334 --> 29:26.662
The white guy in the grey Taurus

29:26.793 --> 29:29.165
that's registered to a company
owned by Duffy's sister.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.123
Now, don't you worry about that.
He's not here for you.

29:31.256 --> 29:33.961
Okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Raylan.

29:36.762 --> 29:37.924
I tried to call it off.

29:38.138 --> 29:39.134
When?

29:40.849 --> 29:43.387
Do you have any idea what it's like
to think of her being with you?

29:43.518 --> 29:44.847
I think I know exactly what that's like.

29:44.978 --> 29:48.561
Every time I close my eyes,
I think about her moaning your name.

29:48.690 --> 29:50.101
When did you call it off, hmm?

29:50.901 --> 29:52.276
After they tried and missed?

29:53.945 --> 29:55.190
And how did that go?

29:56.823 --> 29:58.863
He said he wanted me to come by
so we could talk it over.

29:58.992 --> 30:02.575
Yeah, but you came here instead,
drafted off Winona's protection.

30:03.538 --> 30:04.819
What happens when we pull it?

30:06.375 --> 30:08.747
We're not gonna do this forever.
What happens then?

30:09.294 --> 30:13.588
The best chance you got is helping me
get to him before he gets to you.

30:20.555 --> 30:21.800
Hawkins.

30:25.394 --> 30:26.508
Gary,

30:27.479 --> 30:30.515
I thought you would have realised by now
what happens when you try to dodge me.

30:31.983 --> 30:33.727
Well, I'm glad you came to your senses.

30:33.902 --> 30:37.603
I want you to meet me on 75 South
at the big rest stop

30:38.240 --> 30:41.609
just past Highbridge Creek.
You know where that is?

30:42.661 --> 30:43.941
Okay.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.785
- He wants me to meet him...
- Highbridge Creek rest stop. I heard.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.328
- You hear where we're going?
- Yes, sir.

30:52.170 --> 30:55.871
Oh, and, see if you can find a place to stop
on the way to get some painter's plastic

30:56.007 --> 30:58.463
- and some garbage bags.
- Got it.

30:59.094 --> 31:04.088
You know, the more I think about this,
I don't think this is a good idea.

31:04.224 --> 31:05.849
I... You know, Duffy is crazy.

31:05.976 --> 31:07.518
I think you need to call for some back...

31:07.644 --> 31:10.100
- We ain't calling anybody.
- Why not?

31:10.230 --> 31:12.436
'Cause all they'll do
is try to arrest him.

31:25.036 --> 31:26.828
Back up. Hands where I can see 'em.

31:31.626 --> 31:32.824
Gary,

31:34.129 --> 31:37.794
I'm pretty confident this is not
what we discussed on the telephone.

31:39.134 --> 31:41.589
- Marshal.
- Mr. Duffy.

31:46.183 --> 31:48.508
Should I be putting my hands up
or something?

31:48.768 --> 31:50.311
The guys from last night...

31:50.437 --> 31:52.844
You get them from your colleagues
in the security community?

31:52.981 --> 31:57.145
Does it really matter?
Or I guess I could say, "What guys?"

31:57.360 --> 31:58.819
What did Gary promise you?

31:59.279 --> 32:00.773
Some part in the insurance money?

32:01.156 --> 32:02.152
You ask him?

32:02.282 --> 32:03.278
I'm asking you.

32:03.408 --> 32:06.409
I have the funny feeling anything I say
can and will be used against me,

32:06.536 --> 32:08.529
or maybe I've just seen too much
<i>Law & Order.</i>

32:08.747 --> 32:12.827
Nothing will be used against you.
We're gonna end this, right now.

32:13.376 --> 32:15.618
- That sounds ominous.
- Well, that depends.

32:15.754 --> 32:19.123
I figure you're good enough that no one can
link the hitters from last night to you.

32:19.257 --> 32:22.009
- Thank you.
- Except, of course, for Gary.

32:22.469 --> 32:24.461
He seems like a bit of a loose end.

32:24.930 --> 32:27.421
Gary could put you in for all day.

32:27.974 --> 32:29.303
Raylan, what are you doing? What...

32:29.434 --> 32:31.972
Gary doesn't realise you were gonna
kill him anyway.

32:32.479 --> 32:36.642
I mean, that's why you had the
button man outside his house, right?

32:37.067 --> 32:39.355
- Raylan, you can't seriously...
- Gary. Gary.

32:39.653 --> 32:44.445
They ain't gonna kill you right now,
not in front of a Deputy US Marshal.

32:46.117 --> 32:49.818
Your problem is that
I'm just about done here.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.118
I don't care where you go.

32:55.710 --> 32:57.869
I'd leave the country,
but that's entirely up to you,

32:58.421 --> 33:00.912
as long as we never see you again.

33:05.470 --> 33:07.344
I'd go, now.

33:13.562 --> 33:14.937
Do you wanna explain
what just happened,

33:15.063 --> 33:17.388
or should we all
just pretend that's completely normal?

33:17.524 --> 33:20.691
Believe me, I'd like nothing more
than to lean on him,

33:20.819 --> 33:24.651
use him to put you away,
let Winona see what he really is.

33:26.658 --> 33:27.737
But?

33:29.327 --> 33:32.494
But I think it'd just tear her apart.

33:34.374 --> 33:37.660
So, are we finished?

33:38.545 --> 33:42.128
As long as you understand that the
next time we have this conversation,

33:42.757 --> 33:44.300
there won't be a conversation.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.354
I wake up for my shift on guard duty

33:58.481 --> 34:01.186
and I come down here to find
I've got no one to relieve.

34:03.778 --> 34:05.570
- Winona?
- She's still asleep.

34:06.531 --> 34:07.906
Rachel, too.

34:08.408 --> 34:11.409
Gary's not in his room, but somehow,
I think that's not news to you.

34:14.039 --> 34:15.782
Did you kill him?

34:16.708 --> 34:17.739
No.

34:17.958 --> 34:18.955
You kill anybody?

34:19.252 --> 34:20.283
No.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.416
Well, I guess there's that.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.871
You find out who was behind the hit?

34:27.052 --> 34:29.128
How much you wanna know, hmm?

34:30.096 --> 34:31.888
Yeah, forget I asked.

35:03.964 --> 35:06.122
Damn it, Arlo!
You have any idea what time it is?

35:06.633 --> 35:08.672
You about scared the ever-loving shit
out of...

35:13.848 --> 35:16.137
Oh, hey,
did you know you're out of beer?

35:16.476 --> 35:18.054
We drink liquor in this house.

35:19.229 --> 35:22.514
Are you offering liquor in this house?

35:22.732 --> 35:24.689
No, I am not. In fact,

35:25.110 --> 35:27.351
I was just about to ask you to leave.

35:27.612 --> 35:32.440
Isn't that something? We were just about
to tell you that we need to talk to Arlo.

35:32.826 --> 35:33.905
He's not here.

35:34.035 --> 35:40.239
Because Arlo is off somewhere
with Boyd Crowder counting my money.

35:41.209 --> 35:42.703
I wouldn't know about that.

35:42.961 --> 35:45.915
I tell you what, that don't
really matter, 'cause Arlo knows.

35:46.506 --> 35:48.582
Then you best be gone
when he gets back.

35:49.092 --> 35:51.464
Otherwise, he's gonna make
what Raylan did to your knee

35:51.594 --> 35:53.801
feel like a hand job from an angel.

35:53.930 --> 35:57.631
If Arlo cares about you at all,
the only thing that he's gonna be doing

35:57.767 --> 36:03.722
when he gets back home, is figuring
out how to get me back what's mine.

36:04.941 --> 36:09.235
Now, why don't you just put down
the peashooter there and come on in?

36:09.362 --> 36:12.446
Come on. Come on, make me some eggs
or something. What do you say?

36:12.824 --> 36:17.949
After Arlo gives you back
whatever it is he took from you,

36:19.956 --> 36:21.237
what'll you do to him then?

36:21.833 --> 36:23.541
What do you think?

36:28.923 --> 36:29.919
Oh!
