WEBVTT

02:19.928 --> 02:24.004
Eternal and Almighty God...

02:25.137 --> 02:28.261
- You make the deaf hear.
- Hey!

02:28.262 --> 02:31.293
- You make the mute speak.
- Hat!

02:31.386 --> 02:34.510
You send your son to us

02:34.511 --> 02:38.588
to free us from Satan's power.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.803
Enabling mankind

02:41.804 --> 02:45.969
to part from darkness and enter the light.

02:45.970 --> 02:50.046
Bless this child.

02:52.220 --> 02:54.302
Deliver him from the original sin

02:54.303 --> 02:57.427
and let him shine through you.

02:57.428 --> 03:01.504
May the Holy Spirit be with him.

03:02.637 --> 03:04.627
Yann

03:04.824 --> 03:09.837
I baptise you, in the name of Father,

03:21.386 --> 03:23.377
Son...

03:26.595 --> 03:28.586
and the Holy Spirit.

03:37.324 --> 03:39.407
Do you see?

03:39.616 --> 03:42.115
When he's upset
his eyes are like your dog's.

03:43.261 --> 03:47.337
Father's water... it's too cold.

03:48.469 --> 03:51.594
Come. Don't disturb him.

03:51.595 --> 03:52.636
Wait.

03:53.678 --> 03:55.760
Wait.

03:55.761 --> 03:59.837
I have something for him.

04:13.469 --> 04:15.552
Nice, huh?

04:15.553 --> 04:17.635
357 Magnum.

04:17.636 --> 04:20.060
Customised by an arms dealer.

04:20.061 --> 04:22.843
Aim for the stomach and with the kick
you hit the head.

04:22.844 --> 04:24.835
You won't miss.

04:28.053 --> 04:32.218
I want to carve a skull on the butt.
What do you think?

04:32.219 --> 04:34.301
Put it away,

04:34.302 --> 04:36.385
this is the wrong place.

04:36.386 --> 04:38.468
Don't you think this is a little soon?

04:38.469 --> 04:41.594
Why?
A man without a gun is not a man?

04:41.595 --> 04:44.718
First religious rite, then rite of passage.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.801
The baptism of gun fire.

04:46.802 --> 04:50.879
Jerry, don't!

05:47.219 --> 05:48.899
Shit, do you see that?

06:44.093 --> 06:48.676
- Oh! You like her?
- No, no.

06:48.677 --> 06:51.801
You don't like her?
Do you or don't you?

06:51.802 --> 06:55.877
Y-y-yes, I like her...

06:58.051 --> 07:00.042
Isn't she pretty, huh?

07:01.177 --> 07:05.343
Want to get in the truck with her?

07:05.344 --> 07:06.383
For five minutes.

07:06.384 --> 07:10.461
Just the two of you.
No?

07:11.593 --> 07:14.717
She gets aroused when she sees a uniform.

07:14.718 --> 07:17.841
Also, she's completely deaf.

07:17.842 --> 07:21.919
You can talk really dirty to her,
she can't hear it!

07:31.280 --> 07:33.468
That's disgusting!

07:33.780 --> 07:36.502
You wet your pants!
Shit-head.

07:39.697 --> 07:40.739
Bang!

07:44.363 --> 07:46.463
Man, change your clothes.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.814
It doesn't pay to wear a uniform these days.

07:57.426 --> 07:58.468
Out!

07:59.509 --> 08:00.979
Not out.

08:02.218 --> 08:04.197
- It's out!
- Out?

08:04.510 --> 08:06.410
How could you tell, it's a meter away?

08:06.801 --> 08:09.926
Pitbull scores, now serves.

08:10.191 --> 08:12.379
"Pitbull scores, now serves".

08:12.530 --> 08:14.526
Listen to that crow up there!
Has been!

08:14.535 --> 08:18.134
Because he believes "Cantona" is a kind of pasta
he can appoint himself referee?

08:18.138 --> 08:20.334
Forget it, Mosquito, let's say it's a foul.

08:20.342 --> 08:21.916
I don't give a fuck!

09:21.800 --> 09:23.791
15 - Love

09:54.091 --> 09:55.862
There...
That's for your ball!

09:56.175 --> 10:00.251
I've got plenty more for
whoever wants to fuck with me.

10:11.279 --> 10:15.967
Fuck this! I can't stand anymore
working with that bunch of Nazis.

10:16.175 --> 10:18.050
Then go get some earplugs!

10:19.091 --> 10:22.008
These guys are taking a holiday.
They look cool.

10:22.217 --> 10:25.041
Cool?
You think this is cool?

10:25.042 --> 10:29.416
Did you not see them play tennis?
You still think that they're cool? Are you kidding?

10:29.508 --> 10:31.590
They are edgy. Trust me!

10:31.591 --> 10:34.416
See that little nasty lice-headed idiot...

10:34.417 --> 10:36.799
Well, he took out his gun, just like that...

10:36.800 --> 10:40.966
and -Bang!- blew the tennis ball away!

10:40.967 --> 10:43.048
The whole gang is being watched.

10:43.049 --> 10:45.999
He will meet up with them. Certain!
This time he won't escape!

10:46.102 --> 10:47.343
You've told me a hundred times,

10:47.345 --> 10:49.736
so I can picture it
just as if I dreamt it myself!

10:49.738 --> 10:50.779
OK, David.

10:50.782 --> 10:52.443
But it wasn't a dream. I was there!

10:52.445 --> 10:53.394
Good-bye Sir!

10:55.396 --> 10:58.824
Who's the one holding the dog?
Don't know, got here last night.

10:59.196 --> 11:00.550
What kind of dog is that?

11:01.175 --> 11:02.217
Pitbull.

11:02.633 --> 11:04.925
No, this isn't a Pitbull.

11:05.238 --> 11:08.882
I mean the guy:
Jacky Sueur, also known as "Pitbull".

11:08.883 --> 11:12.216
An expert in brass knuckles
and luxury shop robberies.

11:13.258 --> 11:14.311
With an axe.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.913
With an axe?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.462
They seem to be regrouping.

11:18.466 --> 11:19.612
Looks like it.

11:20.341 --> 11:22.424
This one is Mosquito?

11:22.425 --> 11:24.507
No, that's Pitbull, I told you.

11:24.508 --> 11:26.590
This one is Mosquito, the edgy sniffer.

11:26.591 --> 11:28.541
- So that's the priest, right?
- Yeah...

11:28.675 --> 11:32.633
Let me tell you one thing, watch out
for Mosquito, he's trigger happy.

11:32.736 --> 11:35.132
Do you ladies still jerk off on shop-lifters?

11:35.861 --> 11:39.418
Not everyone gets to torture
fifteen-year-old pushers.

11:45.341 --> 11:48.687
Strange, my hands smell like meat.

12:01.279 --> 12:02.840
This is the famous Dobermann?

12:02.841 --> 12:04.833
He is the famous Dobermann.

12:11.174 --> 12:12.737
He looks like a junkie.

12:14.299 --> 12:15.966
They all do.

12:16.383 --> 12:18.674
Getting high, shooting around.

12:18.778 --> 12:20.549
It's the trend.

12:20.742 --> 12:21.888
"It's the trend!"

12:22.112 --> 12:24.715
Once I start, these clowns are dead meat.

12:24.716 --> 12:26.798
Of course.

12:26.799 --> 12:29.923
But you won't start.

12:29.924 --> 12:33.048
Christini, you're out.

12:33.049 --> 12:37.215
There are so many complaints against you,
they pile them to hold the ceiling!

12:37.216 --> 12:41.290
Go back playing Gestapo in your closet
and let us do our job. OK?

12:43.465 --> 12:44.414
Yes, commissioner.

13:16.174 --> 13:18.257
Shouldn't he call?

13:18.882 --> 13:20.965
That's not his style.

13:23.049 --> 13:24.932
Do we have an answering machine?

13:24.936 --> 13:27.415
In case he calls
while we're playing stupid games.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.297
That makes sense.

13:29.298 --> 13:32.644
As he never calls,
we won't have to wait for nothing.

13:34.507 --> 13:37.631
Why are you painting?
We leave in 3 days!

13:37.632 --> 13:41.797
What happened to this house?

13:41.798 --> 13:43.789
- You want to know?
- Of course!

13:47.007 --> 13:49.090
A golden boy,

13:50.132 --> 13:52.123
bankrupt...

13:53.256 --> 13:57.332
So he used a shotgun to solve his problems.

13:58.465 --> 14:00.456
His wife,

14:02.632 --> 14:04.623
3 children

14:07.840 --> 14:09.831
and himself.

14:10.965 --> 14:12.956
Fuck!

14:14.090 --> 14:17.755
All these traces make me freak out!

14:17.756 --> 14:19.919
It's all over the ceiling over my bed.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.677
I bet my room was the children's!

14:21.679 --> 14:23.121
A fucking pain in the arse!

14:23.123 --> 14:26.673
Instead, why don't they shoot the ones
who ruin their lives? Am I right?

14:26.675 --> 14:28.658
The lack of faith drives man mad.

14:28.674 --> 14:30.755
Lack of faith?

14:30.756 --> 14:33.459
Lack of money, you mean!

15:11.381 --> 15:13.894
You're dead, hombre!

15:16.590 --> 15:18.580
I know.

15:21.798 --> 15:23.880
- My sister...
- Wait.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.957
Let go my cock, it's my sister!

15:32.214 --> 15:35.339
Looks like you're back in business?

15:35.340 --> 15:36.809
I guess so.

15:39.507 --> 15:41.588
How about some coffee to wake up?

15:41.589 --> 15:44.193
I quit coffee. Kept me awake.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.797
There should be beer in the fridge.

15:46.798 --> 15:48.880
We're twins! Identical!

15:48.881 --> 15:52.957
We're identical twins. Perfect!

15:54.089 --> 15:55.871
There you go, just like that...

15:55.872 --> 15:58.355
I'll help you put the knife back.
Right, Sis? Huh?

15:58.356 --> 16:00.639
Isn't she gorgeous,
my lovely younger sister!

16:00.644 --> 16:02.237
Wow, wow, wow!

16:02.423 --> 16:06.496
Manu, stop messing around.
She's gonna cut your balls!

16:06.589 --> 16:09.830
She is my sister!
My sister!

16:10.756 --> 16:11.798
Precisely.

16:12.839 --> 16:16.089
Stop acting stupid! Shut the fuck up
and go compress the Corvette.

16:17.006 --> 16:21.081
Fuck's sake, Yann, why don't you drive
bin bags for a change?

16:22.214 --> 16:24.297
Dunno...
My legend, maybe.

16:24.298 --> 16:27.852
Legend...
I don't give a fuck about no legend.

16:28.881 --> 16:30.346
- Hey, Manu!
- What?

16:30.347 --> 16:31.689
- Don't sell it.
- No, no.

16:31.719 --> 16:34.428
- Mean it! Don't sell it!
- No!

16:35.443 --> 16:36.705
Come here.

16:37.839 --> 16:39.819
Did you think about me?

16:39.923 --> 16:42.004
I always do, champ.

16:42.005 --> 16:44.088
You want your car pressed?

16:44.089 --> 16:46.713
Press... You want me to press it.

16:46.814 --> 16:48.356
Have a look at the weapons?

16:48.401 --> 16:51.289
No, no. Don't unpack.
We take the lot.

17:02.318 --> 17:04.402
Too bad. That will leave marks.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.610
Planning a stick-up or what?

17:11.172 --> 17:14.727
More than that, Leo.
Much more.

17:18.463 --> 17:20.346
I need thirty "ghosts".

17:20.347 --> 17:22.730
Get Big Nose, Torpedo
and the Matthew Brothers.

17:22.735 --> 17:24.713
- All of them?
- Right.

17:24.714 --> 17:26.796
- There's a lot of them.
- Right.

17:26.797 --> 17:27.838
When?

17:27.839 --> 17:29.830
Tomorrow, go now.

17:35.547 --> 17:38.255
- Hello?
- Son of a bitch, asshole, jerk!

17:38.256 --> 17:39.938
- Oh, it's you.
- Are you coming?

17:39.939 --> 17:42.721
- Not this weekend. I can't. - Why?
- That's a "Three of a kind", see?

17:42.722 --> 17:44.184
Why? I just can't.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.646
You think I'm a fool?

17:45.647 --> 17:47.629
- I never said that!
- You're a pain...

17:47.630 --> 17:49.913
- I'm stuck here. I have things to do.
- Figures.

17:49.914 --> 17:51.796
Can't you understand?

17:51.797 --> 17:54.201
- They're your kids too, you know
- I know that!

17:54.209 --> 17:56.384
I'll get them the next two weekends.
Right?

17:56.387 --> 17:58.233
Royal Flush! I show it to you now but...

17:58.235 --> 17:59.917
...if you don't cheat a little you never get it!

17:59.920 --> 18:01.459
Next week and the one after. - Really?

18:01.461 --> 18:02.502
It's a deal.

18:02.504 --> 18:05.027
- Bye.
- Call me tomorrow.

18:05.338 --> 18:07.330
That woman's a drag.

18:13.672 --> 18:16.707
Must be a drunk who came
to the wrong house! I'll rectify.

18:22.006 --> 18:23.997
Calm down.

18:25.131 --> 18:27.214
Quit sniffing!

18:27.215 --> 18:29.296
It makes you edgy.

18:29.297 --> 18:31.288
Let me handle it.

18:32.422 --> 18:35.548
My outfit inspires confidence!

18:36.589 --> 18:37.631
Edgy?

18:38.673 --> 18:40.755
I'm not edgy, are you edgy?

18:40.756 --> 18:42.746
No.

19:07.005 --> 19:11.082
Priest, you came out in the open?

19:11.631 --> 19:14.380
What's that, heathen?
A halo?

19:20.839 --> 19:22.830
Nat the Gipsy.

19:25.339 --> 19:27.293
Hello princess.

19:27.631 --> 19:31.670
We were waiting for you.
If I may say, we were hoping for you.

19:37.006 --> 19:39.088
Thank you for shopping.

19:39.089 --> 19:41.079
Right, thanks.

19:43.255 --> 19:46.379
What did you rob?

19:46.380 --> 19:48.463
I don't rob,
I make an investment.

19:48.464 --> 19:51.588
It is so convenient to
cheat with sign language.

19:51.589 --> 19:52.630
Would you teach me?

19:52.631 --> 19:54.712
You rob and we wait.

19:54.713 --> 19:58.790
Thank you for the invitation.

20:00.964 --> 20:02.955
What?

20:05.130 --> 20:07.212
How long has he been like this?

20:07.213 --> 20:10.338
He's been fidgeting for weeks.

20:10.339 --> 20:15.457
He dreams of robbing banks.
The pillage...

20:15.547 --> 20:19.712
He thinks that policemen
have become an illusion.

20:19.713 --> 20:22.838
I am thinking with a new perspective,
slight difference!

20:22.839 --> 20:24.721
He forgets what age we live in.

20:24.722 --> 20:28.246
He doesn't care about technology:
double door system, security camera,

20:28.247 --> 20:31.171
double bottom cash boxes,
make him yawn!

20:31.172 --> 20:33.254
How about banks without tills?

20:33.255 --> 20:35.338
What about electronic cashiers?

20:35.339 --> 20:37.421
How will you rob these?

20:37.422 --> 20:39.413
You're just a fax machine.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.712
Yann, tell him about the world we live in.

20:44.713 --> 20:48.879
We can't help him no more.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.873
Not only are banks modernising.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.164
Sonia just gave me
a laser-guided machine gun.

21:00.338 --> 21:02.422
These are like small Maverick missiles.

21:03.464 --> 21:05.976
No double door can stop this.

21:08.671 --> 21:10.234
After breaking into the bank,

21:10.755 --> 21:13.355
the shock wave will have pinned
everyone to the wall.

21:18.046 --> 21:20.560
The shock wave of the rocket

21:25.785 --> 21:26.827
Wow!

21:27.422 --> 21:29.412
Beautiful.

21:30.546 --> 21:32.537
It's Christmas.

21:35.234 --> 21:37.331
Jingle bullets!

21:40.034 --> 21:41.496
Clodarec speaking.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.640
Commissioner,
there's news from the villa.

21:43.642 --> 21:46.711
A couple showed up earlier,
they all left together a minute ago.

21:46.713 --> 21:48.788
As soon as I get news
I'll fill you in later.

21:48.790 --> 21:50.632
Goddamn it... Goddamn it...

21:52.422 --> 21:53.461
Let's go!

21:53.462 --> 21:56.588
A couple showed up.
They all left the villa.

21:57.109 --> 22:01.795
It's them... It must be the Dobermann!
I can feel it, damn it!

22:01.796 --> 22:03.779
Who's tailing?
Cazenave and Tronchet...

22:03.780 --> 22:06.787
Plus Reiner on the bike.
We stuck a tracker under their car.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.887
It's pay day!
Let's keep it that way.

22:08.888 --> 22:11.988
Tell the mobile team to stand by
on the emergency frequencies.

22:11.992 --> 22:14.062
Wait! Wait, aren't you rushing it a bit?

22:14.064 --> 22:15.643
They might be going bowling.

22:15.645 --> 22:17.903
Are you in such a hurry
to look like an idiot?

22:17.905 --> 22:21.567
Taking three cars to the bowling alley?
No way!

22:21.588 --> 22:24.192
They're going to hit a bank.

22:24.713 --> 22:28.164
For sure, we have an appointment.

23:43.879 --> 23:46.529
You got your driving license
in a kinder egg, or what?

23:46.587 --> 23:47.733
What? What's wrong?

23:48.046 --> 23:50.036
- Hi, champ.
- Come here.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.295
If I go down, take care of Nat.

23:54.399 --> 23:57.212
She's gonna tell me to fuck off!
You know her!

23:57.222 --> 23:58.872
Don't let her be foolish! Got it?

23:59.504 --> 24:00.453
What's wrong?

24:01.587 --> 24:05.556
Ooh la la, so cute as a blonde...

24:05.566 --> 24:06.794
What?

24:06.795 --> 24:08.566
I mean you look good in a wig.

24:08.679 --> 24:10.661
If you scratch it, I'll slice you! OK?

24:10.662 --> 24:13.503
I'll put it in a parking space at the
hotel, then I get dressed to look like

24:13.506 --> 24:16.270
a good son then going home to my parents
this afternoon for my "Birthday"!

24:16.271 --> 24:17.416
So, don't worry.

24:20.337 --> 24:22.419
I'm never worried, OK?

24:22.420 --> 24:24.570
Go on, give a number where I can reach you.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.752
What do your parents think you do? Huh?

24:30.753 --> 24:34.830
Studying law.
They want to see me in the black gown.

24:37.004 --> 24:38.994
Goddamn faggot.

24:40.129 --> 24:41.378
I'd like to go with you.

24:41.382 --> 24:43.866
Oh yeah? And what are you gonna do
while we rob the bank?

24:43.870 --> 24:46.177
Blow the security guard? Huh?

24:46.178 --> 24:48.983
Why does she put on this kind of make-up
all of a sudden?

24:48.987 --> 24:52.091
Haven't you noticed that girls who get arrested
always look sloppy in the papers?

24:52.104 --> 24:53.040
So what?

24:53.045 --> 24:54.095
It's done on purpose!

24:55.753 --> 24:56.795
To set an example.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.079
For example, with that hair piece
they may say that you're a fag!

25:00.082 --> 25:01.124
Be careful!

25:02.004 --> 25:05.127
Are you nuts? Shit!

25:05.128 --> 25:07.211
Are you coming, baby?

25:08.253 --> 25:09.294
This is such a mess!

25:09.295 --> 25:11.377
OK, let's go.

25:11.378 --> 25:14.503
Your girl might be deaf
but sometimes I wonder...

25:14.504 --> 25:17.315
Mosquito, aren't you wearing a mask?

25:17.419 --> 25:20.919
Yep! I like to see my face in the newspapers.
Suits me better to be me!

25:21.795 --> 25:23.877
Who else is on the fake hits?

25:23.878 --> 25:27.002
Leo, Manu, Big Nose, Torpedo
and the Matthew Brothers.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.885
- All of them?
- Yeah.

25:28.886 --> 25:30.227
You got a bunch of clowns!

25:30.228 --> 25:31.778
I doubt everybody's gonna laugh!

25:31.782 --> 25:34.195
- See you tonight!
- See you Sonia!

25:35.336 --> 25:37.850
Don't forget, today is my "birthday"!

25:57.211 --> 25:58.160
East station.

26:04.502 --> 26:07.537
- I have a feeling we've been screwed.
- I don't get it!

26:13.357 --> 26:14.399
What is this shit?

26:15.962 --> 26:18.043
Fox 3 calling Z1, over.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.127
This is Z1, come in Fox 3.

26:20.128 --> 26:23.252
A Mercedes with 5 passengers

26:23.253 --> 26:25.335
leaving exit Nｰ 3.

26:25.336 --> 26:27.986
We're heading toward the Louvre.
I repeat, the Louvre.

26:31.586 --> 26:33.668
Fox 4 calling Z1, over.

26:33.669 --> 26:34.710
Fox 4, come in.

26:34.711 --> 26:37.835
We're lost, the central just...
...Fox 3, Fox 3...

26:37.836 --> 26:40.960
An explosion has been reported
Boulevard des Italiens...

26:42.002 --> 26:44.085
Keep tracing the beeper! Damn it!

26:44.086 --> 26:46.168
Boulevard S饕astopol, armed robbery...

26:46.169 --> 26:48.252
Republic Plaza, armed robbery...

26:48.253 --> 26:52.418
...parcel bomb at Nation Square subway entrance...
- Damn...

26:52.419 --> 26:56.495
...fire at Montparnasse Station,
alarm at Pyr駭馥s Street Business Centre...

27:01.794 --> 27:04.198
Looks like your goofy plan
worked out after all!

27:04.519 --> 27:06.780
They're gonna be short staffed pretty quick!

27:06.781 --> 27:10.337
What are they gonna send us, huh?
Traffic wardens?

27:44.502 --> 27:46.385
Clodarec, these are decoys.

27:46.386 --> 27:48.768
- Mind your own business.
- Fox 3 calling Z1...

27:48.769 --> 27:51.593
Spin's over.
Heading straight to La Defense.

27:51.794 --> 27:53.676
We have to go now.

27:53.677 --> 27:55.427
Can't you see Christini is right?

27:55.444 --> 27:58.643
That all the mobile teams are dealing
with fake hits. They are ghosts.

27:58.644 --> 28:02.106
There are no cops left to deploy.
We must postpone.

28:02.107 --> 28:02.757
Not a chance!

28:02.836 --> 28:06.336
There's bound to be one real ghost
and I don't want to miss it, got it?

28:06.377 --> 28:08.227
So Christini, are you coming with us?

28:08.460 --> 28:11.760
For this kind of massacre,
I'm the one who sets the time and place!

28:12.627 --> 28:14.410
Let's go. Let's go!

28:14.411 --> 28:16.892
Isn't colourful stupidity a beautiful sight?

28:16.893 --> 28:20.870
These assholes couldn't find the enemy nｰ1
in a cereals box!

28:41.793 --> 28:44.917
Fox 4, calling Z1

28:44.918 --> 28:48.043
Fox 4 calling Z1

28:48.044 --> 28:52.120
Fox 4 calling Z1

28:53.251 --> 28:55.034
Fox 4, come in.

28:55.035 --> 28:59.280
The woman in the Lamborghini has just parked
the vehicle outside the Olympia Hotel.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.156
Awaiting instructions.

29:01.585 --> 29:03.668
I repeat, Fox 4, awaiting instructions.

29:03.669 --> 29:06.702
Isn't this a good opportunity
to take back the initiative?

29:06.807 --> 29:08.761
Depends. How do you see it?

29:08.876 --> 29:11.784
You deal with the Lamborghini and I'll lube the prefect by

29:11.787 --> 29:14.895
telling him what he wants to hear: the end of the Dobermann.

29:15.127 --> 29:16.389
What about Fox 4 team?

29:16.390 --> 29:19.090
Get rid of them. Clodarec's men are useless.
Fuck them!

29:19.093 --> 29:21.334
We are back at war.
Just you and me like before.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.389
Unless these clowns
can kill Dobermann.

29:25.252 --> 29:27.538
Tell me, what are the odds?

29:31.793 --> 29:33.875
Must you drive so fast?

29:33.876 --> 29:36.526
We don't even know where we're going!
For fuck's sake!

29:58.511 --> 30:00.594
The door, please!

30:07.849 --> 30:08.891
No!

30:25.960 --> 30:30.035
Fuck! She loves blasting stuff!

30:38.460 --> 30:39.500
This is Fox 1.

30:39.501 --> 30:40.541
Come in, over.

30:40.542 --> 30:42.625
They've broken in the bank of La D馭ense.

30:42.626 --> 30:44.708
Fox 1, get ready.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.793
- Hurry!
- Make up your mind!

30:49.918 --> 30:51.911
The blast ruined my eardrum.

30:54.084 --> 30:55.646
Miss...

30:55.751 --> 30:57.208
Maciste, did you see that?

30:57.209 --> 31:00.333
Bank, bang!

31:00.334 --> 31:02.217
You named him Maciste?

31:02.218 --> 31:04.499
Funny! When I was a kid,
I loved his movies.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.625
Bought all the tapes!

31:07.626 --> 31:10.660
They were great. Pity they don't
make them like that anymore.

31:14.918 --> 31:18.683
Z1 in the place,
report your current position.

31:18.684 --> 31:20.225
Don't stop, keep moving!

31:20.226 --> 31:23.876
Don't try anything on the boulevard,
too crowded. It would create a panic.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.499
Anyway, we've sealed off all escape routes.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.583
They can't get away. They're trapped.

31:31.584 --> 31:34.618
Trapped?
Your trap is too loose.

31:46.167 --> 31:47.208
They're leaving.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.250
David, keep up!

31:48.251 --> 31:49.891
What are you waiting for?
Hurry!

31:49.892 --> 31:52.617
Wait! They're slowing down.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.493
What?
They aren't hitting banks in a row?

31:59.709 --> 32:03.785
They're stopping at...
the front of the Union Bank

32:11.875 --> 32:12.932
Don't move!

32:13.552 --> 32:14.593
Quiet, quiet!
Shhh!

32:18.458 --> 32:20.542
What are they doing?

32:21.584 --> 32:22.533
Sir...

32:23.667 --> 32:27.543
Sir... I'm too old. I can't lie down.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.016
It's all right, you can stand up.

32:30.017 --> 32:32.000
- What?
- You can stand!

32:33.042 --> 32:35.035
What, I'm busy!

32:44.500 --> 32:45.541
I'm busy!

32:45.542 --> 32:46.982
Why don't you pay the rent?

32:46.983 --> 32:49.508
I just came to get 500 francs.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.791
You forget the rent!
You forget your child!

32:51.792 --> 32:52.832
No I did not.

32:52.833 --> 32:54.916
I have a bounced check!

32:57.000 --> 33:00.124
I don't want to bounce checks!
You owe me 30,000 Francs!

33:00.125 --> 33:02.208
- Huh?
- Thirty thousand, are you deaf?

33:02.209 --> 33:04.290
Who do you think you are?

33:04.291 --> 33:06.374
The queen of France?

33:06.375 --> 33:08.367
Take it, we aren't thieves!

33:29.123 --> 33:30.205
Go fuck yourself!

33:41.791 --> 33:42.740
At last.

33:48.041 --> 33:50.032
Good, let's go.

33:54.291 --> 33:58.367
Calm down, calm down.
Just wait.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.656
This is a trick.

34:06.791 --> 34:08.873
Trick? What trick?

34:08.874 --> 34:10.957
Two of them stayed inside the bank.

34:10.958 --> 34:13.993
They'll come out to drive the other car.

34:17.207 --> 34:19.290
No, they aren't coming out.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.315
Damn it!

34:21.816 --> 34:23.657
They aren't gonna fuck us like that!

34:23.658 --> 34:25.540
Z1 calling all Foxes.

34:25.541 --> 34:26.582
Clear all the exits.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.665
Don't act without my command.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.748
Repeat: follow my orders.

34:30.749 --> 34:34.615
I don't need a hostage situation
with fuckers like these.

34:34.616 --> 34:37.099
If our men in the car
don't report anything odd,

34:37.100 --> 34:39.182
the robbers inside will come out quietly.

34:39.183 --> 34:41.175
Then we catch them, got it?

34:41.513 --> 34:43.597
- Ok, Lefevre?
- Ok.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.373
It's going to get fucked up.

34:46.374 --> 34:48.357
No, it's not.
There are only two of them.

34:48.358 --> 34:50.740
There are six of us,
and they're not expecting us.

34:50.741 --> 34:52.731
Let's go! Let's go!

34:59.545 --> 35:01.108
Take shelter!

35:10.332 --> 35:12.415
Shit!

35:12.416 --> 35:13.365
It's me.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.991
For your first flight.
Do not land on a pylon, OK?

36:15.956 --> 36:16.906
Bastard!

36:23.249 --> 36:25.239
Don't move!

36:36.790 --> 36:38.783
Don't worry, it's nothing.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.324
Take that, cop.

36:58.665 --> 37:00.656
Don't...

37:01.790 --> 37:03.872
Well?

37:03.873 --> 37:06.077
His head ruined my gun!

37:15.332 --> 37:17.324
I don't like masks.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.423
- Hello.
- Yann, cops.

37:24.407 --> 37:26.689
They're still inside the bank.
What do we do?

37:26.690 --> 37:27.930
We'll be right there.

37:27.931 --> 37:30.966
We have to go back. Cops.

37:37.207 --> 37:38.758
Leo, the one on the motorcycle.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.590
The one on the motorcycle!

37:43.456 --> 37:45.447
Shit!

37:46.581 --> 37:48.664
Shoot, quickly!

37:48.665 --> 37:50.656
Shoot!

37:53.873 --> 37:54.914
Where is he?

37:55.956 --> 37:56.997
The invisible rider

37:56.998 --> 38:00.032
The messenger from hell

38:09.498 --> 38:11.489
Shoot him!
Hurry!

38:18.873 --> 38:20.956
Mother-fucker!
We take you for a spin!

38:21.998 --> 38:24.080
Visor!

38:24.081 --> 38:28.246
Faster, priest.
Grenade.

38:28.247 --> 38:30.238
No!

38:32.414 --> 38:35.538
Your light will shine like dawn...

38:35.539 --> 38:37.622
He's holding on!

38:37.623 --> 38:39.616
Your strength will...

38:42.831 --> 38:45.955
You call out to God,
He shall accept you.

38:45.956 --> 38:48.038
You shout.

38:48.039 --> 38:50.032
He'll say...

38:57.414 --> 38:59.405
Here I am.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.251
Wow!

39:10.793 --> 39:11.835
Amen!

39:11.998 --> 39:14.080
What is this? Blood?

39:14.081 --> 39:16.163
It's the rider's. It's stuck.

39:16.164 --> 39:17.204
Doesn't matter.

39:17.205 --> 39:20.331
It's not the rider's,
there's hair.

39:21.372 --> 39:24.497
Shit, Maciste.

39:24.498 --> 39:26.280
What are you doing?

39:26.281 --> 39:28.763
Give me his gun,
I want this to look like suicide.

39:28.764 --> 39:29.805
Good idea.

39:30.747 --> 39:33.497
What does this bitch want now?
She's gonna ruin the day!

39:34.914 --> 39:35.955
- Hello?
- It's Yann.

39:35.956 --> 39:38.038
Sorry, I thought it was my wife again.

39:38.039 --> 39:40.121
There are cops everywhere.

39:40.122 --> 39:41.904
Hold on, we'll be right there.

39:41.905 --> 39:44.488
- It's Yann. He's coming back for us.
- That's nice!

39:44.489 --> 39:46.371
There's still a ton
of cops out there.

39:46.372 --> 39:48.134
- I'll take care of them.
- Wait!

39:48.135 --> 39:50.118
Let's use that sucker as a shield.

39:51.581 --> 39:52.621
Move it, we're here.

39:52.622 --> 39:54.615
Come on, let's go.

40:12.414 --> 40:14.496
Hey! You idiots.

40:14.497 --> 40:16.579
Put down your weapons.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.571
Very good...

40:19.705 --> 40:21.696
Slowly

40:22.830 --> 40:24.913
Great

40:24.914 --> 40:26.905
Come on, pigs...

40:32.205 --> 40:33.247
Give me the gun!

40:36.372 --> 40:37.321
Thank you, sir.

40:41.580 --> 40:43.663
I am collecting guns.

40:44.705 --> 40:45.747
Taxi's here!

40:46.789 --> 40:47.738
Let's go.

41:13.872 --> 41:14.821
Lo・!

41:18.246 --> 41:21.694
I told you this would fuck up!

41:43.038 --> 41:46.163
We have won!
They have lost!

41:47.205 --> 41:48.246
They have lost.

41:48.247 --> 41:50.329
Not bad.

41:50.330 --> 41:52.320
Maciste?

41:53.454 --> 41:55.537
Where's Maciste?

41:55.538 --> 41:56.579
Sorry.

41:56.580 --> 41:59.704
I opened the door, he ran out.

41:59.705 --> 42:02.529
What? Then let's go back
and look for him.

42:02.530 --> 42:04.912
Cut the crap!
Cops will be here any minute.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.995
I don't care, I want my dog!

42:06.996 --> 42:09.078
Wait! Pitbull!

42:09.079 --> 42:11.162
Let me go or I'll kill you!

42:11.163 --> 42:15.239
Here is Maciste.

42:19.496 --> 42:22.621
The bike cop was shooting at us.

42:23.663 --> 42:24.704
God has punished him

42:24.705 --> 42:27.828
He is beheaded and gone to heaven.

42:27.829 --> 42:29.911
What?

42:29.912 --> 42:32.947
He means we blew his head off.

42:35.121 --> 42:37.726
I'll give him the best grave.

42:39.288 --> 42:42.322
No dog will ever get a grave like his.

42:45.538 --> 42:47.620
Then I will skin a cop alive!

42:47.621 --> 42:49.612
Sure.

42:50.746 --> 42:52.828
Of course.

42:52.829 --> 42:54.820
Fuck!

43:02.205 --> 43:05.328
Next!
Baguette sandwiches

43:05.329 --> 43:08.453
and cold drinks!

43:08.454 --> 43:10.537
Want hot sauce?

43:10.538 --> 43:13.662
No hot sauce, mustard.

43:13.663 --> 43:17.828
The whore left the hotel...
dressed like a man.

43:17.829 --> 43:18.869
A tranny?

43:18.870 --> 43:20.861
Yes, sir.
It's someone we know

43:21.996 --> 43:23.036
from Vice Squad.

43:23.037 --> 43:26.162
Olivier Brachet!
You remember?

43:26.163 --> 43:28.244
Sonia? The cock-sucker from Vincennes?

43:28.245 --> 43:30.328
That's him.

43:30.329 --> 43:33.453
Look what I've found in the car.

43:33.454 --> 43:36.578
Holy shit, that cock-sucking bitch
works for the Dob'!

43:36.579 --> 43:39.702
Great, where is that beauty queen now?

43:39.703 --> 43:41.786
Her parents' house,
around the corner.

43:41.787 --> 43:45.863
Good! Very good!
Let's go.

43:53.245 --> 43:55.236
- Aren't you eating?
- No, no.

43:55.329 --> 43:58.453
As you like.
Are they Fox 4?

43:58.454 --> 44:00.536
Tell them to get lost.

44:00.537 --> 44:03.571
Go, let's go. We're taking over.

44:06.787 --> 44:10.954
Has the commissioner assigned you?
Really?

44:11.996 --> 44:13.036
Son of a bitch!

44:13.037 --> 44:15.120
Go away!

44:15.121 --> 44:17.111
Leave me alone!

44:33.870 --> 44:35.861
Goddamn it.

44:38.037 --> 44:40.027
Shut the fuck up! Get lost!

44:46.829 --> 44:48.159
Do you understand?

44:54.703 --> 44:55.744
She's bleeding

44:55.745 --> 44:56.787
Police!

44:57.828 --> 44:58.777
Call the police!

45:00.954 --> 45:03.037
Lively neighbourhood, huh!

45:05.120 --> 45:06.069
I like it.

45:10.328 --> 45:13.363
It's delicious, Mom.
But too much.

45:13.454 --> 45:16.577
You're too thin, eat a little more.

45:16.578 --> 45:18.660
You didn't mention anything
about studies.

45:18.661 --> 45:20.745
There is nothing to say.

45:21.787 --> 45:23.138
When can you start working?

45:24.912 --> 45:27.515
I don't know, Dad.
It's not easy being a lawyer.

45:28.557 --> 45:29.908
You have a wife and family.

45:29.911 --> 45:31.569
We can't always take care of you.

45:31.570 --> 45:33.445
Listen.

45:34.287 --> 45:36.370
Now we can. Let him study.

45:37.412 --> 45:41.577
You eat, I'll get the door.

45:41.578 --> 45:43.661
Are you expecting anyone?

45:45.745 --> 45:46.785
What is it?

45:46.786 --> 45:48.256
Police. That's what!

45:50.953 --> 45:52.943
The Police.

45:54.078 --> 45:56.068
Sit.

45:59.286 --> 46:00.861
Hello, Sonia.

46:03.452 --> 46:05.536
Do you mind if
I call you Sonia?

46:07.619 --> 46:09.182
Then I'll call you Olivier?

46:09.703 --> 46:12.827
It'll sound better
in front of your family.

46:12.828 --> 46:14.391
Do you know them?

46:14.912 --> 46:17.306
If you want to talk,
we can go somewhere else.

46:17.307 --> 46:18.348
Why?

46:20.119 --> 46:23.244
Aren't we comfortable here?
It's family, Sonia!

46:23.245 --> 46:25.327
Why does he call you Sonia?

46:25.328 --> 46:26.891
Why don't you say anything?

46:27.411 --> 46:31.487
What the fuck are you doing
with the Dob', huh?

46:32.619 --> 46:34.612
Robbing banks for fun is not human.

46:34.676 --> 46:37.176
It's against the law
to despise money like that!

46:37.828 --> 46:39.910
One has to earn his money, right?

46:39.911 --> 46:41.473
To deserve it...

46:41.994 --> 46:44.077
But the Dobermann
only deserves a hole.

46:44.078 --> 46:48.245
A deep hole... six feet under.

46:49.286 --> 46:52.320
I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:54.494 --> 46:57.619
I am talking about the Dobermann,
you lousy faggot!

46:58.661 --> 47:00.652
Calm down.

47:03.869 --> 47:05.969
Obviously, being polite
is a waste of time.

47:09.077 --> 47:11.682
You're doing all right, Sonia?

47:13.244 --> 47:17.409
Must be, driving a Lamborghini.

47:17.410 --> 47:18.973
Is that marvel yours?

47:22.098 --> 47:24.181
You'd have to blow miles of cocks

47:24.182 --> 47:26.265
to be able to buy this car.

47:26.369 --> 47:28.869
I'm not quite sure
it's humanly possible.

47:29.910 --> 47:31.903
We found this in your car.

47:34.077 --> 47:37.202
This is what we are
more familiar with.

47:37.203 --> 47:42.320
You don't mind your son giving blow-jobs?

47:44.494 --> 47:49.612
You don't mind your son
sucking cocks all day?

47:50.744 --> 47:53.778
What? What is it?

47:54.336 --> 47:55.951
Assholes!

47:55.952 --> 47:58.036
Your mother is not very polite.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.227
Tell us they are wrong.

48:01.161 --> 48:02.202
Say it!

48:02.203 --> 48:04.284
Right.

48:04.285 --> 48:07.409
Say we got the wrong floor.

48:07.410 --> 48:09.493
Say it, say it!

48:09.494 --> 48:11.577
They're here for me.

48:13.661 --> 48:15.952
I'm not a law student,
I'm a prostitute.

48:16.577 --> 48:17.826
Shut up!

48:17.827 --> 48:18.867
I won't.

48:18.868 --> 48:20.509
You want me to become a lawyer,

48:20.510 --> 48:23.235
I've made it halfway:
I'm already an asshole!

48:24.077 --> 48:27.200
Mother, you don't have to
feed me medicine anymore.

48:27.201 --> 48:30.302
I'm always farting because
of getting it in the ass constantly.

48:30.899 --> 48:31.940
Shut up!

48:42.827 --> 48:45.951
Well done, Sonia.

48:45.952 --> 48:48.986
You would rather ruin your family...

49:22.410 --> 49:25.534
You even have a child.

49:25.535 --> 49:27.617
You fuck and you are are fucked.

49:27.618 --> 49:31.784
To fuck and be fucked.

49:31.785 --> 49:34.909
Where's the Dobermann?

49:34.910 --> 49:40.027
This child will say
that papa is a faggot.

49:43.243 --> 49:45.325
I love kids.

49:45.326 --> 49:47.317
No bullshit.

49:48.452 --> 49:50.534
I would have liked to have my own.

49:50.535 --> 49:52.618
We'd have fun together.

49:54.701 --> 49:56.785
That's right,
we'd have fun together.

49:56.919 --> 49:59.002
I'd have spent hours with him.

49:59.910 --> 50:01.486
But there is no time now.

50:05.118 --> 50:06.067
Julie!

50:14.493 --> 50:16.483
Don't move, bitch!

50:18.659 --> 50:20.809
Put this son of a bitch
back in its playpen.

50:22.826 --> 50:24.910
See what you are forcing me to do?

50:26.992 --> 50:28.875
Just to protect one asshole.

50:28.876 --> 50:30.116
Where is the Dobermann?

50:30.117 --> 50:31.979
I throw your kid and you don't tell?

50:31.980 --> 50:34.064
I hit your wife and you don't tell?

50:34.284 --> 50:36.277
What's in your fucking mind?

50:42.617 --> 50:44.610
Are you still dreaming?

50:54.076 --> 50:57.631
Such a shame,
especially on his birthday.

50:59.284 --> 51:00.847
No bullshit?

51:01.368 --> 51:02.840
It's his birthday?

51:07.617 --> 51:09.608
Changes everything.

51:11.784 --> 51:14.389
I don't want to be accused
of ruining a birthday.

51:14.910 --> 51:17.943
Even if the birthday boy
is ungrateful.

51:21.159 --> 51:25.235
Everybody should get a present.

51:45.117 --> 51:46.680
Here you go, son.

51:46.784 --> 51:47.837
Don't.

51:50.326 --> 51:51.378
Don't!

51:55.975 --> 51:57.538
Have a blast!

51:57.617 --> 51:58.879
Don't...

51:59.345 --> 52:00.908
Have a blast.

52:19.492 --> 52:22.096
You should have seen how
I blew his head off!

52:22.617 --> 52:24.180
The cop is gone.

52:24.701 --> 52:26.783
From the scope, man,

52:26.784 --> 52:28.346
it looks like a movie.

52:28.867 --> 52:31.380
Pity, no slow motion replay.

52:36.159 --> 52:39.282
But pigs all have hard heads.

52:39.283 --> 52:43.359
When I tried to kill him,
I failed. Fo fucks sake.

52:50.742 --> 52:53.346
Can you give a prayer for my dog?

52:54.908 --> 52:56.899
Kill him!

52:58.033 --> 53:00.117
A prayer for my dog?

53:02.200 --> 53:04.190
O.K.

53:15.741 --> 53:17.304
I'm off.

53:19.908 --> 53:20.857
So soon?

53:23.033 --> 53:25.024
Ciao, see you tonight at Jo's.

53:25.117 --> 53:27.198
Mos'!

53:27.199 --> 53:29.182
Mos'!

53:29.183 --> 53:31.065
- You want me to drive you home?
- No.

53:31.066 --> 53:33.649
You have an appointment
with Sonia at Jo's tonight?

53:33.650 --> 53:34.971
I want to get my car back.

53:34.992 --> 53:36.574
Call Sonia before you go.

53:36.575 --> 53:38.149
Why?

53:39.199 --> 53:41.982
Don't you think that the cops
were on our back a bit too soon?

53:41.983 --> 53:44.466
There were cops everywhere.
Isn't that part of your plan?

53:44.506 --> 53:46.389
Why not in our sector, huh?

53:46.992 --> 53:50.116
Two pigs down
and it's party time?

53:50.117 --> 53:54.192
I'm not gonna leave behind
a 300 grand car on a hunch.

54:03.657 --> 54:07.734
OK, I'll call him. Right?

54:18.870 --> 54:20.954
# Maci...
eh, calm down.

54:24.511 --> 54:25.553
# Maciste...

54:26.324 --> 54:27.365
Lord...

54:27.495 --> 54:29.578
# the little dog...

54:30.677 --> 54:33.803
# Everybody's grieving...

54:34.558 --> 54:37.162
# her sad destiny

54:50.334 --> 54:51.375
Amen!

55:42.615 --> 55:44.698
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Mosquito!

55:44.699 --> 55:45.740
It's you.

55:45.741 --> 55:48.865
No, stupid, it's the Pope!
How is my car?

55:48.866 --> 55:49.907
Just fine.

55:49.908 --> 55:50.948
You sound strange.

55:53.045 --> 55:56.692
The elevator's broken.
That's why I'm out of breath.

55:57.199 --> 55:58.240
Any problems?

55:58.241 --> 55:59.282
No, no problem.

55:59.699 --> 56:02.407
Your parents still there?

56:02.408 --> 56:04.489
They're washing dishes.

56:04.490 --> 56:06.573
Runs in the family!

56:06.574 --> 56:07.614
Why do you say that?

56:07.615 --> 56:10.740
Nothing, it's a family thing.

56:10.741 --> 56:14.816
- 'Bye
- See you tonight.

56:18.032 --> 56:20.114
So?

56:20.115 --> 56:23.240
They're going to Joey's tonight.

56:23.241 --> 56:27.316
Beside the Ourcq canal.
The club with a skull.

56:36.782 --> 56:38.772
You'll be there too.

56:40.948 --> 56:44.072
Freshen up, looking lovely,
wearing a smile.

56:44.073 --> 56:46.156
- Come on.
- I can't...

56:46.157 --> 56:48.148
Of course, you can.

56:49.282 --> 56:52.405
My man is a good cop.

56:52.406 --> 56:54.489
But as a baby-sitter
he's got no patience.

56:54.490 --> 56:57.094
Don't worry, Sonia,
it'll be a great party...

56:57.615 --> 56:58.656
A great party.

56:58.657 --> 57:00.648
You'll be the queen of the night.

58:00.115 --> 58:01.064
Champagne!

58:03.239 --> 58:06.363
The delivery men will be here
after noon. Follow?

58:06.364 --> 58:10.531
- What?
- The delivery men will be here after noon!

58:11.573 --> 58:12.614
What?

58:12.615 --> 58:13.657
Just one problem.

58:14.697 --> 58:15.738
Speak!

58:15.739 --> 58:18.863
We have to kill the duty officers
right from the start.

58:18.864 --> 58:21.989
Is that a problem?
You think this is a problem?

58:21.990 --> 58:25.114
No, I can kill them for you
if you want.

58:25.115 --> 58:28.239
There are two of them.

58:29.281 --> 58:32.315
Fine! Then I will kill them both.

58:34.490 --> 58:36.572
I like her. That Victoria!

58:36.573 --> 58:38.655
Robbing banks esta fine!

58:38.656 --> 58:40.739
Killing cops esta fine!

58:42.823 --> 58:46.899
- Blow my knob!
- Esta muy bien.

58:54.281 --> 58:56.363
Nature is rotten.

58:56.364 --> 58:59.488
What did he say?
What did you say?

58:59.489 --> 59:01.572
Nature is rotten.
No one loves no one.

59:01.573 --> 59:03.654
- What is rotten?
- Nature.

59:03.655 --> 59:06.780
All I see is a lion eating a fucking zebra.

59:06.781 --> 59:09.905
Zebra?
You don't know what a zebra is.

59:09.906 --> 59:11.988
I know it when I see it

59:11.989 --> 59:14.072
Here, there is a big zebra.

59:14.073 --> 59:18.238
The biggest in the world,
still eaten.

59:18.239 --> 59:20.321
Fuck! A zebra is quite something!

59:20.322 --> 59:23.447
Hey, Jo,
why don't you bring real women?

59:23.448 --> 59:26.571
What's the difference?

59:26.572 --> 59:30.218
Sonia said she sucked all of you,
you faggots!

59:30.739 --> 59:34.905
What is he saying?
I'll break his teeth!

59:34.906 --> 59:36.988
Calm down.

59:36.989 --> 59:40.114
You've got a woman,
stop complaining.

59:41.155 --> 59:44.281
I've been never sucked by a man. OK?

59:45.322 --> 59:48.357
Hey, in the dead of night
a mouth is a mouth!

59:51.572 --> 59:55.739
Fuck! How much longer do we
have to wait for that fucker?

59:56.781 --> 59:57.730
He's not coming.

1:00:00.947 --> 1:00:02.937
He'll come.

1:00:31.405 --> 1:00:33.147
I don't believe him, he's nuts.

1:00:33.239 --> 1:00:35.229
He's not crazy.

1:00:35.572 --> 1:00:38.357
Before I reached the age of one,

1:00:38.446 --> 1:00:40.529
he gave me my first gun.

1:00:40.530 --> 1:00:42.612
So what?

1:00:42.613 --> 1:00:46.779
That's Uncle Jo.

1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:48.250
Come.

1:00:57.197 --> 1:01:01.273
- What?
- There are cops everywhere.

1:01:02.405 --> 1:01:04.487
Stop being paranoid.

1:01:04.488 --> 1:01:09.606
You always think there are cops
everywhere.

1:01:10.738 --> 1:01:12.821
Not tonight.
I feel something bad.

1:01:12.822 --> 1:01:14.812
Let's get out of here.

1:01:23.238 --> 1:01:25.648
What are you waiting for?

1:01:29.488 --> 1:01:32.612
Don't touch me like this.

1:01:32.613 --> 1:01:35.737
You're blind.
I'm not blind, I'm only deaf.

1:01:35.738 --> 1:01:37.729
I know...

1:01:54.488 --> 1:01:55.529
What?

1:01:55.530 --> 1:01:59.606
Headquarters calling Luna 1.

1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:03.862
This is Luna 1, over.

1:02:03.863 --> 1:02:07.939
Commissioner, the prefect says
it's urgent that he speaks with you.

1:02:11.155 --> 1:02:13.237
You cut the radio?

1:02:13.238 --> 1:02:17.404
After I get rid of the Dobermann,
the Commissioner will kiss my ass.

1:02:31.988 --> 1:02:33.028
What is this?

1:02:33.029 --> 1:02:37.195
I'll take care of it.
If there are cops, the lights flash.

1:02:37.196 --> 1:02:39.278
Put that shit and the guns away.

1:02:39.279 --> 1:02:43.445
What's he talking about?
Why hide the gun if it's a cop?

1:02:43.446 --> 1:02:45.437
Come here...

1:03:08.446 --> 1:03:11.570
How are you, Mosquito?

1:03:11.571 --> 1:03:14.695
Next week, my darlings,
I'll be going to...

1:03:15.737 --> 1:03:16.686
New York

1:03:17.821 --> 1:03:19.903
When you see me again

1:03:19.904 --> 1:03:24.501
I'll have a cute little pussy

1:03:26.155 --> 1:03:30.230
and a huge clitoris!

1:03:43.862 --> 1:03:44.904
Fuck! He's here!

1:03:45.425 --> 1:03:47.628
I can't believe we've got him.

1:03:47.729 --> 1:03:50.112
Don't shout, it will make the child tense.

1:03:50.113 --> 1:03:52.194
Tell the Prefect to send all units.

1:03:52.195 --> 1:03:54.278
Why not ask for the Air Force?

1:03:54.279 --> 1:03:57.203
Listen, Christini, I don't know
what's in your mind

1:03:57.204 --> 1:03:59.586
but I know what these assholes
can do with guns.

1:03:59.587 --> 1:04:02.887
I am still going to call the Prefect
with or without your approval.

1:04:03.133 --> 1:04:05.750
Shut up! You're busting my balls.

1:04:09.904 --> 1:04:12.507
You got your chance.
You had the Dobermann at hand.

1:04:12.508 --> 1:04:15.112
Two men are dead
because you got scared.

1:04:16.153 --> 1:04:20.645
Shut up or I'll send you back
to the hospital, O.K.?

1:04:23.237 --> 1:04:25.726
Gangsters are like fine game.

1:04:25.946 --> 1:04:29.476
Tastes better when it's a little rotten.

1:04:32.570 --> 1:04:34.561
There... One more drink.

1:04:34.904 --> 1:04:36.466
And another.

1:04:38.029 --> 1:04:39.591
Smoke some pot.

1:04:40.112 --> 1:04:42.206
A fix... A line of coke...

1:04:43.237 --> 1:04:45.334
Give them time to have fun.

1:04:49.487 --> 1:04:51.479
Let them get stoned.

1:04:54.695 --> 1:04:56.777
We'll just wait by the door

1:04:56.778 --> 1:04:58.862
and catch them one by one.

1:04:59.904 --> 1:05:02.937
Like nasty ripe fruit
falling from the trees.

1:05:55.111 --> 1:05:57.194
You hid your drugs in your bullets?

1:05:57.195 --> 1:06:01.271
Cops would never look in there.

1:06:02.402 --> 1:06:03.443
Good idea.

1:06:03.444 --> 1:06:05.435
Take that, teddy bear.

1:06:06.569 --> 1:06:09.695
This'll blast your head off.

1:06:10.736 --> 1:06:12.819
You didn't remove the detonator!

1:06:12.820 --> 1:06:14.901
Why remove it?

1:06:14.902 --> 1:06:16.895
Yeah, why remove it?

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:23.522
Yeah! Lift off!

1:07:11.153 --> 1:07:14.276
Say, Teddy Bear,
how do you like me?

1:07:14.277 --> 1:07:18.443
With you, I feel like a woman.

1:07:18.444 --> 1:07:19.485
You're handsome.

1:07:19.486 --> 1:07:23.562
Don't look at me like that.

1:07:26.777 --> 1:07:28.859
What? Having a bad trip?

1:07:28.860 --> 1:07:30.851
Take a bit of this?

1:07:31.986 --> 1:07:33.976
Come...

1:07:43.444 --> 1:07:45.435
It stinks.

1:07:47.611 --> 1:07:51.776
Takes a son of a bitch
to fart in a car?

1:07:51.777 --> 1:07:53.339
The kid just took a dump.

1:07:53.860 --> 1:07:55.944
Go change him, it stinks!

1:07:56.986 --> 1:07:58.027
What?

1:07:59.069 --> 1:08:02.192
Mr Jo, a guy with a gun
is wanking in front of me.

1:08:02.193 --> 1:08:05.318
I'm paid to dance,
not to watch wankers!

1:08:05.319 --> 1:08:07.401
- It's Manu.
- That's right.

1:08:07.402 --> 1:08:09.485
What if everybody starts doing the same!

1:08:09.486 --> 1:08:11.568
Get back on stage, I'll handle it.

1:08:11.569 --> 1:08:12.611
I'll be right back.

1:08:14.693 --> 1:08:15.642
Right?

1:08:38.651 --> 1:08:41.269
Happy Birthday, Sonia.

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:58.351
Have fun.

1:09:04.693 --> 1:09:06.684
Yann!

1:09:09.902 --> 1:09:11.893
Thanks.

1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:17.343
Sit there and keep quiet!

1:09:18.114 --> 1:09:19.156
Fucking dancer!

1:09:19.249 --> 1:09:22.896
Doesn't fuck, doesn't suck!
And she doesn't even let you stroke!

1:09:24.265 --> 1:09:26.348
Cut the crap!
Stop sniffing that shit!

1:09:26.541 --> 1:09:29.145
You idiot!
My powder!

1:09:30.735 --> 1:09:31.836
What's wrong with you?

1:09:32.818 --> 1:09:35.942
I have a turtle-head poking.

1:09:35.943 --> 1:09:36.984
It's engaged.

1:09:36.985 --> 1:09:38.025
I can't wait!

1:09:38.026 --> 1:09:40.850
Going half mast
gives me knots in my stomach!

1:09:40.851 --> 1:09:43.734
Then go outside and take a shit.
Nature is there for you!

1:09:43.735 --> 1:09:48.643
- Nature? I shit on it!
- Yeah, now's the time.

1:09:49.485 --> 1:09:52.608
I'll show you what I do to nature!
You'll see!

1:09:52.609 --> 1:09:54.692
A group of lunatics!

1:09:54.693 --> 1:09:57.818
How can work with such morons?

1:09:58.339 --> 1:10:00.436
They are the best.

1:10:05.943 --> 1:10:06.998
Get lost!

1:10:07.197 --> 1:10:08.760
Hey, dick-head, what's wrong?

1:10:13.443 --> 1:10:15.525
I'm gonna shit in the canal.

1:10:15.526 --> 1:10:18.026
Fucks sake! Tell me he's not
going to piss over us.

1:10:18.651 --> 1:10:19.692
Who is he?

1:10:19.693 --> 1:10:22.818
Don't know.
But he's dead done! Good omen!

1:10:24.902 --> 1:10:26.891
Ah! He's not pissing.

1:10:28.026 --> 1:10:29.185
What is he doing?

1:10:29.541 --> 1:10:31.103
He shits!

1:10:56.151 --> 1:10:58.142
There you go... All right...

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:03.442
What's up?

1:11:05.394 --> 1:11:07.023
Holy shit! The kid!

1:11:07.024 --> 1:11:08.558
Stop! Police!

1:11:13.859 --> 1:11:15.329
What the f...

1:11:25.317 --> 1:11:26.617
I thought you tied her up!

1:11:29.483 --> 1:11:30.536
Fuck!

1:11:40.941 --> 1:11:42.934
Come here, it's all right.

1:11:45.108 --> 1:11:47.099
Bastard!

1:12:00.733 --> 1:12:01.681
Shit!

1:12:02.816 --> 1:12:04.806
No.

1:12:12.374 --> 1:12:15.498
Shoot all these cop killers!

1:12:17.399 --> 1:12:19.390
You go down. I go up.

1:12:27.295 --> 1:12:28.767
Take her to the car.

1:12:36.150 --> 1:12:37.150
Fuck! Yann! My cock!

1:12:38.232 --> 1:12:40.225
They shot my dick!

1:12:46.566 --> 1:12:48.559
Police! Get down!

1:14:44.273 --> 1:14:46.267
I can't see!

1:15:12.399 --> 1:15:14.388
Shit, the casings!

1:15:18.539 --> 1:15:21.143
- Faggot, faggot!
- No, no!

1:15:35.462 --> 1:15:36.932
Let's go! Damn it!

1:15:38.231 --> 1:15:40.435
Go ahead! We'll kill them all!

1:15:43.107 --> 1:15:44.723
I'll call the Prefect.

1:15:53.293 --> 1:15:55.377
Yann! Yann!

1:17:09.064 --> 1:17:11.147
That way. Careful!

1:17:11.148 --> 1:17:13.138
What are you doing? Careful!

1:17:24.689 --> 1:17:27.203
- Where's the Dobermann?
- Didn't find him.

1:17:53.855 --> 1:17:56.891
Why did the music stop?

1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:11.563
Why did the music stop?

1:18:11.564 --> 1:18:13.557
Get up, moron!

1:18:28.537 --> 1:18:30.621
Your brain all over the walls!

1:18:33.689 --> 1:18:35.251
Stop, for fucks sake!

1:18:35.631 --> 1:18:37.714
Stop! Something's wrong!

1:18:38.266 --> 1:18:40.350
Fuck, I knew it!

1:18:41.548 --> 1:18:42.589
Hang loose, asshole!

1:18:44.418 --> 1:18:46.501
Shut the fuck up!

1:18:52.886 --> 1:18:53.928
Take this!

1:19:03.907 --> 1:19:05.990
Take her away! Take her away!

1:19:14.094 --> 1:19:15.136
I got Mosquito!

1:19:21.897 --> 1:19:23.980
There! Enjoy!

1:20:11.261 --> 1:20:12.824
Oh God!

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:15.583
We praise Thee!

1:20:16.286 --> 1:20:17.849
Oh Lord!

1:20:18.495 --> 1:20:20.058
We glorify Thee!

1:20:20.526 --> 1:20:23.547
And you... poor sinner...

1:20:23.599 --> 1:20:25.162
Wow! Cut the crap, will you!

1:20:25.198 --> 1:20:26.760
It's the Apocalypse, my son!

1:20:27.833 --> 1:20:29.396
Hunters are everywhere!

1:20:29.500 --> 1:20:32.459
Hey! What were you doing
behind that glass, huh?

1:20:33.084 --> 1:20:35.167
Staring at my ass, huh?

1:20:37.042 --> 1:20:41.208
Ungrateful youth!
Unfaithful sinner! Come on!

1:20:48.334 --> 1:20:49.895
This way, we'll be safe.

1:20:50.937 --> 1:20:55.103
That's the old service tunnel.
It leads to the parking lot.

1:20:55.104 --> 1:20:57.708
When it's quiet, we can leave.

1:20:58.229 --> 1:21:00.313
There's enough beer to
last two weeks.

1:21:00.417 --> 1:21:04.062
Two weeks! He's mad!
I have to go look for my dick!

1:21:04.479 --> 1:21:06.561
What is that?
A security device?

1:21:06.562 --> 1:21:07.812
No... Just the sex-rooms.

1:21:08.346 --> 1:21:11.329
If here are video cameras,
they'll be right on our tails.

1:21:11.355 --> 1:21:14.894
Invisible, the walls have been built
around the system.

1:21:14.895 --> 1:21:16.889
Completely soundproof, very private.

1:21:20.588 --> 1:21:21.630
This way!

1:21:25.011 --> 1:21:26.051
This way!

1:21:33.646 --> 1:21:35.640
No arguing!
You know your way around!

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:41.979
Piece of shit!

1:21:43.020 --> 1:21:45.645
Don't waste it,
I don't have any more.

1:21:45.646 --> 1:21:48.828
- Do you know a solid prayer?
- I don't know if it'll be enough.

1:21:48.829 --> 1:21:50.931
- Pray anyway.
- Shit, what are you doing?

1:21:50.932 --> 1:21:52.495
Don't shoot, I have a hostage!

1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:53.921
Hold your fire!

1:21:54.479 --> 1:21:56.561
Please don't shoot!

1:21:56.562 --> 1:21:58.646
- We're coming out!
- He's crazy!

1:21:59.687 --> 1:22:02.082
Put down your weapons,
or I snuff the priest!

1:22:02.187 --> 1:22:03.764
They're together, idiots!

1:22:14.270 --> 1:22:18.347
The Lord be with us.
And His immense power...

1:22:18.437 --> 1:22:20.428
Stop praying. Get in the car.

1:22:21.562 --> 1:22:23.553
Get in, hurry!

1:22:28.853 --> 1:22:30.936
Sir, Officer Baumann.

1:22:30.937 --> 1:22:31.977
What about Baumann?

1:22:31.978 --> 1:22:34.061
His head has been blown off!

1:22:34.062 --> 1:22:35.115
OK, OK!

1:22:36.140 --> 1:22:37.702
Calm down, pigs!

1:22:38.389 --> 1:22:40.473
What a nice French police we have!

1:22:55.937 --> 1:23:00.014
Sonia, you're beautiful.

1:23:01.144 --> 1:23:03.135
Kiss me.

1:23:18.853 --> 1:23:22.930
Can I retrieve the transmitter now?

1:23:25.103 --> 1:23:27.096
Get this snitch out of here.

1:23:32.395 --> 1:23:36.472
No, it's not like that...

1:23:39.686 --> 1:23:43.852
When you die, I will paint
a swastika on your grave.

1:23:43.853 --> 1:23:45.935
We'll discuss decoration later.

1:23:45.936 --> 1:23:48.019
For now, take them upstairs.

1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:52.096
I'll make their tattoos talk! Go!

1:24:06.769 --> 1:24:10.847
Strange, everyone got busted...
Except you.

1:24:21.353 --> 1:24:23.347
You know the rules.

1:24:41.144 --> 1:24:45.221
Tell Yann, it was for the baby.

1:24:55.727 --> 1:24:56.769
Let's go.

1:24:57.811 --> 1:24:59.893
No... No... No, no...

1:24:59.894 --> 1:25:01.884
Stop, stop!

1:25:04.802 --> 1:25:06.243
We must get you out of here!

1:25:06.244 --> 1:25:08.226
No, I won't die.

1:25:08.227 --> 1:25:11.352
Forget about my little brother.

1:25:11.353 --> 1:25:14.476
Pay no attention
to what I'm saying.

1:25:14.477 --> 1:25:18.644
We can't get arrested
for a piece of cock!

1:25:19.586 --> 1:25:22.236
What do you want me to do?
You're pissing blood, Manu.

1:25:22.511 --> 1:25:23.952
Stop talking about piss.

1:25:23.953 --> 1:25:26.977
Come closer, don't make me shout!
It hurts!

1:25:28.019 --> 1:25:30.009
It's O.K.

1:25:33.227 --> 1:25:36.353
Remember our first robbery together?

1:25:37.393 --> 1:25:41.560
The post office on Duke Street?
We ran out, and then...

1:25:43.644 --> 1:25:45.794
A police car came,
I was going to surrender.

1:25:47.811 --> 1:25:49.804
You'd already drawn your gun.

1:25:53.019 --> 1:25:55.101
What did I do?

1:25:55.102 --> 1:25:57.185
You shot those bastards.

1:25:57.186 --> 1:25:59.268
That's right.

1:25:59.269 --> 1:26:01.259
Those sons of bitches.

1:26:03.435 --> 1:26:04.476
You told me...

1:26:04.477 --> 1:26:08.554
What did I tell you?

1:26:09.685 --> 1:26:11.676
What did I say?

1:26:12.811 --> 1:26:15.934
You said:
"Don't let the bastards get you.

1:26:15.935 --> 1:26:20.101
You're faster,
and you have better weapons".

1:26:20.102 --> 1:26:24.179
You're not going to hand me over
to these faggots?

1:26:25.310 --> 1:26:27.300
Manu...

1:26:34.685 --> 1:26:36.768
He's passed out.

1:26:36.769 --> 1:26:39.804
Look, it's Nat and Pitbull.

1:26:47.185 --> 1:26:49.789
Jacky Sueur a.k.a. Pitbull

1:26:50.310 --> 1:26:53.435
Yann Le Pentrec a.k.a. the Dobermann

1:26:54.477 --> 1:26:57.602
It's not a gang, it's a kennel!

1:26:58.644 --> 1:27:00.726
Jean-Claude Ayache, Mosquito!

1:27:00.727 --> 1:27:03.850
Elie Frossard, the Priest!

1:27:03.851 --> 1:27:05.935
Let me guess...
never heard of them! Huh?

1:27:08.018 --> 1:27:11.143
Depends, tell me which team...

1:27:11.144 --> 1:27:13.225
I may remember.

1:27:13.226 --> 1:27:15.308
What kind of sport do they play?

1:27:15.309 --> 1:27:18.345
We have pictures of you
with the Dobermann!

1:27:20.518 --> 1:27:22.602
You want my autograph?

1:27:23.643 --> 1:27:26.767
Isn't this the mark of your crazy gang?

1:27:26.768 --> 1:27:28.850
You all have it on your skin!

1:27:28.851 --> 1:27:30.425
I like dogs.

1:27:31.976 --> 1:27:35.102
The drug charge alone
will get you 15 years.

1:27:36.143 --> 1:27:38.225
More than that.

1:27:38.226 --> 1:27:40.308
Much more.

1:27:40.309 --> 1:27:43.434
The dead officers,
they all had families.

1:27:43.435 --> 1:27:45.517
I came for a friend's birthday party!

1:27:45.518 --> 1:27:48.642
Her name is Sonia, ask her.

1:27:48.643 --> 1:27:50.525
Her? You don't know her either?

1:27:50.526 --> 1:27:52.908
On her shoulder, she's got
the same tattoo as you.

1:27:52.909 --> 1:27:54.472
You don't know her?

1:27:56.976 --> 1:27:58.826
You can't deny
you know the Dobermann:

1:27:58.851 --> 1:28:01.141
he is your boyfriend.

1:28:01.142 --> 1:28:03.225
Poor fool!

1:28:03.226 --> 1:28:06.350
The Dob' got away,
you got prison for life.

1:28:06.351 --> 1:28:10.517
You're still young.
It's a long road.

1:28:10.518 --> 1:28:12.368
Especially when you can trust no one.

1:28:12.710 --> 1:28:13.752
Roles are reversed!

1:28:13.757 --> 1:28:17.720
Do you think he'll wank 20 years
waiting for you?

1:28:18.851 --> 1:28:20.934
What's that mean, 4?

1:28:20.935 --> 1:28:21.975
I get it.

1:28:21.976 --> 1:28:24.059
You get what?

1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:26.050
4! She sticks 4 in your ass!

1:28:27.184 --> 1:28:29.066
Bitch!

1:28:29.067 --> 1:28:31.550
You're finished. Game's over!
You're on your own!

1:28:31.551 --> 1:28:34.055
Where is your gang of losers?
Where?

1:28:34.060 --> 1:28:37.511
No one left!
Only two dog shits...

1:29:03.350 --> 1:29:05.342
Mother-fucker!

1:29:13.017 --> 1:29:15.099
Excuse me, David.

1:29:15.100 --> 1:29:17.705
Include the cleaning bill
on your expenses.

1:29:18.955 --> 1:29:21.261
This man is sick,
he should be locked up.

1:29:25.517 --> 1:29:27.508
There.

1:29:30.559 --> 1:29:32.965
Shit, Manu...

1:29:39.767 --> 1:29:40.929
No way.

1:30:05.058 --> 1:30:07.049
Wait. Wait!

1:30:08.225 --> 1:30:10.008
Yann, there are cops everywhere.

1:30:10.009 --> 1:30:12.891
- You take care of Manu...
- Wait at least until tomorrow!

1:30:12.892 --> 1:30:15.192
Don't leave him like that!
He wouldn't like it!

1:31:12.808 --> 1:31:15.322
- Leave her, I'm telling you!
- Get lost.

1:31:21.142 --> 1:31:24.266
Stop it, you're insane!

1:31:24.267 --> 1:31:26.257
Get lost!

1:31:27.391 --> 1:31:29.475
Go!

1:31:30.516 --> 1:31:31.465
Lousy shit!

1:31:36.974 --> 1:31:38.016
Christini.

1:31:40.620 --> 1:31:41.974
Christini!

1:31:41.975 --> 1:31:46.141
What kind of sick joke
are you playing?

1:31:46.142 --> 1:31:50.218
Shit! Don't fuck with me!

1:31:52.391 --> 1:31:54.382
Christini!

1:32:03.849 --> 1:32:05.549
You're not going to jail just yet!

1:32:05.933 --> 1:32:07.403
I'll fuck you first!

1:32:09.370 --> 1:32:11.573
You hear? You hear?

1:32:12.183 --> 1:32:15.215
You hear? Can't you hear me?

1:32:15.448 --> 1:32:17.219
You're gonna feel my cock! I swear!

1:32:20.516 --> 1:32:23.552
You can't hear my voice
but you'll feel my cock!

1:32:30.933 --> 1:32:32.734
I'm gonna fuck the Dobermann's girl!

1:32:36.141 --> 1:32:37.613
Here you are, faggot!
At last!

1:33:12.598 --> 1:33:14.589
I got you!

1:33:29.265 --> 1:33:31.777
Fuck you!

1:33:33.953 --> 1:33:36.051
You fuck me?

1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:42.806
Tonight we chop off
cops' heads for free!

1:33:42.807 --> 1:33:44.798
For Leo!

1:33:49.057 --> 1:33:51.047
For Pitbull!

1:33:59.474 --> 1:34:01.047
For Manu!

1:34:23.432 --> 1:34:25.422
Alive.

1:34:26.556 --> 1:34:28.547
I'm alive.

1:35:30.973 --> 1:35:32.054
God...

1:35:35.140 --> 1:35:37.262
Our lives are short and fragile.

1:35:38.431 --> 1:35:40.513
Death reminds us of this.

1:35:40.514 --> 1:35:43.639
But You are everlasting.

1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:46.764
Your love is greater than Death.

1:35:46.765 --> 1:35:49.888
We hand our brother...

1:35:49.889 --> 1:35:51.557
We hand our sister to You.

1:35:52.599 --> 1:35:53.694
Forgive her sins

1:35:53.764 --> 1:35:56.005
And welcome her
So that You may protect her

1:35:56.265 --> 1:35:59.003
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

1:35:59.265 --> 1:36:00.306
Amen.

1:36:38.847 --> 1:36:42.925
Honestly, this kind of burial
is suspicious.

1:36:44.056 --> 1:36:48.133
Listen Sonia,
you want the real thing?
