00:09.968 --> 00:11.834
<i>Last season on "The Arrangement"...</i>

00:11.968 --> 00:14.031
Hello?

00:14.138 --> 00:15.404
<i>You've only got two hours</i>

00:15.406 --> 00:17.406
until you read with Kyle West!

00:17.408 --> 00:19.241
<i>The whole world wants
to work with Kyle West.</i>

00:19.243 --> 00:20.242
<i>He could do whatever he wants.</i>

00:20.244 --> 00:21.343
<i>I'm going to Oslo.</i>

00:21.345 --> 00:22.779
It's the only way to stop this.

00:22.779 --> 00:24.740
What makes you think that you can stop it?

00:24.765 --> 00:26.104
You are amazing!

00:26.144 --> 00:28.544
<i>He's offering you a
contract marriage.</i>

00:28.546 --> 00:31.498
<i>So you want me to play
the girl on your arm.</i>

00:31.549 --> 00:33.102
What's your big secret?

00:33.102 --> 00:34.884
<i>I never thought
Lisbeth would just bail</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:35.867
<i>on me at our wedding.</i>

00:35.867 --> 00:37.208
<i>Did she ever explain herself?</i>

00:37.208 --> 00:38.908
<i>Something about getting
lost in my world.</i>

00:38.910 --> 00:41.044
<i>Any time my life has
ever gotten too big,</i>

00:41.046 --> 00:42.859
<i>Terence has always
been there to help.</i>

00:42.908 --> 00:44.575
I cannot do what you're asking me to do.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.282
I will end you in a heartbeat.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.740
<i>It's time for me to
face the consequences</i>

00:48.742 --> 00:51.311
<i>for what I did, and I am so sorry.</i>

00:51.311 --> 00:52.877
<i>Please stop!</i>

00:53.562 --> 00:54.617
I love you.

00:54.617 --> 00:55.849
<i>I just can't stop thinking about</i>

00:55.851 --> 00:56.838
<i>the way she looked at me.</i>

00:56.838 --> 00:58.022
I don't know what's gonna happen.

00:58.022 --> 00:59.619
Two months from now, you
are going to be prepping

00:59.644 --> 01:01.377
to direct "Technicolor Highway"

01:01.379 --> 01:03.613
<i>with Megan as your leading
lady, and your fianc√©.</i>

01:03.718 --> 01:05.331
Megan had some big breakthroughs.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.523
<i>- Thank you.
- She's not 100% there yet.</i>

01:07.525 --> 01:09.325
<i>Keep an eye on her. Make
sure things stay on track.</i>

01:09.327 --> 01:11.494
<i>I went through hell
to get back to Kyle</i>

01:11.496 --> 01:13.195
<i>and become part of the Institute.</i>

01:13.197 --> 01:15.664
<i>And now I'm here, and I need you</i>

01:15.666 --> 01:18.334
'cause I'm gonna burn the whole thing down.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.268
Hey, beautiful.

01:43.576 --> 01:45.271
Kyle, no!

01:45.773 --> 01:47.135
It's our moment.

01:48.446 --> 01:49.725
No!

02:09.752 --> 02:11.084
<i>But tonight is extra special.</i>

02:11.978 --> 02:13.620
Because we are here to
celebrate the engagement

02:13.622 --> 02:15.417
of two people I care about deeply...

02:15.919 --> 02:17.538
The shining lights of this family.

02:17.854 --> 02:20.154
And the beautiful wedding

02:20.156 --> 02:22.156
that we are all gonna be part of.

02:22.547 --> 02:23.859
To Kyle and Megan.

02:24.159 --> 02:25.747
To Kyle and Megan.

02:27.396 --> 02:29.162
Help me!

02:31.392 --> 02:33.726
The design concept will
incorporate the ten colors

02:33.728 --> 02:36.028
on the IHM life spectrum
into the service...

02:36.030 --> 02:37.429
...And my color is purple, which means

02:37.431 --> 02:39.932
I'll be your point person
for family planning.

02:39.934 --> 02:41.000
<i>...Into the ceremony,</i>

02:41.002 --> 02:43.546
so dresses, flowers, napkins,

02:43.571 --> 02:46.204
everything infused with the
spirit of the Higher Mind.

02:46.206 --> 02:47.472
Please!

02:47.474 --> 02:49.341
As we get closer to the wedding,

02:49.343 --> 02:52.077
if you have any questions, or
you want to just grab a coffee

02:52.079 --> 02:54.580
talk about fertility
or prenatal regimens...

02:54.582 --> 02:57.071
Okay, Sally, let's slow that roll.

02:57.072 --> 02:59.237
Of course.

03:02.086 --> 03:04.854
In this moment and every
moment that follows,

03:04.856 --> 03:07.722
we renew our affirmation
of life as a living thing.

03:07.929 --> 03:09.147
And as always...

03:09.147 --> 03:10.980
We build our column together.

Azhan designed Stevie
Jagger's wedding dress.

03:29.762 --> 03:31.528
And weren't you the Sultan of Brunei's

03:31.530 --> 03:32.796
personal dressmaker for two years?

03:32.798 --> 03:34.631
You made dresses for the harem?

03:34.633 --> 03:35.905
Don't remind me.

03:35.905 --> 03:38.713
But I am very excited for this dress.

03:39.008 --> 03:41.141
You are gonna be stunning.

03:41.617 --> 03:43.980
- First fitting tomorrow.
- It's amazing!

03:44.005 --> 03:45.119
- It's all happening, isn't it?
- Thank you.

03:45.121 --> 03:46.120
I know where I'm going.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.532
Excuse me. Sorry.

03:50.259 --> 03:52.326
Leslie, what are you doing here?

03:52.328 --> 03:54.228
Well, one thing I'm doing is making it work

03:54.230 --> 03:56.097
with the dress I wore to
the Independent Spirit Awards

03:56.099 --> 03:57.598
in 2014.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.376
We have got to get you
nominated for something.

04:00.376 --> 04:01.642
Hi, Terence.

04:01.644 --> 04:03.048
Well, you weren't invited.

04:03.048 --> 04:04.447
How did you know about this?

04:04.449 --> 04:06.215
Because I know how to
find things out, Megan.

04:06.217 --> 04:08.000
Because I'm a good agent.

04:08.219 --> 04:10.019
Stop by the office tomorrow afternoon,

04:10.021 --> 04:11.521
and I will have that information

04:11.523 --> 04:13.189
you were looking for, since you don't like

04:13.191 --> 04:15.477
to return phone calls anymore.

04:16.367 --> 04:19.067
There he is, the luckiest man in Hollywood.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.135
Don't I know it?

04:20.459 --> 04:22.726
Listen, I just stopped
by to say congratulations

04:22.728 --> 04:24.928
and to give you this
re-gifted bottle of Cristal.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.798
Oh, we'll send you a leftover mimosa.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.134
Leslie, how nice of you to crash.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.368
We have some business to discuss.

04:31.577 --> 04:32.943
Then this is good timing,

04:32.945 --> 04:34.511
since I'm sure it involves my client.

04:34.513 --> 04:36.313
Jason and Vic have a thought on the script.

04:36.315 --> 04:38.349
Um, they'd like to meet on Saturday.

04:38.351 --> 04:39.583
They have a thought.

04:39.585 --> 04:41.252
It's nothing major, they just want

04:41.254 --> 04:42.686
to see your character beefed up a little.

04:42.688 --> 04:44.221
Should we not get Ann Toren in on this?

04:44.223 --> 04:46.957
The writer? She's out of the country.

04:46.959 --> 04:49.260
Uh, who are Jason and Vic?

04:49.684 --> 04:51.138
The financiers.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.390
- We'll be there Saturday, right?
- Yeah.

04:53.392 --> 04:56.426
Did they actually use
the words "beefed up"?

04:56.428 --> 04:57.995
We're finished here, yes?

04:57.997 --> 04:59.396
They're ready for the walk out to the car.

04:59.398 --> 05:02.332
Okay, big smiles, very
in love, very romantic.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.935
The headline is "Hollywood's It Couple

05:05.323 --> 05:06.622
Having the Time of Their Lives."

05:10.061 --> 05:12.094
<i>So obviously, it's
all very hush-hush,</i>

05:12.096 --> 05:14.263
<i>but let's have a little fun
and predict what we think</i>

05:14.265 --> 05:16.165
<i>the Kygan wedding will be like.</i>

05:16.167 --> 05:18.334
<i>Okay, I mean it's
Kygan, so it's gonna be</i>

05:18.336 --> 05:21.070
<i>on some private island
somewhere in the no-fly zone.</i>

05:21.072 --> 05:23.139
<i>- You know what?
- My psychic actually told me</i>

05:23.141 --> 05:26.208
<i>that it's going to be very
small and very intimate,</i>

05:26.210 --> 05:27.777
<i>and also that I won't be invited.</i>

05:28.157 --> 05:29.612
Getting some ideas?

05:30.138 --> 05:32.612
I'm just unwinding my brain.

05:33.246 --> 05:34.997
Or destroying it.

05:35.575 --> 05:37.736
Well, do you wish we were
planning it ourselves?

05:38.344 --> 05:40.211
The contract is pretty clear

05:40.213 --> 05:41.646
that IHM plans the wedding, so...

05:41.648 --> 05:43.147
That's not what I'm asking.

05:43.149 --> 05:44.787
It was never really on the table.

05:46.342 --> 05:48.058
Plus, we're making the movie,

05:48.512 --> 05:50.412
and if we need to be
married before it's released,

05:50.414 --> 05:51.680
we don't even have time to...

05:51.682 --> 05:53.092
Okay, I get it.

05:53.517 --> 05:56.995
Let's just say for a second
that there's no contract,

05:57.455 --> 05:59.214
no publicity timeline,

06:00.057 --> 06:01.388
how would you do it?

06:06.871 --> 06:08.063
I don't know.

06:10.653 --> 06:12.352
I always figured that my wedding

06:12.354 --> 06:15.923
would be in someone's backyard in Brooklyn.

06:18.173 --> 06:20.761
With candles hanging in little mason jars.

06:23.968 --> 06:26.632
And now, I'm marrying one of the biggest

06:26.635 --> 06:28.785
movie stars in the world.

06:29.467 --> 06:32.050
I'm sure all of your people
are incredibly talented.

06:32.838 --> 06:34.918
- Mm-hmm.
- They're our people.

06:35.672 --> 06:37.418
And we could do mason jars.

06:38.173 --> 06:39.708
I just want you to be happy.

06:41.545 --> 06:42.960
I am happy.

07:04.103 --> 07:05.167
Wait.

07:05.989 --> 07:07.322
I can't. I'm sorry.

07:07.324 --> 07:08.423
What's wrong?

07:08.425 --> 07:09.966
I have my period.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.660
Oh, okay. Uh...

07:12.662 --> 07:14.515
Is it bad that I don't care?

07:16.205 --> 07:19.352
What's bad are these
cramps I'm having all night.

07:20.030 --> 07:21.463
It's really uncomfortable.

07:21.465 --> 07:22.731
Well, why didn't you say something?

07:22.733 --> 07:24.882
Well, I was trying to ignore them.

07:26.403 --> 07:28.155
Can we just snuggle?

07:29.620 --> 07:30.649
Yeah.

07:36.294 --> 07:39.395
Everybody crashes a bit after
the high of the intro workshop.

07:39.397 --> 07:40.696
I know I did.

07:40.698 --> 07:42.898
You have all of these exciting new tools,

07:42.900 --> 07:44.533
but you don't know how to put them to use.

07:44.535 --> 07:46.802
- Exactly.
- That's exactly how I feel!

07:46.804 --> 07:48.437
There's Mike. He is amazing,

07:48.439 --> 07:51.540
and he will talk seminar
ideas with you for days.

07:57.281 --> 08:00.049
Okay, bye!

08:00.487 --> 08:03.521
Can I interest you in a reflection break?

08:03.863 --> 08:05.520
You can.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.345
Megan!

08:09.835 --> 08:11.208
Did you have a good time last night?

08:12.038 --> 08:14.664
Yeah, it... it was wonderful!

08:15.997 --> 08:17.037
Great.

08:21.922 --> 08:24.256
Look, I can't just walk
into his glass office

08:24.258 --> 08:25.690
and start poking around.

08:25.692 --> 08:27.659
Okay, but you are IHM's lawyer.

08:27.661 --> 08:29.928
That has to give you some sort of access.

08:29.930 --> 08:31.763
Not as much as you think.

08:31.765 --> 08:34.157
Terence is extremely careful.

08:34.368 --> 08:35.700
I'm looking for vulnerabilities,

08:35.702 --> 08:37.335
but if he gets suspicious...

08:37.337 --> 08:39.191
I know what could happen. Believe me.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.480
I think about it every day.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.871
Right, so burning this place

08:43.895 --> 08:45.922
down is gonna take time,

08:46.360 --> 08:47.679
and patience.

08:48.519 --> 08:52.088
I want to help, but I
can't be your point person.

08:52.724 --> 08:54.357
I have to do my job.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.459
I'm not asking you to be the point person.

08:56.461 --> 08:57.952
I'm doing my own thing.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.763
Which is what?

09:00.131 --> 09:01.764
I'm gonna talk to Lisbeth,

09:01.766 --> 09:03.741
and find out what Terence put her through.

09:04.062 --> 09:06.563
Hopefully it's horrible and damaging.

09:06.565 --> 09:08.531
But I thought Lisbeth
didn't want to talk to you.

09:08.533 --> 09:09.894
And she's in rehab anyway, right?

09:09.958 --> 09:12.635
According to Leslie,
that's just a payback rumor

09:12.637 --> 09:14.537
for firing her publicist.

09:14.539 --> 09:16.372
You told Leslie what you're doing?

09:16.374 --> 09:18.975
Well, I just asked her to
help me track down Lisbeth.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.225
She's my agent. She works for me.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.298
Asking around about Kyle's ex.

09:23.298 --> 09:24.698
You don't think that's a red flag?

09:24.700 --> 09:27.267
I have to take some sort
of risks, Shaun, okay?

09:27.269 --> 09:29.934
I'm faking my way
through my life right now.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.301
And I'm sure Kyle senses it.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.050
It's not sustainable.

09:34.388 --> 09:35.905
And I don't even have the space

09:35.907 --> 09:38.186
to understand how I feel about him.

09:38.843 --> 09:41.911
How do you love someone
who did what he did?

09:42.242 --> 09:44.976
Maybe he really didn't
have a choice, like he said.

09:44.978 --> 09:46.377
I want to believe that.

09:46.379 --> 09:47.912
I want to believe that Kyle

09:47.914 --> 09:49.314
would never let someone hurt me.

09:52.252 --> 09:54.019
But everybody has a choice.

09:54.688 --> 09:55.753
Always.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.057
Including you.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.725
Either you forgive Kyle,

10:03.637 --> 10:07.232
and do what you need to do to
save the relationship, or...

10:07.234 --> 10:08.600
Or I don't.

10:10.237 --> 10:12.103
And he goes down with everything else.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.648
So I don't have any news about Lisbeth yet.

10:27.102 --> 10:28.329
Are you kidding me?

10:28.330 --> 10:30.664
I do, however, have some exciting things

10:30.667 --> 10:32.166
to tell you about your career.

10:32.168 --> 10:33.307
Leslie!

10:34.070 --> 10:35.770
You made it seem like
you had information, okay?

10:35.772 --> 10:38.039
- This isn't cool.
- What isn't cool?

10:38.041 --> 10:40.208
The producer meetings that I
set for you at Fountain Rock

10:40.210 --> 10:42.343
and Amazon Studios for next week?

10:42.345 --> 10:45.113
The 20 scripts I read
for you over the weekend

10:45.115 --> 10:47.181
while the baby chewed my nipple off?

10:47.677 --> 10:50.678
Gay spies in Paris. How cool is that?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.647
How about setting up your
own production company?

10:52.649 --> 10:56.084
How about breaking my back
to make sure you have a job

10:56.086 --> 10:57.385
after "Technicolor Highway" ends?

10:57.387 --> 10:59.220
It's all amazing, okay?

10:59.222 --> 11:01.489
But you totally misled me,

11:01.491 --> 11:03.892
and I need to be able to trust you.

11:03.894 --> 11:05.193
To trust me!

11:05.195 --> 11:07.428
Megan, are they asking you to drop me?

11:10.455 --> 11:12.433
- What? No!
- You're a shitty liar.

11:12.435 --> 11:13.968
No, Terence, DeAnn, and Kyle,

11:13.970 --> 11:15.670
nobody's said a word to me about you.

11:15.672 --> 11:18.673
Of course not, because you
act like I don't even exist!

11:19.184 --> 11:21.802
You know, the last time you
were remotely straight with me,

11:21.827 --> 11:24.500
you were begging for $5 million!

11:25.070 --> 11:28.872
Look, I don't know how Terence
made your problem go away,

11:28.874 --> 11:31.321
I don't care, and if you
have to be one of his acolytes

11:31.346 --> 11:34.214
as part of that deal, that's fine with me!

11:34.239 --> 11:37.340
But do not let that
man mess with your gift!

11:37.556 --> 11:41.458
- So you're my gift now? Okay.
- No, your acting is your gift.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.226
But if you don't put it in the hands

11:43.228 --> 11:45.295
of somebody who actually cares about you,

11:45.297 --> 11:47.030
then you're just pissing it away!

11:47.032 --> 11:49.265
You can be an A-list actor

11:49.267 --> 11:52.035
or you can be an A-list
adjacent girlfriend,

11:52.037 --> 11:54.204
- that is your choice.
- I know!

11:54.532 --> 11:57.266
You're my agent, and I can't
do any of this without you.

11:57.268 --> 11:58.717
Believe me, I know that.

11:58.744 --> 12:01.346
But you are not my girlfriend, okay?

12:01.346 --> 12:05.215
I pay you 10% so I don't
have to return your calls

12:05.217 --> 12:07.062
or tell you what's going on in my life.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.863
Lisbeth is taking meditation classes

12:19.865 --> 12:22.132
at Audio Bath Collective.

12:22.671 --> 12:24.278
Usually at night.

12:24.673 --> 12:27.626
I had one of the assistants
stalk her eyebrow person.

12:28.209 --> 12:29.175
Thank you.

12:29.177 --> 12:30.530
You're welcome.

12:31.097 --> 12:34.647
And I'm... I'm really excited
about gay spies in Paris.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.231
Megan, you had me at, "You're my agent."

12:41.628 --> 12:43.382
<i>Audio Bath. How may I help?</i>

12:43.819 --> 12:45.652
Hi, I'm trying to make an appointment

12:45.653 --> 12:46.953
for my boss for tonight's class.

12:46.955 --> 12:48.323
Is there still space?

12:48.532 --> 12:50.753
<i>We have a few spots
left. What's the name?</i>

12:51.159 --> 12:52.595
Graves, Lisbeth.

12:52.827 --> 12:55.439
<i>Um, we already have
Lisbeth down for tonight.</i>

12:55.597 --> 12:57.563
Oh, never mind. I'm the new assistant.

12:57.565 --> 12:59.365
I'm still getting my signals crossed.

12:59.367 --> 13:00.695
<i>No problem at all.</i>

13:01.088 --> 13:02.874
<i>Maybe you should
come in for a class.</i>

13:03.556 --> 13:04.880
Maybe I will.

13:26.466 --> 13:28.224
There's the bride to be!

13:28.783 --> 13:30.550
Late, as always, better than never.

13:30.552 --> 13:33.085
I am so sorry. There
was a horrible accident

13:33.087 --> 13:35.021
on the PCH and my phone died.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.589
Well, let's just give
you a little something

13:36.591 --> 13:38.148
to turn things around!

13:39.417 --> 13:41.184
You forgot about the fitting didn't you?

13:41.186 --> 13:43.245
Yes, I did.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.988
These just came from Kyle.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.141
Oh!

13:50.562 --> 13:53.262
_

13:53.806 --> 13:54.864
Megan!

13:55.340 --> 13:56.473
Megan!

13:56.901 --> 13:58.634
Come take a look at your dress.

14:08.470 --> 14:10.446
The elegance of tradition,

14:11.110 --> 14:13.177
and the beauty of forward thought.

14:14.689 --> 14:16.749
And this is just the beginning.

14:17.292 --> 14:19.426
Probably should've told you
that this would all be part of

14:19.428 --> 14:21.394
the wedding exclusive for "People."

14:21.396 --> 14:23.329
Guys, maybe just a touch more room?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.397
It's beautiful.

14:35.653 --> 14:37.417
You are a dangerous man.

14:38.756 --> 14:40.455
- Another round?
- No.

14:40.457 --> 14:42.724
I can't really get motivated
if there's no actual threat.

14:44.007 --> 14:45.007
Oh.

14:45.032 --> 14:46.674
Screw the money. Let's shoot at each other.

14:46.674 --> 14:48.114
Why don't you hop out there?

14:48.483 --> 14:49.629
Are you kidding me? The last thing I need

14:49.631 --> 14:51.156
is your blood on my hands.

14:51.346 --> 14:52.811
At least you got confidence.

14:53.835 --> 14:55.653
I'm Terence Anderson, son.

14:57.339 --> 14:59.405
Besides, life is better with
us on the same side of things,

14:59.407 --> 15:00.885
don't you agree?

15:01.309 --> 15:02.726
It's definitely easier.

15:04.052 --> 15:06.753
What? That's it? Come on.

15:07.088 --> 15:08.724
Still bumps in the road, my friend.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.523
Like what? Problems with Megan?

15:10.525 --> 15:11.579
No.

15:12.049 --> 15:14.394
My problem is guys that have
never made a movie before

15:14.396 --> 15:15.562
asking me for script changes.

15:15.564 --> 15:16.996
Yeah, well, money talks.

15:16.998 --> 15:18.598
Yeah, well, money should shut the hell up.

15:18.893 --> 15:20.760
Look, "Technicolor
Highway" is not gonna suffer

15:20.762 --> 15:22.561
from a little more Kyle West,
then it's asses in the seats,

15:22.563 --> 15:23.729
and that's good for everybody.

15:23.731 --> 15:25.097
Asses are gonna be in the seats

15:25.099 --> 15:26.332
because it's gonna be a great movie.

15:26.334 --> 15:27.400
Not because I'm in it.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.903
I know how personal this
story is for you, Kyle.

15:30.905 --> 15:32.338
And that's... that's fine.

15:32.712 --> 15:34.845
And art is therapy. I get it, but...

15:34.847 --> 15:36.299
Art is redemption, buddy.

15:36.716 --> 15:38.549
So you think if you make a great movie

15:38.551 --> 15:40.384
you're gonna be able to
forgive yourself for you past?

15:40.386 --> 15:41.478
Is that it?

15:42.355 --> 15:44.288
With this movie, maybe.

15:49.162 --> 15:50.886
Did you notice how energized everyone was

15:50.911 --> 15:52.481
at dinner the other night?

15:52.534 --> 15:54.498
Everyone at IHM? Hmm?

15:55.025 --> 15:57.328
You know why? Because of you.

15:57.828 --> 15:59.453
Because you're back in the fold.

16:00.497 --> 16:02.698
Kyle, your presence inspires people,

16:02.700 --> 16:04.590
so you want redemption? Harness that!

16:05.060 --> 16:07.053
In the movie, and otherwise.

16:07.918 --> 16:09.051
Otherwise?

16:09.314 --> 16:10.819
IHM needs to grow.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.298
People shouldn't come
from all over the country

16:12.330 --> 16:13.575
to do the work.

16:13.576 --> 16:14.809
Within the next five years,
you and I should make sure

16:14.811 --> 16:16.187
we are in everybody's backyard.

16:17.213 --> 16:19.414
Yeah, well, I'm not looking
past the next five months.

16:19.849 --> 16:21.716
Make the movie, marry Megan.

16:21.718 --> 16:23.078
It's as simple as that.

16:23.319 --> 16:25.475
Why exactly does IHM need to grow?

16:26.572 --> 16:28.371
' Cause if you're not
growing, you're dying.

16:32.962 --> 16:36.103
_

16:40.547 --> 16:43.105
_

16:44.792 --> 16:47.591
_

16:47.970 --> 16:49.603
So what do we think?

17:02.308 --> 17:04.809
It's gorgeous!

17:05.288 --> 17:07.387
She was made to wear this dress.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.816
The question is what does she think?

17:11.230 --> 17:13.063
I don't know what to think right now.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.423
I have something for you.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
What is that?

17:23.064 --> 17:24.775
This was my mother's.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.646
She wore it at her wedding,

17:28.648 --> 17:30.902
and she gave it to me to wear at mine,

17:33.630 --> 17:36.453
and if you're willing,
I'd like to give it to you.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.222
Of course.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.297
It's beautiful.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.932
DeAnn, thank you.

17:47.934 --> 17:48.899
You're welcome.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.601
You look beautiful.

18:14.641 --> 18:16.207
We should just get married here.

18:17.957 --> 18:19.377
In the house?

18:19.379 --> 18:20.845
I'm just picturing you
coming down that staircase

18:20.847 --> 18:23.132
in a wedding dress, and I
am getting all the feels.

18:23.157 --> 18:24.515
You're sweet.

18:24.517 --> 18:27.082
And thanks for the
flowers. They're beautiful.

18:27.679 --> 18:28.689
Of course.

18:29.222 --> 18:30.355
How was the fitting?

18:30.357 --> 18:31.856
Azhan's supposed to be a genius.

18:32.086 --> 18:34.159
Yeah, he's amazing.

18:34.441 --> 18:36.327
The dress is gorgeous.

18:36.952 --> 18:38.029
Good.

18:38.430 --> 18:39.796
You headed to yoga?

18:40.113 --> 18:41.341
Meditation.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.666
Actually, I have to hustle.

18:45.337 --> 18:47.013
Meditation sounds amazing.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.809
Maybe I'll go. Do you mind?

18:48.811 --> 18:52.346
Just pulling my hair out
with all these script changes.

18:52.725 --> 18:54.035
Maybe we can talk on the way.

18:54.036 --> 18:55.869
It's a women's class, actually.

18:55.871 --> 18:56.970
Women only.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.371
Perfect.

18:58.373 --> 19:00.020
Who wants to meditate
with a bunch of dudes?

19:01.765 --> 19:04.107
Look, you're the only one
that gets this thing like I do.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.912
We'll talk when I get back.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.633
All right, I don't want to be late.

19:16.784 --> 19:19.985
Now, we begin the process of letting go.

19:22.790 --> 19:25.707
Let go of your day.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.449
Let go of your goals.

19:30.877 --> 19:34.179
Let go of the need to do this right.

19:37.717 --> 19:40.385
Let go and the sound will take you

19:40.387 --> 19:42.420
wherever you're supposed to go.

19:48.886 --> 19:50.744
<i>No, completely understandable,</i>

19:50.744 --> 19:53.745
but just so I'm clear, there's
nothing inherently problematic

19:53.747 --> 19:57.138
about the First Life
program, it's just that you...

19:58.893 --> 20:00.044
Precedent.

20:00.428 --> 20:01.500
Right.

20:01.796 --> 20:03.690
Nope, understood.

20:03.798 --> 20:05.337
Oh, no, thank you.

20:05.499 --> 20:08.172
I will check back in a
few weeks, like you said.

20:08.736 --> 20:10.533
All right. Bye-bye.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.433
Hey, I know you.

20:29.435 --> 20:30.703
Hey.

20:31.071 --> 20:32.270
How are you doing?

20:32.271 --> 20:34.507
Great! How are you?

20:36.191 --> 20:37.675
I'm well.

20:38.225 --> 20:41.304
"Well." Well, that's proper English.

20:43.145 --> 20:44.645
Yeah, I-I was just gonna go.

20:44.647 --> 20:46.480
So thank you.

20:46.897 --> 20:47.969
Um...

20:49.318 --> 20:50.918
Oh, okay.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.245
Great to see you.

20:54.248 --> 20:56.182
Yeah, good to see you too.

21:00.451 --> 21:01.516
You know, that...

21:01.789 --> 21:04.990
That was like watching
little animals get tortured.

21:06.594 --> 21:07.960
I'm sure it was.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.396
Yeah, ever since we... ended things,

21:10.398 --> 21:12.898
I don't know what to say to him exactly.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.433
Oh, don't worry.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.840
You're being very clear.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.024
Okay.

21:17.024 --> 21:18.804
And at least now I know why
he's been pushing so hard

21:18.829 --> 21:20.662
to go work at the Facility.

21:21.097 --> 21:22.331
He's running.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.472
Oh.

21:25.311 --> 21:27.073
So you came to see me?

21:28.177 --> 21:29.540
Right.

21:30.243 --> 21:33.244
I just got off the phone
with Scholastic Associates.

21:33.246 --> 21:34.783
They're hedging.

21:35.215 --> 21:37.311
We are talking about revolutionizing

21:37.336 --> 21:38.635
childhood education.

21:38.637 --> 21:39.703
What the hell's their problem? Money?

21:39.705 --> 21:40.780
I don't think so.

21:40.781 --> 21:42.581
They say they like the
First Life Initiative,

21:42.583 --> 21:45.584
but they've never partnered
with an organization

21:45.586 --> 21:47.955
so regional in nature.

21:49.074 --> 21:50.129
That's just code

21:50.129 --> 21:52.763
for California hippie dippie bullshit.

21:53.210 --> 21:55.323
Do you want to reach out to them yourself?

21:56.061 --> 21:57.427
You might have more luck.

21:57.429 --> 21:59.144
No, this isn't about me.

22:01.366 --> 22:02.732
We need a breakthrough.

22:04.628 --> 22:06.106
_

22:37.445 --> 22:38.964
It's okay.

22:43.899 --> 22:45.041
It's okay.

22:46.108 --> 22:47.242
Just breathe.

22:48.312 --> 22:49.648
You're here now.

22:49.691 --> 22:50.945
You're safe.

22:52.660 --> 22:54.026
Just breathe.

22:56.998 --> 22:59.902
Okay, this is a completely safe space.

23:00.335 --> 23:03.695
You just need to keep breathing

23:03.905 --> 23:05.705
and listening.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.645
Namaste.

23:18.689 --> 23:19.788
How you doing?

23:20.318 --> 23:21.825
Oh, excuse me.

23:29.792 --> 23:30.799
Shit.

23:39.596 --> 23:41.743
Why are you following me?

23:41.968 --> 23:43.534
- Jesus.
- Answer me!

23:44.004 --> 23:46.271
I am so sorry, I just... I
really want to talk to you.

23:46.273 --> 23:48.407
Yeah, I was very clear with you.

23:48.409 --> 23:51.920
I know, but a lot has
happened since Venice.

23:51.945 --> 23:53.045
Oh, you think so?

23:53.479 --> 23:55.714
Wait until Kyle and Terence
find out you're doing this!

23:56.104 --> 23:57.336
See what happens then!

23:57.338 --> 23:58.971
Look, you said you love him,

23:58.973 --> 24:01.347
and I just want to know why you left.

24:01.910 --> 24:03.323
Was it Terence?

24:03.845 --> 24:05.144
Did he force you?

24:06.781 --> 24:08.436
Yeah, I know what you're trying to do.

24:08.945 --> 24:10.144
I can't help you.

24:10.146 --> 24:11.779
You can't separate them. It's impossible.

24:11.781 --> 24:14.115
Why? Why would you say that?

24:16.058 --> 24:17.452
Just leave me alone.

24:17.896 --> 24:19.821
Just, please, what did he do to you?

24:21.825 --> 24:23.367
I'm so sorry.

24:23.949 --> 24:25.582
I just really want to talk to you!

24:25.584 --> 24:28.800
Okay, your energy is
really dark and destructive.

24:29.566 --> 24:31.188
Stay away from me!

24:41.017 --> 24:43.436
The problem is there's no
obvious way to make the changes

24:43.461 --> 24:44.834
they're asking for.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.397
<i>You know where creative
blocks come from.</i>

24:46.443 --> 24:47.942
Old ideas you can't let go of.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.077
I know the academics.

24:49.352 --> 24:50.517
I need a tool.

24:50.519 --> 24:51.626
<i>Here's a tool.</i>

24:52.688 --> 24:54.148
<i>Put down the script for an hour,</i>

24:54.148 --> 24:55.750
<i>and write a speech for
the Sunday gathering.</i>

24:55.790 --> 24:56.915
This Sunday?

24:56.917 --> 24:58.650
You know I'm not going, let alone speaking.

24:58.842 --> 25:00.275
<i>Well, you can lose
that argument later.</i>

25:00.277 --> 25:02.444
<i>Write a speech now, as an exercise.</i>

25:02.658 --> 25:04.391
My plate is full enough, Terence.

25:04.393 --> 25:06.611
<i>Really? Are you
getting any of it done?</i>

25:06.862 --> 25:08.028
<i>Trust me, Kyle.</i>

25:08.447 --> 25:10.296
<i>Write from the heart.
It'll open your mind.</i>

25:12.752 --> 25:14.132
What are you eating?

25:15.155 --> 25:16.745
Banana bread and chocolate chip.

25:17.123 --> 25:19.570
Wait, who made you
banana bread, you bastard?

25:19.926 --> 25:21.326
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

25:22.863 --> 25:24.028
Save me some.

25:24.030 --> 25:25.096
<i>Write the speech.</i>

25:25.098 --> 25:26.231
I gotta go.

25:29.366 --> 25:31.936
How was meditation with the ladies?

25:32.227 --> 25:33.386
Good.

25:34.029 --> 25:35.629
You want to talk about the script now?

25:35.631 --> 25:36.763
No.

25:37.099 --> 25:38.950
I want to know how you're feeling first.

25:40.319 --> 25:41.646
About the script?

25:42.022 --> 25:43.130
About me.

25:45.225 --> 25:47.325
You're the love of my life.

25:47.661 --> 25:49.174
Why would you ask me that?

25:49.963 --> 25:52.130
Because six months ago,
we signed a contract,

25:52.353 --> 25:53.892
and we barely knew each other.

25:54.388 --> 25:57.222
Now we're planning a
wedding, making a movie,

25:57.223 --> 25:59.423
and everything's coming at
us a million miles an hour.

25:59.729 --> 26:01.712
So I look to you,

26:02.780 --> 26:04.880
'cause I think you got to be
feeling the same way, but...

26:06.845 --> 26:08.684
I just feel like you're not there.

26:11.363 --> 26:12.595
I'm here.

26:13.898 --> 26:15.965
Okay, I'm right here.

26:19.904 --> 26:23.139
And I'm sorry if I've
been distracted lately.

26:23.423 --> 26:24.596
You're right.

26:25.087 --> 26:26.767
There's a lot going on.

26:27.949 --> 26:29.512
Is it just distraction?

26:29.975 --> 26:32.375
I mean what about what
you had to go through?

26:34.580 --> 26:36.803
Well, it's no more than
what you've been through.

26:37.671 --> 26:39.638
Megan, look, I asked to go to the Facility.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.699
You didn't.

26:41.038 --> 26:42.875
And I know you said it
was all for the best,

26:42.877 --> 26:45.177
but it would be normal
for you to have feelings

26:45.179 --> 26:46.696
about how it all went down.

26:47.457 --> 26:50.446
Like anger towards me.

26:53.921 --> 26:55.315
The feelings I have...

26:56.395 --> 26:57.700
are gratitude.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.855
And love.

27:07.928 --> 27:09.961
<i>No, Kyle! Please, no!</i>

27:09.963 --> 27:11.563
You knew about this!

27:11.565 --> 27:12.564
Hey!

27:14.434 --> 27:16.000
I love you.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.718
Hello.

27:51.845 --> 27:53.120
Oh, my God.

27:59.353 --> 28:01.386
Here, let me help you with that.

28:05.164 --> 28:06.285
You're home early.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.483
Yes, well traffic was light.

28:10.374 --> 28:11.796
I'm going to go.

28:17.337 --> 28:19.377
She seems smart for 23.

28:20.218 --> 28:21.625
22, actually.

28:21.986 --> 28:23.452
How was your chat with Kyle?

28:23.454 --> 28:26.022
Kyle's blocked. I told him to take a break.

28:26.024 --> 28:28.024
And just let the script rewrite itself?

28:28.299 --> 28:30.365
No. Let it marinate
while he writes a speech

28:30.367 --> 28:31.815
for the Sunday gathering.

28:31.815 --> 28:33.370
You think the script is gonna marinate?

28:35.657 --> 28:37.786
You would do well to be a
little bit more discreet.

28:38.347 --> 28:39.880
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

28:39.882 --> 28:41.995
You don't think Kyle has
a future as a director.

28:42.284 --> 28:44.518
Maybe he doesn't, but
he's emotionally attached

28:44.520 --> 28:45.519
to this movie.

28:45.521 --> 28:46.987
So if you want to hold on

28:46.989 --> 28:48.455
to the institute's cash cow,

28:48.457 --> 28:51.041
you might want to at
least act like you care.

28:57.212 --> 28:58.865
Sorry about the tie on the door.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.233
No, you're not.

29:00.587 --> 29:02.869
No, I'm not. It's what's
bothering you, though.

29:17.511 --> 29:19.511
_

29:29.740 --> 29:32.574
So Kyle has been thinking of ways

29:32.576 --> 29:34.543
to address your concerns,

29:34.545 --> 29:37.312
and I think he's come up with
some really interesting ideas

29:37.314 --> 29:39.047
for increasing Hooper's
presence in the movie.

29:39.049 --> 29:41.393
And just to be clear, we love Clyde.

29:41.418 --> 29:42.762
We don't want to change her.

29:42.762 --> 29:44.629
Yeah, and one of the
things we love about Clyde

29:44.630 --> 29:46.692
- is that her name is Clyde.
- Awesome.

29:46.717 --> 29:47.964
You're just embarrassing yourself

29:47.966 --> 29:49.866
'cause I'm going in anyway.

29:49.868 --> 29:51.850
Sorry, sorry, you know how

29:51.875 --> 29:54.037
it is with sitters on a Saturday.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.592
Who is this?

29:55.795 --> 29:58.108
This is my agent, Leslie Bellcamp.

29:58.133 --> 29:59.214
Hi.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.949
Just staying up to speed so I
can best represent my client.

30:03.353 --> 30:05.017
This is very exciting.

30:06.921 --> 30:10.223
- Uh, Kyle, uh, you were...
- Yes, um...

30:10.844 --> 30:13.144
I've been doing some
thinking, as DeAnn said,

30:13.280 --> 30:16.180
and instead of trying to
force actual new scenes

30:16.182 --> 30:17.727
for Hooper within the story,

30:18.612 --> 30:21.713
I've got some interesting
ideas on how to use the camera

30:21.716 --> 30:23.432
to give the character more presence.

30:24.018 --> 30:25.624
Technical ideas.

30:26.732 --> 30:27.810
Um...

30:28.289 --> 30:30.720
I was going over the
script last night, and um...

30:31.742 --> 30:33.040
Something occurred to me.

30:33.810 --> 30:35.370
Kyle, do you mind if I make a pitch?

30:36.513 --> 30:37.949
No, no, go right ahead.

30:41.251 --> 30:42.517
It's the final sequence.

30:44.321 --> 30:46.388
<i>Where Clyde sees
the Northern Lights.</i>

30:49.476 --> 30:50.741
<i>And walks into the lake.</i>

30:53.942 --> 30:55.775
<i>But instead of Hooper
sleeping through it...</i>

30:56.878 --> 30:58.343
<i>He wakes up with an instinct.</i>

30:58.680 --> 30:59.683
Clyde?

31:03.585 --> 31:04.492
Clyde!

31:05.587 --> 31:06.686
Clyde, no!

31:10.258 --> 31:11.390
Clyde!

31:11.392 --> 31:12.792
- Hooper, don't!
- No!

31:12.794 --> 31:13.820
Don't!

31:13.820 --> 31:14.853
Listen to me, listen to me.

31:15.392 --> 31:17.653
I didn't think I had
anything to live for either.

31:18.290 --> 31:19.456
Until I met you!

31:24.096 --> 31:25.328
R... Yes, thank you.

31:25.330 --> 31:26.893
I-It's emotional!

31:26.960 --> 31:28.050
Exactly.

31:29.060 --> 31:30.400
It's a hero moment.

31:30.958 --> 31:32.624
- A hero moment!
- Right.

31:32.626 --> 31:34.377
That's exactly what was missing!

31:34.562 --> 31:36.061
Right now, the ending is depressing.

31:36.063 --> 31:38.630
What is she doing in the lake?

31:38.632 --> 31:40.129
- Killing herself?
- Yes!

31:40.434 --> 31:42.734
It's ambiguous. You're
not supposed to know.

31:42.736 --> 31:45.437
I'd rather know. His way I know.

31:45.644 --> 31:48.123
Well, ultimately, it has
to be the director's way.

31:49.143 --> 31:50.455
Kyle, what do you think?

31:51.412 --> 31:54.246
Um, it's definitely interesting.

31:54.583 --> 31:55.647
Yeah.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.304
What do you think?

32:05.446 --> 32:07.672
Who doesn't love a hero moment?

32:09.171 --> 32:10.304
Nice.

32:19.727 --> 32:22.078
Megan! Megan, wait!

32:22.253 --> 32:23.682
Just, excuse me.

32:23.682 --> 32:26.583
This bullshit idea is
going to ruin the movie.

32:26.863 --> 32:28.696
- You need to say something.
- I can't.

32:28.698 --> 32:30.408
You have to, or I will...

32:30.433 --> 32:32.733
Leslie, do not say anything.

32:32.735 --> 32:34.700
Okay? You shouldn't even be here.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.504
Screw that.

32:37.179 --> 32:40.013
He saves her? Really?

32:40.015 --> 32:41.114
You must have burned the midnight oil

32:41.116 --> 32:42.729
for that one, Terence.

32:42.729 --> 32:44.795
Leslie, we can discuss
this at another time.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.898
Sure, how about when the
critics shit all over it?

32:46.900 --> 32:50.535
Look, you can't spend an entire
movie following a character

32:50.537 --> 32:53.738
and then just take away her
ability to choose at the end!

32:53.740 --> 32:55.339
We are adding, we are not taking away,

32:55.341 --> 32:56.674
it's gonna be great.

32:56.676 --> 32:58.209
And frankly, you're
acting a little hysterical.

32:58.211 --> 33:00.178
It's going to be a trope!

33:00.180 --> 33:03.127
You're a misogynistic idiot
and that's why you and Vic here

33:03.175 --> 33:04.366
think it's so great!

33:04.366 --> 33:05.666
I am Vic.

33:05.668 --> 33:07.501
- Yes, you are.
- Leslie, stop!

33:07.503 --> 33:08.961
Please stop.

33:10.441 --> 33:12.049
Fine, I'm leaving.

33:13.377 --> 33:15.435
See you at the People's Choice Awards.

33:16.847 --> 33:19.077
Don't freak out. This is a long game.

33:19.516 --> 33:21.516
I am so sorry.

33:21.518 --> 33:23.451
That was completely inappropriate

33:23.453 --> 33:26.821
and wrong, and she owes
everybody here an apology.

33:27.109 --> 33:28.909
I think we'd all just be happy

33:28.911 --> 33:30.521
if we never had to see her again.

33:32.225 --> 33:34.607
Let's go grab something to drink, shall we?

33:37.319 --> 33:38.567
You ready to go?

33:38.855 --> 33:40.024
Yeah.

33:40.590 --> 33:43.924
Um, yeah, I'm just
gonna go to the bathroom.

33:51.434 --> 33:52.700
Oh, my God.

34:01.177 --> 34:02.209
Megan!

34:02.650 --> 34:04.111
What was going on?

34:04.376 --> 34:05.575
Are you okay?

34:05.577 --> 34:07.310
- My stomach...
- What's the matter?

34:07.312 --> 34:08.612
Are you hurt?

34:10.081 --> 34:11.248
I'm gonna call somebody.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.408
No, no, don't. I'm fine.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.239
Megan, if something's wrong with you,

34:15.242 --> 34:16.851
I just... I want to get you help.

34:18.245 --> 34:19.688
Lisbeth was right.

34:21.748 --> 34:23.954
I'll never be able to separate them.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.487
What should I have Jill make you for lunch?

34:28.907 --> 34:29.965
I'll eat later.

34:29.989 --> 34:31.534
I think I'm gonna go for a run.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.007
I could still have her make you something

34:33.010 --> 34:34.225
for when you get back.

34:34.712 --> 34:35.954
No, thanks. I'm good.

34:36.981 --> 34:39.382
Okay, I'm just gonna start
on the script changes.

34:44.155 --> 34:46.021
I can't do this anymore.

34:47.713 --> 34:49.016
What's that?

34:54.070 --> 34:55.855
Why did you let them ruin it?

34:56.840 --> 34:58.002
Ruin what?

34:58.107 --> 35:01.369
We both fell in love with the story.

35:01.644 --> 35:03.519
And we were gonna tell it together.

35:04.013 --> 35:06.245
Why would you put it
in someone else's hands?

35:07.060 --> 35:09.517
They don't care about quality.

35:09.519 --> 35:11.929
They definitely don't
respect you as a director.

35:11.954 --> 35:13.500
All they care about

35:13.525 --> 35:16.023
is face time and bankability.

35:16.025 --> 35:19.160
And this movie is going to be a disaster,

35:19.453 --> 35:21.370
because you can't think for yourself.

35:21.870 --> 35:22.907
Thank you.

35:23.514 --> 35:25.690
- I've been waiting for that.
- What?

35:25.692 --> 35:27.092
Hooper pulls Clyde out of the lake.

35:27.094 --> 35:28.537
Are you kidding me?

35:30.121 --> 35:31.310
We're not doing that shit.

35:31.335 --> 35:32.462
You don't like it?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.630
Then why didn't you say anything at IHM?

35:34.632 --> 35:36.032
Because I wanted to see
if you would say something.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.166
So you were testing me?

35:37.311 --> 35:38.314
You're an asshole.

35:38.339 --> 35:39.563
No, I'm not the asshole!

35:39.569 --> 35:41.112
I had a reason to say
nothing, what's your excuse?

35:41.137 --> 35:43.137
Who am I to say anything?

35:43.139 --> 35:45.873
You're Kyle West, you're
the center of their universe!

35:45.875 --> 35:48.177
And I cannot do this without you!

35:49.545 --> 35:51.945
Come on, Megan, please. Stop lying, okay?

35:51.947 --> 35:54.757
You walk around like everything
is great, and it is not!

35:55.123 --> 35:57.023
The "I love yous," the sex,

35:57.025 --> 35:59.305
I have no idea what that was last night.

35:59.628 --> 36:01.561
It is all bullshit,
because for some reason,

36:01.563 --> 36:03.277
you cannot tell me the truth!

36:03.432 --> 36:05.031
I sold you out to Terence,

36:05.033 --> 36:06.833
I got you dragged off to the Facility.

36:06.835 --> 36:08.101
And I don't care what good came from that,

36:08.103 --> 36:09.869
if you're not mad at me for that,

36:09.871 --> 36:11.738
then I have no idea who the hell you are.

36:14.776 --> 36:15.909
Please.

36:16.521 --> 36:17.953
Just tell me the truth.

36:19.633 --> 36:21.052
Because if you don't,

36:21.052 --> 36:22.985
I cannot figure out a
way to make it better,

36:22.987 --> 36:24.581
and I need to make it better.

36:29.127 --> 36:30.349
The truth...

36:31.896 --> 36:34.764
Is that I am in a perfect relationship

36:34.766 --> 36:37.500
with a generous, loving,

36:37.502 --> 36:40.536
smart, funny man,

36:40.538 --> 36:42.159
and we're really connected

36:42.184 --> 36:43.984
until something important happens

36:43.986 --> 36:46.953
and his world, and everyone
else in it takes over,

36:46.955 --> 36:50.056
and he turns his back on
me and breaks my heart.

36:51.345 --> 36:53.137
So if I'm not present,

36:53.529 --> 36:55.595
it's because I'm bracing myself

36:55.994 --> 36:57.130
for the next one.

37:00.484 --> 37:02.176
There's not gonna be a next one.

37:03.981 --> 37:05.272
I know you mean that.

37:08.606 --> 37:10.365
That's the whole point, right?

37:11.460 --> 37:13.288
Neither of us can be sure.

37:16.198 --> 37:18.965
And until we can, this is just talk.

37:34.557 --> 37:37.325
Well, well, twice in one week.

37:37.327 --> 37:39.604
Yeah, well, when it
rains, it pours, I guess.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.925
Okay.

37:44.167 --> 37:46.267
Okay, I think we can all
live without that hero moment

37:46.269 --> 37:48.069
if you really don't like it,

37:48.071 --> 37:50.304
but I do think we should
probably write a scene for you.

37:50.759 --> 37:52.726
Yeah, you... you gotta give us something.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.967
I'm gonna give you the movie
that I've been dreaming about.

37:55.197 --> 37:57.531
It doesn't need more Hooper or me.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.533
Look, we hear you, but the
reality of the situation is

37:59.535 --> 38:01.001
that you are the face of this thing, and...

38:01.003 --> 38:03.675
- No. No, I'm not.
- Megan is.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.476
This is your lead actor.

38:06.478 --> 38:08.694
This is your star.

38:09.815 --> 38:12.006
I'm not gonna actually
act in the movie at all.

38:15.081 --> 38:17.095
- Is that a joke?
- No.

38:17.523 --> 38:19.530
No, I'm gonna put my focus
where I think it needs to be,

38:19.698 --> 38:20.724
and that's directing.

38:20.726 --> 38:22.359
Kyle, there are agreements
already in place.

38:22.361 --> 38:24.328
Bankable talent being first and foremost,

38:24.330 --> 38:26.029
we will pull the financing.

38:26.031 --> 38:27.331
Well, if you want to live with regret

38:27.333 --> 38:30.200
for the rest of your
lives, it's your choice.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.341
I've got plenty of my own money.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.611
Here.

38:40.645 --> 38:41.888
Don't worry.

38:42.867 --> 38:44.614
What the hell did you just do?

38:45.188 --> 38:47.088
If I'm in the movie,
it's a Kyle West vehicle,

38:47.090 --> 38:49.945
but if I just direct,
then it becomes ours again.

38:50.093 --> 38:51.493
It needs to be ours.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.027
Everything does.

39:07.688 --> 39:09.539
What's up, guys? I'm Kyle.

39:13.169 --> 39:14.773
It is so great to see you all here.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.912
I have to be honest.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.183
When Terence asked me to
speak today, I said no.

39:20.456 --> 39:22.623
I'm in the middle of a very complicated

39:22.816 --> 39:26.263
and amazing project, and I
just didn't have the time.

39:26.620 --> 39:29.141
But of course, I kept thinking about it.

39:29.978 --> 39:32.037
And actually, what I
was thinking about was us

39:33.186 --> 39:34.678
and what we all have in common.

39:36.156 --> 39:39.190
We all want to be healthy and happy.

39:39.362 --> 39:42.627
Apparently, James is going
to work up at the Facility.

39:43.677 --> 39:45.196
Can he take you there?

39:45.581 --> 39:47.248
If we know where it is, we can expose it.

39:47.250 --> 39:49.350
I have some fences to mend first,

39:49.352 --> 39:50.638
but I'm working on it.

39:50.829 --> 39:53.582
But what makes the IHM community so special

39:54.656 --> 39:56.652
is our desire for something more.

39:59.027 --> 40:00.333
And that's greatness.

40:02.430 --> 40:03.896
It's why we're all here.

40:06.624 --> 40:09.201
We all want to realize the
greatest version of ourselves.

40:11.072 --> 40:13.711
That's when you can
accomplish unimaginable things.

40:15.087 --> 40:18.725
It's what makes the desire
to be great so powerful.

40:19.772 --> 40:21.429
And let's not be afraid to admit it.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.267
Let's all say it together.

40:25.163 --> 40:26.329
I am gonna be great.

40:26.331 --> 40:28.398
I am gonna be great.

40:28.899 --> 40:30.999
I am gonna be great.

40:31.001 --> 40:32.800
I am gonna be great.

40:32.802 --> 40:34.602
Let's put it on its feet, guys! Let's go!

40:34.604 --> 40:35.837
Come on! I am gonna be great!

40:35.839 --> 40:37.472
I am gonna be great!

40:37.474 --> 40:38.973
I am gonna be great!

40:38.975 --> 40:40.642
I am gonna be great!

40:40.644 --> 40:43.478
One last time, real
big, I am gonna be great!

40:43.480 --> 40:45.513
I am gonna be great!

40:45.515 --> 40:47.081
Yes, you are!

40:50.287 --> 40:51.653
You're smiling.

40:52.455 --> 40:53.890
Today I am.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.890
Tomorrow will probably be a
completely different story.

40:56.892 --> 40:58.741
You will be great!

41:00.426 --> 41:02.480
Thank you very much.

41:04.263 --> 41:06.684

41:07.467 --> 41:10.415

41:10.440 --> 41:11.561
_

41:31.986 --> 41:33.619
A year was hard enough,

41:33.621 --> 41:35.817
these last two days have
just been killing me.

41:36.222 --> 41:39.163
I will make up for it,
every minute we've waited.

41:39.402 --> 41:40.457
I promise.

42:58.649 --> 43:01.101
