<i>l'm gonna put on my old blue jean</i> s

00:05.960 --> 00:09.430
<i>Gonna walk out of here into the stree</i> t

00:09.480 --> 00:13.790
<i>Would you put up resistance</i> ?
<i>Would it make a difference</i> ?

00:13.840 --> 00:18.630
<i>Would you know the real me</i> ?
<i>Me in my old blue jean</i> s

00:23.520 --> 00:27.300
Hannah, you rock!
l can't believe you did three encores!

00:27.840 --> 00:30.350
l can't believe you did three encores.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.310
You know we have a science project
due Monday.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.230
What is wrong with you?

00:34.800 --> 00:37.830
Okay. Let's leave
this boring rock star life behind

00:37.880 --> 00:41.710
and get back to the glamorous world
of earthworm larvae.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.350
You decent, girl?
l got your squeaky little friend out here.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.110
l told you, it's a nasal condition.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.510
And, Hannah, l brought someone
who wants to meet you.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.830
No way. We're already late,

00:54.880 --> 00:57.230
and l promised our larvae
we'd be home by 1 0:00.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.750
Okay, fine, l'll get rid of whoever it is...

00:58.800 --> 01:00.750
Hey, l'm Jesse.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.870
Oh, my gosh. lt's Jesse McCartney.
l love you!

01:10.080 --> 01:12.590
l mean, big fan, big fan.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.790
Listen, tonight, l am the fan.
You did a great job.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.270
And you are?

01:20.200 --> 01:22.350
Nice to meet you, ''Eep.''

01:23.760 --> 01:25.270
Listen, Hannah,
a bunch of my friends and l,

01:25.320 --> 01:27.510
we're going to the Dragon Room.
Wanna come?

01:27.560 --> 01:28.590
-Yes.
-No.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.700
-No?
-Yes.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.190
Excuse us.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.480
-What are you doing?
-Our science project.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.710
Right. Okay, l've got the fix.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.470
You do all the work,
and l'll go out with Jesse. Toodles.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.740
l got a better idea.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.390
You give me the Hannah wig,
and l'll go out with Jesse. Toodles.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.740
l don't think he speaks...

01:49.640 --> 01:51.910
Listen, ladies,
if now's not a good night,

01:51.960 --> 01:53.350
why don't we do it tomorrow?

01:53.400 --> 01:55.110
-That would be absolutely...
-Math test.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.030
-...impossible. How about Tuesday...
-Yearbook committee.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.990
-...of next week?
-Homecoming float.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.710
Which l just realised is no good, either.
Busy, busy bee. Yep, that's me.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.190
Why don't l just text you?

02:05.240 --> 02:09.350
Getting rejected in person is enough.
l don't need it in writing. Thanks.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.110
This stinks.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.670
Of course they stink.
They live in their own poop.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.950
Not the worms. My life.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.300
l cannot believe
l gave up Jesse McCartney

02:26.360 --> 02:28.430
for a slimy piece of fish bait.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.590
She didn't really mean that, Ernie.
She loves you.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.790
lf only l could've told Jesse the truth.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.220
He would've understood
about school stuff,

02:37.280 --> 02:41.150
but then l'd blow the secret.
This double life is so hard.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.550
Look, a shooting star.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.230
l wish for an A on the project.
What do you wish for?

02:50.560 --> 02:54.750
Man, l wish...
l wish there was no secret,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.510
l was just Hannah Montana all the time.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.990
Sure would make life
a whole lot easier.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.750
Your wish came true, girl.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.420
You didn't want to be Miley.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.750
Well, now, you're all Hannah,
all the time.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.990
What are you talking about?

04:44.040 --> 04:46.270
You wished for one life and you got it.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.350
ln this world,
Miley Stewart never existed.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.390
v ery funny, Roxy.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.150
l'm not Roxy. l'm an angel.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.430
l'm only taking the shape of Roxy
to make you more comfortable,

04:58.480 --> 05:00.350
and l'm loving it.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.590
Okay.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.070
How about you just wait here

05:06.120 --> 05:12.110
while l go get some very nice men
with a very big net?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.910
You don't believe me?

05:14.960 --> 05:18.070
Well, if l wasn't an angel,
could l do this?

05:21.160 --> 05:24.470
Check out my fly kicks,
and l do mean fly kicks.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.550
No, no, no, no, no.
This cannot be happening.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.430
lt's already happened.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.470
You wished upon a star, and now
Hannah Montana is who you are.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.550
-Wow.
-Nice crib, huh?

05:43.600 --> 05:47.380
Look at this place! lt is so rock-star.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.870
l mean, the twinkly lights,
the leather couches,

05:51.920 --> 05:54.070
and look at that awesome chandelier.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.110
-Madonna has one just like it.
-Not any more.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.150
l love this!

06:00.560 --> 06:02.350
You ain't seen nothing yet.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.190
Your favourite breakfast cake,
<i>mademoisell</i> e Montana.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.420
-Triple Dutch chocolate?
-With a fudge ripple middle.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.030
l really love this.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.150
l will put it next to the hot tub

06:16.200 --> 06:19.070
so that you can chill out
while you pig out.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.790
l speak French.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.630
You have a whole different life.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.270
You lived in France,
you own polo ponies,

06:30.320 --> 06:32.110
and you have a black belt in jujitsu,

06:32.160 --> 06:36.710
which came in handy when you fought
that tiger on <i>circus with the Stars</i>.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.270
l fought a tiger? l am so cool.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.510
Good morning, Hannah.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.420
Mr Corelli. What are you doing here?

06:47.480 --> 06:50.350
Home school teacher.
Hannah can't go to public school.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.710
Yeah, l dropped by early
to grab a little chow.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.390
You know how much
l love Pierre's <i>omelette du fromage</i>.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.470
By the way,
that's French for ''cheese omelette.''

07:00.520 --> 07:01.910
l know!

07:02.800 --> 07:06.190
Hey, Hannah,
do you have that history report for me?

07:06.240 --> 07:08.270
History report. Right, well...

07:08.320 --> 07:12.270
Hey, no excuses, young lady.
lf you do not have that report...

07:13.120 --> 07:14.950
Who cares?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.990
lt's home schooling <i>รก l</i> a Corelli.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.390
By the way,
loving the Team Montana jacket.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.270
Bling, bling, bling.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.950
Wore it to the salon yesterday,
got a free back wax.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.590
So, l don't have to worry
about my assignments?

07:33.640 --> 07:35.230
You don't have to worry
about anything.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.790
You are Hannah Montana.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.430
And l am loving it.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.180
Yeah, life is pretty sweet

07:45.240 --> 07:48.150
when you don't have to deal
with all that Miley stuff.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.710
You got that right. No math test,
no stinky earthworms and...

07:51.760 --> 07:54.470
And more time to spend with your man.

07:55.280 --> 07:59.910
-l got a man?
-Not just a man, but the man.

08:03.960 --> 08:08.390
<i>Santa Luci</i> a

08:09.080 --> 08:13.070
<i>Oh, mamma mi</i> a

08:13.400 --> 08:16.470
The perfect night with the perfect girl.

08:16.520 --> 08:21.270
<i>Santa Luci</i> a

08:21.760 --> 08:23.030
l'd sing to you myself,

08:23.080 --> 08:26.310
but l need these lips
for something else.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.430
You're so cute when you say ''Eep.''

08:33.760 --> 08:37.350
Sorry, sugar lips,
but my wings are getting all soggy.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.590
You couldn't have given me
one more minute?

08:50.120 --> 08:53.870
Sorry, but the top of the gondola?
Romantic.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.870
Bottom? Nasty.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.950
l can't believe it.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.590
All these years, l was so paranoid
about my secret getting out,

09:00.640 --> 09:03.430
but, boy, was l wrong!
This life is perfect.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.590
Hannah-kins!

09:07.600 --> 09:10.350
How's my favourite little rock star?

09:11.520 --> 09:15.270
-Great. How's my favourite little...
-Stepmom.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.830
Step... What?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.710
Candice was your first
home school teacher.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.190
Now she's my mom?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.950
That must've been
some parent-teacher conference.

09:26.120 --> 09:32.190
Hey, hey, hey, darling.
You missed some gnarly boarding.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.390
-Gnarly boarding?
-Totally.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.220
Next time we go to Switzerland,
you so gotta come with us.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.270
-lt was off the hook.
-Radical.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.710
But l'm back now, baby.
Give me a big hug.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.110
Have you been working out?

09:50.160 --> 09:54.910
l so gotta stay in shape
to keep up with this little kitten.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.590
Stop it!

10:02.600 --> 10:06.220
l got some yackety-yak coming back.
How about you?

10:06.960 --> 10:10.150
Little bit. But you know what?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.430
My dad's happy,
and that's all that matters, right?

10:12.480 --> 10:13.590
That's the spirit.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.470
Don't let a little bump in the road
get you down.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.950
Speaking of little bumps,
where's Jackson?

10:18.320 --> 10:19.910
He doesn't live here any more.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.990
Sometimes this teleporting stuff
ain't easy.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.420
Oh, no, l dinged a wing.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.030
l got you!

10:42.520 --> 10:44.070
Jackson?

10:44.120 --> 10:47.790
Yee, doggies, a quarter!
l'm eating good tonight.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.430
-What happened to him?
-Hannah Montana.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.910
He got tired of people pretending
to be his friends just to get to you,

10:54.960 --> 10:57.710
so he dropped out
and became a hermit.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.670
A stinky hermit.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.990
Hey, what are you looking at? Get! Get!

11:03.040 --> 11:04.470
What happened to his voice?

11:04.520 --> 11:06.870
Nothing. He just does that
to scare people away.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.150
Jackson.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.310
Sweet nuggets! l hit the mother lode!

11:16.640 --> 11:18.510
lt's just the load.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.200
Jackson, was being my brother
really that bad?

11:22.240 --> 11:25.990
Yep! Now, get! l got my own life now.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.590
And me
and my dolphin brothers and sisters

11:27.640 --> 11:30.590
don't care about no Hanny Montanny.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.740
Except for Dave. He loves you.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.470
Forget it, Dave!
You want an autograph,

11:37.520 --> 11:39.980
you come up here
and you ask her yourself!

11:41.880 --> 11:45.550
Wow. When he dropped out,
he must've landed on his head.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.710
<i>Yo yo y</i> o

11:47.760 --> 11:52.030

<i>Just slide me a fiv</i> e

11:55.800 --> 11:59.270
l cannot believe Oliver's selling peeks
into my house.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.150
lt's like he's turned into a...

12:02.240 --> 12:04.700
A stretched-out version of that?

12:04.760 --> 12:09.510
-How we doing today, Twice My Size?
-Making bacon, Mini Me.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.830
And we ain't faking. Time to do

12:11.880 --> 12:13.750
-a little shaking.
-A little shaking.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.910
All of this happened because...

12:17.960 --> 12:20.630
Because l was never Miley,
l never went to regular school,

12:20.680 --> 12:22.070
and so l never met Oliver.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.590
l got it.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.430
Oh, no. Angel, what happened to Lilly?

12:29.440 --> 12:30.870
Okay, everyone.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.030
-Prepare to be jealous.
-Because we look...

12:34.080 --> 12:35.990
-Fabulous!
-Fabulous!

12:38.960 --> 12:41.150
No!

12:41.640 --> 12:43.190
You've done it now.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.710
-lt's Hannah Montana!
-Angel, help!

12:46.760 --> 12:48.110
Freeze!

12:50.560 --> 12:53.470
Okay, you know what?
l don't want this life any more.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.060
l want to be Miley again.
l want my friends back.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.670
Too late for that.
Nobody ever gets a second wish.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.190
Angel say what?

13:04.240 --> 13:06.750
This is your life, Hannah.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.580
Angel, there's got to be a way
to get my old life back.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.070
l told you, superstar.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.590
Only one wish per customer.
No refunds or exchanges.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.070
Hey, babe.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.350
You ready for our picnic on Papui?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.110
What in the world is Papui?

13:38.680 --> 13:40.190
The island l bought you.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.590
Oh, my gosh.
Jesse McCartney bought me an island.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.750
-l'm sorry, Jesse. l can't.
-Why not?

13:51.160 --> 13:54.780
l'm sort of dealing
with something right now, so...

13:54.840 --> 13:59.030
You're so cute when you're dealing
with something right now.

13:59.080 --> 14:03.190
That's sweet, Jesse,
but l think l need to be alone.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.910
You're so cute
when you need to be alone.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.830
-Jesse.
-You're so cute when you say ''Jesse.''

14:06.880 --> 14:07.940
Get out.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.430
You're so cute
when you're kicking me out.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.870
l'm serious.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.390
Still so cute.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.790
Angel, there has got to be
some kind of loophole.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.070
Well, you could... No.
Well, how about if you...

14:24.560 --> 14:27.190
How about... Girl, l got nothing.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.520
Angel, l want my family back,
l want my friends back,

14:30.560 --> 14:34.470
and Miley Stewart does not take ''no''
for an answer.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.980
That's because
Miley Stewart doesn't exist.

14:37.040 --> 14:41.150
Not yet, but you'd be surprised
what this girl can do with a wig.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.980
<i>Get your genuin</i> e

-Respect.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.910
l mean, where'd she find that outfit?
Like, Ugly-R-Us?

15:14.960 --> 15:16.870
More like Ugly-R-Her.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.030
-We are so funny.
-And pretty.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.710
l love us.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.150
-Time to hydrate.
-Time to hydrate.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.030
-Hi.
-Yeah, whatever.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.750
Three bottled waters with lime, pronto.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.870
Anyway, l'm Miley, and l'm new here,

15:39.920 --> 15:43.190
and l was just wondering,
do you want to be friends?

15:43.760 --> 15:48.350
Okay, first, ''Miley,'' stupid name.
B, l've already got friends.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.990
And, <i>cuatro</i>, why don't you go back
to the trailer park,

15:52.040 --> 15:54.150
unhitch and drive away?

15:54.880 --> 15:59.270
No, no, no.
l can't drive, but l do skateboard.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.030
Do you skateboard?

16:01.320 --> 16:05.790
As if! lt's stupid, it's sweaty,
and, hello, who wants helmet hair?

16:07.160 --> 16:12.790
You do. You used to love helmet hair
and scabby knees and elbow pad rash.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.510
-Doesn't that sound like fun?
-l took a pretty girl's karate class.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.110
What happened to you?
You're not like this.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.620
How can you be friends
with Amber and Ashley?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.190
Come on, Lilly. You're better than that.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.830
Okay, how do you know my name?

16:28.880 --> 16:32.270
Wait, everybody knows my name
because l'm popular.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.430
Well, does everybody know

16:34.480 --> 16:37.790
that you have a birthmark
shaped like a poodle on your butt?

16:38.280 --> 16:42.950
-How do you know that?
-Because l'm your best friend.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.580
And l know somewhere
deep down inside of you,

16:45.640 --> 16:48.390
our friendship is still there.
Come on, look at me.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.270
Really, really look at me.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.990
Come on, Lilly. Don't you know me?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.230
Oh, my gosh.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.710
Yes! l knew you'd be able to
see the real me.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.470
Of course l can.
The blond hair's coming out of the wig.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.550
You're Hannah Montana!

17:07.839 --> 17:08.900
Look, everybody!

17:08.960 --> 17:12.069
Hannah Montana's back,
and she knows what's on my butt!

17:13.560 --> 17:16.190
l can't believe l just said that out loud!

17:16.960 --> 17:18.790
Over here, Hannah. Smile.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.380
Come on, baby.
Give me a little something something.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.110
You can't believe what he bought me.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.340
Marrying that dumb hillbilly
was the smartest thing l ever did.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.790
Hey, darling, you okay?
You been up here for hours.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.620
No.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.670
Oh, boy, back ways round.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.830
This may be more than
my <i>loc</i> o hot cocoa can cure.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.150
You still make crazy <i>loc</i> o hot cocoa?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.390
Of course l do.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.900
Why would you even ask
a silly question like that?

18:02.960 --> 18:05.230
Because everything's wrong.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.500
Lilly and Oliver
aren't my friends any more.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.910
-Who?
-See?

18:11.160 --> 18:15.310
-And Jackson moved out.
-No, no, no. Now, that was his choice.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.990
Yeah, but it wouldn't
have been his choice

18:17.040 --> 18:20.950
if l wouldn't have made that stupid wish
and changed everything.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.270
What wish?

18:23.320 --> 18:26.310
Bud, you're starting to sound
more <i>loc</i> o than the cocoa.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.550
Don't you ''bud'' me.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.350
You're the one that married
a blood-sucking leech

18:30.400 --> 18:31.910
that doesn't even love you.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.070
So that's what this is all about.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.510
You know your stepmama warned me

18:37.560 --> 18:39.470
you might end up resenting her
a little bit.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.230
She is so smart about teenage girls.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.510
That's 'cause last year she was one.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.830
Now, you hold on there, young lady.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.950
l understand you being upset,

18:51.000 --> 18:56.470
but one thing that will never change
is you, me and our <i>loc</i> o hot cocoa.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.270
There you are. Hey, l was wondering...

19:01.040 --> 19:03.830
Snap, is that hot chocolate?

19:04.480 --> 19:06.780
Get it out! Get it out!
l'm horribly allergic.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.070
l get massive, massive headaches.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.750
And you know what l am like
when l get my headaches.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.710
Totally. <i>Adiรณs, loc</i> o cocoa.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.180
Daddy, what about our special drink?

19:18.240 --> 19:22.070
Just drink some tea.
What's the big diff, whiny little baby?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.670
Robby!
Candy needs a shopping spree

19:24.720 --> 19:26.830
to make her head feel better!

19:36.560 --> 19:40.100
<i>You get the best of one worl</i> d

19:40.560 --> 19:41.620
Shut it.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.190
<i>chill it out, take it slo</i> w
<i>Then you rock out the sho</i> w

19:44.240 --> 19:47.750
<i>You get the best of one worl</i> d

19:49.200 --> 19:53.790
Miley, why did you ever make
that stupid wish? l hate my life.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.790
l ain't so crazy about it, either.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.030
Jackson, you came back.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.270
Well, you're darn tooting.

20:03.160 --> 20:07.270
l may be a grumpy hermit,
but l still need my reality Tv.

20:07.560 --> 20:10.070
Now, quiet!
Chauntel's about ready to eat a bug.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.110
Jackson, Jackson. lt's just us.
You don't have to do the voice.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.750
What voice?

20:16.760 --> 20:18.750
Right, sometimes l forget.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.870
Jackson, you know what?

20:20.920 --> 20:24.510
l don't even care about the voice.
l'm just so happy you came back.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.780
Welcome home.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.710
Didn't you hear me? l'm not staying.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.910
But, Jackson, you have to.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.710
l want at least some of my old life back.

20:33.760 --> 20:38.880
l mean, you and l weren't perfect.
We fought, but we loved each other,

20:39.560 --> 20:42.630
and Dad loved us,
and there was no evil stepmom,

20:42.680 --> 20:45.030
and l had great friends,

20:45.080 --> 20:48.310
and it was all because the world
didn't know l was Hannah Montana.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.830
A world that didn't know
you were Hannah Montana?

20:52.520 --> 20:54.790
Boy, l'd wish for that any day.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.790
Angel! Angel, a shooting star!
Right when he wished.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.750
Come on,
that's got to count for something.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.310
Please?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.870
Oh, man. l'm stuck like this forever.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.710
Congratulations.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.990
What? She found a loophole!

21:23.920 --> 21:26.950
You have yourself
a wonderful life, Miley.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.030
Look, a shooting star.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.270
l wish for an A on the project.
What do you wish for?

21:40.320 --> 21:44.590
l don't wish for anything.
l love my life exactly the way it is.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.430
Fresh.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.310
