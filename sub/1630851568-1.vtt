Someone clearly dragged the body
out of the river from the pictures.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.252
How come? Any evidence?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.338
The soaked clothes and hair.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.298
Grass fallen in the direction of the body.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.926
Oh, Mr. Profiler,
you really have a knack for this.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.684
Who would drag the body
all the way to the bike path?

01:43.478 --> 01:44.312
The perpetrator.

01:44.896 --> 01:45.814
Why would he do that?

01:45.897 --> 01:48.525
The biggest question in this case is…

02:06.459 --> 02:09.003
R-RATED

02:13.466 --> 02:15.468
When are you gonna pay me my 720,000 won?

02:16.678 --> 02:18.012
Come later in the evening.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.181
So you can tell me to come back tomorrow?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.228
By the way,
why aren't you bringing me the new books?

02:26.855 --> 02:29.816
You need to pay me
for me to bring those to you!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.987
Damn it!

02:34.571 --> 02:36.656
You have to pay me later today!

02:36.739 --> 02:38.324
I just put her to sleep.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.955
I'm changing it now.
Stop crying now, will you?

02:49.752 --> 02:52.172
No way. You just went.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.176
Yes, sleep tight until mommy comes.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.303
You can do it, yes.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.604
Sorry. Daddy must've gone mad.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.523
I promise I'll sit quietly from now.
Sorry, Hong-ji.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.042
Look at my baby playing like an angel.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.919
You aren't even crying.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.795
We need to talk.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.256
Don't even get started
about me quitting my job.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.800
My sales keep dropping.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.053
She poops and cries all day.
Customers hate it.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.056
Like you had any sales to begin with.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.308
It's not like I want to work.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.894
We need money
to send Geon-wu to preschool next year.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.938
Stop making me mad and give me the money.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.232
It's Monday. I need our living expenses.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.859
Oh, yeah. I paid for the new books today.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.071
-I forgot.
-What?

03:58.154 --> 04:00.156
The card payments are due tomorrow.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.159
-Your paycheck?
-I've worked for less than two weeks now.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.457
How many new books were there? This is it?

04:11.292 --> 04:12.669
Show me everything you got today.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.588
-Why?
-Let's be real.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.341
You've been closing the store
to go to the police station, right?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.593
What are you talking about?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.262
Good, then bring them to me.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.305
Well?

04:25.056 --> 04:25.932
Let me see them.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.020
Look, she's crying! Take her!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.106
-What about the money?
-Pay with another credit card.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.274
I'll take care of it later.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.109
You said that about loan accounts too.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.402
She's crying. Come on!

04:37.485 --> 04:39.320
Hurry. She's crying!

04:42.198 --> 04:44.200
Hurry. Here.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.119
Hurry now.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.537
Don't cry now.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.665
There, there. Don't cry!

Detective Kang was looking for you.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.191
We have a Kang on our team?

05:17.275 --> 05:21.195
Sure we do. The mentalist
who can solve a crime at a glance.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.489
There he is.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.575
Hey, Jun!

05:27.744 --> 05:30.705
You've been here for 15 days
and you still don't know your seniors?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.290
Did you get a case?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.294
Come with me, bastard.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.671
-Get in here.
-It hurts.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.881
What's it this time?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.966
Rape? Larceny?

05:42.508 --> 05:46.512
Detective, do you put your ex's house
on fire when you break up with her?

05:46.596 --> 05:47.722
Then why were you there?

05:47.805 --> 05:49.432
I was on my way back from the sauna.

SERGEANT NOH TAE-SU

05:50.475 --> 05:52.226

05:52.310 --> 05:54.479
Around 12:30 p.m.
I stayed for about an hour.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.940
When was the fire?

05:59.484 --> 06:00.735
Lies.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.528
Then how come no one remembers you?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.155
Seriously.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.532
What are you--

06:07.325 --> 06:13.456
-I'll be quiet.
-Go, Dae-man, please.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.669
You skipped work due to illness.
Where are you sick?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.963
-This is killing me.
-Where are you sick?

06:21.047 --> 06:24.592
As I'm sure you know,
Ji-won got married at 1 p.m. today.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.471
I just wanted to get away for the day.
I met Ji-won at work.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.681
What a strange coincidence.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.810
An old lover gets married.
Her house burns on fire the same day.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.938
Her ex just happens to be
watching it burn at that very moment.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.316
When I was passing by her place,
the fire truck was already there.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.907
Hi, Mom.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.743
I'm fine. Don't worry.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.370
It's not a big deal.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.747
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.583
-Annoying like a blowfly.
-I'll call you back.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.043
Empty your pockets.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.002
Now!

07:06.050 --> 07:07.552
He's not the perp.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.928
Let him go. He's not it.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.348
-Fucking…
-Go, please!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.183
I'm going! Let me just say one thing!

07:14.267 --> 07:16.269
-Let me--
-Dae-man, please!

07:16.352 --> 07:18.896
Let me go. He's not the perp.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.981
Hey.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.316
Say what you gotta say and leave.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.488
First of all,
this guy was definitely at the sauna.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.033
His watch was in his pocket.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.786
Sure proof
that he just got out of the sauna.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.079
Excellent. Are we good?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.038
Go.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.459
-One more thing!
-Seriously!

07:41.210 --> 07:42.170
The phone rang earlier.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.381
If he was the perp,
he'd have it on vibrate or silent mode.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.510
-Exactly!
-Not like he'd want people know he did it.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.180
Get going.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.351
-Go.
-Go.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.770
I'm sorry.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.232
Hey Jun-su, have you seen his shoes?

08:04.775 --> 08:06.777
-Have you seen it?
-Go, you fucker!

08:06.861 --> 08:09.363
You should look.
An arsonist wearing flip-flops?

08:09.447 --> 08:12.325
-Go, please!
-Arson isn't exactly a leisurely walk!

08:12.408 --> 08:13.451
Wait!

08:13.534 --> 08:18.122
Why didn't he run when police arrived?
Afraid his flip-flops would come off?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.791
You got the wrong guy!

08:20.875 --> 08:22.585
Go look at him! See?

08:23.252 --> 08:24.921
It's not even a big deal!

08:25.004 --> 08:26.255
Put it down, bastard.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
Is this your pal's playground?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.094
I'm sorry, sir.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.096
Tell him once and for all.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.932
If I see him here again

08:36.682 --> 08:38.726
I'm making him a suspect
for a homicide cold case.

08:39.936 --> 08:40.811
Yes, sir.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.896
Crazy bastards.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.774
And let that guy loose.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.194
What? Man-Eating Shark
of the Wide-Area Investigation Squad?

08:49.070 --> 08:50.029
I'm not kidding.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.199
You won't find a thug
that's not scared of him.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.742
Then what's he doing here?

08:54.825 --> 08:57.495
The legendary man-eating shark
of the Wide-Area Investigation Squad?

08:58.079 --> 09:01.123
Officially, when he was arresting
the Maseongi gang of Guro

09:01.207 --> 09:04.168
he killed three of the gang members
and got demoted for it.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.212
What? He killed three?

09:06.295 --> 09:08.047
With his bare hands, too.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.717
The guy's too rigid and uncontrollable.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.554
Rumor has it they decided to oust him
with the killings as the excuse.

09:15.054 --> 09:19.684
Police University grads are like that.
You're either in or you're out.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.769
Police University grad…

09:23.354 --> 09:24.981
I thought he was a headstrong smug.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.692
You bastard. He could really mess you up.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.402
Stop it.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.196
He does not look
like a Police University grad.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.699
He doesn't look like
he went to school at all.

09:36.951 --> 09:37.827
Jun-su.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.582
I'm so grateful for you.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.875
This bastard. Here he goes again.

09:46.877 --> 09:51.966
I really want to break my two legs.

I told you to stay still.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.194

Hi, what's up?

10:53.694 --> 10:54.528
Now?

10:55.446 --> 10:56.280
Okay.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.993
Is something going on
with you and Yong-gyu?

11:01.494 --> 11:02.828
Why's he calling me?

11:02.912 --> 11:03.913
What did he say?

11:03.996 --> 11:07.291
He wants me to come over
to his store for a drink.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.629
Wanna go?

11:15.299 --> 11:16.509
I've got an emergency.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.013
This is the life of a detective.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.307
It's not all fun and rosy like you think.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.727
Want me to come with?

11:26.811 --> 11:27.812
Shut up.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.814
Tell Yong-gyu I said hi.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.534
Are you really
going to hide it from Yong-gyu?

11:41.617 --> 11:42.702
That's the plan.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.621
Until we get divorced.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.464
Hong-ji's up.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.425

12:19.321 --> 12:20.406

12:21.449 --> 12:24.076
Yong-gyu, I'm leaving first.
Your baby's up.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.125
The baby's crying! Hey!

12:41.051 --> 12:41.886
Yong-gyu!

12:43.679 --> 12:44.805
Seo-yeong.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.272

12:57.943 --> 12:58.778

13:02.907 --> 13:04.074
Seo-yeong.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.003
Seo-yeong.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.765
-Detective Shin.
-Yup.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.934
Come this way.

13:30.017 --> 13:30.893
Watch your feet.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.564
-Did you check the security office?
-Yes.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.945
-Any missing possessions?
-Didn't you learn from Police Academy?

13:41.028 --> 13:43.948
-I'm sorry, sir.
-And go to the management office…

13:46.909 --> 13:49.745
-Go get it from them--
-What's the fuss?

13:50.371 --> 13:52.665
Eyes wide open, mouth shut.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.750
Keep your useless hands in the pockets.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.297
Estimated time of death?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.675
11:22:49 p.m. last night.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.095
We'll need an autopsy to be sure,
but that sounds about right.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.430
Name, Han Seo-yeong. Age, 33. Married.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.765
She was a realtor.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.685
She had a kid just past one
with her husband.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.271
Did you get the nearby CCTVs?

14:15.813 --> 14:19.275
We, Team 1, got the CCTV.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.195
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Useless bastard.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.281
-Who reported it?
-Right.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.658
The husband called at 7:30 a.m.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.243
But she died last night.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.330
I'm not sure. He woke up and she was dead.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.086
It's strange. No footprint or fingerprint.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.338
I would suspect an acquaintance.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.550
No sign of hesitation
for murder burglary case.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.139
Our perp's got humor.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.808
Righty held the knife with his left hand.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.102
How do you…

14:55.185 --> 14:57.187
A typical execution wound.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.648
Confirmation stab.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.192
You're right. This laceration
came from different direction.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.029
Because he used his right hand
to stab it down.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.864
Why?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.534
How could you ask such a stupid question?

15:13.746 --> 15:14.663
Who brought him?

15:15.497 --> 15:17.499
-Sorry, sir.
-These HR bastards!

15:17.583 --> 15:19.293
The perp is a right-handed acquaintance.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.797
With an intent to frame someone
who is left-handed.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.507
Thank goodness somebody has a brain.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.179
Sorry, he was here before we arrived.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.639
With the victim's husband.h

15:34.433 --> 15:35.935
Is he a righty or a lefty?

15:36.018 --> 15:36.852
Excuse me?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.063
I hear you're like brothers
with the victim's husband.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.607
-Are you suspecting the husband?
-I'm the one questioning.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.275
He's right handed.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.319
Do you know the first rule of homicide?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.947
When a wife dies,
the killer is the husband.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.618
Yong-gyu.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.662
This is just part of the process.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.915
-Yesterday--
-What time did you get home last night?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.005
I'm not sure exactly.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.678
Probably 3 or 4 a.m.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.054
What were you doing where?

16:13.597 --> 16:14.556
I was drinking.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.557
With who?

16:15.641 --> 16:16.558
Me.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.644
I drank with him.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.813
-Get out.
-I drank with him!

16:20.896 --> 16:22.815
-Stop it and leave!
-He drank with me!

16:22.898 --> 16:24.692
Well, this is interesting.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.988
Tell me everything you remember.

16:30.948 --> 16:31.907
Let's see.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.703
We left the gamjatang place

16:36.829 --> 16:37.663
and then

16:39.248 --> 16:41.375
and then I don't remember.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.961
You blacked out, too?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.590
Bullshit.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.175
Did you two already talk?

16:51.677 --> 16:52.761
Talk about what!

16:53.595 --> 16:55.264
Anyone you suspect?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.349
Had a beef with anyone?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.518
I'm not sure.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.690
Seriously, what's wrong with that dude?

17:06.734 --> 17:07.735
I'm sorry.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.281
Please.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.491
Jun-su.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.457
I'll catch the perp.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.177
How scary.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.597
Can't believe
such a thing could happen near us.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.141
And my husband as one of the suspects.

17:42.144 --> 17:42.978
Oh, right.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.730
How dare you stay out all night.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.275
Why were you at their place anyway?
Were you two that close?

17:48.358 --> 17:49.902
Be quiet for a second.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.411
Sorry but can you go buy some formula?

18:00.871 --> 18:02.164
Aren't you feeding her now?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.333
It's not coming out well.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.459
Do it better.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.170
Just go get some now!

18:16.595 --> 18:18.138
Now I get it.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.351
Why men like women with big breasts.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.895
Dad, where are you going?

18:28.398 --> 18:29.566
Seriously?

18:37.950 --> 18:38.992
Never seen them.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.037
I just talked to Dae-man.
He remembers bits from yesterday.

18:42.121 --> 18:42.996
That's fine.

18:43.080 --> 18:43.914
Take this.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.042
Do you really not remember?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.253
Most of my customers are two men.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.462
Take a good look.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.005
I don't know.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.259
Remember. When a wife is killed,
the killer is her husband.

18:57.845 --> 19:01.640
Why can't you remember?
I was sitting right here yesterday.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.183
Seriously, man.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.228
Take a good look at my face.
Open your eyes!

19:09.356 --> 19:10.649
One grilled eel, please!

19:11.150 --> 19:12.025
Oh yeah, eel!

19:12.109 --> 19:13.277
Here's your grilled eel.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.947
You wasted your 20,000 won.

19:18.115 --> 19:18.949
Damn it.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.200
What a waste.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.163
What are you saying? I didn't even get up.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.289
I was sitting right here.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.458
-The asshole from yesterday!
-Yeah, that's me!

19:28.542 --> 19:29.543
Hey.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.379
Tell the truth
unless you want to be an accomplice.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.965
-Accomplice?
-Was he really here yesterday?

19:35.048 --> 19:36.592
-What are you trying to do?
-What time?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.135
Seriously?

19:38.802 --> 19:44.766
Well, the eel fell around 11 p.m.
so he got here before then.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.518
When did he leave…

19:46.602 --> 19:50.063
I change shifts with my wife at 1 a.m.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.899
So, I'm not sure when he left.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.484
Tall lady! North Face jacket.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.654
North Face! Tall lady!

19:57.738 --> 19:58.989
My wife is tall.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.581
Shit.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.458
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.046
There's something odd about this watch.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.088
Like what?

20:15.172 --> 20:17.382
Her wrist didn't have any blood

20:17.966 --> 20:20.844
so how's there blood
on the back of the watch?

20:21.637 --> 20:23.347
Do you have the estimated time of death?

20:23.430 --> 20:24.389
Around 11:20 p.m.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.725
Error range of 5 minutes from this watch.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.394
Either the perp took off the watch.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.774
Or the Crime Scene Unit
got it on there by mistake.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.152
Why would the perp undo the watch
and put it back on?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.070
Right?

20:38.779 --> 20:40.614
These CSU idiots.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.074
Good work.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.580
Three total.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.501
That's right. 300 won per book so…

20:55.212 --> 20:57.047
Come again next time, sir.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.174
You've got talent, Geon-wu.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.343
Here's your allowance.

21:02.052 --> 21:02.970
Take care of the store.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.643
-What do you say when mom calls?
-Dad's in the bathroom.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.604
-And then?
-I call your cell phone.

21:13.897 --> 21:14.731
Perfect.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.660
He's hanging in there, all right.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.413
Demoted to serve
under his Police University junior.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.164
He should know better than to stay.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.167
Is he stupid or gutless?

21:34.251 --> 21:35.961
His youngest just entered preschool.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.004
Twins.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.590
Yikes. How many years till college then?

21:40.674 --> 21:42.676
You've got more than ten years with him.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.554
Good for him.
He gets to rely on his senior.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.763
Isn't that right?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.473
Damn it.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.560
Do bring him
to the managers meeting later!

21:52.686 --> 21:54.271
We traced the victim's account.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.773
150 million won
withdrawn in cash five days ago.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.025
Fishy, right?

21:58.525 --> 21:59.651
Trace that money.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.652
Yes, sir.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.154
Hey, Detective Noh.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.157
Go around schools
and look for adulterated foods.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.995
What? You got a problem?

22:13.749 --> 22:17.544
Homicide team 3 placed last
in the rooting out four evils campaign.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.006
Put less effort into glaring
and start working.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.215
Got it?

22:22.299 --> 22:23.342
Move!

22:30.098 --> 22:30.932
Jun-su.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.476
Jun!

22:37.147 --> 22:38.023
You have a lead.

22:39.024 --> 22:39.858
Right?

22:39.941 --> 22:43.403
You found something? Come on.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.572
You were at the Forensic Service.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.616
Tell me. Come on.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.159
Jun, what is it?

22:49.618 --> 22:50.786
Tell me.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.082
Get out.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.708
Fine. I'll keep my mouth shut.

22:56.792 --> 22:57.626
Dae-man.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.380
I said, get out!

23:04.424 --> 23:07.052
You think you're better
because you're a cop.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.560
You, stop right there.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.145
Stop.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.899
Bus 171! I'm gonna kill you!

23:21.817 --> 23:23.360
I'm home.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.487
You must be hungry.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.405
Yes.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.615
Stop!

23:29.282 --> 23:31.493
Go toss out the recycle garbage. And this.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.204
Hey.

23:34.913 --> 23:38.500
What have you been doing at home?
I just got off work. Give me a break!

23:42.254 --> 23:43.713
Feeding Hong-ji.

23:43.797 --> 23:47.717
Sweep, wipe, dishes, laundry,
and making dinner for you and Geon-wu!

23:54.266 --> 23:55.267
Put it on my finger.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.403
-You really think it's him?
-What?

24:06.987 --> 24:07.988
The killer.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.866
-Everyone at the market was talking.
-About what?

24:10.949 --> 24:14.077
The bakery lady lives next to Yong-gyu.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.287
And?

24:15.370 --> 24:16.872
She was going home that day

24:16.955 --> 24:20.000
and she saw a strange guy
in front of his house.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.460
The time aligns, too.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.671
You should tell Jun-su about it.

24:26.006 --> 24:26.840
Why should I?

24:27.841 --> 24:30.343
I'm sure Mr. Cop
has everything under control.

24:31.803 --> 24:32.804
Bastard.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.982
Why would the wife
buy the apartment in your name?

24:45.275 --> 24:47.235
Why would she hide it from her husband?

24:48.028 --> 24:50.155
I heard you were like brothers
since childhood.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.117
I wanted to help her keep that money.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.328
He had a hefty debt from loan sharks.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.163
How generous of you.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.250
What's this?

25:08.548 --> 25:09.758
Jun-su.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.927
'Fess up before you open this.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.596
It's your last chance.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.563
Just one question.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.856
Did you really kill her?

25:24.940 --> 25:25.774
No.

25:26.566 --> 25:27.984
I did not kill her.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.205
You're a lefty, right?

25:41.122 --> 25:41.957
Yes.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.085
What's the problem?

25:45.585 --> 25:46.795
He's a cop.

25:46.878 --> 25:50.507
Would he roll up the blade in his clothes
and actually put it at victim's place?

25:50.590 --> 25:51.967
That's not all.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.428
He bought the apartment
using the victim's money.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.347
He's a lefty. What else do you need?

25:58.014 --> 25:59.057
A lefty?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.936
And you call yourself
the head of homicide.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.021
Fuck.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.107
Where are your manners?
The kids are watching.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.402
How many junk foods did you find?

26:10.944 --> 26:11.778
Let me see.

26:12.779 --> 26:13.863
Bring it, now.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.200
What? What's the matter?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.203
You have a problem with me?

26:21.413 --> 26:22.330
Son of a bitch.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.000
Let go!

26:25.083 --> 26:25.959
I said, let go!

26:26.042 --> 26:26.876
Damn it.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.212
Let go, you bastard!

26:29.296 --> 26:31.131
-Let go! I said, let go!
-Stop it, sir.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.633
-You fucking bastard!
-Let go of me!

26:39.556 --> 26:40.473
How about this.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.517
Sucks to be under your junior, right?

26:42.601 --> 26:45.145
Especially
for the legendary Noh Tae-su of the WAIS.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.230
Prove me wrong in two weeks.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.648
Then I'll leave.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.401
But if you fail, you leave.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.319
Okay?

26:53.820 --> 26:56.489
What? Thinking of the twins at home?

26:57.490 --> 27:00.619
Then fucking shut up
and go bring me the junk food list!

27:07.250 --> 27:08.668
If you don't keep your word

27:10.337 --> 27:11.463
you are dead meat.

27:12.756 --> 27:13.882
Son of a bitch.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.600
Man, I'm scared.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.024
YEONGGWANG BUTCHER SHOP

27:33.526 --> 27:34.653
It's me.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.614
Hey.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.412
Jun-su hasn't said anything?

27:45.747 --> 27:49.626
The suspect of the murder case
at an apartment on April 3rd

27:49.709 --> 27:52.212
turned out to be
an active regional police officer.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.713
A shocking turn of events.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.675
The suspect, Lee, denies all allegations.

27:56.758 --> 27:57.801
ACTIVE OFFICER
CHARGED FOR ADULTERY AND MURDER

27:57.884 --> 28:02.138
Police assures Lee as the perpetrator
given the evidence and circumstance.

28:08.019 --> 28:08.853
Damn it.

28:09.729 --> 28:12.732
Geon-wu loves his bread.

28:12.816 --> 28:16.611
I can't even tell you how adorable
he looks when he looks at bread.

28:16.695 --> 28:21.241
-You should get that kid more bread--
-Stop talking about something else!

28:21.324 --> 28:23.368
Just tell me about the guy from that day.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.871
I didn't know you had a temper.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.957
I feel bad for Geon-wu's mom.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.041
Gosh.

28:30.959 --> 28:31.918
Welcome.

28:34.629 --> 28:37.716
Isn't it too cold for a blowfly to be out?

28:39.426 --> 28:42.137
Oh, was it a blowfly?
I thought that was a cop.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.264
-Oh my!
-Out.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.057
Get out!

28:48.810 --> 28:51.479
You are the one
who saw the suspicious guy?

28:51.563 --> 28:52.564
Yes.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.691
How strange.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.652
Why all the fuss
after the killer's been caught?

29:03.324 --> 29:05.869
It must've been around 10 p.m.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.919
You see,
I'd left my phone at the store that day.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.339
So I went to get it
about 30 minutes later.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.510
And he was still there,
staring up at their balcony.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.431
That's as far as I saw.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.851
Anyway, he looked very suspicious.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.644
What did he look like?

29:32.520 --> 29:35.690
Probably in his mid-40s.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.358
Tall.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.319
With his eyebrows raised at the ends.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.988
-He looked like a goblin.
-A goblin…

29:42.530 --> 29:44.073
I'm getting goosebumps.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.910
PORORO

29:50.330 --> 29:52.332
Get out of my way, bastard.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.086
Do you remember the car model and number?

29:57.170 --> 29:59.464
I wrote it down
because I found him so suspicious.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.091
Right here.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.434
Crazy bastard.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.480
Give it to me.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.611
You don't think it's Jun-su either, right?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.114
You crazy bastard!

30:25.657 --> 30:27.242
You think Jun-su's an idiot?

30:27.325 --> 30:30.328
To roll up the weapon in his clothes
and put it in front of the victim's place?

30:30.411 --> 30:33.248
That's not evidence he's guilty.
That's evidence he's being framed!

30:33.331 --> 30:35.375
-Give me the number before I kill you.
-You and I…

30:35.458 --> 30:36.751
Let's work together.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.795
I'm a human. I don't work with blowflies!

30:40.421 --> 30:43.383
You can't deny I have reasoning skills.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.467
Shut up!

30:47.846 --> 30:50.682
I'm in my execution of duty!

30:50.765 --> 30:51.641
Please leave.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.561
Leave. Everyone, leave!

30:55.478 --> 30:57.647
Give me the number. I'll count to three.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.691
Or I'm arresting you for obstruction.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.234
-One.
-This isn't about you!

31:01.860 --> 31:03.528
We need to help Jun-su first.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.073
-Two.
-Just think of me as your chauffeur.

31:07.991 --> 31:11.286
You barely have enough time to investigate
and I'm a decent driver.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.330
-Three.
-32ME…

31:14.414 --> 31:15.707
Crazy bastard.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.793
-32ME and then?
-Wait, it's 32YOU.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.255
-YOU and then?
-Maybe not.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.800
Is it ME? ME or YOU?

31:28.636 --> 31:29.470
Me or you?

31:29.554 --> 31:30.597
Was it 32RU?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.186
Crazy bastard.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.396
34…

31:39.564 --> 31:41.190
Yes, sir. The car belongs to Jang Ho.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.191
Age 45.

31:43.234 --> 31:46.029
He owns an escort club
called WHO in Seocho-dong.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.490
-He lives at Bundang Town Village 102.
-What's this?

31:50.408 --> 31:53.119
You bastard. Keep up the good work!

31:55.204 --> 31:56.497
Is he out of his mind?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.918
Look how comfortable it is.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.294
Without me?

32:01.377 --> 32:04.714
You gotta drive, make a call,
take the note all on your own.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.426
Where to first?

32:09.135 --> 32:10.678
Home or the club?

32:10.762 --> 32:16.351
Fine. I'll grant your wish
so shut up fuck up and focus on driving.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.729
No?

32:20.730 --> 32:21.564
Then get out.

32:22.690 --> 32:23.816
Get out, bastard!

32:29.364 --> 32:30.698
Let's hit his house first.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.119
Who is this?

32:35.203 --> 32:36.871
-Yes--
-Police.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.748
Are you Jang Ho's wife?

32:38.831 --> 32:40.875
Did he do something wrong?

32:43.086 --> 32:45.588
No, we are talking to the witnesses.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.798
Is your husband inside?

32:46.881 --> 32:49.050
No, he went to China three days ago.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.093
-China--
-China…

32:53.680 --> 32:54.847
What brings him there?

32:54.931 --> 32:55.890
Business trip.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.267
-When does he get back?
-In 15 days or so?

32:59.018 --> 32:59.852
I see.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.231
Get up.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.323
I'm gonna get back at you.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.409
Why are you so upset?

33:14.993 --> 33:15.827
What?

33:16.536 --> 33:17.829
Never mind if not.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.083
Did Jun-su really kill that woman?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.461
Since we are on the topic

33:26.504 --> 33:28.423
I'm closing the store for a week.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.341
What?

33:30.842 --> 33:33.553
I think Jun-su is being framed.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.473
I'm gonna investigate it myself
and get him out.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.934
Was it a stray dog that died?

33:41.060 --> 33:42.395
Someone murdered a person.

33:42.478 --> 33:45.815
So I sit back and watch?
He could rot in prison for life.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.567
You are not a cop!

33:48.192 --> 33:49.027
Hey.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.779
I'm the 5th president
of the profiling club

33:51.863 --> 33:54.198
and I run
the biggest cold case forum in Korea!

33:54.282 --> 33:56.534
-Seriously!
-You'll wake the kids.

33:58.161 --> 34:01.789
Don't you dare close the store
and run off doing something else.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.625
We are over then.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.921
Fine, then five days.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.508
Fine. Three days.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.969
Okay, end of conversation.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.430
Have you gone mad?

34:17.513 --> 34:18.765
Are you gonna starve the kids?

34:18.848 --> 34:20.850
Fine! I won't do it!

34:24.145 --> 34:25.188
Ugh.

34:32.945 --> 34:38.159
I'll just go out at night
after business hours then.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.368
That's okay, right?

34:39.952 --> 34:40.787
Fine!

34:40.870 --> 34:43.372
Do whatever the hell you want to do, jerk!

34:48.961 --> 34:52.256
Hong-ji, what did daddy tell you? Shh!

34:53.800 --> 34:55.551
Her mom's sick.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.470
I had no choice.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.183
SEOUL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

35:07.271 --> 35:08.106
Wait up!

35:14.362 --> 35:15.196
You all right?

35:17.865 --> 35:19.283
What the hell's going on?

35:19.784 --> 35:21.619
What's this about loan sharks
and the apartment?

35:21.702 --> 35:23.037
It's as you've heard.

35:23.121 --> 35:23.996
How much do they owe?

35:24.789 --> 35:26.374
He probably doesn't know the details.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.962
The interest rate snowballed
and they're about to lose their apartment.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.006
You met the victim
on the day of the crime.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.759
-Yes.
-Tell me more about it.

35:38.427 --> 35:40.680
Are you really
going to hide it from Yong-gyu?

35:40.763 --> 35:41.722
That's the plan.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.266
Until we get divorced.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.226
It would've been hard for him too.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.562
So much he couldn't even call me.

35:48.938 --> 35:49.939
So what?

35:50.940 --> 35:53.067
I thought you decided against the divorce.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.322
Why else would I break the law as a cop
to help you out?

36:00.199 --> 36:01.617
Everyone makes a mistake.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.953
You'll deny your child a father for this?

36:09.250 --> 36:12.295
If we file for bankruptcy
and help you stop transitory action

36:12.795 --> 36:14.380
he can get back on his feet.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.262
Thanks anyway.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.890
-What time did she leave?
-Between 10 to 11 p.m.

36:24.724 --> 36:25.933
I'm not sure exactly.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.061
No, she must've left before 10 p.m.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.521
How do you know that?

36:32.690 --> 36:34.150
I'll explain later.

36:35.151 --> 36:35.985
Anyone in mind?

36:37.361 --> 36:38.321
No idea.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.574
At first, I thought it was the loan shark.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.659
But that can't be right.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.663
If they were after the money,
they wouldn't have done it this way.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.499
Jang Ho. He runs an escort club.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.417
You know him?

36:52.210 --> 36:53.127
I don't know him.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.381
Somebody is framing you.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.467
Try to think of something!

36:59.550 --> 37:00.927
Your time's up.

37:14.982 --> 37:15.816
Dae-man.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.444
Give that to Yong-gyu.

37:18.527 --> 37:19.403
HOW TO REPORT ILLEGAL TRANSITORY ACTION
HOW TO FILE BANKRUPTCY

37:19.487 --> 37:22.323
And take care of him
so he doesn't do anything stupid.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.408
Like he's in the position
to look out for someone.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.410
Why don't you worry about yourself!

37:29.538 --> 37:30.539
Tell me.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.668
I'm listening. What?

37:33.751 --> 37:36.128
I ran through
immigration record of Jang Ho.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.923
He hasn't even applied for visa to China.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.509
Do something, will you!

37:41.592 --> 37:42.802
Got milk in your car?

37:42.885 --> 37:44.136
Crazy bastard!

37:48.349 --> 37:49.558
VEGGIE MEAL FOR TODDLERS

37:59.860 --> 38:01.028
Right there.

38:03.572 --> 38:04.782
Shit.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.918
Where are you going?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.253
To Jang Ho.

38:18.004 --> 38:21.632
He lied to his wife about going to China.
You think he'd be up for meeting us?

38:23.050 --> 38:24.093
Get back in!

38:27.596 --> 38:31.767
No wonder your wife treats you like shit.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.978
I get treated like shit?

38:36.105 --> 38:37.565
You don't know me at all.

38:38.774 --> 38:40.943
Do you know what my friends call me?

38:41.027 --> 38:42.945
What, baby sitter?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.114
The Last Emperor.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.787
Even your kid is laughing at you.
Look at her staring at you.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.542
What kind of a man are you?

38:56.625 --> 38:58.794
Helping out with your wife's work.
How pathetic.

38:58.878 --> 39:01.589
Like you don't do chores at home?

39:01.672 --> 39:03.174
You don't do the dishes?

39:03.257 --> 39:04.091
What, dishes?

39:05.551 --> 39:06.552
You do the dishes?

39:08.137 --> 39:09.430
So much for having balls.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.808
What's that smell?

39:17.980 --> 39:19.231
Did she poop?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.197
They said I had three years of bad luck.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.324
I guess it starts right now.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.869
-Here.
-Hey, your kid!

39:31.952 --> 39:33.079
Where are you going?

39:33.162 --> 39:35.498
I forgot the diapers.
I'll go get it quickly.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.832
Damn it.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.377
No crying.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.172
Shit!

39:45.591 --> 39:47.718
What? Shit.

39:47.802 --> 39:48.761
Get your ass in here!

39:54.350 --> 39:56.352
She's loud and she stinks.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.105
Got wet tissues by chance?

39:59.188 --> 40:00.147
No, you bastard!

40:07.279 --> 40:08.531
Stay still, Hong-ji.

40:08.614 --> 40:09.448
Damn it.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.078
Stay still!
I'll get poop on your clothes--

40:14.578 --> 40:15.704
Smells like shit!

40:16.580 --> 40:20.042
Do you feed your baby
fermented beans instead of breast milk?

40:20.126 --> 40:20.960
Huh?

40:21.502 --> 40:24.338
I'm gonna kill you
if you come see me again!

40:25.506 --> 40:27.508
That is not the smell of baby poo.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.804
Maybe they feed her fermented skate.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.224
Do something about the dirty diaper!

40:35.307 --> 40:37.059
Get rid of it or toss it somewhere!

40:40.604 --> 40:42.565
-You crazy bastard--
-You told me to toss it!

40:42.648 --> 40:43.691
Oh my god.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.196
There!

40:50.406 --> 40:52.741
-Look there!
-Now you're dropping the honorifics?

40:56.996 --> 40:57.830
Shit.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.970
Why did you
go to Han Seo-yeong's place that day?

41:14.472 --> 41:15.473
That woman.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.893
I know her a bit from
when I was buying land.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.688
She kept bugging me
to sell the land I had.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.773
It got annoying so I sold it.

41:25.524 --> 41:26.358
Then guess what?

41:27.109 --> 41:29.195
They were building apartments there
a few months later.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.114
She must've felt guilty.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.158
She kept ignoring my calls.

41:34.658 --> 41:35.910
So I went in person.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.913
She bugs me even after she's dead.

41:39.413 --> 41:40.247
And then?

41:41.332 --> 41:42.625
She wasn't home.

41:42.708 --> 41:43.709
And then?

41:43.792 --> 41:45.336
And then what?

41:45.419 --> 41:46.879
I came back.

41:46.962 --> 41:47.922
What time?

41:48.005 --> 41:48.964
Around 10 p.m.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.799
I had an appointment at 11 p.m.

41:50.883 --> 41:51.967
With who?

41:53.302 --> 41:54.929
Do I need to talk about my private life?

41:55.012 --> 41:56.472
You don't have the rights.

41:57.723 --> 41:58.974
Who was it?

42:00.601 --> 42:01.435
I don't know.

42:02.019 --> 42:02.978
I don't remember.

42:04.104 --> 42:05.272
Who was it?

42:05.773 --> 42:07.274
Son of a bitch.

42:12.446 --> 42:15.115
Good girl! That a burp!

42:16.033 --> 42:17.618
What are you two?

42:17.701 --> 42:18.994
Are you really cops?

42:20.079 --> 42:21.705
Why are you playing with him?

42:22.414 --> 42:23.582
We already know who it is.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.292
Know what? You crazy…

42:26.043 --> 42:28.379
Hey, miss! Come over here and sit.

42:28.462 --> 42:29.838
Stop burning the coffee.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.967
Sister, come here quick! Please sit down!

42:33.050 --> 42:34.677
Don't make us come get you. Now!

42:41.183 --> 42:44.853
This was taken that night
on our way to Yeosu.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.397
SPEEDING TICKET

42:46.480 --> 42:49.191
I lied to my wife about going to China

42:50.734 --> 42:52.653
because I was going to
spend a few days with her.

42:52.736 --> 42:56.824
I'm sorry. Please don't tell my wife.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.368
Excuse me.

42:59.451 --> 43:02.371
Something was a little strange that night.

43:02.871 --> 43:06.125
Like I said, no one was home that night.

43:06.625 --> 43:09.461
But when I got down,
I saw someone in the living room.

43:10.045 --> 43:10.921
Someone was there?

43:11.005 --> 43:11.839
Yes.

43:12.339 --> 43:14.341
There were two of them.

43:16.051 --> 43:17.094
How'd you know?

43:17.720 --> 43:18.554
Know what?

43:18.637 --> 43:20.139
That barista was his mistress.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.518
Jang Ho's escort club is named WHO.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.437
The coffee shop was WHO IS.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.063
Same font.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.983
And a pretty barista
burning the coffee looking nervous.

43:31.066 --> 43:32.109
Then the conclusion is…

43:33.277 --> 43:34.111
You understand?

43:35.988 --> 43:38.282
Who are the two that Jang Ho saw?

43:38.365 --> 43:40.326
What a moron.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.620
Who else?
One's the perp and the other, victim!

43:42.703 --> 43:43.662
Nope.

43:43.746 --> 43:44.913
The victim wasn't home then.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.625
-What?
-Jang Ho left by 10:30 p.m. at the latest.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.961
Because he was at Giheung-Dongtan
at 11:12 p.m.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.423
That means
he couldn't have seen the victim.

43:54.506 --> 43:55.841
Bullshit.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.843
What are you grounding your story on?

43:58.427 --> 43:59.511
You can't be serious.

44:00.596 --> 44:01.764
No way.

44:02.264 --> 44:03.849
You're from Police University.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.352
Look at this dude.

44:07.227 --> 44:08.937
What you said at the correctional.

44:09.021 --> 44:12.441
That Jun-su and the victim parted
by 10:30 p.m. at the latest.

44:12.524 --> 44:13.359
Right.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.778
Gotcha, you bastard.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.739
Victim's home was 5 min by car
from the departure point.

44:18.822 --> 44:21.116
-I know. I live there.
-Hear me out.

44:21.742 --> 44:26.455
They parted before 10 p.m.
and Jang Ho left by 10:30 p.m.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.166
The distance is 5 min by car.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.544
And yet Jang Ho
couldn't have seen the victim?

44:35.255 --> 44:36.215
Isn't that weird?

44:36.924 --> 44:38.175
Is it only weird to me?

44:39.009 --> 44:39.927
Tell me.

44:40.010 --> 44:42.012
Before I deep fry you in a load of crap.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.223
Police University grad, my ass.

44:44.306 --> 44:45.307
Bastard.

44:45.391 --> 44:46.600
The couple both worked.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.812
So they drop off the baby with grandma
at Suyu-ri store during daytime.

44:49.895 --> 44:52.731
-And?
-How was the baby at the crime scene?

44:52.815 --> 44:53.649
Well?

44:54.942 --> 44:58.570
Yong-gyu drank till he passed out
and got home at 3 a.m. with me.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.365
Then who brought the kid home?

45:02.574 --> 45:05.786
After she met Jun-su, if she stopped by
Suyuri and then came home

45:06.412 --> 45:08.747
it would take her at least an hour.
Understand?

45:08.831 --> 45:10.332
Damn it.

45:12.334 --> 45:15.212
You are missing one thing.

45:15.295 --> 45:17.423
-What?
-What if the kid was there to begin with?

45:17.506 --> 45:19.425
How does a toddler stay home all alone?

45:19.508 --> 45:22.136
You keep all options open
in investigation!

45:22.219 --> 45:24.304
Not just based on a hunch, bastard!

45:24.388 --> 45:26.390
Who's the one
investigating on a hunch here?

45:26.473 --> 45:29.643
"If a wife dies, the husband is the perp"?
Does that make sense?

45:29.727 --> 45:32.354
Shut up and
tell me how to get to the store.

45:32.438 --> 45:35.315
I don't know.
I only heard it in passing from Jun-su.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.025
And you act like you know everything.

45:37.109 --> 45:38.277
So loud!

45:39.611 --> 45:42.281
Yes, she definitely
picked up the kid that day.

45:42.364 --> 45:43.574
Around 11 p.m.?

45:49.204 --> 45:51.039
WEDDING STORY

45:51.582 --> 45:53.000
If Jang Ho was telling the truth

45:53.917 --> 45:55.210
two people were--

45:55.294 --> 45:57.546
Hiding there in advance.
To kill Han Seo-yeong.

45:58.630 --> 45:59.673
What if those two

46:00.632 --> 46:01.884
were you two?

46:01.967 --> 46:03.135
Seriously…

46:08.891 --> 46:09.975
And the culprit is…

46:11.769 --> 46:13.771
Come out for a second!

46:14.646 --> 46:16.231
Come out for a second!

46:17.941 --> 46:19.359
Fine, I'm coming!

46:20.444 --> 46:21.278
Why?

46:22.279 --> 46:23.614
Having a fashion show in the room?

46:25.532 --> 46:26.700
What do you think?

46:26.784 --> 46:27.659
You really wanna hear?

46:28.744 --> 46:30.370
-No.
-Bring me the formula.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.082
That's why you called me out?

46:34.166 --> 46:35.709
No, I called so you can breastfeed her!

46:40.297 --> 46:42.758
Oh, how do you know
that detective from yesterday?

46:47.262 --> 46:48.305
Who?

46:55.103 --> 46:56.480
Oh, our frequent customer.

46:56.563 --> 46:58.440
Are you by chance…

46:58.524 --> 46:59.942
How could I, with the kid?

47:00.025 --> 47:01.443
Stop talking nonsense.

47:06.782 --> 47:07.616
You're right.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.201
How do you know him?

47:09.284 --> 47:11.161
He's the dad of the twins I teach.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.205
-Oh, your tutoring students.
-Yeah.

47:15.415 --> 47:17.793
I need to get him a pair of rubber gloves.

47:17.876 --> 47:22.506
He's always whining about the gloves
being too small when he does the dishes.

47:22.589 --> 47:23.549
Reminded me of you.

47:24.591 --> 47:25.467
What do you mean?

47:25.551 --> 47:28.178
I feel bad for him.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.139
The wife has quite a temper
and he's always getting grilled.

47:31.223 --> 47:32.933
It's embarrassing for me to watch.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.894
You're blessed to be with someone like me.

47:36.937 --> 47:37.771
Of course.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.483
How peculiar.

47:42.818 --> 47:45.195
Where do I keep smelling the poo?

47:46.405 --> 47:47.614
This is frustrating.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.826
This is driving me crazy.

48:05.757 --> 48:06.592
Crazy bastard.

48:06.675 --> 48:08.510
Burger's always the right choice
for detectives.

48:10.137 --> 48:10.971
Crazy bastard.

48:11.555 --> 48:15.100
Come to think of it,
there's a hole in Jang Ho's alibi.

48:15.183 --> 48:16.435
-No, there isn't.
-Yes, there is.

48:16.518 --> 48:17.352
No.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.688
The watch that the victim was wearing.

48:19.771 --> 48:22.608
That watch aligns perfectly
with the estimated time of death by NFS.

48:22.691 --> 48:24.443
So shut up and eat!

48:24.526 --> 48:25.736
Not the time. The place.

48:26.486 --> 48:28.906
What if the perp killed the victim
somewhere else

48:28.989 --> 48:30.324
and moved the body to the house?

48:30.407 --> 48:33.076
He set the time to the time of the murder
and then smashed it.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.537
If that's true,
then Jang Ho's alibi doesn't work.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.789
He might as well have buried her alive.

48:37.873 --> 48:39.958
Why drag the body
into that building full of people?

48:40.042 --> 48:41.585
He might have had a reason!

48:42.836 --> 48:43.712
Shut up.

48:44.838 --> 48:47.841
In the great adventure of Sherlock Holmes,
the highlight of my childhood

48:47.925 --> 48:49.092
Sherlock says this.

48:49.801 --> 48:52.888
"When you have eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable

48:52.971 --> 48:54.014
must be the truth."

48:54.097 --> 48:55.766
Shut up, you bastard!

48:56.516 --> 48:57.768
You listen to me.

49:01.021 --> 49:03.941
You know who's the hardest to catch
in a homicide case?

49:04.691 --> 49:07.819
Someone who kills for no reason
and runs away.

49:07.903 --> 49:11.031
Because the more you think,
the more trace you leave behind.

49:11.114 --> 49:15.118
Stop talking about the nonsense
you picked up from fictional stories.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.578
Don't get so cocky.

49:17.913 --> 49:19.289
Eat before you get on. It'll stink.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.126
You don't know anything.

49:26.546 --> 49:29.466
Why don't you take off your raincoat?

49:30.217 --> 49:31.176
It's not even raining.

49:32.177 --> 49:33.011
A raincoat?

49:33.512 --> 49:35.847
Got yours from the convenience store?
For how much?

49:35.931 --> 49:36.890
5,000 won?

49:39.226 --> 49:41.853
Oh, right. I had a gift for you.

49:42.437 --> 49:43.438
Almost forgot.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.487
Extra large. It should fit well.

49:52.114 --> 49:54.908
Why are you giving me a woman's item?

49:55.617 --> 49:58.745
My wife's a tutor
and she told me to give this to you.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.501
Why do you keep eating the kids' snacks?

50:05.168 --> 50:06.253
Drinking wasn't enough?

50:06.336 --> 50:08.463
Washing it down with expensive probiotics?

50:09.881 --> 50:12.342
Honey, the teacher is here.

50:12.426 --> 50:13.885
You peed standing up again?

50:14.469 --> 50:16.471
I'm so sick of it! Disgusting!

50:17.264 --> 50:18.724
I'm so fed up!

50:19.933 --> 50:21.309
I'm sorry.

50:24.062 --> 50:25.772
I'll get going then.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.649
-Sure.
-Okay.

50:28.316 --> 50:29.151
Bye.

50:29.234 --> 50:32.404
It's not that I don't want to do it.
I can't do the dishes.

50:33.739 --> 50:36.783
The gloves don't fit.

50:40.662 --> 50:41.872
Ma'am.

50:42.456 --> 50:43.498
Calm down.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.002
-Dad, just do it without them.
-Dad, just do it without them.

50:48.670 --> 50:49.880
Mrs. Kang.

50:50.756 --> 50:52.758
Why don't we call it a day.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.677
-Girls, stop studying and go out to play.
-Wait!

50:59.431 --> 51:00.599
Wow, it fits.

51:00.682 --> 51:02.100
This thing stretches.

51:04.644 --> 51:06.354
Remember what you told me?

51:06.438 --> 51:08.440
"So much for having balls."

51:10.108 --> 51:11.401
Doing the dishes. Wait!

51:11.485 --> 51:13.111
Where are you going?

51:13.653 --> 51:16.031
Huh? Where are you going?

51:16.114 --> 51:18.283
What's going on? Where are you?

51:18.366 --> 51:20.702
I'm picking up the late returned books

51:20.786 --> 51:22.245
so leave Hong-ji at the bakery.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.163
Fine.

51:23.246 --> 51:25.248
BOOKS INSIDE

51:28.710 --> 51:31.546
What do you take me for, a moron?

51:31.630 --> 51:32.464
What's up?

51:33.006 --> 51:34.466
-Is the bakery lady not there?
-You!

51:35.175 --> 51:36.468
I'm gonna kill you!

51:36.885 --> 51:39.096
-You want to see me go crazy, don't you!
-Hello?

51:39.179 --> 51:41.348
I can't hear you. Hello?

51:41.431 --> 51:45.143
-Hello--
-I hear fine. Thank you for the gloves!

51:47.312 --> 51:48.146
Hey!

51:50.607 --> 51:53.318
How did you get there?

51:54.820 --> 51:57.405
All women are carnivores.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.741
They start out as herbivores

51:59.825 --> 52:02.202
but realize their instincts
as they get married

52:03.203 --> 52:04.329
and show their teeth.

52:05.705 --> 52:07.290
How long have you been married?

52:07.874 --> 52:08.834
Six years.

52:08.917 --> 52:10.919
She must be a wildcat by now.

52:11.753 --> 52:13.213
How about your wife?

52:14.214 --> 52:15.465
She's a tiger.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.591
As big as an elephant.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.219
Why must we live this way?

52:19.302 --> 52:21.513
When you die, you ask god.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.015
It was better in our fathers' generation.

52:24.099 --> 52:25.559
It was.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.227
They made better living then.

52:28.478 --> 52:29.855
It all boils down to money.

52:30.689 --> 52:33.358
The secret to living peacefully
with a carnivore.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.318
Is there any other way?

52:37.821 --> 52:38.738
No.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.538
I suddenly find you warm and likable.

52:47.747 --> 52:49.291
You're not so bad yourself.

52:50.959 --> 52:51.835
Then

52:53.128 --> 52:54.713
can I call you hyeong?

52:56.214 --> 52:57.757
Call me hyeongnim, bastard.

52:59.050 --> 53:00.135
Hyeongnim.

53:03.680 --> 53:04.806
It's me. What's up?

53:04.890 --> 53:05.765
What?

53:06.975 --> 53:07.934
A murder case?

53:08.685 --> 53:12.439
Min-ah! Who did this?

53:12.522 --> 53:15.525
Let go! Honey!

53:15.609 --> 53:19.863
Who did this! Who!

53:20.947 --> 53:21.781
Sir.

53:22.616 --> 53:23.533
Why the commotion?

53:23.617 --> 53:25.327
The victim is Detective Ma's wife.

53:33.793 --> 53:35.003
Name is Yang Min-ah.

53:35.086 --> 53:37.130
As I told you, wife of Detective Ma.

53:37.214 --> 53:38.798
She ran the pottery studio.

53:38.882 --> 53:41.384
She was in the furnace
at the time of discovery.

53:42.260 --> 53:43.136
Detective.

53:43.220 --> 53:46.056
I think this phone belonged to the victim.
I found it.

53:54.689 --> 53:57.025
The time it was taken was 1:05 a.m.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.361
Why did the perp take the photo?

54:01.738 --> 54:04.115
I brought this just in case.

54:04.199 --> 54:06.576
It's a list of people
arrested by Detective Ma.

54:08.495 --> 54:09.871
Get out.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.957
PERSONS IN CUSTODY
HOMICIDE TEAM 1, DETECTIVE MA DONG-HUN

54:12.040 --> 54:14.626
-You can't be here.
-We used to be good.

54:14.709 --> 54:15.543
I know.

54:19.297 --> 54:20.674
-This is the scene of murder?
-Yes.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.550
-What's that?
-Back door to the studio.

54:22.634 --> 54:25.095
-No, you can't.
-One second.

54:26.137 --> 54:27.806
-Just a minute.
-No, you can't.

54:28.890 --> 54:30.892
This door is one-sided.

54:31.518 --> 54:33.270
This only leads
from the studio to the garage.

54:34.312 --> 54:36.439
-So?
-If she was killed here

54:36.523 --> 54:37.732
and then moved to the furnace

54:37.816 --> 54:40.151
it should be
on the CCTV at the front door.

54:40.235 --> 54:44.155
Because only the front door
gives access from outside the building.

54:45.448 --> 54:46.658
What about the blood?

54:46.741 --> 54:48.702
It must be from the perp
as he was running away

54:48.785 --> 54:50.287
or he fell down.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.122
-What's that?
-What?

54:52.205 --> 54:55.667
-Who are you?
-He killed her there, hence the blood.

54:55.750 --> 54:57.794
If he killed her inside,
why'd the blood be there?

54:57.877 --> 55:01.214
Mr. Kang Dae-man. Please leave!

55:01.298 --> 55:05.343
I'm Jun-su's friend. You're being rude.

55:05.844 --> 55:07.554
Hey, get out.

55:13.310 --> 55:15.770
The two cases are by the same culprits.

55:15.854 --> 55:16.813
How so?

55:16.896 --> 55:18.982
There was a tiny trace of blood pattern

55:19.065 --> 55:22.277
that indicates a strong impact.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.362
The victim was killed
in the basement garage.

55:25.405 --> 55:27.407
And there was an accomplice.

55:28.783 --> 55:29.659
That's right.

55:30.618 --> 55:34.039
One killed her in the garage
and the other was in the studio.

55:34.122 --> 55:38.335
Two homicides with accomplice
within ten days in same jurisdiction.

55:39.044 --> 55:40.587
Something's going on.

55:40.670 --> 55:41.546
Another thing.

55:41.629 --> 55:43.465
The two victims lived
in the same apartment

55:43.548 --> 55:44.799
until the beginning of the year

55:44.883 --> 55:45.925
in the same building.

55:46.384 --> 55:47.802
Still think Jang Ho's the perp?

55:47.886 --> 55:49.512
Drag the body to the 15th floor?

55:49.596 --> 55:52.265
You don't know what you're talking about!

55:54.476 --> 55:55.685
Turn on the engine.

56:00.565 --> 56:02.984
Hey! Stop the car!

56:08.990 --> 56:09.991
Shit!

56:11.659 --> 56:12.869
You weren't asleep?

56:13.912 --> 56:15.330
Is it fun playing cops?

56:16.539 --> 56:17.582
Is it fun?

56:23.129 --> 56:25.757
You wanna run away, don't you?
Being a dad and all.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.968
-Right?
-No.

56:29.552 --> 56:31.971
-Never.
-I want to run away.

56:34.432 --> 56:36.643
If it wasn't for the kids,
I'd run away now.

56:51.783 --> 56:53.076
Sit down for a bit.

56:54.202 --> 56:55.912
Let me massage your shoulders.

56:56.413 --> 56:59.374
I won't do it again. Take a seat.

56:59.457 --> 57:00.708
Let's go, Geon-wu.

57:00.792 --> 57:02.335
Mi-ok.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.504
I'll help out with house chores.

57:04.587 --> 57:07.757
Mi-ok, don't do anything!
Just rest when you get home.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.217
I'll do everything. Okay?

57:11.010 --> 57:11.886
Geon-wu.

57:12.554 --> 57:14.222
You are my only hope.

57:14.305 --> 57:16.307
Why aren't you speaking with dad?

57:16.391 --> 57:17.976
He's not worth talking to.

57:18.059 --> 57:18.935
Why not?

57:19.018 --> 57:21.438
He's not acting like a dad.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.773
Dad cried earlier.

57:24.649 --> 57:25.483
What?

57:25.567 --> 57:26.985
Dad, why are you crying?

57:28.528 --> 57:29.529
I'm not crying.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.116
You're crying.

57:36.494 --> 57:39.873
Geon-wu. I really love your mom.

57:40.874 --> 57:45.295
But I'm sad
because I can't make her happy.

57:47.797 --> 57:48.882
But Geon-wu.

57:48.965 --> 57:54.053
Daddy swears he will make mommy
tha happiest person in the world.

57:55.513 --> 57:56.598
Isn't Dad cool?

57:56.681 --> 57:58.183
No.

57:59.851 --> 58:00.685
Sly jerk.

58:01.895 --> 58:02.729
Come quick.

58:10.111 --> 58:13.907
-Who is this?
-Have you seen these two women?

58:13.990 --> 58:16.493
-I don't know them.
-Sure.

58:24.959 --> 58:26.336
-Have you seen these two?
-No.

58:26.419 --> 58:27.420
Take a good look!

58:28.296 --> 58:29.172
Hey!

58:29.881 --> 58:31.841
Have you seen these two together?

58:31.925 --> 58:32.759
I'm not sure.

58:32.842 --> 58:35.678
Are we sure these two were
the only ones killed?

58:36.262 --> 58:39.891
I looked through the cases in Seoul
in the last year for similar MO.

58:40.558 --> 58:41.392
There was none.

58:41.476 --> 58:43.061
I found one.

58:44.395 --> 58:45.939
Stop quacking and turn on the engine.

58:46.022 --> 58:48.274
Remember the Yangjaecheon murder case
from ten months ago?

58:50.860 --> 58:51.694
Let's go.

58:52.445 --> 58:55.031
Do you remember the unresolved mystery
from that case?

58:55.114 --> 58:56.908
What mystery?

58:56.991 --> 59:00.537
The perp dragged the body out of the river
all the way to the bike path.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.038
WHO MOVED THE BODY?

59:02.121 --> 59:03.498
Why would the perp have done that?

59:05.959 --> 59:08.836
What does that case
have anything to do with this case?

59:09.504 --> 59:11.005
I heard from the newbie

59:11.089 --> 59:13.591
that you found blood on the watch.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.718
And only on the back of the watch.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.513
-So?
-And in the studio murder case

59:19.222 --> 59:21.099
why did the perps leave a photo?

59:21.182 --> 59:22.350
Don't you get it?

59:22.934 --> 59:25.812
In all three cases,
the perps are telling us on purpose.

59:25.895 --> 59:27.855
Tell us what on purpose?

59:27.939 --> 59:29.065
The time.

59:29.524 --> 59:30.525
Time of the crime.

59:33.027 --> 59:33.945
MONDAY
1:05 A.M.

59:35.196 --> 59:37.699
Fine, I'll give you
the time and the photo.

59:37.782 --> 59:38.741
What else?

59:38.825 --> 59:39.826
The body.

59:39.909 --> 59:41.995
Would a body
that's been in the water for a long time

59:42.579 --> 59:44.414
show an accurate time of death at autopsy?

59:44.497 --> 59:45.790
Definitely not.

59:45.873 --> 59:48.585
But if they wanted to
show the accurate time?

59:49.419 --> 59:52.255
They need to get it out of the water
to be discovered as soon as possible.

59:53.047 --> 59:55.592
Why would the perp tell us
the time of the crime on purpose?

59:55.675 --> 59:58.636
That's what we have to find out from now.

59:59.554 --> 1:00:00.388
Bullshit.

1:00:01.556 --> 1:00:02.390
Turn the car.

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:04.934
After we confirm the suspect.

1:00:05.018 --> 1:00:06.227
Turn it now!

1:00:06.311 --> 1:00:07.812
Let's confirm first.

1:00:09.105 --> 1:00:10.023
Turn it!

1:00:10.106 --> 1:00:12.108
How am I gonna turn on the bridge?

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:14.193
Just turn it around!

1:00:17.071 --> 1:00:18.406
Do it!

1:00:18.489 --> 1:00:21.200
Listen to me. Damn it!

1:00:21.909 --> 1:00:24.662
They ended the internal investigation
on this case as suicide.

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:26.748
-Suicide?
-Yeah.

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:29.167
Was it two months since the case?

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:32.545
They found a girl strangulated to death
near the crime scene.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:36.215
She was strangled
using Reina's hand bag chain.

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:38.134
So in the process
of kidnapping the child--

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:41.763
She accidentally killed the girl
and killed herself out of guilt.

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:43.473
Right.

1:00:44.557 --> 1:00:45.808
Blowfly bastard.

1:00:45.892 --> 1:00:48.436
Who moved the body
after having committed suicide?

1:00:48.519 --> 1:00:49.354
Huh?

1:00:49.437 --> 1:00:51.439
Get up.

1:00:51.522 --> 1:00:52.357
Bastard.

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:54.067
Think about it.

1:00:54.150 --> 1:00:56.110
While she was bleeding to death

1:00:56.194 --> 1:00:58.196
she decided to walk out like this?

1:00:58.279 --> 1:01:01.324
-It makes no sense.
-She died while she was crawling out.

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:03.534
-Look at her condition!
-Her condition?

1:01:03.618 --> 1:01:05.328
-Were you at the crime scene?
-Hey.

1:01:06.496 --> 1:01:07.372
Who is this?

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:09.957
He was one of the suspects.

1:01:10.041 --> 1:01:11.250
Lee Yu-no.

1:01:12.001 --> 1:01:12.877
Why? Who is he?

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:16.631
Lee Yu-no. Age, 27.

1:01:16.714 --> 1:01:19.967
Arrested for larceny and rape
five years ago in Naegok-dong.

1:01:20.051 --> 1:01:23.471
Sentenced to ten years,
got three years off, released last year.

1:01:23.554 --> 1:01:25.556
The arresting officer
was from the Social Order Unit

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:27.433
of the Seocho Police Department.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:28.518
Detective Ma Dong-hun.

1:01:28.601 --> 1:01:31.479
Currently a homicide detective
at Seongbuk Police Department

1:01:31.562 --> 1:01:33.815
and the husband of Yang Min-ah,
the studio murder victim.

1:01:33.898 --> 1:01:34.732
Well?

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:37.860
I think we found one
of the two we're looking for.

1:01:37.944 --> 1:01:40.196
Still think I'm a blowfly? Well?

1:01:41.072 --> 1:01:42.323
Am I a blowfly?

1:01:42.407 --> 1:01:43.491
Don't get ahead of yourself.

1:01:43.574 --> 1:01:45.743
Coincidences are common in investigations.

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:47.537
Nah.

1:01:48.413 --> 1:01:49.580
-Really?
-Hey!

1:01:49.664 --> 1:01:51.749
Lee Yu-no has one suspicion.

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:52.875
His hair from the sewer.

1:01:53.459 --> 1:01:55.628
Think about it.
There were tons of other hair there.

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.296
But Lee Yu-no was an ex-convict

1:01:57.380 --> 1:01:58.464
and became a suspect.

1:01:58.548 --> 1:01:59.966
Is that not clear to you?

1:02:00.049 --> 1:02:01.259
Nah.

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:03.052
Crazy bastard.

1:02:04.011 --> 1:02:05.388
Okay.

1:02:05.972 --> 1:02:08.683
Wanna hear a prophecy?

1:02:12.645 --> 1:02:15.940
They'll find a strong suspect
for the studio murder case soon.

1:02:16.023 --> 1:02:19.360
They'll find a bicycle chain
near the studio.

1:02:20.611 --> 1:02:23.114
Surprisingly,
the victim's blood is found on it.

1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:28.536
The suspect knew the victim closely
and was the owner of the bicycle chain.

1:02:30.204 --> 1:02:32.081
Sorry, didn't catch that.
A dog was barking.

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:37.712
Just watch and see
if my prophecy comes true.

1:02:38.212 --> 1:02:42.049
Man, fucking dog keeps barking.

1:02:50.808 --> 1:02:52.769
Hey, what's going on?

1:02:52.852 --> 1:02:54.854
We just caught a suspect
for the studio murder case.

1:02:57.857 --> 1:03:02.069
I visited the studio frequently
so it's natural my prints were there.

1:03:03.237 --> 1:03:04.530
Then what's this?

1:03:05.782 --> 1:03:06.616
What's this?

1:03:07.492 --> 1:03:09.243
-You don't recognize it?
-No!

1:03:09.327 --> 1:03:10.995
Then why'd you change your bicycle chain!

1:03:12.163 --> 1:03:13.247
Where did you find this?

1:03:13.331 --> 1:03:16.959
It was me, once again,
that found it near the studio.

1:03:17.043 --> 1:03:18.044
-Huh?
-Who?

1:03:18.127 --> 1:03:20.004
It's not much.
Just traces of the victim's blood.

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.632
How should I know? Damn it!

1:03:26.469 --> 1:03:28.971
Geon-wu, didn't I tell you
not to put things like this here?

1:03:29.055 --> 1:03:31.390
This is dad's desk and work space.

1:03:31.474 --> 1:03:33.601
Dad's space. Just for dad.

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:38.397
Sit down and rest.

1:03:38.898 --> 1:03:40.233
Laundry, right?

1:03:45.029 --> 1:03:46.531
Honey, what are you doing?

1:03:46.614 --> 1:03:50.117
Go sit next to Geon-wu.

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:56.165
No. Go sit.

1:03:56.874 --> 1:03:57.708
I got it.

1:04:01.045 --> 1:04:02.588
Dad really is cool.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:04.549
No, he's not.

1:04:10.388 --> 1:04:12.598
Where did you go earlier?
The store was closed.

1:04:13.975 --> 1:04:15.518
Where did you go?

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:16.894
Go where?

1:04:22.984 --> 1:04:23.943
I was in the store.

1:04:25.653 --> 1:04:27.280
Don't just guess.

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:34.495
Keep massaging.

1:04:40.334 --> 1:04:42.086
Where'd you learn such bad manners?

1:04:42.169 --> 1:04:44.547
Don't you dare go doing
weird things again!

1:04:45.923 --> 1:04:46.966
Get back down.

1:04:48.968 --> 1:04:52.221
You were sleeping with the victim, right?

1:04:52.305 --> 1:04:54.432
-Sometimes.
-Why'd you break up?

1:04:54.515 --> 1:04:56.976
She kept mentioning divorce
and it pressured me.

1:04:57.476 --> 1:04:59.478
-So I said we should break up.
-Divorce?

1:05:01.397 --> 1:05:06.861
Yeah, the husband was a crazy bastard.

1:05:06.944 --> 1:05:09.614
He's been seeing an escort girl for years.

1:05:10.197 --> 1:05:11.991
Apparently he paid for her rent deposit.

1:05:12.074 --> 1:05:13.743
He took out a loan for it.

1:05:13.826 --> 1:05:15.578
Son of a bitch!

1:05:17.914 --> 1:05:19.707
-You don't know anything!
-Grab him!

1:05:21.626 --> 1:05:22.543
Did you hear?

1:05:25.546 --> 1:05:28.299
Jun-su's trial date is set.

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:31.928
Same day you are retiring.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.722
Coincidence or a game of fate?

1:05:37.767 --> 1:05:38.768
Five days to go.

1:05:44.732 --> 1:05:47.026
I'm sorry for causing the trouble.

1:05:47.526 --> 1:05:49.528
-Detective Ma, let me ask you something.
-Sure.

1:05:51.072 --> 1:05:52.865
Remember Lee Yu-no
you arrested five years ago?

1:05:53.741 --> 1:05:55.242
Yes, I remember him.

1:05:55.326 --> 1:05:58.913
Cut to the chase. How would you catch him
if you had to do it again now?

1:06:03.334 --> 1:06:04.460
Where are you going?

1:06:04.543 --> 1:06:05.586
Huh?

1:06:05.670 --> 1:06:06.963
Isn't the store closed today?

1:06:07.046 --> 1:06:07.880
Yeah.

1:06:11.801 --> 1:06:13.427
Today's civil defense training.

1:06:13.511 --> 1:06:15.012
You just go stamp, right?

1:06:15.846 --> 1:06:17.014
Go ahead.

1:06:20.017 --> 1:06:22.103
Actually, they said
there's some training this year.

1:06:22.645 --> 1:06:23.479
What training?

1:06:24.939 --> 1:06:28.609
Guerilla training or shooting, probably.

1:06:28.693 --> 1:06:31.237
Or maybe even a march.

1:06:32.488 --> 1:06:33.906
Civil defense includes a march?

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:37.410
These bastards squeeze everything
out of us, without paying a dime.

1:06:38.327 --> 1:06:39.578
I'll try to finish early.

1:06:40.454 --> 1:06:41.288
Wait.

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:51.507
You gonna march looking like that?

1:06:58.806 --> 1:07:00.933
That moron. What's the matter this time?

1:07:08.149 --> 1:07:09.859
Catch Lee Yu-no again…

1:07:09.942 --> 1:07:15.364
I'd start with PC cafes or saunas
near Hongdae first.

1:07:16.198 --> 1:07:17.033
No?

1:07:39.722 --> 1:07:40.556
I'm sorry.

1:07:40.639 --> 1:07:42.391
-How'd you know?
-What?

1:07:42.475 --> 1:07:43.684
That prophecy of yours.

1:07:43.768 --> 1:07:44.894
Remember Manager Na?

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:49.148
Na was the most probably suspect
compared to Lee Yu-no.

1:07:49.815 --> 1:07:51.901
Reina's sponsor and club owner.

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:56.155
We found her missing phone
near his place on the day of the crime.

1:07:56.947 --> 1:07:59.283
I set up a theory
that they framed Manager Na.

1:07:59.366 --> 1:08:01.243
Just like they framed Jun-su.

1:08:01.327 --> 1:08:04.830
And if the three cases really are related

1:08:04.914 --> 1:08:07.875
then we'd see a similar pattern
in the studio murder case.

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:10.920
What about the chain?

1:08:11.879 --> 1:08:13.672
Two lines of scarring
on the victim's neck.

1:08:13.756 --> 1:08:16.050
Oil stain, easily accessible

1:08:16.133 --> 1:08:17.927
and a piece of metal
you can use to strangle.

1:08:18.010 --> 1:08:19.261
Bicycle chain.

1:08:22.556 --> 1:08:23.516
Same as me.

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:24.558
What's the same?

1:08:24.642 --> 1:08:26.977
I had the same reasoning as you.

1:08:27.061 --> 1:08:29.021
I just didn't say it
because I'm not a babbler.

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:33.442
Now I see what Jun-su was going through.

1:08:34.568 --> 1:08:36.570
No wonder he was losing weight.

1:08:41.492 --> 1:08:42.451
It's me.

1:08:43.702 --> 1:08:45.371
What? Get out.

1:08:46.205 --> 1:08:47.540
-Huh?
-It's Detective Ma.

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:48.874
Regarding Lee Yu-no.

1:08:49.458 --> 1:08:51.710
He called me once right after he got out.

1:08:52.253 --> 1:08:56.757
I traced his number back
to a tropical fish store called, "Mew."

1:09:07.059 --> 1:09:08.018
Anyone there?

1:09:09.937 --> 1:09:10.771
Anyone?

1:09:35.087 --> 1:09:37.214
-You crazy?
-I can't see well.

1:09:53.689 --> 1:09:54.523
Anyone there?

1:09:55.649 --> 1:09:57.067
-Hello?
-Shh. Be quiet.

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:00.154
What is that?

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:05.242
Stay right here.

1:10:37.858 --> 1:10:38.943
What is this?

1:10:42.696 --> 1:10:44.031
Get out of the water!

1:10:55.542 --> 1:10:57.670
Hey, you all right?

1:10:59.338 --> 1:11:00.798
Go out and shut the power!

1:11:00.881 --> 1:11:01.882
Okay.

1:11:07.972 --> 1:11:08.806
What?

1:11:10.182 --> 1:11:11.934
-What are you doing?
-The door's locked.

1:11:13.811 --> 1:11:16.105
Hello? Anyone there?

1:11:17.648 --> 1:11:18.482
Hello!

1:11:19.566 --> 1:11:20.985
Anyone there?

1:11:21.568 --> 1:11:23.237
What should we do?

1:11:42.172 --> 1:11:43.424
Stay still!

1:11:43.507 --> 1:11:44.800
That's more dangerous!

1:11:52.725 --> 1:11:53.684
What are you doing?

1:11:54.518 --> 1:11:57.187
Even a drop of water and you will die!
Don't move!

1:11:58.397 --> 1:12:02.276
Help me out now
and I'll never complain about you again.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:04.361
Please.

1:12:34.516 --> 1:12:35.726
Crazy bastard.

1:12:45.819 --> 1:12:46.820
You, military man.

1:12:47.529 --> 1:12:48.739
Nice jump!

1:12:52.576 --> 1:12:53.660
He gets pension if he dies.

1:12:55.329 --> 1:12:57.081
What do you get if you die?

1:13:03.462 --> 1:13:05.464
What?

1:13:07.132 --> 1:13:08.092
Wanna get up here?

1:13:09.510 --> 1:13:10.761
Let me see you try.

1:13:13.764 --> 1:13:15.766
What are you doing?

1:13:22.898 --> 1:13:25.484
I'm right here. Come get me.

1:13:29.405 --> 1:13:30.781
Come get me.

1:13:32.074 --> 1:13:33.283
You son of a bitch.

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:37.413
Come on, man. Come on!

1:13:40.749 --> 1:13:42.042
Come on!

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:00.310
Got scared?

1:14:02.187 --> 1:14:03.480
Who's scared?

1:14:04.356 --> 1:14:05.190
I'm just pissed.

1:14:05.941 --> 1:14:09.611
Most people get red in the face
when they get pissed off.

1:14:10.362 --> 1:14:11.822
But you?

1:14:11.905 --> 1:14:13.157
Your hands are shaking.

1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:15.451
And your face is so pale,
it hurts my eyes.

1:14:17.786 --> 1:14:19.288
You're off this case.

1:14:19.371 --> 1:14:20.497
You could really die.

1:14:21.498 --> 1:14:22.708
-No.
-You could die.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:25.335
-It's my life!
-Crazy bastard, you are not alone!

1:14:25.419 --> 1:14:27.296
If you die, what about your family?

1:14:30.883 --> 1:14:32.009
I get it.

1:14:32.801 --> 1:14:36.680
You and Jun-su are loyal. It's admirable.

1:14:36.763 --> 1:14:39.641
But you've got a family.

1:14:40.517 --> 1:14:41.685
Take your hands off.

1:14:42.186 --> 1:14:44.188
Jun-su is like family to me.

1:14:46.023 --> 1:14:49.193
We grew up like brothers
in the same neighborhood.

1:14:49.902 --> 1:14:51.987
We've never been apart.

1:14:52.988 --> 1:14:54.990
When my mom passed away

1:14:57.201 --> 1:14:58.452
and I was in the army

1:15:00.245 --> 1:15:03.499
he was the only one
who came to visit the tomb.

1:15:07.878 --> 1:15:09.296
And you want me to back off?

1:15:13.383 --> 1:15:14.218
Take it.

1:15:27.356 --> 1:15:28.357
I'm on my way.

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.401
No, not a march. Guerrilla training.

1:15:31.485 --> 1:15:33.403
Yeah, okay.

1:15:34.279 --> 1:15:36.156
Guerrilla training
for civilian defense training?

1:15:36.782 --> 1:15:38.909
What's the general headquarters then?
The silver home?

1:15:38.992 --> 1:15:41.620
There are manners to be kept
even for lies.

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:46.083
Treat your wife half as well
as you treat your friend, you asshole.

1:15:49.795 --> 1:15:51.713
DEAREST WIFE

1:15:53.674 --> 1:15:54.508
END CALL

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:56.969
Anyway, good job.

1:15:57.678 --> 1:15:59.346
I'll see you at Jun-su's trial.

1:15:59.429 --> 1:16:00.264
Come on!

1:16:01.807 --> 1:16:02.766
Hyeongnim!

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:04.434
Hyeong!

1:16:05.435 --> 1:16:06.728
SHARK HYEONGNIM

1:16:10.524 --> 1:16:13.026
-Please leave a message after the beep.
-Seriously.

1:16:13.694 --> 1:16:17.072
People who don't know me
call me a man-eating shark.

1:16:18.574 --> 1:16:21.785
But you guys know what I'm really like.

1:16:21.868 --> 1:16:22.953
Of course.

1:16:23.704 --> 1:16:26.873
You're the only detective
who treats us like people.

1:16:28.750 --> 1:16:32.087
That's why I need to ask you for a favor.

1:16:34.381 --> 1:16:35.591
LEE YU-NO
AGE 27, BLOOD-TYPE B

1:16:36.341 --> 1:16:38.093
GEOJE-DO SASHIMI
JEONGCHONGDONG TIGER

1:16:40.053 --> 1:16:41.096
GROUP CHAT, 43 PARTICIPANTS

1:16:52.858 --> 1:16:54.985
Two bastards. Lee Yu-no.

1:16:55.068 --> 1:16:57.029
JUN-SU'S TRIAL D-3
YANG MIN-AH'S MURDER MOTIVE…

1:16:57.112 --> 1:16:58.322
Who's the other one?

1:16:59.114 --> 1:17:00.741
TRAP!!!
PLANNED

1:17:00.824 --> 1:17:02.159
How did he know?

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:04.411
How'd he know we'd be coming?

1:17:11.168 --> 1:17:12.002
No way.

1:17:13.378 --> 1:17:14.630
LEE YU-NO & WHO?
…REVENGE AGAINST DETECTIVE MA

1:17:14.713 --> 1:17:15.589
What you up to?

1:17:18.258 --> 1:17:19.092
Hi.

1:17:20.594 --> 1:17:22.346
-What?
-This week's living expense.

1:17:23.889 --> 1:17:25.182
Living expense, now.

1:17:26.725 --> 1:17:27.726
Living expenses…

1:17:29.936 --> 1:17:31.229
Didn't I give you yesterday?

1:17:32.272 --> 1:17:33.607
You gave me nothing.

1:17:38.278 --> 1:17:39.821
Oh, I put it in my clothes by mistake.

1:17:40.781 --> 1:17:42.491
Look in my clothes from yesterday.

1:17:43.075 --> 1:17:44.368
The military uniform?

1:17:45.035 --> 1:17:46.995
Yeah, in the cargo pocket.

1:17:48.121 --> 1:17:50.624
-Okay. Bye.
-Yeah.

1:18:06.890 --> 1:18:08.600
Hi, can you keep her for a second?

1:18:12.604 --> 1:18:13.730
Farewell.

1:18:13.814 --> 1:18:15.649
Must've been quite desperate.

1:18:15.732 --> 1:18:17.025
You love those.

1:18:17.984 --> 1:18:20.737
Were you gonna sell those
to give me the living expense?

1:18:21.905 --> 1:18:23.323
What are you talking about?

1:18:24.282 --> 1:18:25.909
I became an idiot thanks to you.

1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:29.955
I said my husband gets guerrilla training
at the civil defense training

1:18:30.038 --> 1:18:31.665
and I was told to report to the NIS.

1:18:31.748 --> 1:18:33.667
That you might be a spy.

1:18:35.419 --> 1:18:36.378
Tell me.

1:18:36.461 --> 1:18:38.380
What's your excuse this time?

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:43.719
Money in the cargo pocket?

1:18:45.345 --> 1:18:46.179
Let's go.

1:18:47.556 --> 1:18:50.350
Let's go check
if the money's really there.

1:18:50.434 --> 1:18:51.893
Now!

1:18:53.895 --> 1:18:56.481
Do we starve
if I close the store for a few days?

1:18:56.565 --> 1:18:58.108
-Do we starve?
-What?

1:18:58.692 --> 1:19:01.153
Hey, Jun-su was more than a friend to us.

1:19:02.154 --> 1:19:05.532
When we couldn't get a house,
he took out a loan for us.

1:19:05.615 --> 1:19:08.160
When we lost Geon-wu

1:19:08.243 --> 1:19:09.911
who ran around for days?

1:19:10.662 --> 1:19:12.289
But I should sit back and watch?

1:19:12.789 --> 1:19:14.332
Is that what you're telling the kids?

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:17.711
No matter what happens to your friend,
you just take care of yourself.

1:19:17.794 --> 1:19:19.421
To Geon-wu, to Hong-ji?

1:19:19.504 --> 1:19:20.672
Stop being ridiculous.

1:19:20.756 --> 1:19:22.340
Only if you'd been better.

1:19:22.424 --> 1:19:26.511
If you'd been a better father or a husband
this wouldn't be an issue!

1:19:30.599 --> 1:19:31.600
You're right.

1:19:32.309 --> 1:19:35.896
But you know what I thought
watching Yong-gyu go through this?

1:19:36.980 --> 1:19:40.650
Loan sharks and apartment on foreclosure.

1:19:41.818 --> 1:19:44.821
Wife couldn't trust the husband,
so she hid the money under other names.

1:19:45.363 --> 1:19:47.365
It's so upsetting that it makes me mad

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:49.910
but I couldn't talk badly of her.

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:51.620
Why?

1:19:52.329 --> 1:19:53.580
He reminded you of yourself?

1:19:54.122 --> 1:19:57.501
I learned a lot
watching him go through that.

1:19:59.002 --> 1:20:01.755
About what it means
to be a father, a husband.

1:20:01.838 --> 1:20:03.507
What I've done wrong so far.

1:20:04.841 --> 1:20:07.302
I know you don't trust me
but I'm gonna change.

1:20:07.886 --> 1:20:08.720
I…

1:20:10.263 --> 1:20:12.766
I wanna be a cool dad
and a good husband. Damn it.

1:20:17.896 --> 1:20:19.189
But Mi-ok.

1:20:21.107 --> 1:20:23.401
Just give me a few more days,
one last time.

1:20:24.861 --> 1:20:25.737
One last time.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:31.117
I don't know.

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:33.662
I really don't know.

1:20:35.163 --> 1:20:37.624
I don't know. Do as you wish.

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:41.545
I don't care if you come home
or if you go investigate.

1:20:42.462 --> 1:20:43.505
It's your choice.

1:20:49.678 --> 1:20:50.512
Sorry.

1:20:53.723 --> 1:20:54.891
But I mean it.

1:20:57.310 --> 1:20:59.938
This is my last bad act, Mi-ok.

1:21:00.981 --> 1:21:02.858
Hey, say that again.

1:21:02.941 --> 1:21:04.901
You got an hour?

1:21:04.985 --> 1:21:08.113
Lee Yu-no's going to be Otari
at the Ttukseom Seoul Forest today.

1:21:08.196 --> 1:21:10.198
Oda… what? What are you talking about?

1:21:10.282 --> 1:21:12.993
-I'm sending some of my men. Don't worry--
-Hang up!

1:21:16.705 --> 1:21:17.581
Detective Noh?

1:21:17.664 --> 1:21:19.624
It's Detective Hwang.

1:21:19.708 --> 1:21:21.835
Who's the guy
that came with you last time?

1:21:22.419 --> 1:21:25.547
He keeps asking me stuff
saying you asked for the information.

1:21:26.172 --> 1:21:28.800
-He's even dropped honorifics--
-Why aren't you answering my calls?

1:21:28.884 --> 1:21:30.927
You, shut up!

1:21:31.011 --> 1:21:33.138
Do you know what Odari is?

1:21:33.221 --> 1:21:35.682
-Odari, my ass.
-It's some cartoon character.

1:21:35.765 --> 1:21:37.767
You mean Otari. From Abyss.

1:21:39.060 --> 1:21:39.895
O…

1:21:41.438 --> 1:21:43.315
You stay right there. I'm on my way.

1:21:49.154 --> 1:21:50.238
I knew this would happen.

1:21:50.322 --> 1:21:52.949
Today's the trial!
What have you been doing!

1:21:53.033 --> 1:21:55.035
That's why I'm on my way to catch him!

1:21:55.994 --> 1:21:58.580
Anyway, why were you
at the police station?

1:21:58.663 --> 1:22:00.874
I found the other guy.

1:22:02.375 --> 1:22:03.209
Who?

1:22:04.044 --> 1:22:06.046
Don't add anything. Just the facts.

1:22:06.129 --> 1:22:08.673
There was another victim.

1:22:13.678 --> 1:22:16.014
The college girl that reported Lee Yu-no
five years ago.

1:22:16.097 --> 1:22:17.098
How'd you figure that out?

1:22:17.182 --> 1:22:19.184
Lee Yu-no came up as a suspect

1:22:19.809 --> 1:22:21.102
but he got out on a strong alibi.

1:22:21.186 --> 1:22:22.312
And?

1:22:22.395 --> 1:22:25.065
The victim's family
insisted the killed was Lee Yu-no.

1:22:25.607 --> 1:22:28.860
And they think the one
who revealed her location to Lee Yu-no

1:22:28.944 --> 1:22:31.029
is Lee Yu-no's arresting officer
from five years ago.

1:22:31.112 --> 1:22:32.405
The arresting officer?

1:22:34.366 --> 1:22:35.241
Detective Ma?

1:22:37.202 --> 1:22:39.371
You think he is crazy?
Why would he sell his witness?

1:22:39.454 --> 1:22:42.082
I haven't met the victim's family
so I can't be sure.

1:22:42.999 --> 1:22:44.250
But the interesting thing

1:22:44.751 --> 1:22:47.253
is that three months
after that girl was killed

1:22:47.337 --> 1:22:50.924
Lee Yu-no and Detective Ma both came up
as suspects for one murder case.

1:22:51.007 --> 1:22:52.842
The Yangjaecheon murder case.

1:22:52.926 --> 1:22:53.843
What?

1:22:53.927 --> 1:22:56.012
I checked with that detective earlier.

1:22:56.096 --> 1:22:57.305
Even the report on Ma.

1:22:57.389 --> 1:22:58.765
When Ma was with the Seocho Police

1:22:58.848 --> 1:23:01.559
he came across Reina
through illegal sex trafficking case.

1:23:01.643 --> 1:23:04.980
What you're saying is
Lee Yu-no and Detective Ma are the perps.

1:23:05.981 --> 1:23:10.068
Yes. Detective Ma is related
to all of the four murder victims.

1:23:10.819 --> 1:23:13.446
He lived in the same apartment
as Han Seo-yeong.

1:23:13.530 --> 1:23:15.573
Yang Min-ah was his wife.

1:23:15.657 --> 1:23:17.617
College girl is the witness of his case.

1:23:18.410 --> 1:23:20.161
-Reina was--
-I don't wanna hear it.

1:23:20.745 --> 1:23:21.579
He's not it.

1:23:23.623 --> 1:23:25.166
Then how did Lee Yu-no set up that trap?

1:23:26.167 --> 1:23:28.420
We went as soon
as we heard from Detective Ma.

1:23:28.503 --> 1:23:30.505
How did Lee Yu-no plant a trap there?

1:23:37.554 --> 1:23:38.513
STUDIO MURDER CASE

1:23:38.596 --> 1:23:41.266
We found a trace of flesh
that appears to belong to the perp

1:23:41.349 --> 1:23:42.851
from the studio victim's teeth.

1:23:42.934 --> 1:23:44.185
According to the DNA analysis

1:23:44.269 --> 1:23:47.105
it belonged to an AB type male
who was not in the registry.

1:23:47.689 --> 1:23:49.607
Can't be Lee Yu-no since he's got record.

1:23:49.691 --> 1:23:52.902
According to you,
Detective Ma has to be blood type AB.

1:23:52.986 --> 1:23:54.112
Without a doubt.

1:23:54.696 --> 1:23:55.864
MA DONG-HUN
BLOOD TYPE O

1:23:55.947 --> 1:23:59.325
The day his wife died, he was on duty.

1:24:00.493 --> 1:24:01.703
What did I tell you?

1:24:01.786 --> 1:24:03.788
You don't catch a perp on a hunch.

1:24:22.265 --> 1:24:23.558
What the hell is this?

1:24:24.350 --> 1:24:25.643
There he is! Otari!

1:24:25.727 --> 1:24:27.729
He's right there.

1:24:31.775 --> 1:24:33.777
You stay right here, got it?

1:24:39.699 --> 1:24:40.533
Get out.

1:24:54.172 --> 1:24:55.006
Get out.

1:24:55.965 --> 1:24:56.800
Hey!

1:24:59.594 --> 1:25:00.553
What the hell?

1:25:04.891 --> 1:25:07.268
-Hyeongnim!
-Get out!

1:25:10.563 --> 1:25:12.649
I knew this would happen.

1:25:15.610 --> 1:25:16.486
Get out.

1:25:21.241 --> 1:25:23.076
Out of my way!

1:25:25.870 --> 1:25:26.704
I'm sorry.

1:25:31.835 --> 1:25:33.837
Stop right there!

1:25:35.839 --> 1:25:37.966
You bastard!

1:25:43.513 --> 1:25:44.639
Catch him!

1:25:47.433 --> 1:25:48.601
Stop, you bastard!

1:25:58.403 --> 1:25:59.821
Push, you bastards!

1:25:59.904 --> 1:26:00.780
Push!

1:26:15.420 --> 1:26:16.921
Stop, you bastard!

1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:25.054
Hey!

1:26:29.309 --> 1:26:31.144
Stop, you bastard!

1:26:45.533 --> 1:26:46.826
Hey!

1:26:50.038 --> 1:26:51.080
You bastard!

1:26:51.748 --> 1:26:53.583
Shit! Let go!

1:26:53.666 --> 1:26:54.834
What?

1:27:07.931 --> 1:27:09.098
Son of a bitch!

1:27:17.023 --> 1:27:19.859
What kind of a cop doesn't check that?

1:27:19.943 --> 1:27:21.319
-I did, too, check.
-And?

1:27:21.903 --> 1:27:24.113
Why didn't you know
he had the ankle monitor?

1:27:25.531 --> 1:27:27.825
It doesn't make sense to me either,
so shut the fuck up.

1:27:27.909 --> 1:27:29.786
Man-eating shark, my ass!

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:32.705
It's a wonder you survived this far
working like this!

1:27:32.789 --> 1:27:33.665
PROBATION OFFICE

1:27:33.748 --> 1:27:35.250
I forgot police is a government office.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:37.335
Fucking government role
just doesn't suit me.

1:27:38.461 --> 1:27:40.255
He's on the target list
for ankle monitoring

1:27:40.338 --> 1:27:42.674
and they put it on him last month.

1:27:42.757 --> 1:27:44.676
How come it doesn't appear
on the police database?

1:27:45.510 --> 1:27:47.136
Well, you see…

1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:49.389
there was restructuring
in the Ministry of Justice

1:27:49.472 --> 1:27:52.392
so it's been hectic
in the probation office too.

1:27:53.309 --> 1:27:55.395
I'll make sure it's updated today.

1:27:55.478 --> 1:27:57.772
Fucking government administration.

1:27:59.357 --> 1:28:01.651
Who's Lee Yu-no's probation officer?

1:28:01.734 --> 1:28:02.568
Hold on.

1:28:03.278 --> 1:28:05.697
Last month.
That's before these two cases occurred.

1:28:06.739 --> 1:28:08.199
So his location is recorded, right?

1:28:10.076 --> 1:28:11.869
Game over, son of a bitch.

1:28:13.079 --> 1:28:14.205
Checkmate.

1:28:21.170 --> 1:28:22.005
Hello?

1:28:22.088 --> 1:28:23.464
Coming to the trial later?

1:28:23.965 --> 1:28:24.799
I'll be there.

1:28:26.175 --> 1:28:28.469
You sound more confident that I thought.

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:31.222
Got yourself a security job somewhere?

1:28:33.182 --> 1:28:34.600
Yeah, I got one for you too.

1:28:34.684 --> 1:28:35.560
Bastard.

1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:41.524
Lee Yu-no's GPS record, please.

1:28:43.526 --> 1:28:46.279
-The dates?
-April 3rd and April 14th.

1:28:46.362 --> 1:28:47.739
MONITORED SUBJECT SEARCH

1:28:47.822 --> 1:28:48.740
Location of crime?

1:28:48.823 --> 1:28:51.075
Seongbuk-gu, Donam-dong, Hanjin Apartment.

1:28:54.662 --> 1:28:55.496
That's right.

1:28:59.917 --> 1:29:01.419
He was in Donam-dong

1:29:02.754 --> 1:29:04.297
but not at Hanjin Apartment.

1:29:05.381 --> 1:29:06.466
What do you mean?

1:29:06.549 --> 1:29:08.051
He just passed by it.

1:29:08.134 --> 1:29:09.052
Look.

1:29:09.761 --> 1:29:12.638
What's the time interval
on this tracking device?

1:29:12.722 --> 1:29:13.556
Ten minutes.

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:15.892
Let me change to one minute.

1:29:20.897 --> 1:29:21.898
Still the same.

1:29:26.277 --> 1:29:28.905
Is it possible
he cut off the ankle monitor?

1:29:28.988 --> 1:29:32.075
As soon as he does,
the control center gets the report.

1:29:32.158 --> 1:29:33.117
That'd be impossible.

1:29:33.201 --> 1:29:35.536
Let's check April 14th for now.

1:29:36.162 --> 1:29:39.707
Location of crime
is Seongbuk-gu, Anam-dong. Right?

1:29:44.379 --> 1:29:48.091
He was in Incheon on April 14th.

1:29:51.511 --> 1:29:52.512
No way.

1:29:57.975 --> 1:30:01.020
The defendant's shirt
found with the murder weapon.

1:30:01.145 --> 1:30:03.981
The apartment purchased
in defendant's name with victim's money.

1:30:04.065 --> 1:30:05.817
Given the evidence

1:30:05.900 --> 1:30:08.694
there is no doubt that defendant
Lee Jun-su is the culprit of this case.

1:30:08.778 --> 1:30:11.614
The fact
that he was an active police officer

1:30:11.697 --> 1:30:13.783
and a long time friend
of the victim's husband

1:30:14.283 --> 1:30:17.703
goes against the social norms
and is considered especially heinous.

1:30:17.787 --> 1:30:22.458
The court orders 30 years in prison
to the defendant, Lee Jun-su.

1:30:24.252 --> 1:30:25.586
DEFENDANT

1:30:46.941 --> 1:30:47.817
It's not me!

1:30:48.568 --> 1:30:49.485
I didn't kill her!

1:30:50.486 --> 1:30:52.405
I didn't kill her. You trust me, right?

1:30:53.322 --> 1:30:55.158
How could I kill her?

1:30:55.241 --> 1:30:56.701
How could I kill her?

1:30:57.410 --> 1:30:58.411
Yong-gyu!

1:30:59.328 --> 1:31:00.496
It's not me!

1:31:00.580 --> 1:31:03.166
-Follow me.
-Let go of me!

1:31:03.249 --> 1:31:06.002
-Let go! Yong-gyu!
-You're a pro at playing losing cards.

1:31:06.711 --> 1:31:07.712
Take a good look.

1:31:09.255 --> 1:31:12.467
This is what happens
when you don't know how to act your age.

1:31:14.802 --> 1:31:15.636
Detective Noh.

1:31:16.554 --> 1:31:18.639
You should've gone looking for junk food.

1:31:18.723 --> 1:31:20.808
Instead of shooting for the stars.

1:31:24.145 --> 1:31:26.689
Promise is a promise.

1:31:27.231 --> 1:31:29.233
Return your things by tomorrow.

1:31:35.281 --> 1:31:36.157
Thirty years.

1:31:37.116 --> 1:31:38.326
Thirty years?

1:31:42.246 --> 1:31:44.248
How could he not be the perp?

1:31:48.419 --> 1:31:49.879
Say something, will you!

1:31:53.216 --> 1:31:55.843
Where are you going?

1:31:57.845 --> 1:32:00.681
Let's go get Lee Yu-no.
He must know something.

1:32:13.569 --> 1:32:16.155
THIS IS PROBATION OFFICER KIM JU-HYEON.
LEE YU-NO APPROACHING DONGJAK BRIDGE.

1:32:22.578 --> 1:32:24.163
What are we missing?

1:32:31.754 --> 1:32:34.048
Those two really aren't it?

1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:36.551
Why did the perp tell us the time?

1:32:37.301 --> 1:32:38.135
MONDAY
1:05 AM

1:32:38.636 --> 1:32:39.470
Why?

1:32:54.485 --> 1:32:55.319
What if…

1:32:55.778 --> 1:32:57.113
there are more than two culprits?

1:33:00.032 --> 1:33:01.284
PERSONS IN CUSTODY
HOMICIDE TEAM 1,DETECTIVE MA DONG-HUN

1:33:04.453 --> 1:33:07.039
Other tutors are working weekends
to get more students to join.

1:33:07.123 --> 1:33:09.458
And here you are
missing all these lessons.

1:33:09.542 --> 1:33:11.502
I know it's hard being a working mom

1:33:11.586 --> 1:33:13.671
but if you can't afford to work,
focus on your kids.

1:33:13.754 --> 1:33:15.423
I think that's best for everyone.

1:33:15.506 --> 1:33:17.925
Detective Conan is playing now.

1:33:19.385 --> 1:33:20.219
So?

1:33:21.929 --> 1:33:23.306
Why isn't dad coming home?

1:33:23.931 --> 1:33:25.433
We need to watch it together.

1:33:36.068 --> 1:33:36.944
ELECTRICITY BILL

1:33:40.323 --> 1:33:41.907
This is brilliant.

1:33:42.408 --> 1:33:45.369
I just looked
at Detective Ma's arrestee list

1:33:45.453 --> 1:33:47.872
and went over
all the cases in my head again.

1:33:49.624 --> 1:33:51.917
If this case was in a mystery fiction

1:33:52.001 --> 1:33:54.045
what would the hidden truth be?

1:33:54.879 --> 1:33:56.047
So, what's the truth?

1:33:56.130 --> 1:33:58.341
To tell you the ending first,
one more victim dies.

1:33:59.425 --> 1:34:01.469
-What?
-Tonight.

1:34:05.598 --> 1:34:06.974
Han Tae-wung.

1:34:07.058 --> 1:34:08.017
-He dies?
-His wife.

1:34:08.100 --> 1:34:08.934
REMARRIED
STEPFATHER, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

1:34:10.478 --> 1:34:13.189
I figured out why they were telling us
the time of the crime.

1:34:13.272 --> 1:34:17.443
The two cases here, college girl,
and Reina's case are all separate cases.

1:34:18.152 --> 1:34:23.366
Except one of the perps overlap in all
and led all of these murders.

1:34:23.449 --> 1:34:24.784
Who's that?

1:34:25.493 --> 1:34:26.327
Detective Ma.

1:34:29.163 --> 1:34:30.039
Him, again?

1:34:30.122 --> 1:34:31.707
Do you know about exchange murder?

1:34:32.458 --> 1:34:33.292
Exchange murder?

1:34:33.376 --> 1:34:35.878
It's one of the tricks
used in mystery fictions.

1:34:36.379 --> 1:34:38.714
You exchange
the people you want to murder.

1:34:38.798 --> 1:34:42.593
For example, Lee Yu-no wants to kill
the college girl who reported him

1:34:42.677 --> 1:34:44.428
but he can't do it. Why?

1:34:44.512 --> 1:34:47.139
He knows he'll be
the first on the suspect list

1:34:47.223 --> 1:34:49.934
if the girl is to be killed.

1:34:50.017 --> 1:34:52.561
Then somebody suggests exchange murder.

1:34:52.645 --> 1:34:56.899
"I'll kill the girl for you,
so you go and make a secure alibi."

1:34:56.982 --> 1:34:59.944
"And then kill someone else for me later."

1:35:00.027 --> 1:35:02.697
And Detective Ma suggested this to him?

1:35:02.780 --> 1:35:06.200
He took time of out of his busy schedule
to call a foreign working girl many times.

1:35:06.283 --> 1:35:08.703
Preventing sex trafficking?

1:35:08.786 --> 1:35:11.747
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
He was having an affair.

1:35:13.332 --> 1:35:16.877
The husband has been seeing
an escort girl for years.

1:35:20.464 --> 1:35:21.757
Let's say that's true.

1:35:21.841 --> 1:35:25.177
A year later,
he plans another exchange murder.

1:35:25.928 --> 1:35:26.762
Why?

1:35:27.346 --> 1:35:29.014
To kill his wife who was having an affair.

1:35:30.641 --> 1:35:33.686
But why did they leave us the time?

1:35:33.769 --> 1:35:36.814
Once I have the answer,
it's crystal clear.

1:35:37.773 --> 1:35:40.609
The purpose of exchange murder
is to create an alibi.

1:35:40.693 --> 1:35:42.153
To take advantage of the alibi--

1:35:42.236 --> 1:35:44.321
They needed to slip the time to the cops.

1:35:44.947 --> 1:35:46.991
The exact time of the murder.

1:35:48.743 --> 1:35:52.204
Two exchange murders
within a timeframe of a year?

1:35:52.997 --> 1:35:53.831
Fine.

1:35:55.124 --> 1:35:57.960
-You said there's another murder tonight?
-Yes.

1:35:58.043 --> 1:36:00.379
Han Seo-yeong and Yang Min-ah
are already dead.

1:36:00.463 --> 1:36:03.924
If it really is an exchange,
the deal is done and over with.

1:36:04.008 --> 1:36:06.802
-Why would there be another one?
-That's what we missed.

1:36:06.886 --> 1:36:09.680
We limited our perps to two guys
and that messed us up.

1:36:10.264 --> 1:36:13.434
Because this is an exchange murder
between three people.

1:36:14.143 --> 1:36:15.644
Three perps, three victims.

1:36:15.728 --> 1:36:19.982
They commited the crime in pairs
and the other one came up with an alibi.

1:36:20.065 --> 1:36:21.525
Enough with your bullshit!

1:36:21.609 --> 1:36:24.153
Why would there be three
when they only need two?

1:36:34.413 --> 1:36:36.582
He dropped the body in the river
by mistake.

1:36:37.249 --> 1:36:39.418
Faced an unexpected witness.

1:36:40.586 --> 1:36:42.588
Left his hair
in the process of killing the witness.

1:36:42.671 --> 1:36:47.009
So they worked in a pair
for flawless exchange murder?

1:36:47.092 --> 1:36:52.473
Yes. It would be impossible for an amateur
to work the murders alone.

1:36:52.556 --> 1:36:55.059
Stop it.
It's so pathetic I can't hear it anymore.

1:36:55.142 --> 1:36:56.185
Aren't you curious?

1:36:56.852 --> 1:36:59.355
The two new recruits of Detective Ma?

1:37:01.148 --> 1:37:01.982
One is Jang Ho.

1:37:02.775 --> 1:37:04.026
The witness?

1:37:04.610 --> 1:37:08.239
The other one is Han Tae-wung
that I showed you earlier.

1:37:08.322 --> 1:37:09.156
Nah.

1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:10.199
It's him.

1:37:10.282 --> 1:37:11.200
Name, Han Tae-wung.

1:37:11.283 --> 1:37:12.117
Age, 42.

1:37:12.201 --> 1:37:14.829
He assaulted the wife and the stepson

1:37:15.496 --> 1:37:17.998
claiming the wife
met her ex-husband frequently.

1:37:23.087 --> 1:37:24.672
Shut your mouth from now on.

1:37:27.174 --> 1:37:30.302
How could you think such a loser
could be our perp?

1:37:32.304 --> 1:37:33.931
LEE YU-NO, APPROACHING ROUTE 46
TOWARDS CHUNCHEON

1:37:37.351 --> 1:37:38.853
For an exchange murder to work--

1:37:38.936 --> 1:37:40.187
I told you to shut up.

1:37:40.271 --> 1:37:43.190
One needs to know the desire to murder
in another person.

1:37:44.650 --> 1:37:49.905
In other words, it's obvious why Ma
chose his partners from the arrestee list.

1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:55.578
From the list,
Han Tae-wung is the only AB-type.

1:37:55.661 --> 1:37:58.831
That's all you have
to put him as a suspect?

1:37:58.914 --> 1:38:01.876
He had the motive, was accessible.

1:38:01.959 --> 1:38:06.171
There'd be no better exchange partner
than him to Detective Ma.

1:38:06.755 --> 1:38:11.760
He got in the holding cell
the day after Ma's wife was killed.

1:38:12.761 --> 1:38:13.846
Lee Yu-no is just the tail.

1:38:14.638 --> 1:38:16.682
Han Tae-wung lives in Bomun-dong.

1:38:16.765 --> 1:38:17.766
Pull a uey here.

1:38:18.601 --> 1:38:19.727
I said U-turn!

1:38:20.561 --> 1:38:24.481
Tonight could be
my last night as a detective.

1:38:24.565 --> 1:38:27.651
And we still have a shot
at solving the case.

1:38:28.652 --> 1:38:31.864
You want me to believe
some mystery fiction now?

1:38:32.406 --> 1:38:33.490
Crazy bastard.

1:38:33.574 --> 1:38:36.911
Look, Han Tae-wung's
warrant validity examination is tomorrow.

1:38:36.994 --> 1:38:39.914
His wife dies tonight
and he gets out of the cell tomorrow.

1:38:41.790 --> 1:38:43.334
Isn't that the most perfect alibi?

1:38:44.835 --> 1:38:46.837
Please, we are running out of time!

1:38:47.796 --> 1:38:50.591
If you miss this case,
who's gonna set it right?

1:38:50.674 --> 1:38:54.303
My friend, your partner, was framed
and is looking at 30 years!

1:38:55.304 --> 1:38:56.764
Fine. Tell me.

1:38:58.432 --> 1:39:01.977
Who's gonna be the killer tonight?

1:39:02.645 --> 1:39:05.564
Han Tae-wung's in holding,
so it has to be Detective Ma and Jang Ho.

1:39:06.607 --> 1:39:07.608
Who killed Ma's wife?

1:39:07.691 --> 1:39:08.984
Jang Ho and Han Tae-wung.

1:39:10.110 --> 1:39:11.070
Who killed Seo-yeong?

1:39:11.153 --> 1:39:12.613
Ma and Han, for sure!

1:39:13.614 --> 1:39:16.200
Answer my question and I'll turn the car.

1:39:16.283 --> 1:39:18.118
If you can't answer, you're getting out.

1:39:18.202 --> 1:39:19.370
Fine, what is it?

1:39:19.453 --> 1:39:21.497
Why was Jang Ho at the crime scene?

1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:23.207
The witness identified Jang Ho.

1:39:23.999 --> 1:39:26.543
What was he doing there
when he should be making up an alibi?

1:39:26.627 --> 1:39:29.129
And just an hour before the murder. Why?

1:39:29.213 --> 1:39:30.923
Why was he there? Tell me.

1:39:31.006 --> 1:39:32.508
Why can't you answer?

1:39:32.591 --> 1:39:33.425
Let me think.

1:39:33.509 --> 1:39:35.052
-Why was he there?
-Wait. Let me think!

1:39:39.264 --> 1:39:40.182
Get out.

1:39:41.058 --> 1:39:41.892
Hold on.

1:39:41.976 --> 1:39:42.810
Get out!

1:39:42.893 --> 1:39:43.727
Hold on.

1:39:43.811 --> 1:39:44.853
Son of a…

1:39:47.940 --> 1:39:49.400
Why was he there?

1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:52.903
Get out, now.

1:39:58.534 --> 1:40:00.411
You've done enough. We're through.

1:40:02.246 --> 1:40:03.372
Good work.

1:40:05.624 --> 1:40:06.458
Hyeongnim!

1:40:07.459 --> 1:40:08.293
Also…

1:40:08.919 --> 1:40:09.753
Dae-man.

1:40:09.837 --> 1:40:11.255
Call me.

1:40:12.172 --> 1:40:13.132
I'll buy you soju.

1:40:21.807 --> 1:40:23.267
Nice shot!

1:40:23.851 --> 1:40:26.186
What's going on?

1:40:26.270 --> 1:40:28.564
-A short circuit?
-It's scary.

1:40:30.232 --> 1:40:32.067
Why's this open?

1:40:33.861 --> 1:40:35.237
-Who would--
-Manager!

1:40:36.071 --> 1:40:37.281
I'm gonna get going.

1:40:37.781 --> 1:40:39.742
-Good luck on the field tomorrow.
-Okay.

1:40:43.912 --> 1:40:44.830
You still there?

1:40:46.290 --> 1:40:47.124
What was that?

1:40:52.087 --> 1:40:54.173
Do-ha, mom'll be right back.

1:41:25.204 --> 1:41:26.538
Who's there?

1:41:27.039 --> 1:41:27.956
Is your mom home?

1:41:28.540 --> 1:41:31.710
Mom went to see daddy. The real daddy.

1:41:32.377 --> 1:41:33.420
Where's that?

1:41:33.504 --> 1:41:34.880
When did she leave?

1:41:34.963 --> 1:41:36.215
-It's an emergency. Come to the range now!
-Must it be today? Looks like it'll rain.

1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:41.637
KAKAOTALK
NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:42.554

1:41:42.679 --> 1:41:44.306

-Must it be today? Looks like it'll rain.

DO-HA'S DAD: IT'S URGENT. COME ASAP!!

1:42:00.948 --> 1:42:01.990
Lady!

1:42:03.575 --> 1:42:04.785
Hold on!

1:42:11.750 --> 1:42:12.751
Stop!

1:42:16.088 --> 1:42:17.381
Are you out of your mind?

1:42:17.464 --> 1:42:18.423
U-turn, please!

1:42:19.049 --> 1:42:21.635
If you're in a rush, take another cab.
I have places to go.

1:42:21.718 --> 1:42:23.720
Just take a U-turn, now!

1:42:23.804 --> 1:42:24.847
Please, U-turn!

1:43:29.745 --> 1:43:32.956
Come on, pick up the phone!

1:43:36.752 --> 1:43:38.420
SHARK HYEONGNIM

1:44:43.652 --> 1:44:44.695
Shit!

1:44:52.744 --> 1:44:54.121
You know, don't you?

1:44:54.705 --> 1:44:55.539
Who is it?

1:44:56.290 --> 1:44:57.833
Who killed the women?

1:45:00.210 --> 1:45:02.170
Who told you to kill me?

1:45:04.298 --> 1:45:05.382
Say it!

1:45:07.259 --> 1:45:09.928
Smiling? When they've caught your tail?

1:45:10.512 --> 1:45:12.097
Hey, froggie.

1:45:12.180 --> 1:45:14.808
You've gotta clean up after your own mess.

1:45:15.976 --> 1:45:19.187
If this fails, I'm gonna kill you.

1:45:48.550 --> 1:45:50.552
Hey, are you okay?

1:46:12.366 --> 1:46:13.367
Yong-gyu.

1:46:13.867 --> 1:46:14.701
Dae-man.

1:46:17.537 --> 1:46:19.164
Dae-man, it's been a while.

1:46:19.247 --> 1:46:20.540
Hi, what's up?

1:46:20.624 --> 1:46:21.583
I was drinking.

1:46:22.501 --> 1:46:23.335
With who?

1:46:24.252 --> 1:46:25.295
Me.

1:46:25.379 --> 1:46:27.422
-Get out.
-I drank with him.

1:46:27.506 --> 1:46:29.800
-Stop it and leave.
-He drank with me!

1:46:29.883 --> 1:46:31.676
It wasn't Jang Ho. It was Yong-gyu.

1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:33.011
Building 201, please.

1:46:33.095 --> 1:46:35.097
He used me to create an alibi.

1:46:35.931 --> 1:46:37.391
Just one more drink, Dae-man.

1:46:38.850 --> 1:46:41.478
When a wife dies,
the killer is the husband.

1:46:42.771 --> 1:46:45.357
YU SEON-HYE, SONG DO-HA, HAN TAE-WUNG
BIOLOGICAL MOTHER, REMARRIED, STEPFATHER

1:46:46.942 --> 1:46:47.776
What…

1:46:49.528 --> 1:46:51.238
What have you done?

1:46:54.741 --> 1:46:56.284
What have you done, fuck!

1:47:04.042 --> 1:47:04.876
You came alone.

1:47:09.548 --> 1:47:12.551
Alone? There are cops everywhere outside.

1:47:13.135 --> 1:47:17.139
Yong-gyu. If this is gonna be fair,
you need to get blood on your hand, too.

1:47:18.181 --> 1:47:19.683
Wake up and kill her now.

1:47:20.350 --> 1:47:21.268
I'll take care of him.

1:47:22.811 --> 1:47:24.729
Go on. Kill her.

1:47:27.732 --> 1:47:28.567
Don't kill me.

1:47:29.568 --> 1:47:30.777
The cops are outside.

1:47:30.861 --> 1:47:31.820
Where?

1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:35.365
Where?

1:47:37.492 --> 1:47:38.743
I'm the cop.

1:47:38.827 --> 1:47:40.162
No, Yong-gyu!

1:48:00.515 --> 1:48:01.391
Did you see that?

1:48:02.267 --> 1:48:03.310
It's not much.

1:48:03.810 --> 1:48:05.145
It's no use regretting now.

1:48:06.229 --> 1:48:08.482
We're on an irrevocable journey together.

1:48:09.941 --> 1:48:11.359
Remember.

1:48:11.443 --> 1:48:13.361
We're not killing someone else's wife.

1:48:14.029 --> 1:48:15.906
We're killing our own wives
for having an affair.

1:48:16.865 --> 1:48:19.659
The wives who betrayed us
and were having an affair.

1:48:22.329 --> 1:48:24.956
Help. Who are you?

1:48:26.166 --> 1:48:27.125
-Help!
-Yeah.

1:48:27.709 --> 1:48:30.337
Let's finish off this fucking journey now!

1:48:35.008 --> 1:48:35.842
Why?

1:48:35.926 --> 1:48:37.177
Why'd you do it?

1:48:40.222 --> 1:48:41.056
Oh, man.

1:48:47.103 --> 1:48:49.981
-Hello!
-Welcome.

1:48:52.817 --> 1:48:53.693
Busy?

1:48:58.240 --> 1:48:59.157
JUN-SU

1:48:59.241 --> 1:49:01.243
I knew all about it.

1:49:01.326 --> 1:49:03.828
I knew they were meeting secretly

1:49:04.454 --> 1:49:08.667
and bought an apartment to live together
under Jun-su's name.

1:49:08.750 --> 1:49:11.545
Yong-gyu! Do you not know Jun-su?

1:49:12.754 --> 1:49:15.549
That bastard was doing it all for you!

1:49:16.091 --> 1:49:18.510
He convinced her not to file for a divorce

1:49:18.593 --> 1:49:21.680
and was holding onto the money
until your debt was settled.

1:49:21.763 --> 1:49:23.139
Shut up, you bastard!

1:49:23.223 --> 1:49:26.393
-What do you know!
-Bullshit.

1:49:31.898 --> 1:49:33.108
You know what this is?

1:49:34.192 --> 1:49:35.819
Son of a bitch, you're too loud.

1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:40.282
Why?

1:49:41.032 --> 1:49:41.866
What?

1:49:44.578 --> 1:49:46.329
What are you to intervene, bastard?

1:49:46.913 --> 1:49:48.164
Hey, are you crazy?

1:49:48.957 --> 1:49:50.375
You wanna die. Is that it?

1:49:54.504 --> 1:49:55.797
Let go.

1:49:57.549 --> 1:49:59.676
This is one crazy bastard.

1:49:59.759 --> 1:50:00.594
Yong-gyu.

1:50:01.344 --> 1:50:04.556
Jun-su wanted me to give that to you.

1:50:05.557 --> 1:50:06.725
Jun-su, that bastard

1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:11.688
was only worried about you
even while he was in jail.

1:50:13.607 --> 1:50:16.401
Shut up, son of a bitch!

1:50:22.616 --> 1:50:25.327
No night is forever, no rain everlasting
I wish the same for my veiled truth

1:50:29.205 --> 1:50:30.332
What are you doing?

1:50:32.375 --> 1:50:34.794
Hurry and kill the woman and leave,
you fucking loser!

1:50:36.212 --> 1:50:39.049
Instead of the ex-husband,
you'll get the blame.

1:50:40.133 --> 1:50:41.468
Don't do it!

1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:51.853
Actually, change of plans.

1:50:51.936 --> 1:50:55.565
You two were raping the woman
and died together.

1:50:56.149 --> 1:50:57.192
An amicable ending.

1:50:57.275 --> 1:50:58.777
Crazy bastard.

1:51:02.113 --> 1:51:03.114
Yong-gyu!

1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:37.774
You all right?

1:51:39.317 --> 1:51:40.443
How'd you find here?

1:51:42.821 --> 1:51:45.115
Because I'm a veteran.

1:51:56.042 --> 1:51:58.044
Have you heard of exchange murder?

1:51:58.128 --> 1:52:00.672
What was once imagined
only possible in mystery fiction

1:52:00.755 --> 1:52:01.923
happened in real life.

1:52:02.006 --> 1:52:03.675
What do you think of the comment

1:52:03.758 --> 1:52:07.011
that this is the worst crime committed
by an active police officer?

1:52:07.095 --> 1:52:10.348
Are you using police discretion on him?
How will you protect the people's safety?

1:52:10.432 --> 1:52:11.933
-Are you resigning?
-Please answer.

1:52:12.016 --> 1:52:13.768
How will you take responsibility?

1:52:13.852 --> 1:52:16.771
Who put in Lee Jun-su
instead of Ma Dong-hun?

1:52:17.439 --> 1:52:18.273
Who is it!

1:52:20.108 --> 1:52:21.276
You bastard.

1:52:21.359 --> 1:52:23.611
Where's your resignation letter?

1:52:23.695 --> 1:52:24.529
Well?

1:52:24.612 --> 1:52:25.572
Damn you!

1:52:32.162 --> 1:52:35.248
Why do we keep seeing murder cases
between married couples?

1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:37.667
What's most shocking about this case

1:52:37.751 --> 1:52:40.128
is that three husbands
arranged an exchange murder

1:52:40.211 --> 1:52:41.421
to kill their wives…

1:52:41.504 --> 1:52:43.131
…and an active police officer was…

1:52:43.214 --> 1:52:44.841
Crazy bastards!

1:52:44.924 --> 1:52:48.219
Don't they have better things to do
than to go fucking kill their wives?

1:52:48.303 --> 1:52:49.721
-Women are weak!
-You watch out.

1:52:50.722 --> 1:52:54.934
Most guys that kill their wives
are losers like that.

1:52:55.018 --> 1:52:56.186
Speak for yourself.

1:52:57.103 --> 1:52:58.438
I'm a new man now.

1:52:59.522 --> 1:53:01.441
I'm going to the bathroom.
Peel an orange for me.

1:53:05.195 --> 1:53:08.323
Take care. I'm leaving.

1:53:08.406 --> 1:53:09.866
What a great couple.

1:53:09.949 --> 1:53:11.868
Yeah, we are newly weds.

1:53:11.951 --> 1:53:12.952
I see.

1:53:16.456 --> 1:53:17.290
You know…

1:53:17.916 --> 1:53:19.250
-What?
-Nothing.

1:53:19.751 --> 1:53:20.627
It's nothing.

1:53:21.127 --> 1:53:21.961
What is it?

1:53:22.504 --> 1:53:27.926
I'm thinking about quitting detective
to open up a private investigator office.

1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:31.304
Wanna join?

1:53:34.599 --> 1:53:35.767
A private investigator office?

1:53:35.850 --> 1:53:39.103
With my skills and your stories,
we might hit a jackpot.

1:53:40.230 --> 1:53:41.689
But why would you quit detective?

1:53:41.773 --> 1:53:45.235
I'm not proud
of taking over the job of my junior.

1:53:46.110 --> 1:53:47.737
Kinda fed up
with organizational structure.

1:53:47.821 --> 1:53:49.697
Plus, it pays next to nothing.

1:53:51.741 --> 1:53:54.536
-Never mind if you aren't up for it.
-No, that's not it.

1:53:56.704 --> 1:53:58.039
Will our wives let us?

1:53:59.541 --> 1:54:00.583
Did you get her approval?

1:54:01.417 --> 1:54:02.252
Well…

1:54:04.754 --> 1:54:05.839
I gotta fight for it.

1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:07.715
Well then…

1:54:09.008 --> 1:54:10.009
Same goes for me.

1:54:22.522 --> 1:54:23.690
It's hard to peel, isn't it?

1:54:26.234 --> 1:54:27.068
There we go.

1:54:27.902 --> 1:54:29.487
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

1:54:29.571 --> 1:54:31.573
Get in here, now!

1:54:33.199 --> 1:54:35.201
I was gonna go for divorce by consent

1:54:35.285 --> 1:54:36.786
but you give me no choice.

1:54:36.870 --> 1:54:40.123
Fine, I'll see you in court. You got it?

1:54:40.206 --> 1:54:43.459
Please, Mi-ok. Don't do this.

1:54:43.543 --> 1:54:44.836
Let go!

1:54:44.919 --> 1:54:46.462
Come on, give me a chance!

1:54:46.546 --> 1:54:49.132
Why? Do whatever the hell you want to do!

1:54:49.215 --> 1:54:50.258
Isn't that what you want?

1:54:51.593 --> 1:54:55.805
No, Never!
How could I live without you and the kids!

1:54:55.889 --> 1:54:58.099
You crazy bastard! Stop the nonsense!

1:54:58.182 --> 1:55:01.311
I can't sign that.
So, either you trust me or kill me.

1:55:01.394 --> 1:55:02.478
It's your call.

1:55:03.688 --> 1:55:05.356
Fine, I'll kill you.

1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:07.275
How do you wanna die?

1:55:09.152 --> 1:55:11.321
Die! Die, you bastard!

1:55:11.404 --> 1:55:12.572
-Poor thing.
-Oh, no.

1:55:13.323 --> 1:55:15.700
Whoa, that's my dad!

1:55:15.783 --> 1:55:16.743
That's my dad!

1:55:16.826 --> 1:55:20.288
I didn't do anything to deserve
this award for courageous citizen.

1:55:20.371 --> 1:55:21.623
Geon-wu, are you watching?

1:55:21.748 --> 1:55:23.416
-I'm watching!
-I got President's award!

1:55:23.499 --> 1:55:25.418
Geon-wu, Hong-ji. I love you guys!

1:55:25.501 --> 1:55:26.628
-I miss him!
-Mi-ok.

1:55:26.711 --> 1:55:27.545
I love you!

1:55:28.338 --> 1:55:29.547
Let's go, family!

1:55:29.631 --> 1:55:30.506
-Whoa.
-Congrats.

1:55:30.590 --> 1:55:33.343
-Must be so proud.
-Congratulations.

1:55:36.012 --> 1:55:36.846
