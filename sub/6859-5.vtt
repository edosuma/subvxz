<i>Global crisis!</i>

00:18.850 --> 00:21.187
<i>The Mid Rim planet of Aleen
is devastated</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:23.132
<i>by catastrophic earthquakes.</i>

00:23.507 --> 00:25.129
<i>As the people struggle,</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:27.900
<i>the future of the
survivors rests on their ability</i>

00:28.025 --> 00:30.974

00:44.927 --> 00:47.380
<i>Commander Wolffe,
we've been waiting for your report.</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:51.662
We've located clusters of life-forms
on the planet's surface, senator.

00:51.983 --> 00:53.718
There are thousands of survivors.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.326
<i>That is good news.</i>

00:55.640 --> 00:57.765
<i>The aleena will be
very glad to see you.</i>

00:57.933 --> 01:02.700
Yes, my orders are to get the path
to rebuilding and move on.

01:03.116 --> 01:05.678
General plo needs reinforcements
as soon as possible.

01:05.954 --> 01:07.467
<i>Your orders stand.</i>

01:07.900 --> 01:11.165
<i>With hope leave them,
but return to the war, you must.</i>

01:11.478 --> 01:12.446
Yes, sir.

01:12.623 --> 01:14.824
We will start landing
procedures immediatly.

Really?
Must you be so rough?

02:00.329 --> 02:03.747
You think this is rough?
Wait till we get to the surface.

02:03.872 --> 02:05.943
Traipsing through
a natural disaster zone,

02:06.068 --> 02:08.094
is not my kind of diversion, artoo.

02:08.721 --> 02:11.680
You may be game for an adventure.
I certainly am not.

02:12.694 --> 02:15.426
- Suck it up, shiny.
- That will leave a mark.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.166
Great, it's gonna be
another one of those planets.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.738
Okay, who packed
the translator droid?

03:18.049 --> 03:19.048
Hello! Hello!

03:19.173 --> 03:20.616
I'm here, commander.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.441
A local custom, I suppose.
Interesting.

03:39.507 --> 03:41.604
- Did you get that?
- Certainly, I did.

03:42.274 --> 03:45.141
Commander wolffe,
You have the honor of meeting

03:45.309 --> 03:46.934
king Manchucho.

03:47.430 --> 03:49.074
His message, simply put is,

03:49.441 --> 03:51.441
Welcome to our disaster.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.212
Glad you could come.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.101
They will save us
and feed our stomachs.

04:02.326 --> 04:05.327
The gods below will know
peace once more.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.535
They are expressing
gratitude, commander.

04:09.660 --> 04:12.474
The chant is a rather flowery
way of asking,

04:12.599 --> 04:14.017
What's for dinner?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.673
<i>Commander, we're experiencing
some setting from the original event.</i>

04:19.043 --> 04:20.274
It's to be expected.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.088
An aftershock, everyone.

04:22.213 --> 04:24.972
Please, remain calm.
I repeat.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.161
Yes, yes, thank you.
It wasn't actually me,

04:36.286 --> 04:38.250
but thank you anyway.

04:38.683 --> 04:41.018
Trooper squads,
scan for unstable ground.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.762
Mark unsafe areas.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.117
Let's get these cans unloaded.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.052
Access and repair
the mainframe computers is job one.

04:53.428 --> 04:56.148
The R2 unit has uploaded
the republic's reboot manuals,

04:56.273 --> 04:59.693
with instructions on how to make
the equipment we're leaving operational.

05:18.402 --> 05:22.150
They are asking if we would,
"make peace in the ground".

05:22.885 --> 05:24.738
We're good but not that good.

05:24.986 --> 05:25.824
Sinker!

05:25.992 --> 05:28.150
- Commander?
- Take your team, the R2 unit,

05:28.275 --> 05:30.440
and a couple of Aleena
to the mainframe station.

05:30.565 --> 05:32.677
- Let's get them back online.
- On it sir.

05:32.802 --> 05:34.794
All right, little fellas, let's go.

05:48.512 --> 05:50.582
Looks like the rubble
is blocking the entry.

05:50.707 --> 05:51.815
I got this.

05:52.312 --> 05:53.069
Boost!

05:53.194 --> 05:56.007
You want what's left of the place
crashing down on our hands?

05:56.418 --> 05:57.997
You worry too much.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.821
I could have done that.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.275
After you, little guy.

06:23.279 --> 06:25.592
Run metrics on structural
degradation, will you?

06:30.276 --> 06:31.941
Did you find anything?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.389
All right, let's get
the download started.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.870
Another quake.
Coming here was a bad idea.

06:53.173 --> 06:55.248
I'm beginning to agree with you.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.472
{PUB}We've mark areas
for a temporary hospital

07:11.855 --> 07:13.936
and a communal kitchen here.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.941
He is saying, first,
peace must be restored.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.280
We must...

07:33.078 --> 07:35.761
Go inside... Under, inside.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.124
He says, no, to the kitchen.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.043
This is a relief mission.

07:41.448 --> 07:42.286
Indeed.

07:42.632 --> 07:45.626
Perhaps they do not
allow eating in public.

07:51.951 --> 07:53.421
Do I need this?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.699
Here's how it is.
My orders are,

08:00.824 --> 08:02.793
to deliver supplies
and reestablish power,

08:02.918 --> 08:04.464
and communication systems.

08:04.589 --> 08:07.027
Report back to the transport
the moment

08:07.195 --> 08:09.090
that R2 unit has completed
the download.

08:09.842 --> 08:12.192
Tell them we'll be out
of their hair in no time.

08:12.434 --> 08:14.466
Splendid. A firm hand.

08:14.591 --> 08:17.645
Well done, commander,
if I may say, well done.

08:22.555 --> 08:24.350
Download in progress, commander.

08:24.475 --> 08:26.763
<i>Excellent.
Report back to the staging area.</i>

08:26.888 --> 08:28.601
<i>We need all hands on deck.</i>

08:28.828 --> 08:31.065
- <i>The droid can finish up.</i>
- On our way, sir.

08:31.368 --> 08:33.976
All right, artoo, stay here
and monitor the download

08:34.101 --> 08:36.559
And get back to the ship
as soon as possible.

08:39.741 --> 08:42.405
- Watch your step, shiny.
- Impossible clones.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.512
What have we here?

08:52.067 --> 08:53.840
Something to show us?

08:53.965 --> 08:57.161
I see no reason why not,
time permitting, of course.

08:59.571 --> 09:02.318
They're rather impatient
creatures, aren't they?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.389
A little diplomacy goes a long way.

09:05.514 --> 09:09.256
Of course, you wouldn't understand,
but there is no harm in humoring them.

09:15.682 --> 09:17.942
Yes, yes, we're coming.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.103
Artoo, keep your sensor on them,
just in case.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.770
I see. A sacred treasure, indeed,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.003
To be excavated and examined

09:43.128 --> 09:45.250
at a later stage
with the proper equipment.

09:49.479 --> 09:52.049
Better to stay at a safe distance,
thank you.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.103
I have a bad feeling about this.

10:17.891 --> 10:19.829
Artoo, is that you?

10:24.431 --> 10:26.782
I suppose that could have
been worse.

10:37.148 --> 10:38.156
Now it is.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.668
There must be some way out of here.

10:59.094 --> 11:01.967
Sitting floor on this planet
was a mistake in the first place.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.282
<i>We belong on senator
Amidala's balcony,</i>

11:04.407 --> 11:07.439
watching coruscant's
glorious moons rise above

11:07.659 --> 11:09.130
The city of spires...

11:10.243 --> 11:11.330
<i>What was that?</i>

11:11.849 --> 11:14.298
Wait! No! Shut it off.

11:16.900 --> 11:17.851
Daylight.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.247
<i>We're saved!</i>

11:19.625 --> 11:21.549
I knew I would find a way out.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.377
{pos(190,230)}Look, little guy, we're doing
everything we can.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.782
{pos(190,220)}Has anyone seen
the translator droid?

11:56.591 --> 11:59.226
{pos(190,220)}That's fine with me. Whatever.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.034
Did you see that?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.852
It's an ambush!
We're under attack!

12:13.977 --> 12:17.069
Get these bugs off!
Get off! Artoo, help.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.574
Stop! That's quite enough.

12:20.952 --> 12:23.368
Sometimes, artoo, You go too far.

12:23.725 --> 12:26.287
Why have you come?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.542
I believe this tree
is talking to us.

12:38.334 --> 12:41.242
You do not belong.

12:41.772 --> 12:45.145
I heartily agree.
Being here is a terrible mistake.

12:46.083 --> 12:46.764
Go!

12:47.542 --> 12:50.394
<i>Leave us to rest!</i>

12:51.037 --> 12:52.778
We will be happily on our way,

12:52.903 --> 12:55.565
 if you would just
point us in the right direction.

12:55.924 --> 13:02.302
Why have the surface dwellers
destroyed the peace?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.676
To be accurate, the quakes did that.

13:07.495 --> 13:14.213
The ground shakes
to keep out their foul air,

13:14.473 --> 13:18.992
which poisons and destroys us!

13:20.129 --> 13:22.702
The quakes have caused many to die.

13:22.827 --> 13:24.883
That is why we have come to help.

13:25.185 --> 13:26.221
How?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.264
However we can.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.824
There is not much time.

13:31.949 --> 13:35.684
Find what you were sent here to do.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.518
Ask orphne.

13:38.801 --> 13:40.520
She will know.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.654
Yes, yes. On our way
to see orphne directly.

13:44.162 --> 13:45.991
Artoo, let's get out of here.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.816
{PUB}My ocular sensors seem
to be malfunctioning.

14:25.986 --> 14:27.327
Certainly, I remember.

14:27.452 --> 14:30.535
He said, "The surface dwellers
destroyed the peace."

14:31.758 --> 14:32.980
I don't know.

14:33.523 --> 14:34.981
Let's find this orphne.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.357
It seems she has all the answers.

15:04.954 --> 15:06.446
Pardon me, madam.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.685
I can't eat you.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.308
That's a relief.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.707
If you are orphne,
we have come to ask...

15:17.875 --> 15:19.187
How to get back?

15:19.312 --> 15:20.642
Well, yes.

15:20.934 --> 15:22.487
We have lost our way.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.430
There is a covenant,

15:24.555 --> 15:29.641
between the Aleena of old
and our subterranean world.

15:30.353 --> 15:34.688
We survive because
the ground keeps us apart.

15:35.099 --> 15:37.133
- But you are apart.
- No.

15:37.547 --> 15:42.816
The divide was breached
when they attacked our most sacred site.

15:43.736 --> 15:44.746
Attacked?

15:44.871 --> 15:48.621
Without going through
the natural filtering process,

15:48.746 --> 15:52.784
the surface air is deadly to us.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.461
We caused the quakes that followed.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.965
But so many on
the surface have died.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.871
We are not destroyers by nature.

16:02.380 --> 16:06.973
But we must do what is in our
power to seal the breach.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.049
We can seal the breach.
Just tell us where it is.

16:10.174 --> 16:11.205
We can help.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.813
If you have come to help us,

16:13.938 --> 16:15.604
You will help.

16:15.729 --> 16:21.454
If you are meant to return
to the surface, you will find your way.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.466
What?

16:22.801 --> 16:24.482
But this is a dead end.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.559
You can't keep us here.

16:27.684 --> 16:28.987
This is an outrage.

16:29.347 --> 16:32.265
Your destiny is your own.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.316
Perhaps it is through your
desire to survive,

16:36.788 --> 16:40.266
that your greater purpose
will be revelated.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.181
You can run but cannot walk.

16:44.484 --> 16:47.760
You have a mouth but cannot talk.

16:48.214 --> 16:50.759
You have a head but never weep.

16:51.329 --> 16:54.561
You have a bed but never sleep.

16:55.315 --> 16:59.066
Ask yourself, who are you?

17:00.638 --> 17:02.668
Wait! Wait, orphne!
Don't go!

17:06.637 --> 17:08.818
Artoo, we're doomed.

17:10.121 --> 17:11.440
I don't know.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.365
What was the breach
that she spoke of?

17:13.532 --> 17:14.627
What was broken?

17:15.439 --> 17:16.492
Artoo, hurry.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.394
Replay orphne's message.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.275
Yes, riddle.
I know it's a riddle.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.323
That's what we're trying
to figure out...

17:23.448 --> 17:25.001
What the riddle means.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.585
Just play it back, would you?

17:27.025 --> 17:29.900
<i>You can run but cannot walk.</i>

17:30.174 --> 17:33.705
<i>You have a mouth but cannot talk.</i>

17:34.030 --> 17:36.733
<i>You have a head but never weep.</i>

17:37.035 --> 17:39.975
<i>You have a bed but never sleep.</i>

17:40.916 --> 17:43.369
Run but cannot walk, yes.

17:43.978 --> 17:46.432
Have a mouth but cannot talk.</i

17:49.062 --> 17:50.158
Don't worry, R2.

17:50.283 --> 17:51.945
I'll figure it out very soon.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.818
Riddles are my specialty.

17:53.943 --> 17:54.983
Let's see.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.421
Cannot walk.

17:56.546 --> 17:58.535
Mouth but cannot talk.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.288
What? Fire?

18:02.457 --> 18:03.561
It isn't fire.

18:03.798 --> 18:05.140
Let me think.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.663
Soil?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.117
Of course it's not soil.

18:13.531 --> 18:16.028
What are you going on about?
I nearly had it.

18:17.077 --> 18:20.807
Water? Artoo, will you stop
your mumbling and let me think?

18:21.842 --> 18:24.102
What are you doing now?
This is no time to clean up.

18:24.448 --> 18:25.788
All this water...

18:26.026 --> 18:27.730
I detest getting wet.

18:31.266 --> 18:33.069
Water, water.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.617
A river! A river!
Artoo, it's a river!

18:35.742 --> 18:39.180
That's it! I have figured it out.
It is a river.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.072
"River" is the magic word.

18:43.536 --> 18:44.519
It's working.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.792
Quick, Artoo, quick.
This might be our ticket out of here.

18:48.690 --> 18:49.836
You figured it out?

18:50.095 --> 18:51.314
How could you...

19:19.825 --> 19:21.242
Artoo, we've made it!

19:21.410 --> 19:22.583
<i>We're saved!</i>

19:29.252 --> 19:31.578
The vapors!
Look, artoo, do you see?

19:34.041 --> 19:36.305
That is why the Aleena
cannot seal the breach.

19:36.430 --> 19:38.736
The air below the ground
is deadly to them,

19:38.861 --> 19:40.434
but it has no effect on us.

19:40.559 --> 19:43.304
I understand, artoo.
I finally understand.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.425
They are waiting
for us to help them.

19:46.115 --> 19:47.186
They need us.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.478
We must do what we should
have done in the first place.

19:55.603 --> 19:59.376
We must block the hole which leads
to the underworld using that seal.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.325
That is the breach
that orphne spoke of.

20:06.268 --> 20:08.062
{pos(190,220)}Go, artoo!
You can do it!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.938
{pos(190,220)}What do you mean, I have to help?

20:11.662 --> 20:13.515
{pos(190,220)}No, you are right, artoo.

20:24.702 --> 20:25.837
You are welcome.

20:26.064 --> 20:27.859
I knew we would be able to help.

20:27.984 --> 20:28.893
Hey shiny,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.604
you two finished with those repairs
on the computer system?

20:32.054 --> 20:34.385
My good sir, you may not realize it,

20:34.510 --> 20:36.609
but we have been
on a quite adventure.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.868
Really?
Quite an adventure?

20:39.160 --> 20:40.738
Get a load of this one.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.357
What?
Which one?

20:42.482 --> 20:43.481
What do you...

20:43.826 --> 20:46.389
Just come on.
The commander's been looking for you.

21:03.350 --> 21:05.739
You are most welcome, your majesty.

21:06.051 --> 21:08.993
Just doing our job in
the service of the republic.

21:27.658 --> 21:29.948
No, artoo.
I will tell the story.

21:30.073 --> 21:31.757
No one understands you anyway.

21:33.130 --> 21:34.449
It's only proper.

21:34.574 --> 21:36.294
I am the one who solved the riddle.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.027
I should be the one
to relay the story.

21:39.470 --> 21:42.811
I will, of course,
report on your individual heroics.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.884
Do you think senator Amidala
will hold a state banquet....

21:46.009 --> 21:47.971
As soon as we rendezvous
with master Gallia,

21:48.273 --> 21:49.863
we're off-loading those two.

21:49.988 --> 21:51.793
I couldn't agree more, sir.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.021
Dare to dream, artoo.
Dare to dream.

22:01.270 --> 22:04.072
{fad(500,1000)}Sous-titres:
[swclonewars.1allo.com]

22:05.054 --> 22:06.773
I am C3PO.

22:06.898 --> 22:09.411
Artoo and I have finally
headed home to safety.

22:09.927 --> 22:11.668
And our ship came under

22:11.793 --> 22:13.936
terrifying attack
and we were forced to...

22:14.844 --> 22:18.217
I suppose it might be
simple just to show you.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.725
Is anyone seen the translator droid?

22:21.175 --> 22:22.715
You're under arrest.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.072
I have a bad feeling about this!

22:25.197 --> 22:26.975
See if he can get out of this one.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.507
Star Wars The Clone Wars,

22:28.632 --> 22:30.799
New episodes next friday at 8p/7c.

22:30.924 --> 22:34.560

only on cartoon network!
