00:01.504 --> 00:04.234
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

00:05.374 --> 00:07.968
<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

00:08.811 --> 00:11.211
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

00:12.748 --> 00:15.342
<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

00:20.022 --> 00:22.684
<i>You can see it in her style</i>

00:23.659 --> 00:26.389
<i>You can see it in her smile</i>

00:27.129 --> 00:30.098
<i>You can see it in her flair</i>

00:31.066 --> 00:33.830
<i>And the way she wears her hair</i>

00:36.906 --> 00:38.601
<i>Spinning</i>

00:38.674 --> 00:40.665
<i>Twirling</i>

00:40.743 --> 00:42.074
<i>Girly</i>

00:42.144 --> 00:44.874
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

00:46.048 --> 00:48.516
<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

00:49.285 --> 00:51.753
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

00:53.389 --> 00:56.381
<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

01:00.796 --> 01:04.425
<i>Her shoulders are back
Na, na, na</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:08.129
<i>You'll never see her slack
No, no, no</i>

01:08.204 --> 01:11.731
<i>And even if she falls
Na, na, na</i>

01:11.840 --> 01:15.298
<i>She'll laugh and stand up tall
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:15.377 --> 01:19.177
<i>You can tell she's a princess
Yeah, yeah</i>

01:19.248 --> 01:22.740
<i>She doesn't need a crown
No, no</i>

01:22.818 --> 01:26.584
<i>You can tell she's a princess
Yeah, yeah</i>

01:26.655 --> 01:30.250
<i>She'll turn the world around
Yeah, yeah</i>

01:36.599 --> 01:40.399
<i>But the secret to her majesty</i>

01:40.569 --> 01:43.094
<i>That sets the girl apart</i>

01:43.872 --> 01:47.740
<i>Is the kindness
that shows royalty</i>

01:47.810 --> 01:51.473
<i>It's etched upon her heart</i>

01:58.687 --> 01:59.915
<i>And welcome back!</i>

01:59.989 --> 02:01.957
<i>Andrea and I are
thrilled to be here</i>

02:02.024 --> 02:06.290
<i>bringing you the 144th
Princess Procession!</i>

02:06.362 --> 02:10.092
<i>That's right, Phil! And where
are those princesses processing?</i>

02:10.164 --> 02:11.564
<i>Glad you
asked, Andrea.</i>

02:11.634 --> 02:14.159
<i>Why, to Princess
Charm School, of course,</i>

02:14.236 --> 02:18.366
<i>"Where Glorious Girls
Meet Dreams Of Destiny!"</i>

02:18.641 --> 02:20.074
<i>Emily!</i>

02:20.876 --> 02:24.175
<i>I hope you're doing your homework
and not just watching that parade!</i>

02:24.280 --> 02:25.269
I am, Mom!

02:25.347 --> 02:29.249
<i>Yes, every girl dreams it,
but only a few can achieve it.</i>

02:29.318 --> 02:33.084
<i>For those born to royalty
from kingdoms far and wide,</i>

02:33.389 --> 02:37.189
<i>a chance to earn their
titles as princesses.</i>

02:38.360 --> 02:40.021
<i>And for
those born commoners,</i>

02:40.129 --> 02:43.621
<i>the opportunity to win a place as
a princess' most trusted advisor,</i>

02:44.199 --> 02:45.632
<i>a lady royal!</i>

02:45.901 --> 02:47.095
Boo!

02:51.006 --> 02:52.268
<i>Blair! You're here!</i>

02:52.708 --> 02:55.074
<i>Dance with me,
Princess Emily.</i>

02:57.313 --> 03:00.544
<i>Oh, Phil, it's a beautiful
day here in Gardania,</i>

03:00.616 --> 03:03.449
<i>I've never seen so many
people for the parade!</i>

03:04.119 --> 03:07.555
<i>I know, Andrea. You couldn't be
more right. It's a lovely day,</i>

03:07.623 --> 03:09.853
<i>everybody's having
a wonderful time...</i>

03:14.396 --> 03:16.523
<i>You'll hurt your
eyes looking at this.</i>

03:16.799 --> 03:19.359
Let me get your tiara,
Princess Blair.

03:20.202 --> 03:22.932
I am so
not a princess.

03:23.272 --> 03:26.207
<i>...costumes are magnificent.
They are indeed, Phil.</i>

03:26.275 --> 03:27.833
<i>Every girl's a princess.</i>

03:27.910 --> 03:30.276
Some of them just
have fancier crowns.

03:30.346 --> 03:33.110
<i>Fuchsia.
It's just adorable.</i>

03:33.182 --> 03:34.649
<i>Mom okay?</i>

03:34.950 --> 03:37.748
<i>Kind of. The doctor says
she's comfortable.</i>

03:38.120 --> 03:39.314
Comfortable.

03:39.855 --> 03:41.254
She should be all better.

03:41.690 --> 03:43.385
<i>She'll get
there, though.</i>

03:43.459 --> 03:45.017
I just have to
keep working.

03:45.094 --> 03:48.495
Then we can afford our own
little house in a better area.

03:48.697 --> 03:50.392
<i>With better
doctors for Mom?</i>

03:50.532 --> 03:53.057
Mmm-hmm, and a better
place for you to grow up.

03:54.002 --> 03:56.334
Some place right out of
the pictures you draw.

03:57.906 --> 03:59.134
Blair?

03:59.208 --> 04:01.938
Hi, Mom! I brought
you a blueberry scone.

04:02.311 --> 04:04.302
Oh, thank you.

04:04.747 --> 04:06.180
<i>It's the least I can do.</i>

04:07.316 --> 04:09.307
<i>It's time!
It's time! It's time!</i>

04:09.385 --> 04:11.580
<i>It's Princess Charm
School lottery time!</i>

04:11.653 --> 04:13.177
<i>We have to watch!</i>

<i>And now we'll hear from
Headmistress Alexandra Privet.</i>

04:30.506 --> 04:32.497
<i>At Princess Charm School,</i>

04:32.574 --> 04:36.340
<i>those born to the royal life
unlock their princess potential.</i>

04:36.979 --> 04:40.471
<i>Yet every year, one
regular citizen of Gardania</i>

04:40.549 --> 04:43.245
<i>wins a full scholarship
to the school,</i>

04:43.318 --> 04:45.912
<i>with a chance to
become a lady royal</i>

04:45.988 --> 04:48.115
<i>and change
her life forever.</i>

04:48.924 --> 04:50.050
<i>Will it be you?</i>

04:50.993 --> 04:53.359
Oh, I hope,
I hope, I hope.

04:53.429 --> 04:54.691
Did I mention I hope?

04:54.797 --> 04:58.130
<i>When you're old enough
you'll enter. I promise.</i>

04:58.967 --> 05:00.958
<i>To choose this year's
lottery winner,</i>

05:01.036 --> 05:03.869
<i>I present Miss
Delancy Devin.</i>

05:09.678 --> 05:13.114
<i>You of course mean
Princess Delancy Devin.</i>

05:13.315 --> 05:16.409
<i>My daughter will soon
be ruler of Gardania.</i>

05:17.653 --> 05:21.646
Provided she successfully
completes the semester.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.257
Miss Delancy?

05:46.682 --> 05:48.274
<i>Blair Willows.</i>

05:48.383 --> 05:50.442
<i>And there
you have it!</i>

05:50.519 --> 05:52.817
<i>Blair Willows! This year's
winner... Yes! I knew it!</i>

05:52.888 --> 05:55.083
<i>Woo-hoo!
What? But...</i>

05:55.190 --> 05:57.988
<i>Who's a lady royal?
Blair's a lady royal!</i>

05:58.060 --> 06:00.119
<i>Emily, that's not possible.
Who works in the palace?</i>

06:00.195 --> 06:01.662
Blair works in the palace!

06:01.730 --> 06:03.357
Uh-huh, go Blair!
I never even...

06:03.432 --> 06:04.831
Uh-huh, go Blair!

06:05.234 --> 06:07.566
You
entered for me?

06:07.636 --> 06:09.900
Only five or six times.

06:09.972 --> 06:12.566
A day. For an entire year.

06:13.308 --> 06:14.866
<i>Who's gonna be a lady royal?</i>

06:14.943 --> 06:16.843
<i>Blair's gonna be a lady royal! Emily!</i>

06:16.912 --> 06:19.073
<i>They're here?</i>

06:19.147 --> 06:20.614
<i>They're really here!</i>

06:20.983 --> 06:22.041
Mom?

06:28.957 --> 06:30.390
<i>Blair Willows?</i>

06:35.931 --> 06:38.957
<i>Congratulations. I'm here to
take you to Princess Charm School.</i>

06:39.868 --> 06:41.563
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

06:41.637 --> 06:43.002
<i>There's been a mistake.</i>

06:43.071 --> 06:45.369
<i>I'm not going to
Princess Charm School.</i>

06:45.507 --> 06:46.838
<i>Yes, you are!</i>

06:47.142 --> 06:51.203
<i>Emily, I don't belong with a bunch
of princesses and lady royals.</i>

06:51.880 --> 06:53.814
<i>Look at me!
I'm a waitress!</i>

06:53.982 --> 06:57.213
<i>I've got straws in my pocket
and ketchup on my socks.</i>

06:57.553 --> 06:59.111
You look perfect.

06:59.187 --> 07:02.520
<i>Thank you. But the girls
there won't think so.</i>

07:02.591 --> 07:04.957
And I have
responsibilities here.

07:05.961 --> 07:09.328
<i>Blair, it wasn't right of
Emily to go behind your back,</i>

07:09.398 --> 07:11.559
but this is a
big opportunity.

07:12.034 --> 07:14.093
A position as
a lady royal?

07:15.537 --> 07:19.029
<i>Would change
our lives forever.</i>

07:24.379 --> 07:25.368
<i>I'll go.</i>

07:25.781 --> 07:27.009
Yes!

07:34.122 --> 07:37.023
<i>Wow, you get to
ride in a carriage!</i>

07:39.761 --> 07:41.422
<i>It's time to go.
Now?</i>

07:41.563 --> 07:42.587
Now.

07:42.664 --> 07:45.462
<i>Uh... Just let me pull
together some clothes and I...</i>

07:45.534 --> 07:47.297
<i>It's all at
the school.</i>

07:47.369 --> 07:49.963
<i>We need to leave now, or
you forfeit your scholarship.</i>

07:50.038 --> 07:51.369
But what about my...

07:51.440 --> 07:53.499
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock.

07:56.011 --> 07:57.239
I love you.

08:00.816 --> 08:02.613
<i>I won't let you down.</i>

08:03.552 --> 08:04.644
<i>Blair!</i>

08:20.569 --> 08:21.831
<i>Blair!</i>

08:22.838 --> 08:24.738
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

08:24.806 --> 08:26.637
<i>Bye, Mom!
Bye, Emily!</i>

08:35.017 --> 08:36.347
Goodbye, Blair!

08:38.153 --> 08:39.881
<i>You'll always be my princess.</i>

09:12.254 --> 09:14.654
Ah! Great!

09:16.058 --> 09:18.424
<i>I've already flunked
carriage riding.</i>

09:27.969 --> 09:29.266
<i>Whoa.</i>

09:47.823 --> 09:49.120
Thanks for the ride.

09:49.791 --> 09:52.521
Uh, hey, I wonder if
you could maybe show me...

09:53.061 --> 09:54.085
Oh.

09:54.596 --> 09:55.620
Or not.

10:23.158 --> 10:25.023
Ooh!
Hey!

10:25.093 --> 10:26.390
Pardon me.

10:42.978 --> 10:44.707
You scared me!

10:46.681 --> 10:49.912
<i>Aww, it's okay.
You're a good dog.</i>

10:52.120 --> 10:53.553
<i>"Prince. "</i>

10:53.655 --> 10:55.782
Good boy, Prince.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.454
<i>Hmm. You must
be Blair Willows.</i>

11:00.228 --> 11:03.994
<i>We don't usually find our future
lady royals sprawled on the floor.</i>

11:04.065 --> 11:06.295
Oh! Um, hi.

11:06.902 --> 11:08.369
Sorry about the floor.

11:08.436 --> 11:10.631
<i>He's just...
He's very sweet.</i>

11:11.373 --> 11:13.398
<i>Not usually.
He's normally quite shy.</i>

11:15.310 --> 11:16.743
Go lie down, Prince.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.713
I am Headmistress Privet.

11:19.781 --> 11:21.373
<i>Welcome to
Charm School.</i>

11:21.449 --> 11:23.610
<i>Thank you.
It's really an honor.</i>

11:23.685 --> 11:25.448
Shall I take you
to your locker?

11:27.455 --> 11:30.117
Princess Charm School was
founded on the principles

11:30.192 --> 11:33.992
of instilling young women
with character and confidence.

11:34.162 --> 11:38.496
And it has been preparing them for
royal life for nearly five centuries.

11:39.768 --> 11:41.099
<i>Wow.</i>

11:41.169 --> 11:42.636
<i>Emily would love this.</i>

11:43.438 --> 11:45.235
<i>She's always wanted
to come here.</i>

11:46.074 --> 11:47.063
<i>Emily?</i>

11:47.309 --> 11:50.540
<i>My little sister. She's the one
who entered me in the lottery.</i>

11:50.612 --> 11:51.909
I never would
have come,

11:51.980 --> 11:55.814
<i>but it's a chance to make a
better life for her and for my mom.</i>

11:56.284 --> 11:57.273
Ah.

11:58.386 --> 12:02.686
Blair, only 27% of the lottery
girls make it through to graduation.

12:02.958 --> 12:04.619
Do you think
you can handle it?

12:05.026 --> 12:07.426
<i>I think so. I'll sure try.</i>

12:09.231 --> 12:11.495
<i>You'll notice that
all of our students</i>

12:11.566 --> 12:15.627
carry themselves with dignity
and sophistication.

12:15.704 --> 12:19.105
<i>Weekly
dress-up tea socials!</i>

12:19.174 --> 12:22.871
Yes! And we can give each other
fun nicknames and swap shoes!

12:22.944 --> 12:25.674
<i>Shh, ladies.</i>

12:27.983 --> 12:31.384
<i>Dress up tea socials in
our dorm room every week!</i>

12:33.188 --> 12:35.986
This is the original
Princess Charm School.

12:36.057 --> 12:38.150
The centuries-old castle.

12:38.226 --> 12:42.458
Most classes and the student
dorms are in our new section.

12:42.530 --> 12:44.191
Our world-class
amenities

12:44.266 --> 12:47.235
include a state-of-the-art
digital classroom.

12:49.838 --> 12:52.534
To your left, our
Olympic-sized ballroom.

12:53.475 --> 12:57.275
And my personal favorite,
our luxurious spa.

12:57.345 --> 13:00.178
I do enjoy a good
mani-pedi from time to time.

13:00.248 --> 13:02.307
<i>Blair Willows!
Ah. Here we are.</i>

13:02.384 --> 13:03.612
<i>Blair Willows!</i>

13:03.685 --> 13:05.710
<i>Anyone seen a
"Blair Willows"?</i>

13:07.923 --> 13:11.552
<i>At your service, miss?</i>

13:11.993 --> 13:13.392
This is Grace.

13:13.495 --> 13:16.225
Your personal
princess assistant.

13:16.398 --> 13:19.060
<i>Every student at Princess
Charm School has one.</i>

13:19.334 --> 13:22.929
They are usually punctual,
and usually helpful.

13:24.105 --> 13:27.336
I shall leave you in her...
Capable hands.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.535
I am so sorry.

13:32.013 --> 13:33.981
It was buttercream.

13:34.215 --> 13:37.446
<i>Now if someone spills a pot roast
on me, I'll be a complete meal.</i>

13:38.553 --> 13:41.488
I just wanted to give you the
traditional welcome cupcake.

13:42.324 --> 13:44.554
You wanna change
clothes? Follow me.

13:50.966 --> 13:53.560
It has everything a
princess student needs.

13:53.635 --> 13:57.127
Books, pens, paper,
make-up mirrors,

13:57.672 --> 13:59.469
sparkle purse
collection.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.475
And of course
emergency pumps.

14:02.477 --> 14:04.502
This is my locker?

14:04.713 --> 14:06.874
<i>Then we've got
your beauty supplies.</i>

14:07.182 --> 14:09.810
Jewel-encrusted hairbrush,
diamond lipstick.

14:10.051 --> 14:12.110
Oh, I love this perfume! Ooh!

14:12.187 --> 14:14.951
Ugh!

14:15.657 --> 14:16.646
Ugh!

14:17.525 --> 14:19.925
<i>I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.</i>

14:20.628 --> 14:24.496
Um, Delancy?

14:25.433 --> 14:28.732
<i>There's such a thing
as too much perfume.</i>

14:29.104 --> 14:30.093
Portia!

14:30.405 --> 14:31.929
<i>Oh, no, you're...</i>

14:32.007 --> 14:34.771
<i>Furious, that's
what I am!</i>

14:34.843 --> 14:36.367
How dare you?

14:36.444 --> 14:38.844
<i>Look, Delancy. They're
serving floor cakes.</i>

14:40.048 --> 14:41.174
I just got here.

14:41.516 --> 14:43.006
You just got here?

14:43.218 --> 14:45.152
Let me guess.

14:45.220 --> 14:47.620
<i>Blair Willows,
the lottery girl?</i>

14:47.689 --> 14:49.623
Yes! So you understand.

14:49.691 --> 14:51.591
Oh, this is all so new to me, and I...

14:51.659 --> 14:54.253
I understand the
lottery is a joke.

14:54.329 --> 14:55.455
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

14:57.565 --> 15:00.329
<i>Commoners like you
don't belong here.</i>

15:00.402 --> 15:01.460
<i>Right, Portia?</i>

15:01.803 --> 15:02.929
<i>What?</i>

15:03.338 --> 15:04.737
<i>Wickellia!</i>

15:04.806 --> 15:08.503
<i>Yes, Your Wonderful...
Ness.</i>

15:08.576 --> 15:11.306
I need a princess
pamper package, pronto!

15:11.379 --> 15:14.439
Make way!
To the spa!

15:15.216 --> 15:17.116
Uh, are you
taking orders?

15:17.185 --> 15:20.484
Because I would do anything
for a double foam mocha latte.

15:20.722 --> 15:22.349
The floorcake
was delicious.

15:22.424 --> 15:23.550
<i>Portia!</i>

15:27.629 --> 15:30.723
As you can see,
everyone here is so nice.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.528
Most of the time.

15:32.834 --> 15:36.031
<i>Uh, so let's get
you ready for school.</i>

15:36.438 --> 15:40.465
Locker, please extend
curtain for a princess primp.

15:45.447 --> 15:47.381
<i>Oh, it's fabulous!</i>

15:47.482 --> 15:49.882
The best thing about
Princess Charm School!

15:49.951 --> 15:52.476
Go on. Get gorgeous!

16:11.272 --> 16:14.002
Oh, pretty as a princess.

16:14.609 --> 16:16.201
Lady royal.

16:17.278 --> 16:20.975
<i>Okay, now your schedule
and let's get you settled.</i>

16:21.049 --> 16:22.243
<i>I'd love to.</i>

16:35.930 --> 16:37.158
<i>Wow.</i>

16:37.599 --> 16:39.692
Hey! Our new roomie, right?

16:40.301 --> 16:41.825
Princess or lady royal?

16:42.303 --> 16:43.998
Lady royal. You?

16:44.439 --> 16:46.100
Princess.
Isla, too.

16:47.108 --> 16:48.234
Do you play?

16:59.787 --> 17:00.845
<i>Nice.</i>

17:01.456 --> 17:02.582
Oh!

17:03.258 --> 17:04.919
<i>Oh! I'm so sorry!</i>

17:05.193 --> 17:06.523
Are you kidding?

17:06.594 --> 17:08.721
<i>Isla's been Miss
Mum's-The-Word about the tunes</i>

17:08.796 --> 17:10.787
<i>and I've been
dying to hear them!</i>

17:11.398 --> 17:12.957
<i>I'm still working
on them.</i>

17:13.300 --> 17:15.165
<i>They're not ready
for anyone to hear.</i>

17:15.369 --> 17:18.031
<i>Really? What I heard rocked.</i>

17:18.106 --> 17:20.733
Yeah! See? Play one
of your tunes for us!

17:24.679 --> 17:26.510
<i>That's okay. No rush.</i>

17:27.549 --> 17:29.380
<i>I'm Hadley.
Blair.</i>

17:29.984 --> 17:32.282
<i>Blair Willows?
The lottery winner?</i>

17:32.820 --> 17:34.151
Is it that obvious?

17:34.589 --> 17:37.023
<i>Yup, 'cause they
announced it on TV</i>

17:37.091 --> 17:39.116
<i>that "Blair Willows"
was the lottery winner.</i>

17:39.794 --> 17:42.092
Oh, right. Sorry.

17:42.564 --> 17:44.395
<i>Guess I'm just a
little overwhelmed.</i>

17:44.866 --> 17:47.357
<i>All princesses and
lady-royals-in-training</i>

17:47.435 --> 17:49.733
<i>are due at the Starlight
Welcome in one minute.</i>

17:49.804 --> 17:51.999
One minute?

17:54.108 --> 17:55.405
<i>Whoa!</i>

18:30.745 --> 18:32.144
<i>Welcome, students.</i>

18:32.647 --> 18:34.046
<i>Oh!</i>

18:34.816 --> 18:36.249
<i>And dogs.</i>

18:36.317 --> 18:39.184
<i>Tonight you begin the greatest
challenge of your life,</i>

18:39.254 --> 18:41.722
<i>training to be a
princess or lady royal,</i>

18:42.490 --> 18:45.015
<i>the most important
jobs of the realm.</i>

18:45.593 --> 18:49.461
<i>Your classmates, Lorraine and Josette,
are bringing around your training tiaras.</i>

18:51.666 --> 18:52.690
Thank you.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.894
<i>Don't get
too used to them.</i>

18:54.969 --> 18:58.837
<i>Only those who succeed this
semester will earn the real versions.</i>

18:59.874 --> 19:03.366
<i>Fail as a princess-in-training
and you will not be crowned.</i>

19:04.479 --> 19:06.606
<i>We have very high
expectations here.</i>

19:07.148 --> 19:10.584
<i>Each of you must attend every
class on time and in uniform,</i>

19:10.652 --> 19:13.086
<i>and your grades must
be exceptional.</i>

19:13.488 --> 19:18.323
<i>That said, I believe every one
of you has princess potential.</i>

19:19.494 --> 19:21.928
<i>Work hard and
stay dedicated,</i>

19:21.996 --> 19:23.987
<i>and you will achieve it.</i>

19:27.335 --> 19:28.893
<i>I'm so sorry,
Dame Devin,</i>

19:28.970 --> 19:30.460
<i>that's a nasty little
tickle there,</i>

19:30.538 --> 19:32.062
would you like a
glass of water?

19:32.540 --> 19:34.735
<i>I'd like a
proper introduction.</i>

19:35.043 --> 19:36.476
<i>Certainly.</i>

19:37.011 --> 19:38.069
Students.

19:38.846 --> 19:40.245
Dame Devin.

19:45.987 --> 19:48.251
<i>I have an earth-shattering
announcement.</i>

19:50.825 --> 19:53.953
<i>This is my last semester
of teaching before I...</i>

19:54.362 --> 19:58.321
<i>Um, before my daughter
takes over Gardania.</i>

19:59.534 --> 20:01.559
<i>No, no, hold
back your tears.</i>

20:02.236 --> 20:04.727
<i>Ms. Privet will take over
my classes next year.</i>

20:04.806 --> 20:06.239
<i>In her own little way.</i>

20:06.307 --> 20:09.333
<i>Of course, no one knows
the royal life as I do.</i>

20:09.410 --> 20:10.877
<i>I've lived at the
palace ever since</i>

20:10.945 --> 20:14.574
<i>my dear sister-in-law Queen
Isabella and her family died,</i>

20:15.083 --> 20:17.278
<i>and it has been my
great... If they died...</i>

20:17.819 --> 20:19.446
You know the legend?

20:20.188 --> 20:21.314
<i>What legend?</i>

20:21.389 --> 20:24.017
<i>There's a legend that
Queen Isabella and her family</i>

20:24.092 --> 20:26.083
<i>didn't all die
in the accident.</i>

20:26.728 --> 20:28.320
I love that you
know that story.

20:28.396 --> 20:32.355
<i>...and so I welcome you all
to Princess Charm School.</i>

20:32.433 --> 20:35.061
<i>May your time
here be magical.</i>

20:41.309 --> 20:42.503
<i>Two lines, everyone!</i>

20:42.977 --> 20:45.775
<i>Curtseys to all and then
everyone's excused for bed.</i>

20:50.485 --> 20:53.477
<i>Favorite legend about
the Gardania Royal Family, go.</i>

20:54.989 --> 20:57.116
<i>I don't know any
of the legends.</i>

20:57.658 --> 20:59.717
So missing out.

20:59.794 --> 21:01.352
Isla, go.

21:01.763 --> 21:03.355
<i>My fave's a simple one.</i>

21:03.431 --> 21:05.456
<i>Gardania's magical crown.</i>

21:05.533 --> 21:07.626
<i>Gardania's magical
crown?</i>

21:08.169 --> 21:09.636
<i>Ow!</i>

21:09.904 --> 21:10.893
<i>Oh, no.</i>

21:11.272 --> 21:13.240
Ugh! You again?

21:13.841 --> 21:14.967
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

21:15.042 --> 21:18.603
<i>What is with you?
You're a walking disaster!</i>

21:24.652 --> 21:28.281
<i>I don't think Delancy and I
are going to hang out much.</i>

21:28.956 --> 21:31.288
<i>That's okay, you'll be
hanging out with us.</i>

21:31.793 --> 21:34.421
Better believe it. And wait
till classes start tomorrow.

21:34.495 --> 21:36.827
I bet you can do
anything she can do.

21:37.532 --> 21:40.797
Sure, I can do
anything she can do.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.700
I cannot do
anything she can do.

21:53.281 --> 21:55.977
Poise. Proper poise
commands respect,

21:56.050 --> 21:58.416
a necessity for anyone
in the royal life.

22:00.054 --> 22:01.487
Thank you, Delancy.

22:08.129 --> 22:10.256
Now, princesses,
lady royals,

22:10.331 --> 22:12.629
<i>let's see what
you can do, hmm.</i>

22:12.700 --> 22:16.192
Start with one book
and glide, glide.

22:16.270 --> 22:18.534
Smoothly, gracefully.

22:19.740 --> 22:22.732
I can balance a tray of coffee
cups for customers, right?

22:23.878 --> 22:26.210
<i>Of course, I've never
done it on my head.</i>

22:31.486 --> 22:34.387
<i>Hadley, you're tenderizing
your brains. Stop.</i>

22:36.123 --> 22:38.648
<i>That's lovely, Isla.</i>

22:38.726 --> 22:40.216
Thank you,
Dame Devin.

22:40.294 --> 22:44.230
If you want to be the crazy
princess who hears music in her head.

22:44.499 --> 22:46.057
<i>Whoa!</i>

22:46.701 --> 22:50.137
<i>Lorraine, you're practicing
poise, not lifting weights.</i>

22:51.272 --> 22:54.969
Like a princess, Josette,
not a migrating duck.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.202
Portia.

22:56.744 --> 22:58.234
<i>What?</i>

22:58.880 --> 23:00.973
<i>You're
doing fine.</i>

23:08.155 --> 23:11.022
Come on. Come on!

23:11.526 --> 23:13.016
<i>Do it for Emily.</i>

23:13.761 --> 23:16.423
Did you get those
shoes at a garage sale?

23:25.139 --> 23:26.504
Is it nap time?

23:26.574 --> 23:28.132
How come
nobody told me?

23:28.543 --> 23:32.138
<i>You. What do you have
to say for this disaster?</i>

23:32.547 --> 23:35.675
It was an
accident, Dame Devin.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.183
I was trying...
Stand up.

23:38.753 --> 23:40.618
<i>You're the lottery
girl, aren't you?</i>

23:41.122 --> 23:42.350
Yes, Dame Devin.

23:42.857 --> 23:45.348
I should have known.
Meet my eyes, girl.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.394
A true lady royal
never hangs her head.

24:02.310 --> 24:05.905
Mother? You were going
to say something to Blair?

24:08.115 --> 24:09.207
Yes!

24:09.283 --> 24:12.252
You are utterly unfit
for the royal life!

24:12.320 --> 24:14.345
<i>I want you out
of this class!</i>

24:14.422 --> 24:16.913
You might also think about whether
someone from your station in life

24:16.991 --> 24:21.553
<i>should even stay someplace where
you so clearly don't belong!</i>

24:22.663 --> 24:23.925
I understand.

24:43.951 --> 24:46.078
<i>They're serving
strawberry swirl today!</i>

24:48.990 --> 24:50.218
Thank you, Miranda.

24:54.428 --> 24:55.986
<i>Don't let Dame Devin bug you.</i>

24:56.063 --> 24:58.964
<i>Legend has it she's
actually a reptile alien</i>

24:59.033 --> 25:00.591
from the other side
of the universe.

25:06.340 --> 25:08.638
You know what really
bugs me, Portia?

25:08.843 --> 25:10.572
Yodeling hand puppets?

25:10.878 --> 25:14.109
<i>When a commoner like Blair
comes to Princess Charm School,</i>

25:14.181 --> 25:16.672
she makes it less special.

25:16.751 --> 25:18.981
She makes us
less special.

25:19.053 --> 25:20.042
She does?

25:20.154 --> 25:21.917
She totally does.

25:21.989 --> 25:23.957
Specialness is like
this piece of cake.

25:24.659 --> 25:26.854
<i>There's only so
much to go around.</i>

25:26.927 --> 25:29.395
If Blair takes a
huge chunk of it,

25:30.865 --> 25:32.025
<i>what's left for us?</i>

25:32.800 --> 25:34.233
You stole my cake!

25:34.402 --> 25:35.391
Not me.

25:36.737 --> 25:37.726
Blair!

25:38.773 --> 25:41.901
How dare she!
I wanted that cake.

25:42.076 --> 25:43.976
<i>Don't worry. I have
a feeling she won't</i>

25:44.045 --> 25:46.445
be around to steal
cake much longer.

25:46.947 --> 25:48.278
<i>Wickellia!</i>

25:49.383 --> 25:51.078
<i>Yes, your
Royal Sneakiness?</i>

25:59.026 --> 26:02.928
<i>So we're coming around showing
everyone our school spirit cheer.</i>

26:03.531 --> 26:04.930
<i>'Cause when
you've got spirit,</i>

26:04.999 --> 26:06.591
<i>it's what we
want to hear!</i>

26:06.834 --> 26:08.802
Thanks, Lorraine. Josette.

26:09.003 --> 26:11.369
<i>Yeah. That was cute.
Rhyming and all.</i>

26:11.605 --> 26:12.867
<i>We'll see ya.</i>

26:12.940 --> 26:15.841
<i>Oh, that wasn't the cheer.
Had to make that clear.</i>

26:15.910 --> 26:17.377
<i>But don't you
ever fear.</i>

26:17.445 --> 26:19.970
<i>'Cause the time
to cheer is here!</i>

26:20.047 --> 26:21.344
One, two, three!

26:21.415 --> 26:23.474
Princess Charm
School is the best!

26:23.551 --> 26:25.485
<i>Royal skills put
to the test!</i>

26:25.553 --> 26:27.487
<i>We can dance and
we've got poise!</i>

26:27.555 --> 26:29.580
<i>Now it's time to
make some noise!</i>

26:29.657 --> 26:32.854
<i>Go, Princess Charm School!</i>

26:35.196 --> 26:38.290
<i>Wow. Cool cheer.
Thanks for sharing.</i>

26:38.899 --> 26:40.298
Part of caring!

26:42.169 --> 26:43.693
You guys ready?

26:57.885 --> 26:59.614
<i>I'm so sorry... I...</i>

27:03.591 --> 27:05.058
I have to go.

27:11.198 --> 27:13.359
Serves her right
for stealing my cake.

27:20.441 --> 27:22.568
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

27:22.643 --> 27:24.076
<i>I don't fit in
here at all.</i>

27:24.945 --> 27:26.708
<i>I'm like a burp
in a symphony.</i>

27:27.414 --> 27:29.439
You have to give
yourself more time.

27:30.251 --> 27:32.276
<i>You're right.
With more time,</i>

27:32.353 --> 27:34.446
maybe I could destroy
the whole school.

27:35.422 --> 27:37.185
<i>No, Dame Devin's right,</i>

27:37.691 --> 27:39.784
<i>I'm not Princess
Charm School material.</i>

27:40.494 --> 27:42.223
Seriously? Blair.

27:42.296 --> 27:44.992
Dame Devin was Princess
Charm School material.

27:46.167 --> 27:47.395
<i>What do you mean?</i>

27:47.468 --> 27:49.459
Oh, I know this story!

27:49.537 --> 27:53.303
She was a lottery winner, but no
princess picked her to be a lady royal,

27:53.474 --> 27:56.568
not even her sister-in-law,
Queen Isabella.

27:56.677 --> 27:59.373
<i>Exactly. If Delancy weren't
in line for the throne,</i>

27:59.446 --> 28:02.040
Dame Devin would be no more
special than anyone else.

28:02.716 --> 28:03.808
<i>Wow.</i>

28:04.819 --> 28:07.549
<i>But
it's not just her.</i>

28:07.621 --> 28:09.987
<i>Everyone thinks I
don't belong here.</i>

28:12.092 --> 28:13.582
<i>Everyone except you guys.</i>

28:18.065 --> 28:20.033
<i>A little help,
please?</i>

28:23.637 --> 28:25.195
Ooh, care package!

28:27.608 --> 28:30.441
<i>It's for you from...
Emily Willows?</i>

28:35.549 --> 28:37.210
<i>Emily? Really?</i>

28:43.390 --> 28:44.789
<i>That's pretty.</i>

28:44.859 --> 28:45.883
<i>Emily drew it.</i>

28:46.760 --> 28:50.093
<i>She loved the story of me being
found on my mom's doorstep.</i>

28:50.631 --> 28:52.258
I was only one.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.400
<i>Mom adopted Emily
a few years later.</i>

28:57.671 --> 28:59.468
<i>They're everything
to me.</i>

29:03.677 --> 29:05.975
<i>One-two-three,
one-two-three,</i>

29:06.113 --> 29:08.479
one-two-three,
one-two-three,

29:08.549 --> 29:10.813
one-two-three,
one-two-three,

29:10.885 --> 29:13.410
and one-two-three,
one-two-three,

29:13.487 --> 29:16.081
one-two-three,
one-two-three... Ow.

29:17.658 --> 29:19.216
<i>Again, Blair?</i>

29:19.960 --> 29:21.325
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

29:21.395 --> 29:23.590
<i>You've stepped on
eight of my toes!</i>

29:23.731 --> 29:25.323
I only have four left!

29:25.733 --> 29:28.065
Two. You have two left.

29:30.004 --> 29:31.596
<i>That's even worse!</i>

29:34.909 --> 29:37.469
Thank you, everyone.
See you tomorrow.

29:37.811 --> 29:39.711
Not you, Blair.

29:40.247 --> 29:42.579
<i>I'd like to see
you after class.</i>

29:42.650 --> 29:45.016
<i>Well, isn't
that a surprise?</i>

29:50.391 --> 29:52.882
<i>Is...
Is everything okay?</i>

29:53.360 --> 29:55.089
<i>No, it's not, Blair.</i>

29:55.162 --> 29:58.529
Yesterday Dame Devin
recommended we expel you.

29:59.433 --> 30:00.525
Oh.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.233
<i>I can't say I blame her.</i>

30:02.303 --> 30:04.771
<i>I know it's only been a
couple of days, but honestly,</i>

30:04.838 --> 30:06.931
<i>I don't think
I have ever seen</i>

30:07.007 --> 30:09.976
such a disaster of a student
come through these halls.

30:10.778 --> 30:11.972
I see.

30:12.212 --> 30:14.612
Tell you the truth,
I was almost going to do it.

30:16.517 --> 30:18.610
<i>Did you say "almost"?</i>

30:19.119 --> 30:20.177
<i>Almost.</i>

30:21.388 --> 30:23.788
Do you know what it
takes to make a princess?

30:24.458 --> 30:27.018
A crown?
No, not a crown.

30:27.628 --> 30:28.856
Character.

30:29.563 --> 30:33.556
All our classes in
poise, manners, dancing,

30:33.634 --> 30:35.465
<i>they're not superficial.</i>

30:35.536 --> 30:37.401
They build confidence.

30:37.671 --> 30:41.038
But confidence without
character is dangerous.

30:41.575 --> 30:43.770
You, Blair, have
a different problem.

30:44.244 --> 30:46.235
Character without
confidence.

30:47.348 --> 30:49.680
So you are going
to expel me?

30:51.251 --> 30:53.481
<i>I'm going to tutor you.</i>

30:53.854 --> 30:57.756
If you can dig deep and
find the princess inside you,

30:57.825 --> 30:59.725
<i>I have no doubt
you'll graduate</i>

30:59.793 --> 31:02.421
with your pick of any
lady royal position.

31:02.896 --> 31:04.557
If you can
handle it.

31:04.631 --> 31:06.565
Now, what
do you say?

31:07.835 --> 31:08.995
Yes!

31:09.203 --> 31:10.192
Ooh!

31:10.537 --> 31:13.700
Uh, rule number one,
no hugging the tutor.

31:13.874 --> 31:17.173
<i>Sorry. I just...
When do we start?</i>

31:17.511 --> 31:19.240
<i>Right now.</i>

31:21.348 --> 31:24.579
I can do this because I
am perfectly comfortable

31:24.651 --> 31:27.677
and at ease with myself and in my body.

31:28.155 --> 31:30.783
<i>That's because you're not
surrounded by people</i>

31:30.858 --> 31:32.917
who make you feel like
a complete nothing.

31:33.160 --> 31:36.687
No one can make you feel
inferior without your consent.

31:37.598 --> 31:38.997
<i>Right. Your turn.</i>

31:39.266 --> 31:42.724
<i>Headmistress Privet,
there's no way I can do this.</i>

31:43.303 --> 31:45.430
<i>Not if you don't
believe you can.</i>

31:46.006 --> 31:47.200
<i>We start small.</i>

31:51.612 --> 31:54.012
Thirty seconds,
right here on the ground.

31:56.717 --> 31:58.708
<i>That's right.
Just like that.</i>

31:58.986 --> 32:01.750
<i>I can't.
I can't do it.</i>

32:01.822 --> 32:02.982
Yeah, of course
you can...

32:06.460 --> 32:09.952
<i>Right. I see we have our
work cut out for us.</i>

32:25.946 --> 32:28.574
<i>I don't have the balance</i>

32:28.816 --> 32:30.784
<i>Think I'm gonna fall</i>

32:31.585 --> 32:33.576
<i>Wish I had the talent</i>

32:33.954 --> 32:35.854
<i>I don't belong here at all</i>

32:48.602 --> 32:51.070
<i>Drowning in the pressure</i>

32:51.405 --> 32:52.838
<i>In over my head</i>

32:53.707 --> 32:56.437
<i>Why did I think
I could do this</i>

32:56.510 --> 32:58.910
<i>I could have
walked away instead</i>

32:59.213 --> 33:01.909
<i>This is my chance
to break free</i>

33:01.982 --> 33:04.712
<i>Everything's depending on me</i>

33:04.785 --> 33:07.549
<i>And if I keep trying I'll be</i>

33:07.621 --> 33:10.784
<i>On top of the world</i>

33:10.858 --> 33:15.386
<i>Where I can see
everything before me</i>

33:15.462 --> 33:18.863
<i>Reaching up to
touch the sky</i>

33:18.932 --> 33:22.424
<i>On top of the world</i>

33:22.503 --> 33:26.667
<i>All my dreams are
rushing toward me</i>

33:26.740 --> 33:30.141
<i>Stretching out my wings to fly</i>

33:30.210 --> 33:33.179
<i>On top of the world</i>

33:36.183 --> 33:39.084
<i>On top of the world</i>

33:44.958 --> 33:47.188
<i>Nothing's gonna break me</i>

33:47.861 --> 33:49.328
<i>Gonna get it right</i>

33:50.664 --> 33:55.158
<i>Even if it takes me
doing it a thousand times</i>

33:56.236 --> 33:58.170
<i>Trying once is easy</i>

33:59.173 --> 34:01.004
<i>Discipline is hard</i>

34:01.642 --> 34:03.473
<i>But nothing can defeat me</i>

34:04.478 --> 34:06.878
<i>If the change is in my heart</i>

34:06.947 --> 34:09.710
<i>This is my chance to break
free This is my chance</i>

34:09.783 --> 34:12.478
<i>Everything's depending on me
On me</i>

34:12.553 --> 34:15.386
<i>And if I keep trying I'll be
I'll be</i>

34:15.455 --> 34:18.514
<i>On top of the world</i>

34:18.592 --> 34:22.790
<i>Where I can see
everything before me</i>

34:23.030 --> 34:26.591
<i>Stretching out my wings to fly</i>

34:26.667 --> 34:29.726
<i>On top of the world</i>

34:33.306 --> 34:37.300
I need two rows. Ladies on the
pink line, gentlemen on the blue.

34:39.313 --> 34:41.781
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to our joint dance class</i>

34:41.848 --> 34:43.610
with Prince
Charming Academy.

34:45.752 --> 34:48.983
If we could keep the
shrieking to a minimum,

34:49.056 --> 34:50.989
it would be much
appreciated.

34:51.824 --> 34:54.658
<i>Hmm, it looks like
we'll have one extra lady.</i>

34:55.795 --> 34:58.321
<i>Delancy, that's
the pink line.</i>

34:59.600 --> 35:01.227
<i>I just don't see
Prince Nicholas.</i>

35:01.301 --> 35:03.098
<i>He's the one I
want to dance with.</i>

35:03.870 --> 35:05.360
<i>Maybe he's invisible.</i>

35:05.439 --> 35:08.602
No daughter of mine sits
on the sidelines at a dance.

35:08.675 --> 35:10.006
But, Mother...

35:10.677 --> 35:14.238
<i>Looks like you're going to have
to sit out this one, dear. Pity.</i>

35:15.082 --> 35:18.483
<i>All right, everyone's
paired up! Let's begin!</i>

35:20.887 --> 35:22.548
Ugh.

35:26.460 --> 35:29.224
Okay, come along.
Gentlemen, please bow.

35:29.296 --> 35:30.854
Ladies, will you curtsey.

35:36.103 --> 35:38.128
<i>Sorry I'm late...</i>

35:38.272 --> 35:40.536
<i>Oh, no! I'm so sorry.</i>

35:41.141 --> 35:42.608
<i>It's okay.</i>

35:43.010 --> 35:45.945
<i>No, it's not.
I feel awful. Please.</i>

35:49.149 --> 35:50.343
Thank you.

35:54.488 --> 35:55.477
<i>Whoa.</i>

35:55.722 --> 35:57.747
<i>Sorry. I didn't
mean to be late.</i>

35:59.226 --> 36:02.195
<i>That's fine. The two of you can
partner up and join the dance.</i>

36:03.830 --> 36:06.799
<i>Now, gentlemen, lightly kiss
the top of your partner's hand...</i>

36:07.801 --> 36:09.359
And dance.

36:11.938 --> 36:16.136
Milady, I am Nicholas,
young swain from the east,

36:16.209 --> 36:18.507
most privileged to
make your acquaintance.

36:19.279 --> 36:20.769
Think that was
polite enough?

36:20.847 --> 36:22.212
Absolutely.

36:22.416 --> 36:23.849
Think you can top it?

36:24.351 --> 36:28.845
I, kind swain, am Blair,
maiden of Gardania,

36:28.922 --> 36:32.824
honored above all to be
welcomed into your swaininess.

36:33.527 --> 36:35.518
<i>Well done.
I try.</i>

37:41.728 --> 37:43.161
<i>Wonderful, everyone!</i>

37:43.230 --> 37:46.825
<i>Wonderful, now a final bow
and curtsey to your partners,</i>

37:46.900 --> 37:49.562
and we say our farewells
to the young gentlemen

37:49.636 --> 37:51.331
of Prince
Charming Academy.

37:52.973 --> 37:55.567
Keeping in mind that
you will see them again

37:55.642 --> 37:58.805
at the Coronation Day ceremony
at the end of the school year.

37:59.980 --> 38:03.006
I shall count the
moments till then.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.948
As will I, good sir.

38:17.364 --> 38:19.696
<i>I have an
exciting announcement.</i>

38:21.501 --> 38:24.265
Thanks to the generosity
of Dame Devin,

38:24.337 --> 38:28.467
dinner tonight will be a chance for
you to get a taste of your future.

38:29.075 --> 38:31.441
Our manners class
served in the palace.

38:31.511 --> 38:34.969
Yes! Sweet!
No way!

38:35.682 --> 38:38.776
The palace! Can you
even imagine it?

38:39.386 --> 38:42.287
I grew up in the palace,
Portia. I live there.

38:42.556 --> 38:43.545
Oh.

38:45.292 --> 38:46.816
But can you imagine it?

38:48.094 --> 38:50.824
<i>To prepare for this event,
you'll all have the afternoon</i>

38:50.897 --> 38:53.331
to pamper yourselves
in the spa.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.830
Your princess assistants

38:56.136 --> 38:59.264
will help you take advantage
of all the amenities.

38:59.506 --> 39:00.666
<i>Enjoy.</i>

39:07.681 --> 39:08.841
<i>Wickellia.</i>

39:17.324 --> 39:18.348
<i>Whoa!</i>

39:28.502 --> 39:30.993
<i>Top thing you've always
wanted to see in the palace</i>

39:31.071 --> 39:33.164
<i>that you can't
wait to see.</i>

39:33.240 --> 39:34.571
Blair, go.

39:35.509 --> 39:38.171
<i>Hmm, I've never thought
about the palace,</i>

39:38.245 --> 39:39.644
<i>but Emily would
go nuts for it.</i>

39:40.514 --> 39:43.449
I want to remember everything
so I can tell her.

39:44.584 --> 39:46.142
Manicure time!

39:48.321 --> 39:50.255
Nice. Isla, go.

39:51.558 --> 39:53.549
<i>I'd love to find out more
about what happened</i>

39:53.627 --> 39:55.322
to Queen Isabella
and her family.

39:55.795 --> 39:57.228
<i>They're so mysterious.</i>

39:57.898 --> 40:02.995
<i>So true. I want to find out more
about Gardania's magical crown.</i>

40:03.737 --> 40:05.466
Isla mentioned that before.

40:05.872 --> 40:07.339
<i>Emily would
love that story.</i>

40:07.507 --> 40:09.099
Oh! Tell her the legend.

40:09.709 --> 40:14.078
<i>It's said that the crown glows when
placed on the true heir of Gardania.</i>

40:14.548 --> 40:17.449
<i>It lit up on Queen Isabella's
head at her coronation,</i>

40:17.784 --> 40:20.150
<i>but it hasn't been
seen since then.</i>

40:23.523 --> 40:24.820
All done!

40:25.659 --> 40:27.183
These are beautiful.

40:27.861 --> 40:29.158
<i>Thanks.</i>

40:30.797 --> 40:31.991
<i>We should go.</i>

40:32.098 --> 40:34.828
The earlier we get to the
palace, the more we can see.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.436
<i>Our uniforms.</i>

40:51.952 --> 40:53.715
<i>Every one is in shreds!</i>

40:56.222 --> 40:57.780
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

40:57.857 --> 41:00.655
<i>We're not allowed in class
without our uniforms.</i>

41:01.094 --> 41:03.426
And if we skip a class,
we get an F.

41:04.197 --> 41:05.562
<i>We can't fail!</i>

41:05.832 --> 41:08.426
Coronation Day
is two days away!

41:09.869 --> 41:11.461
How could this happen?

41:12.005 --> 41:15.099
Seriously? It was Delancy. It had to be.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.833
<i>She's the queen of
"Make Blair Feel Inferior. "</i>

41:18.478 --> 41:20.002
<i>No. She's not.</i>

41:20.780 --> 41:22.907
No one can make you
feel inferior.

41:23.383 --> 41:24.873
Not without your consent.

41:26.319 --> 41:27.877
<i>We're princesses, right?</i>

41:28.355 --> 41:29.982
<i>We don't even have
our crowns yet.</i>

41:30.357 --> 41:31.346
And you...

41:31.725 --> 41:35.525
<i>I'm not talking about crowns.
I'm talking about character.</i>

41:36.129 --> 41:39.656
The rule is we have to show
up to class in uniform, right?

41:40.133 --> 41:42.829
<i>Currently they're
a little too breezy.</i>

41:43.670 --> 41:47.071
Hmm. They just need
a little alteration.

41:48.241 --> 41:50.175
Grace! Caprice! Harmony!

41:52.012 --> 41:54.139
<i>Won't that
make them breezier?</i>

42:09.629 --> 42:13.360
Hmm. It seems Blair, Hadley,
and Isla are running late.

42:13.566 --> 42:15.534
<i>I do hope they're
not skipping class.</i>

42:15.602 --> 42:18.571
<i>I'd hate to fail anyone
so close to Coronation Day.</i>

42:20.573 --> 42:21.938
<i>Well, time's up.</i>

42:22.275 --> 42:23.936
Oh, come now,
Dame Devin.

42:24.277 --> 42:26.711
I think we can wait
a few minutes more.

42:27.213 --> 42:28.703
And keep the
other students waiting?

42:28.782 --> 42:30.113
That hardly seems fair.

42:30.250 --> 42:32.309
<i>I'm afraid we'll have to
fail all three of them.</i>

42:32.385 --> 42:33.374
<i>Wait!</i>

42:35.255 --> 42:37.689
<i>What do you think
you're wearing?</i>

42:37.757 --> 42:39.418
<i>Those aren't school-issued
uniforms.</i>

42:40.193 --> 42:42.525
Forgive me, madam,
but they are, in fact,

42:42.629 --> 42:45.359
made entirely from the material
in our original uniforms.

42:45.765 --> 42:47.562
<i>But that's against the rules.</i>

42:47.701 --> 42:51.967
<i>Actually, Dame Devin, there is nothing in
the dress code against what they've done.</i>

42:52.272 --> 42:55.639
<i>Right. We just used some hard work
to unlock our princess potential.</i>

42:56.342 --> 42:58.242
<i>And beautifully, at that.</i>

42:58.545 --> 43:00.035
Come, join the class.

43:19.299 --> 43:20.857
<i>Awesome!</i>

43:22.736 --> 43:24.294
<i>Where did you get
new uniforms?</i>

43:24.437 --> 43:26.302
Those are amazing!

43:26.439 --> 43:27.463
<i>We made them.</i>

43:27.574 --> 43:29.132
Blair made them.

43:30.510 --> 43:32.068
How did you do that?

43:32.779 --> 43:34.076
I want one.

43:34.581 --> 43:36.708
<i>I didn't know
people made clothes.</i>

43:37.217 --> 43:40.516
I thought they came from
elves. You know, like toast.

43:41.521 --> 43:42.954
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

43:43.423 --> 43:46.654
<i>Welcome to the royal
palace of Gardania.</i>

43:47.527 --> 43:51.019
As a special treat you will
have some time before the meal

43:51.231 --> 43:53.927
to explore the first
floor of the palace.

43:55.001 --> 43:56.366
<i>Enjoy!</i>

43:57.670 --> 44:00.798
<i>Sweet. Royal secrets,
here we come!</i>

44:07.313 --> 44:09.247
No way.

44:09.849 --> 44:12.545
<i>Blair. It's a
picture of Blair.</i>

44:13.453 --> 44:15.444
<i>That's not possible.</i>

44:15.922 --> 44:17.549
<i>Why would there be
a portrait of me?</i>

44:20.794 --> 44:23.262
<i>"Princess Isabella, age 18."</i>

44:32.839 --> 44:33.828
That dog.

44:34.607 --> 44:35.665
<i>It couldn't be!</i>

44:37.243 --> 44:39.541
<i>"Queen Isabella,
King Reginald,</i>

44:40.046 --> 44:42.981
<i>"the Princess Sophia,
and their loyal dog,</i>

44:43.917 --> 44:45.043
<i>"Prince. "</i>

44:45.552 --> 44:46.917
No way!

44:47.554 --> 44:50.546
Blair? Do you know when your
mom found you on her doorstep?

44:50.824 --> 44:51.950
The date? Sure.

44:52.325 --> 44:54.657
<i>I mean, she made it my birthday
since she didn't know my real one.</i>

44:54.961 --> 44:56.155
April 26th.

44:58.398 --> 44:59.490
<i>What?</i>

44:59.933 --> 45:03.596
<i>Blair, you know what
April 26th is, don't you?</i>

45:04.504 --> 45:05.937
<i>Um, yeah.</i>

45:06.673 --> 45:08.868
My birthday.
I just said that.

45:09.676 --> 45:12.304
<i>It's the day the royal
family died in that car crash.</i>

45:14.647 --> 45:17.844
<i>I'm thinking maybe baby Sophia
didn't die in that crash.</i>

45:18.117 --> 45:21.609
<i>Maybe she was found and
left on someone's doorstep.</i>

45:22.288 --> 45:23.312
No!

45:23.590 --> 45:25.217
Yes, look at the portrait.

45:25.358 --> 45:27.519
You look exactly
like Queen Isabella!

45:27.827 --> 45:29.727
You could be
baby Sophia.

45:30.597 --> 45:33.498
<i>If it's true, and Dame Devin
and Delancy know it,</i>

45:33.867 --> 45:36.062
<i>that would explain why
they're so awful to you,</i>

45:36.236 --> 45:40.002
<i>because you're the rightful heir
to the throne, and not Delancy!</i>

45:43.376 --> 45:44.604
Okay.

45:44.811 --> 45:47.143
<i>That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.</i>

45:49.515 --> 45:51.176
<i>Dinner time!
We've gotta go.</i>

45:52.485 --> 45:54.385
<i>This is serious,
you know.</i>

45:54.854 --> 45:57.015
The whole fate of
Gardania is at stake.

45:57.724 --> 46:00.192
<i>Come on, you guys.
It's crazy.</i>

46:21.314 --> 46:22.576
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

46:29.989 --> 46:30.978
<i>Excuse me!</i>

46:32.225 --> 46:36.685
<i>My daughter has a declaration about how she'll
handle things when she's crowned princess</i>

46:36.896 --> 46:38.158
in two days.

46:38.264 --> 46:39.253
Delancy!

46:40.600 --> 46:41.624
Huh?

46:41.901 --> 46:43.027
I, um...

46:43.536 --> 46:44.525
Uh...

46:45.138 --> 46:46.127
I...

46:46.572 --> 46:49.700
<i>My brilliant daughter noticed
that Gardania's poorer sections</i>

46:49.776 --> 46:52.540
are a blight to the otherwise
beautiful community.

46:52.912 --> 46:54.573
Hey!

46:54.781 --> 46:57.215
To remedy this she will
take over those areas,

46:57.350 --> 47:01.719
bulldoze the buildings, and turn the
land into beautiful rolling parks,

47:01.888 --> 47:04.880
full of trees and grass,
and streams.

47:05.191 --> 47:07.159
<i>Wonderful for the environment.</i>

47:07.827 --> 47:11.319
But people live in those
areas you just knocked down.

47:12.065 --> 47:13.760
My neighborhood is there.

47:14.300 --> 47:15.289
It is?

47:15.702 --> 47:17.397
Delancy is
aware of that.

47:17.470 --> 47:19.267
Those people will
move elsewhere.

47:19.906 --> 47:21.840
<i>How? They're like me.</i>

47:22.141 --> 47:24.974
<i>They don't have money. They
can't just pick up and move.</i>

47:25.111 --> 47:27.272
<i>If I were you I'd leave
this school immediately</i>

47:27.347 --> 47:29.247
and get my family
ready to move.

47:30.717 --> 47:31.945
Delancy?

47:44.897 --> 47:47.058
I think it is disgraceful.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.927
Duly noted.

47:49.702 --> 47:53.695
Now, shall we continue
our lesson in dinner manners?

47:55.808 --> 47:58.436
<i>Right, then, students,</i>

47:58.544 --> 48:00.535
we will start
with our salads.

48:00.780 --> 48:03.340
Outermost forks.
You may begin.

48:13.793 --> 48:14.782
<i>Let's go.</i>

48:46.692 --> 48:48.717
Blair, are you okay?

48:49.495 --> 48:50.928
<i>I'm better than okay.</i>

48:51.531 --> 48:52.691
<i>I'm ready.</i>

48:52.765 --> 48:54.027
<i>Ready for what?</i>

48:54.534 --> 48:55.523
To fight.

48:55.902 --> 48:58.962
<i>If Delancy gets on the throne
she's going to ruin my family,</i>

48:59.238 --> 49:01.206
and probably this
kingdom along with it.

49:01.574 --> 49:03.235
If she gets on the throne?

49:03.843 --> 49:07.404
<i>She can't, if we can prove
someone else is the rightful heir.</i>

49:08.114 --> 49:09.877
<i>Gardania's magical crown.</i>

49:10.917 --> 49:12.851
<i>It must be
in the palace. Right?</i>

49:17.423 --> 49:20.950
The crown glows when placed
on the true heir of Gardania.

49:21.494 --> 49:24.861
<i>But we have to find it
before Delancy's coronation.</i>

49:25.164 --> 49:27.724
So we have to find
the crown...

49:27.800 --> 49:28.858
Tonight.

49:32.772 --> 49:33.966
<i>It's time.</i>

49:37.110 --> 49:38.577
Do we have
everything we need?

49:39.178 --> 49:40.167
Game on.

49:41.781 --> 49:42.941
<i>What's that?</i>

49:43.950 --> 49:45.076
<i>What's going on?</i>

49:45.151 --> 49:47.176
<i>Fire drill! Fire drill!
There's no time!</i>

49:47.253 --> 49:49.414
Single file!
In a line!

49:51.724 --> 49:53.954
<i>Hmm. I don't see
a fire drill on the schedule.</i>

49:54.560 --> 49:56.460
<i>What about the plan?</i>

49:57.563 --> 49:59.292
<i>We wait a little longer.</i>

49:59.365 --> 50:01.356
Hopefully,
this will be fast.

50:20.887 --> 50:24.084
<i>Lovely day for a surprise
fire drill, isn't it, darling?</i>

50:25.358 --> 50:27.553
Mom, what did you do?

50:29.629 --> 50:31.859
<i>Oh! What have you
done to your uniform?</i>

50:32.431 --> 50:33.796
I like it, Mother.

50:34.367 --> 50:35.595
Ugh! Come on.

50:35.768 --> 50:37.827
<i>Let's join
the others outside.</i>

50:40.806 --> 50:44.640
<i>Attention, students! You
may now return to your rooms!</i>

50:45.378 --> 50:46.811
How much time
did we lose?

50:47.113 --> 50:48.102
Thirty minutes.

50:48.481 --> 50:52.508
Plus another 15 minutes trying to
untangle Portia from the tether ball pole.

50:53.186 --> 50:54.346
<i>Let's go.</i>

50:58.658 --> 51:00.819
<i>Thieves! They're thieves,
I tell you.</i>

51:01.227 --> 51:02.216
Huh?

51:02.762 --> 51:04.093
Arrest them.

51:04.297 --> 51:05.286
<i>What?</i>

51:05.431 --> 51:07.956
<i>I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake,</i>

51:08.334 --> 51:11.201
but Dame Devin believes
you stole her jewelry.

51:11.871 --> 51:13.600
No! I would never!

51:13.706 --> 51:16.903
Not to save your poor family
about to lose their home?

51:17.076 --> 51:18.065
I doubt that.

51:18.411 --> 51:20.845
Plus my daughter,
Delancy, saw you.

51:21.681 --> 51:25.549
<i>Didn't you tell me you saw Blair poking
around in my office the other day?</i>

51:26.352 --> 51:27.819
<i>I don't...</i>

51:28.254 --> 51:30.950
<i>I don't remember exactly,
but...</i>

51:34.961 --> 51:36.861
Yes. Yes, I did.

51:40.199 --> 51:42.531
I demand you
search their room.

51:42.802 --> 51:43.894
<i>What?</i>

51:44.003 --> 51:45.334
<i>Girls, it's procedure.</i>

51:45.404 --> 51:48.339
<i>If you have nothing
to hide, it shouldn't matter.</i>

52:03.923 --> 52:05.390
Look what I found.

52:08.728 --> 52:10.389
My jewelry!

52:11.364 --> 52:12.456
<i>That's not...</i>

52:12.832 --> 52:14.925
<i>I didn't put that there.</i>

52:15.935 --> 52:17.334
<i>Here's another.</i>

52:19.205 --> 52:20.433
No way!

52:21.107 --> 52:22.301
One more.

52:24.443 --> 52:26.240
<i>We didn't steal anything.</i>

52:26.579 --> 52:28.137
<i>Don't lie. It's unbecoming.</i>

52:28.447 --> 52:29.436
Lock them up.

52:29.815 --> 52:32.045
Headmistress Privet,
I promise you.

52:32.318 --> 52:33.649
<i>With the evidence
and the witness</i>

52:33.719 --> 52:35.380
<i>I'm afraid I have
no choice.</i>

52:35.454 --> 52:37.854
Brock, take them
to the detaining room.

52:37.923 --> 52:38.981
No!

52:39.091 --> 52:42.083
<i>We can't investigate until
after the ceremony tomorrow.</i>

52:42.194 --> 52:45.095
You will remain
detained until that time.

52:45.765 --> 52:46.754
Detained?

52:47.266 --> 52:48.665
As in, locked up?

52:49.302 --> 52:50.894
During the coronation?

52:51.170 --> 52:52.467
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

52:53.139 --> 52:56.472
Unless there is another
way to explain this.

52:58.711 --> 52:59.769
Hmm.

53:00.112 --> 53:01.977
How very disappointing.

53:02.782 --> 53:03.771
<i>I'll say.</i>

53:04.183 --> 53:05.377
Brock!

53:27.373 --> 53:29.500
Isla, Hadley,

53:30.276 --> 53:31.675
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

53:32.645 --> 53:34.738
Now neither of you
will become princesses.

53:35.648 --> 53:36.637
<i>Don't sweat it.</i>

53:37.116 --> 53:38.913
<i>Who needs a tiara anyway?</i>

53:39.051 --> 53:40.678
They just make
your head itch.

53:40.953 --> 53:43.786
<i>And it's not easy to kick
a ball in four-inch heels.</i>

53:44.357 --> 53:45.585
<i>Brock, stop!</i>

53:47.727 --> 53:50.059
<i>I've got something else
in mind for the prisoners.</i>

53:50.396 --> 53:52.057
You may turn them
over to me.

53:53.132 --> 53:54.326
But my orders...

53:54.734 --> 53:58.067
<i>Will officially come from me
in only a few hours.</i>

53:58.904 --> 54:00.064
The keys?

54:01.674 --> 54:03.369
<i>They're all yours.</i>

54:03.843 --> 54:05.572
Thank you. You may go.

54:09.515 --> 54:12.541
<i>If this is your way or rubbing
it in, you don't have to.</i>

54:12.818 --> 54:13.876
<i>You've won.</i>

54:13.953 --> 54:15.181
Yeah, we get it.

54:15.554 --> 54:17.545
<i>What are you...</i>

54:17.623 --> 54:19.147
<i>I'm supposed to be asleep.</i>

54:19.892 --> 54:20.881
Tell me,

54:22.161 --> 54:24.561
are you really
Princess Sophia?

54:25.531 --> 54:27.795
<i>I... I don't know for sure.</i>

54:28.768 --> 54:30.030
But I think so.

54:30.569 --> 54:32.230
I think so, too.

54:32.872 --> 54:34.737
This is a map
of the palace basement.

54:34.807 --> 54:37.105
<i>There's something
of yours inside the vault.</i>

54:38.411 --> 54:40.504
<i>Gardania's magical crown?</i>

54:41.046 --> 54:42.411
<i>You have to get it.</i>

54:42.782 --> 54:45.342
Let everyone know
the truth before coronation.

54:45.818 --> 54:47.410
<i>Once I'm crowned,
it's too late.</i>

54:47.653 --> 54:49.416
<i>Gardania's mine for life.</i>

54:49.922 --> 54:51.184
<i>You don't want that?</i>

54:51.557 --> 54:52.922
<i>I want what's right.</i>

54:53.159 --> 54:55.423
I have to get back. My
mother will be looking for me.

54:55.928 --> 54:56.952
Thank you.

54:57.062 --> 54:59.553
<i>I'll leave a window open
for you on the third floor.</i>

54:59.765 --> 55:01.096
Good luck.

55:23.122 --> 55:24.384
Hey, Prince.

55:29.028 --> 55:31.496
<i>Aw, don't look
at me like that.</i>

55:33.265 --> 55:36.257
<i>I can't play
fetch, I'm on duty.</i>

55:38.370 --> 55:39.394
Hey!

55:39.839 --> 55:42.967
Prince. Prince. No, no.
Prince, come here. I gotta work.

55:43.108 --> 55:44.905
Prince. Prince. Come on.

55:45.144 --> 55:46.270
Come here.

55:51.183 --> 55:53.048
<i>That's the window.</i>

55:53.118 --> 55:54.676
<i>Let's hope Delancy did
what she said she would.</i>

56:03.128 --> 56:04.959
<i>You're sure this will work?</i>

56:05.030 --> 56:07.624
<i>Positive! Just hold on tight
and don't look down.</i>

56:16.642 --> 56:17.939
<i>Come.
Come on. Come on.</i>

56:18.644 --> 56:19.838
Come on.

56:20.212 --> 56:21.543
Prince, hey.

56:21.914 --> 56:23.711
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

56:24.283 --> 56:25.511
Come back here!

56:31.590 --> 56:34.024
The elevator should be
right down this hall.

56:38.564 --> 56:41.192
<i>It's time for
you to be asleep, Delancy.</i>

56:41.333 --> 56:43.198
<i>You've a big day tomorrow.</i>

57:13.132 --> 57:14.292
<i>Don't move.</i>

57:14.366 --> 57:15.856
<i>What now?</i>

57:17.136 --> 57:19.400
<i>Laser alarm.
We've got 'em at home.</i>

57:19.672 --> 57:22.072
If we break the beams,
alarms go off.

57:22.575 --> 57:24.566
<i>I can't see any beams.</i>

57:25.444 --> 57:27.912
Perhaps a little
touch up will help.

57:36.855 --> 57:37.844
<i>Nice.</i>

57:38.257 --> 57:40.657
So, how good
are you guys at gymnastics?

57:41.193 --> 57:42.626
I do a mean tree pose.

57:43.262 --> 57:45.025
I think I can
do a somersault.

57:46.332 --> 57:47.492
Follow me.

57:53.539 --> 57:54.767
<i>Whoa!</i>

58:05.851 --> 58:08.411
<i>No!
This way.</i>

58:12.424 --> 58:13.789
Careful!

58:15.728 --> 58:17.320
Huh?
Okay.

58:19.231 --> 58:20.528
<i>No, no. Whoa!</i>

58:58.570 --> 59:03.337
<i>Welcome, Dame Devin.
Your security is our priority.</i>

59:03.842 --> 59:05.400
<i>Please enter your password.</i>

59:05.778 --> 59:06.802
Password?

59:08.047 --> 59:10.447
<i>Try something.
What would Dame Devin choose?</i>

59:10.749 --> 59:12.410
<i>Delancy's coronation day?</i>

59:12.751 --> 59:14.150
<i>Today's date.</i>

59:20.559 --> 59:22.254
<i>You seem
to be having trouble.</i>

59:22.394 --> 59:24.259
<i>Would you like your
password hint?</i>

59:24.630 --> 59:25.790
Yes.

59:26.165 --> 59:27.427
<i>Your hint is,</i>

59:27.666 --> 59:30.191
<i>"The day it all
fell into place. "</i>

59:30.302 --> 59:32.770
<i>Ten seconds
until your lockdown.</i>

59:33.105 --> 59:34.936
<i>The day it all fell into
place? Nine, eight...</i>

59:35.107 --> 59:36.233
<i>What does that mean?
... seven, six...</i>

59:36.308 --> 59:38.799
<i>Wait. "The day it
all fell into place. "</i>

59:39.178 --> 59:41.840
<i>The day Dame Devin's
plans started working.</i>

59:42.081 --> 59:43.981
The day of the car crash.

59:49.955 --> 59:51.354
<i>Thank you, Dame Devin.</i>

59:52.024 --> 59:53.184
<i>Enjoy.</i>

01:00:11.777 --> 01:00:13.005
Not in here!

01:00:29.895 --> 01:00:33.695
Hadley, Isla, look!

01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:36.991
<i>Gardania's magical crown!</i>

01:00:41.974 --> 01:00:44.465
How do we get it
out of the case?

01:00:44.743 --> 01:00:45.903
<i>You won't.</i>

01:00:47.279 --> 01:00:49.873
<i>But I shouldn't have
too much trouble with it.</i>

01:01:06.899 --> 01:01:09.459
<i>Goodbye, Blair.</i>

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.135
<i>Enjoy Coronation Day.</i>

01:01:19.778 --> 01:01:21.006
<i>No!</i>

01:01:22.314 --> 01:01:25.215
<i>That's it.
We're sunk.</i>

01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:34.215
<i>Well, Phil, here it is.</i>

01:01:34.293 --> 01:01:37.023
<i>The day we've all
been waiting for!</i>

01:01:37.095 --> 01:01:38.426
<i>My birthday?</i>

01:01:42.868 --> 01:01:44.495
<i>No,
it's Coronation Day.</i>

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.834
<i>Even now, our beloved
princesses-in-training</i>

01:01:46.905 --> 01:01:50.238
<i>are pulling into the royal palace
to receive their royal crowns</i>

01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:52.106
<i>on their royal heads.</i>

01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:18.731
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:02:18.871 --> 01:02:22.898
I welcome you to
our annual Graduation

01:02:22.975 --> 01:02:25.136
and Coronation Day...
This will be the best

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:28.646
<i>Coronation Day ever,
don't you think?</i>

01:02:54.473 --> 01:02:57.636
Grace, go find Miss Privet
and tell her where we are.

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:22.426
Now, what are we
going to do?

01:03:25.871 --> 01:03:28.169
You are hereby dubbed

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.903
<i>Lady Royal Josette
of Zinnia.</i>

01:03:41.086 --> 01:03:43.179
You are hereby dubbed

01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:45.422
Princess Miranda

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.981
of Philadelphia.

01:03:48.694 --> 01:03:51.060
You are hereby dubbed

01:03:51.129 --> 01:03:54.496
Princess Portia
of Narcissia.

01:04:03.075 --> 01:04:05.600
Ugh! There is no service
at all down here.

01:04:16.355 --> 01:04:18.482
<i>Hmm. What's this?</i>

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:21.517
Stand back!

01:04:32.704 --> 01:04:35.730
If only there was a
keypad inside the vault.

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:39.136
Maybe there is!

01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:50.745
Standing before me now

01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:52.790
is Delancy Devin,

01:04:52.858 --> 01:04:56.055
who will now
govern our beloved

01:04:56.128 --> 01:04:59.495
and flourishing
country, Gardania.

01:05:00.732 --> 01:05:04.065
Delancy, I now crown you

01:05:04.136 --> 01:05:05.763
<i>Princess of...
Wait!</i>

01:05:05.837 --> 01:05:08.032
<i>Uh... Proper
princess protocol!</i>

01:05:08.106 --> 01:05:10.973
The bylaws state that before
a new princess can be crowned,

01:05:11.043 --> 01:05:13.511
the entire assembly must
spin around seven times,

01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:15.978
in honor of the seven
hills of Gardania.

01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:17.207
<i>What is she doing?</i>

01:05:17.282 --> 01:05:18.340
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:05:18.417 --> 01:05:20.715
<i>What are you doing?
You need to be crowned!</i>

01:05:20.819 --> 01:05:24.255
<i>I just... Uh...
Want to do it properly.</i>

01:05:26.558 --> 01:05:28.185
Spin, you say?

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:33.362
<i>It is indeed
proper protocol.</i>

01:05:33.965 --> 01:05:37.765
In honor of the seven
hills of Gardania,

01:05:37.836 --> 01:05:41.772
let us rise and spin
around seven times!

01:05:53.618 --> 01:05:54.915
<i>I got it!</i>

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.215
<i>The phone's linked up
with the keypad.</i>

01:05:58.223 --> 01:06:00.623
Day of the car crash.

01:06:03.528 --> 01:06:06.861
Ugh! Dame Devin must
have changed the code.

01:06:06.932 --> 01:06:08.229
<i>You're right!</i>

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.791
I heard Dame Devin change it
when the doors were closing.

01:06:11.103 --> 01:06:12.536
I heard it too!

01:06:15.173 --> 01:06:17.403
<i>That's what I've been
humming this whole time.</i>

01:06:17.476 --> 01:06:19.239
Let me see the phone.

01:06:20.645 --> 01:06:22.704
Do, re, mi...

01:06:25.517 --> 01:06:26.814
Ah! I got it!

01:06:37.896 --> 01:06:39.295
<i>Woo!
Yes!</i>

01:06:39.698 --> 01:06:40.824
<i>We did it!</i>

01:06:44.703 --> 01:06:46.967
Now, hop on one foot

01:06:47.038 --> 01:06:49.802
to honor those who
have hopped before us.

01:07:10.295 --> 01:07:11.557
Bless you.

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:17.324
<i>Hey! What are
you doing here?</i>

01:07:25.343 --> 01:07:29.370
And now everyone must pat his head
and rub his stomach at the same time.

01:07:31.249 --> 01:07:32.477
<i>Enough!</i>

01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:35.280
The protocols have been
satisfied! Crown her!

01:07:52.337 --> 01:07:53.361
<i>Wait!</i>

01:07:58.577 --> 01:08:00.374
No! Do not wait!

01:08:01.279 --> 01:08:03.679
I am making a claim
to the throne,

01:08:03.748 --> 01:08:06.114
because I am
Princess Sophia,

01:08:06.184 --> 01:08:08.175
daughter of
Queen Isabella!

01:08:14.226 --> 01:08:16.558
You know, there
is a resemblance.

01:08:16.627 --> 01:08:18.255
This is ridiculous!

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.992
The princess died
17 years ago.

01:08:21.066 --> 01:08:22.363
Finish the coronation

01:08:22.434 --> 01:08:25.493
and make Princess Delancy
ruler of Gardania for life!

01:08:25.937 --> 01:08:29.337
Dame Devin, this is a serious
claim and we have to...

01:08:29.407 --> 01:08:31.466
<i>We have to crown
my daughter.</i>

01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:40.983
Come on!

01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:46.886
Oh! Get away!

01:08:59.837 --> 01:09:00.895
Hah!

01:10:39.938 --> 01:10:42.031
It is Princess Sophia!

01:10:45.844 --> 01:10:47.539
You useless child!

01:10:47.612 --> 01:10:49.807
<i>Do you have any idea
what you've done?</i>

01:10:50.281 --> 01:10:53.808
<i>I eliminated Queen Isabella so
you could be princess one day.</i>

01:11:00.158 --> 01:11:02.991
<i>No, that's not what I meant.</i>

01:11:03.628 --> 01:11:06.597
Guards, please
take her away.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:11.867
<i>No! You can't
do this to me!</i>

01:11:11.936 --> 01:11:13.870
Get your hands off me!

01:11:14.406 --> 01:11:16.306
You have to crown Delancy!

01:11:16.374 --> 01:11:17.932
You have to!

01:11:18.009 --> 01:11:19.271
<i>You'll pay for this!</i>

01:11:27.152 --> 01:11:30.781
Blair... That is,
Princess Sophia,

01:11:31.423 --> 01:11:35.484
is there anything you would
like to say to your new subjects?

01:11:53.044 --> 01:11:54.375
Hello.

01:11:54.846 --> 01:11:57.110
<i>I'm just a regular girl.</i>

01:11:57.549 --> 01:11:59.642
But I think Headmistress
Privet is right

01:12:00.018 --> 01:12:03.681
when she says every girl
has princess potential.

01:12:04.956 --> 01:12:07.754
It is an honor
to be your princess.

01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:19.595
Blair, this is when
the Princess of Gardania

01:12:19.671 --> 01:12:21.366
chooses her lady royal.

01:12:21.439 --> 01:12:23.703
<i>Now, I know it's
an important decision,</i>

01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:25.367
so if you need
more time, then...

01:12:25.443 --> 01:12:27.434
I already know
who I want.

01:12:29.647 --> 01:12:31.945
It would be
an incredible privilege

01:12:32.016 --> 01:12:33.711
if my lady royal
could be

01:12:35.153 --> 01:12:36.313
Delancy.

01:12:41.326 --> 01:12:44.261
But Blair, why me?

01:12:44.929 --> 01:12:46.988
I was horrible to you.

01:12:47.966 --> 01:12:51.265
<i>I wouldn't be wearing this
crown without your help.</i>

01:12:51.336 --> 01:12:52.860
<i>Will you accept?</i>

01:12:54.873 --> 01:12:57.671
I would be honored,
Your Highness.

01:13:01.946 --> 01:13:04.312
<i>Lady Royal Delancy</i>

01:13:04.382 --> 01:13:06.043
of Gardania.

01:13:24.769 --> 01:13:26.566
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:13:26.638 --> 01:13:29.004
<i>royals of all ages,</i>

01:13:29.073 --> 01:13:30.904
<i>and dogs,</i>

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:34.538
<i>it's time to party!</i>

01:13:40.685 --> 01:13:43.586
<i>Here's a special track
I wrote myself.</i>

01:13:43.688 --> 01:13:45.280
Hope you like it!

01:13:48.126 --> 01:13:50.253
<i>All of us</i>

01:13:50.328 --> 01:13:52.523
<i>Fabulous</i>

01:13:52.597 --> 01:13:54.656
<i>Put your hands in the air
All of us</i>

01:13:54.732 --> 01:13:56.563
<i>We rule, we rule this school</i>

01:13:56.634 --> 01:13:59.535
<i>We rule it
We rule it</i>

01:13:59.604 --> 01:14:01.037
<i>All of us</i>

01:14:01.105 --> 01:14:02.402
<i>Fabulous</i>

01:14:02.473 --> 01:14:05.442
<i>And this is how we do it...</i>

01:14:06.911 --> 01:14:09.744
<i>No way! You're
spinning your tunes?</i>

01:14:10.181 --> 01:14:12.012
It was totally time.

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.512
I love it!

01:14:14.152 --> 01:14:15.551
Hey, Blair,

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.950
<i>don't look now,
but look now.</i>

01:14:23.061 --> 01:14:26.155
Congratulations,
Princess... Um...

01:14:26.431 --> 01:14:28.126
You can call me Blair.

01:14:28.199 --> 01:14:30.690
Congratulations
on your coronation, too,

01:14:30.768 --> 01:14:32.497
Prince Nicholas.

01:14:33.237 --> 01:14:36.934
<i>Wouldst thou do me
the honor of a dance?</i>

01:14:37.609 --> 01:14:40.077
I would be
most delighted.

01:14:43.615 --> 01:14:44.980
<i>Jump up, hands in the air</i>

01:14:45.216 --> 01:14:47.912
<i>Crowns on our head,
lighter than air</i>

01:14:49.921 --> 01:14:51.786
<i>Come on, now,
spin to the left</i>

01:14:51.856 --> 01:14:54.347
<i>Spin to the right,
we're graduating</i>

01:14:54.692 --> 01:14:56.990
<i>And it's our night</i>

01:14:58.296 --> 01:15:00.890
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:15:01.933 --> 01:15:04.561
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:08.503
<i>It's friendship
that makes us strong</i>

01:15:09.407 --> 01:15:11.068
<i>And we all belong</i>

01:15:11.142 --> 01:15:13.167
<i>Yeah, we all belong</i>

01:15:13.411 --> 01:15:15.538
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:15:15.613 --> 01:15:19.413
Your Highness? There are some
important people here to see you.

01:15:21.853 --> 01:15:24.151
<i>Emily! Mom!</i>

01:15:24.856 --> 01:15:26.187
Blair!

01:15:28.793 --> 01:15:30.090
Oh!

01:15:31.696 --> 01:15:34.597
<i>Welcome to our new home!</i>

01:15:35.466 --> 01:15:38.765
<i>Really? We get to live in the palace?</i>

01:15:39.303 --> 01:15:40.531
<i>We do.</i>

01:15:41.072 --> 01:15:42.505
Oh, Blair.

01:15:48.046 --> 01:15:50.776
<i>I know it's not exactly the
place we dreamed about...</i>

01:15:50.848 --> 01:15:51.906
Are you kidding?

01:15:51.983 --> 01:15:55.180
<i>It's better than anything
we ever dreamed about!</i>

01:15:55.687 --> 01:15:58.212
It is, now that
the two of you are here.

01:15:59.223 --> 01:16:00.451
Blair?

01:16:01.292 --> 01:16:03.283
<i>If you're
a princess now,</i>

01:16:03.361 --> 01:16:05.693
<i>does that mean
I'm a princess, too?</i>

01:16:05.763 --> 01:16:07.128
Of course.

01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:12.465
There is a princess
in every girl.

01:16:13.438 --> 01:16:16.373
Come on. I wanna
introduce you to everyone!

01:16:21.112 --> 01:16:22.636
<i>Jump up, hands in the air</i>

01:16:22.747 --> 01:16:25.580
<i>Crowns on our head,
lighter than air</i>

01:16:27.685 --> 01:16:29.277
<i>Come on, now,
spin to the left</i>

01:16:29.353 --> 01:16:31.651
<i>Spin to the right,
we're graduating</i>

01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:33.817
<i>And it's our night</i>

01:16:35.793 --> 01:16:38.318
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:42.831
<i>And we all belong
Yeah, we all belong</i>

01:16:43.267 --> 01:16:45.792
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:47.094
<i>All of us</i>

01:16:47.171 --> 01:16:49.469
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:50.632
<i>We're fabulous</i>

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:53.199
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:16:53.511 --> 01:16:54.603
<i>All of us</i>

01:16:54.679 --> 01:16:56.977
<i>We rule this school</i>

01:16:57.048 --> 01:16:58.606
<i>We're fabulous</i>

01:16:59.283 --> 01:17:00.875
<i>We're fabulous</i>

01:17:01.252 --> 01:17:02.685
<i>We're fabulous</i>

01:17:05.757 --> 01:17:08.021
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

01:17:09.193 --> 01:17:11.753
<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

01:17:12.697 --> 01:17:15.097
<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:19.360
<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

01:17:23.274 --> 01:17:25.469
<i>You can see it in her style</i>

01:17:26.711 --> 01:17:28.906
<i>You can see it in her smile</i>

01:17:29.981 --> 01:17:32.381
<i>You can see it in her flair</i>

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:36.248
<i>And the way she wears her hair</i>

01:17:39.423 --> 01:17:40.822
<i>Spinning</i>

01:17:41.192 --> 01:17:42.784
<i>Twirling</i>

01:17:42.927 --> 01:17:44.224
<i>Girly</i>
