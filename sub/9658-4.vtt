00:16.778 --> 00:18.738
Give us a lift, mate.

00:20.922 --> 00:22.522
Cheers, mate.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.837
Yes?

02:41.270 --> 02:42.830
Good morning.

02:44.575 --> 02:46.574
And to you.

02:47.099 --> 02:49.059
Come. Come in.

02:56.997 --> 02:59.636
I'm afraid I've caused
you a lot of trouble.

03:00.035 --> 03:02.995
No. Of course you haven't.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.688
You're cold. Here.

03:07.635 --> 03:09.875
Let's pop this on.

03:10.474 --> 03:12.233
Here we are.

03:12.836 --> 03:14.043
Please.

03:14.272 --> 03:15.952
Sit down.

03:22.204 --> 03:23.764
It seemed like, um...

03:25.180 --> 03:26.769
...you were close to
collapse last night.

03:26.795 --> 03:29.378
- Are you...?
- Feeling much better. Thank you.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.500
You don't need to be formal with me.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.340
I'm out of practice.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.140
I think we both are.

03:53.389 --> 03:55.549
I searched for you, you know.

03:56.674 --> 03:58.594
I knew you would.

03:58.841 --> 04:01.260
I searched. And searched.

04:03.164 --> 04:04.880
17 years I...

04:07.604 --> 04:09.860
All my contacts, right throughout Asia.

04:12.649 --> 04:13.939
I thought...

04:14.204 --> 04:16.540
I thought I'd lost you both.

04:19.456 --> 04:21.688
Oh, good Lord, of course you...

04:24.500 --> 04:26.179
Our Lee, she survived.

04:27.243 --> 04:28.803
She's alive.

04:29.580 --> 04:32.349
- What?!
- Yes.

04:32.857 --> 04:37.481
Our beautiful daughter, I saw
her just last year in China.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.979
- She can't be.
- Yes, she is!

04:42.573 --> 04:43.834
And...

04:44.157 --> 04:45.837
...she's a mother now.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.619
- Really?!
- Yes!

04:50.862 --> 04:51.932
- Yes!
- Lee?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.678
Yes, I promise you!

04:57.493 --> 05:00.652
Come. I know.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.891
I know.

05:03.977 --> 05:05.099
I know.

05:05.482 --> 05:07.802
Lucien? Not now, Jean.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.940
Ah, the Chief Superintendent is here.

05:14.932 --> 05:16.682
Please excuse me.

05:22.022 --> 05:22.957
- Frank.
- Lucien.

05:22.983 --> 05:24.410
Haven't caught you at
a bad time, I hope?

05:24.613 --> 05:25.604
Well, somewhat.

05:25.630 --> 05:27.549
Oh. Apologies. But can't be helped.

05:28.426 --> 05:29.939
You're required down at the racetrack.

05:29.940 --> 05:32.339
Apparently a rider's
taken a fall and...

05:32.340 --> 05:33.634
Do you really need me there?

05:33.660 --> 05:36.212
Please... Don't stay on my account.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.780
Chief Superintendent Frank Carlyle...

05:43.412 --> 05:45.532
...this is Mai Lin, my wife.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.540
Very pleased to meet you, Mai Lin.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.980
I'll get my things.

06:00.373 --> 06:01.932
Straightforward fall.

06:02.341 --> 06:03.994
Jockey died instantly.

06:04.188 --> 06:06.539
Alexander Martin. Doesn't ring a bell.

06:06.637 --> 06:08.299
Won the Ballarat Cup yesterday.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.179
Horse is in a bad way,
from what I hear.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.899
Really? Well, perhaps
you should call a vet.

06:13.316 --> 06:14.886
Perhaps I should.

06:15.260 --> 06:18.419
Straightforward, you say?

06:18.658 --> 06:19.859
Well, why do you want me there?

06:19.860 --> 06:21.460
Oh, just to keep an eye on things.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.620
So, your wife?

06:30.900 --> 06:32.579
Yes, Frank. It's...

06:33.283 --> 06:35.083
It's a very long story.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.180
Yes, I expect it is.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.225
Lucky Frank Carlyle.

07:30.814 --> 07:31.976
Terrible business.

07:32.544 --> 07:33.616
That it is, Terrence.

07:33.919 --> 07:35.232
Never get used to it.

07:35.444 --> 07:36.727
Ada's devastated.

07:37.439 --> 07:40.739
Favourite rider, favourite horse.
After yesterday's trial...

07:43.820 --> 07:46.667
Well, I'll... see you later, Terrence.

07:46.915 --> 07:48.675
That you will, Frank.

08:17.070 --> 08:18.459
Who else was out on the track with you?

08:18.460 --> 08:20.459
Just me. And Robyn was in the stables.

08:21.452 --> 08:22.889
Miss Heywood?

08:26.382 --> 08:28.600
Bradley Tennant. I manage the track.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.634
Lucien Blake, our police surgeon.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.601
How do you do?

08:32.203 --> 08:34.596
I'm guessing a fractured spine, Doctor?

08:34.621 --> 08:37.315
Well... A little too early to say.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.938
Robyn Dawson, Shane Heywood.

08:40.940 --> 08:42.530
Did you see him fall?

08:42.561 --> 08:44.468
Nah. I just heard the horse screamin'.

08:44.494 --> 08:46.497
I got there, then Robyn
come running up.

08:46.888 --> 08:48.154
He was dead when we got to him.

08:48.647 --> 08:50.762
Right. Alright, well,
thank you very much.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.220
Off you go.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.900
Ah, shame about Alex.

08:58.618 --> 09:02.098
Least he got to win his last race.
Small mercies.

09:03.820 --> 09:05.872
Had many falls here lately, Mr Tennant?

09:06.481 --> 09:09.282
Ballarat's a safe track for
a dangerous sport, Doctor.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.270
We take pride in that.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.620
I won't keep you.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.301
Gents, please.

09:26.886 --> 09:29.446
I'll manage, Terry, it's fine.

09:31.425 --> 09:32.984
You wanted to talk to me.

09:33.010 --> 09:34.882
Just a few questions
if you wouldn't mind.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.587
Of course.

09:36.690 --> 09:39.010
Could you tell me what time
the accident happened.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.959
I can't be sure. Um... It was
just after sunrise, I think.

09:44.210 --> 09:48.210
That's fine. Any idea what
may have caused the fall?

09:49.148 --> 09:50.578
No.

09:50.604 --> 09:53.707
He'd only just come back from a
bad fall at the Spring Carnival.

09:53.733 --> 09:57.493
- He said he was cleared to ride, Ada.
- Yes, I know, but... still.

09:58.686 --> 10:02.285
I just know that not being in the
saddle would almost drive him mad.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.290
It does sound like there
was no telling him.

10:05.829 --> 10:07.789
That's right. Thank you.

10:09.174 --> 10:10.893
Well, thank you, ma'am.

10:11.852 --> 10:15.649
And may I say... congratulations
on yesterday's win.

10:15.650 --> 10:18.049
It was thoroughly deserved.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.010
Oh. Thank you, Chief Superintendent.

10:21.644 --> 10:23.604
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

10:26.650 --> 10:28.649
Well... good day.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.461
Frank... If I didn't know better...

10:39.843 --> 10:41.422
Oh, shut up.

10:41.448 --> 10:43.608
Were you flirting with
her at the end there?

10:44.846 --> 10:46.525
Well, she's a handsome lady.

10:47.449 --> 10:51.544
You know, the first win I ever had
on a nag was on a horse she trained.

10:51.570 --> 10:53.329
Had a soft spot for her ever since.

10:53.488 --> 10:55.489
And what's she like as a person?

10:56.099 --> 10:59.333
Tough job, training horses.
Respect is hard-won.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.039
Especially if you're a woman.

11:01.984 --> 11:03.544
She's obviously got yours.

11:14.170 --> 11:15.969
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

11:15.970 --> 11:17.690
Come in.

11:18.879 --> 11:22.058
I've made breakfast. Bacon
and eggs, and there's toast.

11:22.450 --> 11:24.169
It's...

11:24.170 --> 11:26.164
...probably nothing
like you're used to.

11:26.190 --> 11:28.150
No, it sounds lovely.

11:29.785 --> 11:31.185
Please, sit.

11:35.518 --> 11:37.118
- Tea?
- Please.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.248
This is... marmalade?

11:47.458 --> 11:49.658
It's been such a long time.

11:51.869 --> 11:54.566
Oh, forgive my ignorance.
I never imagined...

11:54.600 --> 11:57.160
That a Chinese woman might
have a taste for marmalade?

11:59.713 --> 12:02.712
My father tried to be more
British than the British.

12:03.283 --> 12:05.203
A lot of us did.

12:05.961 --> 12:07.879
Reminds me of... childhood.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.722
Won't you join me?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.633
Oh, I'd better get to work.

12:18.110 --> 12:20.149
Is there anything else
you need, Mrs Blake?

12:20.690 --> 12:22.370
Thank you but no.

12:33.773 --> 12:37.732
Some of the damage to the vertebrae
appears to be antemortem.

12:38.126 --> 12:39.624
See?

12:39.915 --> 12:41.690
Signs of healing.

12:42.415 --> 12:47.365
Yes. Apparently, he'd just
come back after a nasty fall.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.968
So this morning's fall
exacerbates the damage

12:49.994 --> 12:51.550
and severs the spinal column.

12:51.576 --> 12:55.375
Yes. In fact, his doctors advised
him never to ride again.

12:56.536 --> 12:58.330
Then he should have known better.

13:00.478 --> 13:01.997
Contusion to the skull,

13:02.210 --> 13:04.169
rear left parietal.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.570
- From where the horse rolled on him?
- Possibly.

13:07.304 --> 13:09.743
Bruising in a band
across the lower ribs.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.290
Ah. Maybe he hit the railing.

13:14.095 --> 13:16.242
Wouldn't that be more generalised?
Well...

13:16.268 --> 13:17.907
Do you know how to cook?

13:18.906 --> 13:21.599
That may well be the strangest
thing you've ever asked me, Alice.

13:21.709 --> 13:24.490
I was told I should know how to cook.
Do you?

13:26.410 --> 13:27.969
Well, I...

13:28.184 --> 13:29.449
Not really, no.

13:29.450 --> 13:31.570
Oh. That's a shame.

13:32.252 --> 13:34.052
You might be right about that railing.

13:36.627 --> 13:37.692
Ready?

13:41.215 --> 13:43.490
Lungs, good condition.

13:44.207 --> 13:46.639
Not a smoker, by the looks.
Rare, for a jockey.

13:47.889 --> 13:49.728
Who said you should know how to cook?

13:50.410 --> 13:51.710
A registrar.

13:52.239 --> 13:53.299
Why?

13:53.958 --> 13:57.699
I was... entertaining
and I burnt some meat.

13:58.790 --> 14:01.229
Do you think Mrs Beazley
might teach me?

14:01.963 --> 14:03.127
Ah, if I could call her...

14:03.153 --> 14:04.491
You will not call.

14:07.153 --> 14:09.352
You'll come over for dinner, yes?

14:10.300 --> 14:11.737
Good.

14:11.930 --> 14:14.130
Alice, this is interesting.
Have a look.

14:14.993 --> 14:16.672
Partial rupture of the liver

14:17.359 --> 14:20.704
but there's a significant
amount of blood in the cavity.

14:20.730 --> 14:23.609
Which means it happened quite
some time prior to death.

14:24.016 --> 14:26.376
He must have been in tremendous pain.

14:28.730 --> 14:31.250
We should certainly make a
note of that, I think, Alice.

14:33.136 --> 14:34.696
Agnes?

14:37.050 --> 14:40.250
The young fool on the desk
told me to wait here.

14:41.239 --> 14:43.279
Um, thank you, Dr Harvey.

14:47.442 --> 14:48.974
Now...

14:50.704 --> 14:52.303
Everything alright?

14:52.390 --> 14:54.630
No, Lucien. It isn't.

14:57.290 --> 15:00.487
Y-You remember me talking to you...

15:00.786 --> 15:03.708
at hideous length, I'm sure...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.519
...about Lex?

15:06.302 --> 15:08.062
Yes, your nephew.

15:11.157 --> 15:12.877
He died this morning.

15:15.376 --> 15:19.939
Lex. Alex. Alex Martin. Goodness me.

15:21.441 --> 15:24.440
- I'm...
- Oh, do stop fussing. I'm fine.

15:24.933 --> 15:27.075
Foolishly, I didn't
make the connection.

15:27.101 --> 15:29.101
Well, why would you?

15:32.010 --> 15:36.347
I wanted to inform you that I will
take care of all funeral expenses.

15:36.610 --> 15:38.650
I'll pass it on. Do that.

15:40.223 --> 15:42.023
Agnes, forgive me for asking, but...

15:43.347 --> 15:45.746
...did Alex ever talk to you about

15:46.068 --> 15:49.027
anything questionable
going on at the track?

15:49.130 --> 15:52.930
Well, it's horse racing.
Everyone's questionable.

15:54.486 --> 15:59.045
He sustained an injury in
the hours before he died.

15:59.250 --> 16:03.410
The sort of thing typically
associated with fist fighting.

16:06.010 --> 16:07.789
The police told me he fell.

16:08.112 --> 16:10.192
On a training run. Is that true?

16:11.713 --> 16:12.845
Well...

16:12.917 --> 16:16.557
What experienced rider
falls on a training run?

16:21.410 --> 16:24.130
Very good. Keep going, keep going.
Come on.

16:27.963 --> 16:29.603
Keep going, that's it.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.136
Good girl.

16:34.162 --> 16:35.761
Come on.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.369
Whoa.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.090
Whoa, stop, stop, stop.

16:55.370 --> 16:58.290
Come on. Come on, girl.

16:59.930 --> 17:02.210
Good girl. That's it. Good girl.

18:31.621 --> 18:35.260
So, what you're saying is someone
strings up a cable across the track?

18:35.946 --> 18:37.624
Yes.

18:37.946 --> 18:41.449
Must have been reasonably thick.
A thinner wire would've...

18:41.450 --> 18:43.489
Well, would've caused
some kind of laceration.

18:43.846 --> 18:47.497
So Martin rides apace and
doesn't see the cable...

18:47.523 --> 18:49.002
Brings him down.

18:49.130 --> 18:52.650
His vertebrae are already weakened.

18:53.378 --> 18:55.097
And the fall severs his spine.

18:55.450 --> 18:57.009
So where's this cable?

18:57.010 --> 18:58.570
Tyre tracks, Frank.

18:59.316 --> 19:00.876
Recent, too.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.374
There you are, about 7'2".

19:11.507 --> 19:14.547
- And what was the injury to the horse?
- Just a broken leg, I hear.

19:16.168 --> 19:20.048
Right. The horse obviously
went under the wire...

19:21.586 --> 19:23.574
...and Alex took the
impact on his chest.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.584
Frank, did you know
something was going on?

19:27.610 --> 19:30.050
Is that why you dragged me
down here this morning?

19:35.478 --> 19:39.412
- I already told you all this.
- Won't take long, Mr Tennant.

19:39.438 --> 19:41.438
Just double-checking a
few facts, alright?

19:42.734 --> 19:44.813
So, who was on the track
this morning, sir?

19:45.330 --> 19:48.749
Myself. Ada had both the horses out.

19:48.775 --> 19:52.294
Shane Heywood and Alex Martin riding.

19:52.746 --> 19:54.362
What about Robyn Dawson?

19:54.388 --> 19:56.686
She was cleaning out the stables.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.312
You saw no-one else?

19:58.338 --> 20:01.404
I told you, no! Now,
I've got work to do.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.390
Trouble is, Mr Tennant...

20:03.837 --> 20:06.196
...Alex Martin's fall this
morning wasn't an accident.

20:06.658 --> 20:09.778
It's now a murder investigation, so
probably best you sit back down.

20:17.661 --> 20:21.581
Hello, Robyn. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to startle you.

20:26.086 --> 20:27.806
Beautiful animals, aren't they?

20:28.544 --> 20:30.223
Goodness me, it must've been...

20:31.097 --> 20:33.658
...terrible for you to see
that horse put down today.

20:33.684 --> 20:35.244
What was its name again?

20:36.232 --> 20:38.911
- Blue Monday. -Blue
Monday, that's right.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.210
Poor thing.

20:43.366 --> 20:45.326
Robyn, what... what
happened this morning?

20:47.319 --> 20:49.479
I saw Mr Tennant and he
was talking to Shane.

20:50.845 --> 20:53.549
The jockey who... who found Alex?

20:53.996 --> 20:56.715
And then Shane goes out onto
the track and he chases Alex.

20:56.810 --> 21:00.199
- Why did he chase him?
- Alex won the race yesterday.

21:01.189 --> 21:03.664
That's right. Shane came in second.

21:04.211 --> 21:06.070
He hates losing.

21:06.138 --> 21:09.698
Did they fight yesterday
after the race?

21:11.300 --> 21:13.020
Why are you asking all these question?

21:14.544 --> 21:18.863
Because someone strung a
cable across the track.

21:19.764 --> 21:21.433
It caused Alex to fall

21:21.459 --> 21:23.160
that's what killed him.

21:25.097 --> 21:26.937
And that's why Blue Monday died?

21:36.623 --> 21:39.155
Look, there were two riders on
the track, one of them fell.

21:39.181 --> 21:41.473
How would I know what happened?!
It was on the far turn!

21:43.269 --> 21:45.549
I think you've forgotten
your manners, Bradley.

21:47.370 --> 21:48.838
Now, it's a simple question.

21:48.864 --> 21:50.944
Did he have any enemies on the track?

21:55.029 --> 21:57.589
Perhaps you should
talk to Shane Heywood.

22:08.922 --> 22:10.481
Mr Heywood, how are you?

22:11.747 --> 22:14.933
When you punched Alex Martin
after the race yesterday

22:14.959 --> 22:16.479
you ruptured his liver.

22:17.387 --> 22:19.016
Were you trying to kill him?

22:20.687 --> 22:22.407
Is that what you were trying to do?

22:29.009 --> 22:30.689
Couldn't bloody wait, could you?

22:45.381 --> 22:47.621
It's alright, it's alright. He's alive.

22:53.064 --> 22:56.023
Apparently, he was pursuing
Alex Martin around the track

22:56.352 --> 22:57.992
prior to the race.

22:59.989 --> 23:02.108
Want me to take a statement
from Mrs McCrae?

23:02.890 --> 23:04.578
Nah, I'll go and do that, Bill.

23:04.604 --> 23:07.004
Why don't you go and talk
to that young stablehand?

23:13.552 --> 23:15.686
So, how'd they get on,
Martin and Heywood?

23:17.579 --> 23:19.409
Fierce rivals.

23:19.410 --> 23:21.209
But friendly, off the track.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.089
That's not what we heard.

23:23.090 --> 23:25.570
Well, who have you been talking to?

23:27.806 --> 23:29.286
Was it Robyn?

23:30.556 --> 23:33.035
You know she's not the
most sociable girl.

23:33.130 --> 23:36.369
She cares more for horses
than she does for people.

23:36.795 --> 23:38.022
Really?

23:38.048 --> 23:41.687
Alex is too hard with the whip and
Shane is too heavy with his boots.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.861
Then why does Mr Tennant
keep employing her?

23:44.610 --> 23:46.969
Well... her dad was a gifted jockey.

23:47.248 --> 23:51.610
He died in a fall on the
same stretch that took Alex.

23:54.190 --> 23:55.870
You didn't know that?

23:56.301 --> 23:58.580
You saw nothing suspicious
after the accident?

23:59.208 --> 24:00.605
Do you see this graze?!

24:00.630 --> 24:02.789
Not really, Miss Dawson.

24:02.936 --> 24:05.117
Did you see any vehicles
beside the track?

24:05.143 --> 24:07.142
You can feel it the fetlock's inflamed.

24:07.317 --> 24:09.538
Would you mind just
answering the question?

24:10.242 --> 24:10.906
Don't do that!

24:10.932 --> 24:13.467
This horse was injured while
you were chasing Shane

24:13.493 --> 24:14.797
and you're asking me about a car?!

24:14.823 --> 24:17.229
I really wouldn't do that
if I were you, Miss Dawson.

24:20.297 --> 24:21.897
Take this.

24:23.626 --> 24:26.345
No, I didn't see anything.

24:26.651 --> 24:28.331
Smile!

24:29.437 --> 24:31.957
The whole farmhand thing
suits you, Sergeant.

24:34.198 --> 24:36.784
I understand that the enquiry
into Alex Martin's death

24:36.810 --> 24:38.969
is being treated as suspicious...
care to comment?

24:39.251 --> 24:41.371
Not today, Miss Anderson.

24:46.581 --> 24:49.061
- How'd you get on with Miss Dawson?
- The girl's mad.

24:50.351 --> 24:52.280
And that journo's hanging round again.

24:52.330 --> 24:54.432
Oh, you gotta give her
full marks for effort.

24:54.458 --> 24:55.920
Did you search the stables?

24:55.946 --> 24:57.352
Top to bottom didn't find a thing.

24:57.378 --> 24:59.211
Alright, well, you head
back to the station.

24:59.237 --> 25:01.277
The doctor and I have a
personal call to make.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.235
Are you coming?

25:23.770 --> 25:25.250
Shorty?

25:27.599 --> 25:29.159
Cunningham.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.968
- Lucky Carlyle.
- Terry.

25:35.203 --> 25:37.199
Lucien Blake. Terry Noonan.

25:37.450 --> 25:40.649
Mr Noonan. Gets an
introduction this time.

25:40.650 --> 25:41.450
Indeed.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.163
This is a pleasure.

25:46.635 --> 25:48.914
Well, we're here to talk
about Alexander Martin.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.526
Had a favourite in yesterday's Cup.

25:51.730 --> 25:54.686
A great little horse. You won
some money, I believe...?

25:54.641 --> 25:56.975
Has Bradley Tennant been
on the phone to you?

25:59.449 --> 26:01.809
Well, then, you know why we're here.

26:02.337 --> 26:03.857
What can you tell us?

26:07.382 --> 26:08.902
Afternoon, Dutchy.

26:11.664 --> 26:14.304
It's alright. We're all friends
here, aren't we, Frank?

26:15.941 --> 26:17.981
Word is that Alex may
have had some enemies.

26:21.919 --> 26:24.279
Alright. Shane Heywood.

26:26.063 --> 26:29.582
No really bad blood, but
Heywood likes to win.

26:30.051 --> 26:31.411
Enough to harm him?

26:35.884 --> 26:38.403
Who else? Bradley Tennant?

26:39.018 --> 26:41.500
Bradley likes the sound
of his own voice.

26:41.796 --> 26:43.978
Do you... talk, Lucien?

26:44.848 --> 26:46.763
Too much, I'm told.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.913
Certainly getting on my nerves.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.248
Robyn Dawson.

26:54.342 --> 26:58.102
I knew her dad. She might do
something in the heat of the moment.

27:00.724 --> 27:01.498
This helping?

27:03.270 --> 27:05.761
Where were you this morning
when Alex Martin fell?

27:06.771 --> 27:09.658
At the track. And no, I
didn't see anything.

27:10.245 --> 27:11.363
Interesting.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.872
Anything else you might
know that could help?

27:15.579 --> 27:17.779
That's as much as I
can tell you, Frank.

27:20.964 --> 27:24.404
Blake, would you mind stepping
outside for the moment?

27:25.638 --> 27:26.877
It's alright.

27:27.712 --> 27:29.163
Not gonna bite me.

27:29.819 --> 27:32.219
Are you? Frank?

27:34.553 --> 27:36.872
Very good. Pleasure, Mr Noonan.

27:36.966 --> 27:38.526
Yeah. Lucien.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.403
Top shot. Ha!

27:48.040 --> 27:50.483
How are you? Um, just a beer, if I may?

27:51.231 --> 27:52.424
Thanks ever so much.

27:55.898 --> 27:57.578
Ah, wonderful.

27:57.834 --> 27:59.084
Thank you.

28:04.005 --> 28:05.006
Wenst U een bier?

28:07.196 --> 28:09.116
Thanks. I'd kill for one.

28:14.631 --> 28:16.311
I saw you at the track this morning.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.413
Were you there when Alex Martin fell?

28:21.507 --> 28:22.307
Not sure.

28:23.067 --> 28:25.466
Mr Noonan likes to keep me busy.

28:26.048 --> 28:27.528
I see.

28:28.703 --> 28:30.302
How long have you worked for him?

28:30.821 --> 28:31.606
A while.

28:32.335 --> 28:33.789
Doing what, exactly?

28:35.447 --> 28:37.047
This. And that.

28:40.884 --> 28:43.298
I see you've got some bark
missing you hurt yourself?

28:43.686 --> 28:46.543
Nothing serious. Part of the job.

28:47.289 --> 28:48.262
Sounds dangerous.

28:48.288 --> 28:49.808
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:52.029 --> 28:54.483
I don't imagine jockeys would
put up much of a fight,

28:54.484 --> 28:56.004
given the size difference.

29:01.043 --> 29:04.483
Alex owed the boss some money.
I give him a reminder.

29:05.171 --> 29:06.691
When?

29:07.121 --> 29:08.760
After the race.

29:09.551 --> 29:11.631
He was a tough little bastard.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.226
Well...

29:22.801 --> 29:24.520
Interesting chap, Terry Noonan.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.474
His sizeable Dutch friend in there

29:27.500 --> 29:29.444
just happens to have bruised knuckles.

29:32.217 --> 29:34.539
Yes, he admitted
punching Alex yesterday

29:35.006 --> 29:36.783
to remind him about his debts.

29:37.004 --> 29:40.083
By the way, Terry tell you anything
else once I'd left the room?

29:40.176 --> 29:41.843
No, nothing of any consequence.

29:42.316 --> 29:43.844
How much are you in for, Frank?

29:45.912 --> 29:47.591
Well, I did have one win yesterday.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.760
How much do you owe him?

29:51.179 --> 29:52.225
A lot.

29:53.032 --> 29:55.591
Frank, the man's an SP bookie
with a thug the size of...

29:55.624 --> 29:57.943
Yes, thank you, Blake,
I'm well aware of that.

29:58.014 --> 29:59.397
Then what are you doing?

29:59.845 --> 30:01.685
A man's gotta have a vice or two.

30:01.719 --> 30:03.679
Especially since the wife died.

30:05.724 --> 30:07.404
That why you wanted me
along this morning?

30:07.436 --> 30:08.406
To keep you honest?

30:09.853 --> 30:11.337
A man like Noonan...

30:12.436 --> 30:14.138
...the money you owe him's
the least of your problems.

30:14.164 --> 30:16.043
Yes, thank you, Blake, for the lecture,

30:16.044 --> 30:17.844
but we do have another stop to make.

30:20.072 --> 30:22.752
Apparently, Alex Martin lived
here the last couple of years.

30:24.965 --> 30:27.644
Right. So what are we looking at?

30:27.724 --> 30:29.457
Nothing. That's the point.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.645
He's packed everything up.

30:36.282 --> 30:37.922
But he's left this.

30:44.734 --> 30:46.534
Aunty Agnes Clasby.

30:47.849 --> 30:51.409
He knew his days were numbered
and he packed up his life.

30:51.435 --> 30:54.354
Didn't you say the rupture in
his liver wasn't fatal, though?

30:54.606 --> 30:55.897
Still, he knew.

30:55.923 --> 30:58.403
I've looked through it,
it's all personal stuff.

31:01.488 --> 31:02.691
Ballarat Cup.

31:02.717 --> 31:04.917
And... I found this.

31:13.613 --> 31:15.373
That's your handwriting, Terry.
Correct?

31:18.056 --> 31:20.696
It was found amongst the
possessions of Alexander Martin.

31:21.897 --> 31:25.816
It appears he's laid a £20 bet
on the nose of another horse

31:26.434 --> 31:28.298
in a race that he
himself was riding in.

31:29.109 --> 31:30.364
The Ballarat Cup.

31:31.912 --> 31:36.111
So Alex, riding the favourite,
bets against himself.

31:37.236 --> 31:37.958
With you.

31:41.071 --> 31:43.432
It's a pretty healthy pay
day, I would have thought,

31:43.458 --> 31:46.084
when you're guaranteed the
favourite's not gonna come in.

31:47.916 --> 31:50.408
I put it to you, Terry, that
you offered Alex inducements

31:50.442 --> 31:51.526
to throw that race.

31:52.451 --> 31:54.483
But when he ultimately refused,

31:54.484 --> 31:56.204
you sent a man in your employ,

31:56.230 --> 31:58.288
Diederik Bronkhorst,
around to assault him.

32:03.685 --> 32:07.178
Alright. Terrence Noonan, I'm
placing you under arrest

32:07.219 --> 32:09.646
on suspicion for engaging
and facilitating

32:09.850 --> 32:12.055
in conduct corrupting
a betting outcome.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.972
I'd also like to state for the record

32:21.641 --> 32:24.586
my personal debt with Mr Noonan

32:24.612 --> 32:27.772
which currently stands at £325.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.949
And which will remain
regardless of these charges.

32:31.473 --> 32:33.001
That's right, Terrence,

32:33.473 --> 32:35.388
I'll pay you back in full, as promised.

32:35.874 --> 32:38.443
And if I find out you've
killed Alex Martin,

32:38.592 --> 32:40.512
I'll also take you down for murder.

32:42.607 --> 32:44.247
Fair enough?

33:04.741 --> 33:06.221
What?

33:11.198 --> 33:12.538
Can I lend you some money?

33:13.464 --> 33:15.065
Of course you're a major flight risk,

33:15.091 --> 33:17.838
I'd need some sort of guarantee
you won't up and leave Ballarat,

33:17.864 --> 33:19.704
but seriously, if it might help...

33:21.282 --> 33:23.081
That won't be necessary.

33:24.479 --> 33:25.644
But thank you.

33:27.193 --> 33:28.752
Of course.

33:29.004 --> 33:30.763
So...

33:30.911 --> 33:33.018
...how long do you plan
on keeping Noonan?

33:33.799 --> 33:35.682
Oh, I'll let him stew
for a couple of hours

33:35.708 --> 33:37.058
then I'll let him go.

33:38.176 --> 33:39.475
Boss?

33:39.884 --> 33:41.422
That was the hospital.

33:41.448 --> 33:42.983
That jockey you were chasing?

33:43.009 --> 33:44.608
Shane Heywood. Yes, how is he?

33:44.877 --> 33:47.677
Yeah... He died 10 minutes ago,

33:47.703 --> 33:49.578
from injuries sustained.

33:50.156 --> 33:51.347
Right.

33:51.542 --> 33:52.643
Head out to the track

33:52.644 --> 33:54.870
and question the two riders
involved in his accident.

33:54.896 --> 33:56.015
Yes, sir.

33:56.861 --> 33:58.683
Charlie, I think I'll come with you.

33:58.790 --> 34:00.364
Ah, no, you won't.

34:01.448 --> 34:03.128
Have you gone home at all today, Doc?

34:04.523 --> 34:07.268
Charlie, I was wanting to
catch up with you and...

34:07.456 --> 34:10.924
Boss had me on court duty all day,
but I stopped home for lunch and...

34:12.274 --> 34:14.513
Well... how is she?

34:15.404 --> 34:17.484
Is Mrs Beazley alright?

34:18.956 --> 34:21.275
Mrs Beazley and I...

34:23.268 --> 34:27.228
Quite frankly, Charlie, we don't
know what the hell's going on.

34:28.293 --> 34:29.523
Yeah, still...

34:30.080 --> 34:31.404
...you should be there.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.764
Tell her I'll be home for dinner.

34:58.844 --> 35:01.618
Ah! We were wondering...
Where's Charlie?

35:02.889 --> 35:04.123
Charlie. Um...

35:04.945 --> 35:07.924
Charlie's conducting a search.
He'll be here later.

35:09.604 --> 35:11.007
Alice.

35:12.639 --> 35:13.941
You said to come over.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.227
Yes. Yes, I did.

35:16.434 --> 35:18.393
Jean's been advising me about cooking.

35:18.675 --> 35:21.394
She suggested I hire someone
rather than try to learn.

35:21.597 --> 35:23.643
She's a working woman she
doesn't have time to cook.

35:24.186 --> 35:25.763
Of course.

35:26.489 --> 35:28.449
Who's for another drink?

35:40.444 --> 35:42.163
Couldn't you have come home earlier?

35:43.278 --> 35:44.883
I am so sorry.

35:45.468 --> 35:47.243
You had no warning?

35:47.978 --> 35:50.164
I was told she was dead, you know that.

35:52.211 --> 35:54.025
Where did she come from?
How did she get here?

35:56.485 --> 35:58.724
Apparently, she escaped from China.

35:59.382 --> 36:02.443
She spent a year in a
refugee camp in Hong Kong.

36:02.709 --> 36:05.789
- I can't imagine.
- Oh, none of us can.

36:08.139 --> 36:09.859
So many years have passed, Jean, I...

36:13.644 --> 36:15.204
What do we do?

36:16.868 --> 36:18.105
Lucien?

36:22.491 --> 36:24.171
It's obvious, isn't it?

37:04.928 --> 37:08.447
Interestingly, there was a sizeable
haematoma across the chest

37:08.473 --> 37:10.032
we couldn't understand it.

37:10.212 --> 37:13.171
Previous injuries meant
that the fall was fatal.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.316
He should never have
got back on a horse.

37:15.458 --> 37:16.715
Sorry I'm late.

37:17.358 --> 37:18.958
Dr Harvey.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.413
Ah, Mrs Blake, I'm Charlie Davis.

37:23.836 --> 37:25.876
Charlie lives with us.

37:27.650 --> 37:29.363
Pleased to meet you, Charlie.

37:29.697 --> 37:31.018
Your plate's on the stove.

37:31.528 --> 37:33.208
Wonderful.

37:35.743 --> 37:38.502
The surprise to us was
there were no lacerations.

37:38.968 --> 37:42.383
The cable was an elegant
conclusion, given the variables.

37:43.251 --> 37:44.851
Quite.

37:45.367 --> 37:46.957
You say this man was murdered?

37:47.045 --> 37:47.574
Yes.

37:49.451 --> 37:51.490
Was he a gambler himself?

37:52.213 --> 37:54.138
That's a very good question, Mrs Blake.

37:55.246 --> 37:58.189
Probably sounds odd, but we sometimes
discuss the doctor's work.

37:58.215 --> 37:59.895
He says that it helps.

38:07.068 --> 38:09.547
Why did he pack up his house then?

38:09.919 --> 38:12.043
He was saying goodbye, he
knew what was happening.

38:12.817 --> 38:14.876
Ooh, not that it's any of my business.

38:14.939 --> 38:16.938
- I didn't mean...
- Was he simply very clean?

38:17.354 --> 38:19.911
- No man's that clean.
- Oh, that's a bit harsh.

38:25.415 --> 38:29.300
Apparently this new TAB thing has
scared a lot of the bookies.

38:30.144 --> 38:31.149
Where did you hear this?

38:31.175 --> 38:33.940
That registrar. Horses and
golf, horses and golf.

38:33.966 --> 38:35.855
It was all he talked about.

38:37.763 --> 38:41.543
Totalisator Board. Um, TAB.
It's... It's a...

38:42.097 --> 38:43.163
...a government-run betting agency.

38:43.164 --> 38:45.094
It's very, very new.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.281
Government?

38:46.307 --> 38:48.504
They think it's a useful
way to raise revenue.

38:48.530 --> 38:50.810
I wouldn't trust the
government to do anything.

38:56.231 --> 38:59.630
The doc said you were
living in China, Mrs Blake.

39:00.506 --> 39:04.643
Yes, I was... put to work
in Shenzhen, after the war.

39:05.221 --> 39:06.981
Why was that?

39:07.864 --> 39:10.584
They called me a foreign hostile.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.080
But then the food ran out.

39:16.368 --> 39:17.968
Dreadful famine there, Charlie.

39:20.864 --> 39:22.823
Everything fell apart.

39:22.977 --> 39:24.683
We were starving.

39:25.075 --> 39:26.675
People...

39:27.719 --> 39:29.679
...did things.

39:32.786 --> 39:37.098
Eventually, I had to make a
choice to stay and die or to run.

39:37.716 --> 39:39.043
I made it to Wan Chai

39:39.044 --> 39:43.604
and after some time, I managed
to get word to the consulate.

39:46.357 --> 39:49.764
- That sounds awful.
- There wasn't much time for gambling.

39:55.428 --> 39:57.164
Excuse me, please.

39:59.765 --> 40:03.523
And thank you, Mrs Beazley.
That was delicious.

40:03.524 --> 40:05.164
Oh, please, leave it to me.

40:17.464 --> 40:20.119
Thank you, Lucien.

40:20.583 --> 40:22.443
It was an interesting night.

40:22.849 --> 40:23.930
Yes.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.204
This must be very hard for you.

40:32.181 --> 40:33.781
Goodnight, Alice.

41:24.930 --> 41:29.314
Now, Agnes, we found
this in Alex's house.

41:29.340 --> 41:32.281
The police agreed I
should give it to you.

41:41.270 --> 41:44.709
Look at him, standing in the saddle.

41:45.155 --> 41:47.475
He knew he'd raced well.

41:49.490 --> 41:50.763
I blame myself.

41:50.764 --> 41:54.964
- Oh, don't be so silly, Agnes.
- Don't patronise me, Lucien.

41:56.694 --> 41:58.407
I used to pay him sixpence

41:58.433 --> 42:00.684
to take my tips down to
the local fruiterer.

42:02.394 --> 42:05.193
The man ran bets out of
his shop on the weekend.

42:05.484 --> 42:07.531
That's where he must have started.

42:07.946 --> 42:10.003
I see, so he gambled a lot.

42:10.401 --> 42:13.121
He lost a marriage because of it.

42:14.581 --> 42:16.501
And then he lost his love of racing.

42:26.412 --> 42:28.052
I made this for him.

42:28.618 --> 42:30.057
When he was little.

42:30.889 --> 42:33.832
I rather suspect he found
his love for racing again.

42:34.447 --> 42:36.203
- I warned you, Lucien.
- No, no, no...

42:36.204 --> 42:38.243
Why else would he leave this for you?

42:38.670 --> 42:40.263
And do you know, Ada McCrae said,

42:40.289 --> 42:42.315
he couldn't stand being
out of the saddle.

42:43.347 --> 42:46.564
He came back to racing, even
though he knew it could kill him.

42:52.031 --> 42:55.631
Be a dear and... carry this
to the car for me, will you?

42:59.035 --> 43:00.813
Just out of interest,
Mrs McCrae, how...

43:00.928 --> 43:03.127
...how tall was Blue Monday?

43:03.818 --> 43:05.763
15.2 hands.

43:06.095 --> 43:08.644
Right. About 5.2 at the withers.

43:10.350 --> 43:11.241
Yes.

43:11.267 --> 43:12.986
I've been brushing up on my horses.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.684
The, um... The Chief
Superintendent, he's, um...

43:17.844 --> 43:20.243
...how shall I say?
Somewhat of a fan of yours.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.323
He's been lovely.

43:22.916 --> 43:25.163
Called me last night to
make sure I was alright.

43:25.769 --> 43:26.940
Really?

43:28.320 --> 43:29.919
Well, yeah.

43:30.124 --> 43:32.472
So, do you think Terry
and Shane are involved?

43:33.722 --> 43:35.434
Did the Superintendent say something?

43:35.707 --> 43:39.564
No, but Terry's been questioned
and Shane tried to run away.

43:40.924 --> 43:44.643
Yes. You're very good with the horses.

43:45.239 --> 43:47.337
As long as they know you're in charge.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.204
You can't let them have their own way.

43:50.821 --> 43:52.341
And what would happen then?

43:52.764 --> 43:56.444
They'd destroy themselves,
and take you down with them.

43:57.858 --> 44:03.540
Oh. Excuse me, Doctor, but
this girl is driving me mad.

44:10.099 --> 44:12.939
Why is no-one ever happy to see me?

44:14.259 --> 44:17.299
My first front page for the
Courier, a horse race!

44:19.467 --> 44:22.019
- That's a very good photograph.
- Tell that to my boss.

44:22.261 --> 44:25.638
Perhaps he'll do more than let me
write court reports and horoscopes.

44:27.282 --> 44:30.068
So in the meantime you'll just
loiter around racetracks?

44:30.094 --> 44:31.684
Amongst other places.

44:33.001 --> 44:36.320
Did you happen to take
any other photographs,

44:37.756 --> 44:39.324
after the race, perhaps?

44:40.637 --> 44:42.796
I'm not falling for it.

44:43.478 --> 44:45.603
That very charming thing that you do.

44:45.733 --> 44:48.243
Ask lots of questions,
listen carefully,

44:48.244 --> 44:49.883
nod understandingly.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.523
People talk to you but
you tell them nothing.

44:53.138 --> 44:54.234
Doesn't work with me.

44:55.196 --> 44:56.623
Why are you here?

44:56.733 --> 44:58.492
A man fell from a horse and died.

44:58.924 --> 45:01.263
Which last happened here five
years ago when Kev Dawson died,

45:01.289 --> 45:03.209
that doesn't explain why you're here.

45:07.261 --> 45:10.940
Alex Martin was murdered the
morning after the Ballarat Cup.

45:11.735 --> 45:12.763
You?

45:13.358 --> 45:16.342
Every other racetrack in Victoria
is busily kicking up a stink

45:16.368 --> 45:17.923
about the TAB coming in.

45:18.027 --> 45:19.371
But not here.

45:19.644 --> 45:23.163
Someone has a very tight grip
on things and no-one's talking.

45:23.414 --> 45:24.844
Who?

45:25.876 --> 45:31.355
Oh... Alex owed money to an SP bookie
chap by the name of Terrence Noonan.

45:32.089 --> 45:35.224
Mr Noonan's hired thug
had a go at Alex.

45:35.250 --> 45:36.769
Big bloke. Dutch.

45:36.878 --> 45:38.677
I saw him hassling
Martin after the race.

45:38.764 --> 45:40.417
And then the rider
that came in second...

45:40.443 --> 45:43.602
Shane Heywood, tried to evade
police, ran out onto the track,

45:44.503 --> 45:48.763
was trampled and sadly... died
in hospital from his injuries.

45:49.513 --> 45:51.791
I don't have anything on Mr Tennant...

45:51.817 --> 45:52.563
The track manager.

45:52.564 --> 45:54.043
Served out a year's suspension

45:54.044 --> 45:55.883
handed out by the Victorian Racing Club

45:55.884 --> 45:58.604
for being involved in a
substitution scam in Camperdown.

46:00.427 --> 46:02.027
Bloody hell.

46:02.592 --> 46:07.271
It seems every one of them could
be involved in one way or another,

46:07.389 --> 46:09.028
wouldn't you think?

46:10.022 --> 46:12.164
We should exchange
information again some time.

46:18.378 --> 46:22.114
- Alex was in debt to Mr Noonan.
- So he bets against himself.

46:23.232 --> 46:25.471
Noonan agrees to cancel the debt. Mmm.

46:26.724 --> 46:28.764
That's not Terry Noonan's style.

46:29.437 --> 46:31.437
Perhaps he thought he had no option.

46:33.135 --> 46:35.958
What do you reckon, Hopalong?
Go on, show him.

46:41.911 --> 46:43.844
Goodness me.

46:44.707 --> 46:45.997
I tell you what, Bill, I think

46:46.023 --> 46:47.493
Miss Anderson has
captured you perfectly.

46:47.519 --> 46:50.655
Yeah, well, that's one opinion, Frank.

46:50.953 --> 46:52.198
Now look, there's also the question

46:52.224 --> 46:55.034
of how much Ada McCrae and Mr Tennant

46:55.060 --> 46:56.842
knew about the whole thing.

46:57.397 --> 46:58.378
Hi, Ballarat Police.

46:58.404 --> 47:00.745
I understand you've
been speaking with her.

47:00.771 --> 47:02.370
I thought she could be of assistance.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.643
Frank?

47:04.644 --> 47:08.182
Sorry for calling, Superintendent,
but I didn't know what else to do.

47:08.208 --> 47:11.364
Don't kid yourself, Ada, that girl's
been trouble for a long time now.

47:12.777 --> 47:14.318
Over there.

47:15.506 --> 47:16.830
Excuse me.

47:27.331 --> 47:29.510
Hobart already searched
this entire place.

47:37.647 --> 47:39.018
Where's Miss Dawson now?

47:39.226 --> 47:41.832
Oh, well, she saw me in
here and she ran off.

47:41.858 --> 47:44.719
- And what about the cable?
- That can wait.

47:50.021 --> 47:51.981
Numerous vantage points.

47:53.375 --> 47:54.974
Yes, lots of cover, just not for us.

47:55.242 --> 47:56.922
- I'm gonna check the back gate.
- Alright.

48:01.404 --> 48:04.963
Do you think she's coming for us?!
Well, we gotta get out of here!

48:04.964 --> 48:07.963
No, no, no! We're safe in here,
she won't fire into the stable

48:07.964 --> 48:09.206
when there's a risk to the animals.

48:09.232 --> 48:10.791
Come on! Come on!

48:12.864 --> 48:14.466
Jesus!

48:22.634 --> 48:24.233
Mr Tennant, let me see that.

48:24.918 --> 48:28.363
Right, I want you to place your hand
here, press firmly against the wound.

48:28.389 --> 48:30.923
Mrs McCrae, how much ammunition
was kept with that rifle?

48:30.924 --> 48:32.323
Quite a few rounds.

48:32.324 --> 48:34.124
She's obviously comfortable
with firearms.

48:35.706 --> 48:37.386
Now, stay here.

48:39.646 --> 48:41.286
Robyn, it's me.

48:43.662 --> 48:45.622
Robyn, I'm coming out. Alright?

48:47.586 --> 48:49.186
Just me, I'm unarmed.

48:50.331 --> 48:51.811
You can come out too.

48:54.328 --> 48:56.035
I promise it'll be alright.

49:00.286 --> 49:01.706
Come on.

49:05.303 --> 49:06.464
That's it.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.615
Robyn, would you lower the
rifle for me, please.

49:17.166 --> 49:18.806
Thank you.

49:19.556 --> 49:25.315
Now, did you tell anyone that someone
strung a cable across the track?

49:25.765 --> 49:27.338
Yeah, I told Miss McCrae.

49:28.019 --> 49:29.618
Right.

49:29.995 --> 49:31.123
So...

49:31.534 --> 49:34.001
Alex Martin comes back to
ride in the Ballarat Cup.

49:34.509 --> 49:36.163
He's the sentimental favourite.

49:36.403 --> 49:38.614
But he's supposed to throw the race.
Mr Noonan?

49:38.640 --> 49:40.650
Alex put 20 quid on Shane Heywood.

49:40.676 --> 49:44.685
I'm guessing Mrs McCrae
placed a sizable bet too.

49:44.711 --> 49:48.390
£150 at long odds. She
would have made a killing.

49:48.806 --> 49:49.976
Right.

49:50.960 --> 49:53.884
You didn't count on how
much Alex loved to race.

49:55.404 --> 49:57.683
Especially when he thought
he'd never ride again.

49:57.684 --> 49:59.203
What was it you said?

49:59.920 --> 50:01.404
'Let them have their own way...

50:02.724 --> 50:06.563
...and they'll destroy themselves,
and take you down too.'

50:07.217 --> 50:10.098
You couldn't let anyone see
that you'd lost control.

50:10.124 --> 50:11.235
You had to send a message.

50:11.261 --> 50:13.986
You have... no idea

50:14.012 --> 50:15.871
what you're talking about, Doctor.

50:15.897 --> 50:18.575
You don't know anything
about this world.

50:19.232 --> 50:22.272
No, I don't. But you do.

50:23.237 --> 50:26.436
You knew exactly how
high to string that wire

50:26.844 --> 50:28.883
so it caught the jockey, not the horse.

50:29.208 --> 50:33.029
You knew once Alex was in the clear
he'd stand up in that saddle.

50:33.954 --> 50:38.083
You never thought for a moment the
horse would fall with its rider.

50:38.376 --> 50:39.764
And now they're both dead.

50:41.234 --> 50:45.403
And that... that's why you
were crying when we met you.

50:46.332 --> 50:49.257
You were crying for the horse you
killed, not for Alex Martin.

50:49.283 --> 50:50.763
Shane Heywood...

50:50.764 --> 50:53.883
Oh, he did exactly what you
wanted him to do, he chased Alex,

50:53.884 --> 50:56.844
helped you take the cable down
before anyone else got there.

50:59.153 --> 51:01.672
It was my horse. My track.

51:02.322 --> 51:03.682
My game.

51:11.843 --> 51:13.643
You killed that horse.

51:23.884 --> 51:25.258
You right? Yeah.

51:25.284 --> 51:27.443
Don't think this gets you
out of that debt of yours.

51:27.775 --> 51:30.618
Ada McCrae, I'm placing
you under arrest

51:30.644 --> 51:32.364
for the murder of Alex Martin.

51:33.496 --> 51:36.296
Miss Dawson, you'll be facing
charges of reckless endangerment.

51:37.718 --> 51:40.872
Miss Anderson! This should
get you a front page.

51:46.679 --> 51:48.679
It's alright, Robyn. It's alright.

52:35.724 --> 52:38.204
You never used to drink alone.

52:41.585 --> 52:43.157
No.

52:45.632 --> 52:47.392
No, I didn't.

52:54.696 --> 52:56.496
Where are you going?

52:58.558 --> 53:00.878
You've always been kind to me.

53:03.142 --> 53:05.731
But this has been such an intrusion.

53:05.757 --> 53:07.877
- Mai Lin...
- Please let me finish.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.864
I didn't expect this.

53:18.940 --> 53:20.387
But I understand.

53:20.413 --> 53:22.505
It has been 17 years.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.999
I found a hotel in town.

53:28.077 --> 53:30.037
The Soldier's Hill, do you know it?

53:31.664 --> 53:32.760
Yes.

53:33.147 --> 53:35.030
They have a room for me.

53:37.285 --> 53:40.414
Thank Jean for her hospitality, please.

53:40.870 --> 53:42.670
Mai Lin...

53:47.365 --> 53:49.085
You are my wife.

53:51.323 --> 53:53.243
Yes, I am.

53:57.501 --> 54:01.421
Would you drive me, please?
My suitcase is heavy.

54:04.892 --> 54:06.372
Of course.
