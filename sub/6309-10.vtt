electromagnetic energy,

Prospero has infused the atmosphere

they have a video buffer.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.941
They retain a certain amount
of data before broadcasting it.

01:39.942 --> 01:42.445

Future me knew that past me
was going to John Dee's estate,

because that would violate

05:21.545 --> 05:22.931

was going into the past.

- A lot.

05:29.038 --> 05:32.407
Ah! Here we go. This is the one.

We do have a little wiggle room, however...
[Keys jingle]

05:34.677 --> 05:37.579

So there's a lot of
uncertainty in the story.

So if we borrow the staff,
bring it back to the present,

05:49.291 --> 05:50.325
use it to defeat Prospero,

05:50.326 --> 05:52.393
