Abracadabra, abracacat!

00:37.640 --> 00:40.640
Watch me pull a rabbit
right out of this hat!

00:40.919 --> 00:44.040
One, two, three...

00:44.239 --> 00:46.640
and... Ta-dah!

00:50.280 --> 00:52.080
Nothing! I don't get it!

00:52.239 --> 00:55.400
I've been waving my wand
over this hat for three hours--

00:56.000 --> 00:59.040
-And 12 minutes.
-And not a rabbit has come out!

00:59.239 --> 01:01.839
Hmm. Maybe it's the wand.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.720
-Maybe it's broken.
-Yes! Of course!

01:04.920 --> 01:08.720
That must be it!
Something's wrong with the wand.

01:08.920 --> 01:10.479
Right, Ollie?

01:10.679 --> 01:13.000
Well, I dunno, Moon.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.240
You know, um...

01:15.440 --> 01:17.399
I'm not so sure
I believe in magic.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.720
-What?
-I just find it hard to believe

01:19.920 --> 01:22.720
that waving a stick can make
amazing things happen.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.640
But it can!
How can I prove it to you?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.839
-How can I prove it to him?
-You could get a new wand.

01:28.039 --> 01:29.759
One you can be sure will work.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.479
That's a great brainstorm,
Stanley! Where?

01:33.800 --> 01:36.320
How about at Merlin's cave?

01:36.520 --> 01:38.199
Is that a store in town?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.880
No. It's an actual cave
where Merlin,

01:41.080 --> 01:43.880
this famous wizard guy
from legend, used to hang out.

01:44.039 --> 01:45.360
-Nice beard.
-Nice hat.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.520
He's one of the most famous
magicians ever.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.520
A wand from that cave
would work for sure.

01:50.679 --> 01:53.960
That's a great brainstorm,
Stanley. So it's settled!

01:54.160 --> 01:56.119
I am taking you to...

01:56.320 --> 01:59.280
-Er, where's the cave?
-England.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.720
To England!

02:06.479 --> 02:07.679
Whoo!

02:09.079 --> 02:10.280
Whee!

02:17.400 --> 02:20.480
<i>Now arriving in England!</i>

02:20.680 --> 02:21.959
<i>Yay!</i>

02:27.840 --> 02:30.519
Merlin's cave
is right by Tintagel Castle.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.440
So keep a lookout.
It should be easy to spot,

02:33.600 --> 02:36.320
'cause it's probably
a great big fancy castle

02:36.480 --> 02:38.720
with magic sparkles
all around it!

02:38.920 --> 02:42.440
Or could it be a big stone ruin
with mangy moss all around it?

02:42.880 --> 02:45.920
[gasps]
I bet it's magical mangy moss!

02:46.079 --> 02:49.560
Because this place
is definitely magic!

02:49.760 --> 02:50.959
Whoa!

02:53.560 --> 02:57.239
Magic, you say?
If it's magic you're looking for,

02:57.440 --> 02:59.480
you've come to the right place!

02:59.679 --> 03:03.160
Hi. We're Ollie and Moon.
Who are you?

03:03.320 --> 03:06.359
I am Mighty Mysterious Martin,

03:06.720 --> 03:10.239
the greatest magician
in all of England!

03:10.440 --> 03:12.239
Nice to meet you!

03:12.440 --> 03:15.600
Allow me to amaze you!

03:15.799 --> 03:21.760
Watch me make a coin appear
behind your ear!

03:21.959 --> 03:24.760
Like the one that just
fell out of your sleeve?

03:24.959 --> 03:27.200
Er... What I meant to say was...

03:27.359 --> 03:31.239
Watch me make a dove
fly out of my hat!

03:33.280 --> 03:36.200
Brian! You were supposed
to stay in the hat

03:36.399 --> 03:38.640
till I said the magic words!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.920
Oh, I'm hopeless.

03:43.119 --> 03:46.000
-No, you're not!
-It was a very good try!

03:46.280 --> 03:48.720
No. I get too nervous.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.359
I always mess up!

03:50.519 --> 03:53.119
I'm giving up magic forever.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.359
No, Martin, you can't!

03:57.560 --> 04:00.799
Your wand is probably
just broken, like mine!

04:00.959 --> 04:03.079
Really? You think so?

04:03.280 --> 04:05.399
-Well...
-I'm sure of it.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.119
Come with us and get a new one

04:07.320 --> 04:09.720
in the most magical place
on Earth!

04:10.040 --> 04:11.480
Look! This way!

04:14.519 --> 04:16.560
Once I get my magic wand...

04:16.760 --> 04:19.399
Ooh, the things
I'll pull out of my hat!

04:19.599 --> 04:20.880
Like carrots!

04:21.079 --> 04:22.680
Think bigger, Martin!

04:22.880 --> 04:27.400
[gasps] Carrot juice!
Ooh! A carrot fountain!

04:27.880 --> 04:29.200
Oh!

04:29.400 --> 04:31.200
How about a 12-foot carrot pizza
in carrot sauce,

04:31.400 --> 04:32.960
-with extra carrots?
-Oh!

04:33.159 --> 04:35.240
[excited laugh]

04:35.440 --> 04:38.360
That's it, Ollie!
Sounds like you're getting excited

04:38.560 --> 04:41.240
-about the magic wand now.
-Moon,

04:41.479 --> 04:43.599
I don't believe you'll find
a magic wand here.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.520
But if you do and you pull
a 12-foot carrot pizza

04:47.400 --> 04:49.800
out of your hat,
I promise you I will eat it.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.880
Ah! Wow! Look at that! Wands!

04:57.919 --> 05:00.960
I think those are just sticks,
not wands.

05:01.159 --> 05:04.320
Then why is the light shining
right on 'em all magic-like?

05:04.520 --> 05:06.680
Because we were meant
to find these!

05:08.800 --> 05:11.599
Oh! What a magical moment!

05:11.800 --> 05:13.360
Let's try them out!

05:13.560 --> 05:16.280
I feel so magical and powerful.

05:16.479 --> 05:19.360
Let's do something really cool.
I know!

05:19.560 --> 05:22.080
Let's make that stream
over there come to us!

05:22.560 --> 05:27.400
Abracadabra, abracadus,
make that water come to us!

05:32.039 --> 05:34.520
-Water...
-Whoa!

05:34.719 --> 05:37.359
These wands are awesome!

05:37.560 --> 05:38.719
Did you see that, Ollie?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.479
I don't think that was magic,
Moon.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.200
Of course it was! You saw it!

05:48.039 --> 05:50.560
No, I'm pretty sure it was the tide.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.919
-The who?
-The tide.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.039
The ocean
flows up onto the beach

05:54.200 --> 05:56.159
at certain times of the day
all on its own.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.479
-He doesn't believe.
-So sad.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.760
But I know
how to convince you, Ollie!

06:01.919 --> 06:03.760
Here! Try it yourself.

06:03.919 --> 06:06.599
-Me?
-Yes! Then you'll see.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.919
Well... OK, I guess.
But I need to try a trick

06:10.120 --> 06:14.120
that could never happen
any way except by magic.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.919
OK. Here goes nothing.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.680
-Abracada...
-Wait, Ollie.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.240
We have to close our eyes
and really, really concentrate!

06:26.440 --> 06:30.440
OK. Abracadabra, abracadog,

06:30.560 --> 06:33.560
turn this rabbit into a frog!

06:35.120 --> 06:36.760
What?

06:39.640 --> 06:43.479
-Oh, well. Didn't work.
-But, Ollie, Martin's gone!

06:43.680 --> 06:44.479
-And look!
-Ah!

06:46.680 --> 06:48.440
It worked!
It really, really worked!

06:48.760 --> 06:51.159
M-m-m-magic?

06:51.359 --> 06:52.760
I did real magic!

06:52.960 --> 06:57.760
Yes! You turned Martin
into a frog with my magic wand!

06:58.039 --> 07:01.080
Moon, you were right!
This is amazing!

07:01.280 --> 07:03.440
Guess I'd better
change him back, though!

07:05.000 --> 07:06.120
Oh!

07:06.280 --> 07:09.599
-Oh, no! Martin!
-Come back!

07:09.799 --> 07:11.880
Abracada... Abra...

07:12.039 --> 07:14.840
Hey! Quit moving around! Wait!

07:15.000 --> 07:15.919
[panting]

07:16.799 --> 07:18.719
Whoa! Water!

07:21.239 --> 07:23.280
-Where'd he go?
-[croaks]

07:25.200 --> 07:26.479
That way!

07:30.760 --> 07:34.719
-Now where is he?
-Uh, Moon?

07:34.880 --> 07:37.520
Abracadabra, abracadabbit,

07:37.680 --> 07:40.440
turn this frog
back into a rabbit!

07:42.400 --> 07:45.120
Abracadabra, this isn't funny,

07:45.280 --> 07:49.200
turn this frog
back into a bunny!

07:49.400 --> 07:54.520
Abracadabra, abracada-dare,
turn this frog back into a hare!

07:54.719 --> 07:57.280
-Why exactly are we doing this?
-Oh, hi, Martin.

07:57.479 --> 07:59.760
What happened was,
Ollie here turned you into a frog,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.359
and now we need to turn you
back into a rabbit,

08:02.640 --> 08:06.039
but the wand's not working and,
you know, it's just...

08:06.280 --> 08:09.320
BOTH: Martin? You're not a frog?

08:09.520 --> 08:12.479
Well, no. Sorry I messed up
the magic trick.

08:12.679 --> 08:14.520
But a seagull stole my wand,

08:14.719 --> 08:17.320
and I had to chase after him
to get it back!

08:18.599 --> 08:21.479
Oops! Better grab my hat, too!

08:21.679 --> 08:23.640
So, Martin was never a frog?

08:23.799 --> 08:26.280
-The wand never worked?
-I guess not.

08:26.479 --> 08:28.520
And the water was just the tide?

08:28.719 --> 08:31.320
-And my wand...
-Is just a stick.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.959
I'm sorry, Moon. I think I'm
just as disappointed as you are.

08:36.679 --> 08:40.600
OK! Now that I've got
my new magic wand back...

08:40.799 --> 08:46.160
I, Mighty Mysterious Martin,
am ready to amaze you!

08:46.560 --> 08:51.040
Watch as I perform the most
spectacular feats of magic

08:51.240 --> 08:54.400
seen in these parts
since Merlin himself!

08:54.560 --> 08:56.400
[excited murmurings]

08:56.959 --> 09:00.120
I can't tell him. It's too sad.
You tell him.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.800
[clears throat] Right.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.920
So, Martin, there's something
I have to tell you.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.920
Hold on!

09:07.120 --> 09:12.199
First, just let me get that coin
out from behind your ear.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.199
-Did you see that?
-Whoa!

09:14.400 --> 09:15.480
Oh, nicely done.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.040
But what I need
to tell you is...

09:17.199 --> 09:21.360
Hold on! I think
there's something in my hat.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.680
-I don't see anything.
-Really?

09:23.880 --> 09:27.520
Try looking harder!

09:27.720 --> 09:30.600
-Incredible!
-Wow! That was really good!

09:30.760 --> 09:33.560
-Still, you should know...
-Keep looking!

09:35.319 --> 09:37.680
-Whoa!
-Well done!

09:37.880 --> 09:39.720
-Ollie, what's happening?
-I don't know.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.720
I keep trying to tell Martin
that his wand's not magic,

09:42.920 --> 09:45.360
but he won't stop doing
this amazing magic!

09:45.560 --> 09:48.800
[gasps] Wait! Remember
what Martin said before,

09:48.959 --> 09:50.800
a-bout being nervous?
-Moon,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.720
do you think that wand
is giving him confidence?

09:54.040 --> 09:56.560
Yeah! I think
it's helping him do the things

09:56.720 --> 09:58.720
he was too nervous
to do before!

09:58.920 --> 10:02.560
Then, in a way, Moon,
the wand <i>is </i>magic, isn't it?

10:02.760 --> 10:05.560
Yeah!
Told ya I'd prove it to you.

pulling stuff out of my hat

10:40.280 --> 10:42.240
and I have something
to show you!

10:42.439 --> 10:43.720
You really need to get in here!

10:43.920 --> 10:44.959
What is it? [gasps]

10:46.800 --> 10:50.400
Whoa! Moon,
I don't know how you did it, but...

10:50.880 --> 10:53.959
Watch closely as I,
the Amazing Ollie,

10:54.160 --> 10:57.199
make this carrot pizza...
disappear! [chomps]
