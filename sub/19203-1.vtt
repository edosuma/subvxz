00:29.780 --> 00:32.469
It really starts to make sinks, dispatch you to install!

00:32.470 --> 00:35.340
Embark all the vivres on the boat.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.350
Good blood! It beautiful until now, what made occurs?

00:39.710 --> 00:44.159
It is because of Large Line, one does not have the choice.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.119
One is likely to damage the boat. I already gave the orders.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.300
They will benefit from the situation to destroy it.

00:52.730 --> 00:55.860
I already sent men to deal with the fuel reserve.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.070
And does the vessel pirate that one had located?

00:59.270 --> 01:03.020
By front starboard, to ten hours, distance, 800 meters.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.159
Did you prepare the objects?

01:06.160 --> 01:07.470
Haaa…

01:07.940 --> 01:09.489
With the report/ratio, you dispatch!

01:09.490 --> 01:10.159
Yes!

01:10.160 --> 01:12.469
There are bones on the black house.

01:12.470 --> 01:13.490
How?

01:24.240 --> 01:25.830
Shit…

01:26.580 --> 01:30.040
Didn't we receive the order to stop this kind of gredins?

01:30.230 --> 01:34.270
Their boat advances well quickly in the storm in spite of its small size.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.890
Its crew must be out of the commun run!

01:36.960 --> 01:39.989
Imbecile! Our adversaries are not encouraged!

01:39.990 --> 01:40.820
Yes!

01:46.970 --> 01:50.800
I learned that the Navy was with the continuation of a pirate to the straw hat:

01:51.290 --> 01:53.790
Monkey. D. Luffy and the remainder of its crew.

01:55.750 --> 02:01.760
Already that there are far too many pirates and in here still of others which become famous.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.709
Captain, we have news.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.309
Use the emergency system!

02:08.310 --> 02:09.160
Yes!

02:09.690 --> 02:11.830
We already made 3 miles.

02:12.450 --> 02:13.689
What do you have says?

02:13.690 --> 02:15.630
As I have just said it to you.

02:15.750 --> 02:20.409
According to our information, the pirates gather in trimmings!

02:20.410 --> 02:22.709
Why do they do that…?

02:22.710 --> 02:26.710
You can envisage it?
Or is this too sudden?

02:26.790 --> 02:28.369
Did this race start for a long time?

02:28.370 --> 02:29.549
I believe well.

02:29.550 --> 02:33.549
Well, I see. We have just located another pirate boat!

02:33.550 --> 02:37.199
Really? Continue to supervise the zone.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.119
Another troublemaker is awaited.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.290
Who?

02:41.310 --> 02:42.970
Gaspard.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.449
This wretched individual?

02:44.450 --> 02:48.940
It is exact, it is the wound of the Navy.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.380
One cannot let it act with his own way.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.670
We must maintain the order.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.500
CYB3RFR34K-ISO
PRESENT

03:02.500 --> 03:08.000
ONE PART THE MOVIE
- BOTTOM OF SAC -

03:30.060 --> 03:31.740
Then, what do you become?

03:44.910 --> 03:46.750
Let us take glass.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.110
One will have fun the festival to the paddle.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.929
Don't idiot, you know who I am?

04:13.930 --> 04:15.520
Take that!

04:59.180 --> 05:01.809
Haaa!! I am more hungry…

05:01.810 --> 05:05.060
Not astonishing with what you ate.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.009
I still have place.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.329
Ca is enough.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.999
Food is simple, but really delicious.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.389
Do Nami-san, Robin-chan, you take what for the dessert?

05:12.390 --> 05:13.719
Nothing for me.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.899
I have a coffee.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.360
It left.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.519
I am still hungry!

05:17.520 --> 05:20.159
You ace finished your plate, then you lime pits not.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.020
You do not miss air!

05:22.040 --> 05:25.240
Ca is used for nothing, you will never stop eating.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.129
And here.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.760
Thank you Chief.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.469
The new one?

05:30.470 --> 05:36.040
Impossible to earn money to buy provisions here.

05:36.230 --> 05:37.469
How to make?

05:37.470 --> 05:41.669
What do you say?
Hey! As a captain,

05:41.670 --> 05:44.580
I must say to you that you spend too much!

05:45.930 --> 05:47.769
One very spent to pay your puffs out!!

05:47.770 --> 05:48.840
Good Ah?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.590
But it is really a big problem.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.940
It is not serious. One will find a means well of earning money.

05:56.430 --> 06:02.460
One can work nowhere here.
It only remains us to go towards the next island.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.260
A problem?

06:18.940 --> 06:20.710
A rum, please.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.200
Thank you.

06:27.840 --> 06:31.759
The next island, it, isn't this is Shinabalu?

06:31.760 --> 06:33.020
Yes.

06:46.590 --> 06:49.559
Species of…! Return to me that!

06:49.560 --> 06:50.910
It is with me!!

06:51.510 --> 06:54.079
You will not fight with me for that.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.170
I said to you to stop making the idiot!

07:01.230 --> 07:02.269
Is Nami-san, there a problem?

07:02.270 --> 07:03.559
Not nothing…

07:03.560 --> 07:06.889
I believe that the guy who has just entered is a pirate.

07:06.890 --> 07:11.519
And it made a strange exchange with the barman. Believe me.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.189
Zoro, you ace considering something?

07:13.190 --> 07:16.199
It is too much to be only one simple coincidence.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.069
With what you do think?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.079
Do Oh, go?

07:18.080 --> 07:22.479
Do not take to me for an idiot!
You ace felt well your favorite odor, that of the money!

07:22.480 --> 07:26.440
You show me to be a money devourer?

07:26.470 --> 07:29.059
Because they is false?
Do not insult Nami-san!

07:29.060 --> 07:32.489
It is true, I like over all the money and oranges.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.570
I cannot be mistaken for that.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.239
Luffy, Ussop, Chopper!
The odor of the danger is present here.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.220
It is not the moment to dispute!

07:47.140 --> 07:51.769
Hey, one has really a problem of money.

07:51.770 --> 07:55.950
You would not have a plan to gain much money?

07:57.320 --> 08:01.390
You do not worry, one has to pay the note enough.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.540
But I believe well that can become interesting.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.059
You are only a gamine.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.950
I am also a pirate.

08:17.020 --> 08:22.639
I have well the impression to have already seen you.
Thus you need money.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.679
I have surely something, but you are likely to die.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.549
Perhaps you are right, one could die well,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.340
but one is mown.

08:32.159 --> 08:37.239
And then it will never be known if a tiger is in its cave, if one does not even seek to enter there.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.850
It is perhaps our chance.

08:40.159 --> 08:43.770
To find a treasure such as that one is never simple.

08:43.990 --> 08:47.010
If one wants to avoid the unforeseen ones,

08:47.010 --> 08:51.280
then it will be necessary to be ready to take risks.

08:51.280 --> 08:56.830
One with the practice of this kind of job and one always left oneself there.

08:57.190 --> 09:00.210
When I think of it, our lives are often risked,

09:00.240 --> 09:01.740
but…

09:01.770 --> 09:06.129
My partners are ready with all because of our need for money.

09:06.130 --> 09:11.340
They will not give up because of “a small” danger, especially the Captain.

09:12.630 --> 09:15.890
Now, please, say to me where is

09:16.610 --> 09:18.900
this place which feels gold.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.839
You are most idiotic of the pirates whom I know.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.429
Who it is that it deals with idiot?

09:25.430 --> 09:26.439
It is you?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.479
We are pirates!

09:27.480 --> 09:28.650
Follow me.

09:30.110 --> 09:31.660
Ouais!!

09:39.740 --> 09:41.260
Close the door, quickly!

09:56.150 --> 09:57.839
It is what this tunnel?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.159
Continue straight.

09:59.160 --> 09:59.739
Here?

09:59.740 --> 10:02.459
Continue straight and will arrive there to you.

10:02.460 --> 10:05.009
Wait! You anything said us!

10:05.010 --> 10:05.819
Exact.

10:05.820 --> 10:09.140
I stop here, you of will realize when you will be with the end.

10:09.230 --> 10:10.499
It is not exciting?

10:10.500 --> 10:15.449
Luffy, moron, this history is surely a trap.

10:15.450 --> 10:18.950
Ca would facilitate the things to me if you give up.

10:19.530 --> 10:22.790
One goes there? I am curious to see what there is over there.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.449
Oh! Oh! Curious?

10:25.450 --> 10:28.269
Does Y' have really things of value over there?

10:28.270 --> 10:31.910
I do not lie, but I cannot say some more.

10:33.730 --> 10:36.799
I do not like that of the whole.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.429
Ussop, does not worry you, our captain is trustful.

10:40.430 --> 10:43.730
And then, one does not have any more money, therefore one must go there.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.400
I do not like this kind of reflections.

10:46.430 --> 10:48.839
They is really dangerous where one goes?

10:48.840 --> 10:49.710
Ouais!

10:50.690 --> 10:53.979
One will think later by means of leaving from here.

10:53.980 --> 10:58.500
Then allons-y!
Let us earn money to pay puffs out it!

10:58.620 --> 11:00.240
I do it for you.

11:01.960 --> 11:06.369
When you are there, give two, here is your index.

11:06.370 --> 11:07.940
Thank you pépé.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.419
A last thing.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.350
What?

11:12.300 --> 11:14.490
Why are you pirate?

11:15.380 --> 11:17.250
I want to become the Lord of the Pirates.

11:17.580 --> 11:20.049
And then… we are free.

11:20.050 --> 11:23.960
One can find dangers to be incurred. There are many interesting things.

11:25.950 --> 11:28.710
Especially with a crew such as that one,

11:30.750 --> 11:32.460
then try to survive!

11:44.790 --> 11:45.830
What?

11:46.410 --> 11:47.860
Not, nothing.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.280
Ah!! It is hot!!

11:55.470 --> 11:57.300
Do Zoro, what you make?

11:58.650 --> 11:59.830
It is what?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.680
Sanji-kun, wait!

12:04.810 --> 12:06.380
Zoro, you embarrassments the passage.

12:07.470 --> 12:10.230
Rengainez your sword, I have something for you.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.340
It is what this place?

12:56.320 --> 12:59.129
There is a boat fixed on the ceiling.

12:59.130 --> 13:01.579
The weather is really hot.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.479
It is what?

13:03.480 --> 13:06.900
What it fout up there this boat?

13:08.340 --> 13:09.760
Hey, nice!

13:11.120 --> 13:14.550
Why one would not bet for up there?

13:15.490 --> 13:16.680
Up there?

13:17.720 --> 13:20.480
You are not here for the race?

13:20.580 --> 13:22.150
Oh? A race?

13:22.200 --> 13:26.370
Drop… in any event you will not be able to beat me.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.150
Then it was here?

13:29.150 --> 13:32.249
Ca goes back to so far I have evil with me to remember it…

13:32.250 --> 13:34.050
Qu… what? Speak!

13:34.120 --> 13:38.010
I already came here with the captain from a band from pirates.

13:38.650 --> 13:42.429
Although it on there no date of stopped,

13:42.430 --> 13:46.869
the pirates had decided to organize a race:Dead-End Race.

13:46.870 --> 13:47.989
Organized by the pirates?

13:47.990 --> 13:51.869
This city was always populated pirates in the past.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.920
Ah… of agreement…

13:53.920 --> 13:57.340
The pirates taking part left from here,

13:57.460 --> 14:00.570
and the race was very long.

14:00.700 --> 14:04.420
The rules are very simple.
The first which passes the finishing line gained.

14:04.470 --> 14:09.430
Afterwards, you will seek your silver price and here.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.750
Lastly, if all occurs well…

14:14.830 --> 14:16.750
I see.

14:16.910 --> 14:19.540
It is only one vulgar race.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.770
Ca resembles rather a contest of performance.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.680
I do not believe that one will have problem.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.210
And then Luffy really makes a point of taking part in it.

14:29.580 --> 14:33.299
Hey, which takes part here?
You know it?

14:33.300 --> 14:39.330
Everyone here takes share with the race. That made approximately 300.000 people.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.779
Woa! There are really many people.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.520
In bottom, they are people of the third place.

14:46.730 --> 14:51.300
They make party of the people of the Giants, they are called Bobbi and Boggo.

14:55.550 --> 14:58.630
They take part them too?

14:58.720 --> 15:00.169
Opposite, close to the panel,

15:00.170 --> 15:03.509
it is a former participant, a rival of Arlong,

15:03.510 --> 15:04.960
Hiela.

15:07.620 --> 15:10.200
Ahah… even man-fish

15:10.390 --> 15:12.450
… take part in this race.

15:12.770 --> 15:15.509
Hey Luffy.
Be always decided to you to take part?

15:15.510 --> 15:18.499
Ca is used for nothing to make the race against these guy,

15:18.500 --> 15:21.589
one is likely no to gain.
You me listenings??

15:21.590 --> 15:24.090
With how much is fixed the price?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.849
To 3 million Berrys.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.309
Race, us here!!

15:29.310 --> 15:30.610
Ouais!!

15:34.680 --> 15:36.229
Here is our form.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.989
And the registration fee?

15:37.990 --> 15:38.739
What??

15:38.740 --> 15:40.050
You do not include/understand?

15:40.880 --> 15:41.970
Here.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.970
Hold!

15:53.480 --> 15:54.880
Partia.

15:55.770 --> 15:57.439
Does Ca indicate the arrival?

15:57.440 --> 16:00.949
By hoping that you arrive there without encumbers.

16:00.950 --> 16:02.319
And be careful.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.850
Thank you for your councils.

16:05.440 --> 16:10.029
Odd all this world,
and one saw no boat on the ocean.

16:10.030 --> 16:12.920
It is you who paraded in the middle of the ocean?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.369
Completely.

16:14.370 --> 16:19.320
Everyone camouflaged its ship to prevent here that the Navy discovers us!!

16:26.930 --> 16:30.290
Grandfather, grandfather, rise!

16:31.150 --> 16:33.139
Do not worry you, I am well.

16:33.140 --> 16:34.909
Why you say that you are well?

16:34.910 --> 16:37.699
You have trailed this fever for one week.

16:37.700 --> 16:41.420
It is nothing. Not the sorrow to be concerned with it.

16:42.510 --> 16:44.829
Continue to work.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.809
You should remain with the bed.

16:46.810 --> 16:48.119
I am well…

16:48.120 --> 16:50.130
Grandfather!

16:51.910 --> 16:53.810
Very well, a last question.

16:54.190 --> 16:58.520
Is the departure planned for tomorrow?
One can drink glass without that posing problem?

16:58.700 --> 17:03.319
You do not worry, the race will begin even if you are late.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.430
Included/understood!

17:04.880 --> 17:10.249
Wait! You really believe to be likely to gain?

17:10.250 --> 17:13.709
What? Of course that one can gain!

17:13.710 --> 17:17.930
Marvellous.
You are very enthusiastic.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.378
Who is the favorite?

17:20.380 --> 17:24.069
Gaspard.
It is the Gaspard Captain.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.009
Gaspard?

17:26.010 --> 17:28.639
You know it, Robin?

17:28.640 --> 17:31.149
Ah, I am not really sure.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.930
I wonder of which clan it is?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.619
Ah, where are the different ones and which do make?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.640
Still eating.

17:39.020 --> 17:42.119
Puffs out is free here then they precipitated.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.360
Ah, it is for that.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.469
But you have not just eaten?

17:49.470 --> 17:51.399
It is hardly 6 hours.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.319
And then?

17:52.320 --> 17:55.689
It is necessary to be in full form for the competition of tomorrow.

17:55.690 --> 17:56.499
Full with energy.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.109
You exchanges not.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.650
Does Ca go?

18:08.470 --> 18:10.649
Ca with the really delicious air, give me in!

18:10.650 --> 18:14.220
Not! It is not for you.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.710
I of insane.
Give it to me.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.349
Hey, what you made?
Bring to me to eat.

18:26.350 --> 18:27.760
Yes… a second!!

18:31.790 --> 18:33.120
Hey! Yes, that comes.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.799
This place is brilliant.
By here puffs out it!

18:37.800 --> 18:40.300
You are a truth glouton.

18:51.910 --> 18:53.119
Why?

18:53.120 --> 18:56.710
Why I did that??! Why I did that…

18:58.390 --> 19:00.069
It is rather with me to say that!!

19:00.070 --> 19:01.199
About what you do speak?

19:01.200 --> 19:05.139
The farm! When I think that you lengthened your hands to fly of puffs out.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.249
I card-index myself knowledge how you did that.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.560
My hands…

19:10.050 --> 19:12.259
You cannot do it?

19:12.260 --> 19:13.550
It was not us.

19:13.900 --> 19:17.960
Well.
You will see…!

19:18.000 --> 19:20.989
You ate a Fruit of the Demon?

19:20.990 --> 19:21.929
And then?

19:21.930 --> 19:23.729
There is a problem?

19:23.730 --> 19:27.239
Guesses to which you dared to fly puffs out it?

19:27.240 --> 19:29.840
You do not know?

19:32.030 --> 19:34.739
One is the crew of Gaspard.

19:34.740 --> 19:39.160
You could regret having irritated to us.

19:40.010 --> 19:43.020
One will transform you into trophy.

19:43.820 --> 19:46.800
What do you make?
You try to excuse you?

19:46.920 --> 19:50.140
Hey, it is against me that you fight!

19:54.030 --> 19:55.990
The farm.
Kid!

19:56.670 --> 19:58.610
Pas la pains to look around you.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.260
It is useless, I am out of rubber.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.719
Did Hey, why you do that?
You hurt me!

20:12.720 --> 20:15.379
Afflicted Heu…, I did not want.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.399
Good blood, but from where you leave?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.890
Me? My body is out of rubber.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.660
I am an elastic man!

20:36.860 --> 20:38.210
Does somebody want some?

20:38.350 --> 20:41.099
It is a monster!!
He ate a Fruit of the Demon!

20:41.100 --> 20:43.829
Just like Gaspard!

20:43.830 --> 20:44.969
I do not want to die.

20:44.970 --> 20:48.409
Species of idiot.
How you ace let a kid fight?

20:48.410 --> 20:50.819
I do not support that.
Make them the skin!!

20:50.820 --> 20:52.390
Ouais!

21:34.140 --> 21:36.440
They arrive…

21:36.970 --> 21:37.839
Zoro, deals with them!

21:37.840 --> 21:39.110
Species of…

21:44.980 --> 21:46.839
Dirty fouteurs of shit.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.939
It is which this type?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.019
Ouais, Good!

21:50.020 --> 21:50.809
Funker?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.080
He is there!!

22:04.740 --> 22:08.359
Good blood! You do not believe that you made some too much there?

22:08.360 --> 22:11.950
Imbecile, I will not let to you flee. Do not try to run away itself!

22:12.610 --> 22:13.979
Return!

22:13.980 --> 22:15.639
Do Luffy, you do what?

22:15.640 --> 22:17.129
Nothing, just a baston.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.530
Is Ah, it all?
Pay attention to you.

22:20.180 --> 22:22.030
It is already finished?

22:26.490 --> 22:28.180
Wait, I found it.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.010
Imbeciles!
Ca will not hold!

22:31.760 --> 22:34.390
It is all that a pirate finds to say?

22:34.420 --> 22:35.630
Good…

22:47.590 --> 22:49.630
Do Hey, you want to still fight?

22:50.580 --> 22:52.140
Too much extremely!

22:52.350 --> 22:55.399
I appreciated the spectacle.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.740
Thank you.

22:57.390 --> 23:01.060
I did not think that my opponent was worth 30.000.000.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.220
It is what your name?

23:03.380 --> 23:05.519
Me? I am called…

23:05.520 --> 23:09.369
You could at least listen to what I have to say!

23:09.370 --> 23:10.339
You want to still fight?

23:10.340 --> 23:14.619
Obviously.
And then does not praise you if you are worth 30.000.000.

23:14.620 --> 23:18.799
It was a time when I was worth 90.000.000 of them!

23:18.800 --> 23:21.379
Wow!! Does Ca go back to when?

23:21.380 --> 23:25.009
You really believe to be able you to leave there against all these pirates?

23:25.010 --> 23:26.549
I have a chance that arrives?

23:26.550 --> 23:28.010
Not!

23:34.190 --> 23:35.390
Ciao!

23:37.330 --> 23:41.010
You do not miss air.
Oh, one will discuss that later.

23:48.130 --> 23:51.299
Why did you save?

23:51.300 --> 23:52.449
It was there then…

23:52.450 --> 23:53.759
Good, our baston is continued?

23:53.760 --> 23:55.330
Heard.

23:55.670 --> 23:57.139
Go, one goes there!

23:57.140 --> 24:00.270
Of agreement, but it did not have enough of it.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.590
That is enough like that!

24:04.430 --> 24:06.300
That it is noisy…

24:30.950 --> 24:33.649
Gaspard captain.

24:33.650 --> 24:35.159
What do you make here?

24:35.160 --> 24:35.959
Gaspard?

24:35.960 --> 24:38.649
I do not have the right to be here?

24:38.650 --> 24:43.810
Of course that if.
It was said to me that you drink on board.

24:44.370 --> 24:46.979
I need your permission to leave, it is that?

24:46.980 --> 24:49.289
Not, it is not that… sorry to have disturbed to you.

24:49.290 --> 24:51.320
Have fun!
Please.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.209
I can ask you a last question?

24:53.210 --> 24:54.030
Go ahead.

24:55.420 --> 24:56.919
Who are you??

24:56.920 --> 24:59.389
Who I am?
You speak about me?

24:59.390 --> 25:01.549
Good blood, I am…

25:01.550 --> 25:03.000
I do not know myself.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.870
Nobody in my crew was still beaten…

25:08.060 --> 25:10.429
… by a least that nothing.

25:10.430 --> 25:12.329
Ah, it is that… does it of it is…

25:12.330 --> 25:15.680
Afflicted, I did not finish any yet with him.

25:22.590 --> 25:24.309
What occurred?

25:24.310 --> 25:26.290
The weather is cold.

25:27.630 --> 25:28.900
Salt waste.

25:33.150 --> 25:36.009
What??
It is him Gaspard?

25:36.010 --> 25:37.240
Captain.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.740
You are rather gifted.
Who are you?

25:41.870 --> 25:47.860
I am called Shuraya.
I am an bargain hunter without name.

25:48.230 --> 25:49.119
Shuraya?

25:49.120 --> 25:49.989
He does not laugh?

25:49.990 --> 25:51.509
He captured and killed many famous pirates.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.970
Then it would be him…

25:54.440 --> 25:57.160
It is him Shuraya?

25:58.980 --> 26:01.230
Then you are an bargain hunter.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.090
I am known a little by here.

26:04.150 --> 26:08.909
You do not give the impression to me to be worth 30.000.000.

26:08.910 --> 26:12.570
You is rather gifted, it is interesting.

26:12.570 --> 26:16.200
What you say that.
Would Ca say to you to work for me?

26:16.540 --> 26:20.090
Hey, I am here to capture you.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.510
I know that you made party of the Navy formerly.

26:22.600 --> 26:27.070
If you can fight, that is enough for me.
I love talented people.

26:27.220 --> 26:29.390
I thank you for your compliments.

26:29.490 --> 26:30.889
Then, that do you think about it?

26:30.890 --> 26:31.690
Not.

26:32.670 --> 26:34.900
This type has a head which does not return to me.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.370
My hat…

26:44.870 --> 26:49.189
Not engraves if you take it as that,
but does not insult me!

26:49.190 --> 26:53.240
As you want.
But to what will serve your honor to you?

26:55.750 --> 27:01.400
If you exchanges of opinion, come to see me on my boat.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.880
Why you hold it before the beginning of the competition?

27:12.440 --> 27:14.730
Attention where you put the feet!!

27:16.420 --> 27:19.110
Release! Do not touch with that!

27:19.990 --> 27:21.170
It is my treasure!

27:21.450 --> 27:22.739
This hat is your treasure?

27:22.740 --> 27:26.449
It is a very important gift that Shanks gave me.

27:26.450 --> 27:28.860
Shanks? You know this extraordinary pirate?

27:29.110 --> 27:29.970
Ouais.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.830
You are not an ordinary pirate.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.100
Not, I will become the Lord of the Pirates.

27:35.110 --> 27:38.059
And I am with the research of mysterious One Piece.

27:38.060 --> 27:41.189
But, all those which know something about it…

27:41.190 --> 27:42.770
died.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.150
You are proud.

27:47.700 --> 27:51.289
Do you know what that wants to say to seek in the vastness of the ocean?

27:51.290 --> 27:54.240
Not, because I decided to become a pirate.

27:54.650 --> 27:58.260
If I must die in this combat, it is that it is my destiny.

28:01.530 --> 28:04.000
You are only one small arrogant unconscious!

28:12.770 --> 28:18.530
I am not mood to still beat me. One will give that to later.

28:18.610 --> 28:19.600
Heard.

28:21.590 --> 28:24.020
The next time, it is me which will gain.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.409
I count on you!
Wait!!

28:34.410 --> 28:38.410
The farm!
Do not annoy me!

28:42.610 --> 28:46.449
I take along my grandfather to see a doctor.
He is dying.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.710
I can nothing there, then releases me!

28:48.780 --> 28:51.689
You are not friendly?
You do not have a heart!

28:51.690 --> 28:55.069
Friends? Why devil this old man would he be my friend?

28:55.070 --> 28:56.209
What?

28:56.210 --> 28:57.959
He saved you the life several times already.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.510
Keep silent yourself!

29:00.070 --> 29:01.940
Why do you make noise as much?

29:03.880 --> 29:05.280
Gaspard-Sama.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.519
Please, please, help my grandfather.

29:10.520 --> 29:11.629
Idiot, do not do that.

29:11.630 --> 29:14.219
He has fever and maintaining that worsens.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.469
Please, help it.

29:16.470 --> 29:18.200
Anaguma, that is enough!

29:18.230 --> 29:20.830
Mr Gaspard, I beg you!

29:21.640 --> 29:22.459
Anaguma?

29:22.460 --> 29:27.570
It is the assistant of the old mechanic, he is called Anaguma.

29:27.910 --> 29:30.490
It is what the problem with the old man?

29:30.520 --> 29:33.969
He is sick and he is already old, he will die in any event.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.899
Not if it is looked after.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.979
I already said you that it is useless.
After all it…

29:38.980 --> 29:42.029
I will do all that is possible, I swear it!

29:42.030 --> 29:42.919
Stop saying anything!

29:42.920 --> 29:45.570
Please, look after it!

29:51.880 --> 29:55.380
You cry? You do not have shame?

29:59.590 --> 30:01.130
Release me!

30:03.640 --> 30:05.819
What is… what you intend to make?

30:05.820 --> 30:08.719
I will have to do it myself.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.739
About what you do speak?

30:09.740 --> 30:13.369
Wait. He does not speak like a kid.

30:13.370 --> 30:17.850
I will kill out of the pirates and will take their money to buy drugs.

30:18.030 --> 30:21.509
The calm one. You really believe that this kid will kill somebody?

30:21.510 --> 30:22.609
I will do it.

30:22.610 --> 30:23.569
Do not say anything!

30:23.570 --> 30:24.990
Let do it.

30:25.150 --> 30:30.460
He speaks extremely, he has character, but he is also very stupid.

30:30.640 --> 30:34.409
If you kill it, I will let you join the crew.

30:34.410 --> 30:35.440
Really?

30:35.650 --> 30:39.140
Only insane would do that for one of its close relations.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.130
When you are cured, I will offer a super meal to you.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.509
Is Hey, they good?

31:14.510 --> 31:16.240
Ca can go.

31:40.030 --> 31:42.220
One must move towards this mountain.

31:42.230 --> 31:43.630
Do Nami, you have a problem?

31:43.860 --> 31:47.180
Eternal Poses point in direction of this mountain.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.690
And then?

31:50.790 --> 31:53.969
He said that this city would be the starting point.

31:53.970 --> 31:57.949
One of would go that one ignores you.
You also Zoro.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.220
The farm!

31:59.270 --> 32:01.070
It is what the problem?

32:01.990 --> 32:03.900
No the doubt, it is the departure well here.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.980
The currents are numerous around this island.

32:06.980 --> 32:09.640
Everyone gathers in front of the river.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.230
And thus would that be… this place?

32:12.280 --> 32:17.790
They all were to prepare elsewhere for the departure.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.899
, You wait speak about the top of the mountain?

32:20.900 --> 32:24.099
Exact. There one will have to go to make a turn.

32:24.100 --> 32:27.549
But, from which all this water comes?

32:27.550 --> 32:30.549
Several years ago, there was an eruption here.

32:30.550 --> 32:34.679
And it is necessary to use that to find the way.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.300
Ahh, Robin-chan you are really sensational.

32:37.470 --> 32:39.589
I include/understand essence.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.129
One is not likely to start here.

32:41.130 --> 32:42.570
It is not that.

32:42.860 --> 32:48.079
It is what the problem?
The last time it was similar.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.390
No problem.
One will manage to arrive there.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.300
The wind blows extremely by here.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.459
Luffy, prepares the boat!
Ussop, will take the bar!

33:01.460 --> 33:06.360
Robin, supervises the back, Zoro and Sanji, supervise the sides to avoid the surprises.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.190
Here!

33:39.980 --> 33:42.780
One flies!!

33:47.670 --> 33:51.700
Very well, ahead!!!

34:12.300 --> 34:16.130
I see, it is that he wanted to say by “beginning the voyage”.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.879
One is very popular one would say.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.768
Very well, gum is put!

34:24.770 --> 34:26.899
Made attention! Put the package!

34:26.900 --> 34:30.830
If you put yourself across my way, I kill to you!

34:31.250 --> 34:33.239
It is normal.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.929
But it is which at the end this Gaspard?

34:34.929 --> 34:36.869
You are interested in him?

34:36.870 --> 34:38.780
You spent time to look at it.

34:38.969 --> 34:41.539
Is Wow, necessary really that one goes at the top of the mountain?

34:41.540 --> 34:43.199
Does one nothing impress you, hein?

34:43.210 --> 34:46.759
You to have beaten Gaspard, isn't this must want me?

34:46.760 --> 34:48.130
Really?

34:50.850 --> 34:52.690
I see the other boats.

34:53.929 --> 34:55.469
There is of it also this side.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.560
That one is enormous.

35:06.550 --> 35:09.800
A bateau a vapor.
It is the first time that I see that.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.780
The ship of Gaspard. Salamander.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.880
It is…

35:15.180 --> 35:16.980
It is the symbol of the ship?

35:17.220 --> 35:19.740
It is not the symbol of the Navy?

35:19.940 --> 35:26.139
It took the control of the ship which it ordered and became pirate.

35:26.140 --> 35:28.560
Now, its premium is of 90.000.000 Berrys.

35:28.580 --> 35:31.709
90.000.000…
Ca does much money.

35:31.710 --> 35:35.179
It is true.
And all that with its only force.

35:35.180 --> 35:37.580
It would be said that he ate a Fruit of the Demon.

35:38.450 --> 35:42.790
Formerly it was called the General but nobody any more calls it like that.

35:42.920 --> 35:46.089
It is a good news?
It is a pirate.

35:46.090 --> 35:47.760
It is impossible…

35:47.810 --> 35:48.800
Luffy…

35:48.800 --> 35:50.510
I hate it.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.270
It is really laughable, this boat is ridiculous.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.530
You really believe that it will resist the currents?

36:08.530 --> 36:10.610
That with the tail of horse, it is Bigaro.

36:14.620 --> 36:16.020
It is a very powerful ship.

36:17.220 --> 36:18.980
It is an enormous ship.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.190
Ca continues to go up!!

36:33.320 --> 36:35.430
It is not serious, it nothing will occur…

36:48.820 --> 36:50.780
I believe that you should prepare you in the worst case.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.169
It is that Grand Fall?

37:41.170 --> 37:44.190
Young girl, it is not the moment of rêvasser!

37:55.010 --> 37:56.929
What do they make?

37:56.930 --> 37:58.599
The race started.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.689
All the blows are allowed!

38:00.690 --> 38:03.079
Ussop, will occupy you to the back of them!

38:03.080 --> 38:04.890
Ahh… me?

38:06.430 --> 38:07.769
Release!!

38:07.770 --> 38:09.570
It is not well that.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.999
Included/understood, I occupy myself some.

38:13.000 --> 38:13.980
Really…

38:14.660 --> 38:15.880
Fire!!

38:20.130 --> 38:24.410
Ouais! Here is Ussop gaining truth!

38:45.550 --> 38:50.130
The battle started.
You, everyone prepare!

39:02.850 --> 39:08.259
Bobbi, you cannot turn like that!
Why you do not accelerate?

39:08.260 --> 39:09.850
You are right.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.810
Not!! Not by there!

39:29.200 --> 39:30.609
Chopper, turns the bar at bottom!

39:30.610 --> 39:33.969
It is already done.
But that does not function.

39:33.970 --> 39:35.789
One will be crushed if that continues.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.009
There is not an other way?

39:38.010 --> 39:39.699
Is necessary to find something.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.179
Does Ca help that?

39:41.180 --> 39:42.910
Ah, yes!

39:43.040 --> 39:44.120
Luffy

39:56.780 --> 39:58.140
Luffy!

40:03.340 --> 40:06.680
But… what does one make now?

40:07.390 --> 40:08.810
Curses!

40:18.450 --> 40:21.640
Hey Luffy!!!

40:29.040 --> 40:32.039
It is always the same thing…

40:32.040 --> 40:34.849
One is likely to be still in life.

40:34.850 --> 40:37.999
Robin, thank you, it is of my fault,
I was mistaken in my calculations.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.130
Liar!

40:39.140 --> 40:41.830
Ca starts finally, have fun with that.

40:42.070 --> 40:44.330
I am already very content.

40:44.640 --> 40:48.269
One is still far behind but one has just started.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.459
It is as that which one becomes pirate.

40:50.460 --> 40:52.459
If one gains, one will touch 3 million.

40:52.460 --> 40:52.909
The old problems re-appear once the island was left.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.410
Very well!

41:06.010 --> 41:07.610
Shit!

41:08.600 --> 41:12.829
This bargain hunter and this kid tire me. I rotted here.

41:12.830 --> 41:14.630
It is very awkward.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.119
Good blood, I bump still.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.470
Who asked for a surplus of coal for the salle des machines?

41:21.680 --> 41:23.779
The farm. It is not me which made the decision.

41:23.780 --> 41:26.329
If you do not know, you do not make as you want.

41:26.330 --> 41:27.880
I know!

41:28.320 --> 41:29.959
Where is Anaguma?

41:29.960 --> 41:30.979
Anaguma?

41:30.980 --> 41:32.389
My assistant.

41:32.390 --> 41:37.829
Ah yes, I believe that it joined the pirates.

41:37.830 --> 41:39.130
How?

41:42.420 --> 41:44.469
All the other boats disappeared.

41:44.470 --> 41:48.159
Normal, each ship follows its own road.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.099
And if one ate now?

41:50.100 --> 41:51.089
Good idea!

41:51.090 --> 41:53.319
Can Zoro, you check the damage of the ship?

41:53.320 --> 41:54.990
You want that I do it me?

41:56.100 --> 41:59.210
You have really the technique to make use of people.

41:59.980 --> 42:02.990
Good, let us see whether there are holes…

42:05.040 --> 42:07.490
Anything, it is not a problem.

42:15.790 --> 42:20.390
You chose the bad ship to be stolen.
It is a pirate boat.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.480
A kid?

42:31.840 --> 42:35.679
You do too much of it, you do not even have pity for a kid?

42:35.680 --> 42:37.889
I do not have the choice, it is armed.

42:37.890 --> 42:39.739
It is too…

42:39.740 --> 42:41.210
You are really…

42:41.320 --> 42:44.540
The meal is almost ready.
Put the table.

42:47.220 --> 42:48.480
You are awaked?

42:50.530 --> 42:51.909
The stag speaks!

42:51.910 --> 42:53.319
Not, I am a reindeer!

42:53.320 --> 42:54.249
It is odd.

42:54.250 --> 42:55.829
You lie.

42:55.830 --> 43:00.440
It is not a monster, it is an extraordinary doctor!

43:00.480 --> 43:03.429
Even if it is not very gifted to be expressed…

43:03.430 --> 43:07.659
Idiot, I miss just confidence in me.

43:07.660 --> 43:08.670
Idiot…

43:10.300 --> 43:11.990
It is that which you seek?

43:12.990 --> 43:16.079
You took along that on a pirate boat?

43:16.080 --> 43:18.530
Do not astonish you if you are made kill.

43:18.790 --> 43:21.540
Which is your goal?
Why are you there?

43:23.770 --> 43:28.679
This child is not in good health.
Would not be so malicious with him.

43:28.680 --> 43:33.150
And… I came to kill you for empocher the reward!

43:33.220 --> 43:35.569
Money? You are direct like guy.

43:35.570 --> 43:39.490
There are many pirates elsewhere, why us?

43:39.760 --> 43:45.860
It is normal. He came on the most beautiful boat.

43:46.020 --> 43:49.289
It is not that. This boat is the worst than I ever saw.

43:49.290 --> 43:50.830
Ouais, which joke.

43:50.980 --> 43:53.049
Imbecile, I am serious.

43:53.050 --> 43:54.709
Do not do that. Your body…

43:54.710 --> 43:56.120
Does not approach you more.

43:56.590 --> 43:59.680
The pirates become the targets of the assassins.

44:00.310 --> 44:04.170
If you did not prepare, you are made have.

44:08.630 --> 44:13.050
Show me your determination, unless you would be only one smoothie.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.989
I am not a coward!

44:14.990 --> 44:18.880
Dumb!!

44:24.400 --> 44:28.210
What does that want to say?

44:29.750 --> 44:32.330
Fru. a Fruit of the Demon?

44:33.210 --> 44:35.040
It is exact, you were not with the current?

44:35.450 --> 44:36.829
I never left this ship.

44:36.830 --> 44:38.809
Its body somewhat changed.

44:38.810 --> 44:42.959
The price to be paid for these gifts, it is that one cannot swim any more.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.919
Our Chopper… and Robin have also these capacities.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.929
This stag?

44:47.930 --> 44:49.700
I am a reindeer!

44:53.000 --> 44:55.839
Kill, kill me maintaining me.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.779
Good blood, you dispatch and do it!

44:57.780 --> 45:00.750
You are very determined
But that should not occur like that…

45:00.800 --> 45:03.670
You cheeks with your life, isn't this?

45:03.850 --> 45:09.519
To receive lessons of morals on behalf of a pirate is not important.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.730
To continue to live without goal does not have any direction.

45:13.950 --> 45:15.670
Zoro, lends to me your katana.

45:16.620 --> 45:18.240
Do not wound anybody.

45:18.530 --> 45:20.990
Do not announce pretense of all.

45:21.170 --> 45:23.649
If you really hold to with it, I go exaucer your wish.

45:23.650 --> 45:24.679
Nami, not!

45:24.680 --> 45:25.759
Do not stop me!

45:25.760 --> 45:27.429
I hate the kids in his kind.

45:27.430 --> 45:29.359
Doesn't the life have any direction, hein?

45:29.360 --> 45:33.389
If the life does not have any direction, you have to only burst!!

45:33.390 --> 45:36.750
Stop, that is enough.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.420
The guy, stop it.

45:39.490 --> 45:40.699
The meal is ready.

45:40.700 --> 45:41.930
Sanji!!

45:41.980 --> 45:44.890
Be to you a desperate case.

45:45.300 --> 45:50.990
I want to give a lesson to this kid who does not know the direction of the word gratitude!!!

45:55.280 --> 45:59.259
I am unable to find my grandfather. Death is much better for me.

45:59.260 --> 46:04.079
Do not say similar tricks.
Good things will arrive.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.410
Really?

46:06.200 --> 46:09.150
If you do not want to die, then keep silent yourself.

46:11.010 --> 46:13.670
You seemed so presently determined.

46:14.690 --> 46:17.620
Grand Line is not whole rest.

46:17.900 --> 46:21.440
If you deflated, the remainder of the crew would be well annoyed.

46:24.450 --> 46:27.940
When Nami-san was young,
its family was killed by pirates.

46:28.530 --> 46:32.850
She lived 7 years of a life which one would not wish with anybody.

46:33.250 --> 46:35.710
This reindeer has to him also a tragic past.

46:36.940 --> 46:41.690
Nobody here has a very merry past.

46:41.950 --> 46:44.330
Hey, it is not tragic.

46:45.150 --> 46:50.310
The life is like that, it is necessary to make with the events which emerge.

46:50.930 --> 46:55.390
But if you make with, then the future can only be better.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.320
You measuring rods?

47:05.130 --> 47:08.690
What do you make?
You are nicer than than I imagined.

47:09.900 --> 47:12.110
With is good to reconsider there, for what that used?

47:15.640 --> 47:17.960
I can? It is the list of the participants.

47:19.510 --> 47:24.580
The things as that… that never stops.

47:31.610 --> 47:35.530
You move away even more road, why?

47:37.180 --> 47:41.170
They is good, it is right a play.

47:41.740 --> 47:44.600
It is enough funny to spend time.

47:45.370 --> 47:49.949
Gaspard-Sama!
A ship approaches us quickly.

47:49.950 --> 47:50.579
Who?

47:50.580 --> 47:53.090
Weilis, it is Hiela the man-fish.

47:54.750 --> 47:57.050
As of are the beginning there some who are in a hurry to die?

47:58.450 --> 48:00.990
Gaspard, why this direction?

48:01.270 --> 48:05.870
It is a bad idea.
I have very a good sight.

48:06.010 --> 48:07.930
You have me of course the air of you.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.420
All the crew, you with the combat prepare!

48:12.060 --> 48:14.540
One finally will be able to have fun.

48:14.710 --> 48:15.780
Ouais!

48:16.910 --> 48:20.280
It's a pity that it has no chance to leave itself there.

48:23.820 --> 48:27.370
Your opponents are different…

48:28.220 --> 48:29.219
About what you do speak?

48:29.220 --> 48:30.579
Close it!

48:30.580 --> 48:33.139
This type, it is that which one saw before installing.

48:33.140 --> 48:34.179
It is Bigaro.

48:34.180 --> 48:37.259
Hein? I believed that one was the last.

48:37.260 --> 48:38.960
Then it was them the last.

48:40.060 --> 48:42.139
You will irritate it!!

48:42.140 --> 48:43.620
I all will kill you…

48:43.850 --> 48:45.029
I… had it?

48:45.030 --> 48:46.419
Nice, Ussop!

48:46.420 --> 48:48.920
It was cake.

48:50.210 --> 48:51.569
In your turn!

48:51.570 --> 48:52.379
Good blood.

48:52.380 --> 48:53.619
Very well, then…

48:53.620 --> 48:55.979
Ca fast with us two will be joined together.

48:55.980 --> 48:57.410
Assied.

49:02.580 --> 49:05.470
I have anything against you but I want to beat me.

49:05.760 --> 49:08.640
After that, I will prepare the dinner.

49:10.110 --> 49:12.170
One minute will be enough for us.

49:23.890 --> 49:26.030
They are strong.

49:29.350 --> 49:30.850
It was what this noise?

49:39.290 --> 49:41.699
It is what that??!

49:41.700 --> 49:43.659
They are enormous.

49:43.660 --> 49:45.140
Idiot, does not speak so extremely.

49:49.450 --> 49:52.320
Hey, catches that!

49:53.700 --> 49:55.630
You do aces considering where you have it lance?

50:04.800 --> 50:07.139
Zoro and Sanji did not return…

50:07.140 --> 50:09.250
It is true. Hey…!

50:12.200 --> 50:13.689
Zoro, marvellous.

50:13.690 --> 50:16.169
Why didn't come to you earlier to save me?

50:16.170 --> 50:17.690
I made my better.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.470
They is really delicious.

50:23.730 --> 50:25.970
Don't Hey, you want to eat?

50:27.160 --> 50:28.930
I kept you your share.

50:31.030 --> 50:32.500
You are all the time like that?

50:33.520 --> 50:36.440
You known as that its life should not be risked so easily,

50:36.700 --> 50:39.670
but you do not stop taking risks.

50:39.700 --> 50:42.280
Death does not have anything funny.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.359
But there they was not dangerous.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.869
They is not jokes.

50:45.870 --> 50:47.319
You are not afraid of death?

50:47.320 --> 50:48.109
Of course that if.

50:48.110 --> 50:49.410
Then why?

50:50.470 --> 50:54.430
I was saved by pirates when I were young,

50:54.920 --> 50:57.550
and one of them lost an arm…

50:58.260 --> 51:01.010
Do not die as you failed to do it.

51:01.110 --> 51:02.770
Fortunately that you do not have anything.

51:03.280 --> 51:06.340
It is for that I go from the front one.

51:06.570 --> 51:09.970
There remain to me still things to be made.

51:10.370 --> 51:13.870
It is very hard, but I put myself thoroughly at it.

51:14.150 --> 51:16.560
It is for that that does not have importance

51:17.640 --> 51:20.440
if I were to die in the combat.

51:24.710 --> 51:25.859
Why these flowers?

51:25.860 --> 51:26.549
They are flowers?

51:26.550 --> 51:28.379
Why they fade?

51:28.380 --> 51:30.299
Hey, Sanji. There is a snail.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.750
They is false!

51:42.640 --> 51:45.489
Frérot, the boat cannot go more quickly.

51:45.490 --> 51:46.569
What occurs here?

51:46.570 --> 51:47.900
One draws.

51:48.540 --> 51:52.370
It is… the point of arrival indicated by Partia?

52:02.280 --> 52:03.760
It is what?

52:05.470 --> 52:08.520
It is the Navy which did that?

52:09.670 --> 52:10.960
It ran?

52:10.980 --> 52:12.110
Affirmative.

52:12.670 --> 52:13.909
There is another ship by here.

52:13.910 --> 52:17.100
Still one?
It occurs what today?

52:17.440 --> 52:18.579
Does Nami, what occur?

52:18.580 --> 52:22.009
No the error, it is well the direction indicated.

52:22.010 --> 52:25.710
Are Hey, sure for you that this Eternal Pose functions well?

52:32.410 --> 52:35.490
Good blood, I found that odd.
Then it is that…

52:36.010 --> 52:37.770
Surely a blow of Gaspard.

52:38.130 --> 52:39.280
Luffy…

52:39.900 --> 52:43.230
There is only him to make this type of things.

52:43.310 --> 52:45.599
Then one can nothing draw some.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.409
It is inevitably that.

52:46.410 --> 52:48.930
Wait, I believe that it is by here.

52:50.370 --> 52:56.250
Not a long time ago,
I saw Eternal Pose on his ship.

52:56.360 --> 52:58.849
It is surely a history of treason between pirates.

52:58.850 --> 53:00.389
You are a fine strategist.

53:00.390 --> 53:01.879
And you a wretched dumb.

53:01.880 --> 53:03.699
And you will leave to his continuation?

53:03.700 --> 53:06.199
Without Eternal Poses, it is completely useless.

53:06.200 --> 53:09.380
It is true, it is already too late.

53:10.710 --> 53:12.420
For my grandfather also…

53:12.660 --> 53:14.420
Your grandfather?

53:15.180 --> 53:19.710
It is not my true grandfather,
it is an old man who saved me.

53:19.780 --> 53:23.860
He is very sick… and the crew does not look after it.

53:24.010 --> 53:25.460
It is for that I…

53:26.470 --> 53:28.910
You embarked on this boat to earn money…

53:30.920 --> 53:32.230
Imbecile.

53:33.030 --> 53:37.050
To come here will not help you to save your grandfather.

53:38.160 --> 53:39.480
But…

53:40.060 --> 53:45.499
If you really make a point of living, then say it!

53:45.500 --> 53:48.150
If you are really determined, then helps us!

53:48.340 --> 53:51.850
But do not say that there is nothing any more to make!!

53:52.890 --> 53:53.960
Luffy…

53:54.130 --> 53:58.359
And what do you hope to make?

53:58.360 --> 54:04.529
The timing is perfect.
I just thought of beating this type. You go there?

54:04.530 --> 54:07.129
I also go there, takes along me!!!

54:07.130 --> 54:08.370
Very well.

54:09.530 --> 54:13.790
I do not have the choice.
I must give up the price of 3 million.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.780
We must go to recover Eternal Pose.

54:17.040 --> 54:21.930
Excuse me.
You want to fight against Gaspard?

54:22.220 --> 54:23.660
The enemy approaches!

54:31.140 --> 54:32.880
Very well, ahead!

54:33.060 --> 54:35.459
Wait!
How go-you one to find the good place?

54:35.460 --> 54:36.459
With the nose of Chopper!

54:36.460 --> 54:37.009
Included/understood!

54:37.010 --> 54:38.239
Ah, I see.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.209
I laughed.

54:39.210 --> 54:41.589
They is good.
Let the crew deal with the remainder.

54:41.590 --> 54:42.879
You went by there all length?

54:42.880 --> 54:45.100
Exact.

55:03.570 --> 55:05.290
What do you make?

55:07.590 --> 55:10.910
I will not let myself pose your dirty legs on top.

55:11.960 --> 55:14.619
What do you hope to make me in your state?

55:14.620 --> 55:18.559
Do not make me laugh, I worried just about that.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.759
I strut of the remainder.

55:20.760 --> 55:24.420
You will be made kill one day because of your behavior.

55:24.860 --> 55:28.129
I am somebody of good, not like these pirates.

55:28.130 --> 55:29.499
You believe yourself able to speaking like that?

55:29.500 --> 55:31.919
You go too far!

55:31.920 --> 55:35.400
You do that to be able to pay you to eat.

55:37.270 --> 55:38.910
There is not any more a fuel.

55:39.370 --> 55:42.160
I will be a job.

55:47.390 --> 55:51.699
Who who you would be, you have nothing to do with me but you should not be here.

55:51.700 --> 55:53.090
Included/understood.

55:54.060 --> 55:57.500
I do not want to destroy this ship,
I have too many memories there.

55:58.330 --> 56:00.490
I want to cause a large accident.

56:02.250 --> 56:04.320
It is necessary that I find a chance to kill it.

56:04.770 --> 56:08.160
It is malignant.
This method will not go.

56:11.310 --> 56:13.980
It is true?
To kill Gaspard.

56:14.470 --> 56:18.620
If my body were of agreement, I will help you.

56:20.760 --> 56:22.960
Doesn't Ca go? Pépé?

56:24.020 --> 56:27.669
I am sick but I will not die without to have re-examined Anaguma…

56:27.670 --> 56:28.669
Anaguma?

56:28.670 --> 56:29.989
My assistant.

56:29.990 --> 56:33.660
He works for pirates, to help me.

56:34.450 --> 56:40.420
This dumb of Gaspard turned the head in Anaguma with his lies.

56:43.790 --> 56:44.859
The kid?

56:44.860 --> 56:45.679
You saw it?

56:45.680 --> 56:50.870
I crossed it while leaving, it had the odd air.
You gave up it?

56:50.870 --> 56:53.909
About what you do speak?
I would not have let it die.

56:53.910 --> 56:59.309
In fact, there are some good pirates but those like Gaspard are strange…

56:59.310 --> 57:02.659
It card-indexes life of the children.
People like him…

57:02.660 --> 57:05.569
The kid… I do not believe that he died.

57:05.570 --> 57:09.820
Eh well, until now, all the pirates whom I crossed were all similar.

57:10.100 --> 57:13.930
A cheap bunch of good-for-nothings who drive others completely.

57:16.310 --> 57:19.779
It is odd, I have the impression to have already seen you before.

57:19.780 --> 57:20.719
Me?

57:20.720 --> 57:22.729
You said well that this boat pointed out memories to you.

57:22.730 --> 57:23.850
Which?

57:24.400 --> 57:27.179
You are not there to kill Gaspard?

57:27.180 --> 57:31.379
You must surely have another thing at the head.
Who are you…?

57:31.380 --> 57:34.060
Pépé, you tell anything.

57:34.540 --> 57:38.530
Te delighted not too, because there is a limit with all that.
It is for that I am interested in it…

57:38.940 --> 57:42.970
My father built boats.
He was born in a city considered for that.

57:43.530 --> 57:48.460
One day a boat came for repairs,
but makes some they killed everyone.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.930
It was Gaspard, there is that 8 years.

57:56.280 --> 58:00.949
There was not that some survivors… I lived only and I do not want to continue any more to live like that.

58:00.950 --> 58:06.089
I include/understand what you feel…
isn't revenge?

58:06.090 --> 58:07.830
You did not include/understand anything!!

58:09.090 --> 58:13.200
I laughed, that does not have any relationship with you.

58:14.110 --> 58:18.430
And it is already too late, blood was already versed.

58:18.960 --> 58:22.050
I involved myself very hard and I misled many people.

58:22.700 --> 58:27.370
I will only leave myself there.
I borrow you that.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.699
Idiot, you must cling. As long as you will live…

58:30.700 --> 58:33.780
Pépé, it is already too late.

58:34.870 --> 58:37.799
Good-bye! It is good that Anaguma is still in life.

58:37.800 --> 58:41.170
Wait! Which is your name?

58:42.390 --> 58:46.090
Shuraya! Shuraya Baskedo.

59:00.820 --> 59:03.280
Large-brother!

59:06.100 --> 59:08.220
Andelu!

59:13.100 --> 59:17.040
Hurry, bargain hunter.

59:22.030 --> 59:24.710
Please to me.

59:33.320 --> 59:38.570
I will be honoured to be your adversary, any time, which it grows dark or although you would be burst.

59:39.550 --> 59:45.050
I already listened to your history
I know that you are not here for gold.

59:45.470 --> 59:47.799
You worked here during these 8 years?

59:47.800 --> 59:51.580
And yet you do not have memories,
but it is true that you use that.

59:53.600 --> 59:59.809
Also, I will want to fight against you,
but he also would like to fight against you.

59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.980
I will act as spectator.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.620
Ha, one will see well who will die in first.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.780
You are one of my targets.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.970
Hey, do not damage the boat!

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.820
Hehe, it is finished.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.450
I said to you to pay attention!

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.570
Hold good! Hey!! Awake!

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:33.330
Does that go?
You do not have anything?

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.990
They are the orders of Gaspard.
Burn all that is here!

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.920
And do not leave any survivor!!

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.300
Large-brother!

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.989
Marvellous, it is a very rare boat that we have there.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.520
I believe that one will take it.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.160
And moreover, there are an old man to make walk the engine.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:19.760
You will see…

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.410
I will kill this man, I will not let it be left there.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.210
Attention with its chains.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.370
Die!

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:43.330
The final blow.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:57.810
Good-bye…

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:23.230
What occurs?

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:25.880
Hey, look at over there!

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.870
Shit, the engine has just stopped.
It is likely to explode?

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:50.940
This day… do not say to me…

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.430
Here is capacity of the rain.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.990
It will not even be able to wound it.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.930
It is a true monster!

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.770
Captain, cheer.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.900
And bah then? It is all?

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.280
And me which believed that you would please to me.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.290
I have fun more with toys.

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:47.990
Release.

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:54.720
I will crush you!

01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:58.920
Imbecile!

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:05.210
Gaspard!!!

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.969
Who it is that one?
It is not due to the life?

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:21.159
A survivor?
No importance.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.619
They draw us above, one is foutu.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.679
Won't Ca tell similar tricks?

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.200
The engine stopped.
It would be said that it occurs something.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:32.370
Luffy, do what you can!

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.360
What is it?

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.359
Here me is!!!

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.499
It is what this type?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.629
It is the rubber man.

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:15.910
It returns? Release…!

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.340
Played well!
You can bring us closer to them?

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.359
The other is unable to be controlled.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.569
The farm!

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:40.689
Very well. You behind, made your job.

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:42.630
Would not be too much to trust!

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.550
Beautiful job.
30.000.000 that is deserved.

01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:53.430
Good, you wanted something of me or you prefer to finish like the other?

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:56.520
Why be to you you there?

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.130
I come to take the results.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.620
Let us see seeing what you are worth.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.849
You ace something to say?

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:07.379
Why do you say that?

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.579
Something like that? And that?

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:15.039
All can arrive in this race, then one should not complain.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.149
You are very strong.
Pas la pains to use this kind of method.

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:20.710
And yet…

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.949
It is true.
It is a very interesting play.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:24.639
A play?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.840
Exact, it is a play.

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:32.050
If you cheeks not the play, then how do want you to find happiness in the middle of the ocean?

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.339
These pirates who run after a dream are only one bunch of refuse.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:39.879
Those which keep their treasures did not risk their life much.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.760
Then what is it?

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.699
The true power is needed.

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.429
With power, you can all obtain.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:53.340
I will deal with all these insane who
do not even understand that because of gold,

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:57.720
people as that appear.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:02.450
If you survive, then I will reward you by accepting you among my crew.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.250
Here is the play which we play.

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:08.269
One has all the time that it is necessary.

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:12.270
Well, I see. It is for that you arranged yourself with the organizer.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.170
Now it has to leave the island,
after having benefitted from it to recover all gold.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:23.870
I do not even know if it is still alive.
Its Eternal Pose also is false.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.100
Shit. !

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.710
One was well made have.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:36.090
Grandfather!

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.049
Anaguma.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:38.450
Grandfather!

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:40.300
They is marvellous.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.550
You are well? Species of idiot!

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:48.919
Afflicted. I came to save you grandfather.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.788
To save me?

01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:53.370
I came with pirates who proposed to me to be helped.

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:55.300
Do these pirates want to help you?

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.090
You later will be explained.
But initially, one must escape from here.

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.939
These people are really very strong.

01:09:00.939 --> 01:09:06.500
They said that they were going to run it in broad island. And the boat…

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.988
Ca will go, grandfather, you always say that.

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:17.149
Let us leave now and begin a new life.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.120
Good things could arrive to us.
Allons-y grandfather!

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:26.880
You… it is true?

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.849
Grandfather.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:37.959
Mister the swashbuckler, I count on you to take care of this young man.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.609
It was already my intention.
Dispatch you to go up on board.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.649
Ahead!

01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:44.899
Before that, I have something to make.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:49.220
You made me confidence, Mister the swashbuckler?

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:51.538
Included/understood.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.229
Grandfather.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:55.640
Do not worry you, I return soon.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.210
Then hurries.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.809
Go.

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:02.710
Ok.

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:05.700
This is why… this place… stops that!

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.250
You return at home?

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:12.029
After all that you surmounted to arrive up to now,
one should at least have fun a little.

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:13.610
It is that.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.760
What did you say?
You are damaged?

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:24.630
I do not have time to lose to play your little game and to discuss with you.

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:28.880
Me, I am there that to remove me from you.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.929
Nami-san, you hear me!

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.509
Hurry to return, the situation is already critical!

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:35.129
Eh??

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:36.810
Time…

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:38.480
I feel it badly.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.700
Qu. ? I already felt that before.

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:48.250
If you do not move, I will move before you.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.290
I already warned you that if you fanfaronnes too, you will die.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.340
Wait.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.230
You…

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.250
I go there initially, moves back.

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:05.689
Stop, the broken toys do not have any interest.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:08.730
Insane steps of me!
During these 8 years,

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.490
I survived because I wanted to take my revenge.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.250
My sister, my parents and my friends, they all were killed by you.

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:22.210
I knew that what I did was stupid.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:28.400
And it is for that you must pay for your crimes, Mister Général.

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.840
It is really the most stupid thing.

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:37.539
As you want, I will finish some with you.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.690
Afflicted.

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:45.190
Release!

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.430
What does it make?

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:55.810
It obstructed us, it is only one dirty disgusting frimor.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.310
Do not repeat things like that!

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.980
It is rather your case.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:05.920
Stop saying anything and come to beat you!

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:14.659
That… it is wretched.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:18.039
I ate the Fruit of the Demon of the Rain.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.600
My body can be liquefied as I want.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.639
Shit.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.770
Thus you will strike me in vain, that will not be used for nothing!

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.290
Go! How the spectacle starts!

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.380
Then? Does Ca make good?

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:48.900
Return by there!

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.369
It is their combat, does not interfere you.

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:55.220
But this type…

01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.700
Wait a little.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.570
And then? Do your forces give up you?

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.770
I still want some.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:10.270
To run ships was funnier.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.520
You will die!

01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.150
Ca will hurt!

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.310
Useless…

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.180
I am not edible.

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:50.070
You really do not include/understand the situation.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.259
I will not give up.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.199
You do not have any chance.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.050
It is what one will see.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.520
You are quite presumptuous.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:03.110
You forgot something of important here.

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:08.120
It is a very invaluable hat I believe,

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.710
a trick that Shanks the Russet-red one gave you.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.030
It is not with me, I must return to him!
Does not touch it!

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.709
It is well damage, my large.

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:24.749
Stop, if you it keys, never I will not forgive yourself it!

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.069
Do imbecile, what you believe capacity to make me?

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:29.480
Stop!!!

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.930
Dumb!!!

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:43.189
I give you that, you will return it to me when you become a pirate out of the commun run.

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:48.110
I will find One Piece.
And I will become a large pirate!

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.060
That… that made of the good.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.700
Return to me this hat!!

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:10.320
It is really so invaluable?

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.220
Very well… I return it to you.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.320
Eh well… that really does not resemble a combat.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.170
Time changes, I feel a great power.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.450
A great power?
It is like…

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.880
Attention with the last obstacle.
You dispatch!

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:45.989
You prepare, we must leave from here immediately.

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:47.489
But Sanji and Luffy…

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.949
One card-indexes oneself some!!

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:52.380
Luffy, do not lose too much time.

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:55.750
There will be a storm soon here.

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:16.209
It is enough embarrassing, but I want to be with you.

01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:18.300
About what you do speak grandfather?

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.780
You are you still there?

01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:24.169
Of course. What do you make here with speaking all alone?

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:27.530
Straw hat fights against Gaspard.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.030
All the others were beaten.
There remain only you.

01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:34.539
This boat is running.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.020
You should leave from here as long as you still can it.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.980
What?

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:45.830
Grandfather.

01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.070
Who is this?

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:49.839
It is me.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.890
What do you make?
Dispatch you to leave!

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.860
Don't grandfathers you come?
This child awaits you!

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.449
Afflicted, this child is very important for me.

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:05.750
But at the end of the day,
I will want to remain in the salle des machines.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.510
Quickly! Run!!

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.540
This boat soon will explode!

01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:18.439
Luffy…

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.050
Is it well?

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:24.980
No doubt, the wind blows by here.

01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:26.749
This guy…

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:30.600
The insane one, it can be still raised.

01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:35.209
To be raised request much of effort.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:38.730
I will not forgive myself for that!!

01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:43.120
Stop, your attacks are useless.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:46.090
You do not even arrive to me at ankle.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:51.070
Then it is all that somebody who is worth 30.000.000 can do?

01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:54.130
I will kill you quickly, and without pain.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:57.250
I will kill you with kindness.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.640
It is finished? The boat is running.

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:27.560
Quickly, passes in first.

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.810
The combat is not finished.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.610
I hear it well.

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:40.890
Ca makes a long time that I did not test that.

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:44.420
It is not possible.

01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:47.879
Afflicted, I pass in first.

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.549
Does Ca go?

01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:49.279
At all.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.279
Let to me give that.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.329
It is what?

01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:53.800
Use it advisedly.
I slip by!

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.459
Sanji, you are late.

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.669
Let us leave quickly from here, this place is dangerous.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:05.060
It is true… something of enormous arrives.
Where is Luffy?

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.950
What? You did not leave to seek the grandfather?

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:12.230
It decided to remain in the salle des machines.
There remains nothing any more but one minute.

01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:24.159
It is what this joke?
Quickly, turn over there!!

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.909
Why left it to you on the boat?

01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:30.359
You had not said that you would save it?
Then why…

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.029
Luffy?

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.880
It is always on the boat…

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:34.869
Zoro?

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.089
It is better like that.

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:38.030
Pas la pains to strike it.

01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:42.180
You had not guessed?

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.540
This child… it is a girl!

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:26.599
Isn't Luffy is well?

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.609
I do not know anything of it.

01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:30.859
How that don't you know anything of it?

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.769
With the explosion, it has…

01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:35.639
And the grandfather… why?

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.909
All is…

01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:40.029
All what? I do not include/understand what you speak.

01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:42.759
Quickly, is necessary to go to save Luffy.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.920
Wait. It is always in life.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.120
And Gaspard too.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.390
What? What occurred?

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.260
Where it passed the different one?
It ran?

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:08.300
I am here!

01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:17.160
You did not slip by yet?

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:20.080
Did your crew already leave?

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.159
Would it have given up you?

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.310
Idiot. They are my friends!

01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:28.480
I do not have a crew on my boat.

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:33.039
What is they that these conneries?

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.490
You are a pirate and you believe in the friendship?
Do not card-index yourself ego.

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:40.730
In the middle of this ocean, it east “eats or is eaten”, it does not have there other rules.

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.669
Only the power counts.

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:48.079
Although I hate the sea, it is for that I left the Navy to become pirate.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.010
But I have the capacity.

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:54.840
It is for that which I think that you are only one large moron.

01:21:55.830 --> 01:22:00.070
You do not include/understand.
It is for that you say this kind of idiocies.

01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:06.290
If you do not rely on your companions,
then you merits not to be a pirate.

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:09.420
This guy, I will do myself it.

01:22:10.190 --> 01:22:11.530
Now!

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.000
Very interesting.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.739
You are the first to have held so a long time me head.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:22.910
To show you my respect, I will finish some with you.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.270
There is a launch behind me.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.320
And looks behind you…

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:33.410
Ah!!! What is it?

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.460
You are surprised?
This launch is also very fast.

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:42.240
Ca is badly, in fact worst things could arrive.

01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:46.810
Very simple, gaining it the right to life will have.

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.690
Go!

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:58.540
Ca is not used for nothing, that does not go with me.

01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:05.820
Ca hurts!

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.119
Why?
How did it make to touch me?

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.160
It is…

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.280
Flour…?

01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:23.200
I cannot lose!

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.430
It left!

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:44.910
You ace not right to be a pirate, Gaspard!!

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.880
It is the end.

01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:03.040
Idiot, that does not walk with me.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.860
It is my turn, take that!!

01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:14.880
Do idiot… you believe capacity to touch me?

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.380
Thus die!

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.670
Lastly, it is finished.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.840
I gained.

01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:49.610
You saw that?

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.049
It sent it packing.

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.900
Isn't Luffy does not have any more a force?

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.080
If one grouille not, that badly will finish.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:03.920
Be not made a concern.

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.960
You are not anxious?

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.480
It is always like that.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.970
We have faith in our Captain.

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:37.949
You do not make fun of me.
I am always in life.

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.860
You pleasant?

01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:44.869
Is grandfather, it what this acoutrement?

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:47.470
I used it for

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:51.560
you to make go up on board.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.289
Straw hat!

01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:58.150
It is him which overcame Gaspard.

01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:04.890
In fact, it was useless to save me.

01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:07.510
I do not have any more reason to live.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.330
My goal was to kill Gaspard.

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:14.810
And it is a type with a straw hat which overcame it.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.800
I do not have any more reason to live.

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:23.330
I am not so sure.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.840
God likes to play with the men.

01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:30.259
What do you want to say?

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.460
It is a very deep wound.
You know it??

01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:37.210
It is for that I decided to say to you…

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.260
You a sister, isn't this has?
Eh well, it is always in life.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.719
What? 8 years ago, my sister is…

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.860
This day, I saved a young girl of the river, it was 3 years old.

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:56.240
And according to my memories,
it was called Andelu Baskedo.

01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:04.300
Grandfather…

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:11.079
Grandfather…

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:17.260
The life is full with surprises.
It is formidable of living.

01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:23.399
Excuse me, but could you adopt it?

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.129
I am too young to be mother.

01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:27.639
Didn't grandfathers, you die?

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.889
Me?

01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:32.499
Idiot. I wanted simply to say good-bye to the salle des machines.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.010
I did not intend to die.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.719
They are not good.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.319
Nothing there can.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.579
Their to learn as that which they are brother and sister.

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.479
My hat… it is lost.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.609
One can nothing make there, it is lost.

01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:55.170
My hat…

01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:57.180
Here it is.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.410
My hat!

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.369
You…

01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:06.559
It was really important for you?
It was beside my foot, then I collected it.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.240
Thank you!
You are really nice!

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.749
Can Nami, you help me to arrange it?

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:14.160
Yes…

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.760
You see this island?

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.479
It is the arrival, one is there thanks to the compass of the grandfather!

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.920
Thus…

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.300
One gained!!

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.669
Do not make the head.

01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:36.189
It is not that…

01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:38.789
I believe simply that I lost my statute.

01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:40.970
Statute? How that?

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.110
To stop each time to obtain what one wants.

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:48.339
One is not different from Gaspard.

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.129
What? What do you want to say?

01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:53.880
Do not worry you for that, it is past.

01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:57.390
Now, it is necessary to think in the future.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.560
It is going from the front one.

01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:07.570
Be not made a concern, take your time.

01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:09.670
All is finished.

01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:13.639
Navy!!

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.600
What do they make here?

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:18.190
They followed us or what?

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.840
You made us well wait, pirates!

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.819
One will make you the skin!

01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.539
Shouldn't captain, one make an investigation before rather?

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.380
Pas la pains.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.350
All troops, ahead!

01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:41.529
Why you made that,
you, isn't this saved us?

01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:43.890
Not, it is that…

01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:48.469
… we are pirates,
and under these conditions, one must flee.

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.279
But…

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:56.360
You must live elsewhere, in a place enlightened by the sun and benefit from the life.

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.830
But…

01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:02.870
The life is worth the sorrow to be lived.
Goodbye!!

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.450
Take care of you!

01:30:05.210 --> 01:30:07.360
And, you become an extra woman hear me?

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.290
And especially, you must say what you think of your manner!

01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:11.970
Goodbye.

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.190
Made attention…

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:26.540
You intended to save me since the beginning.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.120
Forget all that, one will be re-examined more.

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.510
, Pirates dispatch you to leave!

01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:36.560
Goodbye!!

01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:40.759
Made attention with you!!!

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:45.180
You too!!

01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:47.510
Thank you!!

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:52.330
Grandfather, I do not include/understand.

01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:58.290
It is necessary you to start again with living since the beginning.

01:30:58.630 --> 01:30:59.920
It is that.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.490
What? It makes half-turn.

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.820
This year, there is no winner.

01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:10.199
There is not an other solution.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.799
It is the type with the straw hat.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.129
What?
The type on the poster?

01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:17.100
Posts it?

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.450
It is worth a package!

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:21.759
The poster has just been sent here.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.479
It is worth 100.000.000 Berrys.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.540
More that Gaspard!

01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:27.569
Do not make this head?

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:28.279
What??

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.470
Good-bye the kitty of the 3 million Berrys.

01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:36.779
Do not tell me things like that!

01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:41.190
This situation… because of Gaspard!!

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.179
I will never forgive him!!

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:46.319
I can breathe more…

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.519
Forget all that.
There remains to us a long way.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:53.199
One will on another occasion.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.609
Ouais… Nami-san.

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:57.750
Is better to deal with them maintaining.

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.820
Do not go there… the guy…

01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:07.460
I do not want life poor like that.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.409
Quickly, is necessary to give up from here!

01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:13.719
Yes… Nami-san!

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.189
Go, the Lord of the Pirates…

01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:19.599
… goes towards its next destination!

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.979
I am beautiful an imbecile.

01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.510
Everyone, one goes there!!
