00:00.935 --> 00:02.368
<i>You're watching</i> The Grinder.

00:02.370 --> 00:05.104
- For justice?
- For justice!

00:05.106 --> 00:07.306
<i>Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays,</i>

00:07.308 --> 00:09.008
<i>and check out
our other Fox programs...</i>

00:09.010 --> 00:10.843
Scream Queens, Empire

00:10.845 --> 00:12.378

00:12.380 --> 00:14.380
This is Edie,
your granddaughter.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.552 --> 00:19.852
I've not lost a check
in 15 years.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.520
You lost this check!
That's not the check.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.222
Tell me why
this can't be the check!

00:23.224 --> 00:24.957
Because I destroyed the check!

00:24.959 --> 00:27.459
(shouting, gallery gasping)

00:27.461 --> 00:28.961
Open it.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.229
"Grinder rests."

00:30.231 --> 00:31.230
(whooping)

00:31.232 --> 00:33.265
(applause)

00:52.253 --> 00:55.154
You lost to an actor?

00:57.758 --> 01:00.092
MAN: <i>Always keep...</i>

01:00.094 --> 01:01.560
<i>We've got him on...</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:02.861
DEAN:
<i>I know that all of you are...</i>

01:02.863 --> 01:04.663
<i>Lord knows, how hard...</i>

01:04.665 --> 01:06.265
<i>You lost this check.</i>

01:06.267 --> 01:07.566
WITNESS: That's not the check.
LEONARD:<i> Objection.</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:10.102
DEAN: <i>Tell me why
this can't be the check!</i>

01:10.104 --> 01:12.104
(echoing applause)

01:12.106 --> 01:13.605
WOMAN:
You need to settle, Grinder.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.340
GRINDER: Don't settle, ever!

01:15.342 --> 01:16.608
Always keep one in the chamber.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.043
That was my merger!

01:18.045 --> 01:19.278
My stock options!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.279
MAN: It's Grinder!

01:20.281 --> 01:21.380
WOMAN: Damn you, damn you!

01:21.382 --> 01:23.782
She wasn't on the rooftop.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.085
Damn you?! Damn myself!
How is why!

01:26.087 --> 01:27.286
Too risky is not
in my vocabulary.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.454
(Grinder screaming)

01:28.456 --> 01:31.256
I'm the freaking Grinder!

01:31.258 --> 01:33.325
¶ ¶

01:35.729 --> 01:37.096
It all comes full circle.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.230
So...

01:38.232 --> 01:39.465
you do know who's behind it?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.700
The identity
of the puppet master?

01:41.702 --> 01:42.968
That's right, Todd.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.403
The man pulling the strings
behind the curtain

01:44.405 --> 01:46.305
on Dad's case. Leonard Velance.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.074
The opposing counsel
in my first non-TV trial.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.142
We humiliated him

01:50.144 --> 01:51.376
in front of the world...

01:51.378 --> 01:54.213
and now he wants revenge.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.247
TODD: Damn!

01:55.249 --> 01:56.582
How did I not see that?

01:56.584 --> 01:58.584
Don't beat yourself up, Todd.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.486
It took me a long time
to get there, too,

02:00.488 --> 02:03.655
but it's the only thing
that makes sense.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.656
Does it make sense?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.091
The opposing counsel?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.559
The Pakistani-American guy.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.561
Stew, it's almost racist
that you don't remember him.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.096
How? I remember him.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.097
I just don't know why you're

02:12.099 --> 02:13.165
so sure he was behind it.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.333
You're kind of basing

02:14.335 --> 02:15.400
all this off a random hunch.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.401
Not a hunch.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.336
Nothing random about it.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.470
It's called instinct.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.638
I have it.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.006
You have it,
and it's time for us

02:21.008 --> 02:23.108
to push our chips in on it.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.143
I mean, I just don't see
a version of this

02:24.145 --> 02:25.244
where I say no and it sticks.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.845
That's because there isn't one.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.280
(whispering): There isn't one.
Todd?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.815
What... What?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.316
I could feel your
breath on my neck.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.318
Sorry, I'll-I'll sit down. Yeah.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.088
DEAN:<i> Your Honor, we have</i>

02:36.090 --> 02:38.023
always known that
this case is nothing more

02:38.025 --> 02:40.259
than a smokescreen for revenge.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.194
We just didn't know
who was behind it...

02:42.196 --> 02:43.529
until this morning.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.030
Okay.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.632
Basically, Mr. Manler
has been represented

02:46.634 --> 02:48.800
by counsel this whole time,
and he's been hiding it.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.502
Okay.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.704
Don't you think
that's a little weird?

02:52.706 --> 02:55.040
I don't think
it's weirder than this.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.016
Video sent to me
from the plaintiff.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.617
He lured you to that apartment.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.618
Your Honor, I can explain.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.719
CLAIRE: <i>So, you're off</i>

03:07.721 --> 03:08.687
the case?

03:08.689 --> 03:09.888
The guy has footage of me

03:09.890 --> 03:10.956
breaking into his apartment.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.524
I'm suspended for six months!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.226
Damn. Now what?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.527
So, now it looks like
you're gonna have

03:15.529 --> 03:16.795
to take over as lead counsel.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.331
Wow, okay, great.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.166
Um, I guess I'll start prepping.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.634
You want to tell Dean?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.136
Yeah, or-or you can,
you know, what-whatever.

03:24.138 --> 03:25.304
I think, whatever,
they both work for me.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.638
I'd tell him...

03:26.640 --> 03:29.141
but somehow I think
he knows already.

03:29.143 --> 03:30.576
Dean, please, do not make this

03:30.578 --> 03:32.211
any more difficult
than it has to be.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.179
Stewart, I thought that
we'd come full circle,

03:34.181 --> 03:36.081
but you still don't trust me.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.583
You want me to have
training wheels.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.484
Um, I just, I still feel
like there should be

03:39.486 --> 03:40.652
an actual lawyer in charge

03:40.654 --> 03:42.154
of the case, so just

03:42.156 --> 03:43.255
listen to Claire.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.556
Okay.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.361
Yeah. I'm torn.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.263
Yeah? What are you torn about?

03:51.265 --> 03:52.731
Well, I love seeing
a diverse woman have

03:52.733 --> 03:54.099
a shot in the workplace.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.200
I feel good about that.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.335
I think a lot of people do.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.203
And on the other hand?

03:58.205 --> 04:00.339
It should be me.

04:00.341 --> 04:04.509
Defending my father
with my brother.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.745
Surrounded by my...

04:06.747 --> 04:09.514
extended family while I...

04:11.118 --> 04:13.218
(softly): Fight for justice.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.253
ETHAN: <i>How much of this</i>

04:14.255 --> 04:15.687
is about proving to Grandpa

04:15.689 --> 04:17.856
that you're as worthy
of love as Uncle Dean?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.458
This is for your school paper?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.026
Yeah, we're doing
a piece on the trial.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.762
Okay, wow, you guys
really go deep.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.964
This cool? Yeah, sure.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.366
Is your legacy on the line?

04:27.368 --> 04:28.467
LIZZIE: Does your career hinge

04:28.469 --> 04:29.768
on the outcome of this case?

04:32.373 --> 04:33.739
WOMAN (over TV): I mean,
she's been known to backstab.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.707
Whoa, they are rough.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.542
I told you so.
I'm watching this.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.311
What did they ask you? Shh!

04:39.313 --> 04:41.480
Oh, I see,
you're a little, uh...

04:41.482 --> 04:42.714
A little what? You weren't
like this when you got

04:42.716 --> 04:43.782
interviewed, right?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.285
You drank afterwards. Yes!

04:46.287 --> 04:47.786
You have no idea what you said, do you?
Nope, none.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.054
Well, fingers crossed
because if you

04:49.056 --> 04:50.055
said anything,
they're gonna use it.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.556
What? Ah, look at this.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.392
My opening statement.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.593
I don't know, I think I was

04:54.595 --> 04:55.794
kind of looking forward
to it, you know,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.396
defending my dad in court.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.498
And now you can't
'cause you got suspended!

04:59.500 --> 05:00.832
What?! I would definitely

05:00.834 --> 05:02.434
get my hands on that tape
if I were you.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.902
(sighs)

05:04.972 --> 05:07.472
(sighs)

05:09.076 --> 05:10.676
You don't think I can win.
(gasps) Dean!

05:10.678 --> 05:12.577
Seriously?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.313
You'd rather have
Claire run this than me.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.580
(sighs)

05:15.582 --> 05:18.250
Uh... maybe, yeah.

05:18.252 --> 05:20.652
You know, she's a-an actual
lawyer or whatever.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.820
You know,

05:21.822 --> 05:22.788
you do that a lot.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.356
You sort of trail off

05:24.358 --> 05:25.857
with a little insult
under your breath,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.426
and you think that
I don't hear it.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.860
Well, I do.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.763
I hear every one of them,
and they hurt me.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.433
Okay, Dean, I'm sorry,
but can you honestly tell me

05:34.435 --> 05:36.368
that she isn't better qualified...
Stewart,

05:36.370 --> 05:38.603
how long are you gonna keep
the training wheels on me?

05:38.605 --> 05:39.838
I don't know, Dean,
probably until you go

05:39.840 --> 05:41.006
through the legal
training process.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.541
Sure, go to law school,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.042
pass the bar,
as if that's the only way.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.644
That's everybody's way, Dean.
You're the only one

05:45.646 --> 05:47.279
who doesn't think you have
to do it that way.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.647
Stewart, what is your prejudice
against TV lawyers

05:48.649 --> 05:50.482
becoming real ones?
Is that a prejudice?

05:50.484 --> 05:53.518
Tomorrow when we walk into
the courtroom, law school,

05:53.520 --> 05:56.722
training, who's a great lawyer,
it all goes out the window.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.957
That's not true. Because it's
not about the law anymore.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.425
It's about instinct...

06:01.528 --> 06:03.295
and I just hope your girl has it

06:03.297 --> 06:04.696
or we are all

06:04.698 --> 06:07.399
in a heap of trouble.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.568
Trouble you got us into.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.650
I heard that! All
right, all right.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.477
All right, let's begin.
I'm excited for this one.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.313
Uh, Your Honor, I'd like
to retain counsel at this time.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.348
Told you.
Okay, and where is your counsel?

06:23.350 --> 06:25.250
LEONARD: Right...

06:25.252 --> 06:25.984
behind...

06:25.986 --> 06:27.853
all of you.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.254
(gallery gasping)

06:30.824 --> 06:31.990
I knew it.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.692
Took you a while, though.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.160
But I figured it out.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.328
What does that get you?

06:36.330 --> 06:38.897
Like, you know it's me,
now what?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.434
JUDGE ADAMS: Okay.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.169
And the defense has also
added a member to the team.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.737
Yes, Your Honor,
I will be taking over

06:45.739 --> 06:47.339
for Mr. Sanderson
as lead counsel.

06:47.341 --> 06:48.907
That's your decision?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.013
No, it's not, Your Honor.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.348
Uh, yes, it is, Your Honor.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.849
Uh, you're not allowed to talk.

06:57.851 --> 06:58.917
Uh, okay, but I just
wanted to clarify...

06:58.919 --> 06:59.951
DEAN: Stewart.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.033
Did you hear the judge?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.522
I want my son here to be

07:03.524 --> 07:04.523
the lead counsel, Your Honor.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.725
Really? Stand down, Lacoste.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.260
It's me he wants.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.028
JUDGE ADAMS: Okay.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.263
I guess, Ms. Lacoste,
you're out.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.531
We'll take a short recess,
and come back

07:12.533 --> 07:13.865
with Mr. Sanderson
running point.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.133
How's that sound?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.635
That sounds really great,
Your Honor.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.569
Thank you.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.538
Sounds<i> really</i> great.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.639
Thank you.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.907
Sounds fantastic, thank you.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.642
Thank you times a million.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.243
No one thanks you more than
I do, nobody in this courtroom.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.212
So excited.
This is gonna be wonderful.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.581
Your Honor, this-this will be
the best day of my life.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.743
(gavel bangs) Thank you.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.052
Counselor. Dean.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.921
I know that this is
not what you wanted,

07:35.923 --> 07:38.723
but it would mean a lot to me
if I got your blessing

07:38.725 --> 07:40.158
before I went back in there.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.560
There's just a lot
at stake in there.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.727
Dad could be disbarred.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.963
Don't you think I know that?

07:44.965 --> 07:45.897
You don't think that this

07:45.899 --> 07:47.065
keeps me up at night?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.300
Then let me help you.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.135
Here.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.603
Your cards.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.004
Yeah.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.607
I'll cherish them...

07:55.609 --> 07:57.275
and I will carry them
with me into battle.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.276
No, use them, Dean.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.911
They're not a-a keepsake.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.646
That's... I want you
to use them in court.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.281
Use them how? Read what
I wrote on the cards,

08:03.283 --> 08:05.083
and I think we have
a chance here.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.751
You want The Grinder
to read cue cards.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.086
I mean, isn't that
kind of what you do?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.087
That would be like
having a racecar

08:09.089 --> 08:10.589
and keeping it in second gear.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.424
Good, stay in second gear.
Second gear will win this case.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.593
I would say second gear
wins this<i> race.</i>

08:14.595 --> 08:16.428
I see how that's better. Fine.

08:16.430 --> 08:20.332
I will read your words,
color-coded cards.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.334
I'm not gonna like it!

08:22.336 --> 08:24.035
Hey, so, um...

08:24.037 --> 08:25.704
how's your story coming?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.272
It's going, it's good, yeah.
Is it?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.773
Um, I was wondering if

08:28.775 --> 08:29.841
I could just maybe
give it like a...

08:29.843 --> 08:31.776
like a... like a little listen.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.211
Why, 'cause you were
two bottles deep?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.813
And you can't remember what you said?
What?!

08:34.815 --> 08:36.781
No, no, I want to go back

08:36.783 --> 08:38.783
and listen because I feel like

08:38.785 --> 08:39.985
maybe I didn't give you guys

08:39.987 --> 08:41.019
a good enough interview.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.120
Maybe there's some, you know,

08:42.122 --> 08:43.655
like, details that I left out

08:43.657 --> 08:45.090
that could help your story.

08:47.828 --> 08:48.994
Give me that. Give me that!
Mom, no!

08:48.996 --> 08:50.729
Wait, just wait, just let me...

08:50.731 --> 08:51.863
(Lizzie shouting)

08:51.865 --> 08:53.131
I just want to listen
to a little of it.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.666
That's just sad.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.201
You're having, like,
a mental breakdown.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.802
(scoffs)

08:57.804 --> 08:59.004
All righty,

08:59.006 --> 09:00.305
let's do this.
Opening statements.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.973
Mr. Sanderson?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.975
Yes, uh, Your Honor,
if I could just have

09:03.977 --> 09:06.077
one moment to...

09:06.079 --> 09:07.212
organize my

09:07.214 --> 09:08.647
cue cards.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.648
Come on.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.649
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

09:10.651 --> 09:12.817
here are the faces.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.819
Facts.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.190
In 1988, the plaintiff

09:19.192 --> 09:23.328
Cory Manler was charged
with pretty theft...

09:25.532 --> 09:27.165
was charged with petty theft.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.601
What the hell is this?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.169
It's my opening statement.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.104
It's not him. Cut him loose.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.773
In the judgment of the court...

09:34.775 --> 09:36.841
of the second city. Psst.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.943
(whispering): Dean.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.110
(mouthing)

09:39.112 --> 09:40.078
(mouthing)

09:40.080 --> 09:40.946
Um, what is this?

09:40.948 --> 09:42.213
(mouthing)

09:42.215 --> 09:43.682
(mouthing)

09:43.684 --> 09:44.716
Your Honor, you're just
gonna let this happen?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.017
Shh, shh, let them finish.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.119
(mouthing)

09:49.022 --> 09:50.288
Your Honor...

09:50.290 --> 09:51.289
I would like to, uh,

09:51.291 --> 09:53.058
back this up. You want to...

09:53.060 --> 09:54.192
Yeah, I want to take
it from the top.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.694
I'm sorry,
I was working my way into it,

09:55.696 --> 09:57.295
and I think I've got
something going now.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.030
Really, we're just letting
him take it again?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.992
I don't see why not. Ladies
and gentlemen of the jury.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.337
Family is
the bedrock of society...

10:06.373 --> 10:08.273
and society is

10:08.275 --> 10:09.774
the bedrock of justice.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.976
Ah, but justice...

10:10.978 --> 10:12.277
(knocks on rail)

10:12.279 --> 10:14.713
sweet, sweet justice...

10:14.715 --> 10:16.147
and it's tricky,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.617
but it doesn't mean that it

10:18.619 --> 10:21.720
is not the bedrock of this case.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.191
Counselor.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.062
Look, I get it.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.931
He's The Grinder.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.233
Handsome, charming, famous,

10:35.235 --> 10:36.968
he's fun to watch but...

10:36.970 --> 10:40.271
I'm begging you, pay attention

10:40.273 --> 10:43.742
to the content of his words.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.076
Could any of you recap it?

10:45.078 --> 10:48.179
Or even give me the gist of it?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.914
No, you know why?

10:49.916 --> 10:53.752
Because it was nonsense.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.620
So, I'm on location doing
a picture with, uh,

10:55.622 --> 10:56.755
Edward James Olmos.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.356
We're sitting around crafty,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.692
and, uh, he turns
to Eddie... Norton...

11:00.694 --> 11:01.760
Ed Norton

11:01.762 --> 11:05.196
practically falls off his horse,

11:05.198 --> 11:07.866
which he should never
have had at craft service,

11:07.868 --> 11:09.634
because it might have
been eating the food.

11:09.636 --> 11:10.635
(laughter)

11:10.637 --> 11:13.772
Okay... so that

11:13.774 --> 11:16.041
was a 30-minute story
about two celebrities

11:16.043 --> 11:18.677
getting acting advice
from a third celebrity,

11:18.679 --> 11:19.811
but...

11:19.813 --> 11:22.047
it has no relevance

11:22.049 --> 11:23.982
to this case.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.284
Is he allowed to just dissect
every single thing that I say?

11:26.286 --> 11:27.318
Yeah, that's being a lawyer.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.319
Uh, it's kind of what
he's supposed to do.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.320
Yeah. Yeah.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.722
And he's scoring with the jury!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.223
I can see it in their eyes!

11:32.225 --> 11:35.226
I can't believe they're
buying Velance's bullcrap!

11:35.228 --> 11:36.695
Dad, they are definitely
gonna put you on the stand.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.830
So, Dean, your best
weapon is objecting.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.331
Challenge them on
everything they say.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.900
Yes, here is a list of reasons

11:41.902 --> 11:43.334
you can object to testimony.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.170
Oh, there's a list.
Good, I-I thought you had

11:45.172 --> 11:46.838
to make something new
up each time.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.673
Well, that's the way it
should be if you ask me.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.974
Amen. Oh, so...

11:49.976 --> 11:51.743
worst case, I yell, "Objection,"

11:51.745 --> 11:53.344
and I pick one of these
randomly and say it.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.713
I wouldn't do it at random.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.314
Yeah, and maybe
don't yell... at all.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.750
Maybe just pick one of those
that fits the situation.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.252
I like that.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.721
That works, pick one...

12:02.723 --> 12:04.989
that fits...

12:04.991 --> 12:07.826
and say it.

12:07.828 --> 12:08.893
Todd?

12:08.895 --> 12:09.894
It's down there.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.029
What happens with that?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.097
He gives it to you,
you write it down,

12:12.099 --> 12:13.098
and then what do you do with it?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.165
Whatever I want.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.166
Write that down.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.448
It's already there.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.506
Mr. Sanderson,
how are you today?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.941
I'm fine. Mr. Sanderson,

12:22.943 --> 12:25.110
do you recall
representing my client?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.911
Objection! Hearsay.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.180
Overruled, that doesn't make...

12:29.182 --> 12:30.181
Leading! Nope.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.683
Irrelevant? (Laughter)

12:31.685 --> 12:33.184
It's very relevant.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.352
I think I'm gonna have
to allow this one.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.420
The witness will answer.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.888
Let the record reflect

12:36.890 --> 12:38.223
that everybody laughed
at The Grinder.

12:38.225 --> 12:41.025
Mr. Sanderson, do you recall

12:41.027 --> 12:43.261
receiving a plea deal
from the district attorney?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.395
Objection!

12:44.397 --> 12:45.396
Uh...

12:45.398 --> 12:47.098
Privilege. What?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.967
(whispering): Privilege.
His brother's helping him!

12:48.969 --> 12:50.435
(whispering): Privilege.
Look, they're all helping him.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.470
Privileged.
That works. Sustained.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.372
Okay, Your Honor, you can't just

12:54.374 --> 12:56.574
let him cycle through objections
and get help from the crowd

12:56.576 --> 12:57.976
until he finds one that works.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.911
Okay, he's right, Mr. Sanderson.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.547
I'm afraid you can no longer
guess or get help from people.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.481
I understand, Your Honor.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.449
Proceed, Mr. Velance.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.117
Mr. Sanderson,

13:06.119 --> 13:08.920
did you or did you not
recently participate

13:08.922 --> 13:10.488
in focus group tests?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.123
How does he know about that?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.625
Don't worry about it.
He has no proof.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.461
Your Honor,
I'd like to submit exhibit A.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.996
The transcript

13:17.998 --> 13:19.998
from the Sanderson & Yao
focus group test.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.232
Sounds like proof to me.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.834
And isn't it true, sir,

13:22.836 --> 13:24.269
that in this transcript,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.437
you yourself admit your failure

13:26.439 --> 13:29.941
in bringing this plea deal
to my client, thereby violating

13:29.943 --> 13:32.410
his constitutional right
to a fair trial?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.512
I got him a great deal.
You lied to him!

13:34.514 --> 13:35.914
I didn't lie to him.
Yes, you did.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.249
Did not.
You took the easy way out!

13:38.251 --> 13:39.350
There is no easy way.
He trusted you

13:39.352 --> 13:40.819
and you lied to him,

13:40.821 --> 13:41.920
isn't that true, sir?!

13:41.922 --> 13:43.021
Yeah, it's true!

13:43.023 --> 13:44.022
So what if it is?!

13:44.024 --> 13:46.324
(gallery murmuring)

13:53.433 --> 13:55.033
Open it.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.537
"You've been Velanced."

13:59.539 --> 14:01.339
(gallery gasping)
What does that mean?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.175
It's his last name.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.179
He turned it into a verb.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.216
Damn right I did.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.624
I really screwed everything up
for you, didn't I?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.292
You mean generally

14:21.294 --> 14:22.460
or just this case specifically?
(sighs)

14:22.462 --> 14:23.628
Does it matter?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.197
Uh, no, I guess it doesn't.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.000
Because it's both, right?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.568
Dean, you did the best
that you could.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.870
Well, my best isn't gonna

14:31.872 --> 14:34.038
keep our father out of prison.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.374
You know that prison is not
an option here, right?

14:36.376 --> 14:40.078
And neither is winning, Stewart,
or do you not see that yet?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.312
LEONARD: Oh, it breaks my heart

14:41.314 --> 14:42.714
to see you two fight like this.

14:45.051 --> 14:49.153
Well, I think you get off on it.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.388
I was being disingenuous.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.589
I thought that was clear.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.926
Well, it wasn't.
Well, it was to me,

14:54.928 --> 14:57.929
and it was to
your little buddy here.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.030
Mr. Velance, what is this?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.498
Why-why are you doing this?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.900
Don't you see?

15:01.902 --> 15:04.402
It all comes full circle.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.571
Thank you!
That's what I've been saying.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.939
But he doesn't listen
to you, does he?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.007
He never has.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.508
He doesn't even want you here,

15:10.510 --> 15:12.944
and deep down, you know that.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.212
Don't listen to him, Dean.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.180
He's just trying to drive
a wedge between us.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.516
Or is he calling it
like he sees it?

15:18.518 --> 15:19.584
LEONARD: You think he wants you

15:19.586 --> 15:21.052
as first chair?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.354
I don't. I-I've said
that the whole time.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.857
He doesn't even think
you're a real lawyer.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.292
Again, nothing I've ever denied.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.260
Stop it! I can't stop!

15:29.262 --> 15:30.929
I wish I could stop!

15:30.931 --> 15:32.263
You ruined my life!

15:32.265 --> 15:33.898
I lost my job!

15:33.900 --> 15:35.400
I lost my family!

15:35.402 --> 15:38.036
Do you know how humiliating
it is to lose

15:38.038 --> 15:42.206
a $600 eviction case
to a B-list television lawyer?!

15:42.208 --> 15:43.207
B-list?!

15:43.209 --> 15:44.409
But why hide it?
I mean, why not just

15:44.411 --> 15:45.643
represent him
from the beginning?

15:45.645 --> 15:48.046
I tried to beat you
with the law,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.981
but you beat me with drama.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.549
Now you will learn

15:51.551 --> 15:54.319
what that feels like.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.122
REPORTER: <i>Sanderson started out</i>

15:58.124 --> 15:59.590
as a TV lawyer and made

15:59.592 --> 16:01.125
his transition into real law

16:01.127 --> 16:02.994
late last year. Real law?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.462
No, no, no. Honey,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.731
they said
he transitioned to real law.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.966
Stewart, shh,
turn it off, honey.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.567
Okay, okay.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.436
DEAN SR.: It was your Dad's id...
This isn't it.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.471
Honey, did you
steal the kids' recorder?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.505
I really need to know
what's on this tape,

16:14.507 --> 16:15.506
and if you're
uncomfortable with that,

16:15.508 --> 16:16.941
you should leave the room.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.609
ETHAN:
State your name for the record.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.244
CORY:
It's, uh, Ror... Cory Manler.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.412
(tape fast-forwarding)
Oh, this isn't me.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.413
Wait, no, no, no,
wait, wait, hon.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.581
Play that back for a second.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.515
Look, if Ethan wakes up,
he's gonna freak out

16:24.517 --> 16:25.516
that I took his...
Wait, hold on.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.185
Let me just... I know, hold on.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.186
(tape re-winding)

16:28.188 --> 16:30.355
CORY:
It's, uh, Ror... Cory Manler.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.156
I got to go. You have to go now?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.491
Yeah, I got to go to the office.
Why?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.360
I think we may have missed something.
In the case?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.195
Yeah, if I'm not back
by morning, just tell Dean...

16:37.197 --> 16:40.031
(knocking)

16:40.033 --> 16:41.265
Tell Dean what?

16:41.267 --> 16:43.167
How do you do that?
Where you going?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.003
Okay, I'm gonna let
you two work this out.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.237
I think I found something.

16:46.973 --> 16:47.939
I got an instinct.

16:47.941 --> 16:48.940
Ah, you ready

16:48.942 --> 16:50.274
to let me in on it?

16:50.276 --> 16:51.943
No, no, not yet.
Not till I know it's real.

16:51.945 --> 16:54.946
Stew, instincts are
always for real.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.381
Now go chase that down.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.182
Oh, Dean,

16:58.184 --> 16:59.617
if I'm late for court
tomorrow just stall.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.387
Oh... Stew.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.323
I don't think I need to tell you
there's a lot riding on this.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.991
Yeah, I know, that's why I want to, I
want to go. Oh, no, no, no. You got it.

17:06.993 --> 17:07.959
I want to go to do the thing.
Right, yeah, no.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.241
You got it.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.165
Mr. Manler,

17:14.167 --> 17:17.468
are you a Boise resident?

17:17.470 --> 17:20.638
Uh, yeah.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.173
Mm-hmm. Uh, city limits?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.408
Born and raised?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.690
Yeah.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.477
I like the hat.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.812
It's a very jaunty angle.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.213
Is that a personal choice

17:29.215 --> 17:30.248
or did it come that way?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.849
Uh, oh, I do it myself.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.152
Objection, where is this going?

17:34.154 --> 17:35.586
Excuse me, Your Honor,
"where is this going"

17:35.588 --> 17:37.422
is not on the list
of objections.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.724
Mr. Sanderson, I am going to
need you to arrive at a point.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.392
(Dean clears throat)

17:45.532 --> 17:48.766
Your Honor, I call Stewart
Sanderson to the stand.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.401
Mr. Sanderson,

17:50.403 --> 17:53.838
opposing counsel
would have all of us believe

17:53.840 --> 17:55.106
that this case is in the bag.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.008
That it's over. Is it true?

17:57.010 --> 18:01.179
Have we, in fact, been Valenced?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.380
Vah-lanced. Whatever.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.514
No.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.515
(gallery murmuring)

18:04.517 --> 18:06.050
Then give me one reason

18:06.052 --> 18:07.552
why I shouldn't have to tell

18:07.554 --> 18:10.588
our father that he will
never practice law again.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.357
Give me one reason why we should

18:13.359 --> 18:16.360
not have to shut the doors
of Sanderson & Yao!

18:16.362 --> 18:18.362
Because that man...

18:18.364 --> 18:22.100
is not Cory Manler.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.134
(gallery gasping)

18:23.136 --> 18:24.268
I'm sorry?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.837
(gallery murmuring)

18:27.240 --> 18:28.439
That is.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.807
(gallery gasping)

18:29.809 --> 18:31.542
What?!

18:31.544 --> 18:33.077
Holy... There's two of them.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.212
What is happening?!

18:34.214 --> 18:35.813
I am wondering that myself.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.081
I think we all are, Your Honor.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.117
Counselor, please enlighten us.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.753
That's his twin brother...
Rory Manler.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.455
Come on! Twins?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.556
Really?

18:45.558 --> 18:46.824
This is my life right now.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.226
Well, that's pretty dramatic.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.227
It's...

18:49.229 --> 18:51.562
the most...

18:51.564 --> 18:52.697
dramatic.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.167
Wouldn't you say, counselor?

19:00.406 --> 19:03.808
Mr. Velance, I wouldn't mind
an answer on that.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.210
It was brilliant.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.681
Your Honor,
motion to dismiss all charges.

19:10.683 --> 19:14.152
Yeah, given that
the twin brother was posing

19:14.154 --> 19:16.254
as the other brother
the entire time...

19:16.256 --> 19:18.789
yep, that's fraud.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.158
Motion granted.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.727
(cheering and applause)

19:25.765 --> 19:27.198
(sarcastically): Yay.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.138
You got me off, son,
just like you said you would.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.608
No, Dad,<i> we</i> got you off...

19:37.610 --> 19:39.177
together.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.481
Look at you, grinding.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.116
It was good, right?

19:45.118 --> 19:46.484
Come in at the last second
with the guy, it was...

19:46.486 --> 19:47.785
Just like I would've.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.389
How did you know?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.291
You were right, Dean.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.027
I... I went with my instinct.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.862
I would have gone
with twinstinct

19:57.864 --> 19:58.863
just then. Right.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.897
And you were so close to it.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.065
You didn't-you didn't feel that?

20:01.067 --> 20:02.533
I didn't, but it's good.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.636
Well, that's why
we make a great team.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.872
Oh.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.006
For justice!

20:09.008 --> 20:11.909
(cheering)

20:19.419 --> 20:20.518
But in the end,

20:20.520 --> 20:21.519
it was another

20:21.521 --> 20:22.987
classic Grinder win.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.355
With all the odds against him,

20:24.357 --> 20:25.556
and no one left

20:25.558 --> 20:27.758
in his corner, he still managed

20:27.760 --> 20:28.826
to pull it off

20:28.828 --> 20:30.328
in stunning, dramatic

20:30.330 --> 20:31.829
fashion.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.331
So well told, you guys.
That was nice, buddy.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.565
Yeah, really great.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.566
I think you left out

20:35.568 --> 20:37.001
a couple of, uh, key bits,

20:37.003 --> 20:38.903
but overall I think it was terrific.
Like what?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.606
Well, uh, I don't know, Dad, uh,
maybe the part where I stayed

20:41.608 --> 20:43.874
at the office all night long,
found the twin, convinced him

20:43.876 --> 20:45.409
to testify, brought him
in at the last second

20:45.411 --> 20:47.011
and kind of saved... Oh, right.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.613
Either way, it's a great story.
DEBBIE: Yeah,

20:48.615 --> 20:49.680
and, you know, I appreciate

20:49.682 --> 20:50.748
you guys leaving
out the stuff...

20:50.750 --> 20:51.882
That was in the tape you stole?

20:51.884 --> 20:53.251
Okay, didn't steal it.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.518
It's okay, Mom.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.953
Well, we weren't
gonna use it, anyway.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.355
You think we had
the real estate for that?

20:57.357 --> 20:58.422
Guys, I'm proud of you.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.890
You saved the firm
from going under

20:59.892 --> 21:03.027
when a lot of people
didn't think you could.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.562
And we did it our way, right?

21:04.564 --> 21:06.964
I mean,
it's an unusual approach,

21:06.966 --> 21:08.699
this tag-team thing we got.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.600
Yes, it is.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.635
I'm sure it threw

21:10.637 --> 21:11.802
a lot of people at first.

21:11.804 --> 21:12.770
How're they gonna
make this work?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.038
How're they gonna keep that up?

21:14.040 --> 21:15.873
I heard a lot of that.
Well, we...

21:15.875 --> 21:16.974
showed them.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.975
Yeah, we did,

21:17.977 --> 21:19.910
and it all came full circle.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.747
We thought it was
about me learning from you,

21:22.749 --> 21:28.319
but in the end, it was really
about you learning from me.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.820
Kind of. I don't know if

21:29.822 --> 21:30.921
that's exactly right. Well...

21:30.923 --> 21:32.423
And it's just the beginning,

21:32.425 --> 21:35.826
because now we know
that this works.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.295
This has legs.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.133
