WEBVTT

00:03.347 --> 00:04.677
I knew you weren't getting
anywhere with Ricky.

00:04.712 --> 00:07.179
Maybe that kiss was all I wanted
out of the relationship anyway.

00:07.214 --> 00:08.647
Maybe, but I doubt it.

00:08.681 --> 00:10.381
I need you to get Grant to call me.

00:10.416 --> 00:12.049
I don't want you using my cousin.

00:12.084 --> 00:14.885
He wants a serious relationship.
He wants a girlfriend.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.120
I need a guy like that.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.187
Did you talk to Ruben?

00:17.222 --> 00:18.722
He asked me to talk to Adrian

00:18.756 --> 00:20.657
because I asked him to help my mother.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.959
You actually want me to marry Ben.

00:24.695 --> 00:25.661
Who's that?

00:25.695 --> 00:27.229
That's my husband.

00:27.263 --> 00:28.230
This is Peter.

00:28.264 --> 00:29.464
Nice to meet you.

00:34.936 --> 00:37.905
Maybe you should start a business
of your own. I would love to.

00:37.939 --> 00:40.475
I'd love to stay home and keep house
and cook and take care of the kids.

00:40.509 --> 00:41.643
Promise not to tell?

00:41.677 --> 00:43.242
Promise not to tell what?

00:43.277 --> 00:44.977
That I'm giving up the French horn.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.244
It was really nice meeting you.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.846
Yeah. It was nice meeting you, too.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.146
I hope I get to see you again.

00:49.181 --> 00:50.548
Give me a call.

00:50.582 --> 00:52.216
Don't worry. I don't
wanna get married either.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.884
I just don't want you with Ricky.

00:53.918 --> 00:56.519
Sorry, but...

00:57.521 --> 00:59.289
I might still love Ricky.

01:16.707 --> 01:18.541
So, everyone's going to the park

01:18.575 --> 01:20.577
to celebrate the last
day of school! Yeah!

01:20.611 --> 01:22.577
I don't feel like celebrating.

01:22.611 --> 01:25.177
I still haven't heard from
Amy. How's the wife and kid?

01:25.211 --> 01:27.746
Shut up.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.048
Come on. Amy will call you. Someday.

01:30.082 --> 01:33.017
Go. Go to the park. Go somewhere else.

01:33.051 --> 01:36.720
Just get away from me with
all your joy and sarcasm.

01:36.755 --> 01:38.789
And leave you all alone
on the last day of school?

01:38.823 --> 01:40.757
It's no big deal. I'll
probably just go home.

01:40.791 --> 01:41.791
And cry.

01:41.826 --> 01:43.192
Hank.

01:43.226 --> 01:44.860
It's the last day of school.

01:44.895 --> 01:47.729
I can't help it if I'm in
a good mood and he's not.

01:47.764 --> 01:49.397
What are you gonna do at home?

01:49.432 --> 01:51.699
You can't just sit there and
wait for Amy to call you back.

01:51.733 --> 01:53.801
Why can't I? Because.

01:53.835 --> 01:56.236
Maybe she's not going to call you back.

01:56.271 --> 01:57.805
Not anytime soon anyway.

01:57.839 --> 01:59.240
She has to call me back.

01:59.274 --> 02:00.975
At some point, she has to call me back.

02:01.009 --> 02:04.478
And at this point, it's not
soon at all. It's way past soon.

02:04.512 --> 02:06.413
I mean, we're into eternity.

02:06.447 --> 02:09.816
It's been an eternity.

02:09.850 --> 02:10.949
For all of us.

02:10.984 --> 02:12.918
I'm trying.

02:14.487 --> 02:16.221
Try harder.

02:17.523 --> 02:19.824
Nice.

02:21.293 --> 02:23.928
<i>Adios, amigos.</i>

02:28.199 --> 02:30.100
Oh, I think the baby
should be bilingual.

02:30.134 --> 02:31.634
But we should start with Spanish.

02:31.669 --> 02:33.169
Nobody in my house speaks Spanish.

02:33.203 --> 02:36.305
Everyone in your house speaks
Spanish, except you and your dad.

02:36.339 --> 02:38.073
And Betty.

02:38.107 --> 02:39.474
Betty speaks Spanish?

02:39.509 --> 02:40.608
<i>SÃƒÂ­.</i>

02:41.777 --> 02:43.110
Oh, here. Leme help you with t

02:44.880 --> 02:45.847
Hey.

02:45.881 --> 02:47.948
What?

02:47.983 --> 02:50.751
Ben, nothing would make me
happier than for you to be happy,

02:50.786 --> 02:52.253
but that's not gonna happen with her.

02:52.287 --> 02:54.588
It might. It still might.

02:54.623 --> 02:57.091
I mean, she's talking to you.
She's gotta talk to me eventually.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.260
Yeah, but when she does talk to you,

02:59.294 --> 03:01.128
she could say something
you don't wanna hear.

03:01.163 --> 03:03.130
Like?

03:03.165 --> 03:05.433
Like she doesn't wanna see you anymore

03:05.467 --> 03:08.468
because you're having
a baby with me, and...

03:08.503 --> 03:10.769
Come on, Ben. That's understandable.

03:10.804 --> 03:12.604
Is it?

03:12.638 --> 03:15.006
You and Ricky are friends.
You and Amy are friends.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.941
Amy and Ricky are friends. How'd I
get to be the odd man out with Amy?

03:17.976 --> 03:19.709
I don't know.

03:19.744 --> 03:22.778
Maybe because she loved you more
than she ever loved Ricky or me.

03:22.812 --> 03:24.779
Maybe it's just easier for her
to be friends with Ricky and me.

03:24.814 --> 03:27.782
But, I mean, I was her
friend when she was pregnant.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.784
Why can't she be my
friend when I'm pregnant?

03:29.818 --> 03:30.817
I'm pregnant.

03:30.852 --> 03:31.885
We're pregnant.

03:31.919 --> 03:34.689
Are we? What's pregnant about you?

03:34.723 --> 03:38.458
I don't know, but... I mean, I offered
to marry her when she was pregnant.

03:38.492 --> 03:40.692
My father offered to marry my mother,

03:40.726 --> 03:43.494
and it took her 17 years
before she said yes.

03:43.528 --> 03:45.528
Because no one wants just an offer.

03:45.563 --> 03:46.630
I do.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.334
Hey, Ricky, come here. I
need some help helping Ben.

03:51.368 --> 03:53.335
Soy, but I'm not talking to him,

03:53.369 --> 03:55.737
because all he ever talks
about is Amy not talking to him,

03:55.771 --> 03:58.506
and I've r out of things to say to him.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.841
Bye. Great.

04:00.876 --> 04:03.144
So neither of you are
sympathetic with me.

04:03.179 --> 04:05.580
That's really nice. Really, ally nice.

04:05.614 --> 04:08.249
We were sympathetic
with you upo a point.

04:08.283 --> 04:10.317
What point? This point, okay?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.252
Look, I'm the one who's pregnant.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.254
And this baby isn't just
interfering with your life,

04:14.288 --> 04:15.655
it's interfering with
my life, all right?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.456
And that's supposed mean what?

04:17.491 --> 04:18.958
That if I hadn't gotten you pregnant,

04:18.992 --> 04:20.559
you'd still have a shot at Ricky?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.527
Yeah, I would.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.697
For now, we're friends.
Ricky and I are friends.

04:25.731 --> 04:28.265
And? And you're not friends with Amy.

04:28.299 --> 04:31.868
You have to be friends first if you're
ever gonna be in a real relationship.

04:31.903 --> 04:33.369
Oh. I get it.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.137
So you're still trying to be with Ricky,

04:35.172 --> 04:37.573
but you don't think
that I can be with Amy.

04:37.607 --> 04:39.574
I wanna marry Amy.

04:39.608 --> 04:41.776
You think Ricky's ever
gonna wanna marry you?

04:41.810 --> 04:43.845
I seriously doubt that.

04:46.281 --> 04:48.315
I mean, I seriously doubt
that Ricky's gon wanna

04:48.350 --> 04:50.350
marry you or anyone else.

04:56.257 --> 04:57.957
We have an OB-GYN appointment tomorrow.

04:57.992 --> 04:59.759
It's the first sonogram. won't be able

04:59.793 --> 05:02.528
to find out the sex of the baby,
but we will be able to see a picture.

05:02.562 --> 05:04.029
If you're interested, you can come.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000

<i>e still gonna workORTABLE.
NO CLEANING. NO HASSLE.</i>

05:40.866 --> 05:42.934
at the usual time, right,
now that school is out?

05:42.968 --> 05:45.736
You'll be starting earlier, but you're
still gonna pick John up at the usual time?

05:45.770 --> 05:49.072
Yes, I'm still gonna pick
John up at the usual time.

05:49.107 --> 05:51.274
I don't have to go to work
today or even this weekend.

05:51.308 --> 05:54.777
Bunny told Ben and me we could have the
weekend off before we start summer hours.

05:54.811 --> 05:55.845
That was nice.

05:55.879 --> 05:57.412
Yeah, it was.

05:57.447 --> 05:58.914
So, what are you doing?

05:58.948 --> 06:00.849
We're playing in Central Park tonight.

06:00.883 --> 06:02.917
A lot of people in the park
for the Shakespeare festival.

06:02.951 --> 06:04.385
It sounds as if you've
been doing nothing

06:04.419 --> 06:05.853
but playing the whole
time you've been there.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.954
Playing as in I'm playing in a quartet.

06:07.989 --> 06:09.790
We're one of three quartets
scheduled to play tonight.

06:09.824 --> 06:12.058
Oh. I thought Ashley said
you were giving that up.

06:12.092 --> 06:14.427
No, I'm not giving up
the French horn entirely.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.761
I still wanna play for enjoyment.

06:15.796 --> 06:17.096
I just don't think the French horn

06:17.130 --> 06:18.464
is gonna be my career, that's all.

06:18.498 --> 06:21.033
<i>Oh, and what is? I don't know.</i>

06:21.067 --> 06:23.201
Why do you sound so snotty?

06:23.235 --> 06:25.003
Do I? Yeah.

06:25.037 --> 06:26.771
'Cause maybe I'm tired.

06:26.805 --> 06:28.305
I got upETn. with JohC

06:28.340 --> 06:30.174
Oh.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.543
I see. Tired, huh? I know that feeling.

06:33.578 --> 06:37.947
Yeah. I know you do.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.448
You know how much longer I'm here.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.683
I'm here for two more weeks.

06:41.717 --> 06:45.620
Although, I think I maybe wanna stay

06:45.654 --> 06:47.554
a day or two extra at
the end of the program.

06:47.589 --> 06:49.356
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:49.390 --> 06:51.925
When four weeks is up,
four weeks is up, okay?

06:51.959 --> 06:54.727
John's doing okay. But stay extra days,

06:54.762 --> 06:56.896
extra time away from him?

06:56.930 --> 06:58.964
I know, I know. I miss him.

06:58.998 --> 07:01.532
I really miss him, and I'm
really anxious to get home to him.

07:01.566 --> 07:03.533
But they say we can keep the apartments

07:03.568 --> 07:06.035
for a few days extra if we
want at the end of the program.

07:06.069 --> 07:07.169
Are you kidding?

07:07.203 --> 07:08.370
No. Isn't that nice?

07:08.404 --> 07:10.171
No, it's not nice for you

07:10.206 --> 07:12.974
to take advantage of the situation
and stay longer than you said.

07:13.008 --> 07:14.375
That's not what I'm doing.

07:14.409 --> 07:16.009
Well, what are you doing?

07:16.044 --> 07:19.345
All right. Well, I
wasn't gonna say anything,

07:19.380 --> 07:21.281
but some of the dads are flying in

07:21.315 --> 07:23.249
to be here with the
mothers alone as a couple

07:23.283 --> 07:24.617
at the end of the program.

07:24.651 --> 07:26.618
I think it'd be kind of
awkward for us to do that

07:26.653 --> 07:28.386
since we've never really
been in a relationship,

07:28.421 --> 07:30.054
<i>so I was just gonna stick around</i>

07:30.088 --> 07:32.255
and help babysit and meet
my friends' boyfriends

07:32.290 --> 07:34.758
or partners or...

07:34.792 --> 07:37.159
There goes my phone again.

07:37.194 --> 07:38.761
Why does your phone keep beeping?

07:38.795 --> 07:40.529
Because Ben keeps trying to call me.

07:40.563 --> 07:42.330
Why don't you just talk to him

07:42.365 --> 07:44.232
and tell him that it's over, all right?

07:44.266 --> 07:47.068
Put him out of his misery as
well as everyone around him.

07:47.102 --> 07:49.370
What? Is it over or isn't it?

07:49.404 --> 07:51.071
It's really none of your business.

07:51.105 --> 07:52.606
Yeah, it is. He's starting to bug me.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.040
<i>He's having a baby with Adrian.</i>

07:54.074 --> 07:56.409
He shouldn't even be trying
to get together with you.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.878
You really are tired and cranky.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.747
Yeah, I am. And you know what?

08:00.781 --> 08:03.015
Maybe if Ben hadn't been
trying to get together with you

08:03.050 --> 08:06.217
when we were having a baby,
things might've gone differently,

08:06.252 --> 08:08.552
and maybe I would be flying
in at the end of that program

08:08.587 --> 08:10.053
to be with you in New York.

08:10.088 --> 08:12.055
Differently how?

08:12.089 --> 08:13.991
I don't know.

08:14.025 --> 08:16.293
What chance did we ever
have at a relationship

08:16.327 --> 08:19.262
when he was willing to step
in and come to the rescue?

08:20.398 --> 08:22.366
I guess you're right.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.236
But it doesn't make any difference now.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.604
I'm coming to my own rescue.

08:25.638 --> 08:29.006
Hey, I've been at your
house for two weeks,

08:29.041 --> 08:32.342
and I'm gonna be here another
two weeks taking care of our son.

08:32.376 --> 08:35.611
Don't you think I've come to
your rescue just a little? Huh?

08:35.645 --> 08:38.914
You're right. John is
our son, not just my son.

08:38.948 --> 08:40.416
So you're not rescuing me.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.317
<i>You're just doing your
part as John's dad.</i>

08:42.351 --> 08:43.985
Not that I don't appreciate it,

08:44.019 --> 08:46.154
but that's not coming
to my rescue, all right?

08:46.188 --> 08:49.423
Yeah. All right. You're
not just tired and cranky,

08:49.457 --> 08:50.824
you're-
you're-

08:50.859 --> 08:52.559
I don't know what you are.

08:52.593 --> 08:54.961
I don't know either.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.601
Why the hell did I do that?

09:02.636 --> 09:04.670
Why the hell do I do anything?

09:06.205 --> 09:07.905
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sure the thought

09:07.940 --> 09:10.474
of my staying here a few
extra days is really annoying,

09:10.508 --> 09:12.275
so I just wanna ask
you to think about it.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.277
Just think about it.
That's all I'm asking.

09:14.311 --> 09:17.114
Maybe you could think
about me flying to New York

09:17.148 --> 09:19.816
at the end of the program just
like all the other dads are doing.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.018
Ricky, I told you, those are dads

09:22.052 --> 09:24.020
who are in relationships
with the mothers.

09:24.054 --> 09:27.289
Some of them living together,
some actually even married.

09:27.323 --> 09:29.658
Well, if we're not in a
relationship, what are we?

09:29.692 --> 09:31.459
I don't know.

09:31.494 --> 09:34.263
I think we'll be different things
to each other at different times.

09:34.297 --> 09:37.465
I don't think we really know what we
are right now other than John's parents.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.101
Yeah. Okay.

09:41.135 --> 09:43.336
But I have the weekend.

09:43.371 --> 09:46.339
Why don't I fly to New
York, and we could just talk?

09:46.373 --> 09:49.541
<i>I hate talking over the
phone, and I wanna talk to you.</i>

09:49.575 --> 09:53.044
I'll bring John if you want me
to, but I want to talk to you.

09:53.079 --> 09:56.047
Ricky, you can't fly here and
back in a weekend with John.

09:56.081 --> 09:57.882
He'd be so unhappy on
a plane all that time.

09:57.916 --> 10:00.217
But you're not saying
no to my coming there?

10:00.251 --> 10:02.219
Well...

10:02.253 --> 10:05.288
I mean, we haven't really talked

10:05.322 --> 10:07.390
the way other parents here have talked,

10:07.424 --> 10:09.158
<i>so I guess it could be helpful.</i>

10:09.192 --> 10:11.259
But I wouldn't want you
to leave John with anyone

10:11.294 --> 10:13.261
other than my mom and my dad, and...

10:13.295 --> 10:15.296
This is crazy.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.631
Why is it crazy? I
don't think it's crazy.

10:17.666 --> 10:20.500
I think it's about time we
confronted each other, don't you?

10:22.503 --> 10:24.470
Okay, not confront each other, but...

10:24.505 --> 10:26.873
It's time we talked, Amy.

10:26.907 --> 10:28.407
We need to talk.

10:28.441 --> 10:30.676
We can talk when I get back.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.844
Or we could talk this weekend.

10:32.879 --> 10:36.080
Yeah. Or this weekend.

10:38.416 --> 10:41.551
48 hours basically.
I'd be back in 48 hours.

10:41.586 --> 10:44.254
It's something she needs to do-

10:44.288 --> 10:46.422
we need to do.

10:46.456 --> 10:49.091
Okay, not need, but want.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.092
Okay, not wanna do, but have to do.

10:51.127 --> 10:53.561
We have to do this. And
it would be good for John

10:53.595 --> 10:56.063
if Amy and I did do
this sooner than later.

10:56.098 --> 10:59.266
We should talk to each other
and figure some things out.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.102
I offered to take John,
but Amy doesn't think

11:02.136 --> 11:04.437
that he should be on a
plane that much in two days.

11:04.471 --> 11:07.005
And she'll be home in two weeks.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.007
Although, most of the
other dads are coming in

11:09.041 --> 11:12.777
at the end of the program for a
couple of days without the kids.

11:12.811 --> 11:14.111
But we don't have to do that.

11:14.146 --> 11:17.514
I mean, I wanna do that.

11:17.549 --> 11:20.617
Which is one of the reasons
I wanna do this, but...

11:21.685 --> 11:23.853
Will you watch John, please?

11:25.555 --> 11:28.023
Well, I guess we could.

11:28.058 --> 11:31.193
Couldn't we? Where you gonna stay?

11:31.227 --> 11:34.295
It's New York. I'm sure there are
plenty of hotels I can stay at.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.397
Okay, let's just cut to the chase.

11:36.432 --> 11:39.800
Promise us that you are not going to
have sex with Amy if we do this for you.

11:39.834 --> 11:43.369
Amy and I are definitely not gonna
have sex if you do this for us.

11:43.404 --> 11:44.904
It's for us, not just for me.

11:44.939 --> 11:47.740
Promise. Promise. I'm not
even thinking like that.

11:47.774 --> 11:51.376
Supposedly you weren't thinking like
that at band camp, and it just happened.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.311
I don't wanna hear that
it just happened again.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.679
Of course not.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.247
I would never ask you to keep John

11:56.282 --> 11:58.449
so I can fly to New York to
have sex with your daughter.

11:58.483 --> 12:00.884
I just wanna talk to her,
and she wants to talk to me.

12:00.919 --> 12:02.652
And we need to talk, that's all.

12:02.687 --> 12:04.053
That's all?

12:05.923 --> 12:08.891
Go.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.894
Yeah, go.

12:12.929 --> 12:15.096
Thank you. I really appreciate it,

12:15.130 --> 12:17.098
and I know Amy really appreciates it.

12:17.132 --> 12:19.266
I'm gonna go pick up John.
I'll bring him right home,

12:19.301 --> 12:21.902
and then I'm gonna go.

12:21.936 --> 12:23.436
Go where?

12:23.471 --> 12:25.672
Why don't you go with me to
pick John up from the nursery?

12:25.706 --> 12:28.140
I wanna talk to you.

12:28.175 --> 12:30.843
No, it's okay. I don't
really feel like talking.

12:30.877 --> 12:33.945
Come on, Ashley. I'm asking you
to do this for me as a friend.

12:33.979 --> 12:35.880
Well, I'm not really your friend.

12:35.915 --> 12:38.716
I don't know what you wanna talk
to me about or where you're going,

12:38.750 --> 12:41.618
but since they knew
about it first, forget it.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.823
I don't wanna be late. Come on. Please.

13:03.404 --> 13:05.204
What's all the happiness about?

13:05.239 --> 13:06.839
About making you happy.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.342
There's probably nothing
that's gonna make you happy

13:10.376 --> 13:12.344
when you hear that Ricky's
going away for the weekend.

13:12.378 --> 13:15.313
He's going to see your
sister in New York.

13:15.347 --> 13:18.382
They need to talk. Talking is part of
this program she's doing apparently.

13:18.416 --> 13:20.651
And this would be a problem for me?

13:20.685 --> 13:23.453
Ricky talking to Amy would
be a problem for me because...

13:23.487 --> 13:26.522
I know the way you feel about him. I
know you don't just wanna be friends.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.257
But, Ash-
But, Dad-

13:28.291 --> 13:30.959
I would think it would be more
of a problem for you and Mom

13:30.994 --> 13:33.495
since, obviously, if Ricky
flies all the way to New York,

13:33.529 --> 13:36.164
he and Amy are gonna be doing
a lot more than just talking.

13:36.198 --> 13:38.999
I mean, I would think
that they would have sex.

13:39.033 --> 13:42.802
At least once. Maybe more,
depending on how the talking goes.

13:55.775 --> 13:58.076
Hello?

13:58.110 --> 13:59.877
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

13:59.911 --> 14:02.646
Amy? Amy, is that really you?

14:02.681 --> 14:04.081
Yes, it's really me.

14:04.115 --> 14:06.983
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you for talking to me.

14:07.018 --> 14:10.620
Ben, I thought it was clear when
I didn't return your 57 messages

14:10.654 --> 14:12.822
that I don't really wanna
talk to you right now,

14:12.856 --> 14:14.823
but apparently you can't
accept that I don't really

14:14.858 --> 14:17.159
wanna talk to you right now, so
I'm just calling to let you know

14:17.193 --> 14:20.095
that I will talk to you at some
point, but not over the phone, okay?

14:20.129 --> 14:22.330
<i>When I get back, then
we can talk face-to-face.</i>

14:22.364 --> 14:24.165
Until then, please stop calling me.

14:24.199 --> 14:28.168
So, you will see me and
talk to me when you get back?

14:28.202 --> 14:30.203
Yes, I will. I definitely will.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.704
I'll call you when I'm ready to talk.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.405
When do you think that'll be?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.574
<i>Uh, what day do you get back? What time?</i>

14:35.608 --> 14:37.543
Do you think I can pick
you up from the airport?

14:37.577 --> 14:38.911
I drove you to the airport, remember?

14:38.945 --> 14:40.612
I'll call you when I get back.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.013
A day or two after I get home,

14:42.047 --> 14:44.382
after I've had time to see
John and get settled in,

14:44.416 --> 14:46.450
I'll call you, and we
can get together and talk.

14:46.484 --> 14:48.851
Can we just talk for
a minute now? Please?

14:48.886 --> 14:51.020
I don't have much time. There's
something I have to do tonight.

14:51.054 --> 14:52.888
I just wanna know that there's hope-

14:52.922 --> 14:55.089
<i>that there's some hope</i>

14:55.124 --> 14:57.524
that you and I can
someday beogher again, Amy,

14:57.559 --> 14:59.559
despite what's going
on with Adrian and me.

14:59.593 --> 15:02.061
I don't wanna have this
conversation over the phone.

15:02.095 --> 15:04.696
Well, I can come back there.

15:04.730 --> 15:07.198
Yeah, I could ask my dad
if he minds taking the jet,

15:07.232 --> 15:09.699
and he can fly there again,
and we can talk face-to-face.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.701
No, Ben. I'm sorry, but no.

15:11.735 --> 15:14.237
And I really have to go. And I
really want you to stop calling me.

15:14.271 --> 15:16.272
I'll call you when I'm ready to talk.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.140
That's two more weeks, Amy.

15:18.175 --> 15:20.742
I don't know if I can not
call you for two more weeks.

15:20.777 --> 15:22.511
Then just start with this weekend, okay?

15:22.545 --> 15:25.146
No more phone calls or messages or
anything this weekend, all right?

15:25.180 --> 15:26.847
Okay.

15:26.882 --> 15:30.217
Yeah, I think I can do that
- just not call all weekend.

15:30.251 --> 15:32.319
<i>And I will</i>

15:32.353 --> 15:34.487
look forward to talking
to you face-to-face

15:34.522 --> 15:36.722
whenever you're ready
to talk face-to-face.

15:38.258 --> 15:40.893
Amy?

15:40.927 --> 15:43.795
Was there something else
that you wanted to tell me?

15:44.964 --> 15:47.298
No, I don't think so. Bye, Ben.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.467
Bye, Amy. And thanks for calling.

15:49.501 --> 15:52.602
Well, not calling, but
picking up and talking to me.

15:52.636 --> 15:54.037
You're welcome. Bye.

15:54.071 --> 15:55.638
Bye.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.808
So...

15:58.842 --> 16:01.744
So I just talked to her.

16:01.778 --> 16:03.979
Yeah, I actually just talked to Amy.

16:04.014 --> 16:05.781
Oh, yeah? What'd she say?

16:05.815 --> 16:08.316
She said that she doesn't
wanna talk to me right now.

16:08.351 --> 16:11.019
Well, I said all along
that she'll be angry.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.921
And she'll be angry for
a while, but life goes on.

16:13.955 --> 16:16.256
Yes, it does. She said that she wants

16:16.290 --> 16:18.257
to talk to me face-to-face
when she gets back.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.258
What do you think that
means? Oh, I don't know.

16:20.293 --> 16:22.293
That she'll talk to you
face-to-face when she gets back?

16:22.327 --> 16:24.594
I think that's good. I mean, don't you?

16:24.629 --> 16:27.664
I mean, you could take it as

16:27.698 --> 16:30.034
she wants to see me.

16:30.068 --> 16:32.370
Amy wants to see me. Did she say that?

16:32.404 --> 16:34.306
Or did she say she'll
see you in two weeks?

16:34.340 --> 16:37.241
No, she said she'll talk to me
in two weeks. But face-to-face.

16:37.276 --> 16:39.276
So that's as good as
saying she wants to see me.

16:39.311 --> 16:41.011
Maybe.

16:41.045 --> 16:43.280
Oh, it was so great to hear her voice.

16:43.314 --> 16:45.148
I never thought I'd
hear her voice again.

16:45.182 --> 16:47.551
I mean, I've heard it a thousand
times on the message machine,

16:47.586 --> 16:50.354
but I didn't really think I was
gonna get to hear her voice again.

16:50.388 --> 16:52.189
And now I'm gonna hear it in person.

16:52.223 --> 16:54.190
In two weeks. That's good.

16:54.225 --> 16:56.792
Could be. How's Adrian?

16:56.826 --> 16:59.060
Who? Oh. Yeah.

16:59.095 --> 17:00.562
Uh, Adrian. She's fine.

17:00.596 --> 17:02.930
She's having some sort
of thing done tomorrow.

17:02.965 --> 17:05.098
Uh, we have a doctor's appointment.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.634
What sort of thing? I don't know.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.368
But I told her I'd go with her,

17:09.403 --> 17:11.369
which is proof that
I'm not ignoring her.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.137
I'm just not marrying her.

17:13.173 --> 17:15.674
So if you came in here
to try to pressure me

17:15.708 --> 17:17.342
into a relationship with Adrian,

17:17.376 --> 17:19.042
now would not be a good time to do that.

17:19.077 --> 17:21.545
Because one, I do have a
relationship with Adrian.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.480
It's just not the one that
you and her father want.

17:23.513 --> 17:26.382
And two, I'm still pretty
high on that phone call

17:26.415 --> 17:29.150
in which Amy said that she's gonna
see me in two weeks and talk to me.

17:29.185 --> 17:31.151
That's not what I came in here for-

17:31.186 --> 17:33.420
to pressure you into a
relationship with Adrian.

17:33.454 --> 17:35.855
But you came in here for something.

17:35.890 --> 17:38.091
I came in here to ask you
if you wanted to invite

17:38.126 --> 17:40.493
some of your friends over tonight
for hamburgers or something.

17:40.528 --> 17:42.495
Have a little party. Have some fun.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.963
I mean, where are your friends?
Where's Henry and Alice?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.633
I mean, every year,
when school lets out,

17:47.668 --> 17:50.069
the three of you usually
do something to celebrate.

17:50.104 --> 17:51.871
Why don't you ask them over?

17:51.905 --> 17:55.374
Or ask some other people over.
You need to be with people.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.609
No, I don't. And what other people?

17:57.643 --> 18:00.278
Jack. You could ask Jack over.

18:00.312 --> 18:04.081
Or maybe Tom, since he and
Tom are living together.

18:04.115 --> 18:06.049
And then, I mean,

18:06.084 --> 18:08.384
Grace is in the house
right next to them,

18:08.418 --> 18:11.186
and you might wanna ask her over.

18:11.221 --> 18:14.556
And since she's best friends
with Adrian, she might come.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.024
I mean, if you wanted. No pressure.

18:16.058 --> 18:17.258
Yeah. No pressure.

18:17.293 --> 18:19.059
Ask anyone you want over.

18:19.094 --> 18:20.961
As many people as you want over.

18:20.995 --> 18:23.263
Ask Amy's friends. Uh, uh...

18:23.298 --> 18:26.299
Madison and Lauren,
and her sister, Ashley.

18:26.334 --> 18:28.401
Ashley probably doesn't have
anything to do, does she?

18:28.435 --> 18:32.105
I don't know, and I don't really care.

18:32.139 --> 18:34.807
Unless, of course, I could
enlist her as a supporter,

18:34.841 --> 18:37.109
but I think she's kind of
interested in Ricky right now,

18:37.143 --> 18:39.310
which may or may not be good for me.

18:39.345 --> 18:42.246
Maybe she could come with that guy
that she came to the wedding with.

18:42.281 --> 18:43.948
Uh, Grant, was it?

18:43.982 --> 18:45.916
He just went out with Grace.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.084
So maybe they wanna
see each other again.

18:48.119 --> 18:51.721
Invite him and his cousin, uh, uh
- Griffin, is it?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.656
He's seeing someone, too. Invite her.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.792
It's not a her. Then
him. Invite them all.

18:56.826 --> 18:58.393
Yeah, or none of them at all.

18:58.427 --> 19:01.662
Ben, really, life is
constantly changing,

19:01.697 --> 19:03.931
and you never know who's
gonna wind up with whom.

19:03.965 --> 19:07.634
And you can't just sit around
waiting for Amy to come around.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.069
Maybe she will, and maybe she won't.

19:10.104 --> 19:14.473
Could you just be on my side, okay?

19:14.507 --> 19:17.375
I mean, could you just
be on my side with Amy?

19:17.410 --> 19:20.144
Because everybody else
is turning against me,

19:20.179 --> 19:21.879
and I'm hanging out
there in the universe

19:21.913 --> 19:24.081
hoping for a miracle, and...

19:24.115 --> 19:26.483
I need someone, you know?

19:26.517 --> 19:28.318
I need someone who knows me

19:28.352 --> 19:30.620
and understands me and
knows what I'm going through

19:30.654 --> 19:33.322
and who wants Amy to love me as
much as I want her to love me,

19:33.356 --> 19:36.391
even though I'm having
a baby with Adrian.

19:36.426 --> 19:39.027
And so what, you know?

19:39.061 --> 19:41.095
So what if I'm having
a baby with Adrian.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.596
I still want Amy.

19:42.630 --> 19:45.432
Wanting something really, really badly

19:45.466 --> 19:48.201
doesn't mean you're gonna get that
something or that someone, Ben.

19:48.235 --> 19:51.637
And sometimes, when
you go chasing a dream,

19:51.671 --> 19:55.206
you find that you already had
what you wanted in life already.

19:55.241 --> 19:58.242
Like Adrian and a baby?

19:58.277 --> 20:01.811
I don't want that. I really don't.

20:01.846 --> 20:04.847
And that is not what I
wanted to hear right now.

20:04.882 --> 20:06.415
I know.

20:06.450 --> 20:08.851
I know what you wanted to hear, but...

20:08.885 --> 20:12.320
Henry and Alice are downstairs,

20:13.589 --> 20:16.190
and I think they
already invited everyone.

20:24.302 --> 20:26.069
Yeah, that's where my parents are.

20:26.104 --> 20:28.071
Well, what about us? I'll be back.

20:28.106 --> 20:29.740
Well, then you go to football camp.

20:29.774 --> 20:31.308
I go to football camp every summer.

20:31.342 --> 20:33.610
And it's not a sleepaway
camp, so I'll be home at night.

20:33.645 --> 20:35.546
Not that I'll feel
like going out at night.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.349
And even if you do, you have
a 9:00 curfew from the coach.

20:38.383 --> 20:41.217
But I know you two managed to
find a way around that last summer.

20:41.251 --> 20:42.616
Right.

20:42.651 --> 20:44.683
When do you go off to
that medical school thing?

20:44.717 --> 20:48.987
Med camp? The program's been
shortened by a few weeks. Cost cutting.

20:49.021 --> 20:52.523
Mmm. Cost cutting. Well, I hope they
don't leave out any of the vital organs.

20:52.557 --> 20:54.724
Like the heart?

20:54.759 --> 20:58.027
Or did you mean some
other vital organ? Oh, boy.

20:58.062 --> 21:00.596
So, Jack told you he's going
to Phoenix to visit his parents?

21:01.965 --> 21:05.534
I just love his mother.
Don't you? And his father.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.336
Well, I only met them the one time.

21:08.370 --> 21:09.836
Oh. Oh, yeah.

21:09.871 --> 21:12.273
I've known them for years,
you know, 'cause of church.

21:12.307 --> 21:14.941
Right. Church. I forgot
you went to church.

21:14.976 --> 21:16.944
Yeah, Jack and I both go to church.

21:16.978 --> 21:19.346
Well, Jack and I have something

21:19.381 --> 21:23.083
far greater in common than
belief in a higher power.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.922
Madison...

21:29.956 --> 21:31.623
I hate that you've had sex with her.

21:31.657 --> 21:35.093
Well, I did, and I can't
take it back. It happened.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.862
Well, I wanna do something with you

21:37.896 --> 21:39.430
that you haven't done with her.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.265
We do that all the time.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.500
Well, then, I wanna do something else.

21:44.534 --> 21:45.868
Something else like what?

21:51.107 --> 21:54.776
But we always go to the
family cabin for the summer.

21:54.810 --> 21:56.344
I have to go.

21:56.378 --> 21:58.546
And then you have to come
back and go to football camp.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.447
You have no time for me.

22:00.482 --> 22:02.382
Then I'll make time.

22:03.384 --> 22:05.685
Next week?

22:05.719 --> 22:09.754
Next week, I'll be at the family cabin.

22:09.789 --> 22:12.557
It's like not even having a boyfriend,

22:12.591 --> 22:14.225
having you as a boyfriend.

22:14.259 --> 22:16.226
Well, what do you want me to do?

22:16.261 --> 22:18.929
I don't know.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.231
But I'll think of something.

22:21.265 --> 22:22.598
Great.

22:24.567 --> 22:26.401
Think of something.

22:29.339 --> 22:32.573
Does Peter have to meet you here?
Why couldn't we just pick him up?

22:32.608 --> 22:34.242
I feel like your date.

22:34.276 --> 22:36.377
Peter may be out of the
closet with his family.

22:36.411 --> 22:38.345
That doesn't mean he's
comfortable dating.

22:38.379 --> 22:40.013
I'll do whatever Peter wants to do.

22:40.047 --> 22:43.416
If he wants to come by himself
and meet me here, that's fine.

22:43.450 --> 22:46.784
You have to take these
things slowly, you know?

22:46.819 --> 22:48.953
See you.

22:53.291 --> 22:55.257
Hey! I'm so glad you came.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.594
Good to see you. Good to see you, too.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.763
So, is Jack still living
in the guest house with Tom?

23:00.797 --> 23:01.964
Yep.

23:01.998 --> 23:03.632
That's too bad.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.033
Why?

23:05.068 --> 23:08.003
Because, obviously, you loved
him enough to have sex once,

23:08.037 --> 23:10.304
you probably still love him
enough to have sex again.

23:10.338 --> 23:13.507
And I just got stomped on, and
I'm not up for a second stomping.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.509
You know what I mean?

23:15.543 --> 23:18.311
I know what you mean. Who told you?

23:18.346 --> 23:20.180
Griffin.

23:20.214 --> 23:21.848
Med camp?

23:21.882 --> 23:24.783
Yeah. How'd you know? How'd you know?

23:24.818 --> 23:28.620
I went there. I wanna be a doctor.

23:28.655 --> 23:29.688
No way.

23:29.722 --> 23:31.223
What section were you in?

23:31.257 --> 23:34.325
I'm kind of embarrassed
to say. Obstetrics.

23:34.359 --> 23:37.727
Oh. I was in sports medicine.

23:37.761 --> 23:39.061
Oh, yeah. Jack.

23:39.095 --> 23:41.363
Yeah. But I'm changing
this summer though.

23:41.397 --> 23:42.964
Yeah. Me, too. What's next?

23:42.998 --> 23:44.299
I haven't decided yet.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.768
Wow. Med camp. No kidding.

23:46.802 --> 23:49.170
We were both there, and we
didn't even notice each other.

23:49.204 --> 23:52.239
So, did you sign up for
obstetrics so you could meet girls?

23:52.273 --> 23:56.208
Yeah. And I thought it might somehow
make me sexier for some reason.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.143
You got a real interest
in sports medicine?

23:59.178 --> 24:02.079
Oh, not really.

24:03.281 --> 24:05.081
Not an interest that lasted anyway.

24:05.116 --> 24:06.449
Hey.

24:06.484 --> 24:08.384
Can we talk?

24:08.419 --> 24:10.686
She's all yours... till med camp.

24:14.791 --> 24:16.692
There's no chance I could have company

24:16.726 --> 24:18.627
sleep over at the guest house, is there?

24:18.661 --> 24:21.063
Even if none of us are
gonna be doing anything?

24:24.367 --> 24:27.768
Maybe if I sleep with him he'll
feel closer to me than her.

24:27.802 --> 24:30.870
I mean, he's had sex with Grace,
but he hasn't slept with her.

24:30.904 --> 24:34.339
And sleeping with somebody
can be a really intimate thing.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.307
Hey, maybe you guys
could sleep over, too.

24:36.341 --> 24:37.841
They've got bunk beds.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.278
Yeah. I could say I'm spending
the night at your house,

24:40.312 --> 24:42.314
you could say you're spending
the night at my house,

24:42.349 --> 24:44.351
and we could just spend the
night at Grace's guest house.

24:44.386 --> 24:47.621
God, I hate that he lives
in Grace's guest house.

24:51.124 --> 24:54.293
Hey, Ashley. How are you?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.361
I was afraid you might be here.

24:56.396 --> 24:57.996
Hi. Hi.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.565
So how's Grace?

25:00.599 --> 25:03.134
Interesting. We just found
out we both wanna be doctors.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.936
Since when do you wanna be a doctor?

25:04.970 --> 25:08.372
Since always. You Adrian?

25:08.406 --> 25:10.040
Yeah. Hi.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.942
Heard about the baby.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.044
Yeah?

25:13.078 --> 25:14.545
Maybe I shouldn't have said that-

25:14.579 --> 25:15.913
that I heard about the baby.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.415
I just felt I should say it.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.884
I studied obstetrics, just at med camp.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.220
Really? You know about babies?

25:22.254 --> 25:25.290
Just what they tell 16-year-olds
who think they wanna deliver babies.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.258
Do I know you? Grant.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.594
Oh, yeah.

25:29.628 --> 25:32.230
You're Grant. Huh.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.765
Huh?

25:33.799 --> 25:36.067
Yeah. Huh.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.336
I'm Grace's best friend, you know.

25:38.371 --> 25:39.337
I know.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.007
Is it me, or is it boring in here?

25:43.142 --> 25:45.310
I'll let you two talk.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.448
Griffin's meeting Peter here.

25:49.482 --> 25:51.783
You're not angry at something, are you?

25:51.817 --> 25:54.418
No. Not at you anyway.

25:55.653 --> 25:57.554
My dad made me come here.

25:57.588 --> 25:59.522
I hate parties.

26:01.157 --> 26:03.158
I'm no good at parties.

26:06.261 --> 26:08.596
I don't think Ben is enjoying the party.

26:08.630 --> 26:11.365
It's early. He's still angry
with us. He'll come around.

26:11.399 --> 26:13.935
I hope so. I can't take him being
like this for the next couple months.

26:13.969 --> 26:17.004
Couple months? You mean the
next nine months to 18 years.

26:17.039 --> 26:20.007
Oh, right. The baby. I
just meant the summer.

26:20.042 --> 26:21.876
Yeah. Summer's come and go.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.911
Babies stay around a lifetime.

26:23.946 --> 26:25.947
I think Benjamin Boykewich
is going to have to

26:25.981 --> 26:28.449
get over his spoiled self and grow up.

26:28.483 --> 26:29.876
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:37.192 --> 26:39.893
So, who's the Sausage King's heir?

26:39.927 --> 26:42.395
I don't know. I, um-

26:42.430 --> 26:45.264
I don't know any of these
people really, except, uh...

26:45.299 --> 26:47.132
Hi, Griffin.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.067
Griffin, Hayley. Haley, Griffin.

26:49.101 --> 26:50.068
Nice to meet you.

26:50.102 --> 26:51.736
Are you a Boykewich?

26:51.770 --> 26:55.572
No. Uh, that guy right there
- that's Ben.

26:56.707 --> 26:58.174
Hey, Griffin.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.109
So, look who's speaking to me.

27:00.143 --> 27:01.777
Oh, don't be a jerk, all right?

27:01.812 --> 27:04.813
All right. This is
Peter and his... date-

27:05.948 --> 27:07.715
date Hayley.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.750
Come on, Hayley. I'll show
you where the drinks are.

27:09.785 --> 27:11.852
You can thank me later.

27:11.887 --> 27:14.889
So, do you actually know Ben Boykewich?

27:14.923 --> 27:16.958
Could you introduce us? Why, yes.

27:16.993 --> 27:19.294
I could also introduce you to
the girl he's having a baby with.

27:19.329 --> 27:20.862
She's really nice.

27:20.897 --> 27:24.165
Why are all the really good
guys having babies these days?

27:27.202 --> 27:29.603
So, surprise.

27:29.638 --> 27:31.772
I'm just not ready, all right?

27:31.806 --> 27:34.740
I wanted to see you again,
but I'm just not ready.

27:34.774 --> 27:37.075
Hey, ready or not, you're gay.

27:37.109 --> 27:39.910
Yeah, well, I'm gay when I wanna be gay.

27:39.944 --> 27:42.511
Well, you're gay whether
you want to be gay or not.

27:42.545 --> 27:44.279
And I'm usually more
sympathetic with guys

27:44.314 --> 27:47.615
who are having a difficult time
coming out to friends and family,

27:47.649 --> 27:49.550
but you are out.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.918
You came out. You can't go back in.

27:51.953 --> 27:55.087
Yeah, I can. I can if I want.

27:55.122 --> 27:58.022
You don't want or you wouldn't be here.

27:58.057 --> 28:00.090
And does Hayley know that you're gay?

28:00.125 --> 28:02.960
No, and you're not gonna tell her.

28:04.228 --> 28:07.097
Yeah. All right. Fine. Whatever.

28:07.131 --> 28:08.398
Sorry.

28:08.432 --> 28:09.866
No, you're not.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.134
No, I'm really not.

28:14.169 --> 28:15.636
Hmm...

28:15.670 --> 28:18.339
So I think it's a good thing.
I mean, she made it a point

28:18.373 --> 28:21.107
to pick up the phone and tell me
herself that she wants to talk to me

28:21.142 --> 28:23.842
in two weeks when she gets home, and
that she wants to talk to me face-to-face.

28:23.876 --> 28:27.411
So, obviously, she wants
to see me face-to-face.

28:27.445 --> 28:29.779
So she wants to see me.
I think it's a good thing.

28:29.813 --> 28:32.414
Really? You think so?

28:32.448 --> 28:37.183
Tammy said she want to see me.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.151
And I didn't wanna see her.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.885
Yeah, but I do wanna see Amy.

28:41.919 --> 28:46.655
Maybe she had bad news
- tell you.

28:46.690 --> 28:50.258
And that's why Tammy wanna see me.

28:50.293 --> 28:53.995
And Tammy tell me she
was getting married.

28:54.029 --> 28:57.464
I don't think Amy wants to
tell me something like that.

28:59.232 --> 29:02.634
Ben, this is Hayley. Hayley,
this is Ben Boykewich.

29:03.669 --> 29:05.070
Hey, Ben Boykewich.

29:05.104 --> 29:07.938
No offense, but I'm not interested.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.608
What's wrong with you?

29:12.642 --> 29:14.176
What is wrong with me

29:14.210 --> 29:15.977
is that the only girl
I'm interested in is Amy.

29:16.011 --> 29:17.711
Well, I've got news for you.

29:17.746 --> 29:19.913
Ricky's flying to New York
to see Amy this weekend.

29:19.947 --> 29:22.180
Ricky's flying to New York
to see Amy this weekend?

29:22.215 --> 29:24.482
Uh-oh. What?

29:27.682 --> 29:30.714
I'm really not good at parties.

29:36.657 --> 29:38.291
Ricky?

29:38.325 --> 29:40.226
<i>Yeah, it's me. Come on up.</i>

29:56.840 --> 30:00.776
So, uh, welcome to New York. Come on in.

30:03.113 --> 30:05.682
It's nice. Yeah. Isn't it?

30:06.951 --> 30:09.486
It is. So, how was your flight?

30:09.521 --> 30:11.688
It was good. I slept the whole way.

30:11.723 --> 30:14.458
Oh, so you're not tired? I'm not tired.

30:14.492 --> 30:16.459
Still, we should probably
walk over to your hotel.

30:16.494 --> 30:19.128
Or I could do that alone.

30:19.163 --> 30:22.396
I could walk over to the hotel,
clean up, come back in an hour or two.

30:22.430 --> 30:24.331
Yeah, we could get some breakfast.

30:24.365 --> 30:26.800
I always eat breakfast at this
cute little place around the corner.

30:26.834 --> 30:29.535
All the girls do. Well, all
the girls in the program.

30:29.569 --> 30:32.570
They call us the "Little Mothers"
- all the guys who work there.

30:34.272 --> 30:36.673
Or, you know, you could just
clean up and shower here.

30:36.707 --> 30:38.374
I have a really nice
shower and a bathtub.

30:38.408 --> 30:40.208
I could do that, I guess.

30:40.242 --> 30:43.077
Yeah, that'd probably be
quicker. Yeah, that'd be quicker.

30:43.111 --> 30:44.711
And then I'll show you New York.

30:44.746 --> 30:47.514
I'm not really here to see New York.

30:47.548 --> 30:49.883
I'm just here to see you, Amy.

30:51.052 --> 30:53.086
Um, I'm kind of hungry. Are you hungry?

30:53.121 --> 30:55.655
I could eat. But after I clean up.

30:55.690 --> 30:58.391
Yeah. After you've cleaned up.

30:58.426 --> 31:01.561
I've missed, uh, John.

31:01.595 --> 31:04.263
And he's missed you. But he's busy.

31:04.297 --> 31:07.232
He's so busy walking around,
getting into everything.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.767
He's really growing up fast.

31:08.801 --> 31:10.436
I hope he's okay without you there.

31:10.471 --> 31:11.504
Oh, he'll be okay.

31:15.109 --> 31:17.076
It's really good to see you, Amy.

31:18.112 --> 31:21.715
You, too, Ricky. You, too.

31:21.750 --> 31:24.018
We're gonna get in trouble
for this anyway, you know?

31:24.052 --> 31:25.386
So what?

31:25.420 --> 31:26.621
"So what"?

31:26.655 --> 31:28.790
I could get kicked out
of here. That's "so what".

31:28.824 --> 31:31.525
Well, I can't go home right
now. It's 4:30 in the morning.

31:31.559 --> 31:33.227
I'm supposed to be at her house.

31:33.261 --> 31:35.929
Yeah. And I'm supposed
to be at her house.

31:35.964 --> 31:37.964
We can't show up at either
house in the middle of the night.

31:37.999 --> 31:41.367
What time do you two usually get up
when you sleep over each other's houses?

31:41.402 --> 31:42.902
Around 11:00.

31:44.071 --> 31:46.038
This really isn't what I had in mind.

31:46.073 --> 31:49.875
You know that? And I don't
mean I had sex in mind.

31:49.910 --> 31:51.944
I did have sleeping with you in mind.

31:51.979 --> 31:54.281
I know that. Stop complaining.

31:54.315 --> 31:56.383
Yeah, stop complaining.
We all know that.

31:56.417 --> 31:59.553
We all thought we were gonna
sleep in the same beds together.

31:59.587 --> 32:00.720
We still could.

32:00.755 --> 32:03.390
No. I say no.

32:07.961 --> 32:10.797
I have to go. I'm in so much
trouble it's not even funny.

32:10.832 --> 32:12.967
Mmm. It's kind of funny.

32:13.001 --> 32:14.635
Yeah, kind of.

32:19.208 --> 32:20.676
Good night, Doctor.

32:20.710 --> 32:22.344
Good morning, Doctor.

32:27.150 --> 32:28.484
Bye.

32:33.024 --> 32:34.925
Is it night, or is it morning?

32:34.960 --> 32:37.193
Oh, we were
- we were at a party.

32:38.294 --> 32:40.261
And Grant, um
- That was Grant.

32:40.296 --> 32:42.296
He
- He followed me home

32:42.331 --> 32:44.932
just to make sure I got home safe.

32:44.966 --> 32:47.100
And then, well, you know.

32:47.134 --> 32:49.035
Yeah. I know.

32:49.069 --> 32:51.804
And your mom knows. The whole
neighborhood probably knows.

32:51.838 --> 32:53.839
What? It's not like
we were doing anything.

32:53.874 --> 32:56.108
Look, here's the thing. If
you do decide to do something,

32:56.142 --> 32:57.977
don't do it with a guy
at med camp, all right?

32:58.011 --> 33:00.513
All right. The whole purpose of med camp

33:00.547 --> 33:02.815
is to go, get your mind off guys,

33:02.849 --> 33:05.116
focus on your schoolwork, what
you wanna do with your life.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.186
I have news for you and Mom.

33:07.221 --> 33:09.655
Tonight is what I wanna do with my life.

33:09.690 --> 33:11.790
I wanna stay up until 4 a. m.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.792
and make out with some
guy that I really like,

33:13.827 --> 33:17.062
and talk about life
and laugh until I cry

33:17.097 --> 33:18.864
and cry until I laugh.

33:18.898 --> 33:20.632
All right. Well, I just came down here

33:20.666 --> 33:22.867
to get your mom the last piece
of pie that was left over.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.869
Lock the door and make
sure that you're all right.

33:24.904 --> 33:27.037
I am more than all right.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.506
So Mom is still awake?

33:28.541 --> 33:30.675
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
you guys are a lot alike.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.042
Good night.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.977
Or good morning.

33:38.414 --> 33:40.883
I'm really surprised
you let me sleep over.

33:40.917 --> 33:44.552
You're surprised? I'm shocked.

33:44.586 --> 33:46.820
Who knew my parents
would let you sleep over?

33:46.854 --> 33:49.322
And by the way, who's sleeping?

33:49.356 --> 33:51.357
You've been talking
for two hours straight.

33:51.392 --> 33:53.225
Have I?

33:55.228 --> 33:56.862
Yeah, you have.

33:56.897 --> 33:59.765
I'm just... nervous.

33:59.799 --> 34:00.965
You're nervous?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.667
Yeah. I'm nervous.

34:02.701 --> 34:05.868
I've never really had a boyfriend.

34:06.903 --> 34:08.870
Yeah, but you've had sex.

34:08.904 --> 34:11.071
And I haven't had sex.

34:11.106 --> 34:14.373
We're not gonna have sex until we know each
other better and until I'm comfortable with that.

34:14.408 --> 34:17.243
Yeah. All right. I hear you.

34:18.279 --> 34:21.380
Hey, could you two knock it off?

34:21.449 --> 34:23.417
I'm trying to get some sleep here.

34:23.451 --> 34:26.286
Not that this isn't
really interesting stuff,

34:26.321 --> 34:27.688
but I have to get some sleep.

34:27.722 --> 34:29.556
You better not tell anyone.

34:29.591 --> 34:32.192
Oh, come on. She's gonna tell someone.

34:32.226 --> 34:34.594
Everyone.

34:36.731 --> 34:41.235
I still can't believe that stupid
Sausage King's kid is having a baby.

34:41.270 --> 34:43.205
What is going on at that high school?

34:43.239 --> 34:46.206
No pregnant teens at your high school?

34:46.242 --> 34:48.141
Oh, yeah. Plenty of them.

34:48.179 --> 34:49.911
I was hoping to be one.

34:49.945 --> 34:52.813
Obviously that's not gonna happen.

34:52.848 --> 34:53.815
What?

34:53.849 --> 34:55.850
I'm joking.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.986
Nobody wants to be a teenage mother.

34:58.020 --> 35:00.322
I don't wanna be a teenage father.

35:00.356 --> 35:01.790
But you are.

35:01.824 --> 35:03.290
And that's just how it is, Ben.

35:03.325 --> 35:04.992
You just have to accept that.

35:05.026 --> 35:07.461
And you have to accept that Amy
- Ow.

35:07.496 --> 35:09.630
That Amy will someday come
around, and you'll be friends.

35:09.664 --> 35:11.799
We'll all be friends... someday.

35:11.833 --> 35:14.969
I can't believe I didn't
hear between the lines.

35:16.337 --> 35:18.438
That's why she told me
not to call this weekend.

35:18.472 --> 35:20.640
I know why. Ricky.

35:20.675 --> 35:23.477
I thought she wanted to see me. I really
thought she wanted to see me and talk,

35:23.511 --> 35:25.479
but what are we gonna talk about?

35:25.513 --> 35:28.548
What are we gonna talk about
other than my having a baby?

35:28.582 --> 35:31.618
What a stupid, stupid thing I did.

35:31.652 --> 35:33.753
Stop beating yourself up. Things happen.

35:33.788 --> 35:35.155
Yeah. And who knows?

35:35.189 --> 35:37.857
Maybe this will all
turn out good in the end,

35:37.892 --> 35:40.293
and like Alice said,
we'll all be friends.

35:40.327 --> 35:42.795
Impossible.

35:46.233 --> 35:48.001
Yeah, she's here.

35:48.035 --> 35:50.804
And Ben said he was gonna go
to the doctor with her today.

35:50.838 --> 35:52.606
Thanks, Leo.

35:55.676 --> 35:59.311
Hmm. This could be good.

35:59.346 --> 36:02.081
That's the last time you
sleep in my room. You got that?

36:03.383 --> 36:06.052
Oh, that's where he
was. How was the par-tay?

36:06.086 --> 36:07.419
Good.

36:11.889 --> 36:13.989
We should go get some breakfast.

36:14.024 --> 36:15.858
Yeah, let's do it.

36:15.892 --> 36:17.893
Go have some breakfast, I mean.

36:17.927 --> 36:19.394
Yeah, I knew what you meant.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.629
Did you?

36:21.663 --> 36:23.297
Yeah.

36:31.645 --> 36:33.179
<i>So how'd it go? Here. ROGENA SKIN CARE.</i>

36:33.213 --> 36:35.114
It's my baby's first sonogram.

36:35.148 --> 36:37.149
Wow.

36:37.183 --> 36:40.518
This is amazing. So,
is it a boy or girl?

36:40.552 --> 36:42.253
Oh, it's still too early to tell.

36:43.488 --> 36:45.255
I can't believe I can
already see my baby.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.690
It's so exciting.

36:46.724 --> 36:48.992
Or it would be if I were
ten years older and married.

36:49.026 --> 36:51.894
But it still is. This is a baby.

36:53.430 --> 36:56.598
Yeah. My baby.

36:56.632 --> 36:59.367
It's the first time I really
felt like I'm having a baby.

36:59.401 --> 37:01.302
Hey, where's Ben?

37:01.336 --> 37:03.303
Oh, I dropped him off at home.

37:03.337 --> 37:05.338
They gave him a copy of the picture,

37:05.372 --> 37:07.907
and I think he was kind of overwhelmed

37:07.941 --> 37:10.375
and nauseous.

37:17.348 --> 37:19.716
I can't believe that's my baby.

37:20.718 --> 37:22.486
I can't believe that's my baby.

37:22.520 --> 37:25.989
Yeah, well, did you pass out?

37:26.023 --> 37:28.558
Well, my knees got a little weak, but...

37:28.592 --> 37:31.627
Yeah. I'm just glad I was there.

37:31.661 --> 37:33.428
Or near there anyway.

37:33.463 --> 37:35.630
I missed all that with Amy.

37:35.665 --> 37:38.399
But that wasn't my baby.

37:38.434 --> 37:41.234
This is my baby.

37:41.269 --> 37:44.870
This is my little guy
- or girl or guy.

37:44.905 --> 37:47.272
I kind of hope it's a girl.

37:47.307 --> 37:50.142
Yeah, I hope it's a girl. I
have a feeling it's a girl.

37:50.176 --> 37:51.977
And then you and Adrian could teach her

37:52.011 --> 37:53.879
all about the birds and
the bees when she grows up.

37:53.913 --> 37:55.580
Hank. Wrong time.

37:55.614 --> 37:58.149
What? I didn't say
"sex. " You know what?

37:59.451 --> 38:01.985
I'm gonna marry her.

38:03.521 --> 38:06.288
I'm gonna do what you said,
and I'm just going to accept

38:06.322 --> 38:08.157
that this is my fate,

38:08.192 --> 38:10.159
and I'm gonna marry Adrian
and learn to love her.

38:10.193 --> 38:13.062
All right. If you do decide that
you want to ask her to marry you,

38:13.096 --> 38:14.763
leave out "fate" and
"learn to love her. "

38:14.798 --> 38:17.502
Yeah. I'd even leave
out, "Will you marry me?"

38:19.371 --> 38:22.239
I'm not letting you do this. I
don't care whose father is behind it-

38:22.273 --> 38:24.041
yours or hers
- you are not getting married.

38:24.075 --> 38:26.877
I might. I might just do that.

38:26.911 --> 38:30.147
Oh, no. Y-

38:30.181 --> 38:33.650
You wouldn't marry Adrian
just to get ba at Ricky and?

38:34.652 --> 38:37.187
Oh, no. I get it.

38:37.222 --> 38:39.089
I totally get it.

38:39.123 --> 38:41.324
If you say you're going to marry Adrian,

38:41.358 --> 38:42.759
either Amy will stop you-

38:42.793 --> 38:45.528
Or you'll be married. No, Ben.

38:46.430 --> 38:47.930
So what?

38:49.833 --> 38:52.234
Music is important to me. I love music.

38:52.269 --> 38:53.869
I love all kinds of music.

38:53.904 --> 38:55.371
What kind of music do you like best?

38:55.405 --> 38:57.740
I like jazz.

38:57.775 --> 38:59.008
Yeah, jazz.

38:59.043 --> 39:01.177
I like classical, too. I love big bands.

39:01.211 --> 39:02.978
I like big bands.

39:03.013 --> 39:06.982
I used to listen to Buddy Rich,
Gene Krupa, this guy Bill Richmond.

39:07.017 --> 39:09.351
You know, Richmond wrote some
of the Jerry Lewis movies.

39:09.386 --> 39:10.519
I love Jerry Lewis.

39:10.553 --> 39:13.222
You're kidding me. I hate Jerry Lewis.

39:13.256 --> 39:15.424
Three Stooges? No.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.859
Marx Brothers? No.

39:18.895 --> 39:21.096
<i>Dumb and Dumber. I loved that.</i>

39:21.130 --> 39:24.065
Me, too. When he hit
her with that snowball...

39:24.099 --> 39:26.233
Yeah!

39:31.539 --> 39:34.908
I love moo shu pork. They
never give me enough duck sauce.

39:34.942 --> 39:36.409
I don't really eat that much pork.

39:36.444 --> 39:37.844
Because you're Jewish?

39:37.878 --> 39:39.946
Half Jewish. My dad.

39:39.980 --> 39:43.116
He beat the crap out of me and
my mom, but he never ate pork.

39:44.352 --> 39:46.487
Ricky, your childhood
was so sad and scary.

39:46.521 --> 39:49.424
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. I
don't want you to feel sorry for me.

39:49.459 --> 39:51.092
I'm nothing like my dad or my mom.

39:51.126 --> 39:53.427
Yeah, me, neither.

39:55.930 --> 39:57.564
Why is that so funny?

39:57.599 --> 39:59.500
'Cause I've spent the
last two weeks with them.

39:59.534 --> 40:01.101
Oh...

40:04.438 --> 40:06.272
I can't believe she kissed you.

40:06.307 --> 40:09.343
I kissed her back, so you
can't just blame Ashley.

40:09.377 --> 40:12.646
I blame you, too. Was it a long kiss?

40:12.681 --> 40:15.015
Long enough. I didn't
time it or anything.

40:15.049 --> 40:16.750
Did you feel anything?

40:16.784 --> 40:18.119
Regret.

40:19.188 --> 40:20.489
Maybe a little something.

40:20.523 --> 40:21.490
Ricky!

40:21.525 --> 40:22.925
I'm a guy.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.027
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't feel anything.

40:26.062 --> 40:28.098
Hey, I'm making progress. I
didn't try to sleep with her.

40:28.132 --> 40:30.233
If she wanted to sleep with
you, would you sleep with her?

40:30.267 --> 40:32.669
Depends on how aggressive she is

40:32.703 --> 40:35.405
and whether or not
your parents are home.

40:35.439 --> 40:37.273
I'm kidding. Really, I'm kidding.

40:37.307 --> 40:39.776
I would never, ever sleep with
your sister unless you're dead.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.914
I'm sorry. It must be the jet lag.

40:44.948 --> 40:46.682
I'm joking. I'm just joking.

40:46.717 --> 40:48.718
I can't believe that you said that.

40:48.752 --> 40:52.087
Hey, tell me you haven't thought that your
life would be easier if I weren't around.

40:52.122 --> 40:54.423
Yeah, I've thought that. Too quick.

41:00.563 --> 41:02.365
I should get going.

41:02.399 --> 41:03.966
Why? It's late.

41:04.001 --> 41:07.337
I told your parents that we
- that we wouldn't do anything.

41:07.371 --> 41:09.806
We're not doing anything.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.041
Well, when could we do something?

41:12.076 --> 41:14.844
Could we do something?
Could we ever have sex again?

41:14.879 --> 41:17.848
Whoa, whoa. Conversation
took a turn here.

41:19.150 --> 41:21.184
I don't know.

41:21.219 --> 41:23.653
I don't know if we could
ever have sex again.

41:23.688 --> 41:26.723
Could you ever not sleep with every
girl you got the chance to sleep with?

41:26.757 --> 41:28.492
I'm working on that.

41:28.526 --> 41:30.360
Which means you're
still sleeping around.

41:30.394 --> 41:32.362
I'm still sleeping around.

41:32.396 --> 41:35.298
Well, if you ever wanna sleep with
me again, you'll stop doing that.

41:35.332 --> 41:38.301
I'll stop doing that. Ricky,
it's one thing to say that,

41:38.335 --> 41:40.603
but it's another thing to not
do it with anyone else but me.

41:40.637 --> 41:42.605
And it would have to
be no one else but me.

41:42.639 --> 41:44.606
I would want an exclusive relationship.

41:44.641 --> 41:47.109
And even then, I would insist
that you get tested for HIV

41:47.143 --> 41:49.545
and anything else
before we had sex again.

41:49.579 --> 41:51.012
And I'd still wanna use condoms.

41:51.047 --> 41:52.747
Well, I would want
you to be on the pill.

41:52.782 --> 41:54.749
I am on the pill.

41:54.784 --> 41:56.685
Why? Why are you on the pill?

41:56.719 --> 41:59.187
Because of you. Because
I know what can happen,

41:59.222 --> 42:01.823
and it's never gonna happen
unintentionally again.

42:11.702 --> 42:14.537
So you're saying that one day,
you'd like to have more children.

42:14.571 --> 42:16.572
I don't know.

42:16.606 --> 42:19.974
I love John. I really love him.

42:21.143 --> 42:24.645
I wish we were older, but we weren't.

42:25.614 --> 42:27.948
I love him so much it's crazy.

42:27.983 --> 42:29.817
He's so cute. Isn't he cute?

42:29.851 --> 42:32.353
He's my kid. Of course
he's cute. I'm cute.

42:32.387 --> 42:34.288
We're a cute family.

42:34.322 --> 42:36.423
Not family, but whatever we are.

42:36.458 --> 42:38.425
What do you want us to be?

42:38.460 --> 42:41.295
I don't know.

42:41.329 --> 42:43.397
I really don't.

42:43.431 --> 42:46.534
I think it's too soon to decide.

42:46.568 --> 42:50.437
I don't know. I really don't.

42:50.472 --> 42:52.973
Me, neither.

42:53.008 --> 42:55.776
John's over a year old.

42:55.810 --> 42:57.778
He's walking.

42:57.812 --> 42:59.713
Maybe we should decide.

42:59.748 --> 43:01.148
He walks funny.

43:01.182 --> 43:03.150
He runs funny.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
