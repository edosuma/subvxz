00:02.469 --> 00:04.767
I never dreamt
I'd be traveling the whole world

00:04.838 --> 00:06.806
with a boy who never left the house.

00:06.873 --> 00:10.502
This has to end. If he's having marital
problems, I should be helping him.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.670
I should not be pickling his wife.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.680
Leslie's... my girlfriend.

00:14.748 --> 00:19.310
I will not even take a nap until you and
your entire gang are suffering sideways.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.616
Until Nick is gone
for another ten years.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.122
Hey, Eddie.
Making sure we're still on for 3:00.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.488
Maybe he didn't go to the barbecue.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.323
- Doesn't want to be seen with me.
- [Hannah] Don't go there.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.158
[Sam] My mom broke up with Big Cat.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.358
Maybe now you and her
could get together.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.800
- [Lkey] You think the kid is yours?
- Peanut allergy, he's got one.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.030
I need Nick.
Where's Nick?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.603
Have you met Aubrey?

00:44.844 --> 00:45.078
- [Car tires screeching]
- [Crashing]

00:45.078 --> 00:47.376
- [Car tires screeching]
- [Crashing]

00:49.849 --> 00:53.216
- [Commander] Don't move him.
- [Leslie] I think he's breathing.

00:53.319 --> 00:56.652
[Commander] Oh!
Stay with me, son. Oh, no...

00:59.459 --> 01:03.987
- How is he?
- Well, they're not sure yet.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.692
- What happened?
- The kid took a spill on his bike.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.825
Ass over tea kettle on the handle bars.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.133
The doctors think there's
internal bleeding from the fall.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.763
- Where's Hannah?
- With Sam.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.967
- How did this happen?
- We're not sure.

01:16.042 --> 01:17.873
We heard tires screeching,

01:17.944 --> 01:21.573
ran out and Mrs. Womack saw Sam lyin'
in the middle of the road, wiped out.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.014
She drove around the corner,
almost creamed him.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.713
- Your father had Ronnie call EMS.
- He wasn't breathing right.

01:27.787 --> 01:31.883
The paramedics said a respiratory
distress caused the blackout.

01:31.958 --> 01:35.325
- Why was he having trouble breathing?
- His peanut allergy.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.421
- No way.
- [Lkey] For real?

01:38.531 --> 01:42.467
He must have eaten peanuts,
but nobody knows what or why.

01:43.870 --> 01:48.034
Which is crazy because he's always
so super-careful about those things.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.669
<i>He used to joke he doesn't even like
reading the Peanuts comic strip,</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:54.508
because he's afraid
it'll make his throat close.

01:54.581 --> 02:00.213
<i>The Sticky Monster! OK, everybody.
Everybody has to try Alison's favorite,</i>

02:00.286 --> 02:02.811
<i>- macadamia peanut butter cake!
- [Lkey] Yeah!</i>

02:08.360 --> 02:10.794
Is he OK?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.300
He's a dad.

- Hmm...
- Comfy?

02:50.336 --> 02:53.863
I like it here, in your arms.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.906
Well, we fit together...
Good proportions.

02:58.912 --> 03:02.973
- Ergonomically, we work.
- Mmm...

03:03.049 --> 03:07.076
It's time for me
to feed the starving masses, isn't it?

03:07.153 --> 03:09.849
Sadly, yes.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.582
Well, duty calls.

03:14.227 --> 03:17.685
And you know what they call a pizza
without a pizza delivery girl?

03:17.764 --> 03:18.890
No, what?

03:18.965 --> 03:21.229
Nothing but a slab of bread,
cheese and sauce

03:21.301 --> 03:22.859
growing cold on the counter

03:22.936 --> 03:26.303
under the glowering glare
of Mr. Sonny Pippilito, my boss.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.535
Or, as he is also known,
"The Hairiest Man in All the World."

03:30.243 --> 03:33.974
I'm genuinely crazy about this girl.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.917
- Who are you talking to?
- Invisible Tom.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.878
Right. Well,
more about him later, OK?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.387
Sure.

03:42.455 --> 03:45.947
It's fine. What would a shut-in be
without a few imaginary friends?

03:46.025 --> 03:49.188
It's when they start to feel threatened
by you that we should worry.

03:51.497 --> 03:55.058
I can't believe a fraternity house
moved into your neighborhood.

03:55.134 --> 03:58.661
Did you know that 80 percent
of U.S. Presidents since 1900

03:58.738 --> 04:00.899
were members of a fraternity?

04:01.007 --> 04:03.373
[Indistinct shouting]

04:03.476 --> 04:06.934
I think these guys are in danger
of bringing down that statistic.

<i>[Man on PA] Dr. Bennett to radiology.</i>

04:18.757 --> 04:20.452
How is he?

04:20.526 --> 04:23.654
Well, he just got out of the CAT scan...

04:25.098 --> 04:28.033
...and the bleeding in his belly
is getting worse.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.433
They have to operate.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.998
They have to cut open my little boy.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.269
But they said he's gonna be fine, right?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.440
Hannah?

04:41.514 --> 04:43.675
No, Nick. They didn't say that.

04:44.751 --> 04:48.915
A whole team of doctors and not one
of them ever said he was gonna be fine.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.752
- Well, what did they say?
- OK, OK, enough talk.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.156
Come on, let's go sit down.

<i>[Woman on PA] Occupational therapist.</i>

04:59.966 --> 05:03.231
You know, I ran out there
and I saw this kid lyin' in the street.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.066
And it's awful, but it got more awful.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.939
I thought, this kid, lyin' in the road,
he could be my own flesh and blood.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.973
I know.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.544
If something happens to him, the fact
I missed out on these last ten years...

05:24.457 --> 05:27.949
Missing out on ten years
with your son...

05:28.027 --> 05:29.961
Nothin' easy about that.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.537
Oh, excuse me,
are you in charge of Sam Daniels?

05:49.615 --> 05:51.708
I am.
We're headed into surgery now.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.217
OK. Is he gonna be OK?

05:53.286 --> 05:59.054
- He's in very good hands.
- Sir, um, his allergic reaction.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.616
I think I know what caused it.

06:01.694 --> 06:06.654
It was macadamia peanut butter frosting
from my wife's birthday cake.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.394
I think I accidentally
put it on his face, and...

06:09.469 --> 06:12.632
- OK, thanks.
- I was the Sticky Monster.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.798
- I understand.
- You do?

06:14.874 --> 06:15.932
I do.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.042
<i>[PA]... any available

06:19.145 --> 06:21.978
Nick, we're gonna head out.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.984
Leslie's got some stuff she's gotta do,
and I don't think we can be much help.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.519
I understand.

06:27.587 --> 06:30.556
- Sam will be in my prayers.
- Thank you.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.460
- I think I'm gonna hang.
- I think you should.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.987
- Thanks for coming with me, though.
- He'll be OK.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.431
Yeah, I hope so.

06:43.002 --> 06:47.564
- I'm mind-kissing you right now.
- You are?

06:47.673 --> 06:48.935
I am.

06:49.008 --> 06:53.342
Between the dean, the dad, the ex,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.075
the setting, the circumstances...

06:56.149 --> 06:58.709
I think a mind-kiss is most appropriate.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.210
And Gabriel Diaz
taught his daughter one thing

07:02.288 --> 07:04.654
before he up and left
with her piano teacher.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.385
- And that was?
- Appropriateness.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.428
Oh. [chuckles]

07:10.730 --> 07:13.062
I'll come back later. If that's OK.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.465
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.835
We should do this again sometime.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.708
I would love to.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.271
How about we hit the museum?

07:30.349 --> 07:33.113
<i>They're showing Lawrence of Arabia
in crisp 70MM,</i>

07:33.186 --> 07:35.916
and you kind of remind me
of Peter O'Toole.

07:35.988 --> 07:41.449
Yeah. Us chiseled British
rapscallions are often confused.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.154
So we can go?

07:46.165 --> 07:49.225
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.271
I totally spaced.

07:52.338 --> 07:56.502
It's OK, but have no fear.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.034
I do own the re-mastered version,
never viewed.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.478
We could peel back
the cellophane together.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.709
How could a girl say no?

08:07.186 --> 08:10.952
How you doin'? I'm Chug.
We just moved in across the street.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.684
Great. Can I help ya?

08:12.758 --> 08:15.818
You got any sugar?
We're makin' a grain alcohol punch.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.591
- Really? Did you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.929
That's fantastic.
It really... It really happens?

08:22.001 --> 08:25.698
- What really happens?
- A neighbor, borrowing a cup of sugar.

08:25.771 --> 08:26.863
It's...

08:28.441 --> 08:30.602
Never mind, it's, um...

08:30.676 --> 08:33.008
Forget it, I'll go get you some sugar.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.846
You're the pizza delivery chick,
aren't you?

08:39.885 --> 08:41.649
- Yup.
- Nice.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.581
I love pizza.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.687
Here you go.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.787
Thanks, dude.
Peace out.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.662
Well, he seems like a nice enough guy.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.295
I hope tomorrow he needs an egg.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.410
- You don't have to stay.
- I know. I want to.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.003
Why?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.571
- Sam's my friend.
- Sam can't be your friend.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.381
- Sam's ten.
- I'll just stay a little while longer.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.284
Suit yourself.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.391
- Arturo Tusk-anini!
- Who?

09:20.459 --> 09:21.824
Sam's teddy bear.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.022
It's a walrus with one eye,
but he never sleeps without it.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.156
You want it
when he wakes up from surgery.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.100
- I'll run back to the house and get it.
- Thanks, Janet.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.638
Hey... I just heard.
How's Sam?

09:36.876 --> 09:38.434
Touch-and-go.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.681
- Look, Janet, about the barbecue...
- Don't. Not now.

09:43.749 --> 09:47.515
Sam's in surgery and Hannah wants me
to get his one-eyed teddy-walrus.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.851
And, in the grand scheme
of what's important and what's not,

09:50.923 --> 09:53.357
the one-eyed teddy-walrus takes priority

09:53.426 --> 09:55.860
over an explanation
for why you blew me off.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.590
- Well, let me come with you.
- Not necessary.

09:58.664 --> 10:04.534
I won't slow you down, and you don't
have to talk to me if you don't want to.

10:05.671 --> 10:08.697
Hell, you can...
You can even put me in the trunk.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.802
I'd like to put you in the trunk
and drive the car into a lake.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.707
OK, let's go.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.453
[Owen] Hannah?

10:28.427 --> 10:32.386
- Hey, Owen.
- This is all because of me.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.056
What is?

10:35.301 --> 10:39.635
Sam's allergic reaction.
I'm the one who caused it.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.570
You? Um...

10:42.141 --> 10:43.972
At the barbecue.

10:44.844 --> 10:47.210
Alison's birthday cake,

10:47.313 --> 10:49.747
the macadamia peanut butter frosting,

10:49.815 --> 10:53.683
it got on my fingers
and I played Sticky Monster.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.017
I wasn't thinking.

10:56.856 --> 11:00.121
Some of it got on Sam's cheek.
He must have licked it off.

11:00.192 --> 11:04.128
I should have said something
when we got here, I know, but...

11:04.196 --> 11:05.857
- [Nick] Hannah!
- [Gasps]

11:11.203 --> 11:12.329

Fifty-six years, wow.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.809
The doctors said
she's not in very good shape this time.

11:55.414 --> 11:59.373
They told me to prepare for the worst.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.578
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

12:06.125 --> 12:10.084
- How old is your son?
- My son is ten.

12:20.239 --> 12:24.005
My grandfather taught me,
when I started drinking coffee,

12:24.076 --> 12:27.341
to like it without cream or sugar,

12:28.681 --> 12:33.015
'cause you never really can
count on there being cream or sugar.

12:34.987 --> 12:39.083
You should go back to the hospital.

12:39.158 --> 12:42.025
Oh, what for?

12:43.129 --> 12:45.461
You should be there.
Nick really needs you.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.499
It's not that kind of relationship,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.625
which is why, I guess,
it was so easy for him

12:49.702 --> 12:54.366
to just get out and go
without ever lookin' back.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.969
You know, Robert, it's times like these
that we should put our anger aside.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.206
I'm not angry. I admire it.

13:03.315 --> 13:05.215
He's a strong kid, he's tough.

13:05.284 --> 13:10.586
You're getting a chance at a do-over.
Most people never get a do-over.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.817
Be a shame to squander it.

13:16.896 --> 13:21.356
We used to do this thing,
when the boys were very young.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.569
And I'd open my arms wide and...

13:28.040 --> 13:31.168
I'd say, "I got hugs for sale."

13:32.144 --> 13:33.805
And they'd say, "How much?"

13:35.481 --> 13:37.745
And I'd say...

13:39.685 --> 13:44.247
"This one's for free, but
I'm chargin' you double for the next."

13:46.325 --> 13:48.054
And then, um...

13:49.695 --> 13:53.062
- You'd hug.
- We'd hug.

14:01.373 --> 14:02.704
You OK?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.413
I was the guy who would eat
six buckets of fried chicken

14:09.481 --> 14:13.645
'cause Eddie said
he'd give me 50 dollars if I did.

14:13.752 --> 14:17.051
Or start a bar fight

14:17.122 --> 14:20.148
because one of 'em looked at lkey wrong.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.057
I was that guy.

14:22.127 --> 14:26.689
You could count on me for dumb stuff,
on the constant.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.670
But then I met you,
and we started our family,

14:31.737 --> 14:34.297
and that guy went away

14:34.373 --> 14:40.312
because the thought of doing
anything to jeopardize my family,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.745
ruining what
we've worked so hard to build...

14:42.815 --> 14:44.077
Is horrifying.

14:44.149 --> 14:47.676
Which is why I can't understand
why I would do something so stupid.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.417
What I know is that
you are an amazing parent...

14:55.895 --> 15:00.355
...and an amazing husband,
and that nothing you could ever do

15:00.432 --> 15:03.799
could compromise the life
we have built for ourselves.

15:15.281 --> 15:18.717
Six buckets of fried chicken?

15:18.784 --> 15:22.015
I was a savage. You saved me.

15:36.535 --> 15:37.832
[Breathing rapidly]

15:39.038 --> 15:41.199
- What happened?
- Mmm!

15:41.273 --> 15:43.707
Unbelievable!

15:44.543 --> 15:48.035
- Have you been drinking?
- Yeah, this is how I drink.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.479
I pour the beer all over my body.

15:50.549 --> 15:55.111
- I find osmosis gives me a better buzz.
- You're being sarcastic.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.246
- Yes, I am.
- Please tell me what happened.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.551
I delivered ten pies
to the house across the way.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.256
- The frat house?
- Yeah. Yeah, to Chug and his friends.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.356
You remember Chug, right?

16:07.433 --> 16:10.800
Clearly they were successful
with their grain alcohol punch,

16:10.903 --> 16:12.928
but they had little interest in pizza.

16:13.005 --> 16:16.736
They pawed at me, they tossed me around,
they sprayed beer all over me.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.835
It was like a rugby match,
only I was the ball.

16:20.479 --> 16:24.506
- It's a ball in rugby, right?
- It is. Can you please continue?

16:24.583 --> 16:27.814
My boob was grabbed. They howled.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.251
They were howling.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.289
Your boob was grabbed and they howled?

16:31.390 --> 16:32.652
I had it under control.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.285
I kicked one of the guys, hard,
in the nuggets,

16:35.394 --> 16:38.852
and he howled on top of the howling.
Then I ran as fast as I could over here.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.393
Is that blood?

16:43.302 --> 16:44.792
It's tomato sauce.

- Phil, don't.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.204
What are you...?

16:52.277 --> 16:55.440
I will smote them.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.573
Or smite them. Smit?

16:58.650 --> 17:02.017
It's what...
How do you even conjugate that verb?

17:02.121 --> 17:04.351
- Phil, don't be ridiculous.
- I will!

17:04.423 --> 17:05.946

17:16.101 --> 17:18.069
- It's OK, man.
- It's not OK.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.565
They're just stupid kids.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.166

Good. It's good.

I can't do it.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.698
Oh.

17:55.307 --> 17:59.266

she'd only have to sit till 11:00.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.507
OK. I think I'm gonna stick around
here for a little bit,

I figured you would. Hmm.

18:14.927 --> 18:20.092

'cause I left my phone in my truck.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.565
Thanks, buddy.
Good night. Bye.

Bye.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.504
It's not in his bedroom.

18:32.578 --> 18:35.741
Well, what's it look like?
What color is it?

18:35.814 --> 18:37.577
Like a one-eyed walrus.

18:37.649 --> 18:41.016
Most likely encrusted in dirt and drool.
Please start looking.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.587
OK, OK. Why the panic?

18:42.654 --> 18:45.623
It's the least I can do for them,
after what I've caused.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.454
What are you talkin' about?

18:47.526 --> 18:51.087
If I hadn't actually believed
in the possibility of a "we," an "us,"

18:51.196 --> 18:52.823
a "Janet and Eddie,"

18:52.898 --> 18:56.459
then Hannah wouldn't have sent
Sam to the barbecue to find you,

18:56.535 --> 19:00.494
- and none of this would have happened.
- Janet, it's gonna be OK.

19:00.572 --> 19:04.531
I can't even look at you without wanting
to break something over your head.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.806
Something heavy,
like a bottle or a cement truck.

19:10.716 --> 19:13.947
The thing that kills me,
Eddie, no fooling,

19:14.019 --> 19:16.920
is that I feel like I've lost a friend.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.457
And when you've never
been in a relationship,

19:19.525 --> 19:21.686
friends are what you cherish.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.988
Well, I...

19:24.796 --> 19:26.821
You've never been in a relationship?

19:26.899 --> 19:29.197
Not now. Walrus!

Italian conductor of his time.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.971
Yeah, he's a good egg, Sam.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.679
Hannah told me
you come by every now and then.

19:49.788 --> 19:52.256

really got you that busted up?

It's very upsetting,
but that's not all.

21:32.357 --> 21:35.121
- [Coughs]
- You scared me.

21:35.927 --> 21:38.623
Well, hospitals can be scary places.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.257
Yeah, made more so
when you just sneak up behind a guy.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.194
- Can I buy you a drink?
- They got cocoa?

21:45.270 --> 21:48.137
Yeah, probably not very good.

21:48.206 --> 21:52.040
Well, bad cocoa is better then good tea,

21:58.250 --> 22:02.016
I married her the same day
Marilyn Monroe married Arthur Miller.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.189
That was a joke to our friends,

22:05.257 --> 22:09.694
because Rose was beautiful,
and I was... me.

22:09.761 --> 22:14.425
I even had the Arthur Miller spectacles.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.059
Which I always thought
was a better word than glasses.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.002
Like everything you look at
through them is a spectacle.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.131
She was.

22:22.207 --> 22:27.873
My Rose, when I first met her,
I wasn't sure she liked me.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.879
My father said,
"You know, Rose at the bakery,

22:30.982 --> 22:33.746
she sure is sweet on you."

22:33.852 --> 22:35.376
I said, "How do you know?"

22:35.454 --> 22:40.414
He said, "Well, every time you walk
out of the room, her eyes turn grey.

22:41.626 --> 22:45.585
And when you return,
they turn blue again."

22:45.664 --> 22:47.791
I said, "That's impossible."

22:47.866 --> 22:50.699
He said, "How do you know, smart guy?

22:50.769 --> 22:54.432
You ever seen the color of her eyes
when you're not in the room?"

22:59.244 --> 23:00.871
Look, I'd like to stay.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.813
It's gonna be a long night
and Janet's coming back,

23:03.882 --> 23:06.908
and my parents
are driving in from the Cape.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.715
Ray, there's really nothing
to do here but wait.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.881
Yeah, of course, you've got Garrett.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.016
- He's leaving.
- Hannah, I'm sorry.

23:14.092 --> 23:18.461
Uh, I said I wasn't gonna bring it up...
Don't bring it up.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.162

not even six minutes in?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.292
- You bring it up.
- Yeah.

23:28.673 --> 23:31.608

- OK.

- I just got off the phone with Eddie.

Physical Phil's in a bad way.
We gotta get over there.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.789
What's wrong?
Batteries run out on his remote?

24:51.857 --> 24:54.223
- Oliver Stone got the flu?
- This isn't funny.

24:54.292 --> 24:57.455
We're in hardcore
"honor amongst men" territory here.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.928
Great, my specialty.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.233
This is where he was born.

25:09.541 --> 25:10.872
Sam?

25:16.781 --> 25:19.841
Was his father here, when he was born?

25:20.986 --> 25:22.749
No, he wasn't.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.519
What goes on
with this Gavin Goddard guy?

25:29.928 --> 25:32.761
Please let's not
talk about him right now.

25:46.545 --> 25:50.106
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.540
Did you ever miss me?

25:54.619 --> 25:57.349
Hannah, of course, I missed you.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.681
I didn't understand.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.162
How could I? I mean, it was so...

26:06.798 --> 26:09.096
How could he not come home?

26:10.168 --> 26:12.659
Come back... to me?

26:14.506 --> 26:17.441
Because all I thought about
that whole summer...

26:18.643 --> 26:20.611
...was seeing you again.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.441
You don't know how many times
I wanted to call,

26:25.550 --> 26:30.578
how many times
I reached for the phone, but...

26:43.335 --> 26:45.803
Freshman year,
when I broke my ankle skating?

26:45.870 --> 26:47.963
You and Eddie made me those crutches.

26:48.807 --> 26:51.503
Made out of hockey sticks and duct tape.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.410
I loved those crutches.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.748
You guys scrawled the lyrics

26:59.851 --> 27:03.218
of every Soundgarden song
ever written all over them.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.051
And long after my ankle healed,

27:06.124 --> 27:08.649
sometimes, when my parents
and Billy were out,

27:08.727 --> 27:11.992
I would walk on those crutches.

27:12.797 --> 27:16.563
Like, way beyond after I needed them,
I would just walk on them,

27:16.668 --> 27:20.434
just because you made them for me.

27:21.573 --> 27:26.840
And I really, really, really
loved leaning on them.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.712
So, Phil, so did they touch her?

27:36.788 --> 27:39.916
They touched and they shook
and they howled.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.754
You didn't say shook!

27:41.826 --> 27:44.488
- Those animals.
- We're working on the payback.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.894
Phys is trying
to get their heat shut off.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.126
It's not too bad,
a cold front's coming in.

27:49.234 --> 27:52.601
When I think of the names
they must have called her, awful names.

27:52.704 --> 27:55.036
Wait. They called her names?
Who are they?

27:55.106 --> 27:57.472
They don't have the right
to even have names!

27:57.575 --> 27:59.668
- Owen, chill!
- No, lkey, I will not.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.235
You know what?
I'm taking away their names!

28:02.313 --> 28:05.646
I'll knock their names off their faces.
I will own their names!

28:05.717 --> 28:07.548
Their names will be mine!

28:07.619 --> 28:09.780
- Stop him!
- Owen!

28:09.888 --> 28:11.788

28:11.856 --> 28:14.381

29:18.356 --> 29:23.316
You guys get a hall pass,
but don't take it lightly.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.396
You were spared.

29:25.497 --> 29:29.991
But if you ever engage in that type
of disrespect towards women again,

29:30.068 --> 29:31.433
we will be back.

29:31.503 --> 29:37.135
And that next time will make this time
look like the good old days.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.045
Come on.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.979
Mr. Bolivar, is there
any word on your wife?

29:47.051 --> 29:51.010
She's still with me.
That's all I can hope for.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.956
Miss Daniels,
your son is out of surgery.

29:55.026 --> 29:58.325
We found a splenic source
of his injury and tied it off.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.660
Barring a re-bleed, he should do fine.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.223
- Well, can I see him?
- He's still in recovery.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.825
He's sleeping...

30:04.903 --> 30:07.929
[woman] I'm sorry,
it's immediate family only.

30:09.841 --> 30:12.469
<i>[# Pearl Jam: Come Back]</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:20.541
What is it?

31:17.342 --> 31:19.367
Any news on the boy?

31:19.444 --> 31:22.277
They just went down to check on him.

31:22.347 --> 31:26.306
- They?
- The parents, Nick and Hannah.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.444
Oh, yeah. Nick and Hannah.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.455
It's been a hard night for those two.

31:34.092 --> 31:39.029
But they love each other,
as clear as day.

31:41.099 --> 31:43.260
And I've lived many days.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.344
My sweet boy.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.982
You are so beautiful.
Do you know that?

32:05.356 --> 32:06.983
Even like this,

32:07.058 --> 32:10.994
attached to things that boys your age
shouldn't be attached to.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.222
You're still beautiful.

32:17.702 --> 32:22.469
Thank you for being
so sweet and so kind.

32:24.842 --> 32:27.606
And for being
my best friend in the world.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.313
No one makes me laugh like you.

32:35.219 --> 32:38.780
And you love to do it when
I have a mouthful of soda, don't you?

32:38.890 --> 32:42.417
So that root beer
comes shooting out of my nose.

32:47.031 --> 32:49.090
I need you, buddy.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.465
I need you and I love you...

32:56.908 --> 33:00.469
And I miss you and
I can't wait to talk to you again.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.902
Hey, Dad, it's me. Um...

33:26.904 --> 33:28.599
Sam's out of surgery.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.972
It looks like he's gonna be all right.
Hannah's with him now.

33:32.744 --> 33:36.976
<i>Um... Ljust...</i>

33:39.150 --> 33:43.052
<i>Ljust wanted to tell you, OK?</i>

33:43.521 --> 33:45.079
<i>Bye.</i>

33:54.365 --> 33:56.731
Mr. Bolivar finally leave?

33:56.801 --> 33:59.497
I don't know, he just went
to the bathroom, I think.

34:00.638 --> 34:04.005
- Bad news about his wife?
- What do you mean?

34:04.075 --> 34:06.566
I mean, is she OK?

34:07.879 --> 34:10.438
Rose Bolivar died six days ago.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.248
She did?

34:13.317 --> 34:17.447
She did. That poor man
hasn't left this hospital since.

34:22.092 --> 34:25.927
- [Bolivar] How's the boy holdin' up?
- He's still sleeping.

34:28.766 --> 34:33.226
Mr. Bolivar, I don't mean
to be inappropriate, but, um...

34:34.472 --> 34:38.704
Well, the nurse,
she told me about Rose.

34:41.411 --> 34:46.076
- She told you about Rose?
- Yeah.

34:47.118 --> 34:50.178
I know it's hard,

34:50.254 --> 34:55.123
and I'm so sorry for your loss,
but you should go home.

34:55.193 --> 34:58.094
I'm sure that there's
somebody who can pick you up.

34:58.162 --> 35:00.528
I thought I would be with her forever.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.834
Everything we did, we did together.

35:07.371 --> 35:11.034
We arrived at this hospital together.

35:11.109 --> 35:16.137
If I pass through those doors,
out into there,

35:16.948 --> 35:22.215
it would be the first time I've seen
the world without Rose at my side.

35:23.855 --> 35:27.757
And that's not a world
I want to be a part of.

35:27.825 --> 35:31.784
A world where it's me without Rose.

35:33.731 --> 35:36.222
So I'll sit here...

35:39.537 --> 35:42.995
...in the place

35:43.074 --> 35:47.943
that Rose and I last knew... together.

35:53.718 --> 35:56.016
[Door opening]

35:57.488 --> 35:59.456
Hi!

35:59.557 --> 36:02.492
- You sent your friends?
- What?

36:02.560 --> 36:04.118
No, I didn't... I didn't...

36:04.228 --> 36:07.527
No, here's the thing.
I don't like fights, OK?

36:07.598 --> 36:11.830
Fights are gross, particularly the ones
you send your friends to fight for you,

36:11.903 --> 36:16.272
and that are brought to my boss'
attention, though I had this handled.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.433
They got fired up.
I couldn't stop them.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.842
It's sad, you know,
because I really like you.

36:21.913 --> 36:25.007
The fact that you don't leave
the house doesn't bother me.

36:25.082 --> 36:26.242
- Please.
- Until now.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.877
Because if you're gonna fight
your battles, much less my battles,

36:29.954 --> 36:32.980
from the comfort
of your own couch, well...

36:33.057 --> 36:35.890
I just don't think that's very
Peter O'Toole of you.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.623
All right, wait! Just wait.
Would you please wait?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.763
Wow.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.800
Sorry, Phys. That's our bad.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.002
Wow! Did... That's really...

36:53.077 --> 36:56.535
Did you... I don't... I can't believe...
Did... That's amazing!

36:56.614 --> 36:58.582
That astounds...

36:58.649 --> 37:01.982
Did you... She was my...
She was... She was...

37:02.053 --> 37:04.920
- She was my, my, my, my...
- Possibility.

37:05.923 --> 37:09.359
Yes. Possibility.

37:10.595 --> 37:15.555
- Exactly, man.
- Yeah... I know the feelin'.

37:18.102 --> 37:20.229
We've been living together five years.

37:20.304 --> 37:22.864
When are you gonna remember
I don't drink?

37:22.974 --> 37:25.534
I just keep holdin' out
hope for ya, pal.

37:33.684 --> 37:36.517
He's awake and they said
he's through the worst of it.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.282
Ohhh!

37:39.156 --> 37:41.021
Thanks, I really appreciate that.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.322
- Can we see him?
- Yeah, he'd love that.

37:43.394 --> 37:44.452
Yeah?

37:45.930 --> 37:49.491
I'm sorry, but it really is
immediate family only.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.671
- Sorry.
- Nah, you go ahead.

37:59.744 --> 38:03.510
- Tell him I'll be by later?
- OK.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.447
- Thank you for...
- Go.

38:07.518 --> 38:08.849
Like... OK.

38:14.058 --> 38:17.585
- If she needs anything, you call me.
- Absolutely.

38:17.662 --> 38:19.994
- Thank you.
- Take care, Nick.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.270
- Well, now, that's good news.
- Yeah.

38:27.772 --> 38:32.334
Well, what say we? Me and you.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.139
"Me and you" what?

38:34.211 --> 38:39.114
Shuffle on out of here. Couple of
mack daddies, walkin' in the sun?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.020
- I... I can't.
- Sure you can.

38:45.089 --> 38:48.547
It's a new day out there,
the great unknown.

38:50.294 --> 38:52.262
I just want to stay here.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.599
Look, it's daunting, I know.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.669
I mean, trust me,
nobody knows that more than I do.

38:59.537 --> 39:02.973
But we have to do this, to press on.

39:44.081 --> 39:46.049
That's what I'm talking about.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.716
[Audio muted]

39:57.895 --> 40:01.626
Rose, she loved the morning.

40:01.699 --> 40:05.066
She said every morning
was a clean slate,

40:05.136 --> 40:08.196
a chance to start things all over again.

40:08.272 --> 40:11.935
I wish I could have met her.
She sounds amazing.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.273
She was more than amazing.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.473
She was Rose, and there'll never be
another one like her again.

40:19.517 --> 40:22.179
You find that one, Nick...

40:23.220 --> 40:25.950
...the right one.
- Mm-hmm?

40:26.590 --> 40:29.753
It's a gift from God that not everyone
is lucky enough to receive,

40:29.860 --> 40:33.557
and you've got to accept that gift,
but you've got to accept it now.

40:35.132 --> 40:37.259
That's why it's called the present.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.468
- Hannah.
- No, not anymore.

40:43.474 --> 40:46.534
Hannah... She doesn't
have feelings for me like that.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.374
- You're wrong.
- I don't think so.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.381
What would you know, smart guy?

40:52.450 --> 40:56.352
Have you ever seen the color of her eyes
when you're not in the room?

41:00.324 --> 41:01.848
Good luck, Nick.

41:03.727 --> 41:06.161
Enjoy your present.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.528
I'll see you around, Mr. Bolivar.

41:09.500 --> 41:13.459
[Bell tolling]

41:21.545 --> 41:22.637
Dad?

41:24.882 --> 41:26.850
I got hugs for sale.

41:31.655 --> 41:32.815
How much?

41:34.425 --> 41:38.156
This one's free,
the next one I'll be charging double.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.327
It's gonna be all right.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.137
It'll be all right.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.310
[Phone ringing]

41:53.377 --> 41:55.641
The telephone, there it is!

41:55.713 --> 41:57.544
Hello?

41:57.615 --> 42:00.709
Owen Rowan, Ray Cataldo.

42:00.784 --> 42:03.218
Hey, Big Cat.
What goes on?

42:04.088 --> 42:06.249
Me and you should
go for a beer sometime.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.791
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

42:09.460 --> 42:12.725
Something I think
you're gonna find very interesting.
