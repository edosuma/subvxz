What's here for us to do this, sir?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.516
There's a vampire here.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.185
Vampire? What's that?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.310
A blood-sucking monster!

07:02.350 --> 07:05.725
Bloodless bodies were found
in villages this circus visited.

07:05.766 --> 07:07.391
There must be a vampire here.

07:07.435 --> 07:09.391
That makes no sense!

07:11.185 --> 07:14.266
I heard the magic you do is quite famous.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.725
Well,

07:15.935 --> 07:17.725
let's see what you've got.

Real swords?

08:23.391 --> 08:26.060
Yes! He puts a man in
a box and stabs it!

08:26.100 --> 08:27.185
That's crazy.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.559
The box is too small.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.640
There'll be room to avoid the swords.

08:41.684 --> 08:42.725
Don't worry.

08:52.141 --> 08:53.725
There's no room to avoid them!

08:54.141 --> 08:56.725
Magic is just trickery. Trust me.

08:58.310 --> 08:59.935
But I can't trust you!

09:02.141 --> 09:03.141
Help me! Help!

09:03.935 --> 09:05.266
It's too tight in here!

09:07.725 --> 09:09.225
Mommy!

09:20.475 --> 09:21.475
Sir!

09:22.685 --> 09:25.141
Please let me out!

09:28.350 --> 09:31.100
There's no room to hide!

09:37.100 --> 09:38.725
Take it out, jerk!

09:44.891 --> 09:45.891
Oh my!

10:05.975 --> 10:07.016
It's blood!

10:07.435 --> 10:08.516
Is he dead?

10:19.100 --> 10:20.810
Are you all right?

10:21.600 --> 10:22.810
I avoided them all.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.100
Blood...

10:49.975 --> 10:51.185
He's bleeding!

10:56.225 --> 10:58.391
I said the box was too
small, you son of a...

10:59.475 --> 11:00.725
Seo-pil!

11:01.225 --> 11:02.935
Help! My daughter is missing!

11:03.475 --> 11:04.766

11:06.100 --> 11:08.435
Please find my daughter!

11:12.516 --> 11:15.810

11:17.810 --> 11:22.141
Mommy! Where are you?

11:22.266 --> 11:23.766
Mommy!

11:24.435 --> 11:25.975
Mommy!

11:30.225 --> 11:31.225
You evil vampire!

11:32.475 --> 11:34.975
You killed innocent lives to save yours!

11:35.016 --> 11:36.350
How dare you!

11:42.391 --> 11:44.016
My hunch was right.

11:44.060 --> 11:47.141
Your curiosity will be the death of you!

11:57.641 --> 11:59.560
This time, I'll strike your head!

11:59.935 --> 12:01.475
Stop!

12:03.935 --> 12:04.935
Father.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.685
Let's stop now.

12:13.935 --> 12:15.475
No, son!

12:18.225 --> 12:20.141
Not a vampire, but a porphyrya patient?

12:21.225 --> 12:24.435
With low oxygen in the blood,
you get heart palpitations,

12:24.475 --> 12:26.641
shortness of breath, and heart enlargement.

12:27.850 --> 12:31.185
You killed innocent lives
to fill your lack of blood!

12:31.225 --> 12:35.225
My son is innocent. It's all my fault.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.350
Though you did it to save your son,

12:38.810 --> 12:42.225
your sins are no different
from those of vampires.

12:42.685 --> 12:45.350
Do you expect to live after what you did?

12:54.475 --> 12:56.935
<i>HONG TAE-MUN</i>

13:25.100 --> 13:27.475
What vampires?

13:27.516 --> 13:30.310
Are you going through puberty again?

13:30.350 --> 13:31.850
Having strange thoughts?

13:34.060 --> 13:35.391
Vampires exist.

13:35.935 --> 13:37.975
It's because you're not busy.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.060
You lost your post.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.310
The women you come on to, dump you.

13:42.685 --> 13:43.685
Do something!

13:44.266 --> 13:48.310
Such a pity that you think
the world is so puny.

13:50.225 --> 13:52.600
In 1742, a report was made

13:53.266 --> 13:55.935
about Scholar Choi and his servant.

13:56.685 --> 13:59.475
The servant saw a mysterious light.

13:59.516 --> 14:03.435
Then Choi vanished without a trace.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.891
And the peculiar plague years ago...

14:17.600 --> 14:20.766
The world is full of
unbelievable incidents.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.766
Who's to say vampires don't exist?

14:23.185 --> 14:24.391
Do you have proof?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.100
30 years ago,

14:26.560 --> 14:30.560
a Westerners' ship headed for
China ran aground in Joseon.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.600
There are records of
vampire sightings then.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.725
Come on, sir.

14:35.766 --> 14:38.560
Cut the nonsense and do
your detective work.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.641
Aren't you paying me rent?

14:40.685 --> 14:44.641
Stop roaming and go back
to your nice house.

14:44.685 --> 14:46.516
Then I'll have to get married!

14:50.350 --> 14:52.475
If you must, why not?

14:55.016 --> 14:59.891
I don't wish to marry without love.

15:00.350 --> 15:02.310
Then tell your father that.

15:02.725 --> 15:05.891
- He decided who I'll marry.
- So what?

15:05.935 --> 15:10.100
You're good at speaking your mind.
Can't you talk to your father?

15:10.141 --> 15:11.641
It's your life, sir!

15:12.975 --> 15:14.766
Just say no!

15:14.810 --> 15:18.391
Say you're not marrying a
stranger without love.

15:18.435 --> 15:19.475
I did!

15:19.600 --> 15:23.560
I told him it's my life and
he can't decide for me.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.100
And?

15:25.266 --> 15:26.266
I got slapped.

15:28.725 --> 15:30.350
He's firm.

15:31.310 --> 15:33.266
I thought the Premier would be different.

15:33.310 --> 15:34.475
Your Majesty!

15:34.935 --> 15:38.850
<i>PREMIER KIM SHIN</i>
Anticipation for the Full Moon Fest

15:38.891 --> 15:41.310
is high throughout Joseon.

15:42.060 --> 15:46.100
People of all ages are working hard

15:46.558 --> 15:54.891
to prepare a greater fest than
the one 30 years ago, sir.

15:59.475 --> 16:04.810
Recently, 10,000 people worked
on fortifying our forts.

16:05.516 --> 16:11.141
It must be hard for them to work
for the Full Moon Fest too.

16:12.016 --> 16:17.225
Thus, I shall grant a small reward
to the workers.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.475
Set rice as the only tributary.

16:21.891 --> 16:26.435
And have aristocrats pay
for the military cloth as well.

16:29.766 --> 16:35.685
I, Premier Kim Shin, request
to speak, Your Majesty.

16:36.685 --> 16:41.975
His Majesty's mercy and heart
for the people is like heaven.

16:42.516 --> 16:43.266
However,

16:43.310 --> 16:47.560
if aristocrats pay the same as peasants,

16:47.600 --> 16:50.391
what makes them different, sir?

16:50.891 --> 16:53.975
It'll destroy class distinction

16:54.016 --> 16:57.141
and shake the basis of Joseon, sir.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.310
Please, Your Majesty!

17:00.685 --> 17:04.310
Please retract your command, sir!

17:06.435 --> 17:09.435
Even the king can't have his way with him.

17:11.435 --> 17:14.724
Any functional problems in getting married?

17:14.766 --> 17:15.974
Why you little!

17:16.724 --> 17:17.891
Excuse me.

17:44.810 --> 17:45.810
Who?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.185
It's scorched rice tea.

17:57.225 --> 17:58.350
Thank you.

17:58.391 --> 18:00.935
It has a rich, deep flavor.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.850
I did a great job making it.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.975
Let me introduce myself.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.850
I'm the daughter of the
owner of Yeon-mi Lodge.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.141
How could we be of help?

18:16.725 --> 18:19.516
Recently, while repairing
building in Ganghwa,

18:19.560 --> 18:23.560
the roof suddenly caved
in and many workers died.

18:24.725 --> 18:29.185
While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.

18:29.725 --> 18:33.935
One was a skeleton and
the other was burned.

18:34.435 --> 18:37.600
However, the burnt one
wasn't decayed at all.

18:38.141 --> 18:40.766
But that's not all!

18:40.810 --> 18:42.641
While they went to report it,

18:43.266 --> 18:44.685
The corpse disappeared!

18:45.100 --> 18:47.641
Only the burnt corpse vanished!

18:47.935 --> 18:50.600
Then another incident happened soon after.

18:52.185 --> 18:54.141
It was quite peculiar.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.641
Some say a man burned
to death by an invisible fire.

18:58.725 --> 19:00.225
He died but was not dead.

19:00.266 --> 19:01.891
He lived but did not live!

19:02.266 --> 19:06.310
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

19:07.516 --> 19:10.766
The Full Moon Fest is taking
place after 30 years.

19:11.310 --> 19:15.060
My father has been ordered
by the court to prepare it.

19:15.641 --> 19:20.060
However, he is ill and can't
see to such problems.

19:20.475 --> 19:24.475
I've come to ask you to
solve the mysteries for us.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.060
It won't be easy.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.310
Serial killings can't be ruled out.

19:30.016 --> 19:33.435
I heard you are the best
in all of Joseon, sir.

19:36.516 --> 19:37.850
I'm not the best.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.641
I'm the best of the best!

19:43.516 --> 19:46.060
It's sad that I can only
explain myself that way.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.185
He's a little arrogant.

19:48.641 --> 19:49.391
I see.

19:49.435 --> 19:51.475
Let's talk accommodations.

19:51.516 --> 19:54.100
Will it have two rooms
or one with living room?

19:54.141 --> 19:55.810
One with living room, sir.

19:55.850 --> 19:57.975
Inside bathroom or outside?

19:58.016 --> 19:58.935
Inside, sir.

19:58.975 --> 19:59.891
And breakfast?

19:59.935 --> 20:01.141
Provided, sir.

20:01.225 --> 20:02.435

20:29.100 --> 20:33.516
I know who has it, sir.
Please give me a few more days.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.141
The guest door is that way.

21:49.435 --> 21:52.141
The owner's daughter asked me to come.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.350
I'm a detective.

21:53.391 --> 21:56.225
It's about the mysterious deaths here.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.641
Your sister asked us to
come and investigate.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.141
I don't know why she did that.

22:02.641 --> 22:04.391
I don't know of such things.

22:13.266 --> 22:14.516
I'm Kim Min.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.560
He's a very famous detective, sir.

22:23.600 --> 22:27.725
He solved the fake silver case and
even had dinner with the king.

22:31.435 --> 22:32.600
I don't think he knows.

22:33.516 --> 22:35.810
What if I explain it like this?

22:35.975 --> 22:38.641
He got drunk before His Majesty and said,

22:39.060 --> 22:41.060
'This isn't your country, pal!'

22:41.100 --> 22:44.225
After the rude fiasco,
he was sent into exile.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.725
That's him.

22:47.310 --> 22:49.766
He's Premier Kim Shin's...

22:50.310 --> 22:52.350
I'm Choi Jae-kyung. Please come inside.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.060
Or is it horse dung?

24:08.516 --> 24:09.935
What is this, a barn?

24:10.766 --> 24:13.185
It's not what she promised.

24:13.935 --> 24:17.641
The bathroom is so far! I
almost peed on the way!

24:18.185 --> 24:20.560
It's the busy season.

24:21.435 --> 24:23.850
It's perfect for a rude fool.

24:24.975 --> 24:29.350
And what's with this breakfast?

24:30.016 --> 24:32.850
Shouldn't they give us fried eggs at least?

24:33.850 --> 24:37.600
This is why you don't make
deals with a middleman.

24:40.185 --> 24:41.891
I'm taking a few towels when I leave.

24:42.225 --> 24:43.225
Sir?

24:45.350 --> 24:50.810
My sister asked you to come
without discussing with me.

24:50.935 --> 24:53.435
<i>CHOI IL-KYU
OWNER OF YEON-MI LODGE</i>

24:53.475 --> 24:55.225
What happened to your father?

24:55.266 --> 24:57.475
He's been like this for a month.

24:58.641 --> 25:02.350
Even the best doctors don't
know what is wrong with him.

25:02.391 --> 25:04.141
<i>A book on exorcism?</i>

25:04.516 --> 25:08.266
The magistrate is busy with the fest
and has no plans to investigate.

25:08.685 --> 25:11.475
When two men burned to
death by a peculiar fire...

25:11.850 --> 25:12.725
Two?

25:12.766 --> 25:14.516
When did this happen?

25:14.560 --> 25:17.060
A man died by the same fire last night.

25:17.100 --> 25:21.810
What is the Full Moon Fest that
the magistrate can't investigate?

25:21.850 --> 25:26.016
In the past, royal officials
would all gather to celebrate.

25:26.060 --> 25:28.600
His Majesty will be coming this time.

25:28.641 --> 25:31.641
The magistrate must want
to keep things quiet.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.560
Please catch the killer
before the Full Moon Fest.

25:37.310 --> 25:40.810
Just by me being here, the
killer is practically caught.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.100
Pardon?

25:43.560 --> 25:46.560
I'm called a detective and a shaman too.

25:46.600 --> 25:50.310
For I can find a killer just
by looking at the corpse,

25:50.350 --> 25:53.641
I'm like a possessed shaman who knows all.

25:54.975 --> 25:56.310
Shall we begin?

25:59.100 --> 26:00.225
Is he usually like that?

26:00.266 --> 26:04.016
Worse, sir. He must not be feeling well.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.725
Less bragging than usual.

26:17.641 --> 26:20.350
<i>POLICE SEEK DETAILS ON THIS MAN</i>

26:33.266 --> 26:35.310
- You know Sir Song Pil-geun?
- Yes.

26:35.350 --> 26:37.725
He was burned by the ghost fire!

26:37.766 --> 26:39.810
There's no such thing as a ghost fire!

26:39.850 --> 26:42.600
- His servant saw everything!
- What?

26:42.641 --> 26:45.725
The body burned, but he saw no fire!

26:45.766 --> 26:46.766
No way!

27:06.475 --> 27:07.266
Sir!

27:07.475 --> 27:08.475
Are you all right?

27:09.016 --> 27:11.060
You must've gone weak, sir.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.766
I thought you'd fly all the way back home.

27:14.516 --> 27:15.641
Don't exaggerate.

27:32.225 --> 27:34.725
- The footstep is...
- It's mine.

27:35.225 --> 27:36.225
Right.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.975
I knew that.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.641
Don't tamper with the crime scene!

27:41.685 --> 27:44.391
The burn mark looks like a man!

27:44.435 --> 27:46.766
Do you know what's the most painful death?

27:47.225 --> 27:48.850
Burning to death.

27:51.810 --> 27:56.935
But the way he died shows no
sign of squirming in pain.

27:57.475 --> 28:02.100
It means that he couldn't
move before he was burned.

28:04.685 --> 28:07.560
- An invisible fire...
- And...

28:07.601 --> 28:11.475
I know the killer always
returns to the crime scene.

28:11.891 --> 28:12.891
Sir?

28:13.225 --> 28:16.183
See the bamboo hat behind you?

28:16.266 --> 28:18.475
He keeps looking this way.

28:21.975 --> 28:23.016
Bamboo hat!

28:23.850 --> 28:25.435
You'll just hit me and go?

28:26.685 --> 28:27.685
How rude.

28:36.350 --> 28:37.350
Rude?

28:37.435 --> 28:38.435
Me?

28:38.683 --> 28:40.475
You hit me and didn't say sorry.

28:40.516 --> 28:44.850
Still, how dare you try
to touch my clothes?

28:45.766 --> 28:47.100
How dare I?

28:47.475 --> 28:49.100
How dare you!

28:49.141 --> 28:50.141
Wait!

28:51.016 --> 28:55.475
Mind your language!
Where are your manners?

28:55.516 --> 28:56.935
Stay out, servant.

28:56.975 --> 28:57.975
Servant?

29:00.100 --> 29:02.891
Hear that, sir? She called me a servant!

29:05.641 --> 29:06.641
Sir! Be careful!

29:08.560 --> 29:09.725
Are you all right, sir?

29:10.310 --> 29:11.560
I'll get you!

29:40.100 --> 29:41.185
Do you know me?

29:54.100 --> 29:55.185
The monk?

29:56.185 --> 29:58.600
The Buddhist monk on the poster?

29:58.641 --> 30:00.891
Did anyone come for his body?

30:01.475 --> 30:03.975
You're the first to come for him.

30:04.016 --> 30:07.725
So, all you know is that
he's a Buddhist monk?

30:07.766 --> 30:10.185
Why do you ask that?

30:10.810 --> 30:11.475
Very well then.

30:11.516 --> 30:14.560
Wait! Show me your identity tag!

30:22.435 --> 30:24.516
Who are you, sir?

30:24.560 --> 30:27.560
Didn't Sir Choi Jae-kyung mention us?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.060
You're the detective from the capital?

30:30.100 --> 30:30.810
Yes.

30:30.850 --> 30:33.225
There's no case I can't solve.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.225
- I'm the best detective in...
- Excuse me, sir.

30:35.685 --> 30:39.350
Where did she go?

30:41.685 --> 30:44.225
I wish to see Song Pil-geun's corpse.

30:44.266 --> 30:45.725
That's impossible, sir.

30:45.766 --> 30:48.560
The magistrate gave orders
never to show it to anyone.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.850
Of course not! If the magistrate said so.

30:54.935 --> 30:58.100
On second thought, maybe
he didn't say never.

30:58.141 --> 31:00.475
There is no such thing as never.

31:02.391 --> 31:05.310
- You could sneak a peek at night.
- Good.

31:05.435 --> 31:07.850
- I'll come back at night.
- Yes, sir.

31:11.310 --> 31:13.225
What did you draw, sir?

31:14.975 --> 31:18.641
Isn't she the woman from before?

31:19.350 --> 31:20.891
That lady...

31:21.516 --> 31:23.100
Did you notice?

31:23.516 --> 31:24.516
Well,

31:24.600 --> 31:27.310
she was a bit odd and very strong.

31:27.350 --> 31:28.391
She's gorgeous.

31:29.060 --> 31:30.435
Not again.

31:30.891 --> 31:33.435
Why draw a pretty woman
at a time like this?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.391
I need it to investigate.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.600
Investigate what?

31:37.100 --> 31:39.475
If you want to meet her, just say it.

31:39.516 --> 31:41.016
She's there wherever we go!

31:41.725 --> 31:45.766
That means she's connected
to this case somehow.

31:48.725 --> 31:50.141
- Then...
- Maybe...

31:50.850 --> 31:53.766
She could be chasing us.

31:54.891 --> 31:56.891
Us? Why, sir?

31:58.560 --> 31:59.810
Sir! It's me!

31:59.850 --> 32:03.641
You must find out who she is
and why she's after this case.

32:03.685 --> 32:05.141
Yes, sir.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.891
This rough chap looks suspicious.

32:11.266 --> 32:12.391
It's a woman.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.060
And she's pretty.

32:18.766 --> 32:20.560
Are you going blind in your old age?

32:22.435 --> 32:23.185
Forget it.

32:23.225 --> 32:25.810
I'll find her. You can go back home.

32:25.850 --> 32:26.850
No, sir!

32:27.141 --> 32:30.435
I'll find this fool! I mean this woman!

33:37.060 --> 33:38.225
Look.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.850
There is soot in his nose.

33:41.141 --> 33:43.141
He was burned when he was alive.

34:14.891 --> 34:18.141
It appears we're here for the same purpose.

34:23.266 --> 34:25.350
Would you like to take a look?

34:25.641 --> 34:28.685
Or shall we fight and bring in the guards?

34:44.891 --> 34:46.600
An invisible fire...

34:47.350 --> 34:52.975
It seems he was fatally
wounded before burning.

34:53.016 --> 34:55.850
Then the scar must be somewhere.

35:05.060 --> 35:08.016
<i>While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.</i>

35:08.060 --> 35:10.685
<i>The burnt one wasn't decayed at all.</i>

35:13.641 --> 35:16.185
<i>Only the burnt corpse vanished!</i>

35:44.141 --> 35:46.600
<i>Is it a real vampire?</i>

35:47.225 --> 35:50.016
<i>The arrow precisely struck the heart.</i>

35:50.725 --> 35:54.435
<i>He didn't just want the
blood, but to kill him.</i>

35:55.685 --> 35:57.185
<i>'Yeom' means to stain.</i>

35:58.350 --> 36:00.725
<i>Why did the killer leave a sign?</i>

36:01.560 --> 36:03.891
<i>Perhaps a forewarned murder?</i>

36:05.060 --> 36:08.060
This letter has something
to do with staining or dyes.

36:08.516 --> 36:12.185
Go to the painting plant and
meet the painters for clues.

36:12.685 --> 36:15.016
I'll search the dye house here.

36:20.266 --> 36:22.600
<i>HA BYUNG-EUN</i>

36:55.016 --> 36:56.435
Why are you here?

36:56.685 --> 36:58.641
How long will you follow me?

36:59.935 --> 37:02.850
I saw someone on fire too.

37:04.475 --> 37:05.475
Where?

37:07.975 --> 37:08.975
I'm not sure.

37:09.725 --> 37:14.100
I'm not sure where, who,
or why I remember that.

37:15.435 --> 37:19.810
He must've been killed by something
that looks human but is not.

37:22.435 --> 37:24.975
Something that looks human but is not?

37:25.975 --> 37:28.935
Are they really strong and fast?

37:29.685 --> 37:31.310
And heal fast if they're hurt?

37:32.185 --> 37:33.435
You know about vampires?

37:35.516 --> 37:36.850
Vampires?

37:38.225 --> 37:39.891
Vampires are immortal.

37:41.100 --> 37:45.016
They don't get hurt or die.

37:46.225 --> 37:47.475
Immortal?

39:44.350 --> 39:45.600
I have a question.

39:46.100 --> 39:48.350
You're definitely in my memory.

39:50.350 --> 39:51.560
Who am I?

39:53.975 --> 39:55.975
In becoming a monster,
your memory was lost.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.475
If you want your memory back,

40:00.560 --> 40:01.641
drink blood.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.100
Are you all right?

40:11.516 --> 40:12.516
You fool!

40:12.891 --> 40:16.391
How dare you disturb the
laws of this world!

40:16.810 --> 40:19.725
I know that you're behind
the ominous deaths!

40:19.766 --> 40:22.725
How dare you try to live
by killing innocent people!

40:23.225 --> 40:24.310
Innocent people?

40:25.475 --> 40:26.016
Who?

40:26.060 --> 40:27.141
How dare you!

40:27.435 --> 40:30.185
Think you can get away with
murder because you're immortal?

40:30.560 --> 40:33.350
I know how to banish you!

40:36.641 --> 40:38.060
Do you want to remember?

40:39.725 --> 40:40.975
Then watch this!

41:30.350 --> 41:32.600
Sir! What happened!

41:35.685 --> 41:38.685
We must get the arrow out.
Hold him down now!

41:42.225 --> 41:43.560
That's a good idea.

41:43.975 --> 41:46.810
But aren't we in the same class?
Stop giving me orders!

41:46.850 --> 41:47.850
Hurry up!

41:48.685 --> 41:51.766
I will, but watch it.

42:46.141 --> 42:47.141
Sir?

42:47.685 --> 42:49.641
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

42:54.310 --> 42:56.266
Isn't she odd, sir?

42:56.975 --> 42:58.516
Did you sense it too?

42:58.766 --> 42:59.766
You too, sir?

43:00.016 --> 43:01.016
Yes.

43:01.435 --> 43:05.516
I thought she was strange from the start.

43:06.310 --> 43:08.766
She goes around alone.

43:09.435 --> 43:12.350
She talks down to you and gives commands.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.266
She's out of this world, sir.

43:14.725 --> 43:17.266
It all adds up to one thing.

43:17.891 --> 43:18.891
What?

43:19.391 --> 43:20.600
She's crazy.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.350
Crazy girls don't wear flowers
on their heads these days.

43:26.310 --> 43:29.266
Try all you want, but you can't fool me!

43:35.225 --> 43:37.891
<i>If you want to remember, drink blood.</i>

43:48.475 --> 43:51.516
<i>She fought off a vampire. Is she one too?</i>

43:51.560 --> 43:53.516
<i>No, she's can't be.</i>

43:53.560 --> 43:56.310
<i>If she is, she can't be fine in the sun.</i>

43:56.350 --> 43:58.560
<i>And she wouldn't have saved me.</i>

43:58.600 --> 44:01.391
<i>If he catches the monster
before I find my memory...</i>

44:01.435 --> 44:03.516
<i>But she's similar to him.</i>

44:03.560 --> 44:07.060
<i>He's arrogant, but has a useful brain.</i>

44:07.100 --> 44:09.016
<i>She's quite arrogant.</i>

44:09.060 --> 44:11.641
<i>But her ability to fight
him is quite useful.</i>

44:11.685 --> 44:16.141
<i>With my brain and this woman's
body, we can catch the monster.</i>

44:16.185 --> 44:17.266
<i>Work with her?</i>

44:17.475 --> 44:18.641
<i>My brain and...</i>

44:19.185 --> 44:20.435
<i>Seo-pil's body!</i>

44:21.766 --> 44:22.685
Damn it!

44:22.725 --> 44:23.975
This woman's body!

44:26.891 --> 44:29.016
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

44:30.935 --> 44:32.766
It's not what it sounded like.

44:32.810 --> 44:35.100
- I mean your...
- If you help me,

44:35.725 --> 44:37.225
I'll help you catch the monster.

44:37.391 --> 44:38.225
But

44:38.266 --> 44:40.100
you can't ask anything about me.

44:40.725 --> 44:43.560
Agreed. But help you with what?

44:44.560 --> 44:48.016
I lost my memory.

44:49.891 --> 44:51.516
I want to know who I am.

44:52.266 --> 44:53.266
Fine.

44:53.435 --> 44:56.516
But there's one problem.

44:57.100 --> 44:57.891
What is it?

44:57.935 --> 44:59.100
You don't call me sir.

44:59.516 --> 45:00.641
Then don't call me ma'am.

45:00.685 --> 45:01.685
Really?

45:01.725 --> 45:02.725
That works.

45:04.185 --> 45:06.391
Wait. Maybe not.

45:07.141 --> 45:08.685
Is she really crazy?

45:09.185 --> 45:10.185
By the way,

45:11.435 --> 45:14.100
how did you know the dye maker would die?

45:15.100 --> 45:19.391
The arrowhead from Song's corpse
had a letter which means 'to stain'.

45:19.435 --> 45:24.141
My clever head figured out
it's a clue to his next killing...

45:27.850 --> 45:28.850
The arrowhead!

45:40.310 --> 45:45.141
Oh no! Brother!

45:45.266 --> 45:46.266
Who's that?

45:46.725 --> 45:48.766
- Must be the dead man's brother.
- What?

45:49.183 --> 45:51.725
He only has a younger sister.

45:57.185 --> 46:00.141
Right. He does.

46:01.475 --> 46:03.475
Then who am I?

46:03.516 --> 46:05.350
Well, I'm...

46:05.391 --> 46:07.016
I'm his sister.

46:28.141 --> 46:29.975
Then who is he?

46:31.225 --> 46:34.225
- Well, I'm her Hus...
- My servant.

46:35.185 --> 46:36.560
His name is Bang-ja.

46:39.725 --> 46:40.891
Greet me.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.100
Hello, ma'am.

46:46.310 --> 46:49.725
He's dressed in disguise to protect me.

46:51.560 --> 46:54.350
He will be examined soon. Please be quick.

46:54.391 --> 46:56.641
- Of course, sir.
- Let's go.

46:56.850 --> 46:58.185
Thank you, sir!

46:59.685 --> 47:00.685
A servant?

47:02.391 --> 47:04.685
Find the arrowhead, Bang-ja.

47:23.016 --> 47:24.100
Are you all right?

47:24.141 --> 47:28.641
Our lady lost consciousness
from the shock of his death!

47:30.060 --> 47:31.725
Oh no, ma'am!

47:40.600 --> 47:41.975
I'm fine. Put me down.

47:42.766 --> 47:43.766
No.

47:44.100 --> 47:46.935
Put me down! Let me off!

47:47.435 --> 47:49.475
Pretend you're asleep, will you?

47:49.810 --> 47:53.060
People will think it's odd if you don't.

48:00.141 --> 48:04.516
You really don't remember anything?

48:05.100 --> 48:07.016
I don't even know my name.

48:09.600 --> 48:11.641
Then let's make one.

48:13.766 --> 48:14.766
My name?

48:15.435 --> 48:17.975
We'll have to go around together like this.

48:18.641 --> 48:22.391
I can't just call you 'hey you'.

48:24.141 --> 48:27.141
And I'm an outstanding name maker.

48:27.891 --> 48:29.391
Listen and choose.

48:31.435 --> 48:36.310
Bertha, Dorcas, Edna, Gretel...

48:36.350 --> 48:38.310
Don't get cute with me.

48:43.516 --> 48:44.516
Let's see.

48:45.225 --> 48:47.475
Your fair skin is like the moon.

48:47.516 --> 48:51.810
'Wol' means 'moon'. And you're young.

48:52.310 --> 48:53.850
How about Wol-young?

48:55.141 --> 48:58.100
That's a pretty name.

49:05.266 --> 49:07.060
Simplified 'A-gyo'...

49:07.725 --> 49:10.516
It could mean someone
who makes ox hide glue.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.266
It could also mean shinbone.

49:13.350 --> 49:16.350
So, it could be a hunter or a butcher next.

49:16.685 --> 49:19.391
That's so weird.

49:21.350 --> 49:23.685
I haven't seen her eat in days.

49:25.310 --> 49:27.391
Even if your parents die, you feel hungry.

49:27.810 --> 49:29.391
Why won't she eat?

49:29.810 --> 49:32.185
I knew a crazy girl back home.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.475
She'd run around everywhere
without eating for almost a week.

49:36.975 --> 49:39.016
And you know how strong they are?

49:39.350 --> 49:41.810
They can drag a couple of men no problem!

49:42.641 --> 49:46.560
You should be careful, sir.

49:47.016 --> 49:50.060
Don't get involved because she's pretty.

49:50.891 --> 49:51.891
Hi.

49:52.310 --> 49:54.810
The flower suits you.

49:55.516 --> 49:56.810
Now, let's see you smile.

49:57.435 --> 49:58.435
Smile.

50:00.435 --> 50:03.935
Don't act pretty. Just
smile like the others.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.725
See? She's crazy.

50:10.266 --> 50:11.975
- Let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

50:28.600 --> 50:29.685
Hot! Hot!

51:17.725 --> 51:19.185
I'll protect you, sir!

51:41.975 --> 51:42.975
Stay still!

52:22.266 --> 52:23.310
Sir!

52:24.641 --> 52:26.016
What about me?

52:37.810 --> 52:38.850
Are you all right?

52:39.810 --> 52:40.810
I'm fine.

52:41.225 --> 52:43.435
You got cut. How could you be fine?

52:43.935 --> 52:45.475
- Let's see.
- It's okay.

52:45.516 --> 52:47.641
Don't be stubborn! Give me your hand.

53:04.850 --> 53:07.350
Who were those men?

53:08.975 --> 53:14.766
Why change subjects? You saw it.

53:17.060 --> 53:21.891
Some people can heal faster than others.

53:22.935 --> 53:24.350
What if I'm not human?

53:25.810 --> 53:30.016
What if I'm a monster like him?

53:37.310 --> 53:38.810
You're not a monster.

53:40.016 --> 53:43.016
Vampires can't last in the sun like you.

53:43.350 --> 53:46.600
They crave human blood, but you don't.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.391
So, you're not a monster.

53:50.391 --> 53:51.975
What do you know?

53:58.391 --> 54:01.891
I can't control my powers.

54:02.350 --> 54:05.850
I can even sense the air
passing through me.

54:06.516 --> 54:10.685
When I smell blood, I feel
a suffocating thirst.

54:11.935 --> 54:13.350
At this rate,

54:16.016 --> 54:19.016
I could bite your neck like that monster.

54:22.225 --> 54:26.350
You may become a monster after biting me,

54:26.516 --> 54:28.516
but my neck is fine.

54:29.100 --> 54:32.810
Your fear of becoming a monster
means you're not one yet.

54:33.891 --> 54:39.141
All I see is a good person who's
afraid of becoming a monster.

54:42.560 --> 54:44.060
Aren't you afraid of me?

54:45.475 --> 54:49.350
I trust the human in you, Wol-young.

54:51.016 --> 54:54.600
I trust you will not to become a monster.

54:55.560 --> 55:00.225
You're stronger and more
upright than any man.

55:00.266 --> 55:03.225
I'm not afraid of you.

55:03.350 --> 55:07.350
I'll always keep my neck open to you.

55:34.016 --> 55:36.766
Why don't you use the front gate?

55:38.310 --> 55:41.310
I searched throughout Ganghwa.
I can't find her, sir.

55:41.766 --> 55:42.810
This is...

55:48.185 --> 55:49.391
No sign at all?

55:51.600 --> 55:52.600
No, sir.

55:53.310 --> 55:54.810
I think she left Ganghwa.

55:55.435 --> 55:56.435
Give me that.

55:57.141 --> 55:58.141
Look.

56:00.766 --> 56:02.225
Still can't find her?

56:06.185 --> 56:08.100
Get it now?

56:08.141 --> 56:09.516
Have you seen her?

56:11.185 --> 56:13.685
Forget it. Go back home.

56:13.975 --> 56:15.560
No, sir. I'll stay and protect you.

56:15.600 --> 56:19.266
It's okay. Just take
good care of yourself.

56:19.310 --> 56:21.141
Then I'll be going, sir.

56:23.141 --> 56:25.185
- Use the gate!
- Yes, sir.

56:29.850 --> 56:30.850
Wait.

56:31.560 --> 56:34.641
Am I the monster in this book?

56:39.141 --> 56:40.766
Does this look like me?

56:41.391 --> 56:42.850
I don't look like this!

56:43.266 --> 56:45.016
My teeth are straight.

56:47.560 --> 56:53.935
And it says vampires burn in the sunlight.

56:55.350 --> 56:56.350
But I'm fine!

56:57.225 --> 57:01.560
That's for vampires who
sucked human blood.

57:04.685 --> 57:08.560
So, if I suck blood, I'd
be afraid of sunlight too?

57:11.391 --> 57:13.475
Vampires must drink blood to survive.

57:13.810 --> 57:17.310
If they don't, they'll go weak.

57:18.016 --> 57:19.016
Then

57:19.810 --> 57:21.060
they'll die!

57:24.060 --> 57:25.060
Look.

57:26.685 --> 57:28.060
You're scared of me, right?

57:32.310 --> 57:33.310
Yes.

57:33.891 --> 57:36.766
What's so funny here?

57:36.810 --> 57:38.891
I could hear you outside!

57:40.016 --> 57:41.766
Think of our history together!

57:41.810 --> 57:43.475
All those nights together!

57:44.016 --> 57:45.975
How can you ditch me for a crazy girl?

57:46.141 --> 57:49.600
You'll regret leaving me someday, sir!

57:51.266 --> 57:53.141
You're so lucky, bitch.

57:55.810 --> 58:00.141
If I ever bite someone, he'd be the first.

58:01.016 --> 58:02.016
By the way, sir.

58:02.060 --> 58:05.560
I must have menopause.

58:05.850 --> 58:08.391
I keep getting hot flashes.

58:08.435 --> 58:10.185
See? I'm burning inside!

58:11.350 --> 58:12.266
I'm hot! Get back!

58:12.310 --> 58:13.641
Don't do this!

58:13.685 --> 58:14.766
Get back, sir!

58:14.810 --> 58:16.725
What are you staring at?

58:16.766 --> 58:18.685
Get ready! We have to go!

58:20.060 --> 58:22.560
Don't be a burden on us.

58:23.641 --> 58:24.766
She won't budge.

58:24.810 --> 58:25.725
Why you!

58:25.810 --> 58:28.100
Stop! You're asking to die!

58:28.141 --> 58:29.810
What's with you, sir?

58:36.685 --> 58:37.810
What are you doing?

58:37.850 --> 58:39.016
Stop it, sir!

58:39.060 --> 58:40.516
Are you a pervert?

58:47.810 --> 58:49.560
What's wrong?

58:51.185 --> 58:52.975
Get away! Stop!

59:15.766 --> 59:20.141
Did it really say 'A-gyo' on the arrowhead?

59:20.725 --> 59:24.516
Why? You think I can't even read?

59:24.560 --> 59:25.891
Just let me see.

59:25.935 --> 59:30.810
No way! I'm mad you think I can't read!

59:30.850 --> 59:32.685
I'll bite you!

59:37.391 --> 59:39.641
It's a simplified character.

59:40.225 --> 59:43.310
Simplified characters were made to...

59:43.350 --> 59:44.516
Wol-gyo.

59:45.685 --> 59:47.435
You read it wrong.

59:47.766 --> 59:49.141
I knew it was Wol-gyo.

59:49.600 --> 59:51.016
Of course, I knew.

59:52.766 --> 59:54.935
I was right again.

59:56.475 --> 59:58.350
This pond is called Wol-gyo.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.016
Ganghwa Hall used to be here.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.641
Ganghwa Hall?

01:00:03.685 --> 01:00:07.516
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

01:00:07.975 --> 01:00:12.266
Then the next victim must
be connected to this place.

01:00:12.641 --> 01:00:17.391
If the fire here was plotted
to kill innocent lives,

01:00:18.185 --> 01:00:22.475
he's killing those
involved to get revenge?

01:00:22.935 --> 01:00:25.225
That ghastly fool!

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.225
He must have his reasons.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.141
The monster must've once been a human too.

01:00:41.225 --> 01:00:42.225
Like me.

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:48.641
There's sadness in his eyes.

01:00:56.516 --> 01:00:59.185
Didn't you lose your memory?

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.391
How do you know about Ganghwa Hall?

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.391
I'm not sure.

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:08.350
It just came to me.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:12.850
I saw Ganghwa Hall here.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.725
The arrowhead pointed to Ganghwa Hall?

01:01:42.475 --> 01:01:45.516
The next victim is connected
to the fire 30 years ago.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.225
Ask realtors and find out
why Ganghwa Hall is gone.

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.100
I'll investigate more on Ha Byung-eun.

01:02:00.435 --> 01:02:03.060
He must be Ha Byung-eun's father.

01:02:16.435 --> 01:02:20.810
Why hold a sacrifice instead of
wishing his son's spirit well?

01:02:58.225 --> 01:02:59.225
Nan?

01:03:05.475 --> 01:03:07.350
Have you forgotten?

01:03:10.435 --> 01:03:12.391
Did you think it was over?

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.600
You watched me die, but lived comfortably?

01:03:21.891 --> 01:03:25.435
Just as you murdered my wife and son,

01:03:26.225 --> 01:03:28.850
I'll destroy you and your family!

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.435
Forgive me!

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:38.185
I deserve to die!

01:04:16.475 --> 01:04:18.516
I couldn't protect you to the end.

01:04:19.516 --> 01:04:20.516
I'm sorry.

01:04:24.141 --> 01:04:25.141
Son!

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:34.935
- Ganghwa Hall?
- Yes.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.435
I heard Ganghwa Hall
burned down 30 years ago.

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:41.016
What happened?

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:43.935
It wasn't just a fire.

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:47.810
It was treason.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:49.475
Treason?

01:04:49.516 --> 01:04:55.060
They say that the Crown
Prince was poisoned there.

01:04:55.685 --> 01:05:01.225
So, the Jeong family was annihilated
and a pond was made there.

01:05:01.435 --> 01:05:05.850
The Jeong family owned Ganghwa Hall?

01:05:11.185 --> 01:05:12.975
He killed your son!

01:05:13.016 --> 01:05:14.185
Who is he?

01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:15.810
Jeong In-yul!

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.935
The Jeong family has been loyal
to the king for generations.

01:05:18.975 --> 01:05:22.725
Jeong In-yul and his father
were very loyal too.

01:05:23.516 --> 01:05:28.475
But they were executed
for plotting treason.

01:05:28.935 --> 01:05:30.060
Jeong In-yul...

01:05:30.891 --> 01:05:34.766
He's back from hell!

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:36.766
Jeong In-yul...

01:05:49.935 --> 01:05:50.935
A royal award?

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:54.766
For those who reported the
Crown Prince's murder?

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.935
Hong Jeong-ho, Song Gap-young, Ha Il-ju...

01:05:58.475 --> 01:05:59.475
Hong...

01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:01.685
Hong Tae-mun, Song Pil-geun, Ha Byung-eun!

01:06:02.435 --> 01:06:05.016
He killed the sons of those here in order!

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.225
There must be two more names.

01:06:07.641 --> 01:06:08.641
Choi Il-kyu?

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.766
- The owner of Yeon-mi Lodge?
- Yes.

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:15.685
The land and building
belonged to the Jeong family.

01:06:15.725 --> 01:06:19.060
But after they died, everything
went to Choi Il-kyu.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:23.266
Then the next target must
be his son, Jae-kyung.

01:06:23.685 --> 01:06:28.100
He knew his turn would come,
so he read up on monsters.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:29.685
Jeong In-yul...

01:06:30.185 --> 01:06:33.810
He's getting revenge on those
who reported the treason.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.560
Today's the 12th!

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.016
What about it, sir?

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.600
Hong Tae-mun died on the 3rd.

01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:43.891
Song died on the 6th.

01:06:43.935 --> 01:06:45.560
And Ha died on the 9th!

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.516
There's no time!

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.475
We can't fight a vampire
with our bare hands!

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.850
Then how do we stop it, sir?

01:06:57.225 --> 01:06:59.685
Strike it with silver or burn it!

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:04.060
If you don't burn its heart,
it could be revived with blood.

01:07:43.016 --> 01:07:45.516
The killer will come here tonight.

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:50.016
He has extraordinary skills
and won't be easy to fight.

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.810
You must shoot...

01:07:59.516 --> 01:08:01.725
You must shoot him with fiery arrows!

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.060
Yes, sir!

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640
Jeong In-yul!

01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:34.560
You and your father
poisoned the Crown Prince!

01:09:34.765 --> 01:09:37.390
But you want revenge?

01:09:37.765 --> 01:09:39.560
Rather than repent,

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.560
you took innocent lives!

01:09:41.935 --> 01:09:44.185
You will pay for your crime!

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:46.975
Pay for my crime?

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.850
You'll die here too!

01:10:15.266 --> 01:10:16.600
Pain, you say?

01:10:17.685 --> 01:10:19.975
What do you know about never-ending pain!

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:24.435
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

01:10:29.766 --> 01:10:30.935
Put him down.

01:10:35.016 --> 01:10:37.350
Though you seek blood now,

01:10:37.725 --> 01:10:40.225
were you not once a man of honor?

01:10:44.435 --> 01:10:46.391
Since your memory isn't back,

01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:49.935
you must not know how you died.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.350
Why?

01:10:55.225 --> 01:10:57.475
Think your death was different from mine?

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.266
When you remember how you
died and who killed you,

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:05.266
you'll become just like me.

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:06.310
No.

01:11:06.725 --> 01:11:08.641
I won't be a monster like you.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.560
Drink blood.

01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:14.435
Find your painful memories

01:11:14.475 --> 01:11:18.266
and get revenge on the
day of the full moon!

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.685
You must live!

01:12:26.766 --> 01:12:30.016
You want to turn me into a real vampire?

01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:35.185
Why did you try to give me blood?

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.391
I wanted to save you.

01:12:42.266 --> 01:12:43.266
Why?

01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:50.100
What if I bite you?

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.391
You'll become a vampire too.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.810
Do you wish to live on innocent blood?

01:12:57.310 --> 01:13:01.600
Even so, I would never drink
someone else's blood.

01:13:07.266 --> 01:13:10.975
Then I'll bite Seo-pil for you,
so you won't be lonely.

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:26.310
Being with the crazy girl,
you've lost your mind, sir.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.060
Yes, ma'am.

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.185
<i>SIR HA IL-JU AND CHOI IL-KYU DIED</i>

01:14:20.766 --> 01:14:25.475
<i>No warnings this time?
There must be another target.</i>

01:14:29.016 --> 01:14:30.766
Seo-pil? Wake up.

01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.725
Let me hold your hand.

01:14:33.185 --> 01:14:35.060
I said wake up!

01:15:03.141 --> 01:15:05.641
<i>I'll bite Seo-pil for you.</i>

01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:21.560
Get dressed, already!

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.935
Yes, sir.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.891
Someone will die in 3 days.

01:15:25.935 --> 01:15:28.266
We must find the last informer before then.

01:15:41.725 --> 01:15:44.766
Choi Il-kyu must have the royal award too.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.975
Why hide a proud certificate?

01:15:50.435 --> 01:15:52.560
Was he ashamed of it?

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.016
The full moon is in 3 days.

01:16:04.475 --> 01:16:06.725
It's when the spirits'
powers are the strongest!

01:16:06.766 --> 01:16:07.766
Wait!

01:16:08.391 --> 01:16:10.310
The Full Moon Fest...

01:16:11.225 --> 01:16:12.766
His Majesty will be here!

01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:13.810
Sir?

01:16:14.266 --> 01:16:15.641
Please run away.

01:16:16.725 --> 01:16:18.685
I can't protect you any longer!

01:16:33.516 --> 01:16:35.350
What do you fools want?

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:36.391
Sir!

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:40.141
Stay back. I'll handle them.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.100
But...

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.185
I'm immortal now, sir.

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:48.266
My body is on fire.

01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:50.766
I can't control my new powers!

01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:53.600
- Seo-pil! Actually...
- Listen!

01:16:53.641 --> 01:16:57.141
I'll have mercy and give you time to run.

01:16:57.185 --> 01:17:01.185
Or else today will be
your last day as humans!

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.725
Foolish thugs!

01:17:07.766 --> 01:17:12.100
I'll feast off your blood!

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.850
I drew the bite marks on you!

01:17:27.641 --> 01:17:29.475
You have what I want.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:33.100
If you give it to me, I'll go quietly.

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:40.310
This will help you decide.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600
Stop!

01:18:10.225 --> 01:18:15.016
When I awoke in the mountain,
a monk gave it to me.

01:18:16.685 --> 01:18:18.600
The case 30 years ago...

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:22.475
Maybe the perpetrators and
victims should be switched.

01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:26.266
Those thugs are trying to hide something!

01:18:26.685 --> 01:18:30.185
What did they want? What was inside?

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.185
It was a scroll with strange secret codes.

01:18:37.225 --> 01:18:38.225
Secret codes?

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:42.685
My clever brain would've solved it!

01:18:42.725 --> 01:18:44.016
What a pity.

01:18:44.891 --> 01:18:45.891
Dang!

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.975
- Why you little!
- What?

01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:49.185
I remember!

01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:03.060
Secret codes are written
with certain patterns.

01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:05.975
If you find the pattern, it can be read.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.100
Where's that clever brain of yours?

01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:22.310
Huh, sir?

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.100
I knew it!

01:19:52.891 --> 01:19:53.891
I was wrong.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.185
Could you write up another one?

01:20:00.641 --> 01:20:02.600
Right here! Just bite him!

01:20:16.725 --> 01:20:17.975
Get back, sir.

01:20:20.391 --> 01:20:21.975
You're confusing me!

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:33.810
Wait!

01:20:33.975 --> 01:20:36.016
They used Korean alphabet!

01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:44.225
The 1st and 3rd lines are consonants
written with vertical symmetry.

01:20:44.266 --> 01:20:48.060
The middle line has vowels
drawn with triangles.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.016
The circles mean 'A'.
The triangles mean 'O' or 'U'.

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.810
Circles with lines mean 'E' and so on.

01:21:01.725 --> 01:21:05.975
<i>POISON THE CROWN PRINCE AND FRAME
JEONG IN-YUL AND HIS FATHER</i>

01:21:06.685 --> 01:21:07.685
I knew it!

01:21:09.475 --> 01:21:12.685
Those who reported the treason
were the real traitors!

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.141
What do you mean?

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.975
It's a conspiracy pact.

01:21:17.016 --> 01:21:19.725
The Crown Prince's death was fabricated!

01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:22.016
Those who poisoned him

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:26.100
framed it on Jeong In-yul
and his father as treason!

01:21:28.641 --> 01:21:31.810
So, Jeong In-yul is
getting revenge on them?

01:21:32.266 --> 01:21:34.516
What do you know about never-ending pain!

01:21:34.975 --> 01:21:37.141
I don't know how he became a vampire.

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.435
But by killing the traitors' sons,

01:21:39.766 --> 01:21:42.725
he wanted them to suffer
more pain than death.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.975
He'll kill the last traitor's son next!

01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:49.225
Song Gap-young.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.225
Ha Il-ju.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.016
Choi Il-kyu.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.435
And

01:21:54.475 --> 01:21:55.725
Kim...

01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:59.891
And who, sir?

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:03.225
Kim Shin?

01:22:04.516 --> 01:22:05.516
Kim Shin?

01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:08.310
Your father, sir?

01:22:10.435 --> 01:22:12.435
Jeong In-yul knew me.

01:22:12.935 --> 01:22:16.435
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:19.266
He knows I'm the last informer's son.

01:22:22.185 --> 01:22:23.350
Kim Shin?

01:22:39.975 --> 01:22:42.310
What brings you here, Min?

01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:27.141
Give me blood.

01:23:29.225 --> 01:23:30.225
I want...

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:33.641
blood.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.685
The subjects are watching.

01:24:00.266 --> 01:24:01.266
Let them.

01:24:02.685 --> 01:24:05.975
I should hold my beloved's
hand on a night like this.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:08.766
Mother!

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.391
Father!

01:24:11.685 --> 01:24:12.725
Prince!

01:24:13.225 --> 01:24:15.560
Our son must've had a bad dream.

01:24:22.435 --> 01:24:26.185
What happened 30 years ago?

01:24:29.475 --> 01:24:33.391
Jeong In-yul is the one who called me here.

01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:35.975
Jeong In-yul died!

01:24:36.016 --> 01:24:39.266
I saw it with my own eyes!

01:24:39.725 --> 01:24:43.641
If you don't tell me,
I'll hear it from him.

01:24:44.185 --> 01:24:45.516
I did it for you!

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.560
Did you make a wish?

01:24:52.435 --> 01:24:53.435
Yes, sir.

01:24:53.725 --> 01:24:56.225
I wished for His Majesty's

01:24:56.266 --> 01:24:58.685
<i>JEONG IN-YUL</i>
quick recovery, Your Highness.

01:25:03.935 --> 01:25:05.850
You make me an unfilial son.

01:25:05.891 --> 01:25:08.310
How is that so, Your Highness?

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:13.475
The world knows you tend to
His Majesty every night.

01:25:13.516 --> 01:25:16.310
I just did what a subject should.

01:25:17.766 --> 01:25:18.766
I was kidding.

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.310
Your Highness?

01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:25.516
What did you wish for?

01:25:27.975 --> 01:25:29.350
I wished for Joseon

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.975
to be returned to its owner.

01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:37.060
Joseon belongs to His Majesty and you, sir.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:41.310
A king should not be the
owner of a country.

01:25:42.391 --> 01:25:45.475
The people should be.

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:49.685
Joseon doesn't belong to the people now.

01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:54.310
Those who must work for
the people rule them.

01:25:54.725 --> 01:25:57.475
They make factions and fight
to keep what's theirs.

01:25:57.766 --> 01:26:00.641
They try to control the
king and alienate others.

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:03.725
They frame their opposers as traitors.

01:26:06.185 --> 01:26:08.060
They're the ones who own Joseon.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.975
When I become king,

01:26:14.391 --> 01:26:18.141
I'll take Joseon away from them
and give it back to the people.

01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:22.266
I trust you will, sir.

01:26:25.016 --> 01:26:26.850
See the lanterns?

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:30.850
Do you know what the people wished for?

01:26:32.641 --> 01:26:34.975
The people make small cries.

01:26:35.435 --> 01:26:38.016
It's their leaders who raise their voices.

01:26:43.435 --> 01:26:47.310
Joseon doesn't need people
to talk for the civilians.

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.516
We need people to listen
to their small cries.

01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:59.975
I want to make it so that civilians
will not suffer from hunger and pain.

01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:06.891
Did you find anything?

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:13.685
It's been long since I
sent you to Ganghwa Hall.

01:27:14.435 --> 01:27:16.350
Promise me first, sir.

01:27:16.391 --> 01:27:17.975
You found a way?

01:27:18.725 --> 01:27:19.725
Tell me.

01:27:21.516 --> 01:27:22.935
Why are you hesitating?

01:27:23.475 --> 01:27:28.185
Do you wish to see your
entire family be annihilated?

01:27:38.266 --> 01:27:39.141
What is it?

01:27:39.185 --> 01:27:41.100
The Crown Prince has passed away!

01:27:41.141 --> 01:27:42.141
What?

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560
But how?

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.600
Sir! Sir!

01:27:48.141 --> 01:27:50.391
Please run away! Your
father's been arrested!

01:27:50.435 --> 01:27:51.435
My father? Why?

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:53.935
That he poisoned His Highness...

01:27:53.975 --> 01:27:55.266
That's preposterous!

01:28:00.725 --> 01:28:02.810
Your Highness! You must leave at once.

01:28:03.266 --> 01:28:04.560
What do you mean?

01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:06.391
Where is His Highness?

01:28:09.725 --> 01:28:12.225
The young prince is in danger.
Please change.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:19.600
Let's go.

01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:22.891
Where are you going?

01:28:22.935 --> 01:28:26.350
You know very well that my
father would never do this.

01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:27.475
He's been framed!

01:28:27.516 --> 01:28:31.391
Those who killed His Highness
will be after the prince.

01:28:44.516 --> 01:28:45.516
Your Highness!

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.975
Please follow me.

01:30:05.391 --> 01:30:06.391
Your Highness?

01:30:06.435 --> 01:30:07.475
Please sit here.

01:30:12.016 --> 01:30:14.060
They won't come here.

01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:17.850
Thank you.

01:30:19.766 --> 01:30:22.016
How could you come in here?

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.810
Haven't you heard about this ship?

01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:25.141
It's a revolt.

01:30:25.391 --> 01:30:28.850
We must protect the prince
until things settle down.

01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:36.225
In-yul!

01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:37.310
Run away!

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.850
Protect them no matter what!

01:30:45.935 --> 01:30:46.935
Hurry!

01:30:51.935 --> 01:30:54.350
But it's treason, sir! I can't do it.

01:30:54.391 --> 01:30:55.391
You fool!

01:30:56.725 --> 01:30:58.185
It's not treason.

01:30:59.141 --> 01:31:02.641
The Crown Prince becoming king is treason!

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:08.810
He's filled with absurd ideals!
If he becomes king, Joseon will fall!

01:31:09.766 --> 01:31:13.016
<i>A country does not thrive on ideals alone!</i>

01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:20.350
<i>The only way to save your family
is to bring down the Crown Prince!</i>

01:31:31.935 --> 01:31:33.225
What are you doing?

01:31:38.725 --> 01:31:39.725
Please...

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.350
Please let the prince live?

01:31:55.685 --> 01:31:56.810
Open the door.

01:31:57.141 --> 01:31:58.725
Open it now!

01:31:59.641 --> 01:32:02.975
Just let the prince live!

01:32:03.016 --> 01:32:05.810
Please save the prince!

01:32:06.516 --> 01:32:07.516
No!

01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.141
It would've been better to
die than to beg for life.

01:32:17.266 --> 01:32:18.266
You fool!

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:23.225
If I didn't do that, our family
would've been annihilated!

01:32:23.766 --> 01:32:27.266
I abandoned my friend and the Crown Prince

01:32:27.766 --> 01:32:29.310
to save you!

01:32:32.016 --> 01:32:35.935
You mean, this is all because of me?

01:32:36.725 --> 01:32:38.975
You did all that for me?

01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:42.185
Then what makes me different
from the monster?

01:32:42.810 --> 01:32:46.935
I lived well in a family that
thrived on innocent blood!

01:32:46.975 --> 01:32:49.016
Then I'm a monster too!

01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:07.935
Scour the area!

01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:10.060
Yes, sir!

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:21.141
Prince...

01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:24.141
You must survive.

01:33:25.975 --> 01:33:27.060
Search there!

01:33:50.935 --> 01:33:52.016
Find them!

01:34:04.685 --> 01:34:05.975
Don't let them get away!

01:34:14.435 --> 01:34:16.100
Corner her and catch her!

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.850
Mother?

01:34:37.891 --> 01:34:43.225
If snow falls before the balsam fades,

01:34:43.266 --> 01:34:47.641
I heard you can meet the one you miss.

01:34:48.225 --> 01:34:49.350
Prince?

01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:52.391
Where did you hear that?

01:34:52.435 --> 01:34:59.141
It doesn't matter for
me if the balsam fades.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.600
Why?

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.891
Even if you can't meet the one you miss?

01:35:04.016 --> 01:35:08.766
I'll live with you and Father forever.

01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:11.891
I won't miss anyone.

01:35:34.685 --> 01:35:36.516
You were Sun...

01:35:41.475 --> 01:35:43.600
My son, Sun...

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.891
I didn't even hold your hand.

01:35:54.935 --> 01:35:56.560
You died...

01:36:00.225 --> 01:36:03.225
before even calling me mother.

01:36:08.016 --> 01:36:09.475
I'm sorry.

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.725
I'm so sorry.

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:30.310
Your Highness!

01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:31.850
I, Jeong In-yul,

01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:35.560
was disloyal in being
deceived by a greedy friend.

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:39.935
I will punish him for harming
the Crown Prince and prince.

01:36:43.141 --> 01:36:48.225
I'll burn everything he
owns once and for all!

01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:52.435
He will come tomorrow
during the Full Moon Fest.

01:36:52.935 --> 01:36:54.766
That puts His Majesty in harms way!

01:36:55.141 --> 01:36:56.850
We must reveal everything.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.016
Even if I must die,

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.266
I'll reveal your crimes, Father!

01:37:08.225 --> 01:37:10.600
Lock him away at once!

01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:00.850
Sir!

01:38:02.141 --> 01:38:03.185
Stay back!

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.935
<i>I'm their owner's son.
They'll never harm me.</i>

01:38:11.475 --> 01:38:13.310
Stay back or else!

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.600
This sir...

01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:16.850
This fool is dead!

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:19.060
I said stay back!

01:38:22.391 --> 01:38:23.516
My toe!

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.810
- Are you all right?
- I have gout!

01:39:00.185 --> 01:39:01.185
Giddy up!

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:02.435
Giddy up!

01:39:03.766 --> 01:39:04.766
Giddy up!

01:39:34.141 --> 01:39:35.141
Giddy up!

01:39:37.266 --> 01:39:38.560
What are you doing?

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.560
I'll protect you! Grab the reins!

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:42.560
Seo-pil!

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:57.185
My gout!

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.641
Were you scared?

01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:03.310
Scared people will disdain
you if they own Joseon?

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.810
Scared you'll lose everything?

01:42:12.475 --> 01:42:17.891
Scared my young son will
live and reveal your sins?

01:42:47.685 --> 01:42:49.141
I've been waiting.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.475
I could strike you in the heart.

01:42:55.516 --> 01:42:58.310
Please don't hesitate, Wol-young.

01:43:00.391 --> 01:43:05.060
You must be so angry to
have to come back like this.

01:43:06.435 --> 01:43:07.685
I must die

01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:11.810
so your anger can be
resolved in the least bit.

01:43:13.225 --> 01:43:18.725
I hope this will pay for
some of my father's sins.

01:43:19.475 --> 01:43:22.060
Your father did not
only take away my life,

01:43:23.685 --> 01:43:25.560
but my son and husband too.

01:43:26.685 --> 01:43:31.516
We just wanted to be together.

01:43:33.725 --> 01:43:35.435
That's all we wanted.

01:43:36.975 --> 01:43:37.975
But

01:43:38.766 --> 01:43:42.560
you enjoyed the last 30 years
upon their unjust deaths.

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.185
You ask me to kill you?

01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:49.100
Fine.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.935
I'll kill you again and again!

01:44:08.016 --> 01:44:10.100
<i>I want to know who I am.</i>

01:44:10.766 --> 01:44:15.225
<i>Perhaps you lived in the distant past.</i>

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.016
Maybe 100 years ago?

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:18.685
That long?

01:44:19.766 --> 01:44:21.100
Then I'd be so old.

01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:23.185
Shall I call you granny?

01:44:23.225 --> 01:44:25.935
No! I'd rather be called a monster.

01:45:52.435 --> 01:45:54.185
It was exactly 30 years ago.

01:45:54.850 --> 01:45:57.391
Trying to save you, I became a monster.

01:45:58.225 --> 01:45:59.225
But you!

01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:03.560
To fill your filthy mouth,
you killed the Crown Prince!

01:46:04.141 --> 01:46:05.935
And my father and I!

01:46:09.975 --> 01:46:10.975
Jeong In-yul!

01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:21.185
I know the truth to your unjust suffering!

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:25.141
I'll reveal everything, so stop this!

01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:27.350
The truth?

01:46:28.391 --> 01:46:29.310
That's right!

01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:30.350
Tonight!

01:46:31.975 --> 01:46:36.560
The truth will burn you alive!

01:46:59.016 --> 01:47:00.016
No!

01:47:11.141 --> 01:47:13.266
Die you evil monster!

01:47:18.725 --> 01:47:20.641
You call me a monster?

01:47:23.016 --> 01:47:25.516
After knowing what your father did to me?

01:47:25.810 --> 01:47:29.016
How dare you call me a monster?

01:47:29.435 --> 01:47:30.766
30 years ago,

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:35.310
you became a monster to save a friend.

01:47:36.435 --> 01:47:37.475
But now!

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:42.100
You kill innocent people for revenge!

01:47:42.475 --> 01:47:44.600
And threaten His Majesty's life!

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.891
You're just a monster!

01:48:02.391 --> 01:48:03.516
Now, die!

01:48:14.685 --> 01:48:15.766
Your Highness!

01:48:16.935 --> 01:48:18.516
You've done enough.

01:48:18.766 --> 01:48:19.891
No, Your Highness!

01:48:20.475 --> 01:48:23.141
He must die to finish my revenge.

01:48:27.685 --> 01:48:30.641
Those who made us into
monsters are all dead.

01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:33.435
Stop.

01:48:36.225 --> 01:48:37.560
It's over now.

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:46.685
I don't know how to stop.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.560
My father is still alive in my heart.

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:57.141
His Highness and the prince
must be alive in you too!

01:48:57.391 --> 01:49:01.100
I can't stop here.

01:49:26.891 --> 01:49:29.016
You know very well

01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:33.560
that we should not have come back to life.

01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:38.935
We're just monsters who crave human blood.

01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:45.185
Though we've gotten our revenge,

01:49:47.725 --> 01:49:50.935
we can only live on the
blood of innocent people.

01:49:54.016 --> 01:49:55.725
We've done enough.

01:49:57.225 --> 01:49:58.891
It's time to go.

01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:11.810
I, Jeong In-yul,

01:50:13.016 --> 01:50:15.100
shall go to the Crown Prince first.

01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:20.516
Forgive me, Your Highness.

01:51:05.891 --> 01:51:06.766
Your Highness!

01:51:06.810 --> 01:51:07.975
Please go inside!

01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:33.850
What is time?

01:51:33.891 --> 01:51:36.391
Please hide from the sunlight!

01:51:39.475 --> 01:51:44.560
Waiting is only possible in time.

01:51:54.975 --> 01:51:57.725
But the balsam stain remains...

01:52:01.435 --> 01:52:04.266
Will I meet the ones I miss?

01:53:10.185 --> 01:53:12.060
I missed you so much.

01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:46.641
30 years ago,

01:53:46.975 --> 01:53:51.850
Kim Shin poisoned the Crown Prince
and framed the Jeong family.

01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:55.435
Thus, seize all his assets and servants.

01:53:55.766 --> 01:53:59.891
Although his son revealed everything,

01:54:00.185 --> 01:54:06.516
Kim Min must also be
beheaded to uphold the law!

01:54:16.435 --> 01:54:18.810
<i>A MONTH LATER</i>

01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:33.141
I heard you've gone a little cuckoo.

01:54:33.475 --> 01:54:34.766
Maybe a lot.

01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:43.060
He's coming! He's coming for me!

01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:45.935
Who? Who's coming for you?

01:54:46.975 --> 01:54:48.516
He came in my dreams.

01:54:49.391 --> 01:54:51.766
He said he's coming for me!

01:54:52.766 --> 01:54:55.560
So weak for a young fellow.

01:55:04.516 --> 01:55:06.266
If you're a man, state your name!

01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:08.266
If you're a ghost, go away!

01:55:16.685 --> 01:55:17.685
It's me!

01:55:28.435 --> 01:55:30.310
I waited so long.

01:55:39.766 --> 01:55:40.766
Your Majesty!

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.060
You're already dead.

01:55:47.141 --> 01:55:50.310
Kim Min no longer exists in Joseon.

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:58.810
There are many things you
must do for me in secret.

01:56:01.391 --> 01:56:04.350
What did His Majesty command?

01:56:04.766 --> 01:56:06.475
A month ago, in Andong,

01:56:06.766 --> 01:56:10.685
the dead started to come
back to life and eat people.

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.185
Man-eating dead?

01:56:12.225 --> 01:56:13.225
Yes!

01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:15.685
They exist but do not.

01:56:15.891 --> 01:56:19.850
They are called zombies.

01:56:20.225 --> 01:56:21.225
Oh really?

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:23.060
Good luck!

01:56:23.185 --> 01:56:25.435
Wait! Come with me!

01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:39.350
<i>KIM Myung-min, OH Dal-soo,
