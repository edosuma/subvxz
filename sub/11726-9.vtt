00:14.415 --> 00:18.350
Arnold's voice:
<i>"Dear Mr. Anderson,</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.652
<i>I've recently obtained
command of West Point...</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:24.123
<i>our fortress
which guards the Hudson</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:26.325
<i>from British vessels
sailing upriver.</i>

00:26.327 --> 00:29.294
<i>For the time being,
not only its fortifications,</i>

00:29.296 --> 00:32.497
<i>but its troops are in pitiful
and wretched condition."</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:35.200
Clean yourself up, lad.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.137
Arnold's voice: <i>"I'm prepared to hand
it to you</i> lock, stock, and barrel.

00:38.139 --> 00:42.574
But only if my conditions
are met."

00:42.576 --> 00:43.475
West Point.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.478
They gave Arnold West Point?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.147
So what does he want?

00:48.149 --> 00:51.517
10,000 and a kiss on the cheek?

00:51.519 --> 00:54.286
20,000 plus indemnification
for his property

00:54.288 --> 00:56.355
and command of
a Loyalist battalion.

00:56.357 --> 01:00.626
20,000 pounds? I can
buy an army for that.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.595
With West Point,
you won't need one.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.532
<i>Supplies of meat for the rebel army are
held on the east side of the river,</i>

01:06.534 --> 01:09.068
<i>supplies of bread on the west.</i>

01:09.070 --> 01:11.837
<i>If we control the highlands,
Washington will be forced to fight</i>

01:11.839 --> 01:14.706
<i>or disband his army
for want of provisions.</i>

01:14.708 --> 01:18.477
This is our victory, sir.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.549
I'll go to 10,000,
but not a penny more.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.350
Make that clear in your reply.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.688
There'll be no reply.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.125
He requests a face-to-face
meeting with an officer

01:33.127 --> 01:36.395
as he finds a mutual confidence
between us is wanting.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.530
( scoffs )
Well, he got that right.

01:38.532 --> 01:42.201
He sent this ring
of which he has the twin.

01:44.138 --> 01:47.573
And that way he'll recognize...

01:47.575 --> 01:49.174
the man we send.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.216
- And who are you?
- Colonel Jameson, sir.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.218
I recently served
as General Howe's deputy.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.154
I see. So you're the one in
charge of this riffraff.

02:02.156 --> 02:06.458
Find this officer an outpost
that may suit him better.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.593
Sir!

02:07.595 --> 02:11.830
I have always been stationed
here at the fort.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.332
Not anymore.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.434
Perhaps you'll do
a better job downriver.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.902
And in the meantime, I'll expect

02:16.904 --> 02:20.172
an observation report
each morning without fail.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.207
You can't be serious.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.343
If he hands you paper
in enemy territory,

02:24.345 --> 02:26.311
you can be hanged as a spy.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.613
I won't accept any documents.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.448
And I'll be wearing
my uniform at all times.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.250
We'll meet under flag of truce

02:31.252 --> 02:33.318
to discuss a prisoner
exchange or something.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.921
- John...
- And don't think of it as enemy territory.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.456
It's Arnold's territory.

02:37.458 --> 02:41.460
<i>The Lord protected Daniel
in the lions' den.</i>

02:41.462 --> 02:45.697
<i>And at West Point,
Arnold is the lord.</i>

02:49.370 --> 02:51.303
From headquarters, sir.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.780
Bad news, sir?

03:03.651 --> 03:07.252
Seems General Washington will be
crossing the Hudson at King's Ferry

03:07.254 --> 03:09.188
and will be joining us
with guests.

03:09.190 --> 03:12.457
Oh, an honor. I'll ready
Robinson House immediately.

It's very important
you tell the truth.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.014
I beg you, Captain.
I've done nothing wrong.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.016
That's not what
I've heard, Elias.

04:11.018 --> 04:15.354
Naughty, naughty. And with
your own sister, too.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.521
How did you know about that?

04:16.523 --> 04:18.457
I know everything.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.791
Between the thieving,
the cheating,

04:19.793 --> 04:21.726
and the alleged incest,

04:21.728 --> 04:24.296
Setauket
is Sodom-On-the-Sea.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.032
And Robert Rogers has been
using the town's dirty secrets

04:27.034 --> 04:29.034
to blackmail folk
into sheltering him.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.271
Please, sir, about my
sister, it's a slander.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.039
I don't even know Rogers.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.408
I've never seen the
man, I swear it.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.548
I believe you.

04:47.655 --> 04:51.723
- Burn it all!
- Elias: <i> Wait.</i>

04:51.725 --> 04:53.759
I'm afraid you must
serve as a warning

04:53.761 --> 04:57.596
to those who are guilty
of harboring an outlaw.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.864
Elias:
<i>No, wait!</i>

04:58.866 --> 05:01.066
- ( animals screaming )
- Elias: <i> Please, no!</i>

05:01.068 --> 05:02.401
<i>( Elias shouts )</i>

05:02.403 --> 05:04.636
( crowd murmuring )

05:15.416 --> 05:18.483
<i>( insects chirping )</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:20.319
Simcoe is on a bloody rampage.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.587
Yours is the third one
he's burned this week.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.891
Someone better give up this Rogers
fellow or there won't be anything left.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.794
Elias: <i>There's nothing</i>
to be done, Isaac.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.796
<i>It's God's will.</i>

05:31.799 --> 05:33.965
God helps those
who help themselves.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.371
There's always
something to be done.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.605
Like what?

05:40.708 --> 05:43.875
Well, Oliver Cromwell
chopped off

05:43.877 --> 05:46.511
King Charles' head to
restore liberty, didn't he?

05:49.783 --> 05:53.385
Simcoe's also a tyrant
and we have a right,

05:53.387 --> 05:57.356
a divine right
to topple tyrants.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.124
Cromwell had an army.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.926
We don't even have
a musket to our name.

06:00.928 --> 06:04.996
That's because our guns are locked
in the church right up that hill.

06:07.368 --> 06:10.969
What do the Germans say
in Pennsylvania?

06:12.506 --> 06:16.108
Without gunpowder,
there is no freedom.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.155
<i>( knocking at door )</i>

06:30.157 --> 06:31.923
<i>( door opens )</i>

06:31.925 --> 06:34.159
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

06:34.161 --> 06:36.795
Sir, you have a caller.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.163
Not again.
Send her away.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.699
<i>It's Major Hewlett, sir.</i>

06:40.701 --> 06:43.602
- Who?
- Major Hewlett from Setauket.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.221
Tell him I'm too busy
to receive him.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.839
Abigail, tell the major
it should only take a moment

06:48.842 --> 06:52.444
and would be well worth
his time to reconsider.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.785
My apologies, Edward. I didn't
know you were in York City.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.988
Edmund, and I've been here
for over a month now.

07:05.559 --> 07:09.494
Yes, of course. It's just
that I'm on the way out.

07:09.496 --> 07:12.831
So am I. My ship leaves for
England tomorrow morning.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.468
I see your bloodhound
Captain Simcoe

07:16.470 --> 07:17.869
has not made you aware of this,

07:17.871 --> 07:20.772
likely because he intends
to see me off in his own way.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.741
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.209
Well, you should be.

07:24.211 --> 07:28.647
Afraid, that is,
of what you don't know.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.682
Take, for instance,
the rebel spy

07:30.684 --> 07:32.984
that has been operating
right under your nose.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.820
May I?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.056
I know all about that.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.991
My bloodhound, as you call him,

07:39.993 --> 07:43.528
is out hunting for Robert
Rogers as we speak.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.996
Now, I really must be going.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.766
Rogers is not Culper.

07:50.237 --> 07:55.106
Though I do believe you are familiar
with the man who really is.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.875
Who?

08:00.247 --> 08:02.948
You've been in the city
for more than a month.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.618
Why have you waited till now

08:06.620 --> 08:08.687
to communicate this?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.756
Every subject's duty
is the king's.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.726
But every subject's soul is his.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.262
I've been in the city
for over a month

08:17.264 --> 08:20.031
and not once have you
invited me to dine.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.601
I have offered my services
time and again

08:22.603 --> 08:24.002
and have been met with silence.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.705
You have never listened
to the Oyster Major before

08:26.707 --> 08:29.708
and I doubt
that you will start now.

08:29.710 --> 08:33.812
But that, sir, will not
stop me from doing my duty

08:33.813 --> 08:35.881
one last time.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.689
Culper is a cabbage farmer
named Abraham Woodhull.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.792
If I'm not mistaken, he attended

08:47.794 --> 08:50.161
one of your exclusive
little dinner parties...

08:51.698 --> 08:53.098
right here.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.802
God save the king.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.041
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

09:05.679 --> 09:07.646
Andrés voice:
<i>"To General Clinton,</i>

09:07.648 --> 09:09.748
<i>following my investigation
of the matter,</i>

09:09.750 --> 09:13.051
<i>I can conclusively report
that Agent Culper</i>

09:13.053 --> 09:16.121
<i>is Abraham Woodhull
of Setauket."</i>

09:18.058 --> 09:20.325
Send that with a courier
first thing tomorrow morning.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.060
Yes, sir.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.203
( chatter )

09:44.585 --> 09:47.085
- John.
- Whatever it is, I don't have time.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.590
Make time.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.126
- I think not, my dear.
- I'm not lying.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.063
Nor am I any happier
about this than you are.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.664
I've got my own career
to worry about.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.032
- We'll talk about this later.
- When?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.734
Tomorrow.
I have business upriver

10:02.736 --> 10:04.035
and I am late for my boat.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.271
John, don't.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.608
Please, don't go.

10:09.610 --> 10:13.712
I will take care of this.
I will.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.681
But I can't do it on my own.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.284
Stay with me?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.086
I said tomorrow.

10:27.361 --> 10:32.097
- The Vulture, eh?
- That's the name of the ship.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.265
I saw him step on board
at the west docks.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.268
Oh, so Andrés leaving the nest

10:37.270 --> 10:40.005
and flying upstream.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.806
Well, if he's coming
back tomorrow,

10:41.808 --> 10:46.011
that means his business
is tonight.

10:46.013 --> 10:50.181
You done well,
my sweet hummingbird.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.019
What will you do with him?

10:54.021 --> 10:55.887
Him?

10:55.889 --> 10:58.256
Justice, my lady.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.292
For you and for me

11:01.294 --> 11:04.396
and for all of us

11:04.398 --> 11:07.966
left out there in the shadows.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.189
<i>( door opens )</i>

Your Excellency.

- Thank you, General.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.063

11:38.065 --> 11:40.198

11:42.002 --> 11:44.269
I believe you're acquainted
with Major Tallmadge.

My heartfelt congratulations
to you, madam.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.306
<i>Sir.</i>

11:48.308 --> 11:50.241
Allow me to introduce
my aide-de-camp,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.444
Colonel Alexander Hamilton,

11:52.446 --> 11:54.879
who was not with us
in Philadelphia.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.215
- To my tremendous regret.
- Colonel.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.883
And this is...

11:58.885 --> 12:01.086
Le Marquis de Lafayette?

12:01.088 --> 12:03.054
Your fame precedes you,
monsieur.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.190
Oh, not as much as yours, madam.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.326
You must know that your beauty is
spoken of in every salon in Paris,

12:08.328 --> 12:11.096
indeed at the court itself.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.099
- Arnold: Ahem.
- Gentlemen, I must beg you to excuse me.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.335
A wife's work is never done,
especially in a new house.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.204
- Yes, of course.
- Madam.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.741
Gentlemen, let us drink to
your journey and safe passage.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.046
- Thank you.
- You decided to keep it powdered, eh?

12:28.048 --> 12:31.416
Well, when in Rome.
Or Versailles, I should say.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.520
So you're on your way
to meet the French?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.925
Our allies in Hartford, yes.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.962
- We won't impose on you for more than a day.
- <i>( door opens )</i>

12:43.964 --> 12:45.530

12:45.532 --> 12:47.465
Does the men good
to see you here.

12:50.504 --> 12:54.839
Dispatch, sir. Sent from a John
Anderson under flag of truce.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.144
Not him.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.413
Pray, don't let us interfere
with army business.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.183
A flag of truce
is always of import.

13:18.331 --> 13:22.967
"Mr. John Anderson is amenable
to a meeting with Mr. Gustavus

13:22.969 --> 13:26.237
to discuss the terms for the
goods under discussion."

13:28.074 --> 13:29.974
Quite vague, isn't it?

13:29.976 --> 13:33.178
Who is John Anderson?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.046
Gustavus?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.517
I've discovered that my predecessor
shirked his duties here.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.086
I wouldn't put it past him to have
been on the London trade as well.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.190
This is no doubt one of his
profit-making schemes.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.162
To victory.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.365
All:
To victory.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.006
Where are you going?

14:02.008 --> 14:04.008
To inspect the lines.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.310
This late at night?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.612
Yes, this late at night.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.350
I don't have time
for games, Peggy.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.485
Then why are you
playing one with me?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.456
This has something to do with
that letter you received.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.525
I thought you had gone upstairs.

14:20.527 --> 14:25.230
Why is Mr. Anderson writing to you
after you ceased communications?

14:27.033 --> 14:30.101
Because I am meeting
with him tonight

14:30.103 --> 14:32.904
<i>to negotiate my terms
of service to the king.</i>

14:34.875 --> 14:37.208
- What?
- <i>Don't you see, my love?</i>

14:37.210 --> 14:39.577
This is my opportunity
to end this civil war,

14:39.579 --> 14:41.479
to be a peacemaker.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.548
I should have told you before,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.483
but I couldn't.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.518
Congress still
refuses to pay me.

14:49.589 --> 14:53.091
John Andrí is coming here?

14:53.093 --> 14:56.661
What? Yes.
Tonight.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.530
And I must arrange
for his safe passage

14:59.532 --> 15:02.400
and secure his guarantee
for our future.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.383
No more lies, Benedict.

15:18.385 --> 15:22.987
I'll play my part,
but no more lies.

15:22.989 --> 15:27.025
After tonight, we will have
no more need for them.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.128
Your guests are asleep,
but Franks is still up.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.197
I'll distract him while
you head out the back.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.119
If we get any closer,
we'll either hit their chain

15:55.121 --> 15:57.655
or have their artillery hit us.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.660
This is far enough. Drop
anchor and douse your lights.

16:17.377 --> 16:21.145
Well, sir, I must confess
I don't fully understand.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.314
And I don't know
how I can be any clearer.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.983
Well, if this is an army matter,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.685
why not have one of your
soldiers row out to the gunboat?

16:27.687 --> 16:30.288
My men are at their posts.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.991
And I don't explain
myself to bargemen.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.327
You can't tell us what to do.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.163
Take this sheepskin,
put it in your rowlocks,

16:39.165 --> 16:41.332
and muffle the oars.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.501
I just never heard
of no flag of truce meeting

16:43.503 --> 16:45.503
taking place in the dead
of night before.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.639
50 pounds of flour apiece

16:48.641 --> 16:50.441
and a bottle of rye whiskey.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.183
<i>Army shitheads.</i>

17:02.188 --> 17:05.390
A craft's approaching.
Looks harmless.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.659
Make sure to hold here, Captain.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.627
Shan't be more
than an hour or two.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.100
<i>( door closes )</i>

18:03.850 --> 18:07.652
Major Andrí.
Or should I say Anderson?

18:09.155 --> 18:11.255
General Clinton is honored
that you've decided

18:11.257 --> 18:13.491
to aid the cause of peace.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.594
And I am delighted to help
reforge the bonds of friendship

18:16.596 --> 18:19.430
between the king
and his loyal subjects.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.233
Given that certain
conditions are met.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.536
None that breach the common
standards of fairness

18:25.538 --> 18:27.405
and honor.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.356
In exchange for 20,000 pounds,

18:45.358 --> 18:47.859
I shall transfer to you
the plans for West Point

18:47.861 --> 18:52.530
along with information concerning
its armament and garrison.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.833
You can put those away.
I can't accept documents.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.570
And I'm authorized
to offer 5,000.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.540
- ( laughs )
- In addition I can arrange for a pension

19:02.542 --> 19:04.642
plus compensation
for your property

19:04.644 --> 19:07.645
subject, of course, to you providing
receipts to a board of inquiry.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.647
I may be willing
to accept 15,000,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.716
but I want guaranteed
compensation.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.484
No bloody board of inquiry.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.153
And a commission
as major general.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.755
I can prevail upon Clinton
to move to 10,000,

19:17.757 --> 19:20.591
but he'd insist on payments
of equal installments

19:20.593 --> 19:22.727
over five years
subject to land tax

19:22.729 --> 19:25.596
should you decide
to purchase new property.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.798
That's absurd.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.335
Let me remind you that you're
not just getting West Point,

19:31.337 --> 19:34.839
you're getting the General
Arnold, victor of Saratoga.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.241
I'm a bloody war hero.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.676
For the Continental Army.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.778
I've given you
intelligence concerning

19:40.780 --> 19:43.514
the depreciation of the currency
that you used to bankrupt Congress.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.650
Only until France
bailed you out.

19:45.652 --> 19:49.253
Yes, because the French understand
that victory costs money.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.657
How much is victory
worth to you, sir?

19:52.659 --> 19:53.958
Such as you can promise?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.827
10,000.
Payable over five years.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.262
And how much
is Washington worth?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.468
Yes, he's here.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.872
Right now.
Arrived this morning

20:07.874 --> 20:10.808
with a small entourage on his way to
meet with senior French commanders.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.712
<i>And he'll be returning
through here soon.</i>

20:14.714 --> 20:16.214
When?

20:16.216 --> 20:19.517
20,000 and the commission.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.920
We can end this war now, Andrí.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.523
Capture Washington
and it's over.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.962
I know what you
are authorized to offer.

20:30.964 --> 20:34.465
Clinton can't fault you
for a change in the weather.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.834
Think about what he would want.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.908
I can guarantee 20,000.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.579
<i>If you agree here and now</i>

20:48.581 --> 20:51.782
to break off your engagement
to Margaret Shippen.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.720
What?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.788
You heard me.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.658
I knew it.
I knew it.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.793
Back in Philadelphia,
you were more than friends.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.430
What do you care?
You get your fortune,

21:06.432 --> 21:08.833
you get your hero's welcome.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.735
All I want is her.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.871
Well, you want
what I already have.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.607
What I've been having
for months now.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.611
And her name's not
Shippen, it's Arnold.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.447
We were married at home.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.583
Are you sure you still want her?

21:27.587 --> 21:28.986
<i>( cannon fires )</i>

21:33.893 --> 21:37.028
Weigh anchor. Come about
and get us under way.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.030
I knew this would
happen, damn it.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.299
Aw, that was too high.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.801
Aim lower and give the
cheeky buggers a scare.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.337
Wake me if they don't scarper.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.774
And what about us, Jameson?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.909
What's the reward
for tipping you off?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.812
You did your duty, Paulding.
Your country thanks you.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.847
Good thing we was here, then.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.717
An enemy vessel creeping up
and you asleep on the watch.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.019
I wonder what the new general
would say if he hears about it.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.855
Take some bread and beer
and piss off.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.595
- <i>( cannon fires )</i>
- I thought you told them to douse the lights.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.664
I thought you had
control of this fort.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.566
The ship will retreat
downstream now.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.802
That's too far to row.
You'll have to go on foot.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.738
The nearest British outpost
is White Plains.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.907
That's 15 miles away.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.842
Then you'll have
to start walking.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.379
Here, wear these.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.680
No spare shoes.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.767
Your boots will have to do.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.853
- Damn these bargemen. Haven't they any paper?
- Must be another way.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.857
I'll write you a pass to get
you through our pickets.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.026
The woods are swarming
with Cowboys and Skinners,

22:42.028 --> 22:43.694
<i>so you'll have to be on guard.</i>

22:43.696 --> 22:46.063
Every man north of Verplanck's
Point knows my name,

22:46.065 --> 22:47.965
so this will guarantee you.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.009
The plans.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.113
We'll need them
to take West Point.

23:02.115 --> 23:04.415
<i>( cannon fires )</i>

23:12.658 --> 23:14.625
20,000.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.729
Peggy.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.033
<i>( cannon fires )</i>

23:25.872 --> 23:28.572
<i>( rustling )</i>

23:28.574 --> 23:32.009
Stop skulking, lads.
You can come out now.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.882
Time to pay up, old man.

23:37.884 --> 23:41.519
<i>You said the army would reward
us for pointing out the ship,</i>

23:41.521 --> 23:43.788
but we got nothing.

23:43.790 --> 23:47.591
You just made an
investment in your future.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.026
How's that?

23:49.028 --> 23:52.997
You see that ship
out there turning tail?

23:52.999 --> 23:56.200
She just left behind
her most precious cargo.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.136
What cargo?

23:59.138 --> 24:01.705
Treasure.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.941
Treasure worth hunting down.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.855
- Caleb!
- Annie.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.862
- How was New York?
- Where's Ben?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.997
- Ben, he's with Washington. Why?
- Where?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.866
West Point
on his way to Hartford.

24:28.868 --> 24:32.169
I need you to get him a message.
Them... both of them.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.839
Benedict Arnold is a traitor.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.908
I wrote down all
I learned in New York.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.977
He's behind
the counterfeit plot...

24:39.979 --> 24:41.011
- Oh, shit.
- ...the attacks on Middlebrook, everything.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.981
Wait, where are you going?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.016
Arnold's at West Point.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.196
Elias:
<i>So you promise that...</i>

24:59.198 --> 25:00.865
<i>that the case
will remain closed?</i>

25:00.867 --> 25:02.500
Simcoe:
<i>Yes, Elias.</i>

25:02.502 --> 25:04.134
<i>You have
the magistrate's word on it.</i>

25:04.136 --> 25:06.170
<i>And you have mine.</i>

25:17.917 --> 25:21.919
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

25:21.921 --> 25:24.188
Captain, would you
mind telling me

25:24.190 --> 25:26.524
what Elias Appleby
was doing here

25:26.526 --> 25:30.127
after you torched his entire harvest
of hay and slaughtered his livestock?

25:30.129 --> 25:32.796
Why, to thank me, of course.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.765
As so many have for my efforts

25:34.767 --> 25:37.902
to drive the wicked
elements from Setauket.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.137
Though I suppose they should
really be thanking you.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.922
If I had known what
you were going to do

25:41.923 --> 25:43.706
with the names I provided, I
never would have given them.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.142
I would have taken them
all the same.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.845
Your pointless hunt for Rogers

25:47.847 --> 25:49.880
is tearing this town apart.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.783
He is long gone
and you are stoking

25:52.785 --> 25:54.718
the fires of rebellion
in his absence.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.787
Within your son
in particular, it seems.

25:56.789 --> 25:57.988
What?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.190
He's been quite vocal lately.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.597
Abe has been like that
his whole life.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.935
He's a fool who runs
his mouth without thinking.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.736
On that we agree.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.205
Shame he never inherited
his father's discretion.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.850
<i>( insects chirping )</i>

26:26.852 --> 26:29.286
( softly ) Do not
tell your child.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.055
Once we...

26:35.761 --> 26:36.994
What do you think you're doing?

26:36.996 --> 26:38.896
Drinking.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.297
Sorry, there's no empty chairs.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.633
You keep talking treason,
there'll be plenty.

26:54.113 --> 26:57.381
Simcoe's time will come,
but you need to wait.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.985
- Wait? Wait for what?
- ( sighs )

27:00.987 --> 27:04.822
That's been your answer,
hasn't it, your whole life.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.923
Wait.

27:07.393 --> 27:11.128
This town looks to you
as a leader, not to me.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.963
So lead them.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.165
Speak up and do the right thing.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.067
<i>( door bangs )</i>

27:27.913 --> 27:30.881
( hawks, spits )

27:31.851 --> 27:34.985
How terribly uncouth.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.322
But it'd be more uncouth still for you
to not drink his health, Captain.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.058
Down the hatch.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.934
- Ah!
- ( men shouting )

27:50.936 --> 27:52.369
Man:
<i>You want some?</i>

27:52.371 --> 27:53.704
No!

27:55.041 --> 27:57.775
I simply won't abide rudeness.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.912
With me.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.257
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

28:14.260 --> 28:16.694
<i>( chatter )</i>

28:21.367 --> 28:24.068
Stings, doesn't it?
Hmm?

28:25.271 --> 28:27.971
I've been struck
by Simcoe before.

28:27.973 --> 28:30.708
The problem with him is no
one ever hits him back.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.309
Rogers took his ear.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.044
Well, then I guess
Rogers missed his chance.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.013
He's probably long gone by now.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.218
No, now it's up to you
to finish the job.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.888
Before Simcoe finishes you.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.590
What are you talking about?

28:46.591 --> 28:48.291
He won't rest till you
regulars leave him the town

28:48.294 --> 28:51.028
so he can burn the whole
damn thing down to ash.

28:51.030 --> 28:55.432
Now, he's out of control
and you know it.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.067
What do you propose I do?

28:57.069 --> 28:59.737
Look the other way

28:59.739 --> 29:02.372
while someone else does
what needs to be done.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.976
Now, if the arsenal at the
garrison is left unlocked,

29:05.978 --> 29:09.279
the problem
takes care of itself.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.249
And not a single British
musket need be fired.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.419
Now, once it's done,

29:15.421 --> 29:18.288
Setauket returns to peace.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.359
But with you in charge.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.332
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

29:49.955 --> 29:52.489
May I ask, gentlemen...

29:52.491 --> 29:54.792
to which party you belong?

29:57.463 --> 29:59.396
You'll forgive my ignorance,

29:59.397 --> 30:01.330
but up here in
the neutral ground,

30:01.333 --> 30:04.034
you never know who's what.

30:07.339 --> 30:11.308
But judging by the Hessian
kit you're wearing,

30:11.310 --> 30:13.277
I'd wager you're kingsmen.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.079
In which case
today's your lucky day.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.447
I'm a British officer.

30:19.118 --> 30:22.920
And there'll be a rich reward if
you escort me back to our lines.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.155
Well, we're Skinners

30:25.157 --> 30:27.157
and today ain't your lucky day.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.992
( chuckles )

30:28.994 --> 30:31.094
<i>Oh, thank God, gentlemen.</i>

30:31.096 --> 30:34.331
I must do anything to get along...
here, let's speak truthfully.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.169
This guarantees me safe conduct.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.039
It's signed by
General Arnold himself.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.244
Commander at West Point.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.250
You're not gonna read it?

30:53.252 --> 30:55.252
( groans )

31:01.227 --> 31:03.360
- Cheers.
- Andrí: No!

31:03.362 --> 31:05.295
( grunting )

31:12.371 --> 31:15.305
<i>Hey, Paulding,
can you read this?</i>

31:18.177 --> 31:21.378
Gentlemen, I am sure
General Arnold

31:21.380 --> 31:23.513
<i>will reward
your dedication to duty</i>

31:23.515 --> 31:27.150
if you return those
and me to him.

31:28.354 --> 31:32.122
Oh, I'm sure he would,
Johnny boy.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.897
Let's have a gander.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.906
<i>( laughs )
Oh, dearie me.</i>

31:48.908 --> 31:51.408
Looks like you boys
have caught yourself

31:51.410 --> 31:54.444
an enemy spy or two.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.146
This man is Major Rogers
of the Queen's Rangers.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.649
He serves the king...
( groans )

31:58.651 --> 32:02.152
Not anymore, I don't.
You made sure of that.

32:02.154 --> 32:06.290
Now I'm just
plain old Robbie Rogers

32:06.292 --> 32:09.359
from Massachusetts.

32:09.361 --> 32:13.430
An American who serves
his country.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.365
( spits )

32:17.102 --> 32:21.638
You want reward, you take
him to Jameson, not Arnold.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.175
He'll pay you this time.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.478
Off you go.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.687
Hey.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.256
You stick with the story.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.658
I was never here.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.197
You'll hang for this!
You'll hang!

32:48.400 --> 32:52.669
No, John, not me.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.684
You say this man's a British
officer, yet he wears no uniform.

33:07.686 --> 33:11.321
You say he's a British spy, but he
bears a pass from General Arnold,

33:11.323 --> 33:14.725
<i>carries plans of West Point, yet they're
in General Arnold's handwriting.</i>

33:14.727 --> 33:17.728
How, then, did he acquire them?

33:17.730 --> 33:19.596
We're just doing our duty.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.398
What's the reward?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.368
I know nothing of any reward.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.371
You'll have to wait for
General Arnold to clear it.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.242
Andrí: <i>I apologize</i>
for this, Colonel.

33:32.244 --> 33:36.179
I do hope we can clear up this
misunderstanding before too long.

33:36.181 --> 33:40.183
You see what kind of people
I have to deal with?

33:40.185 --> 33:43.120
It's so rare to find a
gentleman around these parts.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.422
Still, this business
with the plans and the pass,

33:45.424 --> 33:47.190
I'm afraid it's all very rum.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.526
I will have to make a
report to General Arnold.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.129
Of course, Colonel.
I completely understand.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.097
Indeed, please
make sure to mention

33:54.099 --> 33:58.101
that "Mr. John Anderson"
is keen to be on his way.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.547
8,000 men into Canada.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.351
A bold move.

34:14.353 --> 34:18.321
George, I have a strategy which I
must discuss with you... in private.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.424
It's not quite ready yet.

34:20.426 --> 34:24.327
Perhaps you could postpone your trip
to Hartford for just a few days?

34:24.329 --> 34:27.364
It's possible, sir. We're
not expected till Friday.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.831
Are you sure, Benedict?

34:28.833 --> 34:30.766
Judging by the
cannonading last night,

34:30.768 --> 34:32.569
sounds as if you have
enough on your plate.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.338
Oh, that? No.
It's nothing.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.440
<i>We have occasional
interlopers up here.</i>

34:37.443 --> 34:38.675
<i>Our gunners scare them off.</i>

34:38.677 --> 34:40.444
It woke me last night
as well, sir.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.312
<i>Shall I investigate?</i>

34:42.313 --> 34:44.648
Colonel Jameson's report
will be here soon.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.449
If it were serious, he would
have informed us already.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.851
Perhaps I can
save him the trouble.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.418
Go down and fetch
the report myself.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.405
There's really no need.

34:51.406 --> 34:53.389
Jameson's on notice.
I'd like to see how he does.

34:53.391 --> 34:56.159
Thank you, Major. General
Arnold has it in hand.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.695
Yes, sir.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.132
You'll stay
for breakfast, at least.

35:02.134 --> 35:05.168
- Of course.
- I'll tell them to hurry.

35:07.139 --> 35:10.774
The old man agrees with you.
Have a sniff about.

35:13.112 --> 35:15.479
Come on.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.782
- ( horse panting )
- Just a little longer. Come on.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.285
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:23.589 --> 35:24.821
Whoa.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.124
Good morning.
I'm Continental Army.

35:27.126 --> 35:30.293
I need a fresh horse.
Yours.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.729
Well, I'm a Skinner and she's
Patriot property, friend.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.866
Fine.
Then I'm a Cowboy

35:35.868 --> 35:39.236
and I'm stealin' her,<i> friend.</i>

35:43.842 --> 35:47.344
- I'm looking for Colonel Jameson.
- Over there, sir.

35:48.780 --> 35:52.349
Hey, you got our money?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.787
Ah, is that the colonel's
morning report?

35:57.789 --> 35:59.689
Yes, sir.
Bound for West Point.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.725
Right, bit of a wasted trip.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.294
- Sir?
- No, nothing. Carry on.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.929
I'll speak to the man himself.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.701
- Colonel Jameson.
- Yes?

36:11.703 --> 36:15.205
I'm Major Benjamin Tallmadge,
General Washington's staff.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.676
His Excellency sent me to inquire
about what happened here last night.

36:19.678 --> 36:23.613
Oh, nothing much. Enemy
ship got a little cocky.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.550
She turned tail after a few shots.
It's all in my report.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.452
<i>Some Skinners brought this
gentlemen here a few hours ago.</i>

36:29.454 --> 36:31.721
<i>Said he was a spy,
but he had a pass</i>

36:31.723 --> 36:34.858
<i>from General Arnold
which they couldn't read.</i>

36:34.860 --> 36:38.328
- Misunderstanding.
- Yes, of course.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.397
Colonel Jameson,
might I have a word?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.442
You say that man
was just brought in

36:52.444 --> 36:55.679
by these Skinners here
with whom you're acquainted?

36:55.681 --> 36:57.480
Unfortunately.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.816
And did he come in
without any shoes?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.551
He didn't have any, no.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.588
And you didn't find that odd?

37:04.590 --> 37:07.490
Or perhaps more curious
than one of our Skinners

37:07.492 --> 37:09.893
wearing a pair
of royal officer's boots?

37:11.697 --> 37:13.797
What's his name in there?

37:13.799 --> 37:18.401
Uh... Anderson.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.936
John Anderson.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.643
I should add he had plans
of West Point on his person.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.946
- What?
- Yes, but, see, they were in General Arnold's handwriting.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.915
And you only thought
to mention this <i> now?</i>

37:31.917 --> 37:35.719
Of course not. It's all in
my report to General Arnold.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.687
Your...

37:52.704 --> 37:54.771
Arnold:
Thank you.

37:58.744 --> 38:02.579
Benedict, are you happy here?

38:02.581 --> 38:04.014
I beg your pardon?

38:05.517 --> 38:08.818
I'm short of reliable
battlefield commanders.

38:08.820 --> 38:13.056
For this next offensive, I want
you to command my left wing.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.594
If you still feel
up to the fight.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.065
Sir.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.067
Colonel Jameson's report.

38:28.607 --> 38:31.808
Jameson's voice: <i>A Mr. John Anderson,
who claims your close acquaintance,</i>

38:31.810 --> 38:33.977
<i>was captured at dawn
by local militia.</i>

38:33.979 --> 38:36.846
<i>He was found to be carrying
a pass guaranteed by you</i>

38:36.848 --> 38:39.816
<i>as well as plans of our
fortifications at West Point.</i>

38:41.086 --> 38:43.720
Anything that should concern us?

38:43.722 --> 38:47.857
Oh, just a ship
in the night, as it were.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.360
Gentlemen, please excuse me.
Ahem.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.371
What's the matter?

39:01.373 --> 39:03.473
We are undone.

39:03.475 --> 39:06.843
- We are undone.
- What?

39:06.845 --> 39:09.279
Andrí has been captured.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.714
Tallmadge will bring him here. They'll
make him talk. He knows everything.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.917
- What'll they do with him?
- I don't know.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.019
- Will they hang him?
- They'll hang <i> us.</i>

39:16.021 --> 39:18.054
- I must flee <i> now.</i>
- You?

39:18.056 --> 39:19.989
Washington would never
harm a woman.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.691
Especially not an innocent one.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.660
And you are going to need
to play the innocent

39:23.662 --> 39:26.396
better than anyone ever has.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.131
We'll be together again soon.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.567
I promise.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.604
Benedict...?

39:41.012 --> 39:42.746
Urgent for Washington!

39:42.748 --> 39:46.049
- Halt. Dismount!
- Lieutenant Brewster, 2nd Artillery.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.684
Get Tallmadge, damn it!

39:50.021 --> 39:52.021
Prepare your boat
and row me downriver now.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.724
I meant to ask, why'd you lot shoot
at that ship if it were under...

39:54.726 --> 39:56.659
I said now!

39:56.661 --> 39:58.528
<i>( door creaks )</i>

39:58.530 --> 40:01.097
Sir!
Let go of me! Sir!

40:02.667 --> 40:04.901
- Arnold's a traitor, sir.
- What?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.537
Arnold, he's a traitor. It's
right here in the letter.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.039
Anna got it straight
from Andrés desk.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.012
Hamilton:
Sir...?

40:20.051 --> 40:21.651
Sir...?

40:47.145 --> 40:48.945
Feather your blades.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.064
( gunshot echoes )

41:23.648 --> 41:26.049
Row!

41:29.688 --> 41:32.789
<i>( faint voices speaking )</i>

41:38.697 --> 41:41.130
- This...
- ( blade rattles )

41:41.132 --> 41:46.102
- Sir.
- ...should be here... right here at your side, always.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.846
Simcoe:
<i>Right on time, Woodhull.</i>

42:05.290 --> 42:07.891
I'm sorry.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.170
Ugh!

42:25.010 --> 42:27.043
( grunts, groans )

42:30.181 --> 42:31.915
Get a rope.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.983
( grunting )

42:37.756 --> 42:41.157
<i>( theme music playing )</i>
