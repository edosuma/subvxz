02:05.599 --> 02:08.032
Miller, this situation
is out of control and dangerous.

02:08.033 --> 02:09.800
Johnson, I'm calling it in.

02:09.801 --> 02:12.971
Headquarters is ready to send
military backup on my word.

02:12.973 --> 02:15.040
Stay focused.

02:15.042 --> 02:16.708
She is the key
to the source.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.111
She's always been the key.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.649
Yeah, well,
I don't think she's here alone.

02:45.104 --> 02:49.975
Agent Johnson file 69232B.

02:49.977 --> 02:52.109
Constant 24-7 surveillance

02:52.111 --> 02:56.650
so far has garnered nothing
but mundane daily life.

03:05.057 --> 03:06.991
We continue
to monitor the subject

03:06.993 --> 03:09.860
with no extraordinary
results so far.

03:09.862 --> 03:11.395
At current,

03:11.397 --> 03:16.400
the subject is completely
unaware of our probe.

03:16.402 --> 03:19.169
She continues
to live her current identity

03:19.171 --> 03:22.676
with apparently no recollection
of what has happened to her.

03:24.311 --> 03:25.677
We remain vigilant

03:25.679 --> 03:28.046
gathering and documenting
all information

03:28.048 --> 03:31.252
and will keep the Bureau
aware of all developments.

03:37.324 --> 03:40.058
Dr. Luiza Moreira?

03:40.060 --> 03:42.060
- Dr. Luiza Moreira.
- Moreira.

03:42.062 --> 03:43.794
You must be Dr. Jones.

03:43.796 --> 03:46.133
Yes, but you can call me Vincent.
Please sit.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.800
I'm part of a team of experts

03:49.802 --> 03:51.703
in various disciplines.

03:51.705 --> 03:55.673
Your background in psychology
and cultural anthropology

03:55.675 --> 03:59.411
plus your work in South Africa
is exceptional.

03:59.413 --> 04:02.413
We all came together
to help solve a case

04:02.415 --> 04:04.014
or outbreak or...

04:04.016 --> 04:06.851
I don't know what it is.

04:06.853 --> 04:09.086
I've decided
to keep a video record

04:09.088 --> 04:11.989
of all facts and findings.

04:11.991 --> 04:13.991
It's been very crazy lately.

04:13.993 --> 04:15.859
We just received
another victim.

04:15.861 --> 04:19.230
So are they victims
or infected?

04:19.232 --> 04:21.265
How much have you
been briefed on?

04:21.267 --> 04:22.134
Not much.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.437
Authorities up and down
the East Coast

04:25.439 --> 04:27.005
thought they were dealing

04:27.007 --> 04:30.108
with some sort of
serial killer, I guess.

04:30.110 --> 04:32.110
Well, bodies
have been showing up

04:32.112 --> 04:33.844
along the eastern seaboard.

04:33.846 --> 04:36.113
Maybe beyond.

04:36.115 --> 04:39.718
Police were discovering bodies.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.986
Skulls smashed,

04:42.988 --> 04:45.123
parts of the brains missing.

04:45.125 --> 04:48.026
But the timelines
didn't match up.

04:48.028 --> 04:51.262
The victims... six at first...
all died

04:51.264 --> 04:55.500
within roughly
the same time period,

04:55.502 --> 04:58.103
across several states.

04:58.105 --> 05:00.204
Law enforcement officials

05:00.206 --> 05:03.108
shared information
and determined...

05:03.110 --> 05:05.009
- Sheriff Williams?
- Yep.

05:05.011 --> 05:07.010
- What're these guys doing here?
- Oh, it's okay,

05:07.012 --> 05:08.880
it's the press.
I called them.

05:08.882 --> 05:10.781
Look, I am gonna warn you now.

05:10.783 --> 05:12.117
It's not a pretty site.

05:12.119 --> 05:13.384
We've been sharing information

05:13.386 --> 05:16.120
with other
law enforcement officials.

05:16.122 --> 05:17.387
What has been determined

05:17.389 --> 05:19.257
that a single killer
cannot do all this.

05:19.259 --> 05:21.825
He can't be in several places
at the same time.

05:21.827 --> 05:23.127
It's impossible.
I'm tired of the Feds

05:23.129 --> 05:25.497
saying there's a serial killer
out there.

05:25.499 --> 05:28.132
There's no serial killer.
It's not one person doing this.

05:28.134 --> 05:29.534
You see what's on
tis landscape here?

05:29.536 --> 05:32.036
Earlier today I found
two women at a camp site.

05:32.038 --> 05:34.404
First they're alive
and just like that,

05:34.406 --> 05:36.307
they both dropped dead
right in front of me.

05:36.309 --> 05:38.343
There's some crazy shit
going on here,

05:38.345 --> 05:40.245
and the public
needs to be aware.

05:40.247 --> 05:41.980
You gotta know
what's going on.

05:41.982 --> 05:44.882
Open your eyes be aware.

05:44.884 --> 05:48.952
Investigators
thought maybe it was a cult.

05:48.954 --> 05:50.387
Like Manson.

05:50.389 --> 05:53.024
It's a bunch of Satanists
all along the shore.

05:53.026 --> 05:54.558
Some kind of crazy cult.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.327
Just chopping people's bodies up
and eating like their brains

05:57.329 --> 06:00.298
like some type
of devil worship!

06:00.300 --> 06:01.565
It's sick!

06:01.567 --> 06:06.503
The skulls
weren't smashed in.

06:06.505 --> 06:09.240
They had burst outward.

06:09.242 --> 06:11.242
I'm presenting you something...

06:11.244 --> 06:14.411
I was contacted
to join this team.

06:14.413 --> 06:15.913
I and the others

06:15.915 --> 06:18.515
are trying to explain
the phenomenon

06:18.517 --> 06:21.920
from every possible angle.

06:21.922 --> 06:24.055
I was told that the body
that arrived today

06:24.057 --> 06:25.589
was of a college student.

06:25.591 --> 06:28.425
Yeah, uh, the police
gave me,

06:28.427 --> 06:32.363
uh, some videos and materials
for you to look at.

06:32.365 --> 06:33.832
What's that?

06:33.834 --> 06:35.966
All of this facility
is recorded

06:35.968 --> 06:37.502
including this office.

06:37.504 --> 06:39.070
Are we being monitored?

06:39.072 --> 06:42.574
Think of it as like
a black box on a plane.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.909
Unless the plane goes down,

06:44.911 --> 06:47.911
then the box is retrieved.

06:47.913 --> 06:50.048
Is that legal?

06:50.050 --> 06:52.050
You're working
for the US Government now.

06:52.052 --> 06:53.517
I have a lot to do.

06:53.519 --> 06:54.952
I'll see you later,

06:54.954 --> 06:57.988
and maybe
we can have lunch.

06:57.990 --> 07:01.259
Yes, of course.

07:01.261 --> 07:02.997
Okay, bye.

07:05.432 --> 07:08.332
The victims
share nothing in common

07:08.334 --> 07:11.301
that could help us
pinpoint the motive

07:11.303 --> 07:14.505
or cause of death.

07:14.507 --> 07:17.341
Then we got these videos

07:17.343 --> 07:18.543
from police in Montauk.

07:18.545 --> 07:20.277
Homelessness...

07:20.279 --> 07:22.613
- You ready?
- Huh... oh, yeah, yeah, dude.

07:22.615 --> 07:25.250
- Uh, just go ahead and roll.
- Okay.

07:25.252 --> 07:27.517
Three... two...

07:27.519 --> 07:29.086
Homelessness.

07:29.088 --> 07:31.389
Often considered to be
a symptom of urban blight.

07:31.391 --> 07:33.625
But here in the tranquil beaches
of Montauk, New York,

07:33.627 --> 07:36.127
away from the cities,
away from the attractions,

07:36.129 --> 07:38.128
we find societies
unfortunate citizens

07:38.130 --> 07:40.397
finding themselves
to be outcasts and alone.

07:40.399 --> 07:42.666
while their surroundings
may in fact be nicer,

07:42.668 --> 07:44.337
their plight
is not any easier.

07:46.105 --> 07:50.140
My colleagues
don't see any relevance,

07:50.142 --> 07:53.110
but I...

07:53.112 --> 07:55.980
Maybe it's nothing.

07:55.982 --> 07:57.981
But it's interesting.

07:57.983 --> 08:00.385
Hello, excuse me, sir.
Oh, oh, uh, sorry.

08:00.387 --> 08:02.519
Look, it's okay.
We're shooting a documentary.

08:02.521 --> 08:05.123
All right, we just want
to ask you a couple questions.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.894
Would that be...
would that be okay?

08:07.694 --> 08:10.428
Um, uh, look.

08:10.430 --> 08:13.331
We're, we're terribly
sorry to bother you.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.132
We just wanna ask you
a couple questions.

08:15.134 --> 08:17.101
You know, we're just
interested in how you got here.

08:17.103 --> 08:18.635
How you got
in this predicament.

08:18.637 --> 08:20.538
They put me here.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.176
Who put you here?

08:24.209 --> 08:26.610
They took mommy.

08:26.612 --> 08:28.245
She was good at numbers,

08:28.247 --> 08:31.248
and they left
what was left of daddy.

08:31.250 --> 08:34.451
They left me
on the boat for ten years.

08:34.453 --> 08:37.054
But they took and they gave.

08:37.057 --> 08:38.488
They gave mommy back,
but not to me.

08:38.490 --> 08:40.390
They gave me a gift.

08:40.393 --> 08:42.659
They gave me a job.

08:42.662 --> 08:44.899
But they said I wasn't worthy.

08:46.066 --> 08:48.232
They said
it was for someone special.

08:48.234 --> 08:49.700
My analysis,

08:49.702 --> 08:53.603
plus any evidence
that comes my way.

08:53.605 --> 08:56.273
In this case,

08:56.275 --> 08:58.642
the first video

08:58.644 --> 09:01.345
is the beginning
of a student film.

09:01.347 --> 09:03.982
This project was your idea.
I swear, if this film

09:03.984 --> 09:05.483
fucks up my class grade,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

09:05.485 --> 09:07.118
Oh, you're gonna
fucking kick my ass, dude?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.520
Just man up and talk to him.

09:08.522 --> 09:10.655
Dude, big talk for the guy that's
safe behind the fucking camera.

09:10.657 --> 09:12.456
You know what? Why don't you
try coming on this side

09:12.458 --> 09:14.459
talking to the fucking
crazy person for once, huh?

09:14.461 --> 09:16.594
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.

09:16.596 --> 09:19.229
- Are you being fucking serious?
- Yeah, stop busting my balls

09:19.231 --> 09:20.998
and hand over the camera.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.233
Or are you all talk,
you fucking chickenshit?

09:23.235 --> 09:27.738
Could it be
a really clever killer

09:27.740 --> 09:30.775
who did something
to the bodies

09:30.777 --> 09:34.012
to make them seem
less like homicide?

09:34.014 --> 09:37.647
They tell me what to write,

09:37.649 --> 09:40.517
and then they tell me to wait.

09:40.519 --> 09:42.520
Good.

09:42.522 --> 09:45.422
The teachings are for him.

09:45.424 --> 09:47.026
The gift...

09:51.663 --> 09:53.664
the gift is for you.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.233
For me?

09:55.235 --> 09:57.768
Sir, where are you talking...?

09:57.770 --> 10:00.373
It was always yours.

10:06.245 --> 10:08.378
Oh my God. Ben, stop
fucking with this guy, man.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.748
I wanna go home.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.617
Dude, I wanna
get this over with.

10:12.619 --> 10:14.618
We're already past deadline.

10:14.620 --> 10:16.222
They're in my head.

10:21.061 --> 10:22.660
Dude, come over here.

10:22.662 --> 10:24.796
Check this out. I think there's
actually something in here.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.664
Like some kind
of funky snake.

10:26.666 --> 10:30.634
Some kind
of natural build up

10:30.636 --> 10:32.369
within the victims,

10:32.371 --> 10:34.372
brought on by something,

10:34.374 --> 10:38.776
a poison, a disease,

10:38.778 --> 10:40.313
a parasite.

10:41.313 --> 10:43.283
Oh! Ahh!

10:44.384 --> 10:46.383
I am their prophet

10:46.385 --> 10:48.187
and you're that messenger.

10:52.258 --> 10:54.691
For the student
found on the beach,

10:54.693 --> 10:56.160
the cause of death

10:56.162 --> 10:58.798
matches the other
cases along the coast.

11:00.466 --> 11:03.633
As for the homeless man...

11:03.635 --> 11:06.237
The homeless man
is still missing,

11:06.239 --> 11:10.241
but his book
came to us with the videos.

11:10.243 --> 11:13.781
My colleagues
have no interest in it.

11:22.522 --> 11:24.188
You think this is funny?

11:25.692 --> 11:27.157
You think this is funny?

11:27.159 --> 11:28.593
There's two people
in that video.

11:28.595 --> 11:29.727
Now one's dead.

11:29.729 --> 11:31.195
Worse than dead,

11:31.197 --> 11:32.829
one we can't find,
and there's you.

11:32.831 --> 11:35.101
Okay, fine.
I'll turn this off.

11:37.570 --> 11:40.371
Now you got to see
how this looks.

11:40.373 --> 11:41.906
You and your friend
disappear for a week.

11:41.908 --> 11:45.142
Now we find him dead
on the beach...

11:45.144 --> 11:46.544
that's how we found him...

11:46.546 --> 11:49.579
and then we find you
wondering around the streets.

11:49.581 --> 11:50.781
You see?

11:50.783 --> 11:52.318
It doesn't look good.

11:55.321 --> 11:56.921
Don't you think?

11:56.923 --> 11:59.623
- How's it going?
- What do you think?

11:59.625 --> 12:01.224
Good.

12:01.226 --> 12:03.426
I need some help here.
You gonna help me here?

12:03.428 --> 12:05.863
Lucas, are you gonna
help me here, okay?

12:05.865 --> 12:08.199
We found these books
with the body.

12:08.201 --> 12:10.734
They were stolen from
the New York public library.

12:10.736 --> 12:12.271
Any idea why?

12:15.607 --> 12:21.212
Big books on, um, history,

12:21.214 --> 12:24.482
um, space travel and physics,
but we checked

12:24.484 --> 12:27.384
and he doesn't study
any of those subjects.

12:27.386 --> 12:29.786
He's focused on film class
just like you are.

12:29.788 --> 12:31.357
So why would he steal 'em?

12:33.559 --> 12:35.358
Answer him kid.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.594
Was he on drugs maybe?
He was on drugs maybe

12:37.596 --> 12:41.398
and he was trying to sell these books
and make some quick cash, maybe?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.401
Fast cash?
Yes, no?

12:43.403 --> 12:45.335
Okay, Lucas,

12:45.337 --> 12:47.305
we found the video.

12:47.307 --> 12:50.608
Okay, we saw the video...
found it and we saw it...

12:50.610 --> 12:52.910
we do not think
that you had anything

12:52.912 --> 12:54.911
to do directly
with your friend's murder,

12:54.913 --> 12:57.915
but you need to help me here,
you need to help me here,

12:57.917 --> 12:59.550
or I am gonna jam
your fuckin' ass up,

12:59.552 --> 13:00.951
I'm gonna
put you in prison,

13:00.953 --> 13:03.253
and you are not gonna
do well in prison, Lucas.

13:03.255 --> 13:04.689
You're gonna be
a piece of chicken in there.

13:04.691 --> 13:05.956
They're gonna
pass you around

13:05.958 --> 13:07.592
like a motherfuckin'
tissue paper

13:07.594 --> 13:09.594
and blow their noses
in you.

13:09.596 --> 13:11.264
Is the homeless guy dead, too?

13:13.365 --> 13:15.932
Did he attack you and then you
killed him in self-defense

13:15.934 --> 13:17.701
and then panicked
and left the body somewhere?

13:17.703 --> 13:19.369
Speak up, kid.

13:19.371 --> 13:22.239
You can't tell me who the
other guy in the video is?

13:22.241 --> 13:23.574
You can't?

13:23.576 --> 13:27.612
Okay, listen, what the fuck is this thing?
What's this thing?

13:27.614 --> 13:29.546
'Cause you were holding on it
for dear fuckin' life

13:29.548 --> 13:30.815
when we jammed your ass up.

13:30.817 --> 13:32.717
As far as we can tell,
it's the same one

13:32.719 --> 13:34.986
he has in the video.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.521
So how did it come to be
in your possession?

13:37.523 --> 13:39.456
That's hard to explain.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.892
That's gonna be a fuckin' jury's ass
up, man, and put you in prison.

13:41.894 --> 13:43.694
- The book was...
- Take a breathe, all right?

13:43.696 --> 13:45.262
Relax.
Nobody's here to hurt you.

13:45.264 --> 13:47.765
You wanna take a break, okay?
Take a break?

13:47.767 --> 13:49.367
- Take a break.
- Take a drink, all right?

13:49.369 --> 13:51.901
- Oh, what the fuck.
- You're bullshittin' me, right?

13:51.903 --> 13:53.874
- Oh, what the...
- What the... shit!

13:55.642 --> 13:56.906
No, no, no, it's okay.

13:56.908 --> 13:58.475
Lucas, it's okay.
It's okay, man.

13:58.477 --> 14:00.611
Hey, hey, relax.

14:00.613 --> 14:02.613
Relax.
Okay, come on.

14:02.615 --> 14:04.448
You don't wanna do this?

14:04.450 --> 14:07.450
You wanna do this?
You wanna kill me?

14:07.452 --> 14:09.719
Why you do wanna kill me?

14:09.721 --> 14:11.988
I've been nice to you.

14:11.990 --> 14:13.891
You're safe here.
Lucas, you're safe here, okay?

14:13.893 --> 14:15.493
We can just forget
you even did this.

14:15.495 --> 14:17.762
Just give me the gun back.
Just give me the gun.

14:17.764 --> 14:19.363
Come on, just give it me.
Just put it down.

14:19.365 --> 14:20.864
Put it on the table
and we'll forget about it.

14:20.866 --> 14:22.699
- There are voices in my head.
- Lucas, look, Lucas.

14:22.701 --> 14:24.768
- There are voices in my head!
- What? You hear voices?

14:24.770 --> 14:26.704
Okay, we'll find you a doctor,
we'll get rid of the voices.

14:26.706 --> 14:28.575
There are voices in my head!

14:29.509 --> 14:32.910
I've done some research
about the beach at Montauk,

14:32.912 --> 14:34.612
the same area
where the police

14:34.614 --> 14:37.714
discovered the student's body.

14:37.716 --> 14:40.050
The homeless man
talked about

14:40.052 --> 14:43.587
losing his parents
a decade ago.

14:43.589 --> 14:45.690
Back then,
the Coast Guard

14:45.692 --> 14:47.892
came across a small yacht

14:47.894 --> 14:51.664
drifting offshore
near that beach.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.469
Hey, Tommy,
come here, buddy.

14:58.471 --> 14:59.737
Let me show you
how to do this.

14:59.739 --> 15:01.705
Be care,
that's sharp.

15:01.707 --> 15:04.041
Okay, all right.

15:04.043 --> 15:06.444
All right, let's,
all right.

15:06.446 --> 15:07.781
Got it?

15:10.515 --> 15:11.916
Jesus.
Come here.

15:11.918 --> 15:15.051
Be careful, I said.
You're gonna poke your eye out.

15:15.053 --> 15:17.821
So you wanna put your thumb on
this so you don't lose the line.

15:17.823 --> 15:20.123
All right,
you push this back

15:20.125 --> 15:22.859
and let it go
out into the water.

15:22.861 --> 15:24.929
- What happens if you don't...
- So go a head.

15:24.931 --> 15:27.797
put, um,
put your finger there?

15:27.799 --> 15:29.934
Well, it'll go out
faster than you want it to

15:29.936 --> 15:31.835
- and maybe...
- Use all of it.

15:31.837 --> 15:34.537
Yeah, use all of it
and tangle up...

15:34.539 --> 15:36.540
According to the report,

15:36.542 --> 15:38.809
the boy claimed

15:38.811 --> 15:41.712
his father was killed

15:41.714 --> 15:45.782
and his mother abducted,

15:45.784 --> 15:48.651
but he was in
a state of shock

15:48.653 --> 15:51.921
and couldn't
provide any details.

15:51.923 --> 15:53.523
There you go.
Now hold on tight.

15:53.525 --> 15:55.925
Here we let it...
you gotta...

15:55.927 --> 15:57.895
you gotta tease 'em with it
a little bit.

15:57.897 --> 16:00.765
You know,
you have to feel it.

16:00.767 --> 16:04.033
You see,
the best part of fishing's

16:04.035 --> 16:06.103
just being out here
and feeling the wind

16:06.105 --> 16:08.004
in your hair...

16:08.006 --> 16:10.174
feeling the boat move
on the water.

16:10.176 --> 16:11.642
Look at the view here.

16:11.644 --> 16:13.980
- Isn't that cool?
- Yeah.

16:23.054 --> 16:24.954
Dad?

16:24.956 --> 16:27.727
- What is it, buddy?
- Look at that.

16:29.461 --> 16:31.762
There's nothing.

16:31.764 --> 16:33.897
No follow-up reports.

16:33.899 --> 16:35.900
No names are given.

16:35.902 --> 16:39.639
I hit a dead end.

16:54.821 --> 16:56.719
There's a brief mention

16:56.721 --> 17:00.123
that the mother
was a renowned scientist.

17:00.125 --> 17:04.627
There's some speculation
that perhaps

17:04.630 --> 17:07.664
she was kidnapped.

17:07.665 --> 17:10.601
No cause of death
for the father is given.

17:10.603 --> 17:12.068
There's a note

17:12.069 --> 17:15.038
that the boy
was hospitalized.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.842
Either people
aren't talking

17:17.844 --> 17:21.010
or the right files
didn't survive.

17:21.012 --> 17:24.848
The family's identity
is a mystery.

17:24.851 --> 17:28.751
I can't prove this,

17:28.753 --> 17:32.890
but what if the homeless man

17:32.892 --> 17:36.794
was the boy
on the yacht, grown up?

17:36.796 --> 17:38.562
The Coast Guard report

17:38.564 --> 17:43.633
does match elements
of the homeless man's story.

17:43.635 --> 17:47.071
Could he have slipped through
the cracks over the years,

17:47.073 --> 17:50.908
bouncing from
hospital to hospital,

17:50.910 --> 17:54.010
until all recorded proof

17:54.012 --> 17:57.882
of his existence disappeared?

17:57.884 --> 18:01.684
If the boy grew up

18:01.686 --> 18:03.821
to be the homeless man,

18:03.823 --> 18:07.624
maybe his parents
were the first victims

18:07.626 --> 18:09.796
of whatever it is.

18:11.530 --> 18:12.796
Could the thing in the jug

18:12.798 --> 18:15.632
have something
to do with all this?

18:15.634 --> 18:18.168
She's here now.
She already started.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.636
We know what to do.

18:19.638 --> 18:21.905
Make sure she completes
her task.

18:21.907 --> 18:24.842
We'll make sure that nothing
interferes with this mission.

18:24.844 --> 18:26.680
Everything's depending on it.

18:28.114 --> 18:29.216
Thank you.

18:48.901 --> 18:50.934
So how did your meeting
with Jones go?

18:50.936 --> 18:52.835
You know, he's a suit.

18:52.837 --> 18:54.270
He may be watching this,

18:54.272 --> 18:55.738
you know?

18:55.740 --> 18:57.076
He's a great guy.

18:59.111 --> 19:02.313
You have no idea
who's watching this.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.950
No idea.

19:05.984 --> 19:09.753
Let me tell you something,
Johnson.

19:09.755 --> 19:13.123
I have seen my share
of crazy in my time,

19:13.125 --> 19:16.994
classified shit that would
make your hair turn white.

19:16.996 --> 19:20.064
If the people out there
saw what we saw,

19:20.066 --> 19:21.164
know what we know,

19:21.166 --> 19:24.101
there would be
panic in the streets.

19:24.103 --> 19:27.237
It's what they don't know
that has kept 'em safe.

19:27.239 --> 19:30.173
Think about that.

19:30.175 --> 19:32.875
But this,

19:32.877 --> 19:34.244
this is something else.

19:34.246 --> 19:36.212
This...

19:36.214 --> 19:38.015
this is the big one.

19:38.017 --> 19:42.018
And once Uncle Sam
gets his handle on it,

19:42.020 --> 19:46.055
germ warfare,
special weapons...

19:46.057 --> 19:49.895
they'll never
fuck with us again, ever.

19:51.130 --> 19:52.228
And you and me, Johnson,

19:52.230 --> 19:55.399
we were there
from the beginning...

19:55.401 --> 19:57.737
the day that everything changed.

20:19.290 --> 20:22.692
We are continuously
monitoring the subject.

20:22.694 --> 20:24.827
It is my opinion
that she seems to have a sense

20:24.829 --> 20:26.095
of being watched,

20:26.097 --> 20:28.766
and has developed
some sort of paranoia

20:28.768 --> 20:30.202
of her surroundings.

20:32.771 --> 20:34.203
She seems overwhelmed

20:34.205 --> 20:37.843
showing signs of fatigue
and physical deterioration.

20:40.179 --> 20:42.946
I am unable to deduce
that this could be the reason

20:42.948 --> 20:46.216
Dr. Luiza has been suffering
numerous headaches,

20:46.218 --> 20:50.023
which appears to be escalating
as time passes.

20:52.090 --> 20:55.761
These headaches have become
noticeably more severe.

21:02.034 --> 21:04.034
The others
here at the facility,

21:04.036 --> 21:06.202
they are baffled

21:06.204 --> 21:07.770
and scared.

21:07.772 --> 21:12.476
This epidemic
is reaching everyone

21:12.478 --> 21:17.381
and no one
has a clue, yet.

21:17.383 --> 21:20.249
They are dismissing
my theories.

21:20.251 --> 21:22.419
So what you're suggesting
is that we're dealing

21:22.421 --> 21:25.389
with some giant
prehistoric parasite?

21:25.391 --> 21:26.890
Just look at the video

21:26.892 --> 21:29.759
with the film student.

21:29.761 --> 21:32.863
You can see some kind
of large worm

21:32.865 --> 21:34.965
leap out of the jug.

21:34.967 --> 21:37.133
After that,
he ended up at the beach,

21:37.135 --> 21:38.901
dead, like the others,

21:38.903 --> 21:42.171
like something had forced
its way out of his head.

21:42.173 --> 21:44.040
I don't know what you think
you're seeing in these videos,

21:44.042 --> 21:46.309
'cause there is nothing
conclusive showing any worm

21:46.311 --> 21:47.911
or anything attacking anyone.

21:47.913 --> 21:49.912
There's a black blur.

21:49.914 --> 21:52.349
- That's it.
- Don't you get it?

21:52.351 --> 21:54.785
These worm-like organisms

21:54.787 --> 21:56.754
force their hosts
toward water.

21:56.756 --> 21:58.255
And that's happening

21:58.257 --> 22:00.023
with the victims
in these cases.

22:00.025 --> 22:01.792
They are moving toward water.

22:01.794 --> 22:03.160
If I wanna talk to someone
about parasites,

22:03.162 --> 22:06.196
I have an entire group
dedicated to that field.

22:06.198 --> 22:07.930
But you?

22:07.932 --> 22:09.767
You're supposed to be
working on the brain.

22:09.769 --> 22:11.934
Here's a thought.

22:11.936 --> 22:14.371
Whatever is happening
to these people

22:14.373 --> 22:16.239
is causing brain damage.

22:16.241 --> 22:19.409
So they started doing unexplainable,
irrational things. Simple.

22:19.411 --> 22:22.546
So you need to stop looking
for some bigger conspiracy.

22:22.548 --> 22:27.316
The homeless man,
crazy or not,

22:27.318 --> 22:28.919
may have managed

22:28.921 --> 22:31.157
to bury facts in here.

22:34.826 --> 22:36.093
It could shed some light

22:36.095 --> 22:39.228
on why the student
took the book

22:39.230 --> 22:41.768
then killed himself.

22:43.568 --> 22:46.903
I'll start reading it tonight.

22:46.905 --> 22:49.405
It couldn't hurt.

22:49.407 --> 22:52.176
High command wants
to document our every movement,

22:52.178 --> 22:54.914
so keep glasses on record
at all times.

22:56.015 --> 22:59.449
Copy that.

22:59.451 --> 23:01.921
The subject is leaving
her workplace.

23:11.297 --> 23:12.766
Hey.

23:17.336 --> 23:18.904
Hey!

23:29.048 --> 23:31.116
Do you believe in
a Higher Power?

23:33.352 --> 23:34.617
What're you talking about, man?

23:34.619 --> 23:36.886
Higher Power, man,
Greater Good.

23:36.888 --> 23:40.157
Something bigger than us.

23:40.159 --> 23:41.494
What're you high?

23:42.894 --> 23:44.995
'Cause I could use
a pick me up.

23:44.997 --> 23:46.166
Whatcha got?

23:48.032 --> 23:51.034
- I'm talking about life.
- Life?

23:51.036 --> 23:55.171
Life.
Life with a purpose.

23:55.173 --> 23:56.974
I have a purpose.

23:56.976 --> 23:59.913
Oh yeah,
does it pay money?

24:02.413 --> 24:04.483
The rewards are endless.

24:09.421 --> 24:11.455
Bigger than money.

24:11.457 --> 24:13.159
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:19.030 --> 24:21.131
When I was ten,

24:21.133 --> 24:23.033
I thought
my life was over, man,

24:23.035 --> 24:26.303
'cause they,
they took my mom

24:26.305 --> 24:28.173
for a grand mission.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.975
But now I realize it was,
it was an honor, man.

24:31.977 --> 24:35.982
I was chosen to usher in
the dawn a new world order.

24:38.182 --> 24:43.420
Look man, I talk to crazy
dudes all the time,

24:43.422 --> 24:45.488
but you're sick, man.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.924
I know of a free clinic
you can go to.

24:47.926 --> 24:50.163
What if I told you I can
give you anything you want?

24:53.531 --> 24:55.134
A better life.

24:56.602 --> 24:59.937
A better everything.

24:59.939 --> 25:02.639
- I'm listening.
- Yeah?

25:02.641 --> 25:04.274
What if I told you
all you have to do

25:04.276 --> 25:06.512
is look in the water.

25:11.049 --> 25:12.551
Just in there.

25:22.294 --> 25:24.163
Closer.

25:29.268 --> 25:32.035
You see it?

25:32.037 --> 25:33.139
Whoa.

25:36.174 --> 25:37.911
I do see something.

25:40.546 --> 25:43.313
But what is it?

25:43.315 --> 25:45.084
Everything.

25:47.286 --> 25:49.553
Kinda...

25:49.555 --> 25:51.188
Touch it.

25:51.190 --> 25:53.026
Kinda freaky.

26:16.315 --> 26:19.149
I feel.

26:19.151 --> 26:20.586
I serve.

26:22.153 --> 26:24.123
I shall obey.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.393
Thank you so much
for volunteering

26:30.395 --> 26:32.796
for our new world order.

26:32.798 --> 26:36.165
Your time will be
beneficial to you

26:36.167 --> 26:39.135
and to us.

26:39.137 --> 26:40.706
But mostly to us.

26:44.175 --> 26:47.276
I did good, didn't I?

26:47.278 --> 26:49.546
You're on your way?

26:49.548 --> 26:51.183
I'll protect you.

26:54.452 --> 26:57.621
I've been examining this book,

26:57.623 --> 27:00.690
well, if you can
call it a book.

27:00.692 --> 27:03.526
It completely lacks

27:03.528 --> 27:06.496
a coherent narrative.

27:06.498 --> 27:09.498
It makes no sense.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.669
It's just disjointed writing

27:12.671 --> 27:15.705
and crude drawings.

27:15.707 --> 27:19.476
Yet I've spent days,

27:19.478 --> 27:22.379
weeks, going through it.

27:22.381 --> 27:25.082
And there's something there,

27:25.084 --> 27:26.349
something I can't

27:26.351 --> 27:29.186
quite put my finger on.

27:29.188 --> 27:33.556
It's like,
if you weren't careful enough,

27:33.558 --> 27:38.094
just as you were
about to see something,

27:38.096 --> 27:39.830
you'd lose it.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.565
It would be gone

27:41.567 --> 27:44.234
and you'd have to start

27:44.236 --> 27:47.136
all over again.

27:47.138 --> 27:50.306
And that's where
I feel like I am now

27:50.308 --> 27:52.209
squinting at the pages,

27:52.211 --> 27:55.211
on the cusp of something.

27:55.213 --> 27:57.881
Then it's gone.

27:57.883 --> 28:00.784
But there
are some things in here

28:00.786 --> 28:04.821
that seem to tie to it all.

28:04.823 --> 28:06.323
The all of it.

28:06.325 --> 28:09.558
As I examine the pages,

28:09.560 --> 28:11.730
I get this sense of déjà vu.

28:14.432 --> 28:17.767
And when I look
at that image,

28:17.769 --> 28:21.438
it makes me think
of that thing

28:21.440 --> 28:23.142
in the jug.

28:34.819 --> 28:37.187
Okay, Dr. Jones,
ready when you are.

28:37.189 --> 28:39.288
Yes, I'm Dr. Vincent Jones.

28:39.290 --> 28:42.424
It's 10:35 a.m. March 7th,

28:42.426 --> 28:45.497
and I'm here in Autopsy room 3B.

28:46.565 --> 28:49.565
Who are these girls?

28:49.567 --> 28:52.235
Jane Doe's
according to the file.

28:52.237 --> 28:55.238
The poor chicks were fine
24 hours ago.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.340
They were camping together
by the lake.

28:57.342 --> 28:58.607
Who found the bodies?

28:58.609 --> 29:00.610
The local sheriff.

29:00.612 --> 29:03.646
- And where is the sheriff now?
- Not sure.

29:03.648 --> 29:06.516
He disappeared after
the delivery of the bodies.

29:06.518 --> 29:10.286
So what else do you know
what caused this?

29:10.288 --> 29:11.691
Here is the report.

29:16.295 --> 29:17.960
You got anything else?

29:17.962 --> 29:20.697
We took some CT scans
when they were delivered.

29:20.699 --> 29:22.668
The scans are over there.

29:27.506 --> 29:29.842
There's something
in her forehead.

29:38.349 --> 29:40.350
- Dr. Jones?
- What?

29:40.352 --> 29:41.918
- Dr. Jones!
- Help me!

29:41.920 --> 29:44.490
Get the fuck outta here!

29:51.430 --> 29:52.932
Fuck this!

30:06.510 --> 30:08.245
Somebody open the door!

30:08.247 --> 30:09.815
Open the fucking door!

30:12.351 --> 30:13.816
Do we need to contain
this situation?

30:13.818 --> 30:15.619
Yes,

30:15.621 --> 30:19.756
we cannot have this affect or
interfere with our primary target.

30:19.758 --> 30:21.894
Affirmative.
I am on it.

30:38.309 --> 30:39.544
Hey!

30:44.950 --> 30:47.452
Another video came in.

30:49.887 --> 30:51.823
I made sure I got it.

30:56.494 --> 30:59.431
My colleagues
haven't seen it.

31:00.432 --> 31:02.535
They have the bodies...

31:05.671 --> 31:08.975
but I don't know
if they are ready for this.

31:12.443 --> 31:14.311
I'm not sure

31:14.313 --> 31:16.215
any of us are ready.

31:20.085 --> 31:21.851
You're shooting my ass,
aren't you?

31:21.853 --> 31:24.688
Huh? Oh, may be.

31:24.690 --> 31:27.489
- You are such an idiot.
- What? Are you speaking?

31:27.491 --> 31:30.759
I can't really focus
on you right now.

31:30.761 --> 31:34.930
I said that you are going to be
sleeping alone tonight.

31:34.932 --> 31:36.099
Oh, okay, cool.

31:36.101 --> 31:39.469
Keep that up, and I won't
let you do the woman job

31:39.471 --> 31:40.937
of cleaning all the fish.

31:40.939 --> 31:43.840
Hey, we're almost down
by the secret spot there.

31:43.842 --> 31:46.709
Um, I hate to burst your bubble,
Mr. Manly,

31:46.711 --> 31:49.446
but your secret spot
isn't so secret.

31:49.448 --> 31:51.547
What?
Let me see.

31:51.549 --> 31:54.450
My colleagues are focusing

31:54.452 --> 31:55.985
on the bodies,

31:55.987 --> 31:59.855
but not the circumstances
surrounding their condition

31:59.857 --> 32:01.958
and discovery.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.094
I begged them
to look at the book,

32:05.096 --> 32:08.565
at the videos,

32:08.567 --> 32:11.401
and they dismiss me.

32:11.403 --> 32:12.969
But that hasn't stopped me.

32:12.971 --> 32:16.439
Well, what do we have here?
Finders keepers, I guess, huh?

32:16.441 --> 32:18.708
Hey, maybe we should go
somewhere else?

32:18.710 --> 32:21.611
I mean, if that guy comes back and
sees us messing with his stuff

32:21.613 --> 32:23.680
- he might get pissed, you know?
- He's not coming back.

32:23.682 --> 32:25.949
Look. He left his stuff
which is a bit weird

32:25.951 --> 32:27.917
because this rod
is very expensive.

32:27.919 --> 32:30.687
Hey, Ansel Adams, why don't you
come here for a close shot, huh?

32:30.689 --> 32:32.087
Look at this shit.

32:32.089 --> 32:34.657
Maybe he's off in the reeds
going to the bathroom.

32:34.659 --> 32:36.726
- Can we please leave?
- Off in the reeds, babe?

32:36.728 --> 32:39.696
Come on, I mean, look.
His ice is all melted.

32:39.698 --> 32:43.165
- This beer is...
- Oh my God.

32:43.167 --> 32:46.436
It's warm.
He ain't coming back.

32:46.438 --> 32:49.572
Okay, Sherlock, now that
you've used your CSI skills

32:49.574 --> 32:51.106
to give us the time
of death on the beer,

32:51.108 --> 32:54.579
- can we please go?
- All right, come on.

32:58.682 --> 33:00.583
- Come on!
- No, come on, right now.

33:00.585 --> 33:03.585
Let's get outta here, please.
Thank you.

33:03.587 --> 33:06.456
They found the fisherman.

33:06.458 --> 33:09.124
No one
reported him missing,

33:09.126 --> 33:11.428
but work colleagues said

33:11.430 --> 33:14.697
he had taken a week's
vacation to go fishing.

33:14.699 --> 33:17.699
Uh, he was a really good guy.

33:17.701 --> 33:19.102
Uh, very reliable,

33:19.104 --> 33:20.870
fun to hang out with.

33:20.872 --> 33:23.840
You know,
typical everyday guy.

33:23.842 --> 33:26.074
I saw him about
a week-and-a-half ago,

33:26.076 --> 33:28.812
he turned me onto
this great new fishing hole.

33:28.814 --> 33:30.979
Uh, went there,
had a few beers,

33:30.981 --> 33:32.817
you know, normal guy stuff.

33:35.019 --> 33:36.786
This is it.

33:36.788 --> 33:39.491
My new private fishing hole.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.025
Don't let the chain fool you.

33:42.027 --> 33:44.563
It is perfectly legal
to be in here.

33:51.536 --> 33:54.069
I don't know what we're
gonna catch first,

33:54.071 --> 33:57.675
a fish or a buzz, but I guess
it really doesn't matter, right?

34:01.579 --> 34:02.845
This place is great.

34:02.847 --> 34:05.515
I mean,
they just found his body,

34:05.517 --> 34:06.949
his skull was cracked open...

34:06.951 --> 34:08.818
His brains were exposed.

34:08.820 --> 34:10.652
I've never seen anything
quite like that.

34:10.655 --> 34:15.224
Well, why did
he leave his things?

34:15.226 --> 34:17.960
I mean, it's weird. He was like
trying to cook a fish over there.

34:17.963 --> 34:20.728
There was bones and shit but there
was like worms in the fucking ax.

34:20.731 --> 34:22.498
I think we should get
the fuck outta here.

34:22.501 --> 34:24.534
Look.
Someone's coming!

34:24.536 --> 34:25.833
What the fuck
is the matter with this Guy?

34:25.835 --> 34:27.570
Maybe he's hurt,
I don't know.

34:27.572 --> 34:29.137
Hey, buddy,
was that your shit back there?

34:29.139 --> 34:30.572
I'm sorry.
We just didn't...

34:30.574 --> 34:32.809
- Jesus Christ.
- What the fuck?

34:32.811 --> 34:36.547
Stop! Stop!
Stop! What the fuck...

34:48.226 --> 34:51.960
When authorities
discovered his body,

34:51.963 --> 34:55.565
they also discovered
the camera

34:55.567 --> 34:57.233
and the young man.

34:57.235 --> 35:00.135
The young woman
from the video,

35:00.137 --> 35:02.271
she wasn't found at the scene.

35:02.273 --> 35:04.574
She turned up days later.

35:04.576 --> 35:07.142
She tried to steal

35:07.144 --> 35:09.547
someone's tablet computer.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.853
Walked into a coffee shop,

35:16.855 --> 35:20.055
saw the tablet sitting
on a table,

35:20.057 --> 35:21.824
picked it up,

35:21.826 --> 35:24.126
walked out.

35:24.128 --> 35:26.565
Cops caught her
right outside.

35:30.168 --> 35:32.168
She didn't resist.

35:32.170 --> 35:35.304
She didn't say anything.

35:35.306 --> 35:36.940
She still hasn't.

35:36.942 --> 35:40.909
When the authorities found out
she had been flagged,

35:40.911 --> 35:42.744
they brought her here.

35:42.746 --> 35:46.215
They just got done
fighting over the two corpses.

35:46.217 --> 35:49.885
Now there's
a feeding frenzy over her.

35:49.887 --> 35:51.820
But I think
they're wasting their time.

35:51.822 --> 35:56.025
The answers
aren't in the bodies.

35:56.027 --> 35:57.961
They are in the book

35:57.963 --> 36:00.829
and the videos.

36:00.831 --> 36:03.701
And I think
I may have found...

36:06.938 --> 36:08.838
a connection.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.240
We have reports of the phenomena
in every country

36:11.242 --> 36:13.041
with shores
along the Atlantic.

36:13.043 --> 36:14.677
And it's spreading.

36:14.679 --> 36:16.211
We had our first
U.S. case inland.

36:16.213 --> 36:18.046
What happened?

36:18.048 --> 36:20.950
Poor bastard, in a
supermarket in Buffalo

36:20.952 --> 36:22.351
a guy worked
in the seafood section.

36:22.353 --> 36:24.086
He stabbed
his co-worker to death.

36:24.088 --> 36:26.655
He was caught at a bus station
trying to get to a Syracuse.

36:26.657 --> 36:28.023
He offered no resistance,

36:28.025 --> 36:29.825
just like the girl.

36:29.827 --> 36:31.693
If you let me talk to the girl,

36:31.695 --> 36:32.961
I can try to understand

36:32.963 --> 36:35.231
what's happening
to the victims mentally.

36:35.233 --> 36:38.034
I can try to find out what's
compelling them to the beach.

36:38.036 --> 36:40.836
We're moving
the specimen today for tests.

36:40.838 --> 36:43.805
No team member is getting near
her without protective clothing,

36:43.807 --> 36:45.907
because we don't
what we're dealing with.

36:45.909 --> 36:47.644
I know you've
been working hard,

36:47.646 --> 36:50.679
but you need to stop
with these theories, okay?

36:50.681 --> 36:52.215
You need to get
something to eat.

36:52.217 --> 36:54.851
You need to get some sleep.
You need to call your family.

36:54.853 --> 36:56.621
You need to...

36:57.989 --> 37:01.057
Wait. Are you recording
this conversation?

37:01.059 --> 37:03.159
- I'm keeping a record...
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?

37:03.161 --> 37:05.297
Turn that thing off.
Turn that thing off and...

37:09.000 --> 37:12.338
I've been put on a mandatory
leave of absence.

37:14.271 --> 37:18.041
I have to leave
all files behind...

37:18.043 --> 37:19.945
even this.

37:23.715 --> 37:26.318
I feel like I'm getting
closer to the truth.

37:27.719 --> 37:30.420
Good afternoon,
this is Ann Davis for News 7

37:30.422 --> 37:34.956
your local news and here
are our top stories for today.

37:34.958 --> 37:36.693
Six bodies
were found this morning

37:36.695 --> 37:39.996
at North Bay Beach
in an apparent mass murder.

37:39.998 --> 37:41.264
According to the police,

37:41.266 --> 37:43.132
the identities of these victims

37:43.134 --> 37:44.733
have not been disclosed

37:44.735 --> 37:46.869
as the brutality
of these murders

37:46.871 --> 37:50.405
have made some of the victims
unidentifiable.

37:50.407 --> 37:52.407
According to
the medical examiner

37:52.409 --> 37:56.079
the victims heads
seem to have exploded.

37:56.081 --> 37:59.315
This murder scene resembles
various other murders

37:59.317 --> 38:02.818
that have come across the news
in recent weeks.

38:02.820 --> 38:06.222
The police are investigating
any and all connections,

38:06.224 --> 38:10.258
and we will continue to report
any updates here on News 7

38:10.260 --> 38:12.831
as they come available.

38:19.971 --> 38:21.470
In unrelated news,

38:21.472 --> 38:23.940
two individuals believed to be
a man and a woman

38:23.942 --> 38:27.342
robbed the First National Bank
on Oak Street earlier today

38:27.344 --> 38:30.880
getting away with hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

38:30.882 --> 38:33.014
Local police are asking
for any information

38:33.016 --> 38:36.385
on these suspects
to call the police hotline

38:36.387 --> 38:39.287
and do not approach
these individuals

38:39.289 --> 38:42.393
as they may be
armed and dangerous.

39:10.121 --> 39:12.954
Is it rolling, Blake?

39:12.956 --> 39:15.760
Yeah, it's rolling.
It's our money now, bitches!

39:17.094 --> 39:18.561
Did you see them freak?

39:18.563 --> 39:20.796
I thought the bank teller
was gonna shit themselves!

39:20.798 --> 39:22.231
And the lady,
when I stole her diamonds.

39:22.233 --> 39:23.833
Fuck.

39:23.835 --> 39:25.967
Yeah, we take from the bank
and the customers

39:25.969 --> 39:27.202
for little old us.

39:27.204 --> 39:29.338
No doubt.

39:29.340 --> 39:32.909
- We're fucking bad asses.
- Holy shit.

39:32.911 --> 39:34.443
Holy shit.

39:34.445 --> 39:36.412
- Babe, check this out.
- Blake, get the camera.

39:36.414 --> 39:41.117
- Get the camera. I wanna get a close up.
- All right, I'll get it.

39:41.119 --> 39:42.354
Oh my God.

39:44.322 --> 39:45.824
Oh my God.

39:48.226 --> 39:50.358
Doesn't this
look pretty on me?

39:50.360 --> 39:51.963
You sexy bitch.

39:53.998 --> 39:56.132
Oh my God, Blake.

39:56.134 --> 39:58.771
There's so much money.

39:59.938 --> 40:02.170
Oh, wow.

40:02.172 --> 40:04.206
Oh my God.

40:04.208 --> 40:05.575
All right,
put the camera down.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.013
I want you to do me
on top of all this money.

40:14.219 --> 40:15.954
You are a crazy bitch.

40:20.190 --> 40:23.226
I fuckin' love you.

40:23.228 --> 40:26.295
We're gonna go into the marina
and we're gonna steal a boat

40:26.297 --> 40:30.233
and go wherever
the fuck we want.

40:32.070 --> 40:33.336
Who the fuck is that?

40:33.338 --> 40:34.973
Open the door!

40:38.108 --> 40:39.641
Open the door!
Let me in!

40:39.643 --> 40:41.276
What you want, motherfucker!

40:41.278 --> 40:42.545
It's Sheriff fuckin' Williams.
Let me in!

40:42.547 --> 40:44.546
There's some fuckin' crazy
people out here!

40:44.548 --> 40:47.018
Let me fuckin' in!
Open the fuckin' door!

40:49.219 --> 40:51.387
Oh my God.

40:51.389 --> 40:53.956
I got a gun.

40:53.958 --> 40:55.523
Blake, who is it?

40:55.525 --> 40:57.260
I think it's the cops.

40:57.262 --> 41:00.499
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Relax, baby, I got this.

41:05.168 --> 41:06.904
What the fuck?

41:09.606 --> 41:11.876
Hey come on, we gotta get
the fuck outta here.

41:13.945 --> 41:15.380
Come on, get dressed.

41:18.315 --> 41:20.218
Give me the fuckin' gun.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.487
- Get all the money.
- Leave the rest, come on.

41:24.489 --> 41:26.222
Come on, grab the bag.

41:26.224 --> 41:27.626
Stay behind me.

41:34.632 --> 41:37.970
- Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!
- No!

41:41.539 --> 41:45.474
I can't get the others
to study the book.

41:45.476 --> 41:49.314
They won't watch
and examine the videos.

41:53.952 --> 41:56.217
They will probably
file this all away

41:56.219 --> 41:58.356
as soon as I leave.

42:06.496 --> 42:09.634
Maybe that's the biggest irony.

42:11.469 --> 42:13.972
This was written by a madman.

42:15.273 --> 42:18.273
And he may have been
the sanest of us all.

42:18.275 --> 42:20.275
He was the only one capable

42:20.277 --> 42:22.711
of trying

42:22.713 --> 42:25.414
to make us understand

42:25.416 --> 42:27.148
what was out there.

42:27.150 --> 42:31.086
What if we're not dealing
with some mindless parasite

42:31.088 --> 42:33.755
turning hosts

42:33.757 --> 42:35.224
into brainless zombies?

42:35.226 --> 42:38.360
What if we're facing
an intelligence?

42:38.362 --> 42:41.666
What if the man knew for years
what was coming?

42:43.467 --> 42:45.467
He called himself a prophet.

42:45.469 --> 42:47.939
Maybe that is what he was.

42:59.483 --> 43:02.751
Maybe he was trying
to recruit the student

43:02.753 --> 43:06.557
to carry on
or help with his work.

43:10.228 --> 43:12.364
A messenger of sorts.

43:16.266 --> 43:20.336
Could Lucas have had an inkling

43:20.338 --> 43:23.742
of what fate
was in store for him?

43:25.275 --> 43:27.443
Shooting himself

43:27.445 --> 43:32.081
might have been the wisest
course of action.

43:32.083 --> 43:35.217
But why?

43:35.219 --> 43:38.356
What knowledge
drove him to that?

43:41.626 --> 43:43.394
Could it be...

44:14.192 --> 44:15.590
Why are you filming this?

44:15.592 --> 44:18.226
So the police will
know what happened.

44:18.228 --> 44:20.229
We're not murderers, Julie.

44:20.231 --> 44:22.231
Nobody's killing anybody, okay?

44:22.233 --> 44:25.200
I just need to talk to him.
That's all.

44:25.202 --> 44:27.806
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

44:30.307 --> 44:31.673
Her husband

44:31.675 --> 44:34.876
and all these people,
these were people we knew,

44:34.878 --> 44:36.345
they went down by the river,

44:36.347 --> 44:39.217
and they started
acting weird.

44:42.586 --> 44:46.155
We didn't really wanna talk
about what we were gonna do.

44:46.157 --> 44:47.692
We just knew it
was gonna get ugly.

44:48.626 --> 44:50.226
Julie, stay close.

44:50.228 --> 44:51.494
I'm gonna
talk with him, Will.

44:51.496 --> 44:52.894
- Julie!
- Julie! Julie!

44:52.896 --> 44:54.863
- Wait!
- Hey! Listen!

44:54.865 --> 44:56.831
- We can't be alone!
- We stay together!

44:56.833 --> 44:59.834
Stick with the plan,
you understand me?

44:59.836 --> 45:02.170
Anything bad happens,
I'm just gonna start shooting.

45:02.172 --> 45:03.905
Yeah, let's hope it
doesn't come to that, huh?

45:03.907 --> 45:05.342
Okay.

45:08.211 --> 45:09.612
Nick, it's me.

45:09.614 --> 45:12.751
Please look at me.
Nick, come home.

45:13.784 --> 45:15.217
I got you.

45:15.219 --> 45:17.318
Nick, please look at me.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.387
Nick, come home with me!

45:19.389 --> 45:20.523
Julie.

45:20.525 --> 45:22.891
Julie, step away from him.

45:22.893 --> 45:24.360
That is not Nick.

45:24.362 --> 45:25.894
- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know!

45:25.896 --> 45:27.632
Just stay calm and be quiet!

45:31.902 --> 45:33.469
What the fuck is this?

45:33.471 --> 45:35.373
I don't know.
Just keep your eyes on 'em.

45:37.875 --> 45:40.342
Hey, I got a real clear shot.

45:40.344 --> 45:41.780
No, not with Julie there.

45:57.195 --> 45:58.894
- Will!
- Yeah?

45:58.896 --> 46:01.563
There's something in the water!

46:01.565 --> 46:03.434
You can see it in the video.

46:04.668 --> 46:06.969
I didn't get
the best shot of it,

46:06.971 --> 46:08.336
but it's big,

46:08.338 --> 46:11.308
dark, cloudy...

46:12.543 --> 46:14.876
and it's just
sort of writhing around.

46:14.878 --> 46:16.514
Julie, get away from him!

46:22.954 --> 46:24.556
Run!

46:26.523 --> 46:28.757
Get to the truck!
Let's go!

46:28.759 --> 46:30.461
Come on!

46:32.496 --> 46:35.731
So...

46:35.733 --> 46:37.469
I made it to the truck.

46:38.603 --> 46:40.305
I'm the only one.

46:42.005 --> 46:45.441
It was like
one big hivemind

46:45.443 --> 46:47.376
serving that thing...

46:47.378 --> 46:48.780
whatever it is.

46:50.581 --> 46:54.883
But I saw it...
we saw it...

46:54.885 --> 46:56.655
and it's on the video.

46:57.887 --> 47:01.356
I don't know what
that thing in the water was,

47:01.358 --> 47:04.528
but whatever it is...

47:05.862 --> 47:07.598
God have mercy our soul.

47:08.965 --> 47:11.733
Subject
returning to the workplace.

47:11.735 --> 47:14.003
Situation normal.

47:14.005 --> 47:16.771
What about the casualties?
Or The Specimen?

47:16.773 --> 47:20.742
They're not the mission.

47:20.744 --> 47:22.945
Staying on target.

47:22.947 --> 47:28.284
The patient...

47:28.286 --> 47:31.787
the specimen...

47:31.789 --> 47:34.789
whatever you want to call her...

47:34.791 --> 47:36.494
escaped.

47:48.005 --> 47:51.005
No one could have guessed

47:51.007 --> 47:54.311
she was capable of violence.

47:55.880 --> 47:59.947
She sent two to the hospital,

47:59.949 --> 48:02.753
killed two more.

48:04.855 --> 48:07.990
My supervisor...

48:07.992 --> 48:10.295
was among the dead.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.001
So it turns out...

48:19.003 --> 48:23.005
I'm not going
on mandatory leave...

48:23.007 --> 48:24.840
after all.

48:24.842 --> 48:30.347
He never got a chance
to put in the paperwork.

48:34.452 --> 48:37.820
The few remaining
team members

48:37.822 --> 48:39.921
are debating how she did it.

48:39.923 --> 48:44.059
You sound like a bunch
of pregnant fuckin' bitches!

48:44.061 --> 48:47.061
You're fucking crying
about this and this!

48:47.063 --> 48:48.863
Frank's fucking dead!

48:48.865 --> 48:50.865
Huh? HUH?

48:50.867 --> 48:54.036
If we're dealing
with an organism

48:54.038 --> 48:56.137
that burrows into the brain

48:56.139 --> 48:58.507
to control the host,

48:58.509 --> 49:03.380
maybe it can
also turn off pain.

49:18.695 --> 49:19.994
That the Specimen

49:19.996 --> 49:23.132
may have been
reaching for my laptop.

49:23.134 --> 49:27.135
She was skimming
NASA pages,

49:27.137 --> 49:30.639
sites of space travel
and theory,

49:30.641 --> 49:34.409
reading the biography pages
for astronauts

49:34.411 --> 49:35.677
and astrophysicists.

49:35.679 --> 49:39.882
She wanted
addresses and locations.

49:39.884 --> 49:41.450
What was she after?

49:41.452 --> 49:43.521
Who was she after?

49:45.889 --> 49:48.692
Was it all just random?

49:53.797 --> 49:56.965
I haven't spoken to my family

49:56.967 --> 50:00.869
in ages.

50:00.871 --> 50:03.775
I have a husband
and a daughter.

50:06.976 --> 50:08.776
It's been so long.

50:08.778 --> 50:10.945
Ahh!

50:10.947 --> 50:12.014
Trying to scare me?

50:12.016 --> 50:13.882
You think you're funny?

50:13.884 --> 50:15.784
- Play with the baby stick.
- Give me the stick.

50:15.786 --> 50:17.552
- No.
- Give...

50:17.554 --> 50:18.757
No.

50:19.856 --> 50:21.490
Whoa.

50:21.492 --> 50:23.891
Mom, I think I'm getting
a little big for the swing set.

50:23.893 --> 50:27.162
I close my eyes
to remember their faces.

50:27.164 --> 50:32.066
And I hope
they remember mine.

50:32.068 --> 50:34.470
I can't remember
the last time I slept.

50:34.472 --> 50:37.005
I can't take the nightmares.

50:37.007 --> 50:38.807
They're the kind
that wake you up

50:38.809 --> 50:40.208
in a cold sweat,

50:40.210 --> 50:43.679
leaving you
wondering where you are,

50:43.681 --> 50:46.514
how you got there,

50:46.516 --> 50:49.485
not knowing whether the dream

50:49.487 --> 50:52.019
was the true reality

50:52.021 --> 50:54.121
you just snapped out of.

50:54.123 --> 50:56.758
But there is this déjà vu

50:56.760 --> 50:58.126
nagging at me.

50:58.128 --> 51:01.063
But it leaves the impression

51:01.065 --> 51:06.001
of somewhere and something wet

51:06.003 --> 51:09.173
and cold and old...

51:12.108 --> 51:14.943
Somewhere and something

51:14.945 --> 51:16.713
familiar.

51:23.887 --> 51:28.090
And it's coming from darkness.

51:28.092 --> 51:30.695
And I'm waiting for it.

51:36.766 --> 51:38.735
It's waiting for me.

52:34.090 --> 52:37.027
And then he said,
"Where is the toast?"

52:40.697 --> 52:42.965
Hell's coming!

52:42.967 --> 52:44.269
Shit!

53:08.759 --> 53:13.028
This will be my last entry.

53:13.030 --> 53:16.197
I don't say that
to be melodramatic.

53:16.199 --> 53:19.400
The word came down.

53:19.402 --> 53:23.137
The military is coming
to take over everything.

53:23.139 --> 53:26.742
I don't know
what they expect to find.

53:26.744 --> 53:30.048
I guess they
are as desperate as I am.

53:31.949 --> 53:35.416
My colleagues,
what few were left,

53:35.418 --> 53:37.753
are gone.

53:37.755 --> 53:41.222
They gave up, retreated.

53:41.224 --> 53:43.325
They don't know
what they're dealing with.

53:43.327 --> 53:46.228
They just know it's winning.

53:46.230 --> 53:48.195
So I'm alone here.

53:48.197 --> 53:51.199
Which is a cruel twist.

53:51.201 --> 53:55.336
Because I finally have
what I was looking for.

53:55.338 --> 53:59.775
And there is no one
to show it to.

53:59.777 --> 54:01.742
Not that it matters.

54:01.744 --> 54:04.014
They still wouldn't
believe me.

54:08.719 --> 54:11.385
I doubt the military

54:11.387 --> 54:14.125
will be any more open-minded.

54:19.730 --> 54:21.733
Let's get the hell out of here.

54:26.302 --> 54:28.806
They still wouldn't believe me.

54:31.108 --> 54:36.778
I'll be gone
before the soldiers roll in.

54:36.780 --> 54:39.947
They can have this place.

54:39.949 --> 54:42.686
They should rot here.

54:44.887 --> 54:47.822
I'm going to my family.

54:47.824 --> 54:50.761
I'm, I'm going home.

54:55.264 --> 54:58.432
But I need
to show this first.

54:58.434 --> 54:59.900
Yo, check it out.

54:59.902 --> 55:01.705
- What?
- What?

55:03.740 --> 55:07.141
Dude, I don't like...
whoa, I don't like this.

55:07.143 --> 55:08.776
What?
Why am I stopping?

55:08.778 --> 55:10.878
It's a chick.

55:10.880 --> 55:12.880
- Oh, of course.
- Hey.

55:12.882 --> 55:14.117
You okay?

55:15.219 --> 55:16.421
Where're you headed?

55:17.253 --> 55:19.086
I think I hear him speak.

55:19.088 --> 55:20.921
Location home.

55:20.923 --> 55:24.092
- Uh, we can give you a ride.
- No! No, I'm sorry.

55:24.094 --> 55:25.526
We can't...
are you fucking kidding?

55:25.528 --> 55:28.262
Hey come on, come on.
Don't be such a little bitch.

55:28.264 --> 55:30.831
We're going to the beach.

55:30.833 --> 55:32.833
Are my words in right?

55:32.835 --> 55:34.469
Am I meaning there, too?

55:34.471 --> 55:37.171
- Home please.
- Whoa, whoa, crazy lady!

55:37.173 --> 55:40.275
No man, she needs
to go to a hospital.

55:40.277 --> 55:42.043
Nah, she just needs a beer.

55:42.045 --> 55:43.945
I'm not fucking around!

55:43.947 --> 55:47.816
Well, look. Tell me this
girl doesn't like to party.

55:47.818 --> 55:49.217
She's all coked up.

55:49.219 --> 55:50.519
Maybe she has something on her.
Check her.

55:50.521 --> 55:53.287
- Guys, this is not cool.
- No fucking way.

55:53.289 --> 55:55.289
I am not checking her.
She stinks.

55:55.291 --> 55:57.992
Don't be such a pussy.
She's passed out.

55:57.994 --> 55:59.827
Who cares
what she smells like.

55:59.829 --> 56:01.530
You know you'll bang her
if you get the chance.

56:01.532 --> 56:03.532
I hear you
and someone understands me.

56:03.534 --> 56:06.434
Okay, asshole. Somebody just
give me a tissue please.

56:06.436 --> 56:08.269
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

56:08.271 --> 56:09.804
What do you mean what?
Look at her.

56:09.806 --> 56:11.572
She could barely walk.
Look, I swear to God.

56:11.574 --> 56:13.340
- If you guys do anything to her.
- Seriously.

56:13.342 --> 56:15.911
- What's your fucking problem?
- What's my problem?

56:15.913 --> 56:19.847
Hey, look at me. Jail.
Jail's my fucking problem, man.

56:19.849 --> 56:21.383
Look, you don't get it,
do you?

56:21.385 --> 56:24.119
She's in no condition.
And if you do anything to her,

56:24.121 --> 56:26.521
anything at all
and she reports it to the cops,

56:26.523 --> 56:30.124
- you're fucked.
- When did you become such a fag?

56:30.126 --> 56:33.195
Uh, fuck you.
Nah, I'm outta here.

56:33.197 --> 56:34.528
Whoa.
Where the fuck are you going?

56:34.530 --> 56:37.164
- Anywhere but here.
- Here motherfucker.

56:37.166 --> 56:39.434
Yeah, you're walking.

56:39.436 --> 56:41.139
Fuck you.

56:42.405 --> 56:43.871
Shit.

56:43.873 --> 56:48.011
Waves.

57:02.592 --> 57:06.260
This is gonna be awesome.
She's so fucked up.

57:06.262 --> 57:08.463
Are you ready not to wait?

57:08.465 --> 57:10.434
I'm ready for whatever.

57:13.135 --> 57:15.572
The boy she had kissed
was gone.

57:18.876 --> 57:20.344
Dude, what's wrong?

57:21.545 --> 57:23.380
What the fuck?

57:24.414 --> 57:26.248
Oh God.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.016
What the fuck
did you do to him?

57:28.018 --> 57:29.383
You fucking whore!

57:29.385 --> 57:31.586
The other boy,

57:31.588 --> 57:33.954
the boy who was filming

57:33.956 --> 57:36.090
was lying there on the beach,

57:36.092 --> 57:38.228
clutching the camera.

57:56.947 --> 57:59.016
He was alive...

58:01.585 --> 58:04.121
but he was institutionalized.

58:06.923 --> 58:09.523
I was able to find out where

58:09.525 --> 58:12.026
from the authorities

58:12.028 --> 58:14.065
who sent me the video.

58:19.235 --> 58:23.137
They told me that
he hasn't spoken a single word

58:23.139 --> 58:25.407
since being found on the beach.

58:25.409 --> 58:31.079
So I asked questions
about him and his treatment.

58:31.081 --> 58:35.717
They told me
he just sits alone all day

58:35.719 --> 58:39.387
and draws
odd pictures and shapes.

58:39.389 --> 58:42.958
They think it's all meaningless

58:42.960 --> 58:48.162
but they also see it
as therapeutic.

58:48.164 --> 58:51.132
I asked if I could see

58:51.134 --> 58:53.133
some of his drawings.

58:53.135 --> 58:56.239
And they sent me this.

59:14.023 --> 59:17.057
A homeless man.

59:17.059 --> 59:19.394
A teenager.

59:19.396 --> 59:21.396
They never met.

59:21.398 --> 59:25.233
They had no mutual
acquaintances.

59:25.235 --> 59:28.235
They lived near
the Atlantic Ocean,

59:28.237 --> 59:32.606
but hundreds of miles apart.

59:32.608 --> 59:35.744
How is that

59:35.746 --> 59:38.579
they both drew the same thing?

59:38.581 --> 59:41.282
But I don't believe it,

59:41.284 --> 59:43.017
and I don't care anymore.

59:43.019 --> 59:46.220
I don't care.

59:46.222 --> 59:50.090
The nightmares are worse.

59:50.092 --> 59:54.695
Even when I don't sleep,

59:54.697 --> 59:58.402
there isn't any escape.

59:59.702 --> 01:00:01.538
Oh my God!

01:00:22.224 --> 01:00:24.494
I just want to go home.

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:32.103
I'm going home.

01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:56.490
Hey, stop where you are!

01:00:56.492 --> 01:00:58.392
- Put that down.
- I need to get out of here.

01:00:58.394 --> 01:01:00.528
- I said put that down!
- Easy, Johnson.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.597
Johnson, stand down.

01:01:03.599 --> 01:01:06.400
She should just surrender.

01:01:06.402 --> 01:01:08.202
You need to come with us now.

01:01:08.204 --> 01:01:09.771
- I need to get out.
- Negative.

01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:12.106
The facility's in lockdown.

01:01:12.108 --> 01:01:13.374
No need to worry.

01:01:13.376 --> 01:01:14.708
We're debriefing
all remaining staff,

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.211
and collecting all research.

01:01:16.213 --> 01:01:18.713
I have to get home
to my daughter.

01:01:18.715 --> 01:01:22.150
Hand those documents over now
and come with us.

01:01:22.152 --> 01:01:24.786
I'm not finished with it.

01:01:24.788 --> 01:01:27.791
We can't risk anything
getting out of this facility.

01:01:29.659 --> 01:01:31.525
What?

01:01:31.527 --> 01:01:33.528
You can't do this.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.396
I'm afraid I don't
have any choice.

01:01:36.398 --> 01:01:38.134
Orders.

01:01:39.302 --> 01:01:41.802
Johnson, Rodriquez,
secure anyone you find.

01:01:41.804 --> 01:01:43.271
Will do.

01:01:43.273 --> 01:01:44.671
Reinforcements
should be here shortly.

01:01:44.673 --> 01:01:46.309
Yes, sir.

01:02:02.592 --> 01:02:03.858
Are they dead?

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.860
He definitely is.
They are, too.

01:02:06.862 --> 01:02:09.329
Are you all right, huh?

01:02:09.331 --> 01:02:11.331
You're the detective
from the video.

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.267
You're the one
who sent us this.

01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:14.802
- Yeah.
- We need to get out of here.

01:02:14.804 --> 01:02:17.871
Did you hear everything I said?
Did you hear what the guy said?

01:02:17.873 --> 01:02:19.606
Reinforcements are coming.

01:02:19.608 --> 01:02:22.776
I'd be a death sentence
to go that way anyway.

01:02:22.778 --> 01:02:25.512
So is there another exit?

01:02:25.514 --> 01:02:26.780
Yeah?

01:02:26.782 --> 01:02:28.184
Is it nearby?

01:02:29.351 --> 01:02:30.386
Yeah?

01:02:31.521 --> 01:02:32.787
You're free to go.

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:36.657
But first, you gotta
give me that book, okay?

01:02:36.659 --> 01:02:37.858
What?

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.195
You gotta give me
that book, okay?

01:02:40.197 --> 01:02:41.595
- What?
- The book.

01:02:41.597 --> 01:02:44.264
It's been haunting me.
I'm hearing voices.

01:02:44.266 --> 01:02:45.666
They were soft at first,

01:02:45.668 --> 01:02:47.568
but now they're getting
louder and more insistent.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:50.237
That book called me here.
It's found this fuckin' place.

01:02:50.239 --> 01:02:52.273
I hear the voices, too.

01:02:52.275 --> 01:02:54.541
No, you don't. You're full of shit.
You do not.

01:02:54.543 --> 01:02:56.711
That book had called me here
to serve it,

01:02:56.713 --> 01:02:59.447
to protect it or something.

01:02:59.449 --> 01:03:00.715
But I say, fuck it.

01:03:00.717 --> 01:03:02.416
I'm here to destroy it.

01:03:02.418 --> 01:03:03.684
No.

01:03:03.686 --> 01:03:05.788
I tried.
You can't.

01:03:07.623 --> 01:03:09.791
What?
Hey, look.

01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:11.358
I don't wanna
argue with you,

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.494
and, frankly,
I don't have the fuckin' time.

01:03:13.496 --> 01:03:17.398
All right, but my life
has been fucked up

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.932
ever since that book
came into it.

01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:22.369
And so it's gonna end
right here, right now.

01:03:22.371 --> 01:03:24.271
It's too valuable to destroy.

01:03:24.273 --> 01:03:27.275
- What do you mean?
- I've been studying this.

01:03:27.277 --> 01:03:28.943
Whatever's going on,

01:03:28.945 --> 01:03:31.949
this book is the key
to understanding it.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:36.252
Maybe even stopping it.

01:03:37.987 --> 01:03:39.554
Really?

01:03:39.556 --> 01:03:42.257
If you're saying to me,
I mean, are you saying to me,

01:03:42.259 --> 01:03:44.525
that that book,
this book here...

01:03:44.527 --> 01:03:45.793
will make it better?

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:49.896
All right.
Okay, listen.

01:03:49.898 --> 01:03:52.666
You take it
and you will leave

01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:55.836
and you will sneak out of
here and you're clever,

01:03:55.838 --> 01:03:59.307
and you get the fuck away
and you live.

01:03:59.309 --> 01:04:01.376
You understand me?
You live.

01:04:01.378 --> 01:04:03.311
All right?
You can go.

01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:05.313
- You're not coming?
- No, I'm not.

01:04:05.315 --> 01:04:07.014
I'm gonna stay
and buy you some time.

01:04:07.016 --> 01:04:08.583
Handle these guys
with their guns, okay?

01:04:08.585 --> 01:04:10.017
I understand that shit.
That's what I'm good at.

01:04:10.019 --> 01:04:11.619
It's normal to me.

01:04:11.621 --> 01:04:14.054
Okay, that shit outside,
whatever's going on out there,

01:04:14.056 --> 01:04:16.923
we're going to hell anyway,
right?

01:04:16.925 --> 01:04:18.559
We won't need to.

01:04:18.561 --> 01:04:20.394
Hell is coming to us.

01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:21.798
Go!

01:04:48.057 --> 01:04:51.325
- Do you wanna try to stop her?
- Negative.

01:04:51.327 --> 01:04:53.797
She's finally leading us
to the Higher Intelligence.

01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:57.532
Yeah, but you
know what's gonna happen

01:04:57.534 --> 01:04:58.666
when she goes home.

01:04:58.668 --> 01:05:00.802
Our task is
to observe and report.

01:05:00.804 --> 01:05:02.840
End of conversation.

01:05:19.922 --> 01:05:24.659
And here we have dad who thinks he's
a 19-year-old college sophomore.

01:05:24.661 --> 01:05:26.059
What do you want?

01:05:26.061 --> 01:05:28.128
I wanna know why you have
a mid-life crisis mobile.

01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:30.130
I don't have
a mid-life crisis mobile, okay?

01:05:30.132 --> 01:05:32.934
It's, it's good on gas
and it gets me around.

01:05:32.936 --> 01:05:34.668
And it makes you
look like a kid.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.037
What do you want?

01:05:36.039 --> 01:05:37.905
I think you're trying to
impress the neighbor.

01:05:37.907 --> 01:05:40.074
Go... play in traffic
or something.

01:05:40.076 --> 01:05:42.976
- - My name is
Daniela Belea. I live on Maple Lane

01:05:42.978 --> 01:05:45.512
- Middleton, New Jersey.
- Uh, what is that?

01:05:45.514 --> 01:05:47.782
I don't know, Dad. There's some
crazy lady banging on the door.

01:05:47.784 --> 01:05:49.083
- What are you doing?
- I'm filming it

01:05:49.085 --> 01:05:50.550
in case we have
to show the cops.

01:05:50.552 --> 01:05:51.985
- Cops? Hello?
- Grab your things!

01:05:51.987 --> 01:05:53.454
- Can I help...
- Grab your things!

01:05:53.456 --> 01:05:55.021
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- We need to go!

01:05:55.023 --> 01:05:56.624
- What're you doing?
- It's all in here,

01:05:56.626 --> 01:05:58.959
but there's no time to explain!
We need to head west.

01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:00.862
You need to get out
of my house right now!

01:06:00.864 --> 01:06:02.963
Your house?
What do you mean?

01:06:02.965 --> 01:06:05.800
Ma'am, I don't know if you're high or
if you're crazy or if you're drunk,

01:06:05.802 --> 01:06:07.534
but you need to leave
right now!

01:06:07.536 --> 01:06:08.802
It's our house.
It's me.

01:06:08.804 --> 01:06:10.570
Why are acting like
you don't know me?

01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:11.838
Because I don't,
I don't.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.141
- You do.
- No, look, I have seen...

01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:15.075
- You do know me. It's me.
- No, I don't.

01:06:15.077 --> 01:06:16.811
I've seen you around the
neighborhood jogging before, yes,

01:06:16.813 --> 01:06:18.780
but I don't know your name,
I don't know where you're from.

01:06:18.782 --> 01:06:20.081
Now if you do not
leave right now,

01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:21.682
- I am calling the police.
- What?

01:06:21.684 --> 01:06:24.786
What are you talking about?
It's me, sweetie.

01:06:24.788 --> 01:06:26.653
I'm your wife.

01:06:26.655 --> 01:06:28.121
What's wrong with you?

01:06:28.123 --> 01:06:29.891
- Dad.
- Pumpkin?

01:06:29.893 --> 01:06:31.425
- It's me. It's Mommy.
- Dad!

01:06:31.427 --> 01:06:33.528
What's wrong with you?
Okay, I'm a widower.

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:36.930
My wife... her mom...
died five years ago, okay?

01:06:36.932 --> 01:06:38.800
Oh, no, that can't be.

01:06:38.802 --> 01:06:41.903
You need to leave right
now or I'm calling the police.

01:06:41.905 --> 01:06:43.204
- I don't know,
I think she's high or...

01:06:43.206 --> 01:06:44.539
- I don't want to do this.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.173
- Please.
- Get back. Get back.

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:49.476
Miss, Miss.
She's bleeding.

01:06:49.478 --> 01:06:52.512
Miss, let me help you, okay,
let me call you an ambulance.

01:06:52.514 --> 01:06:53.914
- Run!
- Let me get you some help.

01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:54.981
- Please.
- Before it's too late.

01:06:54.983 --> 01:06:57.684
- Let me help you.
- Run.

01:07:09.798 --> 01:07:12.101
I need your phone.

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.983
Now the real work begins.

01:07:33.623 --> 01:07:35.159
What have I done?

01:07:37.527 --> 01:07:41.097
If that is not my family,
so who are they?

01:07:44.634 --> 01:07:46.170
Where's my home?

01:07:48.771 --> 01:07:51.873
I just keep hearing it,
home, home.

01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:54.210
Get out of my head!

01:07:57.179 --> 01:07:58.548
Shut up.

01:08:02.184 --> 01:08:04.918
Where's my house?

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.054
It needs to be
over here somewhere.

01:08:07.056 --> 01:08:09.525
I know I live over here.

01:08:11.193 --> 01:08:12.929
Where's my home?

01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:16.934
I hear it.

01:08:19.202 --> 01:08:22.538
I hear home, home, home.

01:09:08.015 --> 01:09:09.853
My home.

01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:16.193
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:19.194
Home.

01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:27.033
Messiah has come.

01:09:27.036 --> 01:09:29.636
Reveal the One Who Walks Beyond.

01:09:29.639 --> 01:09:31.705
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:34.008
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:36.643
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:38.912
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:38.913 --> 01:09:41.781
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:41.783 --> 01:09:43.384
- Home.
- Home.

01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:52.792
Hey! Get up here!

01:09:52.795 --> 01:09:55.028
I got a truck. This place is
crawling with these things!

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.600
I can get us to safety.
Come on.

01:10:05.007 --> 01:10:06.706
Hey.

01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:09.309
I'm not crazy.

01:10:09.311 --> 01:10:12.379
I've seen that thing
with my own two eyes.

01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:13.916
I can help.

01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:28.198
Obstacle defeated.
Subject free to continue.

01:11:14.777 --> 01:11:16.210
I'm sorry for your loss,

01:11:16.212 --> 01:11:18.845
but I'm gonna need to ask you
a few questions.

01:11:18.847 --> 01:11:20.313
So if you could
just help me out.

01:11:20.315 --> 01:11:22.249
I'm trying to understand
what happened to you today.

01:11:22.251 --> 01:11:23.854
Excuse me please.

01:11:30.059 --> 01:11:32.992
- No sir.
- No! No!

01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:35.364
Jesus, get him off me!

01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:47.875
Wait.

01:11:47.877 --> 01:11:49.777
Don't go.

01:11:49.779 --> 01:11:51.214
You...

01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:55.284
I recognize you.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.420
I do.

01:12:00.422 --> 01:12:03.893
Your the one who gave
the two students this.

01:12:06.796 --> 01:12:09.196
I knew you before that.

01:12:09.198 --> 01:12:10.934
What?

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.367
Mommy.

01:12:14.369 --> 01:12:15.835
What?

01:12:15.837 --> 01:12:17.340
What did you call me?

01:12:19.274 --> 01:12:21.174
Mommy?

01:12:21.176 --> 01:12:23.179
They wouldn't
let you keep me.

01:12:25.014 --> 01:12:28.782
They did what they had to do
and then they released you.

01:12:28.784 --> 01:12:30.284
And people said that you
had lost your way,

01:12:30.286 --> 01:12:33.056
- but I knew it wasn't true.
- Why are you doing that to me?

01:12:35.358 --> 01:12:38.092
They came in the boat.

01:12:38.094 --> 01:12:40.827
And they killed daddy.

01:12:40.829 --> 01:12:42.399
And they took you.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:46.267
Oh my God.

01:12:46.269 --> 01:12:48.137
Oh my God.

01:12:52.207 --> 01:12:54.076
I can believe...

01:12:55.211 --> 01:12:57.844
Oh, no.
They made me their prophet.

01:12:57.846 --> 01:13:00.580
They made you their messiah.

01:13:00.582 --> 01:13:02.085
The chose you.

01:13:03.586 --> 01:13:05.518
I never wanted that.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.088
Please.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:10.391
You never wanted that?

01:13:10.393 --> 01:13:12.492
Kill me.

01:13:12.494 --> 01:13:14.495
Please kill me.

01:13:14.497 --> 01:13:15.963
You never wanted that.

01:13:15.965 --> 01:13:18.398
No, I want you.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.967
I wanted you.

01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:21.335
You don't want me!

01:13:21.337 --> 01:13:24.905
- I love you.
- You don't want me!

01:13:24.907 --> 01:13:26.440
I didn't have any control.

01:13:26.442 --> 01:13:29.043
I want you.
I love you.

01:13:29.045 --> 01:13:32.213
They're in my head, mommy.
They're in my head, mommy.

01:13:32.215 --> 01:13:34.848
- I love you.
- For years.

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:37.384
Baby, I know.
I know, baby.

01:13:37.386 --> 01:13:38.585
I know.

01:13:38.587 --> 01:13:40.920
They chose you.

01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:42.488
- I was weak.
- They chose you.

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:45.992
And now your job is done.

01:13:45.994 --> 01:13:47.494
- Come with me.
- It's too late.

01:13:47.496 --> 01:13:49.597
Come with me please.

01:13:49.599 --> 01:13:52.566
It's too late.
Mommy, it's too late.

01:13:52.568 --> 01:13:55.268
It's not too late.

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:57.905
- It's too late.
- It's not too late.

01:13:57.907 --> 01:13:59.906
Please.

01:13:59.908 --> 01:14:02.343
It's too late.

01:14:02.345 --> 01:14:04.143
- No!
- It's too late!

01:14:04.145 --> 01:14:08.048
No, it's not, it's not!
You come with me!

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:09.884
Please come with me.

01:14:09.886 --> 01:14:12.322
Please don't do this.

01:15:00.235 --> 01:15:01.468
This is it.

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:04.571
Finally what we came here for.
Stay focused.

01:15:04.573 --> 01:15:07.174
Miller, this situation is out
of control and dangerous.

01:15:07.176 --> 01:15:09.076
Johnson,
I'm calling it in.

01:15:09.078 --> 01:15:12.245
Headquarters is ready to send
military backup on my word.

01:15:12.247 --> 01:15:14.180
Stay focused.

01:15:14.182 --> 01:15:15.683
She is the key to the source.

01:15:15.685 --> 01:15:18.619
She's always been the key.

01:15:18.621 --> 01:15:21.591
Yeah well, I don't think
she's here alone.

01:15:24.193 --> 01:15:25.628
Johnson!

01:15:37.238 --> 01:15:38.973
What do you think
you're doing?

01:15:38.975 --> 01:15:40.974
Look, we don't want any trouble.

01:15:40.976 --> 01:15:43.110
Just in the wrong place.
That's it.

01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:45.611
Just tell your creatures
to let us go.

01:15:45.613 --> 01:15:47.613
I don't think so.

01:15:47.615 --> 01:15:49.616
I think you're after my mom.

01:15:49.618 --> 01:15:52.389
I think the CIA has been
tracking our every move.

01:15:54.256 --> 01:15:56.022
We know
what's you're going to do,

01:15:56.024 --> 01:15:59.058
- and we're gonna stop it.
- You don't know shit.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.629
And anyways,
it's too late.

01:16:02.631 --> 01:16:04.764
You're the boy from the boat.

01:16:04.766 --> 01:16:06.433
Hey, we're trying to find you.

01:16:06.435 --> 01:16:07.567
We tried to help you.

01:16:07.569 --> 01:16:09.570
You did?

01:16:09.572 --> 01:16:11.271
I was underground.

01:16:11.273 --> 01:16:13.040
Not all of our followers
survived.

01:16:13.042 --> 01:16:15.442
But the ones that did...

01:16:15.444 --> 01:16:17.143
are loyal.

01:16:17.145 --> 01:16:20.481
They're loyal to me,
to my mom...

01:16:20.483 --> 01:16:22.585
to the master.

01:16:27.055 --> 01:16:30.057
I know now the real reason

01:16:30.059 --> 01:16:34.193
why the government
hired me.

01:16:34.195 --> 01:16:36.429
They knew
I had a connection

01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:39.168
to the master.

01:16:40.703 --> 01:16:43.704
After the boat accident,

01:16:43.706 --> 01:16:48.174
I lost most of my memories

01:16:48.176 --> 01:16:52.211
especially of my real husband

01:16:52.213 --> 01:16:54.083
and my son.

01:17:10.733 --> 01:17:13.733
My son didn't get
the title right.

01:17:13.735 --> 01:17:15.468
The seas from whence they came?

01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:17.071
That's wrong.

01:17:17.073 --> 01:17:19.376
There's no "they."
There's only "it."

01:17:20.509 --> 01:17:23.177
And it's not from the seas.

01:17:23.179 --> 01:17:24.844
The seas
are where it is now,

01:17:24.846 --> 01:17:28.581
but that's not where
it comes from.

01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:32.186
It comes from somewhere else.

01:17:32.188 --> 01:17:35.289
It doesn't belong here.
It doesn't want to be here.

01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:38.424
It was ripped from a place
we'll never know.

01:17:38.426 --> 01:17:40.393
A place we'll never understand.

01:17:40.395 --> 01:17:42.329
It was here before all of us.

01:17:42.331 --> 01:17:44.164
I'm not a prophet.

01:17:44.166 --> 01:17:45.598
I'm the messiah.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.402
It is part of me equally.

01:17:48.404 --> 01:17:50.774
We are separate and one.

01:17:52.875 --> 01:17:55.209
It can force me to understand,

01:17:55.211 --> 01:17:59.112
and that's how I know
exactly what it is

01:17:59.114 --> 01:18:01.882
and exactly what it wants.

01:18:01.884 --> 01:18:04.351
It's just a new beginning.

01:18:04.353 --> 01:18:06.553
A new end.

01:18:06.555 --> 01:18:08.554
The wait is over.

01:18:08.556 --> 01:18:10.126
Its time is now.

01:18:22.438 --> 01:18:24.771
I'm the messiah chosen

01:18:24.773 --> 01:18:27.644
to show you what's coming.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.156
I wanted to go home.

01:18:42.158 --> 01:18:45.261
And it wants to go home, too.

01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:52.702
And only one of us
will get to do that now.

01:19:24.966 --> 01:19:27.901
Wait a minute.
Are you recording this?

01:19:27.903 --> 01:19:30.269
- - Are you
out of your goddamn mind?

01:19:30.271 --> 01:19:31.537
Turn that off.

01:19:31.539 --> 01:19:34.210
Please, erase all this.
Not cool.

01:19:52.661 --> 01:19:54.260
You better hope you're dead.

01:19:54.262 --> 01:19:55.765
Cut.

01:19:59.268 --> 01:20:01.701
And, action!

01:20:01.703 --> 01:20:03.570
Open this door!

01:20:03.572 --> 01:20:04.972
Open this fucking door!

01:20:04.974 --> 01:20:07.310
It's open already.
It should be locked.

01:20:23.725 --> 01:20:26.328
And, cut.
Uh, yeah, that it was great.

01:20:28.697 --> 01:20:30.964
No sound!

01:20:30.966 --> 01:20:32.598
- No sound!
- No sound! No sound!

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.971
No sound.

01:20:38.439 --> 01:20:40.540
But keep going,
but no sound.

01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:42.345
Action!

01:20:45.314 --> 01:20:46.649
We have been...

01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:50.450
We have been shar...

01:20:50.452 --> 01:20:51.652
Oh, fuck.

01:20:51.654 --> 01:20:53.323
We have been sharing...

01:20:57.693 --> 01:20:59.026
We have...

01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:02.396
We have been sharing
other information with...

01:21:02.398 --> 01:21:03.897
What the fuck!

01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:06.603
You guys getting me nervous,
man.

01:21:10.372 --> 01:21:12.039
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:14.508
Actual sound.

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:16.843
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

01:21:16.845 --> 01:21:20.583
- Two take seven.
- Rolling, rolling, get ready.

01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:24.518
Cut!
Let's kill it one to ten!

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.053
That was a six.
I want to see a ten.

01:21:27.055 --> 01:21:28.857
Go for it!

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:44.306
Action!

01:21:49.578 --> 01:21:50.843
I can see the light.

01:21:50.845 --> 01:21:52.478
I can see the light.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.746
Can you see the light?

01:21:53.748 --> 01:21:55.882
I can see the light.

01:21:55.884 --> 01:21:57.683
Right now you're saying,
I am God.

01:21:57.685 --> 01:21:59.119
I am God!

01:21:59.121 --> 01:22:02.723
You are God.

01:22:02.725 --> 01:22:04.090
Say, "I'm the Messiah."

01:22:04.092 --> 01:22:05.558
I'm the Messiah.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.827
You are the Messiah.

01:22:07.829 --> 01:22:09.629
Say, "You love me."

01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:12.568
- Do you love me?
- I love you.

01:22:23.145 --> 01:22:24.847
Roll camera.

01:22:27.682 --> 01:22:30.586
