[car horns honking]

00:11.553 --> 00:13.847
-[woman 1] Oh, no! Up there!
-[woman 2] It's gonna crash!

00:13.972 --> 00:15.140
[man] Don't look, don't look.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.311
[blimp operator screaming]

00:21.980 --> 00:23.940
[screaming]

00:24.024 --> 00:25.650
[people clamoring]

00:27.861 --> 00:28.778
Oh, no!

00:29.738 --> 00:31.448
[screams]

00:33.324 --> 00:34.617
What was that?

00:37.954 --> 00:41.166
Uh, there's a fire
on the blimp. We have to--

00:41.291 --> 00:42.584
[explosion]

00:46.129 --> 00:47.172
[people clamoring]

00:48.131 --> 00:49.299
[woman] Look!

00:54.429 --> 00:56.181
[blimp operator panting]

00:58.683 --> 01:00.518
[thuds]

01:00.602 --> 01:01.728
Is everyone okay?

01:01.853 --> 01:03.313
[traffic sounds resume]

01:05.357 --> 01:08.360
[clears throat]
I'll take that as a yes.

01:09.944 --> 01:12.197
Who... Who are you?

01:12.822 --> 01:13.907
Just call me--

01:14.032 --> 01:15.700
[Lois] Superman!

01:15.784 --> 01:18.703
[panting] I'd like
to interview you
for the Daily Planet.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.289
Uh, sorry. No comment.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.917
Uh, got to go...
Gotta go take care
of that blimp.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.336
Oh, come on. Not again.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.048
Superman, if I could just have
a minute of your time.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.341
[alarm blaring]

01:32.217 --> 01:33.759
[guards panting]

01:34.803 --> 01:35.887
[groans]

01:37.681 --> 01:38.556
[groans]

01:40.558 --> 01:42.519
-[Mist] All right. Listen up.
-[Rough House] Kyle!

01:44.396 --> 01:46.231
-[grunts]
-Have you found her yet?

01:46.356 --> 01:49.609
[Mist] How many times
do I have to tell you
not to use our real names

01:49.734 --> 01:51.945
while doing crimes,
Rough House?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.279
Oh. Sorry, Kyle.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.657
[Mist] I just... Ugh.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.158
I'll only ask once.

01:57.241 --> 01:59.452
Which jail cell
is Siobhan McDougal in?

01:59.577 --> 02:00.662
[Silver Banshee] Kyle?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.415
Albert?

02:03.498 --> 02:05.792
-[Mist] Sis!
-Oh, so she gets to use
our names?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.669
What are you guys doing here?

02:08.752 --> 02:12.465
Long story short,
a crazy lady gave us
stupid, powerful weapons.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.260
And we're busting you...
[strains] Out.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.511
[clanging, thudding]

02:18.096 --> 02:19.222
[Mist] For you.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.349
Amplifies sound.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.977
Aw, you guys.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.228
Mm!

02:25.311 --> 02:26.563
Missed you too, sis, but--

02:26.646 --> 02:28.690
[warden] Prisoner 839
and associates!

02:28.773 --> 02:31.735
Drop your weapons
and stand down.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.778
[Silver Banshee] Uh, no.

02:33.903 --> 02:34.904
What was that?

02:35.864 --> 02:36.990
I said...

02:37.115 --> 02:38.825
no!

02:38.950 --> 02:40.869
[distant explosion]

02:40.952 --> 02:42.954
[opening music playing]

03:06.186 --> 03:07.854
Late, late, I'm so late.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.359
Hey, Lo... [groans]

03:12.484 --> 03:13.693
[labored breathing]

03:17.655 --> 03:18.490
[groans]

03:19.407 --> 03:20.825
Uh, Lois, are you okay?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.285
You're not hurt, are you?

03:22.369 --> 03:25.538
I didn't see you.
I mean, I did,
but I got you coffee.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.791
[chuckles softly]
This is from Waid's Cafe.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.669
You said it was your favorite.
I happened to jog past.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.253
That's clear across the city.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.838
It was a long jog.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.048
Are you sure you're okay?

03:35.173 --> 03:37.841
I am now, thanks to you.

03:37.966 --> 03:40.970
And I really need this
after the morning I've had.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.182
Oh, uh, really? What were you,
uh, doing this morning?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.142
Oh, I'll tell you what.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.937
I've been trying to
interview Superman,
but he keeps running away.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.023
Seriously, what is that guy
so scared of?

03:52.148 --> 03:53.942
Well, just a guess.

03:54.025 --> 03:58.697
Maybe he doesn't want you
to find out all his secrets
and publish them?

03:58.822 --> 04:01.324
Yeah, but he doesn't know
that's my plan.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.159
Saying yes to an interview
is simple.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.871
Here, look, I'll be me
and you pretend to be Superman.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.874
Hello, Superman. Lois Lane,
reporter for the Daily Planet.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.419
[sputters] It's a pleasure,
Ms. Lane.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.255
Clark, come on.
With a little more confidence.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.757
It's a pleasure... ma'am, miss.

04:18.882 --> 04:22.721
You saved my life
and I want to know
more about you.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.890
It would mean the world to me
if you let me interview you.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.810
What do you say?

04:28.893 --> 04:34.107
If it was within my power,
I would do anything
for you, Lois.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.736
Well, see how easy that was?
So why can't that guy say it?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.447
[Jimmy] Back!
Back you monsters!

04:40.572 --> 04:41.740
[Clark] What's going on?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.825
[Steve] You're getting scooped
is what.

04:43.908 --> 04:44.868
Oh, no.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.745
[Grant laughs elegantly]

04:46.870 --> 04:52.082
Allow us to introduce
ourselves. Lights!

04:52.167 --> 04:55.462
You're talking
to the Daily Planet's
star news team.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.006
Sports reporter Steve Lombard.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.759
Award-winning journalism,
people-pleasing good looks!

05:00.884 --> 05:01.509
[grunts]

05:01.593 --> 05:03.470
[Jimmy yelps]

05:03.595 --> 05:07.307
Yeah, gossip
and human interest, Cat Grant.

05:07.432 --> 05:11.436
If you can't say
something nice, darling,
then come sit by me!

05:11.561 --> 05:12.771
But not too close.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.899
I'm not doing this.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.193
Ah, come on, Ronnie.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.652
They got to know
who's scooping them.

05:19.778 --> 05:23.406
No. We have real work
to do. [sighs]

05:23.490 --> 05:25.867
Ronnie Troupe,
investigative journalist.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.327
I apologize about Steve.

05:27.452 --> 05:31.915
He thinks scoop
means "to steal,"
which it doesn't, Steve.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.250
It just means getting a story
before another reporter.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.960
And I'm scooping this.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.295
-[Jimmy exclaims]
Not the murder board!
-Perry assigned...

05:37.420 --> 05:38.922
No. No, no, no, wait.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.632
You can't just...

05:40.757 --> 05:43.093
Harry assigned us
the Superman beat.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.637
He said you compiled research
we could use,

05:45.720 --> 05:48.139
so we'll take this
and get out of your hair.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.516
This isn't fair.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.558
The Superman story
we wrote was perfect.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.811
Look, you got a lucky break.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.230
But Perry wants real reporters
on this.

05:55.313 --> 05:59.150
We'll make sure you get
an additional reporting credit
when we're done.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.318
Thank you.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.570
-Scooped.
-[Lois scoffs]

06:02.654 --> 06:04.114
[door slams shut]

06:04.197 --> 06:06.783
Also, the copier's broken.
Please fix it by lunch.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.534
[Lois] Ugh.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.202
Lois, are you all right?

06:09.327 --> 06:12.455
I thought those pictures
would make Perry
take us seriously.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.374
But if that didn't work,

06:14.499 --> 06:19.713
then we'll have to beat
the Scoop Troop
and get to Superman first.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.048
And I'll get it on Flamebird.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.509
This could get me
to seven followers.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.302
This could be
a seven-follower day.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.555
I still think
we'd be better off
finding a different story.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.308
There are other big things
happening in Metropolis
besides Superman.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.601
Like what?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.020
[reporters chattering
indistinctly]

06:35.145 --> 06:37.147
[reporter 1] Turn it up.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.357
[Bethany on TV] ...to prisoners
at a press conference
earlier today.

06:39.482 --> 06:43.528
Suspects have reportedly used
unknown tech-weapons
to escape.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.364
That looks like the tech
Livewire had!

06:46.489 --> 06:49.075
That's what I've been calling
the electric-woman
on Flamebird.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.038
Livewire nearly destroyed
half the city
with just one crazy weapon.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.081
With three on the loose...

06:55.206 --> 06:57.876
I have to track down
those criminals and stop them.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.212
I mean, write about them.
I mean, we go to write
about them.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.881
This is the story
we should cover!

07:03.006 --> 07:04.674
We get the scoop
for the Planet.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.719
And then Perry will have
to take us seriously.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.513
What are we waiting for?
Lead on, Smallville.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.645
Huh. Didn't expect you
to give up on the Superman
story so easily.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.522
Who says I am? Hmph.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.275
[Bethany] This is Bethany Snow
for Channel 52 News,

07:22.400 --> 07:25.070
asking the question
we all have on our minds.

07:25.195 --> 07:29.407
With sci-fi weapons
and a Superman
becoming the norm,

07:29.491 --> 07:32.118
what is next for Metropolis?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.207
What is it?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.210
The last thing we got
from the crazy lady.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.545
Allow Kyle to demonstrate.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.839
Stand back.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.592
More.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.179
[beeps]

08:00.355 --> 08:01.690
Whoa.

08:01.773 --> 08:02.941
I know, right?

08:03.066 --> 08:05.110
-And this button turns it off.
-[beeps]

08:10.115 --> 08:11.449
Move!

08:11.574 --> 08:12.951
[weapon powers down]

08:17.288 --> 08:21.209
[Silver Banshee] Boys,
they've looked down
on us our whole lives.

08:21.292 --> 08:26.715
But now, with this,
we are about to get
the respect we deserve.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.967
What do you say?

08:29.926 --> 08:30.719
We say...

08:30.802 --> 08:33.221
[sighs in exasperation] Fine.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.975
[all] Intergang forever!

08:38.601 --> 08:40.937
Okay. We need to find out
all we can
about Siobhan McDougal,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.148
her accomplices and where
they could be going next.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.234
-Also, how to convince them
to let three interns...
-[buzzer sounds]

08:46.317 --> 08:47.819
...talk to the warden.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.612
And how to get her to reveal
the government's secret

08:49.696 --> 08:51.698
meta-human soldier program
on Flamebird.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.616
Uh, maybe not that one.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.119
Yeah, no. I can get us in,

08:56.202 --> 08:58.997
but you have to promise
not to be upset.

08:59.080 --> 08:59.998
Why would I...

09:03.668 --> 09:05.503
[gasps] You stole their badges?

09:05.587 --> 09:09.466
No, I borrowed them...
secretly.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.717
When they weren't looking.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.594
That's the definition
of stealing.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.138
There is no way me and Jimmy
are going to go along with--

09:15.221 --> 09:17.891
Dibs on anyone
who is not Steve.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.185
Ugh.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.937
Fine. I'm not doing this.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.564
Fine.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.150
Then we can go back
and brainstorm
how to interview Superman.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.529
I'm sorry. Who are you?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.239
[Lois laughs gracefully]

09:33.365 --> 09:36.409
We're the Daily Planet's
star news team.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.745
Cat Grant, human interest.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.957
If it's not real news,
then tell me all about it.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.043
Ronnie Troupe,
investigative journalist.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.253
A little patronizing,
but mostly professional.

09:49.089 --> 09:49.798
Steve.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.050
-[foot thuds]
-Sports.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.886
Anyway, we're here
about the breakout, darling.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.847
What can you tell us
about the escapee?

09:57.931 --> 10:01.893
[sighs] Exactly what I said
at the press conference.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.895
Siobhan's the leader
of Intergang.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.774
A crew of small-time crooks
who rob convenience stores.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.984
Kyle! Siobhan!
Cops are outside.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.821
[Mist]
Stop using our real names!

10:12.904 --> 10:15.407
Wait. Is that a camera?

10:15.490 --> 10:17.492
And they are bad at it.

10:17.575 --> 10:21.913
Siobhan spent most of her
time here yelling that one day
she'd land a big score.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.375
Wait, I don't remember
seeing you at the conference.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.087
We don't like to bring
attention to ourselves.
[chuckles nervously]

10:29.170 --> 10:33.800
You literally pirouetted
into my office two seconds ago.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.385
[chuckles] Yeah, that was fun.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.430
Anyways, we were hoping
we could interview inmates,

10:38.555 --> 10:39.597
investigate the cell?

10:39.723 --> 10:41.016
Absolutely not.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.101
I can't let the press
waltz through my prison.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.146
-There's protocols,
as you know--
-[phone ringing]

10:46.271 --> 10:50.400
Yeah, No.
The Planet reporters
are already here.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.861
-Of course I'm sure.
I'm looking at them right--
-[door slams shut]

10:53.361 --> 10:54.320
Hmm.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.364
Okay, the exit
has to be somewhere.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.659
Once we get out,
we can regroup, try to
figure out something else.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.622
-Or we investigate the site
of the breakout.
-[camera shutter clicks]

11:04.748 --> 11:06.374
But the door's locked.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.002
Unless someone had
the warden's keycard.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.462
Oh, look.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.629
[chuckles]

11:11.755 --> 11:15.091
Wait a minute.
Was that a smile?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.510
-No, of course not.
-Uh-huh.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.096
I'm very perturbed
by your actions.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.891
-Of course.
-Because stealing is wrong.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.309
But?

11:26.770 --> 11:29.522
[door buzzes]

11:29.647 --> 11:31.524
-Okay, look for anything
that could give us a clue...
-[camera shutter clicks]

11:31.649 --> 11:34.152
...to where they might
be going next,
and let's do it fast.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.496
[grunts]

11:50.835 --> 11:52.379
[Clark]
She's written down times.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.547
Why?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.716
[warden] Yeah?
Well, find where
those imposters went, okay?

11:56.841 --> 11:57.759
And bring 'em back here.

11:57.842 --> 11:58.885
[Lois] Shoot.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.345
We got to get out of here.

12:03.598 --> 12:09.187
Okay. So, we know Siobhan
wants to do something big.
But what?

12:09.312 --> 12:14.234
Oh, my friends, this is why
you have me on your side.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.611
Bam! It was on the back
of her poster.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.863
[Lois] That's a bank layout.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.657
They're planning to rob a bank.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.991
But it won't be just any bank.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.035
Siobhan wants respect.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.329
That means it's going
to have to be the biggest
financial center in the city.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.123
The hardest one to crack.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.749
[Clark and Lois]
The Metropolitan City Bank.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.627
Those times,
they must be when
armored cars come in

12:32.711 --> 12:34.045
with cash transfers.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.382
It's a quarter till 5:00 now,
which means...

12:37.465 --> 12:39.884
[Lois] It's all going down
in the next 15 minutes.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.559
[Mist panting]

12:47.642 --> 12:49.102
[door slides open]

12:53.231 --> 12:54.149
Hmm.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.484
[electricity crackling]

13:01.072 --> 13:02.240
[customers exclaim]

13:19.049 --> 13:21.885
-Well, gang, what do you say?
-[bones crack]

13:21.968 --> 13:25.847
Let's get rich!

13:33.521 --> 13:37.108
-[Intergang cheering]
-[Silver Banshee] Yeah!

13:37.192 --> 13:39.027
That's what I'm talking about.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.404
[Mist] Hey, come on.
Let's get this and go.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.864
Relax, Mist.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.367
This isn't like
the smash and grabs
we did before.

13:45.450 --> 13:49.287
This time,
we have everything
under control.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.208
There it is.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.001
Stay here, out of sight
where it's safe.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.002
I'll call the authorities.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.046
And we'll go get captured.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.215
Wait. What?

14:00.298 --> 14:03.009
You call for help, Jimmy
and I will get taken hostage,

14:03.134 --> 14:05.178
and then Superman
will come and save us.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.390
That's when we'll get
our interview with him.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.183
This was your plan
the whole time?

14:10.308 --> 14:12.977
To find trouble,
then ambush Superman
when he flies in?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.063
I mean, it worked
when we did it with Livewire.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.523
You did that on purpose?

14:19.651 --> 14:21.111
[security guard] Hands up!

14:21.194 --> 14:23.321
The authorities
are on their way,
so just leave.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.078
[Clark] Watch out!

14:34.499 --> 14:36.167
[people clamoring]

14:37.252 --> 14:39.295
Clark, are you okay?

14:40.255 --> 14:41.881
Ms. Lane, Mr. Olsen.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.174
Get to safety.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.051
[whooshes]

14:48.847 --> 14:50.181
-[weapon powers down]
-Huh?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.853
For the well-being
of the people of Metropolis,

14:54.978 --> 14:56.896
I need you
to unfreeze everyone.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.358
How about no?

15:01.526 --> 15:02.527
[groans]

15:02.610 --> 15:03.945
[Superman straining]

15:10.326 --> 15:11.202
[grunts]

15:13.038 --> 15:14.164
Huh?

15:15.540 --> 15:16.541
Then I'll do it.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.670
-[Superman grunts and strains]
-[Rough House screams]

15:22.881 --> 15:24.841
Mist, do your thing.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.051
[Mist panting]

15:28.511 --> 15:29.387
[screams]

15:37.062 --> 15:40.315
Mist, this guy
ain't staying down.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.987
[electricity crackling]

15:46.071 --> 15:47.572
[weapon powering up]

15:47.655 --> 15:48.573
Gotcha!

15:48.698 --> 15:49.574
[Mist] Albert!

15:49.699 --> 15:50.575
Code names!

15:52.577 --> 15:53.411
[strains]

15:55.455 --> 15:56.581
Turn it off.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.665
[Mist] It's jammed.

15:59.793 --> 16:00.669
[grunts, strains]

16:03.421 --> 16:04.381
[grunts]

16:08.593 --> 16:09.636
[Mist] I can't move.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.304
I got it.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.098
[Mist] Wait,
not with the gloves.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.449
[Intergang screaming]

16:38.790 --> 16:41.126
-Everybody get back.
-[pedestrians] Oh, no!

16:42.419 --> 16:43.670
-[people screaming
and shouting]
-Go! Go!

16:49.092 --> 16:52.470
It's not stopping.
At this rate,
it'll overtake the whole city.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.764
What do we do?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.558
We evacuate everyone
and keep looking for Clark.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.435
Come on.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.108
[ice breaking]

17:05.191 --> 17:06.568
-Huh?
-[Silver Banshee screaming]

17:09.820 --> 17:11.656
No! Aah!

17:12.949 --> 17:14.159
[strains]

17:16.368 --> 17:19.079
-Huh?
-[Lois] Let's go people.
This way. Come on.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.500
[both gasp]

17:22.584 --> 17:24.544
Lois, Jimmy, run!

17:28.923 --> 17:29.758
How'd you...

17:30.675 --> 17:32.093
[pants]

17:38.975 --> 17:41.269
[grunts, strains]

17:41.853 --> 17:43.271
[yelling]

17:56.034 --> 17:57.452
[explosion]

17:59.704 --> 18:01.289
[groans weakly]

18:02.957 --> 18:03.792
Hmm?

18:14.135 --> 18:15.720
[people murmuring]

18:23.144 --> 18:26.189
I took out the machine
causing this, but the people
in the back got hit hard.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.482
They need help.

18:40.745 --> 18:41.871
[Jimmy] Clark!

18:41.955 --> 18:43.957
-Clark! Where are you?
-Clark! Come on, man.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.125
[sighs]

18:46.376 --> 18:48.420
Ms. Lane, Mr. Olsen.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.463
Superman. We can't find Clark.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.841
He's okay.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.594
I, uh... I saw him phoning
for help before I flew in.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.389
I understand you want
an interview, Ms. Lane?

19:00.682 --> 19:03.101
[Grant] Superman! Oh, hello!

19:03.184 --> 19:05.603
-Superman! Superman, it's me.
-[Steve] Yo, Superman!

19:05.729 --> 19:08.356
What do you say
we take this interview
elsewhere?

19:10.442 --> 19:11.443
[Lois gasps nervously]

19:11.526 --> 19:13.695
I'd say... hold on.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.238
[Lois screams]

19:15.321 --> 19:16.531
[camera shutter clicking]

19:22.287 --> 19:23.455
[gasps]

19:27.459 --> 19:29.002
Is this how you see the world?

19:29.127 --> 19:31.838
[gasps] It's beautiful.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.382
Yeah. Beautiful.

19:56.654 --> 20:01.159
Phew, well,
that's one way to, um...

20:01.284 --> 20:03.328
Um, sorry. [gasps]

20:04.746 --> 20:07.791
It's all right.
I'm... I'm nervous too.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.750
[chuckles nervously]

20:09.626 --> 20:11.836
Then why agree to this?

20:11.920 --> 20:15.840
I think we've
pretty firmly established,
I can't outrun you.

20:19.302 --> 20:23.682
Because when I told you
and Jimmy to save yourselves,
you stayed to help others.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.518
If you can face down
a city-destroying freeze ray,

20:26.643 --> 20:29.020
I think I can answer
a couple of questions.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.565
[hesitates, clears throat]

20:34.651 --> 20:36.569
Well, let's start
with the basics.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.363
Where do you come from?

20:38.446 --> 20:40.323
I don't know.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.202
How do your powers work?

20:44.285 --> 20:46.454
I'm still figuring that out.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.332
[sighs] Who are you?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.626
What are you?

20:51.710 --> 20:53.753
I'm kind of figuring
that out too.

20:53.878 --> 20:58.550
Ms. Lane, the truth is,
I'm still piecing together
who I am and what I can do.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.594
But at the end of the day,
I'm here to help the people
of Metropolis.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.558
That's what matters.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.731
[grunting, panting]

21:16.276 --> 21:17.402
Lois.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.070
Clark!

21:19.195 --> 21:20.780
You're all right.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.867
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you
my plan to interview Superman.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.871
-I put you in danger
because of it and I--
-[Clark] It's okay, Lois.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.831
I know how important
this is for you,

21:29.914 --> 21:31.624
and I promise,
from here on out,

21:31.750 --> 21:34.419
I'll do whatever I can
to help you get that interview.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.465
Actually, I just got it.

21:39.549 --> 21:42.594
Wow! You got the interview?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.095
That's incredible.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.765
I... I knew you'd get it.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.684
So, what'd you think
of Superman?

21:50.435 --> 21:52.312
Pretty great guy, right?

21:52.937 --> 21:55.273
Oh, he's a liar.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.817
Grea... What?
