WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:04.156
Come on, Max. Class is starting.

00:04.157 --> 00:06.559
I saved you a spot next to me.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.661
Be right there. Strapping in the girls.

00:08.662 --> 00:12.132
Lefty's a little cranky this morning.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.716
Thanks for getting these work out bands

00:13.717 --> 00:15.835
out of the Equinox dumpster.

00:15.836 --> 00:17.419
I was already in there. I had a meeting

00:17.420 --> 00:20.373
with my accountant.

00:20.374 --> 00:22.642
We're not doing great, by the way.

00:22.643 --> 00:25.478
We're gonna do
resistance work with them.

00:25.479 --> 00:27.493
I'm already resistant.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.883
I'm almost at violent.

00:29.884 --> 00:31.885
Do what I'm doing.

00:31.886 --> 00:35.321
Let my crack stick out?

00:35.322 --> 00:38.324
And pulse, and pulse, and pulse.

00:38.325 --> 00:40.693
Let me just get rid
of that pulse for you.

00:40.694 --> 00:43.563
Come on, Max, the heart machine
at Rite Aid said you were 80

00:43.564 --> 00:47.200
and printed you a
prescription for a wheelchair.

00:47.201 --> 00:50.003
On the count of three.

00:50.004 --> 00:54.239
One, two, three.

00:59.179 --> 01:01.781
Is there a bed on me?

01:01.782 --> 01:03.516
Get my wheelchair.

01:07.388 --> 01:13.506
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:14.894 --> 01:16.529
Hey, girls.

01:16.530 --> 01:19.231
Check out Barbara's new ride.

01:24.571 --> 01:26.239
We need help.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.577
And not just because Barbara
has a luxury SUV before I do.

01:30.578 --> 01:35.582
Ohh.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.217
Great workout.

01:37.218 --> 01:39.986
I'm gonna cool down with a bagel.

01:39.987 --> 01:42.956
No, I just came down here
to bring you your mail.

01:42.957 --> 01:45.173
And Barbara wanted to show off her car

01:45.174 --> 01:47.460
because you girls are poor.

01:47.461 --> 01:49.729
Overdue cell phone bill, electricity...

01:49.730 --> 01:52.265
Sophie, this mail is from a month ago.

01:52.266 --> 01:56.269
What? It's mail, not cottage cheese.

01:56.270 --> 01:58.244
Oh, wait. I think there might be

01:58.245 --> 02:00.780
a little cottage cheese in there.

02:00.781 --> 02:03.949
Got any of that for my bagel?

02:03.950 --> 02:05.751
Oh, my God. The movie they're making

02:05.752 --> 02:07.386
about my life is coming out.

02:07.387 --> 02:10.856
Is it called Good Will Boring?

02:10.857 --> 02:12.925
And Max, we're invited
to the press junket

02:12.926 --> 02:14.593
to promote the movie.

02:14.594 --> 02:16.562
In two days?

02:16.563 --> 02:18.798
Uh-oh.

02:18.799 --> 02:21.434
I don't even think my hair
girl could help you in time

02:21.435 --> 02:24.370
and she's got three hands.

02:24.371 --> 02:27.206
Sophie, I hope it's
not too late to RSVP.

02:27.207 --> 02:29.542
I was waiting for some
news about the movie.

02:29.543 --> 02:31.210
I thought it went to the wrong person.

02:31.211 --> 02:33.913
Like my 20s.

02:33.914 --> 02:37.283
Come on, Barbara. Let's
cruise the playground

02:37.284 --> 02:39.485
and make fun of babies in Chevy Volts.

02:41.888 --> 02:44.123
Uh, can Barbara drop me off at Equinox?

02:44.124 --> 02:46.758
They throw out the
expired Clif Bars at 3:30.

02:54.450 --> 02:56.417
Oh, Han, Max and I

02:56.418 --> 02:57.641
have to do press for my movie,

02:57.642 --> 02:59.120
so we can't work tomorrow.

02:59.121 --> 03:02.957
I get it. Why break
your six-year streak?

03:02.958 --> 03:04.592
I guess with all your movie money,

03:04.593 --> 03:07.028
you two can move on and
I can hire two waitresses

03:07.029 --> 03:09.764
who don't use my office
as a gambling hall.

03:09.765 --> 03:12.133
Han, Caroline already
spent all the movie money

03:12.134 --> 03:13.434
on the dessert bar.

03:13.435 --> 03:15.036
Also, I need your office in 20 minutes.

03:15.037 --> 03:17.538
We're interviewing a
new roulette dealer.

03:17.539 --> 03:19.040
Well, can you at least tell people

03:19.041 --> 03:22.710
not to put cigarettes
out on my family photos?

03:22.711 --> 03:26.581
There's a giant hole in my grandma.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.650
Ooh! They just sent a cast list.

03:28.651 --> 03:31.319
Guess who's playing me?

03:31.320 --> 03:34.422
Tess Walker.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.424
She is a very big...

03:36.425 --> 03:38.393
hold on, let me read
what she's a very big.

03:38.394 --> 03:42.028
If it's big-boobed,
they did zero research.

03:43.931 --> 03:46.634
Tess is from Australia.
She's a rising star

03:46.635 --> 03:50.805
and got her start in the
romantic comedy G'day Kate.

03:50.806 --> 03:53.941
Max, you're being played
by Vanessa Robinson.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.812
Not a name, but that's what they do.

03:57.813 --> 03:58.980
Vanessa Robinson?

03:58.981 --> 04:01.249
She's on my favorite Disney show,

04:01.250 --> 04:04.252
That's So Vanessa Robinson.

04:04.253 --> 04:07.855
How do they expect a Disney
goody-two-shoes to play me?

04:07.856 --> 04:10.091
She won't be realistic
playing high or drunk

04:10.092 --> 04:13.027
or fighting the bear from The Revenant.

04:13.028 --> 04:16.331
Ooh, Max, who's playing me?

04:16.332 --> 04:18.333
Michelle Kim?

04:18.334 --> 04:21.269
I'm being played by a woman?

04:21.269 --> 04:25.707
Calm down, not a woman.
It's an 11-year-old girl.

04:25.708 --> 04:28.509
And she's probably more
upset about it than you are.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.778
That's preposterous.
An 11-year-old girl

04:30.779 --> 04:32.447
couldn't own a diner.

04:32.448 --> 04:33.713
You do.

04:36.451 --> 04:38.319
Hey, guys. I picked up your lunch.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.788
There were two other orders
from customers in here.

04:40.789 --> 04:42.990
Hey.

04:42.991 --> 04:48.663
Bobby, Tess Walker is playing
me in the movie about me.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.832
From G'day Kate!

04:50.833 --> 04:54.035
Oh, yeah. She's Kate, right?

04:54.036 --> 04:56.537
Or or the one that says "G'day" to her?

04:56.538 --> 04:59.173
Either way, she's not as pretty as you.

04:59.174 --> 05:04.011
Ohh, you know exactly
what I tell you to say.

05:04.012 --> 05:07.382
Ooh, the fries are good from not here.

05:07.383 --> 05:08.882
Oleg, try these.

05:12.153 --> 05:13.721
Hey, Oleg.

05:13.722 --> 05:18.359
It says here you're being
played by Pete Chilton.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.728
My gosh, he's the one who
played the serial killer

05:20.729 --> 05:24.232
in that funny movie we saw.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.734
I hope the penis is accurate.

05:26.735 --> 05:28.603
This is a full frontal role, right?

05:28.604 --> 05:30.938
It is here.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.775
Oh, it doesn't look like
there's a Sophie character.

05:33.776 --> 05:35.777
Oh, but there is one named Pearl,

05:35.778 --> 05:39.781
a Black Polish woman who
works as the diner's cashier.

05:39.782 --> 05:41.783
What?

05:41.784 --> 05:45.787
They combined me with Earl?

05:45.788 --> 05:49.791
I mean, if I wanted to
be combined with someone,

05:49.792 --> 05:51.926
I wouldn't have given up a liver

05:51.927 --> 05:55.463
to be separated from my twin.

05:55.464 --> 05:57.231
Hey, they made me a woman?

05:57.232 --> 05:59.767
I haven't been a woman
since I was trying to outrun

05:59.768 --> 06:02.136
the mob with Marilyn Monroe.

06:02.137 --> 06:04.639
Oh, holy crap, Caroline.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.774
Your ex Candy Andy's a
character in the movie

06:06.775 --> 06:08.876
and he's gonna be at the press junkie.

06:08.877 --> 06:12.613
Junket. You're a junkie, get it right.

06:12.614 --> 06:14.782
And Candy Andy? Why is he in the movie?

06:14.783 --> 06:18.920
Shouldn't he be old enough to go
by Candrew Andrew at this point?

06:18.921 --> 06:21.255
Bobby, before you get crazy jealous,

06:21.256 --> 06:26.093
he is very handsome and I
went places with him sexually

06:26.094 --> 06:29.129
that I had never been before.

06:32.733 --> 06:36.337
But... ah, anyway, I'm with
you, now, and he's married.

06:36.338 --> 06:38.973
That's cool, I'm just...
I'm just not a jealous guy.

06:38.974 --> 06:42.510
I am confident in our
rock solid relationship.

06:42.511 --> 06:44.377
Well, that's very annoying.

06:48.850 --> 06:50.952
All these reporters and
photographers remind me

06:50.953 --> 06:52.920
of when I lost my baby teeth.

06:52.921 --> 06:56.591
Oh, my father left a
summer home under my pillow.

06:56.592 --> 07:00.428
I left my baby teeth in the
octagon with Ronda Rousey.

07:00.429 --> 07:01.863
This would be a great opportunity

07:01.864 --> 07:02.997
to plug our dessert bar.

07:02.998 --> 07:04.432
Let's do a lap and start

07:04.433 --> 07:06.534
whispering about ourselves
to get a buzz going.

07:06.535 --> 07:09.170
If you think I don't already
have a buzz going at 11:00 a.m.,

07:09.171 --> 07:10.838
then you don't know me.

07:10.839 --> 07:15.610
Oh, my God, that's the
Sophie and Earl mash-up.

07:15.611 --> 07:18.646
She was the football
coach on Girl Meets World!

07:18.647 --> 07:20.348
This is getting real!

07:20.349 --> 07:21.883
Caroline Channing?

07:21.884 --> 07:23.818
I'm Daisy. I'm with the PR team.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.853
Maybe you've heard of
me. Kylie Jenner threw

07:25.854 --> 07:27.822
a full can of Sprite
at my head last year.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.824
That's why my pupils are so big!

07:29.825 --> 07:32.793
Daisy, don't worry. I
am not high maintenance.

07:32.794 --> 07:34.395
How can I be sure that all photos of me

07:34.396 --> 07:37.632
are taken on the north side of my face?

07:37.633 --> 07:41.068
I'm Max. Uh, what does it mean
when you don't have pupils?

07:41.069 --> 07:43.204
You guys are so cute.

07:43.205 --> 07:44.739
Oh, I know you haven't seen the movie,

07:44.740 --> 07:46.807
so I'll give you a quick
rundown of what happens

07:46.808 --> 07:48.075
for press questions.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.011
Uh, let's see. You lose your money.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.547
Sad, sad, sad. And
then you meet this one.

07:52.548 --> 07:54.015
Sad, sad, sad.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.750
- You are so cute.
- Oh.

07:55.751 --> 07:57.652
It's not as much about
the two of you anymore.

07:57.653 --> 07:59.320
The storyline came
off a little lesbionic,

07:59.321 --> 08:01.422
which is kinda last year.

08:01.423 --> 08:03.524
I just came off a little lesbionic.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.060
Maggie won't stop calling me.

08:06.061 --> 08:07.595
Oh, my God.

08:07.596 --> 08:10.665
There's Tess. Oh, she's flawless.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.199
She's the perfect me.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.736
Tess, It's me! You, Caroline!

08:15.737 --> 08:17.939
Oh, and the young lady playing
you hasn't shown up yet.

08:17.940 --> 08:21.208
Oh, that's what the
real Max should've done.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.377
You're so cute. No, she went real method

08:23.378 --> 08:24.845
in researching the role of you.

08:24.846 --> 08:27.048
And now she's real into drugs.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.783
I'm so upset. You just can't tell

08:28.784 --> 08:32.119
because I'm heavily medicated.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.356
Hello, unattended bar.

08:35.357 --> 08:37.857
Caroline Channing in person.

08:37.859 --> 08:39.226
Oh, this must be what it was like

08:39.227 --> 08:42.063
when Julia Roberts met Erin Brockovich.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.365
Or the other way around.

08:44.366 --> 08:47.034
Oh, and this is Brent, the
actor playing Candy Andy.

08:47.035 --> 08:48.636
Should it be awkward between us

08:48.637 --> 08:50.571
since you're playing
one in a long string

08:50.572 --> 08:53.374
of two ex-boyfriends?

08:53.375 --> 08:54.674
Thanks.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.279
Thanks for having a tragic life

08:58.280 --> 09:00.247
so I could fall in love on screen.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.848
And off.

09:03.884 --> 09:06.554
Uh, see, I think
audiences would much rather

09:06.555 --> 09:09.056
see me wind up with,
let's say, a working class,

09:09.057 --> 09:11.459
blue collar contractor,
maybe named Bobby.

09:11.460 --> 09:14.061
You're so cute. No,
it was pretty obvious

09:14.062 --> 09:16.063
to everyone you should
wind up with Candy Andy.

09:16.064 --> 09:18.065
Yeah, I thought so, too.

09:18.066 --> 09:20.401
Candy Andy!

09:20.402 --> 09:22.470
I do not go by that silly name, Max.

09:22.471 --> 09:25.673
It's Candrew Andrew.

09:25.674 --> 09:27.341
- Andrew.
- Hey.

09:27.342 --> 09:29.577
You look great.

09:29.578 --> 09:33.414
Oh, sorry, ooh.

09:33.415 --> 09:36.517
You two are like me and my
eighth grade science teacher.

09:36.518 --> 09:39.620
Just can't keep your
hands off each other.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.922
Max, you ruined Mr. Brillstein's life,

09:41.923 --> 09:44.925
and, like Mr. Brillstein,
Andy is married.

09:44.926 --> 09:46.794
Oh, uh, well, actually I'm divorced.

09:49.331 --> 09:52.833
There's your M. Night Shyamalan twist!

09:52.834 --> 09:55.202
But don't let him direct
the rest of the movie.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.805
Oh, how about a picture of
you two for the photographers?

09:57.806 --> 09:58.873
You look great together.

10:00.342 --> 10:02.209
I'm sorry your marriage didn't work out.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.678
Yeah, me too.

10:03.679 --> 10:06.681
My father-in-law had
box seats to the Rangers.

10:06.682 --> 10:08.315
You look beautiful.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.384
You have my lipstick on your mouth.

10:10.385 --> 10:13.154
Oh, well, maybe we wear the same shade.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.990
That'll be six... ehh, $27.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:26.133 --> 10:28.134
Hey, Earl. Don't get up.

10:28.135 --> 10:29.735
No chance of that, unless they start

10:29.736 --> 10:32.403
making Viagra for the entire body.

10:34.073 --> 10:36.642
Uh, Caroline's not
here. What do you need?

10:36.643 --> 10:38.644
Actually, I wanted to talk to you guys.

10:38.645 --> 10:42.047
Even though she told
me never to do that.

10:42.048 --> 10:46.752
You guys wanna see a nipple
that looks like Fred Flintstone?

10:46.753 --> 10:48.554
Now I see why.

10:48.555 --> 10:51.223
If this is an Amway pitch,
I've fallen for that twice.

10:51.224 --> 10:54.860
Let's just say I am way in debt.

10:54.861 --> 10:56.862
No, it's this... this Andy guy.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.126
What can you tell me about him?

10:58.127 --> 10:59.865
Is he good looking? Rich?

10:59.866 --> 11:02.668
Does he have Amazon
Prime? I'm dying, here.

11:02.669 --> 11:06.038
Oh, I thought you
weren't the jealous type.

11:06.039 --> 11:08.941
But you're sweating like skinny
Jonah Hill trying to be funny

11:08.942 --> 11:12.912
or fat Jonah Hill trying to be serious.

11:12.913 --> 11:14.680
Well, I am the jealous
type. I just wanted

11:14.681 --> 11:16.323
to look cool in front of Caroline.

11:16.324 --> 11:18.348
I don't care what I look
like in front of you guys.

11:18.349 --> 11:19.533
Obviously.

11:20.686 --> 11:23.055
You have nothing to worry about, Andy.

11:23.056 --> 11:25.424
I mean, Bobby.

11:25.425 --> 11:27.092
Much like the copy of TV Guide

11:27.093 --> 11:28.427
Earl is currently reading,

11:28.428 --> 11:30.763
Candy Andy is old news.

11:30.764 --> 11:32.264
Ooh, there's another episode

11:32.265 --> 11:35.868
of Facts of Life tonight, you know?

11:35.869 --> 11:37.302
Hey, everybo...

11:39.205 --> 11:43.142
Wouldn't you like to finish
that sentence for me, Earl?

11:43.143 --> 11:48.480
Since you don't have your own
character in Caroline's movie.

11:48.481 --> 11:49.982
Yeah, you're right.

11:49.983 --> 11:51.450
I got nothing to worry about.

11:51.451 --> 11:52.484
I should get going.

11:52.485 --> 11:54.486
Hey, Andy.

11:54.487 --> 11:56.989
I mean, Bobby.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.425
Look, did you see this picture

11:59.426 --> 12:01.827
of Caroline with Candy Andy?

12:01.828 --> 12:05.231
Look, he's got his arm
around her at a junket.

12:05.232 --> 12:08.300
Is that hand on her
lower back or upper butt?

12:08.301 --> 12:11.770
Hey, man, it's a good thing
you're not the jealous type.

12:11.771 --> 12:16.475
Especially since he has
his hand right on her ass.

12:16.476 --> 12:20.980
Hey... I was gonna say that!

12:20.981 --> 12:25.950
Can you at least give me
one thing of my own, Earl?

12:31.123 --> 12:35.226
♪ I'll be in our booth ♪

12:38.764 --> 12:40.466
I'm from the New York Times.

12:40.467 --> 12:43.469
Ha, what the hell are you doing here?

12:43.470 --> 12:45.471
I have a question for Tess.

12:45.472 --> 12:49.308
In G'day Kate, you married
a kangaroo for a green card?

12:49.309 --> 12:50.976
So this is super weird, right?

12:50.977 --> 12:53.178
Looking at them, being us.

12:53.179 --> 12:55.614
Andy, I can't talk now. I
have to promote my dessert bar

12:55.615 --> 12:57.449
and answer all these questions.

12:57.450 --> 13:01.120
You know how reporters get when
they have a fascinating subject.

13:01.121 --> 13:03.264
Caroline, no one's asked
you anything and they already

13:03.265 --> 13:05.958
told you to stop raising your hand.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.961
Max, the actress playing you isn't here.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.397
It's been reported she's
been on a downward spiral

13:11.398 --> 13:13.198
ever since she got into the role.

13:13.199 --> 13:15.567
Her behavior is disgusting,

13:15.568 --> 13:19.004
and I very much approve.

13:19.005 --> 13:23.542
This is for Michelle, the young
lady playing the Han character.

13:23.543 --> 13:25.210
What drove you to the role?

13:25.211 --> 13:27.513
My mom said I had to start
helping out in this family

13:27.514 --> 13:30.516
if I wanted unlimited data.

13:30.517 --> 13:33.519
And for Janelle, portraying Pearl,

13:33.520 --> 13:35.521
how did you prepare to play a Black man

13:35.522 --> 13:37.222
and a larger-than-life Polish woman?

13:37.223 --> 13:41.894
Two dialogue coaches and a lot of wigs.

13:41.895 --> 13:46.097
And I stopped showering the
minute I got the role of Oleg.

13:49.101 --> 13:51.737
Caroline, I have a
question for you about us.

13:51.738 --> 13:54.573
A Q & A is not the place for questions.

13:54.574 --> 13:55.957
Well, fine, I won't ask you, then.

13:55.958 --> 13:57.209
I'll just tell you.

13:57.210 --> 14:00.412
I miss you and your
adorable crooked smile.

14:00.413 --> 14:02.348
I mean, look at the Hollywood us.

14:02.349 --> 14:04.583
We could be the real version of them.

14:04.584 --> 14:07.720
Just, you know, I
wouldn't wear guyliner.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.522
Caroline, fate brought
us together for a reason.

14:10.523 --> 14:12.224
I mean, we had a really good thing.

14:12.225 --> 14:14.960
I think we should give it another shot.

14:14.961 --> 14:18.629
Caroline Channing, you said
you own a dessert bar now?

14:20.366 --> 14:22.935
Oh... ohh.

14:22.936 --> 14:25.304
Caroline's speechless.

14:25.305 --> 14:27.839
Guess I'm down to two
wishes on that magic lamp.

14:35.685 --> 14:36.619
So what do you think?

14:36.620 --> 14:39.823
I think that girl might be dead.

14:39.824 --> 14:42.896
But what about me and Andy?
I mean, you don't think

14:42.897 --> 14:45.299
it means something that we tested well.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.801
Hey, I test positive
for stuff all the time.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.339
I'm not allowed to donate or get blood,

14:52.340 --> 14:54.273
but other than that, it's cool.

14:56.477 --> 14:59.847
Ugh, Andy and I do look great together.

14:59.848 --> 15:02.883
What if America knows
more about me than I do?

15:02.884 --> 15:06.887
Then I feel worse for
America than I already do.

15:06.888 --> 15:08.471
I-I don't know why any of this matters.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.857
Andy knows you have a boyfriend.

15:09.858 --> 15:13.227
I didn't tell him.

15:13.228 --> 15:15.062
Why didn't I tell him?

15:15.063 --> 15:17.830
And boom goes the Shyamalan.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.835
Hey, Max, they don't have
chocolate milk, I asked.

15:21.836 --> 15:26.807
Ugh! How do they expect
me to wash down my scrimps?

15:26.808 --> 15:28.575
Caroline, can we just
talk and maybe spend

15:28.576 --> 15:29.839
the rest of our lives together?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.346
You know, keep it casual.

15:32.347 --> 15:34.781
Hey! Mr. Candy guy!

15:34.782 --> 15:36.984
Get your hands off my girl!

15:36.985 --> 15:38.252
Ouch!

15:38.253 --> 15:40.721
Dude, you spilled my drink!

15:40.722 --> 15:43.190
She's my girlfriend.

15:43.191 --> 15:44.924
No, she is not. Who are you?

15:47.261 --> 15:50.631
Bobby, you attacked the
wrong Andy in a jealous rage.

15:50.632 --> 15:52.866
He's over here.

15:52.867 --> 15:55.002
Hey, how's it going?
Should I put my drink down?

15:55.003 --> 15:58.539
Ah, no... I've
embarrassed myself enough.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.908
I'm sorry, Caroline.
I just couldn't stand

16:00.909 --> 16:02.709
the thought of you
doing it with another guy

16:02.710 --> 16:05.012
once a week in the beginning.

16:05.013 --> 16:09.116
Bobby, I love that you're
jealous... violently jealous.

16:09.117 --> 16:11.084
But you don't need to be.

16:11.085 --> 16:12.753
- Andy, I have a boyfriend.
- Mm.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.455
A violently jealous boyfriend.

16:15.456 --> 16:17.558
I wouldn't say violently.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.026
I choked you out for a
Pop-Tart this morning.

16:22.496 --> 16:25.065
All right. Super awkward right now.

16:25.066 --> 16:26.595
Um, well, I guess I'm gonna have to go

16:26.596 --> 16:29.169
cancel the Mariachi band
I hired to serenade us.

16:29.170 --> 16:31.171
Adios, $10 deposit.

16:31.172 --> 16:33.373
Ooh, you should bring
them by the dessert bar.

16:33.374 --> 16:35.208
I'm having an after
party there with the cast.

16:35.209 --> 16:36.643
We are?

16:36.644 --> 16:40.379
Mm, well... I guess
now you're invited, too.

16:42.983 --> 16:45.052
And here's something else you can use.

16:45.053 --> 16:49.089
When I rent a car, I
usually go with the Sebring.

16:49.090 --> 16:52.259
I'm starting to see why
they cut most of my scenes.

16:52.260 --> 16:56.029
Once I rented a Tercel. Once.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.364
I gotta take this.

16:57.365 --> 16:59.398
I know it's not ringing, but you get it.

17:00.734 --> 17:02.769
Will the real Han please stand up?

17:02.770 --> 17:04.103
And then leave.

17:09.009 --> 17:13.046
♪ I'll be in my booth ♪

17:13.047 --> 17:16.115
♪ I'll be in my booth ♪

17:18.085 --> 17:22.556
♪ I'll be in my booth ♪

17:22.557 --> 17:27.027
♪ I'll be in my booth ♪

17:27.028 --> 17:28.527
You just don't get it.

17:31.632 --> 17:34.701
Can I mix alcohol and,
like, five red pills?

17:34.702 --> 17:37.136
Ha, would I be standing
here if you couldn't?

17:40.273 --> 17:45.445
Uh, this might seem weird
or maybe just freaky enough,

17:45.446 --> 17:51.151
but I am very attracted to
that part of her that is me.

17:51.152 --> 17:53.453
You know what, Earl? You
play your cards right,

17:53.454 --> 17:56.355
you might be screwing yourself tonight.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.658
What's up, girl?

18:01.161 --> 18:03.130
Did I tell you that I got super rich?

18:03.131 --> 18:04.898
Yeah, got injured at Six Flags.

18:04.899 --> 18:06.366
Not even in a cool way.

18:06.367 --> 18:09.770
Tripped on a fat kid,
landed on a skinny kid.

18:09.771 --> 18:11.371
Maybe you should go for Tess.

18:11.372 --> 18:12.639
I bet she'll be single soon

18:12.640 --> 18:14.241
since Bobby's jealous rage

18:14.242 --> 18:16.043
sent her boyfriend to the hospital.

18:16.044 --> 18:18.045
I did not. I got his autograph.

18:18.046 --> 18:20.947
He voiced a parakeet in Zootopia.

18:20.948 --> 18:23.182
Cacaw. Ring a bell?

18:26.086 --> 18:27.888
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.552
I won't see you at
the premiere next week.

18:29.553 --> 18:31.224
I'm gonna go drown my sorrows in Paris.

18:31.225 --> 18:33.126
And Bali. Well, wherever they have

18:33.127 --> 18:34.928
the most expensive jewels.

18:34.929 --> 18:37.130
Anything?

18:37.131 --> 18:38.632
I'm right here.

18:38.633 --> 18:40.367
Guys, don't fight over me

18:40.368 --> 18:43.437
until I have the
camera open on my phone.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.539
Well, you're a lucky guy, Bobby.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.374
Just... by the way, she
is a really horrible...

18:49.609 --> 18:51.611
No, I can't think of anything.

18:51.612 --> 18:53.212
She's pretty perfect.

18:55.015 --> 18:56.450
I'm sure if you tried really hard

18:56.451 --> 18:57.984
you'll find someone willing to date

18:57.985 --> 19:02.022
a very attractive rich guy
in the prime of his life.

19:02.023 --> 19:03.690
Now you're making me want to date him.

19:03.691 --> 19:05.192
Well, I better get going.

19:05.193 --> 19:07.461
Helicopter traffic gets crazy at 8:00.

19:07.462 --> 19:08.627
Anything?

19:11.164 --> 19:13.400
Helicopter?

19:13.401 --> 19:15.869
Well...

19:15.870 --> 19:17.537
I've been trying to look for Vanessa,

19:17.538 --> 19:20.640
but she probably goes
by her gang name, now.

19:20.641 --> 19:22.242
I couldn't find her
on my police scanner,

19:22.243 --> 19:23.746
but it did help me avoid selling weed

19:23.747 --> 19:24.945
to an undercover cop.

19:26.414 --> 19:27.813
Copy that, Sarge.

19:31.017 --> 19:33.153
All right, Oleg. Let's go.

19:33.154 --> 19:36.156
It's Wednesday, so we
gotta take the garbage out

19:36.157 --> 19:38.091
so we can do it under the sink.

19:38.092 --> 19:39.992
Ooh, plumber style.

19:42.362 --> 19:44.264
Sophie.

19:44.265 --> 19:46.066
That's not me.

19:46.067 --> 19:50.436
But my God, he is gorgeous.

19:52.005 --> 19:53.774
Wow!

19:53.775 --> 19:56.777
I had a dream like this once.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.311
Only I was covered in nougat.

20:01.248 --> 20:03.884
Let's go, one of the Olegs.

20:03.885 --> 20:06.286
All right, bye, Max.

20:06.287 --> 20:08.388
Oh, hi, Max.

20:08.389 --> 20:12.125
Max? Vanessa's here!

20:12.126 --> 20:14.161
Oh, my God. You're gonna be okay.

20:14.162 --> 20:16.429
Just keep drinking. You
tried being me too fast.

20:16.430 --> 20:17.693
- I just...
- Don't talk, drink.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.866
How are you not dead?

20:19.867 --> 20:22.469
Shh.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.471
Did you see that?

20:24.472 --> 20:27.107
She's never patted my head like that.

20:27.108 --> 20:31.044
And she even gave me a birthday
coupon for one free head pat.

20:31.045 --> 20:33.313
Is that jealousy I see?

20:33.314 --> 20:35.549
Max and I are in a strong relationship.

20:35.550 --> 20:38.118
I am not jealous.

20:38.119 --> 20:41.121
Are they in a full-on hug now?
I'm redeeming my coupon.

20:50.598 --> 20:52.332
Anything?

20:52.333 --> 20:54.034
No? Okay, cut it.

20:54.035 --> 20:58.705
Uh, all right, come on.
Who likes helicopter rides?

20:58.706 --> 21:00.372
Helicopter?

21:05.456 --> 21:12.430
