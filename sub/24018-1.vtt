00:24.890 --> 00:26.356
Are you even...

00:26.358 --> 00:28.659
Yeah,
just give me a second.

00:31.129 --> 00:32.662
Okay.
Okay.

00:32.664 --> 00:34.665
- Okay? You want me to...
- Yeah. Just give me a second.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.998
Just give me a second.
Okay.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.199
Okay.

00:37.201 --> 00:39.001
- Oh.
- Ah. There we go.

00:40.706 --> 00:43.674
I love you.

00:43.676 --> 00:46.677
You're so perfect.
I love you.

00:46.679 --> 00:48.345
Just stay like this.
Just...

00:48.347 --> 00:50.312
Just stay like this forever.

00:50.314 --> 00:52.315
Okay.

00:52.317 --> 00:55.351
I love you.

00:55.353 --> 00:57.354
Oh. Careful.
Careful.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.361
- See, I told you.
- It was quick.

01:06.364 --> 01:07.363
Congratulations.

01:07.365 --> 01:08.964
Thank you.
Is that a record?

01:10.168 --> 01:12.335
I don't want to get
anything on the sheets.

01:14.338 --> 01:16.773
Will you get me
something?

01:16.775 --> 01:18.475
Phew.
Towel.

01:18.477 --> 01:21.110
Thank you.

01:21.112 --> 01:24.814
- There we go.
- Phew.

01:24.816 --> 01:27.116
Ooh.

01:27.118 --> 01:28.885
Mm.

01:28.887 --> 01:30.386
- Where's the remote?
- Hmm?

01:30.388 --> 01:31.421
You have the remote?

01:31.423 --> 01:32.922
No, I thought you had it.

01:32.924 --> 01:33.556
Oh, yeah.

01:33.558 --> 01:35.758
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:37.495 --> 01:39.228
I love you.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.097
I love you.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.732
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:10.829 --> 02:14.064
All right, class, I'm
looking forward to your thesis drafts.

02:14.066 --> 02:18.535
But first, Anna...
30 is a milestone.

02:18.537 --> 02:20.269
Say goodbye to your youth.

02:20.271 --> 02:21.537
Great.

02:21.539 --> 02:22.939
- Surprise, Anna.
- Surprise!

02:22.941 --> 02:24.441
- Happy birthday, Anna.
- Thanks.

02:24.443 --> 02:26.175
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

02:26.177 --> 02:29.946
Anna, you are the most
beautiful thing I...

02:29.948 --> 02:33.250
I have ever seen... No.

02:33.252 --> 02:35.552
Anna, I...

02:35.554 --> 02:38.255
want to be with you
for the rest of my life,

02:38.257 --> 02:41.358
and I hope you do, too?

02:41.360 --> 02:42.491
No. No.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.227
No, no, no, no.
Pbht!

02:48.066 --> 02:49.833
- Hey.
- Hello.

02:49.835 --> 02:51.268
Happy birthday!

02:51.270 --> 02:53.370
Mm!

02:53.372 --> 02:54.404
- Don't panic.
- What?

02:54.406 --> 02:56.239
- Oh.
- 30's just the beginning...

02:56.241 --> 02:57.473
of the end of your life.

02:57.475 --> 02:58.975
Ooh!
Oh, it's big.

02:58.977 --> 03:00.209
I cannot wait
till you see this.

03:00.211 --> 03:01.746
Yes.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.348
Oh, that is scary.

03:07.819 --> 03:09.953
Look at that hair!
Look at you.

03:09.955 --> 03:11.453
- You look so handsome.
- Whose arm is that?

03:11.455 --> 03:13.823
Thought you could probably use
some art for the new house.

03:13.825 --> 03:14.958
New house?
Somebody say new house?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.525
- Huh? Huh?
- Hey, we're right on schedule.

03:16.527 --> 03:17.727
Okay. Okay.

03:17.729 --> 03:19.529
All right, we're nowhere
near on schedule...

03:19.531 --> 03:21.530
- Thank you.
- ...but listen, I screwed up,

03:21.532 --> 03:25.935
made a few crucial
miscalculations, you know.

03:25.937 --> 03:26.804
Just not this one.

03:26.806 --> 03:27.671
Aww.

03:27.673 --> 03:28.739
- That was nice.
- Thank you.

03:28.741 --> 03:29.705
- It was good.
- It was good, right?

03:29.707 --> 03:31.642
- Good save.
- It was good, right?

03:31.644 --> 03:33.375
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.

03:33.377 --> 03:35.911
You know what I was thinking
about coming here tonight?

03:35.913 --> 03:37.179
Summers at the lake.

03:37.181 --> 03:38.381
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:38.383 --> 03:40.883
Like how our parents
left us up there, you know?

03:40.885 --> 03:42.518
I mean, they should be here
tonight, Mom and Dad.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.989
Hey, look, they are who
they are, and we love them.

03:45.991 --> 03:49.993
It just reminded me that you
covered for them, so thank you.

03:49.995 --> 03:52.294
- Oh, my God, and we'd gossip about boys...
- Yeah.

03:52.296 --> 03:53.864
...and your crush on Teddy.

03:53.866 --> 03:54.798
- For Will.
- No, Teddy.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.399
Ted... for Will.

03:56.401 --> 03:58.133
Sorry.
Teddy Fredricks?

03:58.135 --> 03:59.234
Teddy Fredricks.

03:59.236 --> 04:00.769
- You remember him.
- With the giant neck?

04:00.771 --> 04:02.005
- No, he did not have a giant neck.
- This guy had a giant neck.

04:02.007 --> 04:03.739
- It was huge, Reece.
- He was just very strong.

04:03.741 --> 04:04.806
He was like an orc.

04:04.808 --> 04:06.142
You knew I had
a crush on Teddy.

04:06.144 --> 04:07.209
No, I did not.

04:07.211 --> 04:09.546
My point is
we were inseparable.

04:09.548 --> 04:11.314
God, you guys met
when you were babies.

04:11.316 --> 04:13.215
We were babies!

04:13.217 --> 04:15.251
First loves
and still together.

04:15.253 --> 04:17.286
Never been with anybody else
your entire lives.

04:17.288 --> 04:18.622
It's so crazy.

04:18.624 --> 04:20.190
- And it killed me because I thought...
- Come on.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.959
- ..."I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life."
- All right.

04:23.961 --> 04:26.529
But then
you introduced me to him.

04:26.531 --> 04:29.365
Now, if you could just convince
this one to knock me up,

04:29.367 --> 04:30.533
that would be lovely.

04:31.668 --> 04:34.070
- They should be here tonight.
- William.

04:34.072 --> 04:36.072
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not trying

04:36.074 --> 04:37.339
to call you out
in front of your someday wife,

04:37.341 --> 04:40.243
but when we were
in the dorms freshman year,

04:40.245 --> 04:43.012
you told me you'd
already amassed

04:43.014 --> 04:44.313
quite a few notches
on your belt.

04:44.315 --> 04:46.483
Really?
Is that right? You did?

04:46.485 --> 04:48.183
I-I lied.

04:48.185 --> 04:49.118
Wow.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.420
- It's a weird lie.
- Reece.

04:50.422 --> 04:52.522
- I was 18.
- We shared a bunk. We had a bond.

04:52.524 --> 04:53.690
- Come on.
- It wasn't enough to...

04:53.692 --> 04:56.192
No, it's just I was
a quiet farm boy,

04:56.194 --> 04:58.327
and you were so fucking cool
and impressive.

04:58.329 --> 05:00.296
- I wasn't enough.
- No, it's not that. No.

05:00.298 --> 05:03.033
It's just he had a tattoo,
he had all the best drugs,

05:03.035 --> 05:04.935
he'd already fucked
so many...

05:04.937 --> 05:06.303
you'd already fucked
two Congressmen.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.038
Together, as well as separately.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.673
- I'm a uniter.
- Oh, okay.

05:09.675 --> 05:11.574
I wanted you to like me,
so I lied.

05:11.576 --> 05:12.942
Well, it's disappointing.

05:12.944 --> 05:14.411
We've made up for it
since.

05:14.413 --> 05:15.478
- Only with her.
- What?

05:15.480 --> 05:16.947
You know what, Reece?

05:16.949 --> 05:22.685
Our sex life, we don't need to
because our sex life is...

05:22.687 --> 05:24.353
is really, really great.

05:24.355 --> 05:26.356
Compared to what?

05:26.358 --> 05:27.757
Reece.

05:27.759 --> 05:29.959
I mean, Anna, if you've never
had anybody but Will,

05:29.961 --> 05:33.062
I say find out what
another cock feels like.

05:33.064 --> 05:34.331
- What?
- Reece.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.265
Don't you want to know?
Aren't you curious?

05:36.267 --> 05:38.233
You must be.
I mean, really, come on.

05:38.235 --> 05:40.070
The two of you
are so perfect

05:40.072 --> 05:42.005
and constant and inevitable
and fucking boring.

05:42.007 --> 05:43.639
You practically
already have babies.

05:43.641 --> 05:45.108
- Live a little!
- Okay, come on.

05:45.110 --> 05:46.209
Don't you want to be the guy
you pretended to be in college?

05:46.211 --> 05:48.344
Aren't you gonna be
a little disappointed

05:48.346 --> 05:50.714
if you die
and you never were?

05:50.716 --> 05:51.682
Anyway, look,
there's no risk.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.449
You two...
You two love each other.

05:53.451 --> 05:54.750
You love each other.

05:54.752 --> 05:56.652
You're a monument to love
that will stand for all time

05:56.654 --> 05:57.753
and I toast you
and I love you.

05:57.755 --> 05:59.488
- Oh, cheers, Reece.
- Thank you very much.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.326
Thank you so much.

06:03.394 --> 06:05.461
Well...

06:05.463 --> 06:07.430
Um...

06:07.432 --> 06:11.166
Following that,
I was...

06:11.168 --> 06:17.272
Uh, I was going to...

06:17.274 --> 06:20.075
give you a set of keys
tonight.

06:20.077 --> 06:22.512
But the house
isn't finished,

06:22.514 --> 06:25.014
so no keys, sorry.

06:25.016 --> 06:29.618
Um, but I-I will say,
um...

06:29.620 --> 06:33.192
Anna...

06:36.261 --> 06:39.628
I could look at your face
for the rest of my life,

06:39.630 --> 06:43.268
and, um...

06:45.569 --> 06:48.139
I love you.

06:50.274 --> 06:52.477
I-I love you.

06:54.346 --> 06:56.447
Happy birthday.

07:06.223 --> 07:07.723
You liked Teddy Fredricks.

07:07.725 --> 07:09.558
Yeah, before you came along.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.228
Did you journal about him
and his thick neck?

07:12.230 --> 07:15.264
Yeah, I was scared,
but he... he wanted me.

07:15.266 --> 07:17.199
Oh, how Victorian.

07:17.201 --> 07:19.101
Wait, this is after
we were together?

07:19.103 --> 07:20.736
Yeah, it was kind of a standing
offer until college.

07:20.738 --> 07:22.572
- Really?
- Sure.

07:22.574 --> 07:24.406
And?

07:24.408 --> 07:27.577
Uh, we moved to Naples
and got married.

07:27.579 --> 07:30.149
I-I chose you.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.348
- But you were into Teddy.
- That is...

07:33.350 --> 07:36.118
What? I was curious.
I mean it's not...

07:36.120 --> 07:38.221
You... You've been attracted
to other women.

07:38.223 --> 07:40.656
I mean...
Yeah, not...

07:40.658 --> 07:42.759
- Well...
- Well, no, not more than you.

07:42.761 --> 07:45.127
No.

07:45.129 --> 07:46.628
Okay.
Points for that.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.764
Mm.
Thank you.

07:48.766 --> 07:52.368
I suppose,
you know, you just...

07:52.370 --> 07:56.572
I w-wanted experience.

07:56.574 --> 07:59.709
And I got in the way.

07:59.711 --> 08:01.777
Obviously not.

08:09.553 --> 08:11.553
You're a real tit
sometimes, you know that?

08:11.555 --> 08:14.123
Whatever.
I shouldn't drink champagne.

08:15.759 --> 08:17.493
Yeah,
I think you just think

08:17.495 --> 08:20.163
you're way funnier
than you actually are.

08:20.165 --> 08:21.197
- Nonsense.
- No.

08:21.199 --> 08:22.464
- I'm very funny.
- Oh, yeah, you are?

08:22.466 --> 08:26.202
- Mm.
- I think we can agree to disagree on that one.

08:26.204 --> 08:28.738
You'd be lost without me.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.473
Hey.

08:30.475 --> 08:31.541
- Hmm.
- Hey.

08:31.543 --> 08:34.376
- What?
- Mm.

08:34.379 --> 08:37.147
I meant what I said
earlier.

08:37.149 --> 08:40.249
About what?

08:40.251 --> 08:43.184
About having a baby.
I want to have a baby.

08:43.187 --> 08:45.754
- How about a puppy?
- Come on.

08:45.756 --> 08:47.323
Mwah.

08:47.325 --> 08:49.191
Can we have the bill,
please?

08:49.193 --> 08:50.926
Reece,
that's not a waitress.

08:50.928 --> 08:52.127
Oh, fuck.

08:55.366 --> 08:57.367
Ow! Careful!

08:59.870 --> 09:01.170
I wouldn't be jealous.
Would you?

09:01.172 --> 09:04.806
W-Were you thinking about...
about this the whole time?

09:04.808 --> 09:06.041
- No.
- About... About...

09:06.043 --> 09:08.177
- No, I just...
- ...my crush on Teddy Fredricks?

09:08.179 --> 09:10.445
No, I'm just curious.
I was just curious.

09:10.447 --> 09:12.315
- What do you mean?
- Hmm?

09:12.317 --> 09:13.815
What do you mean
you're curious?

09:13.817 --> 09:15.618
- Yeah.
- Are you asking asking?

09:15.620 --> 09:17.653
Hmm?

09:17.655 --> 09:20.190
I don't know.
No, I...

09:20.192 --> 09:22.358
I'm just...
Maybe.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.427
I'm just...
I don't...

09:41.779 --> 09:43.313
Why'd you say
that shit last night?

09:43.315 --> 09:45.248
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.650
It was fucking stupid.
I was very drunk. I'm sorry.

09:47.652 --> 09:48.984
Sorry about Reece last night.
He had a...

09:48.986 --> 09:50.686
- Oh, whatever.
- Yeah.

09:50.688 --> 09:52.488
He had a lot to drink
before we went out.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.290
- No. Really?
- Yeah, he did.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.757
How many guys were you
with before Hale?

09:55.759 --> 09:57.292
I have no idea.

09:57.294 --> 09:59.362
Well, like, a number.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.898
More than you, considerably
less than a thousand.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.968
- And Hale was the best?
- No.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.402
Anderson Cooper...
avarice bottom.

10:07.404 --> 10:10.406
It doesn't bother me.
I know he was joking.

10:10.408 --> 10:11.873
You never think about
being with anyone else?

10:11.875 --> 10:14.444
No, not really.
Not seriously, no.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.278
I mean, with Hale,
it's comfortable.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.815
There's common cause.
That's everything.

10:18.817 --> 10:22.721
It's not like I feel like
I'm missing out or whatever.

10:23.687 --> 10:25.754
Shotgun in your mouth,
if you live till you're 90,

10:25.756 --> 10:28.526
Hale is the last person
you'll ever fuck?

10:30.427 --> 10:31.526
Yeah.

10:31.528 --> 10:33.664
Gun in my mouth,
I say absolutely.

10:37.936 --> 10:39.301
Ow.
Ooh.

10:39.303 --> 10:41.371
- Yep. Yeah.
- Ooh.

10:41.373 --> 10:42.738
There's
a little more to go.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.877
There you go.
Good job.

10:53.717 --> 10:59.555
You think it's, like,
fate, what we have?

10:59.557 --> 11:02.758
Hmm?
What?

11:02.760 --> 11:04.826
Nothing.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.983
How's the sushi?

11:27.985 --> 11:30.887
Am I holding you back?

11:30.889 --> 11:32.522
What?

11:32.524 --> 11:34.791
Do I...

11:34.793 --> 11:38.026
Are you satis...
satisfied w-with... with me?

11:38.028 --> 11:41.330
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

11:43.868 --> 11:45.767
Look, you have one life,

11:45.769 --> 11:50.940
and I would never, never,
never want to stop you

11:50.942 --> 11:55.744
from doing something
if, when.

11:55.746 --> 11:58.647
Theoretically,
it would be okay, I think.

11:58.649 --> 12:01.416
It would be...
I think <i>I</i> would be okay.

12:01.418 --> 12:03.353
Can you say what you mean?

12:06.390 --> 12:10.629
I think that you should
sleep with other women.

12:15.633 --> 12:16.932
I mean, just if we're...
if we're

12:16.934 --> 12:19.001
gonna be together
forever...

12:19.003 --> 12:20.435
You think I want to?

12:20.437 --> 12:21.704
Look.

12:21.706 --> 12:24.540
I know how much you love me
and always will,

12:24.542 --> 12:28.677
so why shouldn't you,
right?

12:28.679 --> 12:30.445
I mean, if I love you
as much as I do,

12:30.447 --> 12:32.448
then I shouldn't
be threatened by that.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.685
- I couldn't be. I mean, I know it's just...
- Do <i>you</i> want to?

12:37.688 --> 12:39.690
I don't know.

12:46.464 --> 12:47.729
- Monogamy is stupid, okay?
- Uh-huh.

12:47.731 --> 12:49.665
That is... That is the part
of what you said

12:49.667 --> 12:51.066
- that makes sense, okay?
- Right.

12:51.068 --> 12:52.267
Not that I... I mean, no,
but you...

12:52.269 --> 12:53.236
You're... You're right.

12:53.238 --> 12:56.071
- It's... It's bad design.
- Sure.

12:56.073 --> 12:57.306
At least,
it defies all logic.

12:57.308 --> 12:58.675
It's just... It's just crazy
that w-we've never

12:58.677 --> 12:59.975
- talked about this, that's all, you know?
- Right.

12:59.977 --> 13:02.578
I mean, we just did
what we were supposed to.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.079
- Yeah, 'cause we were so youn.
- Right. How did we know?

13:04.081 --> 13:07.883
I don't want you to want me
because you have to, you know?

13:07.885 --> 13:10.420
I want you to want me
because you <i>want</i> to,

13:10.422 --> 13:12.722
not because
I-I own your body.

13:12.724 --> 13:15.757
Well, you can own
a little bit of it.

13:15.759 --> 13:17.560
You think I want
to own a little bit of it?

13:37.649 --> 13:39.614
Okay, so, look.
Last night, that was weird.

13:39.616 --> 13:41.883
Yeah.
Are we gonna try it?

13:41.885 --> 13:44.987
Okay, if we were gonna
do it, what we...

13:44.989 --> 13:47.956
what would
we even call it?

13:47.958 --> 13:49.224
An open relationship?

13:49.226 --> 13:50.593
No.
The relationship's not open.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.627
- No. No.
- The relationship's just you and me.

13:52.629 --> 13:53.628
Right.
That's what I meant.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.131
You can just fuck
other people.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.967
Ah.

13:57.969 --> 14:02.341
As could you,
obviously.

14:04.775 --> 14:06.975
I don't think
it's gonna work.

14:06.977 --> 14:08.511
Well, why not?

14:08.513 --> 14:10.546
Uh, human nature,

14:10.548 --> 14:12.982
thousands of cautionary tales
preceding you.

14:12.984 --> 14:14.584
That's not us.

14:14.586 --> 14:15.752
How come this
has never come up before?

14:15.754 --> 14:17.652
Been with each other
for, like, a billion years

14:17.654 --> 14:19.522
and never thought about
fucking someone else?

14:19.524 --> 14:21.156
Well, no, of course
I've thought about it.

14:21.158 --> 14:22.358
I've been attracted
to other people.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.594
God, you've only been with,
like, one person

14:24.596 --> 14:26.228
your entire life.

14:26.230 --> 14:29.931
Ugh! It's biblical.
It's Shari'a.

14:29.933 --> 14:31.032
Fidelity has value.

14:31.034 --> 14:32.368
It's why it's such
a common measure

14:32.370 --> 14:34.970
for evaluating a relationship.

14:34.972 --> 14:37.105
I get that you want
to evolve beyond jealousy.

14:37.107 --> 14:38.206
I don't think it's possible.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.877
You want to be with Reece
forever.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.945
Is that a question?

14:42.947 --> 14:44.180
Do you?

14:44.182 --> 14:45.113
No.

14:45.115 --> 14:46.248
I would like
to be with Reece

14:46.250 --> 14:49.185
for as long as we make
each other happy.

14:49.187 --> 14:52.854
But yes, given that,
forever is ideal.

14:52.856 --> 14:54.790
You remember
Shannon and Jeremy, right?

14:54.792 --> 14:57.826
They had, like,
an open relationship.

14:57.828 --> 14:58.861
Yeah, in college.

14:58.863 --> 14:59.962
Yeah, and they're still
together.

14:59.964 --> 15:02.064
They have kids now
and everything.

15:02.066 --> 15:03.434
Doesn't count.

15:04.499 --> 15:06.404
- You're still attracted to Will, right?
- Yeah, of course.

15:07.871 --> 15:10.071
- Anna?
- Yes.

15:10.073 --> 15:11.073
And the sex
is still good?

15:11.075 --> 15:13.276
Yes.

15:13.278 --> 15:16.212
I mean... I think.

15:16.214 --> 15:17.546
You think.

15:17.548 --> 15:18.882
You are saying

15:18.884 --> 15:20.016
that with all the years
you've spent with Hale,

15:20.018 --> 15:21.084
everything you...
you have together,

15:21.086 --> 15:23.886
the love,
the trust between you,

15:23.888 --> 15:26.689
the intimacy,
shared belongings,

15:26.691 --> 15:28.723
your life, everything,
is so fragile

15:28.725 --> 15:31.227
that if he were to sleep
with someone just once,

15:31.229 --> 15:33.728
it would erase
everything you've built?

15:33.730 --> 15:36.565
- Yes.
- That's ludi... That is ludicrous.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.568
Why is it such a threat?

15:38.570 --> 15:40.835
'Cause he's mine.

15:40.837 --> 15:44.574
You sound like a child.
That is a child's answer.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.576
William,
I love you dearly.

15:47.578 --> 15:50.848
This is very stupid.
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:57.822 --> 15:59.591
Go get him.

16:01.926 --> 16:05.261
- What's his name?
- Oh, it's Bowzer.

16:05.263 --> 16:08.030
He's a little rowdy,
but he's a good boy.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.665
I meant, um...

16:09.667 --> 16:12.267
Oh. Yeah, Aidan.

16:12.269 --> 16:14.737
- He's darling.
- Thank you.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.372
This is actually
the only place he sleeps,

16:16.374 --> 16:18.007
but Bowzer likes it,
too.

16:18.009 --> 16:19.108
Mm.

16:19.110 --> 16:20.343
You got any kids?

16:20.345 --> 16:22.744
Uh, no.
No.

16:22.746 --> 16:25.080
Uh, too busy.
I run a garden center.

16:25.082 --> 16:26.114
- Oh.
- Plants.

16:26.116 --> 16:27.248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.618
It's like having
a bunch of kids, right?

16:29.620 --> 16:30.652
Yeah, yeah.

16:30.654 --> 16:32.287
Yeah, well,
your dog's like a kid.

16:32.289 --> 16:34.156
Axel, yeah,
he's my sister's.

16:34.158 --> 16:35.291
Oh.

16:35.293 --> 16:37.158
I'm Hale.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.094
- Hi. Glenn.
- Hey.

16:40.298 --> 16:43.898
Shit.
Again?

16:43.900 --> 16:46.401
Third time this year.
I hate this machine.

16:48.840 --> 16:52.076
Hi, there. Let me know
if you have any questions.

16:55.679 --> 16:58.180
It's incredible.
The smell.

16:58.182 --> 17:03.084
Oh, that? That's cedar.
He's, uh... He's sanding.

17:03.086 --> 17:04.886
Well, I can smell it
all the way down the block.

17:04.887 --> 17:05.954
Oh, really?

17:05.957 --> 17:07.823
I have an exceptional nose,
though.

17:07.825 --> 17:09.659
Oh.
Looks like it.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.192
That's a...
It's a great nose.

17:13.664 --> 17:15.730
Did you make this,
this table?

17:15.732 --> 17:17.199
Yeah, the two of us
make everything

17:17.201 --> 17:20.201
right here
in this store.

17:20.203 --> 17:21.970
Pretty impressive.

17:21.972 --> 17:23.772
Thank you.

17:23.775 --> 17:25.207
Is that your boyfriend?

17:25.209 --> 17:26.374
That?
No, that's my... my partner.

17:26.376 --> 17:29.444
My... My business pa...
He's my best friend.

17:29.446 --> 17:31.113
That's very cool.

17:33.684 --> 17:36.084
Very, very beautiful.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.993
Wait.
Uh...

17:44.461 --> 17:46.228
Want to take
a piece of this?

17:46.230 --> 17:47.962
You know, you can burn it

17:47.964 --> 17:50.999
like... like incense
if you need a fix.

17:52.236 --> 17:53.768
That's very sweet.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.304
Thank you.

17:55.306 --> 17:58.207
- All right.
- I'll do that.

17:58.209 --> 17:59.374
I'll see you around.

17:59.376 --> 18:00.709
Enjoy.

18:00.711 --> 18:02.311
Thank you.
You too.

18:02.313 --> 18:03.978
Bye.

18:07.818 --> 18:09.117
I loved that.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.719
Of course.

18:10.721 --> 18:12.888
What?
It was great!

18:12.890 --> 18:14.724
There was so much talking.

18:14.726 --> 18:15.792
I cried twice.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.259
I know.
You're so emotional.

18:18.261 --> 18:21.131
Whatever.
You love me.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.468
Yeah, well...

18:25.470 --> 18:27.769
- Want to go out?
- Hmm?

18:27.771 --> 18:29.805
- Let's go out. Come on. Come on.
- It's late.

18:29.807 --> 18:31.873
- Let's go out. Let's go dancing.
- It's late.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.142
Let's go dancing.
It's not that late.

18:34.144 --> 18:35.510
- Let's go dancing.
- I've got orders...

18:35.512 --> 18:36.612
- We're not old.
- ...to fill for tomorrow morning.

18:36.614 --> 18:37.779
We're young and beautiful.
Let's dance.

18:37.781 --> 18:41.083
I've got work to do!
Let's go dancing Tuesday.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.952
Fuck Tuesday.

18:43.954 --> 18:45.220
- All right.
- Okay?

18:45.222 --> 18:46.354
- Tuesday.
- Okay. Good.

18:46.356 --> 18:47.355
Can't believe
you didn't like the movie.

18:47.357 --> 18:51.695
Well,
I do have questionable taste.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.668
Hey, get back here.

19:02.773 --> 19:04.440
What are you...
I thought we were going.

19:04.442 --> 19:07.077
What's the rush?

19:09.146 --> 19:10.513
Hmm?

19:10.515 --> 19:11.748
I don't know.

19:14.786 --> 19:18.053
You sure you're ready
for this?

19:18.055 --> 19:19.755
Yeah.
You?

19:55.826 --> 19:58.059
What?
Do you see anyone?

19:58.061 --> 20:00.094
No. Don't be...
Don't be so obvious, okay?

20:00.096 --> 20:01.462
Okay.
Sorry.

20:01.464 --> 20:03.599
- You look great, though.
- Yeah?

20:03.601 --> 20:05.534
- Yeah, fantastic.
- Yeah, so do you.

20:05.536 --> 20:07.169
Thank you.

20:07.171 --> 20:12.106
Uh, you want to
go take a lap, explore?

20:12.108 --> 20:13.208
- Sure.
- Yep.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.977
I'll go this way,
you go that way?

20:14.979 --> 20:16.144
- Okay.
- All right.

20:16.146 --> 20:17.979
Careful.

20:17.981 --> 20:20.382
I'm so sorry.
Let me get that.

20:20.384 --> 20:22.317
Shit.
I'm sorry.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.459
Thanks.
Uh, I'm gonna take a break.

20:31.461 --> 20:32.995
Hey.

20:32.997 --> 20:34.930
H-Hi.

20:34.932 --> 20:36.398
I like
what you're wearing.

20:37.868 --> 20:39.267
- Oh.
- What do you do?

20:39.269 --> 20:44.539
What... What do I...
I... You know...

20:46.243 --> 20:47.910
- You live close by or...
- Hey, babe.

20:47.912 --> 20:50.379
- Well, no.
- They were out of Stella.

20:50.381 --> 20:55.284
Hey.
I'm, uh, the fiancé.

20:55.286 --> 20:58.086
So, uh, you are...?

20:58.088 --> 20:59.354
Ian.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.524
Nice chatting with you.

21:07.597 --> 21:10.032
Yeah.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.400
- Sorry to...
- Thank you.

21:11.402 --> 21:12.500
...break up the fun.

21:12.502 --> 21:14.603
No, no, no. Thank you.
That was, uh...

21:14.605 --> 21:16.138
- He was... He was, uh...
- Yeah.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.673
- It was awkward.
- Yeah, I saw the look on your face and...

21:18.675 --> 21:19.741
Fiancé?

21:19.743 --> 21:20.910
What, a little...
little strong?

21:20.912 --> 21:24.013
Well, maybe. That's a...
That's a big move.

21:24.015 --> 21:25.381
Yeah, I'll admit,

21:25.383 --> 21:28.116
I might be pushing our
fake relationship too fast.

21:28.118 --> 21:30.486
Well, yeah, you might.
I haven't even met you, so...

21:30.488 --> 21:32.287
Vicious technicality.

21:32.289 --> 21:34.456
Wait. Are you... Are you
afraid of fake commitment?

21:34.458 --> 21:37.191
Yeah, I'm terrified.

21:37.193 --> 21:40.261
All this time, you think
you know someone, and...

21:40.263 --> 21:43.231
Yeah.

21:43.233 --> 21:45.467
Beer?

21:45.469 --> 21:46.668
Yes,
I will take a beer.

22:00.284 --> 22:03.151
It's on the, uh,
history of female composers.

22:03.153 --> 22:05.621
Well, then, to finishing
your thesis.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.957
And you to finishing
your, uh...

22:07.959 --> 22:09.357
I don't know, laundry?

22:09.359 --> 22:11.059
I'm Dane.

22:11.061 --> 22:13.261
Oh, yeah.
Hi. I'm... I'm Anna.

22:13.263 --> 22:16.632
Oh. You dickhead.

22:16.634 --> 22:18.667
- What? You love this song?
- I do.

22:18.669 --> 22:21.402
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:24.075 --> 22:26.174
Oh, I'm so... I'm sorry.
I'm such an idiot.

22:26.176 --> 22:28.110
Sorry. This...
This...

22:28.112 --> 22:30.312
is my friend, Will.

22:30.314 --> 22:31.546
Hey.
Dane.

22:31.548 --> 22:34.016
Dane?
Dane?

22:34.018 --> 22:35.517
Dane.
Great name.

22:35.519 --> 22:37.686
Thanks.

22:37.688 --> 22:40.355
It's crazy... I lost
my virginity to this record.

22:40.357 --> 22:41.690
- No way. So did I.
- You did? That's so weird.

22:41.692 --> 22:43.992
So did... So did...
So did she.

22:43.994 --> 22:47.395
Crazy, huh?
How do you guys know each other?

22:47.397 --> 22:49.631
We went to school together.

22:49.633 --> 22:52.534
- Mm-hmm.
- Way back when.

22:52.536 --> 22:56.438
Shit.
I love this song.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.106
You dance?

22:58.108 --> 22:59.074
- Yes.
- We should dance.

22:59.076 --> 23:00.575
- Will.
- All right. Come on.

23:00.577 --> 23:02.443
Come on.
We can dance. Let's dance.

23:02.445 --> 23:03.644
Will!

23:29.339 --> 23:32.207
Oh, shit, my jacket.
I'll be right back.

23:32.209 --> 23:34.045
Oh, okay.

23:38.415 --> 23:40.048
You ready?

23:40.050 --> 23:41.717
For what?

23:41.719 --> 23:43.384
To go home.

23:43.386 --> 23:45.821
You don't want to.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.625
You like him,
he likes you.

23:50.627 --> 23:52.795
So...

23:52.797 --> 23:56.331
Well... what...
what about you?

23:56.333 --> 23:59.767
Well, I'll go home.
He's pretty cool, right?

23:59.769 --> 24:04.605
You are into him,
clearly, so...

24:04.607 --> 24:07.142
You know,
he's a great dancer.

24:07.144 --> 24:12.480
Well, maybe I'll just
take his number or...

24:13.784 --> 24:17.719
Our work here is done, guys.
We changed the whole vibe.

24:17.721 --> 24:19.488
Hipster assholes
are dancing.

24:19.490 --> 24:21.489
You guys got one more in you?

24:21.491 --> 24:24.258
Yeah, I don't have
such an early morning.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.459
Great.

24:25.461 --> 24:27.528
You know, I might...
I might take off. Uh...

24:27.530 --> 24:31.100
You know, you guys...
you guys go have fun.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.834
All right?

24:32.836 --> 24:35.237
All right.

24:35.239 --> 24:38.306
Okay. Are you...
Are you sure?

24:38.308 --> 24:40.275
Yeah.

24:40.277 --> 24:42.510
I'll, uh,
I'll see you, Anna.

24:46.584 --> 24:47.649
Dane.

24:47.651 --> 24:50.585
I'll get her home safe.

24:50.587 --> 24:51.719
Shall we?

24:51.721 --> 24:52.888
Yeah.

25:35.566 --> 25:37.699
Oh.

25:37.701 --> 25:39.934
Wow.

25:39.936 --> 25:42.203
This is cool.

25:42.205 --> 25:43.505
What can I get you?

25:43.507 --> 25:48.112
I'll... I'll take a...
whatever you're having.

25:57.488 --> 25:59.657
Huh.

26:01.558 --> 26:03.461
This is it.

26:05.796 --> 26:07.796
What's, uh...
What's this?

26:07.798 --> 26:11.365
Uh, that was, uh...
That was a long time ago.

26:11.367 --> 26:13.468
- It's yours?
- My old band.

26:13.470 --> 26:16.205
You remember that song
"Drops of Jupiter?"

26:16.207 --> 26:18.774
Uh, y-yeah.
Yeah.

26:18.776 --> 26:21.876
Yeah, they, uh, they knocked us
off the charts, so, um...

26:21.878 --> 26:23.680
Oh.

26:29.220 --> 26:33.555
So, um...
now you...

26:33.557 --> 26:37.361
do something with...
computers?

26:38.729 --> 26:41.566
Do you really care?

26:44.768 --> 26:48.239
No.
Not really.

27:57.074 --> 27:58.073
- Oh, wait.
- What?

27:58.075 --> 28:02.076
Uh, I just, uh...
I just, uh, um...

28:02.078 --> 28:04.746
Can I just use
the bathroom?

28:04.748 --> 28:07.748
Yeah, it's, uh...
You're almost there.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.418
Okay.

28:11.821 --> 28:14.722
<i>Demolition
of 87 London Terrace</i>

28:14.724 --> 28:16.290
<i>was completed on schedule...</i>

28:16.292 --> 28:18.526
<i>...despite the protest
of many local residents</i>

28:18.528 --> 28:21.028
<i>and preservationists.</i>

28:21.030 --> 28:23.600
<i>14 tons of dynamite
were detonated.</i>

28:47.490 --> 28:50.092
Everything all right?

28:50.094 --> 28:52.893
Uh-huh.

28:52.895 --> 28:56.364
Just, um...

28:56.366 --> 28:59.934
one foot
in front of the other.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.123
You don't
have to rush out.

29:21.125 --> 29:24.392
- Um... yeah, I...
- No, really.

29:49.886 --> 29:53.087
Uh...

29:53.089 --> 29:56.525
Y-Yeah, I, um...

29:56.527 --> 30:00.728
- I have s-school tomorrow, so...
- Ah.

30:00.730 --> 30:06.000
And, uh, what's that like?
Your tomorrow?

30:06.002 --> 30:08.836
Uh...

30:08.838 --> 30:11.509
I s-should go.

30:13.943 --> 30:15.209
Uh, I didn't mean...

30:15.211 --> 30:21.585
Oh, no, no. I wasn't say...
T-That was, um...

30:23.153 --> 30:26.153
I just...
I should go.

30:29.859 --> 30:32.026
I'll be staring at my phone
until you call,

30:32.028 --> 30:35.333
but no pressure.

30:48.979 --> 30:52.013
I-I should...
I should go.

30:52.015 --> 30:54.248
Yeah.

31:21.912 --> 31:24.078
Hey.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.516
You okay?

31:28.919 --> 31:32.821
Yeah.
Yeah.

31:32.823 --> 31:34.788
You?

31:34.790 --> 31:36.659
I'm good.

31:45.301 --> 31:46.836
How was it?

31:48.005 --> 31:51.072
Hmm.

31:51.074 --> 31:55.309
It was, um... fun.

31:55.311 --> 31:57.746
It was...

31:57.748 --> 31:59.814
Is that okay
for me to say?

31:59.816 --> 32:01.549
Yeah, yeah.

32:01.551 --> 32:03.820
It was really fun.

32:07.057 --> 32:08.789
Well, good.
Good.

32:08.791 --> 32:11.692
That's...
That's so good.

32:11.694 --> 32:14.296
That's...

32:14.298 --> 32:16.864
Yeah, he was...
he was great.

32:16.866 --> 32:20.101
It was... weird.

32:20.103 --> 32:24.905
Different.
Looser.

32:24.907 --> 32:30.447
It was...
just different.

32:35.051 --> 32:39.120
But you...
you're okay?

32:39.122 --> 32:41.021
Yeah.

32:41.023 --> 32:43.860
Yeah,
I'm... I'm great.

32:46.163 --> 32:48.729
Wow.

32:48.731 --> 32:50.332
Wow.

32:52.134 --> 32:54.035
It worked.

32:59.776 --> 33:00.978
Looser?

33:02.746 --> 33:05.713
Yeah, just...

33:05.715 --> 33:09.718
Um, like he was...

33:09.720 --> 33:11.786
I don't know,
like, um...

33:11.788 --> 33:15.055
everywhere at once
and all over the place.

33:15.057 --> 33:17.257
Um, but it was...
it was just fun.

33:17.259 --> 33:19.760
Like, am I s-stiff or...

33:19.762 --> 33:23.297
No.
No, you're great.

33:23.299 --> 33:25.568
You're the standard.

33:28.270 --> 33:32.039
Did you do everything?

33:32.041 --> 33:34.778
A lot of things.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.886
Great.

33:45.888 --> 33:48.055
Yeah.

33:48.057 --> 33:50.859
Yeah, it worked.
It was just fun.

33:50.861 --> 33:52.663
Yeah.

34:17.753 --> 34:20.320
- It went well?
- It was better than that.

34:20.322 --> 34:21.621
Okay, please,
spare me the details.

34:21.623 --> 34:23.925
- You guys are fucking crazy.
- No, he was nice.

34:23.927 --> 34:26.393
- He was nice to her.
- I'm glad of that.

34:26.396 --> 34:28.429
- And Will?
- He was fine.

34:28.431 --> 34:30.164
I think he was fine.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.900
This was all your idea.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.768
He's a composer.
He played me one of his songs.

34:34.771 --> 34:37.137
- Okay, you can't see him again.
- Why?

34:37.139 --> 34:40.440
Look, sex is sex,
and that's great, you know,

34:40.443 --> 34:41.376
but that's what
you agreed to.

34:41.378 --> 34:44.945
Just...
Just be careful.

34:44.947 --> 34:47.114
You realize this is
a suicide pact, right?

34:47.117 --> 34:49.248
You have to do it now.
You're committed.

34:49.251 --> 34:51.186
Otherwise, she's out there
on the hook forever.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.420
You're so dramatic.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.255
You know that's literally
the worst thing

34:53.257 --> 34:55.422
you can say to a gay man?

34:55.425 --> 34:57.325
What are you staring at?

34:57.327 --> 34:59.226
Nothing.

34:59.228 --> 35:01.496
Hi.

35:01.498 --> 35:03.398
Oh.
Hello again.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.999
Hello again.

35:06.001 --> 35:08.869
Um, so, I'd like
to buy this table.

35:08.871 --> 35:11.305
Really?
This... Wow.

35:11.307 --> 35:12.307
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:12.309 --> 35:13.608
Well, that's,
uh, that's great.

35:13.610 --> 35:17.412
I know. I-I couldn't get it
out of my mind, actually.

35:17.414 --> 35:19.514
Let me just take
your details down

35:19.516 --> 35:21.215
and schedule a delivery.

35:21.217 --> 35:22.516
I'm available right now.

35:22.518 --> 35:24.786
Oh. I...
Well, I...

35:24.788 --> 35:27.822
I'm kind of, you know,
the store's open, and...

35:27.824 --> 35:29.990
Mm-hmm.

35:29.992 --> 35:32.927
Well, why don't you
just close the store?

35:32.929 --> 35:34.061
I...

35:34.063 --> 35:37.264
I'm totally kidding.
I could be free tonight.

35:37.266 --> 35:42.903
Oh, well, I could also
potentially be... be available

35:42.905 --> 35:48.909
to deliver this table
to your address.

35:48.911 --> 35:52.412
Well, then,
it's potentially a date.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.220
Hi.

35:59.222 --> 36:01.057
Oh, hey.

36:02.192 --> 36:03.925
Were you watching porn?

36:03.927 --> 36:05.492
No.

36:05.494 --> 36:07.061
- You watching weird shit?
- No.

36:07.063 --> 36:09.930
Animals or something? Tentacles, eggplants?

36:09.932 --> 36:12.036
No.

36:13.135 --> 36:18.007
Nope. I got to go.
I have drinks.

36:18.974 --> 36:20.243
Bye.

36:28.552 --> 36:30.818
<i>...you can make.</i>

36:30.820 --> 36:32.320
<i>When our family's journey
began,</i>

36:32.322 --> 36:34.988
<i>we decided adoption
was the answer</i>

36:34.990 --> 36:37.891
<i>to what our family
had been missing,</i>

36:37.893 --> 36:43.331
<i>a joy and love which I,
at first...</i>

36:45.835 --> 36:48.971
Hello?

36:50.373 --> 36:52.842
Lydia?

36:53.577 --> 36:56.280
The doorman let me in.

36:58.181 --> 37:01.115
Lydia?

37:01.117 --> 37:03.918
Wow.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.387
It's... It's Will.

37:06.389 --> 37:09.827
Where do you want this table?

37:15.965 --> 37:17.565
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's perfect.

37:17.567 --> 37:19.534
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

37:19.536 --> 37:21.401
Cool place.

37:21.403 --> 37:23.139
Thank you.

37:29.545 --> 37:32.146
That's better, huh?

37:33.349 --> 37:34.983
Can I get you something
to drink, maybe?

37:34.985 --> 37:39.954
Iced tea or white wine?

37:39.956 --> 37:42.090
I'm... I'm fine.

37:45.427 --> 37:48.162
I'm obsessed
with this stuff.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.182
You want to dance?

38:09.952 --> 38:12.686
- S-Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

38:15.458 --> 38:17.191
I like this music.

38:17.193 --> 38:19.327
Yeah.

38:21.463 --> 38:22.829
You smell like my father.

38:51.561 --> 38:52.959
What the fuck
are you doing?

38:52.961 --> 38:56.934
It's the middle of the night?
We got kids over here!

38:58.268 --> 38:59.266
Sorry.

38:59.268 --> 39:02.269
This is Park Slope,
asshole.

39:02.271 --> 39:04.639
Sorry.

39:04.641 --> 39:06.340
Fuck.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.450
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:19.989 --> 39:21.488
I made dinner.

39:21.490 --> 39:25.392
Oh, you cooked?
Huh.

39:25.394 --> 39:28.362
Uh...

39:28.364 --> 39:30.030
You didn't call.

39:30.032 --> 39:32.532
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Don't.

39:32.534 --> 39:34.168
Just fucking
don't do that to me.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.604
Why?
I-I went to the house.

39:36.606 --> 39:38.706
Till midnight
with your phone off?

39:38.708 --> 39:40.641
No.

39:40.643 --> 39:45.012
I... met somebody.

39:45.014 --> 39:47.148
And then I went
to the house.

39:47.150 --> 39:49.282
You fucked someone
in our new house?

39:49.284 --> 39:52.186
No, I-I went there after
to work.

39:52.188 --> 39:55.289
Right.
But I'm suppo...

39:55.291 --> 39:59.059
I mean, you're supposed to
tell me when you're gonna...

39:59.061 --> 40:00.628
I-I was worried
about you.

40:00.630 --> 40:03.664
I'm sorry.

40:03.666 --> 40:06.666
What's her name?

40:10.739 --> 40:13.075
Lydia.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.480
Lydia.

40:17.447 --> 40:18.713
Great.
Cool.

40:18.715 --> 40:19.713
I'm sorry.
I should've called.

40:19.715 --> 40:23.050
I-I didn't
do anything wrong.

40:23.052 --> 40:24.552
Yes, you did.

40:24.554 --> 40:26.753
Lydia is... is great.

40:26.755 --> 40:29.657
Lydia is probably
a great person.

40:29.659 --> 40:33.494
I'm... not angry
with Lydia.

41:12.402 --> 41:14.769
Earthquake!
Earthquake!

41:14.771 --> 41:17.237
Earthquake!
Wake up! We have to go!

41:17.239 --> 41:18.840
Get in the bunker!
Come on!

41:18.842 --> 41:20.608
It's an earthqu...

41:22.612 --> 41:24.778
Oh, my God.
What?

41:24.780 --> 41:26.680
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

41:26.682 --> 41:28.682
I'm sorry.

41:28.684 --> 41:31.119
Aftershock.

41:31.121 --> 41:32.787
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

41:33.889 --> 41:35.123
Tsunami!

41:36.425 --> 41:38.291
I can't breathe!

41:38.293 --> 41:40.661
So, Lydia...
where did you meet?

41:40.663 --> 41:42.162
- At the shop.
- Huh.

41:42.164 --> 41:43.231
She bought a table.

41:43.233 --> 41:44.731
Excellent customer service.

41:44.733 --> 41:46.867
- Not my best, actually.
- Why?

41:46.869 --> 41:48.903
Well, it was
just kind of scary.

41:48.905 --> 41:51.838
She was looking at me
all naked.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.508
S-She had big hands.
It was weird.

41:54.510 --> 41:55.575
Did you enjoy it?

41:55.577 --> 41:58.278
I guess, after a while.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.680
After a while? How many...
How many times did you...

42:00.682 --> 42:01.849
Oh, just once.

42:01.851 --> 42:03.316
Oh.

42:03.318 --> 42:05.820
Oh, you lasted a while.

42:05.822 --> 42:07.521
We did it on the table,
which was weird.

42:07.523 --> 42:08.889
I couldn't...
I couldn't finish,

42:08.891 --> 42:11.659
so I... I panicked,
and I faked it.

42:11.661 --> 42:14.528
You faked... Wait,
how is that even possible?

42:14.530 --> 42:16.296
What did you,
just spit on her back?

42:16.298 --> 42:19.302
No.
No, I just, like...

42:20.170 --> 42:22.170
- Oh, that's very convincing.
- Thank you.

42:22.172 --> 42:24.704
Did you have to pretend with, uh...

42:24.706 --> 42:25.840
- Dane?
- Mm.

42:25.842 --> 42:27.307
- No. No.
- No?

42:27.309 --> 42:28.441
- You just...
- No.

42:28.443 --> 42:30.278
What, you didn't feel
like pretending or...?

42:30.280 --> 42:33.280
No, I...
I don't know.

42:33.282 --> 42:34.949
I was probably
just nervous and...

42:34.951 --> 42:37.418
Right, right.
It's just friction, right?

42:37.420 --> 42:39.787
Right.
You should see her again.

42:39.789 --> 42:40.887
- Hmm?
- Lydia.

42:40.889 --> 42:43.125
I don't know.

42:44.626 --> 42:46.262
You want to see him again?

42:48.864 --> 42:51.200
Yes.

42:52.802 --> 42:55.572
All right.

43:02.711 --> 43:05.114
Come on, Axel.

43:09.452 --> 43:13.320
Axel, no! Bad boy!
Go over there!

43:13.322 --> 43:14.956
- Oh, hi again.
- Hey.

43:14.958 --> 43:16.423
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:16.425 --> 43:18.892
Yikes.
I think I just passed out.

43:18.894 --> 43:20.394
Is he sleeping
any better for you?

43:20.396 --> 43:23.331
Oh, God, no.
No, no, not at all.

43:23.333 --> 43:25.365
I tell you what...
I would trade my apartment

43:25.367 --> 43:27.467
for six hours of uninterrupted
sleep at this point.

43:27.469 --> 43:29.869
- Wow. That bad?
- Yeah. Yeah.

43:29.871 --> 43:31.505
You know, I-I write,

43:31.507 --> 43:35.409
so my office has been
turned into a baby's room.

43:35.411 --> 43:36.978
It's a little tough
with deadlines

43:36.980 --> 43:40.250
and things like that
to sort of...

43:42.018 --> 43:43.416
You want to hold him?

43:43.418 --> 43:44.083
Yeah.

43:44.085 --> 43:45.586
- Yeah?
- Sure.

43:45.588 --> 43:47.021
Take a seat.

43:47.023 --> 43:51.992
Hey, Aidan, I'd like
to introduce you to Hale.

43:51.994 --> 43:53.461
Hale, Aidan.

43:53.463 --> 43:56.831
Hi, Aidan.

43:56.833 --> 44:01.001
Hi, baby.
You must be so much fun.

44:01.003 --> 44:03.637
He's so...

44:05.807 --> 44:06.907
He's sleeping.

44:06.909 --> 44:09.276
What do you think
he's dreaming about?

44:09.278 --> 44:13.382
Oh, I bet it's you, too.
I bet it's you, too.

44:14.784 --> 44:15.916
Where's the check?

44:15.918 --> 44:17.717
I don't know.
This place fucking sucks.

44:17.719 --> 44:20.689
I'm never coming
to Chelsea again.

44:23.393 --> 44:27.327
Hey.

44:27.329 --> 44:29.665
Are we gonna talk
about it?

44:30.833 --> 44:32.999
Are you growing
a moustache?

44:33.001 --> 44:35.903
Um... yeah?

44:35.905 --> 44:37.003
Yeah?

44:37.005 --> 44:39.039
Yeah, I just thought
I'd try something new.

44:39.041 --> 44:40.641
It's a little bit
like the...

44:40.643 --> 44:42.443
like the creepy kid
in gym class.

44:42.445 --> 44:43.744
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:43.746 --> 44:46.646
Just... Just very fond
of your upper lip as it was.

44:46.648 --> 44:47.947
Oh, thanks.

44:47.949 --> 44:50.050
It's a compliment.

44:50.052 --> 44:52.385
Where's the fucking
waiter?

44:52.387 --> 44:54.387
I'm gonna ruin
their lives on Yelp.

44:54.389 --> 44:56.691
Reece, calm down.

44:56.693 --> 44:58.626
I mean, don't...

44:58.628 --> 45:00.728
Don't you think
they're fucking crazy?

45:00.730 --> 45:02.229
I mean, Will and Anna?

45:02.231 --> 45:05.865
I mean why risk what they have,
right, I mean, for some...

45:05.867 --> 45:08.469
- If they're not happy...
- Yeah, but aren't they?

45:08.471 --> 45:10.503
Like, are they not happy,
or are they just bored in bed?

45:10.505 --> 45:13.409
- Famous last words.
- Yeah.

45:26.922 --> 45:28.621
I love you so much.

45:31.427 --> 45:34.396
Reece,
can we have a baby?

45:42.137 --> 45:43.670
- What?
- Why would you do that?

45:43.672 --> 45:45.373
Why would you say that
right now?

45:45.375 --> 45:46.840
Why can't
you just be with me?

45:46.842 --> 45:48.909
Reece.

45:55.150 --> 45:57.050
Is he bigger than me?

45:57.052 --> 45:59.388
Seriously?

46:00.489 --> 46:02.490
Okay.

46:02.492 --> 46:05.793
Um, he's somewhere
between...

46:05.795 --> 46:09.929
like this and like this.

46:09.931 --> 46:12.666
Come on.

46:12.668 --> 46:15.536
Are you... Are you thinking
about his now?

46:15.538 --> 46:16.470
No.

46:18.173 --> 46:22.311
I mean,
yours is nicer, honestly.

46:27.115 --> 46:29.749
Is he better, though?

46:29.751 --> 46:31.117
Come on.
You're being silly.

46:31.119 --> 46:32.219
- Was he?
- It was different.

46:32.221 --> 46:34.155
- Different better?
- Different different.

46:34.157 --> 46:35.255
I don't know.
He wasn't...

46:35.257 --> 46:38.360
He wasn't careful
with me, which is...

46:41.563 --> 46:43.697
You and Anna
ever talk about kids?

46:43.699 --> 46:44.999
Why?
Did she say something?

46:45.001 --> 46:46.367
No.

46:46.369 --> 46:48.769
Just wanted to know
if I'm framing out a nursery.

46:48.771 --> 46:50.838
It's a closet.

46:51.974 --> 46:54.508
But you want 'em?

46:54.510 --> 46:56.876
- Yeah, sure, eventually.
- Really?

46:56.878 --> 47:00.146
When this is done
and she's finished her degree,

47:00.148 --> 47:01.081
I guess it would be good.

47:01.083 --> 47:03.552
Yeah,
I guess that makes sense.

47:04.719 --> 47:06.653
Hey, man, those...
those braces aren't straight.

47:06.655 --> 47:08.688
I can see it from here.

47:08.690 --> 47:10.858
It's solid.

47:10.860 --> 47:12.726
It's gonna be covered over.
It's fine.

47:12.728 --> 47:14.829
- I'll do it myself.
- It's a closet!

47:14.831 --> 47:16.130
All right. I'll redo it.
I'll redo it.

47:16.132 --> 47:18.568
It's fine.
I'll redo it.

47:20.001 --> 47:22.802
It has to be perfect.

47:37.987 --> 47:40.423
Want to stay over?

47:43.759 --> 47:46.494
We... We don't
have to do anything.

47:46.496 --> 47:48.896
What, we could just
sit there in silence?

47:48.898 --> 47:54.267
Sure, if you like, yeah.
We could also talk or, uh...

47:54.269 --> 47:55.903
Well, you could tell me
about your thesis.

47:55.905 --> 47:59.206
I can pretend
to understand, and...

47:59.208 --> 48:00.907
I'd love to, but...

48:00.909 --> 48:02.642
Make you breakfast
in the morning.

48:02.644 --> 48:05.912
I should really go home.

48:05.914 --> 48:07.581
No.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.617
No, you really shouldn't.

48:14.523 --> 48:17.693
Sorry.
I didn't mean to push it.

48:19.061 --> 48:20.728
Just...

48:20.730 --> 48:23.733
Just tell me
you feel it, too.

48:26.101 --> 48:29.004
One foot
in front of the other.

48:32.742 --> 48:34.575
I don't understand, Anna.

48:34.577 --> 48:37.010
This thesis draft
is far below your potential.

48:37.012 --> 48:39.246
You're still writing
like a performance major,

48:39.248 --> 48:41.014
not a music history scholar.

48:41.016 --> 48:42.682
What's going on with you?

48:42.684 --> 48:45.552
- Anna. Anna!
- <i>♪ I'll find you... ♪</i>

48:47.623 --> 48:48.789
Are you all right?

48:48.791 --> 48:51.925
Yeah, I just...

48:51.927 --> 48:54.094
I got to...

48:54.096 --> 48:56.032
Got to go.

49:21.123 --> 49:22.655
Don't like that piece?

49:22.657 --> 49:24.592
Sorry,
I-I didn't see you.

49:24.594 --> 49:26.961
It's all right.
I'm barely here.

49:26.963 --> 49:31.632
- It is a divisive work, provokes a response.
- Does it?

49:31.634 --> 49:33.733
I agree, there are
far more beautiful things

49:33.735 --> 49:36.869
in the gallery
at the moment.

49:39.141 --> 49:42.742
Need a coffee?
Want coffee?

49:44.880 --> 49:46.914
Yeah.

49:46.916 --> 49:49.883
Be right back.

49:59.628 --> 50:01.929
Actually,
I don't need a coffee.

50:11.340 --> 50:13.072
Why don't you
give me your number?

50:13.074 --> 50:15.777
I'd like to see you again.

50:18.213 --> 50:19.713
You gonna tell your wife?

50:19.715 --> 50:22.316
Uh... no, I'm not.

50:22.318 --> 50:25.119
So you... you have
an agreement.

50:25.121 --> 50:27.320
What she doesn't know
she doesn't have to agree to.

50:27.322 --> 50:28.921
You know,
she might not mind.

50:28.923 --> 50:30.990
Just... give me
your number.

50:30.992 --> 50:32.925
No. Look.
Unless you tell her, you...

50:32.927 --> 50:35.061
You have to...
You have to get her permission.

50:35.063 --> 50:36.329
I already told you,
that's not how we are.

50:36.331 --> 50:37.430
Well,
I guess it's how <i>I</i> am.

50:37.432 --> 50:38.666
Not according
to recent events, it's not.

50:38.668 --> 50:41.834
Look, I'm not gonna ruin
my marriage for you, okay,

50:41.836 --> 50:45.338
so thanks for the fuck,
but Jesus.

50:45.340 --> 50:47.840
I'm sure you remember
where the door is.

50:59.954 --> 51:01.354
Another one already?

51:01.356 --> 51:03.791
- Yeah, it just... it just happened.
- Wow.

51:03.793 --> 51:05.458
Oh, can you just...

51:11.266 --> 51:14.169
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

51:18.373 --> 51:22.775
Should we just...

51:22.777 --> 51:27.780
You want to...
you know, should we just stop?

51:27.782 --> 51:31.086
Is it worth it?
Hmm?

51:34.389 --> 51:35.856
No.

51:35.858 --> 51:38.391
No, I'm okay.
Really.

51:38.393 --> 51:41.061
You're okay?

51:41.063 --> 51:43.296
I'm okay.

51:43.298 --> 51:46.066
Well,
if you're okay, then...

51:47.737 --> 51:49.135
I'm okay, so...

51:49.137 --> 51:51.371
You want a drink?
I could go and...

51:51.373 --> 51:54.874
No, I'm... I'm kind of tired.
I want to go home.

51:54.876 --> 51:56.110
Really?

51:56.112 --> 51:58.047
Yeah, I don't want to...

52:00.449 --> 52:02.014
- You... You can stay...
- I might.

52:02.016 --> 52:04.686
- ...if you want.
- I might do that.

52:08.056 --> 52:12.325
Okay.
Well...

52:12.327 --> 52:13.494
See you at home.

52:13.496 --> 52:15.865
Yeah.
See you at home.

52:29.445 --> 52:31.845
Done nursing that ice water?

52:31.847 --> 52:34.213
Oh, it's... it's mescal.

52:34.215 --> 52:37.184
Not anymore.
Rocks?

52:37.186 --> 52:38.385
S-Sure.

52:40.856 --> 52:42.889
Hey, I have to work
tomorrow, so...

52:42.891 --> 52:44.458
Oh, yeah?
What's your work?

52:44.460 --> 52:46.959
I teach high school.

52:46.961 --> 52:47.994
Hmm.

52:47.996 --> 52:51.164
Good kids,
tough neighborhood.

52:51.166 --> 52:53.467
And where's your wife?

52:53.469 --> 52:55.405
My what?

52:56.304 --> 52:58.905
Oh, that's my girlfriend.
She's at home.

52:58.907 --> 53:01.008
- But you're here.
- So it seems.

53:01.010 --> 53:02.441
Well,
it you want to pull,

53:02.443 --> 53:04.144
all you have to do
is stick around

53:04.146 --> 53:06.249
and drastically lower
your standards.

53:10.485 --> 53:13.487
Oh.
Oh, God.

53:13.489 --> 53:15.824
Oh.

53:16.992 --> 53:19.425
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

53:27.969 --> 53:30.238
I'm not asleep.

53:32.507 --> 53:35.141
Good drink?

53:37.445 --> 53:39.715
No.

53:42.150 --> 53:44.119
Hmm.

53:59.235 --> 54:00.467
It's late.

54:00.469 --> 54:02.271
Sorry.

54:04.139 --> 54:06.072
Fuck.
That's a lot of money.

54:06.074 --> 54:07.574
Yeah.

54:07.576 --> 54:12.378
They're all like this.
Surrogacy's expensive.

54:12.380 --> 54:14.548
It's not expensive.
That's a fucking fortune.

54:14.550 --> 54:15.949
Can we at least
talk about it?

54:15.951 --> 54:18.251
When you shave your moustache,
you can talk about it.

54:18.253 --> 54:20.887
- Can you be serious, please?
- I am serious.

54:20.889 --> 54:22.356
Can we try
to figure this out?

54:22.358 --> 54:25.291
You're so fucking stubborn.
Don't I get a say in the matter?

54:25.293 --> 54:26.693
You would if you
ever talked to me.

54:26.695 --> 54:29.195
Has it ever occurred to you that
there might be a good reason

54:29.197 --> 54:31.298
why I don't want to do it
or why I'm hesitant to do it?

54:31.300 --> 54:34.001
If it's about the money,
we can try fostering.

54:34.003 --> 54:36.670
Foster kids come damaged.

54:36.672 --> 54:38.405
Adoption... they can
come take them away.

54:38.407 --> 54:39.405
We have lives!

54:39.407 --> 54:40.606
We have a life
that we built.

54:40.608 --> 54:41.641
Look at it!

54:41.643 --> 54:44.344
Can you picture
a child in it?

54:44.346 --> 54:46.079
Yeah, well, I was trying.

54:46.081 --> 54:49.349
You haven't thought
about any of this, have you?

54:49.351 --> 54:52.954
It's some... It's some
beautiful fantasy for you.

54:54.690 --> 54:57.958
Yes, I've thought...
I've thought about it.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.329
Come to bed...
eventually.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.467
She sign
the delivery receipt?

55:07.469 --> 55:10.003
- Yeah.
- Good.

55:10.005 --> 55:12.405
Ms. Gretel Winthrop?

55:12.407 --> 55:14.340
That's a funny name.

55:14.342 --> 55:15.541
She was nice, though.

55:15.543 --> 55:17.846
Yeah?
How nice was she?

55:18.681 --> 55:21.648
I'm starting to fear for the
safety of our female customers.

55:21.650 --> 55:22.816
You come in for a bookshelf,

55:22.818 --> 55:24.083
might get more
than you bargained for.

55:24.085 --> 55:27.153
- Not today, okay?
- Old bird like that, though,

55:27.155 --> 55:28.588
I guess she won't mind
that you're an amateur.

55:28.590 --> 55:29.988
You don't have to be
an asshole.

55:29.990 --> 55:32.659
- I'm not trying to fuck everyone I meet.
- Oh, yeah?

55:32.661 --> 55:34.226
What was the road
to Hell paved with?

55:34.228 --> 55:36.031
Remind me.

55:36.998 --> 55:38.231
Because it's working,
does that...

55:38.233 --> 55:39.967
- does that threaten you?
- No, man.

55:39.969 --> 55:41.434
Shit would never happen
in my house.

55:41.436 --> 55:45.273
This doesn't threaten me.
Just makes me sad, that's all.

55:46.342 --> 55:48.342
You still seeing
that other lady?

55:48.344 --> 55:49.575
- Lydia?
- Yeah.

55:49.577 --> 55:50.744
Yeah.

55:50.746 --> 55:52.979
Care about her at all?

55:52.981 --> 55:55.148
Sure.
Of course.

55:55.150 --> 55:58.318
What's she do?
What are her interests?

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320
Where's she from?

56:00.322 --> 56:01.554
Nothing?

56:01.556 --> 56:02.688
You know what?
Fuck you.

56:02.690 --> 56:04.657
I guess you know
who the asshole is, huh?

56:04.659 --> 56:05.726
You gonna leave me
to drive back

56:05.728 --> 56:08.965
'cause I hurt
your fucking feelings?

56:15.503 --> 56:17.405
Hello.

56:19.173 --> 56:21.141
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

56:21.143 --> 56:23.209
Hi.
Oh, wow.

56:23.211 --> 56:26.079
You're... 12 hours early.

56:26.081 --> 56:28.347
Oh, you meant 9:00 at night?
I can come back.

56:28.349 --> 56:29.749
No. No, you're here.

56:29.751 --> 56:30.918
- It's okay.
- Right.

56:30.920 --> 56:34.054
It's just, oh, my God,
the place is a mess.

56:34.056 --> 56:35.588
We haven't finished.

56:35.590 --> 56:38.557
Inga, <i>det racker nu...
det racker nu.</i>

56:38.559 --> 56:41.094
You can finish.

56:41.096 --> 56:44.731
<i>Finito.</i>
Okay.

56:44.733 --> 56:46.700
You don't have
to have so much attitude.

56:46.702 --> 56:47.833
Did you see that?

56:47.835 --> 56:49.735
Makes me feel so insecure
about my Swedish.

56:49.737 --> 56:51.438
I don't think
that's Swedish.

56:51.440 --> 56:52.738
Well, I mean, it might
be a little Norwegian,

56:52.740 --> 56:54.641
but it doesn't matter.

56:54.643 --> 56:55.842
Well, you just...
you caught me.

56:55.844 --> 56:59.211
I was in the middle
of doing my new workout.

56:59.213 --> 57:05.084
It's... a little bit of yoga
and folding laundry.

57:05.086 --> 57:06.586
I call it "yolaundry."

57:07.889 --> 57:10.557
Well, I've never been
on a date this early before.

57:10.559 --> 57:12.258
Um...

57:12.260 --> 57:15.095
So, um, here.
Let me take your coat.

57:15.097 --> 57:16.729
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

57:16.731 --> 57:18.597
Did you have anything
special in mind?

57:18.599 --> 57:21.068
No plans, exactly,
but, um...

57:21.070 --> 57:24.237
You know, we didn't really
talk much last time, so...

57:24.239 --> 57:27.139
Well, um, you want
to get to know each other?

57:27.141 --> 57:28.474
Exactly. Yeah.

57:28.476 --> 57:30.242
Really well?

57:31.112 --> 57:33.447
Yeah.
What's that look for?

57:33.449 --> 57:37.450
You ever sometimes feel like
just, you know,

57:37.452 --> 57:39.318
like going wild?

57:40.755 --> 57:42.356
I mean...

57:48.831 --> 57:50.396
Oh.

57:50.398 --> 57:52.099
Yeah.
Don't worry.

57:52.101 --> 57:53.133
I know the girl
who made them.

57:53.135 --> 57:55.769
Oh, I'm not...
I'm not worried.

57:55.771 --> 57:57.637
Yeah?
Tell that to your face.

57:59.541 --> 58:01.273
What are they?

58:01.275 --> 58:04.110
Um,
probably a lot of fun.

58:04.112 --> 58:05.878
Are you serious?

58:07.782 --> 58:09.583
- Hmm?
- All right.

58:09.585 --> 58:10.883
Yeah?

58:13.688 --> 58:16.590
You're fucking lovely.

58:16.592 --> 58:18.891
Hmm.
You think so?

58:18.893 --> 58:22.262
- Mm. Yeah.
- Hmm.

58:24.500 --> 58:29.603
You're a big softy.

58:29.605 --> 58:31.271
Is that...
Is that bad?

58:31.273 --> 58:34.708
Mnh-mnh.
Nothing's bad.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.445
We should, you know...

58:39.447 --> 58:41.882
We should, like,
be friends, you know?

58:41.884 --> 58:44.684
If you're...
If you're wo...

58:44.686 --> 58:46.552
Oh, wait, what?

58:46.554 --> 58:47.720
Should I stop talking?

58:47.722 --> 58:49.688
No.
You're fine.

58:49.690 --> 58:51.157
Yeah?

58:51.159 --> 58:54.396
You're so... perfect.

58:55.264 --> 58:58.831
The first time we had sex,
I didn't finish.

58:58.833 --> 58:59.900
Really?

58:59.902 --> 59:02.802
It's not you.
I... You're beautiful.

59:02.804 --> 59:04.704
You're beautiful.
I just...

59:04.706 --> 59:06.238
I-I couldn't.

59:06.240 --> 59:08.275
- We should fix that.
- Really?

59:08.277 --> 59:09.376
'Cause, like, you know,
that's...

59:09.378 --> 59:11.845
Sometimes
that happens with Anna.

59:11.847 --> 59:13.546
Who's Anna?

59:13.548 --> 59:15.849
I want to feel
like this all the time.

59:15.851 --> 59:19.219
Why don't I feel
like this all the time?

59:19.221 --> 59:24.758
Because you have
a stick...

59:24.760 --> 59:25.758
up your ass.

59:25.760 --> 59:27.961
That was definitely
your finger.

59:27.963 --> 59:29.528
- Shut up.
- Oh, my God.

59:29.530 --> 59:31.831
I don't...
I don't know if I can.

59:31.833 --> 59:34.467
Yes, you can.
Listen.

59:34.469 --> 59:36.269
What do you want to do
to me?

59:36.271 --> 59:37.737
Ooh, whatever you want.

59:37.739 --> 59:38.771
- No.
- Sorry.

59:38.773 --> 59:40.206
- Shut up.
- Ooh, sorry.

59:40.208 --> 59:44.644
What do you want?
Hmm?

59:44.646 --> 59:46.746
Anything.

59:46.748 --> 59:48.748
- I...
- Anything is allowed.

59:48.750 --> 59:50.249
- But I...
- Do it.

59:50.251 --> 59:51.885
- Um...
- Just do it.

59:51.887 --> 59:52.985
- I...
- Come on.

59:52.987 --> 59:53.954
- But...
- Just do it.

59:53.956 --> 59:56.356
You can do it.
Just do it.

59:56.358 --> 59:59.662
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:00:02.364 --> 01:00:03.496
Oh.

01:00:03.498 --> 01:00:05.798
Oh.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.901
Wow.

01:00:08.903 --> 01:00:09.903
I'm so sorry.

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:11.704
- No, no.
- I'm so sorry.

01:00:11.706 --> 01:00:12.938
No.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.008
It's okay.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.309
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:00:17.311 --> 01:00:20.313
It's okay.
Shush, shush.

01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:22.983
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:06.325
I'm sure it'll pass.

01:01:54.909 --> 01:01:56.742
I didn't know
you could play.

01:01:56.744 --> 01:01:59.345
Not very well anymore.

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:01.715
Thought it was what
I was gonna do, but, uh...

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:02.949
Now, keep going.

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:06.820
No.

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:08.621
What are you...
What are you doing?

01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:10.490
Since I know you're not
gonna stay the night,

01:02:10.492 --> 01:02:12.559
might as well
make you breakfast now.

01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:14.263
Really?

01:02:15.429 --> 01:02:17.363
No charge.
Compliments of the house.

01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:18.699
Part of the service.

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:20.733
You're really good,
and to think all this time,

01:02:20.735 --> 01:02:23.036
I've just been
using you for your body.

01:02:23.038 --> 01:02:24.604
Is that what's happening?

01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:25.841
Mm-hmm.

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:29.377
Can I kiss the cook?

01:02:33.914 --> 01:02:36.148
Come here.

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:37.784
I feel really good.
Don't you?

01:02:37.786 --> 01:02:44.124
I haven't felt
this good since...

01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:46.729
I don't know,
since my divorce.

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:53.633
Danny, Danny,
Danny, Danny.

01:02:53.635 --> 01:02:56.068
Um, I'm Will.

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.070
I'm talking about my ex.

01:02:58.072 --> 01:02:59.438
Right.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.840
- You idiot.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:05.545
No, you just think that you...
that you meet the one, right,

01:03:05.547 --> 01:03:07.947
but there can't
just be one.

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:09.148
How can there
just be one?

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:10.816
I don't know.

01:03:10.818 --> 01:03:14.690
I was a dental hygienist
before I met him.

01:03:16.123 --> 01:03:18.626
I guess I could get
a dog.

01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:23.729
I could...

01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:25.833
I could travel.

01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:31.003
Can I...
Can I ask you something?

01:03:33.641 --> 01:03:37.976
The table...

01:03:37.978 --> 01:03:39.711
Do you really like it?

01:03:39.713 --> 01:03:42.449
Oh, my God.

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.617
The table is so beautiful.

01:03:44.619 --> 01:03:45.751
Yeah?

01:03:45.753 --> 01:03:48.987
I love it.
It's just so honest.

01:03:48.989 --> 01:03:53.059
And I can love the table,
and I can want to fuck you.

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:57.162
One doesn't diminish
the other, you know?

01:03:57.164 --> 01:03:58.296
Cool.

01:03:58.298 --> 01:03:59.999
And I think we should
do this all the time.

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:02.135
Like, a lot.
Like, once a week.

01:04:02.137 --> 01:04:05.204
It's so...
It's so good to do.

01:04:05.206 --> 01:04:07.072
Mm.

01:04:07.074 --> 01:04:08.874
You should have some of this.

01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:11.878
I really wish we had, like,
a fresh coconut,

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.512
you know what I mean?

01:04:19.954 --> 01:04:21.487
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:04:21.489 --> 01:04:23.623
- Good?
- Mm.

01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:27.760
Okay, you can be honest.

01:04:27.762 --> 01:04:28.927
You have a kid?

01:04:28.929 --> 01:04:30.162
Huh?

01:04:34.635 --> 01:04:36.168
No, whatever it is,
it's fine.

01:04:38.639 --> 01:04:39.905
No.

01:04:39.907 --> 01:04:41.941
I don't have a kid.

01:04:44.244 --> 01:04:48.180
I keep thinking
I'll never see you again.

01:04:48.182 --> 01:04:51.184
Every time is like this,

01:04:51.186 --> 01:04:53.853
and then...
then you vanish.

01:04:58.927 --> 01:05:00.260
I see something in you.

01:05:06.134 --> 01:05:07.133
So give me something.

01:05:37.231 --> 01:05:41.099
It's 3:00.
You gonna come to bed?

01:05:41.101 --> 01:05:43.438
In a minute.

01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:47.574
This some kind
of punishment?

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:48.840
Not tired.

01:05:48.842 --> 01:05:51.446
No, uh,
the abstinence.

01:05:53.715 --> 01:05:54.713
I have a headache.

01:05:54.715 --> 01:05:56.249
- For a week?
- It's persistent.

01:05:57.619 --> 01:06:01.019
It's very big of you, this.
How long is this gonna go on?

01:06:01.021 --> 01:06:02.322
- Go to bed.
- Answer me.

01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:05.860
I just did.
Go to bed.

01:06:24.278 --> 01:06:26.012
Will, are you okay?

01:06:26.014 --> 01:06:26.979
Mm?

01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:29.048
Why's the TV
out in the street?

01:06:31.018 --> 01:06:33.720
I moved it.

01:06:33.722 --> 01:06:34.688
What?

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.155
You should
really see this.

01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:38.724
The hell is going on?

01:06:38.726 --> 01:06:41.827
It's really something, right?
Hey, we should get a telescope.

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:43.729
- How cool would that be?
- Okay, you're drunk.

01:06:43.731 --> 01:06:46.032
No, come here. Just...
Just sit down. Just relax.

01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:47.566
- Will.
- Give me your... Just give me your feet.

01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.769
- We have to talk.
- Just relax. Just look at the stars.

01:06:49.771 --> 01:06:51.170
Just give me your feet.

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:53.305
- Listen to me. I was just...
- Just give me your feet.

01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:55.807
- Shh. Give me your feet.
- ...with...

01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:57.342
Mm-hmm.

01:06:57.344 --> 01:06:58.978
Shit.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.248
Were you with Dane?
You smell like him.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:06.318
Yeah, I was.
I was with Dane.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.789
It's pretty amazing,
right?

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.891
Like, anything
is allowed, right?

01:07:11.893 --> 01:07:15.293
- Yeah, Will...
- Anything you want, you just do it.

01:07:15.295 --> 01:07:16.662
Just do it.

01:07:16.664 --> 01:07:18.331
- Sure.
- You know?

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:20.800
Whatever you want
to do to me,

01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:22.969
you know, you can
just do it, right?

01:07:22.971 --> 01:07:28.273
I mean, there must be something
you want to do to me

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:29.976
you just always
wanted to do...

01:07:29.978 --> 01:07:31.309
- No.
- ...you haven't told me.

01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:33.445
- No.
- Come on. Just...

01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:36.416
Why?
Are you, uh...

01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:39.786
hiding something
right now?

01:07:39.788 --> 01:07:41.021
What?

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.021
Because we know everything
about each other, Will.

01:07:43.023 --> 01:07:45.324
- Yeah. I don't mean...
- Yeah.

01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:47.226
So, what are you trying
to say?

01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:50.063
I...

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:52.831
Did you know that
I want a telescope?

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:54.166
Hmm?

01:07:54.168 --> 01:07:56.401
No.

01:07:56.403 --> 01:07:57.570
Okay.

01:07:57.572 --> 01:08:01.474
So you have secrets
that I don't know.

01:08:01.476 --> 01:08:04.242
Well, don't you?

01:08:04.244 --> 01:08:07.713
No.

01:08:07.715 --> 01:08:10.849
- Anna, it's... I...
- No, I don't.

01:08:10.851 --> 01:08:13.186
- Will, just tell me. What is it?
- It's nothing bad.

01:08:13.188 --> 01:08:15.220
Well, then, why have
you never told me before?

01:08:15.222 --> 01:08:17.456
- I just...
- Will, come on. What?

01:08:17.457 --> 01:08:20.859
I just always wanted
to spit in your mouth.

01:08:20.862 --> 01:08:23.129
What?

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:26.398
Out of context,
I guess it sounds weird.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:29.402
W-Why?

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:31.370
I-I don't know why.

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:35.308
Y-Y-You...
You want to s-spit on me?

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.410
I just think
it's... it's sexy.

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.044
It's disgusting.

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:40.412
Why would you want
to do that?

01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:42.247
No, no.
I don't want to...

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:45.151
No, I just... I'm sorry.
I don't want to do it to you.

01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:46.318
- I just...
- Y-You don't?

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.687
- No.
- Why not? What's wrong with me?

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.455
- Nothing.
- Why don't you want to spit in my mouth?

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.325
I do. I will.
I just...

01:08:52.327 --> 01:08:53.526
Only if you like it.

01:08:53.528 --> 01:09:00.165
W-Will, I-I want you
to want to spit in my mouth?

01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:01.933
Now?

01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:03.402
No!

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:06.404
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, no.

01:09:06.407 --> 01:09:09.040
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:09:09.042 --> 01:09:11.277
I'm sorry, too.
I love you.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.911
- I love you, too.
- I love you.

01:09:12.912 --> 01:09:14.179
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.249
- I love you. I love you.
- I love you. I love you.

01:09:17.318 --> 01:09:20.118
God, you stupid fuck.

01:09:26.327 --> 01:09:29.264
Hey.
I'm going.

01:09:30.497 --> 01:09:32.000
You didn't notice.

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:40.075
Can we talk about it now?

01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:44.211
I got to go.

01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:03.361
Shit.

01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:25.483
You ever miss
your life before having him?

01:10:25.485 --> 01:10:27.519
No...

01:10:27.521 --> 01:10:30.388
is what you're
supposed to say.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:31.690
But sometimes, yeah.

01:10:31.692 --> 01:10:35.628
I just used to have all this,
um... my freedom,

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.330
but it's been cannibalized
by this guy.

01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:39.866
Yeah.

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.133
But then he does
something cute

01:10:41.135 --> 01:10:43.602
with a spoon
and some applesauce,

01:10:43.604 --> 01:10:45.071
- and it doesn't matter.
- Right.

01:10:45.073 --> 01:10:47.540
But don't get me wrong...
it is hard as shit, you know?

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:50.610
But you get through it.

01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:52.210
You thinking about it?

01:10:52.212 --> 01:10:53.278
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.379
For a while.

01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:55.647
Cool.

01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:58.416
Well, what's stopping you?

01:10:58.418 --> 01:11:00.553
I don't know.

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:02.120
You'd make a great dad.

01:11:02.122 --> 01:11:04.022
You think?

01:11:04.024 --> 01:11:06.157
Yeah.
I mean, don't listen to me.

01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:08.027
Look at this guy...
he loves you.

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.198
Well, thank you.
And thank you.

01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:56.976
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

01:11:56.978 --> 01:11:58.544
You're new.

01:11:58.546 --> 01:11:59.946
Oh, my God,
you're so cute.

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:01.479
Uh, thank you.

01:12:01.481 --> 01:12:03.081
Uh, was somebody
helping you?

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:04.450
Will.
Will was helping me.

01:12:04.452 --> 01:12:05.718
Well,
they're out right now,

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.018
but if there's something
that I can help you with...

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.156
Well, no, I mean,
I was in before. I'm Lydia.

01:12:11.158 --> 01:12:13.960
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.361
So you're...
coming back for more?

01:12:16.363 --> 01:12:17.429
Yeah.

01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:19.365
You know, I thought
I would do,

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:20.599
like, the entire loft.

01:12:20.601 --> 01:12:22.500
- Uh-huh.
- Built-ins, a coffee table,

01:12:22.502 --> 01:12:23.936
and maybe
a dining-room table.

01:12:23.938 --> 01:12:26.104
There's just so much glass
and it's cold and it's hard

01:12:26.106 --> 01:12:27.205
and it's icky and ugh.

01:12:27.207 --> 01:12:28.607
You don't need to know
about that,

01:12:28.609 --> 01:12:30.108
but, yeah, but I just...

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:31.210
I need a fresh start.

01:12:31.212 --> 01:12:33.379
- A lot of work.
- You mean expensive?

01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:35.046
I don't give a shit.
It's not my money.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.651
My ex-husband
did incredibly well,

01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:40.385
but hey, fuck it.

01:12:40.387 --> 01:12:41.353
My lawyer was better,

01:12:41.355 --> 01:12:43.188
and I wasn't fucking
my secretary.

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:44.424
Like, what kind
of a guy does that?

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.525
It's, like, what year
were you living in?

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.625
I mean, the whole thing
is gross.

01:12:46.627 --> 01:12:48.827
I really should stop
talking about him.

01:12:48.829 --> 01:12:49.829
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can say whatever you want.

01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:51.030
You're very sweet.

01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:53.699
You're going, like,
"Aah, it's a crazy lady!

01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:55.300
Someone adjust her meds."

01:12:55.302 --> 01:12:57.236
They have. They did.
Meds have been adjusted.

01:12:57.238 --> 01:12:59.271
- Can't you tell?
- Oh, no, I... I didn't think...

01:12:59.273 --> 01:13:03.142
But, you know what, I just think
the whole thing is, um...

01:13:03.144 --> 01:13:06.012
I'm here because I think
this place is really cool

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:08.481
and what Will's doing
is so honest

01:13:08.483 --> 01:13:11.416
and he just shows that
you can do whatever you want.

01:13:11.418 --> 01:13:13.419
I mean,
you can start over again.

01:13:13.421 --> 01:13:18.557
You can start over again,
and it's, you know.

01:13:18.559 --> 01:13:21.027
I know.
Life is weird.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.660
It's fucking weird.
That's true.

01:13:22.662 --> 01:13:27.700
Well, I will tell Will that
you that you were... were here.

01:13:27.702 --> 01:13:29.701
Thank you.

01:13:29.703 --> 01:13:34.074
You're so... lovely.
What's your name?

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:38.143
Anna.

01:13:38.145 --> 01:13:40.312
Anna.

01:13:40.314 --> 01:13:41.983
Anna.

01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:46.785
Thank you.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:02.067
Dr. Bennett?

01:14:02.069 --> 01:14:05.204
Hey, Dr. Bennett.
I just, um...

01:14:05.206 --> 01:14:06.237
I-I'm so sorry
I didn't make it.

01:14:06.239 --> 01:14:08.273
I don't know
what's going on with you,

01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:10.476
why you're slipping
like this.

01:14:10.478 --> 01:14:15.447
You are on the verge of
an amazing academic career,

01:14:15.449 --> 01:14:19.250
but it feels like
you don't even want it.

01:14:19.252 --> 01:14:24.490
What do you want, Anna?
Get it together.

01:14:54.421 --> 01:14:56.388
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:59.458
You want to take a walk,
get a coffee or something?

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.393
I've got a better idea.
Come on.

01:15:01.395 --> 01:15:03.528
What?
What are we doing?

01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:04.830
Breaking and entering.

01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:05.865
What? Are you... Are you kidding?
What if we get...

01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:07.700
- Come on.
- What if we get caught?

01:15:07.702 --> 01:15:09.204
Come on.

01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:13.873
Oh, geez!
Look at that.

01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:16.174
Not bad, huh?

01:15:16.176 --> 01:15:18.177
Who... Wait, what is this?

01:15:18.179 --> 01:15:20.345
What does it look like?

01:15:20.347 --> 01:15:22.481
Uh...

01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:25.250
I don't know,
some kind of gesture?

01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:28.254
No.
It's just a piano.

01:15:35.829 --> 01:15:40.402
♪ So long, broken parts of me ♪

01:15:42.403 --> 01:15:50.345
♪ I will fix you up
inside my dream ♪

01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:55.313
♪ "Ours is but to do or die" ♪

01:15:55.315 --> 01:16:01.622

01:16:02.823 --> 01:16:06.424
♪ So long, broken parts of me ♪

01:16:06.426 --> 01:16:07.526
Aah!

01:16:07.528 --> 01:16:09.027
- What? What is it?
- Ugh. Cramp.

01:16:09.029 --> 01:16:12.197
- Ah, it's bad. Quick.
- Are you okay? Are you okay? What?

01:16:12.199 --> 01:16:14.599
Let me see.
Get up.

01:16:14.601 --> 01:16:16.335
- Play.
- What?

01:16:16.337 --> 01:16:18.204
Play.

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:20.305
Oh, you...

01:16:20.307 --> 01:16:22.875
No, you should definitely
play before we get arrested.

01:16:22.877 --> 01:16:25.611
Oh, I can't.
Not here. Not at... No.

01:16:25.613 --> 01:16:28.615
Please play.
Please?

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:36.391
Um...

01:18:00.573 --> 01:18:02.040
Beautiful.

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:03.741
- Anna...
- Dane, um...

01:18:03.743 --> 01:18:05.443
I, um...

01:18:05.445 --> 01:18:06.879
- I-I can't stop thinking...
- Dane.

01:18:06.881 --> 01:18:10.549
I-I'm an articulate person,
so just... just let me...

01:18:10.551 --> 01:18:13.451
Ah! You're incredible.

01:18:13.453 --> 01:18:15.687
I love this,
spending time with you, and...

01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:17.723
Hey, listen, I know
it's new and that it...

01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:21.660
it scares you, and I don't
want to rush it,

01:18:21.662 --> 01:18:23.062
- and I don't...
- That's... That's what I-I want to...

01:18:23.064 --> 01:18:25.363
Will you go out with me?

01:18:25.365 --> 01:18:26.999
What am I, 16?

01:18:27.001 --> 01:18:28.802
I...

01:18:30.003 --> 01:18:31.738
Please say something.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.875
Dane, it's...
it's too much.

01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:38.410
Oh, no.
Fuck.

01:18:38.412 --> 01:18:39.577
- No, please, please, please, please.
- No, wait, stop.

01:18:39.579 --> 01:18:40.344
I take it back.
I didn't say anything.

01:18:40.346 --> 01:18:42.615
We don't know each other.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:43.950
- I know how I make you feel.
- No.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.050
Everything that... that you
think that you're feeling...

01:18:45.052 --> 01:18:46.117
Well, tell me...
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:18:46.119 --> 01:18:48.253
Everything that
you feel, it isn't real.

01:18:48.255 --> 01:18:51.357
- You don't know that, okay?
- No, I do!

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.392
It's not real.
This isn't real!

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.329
It's real to me.

01:18:57.832 --> 01:19:00.335
Just give it a chance.

01:19:01.502 --> 01:19:03.000
No.

01:19:03.002 --> 01:19:04.469
Why?
Why?

01:19:04.471 --> 01:19:06.104
Because I don't feel
the same way.

01:19:06.106 --> 01:19:07.805
Yes, you do.
Clearly, you do.

01:19:07.807 --> 01:19:09.407
- How would you...
- You're still standing here

01:19:09.409 --> 01:19:10.742
trying to convince me
that you don't.

01:19:10.744 --> 01:19:13.445
I was fucking you, Dane!

01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:16.384
I was just fucking you.

01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:25.525
You're lying.
Lying!

01:19:37.704 --> 01:19:39.170
You're here.

01:19:39.172 --> 01:19:42.609
Hi.
Yeah, like clockwork, right?

01:19:46.913 --> 01:19:48.746
You okay?

01:19:48.748 --> 01:19:51.849
I don't know.

01:19:51.851 --> 01:19:54.452
Uh, actually, um...

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:58.022
This might be dumb
or whatever, but, uh...

01:19:58.024 --> 01:20:01.093
meeting you,
it's helped me a lot.

01:20:01.095 --> 01:20:04.996
Good.
I'm glad I could help.

01:20:04.998 --> 01:20:06.768
Good.

01:20:08.702 --> 01:20:10.872
Good.

01:20:14.908 --> 01:20:18.777
Hale, you, uh...
Well, you know I'm not...

01:20:18.779 --> 01:20:22.046
Yeah, yeah.
No, that's not why I...

01:20:22.048 --> 01:20:23.115
- Oh, my God.
- ...said anything.

01:20:23.117 --> 01:20:24.750
I'm sorry.
It's ridiculous of me.

01:20:24.752 --> 01:20:25.951
- No, I can understand why...
- No, I... No, no, no, that's tacky.

01:20:25.953 --> 01:20:28.253
I don't know why
I made that assumption.

01:20:28.255 --> 01:20:31.592
No, no. Really.
You just listen to me.

01:20:34.228 --> 01:20:36.431
Well,
I'm glad I could help.

01:20:37.564 --> 01:20:40.701
I don't know what to do.

01:20:44.904 --> 01:20:46.340
None of us do.

01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:49.974
The big secret.

01:20:49.976 --> 01:20:51.910
Yeah, I mean...

01:20:51.912 --> 01:20:53.581
No, it's...

01:20:54.715 --> 01:20:57.014
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:20:57.016 --> 01:20:58.817
Where have you been?

01:20:58.819 --> 01:21:01.786
Um, Glenn, this is...
Reece.

01:21:01.788 --> 01:21:03.554
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:21:03.556 --> 01:21:06.258
I'm the boyfriend.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.927
I'm Glenn.

01:21:08.929 --> 01:21:11.496
Um...

01:21:11.498 --> 01:21:13.999
Well, I-I better get him
home before he wakes up.

01:21:14.001 --> 01:21:16.034
Um...

01:21:16.036 --> 01:21:18.504
Nice meeting you.

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:22.040
You, uh...

01:21:22.042 --> 01:21:23.075
You okay?

01:21:23.077 --> 01:21:25.780
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

01:21:33.153 --> 01:21:34.352
- Who was that?
- It's a friend.

01:21:34.354 --> 01:21:36.187
- Oh, yeah? Friend?
- He's a friend.

01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:37.623
A friend I don't know
about?

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:38.790
He's just a friend.

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:40.893
Is that what this is?
Are you and Glenn...

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:42.928
Is that why? Is that
what the fuck is going on?

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:44.129
In a way, yes.

01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:45.597
In a way,
what the fuck does that mean?

01:21:45.599 --> 01:21:48.534
I want to be happy.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.202
Hale, years together.

01:21:51.204 --> 01:21:53.205
All I get is
a, "I want to be happy"?

01:21:53.207 --> 01:21:54.839
- You don't listen.
- Vagaries bullshit?

01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:57.308
- Are you leaving me for him?
- No!

01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:58.343
No, whatever this is,

01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:00.245
this is the worst version
of you.

01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:02.617
Do something else.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.686
Look, I'm sorry.

01:22:07.688 --> 01:22:10.555
I went t-today to the place.
I went.

01:22:10.557 --> 01:22:13.558
I made an appointment
for Thursday.

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.961
I want us to do it.
I want...

01:22:16.963 --> 01:22:20.165
I want to have a baby.

01:22:20.167 --> 01:22:21.900
No.

01:22:21.902 --> 01:22:23.634
What do you mean?

01:22:23.636 --> 01:22:24.803
You don't want
to have a baby?

01:22:24.805 --> 01:22:28.205
Yes,
I want to have a baby.

01:22:28.207 --> 01:22:29.240
But not with you.

01:22:29.242 --> 01:22:31.677
- Why not?
- Because you don't want it.

01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:33.711
What the fuck difference
does that make?

01:22:33.713 --> 01:22:36.315
- You never wanted one.
- I want one now.

01:22:36.317 --> 01:22:38.250
This is not fair.
You decided this.

01:22:38.252 --> 01:22:39.384
You made this decision
by yourself,

01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:41.218
and now I have
no fucking say in it!

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.623
I don't know what to do!

01:22:48.996 --> 01:22:50.998
You can't account for growth,
Reece.

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:09.781
Thank you.

01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:20.291
Hey.

01:23:20.293 --> 01:23:22.760
What?

01:23:22.762 --> 01:23:24.095
What are you doing here?

01:23:24.097 --> 01:23:28.000
Um...

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.334
if you want us to do
more work for you,

01:23:29.336 --> 01:23:30.201
that's...
that's fine.

01:23:30.203 --> 01:23:32.403
That's great.
Thank you.

01:23:32.405 --> 01:23:36.610
Um... that'll be
the extent of it.

01:23:37.711 --> 01:23:39.210
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:23:39.212 --> 01:23:40.379
- That's fine.
- Okay.

01:23:40.381 --> 01:23:43.415
I just wanted
to, you know, face to face.

01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:47.318
Yeah.
That's sweet.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.356
That's...

01:23:51.358 --> 01:23:53.290
That's very sweet.

01:23:53.292 --> 01:23:55.794
All right.
You look great.

01:23:55.796 --> 01:23:58.966
Thanks.
Well...

01:24:00.768 --> 01:24:06.039
Hey, uh... Anna,
she's really beautiful.

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:11.410
Yeah.

01:24:11.412 --> 01:24:14.845
Yeah.
She's perfect.

01:24:28.695 --> 01:24:30.831
Who was that?

01:24:31.864 --> 01:24:35.333
Did I say you could
leave the room?

01:24:35.335 --> 01:24:36.968
Get back in there.

01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:37.869
You gonna punish me?

01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:39.003
Yeah,
I'm gonna make you weep.

01:24:39.005 --> 01:24:40.370
I'm gonna crush you
like a little grape.

01:24:40.372 --> 01:24:44.476
- All right. Yeah, all right.
- Shh! No more talking.

01:24:47.014 --> 01:24:50.882
Anna, you are my whole life,
you are my everything,

01:24:50.884 --> 01:24:56.388
and I want us
to be together forever.

01:25:18.011 --> 01:25:20.178
Same again.
Thank you.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.280
I'm excited I get to have
a whole nother bottle.

01:25:22.282 --> 01:25:24.185
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

01:25:27.488 --> 01:25:29.321
What?
Hmm?

01:25:29.323 --> 01:25:30.455
Oh, nothing.

01:25:30.457 --> 01:25:34.392
I was just thinking
about that trip.

01:25:34.394 --> 01:25:35.393
What trip?

01:25:35.395 --> 01:25:37.829
You know, the trip.

01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:39.430
You wanted to go
on a trip.

01:25:39.432 --> 01:25:40.799
Oh, okay.
Well, yeah, sure.

01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:43.434
But don't you want to wait
until the house is finished?

01:25:43.436 --> 01:25:45.903
Yeah. Right.
Right. Absolutely.

01:25:45.905 --> 01:25:47.805
No, totally.
We probably should.

01:25:47.807 --> 01:25:49.473
You know, um...

01:25:49.475 --> 01:25:50.909
Oops.
Wrong pocket.

01:25:55.548 --> 01:25:56.882
- It's for you.
- Wait, is that...

01:25:56.884 --> 01:25:57.750
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you...

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.116
- It's for you.
- Seriously?

01:25:59.118 --> 01:26:00.451
Yes.

01:26:00.453 --> 01:26:01.553
You mean you finished
the house?

01:26:01.555 --> 01:26:04.421
Mm-hmm. So now
can we go on that trip?

01:26:05.859 --> 01:26:08.393
No way!
I don't believe it.

01:26:08.395 --> 01:26:10.461
Let's go.

01:26:10.463 --> 01:26:12.667
Come on.
I want to see it.

01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:20.571
What is it?
Open it.

01:26:20.573 --> 01:26:23.875
Open it.
Gonna open it?

01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:25.343
All right.
I'll open it.

01:26:27.314 --> 01:26:29.013
It's a ring.

01:26:29.015 --> 01:26:30.080
Yes.

01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:36.254
I don't want
to be with anyone else.

01:26:36.256 --> 01:26:39.223
I know that now, okay?

01:26:39.225 --> 01:26:42.827
I...

01:26:42.829 --> 01:26:44.830
I don't know who I am
without you, Anna,

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:48.967
and you're my whole life.

01:26:48.969 --> 01:26:52.102
It's starts with you.
Can't not be you.

01:26:52.104 --> 01:26:56.374
So uh,
will you...

01:26:56.376 --> 01:26:58.476
I should, you know...

01:27:01.347 --> 01:27:02.513
Will you marry me?

01:27:10.957 --> 01:27:13.157
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

01:27:13.159 --> 01:27:15.125
- Yes.
- Good... Good answer. Good answer.

01:27:15.127 --> 01:27:17.394
Of course I'll marry you.
I'll marry you.

01:27:17.396 --> 01:27:19.397
Just get up.

01:27:31.144 --> 01:27:32.910
I bet your mother
wore it well.

01:27:32.912 --> 01:27:35.348
Well, now it's yours.

01:27:39.453 --> 01:27:43.420
Here it is!
Hmm?

01:27:43.422 --> 01:27:46.025
Now wait.
It gets better.

01:27:47.027 --> 01:27:48.460
You're gonna
love this.

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:05.376
Ta-da!

01:28:05.378 --> 01:28:07.912
What do you think?
It's pretty good, right?

01:28:07.914 --> 01:28:08.914
Look at this.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:12.920
This is ours forever.

01:28:18.057 --> 01:28:21.326
- What?
- Why would...

01:28:21.328 --> 01:28:23.460
Why would...

01:28:23.462 --> 01:28:26.099
Why did we do this?

01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:30.936
So we could start
a family?

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:33.039
This is...

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.974
Come on.
You want to...

01:28:36.976 --> 01:28:38.343
You want to come
and take a look?

01:28:38.345 --> 01:28:40.411
What's wrong?

01:28:40.413 --> 01:28:42.246
I can't.

01:28:42.248 --> 01:28:45.016
Can't what, exactly?

01:28:45.018 --> 01:28:46.951
Come on, Anna, will you just
please come inside?

01:28:46.953 --> 01:28:48.053
Please?

01:28:48.055 --> 01:28:50.220
Anna, I built this
for you, for us,

01:28:50.222 --> 01:28:52.958
with my own hands,
okay?

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.026
I need you to look at it.

01:28:55.028 --> 01:28:56.126
Can you just look
at it, please?

01:28:56.128 --> 01:28:57.394
If I go in, I'll stay.

01:28:57.396 --> 01:28:58.495
- Yes.
- Forever.

01:28:58.497 --> 01:28:59.863
Yes, that is what
a house is for.

01:28:59.865 --> 01:29:03.168
I just need to you come inside.
I need you to come inside.

01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:05.105
Will you just get in
the fucking house, please?

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.642
Anna, I just proposed,
and you said yes, okay?

01:29:10.644 --> 01:29:13.344
It's fine.
It's gonna be fine.

01:29:13.346 --> 01:29:14.512
I love you.

01:29:14.514 --> 01:29:15.981
I love you.

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.514
Good, okay.
Let's do this.

01:29:17.516 --> 01:29:18.717
Come on.

01:29:18.719 --> 01:29:20.684
- Will. Will.
- What?

01:29:20.686 --> 01:29:24.858
The house, it's...
it's perfect, but, uh...

01:29:29.029 --> 01:29:31.432
I don't want it.

01:29:37.337 --> 01:29:41.039
Just because
the house is done,

01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:42.674
it... it doesn't mean
that we should get married,

01:29:42.676 --> 01:29:46.745
and it... it doesn't mean
that... that we'll be happy.

01:29:46.747 --> 01:29:50.548
W-W-We'll <i>be</i> happy.
We <i>are</i> happy.

01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:51.715
Right?

01:29:54.488 --> 01:29:58.555
Will, I know I've...
I'm ruining your...

01:29:58.557 --> 01:30:00.258
You've worked so hard

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:03.394
and the house
is beautiful, but...

01:30:03.396 --> 01:30:07.467
Will, we're just...
we're just playing house.

01:30:11.604 --> 01:30:14.073
You don't want me.

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.678
What's wrong with me?

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.216
Hmm?

01:30:26.319 --> 01:30:27.317
Nothing.

01:30:27.319 --> 01:30:29.456
Anna, please.

01:30:33.193 --> 01:30:36.093
"I don't know
who I am without you."

01:30:36.095 --> 01:30:38.197
That's what you said,
right?

01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:41.502
Don't you want to know?

01:30:46.372 --> 01:30:48.572
God.

01:31:02.488 --> 01:31:06.393
We just grew up.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.410
It's beautiful.
