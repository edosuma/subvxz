WEBVTT

01:47.357 --> 01:48.692
No life forms...

01:50.694 --> 01:51.862
and not a lot of water.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.199
Weird place to build a Second Foundation.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.658
Well, you would say that.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.119
Planetfall in four.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.872
So you're saying we have four minutes

02:01.872 --> 02:04.208
to talk about
what we haven't been talking about?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.918
Buckle up. It's gonna be a bumpy EDL.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.085
Salvor.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.086
You told me, all right? You've said it.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.673
Every bad dream you've ever had
has come true.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.843
That doesn't mean that this one will.
I have to believe that we can change this.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.428
But you don't.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.514
You don't believe that.

02:20.557 --> 02:25.521
150 years from now, I die on a battlefield
trying to save humanity.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.190
- It's better than a sickbed.
- You can't just brush this off.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.234
And I guess it means
I won't die any sooner, right?

02:30.234 --> 02:33.153
- I've never felt so alive.
- You could get in a cryo-pod.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.947
Right now, go back to Terminus.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.450
And still end up on the battlefield
at our distant turning point.

02:39.117 --> 02:44.206
After all, there may be infinite ways
to arrive at the inevitable.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.084
<i>Warning, planetary surface thin.</i>

02:47.084 --> 02:48.669
<i>Landing site unstable.</i>

02:48.669 --> 02:50.337
Well, we got no choice, <i>Beggar</i>.

02:52.631 --> 02:56.593
- You're steering?
- Yes. I have control. Brace yourselves.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.720
I'll set us down.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.174
This is Ignis?

03:35.174 --> 03:36.341
Abandoned mines?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.762
We're not on Ignis.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.392
Well, then where the fuck are we?

03:45.392 --> 03:47.895
Oona's World, an imperial mining site,

03:47.895 --> 03:51.064
until its minerals were exhausted
3,000 years ago.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.941
Currently uninhabited.

03:52.941 --> 03:57.237
Hari, you agreed Ignis was crucial
for the Second Foundation.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.406
It is. So is this.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.532
Since when?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.910
Since the Radiant required it.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.703
I know how the math works.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.747
It doesn't design travel itineraries.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.915
It does now.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.793
There's a place in those mountains,
about 500 meters from here,

04:11.793 --> 04:13.462
which it requires me to visit.

04:13.462 --> 04:18.091
Hari, the model is adaptive,
not omniscient.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.928
You wanna go out there,
you can fucking do it alone!

04:20.928 --> 04:24.932
I'm a projection, Gaal,
bound by whatever network is nearest.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.267
I can transfer myself back
into the Radiant,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.603
but I need one of you to carry it for me.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.856
I will not trust you
on something I can't verify.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.692
And I'm not relinquishing control
of the <i>Beggar</i> until this is done.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.361
Just go with him, Gaal.

04:37.361 --> 04:41.782
No. You want me to carry you around
like a rat in a handbag.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.575
- I won't do it, Hari. This--
- Hey!

04:48.747 --> 04:49.748
Do it, Gaal.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.626
Take him with you,
so we can get the fuck out of here.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.505
They were called
the Monuments to Industry.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.216
We're gonna get a rare, close-up look.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.263
- Stay alert while we're gone.
- Why? The planet's uninhabited.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.557
Uninhabited doesn't mean we're alone.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.784
It's unthinkable to incinerate the warden.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.745
- It's barbaric.
- Maybe an error of some kind.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.373
The Vault is a device after all.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.457
No.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.129
The Vault is a man, and it's literally
made out of Hari Seldon.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.756
I told you he wouldn't approve of
what you've done here.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.217
You think this is divine judgment, Claric?

05:42.217 --> 05:44.595
No, but it was a judgment.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.306
Whatever the case,

05:47.306 --> 05:49.933
we don't have time to cry
and clasp our icons.

05:51.018 --> 05:56.148
How could Seldon's math foresee
someone specific, like Hober Mallow,

05:56.148 --> 05:59.818
who could even be born,
much less request his presence?

05:59.818 --> 06:02.237
We don't actually know
the Vault was making a request.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.239
- It could be a warning.
- Right.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.950
The last thing we should do
is allow that blood-poor son of a bitch

06:06.950 --> 06:09.161
- anywhere near the Vault.
- Don't be ridiculous.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.829
Of course we're finding Hober Mallow.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.456
And we're walking him into that Vault.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.083
Psychohistory isn't determinism, Poly.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.545
It's not a single path, but it is
a landscape that sometimes narrows

06:18.545 --> 06:21.632
into a dangerous mountain pass
that can't be avoided.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.218
That's why we call it a crisis.

06:24.218 --> 06:29.806
Seldon knew that in his first crisis
that success would require action.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.018
And the action we took
at that time had a name.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.144
Salvor Hardin.

06:34.144 --> 06:37.773
And if Hari Seldon had engraved the name
Salvor Hardin somewhere at that time,

06:37.773 --> 06:39.024
you'd have a point.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.068
Poly?

06:42.945 --> 06:43.946
No.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.491
So,
you think Hober Mallow is our new action?

06:47.491 --> 06:48.909
Look, I don't know why.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.163
But his name is on the only embodiment
we have right now of Seldon's Plans.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.456
You aren't even a believer.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.124
I believe in psychohistory.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.669
I believe
that the Empire is going to fall.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.172
And if we're smart,
we're the ones to bring it down.

07:03.298 --> 07:07.010
Humans will wallow like beasts
for a very long time,

07:07.010 --> 07:09.388
unless we use what Seldon gave us

07:09.388 --> 07:11.765
and walk through
that blasted mountain pass

07:11.765 --> 07:14.601
with that fucking asshole, Hober Mallow.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.271
Fine.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.022
Hober Mallow?

07:19.815 --> 07:23.026
Never heard that name before.
I wasn't even sure it's a person.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.780
Ask me, Mallow could be
a region of space or a species of nut.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.116
Arguably, he is a species of nut.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.659
He trained for the priesthood,

07:30.659 --> 07:32.911
but he was too much
for the Revered Fathers.

07:32.911 --> 07:37.708
Instead, he trailed my fellow
missionaries like a venereal disease,

07:37.708 --> 07:41.378
selling religious paraphernalia
and fake relics.

07:41.378 --> 07:45.132
He sold 38 of Seldon's finger bones

07:45.132 --> 07:47.968
before Foundation
revoked his trades license.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.887
Why would the Prophet ask
for a man like that?

07:49.887 --> 07:52.264
Seldon always appreciated a good joke.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.099
He was human too, you know?

07:54.725 --> 07:57.895
The Prophet's title was something
that we bestowed on him after.

07:57.895 --> 08:02.107
- So, where are we headed?
- According to my contacts, Korell.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.859
Out on the Whassalian Rift?

08:04.860 --> 08:06.153
Traders aren't even allowed there.

08:06.153 --> 08:10.324
You're talking about a man who views
any prohibition as a personal challenge.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.493
If it's forbidden, Hober traffics in it.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.786
What are they?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.247
Autonomous mining machines.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.458
They sucked the Palladium
from the pores of the planet.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.418
And then,
when there was nothing left of value,

09:03.418 --> 09:05.379
they were turned loose
upon the population.

09:07.422 --> 09:11.093
The Emperors are hollow men
who hollow out their worlds.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.345
How do you know all this?

09:13.345 --> 09:14.888
Why do you know all this?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.307
It's called psychohistory, Gaal.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.394
Hari, I can help you.
You just have to let me in.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.730
I'm the only other person in the galaxy
who can read the Radiant.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.858
Yes, but you're disruptive.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.360
Around and around we go.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.446
We're here at the Radiant's behest.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.200
It's not some detour keeping you
from what you want.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.327
What I want is to slap you.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.371
You tried that already.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.248
I'm talking about Salvor.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.376
You're dangling the prospects of hope.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.295
It's a mistake.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.631
The future you've seen
may very well be immutable.

09:50.132 --> 09:53.010
You were happy to get the word
"Ignis" from my vision and act on it.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.595
Now, if I do it, it's wrong?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.847
Here's the difference,
which you should already grasp.

09:56.847 --> 10:01.310
My Plan makes small changes in the present
to adjust large events in the future.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.271
You want to observe
one very small event in the future,

10:04.271 --> 10:06.565
the death of a specific human being,

10:06.565 --> 10:09.401
and apply massive forces in the present
to avert it.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.321
- Salvor solved your first crisis.
- She had help.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.781
Every historical condition
was on her side.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.950
If it hadn't been her,
it would have been someone else.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.035
Conditions?

10:18.035 --> 10:21.121
You didn't put any psychohistorians
on Terminus.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.333
- And if it wasn't for her ability--
- I intended one psychohistorian

10:24.333 --> 10:25.626
to be on Terminus!

10:26.335 --> 10:27.336
Right?

10:29.338 --> 10:30.506
In another life,

10:31.298 --> 10:34.009
you might have taught your daughter
all about my Vault.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.055
You seem to think
you're very indispensable.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.349
Well, Gaal, it is my Plan.

10:41.475 --> 10:45.145
But no, at enough scale,
I am insignificant.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.125
We weren't always alone in this.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.878
- What?
- You said earlier

11:09.878 --> 11:12.965
that you were the only other person
who could read the Radiant.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.716
That wasn't always the case.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.762
I had a life partner, Yanna.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.306
She helped me birth psychohistory.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.017
You could say it was the only child
we had together.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
The only one that survived anyway.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.149
I wouldn't finish that just yet.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.569
We still have a long way to go.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.904
You said 500 meters.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.031
Horizontally.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.081
I swear, Hari,
this had better be worth it.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.457
It will be.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.169
We're going to meet an old friend.

11:50.169 --> 11:51.253
An old friend?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.771
442, on your feet!

12:53.941 --> 12:55.067
Move it!

13:07.538 --> 13:08.539
No.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.209
713, hands off Prisoner 429.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.045
Just give him a minute.
He'll make the day.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.595
He wasn't being willful.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.849
He had more work left in him.

14:02.926 --> 14:03.927
Bel Riose.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.888
Lady Demerzel.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.056
I'm here with an offer.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.726
Empire needs the Hero of the 20th Fleet.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.227
There are battles to be fought.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.565
- Where?
- The Periphery.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.193
You'll start on Siwenna,
in the Normannic Sector.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.944
A new enemy has risen.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.863
Siwenna's a backwater dump.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.365
That's coming from someone who lives here.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.118
Complete the mission and go free.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.580
Why so generous?

14:31.580 --> 14:35.083
- Day had a notion you might refuse.
- Yeah. He's not wrong.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.587
His leadership is capricious and unwise.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.965
That puts you in a position
of strength then, doesn't it?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.635
Their freedom too.

14:46.011 --> 14:50.015
And just to be clear,
that's not my price to go with ya.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.061
It's my price to enter
into a conversation about it.

14:54.061 --> 14:58.023
You were sent to Lepsis because you
insisted on a safer path for your sailors.

14:58.774 --> 15:01.193
Do you wish to remain here
for a similar mistake?

15:01.193 --> 15:03.779
Freedom for them.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.113
Not freedom.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.912
Longer breaks. Better equipment.
Medical care.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.169
Fine.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.966
And now, we negotiate if I return or not.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.886
I'd need free rein.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.806
No countermanding from Empire.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.641
That was already the plan.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.393
Follow me.

15:34.393 --> 15:40.065
Tell Empire he can go fuck himself
in his big, blue fucking dress.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.112
I have an order to carry out
if you say no.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.198
I ain't afraid to die.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.450
That's why we want you.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.414
And I have a way to make it worthwhile
to say yes.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.834
Glawen Curr.

16:05.632 --> 16:12.347
Empire executed my husband six years ago.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.933
You were told he was executed.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.727
It was part of the punishment.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.524
I don't believe you.

16:23.609 --> 16:24.985
Empire will brief you.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.613
If all goes well,
you will see your husband.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.873
I know hope is painful.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.250
You don't have to hope.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.211
Just come with me.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.839
Our destination must be
on the other side of this door.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.760
Traditionally, doors have hinges
and maybe a knob.

17:32.636 --> 17:33.971
This is a wall.

17:33.971 --> 17:36.306
Open a wall, it becomes a door.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.388
I do hope the trek on the sand

18:58.388 --> 19:01.016
wasn't harder than you were prepared
to endure.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.809
I know your face.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.812
I've seen depictions
and I know that meter.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.024
You're Kalle, but--

19:10.359 --> 19:12.694
You died centuries ago. How are you alive?

19:12.694 --> 19:15.531
You can ask what that means
when we meet up again.

19:17.032 --> 19:20.202
If the future allows us to meet up again.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.120
You should go back.

19:22.996 --> 19:23.997
I don't understand.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.124
You said you couldn't venture
far from the Radiant.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.253
I have the means to sustain
a pure digital form.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.756
- He'll persist.
- Persist? What?

19:32.756 --> 19:37.135
I don't know what's going to happen next.
So perhaps we should say goodbye.

19:37.135 --> 19:41.390
If you don't hear from me
within six hours, leave.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.309
I've already transferred control
of the <i>Beggar</i> back to Salvor.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.936
Wait, don't leave!

19:48.105 --> 19:49.106
Fuck!

20:15.174 --> 20:17.217
Offered for consideration.

20:18.177 --> 20:20.429
Master Trader Ponyets is ready
when you are, sir.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.103
Open communications.

20:37.946 --> 20:42.075
Commdor Argo, honor be on you.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.243
And thank you.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.329
<i>Thank you for seeing me.</i>

20:45.329 --> 20:48.498
Ponyets, we've been warned of your kind.

20:49.249 --> 20:53.837
My people will take no commerce that
carries with it a compulsory religion.

20:53.837 --> 20:57.341
<i>No, I'm a Master Trader.
Money is my religion and</i>--

20:59.176 --> 21:00.344
<i>Commdor?</i>

21:00.844 --> 21:01.929
<i>One moment.</i>

21:03.639 --> 21:05.265
That's not Trader Ponyets.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.727
That's Hober Mallow,
a notorious confidence man.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.566
Forcer, I am aware he is trying
to sell me a useless device.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.277
Undoubtedly for half our treasury.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.280
I'm going to lure him in
and expose him as a cheat.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.366
I know what I'm doing.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.619
<i>Did your Forcer say I was a cheat?</i>

21:26.453 --> 21:29.039
<i>Yeah, she's right. All traders are cheats.</i>

21:29.039 --> 21:33.877
But, Your Esteem, even a cheat
can stumble across a miracle.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.129
You're as bold as brass, Ponyets.

21:37.005 --> 21:37.923
Very well.

21:37.923 --> 21:40.175
<i>Demonstrate your miracle.</i>

21:40.175 --> 21:43.220
It is called a castling device.

21:43.220 --> 21:48.976
And I am confident it'll earn its place
next to the Eye of Korell in your heart.

21:53.647 --> 21:54.940
Looks fairly ordinary.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.442
We've never heard of "castling."

21:57.442 --> 21:59.111
<i>Except in chess, of course.</i>

21:59.820 --> 22:01.071
Very astute.

22:01.071 --> 22:06.618
Yes, it is named after the chess maneuver
in which a king and a rook trade places.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.621
<i>A scientist
working in quantum entanglement</i>

22:09.621 --> 22:11.206
<i>stumbled across a mechanism</i>

22:11.206 --> 22:15.169
that can move a living being
over a great distance,

22:15.169 --> 22:17.880
as long as there's a body
of approximately equal mass

22:17.880 --> 22:19.381
to make the reciprocal journey.

22:19.381 --> 22:23.135
And you came to possess this, how?

22:23.135 --> 22:27.347
The scientist refused
to hand the plans over to Empire.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.433
She feared what would be done with it.

22:30.475 --> 22:34.229
You know,
moving deadly troops into civilian areas.

22:34.229 --> 22:37.941
<i>Sewing bombs into prisoners
and then transporting them</i>

22:37.941 --> 22:39.693
<i>into the middle of a demonstration.</i>

22:41.403 --> 22:43.071
- It's very bad.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

22:43.071 --> 22:45.699
I trust a principled ruler,

22:45.699 --> 22:47.701
such as yourself,
would use it more justly.

22:47.701 --> 22:48.994
<i>But is it safe?</i>

22:48.994 --> 22:51.955
You see, on Korell,
we've heard gruesome stories

22:51.955 --> 22:55.083
of men porting across planets
collapsing in agony.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.212
<i>No. No worries, Commdor, okay?</i>

22:58.212 --> 23:03.884
<i>Everything contained
in the body's bioelectrical field,</i>

23:04.468 --> 23:05.511
<i>travels along.</i>

23:05.511 --> 23:08.722
So it's just stuff outside the body
that's left behind.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.974
Clothes and such.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.227
You mean arriving naked?

23:13.227 --> 23:15.604
No, not naked.

23:15.604 --> 23:21.401
The Castler jumps
into the clothes of the other person.

23:21.944 --> 23:22.986
I see.

23:22.986 --> 23:26.782
Naturally, I have the control bracelet

23:27.449 --> 23:30.410
and an assistant
on the airwalk outside my ship

23:30.410 --> 23:31.828
has a bracelet just like yours.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.872
That could be faked.

23:33.872 --> 23:34.957
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:34.957 --> 23:37.835
<i>Anything can be faked,
unless it happens to you.</i>

23:37.835 --> 23:41.755
Well, you bothered to send a bracelet,
so use it.

23:42.631 --> 23:43.465
Sorry, what? I--

23:43.465 --> 23:45.759
You reassured us of its safety...

23:48.053 --> 23:50.222
- so castle me.
- <i>No-- But, no. I can't.</i>

23:50.222 --> 23:53.934
There's rules against royalty
and commoners intermingling.

23:53.934 --> 23:58.480
<i>So I absolve you of them. Do it,
or I shall have your head on a pike.</i>

23:58.480 --> 23:59.690
If you insist.

24:09.283 --> 24:12.411
<i>Citizens of Korell, it's an honor.</i>

24:18.458 --> 24:19.585
How much do you want for it?

24:19.585 --> 24:21.712
<i>Yeah, it's too late. I've changed my mind.</i>

24:23.255 --> 24:24.131
Forcer.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.134
He has the Eye of Korell!

24:35.517 --> 24:37.060
Oh, shit.

24:43.525 --> 24:46.069
Hober Mallow, you're under arrest.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.290
You contain diamonds, Mallow.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.876
Yeah. To be in my bioelectrical field.

25:01.877 --> 25:03.879
Hey. Careful with that.

25:03.879 --> 25:05.297
That is a rare vintage.

25:05.297 --> 25:06.381
Get the device off him.

25:07.466 --> 25:08.342
Allow me.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.433
I want that wine back after the trial.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.227
There's no trial.

25:19.228 --> 25:21.563
Commdor Argo's already ordered
your execution.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.753
I'll escort you to Empire
when you feel that you are presentable.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.682
No.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.398
I wanna face Day like this.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.733
This is the man he made me.

26:12.781 --> 26:15.450
Thank you, Empire.

26:16.243 --> 26:19.037
I'm grateful to no longer be on Lepsis.

26:19.037 --> 26:21.248
Yes, I can smell the gratitude.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.460
You're here by Lady Demerzel's grace,
not mine.

26:25.460 --> 26:29.298
The transport that brought you here
can just as easily bring you back.

26:30.799 --> 26:33.260
Lady Demerzel said
that Glawen is still alive.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.054
- Glawen...
- Don't play games.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.890
He waits behind that door.

26:37.890 --> 26:40.058
You'll see him after we talk.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.477
If our talk goes well,
you'll find him alive.

26:43.562 --> 26:45.480
- What's the mission?
- Reconnaissance.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.317
- We have an informant on Siwenna.
- That's a spy's work.

26:48.317 --> 26:50.068
Siwenna's not a military threat.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.405
Not unless they're weaponizing cacti.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.532
So, who's your actual concern?

26:55.532 --> 26:59.161
Over a hundred years ago,
Hari Seldon stood where you are now.

27:00.078 --> 27:02.664
He claimed he could establish a Foundation

27:02.664 --> 27:06.126
to read the future and shorten
a coming age of darkness.

27:06.126 --> 27:10.881
Now I believe it was simply a ruse
to buy his people time and distance.

27:10.881 --> 27:13.383
Currently,
his followers worship his memory

27:13.383 --> 27:16.428
and recruit members
from the fringes of Empire.

27:17.179 --> 27:21.600
I want you to find out
if the Foundation is a threat to me.

27:25.145 --> 27:26.355
Can they read the future?

27:26.355 --> 27:29.983
That would fall under the heading
of, "Things you're supposed to find out."

27:30.859 --> 27:32.778
Forced labor has diminished him.

27:33.904 --> 27:35.155
Take him away.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.782
Kill the husband.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.578
Can I speak frankly, Empire?

27:43.413 --> 27:44.748
And privately.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.084
Just the two of us?

27:50.754 --> 27:52.214
Granted.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.684
Brothers.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.529
- Speak.
- You're an arrogant bully.

28:17.990 --> 28:22.703
If you brought me here just to kill me,
then you're an idiot as well.

28:22.703 --> 28:26.415
When you defied my orders in battle,
you embarrassed me.

28:27.624 --> 28:30.043
A man can withstand that,
but not an empire.

28:31.086 --> 28:35.591
An empire breathes respect.
It requires it for its life.

28:37.593 --> 28:40.262
It also requires planetary systems.

28:41.889 --> 28:45.017
And if this Foundation is picking 'em off,

28:45.767 --> 28:49.438
then you need the fleet
with the highest efficiency rating.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.607
The 20th Fleet isn't yours anymore.

28:53.483 --> 28:54.693
Fuck if it isn't.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.155
And this isn't about respect
for bloody Empire.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.742
I made you look foolish, didn't I?

29:02.784 --> 29:03.785
You.

29:03.785 --> 29:07.873
The singular man in that suit of skin

29:07.873 --> 29:10.542
that's never come within
a light-year of a battle.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.836
- Do you think to strike me?
- Strike ya?

29:13.629 --> 29:15.380
I'd like to rip your fucking head off.

29:16.757 --> 29:20.177
- Go ahead!
- I took an oath, you're my Emperor.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.847
- Strike me.
- No.

29:23.847 --> 29:26.642
- Strike me or I kill your husband.
- Another game?

29:26.642 --> 29:29.102
What answer am I looking for?
Do I want you to strike me

29:29.102 --> 29:31.772
so I know I can control you
by threatening your husband,

29:31.772 --> 29:36.193
or do I want you to refrain, to show
that you will protect Empire at all cost?

29:36.193 --> 29:38.987
One of these choices buys you everything.

29:39.571 --> 29:42.491
One sends you back to the mines a widower.

29:42.491 --> 29:43.909
I took an oath.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.746
I'll not strike my Emperor.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.666
Not even for Glawen's life?

29:52.668 --> 29:55.337
I've had a dead husband
for the last six years.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.168
Glawen?

30:34.710 --> 30:35.711
Yes?

30:41.508 --> 30:42.885
It's me.

30:55.856 --> 30:57.024
Bel?

31:00.485 --> 31:01.695
They brought me here--

31:04.114 --> 31:05.199
I thought it meant you died.

31:05.782 --> 31:06.992
They told me...

31:09.661 --> 31:11.371
They told me you had died.

31:12.748 --> 31:15.459
- Six years ago.
- Bel, I tried to get a message out to you.

31:15.459 --> 31:18.587
- They said they'd kill you if I tried.
- It's all right.

31:18.587 --> 31:20.506
It's all right, Glay.

31:20.506 --> 31:22.341
Those fucking cruel bastards.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.135
Watch your words.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.430
We're back in their service now.

31:29.890 --> 31:31.767
Not to mention their palace.

31:31.767 --> 31:32.976
In service?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.106
That hair is not regulation.

31:54.915 --> 31:56.041
No, I--

31:57.709 --> 32:00.796
I'm still 713.

32:02.631 --> 32:03.674
I'm filthy.

32:04.675 --> 32:06.009
My teeth--

32:09.638 --> 32:10.764
I've got lice.

32:54.725 --> 32:55.726
It's okay.

33:14.786 --> 33:15.954
Hey.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.799
I'm so sorry.

33:45.901 --> 33:46.902
There you are.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.571
Yeah.

33:51.657 --> 33:52.658
That's me.

34:02.668 --> 34:04.711
So that was the right answer?

34:05.295 --> 34:06.421
I don't know.

34:08.090 --> 34:11.592
I looked into his eyes,
and he seemed like a strong person.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.889
There we go.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.476
You wanted someone who wouldn't vacillate.

34:20.268 --> 34:25.107
Someone who will make a choice
and assert it. That's a good policy.

34:25.690 --> 34:31.071
I let go of good policy
or genetic sense memory of good policy.

34:35.242 --> 34:37.286
Do you know how lucky we are to have you?

34:38.078 --> 34:39.204
You're fine.

34:40.873 --> 34:42.331
You're doing well.

34:44.376 --> 34:45.960
You are Empire.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.922
Keep going.

35:17.868 --> 35:20.078
<i>I'm telling you, she felt alive.</i>

35:22.039 --> 35:25.167
But Kalle,
the real one died centuries ago.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.837
I have no idea
what's in that cave with him.

35:29.796 --> 35:30.964
Something is off.

35:31.965 --> 35:33.300
This whole planet is wrong.

35:34.468 --> 35:36.053
Six hours is almost up.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.055
Then we'll leave him behind.

35:38.555 --> 35:39.765
We have every reason to.

35:41.558 --> 35:42.559
I know we do.

35:44.520 --> 35:47.940
He's not Hari. He's a digital simulacrum.

35:48.607 --> 35:50.567
And he was trapped
for over a hundred years.

35:50.567 --> 35:53.153
Even he said that kind of isolation
can drive someone mad.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.697
It's not me that needs convincing.

35:57.741 --> 36:01.370
Look, whatever version of Hari this is...

36:03.789 --> 36:04.998
he scares me.

36:07.543 --> 36:08.961
And the two of you together...

36:11.296 --> 36:15.467
Gaal, he almost suffocated you.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.553
And you encouraged it.

36:19.304 --> 36:23.934
So if you say, "Fly us out of here,"
I will take us right up.

36:26.270 --> 36:27.271
But?

36:28.105 --> 36:30.566
But I don't think you want that.

36:37.114 --> 36:39.074
You and him, you got your own language.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.161
I don't speak it.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.043
Look, all I'm saying is...

36:52.421 --> 36:54.464
you're more like him
than you want to admit.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.177
Maybe you're right.

37:00.304 --> 37:01.722
He was my idol.

37:03.182 --> 37:05.642
Father figure I convinced myself I needed.

37:06.977 --> 37:08.979
Yeah, that's the thing with parents,
isn't it?

37:08.979 --> 37:11.106
Never quite who you build them up to be.

37:17.112 --> 37:18.405
My dad used to say...

37:20.532 --> 37:24.578
"Never let your sense of morals
prevent you from doing what's right."

37:25.871 --> 37:27.456
So just ask yourself, Gaal,

37:28.081 --> 37:32.002
if the situation were reversed,
what would Hari do now?

37:40.093 --> 37:41.303
He'd fucking leave.

38:03.909 --> 38:06.328
Wonder what's going on?
Some kind of celebration?

38:06.328 --> 38:12.125
First prisoner death by Titan's prick.

38:12.668 --> 38:14.711
Go!

38:16.672 --> 38:20.467
Yeah!

38:23.887 --> 38:25.514
Bring the next one!

38:25.514 --> 38:27.015
Second prisoner.

38:29.810 --> 38:30.811
- Hober Mallow.
- Boo!

38:30.811 --> 38:32.354
- Boo!
- Fuck, no!

38:32.354 --> 38:35.065
Death by Titan's prick!

38:35.649 --> 38:37.192
Hober Mallow!

38:39.278 --> 38:41.029
- Hober!
- Hello.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.614
Yeah!

38:42.614 --> 38:44.032
I'm rather busy right now.

38:44.032 --> 38:49.162
Shut up, you ass. We've come to free you.
The Foundation needs you.

38:49.162 --> 38:52.583
The Vault opened yesterday,
it requested your presence.

38:52.583 --> 38:55.669
Poly Verisof,
I've never met a man with worse timing!

38:59.298 --> 39:00.299
Forcer Wallick.

39:01.425 --> 39:04.094
I hate to dampen your enthusiasm,
but apparently,

39:04.094 --> 39:06.180
something's come up
and the Foundation needs me.

39:06.180 --> 39:08.599
So, if you could just not execute me?

39:10.559 --> 39:11.685
Not listening, Poly.

39:12.853 --> 39:15.606
You with the Claric? Hilarious, isn't he?

39:16.356 --> 39:19.610
Stories I could tell you
if my capital wasn't about to be punished.

39:24.323 --> 39:25.908
Forcer Wallick, is this your design?

39:26.491 --> 39:28.577
Very efficient. Cozy.

39:32.998 --> 39:33.999
Your Esteem,

39:34.666 --> 39:38.837
I ask that you allow me
to meet with Hober in private,

39:39.379 --> 39:43.133
before he faces the prospect
of going unprepared

39:43.133 --> 39:45.969
into the bosom of
the great Galactic Spirit.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.140
You are a tender of the soul?

39:50.140 --> 39:52.559
One of the Foundation's so-called Clarics?

39:52.559 --> 39:54.937
I have been so trained.

39:56.939 --> 40:02.236
Every man should prepare his soul before
journeying to the ancestral spirits.

40:02.236 --> 40:07.866
Alas, you will have
to prepare Hober's posthumously.

40:07.866 --> 40:10.702
- Death by Titan's prick!
- No, no!

40:14.831 --> 40:17.000
Stop this at once, damn it!

40:17.000 --> 40:19.545
In the name of the Galactic Spirit,
we submit ourselves.

40:23.423 --> 40:28.178
Your Esteem, death is so irrevocable
a phenomenon. Surely--

40:28.929 --> 40:31.056
Come on, there must be an alternative?

40:31.056 --> 40:33.350
Alas, no.

40:37.980 --> 40:41.733
But thank you for the parting gifts,
Master Trader.

40:43.652 --> 40:45.904
I shall enjoy the wine this evening.

40:45.904 --> 40:47.698
Say your last words, fool.

40:48.282 --> 40:49.867
Citizens of Korell,

40:51.410 --> 40:58.125
I was born of modest means,
and I faced many obstacles in my life.

40:59.334 --> 41:05.090
I suppose it's not the past I should
dwell on, but the future I'll be denied.

41:06.258 --> 41:08.844
The acts of charity I'll never carry out.

41:10.345 --> 41:11.513
The strangers...

41:13.932 --> 41:15.184
I'll never meet.

41:15.184 --> 41:19.646
Enemies I might have charmed into friends.

41:21.148 --> 41:23.942
But it's not to be.

41:24.526 --> 41:28.322
I played my game too boldly
and I see that now.

41:30.699 --> 41:36.038
And here I am, I have no move
that will not put me in check.

41:36.038 --> 41:37.080
- Enough!
- And I--

41:37.080 --> 41:39.082
Drop the prick on him!

41:39.583 --> 41:41.877
Well, actually, I hadn't finished.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.213
I hadn't finished! I've just wa--

41:56.099 --> 41:59.019
Hey! Fuck is going on?

41:59.019 --> 42:02.356
Fucking get me out of here.
I am not Hober Mallow.

42:02.356 --> 42:04.858
It's the Commdor! Stop the prick!

42:06.443 --> 42:08.612
Hober Mallow, you fuck!

42:13.825 --> 42:15.953
Sleight of hand, Your Esteem.

42:15.953 --> 42:19.540
It was this node, not the bracelet,
that did the switch.

42:19.540 --> 42:22.626
- Poly, always a pleasure.
- Well, stop him!

42:27.089 --> 42:29.132
Wow. He's very confident.

42:29.925 --> 42:31.176
He's appalling.

42:31.885 --> 42:34.429
- How far can he get on an air yacht?
- Alert the spaceports!

42:34.429 --> 42:37.474
He knows that we've got a jumpship.
He's gonna take it!

42:38.350 --> 42:40.102
He's gonna take the <i>Spirit</i>!

42:56.827 --> 42:59.329
Come on, up! Up!

43:00.163 --> 43:01.415
Constant!

43:21.101 --> 43:24.146
Welcome. Exciting, isn't it?
I'm gonna need your personal access codes.

43:24.146 --> 43:27.149
We're not jumping to whatever
lawless zone you set your coordinates to.

43:27.149 --> 43:29.401
What? You'd rather they shoot us down?
You're better off jumping--

43:30.402 --> 43:31.612
Keep him away from me.

43:33.739 --> 43:34.740
Hello.

43:34.740 --> 43:36.241
Drop me off on the nearest asteroid.

43:36.241 --> 43:38.911
- We need you on Terminus.
- I'm not going to Terminus.

43:40.370 --> 43:43.457
Would you keep her quiet?
I'm trying to pilot.

43:50.547 --> 43:51.882
You're not taking the escape pod.

43:51.882 --> 43:54.426
Look, if you think I won't hurt you
because you're a woman, I will--

43:55.135 --> 43:57.179
What is that? You stabbing me,
is that supposed--

44:00.015 --> 44:01.475
What was--

44:03.310 --> 44:04.311
That's it.

44:05.854 --> 44:07.022
Get it all out.

44:24.039 --> 44:25.749
You got everything you wanted.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.045
We could disappear.

44:34.049 --> 44:36.343
Empire has been monstrous to you, Bel.

44:37.719 --> 44:39.096
He's been monstrous to me.

44:39.096 --> 44:40.973
That's why we can't just run.

44:40.973 --> 44:44.434
A weak Emperor needs a strong general.

44:44.434 --> 44:46.144
And he'll be fearful of that general.

44:47.062 --> 44:48.814
He'll always be imagining a coup.

44:48.814 --> 44:52.025
He didn't imprison you
because of some order you disobeyed,

44:52.025 --> 44:53.902
he did it because you are loved.

44:53.902 --> 44:55.028
It's immaterial.

44:56.071 --> 45:01.034
I'm not a revolutionary, Glawen,
any more than I am a deserter.

45:03.620 --> 45:06.707
The Emperor's subjects, all these
trillions of people, they're just--

45:07.916 --> 45:09.543
they're disposable to him.

45:11.753 --> 45:16.008
So, as the one man who isn't,
it's my duty to protect them, Glay.

45:17.217 --> 45:18.844
- All of them.
- Right now?

45:20.262 --> 45:22.181
Bel, you need time to recover.

45:22.681 --> 45:26.727
And we need time to find each other again.

45:28.228 --> 45:30.230
I'll be by your side, no matter what.

45:30.230 --> 45:31.356
But I tell you,

45:32.774 --> 45:37.029
being under Empire's heel leaves a mark.

45:38.030 --> 45:39.948
And that doesn't go away
when the heel is lifted.

45:39.948 --> 45:42.326
So, you're gonna be at my side
every minute, are you?

45:42.910 --> 45:44.620
Looking for the tread marks on my face.

45:46.288 --> 45:47.664
They're not on your face.

45:54.713 --> 45:57.883
<i>Approaching Destiny.
Prepare the cabin for docking.</i>

46:00.636 --> 46:01.637
The point remains.

46:03.430 --> 46:05.390
With this Day in charge,

46:06.433 --> 46:08.143
for the sake of all these people,

46:09.770 --> 46:12.105
I don't have the luxury
of settling the score.

46:13.941 --> 46:20.155
I was prepared for you to say that,
which is why I kept this for you.

46:25.077 --> 46:26.245
General.

47:22.968 --> 47:23.969
At ease.

47:28.390 --> 47:30.058
Welcome home, General Riose.

47:30.058 --> 47:32.186
It's good to be back, She-Bends-Light.

47:37.107 --> 47:39.109
I hope,
during your years under gravity's boot,

47:39.109 --> 47:40.986
you haven't forgotten how to space-fold.

47:42.237 --> 47:44.907
We didn't pack any sick bags
for this journey.

47:47.284 --> 47:50.204
- Missed your humor, She-Bends.
- And I your smile, General.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.873
All those years opalesk mining,

47:52.873 --> 47:55.918
and you still only brought me
remnants under your fingernails.

47:57.252 --> 47:58.837
I'm teasing, General.

47:59.463 --> 48:02.466
Empire couldn't control my kind
if they didn't keep a stranglehold on it.

48:03.634 --> 48:05.427
Set a course for the Outer Reach.

48:13.727 --> 48:15.395
It's not too late to belay that.

48:16.355 --> 48:17.773
Jump locked in.

48:18.524 --> 48:19.608
Too late now.

48:20.484 --> 48:22.236
All hands to jump creches.

48:46.426 --> 48:49.471
Fine. We'll build a Second Foundation
without Hari.

48:51.765 --> 48:53.183
Takeoff might be a little rough.

49:05.946 --> 49:07.990
<i>Warning. Planetary surface thin.</i>

49:07.990 --> 49:09.449
- You all right?
- Yeah.

49:09.449 --> 49:11.910
- <i>Landing site unstable.</i>
- Yeah, thanks.

49:11.910 --> 49:13.161
It's all right. We'll just--

49:17.541 --> 49:19.042
Oh, shit.

49:20.794 --> 49:22.629
Uninhabited doesn't mean alone.

49:32.055 --> 49:34.933
- Get us out of here! Fly us out!
- Yes, I'm trying, I'm trying!

49:46.195 --> 49:47.738
Watch out!

49:52.868 --> 49:54.369
Come on.

49:54.369 --> 49:55.954
Nearly there.

50:10.052 --> 50:11.762
What the hell were those?

50:12.888 --> 50:13.889
Did we lose 'em?

50:13.889 --> 50:17.768
No. They just turned around. It's like
they got a scent of something else.

50:19.561 --> 50:22.022
Not possible.
There's nothing alive on this rock but us.

50:30.364 --> 50:31.365
Wait.

50:33.534 --> 50:36.620
Probes are picking up activity
in those monuments.

50:36.620 --> 50:37.704
What?

50:38.288 --> 50:39.289
A life-form.

50:39.790 --> 50:41.834
Maybe that Kalle person was alive.

50:42.417 --> 50:44.086
There's something breathing down there.

50:48.131 --> 50:49.383
It's Hari.

50:49.383 --> 50:50.843
What? No, it can't be Hari.

50:50.843 --> 50:53.595
I'm telling you, it's him. It's Hari.

50:55.848 --> 50:56.932
Turn.

50:56.932 --> 50:58.225
There's nowhere to land.

50:58.225 --> 50:59.977
Bring us down onto the hand.

51:25.711 --> 51:27.087
Open the air lock.

51:49.651 --> 51:51.278
You have to fly closer!

52:02.164 --> 52:03.665
I've got a pulse, Salvor.

52:03.665 --> 52:04.875
<i>He's real. He's alive.</i>

52:09.296 --> 52:10.672
What are you?

52:24.353 --> 52:27.356
Gaal, hurry. Those things are gonna
take down the entire mountain.

52:36.573 --> 52:38.075
You have to wake up.

52:42.663 --> 52:44.957
Salvor, pull us up!

52:44.957 --> 52:46.625
Hang on!

53:00.973 --> 53:03.225
Hari, wake up. Come on.

53:03.225 --> 53:04.309
Wake up.

53:08.730 --> 53:12.067
How do you have a body?
How is this possible?

53:14.278 --> 53:15.279
I don't know.
