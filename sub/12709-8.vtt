WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:03.471
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.907
I'm just a guy
with his ear to the ground,
but even I can feel it.

00:06.939 --> 00:11.311
Something's coming.
 I don't know what exactly,
 but something's brewing.

00:11.345 --> 00:15.816
It's so big, ugly and damned,
 it makes you and me look
 like little big puzzle pieces.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.518
You're gonna live
in that small room over there.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.553
I know it looks like a closet,
but it's a room now.

00:19.586 --> 00:23.556
And I hate this plan. I just
don't understand when his
problems became your problems.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.260
The school basement
is making him crazy.
We can't just leave him there.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.495
Things are different now.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.330
He has a soul.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.100
Mom?

00:35.735 --> 00:40.039
DAWN: Get off her,
 and let her talk to me.

00:40.073 --> 00:44.445
Things are coming, Dawn.
When it's bad,
Buffy won't choose you.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.412
No!

00:45.445 --> 00:47.615
You don't know hurt.

00:47.648 --> 00:51.351
This last year is gonna seem
like cake after what I put you
and your friends through,

00:51.384 --> 00:54.088
and I am not a fan
 of easy death.

00:54.121 --> 00:57.225
Fact is, the whole good
 versus evil balancing
 the scales thing?

00:57.258 --> 01:02.695
I'm over it.
But believe me,
I'm going for a big finish.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.930
(snarling)

01:05.063 --> 01:08.301
"From beneath you,
it devours."

01:08.335 --> 01:11.772
Wha-- what do you mean?
How do you know Spike?

01:11.805 --> 01:15.575
What do you mean, how?
He was the guy that, um--
Oh, what's the word?

01:15.608 --> 01:19.579
Sired.
Yeah. He was the guy
that sired me.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.454
(knocking)

01:30.957 --> 01:33.426
(sighs)
Okay, okay.
I'm coming. I'm up.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.996
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Sweet mameloschn.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.634
Who is it?
BUFFY: It's me.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.003
Buffy?
Where's Spike?

01:44.037 --> 01:46.274
Spike?
Spike.
Xander, is he here?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.974
N-N-No, he's out.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.777
U-U-Uh, at least he was
when I got home.
Any idea where he went?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.912
I don't know.
Creature of the night, Buff.

01:52.945 --> 01:54.981
He's probably
out creaturing.

01:56.516 --> 01:57.450
Why? What happened?

01:59.652 --> 02:01.120
Is he in trouble?

02:02.355 --> 02:03.656
I hope not.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.661
(Spike humming)

02:46.433 --> 02:48.602
(resumes humming)

04:18.925 --> 04:20.026
Nora?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.096
Nora?

04:44.016 --> 04:45.452
Buffy?

04:46.687 --> 04:47.788
DAWN:She's not here.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.659
Dawn? Oh, my God.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.096
What are you...

04:56.129 --> 04:58.831
Dawn, what happened here?
What--

05:00.199 --> 05:03.002
You're cut.
I'm all right.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.971
Let me see.
Make sure.

05:05.004 --> 05:06.038
I saw Mom.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.307
What?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.612
She was here, Willow.
I-I saw her.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.048
She was here,
and she spoke to me.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.216
Oh, sweetie.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.788
No, she was--
She was right here, and--

05:20.821 --> 05:22.355
and then she wasn't.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.524
She--
It wasn't her.

05:24.557 --> 05:28.596
What?
Well, at least
I don't think.

05:29.862 --> 05:32.600
I-- I saw something, too.
And it looked like...

05:34.266 --> 05:35.968
someone else.

05:36.002 --> 05:40.307
But it wasn't.
I don't understand.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.709
It's the Big Bad, Dawn.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.812
The one we knew was coming.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.048
But that's what she said.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.683
Mom, she said that
things were coming.
That--

05:50.718 --> 05:52.920
things were
on their way and...

05:54.286 --> 05:56.055
that she loved us.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.293
So, it had to be her, right?
I mean, her warning was true.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.230
I don't know.

06:04.264 --> 06:08.000
I just don't think we can
trust anything right now.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.838
So maybe the evil thing
messing with you
was here, too.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.040
O-Only maybe it was
the thing tryin' to keep...

06:14.074 --> 06:15.242
Mom away.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.745
'Cause she was trying
to protect me.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.550
Maybe.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.954
Why would a vampire
lie about who sired him?

06:26.987 --> 06:29.589
What's that, some kind of
status symbol for the undead?

06:29.622 --> 06:31.459
My sire can beat up your sire?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.428
I'm not saying
I don't believe him.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.430
You just don't want to.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.603
Okay, let's look
at this objectively.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.139
Figure it out in a cold,
impersonal C.S.I.-like manner...

06:46.173 --> 06:49.375
'cause we're a couple of carpet
fibers away from a case.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.879
Spike can't be doing this.
He couldn't if he wanted to.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.115
Why not?
Well, for one thing,
pain chip, remember?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.451
He can't hurt anyone.
It didn't stop him
from hurting you.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.620
Hey, objective here.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.622
Maybe the chip's
not working anymore.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.725
No, it's working.
I've seen it.
Is it?

07:04.757 --> 07:06.526
Or is that what Spike
wants you to think?

07:08.194 --> 07:10.362
You think it's an act?
I don't really know.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.233
And neither do you.
No. Mm-mmh.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.401
Th-There's something,
I-I can feel it.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.204
He's-- He's different.
He's changed.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.608
And if it is an act,

07:21.608 --> 07:23.776
then the Oscar goes to...

07:23.810 --> 07:25.377
(door opens)

07:27.814 --> 07:30.884
Well, this can't be good,
you here at this hour.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.252
There trouble?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.488
No. No trouble.

07:35.523 --> 07:39.326
I-- I was just--
W-We were just--

07:40.459 --> 07:44.031
(chuckles)
Right. None of my business.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.132
No worries.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.468
Spike, I--

07:53.406 --> 07:54.942
H-How was your night?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.009
Oh, it was all right.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.913
And yours?
Did you, uh...

08:01.982 --> 08:03.016
bag any baddies?

08:04.216 --> 08:06.920
One. Vampire.

08:09.488 --> 08:12.425
Uh, someone I used to know,
actually, a little.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.865
Holden. Holden Webster.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.668
You knew him, huh?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.572
That must have
been a picnic.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.108
Yeah.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.212
Well...

08:35.948 --> 08:37.384
I'm gonna turn in
before I drop.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.452
Good night.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.529
You see that?
You see how he reacted
when you mentioned Webs?

08:50.563 --> 08:54.000
Cool as Cool Whip.
What's up with that?

08:54.033 --> 08:57.837
The sun's coming up.
I need to get home
and check on Dawn.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.173
We need to keep
an eye on Spike.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.076
When you say "we",
you mean "me,"
and me's gotta go to work.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.746
I got a big client meeting
in a couple of hours.
Xander, this is serious.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.149
We cannot let him
leave this house until
we know if he's killing again.

09:10.549 --> 09:12.519
We need to find someone
that can watch him.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.255
Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
Come on, Anya. You said
you'd do it on the phone.

09:16.288 --> 09:21.227
Yeah, but that--
That was before you told me
Spike's killing again,

09:21.260 --> 09:22.763
and now you wanna leave me
here alone with him?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.465
You didn't mind being alone
with him before.
What was that?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.134
Nothing.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.971
Look, we don't actually know
that he's killed anyone...

09:32.072 --> 09:33.640
you know, lately.

09:33.673 --> 09:36.043
It might all just be a mistake.
Yeah, but you don't think so.

09:36.076 --> 09:40.312
Okay, have-- have you
searched his room
for clues?

09:40.346 --> 09:44.150
Trophies from victims?
Killers like to keep
trophies sometimes.

09:44.183 --> 09:48.288
Scalps. Necklaces made
from human teeth.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.725
You know,
it didn't occur to me to look,
but thanks for the tip.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.461
Okay, so you'll be safe in here.
Plenty of sunlight
for you to hide in.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.462
What?
That's it?

09:56.495 --> 09:58.932
You're not at least gonna,
like, leave me a crossbow

09:58.966 --> 10:01.168
or a flamethrower,
something to protect myself?

10:01.201 --> 10:03.070
We don't want him to know
we suspect anything.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.437
Besides, if he tries to leave,
I don't want you
confronting him.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.206
Call Buffy
and let her know
that he's on the move.

10:08.841 --> 10:09.777
You're gonna be fine.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.980
Better be.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.014
Because if I get vamped,
I'm gonna bite your ass!

10:15.048 --> 10:18.518
Wouldn't be the first time.
What was that?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.461
BUFFY: Dawn?

10:29.528 --> 10:31.965
Dawn!
Buffy, it's okay.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.268
She's okay. Not hurt.
She's just exhausted.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.171
Finally fell off to sleep.
What the hell happened?

10:38.205 --> 10:40.841
Downstairs looks like--
Hell happened? Yeah.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.509
This big evil that's been
promising to devour us,

10:43.543 --> 10:45.077
well, I think
it started chomping.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.849
Oh, God.
And it started with Dawn?

10:48.881 --> 10:52.820
Both of us.
Buffy, this thing knows us.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.621
It made us think
that we were talking
to people we knew.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.091
Mine said it came
with a message from Tara.

10:59.591 --> 11:01.861
But Dawn actually saw...

11:04.831 --> 11:06.033
your mother.

11:09.568 --> 11:13.405
This thing, it had me
for a while. It...

11:13.440 --> 11:17.177
I mean, before it started
letting loose with
the pulse-pounding terror, it--

11:17.210 --> 11:20.080
but before that,
the lies were...

11:20.113 --> 11:21.581
very convincing.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.583
It just seems real.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.056
Lies?
I mean, maybe--

11:29.088 --> 11:31.825
maybe to confuse us,
to mess us up.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.460
O-Or maybe
just to be cruel.

11:35.095 --> 11:39.566
Vampire I killed last night
told me Spike sired him.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.403
Two nights ago.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.907
W-- Well, that's
impossible, right?

11:46.940 --> 11:50.210
So-- So maybe
it was another one.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.846
A-- A fake-out.
You got one, too.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.847
It wasn't a real vamp.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.917
Dusted real enough.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.452
Buffy,
do you think Spike is--
I can't.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.655
(sighs)
I hope not.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.628
But if I'm wrong,
and he is?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.131
Then I have to see it
for myself.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.169
I have to be there
to stop him.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.861
(exhales)

14:09.381 --> 14:11.183
Anya,

14:11.217 --> 14:15.022
do be specific
and tell a fella just exactly
what you're doing here.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.524
Well...

14:19.591 --> 14:20.559
Spike...

14:23.263 --> 14:26.198
I'm h--
here, obviously,

14:26.232 --> 14:28.201
for, um--

14:32.605 --> 14:33.740
sex.

14:33.773 --> 14:37.543
Uh, beg pardon?

14:37.576 --> 14:41.048
You and me.
Here and now.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.216
Let's go.
(chuckles)

14:44.250 --> 14:48.421
Let's... get it on,
you big, bad boy.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.289
Wait. Wait,
Anya, just a minute.
This is not exact--

14:50.322 --> 14:52.058
Is that a stake?

14:53.759 --> 14:55.495
Yes. Kinky.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.365
Well, yeah,
but what are you--
Shh.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.634
No questions.
No talking.

15:02.970 --> 15:03.971
I can't help it.

15:05.471 --> 15:09.408
I can't stop thinking
about you and us in our...

15:09.442 --> 15:12.345
brief but unforgettable
time together.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.082
I mean, it's--
Why else would I be here?

15:16.115 --> 15:17.985
I mean, it's not like
I'm snooping around

15:18.018 --> 15:20.720
for proof that
you're some sort of
wacked-out serial killer.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.256
(laughs)
I don't why I said that.
Forget I said that.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.259
It's craziness talking.
It's just nerves.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.129
Nerves.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.264
Nerves and--
and horniness.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.267
Oh, just shut up,
William, and take me.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.302
Take me now!

15:35.335 --> 15:37.836
(breathing heavily)

15:41.607 --> 15:43.275
Uh--

15:46.712 --> 15:48.014
(exhales)

15:49.316 --> 15:51.118
Anya--
Hmm?

15:51.150 --> 15:54.421
It's not that
I'm not tempted--
Oh.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.956
Obviously,
if things were different,
you're a right catch.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.859
I got it.
No problem.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.160
I understand.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.298
You think I'm fat.
What?

16:05.331 --> 16:08.168
Either that or the haircut.
Ri-Ridiculous.
The do's quite fetching.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.604
Oh, right.
Now you like the haircut.
Love it.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.341
Sure, as a friend. You know,
you were a lot more fun
when you didn't have a soul.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.775
Oh, come on! Now, I've just
explained to you--

16:16.808 --> 16:20.879
All I'm saying is soulless Spike
would have had me upside down
and halfway to Happyland by now.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.683
I need my pants.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.773
Didn't mean to hurt
your feelings, luv.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.376
Who's hurt?
I'm fine.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.245
(chuckles)
Right.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.450
Look, uh,
I've got things to do.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.220
Don't stick around
on my account.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.730
(door opens, closes)

17:18.938 --> 17:21.540
It's me.
He's leaving.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.979
(harmonica playing)

17:41.760 --> 17:44.063
(hums along)

18:05.984 --> 18:07.487
Hey, man, what's up?

18:56.635 --> 18:57.903
So, um...

18:59.705 --> 19:01.307
What kind of name
is Spike, huh?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.518
(giggles)

19:11.550 --> 19:13.685
What, are you gonna
make me guess?

19:15.688 --> 19:19.025
(laughs)
All right.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.095
I'll guess...

19:24.564 --> 19:25.765
you're a little bit bad.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.835
Huh?

19:33.873 --> 19:36.375
Am I right?

19:36.409 --> 19:38.877
(chuckles)
You a bad boy?

19:40.046 --> 19:44.217
'Cause I don't mind.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.720
You know,
I was getting pretty bored
waiting over there in that line.

19:50.021 --> 19:52.759
I hate... waiting.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.799
Know what I mean?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.082
You know you want it.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.920
You know I want you to.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.722
Um,

20:23.756 --> 20:25.857
is everything--
(growls)

20:25.892 --> 20:27.759
(screaming)

20:31.397 --> 20:33.633
There's my guy.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.009
Now, doesn't that
feel better?

20:58.825 --> 21:01.493
How could you use
a poor maiden so?

21:09.501 --> 21:11.304
Did you kill her?
What?

21:11.337 --> 21:15.007
The girl, last night.
What girl?
What are you talking about?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.809
I caught the first act.
I missed the curtain call.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.779
Did you kill her?
Did you turn her?
Is she one of your kind now?

21:20.813 --> 21:23.249
D-Did you--
Are you following me?

21:23.281 --> 21:25.417
Answer the question.
Where is she?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.253
Who knows?
I talked to her is all.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.789
Really? Looked like
more than talking to me.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.959
Well, I certainly
didn't off her.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.027
(scoffs)
Where are you getting this?

21:36.395 --> 21:39.332
You know I can't.
Right. The chip.

21:39.365 --> 21:42.734
No, not the chip!
Not the chip, damn it.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.438
(scoffs)
You honestly think I'd go

21:45.471 --> 21:48.007
to the end of the underworld
and back to get my soul,
and then--

21:51.042 --> 21:55.481
Buffy, I can barely live
with what I did.
It haunts me.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.518
All of it.

21:58.550 --> 22:02.989
If you think that I would
add to the body count now,
you are crazy.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.191
So, what, you just
troll the promenade

22:05.223 --> 22:09.028
looking for drunk coeds,
'cause you're hungry
for conversation?

22:09.060 --> 22:12.499
Oh, is that what
this is? Right.
What?

22:12.531 --> 22:14.866
You're jealous.
Don't play games.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.803
Not now.
Yeah.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.905
You saw me chattin' up
another bird, givin'
the eye to somebody else.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.973
Touched a nerve,
didn't it?

22:22.008 --> 22:24.343
Don't flatter yourself.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.512
It burns, huh?

22:26.546 --> 22:30.082
But you can't admit it, so you
trump up some charge about me
bein' back on the juice.

22:30.115 --> 22:33.720
This vampire I killed told me.
Told you what?

22:33.752 --> 22:37.256
That I go out?
Yeah, I talk to people.

22:37.288 --> 22:39.258
Women.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.961
Talk to them,
'cause I can't talk to you.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.329
Oh, Spike, save it.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.567
As daft a notion as
"Soulful Spike the Killer" is,

22:47.599 --> 22:51.538
it is nothing compared
to the idea that another girl
could mean anything to me.

22:54.105 --> 22:56.976
This chip,
they did to me.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.211
I couldn't help it.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.213
But the soul,
I got on my own.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.651
For you.

23:09.255 --> 23:13.559
I know. B--
So, yeah, I go
and pass the time...

23:13.593 --> 23:15.561
with someone.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.431
But that's all it is,
is time.

23:18.464 --> 23:21.400
'Cause God help me, Buffy,
it's still all about you.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.807
Spike, this vampire
told me you sired him.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.542
That doesn't mean--
He said you killed him.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.144
Dumped him in
a parking lot somewhere.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.315
And you believed him?
Vampires aren't--
I did follow you last night.

23:36.347 --> 23:40.051
And you know what?
You didn't look lonely
or casual to me.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.253
You looked like
you were on the prowl.

23:42.288 --> 23:44.891
You can't know that.
So then tell me.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.559
Tell me what happened?
You-- You talked to her?
Then what?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.662
We talked.
That's all I remember.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.565
All you remember?
I don't know. I go out.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.567
I talk to people,
or I don't.
It's boring.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.570
It all bleeds together.
Well, if you seem to...

23:58.605 --> 24:00.772
forget that much, then--
Not that.

24:00.807 --> 24:04.343
The taste of human blood?
That I'd remember.

24:04.375 --> 24:08.480
You were camped out
on the Hellmouth
talking to invisible people.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.682
Recently.
How can you be sure of--

24:10.717 --> 24:13.451
No! You are wrong!

24:13.486 --> 24:17.523
You've got an accusation
from a pile of dust
and not a shred of proof.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.992
So I'll get some.

24:32.971 --> 24:36.976
Okay, guys, find me some
evidence that he did this.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.744
Really? Are you sure
that's what you want?

24:39.811 --> 24:42.781
Find me the proof
that he didn't.

24:42.815 --> 24:47.318
Well, you only think Spike
is turning people, 'cause
that vampire told you so, right?

24:47.353 --> 24:51.990
But that night, I mean,
we were all told things
that weren't true.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.460
Maybe.
What?

24:54.492 --> 24:56.563
What maybe?

24:56.596 --> 25:00.799
Well, just because those
weren't the spirits of,
you know, our people,

25:00.833 --> 25:05.436
just because it was some
evil thing, doesn't mean
what they said can't be true.

25:05.538 --> 25:08.173
I used to tell the truth
all the time when I was evil.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.978
We can't assume anything.
We need hard facts.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.914
Well, if Spike
is biting people again,
then shouldn't there be more

25:15.948 --> 25:17.584
dead people
with neck trauma, right?

25:17.616 --> 25:20.051
And we can find that.
(typing)

25:20.086 --> 25:22.520
(beeps)
No.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.156
No, we can't find that?
But that's easy.
The computer's a moron.

25:25.191 --> 25:30.528
I mean, no, there's not
really an increase
in neck injuries. But--

25:31.597 --> 25:33.098
But what?

25:33.132 --> 25:36.102
Oh. Missing people.
Eight maybe?

25:37.302 --> 25:39.672
Oh, ten of them.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.374
No bodies.
They're just missing.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.311
Mostly young,
lots of girls.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.082
So, it's true.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.585
What that vampire told Buffy
turned out to be true.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.355
Maybe.

25:56.387 --> 25:58.223
But it still doesn't prove
that it's Spike.

25:59.557 --> 26:01.594
Right now he's the only one
who knows for sure.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.080
(no audible dialogue)

26:30.321 --> 26:32.858
WOMAN ON TV:Hi! How was
work today, honey?

26:33.859 --> 26:36.095
No, no, no!
You're not goin' out.

26:36.127 --> 26:39.731
I have to go.
Buffy was very clear about
the not leaving of you.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.733
I know what the Slayer
told you. It's not true.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.236
Let me go,
and I'll find a way
to prove it.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.138
Okay, I'm gonna
list the reasons
that won't happen. One--

26:48.140 --> 26:49.375
Ow!

26:51.477 --> 26:54.380
(guitar music playing)

27:00.019 --> 27:02.855
* This is how it goes

27:02.888 --> 27:06.424
* You'll get angry at yourself

27:06.458 --> 27:12.498
* And think you can think
of something else *

27:12.530 --> 27:18.170
* And I'll hear
the clanging of the bells *

27:18.203 --> 27:23.375
* 'Cause I can't
stop you, baby *

27:23.409 --> 27:29.682
* 'Cause I don't have
the bribery in place *

27:29.715 --> 27:35.386
* No bright, shiny surface
to my face *

27:35.421 --> 27:41.827
* So I won't go near
the marketplace *

27:41.861 --> 27:43.829
She had blonde hair.
A nice lookin' girl.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.999
I was here
talkin' with her.

27:47.032 --> 27:50.201
The other night.
I'm lookin' for someone
who might've seen her.

27:51.537 --> 27:55.441
No. Sorry.
 * 'Cause it's all about drugs

27:56.674 --> 28:00.211
* It's all about shame

28:01.881 --> 28:07.419
* And whatever they want

28:07.452 --> 28:10.890
* Don't tell 'em your name

28:14.692 --> 28:18.029
He hit you?
Knocked me out.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.266
He's been gone
at least half an hour.

28:20.298 --> 28:21.700
Any idea where he's headed?

28:27.973 --> 28:30.409
* Oh, Mario

28:30.442 --> 28:33.612
* Sit here by the window

28:33.644 --> 28:35.247
One of them
take your wallet?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.885
What's that?

28:39.919 --> 28:43.288
The way you're scanning
that crowd, you look like
you're out for blood.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.724
I'm just lookin'
for a certain bird
I met here the other night.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.594
Oh.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.299
Is it me?
Sorry, luv.
Don't think so.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.336
Not even if I ask nice?

29:02.407 --> 29:05.176
Or are you the type
that has to be convinced?

29:07.078 --> 29:10.648
Friendly warning, pet.
I'm the type best left alone.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.652
Oh, I get it.

29:13.684 --> 29:16.955
You'd rather I slip into
something more comfortable.

29:21.326 --> 29:23.895
Should we pick off
the crowd one by one...

29:23.930 --> 29:26.332
or block the exits
and ravish the place?

29:26.365 --> 29:29.935
Get away from me.
What's with
the wallflower act?

29:29.969 --> 29:33.471
You didn't seem so shy
when you were... biting me.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.542
I'm not asking if you
want to be soul mates.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.646
Just... figured you'd
wanna have some fun.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.785
Mmm.
I take him. You take her.

29:48.153 --> 29:49.955
Or the other way around.
Whatever.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.690
No, you're lying!

29:56.162 --> 29:58.830
So that all I was to you,
a one-bite stand?

29:58.865 --> 30:01.633
* Because nobody knows

30:01.666 --> 30:04.369
* That's how I nearly fell

30:04.403 --> 30:07.605
* Trading clothes

30:07.638 --> 30:10.608
* And ringing Pavlov's bell

30:10.642 --> 30:13.278
* History shows

30:13.311 --> 30:17.083
* But rarely shows it well

30:18.584 --> 30:20.419
* Well, well, well

30:42.340 --> 30:46.311
* Because nobody knows

30:46.345 --> 30:49.882
* That's how I nearly fell

30:49.915 --> 30:52.750
* Trading clothes

30:52.784 --> 30:54.752
* And ringing Pavlov's bell

30:54.786 --> 30:55.887
(music stops)

31:04.130 --> 31:07.333
* History shows

31:07.365 --> 31:11.037
* But rarely shows it well

31:15.974 --> 31:18.743
Hey, sweetheart,
if you want to go in,
go ahead.

31:18.777 --> 31:22.347
Uh, actually,
I need some help.
I-I'm looking for this guy.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.616
Bleached blond hair,
leather jacket,
British accent, kind of...

31:25.651 --> 31:27.953
sallow but in a hot way?

31:27.987 --> 31:30.388
Yeah, yeah.
I know the guy.
Billy Idol wannabe?

31:30.422 --> 31:33.224
Actually, Billy Idol
stole his look from--

31:33.259 --> 31:35.527
Never mind.
Has he been here?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.262
This guy your boyfriend
or somethin'?

31:38.564 --> 31:41.968
No. I just--
I need to find him
as soon as possible.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.203
Yeah, he comes in here
a lot lately.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.973
Every night leaves
with a different girl.
Chicks like Billy Idol.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.343
How many girls?

31:52.644 --> 31:55.913
Look, this guy that's
not your boyfriend guy?

31:55.948 --> 31:58.817
If I were you,
I'd lose him.
He's a real player.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.596
Man, I hate playing
vampire towns.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.640
Hello? It's me.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.676
I'm seein'--

32:26.877 --> 32:28.213
I think I'm remembering.

32:29.815 --> 32:32.018
I think I've done
some very bad things.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.586
Where are you?
I need--

32:35.621 --> 32:37.923
I need to see you.

32:37.955 --> 32:40.358
There's a house.
634 Hoffman Terrace.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.492
I'll meet you.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.865
You shouldn't have
done that.

32:47.898 --> 32:50.368
It's not time yet.
(chuckles)

32:50.402 --> 32:53.904
Not nearly. You're goin'
against the plan.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.308
But we can make it work.

33:13.224 --> 33:14.559
Down here.

33:25.537 --> 33:26.771
You won't come down?

33:29.075 --> 33:30.675
I understand.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.444
It's a risky proposition.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.683
There's an order.
The Slayer's not in order.

33:38.717 --> 33:42.320
But it can't hurt to play.
Get your claws in the mouse,
you know?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.256
You are not here.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.202
All right, what do you
want to show me?

33:58.604 --> 33:59.904
I've been remembering.

34:01.606 --> 34:04.076
It's the girl.
I walked her home.

34:05.443 --> 34:06.644
The one you saw.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.614
And the one before that.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.952
And I think I killed her.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.956
And I think I--
I think I killed...

34:17.989 --> 34:20.159
the lady who lived here.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.728
And...

34:22.760 --> 34:24.596
And there might be others.

34:27.431 --> 34:29.268
Oh, my God.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.469
Here.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.309
I-- I think
I buried them here.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.047
Spike, why?

34:44.081 --> 34:47.318
Well, I don't know, do I?
I don't even know how.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.887
I shouldn't be able--
 * Early one morning

34:49.920 --> 34:52.590
* Just as the sun was risin'

34:52.623 --> 34:57.163
* I heard a fair maid singing
in the valley down below *

34:57.195 --> 35:00.298
* Oh, don't deceive me
What? What is it?

35:00.331 --> 35:03.101
* Oh, never leave me

35:03.135 --> 35:07.306
* How could you use
a poor maid so *
Spike!

35:14.045 --> 35:15.746
What are you doing?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.148
Aaah!

35:20.518 --> 35:23.021
Spike, listen to me.
You don't wanna do this.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.824
And it's just about
to get fun.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.335
Oh, God.
(growling)

35:50.548 --> 35:52.818
You know what
I want you to do.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.532
They're waiting for you.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.400
Take her.
Taste her.
Make her weak.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.706
Spike! No!

36:18.443 --> 36:20.110
(growling)

36:48.706 --> 36:49.875
I remember.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.068
You've failed them.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.972
Now she's gonna kill you.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.242
You lose, mate.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.148
Sorry, ma'am.
But it's my job.
(coughing)

38:07.552 --> 38:09.286
Do it fast, okay?

38:12.324 --> 38:14.860
He said you would do it.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.161
Who said?

38:18.496 --> 38:19.530
Me.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.168
It was me.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.036
I saw it.

38:27.539 --> 38:31.309
I was here the whole time,
talkin' and singin'.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.913
There was this song.

38:36.681 --> 38:40.518
What are you talking about?
I don't know!

38:40.552 --> 38:43.153
Please, I don't remember.

38:43.188 --> 38:45.023
Don't make me remember.

38:47.257 --> 38:49.193
Make it so I forget again!

38:49.226 --> 38:51.195
I did what you wanted!

38:53.898 --> 38:55.567
There's something here.

39:02.039 --> 39:05.043
Oh, God. No, please,
I need that.

39:06.777 --> 39:09.715
I can't cry this soul
out of me.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.115
It won't come.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.219
I've killed,
and I can feel 'em.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.523
I can feel
every one of 'em.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.034
There's something
playing with us.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.271
All of us.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.445
What is it?

39:41.579 --> 39:43.047
Why is it
doin' this to me?

39:45.451 --> 39:47.284
I don't know.

39:50.422 --> 39:54.259
Will you... help me?

39:57.929 --> 39:59.797
Can you help me?

40:03.268 --> 40:04.570
BUFFY: I'll help you.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.476
ANYA:
And you believe him?

40:12.643 --> 40:14.713
BUFFY:
You didn't see him
down there.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.514
He really didn't know
what he'd done.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.985
It wasn't in his control.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.653
Oh, an out-of-control
serial killer.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.922
You're right. That is
a great house guest.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.791
Wait. Is he--

40:26.824 --> 40:30.161
Is he staying here?
I don't know.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.764
But I'm not letting him
out of my sight,
that's for sure.

40:32.797 --> 40:36.467
Buffy, he's been feeding--
on human blood.
That's gotta do stuff.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.369
I'm not keeping him around
just to help him.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.407
I think there was
something there

40:42.440 --> 40:44.309
talking to him,
making him do things.

40:44.342 --> 40:47.311
Something like what was
talking to us?

40:47.344 --> 40:49.414
Maybe.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.315
And if it was, then it's
been screwin' with Spike
big-time.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.085
So, you want him
around because...

40:55.119 --> 40:57.623
Look, there's
something evil working us,

40:57.655 --> 40:59.356
and if we are ever gonna have
a chance to fight it,

40:59.389 --> 41:01.358
we need to learn
everything we can about it.

41:01.391 --> 41:04.362
This thing has been
closer to Spike
than any of us.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.666
And if you want
to understand it...

41:08.699 --> 41:10.367
I'm gonna have to
get close to Spike.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.938
Nah, it's too dangerous.
BUFFY:
I don't have a choice.

41:12.971 --> 41:16.807
Whatever this thing is,
from beneath us, it's bad.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.144
And it's only getting worse.

41:30.420 --> 41:32.157
Oh, dear God!

41:35.492 --> 41:37.596
Robson, are you here?

41:39.831 --> 41:41.199
Robson!

41:41.231 --> 41:43.702
(shallow breathing)

41:50.340 --> 41:51.442
You, too?

42:01.251 --> 42:03.755
Dear God,
I thought you were--
Gather them.

42:03.789 --> 42:06.557
What?
It's started.

42:07.592 --> 42:08.594
It's all right.

42:08.626 --> 42:10.695
I understand.
I'll take care of--
