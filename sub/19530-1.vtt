- [Rita]: What do you think?
- Oh, dear.

10:56.754 --> 10:58.724
You think there's enough light here?

10:58.844 --> 11:01.054
Just think of it as a pet rock

11:01.079 --> 11:03.470
with the potential to be a side dish.

11:03.590 --> 11:06.182
They've already named it Charlene.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.202
- Oh.
- What about over here?

11:08.322 --> 11:10.189
That's a good sign, actually.

11:10.214 --> 11:11.480
How so, Ms. Mclnerney?

11:11.505 --> 11:14.025
[Quietly] Well... They're
not ready to formally take

11:14.145 --> 11:15.955
the next step in their relationship,

11:15.980 --> 11:17.313
so they've found a way

11:17.338 --> 11:19.810
to create a sort of
family with a surrogate...

11:20.493 --> 11:22.277
Potato.

11:22.302 --> 11:24.264
I really need to leave now.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.150
Okay, say hi to your dad for me.

11:26.175 --> 11:28.750
Oh, and, um... Oliver?

11:30.616 --> 11:34.485
I see that we're back to
saying "Ms. Mclnerney."

11:35.122 --> 11:36.621
Yes, uh, well...

11:38.625 --> 11:41.059
I think it might be more
important than ever

11:41.084 --> 11:44.232
to keep things... professional at work.

11:44.257 --> 11:46.654
But come tomorrow night, I fully intend

11:46.774 --> 11:48.368
to call you Shane...

11:50.037 --> 11:51.309
Ms. Mclnerney.

12:08.535 --> 12:09.634
Dad!

12:09.659 --> 12:10.758
Hey!

12:11.058 --> 12:13.458
Welcome to my retirement!

12:13.678 --> 12:15.144
Oh, uh...

12:15.929 --> 12:17.295
[Laughs]

12:18.236 --> 12:19.688
I wanted to talk about something.

12:20.052 --> 12:21.305
You know, I wrote that list

12:21.330 --> 12:23.430
of things I wanted to do when I retired.

12:23.455 --> 12:25.355
Travel, learn Italian,

12:25.380 --> 12:27.047
work in a garden.

12:27.374 --> 12:28.685
Uh...

12:28.989 --> 12:30.388
And then I realized

12:30.413 --> 12:31.912
that those things
would be a lot more fun

12:31.937 --> 12:34.738
if I didn't do them by myself.

12:34.763 --> 12:36.362
Oh, well, naturally.

12:36.387 --> 12:38.820
I'm not much of a
gardener, it's very messy,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.511
but I do love to travel, of course...

12:40.536 --> 12:43.286
I'm talking about needing some...

12:43.406 --> 12:45.829
- Company.
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.854 --> 12:46.920
Female company.

12:48.217 --> 12:49.428
Oh.

12:49.453 --> 12:53.159
I-I dated a little, you know,
after your mother left us,

12:53.279 --> 12:54.557
but nothing serious.

12:54.582 --> 12:57.550
But now I'm settled here, and, uh...

12:57.689 --> 12:59.371
I may not be old yet,

12:59.396 --> 13:01.196
but I will be someday.

13:01.221 --> 13:02.654
I don't want to do it alone.

13:02.679 --> 13:03.747
I see.

13:03.772 --> 13:07.634
Well, uh, there is a
book club at my church,

13:07.659 --> 13:10.847
- or we could find a seniors' group...
- Or I could just...

13:10.967 --> 13:13.868
Walk over to Kate and
ask her out right now.

13:15.719 --> 13:16.806
Kate.

13:17.001 --> 13:18.734
She's, uh...

13:18.759 --> 13:21.328
In charge of the butterfly garden,
and I'm handling the vegetables.

13:21.448 --> 13:23.949
And you are telling me this because...

13:23.974 --> 13:26.207
Well, let's face it,

13:26.232 --> 13:28.594
- we're different people.
- Mm-hmm.

13:28.714 --> 13:31.548
When I make a decision, I act.

13:32.762 --> 13:35.211
And I know you don't
like to rush things,

13:35.236 --> 13:38.103
and it's taken you a while to
get things going with Shane,

13:38.223 --> 13:40.947
and so I just, I don't want
you to feel awkward

13:40.972 --> 13:42.539
if I actually...

13:42.892 --> 13:44.859
Move a little faster than you.

13:44.884 --> 13:46.884
[Laughing] Well...

13:46.909 --> 13:51.230
Dad, Shane and I are
going out tomorrow, so...

13:51.255 --> 13:53.040
Well, there you go.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.453
That's great.

13:54.573 --> 13:56.673
Yeah. Okay.

13:56.957 --> 13:58.891
Nothin' to worry about then.

13:58.916 --> 14:00.206
[Chuckles]

14:01.939 --> 14:03.939
Well, she could be an "Irish cobbler,"

14:03.964 --> 14:06.431
or a "chieftain"... Ooh, or a "viking."

14:06.456 --> 14:09.824
She's definitely some sort
of early variety of heirloom.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.451
She's definitely not
your average potato.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.009
- Nope.
- Listen to this.

14:14.034 --> 14:15.481
Almost 400,000 people

14:15.506 --> 14:17.709
evacuated New Orleans
when the levees broke.

14:17.734 --> 14:19.643
And a lot of them are
still living in Colorado,

14:19.668 --> 14:21.835
because they can't
afford to move back home.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.490
Or they didn't have
a home to go back to.

14:23.515 --> 14:25.583
I wonder if that's what
happened to Gabe.

14:25.608 --> 14:27.241
[Door opens] I'm back, everyone.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.668
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.259
Hey, how's your dad?

14:30.284 --> 14:31.316
He's fine.

14:31.341 --> 14:33.167
Doing some volunteer work.

14:33.192 --> 14:36.493
Making new, uh, friends.

14:36.518 --> 14:39.244
I thought we might get
back to, uh, that letter.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.970
Oh, Shane's already got started on Gabe,

14:40.995 --> 14:42.279
and we've been working on Hattie.

14:42.376 --> 14:44.286
Yeah, I can't lift the
ink from the envelope

14:44.311 --> 14:45.843
without erasing Hattie's address.

14:45.868 --> 14:47.934
We even tried "Norman
Dorman's revelation solution."

14:47.959 --> 14:50.581
We might want to start going back
through some old phone books.

14:50.701 --> 14:51.782
Okay.

14:52.393 --> 14:53.459
Ms. Mclnerney?

14:53.484 --> 14:55.017
It's not looking good.

14:55.042 --> 14:56.976
All we've got is some guy named Gabe,

14:57.001 --> 14:59.001
who walked into some
sort of establishment,

14:59.026 --> 15:00.526
like a blues club,

15:00.551 --> 15:02.223
and sang a song, and had a good meal.

15:02.343 --> 15:03.643
And fell in love.

15:03.668 --> 15:06.308
- You think so?
- Oh, well, uh, where were we?

15:06.428 --> 15:07.527
Oh...

15:07.552 --> 15:09.185
"I'd always had the music in me,

15:09.210 --> 15:11.477
"but I'd forgotten what
it was for until you."

15:11.502 --> 15:13.190
He's obviously falling in love.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.630
Well, not necessarily.

15:14.655 --> 15:16.110
I mean, maybe he just thought

15:16.135 --> 15:17.601
she was being really encouraging.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.848
Well, I disagree.

15:18.873 --> 15:19.887
Uh...

15:19.912 --> 15:21.555
"I know what will keep me going.

15:21.675 --> 15:22.918
"Remembering you."

15:23.571 --> 15:26.446
If Gabe wrote one love letter,
maybe he wrote more,

15:26.471 --> 15:28.394
hoping one of them might get through

15:28.419 --> 15:29.956
all the chaos after Katrina.

15:29.981 --> 15:32.314
And if Hattie received
just one of those letters,

15:32.339 --> 15:34.829
then perhaps they found each other.

15:34.854 --> 15:37.636
Ergo, find Hattie, find Gabe.

15:37.661 --> 15:40.295
Of course, if they're not together...

15:40.320 --> 15:43.105
- Hattie might still have information...
<i>- Got something!</i>

15:43.225 --> 15:45.788
New Orleans yellow pages 2004 to 2005,

15:45.813 --> 15:48.525
there's a club called
Hattie's Backstreet Blues,

15:48.550 --> 15:51.253
45 St. James street.

15:51.278 --> 15:53.511
"Try our famous oysters.

15:53.547 --> 15:55.347
"Open mic night every Tuesday."

15:56.349 --> 15:58.871
- Nothing's coming up.
- All right, give me a second.

16:00.247 --> 16:02.113
Um...

16:02.672 --> 16:05.931
Yellow pages 2006, 2007...

16:07.329 --> 16:09.196
Um... yeah,

16:09.221 --> 16:11.956
there's nothing listed at
all after hurricane Katrina.

16:14.253 --> 16:16.104
Because it's gone.

16:21.696 --> 16:22.941
It's not hopeless.

16:22.976 --> 16:24.825
If Hattie's place was destroyed,

16:24.850 --> 16:27.145
then she may have applied
for a federal relief loan.

16:27.265 --> 16:28.481
And if that's the case,

16:28.506 --> 16:30.773
then I can hack into any
number of government records...

16:30.798 --> 16:33.421
[Clears throat] Ms. Mclnerney,
I am quite confident

16:33.446 --> 16:35.813
that you and your
computer could infiltrate

16:35.838 --> 16:37.824
the deepest galaxies of cyberspace,

16:37.849 --> 16:39.192
but please,

16:39.312 --> 16:42.192
don't say anything we might
have to repeat in court.

16:42.217 --> 16:43.255
Fair enough,

16:43.280 --> 16:45.413
but we still have to find
her last name somehow.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.570
Any ideas?

16:46.595 --> 16:48.301
I once got my name in the newspaper,

16:48.326 --> 16:49.358
sort of.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.911
You did? I didn't know that.

16:50.936 --> 16:53.720
I don't talk about it much.
And the charges were dropped.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.336
You were arrested?

16:55.361 --> 16:57.343
It was just a
misunderstanding at the zoo.

16:57.368 --> 16:59.377
I was actually trying
to return the penguin.

16:59.402 --> 17:01.856
Wait, I remember that
story. That was you?

17:01.976 --> 17:05.134
Yeah, "man cleared in
runaway penguin escapade."

17:05.159 --> 17:06.490
I was the unidentified man.

17:06.515 --> 17:08.782
Norman, you're a genius.

17:08.808 --> 17:11.238
Here we go, from the New
Orleans Times Picayune,

17:11.358 --> 17:13.128
August 10th, 2002.

17:13.154 --> 17:14.854
"... also petitioning the city council

17:14.878 --> 17:16.463

proposed traffic light

17:16.488 --> 17:17.988

17:19.492 --> 17:21.970
"proprietor of Hattie's
Backstreet Blues Club."

17:21.994 --> 17:23.635
Of course, Hatfield!

17:23.660 --> 17:25.231
Hattie is her nickname!

17:25.256 --> 17:27.676
- Ooh, I wish I had a nickname.
- I'll think of one.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.834
Excellent work, Ms. Mclnerney.

17:30.010 --> 17:32.740
Well, now the fun starts. I've
got a search program here

17:32.860 --> 17:34.802
that I can adapt to
filter for old records,

17:34.827 --> 17:37.354
or relief applications,
or evacuee lists,

17:37.379 --> 17:38.786
anything Katrina-related

17:38.811 --> 17:40.110
that might help us see

17:40.135 --> 17:41.989
where Hattie may have ended up.

17:42.592 --> 17:43.891
Start.

17:44.079 --> 17:46.079
- _
- Now we just have to wait.

17:51.319 --> 17:52.442
No...

17:52.562 --> 17:55.328
No, no, no, no...

17:56.550 --> 17:58.050
Eleanor's kombucha recipe.

17:58.170 --> 18:00.037
I think I left it in the box

18:00.062 --> 18:02.741
of old reader's digests
that I had Norman throw out.

18:02.766 --> 18:04.172
I'm sorry. What did I do?

18:04.197 --> 18:06.044
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

18:06.243 --> 18:08.544
Now I'll never make one as good as hers.

18:08.579 --> 18:10.312
I'm sorry, Ms. Mclnerney.

18:10.348 --> 18:13.091
I know how much that "kumbacha" recipe

18:13.211 --> 18:15.150
- meant to you.
- "Kombucha."

18:15.186 --> 18:16.318
"Kum-bah-cha."

18:16.354 --> 18:18.636
- "Kom-bu-cha."
- "Kum-bah-cha."

18:18.756 --> 18:20.058
Forget it.

18:20.178 --> 18:21.957
I need chocolate.

18:23.827 --> 18:26.572
Serious... Serious chocolate.

18:29.266 --> 18:31.033
It feels so decadent
to be having dessert

18:31.068 --> 18:32.568
in the middle of the afternoon.

18:32.609 --> 18:34.826
Well, Reets, somewhere in
the world, it's dinnertime.

18:34.946 --> 18:37.288
- "Reets?"
- Yeah, I'm working on your nickname.

18:37.313 --> 18:39.174
Oh. Let's keep working on it.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.210
- [Chuckles awkwardly]
- Uh... Reetster?

18:41.245 --> 18:43.212
Uh... Reety-reety?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.546
Uh... Reets-meets?

18:44.582 --> 18:46.419
- [Groaning] No...
- That's bad.

18:46.884 --> 18:48.250
It's running every name

18:48.285 --> 18:49.918
registered with the city of New Orleans

18:49.954 --> 18:52.198
during the weeks after Katrina,
and if that doesn't work,

18:52.318 --> 18:54.990
I'll move on to state
and federal records.

18:55.026 --> 18:56.227
Remarkable.

18:58.796 --> 19:00.274
I think...

19:00.865 --> 19:04.033
We should read on a bit while we wait.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.645
Wow.

19:05.976 --> 19:08.185
Oliver O'Toole breaking protocol.

19:08.305 --> 19:09.838
What is that all about?

19:09.874 --> 19:11.381
I'm, um...

19:12.243 --> 19:14.209
Not sure. [Chuckles]

19:14.245 --> 19:15.511
Ovilear!

19:15.536 --> 19:16.635
Ramon!

19:16.660 --> 19:18.526
Ramon, what are you doing here?

19:18.551 --> 19:21.728
- Yeah, what are you doing here?
- Well, I have great news!

19:21.848 --> 19:24.601
I am the new owner
of the Mailbox Grille.

19:24.721 --> 19:26.637
- [Laughing in delight]
- Are you kidding me?

19:26.757 --> 19:28.290
Why? Why?

19:28.325 --> 19:29.892
It is a marvelous venue!

19:29.927 --> 19:32.017
And I have great plans for it.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.303
I see...

19:33.328 --> 19:34.730
A Sunday brunch.

19:34.850 --> 19:36.065
Perhaps...

19:36.100 --> 19:37.866
A mailbox Martini menu,

19:37.902 --> 19:40.755
and, of course, we must
improve on the jukebox, eh?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.971
Oh, that's right, you
know a lot about music.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.206
Oliver,

19:44.241 --> 19:46.141
can Ramon listen to the rest of letter?

19:46.177 --> 19:48.529
He might be able to hear
something that we don't.

19:48.649 --> 19:50.245
- Oh, I don't...
- Ah!

19:54.752 --> 19:57.809
"I know you could've gotten
somebody else to fix the bar,

19:57.929 --> 20:00.117
"but maybe you could
tell I needed the work,

20:00.458 --> 20:02.424
"and the company... "

A man named Gabe, he
plays a guitar and sings.

Denver, so we were hoping

44:43.791 --> 44:46.458

who they really are.

44:57.805 --> 44:59.705

44:59.740 --> 45:02.107

- Would that day be Sunday?
- Every Sunday.

45:37.195 --> 45:39.132

45:39.252 --> 45:41.346

the State Capitol is...

45:41.382 --> 45:43.093
exactly 5,280 feet,

49:10.968 --> 49:13.202
you gotta hand all
that over to the Lord,

49:13.237 --> 49:15.136
and you gotta keep singing.

49:15.707 --> 49:17.926
That's what you were born to do.

49:19.811 --> 49:22.311
What you need is vision.

And it is hard to get vision
down here in the ninth ward.

I watch the sunrise,

49:52.877 --> 49:55.427
and I count my blessings,

49:56.194 --> 49:57.658

49:57.778 --> 49:59.815
I feel like I am standing a mile high.

50:01.252 --> 50:02.718
And when you feel a mile high,

50:02.754 --> 50:04.954
anything is possible.

up here every Sunday,

going back to New Orleans?

got one of my letters,

what if somehow, one of
them got forwarded to her?

came late, like this one?

tell you this, but...

The truth is,

every letter that comes to our office

51:10.788 --> 51:12.664
is a sacred trust,

means at our disposal

56:19.063 --> 56:22.231
I'm not very good at keeping secrets.

56:22.266 --> 56:24.366
The bad ones hurt my heart.

56:24.402 --> 56:26.202
So...

56:26.237 --> 56:28.938
A few Sundays ago,

56:28.973 --> 56:30.840
I went to the capitol
steps to see Gabe, and...

56:30.875 --> 56:33.458
- And you told him about Hattie?
- I didn't have to tell him.

56:33.578 --> 56:35.578
He kinda figured it out
when he saw my face.

56:35.613 --> 56:37.069
Norman...

56:37.189 --> 56:38.914
He said that deep down inside,

56:38.950 --> 56:42.333
he always suspected that
if Hattie's club was gone,

56:42.453 --> 56:45.221
that probably meant she was, too.

56:45.256 --> 56:48.257
But that wasn't going
to stop him from...

56:48.292 --> 56:51.927
"Keeping the faith," he called it.

56:51.963 --> 56:53.896
And when I left, he
picked up his guitar,

56:53.931 --> 56:56.177
and he started singing again.

56:59.540 --> 57:01.539
You do know,

57:01.659 --> 57:03.873
the definition of insanity

57:03.908 --> 57:06.542
is doing the same thing
over and over again

57:06.577 --> 57:10.079
and expecting a different outcome?

57:10.114 --> 57:11.894
Like...

57:13.600 --> 57:15.818
Waiting for your mother to come back,

57:15.853 --> 57:18.550
and waiting for your
wife to come back, and...

57:19.695 --> 57:22.229
Waiting for Shane to come back?

57:26.597 --> 57:29.064
Maybe standing on those steps is insane.

57:29.100 --> 57:31.321
Maybe it's the only way that Gabe knows

57:31.441 --> 57:33.695
how to keep Hattie alive.

57:35.127 --> 57:36.472
All I know is,

57:36.507 --> 57:37.840
when I walked away,

57:37.875 --> 57:40.099
he was already singing a new song,

57:40.219 --> 57:41.644
and it hit me.

57:43.648 --> 57:45.314
What?

57:45.349 --> 57:48.083
Well, you and I, Oliver,

57:48.119 --> 57:52.755
we have a lot more to hope
for than Gabe does now,

57:52.790 --> 57:54.590
but he's the one out there singing.

58:04.135 --> 58:05.935
[Sighs]

58:07.204 --> 58:09.672
I don't know what to do.

58:15.546 --> 58:17.479
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.516

58:20.551 --> 58:22.651

59:31.999 --> 59:34.123
- Okay, look...
- Mr. Marek...

59:34.243 --> 59:35.756
I have an employee

59:35.876 --> 59:38.014
who hasn't reported
to work for three months

59:38.049 --> 59:41.932
with no paperwork to
support her absence.

59:42.052 --> 59:44.575
Unless you can provide
compelling reasons

59:44.695 --> 59:46.502
to the contrary, I would like
my employee back now.

59:46.622 --> 59:48.475
You can't have her back,
she's critical to the mission.

59:48.595 --> 59:50.729
- Oh, I'll bet she is.
- Listen, Oliver,

59:50.849 --> 59:53.627
- I understand your situation...
- No, you don't.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.928
And that situation has changed.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.952
We were out of the country.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:18.421
We had to turn in our laptops,

01:00:18.456 --> 01:00:20.972
and tablets, and phones.
We couldn't carry anything

01:00:21.092 --> 01:00:23.895
that could be tracked, or
hacked, or compromised.

01:00:24.015 --> 01:00:25.728
There are means

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.100
by which you could have contacted us

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.133

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.827

01:00:32.947 --> 01:00:36.264

have been breaking the rules,

01:00:36.384 --> 01:00:38.082
and you, of all people, should...

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:41.243
Wait, how do you know
about burner phones?

01:00:41.279 --> 01:00:43.514
Sometimes, we watch

01:00:43.634 --> 01:00:45.915
action movies on poker night.

01:00:46.448 --> 01:00:47.850

what I am doing here right now

01:01:08.227 --> 01:01:10.039
is really important.

that needs to be done.

01:01:12.657 --> 01:01:15.412
- Are you sure?
- That's what Steve says.

01:01:15.532 --> 01:01:18.180
Well, then it must be true.

01:01:20.685 --> 01:01:22.935
Do you really think that if
I could go back to Denver,

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:26.455
I would spend one more minute here?

01:01:26.491 --> 01:01:28.712
I don't know about having a chance,

01:01:28.832 --> 01:01:32.361
but I know you have a choice.

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:37.833

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.706
Did you find Gabe?

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:46.412
I promised I would, and we did.

01:01:46.532 --> 01:01:49.541
That's great, because I
have news about Hattie.

01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:53.382
I couldn't stop thinking about
her, so every chance I had,

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.636
I would run a new search
for old tax records,

01:01:55.756 --> 01:01:57.498
or old employment records,

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:59.555
anything that I could
think of, really, and...

01:02:00.154 --> 01:02:01.424
I found something.

01:02:02.527 --> 01:02:04.817
- And... ?
- I think she's alive.

01:02:04.937 --> 01:02:07.430
An A.G. Hatfield spent three
days trapped in the Superdome,

01:02:07.465 --> 01:02:10.081
and then evacuated to
Houston, which is probably why

01:02:10.201 --> 01:02:12.077
she dropped off the rolls in Louisiana.

01:02:12.197 --> 01:02:15.320
Now, from what I can tell, if it is her,

01:02:16.156 --> 01:02:18.958
it seems that she started
over again in Austin.

01:02:19.544 --> 01:02:21.701
I only have a street address,

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.746
but no number.

01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:27.385
I was gonna follow up
when this was all over,

01:02:27.505 --> 01:02:30.186
but now that you're here...

01:02:33.404 --> 01:02:36.392
I hope she was worth waiting for.

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:40.996
So do I.

going to give it back

- Goodbye, Ms. McInerney.

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:38.687

01:03:38.722 --> 01:03:40.802

which occurred three months ago

01:03:46.025 --> 01:03:48.163
was resolved over three weeks ago,

01:03:48.198 --> 01:03:50.225

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:24.553

And the fourth one

01:19:47.423 --> 01:19:48.814
is about how I'm...

01:19:49.311 --> 01:19:52.527
I'm afraid I'm gonna die
before I can see you again.

01:19:55.185 --> 01:19:56.717
And the fifth one

01:19:56.753 --> 01:20:00.054
is about deciding to survive it all

01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:03.974
so that I can come back
to this crazy, stupid place.

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:07.989
And now you've moved my desk, and you...

01:20:27.784 --> 01:20:31.519
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>

01:20:43.233 --> 01:20:45.952
I thought of you every day.

01:20:47.452 --> 01:20:50.938
I know that might be hard
for you to believe, but...

01:20:50.974 --> 01:20:53.141
You'd be surprised.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.990
[Gasps]

01:21:24.507 --> 01:21:26.164
How have you been?

01:21:27.224 --> 01:21:28.491
Lonely.

01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:35.216
Norman and Rita are engaged.

01:21:36.251 --> 01:21:38.519
No... [Laughs in delight]

01:21:39.923 --> 01:21:42.957
And, uh, my father fell
in love with a lepidopterist

01:21:42.992 --> 01:21:44.887
who ran away with a

01:21:45.007 --> 01:21:46.532
fertilizer salesman.

01:21:47.931 --> 01:21:50.464
Some people just don't
know what they have.

01:21:53.089 --> 01:21:55.236
That is true.

01:22:00.543 --> 01:22:02.910
So, what do we do now?

01:22:12.634 --> 01:22:14.145
I am going to

01:22:14.265 --> 01:22:16.789
make you the perfect "Kumbahcha... "

01:22:18.616 --> 01:22:21.053
- [Together]: Kom-bu-cha...
- smoothie, and...

01:22:21.678 --> 01:22:23.067
And you

01:22:23.187 --> 01:22:25.869
are going to read
me all of your letters.

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:32.229
That could take all night.

01:22:43.032 --> 01:22:44.285
Good.

01:22:51.728 --> 01:22:54.662
So, you think you've found

01:22:54.697 --> 01:22:56.464
the perfect...

01:22:56.499 --> 01:22:59.567
Kombucha smoothie recipe, huh?

01:22:59.602 --> 01:23:01.702
Oh, well, it's, uh...

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:04.238
It's about the secret ingredient.

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:08.009
[Laughing]

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:11.145
<i>♪ Well, I'm gonna make ♪</i>

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:14.402
<i>♪ my world  a better place... ♪</i>

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:15.583
"Dear Oliver,

01:23:15.618 --> 01:23:17.885
"when we lifted off and
flew into the clouds,

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.237
"I realized that you have
made a believer out of me.

01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:24.558
"It was no mistake
that I was transferred

01:23:24.594 --> 01:23:26.227
"to the dead letter office

01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:28.829
"instead of direct line operations."

01:23:28.949 --> 01:23:30.508
[Chuckles]

01:23:31.555 --> 01:23:35.431
"We could not have begun
dancing together so long ago

01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:37.204
"without learning the steps we needed

"to find our way back to each other... "
