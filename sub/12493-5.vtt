WEBVTT

00:04.291 --> 00:05.542
And now for the finishing touch...

00:06.000 --> 00:08.750
Mr. Pancake Smiley Face
gets a cherry nose.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.750
That's so cute. Is that for Charlie?

00:12.417 --> 00:13.959
Uh, yeah, for Charlie.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.333
Thank you.

00:19.792 --> 00:20.792
Hey, honey,

00:21.375 --> 00:22.417
I got some great news.

00:22.625 --> 00:25.542
There was a bedbug infestation
at this really nice hotel downtown...

00:26.125 --> 00:28.208
Bob, it is amazing what gets you excited.

00:30.709 --> 00:31.709
Anyway,

00:31.792 --> 00:34.458
the manager of the hotel
was so pleased with the job I did.

00:34.709 --> 00:38.041
He's letting us stay in their most
romantic suite this Saturday night.

00:38.542 --> 00:39.625
That's great!

00:39.709 --> 00:41.917
You did get rid of all the bedbugs, right?

00:43.125 --> 00:44.834
It's not an exact science, honey.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.583
The point is it's free!

00:49.625 --> 00:52.458
Well, there's just one catch.
Who's gonna watch Charlie?

00:52.542 --> 00:53.458
We'll do it.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.417
We're very responsible.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.208
Don't worry. I'll be here too.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.542
Thanks.

01:01.709 --> 01:02.667
You guys are great.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.375
All right!

01:04.458 --> 01:06.542
It sure is nice to have kids we can trust.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.583
And PJ.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.458
Both: Let's throw a party!

01:12.542 --> 01:13.667
Both: Wait what?

01:14.125 --> 01:15.125
No, me first.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.417
I said let's throw a party
when Mom and Dad are out of the house.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.375
When do you ever do bad things?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.208
I can be bad.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.583
I can be very bad.

01:24.667 --> 01:25.583
Cannot.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.041
- Oh yeah?
- Uh-huh.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.375
Watch this.

01:28.417 --> 01:30.417
I'm gonna drink milk
right out of the carton...

01:30.750 --> 01:32.250
because I'm bad.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.792
Are you gonna swallow?

01:40.875 --> 01:42.041
Uh-uh.

01:43.333 --> 01:44.875
- You wanna spit it out?
- Mm-hm.

What's next?

02:57.208 --> 02:58.458
Making my own bed?

03:03.125 --> 03:04.000
Hey, Jo.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.500
Why is your arm in a cast?

03:05.583 --> 03:07.250
Oh. Broke my finger.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.125
- See, I was playing baseball--
- Okay, now back to me.

03:13.458 --> 03:16.750
My mom says I have to go
to this stupid thing called cotillion.

03:17.041 --> 03:20.000
It's a stupid class where they teach you
manners and social graces...

03:20.291 --> 03:21.792
Other stupid stuff.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.500
And there's a stupid dance
and I have to bring a stupid date.

03:26.709 --> 03:27.750
So, I thought of you.

03:30.375 --> 03:31.583
Pass. Bye-bye now.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.041
Oh come on, Gabe.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.041
I think it'd be a great idea
for you to go to cotillion.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.083
Oh, now you show up.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.333
Come on, I'll get you a little suit,
we'll get Jo a lovely corsage.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.250
Trust me, you'll love it.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.875
Ever notice the things
you say I'm gonna love...

03:47.250 --> 03:48.333
I never love?

03:50.083 --> 03:50.959
Yeah.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.000
Gabe's looking forward to it.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.875
See you tonight, stupid.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.625
Not that she needs any social graces.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.083
So I don't have a say in this?
You're just gonna force me to go?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
Oh, sweetie, that's part
of the fun of being a parent.

04:10.875 --> 04:11.792
Besides,

04:12.333 --> 04:14.250
I want at least one of my kids
to have manners.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.834
Mom, we're out of buns.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.917
Oh yeah, you're going.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.083
Okay, try this one. Open up. Okay.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.166
Crunchy...

04:36.625 --> 04:37.583
and smooth.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.750
It's a corn chip with a scoop
of peanut butter.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.709
I call it a "cornbutt".

04:46.959 --> 04:47.917
It's good.

04:48.542 --> 04:49.542
Needs a new name.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.250
Hey.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.125
What are you guys doing?

04:54.750 --> 04:56.125
Testing snacks for the party.

04:56.417 --> 04:57.375
Care for a...

04:57.959 --> 04:59.041
Buttchip?

05:01.375 --> 05:03.000
How about I handle the snacks?

05:05.458 --> 05:06.959
Oh, um, Teddy?

05:07.834 --> 05:09.417
- Looking forward to the party?
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.583 --> 05:11.917
May I have the first dance?

05:13.542 --> 05:14.959
You have buttchip breath.

05:17.458 --> 05:18.458
I'll go brush.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.375
I was being insulted and you should
have defended me!

05:24.458 --> 05:25.333
I couldn't.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.959
Too busy being embarrassed by you.

05:28.583 --> 05:29.959
What's going on?

05:30.333 --> 05:32.625
Ask the woman who just got kicked out
of the grocery store.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.500
I was standing
in the 15-items-or-less line.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.083
- Just minding my own business...
- With 17 items.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.417
...when this crazy woman in line behind us
starts screaming at me to get out of line.

05:46.792 --> 05:48.166
Your mother handled it well though.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.583
Grabbed the pricing gun,
scanned the woman's face.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.875
And through this entire
ugly confrontation.

05:56.208 --> 05:59.458
Your father stood there,
like an oaf, eating a donut.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.875
I was trying to get us down to 15 items.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.291
PJ,

06:06.417 --> 06:08.875
tell your father that I will not be
speaking to him,

06:08.959 --> 06:11.542
until he apologizes for not backing me up.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.083
Okay.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.291
Teddy, tell your mother
I will not apologize,

06:18.375 --> 06:23.709
and that I will not be speaking to her
until she apologizes for embarrassing me.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.000
Whoa.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.041
Glad I didn't get that one.

06:34.959 --> 06:38.083
Good evening and welcome to cotillion.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.500
I am Mr. Krump.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.083
And I am Mrs. Krump.

06:43.709 --> 06:46.166
And I am planning revenge on my mother.

06:47.417 --> 06:49.500
How are you this evening, Mr. Krump?

06:49.583 --> 06:52.166
Very well, thank you. And you, Mrs. Krump?

06:52.250 --> 06:55.417
Oh, very well, Mr. Krump.
Thank you.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.500
I have never hated
two people so fast before.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.208
Now we'll be learning the art

07:04.250 --> 07:06.667
of complimenting one's dinner partner.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.667
You look very lovely
this evening, Mrs. Krump.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.542
And you look most handsome, Mr. Krump.

07:15.875 --> 07:19.208
Now, children, your turn.
Compliment your partners.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.208
Good evening, Miss Keener.

07:23.291 --> 07:26.208
Your eyes are as blue as the vein
on Mrs. Krump's leg.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.000
Why, thank you, Mr. Duncan.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.333
And may I say, your cast is as green

07:31.417 --> 07:34.125
as the booger peeking out
of Mr. Krump's nose.

07:36.125 --> 07:41.291
Now, gentlemen, escort your ladies
to a table and take your seats.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.000
Now,

07:46.083 --> 07:51.583
when dining, it is most important
to use the proper utensils.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.166
So, pick up your smallest spoon,

07:54.709 --> 07:57.667
and enjoy some melon ball.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.792
Here, Miss Keener, enjoy this.

08:02.291 --> 08:03.875
Ah!

08:03.959 --> 08:06.041
Excellent technique, Mr. Duncan.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.083
But if you use your soup spoon,
you can have twice the enjoyment.

08:10.417 --> 08:11.458
Oh!

08:13.834 --> 08:15.500
I believe I'll give that a try.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.083
All right, all right.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.583
Who did that?

08:32.709 --> 08:34.041
Oh, what are you doing?

08:34.542 --> 08:37.250
Well, since I'm no longer
talking to your mother,

08:37.333 --> 08:39.166
I figured I'd sleep down here tonight.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.083
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll be all right.

08:42.458 --> 08:43.583
I'm talking to the couch.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.417
Next time you need
your car insurance paid...

08:49.583 --> 08:50.750
talk to the couch.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.000
Uh,

08:53.542 --> 08:54.667
so,

08:54.750 --> 08:55.709
Dad...

08:55.792 --> 08:59.208
Are you and Mom still planning on going
to that hotel tomorrow night?

08:59.291 --> 09:01.291
Not unless she apologizes.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.917
She will be doing nothing of the sort.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.875
- I thought you weren't talking to me.
- I wasn't.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.250
- You just did.
- So did you.

09:11.542 --> 09:14.083
Well, this is nice.
You've got a dialogue going.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.083
- Oaf.
- Lunatic.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.375
Oh, PJ, this is bad.

09:21.959 --> 09:24.583
If they don't go to the hotel tomorrow
night, then we can't have our party.

09:24.959 --> 09:26.041
Unless...

09:26.458 --> 09:27.667
Unless what?

09:27.750 --> 09:28.834
Unless they...

09:29.959 --> 09:30.917
Unless they what?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.333
I got the ball rolling here.
I can't think of everything.

09:38.542 --> 09:41.375
Step and turn and dip,

09:41.792 --> 09:43.458
and done.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.458
Now, let's have a couple
of students on the floor

09:48.542 --> 09:50.041
to demonstrate the position.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.250
How about....

09:52.083 --> 09:54.250
the melon launchers?

09:57.834 --> 10:00.375
Now, the gentleman, or in this case...

10:00.875 --> 10:01.959
you...

10:02.750 --> 10:04.792
holds his left hand thusly,

10:05.792 --> 10:07.166
and his right hand,

10:07.709 --> 10:09.583
around the lady's waist.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.834
All right, now move in a little closer.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.917
She's not going to bite.

10:14.542 --> 10:16.166
Yes, but she will punch and kick.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.500
It's true. I do that.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.667
Move a little closer.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.041
Closer! There you go.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.250
All right, gentlemen,
please address your partners.

10:29.875 --> 10:30.875
This is weird.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
It's not so weird.

10:33.959 --> 10:34.959
You like it?

10:36.500 --> 10:37.709
Yeah, kinda.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.458
Ew!

10:39.834 --> 10:41.041
You like it.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.041
So?

10:42.125 --> 10:43.583
So, it's gross.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.500
I don't wanna be your boyfriend.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.417
Well, I don't wanna be your girlfriend.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.625
- Good!
- Good!

10:48.709 --> 10:50.041
- I'm outta here.
- Jo: Fine!

10:52.875 --> 10:54.417
Don't worry. He'll be back.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.041
They always come back.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.333
And regret it for the rest of their lives.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.875
Look, Dad.

11:09.834 --> 11:10.709
I know you're right.

11:10.792 --> 11:11.959
And I know you're right.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.166
But at the end of the day
would you rather be right...

11:15.709 --> 11:17.083
Or would you rather be happy?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.250
- Well--
- Happy.

11:21.583 --> 11:22.625
The answer's happy.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.750
All you have to do is just
apologize to Mom.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.500
And if you can't do it for yourself...

11:31.792 --> 11:33.333
do it for the kids.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.583
All right, maybe you're right.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.291
- Attaboy, Dad.
- Oh!

11:43.375 --> 11:44.792
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.417
And besides, you should be used
to apologizing to Mom by now.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.750
You've done it like 100 times.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.208
I have, haven't I?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.625
That makes the score Mom 100, Dad nothing.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.041
Dad, I said like 100 to nothing.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.083
Maybe it's 200 to nothing, we don't know.

12:06.917 --> 12:09.208
Don't listen to him, just go, go, go!

12:09.250 --> 12:10.333
For the kids.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.542
I'm not apologizing.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.625
I'm right.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.166
And you know what? After today,

12:18.500 --> 12:20.291
the score is going to be Mom 100,

12:20.792 --> 12:23.208
Dad... one!

12:26.959 --> 12:28.583
What... what just happened here?

12:28.667 --> 12:31.208
You blew it. You started using numbers.

12:32.291 --> 12:33.709
Stupid Math.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.792
Now, we're gonna have to cancel the party.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.250
No, we can't do that. It's too late.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.000
I'll just have to talk to Mom
and get her to apologize.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.250
It won't be easy,
but I can do it. Fortunately...

12:44.333 --> 12:46.000
- We have a special bond.
- Hmm.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.166
- Mom--
- I'm not apologizing.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.417
Good night.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.458
Okay, PJ, try one more time.

12:59.542 --> 13:00.875
Okay, Charlie, what's the matter?

13:01.375 --> 13:02.333
I'm sad.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.000
Why are you sad, Charlie?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.500
Mommy and Daddy fight.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.500
Yes, good job, Charlie.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.166
Just try not to say it with a smile.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.208
You're sad. Let us feel your pain.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.375
Oh... She's two.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.083
So, she can't give us a good performance?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.667
All right, Charlie, work your magic,
so we can have our party.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.417
- All right.
- Okay.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.041
- Come on.
- Okay.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.250
Mom, Dad, get in here!

13:27.583 --> 13:29.333
- What's going on?
- Everything okay?

13:29.667 --> 13:31.542
Well, Charlie seems very upset.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.959
Charlie, tell Mommy and Daddy
what's the matter.

13:34.458 --> 13:35.458
Party.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.250
Party!

13:38.917 --> 13:40.458
Um, why does she keep saying party?

13:42.083 --> 13:44.125
Uh, just stop focusing
on what she just said.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.542
Focus on what she said before,

13:47.041 --> 13:48.458
which was,

13:48.542 --> 13:51.083
"I sad. Mommy and Daddy fight."

13:51.583 --> 13:52.667
Yeah, and then she said,

13:52.750 --> 13:57.041
"I just wish they'd make up and go
to the romantic suite at the hotel."

13:59.333 --> 14:00.375
You said all that?

14:00.709 --> 14:01.792
Party!

14:11.542 --> 14:13.250
Hi, welcome to the party.

14:13.834 --> 14:14.959
Little change of plans.

14:15.041 --> 14:17.291
You wanna go around the house
to that window over there,

14:17.375 --> 14:18.792
and climb in through the basement.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.417
My mom and dad are home.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.041
So, this is going to be a quiet party.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.875
We're not gonna make any noise.

14:24.709 --> 14:25.917
Now, go have fun.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.083
Hi! Little change of plans.

14:41.333 --> 14:42.542
Amy?

14:46.166 --> 14:47.333
Yes, Bob?

14:52.417 --> 14:53.667
Where's the couch?

14:54.625 --> 14:56.542
Oh, that old thing
you've been sleeping on?

14:58.542 --> 15:00.041
I sent it out to be cleaned.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.959
You know, usually when they clean
a couch, they...

15:05.542 --> 15:07.083
clean it when it's still in the home.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.291
Well, Couch Cleaners To Go takes it...

15:12.375 --> 15:13.250
to go.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.291
Guess they have
some sort of special process.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.250
Very well, I guess I'll be sleeping
on the couch in the basement then.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.417
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.375
They were having a two-for-one special.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.291
You think you're so smart.
There's an air mattress in the garage.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.166
Popped it!

15:48.000 --> 15:50.125
Hey! Hey, party animals.

15:50.625 --> 15:53.166
Here's a pen and paper.
Chat amongst yourselves.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.166
Okay.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.291
What?

15:58.417 --> 16:00.542
What did I say? Vibrate only!

16:02.583 --> 16:03.709
Emmett! Emmett!

16:04.208 --> 16:05.458
Take the change out of your pockets.

16:05.542 --> 16:06.667
Oh, right.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.625
Oh!

16:11.500 --> 16:12.750
Dad's coming!

16:12.834 --> 16:14.834
Everybody into my room. Go, go, go.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.041
Go, go, go!

16:17.166 --> 16:19.125
Aah!

16:26.959 --> 16:28.250
Everything okay down here?

16:29.041 --> 16:30.166
Yeah, we're fine.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.041
I mean, yeah, we're fine.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.834
I thought I heard noises.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.041
No, no.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.875
No. No noises down here, Dad.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.709
Just the sound of a brother and sister
getting along.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.375
Ow.

16:50.583 --> 16:51.500
Hey, hon... what?

16:51.583 --> 16:53.041
Why aren't you dressed for cotillion?

16:53.834 --> 16:55.709
I'm not going. Jo and I had a fight.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.125
What happened?

16:57.375 --> 16:59.542
They made us dance really close.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.458
And she liked it.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.250
It was gross.

17:04.709 --> 17:05.583
Well,

17:06.250 --> 17:08.083
one day you'll feel different.

17:09.166 --> 17:12.291
Then 20 years will go by,
and it will be gross all over again.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.750
Gabe, Jo's here.

17:28.834 --> 17:29.875
Gabe!

17:30.333 --> 17:31.333
I'm sorry, what?

17:31.417 --> 17:34.166
I said give me my stupid flower, stupid.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.083
Wow.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.875
Not so gross now, huh?

17:47.083 --> 17:48.375
Just wait.

18:01.417 --> 18:04.000
Is there anything I can get you,
Miss Keener?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.875
I mean besides a refund...

18:06.333 --> 18:07.500
which I can't get you.

18:10.542 --> 18:12.041
I'm just here to pass the class.

18:16.417 --> 18:17.792
Good evening, Miss Keener.

18:18.875 --> 18:20.166
What are you doing here, stupid?

18:21.417 --> 18:22.625
May I have this dance?

18:56.417 --> 18:57.333
Thanks.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.542
That was... okay.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.458
Dinner, everyone, dinner.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.917
- I have a surprise for you.
- Really? What is it?

19:13.583 --> 19:15.542
I put some earthworms
into Mrs. Krump's salad

19:15.625 --> 19:18.333
and she should be
finding them right about...

19:21.750 --> 19:22.917
...now.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.750
Oh, Miss Keener,

19:25.959 --> 19:28.083
you are a delight.

19:32.375 --> 19:33.125
Amy: Bob!

19:34.250 --> 19:35.542
Where is he?

19:40.959 --> 19:43.041
What? For heaven's sakes.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.542
What are you doing?

19:59.875 --> 20:01.792
Fine. I'm sorry, okay?

20:02.709 --> 20:03.667
Bob: What's that?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.208
I didn't hear you.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.959
Don't make me say it again.

20:08.417 --> 20:11.125
No, no, no. I mean
I... I really didn't hear you.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.583
I think my ears froze.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.083
I'm sorry.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.083
I was wrong, and...

20:19.667 --> 20:23.083
I behaved badly in the grocery store
and I shouldn't have embarrassed you.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.083
Man, this is hard.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.500
I don't know how you've done it 162 times.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.875
It's because I love you.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.500
Mmm...

20:35.583 --> 20:36.583
I love you.

20:36.667 --> 20:37.834
Okay. Come here.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.041
Come here.

20:43.291 --> 20:44.542
Um...

20:45.125 --> 20:47.333
You know there's a secret party
going on downstairs?

20:47.417 --> 20:48.625
Yeah, of course I do.

20:49.709 --> 20:51.458
You know we're gonna have to punish them?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.917
I'm way ahead of you.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.458
Mom, Dad, we get it.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.750
Okay? We're sorry.
We'll never do it again.

21:01.959 --> 21:03.542
Haven't we been punished enough?

21:03.834 --> 21:06.041
- Amy: Sprinkler?
- Oh, sprinkler, yes, definitely.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.500
No!

21:16.792 --> 21:17.875
Hi, Charlie.

21:17.959 --> 21:18.834
So...

21:18.917 --> 21:20.250
Finally tried doing something bad.

21:21.041 --> 21:22.417
Didn't turn out so good.

21:23.333 --> 21:24.417
I got punished.

21:25.166 --> 21:26.041
Running man.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.291
Running man?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.208
Yep, and I'm still being punished.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.000
So, always try and be
a good girl, because if not...

21:39.083 --> 21:40.750
- Well--
- Gooseneck!

21:42.166 --> 21:43.041
Yeah.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.250
Good luck, Charlie.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.458
So elegant,

21:53.375 --> 21:54.625
so poised.

21:54.709 --> 21:56.959
Such sophistication.

21:57.208 --> 21:59.792
Our finest pupil ever, Mrs. Krump.

22:09.875 --> 22:10.917
Uh-oh.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.375
She's the last of the Duncan kids,
right, Mrs. Krump?

22:21.041 --> 22:23.125
One can only hope, Mr. Krump.
