WEBVTT

00:00.451 --> 00:02.301
Then I accept your job offer.

00:02.421 --> 00:04.564
Enuka Okimba. Our new virologist.

00:04.685 --> 00:07.009
You mean the new virologist
who wasn't cleared by security?

00:07.173 --> 00:09.952
Didn't have to be vetted
by any of our 3 governing bodies?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.455
May you share everything with Bob.

00:12.635 --> 00:14.457
Someone had to be the first volunteer.

00:14.637 --> 00:18.228
- You've had this procedure done?
- I have a heightened sense of empathy.

00:18.852 --> 00:22.191
I have a daughter at Sick Kids.
I gave her up for adoption.

00:22.354 --> 00:24.777
You should contact the father.
Are you still in touch with him?

00:24.940 --> 00:27.350
- Are you the specialist?
- I'm the father.

00:27.470 --> 00:31.200
We were hoping, after,
you could still be a part of her life.

00:31.363 --> 00:33.704
If humans follow the same timeline
as the monkeys,

00:33.824 --> 00:35.358
in a week, possibly two,

00:35.478 --> 00:38.040
Nina may begin to experience
the same violent tendencies.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.719
No! No!

00:45.478 --> 00:46.215
Bob.

00:46.377 --> 00:47.741
Nina's on the edge here.

00:47.861 --> 00:50.469
She needs to be someplace
where she won't harm herself

00:50.632 --> 00:51.932
or anybody else.

00:57.604 --> 00:59.154
... Now Profound Joe,

00:59.335 --> 01:02.735
he knowed not to go down to the river
when the moon full.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.898
He knowed
'cause his daddy seen the River Cat

01:07.227 --> 01:09.358
layin' low under the bridge

01:09.641 --> 01:11.461
waitin' fo' the moon full.

01:12.117 --> 01:13.113
Waitin'

01:13.547 --> 01:15.691
for the little ones to come by...

01:16.505 --> 01:18.464
Now Profound Joe,
he told his little ones.

01:18.584 --> 01:20.541
Yes he did. Yes he did.

01:21.241 --> 01:22.751
But that little Lisa Jane,

01:23.825 --> 01:25.087
she don't listen.

01:25.673 --> 01:28.736
Stubborn little,
who didn't think she was.

01:29.416 --> 01:30.718
One night,

01:31.042 --> 01:32.640
when the moon full,

01:33.033 --> 01:36.404
she decided to go down to the river
to see fo' herself.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.684
And Profound Joe,

01:38.848 --> 01:42.196
with his gun in his arms,
he went a-runnin' to find her.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.732
He was a-runnin' and a-runnin'.

01:44.895 --> 01:46.626
Runnin' and a-runnin'.

01:47.782 --> 01:49.521
And when he found her...

01:51.371 --> 01:53.025
Mercy, what a sight.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.444
Lisa Jane,

01:56.053 --> 01:58.227
she be layin' under the bridge

01:59.183 --> 02:03.058
white as the calla lilies
they throw'd on her grave the next day.

02:04.145 --> 02:07.838
Every drop of blood gone from her body

02:08.673 --> 02:10.215
into the belly

02:10.377 --> 02:11.490
of the River Cat

02:12.108 --> 02:14.219
that lay under the bridge,

02:14.530 --> 02:16.638
waiting fo' a little one to come by

02:17.348 --> 02:18.793
when the moon full.

02:25.397 --> 02:27.816
My goodness, what do have we here?

02:29.084 --> 02:30.220
A full moon.

02:41.597 --> 02:44.023
It used to scare the shit out of us.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.589
Jamila said,

02:45.709 --> 02:49.505
- she even saw the River Cat one night.
- She's making the whole thing up?

02:49.668 --> 02:50.839
I don't know.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.760
I haven't talked to her yet.

02:53.208 --> 02:56.470
But Randy,
her truck driving shit of a husband,

02:56.633 --> 02:57.645
he's thinking

02:57.765 --> 03:00.415
that she's just screwing with the system
before the custody hearing.

03:00.535 --> 03:02.563
Telling everybody
that your kid was dragged off

03:02.683 --> 03:04.960
by a fanged creature
isn't screwing with the system.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.636
That's fucking crazy.

03:07.911 --> 03:10.449
She just,
she does things like this, David.

03:10.730 --> 03:14.363
Well, clearly she's got the kid
hidden somewhere, right?

03:14.652 --> 03:15.697
Maybe.

03:18.592 --> 03:20.092
So what are you gonna do?

03:20.212 --> 03:23.035
I'm gonna go there, find her,
tell her to grow up.

03:23.155 --> 03:24.623
Quit playing games.

03:25.196 --> 03:26.591
When do you leave?

03:27.025 --> 03:28.544
First thing in the morning.

03:28.777 --> 03:30.295
Who's covering for you?

03:30.593 --> 03:31.505
Carlos.

03:32.167 --> 03:35.259
Okay. Well, have a nice trip.
I mean, you know...

03:39.618 --> 03:40.430
No.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.333
Please, will you watch Louis?

03:44.817 --> 03:46.247
Please, David.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.305
Just, just for a few days.

03:51.350 --> 03:54.392
And I promise I will be in my own place
when I get back.

03:55.004 --> 03:56.013
Promise?

03:56.672 --> 03:57.647
Promise.

03:59.013 --> 03:59.981
Alright.

04:06.737 --> 04:08.938
- I don't hear anything.
- Me neither.

04:11.868 --> 04:13.655
I should check this. Hang on.

04:15.763 --> 04:17.487
It's Bob, I gotta take this.

04:17.607 --> 04:18.468
What?

04:19.183 --> 04:20.753
Bob, slow down.

04:22.351 --> 04:23.312
Yeah.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.183
When? When?

04:27.440 --> 04:29.360
- What time is it?
- Midnight.

04:29.627 --> 04:30.538
Bob.

04:31.323 --> 04:32.949
I understand, take it easy.

04:33.069 --> 04:34.402
I'm on my way.

04:34.725 --> 04:35.525
Right.

04:36.393 --> 04:39.267
- What?
- Nina's got a blood clot or something.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.089
Oh shit.

04:41.832 --> 04:44.762
They don't think
she's gonna make it through the night.

06:37.123 --> 06:37.992
Hello.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.069
How's she doing?

06:42.997 --> 06:44.573
David, I want to marry her.

06:46.419 --> 06:47.793
Yeah, I know, Bob.

06:47.913 --> 06:51.580
And then we're gonna buy a house,
and we're gonna get a puppy.

06:51.858 --> 06:54.006
And Nina's gonna have a vegetable garden

06:54.126 --> 06:56.274
because she loves to garden.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.054
And...

07:07.262 --> 07:09.210
Why is this happening, David?

07:09.771 --> 07:11.272
Why can't we fix it?

07:12.471 --> 07:13.608
We will, Bob.

07:15.338 --> 07:16.292
We will.

07:16.699 --> 07:20.192
The neurologist said the next
24 hours for her are critical.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.839
I did this to her.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.313
No, Bob, no.

07:28.003 --> 07:29.381
I was playing God,

07:29.501 --> 07:31.406
I was manipulating
the human species.

07:31.526 --> 07:34.109
I have no right
to call myself a scientist...

07:34.452 --> 07:35.934
You are a scientist.

07:37.476 --> 07:38.930
- A bad one.
- No.

07:39.331 --> 07:40.629
A bad one gives up.

07:41.486 --> 07:42.902
Lets the virus win.

07:45.192 --> 07:46.916
I don't know what to do.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.193
You pray.

07:51.409 --> 07:52.748
And you curse.

07:52.868 --> 07:54.476
And you hold her hand.

07:54.949 --> 07:56.585
You get her through the night.

07:56.953 --> 07:59.869
- You just get her though the night.
- It's hard.

08:01.354 --> 08:02.406
Look at me.

08:04.356 --> 08:06.177
You never give up.

08:09.987 --> 08:10.927
Okay.

08:15.889 --> 08:16.899
Thank you.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.277
I'd appreciate it
if you kept me informed along the way.

08:34.397 --> 08:35.885
Well, thanks Doctor.

08:38.611 --> 08:39.551
Carl?

08:41.486 --> 08:43.280
What the hell are you doing here?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.239
I heard about the young woman.

08:45.537 --> 08:47.737
- Heard about? From who?
- How is she?

08:48.959 --> 08:50.532
How are your boys holding up?

08:51.800 --> 08:52.742
How is she?

08:53.132 --> 08:54.476
Do you know her?

08:54.656 --> 08:57.570
- I heard she had a psychotic episode.
- Yeah. I guess you could say that.

08:57.690 --> 08:59.457
Were you able to correct the condition?

08:59.577 --> 09:00.585
Why the interest?

09:00.705 --> 09:02.335
I'm interested in everything at NorBAC.

09:02.455 --> 09:03.670
Generally for a reason.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.463
Were you able to correct her condition?

09:06.566 --> 09:07.990
We're working on it.

09:09.437 --> 09:10.256
Right.

09:10.746 --> 09:12.953
Well, I'd like to be kept up-to-date
on her progress.

09:13.073 --> 09:14.389
Yeah, you and who else?

09:17.312 --> 09:19.936
Still having trouble
finding Roth for me, Carl?

09:21.717 --> 09:23.189
We're working on it.

09:25.159 --> 09:26.155
Asshole.

09:46.091 --> 09:46.930
Jamila?

09:53.142 --> 09:54.268
What is it?

09:57.296 --> 09:58.327
What is it?

10:00.167 --> 10:01.468
They found him.

10:03.949 --> 10:05.275
They found Billy.

10:06.251 --> 10:07.642
Oh my God...

10:26.649 --> 10:28.946
We walked up the creek to the falls.

10:31.243 --> 10:33.188
Billy went down to the water.

10:36.211 --> 10:38.018
I was getting our snack...

10:40.137 --> 10:41.101
It's okay...

10:42.715 --> 10:44.332
I heard him scream.

10:46.948 --> 10:48.823
And I ran down to the creek.

10:52.796 --> 10:54.108
I saw it, Enuka.

10:55.198 --> 10:56.651
Dragging him off...

10:57.062 --> 10:58.304
I'm so sorry.

11:01.487 --> 11:03.034
It was the River Cat.

11:06.020 --> 11:06.856
No, honey.

11:07.825 --> 11:10.338
- That was only a story grammy told us.
- I swear, Enuka,

11:10.501 --> 11:11.341
I saw it.

11:12.808 --> 11:16.794
- Baby, maybe it was a mountain lion...
- I know what it looks like!

11:17.971 --> 11:19.611
It wasn't a mountain lion.

11:21.369 --> 11:22.541
Okay? Its...

11:23.408 --> 11:25.119
Its teeth were huge.

11:27.147 --> 11:28.326
And his eyes...

11:28.869 --> 11:30.650
And his eyes were on fire.

11:34.046 --> 11:36.442
- It was the River Cat, Enuka.
- Honey...

11:40.656 --> 11:42.537
Why can't you just believe me?

11:46.332 --> 11:48.535
- I can't see anybody.
- Okay, okay.

11:57.332 --> 11:58.386
Jamila Thompson?

11:59.187 --> 12:00.375
I'm her sister.

12:00.495 --> 12:01.598
Enuka Okimba.

12:01.957 --> 12:04.142
I'd like to speak with Jamila Thompson.

12:04.305 --> 12:06.333
She's resting. She just lost her child.

12:06.453 --> 12:07.729
Yes, I am aware of that.

12:08.111 --> 12:09.306
May I come in?

12:15.801 --> 12:17.322
Are you Jamila Thompson?

12:18.074 --> 12:19.991
- Yes I am.
- What's this about?

12:20.347 --> 12:22.994
We have some information
from the coroner's office.

12:23.629 --> 12:26.190
You say this attack occurred up
near Harbor Creek Falls about,

12:26.310 --> 12:27.499
what time was that?

12:28.896 --> 12:30.372
I don't know...

12:30.575 --> 12:31.970
6:30? 7:00?

12:33.125 --> 12:34.631
How long did you look for him?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.740
Till it was dark.

12:37.527 --> 12:39.283
I couldn't see anything...

12:41.022 --> 12:42.013
Mrs. Thompson.

12:42.546 --> 12:45.616
We found the boy's body
within a hundred yards of the falls.

12:45.736 --> 12:47.477
You want to tell me how you missed him?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.046
It was dark!

12:50.843 --> 12:52.015
I don't know...

12:54.300 --> 12:55.693
It was the River Cat.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.405
The River Cat carried Billy off.

12:59.501 --> 13:03.034
And you got a real good look
at this "River Cat," did you?

13:03.368 --> 13:04.329
Yes!

13:06.860 --> 13:08.897
What are you saying? I mean...

13:10.468 --> 13:12.601
Why you questioning me like this?

13:13.075 --> 13:16.214
I think we can talk about that
down at the station house.

13:51.604 --> 13:53.442
The point is she's stable for now.

13:53.562 --> 13:55.920
Do they have any idea
what caused the clot?

13:56.083 --> 13:58.197
No, they think
her dopamine levels spiked.

13:58.317 --> 13:59.824
They think it's tied to that.

13:59.944 --> 14:03.511
We know that Bob's stem cells are tied
to the increased dopamine levels.

14:04.561 --> 14:06.108
Fucking stem cells!

14:10.482 --> 14:12.187
We have to get rid of the stem cells.

14:13.559 --> 14:16.538
We've been going after the dopamine.
But if we wipe out the stem cells...

14:16.658 --> 14:18.071
away goes the dopamine.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.218
- And then Nina becomes sane again?
- Yeah.

14:23.450 --> 14:24.572
How's she doing?

14:24.692 --> 14:25.486
Better.

14:25.606 --> 14:26.823
How are you doing?

14:29.366 --> 14:31.024
We're all in agreement here, Bob.

14:31.144 --> 14:34.167
We need to destroy the stem cells
that activated Nina's Jacobson organ.

14:36.014 --> 14:36.753
I see.

14:38.401 --> 14:39.756
And how do we do that?

14:43.321 --> 14:44.125
Okay.

14:46.381 --> 14:47.722
This all started

14:48.517 --> 14:49.891
when we sent a

14:50.749 --> 14:51.997
growth hormone

14:53.449 --> 14:54.901
up the optic nerve

14:55.117 --> 14:57.277
on the back of a herpes virus.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.738
But instead, it integrating
to the DNA of Bob's Jacobson's organ.

15:00.858 --> 15:01.659
Right.

15:01.779 --> 15:03.471
So we have to wipe out the DNA.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.696
Or...

15:06.156 --> 15:09.771
- we can wipe out the herpes virus.
- Either one, they're both connected.

15:09.891 --> 15:11.625
Herpes virus is a bigger target.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.180
Okay, you kill the virus
while it's replicating.

15:14.745 --> 15:17.585
Okay, well,
herpes replicates due to stress,

15:17.748 --> 15:19.254
pH imbalance, injury.

15:19.374 --> 15:21.546
I've been stressed lately,
nothing seems to be happening.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.841
Some people get cold sores
when they're stressed...

15:24.004 --> 15:27.345
- I've never had a cold sore.
- Ultraviolet can trigger cold sores...

15:27.507 --> 15:29.455
Hard to get an ultraviolet light
in Nina's head.

15:29.575 --> 15:32.203
No look, the virus went in
through the optic nerve

15:32.323 --> 15:34.078
if it's gonna come out...

15:36.355 --> 15:38.690
Bob, how's your eye been feeling lately?
Any infections?

15:39.498 --> 15:41.484
- Nope.
- Irritations? Sensitivity?

15:43.955 --> 15:44.988
Last week...

15:46.322 --> 15:48.736
I thought it was just
because I was tired.

15:49.196 --> 15:51.286
My right eye was itchy a little.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.037
What were you doing last week?

15:53.386 --> 15:56.805
I was at the Adele Seward Foundation
the week before.

15:56.925 --> 15:58.543
Fucking hyperbaric chamber.

16:00.721 --> 16:02.380
Wait. There it is.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.198
Hyperbaric chamber.

16:05.526 --> 16:10.026
Pressurized oxygen gets into his brain,
could cause oxidative stress,

16:10.146 --> 16:12.390
that could make the herpes virus
pop out of the DNA.

16:12.552 --> 16:13.748
Then we can kill it.

16:13.868 --> 16:15.555
Sure. That's worth a try.

16:18.430 --> 16:19.230
Sure.

16:23.757 --> 16:25.903
Wound was a clan puncture
into the jugular.

16:26.169 --> 16:28.181
Ice pick. Maybe a screwdriver.

16:29.962 --> 16:31.159
Are you alright?

16:33.573 --> 16:34.471
Could you...

16:35.599 --> 16:36.393
Sure.

16:39.205 --> 16:39.932
So,

16:40.459 --> 16:42.378
could it have been
an animal that did this?

16:43.229 --> 16:44.612
I'm not ruling it out.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.842
I mean, I guess you could say
we got some anomalies here.

16:48.385 --> 16:49.182
Like?

16:49.756 --> 16:52.793
Like when I opened up the boy,
I only found one pint of blood.

16:53.227 --> 16:56.257
Boy his size and weight
should have three or four quarts.

16:56.488 --> 16:58.884
But the jugular was punctured.
That would explain...

16:59.004 --> 17:01.689
Sure, the blood should have been found
on the ground but...

17:02.569 --> 17:04.525
I don't know
if you want to look at these...

17:06.507 --> 17:08.529
These are photos
of where they found the boy.

17:08.692 --> 17:10.435
- No...
- Yeah. Right.

17:11.361 --> 17:12.803
Well, point is

17:14.040 --> 17:16.076
there wasn't any blood on the ground.

17:16.195 --> 17:18.981
Stabbing didn't happen in that spot.

17:20.128 --> 17:22.800
So what if he was dragged
by a mountain lion or a coyote.

17:22.921 --> 17:24.337
Couple of problems there.

17:24.499 --> 17:25.413
Sheriff said,

17:25.532 --> 17:28.508
"Didn't find any drag marks
or any blood trails."

17:28.670 --> 17:30.731
And if it was an animal that did this,

17:30.851 --> 17:32.053
cat or coyote,

17:32.609 --> 17:34.437
why didn't it eat its prey?

17:34.836 --> 17:37.183
So you don't think
it could have been an animal.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.001
I guess it could have been scared off.

17:46.417 --> 17:47.597
Thanks, Doctor.

17:52.479 --> 17:53.324
Miss Okimba.

17:53.887 --> 17:56.221
There's one other thing.
Something that might just prove

17:56.341 --> 17:58.454
that your sister is telling the truth

17:58.617 --> 18:00.305
about an animal attack.

18:20.201 --> 18:20.977
What?

18:21.373 --> 18:22.733
David, thank you.

18:23.267 --> 18:24.416
Thank Mayko.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.420
She call the Senator. You should have
the keys to the city by now.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.047
- Believe me, I do.
- So what's going on?

18:30.167 --> 18:32.049
No witnesses, circumstantial evidence,

18:32.169 --> 18:34.647
and they don't want to believe
anything she's saying.

18:34.767 --> 18:37.201
- How's she doing?
- They questioned her and sent her home.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.119
They can't look at this kid
and tell a bite mark from a screwdriver?

18:40.239 --> 18:40.997
<i>Get this:</i>

18:41.416 --> 18:44.098
the coroner found some hair fibers
under Billy's fingernails

18:44.218 --> 18:47.256
and they sent it up
to the Austin Crime Lab for a DNA test.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.786
They said no roots just hair stalks,
void of DNA.

18:49.906 --> 18:52.751
- Said the hair couldn't tell anything.
- That's bullshit. Sure they can.

18:52.871 --> 18:55.386
No, you need the roots
of the hair to get a DNA read, David.

18:56.248 --> 18:58.190
Tom Gilbert, University of Copenhagen.

18:58.310 --> 19:02.210
He's been working on DNA from mammoths
they dug up from the permafrost.

19:02.330 --> 19:05.112
Apparently, the hair shaft's
keratin acts like a natural plastic

19:05.232 --> 19:07.857
protecting the mitochondrial
DNA from degradation.

19:08.373 --> 19:09.602
Do you think you could...

19:09.722 --> 19:12.028
You get me some of those hair samples,
I'll see what I can do.

19:12.808 --> 19:14.054
Okay, I'm on it.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.168
Nina.

19:20.721 --> 19:22.182
If the chamber works,

19:22.706 --> 19:24.332
if the virus starts replicating,

19:24.973 --> 19:27.335
then we can kill it with the antivirals.

19:27.518 --> 19:30.213
- You don't have to test it on yourself.
- Yes I do.

19:30.397 --> 19:33.982
We have to make sure that what we're
trying is safe before we give it to you.

19:35.187 --> 19:37.187
You're going to turn off your...

19:39.025 --> 19:40.356
I've been thinking.

19:40.967 --> 19:44.197
I mean, maybe,
there's a reason it stopped

19:44.801 --> 19:46.729
working as we evolved.

19:47.872 --> 19:49.273
You don't believe that.

19:50.499 --> 19:53.277
You're not supposed to know
that I don't believe that.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.322
I love you, Bob.

19:57.746 --> 20:00.609
I don't need any special senses
to believe that, Nina.

20:02.559 --> 20:03.788
I love you too.

20:05.901 --> 20:06.975
Go to sleep.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.377
I want you to go home.

20:09.497 --> 20:11.052
You need your rest too.

20:15.122 --> 20:16.300
I'm with you.

20:21.121 --> 20:22.696
I am home, Nina.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.245
There you go...

20:29.257 --> 20:30.063
Rest.

20:52.755 --> 20:54.469
You're back. What happened?

20:56.742 --> 20:58.145
Your sister hit me.

20:58.894 --> 21:00.678
What?! Where is she?

21:01.859 --> 21:02.930
I don't know.

21:03.114 --> 21:04.515
What did you do to her, Randy?

21:05.056 --> 21:06.767
Get off it, Enuka. I didn't do nothin'.

21:06.951 --> 21:08.438
Why did she hit you?

21:08.558 --> 21:09.904
Your sister's sick.

21:11.205 --> 21:13.004
If you don't think
she did this to my boy...

21:13.124 --> 21:16.390
- She didn't do anything to Billy.
- You don't know her anymore.

21:19.519 --> 21:20.996
I ain't moved out yet.

21:23.308 --> 21:24.092
Hello?

21:26.666 --> 21:27.580
No she's not.

21:29.969 --> 21:31.328
Haven't got a clue.

21:34.673 --> 21:35.676
Yeah, sure,

21:36.733 --> 21:38.405
I see her, I'll tell her.

21:41.059 --> 21:42.053
Who was it?

21:42.494 --> 21:44.764
Somebody down at the Sheriff's office.

21:45.957 --> 21:48.210
Said a local shot some kind of animal.

21:48.996 --> 21:50.672
Wants Jamila to take a look at it.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.605
So they think she's telling the truth.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.215
- Randy, where is she?
- I said I don't know.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.092
We got talking about what happened.

22:00.247 --> 22:02.052
She turned it into a fight,

22:02.947 --> 22:04.096
walked out the door...

22:05.390 --> 22:07.868
Do you really think
she could kill your son?

22:08.806 --> 22:09.795
She said

22:10.307 --> 22:13.575
she'd rather see Billy dead
than giving him up to me...

22:16.310 --> 22:18.089
What do you want me to believe?

22:28.855 --> 22:30.768
Alright. You wanted hair, you got hair.

22:30.930 --> 22:33.069
Austin PD's sending it.
It'll be here in the morning.

22:33.189 --> 22:34.016
Thanks.

22:34.246 --> 22:35.398
Just doing my job.

22:37.350 --> 22:38.470
Wait a minute.

22:40.016 --> 22:41.320
Did you hear about Hannah?

22:42.582 --> 22:44.730
Sounds like the bone marrow transplant
went really well.

22:44.850 --> 22:46.499
She could go home in a few weeks.

22:46.619 --> 22:48.484
Yeah, no, I heard. It's good.

22:51.081 --> 22:53.624
I was gonna get her something.
I don't know, from the two of us.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.568
Okay...

22:58.642 --> 23:01.507
Well, I was...
I was thinking of a savings bond.

23:01.884 --> 23:04.343
You know, we could start
something now for her university.

23:04.527 --> 23:07.638
- Stupid. We should get her a bike.
- No, no, that's good.

23:08.918 --> 23:10.516
Yeah, I'll do that with you.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.478
Yeah?

23:19.590 --> 23:20.561
- Bob.
- David.

23:22.613 --> 23:23.942
I think it's time.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.786
- Jesus...
- No, Mayko, it's good.

23:31.163 --> 23:33.372
I think we may have
re-activated the virus.

23:34.307 --> 23:35.389
There it is.

23:36.744 --> 23:39.170
Just relax, Bob. Keep your eyes closed.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.191
It's okay, Louis.

23:44.180 --> 23:45.217
It's funny how...

23:45.599 --> 23:49.055
animals, dogs,
they worry so much about you.

23:52.675 --> 23:53.642
I'll be fine.

23:54.406 --> 23:56.353
How long
before the antiviral takes effect?

23:56.537 --> 24:00.117
If it acts like any other herpes
simplex, we should see results tomorrow.

24:00.862 --> 24:01.609
What?

24:01.929 --> 24:04.362
Some farmer shot something
down here this morning.

24:04.482 --> 24:06.469
- "Something"?
- Some kind of animal.

24:06.743 --> 24:08.817
I just got a look at it.
I don't know what it is,

24:08.937 --> 24:10.409
but it's hideous.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.258
Listen, I got an idea.

24:12.378 --> 24:15.164
I was able to get some tissue
from this thing,

24:15.368 --> 24:17.242
this animal down here, and I'm thinking,

24:17.362 --> 24:20.795
if we compare it to the hair sample,
that's as good as a smoking gun, right?

24:21.112 --> 24:24.184
If the DNA from the hair matches
the DNA from the tissue, yeah.

24:24.304 --> 24:25.004
<i>Good.</i>

24:25.149 --> 24:27.843
Well the hair sample's on its way.
It should be there by morning.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.309
How are you holding up?

24:29.429 --> 24:32.223
<i>I'm walking this line
between screaming and crying.</i>

24:32.585 --> 24:34.308
People here have their minds made up.

24:34.492 --> 24:37.341
Politics,
their religion, their prejudices.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.063
If you need anything...

24:39.246 --> 24:40.543
Thank you, David.

24:40.993 --> 24:43.567
I know this isn't
normal NorBAC business.

24:43.879 --> 24:45.192
Eh, what's normal?

24:54.055 --> 24:55.055
Hi, baby.

25:00.033 --> 25:01.749
They're beautiful...

25:03.635 --> 25:05.546
So are you ready to go?

25:06.607 --> 25:07.949
Where's your stuff?

25:08.243 --> 25:11.470
Dr. Bruen wants to talk to us
about the hyperbaric chamber.

25:11.654 --> 25:13.347
What's there to talk about? It works.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.145
It's gone.

25:18.611 --> 25:19.687
I'm sorry.

25:21.011 --> 25:22.309
No, it's good.

25:22.914 --> 25:24.317
It means we can

25:24.556 --> 25:25.481
help you.

25:26.127 --> 25:29.617
It means we can be together
for a long, long time.

25:32.472 --> 25:34.714
- How are we doing this morning?
- We're good.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.872
So, are we still on schedule to take
Nina to the Adele Seward Foundation?

25:38.913 --> 25:41.167
Actually,
there might be some complications...

25:42.360 --> 25:44.900
I don't understand.
We talked on the phone this morning.

25:45.182 --> 25:47.401
You know why it's important
we do this as soon as possible.

25:47.803 --> 25:48.546
Well,

25:48.932 --> 25:51.134
I agreed to the hyperbaric
chamber treatment

25:51.254 --> 25:54.555
before I had a chance
to look at Nina's functional MRI scans.

25:55.176 --> 25:57.653
We did a total cranial and body scan.

26:00.054 --> 26:01.704
Nina is 3 months pregnant.

26:08.991 --> 26:12.406
Now, everything looks good but there is
something I want you both to understand.

26:13.426 --> 26:17.365
There is conflicting documentation
on the effects of 100% oxygen

26:17.485 --> 26:20.271
at high atmospheric pressure
on fetal development.

26:28.851 --> 26:31.032
- Did you see this picture Enuka sent?
- I did.

26:31.192 --> 26:32.718
- What's this thing?
- A coyote.

26:32.926 --> 26:35.721
- This is not a coyote.
- It is, according to the DNA database.

26:36.594 --> 26:39.857
- What the hell happened to it?
- I'll have to do a physical examination

26:39.977 --> 26:41.936
but I suspect
the jaw line is a birth defect,

26:42.119 --> 26:44.104
canines overcompensating
for the under bite.

26:44.224 --> 26:45.148
And the hair?

26:45.408 --> 26:47.233
- You mean lack of it.
- Check it out.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.653
A parasite: <i>Cheyletiella Parasitivorax.</i>

26:50.858 --> 26:52.792
Irritates the skin,
causes the hair to fall out.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.990
It's a fur mite
that infests cats and dogs.

26:55.208 --> 26:56.617
- Coyotes?
- Absolutely.

26:57.002 --> 26:58.802
Well, now I know
what we're dealing with.

26:58.922 --> 27:00.367
Okay. Sequence the DNA

27:00.487 --> 27:02.327
- and see if we have a match.
- Sure.

27:03.070 --> 27:05.709
- I have to talk to you, it's important.
- What's wrong?

27:11.941 --> 27:15.177
Some reports say hyperbaric treatment
has no effect on developing foetus.

27:16.297 --> 27:19.358
Bob, you know as well as I do,
those studies aren't conclusive:

27:19.478 --> 27:22.877
non-randomized.
They're made with small sample sizes.

27:23.136 --> 27:27.062
But we can say
that there is nothing obvious,

27:27.284 --> 27:28.884
conclusive, or adverse

27:29.434 --> 27:30.442
in the effects.

27:31.581 --> 27:33.560
Yeah, you could say that.

27:35.255 --> 27:36.740
So you're saying we should do it.

27:38.842 --> 27:39.553
Yeah.

27:39.673 --> 27:40.959
No. No, Bob,

27:42.888 --> 27:44.832
we need to deal with the pregnancy.

27:45.787 --> 27:46.785
What do you mean?

27:49.713 --> 27:53.093
Bob, think about it. What if Nina
miscarries halfway through the dive?

27:53.213 --> 27:55.501
It'll take us at least half an hour
to decompress the chamber

27:55.621 --> 27:58.345
before we can get her out.
She could bleed to death.

27:58.529 --> 28:00.940
That's very unlikely, David. And she...

28:01.573 --> 28:03.684
We are willing to take that risk.

28:04.332 --> 28:05.853
Where is this coming from?

28:10.770 --> 28:13.870
- How are your daughters doing, David?
- Oh, Jesus!

28:14.240 --> 28:17.599
I'm looking forward to being a father
and raising a child so he'd grow up

28:17.719 --> 28:19.022
- to be...
- Bob! Stop it!

28:19.686 --> 28:21.336
It's human life, David.

28:21.456 --> 28:23.356
What about Nina's life, Bob?

28:24.678 --> 28:25.578
David...

28:27.783 --> 28:30.077
- Just give us a minute, alright?
- Sure.

28:30.197 --> 28:31.486
No, it's okay.

28:33.596 --> 28:34.646
We're done.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.304
We're going up to the hyperbaric
chamber this afternoon.

28:40.487 --> 28:43.138
I want this to work out
for you and Nina, I really do.

28:43.258 --> 28:45.358
I mean, this would've started...

28:46.916 --> 28:48.516
You saved my eyesight.

28:49.289 --> 28:50.838
Now let me save Nina.

28:53.427 --> 28:56.177
- Alright, I'll go with you.
- We'll be okay.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.253
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:07.506 --> 29:08.427
What's up?

29:12.264 --> 29:12.992
So,

29:13.690 --> 29:15.733
the hair samples
under the boy's fingernail,

29:15.853 --> 29:17.633
not a match to the coyote tissue.

29:19.332 --> 29:20.499
What are we looking at?

29:21.940 --> 29:24.120
We did a mitochondrial DNA analysis,

29:24.240 --> 29:26.392
compared it
with the Barcode of Life database...

29:27.668 --> 29:30.687
It clearly shows we're dealing
with an African Cheetah.

29:31.386 --> 29:32.488
In Texas?

29:33.684 --> 29:36.665
The Cheetah disappeared
from North America 10,000 years ago.

29:36.785 --> 29:38.112
I've checked the local zoos,

29:38.295 --> 29:40.531
private menageries,
there's no reports of anything missing.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.258
What the fuck is going on?

29:44.980 --> 29:48.648
<i>This the latest chapter in a sordid tale
that has sent shock waves</i>

29:48.768 --> 29:51.620
<i>throughout this community
of 1500 residents.</i>

29:51.740 --> 29:55.287
<i>Jamila Thompson pled not guilty today.
In the current county courthouse...</i>

29:55.407 --> 29:57.457
<i>My boy was killed by a monster!</i>

29:58.140 --> 30:00.167
<i>No bail was set
for Mrs. Thompson release.</i>

30:00.287 --> 30:04.208
<i>And Circuit Court judge, Walter Timmons,
ordered a psychological evaluation.</i>

30:05.726 --> 30:08.476
Now you wonder
why people think she's crazy?

30:12.660 --> 30:15.482
You know they ain't gonna
let me bury my son.

30:16.129 --> 30:18.871
Said they want
to "preserve the evidence".

30:20.371 --> 30:23.084
Never thought my little
boy's body would be...

30:23.204 --> 30:24.116
"evidence".

30:27.802 --> 30:29.329
What happened, Randy,

30:29.514 --> 30:30.914
to you and Jamila?

30:32.852 --> 30:34.094
What happened?

30:35.840 --> 30:36.990
I don't know.

30:38.980 --> 30:40.180
Maybe it's me.

30:40.503 --> 30:42.553
Being on the road all the time.

30:43.617 --> 30:47.085
Maybe Jamila just didn't wanna be
who she was no more.

30:48.796 --> 30:50.078
Didn't want me.

30:51.168 --> 30:52.563
I'm sorry, Randy.

30:53.793 --> 30:55.189
I'm really sorry.

31:08.728 --> 31:09.637
What is it?

31:09.757 --> 31:11.617
- Dr. Okimba?
- Dr. Winston.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.687
I think you might want
to take a look at this...

31:23.609 --> 31:26.654
Rancher who found it says he's lost
a couple other steers like this

31:26.774 --> 31:29.274
over the course of the last year or two.

31:31.854 --> 31:35.504
Just wrote it off as a mountain lion.
Never paid it much mind.

31:36.038 --> 31:38.514
Till all this about
the boy being killed.

31:41.475 --> 31:42.979
It's been attacked.

31:43.099 --> 31:45.290
The jugular punctured. Bloodless.

31:46.977 --> 31:48.408
Same as my boy.

31:50.031 --> 31:52.445
- Something's still out there.
- Could be.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.542
How do we convince the Sheriff?

31:58.352 --> 32:00.337
I thought you might be
interested in this.

32:01.282 --> 32:03.006
I took it right out of the steer's neck.

32:18.994 --> 32:21.733
- Why isn't it beeping?
- Just hold still, Nina.

32:22.285 --> 32:23.026
Bob?

32:24.406 --> 32:27.281
- It's okay.
- It's not okay. It's our baby.

32:30.418 --> 32:32.703
Sometimes it's just hard
to find the heartbeat.

32:33.102 --> 32:35.330
- But it's in there.
- Strong and healthy.

32:36.441 --> 32:38.832
I would like to do
a chorionic villi sampling.

32:38.952 --> 32:40.528
- It's simply...
- CVS.

32:40.648 --> 32:44.214
A procedure for the prenatal diagnosis
of genetic disorders

32:44.398 --> 32:46.890
in which small samples of placenta

32:47.010 --> 32:49.303
are obtained
for chromosomal DNA analysis.

32:50.946 --> 32:53.307
It does require your permission
at this early stage.

32:54.909 --> 32:57.479
Well, I think we should do it.
I mean, with the hyperbaric treatment

32:57.599 --> 32:59.396
- and Nina's pregnancy.
- Good.

33:00.051 --> 33:01.815
I'll get it arranged right away.

33:04.044 --> 33:05.479
Thanks, Dr. Bruen.

33:07.505 --> 33:09.114
What if they find something wrong?

33:11.466 --> 33:12.582
They won't.

33:13.073 --> 33:15.662
- I wanna have our baby.
- And you will.

33:17.434 --> 33:18.841
And he'll be

33:19.499 --> 33:20.431
strong

33:20.909 --> 33:21.877
and healthy.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.201
And he'll be loved.

33:26.893 --> 33:27.633
"He"?

33:31.453 --> 33:32.679
Just a guess...

33:39.372 --> 33:42.636
- Enough marrow to do DNA test?
- Yeah, more than enough.

33:42.756 --> 33:45.752
I need to get a sample to the NHM 
see what they can tell us.

33:45.872 --> 33:47.736
- Okay. Tell me when you're done?
- Sure.

33:48.392 --> 33:50.508
- When did you get back?
- About an hour ago.

33:50.628 --> 33:51.868
What's going on?

33:52.709 --> 33:54.951
- You wanna get a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

33:55.304 --> 33:57.913
- Carlos, when you get something...
- You'll be the first to know.

34:25.393 --> 34:26.925
Okay, I'll be back in an hour.

35:07.959 --> 35:10.309
- Jamila is scared to death.
- Yeah.

35:10.585 --> 35:13.822
Well if we get a DNA match with
the cheetah hair, it'll be all over.

35:14.006 --> 35:16.825
I should have the DNA
sequenced in a few hours.

35:18.079 --> 35:20.495
Okay guys, the tooth
is not from a cheetah.

35:21.225 --> 35:21.987
What?

35:22.107 --> 35:24.666
I was talking with one of the top guys
who studies African cats.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.831
He said the tooth is too big
to be from a cheetah.

35:26.951 --> 35:28.211
Too big even for a lion.

35:29.107 --> 35:30.922
So where does he think it came from?

35:31.451 --> 35:32.501
Not a clue.

35:32.996 --> 35:35.302
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Okay, wait a second.

35:37.255 --> 35:40.265
The mitochondrial DNA says the hair
came from a cheetah, right?

35:40.535 --> 35:41.317
Yes.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.018
Mitochondrial DNA

35:43.340 --> 35:45.390
only reflects maternal lineage.

35:45.973 --> 35:47.522
Experts are saying it's not cheetah.

35:49.189 --> 35:49.965
Shit.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.694
- I'll need to see the entire genome.
- Right.

35:52.990 --> 35:55.137
What makes us different
is in the chromosomal DNA,

35:55.257 --> 35:57.199
not necessarily in the mitochondrial.

35:57.432 --> 35:58.517
I'll get on it.

36:00.829 --> 36:02.946
I got a bad feeling about this.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.307
Let's get this to David.

36:32.798 --> 36:35.924
We found cheetah DNA
in the complete genome

36:36.320 --> 36:38.010
as well as puma DNA.

36:38.444 --> 36:41.076
So a female cheetah
and a male puma were crossed?

36:41.259 --> 36:43.492
That'd be like crossing
a human being and a chimp.

36:43.612 --> 36:45.914
No, but there's something else
going on in the DNA.

36:46.193 --> 36:50.460
And the BLAST could not identify
this "something else" to a known feline.

36:50.764 --> 36:52.128
- Why not?
- Obviously

36:52.290 --> 36:53.797
it wasn't in the data bank.

36:54.086 --> 36:56.508
- Something nobody's seen before.
- What about this?

36:57.748 --> 37:01.258
We know that cheetahs and pumas have
a common prehistoric ancestor, right?

37:01.378 --> 37:02.788
They evolve, they split.

37:03.118 --> 37:06.696
And then 10,000 years ago,
cheetahs disappeared from North America.

37:06.816 --> 37:08.270
How are they doing in Africa?

37:08.453 --> 37:10.941
Natural breeding grounds
have been reduced dramatically,

37:11.061 --> 37:13.037
subsequently the gene pool
has shrunk to the point

37:13.157 --> 37:14.976
where all cheetahs
are genetically linked.

37:15.096 --> 37:15.852
Exactly.

37:16.429 --> 37:19.335
So what if somebody wanted
to widen the cheetah gene pool, right?

37:19.455 --> 37:22.117
Give the species a chance to strengthen
their own genetic structure.

37:22.601 --> 37:25.580
Like a genetically engineered,
new generation cheetah?

37:25.700 --> 37:27.032
I'm thinking old generation.

37:27.152 --> 37:30.083
Something that's closer
to their prehistoric puma ancestors.

37:30.375 --> 37:34.413
Hold it. So you're saying my nephew
was killed by a prehistoric cat?

37:34.533 --> 37:35.964
Like a saber-toothed tiger?

37:36.128 --> 37:37.073
Kind of. Look,

37:37.193 --> 37:40.254
we know that prehistoric mammoth DNA
has been catalogued, right?

37:40.578 --> 37:43.179
What if somebody got their hands
on some prehistoric puma DNA?

37:43.437 --> 37:46.016
That would be a closer genetic link
to a modern-day cheetah.

37:46.178 --> 37:47.398
You splice that in,

37:47.518 --> 37:51.313
you create an artificial cheetah
designed for expanding the gene pool.

37:51.534 --> 37:53.273
And then maybe, it escaped.

37:54.330 --> 37:56.669
If someone succeeded and this got out...

37:56.960 --> 37:59.352
You're not about to hang up
"Please help my find my lost

37:59.472 --> 38:01.364
"Prehistoric Kitten" sign up, are you?

38:01.548 --> 38:05.285
Not if they knew their furry little lab
experiment killed a 6-year-old boy.

38:07.846 --> 38:10.677
Carlos, I know the University of Oxford
has been doing a lot of work with...

38:10.797 --> 38:12.292
the DNA of prehistoric cats.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.411
Yeah.
I'll see if I can't get a match to ours.

38:15.833 --> 38:16.546
Mayko,

38:16.730 --> 38:19.612
do you think you can get me a list
of every lab, zoo,

38:19.862 --> 38:22.510
I don't know, university labs
researching feline genealogy?

38:23.259 --> 38:24.469
Yeah, sure.

38:24.696 --> 38:26.097
But even if I do...

38:26.281 --> 38:29.207
You find the lab,
I'll make them own up, believe me.

38:30.711 --> 38:32.854
We may never know
who's responsible for this.

38:33.467 --> 38:34.564
But if we're right,

38:35.856 --> 38:38.554
It's still out there.
It's likely to kill again.

38:40.460 --> 38:42.131
You wanna call the Sheriff?

38:43.685 --> 38:44.828
Yeah, I will.

38:45.943 --> 38:46.822
Thanks.

38:58.653 --> 39:02.054
So we should begin
to see results by this evening.

39:03.549 --> 39:07.931
Can we start taking her off
the anti-depressants and neuroleptics?

39:08.212 --> 39:10.499
Let see how she responds first.

39:11.437 --> 39:12.644
It's gonna be fine.

39:13.973 --> 39:15.088
Sure it is.

39:15.818 --> 39:16.701
Excuse me.

39:21.156 --> 39:22.654
David's worried about the baby.

39:24.777 --> 39:25.857
Don't worry.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.425
Take good care of her, my friend.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.821
Thanks, Carlos.

39:46.099 --> 39:47.066
Excuse me.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.089
How's the patient doing?

39:57.290 --> 40:00.233
- As well as can be expected.
- I understand she's pregnant.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.237
- Where did you hear that?
- And the condition of the baby?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.298
- Everything okay, David?
- It's fine.

40:11.353 --> 40:13.663
- Carl and I, we were...
- We were just catching up.

40:14.969 --> 40:17.542
- I'll get us a taxi.
- I'll be right there.

40:20.344 --> 40:21.126
Well?

40:24.657 --> 40:26.457
When did you start working for Roth?

40:27.664 --> 40:30.096
- I beg your pardon?
- That's who you report to these days.

40:30.281 --> 40:32.640
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

40:32.845 --> 40:35.715
It's kind of funny that a man such
as yourself with all these connections,

40:35.835 --> 40:38.772
and political power and ambition, can't
seem to find the needle in a haystack.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.495
Difficult man to find.

40:40.749 --> 40:42.373
When did he put you on the payroll?

40:45.814 --> 40:47.395
Take your hand off me.

40:51.762 --> 40:52.994
I'll keep looking.

40:53.970 --> 40:56.159
Nevermind, I'll do it myself.

42:59.888 --> 43:01.952
Oxford University got back to us.

43:02.468 --> 43:05.233
We're definitely dealing
with some engineered DNA.

43:07.363 --> 43:08.595
You still there?

43:09.184 --> 43:09.923
Yeah.

43:10.581 --> 43:11.406
Yeah.

43:13.227 --> 43:14.831
This whole week

43:14.951 --> 43:17.932
has been about whether or not
Jamila's been telling the truth.

43:18.052 --> 43:19.051
<i>She was.</i>

43:21.205 --> 43:21.991
Yeah,

43:22.813 --> 43:24.451
this fucking place...

43:25.279 --> 43:27.023
It shouldn't have been about that,
David.

43:27.903 --> 43:31.367
It should have been about what
my baby sister's been going through.

43:32.518 --> 43:36.082
Tell you what. Why don't you take
an extra week and make it about that.

43:36.821 --> 43:37.553
Yeah.

43:39.175 --> 43:41.037
- Thank you, David.
- <i>Sure.</i>

43:43.111 --> 43:44.755
Uh, look I gotta go.

43:44.875 --> 43:46.957
There's somebody at the door.
I'll see you next week?

43:48.019 --> 43:49.317
Okay. Take care.

43:49.923 --> 43:50.938
You too.

43:58.956 --> 43:59.971
Hey Bob.

44:00.580 --> 44:01.580
Hey David.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.103
You have the CVS test results back?

44:06.259 --> 44:07.191
We did.

44:08.643 --> 44:09.691
What is it?

44:17.371 --> 44:18.577
Is the baby alright?

44:19.080 --> 44:20.080
It's fine.

44:20.884 --> 44:21.958
What's wrong?

44:25.834 --> 44:27.508
When I was a kid. I...

44:29.392 --> 44:30.392
I got sick.

44:31.520 --> 44:32.328
Yeah?

44:33.671 --> 44:35.901
Well I had myself checked again today.

44:37.332 --> 44:38.209
David,

44:39.290 --> 44:40.795
what happened to me...

44:42.678 --> 44:43.893
The baby...

44:45.741 --> 44:47.023
It can't be mine.

45:19.902 --> 45:21.919
- Greetings from Moldova.
- You're kidding.

45:22.039 --> 45:25.726
WHO was called in on a mystery illness
in a city called Birku.

45:25.846 --> 45:27.143
Over two hundred dead.

45:27.327 --> 45:30.521
Riddlemeyer would have an aneurysm if he
caught us outside our jurisdiction.

45:30.997 --> 45:32.398
- I wanna go.
- To Moldova?!

45:33.008 --> 45:34.650
I think Jack's in some kind of trouble.

45:34.834 --> 45:36.819
- Who's Emil Lupu?
- Moldovan Health Minister.

45:37.003 --> 45:38.529
The problem has been dealt with.

45:38.713 --> 45:40.782
The symptoms do not match the disease.

45:40.965 --> 45:43.076
This pregnancy is very very confusing.

45:43.259 --> 45:45.411
You have to consider termination.

45:45.919 --> 45:47.455
We need to find Roth.

45:47.659 --> 45:50.897
He has this corporate jet that he uses
to fly down to the Turks and Caicos.

45:51.017 --> 45:53.169
- He has a place there?
- I know who you can ask.

45:55.146 --> 45:56.923
- Nina...
- Sure looks like her.

45:57.106 --> 45:58.549
I don't know what Roth is up to.

45:58.733 --> 46:00.213
You haven't ben in touch with him?

46:00.333 --> 46:03.244
All I know is I'm having a baby.
That's what I'm concerned about.

46:03.424 --> 46:06.140
That son of a bitch has gone ahead and
activated their Jacobson's organ.

46:06.647 --> 46:07.600
Oh my God.

46:08.086 --> 46:10.311
I tried to make the world
a better place.

46:10.495 --> 46:13.007
- Roth, we can still stop this.
- It's too late.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.149
Hey, Roth, take it easy!

46:16.305 --> 46:22.266
