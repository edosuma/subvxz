00:02.922 --> 00:07.058
<i>Maud is secretly raising
an army to regain the throne.</i>

00:07.059 --> 00:09.094
God is on your side.

00:09.095 --> 00:12.597
<i>Then why hasn't he put Maud
and her bastard brother down?</i>

00:12.598 --> 00:15.066
His Majesty, King Stephen!

00:15.067 --> 00:16.401
If you wish,

00:16.402 --> 00:18.703
you may join my army
to prove your loyalty.

00:18.704 --> 00:21.039
Give him the knighthood
and title he deserves.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.907
And may God save England.

00:22.908 --> 00:24.776
With your father's death,
he will.

00:26.479 --> 00:29.147
(Screaming)

00:29.148 --> 00:30.381
I miss you so...

00:30.382 --> 00:31.916
<i>I'm Tom of Kingsbridge.</i>

00:31.917 --> 00:34.819
We'll be quarrying this stone
to build our new cathedral.

00:34.820 --> 00:36.788
Your good bishop
doesn't care a whit

00:36.789 --> 00:38.756
for your precious cathedral.

00:38.757 --> 00:40.125
(Horses neighing)

00:40.126 --> 00:42.127
But where is
the statue of St. Adolphus?

00:46.899 --> 00:48.600
<i>Tears of blood.</i>

00:48.601 --> 00:50.135
One king destroys...

(Birds cawing)

02:58.697 --> 03:00.231
(Exhaling)

03:01.600 --> 03:04.735
I'm feeling much better
from this ague, my dear.

03:04.736 --> 03:06.170
My physician says that

03:06.171 --> 03:08.673
I should be on my feet
in a week.

03:08.674 --> 03:12.310
Oh, I am so relieved,
my darling!

03:12.311 --> 03:14.745
Mmm... Ah...

03:16.348 --> 03:17.849
(Exhaling)

03:20.185 --> 03:21.786
Any word from William?

03:21.787 --> 03:24.489
Well, the king's army
have engaged Maud at Lincoln.

03:26.358 --> 03:29.393
<i>Her half brother, Gloucester,
is away in France,</i>

03:29.394 --> 03:30.862
<i>so he can't help her.</i>

03:30.863 --> 03:32.697
She's held it for 4 years now,

03:32.698 --> 03:34.298
and it's time we took it back.

03:38.437 --> 03:41.572
Oh, there's a new knight
fighting for Stephen,

03:41.573 --> 03:42.607
William says,

03:42.608 --> 03:44.775
who no one's ever heard of.

03:44.776 --> 03:46.944
Very mysterious fellow.

03:46.945 --> 03:48.946
Learned to fight in France.

03:50.215 --> 03:52.850
But evidently quite
extraordinary. Hmm!

03:54.086 --> 03:56.787
Our sweet William,
I fear, is jealous.

03:56.788 --> 03:58.155
(Chuckles)

03:58.156 --> 04:01.058
He can be so
like a child sometimes.

04:04.296 --> 04:06.264
What's this, my dear?

04:06.265 --> 04:09.166
Oh, the doctor said
you needed to be bled.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.135
He's too busy to
do it, of course.

04:11.136 --> 04:12.203
Oh, bless you.

04:12.204 --> 04:13.271
Mmm!

04:15.807 --> 04:17.708
(Grunting)

04:19.344 --> 04:21.077
(Grunts)

04:21.079 --> 04:23.180
William is being held back,

04:23.181 --> 04:25.650
but not by some
anonymous knight.

04:25.651 --> 04:27.385
He's nearly 25 years old.

04:27.386 --> 04:30.454
He needs to marry
and give us grandchildren.

04:30.455 --> 04:32.623
There are plenty of
women who'd have him.

04:32.624 --> 04:35.293
None of sufficient
nobility, my love.

04:35.294 --> 04:39.463
And if he can't marry a title,
he shall have to inherit one.

04:39.464 --> 04:42.033
Are you suggesting that
I retire and give him mine?

04:42.034 --> 04:43.034
(Laughs)

04:43.035 --> 04:46.203
I know you'd never
agree to that.

04:46.204 --> 04:48.439
Not in my prime, I wouldn't!

04:49.875 --> 04:52.276
There, that's quite
enough, my dear.

04:52.277 --> 04:54.912
You drink too much, Percy.

04:54.913 --> 04:56.948
Your tongue's too loose.

04:56.949 --> 04:59.350
I fear you've cut too deep.

04:59.351 --> 05:00.718
No, my sweet.

05:02.454 --> 05:04.088
(Grunting)

05:05.290 --> 05:06.724
Not deep enough.

05:06.725 --> 05:08.793
(Screaming)

05:09.828 --> 05:12.496
(Man):
Climb up the ladder!

05:12.497 --> 05:15.232
(Percy grunting)

05:16.935 --> 05:17.902
Ah...

05:20.405 --> 05:21.806
(Panting)

05:23.342 --> 05:25.576
We need more steel and daggers!

05:25.577 --> 05:26.577
(Screaming)

06:03.215 --> 06:05.850
Stephen's army
has us surrounded.

06:05.851 --> 06:08.119
We've been besieged for weeks.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.420
How am I supposed to eat

06:09.421 --> 06:12.189
when everyone else
is starving for my sake?

06:13.792 --> 06:16.594
You must keep up
your strength, my Queen.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.466
Where is Gloucester?

06:22.467 --> 06:23.801
My brother has never

06:23.802 --> 06:25.102
abandoned us before!

06:25.103 --> 06:27.338
He should be arriving soon.

06:27.339 --> 06:29.407
Why isn't he coming?

06:30.876 --> 06:32.777
Gloucester may indeed
be raising forces

06:32.778 --> 06:34.412
to rescue his sister,
Your Majesty.

06:34.413 --> 06:36.614
But we have surrounded
Lincoln castle,

06:36.615 --> 06:38.616
and shortly they will starve.

06:38.617 --> 06:40.851
Excellent!
The end is in sight.

06:40.852 --> 06:44.055
You are to be congratulated,
young man.

06:44.056 --> 06:46.357
You hear that, Eustace?

06:46.358 --> 06:48.426
The crown will be yours,
after all.

06:48.427 --> 06:50.061
Yes, yes!

06:51.730 --> 06:55.166
My... condolences
on your father's death.

06:55.167 --> 06:58.235
An ague can be
so unpredictable.

06:58.236 --> 07:00.471
He was a loyal subject.

07:00.472 --> 07:02.540
As am I, Your Majesty,

07:02.541 --> 07:05.242
as I hope to be
as the new earl.

07:05.243 --> 07:06.377
Yes, quite.

07:07.379 --> 07:08.579
We...

07:08.580 --> 07:11.849
We have some problems
regarding the earldom.

07:11.850 --> 07:15.152
- Your Majesty?
- There is another claimant.

07:15.153 --> 07:16.420
Is he here?

07:18.156 --> 07:20.825
(All murmuring)

07:23.995 --> 07:27.698
Richard of Kingsbridge,
champion of the battlefield.

07:27.699 --> 07:30.367
You have, indeed,
proved your loyalty

07:30.368 --> 07:33.037
against your father's treason.

07:33.038 --> 07:36.140
I will weigh your claim
most carefully.

07:36.141 --> 07:38.476
I ask for nothing
more, My King.

07:38.477 --> 07:41.712
How did Richard get the money
to become a knight?

07:41.713 --> 07:44.548
The armor alone
costs a small fortune!

07:45.550 --> 07:48.052
It seems he has
a wealthy sister.

07:57.729 --> 07:59.330
I'm the earl!

07:59.331 --> 08:00.664
I'm the rightful earl!

08:00.665 --> 08:03.968
Richard lost that claim
when his father lost his head!

08:03.969 --> 08:06.837
Getting soldiers is
all the king cares about.

08:06.838 --> 08:08.773
Raise an army to finish Maud,

08:08.774 --> 08:10.708
he'll give you
whatever you want.

08:10.709 --> 08:13.844
Easily said, but where
do we get the means to do it?

08:13.845 --> 08:16.514
The market at Kingsbridge
sucks the money out of Shiring.

08:16.515 --> 08:19.016
Kingsbridge gets the rents,
the taxes, business...

08:19.017 --> 08:20.217
Close the market.

08:20.218 --> 08:23.621
How? The king
has licensed it!

08:23.622 --> 08:25.356
Oh yes.

08:26.525 --> 08:28.392
Unfortunately, he has.

08:29.928 --> 08:31.262
What?

08:31.263 --> 08:32.962
If I close the market for you,

08:32.964 --> 08:34.865
will you close
the quarry for me?

08:34.866 --> 08:36.000
Hmm!

08:36.001 --> 08:37.168
(Rain falling)

08:37.169 --> 08:38.769
Still trying to
stop that cathedral

08:38.770 --> 08:40.770
so you can build
your precious palace?

08:40.772 --> 08:42.606
How will you close the market?

08:42.607 --> 08:44.675
I haven't worked that out yet.

08:44.676 --> 08:47.645
Have you got any
brilliant ideas, William?

08:47.646 --> 08:48.946
A fire.

08:50.982 --> 08:52.683
Start a fire.

08:52.684 --> 08:55.052
It's worked for you before.

08:55.053 --> 08:56.854
- Hush, William.
- Mother...

08:56.855 --> 08:57.955
I said quiet!

08:57.956 --> 08:59.857
William might be right.

09:02.227 --> 09:04.228
A fire...

09:05.797 --> 09:07.531
But a small one this time.

09:14.606 --> 09:16.273
(Oxen grunting)

09:19.344 --> 09:21.912
(Workers shouting, indistinct)

09:23.648 --> 09:25.416
(Hammering)

09:27.719 --> 09:29.453
Check that windlass, Jack!

09:29.454 --> 09:31.322
Make sure
it's well-greased.

09:31.323 --> 09:32.857
That big wheel needs to go up.

09:58.783 --> 10:00.651
I'm impressed, Prior Philip.

10:00.652 --> 10:03.454
You've made astonishing
progress since I left.

10:03.455 --> 10:05.856
And it's not just
the church, Richard.

10:05.857 --> 10:08.058
Everyone has
the money to buy things.

10:08.059 --> 10:10.761
The town is 3 times
the size of what it was,

10:10.762 --> 10:12.129
5 times on market day!

10:12.130 --> 10:14.098
They want to buy
your sister's wool.

10:14.099 --> 10:16.700
They come to see the only
female wool merchant

10:16.701 --> 10:17.935
in this part of England.

10:17.936 --> 10:20.771
Grown men quake
at the sight of me.

10:23.074 --> 10:25.576
Now, don't hit your thumb.
Right? Right?

10:25.577 --> 10:26.610
Right.

10:26.611 --> 10:28.012
Ooh!

10:28.013 --> 10:29.980
(Laughing): See?

10:29.981 --> 10:32.383
(Man):
Still working on that, sir?

10:32.384 --> 10:34.084
Want me to get it for you?

10:35.387 --> 10:38.555
We're enclosing the east end
while we work on the rest.

10:38.556 --> 10:41.292
This will protect the altar
from weather and dust.

10:41.293 --> 10:43.661
You look tired and happy, Tom.

10:43.662 --> 10:45.629
I am. And I am.

10:45.630 --> 10:47.431
Are you free Thursday next?

10:47.432 --> 10:50.034
I'm giving a dinner in honor
of Richard's safe return.

10:50.035 --> 10:52.469
Thank you.
It would be my pleasure.

10:53.505 --> 10:56.340
You're invited too, Jack!

11:17.696 --> 11:19.263
(♪ Flutes ♪)

11:19.264 --> 11:22.232
Have you ever killed a giant?

11:22.233 --> 11:24.935
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I have.

11:24.936 --> 11:27.705
- How big?
- As big as this house.

11:27.706 --> 11:30.107
Oh! Was there a lot of blood?

11:30.108 --> 11:32.109
No, because I frightened him.

11:32.110 --> 11:35.379
He was afraid of mice,
so I put one down his trousers.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.747
It terrified him so much,

11:36.748 --> 11:37.848
he dropped down dead.

11:37.849 --> 11:39.216
(Laughing)

11:39.217 --> 11:40.718
Can I see your dagger?

11:40.719 --> 11:42.953
Ahh!

11:42.954 --> 11:44.154
(Laughing)

11:44.155 --> 11:45.456
He's a darling, isn't he?

11:45.457 --> 11:48.859
Better off here than
with his real parents.

11:48.860 --> 11:51.795
His da was a cutpurse,
most likely,

11:51.796 --> 11:53.664
and his mother, a whore.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.934
A tender trap, the world.

11:58.169 --> 12:01.638
I left my sister
to join the priory.

12:01.639 --> 12:04.008
I raised her since infancy,

12:04.009 --> 12:06.543
and she took to the streets.

12:06.544 --> 12:09.513
I'll never forgive
myself for that.

12:09.514 --> 12:11.148
This is your love line.

12:11.149 --> 12:13.684
Oh, I see you have
many female admirers!

12:13.685 --> 12:15.919
What's funny, Martha?
Don't you admire me?

12:15.920 --> 12:17.621
Definitely not!

12:17.622 --> 12:21.358
I do. I think your cathedral
work is lovely, Alfred.

12:21.359 --> 12:23.894

worked a miracle!

Your love line's split,

You love 2 women, Jack,

14:57.715 --> 15:01.518
You see, the only way to close
the quarry involves bloodshed.

15:01.519 --> 15:03.720
Innocent lives shall be lost.

15:03.721 --> 15:07.090
My son shall burn in hell
for your sins.

15:10.428 --> 15:13.363
That's why you've been
a reluctant enforcer, William?

15:15.200 --> 15:18.001
Mother's always
been afraid of fire.

15:18.002 --> 15:20.537
But the fires of hell
are eternal.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.084
On your knees.

15:42.327 --> 15:43.493
Are you sorry

15:43.494 --> 15:46.396
for all the lives
taken by your sword

15:46.397 --> 15:48.799
in the past and in the future?

15:48.800 --> 15:49.800
Oh yes.

15:52.003 --> 15:54.171
<i>Ego te absolvo.</i>

15:56.274 --> 15:57.708
Do what you must.

15:59.477 --> 16:01.278
(Exhales)

16:02.313 --> 16:03.947
Oh, thank you.

16:23.534 --> 16:25.168
(Neighing)

16:28.940 --> 16:31.008
(Cow mooing)

16:31.009 --> 16:32.175
My Lord Bishop.

16:32.176 --> 16:34.511
What brings us
this great honor?

16:35.647 --> 16:37.781
Save the sarcasm, Philip.

16:37.782 --> 16:39.950
Order from the Sheriff.

16:39.951 --> 16:41.318
It's forbidden to run a market

16:41.319 --> 16:42.919
without a license
from the king.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.655
But we have a license.

16:44.656 --> 16:46.123
May I see it?

17:00.338 --> 17:02.039
(Grunting)

17:02.040 --> 17:03.640
(Sighing)

17:03.641 --> 17:05.375
Ah, it's been stolen.

17:05.376 --> 17:07.010
The Sheriff
has no record of it.

17:07.011 --> 17:08.211
Then he's a liar.

17:09.547 --> 17:11.714
I think you are
the liar, Philip.

17:13.417 --> 17:16.520
As of next month,
the market moves to Shiring.

17:16.521 --> 17:18.755
Why should this concern you?

17:18.756 --> 17:22.059
- All Satan's lies concern me.
- I'm not Satan!

17:22.060 --> 17:23.894
You're an obstruction
to God's rule,

17:23.895 --> 17:26.363
which is the Church,
which is Satan's adversary.

17:26.364 --> 17:28.131
I am part of the Church!

17:28.132 --> 17:30.067
Then why do you defy me?
Obey me.

17:30.068 --> 17:32.736
I obey God before you!

17:32.737 --> 17:35.005
The Church has rules
and hierarchy!

17:35.006 --> 17:38.108
- I obey my heart...
- Kneel before me...

17:38.109 --> 17:39.509
now!

17:48.986 --> 17:50.253
Proud Philip.

17:50.254 --> 17:51.688
I'll appeal to the king.

17:51.689 --> 17:55.025
The king is preoccupied
at the moment.

17:55.026 --> 17:57.060
He's about to win a war.

18:03.468 --> 18:05.802
(Screaming)

18:05.803 --> 18:08.205
AHH!

18:08.206 --> 18:10.674
(Loud grunting)

18:11.976 --> 18:13.043
(Neighing)

18:20.618 --> 18:22.652
(Screaming)

18:56.154 --> 18:59.022
(Men shouting, indistinct)

18:59.023 --> 19:00.624
(Animals clucking)

19:05.096 --> 19:07.297
(Birds chirping)

19:51.108 --> 19:53.376
(Clanking)

20:04.222 --> 20:06.556
You're the witch's son, right?

20:08.259 --> 20:09.626
She's not a witch.

20:09.627 --> 20:11.495
Words.

20:12.530 --> 20:14.464
How did you recognize me?

20:14.465 --> 20:15.832
We've never met.

20:15.833 --> 20:16.867
The hair!

20:16.868 --> 20:19.703
It's my father's hair,
not hers.

20:21.439 --> 20:23.340
You knew him?

20:23.341 --> 20:26.042
- I've heard his story, yes.
- No, more than that.

20:26.043 --> 20:27.677
You saw him.

20:27.678 --> 20:31.014
Was that before or after
he was falsely accused?

20:31.015 --> 20:33.850
Your affection for
a father you never met

20:33.851 --> 20:35.619
is touching but misplaced.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.187
I thought you'd know better

20:37.188 --> 20:39.422
than to take your mother's
word on his character,

20:39.423 --> 20:41.691
which I know only by hearsay.

20:41.692 --> 20:44.694
But the details are
very persuasive.

20:44.695 --> 20:46.763
He stole a chalice,

20:46.764 --> 20:49.132
a vessel who holds
the blood of Christ.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.200
Blasphemy.

20:50.201 --> 20:51.635
He impregnated a novice.

20:51.636 --> 20:53.036
Blasphemy.

20:53.037 --> 20:54.771
And he died without repenting.

20:54.772 --> 20:55.872
Blasphemy.

20:55.873 --> 20:57.007
Words.

20:57.008 --> 21:00.010
Yes, I'm good with words.

21:00.011 --> 21:01.745
We all have our talents.

21:01.746 --> 21:03.713
Yours are just as obvious.

21:03.714 --> 21:04.848
May I?

21:07.318 --> 21:09.286
(Laughing)

21:09.287 --> 21:11.555
Breathtaking little devils!

21:12.857 --> 21:14.224
Yes...

21:14.225 --> 21:16.192
You seem to know them well.

21:19.363 --> 21:20.931
(♪ Singing ♪)

21:22.934 --> 21:25.302
Who told you to carve this?

21:39.116 --> 21:42.319
Otto dead, and four others!

21:42.320 --> 21:43.920
Good-hearted,
God-fearing people

21:43.921 --> 21:46.122
who deserved the right
to peace and justice

21:46.123 --> 21:47.290
from their Lord!

21:47.291 --> 21:48.758
Enough to make angels weep!

21:48.759 --> 21:50.126
You must go to the king.

21:50.127 --> 21:52.228
He can get back
the quarry and the market.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.230
Richard goes to
Lincoln on the morrow.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.465
The king awaits him there.

21:58.102 --> 22:00.203
Can you spare Jack for a week?

22:00.204 --> 22:03.840
He can best explain
our construction needs.

22:09.146 --> 22:11.514
(Chattering, indistinct)

22:12.950 --> 22:16.119
No, that's fine.
Needs to be a little bit darker.

22:18.255 --> 22:19.422
Good morning, Jack!

22:19.423 --> 22:20.924
What brings you to town?

22:20.925 --> 22:22.492
I'm here to ask Richard

22:22.493 --> 22:25.362
if Prior Philip and I may
accompany him to Lincoln.

22:25.363 --> 22:27.063
Oh, he'll be happy
for the company.

22:27.064 --> 22:28.632
But he's not here at present.

22:28.633 --> 22:31.134
He's trying to win a kiss
from the blacksmith's daughter.

22:31.135 --> 22:34.604
Would you like to wait for him?
I expect him back soon.

22:36.607 --> 22:38.308
Have you seen my weaving room?

22:38.309 --> 22:41.144
It's not much,
but it's all I need.

22:46.951 --> 22:48.985
My new palace!

22:48.986 --> 22:50.920
Do you miss the old one?

22:50.921 --> 22:52.522
Oh, Lord no!

22:52.523 --> 22:53.590
I miss my father

22:53.591 --> 22:55.925
and I miss the people
I lived with.

22:55.926 --> 22:59.462
But I don't miss the obligations
or the pretensions.

22:59.463 --> 23:02.899
I certainly don't miss
my innocence or my ignorance,

23:02.900 --> 23:05.001
whatever it is you call it.

23:05.002 --> 23:06.002
I'm happy.

23:07.004 --> 23:08.872
Well, you've earned it.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.476
Are you? Happy?

23:14.712 --> 23:16.012
Am I happy...

23:17.648 --> 23:19.482
I think so. I think...

23:19.483 --> 23:21.051
Especially when I'm at work.

23:25.056 --> 23:27.023
When I work,
I hear these voices.

23:27.024 --> 23:29.259
Whose? The voices of angels?

23:29.260 --> 23:31.261
Are you some kind of saint?

23:31.262 --> 23:32.962
No, voices from the stone.

23:32.963 --> 23:35.765
When I carve it,
it tells me where to cut it.

23:35.766 --> 23:37.400
The stone speaks to you?

23:37.401 --> 23:40.203
No, not the stone,
but what it wants to be.

23:40.204 --> 23:41.805
So the saint or the gargoyle

23:41.806 --> 23:44.107
or the tiniest corner
of the cathedral...

23:44.108 --> 23:47.343
It doesn't even have to
have a face. It can be...

23:47.344 --> 23:51.848
a line or a design
or the curve of an arch.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.120
It's not a...
It's not a voice.

23:57.121 --> 23:59.622
It's a...
It is an image,

23:59.623 --> 24:02.158
but it's the sound
of an image, so...

24:03.994 --> 24:05.328
I can't describe it.

24:05.329 --> 24:06.863
(Chuckling):
I'm very sorry.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.766
I just...
I know when my...

24:09.767 --> 24:12.168
when my chisel hits the rock,

24:12.169 --> 24:14.938
that the rock's in tune.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.041
It's a song.

24:20.444 --> 24:22.178
That's it.

24:22.179 --> 24:24.547
It's a song of what will be.

24:27.017 --> 24:29.085
How very fortunate you are.

24:41.732 --> 24:44.134
There you are, Jack.

24:45.770 --> 24:47.403
Da wants you.

24:48.372 --> 24:50.607
They're mortaring the arches.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.521
(Exhales)

25:06.791 --> 25:08.224
(Chuckles)

25:12.062 --> 25:13.229
(Horse snorting)

25:13.230 --> 25:14.864
(People shouting in distance)

25:16.834 --> 25:18.301
(Laughing)

25:18.302 --> 25:20.003
Yeah, go on!
Get out of here!

25:24.275 --> 25:26.142
(Woman laughing)

25:27.978 --> 25:29.946
(Woman):
You're afraid of us?

25:29.947 --> 25:31.581
(Grunting)

25:35.152 --> 25:36.419
Whoa!

25:47.131 --> 25:50.133
Ah! You did well,
young Richard.

25:50.134 --> 25:51.935
(Horse whinnying)

25:51.936 --> 25:54.003
(Man):
Put them over there.

25:54.004 --> 25:56.039
Maud now controls
only the inner walls.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.974
The bitch won't
escape me this time.

25:59.009 --> 26:01.477
Richard of Kingsbridge!
Welcome back!

26:01.478 --> 26:03.479
It's good to be back,
My Lord King.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.815
The siege is going well?

26:05.816 --> 26:07.817
Monstrously well.

26:07.818 --> 26:10.753
Barely a month and already
the people are starving.

26:10.754 --> 26:13.022
They toss their dead
over the wall by the hour.

26:13.023 --> 26:15.992
The stench is awful but
the smell of victory is sweet.

26:15.993 --> 26:17.961
Ah!

26:17.962 --> 26:21.064
I see you've brought a monk
with you as your squire.

26:21.065 --> 26:23.266
This is the Prior
of Kingsbridge, Lord.

26:23.267 --> 26:25.535
Oh yes, Prior Philip.

26:25.536 --> 26:28.271
Well, have you come
to fight for me?

26:28.272 --> 26:32.308
I am here because God's work
needs help, My Lord King.

26:32.309 --> 26:35.378
If it were God's work,
then He should do it Himself.

26:35.379 --> 26:36.613
I'm busy.

26:40.117 --> 26:42.285
As a boon to me, your Majesty,

26:43.487 --> 26:45.355
would you hear him out?

26:53.964 --> 26:55.465
Take off your robe.

26:56.634 --> 26:58.468
Your Majesty?

26:58.469 --> 26:59.469
You heard me.

26:59.470 --> 27:00.837
Strip.

27:04.642 --> 27:07.510
You're more prideful
than you used to be.

27:07.511 --> 27:10.313
Oh, I don't wish to see
your pasty body.

27:10.314 --> 27:12.248
I wish to wear
your filthy clothes.

27:12.249 --> 27:13.616
William of Shiring?

27:13.617 --> 27:14.918
Yes, My Lord?

27:14.919 --> 27:16.252
Find him a tunic.

27:16.253 --> 27:18.454
(Horse whinnying)

27:18.455 --> 27:20.189
(Man talking, indistinct)

27:26.096 --> 27:27.730
(Chuckling)

27:27.731 --> 27:30.900
(People chuckling)

27:34.271 --> 27:36.406
(Chuckling)

27:40.544 --> 27:43.780
(Speaking Latin)

27:48.919 --> 27:51.955
I've wanted to take a look
around the city walls,

27:51.956 --> 27:55.825
and if I'm dressed as a monk,
they won't shoot at me.

27:55.826 --> 27:58.094
You, on the other hand,
are an easy target.

27:59.530 --> 28:03.132
Perhaps it is God's will that
I should die to save the king.

28:04.401 --> 28:06.703
I've never
understood God's will.

28:10.908 --> 28:12.375
(Crow cawing)

28:12.376 --> 28:14.310
(Both grunting)

28:17.982 --> 28:20.350
Do you think He wills that?

28:20.351 --> 28:22.385
I don't know, My Lord.

28:25.422 --> 28:26.923
(Flies buzzing)

28:26.924 --> 28:29.492
I only ask God for one life:

28:29.493 --> 28:31.127
Maud's.

28:31.128 --> 28:34.163
She doesn't even need to
be killed, simply handed over.

28:34.164 --> 28:36.432
But instead they let
their children go hungry

28:36.433 --> 28:38.968
and their grandparents
waste away to bones.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.770
It's their choice.
It's not mine.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.940
And it's certainly not God's.

28:43.941 --> 28:45.675
Look!

28:49.747 --> 28:51.981
Are you frightened, Philip?

28:51.982 --> 28:53.916
(Man shouting, indistinct)

28:53.917 --> 28:55.518
Well, the archers
are very good.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.722
Yes, My Lord,
I'm very frightened.

28:59.723 --> 29:02.825
If I am killed, will you
re-license Kingsbridge market?

29:02.826 --> 29:04.727
Ah. Well, now we
get to the point.

29:04.728 --> 29:06.362
Well, don't you have a license?

29:06.363 --> 29:08.865
- It's been lost.
- Will you pay for a new one?

29:08.866 --> 29:12.769
Yes, unless you're willing to
grant it freely for God's glory.

29:12.770 --> 29:13.970
(Crow cawing)

29:13.971 --> 29:15.772
Well, you're a proud
and frugal man.

29:15.773 --> 29:18.608
Will you give me the right to
take stone from the quarry?

29:18.609 --> 29:21.377
Didn't I give you
that right before?

29:21.378 --> 29:22.979
Yes, but you took it away.

29:22.980 --> 29:25.081
Ah, yes.

29:26.517 --> 29:29.786
Yes, that's because
I was warned about you.

29:31.221 --> 29:33.656
By whom?
By the bishop?

29:33.657 --> 29:36.192
- It doesn't matter now.
- Prior!

29:40.064 --> 29:42.865
<i>(Henry): Whose hair of flame?
An artist boy's.</i>

29:42.866 --> 29:46.202
One king he crowns,
one king destroys.

29:48.238 --> 29:50.206
That boy with the red hair?

29:50.207 --> 29:51.908
I want him dead by morning.

29:51.909 --> 29:53.309
My Lord! My Lord King!

29:53.310 --> 29:55.178
Gloucester's army
is coming to free Maud.

29:55.179 --> 29:57.413
They'll be here
by mid-afternoon.

29:57.414 --> 29:59.415
Good.
Prepare for battle.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.818
Your Majesty! The market
license and the quarry?

30:01.819 --> 30:02.985
Denied.

30:06.156 --> 30:08.091
(Man):
Grab your weapons, boys!

30:13.130 --> 30:15.264
(Snorting)

30:16.733 --> 30:18.401
(Whinnying)

30:18.402 --> 30:20.570
(Neighing)

30:20.571 --> 30:22.872
(Man shouting, indistinct)

30:27.678 --> 30:30.379
(Neighing, snorting)

30:53.170 --> 30:55.571
(Baby crying in distance)

30:55.572 --> 30:58.641
Our only hope now
is if Stephen is defeated.

31:01.678 --> 31:02.979
Normally, at this hour,

31:02.980 --> 31:05.148
I'm on my knees,
singing God's praise.

31:05.149 --> 31:06.382
Do you pray, Jack?

31:07.618 --> 31:10.887
My work I think of
as a kind of prayer.

31:12.089 --> 31:14.056
Some of God's greatest artists

31:14.057 --> 31:16.859
and writers and musicians
were religious.

31:16.860 --> 31:18.094
Pray with me.

31:19.329 --> 31:20.563
Oh!

31:20.564 --> 31:22.765
Oh dear.
My, uh, my beads.

31:22.766 --> 31:24.967
They must have fallen off
when I took off my robe.

31:24.968 --> 31:27.637
Go to the church, would you?
See if someone's found them?

31:27.638 --> 31:28.771
Yes, Prior.

31:33.310 --> 31:35.478
Yah!

31:35.479 --> 31:38.281
(All roaring)

31:48.325 --> 31:50.560
(Grunting)

32:03.273 --> 32:04.907
(Grunting)

32:13.350 --> 32:14.750
(Grunting)

32:15.786 --> 32:17.353
(Grunting)

32:34.838 --> 32:37.006
(Shouting and screaming)

32:54.024 --> 32:55.391
(Groaning)

33:01.365 --> 33:02.798
(Grunting)

33:10.073 --> 33:12.575
Gloucester's retreating
to the forest.

33:12.576 --> 33:14.577
Stephen is given chase.

33:27.524 --> 33:29.058
(Grunting)

33:32.729 --> 33:34.430
(Grunting)

33:40.237 --> 33:41.570
(Roaring)

33:57.554 --> 33:59.455
Robert of Gloucester,

33:59.456 --> 34:03.959
I claim you as my prisoner
in the name of King Stephen.

34:05.195 --> 34:07.997
(Sentry):
I can't see the King anymore.

34:07.998 --> 34:09.665
(Grunting)

34:14.670 --> 34:16.739
(Gasping)

34:16.739 --> 34:18.040
(Soldier 1):
We have him!

34:18.041 --> 34:20.009
(Cheering)

34:20.010 --> 34:22.277
(Soldier 2):
The king is ransomed!

34:22.279 --> 34:24.480
(Roaring)

34:25.916 --> 34:28.317
They've captured the King.

34:28.318 --> 34:30.820
Gloucester has won!
Sound the retreat!

34:30.821 --> 34:32.288
Retreat!

34:32.289 --> 34:34.255
Retreat!

34:34.257 --> 34:36.759
(Soldier):
See them run!

34:39.496 --> 34:41.697
What is it?
What's happening?

34:41.697 --> 34:43.632
Your brother's been taken.

34:43.632 --> 34:45.400
Oh God!

34:45.402 --> 34:46.469
As has the King.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.603
Our soldiers ambushed him.

34:48.605 --> 34:50.973
Stephen's army is
sounding a retreat.

34:50.974 --> 34:52.375
They're running away.

34:52.376 --> 34:55.344
Your brother's men
are coming to free us.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.512
We've won!

34:58.148 --> 35:00.883
(Gasping)

35:00.884 --> 35:02.318
(Man):
God save Queen Maud!

35:14.164 --> 35:16.499
(Woman screaming)

35:19.136 --> 35:20.870
(Clothing ripping)

35:20.871 --> 35:21.971
Stop!

35:21.972 --> 35:23.873
In the name of
Christ Jesus, stop!

35:32.048 --> 35:34.183
(Crows cawing)

35:40.757 --> 35:43.058
(Neighing)

35:53.236 --> 35:54.770
(Neighing in distance)

36:01.144 --> 36:04.213
We'll have to do
a bit of a dance,

36:04.214 --> 36:05.648
but God is on our side.

36:05.649 --> 36:08.584
Do you have your
story straight, William?

36:08.585 --> 36:09.885
Pray God she believes it.

36:11.888 --> 36:13.622
Why are you here?

36:13.623 --> 36:15.758
You sided against us.

36:15.759 --> 36:18.394
Your king lies in our dungeon
to be hanged tomorrow.

36:18.395 --> 36:20.095
Why shouldn't you
hang with him?

36:21.131 --> 36:22.698
My Lady...

36:22.699 --> 36:25.034
We are not Your Lady.
We are Your Majesty.

36:27.704 --> 36:31.941
Your Majesty, your half-brother
Robert of Gloucester

36:31.942 --> 36:34.910
is a prisoner also, held by
what remains of Stephen's army.

36:34.911 --> 36:37.279
His captor, one Richard
of Kingsbridge,

36:37.280 --> 36:39.014
a blood-thirsty fellow.

36:39.015 --> 36:41.484
I regret to say
we know him well.

36:41.485 --> 36:44.720
If Stephen hangs,
Gloucester will hang higher.

36:44.721 --> 36:46.222
You can save him.

36:47.224 --> 36:48.858
By trusting you?

36:48.859 --> 36:51.260
We are closer in sympathy
to Your Majesty

36:51.261 --> 36:52.962
than Your Majesty might guess.

36:52.963 --> 36:55.931
I was your brother's confessor,

36:55.932 --> 36:59.635
and Lady Regan served
in waiting to his wife.

36:59.636 --> 37:01.103
Yes.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.174
I remember you.

37:07.911 --> 37:10.913
I remember your face.

37:12.983 --> 37:16.785
My brother the Prince and
his wife died in a shipwreck,

37:16.786 --> 37:19.722
the one that started
this war of succession.

37:19.723 --> 37:22.258
No one survived.

37:22.259 --> 37:25.794
Weren't you supposed to
be on board with them?

37:25.795 --> 37:29.532
Your Majesty, I was sent
ahead in another ship

37:29.533 --> 37:31.901
with my young son,
who is with me today.

37:31.902 --> 37:33.102
Your Majesty.

37:33.103 --> 37:34.436
Who sent you ahead?

37:34.437 --> 37:36.939
Why, your brother, the prince.

37:36.940 --> 37:40.342
I was bringing good news
to the king, your father.

37:40.343 --> 37:43.279
My Lady, the Princess,
was at last with child.

37:45.115 --> 37:47.316
Why didn't we learn of this?

37:47.317 --> 37:49.485
News of the shipwreck
reached the courts

37:49.486 --> 37:51.420
before I did, Your Majesty.

37:51.421 --> 37:54.823
I saw no reason to burden
your father any further.

37:55.892 --> 37:58.193
What else are you
hiding from us?

37:58.194 --> 38:00.062
Why nothing, Your Majesty.

38:02.065 --> 38:06.035
Then why did you side
with Stephen against us?

38:08.271 --> 38:09.772
(Whispering):
William.

38:11.174 --> 38:13.509
I was raised at court,
Your Majesty,

38:13.510 --> 38:17.546
and my parents were told that
if they did not support Stephen,

38:17.547 --> 38:19.181
I would be killed.

38:19.182 --> 38:22.818
Your Majesty has
a beloved only son as I do.

38:22.819 --> 38:25.220
What would a mother not do

38:25.221 --> 38:27.756
in order to spare his life?

38:37.167 --> 38:39.034
Very well.

38:39.035 --> 38:43.138
You may deal with this
Richard of Kingsbridge

38:43.139 --> 38:45.474
and exchange our
dear Gloucester's life

38:45.475 --> 38:47.910
for that of the
traitor Stephen's.

38:47.911 --> 38:50.646
I assume they would
accept no less.

38:50.647 --> 38:53.515
Our secretary, Father Francis,
will accompany you.

38:54.718 --> 38:58.220
Your beloved only son, however,

38:58.221 --> 39:01.256
will remain here as collateral.

39:01.257 --> 39:04.860
Any hint of treachery
on your part

39:04.861 --> 39:07.429
and I'll have your balls
on a platter...

39:08.431 --> 39:10.099
all 6 of them.

39:14.971 --> 39:17.006
(Screaming)

39:21.978 --> 39:23.946
I'm here to see
the usurper Stephen

39:23.947 --> 39:25.581
at the command of the Queen.

39:30.620 --> 39:33.088
(Man 1): Hey!
Bring that through!

39:34.724 --> 39:36.492
Hey, give me the key!

39:36.493 --> 39:37.626
No!

39:37.627 --> 39:40.062
(Man 2):
Hurry up with them, OK?

39:46.369 --> 39:47.770
(Man 3):
Round them up!

39:47.771 --> 39:49.505
You must understand,
Your Majesty,

39:49.506 --> 39:51.807
we only side with
Maud to help you.

39:51.808 --> 39:53.475
Once you regain your throne...

39:53.476 --> 39:55.377
I'll see her dead.

39:55.378 --> 39:57.446
In time...

39:57.447 --> 39:59.281
Majesty.

39:59.282 --> 40:00.382
(Man screaming)

40:00.383 --> 40:01.650
But first...

40:02.686 --> 40:04.820
she requires your allegiance

40:04.821 --> 40:08.190
and public acknowledgment
of her as Queen.

40:08.191 --> 40:09.958
That will never happen.

40:15.732 --> 40:17.599
Rest assured,

40:19.069 --> 40:23.005
whatever is writ today
can be scratched tomorrow.

40:23.006 --> 40:24.540
May I tell her you accept?

40:26.910 --> 40:28.744
I'd rather hang.

40:28.745 --> 40:30.412
Then you will.

40:31.648 --> 40:33.916
Once her torturers
have finished with you,

40:33.917 --> 40:36.685
you will beg for her
forgiveness from the scaffold,

40:36.686 --> 40:38.087
your neck will snap

40:38.088 --> 40:40.089
and you will foul yourself.

40:42.459 --> 40:44.059
Nothing noble in a hanging.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.894
(Man 1): Hey!
Bring that through!

40:49.833 --> 40:51.967
Do what you must.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.176
In taking my leave,

41:01.177 --> 41:03.779
I must perform an
unfortunate familiarity.

41:05.315 --> 41:07.182
(Spits)

41:17.293 --> 41:20.229
Do you see that priest there?

41:20.230 --> 41:22.965
He's the one who betrayed
Bartholomew of Shiring,

41:22.966 --> 41:24.333
the Queen's friend,

41:24.334 --> 41:26.034
to Stephen, the usurper.

41:26.035 --> 41:28.337
If you can get him
to admit to this,

41:28.338 --> 41:30.205
she will be very, very happy.

41:33.743 --> 41:34.910
(Grunting)

41:34.911 --> 41:36.278
Come on.

41:46.589 --> 41:48.056
(Giggles)

41:48.057 --> 41:50.325
All the fleece
that's fallen out of sacks,

41:50.326 --> 41:51.560
put in the basket.

41:51.561 --> 41:53.562
Last year when we did this,

41:53.563 --> 41:55.330
we ended up with
half a sack extra.

41:55.331 --> 41:56.431
The profits are yours.

41:56.432 --> 41:57.432
Oh, thank you!

42:01.471 --> 42:03.038
Alfred.

42:03.039 --> 42:04.339
What's wrong?

42:04.340 --> 42:06.308
We received news from Lincoln.

42:06.309 --> 42:08.544
- It's Richard.
T-t-tell me it's not Richard.

42:08.545 --> 42:10.579
No, Richard is well.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.548
It is he who sent word.

42:13.850 --> 42:15.217
The King's army is fallen

42:15.218 --> 42:16.251
and Maud now rules.

42:16.252 --> 42:17.753
But...

42:17.754 --> 42:19.021
Prior Philip?

42:19.022 --> 42:21.223
Captured, not dead.

42:21.224 --> 42:23.225
He's among those
to be ransomed.

42:23.226 --> 42:24.493
(Breathing unevenly)

42:24.494 --> 42:26.028
Oh god!

42:26.029 --> 42:28.764
It is Jack who is dead.

42:28.765 --> 42:30.465
(Crying)

42:39.409 --> 42:41.476
(Inhaling)

42:42.445 --> 42:43.979
(Sighing)

42:54.490 --> 42:56.892
(Sizzling, groaning)

42:58.261 --> 42:59.761
(Panting)

42:59.762 --> 43:01.129
It's easy, Philip.

43:01.130 --> 43:02.798
You're an honest man.

43:02.799 --> 43:05.634
It's easy for an honest man
to tell the truth.

43:05.635 --> 43:08.437
All you have say is that
you betrayed Bartholomew,

43:08.438 --> 43:11.373
and ruined Maud's chances
of an early victory.

43:11.374 --> 43:13.408
Say it. It's easy.

43:16.312 --> 43:17.379
(Sizzling)

43:17.380 --> 43:18.413
(Groaning)

43:18.414 --> 43:19.982
I... I... I... I...

43:19.983 --> 43:21.450
(Gasping)

43:21.451 --> 43:23.852
I beg God to give me strength.

43:23.853 --> 43:25.053
(Sizzling)

43:25.054 --> 43:26.488
(Groaning)

43:26.489 --> 43:29.024
Spare yourself, Philip.
You're not a martyr.

43:29.025 --> 43:31.860
And you are not the Church!

43:31.861 --> 43:34.730
(Sizzling and screaming)

43:34.731 --> 43:36.265
Yes! Yes!

43:36.266 --> 43:37.666
Yes!

43:37.667 --> 43:39.434
(Panting)

43:39.435 --> 43:41.837
I betrayed Bartholomew...

43:41.838 --> 43:43.071
to you,

43:43.072 --> 43:44.840
and you're the one
who betrayed Maud.

43:46.876 --> 43:48.610
He has confessed.

43:48.611 --> 43:50.112
(Gasping)

43:50.113 --> 43:51.513
He is a traitor.

43:56.986 --> 43:58.987
See that he's hanged.

43:58.988 --> 44:00.389
Yes, Your Eminence.

44:05.361 --> 44:08.263
In order to conserve
expenditures

44:08.264 --> 44:09.731
and, God-willing,

44:09.732 --> 44:13.969
meet the ransom demands
for our good prior,

44:13.970 --> 44:16.138
I, as sub-prior,

44:16.139 --> 44:19.808
order all work on the
Kingsbridge cathedral

44:19.809 --> 44:21.376
to be stopped.

44:21.377 --> 44:23.879
(All grumbling)

44:30.520 --> 44:32.020
He's not dead.

44:33.056 --> 44:34.990
I would know it
if he were dead.

44:35.992 --> 44:37.359
He can't be dead.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.628
I don't allow him to be dead.

44:39.629 --> 44:42.531
I dreamed this would happen
and I didn't stop it.

44:42.532 --> 44:43.966
(Sobs)

44:44.968 --> 44:47.436
Why? It makes no
bloody sense!

44:47.437 --> 44:49.171
It doesn't have to make sense.

44:49.172 --> 44:50.839
This is part of
God's plan and...

44:50.840 --> 44:51.807
God's plan?

44:52.875 --> 44:53.976
If God has a plan,

44:53.977 --> 44:56.244
it's not working out
very well, is it?

44:58.781 --> 45:01.216
(Sobbing)

45:15.965 --> 45:18.133
(Man):
Hang the traitors!

45:21.371 --> 45:23.405
Bring out the rest of them!

45:30.980 --> 45:33.782
Make your peace with God, man.

45:41.591 --> 45:43.592
