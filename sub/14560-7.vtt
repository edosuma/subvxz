WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:12.080
*

00:12.113 --> 00:15.516
* Careless
in our summer clothes *

00:15.549 --> 00:21.322
* Splashing around in the muck
and the mire *

00:23.124 --> 00:26.360
* Careless
in our summer clothes *

00:26.394 --> 00:32.200
* Splashing around in the muck
and the mire *

00:33.301 --> 00:36.170
* Now, hang me up to dry...

00:36.204 --> 00:37.738
MAN (over radio):
The National Weather Service

00:37.771 --> 00:40.274
has issued a high surf advisory

00:40.308 --> 00:42.076
for Southern
and Central California.

00:42.110 --> 00:45.313
Large swells generated by a
powerful North Pacific storm

00:45.346 --> 00:47.181
will approach
the California coast

00:47.215 --> 00:49.150
during the next 24 hours.

00:49.183 --> 00:53.987
* I'm pearly like the white,
the whites of your eyes *

00:57.858 --> 00:59.760
These swells will cause
dangerous high surf

00:59.793 --> 01:02.630
along all west-
and northwest-facing beaches.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.698
Beachgoers should be vigilant

01:04.732 --> 01:06.534
in avoiding
large breaking waves.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.369
Idiots.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.837
Inexperienced surfers
and swimmers

01:09.870 --> 01:11.505
are urged to stay
out of the water

01:11.539 --> 01:14.508
until these hazardous
surf conditions subside.

01:24.385 --> 01:27.521
* Now hang me up to dry

01:27.555 --> 01:34.762
* You've wrung me out
too, too, too many times *

01:34.795 --> 01:39.500
* Now hang me out to dry

01:39.533 --> 01:45.339
* I'm pearly like the white,
the whites of your eyes *

01:46.674 --> 01:49.710
* Now hang me out to dry.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.823
Nathan!

02:29.550 --> 02:30.918
He wasn't a daredevil.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.386
He needed
to be in control.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.721
I know, I... I knew Nathan.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.889
He... He was like that
even as a kid.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.625
(door opening)

02:37.658 --> 02:39.527
Oh, hey, Keith.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.928
I am so sorry.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.332
CHARLIE:
Hey, Keith, sorry.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.733
Thanks.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.370
Saw that piece in the Times.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.872
CHARLIE: It must be some comfort
knowing that he died

02:51.905 --> 02:52.940
doing what he loved.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.508
Yeah, and in the...

02:54.542 --> 02:55.643
the place that
he loved.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.577
DON:
The high dive.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.845
When we were kids,

02:57.878 --> 02:59.647
I'd be up there doing back flips

02:59.680 --> 03:01.949
off of the thing
and Nathan would be

03:01.982 --> 03:03.751
- frozen stiff.
- CHARLIE: I remember that.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.853
I jumped in
before he did.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.854
He told me

03:06.887 --> 03:08.222
that I had courage.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.523
He used a more
colorful term.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.525
(chuckling)

03:12.760 --> 03:14.328
Don...

03:14.362 --> 03:16.597
I was hoping
you'd look into it--

03:16.630 --> 03:17.531
Nate's death.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.734
CHARLIE:
Keith,

03:20.768 --> 03:21.935
wasn't it an accident?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.004
His thing for big waves...

03:24.037 --> 03:25.339
you know, it wasn't

03:25.373 --> 03:26.474
a death wish.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.709
He never took
stupid chances.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.379
The bigger the surf, the
more cautious he got.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.615
He had enemies
in the Channel Islands.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.317
Some of the people
he arrested.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.551
He told me he had threats.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.722
You know, Keith, if it looked
like a crime at all,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.391
we would be all over it.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.327
Yeah, sure.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.495
Yeah, I understand.

03:47.528 --> 03:51.265
Yeah, well, maybe you can,
uh, take a look at the file,

03:51.299 --> 03:52.966
see if they haven't
overlooked anything.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.935
Yeah, I mean, we could do that.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.337
Absolutely.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.581
Hey, man, I didn't know you
were into surf videos.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.717
I grew up with this guy.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.619
Really, you grew up
with Nathan Watts?

04:11.652 --> 04:14.388
Yeah, played baseball together.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.690
Look at that, just a born
athlete. Yeah, man,

04:16.724 --> 04:18.025
you could see that
when he competed.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.927
This guy could out-hustle
anybody in a heat.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.595
What do you know
about it, Idaho?

04:21.629 --> 04:24.532
I learned when I was on Oahu
at Schofield.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.033
I mean, I got all right at it.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.635
You know, nothing
like this guy.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.837
This guy was nuts,
huge cojones.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.572
- Yeah, I'll say.
- When he dropped

04:31.605 --> 04:34.308
off the pro tour and took that
Channel Islands ranger job--

04:34.342 --> 04:35.843
must have been
like five years ago now--

04:35.876 --> 04:37.545
the surf mags
were all over it,

04:37.578 --> 04:40.013
how he was out there surfing
these giant, perfect waves

04:40.047 --> 04:41.982
by himself.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.452
You got anything to it?

04:44.485 --> 04:45.553
I'd say
Park Service

04:45.586 --> 04:46.820
looks like they did a good job.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.689
Blow to the head matches
a dent in the board.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.090
He's got fiberglass
in his hair.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.059
Swell of the decade.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.827
He wipes out
and gets conked and drowns.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.496
What a waste.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.569
Wait a minute, man, Nathan Watts
wasn't a goofy foot.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.036
I remember 'cause there
was this famous shot

05:03.070 --> 05:05.839
of him pig-dogging
this backside rail grab drop

05:05.873 --> 05:07.040
on the left at Mav's.

05:07.074 --> 05:07.908
Goofy what?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.943
He surfs with his
left foot forward,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.044
which means
that he'd put his leash

05:11.078 --> 05:13.080
on his right ankle.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.715
That's the wrong ankle.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.984
I mean, you always put
your leash on your back foot.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.086
Always, unless you're
a beginner.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.488
Someone put it on him?

05:22.756 --> 05:23.724
Not a beginner.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.439
If you had to
label Watts,

05:38.472 --> 05:40.741
would you, uh, call him
a cop or a surfer?

05:40.774 --> 05:43.477
Oh, he'd have called
himself a surfer, for sure.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.513
Most surfers do.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.849
Nathan was a serious ranger,
especially when it came

05:48.882 --> 05:50.684
to protecting the
Channel Islands.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.785
He loved this place

05:51.819 --> 05:53.554
like nobody
I've ever seen.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.756
Made a lot of busts,
including some folks

05:55.789 --> 05:57.625
maybe shouldn't
have been busted.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.059
- Yeah?
- Thing about having

05:59.092 --> 06:00.828
a giant moat
surround your park...

06:00.861 --> 06:02.730
- cuts down on the crime.
- Even this close to L.A.?

06:02.763 --> 06:03.964
As far as L.A.
is concerned,

06:03.997 --> 06:05.733
might as well be the moon.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.535
Suppose that's a good thing.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.936
We've got five islands,

06:08.969 --> 06:10.438
hundred and some-odd
thousand acres,

06:10.471 --> 06:11.839
no roads.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.607
Got endangered
species,

06:13.641 --> 06:15.576
burial sites,
a marine sanctuary.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.044
But most of
our visitors

06:17.077 --> 06:19.413
are the kind that tread lightly.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.048
We get a few idiots,
but compared

06:21.081 --> 06:22.883
to other national
parks, this place

06:22.916 --> 06:23.884
is a church.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.085
One question for you.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.020
Who was Watts busting

06:27.054 --> 06:29.823
if there wasn't anybody
out here to bust?

06:29.857 --> 06:30.858
Otter killers.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.626
- Ought to what?
- Don't.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.127
We did the Marx Brothers
thing already.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.763
Sea otters-- they're
federally protected.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.598
Nathan saw a couple
of urchin divers

06:37.631 --> 06:38.699
gun one down offshore.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.601
NIKKI: Yeah, Nathan busts them,

06:40.634 --> 06:41.902
the divers made threats.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.771
Yeah, these guys work
out of Ventura Harbor,

06:43.804 --> 06:45.105
so I figured
we'd head up there.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.206
(door opening)

06:46.239 --> 06:47.007
DON:
What's up?

06:47.040 --> 06:47.841
Hey, Don.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.843
CHARLIE:
Here's what I was thinking.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.779
With the proper data,

06:51.812 --> 06:54.214
I should be able to pinpoint
where he drowned.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.616
It's just a
relatively simple

06:55.649 --> 06:56.850
analysis of
near-shore currents.

06:56.884 --> 06:57.651
It might help.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.487
DON: All right,
that sounds good.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.721
And, uh, David's
on his way back,

07:00.754 --> 07:03.724
so I think I'll go see if I
can find, uh, Melissa Conroy.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.660
Melissa Conroy?

07:06.694 --> 07:07.628
COLBY:
Nathan's girlfriend.

07:07.661 --> 07:11.665
Surf instructor
and part-time bikini model.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.834
Nice of him to take
the tougher interview.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.579
Took me years to coax him
into the water.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.147
Scared him bad
at first.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.550
Well, he clearly
outgrew that.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.019
After the divorce,
that's when it changed.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.054
He'd paddle out on days

07:34.087 --> 07:36.924
that would scare
the hell out of me.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.894
It would be a different world
if I hadn't torpedoed it.

07:40.928 --> 07:44.532
Cecilia and me.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.833
The marriage.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.968
Oh, so he didn't have a
fairy-tale childhood.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.670
I mean, who does?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.641
He was a good boy;
a good man.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.075
Because of you.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.912
I'm not sure I buy it,
but thanks.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.984
Well, stuff rubs off
on our kids.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.520
Most of the time,
we don't even know what stuff.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.992
NIKKI: How could anyone kill a
sea otter?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.260
They're so cute.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.829
The little whiskers;
little smile.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.064
Little teeth.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.566
Those things are voracious.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.768
They'll eat like 50 sea urchins
in a day.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.303
50 urchins--
one otter?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.172
Yeah, which is why
the urchin divers

08:25.205 --> 08:27.875
don't get too weepy
when one turns up dead.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.778
Problem is, they were almost
wiped out for their fur coats,

08:30.811 --> 08:32.713
so Fish and Game
transplanted a few dozen

08:32.746 --> 08:34.815
to the Channel Islands
to try and repopulate.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.017
And these guys
get caught

08:37.050 --> 08:39.787
trying to take out
the competition.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.088
Hey, guys, FBI--
need to talk

08:41.121 --> 08:42.556
to you for
a minute.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.291
Go, go, go, come on,
come on, come on!

08:49.930 --> 08:51.899
Come on, come on.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.805
Oh, whoa. No, no, no ,no!

09:00.908 --> 09:02.142
Thanks for running.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.812
It's easier to tell
who's guilty that way.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.913
Turn around.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.881
(camera clicking)

09:09.182 --> 09:10.183
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, my God...

09:11.685 --> 09:13.954
(sighing)

09:13.987 --> 09:16.657
Like that.
Better.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.125
This is not how you
hold a surfboard.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.727
Why don't you take
a little break,

09:19.760 --> 09:21.294
see if we can come up
with something new.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.930
Let's.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.066
Sorry.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.267
Hack.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.102
That's okay, don't
worry about it.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.304
It sounded on the phone
like you were thinking

09:31.338 --> 09:33.340
maybe this wasn't an accident?

09:33.373 --> 09:35.108
Well, you know,
it's possible.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.944
I mean, I'm just trying
to be thorough.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.012
How long
were you guys together?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.814
Couple of years.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.683
You spend a lot of time out
there?

09:42.716 --> 09:43.784
Wasn't really
supposed to,

09:43.817 --> 09:45.786
but you know... love.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.721
It's a beautiful
place.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.723
We pretty much had
it to ourselves.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.791
Not many visitors,
anything like that?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.192
This guy making a movie

09:52.225 --> 09:55.295
about big-wave riders
came out once, did an interview.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.097
Surprised me
'cause Nathan usually

09:57.130 --> 09:58.799
gave the finger to
the surf media.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.001
Did he
ever talk about

10:01.034 --> 10:02.703
any crimes or investigations,

10:02.736 --> 10:04.137
- anything like that?
- Not really.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.006
I know he nailed
a few poachers

10:06.039 --> 10:07.374
and sometimes boaters

10:07.407 --> 10:08.709
would come ashore
without permission.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.843
Did he ever tell you

10:09.877 --> 10:12.980
about anyone who might
have a reason to go after him?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.016
We broke up a few months ago.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.885
I haven't been out there

10:17.918 --> 10:19.052
- for a while.
- Yeah?

10:19.086 --> 10:20.921
Different paths, you know?

10:22.055 --> 10:22.856
Nathan lived
the life

10:22.890 --> 10:25.693
that surfers pretend
to dream about,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.394
but don't really want.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.396
He hates this stuff.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.765
You mean all the PR,
stuff like that?

10:31.799 --> 10:33.133
Nathan had a lot
of words for it.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.835
Riding waves,

10:34.868 --> 10:36.436
living in the ocean...

10:36.469 --> 10:38.906
it was like a
religion almost.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.142
That's why he moved
off the grid.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.078
But... a girl's got to eat,

10:45.112 --> 10:47.247
and Nathan,
he wasn't gonna feed me.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.016
I had to choose.

10:49.049 --> 10:52.252
His world
or the real world.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.921
How about we
lose the board?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
Fine.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.164
COLBY:
So your urchin

11:04.197 --> 11:04.865
license has been pulled.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.734
But somehow your
hold is full

11:06.767 --> 11:08.268
of spiny round
purple things.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.004
Well, no license doesn't mean
I don't got a mortgage to pay.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.006
You must've been
plenty pissed off

11:13.040 --> 11:14.341
when Nathan ran you in.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.076
Pissed don't
cover it.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.711
Like getting busted
for killing a rodent.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.713
They're in the weasel family--
otters.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.782
When was the last time
you saw him?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.350
Hell, I don't know.
When'd he pop us?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.352
It must've made your life
a whole lot easier

11:25.385 --> 11:26.787
when Watts turned up dead.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.790
My kid lost
his medical insurance

11:29.823 --> 11:31.091
'cause of that Nazi.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.293
But I don't go out
to the islands

11:33.326 --> 11:35.328
when the swells
are big...

11:35.362 --> 11:37.197
especially when it happens
the same day

11:37.230 --> 11:39.199
as my wife's birthday party.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.768
Got a computer?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.702
I'll show you the photos
she posted online.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.806
Fish and Game will
chew 'em up,

11:45.839 --> 11:47.808
but these guys didn't
kill any rangers.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.109
NIKKI:
Hey, any luck

11:49.142 --> 11:50.177
on determining
where Nathan died?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.079
No, not yet.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.113
CHARLIE:
Given the complexity

11:53.146 --> 11:54.281
of the currents associated

11:54.314 --> 11:56.449
with this particular part
of the island,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.151
it's actually
a very, very

11:58.185 --> 12:00.220
difficult problem to solve
without any direct data.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.055
We know Nathan was
a big wave surfer,

12:02.089 --> 12:03.523
so can't we assume
that he was

12:03.556 --> 12:04.958
where the biggest waves were
that day?

12:04.992 --> 12:05.793
That's exactly what you said.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.961
So I started building
an analysis

12:07.995 --> 12:10.063
of the wave heights
around that island

12:10.097 --> 12:12.265
on the day that Nathan died.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.967
How can you do that
when the swell's gone?

12:14.001 --> 12:15.402
Magnifying glass.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.904
It's transparent,
right?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.206
But when light passes
through it,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.308
the focal point becomes
encircled by shadow.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.109
You see that there?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.111
The curvature
of the glass bends

12:24.144 --> 12:26.379
and focuses the light waves
away from the dark areas

12:26.413 --> 12:27.815
into that one
blinding point.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.216
COLBY:
There's a science behind

12:29.249 --> 12:31.218
- fried grasshoppers.
- Ocean waves

12:31.251 --> 12:32.452
are quite similar
to light waves

12:32.485 --> 12:34.922
in that they can
be refracted or focused.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.957
So, I used
the swell data

12:36.990 --> 12:38.425
from NOAA buoys,
combined that

12:38.458 --> 12:40.160
with detailed
bathymetric readings,

12:40.193 --> 12:42.930
and I was able to create
a color-coded, time-lapse

12:42.963 --> 12:46.399
animation of that swell
on Nathan's island.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.101
Yeah, the surf forecasters
do that on their Web sites.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.102
What do the colors mean?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.237
What are they, wave heights?

12:50.270 --> 12:54.041
Yeah, you see, light blue
means flat or small waves

12:54.074 --> 12:55.308
up to a meter.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.844
Ankle-slappers.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.178
- In surf-speak.
- Thanks.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.347
Yeah, like here--
Kraken Cove...

13:00.380 --> 13:01.882
The ocean was totally flat that
day.

13:01.915 --> 13:02.482
Yeah?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.084
How does that work?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.218
It's the underwater
topography.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.087
Now, purple
are medium waves,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.255
they're up to two meters.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.156
Head-high.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.223
Yellow are big waves,

13:10.257 --> 13:11.558
those are up to
four meters.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.492
Double-overhead.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.262
Red means waves that
are over ten meters.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.397
Those are as high as
five-story buildings.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.398
And what's that in surf-speak?

13:18.431 --> 13:19.532
Clench time.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.434
DON: So this would be the spot

13:21.468 --> 13:22.970
that Nathan found a couple
of years ago, right?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.304
COLBY:
Yeah, that's Wilma's.

13:24.337 --> 13:24.972
And there were a lot of surfers

13:25.005 --> 13:26.606
out at that spot
that day.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.175
And no one saw Nathan.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.542
All right, so...

13:29.576 --> 13:31.144
Where was he?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.513
Charlie?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.448
I'm going to need a more
hands-on approach.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.487
That's surfboard
fiberglass,

13:40.520 --> 13:42.022
hardened
by polyurethane resin.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.256
Found in the victim's
head wound.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.291
We matched it
to the surfboard.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.025
Now look here.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.628
This came
from the same wound.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.998
Small, harder to find, uh,
deeper--

13:51.031 --> 13:52.265
under the surfboard
residue.

13:52.299 --> 13:55.235
That's an aircraft-grade
epoxy-carbon mix.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.637
Well, I seriously doubt he was
hit in the head by an airplane.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.139
Aircraft-grade.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.540
Found in many
products.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.309
We think it came from a paddle.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.510
Like a canoe?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.212
- Kayak, more likely.
- All right,

14:05.245 --> 14:07.080
so he was hit by the paddle,
then he was hit

14:07.114 --> 14:09.282
again by the surfboard to make
it look like an accident.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.922
CHARLIE:
Yeah, yeah, this is weird.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.656
You said
that already.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.191
Yeah, last time
you said that,

14:18.225 --> 14:19.659
we dropped another six
sensors in the ocean.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.129
Well, there's got to be some
factors I'm not accounting for.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.663
I mean, the waves are
still pretty big,

14:23.696 --> 14:26.199
so the currents must be similar
to the way they were before.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.567
What's the glitch?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.669
Well, according to this data
that I'm getting back

14:29.702 --> 14:31.238
from the sensors,

14:31.271 --> 14:32.339
the spot where Nate's body
was found

14:32.372 --> 14:33.506
experienced an eddy effect.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.275
So, his body circled

14:35.308 --> 14:36.944
in the same area for hours.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.078
You're kidding me.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.980
What? What does that mean?

14:40.013 --> 14:42.082
Well, his body was found
in Kraken Cove.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.383
CHARLIE:
And since the current

14:43.416 --> 14:44.217
kept him
in the same place--

14:44.251 --> 14:45.652
that's got to be
where he was killed.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.154
Kraken Cove?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.688
Isn't that the place
where there were no waves?

14:48.721 --> 14:49.589
Exactly.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.258
So you're telling me
the guy who surfed

14:51.291 --> 14:52.459
this island more
than anybody else

14:52.492 --> 14:54.294
paddles out on the
swell of the decade,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.296
with his big-wave board, to
a spot that has no waves?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.632
What the hell was he doing
out there?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.411
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.280
So I tracked down the guy
that interviewed Nathan

15:13.313 --> 15:15.082
for his surf flick--
check this out.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.950
INTERVIEWER: We never see you
out there at Wilma's,

15:16.984 --> 15:18.952
uh, do you ever get
out there anymore?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.688
Yeah, only on the junky
off-days when...

15:21.721 --> 15:23.590
when nobody else wants it,
really.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.393
INTERVIEWER: Must be kind of a
bummer to see this place

15:26.426 --> 15:28.461
that you love so much
turn into a circus.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.662
Oh, it happens.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.698
I mean, really,
there's nothing you can do.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.633
I mean, for me, really,
it's kind of dead.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.603
I heard you, uh, you chased off
a pretty famous tow-in surfer

15:36.636 --> 15:38.671
on the best day of the
year, uh, last winter.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.739
Pat Drummond.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.708
Uh, well, he came...

15:41.741 --> 15:43.643
coming through the line-up
with a Jet Ski.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.612
It's just... that place is
a marine sanctuary.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.647
There's no Jet Skis allowed.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.983
I mean, he's lucky
I didn't arrest him really.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.519
Did you guys have any
sort of altercation?

15:52.552 --> 15:53.753
Nothing physical, but,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.555
uh, definitely something verbal.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.758
- Words were exchanged.
- Words were exchanged.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.726
So, I asked around.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.694
and it turns out that
Nathan and Drummond

16:01.728 --> 16:03.630
were ships
on a collision course.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.165
And the day that Nathan

16:05.198 --> 16:07.167
was killed, Drummond was
completely off the map.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.202
- What do you mean? How so?
- Wasn't there at Wilma's;

16:09.236 --> 16:10.770
wasn't at Maverick's.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.006
Ghost Trees, Todos-- none
of the places he should've been.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.707
Well, so what?
I mean, he could've sat it out.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.708
No.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.045
Big-wave surfer like that,
a swell that big--

16:18.078 --> 16:19.512
there's no way he stayed home.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.314
He's going out,
hunting down big waves,

16:21.348 --> 16:22.515
and getting photographed--

16:22.549 --> 16:24.351
that's how he makes
his sponsors happy.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.419
He's got a little surf shop
out in the Valley.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.687
I figured I'd go surprise him.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.456
All right, that sounds good.

16:29.489 --> 16:33.393
You know, I can't see him
playing baseball.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.694
Yeah, well, neither could he.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.032
Gotta hand it to
him, though.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.601
Sure found a way to get paid
to do what he loved.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.680
Yeah, we had a couple
of confrontations.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.682
But if I got hurt
or something, you know,

16:55.715 --> 16:57.550
I knew Nathan'd help me out.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.252
I'd do the same thing for him.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.088
Even if you hate
a guy, it's...

17:01.121 --> 17:02.222
you know, it's like a code.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.823
I actually drove
my Ski in one time

17:03.856 --> 17:06.559
to grab him before he got washed
up into the rocks at Maverick's.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.794
That was heavy.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.162
You both almost got clipped.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.398
And where were you
on the 18th--

17:11.431 --> 17:12.632
the day of the big swell?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.634
Ready to kill myself.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.070
Yeah, we tried like hell to
get out to Channel Islands

17:17.104 --> 17:19.706
that day, but, uh,
our engine died.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.709
And, uh, we ended up at Rincon,
of all places, just before dark.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.744
Rincon must've
been crowded.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.347
No, not as bad
as you'd think.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.082
Even a zoo like Rincon,

17:29.116 --> 17:30.583
a triple-overhead swell--
it's gonna thin the herd.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.851
Clench time.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.719
You surf?

17:39.326 --> 17:43.096
Charles, did you
know that a cork

17:43.130 --> 17:46.533
bobbing on the ocean describes
a near-perfect circle

17:46.566 --> 17:48.201
when a wave passes beneath it?

17:48.235 --> 17:49.769
I did know that.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.672
And that same cork

17:52.705 --> 17:54.841
will return to its original
position no matter

17:54.874 --> 17:58.178
how high the wave--
one foot, hundred feet,

17:58.211 --> 18:00.113
because the ocean is merely
the medium.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.349
Waves aren't the result
of moving water,

18:02.382 --> 18:04.184
they're the result of energy
moving through water.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.118
That's that.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.454
So is it also fair to say
that ocean waves

18:07.487 --> 18:11.458
resemble sound waves, light
waves? That's fair, yes.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.860
Sound waves travel
at 761 miles per hour.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.862
- At sea level.
- Light waves travel at...?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.197
186,000 miles per second.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.266
An ocean wave...
near shore...

18:19.299 --> 18:22.902
moves at just about the same
speed as that of a running man.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.773
Put that man on a surfboard,
on a wave,

18:26.806 --> 18:29.276
and he enjoys
the unique experience

18:29.309 --> 18:32.779
of being propelled
by an individual pulse

18:32.812 --> 18:35.248
of wave energy straight
through the universe.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.850
Given our disparate
investigations--

18:37.884 --> 18:39.552
one cosmic,
one criminal--

18:39.586 --> 18:42.389
might it be in our
joint interests

18:42.422 --> 18:44.657
to spend some time among them.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.494
Uh, time among "them"?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.865
Waves.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.170
KEITH:
If someone would just

18:57.204 --> 18:58.405
say something.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.440
I mean, I don't know
what to believe,

19:00.473 --> 19:01.874
what not to believe.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.743
Hey, Keith, uh,
how old was he here?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.518
Sixteen.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.386
(chuckles)

19:13.420 --> 19:15.388
- It's Baja.
- Mm-hmm.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.424
Our last
father-son trip.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.226
It's strange, you know,

19:19.259 --> 19:21.861
the day you realize your son
surfs better than you do.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.863
You're proud, you know,
but, um...

19:23.896 --> 19:25.865
Mm...
it's humiliating.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.435
Yes, I'm very familiar
with that one.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.203
Charlie was only
four years old

19:30.237 --> 19:32.205
when he first embarrassed me
at chess.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.840
Don, 11, when
he first said

19:33.873 --> 19:38.211
that he needed a "real pitcher"
to toss batting practice.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.948
Don-- he reminds me
of Nate.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.483
Focused.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.218
Fearless.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.721
Yeah, well, maybe a little
too fearless.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.957
- You worry about him?
- No.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.791
What's to worry about?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.460
He only gets shot at
once every week.

19:54.927 --> 19:55.862
Our kids...

19:57.930 --> 19:59.932
...they're not supposed to die
before we do.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.269
It happens, you...

20:02.302 --> 20:03.603
you can't help but think,
you know,

20:03.636 --> 20:05.238
if you'd just done one thing
differently,

20:05.272 --> 20:07.240
he'd still be here.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.941
If I had just called him,
you know, maybe...

20:08.975 --> 20:11.278
Keith, Keith,
you can't go down that path.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.714
This, uh, magical
thinking business.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.249
You...

20:16.283 --> 20:17.650
It was a bad guy.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.388
Nathan was killed by a bad guy.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.390
You know that.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.464
Dorsal not ventral.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.632
What are you
talking about?

20:32.665 --> 20:34.634
I'm fairly certain
the zipper goes in back.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.469
Well, whatever, I...

20:36.503 --> 20:38.905
I know it's
irrational, but...

20:38.938 --> 20:41.641
I can't stifle the image
of, like, a gigantic wave

20:41.674 --> 20:44.377
appearing on the horizon
and crushing us both.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.379
Listen, that fear may not
be totally irrational.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.047
I mean, physical events
can occur

20:48.080 --> 20:51.718
which are beyond our current
ability to explain or quantify.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.954
Yeah, your "meaningful
acausal coincidences."

20:54.987 --> 20:57.524
John Eccles wrote of the
"profound and enduring link

20:57.557 --> 20:59.426
"between the dynamics
of consciousness

20:59.459 --> 21:00.693
and the structure
of the cosmos itself."

21:00.727 --> 21:01.794
Right.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.564
So, in other words,
if I think of a gigantic wave,

21:04.597 --> 21:05.898
I may cause
one to come?

21:05.932 --> 21:07.066
Eh, well, something like that.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.068
Well, fortunately,
the waves look small.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.071
Yeah, I suppose all the real
surfers have ventured elsewhere.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.007
It's nicer this way,
isn't it?

21:15.041 --> 21:17.377
Just kind of having the ocean
all to yourself.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.045
Nathan's life revolved
around that idea--

21:19.078 --> 21:20.713
having the waves to himself.

21:20.747 --> 21:21.581
And when the hordes

21:21.614 --> 21:24.050
descended on a favorite
surfing spot--

21:24.083 --> 21:27.420
a place where he had surfed
alone for ages--

21:27.454 --> 21:29.422
he opted to remain.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.890
It's kind of strange, isn't it?

21:33.025 --> 21:35.695
Maybe not so strange.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.566
Turns out, at least

21:39.599 --> 21:42.735
one of Nathan's enemies was the
focus of a DEA investigation

21:42.769 --> 21:44.637
up until
about six months ago.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.073
Drug task force
had Pat Drummond pegged

21:47.106 --> 21:48.775
as the man behind
a major pot-growing

21:48.808 --> 21:50.076
operation up in Humboldt.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.344
Oh, yeah?
What, the Emerald Triangle?

21:51.378 --> 21:52.612
Yeah. Now, they
couldn't bring

21:52.645 --> 21:54.414
the hammer down.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.314
DEA figures he got spooked,

21:55.348 --> 21:56.883
took his cash and opened up
the shop.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.651
Yeah, word is
he traded in

21:58.685 --> 22:00.387
his overalls,
moved into distribution.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.021
COLBY: Yeah, and here's the
kicker--

22:02.054 --> 22:03.790
local dealers have been buzzing
lately about an influx

22:03.823 --> 22:06.793
of high-grade weed
from the Channel Islands.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.129
We know
that it's all over federal land,

22:10.162 --> 22:11.964
but there's no signs it's moved
out to the Channel Islands--

22:11.998 --> 22:13.833
at least not yet.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.368
Yeah, there's nothing
in Nathan's file

22:15.402 --> 22:16.369
about a marijuana farm.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.904
He never said anything to you?

22:17.937 --> 22:18.905
About pot?

22:18.938 --> 22:19.906
Never.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.708
All right.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.642
Drummond.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.136
Hey.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.742
Whoa.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.877
Look what we got here.

23:01.581 --> 23:05.051
Yep, somebody's bagging up
some pot.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.986
Looks pretty small-time.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.988
(clattering)

23:14.727 --> 23:16.696
(tires screeching)

23:25.872 --> 23:27.840
Hey, dude, gnarly wipeout.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.709
You did not just say that.

23:38.785 --> 23:39.886
Selling pot by the baggie?

23:39.919 --> 23:40.887
That's practically legal
in California

23:40.920 --> 23:42.188
You're in it
up to your neck

23:42.221 --> 23:44.123
- and you don't even know it.
- Right.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.825
All it's gonna take
is us finding Drummond

23:45.858 --> 23:47.026
and him
rolling over on you.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.062
Murdering a federal
law enforcement officer

23:50.096 --> 23:52.699
is not practically legal
anywhere.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.000
Pat was getting weed
from the Channel Islands.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.201
I helped him move it.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.869
I don't know nothing
about how Nathan died.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.004
Drummond have a farm out there?

23:58.037 --> 23:58.871
No.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.973
(pounds table)
No, he ripped it off.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.475
- Which island?
- He never said,

24:02.509 --> 24:03.476
I never asked.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.811
Pot farmers, man.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.179
They're not a bunch
of tie-dyed stoners anymore.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.114
They catch
someone messing

24:08.147 --> 24:10.216
with their plants,
you don't find the body.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.084
- Did Drummond kill Nathan?
- I don't know.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.086
He went out there that day,
during the swell,

24:14.120 --> 24:15.888
the day Nathan died.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.157
Got back late in the afternoon,
was all, like, panicked.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.693
Was all, "Let's get out of here,
go to Rincon."

24:22.094 --> 24:24.797
Remote public lands
in Southern California--

24:24.831 --> 24:27.133
that's where most pot in
the state is grown these days.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.100
Couple of years ago,

24:28.134 --> 24:30.870
National Park Services
raided 250 pot farms

24:30.903 --> 24:33.039
on California
parkland alone,

24:33.072 --> 24:34.774
and not all mom-and-pop either.

24:34.807 --> 24:35.808
You got booby
traps, guns...

24:35.842 --> 24:37.109
COLBY:
And very few arrests.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.545
I mean, the main guy'll
generally hire

24:38.578 --> 24:40.246
a bunch of illegals
to do the grunt work,

24:40.279 --> 24:42.081
and then
if the farm gets raided

24:42.114 --> 24:44.250
and the workers get arrested,
he's still protected.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.085
And even if they do bust
the ringleader,

24:46.118 --> 24:49.789
he skirts property-forfeiture
law because he used public lands

24:49.822 --> 24:51.223
- instead of his own backyard.
- But I don't see

24:51.257 --> 24:52.959
anything here saying
it was definitely being grown

24:52.992 --> 24:53.960
on the Channel Islands.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.562
WILSON:
Not yet.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.864
Done some flyovers, but there's
an awful lot of terrain.

24:57.897 --> 24:58.865
Very few roads.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.099
Well, you know,
I've consulted

25:00.132 --> 25:01.300
with Homeland Security
in their attempts

25:01.333 --> 25:03.069
to locate specific plant types

25:03.102 --> 25:04.571
using airborne spectral-
sensing equipment

25:04.604 --> 25:07.874
combined with a cultivation-site
prediction model.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.742
Specific plants.
You mean...

25:09.776 --> 25:12.211
The kind used
to make illegal drugs.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.846
Well, keep working that, and I
guess we should re-interview

25:13.880 --> 25:15.181
some of these people, huh?

25:15.214 --> 25:18.017
You guys want to fight it
out for Melissa Conroy?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.254
DAVID: I always lose
when we do that.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.856
You know?
I think you cheat.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.793
- How do you cheat at roshambo?
- DON: Hold on, hold on.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.060
Let's see. Maybe Charlie...

25:28.094 --> 25:29.629
Well, no, uh,
I wouldn't call it cheating.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.163
But chaos
school advocates

25:31.197 --> 25:32.999
a purely random distribution
of rock, paper, scissor,

25:33.032 --> 25:34.300
while probability analysis

25:34.333 --> 25:35.935
has shown
that a mixed strategy

25:35.968 --> 25:37.069
of preconceived
gambits...

25:37.103 --> 25:38.170
You know what?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.238
(chuckles)

25:39.271 --> 25:41.273
I'm gonna keep my roshambo
strategies to myself,

25:41.307 --> 25:42.909
just in case I have
to throw down

25:42.942 --> 25:44.143
with one of you guys someday.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.748
Did he just say "throw down"?

25:50.783 --> 25:52.752
KEITH:
Marijuana.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.253
O-On the Channel Islands.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.155
Yeah, I mean,
I have to ask.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.657
- Is there a chance...?
- That Nate was involved

25:57.690 --> 25:59.692
- in some pot farm? No, no way.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.526
Don!

26:00.559 --> 26:01.160
Look, I know that you didn't
agree

26:01.193 --> 26:02.762
with some of his choices.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.630
Keith, that's not what this is
about.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.331
He was a priest
when it came to drugs!

26:05.364 --> 26:07.166
You ask anybody
who knew him.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.235
And that's the way I read it,
too, but I have to ask.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.870
I mean, you asked me
to look into this.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.371
You're wasting your time, Don.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.674
That's what you're doing,
you're wasting your time.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.308
Keith, he's trying
to find your son's killer.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.710
He has to look under every rug.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.978
Now, that's what he does.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.684
I'm sorry.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.254
I know, I know.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.789
If someone made

26:29.822 --> 26:32.224
the same accusation
about one of your boys...

26:32.258 --> 26:34.627
Good point.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.933
LARRY:
Huh.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.069
The spectral range of
a marijuana leaf is...

26:43.102 --> 26:44.336
Is often
not that different

26:44.370 --> 26:46.205
than native species
growing nearby,

26:46.238 --> 26:47.707
and that's why it's so hard,

26:47.740 --> 26:49.208
using spectral imaging,
to pinpoint them.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.110
So, deconvolution algorithms?

26:51.143 --> 26:52.378
Yeah,
I combined those

26:52.411 --> 26:53.445
with the hyperspectral
aerial images.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.248
I mean, I was able
to identify several large areas

26:56.282 --> 26:58.284
on that island that might
contain marijuana fields.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.687
That is a lot of land.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.321
I know, I know.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.422
I need a new idea.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.425
Well, I'm thinking maybe
we need to go surfing again.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.194
Did we surf?

27:08.227 --> 27:10.663
'Cause I wouldn't
call it that.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.331
I feel like we kind of
just bobbed in place.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.733
Yeah, I think
maybe we were

27:13.766 --> 27:15.434
more like buoys.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.970
Yeah, like...

27:18.004 --> 27:20.206
like buoys.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.986
Dude.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.358
I thought models didn't need
to have real jobs.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.260
NIKKI: L.A.'s a competitive
market for hotties.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.163
If you stop at your
knees like this,

27:44.196 --> 27:45.464
you'll never get all the way up.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.934
Words to live by.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.837
I'll be
right back.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.439
I already talked
to some FBI guy.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.774
Yeah, he sent us.

27:54.807 --> 27:55.808
Did Nathan ever
mention anything

27:55.842 --> 27:57.043
about a potential
marijuana bust?

27:57.076 --> 27:58.344
Pot?

27:58.377 --> 27:59.178
No.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.847
How often did you visit
the island?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.215
When Nathan first
got the job, a lot--

28:03.249 --> 28:05.084
like, every couple weeks.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.786
Less toward the end.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.888
I'd always hoped
it was a temporary thing,

28:08.921 --> 28:10.189
him living out there.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.759
Turned out he wasn't
going anywhere.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.326
- He have other visitors?
- Not really.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.829
Nathan was the kind
who didn't mind being alone.

28:16.863 --> 28:17.696
Look, I'm sorry.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.099
I don't know anything
about pot farms

28:20.132 --> 28:22.301
or any stuff like that.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.036
I better get back
before they bail.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.205
Sure.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.347
You say anything
about pot farms?

28:35.381 --> 28:36.515
Nope.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.950
Me neither.

28:37.984 --> 28:41.353
INTERVIEWER: This is a painful
question, but it's something

28:41.387 --> 28:44.490
everyone's asked about,
and you and the tour and...

28:44.523 --> 28:46.258
people really want to know
why you dropped off.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.960
NATHAN:
I just lost interest.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.261
INTERVIEWER:
Tahiti, Indo, J-Bay--

28:49.295 --> 28:51.764
I mean, how do you
lose interest in that?

28:51.798 --> 28:52.965
NATHAN:
I mean, the truth is

28:52.999 --> 28:54.901
I just got tired
of surfing for points.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.069
INTERVIEWER: You know, all kinds
of pros these days--

28:57.103 --> 28:59.806
they don't surf contests,
but they still make good money.

28:59.839 --> 29:03.042
Well, really, I got tired
of surfing for the corporations,

29:03.075 --> 29:06.345
like selling their T-shirts
and flip-flops and...

29:06.378 --> 29:10.482
the little watches
with the tide calendars.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.051
The only reason
to turn pro is to...

29:12.084 --> 29:14.520
surf good waves
and get paid for it.

29:14.553 --> 29:17.790
I mean, out here, I get
all the good waves I want.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.860
I get paid to protect
a beautiful, spiritual place.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.394
INTERVIEWER:
You got to be stoked on that.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.096
NATHAN:
Yeah.

29:24.130 --> 29:24.964
INTERVIEWER: There was this
rumor that you had

29:24.997 --> 29:26.132
a fear of big waves.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.400
So how did you overcome
that fear?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.969
NATHAN:
Well, when I was a kid, I was--

29:30.002 --> 29:33.005
I mean, the ocean scared me
to death.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.374
It was my dad
who got me into the water,

29:35.407 --> 29:37.409
taught me how waves work,

29:37.443 --> 29:39.378
how to relax when things go bad.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.448
You just-- you really have
to just go out there and do it.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.084
Be alone and, um,

29:45.117 --> 29:46.285
you make a lot of mistakes,

29:46.318 --> 29:48.420
and those mistakes

29:48.454 --> 29:50.122
are things that you learn--
you learn from that.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.490
That's why someone can't just...

29:51.523 --> 29:54.460
be a good surfer in six months.

29:54.493 --> 29:58.164
But if it weren't
for my old man, I mean,

29:58.197 --> 30:00.499
I'd probably be driving
a bread truck in Wichita.

30:00.532 --> 30:01.934
(interviewer laughing)

30:09.208 --> 30:10.977
CHARLIE:
So, my initial analysis--

30:11.010 --> 30:15.081
a relatively simple filtering
of hyperspectral images--

30:15.114 --> 30:16.582
produced several large
areas on the island

30:16.615 --> 30:18.584
that most likely
contain marijuana farms.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.519
That's still a lot
of ground to cover.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.488
Hence the term "initial."
It occurred to me

30:22.521 --> 30:26.125
that spectral images
are merely an imprint

30:26.158 --> 30:28.127
of electromagnetic waves--

30:28.160 --> 30:29.595
in this case, light
reflecting off of leaves--

30:29.628 --> 30:31.463
and as we know, light
waves work the same

30:31.497 --> 30:33.065
as ocean waves.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.533
And as with all waves,

30:34.566 --> 30:37.036
it's very difficult to detect
a significant pattern--

30:37.069 --> 30:39.138
what surfers like to call
the dominant swell--

30:39.171 --> 30:40.572
amid other swells.

30:40.606 --> 30:44.010
Now, what surf forecasters do
is they use math

30:44.043 --> 30:47.479
to filter out noise
of surface chop from buoy data

30:47.513 --> 30:50.016
to detect
serious ground swells.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.118
In a fundamental way,
it's similar

30:52.151 --> 30:56.488
to how polarized sunglasses
filter out reflected sunlight.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.160
So I applied a
deconvolution operator

31:01.193 --> 31:02.494
to filter out
spectral interference

31:02.528 --> 31:03.595
from other plants known

31:03.629 --> 31:05.097
to grow on
the Channel Islands,

31:05.131 --> 31:06.432
and then created a neural
network algorithm

31:06.465 --> 31:09.168
to learn to recognize
known spectral patterns

31:09.201 --> 31:10.302
based on training sets.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.537
(chuckling):
That was the cool part.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.973
Yeah. Sounds cool.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.674
Anyway, um...

31:15.707 --> 31:17.910
(typing)

31:17.944 --> 31:19.578
There's your marijuana farm.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.513
Five miles from Kraken Cove.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.545
*

32:20.739 --> 32:24.476
*

32:44.763 --> 32:45.797
NIKKI:
Not exactly organic.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.167
Better bag anything that
even looks like evidence.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.046
Already harvested.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.067
You guys, over here.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.803
Kind of looks
like evidence, huh?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.405
NIKKI:
He was shot.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.074
Execution style.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.241
Hmm.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.609
Take a look at this.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.347
Maybe he was planning
on opening up a second store--

33:35.381 --> 33:36.348
Drummond's Surf and Toke, huh?

33:36.382 --> 33:37.383
Looks like
our guy here

33:37.416 --> 33:40.652
was trying to mix
some business with pleasure.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.388
Seems he missed out
on the pleasure part.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.589
Yeah, we'll
turn it over

33:43.622 --> 33:45.624
to the techs-- maybe they'll be
able to tell us something.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.760
Wait a minute.
Maybe it already has.

33:48.794 --> 33:49.795
DAVID:
Ah.

33:58.137 --> 34:01.073
This is a clean-air thing,
I just got certified.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.142
Nope. Nothing
like that.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.744
Did you shape
this board?

34:05.777 --> 34:08.480
Unless some idiot's trying
to sell knockoff Hagens.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.616
That'd be a good way
to go broke.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.484
So, there's a number
on the stringer.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.719
Five, eight, four, three?

34:13.752 --> 34:15.421
5,834th board I shaped.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.089
I'm up over six K now.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.258
Any idea who you made it for?

34:19.291 --> 34:20.726
If it's a custom order,
I'd know for sure.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.729
I keep the dimensions
of all the boards I shape.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.664
In case someone wants you
to replicate their magic board?

34:25.697 --> 34:27.833
Surfing G-man.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.601
So, why does the FBI want

34:29.635 --> 34:31.770
to know
who I shaped a board for?

34:31.803 --> 34:33.205
It's part of a crime scene.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.206
Plus, I figured while

34:34.240 --> 34:36.442
I was down here,
I'd put in an order for a fish.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.344
Maybe a six-oh, six-one.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.478
Yeah, good choice.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.380
Fish are my
specialty.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.714
Yeah, I know.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.616
All right, here we go.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.685
Yeah, 5843. Okay.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.787
Yeah, I remember this guy.
Cameron Wilson.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.790
Made him a
seven-foot pintail.

34:51.823 --> 34:52.724
Park Service ranger?

34:52.758 --> 34:54.760
That's him. Yeah,
said he needed a board

34:54.793 --> 34:56.495
that could handle
some juice.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.729
You know him?

35:06.438 --> 35:07.639
I checked with
the Park Service.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.841
They said
Wilson's gone AWOL.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.211
Hey, I need to point
something out to you guys.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.879
Yeah? What's that?

35:13.912 --> 35:17.149
All right... this is Wilma's
the day that Nathan died.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.684
Yeah, but Nathan
never made it out there.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.520
Right, so I expanded
this animation to include

35:21.553 --> 35:23.222
more of that island
during the swell.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.457
This spot right here

35:25.491 --> 35:27.893
experienced bigger waves
than Wilma's that day.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.428
Nathan had another spot
besides Wilma's.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.429
Right.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.297
I mean, look, you'd have

35:31.330 --> 35:32.264
- to go by here.
- DAVID: Right, okay.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.200
We know that Drummond was out
by that way.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.202
So, maybe Nathan runs
to Drummond.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.936
Drummond hits him in the head,
knocks him out,

35:37.969 --> 35:39.671
drops him in the ocean to drown.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.907
Wilson keeps a sailboat
in Ventura.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.909
Harbor Master checked.
Gone.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.444
Now, he's probably
halfway to Fiji by now.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.412
DON:
I don't know. Look.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.579
I mean, as far as he knows,

35:47.613 --> 35:48.747
we didn't find the farm.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.349
DAVID:
He's in the wind.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.583
He knows we're monitoring
his credit cards.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.620
What, you think he goes back
for the dope, tries to turn it

35:54.653 --> 35:55.821
into cash?

35:55.854 --> 35:58.224
Well, the forecast calls for
another big swell tomorrow.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.425
So, that's the perfect time
for someone familiar

35:59.458 --> 36:01.193
with that spot
to go grab the hidden stash.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.861
DON: I mean, he's spent his
whole life out on these waters.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.463
NIKKI: He'll know where to land.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.897
Somewhere sheltered
from the waves.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.499
CHARLIE: Yeah, you know, and
this wave animation

36:07.533 --> 36:08.800
does more
than show us previous swells.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.502
It shows us what incoming swells
are gonna do.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.204
It's like, for
instance, let's say,

36:12.238 --> 36:13.672
there's a big storm
below New Zealand.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.674
Okay, and it's
headed the right way.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.276
Southern California's
almost guaranteed

36:17.309 --> 36:19.445
to have a major swell
about a week later.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.546
As long as you know
where the wind's blowing,

36:20.579 --> 36:22.448
for how long,
and in what direction--

36:22.481 --> 36:24.550
and that's all readily
available data from satellites--

36:24.583 --> 36:25.884
you should be
able to predict

36:25.917 --> 36:28.254
whether the surf's gonna
to be big or small.

36:28.287 --> 36:31.557
And this is the only place
on that side of the island

36:31.590 --> 36:33.259
that's gonna be protected
from the surf tomorrow.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.294
It's the perfect place
to go ashore.

36:48.607 --> 36:52.210
(engine revving)

37:10.762 --> 37:11.997
Stop!

37:13.299 --> 37:14.500
Cut the engine.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.695
I'm thinking "circumstantial"
probably isn't the right word.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.498
And I'm thinking you didn't need
to blow me off my Ski

37:46.532 --> 37:47.699
with a bean bag round.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.301
We've got your fingerprints
all over the

37:49.335 --> 37:50.369
marijuana operation,
and we have

37:50.402 --> 37:51.437
the bullet that
killed Drummond.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.604
Now how much
you want to bet

37:52.638 --> 37:54.373
it matches one
of the guns on your boat?

37:54.406 --> 37:55.841
Then what do you want
from me then?

37:55.874 --> 37:57.075
Nothing, really.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.077
Now, see, we know
why you killed Drummond,

37:59.110 --> 38:01.713
and we got a pretty good idea
why Drummond killed Nathan.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.520
Maybe I can give you something.

38:08.554 --> 38:09.821
Yeah?

38:09.855 --> 38:10.922
What?

38:10.956 --> 38:12.624
Drummond didn't kill Nate.

38:12.658 --> 38:15.561
Are you confessing to
killing a federal officer?

38:15.594 --> 38:17.629
No. Not me.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.398
Drummond had a partner
out there.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.834
Didn't you guys know that?

38:23.969 --> 38:25.937
Yeah.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.906
Yeah, I think we did.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.978
Nice. Good job.
That was great.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.646
DON:
Melissa?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.648
Sorry. One second.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.617
Can we can make this quick?

38:38.650 --> 38:41.052
I don't know,
Colby, can we?

38:41.086 --> 38:43.589
So, we executed a search warrant
on your apartment.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.357
Forensics found blood specks
on your shoes.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.758
And we're pretty sure
we know whose it is.

38:46.792 --> 38:47.893
Nathan found out

38:47.926 --> 38:49.561
you and Drummond were ripping
off Wilson, is that it?

38:49.595 --> 38:53.465
Now's the time to make
it easier on yourself.

38:53.499 --> 38:56.001
Pat tried to talk him
into a three-way split.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.469
I knew Nathan wouldn't bite.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.438
So, instead,
he arrested you.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.440
Just like that.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.608
Didn't matter how close

39:02.641 --> 39:04.676
we'd been, how much
we'd shared.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.545
He knew how things
were for me.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.514
All the stuff I was doing
to try to get by.

39:08.547 --> 39:09.948
I'm just trying to make

39:09.981 --> 39:11.617
a little cash
without hurting anyone.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.519
Pat saved his life once.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.421
I was his damn girlfriend.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.055
Tell us what happened.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.457
Nathan had his gun on Drummond.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.792
He turned his back to me
to grab the kayak.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.160
Like I didn't matter.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.563
Like I was zero threat.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.965
I mean, the-the paddle
was in my hand.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.600
What did he think
I was gonna do?

39:28.634 --> 39:30.802
Just go off to prison quietly?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.438
(handcuffs rattling)

39:32.471 --> 39:34.406
Next thing I know,

39:34.440 --> 39:37.409
Nathan's facedown in the water.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.545
And Drummond--

39:39.578 --> 39:42.414
he's freaking
like a little bitch.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.849
(handcuffs clicking)

39:53.992 --> 39:56.828
A real good thing you did
for Nathan, huh?

39:56.862 --> 39:59.965
For Keith.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.435
You know, when he quit
baseball for surfing...

40:03.469 --> 40:06.572
I told him he was
making a mistake.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.109
Turns out to be the thing
he loved most.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.446
I got that wrong, huh?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.582
Telling you, Larry,
I got another board in my car

40:16.615 --> 40:17.949
if you want to
give it a shot.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.452
LARRY: Nope. Today I choose to
experience the raw

40:20.486 --> 40:24.790
power of waves,
free of all accoutrements.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.792
Uh, is he about to get naked?

40:28.560 --> 40:29.327
(laughing)

40:29.360 --> 40:31.229
You know,
Timothy Leary said that

40:31.262 --> 40:33.899
surfers represent the pinnacle
of human evolution.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.133
Only a surfer

40:35.166 --> 40:36.802
truly lives in the moment,

40:36.835 --> 40:40.238
riding that ever-moving wave
between past and future.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.574
Dancing with the Universe.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.975
LARRY: Yeah.
Hey, who said that?

40:44.009 --> 40:45.143
Was that Feynman
or Penrose?

40:45.176 --> 40:47.245
I think it was Bodhi.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.480
Bodhisattva.

40:48.514 --> 40:49.815
Patrick Swayze.

40:49.848 --> 40:50.982
Point Break?

40:51.016 --> 40:52.851
The movie?

40:52.884 --> 40:54.786
Colby, what are
you doing? Come on!

40:54.820 --> 40:55.821
CHARLIE:
All right, dudes.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.255
We gonna surf or not?

40:57.288 --> 40:58.189
Show us how it's done, Colb.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.968
INTERVIEWER:
Your worst wipeout.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.537
NATHAN:
That's Jaws.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.838
INTERVIEWER:
I've seen the film.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.773
Seen the footage of that.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.775
NATHAN: Couple years ago, I got
spanked.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.945
I mean, the thing wouldn't
let me up for a long time.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.513
And I'm almost at the surface,

41:21.547 --> 41:24.182
and boom, the second one
just shoves me even deeper.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.884
INTERVIEWER: So, wait, wait--
two-wave hold-down?

41:27.152 --> 41:28.554
Wow!

41:28.587 --> 41:30.088
The second one
won't let me up, either.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.592
And now, I'm... I'm thinking,
you better get up there soon,

41:33.625 --> 41:35.727
'cause the third one...

41:35.761 --> 41:38.163
I mean, I never met anybody
who's lived through three.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.632
So now I'm starting to thrash.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.935
I mean, what
you don't want to do--

41:43.969 --> 41:45.704
panic.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.307
And, uh...

41:49.340 --> 41:51.276
And then I hear my dad's voice,

41:51.309 --> 41:54.279
like, right here, like...

41:54.312 --> 41:55.981
I mean,
like I'm wearing headphones.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.118
"Relax, son.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.954
"Every wave lets you up
eventually.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.992
Only way
to get through it is relax."

42:07.025 --> 42:11.229
Once he said that to me in Baja.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.901
So I relaxed,

42:15.934 --> 42:18.069
it let me up,

42:18.103 --> 42:19.971
I got a breath.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.876
Saved my life.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.277
INTERVIEWER:
Your dad saved your life?

42:27.946 --> 42:29.681
Yup. My dad.
