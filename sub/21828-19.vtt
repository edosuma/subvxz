00:03.000 --> 00:05.125
(Ryan)
Previously on Mech-X4.. .

00:05.208 --> 00:06.667
(Randall)
He's allergic to technology.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.333
There are 30 more
just like him,

00:08.417 --> 00:10.333
and if you can't cure them,
they'll die.

00:10.417 --> 00:12.417
(Mark) You could've gotten
Harris hurt or worse!

00:12.500 --> 00:13.583
Are you gonna take that chance?

00:13.667 --> 00:15.458
-Even if it meant saving the world?
-No!

00:15.542 --> 00:18.750
Traegar has given me more power
than you can imagine.

00:18.834 --> 00:21.500
The red bloom, they're spreading them
over the whole city.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.041
(Ryan)
Spyder, bounce belt! Now!

00:25.458 --> 00:27.083
(Traegar) I have enough red bloom
to infect

00:27.166 --> 00:30.375
and control every human
on the planet.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.917
(car alarms wailing)

00:38.000 --> 00:40.166
This is bad.
Very bad!

00:40.250 --> 00:42.208
(distorted)
You belong to Traegar, Ryan.

00:42.291 --> 00:43.375
Do something.
Do something!

00:47.166 --> 00:48.458
-Get 'em!
-Come on!

00:48.542 --> 00:50.458
(shouting)

00:50.542 --> 00:52.458
(theme music playing)

01:26.291 --> 01:27.959
Okay, I barricaded
the entrance,

01:28.041 --> 01:29.542
and I technopathically
locked all the doors.

01:29.625 --> 01:30.792
Any luck warning our parents?

01:30.875 --> 01:32.125
I can't reach either of my dads.

01:32.208 --> 01:34.375
I don't even have a signal!

01:34.458 --> 01:36.625
But I may not
have paid my bill.

01:36.709 --> 01:37.792
(phone rings)

01:39.542 --> 01:40.458
Mom, are you okay?

01:40.542 --> 01:42.875
I'm surrounded by people saying,
"Get Mech-X4!"

01:42.959 --> 01:43.959
And "Where is your son?"

01:44.041 --> 01:46.166
So, no, I am not okay!

01:46.250 --> 01:48.875
-Where are you? Where is Mark?
-It's a long story.

01:48.959 --> 01:51.417
I'll tell you when we get to the robot
and get you out of there.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.458
I-I'm trapped at the corner
of 2nd and Lex. Hurry!

01:58.208 --> 02:00.291
Do these things
still have invisibility?

02:00.375 --> 02:01.291
Yeah. Ready?

02:04.417 --> 02:05.500
(indistinct shouting)

02:05.583 --> 02:07.333
(confused murmuring)

02:07.417 --> 02:09.000
Aw, man!

02:09.083 --> 02:10.500
I lost 'em!

02:10.583 --> 02:12.208
I never do anything right!

02:12.291 --> 02:14.041
(shouting)

02:17.125 --> 02:19.083
-Georgia!
-Hey, Miss Walker.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.792
(distorted)
Ready to serve Traegar?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.333
Don't make this tougher
than it has to be.

02:23.417 --> 02:24.792
No reason this
needs to be tougher

02:24.875 --> 02:26.208
than your flank steak.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.000
That better be
the mind control talking,

02:28.083 --> 02:29.417
young lady,
or you and I,

02:29.500 --> 02:30.750
we're gonna have
a problem!

02:30.834 --> 02:33.208
-(red bloom hisses)
-(yelps)

02:33.291 --> 02:34.417
(crowd shouting)

02:49.375 --> 02:52.291
You will all serve Traegar!

02:54.625 --> 02:56.208
(car revs)

03:04.625 --> 03:06.000
Mark, your girlfriend...

03:06.083 --> 03:08.375
Is being controlled?
Yeah, I got that.

03:08.458 --> 03:11.417
We'll save her when we
save everyone else... I hope.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
(sighs) Ryan's headed to the ferry
to get Mech-X4.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.333
We should meet him there.

03:15.417 --> 03:16.667
Right.

03:16.750 --> 03:17.917
Can't wait to see him.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.125
What?

03:19.208 --> 03:20.542
Nothing.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.917
So... anything you want
to tell me about my flank steak?

03:26.166 --> 03:27.208
Uh...

03:29.583 --> 03:31.333
(roaring)

03:39.375 --> 03:41.291
(groans)

03:41.625 --> 03:43.250
(distorted)
Get to the ferry by the junkyard.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.250
That's where the robot is!
Go, go!

03:48.500 --> 03:50.500
-(helicopter whirring)
-(indistinct shouting)

04:06.208 --> 04:09.000
Man, it looks like
he's infected all of Bay City.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.542
Oh, is pointing out the obvious
another one of your powers?

04:11.625 --> 04:15.333
-Seriously?
-Sorry. Uh, I snark when I'm scared.

04:15.375 --> 04:17.542
Looks like they've got those
new acid-tipped missiles.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.375
That's... that's awesome.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.000
I... I mean, bad. Really bad.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.458
Dead, just like my cell phone.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.208
I'm seeing a pattern here,
and I do not like it.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.834
Repairs, half done.

04:36.917 --> 04:39.458
X-Weapon,
yeah, still toast.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.375
And most of our systems...

04:41.458 --> 04:42.917
(sighs)
Offline.

04:43.709 --> 04:46.375
(Ryan) We don't have a choice.
We gotta get outta here.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.875
(whooshing)

05:00.000 --> 05:01.500
Mark and your mom are here!

05:01.583 --> 05:03.291
The car can survive
a missile strike, right?

05:03.375 --> 05:05.834
-No!
-Then we have a problem.

05:09.375 --> 05:12.208
I can't...
activate the shields!

05:12.291 --> 05:14.333
I can stop the missiles.
V, the landing bay.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.500
Yeah, working on it!

05:18.959 --> 05:20.083
(grunts)

05:22.917 --> 05:24.083
(grunts)

05:27.542 --> 05:29.333
Come on, Mark.
Come on.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.000
(grunts)

05:36.500 --> 05:38.583
(explosion)

05:38.667 --> 05:41.166
(panting)

05:47.083 --> 05:48.083
(Ryan)
Mark!

05:50.959 --> 05:52.458
Where's Mom?

05:52.542 --> 05:54.208
She's safe...

05:54.291 --> 05:56.417
down in the X-deck.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.125
I'm glad you're,
uh, you're okay.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.500
Yeah, uh...

06:03.625 --> 06:05.041
-You, too.
-(klaxon blaring)

06:05.125 --> 06:06.333
Hey, awkward brothers!

06:06.417 --> 06:07.583
They're not out of missiles!

06:07.667 --> 06:08.959
(alarm blaring)

06:14.417 --> 06:16.166
I can't stop them all!

06:19.542 --> 06:20.667
We have to
get out of here.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.417
Everybody, hang on!

06:23.417 --> 06:26.250
The repair cycle didn't finish,
so this may be a bumpy ride.

06:33.208 --> 06:34.458
(explosion)

06:48.333 --> 06:49.750
They destroyed the ferry.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.375
I can't believe it.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.542
It's gone.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.125
(Veracity)
Dude. Dude!

06:55.208 --> 06:57.875
They're repositioning for another attack.
We can't stay here!

06:58.000 --> 07:00.333
The whole city's after us.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.041
What do we do?
Where do we go?

07:02.125 --> 07:04.875
The one place I know
we'll be safe.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.834
So, from
a destroyed ferry

07:15.917 --> 07:18.875
to a creepy farm
in the middle of nowhere.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.417
Worst road trip ever,
am I right?

07:22.542 --> 07:23.750
Ah, right!

07:23.834 --> 07:25.750
Still ticked
about the whole,

07:25.834 --> 07:27.625
"You're off the team,"
thing.

07:29.625 --> 07:30.583
So...

07:30.667 --> 07:32.417
how do you know
we're safe here?

07:34.208 --> 07:35.625
Because of this ore.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.834
It blocks
electronic signals.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.792
It protects the people
that live here,

07:40.875 --> 07:42.834
and it prevents the farm
from being detected

07:42.917 --> 07:44.625
by satellites
or radar.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.709
No one can
find us here.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.458
Oh, but just in case,

07:48.542 --> 07:50.458
uh, Veracity's staying
in the control center

07:50.542 --> 07:51.375
to keep an eye on things.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.000
-Done.
-(beeping)

07:53.083 --> 07:55.583
Bloomed. Infected.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.750
Oh, yep. I need a break.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.834
Hello, epic halfpipe fails.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.375
(Veracity laughs)

08:06.709 --> 08:07.542
Oh, man.

08:09.542 --> 08:10.709
Wait, is that Ryan?

08:13.125 --> 08:16.417
Okay, everybody. Tech stays in the well
away from the Thirty.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.583
I will miss you,
connection to the outside world.

08:27.917 --> 08:30.542
So... wanna meet
my birth mother?

08:39.041 --> 08:40.542
(both talking
simultaneously)

08:42.000 --> 08:43.083
(both laugh softly)

08:45.500 --> 08:48.291
I can't believe
I'm finally meeting you.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.208
Giving up Ryan was the
hardest thing I had to do.

08:53.250 --> 08:55.834
But knowing he ended up
with a loving mother...

08:56.792 --> 08:57.834
(sighs)

08:57.917 --> 08:59.458
It's a relief.

08:59.542 --> 09:02.041
I feel like saying thanks
isn't nearly enough.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.750
They probably don't make greeting cards
for this sort of thing.

09:06.959 --> 09:10.417
But sheltering us from
mind-controlled bad guys

09:10.500 --> 09:12.750
-is a pretty good start.
-(chuckles)

09:13.959 --> 09:16.500
I know we're kind of at the end
of the world here,

09:16.583 --> 09:18.208
but, um...

09:18.291 --> 09:20.250
would you like to see
some baby pictures?

09:20.333 --> 09:21.667
Yes!

09:24.417 --> 09:27.709
Is that Ryan in a
little pink tiger suit?

09:27.792 --> 09:29.709
Yeah. He loved that thing!

09:30.750 --> 09:32.709
No, seriously, he...
he wouldn't take it off.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.125
(Violet laughs)

09:38.083 --> 09:39.125
Ryan?

09:40.333 --> 09:41.333
Traegar's winning.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.333
He bloomed Georgia,
and I had to leave her behind.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.250
Do you know how that felt?

09:45.333 --> 09:47.208
Yeah, I do.

09:47.291 --> 09:51.750
We can't just hide on this farm
while everyone we care about is infected.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.166
What should we do?!

09:53.250 --> 09:54.834
We lost the X-Weapon.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.959
We don't know how to save Harris
or anybody else.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.125
So we just sit here while
the world is falling apart?

09:59.208 --> 10:00.750
No! I'm gonna do
something useful.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.000
I can cure the Thirty.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.542
(coughing)

10:03.625 --> 10:04.709
But that'll hurt you!

10:04.792 --> 10:06.542
So did losing Harris!

10:06.625 --> 10:08.250
-Thanks for that.
-(Mark scoffs)

10:09.041 --> 10:11.667
You know what, let me know
when you decide to cowboy up

10:11.750 --> 10:13.083
and do something about Traegar.

10:29.750 --> 10:30.667
What are you guys doing?

10:30.750 --> 10:31.709
Mending socks.

10:31.792 --> 10:32.959
It's fun!

10:33.041 --> 10:34.875
You guys think that's fun?

10:35.834 --> 10:37.834
No, no, no!
Cartoons are fun,

10:37.917 --> 10:39.750
and video games,
and arcades are fun!

10:42.125 --> 10:44.041
You guys have done
that stuff, right?

10:44.125 --> 10:45.166
(Both)
No.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.750
We're cured, but some
people are still sick.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.583
So there's no
technology allowed.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.667
So you guys have...

10:52.750 --> 10:54.458
never been off
this farm, like, ever?

10:54.542 --> 10:57.000
No, but sometimes,
we make scarves.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.542
No! No, no, no, no.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.375
If the world's gonna end,

11:01.458 --> 11:03.500
these guys deserve
to have fun for once

11:03.583 --> 11:05.125
in their butter-churning lives.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.875
Why am I talking to myself?

11:08.959 --> 11:10.417
Guys! Let's go have
some real fun.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.583
Come on!

11:14.750 --> 11:17.125
Are you sure
this is safe for Ryan?

11:17.208 --> 11:19.542
(sighs) He was okay
after he cured me.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.250
He just needs
to rest after.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.625
Mom, I'll be fine.

11:22.709 --> 11:24.166
Promise.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.500
(gasps)

11:39.583 --> 11:42.000
(groaning)

11:45.917 --> 11:46.834
(static crackles)

11:46.917 --> 11:48.083
Huh?

11:50.875 --> 11:52.208
(energy crackles)

11:52.291 --> 11:53.709
(Ryan moaning)

11:54.750 --> 11:55.875
(yelps)

12:02.208 --> 12:03.625
I think that was
some kinda...

12:03.709 --> 12:04.834
technopathic spike.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.000
(beeping)

12:06.083 --> 12:07.125
A big one.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.500
But I can work with this.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.750
I can work with this!

12:14.875 --> 12:17.792
Welcome to
Hocus Pocus Pizza!

12:17.875 --> 12:20.917
Where pizza is served by
a creepy-looking rabbit.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.792
Was dragging us
behind a hoverboard

12:22.875 --> 12:25.000
really the safest way
for us to get here?

12:25.083 --> 12:26.542
-Did you wear your helmet?
-Yes.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.458
Maybe! Hey, yo!
Let's see some magic!

12:29.542 --> 12:31.083
I'm trying to show
these kids a good time!

12:31.166 --> 12:33.458
It's 20 minutes before closing, kid.
I'm supposed to be done.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.542
And I'm supposed to be
a sophomore by now.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.125
Life is full of disappointments.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.792
And the teeny-weeny top hat.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.125
-Ooh!
-(giggles)

12:48.208 --> 12:49.583
It is teeny-weeny.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.291
(unenthusiastically)
Yeah, yeah.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.458
Excuse me while I make
your pizza magically appear.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.625
(rumbling)

12:55.709 --> 12:56.834
(electricity crackles)

12:58.041 --> 12:59.458
(glasses rattling)

13:00.375 --> 13:01.875
(indistinct chatter)

13:01.959 --> 13:03.208
Where's he going?

13:03.291 --> 13:05.875
Um, I will find out.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.750
You kids go play
in the birthday room!

13:07.834 --> 13:09.625
But it's not my birthday.

13:09.709 --> 13:11.959
They don't know that! Go!

13:15.875 --> 13:17.542
-(roaring)
-(people screaming)

13:19.125 --> 13:20.625
The bloom?

13:20.709 --> 13:22.125
All the way out here?

13:23.500 --> 13:24.625
(roars)

13:26.792 --> 13:28.792
(screaming continues)

13:28.875 --> 13:29.750
What is that?

13:29.834 --> 13:31.333
Dude, no! It's not safe!

13:31.417 --> 13:32.542
Put your head back on!

13:33.875 --> 13:34.917
(roars)

13:37.417 --> 13:38.834
(people screaming)

13:45.542 --> 13:46.959
Yo, V?

13:47.041 --> 13:48.166
Bit of an emergency.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.083
Spyder, I have told you before,

13:50.166 --> 13:52.959
a booger stuck in your nose
is not an emergency.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.667
I snuck some kids off the farm
to go to Hocus Pocus Pizza,

13:55.750 --> 13:57.959
so they could finally have some fun
for once in their lives.

13:58.041 --> 14:00.375
Aw, that was sweet.

14:00.458 --> 14:03.917
But the city just got bloomed, and now,
there's a guy in a bunny suit after us.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.583
Aw. That was stupid.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.834
I brought these kids
out into this world.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.333
I spent all my money on them,

14:11.417 --> 14:13.750
and now I'm putting their happiness
before my own.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.959
Oh, no.
I'm a parent.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.000
Here you go!

14:23.083 --> 14:24.375
-Thanks, Spyder!
-Thanks!

14:24.458 --> 14:25.792
Have fun...

14:26.417 --> 14:28.291
-while you still can.
-(pounding)

14:31.417 --> 14:33.709
So, Spyder took the kids
to Hocus Pocus Pizza?

14:33.792 --> 14:35.291
-It was really sweet.
-And really stupid!

14:35.375 --> 14:36.959
-Exactly what I said.
-Okay!

14:37.041 --> 14:38.208
Let's get
to the robot and...

14:38.291 --> 14:39.834
I sort of, maybe,

14:39.917 --> 14:41.000
dismantled the control pad.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.041
-What?
-Look, I needed to understand

14:43.125 --> 14:46.250
the... the technology that connects
your power to the robot.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.667
-Because when you cured that guy...
-Okay! No time.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.291
-Okay.
-Try to put it back together fast.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.542
I'll get my hoverboard and...

14:52.291 --> 14:54.750
Spyder used it
to bring the kids there.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.792
Great.
How am I supposed to get there?

15:00.041 --> 15:01.583
More bad news for you!

15:05.208 --> 15:06.875
(light piano music playing)

15:10.750 --> 15:13.000
Uh, why are we listening to this?

15:13.083 --> 15:15.208
Because this is my car,
and you hate it.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.959
Don't.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.542
You know, you and me
going to save Spyder

15:26.625 --> 15:28.166
doesn't change
anything between us.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.750
Yeah. I got it.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.917
(distorted)
Get him!

15:42.000 --> 15:43.375
For Traegar!

15:43.458 --> 15:45.959
And for making me
wear that stupid hat!

15:47.417 --> 15:48.458
(Spyder grunting)

15:50.083 --> 15:51.500
Thank you, Boston Axe!

15:53.917 --> 15:55.291
(Brandi)
Don't you wanna play, Spyder?

15:55.375 --> 15:58.166
No, that's okay! I'm just out here
doing boring adult stuff.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.375
You guys have fun!

16:00.792 --> 16:02.333
You're not getting
to those kids!

16:03.875 --> 16:05.041

16:13.875 --> 16:15.583
I'm not gonna let these goons
hurt my friend.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.000
He's my friend!

16:17.083 --> 16:18.500
Hey! Guys!
You're both pretty!

16:18.583 --> 16:19.875
How 'bout a little help?

16:20.166 --> 16:23.458
Ryan, remember when those zombies had us
cornered in that metal shop?

16:23.542 --> 16:24.792
Yeah! I'm on it!

16:26.750 --> 16:29.000
-Prepare to serve Traegar.
-(red bloom hissing)

16:35.375 --> 16:37.000
That's for giving
me nightmares

16:37.083 --> 16:38.667

16:47.667 --> 16:48.959
-You picked up some skills.
-Yeah.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.583
Don't tell my
guidance counselor.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.125
He'll expect me
to apply myself.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.250

17:14.875 --> 17:15.917
-We're not a team.
-Nope.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
All right. That's it!

17:18.083 --> 17:20.000
How dumb are you two?

17:20.083 --> 17:22.041
Me and those kids
would've been torn apart

17:22.125 --> 17:23.291
if it weren't for both of you!

17:23.375 --> 17:25.333
-Dude!
-No.

17:25.417 --> 17:27.166
No, don't "dude" me.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.041
Mark made a hard choice
to get answers.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.458
You have a hard choice
about Harris!

17:30.542 --> 17:32.625
I made a tough decision
to protect those kids!

17:32.709 --> 17:33.959
After you put them at risk.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.500
Not the point.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.667
You're both right,
and you're both wrong.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.083
The world needs you on
the same team, so figure it out!

17:47.917 --> 17:49.625
Spyder called us dumb.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.166
He may be right.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.500
Yeah, look, Mark.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.083
I know we work
well together,

17:57.166 --> 17:58.500
but when I think
about what you did,

17:58.583 --> 17:59.625
I just get so angry.

17:59.709 --> 18:01.041
And that's how I felt

18:01.125 --> 18:02.875
when you wouldn't
listen to me about Harris.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.166
So, how do we
get past this?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.917
Okay.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.542
If I can admit

18:08.625 --> 18:10.083
that I was wrong
to hide my plan from you,

18:10.166 --> 18:12.291
can you admit that,
maybe you've made

18:12.375 --> 18:13.834
some not-so-great calls?

18:14.917 --> 18:16.125
Yeah.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.917
I kicked you off the team

18:18.000 --> 18:19.625
because I was mad,

18:19.709 --> 18:21.083
not because it was
the right thing to do.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.500
And I'm sorry.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.291
Me, too.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.417

Come on! Let's go!

18:28.542 --> 18:29.792

18:29.875 --> 18:31.417
I like being
the responsible one.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.625
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.333
Wow.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.875
You guys enjoy
being off the farm?

18:43.959 --> 18:46.083
-Best day ever!
-Can we do it again?

18:46.166 --> 18:47.542
-Next apocalypse.
-No, no, no.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.458
Spyder! (laughs)

18:51.208 --> 18:52.208
You're okay!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.041
I owe that farmer
five bucks.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.125
-What's that now?
-Nothing!

18:56.208 --> 18:57.291
So, the robot?

18:57.375 --> 18:58.458
Fully repaired,

18:58.542 --> 19:00.000
and I think I may
have found something

19:00.083 --> 19:01.083
to help us
win the fight.

19:01.166 --> 19:05.125
This is why I needed a look
inside the control pad.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.208
What is it?

19:06.291 --> 19:08.000
The key to
defeating Traegar.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.291
This is how
we take back the world.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.125
Now, I know it's no
adorable little pink tiger suit.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.667
Has everyone
seen those pictures?!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.083
But it can convert

19:23.166 --> 19:24.709
the technopathic energy
that you absorb

19:24.792 --> 19:27.041
into a charge that your body
can store for later.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.875
So, it turns you
into a giant battery.

19:29.959 --> 19:32.208
This will let me cure
all of 'em at the same time?

19:32.291 --> 19:34.000
And super-charge me
to fight Traegar?

19:34.083 --> 19:36.291
-That's the plan. Ha!
-And what if it doesn't?

19:36.375 --> 19:37.709
He'll be burnt to a crisp...

19:39.250 --> 19:42.542

should not have said to his mother.
