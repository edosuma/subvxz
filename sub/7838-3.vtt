00:25.694 --> 00:26.967
Check it out, girls.

00:27.168 --> 00:30.426
68 squares of ankle-busting fury.

00:30.748 --> 00:31.924
That's right,

00:32.167 --> 00:35.539
A double-dogleg, hamstring
knotting Hop-Way to Hell.

00:35.904 --> 00:39.040
What insane kangaroo dreamed
this fevered nightmare?

00:40.217 --> 00:41.745
Behold.

00:44.199 --> 00:46.390
Ladies, grab your pebbles.

00:49.877 --> 00:51.383
- What?
- Nothing.

00:54.856 --> 00:58.667
Lisa has a big butt.

00:58.753 --> 01:00.201
Shut up! I do not!

01:00.421 --> 01:02.659
Oh no. Don't make Lisa mad.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.781
She might crush us all
with her giant butt.

01:05.788 --> 01:09.305
Shut up, you. Stop teasing
the big-bottomed lass.

01:09.782 --> 01:11.393
She's just as God made her...

01:11.708 --> 01:14.210
Plump as a Christmas goose.

01:14.345 --> 01:17.344
Dad... the kids at school
said my butt's big.

01:17.371 --> 01:18.501
That's ridiculous, honey.

01:18.698 --> 01:21.243
You're the cutest
little girl I know.

01:21.244 --> 01:23.438
You just have
what is known as...

01:23.632 --> 01:24.966
The Simpson butt.

01:26.082 --> 01:27.115
Permit me to elaborate.

01:27.396 --> 01:29.466
Every Simpson
starts with a circle.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.578
Daddy has one
big circle here....

01:32.039 --> 01:34.072
...then a smaller one up here...

01:34.428 --> 01:37.656
two big, sexy circles for eyes...

01:38.143 --> 01:39.897
one macho muzzle...

01:40.351 --> 01:42.031
then a snappy new outfit.

01:42.078 --> 01:43.694
Ooh, I'm looking good.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.220
Ooh, cuffs. Yeah.

01:47.192 --> 01:51.445
And for some reason, my hair
and ear form an "M" and a "G.

01:53.507 --> 01:54.933
Party! Party!
Party! Party!

01:56.653 --> 01:57.981
You want to know
a little trick?

01:58.253 --> 02:00.194
To downsize my derriere,

02:00.388 --> 02:02.331
I just tie a sweater around it.

02:03.484 --> 02:04.272
See?

02:05.801 --> 02:09.407
Oh, Homer, you're wasting
away to nothing.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.678
You simply must eat something.

02:11.917 --> 02:13.641
Well, you're the boss.

02:16.141 --> 02:18.736
Oh, I love to see my man eat.

02:20.701 --> 02:21.538
Check it out, Homes.

02:21.677 --> 02:24.017
You said if I ever got
a hundred on a test,

02:24.147 --> 02:25.490
You'd throw me a party.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.715
There's my hundred...
where's my party?

02:30.511 --> 02:31.977
Nice try, loser.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.946
I bet you made up a fake test.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.366
Nope, it's real...

02:35.513 --> 02:36.876
- Check out the watermark.
- All right.

02:38.752 --> 02:41.135
SEUL VOUS POUVEZ
PREVENIR LES FRAUDES

02:43.543 --> 02:44.782
Here's a mistake.

02:44.974 --> 02:48.191
It says the capital
of Kentucky... is Frankfort.

02:49.446 --> 02:50.670
Dream on, pal.

02:50.832 --> 02:53.248
Homer, the capital of
Kentucky is Frankfort.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.119
Really?
Frankfurter...

02:56.345 --> 02:57.234
is that anything?

02:58.294 --> 03:00.217
Yes, it's something, dear.

03:00.218 --> 03:01.331
See, it's all legit.

03:01.394 --> 03:02.590
Now make with the party.

03:02.591 --> 03:04.559
All right, boy, which con
did you work here?

03:04.560 --> 03:05.714
Copy off another kid?

03:05.849 --> 03:06.946
Pay attention and take notes?

03:08.469 --> 03:10.612
Well, take note of this.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.072
Bart really did
get a hundred.

03:18.142 --> 03:19.894
I gave a test on state capitals,

03:19.895 --> 03:21.423
but I forgot to roll up the map.

03:22.666 --> 03:23.853
Everyone got a hundred.

03:23.897 --> 03:25.729
I win. P-A-R-T.

03:25.733 --> 03:27.136
Par-tee.

03:29.603 --> 03:31.876
People, please.
It's a school night.

03:31.918 --> 03:33.011
I thought
you two broke up.

03:33.658 --> 03:34.576
This means nothing.

03:34.711 --> 03:36.951
Yes, yes, you've
made that quite clear.

03:37.312 --> 03:40.312
Maybe a different outfit would
make me look thinner.

03:51.358 --> 03:54.843
This store makes me feel
even worse about myself.

04:06.634 --> 04:09.043
I heard she's back
to her birth weight.

04:09.278 --> 04:10.763
Must be nice.

04:13.075 --> 04:15.685
No, no, the body on this
mannequin is all wrong.

04:15.998 --> 04:19.745
I know. It's such an unrealistic
standard for young...

04:20.898 --> 04:24.238
Planing down the thighs,

04:24.262 --> 04:27.588
I make four bucks an hour
planing down the thighs.

04:31.255 --> 04:32.529
I don't look so bad.

04:34.551 --> 04:38.943
Don't worry, Lisa. You can still
find someone to love you.

04:39.210 --> 04:41.720
Now you've got no choice.

04:41.807 --> 04:43.480
Non !

04:44.298 --> 04:46.569
Oh boy,
Barty's gonna party.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.664
He sure is...

04:47.665 --> 04:50.569
if he can keep up with
these party animals.

04:50.947 --> 04:55.045
Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma,
Grandma Bouvier and...

04:56.787 --> 04:58.149
Grampa.

05:00.673 --> 05:02.112
Plus  your school-yard chums:

05:02.366 --> 05:03.648
Martin and Ralph.

05:04.057 --> 05:06.045
Bart's my bestest
boyfriend.

05:06.891 --> 05:09.189
Oh Mom, this
guest list sucks.

05:09.511 --> 05:11.841
It's the best I could do
on such short notice.

05:12.718 --> 05:14.165
Where's Milhouse?

05:14.404 --> 05:15.552
He's got the measles.

05:15.754 --> 05:17.878
But we've got him on
speakerphone.

05:18.168 --> 05:19.150
Rock on.

05:19.151 --> 05:24.550
You know, the first time I met
Bart was at recess in first grade...

05:25.154 --> 05:27.322
Oh, I told him
to use a land line.

05:28.548 --> 05:31.392
Okay, gang, let's get
this party started.

05:31.601 --> 05:33.729
or should I say Barted?

05:37.968 --> 05:39.166
For our first game,

05:39.166 --> 05:43.165
I need everyone to draw a
picture of President Eisenhower.

05:45.391 --> 05:47.947
I drew him with Canadian Prime
Minister Louis St. Laurent.

05:48.152 --> 05:50.622
Their relationship was
frosty at best.

05:54.376 --> 05:58.207
Duck, duck, duck, duck,
duck, duck, duck,...

06:05.211 --> 06:06.584
Say "goose," you stupid freak.

06:20.570 --> 06:23.197
Oh, Mom, this was
the worst party ever.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.510
Gee, I did
the best I could...

06:28.089 --> 06:29.581
Here's Lisa.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.121
She'll save the party.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.139
Honey, sit down.
Have a big slice of cake.

06:34.403 --> 06:36.660
What? I'm not
fat enough already?

06:36.817 --> 06:38.728
How could you say that to me?

06:40.692 --> 06:41.967
Lisa,  wait...

06:51.069 --> 06:53.086
Hello? Hello?

06:53.242 --> 06:56.221
I had to leave 'cause my
French bread pizza dinged.

06:56.966 --> 06:57.642
Hello?

06:58.143 --> 07:01.900
Duck, duck, duck, duck,
duck, duck, duck,...

07:12.701 --> 07:14.968
What's the big deal...
Bart didn't like his presents.

07:15.146 --> 07:17.814
So what? It's not like he
gives us such great gifts.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.484
Remember that maple leaf ironed
between the sheets of wax paper?

07:21.615 --> 07:22.738
What was that?

07:22.976 --> 07:23.932
That was crap.

07:24.206 --> 07:26.233
Oh, it's not just the presents.

07:26.369 --> 07:28.602
The kids don't appreciate me anymore.

07:28.808 --> 07:31.371
They'd rather hang out with
their friends than with their mom.

07:31.537 --> 07:33.242
So they're growing up.

07:33.367 --> 07:36.097
Soon they'll be leaving the nest,
and you'll have time for yourself.

07:36.825 --> 07:39.132
hundreds of thousands of hours,

07:39.486 --> 07:42.801
And then, the peace of the grave.

07:43.263 --> 07:43.894
No!

07:44.067 --> 07:46.850
No, I've got a lot more
mothering left in me.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.869
I'll be right here at
3:00 to pick you up.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.271
Then I'll take
you to the zoo.

07:51.455 --> 07:54.371
We can eat fries
out of a safari hat!

07:54.589 --> 07:58.322
No, thanks. I'm going to stay in
the library and do a little reading.

08:01.075 --> 08:02.717
Well, I guess it's
just you and me, Bart!

08:02.727 --> 08:05.222
Mom, after that
lame party you threw,

08:05.441 --> 08:07.379
I'd rather hang out
with thunder-thighs here.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.321
They grow up so fast.

08:12.288 --> 08:14.365
They're just asserting
their independence.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.790
If a child doesn't do it now,
it may never happen.

08:16.938 --> 08:19.404
Seymour! Do you want your
vitamin in applesauce?

08:19.405 --> 08:21.147
Or are you gonna take it
like a big boy?

08:21.783 --> 08:22.870
Applesauce.

08:27.152 --> 08:28.842
Oh, sure, you love
me now,

08:29.006 --> 08:30.652
but you'll turn.

08:32.691 --> 08:35.419
Stop struggling  and
get in my mouth, jerks!

08:36.251 --> 08:38.611
Aren't you the boy
who beats up my son?

08:38.850 --> 08:40.421
Prob'ly.
What's your name?

08:40.602 --> 08:41.315
Simpson.

08:41.469 --> 08:42.716
Oh, yeah. Bart Simpson.

08:42.886 --> 08:44.121
Spiky hair, soft kidneys,
always hitting himself?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.356
Those tadpoles
are your lunch?

08:51.543 --> 08:53.059
Technically, brunch.

08:53.419 --> 08:54.974
Well, here, take this.

08:55.272 --> 08:57.605
My daughter didn't want
the lunch I made.

09:07.488 --> 09:08.999
This sandwich rocks.

09:09.176 --> 09:11.763
My tadpoles seem crude
by comparison.

09:20.891 --> 09:22.297
You're nocturnal.

09:22.457 --> 09:25.239
You don't have to impress me
by making fun of others.

09:25.483 --> 09:26.752
I already like you.

09:28.326 --> 09:30.746
I'm starting to let
down my guard.

09:36.004 --> 09:36.771
Thanks, Mrs. S.

09:37.432 --> 09:39.308
Today didn't
totally suck nard.

09:39.497 --> 09:41.602
It's nice to be
appreciated.

09:43.037 --> 09:43.998
Whatever.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.299
Take it sleazy.

09:51.367 --> 09:52.136
Mom?!

09:53.749 --> 09:57.175
Nelson? I thought you were
sleeping in the park tonight.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.838
Oh, that's okay, the kid
don't bother me none.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.088
Hey, Nelson, say hello to Moe.

10:02.305 --> 10:04.451
He said he'd take
you camping sometime.

10:04.885 --> 10:06.194
I said I might.

10:08.288 --> 10:08.632
Hey, kids,

10:08.925 --> 10:11.860
I just heard they canceled league
night down at the bowling alley.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.247
You know what that means?

10:13.421 --> 10:15.203
Open lanes!

10:18.947 --> 10:19.601
Whaddya say?

10:19.913 --> 10:21.435
It'll be BLAM!

10:21.447 --> 10:23.850
Bart, Lisa and...

10:24.230 --> 10:24.717
Mom.

10:25.738 --> 10:28.768
Mom, when I want lame
and needy, I'll call Milhouse.

10:28.785 --> 10:29.477
No offense.

10:29.856 --> 10:30.498
Fine!

10:30.675 --> 10:32.420
I'll take my mothering elsewhere.

10:38.414 --> 10:40.482
Ooh, great roll, Nelson.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.504
Here, I cut up your
hot dog for you.

10:46.555 --> 10:48.049
Wow, hot dogs are awesome!

10:48.257 --> 10:50.113
You've never had one before?

10:50.292 --> 10:52.334
No, but I saw some
in a catalog once.

10:52.450 --> 10:55.022
People in sweaters were
eating them at a picnic.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.579
So, my mom works at Hooters,

11:06.706 --> 11:10.388
but  her dream is to go to Vegas
and work in a real strip club.

11:12.531 --> 11:15.057
And, uh, where's
your dad in all this?

11:15.253 --> 11:17.787
He  went out for a pack of
cigarettes and never came back.

11:17.989 --> 11:19.423
He said "smell ya later,"

11:19.557 --> 11:22.344
but he never smelled me again.

11:24.490 --> 11:27.777
Nelson, how'd you like to earn some
extra money around our house?

11:28.043 --> 11:30.453
I have some odd jobs
my kids won't do.

11:30.684 --> 11:32.179
Yeah.

11:32.317 --> 11:36.762
I get the feeling Bart isn't everything
he could be in the son department.

11:37.765 --> 11:42.450
Sometimes I think he's more interested in
his "Itchy and Mitchy" cartoons than me.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.975
I'm sure it's just a phase,

11:45.149 --> 11:48.755
like when I used to stand on the overpass
and drop computers on the freeway.

11:49.845 --> 11:51.545
That's how we get our Kaypro.

11:52.408 --> 11:54.942
64, 65, 66...

11:54.753 --> 11:55.692
Hey, Lisa.

11:55.847 --> 11:59.191
Are you counting how many days
it takes to wash your big butt?

12:01.452 --> 12:02.967
I  can't hear you.

12:03.129 --> 12:05.719
That's because your butt blocks your ears.

12:05.723 --> 12:07.131
That doesn't make any sense.

12:07.273 --> 12:08.872
Neither does your butt.

12:12.634 --> 12:15.343
I know this obsession
with thinness is unhealthy..

12:15.379 --> 12:16.851
and anti-feminist...

12:16.992 --> 12:19.631
but that's what a
fat girl would say.

12:19.885 --> 12:21.104
Lis, look!

12:29.605 --> 12:33.308
Now, I know there's a handsome
young man behind all that hair and dirt.

12:37.628 --> 12:38.484
Maybe not,

12:38.932 --> 12:41.030
but you did a great
job on the lawn.

12:41.243 --> 12:42.433
Thanks, Dingus...

12:42.683 --> 12:44.117
I mean, ma'am.

12:45.493 --> 12:46.304
My mother...

12:46.459 --> 12:47.075
my bully...

12:47.226 --> 12:48.479
my God!

12:49.333 --> 12:51.770
Lisa, just take a bite.

12:51.963 --> 12:54.182
One bite...
That's all I ask!

13:01.851 --> 13:03.691
Now, I can't have
toothpaste tonight.

13:08.916 --> 13:10.838
Here's the money
you gave my son.

13:11.897 --> 13:13.390
We don't want
your charity.

13:14.114 --> 13:15.668
I didn't give
your son charity.

13:15.805 --> 13:17.618
I gave him self-respect.

13:18.687 --> 13:20.314
Self-respect, huh?

13:20.456 --> 13:23.424
No wonder he came home with
his vest all buttoned...

13:23.612 --> 13:25.044
like he was somebody.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.304
Go home to your son,
Mrs. Muntz,

13:29.652 --> 13:32.502
and try not to have
intercourse on the way!

13:49.993 --> 13:52.893
Nelson, what are you
doing out this late?

13:53.180 --> 13:54.261
My mom ditched me!

13:54.402 --> 13:56.974
She went to Hollywood
to be an actress,

13:57.148 --> 13:59.639
but her range is limited!

14:02.878 --> 14:04.477
She's still your mother.

14:04.689 --> 14:05.773
Come inside.

14:10.013 --> 14:11.782
Can I get you
a glass of milk?

14:12.062 --> 14:13.872
Cow milk?!

14:22.392 --> 14:24.258
What are you doing
in my jammies?

14:24.565 --> 14:26.804
I'm your new roommate.
I call top bunk.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.282
But...
it's a single bed.

14:29.486 --> 14:31.746
I said top bunk!

14:40.600 --> 14:41.019
Mom,

14:41.051 --> 14:42.722
the reason God
invented dead bolts...

14:42.787 --> 14:45.699
is to keep people like
Nelson out of your house.

14:46.036 --> 14:48.754
Bart, have you ever eaten
a Tootsie Pop?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.766
You know, there's
a tough, crunchy shell,

14:51.905 --> 14:56.310
but if you lick it, there's
a delicious sweetness inside.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.569
Be nice to Nelson, and I'll
give you a Tootsie Pop.

15:02.893 --> 15:03.914
Morning, losers.

15:04.102 --> 15:05.048
Mrs. Simpson.

15:05.877 --> 15:07.730
Pancakes,
my favorite!

15:09.962 --> 15:12.189
Bart, eat up or you'll
be late for school.

15:12.349 --> 15:13.428
I'm not hungry.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.512
You heard the lady,
clean your plate!

15:18.315 --> 15:19.446
Savor it.

15:19.590 --> 15:21.926
Let the flavors dance
on your palate.

15:31.106 --> 15:32.277
Next on ABC,

15:32.284 --> 15:34.452
Who's dropping by
to see George Lopez ?

15:34.570 --> 15:36.133
We pray it's you!

15:36.808 --> 15:37.800
Open.

15:39.236 --> 15:40.900
Nelson, doesn't that
hurt your teeth?

15:41.620 --> 15:42.782
My teeth hurt all the time.

15:42.967 --> 15:44.991
I just try to think
about motorcycles.

15:45.722 --> 15:47.024
I don't like
the sound of that.

15:47.245 --> 15:49.650
Tomorrow I'm taking you
to Dr. Shapiro.

15:49.786 --> 15:51.637
A doctor for your teeth?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.064
What's next, a lawyer
for your hair?

16:01.982 --> 16:05.323
Papa, can you hear me?

16:06.471 --> 16:09.176
Papa, can you see me?

16:10.410 --> 16:17.543
Papa, can you find me
in the night?

16:18.360 --> 16:20.204
Papa, are you near me?

16:20.560 --> 16:22.575
Papa, can you hear me?

16:22.777 --> 16:29.255
Papa, can you help me
not be frightened?

16:30.016 --> 16:33.946
Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes...

16:33.964 --> 16:38.245
Which ones are yours?

16:39.463 --> 16:41.218
I gotta do something
about him.

16:48.451 --> 16:50.033
This is the perfect test.

16:50.203 --> 16:54.106
If I can have one dab
of frosting and then stop,

16:54.266 --> 16:56.400
I'll know I've conquered
food at last.

17:04.935 --> 17:05.816
That was too easy.

17:16.531 --> 17:19.839
If I stop here,
I still have some dignity.

17:23.957 --> 17:26.404
Well, at least she's
not singing Streisand.

17:33.023 --> 17:35.564
Hey Lis, still insecure
about your body?

17:36.513 --> 17:37.985
Yeah, a little.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.089
Those mean girls
just get to me.

17:41.389 --> 17:42.790
I understand.

17:42.863 --> 17:45.292
I have a sister...
I think she's dead now

17:45.413 --> 17:47.065
who had the same problem.

17:47.204 --> 17:49.057
And I know just the solution.

17:54.967 --> 17:55.769
Sherri. Terri.

17:55.923 --> 17:58.294
The only thing sweeter
than you two...

17:58.411 --> 18:00.220
are these stolen cookies.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.610
Enjoy.

18:02.634 --> 18:04.537
Thank you, Nelson.

18:08.049 --> 18:09.873
Sherri smells,
Terri smells

18:10.086 --> 18:11.618
Stinky all the way

18:12.081 --> 18:14.065
Stink-stink stink,
stink-stink stink

18:14.318 --> 18:16.058
One-horse open sleigh

18:20.099 --> 18:21.071
Thank you, Nelson.

18:21.255 --> 18:24.632
He who haw haws last,
haw haws best.

18:25.655 --> 18:28.792
I really appreciate  you teaching
those mean girls a lesson.

18:28.961 --> 18:31.711
Tomorrow I can bleach a
swear word into their hair.

18:31.856 --> 18:32.924
I'd like that.

18:36.809 --> 18:37.532
Nelson?

18:38.269 --> 18:39.087
Papa!

18:39.824 --> 18:41.021
You came back!

18:43.932 --> 18:45.644
I never meant
to leave you, Nelson.

18:45.855 --> 18:48.424
But something awful happened
when I went to the store.

18:48.665 --> 18:50.427
Well, that explains a lot.
Who's hungry?

18:50.578 --> 18:52.649
No. I want to hear what
happened at the store.

18:53.119 --> 18:55.139
Well, I went in
to buy cigarettes...

18:56.667 --> 18:58.262
Could you gift-wrap them, please?
They're for my son.

18:58.384 --> 19:00.170
I also bought myself
a candy bar,

19:00.357 --> 19:04.341
which, uh, unfortunately  was filled
with peanuts,  to which I am allergic.

19:10.252 --> 19:14.345
I ran outside  just as the
circus was  rolling into town.

19:26.161 --> 19:28.065
And that's where I found him.

19:29.110 --> 19:31.637
I brought him back here
so he could take Nelson away,

19:31.818 --> 19:33.178
and my bruises would heal.

19:34.437 --> 19:37.143
I want to give you
a home again, son.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.491
And so do I.
- Mom!

19:39.568 --> 19:41.427
I got an acting job.

19:41.623 --> 19:43.854
From the third director
I slept with.

19:44.581 --> 19:46.612
I play Lady MacBeth.

19:47.472 --> 19:49.134
I don't have
to take my top off,

19:49.348 --> 19:50.472
but I do anyway.

19:51.081 --> 19:54.529
Well, I'm glad everything
worked out so well.

19:54.753 --> 19:57.470
The Muntzes are back
in business.

19:57.584 --> 20:00.510
Yep, the Four Muntzes.

20:03.586 --> 20:05.246
Thanks for finding
my Dad, Bart.

20:05.406 --> 20:08.469
And thanks, lady, for making
me feel good about myself.

20:09.350 --> 20:11.367
So, now that you're happy again,

20:11.523 --> 20:14.119
I guess you won't beat me up
at school anymore.

20:14.337 --> 20:15.971
I wish it were that simple.

20:16.702 --> 20:17.977
I really do.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.896
They're a family again.

20:24.088 --> 20:26.001
And so are we.

20:26.170 --> 20:27.322
What happened?

20:28.345 --> 20:31.077
Sometimes you have to
adopt your son's bully

20:31.212 --> 20:35.396
in order to bring your own
family temporarily closer.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.042
And Lisa, what
have you learned?

20:38.238 --> 20:38.738
Nothing.

20:38.950 --> 20:42.306
Like many women, I still have an
unhealthy obsession with my weight.

20:42.478 --> 20:46.583
But talking about the problem is the
first step towards the solution, right?

20:46.615 --> 20:47.410
I guess.

20:47.564 --> 20:49.686
But there's
a long way to go.

20:51.012 --> 20:53.715
Come on, say
something conclusive.

20:53.896 --> 20:56.521
I'm afraid this is a very
open-ended problem.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.932
Oh, open-ended?!

20:59.747 --> 21:01.815
Oh, come on, Lisa.
Say everything's fine.

21:02.006 --> 21:03.843
Everything's fine.

21:04.038 --> 21:05.014
That was you.

21:05.193 --> 21:05.769
Prove it.
