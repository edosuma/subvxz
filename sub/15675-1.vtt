WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:04.205
"They All Laughed"
playing

00:17.718 --> 00:21.522
* They all laughed
at Christopher Columbus *

00:21.555 --> 00:25.626
* When he said the world
was round, aha *

00:25.659 --> 00:30.664
* They all laughed
when Edison recorded sound... *

00:32.600 --> 00:34.435
Ahem. Ooh.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.172
* They all laughed
at Wilbur and his brother *

00:38.206 --> 00:42.410
* When they said
that man could fly *

00:42.443 --> 00:46.280
* They told Marconi
wireless was a phony... *

00:46.314 --> 00:49.617
Is he doing
Frank Sinatra?

00:49.650 --> 00:51.352
He can do Frank Zappa
for all I care.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.188
As long as it
holds him off.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.424
All right,
let's cycle her
through again.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.859
- Donna: Her?
- Yeah, her.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.129
Temperamental,
high-maintenance,

01:01.162 --> 01:02.796
only responds
to the right touch.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.399
Yeah, well, I've been
touching this thing
for six months

01:05.433 --> 01:07.501
and he still
hasn't turned on.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.272
* They all laughed
at Rockefeller Center *

01:11.305 --> 01:15.643
* Now they're
fightin' to get in *

01:15.676 --> 01:20.114
* They all laughed at Mutiny
and our cotton gin... *

01:20.148 --> 01:24.152
( cheering )

01:24.185 --> 01:28.389
* They all said
we never would be happy *

01:28.422 --> 01:31.792
* They laughed at us,
and how *

01:31.825 --> 01:34.228
* But, oh, ho-ho

01:34.262 --> 01:37.865
* Who's got
the last laugh now? *

01:37.898 --> 01:40.368
Hey, could you make them
hurry up downstairs?

01:40.401 --> 01:43.904
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- We're gonna lose this dude.

01:43.937 --> 01:48.242
Hey, it's nice to see
some ladies here for once.
( chuckles )

01:48.276 --> 01:50.511
Probably should've waited
to schedule the celebration

01:50.544 --> 01:51.612
of a working mainframe

01:51.645 --> 01:56.550
until the mainframe was
actually, you know, working.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.752
Hey, Bos says hurry up.
That reporter's gonna leave.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.388
Donna:
Yeah.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.691
All right, try that.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.728
( sighs )
Still not booting up.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.731
( inhales )

02:13.801 --> 02:15.203
You okay?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.572
Yeah.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.274
Scale of one to 10?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.744
I'm fine.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.945
Do you want to lie down?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.347
Yeah, of course
I want to lie down.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.516
I've been awake
for 20 hours.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.883
I just...

02:29.917 --> 02:32.453
Scale of one to 10?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.888
Two.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.524
Three, max.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.629
Mm, let me check
the power unit again.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.400
And now, please,
without further ado,

02:46.434 --> 02:49.370
let's welcome
our founder,
Cameron Howe.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.872
- Come on.
- ( crowd cheering )

02:51.905 --> 02:54.174
Come on.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.211
Hey.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.912
( cheering continues )

02:58.946 --> 03:03.751
* They laughed at me
wanting you *

03:03.784 --> 03:05.453
* Said it would be...

03:05.486 --> 03:06.987
- Hi.
- Man: Hey.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.523
- Cameron Howe.
- Ross Weaver, "InfoWorld."

03:09.557 --> 03:13.894
- Mm.
- Quite a party, but, um,
maybe a little premature.

03:13.927 --> 03:14.962
( chuckles )

03:14.995 --> 03:17.831
Seriously,
how much longer?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.600
Um...

03:19.633 --> 03:23.637
Oh, God, somebody
put a cigarette out
on this wire wrap.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.975
You know, once we're
our own network,

03:28.008 --> 03:30.511
Cameron and I can get back
to what really matters.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.981
I'm sure she's eager
to get you back.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.916
( sighs )
Booting up?

03:35.949 --> 03:39.653
- ( loud pop )
- ( mainframes whirring )

03:39.687 --> 03:41.322
It's on!

03:41.355 --> 03:42.623
It's on!

03:42.656 --> 03:44.758
( cheering )

03:44.792 --> 03:47.561
( muffled cheering )

03:47.595 --> 03:48.862
Oh!

03:48.896 --> 03:50.264
( cheering continues )

03:50.298 --> 03:53.401
The Death Star is online
and operational.

03:53.434 --> 03:57.037
( gasps )
Alderaan will never
know what hit it.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.007
Hey, Donna.
Cam wants you upstairs
like right now.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.911
Yes.
Let's go celebrate.

04:03.944 --> 04:08.449
* Because, ho-ho-ho,
who's got the last laugh? *

04:08.482 --> 04:12.453
* Hee-hee-hee,
let's make the past laugh *

04:12.486 --> 04:18.559
All:
* Har-har-har, who's got
the last laugh now? *

04:18.592 --> 04:20.928
All right!
Suck it, Telenet,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.964
you faxed us
your last invoice!

04:23.997 --> 04:26.734
Bosworth:
Whoa, ho!
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

04:26.767 --> 04:29.470
- ( popping )
- ( crowd gasping )

04:33.374 --> 04:35.576
That is way more fireworks
than we talked about.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.814
( cheering )

04:40.848 --> 04:44.017
( chanting )
Speech! Speech!

04:44.051 --> 04:45.653
Bosworth:
Hey, come on.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.055
( chanting continues )

04:48.088 --> 04:50.924
- ( cheering )
- Donna: Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.394
Okay, first of all,
I would like to welcome

04:53.427 --> 04:55.996
our guest, Ross Weaver,
from "InfoWorld."

04:56.029 --> 04:57.798
I hope you've all had
a chance to talk to him.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.600
He'll be covering
our relaunch.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.802
- Hide the drugs.
- ( laughing )

05:01.835 --> 05:06.674
As you know,
we hit 100,000 users
last week.

05:06.707 --> 05:07.775
Yeah!

05:07.808 --> 05:09.677
But,
more importantly,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.011
it's a banner day,
you guys.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.080
Our Independence Day!

05:13.113 --> 05:15.883
( cheering )

05:15.916 --> 05:17.785
Cameron:
Oh, oh, one more thing.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.052
This is very important.

05:19.086 --> 05:23.123
John Bosworth
is officially
a grandfather.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.793
( crowd cheering )

05:25.826 --> 05:28.962
Look, I know it feels
like we got to California
two minutes ago,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.831
but we can't slow down now.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.901
We are continuing
to expand user experience
on the network...

05:33.934 --> 05:36.870
Avatar modification,
building out neighborhoods.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.939
We have a ton
of really important
deadlines coming up

05:38.972 --> 05:41.041
and we are counting
on you guys.

05:41.074 --> 05:45.746
We know how hard it was
to leave all our friends
and family in Texas,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.515
but we are so impressed
with your commitment

05:47.548 --> 05:49.149
- and we just want--
- Speaking of commitment,

05:49.182 --> 05:51.719
there is one person
I would especially
like to thank--

05:51.752 --> 05:53.454
my husband Gordon Clark.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.523
- ( applause )
- Donna: Come on up.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.658
Crowd:
Gordo!

05:57.691 --> 05:59.660
I just want to say
thank you so much

05:59.693 --> 06:01.795
for believing
in this crazy idea

06:01.829 --> 06:03.864
and slaving away
in the basement with me,

06:03.897 --> 06:06.166
because we couldn't have
done it without you.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.468
I couldn't have.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.704
Crowd:
Whoo!

06:10.738 --> 06:13.707
Cameron:
All right, come on,
let's get back to the party.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.643
"Shut Us Down" playing

06:15.676 --> 06:17.545
( crowd applauding )

06:26.787 --> 06:29.022
- ( sighs )
- * I got a 'lectric guitar

06:29.056 --> 06:32.526
* And half a bottle
of warm beer *

06:34.695 --> 06:38.966
* I got some funny ideas
about what sounds good... *

06:38.999 --> 06:41.502
( imitating Donna )
I couldn't have done it
without you, Gordon.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.004
Yeah, couldn't have done it
without your money.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.773
( chuckles )

06:45.806 --> 06:47.908
* Butter shut us down

06:50.010 --> 06:52.179
* Better shut us down.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.186
( theme music playing )

07:29.850 --> 07:31.485
Unbelievable.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.953
This is
a complete hatchet job.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.588
Gordon:
I know it hurts,
but, trust me,

07:34.622 --> 07:36.757
there's no such thing
as bad press.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.258
And the Pro got creamed
in the trades

07:38.291 --> 07:40.728
and it still
outsold the Giant
by a factor of five.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.763
No, this is different.
This is bad.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.598
What, let me guess.
You're gonna kill him?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.900
No, it's his facts
that are killing us.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.169
We're a quarter
of the size of CompuServe,

07:49.202 --> 07:51.238
we have less infrastructure
than The Source,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.607
nowhere near the investment
visibility of Q-Link.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.243
I hate it,
but he's right.

07:56.276 --> 07:59.012
- What's up, squirt?
- "Family Circus" still sucks.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.581
- That's true.
- Hey, language.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.982
Language.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.251
- Where is Joanie?
- Getting dressed.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.120
He calls you upstarts,
says you're a welcome addition

08:07.154 --> 08:08.889
of heart and vitality
to the Valley landscape.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
The guy's--
that's great.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.126
Yeah, he's also got us
going under by '88.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.862
Well, if you're that
worried about it,

08:14.895 --> 08:16.864
issue a press release
full of stats and revenue

08:16.897 --> 08:19.299
and, you know, tell your
version of the story.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.734
What? No one reads
press releases.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.169
They read magazines,
like this one.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.738
Well, then,
we might as well
write an obituary.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.010
- Oh, shit.
- Haley and Gordon: Language.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.812
Sorry, honey.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.214
I've got to meet
with Joanie's principal
today at 4:00.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.683
Why?

08:35.716 --> 08:37.084
She got in a fight
on Monday.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.754
Okay, when were you
gonna tell me about that?

08:40.788 --> 08:43.090
I'm sorry.
Completely forgot.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.625
She win, at least?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.560
The school wants
a parent meeting.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.795
Uh, we have a development
meeting at 4:00.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.230
- I know.
- So, can't he do it?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.967
Okay, I'll give
you guys a minute.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.641
( keyboard clacking )

09:00.674 --> 09:01.709
Roar!

09:01.742 --> 09:03.744
Roar!
Got you.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.345
You totally didn't know
I was in there.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.780
Yeah, well,
you're totally busted

09:06.814 --> 09:08.682
for the fight
you got into at school.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.684
Whatever.
I kicked her ass.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.054
- Really?
- Go ahead.
You know you want to.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.589
What?

09:15.623 --> 09:18.191
( imitates modem
screeching )

09:18.225 --> 09:21.695
You're such
a little brat.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.131
- And I--
- ( modem screeching )

09:24.164 --> 09:26.934
I know you're frustrated.
I'm frustrated, too.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.937
We're five people living
on top of each other,
and that's--

09:29.970 --> 09:33.641
Donna, I'm frustrated
because this was supposed
to be temporary.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.676
- It is temporary.
- No, it's been six mo--

09:35.709 --> 09:37.945
- ( rumbling )
- Oh, shit.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.748
Haley, sweetheart,
get under the table.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.915
- ( screams )
- Joanie!

09:41.949 --> 09:44.117
- Mom!
- It's okay, it's okay.

09:44.151 --> 09:48.321
- ( rattling )
- It's all right.
You okay?

09:48.355 --> 09:51.191
- Was that...?
- Yes, it was. Hang on,
there's broken glass here.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.627
What should we do?
Should we stay in the doorway
or go outside?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.696
You're fine.
You're fine right
where you are.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.397
Joanie, baby,
are you okay?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.733
I'm fine, just don't
freak out on me.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.101
Sorry, do you think
that was just a preview?

10:01.134 --> 10:03.036
- Like a bigger one's coming?
- ( whimpers )

10:03.070 --> 10:04.938
- Or is that
the final thing?
- Hey, listen.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.740
- You're not helping.
- Don't be such a wimp, Haley.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.909
- Hey, Joanie.
- Your sister's scared.
Be nice.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.744
- You always
take her side.
- Joanie.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.012
Hey, listen, guys.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.881
( all gasp )

10:13.914 --> 10:17.050
Jesus, people,
it's toast.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.390
Donna:
My, don't you look
out of this world.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.958
Cameron:
Pretty rad, right?

10:24.992 --> 10:26.426
The antennae just
rolled out this week,

10:26.459 --> 10:27.761
along with sunglasses,
regular glasses,

10:27.795 --> 10:29.196
and a mohawk
customization.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.664
You should totally
get the mohawk.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.299
Oh, we should
totally get going.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.902
Let's start with Main Street
and then the smaller places.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.770
( gasps )
Oh, there's Sledgehammer.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.373
Did you hear CompuServe's
expanding to Japan?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.776
And GEnie added
10,000 users last quarter.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.845
At least CBS might
back out of Trintex.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.014
Great, then it's just
IBM and Sears.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.751
Seams kind of dead
on here, doesn't it?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.753
Well, yeah,
at 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday

10:52.786 --> 10:54.421
and the system's
like a casino floor
in the morning.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.856
It's only the hardcores.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.959
But, hey, look
at Comic Book Corner.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.427
Donna:
Oh, the niche room
metrics

11:00.460 --> 11:02.262
are off the charts
'round the clock.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.964
That place is rowdy, man.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.133
There's more fights
than a Hells Angels bar.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.202
Well, I guess it's good
that these guys' glasses
are digital, then.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.039
Nice.
Oh, hold on a sec.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.281
Guy's got
a 1311 with a modded
thumbfire button.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.316
Jeez, do you know
everybody on here?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.218
( computer beeping )

11:25.252 --> 11:27.187
( keyboard clacks )

11:29.923 --> 11:31.358
( groans )

11:31.391 --> 11:32.893
And then here we are.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.494
64,000 pixels

11:34.527 --> 11:36.964
of prime, undeveloped
real estate.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.267
It can be whatever
we want it to be.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.803
It's got to be--

11:44.171 --> 11:46.139
it's gotta be
something great.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.976
( knocks )

11:49.009 --> 11:51.845
Ryan.
What's up?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.213
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.882
Are we still on?
I know we said 9:00.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.050
- Maybe it was 9:15.
- No, it was 9:00.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.152
Yeah, no, 9:00.
Come on in.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.090
( mouths )
I don't know.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.524
( computers whirring )

12:04.557 --> 12:06.426
( muffled footsteps
thudding )

12:10.530 --> 12:13.867
( thudding continues )

12:26.980 --> 12:30.818
( muffled laughing,
chattering )

12:32.519 --> 12:34.955
( muffled music playing )

12:34.988 --> 12:37.124
( footsteps continue
thudding )

12:44.231 --> 12:45.398
Okay, here's another way
to look at it.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.836
Community looks like this.

12:48.869 --> 12:53.106
No, uh, it looks like this.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.208
Well, no, like this.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.378
Just-- okay, blah, blah,
chatting, chatting, chatting.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.347
We dress it up with
a sprite-scaling interface,

13:00.380 --> 13:02.215
but underneath
it's just paint-by-numbers.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.884
You know, here's a room,
chat in it.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.385
I think it's a little more
than paint-by-numbers.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.254
To discount the meaningful
human interaction.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.856
No, no, no, it works,
it's fine.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.391
It's like vanilla ice cream,
but it's...

13:11.424 --> 13:15.228
So, here are the users
and here's private chat.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.463
And the users,
they're talking, talking.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.831
"Hey, what's going on?

13:17.865 --> 13:19.232
Let's get to know
each other more."

13:19.266 --> 13:20.567
So they go to private chat.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.536
And then private chat
is just PETSCII because--

13:23.570 --> 13:25.338
1977.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.841
You know how your mom
always says to close
the door behind you?

13:27.875 --> 13:30.077
These two users,
they-- they leave,

13:30.110 --> 13:31.611
and they
don't close the...

13:31.644 --> 13:35.048
Okay, so,
all these other people
here are saying,

13:35.082 --> 13:36.449
"Hey, what
are you guys doing?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.318
Where are they going?
I want to check that out."

13:38.351 --> 13:40.620
And so they--
they go, like that.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.189
And so...

13:42.222 --> 13:43.456
that's your problem.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.128
Have you guys ever seen
"The Conversation"?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.496
Which conversation?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.465
Wait, the--
the Gene Hackman movie?

13:52.499 --> 13:53.500
Exactly.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.301
Uh...

13:54.334 --> 13:56.503
People think
private chat is private.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.305
But because of the way
somebody wrote it--

13:58.338 --> 14:00.607
- The way I wrote it.
- Donna: Wait, wait.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.177
You're telling me
that people are hacking
private chats?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.914
Sure, um, big-time.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.415
Look.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.884
So, see this
little guy here?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.920
That's the hacker.
Totally masked.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.554
The asterisk
is a prompt for data.
You can't mask that.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.157
Hold on.
How did you get this?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.926
These are private
chat transcripts.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.094
Easy, I just walked
through the gaping holes
that the hackers did.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.462
- Ryan.
- No, you cannot do that.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.064
Sure, I can.
I just--

14:24.097 --> 14:25.498
Don't do it again.
I mean it.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.601
That's a direct violation
of our user agreement.

14:28.635 --> 14:32.472
Yeah, okay.
Um, totally right.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.374
Uh, but here's my idea.

14:34.407 --> 14:38.578
So, you connect users
outside public room,

14:38.611 --> 14:42.415
but to different
encryption points first,
then to each other.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.152
You cover tracks,

14:45.185 --> 14:48.388
you rebuild private chat

14:48.421 --> 14:50.290
separate from Mutiny,

14:50.323 --> 14:53.493
but also still
talking to Mutiny
outside Mutiny.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.395
Second
but separate Mutiny.

14:55.428 --> 14:59.466
Users here,
here, and here

14:59.499 --> 15:03.503
network, remote,
program, hub,

15:03.536 --> 15:06.940
RSA filters
one, two, three.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.512
No cache.
Voila.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.416
Ryan, that's
an entirely new

15:16.449 --> 15:19.486
and very expensive
something

15:19.519 --> 15:22.355
using techniques
that our coders
don't even know, so--

15:22.389 --> 15:24.457
I can do it.
I can do it.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.460
You still have a ton
of sprite rendering for me.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.998
Then put one of the guys
who can't do this on it.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.832
Ryan, we're not doing it.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.671
Okay.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.643
- But here's another idea.
- ( groans )

15:43.676 --> 15:45.478
Okay, you know what?

15:45.512 --> 15:49.149
Ryan, why don't you
just send it to us
electronically?

15:49.182 --> 15:51.684
Okay.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.520
Cool.
No problem.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.189
Great, really looking
forward to checking it out.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.557
Oh, and just to say it
one more time,

15:57.590 --> 15:59.659
something like this
is way better for Mutiny

15:59.692 --> 16:01.194
than putting a bow tie
on an avatar.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.396
Got it.
Yeah, thanks.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.400
( door opens )

16:07.434 --> 16:08.568
"One Way Ticket" playing

16:08.601 --> 16:10.337
* Give me a one-way ticket

16:10.370 --> 16:13.140
* Give me a one-way fare

16:13.173 --> 16:14.374
* Give me
a one-way ticket... *

16:14.407 --> 16:16.109
- It's happening again!
- ( rumbling )

16:16.143 --> 16:17.377
( laughing )

16:17.410 --> 16:19.112
It was funny
the first six times.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.214
Next person that does it
is gonna wear their
underwear as a hat.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.116
( bangs )
Cut it out,
you cretins.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.053
Every time you screw around,
it rains down debris
on the mainframe.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.321
Look.
There's a date now.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.490
Dude, that's today.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.759
If you ask me, it's got
Reagan's fingerprints
all over it.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.762
- Jesus.
- Hello, remember
lasers in space?

16:35.795 --> 16:36.963
Okay, it starts with fear

16:36.996 --> 16:40.367
because nobody wants to die
in a nuclear blast.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.336
And then, one by one,
they take away your rights

16:43.370 --> 16:45.138
until you're
Sieg Heilin' Ronnie

16:45.172 --> 16:47.107
and bowing down
before Ed Meese.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.741
Bodie:
It's gotta be
some gay thing.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.343
You know, like AIDS.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.744
Real sensitive, dude.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.780
Wonderboy:
Maybe it's
a religious thing,

16:53.813 --> 16:56.816
like Pat Robertson
saying the world's
gonna end again.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.251
Gordon:
You idiots.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.053
- It's Joe MacMillan.
- Wait, what?

17:00.087 --> 17:01.454
- No way!
- Nyet.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.556
- Oh, that's better than Reagan.
- The antivirus guy?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.625
- How are you so sure?
- They were partners.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.627
Dave:
Is it true
he knows Madonna?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.296
Like, really knows her?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.763
I heard his first client
was the CIA.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.365
Yeah, no,
that was Oracle.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.800
Didn't MacMillan, like,
steal your idea

17:13.833 --> 17:15.502
and make
a gazillion dollars?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.341
Yeah.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.211
But I'm suing the son
of a bitch, aren't I?

17:24.244 --> 17:26.846
* Give me a one-way ticket,
oh, yeah *

17:26.879 --> 17:29.316
* Get me out of here.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.151
No, I slept
right through it.

17:31.184 --> 17:34.187
( chuckled )
I woke up and some water
had sloshed out the toilet bowl,

17:34.221 --> 17:36.223
but that was about it.

17:36.256 --> 17:40.160
- But, look, Terry,
before the big one hits...
- ( knock on door )

17:40.193 --> 17:43.196
I want to get
this modem order
sorted out.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.332
You're damn right, v.22.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.767
Hey, and I want
the wholesale number
for that.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.637
Ter-- oh, come on, man.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.840
I can walk right across
the street to USR

17:53.873 --> 17:55.842
and get high-speed
transfer for that.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.644
Just--

17:57.677 --> 17:59.879
all right, well,
call me back when
you want to talk,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.149
when you've come
to your senses,
all right?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.517
Thanks.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.319
( sniffles )

18:06.353 --> 18:08.588
Look, you need to--
you need to invest

18:08.621 --> 18:11.124
in some improvements
in the mainframe room.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.792
It's a disaster
waiting to happen.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.461
All right,
whatever you need.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.595
No problem.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.331
( sighs )

18:18.365 --> 18:20.367
There something else,
Gordon?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.637
( Arki speaking Russian )

18:25.938 --> 18:28.175
How do you do it?

18:28.208 --> 18:31.578
How do you deal
with all this nonsense?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.413
Oh, well...

18:39.619 --> 18:43.523
You know, it's like
feeding animals
at the zoo.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.858
Dangle a couple kippers out
for them and they dance

18:45.892 --> 18:50.163
and keep them
locked up in their cages
the rest of the day.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.732
( no audible dialogue )

18:58.938 --> 19:03.510
You talking about
the queens of the jungle,
that's a different story.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.677
Advice?

19:04.711 --> 19:07.280
( phone ringing )

19:07.314 --> 19:10.550
I find it wise
not to interfere
with the brain trust.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.219
( ringing continues )

19:12.252 --> 19:14.587
They run the place.
I just work here.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.859
Bosworth.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.428
Joe:
Boy or girl?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.696
- Excuse me?
- Boy or girl?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.332
Your grandchild.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.801
Oh, it's, uh--
he's a boy.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.503
Who is this?

19:30.537 --> 19:33.473
Joe:
Come on, did you really
forget about me?

19:35.575 --> 19:40.347
- Joe?
- I just wanted to call
and say I'm happy for you.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.581
Hey, how did you
even get the--

19:41.614 --> 19:42.815
Be well, John.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.418
( clicks, dial tone )

19:56.429 --> 19:58.565
Yeah, 100,000 users
sounds good,

19:58.598 --> 20:00.433
but what really matters
is how long they stay on.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.801
And moving that number
is proving

20:01.834 --> 20:03.636
a lot more difficult
than it looks.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.904
Hey, listen.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.774
Once I get
the mainframe solid,

20:07.807 --> 20:11.478
I was thinking...

20:11.511 --> 20:15.515
I don't know,
I was thinking about maybe
pursuing other opportunities.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.916
Wh--

20:16.949 --> 20:18.785
We did what we set out
to do with the 3033

20:18.818 --> 20:22.955
and, come on,
there's not really
much more for me to do.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.794
Well...

20:27.827 --> 20:30.663
I want you
to be happy.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.333
Hi.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.802
I'm guessing you two
are Joanie's mom and dad.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.437
Oh, are you
Jennifer's mom?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.672
Most of the time.
People also call me Diane.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.740
Of course.
I'm Donna.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.943
Oh, Gordon, sorry.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.746
Look, as far as Joanie goes,
I know how hard it is

20:46.779 --> 20:47.947
to be the new kid in school.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.749
She has my sympathy.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.351
But I think
what this boils down to

20:51.384 --> 20:54.621
is Jennifer is
just pretty pissed
at her father and me.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.055
We're going
through proceedings.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.590
It's been a bit rocky.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.626
Pr-- proceedings?

20:59.659 --> 21:00.827
Divorce.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.595
I'm so sorry.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.365
Oh, I'm not.
Believe me, it's better
for everyone.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.934
Except Jennifer,
who's lashing out.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.069
Anyway, so, I apologize

21:10.102 --> 21:12.472
and I hope it hasn't
caused you too much grief.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.740
( soft laugh )

21:13.773 --> 21:16.743
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Clark.
Oh, Mrs. Gould.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.077
Principal Wilcox
will see you now.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.546
Great.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.489
( keyboard clacking )

21:54.514 --> 21:55.982
- Hey, Cam.
- Hi.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.452
Hey, did you tell
anyone else about
my grandson?

21:59.486 --> 22:00.587
No.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.954
Should I not
have announced it?

22:01.988 --> 22:06.025
Nah, nah.
I'm just wondering.

22:07.627 --> 22:11.063
Hey, Bos.
Come here.

22:12.164 --> 22:12.932
What?

22:12.965 --> 22:16.736
Uh, I need you
to give Ryan a raise.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.705
Just bump him up 15%.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.774
All right,
that's a good call.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.710
The kid's been doing
a bang-up job.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.479
- Yeah.
- All right.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.518
( chatter )

22:56.976 --> 22:59.846
( coders chattering )

23:01.681 --> 23:04.684
Hey, I'm working here.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.919
Dude, we're all going
to Burger King.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.821
Come to lunch with us.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.491
I brought today.
I'm good.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.461
Come on,
this Boo Radley-in-
the-basement thing

23:14.494 --> 23:15.895
is getting
kind of creepy.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.564
We're offering you
a flame-broiled way
out of here.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.566
Look, I don't have time.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.200
This is important, okay?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.202
Seriously?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.704
( scoffs )
Whatever.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.073
What a slave.
What, does he sleep late?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.463
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.865
Why?
I'm the one changing

23:52.899 --> 23:54.801
in the middle
of a little girls' room.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.804
Thank you again for being
so understanding.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.539
Kids'll be kids.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.674
Maybe Jennifer can come
play with Joanie sometime.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.176
Well, that would be odd
considering they don't
like each other.

24:04.210 --> 24:08.114
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
I'll talk to Joanie.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.551
I like it that we're
both raising girls
who are fighters.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.085
Don't you?

24:22.695 --> 24:25.164
What?

24:25.197 --> 24:28.000
I'm just glad
you didn't get suspended.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.969
( sighs )

24:31.771 --> 24:34.106
I know you think
you hate California.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.012
I know it's--
it's hard here.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.850
But...

24:45.084 --> 24:48.054
we have to commit.

24:49.756 --> 24:53.760
Otherwise, it's never
gonna feel like home.

24:53.793 --> 24:56.228
( crying )
The whole house
was shaking.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.767
Sweetie, you okay?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.301
I'm fine.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.103
- You sure?
- Fine.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.337
( sniffles )

25:09.208 --> 25:12.078
We are gonna be okay.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.546
I promise.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.757
It's a raise, son.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.192
You won today.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.995
Did Cameron or Donna
mention anything else?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.697
Is it less
than you asked for?

25:30.730 --> 25:32.865
I didn't ask
for anything.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.903
I just pitched them
some ideas.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.774
I'm sure they'll reach out
when and if the time is right.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.943
Hmm?

25:45.912 --> 25:48.247
I'm sure
they'll let you know.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.585
( door opens )

25:52.619 --> 25:54.987
( TV announcer
speaking Spanish )

26:03.663 --> 26:05.331
Blue Moon Detective?

26:05.364 --> 26:06.999
- Oh, hey, CamHowe.
- Hey.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.002
Nice to meet you...
in person.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.675
It's weird meeting people
this way, isn't it?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.844
It's like you jumped
out of my computer screen

26:17.877 --> 26:19.679
or something,
like you're not real.

26:19.712 --> 26:23.716
Yeah, yeah,
Mutiny's pretty cool
in that...

26:23.750 --> 26:28.621
I haven't been on long.
I only just discovered it.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.256
How about you?

26:30.289 --> 26:32.959
Uh, I work there,
actually.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.094
Oh, wow.
That's gotta be fun.

26:35.127 --> 26:38.230
Yeah, you know,
it's harder than it looks.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.899
Is this the gear?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.100
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Please go ahead.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.369
Um, I think
it's in there somewhere.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.137
Oh, yeah.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.078
Hope the paint's okay.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.647
Yeah, no, he was
a big Niners fan, right?

26:54.681 --> 26:56.983
Yeah, he was.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.720
Uh, how do you know
about that?

27:02.288 --> 27:03.355
What?

27:03.389 --> 27:06.793
That he was a--

27:06.826 --> 27:08.995
wait, did we talk
about him?

27:10.196 --> 27:11.931
- Yeah.
- My son.

27:11.964 --> 27:16.235
Yeah, yeah.
You posted in the grief
and support room.

27:16.268 --> 27:19.105
And I'm so sorry
for your loss,

27:19.138 --> 27:21.974
but the, um, joystick
looks great, so--

27:22.008 --> 27:23.342
We didn't meet
on the grief board.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.978
We met in the tech room.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.246
Right.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.448
That's where we met,
but I saw that you posted

27:29.481 --> 27:31.217
in the grief
and support room
and then--

27:31.250 --> 27:35.955
All I posted was--
I mean, I just posted
that I had lost someone.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.825
I never said
anything about...

27:38.858 --> 27:42.962
I just had private chats
about him with other people.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.732
- Not anything--
- No.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.467
We never talked
about him, never.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.270
How-- how the hell
do you know about that?

27:51.303 --> 27:53.039
How do you know
about him at all?

27:53.072 --> 27:55.141
I...

27:56.375 --> 27:57.443
I think I should go.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.112
How do you know
about my son?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.882
Those conversations
were supposed to be private.

28:07.219 --> 28:10.189
( whirring )

28:13.525 --> 28:16.228
( distant music, chatter )

28:24.937 --> 28:26.973
( clicking )

28:28.074 --> 28:30.777
( coders laughing )

28:40.319 --> 28:43.355
- ( popping )
- ( laughing )

28:43.389 --> 28:45.524
What, can you blame me?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.894
All this to add
graphics capability
to chat.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.296
Whatever keeps
the users on longer.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.765
Seriously doubt
it'll work long.

28:52.799 --> 28:56.102
Yeah, but this
LZW compression
is pretty cool.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.437
Lev: You really think
people are gonna stick
around because of GIFs?

28:58.470 --> 29:01.207
- It's pronounced "jif."
- No way. Hard G, "gif."

29:01.240 --> 29:03.409
I heard "jif,"
but it's cool if you
want to be wrong.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.845
Hey, look, everyone,
it's "Jordon."

29:05.878 --> 29:08.314
Hey, you guys know I can
hear everything you say

29:08.347 --> 29:09.415
down in the mainframe room?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.951
Yeah,
can you hear this?

29:11.984 --> 29:12.985
( farts )

29:13.019 --> 29:14.520
( coders laugh )

29:14.553 --> 29:17.389
Marty, I worry
about you.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.925
What I couldn't help
but overhear

29:18.958 --> 29:22.128
is you guys whining
about having a long night.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.362
Back in the Cardiff
kill room,

29:23.395 --> 29:24.797
we developed
a little technique

29:24.831 --> 29:26.799
for pushing through
nights like this.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.035
Called it
the "Tandy-Shandy."

29:29.068 --> 29:32.905
One keeps you sharp,
and the other's--

29:34.040 --> 29:35.107
the other's a beer.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.442
( laughs )

29:36.475 --> 29:39.145
Well, we've got
our own technique,

29:39.178 --> 29:41.147
if you're interested.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.015
Ooh.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.183
( pops tab )

29:44.216 --> 29:49.155
( laughing )

29:49.188 --> 29:51.257
And that, gentlemen,
is how you jerk off
a dinosaur.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.259
( laughing )

29:53.292 --> 29:55.161
( pounds table )

29:56.896 --> 29:58.564
All right, now, look,
I'm gonna make a phone call.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.867
When I come back,
I wanna hear about that Amiga.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.534
All right?

30:11.177 --> 30:13.012
( dial tone )

30:19.018 --> 30:21.120
( touch-tones beeping )

30:23.289 --> 30:24.623
( line ringing )

30:24.656 --> 30:26.392
James:
Bosworths, leave a message.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.527
- ( beeps )
- Hey there, son.
It's Dad.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.562
I suppose you're getting used
to calling yourself that

30:30.596 --> 30:32.098
right about now, huh?

30:32.131 --> 30:34.100
( chuckles )

30:34.133 --> 30:37.636
Oh, hell, I bet
it's getting late
in Rockwall.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.872
Dang it.

30:39.906 --> 30:43.109
I hope I didn't wake
my little sweet pea up there.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.880
I'm sorry
I keep missing you.

30:47.914 --> 30:51.550
I just want to hear
every little detail
about that kid.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.187
It would occur to me
I don't even know

30:55.221 --> 30:58.891
the little fella's name.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.392
Did you guys decide
on one or--

31:00.426 --> 31:02.494
( beeps )

31:15.274 --> 31:18.410
So...
( coughs )

31:18.444 --> 31:20.980
So I go over
to Joe's house,

31:21.013 --> 31:24.650
you know, I'm expecting
to see this guy swinging
from the rafters.

31:24.683 --> 31:25.617
Holy shit.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.454
But, surprise,
he's alive.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.223
He opens the door.
I mean, he looks like hell,

31:31.257 --> 31:33.025
but he's alive.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.360
So, I go in.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.296
You know, the whole place
is cleaned out.

31:37.329 --> 31:42.268
And I can see it,
his whole life gone,

31:42.301 --> 31:44.203
destroyed.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.471
It's exactly
what I had thought,

31:45.504 --> 31:47.306
which is exactly
why I stayed up all night

31:47.339 --> 31:49.008
reversing
the Sonaris code.

31:49.041 --> 31:53.379
You know, honestly,
I really wanted to help him.

31:55.047 --> 31:59.185
So I gave him the disk
out of the goodness
of my heart.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.452
We hugged.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.488
Joe MacMillan
knows how to hug?

32:02.521 --> 32:05.457
Next thing you know,
I wake up,

32:05.491 --> 32:08.394
I'm reading
about $10 million
in financing,

32:08.427 --> 32:11.063
all based
on m software.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.132
That's insane.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.434
Yeah.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.004
Of course a guy like that
would steal your idea.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.106
I mean, he's too stupid
to come up with one of his own.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.174
No, no, no, no, no.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.410
Don't you do that.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.612
Don't you
underestimate him.

32:26.645 --> 32:31.183
That's when
he's most dangerous.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.352
No, Joe's...

32:35.754 --> 32:38.624
Joe's brilliant.

32:38.657 --> 32:42.461
And when you're
in that guy's thrall,

32:42.494 --> 32:45.497
you know,
it feels like a drug.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.736
You know, you--
you feel...

32:50.769 --> 32:54.673
like the most important
person in the world.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.583
And that's when you wake up
with your neck slit,

33:04.616 --> 33:07.153
bleeding all over
the floor.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.156
( door opens )

33:15.327 --> 33:17.163
What is that?

33:17.196 --> 33:20.032
They're Ryan's
private chat transcripts.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.600
He'd already
printed them off

33:21.633 --> 33:24.636
and I figured
maybe there'd be
some answers in here,

33:24.670 --> 33:27.073
but what if we do
go under by '88?

33:27.106 --> 33:30.476
I mean, everything
we went through last year,
all the battles we fought,

33:30.509 --> 33:33.512
moving everything out here,
everyone, our--

33:33.545 --> 33:35.547
leaving our families
and our friends.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.417
What if we did all that
just to, what,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.652
putter around out here
for a couple of years

33:40.686 --> 33:44.656
and then disappear like
we were never even here
in the first place?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.593
No, moving here
wasn't a mistake.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.328
Here.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.263
There's gotta be
something in here.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.465
Well, there's all kinds
of reasons that people
are signing off.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.267
They're getting
along so well,

33:55.301 --> 33:56.635
they want to talk
on the phone.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.337
Maybe that's obvious.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.439
Sometimes they even
want to meet up in person.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.707
Or they want
to make a trade.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.246
I met up with
the joystick guy earlier.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.548
Then why did you
go to Fry's?

34:11.383 --> 34:15.254
Because when I met up
with him in person,

34:15.287 --> 34:17.823
he turned out to be
a total creep.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.331
( bottle cap clatters )

34:34.806 --> 34:37.409
Transactional interactions?

34:39.211 --> 34:41.380
Like, what if you didn't
have to sign off

34:41.413 --> 34:42.648
when you wanted
to make a trade?

34:42.681 --> 34:45.083
- You could just...
- Do it online.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.820
Okay, sure.

34:48.854 --> 34:51.757
That's just what you did,
but that's only one reason--

34:51.790 --> 34:54.493
Okay, look.
We're never gonna
stop people

34:54.526 --> 34:56.195
from talking
on the phone, right?

34:56.228 --> 34:58.697
And we don't want to
because that's...

34:58.730 --> 35:01.467
a genuine connection.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.270
But with
transactions...

35:05.671 --> 35:06.872
Here, look!

35:06.905 --> 35:08.407
This is about bootlegs.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.908
"I've got the Venice show
from last fall."

35:09.941 --> 35:11.810
"I've got the whole
summer up north."

35:13.245 --> 35:14.580
Here's another one!

35:14.613 --> 35:16.582
Here. How about
my "WrestleMania '85"

35:16.615 --> 35:19.885
for your Hagler/Hearns
"War" VHS?

35:19.918 --> 35:21.287
It's not gonna be
every time,

35:21.320 --> 35:22.521
but there could be
enough of these

35:22.554 --> 35:24.323
that it warrants
building something

35:24.356 --> 35:26.392
so that people are doing
this interaction on Mutiny.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.294
Even if people
aren't already trading,

35:28.327 --> 35:30.196
it's a brand-new type
of interaction

35:30.229 --> 35:31.930
that could draw in
more and more users.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.600
Yeah, yeah.
If it's good enough.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.336
It just has to be
good enough.

35:40.472 --> 35:44.176
Okay, that's...
( sighs )

35:44.210 --> 35:46.212
That's interesting.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.846
I've never seen that before.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.484
But is this it?

35:55.754 --> 35:58.690
( sighs )

35:58.724 --> 36:00.226
I-I don't know.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.794
I've never
seen it before, either,

36:02.828 --> 36:04.730
and I feel like
we've seen a lot.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.367
This could be
the sort of thing

36:08.400 --> 36:10.269
that would make people
really sit up

36:10.302 --> 36:12.338
and pay attention.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.477
- But is it it?
- Right?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.346
'Cause it needs
to be it,

36:20.379 --> 36:22.781
'cause we're only
gonna get one shot
at this out here.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.985
- ( door opens )
- Well...

36:27.018 --> 36:29.221
( door closes )

36:30.356 --> 36:32.458
Yo.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.326
Yo.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.662
Everything okay
with the mainframe?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.597
Yep.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.432
Took care of it.

36:42.501 --> 36:46.004
Anyways, it gave me an excuse
to hang out with the coders.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.874
- You know.
- Tandy-Shandy?

36:48.907 --> 36:52.611
Gordon:
And then some.
Oof.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.616
You guys working
on something?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.285
Mm.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.986
Oh, yeah,
we were just coming up
with some ideas--

37:01.019 --> 37:04.590
Ah, I'll leave it
to the brain trust.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.593
( growls )

37:12.464 --> 37:15.367
Okay,
that was so weird.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.577
So, what do you think?

37:28.013 --> 37:29.548
I think let's do it.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.783
Yeah, I think so, too.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.055
But if this is gonna work,

37:37.088 --> 37:39.024
we're gonna have
to trust each other.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.731
Reading private chats
is a violation of our
user agreement.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.302
Can we close the back door
of that code?

37:51.803 --> 37:52.971
Yeah, sure.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.573
No problem.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.718
You're high.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.588
Yeah, so are you.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.459
Oh, hey, hey.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.960
Hey.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.963
You smell like
Berkeley, Gordon.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.666
- I could take a shower.
- No.

38:20.699 --> 38:24.035
When's the last time
our bedroom smelled like weed?

38:24.069 --> 38:27.439
That's the great thing
about California.

38:27.473 --> 38:30.376
Our bedroom
can smell like weed
whenever we want.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.578
( laughs )

38:37.949 --> 38:41.420
( modem screeching )

38:47.559 --> 38:49.361
( electricity crackling )

38:51.663 --> 38:54.633
( chattering )

39:10.582 --> 39:14.085
- ( chatter quiets )
- Man: Shh, shh, shh.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.529
( shutter clicks )

39:29.568 --> 39:31.437
Fear--

39:31.470 --> 39:34.973
it's a natural reaction
to moving closer to the truth.

39:37.042 --> 39:41.146
You know, ever since
I started MacMillan Utility,

39:41.179 --> 39:44.450
I've been accused
of selling fear.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.589
But let me ask you...

39:50.622 --> 39:52.491
is it fear?

39:54.793 --> 39:56.695
Or is it truth?

39:56.728 --> 39:57.829
( shutter clicks )

39:57.863 --> 40:01.600
How sure is our footing?

40:01.633 --> 40:05.103
Yesterday morning,
many of us were reminded
of that question

40:05.136 --> 40:09.908
when we literally felt
the ground move beneath us.

40:09.941 --> 40:13.044
We live in a world
that is constantly shifting,

40:13.078 --> 40:16.081
sometimes
bringing us together

40:16.114 --> 40:18.984
and sometimes
pulling us apart.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.886
James:
Hey, Pop, don't worry
about calling late.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.822
We already gave up on sleep.
( chuckles )

40:23.855 --> 40:26.157
Anyway, uh, I thought
you'd like to know

40:26.191 --> 40:28.960
we are going with
Samuel John.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.799
( keyboard clacking )

40:33.832 --> 40:37.503
Joe:
Who are our friends?

40:37.536 --> 40:40.171
Who are our enemies?

40:45.076 --> 40:47.513
What's gonna happen to us?

40:57.589 --> 40:59.858
Are we safe?

40:59.891 --> 41:04.563
What I created has grown.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.999
Now, some of you...
( chuckles )

41:08.033 --> 41:11.903
...even call MacMillan Utility
the gold standard

41:11.937 --> 41:15.006
in corporate
antivirus protection.

41:17.242 --> 41:22.948
But in the meantime,
I've been asking myself,

41:22.981 --> 41:26.918
"What should the price
of security really be?

41:26.952 --> 41:30.689
How much should we pay

41:30.722 --> 41:32.958
to feel safe?"

41:42.333 --> 41:44.736
Wait, here's another one

41:44.770 --> 41:48.139
from that same
ancient tradition.

41:50.676 --> 41:54.580
The whole secret of existence
is to have no fear at all.

41:54.613 --> 41:57.616
Never fear
what will become of you.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.150
Depend on no one.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.688
Only in the moment
that you reject all help

42:02.721 --> 42:04.255
are you really free.

42:08.159 --> 42:11.663
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Only by moving past fear

42:11.697 --> 42:14.332
can we ever arrive
at the truth.

42:14.365 --> 42:19.170
And the truth is
freedom from fear
is a right,

42:19.204 --> 42:21.306
not a commodity.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.675
I know what
you're thinking.

42:23.709 --> 42:27.278
I charge
my corporate clients
millions.

42:27.312 --> 42:30.982
Well, they can afford it.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.920
But tomorrow
I'm releasing

42:34.953 --> 42:37.155
our user version,
Citadel,

42:37.188 --> 42:39.324
the version I created
for all of you.

42:39.357 --> 42:43.194
Mainframe-quality security
for your personal computer.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.796
( applause )

42:44.830 --> 42:46.998
Wait, wait.

42:47.032 --> 42:49.300
And I'm charging you...

42:49.334 --> 42:50.335
nothing.

42:50.368 --> 42:52.638
( applause, cheering )

42:52.671 --> 42:54.305
For you...

42:55.807 --> 42:57.809
it will be
absolutely free.

42:57.843 --> 42:59.577
( cheering )

43:02.347 --> 43:06.017
Mr. MacMillan,
I've got a question
from "InfoWorld."

43:21.933 --> 43:25.003
( music playing )
