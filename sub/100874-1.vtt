WEBVTT

02:21.208 --> 02:22.709
Oh.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.112
Oh.

02:48.098 --> 02:48.664
Mm.

03:33.302 --> 03:35.404
...joining
me now from Bubba's Trading.

03:35.503 --> 03:37.406
John Horowitz, Joe
Barton is still with us.

03:37.505 --> 03:40.041
All right, you tweet
as much as I do...

03:45.511 --> 03:49.349
your thoughts on
the action so far.

03:59.357 --> 04:07.530
Hey, Cal.

04:07.630 --> 04:08.764
It's Jimmy.

04:08.865 --> 04:10.466
I hope I'm not calling too late.

04:10.565 --> 04:11.334
Hey, Jim.

04:11.434 --> 04:12.768
No problem.

04:12.869 --> 04:15.003
I recall you saying that
your boy had a doe tag.

04:15.103 --> 04:17.005
Yeah, he
hasn't got anything yet.

04:17.105 --> 04:18.240
Well, uh, listen.

04:18.340 --> 04:22.510
I don't have a doe permit,
but I shot one today.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.945
I thought maybe you
could send Benji down.

04:25.046 --> 04:27.380
He could tag it and then
take him off my hands.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.515
Sounds real good.

04:28.614 --> 04:30.749
We'd definitely use the meat.

04:30.850 --> 04:33.452
Remember that place
we fished in the spring?

04:33.551 --> 04:35.254
That's the little
turnout that overlooked

04:35.354 --> 04:36.355
the St. John's river.

04:36.455 --> 04:37.289
I remember.

04:37.389 --> 04:39.090
We can be there by 8:00.

04:39.190 --> 04:39.589
All right.

04:39.689 --> 04:40.324
All right.

04:40.425 --> 04:41.325
Well, good.

04:41.426 --> 04:42.393
We'll see you tomorrow then.

04:42.493 --> 04:43.795
Good night.

04:43.895 --> 04:44.828
Yep, we'll
see you in the morning.

05:52.418 --> 06:03.327
It's good to see
you [inaudible]

06:09.799 --> 06:11.300
Sure, it's two years.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.702
The government [inaudible] up
the research fund by $2 million

06:14.803 --> 06:17.705
in hopes of speeding
up work on the cure.

06:17.806 --> 06:21.275
Advertisers are often
faced with the problem of...

08:09.565 --> 08:10.132
Ah.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.108
Yeah.

08:24.144 --> 08:24.511
Yeah.

08:33.518 --> 08:34.086
Yeah.

08:39.690 --> 08:40.524
Yeah.

08:40.625 --> 08:41.993
Oh.

08:42.093 --> 08:44.295
Shit!

08:44.395 --> 08:44.995
Ah!

08:57.438 --> 08:59.742
Mm.

09:15.287 --> 09:15.854
Ah.

09:37.339 --> 09:38.240
Oh, heavens.

10:23.077 --> 10:24.244
Objection.

10:24.345 --> 10:26.612
Rick Manson's World
Motion tour is over.

10:26.713 --> 10:27.947
And what a success it was.

10:28.047 --> 10:30.016
Manson is being
[inaudible] across Canada

10:30.116 --> 10:39.390
[inaudible] journey is over.

10:39.490 --> 10:42.393
The battle against heart
disease must continue.

10:42.493 --> 10:45.195
Tom and Harriet Banks are
the lucky winners of the...

11:07.414 --> 11:07.948
All right, buddy.

11:08.048 --> 11:09.148
Good to see you.

11:23.293 --> 11:23.828
Hey, Jim.

11:23.927 --> 11:24.561
How are you doing?

11:24.661 --> 11:25.329
Hey, Billy.

11:25.429 --> 11:25.864
How you doing?

11:25.963 --> 11:26.562
Real good.

11:26.662 --> 11:28.631
Real good.

11:28.732 --> 11:30.566
You signing out?

11:30.666 --> 11:32.034
Yeah.

11:32.135 --> 11:33.435
Sorry to keep you
waiting there, Jim.

11:33.535 --> 11:35.537
You could have just dropped
the note in the box.

11:35.637 --> 11:38.273
Eh.

11:38.372 --> 11:40.241
Jim, do you remember
what day you came in?

11:43.043 --> 11:46.079
Three or four
days ago, I think.

11:46.179 --> 11:51.383
What would that be,
the 10th or 11th, maybe?

11:51.483 --> 11:53.820
OK, here we go.

11:53.919 --> 11:54.953
Yeah.

11:55.053 --> 11:56.421
Paulie signed you
in on the 10th.

11:56.521 --> 11:56.889
Yeah, right.

11:56.988 --> 11:59.357
Yeah.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.893
How's that rig
holding up for you?

12:00.992 --> 12:02.226
Jesus, Bill.

12:02.325 --> 12:04.862
She's got over 100,000
miles on her already.

12:04.961 --> 12:07.130
That's good.

12:07.230 --> 12:09.031
Whatever happened with that
cabin you were looking at out

12:09.131 --> 12:10.834
past the Blacks' property?

12:10.933 --> 12:12.368
Just didn't work out.

12:12.468 --> 12:17.672
Anyway, that's my home now,
out there in the [inaudible]

12:17.773 --> 12:18.940
Nobody's going
to pin you down.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.041
That's for sure.

12:20.141 --> 12:21.776
You're damn straight.

12:21.876 --> 12:25.512
So what are you going to
do, head back to [inaudible]??

12:25.612 --> 12:26.713
No.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.047
I'm going to spend
the night in town.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.549
Then I'll come back out
here for about a week.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.651
I still want to bag
my buck this season.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.953
Sounds like a plan.

12:35.053 --> 12:36.688
Take care, Jim.

12:36.789 --> 12:42.460
Oh, Billy, did you guys happen
to open up that washed out area

12:42.560 --> 12:44.461
of the Pinkham Road yet?

12:44.561 --> 12:45.295
Yeah.

12:45.395 --> 12:47.163
Yeah, they did a few weeks ago.

12:47.263 --> 12:48.732
There's nobody at that
checkpoint, though.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.133
They just started to...

12:50.232 --> 12:51.901
I don't know... to renovate
the shack or something.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.571
So just be careful if
you go in that way.

12:55.671 --> 12:56.738
There's no way to track you.

12:56.839 --> 12:58.039
Will do.

12:58.139 --> 13:00.809
Thanks for the info.

13:00.909 --> 13:01.944
Have a good one.

13:02.043 --> 13:03.176
Take care, Jim.

13:17.388 --> 13:20.191
Y'all done there, Mr. Reed?

13:20.290 --> 13:22.092
Can I get you some more coffee?

13:22.192 --> 13:23.026
Yeah, that'd be great.

13:23.126 --> 13:25.596
Thank you.

13:25.697 --> 13:28.631
Did you read about the
robbery at the casino yesterday?

13:28.732 --> 13:30.666
Those people that got shot?

13:30.767 --> 13:31.702
So sad.

13:31.802 --> 13:33.168
I did.

13:33.268 --> 13:35.003
It seems to be the way the
world is now, doesn't it?

13:35.103 --> 13:36.438
You could say that again.

13:36.538 --> 13:37.472
Mm.

13:37.572 --> 13:39.941
So how long are you
up here this time?

13:40.074 --> 13:42.109
I think another week.

13:42.209 --> 13:44.277
I just want to get out
there and bag my buck.

13:44.377 --> 13:46.346
A friend of my husband's
got one the other day.

13:46.446 --> 13:46.914
Ah.

13:47.013 --> 13:48.014
They're around.

13:48.114 --> 13:50.116
Sure is cold enough.

13:50.215 --> 13:52.117
Yeah, let's hope
it stays that way.

13:52.217 --> 13:54.386
Well, I'll keep my
fingers crossed for you.

13:54.486 --> 13:54.954
Yeah.

13:55.053 --> 13:56.021
OK, thank you.

13:56.121 --> 13:57.054
See you next time.

13:57.154 --> 13:58.256
All right.

15:13.085 --> 15:15.587
And a
save again by McGovern.

15:15.688 --> 15:17.589
Three seconds to go.

15:17.690 --> 15:19.758
And on the final night
of the regular season,

15:19.858 --> 15:21.693
the Maine Blacks
have just played

15:21.793 --> 15:25.095
their best game of 2018, '19.

15:25.195 --> 15:27.563
They win, 6-nothing.

15:32.367 --> 15:33.703
- A
- government spokesman

15:33.803 --> 15:36.504
has stated that there is
not much truth in the rumor

15:36.605 --> 15:39.306
that the Pentagon wastefully
dumped military equipment

15:39.406 --> 15:42.043
and supplies costing
millions, perhaps billions,

15:42.142 --> 15:46.646
of taxpayer dollars in the years
since the Vietnam War started.

16:12.869 --> 16:16.705
Hi.

16:16.805 --> 16:19.540
Hi, Debbie.

16:19.641 --> 16:20.742
Listen, I...

16:20.842 --> 16:23.243
I'm sorry that you had
to see that yesterday.

16:23.343 --> 16:25.512
It was very unprofessional.

16:25.612 --> 16:26.579
No, no.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.581
It's OK, really.

16:28.682 --> 16:31.150
It's all right.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.953
Are you all right?

16:34.053 --> 16:35.286
Yeah.

16:35.387 --> 16:39.523
It's... it's my daughter's
been sick lately.

16:42.593 --> 16:44.762
Some husband and wife
stuff too, I guess.

16:47.865 --> 16:48.699
It's just so strange.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.905
Nothing is as I
imagined it would be.

16:56.004 --> 17:01.542
It never is, for anyone.

17:01.642 --> 17:02.242
Yeah.

17:04.812 --> 17:07.647
No, maybe you're right.

17:07.748 --> 17:09.415
Sometimes I say this
is the day that I'm

17:09.515 --> 17:13.252
just going to get out
of here and actually

17:13.352 --> 17:16.354
see myself doing it.

17:16.454 --> 17:20.058
Play the whole thing
out in my head.

17:20.158 --> 17:23.895
And one day ends,
and I'm still here.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.066
I'm sorry.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.667
I can't believe
I just said that.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.735
It's OK.

17:32.835 --> 17:33.435
I get it.

17:38.073 --> 17:38.940
More than you'll ever know.

17:47.213 --> 17:50.016
You remind me of my daughter.

17:50.116 --> 17:51.349
She was just like you.

17:54.754 --> 17:55.353
Really?

17:58.156 --> 17:58.724
Yeah.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.326
Debbie.

18:06.831 --> 18:10.100
I should go grab that.

18:10.200 --> 18:10.767
OK.

20:01.293 --> 20:02.392
It's so
hard to describe.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.628
I mean, it's like...

20:04.728 --> 20:07.631
it's like my insides are
just being eaten away.

20:09.999 --> 20:14.569
And well, drinking, that's
the only way I can fix it.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.738
Part of it comes from
my time overseas...

20:19.373 --> 20:23.778
what I saw, things I
did when I was serving.

20:26.713 --> 20:28.949
And I take it all out
on my wife and kids.

20:32.584 --> 20:34.519
I love them so much.

20:34.620 --> 20:37.690
And every day, I
just want to leave

20:37.789 --> 20:42.327
and not torture them anymore.

20:42.426 --> 20:45.729
I turn to God.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.430
I go to church.

20:47.530 --> 20:49.166
And I pray.

20:49.266 --> 20:53.002
And I ask God to forgive me.

20:53.102 --> 20:54.904
But He's nowhere to be found.

20:58.439 --> 20:59.074
I can't find Him.

21:23.661 --> 21:25.896
You said you served?

21:25.996 --> 21:27.330
Yes, sir.

21:27.463 --> 21:29.531
Two tours in the
sand with the army.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.101
Infantry, 3rd ID.

21:32.201 --> 21:34.370
Nam, me, Marines.

21:34.469 --> 21:35.037
The 2-1.

21:39.073 --> 21:41.175
Jim Reed.

21:41.276 --> 21:43.244
George [inaudible]

21:43.344 --> 21:46.179
Those were some powerful
words you said up there earlier.

21:48.882 --> 21:49.448
Been there.

21:51.984 --> 21:53.719
Same exact place.

21:53.819 --> 21:54.954
It's fucking rough, man.

21:57.756 --> 22:01.326
My little girl has been in
and out of the hospital.

22:01.425 --> 22:02.492
I don't know how to help her.

22:04.862 --> 22:08.031
Those fucking doctors, they
just talk at you, you know?

22:12.802 --> 22:15.938
I got to get my shit together.

22:16.038 --> 22:17.773
They ain't going to
make it without me.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.843
You married?

22:22.944 --> 22:23.543
I was.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.684
Kids?

22:30.784 --> 22:31.184
Yeah.

22:35.586 --> 22:39.357
Any chance you could fix it?

22:39.456 --> 22:41.292
No, my daughter's gone.

22:41.392 --> 22:47.197
And my son and I haven't talked
with each other in a year.

22:50.399 --> 22:53.535
I'm not quite there yet.

22:53.636 --> 22:55.271
Any advice?

22:55.371 --> 22:58.974
If I had any good advice,
I probably wouldn't be here.

23:00.275 --> 23:01.742
Yeah, right.

23:01.842 --> 23:02.242
Huh.

23:05.012 --> 23:07.714
Just take it one day
at a time, George.

23:07.814 --> 23:08.982
That's all any of us can do.

23:11.451 --> 23:12.018
Yeah.

23:14.619 --> 23:16.520
There's my ride.

23:16.621 --> 23:18.090
I gotta get going.

23:18.190 --> 23:18.790
OK.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.759
Yeah.

23:21.859 --> 23:22.760
See ya.

24:14.636 --> 24:17.139
Hey, Mr. Reed.

24:17.239 --> 24:18.473
Hi, Debbie.

24:18.572 --> 24:19.673
Hey, Jeff, do
you want to take Ali,

24:19.774 --> 24:21.175
you guys go eat in the car?

24:21.275 --> 24:21.909
I'll be right there.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.514
Late night?

24:27.614 --> 24:30.784
I saw your truck outside
Wheeler's last night.

24:30.884 --> 24:33.318
I hope I'm not out of line here.

24:36.121 --> 24:39.223
I remember you
saying you're sober.

24:39.323 --> 24:42.360
Yeah, it's been a long time.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.261
I didn't slip.

24:43.361 --> 24:45.028
Yeah, I know.

24:45.128 --> 24:47.130
I could tell.

24:47.230 --> 24:48.999
Close, though, right?

24:49.099 --> 24:52.768
I've had some
experience with it.

24:52.868 --> 24:56.071
You know, there's some really
good meetings around town.

24:56.171 --> 24:56.805
Yeah, yeah.

24:56.905 --> 24:57.372
I know.

24:57.472 --> 24:58.073
Yeah.

25:00.275 --> 25:00.942
All right.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.176
Well, I should...

25:02.276 --> 25:03.644
I should get going.

25:03.744 --> 25:07.448
Probably murdering each
other in the back of the car.

You too.

25:13.319 --> 25:13.885

Thank you.

25:38.574 --> 25:39.874
a sound theory right now?

25:39.974 --> 25:41.442
I think
it's a very sound theory.

25:41.542 --> 25:46.079
I would be very surprised if
we go back [inaudible] Charles.

25:46.179 --> 25:48.381

God damn it!

28:39.323 --> 28:41.727
Oh, my god.

Good evening.

31:09.683 --> 31:11.551
Wha... oh.

31:11.651 --> 31:12.318
Evening.

31:12.418 --> 31:16.154
Uh, ah, I, uh...

31:16.254 --> 31:17.623
I'm sorry, I... I didn't...

31:17.723 --> 31:18.758
I didn't see you.

31:18.858 --> 31:20.157
I thought maybe
you were sleeping.

31:20.257 --> 31:21.760
I put my details in the box.

31:21.860 --> 31:22.761
I forgot a couple of things.

31:22.861 --> 31:24.094
I got to go back into town.

31:24.194 --> 31:26.530
No fucking bother at all.

31:26.630 --> 31:28.799
How about a cup of coffee?

31:28.931 --> 31:31.266
Coffee?

31:31.366 --> 31:31.900
Oh, no.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.101
Uh, no, thank you.

31:33.201 --> 31:34.804
I... I really am in
a bit of a hurry.

31:34.903 --> 31:36.471
This late at night?

31:36.572 --> 31:38.305
Get the fuck out of here.

31:38.406 --> 31:39.440
Come on.

31:39.541 --> 31:42.376
I insist.

31:42.476 --> 31:43.844
Yeah, OK.

31:43.943 --> 31:44.545
What the fuck?

31:44.645 --> 31:45.211
Why not?

31:53.452 --> 31:54.353
Huh?

31:54.453 --> 31:56.688
You want a splash?

You know, I love the
night shift out here.

32:08.832 --> 32:09.432
No bullshit.

32:12.034 --> 32:16.237
Used to have a dog that
would come out here with me.

32:16.337 --> 32:17.272
Mm.

32:27.848 --> 32:31.017
She's the boss, I guess.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.519
Guess that leaves
me shit out of luck.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.421
You know what I'm saying?

32:36.522 --> 32:38.422
I can turn up the
heat if you're cold.

32:38.523 --> 32:38.890
No, no.

32:38.989 --> 32:39.891
I'm good.

32:39.990 --> 32:41.459
Thanks.

32:41.560 --> 32:49.732
What?

32:49.833 --> 32:51.233
Is that blood on your jacket?

32:53.770 --> 32:54.571
Looks pretty fresh.

32:58.005 --> 33:00.174
Didn't get to see what
you had on your truck

33:00.274 --> 33:01.876
when you pulled in.

33:01.975 --> 33:03.811
You, uh, shoot
something out there?

33:03.911 --> 33:04.712
No.

33:04.812 --> 33:05.613
I didn't shoot anything.

33:05.713 --> 33:07.146
You sure about that?

33:07.246 --> 33:07.848
Because you got to report
anything you shoot out there.

33:07.948 --> 33:08.615
No.

33:08.715 --> 33:11.016
No, I know that.

33:11.116 --> 33:16.988
It's just... I'm sick, OK?

33:17.088 --> 33:17.656
I'm sick.

33:21.425 --> 33:25.596
I cough up blood
every once in a while.

33:25.696 --> 33:27.430
I had a wicked episode today.

33:30.099 --> 33:33.703
It was fucking brutal.

33:33.803 --> 33:37.304
Is that the
cancer or something?

33:37.404 --> 33:39.741
I... you know, you
just reminded me.

33:39.841 --> 33:43.042
I need to go out

33:46.680 --> 33:47.447
Thanks for the coffee.

35:15.588 --> 35:16.855
Is that it?

35:16.956 --> 35:17.856
A pack of Bilsons.

35:32.668 --> 35:36.806
All right, $67.75.

35:36.905 --> 35:37.672
Shit.

35:37.772 --> 35:38.607
I'm out of quarters.

35:38.707 --> 35:39.608
Give me a sec.

35:39.708 --> 35:45.579
Uh...

35:54.654 --> 36:01.525
Sir... Sir.

36:04.028 --> 36:05.228
Is that your RV outside?

36:10.600 --> 36:14.637
The custom job... never
seen anything like that.

36:14.737 --> 36:15.436
Yeah.

36:15.537 --> 36:18.107
Made down in the Carolinas.

36:18.206 --> 36:20.273
How's the gas mileage?

36:20.374 --> 36:22.442
Oh, she's pretty so-so.

36:35.021 --> 36:35.921
There you go.

36:36.022 --> 36:36.921
Thank you.

36:37.022 --> 36:38.490
Have a good night.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.280
Two shots of whiskey.

37:08.380 --> 37:09.949
You're going to actually
drink them this time?

37:10.050 --> 37:11.551
Just pour the
fucking shots, OK?

37:28.065 --> 37:28.632
Again.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.477
Do you believe that shit?

37:51.551 --> 37:53.019
Recapping
our top story,

37:53.119 --> 37:56.021
a massive manhunt continues
tonight as authorities search

37:56.121 --> 37:59.658
for five suspects in a violent
armed robbery at the Franklin

37:59.758 --> 38:00.925
Casino two days ago.

38:01.025 --> 38:03.359
The robbery led to a shootout
between casino security

38:03.461 --> 38:05.863
and the suspects, leaving
three security guards

38:05.963 --> 38:09.065
dead and 12 civilians injured.

38:09.165 --> 38:11.935
Earlier today, authorities
released surveillance camera

38:12.035 --> 38:14.435
images of two of
the five suspects,

38:14.536 --> 38:16.739
hoping for the public's
help in identifying them.

38:16.839 --> 38:18.607
According to the
casino, the crew made

38:18.706 --> 38:22.176
off with close to $1.2 million.

38:22.275 --> 38:25.377
Police believe the suspects may
be headed north for the border.

38:25.479 --> 38:28.048
The five are considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

38:28.148 --> 38:31.717
If you spot them, call the
state police immediately.

38:31.817 --> 38:34.553
In other news, a water main
break near During Avenue caused

38:34.653 --> 38:36.021
major flooding earlier today.

38:55.302 --> 38:56.671
Oh, fuck!

39:04.578 --> 39:15.654

Oh.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.428
Oh, shit.

41:24.527 --> 41:27.430
Jesus Christ.

41:49.215 --> 41:49.782
George?

41:53.953 --> 41:56.688
What in the fuck are
you doing out here?

41:56.788 --> 41:57.389
Huntin'.

41:57.489 --> 41:58.990
Huntin'?

41:59.090 --> 42:00.824
What the fuck else
would I be doing out here?

42:04.295 --> 42:05.462
Are you OK?

42:05.562 --> 42:06.463
Yeah.

42:06.562 --> 42:07.730
Yeah, so where's the money?

42:07.830 --> 42:09.098
I think it's
right fucking here, OK?

42:13.802 --> 42:15.070
Where's the fucking money?

42:15.170 --> 42:17.139
It was right here.

42:17.239 --> 42:21.142
What the fuck
is going out here?

42:21.242 --> 42:23.044
Get the fuck out of here now.

42:23.144 --> 42:24.111
What?

42:24.211 --> 42:24.811
Run.

43:34.136 --> 43:34.970
Give us the money!

43:37.939 --> 43:43.677
You do, and you
both can walk away!

43:43.777 --> 43:46.546
You don't want me to
hurt your friend again.

43:46.646 --> 43:47.448
Your friend.

43:47.547 --> 43:49.483
What's his fucking name?

43:49.582 --> 43:50.182
Ji... Jim.

43:50.282 --> 43:51.217
Jim.

43:51.317 --> 43:52.952
But he's not my fuckin' friend.

43:53.052 --> 43:53.586
Jim what?

43:53.686 --> 43:54.353
I don't know.

43:54.453 --> 43:56.389
I just met him!

43:56.489 --> 43:58.957
What's it going to be, Jim?

43:59.057 --> 44:02.026
Give them
the fucking money!

44:02.126 --> 44:05.529
I have a wife and kid!

44:05.629 --> 44:07.530
What's it going to be, Jim?

44:07.630 --> 44:11.234
Give them the money, Jim!

44:11.334 --> 44:13.635
Last fucking chance!

44:13.735 --> 44:16.506
Give them the money!

44:21.476 --> 44:22.076
Find him.

44:29.249 --> 44:30.383
Skip, hold up.

44:30.483 --> 44:32.284
There's fucking
tracks everywhere.

44:32.385 --> 44:34.219
Yeah, same over here.

44:34.319 --> 44:35.388
All right.

44:35.488 --> 44:36.587
Come on with me.

47:53.219 --> 47:56.522
[inaudible]

47:56.622 --> 48:00.091
Oh, you son of a
bitch, you bastards!

48:04.596 --> 48:07.497
You runt mother fuckers!

48:10.601 --> 48:13.502
Fuck you!

50:51.368 --> 50:52.167
Oh.

50:52.267 --> 50:52.868
Oh.

53:51.918 --> 53:53.386
Fuck.

54:53.135 --> 54:55.671
I have your gun!

54:55.771 --> 54:58.139
Just come out and give
us the money back.

54:58.239 --> 54:59.441
We won't hurt you.

55:02.142 --> 55:04.312
Jim Reed!

55:04.412 --> 55:07.146
We know everything about you.

55:07.246 --> 55:10.650
Don't make us find your
son, Steve, and his family.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.782
Frank, where are you?

56:28.882 --> 56:30.383
Do you see him?

57:07.580 --> 57:09.849
Oh, shit.

57:09.949 --> 57:10.550
Fuck!

59:51.717 --> 59:52.318
Ah!

1:00:15.771 --> 1:00:17.072
God damn it!

1:02:05.329 --> 1:02:05.929
Mm!

1:03:56.255 --> 1:03:57.555
Come on.

1:03:57.655 --> 1:03:58.757
Oh, fuck!

1:06:04.395 --> 1:06:04.962
Shit.

1:09:59.856 --> 1:10:01.693
Maybe we should just
go, Skip and Frank.

1:10:01.793 --> 1:10:03.994
Yeah, is that
what you think, huh?

1:10:04.094 --> 1:10:05.562
Take a good look around.

1:10:05.662 --> 1:10:08.432
This is what you're thinking
got us, you and that dead bitch!

1:10:08.532 --> 1:10:11.400
She told us it was the
perfect place to hide

1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:12.301
the cash before we went...

1:10:12.401 --> 1:10:14.903
And you're a genius!

1:10:15.003 --> 1:10:19.840
If you weren't my son, I'd
fucking kill you right now!

1:10:19.940 --> 1:10:22.842
I'm done waiting.

1:10:28.449 --> 1:10:30.450
Stay here!

1:10:30.550 --> 1:10:31.883
And try not to fuck that up!

1:11:55.788 --> 1:11:57.088
May I at least
put my dick away?

1:12:11.901 --> 1:12:12.468
Don't do this.

1:12:15.704 --> 1:12:19.072
I wasn't going to do
anything to you, I promise.

1:12:19.174 --> 1:12:23.510
That's why I'm here
and not out there.

1:12:23.610 --> 1:12:24.878
Doesn't matter.

1:12:24.977 --> 1:12:26.580
Why doesn't it matter?

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:29.282
Because I don't give a shit.

1:12:29.382 --> 1:12:30.982
You know it's my
girlfriend you killed.

1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:36.188
So?

1:12:40.858 --> 1:12:47.697
So if you want to call it
even, can we just do that?

1:12:47.797 --> 1:12:50.966
Can you just let me go?

1:12:51.066 --> 1:12:52.302
We'll call it even.

1:15:43.978 --> 1:15:46.479
Hey!

1:16:33.753 --> 1:16:36.621
Are you kidding me?

1:16:36.721 --> 1:16:41.059
I can fucking see you
behind that icicle.

1:16:41.158 --> 1:16:44.628
You put me through all
this shit for this?

1:16:44.728 --> 1:16:47.230
This is all the
stuff you got for me?

1:16:47.330 --> 1:16:49.165
Move real slow, man.

1:16:52.235 --> 1:16:53.268
Throw the gun out.

1:16:53.368 --> 1:16:54.569
I don't have a gun.

1:16:54.670 --> 1:16:58.706
All right, then show
me both your hands.

1:16:58.806 --> 1:16:59.874
Good.

1:16:59.974 --> 1:17:00.574
All right, come on.

1:17:00.675 --> 1:17:02.077
Let's go.

1:17:02.176 --> 1:17:05.079
Yeah, yeah.

1:17:05.178 --> 1:17:07.148
All right.

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.282
There you go.

1:17:09.382 --> 1:17:10.482
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1:17:10.582 --> 1:17:11.450
Ha ha!

1:17:11.550 --> 1:17:13.185
Really?

1:17:13.285 --> 1:17:14.553
Are you fucking serious?

1:17:18.956 --> 1:17:21.893
You're a joke.

1:17:21.993 --> 1:17:23.894
Oh, this is pathetic.

1:17:23.994 --> 1:17:24.961
Lose the fucking knife.

1:17:31.434 --> 1:17:35.270
All right, enough games.

1:17:35.370 --> 1:17:36.304
Where is it?

1:17:36.404 --> 1:17:38.707
Where is what?

1:17:38.807 --> 1:17:40.974
I was out here hunting.

1:17:41.076 --> 1:17:42.309
Yeah, you and me both.

1:17:42.409 --> 1:17:44.945
I saw you running with
the bag, you asshole.

1:17:45.045 --> 1:17:47.147
Now where the fuck is it?

1:17:47.246 --> 1:17:50.416
And that's the last time
I'm going to ask you.

1:17:50.516 --> 1:17:52.484
All right, I'll
take you to it.

1:17:52.584 --> 1:17:58.057
Then you get up and
you take me to it.

1:17:58.157 --> 1:17:59.857
Hurry the fuck up.

1:17:59.957 --> 1:18:01.525
I'm moving as fast as I can.

1:18:04.394 --> 1:18:06.796
You better not
be fucking with me.

1:18:06.896 --> 1:18:12.401
If you are, I'll kill your
son and his whole damn family.

1:18:12.501 --> 1:18:13.368
You know that, right?

1:18:16.206 --> 1:18:19.574
I'd kill your daughter
too, but looks

1:18:19.674 --> 1:18:23.410
like you took care of that one.

1:18:23.510 --> 1:18:27.280
Yeah, I went through
all your shit.

1:18:30.150 --> 1:18:34.019
Oh, she's beautiful.

1:18:34.121 --> 1:18:35.787
Too fucking bad about that one.

1:18:40.457 --> 1:18:45.230
Must suck living with
the fact that your kid

1:18:45.329 --> 1:18:46.496
died because of you.

1:18:49.298 --> 1:18:51.400
Lot of fucking guilt there.

1:18:55.071 --> 1:18:56.371
Bet you wish you
could have saved

1:18:56.471 --> 1:18:59.006
her, been the fucking hero.

1:19:02.810 --> 1:19:03.444
How much longer?

1:19:08.948 --> 1:19:10.349
How much fucking longer?

1:19:10.449 --> 1:19:11.350
We're almost there.

1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:32.968
That was your kid in the Chevy.

1:19:36.038 --> 1:19:39.275
How the fuck do you know that?

1:19:39.374 --> 1:19:41.008
You know, you're right.

1:19:41.109 --> 1:19:44.545
I did kill my daughter.

1:19:44.645 --> 1:19:46.379
I did.

1:19:46.479 --> 1:19:49.916
Seems I have a tendency
for killing kids.

1:19:50.016 --> 1:19:53.152
What the fuck does that mean?

1:19:53.252 --> 1:19:55.154
I shot him.

1:19:55.254 --> 1:19:56.255
Who?

1:19:56.354 --> 1:19:56.922
Your son.

1:20:02.693 --> 1:20:07.530
He was taking a piss, and
I shot him in the face.

1:20:07.630 --> 1:20:08.898
Are you fucking with me?

1:20:08.998 --> 1:20:09.833
No.

1:20:09.933 --> 1:20:11.067
He's dead.

1:20:11.167 --> 1:20:12.935
You motherfucker!

1:20:13.036 --> 1:20:13.969
You are a dead man.

1:20:14.070 --> 1:20:14.736
Go ahead.

1:20:14.837 --> 1:20:16.671
Fucking kill me.

1:20:16.771 --> 1:20:19.874
How you gonna find the money?

1:20:19.974 --> 1:20:20.875
Fuck!

1:20:20.975 --> 1:20:22.475
No, get the fuck off me.

1:20:40.958 --> 1:20:42.993
Ow.

1:20:43.094 --> 1:20:44.928
What the fuck did you do?

1:20:47.697 --> 1:20:51.235
Oh, what the... fucking...

1:20:51.335 --> 1:20:52.968
my fucking leg!

1:20:56.205 --> 1:20:57.106
Can't move my arm.

1:21:06.779 --> 1:21:10.983
Hey, you can't leave me here.

1:21:11.084 --> 1:21:12.551
Fuck, I'll split it with you.

1:21:16.654 --> 1:21:18.123
I'm gonna freeze to death.

1:21:21.893 --> 1:21:22.692
Fuck you!

1:23:39.475 --> 1:23:42.477
No, he talked about
leaving for a long time.

1:23:42.576 --> 1:23:44.178
Well, I just never
thought he'd do it.

1:23:51.251 --> 1:23:51.917
No, no.

1:23:52.018 --> 1:23:54.420
I'm doing OK.

1:23:54.519 --> 1:23:56.255
Yeah.

1:23:56.355 --> 1:23:57.156
I'm getting used to it.

1:24:01.226 --> 1:24:02.726
I just feel so bad for the kids.

1:24:06.230 --> 1:24:07.131
No, you're right.

1:24:07.231 --> 1:24:08.098
No, I need to move on.

1:24:12.402 --> 1:24:15.138
Oh, hey, I gotta
get back in there.

1:24:15.238 --> 1:24:16.271
Yeah.

1:24:16.371 --> 1:24:18.106
No, I'll call you
after my shift.

1:24:18.206 --> 1:24:20.375
Yeah, 8:00.

1:24:20.475 --> 1:24:21.709
OK.

1:24:21.809 --> 1:24:22.842
No, I'll talk to you then.

1:24:22.942 --> 1:24:23.543
Thanks.

1:24:46.063 --> 1:24:46.396
Hey.

1:24:46.496 --> 1:24:47.897
Hey.

1:24:47.998 --> 1:24:48.831
You OK.

1:24:48.931 --> 1:24:49.299
Yeah.

1:24:49.399 --> 1:24:50.434
I'm good.

1:24:50.534 --> 1:24:52.134
Oh, some guy
left this for you.
