{\an5}You guys think
maybe we took
that game

10:20.620 --> 10:22.371

10:22.455 --> 10:24.540
{\an5}I mean, we
bust on Sam

a little fun.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.559

We're just joking around,
Sammy.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.536
You mean, you're not mad
about it anymore?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.205
What good are friends

11:04.455 --> 11:06.540

every now and then?

11:06.624 --> 11:07.666
Great.

All that work for nothing.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.673
SAMMY:
Squid Power version 2.0.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.759
I made this one a little
more realistic.

the Super Squid?

Give me that mouse, Sam.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.577
I bet I rule
at this game.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.537
No, way, dude.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.285

the cover.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.761
One of the

13:24.011 --> 13:25.721
only 16 when
he turned pro.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.098
{\an1}Oh, they sure are making them

to your sister.

every day.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.755
To join them,
I got to start getting serious.

So what are we
supposed to do?

make mine to go?

Bro, I thought we were
going to hang out.

{\an1}I don't have time
to "hang."

That's <i> all</i> you're doing?

Oh, no!

soon enough.

Now get this:
he's only 11!

19:43.223 --> 19:44.182
That's right.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.392
Double ones.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.311
Check it out.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.354
I can't believe it!

19:49.605 --> 19:52.900
Man, one little birthday,
and suddenly he's all different.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.651
TWISTER:
I don't know.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.070
He looks the same to me.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.489
We're talking about <i> inside.</i>

20:01.575 --> 20:04.036
Oh!

20:09.124 --> 20:09.249
Yeah!

20:23.722 --> 20:26.391
Oh, no!

20:26.642 --> 20:30.312
Whoa!

20:30.562 --> 20:32.439
Oh! What a bummer!

20:32.689 --> 20:35.400
It looks like young Otto needs
a few more years under his belt.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.235
ANNOUNCER:
Maybe next time, bro.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.157
(<i> grunts</i> )

20:42.240 --> 20:43.659
That was <i> totally</i> weak!

20:43.909 --> 20:44.993
Twist, erase
that tape now.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.745
I never want to see it.

20:46.995 --> 20:47.913
You got it, dude.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.122
{\an3}Hold on.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.084
Not so fast.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.504
{\an4}OTTO:
Just leave me alone,
you guys.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.130
Just watch the footage

20:57.214 --> 20:58.507
from this afternoon.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.758
I was there.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.426
I don't need to see it.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.470
Oh, no!

21:03.720 --> 21:05.931
Whoa!

21:06.181 --> 21:07.975
So, what's your point?

21:08.225 --> 21:11.103
Now this is footage
from your last surf session...

21:11.353 --> 21:12.270
when you were ten.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.113
Oh, yeah!

21:21.405 --> 21:24.199
So, what's the difference
between Otto at ten

21:24.282 --> 21:25.659
and Otto at 11?

21:25.909 --> 21:28.412
{\an1}Oh, Otto at 11
is a total lame-o.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.205
{\an1}TWISTER:
Otto

21:30.288 --> 21:31.915
{\an1}you love to surf,
you love to skateboard

21:32.165 --> 21:33.875
{\an1}and you love
to play hockey, right?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.961
And when you
enjoy yourself

21:36.211 --> 21:38.130
you're way better
at everything.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.923
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

21:40.173 --> 21:42.092
Yeah!

21:45.303 --> 21:47.472
Hey, I guess I am.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.682
Oh, yeah.

21:48.932 --> 21:49.891
(<i> chuckles</i> )

21:50.142 --> 21:52.019
But we forgive you

21:52.269 --> 21:54.229
{\an5}as long are you're
ready to hang out
with us again.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.064
Hanging out?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.317
Yeah, I think my schedule
has room for that.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.609
Whoa, whoa,<i> wait!</i>

22:02.029 --> 22:03.989
(<i> yelling</i> )

22:04.239 --> 22:06.199
(<i> thud</i> )

22:07.659 --> 22:08.577
(<i> Ray grunts</i> )

22:08.660 --> 22:09.578
Ow!

22:09.661 --> 22:11.580
Oh, boy!

22:11.830 --> 22:13.623
The young people
always falling down.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.500
I'm okay, I'm okay.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.088
Maybe somebody took
the getting-younger thing

22:20.172 --> 22:21.339
a little too far, too.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.966
That's not it.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.092
I am not trying
to be younger.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.554
Just trying to <i> feel</i> young...

22:27.804 --> 22:29.347
It's okay, Raymundo.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.184
{\an1}You're not the only one
who wasn't acting his age.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.436
You know
what the island sages say:

22:34.686 --> 22:36.396
{\an1}"You can paint
the coconut shell

22:36.646 --> 22:38.607
{\an1}but you can't change
the milk inside."

22:38.857 --> 22:41.651
Point well taken.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.820
So, who's up for heading out
to the waves

22:44.071 --> 22:45.280
just to goof around?

22:45.363 --> 22:46.365
(<i> agreeing comments</i> )

22:46.615 --> 22:49.618
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:49.868 --> 22:51.369
Spit it out.
