So... How bad did you guys
screw up the future?

10:28.917 --> 10:32.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I said we may have
altered things slightly.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.875
Yeah, we are probably
just overreacting.

The future looks amazing!

This is not how the future
is supposed to look.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.458
How could this
have happened?

11:04.542 --> 11:08.125
Okay, we need to hightail over to the Time
Bureau and find Mr. Block.

You stay close kid.

to look like that?

No, they are not.
They are not.

-They are like mutated pistachio trees.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.000
Dakota, could we have caused this by
saving that one plant?

11:38.083 --> 11:40.667
I don't think so.
But let's get over to the Time Bureau.

I know a back way.

11:43.834 --> 11:44.959

There's Float Cone.

given him top billing.

leave that behind.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.875
Sure.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

14:07.291 --> 14:08.125

with Cavendish and Dakota.

-Solid summary.
-Thanks for noticing.

get whatever they know,

what we do best.

14:45.458 --> 14:46.792

-None. Not even close.
-Nope.

on my first day.

without him.

Why'd you stop?

lost without him.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.792

so I'm lost.

we stop sliding.

that's my house.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.291
And now we are
in my front yard.

I keep my bread.

can use against these plants.

-[exclaiming]
-[snarling]

20:00.917 --> 20:02.291
Hey! Grab my hands.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.709
-[techno music playing]
-[snarling]

20:11.792 --> 20:13.500
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:13.583 --> 20:14.792
[growls]

20:14.875 --> 20:16.041
[screaming]

20:16.125 --> 20:18.625
[robotic voice]
Destination selected.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.542
[all snarling]

20:21.542 --> 20:22.667
Quickly, turn it off!

20:22.750 --> 20:24.667
-Can't. This thing's toast.
-Lemme see.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.875
Um, red wire, green wire,
blue!

20:28.041 --> 20:29.583
[all snarling]

20:33.166 --> 20:36.458
-Phew! Well done, champ.
-I really like this kid.

20:36.542 --> 20:37.917
Look, the Time Limo.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.709
Milo, land this thing over there.

20:39.792 --> 20:43.709
Okay. If by land you mean
bail out before we crash,

20:43.792 --> 20:45.959
-you got it. Get ready and...
-Well, I...

20:46.041 --> 20:47.375
-Now!
-[all grunt]

20:49.583 --> 20:50.750
[pistachios snarling]

20:52.750 --> 20:55.458
Oh, great! Here comes the nut jobbers
again. Let's get out of here.

20:55.542 --> 20:57.375
[growling and snarling]

20:57.458 --> 20:59.750
-We'll never get it moving.
-We don't have to.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.333
Just get in.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.500
[engine cranking]

21:03.583 --> 21:05.792
You're flooding it.
I'm not flooding it.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.959
So what's the next stop?

21:08.041 --> 21:10.041
To get some answers.
I have an idea.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.500
Oh! I really thought
we had them.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.208
[pistachio]
How cool is that time machine?

21:17.291 --> 21:20.792
Pile in, boys.
Time to take this show on the road.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.291
I call shotgun!

21:24.041 --> 21:27.250
Now, let's find those humans,
and destroy them.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.667
[muffled] Guys!
A little help here.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.458
Guys?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.792
Did we get them?

21:37.417 --> 21:39.417
Hello?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.709
Am I seeing
what I'm seeing?

21:41.792 --> 21:45.000
This is the lost episode.
The original pilot.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.125
The Seed Beasts.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.583
This was shot in 1965.

21:48.667 --> 21:52.250
Milo was, is on a show
that was shot over 50 years ago?

21:52.333 --> 21:54.959
[howling]

21:55.041 --> 21:57.667
I'm with Diogee.
What is going on?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.792
You got that from a "Roo?"

21:59.875 --> 22:01.792
[Dr. Zone] Only time will tell.

22:01.875 --> 22:06.417
[Dr. Zone reading]

22:21.040 --> 22:22.373
[thud]

22:22.664 --> 22:24.373
[Dakota]
Yeah, that ought to do it.

22:24.873 --> 22:27.290
-How far in time did we just travel?
-[door opens]

22:27.373 --> 22:29.623
Uh, ten minutes back
and one block over.

22:29.706 --> 22:32.706
That should buy us enough time to figure
out how all of this happened

22:32.789 --> 22:33.789
and how we can stop it.

22:33.873 --> 22:35.956
And maybe get
something to eat.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.623
What... We gotta keep up out strength, we
might have to fight giant... Oh, no!

22:39.706 --> 22:41.540
Oh, no, we have
to warn ourselves.

22:41.623 --> 22:43.540
[snarling]

22:43.623 --> 22:45.290
-What are we going to do?
-Wait.

22:45.373 --> 22:47.373
-Here, use this peach.
-Good idea.

22:47.457 --> 22:48.873
[grunts]

22:48.956 --> 22:50.290
[groans]

22:50.373 --> 22:51.457
A peach?

22:51.540 --> 22:53.290
Who the devil would
throw a peach?

22:53.373 --> 22:55.248
And who would
throw one away?

22:55.332 --> 22:57.040
Oh, no, quick,
take cover.

22:57.789 --> 22:59.582
Wait a moment,
where did you get that peach?

22:59.664 --> 23:00.956
Someone threw
it at you earlier.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.373
But that someone was me.

23:02.457 --> 23:04.373
-I know.
-But where did I get it?

23:04.457 --> 23:06.498
-From me.
-Yes, but where did you get it?

23:06.582 --> 23:08.415
Someone threw
it at you earlier.

23:08.498 --> 23:10.123
But that someone was me.

23:10.206 --> 23:11.498
-I know.
-But where did I get it?

23:11.582 --> 23:12.623
From me!

23:12.706 --> 23:14.415
Yes, but where did you get it?

23:14.498 --> 23:16.998
-Someone threw it at you earlier.
-But that some...

23:17.081 --> 23:19.415
[Sara] Melissa, why didn't you
bring us to your house?

23:19.498 --> 23:22.664
If there's a clue about Milo's
whereabouts, it'll be in here.

23:24.373 --> 23:25.415
[both gasping]

23:25.498 --> 23:26.415
[both] Whoa!

23:28.415 --> 23:31.248
Hey, do you do this
for all of your friends?

23:31.332 --> 23:35.457
-Where's mine?
-[chuckles] Oh, Zack!

23:35.540 --> 23:38.956
Melissa, why would you
collect all of this stuff?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.789
Yeah, some of this stuff
is weirdly specific.

23:41.873 --> 23:45.165
I started collecting this, thinking, maybe
I could figure it out, you know.

23:45.248 --> 23:46.748
Find a cure
for Murphy's Law.

23:46.831 --> 23:49.165
But then I realized,
Milo wouldn't want that.

23:49.248 --> 23:52.540
But for some reason,
I kept collecting info, so at least,

23:52.623 --> 23:56.457
maybe, I could reign it in or explain it
or monetize it.

23:56.540 --> 23:58.290
Uh, whose tooth is this?

23:58.373 --> 24:01.165
Here's the time we had to put all those
robots in a shark cage.

24:01.248 --> 24:04.332
Oh, and the time we had to go to that
lumber yard to apologize.

24:04.415 --> 24:05.457
Wait a minute.

24:05.540 --> 24:06.789
Who are these guys?

24:06.873 --> 24:09.457
-[Melissa] They look familiar.
-[Zack] Oh, those guys?

24:09.540 --> 24:12.498
I saw them up here, too.
Right here. And here.

24:12.582 --> 24:14.498
[Melissa] Don't they sell
pistachios or something?

24:14.582 --> 24:18.623
Weird! They're dressed like Dr. Zone and
Time Ape in every picture.

24:18.706 --> 24:21.290
-What does that mean?
-It can't be a co-incidence.

24:21.373 --> 24:24.540
Milo in the episode,
these two in all these pictures.

24:24.623 --> 24:26.457
There's a Dr. Zone connection.

24:26.540 --> 24:28.789
With her, it's always a Dr.
Zone connection.

24:28.914 --> 24:30.081
I know, right?

24:30.165 --> 24:32.540
The library's holographic
data array should provide

24:32.623 --> 24:34.914
some information about
this plant up rising.

24:34.998 --> 24:37.664
World domination,
world domination by Llamas...

24:37.748 --> 24:41.664
So, how does this Murphy's Law thing work,
anyway. What makes it happen?

24:41.748 --> 24:44.165
I don't know, really.
I'm just caught in its crosslink.

24:44.248 --> 24:45.706
How about time travel?
How does that work?

24:45.789 --> 24:48.498
[chuckles] No idea. We literally
just push a button.

24:48.582 --> 24:52.664
Some guy name Professor Time invented it
years ago, for you.

24:52.748 --> 24:54.415
Years from now, I guess.

24:54.498 --> 24:57.956
Wait, the guy who invented time travel
was named Professor Time?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.664
Yeah, so?

24:59.748 --> 25:02.582
Oh, hey, that's a coincidence.
What are the odds?

25:02.664 --> 25:05.248
Yeah, he probably
had it changed for branding purposes.

25:05.332 --> 25:06.914
Whoo! I found something.
Look at this.

25:11.706 --> 25:14.540
Hello and welcome to
the hollow key...

25:14.623 --> 25:15.457
-Push any...
-Shh!

25:15.540 --> 25:17.248
Keep your voice down for goodness sake.

25:17.332 --> 25:20.540
Give us the abridged version of the
pistachio plant's "Conquest of the World."

25:20.623 --> 25:22.123
Uh, quietly.

25:22.206 --> 25:23.706
Okay! Sheesh!

25:25.457 --> 25:29.582
It all started with a small pistachio
plant in a middle school courtyard.

25:29.664 --> 25:31.206
[Milo] Hey, that's my school.

25:31.290 --> 25:34.623
As the plant grew, it gained
intelligence and sentience

25:34.706 --> 25:38.748
and eventually uprooted itself
and became King Pistashion.

25:38.831 --> 25:40.582
Hey, that's the guy
we saw out there.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.373
And he started in the courtyard
of my middle school.

25:43.457 --> 25:45.206
What are the odds?

25:45.290 --> 25:46.789
You're right, even money.

25:46.873 --> 25:49.748
The King Pistashion ultimately took over
the capital building,

25:49.831 --> 25:53.914
at Time Travel Bureau.
They immediately rounded up all the clock.

25:53.998 --> 25:55.248
Why would they do
a thing like that?

25:55.332 --> 25:56.415
It makes no sense.

25:56.498 --> 25:57.623
-[all gasps]
-Got you!

25:57.706 --> 25:59.914
We were being deliberately
obtuse about that clock thing.

25:59.998 --> 26:02.623
But, hey, this must be
Cavendish and Dakota.

26:02.706 --> 26:03.706
But who's this?

26:04.206 --> 26:05.706
Milo Murphy.

26:05.789 --> 26:08.081
Well, now that we have you
and your Time Vehicle,

26:08.165 --> 26:09.914
no one will be able
to go back in time

26:09.998 --> 26:11.582
and alter
the king's existence.

26:11.664 --> 26:13.914
Oh, yeah? Well, there's one thing you
haven't accounted for.

26:13.998 --> 26:15.290
I don't think so.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.748
We got the Time Travelers,
we got the Time Vehicle.

26:17.831 --> 26:19.748
We even got some
random middle school kid.

26:19.831 --> 26:21.664
-[blurred speech]
-[grunts]

26:21.748 --> 26:23.248
Oh, what in the
world was that?

26:24.373 --> 26:27.248
Murphy's Law, nutjober.

26:27.332 --> 26:29.664
Come on, let's go.
The Time Limo is just outside.

26:31.831 --> 26:32.831
[all gasping]

26:35.415 --> 26:37.664
-Ha!
-Okay, that does it.

26:37.748 --> 26:40.290
Milo, get behind me,
I'm gonna clock this guy.

26:40.373 --> 26:42.956
-Get it? 'Cause it's a bag of clocks.
-I get it!

26:44.873 --> 26:46.623
Go, go, go, go!

26:46.706 --> 26:50.332
-[Cavendish grunts]
-[Dakota] All right, get in!

26:50.415 --> 26:51.914
-Did you get 'em?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:51.998 --> 26:53.373
They're right here in my hand.

26:53.457 --> 26:55.290
-There's nothing in your hand.
-Look closer.

26:55.373 --> 26:56.457
Ow!

26:58.373 --> 27:00.873
So, is this another house with a
weird shrine to Milo?

27:00.956 --> 27:02.706
It's the home of Orton Mahlson.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.290
Creator of the Dr. Zone file.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.206
He actually retired here
a few months ago

27:07.290 --> 27:08.789
and became
a bit of a recluse.

27:08.873 --> 27:13.498
Maybe, he can tell us
how Milo was in that 1965 pilot episode.

27:13.582 --> 27:18.165
Diogee Ex Machina Murphy,
you get home this instant.

27:18.248 --> 27:20.831
Hmm. That's weird,
he always goes home when you...

27:20.914 --> 27:22.831
Wait, his middle name is Ex Machina?

27:22.914 --> 27:24.831
Never mind that.

27:24.914 --> 27:27.664
The creator of your favorite show of all
time lives across town from you

27:27.748 --> 27:29.664
and this is the first time
you've ever been here?

27:29.748 --> 27:32.415
Yeah, today.

27:32.498 --> 27:35.498
I usually just stare
from behind that tree.

27:35.582 --> 27:37.831
[man] Oh, please, go away!

27:37.914 --> 27:40.706
I don't give autographs
and I don't take

27:40.789 --> 27:43.040
"shelfies" or whatever it is
you kids call them.

27:43.123 --> 27:45.165
No, Mr. Mahlson,
we aren't here for that.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.914
Of course,
if you're offering...

27:46.998 --> 27:48.748
Oh, no, no,
this is an emergency.

27:48.831 --> 27:50.081
Oh, all right!

27:51.914 --> 27:55.123
Whoa!
You look like a really old Dr. Zone.

27:56.498 --> 27:58.706
Yeah, that was totally worth
opening the door for.

27:58.789 --> 27:59.956
Thanks, kid!

28:00.040 --> 28:02.623
Sorry, I mean, I didn't know
you were the show's creator

28:02.706 --> 28:03.873
and the star!

28:03.956 --> 28:05.706
-Sara, you knew this?
-Of course.

28:05.789 --> 28:06.956
Who doesn't know that?

28:07.040 --> 28:08.540
[both] Newbies!

28:08.623 --> 28:11.248
[Dakota] Well, we escaped and
we got a free bag of clocks.

28:11.332 --> 28:12.914
Yes, but if they have
their own time machine

28:12.998 --> 28:15.914
and if they leave soon enough, they could
follow our arm trail.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.706
And you had to jinx us.

28:17.789 --> 28:19.206
They just jumped
into the time stream.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.706
If I only had my bag pack,
I have a ton of stuff

28:21.789 --> 28:23.457
that we could use to
take care of those guys.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.789
Yeah, you said, you had three
hedge trimmers, right?

28:25.873 --> 28:26.748
Oh, among other things.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.914
Why would you have
three hedge trimmers in your bag pack?

28:28.998 --> 28:32.206
In case, two of them break.
I try to pack for any eventuality.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.582
What we need to do is put
some physical distance

28:34.664 --> 28:36.706
between us and them
before we make our next jump.

28:36.789 --> 28:39.248
We gotta find a time period
where we can lose 'em.

28:39.332 --> 28:42.248
Some place chaotic,
like a parade or a great battle.

28:42.332 --> 28:43.582
We need to find some
place where we know

28:43.664 --> 28:45.332
what's going to happen
and they don't.

28:45.415 --> 28:47.748
That way,
we can navigate and get back out.

28:47.831 --> 28:50.332
Wait, I know just the time.

28:50.415 --> 28:51.415
And the place!

28:52.582 --> 28:53.873
-[tires screeching]
-[engine revving]

28:54.831 --> 28:56.165
We've got them now.

28:56.248 --> 28:57.748
Great, they followed us.

28:57.831 --> 28:59.914
Over here, you over
grown light snacks!

28:59.998 --> 29:02.123
Okay, turn left up here
by the football stadium.

29:02.206 --> 29:03.415
How does this help us?

29:03.498 --> 29:05.415
Because I've been
here before and I know...

29:05.498 --> 29:06.748
[all gasping]

29:06.831 --> 29:08.332
[Milo] Turn right up here.

29:11.831 --> 29:13.290
Hey, Pistashions.

29:13.373 --> 29:16.748
[mocking] You can't get us. You're too
busy doing photosynthesis.

29:16.831 --> 29:18.373
Go, get 'em, now!

29:19.165 --> 29:20.165
[all screaming]

29:21.040 --> 29:22.373
[all grunting]

29:24.040 --> 29:25.956
Okay, what was that?

29:26.040 --> 29:27.623
The Llama incident.
Let's go!

29:27.706 --> 29:28.956
-[engine starts]
-[engine revving]

29:31.789 --> 29:33.373
Dad, we lost them.

29:33.457 --> 29:35.956
Never mind that.
I know exactly where they're going.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.373
And we're going to get there,
before them.

29:40.956 --> 29:42.206
Get out!

29:42.290 --> 29:44.623
[growls]

29:44.706 --> 29:47.956
And then we found these two weird guys and
a bunch of our friend's pictures.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.206
-Show 'em, Melissa.
-Here!

29:50.290 --> 29:51.457
Let's seen now.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.664
Oh, Cavendish and Dakota.

29:53.748 --> 29:58.040
Yes, yes, very strange
pistachio obsessed fellows.

29:58.123 --> 30:01.956
It was them that gave me the inspiration
for Dr. Zone and Time Ape.

30:02.081 --> 30:03.998
And what about
our friend Milo?

30:04.081 --> 30:05.540
Oh, yes, of course.

30:05.623 --> 30:07.998
They had the young ward with them.

30:08.081 --> 30:10.914
Oh, and now that I think about it,
he left me something.

30:10.998 --> 30:14.373
He said that, in 50 years,
someone might ask about him.

30:14.457 --> 30:15.831
[blows]

30:15.914 --> 30:18.831
And I was to give them
this letter.

30:18.914 --> 30:21.582
All the hairs on the back
of my neck just stoop up.

30:21.664 --> 30:23.332
And I shave my neck every day!

30:23.415 --> 30:24.831
This letter could be...

30:24.914 --> 30:26.498
Wait, you shave
your neck every day?

30:26.582 --> 30:28.040
[grunts]

30:28.123 --> 30:31.206
It's from Milo,
dated 50 years ago.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.914
What does it say?
"Meet me at school with my bag pack

30:33.998 --> 30:36.664
at 3:00 p.m. on..."
Wait, that's today's date.

30:36.748 --> 30:38.914
And less than
15 minutes from now.

30:38.998 --> 30:40.914
Oh, don't forget this.
Thanks.

30:40.998 --> 30:42.748
I am not worthy!

30:43.123 --> 30:44.540
[engine starts]

30:46.457 --> 30:49.081
Oh, I hope, I haven't
told them too much.

30:49.165 --> 30:51.873
Or too little.
Oh, I don't know!

30:51.956 --> 30:54.789
"Shelfie".
Oh, I'm posting that!

30:56.998 --> 30:58.582
I think we lost them.

30:58.664 --> 31:01.040
Wait, there's something weird
with the time stream.

31:01.123 --> 31:02.248
Where are all the clocks?

31:02.332 --> 31:04.457
This must be before
the clock got put...

31:04.540 --> 31:05.956
Wait, why are you
pushing buttons?

31:06.040 --> 31:08.373
I can't seem to set
our destination time.

31:08.457 --> 31:10.873
There must be something wrong
with the terminal collector.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.540
Young man, would you take a look at the
antenna on the back of the car?

31:13.623 --> 31:15.040
Oh, sure!

31:15.123 --> 31:16.789
Let's see.
Uh-huh.

31:16.873 --> 31:18.206
Oh, yeah.
It looks like it's bent,

31:18.290 --> 31:19.706
and the gas cap
is missing, and the...

31:19.789 --> 31:22.706
Ow! There's a Pistashion
on the roof!

31:22.789 --> 31:24.040
Hang on, kid, I got you!

31:24.956 --> 31:26.081
[grunts]

31:26.165 --> 31:28.248
[screams]

31:28.332 --> 31:31.248
Hey, look at that, it was me!
Apparently, it was me.

31:31.332 --> 31:33.748
I'm the joker that put all the
clocks in the time stream.

31:33.831 --> 31:34.831
I'm a riot!

31:35.664 --> 31:36.998
All right, we should be good.

31:37.081 --> 31:38.664
[computer]
Approaching time period.

31:39.206 --> 31:41.457
Oh, it's fixed!

31:41.540 --> 31:43.914
It was me,
I was the joker.

31:43.998 --> 31:44.998
Shocking!

31:51.748 --> 31:53.248
-Well, well...
-[Melissa] We gotta go!

31:53.332 --> 31:55.582
-[Zack] No time for that!
-Time travel emergency!

31:55.664 --> 31:57.332
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

31:59.123 --> 32:01.498
You gotta stop when I put that sign up,
or all society...

32:01.582 --> 32:04.664
What the heck is that thing?

32:04.748 --> 32:07.664
A portal in the fabric
of time and space!

32:07.748 --> 32:10.873
-Probably!
-Okay, that's outside my jurisdiction.

32:13.206 --> 32:14.206
Milo?

32:15.040 --> 32:16.040
[laughs]

32:17.040 --> 32:18.873
You wish it was Milo!

32:18.956 --> 32:20.664
Jerry, we talked about this!

32:20.748 --> 32:22.332
I was gonna do the zinger.

32:22.415 --> 32:24.623
-Sorry, Dad.
-Okay!

32:24.706 --> 32:25.998
[chuckles]

32:26.081 --> 32:27.831
You wish...

32:27.914 --> 32:30.123
Yep, see?
Moment's gone! You ruined it.

32:30.206 --> 32:32.290
-Who are you?
-What are you?

32:32.373 --> 32:34.373
I am King Pistashion.

32:34.457 --> 32:37.998
And we're here to destroy you and your
time traveling friends.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.623
Well, not me, per se.

32:39.706 --> 32:41.956
These guys will destroy you.
Say hello, boys!

32:42.040 --> 32:43.123
-Hello!
-Howdy!

32:43.206 --> 32:44.956
Don't let their congenial
manner fool you.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.623
They're a lot tougher
than they look.

32:46.706 --> 32:48.040
This one ate a congressman!

32:48.165 --> 32:50.664
And this one destroyed a city
before he could walk.

32:50.748 --> 32:52.040
Here, look.
I have pictures, look.

32:52.123 --> 32:55.332
Destruction.
Destruction. Destruction.

32:55.415 --> 32:57.040
General mayhem! Here...

32:57.123 --> 32:59.998
[chuckles] Look, that's from
Jerry's surprise party!

33:00.081 --> 33:01.831
Remember that, Jerry?
We all got those...

33:01.914 --> 33:04.373
-Anything in there we can use?
-I'm looking, I'm looking.

33:04.457 --> 33:07.040
-Why does he have a soap block in here?
-I don't know!

33:07.123 --> 33:08.332
...that skate off
at the civic center.

33:08.415 --> 33:10.998
Ooh! Is that me? Aw.

33:11.081 --> 33:12.415
Look at me.

33:12.498 --> 33:14.914
Just a seedling, really.
With my whole life in front of me.

33:14.998 --> 33:16.873
Dad, they're looking for weapons.

33:16.956 --> 33:18.914
-Mulch them!
-[growling]

33:18.998 --> 33:22.831
-Zack!
-Yes, three pairs of hedge trimmers!

33:22.914 --> 33:26.664
Back, you plant monsters,
or I'll trim your...

33:26.748 --> 33:28.206
Okay, the middle fell out!

33:28.290 --> 33:31.206
So, what are the odds of all
three breaking at once?

33:31.290 --> 33:32.789
You guys,
this must mean that...

33:33.457 --> 33:34.540
[gasps]

33:34.623 --> 33:35.623
[grunts]

33:36.623 --> 33:37.956
...Milo's close.

33:39.290 --> 33:40.956
Wait, how did they
get here before us?

33:41.040 --> 33:42.206
[Melissa] Milo!

33:42.290 --> 33:46.040
Melissa, Zack,
my bag pack, Sara!

33:46.123 --> 33:47.873
[Sara] Wait,
I'm after bag pack?

33:47.956 --> 33:49.248
Here we go. Catch!

33:49.332 --> 33:50.332
[growls]

33:54.664 --> 33:55.789
Everybody, get in.

33:59.206 --> 34:01.457
-We gotta get my bag pack.
-We're gonna have to circle back, kid.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.206
-Punch it!
-I am trying!

34:03.290 --> 34:05.457
I've always wanted
to ride in a Limo.

34:05.540 --> 34:08.706
But these were not the
circumstances I was imagining.

34:08.789 --> 34:11.206
-[engine cranking]
-You're flooding it again.

34:11.290 --> 34:12.540
I'm not flooding it.

34:12.873 --> 34:13.914
[engine revving]

34:15.415 --> 34:17.248
-[all exclaiming]
-Hold on!

34:17.332 --> 34:18.582
[tires screeching]

34:20.165 --> 34:22.582
-Are you guys okay?
-Yeah! But where have you been?

34:22.664 --> 34:25.123
-[growls]
-Why are there plant monsters after us?

34:25.206 --> 34:28.081
And more importantly,
why are there plant monsters?

34:28.165 --> 34:29.498
[Dakota] Well, that's a long story.

34:29.582 --> 34:30.582
Look out!

34:31.332 --> 34:32.457
Score!

34:32.540 --> 34:33.956
Move that window
back up.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.582
Oh, where are my manners?

34:35.664 --> 34:38.081
-This is Cavendish and Dakota!
-Greetings!

34:38.165 --> 34:39.248
Hola!

34:39.332 --> 34:40.582
Oops. Run back.

34:40.664 --> 34:42.081
-[growling]
-[screaming]

34:42.165 --> 34:45.332
These guys are actual time
travelers from the future.

34:45.415 --> 34:47.206
Oh, you see that giant tree
that's about to ram us?

34:48.706 --> 34:51.165
That's King Pistashion
from the future.

34:51.248 --> 34:53.081
And that is him in our time,
right over there.

34:53.206 --> 34:54.290
[Sara] Aw. It's cute.

34:54.373 --> 34:56.123
[Milo] It's dangerous!

34:56.206 --> 34:58.206
[Zack] You sure? 'Cause that's the only
plant not trying to kill us.

34:58.290 --> 35:00.123
Oh, yeah. In the future,
he grows a huge army of these guys

35:00.206 --> 35:01.873
and they basically
take over the world.

35:01.956 --> 35:03.831
So, in order to destroy
that big plant monster,

35:03.914 --> 35:05.332
we have to destroy
the little one?

35:05.415 --> 35:07.123
-Exactly!
-[grunts]

35:07.206 --> 35:08.165
Just run it over!

35:08.248 --> 35:09.540
[tires screeching]

35:14.206 --> 35:16.123
[all screaming]

35:16.206 --> 35:18.373
-The science room!
-[Milo] Oh, watch out for the turtle!

35:21.956 --> 35:23.789
[all grunting]

35:23.873 --> 35:25.998
Oh, we're in the
girls bathroom.

35:26.081 --> 35:27.873
[Cavendish]
How do I get out of here?

35:27.956 --> 35:29.956
[Milo] Turn at the library.
No, no. The other way!

35:30.040 --> 35:31.290
All right, backing up.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.290
[all screaming]

35:35.248 --> 35:36.831
-There's the plant.
-[Dakota] Run it over.

35:36.914 --> 35:39.332
[Cavendish] That's what I'm trying to do.

35:39.415 --> 35:40.664
[grunts]

35:40.748 --> 35:41.748
[all scream]

35:43.248 --> 35:45.248
-Whoo-hoo! Dad's got 'em!
-[all cheering]

35:47.081 --> 35:49.248
-Grab hold, boys!
-[cheering]

35:51.623 --> 35:52.623
[all gasping]

35:53.914 --> 35:54.914
Come on, get out of there!

35:55.457 --> 35:56.582
[both grunt]

35:56.664 --> 35:57.748
Now, no one...

35:59.081 --> 36:00.998
...can go back
to stop us.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.248
-[engine starting]
-[pistachio] Hey, guys, look at me.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.498
I'm riding in a Limo!

36:08.498 --> 36:09.706
Oh! My turn!

36:09.789 --> 36:11.498
Boys,
leave that thing alone.

36:11.582 --> 36:12.582
You don't know
where it's been!

36:13.582 --> 36:15.332
[whispers] Check the trunk.

36:15.415 --> 36:17.540
It's just Brick and
Savannah's disguises.

36:17.623 --> 36:18.956
Wait, what's this?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.040
[Dakota] They got a rocket engine?
Infuriating.

36:20.123 --> 36:22.123
Maybe, we can use this.

36:22.206 --> 36:23.498
-[engine powering up]
-One, two...

36:23.582 --> 36:25.831
Uh, you might want to
step out of the way.

36:27.748 --> 36:28.789
My bag pack!

36:30.165 --> 36:31.165
Three.

36:43.248 --> 36:44.415
[indistinct]

36:48.498 --> 36:49.498
[panting]

36:58.123 --> 37:00.706
Oh, yeah.
That feels better.

37:00.789 --> 37:01.789
[all screaming]

37:01.873 --> 37:03.206
Milo!

37:03.290 --> 37:04.332
Ouch!

37:06.956 --> 37:08.373
[growling]

37:08.457 --> 37:10.206
Where is he?

37:10.290 --> 37:11.998
Whoo-hoo!
I'm over here!

37:13.873 --> 37:15.706
Why is he heating up
a salt block?

37:15.789 --> 37:17.789
Remember Chemistry class?
Boom!

37:19.540 --> 37:21.123
[pistachios snarling]

37:26.956 --> 37:27.998
[explosion]

37:28.081 --> 37:29.831
Yeah, take that, nutjobers!

37:34.956 --> 37:36.873
Okay, I need you guys
to operate the catapult.

37:36.956 --> 37:38.956
Oh, man. You got everything
here except the kitchen...

37:39.040 --> 37:41.081
-Sink!
-Wait, that was in your bag pack?

37:41.165 --> 37:42.498
No, I got it
over there.

37:42.582 --> 37:44.998
I think, it came from
the girl's bathroom.

37:45.081 --> 37:46.748
Release the hounds of war!

37:47.373 --> 37:49.748
[growling]

37:49.831 --> 37:52.623
If you guys can keep him busy, I'll go
after the little plant.

37:52.706 --> 37:54.831
-Piano wench and cable snares.
-Got it!

37:54.914 --> 37:57.582
-Triple extra-large straight jacket.
-Got it.

37:57.664 --> 37:58.914
Sorry, I'm running low.

37:58.998 --> 38:00.998
Wind chimes and a
self-inflating air mattress!

38:01.081 --> 38:02.582
Okay.

38:02.664 --> 38:04.664
Be creative. Just try to
keep them off of me.

38:08.248 --> 38:10.081
[both screaming]

38:10.165 --> 38:12.914
Ha, a spare!
Can you help me add this up?

38:12.998 --> 38:14.748
[grunts]
Just give me a hand!

Yes!

38:20.332 --> 38:21.332
[low growl]

38:24.582 --> 38:25.582
Uh?

38:29.623 --> 38:30.664
[grunts]

38:30.748 --> 38:32.706
Whoo-hoo!
Dad, I got one.

38:32.789 --> 38:33.748
[exclaims]
Hey.

38:34.873 --> 38:36.373
Keep going, Milo!

38:37.706 --> 38:38.706
[grunts]

38:44.040 --> 38:45.040
Huh?

38:46.706 --> 38:48.206

Ow.

-Bull's eye!

Oh, dear!

38:59.748 --> 39:00.748
[all gasping]

39:03.706 --> 39:05.498
Oops!
I wouldn't do that.

39:05.582 --> 39:07.498
And I think you friends
might agree with me.

39:07.582 --> 39:08.582
[all screaming]

39:10.789 --> 39:11.914
[screaming] No!

39:11.998 --> 39:15.081
Now, move away from
that pistachio plant, Milo!

39:17.956 --> 39:21.664
Yeah, there's nothing in that bag pack for
you, now, is there?

39:21.748 --> 39:23.831
Well, yeah,
I'm almost all tapped out.

39:23.914 --> 39:26.498
I've just got this
bird whistle.

39:26.582 --> 39:29.831
Or more specifically,
a woodpecker whistle.

39:29.914 --> 39:31.165
-[inhales]
-[whistling]

39:32.748 --> 39:33.956
[gasps] Woodpeckers!

39:35.415 --> 39:37.873
Oh, no! Oh, no!

39:41.332 --> 39:42.873
Ahhh! Woodpeckers!

39:42.956 --> 39:44.831
Shoo! Shoo!

39:44.914 --> 39:45.956
[both grunting]

39:48.165 --> 39:49.789
Oh, my back!

39:50.623 --> 39:51.956
[branch creaking]

39:52.040 --> 39:53.040
[all screaming]

39:56.290 --> 39:57.290
Oh!

39:59.165 --> 40:02.748
I've had just about enough
of you, young man.

40:02.831 --> 40:04.415
Yes, you have!

40:04.498 --> 40:06.540
Wait a minute,
why are you smiling?

40:06.623 --> 40:08.956
Because I never told
Diogee to go home.

40:13.290 --> 40:14.248
[grunts]

40:16.040 --> 40:18.914
See, I read that your particular species
of pistachio plant

40:18.998 --> 40:21.415
is extremely vulnerable
to uric acid.

40:21.498 --> 40:23.706
One of the main ingredients
of dog pee.

40:23.789 --> 40:27.081
And I happen to have
the best dog in the world.

40:27.165 --> 40:29.789
You haven't seen the last
of me, Milo Murphy.

40:29.873 --> 40:31.582
[screams]
You haven't seen the last...

40:31.664 --> 40:32.664
[grunts]

40:34.873 --> 40:36.831
[both mumbling]

40:41.332 --> 40:43.873
I regret that I have
one life to give for my...

40:46.831 --> 40:48.998
[Mr. Block] Well, if it isn't
candy pants and dumb totem.

40:49.081 --> 40:49.956
It is not.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.582
So, boss, what'd you
think of our reports?

40:52.664 --> 40:54.081
[clears throat]

40:54.165 --> 40:58.081
Not monsters, magical bag packs,
you two, and I quote,

40:58.165 --> 41:00.081
"Saving the world?"

41:00.165 --> 41:01.332
If you think that
I can't see through

41:01.415 --> 41:03.582
your absurd attempt
to get off pistachio duty,

41:03.664 --> 41:06.415
you got another thing coming.
Now, get to work!

41:06.498 --> 41:10.123
The time stream healed around him,
he'll never know what we did.

41:10.206 --> 41:11.165
[Milo] Hey, guys!

41:14.123 --> 41:16.415
I checked and
the turtle is all right.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.457
Thanks a lot, Murphy.

41:19.540 --> 41:22.540
I saved a couple clocks
from the time stream.

41:22.623 --> 41:24.165
Why don't you keep one
as a souvenir?

41:24.248 --> 41:27.290
Well, yes, I must admit,
I had my doubts about you, my boy.

41:27.373 --> 41:29.165
But you really came through for us.

41:29.248 --> 41:30.956
It was quite a day, wasn't it?

41:31.040 --> 41:32.206
I'd say.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.956
Well, children, we really
should be on our way.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.457
-Thanks, again.
-So long!

41:36.540 --> 41:37.956
[all] Good bye!

41:38.040 --> 41:39.332
[Cavendish]
I really like that kid.

41:39.415 --> 41:41.373
[Dakota] Yes, yes,
he's all right.

41:42.789 --> 41:44.123
[both gasp]

41:44.206 --> 41:46.498
[snaps fingers]
Our car?

41:46.582 --> 41:48.498
[chuckles nervously]
Oh, right...

41:48.582 --> 41:49.582
Uh, here you go.

41:50.914 --> 41:51.998
Have fun.

41:52.081 --> 41:53.998
[Cavendish]
Thanks for the loan!

41:54.081 --> 41:55.081
[car alarm beeps]

42:01.248 --> 42:03.998
Yeah, just keep pressing
the button, that'll help.

42:04.081 --> 42:07.165
So, Milo, Melissa's
got a secret room.

42:07.248 --> 42:08.706
Covered in pictures of you.

42:08.789 --> 42:10.998
-Really?
-It's not what you think.

42:11.081 --> 42:13.081
You mean, you're not cracking
Murphy's Law in the hopes

42:13.165 --> 42:16.165
of getting to the bottom of its influence
and how best to help me?

42:16.248 --> 42:18.498
Wow, I guess, it's exactly
what you think.

42:18.582 --> 42:20.998
But how did you know
where I was going to be?

42:21.081 --> 42:22.831
And when I was going to be?

42:22.914 --> 42:25.498
But whatever will we do,
Doctor?

42:26.415 --> 42:28.248
-Wow.
-Right?

42:28.332 --> 42:30.165
I'm not a very good actor.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.498
Right.

42:31.623 --> 42:35.623
You also sent us
this letter from 1965.

42:35.706 --> 42:38.457
Wait, it's my handwriting,
but I didn't write it.

42:38.540 --> 42:40.081
At least, not yet!

42:40.165 --> 42:42.706
I don't think, Milo's time
traveling days are over.

42:42.789 --> 42:44.540
So, when you do
go back there,

42:44.623 --> 42:46.623
you have to remember
to write this note

42:46.706 --> 42:48.290
and give it to
Orton Mahlson.

42:48.373 --> 42:50.081
Well, why don't you just
give him this one?

42:50.165 --> 42:51.582
It worked with peaches,
apparently.

42:51.664 --> 42:54.081
So, why do you think
you'll time travel next time?

42:54.165 --> 42:57.623
I don't know, but hopefully, it'll have
nothing to do with pistachios.

42:58.206 --> 42:59.206
[screaming]

43:06.123 --> 43:07.123
Huh?
