00:01.087 --> 00:02.835
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.879
Do you recognize that... that place?

00:04.880 --> 00:06.672
Is it on our campus?

00:06.673 --> 00:08.616
What is this about, Sarah?

00:08.617 --> 00:11.378
He had inappropriate... urges.

00:11.379 --> 00:16.032
What if all of this was built on
the cravings of a very sick man?

00:16.033 --> 00:17.974
I took the medicine last night.

00:17.975 --> 00:21.730
I was on one path and you
were on a different one.

00:26.849 --> 00:28.576
Best and final.

00:29.589 --> 00:32.113
You're accusing Stephen
Meyer of molesting you?

00:32.115 --> 00:33.765
Yeah.

00:33.766 --> 00:35.531
Cal blackmailed me.

00:35.532 --> 00:37.680
I help Eddie accept him into the fold,

00:37.681 --> 00:39.099
and he doesn't say a word.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.536
What do you want?

00:40.537 --> 00:41.833
I want what I had.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.904
I want to be out in front,
speaking for The Movement.

01:25.944 --> 01:28.279
We all know Eddie Lane's story.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.159
Okay. We're going on the road,

01:30.160 --> 01:33.249
visiting veteran centers in
Minneapolis and San Diego,

01:33.250 --> 01:36.338
and, also consecrating
a new one, in Memphis,

01:36.339 --> 01:37.815
and the apex, Philadelphia.

01:37.816 --> 01:40.118
- What do you need me to do?
- You will be

01:40.119 --> 01:41.301
the opening act,

01:41.302 --> 01:43.522
warming up the crowds for Eddie.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.023
We all know Eddie Lane's story.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.027
The struggles, the loss, doubts.

01:50.809 --> 01:52.520
Most of us can relate.

01:54.876 --> 01:56.987
Drew us to him from the very beginning.

01:56.988 --> 02:00.494
You said you wanted to speak
for The Movement, right?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.915
We both know this isn't
what I had in mind.

02:02.916 --> 02:06.046
That's what drew us to him
from the very beginning.

02:06.047 --> 02:07.800
Eddie Lane's come a long way.

02:07.801 --> 02:09.971
And now, by virtue of The Light's...

02:09.972 --> 02:13.687
grace, we get to be a part
of his every triumph.

02:13.688 --> 02:17.360
I see we're also hawking juice
and, glorified dirt now.

02:17.361 --> 02:20.659
We are helping nourish hearts
and minds from the inside out.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.448
I think you should try them.

02:22.449 --> 02:24.769
You've given up all of your
other clients for this.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.729
The Movement is the only client I need.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.136
The most devout are usually
those with the most Damage.

02:32.768 --> 02:34.154
What?

02:34.938 --> 02:37.474
Sometimes you seem...

02:39.418 --> 02:40.661
familiar.

02:44.113 --> 02:46.168
"Eddie Lane's come a long way."

02:46.169 --> 02:47.797
This is for you.

02:52.264 --> 02:54.059
Eddie Lane's come a long way.

02:54.060 --> 02:57.483
And now, by virtue of
The Light's grace...

02:57.484 --> 02:59.987
we all get to be a part of his...

02:59.988 --> 03:01.115
every triumph.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.119
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:03.947 --> 03:05.060
Eddie Lane.

03:11.637 --> 03:13.849
God, it kills me that
I'm going to miss it.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.477
You know how much it
breaks my heart that

03:15.478 --> 03:17.438
I'm not going to see you
in that play, right?

03:17.439 --> 03:18.942
I know.

03:18.943 --> 03:21.029
But Mom is going to tape it

03:21.030 --> 03:22.950
and I'm going to watch
it a hundred times.

03:22.951 --> 03:24.495
Okay?

03:24.496 --> 03:25.889
Hey, is your mom around?

03:25.890 --> 03:27.124
Yeah, hold on.

03:28.358 --> 03:30.778
Mom, Daddy wants to talk to you.

03:30.779 --> 03:32.218
You know I love you the most.

03:32.219 --> 03:34.390
- I know, I know.
- Fiercely and forever.

03:38.273 --> 03:40.384
Um, now's not really a good time.

03:40.385 --> 03:41.863
That's all right.

03:41.864 --> 03:44.535
Well, tell me more about
the play's rehearsals.

03:44.536 --> 03:46.581
Is anyone messing up on their lines?

03:46.582 --> 03:48.250
Yes. Rose is.

03:48.251 --> 03:49.496
- Are you?
- No.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.641
No?

03:50.642 --> 03:54.054
All right, okay. I know, little guy.

03:54.055 --> 03:56.956
- Almost there.
- Almost where?

03:56.957 --> 03:58.697
Could you grab his Sophie?

03:59.765 --> 04:01.767
This is never gonna end.

04:02.238 --> 04:04.952
I don't understand why you weren't
just honest with me the first time.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.687
You looked so cute in that little apron.

04:06.688 --> 04:08.147
You were so excited about
cooking me dinner,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.899
I couldn't just spit it
out, right then and there.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.048
Could you please keep it a bit quiet?

04:12.049 --> 04:14.303
- Please? Thank you.
- Sorry.

04:31.155 --> 04:32.673
- Aah!
- Right, good.

04:32.674 --> 04:34.260
Are you okay?

04:38.477 --> 04:40.021
It's not burning him.

04:40.022 --> 04:42.823
He's climbing. He's climbing.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.114
Good job! Good job.

04:45.115 --> 04:46.576
I'm in love. That's beautiful.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.903
Good getting burned.

04:47.904 --> 04:51.669
So, let's get the kinks out
of the anointment next.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.666
What do you say?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.169
Places!

04:54.611 --> 04:56.554
I want my Eddie on the
top of the stairs.

04:56.555 --> 04:59.840
Beautiful. Wind!

05:01.648 --> 05:03.735
Rain!

05:03.736 --> 05:05.446
Lightning!

05:05.447 --> 05:06.866
Aah!

05:06.867 --> 05:08.536
Eddie, it's you.

05:08.537 --> 05:09.747
I don't understand.

05:09.748 --> 05:11.087
What's happening to me?

05:11.088 --> 05:12.586
The Light chose you, Eddie.

05:12.587 --> 05:14.757
You are the chosen son.

05:14.758 --> 05:18.138
You must keep The Light
inside of everyone alive.

05:18.139 --> 05:19.820
Wait, don't go!

05:21.012 --> 05:23.273
Lead them to The Garden
when the time comes.

05:23.274 --> 05:25.152
I'll be waiting.

05:25.153 --> 05:28.325
Okay, and the light gets brighter and
brighter here, enveloping Steve,

05:28.326 --> 05:30.664
our Eddie walks downstairs,

05:30.665 --> 05:32.250
- and...
- What's going on?

05:32.251 --> 05:33.628
What's happening?

05:33.629 --> 05:35.548
- Where's Steve?
- It's Eddie.

05:35.549 --> 05:36.676
Summer?

05:36.677 --> 05:38.178
Summer, we have to go.

05:38.179 --> 05:39.682
Why? What's going on?

05:39.683 --> 05:40.976
Did something happen?

05:40.977 --> 05:42.437
I'm sorry, but she's...

05:42.438 --> 05:43.676
she's not doing the play.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.025
- She's not doing...
- What?

05:45.026 --> 05:46.263
We have to go.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.014
Now.

05:48.617 --> 05:50.000
Sarah...

05:51.582 --> 05:53.804
- I don't understand.
- Sorry, she's not doing this.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.339
Let's go.

06:00.182 --> 06:01.987
I'm rehearsing h...

06:02.645 --> 06:04.147
Put your hands down.

06:04.148 --> 06:06.401
No Christ, no Light!

06:06.402 --> 06:08.531
- No Christ, no Light!
- You're gonna burn in Hell!

06:08.532 --> 06:10.980
No Christ, no Light!

06:10.981 --> 06:12.789
No Christ, no Light!

06:12.790 --> 06:14.627
Get out of Memphis!

06:14.628 --> 06:16.964
And take your goddamn religion with you!

06:16.965 --> 06:19.762
Now, we all know Eddie Lane's story.

06:19.763 --> 06:22.859
Right? The struggles,
the loss, the doubts...

06:23.520 --> 06:25.147
Most of us can relate.

06:25.148 --> 06:27.235
It's what drew us to him
from the very beginning.

06:27.236 --> 06:29.509
That Lightinfused face
mask is really good.

06:29.510 --> 06:30.825
You should get it.

06:30.826 --> 06:33.205
And now, by virtue of The Light's grace,

06:33.206 --> 06:36.504
we get to be a part
of his every triumph.

06:36.505 --> 06:38.800
No Christ, no Light!

06:38.801 --> 06:41.054
- No Christ, no Light!
- We get to be part of...

06:41.055 --> 06:43.058
of each other's triumph.

06:43.059 --> 06:45.855
You know, because...

06:45.856 --> 06:49.237
when this... when this
community is united,

06:49.238 --> 06:52.578
nothing can stand in our way. Right?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.832
As... as pioneers

06:54.833 --> 06:57.003
of a righteous cause...

06:57.004 --> 06:59.842
because we are the righteous.

07:01.137 --> 07:03.808
We have The Light.

07:03.809 --> 07:06.146
We are The Light.

07:06.147 --> 07:07.941
Let me hear it. We are Light!

07:07.942 --> 07:10.279
We are The Light!

07:10.280 --> 07:12.116
This isn't part of the script.

07:12.117 --> 07:13.494
We are Light!

07:13.495 --> 07:14.663
They love it.

07:14.664 --> 07:16.291
And that strength...

07:16.292 --> 07:18.546
that strength is a reflection

07:18.547 --> 07:20.007
of who we follow,

07:20.008 --> 07:22.888
and who we follow is Eddie Lane!

07:36.792 --> 07:39.212
Thank you. Thank you.

07:39.213 --> 07:41.634
Um, I want to,

07:41.635 --> 07:43.596
first off, thank all of you

07:43.597 --> 07:45.892
for coming out today,

07:45.893 --> 07:47.353
and every other day,

07:47.354 --> 07:48.908
when no one's taking attendance.

07:48.909 --> 07:51.721
Your efforts are inspiring. They really,

07:52.289 --> 07:53.348
really are.

07:53.832 --> 07:57.894
Um, I'm supposed to shepherd the ones

07:58.544 --> 08:00.003
who are lost.

08:00.004 --> 08:03.343
Restore their faith.

08:03.344 --> 08:06.809
Ensure their place in The Garden.

08:08.062 --> 08:10.232
That all sounds

08:10.233 --> 08:14.240
a little crazy, right? I
mean, hey, it did to me.

08:14.241 --> 08:16.746
But I am here to tell you...

08:16.747 --> 08:18.457
That it is true.

08:20.336 --> 08:23.628
The Light... The Light chose me.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.280
To lead you.

08:26.348 --> 08:30.147
And doing so is the greatest joy

08:30.148 --> 08:31.624
of my life.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.238
I can't sit here any longer and pretend

09:00.239 --> 09:01.758
- that everything's all right.
- Mom, I explained.

09:01.759 --> 09:03.085
- Everything's not all right.
- Please.

09:03.086 --> 09:04.852
You know, I just don't
think it's right for...

09:04.853 --> 09:07.087
for kids to enact something
that they don't understand.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.697
But I do understand, Mom.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.520
Look, the play, it's not accurate.

09:10.521 --> 09:12.691
You've rewritten
everything that happened.

09:12.692 --> 09:14.695
I've done no such thing!

09:14.696 --> 09:16.030
Felicia getting burned first,

09:16.031 --> 09:17.389
Eddie's doubts,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.016
his time away from here...

09:19.017 --> 09:20.915
Okay, I may have taken
some creative liberties,

09:20.916 --> 09:22.418
but I hardly think...

09:22.419 --> 09:24.396
No, no. People are more complicated
than you're portraying them, Mom.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.732
I did the play.

09:26.970 --> 09:29.181
Seven times. It's the best part

09:29.182 --> 09:30.962
about summer. Bonding with these kids...

09:30.963 --> 09:33.189
they're a part of your community,

09:33.190 --> 09:34.473
your family...

09:34.474 --> 09:37.571
She has to complete the play
to be able to take her vows.

09:37.572 --> 09:38.701
What?

09:38.702 --> 09:40.040
- Is that true?
- Yes.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.019
Every child has to complete the story

09:42.020 --> 09:43.941
in order to take their vows at 16.

09:43.942 --> 09:45.502
Great. She can do it next year.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.862
Wait. Okay.

09:50.863 --> 09:52.896
I'm just... I'm trying to understand.

09:52.897 --> 09:57.169
Are you really concerned that she
isn't ready to handle the material?

09:57.170 --> 09:58.786
Because I've been working
with her very closely.

09:58.787 --> 10:00.662
She isn't simply saying the words.

10:00.663 --> 10:02.414
She knows their importance.
She's living them.

10:02.415 --> 10:04.544
- This is just exactly...
- And no offense, Hawk,

10:04.545 --> 10:07.174
but she's the best Steve we ever had.

10:07.175 --> 10:09.428
Mom, please, can you please just

10:09.429 --> 10:11.224
trust my instincts as a parent?

10:11.225 --> 10:13.103
But it's not fair.

10:13.104 --> 10:15.232
Honey, I know it's not fair, honey.

10:15.233 --> 10:17.904
Sometimes life isn't fair, and I'm...

10:17.905 --> 10:20.118
Listen, Summer, I'm not trying to be...

10:22.414 --> 10:25.043
- I'm not trying to hurt her.
- I don't get it.

10:25.044 --> 10:26.125
At all.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.876
I'm worried, sweetie.
Help me understand.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.779
Mom, there is nothing
to be worried about.

10:30.780 --> 10:34.353
I know you experienced something
very traumatic some months ago.

10:34.354 --> 10:37.359
Maybe the violence in the play
is servicing your Damage,

10:37.360 --> 10:38.821
and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

10:38.822 --> 10:40.783
No, it has nothing to do with that.

10:40.784 --> 10:42.393
Then what is it, Mom? What's going on?

10:42.394 --> 10:43.455
Please, what the hell is...

10:43.456 --> 10:45.728
I don't want her idolizing Steve!

10:50.513 --> 10:52.218
I don't want her idolizing anyone.

10:56.528 --> 10:57.947
We're done here.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.304
Hey, Cal, can I borrow you a minute?

11:33.305 --> 11:34.485
Yeah.

11:35.226 --> 11:37.772
Um, listen...

11:37.773 --> 11:39.734
I know that this may be

11:39.735 --> 11:42.406
a humbling experience for you...

11:42.407 --> 11:45.575
No, no, it's, glad to be of help.

11:45.576 --> 11:47.249
Any way you see fit.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.857
That's good, and I...

11:48.858 --> 11:51.884
I appreciate that, but this tour

11:51.885 --> 11:54.388
is just a little different than what you

11:54.389 --> 11:55.960
are used to, so there's...

11:55.961 --> 11:57.896
no, there's no need for...

11:57.897 --> 11:59.469
for grandstanding.

12:00.318 --> 12:01.554
I'm not following.

12:02.363 --> 12:05.035
"The righteous cause?"

12:05.558 --> 12:06.580
The callandresponse?

12:06.581 --> 12:09.628
This isn't a fascist rally.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.297
I know, I just thought
that people needed

12:11.298 --> 12:14.261
a little, buoying after
braving protesters and...

12:14.262 --> 12:16.600
Yeah, no, II see that,

12:16.601 --> 12:18.269
but, um...

12:18.270 --> 12:19.778
that's just not how we do things now,

12:19.779 --> 12:22.384
so ease up, you know.

12:22.385 --> 12:23.404
Stay on book.

12:23.405 --> 12:26.036
- Sure thing.
- All right.

12:29.544 --> 12:31.871
- Shall we get our room?
- What, we get our own?

12:31.872 --> 12:34.009
We don't have to sleep at Eddie's feet?

12:34.010 --> 12:36.681
You know, you killed it in there.
He should be thanking you.

12:37.518 --> 12:40.147
I'm going to take a walk.

12:45.408 --> 12:47.035
Thank you.

12:47.036 --> 12:48.998
Hey. Got your room key.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.085
The old traditional kind.

12:51.086 --> 12:52.421
36, it's upstairs.

12:52.422 --> 12:54.883
Great. Thank you.

12:56.096 --> 12:57.510
You okay?

12:58.309 --> 12:59.853
Yeah.

12:59.854 --> 13:01.523
Yeah.

13:01.524 --> 13:06.073
Listen, I know this tour wasn't the
best timing for you, familywise,

13:06.074 --> 13:08.161
you know, with your daughter's play.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.415
Yeah, well, what can you do?

13:10.416 --> 13:12.002
You know?

13:12.003 --> 13:13.756
Yeah, Cal... Cal was great.

13:13.757 --> 13:17.179
- He was... he was good.
- Yeah, Cal. You know.

13:17.180 --> 13:20.060
It's not going to happen
again. He was just...

13:20.061 --> 13:21.350
a little over the top.

13:21.351 --> 13:23.817
I had a talk with him.
It's gonna be fine.

13:23.818 --> 13:25.571
Okay. You know, best to get the kinks

13:25.572 --> 13:27.032
out of the way before Philadelphia.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.368
We want the message to be yours.

13:28.369 --> 13:30.752
Hey, um...

13:32.460 --> 13:34.088
thank you, for...

13:34.732 --> 13:37.553
keeping me sane through all of this,

13:37.554 --> 13:40.225
or at least trying to.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.398
Really appreciate it.

13:44.777 --> 13:47.322
It's your mom.

13:47.323 --> 13:49.034
Don't want to ignore mom.

13:49.035 --> 13:51.080
Hey, thank you.

13:58.555 --> 14:00.140
This is Vera Stephens.

14:00.141 --> 14:01.935
Leave a message, and
I'll return your call.

14:03.313 --> 14:04.899
Everything okay?

14:04.900 --> 14:06.236
Yeah.

14:09.033 --> 14:12.418
You're still seeing spots, shadows.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.507
It's time. We tried it
your way, but now...

14:16.508 --> 14:18.635
I can't even be in a doctor's office.

14:18.636 --> 14:20.096
There's no way I'm having surgery.

14:20.097 --> 14:22.225
If we don't remove the eye,

14:22.226 --> 14:24.062
the melanoma will spread,

14:24.063 --> 14:25.901
and it will kill you.

14:28.531 --> 14:30.411
Have you talked to Vera?

14:31.161 --> 14:32.789
She'll talk some sense into you.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.194
She's not here.

14:34.195 --> 14:36.212
She's on the road with the son,

14:36.213 --> 14:37.777
spreading the word.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.655
You haven't told her.

14:42.643 --> 14:44.492
We can't afford distractions.

14:45.439 --> 14:46.886
Please know that

14:47.945 --> 14:50.031
we are beholden to you

14:50.032 --> 14:51.849
and to her for all you do.

14:53.205 --> 14:54.769
You won't go through this alone.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.046
We will be there.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.690
I will be there.

15:00.219 --> 15:01.718
As much as you'll let me.

15:05.689 --> 15:08.883
We need you with us on
the other side of this.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.825
We can't start over without you.

15:25.562 --> 15:27.439
Come on.

15:29.235 --> 15:30.821
I can get that.

15:30.822 --> 15:32.407
- Hey, um, it's...
- Used to stock

15:32.408 --> 15:34.829
these old fossils

15:34.830 --> 15:37.543
for a while.

15:37.544 --> 15:39.339
- Yeah.
- You got to hit 'em

15:40.341 --> 15:41.691
just right.

15:45.769 --> 15:48.857
Well, well, well. Um, thank you.

15:48.858 --> 15:50.026
Very much.

15:50.027 --> 15:51.571
I appreciate it, my friend.

15:51.572 --> 15:53.744
So, I saw you speak back in Memphis.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.539
What you said about The Light.

15:58.001 --> 15:59.442
It really got to me.

16:01.509 --> 16:02.969
That's good to hear.

16:02.970 --> 16:04.589
I wanted to tell you so, but...

16:05.265 --> 16:07.717
y'all cut out before I had the chance.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.761
Eddie Lane.

16:11.389 --> 16:12.681
Daniel Givens.

16:13.081 --> 16:14.415
Nice to meet you, Daniel.

16:15.285 --> 16:17.460
So, what brought
you to the new center?

16:18.960 --> 16:21.047
It's my kid, actually.

16:24.387 --> 16:26.010
She's not doing so great.

16:27.018 --> 16:29.062
I want to make it all better for her

16:29.063 --> 16:30.640
all the time, but...

16:31.974 --> 16:34.435
I can't seem to be able
to do anything right.

16:36.022 --> 16:37.872
I got two myself.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.917
I know the territory.

16:39.918 --> 16:41.836
Her mom left us.

16:41.837 --> 16:43.467
She woke up one morning,

16:43.468 --> 16:45.053
said she couldn't stay, had to go,

16:45.054 --> 16:46.781
had to live her life.

16:48.185 --> 16:50.361
Turned around and never looked back.

16:51.824 --> 16:54.989
Poor kid just couldn't get over it.

16:56.952 --> 16:58.251
That's terrible.

16:58.956 --> 17:00.793
I'm really sorry to hear about...

17:00.794 --> 17:03.799
God, you know, I hate...
I hate to do this to you,

17:03.800 --> 17:06.136
Daniel, right now, but
I got to take this.

17:06.137 --> 17:07.973
You know, I can get
someone to talk to you.

17:07.973 --> 17:09.810
If you'd just talk to my little girl,

17:09.811 --> 17:11.355
- I think it'd do a lot of good.
- I would like to

17:11.356 --> 17:12.983
do that, but in the meantime,

17:12.983 --> 17:15.113
Sharon would love to help you. Okay?

17:15.114 --> 17:17.701
Hopefully, you and I will
run into each other again.

17:17.702 --> 17:19.162
All right?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.667
Hi. Sharon Walker.

17:21.669 --> 17:23.251
I'd love to sit down with you.

17:24.508 --> 17:25.627
I'll wait.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.655
Well, he might be a while.

17:27.656 --> 17:28.729
Come on.

17:29.451 --> 17:31.353
We're all family here.

17:31.354 --> 17:32.815
I'll bet you are.

17:32.816 --> 17:34.401
It doesn't make any sense.

17:34.402 --> 17:36.781
She's... she's not
engaging with us at all.

17:36.782 --> 17:38.952
Just put your mom on the phone.

17:38.953 --> 17:41.165
Hey. What's going on?

17:41.166 --> 17:42.793
Something else is going on.

17:42.794 --> 17:44.421
Completely unreasonable.

17:44.422 --> 17:47.093
Hawk, just hand her the phone, please.

17:47.094 --> 17:48.653
Eddie asked me to help.

17:49.594 --> 17:51.143
Okay, well, what can we do for you?

17:51.144 --> 17:52.479
No, I don't... no, no, no, no.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.941
- I'm... I'm fine.
- What...?

17:56.029 --> 17:57.535
Dad wants to talk to you.

17:58.659 --> 18:00.203
Maybe we can... we can help you.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.040
No... no, if... No, I'm fine.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.793
I see you're... you're uncomfortable.

18:03.794 --> 18:05.296
- Just let us talk to you...
- No, it's all right.

18:05.297 --> 18:07.008
Sir, all we want to do is...

18:07.009 --> 18:08.803
I don't want your help!

18:08.804 --> 18:10.390
Okay, okay.

18:16.110 --> 18:18.490
It's okay.

18:24.252 --> 18:27.982
Hey, I guess Hawk's
gotten you up to speed.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.056
Not in any way that explains

18:31.057 --> 18:32.935
why you would pull Summer

18:32.936 --> 18:34.730
from The Awakening.

18:34.731 --> 18:36.567
You know, the play is
supposed to be our story,

18:36.568 --> 18:38.905
our truth, but it's never
really been that, has it?

18:38.906 --> 18:41.036
It's taken me a while
to figure that out.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.679
The whole thing's a
farce, and I don't want

18:42.680 --> 18:44.291
- our daughter to...
- Wait, wait, wait.

18:44.292 --> 18:45.752
Is that what you believe?

18:45.753 --> 18:47.192
That the play is a joke,

18:47.193 --> 18:48.842
- that all of this is... what?
- No, of course not.

18:48.843 --> 18:50.595
It's not... it's not a joke.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.599
You know what? It doesn't...
it doesn't matter.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.227
Of course it matters
what you think, Sarah.

18:54.228 --> 18:55.897
It matters to me. What is it?

18:55.898 --> 18:57.237
You know, if you want to have a say

18:57.238 --> 18:58.903
in our daughter's
extracurricular activities,

18:58.904 --> 19:00.203
then you should come home.

19:00.204 --> 19:02.786
My... I would love nothing more,

19:02.787 --> 19:04.999
and you know that. But this isn't

19:05.000 --> 19:07.563
an extracurricular activity, Sarah.

19:09.050 --> 19:11.290
You know what? I'm not going
to go another round tonight.

19:12.076 --> 19:13.693
If you want a say, come home.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.520
Look, I don't know

19:15.521 --> 19:16.821
what the hell is going on with you,

19:16.822 --> 19:18.693
and obviously, you're
not going to tell me,

19:18.694 --> 19:21.848
but how dare you pull Summer into it?

19:21.849 --> 19:24.120
Put her back in the fucking play.

19:27.629 --> 19:29.632
No.

19:29.633 --> 19:31.552
Sarah...

19:36.480 --> 19:38.942
Yeah? Okay, we'll take those.

19:38.943 --> 19:40.780
Right?

19:44.704 --> 19:47.793
That's not in your future.

19:47.794 --> 19:50.799
Take it off.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.469
How about this?

19:53.722 --> 19:55.003
Well, you'll grow into it.

19:55.004 --> 19:56.427
You know, we deserve some treats,

19:56.428 --> 19:58.565
putting up with all that crazy, right?

19:58.566 --> 20:00.443
Right?

20:00.444 --> 20:02.268
Okay, we'll take these...

20:03.503 --> 20:06.080
and that.

20:08.502 --> 20:10.379
There you go.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.175
Okay.

20:15.182 --> 20:16.757
Dad...

20:16.758 --> 20:19.648
Hello, baby girl.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.717
Hey.

20:33.718 --> 20:35.262
- Hey.
- We've been looking for you.

20:35.263 --> 20:37.308
Um, yeah, I just...

20:37.309 --> 20:39.855
want some, um, alone time.

20:39.856 --> 20:41.484
What's going on?

20:41.485 --> 20:44.823
I have these new photo
ops to run by you.

20:44.824 --> 20:47.161
Nothing too timeconsuming,

20:47.162 --> 20:49.750
or, um, requiring a massive detour,

20:49.751 --> 20:51.834
so don't worry about it.

20:54.134 --> 20:55.596
I've lost Eddie.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.745
Sorry.

20:58.746 --> 21:00.437
It's just,

21:00.438 --> 21:01.869
family stuff.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.157
Do you want to talk about it?

21:07.787 --> 21:09.999
No, not really.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I just...

21:12.087 --> 21:13.967
God, I'm so frustrated.

21:15.426 --> 21:17.715
My wife... ex...

21:18.527 --> 21:20.895
Sarah is going through
something right now,

21:20.896 --> 21:23.432
and I just don't know what to do,

21:23.433 --> 21:26.060
and it's affecting our
kids, and...

21:28.139 --> 21:29.622
If you want to go home,

21:29.623 --> 21:32.024
then it'll be fine.

21:33.305 --> 21:34.438
How?

21:35.398 --> 21:37.929
What, just cancel the tour,
cancel Philadelphia?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.223
No, no, no, no.

21:39.224 --> 21:41.144
You don't have to...

21:41.145 --> 21:43.719
well, not... not entirely.

21:44.401 --> 21:47.281
We'll have Cal do it.

21:47.282 --> 21:48.743
He would love that.

21:48.744 --> 21:50.266
Get behind the wheel.

21:50.267 --> 21:54.212
Eddie, Eddie, I'll make
sure he stays on message.

21:54.213 --> 21:55.422
Look,

21:55.423 --> 21:57.385
people will be disappointed,

21:57.386 --> 21:59.222
but Cal will give a good speech,

21:59.223 --> 22:00.684
and they'll have a good time,

22:00.685 --> 22:02.353
and he'll never be you.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.315
Look, if I bail,

22:04.316 --> 22:06.361
there's gonna be something else.

22:06.362 --> 22:08.323
There's always something else.

22:08.324 --> 22:12.338
Someone else, you know,
someone will get let down.

22:12.339 --> 22:14.878
Yeah. I guess

22:14.879 --> 22:18.511
you have to choose who you
want to let down, then.

22:18.512 --> 22:19.596
Okay.

22:19.597 --> 22:21.517
Whatever you decide,

22:21.518 --> 22:23.479
we'll... we'll make do with it.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.318
Okay. Just let me know.

22:34.334 --> 22:36.184
But why didn't you tell me
when you first saw him?

22:36.185 --> 22:38.506
- I could've easily...
- Because I wasn't sure if he was real,

22:38.507 --> 22:39.991
and I kept hoping that he wasn't

22:39.992 --> 22:42.559
and that I was just losing it
because I've been so tired.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.187
But why are you meeting with him?

22:44.188 --> 22:46.065
Like, what are you hoping
to gain from this?

22:46.066 --> 22:48.028
He won't stop following
me until I hear him out.

22:48.029 --> 22:49.990
You know, if you don't want
to come, you don't have to.

22:49.991 --> 22:51.535
No, I just... I don't
want to see you get hurt.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.164
I won't.

22:55.376 --> 22:57.672
This is a chance for my dad to see me,

22:57.673 --> 23:00.005
really see me.

23:00.919 --> 23:04.160
Sober, with Forest, doing so well.

23:06.106 --> 23:09.988
And... what if it doesn't
go the way you plan?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.159
Well, um...

23:12.160 --> 23:13.747
I guess I'm used to it.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.505
Nothing goes as planned with you, Cal.

23:22.013 --> 23:24.392
It's gonna take time.

23:24.393 --> 23:26.730
Yeah, there is no plan, is there?

23:26.731 --> 23:28.901
You could try having a little faith.

23:28.902 --> 23:31.406
I believe in you, baby.

23:32.251 --> 23:35.122
I mean, I loved watching
Eddie Embrace our son,

23:35.123 --> 23:37.334
and II love watching you

23:37.335 --> 23:39.338
fluff him out there every night.

23:39.339 --> 23:43.556
I've always been here for you.

23:46.270 --> 23:48.900
I'm just... now, I'm not sure
if you're trying to convince me

23:48.901 --> 23:51.029
that things will be
different, or yourself.

23:56.612 --> 23:59.063
- Mom must be so pissed.
- Doesn't matter.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.524
You know, when I was a kid,

24:04.818 --> 24:06.518
the play meant everything to me.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.564
I knew every single word of it,

24:08.565 --> 24:09.664
and now Summer does,

24:09.665 --> 24:12.826
and she's being taught
to revere a man that...

24:13.240 --> 24:14.687
Might have made the whole thing up?

24:15.286 --> 24:17.289
Yeah.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.795
Sarah? Are you having doubts?

24:19.796 --> 24:22.169
You know, maybe you were the lucky one.

24:23.344 --> 24:25.890
- Leaving when you did?
- No.

24:25.891 --> 24:27.390
I gave up a lot when I left.

24:27.391 --> 24:29.690
I'm still paying for it.
II am never going to have

24:29.691 --> 24:31.067
a real relationship with my mom,

24:31.068 --> 24:32.654
and my children barely even know

24:32.655 --> 24:34.181
what their grandmother looks like.

24:35.201 --> 24:37.204
All I'm saying, Sarah,
is just be careful.

24:37.205 --> 24:40.293
You know, this isn't something
you can just walk away from.

24:40.294 --> 24:42.339
You can't just undo this.

24:44.052 --> 24:45.345
I know.

24:45.346 --> 24:47.057
Look, we made our choices,

24:47.058 --> 24:48.351
and our children, they're
just going to have to

24:48.352 --> 24:50.940
figure it out for themselves.

24:50.941 --> 24:52.510
Trying to force a child's hand

24:52.511 --> 24:54.785
never really seems to work out
the way you want, anyway.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.327
Just ask Mom and Dad.

25:00.376 --> 25:01.690
Yep.

25:01.691 --> 25:03.883
With my Eye, I see you anew.

25:04.528 --> 25:05.795
I do too.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.238
No, babe, that's not right.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.965
You're supposed to repeat what I said.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.075
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.510
Just... okay.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.613
May I?

25:15.949 --> 25:18.500
Okay. Here.

25:19.749 --> 25:22.002
And right here.

25:22.003 --> 25:23.923
Okay? Now you're ready

25:23.924 --> 25:25.468
to be clean in each other's Eyes.

25:25.469 --> 25:27.012
- Thank you.
- Actually,

25:27.013 --> 25:28.431
um, can I ask you something?

25:28.432 --> 25:29.567
Yeah.

25:30.519 --> 25:32.356
Once we do this,

25:32.357 --> 25:34.360
the Damage we've caused each other

25:34.361 --> 25:35.822
is gone, right?

25:35.823 --> 25:37.282
Well, not quite that simple.

25:37.283 --> 25:39.370
This isn't a cureall for issues

25:39.371 --> 25:40.706
you're having in your relationship,

25:40.707 --> 25:43.002
but setting your intentions,

25:43.003 --> 25:44.923
here, now, together,

25:44.924 --> 25:46.043
it's a start.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.881
Right? Okay.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.104
All right.

25:52.105 --> 25:54.651
Hey, Cal. What are you doing?

25:54.652 --> 25:55.903
I'm heading out to find Mary.

25:55.904 --> 25:57.665
No, I mean with them.

25:59.173 --> 26:01.210
And stepping in last night.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.546
I asked Sharon to help with that man,

26:04.964 --> 26:06.382
not you.

26:06.383 --> 26:07.719
Right. Well, respectfully,

26:07.720 --> 26:08.903
that man could not be helped.

26:08.904 --> 26:10.443
Everybody can be helped.

26:10.444 --> 26:13.404
You know, Eddie, I am 10R.

26:13.405 --> 26:17.698
We made a deal about how
you would come back.

26:26.559 --> 26:27.585
Hey.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.692
Look, I will stay for Philadelphia,

26:29.693 --> 26:31.090
but Cal's off the program.

26:31.768 --> 26:34.189
You gotta find something
else for him to do there.

26:42.998 --> 26:44.645
I don't mean to bother you.

26:45.294 --> 26:46.630
No, hey, look,

26:46.631 --> 26:48.509
I'm sorry about last night.

26:48.510 --> 26:50.220
My... my son called,

26:50.221 --> 26:52.060
and I just...

26:52.061 --> 26:54.688
I really didn't mean to disappoint you.

26:54.689 --> 26:55.948
So...

26:56.849 --> 26:58.100
let's talk about your daughter.

26:58.613 --> 26:59.614
How's she doing?

26:59.615 --> 27:01.036
Not good.

27:02.716 --> 27:03.747
Would you help?

27:04.331 --> 27:05.331
Yes.

27:05.858 --> 27:06.858
Of course.

27:07.776 --> 27:08.933
I would love to try.

27:14.979 --> 27:16.355
Does now work?

27:16.356 --> 27:18.026
Sure.

28:01.102 --> 28:02.657
I'm sorry I pulled you out of the play.

28:02.658 --> 28:04.016
It was the wrong thing to do.

28:04.994 --> 28:06.164
It's okay, Mom.

28:08.247 --> 28:10.714
It was just that I never questioned

28:10.715 --> 28:12.384
as a kid, you know,

28:12.385 --> 28:14.221
anything that my mom and
dad ever said or did,

28:14.222 --> 28:15.580
and it wasn't always the best way to be,

28:15.581 --> 28:16.819
so I'm glad you stood up to me

28:16.820 --> 28:18.487
because it made me think
and it made me know

28:18.488 --> 28:20.264
that you're gonna be a grownup one day

28:20.265 --> 28:22.177
and you're gonna have your own
thoughts and your opinions,

28:22.178 --> 28:23.869
and so I'm really proud of you for that.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.042
I know some of it didn't happen

28:29.043 --> 28:32.044
exactly the way Grandma's
got us doing it,

28:33.003 --> 28:35.656
but what's important is true.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.944
- It's beautiful out here.
- Thanks.

29:56.269 --> 29:57.470
Is your daughter home?

29:57.471 --> 29:58.947
Should be, real soon.

30:00.267 --> 30:03.147
I've been fixing to get the
air in that truck looked at.

30:03.148 --> 30:04.232
No...

30:09.327 --> 30:10.892
Where are my manners?

30:11.830 --> 30:14.563
Can I get you some water, or juice?

30:15.047 --> 30:16.412
Yeah, whatever you,

30:16.413 --> 30:18.353
you got would be great. Thank you.

30:38.511 --> 30:40.931
Surprised she let me take that.

30:42.569 --> 30:44.051
That's my Chelsey.

30:45.149 --> 30:47.333
Usually always running around,

30:47.334 --> 30:49.389
or holed up in her room.

30:50.535 --> 30:53.038
Too busy to spend much
time with me, either way.

30:53.039 --> 30:54.500
Yeah.

30:54.501 --> 30:56.463
I get that. That's the way my...

30:56.464 --> 30:58.390
my boy is, and I fear my...

30:59.135 --> 31:01.138
my daughter's gonna be hitting that...

31:01.139 --> 31:02.361
that phase very soon.

31:12.244 --> 31:13.705
Um...

31:13.706 --> 31:15.039
is there a restroom I could use?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.671
Up the steps, to your left.

31:17.672 --> 31:19.634
Great.

31:19.635 --> 31:21.514
Thank you.

31:46.396 --> 31:48.023
Please don't touch that.

31:48.024 --> 31:50.111
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

31:50.112 --> 31:52.365
All right.

31:52.366 --> 31:54.056
It's just as she left it.

31:59.631 --> 32:02.254
I suppose there's no use
in keeping this up.

32:03.775 --> 32:06.508
See, my girl's been gone 12 years now.

32:08.524 --> 32:09.817
Okay.

32:09.818 --> 32:11.320
You mean...

32:11.321 --> 32:13.056
She left wanting to do some good.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.623
She met a man who
promised her everything,

32:16.624 --> 32:18.645
and wound up taking it all away.

32:19.379 --> 32:21.022
- Um...
- He took her away from me.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.929
Convinced her the...

32:23.930 --> 32:26.582
sun, moon, "Light,"

32:27.418 --> 32:28.855
whatever the hell it was,

32:28.856 --> 32:29.990
was talking to him,

32:30.479 --> 32:32.799
and it said they needed
to kill themselves,

32:32.800 --> 32:34.034
'cause the quicker they did,

32:34.035 --> 32:36.411
the quicker they'd get to
some fuckin' wonderland.

32:36.412 --> 32:39.209
Daniel, hey, I didn't
hurt your daughter, okay?

32:41.757 --> 32:43.210
I know that.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.005
I do.

32:48.186 --> 32:49.617
What did you do to me?

32:49.618 --> 32:52.569
I can't let you hurt someone else's kid.

32:52.570 --> 32:55.742
Makin' 'em think some
Light talks to you.

33:09.103 --> 33:11.524
May not've had that cyanide,

33:11.525 --> 33:14.613
but we make do around here.

33:27.389 --> 33:29.799
You know, I didn't mean
to scare you yesterday.

33:30.855 --> 33:32.483
I read about your Meyerism tour

33:32.484 --> 33:33.651
a while ago, and I...

33:33.652 --> 33:35.055
I just didn't want to...

33:35.782 --> 33:38.243
I didn't know how you'd feel
about me just turning up...

33:41.167 --> 33:43.212
Hey, you sure that boy isn't hungry?

33:43.213 --> 33:44.251
Yeah, he's fine.

33:45.008 --> 33:46.928
Our nurse, Shelby, actually says

33:46.929 --> 33:49.165
that he's overachieving on every level.

33:50.184 --> 33:51.947
Yeah, 90th percentile and all that.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.616
And you?

33:55.488 --> 33:56.701
Good.

33:57.144 --> 34:00.355
Sober. Happy. Totally happy.

34:02.043 --> 34:04.547
Are you still living on that field?

34:04.548 --> 34:06.195
The compound? No.

34:06.196 --> 34:08.679
We actually got a great
apartment in the city.

34:08.681 --> 34:09.922
Cal and I.

34:10.935 --> 34:13.105
And he didn't feel like
coming today?

34:13.106 --> 34:14.342
Cal?

34:14.344 --> 34:16.110
Well, he's a very busy man.

34:17.991 --> 34:19.827
And last time I saw him,

34:19.828 --> 34:21.393
he threatened to kill me.

34:22.123 --> 34:23.728
You think that he'd might wanna

34:23.728 --> 34:25.547
make peace with his fatherinlaw.

34:33.764 --> 34:35.239
You are married, aren't you?

34:35.960 --> 34:38.601
In every way that matters, yeah.

34:39.973 --> 34:42.998
Mary, you don't want
that kid growing up

34:42.998 --> 34:45.293
without the consecration
of man and wife.

34:45.295 --> 34:47.400
Since when did you give
a shit about that?

34:47.926 --> 34:50.431
Since I spent some time in jail.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.563
Yeah, I know, it was a
minor offense, and I...

34:54.563 --> 34:56.315
was blown way out of proportion,

34:56.317 --> 34:57.482
but I'm glad it happened,

34:57.483 --> 34:59.253
because I got straight in there.

35:00.339 --> 35:01.568
Thanks to the Lord, and...

35:01.569 --> 35:03.810
Okay.

35:04.124 --> 35:05.585
He really helped me.

35:05.586 --> 35:07.421
He helped me see things clearer,

35:07.422 --> 35:09.217
helped me see things right,

35:09.218 --> 35:11.234
and I know... I know
what you're thinking.

35:12.391 --> 35:14.853
I would be skeptical myself,

35:14.854 --> 35:17.024
but thanks to the grace of the Lord,

35:17.025 --> 35:19.780
I really have found peace,

35:19.781 --> 35:22.034
and love,

35:22.035 --> 35:24.665
and forgiveness.

35:26.503 --> 35:28.798
And Mary, I am praying
for you every day.

35:28.799 --> 35:30.552
I am praying for your soul,

35:30.553 --> 35:32.327
and for Cal's, and for this baby's,

35:32.328 --> 35:34.534
that you find the Lord too,

35:35.309 --> 35:37.273
that you embrace him with all of your...

35:37.274 --> 35:39.486
I don't need your fucking prayers.

35:39.487 --> 35:41.574
Okay? 'Cause I am whole,

35:41.575 --> 35:43.410
and I am complete,

35:43.411 --> 35:45.540
and you are a horrible,

35:45.541 --> 35:48.253
awful, piece of shit

35:48.254 --> 35:50.215
who deserves to rot...

35:50.216 --> 35:51.719
- Baby, girl...
- Don't call me that.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.109
Okay? Ever.

35:54.768 --> 35:56.596
I'll never see you again.

35:58.149 --> 35:59.683
And I'll forget you.

36:03.117 --> 36:06.231
And I know that you won't forget me.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.473
Okay, guys, change of plans.

36:35.474 --> 36:37.226
We're gonna rest here another night

36:37.227 --> 36:38.987
and set out first thing
in the morning, okay?

36:40.233 --> 36:43.014
Do me a favor. Just tell
the others as well.

36:44.241 --> 36:46.441
Mom? Is something happening?

36:46.442 --> 36:48.749
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean?

36:48.750 --> 36:50.462
Could it be happening?

36:50.463 --> 36:52.448
Eddie disappeared five hours ago,

36:52.449 --> 36:55.254
and it's just not like him to
go anywhere without telling me.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.932
I'm... I'm trying to keep everyone calm,

36:56.933 --> 36:58.101
- but I just...
- Okay.

36:58.102 --> 36:59.855
No.

36:59.856 --> 37:02.276
It... it can't happen yet.

37:02.277 --> 37:03.571
We're not ready.

37:03.572 --> 37:05.157
You don't think...

37:05.158 --> 37:06.865
There were these protesters yesterday

37:06.866 --> 37:08.664
and... shit, if
something's happened to him,

37:08.665 --> 37:10.071
I don't know what to do.

37:10.072 --> 37:11.327
Hey, gotta call you back.

37:11.328 --> 37:13.591
No, Vera, don't...

37:13.592 --> 37:15.135
Mary, Mary. Where's Cal?

37:15.136 --> 37:16.639
- Here, isn't he?
- No.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.234
Eddie's disappeared. No one's seen him

37:18.235 --> 37:20.276
for the last couple of hours.
He's not answering his phone.

37:20.277 --> 37:21.815
Cal's not answering his phone.

37:21.816 --> 37:24.115
The last I saw them, they were
together. I'll try Cal again.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.618
- Don't you want to call the cops?
- No, absolutely not.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.328
They can't do anything for 24 hours,

37:28.329 --> 37:29.621
and they're only gonna harass us

37:29.622 --> 37:30.706
about who we are and what we...

37:30.707 --> 37:32.712
Could you please get
the baby to be quiet?

37:34.132 --> 37:36.379
- I know, I know.
- Come on, Cal.

37:37.530 --> 37:39.183
Fuck. Fuck.

37:39.184 --> 37:40.425
What?

37:41.438 --> 37:43.678
Um, I left his diaper bag.

38:17.218 --> 38:18.888
What the f...

38:33.919 --> 38:37.257
Hey! Hey!

38:37.258 --> 38:38.844
Daniel!

38:38.845 --> 38:41.349
Hey!

39:29.321 --> 39:32.159
Oof!

40:10.654 --> 40:13.202
Please, call back, call back, call back.

40:14.545 --> 40:15.663
The Light...

40:15.664 --> 40:17.584
Hear my call, please, please,

40:17.585 --> 40:19.589
I need your strength...

40:32.907 --> 40:34.619
Our Father...

40:37.206 --> 40:38.918
Hallowed be thy name.

40:38.919 --> 40:41.047
Thy Kingdom come,

41:03.342 --> 41:05.513
Hey! Hey!

41:05.514 --> 41:08.477
Daniel! Hey!

41:08.478 --> 41:11.065
Hey!

41:11.066 --> 41:13.069
Help!

41:34.237 --> 41:35.656
Eddie, Eddie, no, no.

41:35.657 --> 41:37.954
Wait, wait, wait. Eddie, Eddie.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.708
Eddie, no, no, no! Eddie, Eddie!

41:40.709 --> 41:41.918
No, no, don't...

41:41.919 --> 41:43.197
Don't, don't.

41:50.545 --> 41:51.654
Fuck!

42:20.872 --> 42:22.273
I shouldn't have gone.

42:23.670 --> 42:25.109
To my dad.

42:26.798 --> 42:28.321
So stupid.

42:28.998 --> 42:30.047
Shh.

42:31.198 --> 42:32.478
It's okay.

42:32.479 --> 42:34.462
No, it's not. I, um...

42:36.252 --> 42:38.907
I left the diaper bag in the diner.

42:38.908 --> 42:40.767
I think my dad took it.

42:41.376 --> 42:42.874
We'll get another diaper bag.

42:42.875 --> 42:45.044
Had his stuff, like his Sophie.

42:45.045 --> 42:46.856
No.

42:48.257 --> 42:49.717
We'll get a new one.

43:00.326 --> 43:01.896
Why'd you save him?

43:14.425 --> 43:16.077
I didn't do it for him.

43:20.659 --> 43:22.250
But he owes me now.

43:24.875 --> 43:26.084
He owes me.

43:26.963 --> 43:28.397
He owes us.

43:28.967 --> 43:30.358
Everything.

43:36.147 --> 43:37.440
Who we are is

43:37.441 --> 43:39.236
who we follow,

43:39.237 --> 43:41.240
and who we follow

43:41.241 --> 43:42.868
is Eddie Lane.

43:42.869 --> 43:45.331
Speaking for him today,

43:45.332 --> 43:47.377
for your Movement,

43:47.378 --> 43:48.880
is Cal Roberts.

43:48.881 --> 43:50.920
Please help me welcome him.

43:59.068 --> 44:00.487
Thank you.

44:02.199 --> 44:05.539
I am so proud to be here today,

44:05.540 --> 44:07.083
speaking for Eddie,

44:07.084 --> 44:09.729
and, and for myself, also.

44:09.730 --> 44:13.680
We believe that every soul

44:13.681 --> 44:16.143
can be saved,

44:16.144 --> 44:17.938
from suffering,

44:18.480 --> 44:19.771
from pain,

44:20.528 --> 44:21.920
and we believe...

44:22.448 --> 44:24.412
The ninth rung should be Protector.

44:25.246 --> 44:26.790
A defender of our faith,

44:26.791 --> 44:29.208
helping to ensure our safe
passage to The Garden.

44:29.860 --> 44:33.017
The tenth rung should be Augur.
Able to see without sight,

44:33.018 --> 44:35.298
able to know without
having to bear witness.

44:38.981 --> 44:40.984
Meyerism is born!

44:45.276 --> 44:48.102
What about the last three rungs, Steve?

45:15.053 --> 45:19.311
In this cave, I'll be your servant.

45:22.026 --> 45:23.061
Dad?

45:25.115 --> 45:26.743
Are you okay?

45:26.744 --> 45:28.497
I drove all night.

45:28.498 --> 45:30.249
I had to drive through
the night to get here.

45:30.250 --> 45:31.878
What happened?

45:31.879 --> 45:33.798
Honey, I'm here.

45:33.799 --> 45:35.384
I just want to be here.

45:35.385 --> 45:36.638
Let's just talk about the rest later.

45:36.639 --> 45:38.497
- Sit, sit.
- Sarah...

45:38.498 --> 45:40.049
I'll be back before it's over.

45:40.050 --> 45:42.190
I just need to check something out.

46:19.891 --> 46:23.314
Through the tangled roots of doubt...

46:44.858 --> 46:46.971
Where skunk cabbage blooms in dark...

47:15.001 --> 47:17.923
In this cave I'll be your servant...
