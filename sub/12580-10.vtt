00:33.933 --> 00:36.868
I have corrected your geometry homework
from last night.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.871
For anyone who did not get
the extra credit question...

00:39.973 --> 00:43.909
Peggy Hill was the
Substitute Teacher of the Year in 1996.

00:45.578 --> 00:49.571
I got number four wrong.
Explain it, please.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.107
Okay.

00:52.819 --> 00:53.877
""True or false?

00:53.987 --> 00:56.387
""A circle of diameter 3...

00:58.725 --> 01:02.491
""has a larger area than a square of side 3.""

01:03.363 --> 01:05.695
And the answer, of course, is...

01:07.233 --> 01:08.461
""False! ""

01:09.269 --> 01:10.327
Why?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.472
Well, just look at it.

01:16.676 --> 01:20.134
It's got the areas and your diameters.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.150
You can't show your work.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.276
-She stinks.
-Of course I can.

01:27.887 --> 01:30.947
But if I have to waste all my time
explaining number four to you...

01:31.057 --> 01:33.958
I will not have time to explain number five.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.488
""True.""

01:37.931 --> 01:39.159
[children chattering]

01:43.036 --> 01:46.301
(Hank) You know, if we're gonna follow
the Cowboys around when we retire...

01:46.406 --> 01:49.000
we'll be going
to your Green Bays and your Minnesotas...

01:49.109 --> 01:52.601
so an RV with a heated steering wheel
just makes sense.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.840
Of course, that means
we'll need the luxury cruiser...

01:55.949 --> 01:58.850
which is $5,000 more
than the deluxe cruiser.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.285
So, how much extra per month
do we need to put away?

02:02.388 --> 02:05.221
And just what is that supposed to mean?

02:05.558 --> 02:07.890
You think I can't do basic math?

02:07.994 --> 02:10.860
Is that why you've always handled
the retirement account?

02:10.964 --> 02:14.365
That's crazy.
You know I just enjoy going to the bank.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.163
Well, I am going from now on.
Compreide?

02:22.408 --> 02:25.138
Oh, Hank, I'm sorry.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.646
The truth is,
something else is upsetting me.

02:28.848 --> 02:32.284
Oh, well, okay. You feel better?

02:32.585 --> 02:36.612
No! Hank, my entire life,
I have always had all the answers.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.290
And today I didn't, and I'm scared.

02:39.392 --> 02:42.486
What if
I'm really not as smart as I think I am?

02:42.595 --> 02:43.562
[crying]

02:43.763 --> 02:47.995
Come on, Peggy. You've got an lQ of 170.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.591
You've said so lots of times.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.932
Yes, but there could be a margin of error...

02:52.038 --> 02:54.836
especially when it's just my own estimate.

02:54.941 --> 02:58.638
Hank,
I have never taken an lQ test in my life.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.039
Oh, God! What if I'm average?

03:03.616 --> 03:06.414
Do you have any idea
how dumb average is?

03:06.686 --> 03:07.653
[grunting]

03:11.824 --> 03:13.951
""The only intelligence-testing site...

03:15.395 --> 03:18.364
""endorsed by
the lntelligence lnstitute of Texas.""

03:18.464 --> 03:20.591
Even I sound smart reading that.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.136
Okay, Bobby, this needs to be official.
Ready?

03:26.839 --> 03:27.999
And go!

03:31.978 --> 03:33.138
[chiming]

03:33.246 --> 03:34.235
Done!

03:43.523 --> 03:44.751
Oh, yeah!

03:46.993 --> 03:50.087
Bobby,
you got a People and a Teei People,

03:50.463 --> 03:54.399
Peggy, you got a letter from the
""lntelligence lnstitute of--""

03:56.336 --> 03:59.567
""Dear genius,
based on your high intelligence score...

03:59.672 --> 04:02.732
""we extend an invitation
to join an elite group.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.704
""The 150 smartest people in Texas.

""Copies of the handsome
official registry of members...

""featuring your name, Peggy Hill...

04:11.818 --> 04:16.687
""may be purchased for only $39.99,
a $59.99 value! ""

04:17.023 --> 04:18.216
Can we buy one?

04:18.324 --> 04:21.452
The registry will be presented to me
at a ceremonial dinner...

04:21.560 --> 04:23.256
at the Hotel Arlen.

04:23.529 --> 04:27.260
No guests, of course,
unless they're also certified geniuses.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.858
Well, that's okay.
You go ahead and have fun.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.403
I'll just stay home
and watch the ballgame...

04:32.505 --> 04:34.439
unless you want me to take that test.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.201
Oh, Hank.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.171
My Nancy's a genius, too...

04:39.379 --> 04:42.371
a genius at having a great can!

04:43.216 --> 04:45.241
Yeah. Peggy's pretty excited about...

04:45.351 --> 04:48.479
getting her name in this book
that the lnstitute puts out.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.955
-lnstitute?
-Yeah. The lntelligence lnstitute.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.424
They recommend that we buy 20 books...

04:54.527 --> 04:57.291
but I'm hoping
Peggy will be satisfied with eight.

04:57.397 --> 04:58.830
Twenty books, eh?

04:58.931 --> 05:03.265
So, they administer the test,
and they sell the books.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.796
Sounds like
she is getting ripped off by them.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.269
-Now, wait a second.
-You're getting scammed.

05:11.377 --> 05:16.246
I should know. I lost a bundle
to that gypsy modeling school.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.246
Oh, Peggy.

05:19.252 --> 05:23.450
I'm just saying, if something sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.

05:23.556 --> 05:27.617
The books are almost $40 each.
That is not a very good deal.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.588
You know those pads of
eight-by-ten scratch paper Dale gave us?

05:31.698 --> 05:34.633
The ones with the picture of him
holding a tennis racket?

05:34.734 --> 05:37.635
Well, it turns out
those were part of a scam.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.900
Maybe you should go talk to him
before going to this dinner.

05:41.007 --> 05:45.205
Honey, it is sweet of you to be worried,
but I do not need your help.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.208
Oh, I wish my lenses were thicker.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.184
Hello. My name is Dr. Robert Vayzosa.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.915
I'm the provost
of the lntelligence lnstitute.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.652
It's such a pleasure and an honor,
and a little intimidating, I must say...

06:00.760 --> 06:03.729
to be standing here before you. My gosh.

06:03.830 --> 06:07.095
But before we begin
the presentation of the books...

06:07.200 --> 06:08.167
[exclaiming]

06:08.368 --> 06:09.699
[all gasping]

06:10.069 --> 06:13.038
I'd like to talk about an exciting way...

06:13.339 --> 06:18.038
for you to take your brainpower
and your lives to the max.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.809
To the max?

06:20.012 --> 06:23.379
You're all familiar with the benefits
of a PhD degree.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.452
The clock at the bank once said,
1 10 degrees!

06:28.187 --> 06:32.783
But what if you could get
that same prestigious degree at home...

06:33.192 --> 06:37.458
through a series of super-concentrated,
for-geniuses-only courses?

06:40.166 --> 06:43.397
Now, I know what you're thinking.
There's gotta be a catch.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.198
Well, there is.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.504
-What?
-What?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.965
You've got to be a genius.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.043
[people laughing]

06:52.245 --> 06:53.837
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

06:55.281 --> 06:59.081
I've always wanted a PhD, but $999?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.153
It just seems like a lot of money.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.985
If I had a PhD,
I'd stop being a sports announcer...

07:05.091 --> 07:07.559
and start calling chess games and such.

07:07.660 --> 07:11.289
I would quit my job
as a housekeeper at EconoSuites.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.965
I'm Jimmy.
I work at the car race where the cars race.

07:15.067 --> 07:18.161
If I was Dr. Jimmy,
no one would call me stupid.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.037
-""Dr. Jimmy"" does have a ring to it.
-Hey! I thought of it first!

07:22.141 --> 07:24.609
-Well, I know--
-Give it back! Give it back to me!

07:24.710 --> 07:26.439
Excuse me, geniuses.

07:26.546 --> 07:29.413
I hope you won't mind
if I borrow Mrs. Hill?

07:29.949 --> 07:30.916
[sighing]

07:31.050 --> 07:34.542
Dr. Vayzosa,
I must admit I am a little surprised...

07:34.654 --> 07:36.679
to see Jimmy Wichert here.

07:37.256 --> 07:40.885
I'm quite familiar with the man
and his work. And l--

07:40.993 --> 07:44.451
Peggy, Peggy, if you dropped
a box of toothpicks in front of him...

07:44.564 --> 07:46.589
you'd understand
why we at the lnstitute...

07:46.699 --> 07:48.860
expect great, great things
from Jimmy Wichert.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.699
However, they're nothing
compared to what we expect from you.

07:53.773 --> 07:57.766
Peggy,
I think you could be my greatest student.

07:57.877 --> 08:02.109
I feel the same way. But I don't have $999.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.544
Well, let's think about that.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.415
Do you have an lRA, savings account?

08:09.455 --> 08:10.945
A car? Do you have a car?

08:11.057 --> 08:14.288
Well, my husband and l
have been saving for our retirement.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.554
Well, Peggy, with a PhD in hand...

08:16.662 --> 08:19.529
your earning power is gonna skyrocket.

08:20.633 --> 08:21.600
[exclaiming]

08:22.702 --> 08:25.830
I don't have to tell a genius
what a doctor earns.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.372
Peggy, are you worth investing in?

08:35.313 --> 08:38.909
-Who should I make it out to?
-Cash is fine.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.419

[Ceremonial graduation music playing]

09:27.066 --> 09:30.627
Say good morning to Dr. Peggy Hill!

09:30.736 --> 09:34.570
-And how about some eggs, Doctor?
-Bobby, don't make fun of your mother.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.938
Hank, let me bring you up to speed.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.477
I have a PhD now.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.282
The lntelligence lnstitute sold me
everything I needed.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.443
They sold you a PhD? For how much?

09:47.553 --> 09:50.215
-$999.
-What?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.348
Where the heck did you get
that kind of money?

09:52.458 --> 09:53.755
From our retirement account.

09:53.859 --> 09:58.159
That was supposed to be our reward
for all the years of responsibility!

09:58.431 --> 10:00.262
How could you do this, Peggy?

10:00.366 --> 10:03.062
Wait. Are you mad
because I didn't do this sooner?

10:03.169 --> 10:05.865
No, I'm mad
because I didn't put my foot down...

10:05.972 --> 10:08.338
the moment I knew
you were in over your head...

10:08.441 --> 10:09.772
with a bunch of con artists!

10:09.875 --> 10:11.308
Oh, I see.

10:11.677 --> 10:15.238
Okay, so the only people who think
I am smart enough to earn a doctorate...

10:15.348 --> 10:17.282
must be con artists, is that it?

10:17.383 --> 10:20.284
I'm not convinced they think
you're all that smart, Peggy.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.617
They could have rigged that test
so anyone would look like a genius.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.156
Anyone, Hank?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.052
-I'm a genius!
-Okay, that's it.

10:28.260 --> 10:32.060
I'm gonna leave you two geniuses
right here while I clean up your mess.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.724
Hank, I do not need you
to clean up my messes.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.394
And this is not a mess! And I'll clean it up!

10:37.503 --> 10:38.800
It's over, Peggy.

10:38.904 --> 10:42.135
Let me put this in words
even a genius can understand.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.004
You are not a genius.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.646
Look, what I mean is....

10:48.114 --> 10:51.743
Okay, you've got what they call
book smarts.

10:51.851 --> 10:55.446
Now, if we wanted to write a story
about you losing our money...

10:55.554 --> 10:58.250
well, hands down,
you're the one for the job.

10:58.357 --> 11:01.815
But if we want to do something
that needs street smarts...

11:01.927 --> 11:05.658
Iike getting our money back from
the jerk who stole it, then I'm the guy.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.562
I can take care of it, Hank.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.228
Luckily, I have enough faith in me
for the both of us.

11:12.772 --> 11:13.864
Hank?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.988
I came for my money back.

11:30.990 --> 11:35.859
No, no. Listen, I said
you'd lose up to 30 pounds. Up to.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.121
[gasping]

11:37.229 --> 11:40.357
-You said I was a genius!
-No, no. Okay.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.793
Didn't you read the fine print
on your diploma?

11:43.903 --> 11:47.066
It clearly states, ""No refunds.""

11:47.673 --> 11:52.235
Nada refuido, Okay? No refunds.

11:55.581 --> 11:59.244
Unfortunately, I called you here
to give you some bad news.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.514
Dr. Robert Vayzosa is a con artist.

12:02.922 --> 12:06.551
The PhDs he sold us aren't even worth
the paper we printed them on!

12:06.659 --> 12:07.887
-No!
-What?

12:07.993 --> 12:11.656
Impossible! I've already received
several graduation gifts.

12:12.131 --> 12:15.259
A hat, a toaster, and a hat.

12:15.367 --> 12:20.270
Well, it turns out those intelligence tests
tested nothing but our gullibility.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.737
But we took the test!

12:21.841 --> 12:24.139
-Yes, I did.
-I took it, too.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.576
People, let me see
if I can explain it another way.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.479
Things are not always
as they appear to be.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.109
This looks like I pulled my thumb off.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.552
Oh! She pulled her thumb off!

12:36.655 --> 12:38.350
-Call a doctor!
-I'm a doctor.

12:38.457 --> 12:42.325
No.... Vayzosa lied to us to get our money.

12:42.928 --> 12:46.091
-Oh, my God! We were scammed!
-He took us for saps.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.460
What do we do now?

12:47.566 --> 12:51.468
Well, we get our money back
by conning the con man.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.505
And here is how it's gonna go down.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.305
(Peggy) Vayzosa already kiows
that Jimmy works at the race track,

12:58.410 --> 13:02.244
What he does iot kiow
is that the mob fixes the drag races,,,

13:02.348 --> 13:04.782
aid Jimmy always kiows
who's goiig to wii,

13:04.884 --> 13:07.409
Wait a secoid! There aii 't io fixed races!

13:07.520 --> 13:09.454
(Peggy) I said it was a coi, Jimmy,

13:09.555 --> 13:14.151
I tell Vayzosa there is ai illegal
bettiig parlor at the EcoioSuites,,,

13:14.260 --> 13:17.525

14:22.494 --> 14:25.292
You lend me the money, I will cut you in.

Time to bait the hook.

14:36.175 --> 14:39.440
Vayzosa's already taken us for $8,000.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.614
If I lose this, I'll have to be buried at sea.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.843
You have my word
they will put you in the ground.

14:46.151 --> 14:48.312
And that goes for all of you!

14:48.420 --> 14:49.648

15:26.992 --> 15:28.823
Got it. Scott Yancy.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.591
Welcome to the gambling parlor.
Your bet, sir?

15:33.165 --> 15:35.929
Yeah, $2,000 on Scott Yancy at 2-to-1.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.960
$2,000?

15:38.637 --> 15:41.504

15:55.955 --> 15:57.286
Pretty good. Pretty good.

15:57.389 --> 16:01.052
But, like my ex-wife used to say,
""Anybody can do it once.""

16:01.226 --> 16:02.420
[cell phone ringing]

16:03.162 --> 16:05.255
Jay-vee-air Martii-Z,

16:06.899 --> 16:08.764
Javier Martinez it is.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.364
Well, why not make this interesting?

16:11.470 --> 16:14.405
I'm gonna bet $6,000 at 2-to-1.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.005
And it's Javier Martinez...

16:17.109 --> 16:19.907
the Wacko from Waco all the way!

16:20.245 --> 16:22.008
Enough with this small change.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.446
I want to clean these Okies out.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.878
No. No, I don't want
to remove Mrs. Hill from the account.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.389
I'd just like to change the PlN number
to my birthday.

16:32.624 --> 16:36.025
Yes, I'll hold.
I'm sorry you had to hear that, Bobby.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.193
Your mother's a good woman.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.527
She's just not a good woman with money.

16:40.632 --> 16:44.363
Yeah. I just hope
she doesn't lose that second $1,000.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.795
-What?
-I'm sure she won't.

16:47.272 --> 16:50.070
It's just that
running a fake gambling parlor...

16:50.175 --> 16:53.576
out of the EconoSuites
is not as easy as it sounds.

16:53.679 --> 16:57.012
You've got races to stage, odds to rig...

16:57.116 --> 16:59.414
a lot of money to keep track of.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.248
But if anyone can do it, it's Mom.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.787
Oh, God!

17:04.556 --> 17:07.787
(woman) It's good there's plenty more
where that came from.

17:08.292 --> 17:09.885
R.J. Dobbs.

17:12.897 --> 17:14.126
That pays 4-to-1.

17:14.233 --> 17:19.068
Well, how much should I bet?
$10,000? Should I bet $15,000?

17:19.338 --> 17:21.636
Looks like they're ready to go!

17:21.740 --> 17:24.334
Well, you came with $8,000
and you've doubled it.

17:24.443 --> 17:28.038
-Why not bet all $16,000?
-Last call for bets, sir.

17:29.481 --> 17:33.383
Well, I could bet it all and win $64,000.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.747
Yeah. On the other hand...

17:37.122 --> 17:40.182
I could just take my money
and walk out of here.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.988
But you're going to win! I promise!

17:43.729 --> 17:47.392
Yeah, but I don't know,
somehow it just seems greedy.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.496
It just seems greedy.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.370
Goodbye, Peggy. Thank you so much.

17:53.038 --> 17:56.132
Thanks for all of this money.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.265
[laughing]

17:59.011 --> 18:02.913
(Tug)
Aid R,J, Dobbs loses!

18:04.483 --> 18:06.144
(both)
Huh? And?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.244
He didn't place the bet.

18:10.355 --> 18:13.552
What are we gonna do, Peggy?
He took all our money.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.761
Peggy! Bobby told me everything!

18:16.862 --> 18:19.956
Oh, Hank. I don't know how he did it...

18:20.065 --> 18:22.863
but Vayzosa saw right through our scam!

18:23.202 --> 18:25.432
All the money is gone!

18:27.639 --> 18:30.506
I should have listened to you, but I didn't.

18:31.076 --> 18:34.477
While you were talking,
I was humming a song inside my head...

18:34.580 --> 18:36.775
just waiting for you to stop!

18:38.684 --> 18:41.244
I've ruined the rest of our lives!

18:41.620 --> 18:45.716
And Vayzosa's up in Room 27,
laughing at us!

18:46.892 --> 18:50.225
No, he's laughing at you.
He doesn't know I'm coming.

18:52.531 --> 18:53.555
[banging on door]

18:53.665 --> 18:55.826
Open up, Vayzosa! This is Hank Hill!

18:56.034 --> 18:58.127
I want my wife's money back!

18:58.637 --> 19:02.505
I'm not messing around here!
Now you open this door right now!

19:02.608 --> 19:03.973
[banging on door]

19:05.043 --> 19:06.442
You hear me?

19:08.313 --> 19:09.871
I'm not fooling!

19:11.583 --> 19:14.245
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:17.589 --> 19:21.719
Oh, is it your first time in a hotel room?
Go ahead. Take the Bible.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.592
It's got to be here somewhere.

19:30.903 --> 19:31.892
[sighing]

19:32.004 --> 19:33.232
Nothing.

19:34.239 --> 19:38.141
You don't want to do this the easy way,
fine, I'll just call the cops.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.574
And tell them what?

19:39.678 --> 19:43.136
That your wife was running
a fraudulent betting parlor?

19:43.415 --> 19:46.543
That's right, Mr. Hill.
Ain't nothing you can do.

19:46.985 --> 19:48.953
Look, you married a fool.

19:50.923 --> 19:54.484
Now, unless you're interested
in losing up to 30 pounds....

19:58.664 --> 19:59.653
No!

20:03.068 --> 20:04.035
[ringing]

20:05.671 --> 20:07.434
My room safe is gone!

20:07.706 --> 20:11.369
This is EconoSuites.
We don't have room safes.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.735
What? Oh!

20:19.384 --> 20:20.715
Thanks, Boomhauer.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.219
I knew I could count on you not to talk.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.516
Yo, man.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.555
[panting]

20:36.969 --> 20:39.597
No! No!

20:42.107 --> 20:44.200
Oh, yeah! Give me them bad boys!

20:44.810 --> 20:48.473
Well, I gotta hand it to you.
You made me look like a jackass...

20:48.580 --> 20:50.377
but you got everyone's money back.

20:50.482 --> 20:53.315
Mom, I know a magician's
not supposed to reveal his--

20:53.418 --> 20:54.817
Here's how I did it.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.014
I knew Vayzosa was too smart
for a straight-up con.

20:58.123 --> 21:02.025
But that over-confidence would prove
to be his fatal flaw.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.061
I ran an obvious bad con...

21:04.162 --> 21:07.427
to distract him
from my secret brilliant con.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.261
But there was one thing I was missing.

21:10.369 --> 21:14.703
A bellowing dupe whose incessant need
to rescue his helpless wife...

21:15.140 --> 21:18.837
would drive Vayzosa
to stash all his money in his room safe.

21:19.044 --> 21:22.445
Luckily, I had you, Hank,
thanks to you, Bobby.

21:23.548 --> 21:27.006
Okay, okay, so I doubted you,
like you thought I would.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.986
What if I didn't?
What if I'd believed in you?

21:30.088 --> 21:33.182
-Then where would we be, huh?
-I covered that base, too.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.352
-Vayzosa valet-parked his car.
-So?

21:36.695 --> 21:39.528
The EconoSuites
doesn't have valet parking.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.262
[laughing]

21:41.566 --> 21:45.627
You were gonna steal his car.
That would have been a felony.

21:45.871 --> 21:48.362
But that other stuff, that's genius.

21:48.674 --> 21:52.508
Yep. There is one thing
Vayzosa never counted on.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.501
Dr. Peggy Hill!

22:30.115 --> 22:32.777
(Jimmy) Oh! She pulled her thumb off!
Call a doctor!
