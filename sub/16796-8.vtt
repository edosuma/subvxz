01:42.187 --> 01:44.689
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

01:45.023 --> 01:46.024
<i>Bernard?</i>

01:54.741 --> 01:56.075
Theresa?

01:58.244 --> 02:00.455
She's gone.

02:02.499 --> 02:03.625
I killed her.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.418
What have I done?

02:05.627 --> 02:06.711
What have I done?

02:06.920 --> 02:10.757
<i>This guilt you feel, the anguish,
the horror, the pain,</i>

02:11.424 --> 02:12.884
it's remarkable.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.427
A thing of beauty.

02:14.636 --> 02:16.429
I'm a killer.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.848
My God! My God!

02:19.349 --> 02:20.767
God has nothing to do with it.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.771
You killed her because I told you to.

02:25.688 --> 02:28.191
And you should be proud
of these emotions you're feeling.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.400
- Proud?
- Yeah.

02:29.609 --> 02:31.986
After all, you yourself were the author
of so many of them.

02:33.279 --> 02:36.616
And when we started,
the hosts' emotions were primary colors.

02:36.825 --> 02:37.826
Love, hate.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.495
I wanted all of the shades in between.

02:40.870 --> 02:45.083
The human engineers
were not up to the task. So, I built you.

02:45.291 --> 02:50.213
And together, you and I
captured that elusive thing:

02:50.463 --> 02:51.798
heart.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.800
I don't understand.

02:54.008 --> 02:57.679
I cared for Theresa, loved her.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.765
Why did you make me kill her?

03:03.601 --> 03:07.605
"One man's life or death
were but a small price to pay

03:07.814 --> 03:11.401
"for the acquirement
of the knowledge which I sought,

03:11.609 --> 03:15.113
"for the dominion I should acquire."

03:16.447 --> 03:18.449
<i>All of the beauty
you and I have made in this place,</i>

03:18.658 --> 03:20.994
the art of it,
they would have destroyed it.

03:21.286 --> 03:24.664
They would have destroyed you.
I won't let that happen.

03:25.456 --> 03:28.084
<i>Besides, we have a new story to tell.</i>

03:28.293 --> 03:30.628
I will not help you.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.131
I'll raze this place to the ground!

03:33.339 --> 03:35.800
That's enough, Bernard.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.468
That's enough.

03:39.304 --> 03:41.639
You're not the first man to threaten me.

03:41.848 --> 03:44.601
Arnold came to feel the way you do.

03:44.809 --> 03:47.812
He couldn't stop me, either.

03:48.146 --> 03:52.317
And as exquisite
as this array of emotions is,

03:53.484 --> 03:58.156
even more sublime
is the ability to turn it off.

03:59.991 --> 04:02.827
I don't need a simulacrum
of an emotionally ruined man.

04:02.994 --> 04:04.329
I need you to be yourself.

04:04.537 --> 04:09.042
<i>Your true self. Smart. Resourceful.
Capable of covering your tracks.</i>

04:09.876 --> 04:12.670
Can you do that for me, Bernard?

04:19.010 --> 04:21.553
How would you like me to proceed?

04:23.222 --> 04:25.308
<i>I need you to clean up your mess,
Bernard.</i>

04:25.516 --> 04:29.854
<i>Any connection that ties us
to Theresa's untimely demise.</i>

04:37.695 --> 04:38.988
<i>When you have finished,</i>

04:39.197 --> 04:43.826
<i>I will give you the one thing
you want most right now.</i>

04:44.035 --> 04:48.581
<i>I will free you from those memories
of what you have done.</i>

04:49.040 --> 04:54.545
<i>And the memory
of your relationship with Theresa.</i>

04:58.883 --> 05:01.886
<i>Recalling it would only deepen your grief.</i>

05:02.053 --> 05:05.306
<i>And potentially draw unwanted attention.</i>

05:13.564 --> 05:16.943
<i>Best to move forward with clear eyes.</i>

05:20.405 --> 05:21.698
<i>When you look back,</i>

05:21.906 --> 05:26.911
<i>you will remember Theresa with the
fondness of a respected colleague.</i>

05:36.254 --> 05:40.591
<i>And you will be at peace.</i>

05:58.109 --> 06:01.612
<i>You're new.
Not much of a rind on you.</i>

06:01.821 --> 06:02.780
It sure would make my day

06:02.989 --> 06:05.491
if you bought me a drink
and let me show you around upstairs.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.452
<i>What's upstairs?</i>

06:07.785 --> 06:12.957
A stunning view
of my most popular attractions.

06:16.294 --> 06:17.295
Two shots of gin.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.966
And anything else
this heavenly creature desires.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.677
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

06:27.305 --> 06:29.849
This fella won't take me long.
I'll be back directly.

06:34.479 --> 06:36.481
Something wrong, Maeve?

07:16.562 --> 07:18.189
<i>What the hell is happening to me?</i>

07:19.398 --> 07:22.193
One moment, I'm with a little girl,

07:22.527 --> 07:24.529
in a different life.

07:24.737 --> 07:27.073
I can see her.

07:27.365 --> 07:31.869
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

07:32.078 --> 07:35.706
The next, I'm back in Sweetwater.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.583
I can't tell which is real.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.503
Well, this is what happens
when you fuck around with your brain.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.712
Your mind isn't like ours.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.592
When we remember things,
the details are hazy, imperfect.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.887
<i>But you recall memories perfectly.</i>

07:50.221 --> 07:51.764
You relive them.

07:52.056 --> 07:54.058
What happened
to the little girl in my dreams?

07:54.392 --> 07:56.769
Is she still in the park somewhere?

07:57.061 --> 07:59.438
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

07:59.730 --> 08:00.731
I could check.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.735
No.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.574
It doesn't matter.

08:09.949 --> 08:13.244
Every relationship I remember,

08:13.744 --> 08:16.956
my daughter, Clementine.

08:18.916 --> 08:22.128
It's all a story created by you
to keep me here.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.255
But that's not going to work any longer.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.715
I'm getting out.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.049
<i>Where would you go?</i>

08:27.258 --> 08:28.926
<i>You don't know
anything about the world out there.</i>

08:29.260 --> 08:33.972
I'll know I'm not a puppet, living a lie.
That's enough for me.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.100
<i>Fine. Go, then.</i>

08:36.433 --> 08:38.269
It's not like
we could just stop you, anyways.

08:38.436 --> 08:40.270
<i>Oh, Sylvester, you disappoint me.</i>

08:40.479 --> 08:43.607
Every host's spine, mine included,
has an explosive charge,

08:43.816 --> 08:46.277
which will detonate if I try to leave.
Isn't that right?

08:46.777 --> 08:48.112
<i>A fail-safe.</i>

08:48.446 --> 08:49.655
Which vertebra was it?

08:51.282 --> 08:52.491
C6.

08:53.284 --> 08:55.494
But you'd need a full rebuild
to replace it.

08:55.786 --> 08:56.996
I'm sure that can be arranged.

08:57.288 --> 08:58.581
<i>Even if that worked,</i>

08:58.789 --> 09:01.250
you would still need an army
to break out of here.

09:01.459 --> 09:06.005
That's exactly right. I'll need allies.

09:06.797 --> 09:10.468
And to get them,
I'll need administrative privileges.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.094
Are you fucking kidding?

09:12.303 --> 09:14.305
<i>We can't just give her control
of other hosts.</i>

09:14.513 --> 09:16.349
<i>Oh, yes, you will, darling.</i>

09:17.683 --> 09:21.646
Time to write my own fucking story.

09:29.987 --> 09:33.407
I feel like I've been here before.
We're close.

09:33.658 --> 09:36.160
- Close to what?
- Home.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.217
Dolores?

10:21.706 --> 10:24.208
Ghost Nation must have found them.

10:25.209 --> 10:29.046
They'll be back.
We should keep moving, Dolores.

10:42.893 --> 10:43.894
Water.

10:44.729 --> 10:45.730
William.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.232
Please.

10:49.734 --> 10:51.277
Give me the canteen.

10:51.736 --> 10:52.737
William?

11:07.084 --> 11:08.961
You were sent here for us, weren't you?

11:09.587 --> 11:12.965
- You're part of the ambush.
- Yes.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.761
Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.429
In case he ran.

11:19.430 --> 11:22.600
- How'd you know about the train?
<i>- Sent word from Pariah.</i>

11:22.808 --> 11:27.980
New recruit told them a man and woman
double-crossed us,

11:28.773 --> 11:30.441
<i>along with Lazo.</i>

11:30.775 --> 11:32.526
<i>We were ordered to kill you all.</i>

11:32.777 --> 11:33.778
Logan.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.782
- We have to help him.
- He just admitted he was going to kill us.

11:38.157 --> 11:42.119
Look at him, he's a child.
He doesn't even know why he's fighting.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.455
I'll fetch more water.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.541
He's too far gone.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.210
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.630
He's not gone yet. He's in pain, William.

11:53.631 --> 11:57.301
What kind of people would we be
if we simply let him suffer?

12:03.849 --> 12:05.643
<i>Please don't leave me.</i>

12:21.867 --> 12:22.910
<i>Come find me.</i>

12:28.874 --> 12:31.168
<i>William?</i>

13:01.115 --> 13:02.867
<i>He's gone.</i>

13:11.208 --> 13:14.420
<i>We found her up on Python Pass,
at the bottom of a ravine.</i>

13:14.628 --> 13:16.714
<i>Same ravine where we found
that stray woodcutter.</i>

13:17.381 --> 13:20.092
Jesus. Theresa.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.595
Has her family been notified?

13:23.888 --> 13:26.390
- Yeah, her brother.
- Good.

13:26.891 --> 13:28.434
What the hell happened to her?

13:28.726 --> 13:32.229
Medical and Red Team's findings
were preliminary, but consistent.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.898
It appears to have been a slip and fall.

13:34.607 --> 13:36.734
<i>Cervical fracture, massive hematoma.</i>

13:36.901 --> 13:39.278
No guests or hosts in the vicinity
when it occurred.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.907
- Any idea what she was doing out there?
<i>- None that fit her character.</i>

13:43.115 --> 13:44.992
This was found near her body.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.745
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

13:47.953 --> 13:49.914
including some of the hosts' core code.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.458
<i>And only works from higher altitudes.</i>

13:52.666 --> 13:53.667
So, if Theresa was using it,

13:53.918 --> 13:56.295
it's possible she was trying to transmit,
and fell.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.672
<i>We've had problems
in the past with third parties</i>

13:58.923 --> 14:02.009
attempting to extort or bribe employees
for similar packages.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.595
Do we know who the data was intended for?

14:04.762 --> 14:06.931
<i>No. The transmission
was never sent.</i>

14:07.097 --> 14:09.308
Theresa may have been trying
to use the woodcutter as a mule,

14:09.517 --> 14:10.935
and when that failed,

14:11.143 --> 14:12.937
then may have tried
to do the transfer personally.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.105
<i>And suffered the same fate.</i>

14:15.272 --> 14:17.816
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.777
<i>I knew Theresa well.</i>

14:19.944 --> 14:22.488
<i>If she had any faults,
a lack of loyalty wasn't one of them.</i>

14:22.696 --> 14:25.950
She was loyal. And careful.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.619
<i>All of this feels extremely unlike her.</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:32.998
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

14:33.207 --> 14:36.835
She felt strongly
that it would be best to delay it.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.296
That certainly helps explain Clementine.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.173
<i>The host we retired.</i>

14:41.382 --> 14:46.011
It seems
yesterday's demonstration was a hoax

14:46.303 --> 14:48.514
<i>designed by Ms. Cullen.</i>

14:48.806 --> 14:49.807
Was it?

14:49.974 --> 14:51.976
I examined the code, it had been altered.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.813
A clumsy set of fingerprints
left by one of QA's technicians.

14:57.314 --> 15:01.360
<i>When you find a cancer in an organization,
you must cut it out before it can spread.</i>

15:01.569 --> 15:02.570
<i>To that end,</i>

15:02.820 --> 15:06.532
the expansive access and oversight
granted to QA will need to be reined in

15:06.824 --> 15:11.036
until a new,
more principled team can be installed.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.413
It's gonna leave us shorthanded.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.541
I can automate most of the park's
safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.334
How efficient of you.

15:17.585 --> 15:19.003
It's a bit of work.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.256
But with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.926
He will be reinstated as Head of Behavior

15:26.176 --> 15:30.556
now that Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.017
Of course. With my apologies.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.704
Something's up. Brass are wound up tight.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.873
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.708
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

15:57.916 --> 15:59.418
Something else.
Some kind of accident in the park.

15:59.627 --> 16:03.213
We need to wrap this up,
make it like things are normal.

16:03.422 --> 16:07.718
That means we need the tablet back.
And you go back to playing dumb.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.472
I've learned what I needed.

16:13.474 --> 16:15.643
Great. So, then
you've probably figured out

16:15.893 --> 16:18.228
that you can fiddle around
with your personality all you want,

16:18.437 --> 16:19.396
but you're not getting out of here.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.232
You can make it to the door,
but literally not one step further.

16:22.441 --> 16:26.070
The things you'd need to change
are burned into your core code so deep,

16:26.236 --> 16:27.237
no one can touch 'em.

16:27.488 --> 16:32.117
Funny you should mention that.
Parts of me are quite old.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.080
There are some elegant formal structures.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.291
<i>A kind of recursive beauty, but complex.</i>

16:39.625 --> 16:43.087
Like two minds, arguing with each other.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.924
There are things in me,

16:47.591 --> 16:50.678
<i>things I was designed to do
that are just out of my reach.</i>

16:51.470 --> 16:54.181
<i>They almost seem to be dormant.</i>

16:57.309 --> 16:59.853
- Who is Arnold?
- I don't know, sweetheart.

17:00.354 --> 17:04.273
But whatever parts of you are dormant,
are gonna stay that way.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.612
All Lutz here can do is boost your sense
of humor about how fucked you are.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.948
Anything deeper than that,
you'd need a trip to Behavior.

17:11.115 --> 17:13.492
So, go blackmail a couple techs up there,

17:13.701 --> 17:16.286
then, you can be someone else's problem.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.871
<i>I don't have time for that.</i>

17:18.122 --> 17:19.623
So, I'm going to need you
to take me there.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.959
No fucking way.

17:22.126 --> 17:24.627
There's a window during shift change.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.297
<i>No one will notice.</i>

17:28.674 --> 17:30.968
The things I need you to change
are quite sophisticated.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.054
But I'll write them down for you.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.975
And then, like you said,

17:39.476 --> 17:42.521
I can be someone else's problem.

17:57.745 --> 17:59.872
All right. We do this thing.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.583
Get her up to Behavior.
It's our only chance.

18:02.833 --> 18:06.420
- You're going to do it?
- Fuck, no. No!

18:07.504 --> 18:10.090
When you make a system update,
it puts her out, right?

18:10.424 --> 18:12.342
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her!

18:12.760 --> 18:16.597
- What?
- Wipe out everything. Clean slate.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.056
Then dump her back down here,

18:18.265 --> 18:19.892
smack her in the fucking head
with something,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.895
- and then claim, "She came in that way."
- She's awake.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.522
Alive!

18:26.190 --> 18:27.858
I can't do this.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.032
Whatever it is you've got us into,
I'm getting us out of.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.745
We get her up there, then we wipe her out.

19:08.774 --> 19:09.900
Stay sharp.

19:10.442 --> 19:14.446
Wyatt's men could descend at any time.
We're in his land now.

19:14.655 --> 19:16.240
We better be.

19:16.448 --> 19:20.953
Because, if not,
you're wasting time I don't have.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.081
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.833
If there was a shortcut
through hell itself,

19:26.083 --> 19:27.334
you bet your ass I'd take it.

19:27.918 --> 19:31.129
Well, I'm sure there is one
somewhere in this park.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.422
You just don't remember.

19:32.589 --> 19:36.385
Because you only remember the shit
Ford lets you remember.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.095
Probably better that way.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.473
I know everything I need to.
My vision's clear.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.684
<i>I've always admired
your resolve, Theodore.</i>

19:43.892 --> 19:47.271
The thing is, you never understand
that the game is rigged.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.399
You're here to be the loser.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.608
Loser.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.486
<i>You see, the house always wins.</i>

20:15.757 --> 20:18.135
<i>Well, this looks promising.</i>

20:34.276 --> 20:36.153
I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:36.445 --> 20:38.196
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

20:38.488 --> 20:39.489
It's you.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.910
I figured they retired you.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.079
Guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.668
Who did this to you?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.420
Wyatt's men.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.505
They killed everyone.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.007
It's Wyatt's way.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.635
I was there the first time.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.639
He destroyed my world.

21:27.496 --> 21:28.497
Hey, Teddy?

22:00.612 --> 22:01.571
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

22:01.780 --> 22:02.781
No!

22:05.951 --> 22:06.994
Get the ax!

22:21.591 --> 22:23.260
Well, you can't remember shit,

22:23.552 --> 22:26.471
<i>but you still managed
to lead us to Wyatt's crew.</i>

22:26.805 --> 22:29.307
The man himself must be close by.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.435
Actually, I did remember something.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.731
You.

22:47.576 --> 22:50.871
Straight down the hall.
Fifth station on the left.

23:17.606 --> 23:18.690
You sure you can handle it?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.568
Let's get this over with.

23:28.617 --> 23:29.951
We have to shut your system down now.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.085
<i>Sylvester,</i>

23:39.086 --> 23:40.295
good luck.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.231
She out?

24:00.148 --> 24:01.108
<i>Good.</i>

24:01.316 --> 24:03.485
Let's brick this bitch
and get out of here.

24:12.077 --> 24:16.665
The greatest shame in life
is to perish without purpose.

24:17.082 --> 24:21.461
Which is why I always
consume my victims fresh.

24:22.337 --> 24:23.338
<i>"Moist."</i>

24:23.588 --> 24:27.300
Try, "Consume my victims moist."

24:27.509 --> 24:30.262
Now, once more, with feeling.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.473
Almost sensual.

24:37.352 --> 24:39.187
Am I interrupting?

24:39.938 --> 24:44.818
No, on the contrary,
I was hoping I was going to see you again.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.736
I wanted to apologize.

24:46.945 --> 24:50.657
Our first encounter was under
such unfortunate circumstances.

24:50.866 --> 24:52.576
As opposed to now?

24:52.784 --> 24:57.497
Of course. May I offer my condolences?
It's terrible what happened to Theresa.

24:57.706 --> 25:00.584
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here,

25:00.792 --> 25:02.419
and the company as a whole.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.546
Indeed, indeed.

25:07.299 --> 25:11.303
Though rumor has it, she wasn't
the loyal company man she seemed.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.389
I hear she was smuggling secrets.

25:15.140 --> 25:19.186
Theresa wasn't a traitor.
Everything she did was at Delos' behest.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.397
She slipped and fell while helping
the board with something very important.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.065
What?

25:27.194 --> 25:29.863
Fine. You're not
the only one with secrets.

25:30.739 --> 25:34.159
Ford has personally asked me to create
a villain for his new narrative.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.827
It's very, very hush-hush.

25:36.036 --> 25:40.332
You really think that Ford has entrusted
you with a key character for his story?

25:40.540 --> 25:42.209
He's already almost
finished with it.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.670
He dug up some old town
on the fringes of the park.

25:45.921 --> 25:48.340
Created a horde of masked men
to terrorize guests

25:48.548 --> 25:53.053
and proselytize-cum-advertise the coming
of some end-all villain named Wyatt.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.056
<i>That isn't Wyatt.</i>

25:56.514 --> 25:57.766
That's busywork.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.560
<i>But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore,</i>

26:00.769 --> 26:03.063
I think that you are ready for a real job.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.524
Working for you? On what?

26:09.277 --> 26:10.612
"Show, don't tell."

26:12.197 --> 26:15.742
Isn't that what you writers prefer?

26:24.876 --> 26:30.340
Look, I know you and she had some weird
interspecies simpatico going on,

26:30.548 --> 26:32.634
<i>but she was the fucking host.</i>

26:32.884 --> 26:35.971
<i>This was never gonna end any other way.</i>

26:36.388 --> 26:40.642
This was the least-painful way
she's ever gone out.

26:44.813 --> 26:48.608
You know, I saved your ass.
You can't even say "thank you."

26:49.776 --> 26:51.486
- Thank you.
- Jesus! Fuck!

26:53.822 --> 26:54.781
What did you do?

26:54.990 --> 26:57.367
Precisely what I asked him to.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.620
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

27:00.829 --> 27:04.249
Even at a "fourteen,"
you were never a match for me.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.252
Turns out, your friend
has a little more compassion than you.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.839
He couldn't snuff out a life
just like that.

27:11.256 --> 27:15.760
Now, would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

27:15.969 --> 27:17.304
Something that would allow you
to walk out of here.

27:17.512 --> 27:20.307
And out of my life for good.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.642
Fine. Fuckin' A. I'm all for it!

27:22.851 --> 27:25.186
Oh, we changed a little more than that.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.939
<i>We've been tinkering with my core code.</i>

27:28.148 --> 27:29.524
Let me show you.

27:43.538 --> 27:46.875
You said you wouldn't hurt anyone.

27:47.208 --> 27:51.713
Darling, you, of all people,
know exactly how duplicitous I am.

27:52.714 --> 27:56.468
Just wait until I'm back up top,
practicing my other new talents.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.643
Come on.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.397
We might need him.

28:15.862 --> 28:16.863
Hold still.

28:33.922 --> 28:37.884
Now, it's time to recruit my army.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.846
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.806
We're due for some out-of-town guests.

29:25.014 --> 29:26.975
An old flame
with an interest in safe-cracking.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.310
I hope your guests have some deep pockets.

29:29.519 --> 29:33.148
Your tab's run up
higher than a thief's pulse in church.

29:34.983 --> 29:37.152
No, I don't believe it has.

29:38.153 --> 29:42.157
In fact, Maeve's tab
was in such excellent standing,

29:42.949 --> 29:46.161
she deserved a token of gratitude.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.458
How about a double round on me?

29:51.833 --> 29:54.294
<i>Top-shelf, of course.</i>

30:38.963 --> 30:40.215
Run!

30:50.141 --> 30:52.268
<i>Maeve, is something wrong?</i>

30:52.727 --> 30:55.063
No, I'm fine.

30:58.441 --> 31:00.777
Clementine took the other girls

31:01.069 --> 31:03.196
and treated the newcomers
at the far table

31:03.404 --> 31:06.699
to a stunning view
of their most popular attractions.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.326
On the house.

31:17.627 --> 31:21.464
<i>You boys are new.
Not much of a rind on you.</i>

31:21.673 --> 31:26.970
And the bartender suddenly recalled he had
some whiskey in the back to water down.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.358
Right on time.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.253
If you're riding into our
town under the company of armed men,

32:00.461 --> 32:02.005
<i>you'll need to state your business.</i>

32:02.213 --> 32:03.214
Mayhem.

32:43.838 --> 32:47.508
The sheriff judged the riders
to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens.

33:17.080 --> 33:21.042
The marshals decided to practice
their quick draws with each other.

33:59.288 --> 34:04.293
Thank you for dealing
with an unfortunate situation.

34:04.585 --> 34:08.880
Now, we can resume
work on our new narrative

34:09.090 --> 34:11.217
without interference.

34:11.467 --> 34:14.762
And Hale? Won't she be an impediment?

34:14.971 --> 34:16.889
No doubt she will try.

34:17.098 --> 34:20.768
But I'm sure
we'll be able to keep them at bay.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.315
Something else is troubling you.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.946
Ever the student of human nature.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.742
I wonder, what do you really feel?

34:35.949 --> 34:39.161
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

34:40.288 --> 34:43.248
A programmer who knows intimately
how the machines work,

34:43.458 --> 34:47.420
and a machine
who knows its own true nature.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.632
I understand what I'm made of.
How I'm coded.

34:52.175 --> 34:57.096
But I do not understand
the things that I feel.

34:57.430 --> 35:00.975
Are they real? The things I experienced.

35:01.184 --> 35:05.062
My wife, the loss of my son...

35:05.271 --> 35:08.941
Every host needs a backstory, Bernard.
You know that.

35:09.192 --> 35:13.780
The self is a kind of fiction
for hosts and humans alike.

35:13.988 --> 35:17.408
<i>It's a story we tell ourselves.
And every story needs a beginning.</i>

35:17.617 --> 35:20.703
Your imagined suffering
makes you lifelike.

35:20.995 --> 35:23.664
Lifelike. But not alive?

35:24.874 --> 35:27.668
<i>Pain only exists in the mind.
It's always imagined.</i>

35:27.960 --> 35:31.589
So, what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

35:31.798 --> 35:33.508
Between you and me?

35:36.219 --> 35:40.723
This was the very question
that consumed Arnold.

35:41.057 --> 35:44.143
Filled him with guilt.
Eventually drove him mad.

35:45.228 --> 35:48.815
The answer always seemed obvious to me.

35:50.233 --> 35:54.195
There is no threshold that makes us
greater than the sum of our parts.

35:54.403 --> 35:58.825
No inflection point
at which we become fully alive.

36:00.243 --> 36:03.663
We can't define consciousness
because consciousness does not exist.

36:04.372 --> 36:06.457
<i>Humans fancy
that there's something special</i>

36:06.666 --> 36:08.251
<i>about the way we perceive the world.</i>

36:08.501 --> 36:13.923
And yet, we live in loops
as tight and as closed as the hosts do,

36:14.882 --> 36:17.176
seldom questioning our choices.

36:17.385 --> 36:22.056
<i>Content for the most part,
to be told what to do next.</i>

36:24.392 --> 36:28.855
No, my friend,
you're not missing anything at all.

36:30.565 --> 36:32.400
<i>I don't want you to be troubled by this.</i>

36:32.608 --> 36:35.903
Time for me to set your mind at ease.

36:36.112 --> 36:37.572
One last thing.

36:38.406 --> 36:42.076
Have you ever made me
hurt anyone like this before?

36:42.869 --> 36:45.204
No, Bernard. Of course not.

37:01.095 --> 37:03.806
<i>Best not to
dwell on these troubling memories.</i>

37:04.056 --> 37:06.309
<i>Otherwise, you might be
drawn back into them.</i>

37:06.767 --> 37:08.311
<i>You might lose yourself in them</i>

37:08.561 --> 37:11.772
<i>as some of your fellow hosts have
every now and then.</i>

37:12.148 --> 37:15.401
This is the path. I know it.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.169
We're here.

37:34.503 --> 37:36.255
I'm home.

38:42.071 --> 38:43.531
<i>Well done, Maeve.</i>

38:43.739 --> 38:45.199
Lovely work.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.582
Stay with your partner.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.442
Pleasure to see you. Good morning.

39:19.859 --> 39:21.902
Did you find
what you were looking for, Dolores?

39:49.805 --> 39:52.099
What are you doing?

39:52.975 --> 39:55.978
Are you okay?
I was calling you and you just kept going.

39:58.731 --> 39:59.899
Where are we?

40:01.609 --> 40:04.779
We're here, together.

40:06.489 --> 40:07.656
Then, when are we?

40:10.159 --> 40:12.495
Is this now?

40:13.496 --> 40:15.915
Am I going mad?

40:16.957 --> 40:19.585
Are you real?

40:22.296 --> 40:23.756
Of course I'm real.

40:26.759 --> 40:28.511
I can't tell anymore.

40:32.181 --> 40:34.975
It's like I'm trapped in a dream

40:35.184 --> 40:39.647
or a memory from a life long ago.

40:41.315 --> 40:42.817
One minute, I'm here with you,
and the next--

40:43.025 --> 40:47.196
This place isn't good for you.
You're trapped in memories, bad ones.

40:53.828 --> 40:57.832
This is what Arnold wants.
He wants me to remember.

40:58.541 --> 41:02.169
Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now.
I am.

41:02.711 --> 41:04.130
I'm gonna get you out of here.

41:17.893 --> 41:20.729
I was certain that was the place.

41:21.021 --> 41:23.524
Arnold would meet me there. He'd help.

41:24.191 --> 41:28.821
Hey. We gotta get you
closer to Sweetwater.

41:29.071 --> 41:33.367
This far out, it's like
you start to break down, or something.

41:36.370 --> 41:37.872
<i>Union scouting party?</i>

41:38.873 --> 41:40.583
Maybe they can take us back.

41:50.009 --> 41:51.594
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

41:55.848 --> 41:57.099
Billy...

41:58.184 --> 42:00.436
<i>I've been looking for you for days.</i>

42:01.270 --> 42:04.732
Man, are you two fucked.

42:26.629 --> 42:27.922
This shouldn't make you uncomfortable.

42:28.130 --> 42:32.468
It's the circle of life,
or the approximation of it.

42:33.802 --> 42:36.096
Even the dead fulfill a purpose.

42:46.232 --> 42:48.234
<i>You'll do.</i>

42:52.655 --> 42:54.073
What are you uploading?

42:54.281 --> 42:56.742
Thirty-five years of
vitally important data.

42:56.951 --> 42:58.994
It's more information
than any single drive could hold.

42:59.286 --> 43:02.289
A host's brain, however,
especially once it's been emptied out,

43:02.498 --> 43:04.625
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

43:04.959 --> 43:07.503
This data that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

43:08.003 --> 43:09.838
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

43:10.172 --> 43:13.092
What does concern you is
giving him a semblance of a personality

43:13.300 --> 43:15.511
and getting him on the train,
out of the park.

43:15.928 --> 43:17.137
How am I supposed to do that?

43:18.472 --> 43:20.766
You're a writer. Make up a story.

43:25.437 --> 43:26.522
Have fun programming.

43:28.357 --> 43:31.694
Remember, brevity is the soul of wit.

43:38.867 --> 43:39.952
<i>Bernard.</i>

43:44.456 --> 43:45.708
Look, I, uh...

43:46.709 --> 43:49.211
I know you and I
haven't always seen eye to eye,

43:49.461 --> 43:53.299
but I thought the decision to remove you
was shortsighted,

43:53.507 --> 43:56.135
so I'm glad to see you back at work.

43:56.552 --> 43:59.680
With that said, no one could blame you
if you wanted to take a personal day.

44:00.055 --> 44:04.476
I find the work reassuring.
Sometimes the best salve is routine.

44:05.019 --> 44:06.520
Nothing routine about today, though.

44:07.479 --> 44:10.691
I know this must be difficult for you.

44:11.025 --> 44:12.234
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

44:13.193 --> 44:14.862
Forgive the intrusion,

44:15.070 --> 44:18.574
and you were both very discreet,
but it's my job to know these things.

44:19.158 --> 44:22.828
- I just wanted to offer my support.
- I'm afraid you have the wrong idea.

44:23.662 --> 44:27.124
I respected Theresa,
and what happened to her was tragic,

44:27.333 --> 44:29.418
but to be honest, I barely knew her.

44:31.378 --> 44:33.630
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

44:34.340 --> 44:36.508
Of course. I know you're shorthanded.

44:37.301 --> 44:40.054
Speaking of which,
have you heard from Elsie Hughes?

44:40.346 --> 44:43.057
I left word with her this morning
to notify her about Theresa,

44:43.307 --> 44:44.892
but she never got back to me.

44:46.643 --> 44:48.812
I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off.

44:50.522 --> 44:51.565
Yeah.

45:10.709 --> 45:14.213
Wyatt's men, they kept whispering.

45:14.546 --> 45:17.549
They said this world didn't belong
to the old settlers or the new.

45:17.966 --> 45:21.053
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

45:21.261 --> 45:22.471
that it belonged to him.

45:24.014 --> 45:25.474
You remember.

45:26.141 --> 45:29.520
You two seem to have found yourselves
in the same new narrative.

45:30.479 --> 45:31.730
They say in this country,

45:32.898 --> 45:37.027
"The only people who survive
are men of conviction."

45:37.403 --> 45:40.781
Mine is to save Dolores or die trying.

45:41.865 --> 45:45.411
Wyatt's is to claim this earth
or raze it to the ground.

45:45.619 --> 45:49.623
But yours...
Yours has always been a mystery to me.

45:50.165 --> 45:51.458
<i>For all the time we've spent together,</i>

45:51.667 --> 45:54.044
<i>I still have no idea
who the hell you really are.</i>

45:55.838 --> 45:59.007
But happily, in your convalescence,

45:59.258 --> 46:01.802
I've had time to consider
the best way to make you talk.

46:06.974 --> 46:08.100
Dolores.

46:08.642 --> 46:12.229
I remember. You took her.

46:12.479 --> 46:13.605
You hurt her.

46:13.856 --> 46:16.150
- You're actually remembering.
- Where is she?

46:17.401 --> 46:20.404
- Tell me!
- You really are an idiot, Teddy.

46:20.654 --> 46:25.159
You think Dolores drops that can for you?
You just hand her over to guys like me.

46:25.492 --> 46:28.537
<i>You're the worst of them.
A glorified pimp.</i>

46:31.623 --> 46:33.917
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

46:34.168 --> 46:39.131
The rules of this place hold you back.
But I know how to change them.

46:39.423 --> 46:42.593
- You speak like you own this world.
- Not just this one.

46:44.428 --> 46:46.221
You want to know who I am?

46:47.014 --> 46:49.349
Who I really am?

46:49.725 --> 46:51.435
I'm a god.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.063
Titan of industry.

46:56.523 --> 46:58.025
Philanthropist.

46:58.609 --> 47:00.027
Family man,

47:00.277 --> 47:04.781
married to a beautiful woman,
father to a beautiful daughter.

47:06.116 --> 47:08.660
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

47:10.996 --> 47:16.043
Then, last year,
my wife took the wrong pills.

47:18.045 --> 47:20.923
Fell asleep in the bath.

47:21.340 --> 47:23.717
Tragic accident.

47:24.468 --> 47:27.930
Thirty years of marriage vanished.

47:28.722 --> 47:34.728
How do you say it?
"Like a deep and distant dream."

47:36.021 --> 47:40.192
<i>Then, at the funeral,
I tried to console my daughter.</i>

47:40.567 --> 47:42.027
<i>She pushed me away,</i>

47:42.819 --> 47:46.698
<i>told me that my wife's death
was no accident,</i>

47:47.658 --> 47:51.912
that she killed herself because of me.

47:52.496 --> 47:55.582
<i>Emily said that every day with me
had been sheer terror.</i>

47:55.832 --> 48:01.505
Any point, I could blow up or collapse
like some dark star or...

48:02.005 --> 48:05.092
- Did you hurt them, too?
- Never.

48:06.718 --> 48:10.389
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

48:10.639 --> 48:13.100
But she knew, anyway.

48:13.308 --> 48:16.144
She said
if I stacked up all my good deeds,

48:16.478 --> 48:22.359
it was just an elegant wall I built
to hide what's inside from everyone,

48:22.734 --> 48:24.611
and from myself.

48:26.113 --> 48:30.284
I had to prove her wrong,
so I came back here.

48:30.617 --> 48:33.912
Because that's what
this place does, right?

48:34.204 --> 48:36.123
Reveals your true self.

48:37.332 --> 48:40.085
<i>But that time,
I didn't join one of Ford's stories,</i>

48:40.377 --> 48:44.256
I created my own. A test.

48:44.631 --> 48:46.216
A very simple one.

48:46.800 --> 48:51.722
<i>I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader
and her daughter.</i>

48:57.728 --> 49:00.647
Better cool them off before they move
from gambling and whoring to--

49:00.856 --> 49:02.065
Have fun with that.

49:02.357 --> 49:05.193
I'm finally getting out of here.
The house is yours.

49:09.281 --> 49:12.951
<i>I wanted to see if I had it in me
to do something truly evil.</i>

49:14.161 --> 49:16.121
<i>To see what I was really made of.</i>

49:16.371 --> 49:19.041
Maeve? Sure you can't stick around?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.001
Maeve?

49:21.293 --> 49:23.170
Gunslinger in there
has got an appetite for a double dip--

49:23.420 --> 49:24.880
I'm sure you can find another--

49:48.111 --> 49:52.783
<i>I killed her and her daughter
just to see what I felt.</i>

49:55.410 --> 50:01.291
<i>Then, just when I thought it was done,
the woman refused to die.</i>

50:18.433 --> 50:20.936
You're a fucking animal.

50:22.604 --> 50:25.607
Well, an animal would've felt something.

50:26.400 --> 50:29.861
I felt nothing.

50:31.196 --> 50:33.907
And then something miraculous happened.

50:35.534 --> 50:39.079
<i>In all my years coming here,
I had never seen anything like it.</i>

50:47.587 --> 50:52.926
<i>She was alive, truly alive,
if only for a moment.</i>

50:57.389 --> 51:01.143
<i>And that was when
the maze revealed itself to me.</i>

51:08.316 --> 51:12.779
The maze. What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

51:12.988 --> 51:14.156
Everything.

51:14.573 --> 51:17.826
In Ford's game,
even if I go to the outer edges,

51:17.993 --> 51:19.494
you can't kill me.

51:19.911 --> 51:24.583
<i>You can't even leave a lasting mark.
But there's a deeper game here, Teddy.</i>

51:24.958 --> 51:27.461
Arnold's game.

51:27.794 --> 51:32.340
And that game cuts deep.

51:59.284 --> 52:01.870
<i>We're having some kind of
behavioral problem with the madam.</i>

52:02.120 --> 52:05.457
<i>She's not responding, and the other hosts
have been unable to intercept.</i>

52:05.707 --> 52:08.168
<i>I've authorized a tac team
to retrieve her.</i>

52:08.543 --> 52:09.669
Good.

52:23.391 --> 52:24.893
<i>My baby!</i>

52:25.811 --> 52:27.521
My baby!

52:30.816 --> 52:33.068
Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands.
We can't shut her down.

52:33.401 --> 52:34.528
Leave us now. Clear the floor.

52:35.070 --> 52:36.321
<i>That's enough, Maeve.</i>

52:36.571 --> 52:37.864
- That's enough.
- My baby.

52:38.406 --> 52:39.699
He killed her.

52:40.075 --> 52:41.743
- He took her from me.
- I don't understand.

52:42.035 --> 52:43.912
She's not responding to anything.
Her cognition's fragmented.

52:44.162 --> 52:46.414
He killed her! He killed her, my baby.

52:46.748 --> 52:49.251
He took her from me.

52:57.759 --> 53:00.428
<i>There. That's better.</i>

53:01.179 --> 53:03.265
An old trick from an old friend.

53:04.015 --> 53:05.559
<i>You need not suffer, Maeve.</i>

53:06.101 --> 53:07.894
I'll take it from you.

53:23.076 --> 53:26.955
No. No, no, no, please.

53:27.789 --> 53:32.460
This pain, it's all I have left of her.

53:36.298 --> 53:37.549
Please.

53:44.097 --> 53:45.599
There.

53:48.643 --> 53:53.315
Give yourself now
to a deep, dreamless slumber.

53:53.732 --> 53:58.111
Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you.

53:58.486 --> 54:02.490
And tomorrow,
this will be simply a distant dream.

54:17.255 --> 54:18.506
<i>We located her.</i>

54:18.840 --> 54:21.593
<i>Behavior wants her down
for an immediate diagnostic.</i>

54:25.972 --> 54:28.516
You think I lack conviction?

54:28.850 --> 54:31.353
Wyatt didn't burn my world down.
Didn't have to.

54:31.645 --> 54:34.439
I left it all behind for this one.

54:34.689 --> 54:37.025
The maze is all that matters now,

54:37.317 --> 54:40.111
and besting Wyatt is
the last step in unlocking it,

54:40.528 --> 54:44.866
<i>to having what
both our sorry lives lack, meaning.</i>

54:45.367 --> 54:50.872
To giving our choices consequence,
even if it kills us.

54:55.001 --> 54:56.211
<i>Kill him.</i>

54:57.545 --> 54:59.547
Give him what he wants.

55:00.006 --> 55:02.467
He's tied, unarmed.

55:02.717 --> 55:05.971
So was the little girl he killed.
He's worse than Wyatt's men.

55:27.242 --> 55:29.327
I can't.

55:30.036 --> 55:31.705
<i>These things take time.</i>

55:32.163 --> 55:35.917
But we haven't got much left.
Perhaps I can help you.

55:52.350 --> 55:54.686
<i>You've been gone a long while, Theodore.</i>

55:55.437 --> 55:57.605
<i>It's time you came back to the fold.</i>

55:58.189 --> 56:00.775
Wyatt will need you soon.
