WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:06.008
Check it out, guys.

00:06.010 --> 00:08.943
Look who's gonna be a
high school graduate.

00:08.946 --> 00:10.812
Proved you wrong, huh, Mr. Kolb?

00:10.814 --> 00:12.681
I guess pigs can fly.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.819
Well, the look works
for you, buddy.

00:17.821 --> 00:20.389
Ugh. So drab.

00:20.391 --> 00:23.225
I took the liberty of making
a few changes to mine.

00:25.995 --> 00:28.230
Me too. For out of towners
that can't make it,

00:28.232 --> 00:30.265
I'll be live streaming
the whole ceremony...

00:31.634 --> 00:33.035
From my tassel cam.

00:33.037 --> 00:35.070
Extreme graduation.

00:36.506 --> 00:38.040
Nostril zoom.

00:40.343 --> 00:41.910
Oh, snot boulder ahead.

00:41.912 --> 00:43.178
Want me to get that for you?

00:43.180 --> 00:45.247
Uh, no, thanks, Dez.

00:45.249 --> 00:47.215
This is unbelievable.

00:47.217 --> 00:49.651
They won't let me pick
up my cap and gown.

00:49.653 --> 00:51.987
Apparently I have an
overdue library book

00:51.989 --> 00:54.089
from freshman year
that I never returned.

00:54.091 --> 00:55.657
So return it?

00:55.659 --> 00:57.359
I don't know where it is.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.927
It's been four years.

00:58.929 --> 01:00.529
If I don't return that book,

01:00.531 --> 01:03.165
they won't let me participate
in the graduation ceremony.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.367
And I'm supposed to give the
biggest speech of my life

01:05.369 --> 01:07.202
in front of all of my
friends and family

01:07.204 --> 01:09.204
leaving a legacy that
will pave my way

01:09.206 --> 01:12.007
to being President of the
United States of America!

01:13.609 --> 01:15.343
Extreme loser cam.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

02:14.470 --> 02:15.804
- Trish!
- Aah!

02:15.806 --> 02:17.639
X plus y equals y times q.

02:19.175 --> 02:21.409
Wait. What time is it?

02:21.411 --> 02:22.811
Is algebra over?

02:22.813 --> 02:24.746
Yeah. About three hours ago.

02:26.055 --> 02:27.616
The yearbook committee's
about to meet.

02:27.618 --> 02:29.151
Wanna see the layout?

02:29.153 --> 02:30.585
Not so fast, red.

02:32.523 --> 02:35.157
Did you clear that with the
rest of the yearbook committee?

02:35.159 --> 02:37.492
I.E., me?

02:39.162 --> 02:40.262
Chuck?

02:40.264 --> 02:42.330
You two are in the
committee together?

02:42.332 --> 02:46.701
We put aside our differences in the
interest of creating a great yearbook.

02:46.703 --> 02:47.769
Yeah.

02:47.771 --> 02:50.105
I decided to be the better man.

02:50.107 --> 02:53.542
Actually, I'm the
better better man.

02:53.544 --> 02:54.809
Oh, yeah?

02:54.811 --> 02:58.613
Well, I'm so much better that
instead of a best man at a wedding,

02:58.615 --> 03:00.182
they have a Chuck man.

03:01.551 --> 03:02.984
Oh, yeah?

03:02.986 --> 03:06.821
I'm so much better, that instead
of a dog winning "best in show",

03:06.823 --> 03:08.290
they win "Dez in show."

03:09.525 --> 03:10.692
Oh, yeah?

03:10.694 --> 03:15.530
Well, I'm so much better, that instead
of B.F.F.S, they have C.F.F.S,

03:16.465 --> 03:17.732
Chuck friends forever.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.336
I'll settle this.

03:21.338 --> 03:22.571
You're both the worst.

03:22.573 --> 03:24.539
Let me see this yearbook layout.

03:26.976 --> 03:30.545
Other people, other
people, not me.

03:30.547 --> 03:32.147
Hey.

03:32.149 --> 03:35.350
There's only one picture of me in
the entire activities section.

03:35.352 --> 03:37.085
And I'm napping.

03:37.087 --> 03:39.054
Well, it is your
favorite activity.

03:39.056 --> 03:41.690
I should be all
over this yearbook.

03:41.692 --> 03:44.859
You guys are gonna have to take
a bunch of new pictures of me.

03:44.861 --> 03:46.394
Okay.

03:46.396 --> 03:49.831
But I gotta warn you, the
ladies who pose for me

03:49.833 --> 03:52.334
often fall madly
in love with me.

03:53.402 --> 03:54.769
Yeah, I'll take my chances.

03:58.574 --> 03:59.774
Oh, hey, Ally.

03:59.776 --> 04:01.676
Is that that library book
you were looking for?

04:01.678 --> 04:03.845
No, but I figured out
what happened to it.

04:06.616 --> 04:09.117
This is my daily planner
from freshman year.

04:11.254 --> 04:13.121
Hey, it's my name.

04:13.123 --> 04:15.490
Aww, and it has a
little star next to it.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.459
That's an asterisk.

04:19.362 --> 04:21.228
It corresponds to this
note at the bottom

04:21.231 --> 04:23.865
that says you borrowed the
library book I'm missing.

04:25.568 --> 04:28.036
Why would I borrow some
book on medieval history?

04:29.205 --> 04:31.006
Wait, why would I borrow a book?

04:32.275 --> 04:33.575
It was for a class.

04:33.577 --> 04:36.778
I lent it to you and
you never returned it.

04:36.780 --> 04:39.781
You have to find it or I won't
be able to go to graduation.

04:39.783 --> 04:42.317
You know, Ally, this
just proves once again

04:42.319 --> 04:44.152
nothing good ever
comes from reading.

04:45.087 --> 04:46.321
Just find it!

04:47.490 --> 04:49.224
Go! Go go go go go!

04:52.261 --> 04:55.163
Dez, I searched my whole house
and Ally's book isn't there.

04:55.165 --> 04:56.931
But I did find this in
the lost and found.

04:56.933 --> 04:58.933
It's my old backpack
from freshman year.

04:58.935 --> 05:00.335
Ew.

05:00.337 --> 05:02.404
My old lunch from freshman year.

05:03.339 --> 05:05.240
Ooh, green flavored donut.

05:05.242 --> 05:06.641
I love vintage food.

05:09.912 --> 05:12.480
This is the backpack I had
when I borrowed Ally's book.

05:12.482 --> 05:13.482
It has to be in here.

05:14.350 --> 05:15.984
Are donuts supposed
to have tails?

05:18.654 --> 05:22.590
Hairspray, hair gel,
hair mousse, hairbrush.

05:23.526 --> 05:24.993
Oh man, no book!

05:24.995 --> 05:26.528
Ally's gonna kill me!

05:26.530 --> 05:27.862
Ooh, can I have that hair brush?

05:34.270 --> 05:35.503
Austin, there you are.

05:35.505 --> 05:37.272
Please tell me you
found the book.

05:37.274 --> 05:43.011
Uhh... As a matter of fact,
I did find your book.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.180
It was in this old backpack.

05:45.182 --> 05:46.381
Oh, that is great.

05:46.383 --> 05:47.682
What a relief.

05:47.684 --> 05:51.453
I was so worried that you wouldn't find
it and my graduation would be ruined.

05:51.455 --> 05:53.688
Yeah, that would be terrible.

05:53.690 --> 05:56.391
So give me the book,
and I'll go return it.

05:56.393 --> 05:58.293
You can't do that because...

05:58.295 --> 06:00.428
I already returned it for you.

06:00.430 --> 06:02.030
Oh.

06:02.032 --> 06:04.132
Thank you. You're the best.

06:06.135 --> 06:08.503
Well, I guess I can go pick
up my cap and gown now.

06:08.505 --> 06:11.506
You can't do that
either because I...

06:11.508 --> 06:13.308
Also picked that up for you.

06:14.977 --> 06:16.544
It looks kind of big.

06:16.546 --> 06:17.645
Well, it was the last one.

06:17.647 --> 06:20.081
Really? When I was there
they had hundreds...

06:20.083 --> 06:21.316
the last one.

06:21.318 --> 06:22.984
That's okay.

06:22.986 --> 06:24.652
I am just happy to have it.

06:26.555 --> 06:28.156
Austin.

06:28.158 --> 06:29.924
I can't believe you would
lie to me like that.

06:29.926 --> 06:31.860
You told me you didn't
find Ally's book.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.662
I didn't. I was lying to Ally.

06:34.664 --> 06:36.164
I couldn't tell her the truth.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.232
Oh, I can.

06:37.234 --> 06:38.500
- Ally!
- Shh!

06:39.702 --> 06:41.469
I have a plan to get the book.

06:42.505 --> 06:45.073
I'll just order
another copy online.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.408
Okay, here it is.

06:47.410 --> 06:48.410
"Out of print"?

06:48.412 --> 06:50.845
Oh no, there are no
copies available.

06:50.847 --> 06:52.781
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

06:52.783 --> 06:54.916
You're still young
and good-looking.

06:54.918 --> 06:57.085
What does that have to do
with getting the book?

06:57.087 --> 07:00.355
Nothing. It just means you can get a
new girlfriend when Ally dumps you.

07:10.266 --> 07:11.933
Dez, great news.

07:11.935 --> 07:14.969
Someone's auctioning a copy of
Ally's missing library book.

07:14.971 --> 07:18.706
Ooh, look! They're also selling an
original my tiny tiger figurine.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.074
Oh, I love this one.

07:20.076 --> 07:21.843
It's rainbow roar.

07:22.878 --> 07:23.912
I'm gonna put in a bid.

07:23.914 --> 07:25.046
Dez!

07:25.048 --> 07:26.581
I have to keep an
eye on the auction

07:26.583 --> 07:28.650
to make sure no one outbids
me at the last minute.

07:28.652 --> 07:31.286
Besides, rainbow roar is lame.

07:31.288 --> 07:33.455
Everyone knows bengal
beauty's the best.

07:35.558 --> 07:36.624
That's your opinion.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.561
Anyway, I've got to finish
setting up the green screen.

07:39.563 --> 07:42.163
Chuck and I are shooting some
yearbook photos for Trish.

07:42.165 --> 07:44.599
She wants it to look like she's
on all the school teams.

07:44.601 --> 07:46.935
Guess who's on the tennis team.

07:46.937 --> 07:48.803
And every other team.

07:49.738 --> 07:52.273
Trish, why do you even care
if you're on a sports team?

07:52.275 --> 07:54.642
I'm gonna show this yearbook
to my kids someday.

07:54.644 --> 07:56.144
And I don't want them
to think I was some

07:56.146 --> 07:58.413
lazy slacker that didn't
participate in anything.

07:58.415 --> 08:00.448
So you're gonna lie to them?

08:00.450 --> 08:01.516
Yeah.

08:01.518 --> 08:04.686
You lie about your mistakes so your
children don't make the same ones.

08:04.688 --> 08:06.009
At least that's
what my dad said.

08:06.789 --> 08:08.189
Though he could have been lying.

08:09.258 --> 08:11.259
Okay. Enough chit-chat.

08:11.261 --> 08:13.161
Swing that racket, trishy-kins.

08:14.663 --> 08:16.598
Good, good.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.334
Game, set, beautiful.

08:22.838 --> 08:26.241
Two, four, six, eight, Chuck
is making you look great.

08:28.878 --> 08:30.411
Hop for me, snow bunny.

08:32.347 --> 08:33.515
We live in Miami.

08:33.517 --> 08:34.782
We don't have a ski team.

08:34.784 --> 08:36.183
We do now.

08:36.186 --> 08:38.520
That hat looks adorable on her.

08:44.025 --> 08:47.195
In the interest of keeping this
professional, I have to ask,

08:48.130 --> 08:49.397
are you loving on me yet?

08:51.233 --> 08:53.902
If I was in love with you, would I
feel like throwing up right now?

08:54.870 --> 08:56.337
Possibly.

08:56.339 --> 08:58.606
Every lady reacts differently.

09:01.544 --> 09:03.745
15 more seconds and
the book is mine.

09:03.747 --> 09:06.781
Okay, now let me see you throw
the winning touchdown pass.

09:07.816 --> 09:09.817
10, nine...

09:09.819 --> 09:11.386
oh no, someone just outbid me.

09:11.388 --> 09:12.720
Go long!

09:14.690 --> 09:15.757
Dez!

09:16.825 --> 09:17.926
What did you just do?

09:18.861 --> 09:20.828
You just made me
lose the auction.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.864
And my computer's not working.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.500
Sorry. I'll buy you a
new computer online.

09:29.905 --> 09:31.139
Your computer's not working.

09:39.081 --> 09:41.382
I did it. I got it.
I got the book.

09:41.384 --> 09:42.951
How? I thought you
lost the auction.

09:42.953 --> 09:46.621
I did. But then I started calling
rare book sellers all over Florida,

09:46.623 --> 09:48.590
and I finally found a
copy in Tallahassee.

09:48.592 --> 09:50.692
Took me 12 hours to
drive there and back.

09:50.694 --> 09:52.594
Not including the 45
minute detour I made

09:52.596 --> 09:54.796
to see the world's
largest paper clip.

09:54.798 --> 09:55.964
Ooh. Was it cool?

09:55.966 --> 09:57.031
Yeah.

09:57.033 --> 09:58.900
And the gift shop
was the best part.

09:58.902 --> 10:03.304
They sell these mini world's largest
paper clips, and it was only 25 bucks.

10:04.607 --> 10:05.740
Aww.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.976
So much cooler than a
regular paper clip.

10:10.045 --> 10:12.046
Anyway, now I just need
to return this book

10:12.048 --> 10:13.815
to the library before
Ally finds out.

10:13.817 --> 10:15.149
Before Ally finds out what?

10:16.085 --> 10:17.552
Uh...

10:17.554 --> 10:18.720
Hey, Ally.

10:18.722 --> 10:22.724
I just didn't want you
to find out that I...

10:22.726 --> 10:25.460
Got you a really great
graduation present.

10:25.462 --> 10:27.895
Oh, that is so sweet.

10:27.897 --> 10:29.664
Wait, we're buying
each other gifts now?

10:30.899 --> 10:33.768
Hey, who wants to hear
me rehearse my speech?

10:33.770 --> 10:36.070
Ooh, does it have a
lot of words in it?

10:36.072 --> 10:37.805
'Cause if so, no.

10:37.807 --> 10:39.073
Okay.

10:39.075 --> 10:40.708
Austin will listen to it then.

10:41.844 --> 10:42.910
You ready, Trish?

10:44.413 --> 10:46.481
Hey, which do you think
brings out my eyes more?

10:46.483 --> 10:48.916
The test tube or the petri dish?

10:48.918 --> 10:50.818
Uh...

10:50.820 --> 10:51.886
Neither.

10:54.923 --> 10:58.292
"So as we go forth into this
world of uncertainty..."

10:58.294 --> 11:01.596
I'm thinking I'll start
tearing up right about here.

11:01.598 --> 11:02.764
Austin!

11:03.766 --> 11:05.433
Can I talk to you for a sec?

11:05.435 --> 11:08.703
Trish may have accidentally spilled
a little something on the book.

11:08.705 --> 11:10.772
But don't worry, it
was just a tiny drop.

11:12.608 --> 11:14.342
Of incredibly corrosive acid.

11:15.511 --> 11:17.645
Why were you even
using real acid?

11:17.647 --> 11:18.846
It was just for a photo.

11:20.016 --> 11:21.382
How dare you.

11:22.518 --> 11:24.719
My photography is a
reflection of reality.

11:24.721 --> 11:27.455
I'm not some hack like Chuck.
I would never fake it.

11:27.457 --> 11:29.757
This whole photo shoot is fake!

11:31.827 --> 11:33.461
What's the big deal anyway?

11:33.463 --> 11:34.862
I thought you already
returned the book?

11:34.864 --> 11:35.863
I lied, okay?

11:35.865 --> 11:37.899
I just needed more
time to find it.

11:37.901 --> 11:40.868
Ooh, you in trouble.

11:41.804 --> 11:43.071
Well, now what?

11:43.073 --> 11:44.739
If I don't get the book
back to the library

11:44.741 --> 11:47.809
Ally won't be able to go to graduation,
she'll never speak to me again,

11:47.811 --> 11:50.478
and she'll never be the president
of the United States of America!

11:52.014 --> 11:53.648
On the bright side,

11:53.650 --> 11:56.784
no one will have to listen to her
long, boring graduation speech.

12:03.992 --> 12:06.427
How am I gonna tell Ally I
can't find the library book?

12:06.429 --> 12:08.429
Graduation means
everything to her.

12:08.431 --> 12:10.765
You're gonna be in trouble.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.468
Stop saying that.

12:15.237 --> 12:16.504
I've got a great idea.

12:17.439 --> 12:20.775
If we destroy the school,
then no one can graduate

12:20.777 --> 12:22.310
and she won't be
missing anything.

12:23.378 --> 12:27.915
Except for her best friends, who will
be in prison for destroying the school.

12:28.784 --> 12:31.786
You know, it's easy
to poke holes.

12:33.388 --> 12:35.790
Well, this sounds
like a you problem.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.192
Can we get back to staging
my fake yearbook photos?

12:40.129 --> 12:41.262
That's it.

12:41.264 --> 12:43.197
You've been faking all
your yearbook photos,

12:43.199 --> 12:46.534
so why can't we put on a
fake graduation for Ally?

12:46.536 --> 12:47.902
That could work.

12:47.904 --> 12:49.871
I mean, it'd be kind of like
setting up a movie shoot.

12:49.873 --> 12:50.780
Yeah.

12:50.811 --> 12:54.408
What if you shoot a
graduation themed music video

12:54.410 --> 12:56.077
and invite the whole
school to be in it?

12:56.079 --> 12:57.712
Ooh, what's our budget?

12:57.714 --> 13:00.882
Do you think we could afford
Channing Tatum to be the principal?

13:02.885 --> 13:05.219
Ally's gonna know Channing
Tatum isn't our principal.

13:05.221 --> 13:06.821
I know, but come on.

13:06.823 --> 13:08.890
Channing Tatum.

13:08.892 --> 13:11.159
Guys, focus on the plan.

13:11.161 --> 13:13.261
Now, we're gonna have
to do this on Saturday

13:13.263 --> 13:15.596
because actual
graduation is on Sunday.

13:15.598 --> 13:19.000
But Ally's never gonna believe they
changed the date of graduation.

13:19.002 --> 13:21.903
So we just have to convince
Ally that Saturday is Sunday.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.305
I see where you're
going with this.

13:24.307 --> 13:27.975
We get Ally to stay up late so
she's confused when she wakes up.

13:27.977 --> 13:31.579
Then we change all the clocks so she
thinks she slept for a whole day.

13:31.581 --> 13:34.148
Right. And while she's sleeping,
we draw a mustache on her face

13:34.150 --> 13:35.316
with permanent marker.

13:36.451 --> 13:37.552
Great plan, guys.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.261
Okay, here's the plan.

13:47.263 --> 13:49.030
Ally's in there
practicing her speech.

13:49.032 --> 13:50.832
We're gonna take turns
keeping her up.

13:50.834 --> 13:54.335
No matter what, we can't let her
fall asleep until at least midnight.

13:54.337 --> 13:55.670
Okay. I'll go first.

14:02.418 --> 14:04.378
I couldn't think of anything
to talk to her about.

14:04.380 --> 14:05.446
I give up.

14:09.818 --> 14:13.688
"So in conclusion," the little
girl who found that seashell

14:13.690 --> 14:18.025
"is ready to dive into
that great big ocean."

14:18.961 --> 14:20.027
Wow.

14:20.029 --> 14:21.362
That was great.

14:21.364 --> 14:23.231
Why don't you read
it one more time?

14:23.233 --> 14:24.799
Really?

14:24.801 --> 14:27.168
I've already read it
to you like 25 times.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.903
You must really like it.

14:28.905 --> 14:31.439
I just love it so much.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.642
Aww.

14:34.644 --> 14:35.776
"Fellow graduates,

14:37.479 --> 14:39.247
as we gather here today..."

14:44.486 --> 14:45.553
Austin.

14:46.922 --> 14:49.023
Why are we jogging
in place again?

14:49.025 --> 14:52.493
It's a great way to clear your mind
so you can focus on your speech.

14:52.495 --> 14:56.998
I could also focus on my speech
by focusing on my speech.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Come on. Just another...

14:59.002 --> 15:00.768
Hour and 15 minutes.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.208
Okay.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.542
It's midnight now.

15:08.544 --> 15:09.911
We can stop.

15:20.222 --> 15:21.322
Guys.

15:25.594 --> 15:27.835
She fell asleep. It's time for
the next part of the plan.

15:41.276 --> 15:43.477
Dez, what are you doing?

15:43.479 --> 15:45.246
Drawing a mustache
on Ally's face.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.014
Isn't that part of the plan?

15:52.120 --> 15:53.154
Okay.

15:53.156 --> 15:57.058
We've reset all the clocks, phones,
and computers in the music factory.

15:57.060 --> 16:00.494
Oh, and Austin just texted saying
everything's in place for the video shoot.

16:00.496 --> 16:02.129
Time to wake up Ally.

16:07.069 --> 16:08.102
Dez.

16:08.104 --> 16:10.037
Relax. It's just a stick on.

16:11.273 --> 16:12.807
Aah!

16:12.809 --> 16:14.175
What was that?

16:14.177 --> 16:15.576
Ally, what are you
doing still sleeping?

16:15.578 --> 16:17.078
We've got to get to graduation.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.112
What?

16:18.114 --> 16:19.413
Graduation?

16:19.415 --> 16:20.982
But it's Saturday.

16:20.984 --> 16:23.084
No. You slept through Saturday.

16:23.086 --> 16:26.053
It's Sunday now. And any calendar,
clock, or t-shirt will confirm that.

16:27.255 --> 16:28.689
Come on. Hurry.

16:28.691 --> 16:29.991
You don't want to
miss the ceremony.

16:29.993 --> 16:34.161
I haven't even had a chance to get ready.
Do I look okay?

16:34.163 --> 16:35.163
Nope.

16:39.201 --> 16:41.002
Hey, everyone. I want to
thank you all so much

16:41.004 --> 16:42.670
for being a part
of my new video.

16:46.274 --> 16:49.010
I expect my dancing
will be featured.

16:49.012 --> 16:50.511
I've got some good moves.

17:00.156 --> 17:02.890
No. I want this to look
like a real graduation.

17:02.892 --> 17:05.291
I need you to do exactly what
you're gonna do tomorrow.

17:05.294 --> 17:08.729
Yeah, that was exactly what
I was gonna do tomorrow.

17:11.165 --> 17:13.067
Ally! Thank goodness
you're here.

17:13.069 --> 17:14.135
It's time for your speech.

17:14.137 --> 17:15.368
Yeah, you'd better
get up on stage.

17:15.371 --> 17:17.505
Isn't the principal
going to introduce me?

17:17.507 --> 17:19.040
Uh...

17:19.041 --> 17:21.709
He said you need
no introduction.

17:27.848 --> 17:32.253
Fellow graduates, as we gather to take
this momentous step in our lives,

17:32.255 --> 17:36.090
let us look back on the last
four years and most importantly,

17:36.092 --> 17:37.658
the friendships we've made.

17:37.660 --> 17:41.429
Those friendships teach us
about trust and honesty,

17:41.431 --> 17:44.231
about coming through when
someone is counting on you,

17:44.233 --> 17:48.736
and not keeping secrets, or blatantly
lying to your friend's face.

17:48.738 --> 17:53.074
And as Abraham Lincoln once said,
also known as honest Abe...

17:53.076 --> 17:54.508
I didn't return the book.

17:56.078 --> 17:57.978
Abraham Lincoln said that?

17:59.047 --> 18:00.128
I thought it was Roosevelt.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.685
I couldn't find it, and I
didn't want you to be mad,

18:04.687 --> 18:05.953
so I lied to buy more time.

18:05.955 --> 18:08.722
So then I finally found a copy, but
then Trish and Dez spilled acid on it,

18:08.724 --> 18:10.257
and then I made up this
whole fake graduation

18:10.259 --> 18:12.293
and I made you believe
you slept a whole day,

18:12.295 --> 18:14.536
and this whole thing is a lie.
And now I'm out of breath.

18:15.363 --> 18:16.864
Ally, I'm so sorry.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.106
So you're not mad at me?

18:25.108 --> 18:29.276
Well, I was mad when I
found out you lied.

18:29.278 --> 18:30.945
But...

18:30.947 --> 18:33.147
I'm happy you
finally came clean.

18:33.149 --> 18:36.650
And I figure anyone who would
go to this much trouble

18:36.652 --> 18:40.221
to set up a fake graduation
must really care about me.

18:42.257 --> 18:43.924
So you knew I didn't
return the book?

18:43.926 --> 18:44.992
Yeah.

18:44.994 --> 18:46.794
I know when you're lying.

18:47.963 --> 18:50.083
Also the cap and gown you
gave me had your name in it.

18:52.167 --> 18:55.503
Ally, I'm so sorry you can't be a
part of the real graduation ceremony.

18:55.505 --> 18:57.171
Oh.

18:57.173 --> 18:58.272
I can.

18:58.274 --> 19:00.508
I just had to pay a fine.

19:00.510 --> 19:01.909
You owe me seven dollars.

19:03.411 --> 19:04.845
Seven dollars?

19:04.847 --> 19:05.946
That's it?

19:05.948 --> 19:08.349
Are we shooting a
music video or what?

21:00.895 --> 21:02.896
Real graduation was awesome.

21:02.898 --> 21:04.298
Eh, I don't know.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.461
After the fake one, the real
one was kind of a letdown.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.036
Do you think everyone
liked my speech?

21:09.038 --> 21:10.771
No idea. I was dead asleep.

21:12.941 --> 21:14.475
Hey, fellow graduates.

21:14.477 --> 21:16.278
Just stopped by so you
could sign my yearbook.

21:16.279 --> 21:18.979
Whoa. That thing is huge.

21:19.981 --> 21:22.950
And this whole thing is
just pictures of Trish.

21:22.952 --> 21:26.987
Trish on the homecoming float,
Trish in honors society.

21:27.922 --> 21:30.991
Wait, are you getting rescued
by Channing Tatum there?

21:32.994 --> 21:34.895
We may have gotten a
little carried away.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.567
I saved this page for
you, trishalicious.

21:43.471 --> 21:44.772
"Best couple"?

21:44.774 --> 21:46.073
We're not even dating.

21:47.075 --> 21:48.142
I know.

21:48.144 --> 21:51.812
But I wanted to tell my kids that I
dated the prettiest girl in school.

21:53.982 --> 21:55.482
You know what?

21:55.484 --> 21:58.585
I feel slightly less disgusted
by you than I normally do.

22:00.021 --> 22:01.422
And so it begins.

22:04.926 --> 22:06.193
Whatever.

22:06.195 --> 22:09.330
Did you see Austin and I
got voted "best bromance"?

22:10.465 --> 22:12.132
That isn't even a category.

22:12.134 --> 22:13.434
Yeah, I added it.

22:16.371 --> 22:17.531
What up?

22:24.212 --> 22:25.446
I said "slightly."
