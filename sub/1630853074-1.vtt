We need your help recovering Ehdan.

It's the richest kingdom in the world.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
And I want it.

Why dost thou crave my services?

Thou art a king with an army.

[Cromwell] Four times I've been defeated

Xusia of Delos.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.833
Thou shalt have thy kingdom,

We mustn't keep everyone waiting.

The nightmares,

09:26.958 --> 09:28.792
What did Amilious tell you about them?

09:30.167 --> 09:31.167
He said...

09:33.792 --> 09:37.417
What he said was that
it's too much of this kingly life.

Half of his army lay rotting before us.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.750
We can now deal with the good king

10:07.917 --> 10:09.417
without the aid of a sorcerer.

10:10.417 --> 10:13.625
Besides, if we don't kill Xusia now

10:13.792 --> 10:15.792
while he's still weak from his conjuring,

10:15.958 --> 10:17.458

The battle is lost.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.000
[man]
Arrangements have been made to crush

19:41.167 --> 19:42.500
Prince Mikah's rebellion.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.833
And to deliver Alana to
Cromwell for marriage.

19:47.583 --> 19:51.500
For eight years I have been
submerged in the Black Sea

19:51.667 --> 19:54.958
to heal the wounds of
Cromwell's treachery.

19:57.292 --> 20:00.542
After I slept, I conjured.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.583
And now,

20:03.375 --> 20:04.583
I shall conquer.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.583
In two days' time,

20:10.500 --> 20:12.458
with the rising of the seventh moon,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.083
Cromwell's power, Cromwell's bride,

20:18.792 --> 20:23.625
and Cromwell's flesh shall be mine!

20:24.000 --> 20:26.875
[dramatic music]

20:33.708 --> 20:36.625
[foreboding music]

20:54.208 --> 20:55.333
What do you want?

20:56.125 --> 20:57.917
Your generals have gathered
in the war room.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.625
They await instructions and
plans for the final conflict.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.250
You handle it.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.542
But sire, it is imperative--

21:06.708 --> 21:09.125
It is imperative that you obey my orders

21:09.833 --> 21:11.042
if you wish to live.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.708
[solemn music]

21:15.208 --> 21:16.292
Yes, my lord.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.292
Tell Cromwell not to worry.

21:22.458 --> 21:23.458
With him leading us,

21:23.625 --> 21:26.333
we will crush the rebellion and
capture Princess Alana.

21:27.083 --> 21:30.167
Unless your information about
the rebels proves false,

21:30.333 --> 21:31.583
Count Machelli.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.000
[tense music]

21:47.833 --> 21:50.750
[indistinct chattering]

21:53.708 --> 21:56.708
[man] Take these orders
and return to your men, Rodrigo.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.042
I will send word as to when
our rebellion begins.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.875
Yes, Prince Mikah.

22:03.042 --> 22:05.000
[bright music playing]

22:05.333 --> 22:07.333
[wind howling]

22:10.750 --> 22:12.542
[music stops]

22:16.167 --> 22:18.042
[man]
No animals allowed in here.

22:18.208 --> 22:19.500
Hush, Dolf.

22:19.667 --> 22:20.667
Quiet.

22:21.792 --> 22:23.292
- [door slamming]
- [Dolf gasps]

22:23.875 --> 22:25.375
You look like a thirsty lot.

22:25.917 --> 22:26.958
Bring us a bucket.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.167
[bartender]
A bucket, yes. [laughing]

22:29.333 --> 22:30.875
[indistinct chattering]

22:35.125 --> 22:38.708
If you warriors are looking for work,
you've come to the right place.

22:38.875 --> 22:39.958
[Talon] Why is that?

22:40.542 --> 22:42.833
The people in Ehdan are about to rebel.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.958
What kind of an animal are you?

22:46.458 --> 22:48.250
I can't quite tell.

22:48.417 --> 22:49.708
[bartender]
Here, you've had too much to drink.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.083
[men grunting]

22:51.250 --> 22:53.292
- [head slamming]
- [drunk groaning]

22:53.458 --> 22:55.417
- Go on.
- [chuckles]

22:56.417 --> 22:57.625
As I was saying,

22:58.083 --> 23:00.375
there are two bidders for your swords,

23:01.042 --> 23:02.833
King Cromwell the usurper,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.625
Lord Mikah, the last legitimate
heir to the throne.

23:07.375 --> 23:08.833
[Talon] What legitimate heir?

23:09.208 --> 23:12.042
[bartender] Mikah's father was
King Richard's closest advisor.

23:12.292 --> 23:13.833
The people believe him and his sister

23:14.000 --> 23:15.708
to be the rightful heirs.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.792
[man shouting]

23:36.875 --> 23:37.917
All is set, Mikah.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.333
Proceed as planned, tomorrow.

23:42.167 --> 23:43.500
Excellent, Count.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.833
Tomorrow the throne of Ehdan
shall belong to you,

23:47.750 --> 23:48.875
its legitimate heir.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.000
It's ironic that the people of Ehdan

23:52.167 --> 23:55.792
should owe their freedom to
Cromwell's poor chancellor.

23:56.250 --> 23:57.500
[Machelli]
They will owe me nothing, my friend.

23:58.292 --> 23:59.958
Justice is its own reward.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.083
You're a good man, Machelli.

24:04.250 --> 24:05.458
I must go now.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.083
You and I will have no further contact.

24:07.417 --> 24:08.500
It is no longer safe.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Machelli.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.125
You will be well rewarded for this.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.292
[tense music]

24:16.458 --> 24:17.458
Thank you.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.333
Your Majesty.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.292
[indistinct chattering]

24:50.875 --> 24:52.083
[knocking on door]

25:06.083 --> 25:08.250
Has my sister made it safely
into the city?

25:08.667 --> 25:10.250
[man] Yes, my Lord Mikah.

25:10.417 --> 25:12.792
The Princess Alana is waiting inside.

25:16.792 --> 25:17.792
[Mikah] Alana.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.958
It's good to see you sister.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.208
[Alana] Oh, Mikah.

25:26.833 --> 25:27.958
You're late.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.125
Now come and have a look.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.500
[Mikah]
A map of the castle's secret passages.

25:40.417 --> 25:41.500
Alana,

25:42.208 --> 25:43.458
how did you get this?

25:43.625 --> 25:46.292
Cromwell's whore Elizabeth
is partial to our cause.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.375
She pilfered them from Cromwell himself.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.708
With allies like these, how can we lose?

25:50.875 --> 25:51.958
[Alana] Yes, but what is he plotting?

25:52.125 --> 25:54.042
He's got all the neighboring
kings here and--

25:54.208 --> 25:55.833
Shh. It matters not.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.500
I've just come from
speaking with Machelli.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.833
The rebellion begins tomorrow.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.292
- Spread the word.
- [bright music]

26:05.375 --> 26:06.458
Quickly, now.

26:15.583 --> 26:16.833
I can hardly believe it.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.750
Tomorrow, I shall be king.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.333
The crown will be yours.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.083
Yes.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.875
But I'll not wear it, Alana.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.583
The crown belongs to the people.

26:31.583 --> 26:33.583
- [door crashing]
- [dramatic music]

26:39.042 --> 26:40.042
Cromwell.

26:40.875 --> 26:42.333
What have we here?

26:43.542 --> 26:45.083
A nest of cobras?

26:45.250 --> 26:47.375
There's only one snake in Ehdan, Cromwell.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.792
Is that you, Alana?

26:51.542 --> 26:53.792
I was hoping you weren't
a part of all this.

26:55.542 --> 26:56.625
Go warn the others!

26:56.792 --> 26:59.458
- [swords clashing]
- [Mikah] Guard!

26:59.708 --> 27:01.000
[man grunts]

27:01.875 --> 27:03.042
[man shouts]

27:03.625 --> 27:06.000
- [Alana shouting]
- Have at me, Mikah.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.250
Come on!

27:09.292 --> 27:10.625
[Mikah screams]

27:14.917 --> 27:19.625
Your rebellion is over!

27:22.042 --> 27:23.625
[groaning]

27:28.208 --> 27:29.458
Take him.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.375
[Mikah groaning]

27:42.417 --> 27:46.083
[foreboding music]

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
[suspenseful music]

28:01.042 --> 28:02.708
- [dog barking]
- No. Oh, no.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.958
[man] Oh, yes.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.833
- [grunting]
- [men laughing]

28:22.292 --> 28:25.042
Now I poke you with my dagger, huh?

28:28.167 --> 28:29.625
[suspenseful music]

28:29.792 --> 28:31.417
Not this time, slut.

28:32.292 --> 28:36.000
Ya got lucky with me outside,
you did. [laughing]

28:41.208 --> 28:44.208
I'm going to mount you like
you've never been.

28:45.667 --> 28:46.667
With what?

28:47.083 --> 28:48.667
[man grunting]

28:49.125 --> 28:51.500
She's a wild one, this one!

28:54.083 --> 28:55.417
[Alana yelling]

28:59.500 --> 29:01.625
[man] Let's have a look at your goods.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.250
Now.

29:05.583 --> 29:07.125
[Alana] No.

29:08.458 --> 29:11.000
- [man] My, what have we here?
- No!

29:13.583 --> 29:14.750
Take her down.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.083
No!

29:17.375 --> 29:18.917
- No!
- [fabric tearing]

29:19.083 --> 29:21.667
[bright music]

29:22.833 --> 29:24.333
Beat it, pig, or die.

29:25.750 --> 29:26.958
That's a small threat.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.708
That's a very small threat.

29:32.042 --> 29:33.875
Why, you scum!

29:35.333 --> 29:37.417
[shouting]

29:38.750 --> 29:40.000
[sword and shield clattering]

29:40.167 --> 29:41.458
[man shouts indistinctly]

29:43.667 --> 29:45.208
- [blow thuds]
- [man grunts]

29:50.375 --> 29:52.917
- [man groaning]
- [playful music]

29:55.583 --> 29:57.583
[Alana whimpering]

30:01.042 --> 30:04.333
[soft music]

30:26.042 --> 30:27.208
[Talon] Stop shaking.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.250
You're safe now.

30:33.542 --> 30:34.542
[knocking on door]

30:34.708 --> 30:37.292
[light music]

30:39.833 --> 30:41.083
Me lady.

30:47.167 --> 30:50.708
Caliba says your brother was
captured by Cromwell himself.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.875
We have to get the word out.

30:53.042 --> 30:54.167
No attack tomorrow.

30:55.667 --> 30:56.667
Right, this way.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.500
In here, me lady.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.500
Dates.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.250
No beef?

31:23.625 --> 31:24.833
[man] As you wish.

31:27.708 --> 31:30.167
Just a leg or
shall I bring the whole cow?

31:30.333 --> 31:31.333
A leg will do.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.250
Word is being passed.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.875
You Ehdanians know good wine.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.250
I didn't bring you here to get drunk.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.958
Why did you bring me here?

31:58.125 --> 31:59.500
Is your sword for hire?

32:02.292 --> 32:03.292
That depends.

32:03.958 --> 32:05.542
I would pay anything for it.

32:06.708 --> 32:09.125
Well if the price is right,
my sword is yours.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.792
Not so fast.

32:11.958 --> 32:13.125
Oh but my sword is poised.

32:13.292 --> 32:14.292
[table creaking]

32:14.458 --> 32:15.875
Nothing in life is free.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.083
First, a task.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.625
So what do you want, a throat cut?

32:24.083 --> 32:25.667
I want you to rescue my brother.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.875
And what am I to be paid?

32:31.375 --> 32:32.792
200 talons.

32:34.292 --> 32:35.958
That's not what I had in mind.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.333
500 talons.

32:41.708 --> 32:44.125
[soft music]

32:49.375 --> 32:50.583
All right.

32:51.917 --> 32:52.917
Anything you want.

32:55.292 --> 32:56.583
But only for one night.

32:59.708 --> 33:02.208
So tell me, where is this
brother of yours?

33:04.708 --> 33:06.208
He's in Cromwell's dungeons.

33:07.292 --> 33:08.708
Now you want me to snatch your brother

33:08.875 --> 33:11.250
from the king's dungeons for
one night with you?

33:12.042 --> 33:14.583
That's a slim bounty for such a task.

33:15.083 --> 33:16.542
- Why, you bastard!
- [hand slapping]

33:16.708 --> 33:19.458
[swelling music]

33:20.583 --> 33:21.833
All right.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.417
The life of your brother for
one night with you.

33:27.750 --> 33:30.167
I expect my bounty perfumed and pretty.

33:34.792 --> 33:38.708
Me lady, 50 of our people
have been trapped in Skull Cave

33:38.875 --> 33:41.000
by King Cromwell's Red Dragon archers.

33:41.167 --> 33:42.708
Is there anything we can do to help them?

33:42.875 --> 33:45.625
No, me lady.
Nothin' can save them now.

33:45.792 --> 33:48.292
Well we can't just sit by while
they're being butchered.

33:48.583 --> 33:49.583
What about you?

33:51.792 --> 33:52.792
Can you help us?

33:55.417 --> 33:56.875
What do you take me for?

33:57.333 --> 33:58.375
[man] 'Tis suicide.

33:58.542 --> 33:59.667
Quiet, Craccus.

34:00.292 --> 34:02.125
Risking his life is his profession.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.458
Risk,

34:03.625 --> 34:04.667
not throw away.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.917
What's the matter,
is your sword too small?

34:10.042 --> 34:12.375
And what am I to be paid for
this small chore, hm?

34:12.833 --> 34:14.958
You're being paid enough
for a thousand such tasks.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.417
Oh, I can't wait to bed you, wench.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.750
You raise my expectations.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.542
I'll rescue your rogues.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.292
First, I want a taste of your lips

34:32.000 --> 34:33.375
to send me to my grave.

34:33.542 --> 34:36.292
[romantic music]

34:51.167 --> 34:52.208
Brash hulk!

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Who is he?

34:56.333 --> 34:57.458
I don't know.

34:58.167 --> 35:01.208
Well at least you won't have to
pay your, uh, debt.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.875
He won't live to see the sunrise.

35:04.833 --> 35:07.500
- [door slamming]
- [dramatic music]

35:10.417 --> 35:11.417
[man shouting]

35:11.583 --> 35:12.708
[crashing]

35:12.875 --> 35:15.000
[Craccus] Go through the back,
me lady, quick!

35:15.375 --> 35:18.208
[Alana screaming]

35:27.208 --> 35:29.667
[music continues]

35:50.625 --> 35:52.667
Come out and live

35:54.250 --> 35:57.917
or stay and die!

36:02.583 --> 36:04.500
The choice is yours.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.875
You have five minutes to decide.

36:13.208 --> 36:14.375
Come, lads!

36:14.958 --> 36:17.958
Your rebellion is over!

36:19.000 --> 36:22.167
The king has your leader in chains.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.625
Give yourselves up.

36:28.292 --> 36:29.667
You heard the jackal.

36:30.667 --> 36:33.375
Do we fight or surrender?

36:33.667 --> 36:35.000
[tense music]

36:35.167 --> 36:37.750
Oil! They're pouring oil.

36:38.167 --> 36:41.125
- [suspenseful music]
- [oil splashing]

37:01.500 --> 37:04.292
[man shouting]

37:04.458 --> 37:07.042
[men cheering]

37:08.917 --> 37:11.000
[general] Get back there, scum!

37:12.250 --> 37:14.625
Stand by for torching!

37:14.792 --> 37:16.500
[dramatic music]

37:16.833 --> 37:17.833
Arrows,

37:18.583 --> 37:19.750
set!

37:24.208 --> 37:25.542
[man] Burn!

37:25.792 --> 37:28.042
[fire whooshing]

37:31.917 --> 37:34.333
[general]
All eyes on the cave!

37:34.583 --> 37:37.750
Not a single rebel is to escape.

37:37.917 --> 37:40.208
[fire whooshing]

37:48.792 --> 37:51.625
This is your final chance!

37:54.667 --> 37:57.583
Surrender or roast!

37:58.292 --> 38:00.000
[tense music]

38:02.250 --> 38:03.500
[general] Ready!

38:06.292 --> 38:07.708
Take aim!

38:11.167 --> 38:12.958
Fire!

38:13.125 --> 38:14.750
[fire roaring]

38:14.917 --> 38:17.000
[men screaming]

38:34.958 --> 38:37.000
[screaming]

38:50.708 --> 38:53.208
[light music]

38:54.083 --> 38:57.708
- [waves crashing]
- [soft music]

38:57.875 --> 39:00.458
[man] Everyone has come
to recognize him as a true heir.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.125
With the prince captured,

39:02.292 --> 39:04.333
I guess his sister Alana is
the rightful heir.

39:04.917 --> 39:06.042
[man 2] It's all a bit muddled.

39:06.750 --> 39:09.250
We farmers tend to stay out
of such affairs.

39:19.875 --> 39:22.667
How do you plan to rescue Lord Mikah,
warrior?

39:23.542 --> 39:26.375
[Talon] Just get me into the castle
and I'll think of something.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.750
[water dripping]

39:34.792 --> 39:36.625
This will lead us into the castle?

39:36.792 --> 39:39.625
According to this map,
it'll lead us right into the dungeon.

39:41.042 --> 39:42.250
Light me a torch.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.167
Give me a hand with this.

39:57.333 --> 40:00.042
[tense music]

40:39.750 --> 40:42.500
Now is that any way to treat
your husband to be?

40:49.500 --> 40:50.750
You're right, Titus.

40:52.333 --> 40:53.417
Take me, my Lord.

40:55.250 --> 40:58.000
[soft music]

40:58.208 --> 40:59.708
Oh, Titus.

41:07.125 --> 41:08.917
Tonight you will be my queen.

41:10.292 --> 41:12.750
And soon, the queen of the entire world.

41:14.208 --> 41:17.083
And I will make love to you
like no other can.

41:19.167 --> 41:20.167
With what?

41:20.333 --> 41:23.208
- [Cromwell grunting]
- [suspenseful music]

41:25.542 --> 41:26.958
[sword scraping]

41:29.208 --> 41:33.500
Love or not, you will be my queen.

41:36.333 --> 41:37.750
[sword scraping]

41:43.292 --> 41:45.417
[Alana]
Nothing can force me to marry you.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.667
Not even the life of your brother?

41:55.625 --> 41:57.125
[man screaming]

42:10.833 --> 42:12.375
[man groaning]

42:16.583 --> 42:18.167
[door slamming]

42:19.000 --> 42:20.458
[laughing]

42:24.458 --> 42:28.500
[man groaning]

42:30.500 --> 42:31.667
Your Majesty?

42:32.792 --> 42:33.833
Your Majesty?

42:36.708 --> 42:38.667
Elizabeth, this is no place for you.

42:40.083 --> 42:41.833
I've brought you some food and wine.

42:42.292 --> 42:43.375
You've labored long.

42:43.542 --> 42:44.833
I thought you'd be hungry.

42:46.417 --> 42:47.542
Hungry indeed.

42:48.875 --> 42:49.917
But not for food.

42:51.583 --> 42:54.583
Dear Elizabeth, your new life
as my consort suits you fine.

42:55.375 --> 42:57.875
I was meant to be yours, my king.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.208
- [flesh sizzling]
- [man screaming]

43:03.375 --> 43:05.208
[laughing]

43:06.083 --> 43:07.292
Leave us, Verdugo.

43:13.708 --> 43:14.875
[yelps]

43:15.750 --> 43:18.250
So, prince,

43:19.167 --> 43:21.333
are you going to tell me where Xusia is?

43:22.167 --> 43:23.417
What are you talking about?

43:23.583 --> 43:24.958
- [groans]
- Mikah.

43:25.583 --> 43:27.958
How else could this rabble
uprising grow this far?

43:28.458 --> 43:29.958
Xusia must be behind it.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.125
He's the only one who can
truly challenge me.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.333
You've been challenged by me.

43:37.333 --> 43:41.125
Xusia of Delos died a thousand years ago!

43:41.292 --> 43:42.292
Ah!

43:43.542 --> 43:45.917
I myself raised Xusia from the dead.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.083
Little did I know what I let
loose upon the world.

43:50.583 --> 43:51.708
Old wives' tale!

43:51.875 --> 43:53.000
[Cromwell] It's no tale.

43:53.917 --> 43:56.083
I've stalked Xusia for ten years,

43:56.708 --> 43:58.875
watching for signs of his devilish work.

43:59.708 --> 44:02.292
He's using you as a pawn to gain
control of my kingdom.

44:02.458 --> 44:04.083
Your kingdom?

44:06.833 --> 44:10.833
Nothing you call yours
is truly yours, Cromwell.

44:13.583 --> 44:16.708
My God, man, there is a demon
in our midst.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.417
And he is the leader of your cause.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.583
Now you tell us where he is
and save us all.

44:23.042 --> 44:24.917
[tense music]

44:25.208 --> 44:28.917
I am the only leader of this rebellion.

44:32.625 --> 44:33.875
Very well.

44:38.458 --> 44:43.000
There must be someone,
a mentor or an advisor perhaps.

44:43.167 --> 44:44.167
[Mikah] There is no one!

44:44.333 --> 44:45.792
He may not look like a demon.

44:46.208 --> 44:48.167
In human form, he can look like anyone.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.750
But there'd be traces of
a serpent in his face,

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
wildness of a jackal in his eyes..

44:56.083 --> 44:57.333
You're mad.

45:00.583 --> 45:01.750
Perhaps.

45:03.875 --> 45:06.375
[water splashing]

45:36.625 --> 45:37.875
[groaning]

45:38.167 --> 45:39.375
What's the matter?

45:39.958 --> 45:41.083
I'm too old for this.

45:41.250 --> 45:42.750
Come on, I'll help you.

45:42.917 --> 45:44.292
I can't take another step.

45:44.458 --> 45:45.667
I'm not leaving you here.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.458
Go on. Save yourself.

45:47.625 --> 45:48.792
I'll carry you, come on.

45:53.833 --> 45:56.125
Over here, come on, rest over here.

45:59.333 --> 46:01.167
Is this the only way to the dungeons?

46:01.417 --> 46:02.583
Yes, my lord.

46:02.792 --> 46:04.083
Don't call me that.

46:06.125 --> 46:07.292
What a place.

46:07.458 --> 46:08.625
How much further is it?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.458
The hidden entrance into the dungeons
is only a little further.

46:16.042 --> 46:18.375
[creature squeaking]

46:24.667 --> 46:25.792
What is it?

46:27.917 --> 46:29.292
What do you hear?

46:30.750 --> 46:32.208
- Is someone--
- Listen.

46:33.417 --> 46:35.833
[creatures squeaking, scratching]

46:49.917 --> 46:52.875
- [man shouting]
- [rats shrieking]

46:53.042 --> 46:55.542
- [Talon] Move!
- [suspenseful music]

46:55.708 --> 46:58.000
- [men shouting]
- [rats shrieking]

46:58.292 --> 47:00.917
[man screaming]

47:02.083 --> 47:04.375
[men shouting]

47:05.125 --> 47:07.042
[rats shrieking]

47:17.375 --> 47:20.292
[stones crumbling]

47:33.083 --> 47:35.542
[man] Uh, you go first, warrior.

47:48.750 --> 47:50.167
Perhaps we should wait for you here.

47:51.375 --> 47:52.458
To guard the escape.

47:54.917 --> 47:55.917
You do that.

48:01.250 --> 48:03.917
[foreboding music]

48:10.292 --> 48:11.375
Quiet!

48:11.750 --> 48:12.958
You want to get us caught?

48:13.458 --> 48:14.958
There are guards everywhere!

48:16.125 --> 48:17.917
- [man speaks indistinctly]
- Where are you going?

48:18.417 --> 48:22.000
[guard] Stop or your leader dies.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.167
[gulps]

48:23.875 --> 48:26.375
[tense music]

48:27.500 --> 48:29.375
[suspenseful music]

48:30.125 --> 48:33.000
[both grunting]

48:43.417 --> 48:45.250
[door crashing]

48:46.333 --> 48:48.125
[tense music]

48:58.667 --> 49:00.375
- [grunts]
- [blow thudding]

49:00.750 --> 49:02.125
[man] Pile of crocks.

49:02.625 --> 49:04.208
- Blast!
- [knocking on door]

49:04.375 --> 49:06.333
[grunts] Get the door, [indistinct].

49:06.792 --> 49:08.583
- [knocking on door]
- [man grumbles indistinctly]

49:11.042 --> 49:12.875
- [man choking]
- [Talon] Pull back the bolt.

49:13.042 --> 49:14.333
[tense music]

49:15.708 --> 49:17.125
[men grunting]

49:20.375 --> 49:23.250
[bright music]

49:34.792 --> 49:35.917
Warrior?

49:36.875 --> 49:38.833
[gasps] It's me, Rodrigo.

49:40.083 --> 49:42.333
What the devil are you doing here?

49:43.125 --> 49:45.542
Cromwell's men were waiting for us
at the sewer opening.

49:46.167 --> 49:48.833
They intend to crucify us
during tomorrow's feast.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.333
I should let them.

49:51.542 --> 49:52.833
Teach you a lesson.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.833
[keys jingling]

49:58.250 --> 50:01.708
- Free everyone.
- [indistinct chattering]

50:04.583 --> 50:06.125
Which one of these cells holds Mikah?

50:06.292 --> 50:09.208
None. They took him to Cromwell's
torture chamber.

50:09.708 --> 50:10.875
Poor Mikah.

50:12.125 --> 50:14.542
[man groaning] Thank you!

50:15.750 --> 50:17.083
Oh, get up.

50:17.250 --> 50:18.958
You're not animals to grovel.

50:22.500 --> 50:23.667
Oh, thank...

50:24.583 --> 50:25.917
Thank you!

50:27.542 --> 50:28.542
Who are you?

50:29.083 --> 50:31.583
My name Esta Devereux.

50:32.417 --> 50:34.708
I was once Cromwell's architect.

50:35.167 --> 50:39.333
After I built this castle,
the king had me imprisoned.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.583
- You built this place?
- Oh yes!

50:42.750 --> 50:45.333
They threw me in here five years ago

50:45.875 --> 50:49.500
to ensure that the castle's secrets
would never be revealed.

50:50.583 --> 50:51.667
What secrets?

50:51.833 --> 50:52.917
Oh.

50:53.458 --> 50:54.750
Hidden passages and...

50:55.833 --> 50:57.458
secret exits and...

50:58.250 --> 50:59.917
and more.

51:00.375 --> 51:01.542
More.

51:03.458 --> 51:04.875
I want you to tell me all you know.

51:05.292 --> 51:08.250
Oh I will, I will.

51:12.708 --> 51:13.708
[door opens]

51:13.875 --> 51:17.250
Sire! The dungeon guards are dead
and the prisoners are gone.

51:18.667 --> 51:20.417
[tense music]

51:21.583 --> 51:22.667
Elizabeth,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
you wait here.

51:24.167 --> 51:25.167
- No.
- Shh.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.083
Trust me.

51:36.208 --> 51:37.833
Kill everyone in that chamber now.

51:48.333 --> 51:49.833
[keys jingling]

51:59.000 --> 52:00.083
Angel.

52:01.167 --> 52:03.250
Hush. Save your strength.

52:03.833 --> 52:05.000
[Mikah groans]

52:08.792 --> 52:10.875
- [Elizabeth gasping]
- [suspenseful music]

52:11.333 --> 52:12.750
- [sword clanging]
- [Elizabeth screaming]

52:20.583 --> 52:22.292
[Talon] Use it or put it away.

52:41.875 --> 52:43.667
[Mikah groaning]

52:47.500 --> 52:49.625
- You did it.
- What did you expect?

52:50.292 --> 52:51.667
I owe you one, my friend.

52:51.833 --> 52:53.208
No, your sister owes me.

52:53.375 --> 52:54.792
Now go before it's too late.

52:55.375 --> 52:57.167
- Come on.
- [groans]

53:02.042 --> 53:03.583
Thank you.

53:04.917 --> 53:05.917
Well get going!

53:06.083 --> 53:07.458
- [Rodrigo] I'll stay.
- [Devereaux] I will too.

53:07.708 --> 53:09.750
We get out together or we die together.

53:11.375 --> 53:12.417
Come on then.

53:12.667 --> 53:14.250
[dramatic music]

53:14.708 --> 53:15.958
[guard] There they are!

53:19.250 --> 53:20.375
[man shouting]

53:20.917 --> 53:22.250
- [blows landing]
- [grunting]

53:24.083 --> 53:25.083
[Talon] Damn!

53:32.458 --> 53:33.583
[grunts]

53:36.417 --> 53:38.750
[men shouting]

53:40.625 --> 53:43.375
[music continues]

53:52.083 --> 53:54.375
[guards shouting]

54:00.333 --> 54:02.125
[mace whooshing]

54:02.542 --> 54:04.125
[man shouting]

54:13.542 --> 54:14.708
[glass shattering]

54:15.000 --> 54:16.125
[gasping]

54:24.042 --> 54:26.375
[soft music]

54:26.542 --> 54:28.167
[guards shouting]

54:28.333 --> 54:29.833
I'd love to stay, but...

54:30.792 --> 54:31.958
[upbeat music]

54:32.125 --> 54:34.083
[guards shouting]

54:34.917 --> 54:35.958
[woman shouting]

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
[women shouting]

54:43.750 --> 54:45.417
[soft music]

54:55.125 --> 54:56.250
[door opens]

54:56.458 --> 54:57.458
[guard shouts]

54:57.917 --> 54:59.667
[upbeat music]

55:01.500 --> 55:02.833
[sword clanging]

55:03.000 --> 55:04.208
[both grunting]

55:05.417 --> 55:06.500
[shouts]

55:07.167 --> 55:09.000
[both grunting]

55:15.542 --> 55:17.292
- [Alana gasping]
- [staff smacking]

55:17.583 --> 55:20.167
[Talon shouting]

55:24.042 --> 55:25.333
[Talon grunting]

55:25.500 --> 55:28.167
- [chickens squawking]
- [horse neighs]

55:28.542 --> 55:30.417
[light music]

55:40.458 --> 55:41.458
[man] General?

55:44.708 --> 55:48.542
- [men shouting]
- [suspenseful music]

55:55.792 --> 55:57.167
[guard shouting]

56:05.583 --> 56:07.833
- [guard] Down there!
- Oh.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.375
[bright music]

56:14.958 --> 56:16.750
[tense music]

56:33.875 --> 56:34.917
[guard] Come on, this way.

56:35.292 --> 56:37.875
[bright music]

56:38.958 --> 56:41.625
[foreboding music]

56:50.208 --> 56:51.292
Who dies first?

56:51.667 --> 56:53.333
[Cromwell] I'll be the first.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.583
[ominous music]

57:04.750 --> 57:07.083
Don't act as if you don't know who I am,

57:08.167 --> 57:09.333
Xusia.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.875
It's your old friend, Cromwell.

57:14.917 --> 57:16.583
[tense music]

57:20.000 --> 57:21.667
[no audio]

57:24.292 --> 57:28.833
Now we'll see how a sorcerer
fares against cold steel.

57:30.750 --> 57:34.500
I'm no sorcerer
but I'll gladly test your steel,

57:35.875 --> 57:37.000
old friend.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.125
[swords clanging]

57:44.042 --> 57:46.083
[dramatic music]

57:48.667 --> 57:50.000
[steel clatters]

57:52.250 --> 57:53.458
[Cromwell] He's mine!

58:04.083 --> 58:07.000
[voices clamoring]

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
[swords clanging]

58:15.167 --> 58:16.167
[guard screams]

58:18.583 --> 58:20.167
[guards shouting]

58:20.333 --> 58:21.750
[Cromwell] Out of my way!

58:33.333 --> 58:34.458
[both screaming]

58:34.625 --> 58:36.292
[water splashing]

58:36.458 --> 58:38.250
[music continues]

59:22.833 --> 59:25.625
[both grunting]

59:27.292 --> 59:28.792
[water splashing]

59:32.375 --> 59:33.708
[blow thuds]

59:40.125 --> 59:41.375
[Cromwell] You! [grunts]

59:42.792 --> 59:45.458
How dare you intervene!

59:45.750 --> 59:47.417
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

59:47.917 --> 59:50.042
But it is a mistake to play
with Xusia this way.

59:50.208 --> 59:52.000
This man's no sorcerer!

59:52.542 --> 59:54.208
Please do not be fooled by this ploy.

59:54.708 --> 59:56.792
Xusia's cunning knows no bounds.

59:56.958 --> 59:58.375
Have you forgotten what this man has done

59:58.542 --> 59:59.625
to your Red Dragons?

1:00:00.167 --> 1:00:01.833
He must be one of Xusia's demons.

1:00:05.875 --> 1:00:06.958
Forgive me.

1:00:07.125 --> 1:00:08.792
I mean no disrespect, Your Majesty.

1:00:09.833 --> 1:00:12.417
I live only to serve the greater
glory of your name!

1:00:13.125 --> 1:00:15.500
Indeed, Machelli, indeed.

1:00:18.375 --> 1:00:19.375
Fine duel.

1:00:21.208 --> 1:00:23.292
Pity we won't learn who's the better.

1:00:23.458 --> 1:00:26.042
[solemn music]

1:00:33.417 --> 1:00:35.083
[tense music]

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.333
[rooster crowing]

1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:42.833
[camels grunting]

1:00:43.292 --> 1:00:44.875
[Mikah yelling]

1:00:47.458 --> 1:00:48.833
[Elizabeth] Easy, my lord.

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.833
Your wounds must be cleansed.

1:00:54.583 --> 1:00:55.708
Rodrigo.

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.667
Yes, my Grace.

1:00:59.625 --> 1:01:01.000
What happened to Alana?

1:01:04.083 --> 1:01:06.250
She is to be married to Cromwell tonight.

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:09.333
[grunts] Like hell.

1:01:09.875 --> 1:01:12.625
And the warrior is to be crucified.

1:01:14.750 --> 1:01:16.042
I should have helped him.

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:17.917
[Mikah groaning]

1:01:23.458 --> 1:01:25.042
Tonight...

1:01:27.083 --> 1:01:28.167
rally our men.

1:01:30.417 --> 1:01:34.333
We will crush Cromwell, or die.

1:01:35.958 --> 1:01:37.458
Go back into the castle?

1:01:38.583 --> 1:01:40.208
How else? [grunts]

1:01:49.292 --> 1:01:50.625
[woman] Come in, old man.

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:54.000
- Mm.
- [light music]

1:01:54.375 --> 1:01:56.333
- [man] Darius?
- [Darius] Mm!

1:01:57.208 --> 1:01:58.375
Darius?

1:01:58.542 --> 1:01:59.833
[light music]

1:02:00.042 --> 1:02:01.292
Well, did you find him?

1:02:01.583 --> 1:02:03.375
Aye. King has him in chains.

1:02:03.542 --> 1:02:04.792
[Darius] Good god.

1:02:05.250 --> 1:02:08.167
What did he do now,
have at one of the king's sluts?

1:02:08.917 --> 1:02:09.917
It's not clear.

1:02:10.708 --> 1:02:11.958
But they mean to execute him tonight.

1:02:12.125 --> 1:02:14.083
[somber music]

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:18.500
Damn. Mmm.

1:02:19.292 --> 1:02:22.042
Go! Roust the men from the house.

1:02:22.208 --> 1:02:23.833
Check the [indistinct] for stragglers.

1:02:25.125 --> 1:02:26.875
- Move!
- I fear we can't get to him, Darius.

1:02:27.042 --> 1:02:28.875
There must be a way into the castle.

1:02:29.042 --> 1:02:30.042
We might all perish.

1:02:30.208 --> 1:02:32.375
Damn you, Philip, then we all die.

1:02:32.875 --> 1:02:34.458
Many a time Talon has saved our skins,

1:02:34.625 --> 1:02:35.917
or have you forgotten?

1:02:36.375 --> 1:02:37.833
I just think we need more men.

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.000
You got 'em!

1:02:40.917 --> 1:02:42.208
Who are you?

1:02:42.375 --> 1:02:45.917
Captain Morgan, an old cohort of Talon's.

1:02:47.083 --> 1:02:48.167
How many are you?

1:02:48.625 --> 1:02:50.958
We number only 20,
surely not enough to aid you.

1:02:51.667 --> 1:02:53.292
Blast you, Eric.

1:02:53.458 --> 1:02:55.542
Spread the word of Talon's plight.

1:02:55.958 --> 1:02:58.583
Half the seadogs in this port
owe their lives to him.

1:02:59.208 --> 1:03:00.417
Now go!

1:03:00.625 --> 1:03:03.167
[bright music]

1:03:06.458 --> 1:03:08.167
See, Philip, you have so little faith.

1:03:08.333 --> 1:03:09.667
Now gather the men!

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:14.708
Myra! Myra, look!

1:03:14.875 --> 1:03:16.375
Look who just returned.

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:19.708
Elizabeth. But is--

1:03:20.542 --> 1:03:21.792
Cromwell set you free?

1:03:21.958 --> 1:03:23.167
No, I was saved!

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:24.458
By who?

1:03:24.625 --> 1:03:26.875
I know not, but he risked all for me.

1:03:27.042 --> 1:03:29.583
This savior, did he have
a gauntlet of steel?

1:03:30.042 --> 1:03:31.125
Well yes.

1:03:31.292 --> 1:03:32.292
Do you know him?

1:03:32.708 --> 1:03:34.500
Aye, all too well.

1:03:34.667 --> 1:03:35.667
Damn his heart.

1:03:35.833 --> 1:03:37.083
He goes for a joint of beef

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:38.958
and ends up rescuing a king's wench.

1:03:39.458 --> 1:03:41.167
And now it falls to us to fetch him.

1:03:41.833 --> 1:03:42.875
He's been captured?

1:03:43.417 --> 1:03:45.833
The lad will be crucified tonight.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.333
[somber music]

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:49.292
We can't let him die for us.

1:03:49.458 --> 1:03:51.125
- We must save him.
- [Darius] We will.

1:03:51.917 --> 1:03:52.917
Let me go with you?

1:03:54.167 --> 1:03:55.208
I know the way into castle.

1:03:55.375 --> 1:03:56.417
Tell me the way.

1:03:57.292 --> 1:03:59.917
I beg you, let me lead you to him.

1:04:00.542 --> 1:04:02.792
[swelling music]

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.167
To the sword, then.

1:04:11.250 --> 1:04:13.292
We should never have followed
that bitch in here.

1:04:13.833 --> 1:04:14.958
Quiet, barnacle!

1:04:16.958 --> 1:04:19.375
It was those landlubbers that
threw us in this trap.

1:04:19.875 --> 1:04:21.167
Watch your mouth, seadog,

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:23.375
before I take this chain and
wrap it around your neck

1:04:23.542 --> 1:04:25.292
till your lousy head falls off.

1:04:27.125 --> 1:04:28.417
If there's battle between us,

1:04:28.583 --> 1:04:30.000
you'll be swimmin' in your own gizzards!

1:04:30.458 --> 1:04:32.875
When we get out of here
I intend to settle this.

1:04:33.042 --> 1:04:35.042
I'll meet you scum, anywhere you choose!

1:04:35.417 --> 1:04:38.125
[men shouting]

1:04:45.667 --> 1:04:48.333
[ominous music]

1:04:50.792 --> 1:04:51.917
Enough!

1:04:52.750 --> 1:04:54.792
Enough, or I'll skin all of you!

1:04:55.625 --> 1:04:57.625
[men quieting]

1:05:04.417 --> 1:05:06.458
What's on your mind, potato head?

1:05:09.125 --> 1:05:11.042
Cromwell sends you a bargain.

1:05:11.875 --> 1:05:13.667
Out of the goodness of his heart.

1:05:13.833 --> 1:05:15.458
[laughs] Cromwell's goodness?

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.708
Silence, you black dog!

1:05:19.708 --> 1:05:22.792
Now tell me who sent you
to invade this castle

1:05:22.958 --> 1:05:24.458
and I'll be merciful.

1:05:24.625 --> 1:05:27.708
[men laughing]

1:05:29.083 --> 1:05:30.250
Bring them in!

1:05:30.417 --> 1:05:32.917
[tense music]

1:05:34.375 --> 1:05:36.292
[Elizabeth groaning]

1:05:43.583 --> 1:05:46.417
[Elizabeth groaning]

1:05:47.250 --> 1:05:49.458
These two had nothing to say,

1:05:49.958 --> 1:05:51.375
so I cut out their tongues.

1:05:52.292 --> 1:05:54.542
Now speak, while you still have yours!

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000
[whimpers]

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:02.750
Tell me who sent you here

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:06.625
or I'll skin her before your very eyes.

1:06:11.208 --> 1:06:12.292
[whimpers]

1:06:17.333 --> 1:06:19.458
- [groaning]
- [screaming]

1:06:26.125 --> 1:06:28.625
- [man shouting]
- [suspenseful music]

1:06:28.833 --> 1:06:31.542
[men shouting]

1:06:39.458 --> 1:06:41.250
- [body thudding]
- [Elizabeth groans]

1:06:42.125 --> 1:06:44.125
[somber music]

1:06:53.542 --> 1:06:55.750
[intense music]

1:06:56.917 --> 1:06:58.583
[men grumbling]

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:02.625
[man] Rat.

1:07:16.375 --> 1:07:18.000
[man] I hear the four kings have arrived

1:07:18.167 --> 1:07:20.000
with one thousand knights.

1:07:20.167 --> 1:07:23.042
But only two will be allowed to accompany
each king to the feast.

1:07:23.208 --> 1:07:25.333
[tense music]

1:07:26.917 --> 1:07:29.500
Once we've assassinated
the kings and lords,

1:07:29.667 --> 1:07:32.000
Cromwell must exchange
his vows with Alana.

1:07:32.167 --> 1:07:34.667
We can send out armies to sweep
across the continent

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:36.458
to consolidate our power.

1:07:37.792 --> 1:07:40.542
With the rebellion crushed,
no one can stop us.

1:07:44.667 --> 1:07:45.667
Where's Cromwell?

1:07:48.833 --> 1:07:50.125
He is preoccupied.

1:07:51.708 --> 1:07:55.375
He has given me charge of his army
until further notice.

1:07:58.833 --> 1:08:00.417
[man] Well, let's finish with this.

1:08:04.125 --> 1:08:05.167
General Thogan.

1:08:06.042 --> 1:08:08.750
My knights will seal off
the exits from the feast.

1:08:09.542 --> 1:08:11.125
No one will get out.

1:08:12.083 --> 1:08:13.083
[Machelli] Good.

1:08:14.583 --> 1:08:15.583
General Rombolt.

1:08:16.417 --> 1:08:17.875
When the signal is given,

1:08:18.042 --> 1:08:21.042
my archers will kill
everyone at the feast.

1:08:22.417 --> 1:08:23.667
General Renqo.

1:08:24.583 --> 1:08:28.375
You shall see to it that all
the kings' bodyguards are dead

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.708
before the assassinations begin.

1:08:33.375 --> 1:08:34.792
What is the signal?

1:08:36.042 --> 1:08:37.667
When Alana gives her vows.

1:08:39.208 --> 1:08:42.375
Imagine, all the nobility of Ehdan

1:08:42.542 --> 1:08:46.500
and the kings of four empires
wiped out in one fell swoop.

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:50.667
Cromwell is a genius.

1:08:52.458 --> 1:08:55.625
[foreboding music]

1:09:01.583 --> 1:09:03.083
In three hours time,

1:09:04.167 --> 1:09:10.083
one man will control
the entire civilized world.

1:09:13.625 --> 1:09:16.208
[soft music]

1:09:18.667 --> 1:09:20.750
[man] Their royal majesties,

1:09:20.917 --> 1:09:22.833
King Leonidas of Benoa,

1:09:23.792 --> 1:09:25.667
King Ludwig of Garis,

1:09:26.792 --> 1:09:28.917
King Sancho of Valencia,

1:09:29.292 --> 1:09:31.625
and King Charles of the Franks.

1:09:31.792 --> 1:09:34.708
- [indistinct chattering]
- [bright music]

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.167
Is that Chief Talon?

1:10:48.958 --> 1:10:51.208
[man] Certainly looks like him.

1:11:00.958 --> 1:11:02.708
- Well?
- It is him.

1:11:03.375 --> 1:11:04.667
How can that be?

1:11:05.083 --> 1:11:07.250
Last I heard he was chieftain
of the Black tribes

1:11:07.417 --> 1:11:09.000
helping them to overthrow some slaver.

1:11:09.167 --> 1:11:11.292
We owe that man too much
to let him die like some dog

1:11:11.458 --> 1:11:12.458
at the hands of Cromwell.

1:11:12.625 --> 1:11:14.708
- Yes, but the treaty.
- Damn the treaty!

1:11:15.292 --> 1:11:17.333
There'd be no kingdoms at all
if it weren't for him.

1:11:18.208 --> 1:11:19.958
- It will be war.
- Very well.

1:11:20.833 --> 1:11:22.417
Let it be war.

1:11:22.583 --> 1:11:24.667
[tense music]

1:11:48.333 --> 1:11:51.333
[foreboding music]

1:11:52.750 --> 1:11:56.667
[men]
Cromwell, Cromwell, Cromwell, Cromwell.

Who are you?

1:14:03.125 --> 1:14:04.125
Never mind.

1:14:04.292 --> 1:14:06.083
The barbarian is to be killed any moment.

1:21:26.292 --> 1:21:27.583
[Machelli] I put your army on alert

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:29.333
and had them gather seven days'
ride from here.

1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:30.583
They await your presence.

1:21:30.750 --> 1:21:31.958
Well that's quite a set up,

1:21:32.125 --> 1:21:33.917
you were assuming something
might go wrong.

1:21:34.083 --> 1:21:36.375
I have lived only to serve you,
Your Majesty.

1:21:37.958 --> 1:21:39.625

We await Cromwell.

1:23:35.833 --> 1:23:36.917
Why?

1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:41.583
To end his reign and begin mine.

1:23:43.458 --> 1:23:44.500
Mikah.

1:23:44.667 --> 1:23:46.917
[Machelli] Mikah is dead.

1:23:56.542 --> 1:23:57.917
I am the power!

1:23:59.042 --> 1:24:01.250
Beyond that gate lies my destiny.

1:24:02.125 --> 1:24:05.333
You can be part of it, or a victim of it.

1:24:05.833 --> 1:24:09.042
The choice is yours.

1:24:12.750 --> 1:24:14.583
[tense music]

1:24:19.542 --> 1:24:20.542
Fine.

You are wiser than I thought, Alana.

Promise me you'll obey my every wish,
my every command.

1:24:47.458 --> 1:24:48.458
