00:01.668 --> 00:04.212
[instrumental music]

00:06.214 --> 00:09.217
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Oh, God.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.845
Did you send our turkey
to Jenny Craig?

00:14.639 --> 00:17.684
No, it's squab.
It's a delicacy.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.145
I wanted to try something
different this Thanksgiving.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.313
Like, make it suck?

00:24.065 --> 00:26.609
[knocking on door]

00:26.693 --> 00:28.194
Coming.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.571
- Hey.
- Hi! Oh.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.780
Make sure you, uh, eat dinner

00:30.864 --> 00:34.117
before you come over
for dinner tonight.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.618
Look, I was on my way
to get the pies

00:35.702 --> 00:37.454
and I saw these at your door.
They're for Val.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.997
They're marked
personal and confidential.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.665
[gasps]
Oh, God! Shh!

00:42.208 --> 00:44.794
Oh, God! I hope those aren't
the annulment papers!

00:44.878 --> 00:46.588
They are.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.298
I'm guessing.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.633
Okay, Tina.
Well, you must go hide those!

00:50.717 --> 00:52.635
You know, isn't it weird
how last Thanksgiving

00:52.719 --> 00:54.596
Val was about to marry Rick,
and that ended

00:54.679 --> 00:55.805
and now this Thanksgiving
she's married

00:55.889 --> 00:57.140
to Vic and that's about to end?

00:57.223 --> 00:59.934
No, no, it is not ending!
They're meant to be!

01:00.018 --> 01:01.895
There's no way
I'm letting her lose this one.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.229
Oh, is that
because you feel guilty

01:03.313 --> 01:05.397
about ruining her wedding
last year?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.567
Shut up!

01:07.650 --> 01:08.651
It was a good thing!

01:08.735 --> 01:11.154
And if I didn't ruin her wedding

01:11.237 --> 01:12.614
she never would have met Vic.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.158
The man she's about
to get an annulment from?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.076
Shut up again!

01:17.160 --> 01:18.203
Now, go
to the Little Pie Company

01:18.286 --> 01:19.245
and pick up Val her pies.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.538
Oh, why do I have to be the one

01:20.622 --> 01:21.748
that waits in that long line?

01:21.831 --> 01:23.416
I mean, I am not the one
who feels guilty

01:23.500 --> 01:24.501
about ruining her wedding

01:24.584 --> 01:25.919
and I am not the one
who feels guilty

01:26.002 --> 01:27.879
about hiding
the annulment papers.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.840
Yeah, but who's the one
who feels guilty

01:30.924 --> 01:33.843
about sleeping with my boyfriend
last Thanksgiving?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.888

This is gonna be
the best Thanksgiving ever.

we got Vic, we got--

02:29.023 --> 02:30.733
- Holly.
- We got Vic.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.695
Hey.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.572
Whoa, hey, didn't the pilgrims

02:35.655 --> 02:38.283
used to hang these
from their rearview mirrors?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.743
[Vic laughs]
Oh, yeah.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.620
Yeah, you see,
it's a, it's a joke

02:42.704 --> 02:45.123
'cause, uh, they didn't have
cars back in the day.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.169
Okay. Well, uh, I'm gonna
get going to the firehouse.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.629
You guys have
a happy Thanksgiving.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.673
What? What do you mean
you're going to the firehouse?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.008
Well, I have a charity event

02:55.091 --> 02:56.759
for St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.720
Every year
they auction off dates

02:58.803 --> 03:00.805
with the bachelor firefighters
for Thanksgiving.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.765
Wait, but you're not a bachelor.
You two are married.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.475
You shouldn't even be allowed
in that thing.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.810
- Well, technically, we're--
- Yeah.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.062
We're kinda neither here
nor there.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.650
But I mean,
if I had a good reason

03:12.734 --> 03:14.861
I guess I could get out of it.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.739
- Vic?
- Yeah?

03:19.991 --> 03:23.119
I hope you go for a lot
at the bachelor auction.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
Thanks.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.084
[clears throat]
Uh, Val?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.628
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.215
Uh, don't forget
to turn off your oven.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.593
Thanksgiving's the number-one
fire day of the year.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.975
What is the matter with you?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.770
- Why did you let him leave?
- I don't know, Holly.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.898
I'm so confused.
I made parakeet!

03:52.815 --> 03:54.484
Well, I am not confused.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.653
You and Vic
need to be together tonight.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.488
Well, it's a little late
for that.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.989
Oh, is it?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.370
Next up, a Thanksgiving date
with Fireman Vic!

04:05.453 --> 04:08.498
[crowd cheering]

04:12.251 --> 04:14.796
- Val?
- We're here for the kids.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.968
- How much money you got?
- Uh, a hundred.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.427
I have hundred.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.888
That makes two hundred.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.475
I'm not just
another pretty face.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.853
We'll start the bidding
for Fireman Vic

04:30.937 --> 04:32.021
at one hundred dollars.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.648
One hundred dollars.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.900
One hundred and one dollar.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.654
One hundred fifty.

04:39.737 --> 04:43.533
One hundred
and fifty one dollar.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.160
Two hundred dollars.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.954
Damn!

04:48.037 --> 04:49.539
What else do you have?

04:49.622 --> 04:54.127
Uh, two hundred
and twenty three dollars

04:54.210 --> 04:57.422
and a lip gloss
in the coral family!

04:57.505 --> 04:59.257
Okay, we have two hundred
and twenty three dollars

04:59.340 --> 05:02.677
for Fireman Vic going once,
going twice..

05:02.760 --> 05:04.804
You are so having
the best Thanksgiving!

05:04.887 --> 05:06.889
(female #2)
'Five thousand dollars.'

05:06.973 --> 05:09.225
- 'Five thousand dollars?'
- Oh?

05:10.310 --> 05:13.104
- Bianca?
- Hey, baby.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.232
- Baby?
- Who's calling your baby baby?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.902
Well, Holly,
it looks like we have

05:19.986 --> 05:21.904
a new Thanksgiving tradition.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.323
Every year
you make my life suck!

05:24.407 --> 05:25.658
Great.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.078
If you and I
pool our money together

05:29.162 --> 05:31.122
we could get the fat chief.

oh, my God, oh, my God.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.301
- What? What?
- What?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.765
- Lauren?
- Gary?

05:48.848 --> 05:51.559
Were you online with
that married poker man again?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.978
He contacted me, I swear.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.522
I told him three weeks ago
it was over!

05:56.606 --> 05:58.441
[laptop beeps]

05:58.524 --> 06:00.860
Oh, my God! Okay.
He wants to meet me.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.695
What should I wear?

06:04.155 --> 06:07.283
Huh, he wants to meet you
on a national holiday

06:07.366 --> 06:08.951
that he should be spending
with his wife?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.787
Mm-hmm, and do you see the part

06:10.870 --> 06:12.789
how he wants us both
to wear yellow carnations?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.124
It's like we're spies
or something.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.753
Girl, have you no morale fiber?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.758
I know that he is married
and I know that it is wrong

06:23.841 --> 06:25.134
which is why I have to meet him

06:25.218 --> 06:26.552
to tell him that he's married

06:26.636 --> 06:28.721
and that it's wrong.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.682
And I will do it
in a very classy way

06:31.766 --> 06:33.851
with my cha-chas like this.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.564
Lauren, I'm serious.
You're gonna get hurt.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.567
Now, promise me
you're not gonna go.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.569
Okay, I promise.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.154
Watching you.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.616
I saw that.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.160
I heard that.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.997
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you're thinking.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.208
Very rude, woman, very rude.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.545
[instrumental music]

07:02.255 --> 07:04.340
But then I thought,
now Val is gonna have

07:04.423 --> 07:06.217
this image of Vic
and his ex-girlfriend

07:06.300 --> 07:07.802
going round and round in her
brain all day.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.929
It's gonna make her
more miserable than last year.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.472
Oh, come on, baby.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.433
Screwing up her wedding to Rick
was way worse.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.894
Aw, you're so sweet.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.063
But not to worry
'cause I fixed everything.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.190
How you ask?
With two phone calls.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.402
One to Bianca who is now
picking up Vic at our place

07:24.485 --> 07:26.863
and one to Vic who's now
being picked up by..

07:26.946 --> 07:28.906
Well...you two
are smart cookies.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.492
You can figure it out.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.743
Yo. Sorry I'm late.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.203
I was having
a confidential meeting

07:34.287 --> 07:35.830
with one of my employees

07:35.913 --> 07:38.207
yeah, and, uh, it seems
that she has been communicating

07:38.291 --> 07:39.417
with a married man online

07:39.500 --> 07:41.377
and is planning
to meet him today.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.296
- Yeah, yeah, today.
- Wait.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.548
Lauren is meeting
her married guy?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.758
I never said it was Lauren.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.640
Excuse me.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.060
Poker man?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.397
Rick?

08:02.607 --> 08:03.858
Lauren?

08:03.941 --> 08:06.736
- You're my poker man?
- And you're my..

08:06.819 --> 08:09.155
(both)
Oh, my God!

08:09.238 --> 08:10.865
What, the woman I've been
chatting with for months

08:10.948 --> 08:13.075
who's so thoughtful and deep

08:13.159 --> 08:16.287
and sexy and romantic is you?

08:17.538 --> 08:20.416
Could you lose
a little bit of the disgust?

08:20.499 --> 08:22.752
No, I, I mean it in a good way.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.963
My, God. Lauren, I knew you
for, what, two years?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.215
All the things
we've been talking about

08:27.298 --> 08:29.133
I never knew
all that stuff about you.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.010
Yeah, well, you know,
you were a little preoccupied

08:31.093 --> 08:33.638
sleeping with
my best friend and all.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.432
Oh, when you told me you were
the fattest girl at fat camp--

08:36.515 --> 08:38.558
Second fattest.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.394
It broke my heart.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.313
God, I don't think
I've ever told that

08:42.395 --> 08:44.273
to anybody but you.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.691
I can't believe it.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.985
'Cause I'm so skinny now?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.780
No, because you're beautiful

08:50.863 --> 08:54.033
and funny and...great.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.372
Oh, finally I can see
the front of the line.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.418
Oh, jeez! At a pie place?

09:09.548 --> 09:12.134
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

09:16.180 --> 09:17.306
Guys?

09:17.390 --> 09:20.059
I-I have to get something
off my chest.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.478
I was talking about Lauren.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.523
[instrumental music]

09:26.899 --> 09:28.234
[instrumental music]

09:29.902 --> 09:32.655
I can't believe I wasted my
pearls of wisdom on that woman.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.324
- My pearls.
- Alright, listen up.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.202
What we all saw
we must forget, okay?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.996
If Val finds out that
Lauren's married guy is Rick

09:40.079 --> 09:42.039
I swear, it could send her
over the edge.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.499
But what if Lauren
says something?

09:43.582 --> 09:45.751
- Oh, if only!
- 'Wait.'

09:45.835 --> 09:47.920
You don't think Lauren's gonna
say anything to Val, do you?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.505
Who in the hell knows
what she's gonna do?

09:49.588 --> 09:51.299
You know, she said
she wasn't gonna meet the dude

09:51.382 --> 09:53.551
and she met the dude.
She's a loose cannon, I tell ya.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.095
- A loose cannon.
- Okay, here's the plan.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.764
I have to make sure that Vic
and Bianca do not leave.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.141
So, Gary, you stay on Lauren
and make sure

10:00.224 --> 10:01.892
she keeps
her mouth shut about Rick.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.145
And, Vince, you stay on Bianca
and keep her busy

10:04.228 --> 10:05.855
and make sure
she stays away from Vic.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.108
And, Tina, just try
not to have sex with anybody.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.572
- Oh, happy Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving!

10:14.655 --> 10:17.992
Ooh, Val, I got you your
favorite sour-cream apple pie.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.703
- Yum!
- Thank you, Holly. Come here.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.040
Listen. I am sorry
about what I said earlier.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.834
It was mean.
You don't make my life suck.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.085
[knocking on door]

10:28.169 --> 10:29.253
Thanks.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.922
- Have you started drinking yet?
- No.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.425
- Hi.
- Start.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.720
Lauren's here! Yay!

10:37.803 --> 10:40.306
Let the games begin.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.184
Sorry I'm late.
I was just picking up some pie.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.733
It's just, uh, I woke up
pretty fragile this morning

10:50.816 --> 10:52.735
you know,
today being the anniversary

10:52.818 --> 10:54.695
of one of the worst days
of my life

10:54.779 --> 10:56.155
and then
we went to that auction.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.531
We never should've gone
to that auction.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.699
'Cause you love Vic?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.326
No, because I am confused

11:00.409 --> 11:03.746
which is why I am so glad
he is going out tonight.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.956
I just need some time
to think, you know?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.375
Some peace.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.793
You don't think it'd be easier

11:08.876 --> 11:12.546
to figure out how you feel
about him if him were here?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.801
- No.
- That's too bad.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.428
[knocking on door]

11:19.512 --> 11:20.805
I'll get it!

11:23.808 --> 11:25.810
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm here to pick up Vic.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.686
Um, you must be Bianca.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.938
[laughs]
Bianca's here!

11:29.021 --> 11:31.816
Oh, God, this is gonna be good.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.943
Bianca? What,
what is Bianca doing here?

11:34.026 --> 11:36.529
Oh, well, she and Vic are going
out to eat around the corner

11:36.612 --> 11:40.533
so I thought it would be better
if Bianca picked Vic up here.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.786
- You?
- You..

11:43.869 --> 11:45.955
Oh, let me fill that up for you.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.126
Ooh, yay! Vic's here.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.461
Um, listen.
We're gonna get going.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.130
We don't wanna interrupt
your Thanksgiving--

11:54.213 --> 11:55.965
Interrupt? Are you kidding?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.259
You're not interrupting at all!

11:58.342 --> 11:59.802
Why are you even
going out to dinner, anyway?

11:59.885 --> 12:02.054
Thanksgiving is about
being with friends

12:02.138 --> 12:04.306
right, Vince?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.894
Bianca, this is Vince.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.980
Hi.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.440
You're pretty.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.569
- Thank you.
- Well..

12:16.652 --> 12:18.112
Take her away.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.158
Uh, ahem..

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
Uh, look, Val, I'm really sorry.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.369
- Are you sure this is okay?
- Oh, yeah.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.663
Well, I mean, well, you're here
and you don't have your coat on.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.332
- Oh, and it is cold outside.
- So it's decided!

12:32.376 --> 12:34.920
So, uh, the auction..

12:35.004 --> 12:37.715
Heard you went
for 5000 big 'uns.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.009
Speaking of big 'uns,
Bianca's a big 'un.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.386
[chuckles]

12:42.470 --> 12:45.890
Uh-huh? So you went
to the Little Pie Company, huh?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.142
Did you find that place
on the Internet?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.853
No, I always get my pies there

12:50.936 --> 12:52.855
you know, weddings,
<i>bar mitzvahs.</i>

12:52.938 --> 12:55.357
All kind of affairs.

12:57.776 --> 13:00.362
[instrumental music]

13:04.783 --> 13:08.078
And then Vic hit the water
and his suit came right off.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.705
I had to sit on his lap
the whole way home

13:09.788 --> 13:12.374
to keep him covered up.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.960
[laughs]

13:15.044 --> 13:18.088
Well, you two sure do have
a lot of naked stories

13:18.172 --> 13:19.590
don't ya?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.634
They're old naked stories.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.011
Well, remember the time
we went go-kart racing?

13:24.094 --> 13:26.514
[clears throat]
They don't wanna
hear that story, B.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.599
The hell we don't! Tell it, B!

13:28.682 --> 13:30.059
[chuckles]

13:30.142 --> 13:32.269
You were supposed to be
distracting her!

13:32.353 --> 13:35.397
Shh. Bianca's talking.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.901
So it was the first time
I had been go-kart racing

13:38.984 --> 13:41.403
and, oh, my God,
the gas pedal gets stuck

13:41.487 --> 13:42.571
the brakes don't work and--

13:42.655 --> 13:43.948
I will never forget your face.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.491
What was the face?

13:47.868 --> 13:50.371
Yeah. You know, she was just
zooming all around the track.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.248
She looked like a five-year-old,
so, uh

13:52.331 --> 13:55.459
I had to jump on behind her
and pull the gas line out.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.462
- Hm, you were my hero.
- Yeah.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.256
Aw! Hm.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.550
It's a good thing
you had those bumpers.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.178
Uh-oh.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.891
Lauren, you're not eating nearly
as much as you did last year.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.978
Now, is that because
you're saving room for pie?

14:14.061 --> 14:15.729
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.773
- It means nothing.
- Well.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.942
I'm just saying,
I'm just saying, you know

14:20.025 --> 14:22.152
if a person gives
another person good advice

14:22.236 --> 14:24.863
she should take it, instead
of going out to buy pie..

14:26.365 --> 14:28.951
...at the Little Pie Company.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.452
Oh, God. Oh, God.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.580
- Something wrong?
- No. No, nothing.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.249
Well, maybe not here,
but this afternoon at the--

14:35.332 --> 14:37.793
Gary!

14:37.876 --> 14:40.212
- What's going on?
- Ask the hussy.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.507
Hussy? No, you have no right
to judge me, okay?

14:43.591 --> 14:45.050
You have no idea what goes on

14:45.134 --> 14:48.470
within these walls
of guilty flesh!

14:48.554 --> 14:49.680
- Say you're sorry.
- No.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.307
I've nothing to be sorry about.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.268
What, how can you look
your best friend in the face

14:54.351 --> 14:56.020
and say that, huh?

14:56.103 --> 14:59.648
This is a good woman..

14:59.732 --> 15:03.569
...with a kind face
and good character.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.488
You betrayed her. You ain't
right, you ain't right.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.826
I'm sorry, Val.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.537
I am so, so sorry.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.499
What? For what?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.878
[sobbing]
My online poker guy is Rick!

15:21.712 --> 15:23.213
What did you say?

15:23.297 --> 15:24.632
I didn't wanna hurt you!

15:24.715 --> 15:27.843
It's just that I love him..

15:27.926 --> 15:31.347
- What? You love who?
- Rick!

15:31.430 --> 15:33.599
- Who?
- Rick.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.020
Rick?

15:38.103 --> 15:41.231
Uh, the Rick I almost married?

15:41.315 --> 15:44.193
But he-he-he
is married to Julie.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.403
I-it's not going so well.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.699
I am so sorry, Val.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.827
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.207
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.251
- Holly, I got it.
- No. I have to--

16:01.335 --> 16:03.045
I'm her husband.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.964
- Her husband?
- Oh.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.175
I am here for you, B.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.970
Goodnight, everybody.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.889
And, you, drop dead.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.934
Bianca, I, I'll get you a cab!

16:17.017 --> 16:18.977
No, I don't think so.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.772
[instrumental music]

16:23.148 --> 16:24.942
[instrumental music]

16:26.527 --> 16:29.071
Okay, honey, I think
you've done enough scrubbing.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.698
Look, come on,
even your gloves are getting

16:30.781 --> 16:32.533
all wrinkled and pruny.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.120
I'm not wearing gloves.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.041
Okay. Um, look.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.627
Baby, I-I get
what's going on, okay?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.921
What happened tonight
must have killed you.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.091
Yeah, I mean,
on Thanksgiving, of all days

16:49.174 --> 16:51.677
you know, the day
that your marriage broke up.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.930
Yeah, and you're
probably feeling

16:55.013 --> 16:58.183
I don't know, just angry
and betrayed and hurt.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.646
Val, come on.
You-you can't hold this inside.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.606
You got to let it out, I mean..

17:04.690 --> 17:06.108
Look, when you heard
about Lauren and Rick

17:06.191 --> 17:07.859
that probably just sent you
all the way back--

17:07.943 --> 17:09.486
Rick?

17:09.569 --> 17:11.113
No, this isn't about Rick.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.866
I can't believe that you
would think this is about Rick.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.285
Uh, for the first time,
in God knows how long

17:16.367 --> 17:18.287
just hearing his name
made me realize

17:18.369 --> 17:19.954
that I have
absolutely no feelings.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.583
Do you like that girl?

17:22.665 --> 17:25.294
Do-do I..
What?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.753
Bianca, hm?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.297
You know, B?

17:33.051 --> 17:34.261
Do you? Do you like her?

17:34.344 --> 17:36.805
'Cause, you know,
she sure seemed to like you.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.475
[chuckles]
Well, what with
all the not being able

17:39.558 --> 17:41.143
to take her eyes off of you

17:41.226 --> 17:43.020
and the nudie stories

17:43.103 --> 17:45.647
and, you know,
the go-kart pedal sticking

17:45.731 --> 17:47.316
and, and the laughing.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.942
I mean,
you guys just laughed all night.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.486
- Yeah, but I didn't--
- A-and I'm not jealous!

17:50.569 --> 17:54.448
No, I'm really not 'cause,
you know, it's just..

17:54.531 --> 17:56.825
Why can't I let myself
be like that?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.869
I mean, have fun
and laugh with you

17:58.952 --> 18:00.162
and be comfortable with you

18:00.245 --> 18:01.663
and have private jokes with you

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
and share little looks
and stories.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.626
I mean, I hate it
that I'm so confused

18:05.709 --> 18:07.920
and so stuck
and so scared and I..

18:21.809 --> 18:23.185
[moans]

18:26.605 --> 18:27.815
Wow!

18:30.984 --> 18:32.194
Yeah.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.030
- Um, Val..
- Mm-hmm?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.323
You-you have just made this

18:36.406 --> 18:38.617
the greatest Thanksgiving
of my life.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.245
You know, the way
the day started out

18:41.328 --> 18:42.204
I never would've thought

18:42.287 --> 18:43.914
that it would be anything..

18:47.584 --> 18:48.836
Oh-oh!

18:50.462 --> 18:53.048
[gasps]
Oh, I'm, like, I never thought
that would happen.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.550
I mean, with the way
that the day started out..

18:54.633 --> 18:56.051
Oh, my God!

18:56.134 --> 18:58.512
I think that I've been forgiven
for last year and this year.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.389
Do you realize that if
I didn't break up that wedding

19:00.472 --> 19:02.599
that never would have happened?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.395
Alright.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.275
- Val?
- Hm?

19:11.358 --> 19:13.151
I swear to God,
I'm gonna make you so happy.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.488
Ha, I am so very convinced
of that.

19:19.074 --> 19:22.035
You know, I am gonna give you
everything you ever dreamed of.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.747
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.917
And that is why I'm gonna
go to the firehouse now.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.796
Well, I did not dream that.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.799
Okay, Val, look,
from the second we got married

19:35.883 --> 19:37.467
you said
this relationship wouldn't work

19:37.551 --> 19:40.345
because we did everything
backwards.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.180
- I said that?
- Yeah, a lot.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.348
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.850
But, look, w-we've come so far

19:44.933 --> 19:48.312
and I-I wanna do this right,
okay?

19:48.395 --> 19:51.607
I wanna give you everything
that you have ever wanted

19:51.690 --> 19:55.777
the courting, the dating,
the wooing.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.655
Well, I'm quite
the little chatterbox, uh..

20:00.407 --> 20:03.702
I never want you to have
any regrets about us, okay?

20:04.494 --> 20:06.288
So goodnight

20:06.371 --> 20:09.124
I'm gonna go sleep
at the firehouse..

20:09.207 --> 20:12.920
...and then you get ready
for the date of a lifetime.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.505
Okay? Baby, look at me.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.050
Be prepared
to be wooed off of your feet.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.594
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.351
Um..
Um..

20:31.521 --> 20:32.773
Alright.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.651
- What a night!
- 'Mm.'

20:35.734 --> 20:37.319
- Yeah.
- Vic?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.695
Yeah?

my best Thanksgiving, too.
