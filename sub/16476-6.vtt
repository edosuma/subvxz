WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:04.945
How you feeling, Erica?

00:04.970 --> 00:06.781
One blackout away from being able

00:06.806 --> 00:08.119
to have little ones, I hope.

00:08.144 --> 00:09.563
Absolutely.

00:09.564 --> 00:11.183
And I told your husband the same thing.

00:11.184 --> 00:13.603
He's in the waiting room
with your mom, dad.

00:13.604 --> 00:16.062
<i>You are going to
knock me out, right?</i>

00:16.064 --> 00:17.893
The doctor didn't say.

00:17.894 --> 00:19.813
Dr. Robeson's not one to chat.

00:19.814 --> 00:23.273
Trust me, you'll miss the whole thing.

00:23.274 --> 00:24.273
Julio, some help?

00:24.274 --> 00:24.879
Okay.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.483
On three.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.644
One, two, three.

00:29.394 --> 00:30.603
There we go. Let's bring in Atticus.

00:30.604 --> 00:32.643
Is that the robot arm?

00:32.644 --> 00:34.183
It's the Atticus
Surgical System.

00:34.184 --> 00:35.273
It's the best tool for the job.

00:35.274 --> 00:36.274
Where's my music?

00:36.275 --> 00:37.273
Coming, Doctor.

00:37.274 --> 00:39.813
Okay, Erica Povery, myomectomy.

00:39.814 --> 00:41.313
Hi, Dr. Robeson.

00:41.314 --> 00:42.563
Hi, Ms. Povery.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.143
Here's your music, Doctor.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.143
Give me 100 mikes of fentanyl,
then the propofol.

00:46.144 --> 00:48.233
All right, you're gonna feel
a chill come over you.

00:48.234 --> 00:49.353
Count down from ten.

00:49.354 --> 00:51.249
Ten, nine... Good.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.143
Ten, nine, eight...

00:53.144 --> 00:55.023
seven...

00:55.024 --> 00:57.603
There's more fibroids in
the uterus than we thought.

00:59.354 --> 01:00.683
Heavy bleeding from that insertion.

01:00.684 --> 01:03.024
- I see it.
- Blood pressure's dropping fast.

01:03.027 --> 01:04.684
- We've gotta stop this bleeding.
- I know.

01:04.687 --> 01:06.313
She's bleeding out. This isn't working.

01:07.432 --> 01:09.353
Dr. Robeson, what do you want me to do?

01:14.414 --> 01:16.118
Dr. Terrence Robeson.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.823
First in his class at Harvard Med.

01:17.824 --> 01:19.743
Now one of the top gynecological surgeons

01:19.744 --> 01:21.033
in the world.

01:21.034 --> 01:24.323
Terry and I went to college together.

01:24.324 --> 01:25.453
- Terry...
- Ooh.

01:25.454 --> 01:27.123
Wait, he looks like that,

01:27.124 --> 01:29.164
<i>- and he's a surgeon?
- Doesn't seem right, does it?</i>

01:29.167 --> 01:30.534
- What'd he do?
- Saved a woman's life,

01:30.537 --> 01:32.493
And now she's suing him for it.

01:32.494 --> 01:35.493
Erica Povery.

01:35.494 --> 01:37.493
She and her husband
wanted to start a family.

01:37.494 --> 01:40.283
But a cluster of fibroids
was preventing pregnancy.

01:40.284 --> 01:42.203
Terry was brought in to remove them.

01:42.204 --> 01:44.953
Unfortunately, there were a larger number

01:44.954 --> 01:46.658
of fibroids than expected.

01:46.683 --> 01:48.746
Now, heavy bleeding is not uncommon,

01:48.771 --> 01:50.743
but in Erica's case,
the bleeding wouldn't stop.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.993
The only way to keep her alive

01:51.994 --> 01:53.323
was to remove her uterus

01:53.324 --> 01:55.573
and perform an emergency hysterectomy.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.323
So now she can't have kids?

01:57.324 --> 01:59.823
And that's why she had the
surgery in the first place?

01:59.824 --> 02:02.453
Erica is claiming that the
hysterectomy was avoidable,

02:02.454 --> 02:04.073
and she's suing for malpractice.

02:04.074 --> 02:05.663
Well, to prove malpractice,
she has to show

02:05.664 --> 02:08.622
that Robeson violated a
reasonable standard of care.

02:08.624 --> 02:11.913
That means a significant
violation of skill,

02:11.914 --> 02:13.823
diligence, or judgment.

02:13.824 --> 02:14.869
Not easy to do.

02:14.870 --> 02:15.913
Maybe not.

02:15.914 --> 02:17.533
But there are people
with skill, diligence,

02:17.534 --> 02:20.123
and judgment lining up
to testify against him.

02:20.124 --> 02:23.073
My guess is the they're
gonna focus on one aspect.

02:23.074 --> 02:25.556
That he rushed the decision
to perform the hysterectomy.

02:25.581 --> 02:26.533
Judgment.

02:26.534 --> 02:28.323
They're gonna say that he could have used

02:28.324 --> 02:30.073
less-drastic measures
to stop the bleeding.

02:30.074 --> 02:32.493
And there's diligence.

02:32.494 --> 02:35.865
Okay, listen, I know that it sounds bad,

02:35.890 --> 02:37.703
but I've known Terry for 16 years.

02:37.704 --> 02:39.951
If there was another way,
he would have found it.

02:39.976 --> 02:41.420
What about the hospital?

02:41.445 --> 02:42.913
They offered a settlement.

02:42.914 --> 02:44.533
But Terry refused.

02:44.534 --> 02:46.057
It would have meant admitting
that he made a mistake,

02:46.081 --> 02:48.664
- and he insisted he didn't make one.
- So if he loses,

02:48.667 --> 02:50.835
He'll be held liable for damages,

02:50.860 --> 02:52.309
which could be millions.

02:52.310 --> 02:54.149
And he may never practice again.

02:54.150 --> 02:58.269
For someone like Terry...
Brilliant, a pioneer...

02:58.270 --> 02:59.689
That's all he has.

02:59.690 --> 03:01.689
I'm assuming that the good doctor has

03:01.690 --> 03:03.099
an equally accomplished lawyer?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.479
Actually, no. He's had some

03:05.480 --> 03:08.189
disagreements with his lawyers.

03:08.190 --> 03:10.229
<i>Lawyers? Plural?</i>

03:10.230 --> 03:12.309
They sent over some pre-trial files

03:12.310 --> 03:14.269
and motions.

03:14.270 --> 03:16.399
I could pull 'em up.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.859
All right.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.649
Let's see what we're up against.

03:20.650 --> 03:23.608
At this time, we,
the plaintiffs would like to call

03:23.633 --> 03:25.820
Dr. Terrence Robeson to the stand.

03:25.845 --> 03:28.359
Benny's a little too excited
to play Erica's attorney.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.939
Residual nostalgia from
his prosecutor days.

03:30.940 --> 03:33.189
But don't worry, it's what we
need to find the weaknesses

03:33.190 --> 03:34.649
in your old boyfriend's case.

03:34.650 --> 03:37.359
Terry. Sharp intake of breath

03:37.360 --> 03:39.599
tells me it was no more than a year.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.189
You're trying to be relaxed, which means

03:41.190 --> 03:42.859
it was a long time ago, but...

03:42.860 --> 03:45.820
that little pulsing vein is the giveaway.

03:45.845 --> 03:47.369
He still has a place in your heart.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.859
It is hard not to feel
continually judged by you.

03:50.860 --> 03:53.599
Well... not judged. Observed.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.269
And you shouldn't be insulted, because

03:55.270 --> 03:56.729
I can't help it.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.559
We were together almost a year,
after college.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.099
Still close friends.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.559
Why didn't you tell me about him?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.229
Well, I...

04:03.230 --> 04:04.649
Terry's...

04:04.650 --> 04:06.769
an acquired taste.

04:06.770 --> 04:09.599
Well, let's see what we can
acquire from Terry's stand-in.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.269
Dr. Robeson, as simply

04:11.270 --> 04:13.649
as you can, please walk
us through the surgery.

04:13.650 --> 04:17.228
Certainly. We began with anesthesia,

04:17.230 --> 04:18.978
a mix of fentanyl and Marcaine.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.100
- Then once the patient had...
- Wrong.

04:21.103 --> 04:23.649
Wh... Are you insane?

04:23.650 --> 04:25.189
It's fentanyl then propofol.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.655
Marcaine would have the
inconvenient effect

04:27.680 --> 04:29.229
of giving her seizures

04:29.230 --> 04:30.438
and putting her in a coma.

04:30.463 --> 04:32.729
Terry, you were supposed to
call me when you got here.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.399
I... I know, I just wanted

04:34.400 --> 04:36.729
to see the magic happen.

04:36.730 --> 04:38.899
We'll be sawing Marissa in half later.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.399
You should stick around.
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.809
You're a psychologist, though, right?

04:43.810 --> 04:45.399
So, not a real doctor.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.599
W... Now, this is
all part of trial science.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.809
This is where we run the
mock trials with experts,

04:49.810 --> 04:51.439
like this MD.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.769
- Yeah.
- And we present various facts

04:53.770 --> 04:57.665
in the case and track
the juror's responses.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.895
And once we hone our
strategy, we bring you in.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.071
Well, based on your so-called expert,

05:03.072 --> 05:04.928
I'd say you need to bring me in now.

05:04.953 --> 05:07.611
We didn't want to waste your time,
given your busy schedule.

05:07.612 --> 05:08.991
But since you're here...

05:08.992 --> 05:11.531
ain't nothing better than the real thing.

05:11.532 --> 05:12.782
Okay.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.019
Get out of there.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.019
Like I said... acquired taste.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.309
Wow.

05:19.310 --> 05:20.649
Dr. Robeson,

05:20.650 --> 05:22.979
you're considered the top surgeon

05:22.980 --> 05:24.479
in your field, is that correct?

05:24.480 --> 05:25.899
And I'd kill to keep it that way.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.059
It's a joke.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.378
Right. Right,

05:29.403 --> 05:31.269
well, let's just talk about
Erica's case, okay?

05:31.270 --> 05:32.519
There's a line of surgeons

05:32.520 --> 05:33.859
who will testify

05:33.860 --> 05:35.729
that you should have waited

05:35.730 --> 05:37.829
to perform a radical hysterectomy.

05:37.854 --> 05:40.059
Yeah, I can get you a line of
idiots to tell you anything.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.939
Especially doctors who
are paid to come to court

05:41.940 --> 05:43.310
- instead of the operating room.
- Are you aware

05:43.313 --> 05:45.059
That you perform fibroid surgery

05:45.060 --> 05:47.099
in half the time as the national average?

05:47.100 --> 05:49.900
- Yes. - So, isn't it possible
that you might have

05:49.903 --> 05:53.019
Rushed through surgery to fit
more in, make more money?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.520
Is it possible you were fired
by the D.A. for incompetence?

06:00.230 --> 06:01.649
I see you did your due diligence.

06:01.650 --> 06:02.730
In the O.R....

06:02.731 --> 06:03.809
Yeah, in the O.R.

06:03.810 --> 06:06.599
I pioneered the use of a
robotic arm called the Atticus,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.519
which allows me to
perform fibroid surgery

06:08.520 --> 06:09.939
in half the time with one thousandth

06:09.940 --> 06:11.439
the number of mistakes.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.269
Their empathy
lines are plummeting.

06:13.270 --> 06:14.979
I'm no surgeon,
but wouldn't you call

06:14.980 --> 06:16.683
- maiming Erica a mistake?
- No,

06:16.708 --> 06:18.977
because she lived. And you're
right, you're no surgeon.

06:19.002 --> 06:21.285
You have no idea what it's
like when every decision,

06:21.310 --> 06:22.689
every incision you make

06:22.690 --> 06:24.301
is the difference between life and death.

06:24.325 --> 06:26.057
It's bloody, it's ugly,

06:26.058 --> 06:28.307
and it's nothing anyone
who went to law school

06:28.308 --> 06:31.347
should be able to second guess.
So let me make this... simple.

06:31.348 --> 06:33.637
The closest thing that
we have to God on Earth

06:33.638 --> 06:35.677
is a surgeon at the top of his game.

06:35.678 --> 06:38.228
So next time...

06:39.678 --> 06:42.228
...you know, maybe laugh at his jokes.

06:43.428 --> 06:46.517
Well, your friend may
have saved Erica's life,

06:46.518 --> 06:49.138
but he just took his own on the stand.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:02.384 --> 07:05.753
We got the results back from our
mock jury. All six found Terry

07:05.754 --> 07:07.423
liable for malpractice.

07:07.424 --> 07:08.503
Anyone surprised?

07:08.504 --> 07:10.803
He's egotistical.

07:10.804 --> 07:11.843
Elitist.

07:11.844 --> 07:13.343
Perfect, or so he thinks.

07:13.344 --> 07:14.758
Holier than thou.

07:14.797 --> 07:18.843
Our client has what we
not real doctors call...

07:18.844 --> 07:21.003
a god complex.

07:21.004 --> 07:22.343
The good news is he's the best

07:22.344 --> 07:23.398
at what he does.

07:23.423 --> 07:25.303
The bad news is...

07:25.304 --> 07:27.304
- he knows it.
- My doctor can think he's a god

07:27.307 --> 07:29.253
as long as he saves my ass in the O.R.

07:29.254 --> 07:30.423
So our strategy is to find

07:30.424 --> 07:32.543
people who are comfortable with jerks,

07:32.544 --> 07:34.673
so long as their jerks are on their side.

07:34.674 --> 07:36.423
Deep pragmatists.

07:36.424 --> 07:37.713
Exactly.

07:37.714 --> 07:39.463
Marissa, would you start building out

07:39.464 --> 07:41.253
a motivational matrix, please?

07:41.254 --> 07:43.673
I want to know which jurors
are willing to bite the bullet

07:43.674 --> 07:45.003
when they stand to benefit.

07:45.004 --> 07:46.753
Danny, let's find better facts.

07:46.754 --> 07:49.883
Starting with the hospital
and this robotic arm.

07:49.884 --> 07:51.093
Cable,

07:51.094 --> 07:53.463
want you to deep dive this surgery,

07:53.464 --> 07:56.423
find out what the hell
went wrong and why.

07:56.424 --> 07:59.253
Chunk, get our doctor
spruced up for court.

07:59.254 --> 08:00.304
Yup.

08:01.258 --> 08:03.003
Benny.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.503
Walk with me.

08:04.504 --> 08:07.923
I know you enjoyed going up
against Robeson in mock trial.

08:07.924 --> 08:10.383
Yeah, you know I love going toe-to-toe.

08:10.384 --> 08:11.673
I know.

08:11.674 --> 08:14.254
And that's why he needs new counsel.

08:14.981 --> 08:16.384
- Seriously?
- We're up against

08:16.387 --> 08:18.633
a sympathetic young woman
who wanted nothing more

08:18.634 --> 08:20.213
than to be a mother.

08:20.214 --> 08:21.793
We need a new attorney who can

08:21.818 --> 08:24.463
balance out Robeson's uber ego

08:24.464 --> 08:27.383
with a more earthly presence.

08:27.384 --> 08:30.673
Well, who do you have in mind?

08:30.674 --> 08:32.303
Welcome back, Liberty.

08:33.384 --> 08:34.383
hi.

08:34.384 --> 08:36.342
I'm excited to be here.

08:36.368 --> 08:38.125
Sorry,

08:38.150 --> 08:39.582
the walk's a killer.

08:39.607 --> 08:41.342
Glad to have you back.
You remember Benny.

08:41.344 --> 08:42.803
You kidding?

08:42.804 --> 08:44.543
Working with you guys on
the Peters case...

08:44.544 --> 08:45.544
That made my career.

08:45.545 --> 08:46.543
Really?

08:46.544 --> 08:48.633
So I can't thank you
enough for this opportunity

08:48.634 --> 08:50.194
to work with one of your clients again.

08:50.219 --> 08:52.423
Wait till you meet the client.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.463
Which one's the magic acquittal tie?

08:54.464 --> 08:56.803
No magic, just medicine for the soul.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.753
In here, I'm the surgeon.

08:58.754 --> 09:00.253
And you are flatlining.

09:00.254 --> 09:02.213
See if we can pump a
little life into it?

09:02.214 --> 09:05.093
Unstructured jacket, earth tones
for balance and strength,

09:05.094 --> 09:07.530
and a pocket square adds sophistication.

09:07.555 --> 09:09.539
Can't imagine anyone's
gonna care what I wear.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.475
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.779
Look, I'm a doctor. You want to
put me in a lab coat?

09:13.780 --> 09:16.119
No, but let's talk psychology.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.159
Something called enclothed cognition.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.989
Subtle changes in clothing
affect the person's

09:19.990 --> 09:21.199
perception of you.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.449
You went to military school.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.159
You read my bio.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.989
I read your posture.

09:26.990 --> 09:29.240
Take that off.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.120
It's too rigid.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.239
In the O.R. what do you do to relax?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.579
Play music.

09:38.580 --> 09:39.909
What kind?

09:39.910 --> 09:41.830
Hip-hop.

09:46.450 --> 09:49.779
Here we go. We need some of that

09:49.780 --> 09:52.239
in the courtroom.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.779
<i>Dr. Robeson's</i>

09:53.780 --> 09:55.579
the man who put Atticus on the map.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.039
He's a pioneer.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.539
Smartest addition I've
made to our surgical staff

09:58.540 --> 09:59.909
in the last ten years.

09:59.910 --> 10:01.659
Is it because of his skill
or because of Atticus?

10:01.660 --> 10:04.579
Both. The procedures he's developed

10:04.580 --> 10:07.279
with Atticus have become
the gold standard worldwide.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.369
These arms are fitted
with surgical blades,

10:09.370 --> 10:11.164
which allow for smaller incisions,

10:11.189 --> 10:13.268
less bleeding, and faster recovery time.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.279
Which means you can
squeeze in more surgeries.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.279
- Excuse me?
- Well, I read that

10:17.280 --> 10:19.869
your hospital does 30 times
the number of surgeries as your

10:19.894 --> 10:20.983
closest competitor.

10:21.008 --> 10:23.159
Everyone wants the best
medical care they can receive.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.449
Why not testify to that in court?

10:24.450 --> 10:26.279
Hospital policy is to

10:26.280 --> 10:28.699
stay out of malpractice suits.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.199
Our employees are welcome to
testify, should they choose.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.199
But don't expect a line out the door.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.699
He's... not our most appealing doctor.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.489
So, you wouldn't mind if I spoke
to other members of your staff.

10:39.490 --> 10:41.240
Suit yourself.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.488
All right.

10:43.513 --> 10:46.239
Liberty.

10:46.240 --> 10:50.410
You ready to spin the wheel
of fortune we call voir dire?

10:50.435 --> 10:52.159
With the questions you
like to ask the jury,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.199
I actually enjoy spinnin' the wheel.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.909
Doc. Doc!

10:58.080 --> 11:00.199
Had you pegged as more Britpop

11:00.200 --> 11:01.140
than hip-hop.

11:01.141 --> 11:02.079
I'm relaxing.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.989
Let's hope dancing isn't part
of his relaxation routine.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.240
There's Erica, the plaintiff.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.579
Wow, she looks...

11:11.580 --> 11:12.475
nice.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.739
Are we going in?
Or is standing outside part

11:15.740 --> 11:17.279
of trial science, too?

11:17.280 --> 11:19.508
Is it too late to switch sides?

11:23.780 --> 11:26.369
Hand in your phone. Judge's orders.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.409
Wait, what? Since when?

11:28.410 --> 11:29.449
Today.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.329
You can have it back when you leave.

11:31.330 --> 11:34.989
Well, Marissa,
this is where we part ways.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.369
Looks like our judge has
an aversion to technology.

11:37.370 --> 11:39.119
Wow. It's been a long time

11:39.120 --> 11:40.596
since you read a jury without backup!

11:40.620 --> 11:41.829
Do you miss me yet?

11:41.854 --> 11:44.279
Kidding? I love flying without a net.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.079
See you on the other side.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.239
What historical figure do
you most admire and why?

11:49.240 --> 11:52.199
Your Honor, is this jury
selection or a talk show?

11:52.200 --> 11:53.600
She has the right to ask.

11:53.624 --> 11:55.199
No matter how stupid

11:55.200 --> 11:57.239
it sounds to us.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.449
I assume there's some strategy

11:58.450 --> 11:59.619
behind this question.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.279
Historical figure?

12:01.280 --> 12:02.579
I'd say Nikola Tesla.

12:02.580 --> 12:05.660
He was a visionary and wanted to
give electricity to the world.

12:07.808 --> 12:10.067
We move to strike, Your Honor.

12:10.068 --> 12:11.843
Now, why would
you strike someone who cares

12:11.867 --> 12:13.199
about intellect and innovation?

12:13.224 --> 12:15.168
Because she's an idealist,

12:15.193 --> 12:16.699
and we want pragmatic
jurors who will put up

12:16.700 --> 12:18.402
with you because you're the best,

12:18.427 --> 12:20.449
despite your prickly exterior.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.949
How 'bout finding people
who care about the facts?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.449
Juror number three.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.039
I'd go with John McEnroe.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.909
<i>That guy was fun to watch
and played to win.</i>

12:27.910 --> 12:29.909
And if anyone got in his way,
he'd shove that racket

12:29.910 --> 12:31.200
<i>- right up their...
- Not</i>

12:31.203 --> 12:32.739
In my courtroom, sir.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.869
Do you see how they're
leaning away from you?

12:34.870 --> 12:37.490
- It's because you're alienating them.
- Yes, well,

12:37.493 --> 12:39.883
According to you, they'll look past that.

12:39.908 --> 12:42.159
Have you ever heard of
the ass-to-awesome ratio?

12:42.160 --> 12:45.199
Because it means the bigger
an ass you are, the better

12:45.200 --> 12:46.489
you'd better be. And you're reaching

12:46.490 --> 12:47.989
that threshold.

12:47.990 --> 12:49.869
- Counselor?
- Have you ever applied that ratio

12:49.870 --> 12:51.540
- to yourself, Dr. Bull?
- Cut it.

12:51.543 --> 12:53.159
We move to strike

12:53.160 --> 12:54.239
this juror, Your Honor.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.410
What?

12:57.160 --> 12:58.949
No. No.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.829
Liberty, no.

13:00.830 --> 13:03.239
Your Honor,

13:03.240 --> 13:04.470
a brief recess, please?

13:04.471 --> 13:05.699
<i>Marissa...</i>

13:05.700 --> 13:08.251
Bull, if you're calling me this soon,
something happened.

13:08.276 --> 13:09.907
Robeson happened.

13:09.908 --> 13:12.277
He's managed to alienate
almost every member

13:12.278 --> 13:13.947
of the jury, and we haven't even started.

13:13.948 --> 13:15.697
Who have we got left?

13:15.698 --> 13:17.317
Well, we have two pragmatists.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.487
The rest are giving him
the cold shoulder.

13:19.488 --> 13:20.698
So what do we do?

13:20.699 --> 13:21.907
Give me a second.

13:21.908 --> 13:23.907
I'm gonna crack the door.

13:26.148 --> 13:28.647
Okay,

13:28.648 --> 13:30.237
juror number two, bespoke suit,

13:30.238 --> 13:31.947
Patek Philippe watch. Flashy.

13:31.948 --> 13:33.407
Everything about him is expensive.

13:33.408 --> 13:36.197
34-year-old investment banker.

13:36.198 --> 13:39.027
His last two vacations were Vegas and...

13:39.028 --> 13:41.487
...Vegas.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.317
High-rollers' table, I bet.

13:43.318 --> 13:45.817
Look at him, sitting in that
box like a king on a throne.

13:45.818 --> 13:47.317
Let's talk about juror number 12.

13:47.318 --> 13:49.407
Looks like she's itching
to jump into the game.

13:49.408 --> 13:51.407
Good guess. She coaches the Lady Jackals,

13:51.408 --> 13:53.557
women's college basketball team.

13:53.582 --> 13:57.237
Ooh. Ejected from three of six
games for fighting with the ref.

13:57.238 --> 14:00.147
Pragmatists will vote for our
doctor despite his attitude.

14:00.148 --> 14:02.322
But these guys will vote

14:02.347 --> 14:05.027
<i>for him because of his attitude.</i>

14:05.028 --> 14:06.447
It's funny,

14:06.448 --> 14:08.817
to save a client with a god complex,

14:08.818 --> 14:11.647
we're gonna fill the rest
of the box with...

14:11.648 --> 14:13.317
A jury of gods.

14:13.318 --> 14:15.607
We've got a high-finance investor,

14:15.608 --> 14:17.697
the high-fashion designer,

14:17.698 --> 14:20.147
high-scoring coach,
high-calorie food critic.

14:20.148 --> 14:23.697
These are all uncompromising,
arrogant alphas.

14:23.698 --> 14:26.277
Let's give 'em Greek names.

14:26.278 --> 14:27.907
Zeus,

14:27.908 --> 14:31.947
Apollo, Athena...

14:31.948 --> 14:33.608
And Dionysus.

14:36.015 --> 14:37.527
For the food critic.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.027
The god of wine and good times.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.447
I like Dionysus.

14:40.448 --> 14:42.224
I forgot you minored in Greek mythology.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.487
That's gonna come in handy.

14:43.488 --> 14:45.737
So our jury's a bunch of jerks.

14:45.738 --> 14:46.609
Not all of 'em.

14:46.634 --> 14:49.317
We have two mere pragmatic mortals.

14:49.318 --> 14:51.317
Erica needs five of six to win.

14:51.318 --> 14:53.107
She has everyone but Zeus.

14:53.108 --> 14:54.487
We just need the other gods

14:54.488 --> 14:56.404
to see themselves in Robeson.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.947
We have our work cut out for us.

14:57.948 --> 15:01.147
I will go assemble a godlike mirror jury.

15:01.148 --> 15:03.777
I finished the deep dive on the surgery.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.278
You're gonna want to see this.

15:07.858 --> 15:09.647
<i>What I found scrubbing</i>

15:09.648 --> 15:12.487
the hospital security
footage is kind of amazing.

15:12.488 --> 15:15.147
Dr. Robeson didn't just
save Erica's life once.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.817
He saved it three times
during this surgery.

15:17.818 --> 15:20.317
The first time, 12 minutes in.

15:20.318 --> 15:22.317
Erica's breathing gets hoarse.

15:22.318 --> 15:24.107
Her face gets red.

15:24.108 --> 15:25.918
<i>She's having a
reaction to the propofol.</i>

15:25.943 --> 15:28.067
<i>But the anesthesiologist didn't catch it.</i>

15:28.068 --> 15:31.067
<i>Robeson did. He gave her a
combo of Benadryl and steroids.</i>

15:31.068 --> 15:33.317
<i>Then, two hours in,</i>

15:33.318 --> 15:35.487
<i>Erica's lost a lot of blood.</i>

15:35.488 --> 15:37.067
<i>But watch the nurse.</i>

15:37.068 --> 15:38.527
<i>She's totally confused, and Robeson</i>

15:38.528 --> 15:40.647
<i>has to come over to help
her pick the right bag.</i>

15:40.648 --> 15:42.647
<i>B-negative.
That could have made her sick,</i>

15:42.648 --> 15:44.527
<i>even killed her. What's the finale?</i>

15:44.528 --> 15:47.527
<i>The bleeding's gotten
so bad they can't continue.</i>

15:47.528 --> 15:50.527
<i>Robeson pulls Atticus out of
the surgery, steps forward,</i>

15:50.528 --> 15:53.607
<i>and performs the hysterectomy by hand.</i>

15:53.608 --> 15:55.527
<i>Wow.</i>

15:55.528 --> 15:56.907
<i>Robeson saved her life</i>

15:56.908 --> 15:59.567
three times. But I don't
understand why these mistakes

15:59.568 --> 16:00.907
aren't in his notes.

16:00.908 --> 16:02.737
Simple.

16:02.738 --> 16:04.607
Robeson covered it up.

16:04.608 --> 16:06.357
But-but why?

16:06.358 --> 16:07.737
I mean, they're not his mistakes.

16:07.738 --> 16:09.907
They are, in a way.

16:09.908 --> 16:14.147
Exactly. I spoke to one of
the many hospital employees

16:14.148 --> 16:16.527
Robeson, rubbed the wrong way.

16:16.528 --> 16:17.947
And it turns out he pulled strings

16:17.948 --> 16:19.737
to get these two on his team that day.

16:19.738 --> 16:21.817
Question is, why?

16:21.818 --> 16:24.148
What else is this god hiding?

16:29.636 --> 16:31.875
<i>So, Doc,</i>

16:31.876 --> 16:33.753
here's the thing. We're
having some trouble

16:33.778 --> 16:36.635
with your eye for talent in the O.R.

16:36.636 --> 16:38.045
Really?

16:38.046 --> 16:39.870
You pulled rank to get
the anesthesiologist,

16:39.895 --> 16:42.835
Dr. Edwyn, into the O.R.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.255
A man whose record is average, at best.

16:45.256 --> 16:47.295
He is, however, an excellent golfer.

16:47.296 --> 16:49.295
And he pulled rank

16:49.296 --> 16:52.046
- to get you into his fancy country club.
- Are you suggesting

16:52.049 --> 16:54.637
I request him so I can
play at a nice golf course?

16:54.662 --> 16:56.201
I'll admit, it felt like a stretch.

16:56.202 --> 16:59.957
Until we learned that, um, Kelly Abbott,

16:59.982 --> 17:01.491
the nurse you most often requested,

17:01.492 --> 17:03.371
has been criticized for slow response time,

17:03.372 --> 17:05.281
and you had an affair
with her 18 months ago.

17:05.281 --> 17:06.472
We didn't have an affair.

17:06.497 --> 17:07.991
Neither of us are married.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.070
Never have been.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.991
And this isn't worth my breath.

17:10.992 --> 17:12.411
Yes, it is.

17:12.412 --> 17:14.491
Terry, this is your life.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.320
Now sit down and let us try

17:16.321 --> 17:19.320
to help you save it.

17:19.321 --> 17:22.241
I chose my team with the same
care that you chose yours.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.281
Preparing for surgery is
like preparing for battle.

17:24.281 --> 17:25.781
There are dozens of risks.

17:25.781 --> 17:27.951
Now, the known risks I can handle.

17:27.952 --> 17:29.991
It's the unknown risks...
Those are the landmines.

17:29.992 --> 17:31.741
Now, if I want to be successful,

17:31.742 --> 17:34.201
I need to turn those
unknowns into knowns.

17:34.202 --> 17:36.151
In the hospital, mistakes are inevitable.

17:36.176 --> 17:38.411
That is why I use Dr.
Edwyn and Nurse Abbott...

17:38.412 --> 17:40.571
Not because they won't make mistakes,

17:40.572 --> 17:42.533
but because I know what
mistakes they will make.

17:42.558 --> 17:44.361
And our records show that
we are an excellent team.

17:44.385 --> 17:47.545
You can't have flawless,
so you go for predictable.

17:47.577 --> 17:49.825
The problem is, her surgery

17:49.850 --> 17:51.981
was neither predictable nor flawless.

17:51.982 --> 17:53.983
And their whole case
hinges on the idea that

17:54.008 --> 17:55.441
you violated the standard of care.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.271
And you're doing their work for them.

17:57.272 --> 17:59.731
They are gonna say that
you were distracted

17:59.732 --> 18:02.760
at very critical moments.

18:02.785 --> 18:06.031
Why would I bring in people
that would cause a disaster?

18:06.032 --> 18:07.191
Golf.

18:07.192 --> 18:08.271
Sex.

18:08.272 --> 18:10.111
I'd stick with golf,

18:10.112 --> 18:12.657
because a subpar performance
is considered good.

18:12.682 --> 18:14.271
Terry, we dig up these facts

18:14.272 --> 18:15.611
because we'd rather prepare for them here

18:15.612 --> 18:17.481
than get ambushed in court.

18:17.482 --> 18:20.151
Do you know why I chose Nurse Abbott?

18:20.152 --> 18:21.531
She's not slow.

18:21.532 --> 18:22.941
She's fast?

18:22.966 --> 18:23.723
She's thorough.

18:23.748 --> 18:25.298
Records processes hundreds of surgeries

18:25.322 --> 18:27.231
from our hospital.
We're the busiest in the area.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.571
Records got the blood type wrong.

18:29.572 --> 18:31.151
Kelly caught it because
she cross-referenced

18:31.152 --> 18:32.531
the charts with the records

18:32.532 --> 18:34.321
and saw two blood types listed.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.821
And as a result, we were only
able to save Erica's life

18:36.822 --> 18:40.151
because she had the two
different blood types on hand.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.821
And as for Dr. Edwyn,

18:41.822 --> 18:45.651
what you can't see is how
cool he is under pressure.

18:45.652 --> 18:47.731
The only other available
anesthesiologist that morning

18:47.732 --> 18:49.901
is a bag of nerves. He drives me crazy.

18:49.902 --> 18:52.821
Now, Edwyn handled a
life-or-death circumstance

18:52.822 --> 18:54.151
without breaking a sweat.

18:54.152 --> 18:56.482
That's also what makes
him a scratch golfer.

19:01.652 --> 19:03.731
So...

19:03.732 --> 19:06.651
we know he can do that.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.401
He's more than just ego.

19:10.402 --> 19:11.981
He has a mind,

19:11.982 --> 19:14.321
and it's brilliant. Who wouldn't
want to be around that?

19:14.322 --> 19:15.441
It's exciting.

19:15.442 --> 19:17.441
Invigorating. And, yes,

19:17.442 --> 19:20.401
it's infuriating, crazy-making.

19:20.402 --> 19:22.611
If only you could change him...

19:22.612 --> 19:24.571
Yes... No. Well...

19:24.572 --> 19:26.271
If he were just...

19:26.272 --> 19:28.402
a little bit more...

19:29.192 --> 19:31.231
Tolerable?

19:31.232 --> 19:35.071
When I finally left him,

19:35.072 --> 19:37.861
I thought he'd actually try to win me back.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.667
Maybe he knew he could never give you...

19:41.692 --> 19:45.481
what you need.

19:45.482 --> 19:48.599
If the gods on our
jury are these arrogant jerks,

19:48.624 --> 19:50.337
they're never gonna listen to anyone.

19:50.362 --> 19:52.771
Not experts and certainly not lawyers.

19:52.772 --> 19:54.441
That's not true.

19:54.442 --> 19:56.531
We have an opportunity here.

19:56.532 --> 19:59.223
We have a panel of jurors
so self-absorbed

19:59.248 --> 20:01.071
that each one of them is gonna think

20:01.072 --> 20:03.441
that we're talking directly to them.

20:03.442 --> 20:05.191
And how do we do that?

20:05.192 --> 20:07.611
Well, we start with the plaintiff's

20:07.612 --> 20:09.731
star witness, Dr. Talbertson,

20:09.732 --> 20:13.321
senior gynecological surgeon
at New York Sacred Heart.

20:13.322 --> 20:15.651
They are relying on him
to prove that Robeson

20:15.652 --> 20:17.231
violated standard of care.

20:17.232 --> 20:18.731
And he's gonna say something like...

20:18.732 --> 20:20.651
When faced with severe bleeding,

20:20.652 --> 20:22.821
the key is to promote clotting.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.271
You give drugs,

20:24.272 --> 20:26.441
give transfusions,

20:26.442 --> 20:28.271
and, above all, give time.

20:28.272 --> 20:30.208
And did Dr. Robeson do all three?

20:30.233 --> 20:32.191
Two. Drugs and transfusions.

20:32.192 --> 20:33.771
But instead of giving it time,

20:33.772 --> 20:36.361
he rushed to the hysterectomy.

20:36.362 --> 20:39.071
No doubt he had a surgery waiting or...

20:39.072 --> 20:40.481
What do you know, you hack?

20:40.482 --> 20:41.441
What do I do?

20:41.442 --> 20:42.651
You let him vent.

20:42.652 --> 20:44.191
The gods will love it.

20:44.192 --> 20:46.373
But cut him off before the
judge finds him in contempt.

20:46.398 --> 20:49.632
No, ask him how long it took
him to get board certified.

20:49.657 --> 20:51.441
How many research grants does he have?

20:51.442 --> 20:52.571
Counselor.

20:52.572 --> 20:54.362
- Terry.
- Is it your belief

20:54.365 --> 20:56.441
That if Dr. Robeson had
exercised diligence,

20:56.442 --> 20:59.651
good judgment, and waited
for clotting to take hold,

20:59.652 --> 21:02.058
Erica would still be
able to have children?

21:02.083 --> 21:03.152
Yes, it is.

21:03.155 --> 21:05.152
<i>- We have no further questions.
- Robeson's outburst</i>

21:05.155 --> 21:06.531
Got their attention.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.861
Now you keep it

21:07.862 --> 21:10.441
by using tailored language,
words that make

21:10.442 --> 21:13.441
<i>each god feel that our
reasoning is their reasoning.</i>

21:13.442 --> 21:15.614
<i>Take Zeus, an investment banker.</i>

21:15.639 --> 21:17.861
<i>He'll respond to statistical analysis.</i>

21:17.862 --> 21:20.401
Dr. Talbertson, how often have any

21:20.402 --> 21:23.971
of your myomectomies resulted
in an emergency hysterectomy?

21:23.996 --> 21:25.911
I've been practicing 20 years...

21:25.936 --> 21:28.071
Three times, according
to hospital records.

21:28.072 --> 21:29.901
And were those three times

21:29.902 --> 21:31.401
an avoidable risk

21:31.402 --> 21:33.934
- or just bad luck?
- I don't take risks

21:33.959 --> 21:35.031
in my O.R.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.981
Really? Let's examine that.

21:36.982 --> 21:39.481
Now that Zeus is listening,
you turn to Athena.

21:39.482 --> 21:41.731
<i>You'll appeal to her
as a basketball coach</i>

21:41.732 --> 21:43.071
<i>hell-bent on winning.</i>

21:43.072 --> 21:46.271
So you claim that
Dr. Robeson rushed

21:46.272 --> 21:49.237
to perform the emergency procedure.

21:49.262 --> 21:50.731
Like an armchair general

21:50.732 --> 21:54.441
second-guessing another's
battle plan, but

21:54.442 --> 21:56.821
when things went wrong
in your O.R., Doctor,

21:56.822 --> 21:59.420
how long did you wait before
beginning the hysterectomy?

21:59.445 --> 22:00.608
I really couldn't say.

22:00.633 --> 22:01.651
Three

22:01.652 --> 22:03.981
unit transfusions... on average.

22:03.982 --> 22:06.571
So do you recall the
number of Dr. Robeson's

22:06.572 --> 22:09.611
unit transfusions?

22:09.612 --> 22:10.611
I do not.

22:10.612 --> 22:11.919
Almost four.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.529
<i>So Dr. Robeson gave more time</i>

22:13.554 --> 22:15.572
for the bleeding to stop than you did.

22:16.822 --> 22:18.231
And Dionysus?

22:18.232 --> 22:19.731
Our food critic.

22:19.732 --> 22:21.611
Did you rush to judgment? Did you feel

22:21.612 --> 22:23.587
the heat of the fire and
panic in the kitchen?

22:23.612 --> 22:25.875
Were you guilty of malpractice?

22:25.900 --> 22:27.314
There are other factors.

22:27.339 --> 22:28.981
There always are.

22:28.982 --> 22:30.981
For instance, when you
say that Dr. Robeson

22:30.982 --> 22:33.150
rushed because he had
another surgery waiting.

22:33.175 --> 22:35.441
Isn't it true that the
waitlist for Dr. Robeson is

22:35.442 --> 22:37.191
months long, while yours is...?

22:37.192 --> 22:38.049
It's less.

22:38.074 --> 22:39.771
And why do you suppose that is?

22:39.796 --> 22:41.901
Could it be because the success rate

22:41.902 --> 22:44.231
for Dr. Robeson is near perfect,

22:44.232 --> 22:46.481
while yours is...

22:46.482 --> 22:50.611
To borrow your own words... less?

22:50.612 --> 22:53.481
More surgeries

22:53.482 --> 22:56.031
and a higher success rate.

22:56.032 --> 22:58.191
It seems to me that

22:58.192 --> 23:02.322
Dr. Robeson is more of
an expert than you are.

23:05.428 --> 23:07.767
<i>Liberty's
cross-examination of</i>

23:07.768 --> 23:10.557
Dr. Talbertson couldn't
have gone any better.

23:10.558 --> 23:12.557
So Erica started out with five.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.677
Now it's an even split...
Three for, three against.

23:14.678 --> 23:16.717
And Erica needs five to win.

23:16.718 --> 23:18.177
It's great odds.

23:18.178 --> 23:20.177
We are not out of the woods yet.

23:20.178 --> 23:21.807
Erica's gonna take the stand next.

23:21.808 --> 23:24.097
You couldn't ask for a
more sympathetic plaintiff.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.427
Ms. Povery,

23:25.428 --> 23:28.057
when did you and your husband
decide to start a family?

23:28.082 --> 23:29.829
During his last tour in Afghanistan.

23:29.854 --> 23:32.267
When he got back for good,
we started trying.

23:32.268 --> 23:34.387
Did you ask your doctor why
you were unable to conceive?

23:34.388 --> 23:36.677
She said I had uterine fibroids.

23:36.678 --> 23:38.007
And did she recommend a surgeon?

23:38.008 --> 23:39.677
Yes.

23:39.678 --> 23:41.253
Dr. Robeson.

23:41.278 --> 23:43.427
She said he was the best.

23:43.428 --> 23:47.137
And after the surgery, how did
Dr. Robeson behave toward you?

23:47.138 --> 23:49.217
He barely acknowledged me.

23:49.218 --> 23:51.597
Mumbled something.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.347
A nurse had to come in later
and explain what happened.

23:55.348 --> 23:57.307
I tried calling him.

23:57.308 --> 23:59.767
He didn't return my call.

23:59.768 --> 24:01.677
How is that

24:01.678 --> 24:03.508
being the best?

24:04.558 --> 24:06.558
Your witness.

24:08.178 --> 24:10.307
Erica,

24:10.308 --> 24:12.347
I appreciate how hard this is for you.

24:12.348 --> 24:14.307
Especially considering...

24:14.308 --> 24:17.427
well, would you agree that the
defendant, Dr. Robeson,

24:17.428 --> 24:18.557
is kind of a jerk?

24:18.558 --> 24:19.558
Objection!

24:21.542 --> 24:23.427
She's trashing her own client.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.057
Are you sure you want to object?

24:25.058 --> 24:27.217
Objection withdrawn.

24:27.218 --> 24:28.557
Are you aware that

24:28.558 --> 24:31.137
Winston Churchill was called a jerk?

24:31.138 --> 24:33.347
Steve Jobs, a jerk.

24:33.348 --> 24:35.177
I guess.

24:35.202 --> 24:37.661
World-class achievers

24:37.662 --> 24:40.557
and world-class egos go hand in hand.

24:40.558 --> 24:44.427
So thank God you can't sue
someone for being a jerk.

24:44.428 --> 24:46.347
I'm not suing him for being a jerk.

24:46.348 --> 24:49.427
I'm suing him because he made a mistake.

24:49.428 --> 24:50.807
And his ego is

24:50.808 --> 24:52.887
so big he can't even admit it.

24:52.888 --> 24:56.307
My husband and I have been
trying to have children

24:56.308 --> 24:58.467
for years. This surgery

24:58.468 --> 25:00.467
was supposed to allow us
to fulfill that dream.

25:00.468 --> 25:02.198
He knew that.

25:02.223 --> 25:03.677
Instead,

25:03.678 --> 25:05.268
he butchered me.

25:09.428 --> 25:11.928
I wanted to be a mom.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.637
This jerk missed the
point of her surgery.

25:17.638 --> 25:19.348
- He should have tried harder.
- He wouldn't risk

25:19.351 --> 25:21.307
His ego by talking to his own patient.

25:21.308 --> 25:23.307
Weak.

25:23.308 --> 25:25.347
I wonder how much for that watch.

25:25.348 --> 25:27.807
Something's up with Dionysus.

25:27.808 --> 25:30.507
Erica turned
two jurors against us.

25:30.508 --> 25:32.177
I mean, they feel she's been wronged,

25:32.178 --> 25:33.927
even if she didn't technically prove

25:33.928 --> 25:36.217
Terry violated her standard of care.

25:36.218 --> 25:38.767
That's not the only challenge
we've come across today.

25:38.768 --> 25:42.307
Dionysus was paying more
attention to Zeus' watch

25:42.308 --> 25:45.267
than paying attention
to Erica's testimony.

25:45.268 --> 25:47.718
And that is wrong on many levels.

25:51.799 --> 25:54.113
Dionysus has a spring in his step.

25:54.147 --> 25:56.507
Yup, the spring of a man about
to step into a new Mercedes.

25:56.508 --> 25:58.264
I tailed him all the
way from the dealership.

25:58.288 --> 25:59.491
According to his e-mails,

25:59.516 --> 26:02.057
he also just put in for a
two-week vacation.

26:02.058 --> 26:04.467
Where is he off to? Mount Olympus?

26:04.468 --> 26:07.267
St. Barts. His room's going
for two grand a night.

26:07.268 --> 26:09.557
St. Barts. I like St. Barts.

26:09.558 --> 26:12.097
So the son of a bitch has
been bought off.

26:12.098 --> 26:14.807
Yeah, someone else is
definitely working this trial.

26:14.808 --> 26:18.428
Well, nobody messes
with my jury but me.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.319
I found this guy Victor.
He's a contract fixer.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.086
Danny got some photos of him.

26:28.111 --> 26:30.063
And who is he speaking with?

26:30.088 --> 26:31.815
Alexander Greyridge, PhD,

26:31.840 --> 26:35.609
VP of the company that makes
the Atticus robotic arm.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.920
So Atticus bought the fixer,
the fixer bought the juror.

26:37.945 --> 26:38.690
Right.

26:38.693 --> 26:41.609
Dionysus is on our side,
but not under our control.

26:41.610 --> 26:44.480
I still haven't found a
digital footprint yet.

26:44.481 --> 26:46.399
And I don't really understand
why they're so desperate

26:46.400 --> 26:47.739
to get Robeson off.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.439
I need access to the Atticus, but

26:50.440 --> 26:52.609
it's secured inside the hospital.

26:52.610 --> 26:53.939
Remember that outfit

26:53.940 --> 26:56.149
Danny wore to the Halloween
party last year?

26:56.150 --> 26:57.860
What, the nurse's outfit?

26:59.321 --> 27:01.767
I see what you mean.

27:01.768 --> 27:03.347
I'll let you two take it

27:03.348 --> 27:04.847
from there. Have fun.

27:13.848 --> 27:16.267
Whoa.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.477
43-year-old single malt.

27:18.478 --> 27:20.607
You have impeccable taste, sir.

27:20.632 --> 27:23.524
Thanks. I recognize you from court.

27:23.549 --> 27:25.107
You're defending Robeson, right?

27:25.108 --> 27:27.307
I think we both are.

27:27.308 --> 27:30.687
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:30.688 --> 27:34.057
Relax. I'm not here to expose you.

27:34.058 --> 27:35.397
I'm here to help you.

27:35.398 --> 27:38.477
Nicky...

27:38.478 --> 27:41.397
you've been making some noise.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.398
I've been very discreet.

27:45.108 --> 27:47.147
Nicholas, a $200 bottle of Scotch,

27:47.148 --> 27:51.147
<i>a plane ticket to St. Barts,
and a new Mercedes is not discreet.</i>

27:51.148 --> 27:54.017
You know what'll happen if you get caught?

27:54.018 --> 27:55.397
Five years.

27:55.398 --> 27:57.874
And you would have to find your
own defense attorney, because

27:57.899 --> 28:00.477
our mutual benefactor wouldn't
be able to help you out.

28:00.478 --> 28:02.347
Victor said he'd help me out.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.347
Victor.

28:04.348 --> 28:07.437
Maybe you don't know Victor

28:07.438 --> 28:09.847
as well as you think you do.

28:09.848 --> 28:11.847
If you keep misbehaving,

28:11.848 --> 28:15.148
I'll go to the judge myself.

28:18.518 --> 28:20.397
I want out. Please?

28:20.398 --> 28:22.107
There's got to be a way.

28:22.108 --> 28:24.107
I'll tell Victor.

28:24.108 --> 28:27.228
Just don't show up in court.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.588
This is ridiculous!
Where is juror number four?

28:39.438 --> 28:41.102
That's it!

28:41.127 --> 28:43.767
Officer, we need a replacement
for juror number four.

28:43.768 --> 28:45.250
Please call the first alternate.

28:45.275 --> 28:48.977
Alternate juror number one?

28:48.978 --> 28:51.847
That would be Gladys,

28:51.848 --> 28:53.767
licensed sex therapist.

28:53.768 --> 28:55.897
Looks like we're in for
some mutually-gratifying

28:55.898 --> 28:57.477
deliberations.

28:57.478 --> 28:59.607
I think we call her Aphrodite.

28:59.608 --> 29:01.517
Nice work
getting rid of Dionysus.

29:01.518 --> 29:05.557
Tell me Aphrodite's had a
consensual effect on our jury.

29:05.558 --> 29:06.897
Our jury loves her.

29:06.898 --> 29:08.397
See for yourself.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.187
Well, leave it to a sex therapist

29:10.188 --> 29:12.647
to have all the skills it
takes to unite Mount Olympus.

29:12.648 --> 29:13.977
But she has already

29:13.978 --> 29:15.977
formed an opinion of our good doctor,

29:15.978 --> 29:17.517
and it's not so therapeutic.

29:17.518 --> 29:21.057
So, what does it take for
someone with a big heart

29:21.058 --> 29:22.734
to warm to someone with a prickly ego?

29:22.754 --> 29:24.213
We are talking about me

29:24.214 --> 29:25.503
and Terry now, aren't we?

29:25.504 --> 29:27.044
Are we?

29:37.884 --> 29:40.265
Cable? Cable, let's go.

29:40.290 --> 29:42.963
Okay.

29:47.214 --> 29:50.583
Hurry, Cable. We've got a tight
window to hack into Atticus.

29:50.584 --> 29:52.253
We need a go word.

29:52.254 --> 29:53.478
What?

29:53.503 --> 29:55.254
You know, a word that
tells the other person that

29:55.257 --> 29:58.463
The coast is clear.
Something like... ampicillin?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.793
Ampicillin?

29:59.794 --> 30:01.293
I don't know. What did
you use in the bureau?

30:01.294 --> 30:04.293
We used to say, "Clear."

30:04.294 --> 30:05.714
Okay, clear.

30:15.714 --> 30:16.843
This is incredible.

30:16.844 --> 30:18.793
It's a near-flawless system.

30:18.794 --> 30:21.633
10,000 self-checks a second,
no history of malfunction.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.174
Wait. When was Erica's surgery?

30:23.175 --> 30:24.713
The 16th.

30:24.714 --> 30:26.843
There was an update just
two days before that,

30:26.844 --> 30:29.253
but they installed a patch the
day after Erica's operation.

30:29.254 --> 30:30.923
Why the hell would they do that?

30:30.924 --> 30:32.843
Cable, we have a house
call. Come on. Come on.

30:32.844 --> 30:34.253
I'm on it.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.713
You're fast, Doc,

30:40.714 --> 30:42.294
but I'm faster.

30:49.924 --> 30:51.293
Is anybody in here?

30:51.294 --> 30:53.463
Security?

30:53.464 --> 30:55.463
Hi. This is Dr. Lewis.

30:55.464 --> 30:56.884
- I'm trying to get into O.R. room three...
- Hey. Doc.

30:56.887 --> 30:58.423
...and the keypad won't work.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.424
Go.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.423
Dr. Lewis.

31:00.424 --> 31:02.003
Dr. Lewis to the ER.

31:02.004 --> 31:04.424
Dr. Lewis, you're needed in the ER.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.674
Clear?

31:06.675 --> 31:07.883
Ampicillin.

31:07.884 --> 31:10.173
<i>Atticus's quarterly</i>

31:10.174 --> 31:11.463
software update caused

31:11.464 --> 31:13.383
an error in one of the
arm's calibrations.

31:13.384 --> 31:14.843
It wasn't much.

31:14.844 --> 31:17.253
Less than 100 nanometers off
of what Robeson commanded.

31:17.254 --> 31:19.293
But impossible for the
human eye to detect.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.503
It was already

31:20.504 --> 31:23.173
a bloody surgery,
making it difficult to see clearly.

31:23.174 --> 31:24.948
But when Robeson commanded Atticus

31:24.973 --> 31:27.080
to cut into one of the
hard-to-reach fibroids,

31:27.105 --> 31:30.253
it nicked one of Erica's blood vessels.

31:30.254 --> 31:32.293
Terry didn't make a mistake. Atticus did.

31:32.294 --> 31:33.673
And they knew it,

31:33.674 --> 31:36.423
so they patched the
software and bribed Dionysus

31:36.424 --> 31:40.673
so they could buy the
"not liable" verdict.

31:40.674 --> 31:42.633
Didn't want to damage
the doctor's good name.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.543
It's their best marketing tool.

31:44.544 --> 31:47.173
This evidence was obtained illegally.

31:47.174 --> 31:49.765
We're gonna have to subpoena
Atticus for their records.

31:49.790 --> 31:51.503
If they're dirty enough to bribe a juror,

31:51.504 --> 31:53.898
they'll definitely cover up the patch.

31:53.923 --> 31:56.383
Yeah. They'll try.

31:56.384 --> 31:59.383
But if Liberty calls
Dr. Greyridge to the stand

31:59.384 --> 32:01.383
and he's the lead engineer for Atticus,

32:01.384 --> 32:05.083
then he'll assume he's
there to defend Robeson.

32:05.084 --> 32:08.214
Then we make him meet his own creation.

32:10.634 --> 32:13.713
The Atticus Surgical System
took 12 years and more than

32:13.714 --> 32:15.293
$100 million to develop.

32:15.294 --> 32:16.633
And since then,

32:16.634 --> 32:18.543
how many surgical errors
have been reported?

32:18.544 --> 32:19.793
Zero.

32:19.794 --> 32:21.423
None whatsoever.

32:21.424 --> 32:23.084
That is impressive.

32:24.504 --> 32:27.144
Would you be willing to
put that to the test?

32:27.169 --> 32:28.503
There's a demo
mode, if you'd like...

32:28.504 --> 32:30.633
What about
something more hands-on?

32:30.634 --> 32:34.673
Specifically, your hand on this table.

32:34.674 --> 32:37.043
We would like to play a version

32:37.044 --> 32:39.384
of the knife game.

32:40.424 --> 32:44.503
Only in place of the knife...

32:45.844 --> 32:47.133
Objection.

32:47.134 --> 32:48.883
Your Honor, we respect
the court's decision

32:48.884 --> 32:50.015
to use the machine,

32:50.040 --> 32:52.753
but this is turning into a sideshow,
a dangerous one.

32:52.754 --> 32:54.463
I'm inclined to agree.

32:54.464 --> 32:56.043
Counselor, where are we going with this?

32:56.044 --> 32:57.753
Nobody is going to get hurt.

32:57.754 --> 33:00.383
We have calibrated the
machine to this grid.

33:00.384 --> 33:03.174
The jury deserves to see it in action.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.830
Dr. Greyridge?

33:09.844 --> 33:12.173
Of course.

33:12.174 --> 33:13.673
I trust Atticus.

33:13.674 --> 33:16.963
One more thing.

33:16.964 --> 33:18.963
In order for this to be accurate,

33:18.964 --> 33:20.753
we need to use the same
version of the software

33:20.754 --> 33:23.173
that was used for Erica's surgery.

33:23.174 --> 33:25.231
So we've had the technician roll it back.

33:25.256 --> 33:27.926
Everybody ready?

33:46.486 --> 33:48.838
When I give the word,
we will demonstrate for the jury

33:48.862 --> 33:50.282
the 100% accuracy

33:50.307 --> 33:52.836
of the Atticus Surgical System,

33:52.861 --> 33:56.008
calibrated with the same
version of the software

33:56.033 --> 33:58.193
used on the day of Erica's surgery.

34:03.918 --> 34:05.048
And...

34:05.933 --> 34:07.012
Wait!

34:07.037 --> 34:08.355
Dr. Greyridge, what's wrong?

34:08.356 --> 34:10.655
I-I don't understand.

34:10.656 --> 34:15.355
Are you saying that even in the
hands of a skilled technician,

34:15.356 --> 34:17.413
atticus could miss?

34:17.438 --> 34:19.395
He could cut the wrong thing?

34:19.396 --> 34:22.105
I... I don't know.

34:22.106 --> 34:23.945
How do you not know?

34:23.946 --> 34:26.855
Was there a change in
the software recently?

34:26.856 --> 34:29.371
A patch just 18 hours

34:29.396 --> 34:31.056
after Erica's surgery?

34:34.396 --> 34:37.606
I... don't have to answer that.

34:44.156 --> 34:46.978
All right, one against
and four on the fence.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.681
Zeus works with high-tech
investing algorithms,

34:49.681 --> 34:51.221
so exposing the flaws

34:51.222 --> 34:53.431
in Atticus's software was
enough to convince him.

34:53.456 --> 34:55.554
But I'm at a loss how
to win over the others.

34:55.579 --> 34:57.143
I mean, the machine malfunctioned.

34:57.143 --> 34:59.183
How could they not be swayed by that?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.603
Because this was never about the machine.

35:01.604 --> 35:04.224
Or the surgery.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.313
It's about what happened after.

35:07.314 --> 35:10.313
Robeson never violated any
physical standard of care.

35:10.314 --> 35:14.393
But when he wasn't
really there for Erica,

35:14.394 --> 35:16.313
he violated an emotional one.

35:16.314 --> 35:20.117
They need to emotionally connect
with him, or he's done.

35:20.142 --> 35:23.183
And Aphrodite is the
most influential juror.

35:23.184 --> 35:24.393
So we're gonna turn her.

35:24.394 --> 35:27.063
Here's everything we have on her.

35:27.064 --> 35:30.473
Happily married,
multiple awards in her field...

35:30.474 --> 35:32.134
Weekly advice column:

35:32.159 --> 35:33.584
"Gladys Gets Intimate."

35:34.814 --> 35:35.986
Here's her latest post.

35:36.011 --> 35:38.853
"Who is the Sexiest Man Alive?

35:38.854 --> 35:41.523
The One Who Knows He
Can't Fix Everything."

35:41.524 --> 35:43.103
Do men really try to fix every...

35:43.104 --> 35:44.207
Yes. You do.

35:44.232 --> 35:46.074
Aphrodite needs to hear a man say

35:46.099 --> 35:49.183
he can't fix everything,
so we're putting Robeson

35:49.184 --> 35:50.393
on the stand.

35:50.394 --> 35:52.643
Wh...? You kidding me?

35:52.644 --> 35:54.353
He'll never admit to
something he can't do.

35:54.354 --> 35:56.353
It's true. You said it yourself, Bull.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.523
When it comes to surgery,
Terry thinks he's infallible.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.523
Nobody could make him say otherwise.

36:00.524 --> 36:03.433
I know someone who could.

36:03.434 --> 36:05.183
Me?

36:07.184 --> 36:09.393
You went toe-to-toe with
him and you struck a nerve.

36:09.394 --> 36:10.563
And now, Benny,

36:10.564 --> 36:12.813
now I want you to go for his jugular.

36:15.863 --> 36:17.723
Sorry. Terry.

36:17.724 --> 36:19.933
What? So I'm testifying after all?

36:19.934 --> 36:21.763
Do you remember when you invited me

36:21.764 --> 36:22.935
to an operating theatre

36:22.960 --> 36:25.723
to watch a man get a high-tech
pacemaker surgically installed?

36:25.724 --> 36:26.803
Yeah. You threw up.

36:26.828 --> 36:29.313
Twice. It wasn't until you
kissed me on the walk home

36:29.314 --> 36:31.103
that I realized that was our first date.

36:31.104 --> 36:32.523
I'm just glad I brought breath mints.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.523
What does this have to do
with me taking the stand?

36:34.524 --> 36:36.143
Listen.

36:36.144 --> 36:38.839
That was the worst idea
for a first date ever.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.683
You knew you screwed the whole thing up.

36:40.684 --> 36:42.063
The man who, on our second date,

36:42.064 --> 36:44.933
asked me to come with him
to change his car tires,

36:44.934 --> 36:46.253
and wore corduroy shorts

36:46.278 --> 36:48.183
and a stained NASA jersey that said,

36:48.184 --> 36:49.925
"Failure Is Not An Option."

36:49.950 --> 36:53.263
Well, that was
the day I fell for you.

36:53.264 --> 36:55.433
You were just so easy to spend time with.

36:55.434 --> 36:57.263
You made me laugh.

36:57.264 --> 36:58.853
Likewise, believe me.

36:58.854 --> 37:02.973
That jury has only seen
Dr. Robeson, the surgeon.

37:02.974 --> 37:05.643
They need to see Terry the endearing.

37:05.668 --> 37:08.115
That's the man I fell for.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.354
That's the man they need to see.

37:12.732 --> 37:16.523
Would you say you followed
all reasonable protocols

37:16.524 --> 37:17.723
and standards?

37:17.724 --> 37:19.071
No. I exceeded them.

37:19.096 --> 37:22.393
But expert witnesses said
that your actions fell below

37:22.394 --> 37:24.473
a reasonable standard of care.

37:24.474 --> 37:25.973
They were wrong.

37:25.974 --> 37:28.163
I... I believe you.

37:28.188 --> 37:30.767
But I don't think that they do.

37:32.034 --> 37:33.324
Why do you think that is?

37:35.142 --> 37:37.088
You'd have to ask them.

37:37.113 --> 37:38.523
I can't.

37:38.524 --> 37:39.933
I'm asking you.

37:39.934 --> 37:41.723
You cut up an innocent woman.

37:41.724 --> 37:43.047
I didn't cut her up.

37:43.072 --> 37:44.492
I performed an operation...

37:44.517 --> 37:46.646
An operation she didn't ask for.

37:46.671 --> 37:48.686
Now she can't have kids.

37:48.711 --> 37:51.327
She couldn't have children before the
surgery because of the fibroids.

37:51.328 --> 37:53.701
So that gives you permission
to mangle a young woman's body?

37:53.726 --> 37:55.207
I didn't man...

37:55.208 --> 37:57.997
I saved her life.

37:57.998 --> 37:59.662
Then why don't they believe you?

37:59.687 --> 38:00.827
Well, I can't force them

38:00.828 --> 38:02.788
- to believe me.
- So, so let me get this straight.

38:02.791 --> 38:04.827
You're asking them to somehow

38:04.828 --> 38:07.526
get inside your head
during the operation?

38:07.551 --> 38:08.997
I don't want them inside my head.

38:08.998 --> 38:12.077
Wh-wh-why? Because you're
such a private man?

38:12.078 --> 38:14.627
Because you're so brilliant
they won't understand?

38:14.628 --> 38:16.207
No, because it's overwhelming!

38:16.879 --> 38:20.378
Do you want to know what's going on
inside my head in the O.R. that day?

38:20.403 --> 38:22.903
Blood pressure 100/65,
normal but dropping.

38:22.928 --> 38:24.603
Watch for 70 over 45.

38:24.628 --> 38:26.867
Heart rhythm irregular...
Common under anesthesia.

38:26.868 --> 38:30.287
Incising first fibroid,
tissue firmer than expected.

38:30.288 --> 38:32.127
Adjust angle, oxygen, a bit too high,

38:32.128 --> 38:34.287
may need pulse oximeter to verify.

38:34.288 --> 38:36.127
And that's just the first ten seconds.

38:36.128 --> 38:37.770
That all sounds very technical.

38:37.795 --> 38:39.327
Well, there are a dozen more
decisions to be made

38:39.328 --> 38:40.577
every second after that.

38:40.578 --> 38:43.497
Decisions that call on
every ounce of my education,

38:43.498 --> 38:46.327
my expertise, my judgment.

38:46.328 --> 38:49.457
Decisions that threaten life,
alter life, save life.

38:49.458 --> 38:52.707
Decisions that none of
you are qualified to make,

38:52.708 --> 38:55.077
none of you want to make.

39:03.128 --> 39:04.918
You make a lot of friends at Harvard?

39:08.320 --> 39:10.021
I went to Harvard because I wanted

39:10.054 --> 39:12.497
to be a great surgeon, and I am.

39:12.498 --> 39:14.667
I just can't do anything else.

39:14.668 --> 39:18.627
This... flood of information
makes me excellent at what I do.

39:18.628 --> 39:20.787
I see flaws, I diagnose them.

39:20.788 --> 39:22.247
I attack them and I fix them.

39:22.248 --> 39:24.327
In the O.R., I know exactly what to do,

39:24.328 --> 39:26.707
whom to have on my team,
when and where to cut and sew.

39:26.708 --> 39:30.038
But outside...

39:31.578 --> 39:33.997
...that information fails me.

39:33.998 --> 39:35.997
I don't know how to be around people.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.497
How to prep a patient,

39:37.498 --> 39:41.828
to console her through
a devastating loss...

39:43.788 --> 39:45.748
What to say to the woman I loved....

39:47.918 --> 39:49.788
...to make her stay.

39:53.078 --> 39:55.247
Isn't it enough that I was born

39:55.248 --> 39:56.497
to do one thing well?

39:56.498 --> 39:58.247
If you're carried

39:58.248 --> 40:00.827
into that hospital, clinging to life...

40:00.828 --> 40:04.077
...you may want a doctor who's kind.

40:04.078 --> 40:07.497
Who knows just what to say
to put your heart at ease.

40:07.498 --> 40:10.207
You may want a friend.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.327
But given that choice,

40:12.328 --> 40:16.367
how many of us would want
a kind, sympathetic friend

40:16.368 --> 40:19.208
over Dr. Robeson?

40:24.288 --> 40:25.707
He saved Erica's life.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.417
And if, God forbid, you need it,

40:28.418 --> 40:30.208
he will save yours.

40:31.918 --> 40:35.288
He just won't know how to
talk to you after he does.

40:47.418 --> 40:48.917
Excuse me, Erica.

40:48.918 --> 40:50.367
You're with the defense.

40:50.368 --> 40:51.867
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

40:51.868 --> 40:54.497
Well, the jury's deliberating.
It's out of our hands now.

40:54.498 --> 40:57.577
This thing with Atticus isn't.

40:57.578 --> 40:59.287
Was there really a software glitch?

40:59.288 --> 41:00.577
I believe there was.

41:00.578 --> 41:03.417
And if you want to go after them,
I'll help you prove it.

41:03.418 --> 41:04.918
Excuse me.

41:05.918 --> 41:08.457
I'm really sorry for what happened.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.457
And-and I know it's not my place,

41:10.458 --> 41:13.327
or any consolation...

41:13.328 --> 41:15.787
but I was adopted.

41:15.788 --> 41:18.497
Not a day goes by that
I don't thank my parents

41:18.498 --> 41:20.127
for giving me a home.

41:20.128 --> 41:23.668
There are a lot of ways to make a family.

41:32.328 --> 41:35.208
All rise.

41:38.628 --> 41:40.457
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

41:40.458 --> 41:41.997
have you reached a verdict?

41:41.998 --> 41:42.998
We have.

41:44.498 --> 41:46.457
We the jury

41:46.458 --> 41:50.247
find the defendant, Terrence Robeson,

41:50.248 --> 41:51.497
not liable.

41:51.498 --> 41:53.078
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:53.081 --> 41:55.667
the court thanks you for your service.

41:55.668 --> 41:57.214
Court is adjourned.

41:59.868 --> 42:01.707
Well done, Liberty.

42:01.708 --> 42:03.958
Dr. Bull, thank you.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.328
Thank you.

42:16.578 --> 42:20.327
So... what he said on the
stand... I never knew.

42:20.328 --> 42:22.997
Well, he wanted to tell you.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.367
The god is human after all.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.747
Love him or hate him,
he has confidence enough

42:27.748 --> 42:29.417
to follow his own compass.

42:29.418 --> 42:32.367
And he doesn't let
himself get pushed around.

42:32.368 --> 42:34.537
Neither do you.

42:34.538 --> 42:37.167
Thanks.

42:37.168 --> 42:40.127
You know, I realize the reasons
that he and I didn't work

42:40.128 --> 42:41.827
are the reasons that you and I do.

42:41.828 --> 42:44.077
<i>I can spend my days</i>

42:44.078 --> 42:47.917
with a brilliant, difficult man.

42:47.918 --> 42:49.537
I just can't date him.

42:51.868 --> 42:53.537
Well, you're better off.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.627
So are you Dr. Bull.

42:55.628 --> 42:58.037
To platonic love.
