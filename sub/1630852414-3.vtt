WEBVTT

00:09.342 --> 00:10.552
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:11.052 --> 00:14.180
Hi, sweetheart. Come to Mommy.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.725
I brought her stuff
and the diapers you needed.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.602
Pablo, I know things
are terrible between us,

00:19.686 --> 00:22.772
but we'll be seeing a lot
of each other because of Regina.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.566
Come in for a bit.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.657
Thanks for giving me your classes.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.660
No, thank you for taking over.
You really helped me out.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.872
I should go.
You shouldn't be late for Omar's lesson.

00:38.955 --> 00:42.417
-You know he's picky.
-Don't worry. Teenage boys love me.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.837
My grandma should be here by now.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.633
<i>Grandma, I'm waiting for you.</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:53.845
Sorry, I can't leave my patient
in his current state.

00:54.637 --> 00:58.183
His aura is as black as tar.

01:00.435 --> 01:05.565
If I don't cleanse him, I'd be releasing
a cloud of bad vibes into the universe.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.400
You know what? Never mind.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.819
I'm really sorry, sweetie, but--

01:09.903 --> 01:12.405
What can I say? We'll talk later, bye.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.742
Regina will have to come.

01:15.825 --> 01:20.580
Can you stop by tonight after work?
I need to finish some stuff for the app.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.124
Sure, I'll let you know once I'm off work.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.042
Hey.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.004
Don't you think it's time
to put Regina in day care?

01:30.381 --> 01:31.466
-No!
-No!

01:32.926 --> 01:35.637
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:39.325 --> 02:41.369
What floor cleaner are you using, Alta?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.329
The same as always, ma'am.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.582
It's too pungent.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.917
You know what?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.752
Switch to the lavender one.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.172
Would you mind mopping again? Please.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.555
Alta!

03:02.432 --> 03:05.059
Look what the gardener
has done to my plants.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.352
Really?

03:07.228 --> 03:10.106
The grass looks dry and uneven.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.526
-Ro!
-What is it, Mom?

03:14.527 --> 03:17.155
Would you fetch me the garden shears?

03:17.238 --> 03:20.074
I'll do it myself,
but tell the gardener how it's done.

03:20.909 --> 03:21.826
-Mom.
-What?

03:21.910 --> 03:23.620
Something's burning in the kitchen.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.121
My roast!

03:32.295 --> 03:35.215
Matheus wants to take us
to a Brazilian steakhouse.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.508
You know, integration stuff.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.055
-You look terrible.
-I haven't slept well.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.057
So are you guys coming?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.017
I can't, but thanks.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.852
I'm watching my daughter.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.103
Just keep in mind,

03:49.187 --> 03:52.607
those who don't network
are left out of the picture.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.202
Okay.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.997
Can you take care of this, please?

04:10.208 --> 04:12.460
Mom, we need to talk to you.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.420
Why? You're scaring me.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.173
You drive us all crazy
when you're home all day.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.178
I'm only trying to make sure
the house is more welcoming.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.222
The house has always been welcoming.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.224
I thought I'd change up the menu.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.767
Mom, your cooking sucks.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.519
With all due respect, ma'am,

04:29.602 --> 04:31.980
you're no homemaker.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.107
You need to go back to work.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.692
Or at least find a hobby.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.151
You're exaggerating.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.028
I'm planning my next step.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.991
When I leave for the conference,
I bet you'll miss me.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.118
-You're going back to work?
-No.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.162
I'm doing it as a favor for Jorge.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.291
Whatever, Mom.
That's exactly what you need.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.542
Something to do.

04:53.042 --> 04:53.960
<i>You look terrible.</i>

04:55.295 --> 04:56.129
No.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.090
You have dark circles from lack of sleep.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.550
I don't.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.886
You're not going to the steakhouse
with everyone else?

05:04.971 --> 05:08.433
I had to finish some stuff first.
I'll catch up with them later.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.604
This is a list of day care centers
in your neighborhood.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.774
I compared the number of kids,
facilities, price points,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.027
and crazy moms, just in case…

05:19.110 --> 05:20.528
-Wow.
-…it's useful.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.114
You shouldn't have.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.033
Well, I already did.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.453
They don't want me either!

05:29.120 --> 05:32.290
In the house, I mean.
They can't wait for me to go back to work.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.084
At least they don't hate you.
Especially Ceci.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.338
You should've thought of that
before getting a mistress.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.006
I don't have a mistress!

05:40.089 --> 05:43.217
I think screwing someone
is called having a mistress.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.469
Remember Daniel?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.971
Daniel isn't my lover! He was a mistake.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.223
Well, Tere isn't my mistress!

05:49.307 --> 05:51.601
She was, and you brought her
into my house!

05:51.684 --> 05:52.894
Of course they hate you!

05:52.977 --> 05:55.813
Let's take a break from infidelity.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.317
Let's focus on the relationship
with your children.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.862
It hurts to be pushed away,

06:03.571 --> 06:04.530
especially by Ceci.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.283
It used to be Ceci and me
against Ro and Ana…

06:09.786 --> 06:11.913
I want to patch things up with Ceci.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.749
We need to spend more time together.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.044
What do you think, Ana?

06:18.961 --> 06:23.591
Yeah, I think it's a good idea
for them to spend more time together.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.229
Pablo?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.484
Hey, Pablo.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.615
Sorry, I fell asleep.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.908
I finished my work.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.537
Okay, I should go.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.957
What, barefoot?

06:58.835 --> 06:59.919
<i>Elena is right.</i>

07:01.045 --> 07:02.755
We should put Regina in day care.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.674
No, why?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.426
Look at us.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.720
Regina deserves better
than zombie parents.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.807
Besides, we need time for everything else.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.603
But she's so tiny.

07:18.563 --> 07:24.152
I can try to juggle the classes,
Regina, and the app.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.779
You don't even have time
to wax your upper lip.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.701
We could at least check out
some day care centers, okay?

07:33.828 --> 07:34.704
Thanks, Ramón.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.456
-Ana.
-Hi. Good morning.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.583
Hi, Ana. I'm glad you could make it.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.752
I wasn't expecting Manolo.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.088
Ana, will you do me a favor?

07:44.172 --> 07:46.007
Don't bring up your resignation.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.675
We don't need that noise.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.471
After this, we'll put out a statement
explaining your decision.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.140
Don't worry.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.475
-Shall we?
-Sure.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.897
-Man, it's nothing but publicity.
-No, I swear.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.318
Everyone has been asking about you.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.777
You're today's headliner.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.362
She's the what now?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.989
The keynote speaker, boss.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.617
-Oh, right.
-Keep up, Jorge.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.414
A scalper even tried to sell me
a ticket to your conference.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.332
No way!

08:19.415 --> 08:23.628
-Ana Servín.
-Marcela! How are you?

08:23.711 --> 08:26.088
-Fine, and you?
-It's so nice to see you.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.006
You too.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.967
The next conference
is still a few hours away.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.428
Shall we catch up over some coffee?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.472
-Sounds great. How are you?
-Great.

08:34.555 --> 08:35.723
How are the kids?

08:35.806 --> 08:37.391
<i>Too pretentious.</i>

08:37.475 --> 08:40.394
She kept going on and on
about the facilities.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.271
Well, I liked her.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.689
She even gave us candy.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.692
Pablo, didn't you notice
how many kids they had?

08:46.776 --> 08:49.862
Mariana, we've already seen
eight day care centers.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.156
-None are good enough.
-I can't help it.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.700
I'm not leaving Regina
in just anyone's hands.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.081
Well, this is the last one.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.416
<i>You have to learn to trust.</i>

09:03.292 --> 09:06.587
Yeah, but I'm too nervous
about this focus group.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.632
This is how Víctor will decide
whether or not to partner with us.

09:09.715 --> 09:13.219
It's going to go great. Is Víctor coming?

09:14.053 --> 09:14.887
No.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.265
He can't be judge and jury for this,

09:17.348 --> 09:20.434
but he said he'd send a friend
who is really demanding.

09:20.518 --> 09:24.438
I guess you already told Mariana
you want to partner with Víctor.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.234
Well, I'm just waiting to see
how it goes first, you know?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.198
Oli, I'm crazy about your cousin,

09:34.282 --> 09:37.159
but my dad embarrassed me
too much in front of him.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.286
He really did.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.454
What? You're not helping.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.790
Just look at him gaming.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.586
Darío is really picky.
He only goes out with gamers.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.462
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.131
Ceci!

09:57.221 --> 09:58.639
What's this? Where's Ramón?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.891
I need you to help me
decorate my apartment.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.310
Can I choose what I want?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.145
Whatever you want.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.607
Whatever I want.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.444
<i>Choosing is so difficult.</i>

10:11.527 --> 10:13.696
-We have all these questions.
-Yeah.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.907
How many years of experience
do you have caring for children?

10:16.991 --> 10:17.992
Over 20 years.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.411
How do you feel
about attachment parenting?

10:20.494 --> 10:23.164
We make sure the kids develop trust

10:23.247 --> 10:26.959
in the caregivers, in themselves,
and their environment.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.837
We also have an area
focused on the parents

10:29.920 --> 10:32.757
where we help you
establish actions at home

10:32.840 --> 10:35.509
and attachment bonds
with your little ones.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.678
Your thoughts on early stimulation?

10:37.762 --> 10:41.182
It is a teaching model
for early childhood,

10:41.265 --> 10:44.685
but we also use several others,
like neural development,

10:44.769 --> 10:47.605
embodied cognition,
socio-emotional linguistics.

10:47.688 --> 10:51.484
We channel all this
through play and exploration

10:52.151 --> 10:55.404
in contexts carefully designed
by our teachers.

10:57.406 --> 11:02.578
Have you ever had
any issues with addiction?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.497
-Do you hear voices, or--
-Mariana.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.375
-That's enough.
-Well?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.210
So?

11:09.293 --> 11:11.253
-We'll think about it.
-We'll enroll Regina.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.422
<i>You don't seem too sure.</i>

11:13.506 --> 11:16.926
I'm not sure Mariana's app will work.

11:17.009 --> 11:21.430
The idea is very good,
but the business plan is dismal,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.891
and it's overvalued.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.309
What are you going to do?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.812
I think I'm gonna pull the project.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.397
But it's a good project.

11:29.480 --> 11:34.110
That's how start-ups are.
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.321
What they need is a leader
with actual experience.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.615
On a different note,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.618
I'm so happy
about being in business together.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.994
I'm thrilled.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.997
I only accepted Jorge's proposal
because of you.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.042
Marcela, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.837
Jorge didn't mention the partnership?

11:53.337 --> 11:56.924
I guess he didn't mention
I resigned either.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.759
Bastard!

11:59.468 --> 12:00.886
He used us both.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.389
He's not getting away with it.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.434
Is this really the best?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.644
Dad, they're the latest trend.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.605
We can put the chairs in the living room.

12:11.689 --> 12:16.819
The desk, headphones, keyboard,
and console in the dining room.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.612
Please, Dad, please.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.114
Are you taking them, sir?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.700
All my friends' dads have them.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.119
How much for everything?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.708
Ana, I'm so glad you came.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.461
-Marcela, how are you?
-Oh, hi.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.671
-Come sit with us.
-Hi. Thank you.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.256
I was just telling Jorge

12:37.339 --> 12:40.301
how lovely it is
to see so many familiar faces.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.095
-Oh, it's a wonderful event, right?
-Yeah.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.389
Did you see
Rita Torreblanca's presentation?

12:46.849 --> 12:47.933
Phenomenal.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.644
Besides, we've all
experienced mansplaining.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.396
Right, we all have.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.940
How about those businessmen who brag

12:55.024 --> 12:57.234
about gender equality just to look good?

12:59.695 --> 13:03.449
You know what?
I have to make a phone call.

13:04.074 --> 13:07.077
-That's not the case in our company.
-Not at all.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.413
I'd never do business
with someone like that.

13:10.164 --> 13:14.418
We're beacons of equality
and transparency. Aren't we, Jorge?

13:15.169 --> 13:16.212
Well…

13:18.798 --> 13:19.757
What's going on?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.383
Hey, let's get out of here!

13:25.930 --> 13:27.765
<i>It's too good to be true.</i>

13:27.848 --> 13:31.143
Did you notice
not a single baby was crying?

13:31.894 --> 13:35.231
Mariana, that place was perfect.
We won't find anything better.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.984
I'm not sending Regis there
because we can't find anything better.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.569
You don't want to find anything better.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.113
Honestly, I'm tired of--

13:43.197 --> 13:44.240
What? You're tired?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.700
Are you fed up with your daughter?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.285
I'm exhausted.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.748
I can't keep working with no sleep
so you can follow your dreams.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.667
I don't have time for

13:55.626 --> 13:56.544
anything.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.295
Don't worry, Pablo.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.924
I'll manage on my own. Go get some sleep.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.467
Go get some sleep!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.511
I thought you were exhausted.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.728
What a relief it turned out to be nothing.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.399
I know, right?
Probably a jerk looking for attention.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.526
I think I know who that jerk is.

14:20.609 --> 14:24.363
Did you really think we wouldn't find out?

14:24.446 --> 14:25.739
We're friends.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.284
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Don't underestimate me.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.286
The deal is obviously off.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.581
If you thought you could
take a picture with us

14:33.664 --> 14:37.251
to impress these businesswomen,
you're mistaken, Jorge.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.253
Shall we?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.684
Are you okay?
You've been doing that for hours.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.853
Yeah, almost done.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.737
Ana.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.740
It was a terrible idea.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.241
I'm really sorry.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.744
Drop it, Jorge. Don't say a word.

15:11.827 --> 15:14.622
I'm an idiot. I blew it, Ana.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.292
Listen, the truth is, I invited you here

15:18.375 --> 15:23.631
hoping you'd reconsider
and come back to the company.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.508
And the partnership with Marcela?

15:27.259 --> 15:28.677
That was Manolo's idea.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.263
I know we didn't support you
like we should have.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.600
We have a lot to learn
when it comes to women.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.354
But the truth is,
I need you in the company.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.065
Ask me for anything,
but just come back to work.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.027
I don't know, Jorge.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.111
Think about it.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.573
<i>I can't keep pretending.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:52.034
All this stuff we bought isn't my style.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.870
It's not yours either, right?

15:55.663 --> 15:57.331
This is how people live nowadays.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.707
Relax, Dad!

15:58.791 --> 16:01.251
I'm trying, but this is
way too uncomfortable.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.630
After the way you embarrassed me,
you should try to be a cool dad.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.340
Right, Olivia?

16:16.767 --> 16:19.311
This lentil soup is delicious.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.855
You're a much better cook than me.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.191
I love my job.

16:24.274 --> 16:27.361
So much so, you didn't retire
when we brought it up.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.071
I don't regret it.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.699
I was able to open a stationery shop,

16:31.782 --> 16:34.118
and I got to keep doing what I love most.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.997
All thanks to you, ma'am.
You are the best boss.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.624
You're the best help.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.750
You know?

16:42.376 --> 16:45.504
I wish I understood what my place is,
but I just don't know.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.548
I think you do.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.720
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night, Alta.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.430
Sleep tight.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.641
<i>I wish I knew what he likes,</i>

16:57.725 --> 17:01.020
but I'm sure he'll love
these pictures. Look.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.439
Wow!

17:04.857 --> 17:05.774
He "liked" it.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.777
-He's posting a comment.
-What does it say?

17:09.361 --> 17:12.364
"Wow, I like your gadgets
and your console."

17:12.448 --> 17:13.866
"You're my type of girl."

17:15.743 --> 17:17.995
"How about a match tomorrow?"

17:19.329 --> 17:20.664
You're all set!

17:20.748 --> 17:22.708
Olivia, I don't know how to play.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.836
Darío will notice right away.
What should I do?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.605
Come on, sweetheart. Please go to sleep.

17:53.822 --> 17:57.701
FINE, LET'S SEND HER TO DAY CARE

18:06.794 --> 18:09.797
Ceci, are you okay? I'm worried about you.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.341
I couldn't sleep.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.218
No!

18:18.263 --> 18:19.765
Why am I so bad at this?

18:19.848 --> 18:22.684
It's not like you're having fun,
so who cares?

18:22.768 --> 18:23.769
It's just that…

18:26.021 --> 18:27.106
There's a boy I like.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.400
He's a gamer.
He'll never be interested in me.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.611
I can't even hold the controller.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.072
Honey, when I was in college,

18:35.697 --> 18:38.742
your mother enrolled
in every single class I was in.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.160
She had a crush on me.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.037
You know?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.748
I never realized
she did it to get my attention.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.793
Men are so basic.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.755
If you want us to get the message,
you have to make it clear, direct.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.882
If you really like this boy,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.301
you just have to be yourself.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.178
You're beautiful.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.353
Being with someone different
can be really fun.

19:06.436 --> 19:10.899
Imagine how boring it would be
being with someone just like you.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.984
Sounds lame, huh?

19:14.736 --> 19:15.737
Thanks, Dad.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.785
Be a good girl, okay?

19:27.082 --> 19:28.208
Be a good girl.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.587
It's difficult at first,
but you'll get used to it.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.880
Say bye to your parents.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.592
Did I forget her baby powder?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.051
Oh, here it is.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.805
I left her teddy bear at home.
She can't sleep without it.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.973
We should go now.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.933
Thank you.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.523
It's going to be okay.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.153
I have to run, or I'll be late.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.362
-Okay.
-Bye.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.787
<i>Don't be nervous.</i>

20:05.871 --> 20:09.833
I'm going to ask you questions
about the products you'll try.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.419
All you have to do
is tell me what you think.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.420
Okay.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.132
I'll be recording the session.
Feel free to be honest.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.050
Say hello.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.260
-Hi.
-Hi there.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.887
So when do we start?

20:21.970 --> 20:26.975
Well, now. We should be getting started,
but we're missing a guest.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.560
Let me call and ask him.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.105
Yeah, he'll be there soon.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.484
Tere, if you convince him,
you can count me in.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.320
But why is he difficult?
Can't you tell me?

20:38.403 --> 20:41.949
This guy absolutely hates
creams and lotions.

20:45.994 --> 20:46.912
Ramón?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.165
<i>Maybe it's not the best place.</i>

20:50.249 --> 20:54.127
I faced every obstacle
women face in the workplace.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.755
I put up with harassment

20:56.838 --> 21:00.509
and comments about my looks.
My qualifications were questioned.

21:00.592 --> 21:05.055
I had to work 12-hour days
to prove my commitment.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.849
I barely spent time with my family.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.812
And I made less than men
in the same position.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.147
When my children were born,

21:14.231 --> 21:17.693
and I had to miss work
for obvious reasons,

21:18.485 --> 21:21.488
I always feared one of my male colleagues

21:22.114 --> 21:24.783
would use the opportunity to take my job.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.623
Being a successful woman
in the business world isn't easy.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.500
But today,

21:34.001 --> 21:38.338
thanks to many brave women
like all of you,

21:38.422 --> 21:42.342
we're finally transforming
these unequal relationships.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.221
I'd like to thank Jorge de la Vega

21:46.305 --> 21:50.726
for ensuring that the women
in his company find their proper place.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.019
Thank you very much.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.152
I'd like to take this opportunity
to inform you all

22:01.570 --> 22:04.573
that it's finally time
for me to close a chapter.

22:04.656 --> 22:08.493
After so many years,
I'm retiring from corporate life

22:08.577 --> 22:11.788
in order to start a new path on my own.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.332
Have a good day.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.128
<i>It's a complex equation.</i>

22:18.628 --> 22:19.796
Pay attention.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.798
We're trying to solve for x, right?

22:21.882 --> 22:26.595
So, to move this two across,
we need to use division.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.555
This isn't the way Pablo taught me.

22:28.638 --> 22:32.851
-He isn't here now. I'm your teacher.
-But I like his methods much better.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.312
I bet you're one of those smarty-pants

22:35.395 --> 22:38.315
who used to tease kids
and make fun of them.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.568
I'm sure that's how you got that scar.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.073
I got it back in day care
from a girl with scissors.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.325
You're the worst teacher.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.452
Did you say day care?

22:50.535 --> 22:52.287
<i>-Good morning. Day care center.</i>
<i>-</i>Hello.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.874
I'm Regina's mom.
I'd like to know how she's doing.

22:55.957 --> 22:58.335
<i>Okay. Give me a second, yeah?</i>

22:58.418 --> 23:01.755
<i>I'm new and can't find the information</i>
<i>very well. Give me a minute.</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:03.423
Hello?

23:04.758 --> 23:05.801
<i>What a shame.</i>

23:05.884 --> 23:09.513
I would've loved to see you
tear Jorge down in front of everyone.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.100
-Your speech was fantastic.
-Thank you.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.685
But now I want to know
what's next for you.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.313
Would you believe me
if I told you I don't know?

23:18.980 --> 23:22.609
My company's doors will always be open

23:22.692 --> 23:24.820
if you ever feel like peeking in.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.906
-Thanks a lot. It was nice seeing you.
-You too.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.752
-Careful, sweetie. We should share.
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

23:40.836 --> 23:44.423
-Why aren't you stopping this?
-Nothing happened. She's not even crying.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.300
I was watching them. Really.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.762
-You can't take the baby.
-Of course I can. She's my daughter.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.807
She's being bullied,
and you didn't do anything.

23:53.890 --> 23:54.808
What's going on?

23:54.891 --> 23:57.185
You said you'd look after her,

23:57.269 --> 23:58.645
but this is the opposite.

23:58.728 --> 24:01.022
A baby tugged at her hair.
I was watching them.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.900
You say it like it's nothing!
Unbelievable!

24:03.984 --> 24:08.155
-I'm taking my baby home.
-I'll let you do that just this once.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.407
You know what? Don't worry.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.118
This is the last time
we ever set foot in this place.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.911
I didn't say anything.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.538
<i>I'm sorry I'm not perfect.</i>

24:16.621 --> 24:18.039
I'm not a gamer.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.584
In fact, I suck at video games.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.087
So, why did you post those pictures?

24:24.796 --> 24:25.839
To impress you.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.758
Why do you want to impress me?

24:28.842 --> 24:30.218
Because I like you.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.806
Ceci.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.641
I'll teach you.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.230
Those kids don't know how to play, huh?

24:43.648 --> 24:44.524
Pablo?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.569
What are you doing? Why are you hiding?

24:48.570 --> 24:49.404
I'm not.

24:49.488 --> 24:55.035
The thing is, I got off early
to stop by to pick up Regina.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.370
Why did you pick her up?

24:58.538 --> 25:00.540
I was also worried sick.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.501
She was being mistreated.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.044
-By a teacher?
-No, a girl.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.629
She was pulling her hair.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.510
-This is harder than I thought.
-I know.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.677
Hold on.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.179
Shit.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.431
Omar's mother just fired me.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.892
I left in the middle of a lesson.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.602
I walked out of a meeting.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.187
I may get fired too.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.773
We can't go on like this, Mariana.

25:25.273 --> 25:28.193
We both have to work
to give Regina a good life.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.820
Plus, we both have dreams, don't we?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.491
We have to let go
and not be so apprehensive.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.034
Oh!

25:37.077 --> 25:38.328
She pulled my hair!

25:39.704 --> 25:41.206
See? She can defend herself.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.878
I'd like to know what you do
to take care of yourselves.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.422
Nothing. All I do is take a shower.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.758
It takes me 40 minutes to shave.

25:51.841 --> 25:52.717
Chava?

25:53.802 --> 25:57.430
I use chamomile to lighten my hair color.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.516
Well done, you.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.809
I also…

26:01.309 --> 26:03.895
I'm addicted to pedicures.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.438
That's awesome!

26:05.522 --> 26:08.775
Now that your face is cleansed,
I want you to touch your skin

26:08.858 --> 26:10.443
and tell me how it feels.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.613
-Nice.
-Right?

26:13.697 --> 26:14.531
Yeah.

26:15.031 --> 26:15.865
Ramón?

26:24.332 --> 26:25.500
It does feel softer.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.378
Shall we do manicures?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.213
Yeah!

26:34.342 --> 26:35.969
You were right about everything.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.888
So what are we going to do
with all the stuff we bought?

26:38.972 --> 26:41.308
Invite friends to play video games.

26:41.391 --> 26:45.437
Yeah, right.
I don't think it's their thing.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.316
I know you're still upset
about what happened with Mom,

26:49.399 --> 26:51.109
but you need a little distraction.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.819
You may be right.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.154
<i>Good night.</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:56.531
<i>He's married.</i>

26:56.615 --> 26:57.991
Married.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.248
Pablo, what are you doing tomorrow?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.208
<i>I'd do this again.</i>

27:07.292 --> 27:08.877
<i>And the prices are reasonable.</i>

27:08.960 --> 27:10.587
<i>Plus, you look younger.</i>

27:10.670 --> 27:13.715
-What do you think?
-That's all I needed to hear.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.718
That's why I sent Ramón.
He's a tough cookie.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.386
It'll be a success.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.555
Thank you!

27:20.639 --> 27:22.682
Consider us partners, partner.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.894
Thank you so much, partner.

27:25.977 --> 27:30.065
The next step is talking
to Mariana and Juan Carlos

27:30.148 --> 27:32.067
to avoid misunderstandings.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.318
Of course, sure.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.529
But we should celebrate over dinner.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.572
Of course.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.074
Let's go.

27:39.574 --> 27:40.992
<i>I'll pick her up at 5:00.</i>

27:41.076 --> 27:42.619
Not a minute earlier.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.413
-Sorry about making a scene.
-Don't worry.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.624
You're not the first mom to panic.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.377
I cried when I dropped off
my eldest at kindergarten.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.629
All right, let's do this.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.508
Goodbye, sweetie.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.094
-Bye, baby.
-Bye.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.178
Goodbye.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.355
<i>When are you going back to work?</i>

28:10.438 --> 28:13.024
I'm sure you got a ton of offers.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.694
I'm not sure it's the right time.

28:16.569 --> 28:18.947
My family is fracturing, Mom.

28:19.614 --> 28:22.659
Of course the separation affects the kids,

28:22.742 --> 28:25.620
but you don't need
to put your life on hold.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.206
You are who you are, Ana.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.958
And you love working.

28:30.041 --> 28:33.002
I have to make an effort to fix things.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.422
Juan Carlos is really trying.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.507
He reached out to Ceci,

28:38.216 --> 28:41.428
and I feel I should focus
on my children a bit more.

28:41.511 --> 28:46.433
He's the one who cheated.
He should face the consequences.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.644
The truth is, I haven't been
completely honest either.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.605
I also cheated on Juan Carlos.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.111
It was only one time
on a business trip, but…

28:59.904 --> 29:02.282
-You're such a hypocrite.
-Honey--

29:02.365 --> 29:05.744
How could you blame it all on Dad
and play the victim?

29:05.827 --> 29:08.621
-Ceci--
-No, Mom. I'm leaving.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.373
I'm staying with Dad.

29:13.918 --> 29:14.836
Oh!

29:21.885 --> 29:25.388
-Hey, it's us!
-Ready to have some shots?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.557
-What's up? I'll put the drinks there.
-Okay.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.517
-Hi.
-What's up, JC?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.811
-Hey!
-I didn't know you were a gamer.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.062
Not me, Ceci.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.315
She likes a boy who's a gamer.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.358
As a single dad, I gave in.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.903
Hey, JC, can I invite some friends over?

29:39.986 --> 29:40.820
They're awesome.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.530
Sure. Of course.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.615
This place is great.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.075
Wait!

29:47.035 --> 29:48.119
Hi.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.205
Hello.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.587
-You'll love this restaurant.
-I'm so excited!

29:57.670 --> 30:00.882
I have so many great ideas for Rorros.

30:00.965 --> 30:04.427
-Rorros? Sounds great, yeah.
-It's cool, right?

30:06.679 --> 30:07.931
What is it, Juanqui?

30:08.014 --> 30:10.600
Remember the whiskey I left in your car?

30:11.684 --> 30:13.061
<i>Could you bring it over?</i>

30:13.603 --> 30:15.980
I'm kind of busy right now.

30:16.064 --> 30:20.360
It's just that there's a party,
spur of the moment, they're drinking rum.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.736
You know I hate it.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.279
Fine, I'll be there in ten.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.200
I'm not setting foot
in your brother's apartment.

30:27.283 --> 30:30.578
Relax. You wait downstairs,
I'll run upstairs, give him the bottle,

30:30.662 --> 30:32.038
and we pick up Lorena.

30:34.040 --> 30:34.958
Okay.

30:44.217 --> 30:48.263
Besides-- No, this blockade is no good.
It doesn't work.

30:48.346 --> 30:51.349
-No!
-Hell yeah! I beat you again!

30:51.432 --> 30:55.019
I want a rematch.
This controller is faulty.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.397
It was the controller. It wasn't my fault.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.735
Ana, what are you doing here?

31:03.236 --> 31:07.866
Ceci asked me to bring her over,
but I'm not leaving her in this den.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.033
Well--

31:09.117 --> 31:11.119
I organized a small gathering,

31:11.202 --> 31:14.581
but a lot more people showed up.

31:14.664 --> 31:18.001
-I'm staying with Dad.
-You're coming with me.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.544
-What? No!
-Let's go.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.638
Ana--

31:30.722 --> 31:32.599
-At least let me explain.
-Let's go.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.101
Please, Ana.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.563
Ana, it's not what it looks like. Really.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.649
Let's go.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.860
You and Dad are liars!

31:43.943 --> 31:45.320
And you know what?

31:45.403 --> 31:48.406
I don't need either of you
to make sacrifices for me.

31:48.489 --> 31:52.285
If you think you'll fix things
by staying home, you're so wrong.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.871
What more proof do you need?

32:08.176 --> 32:09.260
What happened?

32:10.303 --> 32:13.014
I ran into Ana and Ceci.
See why I didn't want to come?

32:13.097 --> 32:13.932
Relax.

32:14.015 --> 32:17.268
Tere, wait. We'll clear everything up.
Look at me. I promise.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.448
Marcela?

32:31.032 --> 32:32.533
Sorry to call so late,

32:32.617 --> 32:34.577
but you're probably working, right?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.581
I know what's next for me.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.335
Well, I was really surprised
to get your call last night,

32:42.418 --> 32:45.213
but I'm really happy
the app is back on track.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.674
Welcome to the new offices

32:47.757 --> 32:50.802
for what will be Mexico's best baby app.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.762
Our offices are here

32:52.845 --> 32:55.848
because this place
supports female entrepreneurs.

32:55.932 --> 33:00.353
90% of our businesses are run by women.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.313
That's amazing.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.149
Where can I get settled?
I can't wait to get started.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.528
I'll tell you in a minute.
First, meet your new boss.

33:08.611 --> 33:11.239
Although I think
you already know each other.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.867
Hi, Mariana.

34:30.651 --> 34:35.615
