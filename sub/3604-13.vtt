It's very important
that we find our friend
Hiro Nakamura. Look.

See, this may
not make any sense
but we can't find him

Now it’s up to us

some choose self/essness,

the need to devote oneself
to something greater,

01:43.187 --> 01:45.849
while others know
only self interest,

01:45.940 --> 01:48.852

in a world

01:51.487 --> 01:54.695
while others are driven
by fear and betrayal.

see their choices as
dark proof of God’s absence,

Sylar, huh?

02:33.696 --> 02:36.608
There was no other way

lied to me.

a mother and a family

You broke my heart, Peter.
Stop.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.557
Son of a bitch.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.426
PETER: No,
Nathan, don't...

34:42.331 --> 34:43.662
(GRUNTING)

34:47.419 --> 34:48.408
(FLINT GRUNTS)

34:59.306 --> 35:02.093
So, you killed Arthur.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.514
I certainly did.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.147
Then you saved
the world.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.018
l was right about you
all along.

35:15.364 --> 35:16.945
You are a hero.

35:19.243 --> 35:22.110
I don't think so.
You're wrong.

35:24.164 --> 35:28.498
I always wanted
this for you.
I dreamed about it.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.335
And now that Arthur
is dead, there's no one
to hold you back,

35:32.423 --> 35:34.038
no one to take
advantage of you.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.295
Exceptyou.

35:39.013 --> 35:41.550
Gabriel, I cared for you.

35:42.057 --> 35:45.970
I gave you love,
I gave you guidance,
everything a mother...

35:46.061 --> 35:47.471
(SYLAR GRUNTING)

35:47.563 --> 35:50.976
You are not my mother.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.355
Are you?

36:00.909 --> 36:03.036
And I can tell
if you're lying.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.791
No, I'm not.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.084
For a brief moment,
I wished you were.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.424
Why did you do it?
I told you.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.602
My sons have been
such a disappointment to me,

36:30.689 --> 36:32.930
and I wanted
another chance,

36:33.317 --> 36:36.605
a chance to give the love
that only a mother can.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.568
That's a lie.

36:42.409 --> 36:43.945
(CHOKING)

36:47.122 --> 36:49.158
I told you I could tell.

36:52.795 --> 36:55.502
I wanted you to work
for the Company.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.963
You had a skill
that I needed.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.749
You saw me as a hero?

37:04.306 --> 37:05.386
No.

37:07.017 --> 37:10.475
As a killer, a monster.

37:12.022 --> 37:15.480
(SIGHING)
You were flawed,
weak, malleable,

37:16.068 --> 37:18.480
someone I could manipulate
because that's what I do,

37:18.570 --> 37:22.062
because you're right,
I'm a monster, too.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.151
(GROANING)

37:24.243 --> 37:26.234
Is there any good
in this world?

37:26.328 --> 37:27.568
Tell me something.
Anything.

37:27.663 --> 37:30.325
Just make me believe
that you're not
the same as me.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.998
(GASPING)
I know who your
real parents are.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.380
(EXHALES)

37:38.006 --> 37:39.337
You're telling the truth.

37:39.508 --> 37:43.592
You're not the son of
a watchmaker and a woman
who collected snow globes.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.260
Who am I then?

37:46.265 --> 37:50.099
If you kill me,
you will never find out.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.344
(GASPING)

37:54.440 --> 37:55.680
Tell me.

37:58.360 --> 38:02.945
Tell me.
I want the truth!

38:03.031 --> 38:04.020
(GRUNTS)

38:10.873 --> 38:12.238
(BEEPING)

38:19.673 --> 38:20.879
Claire.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.541
We need to leave. Now.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.044
Get Angela out of here.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.055
Mom!

38:34.146 --> 38:35.226
Claire!

38:35.397 --> 38:37.058
No. No. What are
you doing here?

38:37.149 --> 38:40.141
I told you I'd come
back for you. Come on.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.727
Claire, okay,
let's go.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.152
This whole building
is gonna come down in flames.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.319
We'll be buried alive.
Come on.

38:45.407 --> 38:46.738
No, I can save you.
No, get away.

38:46.825 --> 38:47.985
(GROANS)

38:48.076 --> 38:49.657
We have to get out of here.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.235
You gotta go.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.577
I love you, Mom.

38:55.751 --> 38:56.866
Go!

38:57.419 --> 38:58.534
(CRYING) Oh, God.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.418
Go.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.290
(SCREAMING)

39:14.019 --> 39:15.429
(BOTH GRUNTING)

39:19.608 --> 39:22.941
You flew!
That wasn't me,
that was you!

39:23.278 --> 39:25.109
You took the formula.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.939
I had to.
Everything you're against.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.492
I had no other choice.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.950
Why'd you save me?
Why'd you do it?

39:32.037 --> 39:33.447
(PANTING)

39:33.956 --> 39:36.663
Because you're my brother
and I love you.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.457
It's not what
I would've done.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.676
Nathan. Nathan!

39:49.763 --> 39:51.219
(WHOOSHING)

39:54.977 --> 39:57.639
MOH/NDER: There is good
and there is evil,

39:58.647 --> 40:03.983
right and wrong,
heroes and villains.

40:04.486 --> 40:06.647
And if we’re blessed
with wisdom,

40:06.822 --> 40:09.188
then there are glimpses
between the cracks of each

40:09.324 --> 40:11.531
where light streams through.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.495
We wait in silence
for these times

40:17.583 --> 40:19.494
when sense can be made,

40:21.211 --> 40:24.169
when meaningless existence
comes into focus

40:24.840 --> 40:27.252
and our purpose
presents itself.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.336
And if we have
the strength to be honest,

40:32.431 --> 40:37.516
then what we find there
staring back at us
is our own reflection,

40:39.354 --> 40:42.187
bearing witness
to the duality of life.

40:43.817 --> 40:48.652
That each one of us
is capable of both
the dark and the light,

40:49.323 --> 40:51.314
of good and evil,

40:52.075 --> 40:54.236
of either, of all.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.529
And destiny,
while marching ever
in our direction,

40:59.166 --> 41:01.953
can be rerouted by
the choices we make,

41:06.006 --> 41:11.091
by the love we hold on to
and the promises we keep.

41:24.191 --> 41:25.931
I think our only
real option at this point

41:26.026 --> 41:27.857
is to get the Unites States
Government involved.

41:35.869 --> 41:39.361
And you're saying
all of these people
have abilities.

41:39.623 --> 41:42.831
Them and more. A lot more.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.498
The important thing
to remember

41:44.586 --> 41:47.828
is how dangerous
these people can become
if left unchecked.

41:48.340 --> 41:52.674
I had a solution.
It proved unsuccessful.

41:54.346 --> 41:57.304
It's all there.
All the evidence you need.

41:58.975 --> 42:02.058
What exactly is it
that you're asking to do?

42:02.979 --> 42:04.935
I want to round them up
and put them in a facility

42:05.023 --> 42:07.400
where they won't be
a danger to anyone.

42:11.321 --> 42:14.905
All right, Senator.
Let's get you
whatever you need.

42:20.122 --> 42:22.204
Thank you,
Mr. President.
