00:27.402 --> 00:28.854
I gotta hit the head.

00:53.906 --> 00:55.795
I can't take
this shit, Bunny.

00:56.546 --> 00:57.332
Hey

00:58.423 --> 00:59.278
It'll pass.

01:01.425 --> 01:02.721
They're just
riding you now.

01:02.903 --> 01:04.756
Next week it's somebody new.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.416
Can't take away
your E.O.D., Marvin.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.464
Worst they can do is bust
you back to lieutenant.

01:12.730 --> 01:14.289
I don't even
wanna think about

01:14.290 --> 01:16.037
the worst these
motherfuckers can do.

01:17.384 --> 01:18.380
You don't either.

01:23.141 --> 01:25.675
You're still not connecting
the dots, Marvin.

01:27.786 --> 01:28.926
Have a look.

01:31.023 --> 01:32.618
Hoffman and Holbrook, Sir.

01:32.946 --> 01:33.731
Very good.

01:34.388 --> 01:36.016
You had a body drop
there last week

01:36.039 --> 01:38.338
and this is what the fuck
it looked like yesterday.

01:39.441 --> 01:40.355
Bond and Preston

01:41.119 --> 01:41.998
for the record.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.624
Ashland and Wolfe.

01:46.582 --> 01:47.603
Chase and Durham.

01:48.729 --> 01:52.459
Sir, I deployed my resources
per your instructions.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.218
We beefed up foot patrols.

01:54.839 --> 01:57.608
We have our plainclothes
squads on 12-hour shifts.

01:58.012 --> 01:59.302
And the corners stay full?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.604
They move, Sir.

02:01.226 --> 02:02.169
Everyday

02:02.937 --> 02:04.802
they're gonna
sell their drugs somewhere.

02:05.224 --> 02:06.033
Major Taylor.

02:06.854 --> 02:10.161
I look at your numbers, I see
the intel reports, the photos.

02:11.827 --> 02:14.709
It all tells me
that you lack a fucking clue.

02:15.505 --> 02:16.772
If you'll permit me.

02:18.485 --> 02:19.928
Is your Deputy Major present?

02:20.678 --> 02:21.545
Yes, Sir.

02:24.766 --> 02:26.958
You now command
the Eastern District.

02:27.991 --> 02:29.833
Major Taylor,
you are relieved.

02:30.842 --> 02:31.791
Take the podium.

02:42.241 --> 02:45.150
Anyone else having trouble
with the writing on the wall?

02:46.364 --> 02:47.138
Dismissed.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.355
Dead Soldiers

04:26.289 --> 04:30.418
And I'm like "nigger if you want
to sell me a new car

04:30.546 --> 04:32.271
you better really sell it to me

04:32.294 --> 04:35.507
'cause otherwise, I'm sittin'
back and I'm watchin'."

04:35.812 --> 04:37.358
What you want
with a new ride for?

04:37.687 --> 04:39.563
It ain't like you
can't get a new car

04:39.587 --> 04:41.967
anywhere you want,
anytime, this whole city.

04:42.202 --> 04:43.985
- I'm just sayin'.
- Sayin' what?

04:44.207 --> 04:45.991
- In case.
- In case what?

04:46.355 --> 04:48.817
In case I ever want
to buy a new car.

04:48.852 --> 04:51.046
Damn, is that too
much to ask for?

04:51.608 --> 04:52.664
Girl, you crazy.

04:52.934 --> 04:54.728
Shit, shit,
Get down. Get down.

05:16.669 --> 05:17.877
Yeah, they filling it now.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.152
They protectin'
the fuck out of it, too.

05:21.118 --> 05:22.313
You see what you wanted?

05:23.439 --> 05:23.984
Yeah, man.

05:24.002 --> 05:26.788
But they got the whole
second floor boarded up.

05:26.806 --> 05:28.224
Got a little
porch 'round back.

05:28.259 --> 05:30.758
Couple of the boys out there
now smoking on them menthols.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.432
So we slide up from the back?

05:34.074 --> 05:35.094
It barred up, too.

05:35.798 --> 05:37.018
No way through the front?

05:37.275 --> 05:38.020
Not now.

05:38.426 --> 05:40.681
Come tomorrow morning
they gonna scale back down

05:40.704 --> 05:42.628
to a three-man skeleton crew,
ya feel me?

05:43.109 --> 05:44.387
Not sure I like this.

05:45.923 --> 05:48.762
Why we gotta keep hitting up
the Barksdale people?

05:48.879 --> 05:50.767
Ain't like this whole
motherfuckin' city

05:50.790 --> 05:52.162
ain't got stashes all over it.

05:52.679 --> 05:53.396
True that.

05:54.205 --> 05:54.986
So why?

05:57.881 --> 05:58.591
Because.

05:59.629 --> 06:00.409
Because?

06:02.121 --> 06:02.824
Indeed.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.556
So that's a cop shooter?

06:13.705 --> 06:15.077
Yeah, not much to him

06:16.133 --> 06:18.419
but he did the job on
the Dozerman kid last week.

06:18.432 --> 06:20.039
We gave it up
in a full statement.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.430
Before or after you knocked
the shit out of him?

06:25.877 --> 06:28.610
Injuries were sustained while
patrol officers were effecting

06:28.633 --> 06:31.765
pursuit and rest
of aforementioned suspect.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.982
He was caught
Eastside, right?

06:34.573 --> 06:36.919
But the wagon made
a stop at the Western District

06:36.955 --> 06:38.584
for an unscheduled tune-up.

06:40.344 --> 06:41.727
It's dark on that backlot.

06:43.592 --> 06:45.443
Western boys mistook
him for a pinata.

06:47.377 --> 06:48.399
So what do you think?

06:48.563 --> 06:52.046
I think this is a tragic motherfuckin'
miscarriage of justice.

06:52.891 --> 06:55.303
I think it deserves
a special grand jury

06:55.326 --> 06:57.297
and if not, the president
should appoint

06:57.309 --> 06:58.494
an independent prosecutor.

06:58.563 --> 07:00.102
Oh, no, no, no, actually

07:01.203 --> 07:03.666
I think Kofi Bryant
an' the United fucking Nations

07:03.688 --> 07:04.779
should get involved.

07:05.306 --> 07:06.221
It's a murder, Bunk.

07:06.949 --> 07:09.424
The word from upstairs is that
we supposed to be havin'

07:09.434 --> 07:10.421
less murders, not more.

07:10.443 --> 07:13.247
This is Anne Arundel county.
Why should they care about that?

07:13.299 --> 07:14.072
Why should you?

07:14.166 --> 07:15.667
Hey, Bunk.
Hey, how's it going?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.627
Listen, um, Deputy
wants to know.

07:17.649 --> 07:19.655
Have we recovered
Dozerman's service weapon?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.813
No, Sir. The kid says he sold
it on the street.

07:21.837 --> 07:23.549
Gave only the street
name of the buyer.

07:23.572 --> 07:25.460
A certain Peanut,
whereabouts unknown.

07:25.495 --> 07:26.586
They want that gun back.

07:27.326 --> 07:27.783
Sir?

07:27.877 --> 07:30.516
They don't want to have a departmental
weapon on the street.

07:30.539 --> 07:31.642
You know, as a principle.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.539
The great white
deputy has spoken.

07:34.843 --> 07:37.089
This case is not down
until the gun comes home.

07:37.969 --> 07:38.884
Fine, don't get up.

07:39.974 --> 07:42.754
One of the most heavily armed
cities in the gun-loving world,

07:42.777 --> 07:44.612
why should those
ignorant motherfuckers

07:44.630 --> 07:47.018
care about one got-damn
semiauto, more or less?

07:58.079 --> 08:00.412
What'd you bring me downtown
in this shit for, man?

08:00.447 --> 08:01.562
Police don't get whif.

08:05.115 --> 08:06.264
Talk to me, big man.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.494
Thought you should know,
my boy Cheese,

08:08.564 --> 08:10.699
he went into the box
with a couple of police.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.029
He stood tall?

08:12.422 --> 08:12.985
No doubt.

08:13.009 --> 08:14.861
Kept his mouth shut
and waited 'em out.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.830
Way it turned out,
they the ones that fucked up.

08:19.780 --> 08:20.285
How come?

08:20.976 --> 08:23.452
Police let it slip
Cheese played in some talkies.

08:24.308 --> 08:25.492
Tried to pin a hit on him.

08:26.068 --> 08:27.286
Said they had it all over.

08:27.955 --> 08:28.753
Who got hit?

08:29.238 --> 08:30.025
A dog.

08:30.798 --> 08:31.501
What kinda dog?

08:32.193 --> 08:34.105
Kind mistake
your leg for pussy.

08:38.011 --> 08:40.155
So, they had phones tapped?

08:41.491 --> 08:43.392
Don't matter to me
none if they did.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.484
Me and the people I keep close,
we don't talk on the phone none.

08:48.552 --> 08:49.937
You talk on the phone, String?

08:51.320 --> 08:52.305
So we good then.

08:52.962 --> 08:55.719
What we know is they
still looking hard at us.

08:58.146 --> 09:01.074
You wanna know what kills more
police than bullets and liquor?

09:02.118 --> 09:02.899
Boredom.

09:03.421 --> 09:05.074
They jus' can't
handle that shit.

09:06.997 --> 09:08.612
You keep it boring, String.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.958
You keep it dead
fucking boring.

09:22.108 --> 09:22.841
You're serious?

09:24.091 --> 09:24.829
I am.

09:25.979 --> 09:27.585
What's the closest
school to here?

09:27.620 --> 09:28.571
Stuart Hill elementary.

09:29.754 --> 09:31.068
That's at least eight blocks.

09:38.066 --> 09:38.817
Three sevens.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.131
Three sevens?

09:42.054 --> 09:42.818
Five eights.

09:44.964 --> 09:45.996
Bullshit, let's see it.

09:46.664 --> 09:47.556
Five eights.

09:47.814 --> 09:48.611
Read 'em an' weep.

09:49.491 --> 09:50.277
You're cheating.

09:50.781 --> 09:52.365
I just can't catch
your ass is all.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.426
It's just luck, Tony.

09:54.070 --> 09:54.832
It's just luck.

09:55.876 --> 09:57.413
You called my desk
looking for me?

09:57.436 --> 09:58.656
Yes, I did, come on in.

09:58.750 --> 09:59.547
Grab a chair.

09:59.781 --> 10:01.277
But watch your
wallet if you do.

10:03.242 --> 10:04.304
Make it quick, Tommy.

10:04.890 --> 10:06.109
The new city editor wants

10:06.122 --> 10:08.385
a 40-inch weekender
on liquor board reform.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.533
They're going to reform
the liquor board?

10:10.556 --> 10:11.869
Yeah, with a hand grenade.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.288
So what's on your mind?

10:17.941 --> 10:18.950
We're off the record?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.984
There's going to be
no academy class

10:23.008 --> 10:24.216
of police cadets this year.

10:24.251 --> 10:25.096
Mayor's orders.

10:26.073 --> 10:28.031
Homicide rate's climbing,
felonies are up

10:28.032 --> 10:29.943
we got patrol
vacancies out the ass.

10:30.355 --> 10:32.501
Even more coming
at the year-end retirements.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.423
And this is coming
from his honor?

10:34.800 --> 10:35.504
To what end?

10:35.866 --> 10:36.808
Keep some money.

10:37.324 --> 10:39.564
Money's in the budget,
but even a six-month delay

10:39.588 --> 10:41.159
in hiring saves
a couple million.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.068
You think there's some paper,
something the Mayor signed?

10:44.091 --> 10:45.850
Nah, but you call
the personnel office

10:45.859 --> 10:48.603
and they'll confirm that
the class is delayed until next year.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.588
You get that much

10:49.764 --> 10:51.974
you can come back to me
for a couple of quotes.

10:53.681 --> 10:54.655
You want in on this?

10:54.901 --> 10:55.663
No indeed.

10:56.367 --> 10:57.384
I love my mayor.

10:57.654 --> 10:58.570
Councilman, thank you.

11:01.642 --> 11:02.698
Stirring up some shit.

11:02.909 --> 11:03.825
Just a little bit.

11:04.469 --> 11:06.487
For the good of our
fair city by the bay.

11:08.898 --> 11:09.790
Three twos.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.499
Housing authority has this
slated for demolition, right?

11:18.816 --> 11:20.423
But no money to do it yet.

11:21.736 --> 11:23.237
Boss, you sure
it's a good idea

11:23.249 --> 11:25.138
not to tell anyone
about this downtown?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.184
Ignorance is bliss,
Lieutenant.

11:27.818 --> 11:29.085
Anyone ever tell you that?

11:29.519 --> 11:32.381
Once, but I beat the dog-piss
out of the guy with a nightstick.

11:33.847 --> 11:35.243
Anybody seen McNulty?

11:37.613 --> 11:38.904
Catch him up when he posts.

11:40.486 --> 11:41.243
New target.

11:41.636 --> 11:42.692
Kintel Williamson

11:43.431 --> 11:44.404
goes by Prince K.

11:45.459 --> 11:47.851
Has a string of corners from
Park Circle to Woodland Avenue.

11:48.388 --> 11:49.747
And he's dropping bodies, too.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.859
Three in the last four months

11:52.117 --> 11:54.274
or so say our friends
in the Northwestern District.

11:54.778 --> 11:56.561
So we're off
Proposition Joe's people?

11:56.668 --> 11:59.481
We're going to ship the mid-level
arrests downtown to C.I.D.

11:59.679 --> 12:01.544
Let narcotics work
up those prosecutions.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.361
After that, we're
on to new business.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.449
He don't look like much.

12:05.825 --> 12:06.892
He's dropping bodies.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.093
And with everybody pressed
to bring the murder rate down

12:10.105 --> 12:11.887
that's the new mandate
for this unit.

12:11.934 --> 12:13.507
Bell has bodies on him, too.

12:13.589 --> 12:14.358
Not lately.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.001
And Prop Joe hasn't
made much noise either.

12:17.283 --> 12:18.912
They're still running product.

12:19.099 --> 12:20.859
Still got kids
banging out there.

12:21.163 --> 12:24.026
And now, 'cause we blew
a wire over a fucking dog

12:24.331 --> 12:26.044
we have to let
them just walk on

12:26.442 --> 12:28.553
go about their shit
like we were never anything

12:28.577 --> 12:30.304
to take seriously
in the first place?

12:42.208 --> 12:45.023
I want an investigative strategy
mapped out by week's end.

12:50.294 --> 12:52.218
McNulty's here
in spirit anyway.

12:54.108 --> 12:54.676
What?

13:19.992 --> 13:20.637
Right there.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.159
This will work, too.

14:16.547 --> 14:19.502
There's a couple
occupied in the 200 block

14:20.230 --> 14:21.367
and that one over there

14:22.258 --> 14:25.297
but, otherwise...

14:27.455 --> 14:28.077
we're good.

14:30.799 --> 14:33.086
Good shit, right?

14:35.091 --> 14:35.572
Let's go.

14:36.627 --> 14:37.877
Commissioner Burrell, please.

14:37.888 --> 14:38.984
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

14:39.003 --> 14:40.104
It's Councilman Carcetti.

14:40.116 --> 14:40.973
<i>Hold please. </i>

14:41.806 --> 14:42.275
<i>Hello. </i>

14:42.487 --> 14:43.918
Erv, I'm givin'
you a heads up.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.591
You're gonna get a call
from a Sun papers reporter

14:46.615 --> 14:47.670
about the academy class.

14:47.698 --> 14:49.081
<i>What the fuck, is this a joke?</i>

14:49.116 --> 14:51.546
Calm the hell down, Erv.
You just no-comment the fucker.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.809
<i>You tellin' me my name
will be no where near this</i>

14:53.844 --> 14:55.239
<i>and then send a reporter my way. </i>

14:55.363 --> 14:57.332
Exactly. Then you call
the mayor yourself

14:57.367 --> 14:59.569
and you tell him you
got a reporter nosing around

14:59.580 --> 15:01.351
about the academy
class getting pushed.

15:01.363 --> 15:03.357
You tell him you
have no idea how it leaked.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.069
<i>I know this shit's
coming back to me. </i>

15:05.104 --> 15:06.535
Trust me you're
covered on this.

15:06.558 --> 15:07.118
<i>Goddamn it. </i>

15:07.142 --> 15:09.453
<i>You can't hang me out there
like this with the Mayor. </i>

15:09.477 --> 15:11.001
<i>My ass is flapping
in the breeze. </i>

15:11.024 --> 15:13.031
You want that class, Erv.
You gotta trust me.

15:13.054 --> 15:13.499
<i>Shit!</i>

15:30.963 --> 15:32.089
How you even find me?

15:32.969 --> 15:34.283
Ran into Lukas.

15:34.435 --> 15:35.891
Don't even call his nigger.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.743
Nigger still owes me money.

15:38.259 --> 15:40.449
He just told me
how to find you that's all.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.428
He tell you how I'm doing?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.429
I know what you thinking.

15:51.658 --> 15:53.277
You ain't looking
all that yourself.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.424
You look just fine, girl.

15:56.011 --> 15:58.040
Just tryin' to find
your sister that's all.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.163
She ain't for you no more.

16:01.993 --> 16:03.671
She ain't for none of our kind.

16:06.307 --> 16:07.646
Gone out county-way.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.888
Picked herself up.

16:09.545 --> 16:11.644
County clothes, county car.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.552
County nose to look down
on all us city niggers with.

16:18.862 --> 16:20.011
She a teacher.

16:21.466 --> 16:22.041
Where at?

16:22.076 --> 16:23.846
Don't be rushin' me,
motherfucker.

16:29.043 --> 16:30.990
I know you lookin'
to tip on out of here

16:31.012 --> 16:32.384
get your aftershave on

16:32.713 --> 16:33.744
get yourself correct.

16:42.736 --> 16:43.722
She teach speech.

16:45.234 --> 16:48.554
Make it so every nigger
sound like Condo-Lisa.

16:56.092 --> 16:57.499
Up by the B. Wells.

17:08.406 --> 17:09.467
'Scuse me, Sir.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.811
'Scuse me, have you
seen this little girl?

17:12.107 --> 17:12.715
This my baby.

17:12.728 --> 17:14.675
Can you just take
that picture with you?

17:14.711 --> 17:16.246
Thank you so much, god bless.

17:16.973 --> 17:18.681
'Scuse me, have you
seen this little girl

17:18.693 --> 17:20.054
Lady, you gonna
have to back up.

17:20.076 --> 17:22.317
She's my little girl.
Please, she's only four years old.

17:22.353 --> 17:24.898
I ain't seen your little girl,
you're gonna have to back up.

17:24.916 --> 17:27.477
- Please, just take a look at her!
- I ain't seen your...

17:27.497 --> 17:27.957
How do?

17:52.954 --> 17:53.681
Let's go.

17:54.572 --> 17:55.429
Where it at, man?

18:00.222 --> 18:00.795
Back there.

18:11.448 --> 18:13.395
So, what up, man?
You don't value my time?

18:13.417 --> 18:14.379
Nigga, please.

18:15.365 --> 18:17.841
Hand me that screw gun
and calm the fuck down.

19:18.593 --> 19:19.450
Go! Go!

19:21.115 --> 19:21.561
Clear!

19:22.907 --> 19:23.775
Tosha go!

19:24.513 --> 19:25.780
Dante, go, I got your back!

19:26.941 --> 19:28.383
Oh, I got you, baby.
I got you.

19:29.968 --> 19:30.894
Go! Go!

19:32.953 --> 19:33.740
Go! Go!

20:17.111 --> 20:17.850
Yo, y'all ready.

20:20.699 --> 20:21.556
Let's bang out.

20:31.496 --> 20:32.986
Go, go, go!

20:33.128 --> 20:33.491
Go!

21:01.783 --> 21:03.164
Come on, Kimmy,
get in the car!

21:03.281 --> 21:04.548
Get in the car, man.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.595
Your department leaks
like a fucking sieve.

21:20.393 --> 21:22.621
It could be someone
over here at the hall.

21:23.219 --> 21:25.837
Someone on your staff.
Someone on the Council.

21:26.013 --> 21:27.316
Well, it doesn't matter now.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.392
We gotta spin it
the best way we can,

21:29.404 --> 21:30.929
which means,
we need you to step up

21:30.939 --> 21:32.535
and take this one
for the team, Erv.

21:32.558 --> 21:32.945
Me?

21:33.608 --> 21:35.825
Tell the newspaper
that the academy class

21:35.860 --> 21:37.385
has been delayed
for some reason.

21:37.607 --> 21:38.604
Lack of recruits

21:39.133 --> 21:40.750
problems in your
personnel division.

21:40.786 --> 21:41.735
Keep it in your shop.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.670
After which,
the Mayor steps in

21:43.752 --> 21:45.447
announces we'll have
an academy class

21:45.470 --> 21:47.101
in january come hell
or high water.

21:47.288 --> 21:49.118
Do it like that,
it's a one-day story.

21:49.704 --> 21:52.578
Mr. Mayor, this was
a budget question.

21:53.141 --> 21:55.617
I was directed
to delay that class.

21:55.674 --> 21:56.938
And you took the hit then

21:57.267 --> 21:58.604
and you're taking the hit now.

21:58.827 --> 22:01.114
And I thank you
for both, Commissioner.

22:13.128 --> 22:13.902
89.

22:15.263 --> 22:17.455
And that's just the ones
with Westside addresses.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.131
You gotta narrow
that shit down

22:19.412 --> 22:21.454
find some way to work
with all them Peanuts.

22:21.676 --> 22:24.206
Motherfucker, do I look like
George Washington Carver?

22:28.406 --> 22:31.701
Cocksuckers got me chasing one
gun through a city full of 'em.

22:32.886 --> 22:33.952
Homicide, yeah.

22:34.006 --> 22:35.647
<i>Two down, Pall Mall
and Pimlico. </i>

22:35.672 --> 22:36.845
Pall Mall
and Pimlico.

22:37.911 --> 22:38.322
Got it.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.939
Two down, in the street.

22:45.042 --> 22:45.989
Ray Cole's up.

22:47.891 --> 22:49.087
Cole's in court today.

22:50.213 --> 22:52.535
And I caught that cutting
in Cherry Hill last night.

22:55.268 --> 22:56.265
Don't look at me.

22:56.921 --> 22:59.899
I'm in the haystacks, looking
for Dozerman's prodigal gun.

23:00.474 --> 23:02.797
You gonna make me go
back-to-back as a primary?

23:04.426 --> 23:05.811
That's some
cold shit, Bunk.

23:13.577 --> 23:15.114
Agg assault with
a two-by-four?

23:15.150 --> 23:17.613
I don't think so.
Put that with the part twos.

23:18.847 --> 23:20.970
This one too.
Assault by pointing.

23:21.837 --> 23:22.941
If you don't use a handgun

23:22.952 --> 23:24.946
you don't get credit
for waving it, alright?

23:25.943 --> 23:26.974
Larceny here.

23:27.785 --> 23:29.749
Hump wrote this up
as a daytime b-and-e.

23:30.090 --> 23:31.016
Fuck this.

23:33.820 --> 23:34.464
Do it clean.

23:36.505 --> 23:37.725
Don't massage anything.

23:38.158 --> 23:39.426
Don't sex anything down.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.980
We give 'em the fucking truth.

23:41.272 --> 23:43.384
What about comstat, boss?
They'll rip you.

23:43.678 --> 23:45.496
There's five months
to my 30, right?

23:49.050 --> 23:51.360
Fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke.

23:53.870 --> 23:55.860
The Major no doubt
has some explanation

23:55.884 --> 23:59.565
some excuse if you will,
for a weekly felony

23:59.590 --> 24:01.807
tabulation that's going
in the opposite direction

24:01.818 --> 24:03.249
from the other eight districts.

24:03.366 --> 24:04.311
I have none, Sir.

24:05.662 --> 24:07.093
You are content with this?

24:07.609 --> 24:09.276
No, Deputy, I'm unhappy.

24:10.753 --> 24:12.641
I wish we were making
more of an impact.

24:13.426 --> 24:14.583
But doing what we're doing

24:16.577 --> 24:18.020
it's clear that's not the case.

24:19.170 --> 24:19.966
Major Colvin

24:20.412 --> 24:22.957
I am under the impression crime
is down in the Western.

24:23.953 --> 24:26.712
Perhaps you misfigured
your felony stats this week.

24:26.794 --> 24:27.475
No, Sir.

24:28.202 --> 24:29.457
We were very accurate.

24:30.290 --> 24:31.591
Sometimes the gods are...

24:32.365 --> 24:33.456
uncooperative.

24:34.066 --> 24:34.911
Uncooperative?

24:36.714 --> 24:39.306
This is a cooperative effort,
a cooperative department.

24:40.537 --> 24:41.909
Why in the Eastern District,

24:42.108 --> 24:45.159
Lieutenant Daniels exemplified
this new spirit just the other day.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.766
And because of that

24:46.789 --> 24:48.514
we got two fresh
homicides in the black

24:48.526 --> 24:50.953
and a lot less bodies on
the streets than could have been

24:50.976 --> 24:52.783
had that drug war
been allowed to drag on.

24:52.806 --> 24:55.573
Mayor has me taking the hit in public
for the late academy class.

24:55.582 --> 24:56.415
You're kidding me?

24:56.556 --> 24:57.928
Sacrifice for
the greater good.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.711
Where's the fucking
loyalty, I ask you?

24:59.735 --> 25:02.478
But in the Western, what do
I get from a veteran commander?

25:04.732 --> 25:06.804
You're just having a laugh,
aren't you, Bunny?

25:07.028 --> 25:09.525
You got the real stats
and projections somewhere else.

25:09.830 --> 25:12.176
Someone's just outside
the door with them, right?

25:12.539 --> 25:13.395
A stripper, maybe?

25:14.710 --> 25:15.590
That would be nice.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.983
She comes in,
flashes a little tit

25:18.018 --> 25:19.366
gives us a whiff
of that muff

25:19.389 --> 25:20.972
and delivers
my fucking stat sheets

25:20.996 --> 25:23.812
with a reduction that matches
just what we promised the Mayor.

25:23.963 --> 25:25.089
That would be beautiful.

25:26.377 --> 25:28.453
That would be
creme fucking brulee.

25:30.588 --> 25:32.958
But what I got instead
is some half-assed

25:33.485 --> 25:36.108
"I-wish-we-were-doing-better"
platitude that's

25:36.542 --> 25:37.598
meant to fool maybe

25:37.615 --> 25:40.318
a six-year-old girl into
thinking you're doing your job.

25:40.818 --> 25:42.861
well, she's left the room,
Major Colvin.

25:43.945 --> 25:46.091
She's out there right now
asking the stripper

25:46.116 --> 25:47.991
if she can have her job
when she grows up

25:48.016 --> 25:50.185
because she sure as shit
doesn't want yours.

25:51.100 --> 25:51.768
You know why?

25:54.160 --> 25:56.565
Because there isn't gonna be
a goddamn Western District

25:56.588 --> 25:58.207
in 20 years
if this shit keeps up.

25:58.477 --> 26:01.703
I don't care how many years
you have on this job.

26:01.984 --> 26:03.979
if the felony
rate doesn't fall

26:04.261 --> 26:06.114
you most certainly will.

26:07.557 --> 26:10.840
The gods are fucking you,
you find a way to fuck them back.

26:11.192 --> 26:12.776
It's Baltimore, Gentlemen,

26:13.219 --> 26:15.496
the gods will not save you.

26:36.674 --> 26:37.788
She look like a player?

26:39.746 --> 26:40.427
Bystander?

26:42.409 --> 26:44.333
Right in the middle
of it all if she was.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.079
Yo, my turn to be Omar.

27:06.208 --> 27:06.572
No.

27:08.343 --> 27:09.692
Gimme, please, gimme.

27:14.546 --> 27:16.106
Look, I'm tellin'
you, I was there.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.512
Whitefolks was on the stoop
by the nine-oh-nine club,

27:18.547 --> 27:20.200
an' Apex just
standin' over his ass

27:20.236 --> 27:22.635
pumpin' more holes in the boy
than a motherfucker need.

27:22.652 --> 27:23.589
Shit, I ain't lyin',

27:23.637 --> 27:25.667
Soon as that motherfuckin'
nine stops talkin'

27:25.724 --> 27:27.307
whitefolks looks up
at Apex, says:

27:27.342 --> 27:29.207
"Bitch, that
the best you got"?

27:29.231 --> 27:30.181
Man, I'm jus' sayin'

27:30.215 --> 27:33.184
a boy got that much white blood,
he got to be a punk.

27:35.751 --> 27:36.684
You want me, boss?

27:36.931 --> 27:38.338
Your numbers way down, Fruit.

27:39.628 --> 27:40.424
Way down.

27:41.867 --> 27:43.053
It's Barksdale's people.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.150
They clippin' the dope
fiends comin' up Freemont.

27:48.857 --> 27:50.111
You know, when I ran a shop

27:51.178 --> 27:52.269
an' my numbers dropped

27:53.089 --> 27:54.760
I damn sure did
something 'bout it.

27:56.831 --> 27:58.926
- Yeah, I hear that.
- I just want 'em moved.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.402
Take the younguns with you

28:01.882 --> 28:03.020
give 'em a workout.

28:04.017 --> 28:04.404
Alright.

28:07.322 --> 28:08.459
So, Lieutenant

28:09.151 --> 28:12.012
you got an attaboy
from the deputy today, huh.

28:13.516 --> 28:14.981
Cost me my wire tap though.

28:16.201 --> 28:18.787
Still, it's good work
over in the Eastern.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.229
Knocking down a drug war.

28:22.037 --> 28:24.794
Yeah, he's gonna do the same
thing for me up on Park Heights.

28:24.841 --> 28:27.875
I got this Kintel Williamson
character who needs some fixing

28:28.578 --> 28:30.585
and Rawls promised
me Daniels and his unit

28:30.607 --> 28:31.686
for about a month or so.

28:32.308 --> 28:34.395
You're getting quite
the rep there, kiddo?

28:34.983 --> 28:37.375
So Stan, what's your plan
for the Southeast?

28:37.457 --> 28:39.447
How're you gonna
give Rawls his numbers?

28:39.506 --> 28:42.286
I don't know.
Flex squads on the corners

28:43.072 --> 28:45.230
foot patrols
in the Perkins Homes

28:45.254 --> 28:46.778
overtime out the ass.

28:47.001 --> 28:49.803
And if that don't work,
cheat on the stats.

28:51.210 --> 28:52.159
What say you?

28:52.511 --> 28:53.203
Shit, me?

28:53.239 --> 28:55.420
I'm gonna go to 12-hour
shifts on the weekends.

28:57.391 --> 28:58.763
What about you, Bunny?

29:00.360 --> 29:01.181
I dunno.

29:04.312 --> 29:06.048
I thought I might
legalize drugs.

29:09.755 --> 29:11.477
So they hit
the got-damn alley?

29:11.911 --> 29:13.001
And we on 'em.

29:13.529 --> 29:16.285
That cocksmokin' motherfucker
with the big-bitch gun?

29:16.437 --> 29:18.256
He was runnin' hard
on his ass, but...

29:18.302 --> 29:19.112
I think I hit him.

29:19.487 --> 29:21.071
Nigger, you ain't hit nobody.

29:21.570 --> 29:22.522
I mighta hit him.

29:22.579 --> 29:24.691
Yo, String,
we hit the one girl.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.537
But after that, man, I ain't
see nobody catch no lead, man.

29:28.737 --> 29:29.546
'Cept for Tank.

29:29.605 --> 29:30.773
Yeah, Tank gone.

29:30.949 --> 29:32.180
The other broad dropped him.

29:32.239 --> 29:33.728
So I guess we even now.

29:35.230 --> 29:36.474
So you get one, right?

29:36.990 --> 29:37.377
Yeah.

29:37.917 --> 29:38.503
That's good.

29:39.371 --> 29:40.907
That's like a 40-degree day?

29:41.911 --> 29:44.690
Ain't nobody got nothing
to say about a 40-degree day.

29:45.488 --> 29:48.373
50, bring a smile
to your face.

29:48.713 --> 29:49.147
60?

29:49.159 --> 29:51.915
Shit, niggers is down there
barbecuing on that motherfucker.

29:53.112 --> 29:55.645
Go down to 20, niggers
get their bitch on.

29:55.937 --> 29:58.002
Get their blood complainin'.
But 40?

29:59.222 --> 30:01.463
Nobody give a fuck about 40.

30:01.521 --> 30:03.840
Nobody remember 40
and y'all niggers

30:03.875 --> 30:06.044
is giving me way too
many 40-degree days!?

30:06.057 --> 30:06.808
What the fuck!?

30:14.023 --> 30:16.087
Now, we're gonna cover
that bitch's funeral

30:16.287 --> 30:17.248
her fucking wake.

30:17.319 --> 30:19.171
We're gonna be
all over that motherfucker

30:19.196 --> 30:20.681
till the bitch
hit the ground.

30:20.692 --> 30:22.827
And if the faggot roll up
to pay his respects

30:23.156 --> 30:24.826
we're gonna be
on that motherfucker...

30:24.861 --> 30:26.527
yo, who the fuck you
talking to, man?

30:26.551 --> 30:27.488
It's Donette, String.

30:27.577 --> 30:28.470
She been callin'.

30:28.728 --> 30:29.068
No.

30:30.599 --> 30:31.513
Put the phone down.

30:34.106 --> 30:35.196
Y'all feel me on this?

30:36.076 --> 30:37.144
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:37.788 --> 30:38.456
He show up

30:38.855 --> 30:40.387
we on him
like a motherfucker...

30:40.410 --> 30:41.442
like a 40-degree day.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.035
So, overall
felonies are down

31:22.475 --> 31:23.624
but murders are still up.

31:24.305 --> 31:25.336
What's our next move?

31:25.371 --> 31:26.603
Let me bump overtime

31:27.260 --> 31:29.724
and court pay for homicide
and district ops.

31:30.030 --> 31:32.587
Cases go into the green
before they go into the black.

31:33.806 --> 31:34.229
Done.

31:34.897 --> 31:37.618
And, of course, if we could get
some help at the courthouse

31:37.641 --> 31:38.709
it would go a long way.

31:38.805 --> 31:40.997
If you're going to try
and dig your way out this

31:41.010 --> 31:42.101
don't make me your shovel.

31:42.112 --> 31:44.657
My department is bringing you
casework that goes nowhere.

31:44.681 --> 31:45.819
The cases are thin.

31:46.053 --> 31:47.297
Most wouldn't make it past

31:47.332 --> 31:49.302
a prelim in the court
of a freshman judge.

31:49.338 --> 31:52.003
Well, maybe if your personnel
weren't so got-damned concerned

31:52.015 --> 31:53.640
for their got-damned
conviction rate

31:53.656 --> 31:55.134
they'd chance
a whodunit or two.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.072
Oh, for chrissake!

31:56.108 --> 31:58.570
Jesus, at least pretend
you're on the same side.

32:00.822 --> 32:03.108
Stephen, you and I are both
going to be counting votes

32:03.131 --> 32:04.057
this time next year.

32:04.082 --> 32:05.840
Do something to help
our sorry asses.

32:06.603 --> 32:08.432
And Erv, if you want
to do more than just

32:08.468 --> 32:09.500
finish out walker's term

32:09.512 --> 32:11.634
show me something more
than a pass of the buck.

32:13.285 --> 32:16.312
I don't think any of us
wants to have to get a real job.

32:24.362 --> 32:24.820
Mr. Mayor.

32:25.311 --> 32:25.782
Alright.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.256
I'll see you both
in here on this next week.

32:28.267 --> 32:28.948
Thank you, Sir.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.033
Like children.

32:35.464 --> 32:37.376
Demper's always
been a hack.

32:37.621 --> 32:39.968
But he's an elected hack,
so we're stuck with him.

32:40.682 --> 32:41.926
But burrell, though?

32:43.228 --> 32:45.205
You're vulnerable
on crime, Clarence.

32:45.357 --> 32:47.246
You need to set some
deadwood adrift.

32:47.563 --> 32:49.439
Burrell's got friends.

32:49.779 --> 32:50.623
The ministers?

32:52.126 --> 32:54.248
He might be their man,
but so are you.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.694
You fire Burrell, you get
some new blood in there

32:57.776 --> 32:59.066
the crime rate drops, huh?

32:59.652 --> 33:01.529
The ministers
will live with it.

33:02.783 --> 33:04.754
So you're tough
on deadwood, huh?

33:06.233 --> 33:08.085
In the new 11th
district too, I hear.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.007
Mr. Mayor

33:12.239 --> 33:13.739
it's time for Eunetta to go.

33:13.845 --> 33:14.979
She's had her time

33:15.061 --> 33:17.349
there are better people
out there for the council.

33:17.361 --> 33:19.108
She's on the team, Odell.

33:19.284 --> 33:21.079
just like my police
commissioner.

33:22.509 --> 33:23.564
I value loyalty.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.107
Don't you?

33:26.960 --> 33:28.941
Bunky Bunk.
Where's my Bunk?

33:32.472 --> 33:33.609
Cole's up, not you.

33:35.366 --> 33:37.078
You're on Dozerman's
gun, remember?

33:37.443 --> 33:38.627
Cole's at the courthouse.

33:38.862 --> 33:39.378
Sue me.

33:40.305 --> 33:42.685
Rawls and Foerster
have crawled up into my backside

33:42.732 --> 33:45.242
and they're gonna stay there
until you find Dozerman's gun.

33:45.344 --> 33:47.326
Now, I would like it
very much if I could

33:47.420 --> 33:49.847
unclench my ample asscheeks

33:50.164 --> 33:51.008
if you don't mind

33:51.161 --> 33:52.134
and rid myself

33:52.533 --> 33:53.624
of that discomfort.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.664
Jay, I just caught one
that pushed it's way

33:55.699 --> 33:57.458
all the way to
the top of my stack.

33:58.605 --> 33:59.519
A victim, Jay.

34:00.094 --> 34:01.700
- On the real side.
- Do tell.

34:03.718 --> 34:05.091
Second body in a double.

34:05.901 --> 34:08.456
Girl in her 20s, caught
in the middle of a firefight

34:08.492 --> 34:09.500
takes one in the dome.

34:09.524 --> 34:12.491
But, she's still dead in a zip code
that does not fucking matter

34:12.913 --> 34:15.306
and you still owe me
a departmental-issue nine.

34:17.366 --> 34:18.739
Find the fucking gun, Bunk.

34:28.481 --> 34:29.326
Fuck me.

34:29.924 --> 34:31.813
Kintel Williamson,
who the fuck?

34:31.849 --> 34:33.338
He has corners
in Park Heights.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.440
But Jesus, who doesn't?

34:34.487 --> 34:36.106
So all day we're
calling you, Jimmy

34:36.130 --> 34:37.556
wonderin' where you were at.

34:38.635 --> 34:40.664
Kima, maybe you
can enlighten us.

34:40.745 --> 34:41.531
Don't look at me.

34:42.176 --> 34:45.167
My runnin' buddy don't even tell
me where he's off to these days.

34:45.906 --> 34:47.114
I was at the library.

34:47.444 --> 34:47.947
Bullshit.

34:47.973 --> 34:49.731
The library at M.C.I. Jessup.

34:53.074 --> 34:54.927
D'angelo barksdale
was not a suicide.

34:55.864 --> 34:56.956
The M.E. tell you that?

34:57.050 --> 34:57.871
He didn't need to.

34:57.893 --> 34:59.673
The physical evidence
didn't match up.

34:59.697 --> 35:01.773
Look, I don't like
coming up off Stringer

35:01.797 --> 35:03.380
and Prop Joe
anymore than you do

35:04.107 --> 35:05.983
but McNulty,
this shit is kinda weak.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.801
Cedric is under
a lot of pressure

35:07.848 --> 35:09.912
to use this unit to get
the murder rate down.

35:09.923 --> 35:10.485
So, for now

35:11.013 --> 35:13.090
Stringer Bell's jacket
belongs in narcotics.

35:13.207 --> 35:14.919
Man took you
off a boat, Jimmy.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.215
He want to peel his unit off,
his unit, Jimmy.

35:18.685 --> 35:22.028
And go after the target of his
choice, maybe it's his call.

35:22.919 --> 35:26.720
Lester, I thought you were
all about the best case possible.

35:27.448 --> 35:28.890
When it's there, I am.

36:25.664 --> 36:27.352
Yo, I need y'all
to hear this, man.

36:31.986 --> 36:33.228
It was my fault.

36:34.986 --> 36:35.572
Ya hear me?

36:37.179 --> 36:37.977
I'm sorry, yo.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.478
That don't do nothin' for me.

37:06.192 --> 37:06.825
How come...

37:08.490 --> 37:10.801
they know you're police
when they hook up with you.

37:12.068 --> 37:14.261
And they know you're
police when they move in.

37:15.727 --> 37:16.886
And they know you're police

37:16.909 --> 37:18.984
when they decide
to start a family with you.

37:20.357 --> 37:21.894
And all that shit is just fine

37:22.597 --> 37:23.770
until one day it ain't.

37:24.967 --> 37:25.807
One day, it's:

37:26.722 --> 37:28.399
"you should have
a regular job. "

37:29.526 --> 37:31.343
"You need to be
home at 5:00".

37:32.176 --> 37:33.418
"You need to call more. "

37:34.451 --> 37:35.022
I'm sayin'.

37:35.773 --> 37:37.555
"You need to stop
fucking waitresses. "

37:43.185 --> 37:45.148
I wanna come down
here tomorrow to Western.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.482
See what's what since
those towers came down.

37:49.254 --> 37:51.283
We're supposed to start
on Kintel tomorrow.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.584
Oh, fuck that chump.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.215
He can wait day or two.

37:54.707 --> 37:55.634
Yeah, okay.

37:56.283 --> 37:57.057
What the fuck.

38:04.129 --> 38:06.169
When you were humpin'
a radio car in the Western?

38:06.234 --> 38:07.113
Was this your hole?

38:08.097 --> 38:08.428
Yeah.

38:09.706 --> 38:11.800
Here and down on Winchester.
Under the bridge.

38:12.128 --> 38:13.899
Bet there were a lot
of nights you didn't

38:13.923 --> 38:15.166
go home to the missus.

38:18.414 --> 38:20.502
Don't tell me
I'm the same kinda asshole.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.707
Pucker up, girlfriend.

38:23.654 --> 38:24.205
Jesus.

38:25.131 --> 38:26.668
I'm turning into McNulty.

39:06.599 --> 39:08.323
Hey, I'm going out.

39:10.187 --> 39:11.642
Nah, grandma,
you know I can't.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.504
Times like these,
honey, you have to shine.

39:15.029 --> 39:16.953
In your face, in your clothes

39:17.716 --> 39:19.487
and in your pocket.
Now, go on.

39:20.999 --> 39:22.911
Make sure you get
something to eat, hear?

39:23.052 --> 39:23.920
Go on, now.

39:33.950 --> 39:34.876
You know 'em?

39:35.217 --> 39:35.979
sNot a clue.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.746
Crew on that corner
looks familiar.

39:46.871 --> 39:48.103
A couple old faces.

39:50.225 --> 39:50.941
Not many.

39:52.700 --> 39:55.280
You go away for a year
and the whole world changes up.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.416
Quiet though.

39:58.779 --> 40:00.467
Barksdale loses the towers

40:00.492 --> 40:02.931
and he's able to stretch out
without bodies falling?

40:04.372 --> 40:06.941
I wonder what the Western
guys have been seeing lately.

40:13.048 --> 40:13.730
Hey, Jay.

40:20.971 --> 40:22.061
What the fuck happened?

40:23.223 --> 40:23.610
When?

40:25.581 --> 40:26.133
How is he?

40:30.154 --> 40:30.857
Aw, shit.

40:35.948 --> 40:37.167
You'll let me know, right?

40:39.840 --> 40:40.566
Okay, yeah.

40:41.821 --> 40:42.221
Thanks.

40:45.984 --> 40:46.876
You know Ray Cole?

40:47.604 --> 40:48.414
Homicide, right?

40:50.551 --> 40:53.038
Collapsed in the gym at the
central district this morning.

40:54.551 --> 40:56.122
On a fucking
stairmaster.

40:57.108 --> 40:57.951
Well, how is he?

40:58.878 --> 40:59.794
A stairmaster.

41:08.382 --> 41:09.836
Hey, Puddin', check it out.

41:10.505 --> 41:11.067
Where they at?

41:11.349 --> 41:12.080
I don't know.

41:14.778 --> 41:15.540
Look out, man.

41:25.635 --> 41:26.748
Break it, motherfuckers.

41:28.604 --> 41:29.695
Man said break, come on.

41:29.706 --> 41:30.950
I was workin' on that bitch.

41:32.391 --> 41:33.307
Yeah, Shorty, you hard.

41:34.796 --> 41:35.969
We outta here.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.190
The Commissioner
acknowledged that money

41:49.203 --> 41:51.033
had been budgeted
for the academy class

41:51.467 --> 41:53.530
but said the department
was awaiting approval

41:53.542 --> 41:55.407
of a federal training
and education grant

41:55.442 --> 41:57.308
before scheduling the program.

41:57.635 --> 41:59.468
Burrell can talk
some shit, can't he?

42:02.012 --> 42:03.244
Downtown in the house.

42:03.514 --> 42:04.605
Hey, Kima, baby.

42:04.864 --> 42:05.614
Hey, Ellis.

42:07.760 --> 42:08.193
Herc.

42:10.047 --> 42:11.583
So, what do we
owe the pleasure?

42:11.618 --> 42:14.562
Cruisin' your district, seeing
what's up since the towers fell.

42:14.610 --> 42:16.462
We see Barksdale crews
on a few corners

42:16.486 --> 42:18.338
but no one seems
to be beefin' with 'em.

42:18.373 --> 42:20.107
What's up with
all this brotherhood?

42:20.117 --> 42:21.408
We keep the lid on tight.

42:21.431 --> 42:23.402
You know, they know
we are not their friends

42:23.413 --> 42:25.396
and they damn well know
we'll take it to 'em

42:25.418 --> 42:26.368
if they don't behave.

42:27.660 --> 42:28.832
What do your C.I.'s tell you?

42:29.874 --> 42:30.577
Fuck C.I.'s.

42:30.602 --> 42:32.008
We don't need
no stinkin' C.I.'s.

42:32.103 --> 42:34.343
We tune 'em up, we beat 'em
down, we lock 'em up.

42:34.648 --> 42:36.442
It's the Western District way.

42:38.682 --> 42:39.243
Sergeant

42:39.395 --> 42:41.894
you're wanted in roll call
for a supervisor's meeting.

42:44.416 --> 42:45.247
Gotta go.

42:49.655 --> 42:50.934
Remember, what I told you?

42:51.438 --> 42:53.585
A police is only
as good as his informants?

42:53.784 --> 42:55.578
Well, we ain't downtown
no more, Kima.

42:55.589 --> 42:56.809
We're in the trenches here.

42:56.892 --> 42:59.061
You want information,
you go get your own C.I.

42:59.085 --> 42:59.952
And shoot the shit.

43:07.665 --> 43:08.685
You're late, Sergeant.

43:08.897 --> 43:11.054
I had a couple downtown
detectives in my shop.

43:11.067 --> 43:13.352
They were confused
and required assistance, Sir.

43:17.962 --> 43:19.135
Well, I'll catch you up.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.132
The new strategic plan
for the district

43:23.556 --> 43:25.385
is to move all
street-level trafficking

43:25.725 --> 43:26.769
to these three areas.

43:27.566 --> 43:28.599
We want to push it.

43:29.197 --> 43:30.076
Push it, boss?

43:30.310 --> 43:32.293
If they don't go easy,
then they go hard.

43:32.650 --> 43:33.025
But...

43:34.223 --> 43:35.676
we let these knuckleheads know

43:36.345 --> 43:38.222
that if they
move to these areas...

43:38.433 --> 43:40.028
away from
the residential streets

43:40.157 --> 43:42.433
away from commercial areas,
away from schools...

43:42.902 --> 43:44.647
if they take their
shit down the road

43:45.584 --> 43:48.575
they go about their business
without any interference from us.

43:49.326 --> 43:51.566
It's going to be hands-off
in the Western District

43:51.578 --> 43:52.739
for the foreseeable future.

43:52.763 --> 43:55.523
Bullshit, man,
no fuckin' way.

43:55.534 --> 43:56.074
Wait, wait.

43:56.098 --> 43:58.431
You're saying you want us
to give them a free pass?

43:58.467 --> 44:00.203
How we going to look
them in the eye?

44:00.237 --> 44:01.306
They'll shit all over us.

44:01.329 --> 44:02.983
Tell their kids
to shit all over us.

44:03.018 --> 44:04.449
Hey, the Major
wasn't finished.

44:06.845 --> 44:08.417
You gotta take
the long view here.

44:10.001 --> 44:10.551
Once

44:11.959 --> 44:13.214
once they're all comfortable

44:13.589 --> 44:15.267
once they're all rounded up

44:16.476 --> 44:18.024
once they've been
down there a bit

44:18.036 --> 44:19.913
and they're used to
putting their feet up

44:19.936 --> 44:21.074
and playing wit the remote

44:22.363 --> 44:23.747
then we move.

44:24.615 --> 44:27.113
Then we go back
and we do police work.

44:28.119 --> 44:29.480
Look at it this way, Gentlemen

44:30.301 --> 44:32.365
would you rather
shoot a fish in the ocean?

44:32.870 --> 44:35.062
Or would you rather
gather 'em up

44:35.796 --> 44:37.157
in a few small barrels

44:38.060 --> 44:39.679
and start emptying
your clips then?

44:39.725 --> 44:42.798
Not to mention, you still get to kick
the shit out of all the mopes

44:42.821 --> 44:44.205
who don't move off our corners.

44:45.765 --> 44:46.750
So, it ain't all bad.

44:54.362 --> 44:55.102
Slow up, girl.

44:56.381 --> 44:56.980
Come on now.

45:02.888 --> 45:03.804
So, this your ride?

45:05.433 --> 45:06.196
It's nice.

45:06.618 --> 45:07.932
Suppose you got a Lex.

45:08.153 --> 45:08.952
Nah, girl.

45:09.585 --> 45:10.589
Got a bus pass.

45:11.680 --> 45:12.654
You out the game, then.

45:13.897 --> 45:15.738
Doing a little
landscaping right now.

45:16.654 --> 45:17.990
But tryin' to figure
things out.

45:21.687 --> 45:24.207
So, what's your boy's name?

45:24.653 --> 45:25.228
Allen.

45:25.627 --> 45:26.249
After Iverson?

45:26.811 --> 45:27.714
After his daddy.

45:33.057 --> 45:33.456
What?

45:33.913 --> 45:36.658
Trying to picture
you mowing a land.

45:39.284 --> 45:40.598
I don't be wearin' the suit.

45:41.768 --> 45:43.047
You look good in it still.

45:43.421 --> 45:44.418
You look good too.

45:44.478 --> 45:45.767
You know they bought

45:45.990 --> 45:47.996
a lot a folks out
with early retirement

45:48.031 --> 45:48.794
in parks and rec.

45:49.592 --> 45:51.879
I could maybe hook you up
with someone to talk to.

45:52.536 --> 45:54.287
A man at my church
is helping the city

45:54.300 --> 45:55.426
fill a lot of those jobs.

45:56.668 --> 45:57.396
That would be...

45:58.064 --> 45:58.697
thank you.

46:02.263 --> 46:03.307
Write your
number there.

46:04.793 --> 46:05.521
He'll call you.

46:11.431 --> 46:12.182
I gotta go.

46:13.073 --> 46:14.140
It was good seeing you.

46:16.751 --> 46:17.255
Grace.

46:19.554 --> 46:20.533
Looking at you.

46:21.759 --> 46:22.269
What?

46:23.378 --> 46:23.922
Hurts.

46:25.180 --> 46:26.353
Shouldn't look then.

46:38.351 --> 46:40.392
Food blast'll
take yer mind off it.

46:40.696 --> 46:42.138
Rather my mind on it, Bubs?

46:44.157 --> 46:45.787
Swear I'm sick
of all this, man.

46:46.844 --> 46:48.251
Wonderin' when
I got so old.

46:48.532 --> 46:50.491
How 'bout some more
mac n' cheese, huh?

46:50.561 --> 46:51.230
Hey, Bubs.

46:52.344 --> 46:52.930
Kima.

46:53.048 --> 46:53.576
Hey, Bub.

46:54.643 --> 46:56.121
McNutty, man, my mainest man.

46:57.035 --> 46:58.465
You ready to put
some work in?

46:58.490 --> 46:59.052
Born ready.

46:59.616 --> 47:01.105
Snitchin'?
Fuck that, Bubs.

47:01.222 --> 47:02.348
Hey, hey, nah, man.

47:02.583 --> 47:04.530
Better than liftin'
500 pound radiators.

47:04.857 --> 47:06.335
I'm up for these two, Johnny.

47:06.805 --> 47:07.881
It's easy money, man.

47:08.045 --> 47:08.479
C'mon

47:09.171 --> 47:10.074
let's grab a burger.

47:12.819 --> 47:14.450
Mind if I bang
outta here early?

47:14.836 --> 47:16.491
I ain't right
with this Cole thing.

47:17.170 --> 47:19.423
Gonna be a detectives'
wake at Kavanagh's tonight.

47:19.459 --> 47:20.209
You gonna come?

47:20.362 --> 47:21.334
Barely knew the guy.

47:22.333 --> 47:24.150
You all layin' him
out at the bar, huh?

47:24.443 --> 47:25.123
Tradition.

47:25.241 --> 47:27.516
Tomorrow night, he goes
the funeral home for family.

47:27.539 --> 47:29.492
Tonight, Ray drinks
with the boys.

47:30.969 --> 47:32.775
C'mon, Bubs,
we ain't got all day.

47:37.290 --> 47:39.886
And he's up for re-election
and he's never had a single one

47:39.911 --> 47:41.775
of his goo-goo bills
pass the committee.

47:41.798 --> 47:44.214
So, he's got one for
all-day kindergarten

47:44.238 --> 47:46.349
I mean who's gonna argue
with more kindergarten?

47:46.361 --> 47:48.156
I mean, this guy
has got a bill which is

47:48.179 --> 47:50.816
the legislative equivalent
of kissing a baby.

47:51.402 --> 47:52.926
So, right, he goes
to his chairman

47:52.938 --> 47:53.993
pleads his case and says:

47:54.017 --> 47:56.046
"You know, this don't
go through, I'm torched. "

47:56.070 --> 47:58.626
"I'm going to be back
in that hardware store, mixing paint. "

47:58.649 --> 48:00.289
So, the chairman
takes pity and agrees

48:00.324 --> 48:02.659
gets the bill to the floor.
But the house speaker?

48:02.681 --> 48:03.690
He hates this bill.

48:03.703 --> 48:05.568
So, it gets loved
to death, you know...

48:05.603 --> 48:08.300
slap on an amendment
for another 150 mil in costs

48:08.335 --> 48:11.276
subsidies, handouts and
the bill goes down in flames.

48:11.299 --> 48:12.566
122 to 10.

48:12.590 --> 48:14.794
The delegate, he can
smell those paint cans.

48:14.818 --> 48:15.767
And the chairman says:

48:15.792 --> 48:19.434
"Hey, sorry brother,
I fought like a tiger for that bill. "

48:21.007 --> 48:22.368
Who wants friends like that?

48:22.402 --> 48:24.713
You want friends
in this racket, get a dog.

48:26.182 --> 48:26.547
What?

48:28.399 --> 48:29.689
I need to talk to him.

48:31.285 --> 48:32.975
Look, just tell
him it's Donette.

48:34.182 --> 48:35.907
Yeah, he know
who the fuck I am.

48:36.504 --> 48:38.078
- YoSstring, she say...
- Not now.

48:39.813 --> 48:41.549
Look, he say not now,
I gotta go.

48:48.402 --> 48:48.823
Marlo.

48:49.245 --> 48:50.396
It's a problem, String.

48:54.055 --> 48:55.263
Club soda and lime.

48:56.329 --> 48:57.972
You'll never
get there that way.

48:59.551 --> 49:00.068
Get where?

49:04.923 --> 49:05.474
Excuse me.

49:09.990 --> 49:11.104
How the hell was I to know

49:11.116 --> 49:13.121
the Mayor was gonna
put the screws to you?

49:13.602 --> 49:14.564
You read the paper?

49:15.479 --> 49:16.721
I look like shit.

49:17.062 --> 49:19.056
Hey, you got your class

49:19.818 --> 49:20.991
and probably scored points

49:21.014 --> 49:23.489
with Royce out
of sheer loyalty, right?

49:53.980 --> 49:56.572
We are police

49:59.081 --> 50:00.676
so no lies between us.

50:02.682 --> 50:03.991
He wasn't
the greatest detective

50:05.387 --> 50:06.479
and he wasn't the worst.

50:07.522 --> 50:10.336
He put down some good cases
and he dogged a few bad ones.

50:12.037 --> 50:13.771
But, the motherfucker
had his moments.

50:13.796 --> 50:14.897
Yes, he fucking did.

50:16.541 --> 50:20.107
You remember
the Mississippi extradition

50:20.137 --> 50:21.075
the Arson murders?

50:21.602 --> 50:22.846
He brought that case home.

50:23.139 --> 50:23.960
And the triple

50:24.347 --> 50:26.341
at the after-hours
over on Hudson Street?

50:26.541 --> 50:28.567
That was Ray Cole at his best.

50:29.669 --> 50:31.523
And Fayette Street...

50:31.921 --> 50:33.610
in '93, the drug wars.

50:34.290 --> 50:36.390
He took a lot of hot
corners and cooled 'em.

50:38.466 --> 50:39.311
Yes, indeed.

50:43.838 --> 50:45.609
He won as much as he lost

50:46.347 --> 50:47.509
much as any of us.

50:54.011 --> 50:57.529
For chrissakes, Hugh, play
the fucking song already.

50:59.367 --> 51:01.372
Did he piss off
a wife or three?

51:02.733 --> 51:04.047
No fucking doubt.

51:05.406 --> 51:07.365
I think the last one
actually kinda got used

51:07.400 --> 51:08.456
to him, thank God.

51:09.781 --> 51:11.633
Did he say the wrong
shit now and then?

51:12.196 --> 51:14.296
Did he bust balls
and cheat on his taxes

51:15.000 --> 51:17.345
and forget to call his mother
and fuck the wrong broad

51:17.369 --> 51:19.551
for the wrong fucking
reason every now and then?

51:19.562 --> 51:21.076
Who fucking doesn't, Christ?

51:21.966 --> 51:25.272
Was he as full of shit
as every other sadsack

51:25.308 --> 51:28.511
motherfucker wearing
a badge of Baltimore City Police?

51:29.026 --> 51:30.328
Abso-fucking-lutely.

51:31.184 --> 51:33.481
His shit was as weak
as ours, no question.

51:34.643 --> 51:35.992
But Ray Cole stood with us,

51:38.618 --> 51:39.334
all of us

51:40.871 --> 51:41.810
in Baltimore

51:42.802 --> 51:43.389
working

51:44.351 --> 51:47.142
sharing a dark corner
of the american experiment.

51:53.466 --> 51:54.181
He was called.

51:57.723 --> 51:58.545
He served.

52:00.152 --> 52:00.913
He is counted.

52:02.380 --> 52:03.130
Old king Cole.

52:03.423 --> 52:04.992
Old king Cole!

53:25.800 --> 53:28.485
I'm sorry, but I gotta
get these guys home.

53:29.694 --> 53:32.611
But all things considered,
I think they did pretty well.

53:32.741 --> 53:33.480
They were great.

53:34.348 --> 53:35.978
And you were great,
really, Jen.

53:37.069 --> 53:39.731
Besides, I think they got
all the family shots they need.

53:40.059 --> 53:41.748
So, you'll be awhile,
though, huh?

53:42.715 --> 53:44.006
Gotta work the crowd,
you know?

53:44.967 --> 53:46.879
Make 'em think
I'm worthy of their faith.

53:46.927 --> 53:47.618
You are.

53:47.752 --> 53:49.442
- Well, thank you...
- Most of the time.

53:49.461 --> 53:49.752
Bitch.

53:53.535 --> 53:55.154
Not too late if you
can help it, okay?

54:24.752 --> 54:26.417
Shit is fucked.

54:29.948 --> 54:33.149
You fucking wake up,
like any other day.

54:35.774 --> 54:36.665
You fucking eat

54:38.072 --> 54:40.887
and think about bills
and dry cleaning and shit

54:42.623 --> 54:43.533
and fucking vacation

54:43.604 --> 54:46.877
and your fucking
retirement plan and what?

54:49.539 --> 54:50.209
Like that.

54:52.660 --> 54:53.134
Like that.

54:55.703 --> 54:56.957
He checked out of here

54:58.365 --> 55:01.239
with you still owing him
a clearance on that Omar thing.

55:01.274 --> 55:02.293
Oh, I know, I know.

55:02.739 --> 55:03.466
I fucking know.

55:04.905 --> 55:05.539
Like that.

55:13.233 --> 55:14.847
On a fucking stairmaster.

55:18.202 --> 55:20.407
On a fucking stairmaster.

55:26.006 --> 55:27.672
Wake up an' die
right, you cunts.

56:50.805 --> 56:51.824
What's goin' on, man?

56:55.736 --> 56:56.830
That whip is pretty, yo.

56:56.864 --> 56:58.933
I gotta get me one
of them joints someday.

56:59.670 --> 57:00.548
Shit. Yeah.
