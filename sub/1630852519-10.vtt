WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:04.352
- An intense man, wasn't he?

00:04.395 --> 00:05.962
Your Cardiologist?
- Yeah.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.790
- Sad to hear about
his lung cancer.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.967
- The death of a baby,
it takes a toll on any doctor.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.577
- Dad's dying, Junie!

00:12.621 --> 00:14.971
- The guy's oncologist changed
his prognosis

00:15.015 --> 00:16.451
from four months to ten days.

00:16.494 --> 00:19.019
- I need you, so I'm asking.
Claire, stay.

00:19.062 --> 00:22.239
- This is the sort of things
you want us to be able
to handle, right?

00:22.283 --> 00:25.460
- Not you, not with this lawsuit
hanging over you.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.462
[in Arabic]:

00:29.681 --> 00:32.380
- Sorry, Dr Mitchell, I don't
think you can help me.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.519
[car honking]

00:44.131 --> 00:46.220
[gentle music]

00:49.484 --> 00:51.312
- They're offering us a deal?

00:51.355 --> 00:54.054
- If there's a settlement
on the table, then we should
take it.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.056
- Except that Grisholm
wants all costs,

00:56.099 --> 00:57.492
and an admission of
responsibility

00:57.535 --> 00:58.841
for what happened
to his daughter.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.496
- Uh, I thought we agreed
we did nothing wrong.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.194
- But we have to be smart.
Limit our exposure.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.066
- Taking into account
Dr Bishop's stroke

01:06.109 --> 01:08.938
and Dr Hamed's unorthodox
beginnings with our hospital,

01:08.981 --> 01:10.548
I have to say I agree.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.595
- And this could all
just go away if we settle?

01:13.638 --> 01:15.901
- If you take the deal.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.903
And we stay out of court.

01:17.947 --> 01:21.037
- Again?
Second dropped call today.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.474
- Rolling black outs
from the heat.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.782
I know admitting error leaves
a bad taste, Jed,

01:26.825 --> 01:30.481
but it may be our least
objectionable choice.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.185
- We need to think
very carefully

01:38.228 --> 01:40.361
before rushing into
a decision.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.929
- Hello, sir.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.758
- Hey!
So what did the X-ray say?

01:46.802 --> 01:48.586
- Well, nothing.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.286
Your lungs are clear,
there's no sign of emphysema
or pneumonia.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.114
- That's good, right?

01:54.157 --> 01:55.506
- It is, we just don't
know why

01:55.550 --> 01:58.422
your blood oxygen levels
are still low, so...

01:58.466 --> 02:00.555
- Thing is,
I've got movers coming

02:00.598 --> 02:03.166
and my ex-girlfriend,
she's uh...

02:03.210 --> 02:07.910
she's threatened to set
my stuff on fire if I don't
take it today.

02:09.258 --> 02:12.262
You think you could, uh,
prescribe something for me

02:12.306 --> 02:14.134
to help me through the move?

02:14.177 --> 02:16.919
- Are you anxious? Because that
can cause shortness of breath.

02:16.962 --> 02:21.141
- I've got lorazepam,
but I know you're not supposed
to take those every day.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.273
- So you're wondering about
antidepressants.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.146
Have you talked to your GP?
- I don't have one.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.060
But the drummer in my band,

02:28.104 --> 02:31.325
he swears by this SSRI
he's on, you know.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.241
I play double-bass.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.505
- I'll look into it.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.247
- Thanks!

02:42.379 --> 02:43.859
- Hey!
I thought you were done.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.601
- Yeah, I am. Can you get
Mr Jennings a psych consult?

02:46.644 --> 02:50.170
And also he needs bloods,
ABG-BNP and hematocrit,
just to be safe.

02:50.213 --> 02:53.085
- Uh, sorry, Mags,
but before you go...

02:53.129 --> 02:54.826
the coroner's office
called again.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.480
They're still waiting for
Oliver Campbell's chart notes.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.960
- Yeah.
I haven't transcribed them yet.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.614
- Do you need help?
I'm basically a chart whisperer

02:59.657 --> 03:01.355
when it comes to other people's
messy handwriting--

03:01.398 --> 03:03.487
- Can you both please back off,
seriously?

03:03.531 --> 03:06.229
I will be back tonight, and
I will do it then.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.579
- Okay.
- Urgency.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.713
Mags! Mags, hold on,
incoming trauma.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.845
- Page if they need me.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.456
[sirens in the distance]

03:15.499 --> 03:17.980
- Level P-three, spot 42.

03:19.721 --> 03:23.246
- Their flight lands in 30,
so, I'll be right back.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.379
- Couldn't they just take a cab?

03:25.422 --> 03:27.381
- I haven't seen my husband
or son in a month, June.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.122
I'd like to pick them up.
- I'm surprised you're even...

03:30.166 --> 03:31.515
letting Cle be here for this.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.952
- He wants to say bye
to his grandad

03:33.996 --> 03:37.521
and that's how he feels, I don't
want to shield him from it.

03:37.565 --> 03:40.394
Besides, I didn't even think
they were gonna make it in time

03:40.437 --> 03:41.873
and then Dad asked for
the ventilator.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.659
- So that's what he's holding on
for? An audience?

03:44.702 --> 03:46.878
- I gave the nurse
your phone number.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.359
Relax, it's just
for emergencies.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.710
Thank you for the car.
- Yeah.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.410
[alarm]

04:00.936 --> 04:04.026
- Mags. Why weren't you in
the boardroom earlier?

04:04.069 --> 04:05.636
The meeting with the lawyers?

04:05.680 --> 04:09.205
- I figured they'd told you.
They dropped me from the suit.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.946
- Yousef Ahmad.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.949
22-year-old pedestrian
impaled by a BBQ skewer.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.472
- Whoa. Okay.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.822
- GCS 15.
BP's 110 over 80.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.911
- Can you describe
how you're feeling, sir?

04:19.954 --> 04:23.959
- I think okay. The paramedics
loaded me up with morphine so...

04:24.002 --> 04:26.918
- Yeah, I'd hope so.
Get him a blanket and start
warmed saline.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.703
How did this happen?

04:28.746 --> 04:31.662
- All four lights went out
at this intersection
at the same time.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.925
One of those junk collection
trucks slammed on its brakes

04:33.969 --> 04:35.275
and lost some cargo.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.841
I felt something hit me,

04:36.885 --> 04:39.104
but it wasn't until I looked
down that I realized that...

04:39.148 --> 04:41.106
- Okay, we need to keep you
still while we assess.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.239
- Are you gonna be able
to get this thing out of me?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.155
- We will, but first,
we need to see what kind
of damage it has done.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.896
Claire, page an attending?
- Yeah.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.551
- I see fluid. Chest and abdo.
Possible organ injury.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.422
- I don't feel alright.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.032
[machine beeping]
- Yousef?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.469
Can you open your eyes?
Yousef?

04:55.512 --> 04:58.254
- Temp's up, and he's clammy.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.864
- Mean arterial pressure
is stable.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.779
If it has perforated his bowel,
he could be in sepsis.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.694
- No, it's too soon for that.
Possible pneumothorax.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.609
Claire, prep a chest tube.
- No, O-two sats are fine.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.307
We need to get him
to an X-ray first,

05:07.350 --> 05:08.960
get him antibiotics and
a tetanus shot.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.267
- Chest tube or imaging,
which call are we making?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.877
- Neither.
At least, not down here.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.792
Singh heard this was coming
and cleared the way

05:14.836 --> 05:17.142
so we can image upstairs,
walk him straight into OR

05:17.186 --> 05:18.666
and handle anything else
that comes up.

05:18.709 --> 05:22.017
- Alright. I guess we do
nothing.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.761
[gentle music]

05:40.383 --> 05:41.819
- Mr Sullivan?

05:41.863 --> 05:45.997
- Sully. Sorry, man.
I was going stir crazy.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.608
Small spaces aren't my thing.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.479
- I see that you have dislocated
your knee cap?

05:49.523 --> 05:52.308
- Yeah. Yesterday.
But it popped right back in,

05:52.352 --> 05:53.744
I've been able
to put weight on it,

05:53.788 --> 05:55.529
but your triage guy insisted
I take the chair.

05:55.572 --> 05:58.183
- How did it happen?
- I'm a rock climber.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.795
Free solo, mostly.
No ropes.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.014
- That sounds like
an intense hobby.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.365
- Yeah. Religion for me, man.

06:05.408 --> 06:09.412
I was at Capreol near Sudbury,
and I fell.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.196
I don't know what happened.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.198
I've done that route
a hundred times.

06:13.242 --> 06:16.201
Anyway, I thought I was dead
until a ridge came out

06:16.245 --> 06:17.768
of nowhere and broke my fall.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.815
- Sounds like
you're a lucky man.

06:20.858 --> 06:24.427
- Yeah. I stitched the worst
of it myself.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.473
- And your head?

06:26.516 --> 06:29.084
- Smacked it, just not hard
enough for a concussion.

06:29.127 --> 06:33.175
But once I got back
into the city, my foot started
feeling weird.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.090
- You feel that?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.834
- Hey, listen, the tingling,

06:39.877 --> 06:41.488
that's not gonna be
permanent will it?

06:41.531 --> 06:44.229
- We'll do imaging to rule out
any blood flow complications,

06:44.273 --> 06:46.884
but I do feel a pulse in
your foot which is a good sign.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.585
You do have a bit of a fever.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.064
Do you feel fluish, ill?

06:53.108 --> 06:55.458
- Yeah, but I sweat those out
pretty quickly.

06:55.502 --> 06:58.505
- I'll be back once
you've been to radiology, okay?

07:01.159 --> 07:03.510
[music playing in earphones]

07:03.553 --> 07:05.990
[phone vibrating]

07:08.950 --> 07:10.299
- Perry!

07:10.342 --> 07:12.170
I've been trying to get you
for days.

07:12.214 --> 07:15.260
- I know, bud. My crew's stuck
on this other job.

07:15.304 --> 07:19.047
- Okay, well, it's just that
you finally got my water hook
back up in the house,

07:19.090 --> 07:21.963
only to demo my kitchen
and rip out half my wiring.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.314
Look, I have no AC.
I can't wash my clothes,

07:25.357 --> 07:27.272
I'm using a cooler
for my food.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.449
- Like I said,
we'll be back soon,

07:29.492 --> 07:31.276
hopefully sometime
this month.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.453
Look, I gotta go.
- No, Perry!

07:33.496 --> 07:35.150
Perry!

07:36.064 --> 07:37.631
[sighing]

07:40.111 --> 07:41.243
[sighs]

07:46.640 --> 07:49.251
Excuse me, ma'am?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.558
Is he doing okay?

07:51.993 --> 07:54.038
Your son.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.649
Is he alright?

07:56.954 --> 07:58.434
You're deaf.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.438
Okay, well, I'm a doctor,
and he doesn't look very well.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.179
May I?

08:08.270 --> 08:10.533
It's just, he's very flushed.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.014
Hey! I'm Theo.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.627
Can you tell me
how you feel?

08:19.194 --> 08:20.804
He's deaf too?

08:20.848 --> 08:23.590
Okay. We need to get
him some--

08:23.633 --> 08:24.808
We need to get him some water.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.418
We gotta get his temperature
down.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.509
My work is just a couple blocks
that way. We can take him.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.075
Hold on.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.340
He's really burning up and
with the heat today...

08:35.384 --> 08:37.604
Okay? Okay.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.535
[doorbell rings]

09:01.715 --> 09:03.368
[knocking]

09:03.412 --> 09:05.588
- I hear you, I'm coming.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.677
Hold on a goddamn minute
already.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.550
- Dr Mann?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.552
- Who the hell are you?

09:12.595 --> 09:16.643
- I'm Magalie, Magalie Leblanc.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.689
- Is that name supposed to mean
something to me?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.039
- Yes, I was...

09:22.083 --> 09:25.216
Well, you were my cardiac
surgeon when I was a kid.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.740
Around 2004.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.829
- Look, if you get some kind
of problem,

09:28.872 --> 09:31.179
I don't practice anymore.
- No, I know.

09:33.616 --> 09:37.402
I just heard
about your lung cancer

09:37.446 --> 09:39.840
and I wanted
to come and see you.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.190
- For what?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.629
- To thank you, I guess?

09:47.412 --> 09:50.111
Yeah, I'm a doctor now too.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.027
- My condolences.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.377
What did you say your name was?

09:55.420 --> 09:56.944
- Magalie Leblanc.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.643
I had like a rare
kind of congenital heart block?

10:00.687 --> 10:03.603
- Doesn't ring a bell.
If there's nothing else.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.824
[gentle music]

10:17.617 --> 10:19.357
[exhales]

10:20.228 --> 10:22.317
- I hear you're officially
a nurse practitioner now.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.058
Any exciting interventions yet?

10:24.101 --> 10:26.756
- Claire, triage
is asking if we ordered
more gloves this time.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.671
- And Mr Vessi needs
his dressings changed,

10:28.715 --> 10:30.368
but he won't let anyone
near him but you.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.284
- Hm. Well, you know.
At least the scrubs are new.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.635
Mr Sullivan's X-ray,

10:35.678 --> 10:38.333
CT keeps having to reboot,
so nothing there.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.337
[indistinct chatter]

10:43.599 --> 10:45.514
- Curtain 6, your patient?
- No.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.950
Dr Leblanc ordered
the psych consult.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.822
But sir,
about our last session...

10:48.865 --> 10:50.867
- You're certainly not the first
patient to break up

10:50.911 --> 10:52.608
with their psychiatrist,
Dr Hamed.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.262
But my door is always open.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.441
- I'm sorry, Dr Mitchell.
- Go.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.925
[grunting]

11:04.968 --> 11:07.144
- Hey, Sully.
Is it hurting now?

11:07.188 --> 11:08.580
- It is, yeah.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.104
Did you figure out
what's happening, doc?

11:10.147 --> 11:12.323
- Your leg is showing signs
of an infection

11:12.367 --> 11:15.326
called clostridial myonecrosis,
or gas gangrene.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.938
- From what?
- A combination of soft tissue

11:17.981 --> 11:20.680
damage and bacteria
from an external source

11:20.723 --> 11:22.420
that can enter the body
through abrasion.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.422
We need to get you upstairs
to surgery right now.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.860
- Gangrene. Does that mean--

11:26.903 --> 11:28.557
They're not gonna
take my leg, right?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.516
- If they can debride only
the infected tissue, no, but--

11:31.560 --> 11:33.736
- It's possible.
- Look, the infection

11:33.780 --> 11:35.172
in your leg is very
aggressive, okay?

11:35.216 --> 11:37.000
It can be life-threatening
in a matter of hours.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.828
The OR is waiting.
If there anyone you want us

11:38.872 --> 11:40.177
to call to be here with you?

11:40.221 --> 11:43.398
- Yeah, yeah.
My girlfriend Greta.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.140
What's going on?

11:46.183 --> 11:47.402
- I'll find out.

11:47.445 --> 11:48.838
The porters are on their way
with the gurney.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.319
Okay, we'll be sure
to call Greta.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.712
- Yeah.

11:53.103 --> 11:56.846
- We'll get that skewer out and
then manage his bleeding.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.892
Looks like bits of rust
everywhere,

11:58.935 --> 12:00.154
they'll need to come out.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.851
- I can help guide the camera
if you want?

12:01.895 --> 12:04.593
- Hal and I are exclusive.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.856
Oh, damn it.
Something sprung a leak.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.250
Dr Curtis, locate and control.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.606
- Got it!

12:17.649 --> 12:20.217
- Good. Next step.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.698
- What's happening?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.178
- What the hell?

12:24.221 --> 12:26.658
- Should we extract the trocars
and the camera?

12:26.702 --> 12:28.922
- Camera, yes, let's hold on
the trocars

12:28.965 --> 12:31.315
for when the power
comes back on.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.840
Removing them blind might cause
more harm than good.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.798
- The CO2 stopped pumping!
- Stay calm.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.278
Take him off the vent and bag.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.628
Get the propofol out of the pump
and drip it by gravity

12:39.671 --> 12:41.108
in case he wakes up and moves.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.893
Lily, get some lights
until backup power kicks in.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.243
- Okay. I'm on it.
- Oh, damn it.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.769
[hubbub]

12:49.812 --> 12:51.945
- Yeah, yeah.
Here too.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.860
The generator
should've kicked in.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.905
We're doing a bed count now.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.778
Let us know if there's anything
we can send to ICU

12:58.821 --> 13:00.780
to keep you functional.
- Doctor Atwater?

13:00.823 --> 13:02.738
- Yeah?
- I've got a gangrenous leg

13:02.782 --> 13:04.348
that requires immediate surgical
intervention.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.568
Is the OR running?
- The elevators are down.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.484
The OR has no backup power,
the whole building is dark.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.400
[panting]

13:28.503 --> 13:30.810
[alarm ringing]

13:32.115 --> 13:33.987
- It didn't look like
that before.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.163
- Because it's necrotizing.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.342
- The power's not
coming back on, is it?

13:41.385 --> 13:43.474
- They're trying to figure out
what went wrong,

13:43.518 --> 13:45.302
but it might take some time.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.131
- You said I needed
to get to surgery now
or this could kill me.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.655
Does that mean
I can't get there?

13:50.699 --> 13:52.222
- Unfortunately, yes.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.879
- Then you need to help me here.
In emergency.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.968
- With how quickly this
is spreading,

13:59.012 --> 14:00.274
even if you could get to OR,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.319
the only option left
is amputation.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.367
- Then what are we waiting for?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.717
- I need to be sure
you understand what you're
asking us--

14:08.760 --> 14:10.675
- Yeah! I understand
it's a choice,

14:10.719 --> 14:12.547
between life and death.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.985
Do it!

14:16.507 --> 14:18.596
[dramatic music]

14:21.948 --> 14:23.819
Got maintenance to unlock
the vending machine

14:23.863 --> 14:26.082
and thankfully,
these are still cold.

14:26.126 --> 14:29.869
If it is heatstroke,
we have to watch for cardiac
complications.

14:31.087 --> 14:34.612
Your son needs an ECG
to check his heart,

14:34.656 --> 14:36.440
but without power, we can't.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.487
We can take blood,
but we can't run labs yet.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.624
[automated voice]:
I'm the babysitter.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.888
It's my first week with Cohen.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.195
- The parents are where?

14:52.456 --> 14:54.545
[automated voice]: About to be
very pissed at me.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.460
We were supposed to be
at home,

14:56.504 --> 14:58.854
but I was taking him
to a roller-coaster.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.118
- It's not your fault the subway
got stuck between stations.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.338
[automated voice]: Except now
I've got their sick kid

15:04.381 --> 15:06.601
in a place
you can't help him.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.823
- Do we have any
battery-powered fans?

15:11.867 --> 15:15.349
- You'd have to ask maintenance.
Dr Atwater's on her way.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.438
- The kid in 3,
he has heat stroke.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.049
He needs an IV and someone
in there every five minutes
with cold water.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.181
- We'll do our best.
- Rhoda!

15:21.224 --> 15:22.617
He's been there
20 minutes

15:22.660 --> 15:24.358
and no one's gone in there
to see him.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.925
And where's the ASL interpreter
I ask you for?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
- I put in the request,
I mean, it's chaos.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.364
They'll get here when they--
- Why don't you do your job--

15:30.407 --> 15:32.888
- Dr Hunter!
No turning on each other.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.630
We stay focused while
this gets sorted, understood?

15:37.197 --> 15:39.286
Right! All we're hearing

15:39.329 --> 15:42.593
is that the generator system is
experiencing cascading failure.

15:42.637 --> 15:46.423
Maintenance is on it,
but they don't know why or how

15:46.467 --> 15:48.991
or for how long,
but it is hospital-wide,

15:49.035 --> 15:51.820
which means there's no access
to labs, medical records,

15:51.863 --> 15:53.387
or imaging.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.823
Where the critically ill
can be moved

15:54.866 --> 15:57.086
to other hospitals, we will.
When patients are acute,

15:57.130 --> 16:00.437
we rely on clinical observation
and response.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.657
Resources are obviously low,

16:02.700 --> 16:05.573
so we need to conserve
where possible.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.401
Alright, let's get to it!

16:07.444 --> 16:08.880
- What's going on?

16:08.924 --> 16:10.882
- When I came to check in,
he passed out.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.581
- His blood oxygen is still low.
What is it with these machines,

16:13.624 --> 16:15.539
they give you 20 minutes
of battery power?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.672
- Rhoda, start bagging.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.022
- Eddie Jennings. He came in
with shortness of breath.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.111
Bloods are not back
and I guess they won't be.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.766
Dr Mitchell did a consult.
Is that his chart?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.637
- Mm-hmm.
- Psychiatrist scrawl.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.075
Does that say "god"?
- I think it's an A.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.338
Generalized anxiety disorder?

16:31.381 --> 16:33.122
Doesn't explain his resp rate,

16:33.166 --> 16:35.646
but we're sending
all our ventilators up to ICU.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.954
- Mr Kazinsky in E
and Ms Olivier in 1,

16:38.998 --> 16:41.522
they both just came off
theirs, so I thought we could--

16:41.565 --> 16:43.350
- I'm gonna need nurses
to bag in shifts.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.613
I pulled three phlebotomists
to help

16:45.656 --> 16:48.485
since nobody's going to be going
for blood right now.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.445
- I'll take the first shift,
boss.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.012
- Thank you.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.582
- Dr Hamed?

16:58.626 --> 17:00.932
- 33-year-old male
with a gangrenous limb.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.804
I've watched his tissue degrade
by the minute

17:02.847 --> 17:04.980
and there's no way around it.
We have to amputate.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.809
I gave him a spinal block and
a sedative.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.680
And since the power went out,

17:09.723 --> 17:12.857
his foot and ankle have gone
from bronze to reddish purple.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.816
- Let me get this straight.
You want to perform

17:14.858 --> 17:16.992
an amputation in my trauma bay
in the dark?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.733
- I'm the only doctor
in this department

17:18.776 --> 17:21.736
with the experience to do it.
I'm not going to let him die.

17:23.128 --> 17:26.001
- Arnold, we'll need
a tourniquet, warmed saline.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.915
- And as much light
as you can get.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.657
- Copy that.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.627
- My TV went out,

17:44.367 --> 17:46.848
we might as well get this
over with.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.635
- Arnold, suction.
- Yep.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.986
- You need to tie off
the anterior tibial artery.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.553
- Hemostat.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.512
Arnold!

17:58.555 --> 18:00.601
- I'm trying, I can't keep up
with the blood.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.516
- BP's still dropping.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.648
- Tighten the tourniquet.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.959
Dr Bishop, I need your hands!
- Bashir, you know I can't.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.527
- I need your help to find
the bleed and clamp it.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.398
You're the only other doctor
in the room

18:15.442 --> 18:18.271
and this patient is dying!
Please.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.708
- Alright.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.580
- There's inflammation
and necrosis everywhere.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.931
- Then we'd better get to work.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.980
- Tell me when you have it, sir.
[sighing]

18:32.937 --> 18:34.635
Sir?

18:36.811 --> 18:39.683
- There's the bleeder, got it.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.902
- Let's get ready to cut.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.947
Arnold?
- Suctioning.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.692
- Tibial artery tied off.
Scissors?

18:49.302 --> 18:51.652
- If you keep the distal end
of the muscle and attach it

18:51.695 --> 18:53.567
to the periosteum of
the tibial bone,

18:53.610 --> 18:55.177
it stabilizes for
prosthetic fitting.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.745
His colour's off.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.487
[beeping]
- Battery's dead.

19:00.530 --> 19:04.143
- I'm putting pressure
on his nail bed to check
capillary refill time.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.408
Six seconds.
He's lost too much blood.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.844
- Two more bags of blood
product.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.107
- That's our last bag.
I sent Janie 10 minutes ago,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.283
but she hasn't come back yet.
- It's chaos upstairs.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.764
- I'm A-neg.
- O positive.

19:16.807 --> 19:19.158
- Has to be O-neg.
That's me, but--

19:19.201 --> 19:20.289
- You've got to cut.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.773
- Six flights of stairs,
but we have blood units.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.992
- Gigli saw.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.695
- Steady on, Dr Hamed.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.740
- Cutting now.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.880
- Alright, our biggest risk here
is hemorrhagic shock.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.621
We're gonna need manual BP
and blood pressure

19:47.664 --> 19:49.231
every minute
until we're back up.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.015
Any news on the generator when
you were out there?

19:51.059 --> 19:53.192
- We're literally in the dark.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.325
But Dr Curtis, they asked
to pass along a message to you.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.589
You didn't mention
your father's here.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.288
- Yeah. Uh, my brother's
with him.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.593
- Apparently not.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.987
And with the power failure,

20:06.030 --> 20:08.816
they had to take him off
his vent.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.818
- Did he come off?

20:10.861 --> 20:15.214
- Yes, but, they don't know
for how long.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.608
- I, uh...

20:19.261 --> 20:20.958
I'm gonna help you here
with the trocars.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.178
It is mayhem out there, you're
gonna have a very hard time

20:23.222 --> 20:24.875
finding another resident.
- June.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.399
Lily, Richie and I,
we'll be fine.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.489
- I really need to make sure
that this guy is...

20:29.532 --> 20:31.795
stable first.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.798
[gentle music]

20:38.106 --> 20:39.934
- Here, let me--
- Oh no, no, no.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.762
Leave it. Leave it.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.766
Only half-full, but it'll do.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.294
- You really shouldn't be
smoking.

20:52.338 --> 20:56.211
- Yeah, and you really shouldn't
be lying to me.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.780
My ass, you're here to thank me.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.435
I've treated hundreds
of patients.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.175
You know how many show up at
my house to...

21:04.219 --> 21:07.135
offload unsolicited
gratitude?

21:09.224 --> 21:10.399
Just you.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.969
- A baby died on me last week.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.537
Heart defect.

21:18.059 --> 21:21.105
We treated him,
we thought he was okay,

21:21.149 --> 21:24.935
and then he was just...
gone.

21:24.979 --> 21:28.504
- You want me to say something
that'll make you feel better,

21:29.723 --> 21:31.812
but nothing can.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.249
Which I think you know.

21:37.383 --> 21:40.342
Put your glass in the sink
on your way out.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.865
- I'm not leaving.

21:41.909 --> 21:45.347
- Look, have I not made myself
clear? I can't help you.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.871
- Well, I can't leave a sick
old man alone

21:47.915 --> 21:50.787
with half a tank of oxygen
in the middle of a blackout!

21:52.789 --> 21:54.878
No, thank you.

21:57.838 --> 22:01.798
- Relax, it probably won't
explode.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.326
[hubbub]

22:11.852 --> 22:15.029
- Sir, if we settle
the lawsuit,

22:15.072 --> 22:17.814
we move on with our lives.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.775
- If you accept the blame when
you didn't do anything wrong,

22:21.818 --> 22:24.908
that mark will follow you
for every job you want

22:24.952 --> 22:26.606
the rest of your life.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.216
Since when did you not want
to fight?

22:28.259 --> 22:30.392
- Sir, they're not wrong
about me.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.264
My transcripts?
- Let me worry about those.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.441
- This hospital is the only
chance I have

22:35.484 --> 22:36.920
and they want me to settle.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.358
- Look how they've treated me
here, Bashir.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.143
There's no real loyalty
anymore.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.102
Just the choices you've made.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.985
[grunting in pain]

22:59.290 --> 23:01.031
[in Arabic]:

23:51.778 --> 23:52.822
His BP is low.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.433
- Well, there's no ECG
on the menu,

23:54.476 --> 23:57.000
but we can do a clinical exam
the way we used to.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.654
Hi there.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.572
Is there an oscillation point?

24:03.616 --> 24:06.575
- Posterior to
the sterno-mastoid.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.841
Seven centimetres
above the sternal angle.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.627
- What does that mean?
Am I having a heart attack?

24:14.670 --> 24:17.499
- No. Your jugular venous
pressure tells us

24:17.543 --> 24:19.370
that the muscle is under strain.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.156
We'll start a medication
called beta blockers

24:22.199 --> 24:23.853
and we watch you closely.
Yeah?

24:23.897 --> 24:26.290
Stellar job keeping us
afloat today, Wendy,

24:26.334 --> 24:28.249
through all the chaos.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.599
- I need to ask, Jed.

24:30.991 --> 24:35.604
With all the candidates
you've been interviewing
for the chief position.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.302
- Why haven't you been asked?

24:38.346 --> 24:41.392
- I feel I merit consideration.

24:41.436 --> 24:42.872
- No doubt, no doubt, Wendy.

24:42.916 --> 24:47.094
But the truth is these
interviews are lip service.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.489
I have no intention
of being replaced.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.755
- Sully.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.719
What happened?

25:05.329 --> 25:06.896
- I fell.

25:06.940 --> 25:10.552
- Maybe because you were hanging
off a mountain with no rope.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.425
- I know every inch
of that rock, Greta.

25:14.469 --> 25:16.253
There was no reason
for that to happen.

25:16.297 --> 25:19.605
- You talk all the time
about the variables
out of your control.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.129
A broken rock, a gust of wind.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.479
Those are the risks.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.828
- It wasn't that.

25:27.264 --> 25:29.049
I need to know why.

25:30.659 --> 25:33.096
How soon can I get out of here?

25:33.140 --> 25:36.273
- You're still fighting off
the infection, Sully.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.058
And you've lost
a great deal of blood.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.930
- I need to get back
out there and understand
what happened, okay?

25:40.974 --> 25:44.064
- Sully, how?

25:51.506 --> 25:53.595
- It still feels like
it's there.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.729
- That's not uncommon.

25:56.772 --> 25:59.166
But normally, that feeling
does go away.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.865
- I should've died on
that mountain.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.656
- What kind of medicine
did you say you practice?

26:10.699 --> 26:13.310
- I didn't. Emergency.

26:13.354 --> 26:16.749
Also, I'm doing a resident
practice in cardiology.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.359
- You're wasting your time
with those.

26:18.402 --> 26:21.536
They've been stuck shut longer
than you've been alive.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.539
- I was just trying to give you
a breeze.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.846
- Why are you hell bent
on fixing me?

26:26.889 --> 26:28.978
I thought you were here
for my help.

26:29.022 --> 26:32.678
- Were you always this rude
and I just don't remember or...?

26:34.201 --> 26:36.638
- Finally, she says something
interesting.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.598
Look, just because you think
I saved you as a kid

26:39.641 --> 26:41.556
doesn't mean that
I can save you now.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.951
- Okay, you made your point.
- I don't even know you.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.214
- It's okay! I get it!
I'm gonna go.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.217
- But I do remember you.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.309
You needed a heart-lung bypass.

26:59.052 --> 27:04.100
Your parents were terrified
and useless.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.235
But you...

27:10.716 --> 27:13.849
You were notably stubborn.

27:13.893 --> 27:17.026
Which is apparently
a quality you've not lost.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.291
- You told me if I fought,
you would fight for me too.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.251
And you did.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.428
- I didn't hold up my end.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.084
You still needed
the damn pacemaker, Mags.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.219
- You were the first person
to ever call me that.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.051
- I didn't save you.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.097
I failed you.

27:45.838 --> 27:50.625
But what was I
supposed to do? Quit?

27:55.282 --> 27:57.763
[gentle music]

28:02.332 --> 28:05.988
- He wants his parents.
- Where are they?

28:06.641 --> 28:10.253
- Out with friends,
a couple hours out of town.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.777
But they're almost back.

28:12.952 --> 28:16.520
- Your fever's lower.
Which is good news.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.653
Your belly is still swollen.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.656
Can you tell me how you feel?

28:22.483 --> 28:23.832
Can you squeeze my finger?

28:26.313 --> 28:27.749
- He doesn't like it here.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.709
- Guys, heat stroke
can cause kidney failure.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.754
His swelling is cause
for concern,

28:32.798 --> 28:35.104
but I can't do an ultrasound
right now,

28:35.148 --> 28:37.803
so I need to know what
he's feeling.

28:39.935 --> 28:43.939
- He says he's scared and...

28:43.983 --> 28:47.160
your face is making it worse.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.467
- My face?

28:50.511 --> 28:52.382
- Yeah.

28:52.426 --> 28:56.038
He reads it to understand tone.

28:57.518 --> 29:00.173
- So he's telling me
to calm down.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.002
- Yeah.

29:05.308 --> 29:06.788
- Hey, Cohen.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.182
Do you feel like this?

29:12.098 --> 29:14.578
[chuckles]
No? Okay, it's good.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.450
What about confusion?

29:16.493 --> 29:18.278
Do you know where you are?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.544
[gentle music]

29:23.936 --> 29:26.808
- Uh... In a room with a weirdo?

29:26.852 --> 29:30.464
[chuckling]
- Good, so no confusion.

29:31.247 --> 29:32.858
What are you feeling?

29:40.387 --> 29:44.826
- He hasn't gone to
the bathroom in six days.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.307
- So he's got to poop!

29:47.350 --> 29:48.874
But he can't?

29:49.439 --> 29:52.007
Constipation can be
exacerbated by extreme heat

29:52.051 --> 29:54.009
which we've been having

29:54.053 --> 29:56.403
and that would explain
the distention.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.840
We'll try a glycerin
suppository

29:58.884 --> 30:00.189
and we'll know in 15 minutes.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.975
This is something
we can fix, buddy.

30:03.889 --> 30:07.240
What's the sign for good job?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.071
- Good job.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.946
- Okay.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.863
[indistinct chatter]

30:24.083 --> 30:26.389
- Did you send him for tests?
- No, why?

30:26.433 --> 30:28.957
- He asked me to get him water.
When I came back he wasn't here.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.437
- He got himself out of bed?

30:30.480 --> 30:32.874
- The way he was talking before.
- What do you mean?

30:32.918 --> 30:35.050
- He never tells me before
he goes climbing.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.226
So that I don't have to say
goodbye if he doesn't come back.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.228
- Look, he just had
a major surgery,

30:39.272 --> 30:41.883
it would be pretty hard
for him to get very far.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.929
- You don't know Sully.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.453
Please, find him.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.893
- Hey, Charlie. It's... It's me.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.722
I'm here with him and they...

30:55.201 --> 31:01.511
They had to make a call on who
to bag for breathing and...

31:02.948 --> 31:06.038
His DNR means no life-saving
measures,

31:06.081 --> 31:09.302
so if you could just hurry up
and get here.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.834
You stubborn bastard.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.929
Well, Marcus...

31:29.104 --> 31:30.801
You win.

31:30.845 --> 31:34.588
Whatever it is
you've been holding on for,
now's your chance.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.026
Here I am.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.341
[heavy breathing]

31:57.524 --> 31:59.004
Dad?

32:02.572 --> 32:04.052
Dad.

32:08.404 --> 32:11.320
[dramatic music]

32:13.714 --> 32:16.543
[machine beeping]

32:26.031 --> 32:27.902
- Hello, sir. Quite the day.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.730
- Have you managed
all your patients?

32:29.773 --> 32:31.688
- We got through it okay.
- Good.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.517
I've been meaning to speak
to you about your attitude.

32:34.561 --> 32:37.172
You've been short-tempered
and dismissive lately,

32:37.216 --> 32:38.869
and it's been noticed.

32:38.913 --> 32:42.308
- Did someone say something?
- No, that's not the point.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.658
And I know the toll
a divorce can take.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.660
But when I offered you
this job,

32:46.703 --> 32:48.662
it's like you were
a different person.

32:49.358 --> 32:50.707
- Maybe I was.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.883
- You should focus on getting
yourself together,

32:52.927 --> 32:56.409
otherwise, this becomes
a bigger conversation.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.895
[panting]

33:05.766 --> 33:08.551
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

33:10.945 --> 33:12.642
- Sully!

33:13.643 --> 33:16.211
- Greta figure out where I was?

33:16.777 --> 33:19.519
- She said you always find
a way to go up.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.044
She's checking the other wing
of the building.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.439
- And you want to know if
I'm gonna jump?

33:26.482 --> 33:29.790
- I just thought you
shouldn't be up here alone.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.708
- I let you take my leg
because...

33:34.751 --> 33:37.885
my instincts are always
to survive, but...

33:39.104 --> 33:41.019
Sitting here now, man,

33:41.671 --> 33:44.848
God, I really wished
they weren't.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.069
[gentle music]

33:49.418 --> 33:51.768
[indistinct communication
on PA]

33:54.989 --> 33:57.600
- Do we know what's wrong
with Eddie yet?

33:57.644 --> 34:00.516
- Waiting on labs now that
the power's back.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.866
Any news on new vents?

34:02.910 --> 34:04.999
- With patients decompensating
both in ICU

34:05.043 --> 34:07.219
and in the middle of aborted
surgeries,

34:07.262 --> 34:09.264
they're all still spoken for.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.092
30 years I've never seen
that happen.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.748
What's that redness
on his arms?

34:15.270 --> 34:16.750
Scratch marks?

34:16.793 --> 34:19.969
- We didn't notice that
before and then it went dark.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.494
The guy has been itchy.

34:21.536 --> 34:24.149
- There's no hives,
so it's not topical.

34:24.192 --> 34:27.108
That could correspond to any
number of underlying conditions.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.893
- How about side effects? He was
asking for antidepressants,

34:29.937 --> 34:33.462
said he was taking lorazepam
and those can give rashes,

34:33.505 --> 34:35.333
but don't depress
respiratory rate.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.770
- But opioids can.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.859
Maybe he tried another
little pick-me-up

34:38.902 --> 34:41.905
and Benzos can enhance
the effects of painkillers.

34:42.906 --> 34:45.779
And if our friend
here accidentally overdosed...

34:47.085 --> 34:48.737
- Naloxone?

34:58.487 --> 35:01.577
[suspenseful music]

35:03.188 --> 35:05.494
[gasping]

35:08.018 --> 35:09.150
- There you are.

35:10.673 --> 35:13.459
- Claire, 4 needs rush labs
and the gentlemen in B

35:13.502 --> 35:15.069
needs his urinary bag changed.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.289
- She's with a patient.
Can Arnold deal with that?

35:17.332 --> 35:18.855
- It's still chaos out here,
Dr Bishop.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.466
- No problem, Dr Atwater.
I'm on it.

35:20.509 --> 35:21.945
- Thank you.

35:22.729 --> 35:23.904
- It'll just take time.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.689
- They'll always see me
as a nurse, Jed.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.176
[gentle music]

35:36.873 --> 35:38.832
- Welcome back, Dr Curtis.

35:38.875 --> 35:42.096
- How is he doing?
- Miraculously stable.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.577
And you, June?

35:45.404 --> 35:48.015
- Fine.
So what's the plan?

35:48.058 --> 35:50.844
- Now that he's open,
we don't have much choice,

35:50.887 --> 35:52.237
even with the power back on.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.761
We'll have to remove
all the remaining fragments

35:54.804 --> 35:57.198
by hand before we lavage.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.332
Thought I'd show you
how I learned.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.116
Old school.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.640
If you're up for it.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.208
- I am, thanks.

36:10.080 --> 36:14.215
- The power had to come back on
just so I could get up here.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.609
- I can understand how that
might make you feel.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.393
- I bet you do.

36:18.915 --> 36:21.179
You cut my leg off in the dark.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.877
Is it killing you now
just standing there?

36:23.920 --> 36:25.879
Not being able to help me?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.143
You sit down, if you want.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.927
- Actually I'm...

36:32.581 --> 36:34.583
I'm afraid of heights.

36:36.716 --> 36:39.022
I've never told anyone that.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.243
- But you're not, really.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.289
No one is.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.163
You're just afraid of the fall.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.913
[city rumble]

37:07.703 --> 37:10.140
- You know even if
I don't jump,

37:11.011 --> 37:13.361
I'm still going to feel like
this tomorrow.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.973
- Maybe.

37:20.977 --> 37:23.241
But maybe not the day
after that.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.204
- Is it helping?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.814
Sitting this close?

37:32.293 --> 37:34.252
- I'm fighting through it.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.130
- Um...

37:43.173 --> 37:45.175
We should go.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.178
Greta will worry.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.622
- Hey. You're back?
- Yeah.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.885
Guess I'm a glutton
for punishment.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.759
- Hey, Mags,

38:03.803 --> 38:06.806
I'm really glad they're not
suing you anymore.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.851
- Thank you.
[rapid beeping]

38:11.463 --> 38:13.378
Eddie?
Eddie can you hear me?

38:13.421 --> 38:14.857
- Pulseless V-tach.
Do you know him?

38:14.901 --> 38:16.642
- Yeah, I saw him this morning
for shortness of breath.

38:16.685 --> 38:18.861
Turns out he'd accidentally
OD'd on benzos.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.472
Jesus. This guy's had a day.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.388
The naloxone they gave him,

38:23.431 --> 38:26.086
it's rare, but it can cause
cardiac arrhythmias.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.783
I'll get a crash cart.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.314
[coughing]

38:37.967 --> 38:39.795
- Dude!

38:39.839 --> 38:41.754
Did you just punch me?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.452
- It's called
a precordial thump.

38:45.453 --> 38:48.761
He just reset your heart rhythm.
He just saved your life.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.589
You'll be okay now.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.025
- Thanks.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.593
- Do you normally take opioids,
Eddie?

38:54.636 --> 38:56.421
- No, no.

38:56.464 --> 38:59.380
It's just been a stressful time,
you know?

38:59.424 --> 39:02.427
- Our psychiatrist made
a referral. You're gonna
follow up?

39:02.470 --> 39:04.646
- Yeah.
- I know you were worried about

39:04.690 --> 39:06.518
leaving and getting your
things but--

39:06.561 --> 39:08.346
- She probably torched them
all already.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.870
But I guess I don't have
to move huh?

39:10.913 --> 39:12.915
[laughing]

39:13.438 --> 39:16.702
- Eddie, glad you're back
with us!

39:16.745 --> 39:19.313
- Arnold will give you more
fluids and an ECG

39:19.357 --> 39:20.836
to check your rhythm.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.709
- I'll get you all set up,
Eddie, don't you worry.

39:32.413 --> 39:33.762
- What about you?

39:33.806 --> 39:36.286
What are you gonna do
with their offer?

39:37.287 --> 39:39.246
- We're not going to take
the deal.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.379
We're going to fight this.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.256
[gentle music]

39:49.299 --> 39:50.866
[sighs]

39:51.998 --> 39:54.217
- Hey, Perry?

39:54.957 --> 39:58.657
Theo Hunter. I want a timeline
on when my work will be done.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.224
- Geez, bud. I already told you,
that's not happening.

40:01.268 --> 40:04.227
- Then I need you
to give me back my deposit.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.404
- Or what?
You're gonna do what?

40:06.447 --> 40:08.362
Sue me? Fire me?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.320
Because then you'd be eating
the money.

40:10.973 --> 40:14.237
Look, just... We'll get to your
place when we get there, okay?

40:14.281 --> 40:15.978
- Perry?

40:17.110 --> 40:19.025
- Ow! What the hell?

40:19.068 --> 40:20.461
Ah!

40:20.505 --> 40:23.377
- I'm so sorry, you--
- Get the hell away from me!

40:27.425 --> 40:30.079
[laughing]
[all]: Hey!

40:30.123 --> 40:32.952
- I figured you guys
would still be here.

40:32.995 --> 40:36.477
Alright, we have two with
pineapple, and one without.

40:36.521 --> 40:37.913
- You're an angel.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.654
- Good to know you're spending
that fancy raise

40:39.698 --> 40:41.482
in the right place.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.136
- Here you go.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.964
Oh, thanks.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.577
You guys killed it today.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.274
- Cheers.

40:52.188 --> 40:54.364
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.802
- Listen,

40:57.629 --> 40:59.718
You were being really nice
this morning

40:59.761 --> 41:03.069
and I was a jerk.
- You were? About what?

41:03.112 --> 41:05.724
- Transcribing Oliver's chart.

41:05.767 --> 41:09.467
- Okay. It's fine.
Water?

41:13.819 --> 41:16.082
- I guess I'm still like...

41:16.125 --> 41:18.084
[sighing]

41:19.172 --> 41:22.044
Still messed up about
losing him.

41:23.045 --> 41:25.439
And the past few months
have been...

41:25.483 --> 41:27.267
- The worst?

41:27.310 --> 41:29.095
- The worst!

41:31.184 --> 41:32.925
- My Dad died.

41:32.968 --> 41:36.450
Here. Earlier today.
I was alone with him.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.800
- June!

41:40.454 --> 41:42.151
Are you...

41:42.761 --> 41:44.893
I mean...

41:46.547 --> 41:48.331
How long has he been sick?

41:49.942 --> 41:53.206
- Well, we didn't really...

41:55.382 --> 41:57.471
[soft music]

42:00.474 --> 42:02.171
I don't know

42:13.487 --> 42:15.184
- I'm sorry.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.236
[dog barking
in the distance]

42:26.369 --> 42:27.893
- Theo?

42:30.112 --> 42:32.201
- I think I broke it.

42:32.811 --> 42:34.943
- What happened?

42:38.033 --> 42:40.427
- I messed up, Bash.

42:44.649 --> 42:47.869
Everything is messed up.

42:52.352 --> 42:54.876
[gentle music]

43:21.599 --> 43:23.644
Subtitling: difuze
