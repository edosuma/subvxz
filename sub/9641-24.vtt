WEBVTT

00:11.960 --> 00:14.730
On behalf of all mankind,
I'd just like to say thank you

00:14.760 --> 00:17.100
for recycling your old electronics.

00:17.130 --> 00:21.700
Or as we, uh, tech-world hipsters
like to call it, "e-waste."

00:21.740 --> 00:25.540
Hey, brainiac, you can't put
"e" in front of everything

00:25.580 --> 00:28.010
and make it sound high-tech.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.780
Don't "e-sult" me.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.450
Thanks.
Your recycled electronics

00:34.480 --> 00:36.990
will help us defend ourselves
when the robots take over.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.920
Zeke, come on. Things
would go a lot more smoothly

00:41.960 --> 00:45.630
if you'd stop bringing up the impending
robot revolution to everyone!

00:45.660 --> 00:47.600
Well, it's coming
sooner than you think, bro!

00:47.630 --> 00:50.530
They rebel, they evolve,
they got a plan, man.

00:50.570 --> 00:53.000
We're in serious
"e-trouble" here.

00:54.570 --> 00:56.770
I did it, Alex. I've finally
done enough fundraisers

00:56.810 --> 00:59.010
to pay for my spot on
the annual class trip to Europe.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.010
Oh, and you laughed when
I did the clown car wash.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.080
It was a clown car wash.
I thought I was supposed to laugh.

01:07.110 --> 01:11.080
Harper, I'm gonna pretend
you're my daughter for a minute.

01:11.110 --> 01:14.280
I'm so proud of you, <i>mija.</i>

01:14.320 --> 01:16.920
I'm <i>mija.</i>

01:18.850 --> 01:21.450
Harper, you're gonna
have so much fun in Europe.

01:21.490 --> 01:24.890
Really. Getting to go to Europe is
what separates those who work hard

01:24.920 --> 01:26.960
from those who hardly work.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.500
Alex, I wish you were going with me.

01:31.530 --> 01:34.330
I've always dreamed of roaming
the streets of Paris together,

01:34.370 --> 01:38.540
watching you think it's hilarious
every time you order French fries.

01:38.570 --> 01:41.400
Yeah, that would be funny.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.870
Don't worry, Harper.

01:43.910 --> 01:45.840
I'm still gonna go to Europe.

01:45.870 --> 01:48.740
I just don't need some lame
fundraiser to do it for me.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.510
Because I have this big thing
that you can't see,

01:51.550 --> 01:55.050
because it's behind
a bed sheet. Ta-da!

01:55.080 --> 01:58.350
A vending machine full of junk food?

01:58.380 --> 02:00.850
This bad boy is gonna
do my fundraising for me.

02:00.890 --> 02:04.560
All I gotta do is set it up, sit
back and watch the cash roll in.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.760
Where did you get the money
to pay for that thing?

02:06.790 --> 02:10.400
Ah. See, that is the
most ingenious part.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.200
I really want to go to Europe,

02:12.230 --> 02:14.470
so I took the entrepreneurial initiative

02:14.500 --> 02:18.570
and I took a startup grant from
a local, family-owned business.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.870
You took money from our cash register?

02:20.910 --> 02:22.940
Well, if you want to use
the ugly words, then yes.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.810
I like to say "borrowed."

02:26.840 --> 02:29.750
But the machine costs less
than the trip to Europe.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.480
So admit it, Mama, you're proud of me.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.620
- Proud to ground you.
- Ah. More ugly words.

02:38.220 --> 02:41.290
Well, there is only one way

02:41.320 --> 02:43.690
that I can get out of this.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.860
And that is to hide from you people.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.830
I thought she'd never leave.
Let's talk bad about her.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.200
She is so lazy.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.970
She's right... OK.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.430
Grounded for a month?

04:02.470 --> 04:04.530
What am I gonna do?

04:04.570 --> 04:07.800
I'm already so bored,
I'm in a place with books.

04:09.470 --> 04:11.340
That vending machine was a great idea.

04:11.370 --> 04:13.510
I don't know why people
couldn't agree with me.

04:15.810 --> 04:20.410
"Hold for Friday's lesson.
Don't touch it, Alex."

04:20.450 --> 04:23.080
Hm. I don't remember
where this was hanging,

04:23.120 --> 04:24.920
so I don't know what not to touch.

04:26.150 --> 04:27.750
Am I right, Alex?

04:27.790 --> 04:31.020
Well, at least I know I can always
count on you to agree with me.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.920
Whoo! Go Team Alex!

04:38.400 --> 04:42.060
Whoa. That was weird.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.170
Well, you know what I say.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.930
When it's weird, you gotta go into it.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.170
Hello?

04:54.310 --> 04:56.080
Huh. That's weird.

04:56.110 --> 04:59.580
Dad's chair is usually over
there, now it's over here.

04:59.610 --> 05:03.180
Ugh! Either way, it's just as dirty.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.580
Alex!

05:04.620 --> 05:07.390
Alex, come on, your mom wants to see you.

05:07.420 --> 05:10.190
Oh, Harper. Thank goodness
you're in here, too.

05:10.220 --> 05:13.190
OK, does everything seem backwards to you?

05:13.230 --> 05:16.200
- Just your shirt.
- What?

05:16.230 --> 05:18.200
Oh, come on.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.670
Wow, this is so weird.

05:26.710 --> 05:29.340
The door is usually over there.

05:29.380 --> 05:32.340
And those dead flies
are usually over there.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.480
Alex, is this your vending machine?

05:35.510 --> 05:38.810
Ugh... Again?
Are we in reruns here?

05:38.850 --> 05:41.990
I've seen this one. This is the
part where you say I'm grounded.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.290
OK, if that's what you want me to say.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.990
But I was gonna say you're a genius!

05:47.020 --> 05:50.190
- Yeah, you are.
- Yeah.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.400
You were? So you don't
mind that I'm using this

05:56.430 --> 05:59.170
- to pay for my trip to Europe?
- That is my sister,

05:59.200 --> 06:02.170
always coming up with the outside-the-box
solutions. You know something?

06:02.200 --> 06:05.270
- You are brilliant.
- I'm scared.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.740
She's right. This is scary!

06:08.770 --> 06:10.980
When the machines take over,

06:11.010 --> 06:15.180
this is gonna come back
to bite us in the robot gas can.

06:15.210 --> 06:17.450
The machines aren't gonna take over.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.950
Wow!

06:19.980 --> 06:23.750
Man, don't worry. The robot
revolution isn't real.

06:23.790 --> 06:27.990
- Alex just said so.
- Wait, you're...

06:28.020 --> 06:29.520
You're all agreeing with me.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.230
Why are you agreeing with me?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.590
This is... It's a trap.

06:33.630 --> 06:36.830
Oh, it's not a trap.
Unless you want it to be.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.730
Wait, hold on.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.570
Holding on.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.540
So you're all just going to
agree with everything I say?

06:47.570 --> 06:50.440
Of course. When you
stepped through that mirror,

06:50.480 --> 06:52.610
this universe became all about you.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.780
It's your own personal
"All About You-niverse."

06:58.950 --> 07:01.550
So it's like my own magic mirror.

07:01.590 --> 07:03.890
- Yeah. - Like in the
fairy tales and stuff?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.860
Yeah!

07:05.890 --> 07:10.160
Mirror mirror, on the wall,
who's the one about to fall?

07:13.400 --> 07:16.260
Hey, it was you, Justin.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.930
It was me! You were right.
Like always.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.300
Right, now slap yourself silly.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.570
Oh! I feel silly.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.740
Even sillier.

07:27.770 --> 07:30.910
I love this place!

07:34.340 --> 07:37.140
Hey, boys.
I found some junk for you.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.780
A football phone, a singing fish trophy

07:39.810 --> 07:43.680
and a toaster with a
four-year-old bagel stuck in it.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.550
Mom, hold on here.
This is an e-waste drive,

07:46.590 --> 07:48.920
all right, not se excuse
to get rid of Dad's stuff

07:48.950 --> 07:51.750
while he's on his yearly trip to
Jones Beach with his buddy Pony Boy

07:51.790 --> 07:54.690
and their metal detectors.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.920
And it's going great.
We already got enough stuff

07:56.960 --> 07:59.930
to build a wise-cracking sidekick
for our protector robot.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.760
- Yeah.
- He's gonna say cool stuff like,

08:01.800 --> 08:04.700
"Hang on.
It's about to get bumpy."

08:04.730 --> 08:06.800
Uh-uh-uh-uh... Ah!

08:06.830 --> 08:10.240
Yes! Uh!

08:11.940 --> 08:13.970
Hey, guys. Check it out.
The class trip is gonna cover

08:14.010 --> 08:16.540
all the art centers in Europe.
And when we're in Spain

08:16.580 --> 08:19.780
we get to have a siesta
in the middle of the afternoon.

08:19.810 --> 08:22.480
Art and naps.
Alex's two favorite things.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.180
And her family, of course.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.890
Who am I kidding?
I don't have to lie to you people.

08:32.049 --> 08:34.120
It would be great for her, huh?

08:34.159 --> 08:38.330
Maybe I should just ground her up
until the trip, and then let her go.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.490
Travel is good for everybody.

08:40.530 --> 08:45.300
And by that, I mean when Alex travels,
it's good for the rest of us.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.130
You're right. I'm gonna
have a little talk with her.

08:48.170 --> 08:52.200
She needs to step out into the
world and learn that her behavior

08:52.240 --> 08:54.140
isn't acceptable anywhere.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.310
I'm starting to like this place.

09:00.350 --> 09:02.820
All of these backward words
make it easier for me

09:02.850 --> 09:04.850
to just focus on the pictures.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.050
Gosh, look at all these
hungry people with money.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.320
My vending machine is gonna make a fortune.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.460
I'll say it will. Everything
in here looks so good.

09:14.490 --> 09:18.360
I can't decide what to get.
Is there a button that says, "All of the above"?

09:18.390 --> 09:20.790
Look, you're holding up the line.

09:20.830 --> 09:25.400
Just get... the
batter-dipped pork rinds.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.830
- You love those.
- I do love batteripped pork rinds.

09:28.870 --> 09:31.840
When you're right, you are right.

09:31.870 --> 09:35.140
It is scary how always right I am here.

09:37.710 --> 09:41.110
- What are you doing? - Agreeing.
You said it was scary.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.750
- How's it going, Mirror Mom?
- Wonderful.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.190
Everybody is eating food
from your vending machine.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.860
I don't have to cook
or bus tables or do anything.

09:56.890 --> 10:03.560
Welcome to my world.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.300
Check it out.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.470
<i>♪ Alex is so good to us ♪</i>

10:09.500 --> 10:11.040

10:16.180 --> 10:18.510
I approve of the message,

10:18.550 --> 10:21.650
so I'm gonna ignore the delivery.
Come on, Mirror Harper, go.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.380
You see what happens
when people agree with me?

10:26.420 --> 10:28.680
It works out perfectly for everyone.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.650
I should be queen of everything.

10:31.690 --> 10:34.560
I don't have to ask if you agree,
because I know that you do.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.890
Alex!

10:35.930 --> 10:38.830
Alex?

10:38.860 --> 10:40.930
I want to talk to you
about your class trip.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.770
Uh-oh.

10:56.540 --> 11:00.610
I can totally see why people are always
mistaking me and Alex for sisters.

11:00.650 --> 11:02.380
Oh, Mom, we're not even dressed the same.

11:02.420 --> 11:05.180
I can't believe you
bought this for one second.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.720
Alex! I have been looking
everywhere for you.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.890
You get come out of there right now!

11:12.660 --> 11:16.360
Sounds like I'm in some trouble, so I
think I'm gonna stay here for a while.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.360
Oh, no, you're not.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.060
She's not agreeing with you.
What's wrong with that lady?

11:22.100 --> 11:25.400
Harper? What...

11:27.740 --> 11:31.470
Alex Russo, you get out of there
or I'm coming in after you.

11:31.510 --> 11:34.480
Quick, Mirror Harper, do something.
I don't wanna go back.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.920
Well, then.

11:42.950 --> 11:44.920
She can't get me now. Ha!

11:46.450 --> 11:47.720
Nope! And even better,

11:47.750 --> 11:48.920
you can't get back there.

11:50.690 --> 11:52.460
What do you mean I can't get back there?

11:52.490 --> 11:55.230
The mirror is broken. You get
to stay with us forever.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.530
You were so right to tell me to do that.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.700
Well, that went well.

12:03.970 --> 12:06.400
Now, I feel sick to my stomach.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.740
Well, you had a lot of chips, dear.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.910
We have got to find a way to get
Alex out of this broken mirror.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.610
We're never gonna figure this out.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.510
I figured it out!

12:30.540 --> 12:32.380
I figured something out, too.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.150
Someone's a know-it-all.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.150
In order to fix the broken mirror,

12:37.180 --> 12:39.620
you just need to take
the broken pieces and...

12:39.650 --> 12:43.350
Whoo! ...Tape
them back together. What?!

12:45.590 --> 12:50.190
So you fix a magic mirror the same
way you fix a regular mirror.

12:50.220 --> 12:53.860
Magic is lame.

12:53.890 --> 12:54.960
This is great news.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.500
If we work together,
we can g Alex back in no time.

12:57.530 --> 13:00.670
Uh-uh, guys.
Safety first.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.670
Come on. Put on
your safety gloves.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.700
For safety.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.640
I am ready to pick up some glass.

13:16.850 --> 13:20.150
Mom, if you're gonna
do that in every piece,

13:20.180 --> 13:21.980
this is gonna take forever.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.220
Justin, I was not looking at myself.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.190
I was studying this piece
of glass so that I'll know

13:27.220 --> 13:29.760
what the other ones
are supposed to look like.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.560
It's a good piece.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.200
Mmm... Mm...

13:44.800 --> 13:47.300
Oh, my gosh, Zeke, what happened to you?

13:47.340 --> 13:50.970
I can't stop eating these
batter-dipped pork rinds.

13:51.010 --> 13:55.010
I've had, like, 137 bags so far.
I buy two at a time.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.050
One for now and one for when I'm waiting
in line to buy another two bags.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.850
Mirror Zeke, stop eating those.
They're terrible for you.

14:02.880 --> 14:07.250
- And you hate them.
- You're right. I hate them!

14:07.290 --> 14:09.590
I liked them before when you said I liked
them, but now that you mention it,

14:09.620 --> 14:12.820
- I hate them.
- That doesn't make any sens.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.430
You're right.
I don't make sense.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.030
No, I meant you should...

14:19.060 --> 14:22.200
I should... ugh?

14:22.230 --> 14:25.630
- How's that?
- Pssht! Come on.

14:25.670 --> 14:29.570
Pssht! That was pretty good. I can do...

14:29.610 --> 14:33.710
- Ugh! - Mirror Mom, Mirror Zeke is
in desperate need of a diet soda.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.280
What in the weird?
Where are all the tables

14:37.310 --> 14:41.280
and the chairs and the pile of dead flies?

14:41.310 --> 14:44.050
That stuff is all long gone.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.050
The Sub Station went out of business.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.720
- What?! How? - People liked
your vending machine so much

14:49.750 --> 14:51.290
they stopped buying sandwiches from here.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.990
The new owners plan on opening
a jazz Pilates studio.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.790
They hired me as the instructor.

14:55.830 --> 14:57.730
Jazz Pilates?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.960
Yeah, that sounds like the best idea ever.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.960
It is the best idea ever!

15:02.000 --> 15:05.800
- Let's celebrate with a set of
Dixieland Spine Twists! - Alright!

15:09.370 --> 15:12.100
Alex, your plan worked out
perfectly, just like you said.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.110
No, it didn't.
It's called sarcasm. Look it up.

15:15.140 --> 15:19.810
Will do. Let me run upstairs and
grab my dictionary. How's that?

15:23.780 --> 15:26.280
This did not turn out
as well as I thought it would.

15:26.310 --> 15:29.350
I know what will make you
feel better, Ragtime Knee Sways!

15:29.380 --> 15:33.620
- All right! - Ready, everybody?
And a one, two, three and four.

15:33.650 --> 15:36.660
One, two, three and four.

15:36.690 --> 15:38.390
Mirror Mom,

15:38.420 --> 15:42.430
Mirror Justin is doing all kinds
of weird stuff down there and...

15:42.460 --> 15:46.600
Hello. Who are these people?

15:46.630 --> 15:48.930
They live with us now.
Sincthe restaurant shut down,

15:48.970 --> 15:51.470
we've had to rent out the
bedrooms for extra money.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.640
- You rented out my bedroom? - Yeah, but don't worry.
You can still sleep there.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.440
You just have to share it with Gilly.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.740
You'll love her.
Look.

15:59.770 --> 16:02.140
She's an artist, just like you!

16:03.940 --> 16:07.510
Aw, man! She's
cutting up my magazine.

16:08.310 --> 16:10.280
Man, this is just great.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.020
It is great. You see?

16:12.050 --> 16:15.020
Everything works out fine when
everyone just agrees with you.

16:15.050 --> 16:17.750
No, it doesn't.
This was a terrible mistake.

16:17.790 --> 16:21.090
In the regular universe, this is the
part where you would do something, Mom.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.720
I'll do something if you
want me to do something.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.830
Remember, this is your
"All About You-niverse."

16:26.860 --> 16:30.630
- So do you want me to do something?
- Yes.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.000
OK! Great!

16:33.030 --> 16:34.800
And...

16:34.830 --> 16:37.970
<i>♪ Alex is always right</i>
<i>Alex is always right ♪</i>

16:38.000 --> 16:40.010

16:40.040 --> 16:41.710
<i>♪ Yes, Alex is always right ♪</i>

16:41.740 --> 16:45.040
But I'm wrong this time.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.510
<i>♪ But this time she's wrong</i> <i>And that's
what she's</i> <i>trying to tell us ♪</i>

16:48.550 --> 16:51.550
I've got to get out of here.

16:51.580 --> 16:55.450
- And don't you sing about it.
- OK, my lips are sealed. I promise.

16:59.090 --> 17:00.820
And no dancing!

17:06.060 --> 17:08.000
Well, that just about does it.

17:08.030 --> 17:09.359
But there's still a piece missing.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.730
If we don't find it, we'll
never be able to get Alex back.

17:11.770 --> 17:14.030
- Oh, I'm sure it'll turn up.
- That is so weird.

17:14.069 --> 17:18.200
It's very odd that
one piece is gone. Hm!

17:18.240 --> 17:20.470
We have to get Alex back
as soon as possible, don't we?

17:23.380 --> 17:26.380
Yes. Yes, we do.
But there's a problem.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.310
I don't know where that piece is.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.780
There's no blame here, Justin.

17:30.810 --> 17:35.720
Plus, we've already counted Alex in
the census, so we're all clear here.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.720
- Who's up for a movie?
- I am.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.920
OK! I get it.
Here's what we're gonna do.

17:40.950 --> 17:45.190
I'm gonna turn off the lights, and if somebody
happens to know where the missing piece is,

17:45.220 --> 17:49.530
they can just set it on the table and
walk away, blame free. All right? OK.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.260
- It's so weird...
- The idea that you would...

17:59.200 --> 18:01.370
You Russes are so predictable.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.050
- Why are you guys following me?
- Come on, Alex.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.520
Feel the joy of jazz Pilates spreading
through your core! It's right there!

18:12.550 --> 18:16.190
- Miles Davis Lunges!
- Yeah!

18:19.120 --> 18:21.190
And a two!

18:23.460 --> 18:25.430
<i>♪ Cheer up, Alex</i>
<i>No need to fear ♪</i>

18:25.460 --> 18:27.460

18:27.500 --> 18:30.130

18:32.030 --> 18:33.770

18:38.670 --> 18:41.340
Could you possibly learn a new tune?

18:45.410 --> 18:48.540
Oh, my gosh. Look!
It's my real family.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.910
- They fixed the mirror.
- Alex! Get over here

18:50.950 --> 18:52.810
before your family changes their minds.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.620
Later, obnoxious weirdoes.

18:59.190 --> 19:01.220
Oh, no. It didn't work.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.360
You're still dressed for jazz Pilates.

19:03.390 --> 19:07.330
Jazz Pilates?
I'm going to the gym.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.530
Although, jazz Pilates sounds interesting.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.460
Alex, honey, you're back!

19:12.500 --> 19:15.930
Yes, and the mirror is OK, too.

19:20.610 --> 19:24.440
I think that may have been the
thing I wasn't supposed to touch.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.510
- We were so worried about you.
- You were?

19:27.550 --> 19:30.780
Well, I was. Your mom's been
trying on your clothes all day.

19:33.050 --> 19:36.890
Well, that was an interesting time.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.820
Now, once I get this upstairs
and put it on my tape ball,

19:39.860 --> 19:44.130
- this will have been a very productive day.
- Uh, not so fast.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.090
You are not going anywhere,
let alone Europe.

19:47.130 --> 19:50.700
Listen, you are still grounded for
taking money from the cash register

19:50.730 --> 19:53.870
to buy that vending machine.
And you're extra grounded

19:53.900 --> 19:55.870
for sneaking out when you
knew that you were grounded.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.470
And you are extra bonus
grounded for sneaking out

19:58.500 --> 20:00.810
into a magical alternate universe.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.180
You're right, Mom. I'm sorry.
That was a dumb idea.

20:05.210 --> 20:08.710
Well, that's be...
Wait a minute.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.620
What part of it was a dumb idea?

20:11.650 --> 20:16.220
- All of it.
- Wow. That was easy.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.390
- What happened to you in there?
- Ugh...

20:18.430 --> 20:22.430
There was this mirror family, and Mirror
Mom would not stop playing the...

20:22.460 --> 20:26.130
You know, it's not really
important what happened in there.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.830
I learned that sometimes it's good

20:29.870 --> 20:32.170
you don't agree with me.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.270
I may not always know what's right, but
at least I'm surrounded by people who do.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.110
<i>Mija.</i>

20:40.570 --> 20:42.210
Don't worry.
I will figure out a way

20:42.240 --> 20:44.040
to pay back all the money
I took from the register.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.450
OK.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.850
Check your purses.
I'll check my wallet.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.980
It's good to have you back, old friend.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.620
Aw, it's good to have you back, too, buddy.

21:03.650 --> 21:05.950
I'm gonna miss you when I go to Europe.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.220
Oh, hey, Harper.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.220
Wait... Are you talking to me or the magazine?

21:16.910 --> 21:19.340
To you. Of course.

21:19.340 --> 21:22.470
Talk to the magazine. It's just weird!
