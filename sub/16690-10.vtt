00:02.464 --> 00:04.164
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.164 --> 00:06.098
Chef Ramsay
is in Pasadena, California,

00:06.098 --> 00:08.931
to help a struggling
Jamaican restaurant.

00:08.931 --> 00:10.964
That is disgusting crap.

00:10.964 --> 00:12.931
It's an insult to Jamaica.

00:12.931 --> 00:14.798
Proud owner, Dr. Una Morris,

00:14.798 --> 00:17.131
runs her restaurant
with an iron fist...

00:17.131 --> 00:18.331
I'm coming in,

00:18.331 --> 00:19.531
because I don't like
what's going on.

00:19.531 --> 00:21.731
Micromanaging every detail.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.131
This cannot
be like this.

00:23.131 --> 00:24.164
Are you working
on this?

00:24.164 --> 00:25.298
Get it out now.

00:25.298 --> 00:26.664
On top of that,

00:26.664 --> 00:28.931
Her practices
are completely bizarre.

00:28.931 --> 00:30.000
You're running
a hospital kitchen

00:30.000 --> 00:30.364
You're running
a hospital kitchen

00:30.364 --> 00:31.998
full of bags.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.331
And she listens to no one,

00:33.331 --> 00:34.598
Not even her son.

00:34.598 --> 00:36.364
I've been telling you
since day one.

00:36.364 --> 00:42.131
Jamaican food cannot
be cooked fresh every day.

00:42.131 --> 00:43.498
Chef Ramsay is
in for a battle...

00:43.498 --> 00:44.564
Let me finish.

00:44.564 --> 00:45.864
Let me finish
my sentence first.

00:45.864 --> 00:47.398
That might be impossible to win.

00:47.398 --> 00:48.898
I wouldn't walk
into your hospital

00:48.898 --> 00:50.631
and attempt
to tell you your job.

00:50.631 --> 00:52.864
I am telling you.

00:52.864 --> 00:54.398
Gordon tries to give the doctor

00:54.398 --> 00:55.864
a prescription
for success.

00:55.864 --> 00:57.164
I'm here to help you.

00:57.164 --> 00:58.964
No, you don't understand
what I'm going through.

00:58.964 --> 01:00.000
But she might just be
too stubborn to accept it.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.964
But she might just be
too stubborn to accept it.

01:00.964 --> 01:02.698
You're in denial.

01:02.698 --> 01:04.464
I'm not in denial.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.464
Tonight, on Kitchen Nightmares.

01:27.364 --> 01:29.830
Pasadena, California,

01:29.830 --> 01:30.000
home to the Kingston Cafe,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.697
home to the Kingston Cafe,

01:31.697 --> 01:33.564
an authentic
Jamaican restaurant

01:33.564 --> 01:35.630
owned by Dr. Una Morris,

01:35.630 --> 01:38.230
who not only
is a practicing radiologist,

01:38.230 --> 01:40.430
but is a three-time Olympian.

01:40.430 --> 01:42.664
all my life
I was able to accomplish

01:42.664 --> 01:44.164
the things
I really wanted to do.

01:44.164 --> 01:46.064
And so I started
the restaurant

01:46.064 --> 01:47.497
because I really
enjoy cooking,

01:47.497 --> 01:49.997
and there were no other
Jamaican restaurants around.

01:49.997 --> 01:52.030
One negril jam steak,
medium rare.

01:52.030 --> 01:55.064
you know, my son is the manager,

01:55.064 --> 01:57.630
but we don't necessarily
see things eye to eye.

01:57.630 --> 01:58.964
Keone,
please be quiet.

01:58.964 --> 02:00.000
I'm talking.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.730
I'm talking.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.497
She doesn't really listen
to my suggestions,

02:02.497 --> 02:05.097
and I've gotten
to a point where

02:05.097 --> 02:06.230
I can't deal with this.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.497
Everything has to be
cooked to order.

02:07.497 --> 02:09.564
I know.

02:09.564 --> 02:10.864
You can't cook
everything to order.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.030
Impossible.
Not here.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.397
She micromanages.

02:13.397 --> 02:15.264
She's focusing
on small details

02:15.264 --> 02:17.730
like tablecloths
being an inch off.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.130
It's not even.

02:19.130 --> 02:20.097
See, one side
over there

02:20.097 --> 02:21.830
is longer
than the other.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.330
But the biggest focus

02:23.330 --> 02:25.797
Should be why don't we have
any more customers?

02:25.797 --> 02:27.564
I still see dust.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.397
All of these
have to change.

02:29.397 --> 02:30.000
See, you have
to set standard.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.030
See, you have
to set standard.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.197
If you don't
set standard,

02:32.197 --> 02:34.364
how you expect
something to run well?

02:34.364 --> 02:36.364
These knife and forks
are unacceptable.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.764
I don't like
how some of these look.

02:37.764 --> 02:38.764
You see?

02:38.764 --> 02:40.230
Sorry, Dr. Morris.

02:40.230 --> 02:42.530
Everyone gets a bit nervous

02:42.530 --> 02:44.330
When she's around,
even myself.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.564
Dan?
Yes.

02:45.564 --> 02:46.797
They need
their food now.

02:46.797 --> 02:48.064
There are four people
out there

02:48.064 --> 02:50.264
haven't even gotten
their second yet.

02:50.264 --> 02:51.897
Lots of cooks
come in and out.

02:51.897 --> 02:52.930
They're there for one day,

02:52.930 --> 02:54.297
then you never
see them again.

02:54.297 --> 02:56.597
Remember the salt is one
of the most important things.

02:56.597 --> 02:58.597
Not everybody
can cook Jamaican food.

02:58.597 --> 02:59.630
We can't sell this.

02:59.630 --> 03:00.000
I don't like
how it tastes at all.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.164
I don't like
how it tastes at all.

03:01.164 --> 03:04.397
It's kind of hard for someone
to expect you to do a job,

03:04.397 --> 03:05.764
and then they keep
stepping in

03:05.764 --> 03:07.430
and not allowing
you to do it.

03:07.430 --> 03:08.697
Mom, mom,
you gotta let him work.

03:08.697 --> 03:10.130
It's not gonna--

03:10.130 --> 03:12.097
when she's in the kitchen,
it slows things down.

03:12.097 --> 03:13.830
This cannot be like this.

03:13.830 --> 03:16.697
The plantain is hanging
over the edges.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.264
It creates a conflict
when getting plates out,

03:19.264 --> 03:21.430
and then we have to deal
with the customers

03:21.430 --> 03:22.397
who are not happy.

03:22.397 --> 03:23.597
Sorry about the wait.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.864
The restaurant's drowning,

03:26.864 --> 03:27.931
and we're all
going down with it.

03:27.931 --> 03:29.797
We don't get no customers.

03:29.797 --> 03:30.000
You'd be lucky if you get
five tables in all day.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.231
You'd be lucky if you get
five tables in all day.

03:32.231 --> 03:33.997
I know, it's bad,
isn't it?

03:33.997 --> 03:36.297
If it doesn't
change soon,

03:36.297 --> 03:38.064
it's gonna die.

03:38.064 --> 03:39.797
I cannot sleep

03:39.797 --> 03:42.764
because
I have so much debt.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.497
And my money for my retirement
is almost dried up.

03:46.997 --> 03:49.230
Keone convinced me
that Gordon Ramsay

03:49.230 --> 03:50.830
would help the restaurant.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.397
Something has to be done.

03:52.397 --> 03:55.397
Chef Ramsay's
my last resort.

04:00.063 --> 04:01.797
After a phone call
early this morning,

04:01.797 --> 04:04.863
Chef Ramsay decides
to make a detour

04:04.863 --> 04:06.063
before heading
to the restaurant.

04:06.063 --> 04:07.097
How are you, sir?

04:07.097 --> 04:08.430
I'm all right.
Good to see you.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.797
Dr. Morris' son, Keone,

04:09.797 --> 04:11.230
has requested a meeting,

04:11.230 --> 04:13.397
and Chef Ramsay
has obliged.

04:13.397 --> 04:14.530
How's it going?

04:14.530 --> 04:16.063
Um, difficult times.

04:16.063 --> 04:17.163
Really?
For sure.

04:17.163 --> 04:18.497
Probably doing
about 30%

04:18.497 --> 04:19.763
of what we were doing
over the summer.

04:19.763 --> 04:20.997
Wow.

04:20.997 --> 04:23.497
What's the number one
problem, Keone,

04:23.497 --> 04:24.630
in the restaurant?
what is it?

04:24.630 --> 04:26.030
I would say
my mother's management.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.097
Really?

04:27.097 --> 04:28.997
She's very much
a micromanager

04:28.997 --> 04:30.000
and likes to rule
with an iron fist.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.763
and likes to rule
with an iron fist.

04:30.763 --> 04:32.597
If I implement something,
she would get angry,

04:32.597 --> 04:34.130
and she would want
to implement

04:34.130 --> 04:35.563
her version of a way
of doing things.

04:35.563 --> 04:36.997
Oh, dear,
that's mixed messages,

04:36.997 --> 04:38.463
and more importantly,
how confusing for

04:38.463 --> 04:39.963
not just the customers,
but for the team?

04:39.963 --> 04:42.097
Exactly. Like, you have
to realize, like,

04:42.097 --> 04:43.097
she came from Jamaica

04:43.097 --> 04:44.530
essentially by herself.

04:44.530 --> 04:46.330
She's a physician
in radiology.

04:46.330 --> 04:47.697
Okay, fantastic.

04:47.697 --> 04:48.930
She's been
to the Olympics.

04:48.930 --> 04:50.330
Olympics?
Yes.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.797
That is
one disciplined woman.
Right?

04:51.797 --> 04:53.530
So she's tough.
Yeah, absolutely.

04:53.530 --> 04:54.830
How tough on a scale
of one to ten?

04:54.830 --> 04:55.930
35.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.430
Oh, jeez.
Yeah.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.000
My mom,
what she says goes,

05:00.000 --> 05:00.063
My mom,
what she says goes,

05:00.063 --> 05:01.697
and it definitely does

05:01.697 --> 05:03.830
have its strain
on the business.

05:03.830 --> 05:06.597
It looks like a...
A residence.

05:06.597 --> 05:07.763
I would have driven
right by it.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.030
Hey, Mom?

05:11.030 --> 05:12.330
That's too small.

05:12.330 --> 05:14.097
That is too small.
You can't ser--

05:14.097 --> 05:15.163
okay, I'll get
another one.

05:15.163 --> 05:16.163
Let's go, let's go.

05:16.163 --> 05:17.963
Here, mom,
can I take over in here?

05:17.963 --> 05:20.163
No, no, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.197
Hello.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.597
How are you?
Good.

05:23.597 --> 05:25.330
Nice to see you.
Just one?

05:25.330 --> 05:27.430
Can hardly recognize
it's a restaurant out there.

05:27.430 --> 05:28.763
It looks like a house
from the outside.

05:28.763 --> 05:29.830
It doesn't look
like a restaurant

05:29.830 --> 05:30.000
it's very homey.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.897
it's very homey.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.163
Where are we going?

05:32.163 --> 05:33.697
We're going
to the main dining room.

05:33.697 --> 05:34.930
Okay, main dining room,
right.

05:34.930 --> 05:35.997
It's a strange entrance.

05:35.997 --> 05:37.063
Hello.

05:37.063 --> 05:38.163
Dr. Morris?

05:38.163 --> 05:39.097
How are you?

05:39.097 --> 05:40.597
I'm really blessed
seeing you.

05:40.597 --> 05:41.997
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

05:41.997 --> 05:43.197
My name is Una,

05:43.197 --> 05:44.830
but everybody
is calling me Dr. Morris.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.530
Wow. Okay.

05:46.530 --> 05:47.830
Doctor, good to see you.

05:47.830 --> 05:49.163
What's that in there?

05:49.163 --> 05:50.497
that's curried goat.

05:50.497 --> 05:51.763
Excellent.
Who made that?

05:51.763 --> 05:54.297
The chef, under
the supervision of me.

05:54.297 --> 05:55.530
Wow, and are you always
in the kitchen or...?

05:55.530 --> 05:56.630
I do everything

05:56.630 --> 05:58.430
just to make sure
everything runs okay.

05:58.430 --> 05:59.597
Right.
Who's the head chef?

05:59.597 --> 06:00.000
That would be me.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.930
That would be me.

06:00.930 --> 06:02.130
Young man,
good to see you.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.497
And first name is?
Daniel.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.530
The menu
was designed by?

06:05.897 --> 06:07.263
Oh, you do the menu?

06:07.263 --> 06:09.063
Yes.

06:09.063 --> 06:10.663
Good to meet you all.

06:10.663 --> 06:11.597
Can't wait
to taste it.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.097
Thank you.

06:15.097 --> 06:17.697
And here's the lunch menu.
Excellent.

06:17.697 --> 06:19.163
Thank you very much.

06:19.163 --> 06:20.530
And your server
will be right with you.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.630
Thank you.

06:21.630 --> 06:23.130
Wow.

06:23.130 --> 06:24.463
Bizarre menu.

06:24.463 --> 06:26.397
Looks like something out
of an office filing cabinet.

06:26.397 --> 06:28.297
Hi, there.
How are you doing?

06:28.297 --> 06:29.730
Starving.
How are you?

06:29.730 --> 06:30.000
I'm very well, thank you.
I'm Matthew.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.897
I'm very well, thank you.
I'm Matthew.

06:30.897 --> 06:31.897
Great accent.
Thank you.

06:31.897 --> 06:32.930
How long
have you been here?

06:32.930 --> 06:33.997
Almost two years.

06:33.997 --> 06:35.497
I met Dr. Morris.

06:35.497 --> 06:37.630
Dr. Morris can be a little
overbearing sometimes.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.963
It's just the way

06:38.963 --> 06:40.197
she wants everything
to be perfect.

06:40.197 --> 06:41.463
Why do we have
to call her "doctor"?

06:41.463 --> 06:43.663
Uh, that's just...
She's Dr. Morris.

06:43.663 --> 06:45.330
But even
in a restaurant?

06:45.330 --> 06:47.097
Yes. The doctor's
office is next door.

06:47.097 --> 06:48.963
Literally next door?
Literally next door.

06:48.963 --> 06:50.963
What a headache.
Oh, believe me.

06:50.963 --> 06:53.497
I think she's really
taken on too much.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.197
I personally think
she's slowly but surely

06:55.197 --> 06:56.930
running herself
into an early grave.

06:56.930 --> 06:59.963
We have salad that
need to take out now.

06:59.963 --> 07:00.000
It's for Matt's table.
It doesn't matter.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.063
It's for Matt's table.
It doesn't matter.

07:01.063 --> 07:02.097
It needs
to be taken out.

07:02.097 --> 07:03.430
No, we're taking it
right now.

07:03.430 --> 07:05.063
So I'll go
for the Jamaican patties.

07:05.063 --> 07:07.030
One veg and one beef.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:07.030 --> 07:08.897
Got to, got to,
got to have the hot flashes.

07:08.897 --> 07:10.030
Okay, sir.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.630
Which is
your jerk chicken, right?

07:11.630 --> 07:13.030
That's
our signature dish, yes.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.397
It looks like you're
having some hot flashes.

07:14.397 --> 07:15.563
You all right?

07:15.563 --> 07:16.463
Yeah.
It's hot in here.

07:16.463 --> 07:17.630
Is it?
Yeah.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.530
Plus it's wearing
this get-up as well.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.997
I feel like I'm
at a funeral sometimes

07:21.997 --> 07:22.930
when I come to work.

07:22.930 --> 07:23.963
Wow.

07:23.963 --> 07:25.430
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

07:25.430 --> 07:26.863
"Famous jerk chicken
marinated in secret jerk sauce."

07:26.863 --> 07:28.497
What's the secret
behind it?

07:28.497 --> 07:30.000
The owner of the restaurant
makes the sauce.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.763
The owner of the restaurant
makes the sauce.

07:30.763 --> 07:31.997
Really?

07:31.997 --> 07:33.663
The owner pretty much
does everything.

07:33.663 --> 07:34.897
I'm not even sure
the cooks

07:34.897 --> 07:36.297
even make the sauce.
seriously.

07:36.297 --> 07:37.863
The chef doesn't even know
the secret behind the sauce?

07:37.863 --> 07:40.263
No.

07:40.263 --> 07:41.997
Uh...

07:41.997 --> 07:43.097
Ooh la la.

07:43.097 --> 07:44.363
I've just spotted,
mind you,

07:44.363 --> 07:45.363
$20.
that can't be right.

07:45.363 --> 07:46.597
Well, it must be

07:46.597 --> 07:47.997
a phenomenal oxtail
at $20.

07:47.997 --> 07:49.663
Yeah, it's good.

07:49.663 --> 07:50.697
Let's have that
as well.

07:50.697 --> 07:52.130
Okay.
Excellent.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.497
Not stop sweating
and relax.

07:54.730 --> 07:56.863
Okay, let's see
what we got, guys.

07:56.863 --> 07:58.363
Two Jamaican patties,

07:58.363 --> 08:00.000
one beef, one veggie,

08:00.000 --> 08:00.063
one beef, one veggie,

08:00.063 --> 08:02.497
jerk chicken
and one oxtail.

08:02.497 --> 08:04.497
Okay. Let's go, you guys.

08:04.497 --> 08:06.763
We need to get the Jamaican
patties first, please.

08:06.763 --> 08:08.097
Yes, Dr. Morris.

08:08.097 --> 08:10.463
Everything's soulless.
It's...

08:10.463 --> 08:12.163
It's lacking charm.

08:12.163 --> 08:13.430
It's like eating
inside of a...

08:13.430 --> 08:15.197
An office block.

08:15.197 --> 08:16.330
Not good.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.563
Tell them let's go.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.430
They're going.
They can't go any faster.

08:19.430 --> 08:20.563
Do we have
the jerk sauce?

08:20.563 --> 08:22.363
Coming out right now.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.997
Dan?
Yes, Dr. Morris.

08:24.997 --> 08:26.463
We need
the next plate.

08:26.463 --> 08:27.563
Are you working
on this?

08:27.563 --> 08:28.563
Yes, Dr. Morris.

08:28.563 --> 08:29.630
Okay.

08:29.630 --> 08:30.000
Beef Patty.
Yep.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.863
Beef Patty.
Yep.

08:30.863 --> 08:32.497
With a little bit more
jerk sauce there.

08:32.497 --> 08:34.097
And this is
the veggie Patty.

08:34.097 --> 08:37.430
Okay, I'll leave you
to enjoy those.

08:37.430 --> 08:38.930
Thank you.

08:40.863 --> 08:42.530
Ah.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.197
Absolutely gross.

08:44.197 --> 08:45.663
That sauce is dreadful.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.963
The pastry's raw.

08:51.963 --> 08:54.163
Soggy pile of dough.

08:54.163 --> 08:55.363
They'd  kidnap me

08:55.363 --> 08:56.963
If I served that
in Jamaica right now.

08:56.963 --> 08:58.730
How are the patties?

08:58.730 --> 08:59.997
Um, the sauce
is dreadful.

08:59.997 --> 09:00.000
I don't
like it myself.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.030
I don't
like it myself.

09:01.030 --> 09:01.963
It's like a gloop.

09:01.963 --> 09:03.163
Sad news about the Patty,

09:03.163 --> 09:05.330
the pastry's undercooked.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.463
It's hideous, hideous.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.497
Let me get rid
of these for you.

09:07.497 --> 09:08.663
And this one is?

09:08.663 --> 09:10.230
The jerk chicken
"hot flash."

09:10.230 --> 09:11.430
Is that
the same sauce?

09:11.430 --> 09:12.497
Yes.

09:12.497 --> 09:13.663
Take that away, please,
darling.

09:13.663 --> 09:14.863
Take this away?
You got it.

09:14.863 --> 09:16.030
Thank you.

09:16.030 --> 09:18.063
Look at my rice.
It looks like a silicon implant.

09:18.063 --> 09:19.897
Perfectly formed.

09:19.897 --> 09:21.297
Ugh.

09:21.297 --> 09:24.330
Guys, do not put any more
jerk sauce on his plate.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.763
He hates it.

09:25.763 --> 09:26.830
Ugh.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.063
Nasty.

09:28.063 --> 09:29.863
There's not an ounce
of seasoning there.

09:29.863 --> 09:30.000
Cold.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.030
Cold.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.263
How's our signature dish?

09:32.263 --> 09:34.663
Bland as.

09:34.663 --> 09:35.797
Cold chicken,

09:35.797 --> 09:38.063
disgusting
overcooked rice.

09:38.063 --> 09:39.297
And when was
that chicken cooked?

09:39.297 --> 09:40.630
I couldn't tell you
to be honest with you.

09:40.630 --> 09:41.597
Go and ask the doctor,

09:41.597 --> 09:42.763
because it's dry as hell.

09:42.763 --> 09:43.963
Will do.
Thank you.

09:47.230 --> 09:49.630
When was the chicken made,
Dr. Morris?

09:49.630 --> 09:51.097
What?
He didn't like it?

09:51.097 --> 09:53.163
No,
he said it was dry.

09:53.163 --> 09:54.263
You know why?

09:54.263 --> 09:56.030
Jerk chicken
is dry in Jamaica.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.830
It's supposed
to be dry.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.197
He doesn't eat
Jamaican food every day.

09:59.197 --> 10:00.000
I eat it every day,

10:00.000 --> 10:00.463
I eat it every day,

10:00.463 --> 10:02.763
so I don't know what he knows
of jerk chicken.

10:02.763 --> 10:04.930
This is our oxtail stew
and Lima beans.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.297
Ugh. Cartilage
everywhere.

10:09.363 --> 10:10.397
What a mess.

10:10.397 --> 10:12.430
$20.

10:12.430 --> 10:13.530
How was the, uh, oxtail?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.263
Sadly,
nothing's been trimmed,

10:15.263 --> 10:16.630
so it's full of fat.

10:16.630 --> 10:18.363
Bland.

10:18.363 --> 10:19.663
And the temperature,

10:19.663 --> 10:20.897
I mean, everything
across the board here

10:20.897 --> 10:22.697
was sort of
barely lukewarm.

10:22.697 --> 10:24.230
Okay, let me get rid
of that for you.

10:24.230 --> 10:25.197
What an embarrassment.

10:33.563 --> 10:34.763
You're on the right side.

10:34.763 --> 10:35.797
Exactly.

10:35.797 --> 10:37.463
Okay.

10:37.463 --> 10:39.663
Doctor.

10:39.663 --> 10:41.763
I would like
a word with you.

10:41.763 --> 10:43.863
I'm not afraid
of Chef Ramsay.

10:43.863 --> 10:45.530
I'd like to talk
to you and Keone.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.463
Even if he had horns,
I wouldn't be afraid of him.

10:47.463 --> 10:49.763
Okay, I'm...
I'm embarrassed.

10:49.763 --> 10:51.997
I walk in a dining room

10:51.997 --> 10:53.863
that felt cold

10:53.863 --> 10:55.797
and just flat.

10:55.797 --> 10:57.530
When the food arrives,

10:57.530 --> 10:59.630
soulless.

10:59.630 --> 11:00.000
Everything was horrendous.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.263
Everything was horrendous.

11:02.263 --> 11:03.930
Barely lukewarm,

11:03.930 --> 11:07.063
dry and tasteless.

11:07.063 --> 11:09.663
It's an insult
to Jamaica.

11:09.663 --> 11:11.697
The patties,
the actual pastry

11:11.697 --> 11:14.130
on the side was raw.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.630
As for the jerk sauce,

11:16.630 --> 11:18.763
disgusting.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.597
I'm gonna say this.
Um, from the get-go,

11:20.597 --> 11:22.130
I always felt
that everything

11:22.130 --> 11:23.263
should be fresh,
cooked to order.

11:23.263 --> 11:24.530
Okay, Keone!
Keone?

11:24.530 --> 11:26.197
Could you be quiet?
He's talking.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.930
Okay, let's move on,
shall we?

11:29.930 --> 11:30.000
I've got bigger issues.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.263
I've got bigger issues.

11:31.263 --> 11:33.930
Honestly,
"hot flashes"?

11:33.930 --> 11:38.463
Isn't that
a symptom of menopause?

11:38.463 --> 11:39.930
Not necessarily.

11:39.930 --> 11:41.163
Not necessarily?

11:41.163 --> 11:42.897
Depends on how
you perceive it.

11:42.897 --> 11:44.263
Forget the strange name.

11:44.263 --> 11:47.530
That dreadful jerk chicken,

11:47.530 --> 11:48.530
dry?

11:48.530 --> 11:50.063
Just a minute.

11:50.063 --> 11:52.563
Let me set you straight.

11:52.563 --> 11:54.397
Most jerk chicken
in Jamaica are dry.

11:54.397 --> 11:56.230
That's right. Dry rub.

11:56.230 --> 11:58.030
Let me finish.

11:58.030 --> 11:59.797
I feel
that the jerk chicken

11:59.797 --> 12:00.000
that we do
are more moist

12:00.000 --> 12:01.297
that we do
are more moist

12:01.297 --> 12:02.963
than the one
they do in Jamaica.
Right.

12:02.963 --> 12:04.897
Now, let me tell you
something also.

12:04.897 --> 12:06.130
Let me finish.

12:06.130 --> 12:07.597
Let me finish
my sentence first.

12:07.597 --> 12:09.630
Mostly dry I can accept.

12:09.630 --> 12:11.663
Dry and inedible,
I can't.

12:13.430 --> 12:14.663
I'm ready
for an argument.

12:14.663 --> 12:16.230
'Cause I am
not gonna sit here

12:16.230 --> 12:17.763
and kiss your ass

12:17.763 --> 12:18.830
for trying to tell me

12:18.830 --> 12:20.697
that is
a Jamaican jerk chicken.

12:20.697 --> 12:22.497
I'm telling you--
you're trying to lecture me.

12:22.497 --> 12:23.763
I'm not trying
to lecture you.

12:23.763 --> 12:25.163
I wouldn't walk
into your hospital

12:25.163 --> 12:26.530
and attempt
to tell you your job.

12:26.530 --> 12:28.563
I am telling you.

12:28.563 --> 12:30.000
I don't know
what kind of herb

12:30.000 --> 12:30.030
I don't know
what kind of herb

12:30.030 --> 12:31.730
from Jamaica
you've been smoking,

12:31.730 --> 12:34.530
but that is
disgusting crap.

12:36.397 --> 12:37.397
Coming up...

12:37.397 --> 12:38.730
Why are you
so stubborn?

12:38.730 --> 12:40.197
Chef Ramsay takes on

12:40.197 --> 12:41.563
a doctor in denial.

12:41.563 --> 12:43.197
I'm not in denial.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.663
You don't understand
what I'm going through.

12:44.663 --> 12:45.830
And a kitchen

12:45.830 --> 12:48.397
That is ready
for emergency surgery.

12:48.397 --> 12:50.063
What's the addiction
to bags?

12:50.063 --> 12:51.730
Can Chef Ramsay

12:51.730 --> 12:52.730
bring this patient
back to life?

12:52.730 --> 12:54.597
I so want you to succeed!

12:54.597 --> 12:56.263
Not serving food like that
you don't!

12:57.863 --> 12:59.830
Or is Kingston Cafe
dead on arrival?

12:59.830 --> 13:00.000
You've lost
the plot.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.797
You've lost
the plot.

13:00.797 --> 13:01.797
I'm not crazy.

13:01.797 --> 13:03.763
I'm out of here.

13:03.763 --> 13:05.730
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

13:13.992 --> 13:16.292
Chef Ramsay came
to this Jamaican restaurant

13:16.292 --> 13:18.458
hoping to find food
rich in flavor.

13:18.458 --> 13:19.625
But instead it was...

13:19.625 --> 13:20.892
Bland as.

13:20.892 --> 13:22.458
Not surprisingly,

13:22.458 --> 13:24.325
He had a heated discussion
with the owner.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.225
Most jerk chicken
in Jamaica are dry.

13:26.225 --> 13:27.492
Let me tell you
something also.

13:27.492 --> 13:29.925
Let me finish...
Let me finish my sentence first.

13:29.925 --> 13:32.692
That is disgusting crap.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.358
Still with a bad taste
in his mouth,

13:34.358 --> 13:37.158
Chef Ramsay returns
to Kingston Cafe

13:37.158 --> 13:39.225
to see how it operates
in a dinner service.

13:39.225 --> 13:39.522
Where is the food,
um, served from?

13:39.522 --> 13:41.158
Where is the food,
um, served from?

13:41.158 --> 13:42.292
The window right there.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.225
That's
the window there?

13:43.225 --> 13:44.792
You're kidding me.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.292
We try to work
with what we got.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.558
Exactly.

13:50.558 --> 13:52.825
Stuffed jerk,
coconut rum shrimp.

13:52.825 --> 13:54.725
As the first orders
come into the kitchen...

13:54.725 --> 13:56.225
Okay, let's go, you guys.
Let's go.

13:56.225 --> 13:58.558
Kingston Cafe's
complimentary salads

13:58.558 --> 14:00.558
Get sent out
to the diners.

14:00.558 --> 14:02.358
First course,
comes with every meal.

14:04.192 --> 14:05.258
The salad I ordered,

14:05.258 --> 14:07.158
is it gonna be,
like, similar to this?

14:07.158 --> 14:08.525
It's gonna be
a little similar.

14:08.525 --> 14:09.522
It is?
Can I change my order?

14:09.522 --> 14:09.925
It is?
Can I change my order?

14:09.925 --> 14:11.125
Sure.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.625
What the  is that
in a martini glass?

14:13.625 --> 14:14.725
The salad.

14:14.725 --> 14:16.125
A salad?

14:16.125 --> 14:17.825
Daniel.
Yes?

14:17.825 --> 14:20.758
Who put the salad
in a martini glass?

14:22.225 --> 14:25.792
Is there a doctor
in the house?

14:25.792 --> 14:27.492
How many glasses?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.125
There's trays in the corner
there that they take.

14:29.125 --> 14:30.825
Oh, my God.

14:30.825 --> 14:32.158
You are kidding me.

14:32.158 --> 14:34.592
,.

14:34.592 --> 14:37.092
Who's doing all this?

14:37.092 --> 14:39.522
Oh, my good God.

14:39.522 --> 14:40.425
Oh, my good God.

14:40.425 --> 14:42.625
Um, Gordon,
if you continue like that,

14:42.625 --> 14:44.225
Jesus Christ
actually gonna appear.

14:44.225 --> 14:45.625
I hope so,
'cause I think

14:45.625 --> 14:46.858
that's what's needed
right now.

14:46.858 --> 14:48.992
Dressing a salad

14:48.992 --> 14:50.625
takes seconds.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.092
Tell me
what's wrong with that.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.392
They get soggy,
and it's nasty.
Thank you.

14:54.392 --> 14:56.192
Turn round
and tell the owner.

14:56.192 --> 14:58.958
It's soggy
and it's nasty.

14:58.958 --> 15:00.558
It doesn't mean
that it's really bad

15:00.558 --> 15:03.092
because he's never seen
something like this before.

15:03.092 --> 15:04.758
I want you to dress
this salad in a bowl.

15:04.758 --> 15:06.525
Okay.
Okay?

15:06.525 --> 15:09.092
Even though he was
just planning on observing,

15:09.092 --> 15:09.522
Chef Ramsay
can't control himself

15:09.522 --> 15:10.525
Chef Ramsay
can't control himself

15:10.525 --> 15:13.092
and institutes
his first change.

15:13.092 --> 15:14.758
We've got fresh salads
dressed to order

15:14.758 --> 15:16.258
and in a bowl--
Well done.

15:16.258 --> 15:17.325
Excellent.
Yeah.

15:17.325 --> 15:18.458
But Dr. Morris...

15:18.458 --> 15:20.025
Make sure it is warm.

15:20.025 --> 15:21.725
Is still the woman
in charge...

15:24.092 --> 15:27.158
Micromanaging whenever
and wherever possible.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.392
Is that warm?

15:29.692 --> 15:30.925
This is not Jamaican.

15:30.925 --> 15:32.125
There's no taste.

15:34.492 --> 15:35.658
You don't like this?

15:35.658 --> 15:36.692
Okay.

15:36.692 --> 15:38.892
They didn't like this.

15:38.892 --> 15:39.522
The two old people
right here.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.758
The two old people
right here.

15:44.592 --> 15:46.458
Dr. Morris
doesn't really like to hear

15:46.458 --> 15:48.192
a lot of complaints
about the food.

15:48.192 --> 15:51.258
She does what she knows
and wants to do.

15:52.858 --> 15:55.625
What is that there?

15:55.625 --> 15:57.325
Chicken breasts.

15:57.325 --> 15:58.192
Daniel?
Yes?

15:58.192 --> 15:59.225
When was that cooked?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.192
That was cooked
yesterday.

16:02.558 --> 16:04.258
Doctor?
Yes?

16:04.258 --> 16:06.025
I can't believe
you're doing this.

16:06.025 --> 16:07.725
That was cooked
last night.

16:07.725 --> 16:09.522
It looks
like a giraffe's tongue.

16:09.522 --> 16:09.625
It looks
like a giraffe's tongue.

16:09.625 --> 16:10.692
Okay.

16:10.692 --> 16:12.925
Makes me feel validated,
I guess,

16:12.925 --> 16:15.458
that the points
that I've been making for months

16:15.458 --> 16:16.992
are the points
that he's making now.

16:16.992 --> 16:18.425
Do you have
a dog at home?

16:18.425 --> 16:20.425
Don't feed them that.

16:20.425 --> 16:23.425
Keone, just
come over here.

16:23.425 --> 16:24.392
Okay.

16:24.392 --> 16:26.092
Now, Keone,

16:26.092 --> 16:28.325
he's really
getting me very upset.

16:28.325 --> 16:30.392
Suppose I punch him out?

16:30.392 --> 16:32.225
Because--
let me finish.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.292
He's right, mom.
Let me finish, Keone.

16:34.292 --> 16:35.425
Time-out, mom.

16:35.425 --> 16:36.825
Keone,
please be quiet.

16:36.825 --> 16:38.925
First of all, he want us
to cook everything fresh.

16:38.925 --> 16:39.522
Why can't you do that?
You can't!

16:39.522 --> 16:40.758
Why can't you do that?
You can't!

16:40.758 --> 16:42.125
Yes, you can.

16:42.125 --> 16:46.425
Jamaican food cannot
be cooked fresh every day.

16:46.425 --> 16:48.058
Do you understand that?

16:48.058 --> 16:49.125
Mom,

16:49.125 --> 16:51.925
we'll finish this later.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.458
What is that there?

16:55.458 --> 16:57.658
Oh, my God.

16:57.658 --> 16:59.658
You are kidding me.
Bags everywhere.

16:59.658 --> 17:01.658
Almighty.

17:01.658 --> 17:03.725
Oh, please.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.425
What's that
in the microwave?

17:07.425 --> 17:08.425
Rice.

17:08.425 --> 17:09.522
And when was that cooked?

17:09.522 --> 17:09.592
And when was that cooked?

17:09.592 --> 17:11.692
Four days ago?

17:11.692 --> 17:15.592
When I first worked here,
I was like, "Oh, no, really?

17:15.592 --> 17:17.092
Bags? Come on."

17:19.258 --> 17:20.692
What's the addiction
to bags?

17:20.692 --> 17:21.958
Is it a medical thing,

17:21.958 --> 17:23.492
like donating blood
in bags, or...?

17:23.492 --> 17:25.725
Everything you got
is, like, in bags.

17:25.725 --> 17:27.025
Where do you want
to put it then?

17:27.025 --> 17:28.458
If you're
now gonna tell me

17:28.458 --> 17:31.092
that rice stays better
in a bag inside the steamer,

17:31.092 --> 17:33.392
madam, I'm really sorry,

17:33.392 --> 17:34.825
but you've lost the plot.

17:37.158 --> 17:39.325
I don't like
when you disrespect me.

17:39.325 --> 17:39.522
So if you can tell me

17:39.522 --> 17:40.858
So if you can tell me

17:40.858 --> 17:42.258
Where you think
I've disrespected you.

17:42.258 --> 17:44.058
You told me
that I was crazy upstairs.

17:44.058 --> 17:46.425
I'll tell you why.

17:46.425 --> 17:48.592
The practices and how
you're running a restaurant

17:48.592 --> 17:49.958
is packed
with stupidity.

17:49.958 --> 17:52.258
I didn't say
that you are demented.

17:52.258 --> 17:53.925
Didn't say anything
like that at all.

17:53.925 --> 17:57.025
No, you specifically
say like this.

17:57.025 --> 17:58.225
That's what you
say to me.

17:58.225 --> 17:59.658
Right, do you hear
what I've said?

17:59.658 --> 18:00.758
Let me finish.

18:00.758 --> 18:02.625
If I say that to you,
how would you feel?

18:02.625 --> 18:04.225
I'm not a delicate,
dainty flower that's gonna

18:04.225 --> 18:05.292
take everything
you say personally.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.458
But let me tell you
something.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.125
The practices
are ludicrous.

18:09.125 --> 18:09.522
Can I just
show you something?

18:09.522 --> 18:12.058
Can I just
show you something?

18:12.058 --> 18:13.058
Ready?

18:13.058 --> 18:13.992
No answer.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.958
Just--just feel that.

18:15.958 --> 18:17.292
It's frozen.

18:17.292 --> 18:19.425
It can be--well, okay.

18:19.425 --> 18:20.792
Okay, I'm gonna argue.

18:20.792 --> 18:21.792
It should
not be frozen.

18:21.792 --> 18:22.725
Okay, well,
it is frozen.

18:22.725 --> 18:23.825
No, no, no...

18:23.825 --> 18:25.358
Now, don't tell me...
Okay, let me--

18:25.358 --> 18:27.658
no, I've got to finish
my sentence.

18:27.658 --> 18:31.458
Frozen solid, disgusting,
overcooked chicken.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.425
You're resisting it.
That's fine.

18:33.425 --> 18:34.792
No, I'm trying to say

18:34.792 --> 18:36.692
it should not be frozen
if they did it yesterday.

18:36.692 --> 18:37.825
Right, I understand.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.292
But I've just
told you it is.

18:39.292 --> 18:39.522
Right now,
you're running

18:39.522 --> 18:40.492
Right now,
you're running

18:40.492 --> 18:44.158
a hospital kitchen
full of bags.

18:44.158 --> 18:45.658
That.
I'm out of here.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.092
He may say I'm crazy,

18:48.092 --> 18:49.625
but certain things he says
about Jamaican food,

18:49.625 --> 18:50.958
I disagree with him.

18:50.958 --> 18:52.225
I'm not crazy.

18:52.225 --> 18:53.692
I think the doctor

18:53.692 --> 18:54.825
needs a doctor.

19:03.465 --> 19:06.298
Who put the salad
in a martini glass?

19:06.298 --> 19:08.498
After a very revealing
dinner service...

19:08.498 --> 19:10.632
You're running
a hospital kitchen

19:10.632 --> 19:12.198
full of bags.

19:12.198 --> 19:14.598
Chef Ramsay knows
that Kingston Cafe

19:14.598 --> 19:16.498
Will never overcome
its problems

19:16.498 --> 19:19.965
unless Dr. Morris realizes
she is causing the sickness,

19:19.965 --> 19:21.265
not the cure.

19:21.265 --> 19:24.032
So mission number one
this morning

19:24.032 --> 19:25.932
is a quick visit
the doctor's office,

19:25.932 --> 19:28.165
located right next door
the the restaurant.

19:28.165 --> 19:29.598
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.

19:29.598 --> 19:29.672
Do you mind if I come around?
Come on in.

19:29.672 --> 19:31.198
Do you mind if I come around?
Come on in.

19:31.198 --> 19:32.865
when Chef Ramsay
came to my office,

19:33.065 --> 19:34.632
I was surprised,

19:34.632 --> 19:37.432
because I did not expect
him to come back.

19:37.432 --> 19:40.165
Okay.
You're so smart.

19:40.165 --> 19:42.632
But you're unaware
of the dramatic change

19:42.632 --> 19:44.365
that is needed

19:44.365 --> 19:45.598
to reposition
this business.

19:45.598 --> 19:47.132
Why are you
so stubborn?

19:47.132 --> 19:49.198
I'm not stubborn.

19:50.298 --> 19:51.532
The practices

19:51.532 --> 19:54.132
you thought were correct
last night

19:54.132 --> 19:55.632
are backwards.

19:55.632 --> 19:57.798
You're in denial.

19:57.798 --> 19:59.672
Well, um,
I'm not in denial,

19:59.672 --> 20:00.098
Well, um,
I'm not in denial,

20:00.098 --> 20:02.198
because...I'm not
in denial.

20:02.198 --> 20:03.432
I'm not here
to fight you.

20:03.432 --> 20:05.032
I'm here to help you.

20:05.032 --> 20:06.365
Okay...

20:06.365 --> 20:08.665
Just help me understand
where you are financially.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.198
What have you put

20:10.198 --> 20:12.132
into that restaurant
in the last three years?

20:12.132 --> 20:14.565
Probably over $300,000.

20:14.565 --> 20:16.765
You know, I've just
been using my credit card.

20:16.765 --> 20:18.132
I borrowed money

20:18.132 --> 20:19.565
to just--

20:19.565 --> 20:20.832
to maintain
the restaurant.

20:20.832 --> 20:22.332
So how much longer
can you continue

20:22.332 --> 20:23.398
along these lines?

20:23.398 --> 20:25.465
Probably a month.

20:25.465 --> 20:28.598
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna quit.

20:28.598 --> 20:29.672
Well, you may not
have a choice.

20:29.672 --> 20:30.532
Well, you may not
have a choice.

20:30.532 --> 20:31.565
Does your team,
does your son,

20:31.565 --> 20:33.165
does your management
understand?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.698
My son doesn't tell you
the honest truth.

20:35.698 --> 20:37.632
My son,
he's only telling you

20:37.632 --> 20:39.032
what he thinks
you want to hear.

20:39.032 --> 20:40.465
Well, I appreciate
you telling me.

20:40.465 --> 20:42.698
He doesn't tell you
that he's not dependable

20:42.698 --> 20:43.865
and doesn't show up.

20:43.865 --> 20:44.898
Really?

20:44.898 --> 20:45.965
No, he doesn't.

20:45.965 --> 20:47.165
You don't understand.

20:47.165 --> 20:48.798
Well, I won't understand
unless you tell me.

20:48.798 --> 20:50.298
You don't understand
what I'm going through.

20:50.298 --> 20:51.498
You ask him
to do anything,

20:51.498 --> 20:52.732
he argues.

20:52.732 --> 20:55.432
If I say "A,"
he argues about "B."

20:55.432 --> 20:57.032
Do you know
how I'm hurt

20:57.032 --> 20:58.865
that I have my kids

20:58.865 --> 20:59.672
who I have sacrificed
my life for,

20:59.672 --> 21:02.065
who I have sacrificed
my life for,

21:02.065 --> 21:04.032
and...

21:04.032 --> 21:05.465
They don't
follow through on things

21:05.465 --> 21:06.832
that they need to do,

21:06.832 --> 21:10.432
and I have to be
doing everything?

21:10.432 --> 21:12.265
Well, this is
a huge amount of pressure

21:12.265 --> 21:14.932
on one pair
of shoulders.

21:14.932 --> 21:17.232
Isn't Keone
worried about you

21:17.232 --> 21:18.732
in terms of...
I don't think he does.

21:18.732 --> 21:20.732
I think the servers
worry about me

21:20.732 --> 21:21.898
more than my son does.

21:23.232 --> 21:25.632
And you know,
it hurts me

21:25.632 --> 21:29.672
because my mom died
when I was ten.

21:29.672 --> 21:29.965
because my mom died
when I was ten.

21:32.265 --> 21:37.098
And I didn't have a mom
when I grew up.

21:37.098 --> 21:39.965
And I just grew up
and be determined

21:39.965 --> 21:41.632
to be somebody
when I grew up.

21:41.632 --> 21:42.898
And you are.

21:42.898 --> 21:45.365
You did it,
and you accomplished it.

21:47.898 --> 21:49.865
Former Olympian,

21:49.865 --> 21:51.898
radiologist, doctor.

21:51.898 --> 21:53.265
Come on.

21:53.265 --> 21:57.065
Don't let the negativity
in the restaurant

21:57.065 --> 21:59.672
destroy
your self-esteem.

21:59.672 --> 22:02.165
destroy
your self-esteem.

22:02.165 --> 22:03.865
No wonder

22:03.865 --> 22:05.298
you're agitated.

22:05.298 --> 22:07.865
No wonder
you're deeply concerned.

22:07.865 --> 22:11.665
The pressure on
your shoulders is ridiculous.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.398
And you've done everything
before this restaurant

22:14.398 --> 22:15.798
right in your life.

22:15.798 --> 22:18.098
You've got every right
to continue

22:18.098 --> 22:19.498
with that self-esteem.

22:19.498 --> 22:21.698
And you're
not gonna be dragged down

22:21.698 --> 22:23.498
by that restaurant.

22:24.732 --> 22:27.098
This may be the first time
in your life, doctor,

22:27.098 --> 22:28.165
that you need help,

22:28.165 --> 22:29.672
and I'm here
to do that for you, okay?

22:29.672 --> 22:31.265
and I'm here
to do that for you, okay?

22:31.265 --> 22:33.232
I appreciate that.

22:33.232 --> 22:36.498
Let's not clash.
I'm here to help.

22:36.498 --> 22:38.198
Okay.
Okay?

22:38.198 --> 22:39.532
I appreciate that.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.432
Good.
And I'm sorry.

22:41.432 --> 22:42.398
I appreciate
your honesty.

22:42.398 --> 22:43.432
And don't be sorry.

22:43.432 --> 22:44.865
Come on. Come here.

22:44.865 --> 22:46.832
Come here.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.098
Come on.

22:49.931 --> 22:51.298
I really feel like

22:51.298 --> 22:53.298
I can trust him now,

22:53.298 --> 22:54.731
and that really means
a lot to me.

22:54.731 --> 22:57.498
'Cause I'm not used to...

22:57.498 --> 22:59.165
asking for help.

23:04.231 --> 23:05.365
Una's in pain.

23:05.365 --> 23:06.698
She's desperate,
and she's got

23:06.698 --> 23:08.331
so much riding
on her shoulders.

23:08.331 --> 23:09.765
The big question for me is,

23:09.765 --> 23:12.631
how committed is her son
to helping his mum?

23:17.198 --> 23:18.631
Keone?
Yeah?

23:18.631 --> 23:19.731
Want to get
straight to the point.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.831
What do you want
out of this restaurant?

23:21.831 --> 23:23.364
And how much
are you committed

23:23.364 --> 23:25.231
to helping it
turn around?

23:25.231 --> 23:26.798
If you would have met me

23:26.798 --> 23:28.098
when the restaurant
first opened,

23:28.098 --> 23:29.631
it would have been
a completely different vibe.

23:29.631 --> 23:29.672
In what way?

23:29.672 --> 23:31.331
In what way?

23:31.331 --> 23:32.964
I mean, like, I was really
passionate about this thing.

23:32.964 --> 23:33.931
I really was.

23:33.931 --> 23:35.298
I was like, "Look, Mom,

23:35.298 --> 23:36.431
this is a viable business,"

23:36.431 --> 23:37.731
and I pushed so hard
for it,

23:37.731 --> 23:40.564
and I wanted her to see
that I was right,

23:40.564 --> 23:41.964
but she doesn't want
to approach the business

23:41.964 --> 23:43.298
in a way
that'll make it work.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.964
You seem to be in competition
with your mother.

23:45.964 --> 23:48.964
It's...It's the nature
of our relationship.

23:48.964 --> 23:50.231
Are you aware
of the financial mess

23:50.231 --> 23:51.264
that your mother's in?

23:51.264 --> 23:52.964
She won't tell me.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.331
This place
is days away

23:54.331 --> 23:57.331
from closing.

23:57.331 --> 23:59.672
She has horrendous
credit card bills.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.631
She has horrendous
credit card bills.

24:00.631 --> 24:01.964
Right.

24:01.964 --> 24:03.098
Her retirement's
in jeopardy.

24:05.798 --> 24:07.264
And let me tell you
something.

24:07.264 --> 24:08.998
The most important lady
in my life

24:08.998 --> 24:10.064
is my mother.

24:10.064 --> 24:11.164
Right.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.698
And what she's
done for me

24:12.698 --> 24:13.998
has been extraordinary.

24:13.998 --> 24:15.098
Hasn't your mum

24:15.098 --> 24:16.131
done more

24:16.131 --> 24:17.331
that you could
ever imagine?

24:17.331 --> 24:18.431
Absolutely.

24:18.431 --> 24:19.498
And that's
coming from a lady

24:19.498 --> 24:21.598
that had no mum.

24:21.598 --> 24:22.798
So drop the bravado

24:22.798 --> 24:25.298
and focus
on your family,

24:25.298 --> 24:27.364
because if this restaurant
goes down,

24:27.364 --> 24:28.964
you're going down
with it.

24:28.964 --> 24:29.672
Got it?

24:29.672 --> 24:30.098
Got it?

24:30.098 --> 24:31.798
All right.

24:31.798 --> 24:33.098
Thank you.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.964
He's definitely right,

24:34.964 --> 24:36.464
And I know
that she needs help.

24:36.464 --> 24:38.031
Love my mother to death,

24:38.031 --> 24:39.131
and I'm not leaving,
you know,

24:39.131 --> 24:40.131
her to handle this
by herself.

24:42.131 --> 24:44.031
After important
breakthrough conversations

24:44.031 --> 24:45.998
with Una and Keone...

24:45.998 --> 24:47.664
Oh, my gosh.

24:47.664 --> 24:48.798
Chef Ramsay looks

24:48.798 --> 24:50.464
To energize the restaurant

24:50.464 --> 24:52.131
and improve the quality
of the food.

24:52.131 --> 24:54.198
So tonight's dinner service
will feature

24:54.198 --> 24:56.964
a barbecue on the patio
with Keone at the helm.

24:56.964 --> 24:58.064
That's what
you'll be wearing later.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.398
Don't dirty it.
All right.

24:59.398 --> 24:59.672
I want everyone
in the neighborhood

24:59.672 --> 25:00.631
I want everyone
in the neighborhood

25:00.631 --> 25:01.898
lifting their windows
up and, "Mmm!

25:01.898 --> 25:02.964
"Wow.

25:02.964 --> 25:04.531
Where's that smell
coming from?"

25:04.531 --> 25:07.398
By running a delicious
barbecue outside,

25:07.398 --> 25:09.731
Chef Ramsay wants Una
to realize

25:09.731 --> 25:10.731
the merits of serving
Jamaican food

25:10.731 --> 25:12.398
that is not only
completely fresh,

25:12.398 --> 25:13.798
but rich in flavor.

25:13.798 --> 25:15.231
So the restaurant's
running in the restaurant,

25:15.231 --> 25:17.631
and the barbecue's
taking place on the patio.

25:17.631 --> 25:19.331
Any questions?

25:19.331 --> 25:20.731
Okay, jump in.
Have a little taste.

25:20.731 --> 25:22.164
Wow, that is amazing,

25:22.164 --> 25:23.231
It smells good out here.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.331
The chicken is good.

25:24.331 --> 25:25.564
That means a lot
coming from you.

25:26.831 --> 25:27.964
I like the chicken.

25:27.964 --> 25:29.672
It's different,
but it was good.

25:29.672 --> 25:29.998
It's different,
but it was good.

25:29.998 --> 25:31.498
I would give him
a "B"-plus.

25:31.498 --> 25:33.464
But I'm worried
because people come in

25:33.464 --> 25:35.298
like the other one also,

25:35.298 --> 25:37.531
so you don't want
to change too much.

25:37.531 --> 25:38.864
Okay, excited?

25:38.864 --> 25:39.964
Yep.
Yes?

25:39.964 --> 25:41.131
Good, let's go,

25:41.131 --> 25:42.931
'cause we're open
in half an hour.

25:42.931 --> 25:44.398
Coming up...

25:44.398 --> 25:45.931
Will the new barbecue
be the answer

25:45.931 --> 25:47.164
to Kingston Cafe's
problems?

25:48.764 --> 25:50.798
Will the kitchen survive
dinner service?

25:50.798 --> 25:52.331
I so want you
to succeed!

25:52.331 --> 25:54.531
Not serving food
like that you don't!

25:55.598 --> 25:57.198
And can a mother and son

25:57.198 --> 25:58.598
find a way
to work together?

25:58.598 --> 25:59.672
You like to argue too much.
This isn't an argument.

25:59.672 --> 26:00.564
You like to argue too much.
This isn't an argument.

26:00.564 --> 26:01.864
These questions all
get answered...

26:01.864 --> 26:03.298
Oh, gosh.

26:03.298 --> 26:04.898
When Kitchen Nightmares
continues.

26:10.516 --> 26:12.550
As the doors open for dinner,

26:12.550 --> 26:14.816
customers are offered the
regular menu in the dining room.

26:14.816 --> 26:16.016
All right.

26:16.016 --> 26:17.583
Or the special barbecue menu

26:17.583 --> 26:18.583
served on the patio.

26:18.583 --> 26:19.716
At any time
you can just go up

26:19.716 --> 26:20.783
and start
serving yourself.

26:20.783 --> 26:22.350
Roasted corn
with chili lime butter.

26:22.350 --> 26:23.716
The colors and the smells,

26:23.716 --> 26:25.283
everything was vibrant
and exciting.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.416
That looks so good.

26:26.416 --> 26:27.650
It's pretty phenomenal.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.316
It's a really good
idea, though.

26:29.316 --> 26:31.350
While Keone oversees
the barbecue,

26:31.350 --> 26:32.883
Which is already
generating excitement...

26:32.883 --> 26:34.216
I need shrimp.

26:34.216 --> 26:36.350
They're defrosting right now.

26:36.350 --> 26:36.732
Head chef Daniel
and the kitchen staff

26:36.732 --> 26:38.316
Head chef Daniel
and the kitchen staff

26:38.316 --> 26:40.916
Are unfortunately stuck
in their same old habits.

26:40.916 --> 26:42.450
What in the
is that?

26:42.450 --> 26:44.783
Cups and bags,
cups and bags.

26:44.783 --> 26:46.350
I thought the only thing that
went in bags were bodies.

26:46.350 --> 26:48.016
I hate those bags.

26:48.016 --> 26:50.083
Uh!
Ugh, gross.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.950
So where's the fresh
rice for tonight?

26:51.950 --> 26:53.650
We're using the same rice
that we made yesterday.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.883
The doctor's call.
Oh, no.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.750
I'm extremely frustrated.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.683
I wanted to make
fresh beans and rice today.

27:00.683 --> 27:03.816
It was not the decision
Dr. Morris wanted to make.

27:03.816 --> 27:05.183
Got no fresh
rice on there.

27:05.183 --> 27:06.732
Apparently,
doctor's orders are

27:06.732 --> 27:06.883
Apparently,
doctor's orders are

27:06.883 --> 27:08.416
use the old rice
in the bag.

27:08.416 --> 27:09.516
I'm sorry.

27:09.516 --> 27:10.550
Ohh!

27:10.550 --> 27:12.916
I hope they get
our food out soon.

27:12.916 --> 27:15.150
In spite of the frequent use
of the microwave...

27:15.150 --> 27:17.483
Guys, it's been
20 minutes

27:17.483 --> 27:18.550
on and order
of ruddie shrimp.

27:18.550 --> 27:20.383
We're just waiting
for it.

27:20.383 --> 27:21.850
The kitchen struggles

27:21.850 --> 27:23.250
To get food out
to their customers.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.250
I could have
grown a beard

27:24.250 --> 27:26.083
by the time they
bring my meal.

27:26.083 --> 27:28.216
In the dining room,
the atmosphere

27:28.216 --> 27:29.750
was a little, like, down

27:29.750 --> 27:31.083
where the food
kept taking so long.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.616
The people just weren't
generally happy.

27:33.616 --> 27:34.916
Whereas when
I poked my head outside

27:34.916 --> 27:36.583
to the patio

27:36.583 --> 27:36.732
people were laughing,
they were having fun.

27:36.732 --> 27:38.483
people were laughing,
they were having fun.

27:38.483 --> 27:40.083
It was almost like two
different restaurants tonight.

27:40.083 --> 27:41.450
That is good.

27:41.450 --> 27:43.383
That was
really good chicken.

27:43.383 --> 27:44.983
Keone, great news.

27:44.983 --> 27:46.450
Look how popular
the barbecue's going.

27:46.450 --> 27:47.450
Right.
And that smell.

27:47.450 --> 27:48.850
Mmm! Nice.

27:48.850 --> 27:50.916
Makes you feel like you're
back in Jamaica, huh?

27:50.916 --> 27:52.850
From Jamaica
to depressing.

27:52.850 --> 27:55.183
After what seemed
like an eternity,

27:55.183 --> 27:56.850
customers in the dining room

27:56.850 --> 27:58.116
are finally
receiving their food.

27:58.116 --> 27:59.450
Um, this is...

27:59.450 --> 28:01.083
Ah.

28:01.083 --> 28:02.983
But it doesn't appear
to be worth the wait.

28:06.183 --> 28:06.732
Overcooked?

28:06.732 --> 28:07.349
Overcooked?

28:07.349 --> 28:09.283
Okay, I'll let them
know right now.

28:09.283 --> 28:10.516
What's wrong with that?

28:10.516 --> 28:12.083
They said it's
too dry and overcooked.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.383
It's just gone out.
Daniel?

28:13.383 --> 28:14.416
What?

28:14.416 --> 28:16.149
She just wants to try
something else.

28:16.149 --> 28:17.716
Recommend the barbecue.

28:17.716 --> 28:19.216
We got a stunning piece
of salmon out there

28:19.216 --> 28:20.816
cooked perfectly.
go get it quickly.

28:20.816 --> 28:22.549
Dry and overcooked?
Is that still--

28:22.549 --> 28:23.916
is that
the frozen stuff?

28:23.916 --> 28:25.349
Yes, that's
the frozen stuff.

28:25.349 --> 28:26.749
Rubbery.

28:26.749 --> 28:28.583
She's absolutely right.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.749
Thoroughly frustrated,

28:29.749 --> 28:31.749
Chef Ramsay
jumps into action

28:31.749 --> 28:34.983
and puts together
an entree of barbecue salmon.

28:34.983 --> 28:36.349
Let's hope she enjoys.

28:36.349 --> 28:36.732
Can't believe
we're serving barbecued food

28:36.732 --> 28:37.683
Can't believe
we're serving barbecued food

28:37.683 --> 28:38.816
in the dining room.

28:38.816 --> 28:40.183
Here we are.

28:40.183 --> 28:41.649
Chef Ramsay
plated it for you.

28:41.649 --> 28:42.916
Oh, my God.

28:42.916 --> 28:44.149
There you are.
Thank you.

28:44.149 --> 28:46.383
You're welcome.

28:46.383 --> 28:48.783
Oh, my God.

28:48.783 --> 28:50.283
That's so good.

28:50.283 --> 28:51.916
Excuse me, how is that?

28:51.916 --> 28:53.383
Great.
Is it great?

28:53.383 --> 28:55.349
It's the barbecue?
Oh, my God.

28:55.349 --> 28:56.683
Next time, patio.

28:56.683 --> 28:59.049
Yeah.
Enjoy.

28:59.049 --> 29:00.049
Una?

29:00.049 --> 29:01.316
Please?

29:01.316 --> 29:02.516
The smell.

29:02.516 --> 29:03.983
Fresh barbecue.

29:03.983 --> 29:06.116
And the buzz out here
is wonderful.

29:06.116 --> 29:06.732
it's beautiful.

29:06.732 --> 29:07.349
it's beautiful.

29:07.349 --> 29:08.349
I really appreciate it.

29:08.349 --> 29:09.383
Good.
Thank you.

29:09.383 --> 29:11.416
Change is not easy,
you know.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.149
But I was really impressed

29:13.149 --> 29:16.016
with how many people
enjoyed the barbecue tonight,

29:16.016 --> 29:18.249
so I'm willing
to allow him to

29:18.249 --> 29:20.149
tell me
how I can make it better.

29:24.116 --> 29:26.016
Okay.

29:26.016 --> 29:28.583
Tonight was a tale
of two restaurants.

29:28.583 --> 29:29.949
Una, let's hear
from the boss.

29:29.949 --> 29:31.483
Everybody
out in the patio

29:31.483 --> 29:33.016
were very pleased.

29:33.016 --> 29:34.683
Inside,
that was different.

29:34.683 --> 29:36.732
Inside, everything was bad.

29:36.732 --> 29:36.983
Inside, everything was bad.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.849
Yeah, you're right.

29:38.849 --> 29:40.483
We did confirm
the barbecue worked.

29:40.483 --> 29:41.549
Clearly.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.816
Tonight,
we're adding something,

29:43.816 --> 29:45.216
but we might have
to take something away,

29:45.216 --> 29:47.049
because
it's been bugging me

29:47.049 --> 29:50.316
from the first minute
I walked in here.

29:50.316 --> 29:51.616
Hang on a second,
yes?

29:51.616 --> 29:52.683
Irritating.

29:52.683 --> 29:54.383
Bloody hell.

29:54.383 --> 29:56.383
What is it?
Does anybody know?

29:56.383 --> 29:57.516
What could it be?

30:00.783 --> 30:02.549
What the
is going on?

30:04.416 --> 30:05.483
Oh, gosh.

30:15.790 --> 30:17.423
Fed up with the amount of food

30:17.423 --> 30:18.723
that is being reheated...

30:18.723 --> 30:20.156
Oh, my God.

30:20.156 --> 30:21.556
You are kidding me.

30:21.556 --> 30:22.756
Chef Ramsay...

30:22.756 --> 30:23.856
I have to take
something away.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.090
Hang on a second,
dear.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.690
Is determined

30:26.690 --> 30:30.690
to get rid
of this damaging practice.

30:34.456 --> 30:37.523
There's
more plastic here

30:37.523 --> 30:38.690
than in Beverly Hills.

30:40.523 --> 30:40.809
Say good-bye
to your bags.

30:40.809 --> 30:42.623
Say good-bye
to your bags.

30:48.223 --> 30:50.056
Looking at all that food,

30:50.056 --> 30:52.590
the first thing
that comes to me was dollars.

30:52.590 --> 30:54.223
Una?
Yes?

30:54.223 --> 30:56.490
I want you

30:56.490 --> 30:58.023
to succeed.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.690
Tonight,
it stops.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.656
We get rid
of the bags,

31:01.656 --> 31:02.623
we have
a simple practice

31:02.623 --> 31:05.056
of cooking
raw ingredients

31:05.056 --> 31:06.423
on the day
and serving them.

31:06.423 --> 31:08.856
Trust me.

31:08.856 --> 31:10.809
If we don't make
major changes

31:10.809 --> 31:12.156
If we don't make
major changes

31:12.156 --> 31:15.690
on relaunching
this restaurant,

31:15.690 --> 31:17.123
we don't stand
a hope in hell.

31:19.690 --> 31:21.156
Good night.

31:21.156 --> 31:22.123
See you
in the morning.

31:22.123 --> 31:24.056
Good night..

31:26.523 --> 31:28.723
It was kind of hard
to take.

31:28.723 --> 31:30.990
I think it's really
gonna work out, Dr. Morris.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.990
but he wants me to trust him,

31:32.990 --> 31:34.890
so I'm gonna do that.

31:34.890 --> 31:38.623
With Dr. Morris
seemingly onboard,

31:38.623 --> 31:39.923
Chef Ramsay and his team

31:39.923 --> 31:40.809
spend the next
nine overnight hours

31:40.809 --> 31:41.656
spend the next
nine overnight hours

31:41.656 --> 31:43.856
bringing
the Caribbean spirit

31:43.856 --> 31:45.390
into Kingston Cafe.

31:45.390 --> 31:46.623
Good morning.

31:46.623 --> 31:47.756
Good morning.

31:47.756 --> 31:49.723
Here,
on this very patio,

31:49.723 --> 31:51.490
we had a taste
of success, right?

31:51.490 --> 31:52.590
Yep.

31:52.590 --> 31:54.056
Now the idea is to
get that success

31:54.056 --> 31:55.156
in through there.

31:56.290 --> 31:57.356
Ready?
Yeah.

31:57.356 --> 31:58.923
Let's go.

31:58.923 --> 31:59.856
In we go,
straight through.

31:59.856 --> 32:02.123
Oh, my gosh!

32:02.123 --> 32:04.190
Whoa!

32:04.190 --> 32:05.956
Oh, my gosh!
Jump in, jump in, jump in.

32:05.956 --> 32:07.190
Wow.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.190
holy Toledo.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.690
Will you look at that?

32:09.690 --> 32:10.809
Una, how do you feel?

32:10.809 --> 32:10.990
Una, how do you feel?

32:10.990 --> 32:12.323
This is fantastic.

32:12.323 --> 32:15.790
Chef Ramsay transformed
this entire room

32:15.790 --> 32:18.290
into the Caribbean.

32:18.290 --> 32:20.523
Let's start
with the Caribbean blue.

32:20.523 --> 32:22.256
We removed the artwork
from the walls

32:22.256 --> 32:24.956
and got that cabana effect,
that Caribbean feel, yes?

32:24.956 --> 32:27.156
Oh, my God.

32:27.156 --> 32:28.790
I feel like I'm at the beach.

32:28.790 --> 32:30.123
All I need now is
a nice cocktail in my hand,

32:30.123 --> 32:31.090
and it would
be a great day.

32:31.090 --> 32:32.256
Oh, my God.

32:32.256 --> 32:35.190
Una, if you say "Oh, my God"
any more times,

32:35.190 --> 32:36.356
trust me,
he will appear.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.190
That's the first thing
you said to me when I arrived.

32:39.190 --> 32:40.390
Good God!

32:40.390 --> 32:40.809
If you continue
like that,

32:40.809 --> 32:41.690
If you continue
like that,

32:41.690 --> 32:43.856
Jesus Christ
actually gonna appear.

32:43.856 --> 32:46.556
Oh, my God.

32:46.556 --> 32:47.723
Have a look at the tabletops.

32:47.723 --> 32:49.590
Gone is that white linen.

32:49.590 --> 32:56.156
It's a casual, exciting,
fun, inviting dining room.

32:56.156 --> 32:58.590
We've got some really
nice woven steel placemats

32:58.590 --> 33:00.590
and beautiful China.

33:00.590 --> 33:02.223
And look what was
on every table.

33:02.223 --> 33:03.323
Yoo-hoo!

33:03.323 --> 33:05.390
It's Jamaican jerk sauce.

33:05.390 --> 33:06.556
That's brilliant.

33:06.556 --> 33:08.256
Oh, I'm so happy.

33:08.256 --> 33:09.523
Wow, good.

33:09.523 --> 33:10.809
I know it.
Oh, thank you.

33:10.809 --> 33:11.190
I know it.
Oh, thank you.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.256
It's pretty phenomenal.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.490
Completely happy
for my mother.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.490
That's the biggest thing.

33:19.723 --> 33:21.190
Along with the new decor,

33:21.190 --> 33:22.590
Chef Ramsay
has has replaced

33:22.590 --> 33:24.956
the tasteless,
uninspiring old menu

33:24.956 --> 33:27.890
and in its place
a tasty, fresh menu

33:27.890 --> 33:30.423
that celebrates
Caribbean cuisine.

33:30.423 --> 33:33.090
Please take a look
at the Kingston Cafe.

33:33.090 --> 33:34.956
New dishes.

33:34.956 --> 33:36.623
That is so beautiful.

33:36.623 --> 33:39.023
Just have a look at the vibrant
colors, first off.

33:39.023 --> 33:40.590
Yes. It's real beautiful.

33:40.590 --> 33:40.809
More importantly, it's fresh.

33:40.809 --> 33:42.223
More importantly, it's fresh.

33:42.223 --> 33:43.456
"A taste of Jamaican platter,"

33:43.456 --> 33:45.423
so everything on there
you could wish for

33:45.423 --> 33:47.690
in a Jamaican restaurant,
yeah?

33:47.690 --> 33:48.723
The patties are phenomenal.

33:48.723 --> 33:50.723
The Kingston special barbecue,

33:50.723 --> 33:51.923
that'll be done from outside.

33:51.923 --> 33:54.756
Barbecue chicken, kingfish,

33:54.756 --> 33:56.590
and a tamarind marinated
skirt steak.

33:56.590 --> 33:58.590
That's beautiful.
It looks good, right?

33:58.590 --> 33:59.590
Yeah.

33:59.590 --> 34:01.590
So you can look good...

34:01.590 --> 34:02.756
Because we have
a little fun

34:02.756 --> 34:03.990
with these!

34:03.990 --> 34:05.190
Beautiful!

34:05.190 --> 34:06.890
Yes!

34:06.890 --> 34:09.090
Yes? Look at that.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.809
Oh!

34:10.809 --> 34:11.623
Oh!

34:11.623 --> 34:12.923
And Matt...

34:12.923 --> 34:15.490
When you sweat in black,
we won't see it!

34:15.490 --> 34:16.556
Thank you!

34:16.556 --> 34:17.690
Yes?
Yes.

34:17.690 --> 34:19.623
Now hold that.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.556
Pass them along.
Your name's in there.

34:21.556 --> 34:23.256
This shirt's definitely
a more casual feel

34:23.256 --> 34:25.323
Than the white shirt and tie,

34:25.323 --> 34:26.523
and I really think
this has gotta go.

34:26.523 --> 34:27.723
Start tasting.

34:29.423 --> 34:31.290
That fish is perfect.
Uh-huh.

34:31.290 --> 34:33.156
It really is.

34:33.156 --> 34:34.523
This is the best
Jamaican food I've ever had.

34:34.523 --> 34:35.956
This is actually probably
the best food full stop

34:35.956 --> 34:37.056
I've ever had.

34:37.056 --> 34:39.590
I love it.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

34:39.590 --> 34:40.809
Chef Ramsay has opened

34:40.809 --> 34:41.223
Chef Ramsay has opened

34:41.223 --> 34:43.390
so many avenues for me

34:43.390 --> 34:45.990
that I could never, ever
repay him for his kindness.

34:45.990 --> 34:47.623
One more little surprise.

34:47.623 --> 34:49.290
Come through.

34:49.290 --> 34:50.890
When I first arrived,
driving by,

34:50.890 --> 34:52.623
I missed the place.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.123
It wasn't clear enough.

34:55.723 --> 34:59.156
Time to make a statement
to Pasadena.

34:59.156 --> 35:00.456
Ready?

35:01.656 --> 35:04.123
Oh!
Yeah!

35:04.123 --> 35:06.090
Look at that!

35:06.090 --> 35:09.156
Wow! You can see it
from miles away.

35:09.156 --> 35:10.090
Yes, that's true.

35:10.090 --> 35:10.809
Okay?

35:10.809 --> 35:11.623
Okay?

35:11.623 --> 35:12.623
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

35:14.356 --> 35:16.656
seeing a new sign
that was so visible

35:16.656 --> 35:18.290
and colorful.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.556
Thank you.

35:19.556 --> 35:21.723
I appreciate it
so much.

35:21.723 --> 35:23.856
Now there's no way that anybody
cannot see the sign.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.956
Let's make this service...

35:25.956 --> 35:27.589
An amazing service, yes?

35:29.222 --> 35:30.989
With Chef Ramsay's vision
complete,

35:30.989 --> 35:33.822
it's time to relaunch
this Pasadena restaurant.

35:33.822 --> 35:36.056
How are you guys
today?
Good.

35:36.056 --> 35:39.356
Welcome to the new
and improved Kingston Cafe.

35:39.356 --> 35:40.809
As you can see,
we've got the new menus down.

35:40.809 --> 35:41.289
As you can see,
we've got the new menus down.

35:41.289 --> 35:42.556
I'll go with the jerk
chicken, the barbecue.

35:42.556 --> 35:43.956
We're gonna do
a taste of Jamaica.

35:43.956 --> 35:45.222
Here we go.

35:45.222 --> 35:47.522
All right, you guys,
we got a tasty Jamaican platter,

35:47.522 --> 35:48.956
barbecued jerk chicken,

35:48.956 --> 35:50.589
barbecued
tamarind skirt steak.

35:50.589 --> 35:52.256
May I have some
chips, please?

35:52.256 --> 35:54.189
Only minutes into
dinner service...

35:54.189 --> 35:56.122
Imani,
appetizer platter.

35:56.122 --> 35:58.956
Appetizers are leaving
the kitchen at a steady pace.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.389
Tuna ceviche
and lobster fritters

36:01.389 --> 36:03.056
are gonna come.
it's really good.

36:03.056 --> 36:05.056
And more importantly,

36:05.056 --> 36:07.922
customers are thrilled
with what they are receiving.

36:07.922 --> 36:09.456
That is so good,
isn't it?

36:09.456 --> 36:10.809
But the real pressure's
about to hit.

36:10.809 --> 36:10.889
But the real pressure's
about to hit.

36:10.889 --> 36:12.122
Getting backed up
on tickets.

36:12.122 --> 36:14.189
,.

36:14.189 --> 36:16.856
Head chef Daniel is already
a little flustered.

36:16.856 --> 36:17.956
Come on, guys.

36:17.956 --> 36:19.556
K-13.

36:19.556 --> 36:20.922
K-13?

36:20.922 --> 36:22.756
They already got
their food.

36:22.756 --> 36:24.456
K-13 already got their food.

36:24.456 --> 36:26.889
Oh, no!

36:26.889 --> 36:28.389
K-13 has already
had their food.

36:28.389 --> 36:30.089
Why are we sending food
twice?

36:30.089 --> 36:31.556
Who's organizing this?
It is me.

36:31.556 --> 36:34.522
I need one person
to start taking control.

36:34.522 --> 36:36.656
Yes, Chef.
I beg you.

36:36.656 --> 36:39.022
What table's going
next, please?
Platters for P-4.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.456
So P-4. Good.

36:40.456 --> 36:40.809
Let's all sing
off the same page...
Yes.

36:40.809 --> 36:43.156
Let's all sing
off the same page...
Yes.

36:43.156 --> 36:44.756
And we send P-4 together.

36:44.756 --> 36:46.156
I was mixing up some orders,

36:46.156 --> 36:48.256
sending things
to the wrong tables,

36:48.256 --> 36:49.522
and that's unexcusable.

36:49.522 --> 36:51.689
Let's do
the red snapper.
I've got that.

36:51.689 --> 36:54.456
Here.
You have the red snapper?

36:55.656 --> 36:58.122
Oh, no!

36:58.122 --> 36:59.922
It's black as hell!

36:59.922 --> 37:01.456
Why?
It overcooked.
Sorry, chef.

37:01.456 --> 37:02.722
No, no, look at me!

37:02.722 --> 37:05.422
Just tell me why
so I can help you.

37:05.422 --> 37:07.956
I so want you to succeed.
So do I, Chef.

37:07.956 --> 37:09.956
Not serving food like that,
you don't!

37:20.058 --> 37:21.324
It's relaunch night

37:21.324 --> 37:22.624
at the Kingston Cafe.

37:22.624 --> 37:24.791
And after a promising start,

37:24.791 --> 37:26.424
Oh, no!

37:26.424 --> 37:28.491
Head chef Daniel
has lost his composure...

37:28.491 --> 37:30.424
,.

37:30.424 --> 37:33.091
And his standards.
It's black as hell!

37:33.091 --> 37:35.591
Things just weren't going
the way we thought they would.

37:35.591 --> 37:36.958
It overcooked.

37:36.958 --> 37:38.458
And you gave it
to the girl to send!

37:38.458 --> 37:40.658
Let me redo it.

37:42.891 --> 37:46.091
That table over there--
they were seated after us,

37:46.091 --> 37:46.868
and they've already eaten.

37:46.868 --> 37:48.058
and they've already eaten.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.091
The food wasn't coming out
on time,

37:49.091 --> 37:51.091
and it made us look bad.

37:51.091 --> 37:52.224
It was going downhill fast.

37:52.224 --> 37:53.524
Guys, I'm sorry
about this, guys.

37:53.524 --> 37:55.624
I can assure you,
it's comin' out.

37:55.624 --> 37:56.824
okay, Keone, what about

37:56.824 --> 37:57.958
the people who've been here
for an hour?

37:57.958 --> 37:59.058
Mom, what can we do?

38:00.691 --> 38:03.324
Just two seconds. Look.
Two seconds. Come here.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.024
I need someone
gettin' a grip of this now

38:05.024 --> 38:06.458
and  waking
them up,

38:06.458 --> 38:07.624
'cause we're making
ourselves look stupid.

38:07.624 --> 38:08.858
Dan's gotta step up
to the plate,

38:08.858 --> 38:10.658
and you need to get them
together a little bit.

38:10.658 --> 38:12.124
Running 'em around, yeah?

38:12.124 --> 38:14.624
Yeah, we're sinking
and we're falling behind.

38:14.624 --> 38:16.158
All right...

38:16.158 --> 38:16.868
Dan, please, just make sure
that anything

38:16.868 --> 38:17.658
Dan, please, just make sure
that anything

38:17.658 --> 38:19.391
that you're doing you're doing
two of or three of,

38:19.391 --> 38:21.958
because we're falling behind.

38:21.958 --> 38:23.191
Keone's your man,
your liaison,

38:23.191 --> 38:25.624
off the same page.
yes, chef.

38:25.624 --> 38:27.324
This is what I need
you guys to start doing.

38:27.324 --> 38:29.558
Get bowls of chips,
and we're gonna start

38:29.558 --> 38:31.558
giving them to the tables
so they can munch on 'em

38:31.558 --> 38:33.191
while they're waiting
on the food, okay?
thank you, thank you.

38:33.191 --> 38:35.024
Everybody gets chips.

38:35.024 --> 38:36.791
There's a little chips
to hold you over.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.558
This is really good.
Mmm!

38:38.558 --> 38:41.158
Hey, guys, there's also
dessert that's floating around.

38:41.158 --> 38:42.691
Okay, so make somebody
else do it.
Mom, mom...

38:42.691 --> 38:44.691
Give me the ticket--i'll take
it back and get it done.

38:44.691 --> 38:46.868
No, mom, no.

38:46.868 --> 38:47.624
No, mom, no.

38:47.624 --> 38:49.224
You're not knowing
what's going on, mom.

38:49.224 --> 38:50.391
Hmph.

38:50.391 --> 38:53.291
I definitely want my mom
to understand

38:53.291 --> 38:54.591
I can make this thing work.

38:54.591 --> 38:55.824
Walk around.

38:55.824 --> 38:57.458
Talk to the guests.
You're more important that way.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.358
No, you can, mom.
I can't talk to them
because there's no food.

38:59.358 --> 39:01.191
Keone, I don't want
to argue with you.

39:01.191 --> 39:02.558
You like to argue
too much.
This isn't an argument.

39:02.558 --> 39:04.591
Okay, what number
is this--K-7?

39:04.591 --> 39:05.624
Mom, mom, mom.

39:05.624 --> 39:06.891
Stand away from this area.

39:06.891 --> 39:08.591
You can't help, mom,
not right now.

39:08.591 --> 39:11.358
I need two seconds
with you--please.

39:11.358 --> 39:12.524
You've got to let him do it.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.191
You've got to let Keone
do it.

39:14.191 --> 39:15.491
He's trying, you know,

39:15.491 --> 39:16.868
he's showing that level
of commitment.

39:16.868 --> 39:17.224
he's showing that level
of commitment.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.991
Let him do it.
Schmooze the dining room, okay?

39:18.991 --> 39:20.824
30 seconds, bobbing around
each little table.

39:20.824 --> 39:23.258
Okay? Let him do it.
Let him find his voice.

39:23.258 --> 39:25.224
I just wanna finish
this order right here, guys.

39:25.224 --> 39:27.724
It's going too slow, Dan.
I understand that.

39:27.724 --> 39:30.124
You can put more shrimp
in there than that, right?
No, I can't.

39:30.124 --> 39:31.758
You can at least
fit one more in there.

39:31.758 --> 39:33.224
This is almost an hour
on this ticket.

39:33.224 --> 39:34.758
There ya go.

39:34.758 --> 39:36.024
Keone's leadership

39:36.024 --> 39:37.358
Has helped stabilize
the kitchen...

39:37.358 --> 39:38.591
Can you work on
four beef patties

39:38.591 --> 39:39.658
and two jerk wings?

39:39.658 --> 39:41.124
Allowing customers

39:41.124 --> 39:44.024
to finally get a taste
of the new Kingston Cafe.

39:44.024 --> 39:45.824
Oh! Oh, that looks amazing!

39:45.824 --> 39:46.824
Wow.
It's beautiful.

39:46.824 --> 39:46.868
I have the prettiest plate.

39:46.868 --> 39:48.258
I have the prettiest plate.

39:48.258 --> 39:50.424
I need another
coconut rum shrimp.

39:50.424 --> 39:53.958
Finally.
I would definitely
come back just for this.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.724
We just need
to finish this.

39:55.724 --> 39:56.924
How is everybody doing?

39:56.924 --> 39:58.591
We love it.

39:58.591 --> 39:59.791
We're enjoying
just the ambiance.

39:59.791 --> 40:00.991
Good.
I really appreciate that.

40:00.991 --> 40:02.258
I guarantee to you

40:02.258 --> 40:06.324
we're gonna be so much
faster and better, okay?

40:06.324 --> 40:08.024
The fact that
I've opened up

40:08.024 --> 40:12.491
and is committed
to keep his menu...

40:12.491 --> 40:13.924
That's a big thing for me.

40:13.924 --> 40:15.691
Mmm!

40:15.691 --> 40:16.868
Well, let me tell you,
I grew up on patties

40:16.868 --> 40:17.758
Well, let me tell you,
I grew up on patties

40:17.758 --> 40:19.424
in Jamaica in Kingston.

40:19.424 --> 40:21.224
That squash Patty
was absolutely amazing.

40:21.224 --> 40:23.191
It took me back
to my childhood days.

40:23.191 --> 40:24.324
Really?
Yes!

40:24.324 --> 40:25.958
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

40:25.958 --> 40:27.358
All right, guys.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.324
Dinner service is over.

40:31.224 --> 40:34.024
Okay. What a night, yeah?

40:34.024 --> 40:37.424
But we had a buzz
out there on the patio

40:37.424 --> 40:38.791
and a buzz
in the dining room, right?

40:38.791 --> 40:41.124
The customers clearly
love the food.

40:41.124 --> 40:43.124
That's good. Clearly,
we did have other problems.

40:43.124 --> 40:46.258
But there was one person
that did step up

40:46.258 --> 40:46.868
and helped in a big way
to turn things around.

40:46.868 --> 40:49.491
and helped in a big way
to turn things around.

40:49.491 --> 40:50.858
Keone.

40:50.858 --> 40:51.858
Keone.
Thank you.

40:51.858 --> 40:54.224
You're welcome.

40:54.224 --> 40:55.858
Good job!

40:55.858 --> 40:58.491
tonight, Keone really
stepped up to the plate.

40:58.491 --> 40:59.658
I'm so proud of him.

40:59.658 --> 41:02.591
He did a fantastic job.

41:02.591 --> 41:03.991
To all of you...

41:03.991 --> 41:06.358
Cook your hearts out...

41:06.358 --> 41:08.858
And serve with a smile.

41:08.858 --> 41:11.558
Good luck.
Thank you, chef.

41:11.558 --> 41:13.124
Una, can I have just
a little word with you

41:13.124 --> 41:15.158
through there, yeah?
thank you.

41:15.158 --> 41:16.868
It's been a gigantic
step forward,

41:16.868 --> 41:18.791
It's been a gigantic
step forward,

41:18.791 --> 41:21.458
and we are only
gonna get better.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.958
Now, Keone...

41:23.958 --> 41:25.791
He proved he's capable.

41:25.791 --> 41:27.091
Oh, I know he is.

41:27.091 --> 41:29.258
Very intelligent
young man.

41:29.258 --> 41:30.758
I know, but you have
a tough decision.

41:30.758 --> 41:32.291
If you're gonna make him
part of the business,

41:32.291 --> 41:33.858
then commit
to doing that.

41:36.024 --> 41:39.158
Either you make him feel like
a partner in the business

41:39.158 --> 41:41.858
or you let him go,
you cut the apron strings.

41:41.858 --> 41:44.058
One or the other,
okay?
Okay.

41:44.058 --> 41:46.224
Your decision.
Now, there's one more thing.

41:48.324 --> 41:50.158
Do you fancy a race?

41:50.158 --> 41:51.791
Oh, you wanna run?
Yeah!

41:51.791 --> 41:54.524
Okay, come.
No, I'm joking,
I'm joking, I'm joking.

41:54.524 --> 41:56.458
Oh, no.
God bless you!

41:56.458 --> 41:58.458
Initially,
I didn't like Chef Ramsay.

41:58.458 --> 41:59.924
I'm telling you--
you're trying
to lecture me--

41:59.924 --> 42:01.391
no. let me finish.

42:01.391 --> 42:05.524
But now I realize
that he has a wonderful heart.

42:05.524 --> 42:08.791
He's gonna be so proud of us
when he comes back.

42:08.791 --> 42:12.258
What a week.
My goodness me.

42:12.258 --> 42:15.358
I only hope that this
Olympian, doctor, mother

42:15.358 --> 42:16.868
can now add
successful restaurateur

42:16.868 --> 42:17.891
can now add
successful restaurateur

42:17.891 --> 42:19.624
to her resume.

42:19.624 --> 42:21.691
Why?
Because she deserves it.

42:21.691 --> 42:23.624
Big-time.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.591
Let me finish!

42:25.591 --> 42:28.091
Let...Me...Finish!

42:30.558 --> 42:33.058
Shortly after
Chef Ramsay's departure,

42:33.058 --> 42:34.724
Una decided
to encourage Keone

42:34.724 --> 42:36.991
to concentrate
on his education

42:36.991 --> 42:38.858
and step back
from the restaurant.

42:38.858 --> 42:40.158
You know,
I'll always love you.

42:40.158 --> 42:42.658
Don't care, you and I
fight and I...

42:42.658 --> 42:45.091
You know?
Of course.

42:45.091 --> 42:46.868
Una, however,
is more dedicated than ever.

42:46.868 --> 42:48.391
Una, however,
is more dedicated than ever.

42:48.391 --> 42:50.258
She is committed
to cooking fresh,

42:50.258 --> 42:51.758
collaborating with her staff,

42:51.758 --> 42:55.324
and maintaining the standards
Chef Ramsay put in place.

42:55.324 --> 42:56.558
Please enjoy.

42:56.558 --> 42:58.858
As long as I follow

42:58.858 --> 43:01.091
what Coach Ramsay
explained to me

43:01.091 --> 43:02.824
what we need to do...

43:02.824 --> 43:04.724
It has to look good
and has to taste good.

43:04.724 --> 43:06.724
The future of Kingston Cafe
looks great.
