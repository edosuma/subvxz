00:06.093 --> 00:07.616
DR. WATKINS: I have an update
on Petty Officer Sawyer.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.096
We'll bring him out
of his coma tomorrow morning.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.054
Looks like you guys
took some hits.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.882
RAY: We've been helping out
this homeless vet, Sam.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.015
Naima was gonna take him
down to the DMV,

00:15.058 --> 00:16.451
but he never showed.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.974
HANNAH:
So, what's y'all's story?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.063
-Just friends.
-Mm-hmm.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.804
RAY: You two might actually
have a future together.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.762
You're afraid of making it real.

00:23.806 --> 00:24.807
You're a prime candidate
for Breacher's Syndrome.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.374
So is every other frogman.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.679
I encourage you to look now,

00:27.723 --> 00:30.073
before the effects
become disastrous.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.293
CLAY: Found a room with
an explosive hazard.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.337
JASON:
Mark it for EOD.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.209
Put the breach
next to that door!

00:35.252 --> 00:36.862
[explosion]

00:36.906 --> 00:39.909
Jason brought the building down.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.443

00:57.492 --> 00:58.667
RAY:
Grenade!

00:58.710 --> 01:00.060

01:08.329 --> 01:09.808
MANDY:
You know, it's tragic, really.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.332
What's that?

01:11.375 --> 01:14.161
Even a Tier One legend

01:14.204 --> 01:17.860
can't escape taking work
home with him.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.122
Well, I'm not home.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.691
[laughs] Okay, um, taking work

01:22.734 --> 01:25.389
to his secret
Delaware den of iniquity.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.175
Been clicking away
most of the night.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.351
Well, I'll put the work away.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.396
-Okay?
-Um, I'm just...

01:32.440 --> 01:33.702
kidding. I totally get it

01:33.745 --> 01:35.747
if there's fallout to deal with.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.706
Fallout? What do you
mean by that?

01:37.749 --> 01:40.883
Last op put Bravo
in the hospital.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.146
I'm sure Command
wants a paper trail

01:43.190 --> 01:44.626
after a near disaster like that.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.715
JASON: Enemy got lucky
with an RPG, all right?

01:46.758 --> 01:48.717
Everyone's fine.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.980
Clearly.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.069
Look, last night, I...

01:53.113 --> 01:55.202
My body wasn't really
cooperating with me.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.812
[laughs]

01:56.855 --> 01:57.900
Oh, my God.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.989
I'd say it cooperated

02:00.032 --> 02:03.862
by any reasonable
human standard.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.560
[sighs] You just called me
the "H" word.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.562
You did not call me
the "H" word, did you?

02:07.605 --> 02:11.914
[chuckles] Doesn't have
to be a marathon every time.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.960
Mm... Maybe we're due for a

02:15.004 --> 02:16.223
change of locale?

02:16.266 --> 02:17.441
Thought you liked this spot?

02:17.485 --> 02:18.747
-Oh, I do.
-Yeah?

02:18.790 --> 02:21.053
Maybe next time...

02:22.968 --> 02:25.797
...we go your way.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.669
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.019
Mm-hmm.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.461
Tell you what,
instead of a marathon,

02:37.505 --> 02:39.811
how about a 10K?

02:39.855 --> 02:41.552
Metric system?

02:43.337 --> 02:44.468
[chuckles]

02:44.512 --> 02:47.254
Oh, go on.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.299
[laughing]

02:53.477 --> 02:56.219
[laughs] Hey.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.569
-Hey.
-Wow, you look radiant.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.790
-[laughs] Thank you.
-Mm.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.444
What happened? Did you guys
stop at the Bulkhead

03:03.487 --> 03:05.272
on the way back from
the radiologist or something?

03:05.315 --> 03:06.621
Uh, not exactly.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.100
-He's, uh...
-[clears throat]

03:08.144 --> 03:10.015
He's buzzed on good news.

Tumor showing
signs of shrinkage.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.497
That's right.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.238
Finally figured out
it's messing with Ash Spenser.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.198
-[laughs]
-Are you serious?

03:18.241 --> 03:20.069
See if they can inject
some humility in him

03:20.112 --> 03:22.463
-when I take him to chemo later.
-[chuckles]

03:22.506 --> 03:25.509
Three more sessions
and then they reevaluate.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.903
Wow. [stammers]
I'm so happy for you.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.252
That's amazing.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.427
-Right?
-Yeah.

03:30.471 --> 03:33.343
I am gonna go for a walk
at the beach.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.302
-It's a beautiful day...
-Yeah.

03:35.345 --> 03:38.348
...and a target-rich environment
for a little eye candy.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.045
At least your boorishness
hasn't been cured.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.488
Hey, I'm, uh...

03:47.531 --> 03:51.100
Look, I'm sorry I missed
the prenatal checkup again.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.581
It's okay. It was only
five minutes, no big deal.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.061
No, I... I should've been there.

03:56.105 --> 03:59.064
You've got enough on your mind.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.243
You didn't sleep again.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.809
Hard to rest when
I'm about to drop a bomb

04:04.853 --> 04:06.985
on my-my friend and team leader.

04:07.029 --> 04:10.293
Are you sure he's so oblivious
to the mistake that he made?

04:10.337 --> 04:11.686
You said yourself
he's been laying low

04:11.729 --> 04:13.514
since you came back
from the hospital.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.953
Could be he smells an ambush.

04:17.996 --> 04:21.348
But you're not attacking him.
You're trying to help him.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.959
Yeah, by telling him
his head's so cracked

04:24.002 --> 04:25.917
he nearly blew up his own team.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.054
Well, you said there's
some new TBI treatments

04:32.097 --> 04:34.056
you could talk to him about.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.624
Yeah, but, I mean,
all he's gonna hear

04:36.667 --> 04:37.886
is that his bird's at risk.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.235
And if you keep quiet?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.671
Are you and your teammates
lucky enough

04:40.715 --> 04:44.458
to end up in the hospital
next time he slips up?

04:46.895 --> 04:49.637
I'll talk to him. Today.

05:03.346 --> 05:06.436
Oh. Kid's still got me beat

Yeah, fashion sense, too,
with those

05:09.396 --> 05:10.919

05:54.484 --> 05:57.444
Well, she wired the money.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.141
It'll be in
our account tomorrow.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.404
Feels heavy, huh?

06:01.448 --> 06:05.103
No heavier than being told
how much my dad's life was worth

06:05.147 --> 06:07.584
after the Towers came down.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.676
You know, I was happy
that the-the 9/11 settlement

06:12.720 --> 06:14.722
was gonna take care
of Mom, but I...

06:16.158 --> 06:18.421
I never wanted to think
about the money.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.641
You made her happy
by accepting it.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.077
Babe, the...

06:22.120 --> 06:24.122
That money is...

06:24.166 --> 06:25.472
it's just another reminder

06:25.515 --> 06:28.126
that Pop would still be
here if it wasn't for me.

06:30.128 --> 06:33.436
You've been dealing with

06:33.480 --> 06:35.046
so much.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.744
Your PTS drama,

06:36.787 --> 06:39.790
questions you've been raising
about the impact

your missions have on the world.

Yeah.

Only 18 months
till your 20-year pension.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.716
This money could allow you

06:52.760 --> 06:56.590
to step away
from operating if you wanted.

Besides, I... [sighs]

07:08.471 --> 07:11.039
Pop didn't give his life
so I could kick my damn feet up.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.389
Not what I'm saying.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.871
You're always gonna be
living with purpose.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.916
This is a chance to

07:18.960 --> 07:22.180
refocus on what that purpose is.

You want anything?

Uh...

I got to go back to the base.

Right now? What's going on?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.749
Soto didn't say. I...

08:08.792 --> 08:12.448
So urgent you can't tell them
you're out of town?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.190
I can't. I mean, come on,
you know that. It's-it's my job.

-Yeah.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.734
Something concerning
has come to light.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.475
What's that?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.173
NSA techs who scan the web
for operator security

08:42.217 --> 08:45.220
found an image that has been
in heavy circulation among

08:45.263 --> 08:47.527
Islamic extremist sites.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.052
That's the train takedown
in Burkina Faso.

08:51.095 --> 08:54.098
The sites are blaming this
operator for foiling the plot

08:54.142 --> 08:57.624
and taking out the would-be
martyrs on board.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.322

the best shot for my fan club.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.629

with those sunglasses on.

hiding behind a keyboard.

This threat is legitimate.

housing on base at Norfolk.

Yeah, Command.

needed the money. [laughs]

a profile on me.

That's got to have them
freaked out.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.118
No, it's not, actually.
You know what?

10:41.162 --> 10:42.554
They're not freaked out.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.556
Problem is I got to go
to Philadelphia now

10:44.600 --> 10:46.602
and convince my dad
to come back.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.736
And that... He's a fucking
pain in the ass.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.956
Well, if your dad's
anything like my dad,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.611
I'd say you'd probably need
Bravo for the op.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.395
Well, I'll handle it.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.571
-Hey, Jason?
-Yeah?

10:59.615 --> 11:01.748
Hey, uh...
I know the timing sucks,

11:01.791 --> 11:05.316
but, uh, I got, I got to,
I got to tell you all something.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.407
Uh, after today,

11:09.451 --> 11:12.933
I-I need to stand down
for a while.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.937
After the hospital,
you know, I-I thought

11:16.980 --> 11:19.983
I could go jump
right back in, but, uh,

11:20.027 --> 11:22.682
it's-it's not happening.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.510
Your head?

11:25.554 --> 11:28.775
Head's good.
Neck down's the problem. Uh...

11:28.818 --> 11:31.299
This last op did some new damage
to my back and my hip,

11:31.342 --> 11:34.302
and I'm still five surgeries
behind on the old stuff.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.956
Apparently,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.785
ignoring injuries over time
doesn't actually heal them.

11:38.828 --> 11:42.092
How long you gonna be out for?

11:42.136 --> 11:44.007
Honestly, I-I don't know.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.662
Uh, a month, a year?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.751
It scares me
to even think about it.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.275
Being away from Bravo
is gonna kill me,

11:51.319 --> 11:52.973
but...

11:53.016 --> 11:55.932
you guys deserve
the best version of me.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.721
So...

12:01.764 --> 12:04.375
Really sorry to hear about this.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.813
Ah... You know I love you guys.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.945
RAY:
Love you, too, buddy.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.474
[chuckling]

12:20.043 --> 12:21.610
Take care of yourself.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.438
See you, man.

12:23.481 --> 12:26.397
Bye. Good luck.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.096
See you, brother.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.663
-Have a good one, all right?
-Yeah.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.665
Be safe, man. See you.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.798
Go, uh, go take care
of your family, man.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.147
Will do.

12:41.325 --> 12:44.459
[quiet chatter]

12:51.596 --> 12:53.598
Excuse me.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.819
Uh, you know a man
named Sam Hughes?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.168
He had a

12:58.212 --> 13:00.431
blue tent behind
the grocery store on Oakwood?

13:00.475 --> 13:02.085
Never heard of him, Officer.

13:02.129 --> 13:05.785
[chuckles] It's not like that.
I'm not a cop.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.006
Big Red One.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.796
Might've worked with you
in Ghazni back in 2012.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.843
Sam hasn't been around
for weeks.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.845
You're looking to swap
war stories,

13:22.889 --> 13:25.108
knock on any of the other tents.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.814
Thank you for your time.

13:49.176 --> 13:52.614
That's terrible about Jason.
How scary

13:52.657 --> 13:54.485
for his family. My God.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.836
Yeah. [scoffs]

13:56.879 --> 13:58.315
Here I thought
I was gonna be the one

13:58.359 --> 14:00.883
blasting a hole in his day.

14:02.711 --> 14:05.453
Dad, I'm gonna, uh,
I'm-a take a shower,

14:05.496 --> 14:07.934
and then we'll head
off to chemo.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.284
You know,
I've been thinking, um,

14:10.327 --> 14:13.069
if I'm gonna be above ground a
little longer than we expected,

14:13.113 --> 14:15.811
we might want to set up
some boundaries.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.640
I'm all for fun and games
and grandpa duties and all that,

14:18.683 --> 14:20.207
but don't think for a second

14:20.250 --> 14:22.383
you're gonna be getting
some free childcare out of me.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.994
Oh, oh, wow, all right,
don't worry. Hey, there are

14:25.038 --> 14:27.301
uh, there are some deposed
dictators that are higher up

14:27.344 --> 14:28.737
-on that list than you.
-[laughs] Really?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.217
Yeah. We're-we're good.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.654
Ah, well, you say that now,
but just wait

14:32.697 --> 14:35.439
until you're all spun-up
and she's on no sleep

14:35.483 --> 14:36.919
and she's pulling her hair out.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.486
You're gonna be singing
a different tune then.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.835
STELLA:
Uh, okay, okay. I already,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.402
I already talked
to the CYP department

14:41.445 --> 14:43.839
at Norfolk, who referred me
to some amazing daycares,

14:43.883 --> 14:46.929
and I have a growing
network of support between

14:46.973 --> 14:51.325
Naima and Hannah and all of
Blackburn's ex-wives.

14:51.368 --> 14:54.589
Plus, there's also caffeine,
which I like, so that's good.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.547
That's good.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.115
I mean, it sounds like
you won't even really need me.

14:59.159 --> 15:02.727
I'm just trying to plan
for what we can't plan for.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.991
[cell phone buzzing]

15:07.732 --> 15:09.473
Okay.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.866
You can-- You should go.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.955
I'll-I'll take him
to his appointment.

15:12.999 --> 15:16.524
Yeah. Don't worry about it, son.
She's better for my ego anyway.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.005
We got it handled.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.268
Yeah.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.227
You've got it handled.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.974
[dog barking in distance]

15:46.293 --> 15:47.947
Dad.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.559
Dad, it's me. Come on.
We got to go.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.865
Dad?

15:54.779 --> 15:56.085
[sighs] Come on. Let's go.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.174
Told you it'd be a waste
of time driving up here.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.133
All right, look, I told Mom
I would get you to the hotel,

16:00.176 --> 16:01.786
so I got to get you
to the hotel.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.788
You know you got Mom scared now.
She thinks ISIS

16:03.832 --> 16:05.573
is gonna be pissing
in her azaleas.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.922
That's great. You know what?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.663
I'm just trying to follow
protocol, all right?

16:08.706 --> 16:09.925
Get your bag packed
and let's go.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.840
I couldn't go if I wanted to.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.277
I got a football banquet
tomorrow night.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.366
My kids need me there.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.239
What good would a banquet be
without a head coach?

16:19.282 --> 16:21.328
Your kids need you, right?
You're in danger right now.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.243
Do you understand me?
So what do you say we

16:23.286 --> 16:25.680
just put the bad chicken dinner
and the Knute Rockne quotes,

16:25.723 --> 16:27.073
put them on hold
and let's go.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.292
Well, it's not medals
in the Oval Office,

16:29.336 --> 16:31.338
but it does mean a little
something to some people.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.689
Dad, please. I'm just trying
to keep you safe. Can we go?

16:34.732 --> 16:36.256
Then come on in and relax...

16:36.299 --> 16:37.605
I don't want to come in
and relax.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.346
...'cause I'm not
going anywhere.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.090
Here we are.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.658
Fadhil Morad. Iraqi national
who spent a decade

16:47.702 --> 16:50.705
carving out a reputation as the
most formidable arms trafficker

16:50.748 --> 16:52.707
along the Iraq-Turkey border.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.317
The weapons he and his men
have smuggled

16:54.361 --> 16:56.841
has had an immeasurable impact
on warfare in the region,

16:56.885 --> 16:59.540
while making Morad
a wealthy man.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.325
Arms trafficker's a little low
on the food chain

17:02.369 --> 17:03.979
for the Spec Ops shark,
isn't it?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.764
Bravo won't be spinning up
to eliminate Morad.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.114
We'll be going
to make friends with him.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.812
You're sending a SEAL team
to make friends?

17:10.855 --> 17:12.466
What, was the PAW Patrol busy?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.076
[laughs]

17:14.120 --> 17:16.339
Only time I'll ever say this,
I am sure as hell glad

17:16.383 --> 17:18.080
that Jason ain't rolling
with us because the man

17:18.124 --> 17:21.127
makes friends like a porcupine
in a nudist colony.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.825
DAVIS: Morad's position in the
underworld has him tapped into

17:23.868 --> 17:26.306
streams of intel that
our agency cannot access.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.003
Convincing him
to share that intel

17:28.047 --> 17:29.483
could provide crucial insight

17:29.526 --> 17:32.007
into those nations'
defense programs.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.314
To that end, our partners
in the UK's MI6

17:34.357 --> 17:36.316
have arranged
for a sit-down with Morad

17:36.359 --> 17:40.015
to provide him a cache of intel
in hopes he'll reciprocate.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.495
Bravo Team will accompany

17:41.538 --> 17:44.280
two British Special Boat Service
operators to the meeting

17:44.324 --> 17:47.109
at a remote location
in northern Iraq.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.806
A lot of firepower for
a "friendly" get-together, yeah?

17:48.850 --> 17:52.071
SOTO: Morad and his men are
hardened, well-armed criminals.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.420
They've had previous dealings
with the Brits,

17:53.463 --> 17:55.204
which ended badly.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.424
Few years back, the Brits
tried to win Morad over

17:57.467 --> 18:00.601
by feeding him some intel,
turned out to be wrong,

18:00.644 --> 18:02.342
got one of Morad's men killed.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.909
So this sit-down could be
more of a setup.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.346
Chance for Morad to get revenge.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.087
With Jason sidelined,

18:08.130 --> 18:09.653
Ray will be serving
as team leader.

18:09.697 --> 18:13.527
SONNY: Oh, God, we're down
two men before high tea.

18:13.570 --> 18:17.748
What a day to be stepping into
an Iraqi snake pit.

18:26.844 --> 18:30.109
I feel for Jason.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.589
You know, it's, uh...

18:32.633 --> 18:35.201
It's hard to imagine an op
following you home that way.

18:35.244 --> 18:39.074
No shortage of ways for this job
to hit you where you live, Clay.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.382
Maybe it's better
he gets some distance

18:42.425 --> 18:45.254
after our last op.

18:45.298 --> 18:48.083
Last op was a bad hand
from the start.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.780
What you getting at?

18:51.434 --> 18:52.957
Uh, just that...

18:54.263 --> 18:57.962
Team lives or dies by his calls.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.964
Good or bad.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.188
You know, uh,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.756
someone foolish enough
to try to pin a Murphy's law op

19:08.799 --> 19:10.453
on Jason, well...

19:10.497 --> 19:14.501
might be the same type to
whisper in Command's ear about

19:14.544 --> 19:17.112
me in Nigeria.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.988
Look, if I ever come for you,

19:24.032 --> 19:26.295
you'll know it's me.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.785
JASON:
Yeah, I'm on my way. Okay, look,

19:37.828 --> 19:40.266
Mikey sounded really worried
on the phone. Can we go now?

19:40.309 --> 19:41.963
Damn shame he has to miss
tonight's game

19:42.006 --> 19:43.138
for this nonsense.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.315
-Oh, geez.
-It's Lakewood High.

19:46.359 --> 19:49.057
He had a hat trick
against them last month.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.190
It was one goal, okay?
It was one goal, all right?

19:51.233 --> 19:53.235
Hat trick came
against St. Viator's.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.628
No.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.848
It was Lakewood.
He called me after the game.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.505
Well, you know what,
I'll tell you what,

20:02.549 --> 20:03.941
lucky for Mikey
you're not his coach, huh?

20:03.985 --> 20:05.291
So you won't bench him

20:05.334 --> 20:06.292
so you could flex
for the school, right?

20:06.335 --> 20:07.902
You were late for practice.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.730
[groans]

20:09.773 --> 20:11.558
Break the rules,
deal with the consequences.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.168
You know this.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.735
I was three minutes late.
Doug Lewin ran out of gas.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.040
Shit happens, Dad.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.694
I coached you to
a city championship.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.261
[exhales]

20:19.305 --> 20:21.785
The only thing you remember
is that I punished you

20:21.829 --> 20:24.353
for putting yourself first.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.312
Clearly, you don't remember
the lesson, either.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.357
Always putting myself first.
Because, you know what?

20:28.401 --> 20:32.187
Driving out here is exactly
what I wanted to do today, Dad.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.493
Chance to make a point to me?

20:33.536 --> 20:35.234
-What point?
-You've gone a lot farther

20:35.277 --> 20:37.758
than that,
all the way to Coronado.

20:37.801 --> 20:40.282
You still think that I enlisted

20:40.326 --> 20:41.849
because of you. You're unreal.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.721
Just a coincidence

20:44.765 --> 20:47.768
you signed up out of the blue,

20:47.811 --> 20:49.857
one day before I was scheduled

20:49.900 --> 20:51.337
to drive you around to your

20:51.380 --> 20:54.078
recruiting visits
that I arranged?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.343
Dad, get upstairs.
Will you get upstairs now?

20:57.386 --> 20:58.735
-What?
-There's somebody out--

20:58.779 --> 20:59.867
-Get upstairs now.
-Hey!

20:59.910 --> 21:02.086
It's Colin Krause.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.653
Col-Colin Krause.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.916
He lives across the street.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.920
The hell is he doing out there?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.966
-I didn't recognize him.
-He probably wanted to come

21:12.009 --> 21:14.360
get a look at his old pal,
but you're jumping up and down

21:14.403 --> 21:17.276
like it's
Lee Harvey Oswald outside.

21:18.364 --> 21:21.323
[sighs] I didn't
recognize him. I...

21:21.367 --> 21:23.238
Summer you were 15,
you, Colin, and Alana

34:36.204 --> 34:38.554
All right? You don't understand
what this job does to you.

34:38.598 --> 34:41.209
The toll it takes on your body,
on your brain.

34:41.253 --> 34:44.343
-Everything. It is a complete...
-Blaming the job

34:44.386 --> 34:47.476
frees you from feeling
responsible. Well...

34:48.521 --> 34:50.566
After all Alana did for you,

34:50.610 --> 34:52.873
she suffered alone

34:52.916 --> 34:54.962
because
the legendary Jason Hayes

34:55.005 --> 34:57.269
always puts himself first.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.140
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.055
That I was a shitty husband?
Okay, fine.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.057
I was a shitty husband. There.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.842
You happy now?
She deserved better.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.062
I know that. She knew that.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.064
She sacrificed everything
for this family,

35:10.108 --> 35:13.502
and she's the one who died.
She died, Dad, not me.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.854
That's the one thing, you know?
That is the one thing

35:17.898 --> 35:19.378
that sticks
in my head these days.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.119
It's the only thing.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.863
[sighs]

35:27.647 --> 35:29.214
It's late.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.913
Good night, son.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.962
[exhales]

35:45.230 --> 35:46.840
Ugh.

35:48.494 --> 35:53.412
Sending Sonny to grab
that radio, the water exfil...

35:53.455 --> 35:56.676
That's impressive headwork.
You came up big on an op

35:56.719 --> 35:59.200
that I needed to go well.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.943
Glad my ambition didn't
get in the way.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.553
[laughs]

36:04.597 --> 36:07.121
Yeah.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.210
I wa-- I was wrong earlier, man.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.996
I shouldn't have accused you
of ratting me out.

36:14.607 --> 36:17.218
For what it's worth, I didn't.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.481
I know.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.747
Man, I'm on Bravo
because you jumped on

36:24.791 --> 36:27.794
that Marsden grenade for me.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.839
It's just...

36:29.883 --> 36:32.277
between worrying
about Jason being doxxed,

36:32.320 --> 36:35.976
and paranoid about
what Command knows,

36:36.019 --> 36:39.066
Sam going AWOL, I...

36:39.109 --> 36:41.808
My head's been spinning
more than usual.

36:41.851 --> 36:45.290
-I hear that.
-Yeah.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.161
It's felt easier to get a grip
on the battlefield

36:47.205 --> 36:49.294
than it has at home lately.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.862
Something going on?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.997
Yeah, it's complicated.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.174
Outside-the-wire problems
are simpler.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.309
I could swear I just heard
Jason Hayes right there.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.049
[chuckles]

37:06.093 --> 37:08.226
Good work, brother.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.081
[phone buzzing]

37:40.910 --> 37:42.564
Lieutenant Soto.

37:42.608 --> 37:46.873
The problem blew over,
so I'm heading home.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.702
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

37:49.745 --> 37:55.142
Yeah. There was no identifying
details about me online,

37:55.185 --> 37:59.799
so this, uh, this glory chaser
is anonymous again.

37:59.842 --> 38:02.323
Well, good.
It's gotta be a load off.

38:02.367 --> 38:07.546
Some of the things
I said last night, uh...

38:07.589 --> 38:09.374
I've always been better with
other people's kids

38:09.417 --> 38:12.202
than my own.

38:12.246 --> 38:16.250
Maybe you deserved better
from me.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.992
You did the best you could.

38:19.035 --> 38:22.387
Something I couldn't do
for Alana.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.346
Something you were saying
last night about

38:25.390 --> 38:27.566
hard time keeping things
straight in your head.

38:27.609 --> 38:32.135
I've been doing my reading about
this brain injury stuff.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.488
Dad, I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

38:36.531 --> 38:38.185
-I got a long ride home.
-All right.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.535
All right?
You enjoy your banquet tonight.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.322
Drive careful.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.673
All right, well, cheers to you

38:47.716 --> 38:50.110
finally getting a buyer
for your bar.

38:50.153 --> 38:54.201
And, uh, may, uh,
may they never curse it

38:54.244 --> 38:56.812
with an artisanal olive or IPA.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.337
[both laugh]

39:00.468 --> 39:02.862
I'm gonna miss that place.
And Texas.

39:02.905 --> 39:04.211
Yeah.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.126
But the sacrifices we make
for family.

39:06.169 --> 39:08.737
Amen.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.739
What in the hell? Davis!

39:10.783 --> 39:11.958
I didn't expect to

39:12.001 --> 39:13.960
see the brain trust
out tonight.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.309
What you doing here, Davis?

39:15.353 --> 39:18.704
Um, Grant, this is Hannah
and Sonny.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.140
-Sonny and I work together.
-Hey.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.011
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

39:22.055 --> 39:23.186
-Yeah.
-Lisa,

39:23.230 --> 39:24.405
it's great to finally meet you

39:24.449 --> 39:26.102
-in person.
-Meet you in person. Yes.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.539
Why don't you join us?

39:28.583 --> 39:31.238
-Great. Yeah. Sure.
-Yeah.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.980
-Why not, man? Hey...
-Gonna need one more chair.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.069
...it's a party over here.

39:36.112 --> 39:37.462
You are a gentleman, Grant.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.986
I've actually heard a lot
about you, man.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.204
GRANT:
Oh...

39:41.248 --> 39:42.510
-Oh, yeah.
-DAVIS: Good things.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.338
Very good things.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.776
So, Hannah, you also still
getting used to these two

39:47.820 --> 39:50.562
vanishing for days
to undisclosed locations?

39:50.605 --> 39:53.173
Oh, yeah.
It takes some adjustment.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.175
Mm. But we, uh, you know,

39:55.218 --> 39:57.264
we figured out what works,
and...

39:58.744 --> 40:01.442
-...everybody's happy. Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.186
Except, uh, well, Brock.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.666
Yeah, um,

40:07.709 --> 40:10.016
Leanne, uh, well, she detonates
her biggest diaper

40:10.059 --> 40:12.453
-right about now.
-Wait, I'm sorry,

40:12.497 --> 40:13.541
-Brock is babysitting?
-Mm-hmm.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.238
-Oh, wow, no.
-SONNY: Yes.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.675
Yeah, he-he owed me one.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.851
Are you still claiming
that he cheated you

40:18.894 --> 40:21.375
in the hospital Olympics?

40:21.419 --> 40:24.030
Wait, did she say
"hospital Olympics"?

40:24.073 --> 40:25.597
Well, you know, a whole team
of frogmen recuperating

40:25.640 --> 40:27.990
have to find some way
to amuse themselves.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.341
Wait, the whole team was
in the hospital? When was that?

40:31.385 --> 40:34.780
Oh, nah. I mean...
Uh, it's not, honestly--

40:34.823 --> 40:36.608
It's not really a big deal.
We were...

40:36.651 --> 40:40.089
Hey, Hannah, Sonny says that
you're liking Vah Beach.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.788
It's good.
Trying to find my footing.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.703
DAVIS: Well, if you ever
need a break from Sonny's

40:44.746 --> 40:46.705
-all-carcinogen diet...
-[sarcastic laugh]

40:46.748 --> 40:49.055
I can recommend some
great restaurants for you.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.273
I hope it's not that Thai place.

40:50.317 --> 40:51.840
Uh, you love that Thai place.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.843
Oh, anything's better than
that horrific sushi place.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.192
This is a very refined palette

40:56.236 --> 40:58.760
from a man who heats
his Twinkies.

40:58.804 --> 41:01.241
Ain't nothing wrong with
heating a Twinkie.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.329
-Oh, man.
-Okay?

41:02.372 --> 41:03.722
-Mm-hmm.
-It is true.

41:08.335 --> 41:11.120
-[laughs] Hey.
-Hey.

41:11.164 --> 41:14.602
-Hi, baby. Mm.
-Hey.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.561
How'd the op go?

41:16.604 --> 41:17.997
-It was great.
-Yeah?

41:18.040 --> 41:19.651
Yeah.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.522
How you feeling?

41:21.566 --> 41:24.438
-Amazing. Just unbelievable.
-Yeah?

41:24.482 --> 41:26.701
-Good.
-24 weeks pregnant, it's...

41:26.745 --> 41:28.224
[clicks tongue]

41:28.268 --> 41:30.749
Ooh, do you want to be
the action hero that you are...

41:30.792 --> 41:32.577
-Mm-hmm.
-...and rub my feet?

41:32.620 --> 41:35.623
-I had a different idea.
-[laughs]

41:35.667 --> 41:37.843
-I would love to rub your feet.
-Now, see, that's...

41:37.886 --> 41:39.453
-I'm gonna go do it.
-That's a good response.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.368
-All right, here it comes.
-Yay.

41:41.411 --> 41:44.023
Here comes the big war fighter
coming down here

41:44.066 --> 41:45.894
-to rub some feet.
-Yay!

41:45.938 --> 41:49.289
-[giggles]
-[chuckles]

41:49.332 --> 41:51.813
Hey, I've... I've been thinking

41:51.857 --> 41:55.643
that, um, maybe an action hero
isn't what you're gonna need

41:55.687 --> 41:57.732
in a few months.

41:58.994 --> 42:01.214
What do you mean?

42:01.257 --> 42:04.304
It's just, you know,
the way you've...

42:04.347 --> 42:05.914
the way you've been
carrying everything and...

42:05.958 --> 42:10.484
I don't want that to go on.
You know?

42:10.528 --> 42:13.269
As soon as the baby comes,

42:13.313 --> 42:14.793
I'm gonna...

42:14.836 --> 42:18.797
I'm gonna ask for some family
leave time from Bravo.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.191
Be here for real.

42:26.021 --> 42:28.981
[chuckles]
You assessing our finances,

42:29.024 --> 42:30.939
or are you planning
for world domination?

42:30.983 --> 42:32.550
Both.

42:32.593 --> 42:35.596
I transferred some
settlement money

42:35.640 --> 42:38.294
to the kids' college funds.

42:38.338 --> 42:40.601
Have you given any thought
to the rest?

42:40.645 --> 42:44.562
Yeah, actually.
Uh, you know what?

42:44.605 --> 42:47.303
Pop dedicated his life
to helping people.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.088
I think he'd be happy
if that money went

42:49.131 --> 42:51.046
to helping people like Sam.

42:51.090 --> 42:54.746
So donate to a veteran
homelessness charity?

42:54.789 --> 42:57.792
Ideally, but I spent the flight
back researching,

42:57.836 --> 42:59.620
and I couldn't find one
that provided

42:59.664 --> 43:03.232
the whole range of services
that someone like Sam needs.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.323
If I couldn't find it,
how are vets supposed to?

43:07.367 --> 43:11.327
Well, maybe that's a gap
we could fill.

43:13.155 --> 43:14.722
We? What do you mean?

43:14.766 --> 43:19.858
With my medical background
and your military experience,

43:19.901 --> 43:23.296
is it crazy to think that
you and I could start something

43:23.339 --> 43:24.776
with that money?

43:24.819 --> 43:30.042
I have known Team guys that
started non-profits.

43:30.085 --> 43:32.261
I mean, they found purpose
beyond carrying a rifle.

43:32.305 --> 43:35.134
I-It...

43:35.177 --> 43:37.615
doesn't sound that crazy at all.

43:40.748 --> 43:42.837
-Two beers.
-You got it.

43:44.709 --> 43:47.450
-Oh, hey there.
-Hey.

43:47.494 --> 43:50.018
So, Grant.

43:52.238 --> 43:55.154
He seems real nice.

43:55.197 --> 43:58.070
Thanks.

43:58.113 --> 44:00.420
Hannah's great. I'm...

44:00.463 --> 44:02.378
I'm happy for you.

44:04.946 --> 44:09.124
I'm happy for you, too.

44:09.168 --> 44:10.952
Well, good for us.

44:16.436 --> 44:20.092
Uh, we should...
we should get back.

44:20.135 --> 44:22.007
See you over there.

44:22.050 --> 44:24.313
Yeah.

44:25.053 --> 44:26.794
[exhales]

44:33.932 --> 44:35.673
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

44:35.716 --> 44:39.720
Well, when we texted last night,
I told you I'd stick around,

44:39.764 --> 44:42.984
but my flight leaves
in a couple hours.

44:43.028 --> 44:45.944
You know, I'm sorry.

44:45.987 --> 44:47.989
I'm really sorry.

44:57.172 --> 45:00.175
Is everything okay with...

45:00.219 --> 45:01.699
whatever it was?

45:01.742 --> 45:05.485
No, I am, uh...
Yeah, I handled it.

45:06.965 --> 45:08.401
[sighs]

45:08.444 --> 45:10.098
What's wrong?

45:10.142 --> 45:13.232
I've just got a lot
on my plate right now.

45:13.275 --> 45:15.800
Okay. So tell me about it.

45:15.843 --> 45:19.934
I mean, is it work?
Family stuff?

45:25.157 --> 45:26.898
It's on me. I...

45:26.941 --> 45:29.727
I don't want you
to have to pay for it.

45:31.467 --> 45:32.991
[Jason sniffles]

45:33.034 --> 45:34.732
Pay for what?

45:39.432 --> 45:41.521
Right.

45:43.871 --> 45:46.482
[crying quietly]

45:46.526 --> 45:50.008
If there's so much
on your plate,

45:50.051 --> 45:52.706
maybe we shouldn't book
this room for a while.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.839
[clears throat]

45:54.882 --> 45:56.405
[inhales]

45:56.449 --> 45:58.712
Yeah.
[groans]

46:00.018 --> 46:01.497
[sighs]

46:04.239 --> 46:06.764
[grunts]

46:08.287 --> 46:10.550
[door opens]

46:18.601 --> 46:20.908
[door shuts]

46:24.433 --> 46:27.480
Ow. [grunts]

46:27.523 --> 46:29.830
-What?
-Some... something's wrong.

46:29.874 --> 46:31.876
Baby, it's just... you're just
having a bad dream.

46:31.919 --> 46:35.575
-Okay? Lay back down.
-No, no, no. I don't feel right.

46:35.618 --> 46:36.881
-Is that...
-Oh, my God, something's--

46:36.924 --> 46:38.273
-What?
-I don't know what's happening.

46:38.317 --> 46:41.755
What do you mean?
What is it? What is it?

46:41.799 --> 46:45.106
I-I think... I think
my water just broke.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.152
-What?
-Yeah.

46:47.195 --> 46:48.631
No.

46:48.675 --> 46:50.111
This is not supposed
to be happening right now.

46:50.155 --> 46:51.591
No, no, no, no, no, no.

46:51.634 --> 46:53.027
I don't know, this isn't--

46:53.071 --> 46:54.594
This is not supposed to be
happening, not yet.

46:54.637 --> 46:55.900
I-I don't know what's happen...

46:55.943 --> 46:57.858
-Aah.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.338
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

46:59.381 --> 47:00.687
-Okay.
-Can you get up?

47:00.730 --> 47:02.123
Hey, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

47:02.167 --> 47:04.647
Okay? Just walk slow,
walk slow, walk slow, walk slow.

47:04.691 --> 47:06.084
-[grunts] Ah.
-Come on. You all right?
