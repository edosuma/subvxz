02:14.377 --> 02:17.713
Master Marco. You requested
more salt cakes?

02:17.796 --> 02:20.133
Yes. Thank you.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.148
General Aruka advised retreat.

03:18.107 --> 03:22.195
I gave the order that we turn 
and fight... like Mongols.

03:22.278 --> 03:23.862
Mongols do not lose.

03:27.450 --> 03:28.909
I have thought of nothing else

03:28.993 --> 03:31.537
these past days and nights.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.415
A ride preceded by
victory is much shorter.

03:34.498 --> 03:37.001
True words such as these
can only be drawn

03:37.085 --> 03:39.253
from a well of personal experience.

03:40.379 --> 03:41.797
Leave me with my son.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.591
Our son...

03:43.674 --> 03:45.468
is wounded.

03:47.011 --> 03:48.429
Let me see.

03:48.512 --> 03:50.932
A scar that will always
remind me of Wuchang...

03:51.015 --> 03:54.143
and the men and horses that died 
there. That is the only wound.

03:54.227 --> 03:55.937
It too will fade.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.189
Empress, please.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.815
Go to the healer...

04:01.317 --> 04:03.527
Immediately.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.580
You will ride to Karakorum...
pay a visit to Ariq.

04:14.663 --> 04:17.166
I want to know why my brother
pledged horse and bow,

04:17.250 --> 04:19.877
but did not arrive to support my army.

04:20.503 --> 04:21.587
A horse messenger can cover 300...

04:21.670 --> 04:24.173
Your horse messenger...

04:25.508 --> 04:28.677
did a fine job at Wuchang. Did he not?

04:30.221 --> 04:32.348
Did you even send a falcon to my brother?

04:32.431 --> 04:35.226
Of course I did.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.852
Return to me the truth.

04:39.605 --> 04:42.525
Go see the healer, as
your mother instructed.

04:53.702 --> 04:55.663
How are the merchants taxed?

04:55.746 --> 04:57.581
They pay a fee for their stalls,

04:57.665 --> 05:01.044
and the higher fee is for
more traffic, more customers.

05:01.127 --> 05:02.545
More money, eh?

05:02.628 --> 05:04.463
Are there ever holdouts?

05:04.547 --> 05:06.757
Inside the Imperial Wall?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.967
Very rare.

05:09.052 --> 05:10.719
Too good a thing they have here.

05:10.803 --> 05:13.181
These vendors know,
they cheat on tribute,

05:13.264 --> 05:15.849
they end up peddling outside the wall.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.852
In Venice, those who do not meet
their obligations are imprisoned.

05:18.936 --> 05:20.313
Is it the same here?

05:20.396 --> 05:23.774
No, no, no. Thieves are branded thieves.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.943
Marked, they struggle.

05:26.027 --> 05:29.113
Their sons beg, their wives
and daughters whore.

05:29.197 --> 05:31.407
They live off Lady
Chabi's charity loaves.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.867
But they live.

05:33.951 --> 05:35.286
Sometimes.

05:36.662 --> 05:40.458
Severity of punishment...
not for me to comment on.

05:40.541 --> 05:45.713
This is for the Vice Regent Yusuf,
and the wisdom of his Secretariat.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.049
What is this fabric?

05:49.133 --> 05:50.343
Uh, linen.

05:50.426 --> 05:52.553
These Jurchen make it in Manchuria.

05:52.636 --> 05:54.430
They don't have copper
coins to pay this month.

05:54.513 --> 05:56.515
So, I let them pay with what they have.

06:07.151 --> 06:08.527
Hey. Hey.

06:08.611 --> 06:12.115
Can we get rid of these... pissants?

06:12.198 --> 06:14.158
These are my children.

06:15.993 --> 06:17.536
They follow me around like I'm a king.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.288
King of a fine brood, sir.

06:19.372 --> 06:23.417
With my own Venetian slave, huh?
Pissants!

06:24.710 --> 06:26.545
I love that!

06:30.466 --> 06:32.551
Let me put this away.

06:32.635 --> 06:35.179
Thank you for dinner. It was delicious.

06:36.514 --> 06:37.848
Spices?

06:37.931 --> 06:40.726
You wanna talk about spices?

06:40.809 --> 06:41.935
These spiceries pay

06:42.019 --> 06:44.813
three and a third percent.

06:44.897 --> 06:46.732
From the wine they make of the rice...

06:47.733 --> 06:50.403
they generate great revenue.

06:50.486 --> 06:52.196
Thus, they must pay duty.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.283
Untold money to the Khan!

06:56.825 --> 06:57.826
What is that, Sanga?

06:57.910 --> 06:59.036
Huh?

07:09.004 --> 07:10.506
This, Marco...

07:10.589 --> 07:13.008
they're verses of love.

07:13.091 --> 07:15.928
See, I travel to collect.

07:16.011 --> 07:17.138
So, when I travel...

07:17.221 --> 07:21.225
I leave words of love
on paper for my Goland.

07:21.309 --> 07:22.768
So she remembers she has a husband!

07:25.688 --> 07:29.317
And the Silk Road? Do we ever
travel there to collect taxes?

07:30.776 --> 07:32.695
"We"? No.

07:32.778 --> 07:36.114
I travel to collect.
Once a fortnight or so.

07:36.199 --> 07:37.200
You...

07:37.283 --> 07:40.744
are not permitted to travel
outside of Cambulac.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.288
Hmm?

07:42.371 --> 07:45.249
The wonders of Khan's City is plenty.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.375
Hmm?

07:46.459 --> 07:47.543
So, please...

07:47.626 --> 07:50.754
don't speak of this again...
because I like you.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.548
My slave.

07:52.631 --> 07:54.091
Salute!

08:03.434 --> 08:06.103
Noble Tiger traveled a great distance...

08:06.187 --> 08:08.772
and began to find his eyes growing heavy.

08:09.815 --> 08:13.944
Noble Tiger was very sleepy, you see...

08:14.027 --> 08:16.864
for he was very old.

08:16.947 --> 08:18.782
Did he have no more teeth?

08:18.866 --> 08:21.827
He still had teeth...

08:21.910 --> 08:24.747
just no longer sharp.

08:24.830 --> 08:29.877
And so, Noble Tiger lay himself
under a great banyan tree...

08:29.960 --> 08:32.755
and fell into a deep slumber.

08:32.837 --> 08:38.344
He had the most beautiful
dream of a long shady path.

08:38.427 --> 08:42.390
And as he walked down it...

08:42.472 --> 08:46.184
he grew young again and
began a life anew.

08:47.936 --> 08:50.273
So, he slept forever?

08:52.316 --> 08:54.652
Yes.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.822
But all of his friends in the
forest were so happy for him.

08:58.906 --> 09:03.577
Then they remembered all the
treasures he left behind.

09:03.661 --> 09:07.248
You, Ling Ling, are the sweetest...

09:07.331 --> 09:11.294
greatest treasure your
father ever gifted me.

09:11.377 --> 09:15.548
One I will selfishly hoard forever.

09:15.631 --> 09:17.383
Hello, Sunflower.

09:17.883 --> 09:19.051
Uncle!

09:20.177 --> 09:23.889
Uncle's most precious. Born
in the Year of the Monkey.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.391
Oh.

09:25.474 --> 09:29.102
That's why you're so clever.
Precious and clever.

09:29.186 --> 09:30.938
Go. Show the children your new gift.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.861
The Emperor is breathing his last

09:37.945 --> 09:41.198
and he has requested the presence
of his imperial consort.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.285
It is a tragedy that the
fates will not allow him

09:44.368 --> 09:47.496
the time to bear witness to
the fall of Kublai Khan.

09:47.580 --> 09:51.334
Perhaps the Goddess of Mercy is
sparing him a far worse vision.

09:54.920 --> 09:59.425
Men will one day sing
songs about me, sister.

09:59.508 --> 10:02.511
Jia Sidao, the prime minister
who vanquished the demon

10:02.595 --> 10:04.555
and saved the Song.

10:05.848 --> 10:08.559
I will bring my daughter to
say goodbye to her father...

10:09.935 --> 10:11.479
and to the Empire.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.538
I did not mean to startle you.

11:52.621 --> 11:55.290
- Are you following me?
- No.

11:55.373 --> 11:57.960
I saw you and approached.

12:01.547 --> 12:03.048
What are you doing out here?

12:04.758 --> 12:06.134
I might ask you the same.

12:07.010 --> 12:08.428
There is no citizen of Cambulac

12:08.512 --> 12:11.014
foolish enough to look at,
let alone talk to me.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.600
Do you know who I am?

12:14.226 --> 12:16.061
I know only your protector.

12:16.144 --> 12:18.313
And if Za Bing were to catch
you anywhere near me...

12:18.396 --> 12:19.690
he would run you through.

12:21.859 --> 12:23.819
I trust you will not report me.

12:29.492 --> 12:31.494
So... who are you?

12:33.036 --> 12:35.831
I am the Blue Princess
of the Bayaut tribe.

12:35.914 --> 12:39.167
You ride as Mongol... not princess.

12:39.251 --> 12:42.462
All Mongol women are born
to the horse and the bow.

12:44.507 --> 12:45.549
May I assist you?

12:45.633 --> 12:47.593
No.

12:47.676 --> 12:49.302
I am simply being polite.

12:49.386 --> 12:52.515
Something a noble woman such as
yourself should be tutored in.

12:52.598 --> 12:54.767
I need not be polite to someone like you.

12:54.850 --> 12:57.019
Someone like me?

12:57.102 --> 12:58.854
Someone beneath me.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.862
I will forgive your ignorance
in the ways of your new home.

13:06.945 --> 13:08.196
This is not my home.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.533
Many before you have thought the same.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.994
You speak from experience.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.496
Why do you imagine that?

13:16.580 --> 13:19.416
I see behind your words.

13:19.499 --> 13:23.420
If you are the Princess of the Bayaut...
where is your Queen?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.505
Your King?

13:26.632 --> 13:28.926
You're a prisoner...

13:29.009 --> 13:31.136
like me.

13:32.846 --> 13:36.850
I am kept for royalty. My future
is in some distant palace.

13:36.934 --> 13:39.436
You are a slave of the Khan.

13:41.438 --> 13:43.732
I am nothing like you.

14:00.749 --> 14:02.626
Try to keep up, if you can.

15:06.732 --> 15:10.861
It won't be you who gets
cattle-branded, Princess.

16:02.204 --> 16:05.040
You've been particularly busy of late.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.961
How goes your horse riding?

16:11.672 --> 16:14.424
You hold your tongue from me again? Hmm?

16:15.383 --> 16:18.220
How shall I tell of the
Mongolian pony, Sire?

16:18.303 --> 16:20.889
He is a fine and hardy breed.

16:20.973 --> 16:26.478
Unlike some steeds in Europe... he
needs not rest nor... coddling.

16:26.561 --> 16:28.188
Good.

16:28.271 --> 16:31.024
Because you ride to Karakorum
today with my son Jingim.

16:31.108 --> 16:34.737
Bring me back a report, with fresh eyes.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.196
Let me see, Latin...

16:37.114 --> 16:39.742
the way things truly are in
the kingdom of my brother.

16:40.658 --> 16:42.535
By your will, Sire.

17:50.728 --> 17:51.855
My nephew.

17:51.939 --> 17:53.231
Uncle.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.110
I'm honored that my older
brother has sent you.

17:57.194 --> 17:58.821
We will kill a sheep...

17:58.904 --> 18:00.030
and drink airag.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.782
Come.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.166
You're in the heartland
of Lord Genghis now.

18:11.249 --> 18:16.546
Beware, Polo. Your words
can get you killed.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.590
Wait out here.

18:24.762 --> 18:27.474
This one they call the
"Cricket Minister..."

18:27.557 --> 18:30.435
how many soldiers did he have
lying in wait at Wuchang?

18:30.518 --> 18:32.145
Not enough to defeat a Mongol army...

18:32.229 --> 18:35.232
had our reinforcements arrived.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.942
You did not attack without me?

18:37.025 --> 18:39.194
I was almost killed!

18:39.277 --> 18:42.990
My general, Aruka, has
passed to the Blue Sky!

18:43.073 --> 18:45.492
The rains cut off passage
of the Blue Horde.

18:45.575 --> 18:46.827
You should have sent word.

18:46.910 --> 18:49.079
I did.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.249
My best rider... Duwa.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.792
They captured him outside of Wuchang.

18:54.877 --> 18:57.337
Tied his head to his horse...

18:57.420 --> 18:59.047
let it run home.

18:59.131 --> 19:01.758
Right to his ger...

19:01.842 --> 19:03.385
and his children.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.043
May I see?

19:42.215 --> 19:45.343
They are... magnificent beasts.

20:07.615 --> 20:10.911
When you were a child,
I called you Altai.

20:12.620 --> 20:17.792
After the mountains me and
your father hunted as boys.

20:17.875 --> 20:22.172
Kublai insisted on a 
Chinese name. Jingim.

20:25.717 --> 20:27.970
Remind me of its meaning.

20:28.971 --> 20:29.972
Golden.

20:31.139 --> 20:32.224
Golden.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.727
You are his golden one, nephew.

20:36.728 --> 20:41.233
One day, they may call you...
"Jingim Khan."

20:42.817 --> 20:44.069
But beware...

20:45.487 --> 20:49.824
my big brother is too
trusting of outsiders.

20:49.907 --> 20:53.703
Persians... and Chinese...

20:53.786 --> 20:55.998
and all kinds of religions.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.251
You and me...

20:59.334 --> 21:03.255
our blood is the wolf and the deer.

21:03.338 --> 21:07.175
Open the gates to outsiders...
secrets will they spill.

21:15.308 --> 21:18.186
Who is the Christian who rides with you?

22:02.230 --> 22:04.816
My uncle's troops were cut
off by the spring rains...

22:04.899 --> 22:06.526
east of Volga.

22:06.609 --> 22:07.777
He sent a horse messenger...

22:07.860 --> 22:09.696
but the rebels intercepted.

22:13.491 --> 22:15.285
Where is the Latin?

22:17.620 --> 22:19.081
Sire?

22:25.170 --> 22:27.339
What was your impression
of the Old Capital?

22:29.174 --> 22:31.759
I found the Great Khan's
brother to be a gracious host,

22:31.843 --> 22:33.428
as Prince Jingim reported.

22:36.514 --> 22:37.599
Four wives, yes?

22:37.682 --> 22:41.894
Five. He also keeps a large harem...

22:41.978 --> 22:43.480
quite young.

22:44.939 --> 22:46.608
But not as vast as mine.

22:46.691 --> 22:49.068
And nowhere near as charming.

22:49.152 --> 22:51.028
Certainly no girls from Kungurat.

22:57.119 --> 23:00.788
I have seen my uncle's army, Father.

23:00.872 --> 23:02.165
They are ready.

23:02.665 --> 23:05.835
Ariq is prepared to join
our attack on Xiangyang.

23:05.918 --> 23:09.172
This will not be another Wuchang.

23:15.262 --> 23:18.181
I fear Ariq's horses will
never reach Xiangyang.

23:24.020 --> 23:25.188
Speak.

23:28.024 --> 23:30.777
Ariq's horses are in the
many thousands, true.

23:30.860 --> 23:32.904
Quite fit.

23:32.987 --> 23:36.616
But how many days' ride is it from
the Old Capital to the Walled City?

23:37.700 --> 23:40.287
Three weeks. By desert.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.044
As the son of a merchant...

23:48.127 --> 23:51.589
they do not have the grain supplies to
move that many horses to Xiangyang.

23:52.507 --> 23:56.303
The desert alone would cut
their numbers in half.

23:56.386 --> 24:00.682
My son, Jingim, just stated that
they are ready to ride into battle.

24:00.765 --> 24:03.893
They are ready, yes, Great Khan.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.854
But only if that battle
was closer to home.

24:09.191 --> 24:10.775
Do you accuse my uncle,

24:10.858 --> 24:12.985
brother to the Khan, of treason?

24:13.903 --> 24:17.490
I only describe what I see, as I saw it.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.840
Yusuf...

24:33.923 --> 24:37.469
dispatch a night rider to
verify the Latin's report.

25:01.033 --> 25:05.330
You will not be gaining favors by
your charming stories anymore.

25:06.914 --> 25:08.708
Not without a tongue.

25:52.419 --> 25:54.462
The sword you hid is weak.

25:54.546 --> 25:57.924
Your water won't last you two days.

25:58.007 --> 26:01.177
But the salt cakes were... delicious.

26:04.806 --> 26:06.974
I called Ariq a liar tonight.

26:07.058 --> 26:10.144
That was foolish. Were your words true?

26:10.227 --> 26:11.854
Yes.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.023
Run now, they will find you.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.650
Stay...

26:15.733 --> 26:19.236
I can train you to survive in whatever
world you choose to make your home.

26:19.321 --> 26:21.280
This is not my home.

26:21.364 --> 26:22.949
I understand.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.494
Where did the Khan get you from?

26:27.954 --> 26:29.414
I said I would train you...

26:30.373 --> 26:34.293
not wallow in nostalgia with you.

27:35.563 --> 27:37.899
Why do you think the sword
has a colored sash?

27:38.900 --> 27:40.234
To look pretty?

27:52.455 --> 27:55.082
He's advanced quickly to the broadsword.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.712
You schooled him well, Hundred Eyes.

28:01.213 --> 28:04.634
May I interrupt the student's
training for a word?

28:04.717 --> 28:07.762
You're the Prince. You may kill
him, if that's your desire.

28:18.022 --> 28:21.901
Humiliate me in front
of the court again...

28:21.984 --> 28:23.736
I will kill you.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.081
You were right.

28:36.833 --> 28:38.418
Ariq betrayed us.

28:53.725 --> 28:57.394
Ariq sends me a treacherous gift.

28:57.479 --> 29:01.065
He remembers how much I love
the king of the hunters.

29:01.148 --> 29:04.777
Ariq is a dog, that would
eat its own afterbirth.

29:06.571 --> 29:10.825
He has always believed that he
should be Khan of Khans. Not you.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.580
Before the sun sets today...

29:15.663 --> 29:18.875
I will close down the
Gobi trade routes...

29:18.958 --> 29:21.753
starve Karakorum.

29:21.836 --> 29:25.465
My younger brother will have
no place to go but Siberia.

29:25.548 --> 29:28.300
So forgiving, Great Kublai.

29:28.384 --> 29:33.473
You slaughter entire cities, yet
you allow Ariq to run to Siberia.

29:33.556 --> 29:35.141
I know how to punish my brother.

29:35.224 --> 29:37.351
He almost killed your son.

29:38.936 --> 29:41.939
Ariq believes he can pleasure
your women better than you.

29:43.274 --> 29:45.151
Does that excite you, Empress?

29:45.234 --> 29:49.071
Ariq should be trampled by 1,000 horses

29:49.155 --> 29:51.699
and left on a steppe to rot.

29:55.244 --> 29:58.873
That... would excite me.

30:36.786 --> 30:38.370
Ariq Khan?

30:38.454 --> 30:39.914
Kublai's younger brother in the north.

30:39.997 --> 30:43.668
We are minting his own currency for
when he is elected Khan of Khans

30:43.751 --> 30:46.128
and opens the Silk Road for the Song.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.631
Of course, I need the support
of our region's governors.

30:53.385 --> 30:56.055
You have my stamp, Sidao.

30:58.558 --> 31:01.894
And my command over the Council.

31:21.581 --> 31:24.834
Men grow old, pearls turn yellow...

31:24.917 --> 31:27.169
there is no cure.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.421
My condolences, Empress Xie.

31:30.464 --> 31:34.510
Eventually, we all become
white ashes, Sidao.

31:34.594 --> 31:38.139
But my husband has left a son.

31:38.222 --> 31:41.684
Bow to your new Emperor, Zhao Xian.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.906
With sad news, Empress, also comes good.

31:54.989 --> 31:58.159
We drove the Mongols back from Wuchang.

31:58.242 --> 32:00.202
The barbarians know your Chancellor

32:00.286 --> 32:04.040
will never surrender the last
stronghold of the Song dynasty.

32:04.707 --> 32:07.960
But they will be back.
We can count on that.

32:08.044 --> 32:11.338
I fear you do count on it, Sidao.

32:11.422 --> 32:14.050
I fear you thirst for it.

32:44.664 --> 32:45.915
Have you reported all?

32:45.998 --> 32:48.668
Yes, Good Minister Ahmad. Yes.

32:50.878 --> 32:52.338
You are dismissed, Sanga.

32:56.133 --> 32:57.426
Master Marco.

32:58.385 --> 33:01.848
Come. Stay.

33:01.931 --> 33:04.516
Goodbye, my Venetian slave.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.728
Schiavo. Huh?

33:08.270 --> 33:09.438
So...

33:09.521 --> 33:11.648
what is this gift I hear of?

33:11.733 --> 33:15.277
The foreign messenger who can
paint pictures with his words.

33:15.361 --> 33:18.530
How would you describe
the manner in which...

33:18.614 --> 33:19.949
the Uighurs pay their taxes?

33:20.908 --> 33:24.370
Always there's a form of ceremony.

33:24.453 --> 33:26.956
On their knees...

33:27.039 --> 33:30.542
a humble offering, more as
to a god than to a king.

33:30.626 --> 33:32.461
And the Jurchens?

33:32.544 --> 33:34.964
Clever, and a resourceful people.

33:35.047 --> 33:38.843
Paying with the work of their hands
when they do not have the coins.

33:38.926 --> 33:42.138
Masters of making linen, I understand.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.473
So if the Jurchens have
been paying in linen,

33:44.556 --> 33:47.268
why hasn't Sanga deposited
any such tribute?

33:50.687 --> 33:53.983
I did not say that Sanga
collected such linens.

33:54.066 --> 33:58.445
Only that the Jurchens are a
clever and resourceful people.

34:00.156 --> 34:02.324
You are not the first foreigner...

34:02.408 --> 34:05.411
who has had to learn to
subsist in this kingdom.

34:05.494 --> 34:08.371
I found my way here as a child...

34:08.455 --> 34:12.001
raised in the household
of the Great Khan.

34:12.083 --> 34:16.713
So I know his heart,
and I have his trust.

34:16.797 --> 34:21.427
A lie is... like an assault
on his person, but...

34:21.510 --> 34:24.596
an honest word? That is like a shield.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.059
So I must ask you again.

34:28.141 --> 34:29.476
Did the Jurchens...

34:29.560 --> 34:34.606
at any time... pay their
taxes in the form of linen?

34:36.650 --> 34:39.152
Perhaps Sanga simply forgot.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.949
Indeed.

35:21.695 --> 35:24.866
Ling Ling... Ling Ling, go with Jing Fei.

35:26.951 --> 35:28.995
Come on. Good girl.

35:31.622 --> 35:34.291
I will see you very soon, my daughter.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.134
My Emperor is dead...

35:44.551 --> 35:47.513
but I am still an imperial consort.

35:52.059 --> 35:54.436
I do not bed soldiers.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.065
Chancellor Jia Sidao has
granted us permission.

36:23.925 --> 36:27.303
Two Eels, One Cave.

36:35.852 --> 36:38.105
Do you know this forbidden game?

38:05.484 --> 38:09.363
You should be tied to a post and have
your skin sliced from your body.

38:09.446 --> 38:12.324
I have bartered for your
political advantage.

38:12.408 --> 38:15.161
I will not barter for the
loyalty of your soldiers.

38:15.244 --> 38:16.453
It is beneath you...

38:16.537 --> 38:17.913
I know.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.625
You will travel to Cambulac as defector.

38:22.584 --> 38:23.877
They will take you in,

38:23.960 --> 38:26.047
and just as you won the favor
of the Emperor of China...

38:26.130 --> 38:28.840
you will win the favor
of the Devil himself.

38:28.924 --> 38:30.801
Report to me.

38:30.884 --> 38:33.554
Everything he says, everything
he does, everything he dreams.

38:40.269 --> 38:41.645
Do not worry, sister.

38:42.146 --> 38:43.605
While you are away...

38:43.689 --> 38:46.733
I will personally care for my Sunflower.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.111
I am your blood.

38:49.195 --> 38:51.322
We give our blood for the dynasty.

38:52.114 --> 38:55.117
Your men... they laugh at you.

38:55.201 --> 38:57.369
They call you the "Cricket Minister."

39:08.255 --> 39:10.466
I was summoned.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.633
Quiet.

39:14.595 --> 39:15.971
You may begin.

39:28.109 --> 39:31.570
The tax collector's
deposits did not match.

39:31.653 --> 39:32.738
What?

39:47.544 --> 39:49.255
He was given an honorable death.

39:50.256 --> 39:54.551
Rolled up in a carpet so that Tengri
the Sky God did not see his blood.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.183
You will be riding into
battle with us, I hear...

40:01.267 --> 40:03.685
to give your accounts.

40:16.865 --> 40:20.202
I love you so much. I have to go.

40:20.286 --> 40:22.037
But I will see you very soon.

40:22.121 --> 40:23.705
I love you.

42:26.161 --> 42:28.163
Send for Ariq.

42:29.373 --> 42:33.460
Put up a ger. Light a fire.

43:14.209 --> 43:16.169
Do you remember, older brother...

43:16.252 --> 43:18.964
the summer you chased
a deer for six days?

43:19.047 --> 43:22.551
You were gone so long, our mother
thought the wolves got you.

43:22.634 --> 43:25.554
She made me grind borts with
the women for six more days.

43:27.723 --> 43:30.392
Our father woke up drunk and said,

43:30.476 --> 43:33.437
"Kublai, why are you
grinding borts like a girl,

43:33.520 --> 43:35.981
when you should be out hunting deer?"

43:38.233 --> 43:39.610
Sorkaktani...

43:41.152 --> 43:42.613
she was a fine mother.

43:44.823 --> 43:48.034
A great mother. Queen of Mongolia.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.544
It was she who taught us the code
of Grandfather Genghis, yes?

43:57.628 --> 44:00.005
It was she that taught
us that a true ruler

44:00.088 --> 44:03.342
must not lose the loyalty
of his allies and subjects.

44:04.343 --> 44:09.097
The Chinese... Saracen...
Christian or Hindi.

44:09.931 --> 44:13.435
A wise leader allows
his people their ways.

44:13.519 --> 44:14.645
Our father...

44:14.728 --> 44:17.689
son of Genghis, did not
agree with such open gates.

44:17.773 --> 44:21.151
He drank himself to death.
Behind closed doors.

44:23.695 --> 44:26.823
Do you know where I was those six days?

44:26.907 --> 44:28.992
When you were chasing that deer?

44:30.411 --> 44:32.037
Making my arrows sharp

44:32.120 --> 44:35.916
to go after the wolf and save my brother.

44:35.999 --> 44:38.209
I was four years old.

44:38.919 --> 44:41.422
When our brother, Mongke, died...

44:41.505 --> 44:44.550
Mongolia elected me Khan of Khans.

44:44.633 --> 44:49.680
Not all of Mongolia, brother. Not
the Princes of the Golden Horde.

44:49.763 --> 44:53.099
- Not the Chagataid of Persia.
- That is rebellion.

44:58.271 --> 45:00.273
We can argue that all night.

45:01.567 --> 45:03.652
I do not want to be Emperor of China.

45:04.611 --> 45:08.073
I do not want to be Ruler
of the Face of the Earth.

45:08.156 --> 45:10.576
I want to be Khan of Mongolia.

45:10.659 --> 45:12.786
They are one and the same, brother.

45:14.705 --> 45:17.708
So... it has come to this?

45:18.500 --> 45:21.377
Not by my choosing.

45:23.797 --> 45:24.965
The way I see it,

45:25.048 --> 45:27.926
it is your warriors
setting camp on my land.

45:29.135 --> 45:31.096
It's because of that point of view...

45:31.179 --> 45:34.349
my warriors set camp on my land.

45:53.159 --> 45:55.286
I bid you a good night's rest.

45:57.122 --> 46:00.041
I'll see you at sunrise.

46:48.464 --> 46:52.719
Where do you think the Venetian
merchant is this evening?

46:55.722 --> 46:58.058
India? Tabriz?

47:01.144 --> 47:04.522
On my Silk Road, chasing riches.

47:07.025 --> 47:09.611
I was just about your age when I knew.

47:11.655 --> 47:13.574
Knew what, Sire?

47:13.657 --> 47:17.493
That I had to become the man
I wished my father was.

47:22.373 --> 47:23.792
Tomorrow...

47:25.001 --> 47:27.295
watch and remember what you see.

47:30.090 --> 47:31.507
Faithfully.

49:15.946 --> 49:17.447
Tell me.

49:18.740 --> 49:24.204
All the way to the horizon.
A sea of men and horses.

49:24.287 --> 49:26.915
Ready to break ashore.

49:28.208 --> 49:31.294
The Khan has moved from
his guard to the front.

49:34.089 --> 49:35.090
Yes.

50:43.074 --> 50:44.534
What is he doing now?

50:45.994 --> 50:47.495
He is riding down.

50:48.663 --> 50:49.915
Alone.

50:49.998 --> 50:52.292
This is Mongol against Mongol.

50:52.375 --> 50:54.335
And only one can win.

50:56.254 --> 50:58.173
You best pray that it is our side.

50:59.925 --> 51:01.217
For if we lose...

51:01.301 --> 51:03.428
Cambulac will be burned to the ground...

51:03.511 --> 51:06.389
and we will be made into kindling.

51:36.127 --> 51:38.296
Look where it has ended, brother.

51:39.505 --> 51:41.883
You want Mongolia...

51:41.967 --> 51:43.509
you come and take it.

51:45.178 --> 51:46.512
It is...

51:47.430 --> 51:48.849
as it should be.

55:18.474 --> 55:20.351
Men of Karakorum!

55:21.394 --> 55:22.937
It is over!

55:23.020 --> 55:24.230
This fight...

55:24.314 --> 55:28.401
between Mongols is done!

55:29.944 --> 55:31.654
We stand together now!

55:32.655 --> 55:34.365
We ride together!

55:36.409 --> 55:39.579
Every corner of the land
beneath this Blue Sky,

55:39.662 --> 55:42.415
is ours for the taking!

55:43.499 --> 55:45.751
Go back to Karakorum.

55:45.835 --> 55:48.254
Prepare for war!

55:49.172 --> 55:53.343
For soon, we ride toward the south.
