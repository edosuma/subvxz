WEBVTT

00:06.629 --> 00:08.363
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

00:08.365 --> 00:10.131
make no mistake about it.

00:10.133 --> 00:13.635
Sean Wallace is
a gang-affiliated criminal

00:13.637 --> 00:16.938
who only cares about himself
and his fellow street thugs.

00:16.940 --> 00:19.207
Sure, it's breaking
and entering now,

00:19.209 --> 00:21.009
but what's it
going to be next?

00:21.011 --> 00:22.777
First-degree murder?

00:22.779 --> 00:25.814
Your Honor, I believe
that the pursuit of justice

00:25.816 --> 00:27.916
is never a waste of time.

00:27.918 --> 00:29.651
But in this case,
there's no question,

00:29.653 --> 00:32.487
that man is guilty.

00:32.488 --> 00:35.356
The prosecution rests.

00:37.226 --> 00:39.928
Do me a favor. Um...

00:41.597 --> 00:43.331
Close your eyes
for a moment.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.567
Go ahead.

00:45.569 --> 00:48.369
Now, I want you to erase
the image in your head

00:48.371 --> 00:49.370
that you have
of my client.

00:49.372 --> 00:54.442
Now, imagine an 8-year-old
Sean Wallace.

00:54.444 --> 00:55.977
He's scared and alone.

00:55.979 --> 00:58.646
Starving for love
and attention.

00:58.648 --> 01:02.683
Now, I know you're thinking,
where's his family?

01:02.685 --> 01:05.820
Well, let's start
with his mother.

01:05.822 --> 01:08.289
A local prostitute
who spends most of her time

01:08.291 --> 01:10.224
either in bed with strangers

01:10.226 --> 01:11.893
or shooting up drugs.

01:11.895 --> 01:14.061
Then there's
his abusive father,

01:14.063 --> 01:16.364
currently serving
25 to life.

01:16.366 --> 01:18.533
And finally,
the aunts and uncles

01:18.535 --> 01:21.936
who only saw Sean
as a monthly paycheck.

01:21.938 --> 01:26.507
So, with no other
place to go...

01:26.509 --> 01:31.479
Sean turned to his peers
on the streets.

01:31.481 --> 01:34.215
You can open your eyes now.

01:34.217 --> 01:35.483
It's true,

01:35.485 --> 01:37.685
Sean fell victim
to the gang community,

01:37.687 --> 01:39.687
but it was not because
he wanted to.

01:39.689 --> 01:41.388
It was because they were
the only family

01:41.390 --> 01:43.457
that he'd ever known.

01:43.459 --> 01:46.794
Ladies and gentlemen, instead of pushing
this young man further away,

01:46.796 --> 01:49.997
let's do what every
loving parent would do.

01:49.999 --> 01:52.333
Let's help.

01:52.335 --> 01:55.669
I urge you to impose probation
and community service

01:55.671 --> 01:57.371
in lieu of jail time.

01:57.373 --> 02:01.642
Let's--let's stretch out
our hands, as it were,

02:01.644 --> 02:04.912
and help this young man
to his feet.

02:08.449 --> 02:09.983
Defense rests.

02:11.553 --> 02:14.988
The jurors can retire to the jury room
and begin deliberating.

02:14.990 --> 02:17.858
Court is adjourned.

02:20.161 --> 02:22.062
So what do you think
my chances are?

02:22.064 --> 02:26.033
Well, how many of the jurors
smiled at you?

02:26.035 --> 02:28.602
Like...4, maybe.

02:30.305 --> 02:32.906
Then I'd say
they're pretty good.

02:37.645 --> 02:39.112
Yeah, I thought I could
get out early,

02:39.114 --> 02:40.847
but I just got caught up
in some paperwork.

02:40.849 --> 02:42.749
So, anyway, I'm heading
to the car now.

02:42.751 --> 02:44.518
Be home soon. Love you.

02:48.689 --> 02:50.757
What the hell are you--
that's my car!

02:52.026 --> 02:54.461
What the hell are you doing?!

02:54.463 --> 02:56.363
I'm calling the cops.

02:56.365 --> 02:58.164
911. What's
your emergency?

02:58.166 --> 03:00.700
Yeah, there's a guy
smashing up my car.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.802
What's your name, sir?

03:02.804 --> 03:04.004
Sir, what's your name?

03:04.006 --> 03:05.839
Uh, Jack Westbrook.

03:05.841 --> 03:06.906
And where are you
right now?

03:06.908 --> 03:09.843
I'm outside Marty's
near Vernon.

03:09.845 --> 03:11.344
Wait a minute,
he's running away.

03:11.346 --> 03:12.412
Sir, stay where you are.

03:12.414 --> 03:13.380
Hey!

03:13.382 --> 03:15.849
Mr. Westbrook,
do not pursue.

03:15.851 --> 03:17.317
Do not follow him.

03:21.188 --> 03:22.822
Sir.

03:22.824 --> 03:24.724
Sir,
are you still there?

03:26.727 --> 03:27.961
Hello?

03:27.963 --> 03:29.362
Mr. Westbrook?

03:29.364 --> 03:31.598
Yeah, I'm--I'm here.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.299
Officers have been
dispatched.

03:33.301 --> 03:35.001
Uhh! Uhh!

03:35.003 --> 03:36.202
Sir?

03:36.204 --> 03:38.304
Help is on the way.

03:40.007 --> 03:41.007
Oh, there you are.

03:41.009 --> 03:42.608
I'm sorry.
The traffic was horrible.

03:42.610 --> 03:43.711
Chris had a double shift.

03:43.735 --> 03:44.778
Megan needed to be dropped
at a friend's.

03:44.779 --> 03:46.512
Hotch said we're dealing
with an abduction?

03:46.514 --> 03:48.448
Sadly, yes.
12:34 this morning.

03:48.450 --> 03:50.450
Boston defense attorney
Jack Westbrook was abducted

03:50.452 --> 03:51.951
from a convenience
store parking lot.

03:51.953 --> 03:53.453
That's precise.
Who called it in?

03:53.455 --> 03:55.988
He did. He was on the phone
with the 911 operator

03:55.990 --> 03:57.123
when he was taken.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.491
Cute shoes.
Hey, thank you.

03:58.493 --> 04:01.227
Sir,
sir, are you still there?

04:01.229 --> 04:04.330
Hello? Mr. Westbrook?

04:04.332 --> 04:05.965
Yeah, I'm--I'm here.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.466
Officers have been
dispatched.

04:07.468 --> 04:08.968
Uhh!
Sir?

04:08.970 --> 04:10.403
Did you just hear that?

04:10.405 --> 04:12.805
Garcia, can you enhance
the audio at the end?

04:12.807 --> 04:14.974
I think I can.
Give me a second.

04:14.976 --> 04:17.043
Uhh!
You got him?

04:17.045 --> 04:19.845
Someone else besides
the unsub was there.

04:19.846 --> 04:21.147
He had a partner.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.681
Have there been
any ransom demands?

04:22.683 --> 04:23.816
No, nothing yet.

04:23.818 --> 04:25.317
This guy's made
a lot of enemies.

04:25.319 --> 04:27.153
He was the lead prosecutor
responsible for putting away

04:27.155 --> 04:28.787
away key members
of the Buccieri family.

04:28.789 --> 04:30.890
It wouldn't be the first time
a convict targeted an attorney.

04:30.892 --> 04:34.293
Just last year in Texas Eric Lyle
Williams killed two prosecutors.

04:34.295 --> 04:36.395
Yeah, according to this,
they weren't all high profile.

04:36.397 --> 04:39.565
He prosecuted or defended everyone
from drunk drivers to gang members.

04:39.567 --> 04:42.101
So basically, half
the criminal population of Boston

04:42.103 --> 04:43.602
could be holding
this guy for ransom.

04:43.604 --> 04:45.270
And the other half could be
victims or family members

04:45.272 --> 04:46.438
of the criminals
he defended.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.407
I hate to be
the odd woman out here,

04:48.409 --> 04:50.943
but isn't it possible
he was just a victim of opportunity?

04:50.945 --> 04:52.611
I mean, he was in
a sketchy area after dark.

04:52.613 --> 04:53.746
True.

04:53.748 --> 04:55.414
But you heard the recording.
The attack on the car

04:55.416 --> 04:58.650
was most likely a ruse to isolate him.
It says target to me.

04:58.652 --> 05:00.119
It's been over 12 hours
since he disappeared.

05:00.121 --> 05:02.588
If the motivation was revenge,
he could already be dead.

05:02.590 --> 05:04.193
Well, unless we have
reason to believe otherwise,

05:04.194 --> 05:05.779
Jack Westbrook is alive.
We need to find him.

05:05.803 --> 05:07.479
Wheels up in 30.

Is anybody there?

05:44.798 --> 05:46.331
I need some help.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.701
I'm down here.

05:54.006 --> 05:55.974
Please, let me out of here.

05:55.976 --> 05:58.176
You ready to come clean?

05:58.178 --> 06:00.845
Come clean? What are you--

06:00.847 --> 06:03.481
you've got the wrong person.

06:03.483 --> 06:06.050
Why are we even listening
to this crap?

06:06.052 --> 06:07.285
We should just kill him.

06:07.287 --> 06:08.586
No, no, no, no.
Please.

06:08.588 --> 06:10.021
Not until we get
his confession.

06:10.023 --> 06:12.624
I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:12.626 --> 06:15.059
Please! Just let me go.

06:15.061 --> 06:17.128
Can't do that,
Mr. Westbrook.

06:17.130 --> 06:19.597
Not after we went through
the trouble of getting you here.

06:19.599 --> 06:24.235
Besides, we're just
getting started.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.822
All right, let's
go over victimology.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.624
Jack Westbrook's life
reads like a practice guide

07:15.627 --> 07:16.926
to being perfect.

07:16.928 --> 07:18.628
Graduated first
in his class.

07:18.630 --> 07:21.564
Went on to be the A.D.A.
in several rural counties.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.267
His marvelous track record
caught the attention of the higher-ups.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.402
Within 6 years he was
in the Boston big leagues.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.105
4 years ago he made a 180,
went from prosecuting criminals

07:29.107 --> 07:30.439
to defending them.
I wonder why.

07:30.441 --> 07:32.875
He may have been tired of dealing
with all the politics.

07:32.877 --> 07:35.311
Or he wanted better pay.
ADA's with his kind of trial experience

07:35.313 --> 07:36.345
are in high demand.

07:36.347 --> 07:38.581
Looks like Jack
isn't all dollar signs.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.750
It says here he worked
with a number of nonprofits

07:40.752 --> 07:44.353
and even took on several
pro Bono cases every year.

07:44.355 --> 07:47.223
He seems to have checked all the boxes
in his personal life, too.

07:47.225 --> 07:49.592
He and his wife Linda
have been married for almost 7 years.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.427
They're expecting
their first child in January.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.296
Did you think I was joking
when I said his life was so pristine?

07:54.298 --> 07:55.765
Mm. Even someone this perfect

07:55.767 --> 07:57.800
is bound to have some
skeletons in the closet.

07:57.802 --> 07:58.801
It says that he and his wife

07:58.803 --> 08:00.336
did a lot of
moving around in the area.

08:00.338 --> 08:02.605
They never stayed in the same place
more than a couple of years.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.440
Well, that makes sense.
Guy seems pretty ambitious.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.909
All the relocating could have been for
better job opportunities.

08:06.911 --> 08:10.045
Yeah, or they feared retaliation from
the people he put away.

08:10.047 --> 08:12.314
Last year alone,
he won 33 of the 35 cases

08:12.316 --> 08:14.416
he defended, giving him
a 94% success rate.

08:14.418 --> 08:16.418
We should concentrate
on the 6%.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.154
He could have made promises
and not delivered.

08:28.231 --> 08:30.098
Agent Hatcher.
Thanks for coming out.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.633
Detective.
This is Agent Jareau.

08:31.635 --> 08:33.101
Welcome. Right this way.

08:33.102 --> 08:34.269
We've got units posted

08:34.270 --> 08:36.270
at both the victim's
workplace and residence.

08:36.273 --> 08:38.106
Brought in some extra
manpower to work the phones

08:38.107 --> 08:40.642
in case these guys try and reach out,
like you suggested.

08:40.644 --> 08:41.610
Good. Thank you.

08:41.611 --> 08:43.611
You and your team
can set up over there.

08:43.613 --> 08:44.645
Is that Mrs. Westbrook?

08:44.648 --> 08:47.516
Hasn't said a word
since she came in.

08:47.518 --> 08:51.086
You know, this type of stress
can't be too good for the baby.

08:51.088 --> 08:54.356
Hopefully she has better luck
than I did.

08:54.358 --> 08:56.692
Linda?

08:56.694 --> 08:57.859
Hi.

08:57.861 --> 08:59.561
I'm Jennifer.
I'm with the FBI.

08:59.563 --> 09:00.796
Hi.

09:00.798 --> 09:02.097
I want to ask you
some questions

09:02.099 --> 09:04.866
about your husband.
Is that all right?

09:04.868 --> 09:06.401
Yeah.

09:06.403 --> 09:07.436
Great.

09:07.438 --> 09:08.737
Um, you know what?

09:08.739 --> 09:11.139
Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private.

09:16.746 --> 09:19.114
Have a seat, please.

09:22.485 --> 09:24.853
Can I get you
something to drink?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.988
No, thank you.

09:29.225 --> 09:32.660
May I ask how far along
you are?

09:32.662 --> 09:35.763
7 months.

09:35.765 --> 09:37.932
A boy.

09:37.934 --> 09:41.269
I have a son. He's 6.

09:41.271 --> 09:44.506
Can you tell me about the last time
you spoke to Jack?

09:44.508 --> 09:46.941
At lunch yesterday.

09:46.943 --> 09:49.978
I missed his call
last night.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.248
He said he'd gotten
caught up with paperwork.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.484
Had he always worked
long hours?

09:56.486 --> 09:58.252
For the most part.

09:58.254 --> 10:01.823
I read that the two of you
moved around the area a lot. Why?

10:01.825 --> 10:05.126
His job used to make him
paranoid.

10:05.128 --> 10:07.462
I can't tell you
how many times

10:07.464 --> 10:09.297
he changed
his phone number.

10:09.299 --> 10:12.166
But once he got
the new job...

10:12.168 --> 10:13.835
things were different.

10:13.837 --> 10:15.202
How so?

10:15.204 --> 10:19.307
Well, for the first time
he wasn't looking over his shoulder.

10:19.309 --> 10:23.244
He was defending
the underdog.

10:23.246 --> 10:28.015
We--we finally
settled down...

10:28.017 --> 10:29.950
And bought a house.

10:32.788 --> 10:36.590
And that's when we decided
to start a family. I'm sorry.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.759
Hey, it's ok.
I know,

10:38.761 --> 10:42.029
this is very hard. Ok?

10:42.031 --> 10:44.098
Your husband's last purchase

10:44.100 --> 10:45.699
was from a convenience store.

10:45.701 --> 10:46.834
He bought flowers.

10:46.836 --> 10:50.204
Were the two of you
celebrating something?

10:50.206 --> 10:51.472
He won.

10:51.474 --> 10:54.775
Whenever Jack
won a case,

10:54.777 --> 10:56.944
he brought me flowers.

10:59.781 --> 11:01.749
It was his way
of thanking me

11:01.751 --> 11:04.051
for dealing with
the long hours.

11:04.053 --> 11:06.020
Please,

11:06.022 --> 11:07.721
please find my husband.

11:07.723 --> 11:09.423
Please.

11:09.425 --> 11:15.195
Look, whatever I did
to you in court, I'm sorry.

11:16.297 --> 11:17.998
I know the system
isn't fair.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.100
I was just doing my job.

11:22.103 --> 11:24.037
Please, just...

11:24.039 --> 11:26.907
Tell me what you want.

11:27.809 --> 11:30.110
Whatever trouble you're in,

11:30.112 --> 11:31.812
you know, I can help.

11:31.814 --> 11:35.882
Let's just talk this
through. I can fix this.

11:37.685 --> 11:41.021
You really have no idea,
do you?

11:41.856 --> 11:43.857
No!

11:43.859 --> 11:47.994
No!

11:49.664 --> 11:52.299
Just tell me--
tell me what it is you want.

11:52.301 --> 11:53.301
Is it money?

11:53.302 --> 11:55.335
Is that what
this is about?

11:55.337 --> 11:56.703
Name your price.

11:56.705 --> 11:58.505
You can't buy your way
out of this.

11:58.507 --> 12:02.142
You know, my wife knows
I'm missing.

12:02.144 --> 12:04.678
So do the cops.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.314
You let me go,
I won't say a word.

12:07.316 --> 12:10.884
We ain't worried
about the cops.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.220
Whoo!

12:14.222 --> 12:17.957
Let's get this show
on the road.

12:19.660 --> 12:21.361
Take off your clothes.

12:23.230 --> 12:25.798
What?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.000
Why?

12:27.002 --> 12:29.002
'Cause I said so!

12:30.004 --> 12:32.405
Get the camera ready.

12:34.742 --> 12:36.776
What are you waiting for?

12:36.778 --> 12:38.778
I said take 'em off.

12:40.013 --> 12:42.281
I'm not taking off
my clothes.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.117
Oh.

12:44.119 --> 12:47.487
You know...

12:47.489 --> 12:50.022
maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.292
Oh! Uhh! Uhh!

12:53.294 --> 12:54.527
What are you doing, man?

12:54.529 --> 12:56.896
Showing this punk
what's gonna happen

12:56.898 --> 12:59.665
if he doesn't
follow directions.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.234
Just--just do what
he says, all right?

13:15.749 --> 13:19.251
The amount of detail
needed to pull off this abduction

13:19.253 --> 13:21.120
was pretty sophisticated.

13:21.122 --> 13:23.289
Yeah. Not only did they
lure him to the lot,

13:23.291 --> 13:25.624
but they managed to dodge
most of the security cameras.

13:25.626 --> 13:28.861
Well, at least we know
one the unsubs is a football fan.

13:28.863 --> 13:33.799
Him and the 636,479
other people in this city.

13:33.801 --> 13:35.334
What?

13:35.336 --> 13:36.869
Not you, too?

13:36.871 --> 13:37.970
I googled it.

13:37.972 --> 13:39.171
Ah.

13:41.141 --> 13:44.343
Wow, they definitely did
a number on his car.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.346
And saved the real
torture for him.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.847
That's a lot of rage.

13:48.849 --> 13:50.449
If it were a body,

13:50.451 --> 13:52.451
we'd say this was
complete overkill.

13:52.453 --> 13:55.754
You think these guys
knew Jack personally?

13:55.756 --> 13:58.957
It's sure starting
to look that way.

14:00.826 --> 14:03.361
How long has Jack Westbrook
worked for your company?

14:03.364 --> 14:05.097
Almost two years.

14:05.099 --> 14:07.466
Had he received
any threats recently?

14:07.468 --> 14:09.134
Not to my knowledge.

14:09.136 --> 14:10.936
In fact,
his clients love him.

14:10.938 --> 14:13.472
Can you tell us about
his current caseload.

14:13.474 --> 14:14.906
Well, they're pretty
straightforward.

14:14.908 --> 14:17.609
DUIs, grand larceny.

14:17.611 --> 14:20.278
Nothing that would have
had this type of blowback.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.547
What about
the cases he lost?

14:22.549 --> 14:24.583
They were both minor.

14:24.585 --> 14:26.118
Family disputes.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.886
One client was
sentenced to probation,

14:27.888 --> 14:30.055
the other to anger
management classes.

14:30.057 --> 14:31.990
His wife mentioned
that he'd been working

14:31.992 --> 14:33.525
a lot of overtime lately.

14:33.527 --> 14:35.260
What was he working on?

14:35.262 --> 14:36.862
Well, he just wrapped
a case yesterday,

14:36.864 --> 14:39.464
got the kid off with
community service.

14:39.466 --> 14:42.667
Jack didn't work
overtime for that.

14:42.669 --> 14:45.470
If fact, he hadn't billed
any overtime in months.

14:45.472 --> 14:48.606
Most days, he was
off the clock by 6:00.

14:57.315 --> 15:00.117
If Westbrook wasn't at home
or in his office, where the hell was he?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.820
That's a good question.
I'm starting to think his abduction

15:01.822 --> 15:03.655
had nothing to do
with a case.

15:03.657 --> 15:05.423
What are you willing to bet
that those roses

15:05.425 --> 15:08.026
had more to do with guilt
than romance?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.929
I am made of cream.
Give me your coffee.

15:10.931 --> 15:12.664
Hey, baby girl, listen,
you're on speaker.

15:12.665 --> 15:15.165
Reid and I think Westbrook
might have been having an affair.

15:15.168 --> 15:16.567
And the plot thickens.

15:16.569 --> 15:19.270
Yeah. I need you to dig deeper
into his personal life.

15:19.272 --> 15:20.772
He's definitely
hiding something.

15:20.774 --> 15:23.641
Look at hotel invoices,
large cash withdrawals,

15:23.643 --> 15:25.376
anything that
screams mistress.

15:25.378 --> 15:28.112
Oh, if he is sharing his sugar,
I will let you know.

15:28.114 --> 15:30.448
Thanks, mama.

15:30.450 --> 15:32.116
So you think this could be
a jealous boyfriend

15:32.118 --> 15:33.618
or husband and his buddy
out for revenge?

15:33.620 --> 15:35.186
Right now we can't
rule out anything.

15:35.188 --> 15:36.788
It's probably not
the first time

15:36.790 --> 15:38.289
this guy flew into
a jealous rage.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.591
I'll put together a list
of recent domestic disputes.

15:41.661 --> 15:43.261
You're on speaker, Garcia.

15:43.263 --> 15:45.796
I have searched hither
and down for something

15:45.798 --> 15:48.499
that will connect
Mr. can't-keep-it-in-his-pants

15:48.501 --> 15:49.967
with this mystery woman.
I came up with zilch

15:49.969 --> 15:51.836
until I went back
two years ago,

15:51.838 --> 15:54.238
and I found an LLC

15:54.240 --> 15:55.640
in Jack's name.

15:55.642 --> 15:57.375
Here's where things
get super suspect.

15:57.377 --> 15:59.110
That company has been
wiring money

15:59.112 --> 16:01.212
to cover the rent
of an apartment downtown,

16:01.214 --> 16:02.446
and the name
on the lease is...

16:02.447 --> 16:03.613
Westbrook.

16:03.616 --> 16:05.883
Winner, winner, vegetarian dinner.

16:05.885 --> 16:07.718
Sounds like the perfect
place to keep a mistress.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.353
Any leads on
the mystery woman?

16:09.355 --> 16:12.089
No. There's no texts,
there's no emails, phone calls, nothing.

16:12.091 --> 16:14.325
Whoever she is, he's keeping
her really well hid.

16:24.970 --> 16:26.670
Clear.

16:26.672 --> 16:28.105
Clear here.

16:29.474 --> 16:32.209
Wow. Check this place out.

16:32.211 --> 16:33.811
Talk about a man cave.

16:33.813 --> 16:35.312
He spared no expense.

16:35.314 --> 16:38.315
How much
did all this cost?

16:38.317 --> 16:39.683
At least 10 grand.

16:39.685 --> 16:42.186
Jack has an odd sense
of romance.

16:42.188 --> 16:44.121
I expected more
from the guy.

16:44.123 --> 16:46.390
This place wasn't
just for romance.

16:46.392 --> 16:48.191
It was his escape.

16:52.330 --> 16:55.399
Aah! Aah! No!

16:55.401 --> 16:56.433
No! Stop!

16:56.435 --> 16:58.835
Stop! Aah!

16:58.837 --> 17:01.071
Ah! Oh!

17:02.908 --> 17:06.076
How does if feel
to be on the other side?

17:06.078 --> 17:08.779
I don't know
what you're talking about!

17:08.781 --> 17:12.415
What's wrong? You don't
like the attention.

17:14.286 --> 17:15.785
Why are you doing this?

17:15.787 --> 17:17.454
Come on.

17:17.455 --> 17:20.757
Smile for the camera.

17:21.592 --> 17:24.594
Now you know how Matt felt.

17:27.632 --> 17:29.599
What did you say?

17:29.601 --> 17:32.302
Stand up.

17:32.304 --> 17:35.105
Stand up!

17:55.092 --> 17:57.026
Remember us?

18:11.723 --> 18:13.356
You think
he's in shock?

18:13.458 --> 18:15.792
It doesn't matter.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.428
He'd better start
talking soon.

18:20.397 --> 18:22.232
Don't you think
you've had enough?

18:26.403 --> 18:29.305
What if he doesn't
start talking?

18:29.307 --> 18:30.373
He will.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.608
Trust me.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.943
Yeah, but what if
he doesn't?

18:33.945 --> 18:36.212
Then what's the plan?

18:37.481 --> 18:40.049
We bring in reinforcements.

18:46.590 --> 18:48.925
Well, apparently none of the neighbors
have seen Jack enter

18:48.927 --> 18:51.661
or leave the apartment
in the last 6 months.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.568
I don't get it.

18:52.592 --> 18:54.498
Why get married if
you're just gonna cheat?

18:54.699 --> 18:57.767
Well, some people think
the grass is greener on the other side.

18:57.769 --> 18:58.901
Yeah? What about you?

18:58.903 --> 19:01.437
Oh, my grass is plenty green.

19:07.444 --> 19:09.045
Morgan.

19:15.152 --> 19:18.220
We need to deliver
the profile.

19:24.929 --> 19:27.663
Did you--
did you find him?

19:27.665 --> 19:29.498
Have a seat.

19:31.201 --> 19:34.036
Oh, God.

19:38.642 --> 19:40.776
Is he ok?

19:40.778 --> 19:43.979
In order to help
find your husband,

19:43.981 --> 19:46.215
I need to share
some difficult truths.

19:46.217 --> 19:50.519
Will you please tell me
what's going on.

19:50.521 --> 19:52.321
We have reason to believe

19:52.323 --> 19:54.690
your husband's a pedophile.

19:55.658 --> 19:58.260
What are you talk--
what are you talking about?

19:58.262 --> 20:00.963
We found evidence
that would allow us to charge Jack...

20:00.965 --> 20:02.297
This has to be
some sort of mistake.

20:02.299 --> 20:04.066
With multiple counts
of both production...

20:04.068 --> 20:05.701
You're wrong! No!
And possession of pornography.

20:05.703 --> 20:08.003
No!

20:08.005 --> 20:09.338
Oh, my God.

20:09.340 --> 20:11.173
Oh, my God!

20:11.175 --> 20:14.142
Oh, my God.

20:16.912 --> 20:18.412
Which is why we believe
Jack Westbrook

20:18.415 --> 20:19.815
used his position
of authority

20:19.817 --> 20:21.984
to exploit the trust
of his young victims.

20:21.985 --> 20:24.318
As an attorney, Westbrook
had unfettered access

20:24.321 --> 20:26.221
to vulnerable victims
who were easy to groom.

20:26.223 --> 20:29.291
He targeted those who would
be afraid to come forward,

20:29.293 --> 20:32.894
because they'd been ostracized
from society due to their crimes.

20:32.896 --> 20:34.963
Much like Jerry Sandusky,
who hid behind

20:34.965 --> 20:38.166
his nonprofit foundation
for underprivileged and at-risk youth

20:38.168 --> 20:41.436
in order to abuse young boys
over several decades.

20:41.438 --> 20:43.038
We found hundreds
of photographs

20:43.039 --> 20:44.938
of Westbrook's victims
in his apartment.

20:44.941 --> 20:46.708
Based on the dates
on the photos,

20:46.710 --> 20:48.843
our unsubs are now
in their 20s.

20:48.845 --> 20:50.679
We think his past
came back to haunt him.

20:50.681 --> 20:52.781
The unsubs are either
former victims

20:52.783 --> 20:55.016
or family members
seeking revenge.

20:55.018 --> 20:56.651
And when they were younger,
each of the victims

20:56.652 --> 20:58.986
had run-ins with the law, which is how
they came in contact with Westbrook.

20:58.989 --> 21:00.722
They've been carrying
the burden of the victimization

21:00.724 --> 21:03.024
around with them for years,
and it's affected their ability

21:03.026 --> 21:06.561
to find and maintain employment as well
as serious relationships.

21:06.563 --> 21:07.962
This mutual trauma
would cause them

21:07.964 --> 21:09.297
to isolate themselves
from others,

21:09.299 --> 21:11.332
yet draw them close
to one another.

21:11.334 --> 21:13.234
Their shared revenge
motive makes them

21:13.236 --> 21:15.370
extremely dangerous
and volatile.

21:15.372 --> 21:16.771
This is a deeply
personal mission,

21:16.773 --> 21:19.540
and it's been fueled by years of shame,
hatred, and anger

21:19.542 --> 21:22.844
which has finally
exploded to the surface.

21:22.846 --> 21:25.146
Keep I mind the unsubs
are also victims.

21:25.148 --> 21:27.148
Make it known that
we have every intention

21:27.149 --> 21:29.716
of bringing Westbrook
to justice for his crimes.

21:29.718 --> 21:32.452
Why go after Westbrook now,
after all these years?

21:32.455 --> 21:36.123
It's likely something pushed one
if not both of the unsubs over the edge.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.826
It could have been
an anniversary or a recent death.

21:38.828 --> 21:40.161
And understanding
that trigger

21:40.163 --> 21:41.629
will be key
to preventing these two

21:41.631 --> 21:44.365
from crossing the line
between kidnapping and killing.

21:44.367 --> 21:46.567
Thank you.

21:50.605 --> 21:52.173
Dude, you should have
seen your face.

21:52.175 --> 21:54.308
It wasn't funny, Chad.
You guys could have just called.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.377
Why, so you could send our call
straight to voicemail again?

21:56.379 --> 21:57.712
And where were you
yesterday, huh?

21:57.714 --> 21:59.680
Yeah, bull.
I had to work.

21:59.682 --> 22:03.050
Will one of you tell me
why the hell I'm here.

22:03.052 --> 22:05.720
Go see for yourself.

22:32.514 --> 22:34.548
You ok?

22:35.984 --> 22:38.819
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just get this guy.

22:41.389 --> 22:42.756
How did Linda
take it?

22:42.758 --> 22:44.758
Well, at first
she defended him,

22:44.760 --> 22:46.827
insisted he would have
never jeopardized his career.

22:46.829 --> 22:48.662
But by the end,
she was asking me

22:48.664 --> 22:50.397
if I knew any good
divorce lawyers.

22:50.399 --> 22:52.366
What about out here?
Anything?

22:52.368 --> 22:53.834
Yeah. We've been able
to put together

22:53.836 --> 22:56.303
somewhat of a timeline,
dating back to early 2000.

22:56.305 --> 22:59.206
This guy literally has hundreds of cases
involving young boys.

22:59.208 --> 23:02.609
The list of victims and potential unsubs
just keep getting longer.

23:02.611 --> 23:04.911
Moving around
wasn't for safety.

23:04.913 --> 23:07.581
It was because he wanted
to avoid getting caught.

23:07.582 --> 23:10.015
Westbrook didn't touch
these kids.

23:10.018 --> 23:11.318
What are you
talking about?

23:11.320 --> 23:12.486
Linda was right.

23:12.488 --> 23:13.987
He wouldn't have
jeopardized his career.

23:13.989 --> 23:15.122
He's smart.

23:15.124 --> 23:16.690
These boys are too big
of a risk.

23:16.692 --> 23:18.124
Think about it.

23:18.126 --> 23:19.559
Sandusky didn't molest
his players.

23:19.561 --> 23:21.328
He kept it separate.

23:21.330 --> 23:24.297
We need to be looking for a place that's
completely unconnected,

23:24.298 --> 23:26.699
that wouldn't have
affected Westbrook's career.

23:26.702 --> 23:28.535
How do you know?

23:31.238 --> 23:34.174
Just trust me, I know.

23:39.046 --> 23:42.182
You know I hate this guy
just as much as you do,

23:42.184 --> 23:43.450
but this is insane.

23:43.452 --> 23:45.051
You have to let him go.

23:45.053 --> 23:46.486
Let's just get
his confession,

23:46.488 --> 23:47.821
then go straight
to the cops.

23:47.823 --> 23:50.090
And say what, you kidnapped a man
and held him prisoner?

23:50.092 --> 23:51.958
We have to at least try.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.393
I mean, we owe it to Matt.

23:53.395 --> 23:55.595
You think any of this
will make a difference?

23:55.597 --> 23:57.096
It won't.

23:57.098 --> 23:58.431
I'm out of here.

23:58.433 --> 23:59.766
Hey. Hey,

23:59.768 --> 24:01.067
you're not leaving.

24:01.069 --> 24:02.335
How much
have you had to drink?

24:02.337 --> 24:04.170
This is payback,

24:04.172 --> 24:07.507
for what that perv did.

24:07.509 --> 24:09.575
He ruined our lives.

24:10.544 --> 24:12.378
You're right!

24:12.380 --> 24:15.081
What I did, it was wrong.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.283
But that was in the past.

24:17.285 --> 24:19.152
I swear to you,
I've changed.

24:19.154 --> 24:20.787
Say it again to the camera.

24:20.789 --> 24:22.989
Look, I'm married.

24:22.991 --> 24:26.092
I even have
a kid on the way.

24:26.094 --> 24:28.961
Please, just let me
get back to my family.

24:28.963 --> 24:32.598
What if he's right?
What if he has changed?

24:32.600 --> 24:35.334
I can't believe
you're falling for these lies.

24:35.336 --> 24:38.904
People like him
don't change.

24:39.740 --> 24:42.008
Hey, Chad, take it easy.

24:42.010 --> 24:44.176
The only way you're
getting out of here is in a body bag!

24:44.178 --> 24:45.778
What are you doing?

24:45.780 --> 24:49.015
Put the gun down, Chad,
all right?

24:49.017 --> 24:51.650
Stop! What are you doing?!

24:53.286 --> 24:55.254
What are you doing, Chad?

24:55.256 --> 24:57.757
No!
Give me the gun!

24:57.759 --> 24:59.125
Uhh!

24:59.127 --> 25:01.894
No!
Aah!

25:08.891 --> 25:10.091
The more we learn
about Westbrook,

25:10.094 --> 25:11.460
the less I want
to save him.

25:11.462 --> 25:13.996
This isn't about him,
it's about saving his victims.

25:13.998 --> 25:16.532
According to this,
back in 2005,

25:16.533 --> 25:19.100
Westbrook worked closely
with a volunteer-run facility

25:19.103 --> 25:22.338
known as the Sudworth Place.
It's a halfway house for troubled kids.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.273
Yeah, he's still pretty active with
the organization.

25:24.275 --> 25:26.475
He made a $5,000
donation last year.

25:26.477 --> 25:28.010
Looks like he chaired
numerous events

25:28.012 --> 25:29.845
and even hosted
overnight field trips.

25:29.847 --> 25:32.982
That would give him the isolation
he needed to manipulate these boys.

25:32.984 --> 25:34.383
Holy moley.

25:34.385 --> 25:37.219
Last week, a former resident
of the Sudworth Place,

25:37.221 --> 25:39.622
Matthew Jones,
he committed suicide.

25:39.624 --> 25:41.357
How?

25:41.359 --> 25:43.192
Uh...Drug overdose.

25:43.513 --> 25:45.213
According to his last
social media post,

25:45.215 --> 25:48.649
he, quote, "couldn't deal
with the injustice of this world."

25:48.651 --> 25:49.884
When was
the funeral, Garcia?

25:49.886 --> 25:51.485
Yesterday morning.

25:51.487 --> 25:53.421
It's no coincidence
that later that night

25:53.422 --> 25:54.821
Jack Westbrook went missing.

25:54.824 --> 25:57.558
Matthew's death must have been
the unsub's trigger.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.859
Yeah, this is about
retribution.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.028
Garcia, see who else
spent time at Sudworth Place

26:01.030 --> 26:02.530
around the time
Matthew was there.

26:02.532 --> 26:03.898
Our unsubs will be
on that list.

26:03.900 --> 26:07.601
Come on, Chad, get up, man.
This isn't funny.

26:07.603 --> 26:08.936
He's dead.

26:08.938 --> 26:10.137
You killed him.

26:10.139 --> 26:11.705
Shut the hell up!

26:11.707 --> 26:13.507
Chad, get up!

26:13.509 --> 26:14.742
What'd you do?

26:14.744 --> 26:16.877
You saw what happened.
It was an accident.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.345
I was trying to stop him.

26:18.347 --> 26:19.346
Nobody was supposed to die.

26:19.348 --> 26:20.381
Chad was gonna kill him.

26:20.383 --> 26:22.383
Which one of you
is gonna be next?

26:22.385 --> 26:24.151
Shut up!

26:24.153 --> 26:25.653
I need to think.

26:25.655 --> 26:28.288
How far are you
gonna take this?

26:28.290 --> 26:30.958
Where are you going?
We all need to get out of here.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.726
I'm not going anywhere
until I get what I came here for,

26:32.728 --> 26:34.161
and that's his confession
on camera.

26:34.163 --> 26:35.163
Andrew, come on!

26:35.164 --> 26:36.730
Look where revenge
has gotten you.

26:36.732 --> 26:39.566
Chad is dead.

26:39.568 --> 26:41.935
Keep and eye on him.

26:41.937 --> 26:43.770
Wait, where are you going?

26:43.772 --> 26:45.205
If he doesn't start talking,

26:45.207 --> 26:49.243
then we're gonna burn
this whole place down with him in it.

26:55.049 --> 26:57.250
I've got more 4-1-1
on Matthew Jones.

26:57.252 --> 27:00.354
He was in and out of the
Sudworth Place from 2002 to 2004.

27:00.356 --> 27:02.089
He overlapped
with 22 other boys.

27:02.091 --> 27:03.857
Look for guys with
spotty work histories,

27:03.859 --> 27:06.126
mostly working odd
or solitary jobs.

27:06.128 --> 27:07.627
Not enough.
Give me more.

27:07.629 --> 27:09.496
They most likely
would have stayed in the area.

27:09.498 --> 27:10.530
Ok. We're getting
somewhere,

27:10.532 --> 27:12.099
sort of somewhere.
I got 6 names.

27:12.101 --> 27:14.167
Garcia, these guys
went through a traumatic experience.

27:14.169 --> 27:15.936
They would have
stayed in contact with each other.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.004
Ok...

27:18.006 --> 27:20.740
Bingo. Chad Griffith,
Andrew Ford, Brian Stiller.

27:20.742 --> 27:24.244
According to social media,
they have kept in contact.

27:24.246 --> 27:29.015
Only Andrew and Chad
posted about Matthew's death.

27:29.017 --> 27:31.585
Uh, Andrew recently wrote
about, quote,

27:31.587 --> 27:33.720
"bringing the monsters
to justice."

27:33.722 --> 27:36.823
Chad, not so much, quote,
"I could kill him with my bare hands."

27:36.825 --> 27:38.358
Two different
motivations.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.794
One wants revenge,
the other one justice.

27:40.796 --> 27:42.195
I think we have
our two unsubs.

27:42.197 --> 27:44.097
What about the third guy
Brian Stiller?

27:44.099 --> 27:46.132
He works as a janitor

27:46.134 --> 27:47.767
at the Harold Street Motel.

27:47.769 --> 27:49.869
He has lived and worked there
for the last two years.

27:49.871 --> 27:51.538
You think he has
anything to do with this?

27:51.540 --> 27:53.139
We should talk to him.

27:54.675 --> 27:57.377
Say your name
for the camera.

28:00.581 --> 28:03.916
Come on. This is the only way
you're gonna get out of here alive.

28:05.919 --> 28:09.889
Do you have a death wish?

28:09.891 --> 28:11.457
Andrew's gonna be back soon.

28:11.459 --> 28:13.793
If you don't talk,
he's gonna burn this place down

28:13.795 --> 28:15.628
with you in it.

28:18.565 --> 28:21.267
None of this
was my idea.

28:21.269 --> 28:22.935
I know that.

28:22.937 --> 28:25.171
They dragged you into it.

28:25.173 --> 28:29.008
And now you could be
facing manslaughter.

28:29.010 --> 28:30.476
You don't understand.
Chad was gonna--

28:30.478 --> 28:32.511
Brian, Brian, Brian.

28:33.747 --> 28:36.549
You're a good kid,
I know that.

28:41.388 --> 28:44.523
Ohh...I always knew
you were different.

28:48.495 --> 28:51.363
I saw what no one else
could see.

28:51.365 --> 28:54.667
Not even your parents.

28:54.669 --> 28:57.069
What are you talking about?

28:57.071 --> 28:59.238
You weren't like the others.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.842
Even back then.

29:02.844 --> 29:04.043
Oh, come on.

29:04.045 --> 29:06.912
You knew you were special.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.717
To be honest,

29:11.719 --> 29:15.087
you were my favorite.

29:16.790 --> 29:19.124
The pizza
and the video games.

29:19.126 --> 29:20.426
I don't want
to hear this.

29:20.428 --> 29:22.060
Remember I took you
to see "Harry Potter"?

29:22.062 --> 29:23.262
You loved those books.

29:23.264 --> 29:24.463
I said I don't want
to hear this.

29:24.465 --> 29:25.964
You'd stay up all night
reading--

29:25.966 --> 29:28.233
Stop! Just stop!

29:36.010 --> 29:39.211
Look...

29:39.213 --> 29:41.480
There's still time
to get out of this.

29:41.482 --> 29:44.583
There's already
one dead body down here.

29:44.585 --> 29:48.019
If I die, that makes two.

29:48.021 --> 29:51.022
The cops will make
the connection.

29:53.593 --> 29:56.862
And guess who's taking
the fall for it.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.967
It won't be Andrew.

30:01.969 --> 30:03.869
He'll pin this
whole thing on you.

30:03.871 --> 30:07.706
I mean, after all,
you're the one who killed Chad.

30:10.343 --> 30:12.911
Brian, look at me.

30:12.913 --> 30:14.913
Hey, Brian.

30:15.748 --> 30:18.450
Brian, look at me!

30:21.921 --> 30:23.988
You have to end this.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.724
Get me out of here...

30:26.726 --> 30:28.893
and you and I can
both go to the cops

30:28.895 --> 30:31.663
and we can explain
this whole thing to them.

30:31.665 --> 30:33.198
We'll do it together.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.810
Brian Stiller, FBI!

30:54.119 --> 30:55.253
Clear!

30:55.255 --> 30:57.488
Clear.

30:57.490 --> 31:00.992
Aaron, I think you might want to
take a look at this.

31:21.714 --> 31:22.714
You all right?

31:22.715 --> 31:24.348
Come on.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.752
You did the right thing.

31:27.754 --> 31:30.621
What's gonna happen
to Andrew?

31:30.623 --> 31:33.424
I think you know
what needs to be done.

31:34.726 --> 31:39.029
You take care of him,
I'll go deal with the cops.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.331
But you said
we'd go together.

31:40.333 --> 31:44.401
Just--just let me
deal with them.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.103
All right?

31:46.105 --> 31:48.739
Trust me.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.374
You go home

31:50.376 --> 31:53.344
and you get rid
of those keepsakes.

31:53.346 --> 31:56.213
And make sure
there are no loose ends.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.482
What's that
supposed to mean?

32:00.785 --> 32:04.088
Hey, come on.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.490
You thought
I didn't know?

32:06.492 --> 32:10.160
I've always known
you and I were alike.

32:10.162 --> 32:14.031
Even when you were
a little boy.

32:16.868 --> 32:20.204
I saw that sparkle
in your eye.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.673
It's ok. Shh.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.208
It's ok, hey?

32:25.210 --> 32:27.778
Your secret
is safe with me.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.080
Hey, I found this--

32:33.452 --> 32:34.651
What happened?!

32:36.888 --> 32:39.389
He gave me no choice.

32:52.317 --> 32:54.585
I checked the main
office. Brian wasn't there.

32:54.587 --> 32:56.754
According to the schedule,
he's supposed to be on duty.

32:56.756 --> 32:59.757
It looks like Brian
picked up where Jack left off.

32:59.759 --> 33:01.092
According
to the manager,

33:01.094 --> 33:02.760
he left in the middle
of his shift.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.228
She came
to look for him.

33:04.230 --> 33:05.830
Wouldn't want Brian
to miss out on the fun.

33:05.832 --> 33:07.998
The question is, are they aware of
what Brian's been hiding?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.733
No doubt that would have ruined
the friendship.

33:09.735 --> 33:12.203
We can use that.

33:14.806 --> 33:16.307
Brian...

33:21.313 --> 33:23.881
Hand me the gun.

33:23.883 --> 33:25.349
Come on, man.

33:27.219 --> 33:28.953
Come on.

33:28.955 --> 33:31.055
You should have stuck
to the plan.

33:31.057 --> 33:32.356
Why'd you get him out?

33:32.358 --> 33:33.824
He swore he'd admit
to what he did if I pulled him up.

33:33.826 --> 33:35.359
Of course he did,
and you fell for it!

33:35.361 --> 33:37.328
I tried, all right?!

33:37.330 --> 33:39.196
Come on.

33:40.699 --> 33:42.900
Let's just burn this place down
like you said

33:42.902 --> 33:46.103
and pretend
this never happened.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.575
Ok. Thanks, Hotch.

33:51.577 --> 33:53.877
They found several
photos of underage boys.

33:53.879 --> 33:56.780
He'd been keeping
their underwear as souvenirs.

33:58.783 --> 34:00.951
What Brian's done is rare.

34:00.953 --> 34:02.853
Statistically, very few victims
of molestation

34:02.855 --> 34:04.721
become predators themselves.

34:04.723 --> 34:07.591
We searched Andrew and Chad's
apartment. Came up empty.

34:07.593 --> 34:09.592
Spoke to a neighbor, said she
hadn't seen them in a few days.

34:09.594 --> 34:11.895
Well, make sure you keep a couple
of your guys back to patrol the area

34:11.897 --> 34:13.230
just in case they surface.

34:13.232 --> 34:14.998
I'll get on it.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.067
Hey, sweetness,
tell me something good.

34:17.069 --> 34:19.369
I did some snooping into Chad
and his bank account.

34:19.371 --> 34:20.770
He's been regularly
depositing checks

34:20.772 --> 34:22.371
from a VBH Construction.

34:22.373 --> 34:24.641
They have a site that got shut down
due to permit issues.

34:24.643 --> 34:25.909
Guess where it's located.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.577
Right in the middle
of the comfort zone.

34:27.579 --> 34:29.012
Must be where
they're holding Jack.

34:29.014 --> 34:31.047
Here's the address.
Thanks, mama.

34:33.452 --> 34:37.219
All right, ready?

34:37.222 --> 34:39.155
Uhh!

34:52.303 --> 34:54.337
That's the last of it.

35:32.676 --> 35:34.110
FBI, don't move!

35:34.112 --> 35:35.511
Don't come any closer!
I mean it!

35:35.513 --> 35:36.779
Put the weapon down.

35:36.781 --> 35:37.880
What the hell
are you doing?

35:37.882 --> 35:39.215
Where are Jack and Chad?

35:39.217 --> 35:40.182
They're dead.

35:40.184 --> 35:42.385
N-nobody was
supposed to die.

35:42.387 --> 35:44.320
Andrew, put the gun down.

35:44.322 --> 35:46.255
Can't do that.
Listen to her, Drew.

35:46.257 --> 35:47.723
Shut up, Brian,
I got this.

35:47.725 --> 35:49.625
Let us help you.
Help us?

35:49.627 --> 35:51.260
Where were you
when we needed you?

35:51.262 --> 35:53.562
You have no idea what
that man did to us.

35:53.564 --> 35:55.064
We were just kids!

35:55.066 --> 35:56.632
Hey, I said back up!
Yes, I do.

35:56.634 --> 35:59.335
Just listen to me.
Just listen.

36:02.272 --> 36:04.039
I'm putting this away.

36:07.377 --> 36:09.144
Kid, you don't want
to do this.

36:09.146 --> 36:10.613
Just give me the gun.

36:10.615 --> 36:12.881
And you have my word
that I'll get you a confession.

36:12.883 --> 36:14.683
Who are you talking about?

36:14.685 --> 36:16.518
Westbrook is dead.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.320
You just gotta trust me
on this, man.

36:18.322 --> 36:19.755
Why would I trust you?

36:19.757 --> 36:22.758
Because the same thing
happened to me when I was a kid.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.294
What happened to you
happened to me.

36:25.296 --> 36:27.196
I'm not lying.

36:27.198 --> 36:28.530
Think about this.

36:28.532 --> 36:30.365
This is the rest
of your life, man.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.768
You don't want to go out
like this.

36:32.770 --> 36:36.138
Come on, look around.
Look around.

36:40.143 --> 36:43.078
A confession's not gonna mean
a damn thing if you're dead.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.882
If you put that gun down,
I can help you.

36:54.791 --> 36:57.059
Thank god you're here.
Andrew killed Jack and Chad.

36:57.061 --> 36:58.560
What?
Don't worry?

36:58.562 --> 37:00.062
We know it wasn't
your idea.

37:00.064 --> 37:01.229
But we also know

37:01.231 --> 37:02.531
that you like to keep
souvenirs.

37:02.533 --> 37:03.865
Hey, what are you
talking about?

37:03.867 --> 37:05.167
You're under arrest
for possession

37:05.169 --> 37:07.969
and distribution
of child pornography. Let's go.

37:07.971 --> 37:10.972
Brian Stiller, you have the right
to remain silent.

37:10.974 --> 37:13.208
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

37:13.210 --> 37:14.276
in a court of law...

37:15.812 --> 37:17.312
I promised you
a confession.

37:17.314 --> 37:21.416
I didn't say it would be the one
you wanted to hear.

37:24.687 --> 37:26.187
"Our moral
responsibility

37:26.189 --> 37:28.156
"is not to stop
the future,

37:28.158 --> 37:29.858
"but to shape it.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.827
"To channel our destiny
in humane directions

37:32.829 --> 37:35.430
and to ease the trauma
of transition."

37:35.432 --> 37:37.665
Alvin Toffler.

37:46.041 --> 37:47.809
We've only been gone
an hour

37:47.811 --> 37:51.112
and two more of Westbrook's
victims have come forward.

37:55.217 --> 37:57.585
You know what happened
to me, don't you?

37:59.388 --> 38:00.922
Who told you?

38:00.924 --> 38:02.357
You did.

38:02.359 --> 38:04.258
The way you handled
this case,

38:04.260 --> 38:06.928
body language, all of it.

38:08.597 --> 38:13.468
Look, you can tell me as little
or as much as you want to.

38:13.470 --> 38:15.870
But whatever happened...

38:17.005 --> 38:19.407
I'm sorry.

38:20.976 --> 38:23.077
It was a long time ago,
Callahan.

38:23.079 --> 38:24.145
I get it.

38:24.147 --> 38:28.015
How do you compartmentalize
cases like these?

38:30.520 --> 38:33.087
Believe it or not,
these are the good ones,

38:33.089 --> 38:34.789
knowing that these guys
are locked up

38:34.791 --> 38:38.492
and that they can't hurt
any more innocent children.

38:38.494 --> 38:40.895
Even though I know this stuff,
I still worry about Meg.

38:40.897 --> 38:43.030
She's got you
to look out for her.

38:43.032 --> 38:44.198
She'll be fine.

38:46.602 --> 38:47.568
Speak of the devil.

38:48.571 --> 38:51.539
Hey, sweet girl.
How was your day?

38:51.541 --> 38:54.241
It was great until Mrs. Peterson
thought it'd be genius

38:54.243 --> 38:56.610
to give us a pop quiz
fourth period.

38:56.612 --> 38:57.711
So annoying.

38:57.713 --> 38:59.480
Well, life is not finals.

38:59.482 --> 39:01.982
I know. I know.
It's daily pop quizzes.

39:01.984 --> 39:03.250
That's my girl.

39:03.252 --> 39:04.718
Where's Chris?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.420
He's still at work.

39:06.422 --> 39:09.089
Ok. Look, make sure
you're home on time.

39:09.091 --> 39:10.524
Otherwise a search party's
coming for you.

39:10.526 --> 39:11.992
And make sure you text me
when you land

39:11.994 --> 39:14.261
or I'll send one for you.

39:15.597 --> 39:17.331
I love you.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.366
Love you, too.
See you in the morning.

39:19.368 --> 39:21.335
Yeah.

39:21.337 --> 39:24.171
I still don't get
the point of homework.

39:24.173 --> 39:26.073
Right. After 6 hours
of school,

39:26.075 --> 39:27.074
the last thing
I want to do

39:27.076 --> 39:28.942
is come home
and continue the torture.

39:28.944 --> 39:32.012
Seriously, I mean, how often
is America's Next Top Model

39:32.014 --> 39:33.313
going to use geometry?

39:34.850 --> 39:37.217
OMG, he
messaged us back.

39:37.219 --> 39:39.686
He is so hot.

39:39.688 --> 39:42.889
Could you imagine
if he was your boyfriend?

39:45.193 --> 39:48.128
He's asking for a picture.

39:48.130 --> 39:49.529
Well, how's my hair look?

39:49.531 --> 39:52.332
Wait, you're not actually
sending him one, are you?

39:52.334 --> 39:54.835
Well, he's a senior.
No big deal.

39:54.837 --> 39:57.737
Ok,
if you're so worried,

39:57.739 --> 39:59.306
then take it with me.
