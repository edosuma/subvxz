[Stammering] Did you know
it's 277 Miles long,

00:12.610 --> 00:16.119
18 Miles wide,
and over a mile deep?

00:16.120 --> 00:19.319
I mean, in places.
It's not a mile deep everywhere.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.489
Although that looks like
a mile.

00:21.490 --> 00:24.999
Did you know
recent evident suggests

00:25.000 --> 00:27.460
the Colorado river formed
the canyon over...

00:27.470 --> 00:29.899
Maybe they have earplugs
in the gift shop.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.200
Ooh! Mini license plates!

00:33.210 --> 00:36.409
Aha! Daniel, Darvin,
Doug, Eduardo...

00:36.410 --> 00:38.379
What the--no daffy?

00:38.380 --> 00:42.510
You have 5 Darvins
and no daffy? Darvin?

00:42.520 --> 00:45.780
"1,001 grand canyon jokes."

00:45.790 --> 00:48.120
That's about 1,000 more
than I thought there were.

00:48.121 --> 00:51.659
I mean, what, did someone just
match Darren and Marvin together

00:51.660 --> 00:53.759
and think that
that's a clever name?

00:53.760 --> 00:56.799
Well, it's not!
It's a stupid name.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.830
Darvin is
the world's stupidest name.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.769
Great name.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.979
And the soda.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.880
I left my wallet at home.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.349
[Stammering] Was originally
inhabited by native Americans,

01:15.350 --> 01:17.550
some of whom may have considered
the grand canyon

01:17.560 --> 01:19.219
to be a holy site.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.720
So, what do you think?

01:20.730 --> 01:22.690
[Gargles]

01:22.700 --> 01:26.760
I've seen better.

01:27.530 --> 01:29.230
Let's go see a movie.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.940
Sir, you threw a can of soda
into the grand canyon.

01:33.941 --> 01:35.740
That's littering
on federal property.

01:35.741 --> 01:37.010
And who are you?

01:37.011 --> 01:39.079
I'm a park ranger.
Who are you?

01:39.080 --> 01:41.749
Oh. Uh, Darvin.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.419
Andrew...Son.

01:44.420 --> 01:45.880
You're coming with me.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.719
Wait!
Let's be reasonable.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.420
Buddy, if you don't put
some pants on,

01:49.421 --> 01:51.360
you're going to be coming
with me, too.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.059
I think I saw some
at the gift shop.

01:54.060 --> 01:56.259
Let me go, and I'll pay you
whatever you want!

01:56.260 --> 02:00.160
Ahh, I forgot my wallet.
Bugs! Pay him whatever he wants!

02:00.170 --> 02:02.799
Aren't you going
to say something?

02:02.800 --> 02:06.769
"Why is the grand canyon
called the grand canyon?"

02:06.770 --> 02:09.940
"Cause he thought gargantuan
canyon made him sound fat."

02:11.740 --> 02:18.180
Well? If you don't like
that one, I got 1,000 more.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.380
It's clear
that you are the litterer.

02:50.381 --> 02:53.210
The fine is $50.
This court is now adjourned.

02:53.220 --> 02:56.880
Your honor,
this is a case built on lies,

02:56.890 --> 02:58.389
stacked on a house of cards

02:58.390 --> 03:01.290
standing on a Mountain
of fabricated falsehoods.

03:02.220 --> 03:04.229
I move for immediate dismissal.

03:04.230 --> 03:05.859
You can't do that.

03:05.860 --> 03:10.470
Well, then I'd like to call
my first witness.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.939
Would you please state your name
for the court?

Porky Pig.

03:15.710 --> 03:18.909
What's the matter?
Are you nervous?

03:18.910 --> 03:20.940
I'm not nervous.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.279
You sure sound nervous.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.510
This is what I always sound--

03:25.520 --> 03:28.049
- maybe you're nervous
because you're lying.

03:28.050 --> 03:29.389
But I'm not--

03:29.390 --> 03:32.159
- maybe you're lying because
you don't want us to know

03:32.160 --> 03:33.820
your true identity.

03:33.830 --> 03:36.390
My--

03:36.400 --> 03:39.460
- and the reason you don't want
us to know your true identity

03:39.470 --> 03:43.399
is because you, sir,
are the litterer!

[Fan squeaks]

03:46.670 --> 03:48.409

Please state your name
for the court.

04:08.761 --> 04:10.059
Bugs Bunny.

04:10.060 --> 04:13.759
Mr. Bunny, where were you on
the night of November 10th?

04:13.760 --> 04:15.560
Uh, I'm not sure,

04:15.570 --> 04:18.769
but didn't this happen
in the daytime on June first?

04:18.769 --> 04:20.430
Aha!
And how would you know that

04:20.440 --> 04:22.100
if you were not guilty
of this heinous crime?

04:22.101 --> 04:24.639
Ladies and gentlemen,
here is your litterer.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.970
Daffy, just pay the fine.

04:26.980 --> 04:31.149
- Hostile witness!
- Oh, you call this hostile?

04:31.150 --> 04:32.910
This is not hostile.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.280
If you want hostile,
I'll give you hostile.

04:36.290 --> 04:38.249
- Objection!
- Overruled!

04:38.250 --> 04:40.050
- That's what I say!
- What?

04:40.060 --> 04:41.659
- Overruled.
- Sustained.

04:41.660 --> 04:44.559
Keep this up, and I'll hold you
both in contempt of court.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.560
I apologize for my friend,
your highness. Now, if I may.

04:49.570 --> 04:53.930
What do we know?
The piece of litter in question?

04:53.940 --> 04:55.869
A can of soda.

04:55.870 --> 05:00.070
So, it would fit that the
litterer must like soda.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.079
It may surprise
the court to learn

05:02.080 --> 05:06.949
that I, Daffy Duck,
despise soda.

05:06.950 --> 05:09.749
[Gasps]

05:09.750 --> 05:12.419
Is anyone even listening here?

05:12.420 --> 05:16.219
The point is, I can't
possibly be the litterer,

05:16.220 --> 05:18.559
because I don't like soda.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.300
And if the soda gets spit,
you must acquit.

You are both held in contempt

in jail immediately.

being too good-looking.

to be swimming in this.

a ton of new people,

a big, fat traffic cone.

making rocks into smaller rocks?

that you're a hardened criminal,
