01:25.903 --> 01:30.240
My city was named Chromium.

01:30.273 --> 01:32.309
It had a halo.

01:38.415 --> 01:40.350
But it was full of devils.

01:46.858 --> 01:48.726
I could soar through the cosmos,

01:48.760 --> 01:50.327
gathering light from my city,

01:50.360 --> 01:54.666
but there was always someone
who wanted to destroy me

01:54.699 --> 01:58.368
just because I could fly.

01:58.402 --> 02:01.739
My archenemy, Cleo Vantrik.

02:05.409 --> 02:08.846
On that day, she was going
to destroy the city,

02:08.880 --> 02:12.382
kill everyone,
annihilate all flesh.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.652
She called it the Void Machine.

02:22.593 --> 02:24.294
I stopped her.

02:24.327 --> 02:27.431
But it was
the last thing I ever did.

02:30.802 --> 02:34.672
I punched through the molecules
to create a vortex.

02:53.024 --> 02:57.227
I detonated it in the silence
between space and time.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.340
And I grabbed onto
any reality that I could.

03:15.046 --> 03:17.247
This one.

03:28.893 --> 03:32.029
I smashed my way to this
bullshit reality

03:32.063 --> 03:33.965
to save Chromium.

03:33.998 --> 03:37.902
You saved the fucking world.

03:37.935 --> 03:40.605
I did.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.439
That one, anyway.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.408
You still got them superpowers?

03:45.442 --> 03:47.377
The power to drink
a fifth of whiskey

03:47.410 --> 03:48.512
and not pay it.

03:48.545 --> 03:51.381
Hey, he paid for my drink.

03:51.414 --> 03:53.017
He gets the story.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.352
I sure do.

03:55.385 --> 03:56.921
How about another one?

04:05.730 --> 04:06.731
To Chromium.

04:06.764 --> 04:08.431
To Chromium.

04:27.384 --> 04:31.055
15 over here, man.
Best on the block.

04:33.858 --> 04:34.926
Here.

04:34.959 --> 04:36.627
Hey, good looking, man.

04:36.661 --> 04:39.096
I'll see you soon.
I'll be here.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.960
Yo. Bro, show me the watches.
Show me the watches, bro.

05:08.993 --> 05:10.761
Come on, dawg. Back up, bro.

05:10.795 --> 05:12.462
- I'm not fucking around.
- Street like a thug.

05:12.495 --> 05:15.132
Bro, don't call me a thug,
first of all. Back up, bro.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.934
It's gonna go... It's gonna go
crazy on Trendible, son.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.468
- Come on, bro.
- Yo, what you selling?

05:18.501 --> 05:21.572
- Get out my...
- What you selling?

05:21.606 --> 05:23.875
Dude, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

05:23.908 --> 05:27.879
- Look, sorry.
- You broke my phone.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.881
Ain't nobody buying your shit
anyways, man.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.782
Buying my shit?
You... You tripping.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.516
What are you talking about?

06:16.027 --> 06:17.828
Hey, Melissa.

06:17.862 --> 06:20.197
It's Hamster.

06:20.231 --> 06:22.199
I want to do stories
for you guys.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.669
Look, I have a lot of creatives.
Everyone's a creator, love.

06:24.702 --> 06:27.171
You don't have anyone here
who's from my world.

06:27.204 --> 06:31.008
Where are you from?

06:31.042 --> 06:32.910
I'm from crazy town.

06:32.944 --> 06:35.046
I'm from the streets.

06:35.079 --> 06:36.814
I can show you Hamster's world.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.818
- Hamster's world?
- Yeah.

06:40.851 --> 06:42.820
Alright. Alright, show me.

06:42.853 --> 06:45.790
Easy. Check this dude out.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.024
Who's that?

06:47.058 --> 06:49.260
He's a local drug dealer.

06:49.293 --> 06:53.097
I report on the grit,
the human story from the inside.

06:53.130 --> 06:55.967
This majestic bitch
is 12 years old,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.102
and she's already playing
the pan flute.

06:58.135 --> 07:00.972
- What else you got?
- Okay, what else you want?

07:01.005 --> 07:02.940
I'm Hamster, Melissa.
I can dig it up.

07:02.974 --> 07:04.709
I can make it happen.

07:04.742 --> 07:07.678
I mean, come on,
look around you.

07:07.712 --> 07:08.913
Look at the damn cat with the...

07:08.946 --> 07:10.781
What is that? Laser cats?

07:10.815 --> 07:13.718
That shit ain't real.

07:13.751 --> 07:15.619
This is not the world in here.

07:15.653 --> 07:18.789
I think Trendible's 50 million
unique visitors per day

07:18.823 --> 07:20.224
would say otherwise there,
Hamster.

07:20.257 --> 07:23.561
Oh, please, I can get you
15 million more viewers.

07:23.594 --> 07:24.362
Really?

07:24.395 --> 07:26.297
And I can show you
the real city.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.631
Hamster's city.

07:27.665 --> 07:29.033
Can you see it
in your mind right now?

07:29.066 --> 07:31.534
You see it?
Tell me can you see it?

07:31.569 --> 07:33.237
Alright, alright.

07:33.270 --> 07:37.174
We'll set you up with
a temporary creator account.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.844
Show me something cool.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.946
And if it works, we'll hire you.

07:41.979 --> 07:44.682
Really?
Really.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.118
Really? Okay. Okay.

07:47.151 --> 07:50.187
Hey, look, see,
now you in Hamster's world now.

07:50.221 --> 07:51.022
Okay.

07:51.055 --> 07:53.090
I won't disappoint you.
I promise.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.925
I will shake you up.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.894
Splash!

07:56.927 --> 07:59.597
Every story is coming to you.

07:59.630 --> 08:00.965
Alright.

08:31.062 --> 08:34.331
O-74. O-74.

08:39.403 --> 08:43.174
O-63. O-63.

08:47.978 --> 08:51.115
Go ahead.
I'm not fucking stupid. Okay?

08:57.288 --> 09:00.124
A bitch can't have
personal protection?

09:00.157 --> 09:02.793
Okay, maybe when I'm mute,
bare-handed killer

09:02.827 --> 09:06.163
like your crazy ass,
I won't have to weaponize.

09:15.739 --> 09:19.610
Indigo, my little
blue raspberry.

09:21.679 --> 09:23.080
How's business?

09:23.114 --> 09:25.850
Business needs to get better.

09:25.883 --> 09:28.252
Here's what I'm thinking.

09:28.285 --> 09:31.956
I think we start dealing
to the little ones.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.124
The preschoolers.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.659
The fucking sippy cup crowd.

09:35.693 --> 09:38.129
They're old enough to download
porn onto their iPads.

09:38.162 --> 09:40.898
I think they're old enough
to get high.

09:40.931 --> 09:42.700
What do you say, huh?

09:42.733 --> 09:46.270
Throw on a little princess
outfit, get on the corner.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.444
I'm fucking joking.

09:53.477 --> 09:56.046
Lighten up.

10:01.719 --> 10:03.287
Did I ever tell you

10:03.320 --> 10:06.257
that I wanted to be a musician
when I was younger?

10:06.290 --> 10:08.759
- No.
- No?

10:08.792 --> 10:13.164
Yeah, I wanted to be a singer,
actually. Yeah.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.932
I even got a gig once.

10:14.965 --> 10:17.168
Worked out five little songs.

10:17.201 --> 10:20.037
Puked after two.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.906
Got paid 7 bucks.

10:21.939 --> 10:27.077
I figured there's got to be
a better way to make a living.

10:27.111 --> 10:32.850
So now, when I want
to hear people clap,

10:32.883 --> 10:35.886
I just say clap.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.790
They can never say
you didn't crack the code, huh?

10:39.823 --> 10:43.060
I crack fucking skulls, too.

10:43.093 --> 10:45.296
You wanted to see me
about something?

10:45.329 --> 10:47.932
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:47.965 --> 10:50.367
I make money for you now.
Yes?

10:50.401 --> 10:53.337
But I want to make you
even more money.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.239
I was thinking I can
carve out larger parts

10:55.272 --> 10:58.108
of the neighborhood.
I can oversee people.

10:58.142 --> 10:59.977
Who are you going to oversee,
huh?

11:00.010 --> 11:01.979
The fucking ice cream man?

11:04.215 --> 11:07.851
They are slacking
on those fucking blocks.

11:07.885 --> 11:10.788
They are just waiting for
the money to fall from the sky.

11:10.821 --> 11:13.290
Not me.
See, I want to make it rain.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.327
You give me more blocks,
I'll turn them around.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.761
We should be expanding.

11:17.795 --> 11:20.497
We should be going
viral with it.

11:20.531 --> 11:22.233
- Viral.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.768
- You want to go viral?
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.802 --> 11:26.403
Hmm.

11:31.242 --> 11:33.244
You know, I've always liked you.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.945
You work hard.

11:34.979 --> 11:36.747
Fucking smart.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.819
I'll tell you what.

11:41.852 --> 11:45.122
I'd like to try you out
on something.

11:45.155 --> 11:50.094
Now, this may surprise you,
but I've got a boss, too,

11:50.127 --> 11:53.364
and the boss likes to know that
things run smoothly around here.

11:53.397 --> 11:56.433
I got to make sure things
are in tip-top shape.

11:59.169 --> 12:00.871
I want you start
with Jimmy Krieg.

12:00.904 --> 12:03.107
- You know Jimmy Krieg?
- Yeah, I've seen him around.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.308
He's a player, whatever.

12:04.341 --> 12:06.543
Don't act all fuckin blasé.

12:06.578 --> 12:08.145
I think you know
as well as I do

12:08.178 --> 12:12.816
the Jimmy Krieg is a high roller
and a fucking psychopath.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.152
I didn't ask for a job
at the team biscuit shop.

12:15.185 --> 12:17.521
Go to Krieg.
He's got money of mine.

12:17.555 --> 12:19.456
Or at least he fucking better.

12:19.490 --> 12:21.258
You pick up the money,
bring it back to me.

12:21.292 --> 12:24.161
But I want him to trust you

12:24.194 --> 12:25.529
and I want you
to report back to me

12:25.563 --> 12:28.299
does he say anything weird?

12:30.334 --> 12:33.470
I appreciate the opportunity.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.105
I've always been
good to you, right?

12:35.139 --> 12:38.442
♪ I can't jump high
but I hear all the notes ♪

12:38.475 --> 12:40.344
To you and your family.

12:52.624 --> 12:55.426
Guess who's Trendible's
newest star reporter.

12:55.459 --> 12:57.061
- Yo.
- What?

12:57.094 --> 12:58.596
Where the fuck you been, Hams?

12:58.630 --> 13:01.432
Making moves,
trying to get paid.

13:01.465 --> 13:03.067
Don't make moves, okay?

13:03.100 --> 13:04.401
<i>I</i> make moves.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.471
You keep safe while I make them,
okay?

13:07.504 --> 13:10.107
Come on, man.

13:10.140 --> 13:13.077
And you cracked your phone.

13:13.110 --> 13:15.312
You're so clumsy, kooky kid.

13:15.346 --> 13:16.447
I know, okay?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.115
Look, just give it back.
It's okay.

13:18.148 --> 13:19.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:19.383 --> 13:21.619
Why are you sharing photos
of drug dealers?

13:21.653 --> 13:23.420
- He's just my boy.
- Can you imagine

13:23.454 --> 13:25.356
what would happen if this
gets back to the Manager?

13:25.389 --> 13:27.491
It's just stories, Indy.

13:27.524 --> 13:30.227
I'm trying to
put something out there.

13:30.260 --> 13:33.330
But you wouldn't know shit
about that.

13:33.364 --> 13:35.667
So you must think that
I like this shit...

13:35.700 --> 13:38.902
acting hard,
dealing with these people.

13:38.936 --> 13:40.270
No.

13:40.304 --> 13:41.538
Listen to me.

13:41.573 --> 13:43.641
I'm trying to get you to college
like Dad wanted,

13:43.675 --> 13:45.376
and then I'm out
of this hell game.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.111
I dropped out of high school.

13:47.144 --> 13:48.613
Now, how you expect
to put me in a college?

13:48.646 --> 13:51.915
Do you not watch the news?
It's a fucking scam.

13:51.949 --> 13:54.518
You give them enough money
and they let your ass in.

13:54.552 --> 13:56.120
You're getting
college scam money?

13:56.153 --> 13:57.988
- Yeah.
- This is my life.

13:58.021 --> 14:00.491
Life ain't no
crime reporter bullshit,

14:00.524 --> 14:02.526
because that's dangerous.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.662
A lot of people
want to keep a low profile.

14:04.696 --> 14:05.563
I know I do.

14:05.597 --> 14:07.531
A woman who wants
to keep a low profile

14:07.565 --> 14:09.634
doesn't wear her hair
that color.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.268
I can't help that
I'm a sugar plum fairy

14:11.301 --> 14:14.138
interstellar princess.
That's who I am.

14:14.171 --> 14:15.539
And this is who I am.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.126
Dad was a storyteller.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.461
You remember that shit?

14:37.494 --> 14:41.465
He would come up with
crazy stuff to tell us.

14:41.498 --> 14:43.668
I wish I could remember.

14:45.603 --> 14:50.407
He had this one ongoing saga
about these two ravens

14:50.441 --> 14:52.443
that would fly around the world,

14:52.476 --> 14:55.045
picking up tiny gold chains
out of jewelry boxes

14:55.078 --> 14:59.049
because they were
building a golden nest.

14:59.082 --> 15:02.085
Maybe that's where
you get it from.

15:02.119 --> 15:05.155
See, it's in our blood.

15:05.189 --> 15:06.624
We're fucking storytellers.

15:06.658 --> 15:10.695
- Okay, Shakespeare.
- You... You just did it.

15:10.728 --> 15:12.597
- Come on.
- Whatever, whatever.

15:12.630 --> 15:16.366
I made you something.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.669
It's a recipe I cooked up

15:17.702 --> 15:20.037
because I love keeping
my little brother alive.

15:20.070 --> 15:22.473
Okay.
That looks... What?

15:22.506 --> 15:24.141
What is that?

15:24.174 --> 15:25.743
Spirulina balls.

15:25.777 --> 15:29.012
Superfood.
It'll keep you hyped.

15:32.082 --> 15:35.052
Tell me I'm the best sister
you ever had.

15:38.790 --> 15:40.792
Keep the change.

15:40.825 --> 15:42.526
Good night, amigo.

15:54.438 --> 15:58.141
I can see right through you.

16:02.246 --> 16:06.216
Hey, yo, uh, what'd the wall
ever do to you, man?

16:07.518 --> 16:09.654
Bet it owes you money, huh?

16:09.687 --> 16:11.054
The wall is an asshole, man.

16:11.088 --> 16:12.590
Look, it deserves
what's coming to it.

16:12.624 --> 16:18.295
I used to punch holes
through space-time.

16:18.328 --> 16:21.031
Oh, really? Oh.

16:26.303 --> 16:28.405
- Hey!
- Oh!

16:28.438 --> 16:30.140
Hey, I heard about you, man.

16:30.173 --> 16:33.277
You're the dude who says
he's from another planet.

16:33.310 --> 16:34.712
You got superpowers, right?

16:34.746 --> 16:37.649
It's not a planet. It's a city.

16:37.682 --> 16:40.150
Yeah,
I seen you around.

16:40.183 --> 16:42.587
You say you can fly.

16:42.620 --> 16:45.222
Come on, I just want to hear
your story.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.390
I'm a writer.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.059
Listen, man,
the people want to know.

17:03.307 --> 17:06.310
Hey, man. Hey.

17:06.343 --> 17:07.712
Get off the street.

17:07.745 --> 17:09.513
Are you still alive?

17:09.546 --> 17:12.149
Oh! Oh, no.

17:12.182 --> 17:13.751
Whoa, come on, man.

17:13.785 --> 17:15.720
I was trying to get you
out the street.

17:15.753 --> 17:17.855
These dicks were going to
run over your head.

17:17.889 --> 17:20.357
No bueno.

17:20.390 --> 17:21.458
Man, you going to be okay?

17:21.491 --> 17:25.495
Shit.

17:25.529 --> 17:28.532
We need to get you
to the hospital.

17:28.566 --> 17:32.536
They don't understand
my biology.

17:32.570 --> 17:35.573
You got to drink this.
Need to hydrate.

17:53.591 --> 17:57.361
Max Fist.

17:57.394 --> 18:00.798
Hamster City's cosmic crusader.

18:00.832 --> 18:02.499
We don't know
what he's fighting,

18:02.532 --> 18:04.501
but we know he's lit.

18:04.534 --> 18:07.504
On the streets, on the rooftops.

18:07.537 --> 18:09.774
Fist is fire.

18:13.477 --> 18:15.913
Hamster City heroes.

18:15.947 --> 18:17.347
Splash!

18:29.594 --> 18:32.830
Max?

18:37.334 --> 18:38.803
Max?

18:44.441 --> 18:46.209
Max.

18:47.444 --> 18:48.412
Who the fuck are you?

18:48.445 --> 18:50.815
I found you, man.

18:50.848 --> 18:52.950
I brought you some stuff, man.

18:52.984 --> 18:55.720
Check it out.
Got some coffee, some beer.

18:56.621 --> 18:57.755
I know you like beer.

18:57.789 --> 18:59.791
Hey, I paid for that.

19:05.328 --> 19:09.332
I got some food in there, too.
Twinkies.

19:09.366 --> 19:10.702
Okay.

19:10.735 --> 19:12.770
Figured you'd tell me your story
if you had a snack.

19:12.804 --> 19:16.607
I guess beer's the one.

19:26.918 --> 19:28.720
You know, I used to sit on top

19:28.753 --> 19:30.788
of the highest buildings
in Chromium,

19:30.822 --> 19:34.291
thousands of feet up,

19:34.324 --> 19:36.393
and look down like a god.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.696
Hell, I'd hover on the edge
of a black hole

19:38.730 --> 19:41.966
and dare it to pull me in.

19:43.634 --> 19:48.873
Here, I'd crush myself against
the Earth with one wrong twitch.

19:50.041 --> 19:54.444
Chromium?
So that's where you're from?

19:54.478 --> 19:56.279
What are you,
some kind of kid reporter?

19:56.313 --> 19:58.716
I bring it to life.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.051
Hey, you ever heard
of Hunter Thompson?

20:00.084 --> 20:01.318
I don't think we had one of him.

20:01.351 --> 20:03.621
He fully dove into
the worlds that he wrote about.

20:03.654 --> 20:06.591
I mean, he was crazier than
the crazies he was profiling.

20:06.624 --> 20:08.726
Gonzo.

20:10.427 --> 20:13.798
Yeah, we had a guy like that.
The Spider.

20:13.831 --> 20:16.500
He could beam crime scene
investigation reports

20:16.533 --> 20:18.035
straight into your brain.

20:18.069 --> 20:19.771
That's what I'm talking about.

20:19.804 --> 20:20.938
That's splash-worthy.

20:20.972 --> 20:23.908
- Splash-worthy?
- Yeah.

20:23.941 --> 20:26.611
I'll tell you what, you get me
something to eat

20:26.644 --> 20:28.946
and some whiskey,

20:28.980 --> 20:30.915
I'll bring it to life for you.

20:30.948 --> 20:33.851
So my archenemy, Cleo Vantrik,

20:33.885 --> 20:37.622
she had a doomsday device
called the Void Machine.

20:37.655 --> 20:39.322
It was going to kill everybody.

20:39.356 --> 20:41.626
And so I did the only thing
that I thought was possible,

20:41.659 --> 20:46.831
which... you... Do you know
anything about string theory?

20:46.864 --> 20:49.734
Okay. Uh...

20:49.767 --> 20:51.903
Shit.

20:51.936 --> 20:55.039
Alright, look, do you have
any superpowers at all?

20:55.072 --> 20:57.474
You know anybody that does?

20:57.507 --> 21:02.079
Look, kid, the source of
my power doesn't exist here.

21:02.113 --> 21:06.416
It's not like it's
like a billion miles away.

21:06.449 --> 21:09.086
It's... It's imaginary.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.454
The square root
of negative one...

21:11.488 --> 21:13.090
fucking impossible.

21:13.124 --> 21:15.560
Wait, imaginary
like it's not real?

21:15.593 --> 21:17.662
Not real here.

21:17.695 --> 21:18.930
You understand me?

21:18.963 --> 21:21.065
He could fly.
He could punch.

21:21.098 --> 21:23.533
He could shoot elephants
out of his ass.

21:23.568 --> 21:25.703
Why you got to fill
the kid's head with bullshit?

21:25.736 --> 21:28.906
Come on, man. Look, just keep
his fucking glass filled.

21:30.942 --> 21:34.745
So you were super strong,
but what could hurt you?

21:35.046 --> 21:37.915
They had to invent things
to hurt me.

21:37.949 --> 21:40.550
Solar guns,
intelligent asteroids,

21:40.585 --> 21:42.019
big fucking killer robots,

21:42.053 --> 21:43.788
whatever Cleo could
come up with.

21:43.821 --> 21:45.388
Even the whiskey's weaker here.

21:45.422 --> 21:46.757
That's why I can drink
so much of it.

21:46.791 --> 21:47.859
Space whiskey.

21:49.426 --> 21:51.028
So were you always like that
or...?

21:51.062 --> 21:52.663
I started out normal.

21:52.697 --> 21:55.733
I worked for a task force
that managed the cosmic blood

21:55.766 --> 21:57.735
and monitored cosmic events,

21:57.768 --> 21:59.502
threats we didn't know
how to handle.

21:59.536 --> 22:01.538
Because of supervillains?

22:01.572 --> 22:02.840
Say super one more fucking time.

22:02.874 --> 22:04.942
O-O-Okay.
But that's what you mean, right?

22:04.976 --> 22:09.947
No. You have to understand
about the cosmic blood.

22:09.981 --> 22:12.049
See, it was just starting
to leak in at that point.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.051
What does cosmic blood
even mean?

22:14.085 --> 22:15.753
What does that...
What does that mean?

22:15.786 --> 22:17.822
It's the difference between
Chromium and this shit hole.

22:17.855 --> 22:19.957
The cosmic blood...

22:19.991 --> 22:22.960
It came from something called
the cosmic source,

22:22.994 --> 22:25.763
which is a black hole
the size of 12 billion suns

22:25.796 --> 22:28.733
hovering on the edge
of my universe.

22:28.766 --> 22:31.501
It started making people weird.

22:31.534 --> 22:33.838
Weird?

22:33.871 --> 22:36.641
Ah, fuck it.
You can't even understand it.

22:36.674 --> 22:38.075
This place, your...

22:38.109 --> 22:40.945
your gravity,
your dirty atmosphere,

22:40.978 --> 22:44.749
it's added 15 years to my body.

22:44.782 --> 22:47.985
Imagine what it's like to wake
up one day and just be old.

22:54.091 --> 22:56.794
I need you to secure
the reactor.

22:56.827 --> 22:57.929
There's something
right here.

23:00.998 --> 23:03.901
Fuck there's a...
Get out of the source!

24:18.642 --> 24:19.910
Oh, my God.

24:19.944 --> 24:25.116
The power coursing
through my molecules.

24:34.825 --> 24:37.194
Max.

24:41.999 --> 24:45.336
The Crystal Fist.

24:45.369 --> 24:50.708
It chose me so that I could
help them defend Chromium.

24:50.741 --> 24:54.945
Then Cleo tried to kill everyone
with the Void Machine.

24:54.979 --> 24:57.081
And I wound up here.

25:08.793 --> 25:11.195
So could you find Chromium
on, like, a map

25:11.228 --> 25:12.763
of the universe or something?

25:12.797 --> 25:14.231
I didn't fly through space.

25:14.265 --> 25:16.934
Came through the membranes
of reality.

25:16.967 --> 25:20.204
Same planet,
different universe.

25:20.237 --> 25:22.606
This is a dimmer
fucking universe.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.075
Did you guys have, like,
the Grand Canyon

25:24.108 --> 25:26.043
or did you have McDonald's
or something?

25:26.077 --> 25:27.244
I got to be honest,
I haven't done

25:27.278 --> 25:30.347
a lot of exploring
of your grim rock.

25:30.381 --> 25:33.784
Theoretically, it should all be
the same up to the divergence.

25:33.818 --> 25:35.953
Okay, so if it's basically
the same, right,

25:35.986 --> 25:37.354
then we should
be able to find it here.

25:37.388 --> 25:39.256
Like if you could give me
coordinates, we could see

25:39.290 --> 25:42.159
- if the Crystal Cave is here.
- Yeah, but it's not the same.

25:42.193 --> 25:44.261
Okay, but if it was the same,
we could see exactly

25:44.295 --> 25:45.930
where the Crystal Cave
would be here.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.631
- There's no chance. No.
- Well, then, listen,

25:47.665 --> 25:49.166
let's just pretend
for a minute that it's possible.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.402
It's not fucking pretend, okay?

25:51.435 --> 25:53.237
You're recording me,
but you're not listening.

25:53.270 --> 25:56.373
You don't...
You're not hearing me.

26:01.178 --> 26:03.380
I wasn't trying to upset you.

28:21.018 --> 28:27.024
I am here today
not because you love me

28:27.057 --> 28:31.495
but because I love you.

28:33.831 --> 28:38.902
I love Chromium,
and I will never leave you.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.952
Krieg, it's Indigo.

29:04.295 --> 29:07.331
Yo, Krieg, the Manager sent me.

29:13.203 --> 29:15.172
They sent you?

29:15.205 --> 29:17.274
The Manager.

29:17.308 --> 29:18.976
- What?
- The Manager sent me

29:19.009 --> 29:20.911
to pick something up from you.

29:20.944 --> 29:23.547
Oh. I thought you were here
to kill me.

29:23.581 --> 29:24.915
Come in.

29:24.948 --> 29:26.550
Quick, quick, quick.

29:33.424 --> 29:34.925
- You smoke?
- Nah.

29:34.958 --> 29:35.694
-Pills...

29:35.727 --> 29:37.461
- you like pills, right?
- Nah.

29:37.494 --> 29:40.064
Yeah, I don't know what it is
about this fucking town,

29:40.097 --> 29:41.566
but every time I'm here,

29:41.599 --> 29:46.337
I get this irresistible urge
to just get fucking wasted.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.472
Yeah. Imagine growing up here,
you know?

29:48.505 --> 29:50.507
- Let me tell you something.
- Mm-hmm.

29:50.541 --> 29:54.111
Okay, you don't fuck
with people, okay?

29:54.144 --> 29:55.446
I didn't fuck with anybody.

29:55.479 --> 29:57.214
This is not my job.

29:57.247 --> 29:59.249
I'm here to make shit go cool.

29:59.283 --> 30:00.551
- Okay?
- Yeah.

30:00.585 --> 30:03.320
Alright. I'm not dying
for anyone's sins, okay?

30:03.354 --> 30:06.090
I'm not dying for anyone's sins.
Not here.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.296
You know,
it's like... like snakes.

30:12.329 --> 30:14.398
Here's the thing about snakes.

30:14.431 --> 30:17.101
They only live within
a five-mile radius

30:17.134 --> 30:18.369
of where they were born.

30:18.402 --> 30:21.004
Did you know that?
Yeah. Check this out.

30:21.038 --> 30:23.073
Bam.

30:23.107 --> 30:24.508
Snakeskin boots.

30:24.541 --> 30:26.977
That way, I'm always home

30:27.010 --> 30:30.648
even when I'm out of fucking
town in this shit hole.

30:30.682 --> 30:34.184
I thought you was from
around here.

30:34.218 --> 30:36.987
Want some?

30:37.020 --> 30:38.355
Nah.

30:38.389 --> 30:41.091
What the fuck, a'ight?

30:41.125 --> 30:42.660
I offer you something.

30:42.694 --> 30:45.262
I offer you something
in my house,

30:45.295 --> 30:47.264
and you should take it.

30:47.297 --> 30:48.999
Okay. Fuck.

30:49.032 --> 30:51.535
Now... Now here's what
I don't understand, though.

30:51.569 --> 30:54.639
You said that you thought
that I was from here,

30:54.672 --> 30:57.241
which means
that you put thought into it.

30:57.274 --> 30:59.276
About me.

30:59.309 --> 31:02.546
Should I be worried?

31:02.580 --> 31:05.549
Relax. It's my job.

31:05.583 --> 31:08.285
- Your job.
- Mm-hmm.

31:08.318 --> 31:11.288
That's my job too.

31:11.321 --> 31:15.025
My job to worry.

31:15.058 --> 31:19.029
Okay. Okay,
we'll try this again.

31:19.062 --> 31:23.267
You want some?

31:23.300 --> 31:25.502
I'm good, man.

31:25.536 --> 31:28.539
Okay, well, then we're going
to fucking play a game.

31:28.573 --> 31:31.308
Alright, Johnny,
what do we got?

31:31.341 --> 31:32.577
Oh!

31:32.610 --> 31:35.245
No. Don't be fucking wack.

31:35.279 --> 31:36.714
Here? Here?

31:36.748 --> 31:38.282
Am I wack?

31:41.686 --> 31:43.588
No bullets. You should have seen
the look on your face.

31:43.621 --> 31:45.590
Look at that. No bullets.

31:45.623 --> 31:48.660
I got you.
No, no, no, no, no.

31:48.693 --> 31:53.731
Now, this, this is a bullet.

31:53.765 --> 31:55.065
And...

31:58.302 --> 32:00.170
Madame.

32:00.204 --> 32:02.406
No, man.

32:02.439 --> 32:05.075
At this point,

32:05.108 --> 32:07.077
you got to fucking do it.

32:07.110 --> 32:10.080
Or I'm gonna think this whole
goddamn thing is a setup.

32:10.113 --> 32:13.050
Then I have to get angry.

32:24.127 --> 32:24.896
Bang!

32:24.929 --> 32:29.634
No. No, no, no, no, no.

32:29.667 --> 32:32.770
I want you to put it
to your head

32:32.804 --> 32:35.740
and pull the fucking trigger.

32:38.676 --> 32:40.645
Come on.

32:46.316 --> 32:50.555
Oh, fuck.

32:50.588 --> 32:52.523
Fucking shit!

32:52.557 --> 32:54.391
Good fucking shit.

32:54.424 --> 32:55.660
Did you see that?

32:55.693 --> 32:58.495
God damn it.

32:58.529 --> 32:59.764
You actually did it.

32:59.797 --> 33:02.567
Girl, you are fucked...
What's your name?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.067
- Indigo.
- Indigo.

33:04.101 --> 33:05.402
Fuck, Indigo.

33:05.435 --> 33:08.773
Indigo, you are
a fucking crazy bitch

33:08.806 --> 33:10.474
because you were just
sitting here like

33:10.507 --> 33:11.542
"I'm just gonna put this gun ..."

33:37.434 --> 33:38.603
Fuck.

33:48.145 --> 33:49.479
Man.

34:21.946 --> 34:23.748
Does the kid know

34:23.781 --> 34:27.217
you're just a schizophrenic
that lives under a bridge?

34:33.891 --> 34:36.360
You'll never be free of me.

34:36.393 --> 34:37.527
Never.

34:37.562 --> 34:38.930
You'll never be free of me.

34:38.963 --> 34:42.567
Never.
You'll never be free of me.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.501
Like I'll never be free of you.

34:44.534 --> 34:47.204
And I'll never be free of you.

34:47.237 --> 34:50.374
That's why I'm building
the Void Machine.

34:50.407 --> 34:54.411
So we can get back to
who we really are.

34:54.444 --> 34:56.313
Together.

35:10.962 --> 35:13.163
She's here.

35:34.451 --> 35:36.253
Police are all over the place.

35:36.286 --> 35:38.589
Couldn't even get near it,
you know?

35:38.623 --> 35:40.658
- And I just, uh...
- Okay.

35:40.692 --> 35:43.260
I don't understand
what you're telling me.

35:46.263 --> 35:49.499
Krieg offed himself.

35:49.533 --> 35:50.935
Mm.

35:50.968 --> 35:55.439
And you know that for a fact?

35:55.472 --> 35:56.774
Yeah.

35:56.808 --> 35:59.610
A guy dies with $300,000
of my money missing,

35:59.644 --> 36:01.713
and we assume that the cops,

36:01.746 --> 36:04.749
motherfucking
law-enforcement officials,

36:04.782 --> 36:07.517
are a trustworthy source
of information?

36:07.551 --> 36:09.020
Well, it's not...

36:09.053 --> 36:12.489
I got the police report
right here.

36:12.522 --> 36:14.357
Police report.

36:14.391 --> 36:16.794
You got the...

36:16.828 --> 36:19.329
Give me that.

36:19.362 --> 36:22.633
Come on, let me see.

36:24.736 --> 36:25.970
Let me see.

36:31.609 --> 36:32.777
Oh, here?

36:32.810 --> 36:34.277
Right up in there.

36:35.646 --> 36:37.782
Oh.

36:46.356 --> 36:47.692
Open your mouth.

36:47.725 --> 36:49.026
What?

36:50.561 --> 36:56.701
I said open your fucking mouth!

37:13.584 --> 37:15.686
What did Indigo say?

37:15.720 --> 37:17.487
- Who?
- Indigo,

37:17.521 --> 37:18.556
the nutty broad with the hair.

37:18.589 --> 37:19.791
She was supposed to go meet him.

37:19.824 --> 37:21.324
If Krieg came to town
without my money,

37:21.358 --> 37:23.828
that means I got to send
you guys to kill his guys.

37:23.861 --> 37:28.866
So before I do that,
talk to her.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.701
See if she knows anything.

37:30.735 --> 37:32.302
Okay.

37:40.711 --> 37:41.846
Well, hello.

37:41.879 --> 37:43.047
Glad you want to visit
our little nook.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.817
It'll be nice
to finally meet you.

37:47.118 --> 37:49.554
Well, that's much sooner
than I had expected.

37:49.587 --> 37:52.322
Is there some kind of a problem
bringing you here?

37:56.093 --> 37:57.929
Of course.

38:22.687 --> 38:25.890
Who the fuck is Max Fist?

38:33.865 --> 38:36.601
Fist Fact 15...
Max's Crystal Fist

38:36.634 --> 38:38.135
was stronger than a diamond.

38:38.169 --> 38:41.504
Fist Fact 57... Chromium was
powered by the cosmic source.

38:41.538 --> 38:44.609
Fist Fact 23... Cleo Vantrik
was the smartest person...

38:44.642 --> 38:47.111
The longest Max traveled
at one time was 200...

38:47.144 --> 38:50.547
Fist Fact 100... On Chromium,
Max's blood was blue.

38:50.581 --> 38:53.818
Hamster, the Max Fist posts
are getting insane numbers.

38:53.851 --> 38:55.452
Word.

38:55.485 --> 38:57.955
Keep this up and
we'll bring you on full-time.

38:57.989 --> 39:00.958
Hey, why don't you
fight crime here?

39:00.992 --> 39:05.062
I've been through the fucking
cosmic tendrils of time.

39:05.096 --> 39:09.133
Seen the universe through the
prism of 11-dimensional space.

39:11.235 --> 39:13.571
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

39:13.604 --> 39:14.939
Yeah, yeah, I get what you mean,

39:14.972 --> 39:17.708
but, you know, you did
punch a lot of people too.

39:18.976 --> 39:20.011
I mean, you killed all

39:20.044 --> 39:22.545
- the bad guys, man.
- No, I didn't kill anyone.

39:23.681 --> 39:25.783
That was a rule.

39:25.816 --> 39:28.953
I inspired people
with my strength.

39:28.986 --> 39:32.522
That's beautiful, Max.

39:32.556 --> 39:37.862
The Crystal Cave was the source
of Max's power on Chromium.

39:37.895 --> 39:39.664
But there's got to be
something on Earth

39:39.697 --> 39:41.632
in the same coordinates.

39:41.666 --> 39:43.034
I don't know what it is,

39:43.067 --> 39:46.971
but I know
it'll be splash-worthy.

39:51.976 --> 39:55.813
Fucking shopping mall.

39:55.846 --> 39:57.815
It's a different
parallel world, right?

39:57.848 --> 40:02.620
Cemented over the Crystal Cave
with a fucking shopping mall.

40:04.055 --> 40:05.823
Let's just get some shovels
and dig this shit up.

40:05.856 --> 40:07.558
I'm so sorry.

40:11.128 --> 40:14.665
Sorry. Sorry, I just...

40:16.000 --> 40:19.737
I just wanted you to see.
It's beautiful.

40:19.770 --> 40:21.538
It's just...

40:21.572 --> 40:24.507
- What the fuck is with this car?
- Asshole.

40:24.541 --> 40:26.877
Fuck you!

40:34.885 --> 40:36.687
Yo, what you gonna do with that?

40:38.089 --> 40:40.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get out the fucking way, man.

40:52.269 --> 40:53.771
♪ He's a hundred,
gonna break something ♪

40:53.804 --> 40:55.272
♪ He's a hundred,
gonna break something ♪

40:55.306 --> 40:59.944
♪ He's a hundred,
gonna break something ♪

41:05.082 --> 41:08.052
Fuck you! Fuck you!

41:13.190 --> 41:15.893
Are you okay?

41:15.926 --> 41:18.029
Do you need water?

41:18.062 --> 41:19.830
Do you... Okay, do you need any
space whiskey?

41:19.864 --> 41:21.032
Come on, man.

41:21.065 --> 41:23.300
Max Fist versus car.

41:23.334 --> 41:26.637
My man faces down a metal beast
in the savage land.

41:26.670 --> 41:29.006
Now that's the heart of a hero
right there.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.842
Oh, my God.
I got that on video.

41:33.110 --> 41:37.348
Indigo, it's Finn.
Manager sent me.

41:41.685 --> 41:42.553
Hey.

41:42.586 --> 41:44.922
Mind if we come in
for a quick chat?

41:44.955 --> 41:46.757
Yeah.

41:51.629 --> 41:54.899
Cute place. Really cute.

41:54.932 --> 41:58.235
- You need anything?
- No, I'm good.

42:00.237 --> 42:02.039
I like your pants.

42:02.073 --> 42:04.075
Thanks.

42:04.108 --> 42:06.010
Hey, Decker, how about
this "Alice in Wonderland"

42:06.043 --> 42:09.747
thing she's got going on?
Isn't it beautiful?

42:09.780 --> 42:12.983
So... So, what do you know
about Krieg?

42:13.017 --> 42:18.155
I was supposed to get something
from him for the Manager.

42:18.189 --> 42:20.324
But I haven't yet.

42:20.357 --> 42:23.661
Do you want something?
Water, beer?

42:23.694 --> 42:25.162
You didn't have a chance?

42:28.999 --> 42:32.169
When I went to the hotel,
he didn't answer.

42:32.203 --> 42:34.638
'Cause he was dead.

42:34.672 --> 42:36.140
What?

42:37.007 --> 42:39.844
Come here.

42:39.877 --> 42:41.745
Come, come on, come over here.

42:56.427 --> 42:58.929
Don't worry.

42:58.963 --> 43:02.166
I'm not here because I think
that you did anything.

43:03.901 --> 43:05.703
He killed himself.

43:07.271 --> 43:09.807
Strangest goddamn thing.

43:09.840 --> 43:13.811
Shit.

43:13.844 --> 43:16.814
And I just don't get it.

43:16.847 --> 43:22.052
You know, I mean,
you live this gritty life.

43:22.086 --> 43:24.421
I don't know, like this life...

43:26.357 --> 43:28.259
...of violence is meant
to deflect away

43:28.292 --> 43:30.394
from, like, the agony of self,
you know?

43:35.065 --> 43:36.800
Anyway,

43:36.834 --> 43:40.271
so I just wanted to know
if you knew anything about it.

43:45.876 --> 43:49.713
You don't think he was
stealing from the Manager or...?

43:52.516 --> 43:54.351
You look worried.

43:58.822 --> 44:00.457
Are you worried?

44:00.491 --> 44:05.129
It's just weird.

44:05.162 --> 44:08.265
Yeah, that's what I thought,
too, you know.

44:12.102 --> 44:13.737
Weird.

44:24.315 --> 44:26.784
We're going to take off.

44:26.817 --> 44:29.820
Now, do me a favor,
keep your ear to the ground,

44:29.853 --> 44:30.689
- okay?
- Yeah.

44:30.721 --> 44:33.057
Manager's going to
fuck me in the ass

44:33.090 --> 44:34.959
if I don't come up
with an answer.

44:34.992 --> 44:37.761
You know, he's got somebody
coming into town or something.

44:44.335 --> 44:47.738
Hey, can I use your bathroom?

44:51.242 --> 44:52.910
Thanks.

45:01.151 --> 45:03.287
Dude, you're a monster.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.256
Man, how do you survive
getting hit by a car

45:05.289 --> 45:06.991
and then just keep rolling?

45:07.024 --> 45:11.161
I've faced down fast-moving
certain death a thousand times.

45:11.195 --> 45:14.999
Just stay calm and jump.

45:15.032 --> 45:16.367
Look, check this out.

45:16.400 --> 45:19.970
"Max Fist Versus Muscle Car."

45:20.004 --> 45:21.272
A lot of people see those?

45:21.305 --> 45:23.007
Hell yeah.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.009
Like, people all over?

45:25.042 --> 45:27.911
Dude, you're going to be famous.

45:27.945 --> 45:31.282
Come on, man.
You must've scared everybody.

45:31.315 --> 45:33.884
No, I had to scare Cleo.

45:33.917 --> 45:37.187
She had to think that I was
a force that would never stop,

45:37.221 --> 45:39.023
never.

45:39.056 --> 45:41.593
Oh, this is you?

45:41.626 --> 45:43.127
Yeah, man.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.596
It's the Hamster Nest.

45:44.629 --> 45:47.131
Oh, stay calm.

45:47.164 --> 45:48.832
And jump.

45:48.866 --> 45:50.200
Splash.

46:09.554 --> 46:15.025
Did the Manager say
anything about me?

46:15.059 --> 46:17.595
Like about a promotion or...?

46:21.999 --> 46:23.934
When did you say
you went to the hotel?

46:37.314 --> 46:39.249
She had it.

46:42.986 --> 46:45.022
- You took the money?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

46:45.055 --> 46:46.390
Wait, wait, wait!

46:46.423 --> 46:47.625
You took the money, huh?

46:47.659 --> 46:49.594
Tell me you took the money!

46:49.627 --> 46:52.996
Say it! You took the money!
Say it! Say you took the money!

46:53.030 --> 46:54.431
Yes!

46:54.465 --> 46:55.999
God damn it.

47:00.404 --> 47:02.106
Decker, put him down.

47:02.139 --> 47:04.642
- No! Stop! Please!
- No, no, no! Please!

47:06.477 --> 47:09.513
Hams! Hams, help!

47:09.546 --> 47:11.014
Get off of me!

47:11.048 --> 47:12.449
Hamster!

47:21.191 --> 47:22.893
Behind you!

47:33.170 --> 47:35.973
You grab the money.

47:36.006 --> 47:37.609
We got to go.

47:37.642 --> 47:39.977
I thought
you didn't kill people.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.295
He's gonna send
more people.

47:58.328 --> 48:01.498
The Manager.

48:01.532 --> 48:03.500
The Manager. That's his name?

48:03.534 --> 48:05.436
What are his powers?

48:05.469 --> 48:09.440
I mean, what's his
threat level assessment?

48:09.473 --> 48:12.109
How can you be
a so-called fucking superhero

48:12.142 --> 48:14.077
and you don't know who runs
crime in this town?

48:14.111 --> 48:16.547
- I'm not a fucking superhero.
- He's not a superhero.

48:41.405 --> 48:44.274
We should camp here.

48:44.308 --> 48:48.580
Give us time to strategize
before we go back after them.

48:48.613 --> 48:51.215
We're not going after anybody.

48:51.248 --> 48:53.217
We're running. Come on.

48:53.250 --> 48:55.352
W... Where are we going to go?

48:55.385 --> 48:57.054
They're just gonna hunt us down.

48:57.087 --> 48:58.756
Max didn't have to do
any of this to help us.

48:58.790 --> 49:02.359
You're risking our lives to
hang out with some homeless man?

49:02.392 --> 49:03.628
You don't know him like I do.

49:03.661 --> 49:05.195
You're the one
putting us in danger.

49:05.229 --> 49:07.030
I'm just trying
to keep us alive, okay?

49:07.064 --> 49:08.700
- I don't know what you're doing.
- We don't have time for this.

49:08.733 --> 49:12.135
I just had a gun put in my face.
How are you keeping us alive?

49:12.169 --> 49:14.304
You wouldn't last two seconds
in the real world.

49:14.338 --> 49:16.708
- No, I'd last longer than you.
- No the fuck you wouldn't.

49:16.741 --> 49:18.710
You're a fucking drug dealer.

49:18.743 --> 49:21.011
What the fuck?!

49:24.515 --> 49:26.618
You cannot run.

49:26.651 --> 49:28.285
Hey, I don't care what you do.

49:28.318 --> 49:30.755
You make bad choices,
you live with them, that's fine.

49:30.788 --> 49:34.124
But the kid deserves
his own chance.

49:34.157 --> 49:38.161
If you run, they will find you,
and they will kill him.

49:41.431 --> 49:42.600
So what are we supposed to do?

49:42.634 --> 49:44.535
You stay and you fight the war.

49:44.569 --> 49:47.137
Hamster, don't engage
with the troll.

49:47.170 --> 49:48.840
Fight the war?

49:48.873 --> 49:51.676
How are we supposed to do that?

49:51.709 --> 49:53.678
Don't undersell yourself.

49:53.711 --> 49:55.245
I'm here with you.

49:55.279 --> 49:57.615
I fell through a black hole
to get here,

49:57.649 --> 50:01.118
and I never knew why until now.

50:01.151 --> 50:03.555
It was so I can help you,

50:03.588 --> 50:05.088
both of you.

51:04.414 --> 51:07.384
When our folks died,

51:07.417 --> 51:12.557
I decided that all I want to do
is make my brother happy.

51:12.590 --> 51:14.659
And I got this money,

51:14.692 --> 51:18.528
and we were ready
to make the move and...

51:18.563 --> 51:20.732
We're still here because of you.

51:26.804 --> 51:29.741
I'm here to help you, Indigo.

51:29.774 --> 51:32.810
I'm going to kill them all.

51:32.844 --> 51:37.381
I'm going to annihilate
every last one of them.

51:37.414 --> 51:40.217
So that you and your brother
can be free.

51:43.621 --> 51:46.289
The Manager was never
going to let me go.

52:28.465 --> 52:31.201
You look insane.

52:38.876 --> 52:41.211
This cape, this suit.

52:44.015 --> 52:49.386
It's all I have left
of another world.

52:54.859 --> 52:56.594
You're what's left.

52:56.627 --> 52:58.730
Everything else is bullshit.

52:58.763 --> 53:00.297
Fuck the past.

53:00.330 --> 53:03.000
- Fuck the past.
- You got this.

53:03.034 --> 53:05.469
Let it burn.

53:05.502 --> 53:07.337
Let it burn.

53:15.780 --> 53:18.750
We'll clean up this city.

53:18.783 --> 53:20.952
We'll start over.

53:33.865 --> 53:36.500
Holy shit.

53:36.533 --> 53:39.336
You're a monster.

53:39.369 --> 53:41.572
We can finish this.

53:41.606 --> 53:43.641
Are you ready?

53:43.674 --> 53:47.779
Yeah.

53:47.812 --> 53:50.514
"H" for Hamster.

53:50.547 --> 53:51.849
Yeah, it's beautiful, Max.

53:51.883 --> 53:54.384
- Super modified.
- Oh, shit.

53:54.417 --> 53:57.789
You catch somebody with that,
it's pretty severe.

53:57.989 --> 54:01.525
Oh.

54:01.559 --> 54:02.960
You push that button,

54:02.994 --> 54:06.396
and then you'll always know
where you are.

54:06.429 --> 54:08.800
Thanks, Max.

54:08.833 --> 54:11.501
Dude, how did you make this?

54:11.535 --> 54:14.038
This is like a real weapon.

54:18.709 --> 54:20.544
Wait, are you serious?

54:20.578 --> 54:21.612
What, do you think it's easy

54:21.646 --> 54:23.080
punching your way
through gunfire?

54:23.114 --> 54:25.448
Dude, you cannot let Indigo
see you do that, Max.

54:25.482 --> 54:28.385
There's a fragment of the cosmic
blood in this.

54:28.418 --> 54:31.521
It's a synthetic analog,
but... but... but a scent.

54:31.556 --> 54:35.059
A memory.
A molecule.

54:36.928 --> 54:39.831
Oh, fuck.

54:39.864 --> 54:41.732
Oh. Oh, fuck.

54:41.766 --> 54:43.366
I was given power,

54:43.400 --> 54:45.703
power to experience,
the universe for everyone,

54:45.736 --> 54:48.505
all of the timelines,
all at once.

54:48.538 --> 54:50.775
Oh, coursing through my mind

54:50.808 --> 54:52.677
so that I could save them all.

54:52.710 --> 54:53.911
Are you saying that
the cosmic blood

54:53.945 --> 54:55.112
is fucking methamphetamine?

54:55.146 --> 54:57.048
Maybe I haven't tried
hard enough.

54:57.849 --> 55:00.017
The cosmic blood...

55:00.051 --> 55:03.087
- it allows me to ripple through.
- What?

55:03.120 --> 55:05.488
Ripple through the molecules,
do you understand me?

55:05.522 --> 55:06.724
Max.

55:06.757 --> 55:08.626
Lets me ripple
through the molecules.

55:08.659 --> 55:10.527
Max.

55:10.561 --> 55:12.529
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

55:16.601 --> 55:18.102
Stop it.

55:18.135 --> 55:21.606
Max. Max, don't.

55:23.174 --> 55:24.507
Max, no!

55:25.943 --> 55:29.180
Stop, stop. That's enough.

55:29.213 --> 55:31.481
Look. Look.

55:34.719 --> 55:36.053
You can see between the worlds.

55:36.087 --> 55:38.055
It's just another room.

56:28.906 --> 56:31.575
Absolutely. Of course.

56:32.977 --> 56:34.912
Boss is coming.

56:34.946 --> 56:37.447
Like, imminent.

56:42.753 --> 56:44.021
Fuck.

58:41.138 --> 58:44.341
Wait, wait, wait.

58:44.375 --> 58:46.710
Come on, man, get out of here.

58:57.388 --> 58:59.290
Go! Go!

59:12.770 --> 59:16.040
Hey, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

59:16.240 --> 59:18.843
Go, go, go, go, go.

59:54.078 --> 59:57.214
This is fucked up.

1:00:03.254 --> 1:00:05.222
What have we done?

1:00:59.143 --> 1:01:02.947
The field has changed.

1:01:02.980 --> 1:01:05.216
We need a new strategy.

1:01:06.217 --> 1:01:09.420
Max, you've got to stop
killing people.

1:01:09.453 --> 1:01:12.389
Indigo, I need to know
about The Manager's boss.

1:01:12.423 --> 1:01:14.058
- That's the key.
- It's the key to what?

1:01:14.091 --> 1:01:15.492
She's going to kill you.

1:01:15.526 --> 1:01:18.362
Who is, Max?
Who's going to kill me?

1:01:18.395 --> 1:01:22.933
When The Manager escaped,
it was with Cleo.

1:01:22.967 --> 1:01:25.936
She must have fallen ahead of me
through the vortex.

1:01:25.970 --> 1:01:28.272
This whole time, she's been here
running everything.

1:01:28.305 --> 1:01:30.774
Man, that's just
crazy talk, man!

1:01:34.144 --> 1:01:36.413
There's no crystal cave.

1:01:36.447 --> 1:01:38.849
There's no blue cosmic blood.

1:01:38.882 --> 1:01:41.785
You just put us all in danger
because you think

1:01:41.819 --> 1:01:44.321
your archenemy, Cleo,
is runnin' shit.

1:01:44.355 --> 1:01:47.291
She's here. She's here.
She's real!

1:01:47.324 --> 1:01:51.228
Don't you get it?
Everything I said is true.

1:01:55.299 --> 1:01:57.868
I can't do this
with you anymore, man.

1:02:01.171 --> 1:02:03.307
I just can't.

1:02:07.411 --> 1:02:10.447
Come on. I'll get us a car.
We're leaving tonight.

1:02:10.481 --> 1:02:14.285
Hamster, it doesn't matter
what you believe.

1:02:14.318 --> 1:02:17.555
You're going to be safe.

1:02:24.161 --> 1:02:29.300
Hallucinations, delusions.

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:31.302
Hearing voices.

1:02:31.335 --> 1:02:34.872
Isn't that what
you're telling me?

1:02:42.079 --> 1:02:44.815
No more fails!

1:02:50.521 --> 1:02:52.389
Just stop, Max.

1:02:52.423 --> 1:02:58.862
Just stop, just stop, just stop.

1:03:00.331 --> 1:03:03.167
He destroyed all of them.

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:06.437
Just like you destroyed us.

1:03:09.039 --> 1:03:11.942
Come to me.

1:03:17.247 --> 1:03:21.452
Just come to me, Max.

1:03:31.195 --> 1:03:34.264
Max Fist.

1:03:34.298 --> 1:03:37.534
Broken hero.

1:03:38.102 --> 1:03:41.271
A man alone.

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:46.644
A dream that never ends.

1:03:48.345 --> 1:03:52.116
Goodbye, Max Fist.

1:03:52.149 --> 1:03:57.521
Hamster City is closing down.

1:04:30.722 --> 1:04:33.725
I got to sleep for, like,
an hour, Hamst.

1:04:33.758 --> 1:04:35.560
I'm exhausted.

1:04:35.593 --> 1:04:38.462
I feel you.

1:04:48.606 --> 1:04:49.506
Melissa?

1:04:49.540 --> 1:04:52.376
<i>Oh, good.
I got you.</i>

1:04:52.409 --> 1:04:54.144
<i>You've been tough to
track down.</i>

1:04:54.178 --> 1:04:57.247
Wait, it... it's kind of a
fucked up time for me right now.

1:04:57.281 --> 1:04:58.650
I can't really talk.

1:04:58.683 --> 1:05:01.251
<i>I know
you're in trouble of some kind.</i>

1:05:01.285 --> 1:05:02.486
You do?

1:05:02.519 --> 1:05:04.521
<i>My boss, she wants to help you.</i>

1:05:04.556 --> 1:05:06.156
<i>She's setting up
a brand-new office.</i>

1:05:06.190 --> 1:05:08.158
<i>She's very powerful,
and she loves your work.</i>

1:05:08.192 --> 1:05:10.327
Let me just wake up my sister.

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:11.663
<i>Let your sister sleep.</i>

1:05:11.696 --> 1:05:15.999
<i>By the time she wakes up,
this will all be settled.</i>

1:05:16.033 --> 1:05:19.470
<i>Just relax.
I'm gonna pick you up.</i>

1:05:19.503 --> 1:05:24.508
- How do you...
- <i>See? Here I am.</i>

1:05:27.444 --> 1:05:30.013
Get in.

1:05:30.047 --> 1:05:31.749
Come on.

1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:05.048
You know, while we're waiting,

1:06:05.082 --> 1:06:08.218
I thought I'd
pitch you on something.

1:06:08.786 --> 1:06:10.788
I think we make
a pretty great team.

1:06:10.822 --> 1:06:13.490
You know, I really appreciate
all your support.

1:06:13.524 --> 1:06:17.060
You're really bailing me out of
a pretty fucked situation here.

1:06:18.262 --> 1:06:19.664
And I've been making a lot
of money for you

1:06:19.697 --> 1:06:21.265
from the...
from the neighborhood.

1:06:21.298 --> 1:06:27.137
But I want to cover
the whole country, city to city.

1:06:27.170 --> 1:06:28.840
I want to go viral.

1:06:28.873 --> 1:06:32.677
- You want to go viral?
- Yeah, I want to go viral.

1:06:42.854 --> 1:06:47.692
You know, you already perform
an important service

1:06:47.725 --> 1:06:50.728
to social order,
to business owners

1:06:50.762 --> 1:06:56.066
who want to get through a day
without a riot erupting.

1:06:56.868 --> 1:07:00.838
If it weren't for you,
those people passed out

1:07:00.872 --> 1:07:04.474
in the shadows on Fentanyl
would be running around

1:07:04.508 --> 1:07:06.844
smashing windows,
burning down buildings,

1:07:06.878 --> 1:07:10.380
stealing babies,
whatever they do.

1:07:10.414 --> 1:07:13.417
You keep things quiet.

1:07:13.450 --> 1:07:16.520
But I built this organization.

1:07:16.553 --> 1:07:20.257
I penetrate
every level of society.

1:07:20.290 --> 1:07:22.125
I'm in the cells of it.

1:07:22.159 --> 1:07:25.329
You want to go viral,
I am the virus.

1:07:25.362 --> 1:07:28.231
And you're the carrier.

1:07:32.402 --> 1:07:36.540
Well, I don't see myself
that way.

1:07:36.574 --> 1:07:38.843
You see, I see myself

1:07:38.876 --> 1:07:41.478
sitting on a balcony
at my beach house in Malibu,

1:07:41.511 --> 1:07:44.448
calling out all the key moves
while I'm watching the waves

1:07:44.481 --> 1:07:47.652
roll by, and right beside me,
I see...

1:07:49.286 --> 1:07:51.756
Well, I see someone
very special,

1:07:51.789 --> 1:07:56.561
someone who can hang with
that kind of energy, you know?

1:08:04.201 --> 1:08:08.271
I wanted to be the greatest
scientist in the universe.

1:08:09.974 --> 1:08:13.645
I taught myself the fabric
of 11 dimensional space

1:08:13.678 --> 1:08:18.215
and how to manipulate it.

1:08:18.248 --> 1:08:21.218
I wanted to explore.

1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:26.924
But then I spent all my time
building weapons.

1:08:27.558 --> 1:08:29.861
And robots.

1:08:29.894 --> 1:08:32.496
And traps.

1:08:33.497 --> 1:08:39.904
All of my intimate knowledge
diverted to one man.

1:08:43.975 --> 1:08:49.179
So the answer to your "pitch"
is no.

1:09:17.608 --> 1:09:20.611
Go get the mouse.

1:09:23.748 --> 1:09:25.016
Hi, I'm Melissa.

1:09:25.049 --> 1:09:26.718
It's amazing to finally
meet you.

1:09:26.751 --> 1:09:29.620
I am so excited
to introduce you to Hamster.

1:09:29.654 --> 1:09:32.456
I just wanted to let you know,
you know, sometimes he can be

1:09:32.489 --> 1:09:33.758
a little bit moody.

1:09:33.791 --> 1:09:35.425
I mean, obviously he's a genius,

1:09:35.459 --> 1:09:37.729
but it might just take some time
for him to get into it.

1:09:37.762 --> 1:09:38.763
Do you know what I mean?

1:09:38.796 --> 1:09:40.031
I doubt it.

1:10:25.076 --> 1:10:27.979
Hamster!

1:10:49.432 --> 1:10:54.071
Max, you're in so much
pain, and so am I.

1:10:54.105 --> 1:10:57.374
But I'm going to set us free.

1:10:57.407 --> 1:10:58.676
With this.

1:10:58.709 --> 1:11:00.845
I call it "the void machine."

1:11:00.878 --> 1:11:03.815
- It's a weapon.
- You think everything's

1:11:03.848 --> 1:11:07.051
a weapon, but it's not.

1:11:07.084 --> 1:11:11.022
When it detonates, it will
disrupt the cosmic source.

1:11:11.055 --> 1:11:13.858
No more hyper-human powers,

1:11:13.891 --> 1:11:18.129
not for you, not for anyone.

1:11:18.162 --> 1:11:22.432
Back to humanity for all of us.

1:11:22.465 --> 1:11:24.467
Especially us.

1:11:55.032 --> 1:11:59.604
Used to be so hard
to keep track of you.

1:11:59.637 --> 1:12:02.874
Now it's a bit of
facial recognition software

1:12:02.907 --> 1:12:04.742
and a teenager with
an iPhone.

1:12:04.775 --> 1:12:05.977
Put down the gun, Max.

1:12:06.010 --> 1:12:08.411
- You okay, kid?
- I don't know.

1:12:08.445 --> 1:12:10.047
- You here to rescue me?
- This is adorable.

1:12:10.081 --> 1:12:12.683
It's like adoption day
at the fuckin' kitten farm.

1:12:12.717 --> 1:12:15.620
Toss the gun, Max,
or the kid dies.

1:12:15.653 --> 1:12:17.588
Don't do it, Max.

1:12:17.622 --> 1:12:19.891
Okay, okay.

1:12:28.531 --> 1:12:30.601
Are you happy to see me?

1:12:31.702 --> 1:12:33.938
Come on, Max.

1:12:33.971 --> 1:12:36.974
At least recognize
what this means.

1:12:37.241 --> 1:12:39.610
For the kid.

1:12:41.012 --> 1:12:43.781
Get on your fucking knees.

1:12:44.949 --> 1:12:48.019
Get on your goddamn knees,
Max Fist.

1:12:48.052 --> 1:12:50.855
You fucked up my entire city!

1:12:50.888 --> 1:12:52.522
You cost me millions of dollars.

1:12:52.556 --> 1:12:54.992
And for what, huh?

1:12:59.230 --> 1:13:01.599
I think this has
gone on long enough.

1:13:01.632 --> 1:13:05.569
You need to deal
with your employee.

1:13:05.603 --> 1:13:06.871
My what?

1:13:06.904 --> 1:13:10.107
The sister.
She's downstairs. Go get her.

1:13:11.976 --> 1:13:15.046
Now, please.

1:13:26.724 --> 1:13:29.961
I've been here for so long.

1:13:29.994 --> 1:13:35.700
Building an empire,
getting ready for you

1:13:35.733 --> 1:13:38.035
to come back into my life.

1:13:42.039 --> 1:13:44.507
Look at you.

1:13:44.541 --> 1:13:47.611
On your knees.

1:13:47.645 --> 1:13:50.547
Max, get up.

1:13:50.581 --> 1:13:51.849
Get up, man.

1:13:51.882 --> 1:13:55.586
It's everything I always knew.

1:13:55.619 --> 1:13:59.590
Without the cosmic blood,
you're just...

1:13:59.623 --> 1:14:00.958
another worm.

1:14:00.992 --> 1:14:05.062
So in a way,
the void machine worked.

1:14:05.096 --> 1:14:07.530
Let the kid go.

1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:12.770
I didn't think
that you'd make a friend.

1:14:12.803 --> 1:14:15.673
You seem to care about him.

1:14:15.706 --> 1:14:19.643
You do know that he's a lying,
psychotic animal, right?

1:14:19.677 --> 1:14:21.245
You don't know
anything about him.

1:14:21.278 --> 1:14:27.084
I have a private army of
200 people with assault rifles.

1:14:27.118 --> 1:14:31.655
And he gave you this
to defend yourself.

1:14:32.089 --> 1:14:35.259
He must not care
about you after all.

1:14:59.784 --> 1:15:03.120
God damn it, Indigo.
I had plans for you.

1:15:23.774 --> 1:15:26.243
What did he tell you about me?

1:15:28.979 --> 1:15:31.115
You want to tell him the truth?

1:15:32.216 --> 1:15:36.220
I don't know the truth.

1:15:36.253 --> 1:15:39.990
Well, then, let's...
let's try and walk through it.

1:15:43.194 --> 1:15:46.997
Was that your wife?

1:15:48.265 --> 1:15:50.601
Yes.

1:15:54.872 --> 1:15:57.141
Were you the hero of Chromium?

1:15:59.910 --> 1:16:00.911
Yes.

1:16:00.945 --> 1:16:02.713
A hero that nobody wanted?

1:16:02.746 --> 1:16:07.318
A hero whose rage and violence
destroyed an entire city?

1:16:11.288 --> 1:16:14.291
He doesn't want to answer that,
but the answer's yes.

1:16:29.907 --> 1:16:35.012
♪ Get down, get down,
little Henry Lee ♪

1:16:35.045 --> 1:16:39.416
♪ And spare a kiss or two ♪

1:16:39.450 --> 1:16:43.754
♪ With a little pen knife
held in her hand ♪

1:16:45.422 --> 1:16:49.894
♪ She plugged him
through and through ♪

1:16:49.927 --> 1:16:52.062
You remember this?

1:16:54.498 --> 1:16:57.434
He did this to me.

1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:13.083
I have this theory.

1:17:13.117 --> 1:17:19.390
Something that would happen
when you and I are in proximity,

1:17:19.423 --> 1:17:23.894
a sort of physical reaction.

1:17:23.928 --> 1:17:28.065
And since I'm a scientist,
I need to see for myself.

1:17:28.098 --> 1:17:30.367
Aah!

1:17:40.811 --> 1:17:41.912
Oh, fuck.

1:17:45.916 --> 1:17:47.117
Aah!

1:17:49.954 --> 1:17:52.089
Where's my brother?

1:18:03.801 --> 1:18:05.269
It's true.

1:18:05.302 --> 1:18:07.371
I'll be damned.

1:18:10.274 --> 1:18:13.377
This is so strange, isn't it?

1:18:13.410 --> 1:18:16.513
You and I are from
another place.

1:18:16.547 --> 1:18:21.151
We're aliens.

1:18:23.153 --> 1:18:25.189
Maybe our biology
wants to connect.

1:18:25.222 --> 1:18:27.758
Maybe it wants to intersect.

1:18:29.426 --> 1:18:32.896
'Cause you and I were always
so special together.

1:18:40.371 --> 1:18:44.375
That's my guess anyways.

1:18:54.318 --> 1:18:56.920
He was here six years
before you.

1:18:56.954 --> 1:18:58.889
And I built an empire.

1:18:58.922 --> 1:19:02.993
And all that time I was thinking
that I was wasting my time

1:19:03.027 --> 1:19:08.098
worrying about how I could
hurt you as badly as possible.

1:19:15.005 --> 1:19:19.843
I couldn't take away your
powers there, but here...

1:19:28.152 --> 1:19:31.188
Fuckin' bitch, what I said!

1:19:31.221 --> 1:19:32.489
Aaah!

1:19:32.523 --> 1:19:34.992
I've got you, Max Fist.

1:19:38.495 --> 1:19:41.532
I never wanted to do this shit!

1:19:41.566 --> 1:19:43.867
I never wanted to be like you!

1:19:43.901 --> 1:19:45.936
You lose.

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.988
I got you.

1:20:40.991 --> 1:20:43.661
Even without powers.

1:20:48.566 --> 1:20:53.437
All I want is to see you bleed.

1:22:07.511 --> 1:22:10.682
What's that? What's that?

1:22:28.131 --> 1:22:29.767
Indi!

1:22:45.215 --> 1:22:48.452
Look at you!

1:22:50.287 --> 1:22:55.225
You're going to be okay.

1:22:58.228 --> 1:23:00.130
I met a guy
who I'd like to say

1:23:00.163 --> 1:23:03.133
was from another planet.

1:23:06.403 --> 1:23:09.741
He thought this city was a trap.

1:23:09.774 --> 1:23:12.644
He thought it was the end.

1:23:14.646 --> 1:23:17.782
You know, you never really know
why it chooses you.

1:23:18.482 --> 1:23:20.652
It just does.

1:23:21.819 --> 1:23:24.187
This is Hamster City,
motherfucker.

1:23:25.489 --> 1:23:30.394
And now it has new heroes
to protect it.

1:23:30.427 --> 1:23:32.564
You feel me?

1:23:32.597 --> 1:23:35.165
Yeah, I know you do.

1:23:35.198 --> 1:23:37.100
Splash!
