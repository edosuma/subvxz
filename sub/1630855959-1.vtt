now, you know?

the striking European duo,

01:18.279 --> 01:20.581

Milli Vanilli were there...

01:41.169 --> 01:44.872
- Everybody participated,
but they were the scapegoats.

01:44.972 --> 01:48.442
- Record companies are oddly
silent on the whole issue.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.811

01:50.911 --> 01:53.847
the machine that is
underneath a pop act.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.950
- We want to say thank you
to our producer.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.852
- The evil genius,
I guess we could call him.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.355
- If it wasn't for him,
this would not even take place.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.756

How do you handle that?

02:24.412 --> 02:26.614
- It cost them everything.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.149
- There is not another story
like this

in pop music history.

02:30.918 --> 02:37.891

03:34.848 --> 03:36.884
Oh!

Yeah, man, we were
young and fresh, man.

That's a normal tank top but
I think he just pulled on it.

You know, I mean,
we were fashion forward.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.604
That was a big show in Germany.

Yeah, that was a cool vibe.

Hmm.

You know, Rob Pilatus doesn't
look right in this photo.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.519
I can see the decline.

04:11.619 --> 04:15.222
'Cause that's not
what Rob looked like

04:15.323 --> 04:17.725
or was supposed to look like.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.661
He was extremely strong,

life took a toll on him.

When I turned 18,
I went to Munich, Germany,

04:52.626 --> 04:54.595
ran out of money,

04:54.695 --> 04:59.933
ended up being homeless for
a couple weeks.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.837
It was cold so I had to
sleep in the train station,

05:03.937 --> 05:06.474
but I was able to
get some jobs

05:06.574 --> 05:09.343
teaching classes
with dance school,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.679
'cause that was my background
in Paris.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.750
And then one day,
I went to a party in Munich

05:16.850 --> 05:19.319
and there he was,
Mr. Rob Pilatus.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.188
[hip-hop music]

05:21.288 --> 05:22.723

doing the helicopter.

At the end,

05:30.431 --> 05:32.400
when everybody gave him
his props and everything,

05:32.500 --> 05:34.067
he saw me and he was like,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.737
"Who the hell are you?
That's my turf!"

05:36.837 --> 05:38.338

many Black people

05:38.439 --> 05:39.673

[soft hip-hop music]

dark-skinned people.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.014
There were none.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.983
Rob was older than me
by two years.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.485
He had an infectious laugh--

05:51.585 --> 05:52.820
[imitating laugh]

05:52.920 --> 05:55.489
Like, really loud, you know?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.990
I was socially awkward.

05:57.090 --> 06:01.061
You know, I was shy and
I was not fluent in German.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.631
It was like big brother,
little brother.

*

06:05.666 --> 06:08.268
He became my best friend.

But I felt like there was
something inside of him

06:10.938 --> 06:13.474
that was--that was missing.

07:16.604 --> 07:20.040
- Every time we talked about
that period of his life,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.676
it was kind of like taboo,

07:22.776 --> 07:26.446
but I understood his pain.

07:26.547 --> 07:30.083
Growing up, my family
was so dysfunctional.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.721
It was an abusive environment,

07:33.821 --> 07:37.457
and I ran away.

he was looking for a family.

[soft determined music]

We moved in together in
an attic of a friend of his.

Rob would take the bed,
I would take the sofa.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.476
But there was, like,
a stereo system,

We both liked dancing,

parties together.

and I would pop, lock,

08:30.711 --> 08:33.213

a lot of attention.

08:33.313 --> 08:38.185
So we started doing shows
in this club, Piantz.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.654
We loved to entertain
people, like,

08:40.754 --> 08:43.323

that roar,

08:46.159 --> 08:48.862

08:48.962 --> 08:50.898

what we did in the club,

08:50.998 --> 08:54.267
sing, perform, live the life,

08:54.367 --> 08:58.405

We ended up modeling as well.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.592

We were making a lot of noise
in Munich at that time,

we get to the next level?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.366
[upbeat curious music]

09:26.466 --> 09:30.037
In order to become pop stars,
we had to have the look,

09:30.137 --> 09:34.041
so we had to study
what makes a superstar.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.777

the hair.

We were like,
"Hell yeah, we're doing this."

09:49.923 --> 09:50.991
And the hair came...

09:51.091 --> 09:54.027
[snaps]
Like that.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.864
Hoo!
The reactions were amazing.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.431
Every time we went to
the clubs,

09:58.531 --> 10:01.468

loved the clothing--

"Oh, my God!

I was like,
"Oh, wow, that's--that's big"

was a huge group.

you're like,

12:09.897 --> 12:11.999
"Wow, that dude is awesome."

12:12.099 --> 12:14.067
- It was on the radio,
at parties.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.336
- Boney M. made music that
you could dance to

12:16.436 --> 12:19.472
and get drunk to and have fun.

get together to form Boney M.?

12:23.343 --> 12:27.815
- Well, it all came about from
our producer Frank Farian.

We realized that this could be
the one we've been waiting for,

compound was huge.

12:52.873 --> 12:57.010
we were greeted by all those
gold records on the wall,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.312
and it was amazing.

the recording contract,

13:29.176 --> 13:31.979
and we never really
attempted to read it.

13:32.079 --> 13:36.716
We were not trying to say no
to this powerful producer.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.787
Also, we would get, like,
1,500 deutschmark each,

13:40.888 --> 13:45.025
and we were like,
"Oh, hell yeah. Where? OK."

13:45.125 --> 13:48.061
[suspicious music]

13:48.161 --> 13:51.164
When we signed that contract,

13:51.264 --> 13:52.665
we toasted.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.968
*

13:55.068 --> 13:56.836
We were, like, breaking bread.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.872
*

13:58.972 --> 14:02.910
But then Frank leaned over
to Rob and told him,

14:03.010 --> 14:05.845
"Don't fuck with me.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.780
Don't ever fuck with me."

14:07.881 --> 14:10.717
[soft curious music]

14:10.817 --> 14:15.122
*

14:15.222 --> 14:19.559
Several months went by.

14:19.659 --> 14:24.197
They never gave us
any information.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.532
That was driving us crazy.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.467
Like, why don't
they tell us, like,

14:27.567 --> 14:30.938
a date where we can come
to do the vocals,

14:31.038 --> 14:33.974
or like, when do
we get started?

14:34.074 --> 14:37.010
*

14:37.110 --> 14:39.612
Finally, Ingrid called.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.349
"Come to studio.
It's gonna be good."

14:42.449 --> 14:45.352
Oh, man, we were pumped.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.821
We went straight to
the studio.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.858
And then once everyone is
in the room,

14:51.959 --> 14:53.860
he plays a tune.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.063
[machine clicks]

14:56.163 --> 14:58.966
["Girl You Know It's True"
playing]

14:59.066 --> 15:04.237
*

15:04.337 --> 15:08.641
I couldn't believe that
this music was for us.

15:08.741 --> 15:14.081
*

15:14.181 --> 15:15.282
I saw colors.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.151
I saw us onstage

15:18.251 --> 15:20.753
singing in front of a crowd.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.489
And then when
the music stopped...

15:22.589 --> 15:25.192
[music stops]
It was like, wow.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.327
You could still
hear those bells--

15:27.427 --> 15:29.896
ding, ding, ding, ding.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.368
He turned, and then,

15:35.468 --> 15:38.338
you know, "folgen Sie mir."
You know, "follow me."

15:38.438 --> 15:40.807
[soft tense music]

15:40.907 --> 15:42.009
- [speaking German]

15:42.109 --> 15:43.210
- It felt serious.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.512
*

15:45.612 --> 15:48.648
And then we end up
in this dark room.

15:48.748 --> 15:52.319
Rob and Frank start talking
really fast in German,

15:52.419 --> 15:54.787
so I can't really understand
everything,

15:54.887 --> 15:57.457
but I can tell, like,
it's getting intense.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.993
Like, they raise their voices.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.362
Rob is looking at me with
his green eyes.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.930
Like, he looks pissed.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.598
*

16:05.698 --> 16:08.835
Frank leaves and screams,

16:08.935 --> 16:11.604
and then Rob turns to me,
saying,

16:11.704 --> 16:14.307
"They don't want us to sing
on this record."

16:14.407 --> 16:16.309
And I'm like, like--

16:16.409 --> 16:18.245
So, I'm trying to speak.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.379
I'm trying to talk to him

16:19.479 --> 16:20.747
and trying to get
as much information,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.582
but he was like,
"Just wait, wait.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.784
"They don't want us to sing!

16:24.884 --> 16:27.120
They want us to
lip-sync the song."

16:27.220 --> 16:28.588
I'm like, "What?"

16:28.688 --> 16:31.558
Why in the hell?
Like, he's playing us a song.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.227
I'm trying to understand,
like, what do you mean?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.795
I don't get it.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.930
And that's where I--I--
I black out.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.533
[music fades out]

16:40.633 --> 16:42.935
[soft suspicious music]

16:43.036 --> 16:45.138
I remember thinking,
"This is weird.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.740
Like, we don't want to
lip-sync."

16:47.840 --> 16:52.445
That's when Ingrid
gave us the options.

16:54.047 --> 16:58.485
What she conveyed to us
clearly is that

16:58.585 --> 17:02.522
we signed the contract,
we got money--

17:02.622 --> 17:05.892
if we didn't want to
take part,

17:05.992 --> 17:08.261
we have to pay them back.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.929
But Ingrid said,

17:10.029 --> 17:13.032
"It's not just the advance
that we paid you,

17:13.133 --> 17:15.034
"but also all the money that
we gave you

17:15.135 --> 17:17.404
through the months."

17:17.504 --> 17:19.972
We developed a debt
towards Frank Farian.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.309
*

17:22.409 --> 17:24.877
We were scared as hell.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.381
I was 21 years old
and Rob was 24.

17:28.481 --> 17:32.051
*

17:32.152 --> 17:34.587
We had nowhere to go.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.524
So we thought,
OK, it's one song.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.826
You do that and you're out.

17:39.926 --> 17:44.697
[water rushing]

17:44.797 --> 17:47.800
[Boney M's "Sunny" playing]

17:47.900 --> 17:54.874
*

17:56.576 --> 17:59.546
- * Sunny

17:59.646 --> 18:04.384
* Yesterday, my life was
filled with rain *

18:04.484 --> 18:07.053
* Sunny

18:07.154 --> 18:12.125
* You smiled at me and
really eased the pain *

18:12.225 --> 18:13.426
* Sunny

18:13.526 --> 18:20.467
*

18:22.535 --> 18:25.372
- Hold on.
[chuckles]

18:25.472 --> 18:28.775
I should not be so funny.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.043
Serious.

18:31.144 --> 18:34.080
[laughs]

18:34.181 --> 18:36.115
This is serious.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.718
Thank you, schatzi.
[kisses]

18:39.919 --> 18:41.321
- Interview, "Milli."
Take one.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.523
Camera A and B, mark.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.159
- I've heard that
the name Milli Vanilli

18:46.259 --> 18:47.727
is because of you.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.229
- Oh.
- Is that true?

18:49.329 --> 18:50.497
- That's true.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.665
[soft music]

18:52.765 --> 18:54.867
I was Frank's girlfriend.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.983
I wrote the checks because
I was the financial controller

19:11.083 --> 19:13.553
of Frank's company.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.693
When they came into
the studio,

19:20.793 --> 19:22.995
they looked fantastic.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.132
I never saw people like that
so well-dressed

19:26.233 --> 19:27.834
and good-looking and braids,

19:27.934 --> 19:30.503
and Rob's eyes, green--
[gasps]

19:30.603 --> 19:32.305
You couldn't stop
looking at him.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.541
*

19:47.487 --> 19:50.757
But they were
such good dancers.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.770
- Frank needed American singer
like me.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.305
He said,
"I'm gonna make a project

20:05.405 --> 20:07.274
and you'll be the lead singer."

20:07.374 --> 20:08.908
I said, "OK, let's do it."

20:14.314 --> 20:16.383
- I'm from Houston, Texas.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.251
Frank says,
"I have a new project.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.486
Can you rap it?"

20:19.586 --> 20:22.389
He wrote me a check
for $12,000.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.257
Just keep your mouth shut.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.627
- Frank said, "Linda, we're
gonna need backing vocalists."

20:27.727 --> 20:29.262
So I brought in
my twin sister Jodie.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.063
- And I looked at her, I said,
"If this is 'oohs' and 'ahs'

20:31.163 --> 20:33.300
and 'I love you,'
I'm gonna shoot you."

20:33.400 --> 20:34.567
- I said, "Shut up."

20:34.667 --> 20:36.336
He hits it, he says,
"I want you to sing this."

20:36.436 --> 20:37.937
both: * Ooh, ooh, ooh

20:38.037 --> 20:39.105
- * I love you
- I said, "Don't say it!"

20:39.205 --> 20:40.807
[suspicious music]

20:48.247 --> 20:52.319
The song is ready,
and the two guys--perfect.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.555
*

20:55.655 --> 20:57.590
- When they're told
they're gonna lip-sync,

20:57.690 --> 20:59.191
what's their reaction?

20:59.292 --> 21:00.660
- No problem at all.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.631
They agreed and said,
"OK, when can we start?"

21:04.731 --> 21:07.300
It was never an--an--
an argument.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.736
Never ever. Never!

21:09.836 --> 21:13.039
- So you didn't have to
convince them to lip-sync?

21:13.139 --> 21:14.641
- No! Why?

21:14.741 --> 21:17.310
[soft dark music]

21:17.410 --> 21:19.078
They want to have success
and...

21:27.620 --> 21:30.623
- Was there ever
a point you said,

21:30.723 --> 21:33.159
give us the advance back
that we gave you.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.461
- [sigh] Gosh.
No.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.662
- No?
- No.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.697
- You didn't ask--
- No, no, no.

21:37.797 --> 21:42.268
This is not Frank's art--
artwork, yeah.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.904
If they would refuse,
they can go back to Munich

21:45.004 --> 21:46.639
and can...
[flaps lips]

21:46.739 --> 21:48.307
go for...

21:49.409 --> 21:51.043
or something like that.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.645
[chuckles softly]

21:52.745 --> 21:57.750
*

21:57.850 --> 21:59.986
- Well, I, uh...
[clears throat]

22:00.086 --> 22:05.658
The first time I went to share
my side, uh,

22:05.758 --> 22:06.993
I was young.

22:07.093 --> 22:10.262
And if you're a young artist,

22:10.363 --> 22:14.834
you can only tell what
they want you to tell.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.537
But now, fuck it.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.071
[laughs]

22:19.171 --> 22:22.141
I ain't keeping
my mouth shut for nobody.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.876
*

22:23.976 --> 22:28.615
Frank Farian, he was just a--

22:28.715 --> 22:34.220
a genius of his art
of making money.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.924
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.493
You know,
it's not the first time.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.095
The same game was played with
Boney M.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.566
*

22:46.666 --> 22:50.537
Bobby was not a singer.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.704
He was a dancer.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.607
*

22:54.707 --> 22:56.308
He was a dancer.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.084
- And who sung?

23:05.184 --> 23:05.918
Frank.

23:06.018 --> 23:11.491
- [distorted vocals]

23:11.591 --> 23:14.126
- And it sold

23:14.226 --> 23:16.028
how many platinums,
how many golds,

23:16.128 --> 23:17.396
you know what I'm saying?

23:25.472 --> 23:28.975
- You're looking at him as
a producer

23:29.075 --> 23:32.812
that made most his money
on Black artists,

23:32.912 --> 23:34.847
and it worked.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.649
Then years later, he came back

23:36.749 --> 23:39.786
and did it again
with Milli Vanilli.

23:39.886 --> 23:43.222
*

23:43.322 --> 23:45.525
He took my voice,

23:45.625 --> 23:49.696
he took their faces,

23:49.796 --> 23:52.965
he put the project together,

23:53.065 --> 23:56.368
he put it on the market,

23:56.469 --> 23:58.638
and he got rich off it.

23:58.738 --> 24:03.009
*

24:03.109 --> 24:06.045
- Milli Vanilli was delivered
by Frank Farian,

24:06.145 --> 24:08.915
and we were the distributor.

24:09.015 --> 24:13.853
We only saw the pictures of
the both guys and the song.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.323
Was nice-looking guys.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.259
Internationally, they could be
sold because they were colored

24:20.359 --> 24:22.795
and everything was--every--
it fits together.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.964
The product was great.
The music was great.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.567
The whole project is fantastic.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.805
- No, we didn't know it.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.741
I got tapes where--

24:34.841 --> 24:40.479
me, I was told that
it's Rob and Fab singing.

24:40.580 --> 24:45.752
- [speaking German]

24:45.852 --> 24:47.186
- One day,
we're at a friend's house

24:47.286 --> 24:49.956
watching "Formel Eins,"
this TV show...

24:50.056 --> 24:52.191
- [speaking German]

24:52.291 --> 24:54.994
- And then we see
Milli Vanilli.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.030
- Milli Vanilli,
"Girl You Know It's True."

24:58.130 --> 25:01.601
- Our name on television
on "Formel Eins."

25:01.701 --> 25:03.603
We used to dance
behind the stars

25:03.703 --> 25:05.237
who would come on this show,

25:05.337 --> 25:08.641
and suddenly,
we're in the charts.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.242
I mean, we went crazy.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.613
Running, like,
we even broke stuff.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.382
The song starts to blow up,

25:16.482 --> 25:18.551
and it happens so fast.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.386
Like, every week,
it was going up.

25:20.486 --> 25:21.988
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom,

25:22.088 --> 25:25.024
boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, pow!

25:25.124 --> 25:26.693
- And the song just takes off.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.227
It becomes a huge hit
in Germany.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.901
- Nobody knew
it was gonna be a hit.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.669
Not even Frank.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.871
But once he's seen
it was rising,

25:38.971 --> 25:41.273
then he started putting
more promotion into it.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.209
- Suddenly,
we were in "Bravo,"

25:43.309 --> 25:47.479
a youth magazine in Germany,
selling millions every week.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.016
People that were not
taking us seriously

25:50.116 --> 25:52.985
were suddenly like, "Hey."

25:53.085 --> 25:55.387
And now it's going through
Europe.

25:55.487 --> 25:59.091
So we travel up and down Europe
on television.

26:00.426 --> 26:01.828
We were nervous.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.395
"Can you drop your mic
a little bit?"

26:03.495 --> 26:05.231
No, I'm gonna keep it there.
[laughs]

26:05.331 --> 26:07.033

26:07.133 --> 26:10.903
But nervousness translated
into excitement.

26:11.003 --> 26:15.608
*

26:15.708 --> 26:18.410
A minute ago,
we didn't want to do this,

26:18.510 --> 26:21.113
but now, we want more.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.915
We were so pumped.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.818
You're in Italy,
you're in Spain,

26:25.918 --> 26:27.419
you're in Holland.

26:27.519 --> 26:30.056
- And then all of a sudden,
it hits the States.

26:30.890 --> 26:31.924
Bam.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.293
[loud explosion]

26:34.393 --> 26:37.329
[rock music]

26:37.429 --> 26:39.565
- * I'm in love with you, girl,
'cause you're on my mind *

26:39.666 --> 26:42.101
* You're the one I think about
most every time *

26:42.201 --> 26:44.637
* And when you pack a smile
in everything you do *

26:44.737 --> 26:46.973
* Don't you understand, girl,
this love is true *

26:47.073 --> 26:50.576
- They came in,
braids swinging...

26:50.677 --> 26:52.611
- Chest bumping...

26:52.712 --> 26:54.380
with tights on.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.050
- It was two Black dudes
with dreads coming into pop.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.053
That alone was
the shock factor.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.657
- * Girl, you know it's true

27:04.757 --> 27:07.727
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

27:07.827 --> 27:10.797
- The hair and the bandannas
and the shoulder pads.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.498
- * Yes, you know it's true

27:12.598 --> 27:14.433
- It was a totally
different style.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.036
both:
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

27:17.136 --> 27:18.805
- That's all we knew.
- They had it all.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.506
Like, their visuals were
on point.

27:20.606 --> 27:22.641
- I mean, they were
just eye candy.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.244
It was yummy, yummy, yummy.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.414
[upbeat funk music]

27:28.514 --> 27:30.516
- "Girl You Know It's True"
becomes the number two hit

27:30.616 --> 27:31.684
in the United States.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.452
- "Girl You Know It's True,"
number two.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.988
Oh, my God.

27:36.088 --> 27:40.492
- It became a top five hit in
23 countries around the world.

27:40.592 --> 27:43.863
That's Michael Jackson
level success.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.464
- Ah!

27:45.564 --> 27:46.632
[energizing music]

27:46.733 --> 27:48.467
- Great music, it just rises.

27:48.567 --> 27:52.371
When those special ones come,
they come.

27:52.471 --> 27:55.607
- As much as it wasn't
the right thing to do,

27:55.708 --> 27:58.210
the power of
"Girl You Know It's True"...

27:58.310 --> 27:59.979
* I'm so in love, girl

28:00.079 --> 28:01.080
Was pulling on us.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.681
* I'm so in love, girl

28:02.782 --> 28:04.150
*

28:04.250 --> 28:08.387
This energy, this hype...
- Do you want to party?

28:08.487 --> 28:11.690
- The love...
[loud cheering]

28:11.791 --> 28:15.027
So from that point on,

28:15.127 --> 28:18.164
we embraced the lie.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.594
- What's up?
- Running.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.429
- Yeah.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.232
Number one.
[music playing]

28:53.332 --> 28:54.366
- Every time we were
around people

28:54.466 --> 28:55.835
or, like, taking pictures...

28:55.935 --> 28:57.236
- OK.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.506
- We knew,
you know, you know.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.374
They don't know.
Do they know? I don't know.

29:05.644 --> 29:08.747
- But it was too difficult to
say no to this new life.

29:08.848 --> 29:12.351
[music playing]

29:12.451 --> 29:16.522
"Girl You Know It's True"
just unveiled the beast in us.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.562
- Yeah.

29:24.864 --> 29:29.401
*

29:29.501 --> 29:31.737
- We came from nothing
and now we were tasting

29:31.838 --> 29:33.840
this pop star life.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.408
To be adored, to be loved,

29:36.508 --> 29:39.711
that became very addictive.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.103
- I was nervous.

30:04.203 --> 30:10.242
Being caught was something that
was always, always very aware.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.845
- So, when will we have
your LP?

30:12.945 --> 30:15.447
- Gonna come out in two weeks.

30:15.547 --> 30:20.319
It's just like very pop
dance orientated music.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.621
Are you ready here?
[cheers]

30:24.723 --> 30:28.527
- For us, it was a surprise
that it developed immediately.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.829
It was worthwhile thinking
about what you can do.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.000
Do we need an album?
Yes, we need an album.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.169
Do we need a second single?
Yes, we need a second single.

30:37.269 --> 30:43.075
[soft dark music]

30:43.175 --> 30:45.377
- I get the call.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.946
"Frank needs to talk to you."

30:48.447 --> 30:51.083
So I goes up to the studio,

30:51.183 --> 30:54.420
Ingrid opened the door,
I go in.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.654
Sit in the kitchen and wait.

30:55.754 --> 30:58.557
*

30:58.657 --> 31:03.095
He came out--took his time,
fixed him a coffee--

31:03.195 --> 31:05.564
and then he said,

31:05.664 --> 31:08.734
"I told you,
keep your mouth shut."

31:08.834 --> 31:11.971
*

31:12.071 --> 31:16.208
He says to me, um,
"They found out in Munich,

31:16.308 --> 31:18.744
"from your promotion manager
or whoever,

31:18.844 --> 31:21.713
"that you're the voice.

31:21.813 --> 31:23.815
Don't want to
see you here anymore."

31:23.916 --> 31:25.684
We didn't talk anymore.

31:25.784 --> 31:29.421
That's it.

31:29.521 --> 31:34.360
I was kicked to the curb.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.229
[mysterious music]

31:37.329 --> 31:39.932
- One night,
Frank Farian called me up.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.901
He said, "John, I've got
a project I'm working on."

31:44.803 --> 31:49.575
"I had a rapper, Charles Shaw,
who tried the situation

31:49.675 --> 31:53.712
and he was not good so
can you come to the studio?"

31:53.812 --> 31:56.048
*

31:56.148 --> 31:58.350
So that's what I did.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.719
He said,
"You got 10,000 D-marks,"

32:00.819 --> 32:02.788
and I said, "Wow."

32:02.888 --> 32:05.891
He said, "You're gonna do
the whole album with me."

32:05.992 --> 32:09.561
- Frank said, "We're gonna be
doing more songs."

32:09.661 --> 32:11.797
- We always asked,
"Where is Rob and Fab?

32:11.897 --> 32:13.865
When are they gonna
start singing?"

32:13.966 --> 32:16.202
Frank said, "They're gonna
record in the evening

32:16.302 --> 32:17.769
when you guys are done."

32:36.522 --> 32:39.158
- I used to have to go through
the back door

32:39.258 --> 32:41.227
because Frank didn't want
nobody know

32:41.327 --> 32:43.529
I was the lead singer.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.931
- This is run like
a tight military operation.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.500
It's on a need-to-know basis.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.936
It was smoke and mirrors.

32:51.037 --> 32:55.474
David Copperfield
couldn't have done it better.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.777
- We like it hot, don't we?
[cheers and applause]

32:58.877 --> 33:01.480
You want to get down with
Milli Vanilli?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.150
They're coming.
It's a hit. Shake your booty.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.785
"Girl You Know It's True."

[energetic music]

33:09.921 --> 33:17.029

33:17.629 --> 33:18.830
- One, mark.
- Mark.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.602
- Make sure everyone's phone's
on silent.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.104
- That's a good idea.

33:25.204 --> 33:30.776
*

33:30.876 --> 33:34.413
- Clive is a--
is a gift-seeker.

33:34.513 --> 33:38.350
He is like the Yoda of talent.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.985
He knows.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.354
He just knows.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.757
- With Milli Vanilli,
Clive saw dollar signs.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.926
"Girl You Know It's True"
is big now.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.929
How can we cash in on
the immediate moment?

33:51.029 --> 33:54.200
- Well, we moved everything up
as fast as possible.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.035
- Clive would say every week
that we're missing,

33:57.136 --> 33:59.338
we're missing, like,
a million dollars.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.574
So we had to put
an album in motion.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.844
But the album that's out
in Europe, "All or Nothing,"

34:05.944 --> 34:09.915
was not strong enough
to release in America.

34:10.015 --> 34:12.484
- Clive called up
Diane Warren.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.320
- Diane Warren is one of
the biggest songwriters

34:14.420 --> 34:15.587
there are in the country.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.756
- I had written
"Blame It On The Rain"

34:17.856 --> 34:19.325
when I was scheduled
to see Clive,

34:19.425 --> 34:21.693
and he goes, I want you to
hear this new group I have.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.262
And he played me
"Girl You Know It's True."

34:23.362 --> 34:24.563
I'm like, "This is so crazy

34:24.663 --> 34:25.864
"'cause the song
I'm bringing you

34:25.964 --> 34:27.366
really sounds like
the follow-up to that."

34:27.466 --> 34:28.767
It's even the same rhythm.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.270
"Girl You Know It's True,"
"Blame It On The Rain."

34:31.370 --> 34:33.038
I played him the song
and he loved it.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.874
He sent it to Frank Farian
and they recorded it.

34:35.974 --> 34:38.510
*

34:38.610 --> 34:41.547
- Normally,
when you've given the producer

34:41.647 --> 34:44.383
some repertoire
for them to record,

34:44.483 --> 34:47.453
you want to be there
to make sure it gets done.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.521
In the case of Frank, though,

34:49.621 --> 34:52.291
he didn't want anyone
in the studio.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.093
[mysterious music]

34:55.194 --> 34:59.431
- It was very weird for us
to find the songs,

34:59.531 --> 35:01.032
send them to Frank,

35:01.133 --> 35:06.705
and then have them produce it
without any of our presence.

35:06.805 --> 35:11.143
But the speculation that
we were somehow aware of

35:11.243 --> 35:14.246
what was going on
behind the scenes in Germany

35:14.346 --> 35:17.749
is simply not the case.

35:17.849 --> 35:22.621
If an outside producer sends
in all the album credits,

35:22.721 --> 35:24.223
you have to take it on faith

35:24.323 --> 35:27.759
that represents what actually
happened in the studio.

35:27.859 --> 35:30.061
There was no reason
to think not.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.802
- Ah, there it is.

35:36.902 --> 35:40.038
So this is the European version
of the album "All or Nothing."

35:40.138 --> 35:43.275
You see Rob and Fab on
the cover, the first album.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.611
That's their, like,
running man logo.

35:45.711 --> 35:46.745
There they are on the back,

35:46.845 --> 35:49.681
shirtless, of course,
'cause why not?

35:49.781 --> 35:54.586
And let's see
who's credited on this album.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.592
So it says musicians here,

36:00.692 --> 36:04.763
and I don't see Rob and Fab
on here at all.

36:04.863 --> 36:10.369
So, backing vocals, Jodie and
Linda Rocco, Charles Shaw--

36:10.469 --> 36:11.903
produced by Frank Farian.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.341
But this is the truth
in advertising version

36:15.441 --> 36:17.075
that doesn't have them on it.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.346
If I'm at a record label and
I'm putting out this record,

36:20.446 --> 36:23.749
and I look at the vocalists and
the guys who are on the cover

36:23.849 --> 36:26.485
are not listed in
the liner notes,

36:26.585 --> 36:27.919
I'm gonna have some questions,
you know?

36:28.019 --> 36:31.189
Like, that is a giant
red flag for me.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.297
- That was the name of
the European album.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.769
- Really?
OK. I didn't know that.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.972
- So that's--
- [chuckles]

36:53.011 --> 36:54.212
- [laughs] I--

36:54.313 --> 36:55.213
I don't know what to say
to that.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.652
- Yeah, but we didn't
release that record, so--

37:05.424 --> 37:07.893
- Really? I forgot about that.

37:07.993 --> 37:11.029
["Blame It On The Rain"

37:22.408 --> 37:24.710
* Blame it on the stars

37:24.810 --> 37:26.244
- * Stars
- * Ooh

37:26.345 --> 37:28.246
- Rob Pilatus, my brother,

37:28.347 --> 37:31.082
he loved "Blame It On The Rain"
because that was--

37:31.182 --> 37:34.353
that was his thing.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.787
- * You said you
didn't need her *

37:35.887 --> 37:39.057
- "Blame It On The Rain" is
number one hit in 1989.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.927
- They released "Baby Don't
Forget My Number," number one.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.863
- "Girl I'm Gonna Miss You"
is the third number one song.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.865
They have three number one
smashes off that record.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.534
- That feels impossible.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.769
- * To satisfy your pride

37:50.869 --> 37:53.872
- And once you have
three big hit singles,

37:53.972 --> 37:56.942
you're gonna sell
a lot of albums.

37:57.042 --> 38:00.546
- If an artist sells 500,000
and went gold, that's terrific.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.280
[crowd screaming]

38:02.381 --> 38:05.817
- * You let her walk away

38:05.917 --> 38:08.620
- If an artist sells a million
albums, that's something.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.121
- * Got to blame it on
something *

38:10.221 --> 38:11.757
- But 8 million?

38:11.857 --> 38:13.959
- It's one of the biggest
debuts of all time.

38:14.059 --> 38:19.164
- * Blame it on the rain
that was falling, falling *

38:19.264 --> 38:22.534
* Blame it on the stars
that didn't shine that night *

38:22.634 --> 38:24.002
- To just come out of nowhere

38:24.102 --> 38:26.605
and have a number one
debut album for seven weeks,

38:26.705 --> 38:29.040
well, that just was unheard of
at the time.

38:29.140 --> 38:33.111
- * Blame it on the rain,
yeah, yeah *

38:33.211 --> 38:37.182
- Debut album,
hot right out of the gate.

38:37.282 --> 38:38.617
"Here's Milli Vanilli.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.051
What do you want to do
with it?"

38:40.151 --> 38:41.987
Well, we want to play it.
We want to dance to it.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.489
We want to have fun with them.

38:43.589 --> 38:46.224
Can we get them in the studio?
We want to meet them.

38:46.324 --> 38:51.363
- * Blame it on the rain
that was falling, falling *

38:51.463 --> 38:53.131
* Blame it on the stars

38:53.231 --> 38:55.300
- At that point,
what are we gonna do?

38:55.401 --> 38:58.670
Should we bring them over?
Should they do the MTV tour?

38:58.770 --> 39:00.972
Then that all kicks in.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.108
- * Blame it on the rain

39:03.208 --> 39:06.044
- Labels saw we were growing
in the charts in America.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.813
- * Blame it on the rain

39:07.913 --> 39:10.416
- Our presence was needed.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.117
[soft dark music]

39:12.217 --> 39:15.887
But Frank didn't want us
to go to America.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.523
- Frank was apprehensive

39:17.623 --> 39:19.991
because of the big secret,
obviously.

39:20.091 --> 39:23.228
- Frank was concerned that
they would go to America

39:23.328 --> 39:25.897
and fuck up everything.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.034
- America had our heart.

39:29.134 --> 39:33.304
"We want to go to the US.
USA! USA!"

39:33.405 --> 39:35.441
[Tone Loc's
"Funky Cold Medina" playing]

39:35.541 --> 39:37.943
*

39:38.043 --> 39:39.911
Coming to LA for us was like

39:40.011 --> 39:42.514
we're living the dream,
we're doing things.

39:42.614 --> 39:43.849
- A'ight?
- Kick it.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.785
- Hollywood, Malibu.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.455
The girls are hot there, too.
Oof.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.557
*

39:51.657 --> 39:53.191
- * Cold coolin' at a bar

39:53.291 --> 39:55.661
- We got a manager,
Sandy Gallin...

39:55.761 --> 39:56.995
- * But like
Mick Jagger said *

39:57.095 --> 39:58.530
- He was like a big player.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.831
- * I can't get
no satisfaction *

39:59.931 --> 40:01.399
- He had Michael Jackson
at the time,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.802
Dolly Parton--tons of people.

40:03.902 --> 40:04.970
That's why he had us,

40:05.070 --> 40:06.472
to handle people like
Milli Vanilli.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.007
- * Funky Cold Medina

40:09.107 --> 40:11.276
- I was truly,
in the beginning, a fan.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.411
I said to them,
"You know, I've never been

40:13.512 --> 40:14.913
a manager before,"

40:15.013 --> 40:19.050
and Rob said, "Well, we've
never been pop stars before."

40:19.150 --> 40:22.120
I was like, "OK, here we go."

40:22.220 --> 40:23.955
[laughs]

40:25.356 --> 40:29.327
My first job was putting them
on the MTV tour.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.963
- It was gonna be
our first tour in America--

40:32.063 --> 40:35.567
a 107 city tour
in eight months--

40:35.667 --> 40:37.769
so we had to put
a band together.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.971
*

40:40.071 --> 40:41.840
- I was the band leader then.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.710
We had rehearsed,
we were flawless.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.278
Everybody was really
invested in this gig

40:47.378 --> 40:50.549
'cause it was
the new hottest shit, you know?

40:50.649 --> 40:52.718
After we had been approved,

40:52.818 --> 40:56.788
Rob and Fab disappeared.
They were gone.

40:56.888 --> 41:00.526
So we were just rehearsing
with no artist.

41:00.626 --> 41:04.896
And I start going, "These guys
must be really, really good.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.098
"They don't rehearse,
they don't fucking do nothing.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.736
They--
what the hell's going on?"

41:10.836 --> 41:12.370
We started asking
more questions.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.206
We got to realize, this musical
director at the time

41:15.306 --> 41:19.611
is programming this Oberheim.
There's where the vocals are.

41:19.711 --> 41:23.348
And then we understood,
"Oh, they're lip-syncing."

41:23.448 --> 41:26.051
So we said, "OK, we're in
a lip-sync band."

41:26.151 --> 41:27.519
[laughs]

41:27.619 --> 41:29.655
They said, "Don't say anything
about this to anybody else."

41:29.755 --> 41:30.856
"Fine."

41:30.956 --> 41:33.859
[hip-hop music]

41:33.959 --> 41:38.196
- The show would play
to packed arenas.

41:38.296 --> 41:43.334
Rob and Fab were two sexy
performers selling hits,

41:43.434 --> 41:46.538
and they did a really
bloody good job at it.

42:28.947 --> 42:31.683

42:31.783 --> 42:34.019
- It was very powerful.

42:41.059 --> 42:44.562
* Girl, you know it's true

42:44.663 --> 42:48.433
- Performing is a drug.

42:48.533 --> 42:53.639
That euphoric feeling allowed
us to just forget everything.

43:02.981 --> 43:06.451
[wild cheering]

the European duo,

43:08.586 --> 43:10.588
now one of the hottest
groups in America,

43:10.689 --> 43:13.792
made a special trip to the
Disney MGM Studios theme parks

43:13.892 --> 43:14.860
where we arranged
for them to have

43:14.960 --> 43:16.427
an exclusive interview session

43:16.527 --> 43:18.664
with some of
their most loyal fans.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.165
- Wherever you've performed,

43:20.265 --> 43:23.334
has anything really
embarrassing happened to you?

43:23.434 --> 43:24.636
- Yeah.

introduces us as usual.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.327
- I decided to take a break--

43:49.427 --> 43:52.463
the show had been going now
for a few months--

43:52.563 --> 43:55.400
and it was while
I was in my trailer

43:55.500 --> 44:00.105
I heard the crowd, like,
getting a little bit rowdy.

44:00.205 --> 44:02.173

being cued from the emulator

Shit!

44:15.787 --> 44:18.189

- As I open my door,
I saw Rob go flying by.

44:22.260 --> 44:25.230
- Rob and Fab were gone,
and I'm onstage still with

44:25.330 --> 44:27.232
the guitar player and the
drummer going "What the fuck?

44:27.332 --> 44:29.701
Do we continue the song on
or what are we doing here?"

44:29.801 --> 44:31.336
[crowd booing]

44:31.436 --> 44:32.704
So, of course,
there was outrage.

44:32.804 --> 44:33.972
I was furious.

44:34.072 --> 44:36.674
"What the fuck, you know?
Find him!"

44:36.775 --> 44:39.811
- Rob was pissed.
He was like, "Fuck that!"

44:39.911 --> 44:42.080
He lost his cool.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.716
- Rob had gotten hold of me
to say,

44:44.816 --> 44:45.884
"I don't know what to do."

44:45.984 --> 44:47.618
You know, he was scared.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.921
*

44:50.021 --> 44:51.322
He kind of exploded.

44:51.422 --> 44:57.128
It was the moment where
it just burst open.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.897
And at that time,
we didn't know

44:58.997 --> 45:02.968
what pressure he was feeling
because we didn't know

45:03.068 --> 45:04.770
the load they were carrying.

45:37.969 --> 45:39.370

WILD radio station, Boston.
1090 on the AM dial.

45:53.118 --> 45:56.387
The guys came to our radio
station for our morning show.

45:56.487 --> 45:57.755
And I remember
them sitting there,

45:57.856 --> 45:59.357
and when I heard them talk
for the first time,

45:59.457 --> 46:01.860
I'm like,
"Oh, they sound very different

46:01.960 --> 46:04.095
than they do on the record."

46:04.195 --> 46:05.296

- Please welcome Milli Vanilli.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.504
- Once they started doing
promotional dates,

46:13.604 --> 46:16.241
it became pretty clear
that something was strange.

46:16.341 --> 46:17.876
- Fab, how are you
finding Australia?

46:17.976 --> 46:19.310
You enjoying it?

46:22.013 --> 46:23.614
- Sydney?

46:23.714 --> 46:25.516
Syd-ney. Syd-ney.

46:26.151 --> 46:29.855
- Melbourne. Melbourne.
[laughter]

46:31.356 --> 46:35.060
- It just seemed that
they weren't comfortable

46:35.160 --> 46:37.295
communicating in English.

46:37.395 --> 46:40.031
- Who inspired you
the most, Rob?

46:40.131 --> 46:42.533
- Uh, diff--difficult.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.170
- You could tell
they were sweating bullets.

46:45.270 --> 46:46.304
People were starting to,
you know,

46:46.404 --> 46:47.973
giggle a little bit
on the sides.

46:48.073 --> 46:49.574
- Fab, you speak English,
right?

46:49.674 --> 46:52.310
- Yeah, I can, too.
- Who are your--[laughs]

46:52.410 --> 46:54.745
- And it was easy to
kind of latch on to that

46:54.846 --> 46:55.813
and make them a joke.

46:55.914 --> 47:00.018
- You are Germany,
and I'm from French.

47:00.118 --> 47:01.887
- Oh.
[laughter]

47:01.987 --> 47:03.621
[explosion]

47:03.721 --> 47:06.391
- There's a way that
I think some people knew.

47:06.491 --> 47:10.628
- [mocking]
* Blame it on the rain

47:10.728 --> 47:12.830
- Arsenio Hall is someone who
had been around the business

47:12.931 --> 47:15.233
a long time and had seen a lot.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.235
- Man, I think Milli Vanilli
doing crack.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.636
I don't think--
[laughter]

47:18.736 --> 47:20.505
- It seemed bad to
a lot of these folks.

47:20.605 --> 47:22.974
- Those pants too tight.
They going--

47:23.074 --> 47:24.809
- They knew something was up.

47:24.910 --> 47:27.345
[cheers and applause]

47:27.445 --> 47:29.414
- Privately, I thought, like,

47:29.514 --> 47:32.383
you know, "Did they really
sing everything?"

47:32.483 --> 47:34.285

- * I'm in love with you, girl,
'cause you're on my mind *

47:48.333 --> 47:50.301
* You're the one I think about
most every time *

47:50.401 --> 47:52.938
- We didn't sing on
those records.

47:53.038 --> 47:55.306
- * Don't you understand, girl,
this love is true *

47:55.406 --> 47:57.675
- We didn't even sound like
those records.

47:57.775 --> 47:59.945
*

48:00.045 --> 48:02.813
We were lying.

while the truth
takes the stairs.

48:18.063 --> 48:21.599
*

48:21.699 --> 48:24.835
I knew that at some point,
the truth would rise.

48:24.936 --> 48:26.938
*

48:27.038 --> 48:29.975
They were gonna catch us
at some point or another.

48:36.681 --> 48:40.018
*

48:40.118 --> 48:43.521
This load on our shoulders,

48:43.621 --> 48:46.657
it was getting heavy and heavy
and heavy.

[wild cheering]

49:18.223 --> 49:21.692

49:24.529 --> 49:26.797
- I was a little bit
tired by it, yeah.

49:36.574 --> 49:40.211
- We drank more,
took more drugs,

49:40.311 --> 49:43.348
to be able to, like, numb out.

50:02.967 --> 50:05.436
- I think next time,
next time, maybe--

50:05.536 --> 50:07.004
should we ask them to sing
next time?

50:07.105 --> 50:09.740
[wild cheering]

50:17.848 --> 50:19.917

Everybody else got

You end up drinking,

52:03.854 --> 52:07.325
you end up taking drugs
to not think about

52:07.425 --> 52:09.927
what's really happening
in reality.

52:10.027 --> 52:13.063
Then my manager that I had
at that time said,

52:13.164 --> 52:15.032
"Well, you know what?

52:15.132 --> 52:19.237
We're gonna do interviews.
You're gonna go live."

52:19.337 --> 52:20.905
I was singing before
Milli Vanilli

52:21.005 --> 52:23.140
even thought about
becoming stars.

52:23.241 --> 52:26.844
I went abroad and said it
in a TV show,

52:26.944 --> 52:28.179
it's my voice.

52:28.279 --> 52:32.217
Music is from Frank Farian
and not from Milli Vanilli.

52:32.317 --> 52:39.257
*

52:40.325 --> 52:43.060
And Frank denied it all.

52:43.160 --> 52:46.297
His words were--I can
remember them to the day--

52:46.397 --> 52:49.267
"This artist is a liar.

52:49.367 --> 52:52.036
"Look the way he's dressed.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.971
"The Black guy.

52:54.071 --> 52:55.506
He's just trying to
make money."

52:55.606 --> 52:58.008
*

53:08.953 --> 53:10.054
- Ingrid!

53:10.154 --> 53:11.789
She said,
"Frank don't want you to be

53:11.889 --> 53:15.025
"talking out there to nobody.
Keep your mouth shut."

53:15.125 --> 53:16.394
"How could you say that?

53:16.494 --> 53:19.430
You're just trying
to get publicity."

53:19.530 --> 53:22.233
Milli Vanilli fans?
Oh, man.

53:22.333 --> 53:24.269
Death threats.

53:24.369 --> 53:29.474
"Your next show, this and this
is gonna happen to you."

53:29.574 --> 53:31.576
- The phone rang and
it was Charles Shaw.

53:31.676 --> 53:33.311
And I didn't know who he was,

53:33.411 --> 53:35.346
and he said, "I'm the real
singer of Milli Vanilli

53:35.446 --> 53:37.448
and you have to help me."

53:37.548 --> 53:39.484
So I called Sandy right away

53:39.584 --> 53:41.619
and I said, "I just got this
weird call from this guy.

53:41.719 --> 53:42.820
He says he's the real voice."

53:42.920 --> 53:46.324
"Ah, just a crazy person.
Just ignore it."

53:46.424 --> 53:49.093
- It didn't interest anybody.

53:49.994 --> 53:54.231
You get tired of trying to

53:54.332 --> 53:57.302
lead a jackass to water

53:57.402 --> 53:59.270
and make him drink it.

54:18.456 --> 54:21.726
[crowd cheering]

54:21.826 --> 54:23.928
- People wanted to believe

54:24.028 --> 54:25.696
they are really singing
these songs

54:25.796 --> 54:27.765
because it was
a good production.

54:27.865 --> 54:29.634
It was entertainment.

54:31.268 --> 54:34.038
- It's a magic trick pulled
off in front of you onstage,

54:34.138 --> 54:36.240
and the audience usually
wants to be deceived

54:36.341 --> 54:37.842
in a magic show.

54:37.942 --> 54:41.346
So if everyone benefits
from a scam like that,

54:41.446 --> 54:42.813
including the audience,

54:42.913 --> 54:45.516
it's very easy to
look the other way.

54:45.616 --> 54:46.751
- Everyone got his bonus,

54:46.851 --> 54:49.086
everyone was happy to be
successful,

54:49.186 --> 54:51.989
and the people are happy to
have this record.

54:52.089 --> 54:57.227
We all together were in
a very nice flow of success.

54:57.328 --> 55:00.164
["Money" playing]

55:00.264 --> 55:02.032
- * Mo-mo-mo-money rules
the world *

55:02.132 --> 55:04.001
* It's still
the same old greed *

55:04.101 --> 55:06.637
- Successful music is
a great money machine.

55:06.737 --> 55:09.139
- Their videos are hot,
their songs are hot.

55:09.239 --> 55:11.075
- Singles, albums,
maxi singles...

55:11.175 --> 55:12.309
- Buy it now.

55:12.410 --> 55:14.979
- The album made
$580 million.

55:15.079 --> 55:18.115
They had sold approximately
46 million records, global.

55:18.215 --> 55:20.284
There was merchandise,
keychains,

55:20.385 --> 55:21.519
ticket sales to the concerts.

55:21.619 --> 55:23.554
- It's Milli Vanilli.
Milli Vanilli!

55:23.654 --> 55:25.623
What a show. What a night.

55:25.723 --> 55:27.425
- We're going to
a Milli Vanilli concert.

55:27.525 --> 55:31.629
- They could've recorded
the alphabet, the phonebook.

55:31.729 --> 55:33.898
You name it,
they were selling it.

55:33.998 --> 55:35.199
- Their logo is
the running man

55:35.299 --> 55:38.135
and it symbolizes
the pursuit of success.

55:38.235 --> 55:39.937
If they do any better
next year,

55:40.037 --> 55:42.072
they're gonna have
to find a new logo.

55:42.172 --> 55:44.174
- At that time,
Frank Farian was worth

55:44.274 --> 55:45.943
almost half a billion.

55:46.043 --> 55:49.146
- * Money rules the world and
don't you love that cash? *

55:49.246 --> 55:51.649
- They continued to steamroll
through the end of the year.

55:51.749 --> 55:54.184
- And the winner is...
Milli Vanilli.

55:54.284 --> 55:55.720
- They won three
American Music Awards...

55:55.820 --> 55:57.354
- Milli Vanilli.

55:57.955 --> 55:59.624
- Milli Vanilli!

55:59.724 --> 56:01.659
- This train was moving.

56:01.759 --> 56:04.862
- Thank you to our producer,
Frank Farian,

56:04.962 --> 56:06.597
to our manager, Sandy Gallin.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.733
- We'd like to thank
Clive Davis.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.801
- * Money rules the world

56:10.901 --> 56:12.837
- Arista, BMG,

56:12.937 --> 56:16.441
they were cashing in
the bucks.

56:16.541 --> 56:18.008
- * Money, money

56:18.108 --> 56:19.910
- And the whole thing with
Milli Vanilli

56:20.010 --> 56:21.278
would have kept going if

56:21.378 --> 56:24.849
they had not been nominated
for the Grammys.

56:27.785 --> 56:30.187
- Well, because--
no, but, see,

56:30.287 --> 56:33.991
most everybody knew
the secret, and I didn't.

56:34.091 --> 56:35.560
They never told me this,

56:35.660 --> 56:38.663
so I just assumed they sang,
you know?

56:38.763 --> 56:40.164
[hip-hop music]

56:40.264 --> 56:43.000
So we're at a conference
meeting and I said,

56:43.100 --> 56:45.102
"I think Milli Vanilli could
get nominated for a Grammy."

56:45.202 --> 56:47.204
I thought "Blame It On
The Rain" was a Grammy song.

56:47.304 --> 56:49.273
They laughed at me and
they're like, "Trust me,

56:49.373 --> 56:52.543
Milli Vanilli's never gonna
get nominated for a Grammy."

56:52.643 --> 56:54.512
So I called
National Academy of

56:54.612 --> 56:56.046
Recording Arts and Sciences.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.815
They put me right through
to Mike Greene's office,

56:57.915 --> 57:00.417
the president of NARAS.

57:00.518 --> 57:03.353
I had no idea how somebody
actually does get nominated,

57:03.454 --> 57:05.355
and he said,
"Oh, you just put it on

57:05.456 --> 57:07.458
"your management company
letterhead,

57:07.558 --> 57:10.595
'please consider
Milli Vanilli for a Grammy.'"

57:10.695 --> 57:13.831
So I typed it up and faxed it
off to the Academy.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.233
Never thought another thing
about it.

57:16.333 --> 57:19.970
So when that ballot came out
and Milli Vanilli was on it,

57:20.070 --> 57:23.173
like, just everything
hit the fan.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.810
Clive called Sandy
and threw a hissy fit,

57:25.910 --> 57:28.546
and then Sandy called me
absolutely furious,

57:28.646 --> 57:30.648
like, "Look what you've done!"

57:30.748 --> 57:32.316
I'm like,

57:32.416 --> 57:34.552
"why doesn't anybody want them
to have a Grammy award?"

57:34.652 --> 57:37.655
[laughs]

57:37.755 --> 57:41.926
[suspicious music]

57:42.026 --> 57:44.995
- If Milli Vanilli had
been nominated for

57:45.095 --> 57:47.264
the lip-sync awards,
that would've been fine,

57:47.364 --> 57:51.902
but they got nominated for
this prestigious musical award

57:52.002 --> 57:53.938
and they were up against
people who produce music

57:54.038 --> 57:55.940
and write music and sing.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.407
They were up against
the Indigo Girls...

57:57.508 --> 58:01.646
- * Closer I am to fine

58:01.746 --> 58:03.614
- This incredible folk duo
who sang

58:03.714 --> 58:05.883
these beautiful, deep songs.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.017
[Tone Loc's
"Funky Cold Medina" playing]

58:07.117 --> 58:08.686
They were up against Tone Loc.

58:08.786 --> 58:10.320
- * Funky Cold Medina

58:10.420 --> 58:13.323
- Tone Loc made brilliantly
constructed records,

58:13.423 --> 58:16.026
full of incredibly clever
rhythmic artifice.

58:16.126 --> 58:18.128
- * Sweetness
- Neneh Cherry, who had

58:18.228 --> 58:21.231
a really interesting debut
album and had a lot to say.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.833
- * We always hang in
a buffalo stance *

58:22.933 --> 58:25.002
- * Back to life

58:25.102 --> 58:29.339
- Soul II Soul changed
the way R&B music sounded.

58:29.439 --> 58:31.976
They changed the way
music moved.

58:32.076 --> 58:34.912
- And so, if I'm one of those
artists,

58:35.012 --> 58:36.446
I'm like, "These guys?"

58:36.547 --> 58:39.249
*

58:39.349 --> 58:44.254
- We knew that the Grammys
were the highest standard.

58:44.354 --> 58:47.124
[resonant music]

58:47.224 --> 58:51.395
Then here we were,
you know, Rob and Fab.

58:51.495 --> 58:56.433
Not only that,
they want us to perform live.

58:56.533 --> 59:00.337
- I thought, how the hell are
they going to do the Grammys

59:00.437 --> 59:01.939
when it's all live?

59:06.443 --> 59:08.478
Live-sing.

59:21.091 --> 59:24.261
- Michael Greene was
the head of NARAS at the time.

59:24.361 --> 59:28.999
I remember taking a picture
with him, and him saying,

59:29.099 --> 59:31.802
"Be sure you do it right
tonight."

59:31.902 --> 59:33.904
- [whistles]

59:34.004 --> 59:36.140
Money, money, money
makes the world go 'round.

59:38.108 --> 59:43.447
[tense music]

59:43.547 --> 59:45.149
- We're at the Shrine.

59:45.249 --> 59:49.019
I remember getting out
of the car and going in.

59:49.119 --> 59:51.355
On that day, it was pressure.

59:51.455 --> 59:52.456
[applause]

59:52.556 --> 59:53.357
- Ladies and gentlemen,

59:53.457 --> 59:55.960
Mr. Mike Greene.
- Thank you.

59:56.060 --> 59:57.762
This is a great night
for music!

59:57.862 --> 59:59.429
[applause]

59:59.529 --> 01:00:01.298
- Yeah, boy!

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:04.368
- All the stars are
in the building.

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:06.503
- Woo-hoo!

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:10.941
- Finally, it was our turn
to be on that stage.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.343
Cold sweat.
[whistles]

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.012
- Well, girl,
you know it's true.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:18.215
It can only mean Milli Vanilli.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:21.585
[fanfare]

01:00:21.686 --> 01:00:23.120
- Hit it!

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.223
["Girl You Know It's True"

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:32.296
*

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.598
- * I'm in love with you, girl,
'cause you're on my mind *

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:37.134
* You're the one I think about
most every time *

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:39.503
* And when you pack a smile
in everything you do *

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:41.071
- Performing in front of
the Grammys

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:44.308
with all those artists,
that was nerve wracking.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:47.812
- * And this is true
- * Girl, you know it's true

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:51.716
- All those people who spent
years of their lives

01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:53.250
to get to this point,

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.252
and we got here pretty fast.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:01:00.524
*

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:03.593
[cheers and applause]

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.535
- I remember sitting there,

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:14.238
and I think the entire industry
knew at that time

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.273
that it wasn't them singing.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:17.775
- [clears throat]
That was great.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.944
I was actually--I was supposed
to be in that number.

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:22.312
I don't know what--
[laughter]

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:25.049
- When he called out
the nominees,

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:27.417
you know, it was like, "Man."

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.319
- This year, the nominees for
Best New Artist

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:31.789
are making all kinds of music.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.759
- Each one of them express
themself in a unique way

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:37.027
that commands attention.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:40.164
- Now, the nominees for
Best New Artist are...

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:43.734
- Do Rob and Fab
deserve the Grammy?

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:45.669
- Neneh Cherry.

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.838
- That's a tough one.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.975
We didn't sing on
the record, so...

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.209
- Indigo Girls.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.644
- No.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:56.146
But...

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:57.948
[tense music]

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.483
[cheers and applause]

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:00.818
- Milli Vanilli.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:03.754
- For the pain and everything
that we suffered...

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.255
- Soul II Soul.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:07.825
- And the hard work that
we put into,

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:09.159
do we deserve it?

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:10.560
- Tone Loc.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.329
*

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:16.066
- A very small part of me
says yes.

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.002
*

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:20.337
- And the Best New Artist is...

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.407
- Rob and Fab deserved
the Grammy.

01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:25.075
- Milli Vanilli.

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:30.247
[cheers and applause]

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.720
"Oh, my God."

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:39.756
Frank goes,
"Now, everybody's watching."

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:50.300
[cheers and applause]

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:53.203
- Uh, we want to say
thank you very much,

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.940
but we want to say
there are a lot of artists

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.607
here in this room,

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:00.410
there are a lot of artists
outside in the world

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.547
who could achieve the same
award that we achieved today,

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.715
and it's an award for
all artists in the world.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.151
Thank you very much.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.718
[cheers and applause]

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:11.255
- Thank you.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:13.257
- It was a joke
that went too far.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:16.326
And once they crossed
that line into

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:20.497
something that
people really care about,

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.667
that was the beginning of
the end for Rob and Fab.

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:27.637
- Once they won the Grammy...

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.140
*

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.643
Once they won the Grammy,

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:36.180
they hung they selves.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.783
[cheers fading]

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:45.489
[mysterious music]

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:49.459
*

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:52.262
- The afterparty
for the Grammys,

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:54.764
oh, man, we were already faded.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:59.469
*

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:02.907
I remember having to listen
to Mr. Clive Davis.

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:05.142
*

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.411
We were so high

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:09.279
that it took a lot of energy

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:12.049
to just keep the stuff
together.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:14.818
*

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:19.556
- Frankly, Rob and Fab didn't
do themselves any favors.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:21.892
*

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:25.896
They were just acting arrogant
and, frankly, obnoxious.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:42.612
"I have no time.
Who's Paul McCartney?"

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.449
[hip-hop music]

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:49.553
- When they won,
Rob and Fab were way up here,

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:51.821
these big stars that
just won a Grammy.

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:52.990
And the bigger they got,

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.692
the more celebrity
they became.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.529
They had to have Avión
in the limousine,

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.365
sushi in the dressing room.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:04.168
- They wanted for nothing.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:06.803
- The stardom made them crazy.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.606
- Rob said, "Oh,
can you turn on my voice?"

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:12.509
And Frank said,
"It's not your voice!"

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.345
Believe it.
It's Brad Howell's voice.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:19.116
- He was singing with
my voice during playback

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:21.251
and believing
that's his own voice.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.420
They were believing this.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.456
- They started to forget
the reality

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:28.358
that they didn't sing.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.394
[tense music]

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.895
- So they were doing
this interview one time

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:33.630
and they said they were better
than The Beatles.

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:38.435
*

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.304
Think about waking up
every day and knowing that

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:41.805
you don't sing
any of the vocals,

01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:43.640
and then saying you're better
than The Beatles.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.875
*

01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:48.578
I mean, that takes, like,
giant stones.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:52.082
You've really gotta believe
your own bullshit to say that.

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:55.585
They got caught up in it.

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.988
- At that point, they thought
they had the power,

01:05:58.088 --> 01:05:59.623
and they did, to some degree.

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:02.159
They said, you know,
"We're in control now."

01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:04.428
*

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:06.530
Millions and millions of
dollars were at stake

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.899
and people depended on them.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.236
Frank depended on them.

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:14.438
Clive depended on them.

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:18.075
Everybody depended on
Milli Vanilli doing their job.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:20.110
*

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.447
- Frank Farian was already
preparing album number two,

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:25.149
"Keep On Running,"
and they wanted us

01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:31.488
to get back to Germany to go
promote the second album.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:35.859
But Rob and Fab were done.

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:38.362
We wanted to sing.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.964
We wanted to come out
as singers.

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:45.369
[soft dark music]

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:49.273
- At Arista,
we had a weekly luncheon

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:52.142
in the conference room.

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:55.745
One day, Clive got a call and
he walked into the kitchen.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:00.050
And then came back out
and he goes,

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:04.121
"They want to sing on
the second album."

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:08.392
And I remember him saying,
"That's not gonna happen."

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:18.535
"Oh, but I would like to sing."

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.570
"Yeah, Rob, it's impossible.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.639
"You cannot sing and
Fab cannot sing,

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.608
so please stop talking."

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:30.580
- We couldn't continue
to be his marionette.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.782
Hey, listen.
[flaps lips]

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.551
Done with this.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:37.187
So we started to lawyer up,

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:39.389
and then that's when
we found out

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:43.927
we signed a contract
for multiple albums.

01:07:44.027 --> 01:07:45.862
We had no clue.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:50.100
So to get out of under
the thumb of Frank Farian,

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.002
we played a game
of cat and mouse.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.538
*

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:58.041
Our MO was to hurt him.

01:07:58.142 --> 01:08:01.111
Let's push him to a brink
where he's gonna break,

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.913
and then he's gonna say,
"You know what? I'm tired.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.915
Go away."

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:07.551
You know, we didn't show up
to the video of

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.653
"Keep On Running."

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:13.323
And we told him,
"More money. More money."

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.024
He's like,
"No, I'm not doing that!

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:16.826
What else do you want?"

01:08:24.168 --> 01:08:27.237
They told Frank,
"If you don't give us 150,000,

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:29.439
"we will go to the producer
and telling them that

01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:32.108
we are not the guys
who singing on the tape."

01:08:53.797 --> 01:08:56.800
["Girl I'm Gonna Miss You"
playing]

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:02.506
*

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:05.342
- The story broke in
"The Los Angeles Times"

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:06.376
and all hell broke loose.

01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:12.916
*

01:09:16.686 --> 01:09:18.755
- Frank threw Rob and Fab
under the bus.

01:09:18.855 --> 01:09:22.492
- * I knew it from the start,
you would break my heart *

01:09:22.592 --> 01:09:25.762
* But still, I had to play
this painful part *

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:28.265
* You wrapped me around
your little bitty finger *

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.716
- He basically brushed it off
and said,

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:47.984
"You know, yeah,
they didn't sing..."

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:51.154
- * I just don't know
what I should do *

01:09:51.255 --> 01:09:52.956
- "And who cares?"

01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.863
- Very quickly after that,

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:02.332
the whole train
came off the tracks.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:09.038
- * It's a tragedy for me
to see the dream is over *

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:12.976
* And I never will forget
the day we met *

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:14.611
* Girl, I'm gonna miss you

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:18.014
[ominous music]

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:20.550
- The pop music world's
in shock tonight--

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.185
- With the revelation that
pop duo--

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:23.520
- Milli Vanilli didn't sing.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.988
- So, girl, you know
it's not true.

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.957
- Well, I am shocked.
[audience laughs]

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.760
- It was the lead-in story
on all the news.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.928
- More embarrassment today

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.830
for the pop singing group
Milli Vanilli.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:38.502
- Milli Vanilli turns out to be
a lot of phony baloney.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:41.605
- And it didn't just
hit America;

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:43.072
it hit worldwide.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.783
- One pop group this week
has been involved in

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:55.385
a feverish controversy.

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:57.153
- And then NARAS got involved.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.689
- There's too many doubts
that have been cast now

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:02.826
for us not to go forward and
try to find out the truth.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:06.730
The credibility of
the Grammy depends on it.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.833
- Having to give back
their Grammy,

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:15.171
it's the only time that has
happened in music history.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.174
- There was no recovering
from that.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:22.612
The only way that that could be
ridden was to own it.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:26.583
[indistinct chatter]

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:29.919
- Robert Pilatus
and Fabrice Morvan.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.125
- Come together. Come together.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:38.328
- Come together, guys!
- Right here! Right here!

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:40.897
- Right here.
- Straight ahead.

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:43.533
- Fabrice and me,
we lived together in a project

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:46.102
with two other musicians
in Munich.

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:48.638
We--we had nothing to eat.
We weren't happy.

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:51.841
We wanted to be stars.
We want to get up on top.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:53.943
So suddenly, this guy gave us
a chance and we took it.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:55.612
He gave us a little bit money.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:59.282
- We were young, naive,
and we believed him.

01:11:59.383 --> 01:12:01.150
It was an opportunity for us.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.220
- We feel really, really sorry
about our fans,

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.758
but we just hope that they
understand that we were young,

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:11.294
that we just wanted to live
the life the American way.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:20.737
- Of course.
Yeah.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.772
- You're absolutely right.
I was seduced.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:24.674
You have to understand
we were seduced,

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:27.677
we were abused,
and we felt very guilty,

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:28.845
and we're happy that
it's over, you know?

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:31.047
We don't understand
that it's us,

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:32.982
the two little guys
from Germany,

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.184
the victims who has
to play suddenly

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.921
the crux of a trial
that we are not.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.131
- I will describe it like this.

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:49.298
You get something,

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:51.334
but for that, you make
a pact with the devil.

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:57.707
- I think you should
go with this tape.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:12:59.008
We give you each a tape.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.244
You can take it to
a scientist--

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:03.513
- But you could--

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:04.748
- OK, I demonstrate!

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:07.917
Fuck it. I do it. Let's do it.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:11.421
* Girl, you know it's true

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:15.925
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.127
- * I'm in love with you, girl,
'cause you're on my mind *

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.396
* You're the one I think about
most every time *

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:23.099
* When you crack a smile
in everything you do *

01:13:27.471 --> 01:13:29.105
- Yeah, I understand--
I really understand them.

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:31.107
I have to say
I understand them.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:40.917
- That's a good question, but--
- A lot of your fans--

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:43.820
a lot of your fans will be
very upset by the fact

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.990
that the only way
you can explain the charade,

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.959
the farce, the fakery of
the last year, two years,

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:52.028
is money.
- It's not.

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:53.730
This is fame--
- There's no other reason.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:56.165
That's the only pressure
that Farian put on you,

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.001
was financial--
- Do you live in a project?

01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.836
Did you live in a project?

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:03.006
We had no money,
we wanted to be stars.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:06.275
We think we are talented.
We love to be onstage.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.444
That's our first aim.
It wasn't money.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:11.080
If we wouldn't have accept that
at the start,

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.916
we knew we would be
still in Munich.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:14.317
I would still work at
the McDonalds.

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:17.120
- OK, thank you very much.

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:19.122
- Thank you very much.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:32.135
[indistinct chatter]

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.413
- They ate 'em up like sharks.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.951
- They were
the town spectacle.

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:52.088
- New weasel boys of
the record world.

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:54.357
Did you know they were exposed
for not actually appearing on

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:55.825
their Grammy-award winning
record album?

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:57.226
- They do not sing...

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.795
- Do not sing on it at all.
- On their own record.

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:01.531
- * Ooh, ooh, ooh,
you are through *

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.499
[laughter]

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.303
- The response was swift
and it was harsh.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.874
They stopped playing on radio,

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:13.009
Arista Records took it
out of circulation,

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:14.578
and then, to top it all off,

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:17.013
there were, like, two dozen
class action lawsuits

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:18.715
from fans who were just pissed.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:21.685
- A California woman who
bought the album for her son

01:15:21.785 --> 01:15:23.519
is suing to get a refund.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.821
- When I listened to the music,

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:26.990
I would sort of picture them
singing,

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:28.792
and that's--that's how
I looked up to them.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.127
- They sued them for fraud
and racketeering.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.829
- Listen carefully
to this important message

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:34.197
about a pending
Milli Vanilli lawsuit

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:37.133
that may affect your rights.

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:39.969
- I remember being surprised
by the animosity,

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:41.771
and the amount of anger
behind that

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.840
seemed outsized
for what happened.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.675
- I mean, Milli Vanilli,
to be clear,

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:48.144
had a largely white audience,

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:51.347
so a part of the betrayal
that was felt was,

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:53.116
"I can't believe
I listened to these Black guys

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:54.350
singing these songs and
it really wasn't them."

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:55.819
- You're gonna have
a movie now,

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:58.221
"The Milli Vanilli Story."
Is that beautiful?

01:15:58.321 --> 01:16:00.757
I play Fab, one of the dudes
in Milli Vanilli.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:04.594
- * Girl, I love you
- * I love you

01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:08.097
- It was really ugly to see
that sort of hostility

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:10.867
directed at Rob and Fab.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.602
- Rob Pilatus told
"The LA Times" that

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:16.673
his family back in Germany was
getting harassed as well.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:23.412
- Management was gone.

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:26.082
Label was gone.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.451
- No representative of
a major record company

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:32.789
would discuss them with CNN
on camera.

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:35.458
- Frank came out of it
unscathed.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:52.075
- Rob and Fab deserved to
be called out, certainly.

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:54.678
But it was weird that
people didn't come down on

01:16:54.778 --> 01:16:57.714
Frank and Arista and Clive

01:16:57.814 --> 01:17:00.283
in the way that
you would think.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:02.118
There was plausible
deniability, I think,

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:03.586
for Arista, anyway.

01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:06.322
I mean, it was easy for them
to say, "We didn't know,"

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:08.557
and nobody could prove that
they knew it,

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.760
so they got off the hook.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.845
- I mean,
I just know personally,

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:30.313
that we knew before
the Grammys,

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.415
so there's no--there was
no question about it.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.184
- Yeah, maybe six months
before.

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:38.354
[soft tense music]

01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:40.623
*

01:17:40.724 --> 01:17:42.926
"Why didn't anybody from
the label speak out,"

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:44.660
is that what you're asking me?

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.229
- Yeah.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:48.164
- That's a--
that's a good question.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:50.166
I mean, I can't--

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:53.770
I have to answer truthfully,

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.505
and I would have to say that,

01:17:56.605 --> 01:18:00.343
that, yeah, I believe that
Clive felt that this

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:02.445
not only wasn't good
for Arista,

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:05.348
but wasn't really good for
his reputation

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:07.717
and for his, you know, history.

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:13.222
- The record company and
industry has all of the power,

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:15.424
so they're gonna use
everything they can

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:19.028
to point the direction at
Rob and Fab.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:20.764
"Don't look at,
we sold these million records.

01:18:20.864 --> 01:18:24.400
"Don't look at the fact that
someone inside of our industry

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.136
"had to have known
this was going on.

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:30.874
"No, it's these two guys
who barely speak English.

01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:33.209
It's their fault."

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:49.859
- Not only did Frank have
no problem

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.261
exploiting Rob and Fab,

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:55.999
but he also seemed to
think them foolish

01:18:56.099 --> 01:18:59.368
and beneath him.

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:01.737
And just like his lineage of

01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:06.209
treating Black artists as
disposable,

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:11.080
he chose to get what he needed
and disposed of them.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:12.581
- We regret it.
- We regretted it...

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.017
200,000 times.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:15.785
Lying in front of my mom,

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:17.153
lying in front of the job.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.621
- Everybody.
- Lying in front of everybody.

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:21.825
- They were young,
just like me,

01:19:21.925 --> 01:19:24.861
looking to achieve something

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:27.196
in the music branch,

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:29.532
just like me.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:32.168
So what do you do?

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.903
[soft resonant music]

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:39.142
You followed the light,
but it's the wrong light.

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:42.846
At the end of the tunnel,
the light goes out,

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:45.982
and what happens?

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:48.852
Don't nobody care.

01:19:48.952 --> 01:19:50.920
*

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.590
It's just another scandal.

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:57.326
- And the number one new job
for Milli Vanilli, "Who cares?

01:19:57.426 --> 01:20:00.429
Just as long as we don't
hear from them ever again."

01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:08.171
[soft music]

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:10.439
*

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.292
*

01:20:54.283 --> 01:21:00.957
*

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:04.093
- Just when you thought
there couldn't possibly be

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.528
another twist to the story--

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.676
- So, you know,
the thing about Frank,

01:21:20.776 --> 01:21:22.678
he's always a step ahead
of everybody, right?

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:25.148
[funky pop music]

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:27.416
He had already recorded
the second record,

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:28.985
and he dropped it,

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:31.120
like, right after
this whole thing blew up.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.490
*

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:36.525
- Frank Farian called me up
and said,

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:40.163
"John, now you and Brad are
gonna be stars of the show."

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:42.431
* Elaborate on the microphone

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:44.333
* Pumping some knowledge
'cause my brain ain't stoned *

01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:45.969
- It's called
The Real Milli Vanilli,

01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:48.304
"The Moment of Truth."

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:52.275
But again,
it's all another facade.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:53.876
This guy was never
in the band.

01:21:53.977 --> 01:21:56.679
He's just another guy
who Frank recruited.

01:21:56.779 --> 01:21:58.781
- That girl had nothing to
do with the first album,

01:21:58.881 --> 01:22:01.184
she had nothing to do with
the second album.

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:04.820
- We are still on that album,
Jodie and I.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.292
But Frank said, no touring,
no video, no being seen.

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:11.560
- * Listen to what he says

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.795
- "Linda, hope you understand.

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:14.197
"I have a certain
look that I want.

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:15.698
You're not Black."

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:17.900
- * I'm not into bragging,
strutting, or bigotry *

01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:19.768
* Or bigotry

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:22.305
- Don't ask me how I felt.
Well, go ahead, ask me.

01:22:22.405 --> 01:22:24.173
- Yeah, how did you feel?
- I felt horrible!

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.975
- Oh, I was incensed.

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:29.712
- * Keep on running, baby

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:32.081
- You've got to be kidding me.

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:34.883
It was almost as big a lie
as the first Milli Vanilli.

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:36.485
- * Keep on running

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:38.988
- This was Frank's MO.
- * Baby

01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:40.923
- He already did Boney M.,

01:22:41.024 --> 01:22:44.693
and then Milli Vanilli,
and he's like, "Hey, man,

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.729
this is
my 'Fast and Furious 10'."

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:48.231
I'm just gonna keep
making these things

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:50.333
because you love 'em,"

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:54.037
so why would
he change his stripes?

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:58.007
[applause]

01:22:58.107 --> 01:23:01.210
- Do you know what they are
doing now, Rob and Fab?

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:02.945
- Well, they have
a new single out--

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:05.214
- It's not out yet.
- It's not out actually.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:06.749
They don't--
they don't have a label.

01:23:06.849 --> 01:23:08.851
A lot of record companies are
scared to touch them right now

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:11.120
because, well, if you know
somebody can't sing,

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:12.421
why produce them?

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:14.923
- So you want to sing
a little bit for us?

01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:17.426
- Yeah, we come in here
with our live band

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:18.527
and we would love to sing.

01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:19.995
- No, how about right now?

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:21.397
Sing something off your album.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.866
- Um...
- [clears throat]

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:25.768
- Some of the verse from
the first single?

01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:28.371
- Uh, yeah, OK.

01:23:28.471 --> 01:23:30.973
* Girl
Back together.

01:23:31.074 --> 01:23:32.275
- * Girl

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:36.512
both:
* Do you want to get it on

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:40.616
* Then tell me now

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:44.287
- Now Rob and Fab are
courageously trying to

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:46.889
make a comeback,
real voices and all.

01:23:46.989 --> 01:23:50.193
both: * I just want to be
your everything *

01:23:50.293 --> 01:23:52.795
- For the last year, they've
been working on a new album,

01:23:52.895 --> 01:23:55.298
on the dance steps,
and on the singing.

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:57.566
They've got a new sexy video.

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:01.537
- * Girl, can you tell me now

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:04.173
* Straight up what's up

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:06.309
-* So what's a man
supposed to do *

01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:11.714
* Oh
- * Do you want to get it on

01:24:12.915 --> 01:24:15.551
- So this is
the "We Can Get It On"

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:19.222
12 inch LP single by Rob & Fab.

01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:21.357
They're just, like, badasses,
you know?

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:23.392
They're like,
"Yeah, we're hot. We know it."

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:24.660
[laughs]

01:24:26.095 --> 01:24:30.032
The expectation of the record
was based on curiosity alone

01:24:30.133 --> 01:24:33.702
they could sell a million
copies of the record.

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:38.841
But the Rob & Fab album
sold 2,000 copies worldwide,

01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:42.711
which is not good.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.681
- By the time the
Rob & Fab record came out,

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:48.016
people were just
not that interested

01:24:48.117 --> 01:24:49.318
in the spectacle anymore.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:52.521
*

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:14.377
- That's when we...grew apart.

01:25:14.477 --> 01:25:18.681
Rob was going in
his own tunnel

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:21.584
and didn't want to come out,
really.

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:44.139
- The team Rob and Fab
had fractured.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.612
He didn't see me as--
as his brother anymore.

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.980
And that hurt.

01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:26.081
- Now, where have you been
for the past six years?

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:28.016
- Well, the past six years,
I was in Los Angeles

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.618
undercover, you know,
doing my thing.

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:31.186
- You have an accent.
Where are you from?

01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:32.187
- I'm from Paris. I'm French.

01:26:32.288 --> 01:26:33.522
- From Paris.
- Yeah.

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:35.258
- Now, listen,
you've got some new music...

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:36.625
- That's true, yeah.

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:38.794
- And you are actually singing
on this damn thing.

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:40.663
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:26:40.763 --> 01:26:42.865
Put it together
for Fabrice Morvan.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:44.667
["Love Revolution" playing]

01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:47.736
- * Come on, children

01:26:47.836 --> 01:26:50.473
both:
* If you see what I see

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:52.875
* And you know what I feel

01:26:52.975 --> 01:26:55.010
- For me,
performing was vindication.

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:58.647
both:
* And we'll find a solution

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:01.750
- I was able to, like,
blossom as a singer

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:04.086
and do what I was supposed
to do in the first place.

01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:10.293
* Everybody,
join the love revolution *

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:12.495
[cheers and applause]

01:27:12.595 --> 01:27:14.297
- Lovely!
- Come on.

01:27:14.397 --> 01:27:15.664
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:18.133
- Hey, listen.
Do you ever see Rob anymore?

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:20.469
- Well, we don't talk
as much as we used to

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:21.604
because he's doing
his own thing,

01:27:21.704 --> 01:27:22.738
I'm doing my own thing,
you know?

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:24.172
We kind of went apart,
you know?

01:27:24.273 --> 01:27:26.041
Bands broke up and
they do their own thing.

01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:27.376
- Sure.
- That's what happened.

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:28.677
- You done joined
the love revolution.

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:30.579
- That's right.
- Where do I sign up?

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:33.516
[soft dramatic music]

01:27:33.616 --> 01:27:35.584
*

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:40.022
- I was at The Viper Room.

01:27:40.122 --> 01:27:42.825
I was outside.

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:47.530
I see a dude stumbling
across the way.

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:50.533
As he was falling,
his body turned

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:52.835
and I looked into his eyes
and I was like,

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:55.270
"Oh, my God. This is not true."

01:27:57.906 --> 01:28:01.677
I'm looking at Rob Pilatus.

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:03.446
So I crossed the street,

01:28:03.546 --> 01:28:04.780
I picked him up,

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.184
and I said, "Hey, Rob.
It's Fab."

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.555
"Rob, it's Fab.

01:28:12.655 --> 01:28:14.923
Where do you live?"

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:18.126
And then he said, "There.

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:22.064
So we ring the doorbell.

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:23.732
We're like,
"Hey, we're there with Rob.

01:28:23.832 --> 01:28:26.602
Like, this is
where he live, yes?"

01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:29.004
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bring him in.

01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:30.673
"It's our boy, man.
We--you know,

01:28:30.773 --> 01:28:33.108
he--sometimes,
he just wanders."

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:35.378
And I'm like,
"Oh, that looks like

01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:36.645
a crack house to me, man."

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:38.847
*

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:43.318
They were doing heavy drugs
in that--in that room.

01:28:45.087 --> 01:28:49.725
I'm not surprised
'cause I heard

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:52.395
that's what he's been doing
for a long time.

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:55.297
But to actually see

01:28:55.398 --> 01:28:58.534
my brother in the street

01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:00.969
looking like this,

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:04.673
and looking back at
my dude in his prime...

01:29:04.773 --> 01:29:08.711
*

01:29:08.811 --> 01:29:12.548
Man, it was like, "Phew."

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:16.218
I didn't know what to say.

01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:35.438
[soft dramatic music]

01:29:35.538 --> 01:29:42.344
*

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:59.528
- What'd they do?
They just pulled you over?

01:29:59.628 --> 01:30:01.096
- Yeah, they pulled me over,
man.

01:30:01.196 --> 01:30:02.465
Unfortunately.

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:16.211
- He was lost.
Everything had failed.

01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:19.414
He had not been satisfied with
anything that he'd ever done.

01:30:38.233 --> 01:30:41.203
*

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:30.418
- He came back from
Oberberg Clinic

01:31:30.519 --> 01:31:35.423
and he stayed at a hotel
close to my house.

01:31:35.524 --> 01:31:38.393
Next morning, 10:00,
I called, no answer.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:39.628
11:00, no answer.

01:31:39.728 --> 01:31:41.463
12:00, no answer.

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:46.001
At 2:00, I said, "I'm going to
the hotel right now."

01:31:46.101 --> 01:31:50.005
And we go to his door

01:31:50.105 --> 01:31:52.675
and the chain was from inside,

01:31:52.775 --> 01:31:56.244
so the house master
has to open it.

01:31:58.581 --> 01:32:02.918
And--and he was laying there
on--on the floor,

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:06.922
just with shorts.

01:32:09.725 --> 01:32:11.193
Yeah.

01:32:11.293 --> 01:32:12.661
And I was...

01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:54.670
- The call came in.

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.972
"Rob is dead."

01:32:57.973 --> 01:33:00.108
I was like, "Wow."

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:04.512
And then I went into, like,
a state of shock.

01:33:04.613 --> 01:33:08.450
And I didn't move for
a long time.

01:33:14.823 --> 01:33:17.660
[somber music]

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:24.733
*

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:24.159
*

01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:31.666
- I lost a family member.

01:34:31.767 --> 01:34:33.869
*

01:34:33.969 --> 01:34:35.804
I lost a brother.

01:34:35.904 --> 01:34:39.007
*

01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:43.678
I lost someone that was there
with me, walking in my shoes.

01:34:43.779 --> 01:34:48.083
*

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:50.652
[softly]
You know?

01:34:50.753 --> 01:34:52.454
[sniffles,
chuckles softly]

01:34:54.556 --> 01:34:56.191
That's it.

01:35:13.876 --> 01:35:17.980
When I went to Holland,

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.249
I was running away
from my past.

01:35:24.686 --> 01:35:28.090
- He'd introduced himself
as Fabrice,

01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:31.393
but I didn't know who he was.

01:35:33.428 --> 01:35:35.230
He had such short hair,

01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:39.167
and he has a different face
when he has short hair.

01:35:39.267 --> 01:35:40.936
So in the beginning, actually,
when we were dating,

01:35:41.036 --> 01:35:42.604
people were like,
"Hey, Tessa, hey, Tessa."

01:35:42.704 --> 01:35:44.739
"Hey, I'll see you tomorrow,"
and, you know,

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.208
I was the one being recognized.

01:35:46.308 --> 01:35:51.579
So there was no signs that
he was Milli Vanilli.

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:53.782
[soft music]

01:35:53.882 --> 01:35:55.283
We had just fun together,

01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:56.751
and we were working out
together,

01:35:56.852 --> 01:35:59.287
and we had those dates.

01:35:59.387 --> 01:36:01.356
I start to really
like this guy,

01:36:01.456 --> 01:36:03.091
and you talk with
your friends about,

01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:06.328
you know,
your new dating experience.

01:36:06.428 --> 01:36:08.696
One of them said,
"Dude, that's Milli Vanilli.

01:36:08.797 --> 01:36:10.198
Hello."
[chuckles]

01:36:10.298 --> 01:36:11.766
And I was like, "Well, OK.

01:36:11.867 --> 01:36:13.401
"If that's Milli Vanilli, fine,

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.437
because I like Fabrice, so..."

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:24.579
- I didn't think she would,
like, want to be with me.

01:36:24.679 --> 01:36:29.117
I had to tell her, "Listen,
my life is not great."

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:31.987
- I was like,
"Well, don't worry, you know?

01:36:32.087 --> 01:36:33.755
I got you."

01:36:33.856 --> 01:36:36.825
[pan sizzling]

01:36:38.827 --> 01:36:39.962
- You already, Sach?

01:36:40.062 --> 01:36:41.129
Drum roll.

01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:43.731
- One, two, and three.

01:36:43.832 --> 01:36:46.668
Flip!
- Oh!

01:36:46.768 --> 01:36:48.871
When Sacha came,

01:36:48.971 --> 01:36:51.206
when Solange came,

01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:56.544
and now Vince and Paris came,

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.347
then things started
flourishing all around me.

01:36:59.447 --> 01:37:01.216
What?
- Hey, Sacha, look!

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.717
He's holding the bottle.
- [giggles]

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.352
- That's a first.

01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:06.588
Look at that.
- Cute.

01:37:06.688 --> 01:37:09.091
[laughter]

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:11.493
- It's amazing

01:37:11.593 --> 01:37:14.829
to realize that
there is another side

01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:16.965
at the end of the tunnel.

01:37:17.065 --> 01:37:18.833
- Together.
- Together?

01:37:18.934 --> 01:37:22.104
- Pink.
- You want pink? OK.

01:37:22.204 --> 01:37:24.372
It changed everything for me,

01:37:24.472 --> 01:37:26.774
and that part was like,
"Hey..."

01:37:26.875 --> 01:37:28.276
Well done, Sach.

01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:32.047
"You don't have to be ashamed
about nothing."

01:37:32.147 --> 01:37:38.653
*

01:37:39.821 --> 01:37:41.389
- Because of the way
human beings and

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:44.526
their minds are built,

01:37:44.626 --> 01:37:49.731
Milli Vanilli's legacy is
they deceived the public

01:37:49.831 --> 01:37:53.668
and tried to get away with it,
and then they didn't.

01:37:53.768 --> 01:37:58.006
But what it should be
is a cautionary tale.

01:37:58.106 --> 01:38:00.909
*

01:38:01.009 --> 01:38:04.212
- All of the answers about
how pop music is made

01:38:04.312 --> 01:38:07.882
rest in this story.

01:38:07.983 --> 01:38:12.154
What we want to believe
our pop musicians to be

01:38:12.254 --> 01:38:13.688
versus what they actually are.

01:38:13.788 --> 01:38:17.425
*

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:22.664
- Show business is all part of
an illusion.

01:38:22.764 --> 01:38:26.168
- But that is what pop music
is supposed to do.

01:38:26.268 --> 01:38:28.971
It's supposed to take us to
an elsewhere.

01:38:29.071 --> 01:38:31.373
*

01:38:31.473 --> 01:38:35.143
Even if we say, "These people
deceived the public,"

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:36.878
so fucking what?

01:38:36.979 --> 01:38:38.913
[cheers and applause]

01:38:39.014 --> 01:38:40.582
Who was this harming?

01:38:40.682 --> 01:38:45.153
*

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:48.490
- * Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:51.059
I've met people that told me,

01:38:51.159 --> 01:38:53.495
"Because of your voice,

01:38:53.595 --> 01:38:56.064
my daughter's here today."
[chuckles]

01:38:57.599 --> 01:39:00.902
- It was such a big thing
for a lot of people.

01:39:01.003 --> 01:39:05.173
- So many people went to their
high school prom with that.

01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:08.043
That was good music,

01:39:08.143 --> 01:39:09.544
and it's good music today.

01:39:09.644 --> 01:39:11.946
[cheers and applause]

01:39:12.047 --> 01:39:14.216
- There's no real crime here,

01:39:14.316 --> 01:39:15.317
if we're being honest.

01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:19.021
*

01:39:19.121 --> 01:39:21.023
But it cost a life.

01:39:21.123 --> 01:39:24.426
*

01:39:24.526 --> 01:39:29.664
It also cost both of them
lives that they could have had.

01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:33.568
*

01:39:33.668 --> 01:39:38.240
And the heartbreaking thing is
that their legacy then became

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.675
that of a punch line.

01:39:40.775 --> 01:39:46.948
*

01:39:48.016 --> 01:39:54.422
- There was a time when
I would avoid going in public

01:39:54.522 --> 01:39:59.661
because when I heard someone
laugh,

01:39:59.761 --> 01:40:02.930
I always thought it was
directed to me.

01:40:03.031 --> 01:40:06.134
*

01:40:06.234 --> 01:40:11.873
But now I've reached a point
where I've embraced the past.

01:40:14.909 --> 01:40:19.047
I'm proud of being
Milli Vanilli.

01:40:19.147 --> 01:40:21.783
I'm proud of being who I am.

01:40:23.118 --> 01:40:29.524

01:41:04.626 --> 01:41:06.561
When people think of
Milli Vanilli...

01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:07.995
* You can blame it
on the rain *

01:41:08.096 --> 01:41:10.798
The one thing I want people
to think of is that

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:11.733
when you fall...

01:41:11.833 --> 01:41:13.335
* And the rain don't care

01:41:13.435 --> 01:41:14.736
You can stand back up.

I am honoring his name
every time I perform onstage.

* Whatever you do,
don't put the blame on you *

01:41:32.787 --> 01:41:36.124
You fall, you stand back up,
and you reinvent yourself.

01:41:36.224 --> 01:41:40.562
* Yeah, yeah

01:41:40.662 --> 01:41:42.997
That's the legacy.
