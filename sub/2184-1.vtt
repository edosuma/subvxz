00:45.980 --> 00:51.370
LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.

01:28.150 --> 01:31.450
THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE
ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.

01:31.570 --> 01:35.280
THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND
HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,

01:35.410 --> 01:38.910
BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT
BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.750
IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE,
IN OUR PRESENT.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.880
TONIGHT...

03:45.460 --> 03:49.960
LOS ANGELES 1984
1:52a.m.

03:58.220 --> 04:02.180
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

04:17.360 --> 04:19.700
What the hell...?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.000
Hey, my turn.

05:23.260 --> 05:26.970
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

05:34.940 --> 05:36.980
Nice night for a walk?

05:41.780 --> 05:44.120
Nice night for a walk.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.250
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

05:48.370 --> 05:50.210
Nothing clean. Right.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.420
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

05:53.540 --> 05:56.750
Your clothes, give them to me.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.800
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.

07:43.490 --> 07:47.610
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

07:50.240 --> 07:52.950
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.580
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it! Go.

07:57.830 --> 08:00.750
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

08:44.710 --> 08:47.760
- What day is it? The date.
- 1 2th May.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.840
- Thursday.
- What year?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.070
He's got my gun. Let's go.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.660
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.290
Hi. I'm late.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.380
So am I.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.260
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

13:02.050 --> 13:05.770
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

13:05.890 --> 13:08.640
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

13:08.770 --> 13:10.850
That's mine, but I didn't order fries.

13:10.980 --> 13:14.320
- Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly-beef?

13:14.440 --> 13:17.320
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:18.820 --> 13:20.860
I'm so sorry.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.990
This isn't real leather, is it?

13:29.080 --> 13:32.380
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

13:34.550 --> 13:38.260
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

13:45.600 --> 13:48.060
The 1 2-gauge auto-loader.

13:49.980 --> 13:54.110
That's ltalian. You can go pump or auto.

13:54.820 --> 13:57.690
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.280
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

14:01.990 --> 14:05.660
The beam comes on - you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.830
You can't miss.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.380
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.210
Hey, just what you see, pal.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.920
The Uzi nine millimetre.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.510
You know your weapons, buddy.

14:21.630 --> 14:24.930
Any one of these is ideal
for home defence.

14:25.050 --> 14:27.970
So which will it be?

14:28.100 --> 14:31.690
- All.
- I may close early today.

14:31.810 --> 14:36.110
It's a 1 5-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

14:37.190 --> 14:39.280
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.970
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

15:09.100 --> 15:13.310
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.730
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

15:17.360 --> 15:21.690
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.120
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.350
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

16:32.470 --> 16:36.190
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

16:38.310 --> 16:42.860
Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
You're going to love this.

16:43.730 --> 16:46.860
- What?
- ..compiled from several witnesses.

16:46.990 --> 16:50.280
Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother oftwo,

16:50.410 --> 16:52.830
brutally shot to death this afternoon.

16:52.950 --> 16:55.200
You're dead, honey.

20:08.060 --> 20:10.190
..if you're into sound,

20:10.320 --> 20:14.650
for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.910
We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.

20:19.030 --> 20:22.410
We've got graphic equalisers
and sound balancers that...

20:45.770 --> 20:47.560
Sorry.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.200
Hello?

21:01.330 --> 21:05.540
First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,

21:05.660 --> 21:10.000
then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

21:10.130 --> 21:15.510
And then slowly... slowly pull
yourjeans offinch by inch.

21:17.220 --> 21:18.840
Ginger, it's Matt.

21:18.970 --> 21:23.100
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

21:23.220 --> 21:26.480
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.100
Who is this?

21:29.230 --> 21:31.400
God. Sarah?

21:32.940 --> 21:35.530
Jesus. I'm sorry.

21:35.650 --> 21:38.280
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.860
Sure.

21:42.490 --> 21:44.540
It's the creep.

21:45.870 --> 21:46.870
Hello?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.500
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

21:52.250 --> 21:57.420
You fucking pigs. Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.390
Ed.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.850
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

22:04.970 --> 22:08.600
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

22:08.730 --> 22:12.440
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.610
You know, these work.

22:15.940 --> 22:18.570
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

22:18.690 --> 22:21.990
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

22:23.070 --> 22:25.950
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

22:26.080 --> 22:28.450
Look at the name, Ed.

22:28.580 --> 22:32.290
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

22:34.080 --> 22:35.290
You're kidding.

22:35.420 --> 22:38.050
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

22:38.170 --> 22:42.550
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.970
So...

22:50.310 --> 22:52.850
Better than mortal man deserves.

22:59.990 --> 23:04.320
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

23:04.450 --> 23:06.830
I thought you did.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.080
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

23:15.210 --> 23:17.460
You mind your mother.

23:21.260 --> 23:24.720
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.600
Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out ofit.

23:28.720 --> 23:33.440
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so. Bye.

23:35.190 --> 23:38.270
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

23:38.400 --> 23:43.070
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.240
I'll live.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.620
I'll break his kneecaps.

23:48.240 --> 23:52.120
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

23:53.580 --> 23:55.790
God. It's disgusting.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.710
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.720
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

24:08.010 --> 24:10.060
Damn it, Matt.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.740
Shit.

25:08.860 --> 25:12.990
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.460
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

25:28.630 --> 25:31.090
That coffee's two hours cold.

25:32.050 --> 25:34.600
I put a cigarette out in it.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.230
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

25:38.350 --> 25:40.900
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

25:41.020 --> 25:43.360
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.360
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

25:46.490 --> 25:48.530
Give me a cigarette.

25:58.500 --> 26:03.460
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

26:03.590 --> 26:07.670
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

26:13.470 --> 26:15.510
Same shit.

26:16.430 --> 26:20.270
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

26:20.390 --> 26:25.610
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.820
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.950
Maybe make these jackals work for us.

26:32.070 --> 26:36.870
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.620
Well, how do I look?

26:39.750 --> 26:43.080
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

26:44.250 --> 26:47.380
This just in. Police have announced
the name ofthe victim

26:47.500 --> 26:51.010
in the second oftwo murders
which took place today.

26:51.130 --> 26:55.550
Incredibly, the names ofthe
two victims are virtually identical.

26:55.680 --> 27:00.850
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...

27:00.980 --> 27:03.230
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...

27:03.350 --> 27:05.860
Don't touch it.

27:06.980 --> 27:11.450
Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths

27:11.570 --> 27:15.870
and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.

27:15.990 --> 27:19.790
We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.750
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.340
Hey. Four-fifty.

29:34.510 --> 29:37.800
You have reached the Los Angeles
Police emergency number.

29:37.930 --> 29:42.680
All lines are busy. Ifyou need a police car
sent out to you, stay on the line.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.040
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

31:05.890 --> 31:08.970
Don't make me bust you up, man.

32:08.200 --> 32:12.040
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.120
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

32:15.250 --> 32:19.340
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

32:19.460 --> 32:22.010
Wait for the beep.

32:22.130 --> 32:24.470
This is Sarah. Pick up ifyou're there.

32:24.590 --> 32:30.390
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.

32:30.510 --> 32:35.560
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

32:35.690 --> 32:39.270
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.780
The police keep transferring me.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

32:42.900 --> 32:49.200
The number here is 555 9175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

33:06.510 --> 33:07.510
It's her.

33:08.890 --> 33:11.140
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

33:11.260 --> 33:14.600
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.

33:14.730 --> 33:16.980
I won't. Can you tell me where you are?

33:17.100 --> 33:21.060
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- I know it. It's on Pico.

33:21.190 --> 33:23.900
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

33:23.980 --> 33:28.110
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

33:28.240 --> 33:33.040
You're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible. Don't go outside.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.250
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.

34:00.190 --> 34:02.230
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

36:42.060 --> 36:45.350
Come with me if you wanna live.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.490
Come on!

38:07.180 --> 38:09.900
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

38:10.020 --> 38:14.360
Suspect vehicle - Iate model
grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.650
He's really moving - punching lights.

38:16.780 --> 38:21.530
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.910
Hold it.

38:40.220 --> 38:42.510
Hold on.

38:53.190 --> 38:57.230
Are you injured? Are you shot?

39:02.360 --> 39:05.870
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

39:05.990 --> 39:09.500
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

39:09.620 --> 39:11.920
Do you understand?

39:12.040 --> 39:16.590
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Please don't hurt me.

39:33.770 --> 39:35.610
I'm here to help you.

39:35.730 --> 39:40.400
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

39:40.530 --> 39:42.860
You've been targeted for termination.

39:52.290 --> 39:57.250
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic. Approaching Overland.

40:01.340 --> 40:04.840
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

40:04.970 --> 40:08.680
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

40:08.810 --> 40:12.310
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

40:12.430 --> 40:15.350
It's not a man. A machine.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.980
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101 .

40:27.120 --> 40:31.160
A machine? Like a robot?

40:31.290 --> 40:35.830
Not a robot. A cyborg -
cybernetic organism.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.790
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.630
Get your head down.

41:28.260 --> 41:33.140
Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration
unit. Part man, part machine.

41:33.850 --> 41:38.190
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

41:38.310 --> 41:42.780
Fully armoured, very tough.
Outside it's living human tissue.

41:42.900 --> 41:47.240
Flesh, skin, hair, blood -
grown for the cyborgs.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.200
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.790
I gotta ditch this car.

41:56.960 --> 42:01.080
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

42:01.210 --> 42:03.710
But these are new. They look human.

42:03.840 --> 42:07.670
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.390
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

42:11.510 --> 42:17.180
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

42:17.310 --> 42:21.230
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

42:23.650 --> 42:25.900
Are you saying it's from the future?

42:26.030 --> 42:29.740
One possible future...
from your point of view.

42:29.860 --> 42:32.990
I don't know tech stuff.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.870
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

42:35.990 --> 42:38.040
- Right.
- Right.

42:46.210 --> 42:51.590
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

42:51.720 --> 42:55.720
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

42:55.850 --> 42:58.310
That Terminator is out there.

42:59.560 --> 43:03.360
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

43:03.980 --> 43:08.190
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

43:08.320 --> 43:14.280
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

43:24.380 --> 43:27.250
Can you stop it?

43:30.510 --> 43:32.550
I don't know.

43:33.550 --> 43:36.010
With these weapons, I don't know.

43:52.490 --> 43:56.950
All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...

44:40.370 --> 44:44.920
Reese, why me?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.710
Why does it want me?

44:55.130 --> 44:57.680
There was a nuclear war.

44:59.260 --> 45:01.520
A few years from now,

45:03.640 --> 45:09.270
all this, this whole place, everything,

45:09.400 --> 45:13.990
it's gone, just gone.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.820
There were survivors.

45:16.950 --> 45:18.990
Here, there.

45:21.660 --> 45:24.750
Nobody even knew who started it.

45:26.920 --> 45:31.710
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

45:31.840 --> 45:34.380
Defence network computers.

45:35.130 --> 45:38.220
New, powerful,

45:39.390 --> 45:44.140
hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

45:44.270 --> 45:48.810
They say it got smart -
a new order of intelligence.

45:50.480 --> 45:55.650
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

45:55.780 --> 45:58.660
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.200
Extermination.

46:16.380 --> 46:18.630
Did you see this war?

46:30.350 --> 46:35.190
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

46:35.320 --> 46:38.400
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

46:38.530 --> 46:41.410
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

46:41.530 --> 46:45.450
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

46:45.580 --> 46:50.210
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

46:51.580 --> 46:54.210
This was burned in by laser scanner.

46:58.090 --> 47:02.220
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

47:03.430 --> 47:05.970
Loading bodies.

47:06.100 --> 47:08.810
The disposal units ran night and day.

47:08.890 --> 47:11.980
We were that close to going out for ever.

47:15.230 --> 47:18.740
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

47:18.860 --> 47:20.900
To storm the wire of the camps.

47:21.030 --> 47:24.620
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

47:25.870 --> 47:28.870
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.330
His name was Connor. John Connor.

47:33.460 --> 47:38.090
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

49:27.910 --> 49:29.620
Drive.

49:35.910 --> 49:38.630
Reese!

49:56.810 --> 50:00.270
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

50:00.400 --> 50:04.190
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

50:06.650 --> 50:09.110
Get out of the car.

50:11.580 --> 50:13.620
Drop to your knees.

50:13.740 --> 50:17.040
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

50:45.400 --> 50:49.740
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

50:52.490 --> 50:54.540
Listen, are you sure it's them?

50:54.660 --> 50:57.660
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

50:57.790 --> 51:02.000
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

51:04.590 --> 51:09.170
Ginger. Kiddo.

51:09.680 --> 51:14.930
- Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

51:15.060 --> 51:19.100
Tell him everything Reese told you,
Sarah. Do you feel up to that?

51:19.230 --> 51:21.270
Yeah, I guess so.

51:23.110 --> 51:27.070
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

51:27.190 --> 51:31.990
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

52:56.490 --> 53:00.200
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

53:01.370 --> 53:06.920
With the 1 32nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.840
That's the year 2027?

53:09.960 --> 53:12.010
That's right. Then I was assigned...

53:12.130 --> 53:15.930
- This is fucking great.
- ..under John Connor.

53:16.050 --> 53:19.140
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...

53:19.260 --> 53:21.560
Goddamn! Sorry.

53:21.680 --> 53:25.190
..built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

53:25.310 --> 53:27.350
I see.

53:27.480 --> 53:33.280
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

53:33.400 --> 53:36.700
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

53:36.820 --> 53:39.070
A sort of retroactive abortion?

53:40.580 --> 53:44.080
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.290
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

53:46.420 --> 53:49.130
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

53:49.210 --> 53:51.750
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

53:51.880 --> 53:56.340
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.

53:56.470 --> 54:00.850
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

54:00.970 --> 54:03.890
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

54:04.020 --> 54:08.810
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

54:08.940 --> 54:11.400
The time displacement equipment?

54:11.520 --> 54:15.360
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

54:15.490 --> 54:18.530
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

54:18.660 --> 54:21.370
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

54:21.450 --> 54:23.490
I can't.

54:24.580 --> 54:29.750
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.420
It's just him and me.

56:18.820 --> 56:21.360
It's just him and me.

56:24.410 --> 56:29.540
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.

56:29.660 --> 56:32.540
Don't you have ray guns?

56:32.660 --> 56:36.210
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

56:36.340 --> 56:41.010
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

56:41.130 --> 56:44.840
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.

56:44.970 --> 56:49.470
OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ?

56:49.600 --> 56:53.100
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

56:53.230 --> 56:56.060
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

56:56.190 --> 56:59.150
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

56:59.270 --> 57:03.900
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

57:04.910 --> 57:08.740
- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.

57:08.870 --> 57:11.580
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

57:11.660 --> 57:15.370
Her full name, where she lived.
Theyjust knew the city.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.380
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

57:18.500 --> 57:21.300
- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

57:21.420 --> 57:24.760
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.

57:24.880 --> 57:28.720
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

57:28.850 --> 57:30.890
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...

57:31.010 --> 57:33.060
Shut up!

57:33.180 --> 57:35.890
You still don't get it, do you?

57:35.980 --> 57:41.230
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.

57:41.360 --> 57:46.950
You can't stop him. He'll reach down
her throat and pull her fucking heart out!

57:47.070 --> 57:49.580
- Doc.
- Let go ofme!

57:53.870 --> 57:55.910
Sorry.

57:59.710 --> 58:01.340
He's crazy?

58:01.460 --> 58:04.880
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

58:05.590 --> 58:10.970
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.

58:11.100 --> 58:13.350
It'll stop a 1 2-gauge round.

58:13.470 --> 58:17.730
This other man must've been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that.

58:19.610 --> 58:23.530
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

58:23.650 --> 58:26.360
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.

58:26.490 --> 58:28.950
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

58:29.070 --> 58:31.120
Thank you.

58:31.240 --> 58:34.830
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

58:34.950 --> 58:37.500
Be at least an hour
before your mother gets here.

58:37.620 --> 58:40.790
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

58:40.920 --> 58:45.050
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

58:46.380 --> 58:50.510
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.640
Thank you.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.480
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:15.950 --> 59:19.620
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

59:19.750 --> 59:22.290
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

59:22.420 --> 59:24.040
Where is she?

59:24.170 --> 59:28.920
It make take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.480
I'll be back.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:38.120
Stay here.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.450
Watch him.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:28.520
Ed...

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.510
Sarah!

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:01.640
Reese.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:06.180
This way.

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:49.390
KFLB news time. 4.36.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.810
Top story - the largest single
law enforcement mobilisation

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.020
in California history
is currently underway.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:04:00.030
Police in five counties are engaged
in a massive manhunt for...

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:05.530
Take this.

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:10.660
All right. Let's get this off the road.

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:44.820
- You cold?
- Freezing.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:00.670
Reese?

01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:04.050
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:09.770
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.600
White light.

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:18.860
Pain.

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:25.660
- It's like being born maybe.
- My God.

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.580
I caught one back there.

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:32.830
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:37.380
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:42.420
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:56.230
Jesus.

01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:58.940
See? It passed right through the meat.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.480
This is gonna make me puke.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:04.780
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:09.450
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.330
He's about my height.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.790
He has your eyes.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.920
What's he like?

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:26.760
You trust him. He's got a strength.

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.550
I'd die for John Connor.

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:36.940
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.860
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.860
John never said much about him.

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:49.070
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:53.240
I don't wanna know.

01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:56.750
So was it John that sent you here?

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.580
I volunteered.

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:04.510
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:11.470
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organise,

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.760
prepare from when he was a kid.

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:17.600
When you were in hiding before the war.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.480
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:26.150
It's driving me crazy.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:31.910
Are you sure you have the right person?

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:34.200
I'm sure.

01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:38.250
Come on! Do I look like
the mother of the future?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:45.000
I mean, am I tough? Organised?
I can't even balance my chequebook.

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:52.050
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honour and I don't want it.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.510
Any of it.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.810
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorise it.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.020
Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:09.820
I can't help you with what you must
soon face. The future is not set.

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:12.490
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:15.950
You must survive or I will never exist.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.120
That's all.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.750
It's a good field dressing.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.920
You like it?

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.300
It's my first.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.550
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.560
OK.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.649
Talk to me some more.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:58.080
About what?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.910
Tell me about where you're from.

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.920
All right.

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:10.840
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.140
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:22.430
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:26.020
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.819
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:44.790
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north ofyour position.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.380
Let's go.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.050
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:13.980
Terminator!

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.640
I was dreaming about dogs.

01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:36.860
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:40.860
Your world is pretty terrifying.

01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:22.690
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.120
Fuck you, asshole.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.930
God damn.

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:55.430
Thank you.

01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:02.900
Is this enough?

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:07.150
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:14.450
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.710
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.390
I am dying for a shower.

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.900
We should check your bandage, too.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.570
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:50.490
Keep this.

01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:18.980
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.190
I need to know where to reach you.

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:26.530
You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:28.900
I am worried sick here.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:33.570
OK. OK, here's the number.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.990
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:42.670
It's 408 555 1439. Room nine.

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.670
- Got it?
- I've got it.

01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:49.170
I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.340
I love you, Mom.

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:57.180
I love you, too, sweetheart.

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:11.650
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.370
What have we got?

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.130
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:28.500
What's for dinner?

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:31.800
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.970
What is it?

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:37.680
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:40.680
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:54.400
Make sure there's none on the threads.

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:57.950
Like this.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.660
Screw the end cap on.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.420
Very gently.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.920
You must've had a fun childhood.

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:15.340
That's good.

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:20.430
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:33.030
He'll find us, won't he?

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.320
Probably.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.430
It'll never be over, will it?

01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:07.600
Look at me. I'm shaking.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:13.820
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.570
No, I'm not.

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:31.710
Kyle, the women in your time,

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.130
what are they like?

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:39.090
Good fighters.

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:41.930
That's not what I meant.

01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:45.930
Was there someone special?

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:49.230
Someone...?

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:51.610
A girl, you know.

01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:55.150
No.

01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:59.530
Never.

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:02.660
Never?

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.500
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:15.710
So much pain.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.340
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:24.810
So you feel nothing?

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.060
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:36.820
I didn't know why at the time.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:42.950
It was very old, torn, faded.

01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:53.130
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:58.380
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

01:20:58.510 --> 01:21:02.010
I memorised every line,

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:04.180
every curve.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.390
I came across time for you, Sarah.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.730
I love you. I always have.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.080
I shouldn't have said that.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:09.090
Think fast.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.640
Trade places.

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:53.620
Faster. Drive faster.

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:46.420
Kyle. Oh, my God.

01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:56.490
You stay here.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.350
Let's get outta here.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.390
Get out.

01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:45.450
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.630
Come on.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.590
Help me. Get out. Get out.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:27.250
Don't stop. Run.

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.710
Sarah.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.670
Kyle.

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.190
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:17.000
No.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.230
Wait.

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:23.190
What are you doing?

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.650
Cover, so he can't track us.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.620
Come on.

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:43.130
No. Kyle. Come on.

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.090
- Come on.
- Leave me here.

01:32:56.810 --> 01:33:01.440
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:05.020
On your feet. Move it.

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.140
Get back. Go back.

01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:55.380
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:57.260
Run.

01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:02.350
Run.

01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:05.100
Come on, motherfucker.

01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:59.380
No.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.300
You're terminated, fucker.

01:39:57.690 --> 01:39:59.730
Kyle.

01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:23.750
Seven. November 10. Where was l?

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.760
What's difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:33.600
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.690
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.680
Fill her up.

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.730
Should I tell you about your father?

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:25.110
Boy, that's a tough one.

01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:32.280
Will it effect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.120
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.330
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.460
I suppose I will tell you.

01:41:46.590 --> 01:41:48.840
I owe him that.

01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:53.470
Maybe it'll help if...

01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:58.770
you know that in the few hours
that we had together,

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.270
we loved a lifetime's worth.

01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:19.620
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:22.830
He is ashamed to ask you
for five dollars for this picture.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.290
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:29.420
Pretty good hustle, kid.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.770
What did he just say?

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.980
He said there's a storm coming in.

01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:56.530
I know.
