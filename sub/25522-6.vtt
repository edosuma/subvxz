01:27.713 --> 01:29.297
Amma!

02:00.913 --> 02:02.163
Bless you

02:03.832 --> 02:05.625
for finding her.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.881
I never loved you.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.797
Good morning.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.508
Good morning.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.510
You want a cup of coffee?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.804
I got French vanilla
in a vacuum-sealed pouch.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.180
No, thank you.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.932
I should probably get going.
I got a busy day.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.478
What about tonight?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.315
Well, I have plans.

03:12.234 --> 03:16.821
Unless you feel like joining a bunch
of ex-high school cheerleaders.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.406
You could see
what I might've been like

03:18.490 --> 03:19.740
if I'd have stayed in Wind Gap.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.367
You slept in your clothes?

03:24.037 --> 03:27.248
If you want, I'm the proud owner
of a 14-year-old flannel.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.419
Sounds like you're halfway
to a question you wanted to ask me.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.713
No, it was an offer.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.435
You're gonna have to do better

03:47.519 --> 03:49.687
than a cup of coffee
and an old flannel shirt.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.348
- Be safe out there today.
- Chief...

04:58.298 --> 04:59.382
What is it?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.054
Don't do a thing till I get there.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.766
Have you seen Alan?

05:08.850 --> 05:10.893
No. Why, do you need a ride?

05:10.978 --> 05:14.522
No. Thank you, I'm just...
A quick trip to the pharmacy.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.816
I don't mind.
I gotta pick up some cream anyway.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.903
-For your scars?
-For my hands.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.573
I can pick that up for you.
Finish your breakfast.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.284
This is the first time I've seen
you eat since you got here.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.290
What?

05:35.544 --> 05:36.961
You tell me.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.761
Alan?

05:54.646 --> 05:57.481
-What do you think?
-Millie, you're beautiful.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.068
Mama, couldn't you just
take a bite out of her?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.405
Like a plump, juicy cherry.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.832
Thank you.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.429
-Where you going?
-Just to hang out.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.933
Well, not that I'm the best
to give advice on getting loaded,

06:33.018 --> 06:35.102
but after yesterday,
you should slow down.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.397
I'll be fine.
It's just a few scratches.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.818
You should really put something
on those cuts.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.654
Look.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.951
Check this. If I connect these two,
I could make a "C" for "Camille."

06:53.038 --> 06:54.080
That's not funny.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.875
I wasn't serious.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.210
Okay, well, just
don't ever do anything

06:59.294 --> 07:02.296
-like that, all right?
-Yes. I won't.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.464
Okay.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.509
Thank you,
for coming for me last night.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.805
I get funny ideas sometimes.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.328
Paying your respects?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.498
That's good of you.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.169
It offsets the bad I do.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.091
It's a losing battle,
but it helps me sleep.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.762
I think a young girl prefers daisies.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.182
Adora's always roses, roses, roses.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.185
But these look like

07:59.312 --> 08:01.063
what a child draws.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.983
-It's sweet.
-Yeah.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.654
Can I ask you something?

08:08.738 --> 08:12.283
Adora mentioned that Camille
had some sort of episode recently.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.743
Well, that's interesting.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.039
I'm not one to talk
about people's touchy areas.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.626
Not when I'm sober, anyway.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.423
You're getting warmer, Detective.

08:28.049 --> 08:31.427
And not just 'cause it's hotter
than a whore in church today.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.864
- KCPD.
- Hey, it's Willis.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.951
I need to run a 522.
Admittance records, area hospitals.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.786
Okay, what's the name?

08:58.455 --> 08:59.705
Camille Preaker.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.001
I gotta call you back.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.295
Chief.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.507
I'm on my way.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.618
Thank you.

09:40.664 --> 09:41.872
Who found it?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.333
My workers.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.461
Bob, I'm so sorry
they dragged you down here.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.131
- I'm sorry.
- Is it Ann's?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.551
Might be. I don't know.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.844
Let's hose it down.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.013
No, we still might
be able to pull a print off it.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.349
Bob, you think you could
identify it by the seat?

10:02.310 --> 10:04.228
It was white, with flowers on it.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.437
Here you go.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.879
I'm sorry, Bob.
I'm so sorry.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.340
I'm so sorry.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.844
We're gonna need
the employment records

10:36.928 --> 10:39.722
of everyone who's worked here
for the last five years.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.577
Why don't you come rub me down?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.916
Where's Ashley?

11:08.877 --> 11:10.336
Cheerleading practice.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.839
What time does she get home?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.051
Why?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.013
'Cause there's you, me
and an empty carriage house.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.289
Who do I remind you of?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.043
A bad little girl who thinks
she's a lot cuter than she is.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.962
Then you should
stop watching me.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.923
You know how Ashley gets
when she's jealous.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.966
I like to keep on you, Amma.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.219
Just know I always got an eye on you.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.637
You sure do, now.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.432
It'll be your day. Soon.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.187
Hi.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.692
- Is everything okay?
- Not really.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.779
My mama says you take your problems
with you wherever you go.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.114
Sounds about right.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.784
There are places you can go
for help. You know that, right?

12:23.868 --> 12:27.037
Maybe the voices in your head
can talk to somebody.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.374
We don't want more little girls
showing up without their teeth.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.917
Amma.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.752
I am so rude.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.630
-Have you been waiting long?
-No.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.590
Good. Good.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.758
Hi, girls!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.177
Jodes, Mama wants you to call her.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.221
Would you go get us
some lemonade, please?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.057
John.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.646
Come in.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.190
I'm so sorry about the mess.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.540
You could've been
a model, you know?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.709
-I highly doubt that.
-No, you could have.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.837
I always wanted to be like you
when I was growing up.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.172
You're a legend around here.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.633
There are far better women
to aspire to.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.885
Not in Wind Gap, there aren't.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.679
I used to think about you.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.931
I pictured you in a big mansion

13:28.016 --> 13:31.477
with a few curly tops
and a big investment banker husband.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.645
That sounds nice.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.355
So, what can you tell me
about the girls?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.275
Straight to business?

13:38.735 --> 13:39.860
Yeah.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.820
Okay.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.910
They were darling little girls.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.332
Very well-behaved.
Sweet little things.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.920
It's like God plucked
the very best girls from Wind Gap

13:59.130 --> 14:00.881
to take to heaven for his own.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.258
Hey, why'd you do that?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.552
Because you were just wasting my time.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.762
No, I...

14:07.597 --> 14:08.722
Okay.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.892
I was just trying to protect John.
He's already been hurt enough.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.727
Why does he need your protection?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.479
Do you think he did it?

14:15.563 --> 14:18.982
No. Of course not.
He would never do something like that.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.026
What makes you say that?

14:25.073 --> 14:26.406
Because it would make him popular.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.828
Thank you, John.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.922
Do you ever miss cheerleading?

14:42.924 --> 14:44.258
Shit.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.889
- Cramps.
- That time of the month?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.140
My calf, bitch.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.270
Thank you.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.982
When you're done with her,
I'll go next.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.900
Fuck off, Katie.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.323
I'm good, Becca. Thank you.

15:10.702 --> 15:14.204
Whoa. You sure it wasn't
the other cramps?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.008
Hi.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.095
How about homemade sauce
with pasta and red wine?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.638
I mean, it's progress.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.807
You just tell me when.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.976
So, homemade.
Does that mean you're gonna cook?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.562
You bet I will,
in my fancy kitchen.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.773
I mean, that is if you don't mind
having dinner in bed.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.400
Well,
that's very convenient of you.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.278
Guess what we found today.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.280
Thanks to your mom.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.125
Even the lawn
is not safe from her.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.377
Shall I ask her to move it?

16:03.171 --> 16:04.254
Why cause a scene?

16:09.427 --> 16:11.762
I left your hand cream
in the bathroom.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.098
- You got it.
- Of course, I did.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.226
Was that before or after they found
Ann Nash's bike down at the factory?

16:18.603 --> 16:22.022
Well, that was a business matter.
It did not concern you.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.775
The first piece of material evidence
in a double homicide

16:24.859 --> 16:26.401
certainly does concern me.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.778
Now you know about it,

16:27.862 --> 16:30.030
so there's no reason
to be upset with me.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.407
Camille, your mother would like you
to move your car...

16:32.492 --> 16:34.493
Was the first call they made
to the police or you?

16:35.453 --> 16:36.995
I heard that Bob Nash was there.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.580
What was his reaction
when he saw the bike?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.377
Are you interviewing me?

16:44.754 --> 16:46.421
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.131
I'm your mother.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.052
I'm not a source.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.180
I'm sure you found other ways
to get your information.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.772
- Thanks for the hand cream.
- You're welcome.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.528
I believe she's outstayed her welcome.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.699
You've been more than tolerant, dear.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.325
Thank you.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.038
Let her know
how you feel about it, please.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.220
Hi. I have an appointment
with Dr. Hafia.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.433
-What's your name?
-Richard Willis.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.976
Willis?

17:42.103 --> 17:43.770
I'm trying to get a handle on

17:43.855 --> 17:45.772
the personality type
that might come in here.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.316
It might help me get somewhere
on this case I'm investigating.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.861
There isn't any one type
that we see here.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.239
Some of them are suffering
from underlying psychological problems

17:54.323 --> 17:57.200
such as depression,
psychosis, bipolar disorder.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.494
And then a lot of our patients
are just trying to distract

17:59.579 --> 18:02.873
from painful feelings
resulting from trauma or stress.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.499
That's a pretty wide net.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.293
Like I said, nothing typical.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.629
But if a person
was to end up in a place like this,

18:09.714 --> 18:11.673
their behavior would have to be
pretty severe?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.341
Well, people come in here in a crisis.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.261
Our patients can be
impulsive and aggressive,

18:16.637 --> 18:18.180
but they are very rarely violent.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.765
Whatever is going on with them,

18:19.849 --> 18:22.350
they take it out on themselves
more than other people.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.354
Do you ever miss cheerleading?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.064
So, is that why you think that

18:28.149 --> 18:30.025
the killer is doing this,
for popularity?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.944
What other reason is there?

18:41.579 --> 18:44.498
- Hi.
- Cubby! What's the story?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.709
Well, potential break.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.836
They pulled the bicycle
of the first victim

18:49.921 --> 18:51.171
out of a lagoon of pig shit.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.673
Holy fuck!
Were you there?

18:53.925 --> 18:56.092
No. My mother was.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.928
What does the book of journalism say

18:58.054 --> 19:00.680
about using a family member
as a source?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.390
They're called "anonymous sources."

19:02.475 --> 19:06.228
Right.
Why would someone hide the bicycle

19:06.437 --> 19:08.355
in a shallow pool of pig shit,

19:08.439 --> 19:11.107
unless they were stupid
or trying to frame someone?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.943
So you think
it's someone from town.

19:13.027 --> 19:16.571
Maybe. Everybody thinks
that a man is behind this

19:16.656 --> 19:17.989
and no one's looking at the women.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.951
No, 'cause it doesn't fit the profile.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.702
Women don't kill like that,
that violent.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.329
Until they do.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.331
Get it yourself.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.250
Why aren't you in the office?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.460
'Cause the old ball and chain
won't let me.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.628
She's got me tied to the bed.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.173
That's what an animal I am
in the sack.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.052
Hey, honey. How are you?
I'm worried about you.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.180
I'm fine, I’m just
looking forward to coming home.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.849
Which is a weird thing to say
when you're sitting

19:43.933 --> 19:45.392
in the bedroom you grew up in.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.602
It's closing in on you?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.981
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

19:51.482 --> 19:55.485
Well, sometimes the Lord
offers you the very thing you need.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.737
Yeah.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.573
I'm moving the car now.

19:59.824 --> 20:03.159
Camille, that can...
You know, that can wait.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.996
Please, come have a seat.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.087
We haven't talked in a while.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.094
Listen,

20:22.972 --> 20:24.556
you're making your mother ill.

20:25.933 --> 20:30.353
And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
if these conditions don't improve.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.815
I don't understand.
How am I making her ill?

20:35.776 --> 20:38.570
You cannot day after day

20:38.654 --> 20:41.114
churn out the grisly details
of dead children

20:41.198 --> 20:42.324
to the mother of a dead child!

20:42.408 --> 20:43.617
Alan, I have done

20:44.660 --> 20:46.745
nothing of the sort with Adora.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.455
Please, Camille.

20:48.539 --> 20:53.251
I know how jealous you've always been
of anyone else's well-being.

20:54.211 --> 20:58.506
And to think that I used to regret
that we didn't communicate.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.179
That is something Joya would say.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.140
Yeah, you really are
like your grandmother.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.810
She would stand guard over this house
like a witch.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.354
The only time she ever smiled

21:12.438 --> 21:14.481
was when you refused to nurse
from Adora.

21:14.607 --> 21:19.069
Well, it has been really nice, Alan.
Thank you.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.572
Camille,
Adora has had a hard life.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.408
Joya would come into her room
in the middle of the night,

21:25.493 --> 21:26.785
and she would pinch her.

21:27.870 --> 21:31.498
She said that she was worried
that Adora would die in her sleep.

21:31.582 --> 21:35.377
You know what I say?
She just liked to hurt people.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.253
Yeah, I think you've made your point.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.964
I just think that
if you knew these things,

21:39.048 --> 21:41.341
it might make you
somewhat kinder to your mother.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.551
Yeah, I'll be leaving
as soon as I can, all right?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.011
That would be a good idea.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.687
What was that all about?

21:54.230 --> 21:55.897
You know, family.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.484
Look at you.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.403
When you ride with me,
you ride in style.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.659
Smooth.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.619
That's good bourbon,
but the key is in the ice.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.498
Large ice trays, distilled water,
these cubes will change your life.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.083
Not that I'd know 'cause I'm carrying.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.421
That husband of yours has gotta be
missing you something awful.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.256
Nope, no husband.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.133
Well, honey, you just string
that boyfriend of yours on

22:23.217 --> 22:25.635
as long as you can,
and he'll be begging to marry you.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.012
Yeah, no boyfriend either.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.393
You didn't hear this from me,

22:33.477 --> 22:35.478
but Lisa is thinking about
getting separated.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.273
Son of a bitch. Let's go, asshole.

22:38.733 --> 22:39.941
She walked in on her husband

22:40.026 --> 22:42.110
jerking off
on a copy of a credit card bill.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.611
Don't ask me what that's all about.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.822
Gretchen was the one that told me.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.616
Don't believe her
"I'm so sweet" act for a second here.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.619
She's already repeating every word
you say to any bitch who will listen

22:51.704 --> 22:53.079
before you can even
get it out your mouth.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.539
Katie, too.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.460
But I don't need to tell you that.
We've known that bitch our whole life.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.462
Here you go, baby.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.431
God. There's Lisa's husband's car.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.934
Overcompensating for you know what,
if you ask me.

23:20.775 --> 23:23.693
And just think of the house you
would've had if you had stuck around.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.529
Finish that up.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.074
For an expensive house,
she pours cheap liquor.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.577
I'm so glad you're here.

23:33.037 --> 23:36.581
This is gonna be like the old days.
We gonna have us some fun.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.384
I waited for you.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.638
I'm here now.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.809
I wanna go.

23:59.522 --> 24:03.108
I don't want them to see me here.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.403
Are you sure? Are you really sure?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.216
-Hey.
-Get a Jim Beam, please.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.179
What's this I hear
about you and Ms. Preaker?

24:34.390 --> 24:37.809
This town. Don't you people
have anything better to do?

24:40.062 --> 24:41.104
No.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.192
Don't believe everything you hear.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.987
Yeah, well,

24:49.655 --> 24:52.907
you might want to take
your own advice on that one.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.494
Just saying.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.166
This isn't about the movie,
is it, darling?

25:01.750 --> 25:02.834
No.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.544
It's okay, honey.

25:04.628 --> 25:07.172
You can talk to us.
You're amongst friends.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.091
I went back to work.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.302
Good God, sweetie, why?

25:12.678 --> 25:14.929
With Stephie in preschool,

25:15.014 --> 25:16.848
I felt like I wanted to,
like I needed a purpose.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.141
You have a purpose.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.894
Don't let feminism tell you
what to do with your family.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.354
She's right. Feminism means

25:23.439 --> 25:25.607
letting women
make the choices they want.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.612
Dear heart, what is it? What is it?

25:31.238 --> 25:33.448
Jack doesn't want
to have any more kids.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.742
- He says four's enough.
- For him or for you?

25:35.826 --> 25:37.368
I don't know.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.704
This shit happens every week.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.248
You deserve it.
If you want five, you want five.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.250
You're the only one
who has said that to me.

25:44.335 --> 25:45.835
Well, he's not gonna say it.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.503
He's such an asshole.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.840
I had no idea my life was so miserable

25:50.925 --> 25:53.468
until I started coming
to Katie's little get-togethers.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.346
Well, being conflicted
means you can live a shallow life

25:56.430 --> 25:58.598
without copping
to being a shallow person.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.642
Sounds about right.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.395
I guess we are
who we were in high school.

26:05.981 --> 26:10.276
I set the bar low for myself then,
so there's no way to go but up.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.488
Well, I'm glad you two
are having so much fun.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.490
Considering what's going on
in this town.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.450
What's wrong with this world?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.994
Why would somebody hurt little girls?

26:20.704 --> 26:23.915
- Poor things.
- There she goes again. Jesus.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.459
And to take their teeth?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.294
Just plain sick is what it is.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.171
How can you even report
on these things, Camille?

26:30.673 --> 26:31.714
Hey, that's not fair.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.883
Camille doesn't have any children,

26:33.968 --> 26:36.594
and I just don't think
you can feel the pain

26:36.679 --> 26:37.887
the way that we do.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.305
Right.

26:39.598 --> 26:43.142
I feel, for those little girls.
It's terrible.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.310
I don't mean to sound cruel,

26:44.395 --> 26:47.981
but I don't think part of your heart
can ever work if you don't have kids.

26:48.065 --> 26:51.192
I didn't really become a woman
until I felt McKenzie inside of me.

26:51.402 --> 26:55.363
I mean, there's all this talk
of God versus science,

26:55.698 --> 26:57.991
but it seems like with babies,
both sides agree.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.536
The Bible says,
"be fruitful and multiply,"

27:01.620 --> 27:03.246
and then science...

27:04.748 --> 27:09.627
I mean, when it boils down to it,
that's just what women were made for.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.714
Girl power.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.514
-Hi.
-Hey.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.849
Didn't expect to see you here.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.726
I thought this was kind of like
a "girls only" thing.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.269
Yeah, well, Katie
doesn't know I'm here.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.813
Well, I will not tell her.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.440
-Thanks.
-Okay.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.400
Hey, I'm glad...

27:32.526 --> 27:34.527
Let's...

27:36.780 --> 27:39.282
Listen, I'm glad we can have a minute.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.327
I just, I

27:43.537 --> 27:46.039
felt I owe you an apology

27:46.915 --> 27:48.041
for what happened.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.917
What happened?

27:53.505 --> 27:54.964
Well, that day.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.175
In the woods.

28:00.262 --> 28:01.888
And what we did to you.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.057
I have daughters now,

28:04.141 --> 28:06.017
and it makes me sick thinking that...

28:06.101 --> 28:07.602
That a bunch of football players

28:07.686 --> 28:09.687
would pull a train on them
at the end of a big game?

28:09.772 --> 28:11.189
Camille...

28:11.273 --> 28:12.648
As I recall,
you couldn't even get it up,

28:12.733 --> 28:14.067
so unless you're apologizing
for that...

28:14.151 --> 28:15.360
- Hey.
- Come on.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.195
Just forget about it, all right?
I have.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.614
That day, it's haunted me.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.449
Well, looks like we both got fucked.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.379
Perky little titties,
shining in the sun.

28:35.589 --> 28:38.466
-This gun loaded?
-It is.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.717
Look at you.

28:41.845 --> 28:46.432
I have had my hand on your thigh
for the past 15 minutes, Detective.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.185
This isn't turning out
like I was hoping,

28:49.269 --> 28:53.064
so why don't you just get to
what you need to get to, all right?

28:54.024 --> 28:55.400
Camille.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.152
Why was she in rehab?

28:59.613 --> 29:02.824
I know she was hurting herself.
What I'm asking is why?

29:03.033 --> 29:05.785
Well, I don't know.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.331
I'm pretty fond of Camille.

29:12.126 --> 29:13.292
You know?

29:20.634 --> 29:22.260
She's sensitive.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.221
Special. Beautiful girl.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.933
She wasn't the same
after her sister died.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.685
How did she die?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.773
Marian was sickly, a sickly child.

29:37.151 --> 29:39.026
Was there an autopsy?

29:39.778 --> 29:42.780
Adora Crellin was not gonna
let them carve up her little girl.

29:42.865 --> 29:46.868
"Carve up."
That's an interesting choice of words.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.997
You seem to know
a lot more than you're letting on,

29:51.081 --> 29:53.249
so why don't you just tell me
what you know?

29:53.417 --> 29:56.377
I know she checked herself out early
after her roommate killed herself.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.630
Jesus.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.009
Well, that's news to me.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.262
Dead girls everywhere.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.016
How'd she die?

30:11.602 --> 30:13.186
She drank poison.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.318
Are you sure
I can't drive you home?

30:20.402 --> 30:23.279
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'll just walk.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.405
All right.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.367
Why are you being nice to me?

30:28.452 --> 30:29.911
Why wouldn't I be?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.206
We were bitches to you in high school.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.333
Bitches.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.880
-You were better than most.
-Well, that's not saying much.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.466
You were going through a lot.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.551
Lost your sister,

30:46.470 --> 30:48.346
and you took it out on yourself.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.056
Remember

30:50.891 --> 30:54.101
when I was rubbing your leg
and you were bleeding?

30:55.938 --> 30:58.731
Everyone thought you had your period,
but I saw.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.236
On your thigh, the cuts.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.240
It said "cherry."

31:07.991 --> 31:09.325
That made sense.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.621
We were so shiny.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.415
Luscious on the outside.

31:17.668 --> 31:21.212
But on the inside,
there's that dark, hard pit.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.174
Yeah.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.927
Can I quote you on that?

31:40.357 --> 31:41.524
Alan?

31:41.608 --> 31:44.610
I see you didn't take care
of what I asked you to do.

31:44.736 --> 31:49.865
Well, you were always better
at handling the girls, dear.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.775
I can't...
I can't believe she's here.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.033
Come on!

32:33.452 --> 32:35.411
-What if she gets mad?
-She's gonna be fine.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.829
She's gonna be fine.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.997
-Hi!
-Hi!

32:38.081 --> 32:39.665
What is that?

32:39.750 --> 32:42.335
-That's mine.
-What you got there?

32:42.419 --> 32:44.754
-None of your business.
-Look who's here, boys!

32:44.838 --> 32:47.798
- I see that.
- That's my big sis, Camille.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.676
-Hey, Camille!
-That's Nathan. This is Damon.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.887
- We're gonna take you home.
- No.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.138
-Come on.
-Yeah.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.514
-We're gonna take you home.
-Get on in.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.099
-Amma, I'm gonna walk.
-Go on, get in.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.225
-Come on.
-No way.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.561
-The seat's warm.
-We'll drop you off before we go.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.105
- We'll drop you off before we go.
- Sweet!

33:03.190 --> 33:07.068
We're dropping her off
before we go.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.611
Gotcha.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.953
You're like my ma's age, but hot.

33:19.081 --> 33:22.333
Yeah, I doubt that.
How old is your ma?

33:23.043 --> 33:24.794
Like 33, 34.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.840
- And what's her name?
- Casey Rayburn.

33:32.302 --> 33:35.554
-Must be before my time.
-Dude, seriously?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.890
This chick is obviously way too cool

33:37.974 --> 33:39.475
to be hanging out
with your crackwhore mama.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.686
-Fuck you, Damon!
-Hey. Hey.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.938
Well, I think that was
a very nice compliment.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.981
Thank you very much.
That was very sweet of you.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.944
What the fuck's taking so long?
Let's go!

33:51.905 --> 33:53.239
Par-tay, par-tay.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.448
Come on!

33:58.453 --> 34:00.204
Whoo!

34:01.331 --> 34:02.665
Let's get outta here!

34:05.460 --> 34:07.169
You sure you don't
want to come with us?

34:07.254 --> 34:09.755
It'll be fun.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.299
Come on, chiquita.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.803
OxyContin. Makes you feel really good.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.932
I'm sure it does, but doing it
with my kid sister won't, so...

34:20.016 --> 34:22.017
Come on, Mille, just one?

34:22.436 --> 34:27.690
I feel so happy and good right now.

34:27.774 --> 34:30.818
You just... I mean, you just have to.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.241
Come on, do it.

34:37.325 --> 34:39.952
Do it! Do it! Do it!

34:41.204 --> 34:42.872
- Come on!
- Yeah, okay!

34:47.919 --> 34:51.172
Just five minutes.
Then we'll take you home.

34:52.215 --> 34:56.969
I promise. Come on, Camille! Please.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.892
Yeah.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.852
Yeah!

35:09.149 --> 35:10.816
Damon, let's go!

35:39.346 --> 35:43.057
My God, my God, my God.
They came! They totally came!

35:43.141 --> 35:46.352
- Do we say hello?
- Just let J.C. handle it.

35:47.229 --> 35:50.731
Hi! Justine, how are you?
Good to see you.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.362
Hi!

35:56.446 --> 35:58.155
I thought you guys said
you weren't coming.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.406
I thought that was stupid.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.575
Anyone with a brain
knows that John's cool.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.248
And plus, we're not gonna be
fucking outcasts.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.672
Excuse me.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.298
What the fuck are y'all doing here?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.217
I can't believe you're here.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.844
That he showed his face.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.679
God, you're such a little bitch.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.556
You don't know anything,
you druggy fucker.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.057
Hey. Hey, come on.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.479
Hey. Hey. Come on, girls.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.189
It's okay. Just don't talk.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.567
Okay, that's enough. All right?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.486
- Bye, murderer!
- Amma.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.739
Why don't you go drink
a little bit more?

36:40.824 --> 36:41.991
Fuck off.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.202
It's like she goes out of her way
to irritate me.

36:45.287 --> 36:47.204
I don't think you're alone
in that regard.

36:48.498 --> 36:50.583
So,
how's my article coming along?

36:50.667 --> 36:52.585
To be honest,
you didn't really say anything

36:52.669 --> 36:53.878
particularly quote-worthy.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.797
But I already told people
that I'm gonna be in it.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.174
Yeah, well,
I'm on to different stories.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.218
-Okay.
-Like the one about

37:01.303 --> 37:03.095
how someone
took a chunk out of your ear.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.849
-Was it Natalie?
-Who told you about that?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.059
With you withholding
information like that,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.686
that's not gonna help you.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.479
It's just not something
I like to remember.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.441
Let's go.
J.C. doesn't want me here.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.029
If you want to know about Natalie,
you should ask your mom.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.575
Besides, who really cares about
your stupid article, anyway?

37:24.743 --> 37:26.452
Nobody reads the newspaper anymore.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.537
See you later, baby killer.

37:29.873 --> 37:32.583
Fuck y'all! Fuck all y'all!

37:37.547 --> 37:39.673
Get this show on the road?

37:40.592 --> 37:43.177
Come on. VIP room!

37:43.261 --> 37:45.804
Yes! Yes! Yes!

38:00.695 --> 38:02.112
Don't push me, Kelsey.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.409
Sorry.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.707
Have you ever played a game
of Rolling Roulette?

38:13.792 --> 38:15.000
No.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.295
We pass the X around...

38:19.339 --> 38:21.548
-Okay, here.
-Here.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.509
-Jodes.
-Thank you!

38:26.221 --> 38:30.975
...and the tongue it dissolves on last
is the lucky winner.

38:34.270 --> 38:37.815
This is Damon's best shit, though,
so we'll all roll a little.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.951
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.953
Amma! Hey!

39:08.638 --> 39:10.014
Drink lots of water.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.225
Fuck, Amma,
the game barely started.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.895
Camille's my guest and my sister.

39:18.064 --> 39:21.066
Plus, she could use a little sunshine.
She's had a pretty shitty life.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.027
And just so you know,

39:23.111 --> 39:25.279
we have a dead sister,
just like John Keene,

39:25.363 --> 39:27.573
and she's never, ever dealt with it.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.409
Anyway...

39:32.620 --> 39:34.371
Why are you doing this?

39:35.331 --> 39:37.499
You are a Union woman!

40:44.192 --> 40:45.692
Whoo!

41:14.681 --> 41:16.682
I'm coming with you.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.058
I wanna come with you.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.434
Fuck off. All right?

41:24.983 --> 41:26.275
Come on.

41:32.073 --> 41:33.740
These are really beautiful.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.909
I love yellow when I'm stoned.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.805
Mama says I need
to be careful around you.

41:57.974 --> 41:59.016
Are you dangerous?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.166
Let's get out of here.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.669
Let's get out of here.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.881
Let's get out of here.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.342
Let's get out of here.

43:09.128 --> 43:10.921
-Kansas City.
-Chief.

43:12.423 --> 43:14.633
Breakfast for dinner.

43:15.218 --> 43:18.095
- Thank you, Jessie.
- My pleasure.

43:18.763 --> 43:21.181
I gotta say, I really miss seeing you
in that Robert E. Lee getup.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.017
First off, I was Stonewall Jackson.

43:24.227 --> 43:28.188
I'd rather die under friendly fire
than surrender like a coward.

43:29.148 --> 43:32.442
The more I know about you,
the less I want to know.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.529
That's Wind Gap for you.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.864
But you're gonna be
going home tomorrow.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.783
Yeah? Why is that?

43:39.867 --> 43:42.244
Mexican worker at the hog farm
ID'd Keene

43:42.328 --> 43:44.204
as the guy who dumped
the bike in the lagoon.

43:45.415 --> 43:46.873
No shit.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.584
Good shit.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.149
Can't wait to get out of here.

44:14.027 --> 44:15.736
I'm bored all the time.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.489
That's why I act the way I do.

44:20.408 --> 44:22.534
I know I can be a little off.

44:25.288 --> 44:26.788
Did girls like you growing up?

44:27.540 --> 44:30.792
I mean, boys are easy.
You just let them do stuff to you.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.462
You shouldn't let them do that.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.132
When you let them do it to you,

44:39.052 --> 44:40.635
you're really doing it to them.

44:40.970 --> 44:44.181
You have the control
and they like you.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.933
It's not the same with girls.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.853
I mean, I can get them
to do what I want,

44:51.814 --> 44:53.482
but they don't like me.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.320
"It's safer to be feared than loved."

44:59.864 --> 45:01.490
Machiavelli.

45:03.076 --> 45:04.242
How do you know that?

45:05.828 --> 45:07.204
You know how.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.041
Sometimes you need to be mean

45:14.545 --> 45:15.879
or hurt.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.632
Amma, do you cut?

45:24.555 --> 45:27.349
-I'm so happy with you!
-Shh!

45:37.652 --> 45:40.153
You're like my soul mate.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.615
You're like my sister.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.326
I love you.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.870
Take me back to St. Louis with you.

45:48.955 --> 45:52.791
I can get a job after school
at a boutique

45:52.875 --> 45:55.919
or a fancy fabric shop.

45:56.963 --> 45:59.673
You think I could put my dollhouse
on a résumé?

46:19.444 --> 46:21.153
I thought you liked it rough.

46:24.740 --> 46:27.784
-Want to sleep in my room?
-No.

46:30.246 --> 46:33.165
No, I'm dead tired. I think I should
just go to my bed tonight.

46:33.249 --> 46:35.125
Can I sleep over with you?

46:36.836 --> 46:38.587
No, I...

46:40.131 --> 46:41.673
I think we should just
sleep separate tonight,

46:41.757 --> 46:43.675
and then we'll hang out
tomorrow, okay?

46:51.684 --> 46:54.728
Amma. Amma! Fine! Fine!

46:55.354 --> 46:58.064
Fine. You can sleep
in my room. Come on.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.859
You can sleep with me.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.822
Jesus, Amma.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.082
I just can't remember
being this happy.

47:37.146 --> 47:40.690
I wanna bring
my dollhouse upstairs.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.948
I know you think
Adora likes me better,

47:48.032 --> 47:49.407
but that's not true.

47:50.326 --> 47:52.494
She calls out names
when she's sleeping.

47:52.787 --> 47:55.080
Marian, you.

47:59.335 --> 48:01.336
-Here.
-Wait.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.629
Wait.

48:48.217 --> 48:50.051
Do you ever feel like

48:51.887 --> 48:54.264
bad things are gonna happen to you

48:55.516 --> 48:57.267
and you can't stop them?

48:59.687 --> 49:01.605
You can't do anything?

49:04.317 --> 49:06.192
You just have to wait?

49:31.010 --> 49:33.094
It's not safe here for you.
