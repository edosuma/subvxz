WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:01.932
People have a right
to know who's still out there.

00:02.063 --> 00:04.022
Charlie, Luciana, Jacob,
Wes, and Daniel.

00:04.152 --> 00:05.762
We just
found them all.

00:07.808 --> 00:08.722
I need your help, Victor.

00:08.852 --> 00:10.550
Oh, God.

00:12.682 --> 00:14.206
Bring me the baby.

00:14.336 --> 00:16.251
I didn't know
you liked children.

00:16.382 --> 00:19.124
She's got to get used to
her new father sometime.

00:19.254 --> 00:20.342
We can't stay here.

00:20.473 --> 00:22.301
I'd rather face
whatever's out there.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.694
Leaving really isn't
an option.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.261
We found it.

00:26.392 --> 00:28.394
No, that's not PADRE.

00:40.493 --> 00:42.451
Dorie Sr.:
Careful, kid.

00:42.451 --> 00:45.411
Garcia, give me a second,
hmm?

00:48.283 --> 00:50.807
Victor's particular
about those.

00:50.807 --> 00:52.374
Howard sent for me.Mm.

00:52.374 --> 00:54.420
I ran up here
as fast as I could.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.205
Let me, uh, send these boys out
to meet Victor on his scout,

00:57.205 --> 00:59.990
and, uh, see
if I can find Howard.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.253
Maybe he wants me
to join them.

01:01.253 --> 01:03.385
Not today.

01:03.385 --> 01:06.649
Got something else
in mind.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.303
Have a seat.

01:14.396 --> 01:15.876
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.530
What's Victor looking for
out there?

01:17.530 --> 01:21.403
That's between him
and his Rangers.

01:21.403 --> 01:23.884
You'll join them
when you're ready.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.756
And when's that
gonna be?

01:26.756 --> 01:30.238
When Victor says
you are.

01:30.238 --> 01:33.023
I just thought
I'd be closer by now.

01:35.504 --> 01:36.679
How old are you, Ali?

01:36.679 --> 01:37.985
15.

01:37.985 --> 01:39.813
15, huh?

01:39.813 --> 01:41.858
And you really think
you're ready to be a Ranger?

01:41.858 --> 01:43.208
Yes, sir.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.775
I'm ready.

01:45.775 --> 01:48.822
I admire your ambition.

01:48.822 --> 01:51.825
I know Victor does,
too.

01:51.825 --> 01:55.916
But everyone has got
to start somewhere.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.879
To that end.

02:02.879 --> 02:04.098
Another one?

02:04.098 --> 02:06.796
No, this is not just
any butterfly.

02:06.796 --> 02:08.972
This is
the Mourning Cloak.

02:08.972 --> 02:10.017
Extremely rare.

02:10.017 --> 02:11.845
Live for about a year.

02:11.845 --> 02:15.370
And Victor has got the perfect
spot for it on the shelf.

02:15.370 --> 02:18.243
All you've got to do
is find one.

02:20.288 --> 02:21.681
Is there
something wrong?

02:24.249 --> 02:26.468
I just don't know how
collecting these

02:26.468 --> 02:28.514
proves I can be
one of his Rangers.

02:28.514 --> 02:31.734
I hear ya, kid.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.301
I could tell you stories
from when I first got

02:33.301 --> 02:34.781
out of the academy.

02:34.781 --> 02:37.871
What the senior cops
called initiation.

02:37.871 --> 02:39.394
It was no picnic --

02:39.394 --> 02:42.049
Victor asked you
to assist me while he's gone.

02:42.049 --> 02:45.008
Not spook the kid
with your old war stories.

02:45.008 --> 02:47.620
Look,
this isn't hazing, Ali.

02:47.620 --> 02:50.362
It's about how
you see the world.

02:50.362 --> 02:53.147
About who you choose
to be in it.

02:55.367 --> 02:58.108
They all began
as caterpillars.

02:58.108 --> 03:01.068
See, they started
as one thing,

03:01.068 --> 03:04.202
and became something else.

03:04.202 --> 03:05.768
Something better.

03:07.944 --> 03:10.469
And that's what
Victor did.

03:10.469 --> 03:13.211
That's how he survived.

03:13.211 --> 03:15.909
Show Victor what
you're capable of,

03:15.909 --> 03:21.306
that you can be
something greater.

03:21.306 --> 03:24.004
Then you'll be ready.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.907
Gotcha.

04:42.474 --> 04:44.084
Gotcha.

05:15.811 --> 05:17.465
Hands up!

05:20.903 --> 05:22.775
Turn around.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.866
Who the hell are you?

05:45.624 --> 05:47.147
Take your mask off!

05:54.284 --> 05:56.243
You're just a kid.

05:56.243 --> 05:57.636
Yeah, well,
what does that make you?

05:57.636 --> 06:00.900
What were
you stealing?

06:00.900 --> 06:02.858
I got separated from my group,
alright?

06:02.858 --> 06:05.383
I mean, I just looking
for food, water...

06:10.736 --> 06:12.215
You're lucky
this didn't break.

06:12.215 --> 06:14.000
Over here.
I see him.

06:30.059 --> 06:32.366
You weren't back
when we said.

06:32.366 --> 06:33.541
John?

06:33.541 --> 06:35.282
Howdy, Charlie.

06:35.282 --> 06:38.198
You two
know each other?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.069
We did for a spell.

06:40.069 --> 06:42.637
She was with us
when we tried to stop Teddy.

06:42.637 --> 06:43.856
Oh.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.207
You're one of
Morgan's.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.168
Wait, John --

06:52.168 --> 06:53.648
It'll be okay, kid.

06:53.648 --> 06:55.215
Just stay calm.

07:05.138 --> 07:06.618
What's going on?

07:06.618 --> 07:07.749
She's coming with us.

07:07.749 --> 07:09.229
Why?

07:09.229 --> 07:10.578
I told you that you needed
to show Victor

07:10.578 --> 07:13.581
what you're capable of.

07:13.581 --> 07:15.235
You just might
get your shot.

07:42.784 --> 07:44.743
Why were you
stealing from Ali?

07:44.743 --> 07:46.222
Look, I want to talk
to Strand.

07:46.222 --> 07:48.050
'Fraid that's not possible,
kid.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.532
Victor is out ensuring
the safety of this Tower.

07:51.532 --> 07:54.404
He's asked me to do the same
in his absence.

07:54.404 --> 07:56.494
So, I need you to tell me
the truth, Charlie.

07:56.494 --> 07:57.886
It wasn't a coincidence,

07:57.886 --> 08:00.759
you running into Ali
out there, was it?

08:00.759 --> 08:02.021
No.

08:02.021 --> 08:03.457
Did Morgan
put you up to it?

08:03.457 --> 08:05.067
No, he --
he doesn't know I'm here.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.634
Then why are you?

08:09.637 --> 08:11.596
Well, I've been looking
for a way

08:11.596 --> 08:13.554
into this place
for a while now.

08:13.554 --> 08:15.338
I just thought that maybe
one of your people

08:15.338 --> 08:18.341
would have blueprints
or something

08:18.341 --> 08:20.082
I could use
to help me sneak in.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.301
For what purpose?

08:21.301 --> 08:22.694
I want to live here.

08:22.694 --> 08:24.652
Why not just use
the call box?

08:24.652 --> 08:26.480
Because she knew
Victor would say no.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.873
Why?

08:27.873 --> 08:30.440
Because they have
a checkered past.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.051
How do you know that?

08:32.051 --> 08:36.359
I know everything about
Victor's former allies.

08:36.359 --> 08:39.319
Especially the ones
he's deemed as threats.

08:39.319 --> 08:42.104
That's why I was gonna
sneak in.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.063
And do what?

08:44.063 --> 08:45.804
Live between the walls?

08:45.804 --> 08:49.155
Or hope that June
or maybe Grace

08:49.155 --> 08:51.549
would help
keep me a secret.

08:51.549 --> 08:53.115
Look, I knew that it was
the only way

08:53.115 --> 08:54.552
that I could be
a part of this.

08:54.552 --> 08:57.685
This?A chance at a normal life.

08:57.685 --> 09:01.080
Oh.

09:01.080 --> 09:05.301
Yes, well, I can, uh,
certainly understand that.

09:05.301 --> 09:06.912
But why not
come sooner?

09:12.831 --> 09:15.747
On the sub,
the computers --

09:15.747 --> 09:20.012
when the emergency power's on,
you can see what day it is.

09:20.012 --> 09:26.714
So, I looked,
and I'll be 13 this week.

09:30.762 --> 09:32.328
I mean, I was --

09:32.328 --> 09:35.418
I was so young
when everything changed.

09:35.418 --> 09:36.942
And every single day
since then,

09:36.942 --> 09:40.598
it's just been one fight
after another fight

09:40.598 --> 09:44.253
after another fight
after another fight.

09:44.253 --> 09:47.605
I just don't want to fight
anymore.

09:47.605 --> 09:50.477
I just want a normal life,

09:50.477 --> 09:53.915
and I know that this is
where I can do that.

09:53.915 --> 09:57.440
Look, I know that
you don't trust me,

09:57.440 --> 10:00.095
but if you just
give me a chance,

10:00.095 --> 10:01.793
whatever I can do
to prove to you

10:01.793 --> 10:04.230
that I want to be there,
I'll do it.

10:14.806 --> 10:16.938
Yeah?
It's June.

10:16.938 --> 10:19.462
We have a problem
in the infirmary.

10:20.855 --> 10:24.293
Garcia, what happened?
Where's Victor?

10:24.293 --> 10:27.470
He split off
before we got there.

10:27.470 --> 10:28.820
And the other Rangers?

10:28.820 --> 10:30.909
That place was crawling
with dead.

10:31.953 --> 10:34.652
They didn't make it.

10:34.652 --> 10:36.479
Those are
radiation burns.

10:36.479 --> 10:37.655
How do you know that?

10:39.526 --> 10:41.659
We, uh --
We see them a lot out there.

10:47.055 --> 10:49.536
Garcia, did you find
what we asked for?

10:49.536 --> 10:51.538
There were
too many of them.

10:52.931 --> 10:55.498
I just wanted to
protect the Tower.

10:55.498 --> 10:57.675
I'd do anything
for this place.

11:03.855 --> 11:05.204
Keep moving.

11:05.204 --> 11:06.248
Howard wants you
in the holding room

11:06.248 --> 11:08.729
as soon as possible.

11:08.729 --> 11:10.775
So,
how'd you wind up here?

11:10.775 --> 11:12.211
I'm not telling you
anything.

11:12.211 --> 11:14.039
Why not?

11:14.039 --> 11:16.215
It doesn't sound
like Strand trusts you.

11:16.215 --> 11:19.566
And you just do
whatever he says?

11:19.566 --> 11:21.568
Pretty much.
Why?

11:21.568 --> 11:23.265
'Cause that's how
I'm gonna become a Ranger.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.659
So, you're telling me that

11:25.659 --> 11:28.096
you want to go out there,

11:28.096 --> 11:29.968
when you could just
stay in here?

11:29.968 --> 11:31.230
You wouldn't understand.

11:32.797 --> 11:34.929
What the hell
was that?

11:38.280 --> 11:41.283
Garcia jumped?

11:41.283 --> 11:44.286
Triple Lindy
off the ledge.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.592
I don't see him
down there.

11:45.592 --> 11:47.812
He's part of the wall now,
player.

11:47.812 --> 11:49.291
It's what Victor
would have wanted.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.076
What?
For him to kill himself?

11:51.076 --> 11:54.906
Garcia promised he'd do anything
he could to protect this place.

11:54.906 --> 11:57.473
If he couldn't do it
while he was alive, then...

11:57.473 --> 12:00.563
He probably just didn't want
to suffer anymore.

12:00.563 --> 12:02.217
Wait,
what do you mean?

12:02.217 --> 12:05.133
He was sick.
He had radiation poisoning.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.656
I thought
this place was safe.

12:06.656 --> 12:08.310
It is.Then how did that happen?

12:08.310 --> 12:10.356
It just doesn't --It happened out there.

12:10.356 --> 12:11.531
On a scout.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.880
Well, what was he
scouting for?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.403
Parts.

12:14.403 --> 12:17.406
Our elevators haven't worked
since we were attacked.

12:17.406 --> 12:19.539
Victor wants them fixed.

12:22.063 --> 12:24.587
I mean, what if I can
get them for you?

12:24.587 --> 12:25.893
Will you let me
live here?

12:25.893 --> 12:27.155
Charlie, no.
It's too dangerous.

12:27.155 --> 12:29.027
Not necessarily.

12:29.027 --> 12:30.898
Are you kidding me? Look what
happened to the other scouts.

12:30.898 --> 12:32.682
None of them have
Charlie's skills.

12:32.682 --> 12:34.467
Well, what skills
would those be?

12:34.467 --> 12:37.949
Ones that allow her to sneak in
and out of places undetected.

12:37.949 --> 12:41.256
You've done it before.
Victor told me.

12:41.256 --> 12:42.736
Hell, you even said you were
gonna do it again, here.

12:42.736 --> 12:43.824
You can't be serious.

12:43.824 --> 12:45.826
She volunteered.

12:51.919 --> 12:54.443
You really think
you can do this?

12:54.443 --> 12:56.054
Would I get to live
in the Tower?

12:56.054 --> 12:59.579
Well,
that's Victor's call.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.190
But he listens to me.

13:02.190 --> 13:05.063
You do this,
you're in.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.894
I'll do it.

13:13.114 --> 13:14.550
You'll leave tomorrow.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.292
Ali, you'll go with her.I will?

13:17.292 --> 13:20.382
Why don't you, uh, catch Charlie
up on what we're looking for

13:20.382 --> 13:22.994
and then get her down
to one of the guest suites.

13:22.994 --> 13:27.128
She should, uh, get some rest
before tomorrow.

13:27.128 --> 13:29.217
Charlie, come on.
I'll go with you.

13:29.217 --> 13:31.393
'Cause I want to hear
play-by-play about my sister.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.573
Ali, can we talk?

13:40.011 --> 13:43.579
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

13:43.579 --> 13:45.668
What? By -- By dying
like Garcia,

13:45.668 --> 13:46.931
over some elevator parts?

13:46.931 --> 13:49.150
It's not about
the elevator.

13:49.150 --> 13:50.412
Then what's it about?

13:50.412 --> 13:52.458
Finding out why
Charlie's really here.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.939
She said
she came on her own.

13:54.939 --> 13:56.810
That she wants
to live here.

13:56.810 --> 13:58.377
And that very well
might be true,

13:58.377 --> 14:01.119
but we need to consider
the possibility it might not be.

14:03.295 --> 14:04.818
She could die.

14:07.473 --> 14:11.303
If she wants to live here
as much as she says,

14:11.303 --> 14:12.913
she'll be careful.

14:15.785 --> 14:17.439
This feels wrong.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.139
Look, things like this
are never easy.

14:21.139 --> 14:23.271
I get that.

14:23.271 --> 14:25.621
But at the end of the day,

14:25.621 --> 14:27.972
it's what separates
the caterpillars

14:27.972 --> 14:31.236
from the butterflies.

14:31.236 --> 14:33.716
You said you wanted
to be a Ranger.

14:33.716 --> 14:35.283
This is what Rangers do.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.027
Okay.

14:51.169 --> 14:54.824
So, why's Strand got
you out collecting butterflies?

14:54.824 --> 14:57.784
What does it matter?

14:57.784 --> 14:59.177
I just think
it's kinda shitty,

14:59.177 --> 15:01.919
trapping them in those jars
for no reason.

15:01.919 --> 15:03.703
They only live for a year,
tops.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.532
And you think that
makes it okay?

15:06.532 --> 15:08.577
Don't you think that
something like that

15:08.577 --> 15:11.189
should get the chance
to live,

15:11.189 --> 15:13.713
even if it's just
for a little while?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.933
Doesn't matter
what I think.

15:15.933 --> 15:19.110
Just as long as I can
prove myself to him.

15:19.110 --> 15:22.200
Man, what did he ever do
for you?

15:23.505 --> 15:25.464
Stalkers.

15:25.464 --> 15:26.900
If they see us,

15:26.900 --> 15:28.815
they may try to
use us against Strand.

15:38.433 --> 15:40.522
I know a place
to hole up.

15:59.150 --> 16:03.154
So, why's being a Ranger
so important to you, anyway?

16:03.154 --> 16:04.764
Hold on.

16:08.681 --> 16:10.639
It looks clear.

16:10.639 --> 16:14.252
I have always wanted
to play a game.

16:14.252 --> 16:16.906
Play a game?

16:16.906 --> 16:18.082
What?

16:18.082 --> 16:19.692
You've never
bowled before?

16:23.739 --> 16:25.263
Don't move.

16:27.047 --> 16:29.441
Alright, I'll go
check on the other side.

16:33.401 --> 16:35.795
Anybody in there?!

16:38.363 --> 16:40.321
There's only
about three over here.

16:40.321 --> 16:42.932
There's really nothing.

16:48.286 --> 16:49.591
They're gone.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.376
Must have just been
passing through.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.297
How did you know
that gun was here?

16:59.297 --> 17:01.603
I mean, first the key,
and then that...

17:01.603 --> 17:04.476
I used to live nearby.

17:04.476 --> 17:06.782
Come here
on the weekends.

17:06.782 --> 17:08.306
They had
a couple robberies.

17:10.482 --> 17:11.961
Were you any good?

17:11.961 --> 17:13.659
I don't know.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.052
Will you show me
how to play?

17:15.052 --> 17:17.706
You've really never
bowled before?

17:17.706 --> 17:20.057
It can't be that hard,
right?

17:29.283 --> 17:32.765
You gotta
put some spin on it.

17:32.765 --> 17:34.201
Will you show me?
Please?

17:34.201 --> 17:36.073
We really gotta get going.Come on.

17:36.073 --> 17:37.857
It'll only take, like,
five minutes.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.641
I'll show you when we get back
from getting

17:39.641 --> 17:40.903
what Howard wants
for the elevator.

17:40.903 --> 17:42.818
But what if I don't
make it back?

17:42.818 --> 17:44.385
What if you don't?

17:46.648 --> 17:49.347
The other Rangers didn't.

17:49.347 --> 17:51.044
One roll.

17:57.790 --> 17:59.139
Okay.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.969
So, you're gonna want
to bend your knees

18:02.969 --> 18:06.103
and face towards the pins,

18:06.103 --> 18:09.149
and put your fingers inside
the two middle ones,

18:09.149 --> 18:11.151
put your thumb
on the bottom.

18:15.982 --> 18:18.463
Um...and then,
you're gonna wanna --

18:18.463 --> 18:20.378
You see the middle arrow,
right in the center?

18:20.378 --> 18:21.770
Yeah.

18:21.770 --> 18:25.513
That's what you're gonna
want to aim towards.

18:25.513 --> 18:28.603
So, when you're following
through,

18:28.603 --> 18:32.868
just twist your wrist a little
bit to the left, okay?

18:32.868 --> 18:34.218
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

18:34.218 --> 18:35.828
Here we go.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.534
That was good,
right?

18:49.233 --> 18:51.583
We should really
get going.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.733
Ali.

19:17.043 --> 19:19.176
Ali, what is it?

19:19.176 --> 19:20.786
Come on.
Let's go.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.056
Supposed to be
just ahead.

19:30.056 --> 19:33.146
Who's Muhammad?

19:33.146 --> 19:36.932
I saw his name under
that photo of you two.

19:36.932 --> 19:39.935
Were you guys teammates?

19:39.935 --> 19:42.721
He was my dad.

19:42.721 --> 19:46.638
Muhammad and Ali?

19:46.638 --> 19:50.555
Yeah.
He, uh -- He loved boxing.

19:50.555 --> 19:53.253
Uh, was he
in the military?

19:53.253 --> 19:54.994
I saw a rank
by his name.

19:54.994 --> 19:58.127
He was an Imam
in the Army.

19:58.127 --> 20:00.956
What happened to him?

20:00.956 --> 20:03.307
The bomb went off.

20:03.307 --> 20:07.659
All the bad shit that came
with it got into his blood.

20:07.659 --> 20:10.052
He didn't make it.

20:10.052 --> 20:13.055
Were you with him
until the end?

20:16.668 --> 20:18.626
Yeah.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.281
I'm sorry.

20:21.281 --> 20:22.500
We're here.

20:24.676 --> 20:26.243
Guess this is it.

20:32.814 --> 20:36.775
Garcia said there was
a lot of dead inside.

20:36.775 --> 20:39.560
Yeah, most of them are
probably at ground level,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.954
so I'll just start higher.

20:43.999 --> 20:45.218
How you gonna do that?

20:45.218 --> 20:47.351
I can handle it.

20:47.351 --> 20:49.701
I've done this before,
remember?

20:53.357 --> 20:55.359
Wait!

20:55.359 --> 20:56.534
I'm coming with you.

20:56.534 --> 20:58.362
Look,
it's better if I go alone.

21:01.321 --> 21:03.541
What's wrong?

21:03.541 --> 21:04.803
You're really doing
all of this

21:04.803 --> 21:07.240
just so you can live
in the Tower?

21:07.240 --> 21:11.200
Yeah, that and I want to
help you become a Ranger.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.898
Why do you
want to help me?

21:12.898 --> 21:15.466
Well, I wouldn't be getting this
chance if it wasn't for you.

21:20.862 --> 21:24.779
Anything happens,
I'll be on channel 4, okay?

21:24.779 --> 21:26.433
A-And be fast.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.783
You don't want to get exposed
to whatever Garcia was.

21:28.783 --> 21:30.089
I know. I know.

22:06.995 --> 22:09.084
Hands up.

22:17.223 --> 22:18.616
That's all I have.

22:18.616 --> 22:19.878
Clean clothes.

22:19.878 --> 22:22.010
Nice gun.
A horse.

22:22.010 --> 22:23.490
Must be one of Strand's.

22:23.490 --> 22:25.187
You try anything,
he'll kill you.

22:25.187 --> 22:27.886
You want to tell us why he keeps
sending people to the pit?

22:27.886 --> 22:29.104
What's the pit?

22:29.104 --> 22:31.324
Don't play dumb.
I'm not.

22:31.324 --> 22:32.760
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.762
I'm not even a Ranger.What about your friend?

22:34.762 --> 22:35.981
What friend?

22:35.981 --> 22:38.287
The girl
that went inside.

22:38.287 --> 22:41.421
She doesn't know
anything.

22:41.421 --> 22:44.293
What'd she go
in there for?

22:44.293 --> 22:45.817
Let's go find out.

22:45.817 --> 22:48.080
Hey!
We're going in.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.734
Move.

22:53.912 --> 22:55.522
I said move.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.584
Please.
Let me put my mask on.

23:13.584 --> 23:15.150
It's not safe in there.

23:15.150 --> 23:17.718
Open the door.

23:17.718 --> 23:19.851
Now.

23:26.771 --> 23:28.468
Get back!

23:28.468 --> 23:29.904
Back up!

24:02.197 --> 24:04.330
Charlie!

24:04.330 --> 24:06.027
Charlie!

25:11.658 --> 25:13.660
Are you okay?

25:13.660 --> 25:15.880
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

25:17.272 --> 25:19.100
Where's your mask?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.406
I lost it in the fight.

25:20.406 --> 25:22.147
What fight?

25:27.587 --> 25:29.197
You killed all these?

25:29.197 --> 25:30.982
Yeah, I locked the rest
in there.

25:30.982 --> 25:33.114
One of them grabbed onto my mask
while I was closing the door,

25:33.114 --> 25:34.725
and I'm not
going in after it.

25:34.725 --> 25:36.640
Plus,
the readings were clean.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.990
You shouldn't have
gotten close to them.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.557
I was careful.

26:08.672 --> 26:10.282
Just be quick.

26:18.551 --> 26:20.684
Why didn't you
kill that walker?

26:21.902 --> 26:25.036
Is it 'cause it reminded you
of your dad?

26:25.036 --> 26:27.299
I thought maybe the uniform --I had it covered.

26:30.607 --> 26:32.217
I saw
what you did outside.

26:34.436 --> 26:35.786
It was the only way.

26:46.666 --> 26:48.537
I feel terrible.

26:48.537 --> 26:49.713
It's fine.

26:49.713 --> 26:52.367
I handled it.

26:52.367 --> 26:55.849
I don't mean that.

26:55.849 --> 26:57.938
I didn't tell you
the truth.

26:57.938 --> 27:00.027
About what?

27:00.027 --> 27:03.465
About why
I came to the Tower.

27:03.465 --> 27:05.250
Morgan sent me.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.947
To do what?

27:06.947 --> 27:10.124
I'm supposed to turn off
the beacon on the roof tonight.

27:10.124 --> 27:12.083
Why?
To clear out the walkers

27:12.083 --> 27:13.737
so they can get Grace
and the baby out.

27:13.737 --> 27:15.260
And then what?
They attack?

27:15.260 --> 27:17.175
I don't know.

27:17.175 --> 27:18.959
Howard was right
about you.

27:18.959 --> 27:21.092
You made me believe you.
You made me help you.

27:21.092 --> 27:22.223
When Strand finds out
about this --

27:22.223 --> 27:23.703
He won't.
Of course he will!

27:23.703 --> 27:25.096
Because I'm not gonna
go through with it.

27:25.096 --> 27:27.402
Oh, yeah?I'm serious. I won't.

27:27.402 --> 27:29.187
I don't want to do it anymore.Why would I believe you?

27:29.187 --> 27:32.233
Because I didn't lie
about everything.

27:32.233 --> 27:35.236
All of those things
I said I wanted,

27:35.236 --> 27:38.675
a life like
I was supposed to have,

27:38.675 --> 27:41.765
I still want that.

27:41.765 --> 27:43.592
And I thought that I was gonna
find that with Morgan,

27:43.592 --> 27:46.944
but not if I have to put you
in danger to get it.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.560
We don't have much time,
okay?

27:54.560 --> 27:56.431
I'm almost done.

27:56.431 --> 27:59.565
Ali, do you copy?

27:59.565 --> 28:02.263
Yes, Howard.
I copy. I'm here.

28:02.263 --> 28:03.874
What's taking so long?

28:03.874 --> 28:05.353
We're about to head out.

28:05.353 --> 28:07.965
"We"?
Did you find out what I asked?

28:12.447 --> 28:15.015
What's he talking about?

28:15.015 --> 28:16.930
Ali?

28:16.930 --> 28:18.192
Yes.

28:18.192 --> 28:19.846
I did.

28:25.722 --> 28:27.158
I'm sorry.

28:27.158 --> 28:30.161
Wait, Ali --
Ali, what are you doing?

28:30.161 --> 28:31.989
Protecting the Tower.

28:35.427 --> 28:36.994
Ali?

28:36.994 --> 28:38.343
Ali!

28:38.343 --> 28:40.562
Ali, I'll die
if you leave me here!

28:40.562 --> 28:41.955
You've done this before,
right?

28:41.955 --> 28:43.217
You'll be fine.

28:43.217 --> 28:45.002
Ali!

28:45.002 --> 28:47.482
Ali!

28:47.482 --> 28:49.702
Ali,
please don't do this!

28:49.702 --> 28:51.008
Ali,
please just come back!

28:51.008 --> 28:52.966
Please don't do this to me!

28:52.966 --> 28:54.359
Ali!

28:57.754 --> 29:00.800
Ali! Ali, I-I don't understand
why you're doing this.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.411
Just please come back!
I'm gonna die!

29:05.674 --> 29:06.850
Howard, do you copy?

29:06.850 --> 29:08.155
Ali, please!

29:08.155 --> 29:10.244
I'm here, Ali.

29:10.244 --> 29:12.203
Is it done?Ali? Please!

29:12.203 --> 29:14.248
Yeah, I got the board.Ali, please
don't leave me here.

29:14.248 --> 29:15.380
Coming back now.

29:15.380 --> 29:18.209
Ali, please, please!

29:18.209 --> 29:19.558
Just you?

29:19.558 --> 29:23.214
You asked me why
I didn't run away before.

29:23.214 --> 29:26.652
And it's just because that
I didn't want to do it alone.

29:26.652 --> 29:28.262
Just me.

29:28.262 --> 29:29.829
I'm sure you made
the right decision

29:29.829 --> 29:31.918
for the good
of the Tower.

29:31.918 --> 29:34.051
But I don't have to
do it alone anymore.

29:34.051 --> 29:37.184
I don't have to because
we can do it together.

29:37.184 --> 29:40.274
You did what Victor
would've done.

29:40.274 --> 29:42.363
Away from Morgan,
away from Strand.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.757
We -- We don't have to
get stuck in the middle.

29:46.803 --> 29:49.240
Ali, please don't
do this to me!

29:52.199 --> 29:54.593
Ali!

29:54.593 --> 29:55.942
Ali!

30:41.509 --> 30:44.599
I told you I was with my dad
until the end.

30:44.599 --> 30:47.559
That wasn't true.

30:47.559 --> 30:51.955
When he got sick,
I-I left him.

30:51.955 --> 30:54.261
Why?

30:54.261 --> 30:59.266
'Cause I couldn't
handle it.

30:59.266 --> 31:02.661
I couldn't see him
like that.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.362
I was a coward.

31:08.362 --> 31:11.017
Why are you
telling me this?

31:11.017 --> 31:13.715
Because when I thought
about becoming a Ranger,

31:13.715 --> 31:18.198
I thought it would make
everything, you know, okay.

31:18.198 --> 31:22.028
But I was just being
a coward again,

31:22.028 --> 31:24.291
and I'm not gonna make
that same mistake twice.

31:27.207 --> 31:30.558
You said you didn't want
to run away alone.

31:30.558 --> 31:32.169
You don't have to.

31:34.345 --> 31:38.175
What about Strand?
And Howard?

31:38.175 --> 31:40.090
I'm not afraid of them.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.656
Are you?

31:47.880 --> 31:51.057
All those things that
you never got to do --

31:51.057 --> 31:52.711
we can still do them.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.061
Or some of them,
at least.

31:55.061 --> 31:58.151
What about you?

31:58.151 --> 32:01.763
There's still a lot of things
I haven't done, either.

32:01.763 --> 32:03.330
Like what?

32:28.051 --> 32:30.314
Well,
that was a first.

32:30.314 --> 32:32.751
And?

32:32.751 --> 32:34.535
So much better
than bowling.

32:38.148 --> 32:41.281
Alright, well,
let's get out of here.

32:41.281 --> 32:42.717
I found some places
on my patrols

32:42.717 --> 32:44.937
where we can
hole up for a bit,

32:44.937 --> 32:46.417
till we find
something better.

32:51.335 --> 32:54.294
Charlie?

32:54.294 --> 32:56.949
Charlie?

32:56.949 --> 32:58.342
Hey.
It's okay.

32:58.342 --> 32:59.908
It's okay.
I got you.

33:03.390 --> 33:07.394
Mr. Dorie,
do you copy?

33:07.394 --> 33:09.614
Stay with me!
Please!

33:28.111 --> 33:30.504
It's a good thing you called me
when you did.

33:30.504 --> 33:31.810
This is where
she needs to be.

33:39.992 --> 33:41.646
How is she?

33:48.479 --> 33:50.133
Stable.

33:53.571 --> 33:54.876
What's wrong
with her?

33:54.876 --> 33:58.837
She was exposed
to radiation...

33:58.837 --> 34:00.665
just like the Rangers.

34:00.665 --> 34:03.276
No.
That's not possible.

34:03.276 --> 34:06.584
It must've happened
when she was in that building.

34:06.584 --> 34:09.456
We should probably
check you, too.

34:09.456 --> 34:11.937
No. Okay, she told me
she was careful.

34:11.937 --> 34:14.679
Sometimes,
that's not enough.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.681
There are other ways.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.596
Things we can't see.

34:18.596 --> 34:20.206
But you can treat it,
right?

34:22.295 --> 34:23.862
June?

34:25.994 --> 34:27.692
June,
how bad is it?

34:30.651 --> 34:35.091
Given the amount of exposure
she's had,

34:35.091 --> 34:37.005
she should make the most
of every day.

34:39.007 --> 34:40.705
I'm so sorry, Ali.

34:56.286 --> 34:59.593
Hell of a day, Ali.

34:59.593 --> 35:01.117
What are those?

35:01.117 --> 35:03.249
Some of the scouts
just came back with them.

35:05.817 --> 35:07.427
Yeah.

35:10.387 --> 35:13.129
They sort of look like the ones
we saw in that building.

35:16.001 --> 35:18.308
I'll be sure to
mention it to Victor.

35:20.527 --> 35:22.268
Where is he?

35:22.268 --> 35:26.098
He decided to wait till tomorrow
to make the journey back.

35:26.098 --> 35:27.752
Given the state
of the state.

35:33.410 --> 35:38.066
Now, tell me,

35:38.066 --> 35:40.330
why is Charlie here?

35:40.330 --> 35:43.420
What did Morgan
send her here to do?

35:43.420 --> 35:46.727
Morgan didn't send her.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.338
She was telling us
the truth.

35:52.298 --> 35:53.343
Okay.

35:55.867 --> 35:57.695
I'll see to it she's escorted
out in the morning.

35:57.695 --> 35:59.305
You can't kick her out.

35:59.305 --> 36:00.741
She's sick.

36:00.741 --> 36:03.135
Because of you, because
of what you made her do.

36:03.135 --> 36:05.442
She's sick because that's what
the world out there

36:05.442 --> 36:07.139
has to offer.

36:07.139 --> 36:08.836
Which is why
we have to do everything

36:08.836 --> 36:10.490
to protect
what we've built here

36:10.490 --> 36:13.537
and not let our personal
feelings cloud our judgment.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.281
What are you
talking about?

36:18.281 --> 36:19.804
Why did you
bring her back here?

36:19.804 --> 36:21.327
After what we discussed?

36:24.461 --> 36:26.071
Can I trust you, Ali?

36:30.597 --> 36:32.295
Yes.

36:34.819 --> 36:36.473
Good.

36:42.522 --> 36:45.743
And, uh, nice work,

36:45.743 --> 36:47.875
all things considered.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.834
We'll have to wait for Victor
to get back to sign off,

36:49.834 --> 36:52.663
but, uh, I think
you can safely assume

36:52.663 --> 36:56.275
that tomorrow will be your first
official day as Ranger.

36:56.275 --> 36:57.885
Congratulations.

37:25.783 --> 37:27.698
How are you feeling?

37:27.698 --> 37:29.352
I don't really know.

37:49.459 --> 37:52.853
I'm scared, Ali.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.420
I'm really scared.

37:58.119 --> 38:01.558
Will you come with me?

38:01.558 --> 38:02.820
I don't know.

38:02.820 --> 38:05.518
June said I'm supposed
to rest, so...

38:05.518 --> 38:08.608
I know.

38:08.608 --> 38:10.871
But there's something
I really want you to see.

38:15.223 --> 38:16.877
Keep your eyes closed.Okay.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.531
No peeking.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.672
Okay.

38:28.672 --> 38:30.108
Open them.

38:33.633 --> 38:35.243
Happy birthday,
Charlie.

38:40.336 --> 38:43.208
It's -- It's beautiful.

38:55.263 --> 38:58.223
But Strand --
when he finds out, he's --

38:59.442 --> 39:00.965
Okay, you were right.

39:00.965 --> 39:03.533
Something this beautiful
deserves to live,

39:03.533 --> 39:05.230
no matter
how long that is.

39:13.891 --> 39:16.894
i wasn't there for someone
when they needed me before.

39:18.504 --> 39:20.158
This time, I will be.

39:25.032 --> 39:28.079
I'm gonna be there
this time.

39:59.502 --> 40:03.288
I'm gonna be right here next
to you every second of the way.

40:20.566 --> 40:23.482
What's wrong?

40:23.482 --> 40:25.441
Morgan.

40:25.441 --> 40:27.834
I'm supposed to turn off
that light.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.662
I need to find a way to tell him
what's going on.

40:29.662 --> 40:32.186
Hey.
I'll do it.

40:32.186 --> 40:33.971
Okay, don't worry.

40:35.407 --> 40:37.235
I'll take care
of everything.

41:16.143 --> 41:17.841
So, this is why
he sent her?

41:28.460 --> 41:31.985
To disarm the light,
and then what?

41:31.985 --> 41:33.987
And then what?I don't know!

41:33.987 --> 41:35.293
Okay, they want this place
to change,

41:35.293 --> 41:36.642
and that can't happen
with Strand!

41:36.642 --> 41:39.427
Well, that's where you're wrong,
Ali.

41:39.427 --> 41:41.038
It's the only way.

41:44.128 --> 41:45.259
No!

41:45.259 --> 41:46.913
No!

41:56.967 --> 41:59.447
Please --
Please, Howard!

41:59.447 --> 42:01.449
Don't do it, please!

42:03.539 --> 42:06.237
I'm sorry.

42:06.237 --> 42:08.935
It's what Victor would do.

42:21.905 --> 42:23.646
No. No.

42:23.646 --> 42:26.431
If he says no,
we just stay with him.

42:28.999 --> 42:30.261
Charlie, what's wrong?

42:30.261 --> 42:33.177
It's -- It's Ali.
He --

42:33.177 --> 42:34.787
He what?
He just --

42:34.787 --> 42:35.962
What is it?

42:35.962 --> 42:37.529
He...

42:43.404 --> 42:44.971
You --

42:44.971 --> 42:46.756
You killed him!

42:46.756 --> 42:48.584
You killed him!
You killed him!
Charlie, no.

42:48.584 --> 42:50.586
I suggest you back off,
unless you want to join him.

42:50.586 --> 42:52.370
Oh, my God.
You're a monster.

42:52.370 --> 42:53.632
No!

42:53.632 --> 42:55.503
He attacked me!

42:55.503 --> 42:58.506
He left me no choice.

42:58.506 --> 42:59.986
I'm just trying to
protect this place

42:59.986 --> 43:02.336
from those who are trying
to undermine it,

43:02.336 --> 43:03.773
and if you want
this Tower to last,

43:03.773 --> 43:06.123
I suggest
you do the same.

43:06.123 --> 43:08.691
He's right, June.

43:10.649 --> 43:12.956
Whose side are you on here,
John?

43:12.956 --> 43:16.655
I lost everything to that
inhospitable world out there.

43:16.655 --> 43:17.874
You mean your son?

43:19.484 --> 43:21.617
Because he would be ashamed
if he saw this.

43:21.617 --> 43:23.053
If today proved
anything,

43:23.053 --> 43:25.011
it's that we need
to protect this place.

43:25.011 --> 43:26.578
Look what happened
to her out there.

43:26.578 --> 43:27.840
He's right.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.669
Ali paid the price
for what he did.

43:30.669 --> 43:32.192
And now
it's your turn.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.673
You lay one hand on her,
I will kill you myself.

43:34.673 --> 43:35.979
Anything happens to me,

43:35.979 --> 43:37.894
you're gonna have to
answer to Victor.

43:40.548 --> 43:43.334
No, I won't.

43:43.334 --> 43:46.946
Because he knows
the same thing that I do.

43:46.946 --> 43:48.339
And what's that?

43:48.339 --> 43:49.906
He needs me.

43:49.906 --> 43:52.735
More than
he needs you.

43:52.735 --> 43:55.651
If anyone in this Tower
gets sick,

43:55.651 --> 43:57.391
anyone gets injured,

43:57.391 --> 43:59.872
he'll have no one
to help them,

43:59.872 --> 44:02.701
and this place will fall.

44:02.701 --> 44:05.878
Charlie stays with me,
under my care.

44:05.878 --> 44:07.532
That's the deal.

44:11.797 --> 44:13.407
Fine.

44:15.453 --> 44:17.629
But I suggest
you tread carefully.

44:25.593 --> 44:27.030
What the hell
was that about?

44:27.030 --> 44:28.901
I had to say it,
June.

44:28.901 --> 44:30.294
Because you believe it?

44:30.294 --> 44:32.600
Because I need him
to believe I do.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.080
Why?

44:34.080 --> 44:35.865
There's only one way things
are gonna change,

44:35.865 --> 44:38.563
and that's if I can
get in Strand's ear.

44:38.563 --> 44:40.043
Anyone can listen
to reason.

44:40.043 --> 44:42.262
They just need the right voice
telling it to 'em.

44:42.262 --> 44:43.699
I thought
it could be Howard.

44:43.699 --> 44:45.396
But now,
it's gotta be me.

44:47.877 --> 44:50.053
I thought I had
Virginia's ear, too.

44:52.229 --> 44:53.796
This won't work, John.

44:53.796 --> 44:55.406
It has to.

45:09.333 --> 45:12.466
This is my fault,
Charlie.

45:12.466 --> 45:13.859
I never should've let you
go to that building

45:13.859 --> 45:16.949
in the first place.

45:16.949 --> 45:18.516
Then why did you?

45:22.825 --> 45:25.958
Ever since I got here,
I've been hiding.

45:25.958 --> 45:28.744
Why?

45:28.744 --> 45:31.964
I've been scared,

45:31.964 --> 45:34.880
and until today,
it hasn't hurt anyone but me.

45:40.233 --> 45:44.368
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

45:44.368 --> 45:47.327
I don't deserve it.

45:47.327 --> 45:50.156
But I promise you this --

45:50.156 --> 45:51.767
no matter how much time
you have left,

45:51.767 --> 45:54.073
you will live to see
Strand go down.

45:54.073 --> 45:57.033
I will do everything I can
to make sure that happens.

46:06.607 --> 46:07.739
Thank you.

46:16.922 --> 46:18.924
Take your masks off.

46:18.924 --> 46:20.926
What exactly are we up against
out there?

46:20.926 --> 46:22.449
D said a hundred dead
outside.

46:27.280 --> 46:28.716
-Run.
-No.

46:28.716 --> 46:30.196
Boo.

46:30.196 --> 46:31.589
This could make
all the difference.

46:31.589 --> 46:33.199
Yeah, it's a start.

46:33.199 --> 46:35.680
What's scary is what
I'm gonna have to do to them.

46:50.477 --> 46:53.437
Mourning Cloak
is the type of butterfly

46:53.567 --> 46:56.135
that Ali is
tasked with collecting.

46:56.266 --> 47:00.400
Careful, kid. Victor's
particular about those.Howard sent for me.

47:00.531 --> 47:03.055
Strand, while he's
a presence in this episode,

47:03.186 --> 47:05.188
he's not physically
at the tower.

47:05.318 --> 47:09.714
So Howard is kind of the de
facto number two left in charge,

47:09.845 --> 47:11.716
and it was bringing up
all these questions

47:11.847 --> 47:13.761
of what happens
when Strand's away.

47:13.892 --> 47:15.589
This is not just
any butterfly.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.896
This is
the Mourning Cloak.

47:18.027 --> 47:20.986
Extremely rare,
live for about a year.

47:21.117 --> 47:24.424
And Victor has got the perfect
spot for it on the shelf.

47:24.555 --> 47:27.384
Show Victor
what you're capable of,

47:27.514 --> 47:30.604
that you can be something.

47:30.735 --> 47:33.694
Ali's a young man who clearly
wants to do right

47:33.825 --> 47:35.783
by Strand, who's ambitious,

47:35.914 --> 47:38.090
who is very loyal to the tower.

47:38.221 --> 47:40.353
So Howard wants to reward him
for that.Gotcha!

47:42.573 --> 47:44.357
There's a layer to that
for Howard

47:44.488 --> 47:46.011
that we'll start to unpack

47:46.142 --> 47:48.796
about Howard's relationship
to his own family.

47:48.927 --> 47:51.147
We've heard him mention it
briefly at the end of Season 6.

47:51.277 --> 47:52.888
You a religious man?

47:54.672 --> 47:57.980
No.
My wife was.

47:58.110 --> 48:00.460
Said
it would protect me.

48:01.766 --> 48:04.682
So much for that.There's more that we'll learn
about Howard

48:04.812 --> 48:06.118
and what happened
with his own family

48:06.249 --> 48:07.772
that I think we'll understand

48:07.903 --> 48:10.035
why he has such
a unique relationship with Ali.

48:10.166 --> 48:13.386
Hell of a day, Ali.And so, you know,
there's a unique opportunity

48:13.517 --> 48:17.042
there for Howard to kind of
get him to do his bidding,

48:17.173 --> 48:20.132
which is to find out why
Charlie's really in the tower.

48:20.263 --> 48:22.178
She said
she came on her own.

48:22.308 --> 48:23.744
She wants to live here.

48:23.875 --> 48:25.833
That very well
might be true,

48:25.964 --> 48:28.749
but we need to consider
the possibility it might not be.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.490
It's this
terrible combination

48:30.621 --> 48:33.276
of a really brilliant,
savvy move from Howard

48:33.406 --> 48:34.842
and also a bit cruel

48:34.973 --> 48:37.889
to put a young kid
through something like this.

48:44.026 --> 48:46.985
Charlie and Ali connect right
away for one simple reason --

48:47.116 --> 48:49.683
they're both young people
in the apocalypse.

48:49.814 --> 48:51.947
I have always wanted
to play a game.

48:52.077 --> 48:53.600
You've never
bowled before?

48:53.731 --> 48:56.255
They had to grow up
way too fast.

48:56.386 --> 48:59.737
Neither of them have been able
to have this kind of connection,

48:59.867 --> 49:01.739
you know,
that sort of first love,

49:01.869 --> 49:05.482
first, you know, butterflies
in the stomach kind of feeling.

49:05.612 --> 49:09.181
And Ali helping her learn
how to bowl is huge for her

49:09.312 --> 49:11.183
because it makes
her feel like a kid,

49:11.314 --> 49:13.490
it makes her feel alive.

49:13.620 --> 49:15.100
It's not just surviving.

49:15.231 --> 49:16.188
She's actually living.

49:16.319 --> 49:17.276
That was good, right?

49:20.366 --> 49:22.978
We should...
really get going.

49:25.023 --> 49:27.112
I think Ali recognizes as well

49:27.243 --> 49:30.550
that even though Charlie
came to the tower

49:30.681 --> 49:33.075
with some negative intentions
from his perspective,

49:33.205 --> 49:35.338
ultimately,
it was all because

49:35.468 --> 49:37.079
she wants to have
this normal life.

49:37.209 --> 49:39.342
And that's
why Ali turns around,

49:39.472 --> 49:42.258
because he understands Charlie
in a new way.

49:42.388 --> 49:44.434
Why's Strand got you out
collecting butterflies?

49:44.564 --> 49:46.740
They only live
for a year tops.

49:46.871 --> 49:48.525
And you think
that makes it okay?

49:49.743 --> 49:51.789
Don't you think
that something like that

49:51.919 --> 49:54.052
should get the chance
to live...

49:54.183 --> 49:55.749
even if it's
just for a little while?

49:55.880 --> 49:58.926
I think that's front and center
at Ali's mind,

49:59.057 --> 50:01.842
'cause he's realized Charlie's
a bit like that butterfly now.

50:01.973 --> 50:03.931
She is someone to him
that is beautiful

50:04.062 --> 50:06.064
and is going to have
a very short life

50:06.195 --> 50:08.023
because of her
radiation exposure.

50:08.153 --> 50:10.895
So I think him freeing
the butterflies...

50:11.026 --> 50:12.766
Happy birthday, Charlie.

50:12.897 --> 50:16.596
...is an act of wanting to show
her how much he cares about her,

50:16.727 --> 50:20.600
but also because it really
is a metaphor for Charlie.

50:20.731 --> 50:21.862
It's beautiful.

50:33.961 --> 50:35.267
Aah! Aah!

50:37.139 --> 50:39.315
Don't do it! Please!

50:39.445 --> 50:40.533
I'm sorry.

50:42.231 --> 50:45.234
It's what Victor
would do.

50:45.364 --> 50:48.628
In June's mind, Howard
has crossed a huge line.

50:48.759 --> 50:50.674
You're a monster.
No!

50:50.804 --> 50:53.720
He attacked me!
He left me no choice.

50:53.851 --> 50:55.766
Howard's giving
into his worst instinct.

50:55.896 --> 50:56.941
He's in a position
where he wants to

50:57.072 --> 50:58.725
punish June and Charlie.

50:58.856 --> 51:01.380
Lay one hand on her,
I will kill you myself.

51:01.511 --> 51:04.035
Anything happens to me, you're
gonna have to answer to Victor.

51:04.166 --> 51:05.645
He needs me.

51:05.776 --> 51:07.212
More than he needs you.

51:07.343 --> 51:09.432
This is a conflict
that is gonna start to brew.

51:09.562 --> 51:11.912
We know that there's one coming
from outside the tower,

51:12.043 --> 51:13.349
but now there's one inside.

51:13.479 --> 51:14.959
I'm just trying
to protect this place

51:15.090 --> 51:16.439
from those who are
trying to undermine it.

51:16.569 --> 51:19.572
He's right.
If today proved anything,

51:19.703 --> 51:21.792
it's that we need
to protect this place.

51:21.922 --> 51:23.881
I suggest
you tread carefully.

51:25.970 --> 51:29.365
And ultimately we kind of
get inside Dorie Sr.'s head.

51:29.495 --> 51:30.975
What the hell
was that about?

51:31.106 --> 51:32.933
There's only one way
things are gonna change,

51:33.064 --> 51:35.284
and that's if I can
get in Strand's ear.

51:35.414 --> 51:37.286
Anyone
can listen to reason.

51:37.416 --> 51:39.070
They just need the right voice
telling it to them.

51:39.201 --> 51:41.768
I thought it could be Howard,
but now it's got to be me.

51:41.899 --> 51:43.379
It's a tightrope
that he's walking

51:43.509 --> 51:46.773
because Howard
is Strand's ultimate loyalist,

51:46.904 --> 51:48.862
but Dorie Sr.
has his own perspective

51:48.993 --> 51:51.648
and he wants to see things
change for the tower

51:51.778 --> 51:53.606
and the better
before they go down a bad path

51:53.737 --> 51:54.912
that there's
no coming back from.

51:55.042 --> 51:57.349
This won't work, John.It has to.

52:06.489 --> 52:08.317
No matter how much time
you have left,

52:08.447 --> 52:10.493
you will live
to see Strand go down.

52:10.623 --> 52:13.626
I will do everything I can
to make sure that happens.

52:13.757 --> 52:17.543
Charlie seeing the Mourning
Cloak is very bittersweet.

52:17.674 --> 52:19.502
It's a symbol of Ali.

52:19.632 --> 52:21.808
It's a symbol
of her feelings for Ali.

52:21.939 --> 52:23.680
She has felt this connection

52:23.810 --> 52:25.986
with someone who was
cut tragically short.

52:26.117 --> 52:28.293
But like Ali said,
something that beautiful

52:28.424 --> 52:30.774
should get the chance to live,
even if just for a little while.
