Episode 4: Girlfriend

00:20.040 --> 00:22.424
<i>It was a typical Saturday night
in suburbia,</i>

00:22.544 --> 00:24.651
<i>and Wendy's party
was the kind of shit party</i>

00:24.771 --> 00:26.288
<i>that happened most weekends.</i>

00:26.408 --> 00:29.044
<i>Her parents were upstairs,
waiting for the house to be trashed.</i>

00:29.164 --> 00:31.859
<i>They'd be down at 11:30 anyway,
to turf us all out.</i>

00:31.979 --> 00:33.108
<i>We were downstairs,</i>

00:33.228 --> 00:36.050
<i>bored senseless and wondering
how we'd ever get laid.</i>

00:36.170 --> 00:39.545
<i>And anyone who is in any way cool
was somewhere else.</i>

00:40.226 --> 00:42.641
Can you get off the arm rest, please?

00:43.449 --> 00:45.171
Although it was nice of you
to invite me,

00:45.291 --> 00:47.319
this doesn't seem
like a very cool party.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.639
I'm sorry. Did you cancel a night out
with Paris Hilton to be here?

00:51.213 --> 00:52.485
Do you have any more beer?

00:52.578 --> 00:55.421
I think there's a box of my dad's
small beers left. Don't drink it all

00:55.484 --> 00:57.760
cos Charlotte Hinchcliffe
and her mates will be here soon.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.679
Yeah, right, like she's gonna come.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.966
- Why wouldn't she come?
- She's fit and popular,

01:02.039 --> 01:04.233
- therefore she won't be coming.
- - Who won't be coming?

01:04.354 --> 01:06.297
- Charlotte Hinchcliffe.
- I'd make her come...

01:06.417 --> 01:07.481
All over my face!

01:07.919 --> 01:11.671
She has to get special bras made
because not only are her tits so big,

01:11.791 --> 01:13.279
but they are perfectly round.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.040
Like porn star tits.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.923
And she's a slag. She once
munched off the whole rugby team.

01:18.043 --> 01:20.040
- Can that be true?
- No word of a lie.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.674
- I heard that.
- Our school doesn't have a rugby team.

01:22.751 --> 01:24.396
- It was another school.
- Which one?

01:24.465 --> 01:25.334
It happened.

01:25.454 --> 01:27.409
You should be able
to tell me where it happened.

01:27.483 --> 01:30.199
- {\You can}Ask her yourself when she gets here.
- Except she won't be here!

01:30.361 --> 01:33.639
- Jay, I'm off, mate. See you soon.
- All right then, mate.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.359
- Who was that?
- Just a friend.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.798
You've made a new friend?

01:38.918 --> 01:42.120
Oh, a friend!
Since when have you had other friends?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.519
Oh, a friend!

01:43.680 --> 01:45.857
I knew him from when
we were doing trials at West Ham.

01:45.977 --> 01:47.968
He's moved into the area.
He's just some guy.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.807
- Some guy!
- Oh, he's just some guy.

01:49.927 --> 01:51.804
- Oh, he's just some guy.
- That's all it is.

01:51.924 --> 01:54.618
Just a friend from when Jay had trials
at West Ham... That never happened.

01:54.738 --> 01:57.199
- Don't forget the thumbs up.
- Oh, friend! Oh, new friend.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.760
- Friend!
- Please be my friend.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.040
- Oh, friend.
- Oh, friend.

02:02.309 --> 02:03.719
Fuck you lot. Where's the beer?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.448
- We're out.
- I'm going to the loo.

02:05.568 --> 02:07.319
What, for a wank? You wanker.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.604
Friend!

02:10.050 --> 02:12.048
See if you can find
some more beer on the way back.

02:12.168 --> 02:14.479
Check the washing machine.
That's where I'd hide it.

02:14.641 --> 02:16.199
No-one ever puts any in the fridge.

02:22.591 --> 02:24.279
Fucking hell, she has turned up.

02:24.547 --> 02:27.479
This is now officially
the coolest party we have ever been to.

02:27.641 --> 02:29.569
Try and look at cool, then.

02:39.557 --> 02:42.520
<i>As expected,
the kitchen was a booze-free zone.</i>

02:43.009 --> 02:45.236
<i>Apart from one small beer
in the washing machine,</i>

02:45.356 --> 02:47.199
<i>which was presumably Neil's.</i>

02:47.361 --> 02:50.296
<i>I assumed there wouldn't be any
in the fridge, but what the hell.</i>

02:50.416 --> 02:53.143
<i>And to my surprise, I hit the jackpot!</i>

02:57.417 --> 02:59.436
Think you've got my champagne.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.150
God.

03:02.044 --> 03:02.999
Sorry.

03:03.119 --> 03:05.283
You've opened it now,
you might as well grab a glass.

03:05.403 --> 03:06.945
Right, yes.

03:07.285 --> 03:08.506
Thanks. Sorry.

03:09.794 --> 03:12.171
Did you know
the original champagne glass

03:12.291 --> 03:14.759
is said to be modelled
on Marie Antoinette's breast?

03:14.981 --> 03:17.610
Do you always start off a conversation
by talking about breasts?

03:17.730 --> 03:19.280
No... How has it gone?

03:19.845 --> 03:21.547
- Quite badly.
- Right.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.255
She's amazing.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.014
- Who?
- That girl.

03:26.495 --> 03:28.317
Her eyes are beautiful.

03:28.738 --> 03:31.363
You get weird around girls,
like a stalker.

03:31.483 --> 03:33.236
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

03:33.356 --> 03:35.606
Where's that muppet with our drinks?

03:40.644 --> 03:43.295
I haven't told my old friends
I've joined a state comprehensive yet.

03:43.415 --> 03:45.527
They think I'm here
doing voluntary work for Unicef.

03:45.919 --> 03:47.199
You pretentious twat!

03:48.960 --> 03:50.860
- Did you get us any beers?
- Hi, Jay.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.423
If you really want a laugh,
you should come and chat with me.

03:53.543 --> 03:56.326
- I'm about 50 times funnier than him.
- Is he for real?

03:56.446 --> 03:58.401
- Regrettably, yes.
- I'm totally for real.

03:58.521 --> 04:01.438
- Everybody knows I'm funnier.
- Even you'd say so, wouldn't you?

04:01.558 --> 04:05.707
- Well, no, not really.
- All right, funny boy, make me laugh.

04:06.188 --> 04:07.715
Without undressing.

04:36.228 --> 04:37.343
Crazy frog.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.479
If Will ever stops being funny,
I'll let you know. Come on, you.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.816
- What the hell is going on?
- Fuck knows.

04:51.936 --> 04:54.505
Her and her mates must be having
a snog a twat competition.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.559
That can't be happening,
else someone would have claimed you.

04:58.312 --> 04:59.752
This is brilliant news.

04:59.872 --> 05:02.506
How is will getting off
with Charlotte Big Jugs brilliant news?

05:02.626 --> 05:04.199
It means things really have changed.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.831
Girls might be about to notice us
for who we actually are.

05:06.951 --> 05:08.559
You're fucked, because you're a twat.

05:08.876 --> 05:09.736
Nice.

05:18.662 --> 05:19.749
Oh, my God.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.999
I thought she was seeing
someone in our year.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.424
I heard she was seeing Donovan.

05:24.642 --> 05:26.062
No, who is it?

05:26.182 --> 05:28.680
Is it Donovan, Neil? Cos he's a nutter
and we should warn Will.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.919
It's someone.

05:30.190 --> 05:32.039
- Is it Donovan?
- I can't think.

05:32.514 --> 05:33.519
Let me think.

05:33.888 --> 05:34.879
That guy...

05:35.285 --> 05:36.319
What's his name?

05:36.812 --> 05:38.487
This isn't a practical joke, is it?

05:38.607 --> 05:40.742
Because if it is, then I'm...
I'm fine with that.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.113
It would be nice to know
so we can have a laugh about it,

05:43.233 --> 05:46.480
at my expense, and then...
get on with our lives.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.123
No, it's not a practical joke.

05:48.341 --> 05:51.181
Great, sure, no. Didn't think it was.

05:58.481 --> 06:00.631
- I liked that kiss.
- So did I.

06:01.232 --> 06:03.365
And if you're lucky, you might get more.

06:04.124 --> 06:05.450
Oh, my God, sex?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.867
I'm not gonna have sex with you, Will!

06:07.987 --> 06:09.400
No, no, of course not.

06:10.033 --> 06:11.485
How about we...

06:12.348 --> 06:13.639
don't have sex in here?

06:14.571 --> 06:15.609
All right.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.799
- Was it Donovan, Neil?
- I'm trying to think who it was.

06:26.992 --> 06:30.209
- Yeah, it was Donovan.
- You fucking idiot.

06:32.118 --> 06:34.464
- Will's dead.
- Shit, we should do something.

06:34.584 --> 06:37.239
After he gets beaten up,
we could take him to hospital.

06:37.801 --> 06:40.399
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Right, don't say anything.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.196
- All right?
- Yep, yep. Yeah, I'm all right.

06:43.316 --> 06:45.990
I heard your mate is with Charlotte.

06:46.176 --> 06:48.519
- Dunno. Don't think so.
- Yeah, they're upstairs.

06:48.681 --> 06:49.677
Cheers.

06:51.716 --> 06:52.480
What?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.168
- So sorry, Mr and Mrs Dean.
- That's OK, Mark.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.880
Hope you're having a nice time.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.650
- The loo's on the left.
- Thank you very much.

07:13.804 --> 07:16.719
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you. Leave.

07:17.176 --> 07:18.176
No, stay.

07:18.991 --> 07:21.563
Mark, it's finished. Now, please go.

07:22.321 --> 07:24.618
I'm not leaving till you tell me
it's over and you mean it.

07:24.738 --> 07:26.840
It's over and I mean it.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.800
- I think you should leave.
- What, you're telling me to leave?

07:31.281 --> 07:32.680
- Yes.
- Or what?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.479
- Don't hit him. Just go.
- Or what?

07:34.641 --> 07:36.266
Mark, please. For me.

07:37.281 --> 07:38.159
Just go.

07:40.031 --> 07:41.581
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

07:41.850 --> 07:43.599
All right, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.284
Good, cos I was gonna call
Wendy's parents,

07:47.404 --> 07:50.223
- and don't think that I won't.
- OK, mate, two things, yeah?

07:50.343 --> 07:52.141
One, be nice to her,

07:52.771 --> 07:55.945
because she is kind
and fragile and gentle,

07:56.280 --> 07:57.830
not like people think.

07:58.407 --> 07:59.405
And two...

08:00.030 --> 08:02.199
If you tell anyone I said that,
I will kill you.

08:02.361 --> 08:03.611
I will kill you!

08:10.323 --> 08:11.359
What a dickhead!

08:16.315 --> 08:17.964
Fucking hell, he's leaving.

08:18.084 --> 08:19.817
No screams
and he's not covered in blood.

08:19.937 --> 08:23.845
- Will must have got away with it.
- Or Donovan killed them both silently.

08:23.965 --> 08:26.319
She is so beautiful
and she keeps looking at me.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.159
She's only looking to see
if you've stopped staring at her.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.520
- She's still looking.
- Because you're freaking her out.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.850
I think we've got a connection.

08:33.970 --> 08:37.251
- Her eyes! Why don't we go over?
- No, I don't need to pull.

08:37.371 --> 08:40.078
- I've got a sure thing lined up.
- A midweek wank?

08:40.198 --> 08:42.472
I've entered
that charity blind date thing at school.

08:42.592 --> 08:44.474
- That's tragic.
- That's where you're wrong.

08:44.594 --> 08:47.257
Because I get the choice of three girls
to take out on a date.

08:47.377 --> 08:50.601
So I don't need to spend my Saturday
evening scaring girls like Simon does.

08:50.721 --> 08:53.601
What if she's feeling the same and
neither of us does anything about it?

08:53.721 --> 08:55.662
She's fit and she's the year above.

08:55.782 --> 08:58.159
- She'll never go for you.
- Look, Will... Will, yeah,

08:58.320 --> 08:59.999
has pulled Charlotte Hinchcliffe.

09:00.655 --> 09:03.900
Anything could happen tonight.
I'm going over.

09:06.975 --> 09:08.029
Go away.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.239
<i>With Simon's humiliation,
the party was over,</i>

09:12.470 --> 09:15.039
<i>and some of us had done
better than others.</i>

09:15.407 --> 09:17.723
I don't get it.
Charlotte Tits could have had me,

09:17.843 --> 09:19.393
and she went for that?

09:19.591 --> 09:22.537
- Come on, then, what did you get?
- Well, a gentleman never tells.

09:22.657 --> 09:24.234
- A bender never tells.
- Brilliant.

09:24.354 --> 09:26.535
Come on, did you get a chew
on her boobies or not?

09:26.655 --> 09:28.600
- I can neither confirm nor deny.
- Bender.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.775
Don't listen to them. This is brilliant.
Are you seeing her again?

09:31.895 --> 09:34.627
I've got to call her tomorrow.
She said we should hook up soon.

09:34.747 --> 09:35.698
Amazing.

09:36.817 --> 09:39.069
And don't tell my dad anything yet.
It'll only set him off.

09:39.189 --> 09:40.000
Course.

09:45.587 --> 09:46.959
- Good night?
- No, boring.

09:47.467 --> 09:48.359
Will pulled.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.653
Did you, Will? Good work.

09:51.739 --> 09:52.479
Thanks.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.786
When I was your age,
I used to love house parties.

09:54.906 --> 09:57.724
Getting off with some bird, one of the
upstairs rooms, underneath the coats.

09:57.844 --> 09:58.974
Dad, can we not...?

09:59.094 --> 10:02.412
In fact, I think I met your mum
at a house party, Simon.

10:02.532 --> 10:05.080
- Jesus Christ.
- She was wild.

10:05.241 --> 10:07.786
And after that, she didn't
just like keeping it upstairs.

10:07.906 --> 10:10.356
No, we did it in the kitchen,
in the garage...

10:10.476 --> 10:12.473
I think we notched one
up in the greenhouse once.

10:12.593 --> 10:14.911
- Stop the car, I'm gonna walk home.
- Come on, Simon!

10:15.031 --> 10:17.639
Me and your mum like doing it too,
you know.

10:18.988 --> 10:21.547
- They do it in your house, Si!
- Dad!

10:22.206 --> 10:25.083
- You're so embarrassing.
- Your mum loves it!

10:32.926 --> 10:35.098
<i>Two days had now passed
since I kissed Charlotte,</i>

10:35.218 --> 10:37.161
<i>which meant it probably
wasn't a wet dream.</i>

10:37.281 --> 10:39.141
Hello, stranger. Hello, boys.

10:39.261 --> 10:41.272
<i>Pulling me at a party of geeks
was one thing,</i>

10:41.392 --> 10:43.222
<i>but how would she treat me at school?</i>

10:43.342 --> 10:45.692
How are you? What have you been up to?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.719
On Sunday,
me and Sarah went up to London,

10:47.880 --> 10:50.839
bought some vibrating love eggs
and put them in on the train back.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.400
And where did you eat in London?

10:55.339 --> 10:56.725
Did you hear what I said?

10:56.845 --> 11:00.037
It just sounded like a private matter
so I thought best not to intrude.

11:00.157 --> 11:02.159
Does it intimidate you
when I talk about sex?

11:02.594 --> 11:04.120
No. Not at all.

11:04.715 --> 11:07.599
I'm just interested
in London restaurants and stuff.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.723
You have had sex before, haven't you?

11:09.843 --> 11:13.520
Yes. Yes. Loads.
I've done it with two different girls.

11:14.224 --> 11:15.599
I've had 11 lovers already.

11:16.976 --> 11:20.268
Five girls, actually.
Sorry, it was five, not two.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.119
All right, stud. Who were they, then?

11:22.532 --> 11:24.972
- A girl I met in Australia.
- Australia?

11:25.092 --> 11:27.535
- I went there on holiday.
- When was that?

11:27.655 --> 11:28.655
2005.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.119
So you were 13?

11:30.414 --> 11:33.393
- I was very mature for my age.
- Older woman, was she?

11:33.513 --> 11:35.353
She was a couple of years younger.

11:35.473 --> 11:37.523
- So she was 11?
- Christ, no!

11:37.659 --> 11:38.909
I mean...

11:39.480 --> 11:42.418
yes... I suppose she must have been.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.999
- Jesus, 11.
- And what about the other four?

11:45.119 --> 11:47.295
Had they reached puberty
when you'd slept with them?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.160
God, yes, they were very recent.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.230
One was a couple of weeks ago,
another one was...

11:52.821 --> 11:54.975
- a few days ago.
- I see.

11:55.430 --> 11:59.152
I reckon you should come round
on Friday night and, you know...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.470
God, you mean...

12:02.760 --> 12:05.440
you know... on... on Friday?

12:05.783 --> 12:07.851
- Why not, it's no big deal.
- Not a big deal.

12:07.971 --> 12:10.920
- I'm not a virgin, you're not a virgin.
- I'm so not a virgin.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.268
I believe you.

12:28.561 --> 12:29.929
What are you doing?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.799
- I'm reading.
- That's what I meant.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.038
I don't know how anyone bothers
with this shit.

12:34.158 --> 12:35.680
It's like a slow version of TV.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.559
- Then why bother?
- For Blind Date.

12:37.856 --> 12:39.664
It'll make me sound clever
if I say I read,

12:39.784 --> 12:41.135
and girls like clever blokes.

12:41.285 --> 12:44.479
But once a girl speaks to you she'll
realise you're not a clever bloke.

12:44.641 --> 12:46.839
Exactly, that's why I'm saying
that I read books.

12:47.001 --> 12:49.951
No, not exactly
because you'll still seem stupid

12:50.071 --> 12:51.976
even though you've lied
about reading books.

12:52.096 --> 12:53.070
Exactly.

12:53.343 --> 12:55.365
OK then, Neil, that clears it up.
Good plan.

12:55.485 --> 12:57.287
You coming round mine tonight,
play Pro Evo?

12:57.407 --> 12:59.959
Depends. Will your friend the footballer
be there?

13:00.120 --> 13:02.732
Oh, friend. Football friend.

13:03.481 --> 13:05.880
Oh, best friends for ever and ever.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.150
Oh, friend.

13:07.270 --> 13:08.800
Fuck off, he's not my friend.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.919
All right.
You're touchy about your friends.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.982
Come round mine tonight, my dad's out.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.520
- At last.
- I mean going out.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.360
- Cottaging?
- He's playing badminton.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.697
- Sounds like a euphemism.
- We're not going round yours.

13:18.817 --> 13:20.275
- Your house stinks.
- Does not.

13:20.395 --> 13:22.434
- It does smell odd.
- Like what?

13:22.720 --> 13:25.071
- It just smells like being poor.
- Fuck off!

13:25.191 --> 13:26.903
- Shit.
- Charlotte again?

13:27.023 --> 13:29.100
I don't know why she doesn't
come over and say hello.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.293
Because she doesn't want
to be seen dead with you.

13:31.413 --> 13:34.239
On Friday she'll be doing more
than being seen dead with me.

13:34.401 --> 13:36.119
- You're having sex?
- Nice.

13:36.645 --> 13:39.559
- Does she know you're still a virgin?
- I told her I got laid last week.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.713
Last week? Shit.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.239
Here's a tip for you.
The more fingers up, the better.

13:45.594 --> 13:47.839
They fucking love it.
Try to get at least three.

13:49.974 --> 13:52.279
What? I'm telling you,
all the birds I've shagged love that.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.639
- So no birds love that, then.
- Your mum loved it.

13:54.843 --> 13:55.843
Brilliant.

13:55.963 --> 13:58.199
Knowing my luck,
she'll have dumped me by Friday anyway.

13:58.361 --> 14:00.519
Especially as she's using you
to get back at Donovan.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.666
- What?
- It's obvious. Everyone can see it.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.159
It's still great for you cos
you get a go on those fantastic tits.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.959
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

14:08.157 --> 14:10.603
No offence, but you don't look much
like her type.

14:10.723 --> 14:12.159
She goes for big rugby players.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.727
- 15 at a time, sometimes.
- Fuck off!

14:15.040 --> 14:17.039
Fuck off, the lot of you.
You don't know her.

14:17.159 --> 14:18.827
I'm only trying
to look after you.

14:18.947 --> 14:21.479
You're just jealous because
a fit girl fancies me and not you.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.295
- Come on, don't be a dick.
- It's not all about looks,

14:24.415 --> 14:26.601
and beautiful women like Charlotte
understand that.

14:26.721 --> 14:28.853
Maybe if you weren't so obsessed
by that asshole Carli,

14:28.973 --> 14:31.039
who's just stringing you along,
you'd see that.

14:31.159 --> 14:34.509
Fine, get your stupid
fucking heart broken, I don't care.

14:34.847 --> 14:38.119
I've had mates before you and
I'll have mates after you've fucked off.

14:40.117 --> 14:42.439
<i>It was true.
Simon still did have his old friends.</i>

14:43.846 --> 14:46.200
- Books get me girls.
- Oh, books. Oh, books.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.781
And he was welcome to them.

14:47.901 --> 14:51.444
- Books. Blind Date books.
- Fuck the book with us, Simon.

14:52.219 --> 14:55.000
<i>Friday rolled around and I was
all dressed up for my,</i>

14:55.120 --> 14:56.851
<i>you know, date with Charlotte.</i>

14:56.971 --> 14:58.642
- Bye, Mum.
- Where are you off to?

14:58.762 --> 15:00.479
- Just to meet a friend.
- Is it a girl?

15:00.724 --> 15:01.999
- No.
- Is it a boy?

15:02.160 --> 15:04.359
No! It's a girl, all right.
Her name's Charlotte.

15:04.532 --> 15:07.728
- Charlotte! It is she pretty?
- Yes. She's beautiful.

15:07.848 --> 15:09.992
She's one of the most popular girls
at school.

15:10.905 --> 15:13.920
Don't go for the good-looking girls,
because everyone's after them.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.072
Someone like you will have
much more of a chance

15:16.192 --> 15:18.692
- of you go for the plainer girls.
- Someone like me?

15:18.812 --> 15:21.852
Trust me, good-looking girls
just break your heart.

15:21.972 --> 15:24.328
Let the good-looking boys
go out with the good-looking girls.

15:24.448 --> 15:26.321
Are you saying
you think I'm not good-looking?

15:26.441 --> 15:28.199
Darling, I think you're beautiful.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.353
Right.

15:30.658 --> 15:32.840
Thanks, Mum. See you later.

15:37.194 --> 15:38.159
Can you not?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.714
- All right, Jay?
- All right?

15:42.787 --> 15:44.737
- Nice car.
- Do you like it?

15:44.972 --> 15:47.298
- Just got new rims for it.
- Yeah, it's well nice.

15:47.418 --> 15:49.658
- Oh, friend.
- Oh, car friend.

15:49.778 --> 15:51.759
Oh, car friend, shall we play football?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.919
I've just got to pop home, but
you can have a drive later, if you like.

15:55.206 --> 15:57.879
- Yeah, maybe. Cheers.
- Thanks, friend!

15:58.329 --> 16:00.959
- Car friend, football.
- Cheers, friend.

16:01.370 --> 16:02.959
See you later, then.

16:07.361 --> 16:09.759
- He's not my fucking friend.
- All right.

16:11.497 --> 16:12.472
Friend!

16:15.498 --> 16:16.908
Friend! Friend!

16:17.612 --> 16:19.772
- Where's your friend?
- Friend!

16:27.680 --> 16:29.959
Just to confirm,
we are going to have sex?

16:30.534 --> 16:32.184
Yes, I can confirm that.

16:32.682 --> 16:35.359
- Told you, Mum.
- Did you just call me mum?

16:35.521 --> 16:38.110
- No! No. God, no.
- Are you all right?

16:38.711 --> 16:40.033
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:41.544 --> 16:43.129
Are you gonna hurt me?

16:43.431 --> 16:45.790
- If you want me to.
- No, sorry, no, I meant...

16:45.910 --> 16:47.560
I know what you meant, Will.

16:48.226 --> 16:49.200
Come on.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.408
I really, really like you.

16:52.359 --> 16:53.369
You know...

16:54.402 --> 16:55.470
I adore you.

16:56.749 --> 16:57.723
A lot.

16:58.264 --> 16:59.537
I like you too.

17:00.412 --> 17:01.320
Come on.

17:17.565 --> 17:18.810
Will... stop.

17:20.736 --> 17:22.118
Don't move your whole body.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.114
Just move your hips, you know.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.623
Right. Sorry.

17:25.852 --> 17:27.919
- Yeah, you know...
- Just my hips.

17:29.985 --> 17:31.441
How would that work?

17:32.347 --> 17:34.041
You sort of just...

17:35.042 --> 17:36.348
Look, forget it.

17:36.477 --> 17:38.599
You haven't done this before, have you?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.064
Sorry, I lied.

17:42.609 --> 17:43.918
Shall we have another go?

17:44.038 --> 17:45.915
I think the moment's gone, to be honest.

17:46.035 --> 17:47.285
Sorry to ask...

17:48.038 --> 17:49.519
Have I just lost my virginity?

17:49.680 --> 17:51.477
I'm not gonna count that one.

17:51.597 --> 17:54.477
- Can I count it, though?
- Probably not, no.

17:56.977 --> 17:59.075
- Shall we cuddle?
- I'm going to get dressed.

17:59.195 --> 18:01.578
You should go before my mum gets back.

18:04.223 --> 18:06.559
And, Will, don't tell your mates, yeah.

18:07.575 --> 18:08.662
My mates?

18:09.548 --> 18:11.048
Not sure I have any.

18:11.453 --> 18:13.789
Will you put your pants on, please?

18:15.316 --> 18:16.732
- Friend.
- Friend.

18:16.852 --> 18:18.925
- Friend.
- Made-up football friends.

18:19.045 --> 18:22.459
- Just give it a fucking rest, will you?
- Hello, isn't that friend's car?

18:23.246 --> 18:25.266
New-rims car friend!

18:26.098 --> 18:28.104
I'll show you how much of a friend
he is.

18:28.224 --> 18:29.474
Fucking friend.

18:30.329 --> 18:32.320
Oh, friend, friend!

18:32.971 --> 18:34.713
Fucking football friend.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.920
I never thought he'd get that wound up.

18:40.975 --> 18:42.960
Jay, what are you doin'?

18:43.120 --> 18:45.160
Oh, friend. Friend!

18:45.415 --> 18:47.960
I'm not your fucking friend, all right?
All right?

18:48.120 --> 18:52.637
- Oh, friend, friend, car friend...
- So are they friends or not?

18:53.040 --> 18:56.982
New car friend, let's go for
a drive some time. See you, friend.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.399
See you later, friend.

18:59.497 --> 19:00.668
Oh, friend.

19:00.788 --> 19:02.838
Friend, friend, football friend.

19:05.861 --> 19:08.519
<i>Later that week,
it was the school's Blind Date show</i>

19:08.729 --> 19:12.045
<i>and I was there to see how
Neil's brilliant book reading plan went.</i>

19:12.405 --> 19:14.178
<i>Even though I wasn't talking to him.</i>

19:14.298 --> 19:17.305
And finally,
the same question to number three.

19:18.115 --> 19:21.479
People say Anna Karenina
because of my aristocratic elbow,

19:21.640 --> 19:24.839
but I'd secretly like to think
I'm more Jane Eyre.

19:27.101 --> 19:28.959
Right, have you made your decision?

19:30.012 --> 19:31.101
I dunno.

19:31.221 --> 19:34.168
I know it's for charity,
but we've still got another one to go.

19:34.288 --> 19:35.279
Get on with it.

19:39.135 --> 19:40.373
Number three.

19:42.498 --> 19:46.359
She's doing her A-levels four years
early and she loves Russian literature.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.559
It's Susie.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.115
Hi, Charlotte, it's me, Will.
I don't want to be a stalker,

19:58.235 --> 20:00.356
but I was wondering
if you could get back to me.

20:00.476 --> 20:03.205
And just so you know, I'm on
the mobile now and not the home number.

20:03.325 --> 20:04.295
Bye, then.

20:04.415 --> 20:07.759
Time for asked to meet the boys,
so boys, out to come.

20:08.358 --> 20:10.533
- All right?
- Hurry up, no swearing.

20:10.653 --> 20:12.760
- All right?
- Where's your girlfriend, then?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.639
She'll be here in a minute.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.001
Right, we won't hang around, then.

20:17.121 --> 20:20.669
Number one, what's your name
and where do you come from?

20:20.789 --> 20:22.839
I'm Nick, I'm from Twickenham...

20:23.233 --> 20:25.170
Have you got a girlfriend?.

20:26.848 --> 20:28.467
- What's her name?
- Charlotte.

20:28.587 --> 20:31.560
It's Charlotte Hinchcliffe, actually.
She's a Year 13.

20:31.720 --> 20:35.360
- Is she pretty?
- She's very pretty, John.

20:36.126 --> 20:37.605
And do you love her?

20:39.366 --> 20:40.720
Yeah, I think I do.

20:44.225 --> 20:45.775
So those are the boys.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.295
Let's meet the lucky lady
who gets to choose one of them.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.514
It's Charlotte from Year 13.

20:53.943 --> 20:55.791
Just like your girlfriend.

20:56.619 --> 20:58.647
What's your name and why are you here?

20:58.767 --> 21:01.316
My name's Charlotte Hinchcliffe
and I'm here for a bit of fun.

21:01.436 --> 21:03.839
That's your girlfriend.
Why is she on a dating thing?

21:04.310 --> 21:05.931
I don't know, John.

21:06.241 --> 21:08.981
Tell us that bit about yourself,
and keep it clean.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.105
Well, I'm single.
I've been messing around with a few boys

21:12.225 --> 21:15.480
and now I'm looking for a real man
who's gonna show me a good time.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.799
I said keep it clean.

21:17.224 --> 21:20.799
I'm looking for a big, strong man
who really knows what he's doing.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.685
I won't tell you again.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.199
OK, let's have your first question.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.532
<i>That was the end
of my first love affair.</i>

21:27.652 --> 21:29.528
<i>To date, my only love affair.</i>

21:29.789 --> 21:31.559
<i>There was only one thing to do.</i>

21:31.727 --> 21:33.277
<i>Run to my mum and cry.</i>

21:33.720 --> 21:34.842
I'm so sad.

21:36.584 --> 21:38.721
I feel sad. You were right, Mum.

21:39.261 --> 21:42.799
I know it hurts, petal,
but it will get better, I promise.

21:43.540 --> 21:46.319
I just started to make friends
and I dumped them all for this girl.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.608
Why don't we move you to another school?

21:49.728 --> 21:52.399
- Stop trying to make me move schools.
- I don't want you bullied again.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.759
I was not bullied.

22:02.604 --> 22:04.927
Hello, Mrs MacKenzie. Is William in?

22:06.195 --> 22:07.768
I'll leave you to it.

22:10.325 --> 22:11.080
What?

22:11.240 --> 22:14.173
Just wanted to know
if you wanted to come out?

22:14.539 --> 22:18.421
Neil's date is that weird girl who's
taking her A-levels four years early.

22:18.541 --> 22:19.929
Turns out she's about 12.

22:20.049 --> 22:21.794
He's at Milwaukee Fried Chicken.

22:21.914 --> 22:23.920
She's so young,
her mum's had to go with her.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.901
The three of them are sitting there
around a bargain bucket.

22:27.021 --> 22:28.354
You should come.

22:28.474 --> 22:30.388
Actually, that does sound quite funny.

22:30.508 --> 22:32.866
- Mum, I'm off out.
- Brilliant.

22:35.425 --> 22:37.516
How's your football friend?

22:37.636 --> 22:39.222
I don't think we're friends any more.

22:39.342 --> 22:42.268
I had to borrow 300 quid to get his car
fixed so he won't call the police.

22:42.388 --> 22:44.733
It was amazing. You should have seen it.

22:44.853 --> 22:46.919
He's a really nice bloke,
I don't know why I did it.

22:47.183 --> 22:49.139
You've got mental problems?

22:51.913 --> 22:54.545
<i>I learnt many things
from my first heartbreak.</i>

22:54.665 --> 22:56.715
<i>I learnt a little about love...</i>

22:57.041 --> 22:57.918
Go away.

22:58.227 --> 22:59.901
<i>A bit about anatomy...</i>

23:00.280 --> 23:02.110
<i>A lot about friendship...</i>

23:02.230 --> 23:04.560
Friend, fucking football friend.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.600
<i>- And nothing about sex...</i>
- Will, stop.

23:08.039 --> 23:10.108
<i>Apart from rubbing up
against the perineum</i>

23:10.228 --> 23:12.707
<i>doesn't count as losing your virginity.</i>

23:14.151 --> 23:16.406
