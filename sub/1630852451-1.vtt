WEBVTT

00:25.000 --> 00:26.875
[thunder rumbling]

00:38.916 --> 00:41.041
[dolphin call]
It's go time!

00:41.125 --> 00:43.375
Target is half a klick southwest.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.000
Don't mess this up, seals.

00:46.625 --> 00:48.166
I don't make mistakes.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.708
Oh? The X47 death balloon.

01:02.791 --> 01:06.333
This one's really deadly.
Uh, I'm gonna call a human.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.708
No. We got this.

01:11.916 --> 01:15.500
Uh, Claggart? You-- You sure
we shouldn't get a human?

01:15.583 --> 01:17.208
I-I feel like we should get a human.

01:17.291 --> 01:22.000
You know, you cut the wrong wire,
we'll all be boom! Agh!

01:22.083 --> 01:25.083
-The pain! The pain!
-Switch! Focus.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.041
-Yeah, focus. Focus.
-What's taking so long, Claggart?

01:28.125 --> 01:30.916
I got a photoshoot
with <i>National Aquatic </i>after this.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.875
This isn't as easy
as going "Ek-ek-ek-ek-ek," Dolph!

01:39.666 --> 01:42.458
-[gasps]
-[shrieks]

01:42.541 --> 01:43.375
[chomp]

01:56.375 --> 01:57.375
Ten-hut!

01:58.250 --> 02:01.125
[baby-talk] Do my good boys
want some tasty sardines?

02:01.208 --> 02:04.125
We don't do this for tasty treats.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.708
We do this for honor, for duty, for--

02:06.791 --> 02:08.458
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!

02:08.541 --> 02:10.083
[baby-talk] Yes, you do!

02:10.166 --> 02:12.708
Now, give me a thumbs-up!

02:20.208 --> 02:22.208
[whirring]

02:26.875 --> 02:29.500
[slow-motion] Run!

02:33.458 --> 02:34.875
[explosion]

02:43.583 --> 02:45.791
[screaming]

02:47.791 --> 02:50.666
[bellowing]

02:51.541 --> 02:54.125
Claggart, I don't want to die

02:54.208 --> 02:59.250
before... I have... my photoshoot!

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
[screams]

03:03.333 --> 03:05.083
[screaming]

03:15.083 --> 03:17.791
Oh, wait, I'm a dolphin. I'm totally fine!

03:17.875 --> 03:19.166
[squeaks]

03:19.250 --> 03:20.791
[sighs]

03:20.875 --> 03:23.458
Brace for impact!

04:27.250 --> 04:29.166
[whispers] So, what's the plan?

04:29.250 --> 04:30.875
Really obvious head-first charge.

04:30.958 --> 04:33.291
Got anything less stupid?

04:33.375 --> 04:36.666
How about the old 1-2-17, back,
forward, inside-out maneuver!

04:36.750 --> 04:37.833
Huh?

04:37.916 --> 04:39.958
Yeah, too complicated.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.458
Ooh! Surprise attack!

04:41.541 --> 04:44.166
-Too obvious.
-Hm.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.500
Super-secret surprise attack?

04:48.625 --> 04:49.583
[both] Hm.

04:49.666 --> 04:52.083
Three.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.416
Two...

04:54.250 --> 04:56.375
Super-secret surprise attack!

04:58.875 --> 05:02.625
Quinn, why do you always have to
shout out the name of the plan?

05:02.708 --> 05:04.875
I got carried away.
But it was such a good plan.

05:04.958 --> 05:05.791
Come on!

05:08.791 --> 05:10.791
[indistinct chatter]

05:16.125 --> 05:17.250
[gasps]

05:19.333 --> 05:20.625
What are you doing?

05:21.791 --> 05:24.666
There could be you-know-what's
lurking out there!

05:24.750 --> 05:26.500
A few ravenous seal-eating sharks

05:26.583 --> 05:29.541
is nothing for
the bravest seal in the ocean.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.791
I, the Great Geraldo,
once escaped from an aquarium

05:33.875 --> 05:37.416
using only my wits
and perfectly symmetrical features.

05:38.791 --> 05:41.458
Have you been waiting for someone
to come past so you could tell that story?

05:41.541 --> 05:43.125
Perhaps.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.708
Perhaps not.

05:44.791 --> 05:48.750
It's all part of my mystique.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.708
[Quinn] We can still see you.

05:53.791 --> 05:54.791
[stomach gurgling]

05:54.875 --> 05:57.583
Oh, come on. Let's go home.

05:57.666 --> 05:59.541
We'll catch a fish tomorrow.

06:02.958 --> 06:06.041
No. We're gonna get a fish today.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.500
-I don't know, Quinn.
-Stay here.

06:08.583 --> 06:12.125
I'll be back before you can say,
"This is a really stupid idea."

06:12.208 --> 06:15.250
This is a really stupid... Ugh!

06:15.333 --> 06:18.125
Quinn! Wait up!

06:21.458 --> 06:22.500
Ha!

06:26.083 --> 06:27.000
Hm.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.458
Oh.

06:30.541 --> 06:33.416
Come on, man.
This is way better than a fish.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.375
Oh, yeah?

06:34.458 --> 06:38.083
-You don't even know what it is.
-Oh, come on.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.458
Of course, I do.

06:39.541 --> 06:42.875
It's a super-awesome, um, shiny thingy.

06:42.958 --> 06:46.833
-A super-awesome whaty-whaty?
-[gasps] Did you see that?

06:47.416 --> 06:49.791
Do you think it would make
a difference if I pretend I didn't?

06:53.416 --> 06:54.666
[both exhaling]

06:54.750 --> 06:57.375
Who wants to get in my face-hole?

06:57.458 --> 06:59.083
[screaming]

07:01.458 --> 07:04.750
-Out of the way!
-No! Find your own lunch!

07:04.833 --> 07:07.500
-Swim for your lives!
-We're doomed!

07:07.583 --> 07:09.416
I don't wanna be food!

07:09.541 --> 07:13.333
[laughs]
Hey, Snap, your face went right into...

07:18.083 --> 07:19.541
[chuckle]

07:19.625 --> 07:21.125
[whimpers]

07:24.833 --> 07:29.583
[screaming]

07:30.583 --> 07:31.500
[chuckles]

07:32.458 --> 07:33.958
Other way, man. Other way!

07:34.041 --> 07:35.708
Are you crazy?
There's sharks back there!

07:35.791 --> 07:37.375
Turn around! Turn around!

07:44.041 --> 07:45.083
Benji?

07:45.750 --> 07:47.041
Benji!

07:47.333 --> 07:48.458
Whoo!

07:48.791 --> 07:51.125
Oh. That was too close.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.125
Come on. We're almost home.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.041
I said, you're going in the face-hole!

07:57.125 --> 07:59.208
No! My face-hole!

08:00.083 --> 08:01.375
Any ideas?

08:01.458 --> 08:03.583
Don't say super-secret surprise attack!

08:03.666 --> 08:05.208
The corkscrew spin!

08:05.291 --> 08:07.000
-You sure about this?
-Nope, not at all.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.750
Three... two...

08:09.833 --> 08:11.250
[laughing]

08:11.333 --> 08:13.458
Corkscrew spin!

08:16.250 --> 08:18.583
No wonder they didn't wanna
go in your face-hole.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.333
It's disgusting in here.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.750
After them!

08:23.916 --> 08:25.541
[screaming]

08:25.625 --> 08:26.916
[groans]

08:28.666 --> 08:29.958
-[exhales]
-[Benji] Quinn?

08:30.833 --> 08:31.791
Yeah?

08:31.875 --> 08:35.916
You shouted out
the name of the plan again.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.583
But we totally nailed it that time.

08:38.666 --> 08:40.250
Do you count not catching a fish

08:40.333 --> 08:43.625
and almost being eaten by a shark
three times as "nailing it"?

08:43.708 --> 08:45.875
Yes.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.166
Kinda, sorta, maybe,
not really, no not at all.

08:49.250 --> 08:52.041
Definitely not. That was
a complete, total failure.

08:53.541 --> 08:55.750
-This is my spot!
-No, it's mine!

08:55.833 --> 08:57.458
Mine, mine, mine.

08:58.708 --> 09:02.083
You do know what you did out there
was really stupid, right?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.125
Stupidly worth it! Check it out!

09:04.208 --> 09:06.000
We could use them to make light signals!

09:06.083 --> 09:09.166
[yelps] My eyes! My eyes!

09:10.791 --> 09:12.875
[chuckling]

09:17.833 --> 09:19.625
I wasn't talking about the thingies.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.291
I meant coming back for me.
You could've been eaten.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.666
We gotta look out for each other, right?

09:29.375 --> 09:31.541
Yeah. No matter what.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.583
[laughing]

09:34.666 --> 09:37.166
Rah! I'm a seal-eating sharky!

09:37.250 --> 09:40.250
-[roars]
-[giggling]

09:40.333 --> 09:43.708
Tag. You're part of the food chain.
[chuckles]

09:43.791 --> 09:46.958
All right, little predator.
It's time for dinner.

09:47.041 --> 09:49.583
Mmm. Barnacles.

09:49.666 --> 09:50.708
[screaming]

09:53.083 --> 09:55.541
-Barnacles!
-[both] Ugh!

09:55.625 --> 09:57.958
They taste like sand and disappointment.

09:58.750 --> 10:02.041
[munches, coughs, groans]

10:03.083 --> 10:07.500
[munches, coughs, gasps, groans]

10:13.708 --> 10:16.208
[coughing, groaning]

10:16.791 --> 10:19.083
And they're particularly
disappointy-ish today.

10:19.166 --> 10:22.250
Ugh! There has got to be
a better way than this.

10:22.333 --> 10:26.083
Oh, there is.
Trick is to lick a rock for flavor.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.791
[slurps] Then stare directly at the sun.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.583
[groans]

10:30.666 --> 10:33.291
The searing pain
removes the disappointment.

10:33.375 --> 10:36.208
Uh... thanks, Beth.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.250
But I was talking about all of this.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.541
Risking our lives every day
to maybe get a fish?

10:41.625 --> 10:44.208
-I'm so sick of barnacles!
-Barnacles are the worst!

10:44.291 --> 10:49.958
Don't worry, seals.
It is almost time for the sardine run.

10:50.041 --> 10:52.375
We'll all get to eat.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.000
-Yeah!
-I love sardines!

10:54.083 --> 10:57.208
-That totally averts any worries I had.
-What about the sharks?

10:57.291 --> 10:58.541
-Sharks?
-Good point.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.583
-Oh, I did not think of that!
-Ha! Hardly a concern.

11:01.666 --> 11:05.458
I can count the amount of sharks
I've seen there on one flipper.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.000
I'd buy that.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.958
-Nothing to worry about.
-That's pretty convincing.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.541
-[stomach gurgling]
-Quinn?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.333
Yeah?

11:21.416 --> 11:25.541
I really hope we catch more of them
awesome shiny thingies tomorrow.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.708
I'm so hungry.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.291
What do you think these things really are?

11:31.375 --> 11:33.083
[yawns] Who knows?

11:33.166 --> 11:35.291
All kinds of shipwrecks around here

11:35.375 --> 11:37.583
filled with weird human stuff.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.583
Yeah.

11:41.125 --> 11:43.041
[snoring]

11:43.125 --> 11:43.958
My spot.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.625
In your dreams.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.166
He is dreaming.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.500
[exhales]

12:12.708 --> 12:13.791
Benji?

12:14.833 --> 12:18.375
-What are you doing out here?
-I'm gonna get us some food.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.208
All kinds of shipwrecks
around here, right?

12:20.291 --> 12:23.083
And humans never
go anywhere without snacks.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.541
Now, go back to sleep.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.333
Breakfast is on me.

12:27.875 --> 12:30.500
Trust me, that's all I wanna do right now.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.791
Some idiot once told me
that we gotta look out for each other.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.041
Well, that guy
must have been pretty stupid.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.166
Uh-huh!

12:40.916 --> 12:42.958
[gasps] Over here.

12:44.666 --> 12:47.000
Humans sure have some interesting snacks.

12:47.458 --> 12:49.333
-Junk.
-Trash.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.041
-Worthless.
-Yum!

12:52.125 --> 12:55.333
-[both yelping]
-Sideways! Sideways! Attack!

12:55.416 --> 12:57.000
La la la la!

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Wow! This is a rough part of the ocean.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.291
[gasps] Tell me about it.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.333
Oh, there's gotta be some food out there.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.250
Yeah, like us, if we go out there.

13:14.333 --> 13:18.291
Come on. We'll be in and out before you
can say, "This is a really stupid idea."

13:21.458 --> 13:24.875
This is a really stupid...
[sighs] I don't know why I bother.

13:26.750 --> 13:27.958
[grunts]

13:40.166 --> 13:41.250
What do you think happened...?

13:41.333 --> 13:44.625
Why would you even think
about asking a question like that?

13:44.708 --> 13:46.250
Just looking for trouble.

13:46.333 --> 13:49.333
It's just that, you know, this is totally
the kind of place that you would find a--

13:49.416 --> 13:52.291
-Don't say it!
-Oh, relax, man. I'm sure we'll be...

13:54.166 --> 13:55.875
Sorry!

13:55.958 --> 13:57.958
[indistinct chatter]

14:04.333 --> 14:06.833
Hello there, little fellas.

14:06.916 --> 14:08.750
-Hello.
-Hello.

14:08.833 --> 14:09.833
'Sup?

14:13.416 --> 14:17.041
[chuckles] What's the rush?

14:17.125 --> 14:19.291
I haven't even introduced myself.

14:19.375 --> 14:24.958
My name's Grimes.
How are you doing today?

14:25.041 --> 14:27.541
-Are you good?
-Are you well?

14:27.625 --> 14:31.208
-Are you fine? [laughs]
-[exhales]

14:31.291 --> 14:33.791
What? I asked if they was fine.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.166
Like you wanted to pick
the scraps off their bones.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.958
Isn't that what we're doing here?

14:39.041 --> 14:42.333
[groans] Obviously,
but we don't want them to...

14:42.416 --> 14:43.833
[screams] My eyes!

14:48.666 --> 14:50.375
We can lose them in there!

14:54.583 --> 14:57.083
-Corkscrew spin?
-Are you sure?

14:57.166 --> 15:00.166
-Hm.
-[sighs] Thought so.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.291
Three.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.666
Two.

15:02.750 --> 15:03.916
One!

15:05.833 --> 15:07.958
[grunts] Whoo-hoo!

15:08.041 --> 15:11.291
See? I'm learning! I didn't even
shout out the name of the plan!

15:12.583 --> 15:13.666
Benji?

15:22.750 --> 15:25.250
Come on. Come on, come on.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.625
Come on, Benji.

15:35.958 --> 15:38.750
[exhales]

15:43.166 --> 15:45.416
[cackles]

15:47.500 --> 15:50.500
[grunts] Benji!

15:55.458 --> 15:57.875
-Did he just...?
-No ways.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.000
Ooh!

16:00.083 --> 16:02.208
You're food.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.916
You're food!

16:11.625 --> 16:13.000
[screams]

16:17.250 --> 16:18.541
[yelps]

16:37.208 --> 16:39.541
[grunts] No! No! Stop it!

16:39.625 --> 16:42.333
This is so undignifying!

16:45.166 --> 16:46.250
[grunts]

16:48.416 --> 16:52.791
This is what happens when you
go up against the food chain.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.291
Food chain can kiss my tailfin.

16:58.791 --> 17:00.375
[grunts]

17:19.375 --> 17:20.833
[gasps]

17:23.625 --> 17:24.791
Hmmf.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.333
-Hm?
-No! You can't eat him!

17:41.416 --> 17:43.125
I thought you'd learned your lesson!

17:43.208 --> 17:44.333
[both yelp]

17:44.833 --> 17:48.458
So, so sorry. We thought
you were, oh, you know...

17:48.541 --> 17:50.125
KIA, roger.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.833
My name is Diving Dee. This is Roger.

17:52.916 --> 17:56.125
-Roger.
-That eloquent lady is Mayday.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.458
[comical gibberish]

17:57.541 --> 17:58.833
Is she all right?

17:58.916 --> 18:02.500
Yeah, she's been trying
to eat that starfish for years.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.541
[comical gibberish]

18:03.625 --> 18:06.250
I think they've formed
a symbiotic relationship.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.250
I'm Quinn.

18:07.333 --> 18:11.458
Well, Quinn, what brings your
unconscious body to these waters?

18:13.375 --> 18:17.333
I went looking for food
with my friend. Benji.

18:21.166 --> 18:25.333
[gasps] An old seal.
He saved me from a shark.

18:25.416 --> 18:28.291
Big mustache. Angry. Face like this.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.583
[grunts]

18:29.666 --> 18:31.458
-Ooh, Claggart.
-Roger.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.041
You know where I can find him?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.625
You're probably safer
going back to the shark.

18:48.708 --> 18:52.208
That old grouch
does not like visitors. Nope.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.000
He does seem to enjoy
inflicting pain on them, though.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.958
Oh, well, it's nice
having known ya, Quinn.

18:59.041 --> 19:02.375
Enjoy the last few moments
of your short, short life.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.583
Over and out. Over.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.041
[grunts]

19:29.708 --> 19:31.166
[growling]

19:34.541 --> 19:37.500
You have exactly ten seconds
to get off my ship

19:37.583 --> 19:40.208
before I teach you the meaning of pain.

19:40.291 --> 19:42.500
Ten, unbelievable pain.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.166
Nine, ridiculous pain.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.791
Eight, worse pain.

19:45.875 --> 19:49.750
The way you took on that shark.
How did you do that?

19:49.833 --> 19:52.375
Ha! Basic flipper-to-flipper combat.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.791
Could you teach me?

19:53.875 --> 19:57.416
[sighs]
That's what my crew used to call an RSI.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.791
R-S...?

19:58.875 --> 20:00.583
A really stupid idea!

20:00.666 --> 20:02.625
Why would you wanna throw your life away?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.500
The other super awesome shiny thingy.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.208
The whata-whata-whata-whaty?

20:08.791 --> 20:10.416
It belonged to my best friend.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.500
Oh. I see.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.416
Well, it's a cold, dark,

20:15.500 --> 20:16.708
cut-the-wrong-wire
-on-a-naval-mine-

20:16.791 --> 20:19.625
and-get-your-whole-team-disbanded
kind of ocean out there, pup.

20:19.708 --> 20:20.875
Weirdly specific.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.791
It's best to go home,
move on with your life,

20:23.875 --> 20:26.125
and leave complete strangers alone!

20:26.500 --> 20:29.458
The only way you're getting rid of me
is to teach me how to fight.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.375
Or throw me off this boat.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.875
-Oh.
-I--I phrased that badly.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.625
I phrased that badly!

20:44.416 --> 20:46.791
-[grunts]
-[screams]

20:50.166 --> 20:52.916
That lesson's for free. Now get lost.

20:58.333 --> 21:02.083
Teach me or the sardines are gonna get it.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.916
You wouldn't dare.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.208
Oh. Wouldn't I?

21:15.541 --> 21:18.250
[singing in Russian]

21:18.333 --> 21:19.625
Not the Tsardines!

21:19.708 --> 21:22.333
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is to get those?

21:22.416 --> 21:25.125
More than anyone.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.333
[sighs]

21:32.208 --> 21:33.458
Come with me.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.500
[gasps]

21:45.125 --> 21:46.875
My years in the service taught me

21:46.958 --> 21:49.958
that this is what you need
to accomplish any mission.

21:52.916 --> 21:55.500
-A photo?
-No! In the photo!

21:55.583 --> 21:57.125
A dolphin smoking a cigar?

21:57.208 --> 21:58.291
No!

21:59.000 --> 22:00.791
A team of soldiers,

22:00.875 --> 22:05.541
brave, stupid, or crazy enough
to follow you into any mission.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.000
No matter how dangerous.

22:08.083 --> 22:13.125
You mean, I should form
some kind of seal ensemble?

22:13.208 --> 22:15.083
-Wanna sing acapella?
-Seal club?

22:15.166 --> 22:16.708
You <i>obviously </i>haven't been to the Arctic.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.833
Wait. I've got it.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.333
Flipper Patrol!

22:23.875 --> 22:25.291
[screams]

22:27.666 --> 22:28.750
[gasps]

22:28.833 --> 22:30.500
Have fun with the sharks!

22:32.500 --> 22:33.916
[groans]

22:38.916 --> 22:40.208
My name is Seal.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.625
You seals have been an amazing audience.

22:43.625 --> 22:48.208
Now, this is the part of the evening
where I want you all to sing along.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.875
Say, "Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf."

22:50.958 --> 22:52.166
[all] Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.166
Now say,
"Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf. Arf. Arf!"

22:55.250 --> 22:56.875
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf! Arf! Arf!

22:56.958 --> 22:59.125
Now say... Quinn?

22:59.208 --> 23:00.083
[all] Quinn?

23:00.166 --> 23:02.291
-Where have you been?
-[all] Where have you been?

23:02.375 --> 23:03.541
Cut it out!

23:04.208 --> 23:06.833
Benji and I went to...

23:08.041 --> 23:10.750
[sighs] There was a shark.

23:13.708 --> 23:14.625
[coughs]

23:14.708 --> 23:19.375
Well, it's best to forget
about all that and have a barnacle.

23:21.291 --> 23:25.708
No! I am so sick of disgusting barnacles.

23:25.791 --> 23:27.708
Don't worry. There's always the...

23:27.791 --> 23:30.250
What, the sardine run? Please!

23:30.333 --> 23:31.916
We all just go into the water

23:32.000 --> 23:33.833
and hope that we're faster
than the next seal.

23:35.125 --> 23:37.875
Aren't you tired of leaving
your friends behind?

23:38.666 --> 23:40.625
I hate to bring up
the painfully obvious,

23:40.708 --> 23:43.458
but it's a shark-eat-seal world
out there, right?

23:43.541 --> 23:44.875
Every seal for themselves.

23:44.958 --> 23:47.041
If it's between him or me,
I'm choosing me.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.291
You jerk! I thought we were friends!

23:50.000 --> 23:52.625
-My spot!
-I've been sitting here for years!

23:52.708 --> 23:54.375
Well, I'm through running.

23:54.458 --> 23:57.208
I'm gonna make sure
we never lose another seal.

23:57.916 --> 24:00.625
-I'm gonna fight back.
-[gasping]

24:00.708 --> 24:04.375
Is there anyone here brave, stupid,
or crazy enough to help me?

24:05.500 --> 24:08.083
Actually, this isn't my spot.
You can have it.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.875
Not even Crazy Steve is that crazy.

24:10.958 --> 24:12.416
[blabbers]

24:12.500 --> 24:15.125
And a shark once spat him out
because he tasted too weird.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.958
All right, back to the music.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.666
Please! Stop!
You guys gotta listen to me.

24:21.916 --> 24:24.708
<i>♪ Quinn is never gonna survive ♪</i>

24:24.791 --> 24:29.083
<i>♪ Because he's a little crazy ♪</i>

24:31.083 --> 24:32.708
Those stupid seals.

24:32.791 --> 24:35.333
Not even stupid enough to fight sharks.

24:36.458 --> 24:39.041
[coughs, groans]

24:40.833 --> 24:42.000
Eh?

24:42.083 --> 24:43.833
Eh-heh?

24:43.916 --> 24:45.583
Thanks, Beth.

24:45.666 --> 24:48.625
But it's gonna take more than rocks
and searing pain to help me.

24:48.708 --> 24:52.041
You need seals brave, stupid,
or crazy enough to fight sharks.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.625
You were there.
How'd it go? Scale of one to ten?

24:54.708 --> 24:56.083
Oh, Quinn.

24:56.166 --> 24:59.125
They haven't invented a number
low enough to describe that.

24:59.208 --> 25:00.541
But look on the bright side--

25:00.625 --> 25:03.833
if you want to fight sharks,
you're obviously very, very stupid.

25:03.916 --> 25:04.750
Hm.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.375
So you're already a third of the way
to forming your own team.

25:08.291 --> 25:10.833
Yeah, you're right.

25:10.916 --> 25:13.583
All I need is someone brave and someone...

25:15.750 --> 25:17.208
Beth!

25:18.416 --> 25:19.333
Me?

25:19.416 --> 25:22.916
Yeah! You're always helping others!
By forcing them to lick rocks.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.958
And you stare directly at the sun
for hours, so you gotta be tough.

25:27.041 --> 25:29.250
I do have a lot of skills.

25:29.333 --> 25:33.208
But fighting sharks is
a little certain death-y for my taste.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.500
I'll get you all the sardines you can eat.

25:36.583 --> 25:40.208
If you really wanna die
a horrible death involving sharks,

25:40.291 --> 25:41.958
I'm gonna help you achieve your goal.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.208
Yes! Thanks! I think.

25:44.291 --> 25:46.291
All we need now is someone brave.

25:46.375 --> 25:50.125
Oh, easy. I know the bravest
seal in the ocean.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.750
Wow, it's a little cold tonight, hm?

25:53.833 --> 25:56.416
Hm, it is a bit chilly.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.416
A slightly chilly evening

25:58.500 --> 26:01.250
is nothing for the bravest seal
in the ocean.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.041
What about fighting sharks?

26:03.125 --> 26:06.875
Fighting sharks is noth...
Actually, it is quite something.

26:06.958 --> 26:09.416
You brave enough to help us do it?

26:10.375 --> 26:12.458
Me? Brave enough?

26:12.541 --> 26:14.541
[chuckles]

26:17.708 --> 26:21.250
I laugh in the face of danger
so much danger says to me,

26:21.333 --> 26:23.625
"Oh, Great Geraldo,
you hurt my feelings."

26:23.708 --> 26:26.833
And then I hold danger
in my arms and I say,

26:26.916 --> 26:30.208
"Sorry, I never meant to hurt you."

26:30.291 --> 26:34.208
So is that a yes on fighting the sharks?

26:34.291 --> 26:38.166
-Perhaps. Perhaps not.
-All a part of your mystique, huh?

26:38.250 --> 26:41.625
[chuckles]
You're a fast learner. I like you.

26:41.708 --> 26:44.875
Uh, one question?
How do we fight the sharks?

26:44.958 --> 26:47.416
The Great Geraldo
also wonders about this.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.541
But does not care about the answer!

26:49.625 --> 26:53.375
I have no idea,
but I know a seal who does.

26:56.708 --> 27:00.041
I found seals brave, stupid,
and, uh, "Beth" enough

27:00.125 --> 27:01.541
to follow me into this mission.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.208
Now will you train us?

27:03.291 --> 27:06.041
You're persistent, pup,
I'll give you that.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.625
But only that!

27:07.708 --> 27:10.958
This is the most blubbery,
pathetic mess of a team I've ever seen!

27:11.041 --> 27:13.083
You don't look so hot yourself, walrus.

27:13.166 --> 27:16.833
[scoffs] And insubordinate, too?
Forget about it!

27:17.625 --> 27:20.458
No. If you don't teach us how to fight,

27:20.541 --> 27:24.416
we're gonna eat every can
of sardines on this entire ship.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.166
I can't promise I won't do that anyway.

27:28.916 --> 27:29.875
Hmmf.

27:31.458 --> 27:35.375
His mystique, it's... magnificent!

27:37.125 --> 27:40.833
So, you pups think you have
what it takes to be in the HMMF?

27:40.916 --> 27:43.000
-Wait, your team was called "hmmf"?
-Hmmf!

27:43.083 --> 27:44.458
Kinda makes sense, I suppose.

27:44.541 --> 27:46.916
It stands for Hydro-Marine Military Force,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.708
the most elite fighting animals
ever to swim in the ocean.

27:49.791 --> 27:52.500
And I don't think you have what it takes.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.125
[grunting]

27:59.208 --> 28:03.125
You gotta be fighting fit, on land...

28:03.208 --> 28:04.625
and in the water.

28:05.833 --> 28:06.833
[gasping]

28:15.625 --> 28:17.625
[thunder rumbling]

28:18.458 --> 28:20.000
You gotta have discipline.

28:23.958 --> 28:26.625
-You ready to quit?
-[all] Seal, no, seal!

28:26.708 --> 28:28.416
A lie-down would be nice, though.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.250
[Claggart]
You gotta be a master of stealth.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.291
Who said that? [screams]

28:35.166 --> 28:37.041
You gotta learn how to do a thumbs-up.

28:39.791 --> 28:41.416
Yeah, we'll come back to this one.

28:41.916 --> 28:43.375
You're gonna need...

28:43.458 --> 28:47.208
-Air support to spot the enemy!
-Roger that. Over.

28:47.291 --> 28:50.458
Shoo, you stupid birds!
This is my training!

28:50.541 --> 28:51.958
Now, where were we?

28:52.041 --> 28:54.708
You were gonna ask if we're ready to quit.
And we were gonna say...

28:54.791 --> 28:57.291
-[all] Seal, no, seal!
-Hmmf!

28:57.958 --> 29:00.375
You're gonna learn pain.

29:00.458 --> 29:01.875
More pain.

29:01.958 --> 29:04.625
Pain! Pain, pain, pain, pain!

29:04.708 --> 29:07.250
Pain! Pain.

29:17.458 --> 29:18.708
[grunts]

29:19.333 --> 29:20.625
You ready to quit?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.500
Never!

29:22.583 --> 29:26.541
Huh, you might just be HMMF
material after all.

29:26.625 --> 29:27.708
Hmmf!

29:27.791 --> 29:31.500
That's the spirit!
But you still have to pass the final test.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.333
What test?

29:33.916 --> 29:35.708
Fighting a shark, of course.

29:38.333 --> 29:41.083
Meet the fiercest predator in the ocean.

29:42.583 --> 29:43.625
Bob.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.166
[chuckles]

29:49.250 --> 29:52.416
An inanimate object is no match--
[yelps]

29:54.541 --> 29:56.708
Is that all you've got?

29:56.791 --> 29:59.958
Internal hemorrhaging is no mat--

30:00.041 --> 30:02.000
[grunts]

30:02.083 --> 30:04.750
Bob! Please stop!

30:04.833 --> 30:06.541
-Bob!
-[chuckles]

30:06.625 --> 30:08.666
Touché, Bob.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.166
[groans]

30:11.750 --> 30:13.333
One down, two to go.

30:13.416 --> 30:14.750
Next!

30:14.833 --> 30:16.125
[grunts]

30:21.208 --> 30:22.458
[yawns]

30:24.666 --> 30:25.916
Mm-hmm.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.083
[screaming]

30:31.625 --> 30:32.916
[grunts]

30:37.750 --> 30:38.791
[grunts]

30:41.250 --> 30:42.250
How did she...?

30:42.333 --> 30:44.666
The secret is the element of surprise--
[yelps]

30:44.750 --> 30:49.166
[laughs] Bob, two! Cheeky pups, zero!

30:50.083 --> 30:54.208
Now hurry up and fail.
I've got a military-grade nap to get to.

30:54.291 --> 30:58.208
[sighs] A seal is no match for a shark.

30:59.041 --> 31:00.958
That's why we gotta work together.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.666
-Come on, guys.
-Hey! They've had their turn!

31:03.750 --> 31:05.125
You said it yourself.

31:05.208 --> 31:07.875
You can only achieve
your mission with a photo.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.333
I mean, a team.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.166
Three.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.041
Two.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.500
One!

31:20.166 --> 31:24.500
Not bad, pups. Not bad.
Now get some shut-eye.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.000
You're in for more P-A-I-N tomorrow.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.583
-P-A-I-...
-That one just means pain.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.625
[mutters]

31:39.208 --> 31:42.125
[screams]

31:43.458 --> 31:45.791
Bad boy! Bad, bad boy!

31:45.875 --> 31:48.000
[screams, gasps]

31:48.083 --> 31:49.083
Oh.

31:50.833 --> 31:52.041
[sighs]

32:06.125 --> 32:09.291
-What are you doing out here, pup?
-Nothing.

32:09.375 --> 32:12.250
Can't sleep.
Coming up with, uh, strategies.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.458
What are <i>you </i>doing out here?

32:15.916 --> 32:17.375
Same thing.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.041
Is it even possible?

32:22.125 --> 32:23.166
Fighting sharks?

32:23.250 --> 32:26.583
Well, it's stupid
and will probably end in death.

32:26.666 --> 32:29.625
But that never stopped my old team
from diving into action.

32:29.708 --> 32:34.916
Uh, doesn't seem
like that ended super well.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.708
Yeah.

32:36.791 --> 32:38.416
What happened to the rest of your team?

32:39.250 --> 32:43.333
There was an accident,
and HMMF was disbanded.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.458
Dolph went into show business.

32:46.541 --> 32:49.375
And our gear expert, Switch,
he went crazy.

32:49.458 --> 32:51.583
-Gear expert?
-Well, more crazy.

32:51.666 --> 32:53.291
Crazy enough to fight sharks?

32:53.375 --> 32:55.625
Forget it. Not gonna happen, pup.

32:55.708 --> 32:58.708
I already led him on
one starfish-brained mission.

32:58.791 --> 33:00.791
I'm not gonna do it again.

33:01.208 --> 33:04.333
Okay, you leave me no choice, then.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.708
-Hey! Give those back!
-Or what?

33:06.791 --> 33:10.375
Teach me all of your moves?
Military mistake of the century!

33:12.375 --> 33:13.833
[grunts, groans]

33:16.083 --> 33:18.875
I don't get it.
Your old teammates are out there,

33:18.958 --> 33:21.041
but you just sulk here by yourself.

33:22.708 --> 33:25.750
I would do anything to see Benji again.

33:35.583 --> 33:38.666
Pick up the pace!
Stragglers will be left behind!

33:38.750 --> 33:41.625
Then captured.
Then left behind again. Then recaptured.

33:41.708 --> 33:44.250
Then tail-slapped. Then left behind.

33:44.333 --> 33:47.291
Wow, he's particularly hmmf-ish today.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.500
He's just nervous because we're
gonna see an old friend of his.

33:50.583 --> 33:53.916
The Great Geraldo also knows this pain.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.916
When I escaped from the aquarium,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.166
using only my wits
and perfectly symmetrical features,

33:58.250 --> 34:01.750
I had to leave my one true love behind:

34:01.833 --> 34:03.958
Magnificent Jing!

34:04.041 --> 34:07.375
Shut it, seal!
Anything could be listening.

34:07.458 --> 34:10.666
You mean like the biggest shark
you've ever seen in your whole life?

34:27.458 --> 34:30.625
Hi. I'm Dave.

34:30.708 --> 34:33.333
Uh... are you gonna eat us?

34:35.666 --> 34:38.833
Nah. I'm a basking shark.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.625
I only eat plankton.

34:40.708 --> 34:43.833
And one time,
a little wooden boy by mistake.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.291
He really liked to sing.

34:46.375 --> 34:50.625
But that's cool
'cause I really like to sing, too.

34:50.708 --> 34:53.625
My favorite song is the one that goes...

34:53.708 --> 34:58.166
Wah, wah, wah, wah-wah, wah.

34:58.250 --> 34:59.958
What's that one called again?

35:03.083 --> 35:06.333
Wow. There's worse things
a shark can do than eat you.

35:06.416 --> 35:07.750
We're here.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.708
Hold it right there or you're gonna get...

35:29.458 --> 35:30.750
the shrimp.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.833
Hello, Switch.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.625
Claggart? Is that really you?

35:40.583 --> 35:43.666
I haven't seen you since... Boom! Agh!

35:43.750 --> 35:46.208
Yeah, I know.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.083
Oh, Claggy!

35:49.208 --> 35:51.125
It's been too long, my old friend.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.958
It's good to see you, too, Switch.

35:54.041 --> 35:56.458
Sheesh, what's it with you HMMF seals

35:56.541 --> 35:58.291
living alone on spooky wrecks?

35:58.375 --> 36:02.041
Oh, I'm not alone. No, no, no.
I stay with my old friend, Señor Echo.

36:02.875 --> 36:04.583
Is that just your echo?

36:04.666 --> 36:08.041
No! No, he's a sophisticated
but aloof gentleman.

36:08.125 --> 36:11.166
Señor Echo, say, "Hi, everyone!"

36:11.250 --> 36:13.875
[echoes] Hi, everyone!
Everyone! Everyone! Everyone!

36:13.958 --> 36:16.750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you...? Is this...?

36:16.833 --> 36:18.791
Is the HMMF getting back together?

36:18.875 --> 36:20.708
Uh, not quite.

36:20.791 --> 36:22.291
We formed a team to fight sharks.

36:22.375 --> 36:25.416
[lights buzzing]

36:25.500 --> 36:28.250
That's a serious RSI.
Did you tell him that's an RSI?

36:28.333 --> 36:32.000
Kinda why we're here.
We're gonna need some heavy firepower.

36:32.083 --> 36:35.958
Hm. I don't have access
to the HMMF armory anymore.

36:36.791 --> 36:38.458
So I've had to improvise.

36:38.541 --> 36:42.958
With some unstable
experimental biotechnology!

36:43.041 --> 36:45.625
[echoes]
Unstable experimental biotechnology!

36:45.708 --> 36:47.708
Gy-gy-gy!

36:47.791 --> 36:50.250
They know, Señor Echo.
They know, they know. I just told them.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.208
[Señor Echo]
Oh, sorry! My bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!

36:55.375 --> 36:57.416
Clam grenades! Ow!

36:57.500 --> 36:59.208
Oh, excuse... Watch out! Watch out!

37:01.625 --> 37:04.375
Electric eel bolts. Just what you need.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.541
Puffer mines!

37:09.458 --> 37:11.833
Watches! For synchronizing.

37:12.666 --> 37:14.750
Um... what is this?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.666
<i>I love you.</i>

37:16.750 --> 37:17.958
Ugh!

37:18.041 --> 37:19.541
Ooh!

37:19.625 --> 37:21.041
Barazooka!

37:24.000 --> 37:29.083
Yeah. Well, um, that one works,
uh, works better underwater.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.958
And you've already seen the pistol shrimp.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.666
-Ah! He's kinda cute!
-No!

37:36.750 --> 37:39.375
Are you insane? That's one of
the most dangerous weapons here.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.375
One click of his claw and pow!

37:43.125 --> 37:45.458
Anywho, moving swiftly on.

37:45.541 --> 37:49.583
Now this one is super exciting.
This is my latest project.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.000
Activate Octo Suit.

37:53.666 --> 37:56.708
[Echo] Embarrassing!
Embarrassing! Embarrassing!

37:56.791 --> 37:59.875
Oh, sorry. You've gotta do the voice.
They love the voice.

37:59.958 --> 38:02.166

Roger, we're right here!

Can't you just speak normally for once?

-[both] Uh...

43:37.291 --> 43:41.458
We came to tell you we saw
a group of seals attacking a shark?

43:41.541 --> 43:44.291
You got chased away by food?

43:44.375 --> 43:47.375
You don't understand.
They got weird gadgets.

43:56.416 --> 44:00.541
Now, tell me more about these seals.

44:00.625 --> 44:03.500
-Well, they had one of those.
-One of what?

44:03.583 --> 44:07.958
That super awesome-looking shiny thingy.

44:08.041 --> 44:11.083
The food that lived.

44:11.625 --> 44:13.041
This is bad.

44:13.125 --> 44:14.875
For all of us.

44:15.666 --> 44:17.541
First it's seals fighting back.

44:17.625 --> 44:21.041

we'll have penguins pecking at our eyes.

-But they look so friendly.

-A sea otter uprising!

44:28.958 --> 44:32.291

46:14.750 --> 46:18.333
All right, seals,
your next mission is to party!

46:18.416 --> 46:21.083
We took down a shark and didn't die!

46:21.166 --> 46:25.250
-Let's see what you got.

46:25.333 --> 46:28.375

46:42.041 --> 46:43.333
What's wrong, pup?

46:43.416 --> 46:47.958
Moping around in the shadows is
the one move I didn't want to teach you.

46:48.041 --> 46:51.333
Oh, nothing. It's just seeing you guys.

46:51.416 --> 46:53.458
It reminded you of your friend.

46:53.541 --> 46:56.833
Benji wasn't a friend.
He was a TBFITEO.

46:56.916 --> 46:57.916
Oh.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.208
The Best Friend In The Entire Ocean.

47:00.291 --> 47:03.375
See? We'll make a military seal
out of you yet.

47:04.541 --> 47:06.875
Benji was loyal, brave.

47:06.958 --> 47:09.750
Telling me how stupid my ideas were.

47:10.583 --> 47:13.166
Looking out for me, no matter what.

47:13.250 --> 47:16.958
[sighs] That really is a TBFITEO.

47:17.416 --> 47:20.000
And... he paid the price for it.

47:21.500 --> 47:22.666
Sharks!

47:22.750 --> 47:25.250
[screeching]

47:26.041 --> 47:28.208
They've surrounded Seal Island!

47:28.583 --> 47:31.333
Though it could be they just want
a little chit-chat,

47:31.416 --> 47:33.750
but I think you guys
made them really angry.

47:33.833 --> 47:35.375
-Roger.
-[exclaims]

47:35.458 --> 47:37.541
Gear up, team. We're heading out.

47:37.625 --> 47:39.375
That's a serious RSI, pup!

47:39.458 --> 47:41.666
We barely survived a fight with one shark!

47:41.750 --> 47:45.083
If we caused this, we have to fix it.

47:45.166 --> 47:49.291
Not by just rushing in blindly.
That's how you get your friends hurt.

47:50.708 --> 47:52.083
Wait, Quinn, uh...

47:52.166 --> 47:56.041
I'm gonna save those seals,
with or without your help.

47:56.125 --> 47:57.166
Wait, pup.

47:58.041 --> 48:02.375

-No! My canapés!

48:02.458 --> 48:04.166

Quinn! I was talking about me.

48:09.291 --> 48:10.625

48:10.708 --> 48:13.541
The accident that destroyed
the <i>Good Boy...</i>

48:14.833 --> 48:15.958
it was my fault.

48:17.541 --> 48:20.791
I cut the wrong wire on a mine because...

48:22.875 --> 48:24.583
because I'm colorblind!

48:27.916 --> 48:30.583
Um... all seals are colorblind.

48:30.666 --> 48:32.041
-What?
-Uh-huh.

48:32.125 --> 48:34.500
Yeah, for all I know,
our camouflage could be bright pink.

48:34.583 --> 48:38.666
Oh, man. I gotta rethink everything.

48:38.750 --> 48:40.958
You sure? Whoo!

48:41.041 --> 48:44.333
[breathes heavily] Brrr!

48:44.416 --> 48:47.291
All right, all right, all right. [exhales]

48:47.375 --> 48:48.375
I'm okay.

48:48.458 --> 48:50.458
Ah! I threw my life away!

48:51.083 --> 48:54.291
[screams]
It's ruined everything!

48:54.375 --> 48:56.000
Whew. [pants]

48:56.083 --> 48:57.500
Pull it together.

48:57.583 --> 49:00.583
The point is I was proud, overconfident.

49:00.666 --> 49:02.375
And I rushed in without thinking.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.708
My crew... my friends...
they paid the price.

49:07.791 --> 49:10.416
Ah, come on.
It's water under the exploded bridge.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.416
We all make mistakes, right?

49:12.500 --> 49:15.250
But you don't have
to make the same ones I did.

49:16.125 --> 49:18.666
So, what do we do?

49:18.750 --> 49:22.041
The seals are trapped over here
on Sentinel Rock.

49:22.125 --> 49:25.000
There are sharks
here, here, here, here, here.

49:25.083 --> 49:27.875
Little bit over here.
This one, no, don't go there.

49:27.958 --> 49:29.583
There's a shark here, here, here.

49:29.666 --> 49:32.666
There was a baby shark over here.
Doo-doo-doo-doo.

49:32.750 --> 49:35.083
Uh, Mommy shark here.
Yep, a shark here.

49:35.166 --> 49:37.833
Grandpa shark over here.
He did not look very happy.

49:37.916 --> 49:39.541
-There was a shark--
-Okay, we get it!

49:39.625 --> 49:41.958
We got eight hours
before the tide comes in.

49:42.041 --> 49:45.000
We need to rescue those seals
without engaging the sharks.

49:45.083 --> 49:46.708
Sounds like a job for the...

49:46.791 --> 49:48.583
[deep voice] Octo Suit.

49:50.541 --> 49:52.166
Yeah, probably an RSI.

49:52.250 --> 49:54.500
I think I have something else
that could work!

49:57.333 --> 49:59.250

49:59.333 --> 50:03.000
Irresistible for sharks. One drop
will lure them all away from the island.

50:03.083 --> 50:05.291
The sharks are gonna be on us
as soon as we put that stuff in the water.

50:05.375 --> 50:06.833
We need a boat.

50:06.916 --> 50:08.750
Not this boat, though, right?

50:08.833 --> 50:11.166
-Hey, the <i>Good Boy </i>can still sail.

50:11.958 --> 50:14.791

or in our hearts and minds?

50:14.875 --> 50:18.166
The Great Geraldo
knows where we can get a boat.

50:18.250 --> 50:20.916
The harbor near my old aquarium.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.708
It's the last place I saw my great love,
the Magnificent Jing,

50:24.791 --> 50:26.750
before I escaped using only my wits.

50:26.833 --> 50:28.291
All right! We've got our plan.

50:28.375 --> 50:30.958
Get a boat, chum the water,
and rescue the seals.

-Locals only!

51:16.583 --> 51:19.875
-Get lost, bruh.
-Hmmf. Harbor seals.

51:19.958 --> 51:21.291
No honor, no bravery.

51:21.375 --> 51:23.708
They just laze around
doing tricks for snacks.

51:23.791 --> 51:27.708
You think you can just roll
into our territory and insult us?

51:27.791 --> 51:28.875
We'll show you.

51:30.125 --> 51:31.166

51:31.250 --> 51:32.875

51:32.958 --> 51:36.208

Uh, who's the Harbor Queen?

51:39.166 --> 51:41.500

but she sounds kinda dangerous.

51:48.083 --> 51:50.416

51:53.041 --> 51:56.791

Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.

52:19.791 --> 52:21.416
Report back to Grimes.

52:32.500 --> 52:36.458
Yes. Tell her to join
the attack from the north.

52:37.041 --> 52:39.000
[whispering]

52:39.083 --> 52:41.750
Huh? What do you mean he's lost?

52:41.833 --> 52:44.208
Sharks have a built-in navigation system.

52:45.125 --> 52:48.625
[sighs] Fine. Left at the reef,
right at the canyon.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.583
And he can't miss it. [grunts]

52:51.541 --> 52:55.625
If you give me bad news,
I will eat you right now.

52:57.708 --> 52:59.416
[sighs] Just spit it out already.

52:59.500 --> 53:00.625
[spits]

53:00.708 --> 53:01.875
The news!

53:01.958 --> 53:06.375
The tide's almost up, but still
no sign of them pesky action seals.

53:06.458 --> 53:07.458
Doesn't matter.

53:07.541 --> 53:12.208
As long as they stay out of my way,
the plan will proceed.

53:12.291 --> 53:14.208
And if they do show up?

53:14.291 --> 53:17.250
Save a bite of the cheeky one for me.

53:20.166 --> 53:23.166
No! Right at the reef! Right!

53:24.083 --> 53:25.583

You useless, good-for-nothing,
self-involved coward!

53:31.208 --> 53:34.666
Hold up, is this <i>the </i>Jing?
The one who escaped from the aquarium?

53:34.750 --> 53:37.791
[all] "Using only his wits
and perfectly symmetrical features."

53:38.500 --> 53:39.500
"Escaped"?

53:40.291 --> 53:42.083
The Magnificent Jing laughs

53:42.166 --> 53:45.083
with all the sarcasm she can muster.

53:45.166 --> 53:48.708
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

53:48.791 --> 53:51.666
The Great Geraldo notes your sarcasm,
but does not appreciate it.

53:51.750 --> 53:55.041
Ugh. Two of them. Help me.

53:55.125 --> 53:57.500
Please, my love,
we do not have time for this.

53:57.583 --> 54:00.916
No one is going anywhere
until he tells the truth.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.958
-I...
-Please be dramatic.

54:04.041 --> 54:04.958
I...

54:07.166 --> 54:10.708
Escaping the aquarium was Jing's plan.

54:11.458 --> 54:15.250
-But I... I couldn't go through with it!
-[all gasp]

54:15.333 --> 54:17.458

as that is to believe,

smart, and symmetrically featured,

54:34.166 --> 54:36.333
how did you escape the aquarium?

54:37.333 --> 54:39.000
I was thrown out.

54:39.583 --> 54:43.333
Without the Magnificent Jing,
our show was an absolute failure.

1:00:42.791 --> 1:00:45.625
Oh, and Grimes is just getting started.

1:00:45.708 --> 1:00:49.000
Surrounding Seal Island was
just a distraction to keep you busy.

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:50.833
Shut up, you sellout!

1:00:50.916 --> 1:00:53.500
Yeah! Snitches get eaten!

1:00:56.625 --> 1:00:58.041
[yelps, screams]

1:00:58.125 --> 1:01:00.416
We need to find out
what Grimes is up to.

1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:02.958
Without those sharks warning him
that we're coming.

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:09.000
I think I have a plan.

1:01:14.791 --> 1:01:15.875
Huh?

1:01:23.333 --> 1:01:24.375
[whimpers]

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:28.208
Hm.

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.375
[shrieks]

1:01:35.041 --> 1:01:37.041
Are seals meant to do that?

1:01:37.125 --> 1:01:39.250
Only after we bite them.

1:01:40.708 --> 1:01:41.916
Uh...

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:48.833
Well, I am hanging my head
at an unnatural angle,

1:01:48.916 --> 1:01:51.625
uh, out of deep regret.

1:01:51.708 --> 1:01:55.208
I, the Great Geraldo love you, Jing.

1:01:55.291 --> 1:01:57.333
Go, go! We'll keep them busy!

1:01:57.416 --> 1:01:59.125
What do you mean "we?"

1:01:59.208 --> 1:02:02.416
We always worked better as a duet, right?

1:02:03.625 --> 1:02:05.000
[groans]

1:02:05.083 --> 1:02:07.083
What a shock.

1:02:07.166 --> 1:02:11.333
I, the Magnificent Jing,
did not expect this!

1:02:11.416 --> 1:02:13.375
[piano music playing]

1:02:13.458 --> 1:02:17.250
But I, Quinn, also love Jing!

1:02:17.333 --> 1:02:18.708
[gasps] How dare you!

1:02:18.791 --> 1:02:20.416
Ooh!

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:25.291
How will I ever decide
between these two eligible seals?

1:02:26.916 --> 1:02:30.500
-Choose Geraldo!
-Jerk? He doesn't deserve her!

1:02:59.958 --> 1:03:03.041
[shouts] My buddy
Sydney Six Fins knows the name!

1:03:03.125 --> 1:03:06.041
The funny thing with Sydney Six Fins

1:03:06.125 --> 1:03:09.375
is all sharks have six fins!

1:03:09.458 --> 1:03:12.166
Why, unless you count the, uh...

1:03:12.250 --> 1:03:14.458
you know, uh...

1:03:16.708 --> 1:03:19.500
the butt fin! Then it's seven!

1:03:19.583 --> 1:03:22.125
That reminds me of a joke.

1:03:22.208 --> 1:03:25.083
Why is six afraid of seven?

1:03:25.166 --> 1:03:26.333
Whoa, whoa.

1:03:26.416 --> 1:03:27.708
I wish I knew.

1:03:27.791 --> 1:03:31.000
Sharks have no concept of arithmetic.

1:03:31.083 --> 1:03:33.000
Whoa, whoa! [speaks gibberish]

1:03:33.083 --> 1:03:35.125
[shouts] All of the evasive maneuvers!

1:03:35.208 --> 1:03:36.375
-Shark!
-Retreat! Retreat!

1:03:42.375 --> 1:03:43.375
Hm!

1:03:46.125 --> 1:03:50.125
-Now, where were we?
-Split up!

1:04:02.333 --> 1:04:03.541
[grunts]

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:09.125
You remember when I said I'd eat you last?

1:04:09.666 --> 1:04:11.250
I lied!

1:04:12.916 --> 1:04:17.458
One move,
and you're gonna get the shrimp.

1:04:19.916 --> 1:04:21.166
What you gonna do?

1:04:21.250 --> 1:04:22.958
Merchandising opportunity me to death?

1:04:26.583 --> 1:04:27.666
[slow-motion groans]

1:04:31.083 --> 1:04:32.833
[Geraldo, imitating Claggart]
I have a terrible secret

1:04:32.916 --> 1:04:34.916
that I have never told anyone.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.916
I, Claggart,

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.250
am in fact Switch's father's
twin's evil son!

1:04:42.125 --> 1:04:44.333
Wouldn't that be his evil cous...?

1:04:44.416 --> 1:04:45.375
Shh!

1:04:45.458 --> 1:04:47.791
[chuckling]

1:04:49.666 --> 1:04:53.291
Not coming with you was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1:04:53.375 --> 1:04:55.958
-Oh! Back story!
-Finally!

1:04:56.041 --> 1:04:58.791
Well, you are a liar, a coward,

1:04:58.875 --> 1:05:01.291
a proud, boastful, son-of-a-walrus.

1:05:02.375 --> 1:05:04.875
But we are better as a duet.

1:05:05.833 --> 1:05:09.041
-Kiss him already!
-Not with you creeps watching!

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.708
She's gonna do it. She's gonna do it!

1:05:17.666 --> 1:05:19.083
Come on. Let's go.

1:05:19.166 --> 1:05:22.333
The Great Geraldo
was definitely in on that plan.

1:05:24.583 --> 1:05:28.125
Are those really the most
deadly creatures in the ocean?

1:05:28.208 --> 1:05:30.875
Not when you're around, my love.

1:05:33.375 --> 1:05:35.708
[chuckle]

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:44.041
[distorted] Quinn!

1:05:45.541 --> 1:05:47.333
[distorted] Quinn!

1:05:47.416 --> 1:05:48.916
Quinn!

1:05:55.958 --> 1:05:57.375
[groans]

1:06:06.541 --> 1:06:09.583
A puny shark is no match for the...

1:06:14.541 --> 1:06:16.791
-The Great Geral...
-[sighs]

1:06:24.541 --> 1:06:26.666
What are they doing down there?

1:06:26.750 --> 1:06:30.041
Hmmf, no way we're gonna get close enough

1:06:30.125 --> 1:06:32.041
to hear without being spotted.

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:34.875
Uh, guys? This kind of
maybe sort of seems like

1:06:34.958 --> 1:06:37.375
a job for the... Octo Suit?

1:06:37.458 --> 1:06:39.625
[sighs] He's right.

1:06:39.708 --> 1:06:41.166
-Wait, what?
-Are you insane?

1:06:41.250 --> 1:06:43.875
-Really?
-You think Flicka can hold it together?

1:06:43.958 --> 1:06:46.416
Yes! Ish...

1:06:47.333 --> 1:06:49.833
And if things get a little, uh, colorful,

1:06:49.916 --> 1:06:52.125
just say, "Activate countermeasures."

1:06:52.208 --> 1:06:55.166
-They'll know what to do.
-Then let's do this.

1:06:56.291 --> 1:06:57.750
[excited chittering]

1:07:32.750 --> 1:07:35.333
-[whimpering]
-We can do this, Flicka.

1:07:36.625 --> 1:07:38.750
I was minding my own business

1:07:38.833 --> 1:07:41.875
when this tornado
lifts me out of the water.

1:07:41.958 --> 1:07:44.333
-Yeah, I heard about that.
-Shh, shh.

1:07:44.416 --> 1:07:46.291
Brothers and sisters.

1:07:46.375 --> 1:07:50.625
I have invited you here
because of the seal menace.

1:07:50.708 --> 1:07:52.916
[booing]

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.666
I hate them so much!

1:07:54.750 --> 1:07:58.166
I mean, do they live on land or in water?

1:07:58.250 --> 1:08:02.875
But I know how to turn this
problem into an opportunity.

1:08:02.958 --> 1:08:05.625
We can learn something from those seals.

1:08:05.708 --> 1:08:08.166
-Better PR with humans!
-Or to drive a speedboat?

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:09.500
How to do a thumbs up?

1:08:09.583 --> 1:08:11.333
[sighs] Teamwork.

1:08:12.125 --> 1:08:13.375
Hm.

1:08:13.458 --> 1:08:15.250
If a group of floating lunchboxes

1:08:15.333 --> 1:08:17.250
can band together and threaten us,

1:08:17.333 --> 1:08:19.458
imagine what we can achieve together.

1:08:19.541 --> 1:08:22.291
-Shark legs!
-Then we'll be the mammals!

1:08:22.375 --> 1:08:24.458
You know what? The next time
anyone wants to speak,

1:08:24.541 --> 1:08:25.958
raise your fin.

1:08:26.041 --> 1:08:27.041
Now where was I?

1:08:27.125 --> 1:08:30.333
Every year,
seals head out for the sardine run.

1:08:30.416 --> 1:08:33.791
And every year, we eat our fill.
Who do we catch?

1:08:33.875 --> 1:08:35.208
The old, the slow,

1:08:35.291 --> 1:08:38.416
and that weird-tasting seal
that's frothing at the mouth.

1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:41.166
-Ew, gross!
-That guy's the worst flavor!

1:08:41.250 --> 1:08:42.833
Hey! What did I just say?

1:08:43.791 --> 1:08:47.916
But as a team we'll make sure
no seal is left behind.

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:50.625
Because we'll eat them all!

1:08:53.333 --> 1:08:54.916
[sighs] Yes?

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:56.541
Could I eat two seals?

1:08:56.625 --> 1:08:58.041
More.

1:08:58.125 --> 1:08:59.500
Five seals?

1:08:59.583 --> 1:09:00.625
More!

1:09:00.708 --> 1:09:02.166
Seven seals?

1:09:02.250 --> 1:09:05.250
You will eat as many seals
as you can count!

1:09:05.333 --> 1:09:08.041
Huh, huh, huh. Seven seals!

1:09:08.125 --> 1:09:11.041
[cheering]

1:09:16.666 --> 1:09:19.333
Uh, Guys?
We have a little problem.

1:09:19.875 --> 1:09:22.416
-[grunts]
-Eat seals for breakfast.

1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:24.833
Seals for second breakfast.

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:27.000
Seals for elevenses.

1:09:27.083 --> 1:09:29.000
Seals for luncheon.

1:09:29.083 --> 1:09:31.583
-Seals for afternoon tea!
-[squeals]

1:09:31.666 --> 1:09:33.208
-Seals for dinner!
-Hm.

1:09:33.291 --> 1:09:35.291
Seals for supper.

1:09:35.375 --> 1:09:37.083
Seals, seals, seals!

1:09:37.166 --> 1:09:38.750
[chittering]

1:09:38.833 --> 1:09:42.041
Hold it together, guys.
Just a little bit longer!

1:09:42.625 --> 1:09:44.666
Let me out! He's over here!

1:09:50.666 --> 1:09:52.666
[whirring]

1:09:59.916 --> 1:10:01.000
Uh...

1:10:01.083 --> 1:10:02.916
Activate countermeasures?

1:10:04.041 --> 1:10:05.750
Oh, right, I gotta do the voice.

1:10:05.833 --> 1:10:07.916
[deep voice]
Activate countermeasures!

1:10:33.041 --> 1:10:35.166
[Grimes]
Hello there, little fella.

1:10:36.875 --> 1:10:39.125
You're a bit early for the feast,

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:41.958
but I can always have a pre-dinner snack.

1:10:42.041 --> 1:10:43.958
Yeah, I get that.
You must be pretty hungry

1:10:44.041 --> 1:10:47.541
after monologuing for, like, seven hours.

1:10:47.666 --> 1:10:49.416
How do you guys deal with the boredom?

1:10:49.500 --> 1:10:51.250
Staring into the distance.

1:10:51.333 --> 1:10:52.750
I do crossword puzzles.

1:10:52.833 --> 1:10:54.291
Plotting betrayal, mostly.

1:10:54.375 --> 1:10:56.250
First, I'm gonna stop you.

1:10:56.333 --> 1:10:59.625
Then I'm gonna tail-slap
that stupid smile right off your face!

<i>We're </i>gonna tail slap
that stupid smile off your face!

1:11:08.583 --> 1:11:12.083
Ooh! You brought me more friends to eat.

1:11:12.166 --> 1:11:15.833
But you're not the only ones
with reinforcements.

1:11:22.250 --> 1:11:23.500
Any ideas?

1:11:25.291 --> 1:11:27.625
Get outta here. I'll keep 'em busy.

1:11:27.708 --> 1:11:30.708
[chuckles] I thought I was
the one with the stupid plans.

1:11:34.750 --> 1:11:37.583
Uh-uh. No. Forget it. No way.

1:11:37.666 --> 1:11:39.166
Listen to me, pup.

1:11:39.250 --> 1:11:42.250
When we met, I was an empty wreck.

1:11:42.875 --> 1:11:44.583
I'd given up on everything.

1:11:45.916 --> 1:11:47.083
But you.

1:11:47.166 --> 1:11:51.291
You're crazy, stupid and brave enough
to never surrender.

1:11:51.666 --> 1:11:54.583
You'll always be there for your friends.

1:11:55.208 --> 1:11:57.208
That's why you gotta get out of here.

1:11:57.291 --> 1:12:01.250
No! Please! [sighs] I can't.

1:12:01.333 --> 1:12:05.708
I believe in you, pup.
You are natural-born HMMF.

1:12:06.291 --> 1:12:07.333
Come on!

1:12:07.416 --> 1:12:08.750
[laughs]

1:12:14.666 --> 1:12:16.666
No! I'm never leaving him!

1:12:16.750 --> 1:12:19.833
If we stay here, we're all done for!

1:12:19.916 --> 1:12:23.000
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1:12:23.083 --> 1:12:25.958
You're gonna have
an honorary doctorate in pain!

Quinn, where you going?

1:12:56.875 --> 1:12:59.708
The sharks are planning an ambush
during the sardine run.

1:12:59.791 --> 1:13:01.583
I need to warn everyone.

1:13:01.666 --> 1:13:02.750
What's the plan?

1:13:04.916 --> 1:13:05.916
There isn't one.

1:13:07.791 --> 1:13:10.541
Everyone keeps paying for my stupid ideas.

All right, Team Beth!

We're gonna find
a way to stop those sharks!

We've gotta stop them.
The sharks are waiting.

-They're what?
-[shouts] The sharks!

1:14:14.541 --> 1:14:16.708
Hm. Never heard of them.

There are sharks out there.

1:14:27.125 --> 1:14:30.625
-Really?
-You know why I don't admit it?

1:14:31.833 --> 1:14:34.375
Out there you might not come back.

1:14:34.458 --> 1:14:36.708
I might not come back.

1:14:37.416 --> 1:14:39.875
But the community will survive.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.958
If we don't go on the sardine run,
everyone will starve.

1:14:47.833 --> 1:14:49.833
[thunderclap]

1:15:02.750 --> 1:15:04.916
[all] All hail Bob!

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:10.458
All hail Bob!

1:15:10.541 --> 1:15:12.583
Um...

1:15:12.666 --> 1:15:13.708
Quinn! Thank goodness!

1:15:13.791 --> 1:15:17.541
Oh, things got out of hand,
so quickly without you!

1:15:17.625 --> 1:15:20.500
We were training with Bob, and
next thing I knew, he had taken over!

1:15:20.583 --> 1:15:22.916
Bob... can be very persuasive.

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.333
Why did you come back?

1:15:25.791 --> 1:15:28.416
The seals have already left
for the sardine run.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:30.000
Gotta try to protect them.

1:15:31.208 --> 1:15:32.750
-Is there anyone here...?
-Brave.

1:15:32.833 --> 1:15:33.833
-Stupid.
-Crazy.

1:15:33.916 --> 1:15:35.083
Let's do this.

1:15:44.416 --> 1:15:45.833
The seals have a head start.

1:15:47.791 --> 1:15:51.666
-The sharks! They're gone.
-What do you mean "gone"?

1:15:51.750 --> 1:15:53.791
-AWOL, Roger.
-What they said.

1:15:54.916 --> 1:15:56.083
Here's the island.

1:15:57.166 --> 1:15:59.000
This is where the sardines will come past.

1:15:59.083 --> 1:16:03.916
-But there's nothing in between.
-[gasps] Except for...

1:16:28.916 --> 1:16:31.625
I can't stand that guy. So boring.

1:16:31.708 --> 1:16:34.083
Whatever you do, don't make eye contact.

1:16:39.791 --> 1:16:43.583
Uh... I thought the point of this thing
was to not get eaten by sharks?

1:16:43.666 --> 1:16:47.791
-Actually, I only eat plankton.
-[all] We know!

1:16:59.458 --> 1:17:02.333
Thanks, Dave!
You're the best shark I've met.

1:17:04.375 --> 1:17:07.500
No problem!

1:17:08.375 --> 1:17:10.625
-Team Quinn!
-Please! Team Geraldo!

1:17:10.708 --> 1:17:11.958
-Uh-uh. Quinn.
-Geraldo.

1:17:12.041 --> 1:17:13.083
-Quinn.
-Geraldo.

1:17:13.166 --> 1:17:14.083
-Quinn.
-Quinn.

1:17:14.166 --> 1:17:15.083
-Quinn.
-Geraldo.

1:17:15.166 --> 1:17:16.125
-What?
-Huh?

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:21.166
-Team Jing!
-Oh! That's gonna leave a mark.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.416
[watch] <i>I love you.</i>

1:17:26.666 --> 1:17:29.166
<i>I love you.</i>

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.458
<i>I love you.</i>

1:17:34.541 --> 1:17:35.791
<i>Look behind you.</i>

1:17:36.416 --> 1:17:37.833
[laughs]

1:17:41.166 --> 1:17:43.125
I really loved that watch.

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.125
[water bubbling]

1:18:04.458 --> 1:18:08.458
[Geraldo] I'm beginning to think
this mission is a serious RSI.

1:18:09.666 --> 1:18:12.750
-I'm hungry.
-Can we eat yet?

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:15.625
-It's so cramped in here.
-Yeah!

1:18:15.708 --> 1:18:18.458
We're packed like some kind of fish.

1:18:18.541 --> 1:18:20.458
[overlapping chatter]

1:18:20.541 --> 1:18:22.458
-Come on. Let's go.
-Quiet.

1:18:22.541 --> 1:18:25.250
-Silence.
-Shut your face-holes!

1:18:25.333 --> 1:18:28.208
Patience, brothers and sisters.

1:18:28.291 --> 1:18:31.666
We wait for the tasty seals
to pass overhead.

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:34.666
And then, when they're
cut off from the island...

1:18:34.750 --> 1:18:37.041
[sniffs] ...we attack.

1:18:38.083 --> 1:18:42.458
This year, no one's coming back
from the sardine run.

1:18:45.791 --> 1:18:47.250
Hm.

1:18:50.041 --> 1:18:51.208
I think I have an idea.

1:18:51.750 --> 1:18:54.583
Switch, can you release that container?

1:18:54.666 --> 1:18:57.791
Even if I have to break
the chain with my teeth. Ah.

1:18:59.208 --> 1:19:01.916
The rest of you,
position yourselves at the exits.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:05.333
As soon as that crate
comes down, close the doors.

1:19:05.416 --> 1:19:08.208
-[clanking, door closes]
-[gasps]

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.541

1:19:13.625 --> 1:19:15.750
[cheering]

1:19:16.041 --> 1:19:18.666
Please?! Why do you hate me?

1:19:18.750 --> 1:19:20.583
[grunts]

1:19:22.208 --> 1:19:24.208
[groans]

1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:42.708

1:19:42.791 --> 1:19:44.291
Move. Move!

1:19:44.375 --> 1:19:46.208
Sorry, sorry.

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000
[snaps teeth]

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:54.750
Go, my love.

1:19:54.833 --> 1:19:56.666
No ways.

1:19:56.750 --> 1:20:00.625
I have spent my whole life
proclaiming my bravery

1:20:00.708 --> 1:20:04.708
but being a coward when it really counts.

1:20:04.791 --> 1:20:06.083
[shouts] Not today!

1:20:06.166 --> 1:20:10.083
If you don't come back, I will find you.

1:20:10.166 --> 1:20:11.875
And I will hurt you!

1:20:11.958 --> 1:20:14.833
I wouldn't expect any less, my love.

1:20:19.333 --> 1:20:22.750
[grunts] This puny door

1:20:22.833 --> 1:20:26.708
is no match for the Great Geraldo!

1:20:29.583 --> 1:20:30.958
Sorry, my friends.

1:20:37.416 --> 1:20:38.541
[gasping]

1:20:46.250 --> 1:20:47.916

1:20:52.166 --> 1:20:54.166
-This way!
-Not this way!

1:20:56.083 --> 1:20:57.291
[roars]

1:21:14.458 --> 1:21:17.666
Why, hello there, little fellas.

1:21:17.750 --> 1:21:19.708
Shut it, you creep!

1:21:19.791 --> 1:21:22.791
Why always the eyes? [grunts]

1:21:22.875 --> 1:21:26.458
First, I'm gonna eat
every seal you've ever met.

1:21:26.541 --> 1:21:28.958
Then I'll be back for you.

1:21:29.916 --> 1:21:31.916
[chuckling]

1:21:42.791 --> 1:21:44.791
[screaming]

1:21:51.750 --> 1:21:53.208
No! No!

1:21:53.875 --> 1:21:55.083
No.

1:21:56.541 --> 1:21:57.708
[sighs]

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:00.875
It's over, isn't it?

1:22:01.916 --> 1:22:03.458
[sighs]

1:22:03.541 --> 1:22:05.000
For all of us.

1:22:05.083 --> 1:22:06.708
Well, this mission did have

1:22:06.791 --> 1:22:10.208
that classic, uh,
certain death-y kind of feel to it.

1:22:11.208 --> 1:22:13.458
[sniffs] Then why'd you come?

1:22:13.541 --> 1:22:16.458
Because of you, dummy.

1:22:18.625 --> 1:22:23.041
My whole life I believed that it was
every Beth for themselves.

1:22:23.125 --> 1:22:27.875
Then some starfish-brained idiot
showed me another way.

1:22:27.958 --> 1:22:31.791
A very stupid way. But a better way.

1:22:32.833 --> 1:22:36.416
[chuckles]
We gotta look out for each other.

1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:38.625
-No...
-Matter...

1:22:38.708 --> 1:22:41.541
What? Oh, oh! What.

1:22:42.208 --> 1:22:43.166
Come on.

1:22:43.250 --> 1:22:46.666
Let's see if we can take down
a few of those sharks with us.

1:22:46.750 --> 1:22:48.166
[grunts]

1:22:49.333 --> 1:22:51.000
[grunting]

1:22:51.833 --> 1:22:55.291
Told you a puny door is
no match for the Great Geraldo.

1:22:55.958 --> 1:22:57.708
[muffled] Whoo-hoo!

1:22:57.791 --> 1:22:59.333
Why are we swimming?

-Roger, Roger!

Roger!

1:23:55.166 --> 1:23:59.333
Yeee-haw! Yeah, okay, maybe
I shouldn't have done this!

1:24:02.375 --> 1:24:03.625
Ow!

1:24:04.625 --> 1:24:05.541
Ooh!

1:24:11.333 --> 1:24:13.333
Prepare to be astounded.

1:24:13.416 --> 1:24:15.541
Prepare to be amazed.

1:24:15.625 --> 1:24:17.833
Prepare to have your fins handed to you!

1:24:17.916 --> 1:24:20.333
By the Great Geraldo!

1:24:20.416 --> 1:24:23.625
And the Magnificent Jing! [chuckles]

1:25:16.250 --> 1:25:17.500

1:25:34.708 --> 1:25:36.166
You're surrounded.

You're outnumbered.

You're about to be food.

1:25:39.916 --> 1:25:44.041
Give it up, little fella. You can't win.

1:25:44.125 --> 1:25:46.666
[sighs] I know.

1:25:46.750 --> 1:25:50.458
But we're brave, stupid
and crazy enough to try anyway.

1:26:03.375 --> 1:26:06.666
Sorry I'm late.
I had to fetch reinforcements.

Come on, everybody. Let's help them.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.291
Yeah!

Are you guys with me?
Are you with me?

-Yeah! [comical gibberish]

Psst! I wouldn't go there if I was you!

The island is
under Seal Team's protection.

Yuh-huh.

Wow. That guy is so done for.

Yup. Quinn's gonna kick his tailfin.

[screams] It worked better on paper!

1:29:41.708 --> 1:29:45.625
