01:18.245 --> 01:19.437
Claude.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.557
Put these clothes on.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.767
Take only the back roads.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.410
The Germans are coming from the
east, so head south to Brussels.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.192
- Yes, Father.
- God be with you, Claude.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.064
Champagne... very nice.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.562
You must join me, Doctor Stahl.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.525
- Get another glass.
- With pleasure.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.406
Claire?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.787
We need another champagne glass.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.106
It's for Stahl.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.072
This one... and this one...

04:20.844 --> 04:22.571
to Carinhall.

04:30.228 --> 04:36.381
And this will be a present for
the Fuhrer in Berchtesgaden.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.426
What else, Doctor Stahl?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.830
This is da Vinci's <i>Last Supper.</i>

05:10.477 --> 05:14.753
The British bombers leveled
three walls and a roof.

05:15.732 --> 05:20.178
This is Monte Cassino, founded
in 529 by Saint Benedict.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.930
This is in February.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.637
This is Monte Cassino in March,

05:24.699 --> 05:29.350
after we dropped 20 tons
of explosives on it.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.809
Mr. President, the simple fact is
that we are at a point in this war

05:33.875 --> 05:38.151
that is most dangerous to the greatest
historical achievements known to man.

05:38.213 --> 05:42.363
But, Professor Stokes,
understand that this is war.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.243
And that lives are lost,

05:44.302 --> 05:47.997
and with them, oftentimes,
their greatest achievements.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.784
Yes, sir. There's something more.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.080
This is the <i>Ghent Altarpiece.</i>

05:55.730 --> 05:58.629
It is the defining monument
of the Catholic Church.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.262
We now know that the
Nazis have stolen it.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.139
Now, while we must and we
will, sir, win this war,

06:05.198 --> 06:08.552
we should also remember the
high price that will be paid

06:08.618 --> 06:12.097
if the very foundation of
modern society is destroyed.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.562
Let's look at where we are now.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.237
The Russians are here.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.569
The Allies are here

06:21.631 --> 06:23.608
and here.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.871
In the next few months, God willing,
we are all going to end up in Berlin.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.578
Meaning that we will have
blasted our way west,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.869
through Poland, through
Hungary, through Austria,

06:33.935 --> 06:38.290
north through Rome and Florence,

06:38.982 --> 06:42.336
and east through Paris.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.175
Then the question must be asked:

06:45.655 --> 06:49.851
Who would make sure that the
<i>Statue of David</i> is still standing,

06:50.452 --> 06:52.975
or that <i>Mona Lisa's</i> still smiling?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.769
Who would be their protectors?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.778
Well, professor, it's a
very compelling argument.

06:59.836 --> 07:00.983
What would you suggest?

07:01.963 --> 07:04.782
<i>I suggest you pull together
young art scholars</i>

07:04.841 --> 07:08.036
<i>to get over there and
identify the great works.</i>

07:08.094 --> 07:11.164
<i>Our young art scholars are
already over there fighting.</i>

07:12.557 --> 07:14.500
<i>You have a family?</i>

07:14.559 --> 07:17.253
<i>I have a wife and a young son.</i>

07:18.480 --> 07:20.878
<i>I might be asking a great
deal of you, then.</i>

07:22.317 --> 07:24.090
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

07:35.914 --> 07:38.984
There's a Michelangelo
joke to be made.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.983
You're just the man to make it.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.692
You hungry?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.152
You buying?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.113
Uncle Sam is.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.709
<i>- How's Penny?
- She's swell.</i>

08:00.772 --> 08:04.217
- I do question her taste.
- So does she.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.093
How's the ticker?

08:06.569 --> 08:08.012
Still ticking.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.265
Want to get in the war?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.184
"The Monuments Men."

08:14.244 --> 08:16.472
- Signed by Roosevelt.
- I see that.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.812
I'm to put a team together and
try to protect what's left,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.521
and find what's missing.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.528
- Aren't you a little old for that?
- Yes.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.321
You want to go into a war
zone and tell our boys

08:28.383 --> 08:31.532
- what they can and cannot blow up.
- That's the idea.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.243
- Okay. How many men?
- For now, six.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.952
- Jesus.
- Mm.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.619
- With you, that's seven.
- That's much better.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.380
We'll go through basic in Shrivenham,
England, then wait for orders.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.664
- Basic?
- Mm-hm.

08:43.732 --> 08:47.086
Basic training. Us?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.388
Oh, boy.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.925
You're gonna need a
point man in England.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.093
- Yeah, Donald Jeffries.
- He's a drunk.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.604
- You're a drunk.
- That's true. Pass me that.

08:57.662 --> 09:01.016
- But isn't Donald Jeffries in jail?
- No, he didn't go to jail.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.150
- His father paid the money back.
- Mm.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.437
How about his wife?
Did she stick it out?

09:05.503 --> 09:07.605
No, nobody stuck it out.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.327
So when do we start?

11:49.334 --> 11:52.404
- Good to see you! Frank. James.
- Donald.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.156
The chaps are all very
anxious to get started.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.818
You're a lieutenant?
They are getting desperate.

11:57.884 --> 12:01.284
Don't let Churchill hear that.
James, how's your lovely wife?

12:01.346 --> 12:04.791
Fine. She told me to send you a
kiss, which I won't deliver.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.747
- I'll just shake.
- You usually do.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.586
Not anymore. I'm on the wagon.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.418
- Since when?
- Nine this morning.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.048
Congratulations.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.287
Thank you, private.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.589
This is Private Epstein,
from New Jersey.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.152
You don't say. Whereabouts?

12:17.153 --> 12:19.631
Newark. But really the north side.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.925
- Of Newark?
- Yes, sir. The north side.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.809
- That's what I thought.
- Indeed.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.312
- I was born in Germany.
- The north side.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.315
- How are the fellas making out?
- Like Olympians.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.521
Yes, sir.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.654
We have your architect from
Chicago, Sergeant Richard Campbell.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.032
And we have a Frenchman,
Lieutenant Jean-Claude Clermont,

12:38.091 --> 12:42.446
director of design at the Chalet
School of Fine Arts before the war.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.824
- Is Preston here?
- Private Preston Savitz.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.791
Private? That won't
sit well with him.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.293
It doesn't.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.378
Finally we have your sculptor,
Sergeant Walter Garfield.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.214
He's a good egg. I worked with
him on the World War I memorial

12:57.277 --> 12:58.629
- in St. Louis.
- Uh-huh.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.547
Hey, Stokes!

13:02.532 --> 13:03.975
How are you, old boy?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.811
Hey, Walter. How are
they treating you?

13:06.869 --> 13:11.190
Been taking it pretty easy on us.
I think they feel sorry for us old guys.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.272
I don't much fancy
an obstacle course.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.526
It's not so bad.

13:14.585 --> 13:18.861
You're just crawling on your belly while
teenagers shoot blanks over your head.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.616
Well, yes and no.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.869
- How's that?
- Yes, they are teenagers.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.155
- And no?
- They're not blanks.

13:26.556 --> 13:30.286
We're meeting up after mess.
Let the other chaps know, will you?

13:30.351 --> 13:32.954
Try not to get shot
in the meantime.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.593
<i>I'm guessing you have all gotten
to know each other by now.</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:40.424
Basic training will do that.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.590
You've been selected by myself
and Lieutenant Jeffries

13:43.656 --> 13:46.054
because we need your
knowledge and skill.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.016
We have been tasked
to find and protect

13:49.078 --> 13:52.307
buildings, monuments, and art.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.475
Private, will you get those lights?

13:56.085 --> 13:59.189
Did you know they were shooting
at us with real bullets?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.777
Yes.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.863
Everyone's favorite dictator.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.907
Age 19, and before his
romantic novel <i>Mein Kampf,</i>

14:08.973 --> 14:12.873
he was a failed art student at the
Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.753
- Hitler painted that?
- It's not bad.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.916
- Eh, it's not good.
- This photograph

14:17.982 --> 14:20.801
has been obtained by the OSS.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.258
It's a model of his
planned Fuhrer Museum,

14:23.321 --> 14:26.015
to be built in his hometown
of Linz in Austria.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.428
- Fuhrer Museum?
- It'd be one of the biggest in the world.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.346
Gonna take a lot of
art to fill that up.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.604
Exactly right.

14:32.663 --> 14:36.984
We already know he's stealing art from
Amsterdam, Warsaw, and from Paris.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.317
The French are hiding it, the
Germans are finding and taking it.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.027
This is why Hitler
didn't bomb Paris.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.858
He bombed London.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.743
Yes, I know.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.654
Have they started building?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.948
No. That's the point.

14:50.014 --> 14:54.085
They're stealing the art
and hiding it somewhere.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.214
We think they're hiding it in homes
in this area and towards the east.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.338
Our boys are in Normandy
giving them hell,

15:01.401 --> 15:05.426
so that means it's our turn next,
over the Channel and into France.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.053
When?

15:08.116 --> 15:10.264
- Soon.
- We're gonna start with James.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.521
He has a friend in Paris,
director of the National Museum.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.853
- If he's still alive.
- If he's alive, he'll have some idea

15:16.916 --> 15:20.486
where the French art has been hidden.
We need that information.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.444
Lieutenant, you'll cross
the Channel to Deauville.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.325
A contact named Emile
will get you into Paris.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.279
Well, it's a good thing
I'm fluent in French.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.913
Do we get to kill anybody?

15:30.972 --> 15:34.326
I don't know about you guys,
but I'd like to kill somebody.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.917
- You want to shoot Hitler, private?
- I wouldn't mind it.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.166
And Richard, if you call me "private"
again, I will take a shot at you.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.880
Okay, so that's it.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.550
<i>We'll ship out in
the next few days.</i>

15:46.612 --> 15:50.387
<i>Although the war is coming to an
end, it isn't any less dangerous.</i>

15:50.450 --> 15:53.474
<i>So walk carefully,
take no undue chances.</i>

15:53.536 --> 15:57.857
<i>And remember that your lives are
more important than a piece of art.</i>

16:39.540 --> 16:42.564
Sarge, can you tell us where
to find command and control?

16:42.627 --> 16:44.274
- Just got here?
- Yeah.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.032
Top brass command post is about
a quarter-mile that way, past K.P.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.533
Thanks!

16:50.426 --> 16:52.073
What?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.457
- If you'd read the orders...
- I don't give a shit.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.169
The orders say, "Don't knock
out old buildings..."

17:03.231 --> 17:05.208
- To be fair...
- Do not interrupt me!

17:05.983 --> 17:08.676
If you think I'll write
home to some kid's mom

17:08.736 --> 17:13.512
saying her boy's dead because we couldn't
take out a church tower, I will not.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.472
So have at it.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.683
Anything else?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.898
No, sir.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.900
I think that went well.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.910
Looks like we're walking.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.946
Don't stand there.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.736
Come in.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.846
What are you doing here?

18:20.683 --> 18:22.626
Looking for you.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.954
Sit down.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.847
Do you know why I'm here?

18:35.406 --> 18:40.307
- Mm.
- You have a brother. Peter, yes?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.807
Yes, you do.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.192
Are you close?

18:48.878 --> 18:50.696
He's my brother.

18:51.047 --> 18:54.617
Why didn't you tell me he
fought for the Resistance?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.987
He doesn't.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.869
He doesn't now.
He was shot this morning.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.704
He was trying to steal a truck.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.912
A truck filled with
artwork going to Germany.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.455
And he was shot dead.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.262
How do you think he
knew about that truck?

19:22.745 --> 19:24.518
You see, Claire,

19:24.914 --> 19:27.016
because you know the museum,

19:27.583 --> 19:30.687
all the collectors, the art,

19:30.753 --> 19:32.696
you have a value to me.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.492
And yet I have no doubt that if I
were to search this apartment,

19:36.550 --> 19:40.325
I'd find things that would make
our working together impossible.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.491
Shall I?

19:44.266 --> 19:46.368
Do as you wish.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.668
I will.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.964
If I find you interfering,
you won't be fired.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.346
You'll be handed over to the SS.
Is that clear to you?

20:02.952 --> 20:06.898
- I want his body.
- Then swim to the bottom of the Seine.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.131
Granger?

20:34.525 --> 20:36.923
Worried was me for minute.

20:38.028 --> 20:42.634
I thought maybe Vichy were
you or I was wrong spot.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.394
You speak English?

20:45.453 --> 20:46.975
- Yes.
- Speak English.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.389
Okay.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.695
Is there a chance of getting
a ride into Lisieux?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.527
Not a chance, lieutenant.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.442
- Any luck finding some radios?
- No, sir.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.454
You got Lucky Strikes, hash,
a pair of boots, size 11.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.364
- What size are you?
- Nine.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.585
Hey, Sam!

21:17.651 --> 21:20.721
Hey, Sam! Epstein, hey!

21:20.780 --> 21:22.678
- Hey!
- Hey, lieutenant!

21:22.740 --> 21:25.844
Hey, you are a sight for sore eyes.
What are you driving?

21:25.910 --> 21:30.436
- Nazis were in hurry, left a few things.
- I'm glad you didn't get left on the beach.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.896
I got pulled when they
found I spoke German.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.688
- What are you, a translator?
- No, I'm nothing till we get to Germany.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.356
That's too bad.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.404
Who's your CO?

22:02.738 --> 22:04.181
Hey, private?

22:04.573 --> 22:07.927
- I'm looking for Major Feilding.
- Yes, sir. Just over here.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.437
- Major Feilding, sir!
- Stokes.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.475
- Hey, John, how are you?
- I wasn't sure we'd find you.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.268
I had to hitch a ride.
What have you got?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.692
Look at this. I think
this fellow's a Monet.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.778
- That's a Vermeer.
- That's why I asked for you.

22:21.841 --> 22:26.242
We took a convoy of Germans hotfooting it out
of Vernon. A dozen crates filled with these.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.162
- A dozen paintings?
- A dozen crates.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.827
Sometimes 30 paintings inside.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.164
Can I talk to those Germans?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.877
I don't know. Can you?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.968
Ask them where they
got the paintings.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.097
Are there any more
trucks like these?

22:47.283 --> 22:48.430
Ask them again.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.448
- Take care.
- Good luck.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.117
He said they were going
to a town called Siegen.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.285
Five truckloads were
taken from this area.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.499
Five truckloads.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.836
- Did he say that?
- No, he said it.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.845
He is their commander.
They switch uniforms.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.721
Goddamn.

23:28.365 --> 23:33.221
When I see Hitler, I'll be
sure to give him your best...

23:33.787 --> 23:35.230
Captain.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.333
My family were home builders...

23:55.392 --> 23:58.837
my father, his father.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.915
I wanted a simpler life.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.253
Yeah.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.803
It is noble when work in dirt.

24:07.363 --> 24:10.763
You know, James, your
French is not good.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.801
Where did you learn it?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.686
Here and there.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.815
- I studied in Canada for a while.
- Canada?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.692
- Montreal.
- Oh, no, no.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.542
I see you, Stahl!

25:28.277 --> 25:30.220
Where will you hide?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.550
I see you!

26:01.769 --> 26:04.292
Hey, fellas. Look what we found.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.923
- You remember Sam from Newark.
- Hey, sport.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.584
We got ourselves a translator.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.568
I think he wanted my car.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.870
- Where's Campbell?
- Savitz shot him.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.510
<i>So now we know it's not
random, it's systematic.</i>

26:18.577 --> 26:21.100
<i>Every one of those paintings
is a masterpiece.</i>

26:21.497 --> 26:25.067
They're all headed to the
town of Siegen in Germany.

26:27.044 --> 26:30.694
The Nazis are on the run, but
they've taken everything with them,

26:30.756 --> 26:33.700
so we have to get as close
to the front as we can.

26:33.759 --> 26:34.951
Preston,

26:35.010 --> 26:37.488
you and Campbell head
towards Belgium.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.453
Specifically, Ghent.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.165
- What's in Ghent?
- It used to be the <i>Altarpiece.</i>

26:43.227 --> 26:46.297
- They took the <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i> ?
- I'll go with Garfield.

26:46.355 --> 26:50.756
No, Garfield, you and Jean-Claude

26:50.818 --> 26:55.219
get as close to Germany as you
can, to the city of Aachen.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.973
We'll leave in the morning.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.510
Why don't you take Sam
from Newark with you,

26:59.576 --> 27:02.976
and I'll head up to my old
stomping ground, Bruges?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.604
There's a <i>Madonna</i> there I
used to see when I was young.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.691
Looks like we're gonna
be together, buddy.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.444
These are German,
but they might fit.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.159
That one will do just fine.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.244
Watch this.

27:23.517 --> 27:24.914
Any news of Granger?

27:24.977 --> 27:30.504
Well, word is they liberated Paris,
so we should know something soon.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.672
Turn that knob right there.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.762
- Well, I'll be blowed.
- See, I'm not just a pretty face.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.180
How's it going, Edison?

27:44.246 --> 27:46.974
Would you take that radio
over there to the boys?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.859
- Let's see if this damn thing works.
- You bet.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.446
Frank, I wanted to say thanks.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.493
For what?

27:58.844 --> 28:00.321
For another chance.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.245
Donnie, we've all screwed
up on some level.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.376
Yours was just...

28:06.435 --> 28:07.878
Just at a high level.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.922
You're here because you're
the best man for the job.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.754
Not charity?

28:13.984 --> 28:15.552
Well, a little.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.804
Monuments Men Radio
is about to go live.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.469
I hope we play music.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.889
<i>Calling London, calling London
and all the ships at sea.</i>

28:26.955 --> 28:29.023
We read you loud and clear.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.356
<i>- How far will this thing reach?
- We'll find out tomorrow.</i>

28:32.419 --> 28:33.771
<i>Roger that.</i>

28:38.008 --> 28:39.451
Are all the fellas there?

28:40.010 --> 28:41.578
They are.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.572
<i>All right, listen up, fellas.</i>

28:43.639 --> 28:46.583
<i>I think you should know
the truth as I see it.</i>

28:47.476 --> 28:50.750
This mission was never
designed to succeed.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.415
It's, uh...

28:52.773 --> 28:54.633
If they were honest,
they would tell us that.

28:55.984 --> 29:00.009
<i>They'd tell us that with this many
people dying, who cares about art?</i>

29:00.447 --> 29:03.892
They're wrong, because that's
exactly what we're fighting for,

29:03.951 --> 29:08.101
for our culture and
for our way of life.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.272
You can wipe out a
generation of people,

29:12.334 --> 29:16.735
you can burn their homes to the ground,
and somehow they'll still come back.

29:17.506 --> 29:22.157
But if you destroy their
achievements and their history,

29:22.386 --> 29:25.205
then it's like they never existed.

29:25.347 --> 29:28.701
Just ash floating.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.254
<i>That's what Hitler wants.</i>

29:33.397 --> 29:36.592
<i>And it's the one thing
we simply can't allow.</i>

29:41.530 --> 29:43.177
I'll see you in the morning.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.306
Now I'm depressed.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.276
I want to make a toast.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.812
Uh-oh.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.823
Um, I think you fellas are...

30:06.388 --> 30:09.162
And I'm proud to be
a Monuments Man.

30:10.392 --> 30:16.124
When this all broke out, I wanted to
be a flier pilot... A fighter pilot.

30:16.398 --> 30:19.968
But I got bad eyes,
my hearing is not good.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.548
Right here is the only
way I get into this war.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.514
Now, I'm not some
New York socialite,

30:28.577 --> 30:31.601
I haven't won any awards
like all of you, but...

30:32.414 --> 30:34.858
But I'm guessing you feel the same.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.944
This is our time.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.406
My country thanks you,
and I thank you.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.158
Screw the Germans.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.361
Present company expected.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.496
To the Monuments Men.

30:49.139 --> 30:52.209
- To the Monuments.
- To the Monuments Men.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.875
<i>You have children?</i>

30:56.355 --> 30:59.129
Two, yeah. A 12-year-old
and a 9-year-old.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.840
- Boy and girl?
- Two girls.

31:01.902 --> 31:04.380
- Two girls, hmm.
- Heh-heh, I know.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.760
I know.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.550
I have a boy.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.179
A 17-year-old boy. He's, uh...

31:13.121 --> 31:16.191
He's with the Resistance
up in the north.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.646
In the north?

31:18.460 --> 31:21.484
- Yeah.
- Rough up there.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.398
Yeah, it's rough.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.329
Hard times.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.538
Yeah, hard times.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.214
You like to fly?

32:09.511 --> 32:11.284
Paris!

32:12.347 --> 32:13.790
Pareee!

32:32.367 --> 32:33.810
Am I late?

32:34.578 --> 32:36.555
- By about four years.
- Ha-ha-ha.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.974
- How are you, James?
- Hello, René.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.313
How much of the art did you save?

32:41.376 --> 32:43.228
The national collection is safe.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.399
But the private collections,
they are all gone.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.317
All the private collectors?

32:48.383 --> 32:52.579
All the private Jewish collectors,
by decree, are illegitimate.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.865
Goering used this place to shop.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.325
And take them where?

32:57.392 --> 33:00.086
Germany. To their homes.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.497
Well, René,

33:03.190 --> 33:06.339
the U.S. Army would like
to help you get them back.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.090
I'm happy to hear you say that.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.804
Where do we start?

33:13.867 --> 33:15.844
Claire Simone.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.116
Claire Simone?

33:38.391 --> 33:43.497
Hoping was I to speak about art...

33:44.272 --> 33:47.091
the stolen art.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.252
Yeah?

33:53.073 --> 33:58.225
I'd like to forcefully introduce
myself. I am James Granger...

33:58.828 --> 34:03.525
and I'm the curator of
Medieval art at the Met...

34:03.583 --> 34:04.730
New York.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.486
I know who you are.

34:06.545 --> 34:11.242
Then you know I'd like to help.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.867
I know nothing.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.411
And will you stop
speaking in French?

34:15.469 --> 34:17.947
Or whatever language
you are speaking.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.286
Well, if it weren't for us,
you'd be speaking German.

34:24.271 --> 34:28.001
No. If it wasn't for
you, I might be dead.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.793
But I would still
be speaking French.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.924
- Okay.
- So,

34:36.783 --> 34:40.558
- how can I help you steal our stolen art?
- That's not why I'm here.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.350
- I'm here to help you get it back.
- Yes, to fill your museum.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.521
I'm told you were at the Jeu de
Paume during the occupation.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.775
- I was.
- I'm interested in what you saw there.

34:52.966 --> 34:57.537
Goering came more than 20 times,
you know, took whatever he wanted.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.039
Where did they take them?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.746
- Who knows?
- I think you do know.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.955
Ah.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.791
You've been speaking with Rene.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.997
Were you there the whole time?

35:07.689 --> 35:10.588
Of course. I'm a collaborator.
Haven't you heard?

35:10.650 --> 35:13.720
I helped the Germans steal our art.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.596
And that's why you're here?

35:15.989 --> 35:17.762
What do you think?

35:18.199 --> 35:20.347
I think you worked
with the Resistance.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.979
And I think I can convince
them to let you out.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.810
Why?

35:24.873 --> 35:27.226
Do you know where
the art was taken?

35:27.292 --> 35:30.612
Who's asking?
The curator of the Met?

35:37.218 --> 35:40.322
We put all of the panels in a
truck, sent it to Brussels

35:40.388 --> 35:43.742
with two priests. But the Germans
found them and took them.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.626
May I speak to the priests?

35:46.186 --> 35:47.913
They were shot.

35:51.775 --> 35:56.051
If we're gonna find it, we'll have to jump
ahead of the Third Army into Germany.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.886
Number one priority, Preston.
You understand?

35:58.948 --> 36:00.971
The Nazis can't keep it.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.894
<i>We'll find it.</i>

36:03.203 --> 36:04.680
I know you will.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.395
<i>- Keep your head down.</i>
- Will do.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.980
<i>It says the Altarpiece</i>

36:10.043 --> 36:13.488
is one of the most
desired pieces of art.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.648
How'd you read all that?

36:16.049 --> 36:18.868
- It's in English.
- Yeah, I know that.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.655
I just wasn't actually
aware you could read.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.921
Psst!

36:38.154 --> 36:39.506
Easy.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.594
So, Sam, when did
you leave Germany?

36:43.660 --> 36:48.186
1938. Yeah, I was 13.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.067
- Did your family go with you?
- Yeah, my parents.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.274
My grandfather stayed behind.

36:53.336 --> 36:56.565
- What city?
- Karlsruhe.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.530
Yeah, you know, there's
a famous museum there.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.070
Had one of Rembrandt's
self-portraits.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.036
See? You were born to
be a Monuments Man.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.452
- I've never seen that painting.
- No, me neither.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.454
We weren't allowed.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.500
My grandfather would tell me it
was because we were too short.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.386
And then war broke out,

37:18.737 --> 37:21.886
and all of Europe was
too short for Hitler.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.643
Have you heard from
your grandfather?

37:25.702 --> 37:27.850
No, not for four years.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.565
He was taken away.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.110
- Away where?
- Dachau.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.454
Hey, how does that work?

37:56.107 --> 37:57.925
What's going on?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.184
This seems to be a
bit of a problem.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.893
A bit.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.904
Here's a thought.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.192
We put down our guns.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.944
You go your way.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.576
We go our way.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.081
No hard feelings.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.539
He doesn't speak any English.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.048
Not a word.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.550
Okay.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.630
You're just going to sit down?

38:43.696 --> 38:46.845
Yeah, why don't we all
just sit down for a sec?

38:47.158 --> 38:48.635
Okay.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.386
All right.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.685
Shh, shh, shh.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.939
Okay.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.970
I don't smoke.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.475
- Take a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.685
Take a goddamn cigarette.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.735
Mm.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.356
John Wayne.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.193
John Wayne.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.706
Shouldn't we have arrested
him or something?

40:35.099 --> 40:37.042
He's not going anywhere.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.378
What was taken?

40:39.437 --> 40:42.711
The bust of Charlemagne, the
shrine holding the robe of Mary.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.966
Okay. How far east?

40:44.025 --> 40:46.799
I heard one commandant
mention the town of Merkers.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.714
- Merkers?
- Sir, please... we have no quarrel with you.

40:49.781 --> 40:53.431
- And we have none with you.
- Let us have them back, don't keep them.

40:53.493 --> 40:54.640
Father...

40:54.702 --> 40:55.849
Look out!

41:07.298 --> 41:08.741
Okay.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.491
So one of us has to distract him,

41:12.553 --> 41:14.451
the other one takes him out.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.916
Sounds like a good plan.

41:17.642 --> 41:18.994
All right.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.079
Okay, I'll take him out.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.417
I'll take him out.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.423
- You have a family.
- So do you.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.470
Okay, you go distract and
I'll take care of business.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.681
All right.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.726
I've never shot anyone before.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.934
- It's easy.
- Have you?

41:43.001 --> 41:45.195
I'm about to.

41:46.129 --> 41:50.530
Okay, I'll shoot, you go.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.345
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:03.081 --> 43:04.524
Shit.

43:09.921 --> 43:13.446
- Maybe we keep this to ourselves.
- I think that's best.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.959
Good evening. Where's your CO?

43:24.018 --> 43:27.088
Colonel Langton, sir.
I'll take you to him. Follow me.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.624
I'm hoping to speak
to Colonel Langton.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.335
Langton here, lieutenant.

43:32.401 --> 43:35.425
Donald Jeffries. How do you do?
Do you have a moment?

43:35.488 --> 43:37.306
Can I tempt you with a cognac?

43:37.365 --> 43:39.843
You could easily tempt
me, but no, thank you.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.636
Are you bringing us bad news?

43:41.702 --> 43:45.022
Not at all, sir, no. I was
simply hoping to get into town.

43:45.081 --> 43:46.899
- What town, Bruges? Why?
- Bruges.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.562
Colonel, my job is to protect art,
so that when this war is over,

43:50.628 --> 43:52.696
there will still be some, you see.

43:52.755 --> 43:56.280
In a cathedral in Bruges is
Michelangelo's <i>Madonna and Child,</i>

43:56.342 --> 43:59.446
his only sculpture to leave
Italy during his lifetime.

43:59.512 --> 44:03.492
And if it can be helped, I'd like to
see it still standing there tomorrow.

44:03.558 --> 44:06.707
You do have an unusual
job, lieutenant.

44:06.769 --> 44:09.839
There is some good news.
We're not going into Bruges.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.920
We've made a deal with the mayor.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.720
We won't attack the city and
the Germans are leaving.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.972
We'll resume fighting
outside Bruges.

44:18.072 --> 44:21.142
If we catch them.
They're running at a fair clip.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.519
Have you seen this, colonel?

44:24.036 --> 44:26.855
The Germans destroyed Florence
when they pulled out.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.732
They'll do the same to Bruges.

44:28.791 --> 44:32.236
No, lieutenant, they're not.
This isn't Italy.

44:32.295 --> 44:35.365
The war is ending. These
Germans just want to get home.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.777
They've not destroyed any French
villages. They're on the run.

44:38.843 --> 44:42.914
- If you could let me have two guards...
- The Germans don't have the time.

44:42.972 --> 44:46.201
They don't have the explosives,
or even the damn tanks.

44:46.267 --> 44:50.372
No, I will not risk a street-to-street
battle. We will honor our agreement.

44:50.438 --> 44:54.634
When we get to Bruges, you can finish
your job in the cathedral. Understood?

44:55.735 --> 44:57.428
I understand.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.548
Is there anything else?

45:02.408 --> 45:04.385
No, sir. Thank you.

46:53.978 --> 46:56.297
Any of you speak English?

46:58.607 --> 47:01.005
Are you Catholic, lieutenant?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.173
I am tonight.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.094
<i>Dear Father.</i>

47:10.161 --> 47:15.313
<i>Weep you might when you hear of my
many adventures with these fine men.</i>

47:15.374 --> 47:18.978
<i>It would remind you of our
treasure hunts when I was a boy.</i>

47:19.337 --> 47:22.065
<i>But rather than a whistle or a top,</i>

47:22.131 --> 47:25.986
<i>our prizes are
Rembrandts and Rubens.</i>

47:32.183 --> 47:35.503
<i>It feels odd that in a
place with so much death,</i>

47:35.561 --> 47:38.210
<i>I've never felt more alive.</i>

47:38.856 --> 47:41.926
<i>My thoughts soar with the tales</i>

47:41.984 --> 47:45.839
<i>these streets could tell of the
Madonna's long journey to Paris</i>

47:45.905 --> 47:49.384
<i>and her triumphant return
with the fall of Napoleon.</i>

47:50.034 --> 47:53.980
<i>You can see her porcelain hand
gently holding the small boy</i>

47:54.038 --> 47:58.609
<i>as if to guard him from a
fate she knew would come.</i>

48:09.720 --> 48:16.203
<i>I know in a time of war my endeavor
must seem small, and perhaps it is.</i>

48:16.268 --> 48:19.542
<i>But I remain diligent and
resolute in my belief</i>

48:19.605 --> 48:23.835
<i>that great works of art can never
belong to any one individual.</i>

48:23.901 --> 48:25.423
<i>At least not in spirit.</i>

48:29.573 --> 48:33.928
<i>The Madonna is as much
mine as it was Napoleon's.</i>

48:34.078 --> 48:39.435
<i>And her hand gently guards me
from a fate I know will come.</i>

48:54.432 --> 48:57.411
<i>Father, I know I've been
a great disappointment.</i>

48:58.227 --> 49:00.079
<i>In defense of the indefensible,</i>

49:00.146 --> 49:03.796
<i>my crimes were qualities I found
in the bottom of a bottle,</i>

49:03.858 --> 49:06.052
<i>not actions bent on hurting you.</i>

49:28.966 --> 49:30.488
<i>I long for the chance</i>

49:30.551 --> 49:34.406
<i>to be back on that pedestal
you so proudly placed me.</i>

49:35.306 --> 49:39.127
<i>Perhaps here
I can make you proud again.</i>

49:39.185 --> 49:41.959
<i>Here at the foot of our Madonna.</i>

49:42.021 --> 49:45.671
<i>I am humbled and grateful,</i>

49:46.817 --> 49:49.011
<i>and longing for home</i>

49:49.653 --> 49:51.346
<i>and rest.</i>

49:52.990 --> 49:55.343
<i>I'm in great need of rest.</i>

49:56.327 --> 49:58.145
<i>I'll write when I can.</i>

49:58.204 --> 50:02.150
<i>Cheers and Godspeed. Donald.</i>

50:14.178 --> 50:16.872
You'll see to it that
his family gets these?

50:16.931 --> 50:18.533
We will.

50:21.435 --> 50:23.208
Thank you.

50:24.188 --> 50:28.259
Lieutenant, I told him not
to go, but he was hell-bent.

50:30.528 --> 50:34.053
- And they took the Madonna?
- That's right.

50:35.866 --> 50:38.060
Well, I'd better get her back.

50:52.841 --> 50:54.488
<i>What have you got?</i>

50:54.552 --> 50:57.405
Yeah, the vicar gave us
the town of Merkers.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.665
They might've stored
some pieces there.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.575
<i>- Merkers?</i>
- Yeah.

51:01.642 --> 51:06.919
<i>- M-E-R-K-E-R-S. Merkers.</i>
- Got it.

51:06.981 --> 51:10.676
<i>- Any word from Granger?</i>
- Nothing yet.

51:10.734 --> 51:14.054
All hell's breaking loose here.
They won't let us through.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.133
<i>We're to hold up in St. Vith.</i>

51:17.199 --> 51:18.972
We'll meet you there.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.892
Hell of a thing about Donald.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.184
It's a hell of a thing.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.790
- What is all this?
- People's lives.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.421
What people?

51:48.272 --> 51:49.919
Jews.

52:58.801 --> 53:00.027
They're gone.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.953
You get around.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.964
I'm a spy, remember?

53:16.694 --> 53:18.341
They're not coming back.

53:18.696 --> 53:22.141
Well, Claire, my job is to
find art and return it.

53:22.741 --> 53:25.685
And this seems like a
good place to start.

53:48.892 --> 53:51.666

on the side of the road.

55:43.131 --> 55:46.986
He took one in the chest. His leg's

The Russians are keeping the art?

58:41.393 --> 58:43.336
<i>They lost 20 million people, Frank.</i>

58:43.437 --> 58:46.381
They've commissioned
a trophy brigade

58:46.440 --> 58:51.171
to collect and keep all the stolen art.
To make reparations.

58:51.236 --> 58:54.385
"Trophy brigade." You gotta
love a snappy nickname.

58:54.448 --> 58:56.391
<i>Like Monuments Men?</i>

58:58.785 --> 59:01.138
I got a letter from
Donald's father.

Said I should be proud of helping
Donald get his dignity back.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.613
I don't feel very proud.

59:11.465 --> 59:14.944
<i>He asked if I found the Madonna.

59:28.982 --> 59:30.550
Okay.

59:31.651 --> 59:34.004

59:37.991 --> 59:40.594
Put the Germans in the truck.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.601
Give them some bread.

59:48.251 --> 59:50.900
Be careful with those paintings.

59:52.172 --> 59:53.649
Touch only the frames.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.618
The frames we can replace.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.716
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:21.135
- No.
- It's a directive. The Nero Decree.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.645
It is written by Hitler,
signed by Hitler.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:27.603
It says if he dies or if Germany
falls, they're to destroy everything.

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.566
Everything.

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:35.315
Where did they take the art?

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.571
Germany.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.825
You understand I'm
here to help you?

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:43.831
I understand you are, but
you are not in Germany.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.413
- My men are.
- I don't know your men.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.670
You'll have to find
somebody to trust.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.956
Yes, James, you tell me who.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:03.928
What's cooking?

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.562
Lice.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.857
- It's called the Nero Decree.
- What?

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.110
Granger took it off a train full
of art headed for Germany.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:18.367
It says if Hitler dies, they're to destroy
bridges, train tracks, archives, art.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.617
Jesus.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.995
So we think most of the
art went to Siegen?

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.372
We know it went through
Siegen and Merkers.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:27.705
- Lot of art to hide in a couple towns.
- What are you eating?

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.540
- Homemade jerky. Want some?
- No.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.424
Garfield, let's say you and
Jean-Claude make your way to Merkers.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.626
And then we'll go to Siegen.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.090
And we have to hope
no one kills Hitler.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.840
I never thought I'd say that.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.059
We'll meet up in Nuremberg.

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:48.016
Oh. Oh, God.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.080
Ow.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.749
- That looks really painful.
- It is.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.251
Very painful, yeah.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.832
So you're artists, heh?

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.124
No, we're collectors from New York.
Yeah, this guy's an architect.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:16.800
Oh, ha, ha.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.801
I always wanted to see New York.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.258
Greatest city in the world.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.389
- Have you ever seen Munich?
- No.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.266
But we will soon.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.895
What did he say? What's that?

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.397
He said not to make me angry.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.739
- Okay, okay. Let's go.
- Ow!

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.833
I... I have a nephew who
studied art in Paris.

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:54.087
Yeah, he lives a few miles from here.
He may be able to help you.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.622
Is he a soldier?

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:59.510
He was a soldier, heh, heh,
like you. But he's a good boy.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.675
Oh. I'm sure you're all innocent.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.389
Okay, okay, Say: Ah!

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:41.043
So how long were you in Paris?

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.678
You studied in Paris?

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:46.841
Yes, two years.
My wife and I left Paris.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:52.391
Hmm.

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:56.107
- These are beautiful paintings.
- I wish. Just copies.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.769
Cézanne. Renoir.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.647
They're good.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.824
So where did you study art?

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.580
Harvard.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.699
Society for Contemporary Art.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:19.335
They're looking for artifacts. They want
to protect the historic pieces. Huh?

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.795
It's an honorable thing
in a time of war.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:26.005
Well, we think the SS took
the great pieces of art

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.970
out through France
and are hiding it.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:34.646
Yeah, I told them you may be
able to help, Hermann. Huh?

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:37.690
Well, I wasn't SS. I was
a soldier, like you.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:40.443
If I can help you in any way...

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:43.196
Do you know a collector
named Rothschild?

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:46.278
- Rothschild.
- Had one of the greatest art collections

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.068
- in the world.
- He's French?

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.488
- Jewish.
- No. No, I don't know him.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.412
Uh...

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:58.378
Does your wife speak English?

01:04:58.436 --> 01:04:59.628
No, no.

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.164
Good.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:08.384
The back of the Cézanne

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:10.048
says Rothschild.

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.018
It was a gift.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:25.529
And the Renoir too?

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.259
Heil Hitler.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:52.723
Heil Hitler!

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.725
Heil Hitler.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.954
Hey, private.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.369
- Where's Siegen?
- You're in it, lieutenant.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.642
It should be this turn.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.849
Who the hell knows?

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:40.855
It could have been the last one.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.894
If we get to a bell tower,
we've gone too far.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:46.986
What do you think?

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:51.532
I don't think we should go
any further down this road.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.709
Stop, stop, stop. Wait,
wait, stop, stop, stop.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.472
Look at him.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:15.928
He's a beauty.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.933
He's a runner.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:19.894
Hey, my friend.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:27.064
I haven't got a thing for you.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.022
Offer him a cigarette.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.033
You want a cigarette?

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:37.745
I guess he doesn't smoke.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.788
Jean-Claude?

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.448
Aah!

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.995
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:12.166
I'm shot! Where am I hit?

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.425
Jesus Christ.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.845
I'm bleeding like a son of a bitch.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.307
Dumb-ass way to get killed.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.225
Shit, merde!

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.819
Help! Help me!

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:36.193
Please!

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.278
<i>When we first started this mission,</i>

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.613
<i>there was some question</i>

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.779
<i>as to whether we could really
call ourselves soldiers.</i>

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.825
<i>Were we risking as much as these
young men fighting and dying?</i>

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.163
<i>And I suppose it was fair to ask.</i>

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:53.046
Garfield, hold onto this.
My wife gave it to me.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.924
I don't want to get blood on it.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.716
Jean-Claude, you hang
on to it right now.

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:03.433
<i>We are no longer observers to war.</i>

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.885
<i>We're active participants,</i>

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:09.898
<i>subject to the same heartache
as the rest of these soldiers.</i>

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:22.786
<i>When we lost Donald Jeffries, we
earned the right to wear the uniform.</i>

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.414
<i>And now we've lost our second man.</i>

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:32.462
<i>From the beginning, I told you that no
piece of art was worth a man's life.</i>

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:36.125
<i>But these last months
have proved me wrong.</i>

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:41.092
<i>This is our history, and it's
not to be stolen or destroyed.</i>

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.551
It's to be held up and admired,
as are these brave men.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:51.101
And now we owe it to
them to finish the job.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.565
Walter, head stateside,
get some R&R.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.445
We'll meet up with you later.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:01.858
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to finish this.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.571
That'd be fine.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.488
All right, let's take a
look at where we are.

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:07.701
- Stokes?
- Yeah.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:11.789
I got this off an SS officer.
He was stationed in Paris. It's a map.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.625
He had a farmhouse
full of stolen art.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.630
I don't understand. Siegen, Siegen.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:23.592
We were there. There's
nothing there. Merkers.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.431
Merkers.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.805
They're not train routes.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.804
- Are they airfields?
- No.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.347
Bernterode, Salzburg.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:35.892
Sir, that's not Salzburg.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.528
<i>Salz</i> means "salt."
It's a salt mine.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.320
<i>Kalium</i> is "potassium."

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.699
Each town has a symbol next to it.

01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:51.867
Bernterode is a potassium mine.
Merkers, salt mine.

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:53.876
Altaussee, salt mine.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.083
- Siegen...
- Copper.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.712
Ah.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.258
There's a copper mine in Siegen.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.114
<i>Yesterday we found 16,000
pieces of stolen art</i>

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.783
<i>buried in a German copper mine.</i>

01:13:56.849 --> 01:14:00.999
<i>It seems the Nazis took better care
of paintings than they did people.</i>

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:04.462
<i>There was no sign of the Madonna
that cost Donnie his life,</i>

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:08.878
<i>but maybe we'll have better luck in the
next mine, in the town of Merkers.</i>

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.054
<i>Enclosed are your transfer orders.</i>

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.888
<i>We'll need you here, as we've lost
both Jeffries and Jean-Claude.</i>

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.515
<i>Safe travels.</i>

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.750
May I offer you a coffee?

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.957
Well, I'm not sure.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.798
I almost didn't recognize you.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:51.754
My hair?

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:55.016
No, I've just... I've
never seen you smile.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:59.099
Well, James, it's April in Paris.
Haven't you heard?

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:02.978
- They write songs about it.
- Ha, is that so?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.610
Are you shopping for your wife?

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:10.273
- For my wife?
- Every woman loves French perfume.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.565
Even French women?

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.115
Especially French women.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:19.247
Do you write to your
wife every day?

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:20.623
No.

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:23.544
But I do write.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:25.796
Are you a good husband?

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.133
I like to think so.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:33.091
Paris at night finds a
lot of good husbands

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:34.722
out.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.516
Well, it's war.

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:40.344
It's Paris, hm?

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:46.938
Sardines.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.314
Crackers.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.191
And some kind of potted meat.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:57.282
- Are you having a party?
- No.

01:15:57.344 --> 01:15:59.242
No, stocking up.

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:03.083
My orders came through last night.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.746
- Mm.
- I'm heading east.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:10.924
Germany?

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:15.054
Merkers. There's a mine there.
That's where I'll meet the men.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.965
I was just reading about your men.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:19.179
They found art.

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:21.344
A lot of art.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.437
And they returned it.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:28.602
Well, what they could. We still don't
know who a lot of it belongs to.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.274
When do you leave?

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.278
I leave in the morning.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:40.989
Then we should celebrate tonight.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:46.744
This is my address.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:52.257
You bring the potted meat.
I'll bring the wine.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:16:59.799
What's the attire?

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.514
Formal, of course.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:06.101
Formal, of course.
That's what I thought.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.293
You weren't kidding.

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:39.300
Mm. I never kid.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.431
This is the best I have.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.018
Why don't you pour the wine?

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.439
I brought some things.
I brought some cheese,

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.144
some brie cheese and croissants.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:53.186
Very French.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.280
I cooked a hen.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.157
- A hen?
- Yes.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:02.453
It should be ready soon.

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:07.538
Here, put this on.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:13.168
You know, in France,

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.425
if you are given an
invitation to a formal party,

01:18:16.483 --> 01:18:18.506
you dress accordingly.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:23.341
It matches my eyes.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.477
Then you may keep it.

01:18:31.081 --> 01:18:33.149
- Rosenberg. Goering.
- Mmmm.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.061
Lohse. Von Behr.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:38.071
These are the key
figures in the ERR.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.699
The Staff for Special Purposes.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:45.204
They started with the
Jewish collectors in 1940.

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.080
You see Stahl?

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:48.912
The SS farmer.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.542
Farmer.

01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:52.669
Here he is with Goering.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.923
Inspecting art to be stolen
and shipped to Germany.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.380
Most of the pieces they would
photograph, then take.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:07.518
And they would send Hitler albums
filled with the stolen artwork.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:10.896
And the modern masters, you
know, like Picasso, Klee,

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:12.432
- Yes.
- Max Ernst,

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.602
were just burned in the yard.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.108
Hundreds of paintings.

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:21.570
And you believe these
paintings are in the mines?

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:24.739
No.

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.738
No, not these.

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:43.174
This is all I have, James.

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.973
This is my life.

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.260
I understand.

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:54.432
This is every piece of art that
came through the Jeu de Paume.

01:19:54.832 --> 01:20:00.359
Now, I have kept train manifests,
receipts, letters for every single piece.

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:06.319
Who it belonged to, who took
it, where they took it.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:09.910
I kept a colored mark here for
every piece, to match this ledger.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.494
Jesus Christ.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:15.457
I'm giving it to you.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.709
It's your responsibility now.

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.251
I understand.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:28.428
There's a castle in the
Bavarian Alps, Neuschwanstein.

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:31.135
You should find most
of the art there.

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:34.896
Thank you, Claire.

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:38.976
And you tell them Claire Simone
says hello when you get there.

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:41.858
I'll do just that.

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:54.288
I am out of wine, but,
uh, I have cognac.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:58.962
I should go.

01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:03.375
You could stay.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:11.509
It's Paris, you know?

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:43.336
I do love my tie.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.420
Say, fellas.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:26.925
Well, hello!

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.757
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, sir.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.049
- Good to see you.
- How was vacation?

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:34.759
Ha. Where's Stokes?

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.116
She's not here, is she?

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.754
Who?

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.377
The <i>Madonna.</i>

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:10.377
Not here, not in Siegen.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.137
She'll turn up.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.014
I'm not so sure.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:20.513
Donald was so proud of
what we're doing here.

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.517
He was proud to be a part of it.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:30.523
There will never be a
thousand-year Reich.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.816
No Fatherland.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:36.245
No Fuhrer Museum.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:42.751
If Jean-Claude and Donald had
something to do with that, well,

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.332
I guess it's okay.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.717
I just have some
unfinished business.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.377
We'll find her.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:53.716
Yeah.

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.890
He really wanted it all.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.393
He wanted everything.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:14.033
- Private, what does that sign say?
- Uh, "storage."

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:17.737
- See if there are any lanterns in there.
- Yes, sir.

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:38.973
You okay in there?

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.517
Sam?

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.313
<i>Buried some 1200 feet</i>

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:29.816
<i>below the ground in a salt
mine in Merkers, Germany,</i>

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.979
<i>our Gls discovered over
100 tons of gold bullion,</i>

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.318
<i>the entirety of Germany's reserve.</i>

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.575
<i>A crushing blow to Hitler.
Grand news indeed,</i>

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:43.240
<i>and congratulations to generals
Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower.</i>

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:51.205
The Army may not
care much about art,

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.416
but they sure as shit
care about gold.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.303
General Patton, what are you
gonna do with the gold?

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:06.394
- Private, give me a hand.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:11.558
I don't think you've been
properly introduced.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:15.358
Sam, that's your neighbor,
Mr. Rembrandt.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.159
You tell your grandfather
when you see him.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.116
Nice to meet you.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.584
Hey, got us a couple of trucks.

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:31.745
Do I want to know how?

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.729
A lot of files. Looks like
they were burning records.

01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:38.395
It's a bunch of junk. An old pot.

01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:40.485
- Hey, Stokes?
- Yeah?

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:43.571
- Can you come in here for a minute?
- Yeah.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:53.452
- What have you got?
- Stop, stop.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:58.040
Stop. I seem to have
stepped on a land mine

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.584
of some sort.

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:04.842
- Why'd you do something like that?
- It was a slow day.

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:09.601
- I wouldn't move.
- I'd like to at some point.

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:12.433
- Campbell, Garfield, get in here!
- What'll they do?

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.974
- They're architects.
- So they know explosives?

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.813
- It's that or Savitz.
- What?

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.818
Boy, it is burned to heck in here.

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:20.945
Everybody just stay where they are.

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:24.825
Looks like the lieutenant here is
standing on an unexploded mine.

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.322
Why would you do that?

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:28.612
- I asked him the same thing.
- He did.

01:28:31.097 --> 01:28:34.326
Well, you're going to have to...

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:38.964
- step off of it eventually.
- Well, eventually, yes.

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:44.800
And either the mine is so damaged
from the fire that it's a dud...

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:46.133
How likely is that?

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.966
Most likely.

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:53.721
But if it's not, there
will probably be

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.018
a sizable explosion.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:13.282
- How much do you weigh?
- Uh, one-seventy-five.

01:29:19.145 --> 01:29:20.963
Grad school, I was 175.

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.101
Now what?

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:38.857
Well, if we did this right,
you just step off.

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:49.868
Okay, well, what say, uh, you
fellas head to the exit?

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.579
I think we'll just hang
around and keep you company.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:55.411
That's not necessary, Frank.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:58.501
I think it is. Fellas?

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.412
I'm not going anywhere.

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:02.421
I'll be fine right here.

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:06.634
Yeah, what the hell.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:10.638
Okay, James, that's
how it's gonna be.

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:14.301
Well...

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:19.648
on the off-chance that this
thing blows us sky high...

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.476
been an honor serving with you all.

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:25.611
- Same here.
- Agreed.

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:31.659
Okay, so I'll just count
to three and step off.

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.071
- Good.
- Take your time.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:48.756
One...

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.674
- Goddamn it.
- Shit.

01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:59.555
- What happened to two and three?
- I panicked.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:01.189
Told you it was a dud.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:54.238
<i>Picasso.</i>

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:09.374
Is that gold?

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:20.476
It's from teeth.

01:33:59.509 --> 01:34:01.156
That's a Rodin.

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:32.706
Altaussee!

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:36.213
The <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i> is
in the mine at Altaussee.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:37.419
What?

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:39.505
- It's right here.
- What did you find?

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.761
- Sam, give us a hand!
- What is it?

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:48.176
It was stored there a year ago.

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:50.929
- How do you know?
- It says nothing after that.

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.522
It's still there.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:57.526
Want to go get it?

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:01.857
You give that Claire a big kiss.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.487
She'd like that.

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:24.296
Hey, sarge, we're trying
to get to Altaussee.

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:26.089
Keep going that way.

01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:28.053
- Where you fellas headed?
- Home.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:29.889
Germany surrendered. War's over.

01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:31.598
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:34.310
Ain't there supposed to
be a parade or something?

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:36.315
Probably not in Germany.

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:38.067
Yeah, right.

01:36:49.304 --> 01:36:52.203
Jesus Christ, they blew the mine.

01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:55.160
- Any other openings?
- Two others, blown to shit.

01:36:55.226 --> 01:36:58.045
They stored armaments here,
then blew everything up.

01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:00.377
- Who gave the order? War's over.
- Ask him.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.542
Caught a Kraut, Wegner,
hiding in town.

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:05.712
Sam, Savitz, find some locals,
get a diagram of the mine.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:08.347
- Walter and I can look at the entrances.
- Okay.

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:09.614
- Come on.
- Captain,

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:11.968
- can I talk to that Kraut?
- Sure can.

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:21.903
- Burn your smokes?
- Yeah.

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.897
Thanks.

01:37:32.972 --> 01:37:36.246
- I'm told you speak English.
- I do.

01:37:36.642 --> 01:37:39.245
- Would you like a cigarette?
- Don't smoke.

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:42.961
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:45.047
So I assumed.

01:37:45.651 --> 01:37:47.799
Why'd you blow the mine?

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:51.428
What was in the mine?

01:37:52.492 --> 01:37:54.936
Salt, I think.

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:58.891
- You know the war is over.
- Congratulations.

01:38:01.334 --> 01:38:04.108
We believe there are
pieces of art in that mine

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:06.693
that we've been tasked to find.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:08.695
Did you take them out?

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:11.903
What will you offer
me for my answer?

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.406
As you say, the war is over.

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:17.621
I followed orders.
I committed no crime.

01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:22.914
According to the Geneva Conventions,
I will be released and sent home.

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:30.465
I was told that before you were sent
here, you ran one of those camps.

01:38:31.697 --> 01:38:34.676
- Who told you that?
- A little bird.

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:39.852
- You're not Jewish, lieutenant?
- No.

01:38:40.373 --> 01:38:42.521
Then you should thank me.

01:38:50.716 --> 01:38:53.069
You know, I don't smoke either.

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:56.827
My first cigarette.

01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:00.748
But, mm...

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:04.247
I want to remember this moment.

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:09.631
I'm gonna go home soon.

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:13.514
Got a nice apartment in New
York on the Upper West Side.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:16.597
There's a deli down the
street called Sid's.

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:19.350
Every morning,

01:39:19.912 --> 01:39:24.142
I walk there and I get a
cup of coffee and a bagel,

01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:26.276
and I read the newspaper.

01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:31.776
I think about it every day here. It'll be
the first place I go when I get stateside.

01:39:31.841 --> 01:39:36.868
I'm gonna be sitting there, eating one
of Sid Meldman's toasted onion bagels

01:39:36.929 --> 01:39:41.535
and reading a tiny article in
<i>The New York Times</i>, page...

01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:44.295
18...

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:47.791
that says you, Colonel
Wegner, were hanged

01:39:47.857 --> 01:39:50.551
for your crimes you
committed during the war

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.463
and you were buried
in an unmarked grave.

01:39:55.615 --> 01:39:58.013
And then I'll think
about my cigarette...

01:39:59.785 --> 01:40:04.356
and I'll think about you sitting there
with that stupid look on your face.

01:40:09.045 --> 01:40:12.319
Then I'll finish my coffee,

01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:15.485
leave the paper for
Sid to wrap fish in.

01:40:16.636 --> 01:40:18.784
I'll never think of you again.

01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:28.164
Sure you don't want that cigarette?

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:45.894
The Germans didn't blow it!
The local miners did!

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:49.778
They found out the Nazis' plan, sealed
the mine entrances to stop them.

01:40:49.835 --> 01:40:51.983
- We'll dig in.
- How long will that take?

01:40:52.046 --> 01:40:54.649
A day or two if these
miners help us.

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.568
Might wanna move quicker. We got
orders to pull out tonight.

01:40:57.635 --> 01:41:00.579
- What orders?
- Top brass.

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:03.992
This territory goes to the Russians.
They're moving south now.

01:41:04.058 --> 01:41:06.581
- Should be here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:08.417
Maybe sooner.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:12.083
Do you have any explosives?

01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:21.926
Here we go! Everybody down!

01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:29.771
Maybe I should do this.

01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:31.902
What do you know about explosives?

01:41:31.961 --> 01:41:33.438
Nothing.

01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:35.239
Okay.

01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:47.512
We're short one. We're missing one.

01:42:47.578 --> 01:42:51.603
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- We're missing a goddamn panel.

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:10.327
We have to go, fellas,
unless you speak Russian!

01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:12.723
We've covered all this area.

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:13.991
We didn't look here.

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.714
- We did.
- We didn't look here.

01:43:15.773 --> 01:43:18.126
This is us right now. This
is where we have to go.

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:19.669
This is this.

01:43:19.735 --> 01:43:23.180
No, this is where we are now.
And this is where we didn't look.

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:26.183
We were here, we went over here.
Where didn't we go?

01:43:26.242 --> 01:43:29.016
We didn't go here and
we didn't go there.

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:31.272
Yeah, we gotta... This, this.

01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:33.273
- Give me a hand, will you?
- What?

01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:40.490
You are going to miss me
so much when this is over.

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:41.945
I doubt it.

01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:50.579
Okay.

01:43:57.648 --> 01:44:00.171
Right now you wish that
German had shot you.

01:44:01.694 --> 01:44:03.137
I do.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:15.396
- Get out of here now, I'm not kidding.
- I'm going after Stokes.

01:44:15.458 --> 01:44:17.481
Be right behind you, captain!

01:44:21.881 --> 01:44:23.699
Stokes!

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:29.788
Frank, we gotta go!

01:44:45.237 --> 01:44:46.680
Stokes!

01:44:49.575 --> 01:44:51.018
Stokes!

01:45:44.129 --> 01:45:45.981
Let's get out of here.

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:52.533
Hey.

01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:57.080
- Hey, hey, we gotta go.
- Give me a hand.

01:45:57.142 --> 01:46:00.246
- No, no, Frank, we gotta go.
- Give me a hand.

01:46:02.273 --> 01:46:05.001
- Holy shit.
- Come on, give me a hand.

01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:07.298
- Holy shit.
- Stokes!

01:46:07.361 --> 01:46:09.054
Granger!

01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:11.011
Jesus.

01:46:11.073 --> 01:46:13.693
- We gotta get out of here.
- Give us a hand.

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:17.183
- Holy shit!
- He just said that.

01:46:17.329 --> 01:46:18.931
I did.

01:46:27.172 --> 01:46:30.617
<i>You can add this to the long
list of Hitler's failures.</i>

01:46:30.676 --> 01:46:33.825
<i>He tried to take something
that could never be his.</i>

01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:38.915
<i>The story of our lives painted
on canvas or etched in stone.</i>

01:46:39.518 --> 01:46:41.712
<i>With the Russians
bearing down on us,</i>

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:44.248
<i>we left Altaussee with
some 3000 pieces,</i>

01:46:44.315 --> 01:46:50.218
<i>including the Ghent Altarpiece and
the Bruges Madonna and Child.</i>

01:46:50.863 --> 01:46:53.512
<i>We did leave something
for our Russian friends</i>

01:46:53.574 --> 01:46:55.426
<i>to take back to Leningrad.</i>

01:47:07.379 --> 01:47:11.734
We headed northwest. Savitz and Campbell
flew the Altarpiece to Belgium.

01:47:11.967 --> 01:47:18.200
<i>It was displayed in Brussels and then
returned to the chapel in St. Bavo.</i>

01:47:27.191 --> 01:47:30.170
With Second Lieutenant
James Granger,

01:47:30.235 --> 01:47:33.555
several trainloads of French
art found in a castle

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:36.263
<i>in Bavaria were returned to Paris.</i>

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:47.068
Thank you, James.

01:47:55.052 --> 01:47:57.405
<i>Everything from paintings
to sculptures,</i>

01:47:58.097 --> 01:48:00.950
tapestries, even jewelry,
is being returned.

01:48:01.016 --> 01:48:06.794
It is the greatest collection of private
art in the history of the world.

01:48:07.106 --> 01:48:10.005
We also found 5000 church bells,

01:48:10.067 --> 01:48:13.421
300 trolley cars, 3 million books,

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:15.715
<i>and thousands of Torahs.</i>

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:20.018
In all, the numbers are staggering.

01:48:20.077 --> 01:48:23.477
There were over 5 million
pieces recovered.

01:48:36.093 --> 01:48:40.369
There are still, of course, many
great works that have gone missing.

01:48:40.431 --> 01:48:43.034
Raphael's <i>Portrait of a
Young Man,</i> for instance.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:46.329
And with your permission,
I'd like to keep looking for him.

01:48:47.312 --> 01:48:50.916
Well, lieutenant, let me have a
talk with Secretary Stimson here

01:48:50.983 --> 01:48:53.927
- and I'll give you an answer.
- Thank you, sir.

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:57.047
And you lost men on this
mission, lieutenant?

01:48:57.114 --> 01:49:01.094
Yes, sir, two men. A Frenchman
named Jean-Claude Clermont

01:49:11.128 --> 01:49:13.105
<i>And a Brit named Donald Jeffries,</i>

01:49:13.172 --> 01:49:16.367
who lost his life saving the
Bruges Madonna and Child.

01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:19.324
Lieutenant Stokes,
I have one question.

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:22.239
- You said the <i>Madonna.</i>
- Yes, sir, the Bruges Madonna.

01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:25.285
- Michelangelo made it, right?
- Yes, sir.

01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:29.045
- And you lost a man trying to save it.
- Donald Jeffries.

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:32.299
You think it was worth
it, for a piece of art?

01:49:33.275 --> 01:49:37.346
Do you think Jeffries would say it
was worth it, if he could speak?

01:49:38.363 --> 01:49:40.261
If he could speak...

01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:45.513
I think he would.

01:49:46.538 --> 01:49:49.016
All right then, how
about you, lieutenant?

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:52.562
<i>You were in charge, and this
gets to the heart of the matter.</i>

01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:55.072
<i>Do you think 30 years from now,</i>

01:49:55.130 --> 01:50:00.828
<i>anyone's going to remember that
these men died for a piece of art?</i>

01:50:13.398 --> 01:50:14.920
Yeah.

01:50:25.410 --> 01:50:27.933
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.104
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
