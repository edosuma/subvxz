WEBVTT

00:00.910 --> 00:01.980
you're wrong.

00:02.050 --> 00:05.950
Why can't we be two experienced professionals
who disagree over a judgment call?

00:06.020 --> 00:07.850
Why does it have to be that
you're right and I'm wrong?

00:07.939 --> 00:11.360
Well,when there's a right and a
wrong answer,it isn't a judgment call.

00:12.130 --> 00:13.360
Is everything okay,sir?

00:13.460 --> 00:14.850
No,eli.

00:15.030 --> 00:17.650
My position as managing partner
of my own firm is at stake,

00:17.780 --> 00:21.600
and it appears the attorneys I've
chosen to defend me against allegations

00:21.700 --> 00:26.270
I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder can't seem to agree on the time of day.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.150
- It's 11:19.
- Give or take a few minutes.

00:29.290 --> 00:34.110
I take it from the argument I've just spent the
last ten minutes trying not to pay attention to,

00:34.170 --> 00:37.180
you disagree over whether I should
take the stand in my own defense.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.980
- It's notven a close call in this situation.
- it's not so much a disagreement over that

00:39.100 --> 00:41.000
- as over what--what the right thing
to do is here.- It's about the proof--

00:41.100 --> 00:44.120
enough! both of you

00:44.600 --> 00:48.340
make your case in one sentence or less.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.060
Ladies and daughters first.

00:52.230 --> 00:53.610
Go.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.800
The burden of proof is
on posner and klein,okay?

00:55.840 --> 01:00.330
We don't want to risk opening you up to cross-examination
to show that they haven't met their burden.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.510
We do if we don't want to take the greater
risk of appearing that we have no other way

01:03.560 --> 01:08.590
of demonstrating that you have all your faculties,which,by
the way,testifying will do very effectively.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.670
- You used two sentences.-
Yours was a run-on.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.960
I'm going to testify.

01:14.270 --> 01:17.660
I respect your point of view on
this,sweetheart,but I agree with eli.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.600
And just for the record,I
don't think you're wrong.

01:22.510 --> 01:24.770
I just happen to agree with him.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.200
That's the fourth time he's
"happened" to agree with you.

01:27.300 --> 01:31.020
Look,you wanted a bench trial
to protect him from a jury.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.210
You want an expedited hearing
to protect him from the press.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.180
Now you want to keep him off the stand
to protect him from cross-examination.

01:38.590 --> 01:41.830
He needs a litigator,taylor,not
an overprotective daughter.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.970
Oh,what about an overeager prot?

01:44.030 --> 01:46.760
who blames himself for
the mess his mentor's in?

01:46.810 --> 01:48.470
He still has the support of the board.

01:48.550 --> 01:51.530
How long do you think that'll last
the longer this thing drags out?

01:51.640 --> 01:54.690
It's just too bad that no outside firm
will get in the middle of this,huh?

01:54.800 --> 01:56.840
Yeah,it's too bad.

01:57.890 --> 01:59.700
This is me.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.770
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.750
god.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.710
Yes,I'm rather anxious myself.

02:13.770 --> 02:18.380
In moments such as these-- not that I've been
fortunate to have any on quite this scale--

02:18.440 --> 02:20.660
I find it best to focus on the client.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.640
The client?

02:21.740 --> 02:24.600
Yes,the client,eli-- the
individual,or,in this case,

02:24.670 --> 02:28.210
individuals who have retained
our services on their behalf.

02:28.270 --> 02:30.710
Because of the thing with the,uh,case.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.790
I'm not getting an overwhelming
feeling of confidence here.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.570
It's okay,sir.

02:37.310 --> 02:39.260
I'm ready for...trial.

02:39.350 --> 02:41.110
I'm just not sure what that trial is.

02:44.180 --> 02:48.120
eli,you're about to face nine
justices who are going to,at a minimum,

02:48.200 --> 02:52.300
expect you to appreciate the distinction
between them and a state court.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.670
"Them," sir?

02:53.870 --> 02:56.510
Sorry,could you be more personal
with your personal pronouns?

02:56.930 --> 03:01.540
Eli,we're less than an hour from arguing a
case before the highest court in the land.

03:01.610 --> 03:04.950
The phrase "get on the
ball" comes to mind.

03:23.650 --> 03:25.010
matt?

03:25.160 --> 03:28.130
I heard that jordan wants to cut back
associate salaries by nearly half.

03:28.230 --> 03:29.610
Not my business,tommy.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.740
Sure it is.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.210
You're the one sleeping
with the enemy...

03:32.280 --> 03:33.810
or at least his daughter.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.530
So is wethersby gonna bankrupt this
place and us along with it,or not?

03:38.140 --> 03:41.020
No,he's not.all right,he
built this place.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.610
He put that rolex on your wrist
and that designer suit on your back.

03:43.660 --> 03:47.400
You don't have any of that without
him,so show the man some respect.

03:53.910 --> 03:55.220
Taylor.

03:55.460 --> 03:59.120
Just out of curiosity,did I miss any
classic matt dowd zingers just now?

03:59.170 --> 04:01.700
Or did you remain completely
silent the entire time?

04:01.770 --> 04:04.390
Tommy was just venting some
very understandable anxieties.

04:04.420 --> 04:05.580
"Sleeping with the enemy"?

04:05.630 --> 04:06.960
He's your dad,and they
know we're together.

04:06.990 --> 04:10.200
Whatever I said wouldn't have mattered
because I'm not seen as objective,

04:10.270 --> 04:13.300
and you've got the same problem.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.950
Excuse me?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.860
In court.

04:16.950 --> 04:21.779
You're his daughter,taylor,and any argument you make
to a judge is going to lose credibility because of that.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.700
You sound like eli.

04:22.810 --> 04:25.790
And if he and I actually agree,that
should really tell you something.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.820
You know,this isn't
really helpful right now.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.620
You don't need to represent your dad
to prove to him you're a great lawyer.

04:30.810 --> 04:33.350
The psychoanalysis isn't helping either.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.130
Taylor... I'm gonna stay at my place
tonight.I've got a lot of work to do.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.030
Okay.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.100
Well,maybe this is the one that
takes you to the supreme court.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.500
What?

04:45.970 --> 04:48.210
Oh,you've got vision fever.

04:48.890 --> 04:50.920
I must have missed that
day at medical school.

04:51.010 --> 04:53.980
You had a vision last week.You
read a little bit of dad's journal.

04:54.010 --> 04:55.510
It's all cool and exciting.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.550
You got the prophet bug.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.600
Will you stop making up
spiritual ailments,please?

04:58.640 --> 05:00.330
I-I have no time for
new cases right now,nate.

05:00.370 --> 05:02.720
I got my plate full with
posner and klein vs.Wethersby.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.150
Just come with me to
see my new patient,okay?

05:05.260 --> 05:07.630
I'll have you in and out of the
clinic in,like,less than an hour.

05:07.710 --> 05:09.180
- Clinic?
- Yeah,I told you.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.700
I'm volunteering at the
park presidio free clinic.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.080
Since when?

05:12.190 --> 05:13.960
Well,ever since you saved
me from the aneurysm,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.150
I guess I figured I
should give something back.

05:17.190 --> 05:19.860
All right,so this patient I've been
seeing--she's only 6 years old,all right?

05:19.980 --> 05:23.090
She lives with her family in a low-income
housing unit in the tenderloin--you know,

05:23.150 --> 05:25.670
the kind where the paint's been peeling
off the walls for the last 30 years?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.760
In fact,that's why she needs you.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.280
She's got lead poisoning?

05:29.330 --> 05:31.000
Serious health problems.

05:31.070 --> 05:33.610
It's impossible to prove
causation in lead paint cases.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.420
And even if you could,the C.P.S.C.
Made lead paint illegal in 1978,

05:37.680 --> 05:40.430
which means the statute of
limitations has already expired.

05:40.490 --> 05:44.060
- Yeah,but,eli
- but thank you,and keep those great suggestions coming.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.730
I gotta get back to the office.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.680
eli?

05:57.810 --> 06:00.380
"equal justice under law."

06:00.730 --> 06:04.790
The equal protection clause was written
exactly for a case like this one--

06:04.840 --> 06:09.620
for people struggling agnst powerful
interests arrayed against them.

06:09.770 --> 06:14.160
This is the pinnacle of my
career,eli-- of any attorney's career.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.010
But for you,I'd be on the other side,

06:17.200 --> 06:20.680
representing the likes of
the L.P.M.A.I'd be dishonoring

06:20.720 --> 06:24.830
these hallowed halls with a halfhearted
argument defending the constitutional

06:24.950 --> 06:28.820
right of paint manufacturers
to poison innoce children.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.210
This is the lead paint case.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.900
Try not to sound so surprised.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.670
ElI!Eli?

06:40.080 --> 06:41.650
Vision?

06:42.100 --> 06:43.650
No.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.400
Yeah.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.370
Uh,you could tell?

06:46.440 --> 06:47.250
Yeah,you had vision face.

06:47.350 --> 06:50.420
- And now who's making up ailments?
- Okay,so what did you see?

06:50.420 --> 06:52.850
Was it--I mean,was
it about my case?

06:53.010 --> 06:54.830
It was about my
case,wasn't it?-I knew it.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.430
How could you p

06:58.270 --> 07:00.160
you tell me you haven't
been reading dad's journal.

07:00.390 --> 07:03.640
- I haven't been reading dad's journal.
- Well,skimming it,then.

07:03.770 --> 07:04.400
You have!

07:04.510 --> 07:07.670
Look,he said that you
take the lead case.

07:07.690 --> 07:09.690
I mean,he wrote down the clients' names!

07:09.750 --> 07:12.780
When I saw the kims' names
in here,I nearly had a stroke.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.310
Look,I-I-I
dog-eared the page.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.910
- Nate.-
Yeah,o-okay.

07:16.110 --> 07:20.460
- I-I'm sure that you associate the journal with
grace,and that doesn't- this is not about her.

07:20.570 --> 07:25.390
This is about me not wanting to live my life
according to dad's unabomber prophecy manifesto.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.500
If you only knew these people
and what they've been through--

07:27.550 --> 07:29.000
but I don't,nate.I don't know them.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.310
I know jordan,and I know
what he's going through,

07:31.350 --> 07:34.920
and I know what happens to him if I
don't doverything in my power to help him.

07:34.990 --> 07:39.320
So just... go be a doctor.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.650

07:49.140 --> 07:49.960
I didn't read it.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.800
I-I performed a controlled
skimming of just one page,

07:52.890 --> 07:58.080
which confirmed that the case in the book is the same
one that takes me and jordan to the supreme court.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.990
What exactly did the page say?

08:00.070 --> 08:01.630
See foseyourlf.

08:01.780 --> 08:05.080
Okay,now look,kim is the name
of my would-be future clients.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.530
But what's
this--"nurhachi"?

08:07.640 --> 08:10.190
Not
what--who.

08:10.830 --> 08:13.330
He's a teacher I studied with in china.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.300
Well,I'm guessing that
he didn't give you an "A."

08:16.380 --> 08:18.190
What he gave me were nightmares.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.550
He was a student of zhiguai.

08:20.610 --> 08:21.380
Yao-what?

08:21.500 --> 08:22.930
Zhiguai.

08:23.020 --> 08:26.620
It means "accounts of
anomalies." Black magic stuff--

08:26.690 --> 08:28.790
werewolves,transmigration.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.620
Kind of like the buddhist
version of "the x-files."

08:31.840 --> 08:33.400
And what's his name doing in the book?

08:33.490 --> 08:35.720
I-I studied acupuncture under him.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.960
He taught me a technique.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.659
He called it "the dark truth."

08:41.880 --> 08:43.450
"The dark truth"?

08:43.520 --> 08:48.040
It's old medicine-- supposed to
bring mental clarity through pain.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.590
You're making this up.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.240
Well,only insofar as I'm
just educated-guessing.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.090
But it doesn't make a difference,because
I'm not ing this on you.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.020
It's too dangerous.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.510
Well,I already clearly have
the written consent of a parent.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.270
Come on.This is about jordan.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.220
I need to know,frank.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.970
And now for something
completely different.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.760
Take a deep breath.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.700
do it.

09:34.910 --> 09:36.850
someone call security.

09:37.020 --> 09:40.600
Who let this man in here?

09:43.100 --> 09:44.690
I'm just kidding,man.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.920
Good to see ya.

09:46.010 --> 09:48.450
How long has it been--
uh,like six months?

09:48.790 --> 09:50.830
Saw you this morning.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.760
Uh... yeah.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.760
Did the "wethersby" fall off?

10:00.490 --> 10:03.950
Is this little trip down memory
lane part of you coming to grips

10:04.000 --> 10:07.200
with getting your ass spanked on
jordan's hearing six months ago?

10:07.250 --> 10:08.470
Six months?

10:08.540 --> 10:13.030
Okay.I don't suppose you paid extra
for the warranty on your brain surgery.

10:13.050 --> 10:15.980
It sounds like you might
need a little tune-up.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.860
What happened in the hearing?

10:17.940 --> 10:25.170
Oh,about what you'd expect to happen when a lawyer
is crazier thanhe alleged crazy guy he's defending,

10:25.350 --> 10:27.170
as this little reunion shows.

10:27.270 --> 10:30.490
- It was my fault.
- Hey,don't be so hard on yourself.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.710
that's my job.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.100
eli,take it easy.You're back.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.460
What did you see?Eli?

10:43.610 --> 10:45.010
can you repeat that?

10:45.110 --> 10:46.380
I have to withdraw from your case.

10:46.450 --> 10:48.270
- Excuse me?- I know this
comes as a surprise,but--

10:48.340 --> 10:51.570
I seem to recall a rather
impassioned argument about

10:51.630 --> 10:55.510
how this hearing was the most important
moment in my professional life,

10:55.610 --> 10:59.770
and there was no one better suited
to steer me through it than you.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.710
I know,sir,but I think I was wrong.

11:02.770 --> 11:05.860
You should go with taylor,and
just taylor,on this one.

11:06.020 --> 11:09.540
I would just drag you down,believe me.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.040
You're absolutely right,eli.

11:14.110 --> 11:18.990
If you were planning on exhibiting this
kind of capricious judgment on my behalf,

11:19.530 --> 11:23.000
I wouldn't be well-served
by you representing me.

11:23.540 --> 11:27.690
- Taylor...
- do what you need to do.

11:34.750 --> 11:36.620
We're fine.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.790
I'm fine.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.750
I can do this.Don't worry.

11:49.850 --> 11:51.140
S-something I did?

11:51.230 --> 11:52.680
More like something you didn't do.

11:52.730 --> 11:55.930
I can't believe you,of all
people,bailing on jordan.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.400
It's like you chose a side.

11:57.440 --> 12:01.210
I didn't choose anything.I got
one of my 9-1-1 calls from god.

12:01.310 --> 12:05.850
Then you star-69 him and say you'll take
care of it after you take care of jordan.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.360
It doesn't work that way.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.440
Trust me,you want me
off the jordan case.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.260
You really do.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.520
What's this?

12:14.620 --> 12:18.470
Lead paint product liability.It's david
versus goliath stuff--your favorite.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.350
- Just read it.
- Well,I don't have to read it.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.970
There's nothing in this file that could
make me want to abandon our mentor.

12:24.860 --> 12:27.270
firstly,he's not your mentor.

12:27.410 --> 12:29.400
Secondly,I didn't abandon him.

12:29.450 --> 12:32.920
Taylor's handling it,and believe
me,she's happier that I no longer am.

12:32.970 --> 12:36.480
And thirdly,I'm doing this
with or without your help.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.120
And we both know that you're biologically
incapable of turning down a poor,

12:39.200 --> 12:41.570
sick kid case like this one.

12:41.940 --> 12:43.410
I hate you.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.840
That's a lot of discovery for a
simple breach of contract case.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.000
I know.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.600
I'm an artist.

12:49.490 --> 12:51.270
Uh,can you give us a minute,buddy?

12:51.340 --> 12:52.700
Absolutely.

12:52.780 --> 12:53.800
I'm here for keith,actually.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.130
- Him?
- Me?

12:55.230 --> 12:58.740
I need to replace eli on
posner and klein vs.Wethersby.

12:59.010 --> 13:02.210
Well,I'm kind of busy helping matt
draft discovery requests in koehler.

13:02.420 --> 13:06.560
I'm sure matt won't mind,especially considering
how important my father's case is to him.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.880
100%.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.560
Jordan needs a capable and
objective lawyer on his team.

13:20.290 --> 13:22.990
Leesie started having
seizures when she was 3.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.510
We hug her till she stops shaking.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.590
It's the only thing we can do.

13:27.640 --> 13:34.640
And when she started school this year,her teacher
told us she was slower than the other kids.

13:35.260 --> 13:39.050
We're not spiteful people,mr.Stone,and
we've never sued anyone.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.150
But leesie's doctor's bills-- they're more than
I make in a year,and I'm already working two jobs.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.370
Did you ever actually see
leesie ingest paint chips?

13:48.680 --> 13:55.590
No,but when she was a toddler,everything she
could get her little hands on went into her mouth.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.540
I saw her picking at the paint.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.480
If we could afford a better
place,maybe leesie would be okay.

14:01.530 --> 14:04.430
********

14:04.520 --> 14:06.800
******

14:07.110 --> 14:09.680
do you know,uh,when
your apartment was built?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.630
Um,1950s,I think.

14:12.670 --> 14:16.620
No one has ever won a lead
paint liability case before.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.160
That's part of the reason why.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.690
I-I don't understand.

14:19.740 --> 14:22.920
Well,if your apartment was
constructed in the 1950s,

14:23.310 --> 14:26.600
that means it's got at least two
decades worth of lead paint in it.

14:26.670 --> 14:29.970
It's highly unlikely that that
paint is from a single manufacturer.

14:30.010 --> 14:34.650
So even if we stood a chance of
bringing a successful lawsuit,

14:34.760 --> 14:37.240
we wouldn't know which one to sue.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.550
so what do we do?

14:39.610 --> 14:41.660
We sue them all.

14:56.950 --> 15:00.600
if you don't mind,I'd like it to be just
me and leesie at the plaintiff's table.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.390
You're demoting me to the gallery?

15:02.490 --> 15:04.290
- Very mature,eli.
- It's not like that.

15:04.410 --> 15:05.860
It's just,gibbons is gonna
have an army in there.

15:05.910 --> 15:08.500
I want it to be as few people
as possible at our table.

15:08.550 --> 15:11.880
Sympathy is our best and only play here.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.980
Okay.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.490
frankly,I'd always been
in awe of jordan wethersby.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.610
The man was single-minded.

15:29.670 --> 15:33.460
It was rare finding a man
whose tenacity exceeded my own.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.870
You can imagine my surprise when I get
a phone call out of the literal blue,

15:36.950 --> 15:41.650
telling me he could "no longer in
good conscience" represent my company.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.300
Did he explain why?

15:43.350 --> 15:48.360
He registered some moral indignation regarding
the wages we pay at our sri lanka factory.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.910
It was like I didn't
even know the man anymore.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.580
- Objection.
- Sustained.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.040
Nothing further,your honor.

15:58.190 --> 16:02.200
So for over 30 years,jordan
wethersby was an amoral gun for hire,

16:02.270 --> 16:05.030
- and his sudden conscience makes him unrecognizable
- objection.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.280
Withdrawn.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.850
What is the mills foundation?

16:07.960 --> 16:11.330
It's a public interest
nonprofit I started with the,uh,

16:11.440 --> 16:14.310
- proceeds from my company's I.P.O.
- Whose idea was it?

16:14.370 --> 16:16.520
It was your
father's-- jordan'S.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.240
I take it he made that suggestion
during that same phone call last week?

16:19.280 --> 16:24.040
Oh,no,nothat was... that
was nearly 30 years ago.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.690
When mr. Wethersby was suffering
from pre-traumatic stress disorder.

16:28.830 --> 16:30.330
Are we out of witnesses?

16:30.430 --> 16:34.530
Just one more for the plaintiffs,your
honor-- ellen wethersby.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.010
It's a stunt,your honor.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.380
Actually,I withdraw that.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.620
To be a stunt,it'd have to be
in service of a legitimate case.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.050
This is a legitimate case.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.310
Hundreds of people have filed
lead paint liability suits.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.930
Just out of curiosity,how many of those cases
were filed within the statute of limitations?

16:48.950 --> 16:50.500
We'll be able to prove it here.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.740
Through discovery,we will obtain
evidence that will prove lead paint--

16:52.790 --> 16:57.400
in other words,u don't have any evidence,but
you're hoping you'll find some...

16:57.460 --> 16:59.080
maybe.

16:59.120 --> 17:05.829
Your honor,at this time,I'd like to supplement our
motion to dismiss with a motion for rule 11 sanctions.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.230
Your honor,sanctions?

17:08.310 --> 17:11.630
Wholly appropriate when a plaintiff
brings a case as frivolous as this.

17:11.710 --> 17:13.650
Our complaint alleges causation.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.609
That should be sufficient at this stage.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.099
Not for me,mr. Stone.

17:17.150 --> 17:18.460
But I'm not heartless.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.599
Nor do I fail to notice the
6-year-old girl at your table.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.420
You've got 24 hours to convince
me why she's got a case.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.220
I renew my objection,your honor.

17:27.270 --> 17:31.590
Marital communications privilege prevents my
client's wife from revealing private confidences.

17:31.630 --> 17:35.530
And ms.Klein has already been
warned against asking her to do so.

17:36.460 --> 17:39.400
Can you describe your husband's
behavior following his accident?

17:39.470 --> 17:42.330
Objection.Mrs. Wethersby
is not a psychogist.

17:42.370 --> 17:46.870
I am not asking her to diagnose
his behavior-- merely describe it.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.530
Overruled.

17:53.010 --> 17:55.700
he's different,isn't he?

17:55.730 --> 17:58.320
He's different since the bank.

18:05.130 --> 18:07.370
He can't seem to fall asleep.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.820
When he does,he can't stay that way.

18:09.870 --> 18:12.060
He's spending more time at the office.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.910
When he does come home,he just works.

18:16.090 --> 18:18.580
Thank you for your candor.

18:22.870 --> 18:25.510
The lack of sleep,the
constant work--

18:25.580 --> 18:30.680
are you describing someone traumatized
by an accident or reinvigorated by it?

18:30.760 --> 18:32.500
I don't know.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.830
You're in therapy,aren't you?

18:34.900 --> 18:36.630
Objection.Relevance?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.830
Just give me one more question.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.160
Yes,I'm in therapy.

18:42.210 --> 18:45.160
So obviously you
believe in its benefits.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.040
But you didn't suggest that
your husband see someone?

18:48.850 --> 18:50.500
No.

18:50.570 --> 18:53.020
Clearly,you're not that worrd about him.

18:55.850 --> 19:01.160
Have you expressed your concern fr
youhusband to anyone other than him?

19:01.290 --> 19:02.630
Yes.

19:02.670 --> 19:04.970
- I told taylor I was concerned.
- Objection!

19:05.070 --> 19:07.350
Is there a stepdaughter
privilege I'm unaware of?

19:07.390 --> 19:09.000
Overruled.

19:09.090 --> 19:13.730
When you expressed your concern to
ms.Wethersby,what did she say in response?

19:16.210 --> 19:18.170
Taylor said she was worried,too.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.670
She was afraid he'd become
self-destructive since the accident.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.170
I'm sorry.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.210
- Obviously,they
- it's fine,taylor.

19:25.310 --> 19:28.300
There's no law against a daughter
being concerned for her father.

19:28.510 --> 19:31.500
That having been said,your
client is very concerned.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.690
I know,but I'll fix it.

19:33.780 --> 19:36.390
By calling me to the witness stand.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.730
I'm returning to the office
to prepare my testimony.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.770
Late night?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.630
My defense team's a bit understaffed.

20:10.270 --> 20:13.820
I know I left you in the
lurch,but I had a ason.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.270
The lead paint case I'm working on...

20:17.440 --> 20:20.130
it goes to the supreme court.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.230
We take it there.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.970
- We're still working together
-  I'm sure you believe your divine calling,

20:25.010 --> 20:28.600
but it's not particularly
helpful to me at the moment,eli.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.520
It was helpful to you when you were
buried under the credit dauphin bank.

20:34.310 --> 20:36.050
I don't understand.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.240
It'S... how I found you.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.160
I was guided.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.680
"Guided"?

20:43.810 --> 20:47.790
Just like I was guided away from your
case to the one I'm working on now.

20:47.850 --> 20:49.770
If I stay with you,we lose.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.680
Enough,eli.

20:50.760 --> 20:56.000
- If I could just describe to you what I saw
- I said enough about your damn visions!

20:58.650 --> 21:02.280
I'm losing my firm,everything
I've worked for.

21:03.950 --> 21:10.710
I stand accused of not being in my right mind,which
is ironic given you've been my inspiration,

21:10.740 --> 21:13.740
and now I'm beginning
to doubt your sanity.

21:13.790 --> 21:16.130
I never told you to go to
war with posner and klein.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.160
You didn't seem to have a problem
with me doing it last year.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.980
What about trying to
fire half our clients?

21:20.020 --> 21:21.840
We discussed changing the firm!

21:21.870 --> 21:23.250
Not tearing it apart!

21:23.330 --> 21:26.400
Sir,you're thone that wanted to
do this,and now you're blaming me.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.840
I'm not blaming you,eli!

21:30.330 --> 21:35.220
But I am disappointed that you would indulge
your personal fantasies at the moment.

21:35.700 --> 21:39.750
I'm defending myself
against something very real.

21:40.020 --> 21:44.540
I promise... I'm doing this for you.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.030
Yes.Well...

21:48.640 --> 21:50.990
those words have never
been more comforting.

22:13.530 --> 22:19.450
Eli,did you know this marble was
cut from a quarry in alicante,spain?

22:19.990 --> 22:24.110
I can only hope our competition
is equally as daunted by the space.

22:25.990 --> 22:30.590
I don't think that gibbons and
his army of lawyers daunt much.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.130
Gibbons?Eli,

22:32.210 --> 22:36.920
the L.P.M.A. Swapped him out after
the trouncing you gave him at trial.

22:37.470 --> 22:40.680
Their new attorneys are
somewhat more formidable.

22:44.890 --> 22:46.280
How did we do it?

22:46.360 --> 22:48.150
How did we trounce gibbons?

22:48.240 --> 22:50.460
Excuse me?

22:51.020 --> 22:52.480
I'm sorry,sir.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.390
I don't have much time.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.130
Maggie,it's eli.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.270
I-I found out how we win.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.580
***********

23:13.650 --> 23:17.890
Your honor,the plaintiffs would like to
withdraw their product liability claim...

23:17.920 --> 23:20.020
if you think doing that's gonna
immunize you from sanctions--

23:20.040 --> 23:25.500
and amend our complaint to include a
claim under the public nuisance doctrine.

23:25.590 --> 23:26.780
You're even crazier than I thought.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.080
- This is
-  I get to yell at him first,mr. Gibbons.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.230
Factories have been compelled to
install scrubbers on smokestacks.

23:32.310 --> 23:37.820
Why shouldn't paint manufacturers be held accountable
for putting poison on the wall of every home nationwide?

23:37.850 --> 23:40.220
That's the most slanderous
characterization I've ever heard.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.100
Wait,you're gonna love this part.

23:42.210 --> 23:45.550
Public nuisance claims do not
require plaintiffs to prove causation,

23:45.620 --> 23:47.760
and the statute of
limitations doesn't apply.

23:47.810 --> 23:52.010
Your honor,the rhode island supreme court
has soundly rejected this nuisance theory--

23:52.040 --> 23:54.230
do I look like rhode
island to you,mr.Gibbons?

23:54.380 --> 23:56.000
Color me intrigued,mr.Stone.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.100
- Your honor
- the defendant's motion to dismiss is taken under advisement.

23:59.380 --> 24:02.390
Motion for sanctions denied.

24:03.750 --> 24:07.000
I appreciate that,that I've
been acting out of character.

24:07.050 --> 24:09.440
In point of fact,I hope I have.

24:09.510 --> 24:14.240
I'm determined to make changes to
my life,my practice and my firm.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.890
You proposed firing the
firm's most profitable clients.

24:16.930 --> 24:21.300
I proposed culling the firm's most
socially irresponsible clients.

24:21.370 --> 24:24.750
But W.P.K. Has represented
them for upwards of 30 years.

24:24.870 --> 24:31.210
Implicit in your question is the belief that the
only explanation is that I've lost my mind somehow.

24:31.330 --> 24:33.970
So what's the other explanation?

24:34.020 --> 24:39.380
That I've had what alcoholics
term "a moment of clarity,"

24:40.360 --> 24:47.260
a realization that the way I'd heretofore been living
my life has been detrimental to myself and others.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.570
Thank you.

24:54.100 --> 24:58.210
All our time in a courtroom together,never
thought we'd be on opposite sides of the aisle.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.960
Ask your questions,martin.

25:00.070 --> 25:03.080
Let's begin with your sudden
decision to change our firm.

25:03.130 --> 25:04.090
It wasn't sudden.

25:04.220 --> 25:10.530
No,you just walked in fresh from your accident and
announced that you were going to fire half our clients.

25:10.610 --> 25:14.240
The accident was immaterial.This was
the consequence of spending decades

25:14.330 --> 25:17.830
of my life aiding and abetting
a host of immoral acts to--

25:17.860 --> 25:20.300
listen to yourself."Aiding
and abetting." Jordan--

25:20.350 --> 25:21.800
spare me the false concern,martin.

25:21.850 --> 25:27.960
It's as transparent as your emotion,which is nothing more
than a naked attempt to unseat me as head of our firm.

25:29.220 --> 25:33.690
You're aware,aren't you,that--that
paranoia is a symptom of P.T.S.D.

25:33.770 --> 25:37.080
Mm,so this entire hearing is a
delusion of mine.How comforting.

25:39.810 --> 25:44.460
So your accident had no impact whatsoever
on your decision to restructure our firm?

25:44.510 --> 25:47.900
No,I was on my way to do just
that when the accident occurred.

25:47.950 --> 25:53.130
Is it fair to say that you were inspired,in
part,by one of our associates-- eli stone?

25:53.220 --> 25:54.240
Yes,that's true.

25:54.330 --> 25:59.650
And interesting when you consider that
mr.Stone is counsel to the almighty.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.310
This is a transcript from eli
stone's testimony of three weeks ago.

26:03.380 --> 26:06.100
Will you please read
the highlighted portion?

26:06.240 --> 26:08.490
- Objection.
- Overruled.I want to hear this.

26:11.450 --> 26:16.660
"I can pack this courtroom with people whose lives
"I've changed because of the other visions I've had,

26:16.710 --> 26:20.670
sent to me by some higher
power,perhaps divine."

26:20.740 --> 26:24.720
And now before you object,this
goes to the respondent's judgment.

26:24.880 --> 26:29.380
Eli stone believes that he's
following instructions from god.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.610
He's one of your acolytes,which--which
begs the question then--

26:32.870 --> 26:37.080
do you believe that you plan
for the firm is the will of god?

26:37.210 --> 26:38.560
Move for a recess,your honor.

26:38.610 --> 26:41.200
- There's a question before the witness.
- We want a recess,judge.

26:41.420 --> 26:44.740
- Jordan,are you being led by god
-  enough,mr. Posner.

26:44.790 --> 26:46.980
We'll resume tomorrow.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.160
I'm authorized to
settle this for $500,000.

26:55.980 --> 26:58.440
you don't win the lottery
without paying for a ticket.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.070
Astute.

27:00.710 --> 27:04.480
This settlement would be sealed
with no admission of liability

27:04.550 --> 27:06.740
and an ironclad
confidentiality agreement.

27:06.820 --> 27:11.000
And you never file suit against any
of the L.P.M.A. Companies ever again.

27:11.060 --> 27:13.800
You don't even have a harsh
word to say to any of them.

27:15.350 --> 27:17.890
I'll need to talk this
over with my clients.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.920
The offer won't get any better.

27:31.370 --> 27:32.780
It's a bribe.

27:32.890 --> 27:34.680
A $500,000 bribe.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.740
Which chris and joanna
aren't going to take.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.810
We're not?

27:37.910 --> 27:39.810
We could pay off all our debt
and then some with this money.

27:39.840 --> 27:44.570
They're paying to keep you quiet and
to keep us from helping other families.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.300
I'm sorry,mr. Stone.

27:46.450 --> 27:47.580
This is too much for us to turn down.

27:47.780 --> 27:49.010
But you do.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.050
I mean...
you just--

27:51.090 --> 27:54.560
I know that you're not the kind of people
to turn your backs on--on other people.

27:54.770 --> 27:58.840
We'll think about it,but I don't
think we'll be changing our minds.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.420
They're gonna turn it
down,go to trial.Don't worry.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.890
I am worried,because I don't
think they should turn it down.

28:14.140 --> 28:18.390
They're drowning in medical bills,and it'salpractice
for you to tell them to reject the life raft.

28:18.410 --> 28:21.410
From the look on that guy's face,I thought
you'd be popping champagne corks in here.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.800
This shouldn't be happening this way.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.010
This is the best result we
could hope for,and you know it.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.940
Well,what about everyone else?What
about all the other little leesies?

28:28.020 --> 28:29.820
- What about them?
- We don't represent them.

28:29.870 --> 28:32.360
Then what the hell was all this about?

28:33.810 --> 28:36.080
- I need the journal.
- What journal?

28:36.120 --> 28:38.680
Dad wrote all his
prophecies down in a journal.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.830
Your dad could see the future,too?

28:41.690 --> 28:43.050
Can you?

28:43.150 --> 28:45.760
No.Well,just once.

28:46.650 --> 28:48.320
You know what?

28:48.420 --> 28:51.840
The kims hired us to
practice law,not sorcery.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.300
Forget for a second about the
future and live in the now.

28:55.390 --> 28:59.640
You don't need visions or a book or whatever
to tell you what the right thing to do here is.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.360
Just do it.

29:09.930 --> 29:12.670
"War does not determine who is right..."

29:12.710 --> 29:14.450
only who is left.

29:16.460 --> 29:20.700
- Mccullough.
- Bertrand russell,actually.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.430
I-I meant the scotch.

29:22.580 --> 29:24.400
It's very good.

29:25.010 --> 29:27.340
I was saving it for a courtroom victory.

29:27.450 --> 29:30.550
Sadly,this one seems
to be at my expense.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.270
Well,it's not over yet,sir.

29:32.420 --> 29:33.940
It's jordan.

29:34.070 --> 29:38.240
After this is over,I suspect
no one will be calling me "sir.

29:38.380 --> 29:43.490
Maybe,maybe not,but,um,someone
will still be calling you dad.

29:43.690 --> 29:46.260
"You might want to consider
going a little easier on her.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.490
Taylor didn't want you to take
the stand,and she was right.

29:49.550 --> 29:51.490
I owe her an apology.

29:51.630 --> 29:54.420
My undoing was not her doing.

29:54.580 --> 29:57.610
Well,she did do one thing
right,though-- getting eli to jump ship.

29:57.730 --> 29:59.960
You'd have handed them the case
with eli sitting at your table.

30:00.040 --> 30:06.100
Taylor didn't get eli
to...yes,that's what eli said.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.460
I guess we were better off without him.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.060
Know somethin'?

30:15.270 --> 30:19.510
It's hard for me to picture the three
of you at my age,just startin' out.

30:19.550 --> 30:23.160
It was,in every sense,a lifetime ago.

30:25.610 --> 30:30.410
exhibit A."

30:30.720 --> 30:33.900
how many glasses of mccullough did
you have when you all wrote this?"

30:34.250 --> 30:36.620
Not as many as you would have imagined.

30:37.850 --> 30:41.650
Then maybe it is exhibit "A."

30:41.890 --> 30:45.460
- I need help.
- Doin that nurhachi thing on you again.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.140
I don't want you to.I just-- I
want my father's journal back.

30:48.210 --> 30:49.800
No,eli,you really don'T.

30:49.940 --> 30:53.750
Look,I-I ditched jordan's case so that I
could take the one going to the supreme court,

30:53.870 --> 30:55.590
and now both are circling the drain.

30:55.630 --> 30:57.170
The book can't help
with that,eli.Trust me.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.400
This book got me into
thisesS.It can get me out.

30:59.460 --> 31:02.270
The book didn't get you into trouble.It
was you messin' with the plan.

31:02.340 --> 31:03.730
Oh,there's a plan?That's great.

31:03.810 --> 31:05.260
Remind me,which part are we up to now?

31:05.330 --> 31:07.880
The part where you realize you
can't control the uncontrollable.

31:07.930 --> 31:11.460
I can't just sit around and hope that
everything works out for the best.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.470
God helps those who
help themselves,right?

31:15.550 --> 31:17.790
You don't want to know
what's in this book,eli.

31:18.380 --> 31:20.280
I wish i didn't know.

31:20.830 --> 31:22.740
If there was anything that
bad,nate would have told me.

31:22.780 --> 31:25.940
There are things in here
te couldn't understand.

31:26.230 --> 31:28.570
I'm sorry,but wn you took
up the prophelemant again,

31:28.650 --> 31:30.730
you had to know there'd
be some dark times.

31:30.810 --> 31:32.960
Yeah,for me.

31:33.580 --> 31:35.970
I chose to have the
aneurysm back.Jordan didn'T.

31:36.050 --> 31:39.440
Now if there's even a chance that there's
something in that book that could help him,

31:39.470 --> 31:41.970
I'm gonna take that chance.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.590
You want to help
jordan?Just be there for him.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.400
You don't need that book.

31:58.160 --> 32:01.050
My religious beliefs aren't
relevant in this case.

32:01.090 --> 32:02.670
Eli stone n't relevant.

32:02.710 --> 32:06.330
The only thing that is relevant is
whether I'm suffering from P.T.S.D.

32:06.540 --> 32:11.020
And if so,whether such a
condition makes me unfit to chart

32:11.080 --> 32:15.580
the course of a firm I've spent
the past 30 years building.

32:24.950 --> 32:29.990
have I made a decision to radically
alter the way my firm does business?

32:30.120 --> 32:32.320
Is eli stone a factor?

32:32.730 --> 32:38.590
Only insofar as he has reminded me of a
part of myself that I'd lost touch with...

32:39.640 --> 32:42.520
that the three of us
have lost touch with.

32:42.610 --> 32:45.420
Fortunately,I've kept a reminder.

32:45.980 --> 32:47.750
Our mission statement.

32:48.210 --> 32:53.770
"W.P.K. Will be a firm that serves the
public good and honors the public trust."

32:55.410 --> 33:02.170
Ironic n't it,how evocat at is to the proposal
I'm now accusedof being crazy for making.

33:02.970 --> 33:05.110
How did we get here?

33:05.250 --> 33:11.850
How does one go from the boldness of a
youthful dream to accusations of insanity?

33:12.000 --> 33:15.980
It starts out small-- a justifiable
compromise here or there,

33:16.080 --> 33:21.600
till one day you start believing
that life is about compromise.

33:24.310 --> 33:32.320
30 years ago,we each put our signature to this
and promised to use the law to change the world.

33:32.980 --> 33:37.490
Somewhere along the line,the law just
became a way to make a lot of money,

33:37.830 --> 33:41.620
and this napkin became disposable.

33:45.310 --> 33:53.040
I'm trying to honor my
true self,my dumber self.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.430
In a way,it is like
post-traumatic stress

33:56.470 --> 34:04.070
because I don't ever want to go back to the
battle that nearly stole that person from me.

34:14.850 --> 34:16.150
Congratulations.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.870
I heard you won your case.

34:17.949 --> 34:19.699
Settled,actually.

34:19.810 --> 34:23.530
My clients got the proverbial
offer they couldn't refuse.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.770
You won,right?

34:26.889 --> 34:29.460
I heard the judge ruled that
none of your screws are loose.

34:29.550 --> 34:30.770
Yes.

34:30.909 --> 34:34.520
Unfortunately,in taking my case to
trial,I lost the support of the board,

34:34.780 --> 34:38.380
which I suspect was martin
and marci's gambit all along.

34:38.460 --> 34:45.420
- So they...
- they voted me out as managing partner 20 minutes ago.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.580
Uh... I'm sorry,sir.

34:48.719 --> 34:53.570
It could've been worse.I could have lost
the case entirely,been branded a psychotic.

34:53.850 --> 34:56.560
Had my license to practice
called into question.

34:56.980 --> 35:00.600
Given how they went at me
through you,I have no doubt all

35:00.620 --> 35:07.530
that would've transpired had you been my
attorney during this instead of merely my friend.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.800
Your friend?

35:10.900 --> 35:16.470
What better term for someone I care
deeply about and admire even more?

35:16.640 --> 35:19.140
I just thought that after
the other night and..

35:19.180 --> 35:26.840
friends fight,eli,and the other night,I
couldn't indulge in supreme court prophecies.

35:27.780 --> 35:31.470
today,however,I could use
something to look forward to.

35:32.110 --> 35:33.870
Sorry,sir.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.440
It doesn't look like we'll be going
to the supreme court after all.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.430
We all have visions,eli.

35:40.490 --> 35:44.570
I had a vision for what
this firm would become.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.200
Sometimes we have to readjust our plans.

35:48.440 --> 35:52.810
If we're not meant to go to the supreme
court with this case,perhaps another.

35:53.580 --> 35:56.240
This case needs to go
to the supreme court.

35:57.580 --> 36:00.050
But maybe what it doesn't need is us.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.550
what are you gonna do now?

36:06.380 --> 36:12.740
I'd considered golf as an option,but the accident
the other week has left my lower back in spasm.

36:12.820 --> 36:17.320
That leaves me no other option
than to continue practicing law.

36:21.380 --> 36:26.930
I intend to create the kind of practice
I've been expelled for proposing.

36:29.650 --> 36:33.140
Might I entice you to follow
your old boss to a new firm?

36:34.560 --> 36:36.670
No.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.520
But I'll follow my friend.

36:45.580 --> 36:46.870
What's the catch?

36:46.910 --> 36:48.210
no catch.

36:48.260 --> 36:50.380
So you just want to hand over
a brilliantly thought out,

36:50.470 --> 36:52.810
fully developed case file
against the paint industry?

36:52.840 --> 36:55.330
Well,not the whole case.You still
have to find yourself a client.

36:55.380 --> 36:59.880
My point is,this is
big,like big tobacco big.

36:59.930 --> 37:01.320
Why me?

37:01.370 --> 37:03.000
We're not exactly besties.

37:03.030 --> 37:05.690
Which is why no one will suspect
you got the information from me.

37:07.670 --> 37:11.310
This public nuisance theory of yours,it could
make it all the way to the state supreme court.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.000
Federal,even.

37:13.070 --> 37:14.470
Are you about to be indicted?

37:14.550 --> 37:16.790
Sorry,you're not that lucky,jeff.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.360
No,I just...

37:18.440 --> 37:21.520
I realized that this has to
be someone else's crusade.

37:30.190 --> 37:32.220
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.510
Somehow you'll manage,I imagine.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.720
You can stay on as of counsel.

37:39.190 --> 37:42.680
In fact,marci and i have discussed
it.We would very much like you to.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.710
Well,that's a very magnanimous
consolation prize,martin.

37:45.850 --> 37:49.820
I have some rather specific anatomical
suggestions as to what you can do with it.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.630
I trust that when administration
sends me my things,

37:52.680 --> 37:56.720
you'll remember that many of the paintings
here are from my personal collection.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.890
Sorry.Am I interrupting?

37:58.970 --> 38:00.490
we were just leaving.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.930
Stay.You'll want to hear this.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.430
Your testimony about the cocktail
napkin reminded me of something.

38:07.640 --> 38:12.820
One of my very first assignments when I joined
W.P.K. Was to review the firm's real estate holdings.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.550
- So?
- Uh,15 years ago,

38:14.630 --> 38:17.440
when you expanded the firm
to this location,martin,

38:17.500 --> 38:22.880
you were involved in that bitter divorce,and,marci,you
were under investigation for insider trading.

38:22.940 --> 38:26.220
I was exonerated of those false charges.

38:26.350 --> 38:27.950
Yes,happy times.

38:28.060 --> 38:31.230
Because of the clouds hanging
over your respective heads,

38:31.520 --> 38:36.080
the three of you decided to put this
building solely in my father's name.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.370
Now the three of you may
have signed that napkin,

38:38.430 --> 38:42.690
but only my father's name is
on the title to this building.

38:50.840 --> 38:57.220
Well... marci,martin,it appears
you're trespassing on my property.

38:57.650 --> 39:01.780
But I can be gracious,give the attorneys
here time to decide if they want to stay.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.800
A week sounds fair,doesn't it?

39:20.760 --> 39:22.720
Don't worry.I didn't read it.

39:22.850 --> 39:27.660
Although I was tempted to make sure george
lucas didn't make any more "star wars" movies.

39:29.010 --> 39:30.850
What stopped you?

39:31.070 --> 39:37.820
I don't want to live my life according to what
I think some notations in some book might say.

39:39.430 --> 39:43.830
I don't want to try to control
the uncontrollable anymore.

39:54.470 --> 39:56.800
That was... bold.

39:57.250 --> 40:01.850
"Bold" would have been reading
it or asking you what it said.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.870
You're gonna take long strides
on the surface of the earth,eli.

40:06.910 --> 40:11.570
And with every step,you're
gonna change the world.

40:11.730 --> 40:13.740
That was in the book?

40:13.940 --> 40:15.790
Doesn't matter.

40:15.930 --> 40:18.210
That's what I believe.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.890
jeff.

40:50.580 --> 40:52.740
Eli.

40:52.930 --> 40:56.080
Maggie,what are you doing here?

40:56.200 --> 40:57.410
What are you doing here?

40:57.490 --> 41:00.290
oyez,oyez,oyez!

41:00.930 --> 41:02.840
All persons having business
before the honorable,

41:02.900 --> 41:06.920
the supreme court of the united states,are
admonished to draw near and give their attention,

41:07.030 --> 41:08.640
for the court is now sitting.

41:19.170 --> 41:21.980
Mr. Chief justice,and
may it please the court,

41:22.050 --> 41:24.700
my name is maggie dekker of
posner,klein,and associates

41:24.740 --> 41:26.910
