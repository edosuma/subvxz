WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:05.838
Okay, Chandler, Mon,
there's only one banana-nut muffin left.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.423
I ordered mine first.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.466
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.344
Give it to me.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.679
No.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.930
Give it to me.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.933
Okay, you can have it.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.193
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.363
That was there when I got here.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.870
Hey, you guys, you will never guess
who's coming to New York.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.164
Quick, Phoebe,
tell us before he swallows.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.458
Ryan, that guy I went out with
who's in the Navy.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.211
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.839
Yeah, I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.551
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.054
Hey, is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

00:55.221 --> 00:57.389
No. Heh.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.518
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces, like, every couple years...

01:01.686 --> 01:04.480
...and we have the most amazing
three days together.

01:04.647 --> 01:09.193
Only this time, he's coming for two weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yay."

01:10.904 --> 01:13.989
So wait, this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

01:17.577 --> 01:19.078
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.709
Hi.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.711
Oh, no. What happened?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.380
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chicken pox.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.799
Oh, no. You're kidding.

01:31.966 --> 01:35.260
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you're gonna get it.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.054
- Well, I've had it.
- Yeah, I've had it.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.222
- Had it.
- Had it.

01:38.431 --> 01:42.101
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.324
Honey, you made the bed again.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.828
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

02:42.996 --> 02:47.124
Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.835
Okay, I am going to take a shower.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.338
And today I will be singing
Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."

03:03.808 --> 03:05.225
Monica?

03:05.393 --> 03:07.936
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.190
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

03:11.357 --> 03:13.317
...or the fattest man
in the whole damn town?

03:14.235 --> 03:18.405
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."

03:19.240 --> 03:20.991
What are you doing?

03:22.118 --> 03:25.078
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.583
Are you remaking the bed?

03:30.376 --> 03:33.503
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what?
The way you did it, it was just fine.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.131
Then you're redoing it because?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.050
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.303
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.932
Okay. You see...

03:45.433 --> 03:49.228
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

03:49.395 --> 03:51.480
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.608
- Uh-huh. Well, that's not so crazy.
- I'm just easing you in.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.610
Ha. All right.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.321
All right, you see these
little flower blossoms?

03:59.489 --> 04:01.782
They should be facing up, not down...

04:01.950 --> 04:05.452
...because, well, the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.208
You don't love me anymore, do you?

04:13.461 --> 04:16.546
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.757
Really?

04:20.134 --> 04:22.302
Wow. Well, then, come on.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.889
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.229
Joey, if you need something
to hold you over...

04:32.397 --> 04:35.148
...I can get you a job right here
as an entry-level processor.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.317
Don't you need experience
for a job like that?

04:37.485 --> 04:38.902
It's not that hard to learn.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.864
And as for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.535
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.205
Hey, Chandler.
Here's this morning's projections.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.374
Hey, thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.625
- Hey
SCOTT: Hey.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.086
Joey is a, uh, fellow processor.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.879
No kidding?

04:59.215 --> 05:00.465
Oh, yeah.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.595
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.225
- Where do you work?
- Uh, well, right now I'm in between things.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.937
You know how it is. One day
you're processing, the next day...

05:14.105 --> 05:16.940
...you're not so much
processing anymore.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.651
I was telling Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.403
Fleischman's group.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.072
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.037
Are all you processors dorks?

05:35.209 --> 05:38.837
Ugh. This lipstick looks
just great on you.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.548
You look fabulous, honey. You really do.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.216
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

05:46.346 --> 05:49.556
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.310
I'm hideous.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.020
It's gonna be okay.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.897
Ryan's been underwater.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.484
He's just gonna be so glad
that you don't have barnacles on your butt.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.623
Come in.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.000
Hey, baby, I'm back...

06:17.168 --> 06:19.378
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

06:21.923 --> 06:23.006
What's going on?

06:23.174 --> 06:27.594
No, no. You have to stay back.
I have the pox.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.265
Chicken or small?

06:32.850 --> 06:36.269
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.358
- Why aren't you at home in bed?
- My grandmother's never had chicken pox.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.944
Please, please, tell me you have...

06:44.112 --> 06:47.072
...because oh, my God,
I forgot how cute you are.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.158
- I'm sorry, I never had them.
- Oh, oh!

06:51.744 --> 06:55.247
If I had one wish, it'd be to build
a time machine, go back to when I was 7...

06:55.415 --> 06:56.998
...when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...

06:57.166 --> 07:00.252
...I would grab that kid
and rub him all over my face.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.880
Yeah, or, you know, you could
just wish that I didn't have them now.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.674
Can I please see your face?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.718
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.138
Your face could be covered with lox,
I wouldn't care.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.141
And you hate fish. Oh.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.061
So sweet. All right.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.897
Okay, all right. You can see.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.150
This, ahem, is me.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.698
Sorry.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.366
I am scary.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.784
Sorry, the lightning...

07:32.952 --> 07:35.162
Lightning was
an unfortunate coincidence.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.206
You look lovely. Lovely.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.583
I hate this.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.336
I tell you, I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

07:43.504 --> 07:46.923
And almost everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

07:48.843 --> 07:52.429
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

07:54.182 --> 07:56.641
...thinking about this moment.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.436
I am not gonna let a bunch...

07:59.604 --> 08:01.855
...of itchy spots stand between us.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.782
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.707
- Hey.
- Hey. How's the first day going?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.209
Pretty good. It's like you said.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.420
It's mostly just putting numbers
from one column into another column.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.671
Well, there you go.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.298
Hey, and everybody's so nice.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.426
I just had a good talk with that lady
with the red hair, Jeannie.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.596
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast Operations, Jeannie?

08:34.764 --> 08:38.225
Yeah. Turns out our kids
go to the same school.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.355
Yeah. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.024
Weird world.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.653
- Your kids?
- I figure my character has kids.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.116
You know, there isn't a part of that
sentence that I don't need explained.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.287
Well, see, when you're acting,
you need to think about stuff like that.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.873
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

09:03.000 --> 09:06.169
...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.965
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.974
Oh. Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

09:19.809 --> 09:24.854
Yeah, yeah. You know, Joseph and his wife,
Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.815
You know what?

09:27.191 --> 09:28.984
Just did.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.780
Really, wow. That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.001
You know what makes the itching
even worse?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.296
That you don't stop talking about it?

09:50.214 --> 09:53.091
- Fine.
- Let's just play, okay?

09:53.259 --> 09:54.384
Good, okay.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.845
Here we go, double sixes.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.472
Here we go...

10:00.391 --> 10:01.391
Here we go.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.936
Come to Mama.
Just getting ready to roll the dice.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.564
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

10:07.732 --> 10:10.609
No. This is what I do for luck, okay?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.153
You're scratching.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.779
- Give me the dice.
- No.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.282
- Give me the dice.
- No. Here. There.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.950
Look, double sixes.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.787
We can't scratch. You know we can't.
We'll scar.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.250
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.545
I just wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.297
- No. No.
- Give it.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.757
Come on.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.843
You know you want it.
You know you want it too. Come on.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.220
Let's just be bad. It'll feel so good.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.056
Oh, come on. Come on.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.183
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, God, help me.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.644
- Uh-huh. Good, huh?
- Yeah.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.063
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, good. Now do me.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.066
Do my back. Oh, come on. Harder.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.275
There you go.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.526
- Don't move.
- Why?

10:53.694 --> 10:55.028
- Don't move.
- What are you?

10:58.991 --> 11:02.327
Aah! Stop that. Stop that right now.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.621
You know, I might've expected this
of you, Phoebe.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.706
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.672
You and Milton
have to join us on the boat.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.716
Karen will pack a lunch, you bring the kids.
We'll make a day of it.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.719
Oh, that sounds lovely.
We're gonna have to set that up.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.639
Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.557
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.768
- Bye-bye, Jeannie. Ha, ha.
Bye-bye, Joseph.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.145
What a phony.

11:31.941 --> 11:35.443
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson
when she steps off the dock onto nothing.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.738
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.
- Sir.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.532
Uh, listen, Bing, I got your memo.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.410
So we're not gonna see
the report until next Friday?

11:43.577 --> 11:46.246
Well, the people in my group
want to spend the holiday with family.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.249
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.668
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

11:56.590 --> 11:59.759
It's about cutting my people
a little slack, you know, for morale.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.762
If you wanna see some rough numbers,
I can get them to you by Wednesday.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.265
Rough numbers?

12:06.100 --> 12:10.228
This company was not built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

12:10.771 --> 12:13.690
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.067
If you say so, sir.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.820
Joseph's good, isn't he?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.532
Well, I'm going to kill you.

12:23.659 --> 12:28.204
Hey, hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.541
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.085
Why?

12:35.921 --> 12:39.466
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.760
Okay? If you try to pull something...

12:42.136 --> 12:43.845
...he'll call you on it.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.389
"What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.062
Ooh. Duct tape.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.523
Was I supposed to bring something too?

12:57.026 --> 13:00.862
This is for the scratchy twins out there.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.490
You're strict.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.700
Yeah, well, it's for their own good.

13:05.868 --> 13:10.622
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.959
See, in a tape emergency, you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.421
Exactly. Oh.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.884
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.594
- Tell me the truth.
- Hmm.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.931
Don't you like it better that everything
on your desk is perpendicular?

13:28.098 --> 13:31.309
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.561
- Very good.
- Thank you.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.231
You know what?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.025
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

13:39.360 --> 13:40.735
I'm gonna set them to my time.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.572
Well, I'm confused.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.866
I thought we shared time.

13:47.743 --> 13:52.038
No, no. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.206
You wanna know why?

13:53.374 --> 13:57.836
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

13:58.003 --> 14:00.797
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, come on, come on, tell me.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.715
- No, you don't understand.
- No, come on.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.009
No, you don't have any of these
cute obsessive things.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.095
No, that's not true. That is not true.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.429
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.098
All right, well, tell me one of yours.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.850
Okay.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.396
Ah.

14:16.564 --> 14:21.025
One of my things is,
I always separate my sweat socks...

14:21.193 --> 14:23.903
...from my dress socks.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.157
- Yeah.
- What if they get mixed up?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.660
Boy, I would just, uh...

14:31.203 --> 14:32.495
I would freak out.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.374
You would not.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.961
I can't believe this. I hate this.
You're too normal.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.338
I can't believe my boyfriend
doesn't have a thing.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.049
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.469
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well there.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.227
Hey.

14:57.730 --> 15:02.525
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
- Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

15:03.235 --> 15:06.779
Because he has a strong suspicion that
you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.241
Why? Why does he suspect that?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.786
Because at first,
he thought it was Joseph...

15:13.954 --> 15:17.415
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.879
- Anyway, I just thought you should know.
- All right. That's it.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.547
Look, Joey...

15:24.715 --> 15:27.508
...I'm sorry, I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

15:27.676 --> 15:30.011
...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.971
But unfortunately that's not possible.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.806
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.936
What are you talking about?
Everybody loves Joseph.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.146
I don't. I hate Joseph.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.650
Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.110
Oh, yeah?

15:46.278 --> 15:48.029
Well, you can't fire Joseph.
You know why?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.405
He's not in your department.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.331
All right, okay.
All right, so I can't fire Joseph...

15:58.499 --> 16:00.124
...but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.672
- Not Karen.
- Yeah, Karen.

16:05.839 --> 16:10.009
I'm thinking about having an affair
with her. Oh, you know what?

16:10.177 --> 16:11.970
I just did.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.474
What the hell are you doing to me, man?

16:16.642 --> 16:17.976
Oh, it's not me.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.477
It's my character.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.980
Chandie.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.359
Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives for sport...

16:26.527 --> 16:28.444
...and then laughs about it the next day.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.115
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.701
- Really?
- No, freak show, she's fictional!

16:34.868 --> 16:37.912
Come on! Hey. Take it easy.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.250
If it means that much to you,
I'll, uh... I'll go find something else.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.585
Thank you.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.924
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.052
I liked him. His wife.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.804
She was hot.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.598
Ow.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.020
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.521
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.483
Well, that wasn't easy.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.070
Okay, dinner's on.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.949
And there's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

17:15.117 --> 17:19.203
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.665
All right, you kids. Bye, now.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.751
- Bye.
- Oh, look, look.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.794
A low-budget puppet show.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.965
It's such a shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.300
All right.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.931
- Wine?
- Please.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.902
- Oh. Spilled some.
- I got it.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.499
I must tell you,
you look beautiful tonight.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.667
What?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.545
Sorry.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.216
You look beautiful.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.675
Oh.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.735
You know what? That's it. That's it.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.910
Oh! Oh!

18:41.078 --> 18:43.788
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.373
Good.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.004
You guys, did you...?

19:01.890 --> 19:04.142
Monica, wake up.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.602
- Monica.
- What's up?

19:06.770 --> 19:08.146
I thought of a thing.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.819
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:14.987 --> 19:19.866
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.495
No, honey. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

19:24.663 --> 19:27.456
...because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.044
Or so I would have you believe.

19:33.505 --> 19:39.218
No. Big deal. So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.638
Hey, come on.
You haven't heard my reason yet.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.600
- All right, go on.
- Okay.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.311
I have to sleep on the west side...

19:48.478 --> 19:51.522
...because I grew up in California...

19:51.690 --> 19:53.524
...and otherwise...

19:53.692 --> 19:56.986
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.786
- Oh, my God. You're a freak.
- Yeah.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.164
How about that?

20:12.211 --> 20:15.254
- So, Ryan, where are you shipping off to?
- I really can't say.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.673
So do you have any
nuclear weapons on board?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.592
I can't say.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.553
Well, do you get to look through
one of those periscope thingies?

20:22.721 --> 20:24.722
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.850
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.478
I better get out of here.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.854
Okay, I'll walk you out.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.565
- Bye, Ryan.
- Pleasure. Take care.

20:39.696 --> 20:44.492
So do you, uh, think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

20:45.452 --> 20:47.245
You like that, do you?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.372
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll make some calls.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.831
Okay.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.127
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

20:55.295 --> 20:57.171
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

20:57.339 --> 21:02.009
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and, you know, a coffee at Central Perk.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.719
Oh, I just got that.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.647
Taxi.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.529
Bye, you.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.460
I'm sorry, we're clo...

21:39.965 --> 21:41.173
Hey, sailor.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.967
Is this what you had in mind?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.428
Ha, ha. I'll say.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.853
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.063
Well, then, uh...

21:57.566 --> 21:59.525
...we better make this night count.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.780
Oh, wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.333
Anchors aweigh.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.087
Oh, wait. My purse, my purse, my purse.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.429
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.806
All right,
why don't I just meet you upstairs?

22:35.812 --> 22:37.188
Honey.
