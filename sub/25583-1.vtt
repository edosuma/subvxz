02:10.589 --> 02:12.125
<i>You're gonna break
the door!</i>

02:12.257 --> 02:14.294
<i>Dad's gonna kill you.</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:17.214
I'm gonna punch you
in the face so hard,

02:17.346 --> 02:19.258
you'll fly out the window,

02:19.389 --> 02:21.176
back to where the dogs are.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.140
You can't do it, Pio.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.259
Pio, stop it.
Give Grandpa his breakfast.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.554
Hurry up, it's late.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.968
Push it harder!

03:41.096 --> 03:43.554
I'm starving.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.349
Pio...

03:47.477 --> 03:48.934
Pio, help!

03:49.062 --> 03:50.974
Take this, Cocchi.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.737
This motorino is broken.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.031
It just needs gas.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.501
Pio, stop it already.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.954
Look at me.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.334
Stop it.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.132
And you?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.587
Throw this motorino out!

04:24.973 --> 04:28.057
Go outside, move it!

04:28.185 --> 04:30.017
Don't bother us.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.813
I'm gonna piss
in your mouth!

06:05.240 --> 06:07.448
Nanà, have you seen
my brother?

06:07.576 --> 06:09.192
No.

06:33.351 --> 06:36.185
I can't hear you!

06:42.027 --> 06:43.893
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.110
You sure?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.355
How's it going with her?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.697
Fine.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.487
I'm almost there.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.576
- Want help?
- No.

06:52.704 --> 06:53.490
What help?

06:53.622 --> 06:57.286
He says he's gonna
take her home.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.169
But she has a little one...

07:03.131 --> 07:04.747
Think you can do it?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.465
Yeah, don't worry.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.585
And when you have
a heart attack...

07:08.720 --> 07:10.211
who's gonna take you
to the hospital?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.513
Blondie over here?

07:31.534 --> 07:33.617
Let's see
if you can do it.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.606
Kiss her.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.285
Don't worry about him.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.242
Ke, don't use all of it.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.659
Ke.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.499
Ke.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.974
You don't know
how to burn copper.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.900
What?
For the love of...

09:30.028 --> 09:32.441
Everything's wet!
What the hell, Pio?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.858
Is it my fault?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.856
You're gonna ruin it all.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.905
Yeah?
You do it. C'mon.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.903
I just got back
from school.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.280
You do it.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.576
I am not going to school.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.950
Yeah,
and you can't even read.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.248
Who needs to read?
Look here.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.006
Oh Lele, come here.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.251
My sister is all made up,

09:55.386 --> 09:57.503
and she wants to kiss you.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.633
He really did it, Pio?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.555
What do I know?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.803
Wanna see?
Wanna see?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.097
Stop that.
Wanna see?

10:17.742 --> 10:18.528
Enough.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.776
Enough!

10:21.996 --> 10:24.409
You black piece of shit,
cut it out.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.907
When we get home,

10:26.042 --> 10:27.749
we'll settle this.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.502
<i>Hey guys!</i>

10:33.258 --> 10:35.420
The fuck do you want?
Go away.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.260
You're still here?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.096
Go!

10:44.978 --> 10:46.685
<i>Police!</i>

10:48.231 --> 10:49.938
<i>Police!</i>

10:54.028 --> 10:57.362
Police. Police.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.523
Leave him alone.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.892
Why were you outside?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.941
- You're under house arrest.
- He was getting some air!

11:38.072 --> 11:39.358
Be quiet, ma'am.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.072
I'm his mother.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.112
Handcuffs.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.235
Always with the handcuffs.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.074
Why are the cops here?

11:50.752 --> 11:51.913
The electricity?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.536
No, they saw him outside.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.789
Damn them.
Death to the cops by fire.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.135
- You switched the electricity?
- Yeah.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.798
Good.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.513
Come help me out.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.223
You go ahead.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.689
If you see the cops,
flash the lights.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.604
Okay?
- Okay.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.568
When you take a car,

13:41.696 --> 13:43.153
unlock the wheel.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.237
You stick the screwdriver
in the ignition.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.535
And something else...

13:49.662 --> 13:51.654
This is the central line
of the car.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.538
You pull this up...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.662
and you can detach the jack.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.978
Like this.
See?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.936
Under the wheel,
there are two wires.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.980
One red, one black.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.602
Twist them together...

14:23.738 --> 14:25.525
and it will start.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.818
Then bring the car here.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.285
Fifty euros?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.216
I'm not getting in there!

14:49.806 --> 14:52.594
Don't worry.
I'll bring the car.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.433
Gimme the number.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.699
Alright.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.616
I'll take care of it.
I promise.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.538
Pio!

15:23.506 --> 15:25.873
Come on, let's go.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.881
It's nothing, move it.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.674
Let's go.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.516
And don't wash your hands.
I need that number.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.894
I'm with four ladies.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.356
Let's drink!

15:46.487 --> 15:48.149
We will.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.943
Drink this!

15:51.159 --> 15:53.025
C'mon, let's go!

15:53.161 --> 15:54.993
I'm starving!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.534
Is it ready?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.751
Give some to Cocchi.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.542
We're eating like Italians.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.131
Grandpa, we're eating
like Italians.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.296
Gimme some,
let's go!

16:10.428 --> 16:12.795
Seriously, I can't come.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.262
'Cause I have to sign.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.095
Who was that, Licca?
Your woman?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.140
- What did she want?
- Why don't you run to her?

16:20.271 --> 16:22.638
'Cause I have to sign
for the cops.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.057
I can't leave.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.186
- And you can't tell her?
- I got things to do.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.939
Easy.
Take it easy.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.366
Drink a glass of wine...

16:35.495 --> 16:37.282
and everything will be fine.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.200
Cheers to that!

16:44.253 --> 16:45.539
Pio!

16:45.671 --> 16:47.458
You see?
He's drinking.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.212
Look at him.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.840
He's drinking just like you.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.805
Cheers, Mom!

16:57.934 --> 16:59.470
Oh my God...

16:59.602 --> 17:01.889
by St. Cosimo
and St. Damiano.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.853
Put down the glass.
You see this?

17:03.981 --> 17:07.098
I'll do worse than the Africans.
I'll smash your face.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.063
You're the drunk!

17:10.445 --> 17:12.186
What are you doing?

17:16.117 --> 17:18.952
Put it down.
You're gonna get wasted.

17:23.376 --> 17:28.416
They say they don't drink,
but everyone's drunk.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.164
Pour that out.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.504
Slap her in the face!

17:34.929 --> 17:36.921
She wants to
drink like this?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.843
I'll break your head.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.142
You don't believe me?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.312
Gimme a little more.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.022
Chill out.
It's only a little.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.613
Cheers.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.316
Look at you!

17:58.452 --> 18:00.569
Why's that bottle
in your hand?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.036
I've got to lead
the way tonight...

18:06.168 --> 18:07.955
or else everyone's fucked.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.760
You're all crazy.
Drunk like Africans.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.430
Just like the Africans.

18:28.232 --> 18:32.192
They get drunk
and smash each other up.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.354
You're gonna end up
like the Africans.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.071
They get drunk.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.237
Last winter,
we saw one.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.359
I took my daughter...

18:41.495 --> 18:43.578
she cut her hand
in the door

18:43.706 --> 18:45.117
and I took her
to the hospital.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.492
You should've see it!
It was December, or January...

18:48.628 --> 18:52.622
he had his shirt off.
It was so cold, freezing.

18:52.757 --> 18:53.918
He was naked.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.962
He punched the wall.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.800
He punched the door.

18:57.928 --> 19:01.512
He was covered in blood.
It was everywhere.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.803
I was so scared of him.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.347
- He kept hitting stuff.
- The Carabinieri were there.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.230
- The Carabinieri!
- They saw all of it.

19:11.817 --> 19:16.107
Even they were scared,
with their billy clubs.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.731
One time I saw one

19:18.866 --> 19:21.358
outside the supermarket.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.282
He's like, "Come here."
I said, "What do you want?"

19:24.413 --> 19:25.699
I said,
"Jesus, you're ugly."

19:25.831 --> 19:27.743
"Ugly African, go away!"

19:27.875 --> 19:29.787
"No, come here!"

19:29.919 --> 19:32.206
He grabbed my hand
and I freaked,

19:32.338 --> 19:34.751
"Ugly African,
get out of here."

19:34.882 --> 19:37.625
I'm scared of them.
Seriously.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.922
I didn't get any of that.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.388
He said
he would get drunk...

19:48.521 --> 19:50.228
and people would try
to steal his animals.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.396
I would drink...

19:53.025 --> 19:55.108
No one could fuck with dad.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.772
Don't smoke too much, Pio.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.691
I care what you say?

20:01.909 --> 20:02.990
Pio...

20:03.119 --> 20:05.327
- Did you switch the power?
- No.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.116
What do you mean, no?

20:07.248 --> 20:09.581
How are we supposed
to pay the bills?

20:09.709 --> 20:10.790
Who's gonna give us money?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.659
I don't know!

20:12.795 --> 20:14.752
- You don't know?
- What do I know?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.213
Instead of following
your brother around,

20:17.341 --> 20:20.584
do what you are told.

20:21.971 --> 20:22.927
Understand?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.172
Go switch the power back.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.013
Mom...

21:08.142 --> 21:09.678
Mom!

21:11.771 --> 21:13.387
- Where?
- Outside.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.901
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.819
A word.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.705
Where are you going?

21:39.840 --> 21:40.830
C'mon, let me by.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.673
Get inside,
you can't come.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.795
- Don't break my balls.
- You can't come with me!

21:45.930 --> 21:47.296
C'mon.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.260
- Are you gonna come to the garage?
- No, no.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.759
- Huh?
- No, no...

21:52.895 --> 21:54.978
- If I let you go, are you gonna come?
- No.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.017
- Huh?
- No, c'mon.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.311
- Huh?
- I won't come.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.605
- You sure?
- Sure.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.062
Disappear inside.
Hurry.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.110
You can't come with me.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.658
Cut it out!

22:08.786 --> 22:10.243
Shut the door.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.696
Is that okay?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.994
Go to sleep,
don't bother us.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.909
And don't yell.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.588
<i>We've told you,
don't touch the cars in Gioia.</i>

23:07.720 --> 23:09.336
<i>We didn't.</i>

23:09.471 --> 23:11.007
<i>We go to Reggio for that.</i>

23:11.140 --> 23:14.178
<i>- Haven't heard of a black Punto with a rabbit sticker?
- No, no, no.</i>

23:14.310 --> 23:16.848
<i>If I had it,
I'd tell you.</i>

23:16.979 --> 23:18.595
I heard about it all day.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.938
A black Punto disappeared.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.900
Yes, I steal.
But not that car.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.519
- And you don't know anything?
- No.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.397
I go to Reggio for that.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.741
<i>Let's pretend
nothing happened.</i>

23:31.869 --> 23:35.613
<i>We've heard that before.</i>

23:35.915 --> 23:37.326
We have a job for you.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.950
Down at the Tonnara.
A house.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.744
<i>They're away tonight.</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:44.246
<i>I'll go. I'm free.</i>

23:44.381 --> 23:46.043
<i>By yourself?</i>

24:25.923 --> 24:27.414
Thank you.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.181
<i>I got that room.</i>

26:08.317 --> 26:11.481
<i>Hurry up,
I don't want to go to jail.</i>

26:15.783 --> 26:18.116
Ho, ho.
Where are you going?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.700
Come here!

26:46.063 --> 26:47.975
Fucking gypsy.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.570
Hello, police?

26:55.697 --> 26:57.939
Please send a car
to Scina 015.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.031
Hurry...

27:06.625 --> 27:08.287
There's a gang of gypsies
making a mess.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.954
They're stealing everything.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.086
Scina 015.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.206
Please come immediately...

27:14.341 --> 27:16.333
I don't know what to do.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.715
Please send a squad.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.551
Where are you going?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.165
<i>Police!</i>

30:03.218 --> 30:05.756
<i>- Police!
- Police!</i>

30:06.221 --> 30:08.087
<i>Police!</i>

30:14.646 --> 30:16.182
Let him go!

30:47.929 --> 30:49.170
What is this?

30:49.306 --> 30:50.467
Two wires.

30:50.599 --> 30:51.464
- Two wires?
- Yes.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.966
Arrest him.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.055
For what?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.679
You guys never look
anywhere else.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.187
Always here.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.807
Let him go.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.559
Let him go!

31:05.572 --> 31:06.938
What did he do?

31:07.074 --> 31:10.283
You go round and round,
but always end up here.

31:12.245 --> 31:15.158
You caught Toto Riina, see?
You have him.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.872
Ma. Ma...
the "Italians."

32:06.383 --> 32:07.874
Get inside.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.421
Go inside.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.894
Getting warm, Mrs. Lolanda?

32:28.029 --> 32:28.985
It's cold.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.355
Good evening.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.536
Thank you.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.203
<i>I heard your boy
was arrested.</i>

32:41.334 --> 32:43.246
<i>What can I do?</i>

32:43.378 --> 32:45.620
<i>These things happen.</i>

32:45.755 --> 32:47.747
<i>You know what they say...</i>

32:47.883 --> 32:51.001
<i>"It's better to drag chains
than to drag friends down."</i>

32:51.136 --> 32:53.002
<i>He'll be out.</i>

32:54.973 --> 32:56.680
<i>He'll be out soon,
for sure.</i>

32:57.934 --> 33:01.223
<i>I spoke to the owner
of the white Fiat.</i>

33:01.730 --> 33:04.848
<i>He wants it back at
Piazza dell'lncontro tonight.</i>

33:06.151 --> 33:08.393
<i>We said 300 euros.</i>

33:09.362 --> 33:11.319
<i>- Can you handle that?
- Don't worry.</i>

33:12.824 --> 33:16.192
<i>Send someone later.
Make sure it's taken care of.</i>

33:17.496 --> 33:19.328
<i>Good evening.</i>

33:20.832 --> 33:22.824
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:36.181 --> 33:37.672
<i>Pio...</i>

33:39.476 --> 33:42.264
<i>I know you're back there.
Come here.</i>

33:43.480 --> 33:45.096
<i>Pio.</i>

33:49.569 --> 33:52.607
- Tell Nanà to take the car.
- No, I'll go.

33:52.739 --> 33:53.900
You can't go.

33:54.032 --> 33:54.738
Why not?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.404
Just tell Nanà.
Why don't you listen?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.448
Why give him money?

33:59.579 --> 34:01.286
Now that your dad is gone

34:01.414 --> 34:03.326
you think you're the boss?

34:04.626 --> 34:06.288
That's what you think?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.289
Move it.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.036
Listen to the word.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.402
Stop it.
You're hurting me.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.742
The fuck do you want?

34:39.869 --> 34:41.576
Read this.

34:41.705 --> 34:42.536
You read it!

34:42.664 --> 34:45.077
I know how to read now?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.540
"The number's available now."

34:54.676 --> 34:56.042
You can call back.

34:58.054 --> 34:58.885
Go away.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.973
No "Thank you"?
Go fuck yourself.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.600
Hello?

35:06.646 --> 35:08.433
About the car...

35:10.233 --> 35:12.771
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you tonight.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.234
No, not there.
At the station.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.741
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.079
Alright.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.243
Okay, bye.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.169
I can't stick out
my hand no more.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.011
I said no.
- Fuck you.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.051
I won't use
my hand no more.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.765
I'm not giving you shit,
will I?

36:26.893 --> 36:28.634
Fuck you guys, okay.
Fuck you.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.429
Fuck you.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.896
Fuck you guys.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.765
Oh, shit.
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.062
I'm sorry, okay?
- Okay.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.275
I'm sorry.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.235
What's up?

36:38.363 --> 36:39.899
You know this fuckin' guy?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.272
He's an asshole.

36:41.408 --> 36:43.070
But you are cute.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.367
Go.

36:45.495 --> 36:46.451
Fuck you both.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.662
Fuck you two guys.
- Go use your money.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.541
She's an asshole.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.119
I heard about your brother.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.917
Is he okay?
- Yeah.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.291
- Why are you here?
- I was looking for you.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.918
- Me?
- Yes.

37:02.053 --> 37:02.839
Why?

37:02.971 --> 37:04.678
I need a hand.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.226
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.556
Yes, I'm coming.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.812
I need about...

37:17.944 --> 37:19.731
20 minutes.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.650
Okay? Bye.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.241
Now, try the two wires.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.463
And that's how it's done.
- Okay.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.715
Okay, bye.

37:41.843 --> 37:42.799
Wait!

37:42.927 --> 37:43.963
Where are you going?

37:44.095 --> 37:46.678
- To take the car.
- You can't drive.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.547
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a kid.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.517
- What kid?
- Find somebody else.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.227
Wait.
Where are you going?

37:58.693 --> 38:00.559
I can drive.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.907
Let's go.
It's late.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.166
Okay, bye.

38:25.887 --> 38:26.877
That's enough.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.220
Okay, enough.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.056
Come here.
Look at me. In the eyes.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.642
This is it.

38:34.270 --> 38:37.809
I don't want to go to jail
or back to Burkina Faso.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.275
And I don't want them
to send you away.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.734
Okay, enough.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.739
- Understand?
- Yes.

38:50.495 --> 38:53.033
- Understand what I said?
- Yes.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.787
Thank you, really.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.867
Are you the guy from Torino?

39:32.996 --> 39:34.703
- And who are you?
- The guy with the car.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.413
Where's my car?

39:36.541 --> 39:38.328
Where's my money?

39:46.342 --> 39:48.208
It's all there.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.681
That's 300.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.675
You have to give me 10.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.052
- Ten more?
- Yes.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.678
But we said 300.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.726
Look, this is the station.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.350
Take your train,
and go home.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.819
- Yeah, after I get the car.
- No, it stays with me.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.734
But we said 300.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.653
Come back here.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.829
I knew I shouldn't
have come to Gioia.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.999
Here, this makes 310.

40:21.878 --> 40:22.743
Where is my car?

40:22.879 --> 40:25.622
- On Vico Torre, over there.
- Where is that?

40:25.757 --> 40:27.123
Near Palazzo Verde.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.419
But I am not from Gioia!

40:28.551 --> 40:30.793
You'll find the car.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.087
Unbelievable.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.001
Hey.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.137
Stop it.
Give it back.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.597
C'mon, you're not
an idiot like him.

41:17.725 --> 41:18.636
I'm an idiot?

41:18.768 --> 41:21.556
You throw my phone in the fire
and I'm the idiot?

41:21.688 --> 41:24.305
It's nothing.
I'll buy it from you.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.227
How much do you want?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.310
- Where did you get that?
- At the bank.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.107
Yeah, right...

41:31.906 --> 41:34.398
- I'm serious.
- Tomorrow, let's go, me and you?

41:34.534 --> 41:37.777
Right.
Wake up and we'll go.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.030
How much did you get?

41:41.165 --> 41:42.952
I'll give you 200 for it.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.458
You want this?

41:45.586 --> 41:47.543
Stop it.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.752
Stop it, Pio!

41:52.552 --> 41:53.793
Gimme 10 euro.

41:53.928 --> 41:57.137
Yeah, sure.
How about 50?

41:57.265 --> 41:59.598
C'mon,
give me 5 euro.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.843
Only if you hose
your dirty ass.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.810
Man, you're ugly.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.804
Man, your face is black.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.932
Yeah,
and girls want you?

42:08.067 --> 42:09.228
You're talking?

42:09.360 --> 42:11.522
You have teeth
like an excavator.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.737
Okay, I'm going home.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.857
- You can't go home!
- Why?

42:15.992 --> 42:18.780
Because they're talking.
They kicked me out.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.573
'Cause you're
a stupid little kid.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.446
Okay, enough.
Go.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.039
Go wash yourself!

42:33.968 --> 42:36.426
Pio, where the fuck
did you go?

42:37.513 --> 42:38.754
I told you...

42:38.890 --> 42:41.052
give Nanà the car
and come back.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.642
I've been waiting two hours.
Where the fuck did you go?

42:50.651 --> 42:53.143
- And this money?
- From the car.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.144
- From the car?
- Yeah.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.566
How could you risk it?

42:55.698 --> 42:57.690
I'm worried sick
about your brother,

42:57.825 --> 42:59.532
and you're gonna go
get arrested?

43:00.495 --> 43:02.953
- How did you take the car?
- By myself.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.118
By yourself?
And if the cops saw you?

43:05.249 --> 43:06.330
They'd say nothing.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.542
Right,
they'd buy you a coffee.

43:08.669 --> 43:12.003
The whole family in jail...

43:12.131 --> 43:13.747
They'll arrest you too,

43:13.883 --> 43:15.920
the whole family will
be in jail.

43:16.052 --> 43:17.714
I'll be the only one out.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.588
And how will I go on?

43:20.723 --> 43:22.806
Grandma,
he brought you the money.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.472
Get the hell outta here.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.844
Get out.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.638
You're gonna drive me crazy,
understand?

43:29.774 --> 43:34.109
I've been waiting two hours.
I didn't know what to think.

43:34.237 --> 43:36.604
How dare you risk it?

43:36.739 --> 43:39.857
Because if I gave it to Nanà,
he would steal our money.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.699
Why the hell
should I do that?

43:41.828 --> 43:45.117
Why did you do it?
I'll smash you face,

43:45.248 --> 43:46.614
because you don't
listen to me.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.116
Well, I brought you
the money...

43:49.252 --> 43:50.914
now I'm out.

43:51.712 --> 43:52.828
Where are you going?

43:53.506 --> 43:54.917
Around.

43:55.299 --> 43:58.758
I'm going crazy here.
I'm gonna die.

44:00.471 --> 44:01.757
<i>Pio,
where are you going?</i>

44:01.889 --> 44:03.505
Up top.

44:42.471 --> 44:43.552
Fifty.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.297
Five euro.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.095
Cheers.
- Cheers.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.132
Good evening, ma'am.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.967
<i>We have a warrant.</i>

45:23.221 --> 45:25.508
<i>We're looking for
the copper you stole.</i>

45:26.849 --> 45:28.886
<i>At this time of night?</i>

46:07.723 --> 46:10.261
Here's the electricity fine.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.804
Keep looking.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.432
Yeah, keep looking
and you'll find everything.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.484
Who's this boy?

46:21.612 --> 46:22.773
My son.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.112
Let's go.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.700
Ma'am, this won't be
the last time.

46:44.093 --> 46:45.425
It's for the electricity.

46:45.553 --> 46:46.839
How much?

46:46.971 --> 46:49.258
- Nine thousand euros.
- Nine thousand euros?

46:50.891 --> 46:52.928
Is there time to pay?

47:01.485 --> 47:03.351
What are we gonna do?

49:51.947 --> 49:54.781
Hey. Yo!
Have you seen Ayiva?

49:54.909 --> 49:57.572
He's around somewhere.

50:16.972 --> 50:19.134
Have you seen Ayiva?

50:28.442 --> 50:30.980
Have you seen Ayiva?

50:34.365 --> 50:36.231
No, no.

51:08.691 --> 51:11.058
Your friend is here.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.449
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

51:27.585 --> 51:28.996
I have to tell you something.

51:29.128 --> 51:30.460
What?

51:30.588 --> 51:32.500
I have to tell you something.

51:41.390 --> 51:42.597
It's good.

51:42.725 --> 51:44.682
- How much?
- One hundred.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.767
One hundred?

51:46.895 --> 51:48.602
I don't really need it.

51:48.731 --> 51:50.688
You know anybody
who wants it?

51:51.817 --> 51:54.230
I need the money,
can you find someone?

51:57.656 --> 51:58.692
Jennifer.

51:58.824 --> 52:00.781
Rich girl, come here!

52:03.287 --> 52:05.153
Hey, you sticky guy,
you remember me?

52:06.582 --> 52:08.699
It's new.
Everything is okay.

52:08.834 --> 52:10.746
- Yeah, it's nice.
- One hundred.

52:10.878 --> 52:11.789
- How much?
- One hundred.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.661
No, no, no, no.
It's too much.

52:13.797 --> 52:14.878
I can't
- C'mon.

52:15.591 --> 52:17.958
Maybe you know someone...
You said you'd buy now...

52:18.093 --> 52:19.755
Okay,
maybe Aniber wants it.

52:19.887 --> 52:20.502
Where is she?

52:20.638 --> 52:22.721
Rosarno.
Come, lets go.

52:22.848 --> 52:24.089
There's a train now.
Lets go.

52:24.224 --> 52:26.386
- Maybe 10 minutes.
- Yeah, there's a train.

52:26.518 --> 52:27.554
Ten minutes, there's a train.
Lets go.

52:27.686 --> 52:28.847
- Where?
- Let's go.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.891
- Where are we going?
- To Rosarno.

52:31.023 --> 52:32.639
- How?
- By train.

52:32.775 --> 52:35.267
No way,
I'm not going.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.523
You wanna sell it?

52:37.655 --> 52:39.396
Trains go fast.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.023
I'm afraid.
I'm not going.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.767
Hey, Aniber.

53:10.396 --> 53:11.603
Hey, Aniber.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.477
Hey, what's up?

53:16.235 --> 53:17.851
I'm not going in there.

53:19.571 --> 53:20.311
Why?

53:20.447 --> 53:22.279
I'm embarrassed.

53:23.158 --> 53:24.899
Gimme this.

53:27.287 --> 53:30.200
I'll wait for you
on the bike, okay?

53:38.632 --> 53:39.839
How are you?

53:39.967 --> 53:41.583
I want to sell this one.

53:53.689 --> 53:55.430
- Want some beer?
- No.

53:55.566 --> 53:56.977
How much did you get?

53:57.109 --> 53:58.099
Seventy.

53:58.235 --> 54:00.067
Seventy?
I told you 100!

54:00.195 --> 54:01.731
It's 70.

54:01.864 --> 54:03.105
Here.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.902
And this is for gas.
- No, no.

54:05.033 --> 54:06.444
- Stop it, Pio.
- No.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.409
- Stop it.
- Give it to me!

54:08.537 --> 54:10.119
- Stop it!
- No.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.364
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

54:12.499 --> 54:13.831
- Really?
- Yes. Gimme.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.951
Okay.
Here, keep it.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.873
And watch this.

54:23.135 --> 54:26.424
Use it to buy a train ticket
and go home. Okay?

54:28.766 --> 54:30.678
Where the fuck
are you going?

54:51.205 --> 54:53.913
Hurry up,
last train's about to leave.

55:02.925 --> 55:05.417
It's the last one, otherwise
you're sleeping here.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.875
Okay, I'll take you home now.
C'mon.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.538
See?

56:33.682 --> 56:35.139
Start it.

56:40.439 --> 56:41.805
Start it!

58:12.948 --> 58:14.610
Grandpa,
wanna go for a ride?

58:14.741 --> 58:16.698
No, I'm embarrassed.

58:53.447 --> 58:55.279
Let's go make
some money?

59:01.955 --> 59:03.571
I have to finish something.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.324
Give it to me.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.261
Are you okay?

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.253
Yeah.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.847
Was that your wife
and daughter?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:04.715
No.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.717
My sister
and my daughter.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.640
And your wife?

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.604
It's only the 3 of us.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.145
You smoke?

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.268
Smoke what?

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.145
What? Look.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.364
Oh no, not this.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.357
- Why not?
- It's bad for you.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.485
It's bad?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.485
Try this one.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.910
Smoking cigarettes
isn't good either.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.749
Wow, wow, wow.
Nice machine.

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:14.744
Machine here, nice.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.297
- Where did you find this?
- Around.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.382
- Around?
- Yes.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.002
If you say so.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.050
Actually, I need a TV.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.718
What did he say?

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.759
He's speaking Italian.
He needs a TV.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.602
This one is good for me...

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.347
but only for me.

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:38.977
I need a TV,
big enough for everyone,

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:43.152
because there's a big game.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.038
What did he say?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.757
What?

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.547
What did he say?

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.346
He says he needs a TV.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.224
I have one,
but I can't bring it today,

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.469
- 'cause I have to work.
- I'll do it.

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:15.146
What are you saying?

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.515
I'll bring it on my own.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.142
By yourself?

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:22.728
Alone...

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.906
- Two hundred. Say 200 for everything.
- What did he say?

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:27.650
Two hundred for everything.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.072
Okay.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.445
Two hundred... everything...

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.196
No, no.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:40.171
Four hundred...
Four hundred.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:42.164
He said 400.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:42.756
I'll come.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:45.046
I can't wait here for you.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.339
If it's tomorrow,
no deal.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.303
No, now.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.215
I swear!

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.224
You said, "I swear."

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:56.930
You know how we say it
in my country?

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.897
If you say, "I swear,"

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.937
you say, "wallai!"

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:02.480
Wallai.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.190
Now that you said,
"wallai,"

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.318
you have to bring it tonight.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.702
Okay. I'll see you.
Wallai.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.447
I'll be waiting for you.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.907
- Wallai.
- I'll be waiting.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.502
Wallai.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.385
What's all this stuff?

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.387
I wanna fill this up.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:41.891
When it's full,
I'll get a container,

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.234
send it to Burkina.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.523
I'll sell it all
and I'll be set.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.774
It's called "business."

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.195
Here.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.238
Here it is.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.460
You seem off.
What's up?

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:03.663
I'm fine.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.837
You know, life is a bit
complicated.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:09.506
Sometimes you think
you're moving ahead,

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.795
and then you hit
a setback.

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:16.012
It'd be easier
if you took the train.

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:22.394
Well, gotta go to work.
How will you carry it?

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.233
You still work where
my sister used to work?

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.604
Sometimes,
when they need me.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:28.900
That house is beautiful.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.898
Real money in there.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.612
You worry about this TV,
and nothing else.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:36.954
How will you carry it?

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.247
Like this.
See?

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.878
You'd make a perfect
African woman.

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.794
I'll put you in the container
and send you to Africa.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.212
You'll be good there.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.585
Bye.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:53.174
Oh!

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.842
Bring it to Kingsley!

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.761
Okay.

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:17.411
Klingsely.

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.367
What?

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:20.831
Kleens.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.746
- Who?
- Kleens.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.459
The fuck's his name?
He was here before.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.582
You mean Kingsley?

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:30.707
Where?

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.927
- He's at the bar.
- Which bar?

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.261
Just over there.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:35.755
Where?

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.843
Let's go.
I'll show you.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.109
Kingsley.
Kingsley.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.487
He's looking for you.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.072
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.115
Nice.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:00.909
Benjamin.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.165
We have a TV now, boy.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.329
Yeah, thank you.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.542
Give me the money
and I'll go.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.385
No, no, no.
Come and sit down.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.755
- No, just gimme the money.
- No.

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.848
I have to go.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.138
Pio, don't do this!

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.308
Yo, everyone.
He brought the TV.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.556
His name is Pio.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.149
Pio. Pio. Pio...

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.688
Pio. Pio. Pio...

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.407
Let's go.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.948
Pio. Pio. Pio...

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.497
Aniber,

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:45.412
give me two beers.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.418
Your beer.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:55.384
Pio. Pio. Pio...

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:00.972
Hey.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:01.931
Hey, white boy.
Come here

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.768
Come here, white boy.
Come here. Come here.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.304
Get the fuck out for him,
okay?

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.101
Get out of here, okay?

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:09.519
Come, come, come.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.061
How are you?

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.107
You good?

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:17.197
You see all these people?

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:18.736
They are from Ghana.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.077
I am Nigerian.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.868
- Where are you from?
- Gioia.

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:26.115
Gioia Tauro?

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.913
You're a gypsy, no?

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.919
I like gypsies,
you know?

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.042
Good.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:34.919
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.007
No.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.626
Why not?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.763
You're handsome,
why no girlfriend?

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.652
Pio brought us luck!

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.620
Hope Ghana!

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:09.458
Hope Ghana!
Hope Ghana!

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:13.500
Pio, Pio, Pio, Pio...

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:18.755
No, no, no, no.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.502
You sure?

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.550
Yeah, give it.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.098
C'mon, give it to me.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.685
You're good.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.653
I like you like that.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:10.598
- You? Here?
- Yes.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.221
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:15.273
The fuck you're doing here?

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.233
- He's just kidding, okay.
- Kidding, man.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:18.978
Just having fun.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.108
You're not at work?

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.526
- At work?
- Yeah.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.615
You know what time it is?

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.029
Yeah, he's just having fun,
okay?

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:30.158
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.032
Are you okay?

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.375
Wallai.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.960
Wallai?

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.670
Wallai, he's good!

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:38.505
Wallai!

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:48.348
Wallai!
Wallai!

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.636
You're okay?

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:12.414
Ah...

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:18.204
Good boy.

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:20.998
You're a good boy.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.509
You're tired?

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.753
You smell like beer.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:31.099
Oh ma,
what do you want?

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.677
You smell like beer.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.847
Did you drink beer?
- No.

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:39.274
- Are you sure?
- No.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.897
You smell like beer,
get out of here.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:53.948
You'll make him sick.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.746
You'll make him sick.
You'll make him sick.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:57.789
You'll make him sick.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.661
He's gonna choke.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.089
You're too rough.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.382
I'll kill him.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.722
You're crazy dear,
lock yourself up.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.807
Pio, Pio, Pio.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.930
Pass the ball!

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.394
Pio, Pio.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.440
<i>Pio.</i>

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.697
Grandpa's in the garage.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.908
Go give him a hand
with the car.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:18.745
Pio, Pio.
I was born in that thing.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:24.504
Pio, come here.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.498
Pio, come.

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:35.808
Once, we were always
on the road.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.143
On the road.

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.105
We were free,
we didn't have bosses.

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:44.475
We answered to no one.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.102
We were free,
always on the road.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.109
Now, we are here.

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.616
Remember,

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:56.324
It's us...

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:57.821
against the world.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:00.665
Against the world.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.640
What the fuck?

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.437
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:26.979
You wanna get hit?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:28.227
Sorry.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.274
Get the fuck outta here.

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.736
Hands off the car.
Get out.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.036
What's up?

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:25.959
Nothing.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.591
Do a lot of Africans
have cars?

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.184
Some, but not many.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:46.680
Why?

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:50.809
Why don't we take some cars
and sell them the parts?

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.494
Stop thinking about
stealing cars.

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:09.919
Let's go.

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:48.077
Pio. Pio.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:50.743
It's important.
Wake up.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.690
Dear brothers,

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.481
before proceeding
to our Christian

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.854
rite of burial,

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:49.279
we faithfully plead with God,
our Father.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:52.911
Everything lives in Him
and for Him.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:55.867
Brothers,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.370
we entrust to the earth
the mortal body of Emiliano,

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:03.212
waiting for his resurrection.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:05.916
My God receive his soul

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:08.885
in glorious communion
with the saints.

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:12.051
May He open his arms
with mercy,

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:16.142
so that our brother Emilano,
redeemed from death,

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:20.059
absolved of any guilt,
reconciled with his Father...

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:23.808
They're letting us out early.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.108
We entrust our prayer
to his relatives.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:29.822
The daughter, Lolanda,

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.907
her husband, Rocco,

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:33.868
their children, Simona,

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.204
Antonella, Susanna,

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.539
Riccardo,

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.749
Cosimo and Pio.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.786
Their grandchildren,
Nicolas Damiano,

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:44.878
Patrizia, Cosimo,

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:46.589
Gesuele Massimo,

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:47.924
Cristina.

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:50.044
And Francesco Pio.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.013
And his other daughter,
Simona.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.451
Why don't you tell me
about prison?

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:43.619
Why the fuck
do you care, Pio?

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:47.543
While you were in jail,

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:50.038
I brought home the bread.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.169
Why don't we do
something together?

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.887
What the fuck do you want?

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.348
- Tell me.
- Let's go steal together.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:05.353
You're a kid, Pio.
Where are you gonna go?

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:07.313
Tell me, where?

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:11.518
Don't give me that shit.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.236
You're gonna deal
with the "Italians" now?

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:16.401
I'm not afraid of them.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.369
Get out.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.739
You're pissing me off.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.241
Out. Out!

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.243
Stop bothering me.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.455
Out.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.940
Sorry, my ball went over.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.025
And what do you want
at this time of night?

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.769
To play soccer?

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:38.938
Come on,
he's just a kid.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.736
Go get it.

01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:43.575
Hurry up, Dad,
I'm hungry.

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:46.579
Okay.

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:13.889
Here it is.
- Thank you.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.312
Go to another street.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.561
Next time
I'm gonna slash it.

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:19.187
Understand?

01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:02.256
Why are you here?

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.376
- The ball.
- Come here.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.961
And you just come into
people's houses?

01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.929
How dare you come in here?

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:10.298
What are you trying to do?

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:12.096
Getting the ball.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:14.222
Are you sure?

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:15.811
Yes.

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.897
And what's this bag?

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:24.437
Bring it here.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:27.532
You took something from me?

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.516
Tell them what you did.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.022
Tell your father
what you did.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:48.317
If he doesn't give me satisfaction,
I'll take it myself.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:51.817
I pretended to get my ball...

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:55.036
I saw a computer,
a photo,

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.825
and I took them.

01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:00.787
And?

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.288
Speak.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.956
Tell them what else.

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.542
Tell your mother
what you did.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:14.054
You know how long
I've known your family?

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:16.048
And you wanna
come in my house?

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.093
And he tried to trick me.

01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:21.972
He said,
"please give me my ball."

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:24.815
I was in a hurry
to go eat with my family.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:28.357
But I stopped
to get him his ball.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:35.159
Don't you ever come
to my house again.

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:38.036
Or you'll be dead
on the floor.

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:39.697
You understand?

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:42.701
If he didn't know you,
he would've killed you tonight.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:44.751
You don't do these things.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.794
Thank God I know your family.
Your brother...

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.341
or you wouldn't have
had a good night.

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.552
Understand?

01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:56.342
Tell everybody you're sorry.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:58.682
- I'm sorry.
- To everyone.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.389
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:07.100
Rocco, I expect to be paid
for all the damages.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.101
How much?

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:12.605
Seven or eight thousand.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:15.950
I expect you to pay it.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:19.070
We'll pay whatever...
no problem.

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:20.537
What can I do?

01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.531
You are a disgrace.

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.577
This will never happen again,
Rocco.

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:27.958
Steal from my house,

01:30:28.798 --> 01:30:31.882
or any of my people?

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:34.335
Please bring me my jacket.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.476
You'll learn how to behave.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:49.688
You'll see what happens.

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:52.236
Goodbye and goodnight.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.151
Goodnight.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:04.073
Get out!

01:31:05.418 --> 01:31:07.580
You're not sleeping here.

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:13.882
Get out.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.090
Go easy.

01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:22.679
Let me in!

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:24.928
Don't come back.

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:26.725
Hey!

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:31.522
Hey! Hey!

01:33:11.377 --> 01:33:13.369
Get some water.

01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:43.608
Where are you going, Pio?

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:45.154
Pio.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.993
Where are you going?

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.992
Hey, sticky guy.
What's up?

01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:36.835
Ayiva?

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:43.083
Ayiva.

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:45.885
Ayiva.

01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.684
The kid can't stay here.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:53.848
We're squatting.

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.810
Just for tonight.

01:34:58.193 --> 01:34:59.729
What's going on?

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:01.818
Nothing.

01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:03.403
Try to get some sleep.

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.989
Are they talking?
About what?

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:07.904
You can stay here tonight.

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:10.194
Get some sleep.

01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:12.367
But promise me one thing.

01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:15.081
Call your parents tomorrow,

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.076
tell them you're okay,
and you will come home.

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:18.168
Okay.

01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:21.376
- Promise?
- Yes.

01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:23.373
Thank you, Ayiva.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.117
What is it?

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:39.450
You wanna know how it is?

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.503
In Palmi prison,

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.714
they take care of you.

01:36:47.927 --> 01:36:50.419
They all respect you in there.

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.966
Not the Africans.

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:58.303
They get no respect.

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:02.807
No one even looks at them.

01:37:02.942 --> 01:37:04.308
But us...

01:37:04.444 --> 01:37:07.357
they all respect us!

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:10.196
Even the "Italians"
respect us.

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:16.491
There was a guy
who was in prison in Brazil.

01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:23.790
Down there, they piss
and shit in their cells.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.584
They tie themselves up
so they don't fall in their shit.

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.923
They're like animals
down there.

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:39.802
You messed up, Pio.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:53.615
What are we gonna do?

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.739
I don't know.

01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:00.413
You wanna do
something with me?

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.952
Let's do this thing...

01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:07.296
and it'll make everything okay.

01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:10.086
Okay.

01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:12.130
- Huh?
- Okay.

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:16.381
You understand?

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:18.219
Huh?

01:38:44.544 --> 01:38:45.751
What are we doing here?

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:48.621
My friend will come
with a truck.

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.668
I'll help him.

01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:53.959
He'll pay us immediately.

01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:57.175
I'm not gonna do that to him.

01:38:57.306 --> 01:39:00.424
Stop it with this African, Pio.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.301
Why are you still
calling him that?

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:05.350
We have to think about us

01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:08.019
and you're worried about
the African?

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:09.600
There's another way.

01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:11.146
Not this.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:13.771
You know there's
no other way.

01:39:13.906 --> 01:39:17.570
They won't let you back
in the Ciambra, Pio.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.319
Call him
and get him outta there.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.494
We do this
and we'll be okay.

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.788
I'm not doing it.
That's it.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.832
Don't be a baby, Pio.

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:33.081
They come with the truck,

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:36.460
Take everything
and pay us immediately.

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:40.468
Just say the word.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.933
He trusts you, Pio.

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:42.196
Why don't you come home?

01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:55.877
I love you.

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.484
What happened?

01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:26.036
Tell me.

01:46:28.465 --> 01:46:29.751
You're scaring me.

01:47:16.138 --> 01:47:18.255
Can you take me home?

01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.109
See?
Everything is fine.

01:49:04.163 --> 01:49:05.370
Are you okay, Pio?

01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:07.955
Pio?

01:49:08.083 --> 01:49:09.915
Are you hurt?

01:49:13.630 --> 01:49:15.292
You did good.

01:49:18.427 --> 01:49:20.134
You're almost a man now.

01:49:20.262 --> 01:49:21.844
I'm already a man.

01:49:23.348 --> 01:49:24.884
Really?

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:26.887
You're a man, Pio?

01:49:28.187 --> 01:49:29.644
Yes.

01:49:52.002 --> 01:49:53.493
Wait here.

01:49:54.546 --> 01:49:55.502
Good evening.

01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:57.213
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:04.505
So, my brother
never fucked a woman.

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:05.926
Never.

01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.346
Yes, yes.

01:50:10.145 --> 01:50:13.013
Not me.
I know this boy.

01:50:14.566 --> 01:50:15.602
I'll do it.

01:50:15.734 --> 01:50:17.896
- Sure? Hundred percent?
- Yes.

01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:19.860
- Can I call him?
- Yes.

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:27.361
Let's see if
you're a real man.

01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:43.168
Come in here.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.168
- What happened?
- I fell.

01:51:59.296 --> 01:52:02.004
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

01:52:02.132 --> 01:52:03.293
You're okay?

01:52:03.425 --> 01:52:05.633
You sure?

01:52:05.761 --> 01:52:06.717
You go fast.

01:52:06.845 --> 01:52:09.428
There's no need.
You could hurt yourself.

01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:19.514
<i>Pio...</i>

01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:21.266
<i>come here!</i>

01:52:22.694 --> 01:52:24.356
Go, Pio.

01:52:41.255 --> 01:52:42.666
Come here.

01:52:43.632 --> 01:52:45.464
Pio, come.

01:52:46.635 --> 01:52:48.342
Pio...
