00:28.661 --> 00:30.561
Where you gonna be 10 years from now?

00:30.663 --> 00:33.723
Ten years from now,
where do I wanna be?

00:33.833 --> 00:39.169
I wanna be... just living, man.
Just living comfortably with my wife, you know.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.503
Just layin' back. Just chilling.
You know what I'm saying? Living.

00:42.609 --> 00:46.511
Where do I think I'll be in 10 years?

00:46.613 --> 00:50.845
I don't think I'll be seeing it, dog, for real, man.
I don't think my luck is that good.

00:50.950 --> 00:54.647
I hope it is, but if it ain't,
so be it. I'm ready.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.725
¶ Come on, hah, sicker than your average poppa ¶

01:05.832 --> 01:08.858
¶ Twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink ¶

01:08.968 --> 01:10.868
¶ Pink gators

01:10.970 --> 01:13.564
- Puffy! Congratulations!
- ¶ Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn ¶

01:13.673 --> 01:16.267
¶ Dead right, if they head right
Biggie there every night ¶

01:16.376 --> 01:18.867
¶ Poppa been smooth
since days of Underoos ¶

01:18.978 --> 01:21.811
Can't wait for the new al bum, man.
Congratulations.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.784
Yeah!

01:27.087 --> 01:29.021
Yo, Big, let's change the world.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.190
Let's roll. Let's roll, y'all.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.198
You needa real man.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.537
- We back, baby. We back!
- No doubt.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.806
We back on top, baby!

01:56.249 --> 01:59.685
- Yo, what's up, ma?
- What's up?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.516
You looking fine.
I'm going to have to get your number.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.920
I don't know.
What's up with you?

02:05.758 --> 02:08.727
In the beginning...

02:08.828 --> 02:11.160
God gave me a clean slate.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.034
But where I grew up,
I knew I couldn't stay clean.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.044
If you was a nice, ordinary kid...

02:26.146 --> 02:30.014
you was an easy mark for the wanna be gangsters
and cutthroat girls in the school yard.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.209
- You wanna check out this magazine?
- Right on. Let's go.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.310
Fab 5 Freddy. There we go.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.754
Kurtis Blow, man!
He's the man! You know-

02:38.858 --> 02:43.022
¶ Clap your hands, everybody
lf you got what it takes ¶

02:43.129 --> 02:47.566
¶ 'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow
and I want you to know that these are the breaks ¶

02:47.667 --> 02:49.567
¶ Break it up, break it up

02:49.669 --> 02:51.398
- There we go.
- Yeah.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.870
I know.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.498
Y'all want our autograph?
We gonna be in a magazine one day.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.941
Chris Shy-ass can't be in no magazine.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.240
He's too fat, black and ugly.

03:04.484 --> 03:08.284
At least there ain't
no train tracks in my mouth.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.289
What do I tell you?
If you just pay attention...

03:11.391 --> 03:15.555
you study hard, always do your best
and look what happens.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.358
A hundred percent!

03:18.464 --> 03:21.695
- I'm proud of you, Chrissy-poo.
- Don't call me that!

03:21.801 --> 03:25.134
Oh, I forgot.
You're all grown-up now, huh?

03:25.238 --> 03:28.639
My moms was from a small town in Jamaica...

03:28.741 --> 03:31.301
where they left the doors
unlocked at night.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.039
But in our neighborhood,
the only time she let me off the stoop...

03:34.147 --> 03:36.081
was when she walked me home from school.

03:36.182 --> 03:40.585
We've seen that 12, 13 times.
Don't you wanna see something different?

03:40.687 --> 03:44.214
This was Brooklyn. Do-or-die Bed-Stuy.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.384
And there was just some shit
Moms couldn't protect me from.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.195
Voletta.

03:56.436 --> 04:01.430
Christopher, say hello to your father.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.077
Sugar?

04:17.055 --> 04:19.422
A hundred dollars.

04:19.524 --> 04:22.494
Is that all he's worth to you?

04:23.630 --> 04:26.758
Are you even planning on
being in his life?

04:26.866 --> 04:29.494
- Thin gs are complicated.
- Things?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.502
I feel like if you and I could just...

04:33.039 --> 04:35.371
It was easy to lie about your wife.

04:35.475 --> 04:39.104
Now, when it comes to your child,
"things"are complicated.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.341
Bye, Voletta.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.680
You for got something.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.833
What's up, y'all?

05:02.935 --> 05:04.960
This is Super Rocking
Mr. Magic holding it down.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.539
This is DJ Marley Marl.
- Check it out, y'all.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.541
- It's all the way live.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.342
He ain't coming back, is he?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.885
No. I don't believe so.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.982
Good. I'm glad.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.323
Oh.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.388
Come here.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.642
We're gonna be all right, just you and me.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.404
¶ You ain't no pops to me ¶

05:49.515 --> 05:52.348
¶ You just some nigga
sipping on tea ¶

05:52.452 --> 05:56.252
¶ Moms don't want your money
so run and flee ¶

05:57.490 --> 05:59.685
Flee...

05:59.792 --> 06:03.558
¶ Back all hunched over
'cause you gotta admit ¶

06:03.663 --> 06:06.359
¶ I don't need you in my life
'cause you ain't shit ¶¶

06:21.147 --> 06:23.047
Right then and there...

06:23.149 --> 06:26.243
I decided to stop being
that little kid on the stoop.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.789
I knew life was a fucked-up game...

06:38.898 --> 06:43.631
and I knew D Roc was fucked up enough
to show me how to play.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.363
- What's up, D Roc?
- What up, big boy?

06:46.873 --> 06:50.172
- Your mama finally let you out the house?
- Told you I would come.

06:50.276 --> 06:53.939
- I ain't on lockdown like that.
- So you ready to be a big baller?

06:54.046 --> 06:56.514
What I gotta do?

06:59.118 --> 07:01.313
Remember, just act like
you slapping the nigga five.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.517
¶ Five, six
One, one, two, two, three ¶

07:05.625 --> 07:09.857
¶ Four, four, five, six
One, two, three, four, five ¶

07:09.962 --> 07:12.089
The phone is ringing.

07:19.639 --> 07:23.097
Motherfuckers got
addicted to crack after they first hit...

07:23.209 --> 07:25.734
but I got addicted to money
after my first sale.

07:25.845 --> 07:31.477
By the time I was 17,,
I wasn't no ordinary kid. I was paid.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.779
Christopher, you're not still
lying in that bed, are you?

07:33.886 --> 07:34.944
No.

07:35.054 --> 07:37.022
Christopher, what are you doing?

07:37.123 --> 07:41.150
You saying your prayers?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.160
Praying that God teaches you how to knock.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.992
Please. Don't you mock your prayers.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.032
You don't think Jehovah
has a sense of humor?

07:48.134 --> 07:52.730
He must have, if he made you.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.707
We always gotta listen
to this corny old country music?

07:56.809 --> 08:00.506
I happen to like this music.
They tell good stories.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.980
So, who were you yappin'
on the phone with last night?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.914
Jan.

08:06.018 --> 08:08.680
It's perfectly normal
for a mother to feel jealous...

08:08.788 --> 08:10.688
when her son cares about another female.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.190
Oh, for crying out loud!

08:13.292 --> 08:14.987
By the way, Ma...

08:15.094 --> 08:16.994
- What?
- How much does a garbage collector make?

08:17.096 --> 08:19.394
I think about 28,000 a year. Why?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.696
- No reason.
- Would you hurry up before you make us both late for class?

08:26.472 --> 08:28.997
- Hey, Voletta. Is that the new Watchtower?
- Of course.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.372
We gonna see you this weekend, right?

08:31.477 --> 08:34.344
¶ "W" for Wallace
Rappers are demolished ¶

08:34.447 --> 08:37.347

08:37.450 --> 08:40.044

08:48.528 --> 08:49.961
¶ Rappers are demolished ¶

08:50.062 --> 08:52.360
¶ Wax 'em and buff'em
like polish ¶

08:52.465 --> 08:54.695
Shit!

09:12.184 --> 09:14.812
You need to add 3X to the other side.

09:14.921 --> 09:18.584
Now, you need to solve the problem for X.
Who wants to come up and do that?

09:22.428 --> 09:25.795
Come on up, Mr. Wallace.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.472
7X equals 84...

09:34.574 --> 09:37.941
then 12 equals X.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.973
Impressive. You're actually
smarter than you look.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.846
- Ooh!
- Mr. Webber.

09:45.952 --> 09:49.080
- Yesterday you said I was gonna end up a garbageman.
- That's right.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.315
Lf you keep cutting class,
that's exactly what you'll become.

09:52.692 --> 09:58.460
Well, I found out a teacher
makes 24,000 a year...

09:58.564 --> 10:02.967
and a garbageman makes 28,000 a year.

10:03.069 --> 10:08.371
I'm gonna make $4,000 more
than his dumb ass.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.999
All right. Get out.

10:12.311 --> 10:16.338
Hey! Get out of my class.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.894
Thanks for meeting up.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.331
You know you got it like that.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.369
When my moms see that phone bill,
she gonna kill me.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.635
We gotta chill with all that wild-ass phone sex.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.875
Um-

10:49.582 --> 10:52.142
I'm pregnant.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.253
I went to the doctor and everything.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.925
We gonna have a baby.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.831
- Damn.
- Damn?

11:11.337 --> 11:15.205
Is that it? I was half way hoping
you was gonna be happy.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.935
But if this fucks up your world,
then I'm sorry.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.069
Whoa, whoa.
Jan, hold up. Sit down, baby.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.079
What you talking about?
Sit down.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.877
What's wrong with you?

11:27.953 --> 11:30.285
If you're carrying my seed,
it means you are my world.

11:33.626 --> 11:37.585
- You're not sitting there thinking, "Oh, fuck"?
- No, I'm not.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.461
- You know I got you.
- You got me?

11:40.566 --> 11:44.696
No doubt.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.238
Come here.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.105
Oh, fuck.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.145
- What's up, D Roc?
- Yo, what up's, son?

12:05.825 --> 12:07.725
You okay?

12:07.827 --> 12:09.954
Yeah, I'm all right.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.054
Let's get this money then.

12:15.835 --> 12:18.429
Me and D Roc were like factory workers...

12:18.537 --> 12:20.596
and Fulton Street
was the assembly line.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.008
¶ Here we go ¶

12:27.113 --> 12:31.777
But every now and then,
D Roc would say, "Yo, can I get a rhyme?"

12:31.884 --> 12:35.547
See, drug dealing was like my wife.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.713
Rapping was just some chick on the side.

12:37.823 --> 12:41.350
Before I knew it, word got out
a bout my skills and shit.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.485
Then this kid named Primo
called me out.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.032
Everyone was jocking him,
'cause he never lost a battle.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.660
It was one thing to rhyme for your boys,
but it was another to battle.

12:52.638 --> 12:56.005
- ' Bout time you stopped running.
- ' Bout time your ass stopped talking shit.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.643
- Yeah. That's Chris.
- Come on, man.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.475

13:06.085 --> 13:08.212
We got MC quest out here.
That's what- MC Quest.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.618
Come on, man. Y'all know
who the king of Fulton is.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.623
Hey, deejay, play me something nice, man.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.625
All right. Do it.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.161
I 'm gonna get some barbecue chicken
when I'm done with big boy.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.356
You sure you don't want
no barbecue chicken?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.956
¶ Now let me tell you a little story
about the P-P-Preem ¶

13:22.067 --> 13:24.035

13:44.623 --> 13:46.818
Man, get this fool out of here.

Get him downtown.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.624
Primo. Who the hell is that?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.497
What's up, Mom Dukes?

15:03.235 --> 15:08.138
So I was by Fulton Records and I thought,
"What would make Slim happy??"

15:08.240 --> 15:11.300
So I bought you the corniest
country album I could find.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.914
In the last month,
you have missed 20 days of school.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.484
All right. Look.
I tried, Ma.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.786
I missed a few days.
But I went back three weeks straight.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.757
Then three people came to
my class on career day:

15:28.861 --> 15:31.125
A computer technician,
a store owner, a doctor...

15:31.230 --> 15:35.257
- and they all looked like poor, broke-down niggas.
- You watch your mouth.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.699
I can't see myself going to
school to end up like them...

15:37.803 --> 15:39.703
'cause I got something to do right now.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.500
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.132
Jan's pregnant.
I'm gonna be a father.

15:48.614 --> 15:53.278
Please tell me that you are not that stupid.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.649
Why would you even say
something like that?

15:55.754 --> 15:58.484
Because you are still a damn boy.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.024
Is this why you think
I came to the States-

16:01.126 --> 16:05.324
So I can spend all my days
taking care of you, feeding you?

16:05.431 --> 16:08.889
Cleaning up old plates of mashed potatoes
you leave underyour bed?

16:09.001 --> 16:11.094
- What?
- You can't take care of your self.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.831
- How are you gonna take care of a baby?
- What did you do with it?

16:13.939 --> 16:17.136
- Where's the plate?
- I threw it in the trash. It was disgusting.

16:17.242 --> 16:20.336
It's my work, man.

16:20.446 --> 16:24.075
- What are you doing?
- Those wasn't no damn mashed potatoes, all right?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.918
Look at me.
I said, "Look at me."

16:33.759 --> 16:36.421
Are you telling me
what I think you're telling me?

16:40.666 --> 16:45.763
Boy, you gonna end up like those
worthless bums you hang with.

16:45.871 --> 16:50.171
- Don't you see that?
- Bums don't have chains, and boys don't have money. I'm a man.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.040
You think that makes you a man?

16:58.484 --> 17:00.748
Get out.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.879
- Ma.
- Get out.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.296
¶ The fuck is goin'on ¶

17:22.407 --> 17:25.775
I wasn't the man my moms wanted me to be.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.780
So fuck it. I was gonna be
the man I needed to be.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.077
¶ When I die, fuck it
I wanna go to hell ¶

17:32.184 --> 17:34.709

17:43.095 --> 17:46.030

17:46.131 --> 17:48.099

17:48.200 --> 17:50.134
I 'm telling you, Lil' Cee,

17:50.235 --> 17:52.100

17:54.406 --> 17:57.637

17:57.743 --> 18:01.577
Does this look like a Lamaze class to you?
Hey, yo, Sandy, take your ass home.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.274
- Come on!
- I got this.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.147
¶ She don't even love me like she did

18:07.252 --> 18:09.243
¶ Suckin'on her chest

18:09.354 --> 18:12.653

18:12.758 --> 18:15.352
¶ For give me for my disrespect

18:15.461 --> 18:19.022

18:26.805 --> 18:28.466
Yo! You selling crack

18:31.443 --> 18:34.344
¶ A worthless fuckin' buddha-head ¶

18:34.446 --> 18:38.610

18:47.226 --> 18:49.387
I had four young cats out on the streets.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.030
Look at you, man.
All grown up and shit.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.533
Shut the fuck up and get back by the door.

18:56.635 --> 19:00.628
I wasn't hanging with
my boys, wasn't messing with no chicks.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.731
I was too busy counting paper.

19:03.842 --> 19:07.972
But I was moving too fucking fast and I slipped up.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.584
You have a collect call from

19:14.686 --> 19:16.176
Christopher Wallace.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.017
an inmate at the Wake County Jail.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.358
Ma.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.826
Damn you, Christopher.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.160
I fucked up.
I need your help.

19:27.266 --> 19:32.260
No. You got your self into this mess.
You get your self out.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.362
I can't ask you to pray for me?

19:34.473 --> 19:36.941
I never stop praying for you.

19:37.042 --> 19:40.808
But you need to stop wasting God's time
and pray for your self.

19:46.185 --> 19:50.519
Close your eyes, Christopher.

19:50.622 --> 19:53.284
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

19:53.392 --> 19:57.055
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

19:57.162 --> 20:01.531
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

20:01.633 --> 20:06.093
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

20:06.205 --> 20:11.438
Thoupreparest a table
before me in the presence of mine enemies.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.341
My cup runneth over.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.381
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
all the days of my life.

20:17.482 --> 20:21.043
You got your self
into this mess. You get your self out.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.348
That was the first time in my life I thought...

20:23.455 --> 20:25.787
if i was dead,
my fucking problems would go away.

20:28.193 --> 20:31.458
I started rhyming 'cause I was bored.
Plain and simple.

20:31.563 --> 20:36.000
But then my frustrations turned into rhymes,
and those rhymes told my story.

20:36.101 --> 20:39.901
¶ The 23 rd Psal m was what
my moms had to offer ¶

20:41.406 --> 20:46.537

21:01.193 --> 21:03.787
¶ Then I figured out nicks

21:03.895 --> 21:06.955
Christopher, it's a girl.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.431
¶ I know how it feels
to wake up fucked up ¶

21:09.534 --> 21:12.298
¶ Pockets broke as hell
Another rock to sell ¶

21:14.706 --> 21:18.437
¶ Baby on the way
Mad bills to pay ¶¶

21:25.684 --> 21:28.016

21:53.045 --> 21:55.707

22:14.333 --> 22:16.767
Hmm.

22:20.806 --> 22:24.071

She ain't that ugly.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.077

22:30.248 --> 22:32.876
Mmm.

22:32.984 --> 22:36.351
- Hey, what's going on?
- Chris?

22:37.756 --> 22:40.122
You be a great father.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.963
No doubt. No doubt, Ma.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.029
Yo, what's up?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.729
Hey. Look who's back, man.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.968

23:14.092 --> 23:17.152
Hey, yo, Big. I hope you remember
how to smoke one of these.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.753
It's what I do, man.
Keep this out your hand.

23:19.865 --> 23:22.390
That's for grown folks, man.

23:24.770 --> 23:28.069
- Give me that shit.
- Hey, yo. Now that you out, what you gonna do?

23:28.173 --> 23:31.939
Having a daughter
made me want to be a different kind of cat.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.341
Got a little shorty I gotta support,
you know what I'm saying?

23:34.446 --> 23:37.609
But not being able to
support her felt like a whole other kind of jail.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.412

- Hell, yeah.

What'd you say at the beginning

- Biggie Smalls.
- Biggie Smalls, huh?

24:26.832 --> 24:30.131

So you don't get it twisted,

My business is about the streets,
but my business ain't in the streets.

27:09.961 --> 27:13.522
And I can't be building nothing around no artist
that can get locked up any minute.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.499
I'm saying, if you got real paper coming my way,
I'm out the game.

27:16.601 --> 27:18.728
Don't chase the paper.
Chase the dream!

27:18.837 --> 27:23.035

and 10 pounds heavier from eating them niggas.

27:32.851 --> 27:35.820

dreams ain't paying the bills, G.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.319

27:37.422 --> 27:39.947

but if you throw me out to the jungle,
I'll have them motherfuckers dancing.

27:45.864 --> 27:51.097
Maybe in the right hands, I could be,
like, one of the greatest.

We can change the world, Biggie Smalls.

28:05.283 --> 28:09.083

They killing it. The East Coast just
waitin' for somebody to fill that void.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.256

28:15.360 --> 28:17.123
You can be the average
nigga from Brooklyn...

28:17.228 --> 28:19.128
or you can rap about
the average nigga from Brooklyn.

28:19.230 --> 28:22.131
You gotta let me know whether
it's the streets or the studio.

28:23.301 --> 28:25.235

You got a smart-ass mouth.

28:59.771 --> 29:01.705
You gonna do something about it?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.809
I ain't think so.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.745
Hold up.

29:16.287 --> 29:18.187
You wanna get something to eat?

29:22.494 --> 29:24.655

30:00.598 --> 30:03.465
Well, I was seeing someone.

30:04.769 --> 30:07.135
He kept thinkin'
we was in a Mike Tyson fight.

30:10.008 --> 30:13.910

30:56.054 --> 30:58.045

30:58.156 --> 31:02.149
Only thing I got lined up is some-
some college shows.

31:02.260 --> 31:06.128
It's gonna be a minute
before I get something real.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.028
Hey, Big.

31:08.132 --> 31:12.432
My father died hustling on these streets
when I was two years old.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.963
Ain't no future in this right here.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.236
Just because we got knocked down,
don't mean we can't get back up.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.413
What don't break a nigga make a nigga.

31:36.527 --> 31:40.361
I thought I hada record deal, and now
I can't even buy fuckin' diapers for T'yanna.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.797
Gotta punch the clock and shit.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.995
- I thought you told Puff you gonna stop hustling, man.
- I thought I was.

31:54.712 --> 31:56.270

31:56.381 --> 31:58.815
Yo, toss that! Toss that!

32:11.529 --> 32:15.590
We got another one.
He's heading to Saint Mark's.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.862
There's no where to go.

32:18.970 --> 32:22.633
Let's do this the easy way, huh?

32:22.740 --> 32:27.040
Show me your hands.
Come on, show me your hands.

32:27.145 --> 32:30.478
You show me your hands,
I'll put the piece away.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.352
You know, when I was a kid...

32:37.455 --> 32:40.015
you had a switchblade, brass knuckles,
you were a bad dude.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.524
Now you got 13-year-olds
looking to shoot the big niggers...

32:42.627 --> 32:44.561
on the corner so they could start
running shit themselves.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.857
I mean, what the fuck
is the world coming to...

32:46.965 --> 32:48.956
when a drug dealer can't
walk the streets at night?

32:50.068 --> 32:52.628
Tell me, Chris, what do you put on first?

32:52.737 --> 32:55.331
Your socks, your jacket, your piece?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.169

- Nah.

33:02.313 --> 33:06.682
Okay, one of you is goin' down

33:06.784 --> 33:09.514
Which ever one it is, I don't give a shit.
But there's no way...

33:09.620 --> 33:12.521

- No, by then it i'll be too late.

33:33.711 --> 33:38.011

- No, man. That's bullshit.

33:47.592 --> 33:50.459
Look, this music shit you got going on...

33:50.561 --> 33:52.791
It don't come around every fuckin' day.

33:52.897 --> 33:56.424
When a motherfucker like you make it,
we all make it.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.460
- What if I don't make it?
- Listen.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.540
I told you how to get into the drug game.

34:03.641 --> 34:06.337
Now I'm telling you
how to get the fuck out.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.969
You don't have a record deal?
Then go out and get one.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.980
But you're not going back on the block.

34:12.315 --> 34:14.306
Not when you got the skills
to do something...

34:14.418 --> 34:16.751

¶ Lil' Kim be the baddest bitch
in Brooklyn ¶¶

42:28.245 --> 42:32.113
Damn, shorty.
I'm loving that.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.706
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

42:33.817 --> 42:37.719
- What else you love?
- Mmm. I love it when you call me Big Poppa.

42:37.955 --> 42:40.583
- I don't understand what you're doing.
- I am being a man.

42:40.691 --> 42:42.818
You're coming in here
all hours of the night.

42:42.927 --> 42:45.157
- Jan's calling me.
- Me and Jan ain't even kicking it.

42:45.262 --> 42:48.356
You breaking up with your daughter too?
You too busy hanging out to go see her.

42:48.465 --> 42:50.365
I'm not hanging out.
I'm working.

42:50.467 --> 42:53.027
And I'm starting to question
what this job really is.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.037
Puff got it all lined up.

42:55.139 --> 42:59.098
What kind of man, grown-ass man,
calls himself "Puffy"?

42:59.209 --> 43:01.109
That's just absolutely ridiculous.

43:01.211 --> 43:03.543
- Puffy doesn't even have a job himself.
- It's not even like that.

43:03.647 --> 43:06.081
- It's not like what? It's not like what?
- Jesus.

43:06.183 --> 43:08.583
- What isn't it like, huh?
- Excuse me, Ms. Wallace.

43:08.686 --> 43:12.178
Ifl could just explain
why Chris has been late.

43:12.289 --> 43:14.484
Please. I want to hear this.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.584
Yes, ma'am. Uh-

43:17.695 --> 43:20.664
Your son has something special.

43:20.764 --> 43:25.599
And sometimes it's gonna mean late nights
and hard work, but I think it's gonna pay off.

43:28.706 --> 43:31.869
Now, the minute I see him slacking,
I'll be the first to let you know.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.605
I been talking to Mark
about becoming my manager.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.646
Good.

43:42.753 --> 43:47.520
And if you're asking me to hold you
equally responsible, Mark- believe me, I will.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.991
Yes, ma'am.

43:50.094 --> 43:54.292
- I need to have a word with Chris.
- Yes, ma'am.

44:10.014 --> 44:12.915
My doctor found a lump in my chest.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.385
What?

44:16.487 --> 44:21.151
My surgery is next week. They need to act
aggressively if I'm gonna have a chance.

44:21.258 --> 44:22.919
"If"?

44:23.027 --> 44:25.587
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I want to be up front with you, Christopher.

44:25.696 --> 44:28.062
- No, Ma. No, I don't want to hear all that.
- No, listen.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.999
- I need you to know something. Christopher! Please!
- I don't want to hear this, Ma.

44:40.444 --> 44:42.435
Listen, yo. I got these ideas in my head.

44:42.546 --> 44:46.482
Like, I've been thinking all night.
I can't get-Whoo!

44:46.583 --> 44:49.552
Look, look, yo. I've been thinkin'
about my cousin Wayne. He's smart.

44:49.653 --> 44:52.247
I been thinking about bringing him in
to help me with the management.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.586
I think you'll dig him, Big.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.662
Yo.

45:01.265 --> 45:06.032

- About what?
- I mean, whatever's buggin' you, Big.

45:09.073 --> 45:12.270
You haven't said shit

45:12.376 --> 45:15.709
My moms has breast cancer.
Talkin' gonna fix that?

45:19.950 --> 45:22.350
Shit.

45:22.453 --> 45:26.480
No. I guess not.

45:29.493 --> 45:32.394
I was only 15
when I lost my moms to cancer.

45:35.933 --> 45:38.060
How'd you deal with shit?

45:38.168 --> 45:40.102
I ain't feel like talking.

45:44.341 --> 45:48.072
Look, Big, I know you goin'
through hard times right now.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.515
But you're gonna have to be
a soldier for your moms.

45:53.751 --> 45:56.413
You gonna have to be there
and support her, man.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.511
I'm gonna pray for your moms, Big.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.166

55:38.735 --> 55:41.431
- Rolex diamond. You know what it is, nigga.
- Get some. Get some.

55:41.538 --> 55:43.972
We taking your money
and buying your bitches with your money.

55:44.074 --> 55:46.269
- That's right, nigga. You'll see.
- Come get some, motherfucker!

55:50.213 --> 55:53.444
I'm wearing this
to my first show coming up.

55:53.550 --> 55:55.609
What you think?

55:58.221 --> 56:00.712
That ain't bad.

56:02.325 --> 56:05.260
Ain't bad?
You must be going blind.

56:05.362 --> 56:07.728
I'm trying to make you
the Marilyn Monroe of hip-hop.

56:07.831 --> 56:09.731
That ain't turning no heads.

56:12.168 --> 56:14.728
- So I should lose the suspenders?
- Keep the suspenders.

56:15.805 --> 56:18.330
Lose the shirt.

56:34.057 --> 56:35.888
- Like this?
- Mmm.

56:37.305 --> 56:40.741
Like that. Yeah.

56:40.841 --> 56:42.741
- Faith, come on.

56:42.843 --> 56:44.834
Get it going. That's good.
Move, Faith. Yeah, good.

56:44.946 --> 56:47.414
Come on, y'all.
This ain't no funeral.

56:47.515 --> 56:51.918
It ain't even a photo.
It's a mission statement.

56:52.019 --> 56:55.318
Bad Boy ain't here to be in the game.
Bad Boy here to take over the game.

56:55.423 --> 56:57.288
Every body, take 10 minutes.

57:00.061 --> 57:03.827
Watching Faith, all I could think was, "Damn!"

57:03.931 --> 57:06.832
She was like some chick
fresh off a movie screen.

57:11.205 --> 57:13.105
My baby. Thank you.

57:13.207 --> 57:16.438
So, why a brother
gotta be left out in the cold?

57:16.544 --> 57:18.739
You done show everyone
up in here them pictures, except me.

57:21.482 --> 57:23.382
Look, uh, no offense.

57:23.484 --> 57:26.476
I think you're an incredible rapper
and I'm sure you're a nice guy...

57:26.587 --> 57:28.578
but I don't need all that right now.

57:28.689 --> 57:30.316
All what?

57:31.592 --> 57:33.958
What you saying?

57:34.061 --> 57:36.427
You don't need a brother
to make you smile?

57:36.530 --> 57:38.930
Sorry, but I'm not smiling.

57:39.033 --> 57:41.024
Not yet.

57:46.807 --> 57:50.299
All right, fine.
My daughter, Chyna.

57:51.412 --> 57:53.676
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.

57:53.781 --> 57:55.612
Just like her mother.

57:57.318 --> 57:59.616
What were you doing before
you hooked up with Puffy?

57:59.720 --> 58:03.281
- Pharmaceuticals. You know how it is.
- Typical.

58:05.426 --> 58:11.365
So, are you a bad guy trying to be good,
or a good guy trying to be bad?

58:11.465 --> 58:13.456
I'm someone trying to make it.

58:13.567 --> 58:17.264
- How'd you start singing?
- North Baptist Church choir.

58:17.371 --> 58:20.704
Typical.

58:20.808 --> 58:23.834
I wrote a couple joints
for other artists and finally I got my shot.

58:25.613 --> 58:29.014
I don't know what I'd be doing,
but I ain't think I'd be doing this.

58:29.116 --> 58:32.085
When I was a little girl,
everybody told me singing was my destiny...

58:32.186 --> 58:34.984
but I was secretly hoping to make a career
at doing the beat box.

58:35.089 --> 58:38.820
No! Get out of here. I know you ain't
trying to say you know how to beat box.

58:38.926 --> 58:41.224
- You trying to play me out?
- Let me hear some old-school flavor.

58:41.329 --> 58:43.160
- You gonna rhyme?
- I'm going to tear it down.

58:43.264 --> 58:45.858
- Shh.
- You shootin' jabs?

58:52.940 --> 58:55.374
¶ Some call me Biggie
or B.I.G. ¶

58:55.476 --> 58:58.411
¶ I'm just chilling
in the place to be ¶

58:58.512 --> 59:00.912
¶ And I ain't trying to preach
or teach some knowledge ¶

59:01.015 --> 59:04.507
¶ I'm just trying to call you
FEW- Faith Evans Wallace ¶¶

59:04.618 --> 59:08.782
I like your laugh. It's sexy.

59:10.024 --> 59:13.187
Why don't you let me do that?

59:13.294 --> 59:16.627
- Do what?
- Make you laugh.

59:16.731 --> 59:19.131
Can I be that man?

59:23.037 --> 59:28.270
¶ Oh, oh
Checkit out¶

59:32.513 --> 59:37.075
¶ To all the ladies in the place
with style and grace ¶

59:37.184 --> 59:38.947
¶ Allow me to lace

59:39.053 --> 59:41.749
Man, you're making all the big niggas
sexy again, brother. All right?

59:41.856 --> 59:45.883
Yo, Big. Thanks for representing for
the brothers hustling on the corners, man.

59:45.993 --> 59:49.759
Your story telling is the shit. For real.
I could picture everything you're rapping about.

59:49.864 --> 59:51.832
- Shit is like a fucking movie.
- For real, man.

59:51.932 --> 59:56.130
- Shit.
- What's up, Big? Can you sign right here for me?

59:56.237 --> 01:00:01.732
Right there.
I do all this for you, baby.

01:00:01.842 --> 01:00:06.404
- I love you, Big Poppa!
- I lovey'all, too.

01:00:06.514 --> 01:00:09.972
We had been
seeing each other for three weeks.

01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:12.177
But I ain't wanna wait another minute.

01:00:12.286 --> 01:00:14.880
In prosperity and adversity.

01:00:14.989 --> 01:00:17.583
Prosperity and adversity.

01:00:17.691 --> 01:00:21.491
And, for saking all others,
to always be faithful.

01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:29.999
You know me about a month, Big.
Don't say it if you're not ready.

01:00:33.374 --> 01:00:36.275
And, for saking all others,
to always be true.

01:00:37.845 --> 01:00:41.713
With the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:00:41.816 --> 01:00:44.512
You may kiss the bride.

01:00:53.561 --> 01:00:55.119
¶ You got it goin' on ¶

01:01:01.769 --> 01:01:03.669
Let's get it.

01:01:06.073 --> 01:01:07.335
Come on!

01:01:07.441 --> 01:01:09.500
¶ Uh, wha wha ¶

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.408
¶You got it goin' on

01:01:12.513 --> 01:01:15.243
- ¶ I used to be scared of the dick ¶
- Is she for real?

01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:18.318
¶ Now I throw lips to the shit
Handle it like a real bitch ¶

01:01:18.419 --> 01:01:21.217
¶ Heather Hunter, Janet Jacme
Take it in the butt ¶

01:01:21.322 --> 01:01:25.190
- ¶ Yeah, yeah, what, I got... ¶
- No! That's not the way I said do it.

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:27.590
Maybe I don't feel like doin' it
your wack-ass way.

01:01:27.695 --> 01:01:32.359
- Look, bitch, stop being so fucking difficult.
- Who you calling a bitch, nigga?

01:01:32.466 --> 01:01:36.095
You wasn't talking that shit when you was
eating my pussy the other night.

01:01:37.271 --> 01:01:39.000
Turn that shit off.

01:01:43.944 --> 01:01:46.037
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Are you out of yours?

01:01:46.146 --> 01:01:48.410
- Since when do you start treatin g me like a ho?
- She's my wife.

01:01:48.516 --> 01:01:50.814
And what the fuck am I?

01:01:50.918 --> 01:01:53.887
Someone whose ass I took out
of the fucking department stores.

01:01:53.988 --> 01:01:56.388
Ain't that what you wanted?

01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.617
You said, "I got you."

01:01:58.726 --> 01:02:01.286
- Shit.
- "No one's gonna hurt you no more."

01:02:01.395 --> 01:02:04.694
Look, this fucking recording studio
ain't big enough for all that personal shit.

01:02:04.798 --> 01:02:08.791
What do you see in her that you
don't see in me? I want to know.

01:02:08.903 --> 01:02:11.235
You're my fucking artist.
All right?

01:02:11.338 --> 01:02:13.431
You're my fucking artist.

01:02:15.476 --> 01:02:17.740
That's all I am to you, Big?

01:02:17.845 --> 01:02:19.813
Do the fucking song.

01:02:27.821 --> 01:02:30.984

Everybody put your middle fingers in the air

01:02:47.741 --> 01:02:49.834

01:02:49.944 --> 01:02:52.435

Know when he'll be back?

01:04:34.448 --> 01:04:37.576
I don't.
Is there a message?

01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:43.654
Um-

01:04:46.727 --> 01:04:49.787
Tell him he needs to visit his daughter

Well, tell them hos to beat it.

01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:53.689
You had a- a visitor, by the way.

01:05:53.794 --> 01:05:55.989
- Your ex came over.
- Jan?

01:05:56.096 --> 01:05:58.291
- Yeah.
- What the hell does she want?

01:05:58.398 --> 01:06:00.298
For you to spend time with your daughter.

- My bad.

01:06:12.479 --> 01:06:14.208
So check it.

01:06:14.314 --> 01:06:16.714
Mark met some chick, so I may let them...

01:06:16.817 --> 01:06:18.614
use my suite tonight,
so don't bother calling.

01:06:21.188 --> 01:06:23.315
You're letting Mark use your room?

01:06:23.423 --> 01:06:25.721
Yeah, it ain't no thing.

01:06:25.826 --> 01:06:28.454
It sounds stupid, that's all.

01:06:28.562 --> 01:06:31.497
That's 'cause it is stupid.
But it's for my man, you know?

01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:38.495
- All right. I love you.
- I love you, too, Fay.

I said, no, thank you

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:18.368

01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:24.768
- There he is.
- What's up, brother?

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:28.109
What's up? Looking good, baby.
How you doing? How's everything?

01:13:28.215 --> 01:13:29.876
- Everything good.
- Good to see you.

01:13:29.983 --> 01:13:32.611
- Here, you break.
- Oh, you want some of this?

01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:35.415
Yo, Pac, can I get your auto graph?

01:13:36.389 --> 01:13:38.721
- Here you go.
- Thankyou.

01:13:40.527 --> 01:13:42.222
This shit ever trip you out?

01:13:42.329 --> 01:13:47.164
- What?
- People wanting your autograph. They actin' like it's 14 karats.

01:13:47.267 --> 01:13:51.294
I had a kid come to me the other day,
tell me I was his hero.

01:13:51.404 --> 01:13:55.272
But, I'm like, nah.
Malcolm X should beyour hero. Dr. King.

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.842
That was Pac.

01:13:56.943 --> 01:14:01.175
A revolutionary one minute,
a thu g-life motherfucker the next.

01:14:01.281 --> 01:14:04.512
Ask 10 people who Pac is
and you get 10 different answers.

01:14:04.618 --> 01:14:06.916
But he was all that and more...

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:11.855
and sometimes he was just someone
who liked to fuck with you.

01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:15.291
- Give me your money. Take your little lunch money.
- Huh!

01:14:15.395 --> 01:14:20.833
But like Pac told me,
the best time would be when I was coming up.

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.664
Because once you on top,
you can only go down.

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.465
What's up, Dre?

01:14:25.572 --> 01:14:29.633
Pac was right.
That night at Quad Studios changed everything.

01:14:41.554 --> 01:14:44.022
Hey, yo! What's up, Pac?

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:47.487
- Hey! What up, Cease?
- You coming up?

01:14:47.594 --> 01:14:49.562
Yeah, I got a gig on the 12th floor.

01:14:49.663 --> 01:14:51.893
- All right. I'm gonna go tell Big.
- Yeah!

01:14:57.671 --> 01:15:00.139
Hey, yo, Big.
I just saw your boy Pac downstairs.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.140
Yeah?
Go get him.

01:15:02.242 --> 01:15:04.642
All right.

01:15:04.744 --> 01:15:07.941
- You know Big and them on the 10th floor. They in a session.
- Yeah? How their session going?

01:15:08.048 --> 01:15:10.812
- Come on, man. You know he doing his thing.
- Just make sure they're working.

01:15:12.152 --> 01:15:15.053
Yo, I hope Pac got some
of that good weed, man.

01:15:15.155 --> 01:15:18.386
They say, "Puff, puff, pass."
But if it's that good, I ain't passing nothing.

01:15:28.268 --> 01:15:30.702
Yo, get those motherfuckers
back in the elevator!

01:15:30.804 --> 01:15:34.069
Get the fuck back in the elevator, man!

01:15:34.174 --> 01:15:38.634
Yo, Big, man! Pac is downstairs getting rolled
on, man! They had the gun in my face!

01:15:38.745 --> 01:15:42.078
- Don't move. Stay here.
- They're still down there. Let me come with you, man!

01:15:47.387 --> 01:15:49.378
Fuck! Press 12.

01:15:57.697 --> 01:15:59.460
Motherfucker jacked me in the lobby, man!

01:15:59.566 --> 01:16:01.431
Pac!

01:16:05.071 --> 01:16:06.629
Stop right there!

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.470
- Hold on.
- Shut the fuck up and keep your hands in the air!

01:16:09.576 --> 01:16:12.602
Yo, somebody call the ambulance.
Yo, Pac. What happened, Pac?

01:16:12.712 --> 01:16:15.112
Tupac didn't know who the fuck to trust.

01:16:15.215 --> 01:16:17.547
Get away from me.

01:16:18.985 --> 01:16:22.785
Which one of y'all set me up?
I'm right here, motherfucker!

01:16:22.889 --> 01:16:24.914
What? Huh? Fuck!

01:16:25.024 --> 01:16:27.891
- As far as he was concerned-
- Oh, shit.

01:16:27.994 --> 01:16:29.791
Everyone near was responsible...

01:16:29.896 --> 01:16:31.921
Oh, shit. Fucky'all, man!

01:16:32.031 --> 01:16:34.499
Including me.

01:16:36.569 --> 01:16:39.970
In the aftermath
of the Tupac Shakur shooting at Quad Studios...

01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:43.304
the rapper-actor named record producer
Sean "Puffy" Combs...

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:46.436
What? No!
This is full of shit.

01:16:46.546 --> 01:16:50.778
Yo, Big, come on, man.
You don't need to be watching this right now.

01:16:50.884 --> 01:16:52.784
I warned him about those guys.

01:16:52.886 --> 01:16:56.322
Naming music producer Sean "Puffy" Combs
and the rapper Christopher Wallace...

01:16:56.423 --> 01:16:59.824
Now he's blaming me? How the fuck
could he say i do some shit like that?

01:16:59.926 --> 01:17:04.329
- Yeah, they're full of it, man.
- They wouldn't even let me see him in the hospital.

01:17:04.431 --> 01:17:06.661
Fuck it!
I'm gonna call him.

01:17:06.766 --> 01:17:09.496
- He know who shot him.
- Yo, Big, hold up.

01:17:09.602 --> 01:17:11.627
Yo, Big, hold up.
Big!

01:17:11.738 --> 01:17:14.969
Yo, Big, ho- Big, hold up.
Hey, Big, hold up, man.

01:17:15.074 --> 01:17:18.737
They just found your man
guilty on that sex abuse.

01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:22.337
He ain't thinking clearly right now.
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:22.449 --> 01:17:26.510
Just give him some time.
Just give him some time, let this cool down.

01:17:26.619 --> 01:17:28.587
Shit doesn't make any sense.

01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:31.088
At the Superior Court
where he faced ajury...

01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:34.092
in the sex-abuse trial
brought against him last year.

01:17:34.194 --> 01:17:37.425
He was acquitted of six counts in the indictment
and found guilty of three others.

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:40.021
He now faces sentencing
and probable jail time.

01:17:40.266 --> 01:17:44.134
Hey, yo, check this out. Let
me tell y'all who the winneris.

01:17:44.237 --> 01:17:46.865
And the winner is

01:17:46.973 --> 01:17:50.204
Above the backboards and the rims.
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:53.211
Pac went to jail on the sex-abuse charge.

01:17:53.313 --> 01:17:56.214
We thought all the bullshit
would die down...

01:17:56.316 --> 01:18:00.343
but Suge Knight, the owner of Death Row Records,
had something else in mind.

01:18:00.453 --> 01:18:03.354
I'd like to tell Tupac to keep his guards up.

01:18:03.456 --> 01:18:06.823
We riding with him.
And one other thing I'd like to say.

01:18:06.926 --> 01:18:12.592
Any artists out there that want to be artists
and want to stay a star...

01:18:12.699 --> 01:18:16.897
and don't- don't have to worry
about the executive producer...

01:18:17.003 --> 01:18:23.033
All up in the videos, all on the records, dancin'...

01:18:24.477 --> 01:18:26.274
come to Death Row!

01:18:29.315 --> 01:18:32.580
- Hell, yeah! West Side, boys!
- Yo, come on, man.

01:18:33.853 --> 01:18:37.118
Yo, we gotta rise above this.

01:18:37.223 --> 01:18:41.023
Big, what is the East Coast-West Coast rivalry?

01:18:41.127 --> 01:18:44.563
Are you afraid for your life?

01:18:44.664 --> 01:18:48.532
- Any further comments on Death Row?
- Biggie, what did Puff Daddy do?

01:18:48.635 --> 01:18:50.535
Did you shoot Tupac?

01:18:53.573 --> 01:18:55.871
What are you going to do now
that Pac's getting out of jail?

01:18:55.975 --> 01:18:58.637
Go, go!
Get us the fuck out of here!

01:18:58.745 --> 01:19:00.645
Pac and his people have been saying...

01:19:00.747 --> 01:19:02.647
that "Who Shot Ya?"
The joint Biggie came out with...

01:19:02.749 --> 01:19:05.980
is trying to dis Pac a bout
the shooting at Quad Studios.

01:19:06.085 --> 01:19:08.713
But Biggie's camp is saying he wrote that song
before the shooting ever happened.

01:19:08.821 --> 01:19:10.721
And he stopped playing that song now.

01:19:10.823 --> 01:19:13.189
Yeah, he stopped playing the song.
And now Pac is coming out...

01:19:13.293 --> 01:19:15.659
with this new song getting at Biggie.
The whole thing is getting out of control.

01:19:15.762 --> 01:19:18.890
The fans are choosing sides,
the labels are choosing sides.

01:19:18.998 --> 01:19:21.330
What's up?

01:19:21.434 --> 01:19:25.165
What? You're just gonna
sit there looking stupid?

01:19:25.271 --> 01:19:27.671
- Yo, your boy's been wilding out, man.
- Who?

01:19:27.774 --> 01:19:32.768
Pac. He's been on a mission
ever since Suge bailed him out of jail.

01:19:36.783 --> 01:19:40.651
¶ First off, fuck your bitch
and the clique you claim ¶

01:19:40.753 --> 01:19:42.948
¶ West Side when we ride
come equipped with game ¶

01:19:43.056 --> 01:19:45.320
¶ You claim to be a playa
but I fucked your wife ¶

01:19:45.425 --> 01:19:47.916
¶ We bust on Bad Boy's niggas
Fuck for life ¶

01:19:48.027 --> 01:19:49.585
¶ Plus, Puffy tryin'
to see me weak ¶

01:19:49.696 --> 01:19:53.689
That's some dumb shit. I ain't sweating it.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.734
¶ We keep on coming
while we running for your jewels ¶

01:19:55.835 --> 01:19:58.497
¶ Steady gunning Keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules ¶

01:19:58.605 --> 01:20:00.402
¶ Little Caesar
go ask your homey how I'll leave you ¶

01:20:00.506 --> 01:20:02.838
¶ Cut your young ass up leave you in pieces
Now be deceased ¶

01:20:02.942 --> 01:20:05.467
¶ Lil' Kim, don't fuck around
with real G's ¶

01:20:05.578 --> 01:20:08.479
- ¶ Quick to snatch you gly ass off the street ¶
- Where you get this from?

01:20:08.581 --> 01:20:10.776
Got it from the store, man.
It's all over the place.

01:20:10.883 --> 01:20:14.683
¶ So let the West Side ride tonight ¶¶

01:20:16.789 --> 01:20:19.690
Been singing since I was
in the choir as a little girl.

01:20:19.792 --> 01:20:22.352
Go see what that is.

01:20:22.462 --> 01:20:25.727
- Um, I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on.
- Where the fuck is Faith?

01:20:25.832 --> 01:20:28.164
- Big, I'm doing an interview.
- When were you going to tell me?

01:20:28.267 --> 01:20:31.134
I gotta find out about it like this?
You fucked that motherfucker? Huh?

01:20:31.237 --> 01:20:33.137
Come the fuck here.

01:20:33.239 --> 01:20:36.333
Get the fuck over here.
Let me talk to you.

01:20:36.442 --> 01:20:38.933
You fucked that motherfucker? Huh?

01:20:39.045 --> 01:20:41.445
You want to fuck with niggas?
You want to fuck with niggas?

01:20:41.547 --> 01:20:43.447
- Huh?
- Get out of here!

01:20:43.549 --> 01:20:46.746
Yo, Big, go downstairs, man.
You know somebody called security by now!

01:20:46.853 --> 01:20:49.083
Big, get the hell out!

01:20:49.188 --> 01:20:51.088
Get the hell out, man!

01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:53.624
- What were you thinkin'?
- I wasn't fuckin' thinking.

01:20:53.726 --> 01:20:57.389
I just fucking snapped, all right?
I just wanted to get the truth.

01:20:57.497 --> 01:21:01.058
Yo, man, truth is your Pac, he trying to
bring you down to the gutter with him...

01:21:01.167 --> 01:21:03.067
and you playing right into his hands, Big.

01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:05.433
I mean, well, we can squabble...

01:21:05.538 --> 01:21:09.634
but, yo, I just got finished
signing with Clive for $42 million.

01:21:09.742 --> 01:21:13.701
And you getting $5 million, Big.
Don't mess that up.

01:21:28.728 --> 01:21:33.756
Fay-Fay? Come on, FEW, open the door.
I want to talk to you.

01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:37.028
Come on, open the door.
Please.

01:21:37.136 --> 01:21:39.104
Fay.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.100
Can you open the door?

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:46.178
Fay!

01:21:54.921 --> 01:21:56.821
What's going on?

01:21:56.923 --> 01:21:59.949
Fuck you!

01:22:00.059 --> 01:22:03.426
I don't even know
who the fuck you are anymore.

01:22:03.529 --> 01:22:05.827
Can you listen for a minute?

01:22:05.932 --> 01:22:09.493
- Fay, just listen to me for a minute.
- It's over.

01:22:09.602 --> 01:22:13.800
I'm sorry about bugging the fuck out.
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

01:22:13.906 --> 01:22:16.636
Why couldn't you just be a man and ask me?

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:22.071
Okay, I'm asking.
What happened with you and Pac?

01:22:24.283 --> 01:22:26.581
I saw him at the House of Blues.

01:22:26.686 --> 01:22:29.780
We took that picture,
and that's all it was supposed to be.

01:22:29.889 --> 01:22:32.153
And that's all there was.

01:22:32.258 --> 01:22:33.987
End of story.

01:22:35.695 --> 01:22:39.597
- Okay.
- May be now you have an idea what it feels like to be cheated on.

01:22:39.699 --> 01:22:44.602
I'm not bragging, Fay, but I could have had
10 bitches a day if i wanted.

01:22:44.704 --> 01:22:48.367
So go have 10, 20.
I don't give a fuck.

01:22:49.909 --> 01:22:52.503
I ain't mean that.

01:23:00.119 --> 01:23:03.953
No, Chris.

01:23:06.092 --> 01:23:08.322
I'm not laughing.

01:23:09.562 --> 01:23:11.189
- Not anymore.
- Come on, Fay.

01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:31.006
Damn!

01:23:32.819 --> 01:23:34.719
- What?
- This Notorious?

01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:37.722
- Yeah.
- You gonna be wearing a toe tag, nigga.

01:23:37.824 --> 01:23:40.418
- Who this?
- West Coast, motherfucker.

01:23:42.628 --> 01:23:46.257
- What size are these?
- Those are 14s like you asked.

01:23:46.365 --> 01:23:48.333
These ain't no fucking 14s.

01:23:48.434 --> 01:23:51.232
Fucking 12s.
These ain't no fucking 14s.

01:23:51.337 --> 01:23:53.737
- All right, every bod yout.
- Cease, go get the car!

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.899
- Everybody out!
- All these fucking problems.

01:23:56.008 --> 01:23:58.704
- Out, people. Come on. Come on.
- Hey, Mark, y'all playing around.

01:23:58.811 --> 01:24:01.211
- You ain't doing your job!
- Y'all sent over the wrong size shoes!

01:24:01.314 --> 01:24:04.215
Y'all sent the wrong size shoes!
Now he ain't going on!

01:24:04.317 --> 01:24:06.512
I ain't got time for no tempertantrum!

01:24:06.619 --> 01:24:09.417
Look, you need to chill, Puff.
He's got a lot on his mind right now.

01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:12.685
What? He stressed out about them
Death Row niggas in the audience?

01:24:12.792 --> 01:24:16.125
Big ain't worried about it.
It ain't that, man. Fay's pregnant.

01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:19.130
How'd that knuckle head get her pregnant?
I thought they was broke up.

01:24:19.232 --> 01:24:21.632
All this soap opera drama.
Yo, Big!

01:24:21.734 --> 01:24:24.567
- I'm not going on.
- Big, come on, man. Don't do this to me.

01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:27.104
- Don't do this to your self!
- I've done just about...

01:24:27.206 --> 01:24:29.265
every fucking thing
you have ever asked of me.

01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:32.742
All I want in return is some
motherfucking shoes that fit.

01:24:32.845 --> 01:24:35.143
Yo, man, yo, man.

01:24:38.618 --> 01:24:41.086
- There you go dancing again.
- Yeah.

01:24:45.091 --> 01:24:46.820
Maybe I take my shoes too seriously.

01:24:46.926 --> 01:24:48.917
Size 14, I would take them seriously.

01:24:57.737 --> 01:25:00.228
I know lately that it ain't been easy.

01:25:00.339 --> 01:25:02.239
Pac is talking about us.

01:25:02.341 --> 01:25:04.241
The media is doing whatever they can...

01:25:04.343 --> 01:25:06.470
to keep this
East Coast-West Coast thing going on.

01:25:06.579 --> 01:25:09.571
I wanna be the last cat still standing.

01:25:09.682 --> 01:25:12.651
I'm hoping that you want the same thing.

01:25:17.123 --> 01:25:20.422
Yo, look, i just got these
from Big Sexy.

01:25:20.526 --> 01:25:23.495
They ain't fly or nothin',
but they gonna have to work, baby.

01:25:23.596 --> 01:25:27.589
I used to sling rock for nice kicks.
Now look at me.

01:25:28.868 --> 01:25:31.860
This your idea of us changing the world?

01:25:31.971 --> 01:25:35.429
We can't change the world
unless we change our selves.

01:25:43.449 --> 01:25:47.545
Yo, Big. What now, huh, motherfucker?
Huh? West Side, motherfucker!

01:25:47.653 --> 01:25:51.555
Now you on the best side! What you gonna
do now, bitch? Huh? Huh, motherfucker?

01:25:51.657 --> 01:25:54.319
- Let me talk to you, man.
- Your bitch ass set me up!

01:25:54.427 --> 01:25:57.863
What you gotta say now, motherfucker?
That's why i fucked your wife!

01:25:57.964 --> 01:26:00.694
Oh! He got the strap!
He got the strap!

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.234
- You set me up, motherfucker!
- He got the strap.

01:26:03.336 --> 01:26:05.133
Let's go!

01:26:05.237 --> 01:26:07.296
What the fuck? Come on, man!
West Side, bitch!

01:26:07.406 --> 01:26:08.998
Catch you on the rebound, big boy.

01:26:09.108 --> 01:26:12.168
Me and Pac should have said, "Fuck that bullshit.

01:26:12.278 --> 01:26:14.508
Let's go somewhere
and talk this shit out."

01:26:14.613 --> 01:26:17.707
But the fact is,
we were both way be yond that now.

01:26:20.786 --> 01:26:22.686
The media went crazy.

01:26:22.788 --> 01:26:24.688
It had nothing to do with hip-hop...

01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:27.554
but everything to do with
selling papers and magazines.

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.059
If it ain't New York, it ain't shit.

01:26:29.161 --> 01:26:30.526
West Side, Compton in the house!

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:33.393
- We got Biggie. We got everybody.
- We got Pac. We got Dre.

01:26:33.499 --> 01:26:34.898
Play our shit on the East Coast.

01:26:35.001 --> 01:26:36.901
None of that shit get played
in the clubs in the Bronx.

01:26:37.003 --> 01:26:39.267
We created all this
rap shit anyway. East Coast.

01:26:39.372 --> 01:26:43.604
West Side! They might think they started
the game, but we elevated that motherfucker.

01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:45.939
Tupac knows what he's talking about.
He talks about the hood.

01:26:46.045 --> 01:26:48.411
He talks about what's actually
going on on the streets.

01:26:48.514 --> 01:26:52.883
I know Big set him up. That's why my man Pac
came back with "Hit 'Em Up."

01:26:52.985 --> 01:26:54.953
That's some bullshit.
Set him up?

01:26:55.054 --> 01:26:57.420
Biggie wrote "Who Shot Ya??"
Because he got something to do with Pac.

01:26:57.523 --> 01:27:00.185
Big wrote "Who Shot Ya??" months
before that shit went down with Pac.

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:04.729
How is Pac gonna really think
that Biggie would set him up like that?

01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.889
Fuck West Coast.
Man, they can eat a motherfucking dick.

01:27:06.999 --> 01:27:08.626
I don't give a fuck
if you think it's gangsta.

01:27:08.734 --> 01:27:10.634
- Fuck Compton, man.
- Fuck the East Coast.
- Fuck the West Coast.

01:27:10.736 --> 01:27:14.433
That's what the fuck I think about
the motherfucking East motherfucking Coast.

01:27:23.983 --> 01:27:27.043
- ¶ Just give me the loot, give me the loot ¶
- ¶ Money, money, money¶

01:27:27.153 --> 01:27:28.745
¶ Give me the loot
give me the loot ¶

01:27:28.854 --> 01:27:30.617
¶ Give me the loot

01:27:30.723 --> 01:27:33.658
- ¶ Money, money, money ¶
- ¶ Give me the loot, give me the loot ¶

01:27:33.759 --> 01:27:35.659
¶ I'm a bad, bad man ¶

01:27:35.761 --> 01:27:38.252
¶ My man Infleft a Tec

01:27:38.364 --> 01:27:39.888
¶Turned him self in

01:27:39.999 --> 01:27:41.830
¶A one-to-three
He be home the end of'93 ¶

01:27:41.934 --> 01:27:44.835
¶ I'm trying to get this paper, G
You with me ¶

01:27:44.937 --> 01:27:47.599
¶ Motherfucking right
My pocket's looking kind oftight ¶

01:27:47.706 --> 01:27:50.072
¶ And l'm stressed
Yo, Biggie, let me get the vest ¶

01:27:50.176 --> 01:27:52.269
¶ No need for that
Just grab the fucking gat ¶

01:27:52.378 --> 01:27:55.279
¶ The first pocket that's fat
let's take it to his back¶

01:27:55.381 --> 01:27:57.246
¶ Word is bond Yo, no fronting

01:27:57.349 --> 01:28:00.250
¶ Treat it like boxing
Stick and move, stick and move ¶

01:28:00.352 --> 01:28:02.013
¶ Nigga, you ain't got
to explain shit ¶

01:28:02.121 --> 01:28:04.919
¶ I've been robbing motherfuckers
since the slave ships ¶

01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:08.755
¶ With the same clip
and the same 4-5-¶

01:28:14.467 --> 01:28:15.934
Yo, enough. Cut that.

01:28:20.973 --> 01:28:23.305
Shut that shit down!

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:27.172
- Yo, put that joint on.
- Big, what you doing?

01:28:27.279 --> 01:28:29.873
Sometimes you gotta rise above it.
Sometimes you gotta step on in.

01:28:29.982 --> 01:28:32.473
- Don't sing that song, man.
- I got to.

01:28:32.585 --> 01:28:37.022
Yo, check it out. This industry will turn
your best friends into your worst enemies.

01:28:37.123 --> 01:28:39.489
Pac warned me, but I didn't believe him.

01:28:39.592 --> 01:28:41.685
This song was made months a go.

01:28:41.794 --> 01:28:45.560
He probably won't believe me.
Maybe nobody will.

01:28:45.664 --> 01:28:48.565
But frankly, I don't give a fuck.

01:28:48.667 --> 01:28:51.067
Drop that joint, DJ Enuff.

01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:53.570
¶ Who shot ya ¶

01:28:53.672 --> 01:28:55.537
¶ Separate the weak

01:28:55.641 --> 01:28:57.632
¶ Hard to creep

01:28:57.743 --> 01:29:00.041
¶ It's on, nigga
Fuck all that bickering beef ¶

01:29:00.146 --> 01:29:03.047
¶ I can hear sweat
trickling down your cheek ¶

01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:06.050
¶ Your heart beat sounds
like Sasquatch feet ¶

01:29:06.152 --> 01:29:08.211
¶ Thundering
shaking the concrete ¶

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.811
¶ Finish this stuff

01:29:10.923 --> 01:29:13.585

01:29:24.436 --> 01:29:26.734
¶ Burn slow like blunts

01:29:26.839 --> 01:29:29.034
¶ Peel more skins

Head line news at the top of the hour.

01:30:13.752 --> 01:30:17.153
Right now we've got some breaking news
for you out of Las Vegas.

01:30:17.256 --> 01:30:20.748
An apparent drive- by shooting
targeting rapper-actor Tupac Shakur.

01:30:20.859 --> 01:30:23.828
- Hey, yo, Big, come in here, man!
- At the time of the shooting-

01:30:23.929 --> 01:30:25.863
What the hell you hollering about?

01:30:25.965 --> 01:30:29.128
Shakur was accompanied
by his producer, Suge Knight.

01:30:29.235 --> 01:30:31.703
Police are not yet
indicating any suspects.

01:30:31.804 --> 01:30:35.638
However, eye witnesses reported
hearing multiple gunshots.

01:30:35.741 --> 01:30:40.235
Shakur was air lifted to the Las Ve gas University
Medical Center with four gunshot wounds...

01:30:40.346 --> 01:30:42.610
and is reported to be
in critical condition.

01:30:42.715 --> 01:30:44.740
What the fuck?

01:31:17.416 --> 01:31:22.945
I pray all this East Coast-West Coast
mess is over now.

01:31:23.055 --> 01:31:26.081
I saw his mother on TV.

01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:28.182
She's a strong woman.

01:31:29.895 --> 01:31:32.864
But no parent
should have to bury their child.

01:31:32.965 --> 01:31:36.492
I just always figured we had time
to straighten things out.

01:31:36.602 --> 01:31:39.537
You don't think this had
anything to do with your argument?

01:31:39.638 --> 01:31:41.936
No.

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:44.009
I don't.

01:31:45.377 --> 01:31:49.541
Well, nobody is invincible, Son.

01:31:49.648 --> 01:31:52.481
That's why we have to make
everything we do now count.

01:31:54.653 --> 01:31:58.180
I'm chilling with my man Pac, who schooled me
to the game and shit. Know what I'm sayin'?

01:31:58.290 --> 01:32:02.989
Now we a bout to wreak havoc on you
motherfuckers, man. Know what I'm sayin'?

01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:10.768
I don't know when the hell
they'll fix your truck...

01:32:10.869 --> 01:32:13.429
but I 'll get us home before
we're seen in this piece of shit.

01:32:13.539 --> 01:32:16.906
I don't care, Cease.
Just drive.

01:32:20.145 --> 01:32:21.840
Watch out!

01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:27.477
In that one moment, I had that thought a gain.

01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:31.022
Dying would be better
than dealing with this shit.

01:32:31.256 --> 01:32:34.225
I was leaving,
and I was sitting in a hotel, and a voice said...

01:32:34.326 --> 01:32:36.521
"Do you see any niggers?"

01:32:36.628 --> 01:32:40.086
And I said, " No." And it said, "You know why?
'Cause there aren't any."

01:32:40.199 --> 01:32:43.225
- Yeah, I been here three weeks,
I haven't even said it.

01:32:43.335 --> 01:32:45.929
I ain't gonna never call
another black man nigger.

01:32:46.038 --> 01:32:50.031
Look at you. Your mama
should have never let you out the house.

01:32:50.142 --> 01:32:52.406
Oh, shit.

01:32:52.511 --> 01:32:54.877
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, bro, what's going on?

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.971
- When did you get out?
- Yesterday.

01:32:57.082 --> 01:33:00.074
- You picked up some weight.
- Man, look who's talking.

01:33:00.185 --> 01:33:02.312
Damn.

01:33:02.421 --> 01:33:04.355
Wow.

01:33:04.456 --> 01:33:07.789
Biggie motherfuckin' Smalls.
I'm proud of you, dog.

01:33:07.893 --> 01:33:11.989
When the brothers in the pen found out
you was my boy, I got mad love.

01:33:12.097 --> 01:33:14.327
Yeah?
How much love did you get?

01:33:14.433 --> 01:33:16.196
Man, fuck you, bitch.

01:33:16.301 --> 01:33:20.738
D Roc, there's not a day that don't go by
when I don't think about what you did for me.

01:33:20.839 --> 01:33:22.932
I set some paper aside for you.

01:33:26.578 --> 01:33:28.478
I didn't do it for no payoff.

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:33.176
If shit was reversed, I don't know
how I could do that bid for you like that.

01:33:33.285 --> 01:33:38.416
Well, if shit was reversed, I don't know
if I could have been strong enough to make it.

01:33:38.524 --> 01:33:41.357
Making it?

01:33:42.528 --> 01:33:44.996
It ain't all it's cracked up to be.

01:33:45.097 --> 01:33:46.997
More money, more problems.

01:33:47.099 --> 01:33:49.363
- Beats the corner.
- Guess so.

01:33:49.468 --> 01:33:52.028
Hell, yeah.

01:33:52.137 --> 01:33:54.002
So how's Tee-Tee doing, huh?

01:33:56.275 --> 01:33:58.436
Okay. I guess.

01:34:05.517 --> 01:34:08.782
I'm gonna check you out
a little later on, all right?

01:34:10.656 --> 01:34:16.219
You know, neither one of us had our fathers
around to teach us how to be men.

01:34:16.328 --> 01:34:19.297
We were just learning
as we was going along.

01:34:22.434 --> 01:34:26.302
But maybe making it
ain't just about the shit you do on stage.

01:34:26.405 --> 01:34:28.635
You a philosopher now?

01:34:30.809 --> 01:34:34.745
Man, I think everyone
that's in the pen is a philosopher.

01:34:34.847 --> 01:34:39.341
But when you're on your back,
laying on that cot...

01:34:39.451 --> 01:34:42.648
you spend a lot of time
staring at the ceiling...

01:34:42.754 --> 01:34:44.722
Iooking for God...

01:34:46.124 --> 01:34:48.684
thinking about what's important.

01:34:49.795 --> 01:34:51.660
Keep making it, Chris.

01:35:11.049 --> 01:35:13.745
You gotta let me know
whether it's the streets or the studio.

01:35:17.322 --> 01:35:20.382
You think that makes you a man?

01:35:20.492 --> 01:35:23.222
You be a great father.

01:35:23.328 --> 01:35:25.592
What if I don't make it?

01:35:25.697 --> 01:35:28.962
I love you too.

01:35:29.067 --> 01:35:32.434
We gonna be all right, just you and me.

01:35:32.538 --> 01:35:34.267
You're too fat, black, and ugly.

01:35:34.373 --> 01:35:37.968
I don't even know who the
fuck you are anymore.

01:35:38.076 --> 01:35:41.375
Are you a bad guy trying to be good,
or a good guy trying to be bad?

01:36:01.867 --> 01:36:04.995
And I want you to know...

01:36:05.103 --> 01:36:06.832
¶ That these are the breaks ¶

01:36:06.939 --> 01:36:09.499
¶ That these are the breaks ¶

01:36:09.608 --> 01:36:12.008
¶ Break it up, break it up
break it up ¶

01:36:14.513 --> 01:36:16.879
Now go play. That's my girl.

01:36:23.956 --> 01:36:26.948
- Hello?
- Hey. What you doing?

01:36:27.059 --> 01:36:29.926
- I'm just kicking it with my daughter.
- How's the leg?

01:36:30.028 --> 01:36:31.859
It's all right.

01:36:31.964 --> 01:36:34.489
I got one more stop, and then I'm on my way.
You need anything?

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.158
That's not a good idea.

01:36:38.103 --> 01:36:41.129
- What isn't?
- I'm just here kicking it with my daughter.

01:36:41.239 --> 01:36:45.005
- You were the one who told me to come over.
- I'll call you later.

01:36:47.145 --> 01:36:50.205
I'm done with this.
I'm sick of you treating me like shit.

01:36:50.315 --> 01:36:54.115
You know what, nigga?
Don't even bother calling. All right? Fuckyou.

01:36:54.219 --> 01:36:55.880
Fuckyou too, bitch.

01:37:03.428 --> 01:37:05.396
Come here, Tee-Tee.

01:37:12.471 --> 01:37:15.634
I'm gonna teach you something
I never want you to forget.

01:37:15.741 --> 01:37:17.641
Another rap?

01:37:17.743 --> 01:37:21.941
No. More important than any rap song.

01:37:22.047 --> 01:37:24.447
Look at me.

01:37:24.549 --> 01:37:26.881
See, you're my princess.

01:37:26.985 --> 01:37:31.251
So no matter what, for any reason...

01:37:31.356 --> 01:37:33.984
never let a man call you a bitch.

01:37:34.092 --> 01:37:36.583
- You got it?
- Yes, Daddy.

01:37:36.695 --> 01:37:38.993
- You sure you got it? You better have it, you hear?
- Yes.

01:37:50.308 --> 01:37:53.505
Hey, yo, isn't that Sandy?

01:37:53.612 --> 01:37:56.581
Yo, she used to be a crack head.

01:38:14.633 --> 01:38:17.625
People dying for that next
Biggie Smalls joint.

01:38:17.736 --> 01:38:21.263
Tell me the reason why you're here
'cause you ready to get back in the studio.

01:38:21.373 --> 01:38:23.773
I can't talk about the same shit anymore.

01:38:23.875 --> 01:38:26.969
A motherfucker's a work in progress.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:38:27.079 --> 01:38:30.537
But I ain't hustling
on the streets no more.

01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:35.109
I got two kids. Half the time
I don't even feel like the same cat.

01:38:36.755 --> 01:38:38.655
I wanna do something different.

01:38:38.757 --> 01:38:42.284
So if it's cool to try some new shit...

01:38:42.394 --> 01:38:44.089
I'm ready to come back.

01:38:51.203 --> 01:38:53.364
Yeah.

01:38:53.472 --> 01:38:55.667
What?
The Notorious baby-What?

01:38:55.774 --> 01:38:57.935
- Uh-huh. You ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:38:58.043 --> 01:39:01.410
- Ready to run the world? Ready to take it?
- Ain't trippin'.

01:39:01.513 --> 01:39:04.038
I don't see nobody.
What's up? I'm walking around...

01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:06.049
- don't see nobody.
- You know how we do it.

01:39:06.151 --> 01:39:09.211
All right.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:39:09.321 --> 01:39:11.516
- Yo, welcome back, Biggie.
- Let's get it.

01:40:07.312 --> 01:40:09.303
I did it.

- Going to L.A.X.
- Cali?

01:40:30.769 --> 01:40:34.330
- No doubt, baby. California.
- Yeah.

01:40:34.439 --> 01:40:36.873
I don't like you going out there.

01:40:36.975 --> 01:40:40.240
I think me being in L.A.
Is gonna finally put an end to all of this.

01:40:40.345 --> 01:40:43.940
Besides, I'm just promoting the album.
I'll be home soon.

01:40:44.049 --> 01:40:46.517
Mmm.

01:40:47.552 --> 01:40:50.282
Hey, Ma. I'm proud of you.

01:40:51.957 --> 01:40:55.449
Proud of me? For what?

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:59.519
Fighting cancer, then getting your master's,
sticking with it...

01:40:59.631 --> 01:41:01.622
even with everything you've been through.

01:41:06.638 --> 01:41:08.606
Thankyou.

01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:16.012
I want you to be careful, Chrissy-poo.

01:41:16.114 --> 01:41:18.878
I hate it when you call me that.

01:41:18.984 --> 01:41:23.387
I forgot.
You're all grown-up now.

01:41:24.823 --> 01:41:29.556
West Coast rappers
were still scared to come to the East Coast...

01:41:29.661 --> 01:41:32.095
and East Coast rappers
were scared to come out west...

01:41:32.197 --> 01:41:35.325
but it was time
to put an end to all this shit.

01:41:35.433 --> 01:41:37.833
So I went to Cali to promote my album.

01:41:37.936 --> 01:41:41.099
Y'al I see how sexy I looked last night
at the Soul Train Awards?

01:41:41.206 --> 01:41:45.006
- Yeah. We saw you.
- I gotta stay out here and promote the album.

01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:47.135
You think T'yanna could come out?

01:41:48.513 --> 01:41:51.141
Maybe my moms could bring her?

01:41:52.651 --> 01:41:54.619
Um-

01:41:56.421 --> 01:41:58.946
Okay.

01:41:59.057 --> 01:42:01.582
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

01:42:03.628 --> 01:42:05.562
Thanks, man.
These shits are hot!

01:42:05.664 --> 01:42:07.791
I'm gonna holler at you later, all right?

01:42:07.899 --> 01:42:10.697

Vibe magazine is hosting a major party

01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:24.709
and some big names are expected to attend.

01:43:24.809 --> 01:43:27.437
Hello?

01:43:27.545 --> 01:43:30.912
- You coming to the party?
- Yeah, we on our way over there right now.

01:43:31.016 --> 01:43:33.280
- I thought you were going to London.
- I was...

01:43:33.385 --> 01:43:35.478
but I gotta stay here
and promote the album.

01:43:35.587 --> 01:43:38.954
So when you get back to New York,
I want you to send C.J. Out here with my moms.

01:43:39.057 --> 01:43:42.788
Jan's letting me scoop up T'yanna,
so I need my son to be here.

01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:47.858
All right, we can work that out.

01:43:47.966 --> 01:43:49.934

01:44:07.886 --> 01:44:09.478

¶ Biggie there every night

01:44:22.434 --> 01:44:23.731

Sound like you just did,
and we ain't even done yet.

01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:06.668
Let's change the world, Big.

01:45:08.046 --> 01:45:10.981
Can't change the world
unless we change our selves.

01:45:13.218 --> 01:45:17.780
I think all my life I was trying to become a man...

01:45:17.889 --> 01:45:23.486
but for some reason on this night
I didn't have to try any more.

01:45:27.465 --> 01:45:31.697
My second album was about to drop...

01:45:31.803 --> 01:45:36.831
and it felt like God was giving me
a clean slate all over again.

01:45:36.941 --> 01:45:42.072
Unfortunately, we being shut down.
We done burn it up in here tonight.

01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:44.876
Fire marshal's in the house
and we got to go.

01:45:44.983 --> 01:45:47.645
Please exit to the far left.

01:45:47.752 --> 01:45:50.687
We should just chill.
Let them clear out first, all right?

01:46:04.536 --> 01:46:06.766
You're the man.
Everybody love you right now, son.

01:46:06.871 --> 01:46:09.931
Yo, look. We got shit to do

01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:12.509
- Hotel, baby. All right?

01:46:20.218 --> 01:46:22.914
What's up?

01:46:23.021 --> 01:46:25.455
I just wanted to say sorry and shit.

01:46:25.557 --> 01:46:27.991
When I get back to New York,

01:46:28.092 --> 01:46:30.356
sit down and figure out
what the fuck we doing?

01:46:30.461 --> 01:46:32.691
No more drama.

01:46:32.797 --> 01:46:34.765
We could do that.

01:46:36.801 --> 01:46:38.701
You all right?

01:46:38.803 --> 01:46:41.033

01:46:53.918 --> 01:46:57.410

01:46:57.522 --> 01:47:00.753

¶ They are sound a sleep ¶¶

01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:50.993
Ms. Wallace, if there's anything...
anything that you need, I...

01:49:57.001 --> 01:50:01.097
I wanna take my son home
just one last time.

01:51:07.472 --> 01:51:09.565
You need some help, Ms. Wallace?

01:51:09.674 --> 01:51:13.508
Oh, no, sweetheart. You just had a baby.
You sit right here and relax.

01:51:13.611 --> 01:51:16.171
- Can I hold my grandson now?
- One minute, Ma.

01:51:17.915 --> 01:51:19.883
All right.

01:51:19.984 --> 01:51:23.317
- Thanks for bringing him.

01:51:25.323 --> 01:51:27.985
This little nigga

01:51:28.092 --> 01:51:31.425
Can't this motherfucker be in the world

01:51:31.529 --> 01:51:35.090
As if"motherfucker" is really that much better.

01:51:35.199 --> 01:51:37.531
Both of y'all need to watch your language
around my grand children.

01:51:37.635 --> 01:51:39.398
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's time to eat.

01:51:39.504 --> 01:51:41.768
I'll take the baby so you can eat.

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.032
Uh! Say grace.

01:51:47.645 --> 01:51:50.341
Dear God.

01:51:50.448 --> 01:51:52.916
Thank you.

01:51:57.388 --> 01:51:59.856
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:52:01.959 --> 01:52:04.223
I thought it was perfect.

01:52:22.013 --> 01:52:24.413
We loved him too!

01:52:40.231 --> 01:52:42.165
Biggie Smalls!

01:52:53.711 --> 01:52:58.341
My son, Christopher Wallace, told stories.

01:52:58.449 --> 01:53:02.476
Some of them were funny,
some of them were sad...

01:53:02.587 --> 01:53:04.350
some of them were violent...

01:53:04.455 --> 01:53:08.357
but people listened.

01:53:08.459 --> 01:53:14.022
I'm saddened that his life
was cut down at the age of 24...

01:53:14.131 --> 01:53:19.865
but I find solace in knowing
that he became a man...

01:53:19.971 --> 01:53:22.633
and he was ready to live.

01:53:25.209 --> 01:53:28.770
As I looked out
at all those faces...

01:53:28.879 --> 01:53:31.177
something happened.

01:53:31.282 --> 01:53:34.843
Someone in the crowd
turned on their radio...

01:53:34.952 --> 01:53:39.946
and I could hear my son's voice.

01:53:44.328 --> 01:53:46.262
