00:01.585 --> 00:04.793
So, I'm thinking 35.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.336
Seems high to me.

00:06.423 --> 00:09.586
Uh-huh.
That's a fair price
for quality like this.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.340
I'll give you 30.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.759
(LAUGHS)

00:15.933 --> 00:18.720
What?
I thought you were joking.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.267
Who am | dealing
with here, Eddie?
Him or you?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.970
Mickey, relax.

00:23.065 --> 00:27.058
Now, if things move
forward with Gorski,
he lets us into Philly,

00:27.152 --> 00:28.688
then maybe
I cut you a break.

00:28.779 --> 00:32.112
You cut me a break now
or maybe you don't
get with Gorski.

00:35.661 --> 00:39.620
Marco, I thought we
had an understanding.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.154
Whoa, whoa.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.203
Tommy, don't be stupid.
Put the gun down.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.875
First, he shows you
some respect.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.080
All right,
just listen to your boss,
all right, moron?

00:49.174 --> 00:50.505
Shut up.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.968
Just relax, buddy,
all right?

00:59.810 --> 01:00.890
What the hell
are you thinking?

01:00.978 --> 01:02.058
I didn't shoot him.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.976
You sure? Look at him,
he's face down
in the pavement.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.271
l nailed myself
in the foot!

01:11.488 --> 01:12.523
I don't think he's hit.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.569
Well, then,
what happened?

01:13.657 --> 01:15.318
Let's get out of here.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.656
Come on, Mickey, wake up.
Mickey! Wake up!

01:20.163 --> 01:21.778
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:56.783 --> 01:58.284
We almost done here?

01:58.368 --> 02:01.360
Assuming you did this
shaving your forehead.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.866
Okay, then.
I'm ordering a head CT.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.913
No,ldont
have a headache,

02:06.001 --> 02:08.208
I'm not dizzy.
Eddie, I gotta get back.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.831
You gotta stay here.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.128
We'll straighten out
that mess with Marco
tomorrow.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.591
Let the doc do his job.

02:13.675 --> 02:17.839
Actually, stitching you up
is really the ER doc's job.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.716
Yeah.
Too long of a wait.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.049
Yeah. Also, a lot
of cops in the ER.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.553
Not that you'd
care about that.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.559
So, how did this happen?

02:32.903 --> 02:35.360
Yeah, you're right.
It's a stupid question

02:35.447 --> 02:37.654
'cause the answer's
kind of obvious.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.323
No scrapes on your hands
means you didn't try
to break your fall,

02:40.410 --> 02:42.366
means you were
either out cold

02:42.454 --> 02:44.820
or totally disoriented
when you went down.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.655
No sign of trauma,
other than the cut,

02:46.750 --> 02:48.661
means no one hit you
in the head.

02:48.752 --> 02:53.121
And powder burn
on yourjacket sleeve
means someone shot a gun.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.083
All right, Eddie.
Come on, let's go.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.670
I don't care what
you guys are into.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.131
If you don't get
this checked out,
it'll happen again.

03:04.768 --> 03:05.757
What Will?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.353
This.
(LOUD BANGING)

03:14.111 --> 03:15.271
Cool.

03:16.822 --> 03:21.031
Thirty-two-year-old
man recently developed
loud-noise-induced vertigo.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.530
CT was clean,
no internal bleeding,
no edema.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.952
Everything else
is in the file.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.371
Cameron get your hair
in the divorce?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.289
This guy
strained his back
three years ago

03:30.377 --> 03:31.457
and that's it.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.955
All the rest of
these pages are blank.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.207
HOUSE: Yes, he won't
tell us anything.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.630
Understandable,
since he's a drug dealer.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.966
So he's dangerous
and withholding,

03:41.054 --> 03:42.385
which you find
irresistible.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.963
But guys like that,
they never call.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.390
CHASE: He actually said
he was a drug dealer?

03:47.477 --> 03:48.557
Not out loud.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.886
But he was wearing
a solid-gold
Patek Philippe,

03:50.981 --> 03:54.394
his friend had a Rolex,
but their phones
were prepaid burners,

03:54.484 --> 03:56.736
so they can toss them
as soon as they're done.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.981
FOREMAN: It doesn't
matter if this guy's
a drug dealer or not.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.063
Noise-induced vertigo
means ear or brain.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.570
Head CT was clean,
so I'm thinking
acoustic neuroma.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.400
We need to do an ABR
to test his hearing.

04:05.495 --> 04:09.579
Acoustic neuroma fits,
so does lidocaine
toxicity or benzocaine,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.577
depends what he's
cutting the coke with.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.080
So now he's not
just a drug dealer,
he's a cocaine dealer.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.911
He seemed peppy.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.247
You test his ears,
I'm gonna go test
his cocaine.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.797
You think this guy
is just going
to hand over

04:19.885 --> 04:23.252
a briefcase full
of illegal drugs
because you ask nicely?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.722
I hope not.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.008
(NORA LAUGHING)

04:29.102 --> 04:31.593
So, the best coffee's
at Geena's

04:31.688 --> 04:33.770
and the best pizza
is at Gino's.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.347
Yeah, and don't
mix those up,

04:35.442 --> 04:38.024
'cause the coffee at Gino's
could kill you.
(LAUGHS)

04:38.111 --> 04:39.692
And how's the dry cleaner
on the corner?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.316
Go two blocks
over to EcoClean,

04:41.406 --> 04:45.024
the one on the corner
used to shred all
my boyfriend's shirts.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.358
Good to know.
In retrospect,

04:46.453 --> 04:49.069
I should really
thank those cleaners.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.830
We broke up.
This is my stop.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.703
So if you have
any more questions

04:53.794 --> 04:56.206
about the neighborhood,
I'm your girl.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.914
Uh, favorite sushi place?
Maybe we could
get dinner sometime.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.294
Sure, if you promise
to bring

05:02.385 --> 05:04.216
that good-looking guy
with the cane.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.173
You mean House?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.175
Your boyfriend's name
is House?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.641
He's not my boyfriend.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.888
Oh.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.308
I'm sorry. What do
you call each other?

05:16.399 --> 05:19.061
Husband?
Partner? Lover?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.526
We're not gay.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.982
Seriously?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.827
You're going to
hear a series of
clicks and hisses.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.654
The sensors measure
electronic activity
to your auditory nerve.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.454
How long is
this gonna take?

05:33.542 --> 05:36.204
An hour, maybe
an hour-and-a-half.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.411
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.839
Guy's probably late
to a stabbing.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.508
lmpedances look good,

05:45.595 --> 05:49.053
starting at
13 clicks per second
at 50 decibels.

Check this out.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.977
Thirteen's middle name
is Beauregard?

05:56.773 --> 05:58.388
Wave 3 latency is 3.8.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.189
Slightly delayed,
but nothing significant.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.767
That's what
sticks out to you?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.899
House is clearly
screwing with us.
It's a fake pay stub.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.196
Looks real to me.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.864
There's no way
she makes that much money.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.816
I make that much money.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.450
And apparently,
you don't.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.120

Works for Jack Bauer.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.343
Is this really necessary?

06:28.471 --> 06:31.053
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.473
But way less
genre-appropriate.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.259
Okay, here's the deal.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.433
I need information.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.261
You have reasons
not to give me
that information.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.938
So either I can
force it out of you

06:42.527 --> 06:43.903
or I can't.

I mean hosiery.

with culottes.

Is that with
a ”C” or. a ”K”?

07:05.342 --> 07:08.084
'C.” Nobody wants K
any more.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.385
Does your friend
cut the fabric?

07:10.472 --> 07:12.428
No, he's a sales guy.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.471
Well, he must cut a culotte
here and there.

the culottes.

They'll figure out
we're straight,
eventually.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.706
"Eventually" is not
when I want to go out
with the cute girl in 38.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.042
Any chance I could get
some water over here?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.546
If only there was
some way

07:51.638 --> 07:53.799
to communicate that
information to her,

07:53.890 --> 07:56.131
perhaps using,
I don't know, sounds.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.887
If only the larynx
was capable of...

07:57.978 --> 08:01.596

you were gay.

isn't secretly trying...

anyway?

of healing people,

10:28.419 --> 10:29.750
you’d think they’d
have better chicken soup.

10:29.838 --> 10:30.918
You bugged his room?

10:31.005 --> 10:32.461
Our patient sleeps
in the building

10:32.549 --> 10:34.210
where they keep
their stash.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.506
Eventually,
he'll say something

10:35.593 --> 10:37.584
that gives away
where that is.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.135
Then we'll find out
what's making him sick.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.962
But we ruled out
environmental causes.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.467
You ruled out
environmental causes.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.720
TAUB: And you
pretended to agree

10:44.811 --> 10:46.551
just so we'd take
him out of his room

10:46.646 --> 10:48.056
so you could
plant the bug.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.480
Carotid stenosis
was a decent idea.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.979
But an even
decent-er idea is that

10:53.069 --> 10:54.934
he's got toxins stored
in his fat cells.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.769
Every calorie he burns
makes him sicker.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.730
If we're going
with toxic exposure,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.737
we should just
start testing for
the most likely suspects.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.661
Bug's a better idea
than blindly running
tests for days.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.453
(LOUD FEEDBACK)

11:08.710 --> 11:10.701
Tell him
it'll take weeks.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.911
It'll be faster.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.454
What do you mean,
weeks?

11:14.549 --> 11:17.211
These tests take time,
there are a lot
of possibilities.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.884
I can't sit here
this long.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.427
I got things
I gotta take care of.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.721
If you're worried about
all the poor schoolchildren

11:23.808 --> 11:25.344
going without
their drugs,

11:25.435 --> 11:28.427
I'm sure someone...
I want to be discharged.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.179
I'll get the forms.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.702
CHASE: This is ridiculous.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.165
Beats sitting
in a lab all day.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.989
In the lab,
there is significantly

11:50.084 --> 11:51.745
less chance of
getting killed.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.916
You're too close,
slow down.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.086
We're in a car
in broad daylight,
what's gonna happen?

11:55.173 --> 11:56.879
You honestly think
he doesn't have a gun
in that car?

11:56.966 --> 11:58.297
That he's gonna use
to shoot doctors?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.547
Just back off.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.549
(EXHALES)

12:04.641 --> 12:06.552
Hey, well played
with the watch,
by the way.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.928
Borrowed it
from a friend.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.680
How much longer
are we gonna
keep lying to him?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.762
Until it's no longer fun.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.227
We all thought
he needed to be
taken down a few notches.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.435
So, we're just having fun,
not getting even?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.144
Oh, crap.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.229
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.110
He's gonna get away.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.368
(SIREN WAlLlNG)

12:29.916 --> 12:31.201
(SNORTS)

12:31.292 --> 12:32.623
Shut up.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.838
3B. You're Nora, right?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.673
My roommate tells me
you're the one to thank

12:44.806 --> 12:47.218
for all the tips about
the neighborhood. Greg.
(LAUGHS)

12:47.308 --> 12:48.923
Nice to meet you.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.351
I hear you thought
that Wilson and I liked

12:52.438 --> 12:55.020
to polish
each other's swords.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.100
And by swords,
I mean pistols.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.276
Of course
he told you about that.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.981
Don't worry. Actually,
I'm surprised that it
doesn't happen more often.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.861
We're both straight.

13:12.875 --> 13:17.995
Oh, my God,
that is beautiful.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.798
We finally have
the room to display it
the way it deserves.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.795
Would you help me
get this upstairs?

13:26.889 --> 13:28.265
Absolutely.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.434
Nice shoes, by the way.
Loubouﬂns?

13:34.355 --> 13:35.390
Did you talk
to Cuddy?

13:35.481 --> 13:36.982
Shot me down.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.442
So, what are you
going to do now?

13:38.526 --> 13:39.982
I'll wait for
my review in August.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.320
Oh.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.232
What?

13:44.324 --> 13:48.567
Nothing.
That's what I would do.
But I'm a coward.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.452
(PAGER BEEPING)

13:56.502 --> 13:58.288
His friend
brought him in
15 minutes ago.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.711
Temp's 105,
pulse is weak and thready.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.459
He's not making
any sense.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.835
It's too much money,
Eddie.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.383
That wasn't the deal.
That wasn't the deal.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.551
Is he gonna be okay?

14:07.638 --> 14:08.673
Eddie!

14:14.270 --> 14:16.352
TAUB: We gave him
anti-pyretics
and soft steroids

14:16.439 --> 14:18.100
to reduce the fever
and prevent organ damage.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.476
He's no longer
delirious.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.398
Patient went out,
came back worse
than before.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.727
Points us back
to environmental,
tied to wherever he went.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.277
No, it doesn't.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.021
Where's Foreman?
He had a meeting
with Cuddy.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.401
THIRTEEN: What do you mean,
no, it doesn't?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.484
We screwed up the tail,
my car was impounded.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.785
True, amusing,
and irrelevant.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.281
Foreman fall for
the pay check thing?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.501
Yeah.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.454
Maze/ tov.
Should be fun to watch.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.583
You're off environmental?
Wherever he went,

14:46.677 --> 14:47.883
it wasn't
for long enough.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.961
Add in the fever
and infection's
way more likely.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.546
And if it is
an infection,

14:51.641 --> 14:55.725
his symptoms suggest
it's moved to his brain,
which means...

14:56.437 --> 14:58.519
We'll do
a lumbar puncture.

15:01.526 --> 15:05.235
Next time you're
tailing someone,
take two cars.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.192
You knew we were
following you?

15:08.282 --> 15:09.488
(LAUGHS)

15:09.992 --> 15:12.074
I'm sorry,
had to lose you.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.947
I had business
to take care of.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.371
Right, because
you're a businessman.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.959
You know how many junkies
come into the ER

15:19.043 --> 15:20.499
every week with
their brains melting?

15:20.586 --> 15:23.578
I bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out,

15:23.673 --> 15:25.288
but a liquor store owner
laying on this table,

15:25.383 --> 15:26.998
I'm guessing he doesn't
get attitude.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.378
(GROANING)

15:28.469 --> 15:29.925
I hit bone.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.139
His old back injury
must have flattened out
his discs.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.430
Sorry, but I've got
to try this again.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.973
Are you okay?
Yeah.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.436
An adult wants
to get wasted,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.227
why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

15:40.314 --> 15:43.306
Because some of
those substances
are against the law.

15:43.401 --> 15:46.268
So your problem isn't
that it's immoral,

15:46.362 --> 15:48.523
your problem is
that it's illegal.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.989
I got the same problem.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.868
(EXHALES)

15:58.082 --> 16:00.073
Look at his heart rate.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.954
It's normal.
I know.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.300
I ran into Nora
this morning.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.922
She told me about your
Evita listening party.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.798
The London and
New York recordings
are so different.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.384
You were supposed
to tell her
that we're straight.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.640
She didn't
believe me either.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.062
You're doing this
to mess with me.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.686
Correction.
I started doing this
to mess with you.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.937
Now I'm honestly
trying to hit that.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.112
By pretending you're gay
and in a relationship
with me?

16:31.199 --> 16:33.906
We're in a relationship,
but we're really unhappy.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.324
Communication's
never been easy for us,

16:35.411 --> 16:37.151
probably because
we're so closeted.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.406
I've got it all
figured out.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.160
Nora and I spend
the next few weeks
hanging out,

16:41.250 --> 16:44.834
become best girlfriends,
l confide in her
about our issues.

16:44.921 --> 16:49.335
I can't decide if
this plan is more
despicable or illogical.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.212
Then one night,
we get drunk,

16:52.303 --> 16:56.012
backrub turns
into a front rub,
and the next morning,

16:56.098 --> 16:58.134
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before."

16:58.226 --> 17:00.683
That's quite
a commitment you've made

17:00.770 --> 17:03.182
tojumping the girl
I'd like to date.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.853
I'd like to date her.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.023
In the sense that
I'd like tojump
her repeatedly.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.315
I saw her first.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.189
Seriously?
You're invoking
the Guy Code?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.862
We're guys.
It's a code.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.190
You're only
bringing this up

17:15.284 --> 17:16.615
'cause you know
you're going to lose.

17:16.702 --> 17:17.862
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

17:17.954 --> 17:18.989
It's not an infection,

17:19.080 --> 17:21.913
but it might be
an autonomic
nerve disorder.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.705
The hair's
still bumping me.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.159
Did you get it cut
because you're ready
for the next chapter or...

17:26.254 --> 17:29.041
We stuck a needle
into his spinal bodies,
twice,

17:29.131 --> 17:30.632
his heart rate
stayed normal.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.581
If we add that to
his other symptoms...

17:32.677 --> 17:34.918
That would be a mistake.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.674
She's never
gonna fall for it.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.507
Well, then,
you've got nothing to
worry about, sweetie.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.975
You're a wuss.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.603
Say that when I'm better.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.811
What, are you
gonna beat me up?
That sounds stressful.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.397
Maybe you should
pop one of your
beta-blockers first.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.232
You have a heart problem?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.864
Medically, no.
He would've told us
about that.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.491
Metaphorically...

18:12.800 --> 18:16.042
It's an effect
from operating
outside of the law.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.129
Sometimes,
I have to do bad things,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.635
and not always
to bad people.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.302
Last few months,
that hasn't been so easy.

18:26.522 --> 18:30.606
A guy got me the pills,
and they control the stress.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.231
Look, don't say
anything to Eddie,
all right?

18:34.322 --> 18:37.280
Last thing I need is
the guys thinking
that I've gone soft.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.108
When was your last pill
before we originally
admitted you?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.944
Um... The night before.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.906
Then we stuck you in here
and you went into
beta-blocker withdrawal.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.456
That's what caused
the hypertension.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.124
When he got out of here,
he took another pill,

18:49.211 --> 18:50.462
and the hypertension
went away,

18:50.546 --> 18:51.752
which means
it was never a symptom.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.706
We take that off the table,
we've got vertigo, fever...

18:54.800 --> 18:57.462
And stress.
He's been in this game
for a while,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.794
either he grew a conscience
over the last few months,

18:59.889 --> 19:02.471
or he's producing
excess adrenaline.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.974
Pheochromocytoma.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.301
What?
That's Greek for

19:06.395 --> 19:09.603
"you'll be back doing
bad things to good people
in no time."

19:09.690 --> 19:12.272
MRl his adrenal glands.
You're okay with that, right?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.396
You're not gonna put
a pillow over his face?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.727
(LAUGHS)

19:19.492 --> 19:22.905
Oh, great,
the cable guy came.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.668
Hello.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.915
Hi, James.
We've got some
Kung Pao left.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.918
Oh, God.
Right there.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.633
We're having a picnic.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.176
With wine.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.594
l'll pour you a glass.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.671
He doesn't drink.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.801
Oh.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.507
More for us then.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.894
Well,

19:51.440 --> 19:57.436
I think I might
have a little Kung Pao.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.410
How did it go
with Cuddy?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.409
She told me
I needed leverage,

20:13.504 --> 20:15.916
so I told her
about an offer

20:16.006 --> 20:18.418
I had to help run
the neuro department
at Mercy.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.628
Wow.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.673
Are you really
gonna take the job?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.755
There is no otherjob.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.011
l bluffed,
she called it.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.093
I'm not gonna beg
to be underpaid.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.475
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.896
House is lying to you.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.231
I know.

20:40.698 --> 20:41.904
And so are you.

20:41.991 --> 20:46.200
It's 2010. I mean,
nobody cares if
you're gay any more.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.322
I mean,
you don't have to
be in the closet.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.402
(LAUGHING)

20:48.497 --> 20:49.828
I'm not.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.035
Look around you.
Does this really

20:52.126 --> 20:55.243

21:02.219 --> 21:06.007
My ex-boyfriend
didn't even know what
window treatments were.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.572
I get it.
Finally.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.203
You're jealous.

21:28.287 --> 21:33.077
If you want to spend
more time with Greg,
you should just tell him.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.702

21:38.798 --> 21:41.335

of a pheochromocytoma,

21:41.425 --> 21:43.256

Mickey's stress
is just stress.

We're back to
vertigo and fever.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.885

back at the top of

narrow down

your shirt...

21:52.353 --> 21:54.594
Actually, I've resorted to
something more exotic.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.770
I call it reading
the instructions.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.315
Turns out,
if you screw the antennae
into the wrong sockets,

22:00.402 --> 22:02.393
it doesn't actually work.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.487
We lost Mickey just
outside of Trenton.

22:50.953 --> 22:54.696
Valium or Xanax

Beta-blockers just control

23:46.926 --> 23:48.382
Knowing this guy's
an undercover cop

23:48.469 --> 23:49.879
doesn't get us
any closer to curing him.

about the womanly art

which suggests
it's not autoimmune.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.001
So we're stuck
with environmental.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.545
But what kind of
environmentals?

26:31.632 --> 26:33.497
Toxins? Parasites?
Allergens?

26:33.592 --> 26:36.208
We should just pick
the top 10 possibilities
and treat for all of them.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.588
Except that treating
for everything could

26:37.679 --> 26:39.635
kill him faster than
whatever's killing him.

26:39.723 --> 26:40.758
Got a better idea?

Sort of.

Did an embolization
and stopped the bleeding,

32:45.297 --> 32:48.755
but then it started up
again this morning.
Three more aneurysms.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.795
These look like
mycotic aneurysms,

32:50.886 --> 32:52.296
indicates
a fungal infection.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.969
That'd be consistent
with his other symptoms,
the vertigo, the fever...

32:55.056 --> 32:57.547
I didn't see any fungus
at the location,
and none of the samples...

32:57.642 --> 32:59.849
Looks like somebody
missed something,

32:59.936 --> 33:02.143
which is embarrassing
for somebody.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.141
And the steroids
we gave him would

33:04.232 --> 33:05.733
have suppressed
his immune system.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.105
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.186
Somebody's got
a good point.

33:11.281 --> 33:15.194
One bleed to four
in less than 12 hours
seems like an uptake to me.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.946
We need to start him
on antifungal meds

33:17.037 --> 33:19.779
before he drowns
in his own blood.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.407
Do it.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.411
How long till it
starts working?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.748
Give it a few hours.
I'll be back
to check on you.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.587
(COUGHING)

33:49.778 --> 33:52.269
There you go.
Take it easy.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.786
You shouldn't have
taken her there,
you imbecile.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.579
They found nothing,

34:05.168 --> 34:07.375
and you could've got
your brains blown out.

34:07.462 --> 34:11.831
I had to do something.
I couldn'tjust sit
and watch and...

34:12.884 --> 34:14.124
(SIGHS)

34:18.807 --> 34:20.468
You're my friend.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.184
Thanks.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.813
You'd do it for me.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.693
(LAUGHS)

34:31.361 --> 34:32.476
Ah!

34:33.196 --> 34:34.902
I should get going.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.447
Got the big man from Philly
coming in tonight.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.115
(COUGHING CONTINUES)

34:44.457 --> 34:46.789
You want me to stay,
I'll stay.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.834
I mean, Jimmie knows
everything that we know.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.207
No.

34:53.008 --> 34:55.624
For the six months
we put in on this,

34:58.680 --> 35:00.386
you gotta be there.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.720
I'll swing by tomorrow.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.265
Hey, Eddie.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.027
Yeah?

35:15.697 --> 35:17.062
I'm sorry.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.358
You know,
that I can't go with you.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.705
(CLICKING TONGUE)

35:30.003 --> 35:31.368
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

35:35.175 --> 35:36.790
It was all our fault.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.750
We were screwing
with Foreman,

35:38.845 --> 35:42.087
trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.298
Obviously, things got
out of control.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.600
Someone does something
stupid and insensitive,

35:47.687 --> 35:50.394
I always figure
it was House.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.514
Good to know
it's catching.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.815
Look, there is
no otherjob.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.142
He was just trying
to get a raise.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.818
Even if you gave him
a little more money,
I know he'd stay.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.817
I'm not giving
Foreman a raise

35:59.908 --> 36:02.490
because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.442
We know.
And that's why
we want you

36:04.537 --> 36:06.744
to take it out
of our pay checks.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.405
You two okay with this?

36:11.670 --> 36:12.659
Is there
any other option?

36:12.754 --> 36:14.335
We're okay with it.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.674
Foreman is
a good team leader.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.836
He deserves it.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.591
Okay, then.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.927
That is what I will do.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.135
And just so you know,

36:27.560 --> 36:28.845
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:28.937 --> 36:32.304
I haven't seen Foreman
in three days.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.528
The phrase
"Who's your daddy?"
comes to mind.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.037
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

36:59.634 --> 37:01.716
You wanna grab
some coffee?

37:01.803 --> 37:03.543
Kind of a bad time.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.011
Sorry.
You told me to drop by,

37:06.099 --> 37:07.760
so this is when
I could make it.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.807
Right. Come in.

37:17.110 --> 37:21.649
This whole thing
with Wilson,
it's all my fault.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.527
We're not closeted
because we're not gay.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.320
ForreaL

37:27.746 --> 37:29.452
Wilson thought
you were cute,

37:29.539 --> 37:31.495
I was just
yanking his chain.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.582
Maybe that's not
the best phrasing.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.412
So you were only
spending time with me
to screw with him?

37:38.506 --> 37:40.417
God, no. lwas
spending time with you

37:40.508 --> 37:42.044
because I want
to touch your boobs.

37:42.135 --> 37:45.377
Enough to listen
to Evita, twice,
and I really hate Evita.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.884
That's how much
I like your boobs.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.894
(STAMMERS)
Wait. Wait, wait.

37:56.483 --> 38:01.603
Wilson,
he's a really good guy
and he really likes you.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.031
Well, it's really...

38:07.118 --> 38:10.110
It's sweet of you
to stick up for
your friend like that.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.665
And you're still trying
to sleep with me.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.790
Maybe I will call him,
it would serve you right.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.712
Wilson's a jerk, too.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.836
At least he tried to
do the right thing.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.633
He's been
divorced three times,

38:25.720 --> 38:27.381
he slept with
a dying patient.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.430
Sure, he looks like
a Boy Scout, but that...

38:42.403 --> 38:44.018
(COUGHING)

38:50.537 --> 38:52.277
The aneurysms
look mycotic,

38:52.372 --> 38:54.909
but they're not,
they're inflammatory.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.999
Because it's not
a fungal infection.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.168
The hypertension
was a real symptom.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.496
You've been
unwittingly treating it
with beta-blockers.

39:02.590 --> 39:06.082
You stopped taking them
and your blood pressure
went up.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.048
It's Hughes-Stovin.

39:11.224 --> 39:14.011
Okay, so how
do we treat this?

39:19.774 --> 39:21.310
We don't.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.858
Hughes-Stovin is
an autoimmune disease.

39:23.945 --> 39:27.153
Once it's this advanced,
there's not much we can do.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.364
The aneurysms
keep multiplying.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.692
Eventually,
one of them will rupture.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.030
Are you sure?

39:38.459 --> 39:41.292
If you die in
the next day or so,
lwill be.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.088
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

39:46.175 --> 39:48.427
it wouldn't have
made a difference.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.130
You did the right thing.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.720
I think I should
call my wife now.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.677
(INAUDIBLE)

41:52.385 --> 41:54.171
(CHATTERING ON TELEVISION)

41:56.431 --> 41:58.672
I'm sorry
about your patient.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.933
He died a hero
in his own mind.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.682
Iguessits
better than nothing.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.054
Ran into Nora
in the elevator.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.141
She no longer
thinks we're gay,

42:09.235 --> 42:11.772
now she thinks we're
mendacious dirtbags.

42:13.072 --> 42:16.109
Mendacious dirtbag
comes much more
naturally to me.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.283
At least we can
get rid of that.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.323
I kind of like it.

42:21.831 --> 42:23.367
Unlike this sofa.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.494
It's 500 bucks.

42:25.585 --> 42:28.622
And it reclines.

42:31.466 --> 42:37.427
(SINGING)
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes

42:37.513 --> 42:39.378
I will punch you
in the face.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.806
I'll stop if you
get rid of the sofa.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.679
No chance.
(SCATTING)

42:44.771 --> 42:50.311
One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes

42:51.611 --> 42:57.982
One smile and
suddenly nobody else will do
