00:02.089 --> 00:04.743
[knocking]Dr. Rosen?

00:04.830 --> 00:06.267
Ah, Ms. Flynn.
Please come in.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.572
Okay. Thank you.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.096
I'm a little nervous.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.098
I've never done
the therapy thing before.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.708
Well, lucky for us, I have.

00:12.795 --> 00:13.796
[both laugh]

00:13.883 --> 00:14.797
Please, take a seat.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.494
Is this a test?

00:16.581 --> 00:17.756
If I sit on the left side,
do I hate my mother,

00:17.843 --> 00:19.149
and the right side I'm OCD?

00:19.236 --> 00:20.411
[laughs]

00:20.498 --> 00:21.543
It's more a question of comfort.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.848
Okay.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.676
Well, the "I hate
my mother" chair

00:24.763 --> 00:26.809
looks pretty comfortable.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.420
Oh...
[clears throat]

00:29.507 --> 00:30.334
You know what?
Actually, it's not.

00:30.421 --> 00:33.076
I'm just gonna...

00:33.163 --> 00:34.947
I don't have OCD,
just for the record.
Okay.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.862
[exhales]
Just sit there.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.560
You know what, I want to...
[exhales]

00:38.647 --> 00:39.909
Right off the bat,
I just want to say that

00:39.996 --> 00:41.432
I don't really
need to be here.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.130
My husband was kind of,
you know,

00:43.217 --> 00:44.957
into the whole
"you should try therapy,"

00:45.045 --> 00:47.569
and my insurance is running out
and you're on my plan,

00:47.656 --> 00:49.136
and, you know, I was just
getting my-my teeth cleaned

00:49.223 --> 00:51.703
right around the...
you know, the...

00:51.790 --> 00:53.227
if you kind of go left,
and-and I thought,

00:53.314 --> 00:54.315
well, you're getting
your teeth cleaned,

00:54.402 --> 00:56.360
maybe get your noggin cleaned.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.754
So you didn't want to come?

00:58.841 --> 01:00.451
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:00.538 --> 01:01.931
I mean, I'm very, uh...

01:02.018 --> 01:03.498
I'm very interested
in the process.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.239
I'm curious, I'm a writer.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.936
Oh. How long have you
been doing that?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.981
Oh... gosh, six months.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.201
Going on seven months.
Yeah.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.769
An, uh, did you have a job
before becoming a writer?

01:13.856 --> 01:16.685
Why do you want to know that?

01:16.772 --> 01:18.295
Uh, just
background.

01:18.382 --> 01:19.862
Oh, um...

01:19.949 --> 01:20.993
Yes, I was
a teacher

01:21.081 --> 01:22.865
for ten years,

01:22.952 --> 01:24.475
and it was very fulfilling.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.911
I-I would not trade

01:25.998 --> 01:27.261
that time for anything.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.350
Why'd you leave?I couldn't breathe.

01:30.699 --> 01:31.961
I mean, not-not like,
uh, literal, you know...

01:32.048 --> 01:34.224
"I can't breathe!"

01:34.311 --> 01:36.835
Just like, uh, like
a metaphorical suffocating,

01:36.922 --> 01:38.098
like, "You're squeezing
the life out of me!"

01:38.185 --> 01:40.622
[laughs]
Kind of like, uh...

01:40.709 --> 01:42.014
I don't know, I would say
like a python killing a...

01:42.102 --> 01:44.060
what is it, like...
a jack rabbit.

01:47.498 --> 01:48.412
So you walked out.

01:48.499 --> 01:52.677
I... jumped out of...

01:52.764 --> 01:53.591
...a window.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.680
[clears throat]

01:55.767 --> 01:57.943
Metaphori...Literally.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.119
Literally jumped, okay. Yeah.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.991
That's
interesting.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.298
Oh, you're really
writing that down.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.473
Huh.
Well, you know, it's...

02:05.560 --> 02:07.083
really it was kind of boring.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.258
You know, it was...
it was not a big deal.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.912
It was kind of
a little,

02:09.999 --> 02:11.914
tiny little bit of a big deal
at the time...

02:12.001 --> 02:12.958
Still writing, huh?

02:13.045 --> 02:14.090
Yeah?
But, uh...

02:14.177 --> 02:16.223
I've kind of done so many things

02:16.310 --> 02:17.659
that have eclipsed that, so...
[laughs]

02:17.746 --> 02:19.791
Could you be
a little more specific?

02:19.878 --> 02:21.532
Let's see, if I had to...

02:21.619 --> 02:22.142
[grunts]
You have to come up
with something.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.231
Um...

02:24.318 --> 02:26.146
I-I guess maybe
I've been drinking, you know,

02:26.233 --> 02:28.104
a little... a little bit
more than usual.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.410
I mean, not like getting drunk,

02:29.497 --> 02:30.846
but just to kind of...
[exhales]

02:30.933 --> 02:33.370
You know, just...
I guess get drunk. So...

02:33.457 --> 02:34.371
But I don't want
to go into

02:34.458 --> 02:36.025
all the circumstances,

02:36.112 --> 02:38.419
'cause it's a big,
long-winded story,

02:38.506 --> 02:40.116
but at the end you would say,
"Oh, that seems reasonable,"

02:40.203 --> 02:42.118
but I may have punched
someone in a bar

02:42.205 --> 02:45.426
and gotten her tooth
in my hand, here.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.428
Again,
I think

02:47.515 --> 02:49.386
if you heard the whole thing,
you would... you would say...

02:49.473 --> 02:51.258
God, I'm tal...
I feel like I'm talking a lot.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.781
I mean, it's just...

02:52.868 --> 02:54.391
Even when I'm thinking
"stop talking,"

02:54.478 --> 02:55.305
this is still going
and I'm still talking.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.220
You're doing great.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.656
Really?
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.875
Maybe you should tell
my husband that.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.442
'Cause he was... he was the one

03:01.529 --> 03:03.444
that was so into me doing
this therapy thing,

03:03.531 --> 03:05.228
and really, he's the one that...
that needs to be here.

03:05.315 --> 03:08.449
His mother...
I mean, she's controlling,

03:08.536 --> 03:10.190
overbearing, manipulative...

03:10.277 --> 03:12.148
I mean, she is a...
ooh, that's a piece of work.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.586
So you don't get
along with her?

03:15.673 --> 03:16.587
[laughs]

03:16.674 --> 03:18.328
No, I do not.

03:18.415 --> 03:22.332
I mean, we've almost gotten into
a physical fight before.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.334
And then, I mean, that's not
even going into the whole thing

03:24.421 --> 03:26.728
where I had fantasies about
murdering her. And I know...

03:26.815 --> 03:28.425
I just
want to...

03:28.512 --> 03:30.122
I want you
to know

03:30.210 --> 03:31.950
that I know that that sounds...

03:32.037 --> 03:33.996
that sounds... odd.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.868
But if you... again, bird's-eye
view of that whole thing,

03:36.955 --> 03:38.914
you'd say, "That's reasonable."Uh-huh.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.093

03:44.180 --> 03:46.269

04:07.029 --> 04:08.422
Hey, there
she is.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.945
Hey. What are you doing
with your mom's car?

04:10.032 --> 04:11.729
Ah, she wanted me to
get her oil changed.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.209
But if she asks you about
the extra miles on the odometer,

04:13.296 --> 04:15.037
I did not pick you up.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.038
So, how'd it go?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.039
Good, good.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.346
I'm cured.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.566
Really?
That is such a relief.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.872
I'm kidding.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.831
So am I.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.573
There's nothing to be cured of.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.183
I mean, therapy's
an ongoing process.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.750
It's not like a one-and-done
kind of thing.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.752
Well, is it a three-and-done
kind of thing?

04:34.839 --> 04:37.102
'Cause that's all that's
covered by the insurance.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.018
You know, I-I gotta admit,

04:40.105 --> 04:42.369
when I was first going in,
I was a little skeptical,

04:42.456 --> 04:44.588
but after talking to Dr. Rosen,

04:44.675 --> 04:47.243
it did feel a bit of
a burden was lifted.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.114
That's great.
It is.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.377
You should really
consider going.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.247
Why? I'm not
the one who's...

04:51.334 --> 04:53.293
Who's what?

04:53.380 --> 04:55.730
Who's what,
huh?

04:55.817 --> 04:57.297
...going through
something.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.211
Really?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.996
So all...
you just have

05:01.083 --> 05:02.693
healthy relationships
across the board, huh?
Yeah!

05:02.780 --> 05:04.173
If they're not healthy,
I yank 'em out of my life

05:04.260 --> 05:06.218
like a wild nose hair.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.743
I was talking about
your mom, Mike.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.353
Now that's not fair.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.702
Nobody has a healthy
relationship with her.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.965
She prides herself on that.

05:14.052 --> 05:16.228
But you don't have
to give in to
her manipulation.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.882
I mean, she knows
you're in OA,

05:17.969 --> 05:20.189
but she's constantly trying
to buy you off with food.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.538
Case in point,
an oil change

05:21.625 --> 05:24.149
for the pan of brownies
in the backseat.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.673
Did you smell 'em,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.414
or did the blanket
covering them shift?

05:27.501 --> 05:29.894
Neither. I saw the ice scraper
has brownie on it.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.511
Did you hear
about the camel?

05:39.991 --> 05:41.819
Is this a joke?

05:43.473 --> 05:45.214
I wish it was.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.869
Apparently, the two-hump camel
is soon to be extinct.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.134
We're gonna be livin' in
a one-hump camel world.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.005
Huh?

05:54.092 --> 05:55.311
Explain that
to your grandchildren.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.747
That happened on our watch.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.662
I didn't do anything.

05:58.749 --> 05:59.707
Exactly.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.013
Hey, speakin'
of things

06:02.100 --> 06:05.930
that are ornery and spit...

06:06.017 --> 06:07.758
how awful do you think
my mother is?

06:07.845 --> 06:10.108
I mean, on a scale
of one to ten.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.110
Is ten good or bad?

06:12.197 --> 06:12.807
Bad.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.069
Huh.

06:14.156 --> 06:14.809
It only goes up to ten?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.637
All right.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.290
CARL:
Look, look,

06:18.378 --> 06:19.988
y-your mom might not be
the most nurturing,

06:20.075 --> 06:21.685
but she's nothing compared
to a mama polar bear.

06:21.772 --> 06:22.773
You know, something wrong
with her offspring,

06:22.860 --> 06:26.168
she gonna eat that baby up.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.213
Not gonna see that
in a Coke commercial.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.302
Well, Molly thinks

06:30.390 --> 06:32.174
I might benefit from
talking to somebody

06:32.261 --> 06:34.132
about my relationship
with my mom.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.699
What, like a therapist?
You don't need that.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.396
That's what I thought.'Cause you got me.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.400
Wouldn't it be awkward

06:40.487 --> 06:41.966
to say my problem

06:42.053 --> 06:43.620
to my problem?

06:43.707 --> 06:45.100
[chuckles]

06:45.187 --> 06:47.058
Besides, I'm just not
the therapy type.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.712
I'm more of a "let it fester

06:48.799 --> 06:51.672
until it kills me from
the inside" kind of guy.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.108
You know what your trouble is?

06:53.195 --> 06:54.631
You don't have any troubles.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.850
What are you talkin' about?

06:55.937 --> 06:57.417
In Africa,

06:57.504 --> 06:59.331
we don't get in touch
with our feelings.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.159
We're too busy trying to get
in touch with food and water.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.118
I'm just saying,

07:03.205 --> 07:04.554
when you wake up and see your
neighbor's head on a stick,

07:04.641 --> 07:06.991
it puts everything
in perspective.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.560
You know, you-you
actually might want

07:10.647 --> 07:12.519
to talk to somebody
about that.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.303
Probably.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.744
Uh, did you get
a chance to fill out

07:20.831 --> 07:22.224
the family questionnaire
I gave you last time?

07:22.311 --> 07:23.965
Oh, yes, I did.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.488
I have it
right here.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.621
I might have gotten
a little carried away.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.013
I, uh...

07:29.100 --> 07:30.972
I took a psychology class
in college

07:31.059 --> 07:32.582
and, yeah, so I took the liberty

07:32.669 --> 07:34.584
of kind of making
some of my own conclusions.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.718
But I-I, I did
ace that class.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.023
Oh.
But you'll
see that.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.242
Oh, yeah, there are
my transcripts.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.069
You'll see
for yourself.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.244
And then...
Oh!

07:42.331 --> 07:43.680
Me in fourth grade.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.768
[laughs]

07:47.205 --> 07:49.381
Okay, I see quite a few sections
on your mother here.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.296
Oh, yeah.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.342
I know it's cliché,
but so is she.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.778
You know, drinks too much,

07:54.865 --> 07:55.997
more of a...
a friend than a mother,

07:56.084 --> 08:00.436
more of a nudist
than a nurturer.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.046
Mm-hmm.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.222
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love my mother.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.659
I mean, yeah.
She-she-she just probably,

08:05.746 --> 08:07.487
you know, shouldn't have...
been one.

08:09.663 --> 08:10.402
Huh.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.883
What "huh"?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.537
Well, I'm not seeing much
on your father here.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.932
Oh, well, 'cause he-he died
when I was ten.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.499
So there's not much
to say about it.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.065
Great guy, wonderful father...

08:21.152 --> 08:22.589
end of story.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.504
Pretty short story.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.681
Well, I don't really remember
a lot about him.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.554
I mean, not like in
a "blocking it out" kind of way.

08:31.641 --> 08:32.555
Not like that.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.601
[laughs]
No.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.736
No.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.565
What? I mean,
he was a-a fantastic father.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.219
You know?
Took me to ball games

08:44.306 --> 08:45.873
and the park, he doted on me.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.309
Sorry to disappoint you,

08:47.396 --> 08:49.224
but no Daddy issues here,
you know?

08:49.311 --> 08:51.705
Move along, nothing to see.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.271
[laughs]

08:53.358 --> 08:54.229
[clears throat]

08:54.316 --> 08:55.404
Stare all you want.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.667
It's not gonna...

08:57.754 --> 08:59.539
not gonna change anything,
you know?

08:59.626 --> 09:02.933
Great guy, died early,
leave it alone.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.937
You know what? I don't have
to sit and listen to this.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.591
You know, you want
to drag my mother's

09:08.678 --> 09:10.419
name through the mud,
I'll sit here all day.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.248
But I will not let you sully
my lovely father's memory.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.293
Good day.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.947
We still have 50 minutes.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.341
Oh. I... I said good day!

09:23.824 --> 09:25.739
Where the hell do you
get the set of balls

09:25.826 --> 09:27.262
to tell your wife
she needs therapy?

09:27.349 --> 09:28.306
I can't even
tell Joyce

09:28.393 --> 09:29.481
she needs
a breath mint.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.312
Well, her insurance is
gonna pay for it.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.575
And in light of
recent events,

09:35.662 --> 09:36.750
I didn't think
it could hurt.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.360
I should say not.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.754
As a matter of fact,
therapy saved my life.

09:40.841 --> 09:41.842
You're kiddin'.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.278
Y-You've been to a shrink?

09:43.365 --> 09:44.758
Oh, yeah.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.498
When my wife Bunny died,
I was a wreck.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.499
For six months
I laid on that couch,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.676
poured my heart out.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.200
Wow.
In a million years

09:52.287 --> 09:53.375
I'd never take you for
a guy who'd go to therapy.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.595
There's a sensitive heart

09:55.682 --> 09:56.596
beating under
this savage breast.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.078
And my therapist was good.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.167
Helped me through my grief.

10:03.254 --> 10:06.562
Also figured out
why I'm so anally fixated.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.697
All right,
nice talk.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.135
Turns out, I used
to have trouble

10:14.222 --> 10:17.007
making BMs
as a child.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.313
I went to camp one summer

10:18.400 --> 10:19.662
and didn't go for three weeks.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.359
Yeah? What was
the name of it,

10:21.446 --> 10:23.927
Camp Can't-do-caca?
[laughs]

10:24.014 --> 10:25.276
Oh.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.364
You think you're
the first one

10:26.451 --> 10:27.148
to make that joke?

10:27.235 --> 10:28.410
I heard 'em all.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.542
Does a Vince crap in the woods?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.545
No, he does not.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.200
Okay, okay, I got it.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.593
And from that summer on,

10:37.680 --> 10:40.248
I couldn't flush
until my mom inspected it

10:40.335 --> 10:41.641
and put a little star
in my doo-doo journal.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.907
We're cooking food here.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.778
To this day, every election

10:48.865 --> 10:51.128
when I get
that little "I Voted" sticker,

10:51.215 --> 10:53.522
I got to make a beeline
straight to the can.

10:56.046 --> 10:59.136
So, sweetie, how was therapy?

10:59.223 --> 11:00.616
Did you get to blame enough
stuff on your poor mother?

11:00.703 --> 11:03.358
Oh, I had pages on you.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.969
That idiot wouldn't even hear
any of it.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.841
Did you tell the
therapist about the time

11:07.928 --> 11:09.538
Mom left us in the car
to go to Oktoberfest?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.540
No, that's good. I...

11:11.627 --> 11:12.933
See, I blocked that.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.372
So, when do you go back?

11:17.459 --> 11:19.374
I don't. I quit.
I walked straight out of there.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.245
You know,
some people just need to deal

11:21.332 --> 11:22.769
with things on their own time.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.945
It's not like everybody
needs therapy.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.948
What?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.601
Well, not everybody
needs therapy,

11:29.689 --> 11:33.344
but... some people might.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.650
What is that supposed to mean?Nothing.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.392
I'm just agreeing with...

11:37.479 --> 11:39.524
half of what you said.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.526
Well, it doesn't matter
what you think.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.658
What's going on?

11:42.745 --> 11:44.747
Molly wants to quit therapy.

11:44.834 --> 11:45.748
And we're to scared
to tell her not to.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.273
I'm not.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.710
You're cracking up.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.321
We been talking,
and we all agree

11:53.408 --> 11:55.149
it's best for you to see someone

11:55.236 --> 11:57.673
before they have to shock
the cuckoo out of you.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.414
So you...

11:59.501 --> 12:01.198
so you all agree?

12:01.285 --> 12:02.591
So you've been talking about it
behind my back?

12:02.678 --> 12:03.679
Well, we can't do
it to your face.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.159
We love you.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.423
You know what,
I don't need any of this.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.294
Mol, where you going?

12:10.381 --> 12:12.296
Away from them. You know,
crazy people shouldn't point...

12:12.383 --> 12:14.385
crazy fingers!

12:14.472 --> 12:16.257
Mol!
Mike,

12:16.344 --> 12:17.606
let her go.
In a way, this is a blessing.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.304
How so?I miscounted the meatballs.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.697
Now there's enough
for all of us.

12:31.838 --> 12:32.664
This swing taken?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.101
Well, I don't know.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.798
Joshua's kind of carved
his name into it,

12:35.885 --> 12:39.062
but I don't think
he's coming back tonight.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.411
[chuckles]

12:40.498 --> 12:41.630
You okay?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.763
I don't know.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.070
Uh, therapy today wasn't
exactly what I expected.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.637
Well, what was it like?

12:48.724 --> 12:51.292
It was like Dr. Rosen
had an agenda,

12:51.379 --> 12:55.252
which was getting in the way
of my agenda.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.950
Well, you know me.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.560
I'm all for quitting
something you don't like.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.214
[chuckles] I mean, you
gave it more of a shot

13:00.301 --> 13:02.129
than I did Brussels sprouts.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.696
You were such a baby
about those Brussels sprouts.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.656
If bacon can't save
it, nothing can.
[laughs]

13:09.223 --> 13:10.920
I never even knew
this park was here.

13:11.007 --> 13:14.794
Oh, yeah, I used to come here
all the time with my dad.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.665
Is that right?
Yeah.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.494
He kind of had a way of knowing
when I was having a bad day,

13:19.581 --> 13:21.626
and he'd open up the door
and say, "Come on, peanut.

13:21.713 --> 13:22.976
Let's go find some fun."

13:23.063 --> 13:24.412
That's nice.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.935
Yeah.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.937
He used to stand at the bottom
of that slide,

13:28.024 --> 13:29.286
arms wide open,

13:29.373 --> 13:31.854
beer in one hand,
cigar in the other.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.161
He'd just kind of stop me
with his foot.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.858
[chuckles]

13:35.945 --> 13:36.946
The more I hear about him,
the more I like him.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.818
[phone rings]Yeah.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.561
Ah, geez, it's my mother.[sighs]

13:43.648 --> 13:44.867
I'm just glad she calls

13:44.954 --> 13:46.913
and doesn't send
her flying monkeys.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.785
Take note, I'm
pressing ignore.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.788
Well, look at you.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.921
Yeah, and I happen to know
she's making cobbler tonight.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.661
[laughs]

13:56.748 --> 13:59.708
Well, how about to celebrate
you setting some boundaries

13:59.795 --> 14:01.275
we take a spin
on the merry-go-round?

14:01.362 --> 14:02.493
I don't know...

14:02.580 --> 14:04.234
but I get first turn!

14:04.321 --> 14:05.888
First one there is a square!

14:05.975 --> 14:07.803
I taught fourth grade.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.849
I can go all day.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.548
You know, that was fun.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.071
If we go back in the daytime,

14:15.158 --> 14:16.203
we won't have to share
a merry-go-round

14:16.290 --> 14:17.421
with a crackhead.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.075
I didn't see him.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.425
I mean, until he fell off,
I did not see him.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.084
Dr. Rosen?

14:28.171 --> 14:29.477
Ms. Flynn, I'm sorry.

14:29.564 --> 14:30.608
Do we have an appointment?

14:30.695 --> 14:32.175
We don't, but...

14:32.262 --> 14:34.221
I was kind of hoping...

14:34.308 --> 14:37.659
I mean, I know I had some time
left over from the other day

14:37.746 --> 14:39.617
when I stormed out,

14:39.704 --> 14:41.315
and I was hoping maybe we could
pick up where we left off?

14:41.402 --> 14:42.490
Um,

14:42.577 --> 14:43.404
y-yes. Have a seat.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.057
Yeah? Thank you.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.841
Yeah.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.278
Ooh, look at that.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.453
I just chose a chair right away.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.848
I think we're making progress.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.415
Well, you would know.
You are the one

14:54.502 --> 14:56.983
who aced that
intro to psychology course.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.028
Okay, what's on your mind?

14:59.115 --> 15:02.640
Well, um, I-I think

15:02.727 --> 15:05.774
I'm ready to kind of
fill in some of those blanks.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.384
About your father?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.299
[sighs]
Yes. So,

15:09.386 --> 15:10.779
what do you want to know?

15:10.866 --> 15:13.216
Why don't you just talk?

15:13.303 --> 15:14.957
Okay, um...

15:15.044 --> 15:17.090
I mean,
I know there's something...

15:17.177 --> 15:21.050
you know, there with...
between me and my dad.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.009
I just...
I don't know what it is,

15:23.096 --> 15:25.402
and every time I...

15:25.489 --> 15:26.926
I think about him,
I have to stop,

15:27.013 --> 15:31.365
'cause I just feel too much.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.757
What do you feel?

15:32.844 --> 15:34.846
Boy, you are nosy, huh?

15:36.022 --> 15:38.502
Thank you.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.810
I feel the usual.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.073
I feel sad, I...

15:44.160 --> 15:46.119
I miss him,
I feel guilty. I...

15:46.206 --> 15:48.295
Guilty?

15:48.382 --> 15:49.078
I guess.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.385
Why guilty?

15:51.472 --> 15:54.257
I hate that I'm so mad at him.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.390
Why are you mad at him?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.523
'Cause he left me, you know?

15:59.610 --> 16:02.352
I mean, he was supposed
to be there for me,

16:02.439 --> 16:04.354
and then he died, and...

16:04.441 --> 16:06.922
he wasn't.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.011
And, you know, at ten years old,
I had to step up

16:09.098 --> 16:11.971
and be the responsible one
in the house.

16:12.058 --> 16:15.278
Why did you feel
you had to take on that role?

16:16.323 --> 16:17.715
Oh, I keep forgetting

16:17.802 --> 16:19.195
you haven't met my mom
and my sister.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.849
[sighs]

16:20.936 --> 16:22.024
Uh...

16:22.111 --> 16:24.200
Trust me, I had to...

16:24.287 --> 16:26.159
grow up really fast,

16:26.246 --> 16:28.422
and, you know,
do the right thing

16:28.509 --> 16:30.859
and get good grades
and find a steady job and...

16:30.946 --> 16:32.992
[sighs]

16:33.079 --> 16:34.036
Sounds like you were busy.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.821
[scoffs quietly]

16:36.908 --> 16:39.041
By the time I looked up
from the laundry pile, I was 30.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.132
So all this acting out

16:43.219 --> 16:46.092
seems like you were...

16:46.179 --> 16:48.137
making up for lost time?

16:48.224 --> 16:50.270
[chuckles]

16:50.357 --> 16:51.793
Finally experiencing

16:51.880 --> 16:55.101
the childhood
that you'd put on hold?

16:55.188 --> 16:57.494
That's good.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.409
I mean, that's...

16:59.496 --> 17:01.020
that makes me sound
like less of a nut job.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.764
Well, I can assure you,
Ms. Flynn,

17:06.851 --> 17:08.462
you are not a nut job.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.508
I'd love it if you could
write that down,

17:11.595 --> 17:13.902
so I could show my family.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.036
No, really, could you?

17:17.123 --> 17:18.037
Oh, you really want me
to do that?
Yeah.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.913
You know all my craziness lately
is because of you, right?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.045
What did I do?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.655
Well, first of all,

17:27.742 --> 17:30.962
your big mistake
was making me feel so safe.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.402
Therapist said
I haven't had stability

17:35.489 --> 17:36.881
like that since my dad.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.623
'Cause of that, I was...
I can try new things

17:39.710 --> 17:42.626
and been able
to kind of take risks

17:42.713 --> 17:44.237
I haven't done
since I was younger.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.108
So, if I was no-good,
hard-drinking loser,

17:46.195 --> 17:48.458
you'd still be a teacher?

17:48.545 --> 17:50.243
Of course.
What other choice would I have?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.636
I don't know how I
feel about all this.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.377
You should feel great.

17:54.464 --> 17:58.251
Here, open that
while I fire up this stogie.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.601
Your dad sure did
like cheap beer.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.081
[exhales]

18:02.168 --> 18:04.822
Wait till you taste
the cheap cigar.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.958
So, the therapist
recommended this?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.482
Sort of.

18:12.569 --> 18:16.269
He said he wanted me
to find a way to forgive my dad

18:16.356 --> 18:18.836
and say good-bye to him
in a real way.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.316
Cheap beer and
cheaper cigars?

18:20.403 --> 18:22.362
He liked what he liked.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.669
Okay, raise them up.

18:26.279 --> 18:29.195
To you, Dad.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.022
I miss you.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.460
I miss your laugh.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.070
I miss the way your...

18:35.157 --> 18:37.072
aftershave smells.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.509
I miss holding your hand.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.597
[sniffles]

18:40.684 --> 18:43.296
Most of all,

18:43.383 --> 18:46.212
I miss that you weren't able
to walk me down the aisle

18:46.299 --> 18:49.215
when I married
the love of my life.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.956
[sniffles]

18:53.349 --> 18:54.959
It's nice to
meet you, sir.

18:55.046 --> 18:55.743
[laughs]

18:55.830 --> 18:57.658
Don't worry.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.486
I'm gonna take
real good care of her.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.229
I'm glad you're here with me.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.752
Me, too.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.014
Switch.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.016
[sighs]
Oh... oh, yes, yes, yes.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.155
You know, now that we've gotten
me all straightened out,

19:16.242 --> 19:18.069
we may need to take a peek
under your hood.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.420
Come on.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.336
Let me just finish your dad's
crappy cigar in peace.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.426
All right, but you can't live
in denial forever.

19:26.513 --> 19:27.601
[laughs] Watch me.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.993
[laughs]

19:36.784 --> 19:38.046
[clears throat]
So, uh,

19:38.133 --> 19:39.482
why'd you want to see me?

19:39.569 --> 19:40.657
Oh, I think it's helpful

19:40.744 --> 19:42.311
to have the spouse involved

19:42.398 --> 19:44.183
in the healing process.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.532
Great.
Anything I can do to help.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.881
All right, well,
why don't you

19:46.968 --> 19:48.317
tell me something
about yourself?

19:48.404 --> 19:51.059
Okay, well, uh, I'm
a police officer.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.495
I am happily married.[chuckles]

19:52.582 --> 19:54.062
[phone rings]

19:54.149 --> 19:55.281
[sighs]

19:55.368 --> 19:56.282
Oh, geez.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.284
Is it your mom again?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.634
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna take it.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.244
Does your mother call often?All the time.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.680
[laughing]:
She won't leave me alone.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.334
I mean, I know
I'm her only son,

20:05.421 --> 20:07.771
and I'm all she's got left
in this world,

20:07.858 --> 20:09.469
so that responsibility
falls on me,

20:09.556 --> 20:11.035
and it's a lot.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.472
I mean, I'm just one man.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.518
I don't know
how much more I can take.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.216
I mean,
nothing's ever good enough.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.131
She just takes and takes
and takes!

20:20.219 --> 20:21.916
There's no end to it!

20:22.003 --> 20:23.265
It's never gonna stop!

20:23.352 --> 20:24.266
Can I have some
tissues, please?

20:24.353 --> 20:27.356
[sobbing]

20:27.443 --> 20:30.185
[whispering]: See,
I told you. I told you.
