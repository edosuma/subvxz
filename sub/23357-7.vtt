00:11.879 --> 00:13.681
Hey, Rog.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.085 --> 00:19.753
- Previously on The Resident...
- Hey, Noni.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.922
You are looking lovely today,
as always.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.892
Every reputable hospital
is trying to recruit Carver.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.995
How are your surgical error
and complication rates?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.730
Transparency
and accountability force us

00:29.763 --> 00:31.399
to weed out the bad
and grow the good.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.267
- I need Bell.
- You know what to do.

00:33.301 --> 00:36.270
I pushed Dr. Okafor to exceed
my expectations,

00:36.304 --> 00:37.881
and, sadly, on this day,
she wasn't ready.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.541
So you are finally cleared for
your bone marrow transplant.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.443
We can start
your conditioning today.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.445
Lily's in acute renal failure?

00:44.478 --> 00:46.280
If we proceed with
the transplant, she'll die.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.348
What's going on?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.882
You were right.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.751
We have to do something
about Lane.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.223
Have you thought about
the wedding?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.758
No. It stresses me out.

00:57.791 --> 01:01.095
150 guests
is well within our budget.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.197
150 guests is within our budget,

01:03.231 --> 01:06.867
but none of these 150 guests
include friends,

01:06.900 --> 01:08.636
- only our families.
- Well,

01:08.669 --> 01:10.271
we got to have our families
there.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.707
But do we, really?

01:13.741 --> 01:16.710
Okay, maybe not yours.

01:16.744 --> 01:20.948
This is why I want to elope.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.117
Sure.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.786
Or...

01:27.355 --> 01:29.657
No. I'll be late for work.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.792
- Yeah. I don't care.
- I know you don't care,

01:31.825 --> 01:35.229
but I need you to care.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.731
I'm serious, Devon.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.434
It's my job...

01:47.975 --> 01:49.743
That was nice.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.913
Yeah. Yeah, very much.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.453
You don't have to stay.

02:00.488 --> 02:04.024
You trying to get rid of me?

02:04.057 --> 02:06.594
Let's just call this
what it is, Conrad:

02:06.627 --> 02:08.496
A rebound thing.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.497
: It's not.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.701
It's not a rebound thing, I...

02:13.734 --> 02:15.536
Nic and I,
we split up a while ago.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.439
No, I meant it's...

02:18.472 --> 02:21.008
it's my rebound thing.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.545
Yeah, right. You and Tucker.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.214
All right. Okay.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.718
I should go.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.986
I...

02:33.020 --> 02:35.055
I got to get back to my place.
I got to change.

02:35.088 --> 02:38.392
No one's stopping you.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.279 --> 03:00.914
It's big.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.851
And getting bigger.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.155
It hurts like hell..

03:08.188 --> 03:10.358
Yeah.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.261
I think I need to go
to a doctor.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.471
Ooh. Someone didn't go home
last night.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.275
Apparently not.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.576
Ooh, look at you,

04:02.610 --> 04:04.077
pretending not to care.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.213
I'm not pretending.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.181
Hey, when you get a minute?

04:12.820 --> 04:15.255
Yeah. -You had a chance to talk
to Conrad about Lane

04:15.289 --> 04:16.923
and her near.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.892
Yeah. He said,

04:19.927 --> 04:21.995
"Well done."

04:22.029 --> 04:23.631
You saved her life.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.241
That's kind of what we do
around here, Nic.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.676
Yeah, but wouldn't it be nice
if your job

04:26.700 --> 04:28.445
was to help sick people,
not save sick people

04:28.469 --> 04:29.670
from their doctors?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.305
It would be my first choice.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.106
Yeah.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.309
What's on your mind?

04:35.343 --> 04:37.645
I want to report Dr. Hunter
to the state board

04:37.678 --> 04:39.513
for overly aggressive treatment,

04:39.547 --> 04:41.515
but if we could just get
a closer look

04:41.549 --> 04:42.859
- at her patients files...
- She keeps all

04:42.883 --> 04:44.752
of her patient records
at her clinic.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.530
She doesn't even let
Lily's doctors see them.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.289
I know...
but what if you told her

04:49.323 --> 04:51.659
that you were interested
in writing a research paper

04:51.692 --> 04:53.594
on her protocols?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.629
What's up?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.164
Hey, um, just talking about,

04:57.197 --> 05:00.167
Hunter's patient,
Darryl Phillips.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.470
Judy called in sick,
so I'm helping her out.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.338
I thought Lane banned you
from her patients.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.939
Yes, so I'll keep a low profile,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.108
and you'll keep your voice down.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.445
70, retired postal worker,
just got some bad news.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.347
"CT scan and tumor markers

05:13.381 --> 05:15.449
"are highly suggestive
of smallcell lung cancer

05:15.483 --> 05:17.217
with obvious mets to the liver."

05:17.250 --> 05:19.853
Lane didn't give him
a prognosis.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.356
He has maybe six months or less.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.692
And she wants to do a biopsy,
chemo, radiation.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.794
She might be able to buy him
a couple extra months.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.730
Look, I was just hoping
you could talk to him

05:29.763 --> 05:32.966
and help him figure out
his priorities.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.568
How was your evening?

05:34.602 --> 05:36.069
Stayed in. Watched TV.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.409
Mary. Why don't you shut up?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.243
No, you shut up, you old toad.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.879
Nicki, please get
this stoop lady out of here,

05:45.913 --> 05:47.581
or I'll get a restraining order.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.717
Well, aren't you two adorable?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.985
Darryl, Mary.
This is Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.087
He's gonna ask you
a series of questions

05:54.121 --> 05:56.400
designed to help you figure out
where you want to go from here.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.059
Well, I know where I'm going.
Home.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.261
Okay, that's a beginning.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.597
Tell me what you're most
afraid of.

06:03.631 --> 06:07.200
Well, besides dying and going to
hell, I'm not a fan of snakes.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.537
He's afraid of being serious.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.171
I'm serious.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.874
I'm serious as stage IV
lung cancer,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.544
which I have, apparently,

06:16.577 --> 06:19.913
even though I still feel pretty
damn good, right now.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.882
I'm guessing that'll change

06:21.915 --> 06:25.385
if I start all these treatments
Dr. Hunter wants to do.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.855
But Darryl, what if those
treatments work?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.523
Where you been, Mary?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.291
There's nothing
that's gonna fix this.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.061
Dr. Hunter says she can extend
your life.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.696
It's possible.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.131
She's had success
with many patients,

06:38.165 --> 06:41.101
- but there are no guarantees.
- I know too many folks

06:41.134 --> 06:42.903
who've been through this hell.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.707
All this will do is rob me of
the few good months I have left.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.643
Isn't that the truth, Doctor?

06:49.677 --> 06:53.747
- It's a possible scenario, yeah.
- Well, I don't want that.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.817
I don't want a few more days
in the hospital.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.754
I've accepted there's not enough
time to drive across country,

07:00.788 --> 07:05.092
so I'll settle on just
cleaning out the garage.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.928
The garage? Why you keep
bringing up that damn garage?

07:07.961 --> 07:10.263
The man asked me
what scares me, Mary.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.566
What scares me is leaving you

07:12.600 --> 07:14.468
with hospital bills
you can't pay

07:14.502 --> 07:16.269
and a hoarder's garage.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.405
There's a lot of crap
to sort through.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.942
Tons of boxes, old paint cans...

07:21.975 --> 07:24.945
and a certain VHS tape
you misplaced.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.346
Shush.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.049
Peter will help me.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.520
I want to help you,

07:32.553 --> 07:34.822
and that means
skipping the treatment.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.423
Dr. Hunter wants to do a biopsy.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.592
Why? We know
what's wrong with me.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.094
To identify the type of tumor
and target therapy.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.632
Well, no therapy,
so no biopsy. Simple.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.437
Okay.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.439
That's clear to me.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.343
Great. More time at home
with the ball and chain.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.154
All right, I'll have Dr. Hawkins
talk to your doctors

07:58.178 --> 07:59.747
and we'll get you discharged.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.052
Well, I was hoping
to start this meeting

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987
with some good news.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.222
However, it seems that
Chastain has fallen out

08:09.256 --> 08:10.691
of the Top 50 Hospitals

08:10.724 --> 08:12.793
on the U.S. News & World Report.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.628
Well, maybe that's
one of the reasons

08:14.662 --> 08:15.972
that we couldn't convince the
best surgeon in the northeast

08:15.996 --> 08:17.164
to leave St. Grace

08:17.197 --> 08:18.666
and come to Chastain.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.001
Yeah, what happened
to Carver, anyway?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.703
I thought Randolph here
was a closer.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.076
Well, we were miles apart
in salary,

08:29.109 --> 08:31.545
and Dr. Carver was also

08:31.579 --> 08:34.481
pushing for publicly disclosing
complication rates,

08:34.514 --> 08:37.317
which leave us susceptible
to lawsuits. -True.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.486
But I have been thinking
it's time that we consider

08:39.519 --> 08:41.188
more transparency
here at Chastain,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.356
on our own terms.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.725
Some of the same hospitals

08:44.758 --> 08:45.935
that are beating us
in the rankings

08:45.959 --> 08:47.160
are doing just that.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.337
Like tracking and identifying

08:48.361 --> 08:50.263
offending physicians.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.599
Just get rid
of repeat offenders.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.166
Like Dr. Mina Okafor.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.436
Okafor is not a problem.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.439
She removed the wrong testicle
from a patient.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.274
Terminating Dr. Okafor
will send a message

09:01.308 --> 09:02.743
to coasting physicians

09:02.776 --> 09:05.078
without resorting
to a disagreeable amount

09:05.112 --> 09:06.556
- of public transparency.
- Okay, look.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.457
If we terminated doctors
based on medical errors,

09:08.481 --> 09:09.549
this room would be empty.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.085
But if our CEO prefers,

09:12.119 --> 09:15.188
I will send Emory
the more challenging cases

09:15.222 --> 09:17.357
that made Chastain famous,

09:17.390 --> 09:18.759
and we can focus on becoming

09:18.792 --> 09:20.728
the tonsillectomy capital
of the world.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.399
That's his nickname.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.602
His real name
is Spalding Massero.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.756
He's a concierge doctor who
practices out of New York.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.316
His patients
are rich highprofiles

09:33.340 --> 09:35.275
from all over the world.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.812
He charges the big fees,
we do all the work.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.714
First time I've been
in the VIP wing.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.783
I haven't even stayed
in hotels this nice.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.318
There they are.
Come on over, gentlemen.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.988
Conrad, you remember
Dr. Spalding Massero.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.991
Our residents,
Dr. Hawkins, Dr. Pravesh.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.902
I remember Conrad Hawkins
via the U.S. Marine Corps

09:52.926 --> 09:55.595
in Afghanistan. How's your dad?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.965
- The same.
- Devon Pravesh.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.767
Harvard Medical and Yale?

09:59.800 --> 10:02.235
You got it right.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.509
Dr. Massero was just telling me

10:03.536 --> 10:04.938
about his hole in one
at Spyglass.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.607
Was it official? Any witnesses?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.242
Well, you insult him.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.443
And Steph Curry.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.780
- And Larry Ellison.
- Okay.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.949
We done fluffing here?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.287
As will all of
Dr. Massero's patients,

10:20.320 --> 10:23.356
this has to be handled discreetly.
Yes.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.997
Bobby, get off that leg.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

10:31.799 --> 10:33.867
That is Bobby Singer.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.169
The first baseball game
I ever went to

10:36.203 --> 10:37.838
with my dad, Bobby pitched.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.276
I am looking at the two doctors

10:43.310 --> 10:45.345
who stand between my patient
and his dream

10:45.378 --> 10:47.881
to finally pitch
in a World Series.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.889
I had knee surgery a couple
years back, so I figured

10:55.923 --> 10:58.191
- I tweaked it, but...
- Team doctors don't think

10:58.225 --> 10:59.793
- it's structural.
- Yeah, it looks like

10:59.827 --> 11:02.562
- deep vein thrombosis.
- That sounds bad.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.898
DVT is a blood clot.
It's good you're here.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.200
Yeah, he'll need blood thinners
and a surgical consult

11:07.234 --> 11:10.503
for a possible thrombectomy.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.248
We're in the middle of a pennant race.
Yeah, I know.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.741
Surgery's good.
You want surgery.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.575
Surgery's quick,
and so is the recovery time.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.687
Before we address his return to
the game, let's figure out why.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.388
Mr. Singer's leg is swelling...
We'll need ultrasounds

11:19.412 --> 11:21.514
of his upper and lower
extremities and a CT pelvis.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.417
If he has a clot,

11:24.451 --> 11:26.353
he'll need a full
hypercoagulable workup,

11:26.386 --> 11:30.891
including factor V Leiden,
protein C, and S levels.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.493
If all goes well,
we'll get you out of here

11:33.526 --> 11:35.763
- in a couple of hours.
- No. We'll keep him overnight,

11:35.796 --> 11:38.165
We're gonna do

11:38.198 --> 11:40.768
everything we can
to get you back on that mound.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.935
All right. Thanks, man.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.436
I mean, Dr...

11:43.470 --> 11:45.505
Devon.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.675
Just... you know what,
just call me Devon. -Devon.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.778
All right. Thanks.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.550
So why do they call him
"Dr. Smooth"?

11:57.584 --> 11:59.452
Massero hates conflict,
he hates drama

11:59.486 --> 12:01.688
and he really hates
delivering bad news to patients

12:01.721 --> 12:03.523
who pay him a lot of money
not to hear it,

12:03.556 --> 12:06.927
so he outsources the tough love
to grunts like us.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.063
Which makes me think
Bobby has a big problem.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.434
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.869
So, Noni?

12:15.903 --> 12:18.071
We've got a DVT consult on Six.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.773
He might need
surgical management.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.975
Yeah, I'll check my schedule.

12:22.009 --> 12:25.012
Fair to say you're over Nic.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.085
Our clinical volume
is growing so fast,

12:32.119 --> 12:34.654
we're having difficulty
moving them through the system,

12:34.687 --> 12:36.432
which is probably
what happened to Mrs. Shea.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.658
Okay, and Darryl Phillips?

12:38.691 --> 12:41.829
I need someone to perform
his biopsy today.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.465
Excuse me. Regarding
Mr. Phillips's biopsy.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.766
Are you following Mr. Phillips?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.068
He is not.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.669
I am now.
I was asked to speak with him

12:49.702 --> 12:52.572
after he had second thoughts
about his treatment.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.083
As you know,
his prognosis is terminal.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.676
And how would you know that
for sure without the biopsy?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.345
CT scan and tumor markers
are suggestive

12:58.378 --> 13:00.680
of smallcell lung cancer
with mets to the liver,

13:00.713 --> 13:01.949
stage IV.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.152
His prognosis is extremely poor.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.820
Yes,

13:06.854 --> 13:08.788
and with what little time
he has left, he'd like

13:08.822 --> 13:10.934
to get his affairs in order
and be at home with his wife.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.093
Well, a biopsy
helps us definitively tailor

13:13.126 --> 13:15.262
his treatment,
especially in the event

13:15.295 --> 13:17.197
that it's not
smallcell lung cancer.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.533
Mr. Phillips doesn't want the
biopsy, since he doesn't want

13:20.567 --> 13:22.769
a treatment that's unlikely
to change his outcome.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.037
Unlikely?

13:24.071 --> 13:26.506
We punt
on unlikely outcomes now?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.441
We do not.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.143
Even if it is smallcell,

13:30.177 --> 13:32.479
chemoradiation is still
an option worth exploring.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.883
I will speak to the patient,
make sure he understands

13:35.916 --> 13:38.551
the upside of chemo one more time.
OOkay,

13:38.585 --> 13:40.329
so iin the future, just so
I'm clear, in these tumor board

13:40.353 --> 13:42.165
meetings, we don't factor in
what the patient wants?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.656
I'm just asking,
so I don't waste

13:43.690 --> 13:45.158
any more of your valuable time.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.559
That's enough, Conrad.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.628
All right,
I need someone to perform.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.163
Mr. Phillips's biopsy today.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.364
Where is Vincent?

13:51.398 --> 13:54.734
I'm free this afternoon.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.503
- I can do it.
- Thank you, Jude.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.738
But I think we should wait
for Dr. Vincent.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.341
Okay, thank you, everyone.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.410
Conrad.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.920
I want you there
when I talk to Mr. Phillips,

14:12.953 --> 14:14.554
so there's no more confusion.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.426
What was that?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.094
The patient
doesn't want the biopsy.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.529
Well, I didn't argue for one.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.097
I just volunteered
to do the procedure.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.166
Darryl Phillips
just wants to go home and die,

14:26.199 --> 14:28.211
but there's no money in it
for Chastain if he leaves

14:28.235 --> 14:30.837
- without more treatment.
- Okay, calm down.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.672
What is this?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.274
Is this about me and Nic?

14:34.307 --> 14:37.010
This has nothing
to do with you and Nic,

14:37.044 --> 14:38.587
and everything to do
with Darryl Phillips,

14:38.611 --> 14:40.047
whose dying wish is to go home.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.881
Okay, don't you forget:

14:41.915 --> 14:44.918
I'm the attending, and you're
the resident, brother.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.854
So, technically, you outrank me,
but that doesn't change the fact

14:47.887 --> 14:49.689
that you don't know
what you're talking about.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.359
You and I aren't in the military
anymore, brother.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.096
I don't even need to salute you.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.438
You're here to tell me
you saved my job today

15:05.472 --> 15:07.607
at the board meeting.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.242
Word gets around fast.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.811
It does, when you're the one
spreading it.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.290
They were looking
for a scapegoat,

15:14.314 --> 15:15.748
I made sure it wasn't you.

15:15.782 --> 15:19.752
That should make you
the opposite of angry.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.230
No, I'm here to tell you
we'll be able

15:21.254 --> 15:22.622
to work together again
as partners.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.159
I think we had
some nice momentum going.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.328
I'm not ready.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.231
I'm sorry.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.201
I am not ready to work with you.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.171
You were right,
what you said at my M&M hearing.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.474
I wasn't ready.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.576
I want to be ready next time.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.646
Well, we won't
put you in a position

15:46.679 --> 15:47.847
to fail again.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.749
No, thanks.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.584
I'll serve my penance studying,

15:51.618 --> 15:54.954
and doing prostatectomies
on the Titian.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.824
Well, yyeah.
You need permission...

15:57.857 --> 16:01.328
I sought and received permission
from the residency board

16:01.361 --> 16:04.164
to work under Dr. Kays
for the next three months.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.001
Excuse me.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.207
What kind of research project?

16:14.241 --> 16:15.818
On your promising treatment
regimen at your clinic.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.877
A retrospective review
focused on outcomes

16:17.910 --> 16:19.779
and diseasefree intervals.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.549
When it's published, it could
bring in even more patients,

16:22.582 --> 16:25.385
and save lives. -And you think
you're the first resident

16:25.418 --> 16:27.854
to approach me about writing
a research paper?

16:27.887 --> 16:30.223
Of course not,
but they're not me.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.294
Well, thank you,

16:34.327 --> 16:37.297
but a manuscript
for a prestigious journal

16:37.330 --> 16:39.666
is already in progress.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.370
Anything else?

16:43.403 --> 16:45.004
No.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.507
Appreciate your time.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.548
She definitely wasn't into it.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.526
Doctors don't mind multiple
papers published, as long

16:57.550 --> 16:59.990
as they're favorable. She just
doesn't want you poking around.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.897
Yeah, maybe it's time
I quit thinking like a doctor,

17:01.921 --> 17:04.022
and start thinking
like a journalist.

17:07.227 --> 17:11.030
Darryl, I know my aggressive
regimen can seem daunting,

17:11.064 --> 17:13.433
but cancer
is a relentless enemy,

17:13.465 --> 17:15.535
and you have to fight it
with extreme prejudice.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.436
You have to fight it
with fire and fury.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.506
You can't just give up.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.008
That's why people from all over
the world come to my clinics,

17:22.040 --> 17:24.544
because I never give up.

17:24.577 --> 17:28.248
Yes, the survival rate
for your prognosis is not great.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.549
Not great?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.718
- It's nil.
- You're wrong.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.754
There's always a chance
that you can be the outlier,

17:34.787 --> 17:37.457
someone who beat the odds.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.758
I told you, honey.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.928
But I need to know my enemy
to fight it.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.131
What do you think, Doc?

17:44.164 --> 17:46.566
Dr. Hawkins
is an incredible doctor,

17:46.599 --> 17:48.401
but he's an internist.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.637
He doesn't treat cancer.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.472
I'm your oncologist,

17:52.505 --> 17:55.275
and I know what I'm doing.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.277
Okay, I guess.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.811
Do the biopsy.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.913
Okay.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.149
Yes.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.416
Thank you.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.290
I saw you pitch a twohitter

18:10.323 --> 18:13.826
against Chicago
in 2014 and lose.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.762
Yeah, on a throwing error.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.730
Find out what's causing

18:17.764 --> 18:19.232
what's causing the clot.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.401
You've been through
Tommy John surgery.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.069
You can come back from this.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.247
All right, so after you fix it,

18:24.271 --> 18:25.838
when can I start throwing again?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.341
- That's up to your team doctor.
- And you,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.076
but you can't come back
too soon.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.811
Well, that depends.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.114
It depends on the results
of the test. -Yeah.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.617
This conversation's not really
constructive right now.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.262
Bobby, I want you to meet
the chief executive officer

18:39.286 --> 18:41.096
of Chastain. She wanted
to come up and say hello,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.755
and, see how you're doing.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.191
We've actually met before.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.326
You helped us
raise awareness and finances

18:46.359 --> 18:48.127
for our children's hospital.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.096
That's right.
It's good to see you.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.432
Well, thank you, Doctor.
I'll take it from here. -Right.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.467
And can I speak to you for a second?
Absolutely.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.636
Thank you again
for choosing Chastain.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.171
Of course.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.674
And, we'll be back
to check on you later.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.276
All right, man.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.844
Hey, is this a bad time?

19:04.877 --> 19:06.279
Yeah.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.353
All right, I'll come back.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.448
Hey, it's all right.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.849
Come on in.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.184
I can sign those for you.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.485
Not for me.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.729
Some of the kids
in the pediatric ward

19:13.753 --> 19:16.189
heard you were up here.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.957
That's great. Here.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.460
- I'm happy to help.
- Thank you.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.329
I can get some swag

19:22.362 --> 19:23.396
for the kids.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.864
Hats, jerseys.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.633
Aw, that's really sweet.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.969
Here. Let me get
your phone number.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.371
It's fine.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.806
Look, if you want,
I can just give you my number,

19:33.840 --> 19:34.983
- and you can contact me when...
- No, no, no.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.075
It's fine, sorry. Here,

19:36.108 --> 19:38.144
I'll just punch it in, here.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.012
There you go.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.748
Thanks again for these.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.556
This has peppers.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.592
I think it's yours.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.595
So how's it going with that,
um, that Pinetree story?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.096
Pinewick.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.898
I told you,
there's not enough evidence yet

19:58.931 --> 20:01.200
to link the toxic landfill
to the clusters.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.935
Right.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.171
Hey, just curious...
Were any of the cancer patients

20:05.204 --> 20:07.840
you interviewed treated
by Dr. Hunter?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.410
Your Lane Hunter?

20:10.443 --> 20:11.578
Yeah.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.280
No. Why?

20:13.313 --> 20:16.215
Just wondering.
If they'd been treated by her,

20:16.249 --> 20:17.860
maybe there'd be evidence
that could link their cancer

20:17.884 --> 20:19.519
with the landfill.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.622
Evidence I could help you get.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.425
That's nice of you.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.727
Just trying to be supportive.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.872
I suppose there could be
patients in the cluster study

20:29.896 --> 20:33.366
that I didn't interview
who were Lane Hunter's patients.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.967
I could try to find them.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.036
Why?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.439
Is there a story here?

20:39.472 --> 20:42.108
Maybe.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.576
For sure, there would be

20:43.610 --> 20:45.220
a conflict of interest
for the both of us,

20:45.244 --> 20:49.148
and the possibility
of bad publicity for Chastain,

20:49.181 --> 20:53.119
so... I would ask you
to just, please,

20:53.152 --> 20:55.922
tread lightly?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.698
You've got to be kidding me.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.235
Everything okay?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.003
Your baseball player
just sent me a picture

21:11.037 --> 21:14.006
of a swollen appendage
that is definitely not his leg.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.676
- Okay, thanks. Yeah, I got it.
- I mean...

21:16.709 --> 21:18.277
Thank you.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.788
I'm gonna talk to Bobby.
He can't do that.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.314
No, don't. I can handle it.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.458
It's not the first time
this has happened.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.216
Jude send one too?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.021
- Very funny.
- All joking aside,

21:29.055 --> 21:30.790
I'm talking to Bobby Singer.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.694
Conrad, I'm serious.
I don't want you going up there.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.596
And, for the record,

21:36.629 --> 21:38.965
Jude and I are just friends,
unlike you and Noni.

21:40.567 --> 21:41.701
Hey.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.769
Yeah, okay. Fine.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.104
Everything all right?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.340
I need a surgeon to do
the Darryl Phillips's biopsy.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.541
Hastings signed in.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.510
He got pulled into a Whipple.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.612
Well, Mina's the oncall resident.
She's in

21:52.645 --> 21:54.046
the penalty box. I'll get Jude.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.059
Yeah, don't bother knocking.
Come on in.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.233
Is there anything else
I can get you, sir?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.868
He's good.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.571
Can I have a moment, please?

22:18.605 --> 22:20.807
Go ahead.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.251
Bad news?

22:32.284 --> 22:34.654
That little selfie you sent
to one of our nurses?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.524
I know you think
it's all in good fun,

22:37.557 --> 22:39.225
like sending over a drink

22:39.258 --> 22:40.769
to a woman you don't know,
but you're wrong.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.896
It's harassment.
So before you leave,

22:43.930 --> 22:46.399
apologize to her.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.570
All right.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.046
If that nurse got a problem...

23:03.082 --> 23:05.217
then she can come
and tell me, all right?

23:07.754 --> 23:10.122
Sit down.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.425
Don't tell me to sit down.

23:12.459 --> 23:15.595
Sats are dropping. He's acutely
short of breath with

23:15.628 --> 23:18.064
pleuritic chest pain.
We need to rule out a PE.

23:18.097 --> 23:21.267
I'm drawing an ABG. -Am I
having a heart attack.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.745
Doubtful, but we need more tests
to be certain.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.604
First test will be drawing blood

23:24.637 --> 23:27.306
to check its oxygen content
to see if the clot in your leg

23:27.339 --> 23:29.375
traveled to your lungs,
but it starts with you

23:29.408 --> 23:31.611
sitting the hell down!

23:31.644 --> 23:35.247
Fine. Don't sit.
We'll do this the hard way.

23:35.281 --> 23:39.719
: Put him on
oxygen and get him to CT stat.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.755
- You enjoyed that.
- Just a little.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.663
What the hell happened?

23:50.697 --> 23:54.000
CT shows a pulmonary
embolism with a small segmental

23:54.033 --> 23:58.070
filling defect. We may have
to switch his anticoagulant, but

23:58.104 --> 24:00.306
this should be treatable
without surgery.

24:00.339 --> 24:02.909
He said you two
got in an argument.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.845
Bobby throwing a clot from his
leg to his chest is unrelated

24:05.878 --> 24:08.080
to our discussion of how
he sexually harasses nurses,

24:08.114 --> 24:11.383
and has everything to do
with his deep vein thrombosis.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.759
We have to treat everyone,
from sexists to Nazis.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.928
That's the gig. -Yeah,
and we can still treat him,

24:21.961 --> 24:23.806
but nowhere is it written
that patients are allowed

24:23.830 --> 24:25.532
to send pics
of their junk to nurses.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.835
Well, this isn't just
any patient.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.738
Too bad for Chastain, I'm not
just any doctor.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.210
So you didn't get the name
of this big shot.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.979
VIP Massero's sending us?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.957
He didn't want to tell me
the name of his patient,

24:41.981 --> 24:43.458
just that it's some wealthy
Chinese businessman

24:43.482 --> 24:45.284
who's gonna be
in the U.S. next month,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.954
so we have to keep it quiet.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.657
Well, shouldn't be too hard.
You haven't told me much.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.525
Massero wants a headliner
for the surgery.

24:52.559 --> 24:55.662
Face of the hospital.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.196
I suggested you.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.331
That's wonderful.
I look forward to that.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.800
I suggested you, even though

25:00.833 --> 25:02.902
you challenged me
at the board meeting.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.873
Claire, I was just
speaking truth to power.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.842
Truth? I'm not so sure of that.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.344
Massero also has
one other condition.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.581
He doesn't want Conrad near
any of his patients anymore.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.483
Not the Chinese billionaire
next month,

25:17.516 --> 25:19.752
nor Bobby Singer,
starting right now.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.389
I'm happy to talk to Conrad,

25:23.422 --> 25:24.824
but we need to have
a conversation

25:24.857 --> 25:26.726
about transparency.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.929
I'm about to get on a call.
We'll do it later.

25:37.403 --> 25:40.506
Definite compression in the left
iliac vein, causing the clotting

25:40.539 --> 25:42.909
- in the iliofemoral vein.
- MayThurner Syndrome.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.277
Treatable with anticoagulants
and surgery, but...

25:45.311 --> 25:47.079
Your idol gets hit
with a line drive

25:47.113 --> 25:49.015
while he's on a blood thinner...

25:49.048 --> 25:50.917
Uncontrollable
internal bleeding.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.886
Bobby's not gonna pitch
this year, maybe even next.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.421
Well, let's pull it together.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.556
Let's come up with a path
that might save

25:57.590 --> 25:59.258
the rest of Bobby's career,

25:59.291 --> 26:02.461
and then put a plan together
to present it to Dr. Smooth.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.963
Conrad, I need to speak to you.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.269
The guy sent Nic a picture...

26:10.302 --> 26:12.080
- Yeah, it's called sexting.
- It's called harassment.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.374
Look, we need Massero
funneling his highprofiles

26:15.407 --> 26:16.575
to our VIP wing.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.244
And membership
has its privileges?

26:18.277 --> 26:20.046
You confronted one
of Massero's patients,

26:20.079 --> 26:21.981
and he thinks
you aggravated his condition.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.283
Doesn't matter what I believe.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.585
And you know what,
if Nic doesn't want to invite

26:26.619 --> 26:28.263
this type of behavior,
she shouldn't be giving

26:28.287 --> 26:29.798
her number out
to a professional athlete.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.924
Come on. Did you just
say that out loud?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.559
Yeah, and I'm gonna
say this even louder.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.895
We don't want you
in a room with Bobby Singer.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.597
Or any of Massero's patients
ever again.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.587
First assist,
you can close up now.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.689
Yes, Doctor.

27:08.695 --> 27:11.798
I have, some good news.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.466
I've been asked to perform
a very delicate surgery

27:14.500 --> 27:18.337
on a foreign VIP next month...
Very hushhush...

27:18.370 --> 27:20.139
And I've chosen you to assist.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.942
What's in it for me?

27:22.975 --> 27:26.679
In success, your skills will
have international exposure,

27:26.713 --> 27:29.215
and, more importantly
for the shortterm,

27:29.248 --> 27:32.852
it will impress your doubters
on the board of directors.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.023
Thank you, but I'm happy here,

27:37.056 --> 27:38.725
and my attending

27:38.758 --> 27:41.427
is very pleased with my work.

27:43.595 --> 27:47.133
Well, that's nice.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.202
But any doctor who handles
a scalpel at Chastain Park

27:50.236 --> 27:53.005
answers to the Chief of Surgery,
which happens to be my title,

27:53.039 --> 27:56.909
and that means you're back
assisting me.

27:56.943 --> 28:00.112
Is that understood, Dr. Okafor?

28:06.085 --> 28:08.087
Welcome back.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.365
- Bell's leveraging you.
- I refuse to do all the work

28:19.398 --> 28:21.267
for no credit
while he gets all the glory.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.202
I'm not the damn help.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.171
I'll tell the board
I'm not ready for surgery,

28:25.204 --> 28:27.673
that I am a menace to medicine.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.051
Council of elders
will never believe you.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.542
You come off as too arrogant

28:30.576 --> 28:32.378
to fool anyone that
you're incompetent.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.780
Thank you.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.147
Anytime.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.452
Okay...

28:40.486 --> 28:41.726
advancing through the carina

28:41.754 --> 28:43.389
into the right main bronchus.

28:46.425 --> 28:50.096
And now into the right
upper lobe bronchus...

28:50.129 --> 28:53.866
and into the lung.

28:53.900 --> 28:57.036
Yeah, I can see the tumor. Okay.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.604
Collecting sample.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.942
Got you.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.646
Here we go.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.681
All right.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.921
And withdrawing the scope.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.074
You can go ahead and call
for my next patient, please.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.764
Oxygen sats
are acutely dropping.

29:25.798 --> 29:26.833
Stethoscope.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.008
I got decreased breath sounds
on the right side.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.310
Give me a 28 French tube, now.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.511
Collapsed the lung.

29:42.849 --> 29:43.850
Scalpel.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.872
Who do you think you are?
You confronted Bobby?

30:05.905 --> 30:07.806
God, you just had to be a hero,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.808
after I told you not to go up there.
He's a VIP.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.553
I went to talk to him
because I knew you couldn't.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.955
Couldn't or wouldn't?
Because I can, and I will.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.480
If you complain
to your supervisor,

30:14.513 --> 30:16.182
they'll just blame you
for being up there

30:16.215 --> 30:17.783
- in the first place.
- So let 'em.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.351
What did you accomplish, Conrad?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.553
Now you can't take Massero's patient.
Winwin.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.198
I don't care if I ever see
Massero again, and guys like

30:23.222 --> 30:24.399
Bobby have to learn they can't
get away with that.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.958
And guys like you have to learn

30:25.992 --> 30:27.335
that sometimes, we want
to take care of ourselves.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.395
You just can't help yourself.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.503
Darryl.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.738
That's unbelievable.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.210
Jude perforated his lung
pulling out the scope.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.083
Great, so now Darryl
is stuck with a chest tube

30:46.112 --> 30:49.015
and the drainage system
until his air leak heals.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.154
He's fine.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.490
We can start radiation mapping
tomorrow, as planned.

30:58.524 --> 31:02.194
I disagree, respectfully,
with that approach.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.863
The biopsy results came back.
It's everything that we thought.

31:04.897 --> 31:08.334
Stage IV. Smallcell.
Statistically hopeless.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.002
Now Darryl can go home.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.837
No, now Darryl
can start radiation.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.273
Once he's mapped,
I've got him prescheduled

31:14.306 --> 31:15.774
for twiceaday treatments.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.543
He'll need 30
over the next three weeks,

31:17.576 --> 31:19.121
and he'll alternate that
with his chemo cycles.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.846
He doesn't want it, Lane.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.681
Patients don't know
what they want, Conrad.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.084
It's up to doctors
to frame their care in a way

31:25.117 --> 31:27.019
so they understand
what's best for them.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.755
Or frame it in a way that hides
everything that's bad from them.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.925
Bottom line,
no one's hopeless in my world.

31:32.959 --> 31:36.328
I look forward to the day when
you're proud to be a doctor.

31:49.841 --> 31:53.612
This was the easy part?

31:58.250 --> 32:00.286
Where's Jude?

32:00.319 --> 32:01.353
In the call room. Why?

32:19.605 --> 32:22.874
I missed a layup.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.682
You're not the first doctor
to cause a pneumothorax.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.022
That air leak will take
two weeks to heal.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.826
Not exactly like he had
a lot of time left.

32:43.495 --> 32:47.833
Well, we need you
out there, so...

32:47.866 --> 32:50.836
you just...
you just got to forget it.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.208
Everything okay in here?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.346
Yeah.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.484
You all right?

33:11.923 --> 33:14.526
You know,
Conrad coming at me today,

33:14.560 --> 33:17.063
and then laying into
Bobby Singer?

33:18.930 --> 33:20.532
That's about you.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.402
No, it is not about me.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.536
It's just what Conrad does.

33:24.570 --> 33:25.904
He'd do it for anyone here.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.939
That's true.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.410
I think he still loves you, Nic.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.581
You need to decide if you're
still in love with him.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.487
Drinks are on me.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.257
I think I paid last time,
didn't I?

33:45.291 --> 33:47.059
I'm sorry to interrupt.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.660
I am Dr. Okafor.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.162
We know who you are, Mina.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.664
I just wanted
to personally thank all of you

33:52.698 --> 33:54.200
for my second chance.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.902
The opportunity

33:56.935 --> 33:59.004
to assist Dr. Bell
in the important surgery

33:59.037 --> 34:01.707
of the top secret foreign VIP.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.243
I am grateful for the confidence

34:04.276 --> 34:05.711
the board is showing in me.

34:05.744 --> 34:08.080
I have learned from my mistakes,
and I promise

34:08.114 --> 34:10.248
to make Chastain proud.

34:10.282 --> 34:13.452
I will never again remove
the wrong organ from a patient,

34:13.485 --> 34:15.887
VIP or otherwise.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.456
Thank you again.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.661
Excuse me.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.065
Hey.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.567
Finally.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.469
You got to do this alone.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.070
I'm off the case.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.039
Dr. Smooth doesn't want
an intern telling him...

34:34.072 --> 34:35.817
First of all, don't call him
Dr. Smooth to his face.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.042
Second, Wilmot,

34:37.074 --> 34:38.210
our dedicated attending...

34:38.244 --> 34:39.378
He split for the weekend.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.280
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.484
Dr. Massero.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.085
Hey, we're about
to make our approach.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.719
I don't have a lot of time.
What's up?

34:48.754 --> 34:50.822
Okay, first, Bobby is stable
on blood thinners,

34:50.856 --> 34:51.922
and his PE symptoms

34:51.956 --> 34:53.659
are in control.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.293
But, the bigger concern

34:55.327 --> 34:57.396
is that Bobby has MayThurner.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.398
Damn it. -We are
suggesting an angioplasty

34:59.431 --> 35:01.233
of the iliac vein
with stent placement.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.235
Followed by six months

35:03.269 --> 35:05.737
of anticoagulation
until the stent incorporates.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.206
Where the hell's the attending?

35:08.607 --> 35:09.908
Yes.

35:09.941 --> 35:13.412
Dr. Wilmot was pulled into a...

35:13.445 --> 35:14.813
emergency consult.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.149
Would you like to wait,
or should I get Conrad?

35:17.183 --> 35:19.117
No. No, not him.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.986
If we start

35:21.019 --> 35:22.821
the treatment plan now,
Bobby could be ready

35:22.854 --> 35:23.998
to play by midseason next year.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.024
Yes.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.593
So you're telling me
Bobby's gonna miss

35:27.626 --> 35:29.428
this postseason
and most of next season?

35:29.461 --> 35:30.772
Yes. -This might have been
his last shot

35:30.796 --> 35:31.963
to play in the Series.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.999
He's gonna be devastated.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.133
I'm sorry.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.868
I, If only
I could tell him in person,

35:36.902 --> 35:39.137
but I got Banksy waiting
in a Seattle hotel room

35:39.171 --> 35:40.872
with carpal tunnel.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.045
If you want,
I could tell the patient.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.114
Yeah? That'd be great,
and then I'll follow up.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.616
Devon, next time

35:50.649 --> 35:51.817
you're in New York,

35:51.850 --> 35:52.960
you're sitting with me
at a Knicks game.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.486
Great. I'm a big Knicks fan.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.621
: You're not a Knicks fan?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.823
No, no. I said
I am a big Knicks fan.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.367
That's too bad, 'cause they're courtside.
No, wait.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.336
Listen, they're telling me
I got to shut this down.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.795
- No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- Thanks.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.197
Massero.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.799
Welcome to the club.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.067
You just got Smoothed.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.872
We have to tell Bobby Singer
that his season is over?

36:13.905 --> 36:15.874
No. Not we. You.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.046
Hey, Conrad.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.814
Massero doesn't want a resident

36:22.848 --> 36:25.884
telling Bobby the bad news.
He could go off on us.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.586
Massero wouldn't care
if a candy striper

36:27.619 --> 36:30.188
told Bobby the bad news,
as long as it wasn't Massero.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.166
Hey.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.602
I found four new patients
of Lane Hunter.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.103
You're kidding. How?

36:45.136 --> 36:47.205
Social media.
I was able to flag posts

36:47.239 --> 36:48.774
from five new cancer patients

36:48.807 --> 36:50.452
asking for prayers
for their upcoming treatments

36:50.476 --> 36:52.244
at Lane's clinic.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.346
- You're amazing.
- I kind of am.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.847
I'll get contact info
on the patients

36:55.881 --> 36:57.249
and call them saying I'm working

36:57.283 --> 36:59.217
on the cluster story and ask

36:59.251 --> 37:01.353
about their treatment regimen
with their oncologist.

37:01.387 --> 37:04.222
Good, but keep this on the DL.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.358
We don't want
to make anyone suspicious.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.594
Suspicious of Lane?

37:08.627 --> 37:11.196
Should they be?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.131
Devon, you know how much

37:13.164 --> 37:14.533
I respect what you do

37:14.566 --> 37:16.602
for a living.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.437
But if there's a story here,
I'll chase it.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.938
There's no turning back.

37:19.971 --> 37:22.941
You understand?

37:26.945 --> 37:28.880
Go for it.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.492
You will eventually be
working there with me

37:30.516 --> 37:32.451
- in surgery...
- Randolph.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.486
Yeah? Excuse me for a second.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.555
I've spoken with Massero.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.132
According to the Chinese
government, no doctor

37:38.156 --> 37:40.058
below an attending
can assist in the operation.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.627
That means no residents.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.395
Are you okay with that?

37:43.429 --> 37:45.096
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

37:45.130 --> 37:46.131
Good.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.168
Excuse me.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.938
Listen,
we'll pick this up later.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.945
Bobby, you're not
gonna be able to play.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.147
A contusion

38:02.180 --> 38:04.025
from a hardhit ball
while you're on blood thinners

38:04.049 --> 38:07.118
could cause internal bleeding,
and you could die.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.288
So that's it?

38:12.223 --> 38:14.660
It all ends here.

38:14.693 --> 38:17.095
No. No, not necessarily.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.297
It is not unrealistic to think

38:19.331 --> 38:22.200
that you could be back
midseason next year.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.869
But...

38:23.902 --> 38:26.338
I'll be 38.

38:26.372 --> 38:29.341
This was supposed
to be my last season.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.246
Didn't Massero tell you that?

38:37.248 --> 38:38.984
No.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.352
No, he didn't.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.490
All right.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.392
Okay.

38:46.425 --> 38:49.395
All right, so when can I start
having sex again?

38:51.363 --> 38:52.864
Four to five weeks.

38:52.898 --> 38:56.034
And by the way,
somebody wants to see you.

39:01.006 --> 39:04.342
Do you really think women are
turned on by stuff like this?

39:04.376 --> 39:06.011
I mean, come on,
you guys are the ones

39:06.044 --> 39:07.655
who are fascinated
with body parts, not us.

39:07.679 --> 39:11.182
But you know who does
get turned on by them?

39:11.216 --> 39:12.751
Gossip Web sites.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.653
So, if you send
one of these to me

39:14.686 --> 39:16.764
or one of my colleagues again,
I will blast this picture out

39:16.788 --> 39:18.857
with your name on it
to Page Six, TMZ,

39:18.890 --> 39:21.527
The New Yorker, Deadspin... you
see where I'm going with this?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.961
Yeah.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.399
I'm sorry.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.935
Good.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.302
It's a start.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.608
Time for your radiation mapping,

39:36.642 --> 39:38.276
Mr. Phillips.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.145
I'm ready, I guess.

39:42.481 --> 39:44.450
Honey, relax.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.884
I'll be fine.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.454
What could go wrong?

39:57.328 --> 40:00.932
Well, I guess if I get
more time with Mary,

40:00.966 --> 40:03.134
this will all be worth it.

40:03.168 --> 40:07.439
Dr. Hunter says we can increase
his survival time 25%.

40:07.473 --> 40:10.609
What does 25% longer
survival mean?

40:10.642 --> 40:12.277
Months.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.913
It's an estimate based on
patients with similar cancers

40:14.946 --> 40:17.616
using Dr. Hunter's protocol.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.085
She's saying they lived
an additional five weeks.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.587
Five weeks? Stop this thing.

40:21.620 --> 40:25.223
Someone has
to talk to me straight.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.058
You're elected.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.660
Give me a sec, guys.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.163
Dr. Hunter could be talking

40:32.197 --> 40:34.008
about new radiation techniques
that I don't know about.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.903
I'm an internist, but all
treatments and tests have risk.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.905
Chemo and radiation are toxic.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.315
They have to be,
to kill the cancer.

40:41.339 --> 40:44.109
Just tell me if these treatments
will make me die sooner.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.979
They will make you
feel sicker, nauseous,

40:48.013 --> 40:49.815
and will weaken
your immune system

40:49.848 --> 40:52.918
and that means you're more
in danger of getting infections.

40:52.951 --> 40:57.155
And some of those infections
can kill you.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.790
Why didn't anybody
tell us this before?

40:58.824 --> 41:02.628
No one wants
to take away hope, Mary.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.465
What would you do
if you were me?

41:09.501 --> 41:12.103
I wouldn't want to spend
the time I have left

41:12.137 --> 41:13.872
at Dr. Hunter's clinic.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.945
I'd want to spend every minute
I have left with her.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.148
Start the paperwork now.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.350
Discharge me
or I'll walk out of here myself.

41:25.383 --> 41:27.385
Honey, you can't do that.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.454
Can he?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.056
It's a hospital, not a prison.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.399
We can't hold him
against his will.

41:32.423 --> 41:35.894
It's called eloping,

41:35.927 --> 41:39.164
when a patient slips away
without being discharged.

41:43.234 --> 41:46.404
What about this,
chest tube thing?

41:46.437 --> 41:49.541
Well, we changed you
to a portable system

41:49.575 --> 41:52.377
to make it easier for you here.
Mary knows how it works.

41:52.410 --> 41:55.480
It's easy and your dressing
is changed, so...

41:55.513 --> 41:56.848
you're good to go.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.516
We're gonna have
Hospice check on you

41:58.550 --> 41:59.985
when you're settled back home

42:00.018 --> 42:02.721
if you choose to leave now.

42:02.754 --> 42:06.491
Honey, what do you think?

42:06.524 --> 42:09.360
That garage ain't gonna
clean itself.

42:09.394 --> 42:11.563
It's been fun.

42:11.597 --> 42:12.998
Come on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.433
Take that off. -Help
Mr. Phillips back to his room

42:15.466 --> 42:17.535
- and take out his IV, please.
- Easy, easy, easy.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.606
Yeah.

42:27.078 --> 42:28.479
Thank you.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.783
By the way,

42:31.817 --> 42:33.418
you two make a very cute couple.

42:33.451 --> 42:36.021
Hustle, Mary.
In case you missed it,

42:36.054 --> 42:40.225
my end of the hourglass
is very low on sand.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.060
Shut up or I'll leave you
right here.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.005
I slept with Noni.

42:56.074 --> 42:59.544
Well, I haven't slept with Jude.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.880
Maybe I did it to get over you.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.716
That kind of sucks for Noni.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.551
No, she's fine with it.
Believe me.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.320
So, how'd that work out for you.

43:09.354 --> 43:13.191
What do you think?

43:22.968 --> 43:25.270
Dr. Lane Hunter.

43:27.205 --> 43:28.707
What about her?

43:30.676 --> 43:32.678
Tell me everything.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.918
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.388
You've survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:17.422 --> 44:19.691
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:23.194 --> 44:26.531
Every day we encounter people who are
having the worst day of their entire lives.

44:28.566 --> 44:31.169
This is a family.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.138
We work sidebyside.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.340
Hustle up.

44:35.373 --> 44:39.210
You know, I love this job
'cause I get to help people.
