Is it done?

01:10.276 --> 01:12.860
I'll handle it now.

<b> <i>ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BARISHNIKOV@KATCR.CO</i> </b>

03:48.950 --> 03:51.556
Come to daddy.

04:07.436 --> 04:13.596
It must be him.
We gotta find that shit Ciro Di Marzio...

04:13.590 --> 04:18.676
...and each one of his men, before Genny
asks us why his father died and we're still alive.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.956
Go get the bicycles, the big ones.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.396
One for my 9 years old son and
one for my 7 and a half.

04:53.030 --> 04:55.236
Hurry up.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.396
Let's go.

05:11.220 --> 05:14.840
It's been 24 hours now!
- It's alright.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.196
Bullshit!
- I said it's alright!

05:17.196 --> 05:20.716
It's not, I need to know!

05:20.716 --> 05:23.876
What happened to Pietro?

05:23.876 --> 05:28.756
What's important is that you stay calm.

05:29.156 --> 05:34.716
Pietro has been shot,
but he's alright.

05:35.116 --> 05:41.916
Now it's all in my hands and I need your help
to avoid a war.

05:46.076 --> 05:49.596
I wanna see him!
- Not now!

06:03.676 --> 06:07.236
I'll be here when you get out.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.636
What you mean "when you get out"?

06:11.636 --> 06:17.356
I need to talk to my father,
he's nowhere to be found.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.916
Be good.

07:02.730 --> 07:05.196
Let's go.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.756
Guys, have you seen Fernando?

07:37.420 --> 07:39.716
Come here.

07:41.410 --> 07:43.116
Have you seen Fernando?

08:34.155 --> 08:38.770
Ciro Di Marzio disappeared.
- Those shits ran away.

08:38.770 --> 08:42.236
Lello left with his whole family.

08:42.236 --> 08:46.796
Pitbull collected an old debt
and left last night.

08:46.796 --> 08:51.556
Fernando is at his sister's
but he's about to leave.

08:51.556 --> 08:55.756
Guys... we gotta get them right away.

08:57.076 --> 09:01.276
Uncle Fernà, I'm hungry!
- Wait a second.

09:01.276 --> 09:04.036
Where the fuck is it...

09:45.310 --> 09:49.916
I'm gonna kill you and your kids!
Move!

09:55.110 --> 09:56.996
Wait here.

09:57.876 --> 10:00.916
More pasta?
- Ok.

10:03.610 --> 10:06.116
Move.

10:09.556 --> 10:12.836
Careful what you do.

10:15.556 --> 10:17.716
Fernà, run!

10:34.300 --> 10:37.530
You piece of shit!
- Where's your fucking boss?

10:37.530 --> 10:40.740
I don't know,
we split the money and parted ways!

10:40.740 --> 10:43.960
You're gonna get him, I don't care how!
- But how...

10:43.960 --> 10:48.956
How?? I'll throw your whole family
off this roof right now!

10:48.956 --> 10:51.170
You shit!

10:51.170 --> 10:55.356
I'm supposed to bring him a passport.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.350
Good.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.196
Patrì.

11:06.970 --> 11:10.116
What the fuck did you say?

11:10.220 --> 11:12.836
Where do we meet?

11:14.156 --> 11:16.316
Ok.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.476
Get out, Patrì.

12:00.940 --> 12:04.460
I wanna know where my father is.

12:06.340 --> 12:09.220
Is he wounded?

12:11.060 --> 12:14.260
Is he wounded or dead?!

12:14.980 --> 12:17.780
What??

12:19.300 --> 12:23.960
Either he lived or you would've died too.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.300
That's what a good soldier does!

12:29.700 --> 12:32.690
I shouldn't have listened to him.

12:32.690 --> 12:37.740
If he'd let me in the graveyard with him,
he might be still alive.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.520
I would die for my family.

12:41.520 --> 12:47.340
I'll find the bastard who killed him
and blow his head off.

12:50.540 --> 12:53.740
Ciro Di Marzio.

14:48.060 --> 14:56.700
How did Ciro Di Marzio know?
- He got him followed, like he did with Patrizia.

14:57.620 --> 15:03.460
Patrizia was smart enough to know,
while you didn't see shit.

15:03.460 --> 15:07.100
Maybe they were already inside waiting,

15:07.100 --> 15:11.660
'cause someone told 'em you and Pietro had to talk.

15:17.820 --> 15:21.980
You know what they say, Malammore?

15:22.980 --> 15:26.220
The King's deputy can become the King's worst enemy.

15:26.220 --> 15:31.340
They also say the only one not weeping
at the King's funeral is the son.

15:31.340 --> 15:36.300
Because this son is weeping on the inside.

15:39.300 --> 15:43.220
Anyway, the son's in command now.

15:43.220 --> 15:49.460
And the first thing he's gotta do is
tell friends from enemies.

16:51.180 --> 16:55.140
This one.

17:00.580 --> 17:06.500
I got my things ready,
I'll pick everything up after the funeral.

17:10.540 --> 17:14.540
No one's throwing you out.

17:15.900 --> 17:22.380
If you wanna stay, we'll find you a job.
- I wasn't working for the System.

17:24.700 --> 17:28.420
I was with Pietro, that's it.

17:31.020 --> 17:36.740
Do what you want.
- You need to get away from here.

17:36.740 --> 17:41.180
You have a wife and a newborn baby.

17:41.460 --> 17:47.220
This is not a place to live... it's a place to die.

17:55.500 --> 18:00.700
It wasn't Ciro Di Marzio who killed my father.

18:03.700 --> 18:08.500
It was the poison we all have inside.

18:09.020 --> 18:15.260
We know it's there... but we can't spit it out.

18:35.420 --> 18:39.700
What's got into your head?
- I just want peace in your neighborhood.

18:39.700 --> 18:44.580
You lied when you said Don Pietro was fine
and you're lying now.

18:44.580 --> 18:52.060
I've been 30 years with them,
obeying good orders and bad orders.

18:52.060 --> 18:57.080
I bought me a house in hell for them,
by killing a young kid.

18:57.080 --> 19:01.420
I'm sick of that,
I can't be under them anymore.

19:01.420 --> 19:07.580
You're wrong... what happened here
taught us one thing:

19:07.580 --> 19:11.340
You don't touch the Savastanos.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.020
We're ready.

21:14.660 --> 21:20.380
My mother was 16 when I was born.
My father, I never knew him.

21:20.380 --> 21:25.100
I'm a mistake, son of "malammore"*
<i>(*wrong love)</i>

21:25.100 --> 21:29.540
Me and Don Pietro were like brothers
when we were kids.

21:29.540 --> 21:33.900
But then he became a father to me.
He always said:

21:33.900 --> 21:41.340
"No one will give you anything, you gotta take it".
And so we did, together.

21:41.340 --> 21:47.300
Now we gotta start to behave, 
because he's here, watching us!

21:47.300 --> 21:50.700
All the time!

23:27.340 --> 23:32.580
Fernando called,
we need to go.

23:39.060 --> 23:43.100
I know where he is.

23:59.500 --> 24:04.220
Hey, I'll be home tonight.

24:05.260 --> 24:08.980
Kiss the baby for me.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.660
I'll see you later.

24:37.700 --> 24:43.140
The door must be open
but it must look like it's closed, got it?

25:38.260 --> 25:42.860
I must kill that rat myself.

26:20.580 --> 26:25.900
You stay here,
in case those motherfuckers show up.

30:54.550 --> 30:59.660
Where will you go now?
- I don't know.

31:04.380 --> 31:08.340
I also killed my own daughter.

31:10.220 --> 31:15.100
I'm gonna have to pay for that.

31:29.060 --> 31:31.980
Ciro...

33:12.780 --> 33:16.140
Good morning, Don Aniello.
- My condolences, Genny.

33:16.140 --> 33:18.740
Thank you.

33:22.900 --> 33:26.500
Our condolences.

33:29.060 --> 33:32.660
Sorry to disturb you in such a bad time.

33:32.660 --> 33:38.100
He is Elia Capaccio
and this is his brother, Ferdinando.

33:40.300 --> 33:44.520
Do they belong to you, Don Aniello?
- They're my nephews.

33:44.520 --> 33:49.780
And this is Don Eduardo Arenella.
- Nice meeting you.

33:49.780 --> 33:52.900
My pleasure, Don Gennaro.

33:52.900 --> 33:58.740
We called this meeting
'cause we're a bit worried.

33:58.740 --> 34:06.660
With your father dead and you living in Rome,
Secondigliano and Scampia are like a ticking bomb.

34:06.660 --> 34:09.659
It may go off at any moment.

34:09.659 --> 34:13.420
North Naples could fall into anarchy.

34:13.420 --> 34:17.580
Another war would be bad for everyone.

34:17.580 --> 34:22.100
We've always been quiet
in our own house.

34:24.219 --> 34:31.300
Dad always said Sanità and Maddalena
are the richest districts, is that true?

34:31.400 --> 34:34.500
We can't complain.

34:34.500 --> 34:38.659
But he loved the Spanish District and Forcella.

34:38.659 --> 34:43.060
He said only there you could feel the true Naples.

34:43.060 --> 34:46.659
Your father was right.

34:46.760 --> 34:51.020
But the port is the real heart of this city,

34:51.020 --> 34:55.739
it can open us the doors to the whole world.

34:57.380 --> 35:04.700
Now... the war in my house is over
and I'm left in charge.

35:06.220 --> 35:13.540
We never looked into your business, we've always
been respectful... now you gotta do the same.

35:14.980 --> 35:20.260
That's what we wanted to know.
- There's one more thing actually.

35:20.260 --> 35:26.620
The "white"... who'll get it?
- My stuff?

35:26.940 --> 35:33.260
From Rome down, it's just for me and for you, ok?

35:33.580 --> 35:38.140
I'll take your word for it.

35:52.020 --> 35:56.500
Gennà, you're here.
- I'm here.

36:02.460 --> 36:06.420
Daddy's boy...
let's go.

36:07.140 --> 36:11.100
All good?
- Yes.

36:11.300 --> 36:15.620
When do you have to go back?
- Tomorow.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.580
Come.

36:35.140 --> 36:40.420
We're home.
- Why are we here?

36:40.860 --> 36:45.700
You made me a Prince,
I have to treat him like such.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.620
Come on.

37:10.660 --> 37:15.260
Gennà... it's beautiful!

37:17.220 --> 37:20.540
How did you do it?

37:21.900 --> 37:26.540
I met an old friend, Gegè.

37:26.540 --> 37:31.180
He studied in England
but he's from Secondigliano.

37:33.340 --> 37:37.860
He's No.1 for real estate deals.

37:46.060 --> 37:50.260
Is there a little room for Pietro?

37:51.060 --> 37:56.420
He's too little,
he needs to stay by his father.

38:06.300 --> 38:10.500
My brother killed himself in prison.

38:10.500 --> 38:17.060
He'd just recanted the accusations against Don Giuseppe.
- I'm sorry.

38:17.060 --> 38:21.500
Without him, all charges will drop.

38:21.500 --> 38:26.940
Don Giuseppe could already be home if...
- If what?

38:28.100 --> 38:34.500
The judge is not buying the suicide.
- What then?

38:34.500 --> 38:39.180
More investigations.
- He can't hold him this long.

38:39.180 --> 38:43.740
He can hold him with charges
of belonging to a criminal organization.

38:43.740 --> 38:51.100
At least until the Finance Police has finished the inquiry.
- Gennà, can they do it?

38:52.820 --> 38:59.580
Yes, because of the evidence tempering.
- How long will it take?

38:59.690 --> 39:03.660
The lawyer said about one year.

39:07.700 --> 39:13.020
Does Don Giuseppe know about all this?
- Yes.

39:13.220 --> 39:19.900
How did he take it?
- Bad... but he knows he can count on you.

40:38.260 --> 40:42.380
My father didn't leave Naples.

40:45.700 --> 40:49.340
My father is dead.

40:54.740 --> 40:58.900
I had him killed.

41:03.340 --> 41:10.460
He wanted me under him in Secondigliano,
he'd never accepted otherwise.

41:10.460 --> 41:15.420
He was going insane,
 dead people everywhere.

41:17.860 --> 41:21.060
We were in danger ourselves.

41:21.060 --> 41:25.300
I did the only thing I could do:

41:25.300 --> 41:29.180
protect my family.

41:31.140 --> 41:36.100
I paid the price,
as you did yourself.

41:50.780 --> 41:56.740
Now it's just us, Gennà... that's what counts.

42:14.460 --> 42:19.100
