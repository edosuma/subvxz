WEBVTT

00:00.578 --> 00:01.607
I know a lot of us
have been feeling

00:01.696 --> 00:02.881
under the weather lately,

00:03.008 --> 00:04.040
it's that time of year

00:04.176 --> 00:05.676
and according to a study

00:05.776 --> 00:07.391
done by the
University of Arizona,

00:07.464 --> 00:08.841
they discovered that
your keyboards

00:08.992 --> 00:11.111
have hundreds of time
more bacteria

00:11.209 --> 00:12.545
per square inch

00:12.648 --> 00:14.250
Than a toilet seat.
I heard your mama has more bacteria per square inch

00:18.739 --> 00:21.173
Stop.

00:21.241 --> 00:23.182
One of the simplest ways
to cut down

00:23.250 --> 00:24.814
On the spread of germs
is to use something

00:24.881 --> 00:26.092
Called the vampire cough.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.835
Did you say vampire?

00:27.902 --> 00:30.697
Oh, no, it's just that,
if a vampire had to cough,

00:30.765 --> 00:33.510
He would do it like this.

00:33.578 --> 00:34.545
Right,

00:34.612 --> 00:35.714
And ruin their cloaks?

00:35.782 --> 00:37.646
Do you have any idea
how expensive wool is

00:37.714 --> 00:39.640
In Transylvania?
'cause of the euro.

00:39.708 --> 00:41.373
Well, other things you can do

00:41.441 --> 00:42.575
To help cut down
on the spread of disease

00:42.643 --> 00:44.844
Are to wash your hands
regularly,

00:44.912 --> 00:46.713
Don't come in if you're sick,

00:46.780 --> 00:48.714
And get your flu shot.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.319
Also, I'm going to set up
hand-sanitizing stations

00:51.387 --> 00:52.521
Around the office.

00:52.589 --> 00:53.990
No.
No, no.

00:54.058 --> 00:56.426
They will cost you your life.
Elaborate.

00:56.493 --> 00:58.228
The worst thing you can do
for your immune system

00:58.296 --> 00:59.363
Is to coddle it.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.897
They need to fight
their own battles.

01:00.965 --> 01:02.532
If Sabre really cared

01:02.600 --> 01:03.833
About our well-being,

01:03.901 --> 01:06.069
They would set up
hand-desanitizing stations.

01:06.136 --> 01:10.173
A simple bowl at every juncture
filled with dirt, vomit,

01:10.241 --> 01:11.675
Fecal matter.

01:11.742 --> 01:13.243
- I'm not going to do that.
- Exposing yourself to germs

01:13.311 --> 01:15.612
Is the best way
to make yourself stronger.

01:15.679 --> 01:17.446
So by that rationale,
if I had to sneeze,

01:17.513 --> 01:20.147
I should just sneeze on you.

01:20.215 --> 01:21.849
Yes.
I would welcome it.

01:24.019 --> 01:26.087
You're welcome.

01:26.155 --> 01:27.522
The principle is sound.

01:27.590 --> 01:30.294
To avoid illness,
expose yourself to germs,

01:30.362 --> 01:33.331
Enabling your immune system
to develop antibodies.

01:35.134 --> 01:37.968
I don't know
why everyone doesn't do this.

01:38.035 --> 01:42.635
Maybe they have something
against living forever.

Jim.

02:05.053 --> 02:06.553
Pam.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.155
And the precious bundle
of God's best everything.

02:09.222 --> 02:11.623
I wish you both a pleasant day.

02:11.691 --> 02:14.226
And you too.
Yes. Praise God.

02:14.294 --> 02:15.327
Okay.

02:15.395 --> 02:16.495
Cece's getting christened
today.

02:16.563 --> 02:19.464
- Big day.
- Everyone from work is here.

02:19.532 --> 02:20.798
We weren't planning on that.

02:20.866 --> 02:22.099
Nope.

02:22.167 --> 02:23.601
Top o' the Sunday morning
to you.

02:23.668 --> 02:25.102
And a top o' the day
to you too, sir.

02:25.170 --> 02:26.670
I hope you brought your pipes.

02:26.738 --> 02:28.638
We're about to smoke the opium
of the masses.

02:28.706 --> 02:32.075
- Oh, yes,
doobie-doobie-doo.

02:32.143 --> 02:34.743
I invited everyone
in the office

02:34.811 --> 02:37.413
Because it's not a day
for just Jim

02:37.480 --> 02:40.115
Or Pam or the baby or me.

02:40.182 --> 02:42.584
It is about us all.

02:42.651 --> 02:45.686
And I thought
we should all celebrate

02:45.754 --> 02:49.156
My joy and our...
all of our joys.

02:49.224 --> 02:52.793
Ah, man.

02:52.861 --> 02:55.028
Does the nard dog
want nard pups?

02:55.096 --> 02:57.731
Yeah. I want a big old litter
of nard pups,

02:57.798 --> 02:59.632
All jumping around
and sucking on the teat.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.268
Put 'em in a box,
give 'em to my neighbors.

03:02.336 --> 03:03.803
Yeah, I want kids.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.771
For all your paper
and printer needs.

03:05.839 --> 03:10.341
For all your paper
and printer needs.

03:10.409 --> 03:12.343
For all your paper
and printer need

03:12.411 --> 03:14.310
Sunday church service.

03:14.378 --> 03:15.945
It's been a few years.

03:16.013 --> 03:19.548
The big guy and I, we've got
some catching up to do.

03:20.917 --> 03:23.652
Hey. Hey.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.620
I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

03:25.688 --> 03:26.788
Scooch over.

03:26.856 --> 03:28.456
Oh, Michael,
this is just for family.

03:28.524 --> 03:29.991
But I'm the godfather.

03:30.058 --> 03:31.459
It is really funny,
but you know

03:31.526 --> 03:33.060
That can be confusing
at a christening,

03:33.128 --> 03:34.961
Because you are not
the godfather.

03:35.029 --> 03:37.130
Are you talking to me?

03:37.198 --> 03:39.499
- Okay, your turn.
- Scooch,

03:39.566 --> 03:41.167
Before I shoot you in the head.

03:41.235 --> 03:42.968
Okay, Michael, um,

03:43.036 --> 03:45.337
You know I love when you do
that voice,

03:45.405 --> 03:48.473
But today, I'm so sorry,

03:48.541 --> 03:49.907
Need you to tell me
that you know

03:49.975 --> 03:51.308
You're not Cece's godfather.

03:51.376 --> 03:53.377
Yeah.

03:53.444 --> 03:56.012
I'm sorry, Michael.
I need you to say it.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.248
I'm so sorry.

03:59.316 --> 04:00.382
I'm not the godfather.

04:00.450 --> 04:02.051
Okay. Thank you.

04:02.118 --> 04:04.353
So who is the godfather?

04:04.420 --> 04:07.589
Our friend Seth
and his wife there.

04:07.657 --> 04:10.158
Okay.

04:10.225 --> 04:13.160
Old friend, like, you've known
him since kindergarten?

04:13.228 --> 04:15.429
No, I met his wife
in mommy and me.

04:15.497 --> 04:17.096
They're a great couple.
You should meet them later.

04:17.165 --> 04:21.100
No, I have plenty of friends,
so...

04:21.168 --> 04:22.534
All right, well,
you have great seats.

04:22.602 --> 04:23.935
Enjoy the show.
Okay.

04:24.003 --> 04:25.669
Thank you for coming, Michael.

04:25.737 --> 04:26.737
I don't even know
how to say this.

04:26.804 --> 04:29.539
But Cece is turning out

04:29.606 --> 04:32.440
To be a little b-I-t-c-h.

04:32.508 --> 04:33.674
And that's not true,

04:33.742 --> 04:39.447
But her parents are Ki.

04:39.514 --> 04:43.316
â™ª we ask you, lord â™ª

04:43.384 --> 04:47.453
â™ª come to our aid â™ª

04:47.521 --> 04:49.621
Good morning.
Good morning.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.523
- Good morning.
- What a terrific day this is.

04:52.591 --> 04:54.092
And not just because the eagles
are playing.

04:55.861 --> 04:57.294
You may ha see
the bus out front.

04:57.362 --> 05:00.197
Today we also say good-bye
to our young adult ministry.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.765
They're leaving
for three months

05:01.833 --> 05:04.067
To build a school
for the village of Quimixto

05:04.135 --> 05:05.903
In Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.537
I've heard of that place.

05:07.605 --> 05:09.373
If you go to Cabo San Lucas,

05:09.440 --> 05:11.773
All the prostitutes
are from Cabo Corrientes.

05:14.007 --> 05:19.544
Okay, this is...
all right, this is silly.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.581
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope.

05:23.648 --> 05:25.982
And thank you for your prayers

05:26.050 --> 05:27.416
For Justin.

05:27.484 --> 05:28.717
We hope for a speedy recovery.

05:28.784 --> 05:29.817
Thank you.

05:29.885 --> 05:31.452
Anyone else with a prayer

05:31.520 --> 05:33.620
Or a remembrance?

05:37.157 --> 05:39.592
Good morning.
Dwight Schrute.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.761
Thank you all for your prayers

05:41.829 --> 05:43.563
And your remembrances.

05:43.631 --> 05:45.732
Like Justin
and his disfigurement,

05:45.799 --> 05:47.299
I too have had a horrible year.

05:47.367 --> 05:51.870
They say that the middle class
is disappearing,

05:51.938 --> 05:53.905
And, with it,
the soul of America.

05:53.973 --> 05:57.074
, as a gift
to this beautiful congregation,

05:57.142 --> 05:58.776
I would like to offer

05:58.843 --> 06:02.580
A 4% discount on all
Dunder Mifflin Sabre products

06:02.647 --> 06:05.649
If you buy a printer
at full price

06:07.018 --> 06:09.152
Christening calls
to repentance,

06:09.220 --> 06:12.588
To faithfulness,
and to discipleship.

06:12.655 --> 06:14.823
We've come to celebrate
these babies.

06:14.891 --> 06:16.191
Somebody needs a change.

06:16.258 --> 06:17.624
Right now?

06:17.692 --> 06:19.459
Well, she can't bring this up
with her.

06:19.527 --> 06:20.859
Okay.

06:20.927 --> 06:22.928
All right, come on.

06:22.995 --> 06:25.663
Where are we going?
Where are we going

06:25.731 --> 06:27.865
We're gonna take
a little field trip.

06:27.933 --> 06:30.834
Okay. Okay.

06:30.902 --> 06:32.135
There's my girl.

06:32.203 --> 06:35.238
All right.
Hold on one second.

06:35.306 --> 06:36.672
There we go.

06:36.740 --> 06:39.675
What's that face for?

06:39.743 --> 06:41.076
Oh, my...
oh, my God.

06:41.144 --> 06:43.778
Cece, no.
No, no, no... not on the dress.

06:43.846 --> 06:44.946
Cece, stop.

06:57.189 --> 06:58.455
- What?
- What?

06:58.523 --> 07:00.857
- Honey, no.
- Yes.

07:00.925 --> 07:02.425
No, no.

07:02.493 --> 07:04.160
This is happening.

07:04.228 --> 07:05.862
We have an extra outfit
in the bag.

07:05.929 --> 07:07.596
No. There's
no extra outfit in the bag.

07:07.664 --> 07:11.066
- You said you checked it.
- I did...Say that.

07:11.134 --> 07:13.569
At this time, will the
families please come join me?

07:13.637 --> 07:16.172
Jim and Pam
and Cece really seem

07:16.240 --> 07:17.206
To be clicking.

07:17.274 --> 07:18.808
They are totally gelling.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.210
It's as if they leave my office
and they go to another office

07:21.277 --> 07:23.344
That sells happiness.

07:23.412 --> 07:24.912
And good for them.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.681
That's great,
because, you know,

07:27.749 --> 07:32.018
The paper industry's
not gonna last forever.

07:33.254 --> 07:34.387
Before we go,

07:34.455 --> 07:35.755
I'd like to remind everyone

07:35.823 --> 07:36.956
That the "halberts"
have been kind enough

07:37.024 --> 07:38.290
To host a reception next door

07:38.358 --> 07:39.791
Immediately
following the service.

07:39.859 --> 07:43.861
Mm. No.
Wrong both counts.

07:43.929 --> 07:47.064
Okay, 'a, ' "halbert"?

07:47.132 --> 07:50.800
And, 'b, ' I think a more
appropriate statement would be,

07:50.868 --> 07:53.936
"the halberts are hosting
an intimate reception

07:54.004 --> 07:55.671
For their invited guests."

07:57.007 --> 07:58.907
For all their generosity
of spirit,

07:58.975 --> 08:00.976
They password-protect
their wireless?

08:01.043 --> 08:02.210
Try Jesus.

08:02.278 --> 08:03.645
<i>Opus Dei.</i>

08:03.712 --> 08:05.646
Hi.
Good morning.

08:05.714 --> 08:08.916
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:08.984 --> 08:10.785
- Good morning.
- Hello.

08:15.124 --> 08:16.257
How are you?

08:16.325 --> 08:17.325
Good morning.

08:17.393 --> 08:18.726
Good morning.
Good morning.

08:18.793 --> 08:20.127
I am feeling this.

08:20.194 --> 08:22.628
Call it the Holy spirit
or the passion of the Christ.

08:22.696 --> 08:24.697
I am loving these people.

08:28.629 --> 08:30.096
- Hi.
- Thanks for having us.

08:30.164 --> 08:31.263
I'm Doug McPherson,
Davey's Uncle.

08:31.331 --> 08:33.865
Oh, well,
Dave is an adorable baby.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.100
Davey.

08:35.167 --> 08:37.635
Yeah.

08:37.703 --> 08:38.702
Wow.

08:38.770 --> 08:40.770
Well, this is intimate.

08:40.839 --> 08:42.306
We just had to add
a few more tables.

08:42.373 --> 08:43.940
We weren't expecting
this many people.

08:44.008 --> 08:45.441
You don't know them all?

08:45.509 --> 08:47.109
Nope, and we're gonna need

08:47.177 --> 08:48.978
A loaves and fishes
kind of miracle

08:49.045 --> 08:50.279
To feed 'em all.

08:50.347 --> 08:53.748
Jesus is not your caterer.

08:53.816 --> 08:55.650
But he should be your caterer,
'cause you're a little angel.

08:55.717 --> 08:58.953
Why didn't your parents get you
a caterer?

08:59.021 --> 09:00.120
They don't think.

09:00.221 --> 09:02.289
Hmm.
Don't listen to her.

09:02.357 --> 09:04.591
She's just jealous 'cause
she doesn't get to come home

09:04.659 --> 09:06.426
To someone as cute as you.

09:06.494 --> 09:08.094
Huh, you think she is jealous
about having a baby?

09:08.162 --> 09:09.695
I don't know.
I'm just hungry.

09:09.763 --> 09:12.398
Okay, well, you know what,
everybody's hungry.

09:12.465 --> 09:14.800
Sorry.
I think I'm just hungry.

09:16.135 --> 09:17.936
Oh, after you.

09:18.004 --> 09:20.538
- Oh, no, after you.
- No, I insist. After me.

09:20.606 --> 09:22.540
I'm gonna use that one.

09:22.608 --> 09:24.108
Have a good lunch.
Thank you. You too.

09:24.175 --> 09:26.676
This is not the meal
I was promised.

09:26.744 --> 09:29.478
I'm going to have no energy
for the rest of the day.

09:29.546 --> 09:31.247
I canceled my plans to come

09:31.314 --> 09:33.648
To this thing,
and they repay me with this?

09:33.716 --> 09:34.782
You know what, guys,

09:34.850 --> 09:36.317
Let's just enjoy lunch.

09:36.418 --> 09:38.485
With what?
How?

09:38.552 --> 09:40.486
Sometimes, Michael.

09:40.554 --> 09:42.320
Sometimes.

09:42.388 --> 09:43.555
Excuse me, everyone,

09:43.623 --> 09:44.789
On behalf of the youth ministry

09:44.857 --> 09:46.591
That's leaving for Mexico,

09:46.659 --> 09:48.293
I just wanted
to thank our hosts

09:48.361 --> 09:50.462
And tell you
about those good-looking guys

09:50.529 --> 09:52.263
And gals over there.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.703
Teach for America girls
are way hotter,

09:56.770 --> 09:58.238
But they're nuts.

09:58.305 --> 10:00.973
This is Jessica Ortega.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.675
I met her when both she and I
were both seven years old

10:03.743 --> 10:06.878
When my parents took me
to Quimixto on a service trip.

10:06.945 --> 10:09.080
Who takes a kid to Mexico?

10:09.148 --> 10:11.982
I would run to Mexico if
that's where the sandwiches are.

10:12.050 --> 10:14.417
- Shh.
- Right now, Jessica's children

10:14.485 --> 10:17.353
Have to walk 12 miles
to a school with dirt floors.

10:17.421 --> 10:18.854
No.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.356
It's gonna be three months
of hard work,

10:20.423 --> 10:24.526
And when we're done, we'll
practically be Quimixtanos.

10:24.594 --> 10:26.828
Greg, hello, it's Dwight
from the vestibule.

10:26.896 --> 10:28.996
You want to know
my 11th commandment?

10:29.064 --> 10:31.164
I will not be undersold.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.165
Hey, Dwight.
Dwight, hey.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.201
I am ready to love thy neighbor

10:34.269 --> 10:35.536
With these kind of discounts.
Are you kidding me?

10:35.603 --> 10:37.437
Stop it.
I'll call you back.

10:37.505 --> 10:40.107
My parents explained it
to me this way.

10:40.175 --> 10:42.009
You wouldn't hesitate to save
a family member

10:42.077 --> 10:43.543
From a burning building,

10:43.611 --> 10:45.977
But what if the earth
was your building

10:46.045 --> 10:48.513
And all the people on it
were your family?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.181
What if the moon was your car

10:50.249 --> 10:52.183
And Jupiter
was your hair brush?

10:52.251 --> 10:53.584
- Shh.
- Thank you.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.619
<i>Or should I say gracias?</i>

11:04.529 --> 11:07.031
Cece went down.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.800
What was this?
You're out of it.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.669
- Scones.
- I didn't get one.

11:11.736 --> 11:12.903
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

11:12.971 --> 11:14.471
I didn't get one either.

11:14.539 --> 11:17.774
Is it just the one jug
of apple cider?

11:20.879 --> 11:21.912
Who the heck was that?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.547
I think that was sconesy cider,

11:23.615 --> 11:27.351
Noted baptism reception critic.

11:27.418 --> 11:28.818
We need more food.

11:28.886 --> 11:31.587
I'll go get some subs and sodas.
All right.

11:31.655 --> 11:34.323
And cider.

11:35.592 --> 11:36.959
Look at that.
Look at that.

11:37.027 --> 11:37.994
That's fun.

11:38.061 --> 11:39.829
We need to do stuff together

11:39.896 --> 11:41.597
Outside of work.

11:41.665 --> 11:44.466
Let's go help Africa.

11:44.534 --> 11:45.768
Let's go build an airport.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.903
We'll start small.
We'll have a carwash.

11:47.971 --> 11:50.272
We'll send some cheerleaders
to regionals.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.507
You could feed the hungry.
Us.

11:52.575 --> 11:54.176
Why do we have
to do something together?

11:54.243 --> 11:55.977
I volunteer at a clinic
on my own time.

11:56.045 --> 11:57.278
- Yeah, well,
that's just a pick-up scene.

11:57.346 --> 11:58.945
Okay, we don't have
to volunteer.

11:59.046 --> 12:01.180
But I think we should hang out
more together.

12:01.248 --> 12:03.982
We are hanging out...
right now.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.383
You want some more of this?

12:05.451 --> 12:06.484
Look at these people.

12:06.552 --> 12:08.152
These are church-going people.

12:08.220 --> 12:11.054
And they know how to party.

12:11.122 --> 12:12.422
Church isn't a party, Michael.

12:12.490 --> 12:13.890
- Well, it's... it's...
- welcome to the party.

12:13.957 --> 12:15.858
Everybody have their kool-aid?

12:15.926 --> 12:17.359
No.
Okay, you know what?

12:17.427 --> 12:19.161
This is inappropriate.
What is wrong with you guys?

12:19.229 --> 12:20.462
What is wrong with you?

12:20.529 --> 12:22.663
What is so horrible
about wanting to get together

12:22.731 --> 12:23.697
And do something nice?

12:23.765 --> 12:25.665
Why did you guys
even come today?

12:25.733 --> 12:27.200
What's so great about your lives
that you think

12:27.268 --> 12:28.434
You're better
than everybody else?

12:28.502 --> 12:30.435
That you can make fun
of everybody else?

12:30.503 --> 12:32.371
You're mean.
You're mean girls.

12:32.439 --> 12:35.073
<i>Like the movie mean girls.</i>

12:35.141 --> 12:37.743
And Kevin and Stanley,

12:37.811 --> 12:41.412
If you don't stop worrying so
much about what you're gonna put

12:41.480 --> 12:45.349
In your gullet, you're gonna die
in about a month.

12:47.952 --> 12:49.886
Oh, hey, meemaw,

12:49.953 --> 12:51.421
Would you watch Cece
for a second?

12:51.488 --> 12:52.955
Don't worry.
She's asleep.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.657
I'm just gonna track down
some more chairs.

12:54.724 --> 12:56.392
Fine, fine.

12:56.459 --> 12:59.861
<i>I guess I'll watch Suzanne's
purse and your baby.</i>

13:15.276 --> 13:17.043
Bye.
Good luck.

13:17.110 --> 13:20.212
Good luck to you.
Bye.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.081
Do good.
Do good.

13:22.148 --> 13:23.449
Bye. Have fun.

13:23.517 --> 13:26.252
We're proud of you.

13:34.761 --> 13:36.862
Bye.

13:36.930 --> 13:37.930
Okay.

13:37.997 --> 13:41.599
Hey. Hey.
Is this the bus to Mexico?

13:41.666 --> 13:43.467
Yeah!

13:43.534 --> 13:45.668
- I'll take a shirt.
- Are you coming?

13:45.735 --> 13:47.836
- If you'll have me, yes.
- Heck, yes.

13:47.904 --> 13:50.572
Really?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.574
Thank you.
All right.

13:55.262 --> 13:56.861
Michael?
Get off the bus.

13:56.929 --> 13:58.463
No, I'm not.
I'm staying on the bus.

13:58.531 --> 14:00.032
I'm already on the bus.
I'm going.

14:00.099 --> 14:01.767
Michael, this is irresponsible.

14:01.835 --> 14:03.268
It is not irresponsible!

14:03.336 --> 14:04.937
I have never
been more confident

14:05.004 --> 14:06.872
About a decision in my life.

14:06.939 --> 14:08.673
I agree.
I think it's superb.

14:08.741 --> 14:10.075
Well, you have a job to do.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.344
Okay, there is no off-season
when it comes to printer sales.

14:12.411 --> 14:14.946
You know what, my job
will be here when I get back.

14:15.014 --> 14:16.147
Michael, you can't
go to Mexico.

14:16.215 --> 14:17.750
You don't have your passport.

14:17.817 --> 14:19.151
You don't need one to get in.

14:19.218 --> 14:21.918
Plus, we can just have it
sent to him down in Mexico.

14:21.985 --> 14:22.918
Hey, right?

14:22.985 --> 14:24.118
Michael, what am I supposed

14:24.185 --> 14:25.753
To tell my clients
if they ask about you?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.088
Tell them that I died

14:27.156 --> 14:28.822
And I turned into an angel,

14:28.890 --> 14:30.991
And, when they feel a breeze

14:31.059 --> 14:33.693
In a room
with all the windows closed

14:33.761 --> 14:36.996
Or that... that chill
on the back of their neck,

14:37.064 --> 14:39.598
That is just me
watching over them.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.966
Okay, but what about
the bigger corporate accounts?

14:42.034 --> 14:43.134
Tell them
that I'm in a meeting.

14:43.201 --> 14:44.868
Michael, I am just
about to close a sale.

14:44.936 --> 14:46.536
Can I authorize a 15% discount?

14:46.603 --> 14:48.104
- No, you may not.
- Gah!

14:48.172 --> 14:49.439
I think it's really cool,
Michael.

14:49.507 --> 14:51.675
I wish I had a job
that I could just leave.

14:51.742 --> 14:53.043
Thank you.

14:56.713 --> 14:58.914
Save me an aisle seat,
Michael! I'm coming!

14:58.982 --> 15:00.482
I will not stand idly by

15:00.549 --> 15:02.650
While these Mexican villagers
are sick.

15:02.718 --> 15:04.552
We're actually building 'em
a school.

15:04.619 --> 15:05.719
Whatever.

15:05.787 --> 15:08.522
I won't...
I won't stand for it.

15:11.593 --> 15:13.994
See you in a few months.

15:15.763 --> 15:17.964
If the whole world
were like you guys,

15:18.032 --> 15:19.766
We wouldn't have
so many problems.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.334
Mm.
That's not gonna happen.

15:21.402 --> 15:23.168
We're one in a million.

15:23.236 --> 15:24.336
I know.

15:24.403 --> 15:25.903
Nobody I know
would leave their jobs

15:25.971 --> 15:27.238
And friends and families

15:27.306 --> 15:29.339
To do manual labor
for three months.

15:29.407 --> 15:32.975
Well, you know what, everybody
thinks that I am crazy,

15:33.043 --> 15:36.311
And that tells me that I am
the sanest person I know.

15:36.379 --> 15:39.149
So...

15:39.217 --> 15:41.484
Just a heads up. Probably
gonna be borrowing a few things.

15:41.552 --> 15:44.420
Gonna need a contact lens case,

15:44.488 --> 15:47.089
Some sunscreen, some sandals...

15:52.761 --> 15:56.263
Why you always got to be
so mean to me?

15:59.433 --> 16:03.602
Uh, meemaw, where's Cece?

16:03.670 --> 16:06.271
I don't know.
I lost the purse too.

16:08.007 --> 16:09.506
Okay.

16:09.574 --> 16:12.609
- Good-bye, Lackawanna county.

16:12.677 --> 16:15.011
How long till we get to Mexico?

16:15.079 --> 16:17.681
Well, two days minus how long
we've been on the road.

16:17.748 --> 16:19.115
45 minutes?

16:19.183 --> 16:21.384
So, like, two days basically.

16:21.451 --> 16:22.684
Maybe more.
Ooh.

16:22.752 --> 16:24.085
What are we building
down there again?

16:24.153 --> 16:25.854
Like, a hospital?

16:25.922 --> 16:27.422
A school for Mexicans?
What?

16:27.490 --> 16:29.724
I don't know, I thought
it was like a gymnasium or...

16:29.792 --> 16:31.792
Why aren't they building it
themselves?

16:31.860 --> 16:33.261
They don't know how.

16:33.328 --> 16:34.561
Do we know how?
I don't know how.

16:34.629 --> 16:37.231
- Well, Carla knows.
- You know how?

16:37.298 --> 16:39.732
Carla knows.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.802
Oh, I feel like there were
so many more people on this bus.

16:42.870 --> 16:46.772
There were, like,
200, 300 people before.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.875
Hey, Carla?

16:49.943 --> 16:51.777
Carla?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.712
Hi.
What are you doing?

16:53.779 --> 16:55.647
Oh, trying to sleep.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.286
What is happening?

17:02.353 --> 17:07.321
Oh, God, what is happening?

17:07.390 --> 17:11.992
Do you smell
like a weird, warm cheese?

17:12.060 --> 17:14.161
Oh, God, you know what?

17:14.229 --> 17:16.796
I am gonna be in Mexico
for my half-birthday.

17:16.864 --> 17:18.763
- And the Christmas party.
- And cinco De Mayo.

17:18.832 --> 17:20.732
Nah. No, we'll be back
before that.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.768
No, we...
you know how these things go.

17:23.836 --> 17:26.438
Construction projects,
they say three months,

17:26.506 --> 17:27.607
And then, after two years,

17:27.674 --> 17:30.010
The lazy bums
haven't even started.

17:30.077 --> 17:33.645
Now we're those lazy bums.

17:33.713 --> 17:37.648
I gotta get off this bus.

17:37.716 --> 17:38.749
Hey, guys,

17:38.817 --> 17:39.984
Has anybody seen the baby?

17:40.052 --> 17:42.686
Here's her carrier,
but no Cece.

17:42.754 --> 17:45.022
Jim, Jim, I want
to give a toast.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.190
Where's the little girl
of honor?

17:46.257 --> 17:47.257
I don't know, dad.
I don't know.

17:47.325 --> 17:48.491
I don't mean to bug,

17:48.559 --> 17:49.725
But do you know when those subs
are due into port?

17:49.793 --> 17:50.993
I got a hungry bunch
of McPhersons over there.

17:51.061 --> 17:53.595
I don't know.
Hey, have you seen my baby?

17:53.663 --> 17:55.163
I think maybe some blonde lady
had her.

17:55.231 --> 17:56.164
A small blonde woman?

17:56.232 --> 17:58.032
- Smaller than me.
- Everyone.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.266
Everyone, can I just have
your attention?

17:59.334 --> 18:01.001
Has anyone seen a small...

18:01.069 --> 18:02.168
Stop that tiny, blonde woman!

18:02.236 --> 18:04.437
She stole my baby!

18:04.504 --> 18:06.172
What are you doing?

18:06.239 --> 18:08.773
- Give me that baby.
- What? Kevin!

18:08.841 --> 18:12.542
Hi, honey.
I was just changing the baby.

18:12.610 --> 18:14.410
- Hi.
- Honey.

18:14.477 --> 18:15.510
Hi.
All right.

18:15.578 --> 18:17.478
Travel safe, Angela.

18:17.546 --> 18:19.380
Did you think I stole
your baby?

18:19.448 --> 18:21.350
What's that?

18:21.418 --> 18:22.786
Oh, yeah, back then I did.

18:22.854 --> 18:24.054
Just now.

18:24.122 --> 18:26.790
So don't,
because I've got my eye on you.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.793
Look at these scones, Jim.

18:30.861 --> 18:31.961
Thousands of them.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.864
What kind of a person
steals scones

18:34.932 --> 18:36.532
From a baby?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.900
Someone put them in my bag.

18:38.968 --> 18:40.835
So that was lunch, eh?

18:40.903 --> 18:43.404
McPherson troop,
let's haul out.

18:43.472 --> 18:46.240
Rendezvous at friendly's.

18:46.308 --> 18:47.808
Did you lose Cece?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.309
Yeah.

18:49.377 --> 18:52.278
Yeah, a little bit.
I did.

18:52.345 --> 18:54.746
Can you fake a seizure
or a heart attack or something?

18:54.814 --> 18:56.381
I can make myself cry.

18:56.449 --> 18:57.549
Do that.
Do it.

18:57.616 --> 19:00.418
Should I... I got it.
I got it.

19:00.485 --> 19:04.555
Um, hey, I saw a sign
for a scenic overlook coming up.

19:04.623 --> 19:06.056
Really love
to check out the view.

19:06.124 --> 19:07.624
Can't stop.
We're on a schedule.

19:07.691 --> 19:10.692
Well, there's a nice bistro
coming up.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.560
We could pick up some Paninis
for the road.

19:12.628 --> 19:13.895
Maybe we'll stop in Tennessee.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.696
It's not safe
to talk to a driver.

19:15.764 --> 19:19.298
Okay, driver, driver, if
you're not gonna stop this bus,

19:19.366 --> 19:21.367
Then I'm going to stop it
for you.

19:21.434 --> 19:23.736
Okay?
Hang on.

19:26.639 --> 19:28.106
Stopping in Tennessee.

19:28.174 --> 19:30.408
Hey, is there a problem,
you guys?

19:30.475 --> 19:32.542
Yeah, just get him
to stop the bus, please.

19:32.610 --> 19:34.777
- Why?
- Just make him stop

19:34.845 --> 19:36.612
The freaking bus!
Stop the bus, okay?

19:36.680 --> 19:37.680
Are you okay, sir?

19:37.747 --> 19:38.914
I didn't sign up for this.

19:38.982 --> 19:41.683
You guys are young,
that's great.

19:41.751 --> 19:43.584
You want to give back
to society.

19:43.652 --> 19:45.019
I've done that.

19:45.087 --> 19:46.420
I need to take.

19:46.488 --> 19:48.088
You have plenty left to give.

19:48.156 --> 19:49.356
You're doing...
- blah-Di-blah!

19:49.424 --> 19:50.424
It doesn't matter.

19:50.491 --> 19:51.391
We could go back and forth
all day.

19:51.459 --> 19:53.193
It's not gonna solve anything.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.527
If we went to Mexico,

19:54.594 --> 19:55.928
We'd probably screw
everything up anyway.

19:55.996 --> 19:57.029
Do you want that
for little Jessica?

19:57.097 --> 19:58.430
No, you don't.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.764
And the answer is clear.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.632
Stop the bus. Okay?
Stop the bus!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.567
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus!

20:06.872 --> 20:08.972
Okay, stop the dang bus.

20:09.040 --> 20:13.109
Okay, well, a pleasure.

20:13.177 --> 20:14.677
Go save the world.

20:14.744 --> 20:17.579
We'll keep an eye on America
for you.

20:22.618 --> 20:23.918
Wait for me!

20:29.757 --> 20:32.158
Don't say anything
to my parents.

20:44.402 --> 20:45.369
Get in quick.

20:45.436 --> 20:47.304
- Why quick?
- So it's faster.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.773
Do you guys want me
to take you home

20:50.841 --> 20:52.075
Or go back to the church?

20:52.142 --> 20:53.342
Is anyone still at the church?

20:53.343 --> 20:55.851
No. Actually, most of them
went to go see a movie.

20:56.643 --> 20:57.355
What?

20:57.434 --> 20:58.482
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

20:58.618 --> 21:01.426
Kevin suggested it,
and then *****

21:01.650 --> 21:04.609
It is so nice to be back
in a country that has movies.

21:04.825 --> 21:07.529
- I bet, you guys...
- Can I come?

21:10.697 --> 21:12.227
Lake****gun is on.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.153
- Do you guys ** with that?
- Banana bread, but,

21:15.339 --> 21:19.979
Fred Northquest had no appetite, he was
thinking about his par of new boots.

21:20.130 --> 21:21.883
And ten years after all,

21:22.003 --> 21:23.498
as he told Mrs. Northquest

21:23.643 --> 21:25.635
it would take two years to get

21:25.730 --> 21:27.435
comfortable with the new boots.
