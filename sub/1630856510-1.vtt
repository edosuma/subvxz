WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:01.760
Standby.

00:01.760 --> 00:03.000
Firing.

00:03.000 --> 00:03.960
(explosion booms)

00:03.960 --> 00:05.800
They know callout times, how we think,

00:05.800 --> 00:07.240
how we move, everything.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.000
It's got to be an inside man.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.640
(explosion booms)

00:10.640 --> 00:12.520
[Officer] We have eyewitness reports

00:12.520 --> 00:14.560
of John Hudson fleeing the scene.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.200
John never made me
feel part of the team.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.840
Always making a snide
comment about Muslims.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.280
Have you, erm, heard
any more about John?

00:21.280 --> 00:23.320
We didn't find anything
on him, he's clean.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.640
When you're away from the
job, is it hard to switch off?

00:26.640 --> 00:31.440
Yeah, it can be, which can
be difficult for my partner.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.160
I was with someone else.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.000
You telling me it's over between us?

00:35.000 --> 00:35.840
[Lana] I don't know.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.000
Know us, like, I
don't really do talking,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.640
but if you wanted to, I'm right here.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.680
You know I, I really think we've got

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
loads of stuff in common.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.960
[MP] It's a privilege to
have been elected as your MP.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.160
[Karl] Mind if I have a word?

00:49.160 --> 00:51.120
Surprisingly easy to
hide something in here.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.680
Central Eight Five, we have
a critical ongoing situation.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.880
Possible IED.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.840
Right, so Karl, come on.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.320
What about us?

00:58.320 --> 00:59.560
Were you using me?

00:59.560 --> 01:00.400
I'm sorry, Lana.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.560
Please.

01:01.560 --> 01:02.520
(people gasp and scream)

01:02.520 --> 01:03.720
(gun fires)

01:03.720 --> 01:07.880
My job is to keep people safe
and I haven't been able to.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.880
There was a gentleman called Ali Hussein.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.680
Help me!

01:11.680 --> 01:13.640
Just stay really, really still, okay?

01:13.640 --> 01:16.040
Just couldn't get to the device in time.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.400
(explosion booms)
(people scream)

01:18.400 --> 01:19.600
My brother.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.720
We believe your brother is involved

01:21.720 --> 01:23.040
with the crusader cell.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.720
I'm sorry, sir, are you
sure you mean my Billy?

01:25.720 --> 01:27.320
The timer, it means nothing.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.480
They've put it there as a trick.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.000
Listen to me, I'm your sister.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.840
Lana!

01:30.840 --> 01:32.400
[Officer] Suspect is unlocking door.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.120
(explosion booms)
(Lana screams)

01:34.120 --> 01:38.160
And, erm, Nut, number one, my friend.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.040
Have you got my snips, mate?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.080
[Lana] Yeah, coming.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.400
(explosion booms)

01:42.400 --> 01:45.840
And how does it feel
carrying that responsibility?

01:45.840 --> 01:48.000
[Lana] I'm scared that next
time I step up to a device,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.920
I'm not gonna know what I'm doing.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.280
(tense music)

01:56.280 --> 01:59.000
(siren wailing)

02:25.240 --> 02:28.920
(people chattering faintly)

02:36.280 --> 02:38.280
Well, look who it is.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.400
Sorry, do I know you?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.560
I'm looking for a highly
trained top professional

02:43.560 --> 02:45.280
called Danny.
- All right.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.440
Not some donut that's
getting married next week.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.360
That's in two weeks and three days.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.960
If you've even bothered
to read your invite.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.440
Of course I did.

02:52.440 --> 02:56.320
Congratulations, I'm really happy for you.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.600
You not been home yet?

02:57.600 --> 03:00.560
No, straight from the
airport, the plane was delayed.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.600
It's called being a professional.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.240
Oh! It's good to have you back.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, it's good to be back.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.320
Six months without your
ugly mug, it was too long.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.400
[Danny] Ooh!

03:12.600 --> 03:16.320
(workers chattering faintly)

03:29.000 --> 03:31.720
(crowd applauds)

03:36.360 --> 03:37.280
Thank you.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.080
My name's Lana Washington,
I'm an explosives officer,

03:40.080 --> 03:42.240
otherwise known as EXPO at the Met.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.840
For most people, being
face to face with a bomb

03:44.840 --> 03:48.160
is their worst nightmare,
making speeches is mine.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.080
(crowd chuckles)

03:49.080 --> 03:51.120
I've spent the last few
months making the same joke

03:51.120 --> 03:54.120
to Ukrainian EXPOs I've
been training in Estonia.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.680
They didn't find it funny either.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.280
(crowd laughs)

03:57.280 --> 04:01.040
EXPOs have a saying, "Be alert
to the absence of the normal

04:01.040 --> 04:03.720
and the presence of the abnormal."

04:03.720 --> 04:06.240
In Afghanistan, we could always
spot the high possibility

04:06.240 --> 04:07.240
of an IED.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.600
There were no children out
playing on the streets,

04:09.600 --> 04:11.880
no locals going about
their usual business.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.920
It's a little trickier to spot here.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.040
(machines whirring)
(computer beeping)

04:15.040 --> 04:17.600
(tense music)

04:33.400 --> 04:36.400
(Joe breathes heavily)

04:36.400 --> 04:39.800
(computer alarm blares)

04:41.480 --> 04:44.640
Here are some examples of
improvised explosive devices.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.000
There are three main types of IED.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.320
Time, command, and victim.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.680
Time is dependent upon a time switch,

04:51.680 --> 04:55.240
command means somebody else
is in control of the device,

04:55.240 --> 04:57.920
and victim is your classic booby trap.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.800
The moment you realise it's there

04:59.800 --> 05:01.560
is the moment it kills you.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.920
Now, all the devices you see here

05:03.920 --> 05:06.680
are not from the
battlefields of Afghanistan,

05:06.680 --> 05:08.400
they're not from the streets of Baghdad,

05:08.400 --> 05:10.920
they're not historic relics from Belfast.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.480
All these IEDs were found and
neutralised here in London.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.560
(machines whirring)

05:18.600 --> 05:22.240
(suspenseful music)

05:22.240 --> 05:24.360
The Met is under a
constant state of alert.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.240
We need to adapt to new threats,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.160
new techniques, new enemies.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.880
(drone propellers whirring)

05:33.360 --> 05:37.200
(suspenseful music continues)

05:49.560 --> 05:52.560
[Worker] Oi! Got your coffee here.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.200
(drone propellers whirring)

05:59.200 --> 06:02.680
(electricity fizzles)

06:02.680 --> 06:05.680
(machine rumbling)

06:07.640 --> 06:09.240
Danger is all around,

06:09.240 --> 06:11.520
often from the most unlikely sources.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.840
(explosion rumbling)

06:13.840 --> 06:16.680
We have to be on our guard at all times.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.040
(crowd murmuring)

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
(explosion booms)

06:20.040 --> 06:22.640
(crowd gasps)

06:23.760 --> 06:26.440
(woman screams)

06:28.920 --> 06:31.920
(explosion rumbles)

06:31.920 --> 06:34.760
(dramatic music)

06:38.240 --> 06:40.720
(sirens wailing)

06:40.720 --> 06:41.560
(people chattering)

06:41.560 --> 06:43.000
[Woman] Please make your way to the exit

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
in an orderly fashion.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.440
Wash, we're getting
reports in of an incident

06:45.440 --> 06:47.320
at the Isle of Dogs power station.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.640
Some kind of explosion.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.800
Yeah, we saw it.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.760
Well, first response
have seen some wires

06:51.760 --> 06:52.960
on the entrance gate, possibly an IED.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.560
Look, we're leaving
now, ETA is 30 minutes.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.400
You're closer, right?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.640
What, do you want me to take it?

06:58.640 --> 07:00.160
Look, I know you're not officially

07:00.160 --> 07:01.320
back on duty until tomorrow,

07:01.320 --> 07:02.720
but if you could hold the fort, then-

07:02.720 --> 07:04.400
Hass, come on.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.240
(siren wailing)

07:05.240 --> 07:06.920
Are you okay with that?

07:06.920 --> 07:09.480
Er, yeah, sure, no problem.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.560
I'll see you in a bit.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.080
(people chattering)

07:14.080 --> 07:16.560
(faint radio chatter)

07:16.560 --> 07:19.200
(radio bleeps)

07:23.040 --> 07:24.000
You set?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.080
Yeah.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.360
(sirens wailing)

07:27.360 --> 07:30.440
(suspenseful music)

07:44.320 --> 07:47.080
(fire crackling)

07:50.960 --> 07:52.760
[Shaun] Get the LPPs in position.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.880
We need to move fast
once the gate's clear.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.080
[Fireman] Yes, Chief.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.640
Lana Washington, bomb disposal.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.680
Shaun Hodge, station commander.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.200
Where is the suspect device?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.680
It's on the gate.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.800
It's the only way through
to get to the fire.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.000
Is there anyone inside?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.800
Shift workers.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.880
We're worried that the fire
could spread to the transformer

08:09.880 --> 08:12.320
on the far side and cause
that to explode too.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.120
We can't get to either
until you clear the gate.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.240
Any word on Hass?

08:21.240 --> 08:23.520
No, not yet.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.600
Shall we get you kitted up?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.880
(suspenseful music continues)

08:34.320 --> 08:35.680
I'm sure this has got heavier.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.560
Been here before, haven't we, boss?

08:37.560 --> 08:39.880
(Lana chuckles)

08:39.880 --> 08:43.640
(suspenseful music softens)

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
Okay?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.880
(radio bleeps)

09:03.080 --> 09:05.400
(siren wailing)

09:05.400 --> 09:08.600
(footsteps pounding)

09:12.760 --> 09:14.600
[Lana] Everyone back!

09:14.600 --> 09:17.520
[Officer] We need to clear this.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.800
(Lana breathes heavily)

09:27.640 --> 09:31.480
(suspenseful music continues)

09:41.840 --> 09:43.840
[Danny] What have we got, boss?

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
[Lana] Looks like a trigger wire.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.680
It bridges both sides of the gate.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.640
I need to get a better look.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.560
(suspenseful music intensifies)

10:33.640 --> 10:35.640
IED confirmed.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.680
Shit.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.760
[Danny] Boss, you okay?

10:55.880 --> 10:58.560
We've two devices,
they seem to be linked.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.680
The whole gate is set to blow.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.720
(tense music)

11:12.520 --> 11:13.320
(radio bleeps)

11:13.320 --> 11:14.975
(faint radio chatter)

11:14.975 --> 11:16.480
[Thom] Okay, what's the status?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.200
[Danny] Here we go.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.040
Easy does it.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.120
[Lana] Ah.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.600
So, can we go in?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.960
Afraid not, we've got two devices.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.520
They're both hidden
behind the warning signs.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.360
It looks like they're set
to blow simultaneously

11:31.360 --> 11:33.440
after the gates open.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.560
[Danny] Are you gonna wait for Hass?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.400
Sir, we're at the power station now.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.840
Fire service needs to get in

11:41.840 --> 11:45.040
to deal with the transformer
fire and evacuate staff,

11:45.040 --> 11:48.400
but there are reports of
some kind of IED on the gate.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.360
I'm gonna speak to the fire
commander and EXPO and, erm,

11:51.360 --> 11:52.200
(gentle music)

11:52.200 --> 11:54.320
and report back.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.400
Yes, sir.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.240
Lana.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.200
Thom.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.960
I was expecting Hass.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.040
Sorry, you got me.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.480
So what are we dealing with?

12:12.480 --> 12:15.400
Er, we've got two
devices on the access gate.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.880
They've rigged it so we can't
reach it from this side.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.840
And if anyone opens
a gate, it'll go off?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.080
Correct.

12:21.080 --> 12:21.920
DS Morgan.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.400
Lana Washington, EXPO.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.240
From the staff list,

12:25.240 --> 12:26.960
we know there are three
shift workers trapped inside.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.480
We're trying to establish
contact with them.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.320
How long have we got?

12:29.320 --> 12:32.120
The fire's about 20 metres
from the second transformer.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.280
And if that goes up the shift
workers won't stand a charge.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.640
We need to get inside ASAP.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.120
Can you cut a hole in the fence

12:39.120 --> 12:40.520
big enough for me to get through?

12:40.520 --> 12:42.600
Yeah, that's no problem.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.920
EXPO need access to the
other side of the gate.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.080
You two talk much?

12:50.080 --> 12:52.240
Er, no, not since I left.

12:53.080 --> 12:53.800
See you in a sec.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.760
[Hassan] Stranger.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.360
[Lana] What time do you call this?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
You all right?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.880
What's going on?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.040
What the fuck's he doing here?

13:01.040 --> 13:02.520
[Hassan] He's been
back a couple of months,

13:02.520 --> 13:04.160
he's on probation.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.080
He almost had me killed, he's dangerous.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.000
Not anymore, he's doing
good, he's buckled down.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.840
He's a racist, you said so yourself.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.840
He's trying to change.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.120
Look, the truth is we don't have enough

13:14.120 --> 13:15.520
trained personnel, Wash.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.960
He made a mistake, he knows it, okay?

13:16.960 --> 13:18.440
He's a valuable member of the team.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.400
My team.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.200
You were away, I was in charge.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.120
Decisions had to be made, I made them.

13:23.120 --> 13:23.960
- [Danny] Boss.
- Yeah?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.040
Yes?

13:27.000 --> 13:27.800
They're set.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.960
- I can handle this.
- I've got it.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.400
Danny, mate, stag do.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.320
Forget the paintballing, we'll
go to this little strip club

13:33.320 --> 13:34.920
in Whitechapel, yeah?

13:34.920 --> 13:36.400
My treat.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.360
It's your last night of freedom, mate.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.040
Yeah, sounds great, man.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.200
All right, Wash?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.160
There's two devices on the access gate

13:43.160 --> 13:45.240
and, er, we need to go through.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.520
(suspenseful music)

13:55.240 --> 13:56.520
(phone bleeps)

13:56.520 --> 13:59.360
(fire crackling)

14:00.680 --> 14:01.520
- Michael.
- Yeah.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.480
I'll need the Met Vest.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.040
[Michael] Yes, sir.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.360
There might be a trip in the devices.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.000
Disabling one could arm the other.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.600
So, what you thinking?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.160
Well, we could set both disrupters

14:11.160 --> 14:12.720
to fire at exactly the same time.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.400
You all right there, Wash?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.600
[Hassan] You need any
help just let me know.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.760
I'm fine.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.480
Danny, we're up.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.400
(suspenseful music continues)

14:32.280 --> 14:33.880
So, that's her then?

14:33.880 --> 14:35.600
What?

14:35.600 --> 14:36.680
Your ex.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.680
Oh, yeah.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.720
New guv. Sir.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.520
DCI Youngblood.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.040
I've just driven through
the City of London.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.120
It's pitch black, what's going on?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.880
EXPO 2, let them know
to expect two blasts.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.920
EXPO 8, setting off two

14:54.920 --> 14:57.200
simultaneous controlled explosions.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.160
Central Eight Five received.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.840
(fire crackling)

15:06.840 --> 15:10.040
(explosion rumbles)

15:10.040 --> 15:13.920
(suspenseful music continues)

15:21.080 --> 15:22.760
[Lana] Disrupters set.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.840
[Officer] Get down! Cover, cover!

15:26.440 --> 15:27.680
Danny, take the shot.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.280
Standby, firing.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.400
Three, two, one.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.920
(disrupter bangs)

15:33.920 --> 15:35.480
I only saw one blast.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.000
Er, it could be a misfire, sir.

15:37.000 --> 15:37.840
Hass, what's happening?

15:37.840 --> 15:38.960
Waiting on EXPO 2.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.000
[Shaun] We knee in.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.840
Danny, take the shot again.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.000
Standby.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.160
Firing in three, two, one.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.040
What the fuck?

15:55.160 --> 15:57.160
We've got a fault with the equipment.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.720
First device is clear.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.800
[Hassan] And the second device?

16:06.480 --> 16:07.360
(timer beeps)

16:07.360 --> 16:08.560
Shit.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.880
What's she doing?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.240
Hass, SITREP.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.240
Wash, what's going on?

16:12.240 --> 16:15.560
We've got a timer, our
actions must have set it off.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.400
How long?

16:16.400 --> 16:17.520
30 seconds!

16:17.520 --> 16:18.600
Okay, get out of there.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.440
Hard cover!

16:19.440 --> 16:20.680
[Officer] Get back, take cover.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.360
- Hard cover!
- Take cover!

16:22.360 --> 16:23.280
Who misses a timer?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.440
I swear down, will you just shut up!

16:24.440 --> 16:26.520
All right!

16:27.080 --> 16:27.800
(timer bleeps)

16:27.800 --> 16:29.880
[Lana] I'm replacing the disrupter.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.720
Wash, get away from there!

16:35.720 --> 16:36.800
Karl, get down!

16:36.800 --> 16:38.280
Move!

16:38.280 --> 16:39.320
Get away!

16:39.320 --> 16:41.400
10 seconds, Hass.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.840
(timer bleeps)

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
Danny, take the shot, take the shot!

16:45.840 --> 16:47.920
Firing, three, two, one.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.840
(disrupter bangs)

16:50.840 --> 16:53.040
(metal pipe clangs)

16:53.040 --> 16:55.119
EXPO 2, clear.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.359
Repeat, clear.

16:57.359 --> 16:59.119
Send them in.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.200
(Lana breathes heavily)

17:01.200 --> 17:02.520
Her first day, Hass.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.400
Just cut it-

17:03.400 --> 17:04.240
Will you just pack it in, yeah?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.320
Just saying.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.640
(siren wailing)

17:14.240 --> 17:16.960
(fire crackling)

17:21.280 --> 17:24.160
Wash, what happened back there?

17:24.160 --> 17:25.880
Cartridge failed.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.960
Are you okay?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.240
Really.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.960
(people chattering faintly)

17:35.600 --> 17:36.560
[Danny] Nice one, Hass.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.640
[Hassan] Not now, Danny.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.000
Commander John Francis.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.200
Hassan Rahim, EXPO.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.680
I know who you are, just
putting names to faces.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.160
So you're the senior EXPO?

17:47.160 --> 17:49.000
Yes, sir, I've been standing
in for Lana Washington

17:49.000 --> 17:49.880
for the last six months.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.440
And done a cracking job, I hear.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.560
Thank you, sir.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.040
Well, she's back now, tomorrow officially.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.480
But she led the op?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.840
Yes, sir, she was
near, first on the scene.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.160
You sounded concerned on the radio.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.240
What was the problem?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.640
Just a technical issue, sir.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And she's been away on secondment?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.680
Yes, sir, she's been
teaching bomb disposal

18:13.680 --> 18:15.680
to the Ukrainian EODs.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.440
Oh.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.520
We had some problems before.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.920
Her brother.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.400
I believe he was killed in a
terrorist related incident.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.960
And this, er, this other EXPO

18:27.960 --> 18:30.040
who orchestrated the bombing campaign.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.560
It was difficult for us all, sir.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.160
Of course it was.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.160
Manufacturing fault maybe.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.360
Yeah, I'll get it checked out.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.240
Yeah.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.520
You're back then?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.160
Yeah, with a bang.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.320
(they chuckle)

18:46.320 --> 18:47.960
And you did well.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.560
First live shout since...

18:50.560 --> 18:52.640
Yeah, yeah, of course.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.680
You were missed.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.320
Yeah?

18:57.320 --> 18:58.960
How you been, you good?

18:58.960 --> 19:00.080
Yeah, great.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.320
Got promoted, I see.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.760
Golden boy.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.720
Only a matter of time and
I'll be running the whole Met.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.000
(Lana laughs)

19:07.000 --> 19:09.160
I, er, hear congratulations are in order.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.000
Yeah, cheers.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.320
Yeah, getting wed, don't
get more grown up than that.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.240
Yeah, well, she's the one, so.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.000
Single life, it does have its limits.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.680
What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.800
Er, erm, well, this job,
you know what it's like.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.440
Yeah, I get it.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.240
Erm, Commander Francis is
here, he'd like to meet you.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.640
Is this your new boss?

19:28.640 --> 19:30.600
And yours too, so be polite.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.840
I'm always fucking polite.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.200
Lana, erm, Commander John Francis.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.520
EXPO Washington.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.360
Sir.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.080
Impressive work back there.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.600
Yep, the device is clear.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.200
And once the power station is secure

19:42.200 --> 19:43.920
I'll send forensics in to take a look.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.640
Very good. Great to
see a woman in the job.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.760
Is it?

19:47.760 --> 19:48.800
Of course.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.840
And unusual.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.760
Yeah, well that's me, I'm unusual.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.040
What was the problem with the diffuser?

19:55.040 --> 19:57.840
Er, the disrupter.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.880
I mean, we normally just
call it the pig stick.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.640
Oh, how eloquent.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.480
(phone rings)

20:02.480 --> 20:04.400
Oh, excuse me.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.640
It's a technical issue, faulty
cartridge, it does happen.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.840
Ah, a technical issue.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.120
That's what EXPO Rahim said too.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.600
Didn't feel the need for the bomb suit?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.400
No, if the device functioned, it,

20:19.400 --> 20:21.040
the suit wouldn't save me anyway.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.000
It can get in the way.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.720
Well, as long as you're comfortable.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.800
Sir.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.760
(water splashes)

20:28.760 --> 20:29.920
(fire officers speak faintly)

20:29.920 --> 20:32.520
(tense music)

20:37.680 --> 20:39.720
I want the jet in from the side.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.800
[Fireman] Right.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.200
Come on, move out.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.480
Scout around the locality.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.000
Someone would've seen what happened.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.960
Maybe we get lucky and
they filmed something.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.720
Thank you.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.160
Helen.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.080
Are EMT finished with the station workers?

21:02.080 --> 21:02.920
Can any of them tell us what happened?

21:02.920 --> 21:06.640
Erm, well, two of them are dead.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.440
The third one, Joe Hanson,
he hasn't been found.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.880
Okay, er, CCTV?

21:13.880 --> 21:16.800
- There isn't any.
- How is that possible?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.280
It's monitored remotely,

21:18.280 --> 21:20.680
but the coverage after 6:00 PM is missing.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.760
Maybe they were hacked.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.520
- Got a live one.
- Coming through!

21:26.520 --> 21:28.600
[Helen] Yeah, I've got this.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.560
[Lana] What's with those two?

21:33.560 --> 21:37.000
Oh, Danny's been working
with John since you were away.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.320
And they get on like a house on fire.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.240
Really?

21:40.240 --> 21:42.320
Wash.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.920
Thank you for backing
me up with Francis.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.880
Of course.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.640
And for stepping up
while I was on secondment.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.440
It means a lot, I appreciate it.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.440
It's no biggie, okay?

21:53.440 --> 21:56.200
I just hope that, you know,
it's cleared your head a bit.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.840
Getting away can, can do that.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.920
You'd think so, yeah.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.640
I've made some mistakes. Whew.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.480
I need to put that one right.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.280
Heads up, that ship has sailed.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.440
Thom and Helen, they're an item now.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.040
[Thom] Oi.

22:19.040 --> 22:19.840
Thirsty work, innit?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.000
Yeah, want some?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.080
I'm prepared.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.880
Girl Scout?

22:25.880 --> 22:27.960
Er, common sense.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.720
Erm, look, talking of common sense,

22:32.720 --> 22:35.520
just go easy on the new commander.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.280
He's just come in, he's
looking for any excuse

22:37.280 --> 22:38.480
to stamp his authority, so just-

22:38.480 --> 22:40.680
Okay, you know me.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.760
Yeah, well, exactly.

22:46.400 --> 22:50.520
DCI Youngblood, Joe
Hanson, the missing engineer.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.840
Has he said anything?

22:51.840 --> 22:54.200
No, he is in no fit
state to be interviewed.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.360
Thom, in light of the gate IEDs

22:56.360 --> 22:58.360
we're declaring this a major incident.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.840
We've got a call with DACSO in 30 minutes.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.120
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

23:02.120 --> 23:03.240
(phone chimes)

23:03.240 --> 23:04.400
Not like this, no, sir.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.840
[Commander] Any thoughts who
might be behind this and why?

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
You should see this.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.120
What is it?

23:11.120 --> 23:13.200
[Helen] It's a link from HQ.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.360
It's all over the internet.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.360
(tense music)

23:33.920 --> 23:35.720
(suspenseful music)

23:36.000 --> 23:37.720
Since the attack, there's
been mass panic on Twitter.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.560
It's gonna hit the news
channels any minute.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.880
We need to prioritise locating
the drone pilot's site.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.800
That should offer us
forensics, CCTV, witnesses.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.680
Batra, was there anything
on the video itself

23:48.680 --> 23:49.480
that could help us?

23:49.480 --> 23:52.040
The account's registered
under a series of false names.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.680
We can't locate the IP either.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.200
Well, this is clearly a
sophisticated terrorist attack.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.000
Power stations are robust.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.840
It would take skill, technical knowledge

23:59.840 --> 24:01.520
to pull something like this off.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.080
We're gonna have politicians
and the commissioner

24:03.080 --> 24:04.840
breathing down our necks very soon.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.400
Let's speak to the Security
Services, see if they can help.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.800
Any groups that have used
similar wording in videos,

24:11.800 --> 24:14.400
both at home and overseas.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.360
Also, anything they have on
terrorist groups using drones.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.360
Oh, we've already
received a few tip-offs

24:19.360 --> 24:21.200
about drones being piloted nearby, sir.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.960
You look at the footage from the drone.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.200
It looks like the drone
flew in from the west.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.800
If that drone operates on line of sight,

24:27.800 --> 24:30.200
then the pilot would need
an elevated position.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.560
So, it means we're looking
somewhere in that corridor there.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.760
Well, in that zone we've
had one sighting of a drone

24:40.760 --> 24:44.120
being launched from an
abandoned multi-story car park.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.560
Crayford Place Car Park.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.200
Yep, someone called it
in about an hour ago.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.480
An anonymous tip, we're
trying to trace the call.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.320
Er, there it is.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.520
I want forensics there.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.160
I want an outside inquiry team there now.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.560
They need to be able to get in

24:58.560 --> 25:01.000
once firearms and EXPO
have cleared it, okay?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.080
(suspenseful music continues)

25:03.080 --> 25:04.920
(siren wailing)

25:04.920 --> 25:06.280
[Operator] Control to all units.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.800
We have a report of movement
within the car park.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.040
Approach with caution.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.280
[Officer] We understand
the car park is derelict.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.800
(indistinct)

25:16.440 --> 25:18.880
We believe the drone
pilot used this building.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.960
It would've been based on the roof.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.680
Head to the top of the building.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.360
EXPO will be running support.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.080
Our priority is to gather evidence,

25:27.080 --> 25:30.040
but be prepared to find and detain.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.280
Post a guard on the ground floor

25:31.280 --> 25:33.360
in case anyone tries to run.

25:33.840 --> 25:34.920
Where's the access point?

25:34.920 --> 25:36.040
[Officer] It's over there, sir.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.600
Thank you.

25:37.600 --> 25:42.000
So, you and John, best buds now, are ya?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.480
As if.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.480
I got lumped with him.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.920
I actually wanted to work with
Hass whilst you were away,

25:47.920 --> 25:50.000
but they allocated me to John.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.960
I guess he thinks it's
cool to be mates now.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.840
[Lana] Hmm.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.520
He's playing Hass, Lana.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.880
He's got HR eating out
of the palm of his hands.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.200
[Lana] I'm sorry because
you were lumbered with him

26:00.200 --> 26:01.640
and that's my fault.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.680
Don't mention it.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.080
You stay down here,
I'm gonna go with Hass.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.280
If I need you, I'll give you a call.

26:06.280 --> 26:10.360
Oi, I'll hold the fort down here, okay?

26:11.920 --> 26:12.960
You ready?

26:12.960 --> 26:15.560
(tense music)

26:20.880 --> 26:22.160
Follow me.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.240
Awkward.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.680
Have you told her?

26:37.440 --> 26:39.440
About us.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.560
What, now?

26:41.560 --> 26:42.960
[Officer] Trojan Four
to Central Eight Five,

26:42.960 --> 26:44.240
we are proceeding with our ascent

26:44.240 --> 26:46.640
to check and clear car park levels.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.720
(suspenseful music)

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
[Officer] Armed police, stop!

26:57.160 --> 26:59.000
[Officer] Trojan Nine, possible contact

26:59.000 --> 27:01.080
in the 10th floor stairwell.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.200
(bang in distance)

27:03.200 --> 27:05.280
[Officer] This floor, come on.

27:06.520 --> 27:10.320
(suspenseful music continues)

27:45.360 --> 27:49.360
(suspenseful music intensifies)

28:02.600 --> 28:04.000
No, don't, I've got a baby!

28:04.000 --> 28:06.640
(baby gurgles)

28:06.640 --> 28:09.000
Are you the only ones in this car park?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.880
Seen any other rough sleepers?

28:12.840 --> 28:13.600
Where?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.200
There's an old man,
he's covered in cardboard,

28:15.200 --> 28:17.360
and, and a few others come and go.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.160
Have you seen anyone
new in the last 12 hours?

28:20.160 --> 28:22.240
A stranger?

28:22.960 --> 28:25.280
Right, Trojan Four to Central Eight Five,

28:25.280 --> 28:28.040
we have a family on floor
10, request back up.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.120
We are now ascending to the next level.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.280
[Lana] So you're back on the team then.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.520
[John] Should never have been off it.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.600
That it? No apology?

28:39.880 --> 28:42.120
I have nothing to apologise for.

28:42.120 --> 28:46.280
Said some stuff, made some mistakes.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.120
Mistakes?

28:47.120 --> 28:48.920
Yeah, just like you.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.080
Although I didn't screw
a terrorist, did I?

28:51.080 --> 28:54.360
Or ex-squaddie with a grievance,
as I prefer to call him.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.600
One step outta line, John.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.880
You know, everything's
been running all right

28:57.880 --> 28:58.720
while you've been away.

28:58.720 --> 29:03.200
Hass is a top senior, knows
his stuff, very respectful.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.040
And as for me and Danny,

29:04.040 --> 29:05.760
well, we're getting on
like an house on fire.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.880
In fact, I'm planning his stag do.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.560
We're a great team, so
why the fuck are you back?

29:12.560 --> 29:14.120
I'm your superior officer, John.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.280
No, you're not superior to me in anyway,

29:16.280 --> 29:17.080
do you understand?

29:17.080 --> 29:18.800
You haven't changed at all, have you?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.040
Neither have you.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.680
Six months away and it's
done nothing for you, has it?

29:23.680 --> 29:25.160
You're still fucked.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.240
I know it and so do they.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.320
How's she doing?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.240
Wash.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.600
Ready for duty, fighting fit?

29:40.600 --> 29:41.760
EXPO Rahim.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.600
Sir.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.440
Fill me in.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.800
CTSFO are going floor to
floor, heading to the roof, sir.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.600
Any joy?

29:46.600 --> 29:47.520
Sir, I don't know yet.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.600
Very good.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.040
Central Eight Five, received.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.120
We've got civilians up there.

29:59.120 --> 29:59.960
How many?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.160
Er, two adults and a baby,
possibly more on other levels,

30:02.160 --> 30:03.680
so I need you to clear the floor

30:03.680 --> 30:05.080
and I need you to find a holding area.

30:05.080 --> 30:05.920
[Officer] Yes, sir.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.720
Shouldn't you interrogate them?

30:06.720 --> 30:07.560
We'll question them,

30:07.560 --> 30:09.440
but the first priority is
clearing the building, sir.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.360
And I think for your own safety,

30:11.360 --> 30:12.640
you should stay down here, sir.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.840
Let's go.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.880
[Officer] Trojan One
to Central Eight Five,

30:16.880 --> 30:18.240
we are proceeding to the roof.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.240
EXPO 2 and Trojan Four
are checking level 11.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.440
(suspenseful music)

30:24.440 --> 30:26.320
Okay, thanks.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.280
Hey, get a message to Gold Commander.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.680
Telecoms intel says that
the car park tip off

30:30.680 --> 30:33.400
came from a burner phone
purchased yesterday.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.480
Could be a trap.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.440
[Operator] Control to all units.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.600
New Intel has been acquired

30:38.600 --> 30:40.440
about the anonymous phone tip off.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.520
Proceed with extreme caution.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.120
[Officer] Bolt cutters.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.920
Central Eight Five, this is Trojan One.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.960
We are proceeding with roof recon

30:56.960 --> 30:59.880
using extreme caution as instructed.

30:59.880 --> 31:00.800
[Thom] Copy that.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.160
Possible IED threat
detected by Trojan Four

31:03.160 --> 31:04.200
on the floor below you.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.280
EXPO 2 is currently investigating.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.520
[Lana] That's it, I'm
nearly there, just stay still.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.920
Trip wire, Wash?

31:25.040 --> 31:27.960
I take it that's a no, yeah, dunno?

31:29.760 --> 31:33.600
(suspenseful music continues)

31:52.440 --> 31:54.240
(Lana sighs)

31:54.240 --> 31:55.080
[Lana] Nothing.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.560
EXPO 7 clear.

31:56.560 --> 32:01.320
IED threat is a false
alarm on car park level 11.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.080
[Officer] Clear.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.840
Trojan One to Central
Eight Five, no visuals.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.920
[Thom] Copy that, hold your position.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.400
It's just a bit of wire, mate.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.280
Sometimes it gets caught in
your clothes and your boots.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.960
Guys, you're not meant to be up here yet.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.040
Sorry.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.400
What's that?

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
[Thom] Could be a drone
controller, I'll get it.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.680
No, nobody touch anything.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.440
Right, everybody
needs to get back. Move!

32:32.440 --> 32:33.560
Just hold on a minute, mate.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.640
(pressure plate clicks)

32:35.640 --> 32:37.800
(bomb beeps)

32:37.800 --> 32:39.880
What the fuck's that?

32:41.960 --> 32:42.720
(bomb beeps rapidly)

32:42.720 --> 32:43.560
No!

32:43.560 --> 32:46.480
(explosion booms)

32:51.560 --> 32:54.240
(Helen gasps)

32:54.240 --> 32:57.720
(Lana breathing heavily)

33:00.440 --> 33:02.440
We're a great team.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.800
(Thom breathing heavily)

33:18.800 --> 33:22.320
(Helen breathing heavily)

33:24.640 --> 33:26.280
(pressure plate clicks)

33:26.280 --> 33:30.280
(suspenseful music continues)

33:30.280 --> 33:32.360
Lana.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.200
I think I've, I think
I've stood on something.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.440
Don't move.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.839
Don't move an inch.

33:49.839 --> 33:52.440
(tense music)

33:52.560 --> 33:54.680
Get back! Get back now!

33:54.680 --> 33:56.600
[Officer] Move!

33:56.600 --> 33:58.679
Thom.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.719
Lana, do something.

34:00.719 --> 34:02.040
I'm coming.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.120
Stay still, stay really, really still.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.960
(tense music)

34:07.960 --> 34:10.640
EXPO 2, we have contact.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.960
IED contact, wait out.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.240
[Hassan] Copy that, we're on our way.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.960
We're coming to you.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.359
No, nobody comes out
here, that is an order.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.840
I heard, erm, like a noisy clack

34:31.840 --> 34:33.920
underneath my, er, right foot.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.680
Stay still for me, yeah?

34:47.319 --> 34:49.480
(detector beeping)

34:49.480 --> 34:52.560
(beeping speeds up)

35:12.600 --> 35:15.600
(glow light cracks)

35:18.680 --> 35:20.279
Tell me.

35:20.279 --> 35:22.359
You're standing on a pressure plate.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.440
When you step on it, it activates.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.960
When you step off it-

35:27.960 --> 35:29.720
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

35:29.720 --> 35:30.560
Don't move!

35:30.560 --> 35:32.640
Helen, Helen!

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
Don't move.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.480
Oh, my God.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.840
They're everywhere.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.920
What?

35:56.359 --> 35:59.160
We're in the middle
of a fucking minefield.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.720
(Helen pants)

36:05.920 --> 36:08.760
Lana, talk to me.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.840
Lana, you okay?

36:11.480 --> 36:13.480
Lana?

36:15.359 --> 36:17.359
Danny, get back, get back.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.160
The officer triggered a device.

36:21.279 --> 36:23.319
John got caught in the blast.

36:23.319 --> 36:25.400
They're dead.

36:26.200 --> 36:26.960
I'm coming over.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.920
Hass, Thom stepped on a device too.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.080
If he steps off, it'll activate.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.279
Just stay where you are.

36:33.279 --> 36:34.359
How many IEDs?

36:34.359 --> 36:35.560
I don't know.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.400
Helen.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.240
Yeah.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.880
I need you to make your way to the door.

36:38.880 --> 36:39.720
Okay.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.200
Just move really
slowly, really carefully.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.240
Don't step on the cardboard

36:43.240 --> 36:45.160
and just stick to the concrete, okay?

36:45.160 --> 36:46.040
Go.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.640
Yeah.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.440
Go.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.240
[Thom] Go, it's fine.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.520
Helen.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.600
Stay with me, come on.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.279
You're doing great.

36:59.279 --> 37:01.359
That's, that's good.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.319
Good, good.

37:03.319 --> 37:05.120
One more step.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.279
Good, that's it, you're nearly there.

37:07.279 --> 37:08.120
Yeah, yeah.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.760
[Hassan] Well done,
there you go, there you go.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.319
Okay, everyone back, back.

37:11.319 --> 37:12.680
Look, I can help.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.520
Hass, no!

37:13.520 --> 37:15.040
Danny, keep the door clear.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.120
All right, look, you've
gotta move back, all right?

37:16.120 --> 37:16.960
Yeah, and what about Thom?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.400
No, Lana's got the
situation in hand, let's go.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
[Helen] Okay, yeah, but-

37:19.400 --> 37:20.520
Hang on, hang on a sec.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.800
Hey, it's okay, there we go.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.600
Okay.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.720
Just go and take a seat.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.560
Okay.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.400
Yeah, there you go, sit.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.200
You okay?
- Yeah.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.319
You all right?

37:28.319 --> 37:31.480
It's gonna be okay, it's
gonna be okay, she's the best.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
Yeah.

37:32.480 --> 37:34.560
That's it, deep breath.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.080
Danny?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.800
Just keep an eye on her.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.240
(detector beeping rapidly)

37:46.240 --> 37:48.760
(Thom pants)

37:51.920 --> 37:53.480
(glow light cracks)

37:53.480 --> 37:56.000
(suspenseful music continues)

37:56.000 --> 37:57.800
[Lana] You all right?

37:57.800 --> 38:01.319
(Thom continues panting)

38:04.000 --> 38:04.760
You okay?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.760
Oh, I'm shaking, my whole
fucking body's shaking.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.040
I know, you just need to breathe.

38:09.040 --> 38:09.880
Okay.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.279
Deep breath, deep breaths, okay?

38:13.279 --> 38:15.319
Oh, God. Oh, listen, listen, listen.

38:15.319 --> 38:16.560
You need to listen to me.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.160
You just go, go.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.560
You should take your opportunity and go.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.359
Thom, I'm not goin anyway.

38:20.359 --> 38:21.440
There's no point. I don't
want anything to happen to you.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.279
Thom-

38:22.279 --> 38:23.120
- Please, please, just go.
- I don't think-

38:23.120 --> 38:23.960
Go now!

38:23.960 --> 38:25.600
No, Thom, nothing's gonna happen to me.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.560
Listen to me.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.120
I'm in control, okay?

38:28.120 --> 38:28.920
Okay, okay.

38:28.920 --> 38:29.960
All right? Just shut up.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.440
Yeah, yeah.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.520
You need to be still,
you're stood on a bomb!

38:34.520 --> 38:36.840
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

38:36.840 --> 38:37.960
Do you trust me?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.760
Yes.

38:39.760 --> 38:40.800
Yes, of course I do.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.960
- I'm in charge.
- Yeah.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.240
- I know what I'm doing.
- Yeah.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.319
And I'm gonna neutralise
the device, okay?

38:45.319 --> 38:46.200
Okay.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.480
Just stay still.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.560
Jesus, okay.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.760
Right.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.760
Okay.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.840
Oh, God.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.960
Really still and we'll
be out of here, okay?

39:03.160 --> 39:05.160
Oh, okay.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.560
It's all right, okay.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.560
I just need to cut back some cardboard.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.640
[Thom] Okay, okay.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.760
- And then-
- Yeah.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.800
[Lana] I just need you
to stay really still.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
Lan, I'm so sorry.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.319
[Lana] Now is not
the time for apologies.

39:17.319 --> 39:18.960
You shouldn't be here,
I shouldn't be here.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.560
This is my fucking fault, honestly-

39:20.560 --> 39:21.600
[Lana] Thom!

39:21.600 --> 39:22.520
I should've fucking
never walked up here.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.080
- Thom!
- So fucking stupid!

39:24.080 --> 39:27.040
Stop, you're getting irate
and you're moving, okay?

39:27.040 --> 39:28.000
Okay, okay.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.600
- Please just stay still.
- I know.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.440
The more you move-

39:30.440 --> 39:33.279
[Thom] Yeah, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, sorry.

39:33.279 --> 39:35.080
This is not the time for a meltdown.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.840
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.920
I'm not gonna let you die.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.840
I'm not gonna let that happen.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.520
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.600
Because I love you.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.400
I always have, I always will,
nothing will ever change that,

39:51.400 --> 39:53.760
so I'm not letting you
go anywhere, all right?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.120
You're doing great.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.840
You just need to give me a bit more time.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.680
[Thom] All right.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.680
Just 60 seconds, that's all I need.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.240
Just get me, let me get
under this cardboard,

40:07.240 --> 40:09.319
and then we're out of here, okay?

40:11.480 --> 40:12.279
(radio bleeps)

40:12.279 --> 40:15.040
(siren wailing)

40:17.200 --> 40:18.120
(Helen sighs)

40:18.120 --> 40:20.800
(phone chimes)

40:29.160 --> 40:31.640
(Helen pants)

40:34.240 --> 40:37.760
Sir, sir, you shouldn't be
up here, it's too dangerous.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.800
DS Morgan, SITREP?

40:39.800 --> 40:42.880
Sir, it's streaming now.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.440
[Lana] I'm nearly
there, I'm nearly there.

41:02.680 --> 41:04.440
I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.240
[Lana] You can.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.600
I'm panicking, I'm
panicking, I'm panicking.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.440
I can't breathe.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.680
Can you feel my hand?

41:08.680 --> 41:09.760
- Yeah, I can.
- Yeah?

41:09.760 --> 41:10.560
I can.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.560
- Feel it?
- Yeah.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.600
Where's your other hand?

41:12.600 --> 41:13.440
Hey, here.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.520
That's it, bring them together.

41:16.279 --> 41:19.000
Not because I need you to pray,
it'll just keep you steady.

41:19.000 --> 41:19.840
[Thom] Okay.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.560
Stop shaking, I'm here, that's it.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.600
- Okay.
- Yeah?

41:23.600 --> 41:24.560
Yeah.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.760
You're doing great.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.160
Okay.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.240
[Lana] Just breathe.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.960
(suspenseful music)

41:34.960 --> 41:38.480
(Lana breathing heavily)

41:56.160 --> 41:57.520
Nearly there.

41:57.520 --> 42:02.640
Lana, did you, did you
mean that, what you said?

42:02.640 --> 42:04.000
Of course I did.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.160
Why, why couldn't you have
just said that six months ago?

42:06.160 --> 42:07.359
Thom, can you see what I'm dealing with?

42:07.359 --> 42:08.600
Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm fucking,

42:08.600 --> 42:10.000
I'm fucking scared, I'm scared.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.840
Well guess what, Thom? I'm scared.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.240
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.359
I'm at the wire, Thom.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.600
Right, you're gonna have to be

42:19.600 --> 42:21.680
really, really still now, okay?

42:24.040 --> 42:25.840
I'm going in.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.400
(suspenseful music continues)

42:28.400 --> 42:31.040
(Thom panting)

42:32.279 --> 42:33.560
There we go.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.560
That should be it.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.640
Okay.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.120
We're good, we're good.

42:41.120 --> 42:43.080
You're gonna step off now.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.080
Trust me.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.279
Trust me?

42:46.279 --> 42:47.240
Come on.
- All right.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.080
(pressure plate clicks)

42:48.080 --> 42:50.640
That's it, that's it.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.319
That was close.
- Yeah.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.359
That was close.

42:53.359 --> 42:57.640
(both breathing heavily)

42:57.640 --> 42:59.720
You're all right.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.640
(gentle music)

43:05.359 --> 43:07.560
Okay, I need to-

43:07.560 --> 43:08.680
Yeah.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.600
I'm dealing with this shit show.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.400
Okay, right.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.920
Yeah, we'll fucking
get these guys, Lana.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.800
I swear on my fucking life.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.000
(drone whirring)

43:28.000 --> 43:29.560
What the fuck is that?

43:29.560 --> 43:31.359
(suspenseful music)

43:31.359 --> 43:35.040
(drone continues whirring)

44:04.480 --> 44:05.359
Thom, get down.

44:05.359 --> 44:07.319
Thom, what are you doing?!

44:07.319 --> 44:11.400
(suspenseful music intensifies)

44:17.279 --> 44:19.279
Quick!

44:20.080 --> 44:23.200
(gun firing rapidly)

44:23.200 --> 44:25.880
(explosion booms)

44:25.880 --> 44:28.359
(Lana pants)

44:31.400 --> 44:32.960
[Hassan] Hey, are you okay?

44:32.960 --> 44:34.120
Another drone attack.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.800
EXPO 8, there's been
another drone attack.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.319
Make your way towards me.

44:37.319 --> 44:39.240
Careful, careful where you tread.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.840
(tense music)

44:42.760 --> 44:44.440
Oh!

44:44.440 --> 44:46.240
Oh, my!

44:46.240 --> 44:48.600
Oh, I thought I'd lost you.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.680
I love you.

44:51.279 --> 44:52.080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.040
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

44:54.040 --> 44:57.760
Okay, er, I'm gonna
check on Hass, all right?

44:57.760 --> 44:59.840
Just sit tight.

45:00.319 --> 45:01.400
Thom, are you okay?

45:01.400 --> 45:02.760
Yes, sir.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.240
Look, I've just seen what's happened.

45:04.240 --> 45:06.319
They're streaming it.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.560
Who the hell are these people?

45:24.560 --> 45:27.560
(suspenseful music)

45:29.560 --> 45:30.319
Thom!

45:30.319 --> 45:32.520
There's someone on the roof
over there, the tower block.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.240
He's moving now, he's heading down.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.359
Er, okay, Helen, call it in, call it in.

45:37.359 --> 45:38.520
[Danny] Sir.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.040
Sorry, sir, you can't go
out there, it's not safe.

45:41.040 --> 45:41.880
[Helen] Is that it?

45:41.880 --> 45:44.120
That's it, that's it.
