00:02.020 --> 00:04.179
John Dee was a scryer. He thought
he was talking to angels.

00:04.180 --> 00:06.979
You can only hear their voices if you're
pure of heart, like a small child.

00:06.980 --> 00:10.699
The dog found something,
a child's bones.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.939
You're saying Carys is dead.

00:12.940 --> 00:15.739
There was a bracelet on the wrist.
What if there were two children?

00:15.740 --> 00:17.339
What if they took two?

00:17.340 --> 00:21.339
I feel like there's something in me.
I'm scared of what I'm going to see.

00:21.340 --> 00:24.499
It says the name of a real
hospital, a real doctor,

00:24.500 --> 00:27.979
a real mother and father.
That's not me. Mother, Janice Gray.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.099
Why are doing this?

00:29.100 --> 00:30.660
If you won't stop this, I will.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.379
You're saying that she
arrived in the area a few

00:38.380 --> 00:41.500
months before Carys went missing,
and then she disappeared?

00:47.740 --> 00:50.739
Can you just tell me
he's all right? No sign of a driver.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.940
It seems like your friend's
disappeared.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.020
Let me out!

01:26.540 --> 01:31.219
Let me out! Carys, hey! It's OK.
I told you I'd be right back.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.419
Come on, Carys. I got you sweets.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.779
Where am I? I want my mummy!
I want to go home.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.699
All the ones you wanted.
I want my mummy!

01:37.700 --> 01:40.339
I've done the mirrors, covered them
up. Just like you said.

01:40.340 --> 01:42.899
I want my mummy! Carys! Shh.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.500
You have got to quieten down.
Or you'll get us both killed.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.140
Do you understand?

01:50.580 --> 01:54.419
Good girl. Now, do you remember
what I told you? We need to hide.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.659
Because those people back here,
they are bad people.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.979
And if those bad people find us,

01:58.980 --> 02:01.979
they are going to do
bad things to us.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.380
Do you understand? Yeah?

02:13.060 --> 02:18.300
OK? We've got a long drive.
Best get going. OK?

02:56.460 --> 02:59.819
He can't have just disappeared.
Straight to voicemail.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.819
Maybe it's switched off. Police
said that he had been to Manchester.

03:02.820 --> 03:05.899
If he went all the way there,
then he must have tried to call me.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.779
I could check in the car, maybe
it's under the seats. Find phone.

03:09.780 --> 03:11.219
I'll do find phone. What?

03:11.220 --> 03:12.619
It's an app, Hal put it on my iPad

03:12.620 --> 03:14.339
and it sets off an alarm
on your phone.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.139
I know what is, but that only works

03:16.140 --> 03:18.419
when the phone is switched on,
doesn't it?

03:18.420 --> 03:20.540
I don't know.
It's worth trying, isn't it?

03:47.300 --> 03:50.860
It's here. What?
It was just there.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.099
I looked there,
like five minutes ago.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.020
It was right down,
beneath the cushion.

04:11.180 --> 04:13.020
'Message received today at 11:42am.'

04:15.180 --> 04:16.899
'Tilly, I know you're angry with me,

04:16.899 --> 04:19.178
'but I've dug up some
stuff about your dad.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.019
'And just call me as soon as
you can, it's important.'

04:25.300 --> 04:29.299
'Next new message.
You need to pick up, Tilly.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.979
'Your mum, Janice - you were right.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.659
'She wasn't your mum, she was a cop.
Mary McKeown.

04:33.660 --> 04:36.899
'She changed her name and took
the identity of a dead woman

04:36.900 --> 04:39.059
'and I think she took you.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.979
'I don't know why or what's going
on, but I am heading back now.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.180
'For God's sake, Matilda, call me
when you can.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.100
'End of messages.'

04:56.940 --> 04:59.660
What did he say? Nick.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.380
Did you have my phone?

05:03.620 --> 05:09.339
No. I... Whatever Hal said,
whatever that is, it's not true.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.260
You did, you took my phone.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.940
Why the fuck did you do that?

05:16.020 --> 05:17.060
I'm sorry.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.700
Why?

05:24.660 --> 05:25.940
They told me to watch you.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.740
Jesus. You're in on it.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.939
No.

05:34.940 --> 05:38.859
You lied to me! I didn't mean to,
I was just trying to...

05:38.860 --> 05:40.659
You lied to me!
I didn't mean to,

05:40.660 --> 05:43.619
I just wanted to get my money and
they said they would sort it out

05:43.620 --> 05:47.219
if I cooperated, and then Meredith
died and I didn't expect her to die!

05:47.220 --> 05:49.500
I just wanted my money.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.539
So, they killed Meredith?

05:53.540 --> 05:54.700
Who?

05:56.740 --> 05:59.100
Sylvia? The Satlows?

06:00.860 --> 06:05.459
They'll know if I say something.
They'll know. Where's Hal?

06:05.460 --> 06:07.980
I don't know. Tell me. I don't know.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.859
Please, I just...

06:10.860 --> 06:13.979
All I do know is that they
are planning something tonight,

06:13.980 --> 06:15.739
something big. Something bad.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.619
Is Graves in on this?

06:17.620 --> 06:21.139
I don't think so. Then you're
going to come with me. No.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.980
And you're going to tell her
what you know. No, no!

06:25.300 --> 06:27.819
They'll set those things on to her,
they'll kill her.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.700
I've seen what they can do. My
uncle, your mum, Meredith, now Hal.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.979
Are you saying that
they've killed Hal?

06:35.980 --> 06:38.339
I don't know. Are you?
You have to tell me!

06:38.340 --> 06:40.179
Matilda, you've got to just
keep your voice down.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.580
They could be listening.
If they do, they will hear us and...

06:59.340 --> 07:00.620
Jesus!

07:01.660 --> 07:02.940
Sean...

07:07.940 --> 07:09.860
How did this happen?

07:19.780 --> 07:23.099
I did this. I did this.
No. I stabbed you.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.539
It was them, riding you.

07:25.540 --> 07:29.339
Listen, Carys. The thin ones
came again.

07:29.340 --> 07:35.739
And they told me you've got to go.
Back home, right now, this minute.

07:35.740 --> 07:39.019
I'm not going anywhere.
There's something out here.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.179
Not like the thin ones.

07:41.180 --> 07:45.380
Something different.
It means you harm.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.980
I won't leave you. And I won't
leave Hal. Then you'll die.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.659
That's what they told me.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.980
If you stay, you're going to die.

07:59.860 --> 08:03.819
We need an ambulance. Nick! Nick!

08:03.820 --> 08:05.300
Shit.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.859
Sorry, love.

08:34.860 --> 08:41.219
I didn't want to interrupt you,
but the constable... has some news.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.340
About your English friend?

08:51.940 --> 08:56.260
We met for coffee. Thank you.
Just before he had his accident?

08:57.420 --> 08:59.499
He was asking about an old copper,

08:59.500 --> 09:02.619
thought she might be involved in the
Carys Howell business. Involved?

09:02.620 --> 09:04.780
How? I don't think he knew himself.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.659
I said I would try to find out what
became of her, other than that...

09:09.660 --> 09:12.619
And he seemed OK. Sober?

09:12.620 --> 09:15.419
He was worried about his friend,
Matilda.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.940
Otherwise perfectly normal.

09:18.020 --> 09:21.939
We had a bit of drama last night,
up at Dean House.

09:21.940 --> 09:26.379
From what I hear, Eddie Fenton
and Aron Morgan have been bad boys.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.300
We had a chat, Eddie and me,
about the night Ewan died.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.700
He puts you there.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.300
Does he?

09:38.100 --> 09:41.179
Explain that to me, Stephen.

09:41.180 --> 09:44.300
Ewan and I went back 30 years.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.699
He was a good man.
Served this community...

09:47.700 --> 09:49.220
I don't give a shit about that.

09:50.540 --> 09:54.619
I need you to tell me, were you
involved in that drug cultivation?

09:54.620 --> 09:56.060
I was not.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.939
I knew Ewan had his vices.

09:59.940 --> 10:04.059
I didn't think it fair
his reputation be destroyed

10:04.060 --> 10:07.379
over drugs he might be holding,
for personal use. Personal use?

10:07.380 --> 10:09.459
That's what I expected to find.

10:09.460 --> 10:13.459
In any event, when I got the call
saying he was dead, I headed over.

10:13.460 --> 10:17.260
To... clean up the house before
the emergency services arrived.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.900
A call from Aron Morgan?

10:21.460 --> 10:24.219
So, Morgan calls you,
says there's a dead man

10:24.220 --> 10:27.019
and you don't ask any questions
about what Morgan's doing there?

10:27.020 --> 10:29.619
He was doing me a favour by calling
me. I returned it by not prying.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.699
And in doing so, you turned a blind
eye to a major drug cultivation.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.579
Grown on your watch,
officer, not mine.

10:34.580 --> 10:38.139
Don't be hard on yourself. If we arrested
everyone in town who was breaking the law,

10:38.140 --> 10:40.780
half of Penllynith would be banged
up. We both know the game.

10:47.220 --> 10:50.539
I know the game
because you taught me.

10:50.540 --> 10:51.580
But now I've had enough.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.580
PC Graves.

11:04.780 --> 11:07.339
Come on, now. No, please, please!
I don't want it.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.619
I don't need the medicine!
Please! You don't understand!

11:10.620 --> 11:12.899
You don't understand!

11:12.900 --> 11:15.979
Calm down. They're on it again!

11:15.980 --> 11:17.820
You've got to listen to me, please!

11:27.220 --> 11:29.260
You were right. It's Sean Howell.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.420
I've been right
about a lot of things.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.100
OK, I'm listening.

11:39.300 --> 11:43.459
There are people in this village,
a cult or a coven or...

11:43.460 --> 11:45.099
I don't know.

11:45.100 --> 11:49.219
I don't know what,
but the Satlows are in on it

11:49.220 --> 11:50.859
and so is Sylvia Walsh.

11:50.860 --> 11:55.219
Those reeltoreel recordings
up at Dean House, and the mirror,

11:55.220 --> 11:57.339
they use them for their ceremonies.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.819
And I think they also use children.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.459
You're talking about Carys Howell.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.059
They got hold of another one,
before.

12:05.060 --> 12:08.179
They adopted him from his drug
addicted mum,

12:08.180 --> 12:12.099
and I don't know what they did,
but he turned up dead

12:12.100 --> 12:13.859
and then they took Carys.

12:13.860 --> 12:17.539
OK. And now your mate, Mr Fine?

12:17.540 --> 12:20.620
They shut him up because he found
out something about Janice.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.620
He sent me pictures,
newspaper articles.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.779
Look.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.459
That's her.
She was a policewoman.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.779
And then she disappeared
and she changed her name

12:34.780 --> 12:37.499
and she left her whole life behind.
Now, why would she do that to me?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.499
Explain that.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.139
The Satlows are good people,
they're solid.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.020
Yeah, they're so bloody solid
that no one ever looks at them.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.860
All right, let's take a look.

13:09.740 --> 13:12.220
You stay back here
unless I call you in, all right?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.340
Did you know that she...?

13:45.260 --> 13:47.459
Matilda.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.099
Where's Hal?

13:49.100 --> 13:52.139
PC Graves was telling me
about your friend. I'm sorry.

13:52.140 --> 13:55.299
If you have hurt him, I will kill
you. I scarcely met the poor man.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.059
She's lying. You must be able to
see that!

13:58.060 --> 13:59.779
OK. Let's keep this civil.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.419
Apparently you also think I had

14:01.420 --> 14:03.619
something to do with
Carys going missing?

14:03.620 --> 14:06.659
You took me from my real mum.
Matilda! Away from my family.

14:06.660 --> 14:09.459
I was doing a shift at the hospital
when Carys disappeared,

14:09.460 --> 14:12.019
I clearly remember...
Then your husband took me!

14:12.020 --> 14:16.579
Matilda, may I ask have you been
taking the medication I prescribed?

14:16.580 --> 14:21.019
I think it would be enormously
beneficial if you did.

14:21.020 --> 14:25.659
David? They've got David Morgan
in there. That's right.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.459
Stephen Kendrick asked us
to mind him.

14:27.460 --> 14:31.179
We need to get him out of there.
Matilda, the boy looks fine. David!

14:31.180 --> 14:34.659
Come back! Excuse me!
Matilda! David, we need to go.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.059
We can go to the hospital
and we can see your mum.

14:37.060 --> 14:40.179
I'm warning you to step away.
Let go of the boy! You're crazy1.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.339
Hey, what the hell is going on?
I hate you!

14:43.340 --> 14:45.139
They are going to kill him.
I know it.

14:45.140 --> 14:48.379
Step back from that child or
I will restrain you. No! No!

14:48.380 --> 14:51.099
You can't have him. Drop that!
You said you would listen to me.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.779
David, come here.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.059
I can't believe I listened to you.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.979
They will hurt him.
Something is going to happen.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.019
You're a danger to this child
and you're a danger to yourself.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.979
You've got to listen!
You're not listening to me!

14:59.980 --> 15:02.499
Matilda Gray, I'm arresting you...
These people are killers!

15:02.500 --> 15:04.059
I know what they are planning.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.099
Harm your defence, if you fail to
mention...

15:06.100 --> 15:07.819
You've got to listen to me!

15:07.820 --> 15:09.900
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

16:00.620 --> 16:04.100
I said some hard things to him
before he went to Manchester.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.220
And now I feel like a right bitch.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.100
What if he doesn't come back?

16:36.340 --> 16:37.940
Can I sit with you?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.620
Till the police call?

17:44.100 --> 17:47.579
Inspector. Not any more, lad.

17:47.580 --> 17:51.899
Yeah. Sorry. Mr Kendrick.

17:51.900 --> 17:57.699
So... I heard your boss
arrested Miss Gray.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.540
Yeah, she had been troubling young
Davy Morgan again, so...

18:02.980 --> 18:04.860
Excuse me.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.020
Penllynith Police.
Constable Shortly speaking.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.099
OK, wait, wait. Calm down.

18:15.100 --> 18:18.020
And you can still hear them now?

18:19.860 --> 18:21.820
Right,
you must ring 999 immediately.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.859
Yes, we are the closest station,
but... Constable? One moment, ma'am.

18:26.860 --> 18:29.019
What's wrong? It's a lady
at the top of the Monmieth Road.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.699
Says someone's trying to break
into the back of her house.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.579
Well, get up there, man!
I can't leave a prisoner unattended.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.899
I'll attend.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.859
It's not procedure.
You want to risk it?

18:36.860 --> 18:39.659
I'll get on dispatch,
I'll get backup to Monmieth Road,

18:39.660 --> 18:41.380
you'll be back here in 30 minutes.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.140
Madam? Lock yourself
in the bathroom. I'll be there soon.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.540
Thank you, Inspector.
You're welcome. Now move!

19:46.980 --> 19:48.580
What's going on?

19:50.780 --> 19:52.580
Hello?

20:00.780 --> 20:02.420
Hello?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.260
Hello?

20:11.980 --> 20:15.579
Power's gone. So is the CCTV.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.419
We're in luck.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.939
Shortly's out, but he won't be
long. We've got to be quick.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.579
What are you doing?

20:21.580 --> 20:25.019
Matilda, I need your help
and I don't have anyone else to ask.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.060
Please. David's in danger.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.980
I know where he'll be.

20:35.980 --> 20:37.860
We need to go to Dean House.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.099
Coming.

20:42.100 --> 20:46.859
Hello? We had a callout. Yeah?
Someone trying to force entry?

20:46.860 --> 20:49.139
Not here. 52 Monmeith Road?

20:49.140 --> 20:51.819
I spoke to an older lady.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.739
This is 52
but there's no lady here.

20:54.740 --> 20:57.179
Just a crank call, then,
I expect.

20:57.180 --> 20:59.860
Must've been, I suppose.
Sorry to bother you.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.380
All right, Ben, all right.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.660
Benny! Benny!

22:22.660 --> 22:23.900
Stand up.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.940
Stand up or I will shoot.

22:49.260 --> 22:54.419
Verity Satlow treated Rose through
her depression. They were close.

22:54.420 --> 22:57.299
So, when the Satlows called up
and offered to mind David...

22:57.300 --> 23:00.700
You thought you could go down the
pub. I thought I could visit my son.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.140
He hasn't got long.

23:10.620 --> 23:14.139
I don't understand why you suddenly
believe me about all of this.

23:14.140 --> 23:17.379
I spoke to your friend Hal.
What?

23:17.380 --> 23:20.539
He asked me about a police officer
on the Carys Howell task force,

23:20.540 --> 23:22.459
Mary McKeown.

23:22.460 --> 23:23.860
Janice.

23:26.020 --> 23:29.979
I remember Mary, and I started
wondering if she might have

23:29.980 --> 23:32.459
figured this whole thing out.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.539
No. She kidnapped me.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.459
What if she rescued you?

23:37.460 --> 23:39.539
If she figured out where
they had you

23:39.540 --> 23:41.380
and snatched you away to save you?

23:43.060 --> 23:45.059
She would have told someone.

23:45.060 --> 23:47.220
She'd have told Rose at least.

23:50.380 --> 23:52.900
Maybe she didn't know
who she could trust.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.699
Those photos that she had of Rose.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.940
She thought Rose was in on it.

24:04.420 --> 24:07.179
And that's why she couldn't
give me back.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.659
Easy mistake to make.

24:08.660 --> 24:11.139
You made it yourself, didn't you?

24:11.140 --> 24:13.099
If she found out what
they have been doing,

24:13.100 --> 24:14.619
she would have been terrified.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.260
Enough to hide,
and stay hidden for 23 years.

24:19.180 --> 24:22.140
Maybe she actually saved your life,
Matilda.

24:33.660 --> 24:36.460
Best not to let them know
we're coming.

25:07.060 --> 25:10.619
If Mary was a policewoman
based around here,

25:10.620 --> 25:11.939
you would have been her boss.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.020
But you're saying
she never confided in you.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.219
She did, didn't she?

25:18.220 --> 25:20.539
I'd been warned about her.

25:20.540 --> 25:24.699
She was a wild card, a troublemaker,
so, at the time, what she said

25:24.700 --> 25:27.659
about people doing magic, it sounded
like the rantings of a mad woman.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.180
Well, she was right.

25:30.540 --> 25:33.420
She was right,
and she saved me from them.

25:37.420 --> 25:42.219
I told you I've made mistakes.
Now I'm trying to make up for them.

25:42.220 --> 25:43.540
Let's walk from here.

25:45.860 --> 25:47.500
It's only half a mile up the road.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.619
Nice to see you here at HQ, Graves.

26:03.620 --> 26:06.699
Are they putting something
in the water in Penllynith? Sorry?

26:06.700 --> 26:09.459
You've been having your own
mini crimewave.

26:09.460 --> 26:11.819
Maybe I'm just catching them
faster.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.739
Happy for you to have a casual chat.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.300
If you want to make it official,
give me a shout and I'll sit in.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.859
I want Kendrick.

26:31.860 --> 26:36.659
What? I know he was there at
Dean House the night Ewan Dean died.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.020
All I need to do
is connect him to the drugs.

26:41.420 --> 26:45.939
I expect there's hard men
involved in this drug deal of yours.

26:45.940 --> 26:50.099
But do you really think they will
care if you drop an excopper in it?

26:50.100 --> 26:51.739
What I'll guarantee you is this.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.619
You'll get a big
discount on your sentence

26:53.620 --> 26:55.739
if you help put a crooked police
officer away.

26:55.740 --> 26:58.219
Helps you, helps me.

26:58.220 --> 27:02.379
Helps your boy. So, I'll ask again.

27:02.380 --> 27:05.939
Was Stephen Kendrick involved in the
cultivation

27:05.940 --> 27:10.619
in the property adjacent
to Dean House? Not to my knowledge.

27:10.620 --> 27:14.739
So why was he there?
I don't know. He just showed up.

27:14.740 --> 27:16.859
And I thought I was a goner.
Old copper on the scene.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.339
But, no, he said to me, "If I don't
see you, you don't see me."

27:19.340 --> 27:22.179
Ed said he was cleaning up. He was.

27:22.180 --> 27:25.299
But it wasn't drugs,
it was broken glass.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.499
The way I see it,
Ewan Dean had been going about

27:27.500 --> 27:28.940
smashing up all the mirrors.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.099
Did Kendrick say anything about it?

27:33.100 --> 27:36.699
No. Tell you the truth,
he looked scared.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.819
At least until he turned
that damn noise off

27:38.820 --> 27:40.579
and then he just calmed down again.

27:40.580 --> 27:44.459
Noise? Music. If that's
what you want to call out.

27:44.460 --> 27:47.859
If you were bloody Igor!
Sent a shiver down my spine.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.900
But you know, each to his own.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.899
'This is Constable Ian Shortly.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.179
'Please leave a message
and I will get back to you.'

28:01.180 --> 28:02.899
Ian, I need to talk to Matilda Gray.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.380
I'm heading back into town
but it's urgent, so call me back.

28:22.820 --> 28:26.980
That Sylvia Walsh's car.
And the Satlows, they're here.

28:33.980 --> 28:37.660
This isn't right. Davie needs us.
I'm not going to wait.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.220
Tilly.

29:17.660 --> 29:18.820
Tilly.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.500
Matilda.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.260
Let's be friends.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.779
At first, I was running.

29:59.780 --> 30:02.020
Trying not to think
about what would happen.

30:04.260 --> 30:10.300
And then, one day, you were crying
again. You cried so much back then.

30:11.940 --> 30:16.700
And I... I lost it.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.500
I gave you a shake.

30:21.980 --> 30:26.140
And at that moment, I could see how
frightened you were.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.980
Of me.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.180
But still, later that night...

30:36.140 --> 30:40.019
you came into my bed...

30:40.020 --> 30:44.459
and you cuddled up to me,
to the scary lady,

30:44.460 --> 30:46.820
who'd shaken you.

30:49.340 --> 30:52.380
It's not something I asked for,
to be a mum.

30:55.260 --> 30:59.099
And you didn't ask
for me, either, I know.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.540
But you got me.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.500
And I did love you.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.020
I love my clever little girl.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.860
Did you love me, Tilly?

31:19.460 --> 31:21.420
Even a bit?

31:39.700 --> 31:41.819
What are you doing?

31:41.820 --> 31:45.020
The trap door down to the basement,
it's standing open.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.300
Light.

32:13.380 --> 32:16.180
There's a door here. What?

32:43.660 --> 32:45.779
And here you are.

32:45.780 --> 32:47.740
At last.

32:52.420 --> 32:54.459
It's OK. Where's Davey?

32:54.460 --> 32:56.859
Upstairs, asleep, safe.

32:56.860 --> 32:58.979
This was never about him.
Get out of my way!

32:58.980 --> 33:00.820
I will. Just calm down first.

33:02.820 --> 33:04.299
I'm sorry.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.699
It was important you came
of your own will...

33:06.700 --> 33:09.140
with pure heart.
To save the child.

33:11.740 --> 33:15.939
That's why things didn't
work out properly last time.

33:15.940 --> 33:17.739
When you were little.

33:17.740 --> 33:19.580
Pure of heart, you were.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.100
But not here willingly.

33:24.540 --> 33:26.819
Now we can put that right.

33:26.820 --> 33:30.859
Put that right?
You've killed people, children.

33:30.860 --> 33:32.979
You sent those things
to kill my mother.

33:32.980 --> 33:34.580
That woman wasn't your mother.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
Help! Matilda! Matilda!

34:08.139 --> 34:10.659
That boy...

34:10.659 --> 34:12.420
we buried near the caravan park.

34:13.860 --> 34:17.699
He did die,
but that was an accident.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.579
Too much sedative,

34:20.580 --> 34:24.460
and it forced us to take you,
instead and...

34:27.420 --> 34:29.980
I think you were
a far better choice.

34:34.580 --> 34:35.699
Sit up, Matilda.

34:39.820 --> 34:40.860
Sit up.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.780
You see...

34:48.020 --> 34:49.300
we need you.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.219
What are you going to do to me?

34:56.900 --> 34:58.739
Incredible things.

34:58.740 --> 35:01.339
She would have helped
my boy, Matilda.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.380
Take away the pain.

35:04.220 --> 35:06.140
You're mad.
She's done amazing things.

35:09.380 --> 35:11.619
I can make your dreams
come true, too.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.979
I don't want anything from you.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.659
You want to find out
who you really are,

35:16.660 --> 35:19.220
to solve the mystery of your past.
Isn't that true?

35:20.820 --> 35:24.300
There's... always been
something inside you.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.140
Like an itch you can't reach.

35:28.540 --> 35:31.820
Well, here's your chance
to scratch it.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.900
No.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.700
You're free to leave, if you want.

35:52.020 --> 35:53.060
But if you go...

35:54.340 --> 35:55.380
it's over.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.420
You'll never know the truth.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.580
Then there are
the criminal charges against you.

36:03.940 --> 36:08.140
Although Verity will recommend
you be sectioned instead and...

36:10.460 --> 36:14.980
even if you did escape that,
what would you be returning to?

36:16.580 --> 36:17.940
Your friend Hal...

36:18.940 --> 36:20.939
gone.

36:20.940 --> 36:21.980
Your career...

36:23.020 --> 36:24.739
gone.

36:24.740 --> 36:27.939
Your real mother, in a coma.

36:27.940 --> 36:29.420
You did that.

36:31.060 --> 36:33.300
You. You took it all from me.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.420
No, Matilda.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.660
You did it.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.419
All those things,

36:42.420 --> 36:44.500
you sacrificed them to get to here.

36:55.820 --> 36:56.940
The answer's in here.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.180
The answer to all your questions.

37:02.060 --> 37:03.780
An answer so incredible...

37:05.780 --> 37:06.980
you can't imagine.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.659
She's telling the truth, Matilda.

37:10.660 --> 37:11.700
I swear it.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.700
Here I am...

37:19.740 --> 37:22.220
You've burnt so many bridges
to get here.

37:23.420 --> 37:24.980
How could you back away now?

37:34.300 --> 37:36.020
Here I am...

40:20.580 --> 40:21.980
I can feel you.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.100
We can talk.

41:06.780 --> 41:08.700
I'm your...

41:11.460 --> 41:12.900
I'm...

41:16.340 --> 41:20.020
Here I am.

41:22.100 --> 41:26.780
Here I am.

41:29.860 --> 41:34.740
Here I am...

41:43.780 --> 41:44.820
Aargh!

41:45.940 --> 41:47.100
Argh...

43:35.060 --> 43:36.100
It's time.

43:37.500 --> 43:38.700
We need to get her out.

43:41.340 --> 43:44.819
Those things, are they inside her?

43:44.820 --> 43:48.820
Those things scuttling
around this house are nothing.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.300
Errand boys.

43:52.820 --> 43:54.500
What's in her is a great one.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.180
An Archangel.

43:58.700 --> 44:00.260
A shard of the divine.

44:02.380 --> 44:06.300
It been in her all the time,
just below the surface...

44:07.700 --> 44:09.780
unable to rise up to take control.

44:11.380 --> 44:14.820
All we've done is complete
what we started 23 years ago.

44:16.020 --> 44:18.019
We've released it,

44:18.020 --> 44:20.740
and I will stand on its right hand.

44:23.300 --> 44:24.460
We all will.

45:15.980 --> 45:17.419
She hasn't moved.

45:17.420 --> 45:19.860
I expect it'll take
a while for it to recover.

45:21.100 --> 45:22.579
To get used to being in control.

45:22.580 --> 45:23.620
Verity...

45:26.100 --> 45:29.140
Well, why don't you go
and check on the boy?

45:32.340 --> 45:33.380
Go.

45:42.620 --> 45:44.820
I think I'm going to be sick.
For heaven's sake.

45:45.940 --> 45:48.860
Why don't you make yourself useful,
and put the kettle on?

45:58.900 --> 46:01.979
Nicholas could soon
become a problem.

46:01.980 --> 46:03.180
He already is.

46:04.660 --> 46:05.700
As is your wife.

46:07.540 --> 46:11.019
I sorted Ewan out when he wouldn't
come back into the fold.

46:11.020 --> 46:13.580
I can quite easily
do the same with Verity.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.979
I...

46:16.980 --> 46:18.740
Lloyd.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.820
Cheer up.

46:24.300 --> 46:29.820
This is a happy day, not a sad one.

46:35.780 --> 46:37.939
Is he all right?

46:37.940 --> 46:40.300
I only gave him a mild dosage,
should be fine.

46:45.340 --> 46:47.540
Could something else
have crossed over?

47:03.660 --> 47:04.700
Who's there?

47:21.100 --> 47:22.140
Who's there?

47:25.180 --> 47:26.220
Hello?

47:39.620 --> 47:40.660
Stephen?

47:43.300 --> 47:44.660
Stephen!

48:02.420 --> 48:03.460
Matilda?

48:05.460 --> 48:06.660
Is it you?

48:11.500 --> 48:13.180
What I said before, it's true.

48:14.900 --> 48:16.379
I swear.

48:16.380 --> 48:17.900
I didn't want any of this.

48:19.860 --> 48:22.180
They forced me to.

48:24.740 --> 48:26.060
You know that, right?

49:07.860 --> 49:09.019
My God.

49:09.020 --> 49:11.539
Where have you...? What's happened?

49:11.540 --> 49:12.939
Matilda.

49:12.940 --> 49:15.979
It's too late. It's too late.

49:15.980 --> 49:19.139
OK.
OK, let's get you inside. Come on.

49:19.140 --> 49:20.420
Come on, it's OK.

49:24.340 --> 49:26.219
The power's out and
she's not in the lockup.

49:26.220 --> 49:28.300
I'm going to Dean House.
Meet me there.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.299
I'm sorry, boss. Inspector...

49:52.300 --> 49:55.259
I mean, Mr Kendrick, he said...
What's the situation here?

49:55.260 --> 49:57.820
I've been knocking but
there's no one answering.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.140
Bloody hell!

50:06.180 --> 50:08.179
Hello?

50:08.180 --> 50:09.899
You check the back.

50:09.900 --> 50:10.980
Hello?

50:25.900 --> 50:28.099
The trap door was opened
under that basement room

50:28.100 --> 50:29.300
but there's no one there.

50:32.420 --> 50:33.460
OK.

50:38.780 --> 50:39.820
Hello?

50:46.300 --> 50:47.340
Hello?

51:18.220 --> 51:20.900
I think David needs to see a doctor.

51:27.980 --> 51:30.859
Find out.

51:30.860 --> 51:33.460
Just check.

51:51.580 --> 51:53.419
They were wrong.

51:53.420 --> 51:54.500
You're OK.

51:56.860 --> 51:57.980
I think so.

51:59.820 --> 52:01.859
And you?

52:01.860 --> 52:03.579
I've had a shower now.

52:03.580 --> 52:04.740
I don't smell so.

52:15.020 --> 52:17.419
Will you come with me to see Rose?

52:17.420 --> 52:19.540
I can't. Not yet.

52:20.740 --> 52:21.980
You go for me.

52:25.340 --> 52:26.380
Go on.

52:55.340 --> 52:56.380
Hi.

52:58.020 --> 52:59.859
I'm sorry to intrude on you.

52:59.860 --> 53:02.539
You two probably want
some time alone, yeah?

53:02.540 --> 53:04.140
No, stay.

53:18.100 --> 53:19.780
I missed you.

53:22.220 --> 53:24.740
I missed you so much.

53:32.940 --> 53:35.580
Matilda? We do need to have a chat.

53:40.020 --> 53:41.860
I'll be back in a minute, OK?

53:50.500 --> 53:52.499
What's that for?

53:52.500 --> 53:53.780
I just wanted to.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.060
Still no sign of the Satlows...

54:13.220 --> 54:15.900
Sylvia Walsh, Nick Dean
or Stephen Kendrick.

54:16.980 --> 54:20.259
Even though all their cars
are up at Dean House.

54:20.260 --> 54:23.099
If I knew anything at all,
I would tell you.

54:23.100 --> 54:25.899
But, like I said, I don't remember.

54:25.900 --> 54:28.539
Do you know how convenient
that sounds?

54:28.540 --> 54:30.859
I've been having blackouts, OK?

54:30.860 --> 54:32.819
Check my medical records.

54:32.820 --> 54:35.659
The last thing I know from last
night, I was in your cells.

54:35.660 --> 54:39.819
Then you woke up at Dean House
and heard David upstairs crying.

54:39.820 --> 54:41.940
You've spoken to David.
What does he say?

54:43.100 --> 54:46.339
That the Satlows gave him
orange juice and he fell asleep.

54:46.340 --> 54:48.859
Next thing he knew,
he was with you at Dean House.

54:48.860 --> 54:50.540
Which is exactly what I told you.

54:52.260 --> 54:53.659
For now, I'm dropping the charges

54:53.660 --> 54:55.939
relating to what happened
at the Satlows'.

54:55.940 --> 54:57.939
But I am going to have
to interview you again

54:57.940 --> 54:59.619
about how you got
out of the lockup.

54:59.620 --> 55:02.420
I'm happy to do that, but as I said...
You don't remember anything.

55:06.780 --> 55:08.020
I'll be in touch.

55:09.305 --> 55:15.353
