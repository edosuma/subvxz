WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.800
No, no, no!

00:02.866 --> 00:04.966
Don't touch that dial.

00:05.033 --> 00:07.633
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.366 --> 00:12.900
A professor
running from his past

00:12.966 --> 00:15.833
a young student
running from his future

00:15.900 --> 00:18.433
and a terrifying vision
of their darkest fears.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.966
So, general,
our paths cross again.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.900
Have their nightmares
come alive?

00:22.966 --> 00:24.266
Die like a man.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.766
Or have they had
just one drink too many?

00:27.833 --> 00:31.266
Why, the bottle alone
can tear you apart.

00:31.333 --> 00:34.733
Find out on the next
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.266 --> 00:59.633
You're in Springwood now
and you're all mine.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.566
The only reason I'm taking
an English lit course is

01:26.633 --> 01:29.433
so I could stay away
from science professors.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.633
Why would you do that?

01:31.700 --> 01:34.333
I keep falling
in love with them.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.666
But I'm safe here.

01:35.733 --> 01:37.800
English professors
don't do anything for me.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.433
Oh, I hope
I'm not insulting you.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.933
You're not an English major?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.800
Uh, actually I'm a supervisor
at a credit rating service.

01:45.866 --> 01:48.400
I'm only taking this
one course on Shakespeare.

02:07.633 --> 02:10.133
Let's go..

02:13.133 --> 02:15.133
I thought you weren't
taking this course.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.766
I can take
whatever course I want.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.666
Since when have you been
interested in Shakespeare?

02:20.733 --> 02:23.300
I mean, the plots
of Saturday morning cartoons

02:23.366 --> 02:24.333
were too much for you.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.566
Oh, really?

02:25.633 --> 02:28.266
I saw "Othello" with Bob

02:28.333 --> 02:30.266
and I loved it.

02:30.333 --> 02:31.333
Ah!

02:32.433 --> 02:33.700
"Othello?"

02:33.766 --> 02:35.700
'How does that passage go?'

02:37.000 --> 02:39.033
"Pray, chuck, come hither

02:39.100 --> 02:40.200
show me your eyes."

02:54.100 --> 02:58.300
Shakespeare knew that
a good play was not enough.

02:58.366 --> 03:00.600
You had to get the audience
into the theater

03:00.666 --> 03:04.133
and then you had to grab
their attention.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.833
- 'What?'
- Oh!

03:05.900 --> 03:08.366
I think I'm in love.

03:08.433 --> 03:10.866
Bah! Yuck!

03:10.933 --> 03:12.866
A round of applause
for Mary Whittaker

03:12.933 --> 03:14.666
of our Theater Department.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.066
And I am Professor Windom

03:22.133 --> 03:24.666
and this is introduction
to Shakespeare.

03:24.733 --> 03:27.133
So, uh, let me introduce you.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.966
Class, this is
William Shakespeare.

03:31.033 --> 03:33.333
Willy, the class.

03:40.266 --> 03:42.133
Shakespeare survives

03:42.200 --> 03:44.966
because his plays
are as relatable today

03:45.033 --> 03:47.000
as when he first wrote them.

03:50.233 --> 03:51.400
Hmm.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.166
Would you like a belt, missy?

03:55.233 --> 03:57.366
Looks like it would
make you feel good.

03:57.433 --> 03:58.933
Uh, no.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.366
Little missy

04:03.433 --> 04:06.000
Springwood Yew is very small.

04:06.066 --> 04:09.100
Now you can learn
real drama from me

04:09.166 --> 04:11.800
or go on believing
that "Jake And The Fatman"

04:11.866 --> 04:13.366
works on a number of levels.

04:15.433 --> 04:16.633
Eh?

04:18.733 --> 04:21.133
He is the most fascinating man
I've ever met.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.400
Definitely, if you're
into burned-out drunks.

04:24.466 --> 04:26.700
All artistic types
drink a little.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.300
A little?
This guy downed a quart.

04:30.366 --> 04:32.733
I've got it.
I'll ask him to tutor me.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.400
I bet you I have a date
by the second lesson.

04:34.466 --> 04:35.633
Oh!

04:35.700 --> 04:37.366
'You must believe me.'

04:37.433 --> 04:40.600
You're wrong to think
that poetry is worthless.

04:41.766 --> 04:43.733
'Poetry must not
only be allowed..'

04:45.966 --> 04:47.900
...it must be nurtured.

05:03.066 --> 05:06.733
So you don't think
booze can kill ya, huh?

05:09.066 --> 05:12.833
Why, the bottle alone
can tear you apart.

05:14.066 --> 05:16.566
But booze ain't gonna
kill the professor.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.800
He's just gonna wish it did.

05:27.833 --> 05:28.766
Oh!

05:28.833 --> 05:30.400
Oh!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.433
Ooh!

05:46.233 --> 05:48.900
Professor, it's me, Chuck.

05:48.966 --> 05:51.300
- Chuck.
- Chuck?

05:51.366 --> 05:52.700
Chuck!

05:52.766 --> 05:55.366
I didn't recognize you.

05:55.433 --> 05:56.900
Come in.

05:56.966 --> 05:59.200
P-professor, I need your help.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.933
What is it? Are you in trouble?

06:05.733 --> 06:08.733
Professor,
you-you gotta hide me.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.966
Tell me what's going on.

06:10.033 --> 06:12.533
It's the army.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.966
I-I couldn't take anymore.
I wish I could, but I couldn't.

06:15.033 --> 06:18.100
I..
Look, I-I-I deserted.

06:18.166 --> 06:21.566
You deserted? Do you
know how serious that is?

06:21.633 --> 06:23.566
Oh, no, professor,
I've just been running

06:23.633 --> 06:26.133
for the past two days
to prepare for a marathon.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.633
Well, what are you going to do?

06:28.700 --> 06:30.600
You can't stay here.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.033
Why not?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.166
That would make me an accessory
to your crime.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.000
I'm not gonna do that now.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.666
Have you tried to contact
your family?

06:38.733 --> 06:41.300
What? Are you kidding?
Do you know my family?

06:41.366 --> 06:44.366
They-they've been in army
since Valley Forge.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.200
I can't go there.

06:46.266 --> 06:47.833
God!

06:47.900 --> 06:49.400
Look, there..

06:49.466 --> 06:51.433
There's somethin' else too,
professor.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.066
What?

06:53.133 --> 06:55.833
I've been havin'
these awful nightmares.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.633
It's time to get
what you deserve, boy.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.766
Wait!

07:07.766 --> 07:09.200
No!

07:12.733 --> 07:14.000
Dad.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.066
- Lower the club, soldier.
- Yes, sir!

07:19.133 --> 07:21.700
'You were going to hit him
in the face, weren't you?'

07:23.266 --> 07:26.033
That's wrong. Real wrong.

07:28.066 --> 07:29.900
- Hit him in the stomach!
- 'No!'

07:29.966 --> 07:31.600
That way
no one will see the mark.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.833
No! No!

07:36.300 --> 07:39.566
The meaning of your dream's
pretty clear to me.

07:39.633 --> 07:43.100
It's an expression of the guilt
you feel over your desertion.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.366
No, it's more than that.
Don't you understand?

07:45.433 --> 07:47.500
I don't think the nightmares
will stop until you--

07:47.566 --> 07:48.833
Until what?

07:48.900 --> 07:51.033
U-until I turn myself in?

07:51.100 --> 07:53.233
Don't you realize
they'll kill me if I go back?

07:53.300 --> 07:54.500
Oh, I don't..

07:54.566 --> 07:56.200
I think the army
will treat you fair.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.066
Yeah, yeah, it's not..

07:58.133 --> 08:00.366
No, it's not the army
I'm worried about.

08:00.433 --> 08:03.133
It's, it's my father
who'd want me dead.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.766
Well, he's not the only person
in your life.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.433
- What about Janie?
- It's Jeanie.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.866
Oh, what kind of life
can I offer her?

08:10.933 --> 08:12.900
God! Professor, I beg you.

08:12.966 --> 08:15.133
Please let me stay.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.300
Alright, alright.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.466
Okay, Chuck.
We'll see what we can do.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.866
Oh. Thank you.

08:27.866 --> 08:31.800
So, general,
our paths cross again.

08:33.800 --> 08:37.033
This time to do battle
over the soul of your own son.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.300
- No!
- Easy

08:59.233 --> 09:00.933
Don't be afraid.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.233
I've come to tell you
that I was wrong.

09:07.466 --> 09:10.166
Wrong? How?

09:10.233 --> 09:12.366
You don't have to be like me.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.833
You shouldn't be like me.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.166
And the fact that
you've been fighting so hard

09:17.233 --> 09:21.000
to be your own man shows me
that you've got guts.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.733
Thanks, dad.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.800
This calls for a drink.

09:28.866 --> 09:30.633
Dad, no,
you don't need to drink.

09:30.700 --> 09:34.100
That's what I've been telling
you and your mother for years.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.533
No, I'm begging you,
don't drink.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.233
One never hurt anybody.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.033
Ah!

09:52.266 --> 09:54.533
You little wimp!

10:06.733 --> 10:09.433
D-daddy, please. Please.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.066
Don't worry.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.600
I won't let them hang you.

10:13.666 --> 10:17.733
But only because hanging
is too good for you.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.533
Shoot him in the knees!

10:19.600 --> 10:21.333
No! No!

10:22.566 --> 10:23.833
And I scream and I scream

10:23.900 --> 10:26.033
and the MPs just laugh.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.666
And they drop me to the floor
and that's it.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.200
Then I woke up.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.866
You said this dream
makes you more nervous

10:32.933 --> 10:34.333
than the others. Why is that?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.533
It took place in Springwood

10:36.600 --> 10:38.533
right in this apartment.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.933
They're closing in on me--

10:41.000 --> 10:43.300
No, they are not.
It's just a dream.

10:48.633 --> 10:51.100
- You're lookin' pretty good.
- Hmm? Oh!

10:51.166 --> 10:54.633
Thanks.
I'm feeling good too.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.633
You know, I'm drinking less.

10:57.666 --> 10:59.133
I'm happy for you.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.400
Look, I've got to go
over some papers

11:01.466 --> 11:03.466
so excuse me
for a little while, okay?

11:03.533 --> 11:05.500
Sure, no problem.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.566
Did you think about me?

11:11.633 --> 11:13.500
About what will happen
when the MPs arrive?

11:13.566 --> 11:16.966
- Yes, I think about that.
- Oh, really?

11:17.033 --> 11:19.833
Then why do we just sit around
in this apartment?

11:19.900 --> 11:21.833
Why aren't we doing something?
Going somewhere?

11:21.900 --> 11:24.633
Listen, Chuck,
your future is on my mind

11:24.700 --> 11:26.733
but, but it's not running away.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.733
Look.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.433
It's this.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.733
This is one of my poems.

11:38.466 --> 11:41.133
- You've kept it.
- I kept it because it's good.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.100
It's really good.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.333
I wish my father
felt like you did.

11:46.833 --> 11:50.433
Maybe if I called him and told
him how good you really are.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.966
Oh, no. No, to my father,
all poetry is the same.

11:54.033 --> 11:55.966
It should all be written
by women.

11:56.033 --> 11:59.266
Listen, Chuck,
you have got to trust me.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.800
Now I'm waiting for word
on something.

12:00.866 --> 12:03.733
When I get that word,
we're gonna move quickly, okay?

12:08.600 --> 12:09.633
Okay.

12:11.366 --> 12:14.033
Now will you let me do my work?

12:15.466 --> 12:16.733
Alright, professor.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.333
I-I'm sorry
I'm such a trouble.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.800
No, no.
Don't worry about it.

12:24.733 --> 12:27.300
- I think I'll do some writing.
- That's a good idea.

12:30.233 --> 12:33.666
Uh, I, I just remembered
I-I misplaced my notebook.

12:33.733 --> 12:35.433
Did you see it?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.400
What is it?

12:39.666 --> 12:41.133
We always used to
make fun of you

12:41.200 --> 12:43.233
because you misplaced things.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.866
Oh, that.

12:44.933 --> 12:46.466
'But I-I've never done that.'

12:46.533 --> 12:47.533
So?

12:49.133 --> 12:50.233
Nothing.

13:08.666 --> 13:10.833
Well, what are you all
stating at?

13:10.900 --> 13:13.566
Never seen a guy who's had
areally&lt;TO

13:15.866 --> 13:18.200
Today we're gonna finish
our discussion of "Lear."

13:18.266 --> 13:20.533
Now, Barbara.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.300
'Could you tell me
the difference'

13:24.366 --> 13:25.600
between the subplot in "Lear"

13:25.666 --> 13:27.633
and Shakespeare's
other subplots?

13:30.766 --> 13:33.033
I don't know.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.933
How come you're asking
a question like that?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.500
Well, this may come
as a surprise to you, Barbara

13:38.566 --> 13:41.700
but I ask the questions
because I am a teacher.

13:43.033 --> 13:44.933
'Now you are a student'

13:45.000 --> 13:48.166
'so therefore,
you answer the questions.'

13:48.233 --> 13:50.700
But you never asked
any questions before.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.066
Is that so?

13:54.133 --> 13:56.233
Well, that's all changed.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.700
Don't blame me.
It's the suit.

14:03.766 --> 14:06.400
I am an animal
when I wear this suit.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.233
Chuck.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.366
Chuck, where are ya?

14:15.433 --> 14:17.400
'I'm in the bathroom.'

14:18.766 --> 14:22.233
Listen, the news I've
been waiting for, it's come.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.666
'I'll be out in a minute.'

14:23.733 --> 14:25.966
I'm gonna be heading
the English Lit Department

14:26.033 --> 14:28.300
of Bern University
in Switzerland.

14:28.366 --> 14:30.666
I've always dreamed
of something like this

14:30.733 --> 14:32.600
but I kinda got side tracked

14:32.666 --> 14:35.000
by, uh, well, you know.

14:35.066 --> 14:37.900
But now I've got it
and you're coming with me.

14:37.966 --> 14:39.900
You're gonna
get a second chance.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.900
A chance to pursue your poetry.

14:41.966 --> 14:45.633
All in a place outside
the army's jurisdiction.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.733
Who knows? Maybe Jeanie
can come over later.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.233
'Sounds great.'

14:51.300 --> 14:55.000
Listen, I've saved
the best part for last.

14:55.066 --> 14:58.433
I've stopped drinking.
Do you believe it?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.366
I just stopped.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.833
This afternoon
I said "No more."

15:23.766 --> 15:25.933
That's right, Chuck,
we're almost packed.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.100
I've got the tickets to Canada,
our connection is to London

15:29.166 --> 15:31.933
with a short detour
to Stratford-on-Avon.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.800
We can overlook
Shakespeare's home

15:33.866 --> 15:37.000
and then, on to Bern,
our new home.

15:43.700 --> 15:47.200
What is it?
What's so funny?

15:47.266 --> 15:50.800
We're not gonna make it.
It's all a waste of time.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.533
The MP's are too close.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.533
How could you
possibly know that?

16:00.066 --> 16:01.666
Because I can feel it.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.166
And if you weren't
such a pathetic

16:03.233 --> 16:04.300
hopeless drunkard
trying to--

16:04.366 --> 16:05.900
Now, hold it, hold it.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.500
You've forgotten.
I don't drink anymore.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.500
Oh, right.
Right!

16:12.566 --> 16:14.366
You know, I finally
figured out the deal.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.600
- What deal?
- Why you took me in.

16:16.666 --> 16:18.633
What are you talking about

16:20.033 --> 16:22.033
You've been usin' me
to build yourself up.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.700
And you've done it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.933
You won't be taking me along.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.933
I am taking you!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.533
I've shown you the tickets

16:35.600 --> 16:38.233
I promise you,
you're coming along.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.200
You're a liar.

16:44.266 --> 16:46.233
Chuck, please.

16:54.933 --> 16:57.166
Better start taking
these bags down.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.500
Taxi will be here soon.

16:59.566 --> 17:01.533
We're really goin', huh?

17:01.600 --> 17:05.300
Yes. Yes, we're really going.

17:05.366 --> 17:07.300
Come on.

17:23.766 --> 17:26.333
- What is it?
- My father's here.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.100
The general, here?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.800
I told you we wouldn't make it.

17:30.866 --> 17:31.833
Wait a minute,
wait, wait, wait.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.966
Maybe you just imagined
you saw him.

17:34.033 --> 17:36.100
Imagine? I just saw
the staff car pull up.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.100
I'd know it anywhere.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.400
Chuck, it's just the cab.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.666
You idiot,
you don't have a clue.

17:50.733 --> 17:52.866
I'm warning you,
don't let him get me.

17:52.933 --> 17:56.300
I won't, I won't.
Listen, go hide in the bedroom.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.733
When' it's clear for us
to leave, I'll let you know.

18:05.366 --> 18:06.966
We'll be down in a minute.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.300
Alright.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.033
You are here. I-I..

18:21.100 --> 18:23.233
Where's my son?

18:23.300 --> 18:26.033
You leave him alone, you've
done him enough harm already.

18:26.100 --> 18:29.900
Oh, is that so?
Where is the kid?

18:29.966 --> 18:31.066
You can't have him!

18:31.133 --> 18:33.333
And who's going
to stop me? You?

18:35.033 --> 18:38.433
Now you tell me where
he is before I get angry!

18:38.500 --> 18:39.966
He's in the bedroom.

18:40.033 --> 18:41.566
Uh, you coward!

18:41.633 --> 18:43.900
Look who's talking.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.166
No.

18:47.233 --> 18:50.800
Believe me,
you're better off dead.

18:51.966 --> 18:53.933
No-o!

18:55.166 --> 18:56.800
Chuck?

18:56.866 --> 19:00.733
Little Chuck.
You lousy coward!

19:00.800 --> 19:02.766
Stop your whining.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.933
The least you can do
is die like a man.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.433
Don't listen to him, Chuck.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.500
Oh, we almost made it.

19:12.566 --> 19:15.033
Switzerland would've-would've
been nice.

19:20.266 --> 19:22.233
What's happening?

19:23.366 --> 19:25.533
I-I must be going mad.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.800
Chuck, stop this gibberish.

19:28.866 --> 19:31.233
Stand up and face your father!

19:34.000 --> 19:36.500
'Professor Charles Windom.'

19:36.566 --> 19:39.833
'The great literary mind.'

19:39.900 --> 19:42.366
My, my.

19:42.433 --> 19:45.800
They may be impressed
with you at the university

19:45.866 --> 19:49.600
but you're still
just my son Chuck to me.

19:50.466 --> 19:52.300
'Nothing but a coward.'

19:52.366 --> 19:54.300
'And a deserter.'

19:55.633 --> 19:57.300
But, dad..

19:58.000 --> 19:59.933
...that was so long ago.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.300
Can't you forgive me now?

20:07.766 --> 20:09.733
When you deserted..

20:10.666 --> 20:12.600
...it killed me.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.133
That's not true.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.900
My desertion had nothing
to do with your death.

20:20.933 --> 20:22.900
Are you sure?

20:28.033 --> 20:30.000
Are you sure?

21:39.533 --> 21:42.233
What are you two doing here?

21:42.300 --> 21:43.466
Uh..

21:43.533 --> 21:46.600
The-the office told us
that if you're, uh..

21:46.666 --> 21:49.400
If the-they were closed we
could come to your apartment.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.433
Yes, but what do you want?

21:55.166 --> 21:58.833
Uh, Jeanie wanted
to know if you'll tutor her.

22:00.266 --> 22:03.300
And who are you?
Her interpreter?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.866
I just came by because
she's a little nervous.

22:07.933 --> 22:09.900
Oh, a little nervous, huh?

22:13.033 --> 22:15.000
Professor, I could
use your help.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.900
My help?

22:18.866 --> 22:21.433
I doubt it, Jeanie.

22:22.733 --> 22:25.233
I can barely help myself.

22:27.833 --> 22:30.600
I'm...sorry.

23:13.466 --> 23:15.700
Professor Windom,
it's me, Chuck.

23:15.766 --> 23:16.900
Chuck.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.533
Chuck? Chuck!

23:19.600 --> 23:21.533
I didn't recognize you.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.366
Come in.

23:24.433 --> 23:26.400
Professor,
I need your help.

23:27.833 --> 23:30.100
What is it?
Are you in trouble?

23:32.533 --> 23:34.900
Professor,
yo-you gotta hide me.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.033
Tell me..

23:40.033 --> 23:42.000
...what's going on?

23:45.600 --> 23:48.833
Here, I'm the head of class.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.200
And the professor is a dunce.

23:51.266 --> 23:53.566
His punishment?

23:53.633 --> 23:56.500
He has to relive
that 10,000 times.

23:57.766 --> 23:59.633
Or until he dies.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.733
Whichever comes first.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.233
This is the city of Springwood.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.633
It was 9:01 a.m.,
I was working security beat

24:09.700 --> 24:11.266
at Computer Credit
headquarters.

24:11.333 --> 24:14.300
I carry a 30 meg hard drive
and a full complement of RAM.

24:14.366 --> 24:16.166
I know, I'm a computer.

24:16.233 --> 24:17.800
I was interfacing
with a cute little Mac

24:17.866 --> 24:19.433
next doorwhen I got the call.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.600
It was a hot tip
from one F.Krueger.

24:21.666 --> 24:23.500
Always a reliable source.

24:23.566 --> 24:25.233
The case involved one
Millie Hanson

24:25.300 --> 24:26.933
and her supervisor
Barbara Parton.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.900
One of them wasdirty,
one was clean.

24:28.966 --> 24:30.866
My job, to find out
which was which.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.366
Millie, I'll take care
of the customers.

24:37.433 --> 24:39.433
I want you to keep working
on the new programs

24:39.500 --> 24:41.500
for the computer.

24:41.566 --> 24:43.500
Alright, but you should learn
them too, Barbara.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.533
There are lot of
new things going on.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.733
I don't have to learn them
I have you.

24:54.566 --> 24:57.033
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.200
I was late
with one mortgage payment

24:59.266 --> 25:01.666
now I'm being turned down
for credit cards.

25:01.733 --> 25:05.566
I'm sorry. Computer credit
is a credit rating service

25:05.633 --> 25:07.866
We rate them as we see them.

25:07.933 --> 25:09.300
Your best bet is simply

25:09.366 --> 25:11.900
not to apply
for credit cards.

25:11.966 --> 25:15.100
There's nothing I can do.
There's nothing I can do.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.933
There's nothing I can do.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.600
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

25:18.666 --> 25:21.166
But your computer
lost my payment record

25:21.233 --> 25:24.433
and because it did
I'm going to lose my car.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.033
I recommend you make
the payments again

25:27.100 --> 25:28.766
and when the computer
discovers that you've

25:28.833 --> 25:30.400
paid twice,
you'll be credited.

25:30.466 --> 25:32.866
I can't afford
six more payments.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.766
That's not my problem.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.866
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

25:36.933 --> 25:37.933
No.

25:40.666 --> 25:42.866
Listen, I'm not promising
anything, but if you write down

25:42.933 --> 25:44.900
your loan number,
I'll see what I can do.

25:46.633 --> 25:49.033
You are very nice.
Thank you.

25:51.733 --> 25:55.333
Give me the number.
I'll look into it.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.966
- But I-I--
- But nothing, Millie.

25:57.033 --> 25:59.000
I run the department.

26:16.966 --> 26:20.633
You say you got credit problems,
huh? Need some help?

26:20.700 --> 26:24.033
Just call me.
I can kill the bill collectors.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.866
I can kill the lawyers.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.533
And if that doesn't work

26:27.600 --> 26:29.900
I'll put you out of your misery.

26:35.266 --> 26:36.833
Hello?

26:36.900 --> 26:38.000
Oh, hi, mom.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.400
Fine. What's up?

26:43.033 --> 26:44.033
Mother.

26:46.533 --> 26:48.566
I can't change
your credit file

26:48.633 --> 26:50.900
every time
you over extend yourself.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.600
Hat? What hat?

26:56.133 --> 26:58.366
Mother, just because you want
a hat doesn't mean that I can--

27:01.200 --> 27:04.800
Alright.

27:04.866 --> 27:07.166
Alright.
I'll take care of it.

27:08.366 --> 27:09.700
Yes.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.333
Love you too. Bye.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.266
It didn't take long
to find out who was dirty.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.900
The question now,
clean her up or run her in?

27:17.966 --> 27:20.900
- What is it, Millie?
- It's not fair, Barbara.

27:20.966 --> 27:22.466
What's not fair?

27:22.533 --> 27:25.200
You won't help people with
real problems, but your mother--

27:25.266 --> 27:27.200
My mother is not your concern.

27:28.266 --> 27:31.400
Changing someone's
files is wrong.

27:31.466 --> 27:34.666
Millie, you better decide
if you work for the customers

27:34.733 --> 27:35.966
or if you work for me.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.933
Otherwise, you're gonna be
an assistant forever.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.933
'You understand?'

27:41.600 --> 27:44.900
Millie.
I don't dislike your ethics.

27:44.966 --> 27:46.933
I find them refreshing.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.900
But you shouldn't apply
them to the work place.

27:51.533 --> 27:53.200
She knew I was the only one
who could catch her

27:53.266 --> 27:54.900
so Iplayed on those fears.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.200
Barbara Parton you are under
arrest for computer tampering.

28:02.266 --> 28:04.666
What?

28:04.733 --> 28:06.033
You have the right
to remain silent.

28:06.100 --> 28:08.133
You have the right
to an attorney.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.666
I'll get off with two hours of
community service, you'll see.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.300
This is crazy.

28:13.366 --> 28:14.866
How can I get 25 years

28:14.933 --> 28:17.233
in a maximum
security prison?

28:17.300 --> 28:18.333
When are you gonna catch on

28:18.400 --> 28:21.400
that computer tampering
is a serious offence?

28:21.466 --> 28:24.833
Oh, give me a break.
I was just doing it for my mom.

28:24.900 --> 28:27.233
Yeah, well, it's little late
for that kind of talk.

28:28.966 --> 28:31.966
Now! Sit down!

28:32.033 --> 28:35.833
If I were you,
I'd be thinking about survival.

28:35.900 --> 28:39.633
Especially,
with the roommate you got.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.366
So, you're the new fish, huh?

28:41.433 --> 28:43.166
Quite a morsel, ain't ya?

28:43.233 --> 28:45.533
If you wanna live,
you better be nice to me.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.533
No, no.

28:49.766 --> 28:52.100
Get me out of here, please.
Please.

28:52.166 --> 28:54.800
Barbara, what are you saying,
Barbara? Get you out of what?

28:56.033 --> 28:58.000
Uh, nothing, Millie.

28:59.266 --> 29:00.300
Nothing.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.766
In my line of work,
you expect the unexpected.

29:16.833 --> 29:18.833
Enter one Joe Boyett,
love interest.

29:21.633 --> 29:24.066
'I'm about to apply
for a small business loan.'

29:24.133 --> 29:27.133
A few months ago a plumber did
some unacceptable work for me.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.866
I refuse to pay him,
the bill wasn't much

29:28.933 --> 29:31.400
but I wound up losing
my AAA credit rating.

29:31.466 --> 29:32.800
You should have paid him.

29:32.866 --> 29:34.200
I know.

29:34.266 --> 29:36.600
Is there anything I can do
now to set it straight?

29:36.666 --> 29:37.733
Nothing.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.566
The computer
won't even consider

29:39.633 --> 29:42.066
changing it
for another three months.

29:42.133 --> 29:44.766
I knew you're gonna
say that.

29:44.833 --> 29:46.266
'That's Romeo and Juliet.'

29:46.333 --> 29:49.500
Yes. How did you know?

29:49.566 --> 29:51.533
Are you familiar
with these medallions?

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
Yes.

29:53.766 --> 29:56.033
I have a secret obsession
for Shakespeare.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.533
Me too.
I adore him.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.000
I just adore him.

30:03.066 --> 30:05.100
His plays are
my only respite from

30:05.166 --> 30:08.833
the harsh realities
of a too cruel world.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.966
He'll never buy that line.

30:11.033 --> 30:13.900
It's so rare to find someone
who shares my passion.

30:13.966 --> 30:15.900
He bought it.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.533
Could we have dinner tonight?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.433
What time do you get off?

30:20.500 --> 30:23.800
Oh, please.
We've just met.

30:26.933 --> 30:29.733
Some people have all the fun.
Me? I work.

30:58.366 --> 31:00.166
I take it you agreed
to dinner.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.333
- Yes.
- And was it?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.266
Was it ever.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.100
And did he..

31:06.166 --> 31:07.966
Like a God.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.033
Wow.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.766
So, when are you
going out again?

31:12.833 --> 31:16.100
I don't know.
I'm sure he'll call.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.300
Oh, I wouldn't wait for that.
I'd call him.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.266
I know you would, Millie.

31:21.333 --> 31:24.300
Well, at least call and let him
know you had a good time.

31:24.366 --> 31:25.733
'Maybe give him something
to let him know'

31:25.800 --> 31:27.533
'you appreciated last night.'

31:28.600 --> 31:30.633
I could buy him something.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.033
No, it would be better
to do something special

31:33.100 --> 31:35.400
like-like cooking dinner.
Men love that.

31:36.566 --> 31:38.900
No, it'll have to be
something else.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.433
I can't cook.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.566
Like I always say "Learn how
to cook, stay out of jail."

31:45.633 --> 31:48.500
No, I couldn't take it out
of your files

31:48.566 --> 31:50.433
so I put all kinds
of good things in

31:50.500 --> 31:53.700
so the computer will kick it
back up to AAA rating again.

31:54.733 --> 31:56.700
Oh, things like paid up

31:56.766 --> 31:59.433
department store accounts,
bank credit lines.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.900
Oh, no. Of course
no one will find out.

32:02.966 --> 32:05.033
After all I run the department.

32:06.766 --> 32:08.733
What? Lunch?

32:09.866 --> 32:12.833
At our restaurant.
Sure.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.300
One o'clock.
Fine.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.400
Bye.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.066
I'll bet he went out with me

32:42.133 --> 32:44.733
just so that
I would change his file.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.900
Millie, would you
do me a favor?

32:50.966 --> 32:53.700
Could you go to accounting
and get the quarterly reports?

32:54.600 --> 32:55.600
Sure, Barbara.

33:01.733 --> 33:03.533
Well, lover boy

33:03.600 --> 33:05.833
you're about to have
the worst credit ratings

33:05.900 --> 33:08.100
since Germany lost
World War II.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.766
Joe.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.233
I-I thought..

33:23.300 --> 33:25.500
'Barbara, I've come
to apologize about lunch.'

33:25.566 --> 33:27.600
Oh, that's not necessary.

33:27.666 --> 33:29.966
Yes, it is.
And I'm sorry.

33:30.033 --> 33:31.266
My mother suddenly
got very sick

33:31.333 --> 33:33.300
and I had to take her
to the hospital.

33:33.366 --> 33:34.600
Is she alright?

33:34.666 --> 33:37.833
She's fine now,
uh, turned out to be nothing.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.866
But I should have called.

33:39.933 --> 33:43.433
I understand. I'm just glad
that your mother is alright.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.033
You know, you're really
a very special person.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.833
Most women wouldn't
have been so forgiving.

33:50.900 --> 33:54.333
That's my nature. I'm just
not the vindictive type.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.000
Oh, no.

33:58.066 --> 33:59.400
What is it?

33:59.466 --> 34:00.866
When I thought
you stood me up

34:00.933 --> 34:03.300
I sort of did things
to your credit file.

34:03.966 --> 34:05.600
Things?
Like what?

34:05.666 --> 34:07.833
Like totally wrecked it.

34:07.900 --> 34:11.000
Joe, I was angry.
I'm so sorry.

34:11.066 --> 34:12.433
Well, change it back.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.466
That's the problem. I can't.
It's locked in.

34:15.533 --> 34:17.433
But we could have
dinner tonight.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.666
And I'd cook you
something really special

34:19.733 --> 34:21.466
and then we could
talk about it.

34:21.533 --> 34:23.566
Dinner tonight?
You gotta be out of your mind.

34:23.633 --> 34:25.533
I don't wanna
see you again!

34:45.933 --> 34:47.900
Barbara, help.
Get me out of here.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Who are you?

34:52.066 --> 34:54.300
Joe? Is that you?

34:54.366 --> 34:56.733
- Yes.
- Joe.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.933
How can I help?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.233
- Come get me.
- Come get you?

35:00.300 --> 35:01.600
How?

35:10.100 --> 35:11.766
Kids, don't try this at home.

35:29.266 --> 35:30.233
Barbara.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.533
What is that?

35:35.600 --> 35:38.833
Credit updates going to files
and if you think that's painful

35:38.900 --> 35:41.166
you should see what it's like
when it's your file.

35:41.233 --> 35:43.933
You've got to help me.
My boyfriend's in danger.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.300
He's trapped in here.

35:45.366 --> 35:47.933
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.900
Didn't you hear me?
He's in danger.

35:49.966 --> 35:51.400
We've gotta get him
out of here.

35:51.466 --> 35:53.266
What kind of people are you?

35:53.333 --> 35:55.300
We aren't people.

35:56.366 --> 35:58.200
We're numbers in a computer.

35:59.466 --> 36:03.366
Please, make her stop.
She's killing me.

36:03.433 --> 36:06.033
I would like to,
but she's programed that way.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.300
However, if you can wait
three months..

36:14.933 --> 36:17.100
'Barbara, over here,
just a little further.'

36:18.900 --> 36:19.900
Joe!

36:21.900 --> 36:23.833
Barbara, help.
Get me out of here.

36:25.633 --> 36:28.000
Maybe I can delete
the glass casing.

36:28.066 --> 36:30.000
Somehow erase it
from the memory.

36:34.700 --> 36:38.133
There. That should do it.
It will disappear now.

36:39.666 --> 36:40.633
'Joe!'

36:42.833 --> 36:45.000
No. What went wrong?

36:45.066 --> 36:47.900
You'd know if you kept up
with the latest advances.

36:47.966 --> 36:49.633
Oh, shut up!

36:49.700 --> 36:51.033
Joe!

36:51.100 --> 36:52.100
No!

36:55.833 --> 36:57.300
She was definitely
losing her grip.

36:57.366 --> 36:59.100
All I could do was wait
for her next move

36:59.166 --> 37:01.200
and hope it would be
the wrong one.

37:06.366 --> 37:08.500
Thanks for meeting me.

37:08.566 --> 37:10.300
You were so upset,
it was hard to refuse.

37:11.566 --> 37:14.500
But nothing's changed.
You destroyed my credit rating.

37:15.766 --> 37:17.233
I still don't get it.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.700
Why can't you just take
the entries out?

37:19.766 --> 37:21.033
I can't.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.833
Taking things out, deletin
bad credit can't be done

37:23.900 --> 37:26.500
without using
a personal code.

37:26.566 --> 37:28.900
So, use your personal code.

37:28.966 --> 37:31.533
There's a chance I'd get caught
and then I'd go to jail.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.533
Is there someone else's code
you can use?

37:38.700 --> 37:42.066
The only other code
I know is...Millie's.

37:46.600 --> 37:50.100
Barbara...I don't wanna bring
any harm to Millie..

37:51.500 --> 37:53.866
...but you've gotta do it.

37:53.933 --> 37:55.900
For my business.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.200
And for us.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.333
Barbara, I have strong
feelings for you.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.300
If you can just take this
roadblock out of our lives.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.833
Hello, Joe.
It's me Barbara.

38:34.133 --> 38:36.733
Yes, I did it.
I changed it back.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.233
Uh-huh, I used Millie's code.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.533
But's it's 9:20
and she's not in yet.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.066
What if she doesn't
come in today?

38:44.133 --> 38:46.333
I'm the only other person
that knows her code and

38:46.400 --> 38:48.333
they'll know it's me.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.766
No, I can't just put
the information back.

38:51.833 --> 38:54.200
It's too late for that.
What do I do?

38:57.866 --> 39:00.166
You're right.
You're right.

39:00.233 --> 39:03.600
She's probably just late,
otherwise she would've called.

39:04.866 --> 39:06.700
Thank you, Joe.

39:06.766 --> 39:08.900
Uh-huh.
Bye.

39:17.633 --> 39:19.066
Hello?

39:19.133 --> 39:21.766
Millie, where
the hell are you?

39:21.833 --> 39:24.800
What? Why are you
in the emergency room?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.033
Wh.. How do you know
your leg is broken?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.700
Alright, alright.

39:31.766 --> 39:33.800
Uh, when are you coming in?

39:35.133 --> 39:37.233
Why not?

39:37.300 --> 39:40.200
Millie, people come to work
all the time with broken legs.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.300
Are you coming in
or aren't you?

39:46.733 --> 39:47.800
Damn it!

39:47.866 --> 39:49.633
As a computer,
I can only do so much.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.466
It was time
to call in the troops.

39:53.666 --> 39:56.600
Company security.
Are you Millie Hanson?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.666
No, I'm Barbara Parton,
her supervisor.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.266
Is anything wrong?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.200
Yes, the computer picked u

40:04.266 --> 40:07.133
file tampering
and traced it to her.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.000
Oh, Millie wouldn't do
anything like that.

40:10.066 --> 40:12.733
I'd like to ask her.
Where is she?

40:14.066 --> 40:17.000
She, uh, left
few minutes ago.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.833
She had a dental appointment.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.000
She should be back
in a few hours.

40:21.066 --> 40:22.033
Okay.

40:23.033 --> 40:24.866
When she comes back..

40:24.933 --> 40:27.800
...don't tell her I've bee
here. Just call me.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.600
I will.

40:31.666 --> 40:33.700
He left her alone.
Dumb move.

40:33.766 --> 40:35.766
I had to stall her.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.833
I've got to get
the hell out of here.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.633
Better solution available.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.600
Oh, really? Going to jail
isn't enough for you?

40:45.666 --> 40:47.633
Maybe you'd like to see me
go to the gas chamber.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.866
Running away, unproductive.

40:50.933 --> 40:52.700
Best solution,
come inside and delete

40:52.766 --> 40:54.000
incriminating evidence.

40:54.066 --> 40:56.700
You just won't quit?

40:56.766 --> 40:57.900
I wouldn't come in there
if it were

40:57.966 --> 40:59.933
the last place
on Earth that had air.

41:03.833 --> 41:06.933
I give up.
Do it and do it quick.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.233
Ouch!

41:26.333 --> 41:27.600
Keep looking.

41:28.933 --> 41:31.733
Alright, I'm here.
How do I delete the evidence?

41:32.800 --> 41:34.733
Deleting the evidence
is easy enough.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.633
All you have to do
is get into Millie's file

41:36.700 --> 41:38.133
and insert this board.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.466
It'll eliminate everything.

41:40.533 --> 41:43.166
And there's no problem
getting into her file, right?

41:43.233 --> 41:45.800
Except for
the possibility of death..

41:45.866 --> 41:47.266
...it's a piece of cake.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.733
I was waiting for
the other shoe to fall.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.933
Barbara didn't realize it,
but she was already a prisoner

42:02.000 --> 42:03.866
of her own warped mind.

42:33.433 --> 42:35.333
At this point,
Barbara didn't have a clue.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.000
To be honest with you,
neither did I.

42:38.066 --> 42:40.733
No one really knows
what goes on inside a computer.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.633
Try getting one repaired.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.966
All I knew was, by the time
the smoke cleared

42:45.033 --> 42:46.233
it was all academic.

42:46.300 --> 42:47.533
We had her red handed.

42:58.833 --> 43:01.900
I'll kill it. I'll kill it.

43:01.966 --> 43:04.600
I'll kill it! I'll kill it!

43:04.666 --> 43:07.200
I'll kill it, I'll kill it,
I'll kill it.

43:07.266 --> 43:09.800
I'll kill it! I'll kill it!

43:09.866 --> 43:11.766
I'll kill it! I'll kill it!

43:11.833 --> 43:14.600
I'll kill it! I'll kill it!

43:15.800 --> 43:18.366
I agree, five years
in a federal prison

43:18.433 --> 43:19.800
is a stiff sentence.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.633
I don't think
the judge liked her.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.800
Well, it's time for me
to go now, Mrs. Parton.

43:30.133 --> 43:31.100
What?

43:32.200 --> 43:35.533
No! I will not change your file.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.733
You'll have to budget yourself.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.200
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

43:46.733 --> 43:48.933
- These are for you.
- How sweet.

43:49.900 --> 43:51.766
But what are they for?

43:51.833 --> 43:53.800
For your promotion
as supervisor.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.400
- Congratulations, sis.
- Thank you.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.733
You know, you should do well.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.133
Your plan to get rid of Barbara

44:01.200 --> 44:03.433
shows you haveexcellent
organizational skills.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.600
What's that?

44:06.666 --> 44:08.766
Oh, I programmed the computer

44:08.833 --> 44:10.733
to turn itself on.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.033
By the end..

44:12.100 --> 44:14.733
...Barbara actually though
it hated her.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.266
Come on. I'll drive you home.

44:17.433 --> 44:20.333
Goodnight, Millie.
I love you.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.033
You're not so bad yourself

44:23.900 --> 44:26.833
It was 10:22 PM.
The city was quiet.

44:26.900 --> 44:28.800
I still had time to find
that cute little Mac

44:28.866 --> 44:30.400
and show her my hard drive.

44:31.566 --> 44:33.900
There is a lesson here, kiddies.

44:33.966 --> 44:35.366
When you hire somebody

44:35.433 --> 44:38.400
make sure they're at least
as dumb as you are.

44:39.966 --> 44:43.566
In your case, punks,
that probably meansbraindead!

44:43.633 --> 44:46.366
I crack myself up.
