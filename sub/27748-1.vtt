When I was 16,
I had lice in my hair.

00:59.406 --> 01:02.365
My mom shaved it all off.

01:02.539 --> 01:05.935
I looked like a peanut.
I hated it.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.763
That wasn't the worst thing
that happened that summer.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.507
When I was 16,
my father went to the moon.

02:01.816 --> 02:03.906
They used to come here
for the lake.

02:06.037 --> 02:08.127
That's where
the hotel used to be,

02:08.300 --> 02:11.000
and there's the boathouse.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.610
My dad said when he was little,
he'd go fishing in the lake,

02:13.784 --> 02:17.572
that you could water-ski
in it too.

02:17.746 --> 02:21.705

Dad!

03:14.542 --> 03:16.108
Jesus Christ,
Mickey.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.110
If he wants to be alone,
he can be alone.

03:18.284 --> 03:20.242
So goddamn
melodramatic.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.818
Speculation was that
Uncle John went off to hide somewhere,

03:30.992 --> 03:35.127
maybe Mexico, because he thought
he was in trouble about the fight.

03:35.301 --> 03:37.216
But he wasn't.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.179
We just never
saw him again.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.013
Thank you for this food

03:51.187 --> 03:54.189
and that we can
all be together.

- Amen.
- Amen.

04:03.503 --> 04:05.810
Quit it.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.033
Hey, stop
fucking around and eat.

04:37.798 --> 04:40.932
I suppose it doesn't matter
now why Uncle John left.

04:41.105 --> 04:44.240
All that matters, I guess,
is that he did leave.

04:49.637 --> 04:53.031
The next day, we heard the
factory would shut down for good.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.822
My father said
that we could start over,

05:00.995 --> 05:02.867
and we believed him.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.740
But my mother?

05:05.913 --> 05:08.959
She's been my father's girl
since she was 15.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.048
I don't want to
drag you out there.

05:11.223 --> 05:14.444
I have to see how it is!
Does that not make sense?

05:14.617 --> 05:17.838
- You're just gonna leave like everyone else?
- I'm not everyone else.

05:18.012 --> 05:20.884
She started over with him one too many
times to believe such a thing was possible.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.452
What aboutthem? Why do you
think I'm doing this?

05:25.846 --> 05:28.240
What am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and rot?

05:28.415 --> 05:30.764
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to think about us!

05:30.939 --> 05:33.071
There is nothing here!

05:54.091 --> 05:56.355
It's okay.
I'll stay, okay?

06:37.701 --> 06:39.355
Yeah!

06:40.965 --> 06:42.663
It's still got
a lot of power, okay?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.274
- Do not gas it.
- Okay.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.754
You got to start off slow.
Right? You tell him.

06:47.928 --> 06:50.235
- Don't go fast.
- Start off slow.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.324
- You don't have to go fast the first time.
- Okay.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.370
- Start it. Tell him to start it.
- Start it, start it.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.591
Just don't crash.

06:57.764 --> 07:00.767
There we go.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.300
How's he doing?

07:17.697 --> 07:20.918
I'm going for the ribs.
Are you ready?

07:48.641 --> 07:51.471
I'm just gonna use
the bathroom, okay?

07:57.215 --> 07:58.913
I'll be right back.

08:12.795 --> 08:14.798
Are we home yet?

08:14.971 --> 08:16.757
No, not yet.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.627
Want some cookies?

08:18.802 --> 08:20.151
Where's Dad?

08:20.324 --> 08:21.978
He'll be back soon.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.331
I'm this one.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.074
No!

08:33.903 --> 08:35.818
Oh! No, no.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.826
- Yes! I win!
- Such a cheater.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.176
- How am I cheating?
- You just knocked me off.

08:45.350 --> 08:48.178
That's the whole point
of the game.

08:50.485 --> 08:52.532
What's taking him so long?

09:27.217 --> 09:28.828
Hey, Dad?

09:33.268 --> 09:34.878
Dad!

10:24.318 --> 10:26.147
Hey.

10:26.321 --> 10:29.366
You can't park here.
Let's go.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.183
Sonya Stecko
said her dad wrote her

11:03.357 --> 11:05.447
a rambling 16-page letter.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.451
He said he loved her,
and offered her advice

11:09.625 --> 11:12.366
about marriage, money,
and other subjects.

11:16.283 --> 11:19.287
It was as if he'd planned to miss
the next 30 years of her life.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.441
My neighbor Summer's dad left
in the middle of the night.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.488
She found her dad's car
in a ditch.

11:46.662 --> 11:49.056
There was no blood
in the car.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.361
It was as if he vaporized
out of the driver's seat

11:51.536 --> 11:54.148
and just floated away.

11:57.890 --> 12:00.937
Val's father owned the bar
on Avenue A.

12:01.110 --> 12:03.548
One day he left
the store unattended.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.202
He'd taken all the cash
and left a note.

12:08.857 --> 12:10.817
After that,
when a dad left,

12:10.990 --> 12:14.124
we'd just say,
"He went to the moon."

12:14.298 --> 12:17.388
"We're going to the moon,"
we imagined them saying.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.643

We told them they fish
for supper there.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.256
They wear deer skins
and make fires for heat.

23:10.126 --> 23:13.086
At sunset they sing
all the old songs.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.567
The ones grandpa
used to sing us.

23:17.482 --> 23:21.529
Kolya laughed so hard,
he nearly wet himself.

23:21.703 --> 23:24.881
He wanted life here to be
as good as the moon.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.683
So, what do you want?

23:44.857 --> 23:47.512
Just a little
off the sides.

23:47.686 --> 23:49.427
I have a job interview
tomorrow.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.559
You're definitely
the longest hair I've had

23:51.733 --> 23:53.387
on a boy today.

23:53.561 --> 23:55.390
I don't really like
getting my hair cut.

23:55.564 --> 23:58.219
I get it, I get it. We'll make
it as painless as possible.

24:14.147 --> 24:16.192
Yo, guys.

24:16.366 --> 24:18.847
You know I once saw
a flying "saucerus"?

24:20.849 --> 24:23.417
I was up in Joshua Tree
camping with my dad.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
We couldn't find our car,

24:25.681 --> 24:28.423
so we tried to find our way
by the stars.

24:28.596 --> 24:31.295
Then suddenly
there was this noise

24:31.470 --> 24:33.427
and colored lights.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.647
I've never seen
anything like it.

24:37.387 --> 24:39.346
I'm serious. No lie.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.829
Do you guys solemnly swear
that we will not go to the moon?

24:44.003 --> 24:46.006
- Dude.
- Fuck, yeah, I'm in.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.702
We're both in.

24:49.965 --> 24:52.229
Hey, Mickey.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.840
Do you swear that
you won't go to the moon?

24:58.974 --> 25:00.846
Fuck, yeah. That's right.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.893
No moon.

25:16.078 --> 25:18.125
Cookie!

25:18.298 --> 25:19.692
- Cookie!
- Cookie!

25:19.865 --> 25:21.345
- Cookie!
- Cookie!

25:21.519 --> 25:22.955
Hey, Cook!

25:23.130 --> 25:25.174
What do you guys need?

25:27.263 --> 25:29.701
We got some scrap.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.790
What do you guys want
for it?

25:31.964 --> 25:33.705
That trailer.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.837
Yeah, right.
You lost your mind?

25:36.011 --> 25:37.536
How about those bikes?

25:37.710 --> 25:40.625
What do you think, Belle?

25:40.799 --> 25:42.278
Belle?

25:42.452 --> 25:44.064
Hey, what do you think?

25:44.238 --> 25:46.369
You think we should,
uh, do that?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.981
- Come on, Belle.
- I got a treat. Come on, Belle.

25:49.155 --> 25:51.810
- Come on, Belle. Here, puppy.
- Come on, Belle.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.421
Come on, Belle.
I'll give you a treat.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.728
- Belle...
- Want a treat?

25:55.902 --> 25:58.077
She's not too friendly right now.
How about one more load?

25:58.251 --> 26:00.950
- I love you, Belle.
- Deal.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.863
Mother ship, mother ship,
we're about to launch!

27:15.938 --> 27:18.941
With all the
men gone, we boys became men.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.729
Heh. Nice.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.470
Good.
See you soon.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.994
Hey.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.867
Did you get the job?

27:33.041 --> 27:34.826
Yes.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.133
Great.

27:38.743 --> 27:41.660
So, shorter, huh?

27:41.834 --> 27:45.358
Did you get a job at a
grocery store or the army?

27:45.532 --> 27:47.622
Yeah.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.145
It's weird.
So how's your day going?

27:50.319 --> 27:53.105
Uh, good. Busy.

27:53.279 --> 27:55.804
You?

27:55.978 --> 27:58.676
Just trying to figure out
that cash register.

28:00.242 --> 28:03.333
You better figure it out.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.686
Looks nice pulled off
your face like that.

28:10.165 --> 28:11.690
Thanks.

28:15.605 --> 28:17.346
Am I your last customer?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.348
Mm-hmm.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.961
You want to, uh,
maybe, uh,

28:23.135 --> 28:25.224
have a drink with me
or something, or...

28:25.398 --> 28:29.055
get a bite to eat,
talk?

28:29.229 --> 28:32.188
God!

28:32.362 --> 28:34.712
Um...

28:34.886 --> 28:36.845
my kids are
coming home soon.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.500
I should probably
make dinner for them.

28:39.673 --> 28:42.721
- Yeah.
- But thanks.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.986
You're welcome.

29:12.228 --> 29:15.317
- You did good, though.
- Oh, thank you.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.147
Moo, moo, moo!

29:19.321 --> 29:22.238
Hey, why can't I get a kiss?
Come on.

29:22.412 --> 29:23.805
Dicks.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.851
Fuck.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.548
See Val's
cousin over there?

29:28.722 --> 29:31.987
- She's kind of a babe.
- Yeah, she's such a babe.

29:35.903 --> 29:38.340
Let's go have
a baby with her.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.734
Gross!

29:40.909 --> 29:43.999
- Maybe she'll come over here.
- Fuck, yeah.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.753
Some of these small fragments will
enter Earth's atmosphere tonight,

29:59.927 --> 30:03.061
but they will undoubtedly
explode into nothing more

30:03.236 --> 30:06.107
than a harmless shower
of tiny meteorites,

30:06.281 --> 30:08.109
according to NASA.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.721
The greatest concentration
of this meteor shower

30:10.895 --> 30:13.768
will be in the southwest
region of the United States.

30:13.942 --> 30:17.728
This meteor shower will be,
however, quite harmless...

30:18.903 --> 30:20.775
Do you have a girlfriend?

30:25.126 --> 30:27.564
You don't have anyone?

30:27.738 --> 30:30.175
Not really.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.222
What about you?

30:34.396 --> 30:36.095
Do you have
a boyfriend?

30:45.799 --> 30:48.106
You want to do it?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.717
What?

30:54.026 --> 30:55.983
Have you ever...

30:56.157 --> 30:57.768
you know.

31:03.164 --> 31:04.818
You tell me.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.981
Hey.

31:50.559 --> 31:52.998
- You have an eyelash.
- Oh.

31:57.523 --> 31:59.307
You want to
make a wish?

33:52.900 --> 33:55.771
It says that you're
selfish when it comes to love.

33:55.945 --> 33:59.124
And your end line says
that you're creative.

34:00.559 --> 34:02.257
And...

34:04.738 --> 34:07.871
And your lifeline
says that you're...

34:08.045 --> 34:09.786
gonna die young.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.137
I'm just kidding!
I'm just fucking with you!

34:12.311 --> 34:15.009
It says here that you're gonna
be a cat lady when you grow up.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.230
Look at that.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.873
You're back.

35:38.047 --> 35:40.311
Do you know where
our daddies are?

36:25.835 --> 36:27.402
Get out.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.317
- I know I fucked up.
- Get the fuck out!

36:29.490 --> 36:31.623
- I fucked up really bad.
- You left me!

36:31.797 --> 36:34.670
You don't get to just walk back in here!
Get out!

36:34.844 --> 36:37.717
Get out! Go!
Get out now!

36:58.998 --> 37:00.827
Hey, Mickey, it's Mom.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.264
Just calling to check in
on you and Kolya.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.744
Grandma says hi.

37:05.918 --> 37:08.137
I'll be back tomorrow.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.750
Call me and let me know
you guys are okay?

37:53.706 --> 37:55.621
What are you doing?

37:55.795 --> 37:58.449
Help me out
and open this door.

37:58.623 --> 38:01.757
Dad's coming back, and he'll
be sad his chair is gone.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.847
- Dad's not ever coming back, kiddo. Sorry.
- Dad's coming home!

38:05.021 --> 38:08.329
Don't fucking touch the chair, okay?
He's not fucking coming back.

38:08.503 --> 38:11.766
He's never coming back.
Ever.

38:31.873 --> 38:33.659
Open the door.

38:36.965 --> 38:38.880
Let me in, okay?

38:42.581 --> 38:43.885
Fuck.

38:51.545 --> 38:53.505
He is going to the moon.

38:54.940 --> 38:57.030
We're going to the moon.

38:58.771 --> 39:00.902
I'm going to the moon.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.684
Kolya?

39:58.699 --> 40:00.398
Kolya!

40:17.239 --> 40:19.286
We're gonna
find him, okay?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.244
I don't care if we have to
search the whole desert.

40:21.418 --> 40:23.333
We're gonna find him.

41:17.648 --> 41:19.563
Now, here's
what we'll do.

41:21.260 --> 41:22.958
I'm gonna
count to three,

41:23.132 --> 41:25.525
and then I'm gonna let go,

41:25.699 --> 41:27.702
and then we're gonna
go back inside.

41:29.137 --> 41:30.530
Okay?

41:32.967 --> 41:35.623
- Is that okay with you?
- Okay.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.668
Can I count?

41:39.192 --> 41:41.106
Okay.

41:43.021 --> 41:44.893
One...

41:45.067 --> 41:46.634
two...

41:46.807 --> 41:48.766
three.

42:35.856 --> 42:38.512
I'm such
a piece of shit.

42:38.686 --> 42:41.427
I'm so fucking sorry
I left you.

42:43.342 --> 42:46.346
I miss that damn Madonna of
yours, and that Hula Hoop.

42:52.873 --> 42:54.659
But you're brave,

42:54.833 --> 42:56.485
and you're strong.

42:57.965 --> 43:00.360
You've got this
crazy fucking dream.

43:00.534 --> 43:02.405
You're following it.

43:02.579 --> 43:04.451
You're gonna make it.

43:06.018 --> 43:07.496
You don't need me.

43:07.672 --> 43:09.847
You're fine on your own.

43:16.331 --> 43:17.985
It's just...

43:19.465 --> 43:20.945
Goddamn it.

43:22.556 --> 43:24.210
It's just..

43:28.867 --> 43:31.391
I guess
I really need...

43:41.793 --> 43:43.969
You know,
I miss you, Dad.

44:43.244 --> 44:44.681
What's wrong?

44:50.121 --> 44:52.864
It's just, my dad.

44:53.038 --> 44:56.344
You know,
he's not in good shape.

44:56.518 --> 44:58.304
I've been thinking
about it,

44:58.478 --> 45:01.132
and, um...

45:01.306 --> 45:04.353
There's this farm

45:04.527 --> 45:06.920
out in Nebraska
where he found work.

45:08.574 --> 45:11.534
And he says that
there is a good school.

45:13.972 --> 45:16.103
We could take care
of each other there, you know?

45:17.976 --> 45:20.543
You're...

45:20.717 --> 45:22.588
You're going
with him?

45:25.679 --> 45:28.507
If it sucks out there,
I'll come back.

45:28.681 --> 45:31.336
I just...
I feel like...

45:40.867 --> 45:43.175
I'm not leaving
until Thursday.

45:45.612 --> 45:48.092
I think that you and I
will both be happier

45:48.266 --> 45:49.833
if we both...

45:51.356 --> 45:53.445
Mickey.

45:56.101 --> 45:57.885
Mickey!

46:54.333 --> 46:56.117
Bye, Sonya.

46:56.291 --> 46:58.336
- Be careful.
- I will. Thank you.

46:58.510 --> 47:00.730
Bye, Doc.

47:02.731 --> 47:05.952
- Be careful.
- All right, thanks.

47:06.126 --> 47:07.911
Oh!

47:08.085 --> 47:10.784
What is that face?

47:10.958 --> 47:13.525
I'm gonna miss you
the most.

47:13.699 --> 47:15.744
Be strong, okay?

47:17.746 --> 47:19.574
Hey, Sonya!

47:19.748 --> 47:22.056
Hey, Summer.

47:22.230 --> 47:23.579
Oh, man.

47:23.753 --> 47:25.407
- Sonya.
- Hey.

47:25.581 --> 47:27.496
- Oh, I'm glad I made it.
- Me too.

47:27.670 --> 47:29.847
I almost thought I wasn't
gonna get to say bye to anyone.

47:30.021 --> 47:31.936
I'm so happy for you,
like...

47:32.110 --> 47:33.981
There's so much out there,
you know?

47:34.155 --> 47:36.027
You don't even know.
There's just nothing here,

47:36.201 --> 47:38.463
so I hope
you enjoy it out there.

47:40.335 --> 47:42.467
Don't cry.
You're gonna make me cry.

47:42.641 --> 47:44.208
I am not gonna cry.

47:50.215 --> 47:52.043
Live it long!

48:00.050 --> 48:02.226
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

48:14.369 --> 48:18.634
♪ Paradise ♪

48:18.807 --> 48:23.726
♪ Is there something more ♪

49:24.047 --> 49:26.005
Stop the car!

51:02.146 --> 51:04.452
Hey, man, you good?

51:49.583 --> 51:51.195
- Hey, Mickey.
- Hey.

51:51.369 --> 51:53.110
What do you need?

51:53.284 --> 51:55.894
Can I get a whiskey,
neat, please.

52:12.737 --> 52:14.434
Last call.

52:14.608 --> 52:16.610
You want another?

52:48.903 --> 52:51.210
What happened to your hand?

52:51.385 --> 52:53.648
Nothing.

52:53.822 --> 52:55.780
Really?

52:57.434 --> 52:59.393
I never thought of you
as the fighting type.

54:33.007 --> 54:35.141
Don't tell me
you need another haircut.

54:35.315 --> 54:37.012
No.

54:37.186 --> 54:39.014
I just wanted to give you
a thank-you present.

54:39.188 --> 54:40.929
You got me that job.

54:47.108 --> 54:48.719
Want a cup of coffee?

54:48.893 --> 54:50.373
I'd love one.

54:54.507 --> 54:57.032
Where'd you get
the cookies?

54:57.206 --> 54:59.947
- Baked them.
- No way.

55:00.121 --> 55:02.690
I got 'em from my work.

55:04.648 --> 55:07.172
- So I guess it's going good, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

55:08.782 --> 55:10.481
Yeah, real good.

55:29.195 --> 55:30.456
No.

55:30.630 --> 55:32.981
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

55:33.155 --> 55:34.679
I'll go.

55:46.952 --> 55:48.213
Okay.

55:49.650 --> 55:51.434
Uh, sorry.

57:01.766 --> 57:04.550
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Huh?

57:04.724 --> 57:07.248
- Stay away from my fucking mother!
- What are you doing!

57:07.423 --> 57:09.077
- Fucking motherfucker!
- What the fuck are you doing?

57:09.251 --> 57:10.992
- What are you doing?
- Fuck you!

57:11.166 --> 57:13.733
What is this?
Come on.

57:13.907 --> 57:15.387
Nick, stop!

57:15.561 --> 57:17.563
Nick, that's enough!

57:17.737 --> 57:19.173
I'll fucking kill you!

57:19.347 --> 57:21.481
- Nick! Nick, stop, man!
- Fucking bitch!

57:21.655 --> 57:23.570
I'll fucking kill you!

57:23.744 --> 57:26.137
Nick, stop!

57:26.311 --> 57:28.269
Nick!

57:30.708 --> 57:32.449
Nick!

57:38.889 --> 57:40.891
Nick!

57:41.065 --> 57:42.762
Slow down, man.

57:44.590 --> 57:47.072
- Nick, calm the fuck down.
- Get off me.

57:47.246 --> 57:49.639
- Fuckin', dude.
- Get off!

57:49.813 --> 57:52.206
- Nick.
- Get the fuck off me!

57:54.034 --> 57:55.559
Fuck!

57:55.733 --> 57:57.474
I'm not him.

58:37.949 --> 58:39.516
Mickey....

58:41.865 --> 58:43.867
Mickey...

58:44.041 --> 58:46.434
Mickey, please?

58:49.916 --> 58:52.528
You hungry?
Can I get you some food?

58:55.009 --> 58:56.793
I'm all right.

59:01.581 --> 59:03.277
Listen, Mickey...

59:05.846 --> 59:08.545
There's no one else.

59:08.719 --> 59:10.197
Look at me.

59:11.764 --> 59:14.246
It's just us, okay?

59:52.371 --> 59:54.503
The older boy,

59:54.677 --> 59:57.594
he soon left
for the moon.

59:57.768 --> 01:00:00.030
We just
never saw him again.

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:09.344
Even though
the lake is almost gone,

01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:11.563
birds still come
in the winter--

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.481
ducks, geese and cranes.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.918
They come back every year.

01:00:20.398 --> 01:00:23.445
I think about our dad,

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:26.099
and how he'll be back
by then too.

01:01:05.965 --> 01:01:09.230
Oh, hey.
It's your cousin, Val.

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:16.019
Yo, Val. Did you know
Mickey spread them legs?

01:01:16.193 --> 01:01:18.456
No, I'm serious.

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.893
He was all up in that.
She was like...

01:01:23.548 --> 01:01:26.246
Then she was like,
"Oh, yes! Mickey!"

01:01:33.079 --> 01:01:35.735
We're having a swordfight.

01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:39.347
Not a very good one, but...

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.268
What's wrong?

01:01:50.967 --> 01:01:52.621
I'm pregnant.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.367
That night when
we were together...

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:02.414
I don't know.

01:02:02.588 --> 01:02:05.503
It's so stupid, I know.

01:02:05.677 --> 01:02:08.463
I... I don't expect
anything from you.

01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:10.856
I just found out.

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:12.858
I just thought
I should let you know now.

01:02:13.032 --> 01:02:14.425
Mickey!

01:02:14.599 --> 01:02:16.514
Come back
to the dark side!

01:02:16.688 --> 01:02:18.516
We're winning!

01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:21.085
No, wait,
we're losing!

01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:23.000
Mickey...

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.177
I'll talk
to you later, okay?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.224
I'm your father.
Mickey!

01:02:30.398 --> 01:02:32.226
Come back!

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.577
Come back!

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.666
Get her, Mickey!

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.972
Hey, Kolya.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:52.976
Hey, get up.

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.244
Hey, I...

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:03.202
want to give you
something.

01:05:03.376 --> 01:05:04.943
What?

01:05:05.117 --> 01:05:06.684
My BMX.

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:09.469
Why?

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:13.083
I'm going away for a while.

01:05:15.519 --> 01:05:17.565
I'm gonna go find Sonya.

01:05:19.175 --> 01:05:21.307
You're leaving?

01:05:21.481 --> 01:05:23.831
I'm gonna be back.
I just...

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.922
I have to find her.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.536
Kolya....

01:05:33.407 --> 01:05:35.670
Please don't cry, Kolya.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:41.110
Kolya, I'm sorry.

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:44.722
Kolya,
please don't cry.

01:06:42.259 --> 01:06:44.521
[Mickey narrating I wonder
if my father's happy.

01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:49.266
I imagine him in a castle,

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.355
with pools and huge tables
of food and beer.

01:06:55.097 --> 01:06:57.577
I imagine him lounging nude
in hot tubs

01:06:57.751 --> 01:06:59.797
with women half his age,

01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:02.931
women who were on the moon
when our fathers got there.

01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:09.068
I imagine the weather
on the moon to be nice,

01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:11.896
and that our fathers
are singing songs in praise

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.333
of their new lives.

01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:20.210
I sense that there's music
on the moon.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.128

- Dude, that was a bank shot.
- I didn't miss anything.

01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:40.072
This is a bank shot.
See how it hits the rail?

01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:42.421
You didn't call
that bank, man.

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.162
Dude, that is not how
we play around here, man.

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:48.078
- What do you mean?
- Dude, that is not how we play.

01:08:48.252 --> 01:08:50.037
- We call our shots...
- You need an attitude adjustment, pal?

01:08:50.212 --> 01:08:52.301
Didn't hit rail one.
Nothing but net.

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:54.608
That's a good shot.

01:08:54.782 --> 01:08:57.131
- Not in my book, it's not a good shot.
- Bank shot, nothing.

01:08:57.305 --> 01:08:59.220
Are you broke? You don't want to pay?
Is that your fucking problem?

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:02.136
- That's not we play here.
- Why don't you deal with it?

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:04.921

me to whip the shit out of you?

- Hey. Uncle Johnny.

01:09:13.756 --> 01:09:15.716
Mickey?

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:17.283
What the hell, dude?

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:19.764
Oh, my God!
how have you been?

01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:21.939
What are you...
What are you doing here?

01:09:22.113 --> 01:09:24.680
Bring anyone else
with you?

01:09:24.854 --> 01:09:26.725
Just me.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.426
Come on,
let's have a drink.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.429
Come on.
Pinky, set us up one.

01:09:32.603 --> 01:09:35.475
♪ And there
I'd be willing to die ♪

01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:55.930
So how's Nick?

01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:59.020
The boy--
how's he been?

01:09:59.978 --> 01:10:01.761
He's been great.

01:10:01.935 --> 01:10:04.417
Yeah, I knew he would be.

01:10:04.591 --> 01:10:06.592
He was a tough one.

01:10:08.073 --> 01:10:10.902
I guess your dad
left too, huh?

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:16.037
You understand that,
as a dad,

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.649
there's a hell of a lot
on our plate, you know.

01:10:18.823 --> 01:10:20.824
And I understand
a little bit of animosity,

01:10:20.998 --> 01:10:23.261
and shit, hell,
I get it, I really do.

01:10:23.435 --> 01:10:26.525
But, uh, everybody kind of
leaves for different reasons.

01:10:26.699 --> 01:10:28.658
Do you have any idea
where he is?

01:10:28.832 --> 01:10:31.530
If you're looking for a dad,
you found a hell of a dad.

01:10:33.837 --> 01:10:35.666
Oh, shit.
You're probably better off

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.277
without us anyway, man.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:41.932
If we could turn back,

01:10:42.106 --> 01:10:43.935
I know we would.

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:46.154
I sure the hell would.

01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:50.462
Onward and upward,
you know.

01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:54.118
When are you coming back?

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.345
Probably just
another few months.

01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:11.440
At least I got to,
you know, make sure

01:11:11.614 --> 01:11:15.052
the truck's running good enough
to get there solid and safe.

01:11:15.226 --> 01:11:17.403
I don't know
what the fuck to give him.

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:31.503
I always knew he was strong.

01:11:31.677 --> 01:11:33.724
I'm glad to hear
he's doing good.

01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:37.336
It's about time he started
looking forward to

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.381
getting into
something better anyway.

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:02.012
Just keep
spending time with him.

01:12:02.186 --> 01:12:04.057
He needs something.

01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:06.234
You know what I mean?

01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:46.689
Is there
some happiness in the desert?

01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:49.474
Of course there is.

01:16:49.648 --> 01:16:52.694
Still, that doesn't
change everything.

01:16:52.868 --> 01:16:54.871
It doesn't change this.

01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:05.097
