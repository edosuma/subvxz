<i>In Jane's case,</i>

You better fix this,

Heh. Fabian is perfect

01:42.811 --> 01:45.814
fling material.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.193
I'm definitely not

01:48.483 --> 01:50.193
into dating him,

01:50.193 --> 01:53.196
but, oh, he is the hottest guy

01:50.193 --> 01:53.196
I have ever seen.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.075
Yeah, it's kind of hard

01:59.327 --> 02:00.662
I saw it on Dad's script

02:00.662 --> 02:02.873
and made a mental note

02:00.662 --> 02:02.873
in my sex brain.

Wow, you are really ready

tonight.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.552
But tonight is

03:32.420 --> 03:34.840
I loved him.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.840
You know that.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.467
So you better fix this,

03:34.840 --> 03:37.467
or I will tell everyone

03:37.467 --> 03:38.886
that you were in his

03:37.467 --> 03:38.886
apartment that night,

03:38.886 --> 03:40.762
and you stole his burn book.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.682
I was only in his apartment

03:40.762 --> 03:43.682
to get your clothes,

03:43.682 --> 03:44.850
because you asked me to!

03:44.850 --> 03:46.560
I didn't know he was dead.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.437
Maybe you did this.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.939
Maybe you killed him.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.482
You always hated him.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.901
That's ridiculous.

Stop it.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.069
Did you do it?

03:55.069 --> 03:57.529
Of course not.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.529
I-I loved him.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.239
Then why did you

03:57.529 --> 03:59.239
threaten him?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.076
The police say

04:00.323 --> 04:02.076
they have a video.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.953
Apparently a guest

04:02.076 --> 04:04.953

Never come near me again!

No!

No, I couldn't have...

04:21.511 --> 04:24.139
I don't think.

Okay, we have

Yes, yes, he was flirting

04:30.187 --> 04:34.149
with a waitress.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.860
I got very jealous.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.860
Scott was mad.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.112
He hated when

04:36.860 --> 04:38.112
I would get jealous,

04:38.112 --> 04:39.362
but I can't help it.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.864
In the orphanage,

04:39.362 --> 04:40.864
you always have to

04:40.864 --> 04:42.407
look out for your bread

04:40.864 --> 04:42.407
and your boyfriend.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.700
That night, Anezka...

04:43.700 --> 04:48.747
Yes, I...

04:43.700 --> 04:48.747
I got a text.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.791
He was breaking up with me.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.334
<i>I texted him back...</i>

04:55.587 --> 04:56.922
<i>...but he said no.</i>

PETRA:

05:02.427 --> 05:03.553
<i>Oh, no,</i>

05:03.553 --> 05:06.389

05:03.553 --> 05:06.389
( crying )

05:06.389 --> 05:08.267
Let me help you.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.393
I could get you out

05:08.267 --> 05:10.393
on the first flight tomorrow.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.020
I'll pack up your things.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.647
That way you don't have

05:12.020 --> 05:13.647
to see Scott again.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.647
No...

05:13.647 --> 05:16.483
No, no, really, it's...

05:13.647 --> 05:16.483
it's not a problem.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.777
You should just go.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.661
And that's all I remember.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.204
I fall asleep on couch.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.330
Well, you're on a video,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.706
so you must have

05:30.330 --> 05:31.706
gone back out

05:31.706 --> 05:33.541
after I went back to work.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.128
I was so drunk,

05:33.541 --> 05:36.128
I can't remember.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.214
But no, I couldn't

05:36.128 --> 05:39.214
have killed him.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.715
No, I loved him.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.301
Oh, you know how

05:40.715 --> 05:42.301

Please, beautiful sister,

<i>I want to fix it, of course,</i>

05:47.973 --> 05:51.143
but I just can't believe

05:47.973 --> 05:51.143
Lina came back to Miami

05:51.143 --> 05:52.811
and didn't call me.

Yeah, Oprah and Gayle

something like this.

they spend some

06:15.083 --> 06:17.085
Thanks, Dad, but I think

I'll just talk to her.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.062
Later, I slipped

12:49.352 --> 12:51.062
a little something

12:51.062 --> 12:52.689
in Anezka's drink

12:51.062 --> 12:52.689
just to help her sleep.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.359
clear to Scott

12:56.359 --> 12:58.152
that Anezka didn't want

12:56.359 --> 12:58.152
to be with him anymore.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.987
ANEZKA:

12:58.152 --> 12:59.987
No! I hate you!

12:59.987 --> 13:03.241
I wish you were dead!

12:59.987 --> 13:03.241
Never come near me again!

13:03.241 --> 13:05.452
My plan would've

13:03.241 --> 13:05.452
worked perfectly.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.621
Except then Scott had to go die

13:05.452 --> 13:07.621
and ruin everything.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.290
May he rest in peace.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.833
So you've been lying

13:10.290 --> 13:12.833
to the police this whole time?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.754
I mean...high-level, yes,

13:15.754 --> 13:19.215
but it only became relevant

13:15.754 --> 13:19.215

13:20.300 --> 13:22.260
the truth from you

She couldn't have killed him,

Um...I completely agree.

You agree that I'm going

14:40.588 --> 14:42.965

Maybe.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.957
And I pushed back our dinner

15:16.957 --> 15:18.418
so we can make love first.

we actually just...

15:21.880 --> 15:23.506
talk?

15:23.506 --> 15:26.926
And I love you

15:23.506 --> 15:26.926

15:26.926 --> 15:30.722
but I just don't want

15:32.014 --> 15:33.600
I don't either, trust me.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
And we've always

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
moved so fast.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.062
I mean, we said,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.062
"I love you" on Beach Day

15:38.062 --> 15:40.022
in high school

15:38.062 --> 15:40.022
after dating for a week.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.359
And it was true,

15:40.022 --> 15:43.359
I did love you.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.779
And I love you now.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.321
And I've spent

15:47.321 --> 15:48.907
the last three years

15:47.321 --> 15:48.907
adjusting

15:48.907 --> 15:51.284
to life without you.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.869
And it wasn't as good.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.621
So we can slow down

15:54.621 --> 15:56.038
if that's what you want.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.874
But for my part,

15:57.874 --> 16:00.251
we're not moving fast enough.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.714
( in Spanish )

16:02.796 --> 16:04.714
You're moving in with Rogelio?

16:04.714 --> 16:07.133
you did that,

16:07.133 --> 16:09.051
it ended very badly.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.012
There's something to be said

16:09.051 --> 16:12.012
for doing things differently.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.515
( whispers )

16:12.012 --> 16:14.515
I have to go. We'll talk later.

Yes, right by the

Thank you very much.

Wait, Jane.

at this wedding venue

19:46.310 --> 19:47.937
that was supposedly booked,

19:47.937 --> 19:50.106

19:50.106 --> 19:52.692
You're leaving?

19:50.106 --> 19:52.692
I don't want to.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.402
I'd beg them to move it,

but there's just no other time,

19:55.402 --> 19:57.404

19:57.404 --> 19:59.157
at 8:00, and I leave

And as someone

29:14.712 --> 29:16.589
and I had our first fight,

31:56.832 --> 31:58.834
No, we're just

31:56.832 --> 31:58.834
really different.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.377
He doesn't read.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.796
Neither do I.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.796
( laughs )

32:02.796 --> 32:04.923
I mean, I'm just saying,

32:04.923 --> 32:08.260
on paper, you and I

32:04.923 --> 32:08.260
don't have much in common.

32:08.260 --> 32:12.556
So don't write him off just

32:08.260 --> 32:12.556
because you two are different.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.350
People surprise you.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.350
( laughs )

32:15.350 --> 32:17.977
And I like happy for you.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.021
I'm just--

32:17.977 --> 32:20.021
That's all I'm saying.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.901
I like it for you, too.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.572
Okay, why

32:26.278 --> 32:28.572
do we always end up

32:28.572 --> 32:29.907
on the bathroom floor?

32:29.907 --> 32:31.825
Oh, I don't know.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.825
I don't...

32:31.825 --> 32:35.662
But I'm glad that

32:31.825 --> 32:35.662
we always do.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.626
( in Spanish )

32:37.497 --> 32:40.626
You always feel

32:37.497 --> 32:40.626
better when you talk.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.379
And I'm pretty sure

32:42.502 --> 32:44.379
something's wrong--

32:44.379 --> 32:46.632
otherwise, you wouldn't be up.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.385
( in English )

32:48.091 --> 32:50.385
I don't want to say it to you.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.178
( in English )

32:50.385 --> 32:52.178
Okay.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.973
( in Spanish )

32:53.263 --> 32:54.973
But...

32:54.973 --> 32:59.269
Will you tell Mommy

32:54.973 --> 32:59.269
or Daddy at least?

33:00.646 --> 33:02.689
Good.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.734
Talking is good.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.986
It's hard sometimes.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.363
This is America.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.949
You should learn how

33:10.363 --> 33:11.949
to speak English.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.993
I know it is.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.664
But you always feel better

33:14.993 --> 33:18.664
when you're brave.

33:20.958 --> 33:26.045
So let's both try...

33:26.045 --> 33:28.465
to do better.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.968
Yes?

33:30.968 --> 33:32.218
And I just realized,

33:32.218 --> 33:34.095
how could I talk

33:32.218 --> 33:34.095
to my great-grandson

33:34.095 --> 33:36.097
about being brave,

33:34.095 --> 33:36.097
when I wasn't.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.267
So I'm marching this weekend.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.186
( in Spanish )

33:39.267 --> 33:41.186
That's fantastic for you, Alba.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.813
For "us".

33:42.813 --> 33:45.148
I made a sign

33:42.813 --> 33:45.148
for you too.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.775
Will you come with me?

33:46.775 --> 33:50.445
I'm not really

33:46.775 --> 33:50.445
a political person.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.323
Well, I'm not really either.

33:53.323 --> 33:57.536
But with everything

33:53.323 --> 33:57.536
going on in the world,

33:57.536 --> 33:59.621
maybe we should be.

33:59.621 --> 34:00.747
I just think--

34:00.747 --> 34:03.208
I'm not going to the march.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.084
End of story.

34:06.837 --> 34:09.589
So, Daddy called because he said

34:06.837 --> 34:09.589
you're upset about something.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.674
Yeah.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.551
Why do some people

34:10.674 --> 34:12.551
not want Bisa

34:12.551 --> 34:13.969
in this country?

34:19.307 --> 34:22.352
Well, that's actually

34:19.307 --> 34:22.352
a really good question,

34:22.352 --> 34:24.563
and a really hard question,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.398
because this country

34:24.563 --> 34:26.398
was founded by people

34:26.398 --> 34:29.735
who came from all over,

34:26.398 --> 34:29.735
like your great-grandma,

34:29.735 --> 34:33.530
because they dreamed of a better

34:29.735 --> 34:33.530
life with more opportunity.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.867
( in Spanish )

34:33.530 --> 34:36.867
You're undocumented, aren't you?

34:40.579 --> 34:43.999
I tried to get

34:40.579 --> 34:43.999
my green card years ago,

34:43.999 --> 34:46.877
but got scammed

34:43.999 --> 34:46.877
by a lawyer.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.295
All my savings.

34:49.295 --> 34:53.341
So I've been using

34:49.295 --> 34:53.341
my cousin's social security.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.510
I'm sorry

34:53.341 --> 34:55.510
I didn't tell you earlier,

34:55.510 --> 34:57.262
but you're so close

34:55.510 --> 34:57.262
with Rafael,

34:57.262 --> 35:01.558
and since he's my boss--

34:57.262 --> 35:01.558
You don't have to explain.

35:01.558 --> 35:05.645
But some people, well,

35:01.558 --> 35:05.645
they can't see that,

35:05.645 --> 35:07.773
and that's just

35:05.645 --> 35:07.773
a stinky, old fact.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.608
That is stinky.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.361
I got my green card

35:09.608 --> 35:13.361
three years ago.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.238
I know how complicated it is.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.199
( sighs )

35:15.238 --> 35:18.199
Especially now.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.328
I'll march for both of us.

35:24.081 --> 35:26.499
But no one is taking Bisa away,

35:26.499 --> 35:29.753
so you don't have to worry

35:26.499 --> 35:29.753
about that at all, okay?

35:29.753 --> 35:31.004
( yawns )

35:31.004 --> 35:32.631
Okay.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.050
Come on, Mr. Sweetface,

35:32.631 --> 35:35.050
let's go change you before bed.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.970

35:36.301 --> 35:37.970

35:56.655 --> 35:58.281

You don't have to be so huffy.

and instead of grooming

36:04.245 --> 36:07.082
and maintaining,

36:04.245 --> 36:07.082
I had to drive you here.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.167
Calm down.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.167
What is your problem?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.669
My problem is you, Alba!

36:10.669 --> 36:12.129
You and your judgy judgments.

36:12.129 --> 36:16.257
I heard what you said

36:12.129 --> 36:16.257
to Xo about not moving in.

This isn't a joke. Stop smiling.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.976
You're right.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.560
I did say you and Xiomara

36:27.560 --> 36:30.856
shouldn't live together

36:27.560 --> 36:30.856
before you're married. Hm?

36:30.856 --> 36:34.400
to sabotage.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.678
that I wanted to do things

36:58.383 --> 37:01.678
differently this time.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.764
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

37:01.678 --> 37:04.764

We've been through

37:20.363 --> 37:23.783
so much together

and so much without each other.

37:27.037 --> 37:29.206
And life is beautiful and hard,

37:29.206 --> 37:31.541
and the only thing

37:29.206 --> 37:31.541
I know for sure

37:31.541 --> 37:35.212
is that I want to go

37:31.541 --> 37:35.212
through it all with you.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.674
I had Botox this morning,

40:12.202 --> 40:14.120
<i>You know, the kind</i>

40:14.120 --> 40:16.664
<i>that goes on forever.</i>

40:16.664 --> 40:18.750
<i>Well, who knows?</i>

40:18.750 --> 40:22.295
<i>But it certainly was</i>

40:18.750 --> 40:22.295
<i>a night of possibilities...</i>

40:23.380 --> 40:26.132
<i>...for some people.</i>

40:29.594 --> 40:31.388
PETRA ( on recording ):

40:29.594 --> 40:31.388
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>

40:29.594 --> 40:31.388
<i>Petra Solano.</i>

40:31.388 --> 40:33.806
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

40:31.388 --> 40:33.806
( voicemail beeps )

40:33.806 --> 40:36.226
Hey, um...

40:36.226 --> 40:41.480
Look, I know when you

40:36.226 --> 40:41.480
asked me before, I denied it,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.858
but the truth is...

40:43.858 --> 40:45.902
I do have feelings for you.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.947
And I know you are with Chuck...

40:48.947 --> 40:51.783
but I don't know,

40:48.947 --> 40:51.783
I guess I'm calling

40:51.783 --> 40:54.035
because I wanted to say,

40:51.783 --> 40:54.035
before it's too late,

40:54.035 --> 40:55.703
that you shouldn't be.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.832
You should be with me.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.043
I loved Scott.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.129
Like I be telling you,

41:02.043 --> 41:04.129
I wouldn't kill him.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.880
I would want to kill

41:04.129 --> 41:05.880
whoever killed him.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.174
Rrrrrip them to pieces.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.174
Ooh, that's enough.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.137
So there's nothing

41:09.634 --> 41:12.137
you're not telling us?

41:14.847 --> 41:17.642
Scott's burn book

41:14.847 --> 41:17.642
mentioned someone named J.P.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.352
Do those initials

41:17.642 --> 41:19.352
mean anything to you?

41:19.352 --> 41:21.354
Oh, you mean Jerky Pants?

41:21.354 --> 41:22.730
What?

41:22.730 --> 41:25.775
J.P. is short

41:22.730 --> 41:25.775
for Jerky Pants.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.860
It's what we used

41:25.775 --> 41:27.860
to call the horrible man

41:27.860 --> 41:29.321
who wanted to buy

41:27.860 --> 41:29.321
hotel next door

41:29.321 --> 41:31.614
because he was always eating

41:29.321 --> 41:31.614
jerky of the gators.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.241
Wait.

41:33.241 --> 41:36.119
Chuck Chesser is J.P.?

41:36.119 --> 41:37.996
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

41:36.119 --> 41:37.996
<i>Oh, no, but Chuck is with...</i>

41:37.996 --> 41:40.123
<i>( suspenseful theme playing )</i>

41:44.169 --> 41:48.006
<i>Like I said,</i>

41:44.169 --> 41:48.006
<i>people can surprise you.</i>

41:48.923 --> 41:50.675
<i>( keyboard clacking )</i>

41:52.718 --> 41:56.764
