17:50.502 --> 17:52.471
You guys had the fort
down. Don't be going there.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.474
That's an employee-employer
relationship.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.644
But she's just
opinionated as [bleep].

17:58.677 --> 18:01.181
I just didn't want my mom
doing anything on her birthday.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.282
Yeah, but she's-- she has a job.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.483
I'm glad you went and played.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.752
Is it a sport you're
gonna now pick up?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.120
- No.
- Not at all?

18:08.121 --> 18:09.756
- Not at all.
- You're gonna stick to rugby?

18:09.788 --> 18:14.594
Brock and my mom butt heads
over pretty much everything.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.364
My mom's a Taurus.
Brock's a Gemini.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.561
Here, why don't you
let me take her, baby?

18:19.562 --> 18:21.768
She might have another
extra burp from me.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.358
I know. We're gonna go burp.

18:23.359 --> 18:24.304
- [sighs heavily]
- [cries]

18:24.336 --> 18:25.838
It's just, like, oh, my God.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.740
You're doing my
head in. I can't.

18:30.376 --> 18:33.179
Sorry for leaving
you this morning.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.814
I was just, like,
overly exhausted,

18:34.847 --> 18:36.883
and, like, you went
to sleep before me,

18:36.915 --> 18:38.518
and you slept longer
than me, and I still hadn't

18:38.550 --> 18:40.528
taken my makeup off and--
- So you're upset with me

18:40.529 --> 18:41.354
because I sent to
sleep before you

18:41.387 --> 18:42.555
'cause you had makeup
on and you had to pump?

18:42.588 --> 18:44.691
Would you like me to take
your makeup off while you pump?

18:44.723 --> 18:47.160
'Cause I'm not pumping
out milk anytime soon.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.828
Did you really need
to go and practice,

18:49.863 --> 18:53.232
like, an hour early?
- Yes.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.500
I think you weren't
even remembering

18:54.534 --> 18:56.836
it was my mom's
birthday, and, like,

18:56.869 --> 18:58.709
her back's been bothering
her, and I just didn't want

18:58.710 --> 18:59.172
to ask her to,
like, do everything.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.507
So I was just frustrated.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.242
But you're frustrated
with everything,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.178
and then you just tie it to me.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.380
I don't want you to think
that I'm abandoning you.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.214
I don't want you to paint
a picture that I'm just this...

19:09.249 --> 19:11.651
- I did not--
- Brock, you're a sleeper

19:11.684 --> 19:14.220
that plays golf
and leaves his wife.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.387
I made one little
comment to Ariana.

19:15.422 --> 19:18.157
It's only effort, and all I
can control is my effort.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.124
I can't breastfeed.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.928
And I hate when you and my
mom butt heads. Like, it literally--

19:22.279 --> 19:23.663
Because I butt heads about this.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.833
- It hurts my soul.
<i>- You need to help yourself.</i>

19:26.865 --> 19:29.702
I still have a lot of hormones
pumping through me.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.770
If I keep hearing
"the hormones"...

19:31.805 --> 19:34.874
I think I get to use
this for another year.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.442
- [groans]
- [laughs]

19:37.309 --> 19:38.411
<i>Coming up...</i>

19:38.444 --> 19:40.313
For my entire life...

19:40.346 --> 19:41.580
[voice breaking] I feel
like I've never been able

19:41.614 --> 19:44.416
to, like, get to the point
where I feel super confident.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.252
Raquel, you can't dwell
on the past like that.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.622
How are you not
embarrassed by me?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.171
- [singsongy] Party time!
- Yeah!

20:05.204 --> 20:06.905
- Okay. All right.
- [cheering]

20:06.940 --> 20:08.641
All right. Here we go.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.440
- Whoo!
- Hold on. You guys,

20:11.769 --> 20:12.711
should we--what should
we-- should we go to the pool?

20:12.746 --> 20:13.579
Should we hang out?

20:13.613 --> 20:14.913
Guys, we should
do a toast right now.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.415
I would love to say something,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.916
but I should leave it to
the professional, right?

20:17.951 --> 20:19.285
Raquel, let's go.
What do we got?

20:19.318 --> 20:22.454
Tom. Ugh! I'm clearly
not the professional.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.923
- You're the professional.
- And, Raquel, like, uh,

20:23.957 --> 20:25.592
and, uh, here we go.
Here we go, here we go.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.693
Talk about today.
Talk about today.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.362
And Raquel.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.797
- Guys...
- Raquel.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.531
- You're putting pressure on me.
- Let's do a shot.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.465
- Raquel, Raquel, what? Wait.
- Yeah, it's too much pressure.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.901
You guys are so pushy.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.169
What are we toasting to, Raquel?

20:36.201 --> 20:41.540
Once I start anticipating
giving the speech,

20:41.574 --> 20:45.577
I feel like I go even
more, like, brain-dead.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.250
I'm grateful for this man.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.653
And cheers to that.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.520
- Yeah! Okay.
- I like it. That was perfect.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.756
- Okay, cool.
- That's honestly great.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.490
- That was solid. That was good.
- Yeah.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.661
I hope you guys are,
like, ready for tomorrow,

21:01.694 --> 21:05.498
for Our Chella. Get ready
for the [bleep] tomorrow.

21:05.531 --> 21:08.667
Everybody thinks
tomorrow is Our Chella,

21:08.701 --> 21:10.369
but it's actually the
letter "R" Chella,

21:10.403 --> 21:13.239
for "Rachella,"

21:13.272 --> 21:14.708
which is a bait and
switch at the house

21:14.740 --> 21:18.345
to really take people to
a surprise music festival.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.613
It culminates with a proposal.

21:20.646 --> 21:24.884
It's so crazy, but why
not swing for the fences?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.986
I'm gonna take a little
break, actually, I'm thinking.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.722
- Okay. I'll come with you.
- You're gonna come with me?

21:31.758 --> 21:33.759

21:33.792 --> 21:37.364
Why did I have to
pull the one block

21:37.396 --> 21:40.700
that said, "Make a toast"?

21:40.733 --> 21:41.800
You don't need
to worry about that,

21:41.835 --> 21:44.104
and you don't need to worry
about being embarrassed.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.739
For my entire life...

21:45.771 --> 21:47.240
[voice breaking] I feel

21:50.109 --> 21:51.711

of other people.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.878
But I understand where
you're coming from,

21:52.912 --> 21:54.646
and I understand
why you're so upset,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.615
and it makes me upset.
- Like, even if it is, like,

21:56.648 --> 21:58.751
my closest friends or, like...
- Right.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.488
people that I feel
comfortable around--

22:01.520 --> 22:02.521
But making a toast,
babe, is very different

22:02.555 --> 22:04.356
than talking to just
people. I think that you--

22:04.391 --> 22:06.588
You are a great
talker with your friends

22:06.589 --> 22:07.594
when you're chattin'.

22:07.626 --> 22:10.896
But, like, why can't I just,
like, say what I'm thinking?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.965
You know, that stems
back to your pageants

22:13.660 --> 22:14.299
and when you would
stumble on the question--

22:14.334 --> 22:16.568
No, I know, but,
like, growing up,

22:16.603 --> 22:18.637
I would never raise
my hand in class.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.739
- You know?
- Yeah.

22:21.740 --> 22:25.778
And I feel like that, like,
took a toll on my confidence.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.798
Raquel, you can't dwell
on the past like that,

22:27.799 --> 22:28.847
and you can't just think

22:28.882 --> 22:30.828
because you didn't
raise your hand in school

22:30.829 --> 22:31.417
and you were
quiet your whole life,

22:31.451 --> 22:33.952
that you have to
be like that forever,

22:33.987 --> 22:35.387
and it sounds to me
that you don't want to be.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.588
- I don't want to be like that.
- You don't!

22:36.623 --> 22:38.525
So then let's work
on it. Let's work on it

22:38.557 --> 22:39.959
and get better at it.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.930
I feel like being around
someone like Lala

in every single thing

22:46.598 --> 22:48.667

22:51.104 --> 22:52.806
Yeah. I can see that.

James and Lala
have a lot in common.

on their summer bodies.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.490
Wait. Are you pregnant?

23:03.829 --> 23:05.585
They both speak their mind

23:05.617 --> 23:07.386

23:07.420 --> 23:09.288
about what other
people think about them.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.970
Loud and obnoxious
about everything.

you say that, honestly.

I can't even give
a proper toast.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.910
What the [bleep] is that?

"Cheers, everyone.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.950
So happy we're
having fun tonight"?

23:36.982 --> 23:39.118

23:42.122 --> 23:44.490
I've been trying to
step out of my box.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.526
The whole reason
why I do anything in life

23:46.558 --> 23:48.528

of my comfort zone.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

23:50.329 --> 23:54.334

embarrassed by me?

make fun speeches
