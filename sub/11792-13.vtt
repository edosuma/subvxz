WEBVTT

00:00.649 --> 00:01.414
Previously on nip/tuck...

00:02.082 --> 00:02.748
Why are you with me,

00:02.816 --> 00:04.415
Christian? You think I'm stupid.

00:04.483 --> 00:06.613
You hate yourself like I do.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.845
I always go back to you because

00:08.912 --> 00:11.342
you hate me the best.

00:11.410 --> 00:12.307
Will you marry me?

00:12.375 --> 00:13.574
Christian loves you, and he

00:13.641 --> 00:15.906
is faithful to you.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.503
I don't know who he is.

00:17.571 --> 00:19.303
I don't know who I am.

00:20.369 --> 00:21.331
We're bad. Like, this is

00:21.399 --> 00:22.296
really bad.

00:22.363 --> 00:24.162
Heck if I don't feel guilty.

00:24.230 --> 00:24.896
Curtis?

00:25.665 --> 00:26.430
I got to tell you, I was

00:26.498 --> 00:27.261
a little shocked when I heard

00:27.329 --> 00:28.293
you won the Poland award. We're

00:28.360 --> 00:29.493
lucky, though, you know, Sean?

00:29.561 --> 00:30.960
Most poor bastards, they never

00:31.028 --> 00:32.194
get to find out what their true

00:32.262 --> 00:34.193
purpose in life is.

00:40.363 --> 00:41.693
Usually, we ask our new

00:41.761 --> 00:42.990
clients what they don't like

00:43.057 --> 00:44.390
about themselves, but in this

00:44.458 --> 00:45.790
case, I think we can figure it

00:45.858 --> 00:47.390
out.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.457
What happened? Car accident?

00:49.525 --> 00:52.824
Physics. 170 pound man falls

00:52.892 --> 00:54.891
245 feet, quickly reaching

00:54.958 --> 00:56.525
a maximum velocity of 86 miles

00:56.592 --> 00:57.692
an hour before he hits the water

00:57.759 --> 00:59.825
4 seconds later... which, I know,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.092
doesn't sound like a long time.

01:01.159 --> 01:02.992
But it's a frickin' eternity.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.293
And was this a suicide

01:04.360 --> 01:05.025
attempt?

01:05.093 --> 01:06.694
Yeah, at the most cliched

01:06.762 --> 01:07.728
spot on the planet... the golden

01:07.796 --> 01:08.395
Gate bridge.

01:08.463 --> 01:09.762
And you survived the fall.

01:09.830 --> 01:13.397
You... must be one in a million.

01:13.464 --> 01:14.998
Close. About 1,200 people

01:15.065 --> 01:16.665
have jumped from the bridge.

01:16.733 --> 01:17.699
Conservative estimate...

01:17.767 --> 01:19.100
the current's so strong there,

01:19.168 --> 01:20.001
they assume more than that have

01:20.068 --> 01:20.935
jumped without being seen, have

01:21.002 --> 01:22.602
been swept out to sea or taken

01:22.670 --> 01:24.437
by sharks. Only about 40 of us

01:24.504 --> 01:27.606
have lived to tell the tale.

01:27.673 --> 01:29.273
Why'd you do it?

01:29.341 --> 01:30.908
Uh, what my partner means is,

01:30.976 --> 01:32.209
we're going to need a complete

01:32.277 --> 01:33.910
psychological picture before we

01:33.978 --> 01:35.112
can agree to operate on you.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.079
I don't mind talking about

01:36.147 --> 01:38.247
it.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.548
I'm as sane as the next guy. My

01:39.616 --> 01:41.517
psychiatrist agrees.

01:44.387 --> 01:46.217
You ever try and kill yourself?

01:46.285 --> 01:48.451
No.

01:48.519 --> 01:50.787
Uh, what about you, Dr. Troy?

01:50.855 --> 01:52.856
You know, I've had, uh, rough

01:52.923 --> 01:54.023
patches, but I guess I've always

01:54.091 --> 01:56.792
been able to... find pleasure in

01:56.860 --> 01:58.126
my life somehow.

01:58.194 --> 02:00.194
Well, that's lucky. Yeah.

02:00.262 --> 02:01.628
I guess I'm just kind of

02:01.696 --> 02:03.663
a naturally depressive

02:03.731 --> 02:05.731
personality. I guess,

02:05.799 --> 02:10.501
obvious. Just... life's just been

02:10.568 --> 02:14.437
kind of hard for a while.

02:14.505 --> 02:18.573
My son died of leukemia. He was

02:18.641 --> 02:20.341
14 years old. You know,

02:20.409 --> 02:21.409
marriages don't survive that

02:21.477 --> 02:23.711
kind of thing. I just felt this

02:23.779 --> 02:25.779
kind of darkness building up

02:25.847 --> 02:29.247
inside me. The edges of it

02:29.315 --> 02:31.616
disappeared, and it felt like

02:31.684 --> 02:36.386
it kind of swallowed me up.

02:36.454 --> 02:37.553
Wasn't even painful anymore.

02:37.621 --> 02:40.856
Everything just was so hard.

02:40.923 --> 02:42.724
Except jumping. Jumping

02:42.791 --> 02:45.225
was easy. I remember, I didn't

02:45.292 --> 02:46.526
want anybody to see me go over

02:46.593 --> 02:48.027
the rail... like I didn't want to

02:48.094 --> 02:51.529
get in trouble somehow.

02:51.597 --> 02:52.630
And I went over the rail, and

02:52.698 --> 02:54.697
there's a lip, and I stood

02:54.765 --> 02:56.162
there, and then, I just

02:56.230 --> 02:57.463
stepped... I mean, the way, you

02:57.531 --> 02:59.363
know, you step out of bed in

02:59.430 --> 03:01.362
the morning, I stepped.

03:06.128 --> 03:07.661
And I thought to my self, "no,

03:07.729 --> 03:09.127
not this. Go back. Stop. Go

03:09.195 --> 03:10.794
back!"

03:13.061 --> 03:14.326
By second 2, I knew I wanted

03:14.394 --> 03:15.959
to live. I've never been so sure

03:16.027 --> 03:19.562
of anything in my life.

03:19.630 --> 03:20.730
What did you do?

03:20.798 --> 03:23.132
Um, well, most of the people

03:23.200 --> 03:24.333
who've survived landed feet

03:24.401 --> 03:26.802
first. So I somehow managed to

03:26.870 --> 03:28.670
flip myself over and hit

03:28.738 --> 03:31.440
the water like a blade of grass.

03:31.507 --> 03:33.174
And it still felt like

03:33.242 --> 03:34.609
a cinderblock to the balls,

03:34.677 --> 03:36.977
though.

03:37.044 --> 03:39.212
Broke 2 vertebrae in my pelvis

03:39.280 --> 03:40.380
and, you know, obviously,

03:40.447 --> 03:42.181
the reason I'm here.

03:42.249 --> 03:43.715
Broke all 14 bones in your

03:43.783 --> 03:46.384
face, but your jaw is remarkably

03:46.451 --> 03:50.420
intact. Uh, Mr. Seabrook, we may

03:50.487 --> 03:52.254
not be able to make you look

03:52.322 --> 03:53.622
the way you looked before.

03:53.690 --> 03:55.357
I don't care about that.

03:55.425 --> 03:58.227
I just want to look normal.

03:58.295 --> 03:59.728
Jumping gave me a second chance

03:59.796 --> 04:01.296
to live my life, to follow my

04:01.364 --> 04:03.932
dreams. I want to go back to

04:03.999 --> 04:05.266
school, maybe become

04:05.334 --> 04:09.037
a therapist, start dating again.

04:09.105 --> 04:12.742
You know, maybe, uh...

04:15.880 --> 04:17.814
Maybe have another kid.

04:21.420 --> 04:25.890
You must be in a lot of pain.

04:25.958 --> 04:28.226
You know how they say when

04:28.294 --> 04:29.260
you die, your life flashes

04:29.328 --> 04:30.562
before your eyes? It's not

04:30.629 --> 04:34.299
true. You don't see all

04:34.367 --> 04:36.535
the things you've done. You see

04:36.602 --> 04:37.402
all the things you're never

04:37.470 --> 04:40.572
going to get a chance to do,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.275
all the opportunities you're

04:42.342 --> 04:45.645
going to lose. I didn't jump to

04:45.712 --> 04:48.748
my death. I jumped to my life.

04:48.815 --> 04:49.649
I just need you to help me to

04:49.716 --> 04:51.650
live it.

Oh. Baby, that feels so good.

06:01.974 --> 06:03.508
Ok. Come inside me.

06:03.576 --> 06:04.111
Well...

06:06.812 --> 06:08.379
Aren't you...

06:08.446 --> 06:10.046
No. I mean, no. I'm good.

06:10.114 --> 06:12.047
I don't need to. You do it.

06:17.618 --> 06:20.419
Come on.

06:23.155 --> 06:26.926
Oh! Oh, oh, my gosh, Sean!

06:26.993 --> 06:31.434
Oh! Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God.

06:31.502 --> 06:33.774
That was insane. Mmm.

06:37.181 --> 06:39.614
That was weird.

06:39.682 --> 06:41.849
Why?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.688
I'm not used to you not coming.

06:45.756 --> 06:49.224
I don't always need to come.

06:49.292 --> 06:52.026
Well... I do.

06:52.094 --> 06:53.795
Mmm. Honey, we're married.

06:53.863 --> 06:55.230
We have, like, a lifetime of

06:55.297 --> 06:58.433
orgasms ahead of us. We're good.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.436
It's good.

07:06.448 --> 07:07.214
Oh.

07:07.282 --> 07:10.583
Mmm.

07:10.651 --> 07:11.784
Why stay with him?

07:11.852 --> 07:13.285
Are you suggesting that you

07:13.353 --> 07:14.019
and i...

07:14.087 --> 07:17.720
No. I want to know. Why stay

07:17.787 --> 07:18.853
with him, if it makes you so

07:18.921 --> 07:19.587
unhappy?

07:19.655 --> 07:22.089
I don't know. The same reason

07:22.157 --> 07:24.090
you do, I guess.

07:31.163 --> 07:31.829
Kind of feel sorry for

07:31.897 --> 07:34.431
the guy, huh? Unlucky bastard.

07:34.499 --> 07:35.799
He survived a fall from

07:35.867 --> 07:37.334
the golden Gate bridge. How is

07:37.401 --> 07:38.201
that unlucky?

07:38.269 --> 07:39.502
He went from being depressed

07:39.570 --> 07:40.904
and suicidal to completely

07:40.971 --> 07:43.006
delusional in 700 feet. He

07:43.074 --> 07:43.907
really thinks he's going to

07:43.975 --> 07:45.108
change his life now.

07:45.176 --> 07:46.643
And you don't believe him.

07:46.710 --> 07:47.510
How many times have you sworn

07:47.578 --> 07:48.578
off drinking and then wake up

07:48.646 --> 07:49.579
with a hangover? Same thing,

07:49.646 --> 07:50.646
right?

07:50.714 --> 07:51.813
Having a hangover and

07:51.881 --> 07:53.147
attempting suicide are not

07:53.215 --> 07:53.914
the same thing.

07:53.982 --> 07:55.783
You would know, I guess.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.718
What's that supposed to mean?

07:57.785 --> 07:58.618
I'm just saying that people

07:58.686 --> 07:59.686
don't change just because they

07:59.754 --> 08:00.720
think they're going to die and

08:00.788 --> 08:01.988
then get a second chance.

08:02.055 --> 08:03.389
You had cancer. You thought

08:03.456 --> 08:04.790
you were going to die. You're

08:04.857 --> 08:05.690
saying that didn't give you

08:05.758 --> 08:06.691
the courage to look at life

08:06.759 --> 08:07.758
a little differently?

08:07.826 --> 08:08.926
For about a week, yeah,

08:08.994 --> 08:10.294
maybe. All right?

08:10.362 --> 08:11.061
I think there's no way you

08:11.129 --> 08:12.462
can't change after something

08:12.530 --> 08:13.129
like that.

08:13.197 --> 08:15.064
So tell me, how is your life

08:15.132 --> 08:16.465
so different since you swam out

08:16.533 --> 08:18.468
to the buoy?

08:22.074 --> 08:22.974
At a certain age, you just

08:23.041 --> 08:23.908
accept who you are and stop

08:23.975 --> 08:24.775
thinking there's something

08:24.843 --> 08:26.409
better out there.

08:26.477 --> 08:28.911
You're right. You haven't

08:28.979 --> 08:30.478
changed at all. You married

08:30.546 --> 08:32.113
Kimber, and you still screw

08:32.181 --> 08:33.815
around every chance you get.

08:33.883 --> 08:34.615
Which reminds me, I was

08:34.683 --> 08:35.349
having lunch at shutters

08:35.417 --> 08:37.150
the other day, picked up these

08:37.217 --> 08:38.652
2 hot sisters who both want to

08:38.719 --> 08:40.285
go up 2 cup sizes. They're

08:40.354 --> 08:41.720
coming in on Thursday.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.087
Unbelievably hot, trust me. I

08:44.155 --> 08:44.922
told them that'd be cool. Is

08:44.990 --> 08:48.026
that cool with you?

08:48.093 --> 08:49.294
Why don't you finish up here?

08:49.361 --> 08:50.361
I forgot. I have a meeting i

08:50.429 --> 08:53.465
need to get to.

08:53.532 --> 08:55.467
We have a consult after this.

08:58.673 --> 08:59.673
Tell me what you don't like

08:59.741 --> 09:02.676
about yourself, Mr. Wise.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.010
Uh, don't get the wrong idea.

09:04.078 --> 09:07.079
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.015
Mr. Wise, the gash

09:10.083 --> 09:12.017
around your neck was clearly

09:12.085 --> 09:14.854
made by a belt, probably spiked,

09:14.921 --> 09:16.255
from the sharp indentations left

09:16.323 --> 09:18.390
at perfectly spaced intervals.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.092
The skin's been ripped and

09:20.160 --> 09:21.227
twisted. Not a surprising

09:21.294 --> 09:22.294
consequence when you try to hang

09:22.362 --> 09:23.262
yourself.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.264
Kudos, Sherlock.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.904
Spiked belt it was, although you

09:30.972 --> 09:31.805
haven't solved the case just

09:31.872 --> 09:34.307
yet. I wasn't trying to commit

09:34.375 --> 09:38.614
suicide. I was masturbating.

09:38.682 --> 09:42.384
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

09:42.452 --> 09:46.754
Gone awry. My bad. I just need

09:46.822 --> 09:49.091
you to fix this so that I can

09:49.159 --> 09:49.959
stop wearing scarves and

09:50.027 --> 09:51.361
turtlenecks when it's 80 degrees

09:51.429 --> 09:52.128
outside.

09:52.196 --> 09:53.730
I liked you better when i

09:53.797 --> 09:54.530
thought you tried to kill

09:54.598 --> 09:58.000
yourself. You risk dying for

09:58.068 --> 09:58.834
an orgasm?

09:58.902 --> 10:00.102
It wasn't just an orgasm, it

10:00.170 --> 10:02.204
was the orgasm of a lifetime.

10:02.271 --> 10:03.405
You have no idea.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.008
Cutting off

10:06.075 --> 10:07.977
the blood supply to the brain

10:08.045 --> 10:10.080
provides an amazing high. I do

10:10.147 --> 10:10.781
have an idea.

10:10.848 --> 10:11.748
It's better than any drug

10:11.816 --> 10:14.518
you've ever had... I've ever had.

10:14.586 --> 10:15.786
Includes quite

10:15.854 --> 10:16.753
an extensive list, I can tell

10:16.821 --> 10:19.122
you. Don't knock it if you ain't

10:19.190 --> 10:19.957
tried it, doc.

10:20.024 --> 10:21.591
Thanks, but, you know, I can

10:21.659 --> 10:22.625
usually find someone to help me

10:22.693 --> 10:24.093
out. Call it the perks of being

10:24.161 --> 10:24.928
married.

10:24.995 --> 10:27.063
Oh. Right. Been there.

10:27.131 --> 10:27.897
Divorced now. Look, all I'm

10:27.965 --> 10:29.332
saying is, you cut off the flow

10:29.400 --> 10:30.266
of blood and oxygen to

10:30.334 --> 10:32.101
the brain, your dick gets

10:32.169 --> 10:33.903
unbelievably hard. That's why

10:33.971 --> 10:34.670
these guys who are hung get

10:34.738 --> 10:36.405
these huge, stonking boners and

10:36.473 --> 10:37.940
ejaculate when they die. It's

10:38.008 --> 10:39.442
called induced...

10:39.509 --> 10:40.776
induced cerebral anoxia.

10:40.844 --> 10:41.777
I know.

10:41.845 --> 10:44.480
That's right. You get this

10:44.548 --> 10:47.750
euphoria. It's like

10:47.818 --> 10:52.721
having one foot in heaven.

10:52.789 --> 10:53.722
So, I take it you're going to

10:53.790 --> 10:55.257
continue with this practice even

10:55.325 --> 10:57.992
after i, uh, repair the damage

10:58.060 --> 10:58.759
to your neck?

10:58.827 --> 11:00.394
Don't worry, doc.

11:00.461 --> 11:01.595
I'll stick to silk ties from now

11:01.662 --> 11:03.296
on. Same high without the ring

11:03.364 --> 11:07.299
around the collar.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.167
Look, I'm asking you to fix

11:08.234 --> 11:11.470
this, not how I choose to come.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.007
Judge not, right?

11:25.456 --> 11:26.222
Excuse me.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.390
May I help you?

11:27.457 --> 11:28.324
Yeah. I'm looking for

11:28.391 --> 11:29.258
Dr. Ryerson.

11:29.325 --> 11:30.525
Is he expecting you?

11:30.593 --> 11:31.459
We spoke earlier on

11:31.527 --> 11:33.460
the phone. I'm Sean McNamara.

11:33.528 --> 11:36.463
Oh! Dr. Mcnamara. Yes. I'm

11:36.531 --> 11:38.198
nsolo. Curtis told me you were

11:38.265 --> 11:40.566
coming by. You and your partner

11:40.634 --> 11:41.567
were the other recipients of

11:41.635 --> 11:42.702
the other Poland award this

11:42.769 --> 11:45.537
year. Congratulations. Follow

11:45.605 --> 11:47.939
me, please.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.742
Hey! Sean, thanks for coming.

11:50.809 --> 11:51.776
Hey, how was your drive?

11:51.844 --> 11:52.710
Just fine.

11:52.778 --> 11:53.510
Good.

11:53.578 --> 11:54.211
Let me know if there's

11:54.279 --> 11:55.045
anything you need while in

11:55.113 --> 11:57.614
San Diego, anything at all.

11:57.682 --> 12:00.717
Thanks.

12:00.784 --> 12:01.817
Nsolo stepped on a land mine

12:01.885 --> 12:04.687
in Angola. He was a beggar at

12:04.755 --> 12:05.821
the airport when we met him,

12:05.889 --> 12:07.656
and now, he practically runs

12:07.724 --> 12:08.691
the entire center when I'm on

12:08.759 --> 12:09.625
the road, which is about

12:09.693 --> 12:10.726
10 months out of the year.

12:10.794 --> 12:11.827
Well, I'm glad you were in

12:11.895 --> 12:12.928
town. I've been wanting to see

12:12.996 --> 12:14.529
your operation since we talked

12:14.597 --> 12:15.264
in Miami.

12:15.331 --> 12:16.898
Well, here it is, in all its

12:16.966 --> 12:19.401
glamour. Not exactly Beverly

12:19.469 --> 12:20.836
Hills, but...

12:20.903 --> 12:23.305
That's a good thing.

12:23.372 --> 12:26.207
So, uh...

12:26.275 --> 12:27.709
What's going on with Christian?

12:27.777 --> 12:29.077
Oh, he's still sucking

12:29.145 --> 12:30.578
the champagne and caviar out of

12:30.646 --> 12:31.513
life.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.647
After the ceremony, you guys

12:32.715 --> 12:33.782
took off so quickly, I thought

12:33.849 --> 12:34.449
maybe...

12:34.517 --> 12:35.183
sorry about that, Curtis. I

12:35.251 --> 12:36.017
had to jump on the next flight.

12:36.085 --> 12:37.152
There was an emergency back at

12:37.220 --> 12:38.219
the office. So...

12:38.287 --> 12:39.321
I cannot tell you how many

12:39.388 --> 12:40.589
trips I've had to cut short and

12:40.656 --> 12:44.059
hop on a plane. I remember once,

12:44.127 --> 12:45.126
crop duster came and picked us

12:45.194 --> 12:46.628
up on the serengeti on the way

12:46.696 --> 12:50.565
to a malaria outbreak in darfur.

12:50.633 --> 12:52.467
An angry herd of wildebeests

12:52.535 --> 12:54.102
chases us down the runway, I kid

12:54.170 --> 12:55.570
you not. Barely got out of there

12:55.638 --> 12:56.238
with our necks.

12:56.305 --> 12:59.007
Wow. The closest

12:59.075 --> 13:00.141
I've come to anything like that

13:00.209 --> 13:01.910
would be bumper-to-bumper on

13:01.977 --> 13:03.612
the 405 with Christian, who's in

13:03.679 --> 13:04.879
a bad mood 'cause he's late for

13:04.947 --> 13:05.780
his massage.

13:07.116 --> 13:11.152
That's why I called you.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.788
I'm here because... I want to

13:13.856 --> 13:18.226
help. So what can I do?

13:18.294 --> 13:19.527
Well, we are flying

13:19.595 --> 13:20.929
a 12-year-old girl in from

13:20.996 --> 13:24.065
Jakarta on Thursday. Her husband

13:24.132 --> 13:25.066
cut her in the face with

13:25.133 --> 13:26.333
a machete when she fought off

13:26.401 --> 13:29.302
his rape attempt. What we need

13:29.370 --> 13:32.072
is a surgeon and an o.r.

13:32.139 --> 13:33.406
Consider it done.

13:33.474 --> 13:37.243
You sure about this?

13:37.311 --> 13:39.378
I mean, maybe think about it,

13:39.446 --> 13:40.213
talk to Christian.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.214
No, I don't need to talk to

13:41.281 --> 13:43.049
Christian. Just something I want

13:43.117 --> 13:44.484
to do, something I probably

13:44.552 --> 13:45.485
should have done a long time

13:45.553 --> 13:49.422
ago.

13:49.490 --> 13:50.389
All right. Well, I'll set it

13:50.457 --> 13:52.091
up for Thursday.

13:52.159 --> 13:53.626
Great.

13:53.694 --> 13:54.561
This is really going to make

13:54.628 --> 13:56.563
a difference, Sean.

14:02.826 --> 14:06.628
What are you doing?

14:06.696 --> 14:08.763
I want to make my baby happy.

14:09.899 --> 14:12.799
If my baby's not happy, then

14:12.867 --> 14:17.269
I'm not happy.

14:17.337 --> 14:18.603
I'm half asleep...

14:18.671 --> 14:22.441
look, just tell me what you

14:22.508 --> 14:26.677
want. Anything.

14:26.745 --> 14:29.747
I want you... don't worry

14:29.814 --> 14:30.848
about me. I'm fine.

14:30.915 --> 14:32.849
You don't seem fine to me.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.457
Come on.

14:44.197 --> 14:45.798
Ahh.

14:45.866 --> 14:46.633
Mmm.

14:46.701 --> 14:48.636
Ohh.

14:51.872 --> 14:53.706
Yeah. Get it, baby.

14:53.774 --> 14:55.575
Oh. What are you doing?

14:55.642 --> 14:56.509
Oh, trust me. Trust me. Trust

14:56.577 --> 14:58.911
me. Trust me. Trust me, baby.

14:58.979 --> 14:59.912
You got to trust me, ok? You're

14:59.980 --> 15:00.680
going to have the come of your

15:00.748 --> 15:03.683
life, I promise. Ok.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.622
Trust me.

15:17.897 --> 15:18.497
Oh.

15:18.564 --> 15:19.364
Look at me. Look at me. You

15:19.432 --> 15:20.665
got to trust me.

15:20.732 --> 15:22.601
Oh.

15:22.669 --> 15:23.268
Ok?

15:23.336 --> 15:24.905
Ok.

15:28.143 --> 15:29.677
Oh.

15:29.745 --> 15:30.845
Oh.

15:30.913 --> 15:32.847
Oh! Oh!

15:32.915 --> 15:34.882
Oh, my God!

15:44.727 --> 15:46.727
Oh!

15:46.795 --> 15:47.762
Oh, my God.

15:47.829 --> 15:50.664
Yeah. Yeah.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.100
That's my baby.

16:02.141 --> 16:04.042
Next time, you do me, baby.

16:05.578 --> 16:07.513
Oh.

16:20.294 --> 16:21.962
Sorry, partner. I was

16:22.029 --> 16:23.597
performing a slipindicktomy.

16:24.865 --> 16:26.666
Are we in high school? You

16:26.734 --> 16:28.101
have to brag about having sex

16:28.169 --> 16:29.603
with your wife?

16:29.671 --> 16:31.104
We are not talking about sex,

16:31.172 --> 16:32.973
partner. I gave Kimmie

16:33.041 --> 16:35.208
the orgasm of her lifetime, ok?

16:35.276 --> 16:37.010
I mean, Kimmie's toes curled up

16:37.077 --> 16:38.278
like the wicked witch of

16:38.345 --> 16:39.912
the east, and it's all because

16:39.980 --> 16:42.581
of Mr. Wise in there. Seriously.

16:42.649 --> 16:43.516
I mean, we were having marital

16:43.584 --> 16:44.550
problems. The sex was all, you

16:44.618 --> 16:45.952
know, whatever. Anyway, I took

16:46.019 --> 16:47.987
his advice and tried erotic

16:48.055 --> 16:49.789
asphyxiation.

16:49.857 --> 16:51.424
You choked your wife?

16:51.492 --> 16:52.692
Ok, come on. It's not like

16:52.760 --> 16:53.627
I'm o.j. Or something, all

16:53.695 --> 16:54.662
right? I know how to deal with

16:54.729 --> 16:55.930
the pressure. I'm a doctor.

16:55.998 --> 16:57.032
Oh, you're right. That's very

16:57.100 --> 16:57.833
romantic.

16:57.901 --> 16:59.632
Trust me. Kimber loved it.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.398
Not as much as you did,

17:00.466 --> 17:01.066
though.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.635
What's that supposed to mean?

17:02.702 --> 17:03.568
Everything is about power for

17:03.636 --> 17:06.532
you. You're not satisfied unless

17:06.599 --> 17:08.631
you're dominating your partner.

17:08.698 --> 17:09.663
You live your life with your

17:09.731 --> 17:10.595
hand on her throat, might as

17:10.663 --> 17:11.528
well screw her that way, too,

17:11.596 --> 17:12.262
right?

17:12.328 --> 17:13.028
Jeez, what's up your ass

17:13.096 --> 17:13.762
today, huh?

17:13.829 --> 17:14.628
Kimber deserves better than

17:14.696 --> 17:16.431
this. You know, if you're having

17:16.498 --> 17:17.531
problems, why don't you try

17:17.598 --> 17:18.266
talking about it?

17:18.333 --> 17:19.267
Ok, Mr. Marriage counselor

17:19.334 --> 17:20.467
guy. Ok. You're giving me

17:20.535 --> 17:22.502
advice, right? Last time I

17:22.569 --> 17:23.536
checked, you've been divorced...

17:23.604 --> 17:24.737
how many times? Same as me,

17:24.805 --> 17:26.238
right? And since when do you

17:26.306 --> 17:28.040
care about Kimber so much?

17:28.942 --> 17:30.642
Guys, are you clean enough?

17:30.710 --> 17:31.477
The guy's been under for

17:31.544 --> 17:34.813
6 minutes.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.008
Hey.

18:09.075 --> 18:11.309
Sean... Sean...

18:11.377 --> 18:12.277
no, no, no, no.

18:12.345 --> 18:13.111
No...

18:13.179 --> 18:14.279
don't talk. Don't talk.

18:16.048 --> 18:17.148
Ow. Mmm.

18:17.216 --> 18:18.316
Isn't that what you like now?

18:18.384 --> 18:20.252
No.

18:20.319 --> 18:22.120
Sean. Sean!

18:22.187 --> 18:24.722
Ugh! Sean, stop it!

18:24.790 --> 18:28.425
Jesus.

18:28.493 --> 18:31.028
Kimber...

18:31.095 --> 18:33.030
Hey, look. I know about

18:33.097 --> 18:34.164
the choking. He told me. I just

18:34.232 --> 18:35.666
want to know if you're ok.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.333
It's fine. It's not as bad as

18:37.401 --> 18:39.002
it looks.

18:39.069 --> 18:42.138
Oh.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.073
You should get somebody to look

18:43.140 --> 18:44.808
at that, you know?

18:44.876 --> 18:49.046
Sean, stop it. I really...

18:49.114 --> 18:50.347
i really don't want you to touch

18:50.415 --> 18:52.348
me right now, ok?

18:58.754 --> 19:01.589
I came here because we need to

19:01.656 --> 19:04.691
stop doing this.

19:09.129 --> 19:12.764
Ok.

19:12.832 --> 19:16.768
Ok? Just ok?

19:16.835 --> 19:17.969
What do you want me to say?

19:18.036 --> 19:20.004
"Stay, we can work it out"?

19:20.071 --> 19:20.904
Well, I would have thought

19:20.972 --> 19:21.872
maybe you'd have a little bit

19:21.940 --> 19:24.141
more feeling than that, or for

19:24.208 --> 19:24.841
me.

19:24.909 --> 19:25.642
It's never what this was

19:25.709 --> 19:28.911
about. You know that.

19:33.015 --> 19:35.783
Ok. Then I guess that's it.

19:41.589 --> 19:42.822
You're not going back to him,

19:42.890 --> 19:43.489
are you?

19:43.557 --> 19:44.623
He's my husband, Sean.

19:44.691 --> 19:47.226
You deserve better.

19:47.293 --> 19:49.828
I know. And the only reason

19:49.896 --> 19:51.096
why I haven't been able to get

19:51.163 --> 19:52.630
it is because I'm fooling around

19:52.698 --> 19:55.599
with his best friend, and I am

19:55.667 --> 19:57.001
just as much to blame for my own

19:57.068 --> 19:58.969
unhappiness as anybody. And if

19:59.037 --> 20:01.137
I'm going to get what I deserve,

20:01.205 --> 20:02.138
i need to take a little bit of

20:02.206 --> 20:04.573
responsibility, refocus on my

20:04.641 --> 20:08.042
marriage... even if that means

20:08.110 --> 20:09.609
being completely honest with

20:09.677 --> 20:11.611
him.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.016
How long you been going

20:19.084 --> 20:20.350
behind my back, you cheating

20:20.418 --> 20:21.084
bastard?

20:24.355 --> 20:25.421
I come in this morning

20:25.489 --> 20:26.822
expecting to be waist-deep in

20:26.890 --> 20:29.424
double Ds. Instead, I find my

20:29.492 --> 20:31.059
2 bimbos out in the lobby trying

20:31.127 --> 20:31.793
to reschedule.

20:31.861 --> 20:33.027
Oh, cool your jets. We'll fit

20:33.095 --> 20:34.362
your bimbos in. And I promise,

20:34.429 --> 20:35.696
this operation won't cost you

20:35.764 --> 20:36.430
a Penny.

20:36.498 --> 20:37.464
Good to see you, Christian.

20:37.532 --> 20:38.265
I don't give a shit about

20:38.333 --> 20:39.433
the money. If you're operating

20:39.500 --> 20:40.267
on somebody who needs it, that's

20:40.334 --> 20:40.934
fine.

20:41.002 --> 20:42.102
There's a first.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.569
And... and what about him? I

20:43.637 --> 20:44.837
mean, where did he come from,

20:44.905 --> 20:46.105
huh? Last time we saw each

20:46.172 --> 20:47.339
other, you were too embarrassed

20:47.407 --> 20:49.374
to say good-bye, and now you're

20:49.441 --> 20:50.541
working together in our surgical

20:50.609 --> 20:51.275
suite.

20:51.343 --> 20:51.976
Curtis said he needed some

20:52.043 --> 20:53.577
help, and I jumped at

20:53.644 --> 20:54.244
the opportunity.

20:54.312 --> 20:55.011
And you just forgot to tell

20:55.079 --> 20:55.678
me.

20:55.746 --> 20:56.680
Frankly, I didn't think you'd

20:56.747 --> 20:57.347
care.

20:57.415 --> 20:59.519
Bullshit. You knew exactly

20:59.587 --> 21:02.423
what you were doing.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.491
Why don't you scrub in? You

21:03.559 --> 21:04.225
can help us with these grafts

21:04.295 --> 21:04.961
here.

21:05.029 --> 21:05.797
No, thank you, Curtis. I have

21:05.865 --> 21:06.700
no desire to be around Sean when

21:06.768 --> 21:07.703
he's got his tongue so far up

21:07.770 --> 21:09.709
your ass.

21:11.414 --> 21:14.650
Sorry about that.

21:14.717 --> 21:15.517
Guess you never got around to

21:15.585 --> 21:16.318
telling him you're going to be

21:16.385 --> 21:19.688
gone to Africa for a month, huh?

21:40.090 --> 21:42.190
Sorry to interrupt. We really do

21:42.258 --> 21:43.258
need to get a "do not disturb"

21:43.326 --> 21:44.792
sign on that door. You know,

21:44.860 --> 21:45.927
nurse Linda's come in a couple

21:45.995 --> 21:47.027
of times. She needs to take your

21:47.095 --> 21:48.062
vitals.

21:48.129 --> 21:51.765
That's fine. I'm through.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.332
You know, maybe you should go

21:53.400 --> 21:54.633
finish off in the bathroom.

21:54.701 --> 21:55.501
Really, it's not worth

21:55.568 --> 21:57.402
the effort. I've had farts that

21:57.470 --> 21:58.669
were more exciting.

22:01.307 --> 22:05.177
Why don't we take a look, huh?

22:15.722 --> 22:16.689
How's it look?

22:16.756 --> 22:19.491
Looks pretty good. Very good,

22:19.558 --> 22:22.360
in fact. How's the patient

22:22.428 --> 22:24.028
doing?

22:24.096 --> 22:25.563
Depressed.

22:25.630 --> 22:26.597
That's just the anesthesia

22:26.665 --> 22:28.433
wearing off. You'll be fine in

22:28.500 --> 22:29.167
a couple of days.

22:29.234 --> 22:31.969
Bullshit. I've been rubbing

22:32.037 --> 22:34.005
myself raw, fantasizing my ass

22:34.072 --> 22:35.874
off. Sex without asphyxiation is

22:35.941 --> 22:37.575
about as exciting as...

22:37.643 --> 22:39.143
a day without sunshine?

22:39.211 --> 22:42.014
Right. I forgot.

22:42.082 --> 22:43.683
You liked me better suicidal.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.517
Oh, no, no, no. I don't. I

22:44.584 --> 22:47.019
mean, I did, but...

22:47.087 --> 22:50.923
I don't.

22:50.991 --> 22:51.924
I've been having some trouble in

22:51.992 --> 22:53.526
my marriage, and I think you

22:53.593 --> 22:56.762
might have just... helped it.

22:56.829 --> 22:57.596
She was a little scared at

22:57.664 --> 22:59.164
first. Thought I was trying to

22:59.232 --> 23:01.199
choke her to death or something.

23:01.267 --> 23:02.401
And?

23:02.468 --> 23:05.070
It worked. It

23:05.138 --> 23:06.872
worked. Probably the greatest

23:06.940 --> 23:08.407
orgasm I've ever seen. I mean...

23:08.475 --> 23:09.308
And how was it when she did

23:09.376 --> 23:10.943
you? Blow your mind or what?

23:11.010 --> 23:13.011
No, no, no.

23:13.079 --> 23:13.778
I'm better at giving than

23:13.846 --> 23:14.846
receiving.

23:14.914 --> 23:15.680
Well, it depends what you're

23:15.748 --> 23:18.616
receiving.

23:18.684 --> 23:20.118
Believe me, if you want to

23:20.185 --> 23:21.552
discover your capacity for

23:21.620 --> 23:23.354
limitless ecstasy, go beyond

23:23.422 --> 23:25.089
what you ever thought possible,

23:25.157 --> 23:26.790
get her to return the favor.

23:26.858 --> 23:28.792
Your marriage will

23:28.860 --> 23:32.730
last forever.

23:32.797 --> 23:34.398
Well, I think the neck's

23:34.466 --> 23:36.600
coming along fine. As long as

23:36.668 --> 23:37.768
you stay off the windpipe for

23:37.836 --> 23:39.236
a couple of months, maybe

23:39.304 --> 23:43.174
forever, you'll be good.

23:43.241 --> 23:46.643
You know what it's like?

23:46.711 --> 23:49.746
To have experienced heaven, and

23:49.814 --> 23:53.920
now be denied entry?

23:53.988 --> 23:54.988
You know, I think I'll get

23:55.056 --> 23:55.955
you a couple of girl-on-girl

23:56.023 --> 23:57.557
action videos, so I'll talk to

23:57.624 --> 23:58.658
my anesthesiologist, get

23:58.726 --> 24:00.660
a recommendation.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.150
Hey, handsome.

24:23.218 --> 24:25.153
Hey, honey. I'm just going to

24:25.221 --> 24:26.389
jump on the treadmill before i

24:26.456 --> 24:27.524
get some dinner.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.525
Hey, not yet.

24:28.593 --> 24:31.026
Mm-hmm.

24:31.094 --> 24:31.993
What?

24:32.061 --> 24:33.693
Come over here.

24:33.761 --> 24:34.994
What?

24:35.061 --> 24:35.861
Sit.

24:35.928 --> 24:38.561
What are you doing? You look

24:38.629 --> 24:39.895
like a bitch in heat, Kimmie.

24:39.963 --> 24:40.895
Do i?

24:40.963 --> 24:41.829
Yeah.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.829
Well, I'm actually a tigress,

24:43.897 --> 24:46.362
and you are a tortoise.

24:46.429 --> 24:47.529
A tortoise?

24:47.597 --> 24:48.430
Mm-hmm.

24:48.497 --> 24:49.230
T'thas exciting.

24:49.298 --> 24:50.131
I've been reading the kama

24:50.199 --> 24:51.099
sutra book.

24:53.968 --> 24:55.502
You're not the only creative

24:55.570 --> 24:57.104
lover.

24:57.171 --> 25:00.640
Oh. I like creative, huh?

25:00.708 --> 25:01.975
Why don't you get me off like I

25:02.042 --> 25:03.678
got you off?

25:03.746 --> 25:06.080
Well, I'm not really into

25:06.148 --> 25:07.114
that sort of thing.

25:07.182 --> 25:08.683
Come on.

25:08.751 --> 25:09.618
Mm-mm.

25:09.685 --> 25:10.418
No?

25:10.486 --> 25:15.190
But I want you to lay back.

25:15.257 --> 25:17.192
Right here.

25:20.262 --> 25:22.996
Spread your legs.

25:33.170 --> 25:33.770
Mm.

25:33.838 --> 25:34.504
Oh.

25:34.572 --> 25:37.007
Oh.

25:39.610 --> 25:42.679
Give me your hands.

25:42.747 --> 25:44.681
Mmm.

25:50.288 --> 25:51.154
Come on.

25:52.257 --> 25:54.191
Come on. You're the tigress.

25:54.258 --> 25:56.993
Come on. Come on. Come on.

26:08.201 --> 26:10.535
Oh.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.870
Oh, yeah.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.139
Oh, Christian. Oh, that's so

26:15.207 --> 26:18.508
good. Oh.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.342
Oh!

26:19.410 --> 26:20.677
What are you doing?

26:20.745 --> 26:22.177
What?

26:22.245 --> 26:23.177
You don't come like that with

26:23.245 --> 26:24.575
me. That's...

26:24.643 --> 26:26.507
but I'm having an orgasm.

26:26.575 --> 26:28.509
You faked that.

26:28.576 --> 26:29.276
No, I did not.

26:29.343 --> 26:31.277
Yes, you did. Bullshit.

26:35.215 --> 26:36.982
Filthy old porn trash.

26:37.050 --> 26:38.984
Oh, thanks.

26:42.620 --> 26:45.488
I'm sorry. This is the only time

26:45.556 --> 26:46.756
I've done it, ok? I've never

26:46.824 --> 26:48.391
done it before. I promise.

26:48.459 --> 26:49.125
And why should I believe

26:49.193 --> 26:49.859
that, huh?

26:49.927 --> 26:50.660
I've never done that! Well,

26:50.728 --> 26:51.427
because I'm not really into

26:51.495 --> 26:52.195
the choking thing. It freaks

26:52.262 --> 26:52.962
me out.

26:53.030 --> 26:53.729
Well, why didn't you just

26:53.797 --> 26:54.496
tell me?

26:54.564 --> 26:55.264
Because I feel guilty.

26:55.332 --> 26:56.232
Guilty? What the hell for?

27:33.803 --> 27:35.003
I think that you have made

27:35.070 --> 27:37.371
the right decision.

27:37.439 --> 27:39.073
There's not much choice. It's

27:39.140 --> 27:43.811
peach or blueberry.

27:43.878 --> 27:45.880
I overheard Ryerson on his

27:45.947 --> 27:47.982
cell after you 2 worked on that

27:48.050 --> 27:50.919
girl the other day. You're going

27:50.986 --> 27:53.988
with him to Africa. I just want

27:54.056 --> 27:55.824
you to know, I think it's really

27:55.891 --> 27:58.226
great. I mean, I do hate you for

27:58.293 --> 28:01.729
leaving, but I do understand.

28:01.796 --> 28:02.729
And by the way, when the hell

28:02.797 --> 28:05.131
were you going to tell me?

28:05.199 --> 28:06.265
I mean, should I update my

28:06.333 --> 28:07.800
resume?

28:07.868 --> 28:09.802
It hasn't sunk in yet.

28:12.540 --> 28:15.174
What did Christian say?

28:15.242 --> 28:16.275
Haven't told him.

28:16.343 --> 28:17.309
Oh.

28:17.377 --> 28:18.143
Yet.

28:18.211 --> 28:20.045
Ah.

28:20.113 --> 28:23.382
Don't say anything, ok?

28:23.449 --> 28:25.750
You know, it's funny. After

28:25.818 --> 28:27.251
all these years of you changing

28:27.319 --> 28:30.022
people, and you being the one

28:30.089 --> 28:32.025
who needed it.

29:19.447 --> 29:20.981
Shithead was right. Feels

29:21.049 --> 29:23.018
like an orgasm everywhere... in my

29:23.085 --> 29:25.555
feet, shoulders. Oh, God. Going

29:25.622 --> 29:26.222
to come.

29:34.357 --> 29:38.454
Get up and take the belt off.

29:41.824 --> 29:43.891
Shit. I can't move. There's

29:43.959 --> 29:47.192
not enough... I can't feel...

29:47.260 --> 29:50.228
I can't breathe. Stand up and

29:50.296 --> 29:52.896
take the goddamn belt off. Get

29:52.964 --> 29:55.565
up. Get up!

30:10.055 --> 30:11.155
Christian?

30:15.559 --> 30:17.593
Christian?

30:17.660 --> 30:19.594
Jesus Christ

30:28.135 --> 30:30.069
Christian!

30:39.342 --> 30:40.342
No.

30:40.410 --> 30:43.443
Are you ok? Are you

30:43.510 --> 30:44.343
sure you don't want them to

30:44.411 --> 30:46.679
come? Did you try and kill

30:46.747 --> 30:49.815
yourself?

30:49.882 --> 30:51.449
What is it, the choking thing?

30:51.517 --> 30:52.917
Honey, if it is, I don't care.

30:52.984 --> 30:54.652
I'll do it. I'll do whatever you

30:54.719 --> 30:56.186
want. I'll be a slave, if you

30:56.254 --> 30:56.954
want.

30:57.071 --> 30:58.876
I don't want a slave.

30:58.943 --> 31:01.345
I didn't mean it like that.

31:01.412 --> 31:02.479
That's not what I meant.

31:02.547 --> 31:06.283
Yes, it is.

31:06.350 --> 31:09.352
I had this...

31:09.419 --> 31:11.654
Moment of clarity before I lost

31:11.721 --> 31:16.624
consciousness.

31:16.692 --> 31:20.360
You'll never make me happy.

31:20.428 --> 31:23.829
I...

31:23.897 --> 31:25.164
Can never love you enough.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.299
Oh, baby. You are not

31:27.367 --> 31:28.366
thinking clearly. You don't have

31:28.434 --> 31:29.500
enough oxygen in your brain. You

31:29.567 --> 31:31.066
don't know what you're saying.

31:31.134 --> 31:33.600
I've never felt so clear.

31:33.668 --> 31:35.501
Christian, we've hit a rough

31:35.569 --> 31:36.769
patch. You don't break up

31:36.836 --> 31:39.037
because of it. We said "for

31:39.104 --> 31:41.138
better or worse," remember?

31:41.206 --> 31:45.441
Yeah.

31:45.509 --> 31:46.878
I can't that part.

31:46.945 --> 31:48.747
Ok, look. This is my fault.

31:48.815 --> 31:50.616
It's my fault. I've been a bad

31:50.683 --> 31:53.151
wife, and I've done really bad

31:53.218 --> 31:55.418
things. But I'm so sorry, and

31:55.486 --> 31:57.320
I'll make it up to you. And i

31:57.387 --> 31:59.822
know that you'll love me again.

32:02.959 --> 32:03.925
Can you hear what you're

32:03.993 --> 32:06.796
saying?

32:10.335 --> 32:14.439
I'm not good for you.

32:14.507 --> 32:16.442
I'm meant to be alone.

32:51.283 --> 32:53.884
He kicked me out.

32:56.388 --> 32:58.423
That's it. It's over. He's done

32:58.491 --> 32:59.624
with me now.

32:59.692 --> 33:04.129
You've heard that before...

33:04.196 --> 33:05.964
How many hundreds of times?

33:06.032 --> 33:07.600
No, it's different

33:07.667 --> 33:10.803
this time.

33:10.871 --> 33:12.105
You should have seen the look on

33:12.172 --> 33:16.843
his face.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.779
We're like 2 strangers. I mean,

33:18.847 --> 33:21.115
the guy doesn't even like me.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.121
Good.

33:27.189 --> 33:29.724
He's doing you a favor, Kimber.

33:29.792 --> 33:33.394
It's a gift.

33:33.462 --> 33:34.696
But I don't want that kind of

33:34.764 --> 33:37.000
gift. I want one that includes

33:37.067 --> 33:41.604
him, one for us. I mean, he's

33:41.672 --> 33:43.305
where I belong.

33:43.373 --> 33:45.209
Not anymore. Maybe you never

33:45.277 --> 33:48.376
did, right? Maybe it was just

33:48.443 --> 33:49.775
your fear of not belonging

33:49.843 --> 33:52.411
anywhere that made you so stuck.

33:52.478 --> 33:54.644
Doesn't matter now. All that

33:54.712 --> 33:55.677
matters now is, what are you

33:55.745 --> 33:59.147
going to do? This is your

33:59.215 --> 34:02.312
opportunity, Kimber. Jump. Take

34:02.380 --> 34:04.681
the leap. Find out who you are

34:04.748 --> 34:05.615
without him telling you you're

34:05.682 --> 34:08.014
not good enough, pretty enough,

34:08.081 --> 34:10.812
smart enough. Do it before you

34:10.880 --> 34:12.847
get too old and you can't.

34:17.052 --> 34:18.484
I'm not like you, Sean.

34:18.552 --> 34:22.150
I don't hate Christian.

34:22.219 --> 34:25.252
And I certainly don't want to be

34:25.320 --> 34:27.253
him, either.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.442
Hey.

34:52.509 --> 34:54.377
Hey.

34:54.445 --> 34:55.777
What's the with bad mood?

34:55.846 --> 34:58.214
Well, I don't really

34:58.282 --> 34:59.648
enjoy hanging out with a bunch

34:59.716 --> 35:01.917
of Hollywood skanks.

35:01.984 --> 35:03.585
Oh, come on. They're nice

35:03.652 --> 35:05.087
girls, Kimber.

35:05.154 --> 35:06.121
You said we were going to be

35:06.189 --> 35:07.489
alone.

35:07.557 --> 35:08.891
You'll get your turn. There's

35:08.959 --> 35:10.359
more than enough Mike to go

35:10.427 --> 35:12.394
around.

35:15.998 --> 35:17.265
Ok. Just give me a second. I'll

35:17.333 --> 35:21.168
be right there. I believe April

35:21.235 --> 35:23.170
is next. Excuse me.

35:23.237 --> 35:24.337
I thought I was the one you

35:24.405 --> 35:25.605
wanted to spend the rest of your

35:25.672 --> 35:28.074
life with.

35:28.142 --> 35:31.346
So did I.

35:31.413 --> 35:36.318
Wow. Crazy times, huh?

35:36.386 --> 35:37.452
I'll tell you what. It's a good

35:37.520 --> 35:38.687
thing you kicked my ass to

35:38.755 --> 35:41.289
the curb that final time. I

35:41.357 --> 35:43.025
mean, it's taken a shitload of

35:43.092 --> 35:45.126
curbs, but I think I finally got

35:45.194 --> 35:45.960
the message.

35:46.028 --> 35:47.228
I'm sorry about that. It was

35:47.296 --> 35:48.597
shitty.

35:49.398 --> 35:52.200
And I don't have an excuse

35:52.268 --> 35:54.936
other than I was obsessed with

35:55.004 --> 35:56.437
Christian. But I don't feel that

35:56.505 --> 35:58.606
way. And you're so good to me,

35:58.673 --> 36:00.073
and we're good together, and I

36:00.141 --> 36:02.176
just... I really, in my heart,

36:02.244 --> 36:03.345
feel that 2 people that are

36:03.412 --> 36:04.846
right for each other need to

36:04.914 --> 36:06.014
spend the rest of their lives

36:06.082 --> 36:07.082
together.

36:07.149 --> 36:08.082
Honey, , I've got more bumps

36:08.150 --> 36:11.018
and bruises than a rodeo clown.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.320
I can handle the pain, but after

36:13.388 --> 36:15.121
a while, you just get tired of

36:15.189 --> 36:18.558
being laughed at.

36:18.625 --> 36:22.060
Listen... do me a favor,

36:22.128 --> 36:25.263
will you, Kimber?

36:25.331 --> 36:26.664
I've got a Chateau Mouton

36:26.732 --> 36:29.432
Rothschild 1986 over at the bar.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.300
Why don't you be a sweetie and

36:30.368 --> 36:31.734
go get it?

36:33.604 --> 36:36.372
And bring a corkscrew.

36:44.346 --> 36:47.647
Hey. Kimber?

36:47.715 --> 36:50.216
The wine?

36:52.285 --> 36:54.185
Finally got

36:54.253 --> 36:54.586
the message.

36:54.654 --> 36:55.320
I'm sorry about that. It was

36:55.387 --> 36:55.653
shitty.

36:56.288 --> 36:56.921
And I don't have an excuse

36:56.989 --> 36:57.622
other than I was obsessed with

36:57.689 --> 36:58.355
Christian. But I don't feel that

36:58.423 --> 36:59.056
way. And you're so good to me,

36:59.124 --> 36:59.757
and we're good together, and I

36:59.824 --> 37:00.424
just... I really, in my heart,

37:00.492 --> 37:01.091
feel that 2 people that are

37:01.159 --> 37:01.758
right for each other need to

37:01.826 --> 37:02.392
spend the rest of their life together.

37:03.294 --> 37:03.560
Hey there.

37:03.627 --> 37:03.927
The wine?

38:10.436 --> 38:12.171
Not yet. I plan to take him

38:12.238 --> 38:14.840
to his favorite strip club and

38:14.908 --> 38:16.207
drop the bomb there, let naked

38:16.275 --> 38:19.947
women soften the blow.

38:20.015 --> 38:22.550
Uh, no. Not anymore. He kicked

38:22.618 --> 38:25.187
his wife out. Listen, Curtis,

38:25.255 --> 38:26.455
I was thinking we could author

38:26.523 --> 38:27.823
an article together based on

38:27.891 --> 38:30.726
this trip. I have an idea for

38:30.794 --> 38:32.594
a new procedure on patients with

38:32.662 --> 38:36.664
neurofibromatosis.

38:36.732 --> 38:40.967
Great. Ok. Yeah.

38:41.035 --> 38:42.369
Well, we'll talk about it when I

38:42.436 --> 38:45.472
see you in a few days.

38:45.539 --> 38:48.240
Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye.

38:49.576 --> 38:51.510
What?

39:07.123 --> 39:08.557
Kimber fell off a boat last

39:08.625 --> 39:12.227
night. She's, uh...

39:12.294 --> 39:13.528
She's missing.

39:13.596 --> 39:16.064
What? Whose boat?

39:16.132 --> 39:16.531
See you in a few days.

39:16.599 --> 39:17.165
Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye.

39:17.566 --> 39:17.832
What?

39:18.868 --> 39:19.467
Kimber fell off a boat last

39:19.535 --> 39:20.001
night. She's, uh...

39:22.071 --> 39:24.105
coast guard thinks she, uh...

39:24.173 --> 39:27.409
thinks she's dead.

39:27.476 --> 39:29.177
Wait. I... I don't understand

39:29.245 --> 39:31.946
what happened. She...

39:32.014 --> 39:33.281
She slipped and fell off

39:33.349 --> 39:34.249
the boat?

39:34.316 --> 39:36.451
I think she jumped.

39:36.518 --> 39:37.619
Jumped?

39:37.686 --> 39:40.388
Yeah.

39:40.456 --> 39:43.958
Suicide?

39:44.026 --> 39:45.226
Well, but the coast guard is

39:45.294 --> 39:46.194
still searching, so they could

39:46.261 --> 39:48.829
still find her.

39:48.897 --> 39:53.768
Impossible. 12 hours?

39:53.835 --> 39:55.202
Can't survive in the water that

39:55.270 --> 39:57.204
long, you know.

40:01.710 --> 40:04.078
I kicked her out last

40:04.145 --> 40:07.347
night. I told her I wanted her

40:07.415 --> 40:09.349
out of my life.

40:15.523 --> 40:17.657
I shouldn't have...

40:17.725 --> 40:20.493
I should have...

40:27.067 --> 40:29.002
I don't know what to do.

40:52.025 --> 40:53.225
There you are. Hey,

40:53.293 --> 40:56.529
Dr. Mcnamara, I wanted to thank

40:56.596 --> 40:57.496
you and Dr. Troy for

40:57.564 --> 40:58.497
the excellent care I've received

40:58.565 --> 41:00.933
here.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.134
Is he around?

41:02.202 --> 41:06.539
No. He's... uh...

41:06.607 --> 41:07.840
You look like you're healing

41:07.908 --> 41:10.476
well, Mr. Seabrook.

41:10.544 --> 41:13.346
I feel great. Today really is

41:13.413 --> 41:14.280
the first day of the rest of my

41:14.348 --> 41:16.182
life, and I'm not going to let

41:16.249 --> 41:17.383
another day pass doing things i

41:17.450 --> 41:18.550
don't want to do or feeling ways

41:18.618 --> 41:20.519
I don't want to feel.

41:20.587 --> 41:24.890
Good for you.

41:24.958 --> 41:27.693
I wish you luck with everything.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.760
Hope the same for you,

41:28.828 --> 41:31.997
Dr. Mcnamara.

41:32.065 --> 41:33.999
Goodbye.
