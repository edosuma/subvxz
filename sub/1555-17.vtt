00:01.413 --> 00:04.080
We are being watched.

00:04.082 --> 00:06.215
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.217 --> 00:10.520
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.522 --> 00:13.189
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.191 --> 00:15.024
but it sees everything...

00:15.026 --> 00:18.428
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.430 --> 00:21.431
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.433
We don't.

00:23.435 --> 00:28.037
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.039 --> 00:29.872
You will never find us.

00:29.874 --> 00:32.040
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.043 --> 00:34.977
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:39.015 --> 00:41.249
The engineers that Corwin had
reassembled the machine.

00:41.251 --> 00:43.218
After we shipped it off,
there have been accidents,

00:43.220 --> 00:44.687
disappearances.

00:44.689 --> 00:46.555
I think the government
may be killing them.

00:46.557 --> 00:49.091
Alicia isn't going to have me
bumped off.

00:49.093 --> 00:50.793
I knew you would come,
my friends.

00:52.362 --> 00:54.196
The victims of the ferry bombing

00:54.198 --> 00:57.032
include Nathan Ingram,
founder and CEO of IFT Inc.,

00:57.034 --> 01:00.002
- one of the world's...
- Did you know?

01:56.158 --> 01:57.157
Hello?

01:57.159 --> 01:58.991
Alicia Corwin...

01:58.993 --> 02:00.693
...you are a murderer and a traitor.

02:00.695 --> 02:02.095
Who is this?

02:02.097 --> 02:03.363
The actions of you
and your associates

02:03.365 --> 02:05.065
have not gone unnoticed.

02:05.067 --> 02:08.334
Because of you,
Nathan Ingram is dead.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.671
Consider this a warning.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.283
Code 703412.

02:24.285 --> 02:26.251
Office of Special Counsel,
please.

02:26.253 --> 02:29.021
I'm sorry,
Special Counsel is unavailable.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.490
No, you get him on the phone
right now!

02:31.492 --> 02:35.094
I have just been threatened.
Someone knows.

02:35.096 --> 02:36.761
We'll look into it.

02:44.413 --> 02:45.690
_

02:48.330 --> 02:50.449
_

02:52.233 --> 02:54.114
_

03:10.662 --> 03:13.564
He was my best friend, and...

03:13.566 --> 03:18.902
in an instant,
he was simply... gone.

03:22.506 --> 03:27.044
I've struggled with my injury
every day since then.

03:27.046 --> 03:30.647
I fear I may never regain
the use of my arm.

03:33.718 --> 03:37.621
I'm sorry, Dr. Edwards,
this was probably a bad idea.

03:37.623 --> 03:39.222
It's okay, Harold,
you don't have to say

03:39.224 --> 03:41.625
anything more
than you're comfortable with.

03:41.627 --> 03:46.896
But... you know the way you talk
about your accident,

03:46.898 --> 03:51.434
the loss of your friend,
the pain, it seems as though

03:51.436 --> 03:54.904
you've carried this grief
for some time.

03:54.906 --> 03:58.040
Everyone grieves
in different ways.

03:58.042 --> 04:01.210
Hey, glasses, tell
him about all your nut ball friends.

04:01.212 --> 04:03.980
Maybe he can give you guys
a group therapy discount.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.882
I think by now, you count

04:05.884 --> 04:08.717
as one of Harold's
nut ball friends, Lionel.

04:08.719 --> 04:11.487
With you people,
there's no other kind.

04:11.489 --> 04:13.088
Shane Edwards.

04:13.090 --> 04:15.391
Guy's a shrink for victims
of violent crimes.

04:15.393 --> 04:18.026
Big time psychiatrist
once upon a time.

04:18.028 --> 04:19.595
Then he lost his wife.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.096
Eight years ago, Lucy Edwards.

04:21.098 --> 04:22.096
She was murdered
in their apartment

04:22.099 --> 04:23.832
by a psycho delivery guy.

04:23.834 --> 04:26.034
Shane founded his non-profit
soon after.

04:26.036 --> 04:27.735
You live alone?

04:27.737 --> 04:29.737
No.
Well, yes, technically.

04:29.739 --> 04:31.539
I have a dog.

04:31.541 --> 04:33.574
Is the dog from your wife?

04:33.576 --> 04:35.877
No, we never--

04:35.879 --> 04:39.915
My fiancee didn't have any pets.
How do you know--

04:39.917 --> 04:43.050
That there was someone else
in your life?

04:43.052 --> 04:45.687
Just a hunch.

04:45.689 --> 04:50.891
We broke it off, and...

04:50.893 --> 04:53.194
that's really all I have to say
about that.

04:53.196 --> 04:57.365
I understand, but I want you
to know I've been in that seat.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.499
I'm no stranger to what
you're feeling.

05:02.804 --> 05:04.738
Why don't we call it,
talk more next time.

05:04.740 --> 05:06.140
Sound good?

05:10.745 --> 05:12.579
Is that your wife?

05:12.581 --> 05:17.083
Yeah.
Yeah, that's Lucy.

05:17.085 --> 05:20.220
Like I said,
I've been there before.

05:20.222 --> 05:21.921
She died eight years ago.

05:21.923 --> 05:25.826
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry,
Dr. Edwards.

05:25.828 --> 05:29.062
You know, even when
your world stops,

05:29.064 --> 05:31.498
the world around you
keeps moving forward,

05:31.500 --> 05:33.432
and you will too.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.102
Take care, Harold.

05:36.104 --> 05:37.337
Thanks.

05:39.806 --> 05:44.677
I still have dreams sometimes
where I'm walking...

05:44.679 --> 05:46.179
and then I wake up.

05:46.181 --> 05:47.646
How does that make you feel?

05:47.648 --> 05:51.584
Trapped, helpless.
Every morning, that first moment

05:51.586 --> 05:55.020
when I wake up and I realize
I can't feel my legs,

05:55.022 --> 05:57.590
I'm forced to relive it.

05:57.592 --> 06:00.192
Seeing Barton behind the wheel,
high off his ass,

06:00.194 --> 06:02.428
and then he hits me.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.830
His lawyers must have gotten him
out of rehab early,

06:04.832 --> 06:07.532
because I saw a picture of him
partying the other day.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.368
He's posting
all these stupid status updates,

06:09.370 --> 06:11.503
promoting his new club.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.472
It's not fair
that he does this to me,

06:14.474 --> 06:16.474
and he gets to go out
and live his life.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.010
Can I punch this guy
in the face?

06:18.012 --> 06:19.511
Get in line.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.380
You have every reason
to be angry, Angela,

06:21.382 --> 06:25.517
but you have to let it go.
You can't change the past.

06:25.519 --> 06:29.086
And people like that,
they don't walk free forever.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.691
Karma has a way
of finding them.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.027
Edwards' job involved
dredging up a lot of details

06:36.029 --> 06:37.629
about violent crimes.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.631
Maybe he dug up something
he wasn't supposed to.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.067
You got this one, Lionel.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.137
I got a therapy session
of my own to get to.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.239
Yeah, give Red my regards.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.545
There seems to be
a little bit of darkness

06:54.547 --> 06:56.647
about you today, Detective.

07:01.753 --> 07:05.689
I met a guy this morning
who lost someone.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.190
Changed his life.

07:09.527 --> 07:12.829
Just brings up bad memories.

07:12.831 --> 07:16.699
And how do you handle loss?

07:16.701 --> 07:20.203
You don't want to go there.

07:20.205 --> 07:22.839
You're retreating inward
again, John.

07:24.875 --> 07:28.344
What was that you said
about new habits?

07:28.346 --> 07:32.815
Developing new habits
isn't as easy as it sounds.

07:39.323 --> 07:41.891
How was your session
with Dr. Campbell?

07:41.893 --> 07:44.593
Doctor/patient confidentiality,
Finch.

07:44.595 --> 07:47.529
Fair enough.

07:49.465 --> 07:51.400
Any luck with Edward's
apartment?

07:51.402 --> 07:55.504
I must say,
I'm getting rather good...

07:55.506 --> 07:58.440
at this breaking and entering
business.

08:01.310 --> 08:04.779
Although I don't quite
understand

08:04.781 --> 08:07.082
the purpose of the carnitas.

08:07.084 --> 08:08.616
Ah, it's just an old spy trick

08:08.618 --> 08:10.518
for neutralizing
security systems.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.087
Security system?

08:12.089 --> 08:13.788
- Knock knock.
- Oh, hey, Becca.

08:13.790 --> 08:15.990
We got some of your mail again.

08:15.992 --> 08:19.327
Someone should probably
say something to the mailman.

08:19.329 --> 08:22.162
He gets confused
'cause we look so much alike.

08:22.164 --> 08:23.864
Good point.

08:23.866 --> 08:25.633
Where's Hector today?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.301
He only does Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

08:38.547 --> 08:40.214
Hector.

08:42.984 --> 08:45.585
It's very funny,
Mr. Reese.

08:50.491 --> 08:52.525
My coworkers and I
are gonna go check out

08:52.527 --> 08:55.495
that new bar up the street,
and I-- we were wondering

08:55.497 --> 08:57.530
if maybe you'd like
to come along.

08:57.532 --> 09:00.867
Thanks, but I-I got
a prior commitment.

09:00.869 --> 09:02.969
Oh, yeah, of course, sure.
No problem.

09:02.971 --> 09:06.172
Figured I'd just ask.

09:06.174 --> 09:07.874
Say hi to Hector for me.

09:07.876 --> 09:10.409
Will do.

09:10.411 --> 09:12.879
All right, Finch,
Edwards is headed for the gym.

09:12.881 --> 09:14.647
Find anything in his apartment?

09:14.649 --> 09:16.883
Edwards' wife's belongings
are everywhere.

09:16.885 --> 09:19.718
But she died eight years ago.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.156
Perhaps he hasn't taken
his own advice about moving on.

09:40.039 --> 09:42.774
Finch, I think we may have
a problem.

09:42.776 --> 09:46.077
Edwards just planted a gun
in someone's gym locker.

09:46.079 --> 09:48.479
And now he's leaving the gym
without working out.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.285
Okay, he just went into a bank.

10:02.528 --> 10:06.230
Edwards is following
a very deliberate schedule,

10:06.232 --> 10:07.998
setting up pieces.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.500
You think he's going to rob
the bank?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.044
He's making his move, Finch.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.651
Or not.

10:30.788 --> 10:32.556
Something else is going on.

10:36.227 --> 10:38.395
He's using a code to go in
through the service entrance.

10:38.397 --> 10:40.163
Might be messing
with the electrical system,

10:40.165 --> 10:41.565
security cams.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.507
What's he doing now?

10:53.244 --> 10:55.311
He's making a call
from a burner phone.

10:55.313 --> 10:56.512
Clyde Barton.

10:56.514 --> 10:57.613
Hi, is this the account holder

10:57.615 --> 10:58.848
at After Hours Management?

10:58.850 --> 11:00.416
Yeah.

11:00.418 --> 11:03.352
This is Brian Humphries
at Fisher Savings & Loan.

11:03.354 --> 11:05.788
It appears the government's made
an inquiry into your account

11:05.790 --> 11:06.922
and decided to freeze it.

11:06.924 --> 11:08.257
Are you kidding me?

11:08.259 --> 11:09.825
My accountant said
everything was in order!

11:09.827 --> 11:11.159
Sir, there's no need
to raise your voice.

11:11.161 --> 11:12.828
This is a pretty standard
procedure.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.162
If you'll just come
down to our branch on Montague,

11:14.164 --> 11:16.198
we can get all this
straightened out.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.267
You bet your ass we will.
I'll be right there!

11:18.269 --> 11:20.535
Finch, you got a line
on After Hours Management?

11:20.537 --> 11:25.173
When it comes to breaking,
entering, and hacking,

11:25.175 --> 11:28.043
I can only do two at a time.

11:28.045 --> 11:30.279
Finch, that guy Edwards
was talking to--

11:30.281 --> 11:32.447
Clyde Barton?
That club owner

11:32.449 --> 11:34.349
who put Edwards' patient
in a wheelchair.

11:34.351 --> 11:35.483
How'd you know?

11:35.485 --> 11:36.851
Edwards seems to have done

11:36.853 --> 11:40.221
extensive research
on Clyde Barton,

11:40.223 --> 11:43.691
and he's been researching
this bank for weeks.

11:45.061 --> 11:46.828
Hello?
Fisher Savings.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.229
Hi, is this Brian Humphries?

11:48.231 --> 11:49.997
- Yeah.
- Listen carefully.

11:49.999 --> 11:52.900
My associate is
about to rob your bank.

11:52.902 --> 11:54.335
Now, if you cooperate fully

11:54.337 --> 11:55.836
without alerting
the authorities,

11:55.838 --> 11:58.005
no one will get hurt,
including you.

11:58.007 --> 12:00.541
My friend's a big guy
wearing sweats.

12:00.543 --> 12:01.976
When he comes in,
he'll look for you.

12:01.978 --> 12:04.412
Give him your keys
and your keycard.

12:04.414 --> 12:05.980
Don't do anything stupid.

12:05.982 --> 12:08.082
Okay, Finch,
this makes no sense.

12:08.084 --> 12:09.349
I'm going in.

12:11.085 --> 12:13.186
I need to see
Brian Humphries now.

12:13.188 --> 12:14.755
Do you see my friend?

12:14.757 --> 12:16.323
Yeah.

12:16.325 --> 12:20.561
Please remain calm.
I'll get you what you need.

12:20.563 --> 12:22.095
What are you talking about?

12:22.097 --> 12:23.630
We don't want any trouble.

12:28.837 --> 12:30.036
Help!

12:33.175 --> 12:34.841
Help!
This guy's trying to rob us!

12:34.843 --> 12:35.875
- Stop right there!
- What? I'm not trying to--

12:38.879 --> 12:40.013
Get out of here!

12:40.015 --> 12:41.448
This guy's got a gun!

12:41.450 --> 12:42.782
Get your face on the ground!

12:44.417 --> 12:47.520
You're not gonna
believe this, Finch.

12:47.522 --> 12:49.522
Edwards just framed this guy
for armed robbery.

12:49.524 --> 12:51.891
That's not all.

12:51.893 --> 12:54.927
It doesn't appear
that this is the first time

12:54.929 --> 12:56.963
Edwards has framed
someone like this.

12:56.965 --> 13:00.466
I believe our new number may be
something of a vigilante.

13:02.303 --> 13:05.004
Then who's his next target?

13:16.175 --> 13:18.776
So Edwards is a vigilante, huh?

13:18.778 --> 13:21.912
He's put a total of
seven people in prison,

13:21.914 --> 13:26.917
all of them aggressors
who had harmed his patients.

13:26.919 --> 13:28.585
How far back do these frames
go, Finch?

13:28.587 --> 13:33.089
Back to when he started
his victim advocacy non-profit

13:33.091 --> 13:37.093
in honor of his wife, Lucy.

13:37.095 --> 13:41.331
Her killer, Wyatt Morris,
a delivery man

13:41.333 --> 13:43.032
who got a little bit
too friendly with Lucy

13:43.034 --> 13:45.468
while making deliveries,
and made her uncomfortable.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.870
She was concerned that he
might be unstable,

13:47.872 --> 13:50.840
so they filed a complaint
with his employer.

13:50.842 --> 13:54.944
The day before the murder,
Morris attempted a delivery

13:54.946 --> 13:57.513
at the house, but Lucy
didn't answer the door.

13:57.515 --> 13:59.515
He returned the following day.

13:59.517 --> 14:01.650
She came to the door
and signed for the package.

14:01.652 --> 14:04.120
That evening, according
to Edwards' testimony,

14:04.122 --> 14:07.723
he saw Morris leaving
as he arrived home from work.

14:07.725 --> 14:11.660
Moments later, he discovered
his wife, bludgeoned to death.

14:11.662 --> 14:13.395
Where is Morris now?

14:13.397 --> 14:16.298
In prison, serving 15 years
for manslaughter.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.501
Manslaughter?
Why not murder?

14:19.503 --> 14:21.069
Because all of the evidence
was circumstantial.

14:21.071 --> 14:23.171
There was no witness
to the actual murder.

14:23.173 --> 14:24.806
Otherwise, he'd be serving
a life sentence.

14:24.808 --> 14:27.475
Edwards is punishing people
who deserve it,

14:27.477 --> 14:32.848
and making sure no innocent
people get hurt in the process.

14:32.850 --> 14:35.884
You should hire him, Finch,
take the week off.

14:35.886 --> 14:38.586
Need I remind you, Mr. Reese,
that his number has come up,

14:38.588 --> 14:41.021
which means that
his next target

14:41.023 --> 14:44.024
may escalate
beyond any simple crime.

14:44.026 --> 14:47.995
Or one of his previous targets
is coming back for revenge.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.233
How you doing, boy?

14:52.235 --> 14:54.635
It appears Edwards is
arriving home now.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.711
He's putting tape on his tuxedo.

15:04.713 --> 15:07.348
Either he doesn't trust
Hugo Boss lapels

15:07.350 --> 15:10.017
to stay in place,
or he's planning

15:10.019 --> 15:12.719
to start his next frame
at tonight's gala.

15:12.721 --> 15:16.390
Edwards is making a presentation
tonight about his non-profit.

15:16.392 --> 15:18.725
It appears to be
an elite crowd.

15:18.727 --> 15:21.928
Admission will require
a rather large donation

15:21.930 --> 15:24.130
from our already depleted funds.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.566
Save your money, Professor.

15:26.568 --> 15:28.201
Might have an easier way
to get in.

15:35.409 --> 15:37.610
Thanks for getting me in, doc.

15:37.612 --> 15:40.213
You're the one
doing me a favor.

15:40.215 --> 15:42.782
The NYPD has a table
at this gala every year.

15:42.784 --> 15:44.784
I'm always looking
for people willing

15:44.786 --> 15:46.652
to come represent the precinct.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.087
Thank you.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.558
I think the tuxes
keep them away.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.463
It's good to see your
empathetic side, John.

15:57.465 --> 15:58.931
It shows real progress.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.633
I'm glad I could join you.

16:00.635 --> 16:05.404
Um, you look... stunning,
by the way.

16:05.406 --> 16:09.141
And it's good to see
this other side of you too.

16:09.143 --> 16:12.444
I feel like a waiter
in this thing.

16:12.446 --> 16:13.778
You know, I don't think
I've worn a cummerbund

16:13.780 --> 16:15.513
since senior prom.

16:15.515 --> 16:18.683
You're welcome, Detective.
Where is Edwards now?

16:18.685 --> 16:22.186
Don't worry,
Finch, we got eyes on him.

16:22.188 --> 16:25.323
Hi, everyone.
Thank you all for coming.

16:25.325 --> 16:27.124
I hope you're all
at least getting a drink

16:27.126 --> 16:28.993
out of your tax write-offs
tonight.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.930
For those of you
who don't know who I am,

16:31.932 --> 16:34.265
my name's Shane Edwards.

16:34.267 --> 16:37.969
And this is my wife, Lucy.

16:37.971 --> 16:42.206
Lucy was a photographer.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.175
We met in a garden--

16:44.177 --> 16:46.877
quiet little spot
with a fountain--

16:46.879 --> 16:49.546
when I absentmindedly traipsed

16:49.548 --> 16:52.182
through her
perfectly timed shot,

16:52.184 --> 16:54.284
ruining hours of prep work,

16:54.286 --> 16:58.789
but instead of getting mad,
she just started laughing.

16:58.791 --> 17:01.358
Said there was no use
getting upset now.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.294
She'd just have to make do
with an avant-garde,

17:04.296 --> 17:06.530
golden hour photo
of a blurry foot.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.000
Mr. Reese, we
may have some trouble.

17:10.002 --> 17:12.068
Someone's sneaking in
through the service entrance.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.669
Oh, my, it's Morris,

17:13.671 --> 17:16.306
the man convicted of
killing Edwards' wife.

17:16.308 --> 17:17.973
I thought he was in prison.

17:17.976 --> 17:19.976
Released yesterday on parole.

17:19.978 --> 17:23.346
The system wasn't updated
due to an administrative delay.

17:23.348 --> 17:25.247
But what the hell
is he doing here?

17:25.249 --> 17:27.415
And a couple of years
later, I proposed to her,

17:27.417 --> 17:29.151
right there in the garden,

17:29.153 --> 17:32.722
just after we'd carved
our initials on a bench nearby.

17:32.724 --> 17:35.825
After her passing...

17:35.827 --> 17:39.094
I couldn't bring myself
to visit that place anymore.

17:39.096 --> 17:43.032
I couldn't even think about it
until I went into therapy.

17:43.034 --> 17:46.902
And it was therapy
that made me whole again.

17:46.904 --> 17:49.338
Moving on is not about
forgetting or ignoring...

17:49.340 --> 17:51.540
Morris is heading
straight for Edwards.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.042
Excuse me for a moment.

17:54.777 --> 17:57.245
So, doc, I keep
having this dream.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.847
Hmm.

17:58.849 --> 18:01.850
And that's why victim advocacy
is so important,

18:01.852 --> 18:04.019
no matter what form
that advocacy takes.

18:04.021 --> 18:05.787
So I'm here tonight
to ask you to help me

18:05.789 --> 18:09.257
continue in my practice.
Thank you very much.

18:14.396 --> 18:16.297
Thanks for coming.

18:16.299 --> 18:18.899
Been a while, doc.

18:18.901 --> 18:20.935
You? What the hell
are you doing here?

18:22.038 --> 18:23.804
For seven years--

18:23.806 --> 18:24.939
What are they saying, Finch?

18:24.941 --> 18:25.940
Too much commotion.

18:25.942 --> 18:28.309
Seven years of my life.

18:28.311 --> 18:29.877
Mr. Reese,
what's happening?

18:29.879 --> 18:31.579
I think Morris
just threatened Edwards.

18:32.949 --> 18:34.414
Seven years!

18:37.251 --> 18:39.152
Edwards is on the move, Finch.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.060
Something's wrong, Finch.
The battery in Edwards' car

18:46.062 --> 18:47.394
has been drained.
It's wired to blow!

18:47.396 --> 18:48.295
Get down!

18:56.105 --> 18:59.072
All right, doc,
why does Morris want you dead?

19:25.542 --> 19:27.569
_

19:29.636 --> 19:30.869
Hello?

20:45.876 --> 20:48.011
It's you, isn't it?

20:50.081 --> 20:52.616
I suppose you're trying
to tell me not to do this.

20:54.819 --> 20:58.588
But I haven't given you
a voice...

20:58.590 --> 21:00.523
so you have nothing to say.

21:28.952 --> 21:30.553
Any news on Morris?

21:30.555 --> 21:32.955
Our guys are still
looking for him.

21:32.957 --> 21:35.991
Have you had any contact
with Morris since the trial?

21:35.993 --> 21:37.893
No.

21:37.895 --> 21:39.928
I heard he was
getting out of prison soon.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.397
I never imagined he'd
come after me.

21:42.399 --> 21:43.798
You think he tried to kill you

21:43.800 --> 21:45.167
'cause your testimony
put him away?

21:45.169 --> 21:47.870
Killing my wife
is what put him away.

21:49.672 --> 21:52.440
I'm sorry,
I'm a little on edge.

21:52.442 --> 21:54.276
Last time I was
in a room like this

21:54.278 --> 21:56.811
was the night she died.

21:56.813 --> 21:58.680
Worst night of my life.

22:01.817 --> 22:05.754
It was snowing...
that kind of relentless snow

22:05.756 --> 22:09.824
where you forget there was
ever a world without it.

22:09.826 --> 22:12.059
I remember calling my wife
on the way home.

22:12.061 --> 22:13.427
She didn't answer.

22:13.429 --> 22:15.696
She was always bad
about answering the phone.

22:15.698 --> 22:17.198
I saw this delivery truck

22:17.200 --> 22:20.001
double parked
outside our building.

22:20.003 --> 22:21.302
Just as I was going in,

22:21.304 --> 22:23.837
the engine revved
and the truck took off.

22:23.839 --> 22:27.108
When I got up to our floor,

22:27.110 --> 22:30.511
the door was hanging open...

22:30.513 --> 22:34.882
and I ran inside, and...

22:34.884 --> 22:37.017
saw this package
lying on the floor,

22:37.019 --> 22:41.955
this small, brown package
wrapped in tape, lying in a--

22:44.125 --> 22:46.259
in a pool--

22:49.696 --> 22:51.564
When they found Morris,
he denied

22:51.566 --> 22:54.567
he had anything to do
with Lucy's death.

22:59.907 --> 23:02.542
You need anything else from me?

23:02.544 --> 23:05.243
I got an appointment starting
in about four hours,

23:05.245 --> 23:06.478
like to get
a bit of shut-eye.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.012
Morris is still out there
somewhere.

23:08.014 --> 23:09.481
This guy's taken
years of my life.

23:09.483 --> 23:11.650
He's not getting
any more of my time.

23:11.652 --> 23:14.619
We'll find him.

23:16.489 --> 23:19.524
Why would Morris, a
guy who was just paroled,

23:19.526 --> 23:22.760
put a bomb in Edwards' car
and risk everything

23:22.762 --> 23:24.728
by confronting him
in front of a crowd?

23:24.730 --> 23:26.164
Criminals do stupid,
incriminating stuff

23:26.166 --> 23:27.898
all the time.
You don't put a bomb

23:27.900 --> 23:30.001
in a guy's car because
you're mentally stable.

23:30.003 --> 23:32.337
Look,
before delivering packages,

23:32.339 --> 23:33.838
Morris worked construction.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.106
Demolitions.

23:35.108 --> 23:37.208
Guy knows how to build a bomb.

23:37.210 --> 23:39.009
Perhaps I can add
some pertinent information.

23:39.011 --> 23:41.378
I've just spotted new activity
on an old email account

23:41.380 --> 23:43.413
that Morris had
before he went to prison.

23:43.415 --> 23:46.784
A cryptic exchange
with an anonymized account,

23:46.786 --> 23:50.287
it says, "Roscoe has agreed
to meet in the can.

23:50.289 --> 23:54.724
11:00 AM tomorrow, Kent Avenue
and North Ninth Street."

23:54.726 --> 23:58.028
So Morris is about to meet
with a man named Roscoe?

23:58.030 --> 24:00.197
"Roscoe" is an old nickname
for a handgun.

24:00.199 --> 24:02.599
Morris is trying to
acquire a weapon.

24:02.601 --> 24:04.234
I'll head to the address.

24:04.236 --> 24:06.136
I'd like to have
a word with him.

24:11.208 --> 24:14.076
Hey, glasses, I just
heard back from the bomb squad.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.612
What have you got, Detective?

24:15.614 --> 24:18.481
Real amateur hour.
Another inch to the left

24:18.483 --> 24:19.916
and the igniter would have
been too far from the gas tank

24:19.918 --> 24:21.350
to set it off.

24:21.352 --> 24:23.219
Guy like Morris
with experience in explosives

24:23.221 --> 24:24.587
should have known better.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.956
Interesting.
Thank you, Detective.

24:27.958 --> 24:30.059
Any luck finding Roscoe?

24:30.061 --> 24:32.261
Well, the gun was already here.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.730
No sign of Morris yet.
And "In the can" meant

24:34.732 --> 24:36.665
in the trash
outside a public restroom.

24:36.667 --> 24:40.069
Hmm. Remind me to never
illegally purchase a firearm.

24:40.071 --> 24:43.139
While you're waiting,
here's something rather odd.

24:43.141 --> 24:44.740
Do you remember
when Edwards told you

24:44.742 --> 24:48.176
about seeing Morris's truck
the night his wife died?

24:48.178 --> 24:49.177
Yeah.

24:49.179 --> 24:50.311
Well, that story he told you

24:50.313 --> 24:51.947
matches the story
he told in court

24:51.949 --> 24:54.282
and the story he told the cops
when they interviewed him.

24:54.284 --> 24:57.285
Of course he would remember
every detail.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.787
His wife was murdered.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.523
It's not just the details,
Mr. Reese, verbatim.

25:01.525 --> 25:03.958
"That kind of relentless snow
that makes you forget

25:03.960 --> 25:06.594
there was ever
a world without it."

25:06.596 --> 25:09.497
It's as if Edwards memorized
that speech,

25:09.499 --> 25:11.099
but why would he do that?

25:11.101 --> 25:13.201
So, I've been going through

25:13.203 --> 25:16.637
the cell company's GPS records
for Edwards' phone.

25:16.639 --> 25:18.973
He wasn't coming home
when his wife was killed.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.975
He didn't arrive
until several hours later,

25:20.977 --> 25:24.045
which means he couldn't have
seen his wife's killer

25:24.047 --> 25:26.280
leaving the scene.
He lied.

25:26.282 --> 25:28.482
He didn't just lie, Finch.

25:28.484 --> 25:30.818
Edwards is the one
who bought the gun.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.153
He bought a gun
under Morris's name?

25:33.155 --> 25:34.955
Mr. Reese,
it's another frame job.

25:34.957 --> 25:37.157
Seven years ago,
Edwards perjured himself

25:37.159 --> 25:39.059
to make sure that the man
he believed had killed his wife

25:39.061 --> 25:40.727
would go away to prison.

25:40.729 --> 25:42.496
And now Morris is out early,

25:42.498 --> 25:46.032
and only seven years
for his wife's murder.

25:46.034 --> 25:47.801
I'd be angry too.

25:47.803 --> 25:52.038
So now, Edwards is planning
to put him away... for good.

26:03.825 --> 26:05.959
Edwards is
heading back home now.

26:05.961 --> 26:08.828
He's been pretty careful
about not touching that gun.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.930
It's possible he means
to kill Morris with that gun

26:10.932 --> 26:12.565
and make it look
like self defense.

26:12.567 --> 26:14.834
Get this, right after
Morris was released,

26:14.836 --> 26:16.302
he got a text message
from his brother

26:16.304 --> 26:18.404
saying your guy would be
at the gala.

26:18.406 --> 26:19.905
Edwards must have
spoofed the text

26:19.907 --> 26:21.674
to make sure that Morris
would show up.

26:21.676 --> 26:23.309
Then he blew up his own car
to make it look

26:23.311 --> 26:25.144
like Morris tried to kill him.

26:25.146 --> 26:26.779
Whatever Edwards' plan is,

26:26.781 --> 26:28.748
it could end in someone's death,
including his own.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.116
We have to stop him.

26:30.118 --> 26:32.484
Stop him?
We should give him a medal.

26:32.486 --> 26:35.420
This bastard killed his wife and
he's walking the streets free.

26:35.422 --> 26:37.489
Edwards lied in his testimony.

26:37.491 --> 26:39.491
Have you considered
that Morris might be innocent?

26:39.493 --> 26:42.427
The man was obsessed.
He didn't have a solid alibi,

26:42.429 --> 26:43.828
no other suspect to speak of.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.631
Precisely.
All the evidence against him

26:45.633 --> 26:47.799
was purely circumstantial.

26:47.801 --> 26:50.502
Morris has always maintained
his innocence.

26:50.504 --> 26:52.337
It could be that he's
telling the truth,

26:52.339 --> 26:54.773
and we may never know
what really happened.

26:54.775 --> 26:58.709
Guys, we don't even know
what's happening now.

26:58.711 --> 27:01.012
Edwards just popped open
a round

27:01.014 --> 27:02.713
and poured out the gunpowder.

27:04.516 --> 27:06.617
And I'm betting things won't go
too well for Morris

27:06.619 --> 27:09.120
when Edwards plants
gunshot residue on him.

27:09.122 --> 27:11.022
If Edwards has figured out
how to put this guy away,

27:11.024 --> 27:12.657
he should go for it.

27:12.659 --> 27:14.692
One less killer
walking the streets.

27:14.694 --> 27:16.494
Oh, he's figured it out.

27:16.496 --> 27:19.096
The tape on his lapels picked up
Morris's fingerprints.

27:19.098 --> 27:22.232
So now Edwards is holding
a gun with Morris's prints.

27:22.234 --> 27:25.369
It seems fairly obvious
he intends to use it on someone.

27:25.371 --> 27:27.338
We cannot sanction murder.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.072
We don't know if it's murder.

27:29.074 --> 27:31.842
None of Edwards' frames
have ended in death before.

27:31.844 --> 27:33.443
Mr. Reese, we wouldn't be
focused on him

27:33.445 --> 27:35.545
if something bad wasn't
about to happen.

27:35.547 --> 27:39.349
I'm saying he doesn't look
like a killer to me.

27:39.351 --> 27:41.551
He looks like a man who's lost.

27:44.156 --> 27:45.522
Hey.

27:45.524 --> 27:47.023
Sorry, I'm a little early.

27:47.025 --> 27:48.425
No problem. Uh--

27:49.828 --> 27:51.260
Sounds like Hector's
looking forward

27:51.262 --> 27:55.665
to spending time with you.
I'll go get him.

27:55.667 --> 27:58.368
Got someone here for ya.

27:58.370 --> 28:00.837
- Here she is. Here she is.
- Hey, hi.

28:00.839 --> 28:03.272
Yeah.

28:03.274 --> 28:04.874
You sure you don't mind?

28:04.876 --> 28:07.243
Oh, I'm happy to watch him
as long as you need me to.

28:07.245 --> 28:09.345
Thanks.
Something came up

28:09.347 --> 28:11.881
I gotta take care of
tonight, so--

28:11.883 --> 28:14.717
Everything okay?

28:14.719 --> 28:17.186
Yeah.
I think it will be, yeah.

28:18.388 --> 28:19.788
Thanks again for watching him.

28:19.790 --> 28:21.423
Of course.

28:23.526 --> 28:24.526
Bye.

28:29.866 --> 28:33.369
Okay, Finch,
Edwards is clearing out.

28:33.371 --> 28:36.872
Whatever his plan is,
it's gonna happen soon.

28:36.874 --> 28:38.606
Hey, I think I got
a lead on our killer.

28:38.608 --> 28:40.075
When Morris was in prison,
his brother Sid

28:40.077 --> 28:41.910
never missed a visit.
If Morris isn't

28:41.912 --> 28:44.145
at his brother's place,
he knows where he's hiding.

28:44.147 --> 28:46.081
Edwards might be
thinking the same thing.

28:46.083 --> 28:48.483
Looks like he's heading
for the brother's apartment.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.689
Okay, Finch,
Edwards just broke in.

29:17.078 --> 29:20.080
Mr. Reese?
What's he doing?

29:20.082 --> 29:22.783
Making it look like Morris
is following him.

29:22.785 --> 29:24.018
Where's Edwards?

29:24.020 --> 29:27.687
Here.

30:07.225 --> 30:10.127
Edwards has been
planning this for years.

30:10.129 --> 30:12.897
He can't move on.
He needs closure.

30:12.899 --> 30:15.166
Vengeance will not
bring closure.

30:15.168 --> 30:17.034
You should know that by now.

30:17.036 --> 30:19.403
It didn't for Carter,
it didn't for Shaw,

30:19.405 --> 30:21.538
and it won't bring Edwards
any peace

30:21.540 --> 30:23.074
if he's targeted the wrong man.

30:23.076 --> 30:25.476
Finch, the law doesn't
always work.

30:25.478 --> 30:27.311
Edwards is correcting
an injustice.

30:27.313 --> 30:29.680
If we deny him this,
it will destroy him.

30:29.682 --> 30:31.349
Don't make the mistake
of assuming that you're

30:31.351 --> 30:34.151
the only person that's been
down this path, Mr. Reese.

30:34.153 --> 30:37.921
So tell me, Finch,
where did that path take you?

30:41.893 --> 30:43.994
Gotta find the red queen.
Gotta find the red queen.

30:43.996 --> 30:45.762
Gotta pay to play,
pay to play, folks.

30:45.764 --> 30:48.599
Who wants to step up,
take a chance?

30:50.101 --> 30:51.502
Edwards is gone.

30:51.504 --> 30:53.003
Did he get away,
or did you--

30:53.005 --> 30:55.171
He's been doing frame jobs
for a while.

30:55.173 --> 30:57.374
He's good at covering
his tracks.

30:57.376 --> 30:58.674
He's left his phone at home,

30:58.676 --> 31:00.210
so there's no way
for us to track him.

31:00.212 --> 31:03.346
We have to find him
before it's too late.

31:05.349 --> 31:07.183
I haven't been able
to find Edwards, Mr. Reese,

31:07.185 --> 31:09.452
but I've located Morris's
cell phone signal.

31:09.454 --> 31:11.721
It's an older model
that doesn't have GPS.

31:12.188 --> 31:13.188
_

31:13.189 --> 31:16.125
Wait, this could be something.

31:20.732 --> 31:24.366
Uh...
Fusco.

31:24.368 --> 31:27.136
Detective, have you located
Morris's brother?

31:27.138 --> 31:30.272
It appears that he just sent
Morris a text message.

31:30.274 --> 31:33.942
Although I'll wager it's Edwards
spoofing a text to lure him out.

31:33.944 --> 31:36.045
Yeah, I'd say
that's a safe bet.

31:36.047 --> 31:38.747
Sid broke his cell phone while
we were having a little chat.

31:38.749 --> 31:40.749
How exactly did--

31:40.751 --> 31:42.484
Does he know where Morris is?

31:42.486 --> 31:44.285
No, but it didn't
stop the lowlife

31:44.287 --> 31:45.720
from taking a swing at me.

31:45.722 --> 31:47.321
It says to meet
at the Conservatory

31:47.323 --> 31:49.658
at the New York
Botanical Gardens.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.292
That's across town.

31:51.294 --> 31:52.427
I'm close.

31:52.429 --> 31:53.962
Could be dangerous, Finch.

31:53.964 --> 31:55.229
Which is why you should've
stopped Edwards

31:55.231 --> 31:56.598
while you had the chance.

32:05.907 --> 32:08.309
Hello?

32:08.311 --> 32:12.080
Sid?

32:12.082 --> 32:16.016
You here?

32:20.989 --> 32:22.790
I've been waiting seven years
for this.

32:42.890 --> 32:47.558
I have received direct threats
on my personal cell phone.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.361
Someone is coming after us.

32:50.363 --> 32:53.597
You tell your boss
to call me back immediately.

32:57.870 --> 32:59.804
Hello, Alicia.

32:59.806 --> 33:02.940
I'm sorry it's come to this.

33:02.942 --> 33:05.042
I'm aware
of your relentless pursuit

33:05.044 --> 33:07.177
and subsequent elimination
of the engineers

33:07.179 --> 33:08.979
involved in Northern Lights.

33:08.981 --> 33:11.281
Did you really think that while
you were watching others,

33:11.283 --> 33:13.684
no one would be watching you?

33:13.686 --> 33:15.519
I'd be careful if I were you.

33:15.521 --> 33:18.021
An improvised explosive device
is attached

33:18.023 --> 33:19.489
to the bottom of your car.

33:19.491 --> 33:22.659
Any sudden movement
could set it off.

33:32.971 --> 33:36.205
As a member of the black ops
intelligence community,

33:36.207 --> 33:39.876
I'm sure you're familiar with
the damage such a device can do.

33:42.848 --> 33:48.360
You have to understand, Nathan,
he was a dear friend.

33:48.954 --> 33:51.588
I didn't know anything
about his murder.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.992
Do you even believe yourself?

33:55.994 --> 33:58.427
You work in intelligence?
How can you not know?

33:58.429 --> 34:00.762
No. I--

34:00.764 --> 34:03.165
The second it happened,
I knew it,

34:03.167 --> 34:05.101
but I didn't know
they were gonna do it.

34:05.103 --> 34:07.503
I had no idea.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.175
You're a trained liar.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.112
How will I ever know
if you're telling the truth?

34:17.114 --> 34:20.348
You won't.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.350
But I am.

34:22.351 --> 34:26.954
Everything we did was to make
the world a safer place,

34:26.956 --> 34:31.126
but we strayed from the path.
I admit it.

34:31.128 --> 34:35.429
I have so many regrets,
but it's grown so big,

34:35.431 --> 34:40.902
and we're so...
so small.

34:40.904 --> 34:45.371
I don't know who you are
or how you know all this,

34:45.373 --> 34:48.475
but maybe you're right.

34:48.476 --> 34:52.478
Maybe Nathan's death,
it is my fault.

34:52.481 --> 34:55.917
I saw the signs.
I ignored them.

34:55.918 --> 34:59.586
Maybe I deserve this.

35:36.256 --> 35:38.057
Dump that on your hands.

35:49.869 --> 35:51.804
- Gunpowder?
- Do it.

35:56.709 --> 35:59.944
Dr. Edwards.

35:59.946 --> 36:02.981
Harold, what are you doing here?

36:02.983 --> 36:06.684
I may not have been completely
honest with you in our session,

36:06.686 --> 36:09.286
but you were right.

36:09.288 --> 36:11.888
We've both been
down the same road,

36:11.890 --> 36:14.625
but if there's one thing
I've learned,

36:14.627 --> 36:19.196
it's that revenge will never
bring you closure.

36:19.198 --> 36:20.364
You gotta help me.

36:20.366 --> 36:21.532
Shut up!

36:21.534 --> 36:22.833
I'm not a murderer.

36:22.835 --> 36:24.135
You're a liar.

36:24.137 --> 36:27.904
I dropped the package
off to her

36:27.906 --> 36:32.075
in the morning,
and that's all I did.

36:32.077 --> 36:35.078
I didn't like leaving packages
at people's doorsteps

36:35.080 --> 36:37.014
during the holidays.

36:37.016 --> 36:41.551
A lot of thieves.
A lot of bad people out there.

36:41.553 --> 36:46.256
I made sure she signed for it,
and then I left.

36:49.059 --> 36:51.661
And I never came back
that night.

36:51.663 --> 36:54.264
You really expect me to believe
that's why you kept going back?

36:54.266 --> 36:56.199
I know you killed her.

37:01.204 --> 37:04.774
This is where you met.

37:04.776 --> 37:06.909
Where you proposed.

37:06.911 --> 37:09.679
Why would you desecrate
her memory by committing murder

37:09.681 --> 37:11.681
in the place
where you were happiest?

37:11.683 --> 37:13.716
Who said anything about murder?

37:21.891 --> 37:24.626
When they search his apartment,

37:24.628 --> 37:27.429
they'll find evidence
he's been plotting to kill me.

37:27.431 --> 37:29.931
With the gunshot residue
on his hands,

37:29.933 --> 37:32.067
there won't be any doubt
he pulled the trigger.

37:32.069 --> 37:35.236
They'll put you away
for the rest of your life,

37:35.238 --> 37:37.305
and there won't be anything
you can do to stop it.

37:39.742 --> 37:43.712
After I pull the trigger,
tell them he shot me.

37:43.714 --> 37:48.149
Do that, and then everything
will fall into place.

37:48.151 --> 37:50.484
Harold, whoever you are,
I'm begging you,

37:50.486 --> 37:53.887
let me have this.

37:53.889 --> 37:54.888
Harold.

37:55.990 --> 37:57.057
Move away.

37:57.059 --> 37:59.893
John, don't shoot.

37:59.895 --> 38:03.431
Shane, listen to me.

38:03.433 --> 38:06.834
I watched someone close to me
die before my eyes.

38:06.836 --> 38:10.771
Like you, I thought
I needed to make sure

38:10.773 --> 38:13.140
that everyone responsible
for that murder

38:13.142 --> 38:18.578
paid with their life,
and that almost did it.

38:18.580 --> 38:22.415
I had my target,
I had my finger on the trigger,

38:22.417 --> 38:25.418
but I realized that
as certain as I was

38:25.420 --> 38:28.455
that these people deserved
retribution,

38:28.457 --> 38:34.026
that life was infinitely
more complicated than that.

38:34.028 --> 38:36.363
You may never know what happened
on that day,

38:36.365 --> 38:39.431
but if you do this,
if you condemn his life,

38:39.433 --> 38:42.368
there will be no doubt
what you did to him.

38:44.337 --> 38:47.473
Even when your world stops,
the world around you

38:47.475 --> 38:49.842
keeps moving forward,
and you will too,

38:49.844 --> 38:53.780
but if you die here, that
bright, beautiful, lively woman

38:53.782 --> 38:57.316
that fell in love with you here
will forever die with you.

38:58.951 --> 39:01.820
I know you don't want that.

39:28.847 --> 39:31.683
You're even less chatty
than usual.

39:31.685 --> 39:34.118
It's a long night.

39:35.587 --> 39:37.254
Want to talk about it?

39:41.327 --> 39:44.195
Okay.

39:44.197 --> 39:46.596
How about we discuss
payback instead?

39:48.200 --> 39:51.035
I got you into the gala.
Now you give me

39:51.037 --> 39:54.271
something real about yourself.
No more shutting me out.

39:54.273 --> 39:57.708
Tell me something
you're not so proud of,

39:57.710 --> 40:00.311
starting with how you
deal with grief.

40:07.618 --> 40:11.321
There was a woman once.

40:15.259 --> 40:17.327
She meant everything to me.

40:23.100 --> 40:27.237
I kept her at arm's length.

40:27.239 --> 40:30.907
I went away for a long time.

40:33.210 --> 40:35.711
Then I learned she died.

40:37.947 --> 40:39.582
So what happened?

40:44.488 --> 40:47.390
Talk to me, John.
If you ever want to be able

40:47.392 --> 40:51.193
to move on, you have to grieve.

40:53.462 --> 40:57.732
I'm not sure I know
how to do that.

41:07.343 --> 41:08.743
There he is.

41:08.745 --> 41:10.612
Aw, he missed you.

41:10.614 --> 41:13.615
Hey, boy.

41:13.617 --> 41:15.349
Thanks for looking after him.

41:15.351 --> 41:17.919
Any time.

41:17.921 --> 41:19.687
Did you get everything
taken care of?

41:19.689 --> 41:23.658
Um, still working on it.
Think it's gonna be okay.

41:23.660 --> 41:26.560
I'm glad to hear it.

41:33.302 --> 41:37.805
Maybe we can walk him
together sometime.

41:37.807 --> 41:39.640
Maybe.

42:11.005 --> 42:13.940
Want to go?

42:17.310 --> 42:21.013
It looks like Edwards might
finally be starting to move on.

42:21.015 --> 42:22.314
What about Morris?

42:22.316 --> 42:23.916
Did he kill Edwards' wife
or not?

42:23.918 --> 42:26.218
That's a question
between him and his maker.

42:26.220 --> 42:29.755
Perhaps we should follow
our own advice and let him go.

42:29.757 --> 42:31.923
That's not good enough.

42:31.925 --> 42:34.193
The machine's got to know
the truth.

42:34.195 --> 42:38.397
It may, and the truth
will likely remain with it.

42:38.399 --> 42:41.833
As frustrating
as it might seem,

42:41.835 --> 42:44.903
some questions may
never be answered.

42:44.905 --> 42:47.205
But what I do know is this--

42:47.207 --> 42:51.242
If Morris is a killer
and tries to kill again,

42:51.244 --> 42:53.277
we'll be there.

42:54.847 --> 42:57.448
Come on.
Come on.

43:08.077 --> 43:12.295
