00:28.329 --> 00:31.832
<i>Dasvidaniya suka!</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:33.234
You speak Russian?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.737
I can only say two things.

00:36.648 --> 00:37.648
And the other one.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.652
[alarm buzzes]

00:52.686 --> 00:53.886
[grumbles]

00:56.223 --> 00:57.825
[alarm buzzes]

00:57.857 --> 01:00.527
[struggling]

01:00.561 --> 01:02.429
[alarm buzzes]

01:02.462 --> 01:04.399
[grunting]

01:04.432 --> 01:05.734
-Yes!
-[alarm buzzes]

01:05.768 --> 01:08.602
Oh, God! Are you shittin' me?

01:08.635 --> 01:11.337
[Joker laughing]

01:11.370 --> 01:12.373
Joker!

01:12.406 --> 01:17.356
-This is my score.
-Well, it was.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.313
[clicks open]

01:20.347 --> 01:22.183
But it's mine now.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.817
The only reason
you're getting this
and I'm not,

01:23.817 --> 01:26.087
is you got a bunch of goons
that do whatever you say.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.355
That's not true!

01:27.388 --> 01:29.322
Goons, throw Harley out.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.990
[both]
Whatever you say, boss.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.025
Whoa!

01:38.799 --> 01:41.001
[sighs] I need a fucking crew.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.271
No, you need a shower.

01:43.304 --> 01:47.275
[theme music playing]

01:47.308 --> 01:49.176
So, you didn't get the warhead?

01:49.176 --> 01:52.112
No. Joker stole it
'cause he had a crew.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.513
Like all real supervillains.

01:53.548 --> 01:55.750
I mean, I get by
just fine on my own. So...

01:55.784 --> 01:59.085
[coughing sarcastically]
Your independence
is quite inspiring.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.921
-Oh, can it, Frank.
-I love you, Ivy.

02:00.956 --> 02:02.891
You know, Ive,
I could have really used
your help out there.

02:02.924 --> 02:06.161
Honestly, I really think that
crews are over-rated.

02:06.194 --> 02:10.097
You know, it's like,
some very successful
supervillains work alone.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.133
Like look at this guy.
Look at Dr. Psycho.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.469
Perfect example.

02:13.469 --> 02:16.169
<i>Doesn't have a crew,</i>
<i>yet still taking on</i>
<i>Wonder Woman.</i>

02:16.203 --> 02:18.372
<i>Like a champ.</i>

02:18.406 --> 02:21.105
[people screaming]

02:24.377 --> 02:27.713
Still too scared to fight me
with your own hands, Psycho?

02:27.747 --> 02:30.217
What a grand idea!

02:30.251 --> 02:32.485
[choking]

02:32.485 --> 02:33.454
[laughing]

02:33.454 --> 02:35.723
I'm sorry. What's that?

02:35.757 --> 02:40.757
You really want your last words
to be... [mimics choking]

02:41.861 --> 02:44.564
[Wonder Woman screams]

02:44.598 --> 02:48.669
-That really hurt, you [bleep]!
-[all gasp]

02:48.701 --> 02:49.735
[gasps]

02:49.770 --> 02:53.139
[both gasp]

02:53.174 --> 02:54.437
Holy shit!

02:54.437 --> 02:57.444
Well, see! If he had a crew,
that would have told him
to use the B word instead.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.881
And if I had one,
I'd use that warhead
to blackmail Gotham

03:00.913 --> 03:02.282
into naming a highway after me.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.951
Huh? A highway. All right.

03:03.951 --> 03:07.830
Well, you know,
that took a weird turn.
[slurps]

03:08.588 --> 03:11.058
[sighs in frustration] Mmm.

03:11.092 --> 03:14.562
So you're certain this whole
[bleep] thing is gonna
blow over, right?

03:14.594 --> 03:17.431
-Oh, yeah.
-Sure, yeah. A few talk show
appearances...

03:17.465 --> 03:20.133
-Cry about how you love
your wife.
-[laughing]

03:20.133 --> 03:21.669
It's exactly what we had
Mr. Freeze do

03:21.669 --> 03:24.104
when he exposed himself
at the Gotham water park.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.209
You guys fixed that?
Wow, you're good.

03:26.241 --> 03:31.145
-And by good, I mean bad!
-[both laughing]

03:31.177 --> 03:32.312
Come on!

03:32.346 --> 03:34.115
Ms. Quinn,
we've been expecting you.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.117
-Thank you.
-Let's get you henched up.

03:37.151 --> 03:39.387
That's Cronk.
He's muscle.

03:39.419 --> 03:42.223
If you don't mind
crazy roid rage,
he's your man.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.725
-The Professor, he's brainy.
-So smart.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.627
He's not brainy
with names though, huh?

03:46.661 --> 03:48.762
-Oh, my God, so right.
-[both laughing]

03:48.795 --> 03:49.862
Beautiful.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.665
Meet Blaze!

03:51.699 --> 03:54.502
-Explosive.
Lotta buzz on him.
-Boom.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.169
-Lotta chatter.
-[making chatter effect]

03:56.203 --> 03:58.173
Lotta heat.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.774
Yes, and if you don't
take him today, he'll have
seven offers tomorrow.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.575
-Goodbye.
-Hell, I'll take 'em all.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.344
I'll crush Joker with
this team behind me.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.114
-I thought you were
his girlfriend.
-No.

04:06.147 --> 04:08.616
-I dumped that bum weeks ago.
-You didn't go back to him?

04:08.616 --> 04:11.085
-Yeah, like you always do.
-No. I'm on my own now.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.687
So, when can these guys start?

04:13.721 --> 04:16.189
-I'm sorry. These men
are unavailable.
-For how long?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.925
-For...
-Ever?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.392
-Yeah.
-Yeah, forever.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.896
Well, I don't need ya.
I don't need any of ya!

04:21.930 --> 04:25.100
I'll put together my own crew
who's excited to work with
a real up-and-comer.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.134
If you get back together
with Joker, our doors
are always--

04:28.168 --> 04:32.968
[people chattering
indistinctly]

04:34.040 --> 04:36.177
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

04:36.209 --> 04:37.812
Are you tired of being
a lousy sidekick?

04:37.846 --> 04:40.947
Abused, shit on,
used as a human shield?

04:40.980 --> 04:42.415
Then come work for me.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.485
You'll get top dollar,
great benefits,

04:44.519 --> 04:47.387
and I won't ever, knowingly,
send you to your deaths.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.723
[screaming]

04:48.755 --> 04:50.791
Wait, was she talking about
a job

04:50.791 --> 04:52.427
where we don't have to jump
into hell portals
and definitely die?

04:52.461 --> 04:54.661
Oh, just shut up and jump.

04:54.696 --> 04:56.930
[screaming]
I'm definitely dying!

04:56.964 --> 04:59.000
I promise you
it'll be better than that.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.403
Join me, and we'll be doing
million dollar heists
in no time.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.637
-Who's with me?
-Can't.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.338
-Busy.
-I got a family emergency.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.807
[stammering]
I have a thing.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.411
[screaming]

05:10.444 --> 05:13.146
-Assholes.
-No. No. No. No.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.781
Before you open
your female trap,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.283
no way in hell
I'm working for you.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.720
Who asked ya?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.687
Can you believe [bleep] guy's
rejecting me?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.490
[southern accent]
Well, ma'am, I don't know
nothing about that.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.994
I'm just a simply farm boy
from Oklahoma.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.697
I got two parents, three girls,
four boys, two lab mixes,

05:29.730 --> 05:33.634
both uncut on a small ranch
just outside of Muskogee.

05:33.668 --> 05:35.903
-What's your problem, weirdo?
-Why, Ms...

05:35.937 --> 05:39.939
I don't have no problem,
because I am actually...

05:39.973 --> 05:41.074
[growls]

05:41.108 --> 05:42.475
-Jeez.
-Good, fuckin' God.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.379
The name is Clayface.

05:44.413 --> 05:47.749
Thespian extraordinaire
recently portraying
the juicy role

05:47.781 --> 05:50.418
of country boy bartending
in the big city.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.786
I thought you were
playing the role of
"literal piece of shit."

05:53.819 --> 05:55.322
Not yet.

05:55.357 --> 05:59.192
-Ugh. It's in my hair.
-Now I'm a literal
piece of shit.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.028
-Okay.
-[thudding]

06:01.060 --> 06:03.230
Is it Clayface or Fuckface?

06:03.264 --> 06:07.401
Hey! Kite Man here.
Thinking about doing
a caper, gang.

06:07.435 --> 06:11.273
Not sure what,
might steal something,
might kidnap somebody.

06:11.305 --> 06:16.576
I don't know, uh,
depending on the weather.
But Kite will be involved.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.213
-Who's in?
-[all] I am! Let's do this!

06:19.245 --> 06:21.149
I do not fucking believe this.

06:21.182 --> 06:25.185
And then, they all ran off
with that loser Kite Man.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.653
Yeah.

06:26.687 --> 06:30.124
What a loser that guy is.
Did he mention my name?

06:30.156 --> 06:31.959
You know what, nevermind.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.194
-But did he?
-There must be something
I'm missing.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.430
-How do I get people
to work for me?
-She has no fuckin' idea.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.901
Because plants do all this shit
for her lazy ass.

06:39.934 --> 06:42.473
[dismissive groan]
There must be someone
who can gimme the inside scoop.

06:42.473 --> 06:46.673
Babe, what real supervillain
is gonna give away
their trade secrets?

06:46.708 --> 06:50.908
Well, maybe not "give away."

06:52.312 --> 06:56.416
[lights clank off]

06:56.449 --> 06:59.988
[thunder cracking]

07:00.021 --> 07:02.923
I am Maxie Zeus!

07:02.956 --> 07:06.259
And tonight, I "max"

07:06.293 --> 07:09.295
all your dreams come true!

07:09.329 --> 07:11.199
This guy's such a douche.

07:11.233 --> 07:13.834
I'm sorry, but none of
the charming villains
with great personalities

07:13.867 --> 07:15.403
were holding seminars today.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.773
Joker. Riddler. Two-Face.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.776
What do they have
that you don't?

07:21.809 --> 07:24.377
-[Poison Ivy] A penis?
-A crew!

07:24.411 --> 07:26.312
A villain goes in alone,

07:26.346 --> 07:29.617
but a supervillain
needs henchmen.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.088
When I robbed
the 1996 Olympics--

07:32.122 --> 07:35.656
-[crowd applauding]
-Oh, thank you very much,
just lovely. Fun times.

07:35.689 --> 07:39.427
My crew helped me
steal those medals.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.764
And now I literally sleep
on a pile of gold.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.733
Ivy, you hear that?
Sleeps on gold!

07:46.767 --> 07:49.336
Honestly, with the amount
of coke this guy does,

07:49.336 --> 07:51.810
I doubt he's sleeping
on anything.

07:51.810 --> 07:54.442
So, how does one
recruit goons?

07:54.475 --> 07:56.610
Through a henchmen agency,

07:56.644 --> 07:58.846
-or from popular villain--
-[Harley] Oh, oh, oh, oh...

07:58.879 --> 08:01.149
Yes. The juggler
in the third row.

08:01.182 --> 08:04.819
Mr. Zeus, I tried those things
and they didn't work.

08:04.851 --> 08:09.423
You can't let
rejection stop you.
Think about the big boys.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.793
Darkseid. Luthor. Maxie.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.928
-Are we quitters?
-[crowd] No!

08:15.963 --> 08:18.399
Neither are you!

08:18.432 --> 08:19.934
Okay, I'm out.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.701
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Didn't know you were busy.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.769
No, no. Come in.

08:22.803 --> 08:26.105
Just letting my legs breathe.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.142
You were so inspiring.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.547
-If you don't mind,
I got a couple questions.
-And I've got one big answer.

08:30.581 --> 08:34.682
[seductive music playing]

08:34.716 --> 08:38.352
Wow. That's just like one of
those paintings, you know,
where the eyes follow you,

08:38.385 --> 08:42.121
-except, nope, it's just your
greased-up nipples.
-Just between us,

08:42.155 --> 08:44.625
I painted it. Shh.

08:44.659 --> 08:47.662
Weird. So, hey,
I was wondering if you'd just
gimme some pointers.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.932
Well, I can certainly
give you one.

08:50.965 --> 08:54.749
Ah, got it!
So you're just a creepy dick.

08:54.749 --> 08:56.937
-I'm not fucking you.
-Oh, really?

08:56.971 --> 09:00.173
You were laughed out of UTI.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.408
Yeah! Word gets around.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.878
You'll never get a crew!

09:03.910 --> 09:07.948
Because no bad guy
will ever work for a woman.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.984
-My two cents.
-Then here's mine.

09:10.018 --> 09:13.086
See a urologist,
'cause creepy dick
wasn't just an insult,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.421
it was a concern.

09:14.455 --> 09:16.490
And if no bad guy
will work with me,

09:16.524 --> 09:19.826
then maybe I don't need
a "bad guy."

09:19.860 --> 09:21.662
Harley, I told you this,
I work alone.

09:21.696 --> 09:23.331
Alone-ish.

09:23.365 --> 09:25.732
-Don't even get me started
right now.
-Come on, Ive.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.269
With your ability to control
all plant life on Earth,

09:28.302 --> 09:31.839
and my gymnastics,
I mean, there's nothing
we can't do if we team up.

09:31.873 --> 09:34.408
I said no. I mean,
I got a brand. You know?

09:34.442 --> 09:38.111
It's like, adding gymnastics
to it, it's a very
muddled message.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.548
Tell her the real reason,
you lying motherfucker.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.318
[sighs] Oh, God, here we go.

09:44.318 --> 09:48.423
All right, so look,
there's a glass ceiling for
female supervillains, okay?

09:48.456 --> 09:52.159
Like, sure, we're tolerated,
but as long as we don't
get too powerful.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.163
-Aren't you being
a little dramatic?
-Guess whose naive ass

09:55.196 --> 09:57.817
who hasn't heard of
the Queen of Fables.

09:57.817 --> 10:01.034
Go on, Ivy, tell your story.
I'll set the mood.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.203
All right, all right.
Thanks, Frank.

10:03.238 --> 10:07.174
<i>So, a long time ago,</i>
<i>way back in the '80s.</i>
<i>There was this</i>

10:07.207 --> 10:12.207
<i>powerful sorceress, right?</i>
<i>She's known as</i>
<i>the Queen of Fables.</i>

10:13.347 --> 10:16.418
<i>Fed up of being a footnote</i>
<i>to the male supervillains,</i>

10:16.451 --> 10:21.288
<i>she decided to turn Gotham</i>
<i>into an evil force</i>
<i>by using sorcery</i>

10:21.322 --> 10:25.860
<i>to pull characters</i>
<i>from the pages of storybooks.</i>

10:25.893 --> 10:30.230
<i>Until she had a whole army</i>
<i>at her command.</i>

10:30.264 --> 10:35.264
-Well, what happened to her?
-Ask her yourself.

10:35.937 --> 10:37.572
[woman speaking indistinctly]

10:37.605 --> 10:41.676
FYI, bailin' out
your klepto aunt
with the snow globe fetish

10:41.708 --> 10:43.577
does not count. Next.

10:43.611 --> 10:47.615
-Uh, hey, I'm looking for
the Queen of Fables?
-Just found her, sweetie.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.750
No. Why you lookin'
up there for? Here.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.386
The book. Me.
I'm stuck in this bullshit.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.855
I've got 20 minutes
till my next appointment.
What's up?

10:54.889 --> 10:58.125
Hey, my name's Harley Quinn.
I'm a new supervillain,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.160
and I was told
I should ask
what happened to you.

11:00.195 --> 11:04.732
[sighs and coughs]
All right, buckle up,
honey, it's story time.

11:04.765 --> 11:09.136
<i>So there I was with my crew,</i>
<i>a bunch of dumb</i>
<i>storybook things,</i>

11:09.169 --> 11:14.169
<i>when the heroes showed up.</i>
<i>Ugh! It was a horror.</i>

11:20.248 --> 11:22.783
No, no, no. There's no way
Superman did that.

11:22.817 --> 11:24.919
I exaggerate to add flavor.

11:24.952 --> 11:31.548
<i>But the truth is,</i>
<i>they punished me in a way
no one has ever been punished.</i>

11:31.548 --> 11:35.196
No!

11:35.230 --> 11:39.767
[sighs] Instead of
throwing me into Arkham
like any male villain,

11:39.799 --> 11:42.169
they came up
with this bullshit.

11:42.202 --> 11:46.014
I mean, a guy robs a bank,
he's a criminal mastermind.

11:46.014 --> 11:48.307
-A woman robs a bank--
-She's a crazy bitch.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.211
Exactly! Think about it.

11:50.245 --> 11:53.379
A male supervillain
can literally look like
a deformed penguin,

11:53.380 --> 11:57.085
but God forbid we outshine them
even a little bit,

11:57.118 --> 12:00.922
and into the fucking
tax book we go, forever.

12:00.955 --> 12:03.091
Yeah, you can get
as big as you want,

12:03.124 --> 12:06.626
-as long as you don't get
bigger than them.
-Yeah. You get it.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.029
And your ambition
won't just hurt you,

12:09.029 --> 12:11.198
it'll hurt the people
you care most about.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.668
-Birthday cake for the boss
at 4:00.
-Thanks, Mark.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.571
God, I hate this place.

12:16.605 --> 12:20.307
But at least I'm not
on the streets turning tricks
for cash anymore.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.211
[grumbles]
Who knows. Maybe your story
will turn out different.

12:23.211 --> 12:25.913
I couldn't get a crew
'cause no one believed in me.

12:25.947 --> 12:29.984
So I had to make my own
by believing in stupid little
things like Mark.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.253
-No offense, Mark.
-[Mark sighs]

12:32.287 --> 12:35.657
-Queen of Fables,
pretty fun, right?
-Oh, she was pretty bleak.

12:35.690 --> 12:38.424
Before I left she was like,
"I have to use the bathroom.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.061
There, I did it."

12:40.094 --> 12:41.928
Did you send me to her
because you think
I can't do this?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.173
No, Harley, I sent you there
because I know that you can.

12:45.173 --> 12:49.035
Look... [sighs]
I just wanted you to know
what you're up against,

12:49.070 --> 12:52.340
you know,
'cause I, uh... I love ya.

12:52.373 --> 12:55.308
-Don't make a thing of it.
-[Frank crying]

12:55.341 --> 12:56.844
[wails]

12:56.876 --> 12:59.613
Anybody feel this shit but me?

12:59.647 --> 13:02.649
A man can't show emotion!

13:02.682 --> 13:04.183
A man?

13:04.216 --> 13:05.216
Fuck you, Ivy.

13:05.216 --> 13:08.657
Look, I appreciate your warning
but what Queen of Fables
made me realize,

13:08.657 --> 13:12.058
is if I want a crew,
I shouldn't be looking for
scumbags who believe in me,

13:12.092 --> 13:16.196
I should be looking for
scumbags no one else
believes in.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.865
Right, okay.

13:17.899 --> 13:20.934
So, so, so,
that was the take away
from the chain-smoking book,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.836
-and the trick turning cookie?
-Yeah!

13:22.870 --> 13:24.437
And I know just where to start.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.408
[audience applauds]

13:26.441 --> 13:29.878
Welcome back.
We have here Dr. Psycho.

13:29.912 --> 13:34.881
-[audience boos]
-He says he's here to apologize
for using the C word.

13:34.916 --> 13:37.551
-[woman] Woman hater!
-What? [laughing]

13:37.585 --> 13:39.687
Hate women? I cherish them.

13:39.687 --> 13:44.687
No one on God's green Earth
respects women like this one.

13:44.725 --> 13:46.962
I know. I know. Giganta,

13:46.995 --> 13:49.931
girl, how you feelin'
about all this?

13:49.964 --> 13:51.600
She is devastated,

13:51.600 --> 13:55.102
that the world is attacking
a man she knows is so kind,

13:55.135 --> 13:58.004
-is so loving--
-Let's hear it
in her own words.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.706
Those are her own words.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.043
I'm a telepath, right?

14:02.076 --> 14:04.845
She thinks it, I say it.
Isn't that right, honey?

14:04.845 --> 14:05.947
-[audience boo]
-She said "Right."

14:05.947 --> 14:07.782
She did not say "Right"!

14:07.815 --> 14:09.817
Did y'all hear her say "Right"?

14:09.850 --> 14:14.456
-She was talking to me!
-Mmm-hmm.

14:14.489 --> 14:20.159
An individual person
who exists outside of you!

14:20.160 --> 14:23.398
-Go, girl.
-A person who, for years
you mind controlled...

14:23.431 --> 14:25.399
-Don't do this.
-...into thinking
they loved you!

14:25.432 --> 14:29.604
-Do not do this!
-A person who is leaving you!

14:29.638 --> 14:34.638
-Why, you get back here,
you miserable... [bleep]
-[all gasp]

14:35.542 --> 14:36.591
[gasps]

14:41.447 --> 14:43.317
Holy shit!

14:43.350 --> 14:46.721
He just became the least
employable person on Earth.

14:46.721 --> 14:49.091
Exactly.

14:49.456 --> 14:53.059
So, you know, I thought,
hey, maybe you should
join me and my crew.

14:53.094 --> 14:54.928
[chuckles] Join you?

14:54.961 --> 14:57.210
I'm in the big leagues, mama.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.768
The L.O.D.

14:58.768 --> 15:00.768
The Legion of Doom.

15:00.801 --> 15:02.302
Hard pass!

15:02.336 --> 15:05.139
<i>We cannot condone
Dr. Psycho's use of the C Word,</i>

15:05.173 --> 15:07.575
<i>as it does not represent</i>
<i>our brand of evil.</i>

15:07.609 --> 15:10.711
<i>We hereby banish him</i>
<i>from the Legion of Doom,</i>

15:10.745 --> 15:14.014
<i>Legion of Doom Europe,</i>
<i>and The Junior Doomers</i>
<i>of America.</i>

15:14.048 --> 15:15.749
Did I say hard pass?

15:15.783 --> 15:17.518
I meant soft accept.

15:17.551 --> 15:18.885
I wanna join your crew.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.722
Not because I think
working for a female

15:20.722 --> 15:24.557
will help rehabilitate
my ruined image,
blah, blah, blah...

15:24.557 --> 15:26.059
It's for other reasons.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.861
I don't hate women!

15:27.894 --> 15:29.496
Kinda seems like you do.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.432
Whoo-hoo, the salty language
that comes outta your mouth.

15:32.466 --> 15:35.200
I'm just glad my Mama Jean
ain't allowed to hear it.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.673
Even hot southern bartender
character thinks you're
a piece of shit.

15:38.706 --> 15:42.278
But I believe in you,
and I think you have
a part to play.

15:42.278 --> 15:43.577
Did you say a "part"?

15:43.610 --> 15:48.014
Then you must also require
the services of...

15:48.048 --> 15:49.549
-Oh!
-Fuck, not again.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.851
-...an actor!
-You're damn right I do.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.354
You, me, and Psycho.

15:53.354 --> 15:56.856
This is gonna be the start
of something huge.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.859
So, what's our first
evil scheme?

15:58.859 --> 16:00.793
Is it a nuke in a volcano?

16:00.827 --> 16:04.399
Evil scheme?
Oh, a honey pot heist

16:04.399 --> 16:08.436
where I seduce Gotham's mayor
with my saucy Sheila character?

16:08.469 --> 16:12.131
How do you feel about
petty, personal vendettas?

16:14.408 --> 16:17.043
No, I'd say more unsettling
than creepy.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.748
No, disturbing.
That's it. Found it.

16:19.780 --> 16:21.981
All right, we're gonna steal
this asshole's gold medals

16:21.981 --> 16:23.518
and anything else
we can get out hands on.

16:23.518 --> 16:26.287
-Like the saying goes...
-"Hell hath no fury

16:26.320 --> 16:28.154
like a woman scorned."

16:28.188 --> 16:30.258
Oh, I was gonna say,
"The prick has it coming."

16:30.291 --> 16:32.691
But yeah, I like
your fancy way better.

16:38.033 --> 16:40.835
All right, here's the plan.
Me and Psycho will go in
through the back,

16:40.868 --> 16:42.375
find his loot,
and clean him out.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.873
Clayface, you go knock
on the front door,
pretend to be the mailman

16:44.905 --> 16:48.342
-to distract him.
-What do we know about
this mailman?

16:48.375 --> 16:51.946
What are his dreams?
His fears, his raison d'etre?

16:51.946 --> 16:53.371
Who gives a shit?
You're just a mailman.

16:53.371 --> 16:55.481
Brilliant!
That's what the world sees.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.684
Just a mailman.

16:56.717 --> 16:59.287
But we... [chuckles]
We know better, don't we?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.654
He was a horribly neglected
little boy,

17:01.688 --> 17:03.323
and he grew up in a cage!

17:03.357 --> 17:05.794
The only time he heard
rumblings from
the outside world

17:05.826 --> 17:10.663
was when the mailman came,
which is why he spent
his whole life dreaming

17:10.663 --> 17:11.996
of being one.

17:11.996 --> 17:15.269
Yeah, no. None of that.
You're just a mailman.
Deliver the mail.

17:15.303 --> 17:18.472
-Oh! She demands perfection,
doesn't she?
-[groans]

17:18.506 --> 17:20.607
-And she'll get it.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.010
My mind is awhirl with
a delicious new character

17:24.045 --> 17:27.194
-who you'll soon meet.
-No, I can't even.

17:29.115 --> 17:32.952
Who dares disturb a living god,

17:32.987 --> 17:34.288
after 9:00 p.m.?

17:34.321 --> 17:36.289
Here's your mail... Dad.

17:36.324 --> 17:37.958
-Dad?
-Years ago

17:37.991 --> 17:40.228
you met my ma
in a piano bar,

17:40.260 --> 17:41.895
and knew you must have her.

17:41.929 --> 17:44.432
Damn what your parents thought.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.667
She might have been
from the wrong side
of the tracks,

17:46.701 --> 17:49.470
but she was on the right side
of your heart.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.204
-The fuck is he doing?
-I'm done.

17:51.239 --> 17:53.173
It's really you?

17:53.207 --> 17:55.808
I... I thought
I'd lost you forever

17:55.843 --> 17:57.644
after Piano Bar Janet said she

17:57.679 --> 18:00.480
-"took care of it."
-Oh, she tried.

18:00.515 --> 18:03.116
-But it didn't take.
-Of course it didn't.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.299
For you are half god!

18:08.455 --> 18:12.594
So, who do you need me
to mind control
to open the door?

18:12.626 --> 18:15.229
No, no, no one.
Just squeeze in
the crawl space,

18:15.229 --> 18:16.931
get into the house,
and open it from the inside.

18:16.931 --> 18:18.432
Are you shittin' me?

18:18.465 --> 18:21.501
I'm a genius telepath,
why you wasting me on this?

18:21.501 --> 18:23.170
You're the only thing
small enough to fit.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.570
Got it.

18:24.605 --> 18:28.142
Son of a bitch!

18:28.174 --> 18:29.544
-[thudding]
-Argh!

18:29.576 --> 18:32.646
My eyelashes just touched
a dead raccoon!

18:32.680 --> 18:34.647
Quit your bitchin'
and keep going.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.284
God this is humiliating.

18:36.317 --> 18:39.252
[Maxie Zeus] Son,
we have much
to catch up on.

18:39.287 --> 18:42.723
Yes, Father. Or should
I call you... Dad?

18:42.757 --> 18:46.359
Call me almighty Zeus.
God of the sky and thunder.

18:46.394 --> 18:50.463
Supreme ruler of Olympus,
and all of Earth below.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.098
Okey-doke.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.568
[Dr. Psycho] Wow!
And I'm an egomaniac.

18:54.602 --> 18:56.369
[Harley] Yeah.
This looks about right.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.405
Where the fuck
does he keep
those stupid medals?

18:58.439 --> 19:01.107
Easy. He said he literally
sleeps on a pile of gold.

19:01.142 --> 19:03.243
[grunts]

19:03.277 --> 19:05.480
And then after getting
the Medal of Honor in war

19:05.512 --> 19:08.214
I toured the world
playing ping-pong.

19:08.249 --> 19:11.451
What a remarkable journey
your life has been.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.288
And so oddly similar to that
of Forrest Gump.

19:14.323 --> 19:19.160
It is rather strange
you don't share your mother's
brilliant blue eyes.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.928
My mistake, I guess.

19:20.961 --> 19:22.730
Trick of the light.

19:22.763 --> 19:26.967
Although I don't know how
you avoided her family
proclivity for...

19:27.000 --> 19:28.368
Hunchback?

19:28.402 --> 19:33.051
Ah-ha! The Olympic gold medals.

19:35.343 --> 19:36.978
What the hell?

19:37.011 --> 19:39.913
Son, you are the spitting image
of your mother.

19:39.948 --> 19:43.116
[lisping]
I'm so glad you think so,
Daddy Zeus.

19:43.150 --> 19:46.053
But it's so sad she suffered
from a lisp.

19:46.053 --> 19:49.523
Oh, you lying piece of shit!

19:49.557 --> 19:52.893
Do you really think
I'd fall for this?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.127
Perhaps?

19:54.161 --> 19:55.895
Who do you work for,
monstrosity?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.064
Joker?

19:57.096 --> 19:58.532
Oh, no, you didn't!

19:58.566 --> 20:00.901
Wait, wait, wait,
don't emasculate him.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.502
Riddler?

20:02.537 --> 20:05.605
No, no, no,
he's about to rally.
I can feel it.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.842
The Penguin?

20:07.875 --> 20:12.680
Tell me who you work for,
creature, or the next blow
will be a killing one.

20:12.713 --> 20:15.482
He works for me,
you oily bitch!

20:15.482 --> 20:19.252
Well, if it isn't the girl
I chose not to have sex with.

20:19.287 --> 20:21.654
Regrettably, you're too late
I'm afraid.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.589
[whimpers] No!

20:23.624 --> 20:26.294
[screams]

20:26.326 --> 20:27.761
[lisping] Thanks, Psycho.

20:27.796 --> 20:29.396
All right, dickhead.
Just drop the lisp.

20:29.430 --> 20:33.000
I wish I could,
but I bit my tongue.

20:33.034 --> 20:36.069
You said no woman
could ever get
a crew of bad guys.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.397
Well, I didn't just get
bad guys,

20:38.397 --> 20:41.008
I got two of the fuckin' worst.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.442
You call that a crew?

20:42.477 --> 20:45.846
A midget and a mudslide?
[laughs]

20:45.880 --> 20:48.449
I'll give you once chance
to tell the world

20:48.482 --> 20:50.817
Harley Quinn's crew
ain't nothing to fuck with.

20:50.851 --> 20:53.153
Or what?

20:53.186 --> 20:55.287
[snaps finger]

21:00.662 --> 21:02.128
Fine.

21:02.163 --> 21:06.307
-I'll say it.
-Oh, I know you will.

21:07.769 --> 21:11.570
Motivational speaker,
and self-proclaimed
supervillain,

21:11.570 --> 21:13.641
Maxie Zeus, was found
beaten this morning.

21:13.674 --> 21:16.477
-[Maxie Zeus groans]
-Oh, oh! Follow me, follow me.

21:16.510 --> 21:18.880
Mr. Zeus, how did this happen?

21:18.913 --> 21:20.913
Who did this terrible thing
to you?

21:20.948 --> 21:23.018
All I can say is,

21:23.050 --> 21:26.621
Harley Quinn's crew
ain't nothing to fuck with.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.323
Sounds like Harley Quinn,
former girlfriend of the Joker,

21:29.356 --> 21:31.726
<i>is striking out on her own.</i>

21:31.759 --> 21:34.327
Holy fucking shit, Harls.
You did it.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.198
I would not
have seen that coming.

21:36.230 --> 21:40.201
It's been 30 long years
since a female villain
had a crew.

21:40.234 --> 21:43.003
<i>When the Queen of Fables</i>
<i>tried to smash through</i>
<i>that glass ceiling</i>

21:43.038 --> 21:46.339
<i>but was imprisoned in</i>
<i>the US Tax Code by</i>
<i>The Justice League.</i>

21:46.339 --> 21:48.075
'Cause they're bitches.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.442
But I'll be damned.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.944
Harley's actually going for it.

21:50.944 --> 21:53.346
<i>One thing's for sure,</i>
<i>the Joker's ex</i>

21:53.381 --> 21:56.616
<i>may soon become</i>
<i>his biggest competitor.</i>

21:56.651 --> 22:00.186
<i>-This is...</i>
-[gun firing]

22:00.221 --> 22:02.557
Well, you know,
congratulations.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.526
I mean, I know gold medals
aren't a nuclear warhead,

22:05.559 --> 22:07.027
but you gonna start somewhere.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.261
Oh, no, I got a warhead.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.363
I traded
the gold medals for it.

22:09.363 --> 22:10.932
Get outta town, where is it?

22:10.932 --> 22:12.666
I used it to blackmail the city
just like I said I would.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.737
<i>Hey, y'all, it's me again.</i>
<i>This just in,</i>

22:14.737 --> 22:18.271
<i>we take you live to</i>
<i>a high-speed chase on</i>
<i>the abruptly renamed</i>

22:18.305 --> 22:19.606
<i>Harley Quinn Parkway.</i>

22:19.640 --> 22:21.942
I'll be fuckin' damned.
Totally worth it.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.510
Right?

22:23.544 --> 22:28.544
