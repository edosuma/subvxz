00:10.349 --> 00:12.071
<i>Previously on "The Arrangement"...</i>

00:12.683 --> 00:15.269
You want me to play the girl on your arm?

00:15.631 --> 00:16.905
So you can do what?

00:17.552 --> 00:19.006
What's your big secret?

00:19.890 --> 00:22.157
I just flat out lied
to the person that I love.

00:22.159 --> 00:23.158
And it was easy.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.339
Enjoying the job?

00:24.364 --> 00:25.630
Yeah, I've always loved movies.

00:26.036 --> 00:27.569
Ah, so you wanna be an actor?

00:27.571 --> 00:28.805
Recruiting Wes?

00:29.072 --> 00:31.106
Is this your attempt at punishing me?

00:31.108 --> 00:33.442
Murder-suicide
at the Institute of the Higher Mind?

00:33.444 --> 00:34.543
How much do you want?

00:34.545 --> 00:36.044
<i>It's not money I'm after.</i>

00:36.409 --> 00:39.014
You can tell your Mr.
Anderson the case is closed

00:39.258 --> 00:40.788
and the files are put away.

00:41.493 --> 00:44.127
I can't watch Terence control Kyle anymore.

00:44.129 --> 00:45.429
I'm ready to meet your friends.

00:45.431 --> 00:46.897
Make sure you pack the burner phone.

00:46.899 --> 00:49.306
Ten years ago, a girl named Julie Woolth

00:49.410 --> 00:50.633
joined IHM.

00:50.636 --> 00:52.536
Terence told her they were
gonna make her an icon.

00:52.865 --> 00:54.985
And then she just vanished.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.933
It should be in the IHM system.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.136
<i>It's the last thing I'm
gonna ask you to do.</i>

00:59.138 --> 01:00.196
<i>I promise.</i>

01:04.282 --> 01:07.116
<i>According to sources,
the Kygan wedding could happen</i>

01:07.118 --> 01:09.618
<i>any day now, but guests
who have been given</i>

01:09.620 --> 01:12.521
<i>the exact date and
location have also signed</i>

01:12.523 --> 01:15.124
<i>a non-disclosure agreement
to make sure the details</i>

01:15.126 --> 01:17.059
<i>stay out of the hands of the press.</i>

01:24.228 --> 01:25.702

01:31.093 --> 01:32.161
Hi.

01:32.568 --> 01:33.576
Thank you.

01:55.064 --> 01:56.096
Two more weeks.

01:56.098 --> 01:57.598
Or we could just go back upstairs

01:57.600 --> 01:58.609
and get married right now.

01:58.609 --> 02:00.342
A municipal wedding. How romantic.

02:00.344 --> 02:02.244
Ah, no guest lists, no press.

02:03.481 --> 02:04.849
There'd be riots in the street.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.532
I know.

02:07.343 --> 02:09.029
- Mr. West.
- Yes, sir?

02:09.395 --> 02:11.487
I don't usually violate procedure, but...

02:12.771 --> 02:14.304
Can I bother you for a photo?

02:15.407 --> 02:16.778
Today's my wife's birthday.

02:17.206 --> 02:18.675
Screw a photo. Let's get a video, huh?

02:18.677 --> 02:19.976
- What's her name?
- Amanda.

02:19.978 --> 02:20.956
Amanda.

02:21.647 --> 02:23.079
Shaun texted me.

02:23.081 --> 02:24.447
She wants to talk.

02:24.693 --> 02:26.049
Maybe my pep talk worked.

02:26.268 --> 02:27.617
You talked to her?

02:27.754 --> 02:29.547
I went to see her at IHM
when you were out of town.

02:29.599 --> 02:32.585
You can't do stuff like
that without talking to me.

02:32.802 --> 02:33.934
It's risky.

02:33.934 --> 02:35.099
Well, I did.

02:35.101 --> 02:36.234
Now she wants to talk, so...

02:36.582 --> 02:37.769
- Thank you.
- You got it.

02:48.784 --> 02:51.083
Kyle West, as I live and breathe.

02:51.394 --> 02:52.860
What brings you to the courthouse?

02:56.633 --> 02:57.774
Marriage license?

02:58.080 --> 02:59.179
What do you want?

02:59.181 --> 03:00.380
I have a deposition.

03:00.382 --> 03:01.948
Gang members. Dead witnesses.

03:01.950 --> 03:02.984
Fun stuff.

03:03.977 --> 03:06.052
Not the most fun I've
had on the job, though.

03:06.343 --> 03:07.843
My fiancée's here.

03:07.845 --> 03:09.111
Don't screw this up for me.

03:13.117 --> 03:14.816
Detective Natalie Gaffey.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.911
Hi. You two know each other?

03:18.703 --> 03:19.836
Just from the movies.

03:22.207 --> 03:24.674
Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.

03:24.676 --> 03:26.285
It was nice to meet you, Detective.

03:26.879 --> 03:27.981
You, too.

03:28.844 --> 03:30.081
You're a lucky girl.

03:44.227 --> 03:46.343
Can I have your autograph, Megan?

03:46.929 --> 03:49.463
Kyle! Can I have your autograph?

03:49.465 --> 03:50.512
Hi.

Synced and corrected by louvette
www.addic7ed.com

04:07.542 --> 04:09.480
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:10.912 --> 04:12.420
- Wanna walk?
- Yeah.

04:15.083 --> 04:18.166
So, what's this about?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.108
Julie Woolth.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.667
- I found her.
- Where is she?

04:24.399 --> 04:25.698
Greenfield.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.753
It's up the coast about four hours.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.263
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

04:30.769 --> 04:32.718
I have to see her before the wedding.

04:32.871 --> 04:34.937
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

04:34.939 --> 04:36.439
If I have a chance to get Terence

04:36.441 --> 04:38.107
out of the picture by then...

04:39.477 --> 04:41.110
Megan, I wanna go with you.

04:43.468 --> 04:46.534
- Thank you.
- It might take a couple days,

04:46.591 --> 04:48.516
but how do you think we can sneak away?

04:49.101 --> 04:50.168
Greenfield.

04:51.431 --> 04:52.708
What is that near?

04:52.733 --> 04:55.199
It's about an hour from Paso Robles.

04:55.369 --> 04:56.602
Wine country.

04:57.604 --> 04:58.737
That'll work.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.205
Work for what?

05:00.904 --> 05:03.108
The bachelorette party
you're gonna throw me.

05:05.538 --> 05:06.478
Hmm.

05:06.842 --> 05:08.380
Paso Robles is nice.

05:08.859 --> 05:10.225
Are you sure you don't wanna do Vegas?

05:10.227 --> 05:12.327
Take the jet? Suite at the Metropolitan?

05:12.329 --> 05:13.762
Yeah? You deserve to do it right.

05:13.764 --> 05:15.121
Honestly, I just...

05:15.532 --> 05:18.333
I wanna kick back with my girls
and a couple bottles of merlot

05:18.335 --> 05:20.802
and Vegas will be a zoo.

05:20.804 --> 05:22.704
- I don't need the craziness.
- Yeah.

05:27.001 --> 05:28.768
Uh, are we gonna do "Ellen"?

05:29.249 --> 05:30.612
The day before the wedding?

05:30.920 --> 05:32.920
Well, they need an answer.

05:32.922 --> 05:34.514
I think no, right?

05:35.058 --> 05:37.158
Yeah, at some point, people are probably

05:37.161 --> 05:38.661
gonna start getting sick of us.

05:38.749 --> 05:39.874
Not me.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.369
Did something happen today?

05:49.240 --> 05:51.340
No. No, why?

05:51.569 --> 05:53.603
Well, you seem a little down.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.004
No, I don't know.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.739
Maybe I seem down 'cause
you're a little up.

05:56.741 --> 05:57.970
A little?

05:58.548 --> 06:01.465
In two weeks I am marrying
the love of my life.

06:02.247 --> 06:04.013
I am way up.

06:52.549 --> 06:54.082
_

06:58.309 --> 07:00.717
Babe. Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe.

07:00.742 --> 07:02.590
It's okay. Kyle.

07:07.548 --> 07:09.053
Someone was trying to kill me.

07:09.524 --> 07:11.001
It was just a dream.

07:11.783 --> 07:12.815
It's okay.

07:28.401 --> 07:29.432
So?

07:31.162 --> 07:32.214
Nada.

07:33.865 --> 07:35.007
So we'll try again.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.505
Barely even started.

07:37.869 --> 07:39.202
I know you're disappointed.

07:39.204 --> 07:41.200
- I'm not.
- You are.

07:42.312 --> 07:44.240
You're just better at hiding it than I am.

07:46.644 --> 07:48.277
Maybe we do IVF.

07:48.505 --> 07:51.429
I mean, you are nobody in this
town unless you have twins.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.817
What if we could go back to
the beginning and start over?

07:56.533 --> 07:59.121
I'm not gonna be a guinea
pig in Isaac's science project.

08:00.877 --> 08:02.164
I meant Wes.

08:05.082 --> 08:06.616
You know he wants to act, right?

08:07.140 --> 08:08.273
Since when?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.780
He's got a ton of untapped potential.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.382
We did a reading. There's
a deep loss inside him.

08:13.384 --> 08:15.785
With the right coaching,
he could be groomed to...

08:15.787 --> 08:17.753
- Groomed for what?
- For a career.

08:17.963 --> 08:18.998
A big one.

08:19.057 --> 08:20.122
With my coaching, your connections,

08:20.124 --> 08:21.824
his looks, his diversity,

08:21.826 --> 08:23.993
someone like Wes is gonna be
the future of this business.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.980
I thought I made it very
clear what the boundaries

08:26.982 --> 08:28.081
should be with Wes.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.570
I didn't approach him.

08:29.652 --> 08:30.918
He came to me.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.285
He wants this, DeAnn.

08:32.288 --> 08:33.330
Okay.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.789
Well, assuming that I believe you,

08:35.991 --> 08:38.388
that still doesn't make him our child.

08:38.847 --> 08:40.294
I never said it did.

08:40.808 --> 08:43.125
Do you remember how this
whole conversation started?

08:43.980 --> 08:45.499
Look, he's got no one else.

08:45.911 --> 08:48.414
So he can either drift through life, lost,

08:48.480 --> 08:50.080
or we can give him a future.

08:50.082 --> 08:51.695
Why wouldn't you want that for him?

09:00.951 --> 09:02.784
Oh, it's good to see you're packing light.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.134
There will be many wardrobe changes,

09:05.136 --> 09:06.910
all drunkenly documented.

09:07.272 --> 09:09.038
You know what I was thinking?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.673
Maybe you should take security.

09:11.014 --> 09:12.299
At least one guy.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.306
To spy on us?

09:14.713 --> 09:16.346
You can say it.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.647
To protect you, all right?

09:17.649 --> 09:19.282
To give you some privacy.

09:19.284 --> 09:20.917
In Paso Robles?

09:20.919 --> 09:23.252
The entire world knows
that beautiful face by now.

09:23.652 --> 09:24.987
I'll handle it.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.189
If anyone bothers us,
we'll go back up to the room

09:27.192 --> 09:28.925
and party. I promise.

09:29.315 --> 09:32.027
- And call me.
- I will blow up your phone.

09:37.354 --> 09:39.756
But I don't love leaving you right now.

09:40.024 --> 09:41.590
Why, because I had a bad dream?

09:41.592 --> 09:43.058
No, you woke up screaming.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.860
I was screaming in the dream, all right?

09:44.862 --> 09:46.360
It wasn't about anything real.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.530
Oh, yeah!

09:48.972 --> 09:51.217
I have a little something,

09:51.242 --> 09:53.375
and it is not optional.

09:53.377 --> 09:54.943
- Oh.
- What?

09:54.945 --> 09:57.045
My God, this is happening!

09:57.047 --> 09:58.046
Oh, yes.

09:59.883 --> 10:02.217
Well, if you drink enough,
you won't even know it's there.

10:02.219 --> 10:04.719
Oh, I guess you've been
to a bachelorette party?

10:04.721 --> 10:05.987
Uh, I did a movie about one.

10:05.989 --> 10:08.890
Oh, we remember. Hot Guy Number 1.

10:08.892 --> 10:10.525
My name was Vance.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.135
All right?

10:12.997 --> 10:14.363
Tessa's flight gets in at 3:00.

10:14.365 --> 10:15.688
She'll meet you at the hotel.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.233
Please give Tessa my love.

10:17.235 --> 10:18.280
She's great.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.802
Mmm, can't wait to meet her.

10:19.804 --> 10:22.104
Let's get this party started!

10:22.106 --> 10:23.200
Whoo!

10:26.844 --> 10:28.344
Look, do not tell Tessa.

10:28.346 --> 10:29.979
The fewer people who know, the better.

10:29.981 --> 10:31.647
All right, we'll go with your cover story.

10:31.649 --> 10:34.137
But I'm telling you,
she's gonna figure it out.

10:34.162 --> 10:36.218
We grew up together.
She could read my mind.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.089
I'm more concerned about
getting Julie to talk.

10:39.676 --> 10:41.142
According to Gail, Terence has her

10:41.144 --> 10:42.777
completely terrified,

10:42.779 --> 10:45.113
and if we can figure out why
and convince her to go public...

10:45.115 --> 10:46.381
Wh... And then what?

10:46.383 --> 10:48.783
Terence goes down? IHM goes down?

10:48.785 --> 10:50.685
Yeah, I'm open to all of it.

10:56.183 --> 10:57.850
Hi, checking in.

10:57.852 --> 10:58.951
Dimera, Sydney.

10:58.953 --> 11:00.519
Ah, thank you, Miss Dimera.

11:00.814 --> 11:02.113
We have you for two nights

11:02.115 --> 11:03.348
in one of our mountain view suites.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.088
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:07.679 --> 11:11.558
Look, just to be completely up front,

11:12.981 --> 11:16.094
I'm not here because I
want to destroy Terence.

11:16.363 --> 11:17.929
I'm not back on board with that.

11:18.290 --> 11:19.741
Then why'd you come?

11:19.825 --> 11:23.093
Because I need to know if
what you say about Terence

11:23.095 --> 11:25.596
is true, beyond just your story.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.064
That's fine.

11:27.066 --> 11:29.433
But just promise me that
when we find something,

11:29.435 --> 11:31.068
you'll be ready to act.

11:31.070 --> 11:32.135
Thanks.

11:32.137 --> 11:33.591
- Thank you.
- Hi.

11:33.939 --> 11:36.306
If we find something.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.670
Oh, it's on!

11:46.672 --> 11:48.272
- Tessa!
- Hey!

11:48.274 --> 11:49.940
Hey yourself. This place is amazing.

11:49.942 --> 11:50.941
Right?

11:50.943 --> 11:53.143
- You look great.
- Mmm.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.712
Hi, I'm Shaun. I'm...

11:54.714 --> 11:56.146
- Oh!
- Oh, okay.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.781
Yep, I'm a hugger.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.817
Or maybe I'm just really
excited to get away from Brian.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.351
Why? What's the matter?

12:01.353 --> 12:03.320
He tried to put up a
shelf in the baby's room.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.756
It looks like he sprayed
the wall with a nail gun.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.091
When can we drink?

12:07.634 --> 12:09.588
Well, I have to take it easy tonight.

12:09.613 --> 12:10.913
I have a meeting in the morning.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.096
Ugh, why?

12:12.461 --> 12:13.893
I'm promoting a new wine brand,

12:13.895 --> 12:15.395
so we need to go downtown tomorrow

12:15.397 --> 12:16.810
and sign the contract.

12:17.349 --> 12:19.660
You can't sign your name hung over?

12:19.814 --> 12:21.864
No, I have to review everything first.

12:21.889 --> 12:25.190
But I am treating you to
a fabulous hot stone massage

12:25.192 --> 12:26.191
at the spa.

12:28.029 --> 12:29.906
- No.
- Hmm?

12:31.555 --> 12:33.995
You're gonna cut the shit
and tell me what's going on.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.760
Are you having an affair?

12:36.455 --> 12:38.904
No! No, no.

12:38.906 --> 12:40.105
Are you sure?

12:40.107 --> 12:41.708
I smell subterfuge.

12:46.859 --> 12:49.091
Well, it's... it's
interesting, 'cause in the dream

12:49.116 --> 12:50.928
you're fast asleep and
completely vulnerable

12:50.988 --> 12:52.687
yet the intruder never
laid a finger on you.

12:52.712 --> 12:54.612
Just bolts right out of the room, yeah.

12:54.614 --> 12:56.748
And the minute you followed
them to find out who they are...

12:56.750 --> 12:58.464
She goes all Norman Bates on me.

12:58.752 --> 13:01.093
- She?
- It's obviously Gaffey.

13:01.988 --> 13:03.621
I mean, come on. It can't be a coincidence.

13:03.623 --> 13:05.323
Okay, I see her, then the dream.

13:05.587 --> 13:06.892
Well, maybe.

13:06.893 --> 13:09.393
But also the fact that he or
she stabbed you in the heart

13:09.395 --> 13:11.028
with a knife could mean
that you're feeling betrayed

13:11.030 --> 13:12.463
by someone close to you.

13:13.695 --> 13:15.293
Either that, or the killer is you.

13:19.806 --> 13:21.472
So, what?

13:21.474 --> 13:23.674
I won't let myself feel
happiness because I don't think

13:23.676 --> 13:25.129
that I deserve it?

13:25.278 --> 13:26.978
Hey, if someone from
your past won't destroy you,

13:26.980 --> 13:28.453
you'll do it yourself.

13:33.611 --> 13:36.301
And that's why your
foundation has to be strong.

13:36.364 --> 13:38.264
So the next time you run
into someone like Gaffey,

13:38.266 --> 13:40.128
you're capable of dealing with it.

13:40.268 --> 13:41.601
I literally haven't been that scared

13:41.603 --> 13:42.836
since "The Nightmare on Elm Street"

13:42.838 --> 13:43.974
when I was eight years old.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.672
Look, here's what I want you to do.

13:47.674 --> 13:49.807
Instead of remembering
the house the way it was

13:49.809 --> 13:50.961
in the dream,

13:50.961 --> 13:52.372
just make it what you want it to be.

13:52.397 --> 13:53.416
How?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.831
Buy new furniture.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.524
Throw up some art. Whatever.

13:56.525 --> 13:58.058
And when Megan leaves for a few hours...

13:58.060 --> 14:00.093
Well, she's gone now.
It's her bachelorette party.

14:00.095 --> 14:01.461
Well, that's perfect.

14:01.463 --> 14:03.330
And then I want you to take a sketch pad

14:03.788 --> 14:05.576
and draw a picture of the thing

14:05.934 --> 14:07.801
that you are the most afraid of.

14:09.448 --> 14:10.765
And I want you to burn it.

14:17.720 --> 14:18.863
So, we good?

14:19.941 --> 14:23.057
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

14:23.721 --> 14:24.853
Come in.

14:27.262 --> 14:29.659
Sorry, just here for my session.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.006
What kind of session?

14:33.506 --> 14:35.290
Um, acting.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.107
Oh, I didn't know you were teaching him.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.168
I am.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.279
How's "Technicolor Highway" looking?

14:42.047 --> 14:44.018
Good. Yeah, good.

14:45.851 --> 14:46.817
Yeah.

14:52.648 --> 14:53.814
Let's get started.

14:58.913 --> 15:01.054
Big house. She's doing okay.

15:01.516 --> 15:03.149
Mm-hmm. She's in real estate,

15:03.151 --> 15:04.697
but this is subsidized.

15:04.986 --> 15:06.652
I found a paper trail.

15:06.654 --> 15:09.021
IHM has been making monthly payments

15:09.023 --> 15:10.709
to a shell corporation.

15:11.526 --> 15:13.960
The shell corporation leads to Julie.

15:14.395 --> 15:17.230
So he's been buying her silence for years?

15:17.232 --> 15:18.504
Maybe.

15:20.235 --> 15:22.001
I feel like my brain is about to explode.

15:22.003 --> 15:23.677
I can't believe this is even real.

15:23.702 --> 15:25.702
Yeah, welcome to the last year of my life.

15:25.704 --> 15:27.959
So even after all that insanity,

15:28.374 --> 15:30.145
you still love Kyle, right?

15:30.409 --> 15:32.253
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't.

15:32.878 --> 15:34.711
Well, this is way more interesting

15:34.713 --> 15:35.979
than a regular bachelorette party.

15:35.981 --> 15:37.514
I am so sorry.

15:37.516 --> 15:39.383
I should have told you
this before you flew out.

15:39.385 --> 15:41.163
Wait, no, this is her.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.357
Should we go say hello?

15:47.359 --> 15:48.692
No, I can't just run up to her

15:48.694 --> 15:50.294
when she's getting in her car.

15:50.468 --> 15:52.434
If she recognizes me and ties me to IHM,

15:52.436 --> 15:53.502
she'll freak out.

15:53.504 --> 15:55.004
We'll never get her to talk.

15:55.006 --> 15:57.435
And she's the one person
that could actually help us.

15:57.713 --> 16:00.247
No, we need to create
a more natural meeting.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.331
Ease her in. Make her feel comfortable.

16:02.331 --> 16:03.426
Exactly.

16:06.414 --> 16:08.614
I think one of us should go house shopping.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.303
All smart appliances that you can turn on

16:13.305 --> 16:14.438
with an app.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.473
I love this house.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.404
Yeah, why are they selling?

16:18.510 --> 16:20.477
The husband transferred to Reno.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.799
So they are highly motivated.

16:23.194 --> 16:25.220
Are you interested in making an offer?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.349
Well...

16:27.486 --> 16:29.774
I want my other friend to see it.

16:30.486 --> 16:31.685
She's on her way.

16:31.687 --> 16:33.477
I'm here. Sorry.

16:34.245 --> 16:36.035
Hi, I'm Megan.

16:36.922 --> 16:38.054
I know who you are.

16:40.202 --> 16:41.704
You're Megan Morrison.

16:43.599 --> 16:45.600
I love you.

16:45.901 --> 16:49.013
Oh, that... that's very sweet. Thank you.

16:49.305 --> 16:50.537
I'm sorry.

16:50.539 --> 16:53.140
I'm Julie. I know this is unprofessional,

16:53.142 --> 16:55.008
but please tell me those rumors

16:55.010 --> 16:57.271
about you and Xavier Hughes aren't true.

16:57.271 --> 16:58.922
Oh, I asked the same thing.

16:59.957 --> 17:01.744
I'm madly in love with Kyle.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.694
We're actually here for
her bachelorette party.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.646
And house shopping. For me.

17:08.647 --> 17:10.694
Oh, how fun.

17:12.786 --> 17:14.132
Kyle's great.

17:15.690 --> 17:18.490
I met him a couple times, actually.

17:18.492 --> 17:20.192
Back when I was at the Institute.

17:21.588 --> 17:23.111
You were at IHM?

17:24.128 --> 17:25.362
For a few years.

17:25.364 --> 17:27.814
I fell off when I moved here.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.200
Not that I didn't love it.

17:31.637 --> 17:34.820
I will always credit IHM
with changing my life.

17:36.909 --> 17:38.033
But, you know,

17:38.410 --> 17:40.967
you find new things.

17:41.742 --> 17:42.846
New purpose.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.560
But it was a good experience for you?

17:47.897 --> 17:49.961
And I made some great friends.

17:52.601 --> 17:54.423
So, tell me,

17:55.504 --> 17:58.705
is IHM still as wonderful as it was?

17:59.974 --> 18:01.414
It's even better.

18:12.330 --> 18:14.363
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:15.366 --> 18:17.833
Great. Sent.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.088
"Partying with my BFFs."

18:23.616 --> 18:25.827
I can't believe IHM checks your socials.

18:26.619 --> 18:29.553
Okay, isn't it time we just drop the ruse?

18:29.555 --> 18:30.721
I mean, Julie's happy.

18:30.723 --> 18:32.122
Yeah, she's too happy.

18:32.124 --> 18:33.123
Really, Megan?

18:33.172 --> 18:34.217
Trust me.

18:34.272 --> 18:35.829
I can tell when someone's acting.

18:35.995 --> 18:37.795
And she's way too enthusiastic.

18:37.797 --> 18:38.862
I don't buy it.

18:38.864 --> 18:40.998
Of course you don't buy
it. You have your agenda.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.599
And of course you buy it.

18:42.601 --> 18:44.034
You have your agenda.

18:44.036 --> 18:46.670
You wanna believe he's this great guy.

18:46.672 --> 18:47.897
You're right.

18:47.897 --> 18:48.957
He's my boss.

18:48.982 --> 18:51.005
You talk about your boss a lot.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.212
What do you think?

18:52.873 --> 18:55.461
I think I really like that house.

18:56.084 --> 18:58.718
Megan, you backed off because you knew

18:58.720 --> 19:00.487
you had the story wrong.

19:00.489 --> 19:02.288
No. I wasn't sure.

19:02.290 --> 19:04.591
But Julie is obviously in a good place,

19:04.593 --> 19:06.693
and maybe it's just time to accept that.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.196
Just accept that Terence
isn't going anywhere?

19:13.001 --> 19:14.051
Right.

19:15.036 --> 19:16.569
Tessa, say something.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.008
I'm torn.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.774
On one hand, Terence is obviously a dick.

19:20.776 --> 19:23.676
On the other hand,
you're living your dream.

19:23.678 --> 19:26.045
Hollywood. Bright lights.

19:26.047 --> 19:27.647
The wedding of the century.

19:27.649 --> 19:29.115
Work you believe in.

19:29.117 --> 19:30.350
A fiancé you love.

19:30.352 --> 19:32.204
Looks like a golden god.

19:32.576 --> 19:34.187
I do really love him.

19:34.397 --> 19:35.683
There you go.

19:36.057 --> 19:38.491
It is your bachelorette party.

19:38.883 --> 19:41.017
Hopefully the only one you'll ever have.

19:42.153 --> 19:44.987
It doesn't have to be
fake if you don't want it to.

19:44.989 --> 19:47.323
But it does have to be awesome.

20:36.463 --> 20:38.296
Okay.

20:46.172 --> 20:47.672
That was not my fault.

20:48.742 --> 20:49.807
Don't get married.

20:49.809 --> 20:51.075
Look what you'd be giving up.

20:51.077 --> 20:52.276
You're drunk.

20:52.278 --> 20:53.478
I know.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.846
I miss Brian.

20:54.848 --> 20:57.415
- Aww.
- Once you find the right guy,

20:57.417 --> 20:59.283
anything is forgivable.

20:59.285 --> 21:00.818
Even the shelf.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.819
Really?

21:01.821 --> 21:03.788
- No.
- The shelf is awful.

21:47.323 --> 21:50.268
<i>That you might live freely
and without fear.</i>

21:58.732 --> 22:02.641
<i>That you might
live freely and without fear.</i>

22:02.642 --> 22:05.910
<i>Someone's close to you</i>

22:05.912 --> 22:08.796
<i>- to kill you.
- The killer is you.</i>

22:09.749 --> 22:12.316
<i>- Or you are the killer.
- Or you are the killer.</i>

22:12.318 --> 22:14.286
<i>You'll do it yourself.</i>

22:14.687 --> 22:16.854
<i>Your foundation has to be strong.</i>

22:16.856 --> 22:19.190
<i>- But you're weak.
- But you're weak.</i>

22:19.488 --> 22:20.587
<i>Kyle.</i>

22:56.905 --> 22:58.791
So good.

23:04.012 --> 23:05.044
It's Zach.

23:06.327 --> 23:08.528
He wants an update. What do I tell him?

23:21.910 --> 23:23.629
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

23:24.145 --> 23:25.478
Just trying to call my dad.

23:25.762 --> 23:26.946
Oh, cool.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.614
I'm just gonna light some shit on fire.

23:28.860 --> 23:30.170
- Right on.
- Yeah.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.051
<i>Where have you been?</i>

23:41.076 --> 23:42.434
<i>You were supposed to
meet Julie hours ago.</i>

23:42.434 --> 23:44.981
- We did.
- It didn't work.

23:45.286 --> 23:46.708
You're kidding.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.254
But the money. What'd
she say about the money?

23:49.256 --> 23:51.121
<i>It didn't feel right to ask.</i>

23:51.510 --> 23:53.610
She brought up IHM on her own,

23:53.612 --> 23:56.309
and she seems to really like Terence.

23:56.715 --> 23:58.772
- She's lying. <i>
- Zach, you weren't there.</i>

23:58.772 --> 24:00.171
That's her story.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.639
Well, you need to go
back and get the real one.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.241
<i>We can't just go back.</i>

24:03.243 --> 24:05.743
If Julie tells Terence, then
this whole thing is done.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.812
It's done if you don't try.

24:08.206 --> 24:10.096
Yeah, well, at least
there's not a retention team

24:10.121 --> 24:11.460
<i>waiting to black bag me.</i>

24:11.739 --> 24:12.975
I know. I know you're worried.

24:12.977 --> 24:14.074
I get it.

24:14.074 --> 24:16.374
But you have to go back and
get Julie to talk to you.

24:16.910 --> 24:18.575
Dad, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

24:21.045 --> 24:22.113
Hello?

24:23.619 --> 24:25.052
Sorry, my dad.

24:25.054 --> 24:27.230
His physical therapist
keeps flaking on him.

24:27.523 --> 24:28.488
What's up?

24:30.759 --> 24:32.149
What did you tell him?

24:32.548 --> 24:34.594
He called me "Dad" and hung up.

24:37.399 --> 24:38.665
Who's Julie?

24:38.860 --> 24:40.426
His physical therapist. Why?

24:40.740 --> 24:42.516
You hung up as soon as you saw me.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.085
Because you needed something.

24:44.425 --> 24:45.763
Hmm. And you're using

24:45.763 --> 24:46.862
a burner phone.

24:48.365 --> 24:49.699
Zach, who's Julie?

24:52.037 --> 24:54.604
I already told you. Can I go now?

24:54.606 --> 24:56.124
Sure. Let me call him.

24:57.903 --> 24:58.859
Why?

24:58.884 --> 25:00.465
Give me the phone, Zach.

25:01.246 --> 25:02.508
Now.

25:06.989 --> 25:08.251
It's him.

25:18.505 --> 25:20.990
<i>Please leave a
message after the tone.</i>

25:42.867 --> 25:45.438
Hey, how'd you sleep?

25:46.180 --> 25:47.479
Not great.

25:47.481 --> 25:50.988
Uh, it was a crazy night.

25:51.408 --> 25:52.484
Another dream?

25:53.078 --> 25:54.252
<i>I wish.</i>

25:54.482 --> 25:57.155
I actually caught Zach talking
to somebody on a burner phone.

25:59.755 --> 26:00.921
That's crazy.

26:00.946 --> 26:02.594
Like, a secret conversation?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.337
<i>Yep.</i>

26:04.859 --> 26:06.826
Did he say who he was talking to?

26:07.272 --> 26:09.479
His dad, but I'm not buying it.

26:09.964 --> 26:11.464
<i>I actually called the number back,</i>

26:11.466 --> 26:12.765
<i>but nobody picked up.</i>

26:14.720 --> 26:17.104
That's creepy. Why would he lie?

26:17.145 --> 26:18.812
<i>Maybe he's the one selling stuff
to the press.</i>

26:18.814 --> 26:20.221
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:20.221 --> 26:22.354
All I do know is, is we're
gonna get some answers.

26:22.355 --> 26:23.746
Look, I gotta hit the road.

26:23.890 --> 26:25.223
Where you going?

26:28.428 --> 26:29.594
Kyle?

26:30.920 --> 26:32.276
<i>I'm going to the Facility.</i>

26:32.301 --> 26:34.450
<i>I called Terence. He
had Zach brought there.</i>

26:35.057 --> 26:36.318
The Facility?

26:36.458 --> 26:38.656
You know what Terence
is going to do to him.

26:38.794 --> 26:41.030
<i>Megan, as long as he tells us the truth,</i>

26:41.296 --> 26:42.729
<i>nothing's gonna happen to him.</i>

26:57.446 --> 26:59.713
Gotta tell you, Zach, I
hate seeing you like this.

27:03.486 --> 27:06.287
If this Facility doesn't help people,

27:06.289 --> 27:07.355
then why did you go?

27:07.357 --> 27:08.665
Tessa, please, I can't.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.241
I need to go back.

27:10.243 --> 27:11.958
I need to find out how much Terence knows.

27:12.279 --> 27:13.311
Okay, you're scaring me.

27:13.313 --> 27:14.679
Yeah, I'm scared, too.

27:14.681 --> 27:17.015
Because Zach will break and when he does,

27:17.017 --> 27:18.141
I'm finished.

27:18.318 --> 27:19.684
Terence will ruin everything.

27:19.686 --> 27:22.654
My marriage, my career, Shaun's, too.

27:22.656 --> 27:24.622
This whole thing is just
blowing up in our faces.

27:24.624 --> 27:26.958
You can't be 100% sure Zach's gonna break.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.893
Can't be 100% sure of anything.

27:31.264 --> 27:32.917
I think we should just go for it.

27:33.167 --> 27:34.518
Wait, what?

27:35.035 --> 27:36.668
We'll go back to Julie's,

27:36.670 --> 27:38.903
and I'll just lay all
of my cards on the table.

27:38.905 --> 27:40.171
N... No, no, no, no.

27:40.173 --> 27:41.506
This is just getting way out of control.

27:41.508 --> 27:44.339
- Yeah, I agree.
- Well, you wanted the truth, right?

27:44.478 --> 27:45.777
That's what we're doing.

27:45.779 --> 27:47.779
No, I think we're poking a bear.

27:47.781 --> 27:49.414
Well, I'll take that risk.

27:49.772 --> 27:51.636
I'm not going home without answers.

27:52.326 --> 27:53.818
And if you don't like them?

27:55.176 --> 27:56.668
Then I'll have to live with them.

28:04.653 --> 28:06.486
So, what looks good?

28:06.703 --> 28:08.803
Hmm.

28:08.805 --> 28:10.138
Mmm.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.607
Hi, can I interest you in any drinks?

28:12.609 --> 28:14.008
Wine, cocktails?

28:14.010 --> 28:15.810
Uh, yes. I will have the Justin cab,

28:15.812 --> 28:18.646
- and he...
- Doesn't drink anymore.

28:20.327 --> 28:21.583
Me, neither.

28:21.585 --> 28:23.126
Sparkling water, then?

28:23.854 --> 28:25.014
Sure.

28:25.388 --> 28:27.388
Okay. And the Justin cab.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.626
I'll be right back.

28:33.947 --> 28:35.680
Well, she made that pretty clear.

28:37.017 --> 28:38.127
Yeah.

28:38.986 --> 28:40.852
You say that like it happens all the time.

28:40.854 --> 28:42.334
Does it happen all the time?

28:44.333 --> 28:45.455
No.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.747
So that was you just playing it cool,

28:47.749 --> 28:49.787
or are you actually not interested?

28:50.785 --> 28:52.451
She's beautiful. I'm just...

28:52.453 --> 28:53.885
I'm not ready for anything serious.

28:55.947 --> 28:57.255
'Cause your mom died.

28:58.382 --> 29:01.975
Um, because I'd like to
have my shit together first.

29:02.986 --> 29:03.985
I get that.

29:05.622 --> 29:08.057
But you shouldn't wait for
the perfect moment, either.

29:09.157 --> 29:11.357
Is it a good time to
tell you that you sound

29:11.360 --> 29:12.793
like my mom right now?

29:12.793 --> 29:14.059
I don't know.

29:15.695 --> 29:17.301
But I'm gonna do it again.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.629
Why didn't you tell me
you wanted to be an actor?

29:26.086 --> 29:27.519
I wanted to tell you.

29:27.521 --> 29:30.655
I just... I didn't want
to take advantage of you

29:30.657 --> 29:31.853
or your connections.

29:31.958 --> 29:33.512
Uh, you should.

29:33.927 --> 29:36.594
Eventually, yes, maybe.

29:36.839 --> 29:39.106
But first I wanna become a good actor

29:39.108 --> 29:40.307
like Terence is teaching me.

29:41.911 --> 29:42.975
Okay.

29:43.469 --> 29:46.904
I mean, listen, Terence is
a... He's an amazing teacher,

29:46.906 --> 29:48.779
in acting, in life.

29:49.806 --> 29:50.782
But?

29:51.806 --> 29:54.676
His time comes with strings attached.

29:55.378 --> 29:57.411
You have to operate on his schedule.

29:57.413 --> 29:59.113
And from what I hear,

29:59.115 --> 30:01.115
you're too talented to wait.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.987
Sometimes you're ready
when the moment arrives.

30:12.962 --> 30:14.250
What is this?

30:14.430 --> 30:15.765
A role.

30:16.558 --> 30:17.994
DeAnn...

30:18.019 --> 30:20.086
It's small, but it could be memorable.

30:20.111 --> 30:21.344
It's a great place to start.

30:21.386 --> 30:22.897
It's something to build on.

30:23.601 --> 30:25.355
And isn't that what you need?

30:26.137 --> 30:29.468
Justin cab and sparkling water.

30:31.209 --> 30:32.482
Thank you.

30:34.278 --> 30:35.916
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:36.681 --> 30:38.013
I know you don't wanna be here.

30:38.015 --> 30:39.548
I don't want you here, either.

30:39.550 --> 30:41.720
The way out that door is
by telling me the truth.

30:42.534 --> 30:44.467
Who were you talking to?

30:54.579 --> 30:55.840
W-Wait.

30:57.015 --> 30:58.545
I started using again.

30:58.983 --> 30:59.982
A little.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.052
I didn't want Kyle to know.

31:03.564 --> 31:05.472
Who were you talking to?

31:08.974 --> 31:10.374
Hudson.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.741
I was talking to Hudson.

31:13.396 --> 31:15.237
He didn't do anything wrong.

31:15.513 --> 31:17.742
I've had these micro relapses in the past.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.265
And he's been there for me.

31:22.077 --> 31:23.977
If he just talked to Julie like I asked,

31:23.979 --> 31:25.328
I wouldn't be here.

31:26.401 --> 31:27.566
But maybe it's better this way.

31:27.568 --> 31:28.627
I don't know.

31:29.466 --> 31:31.997
In here, at least I'm... I'm clean.

31:33.539 --> 31:35.541
So Julie, she's your drug dealer?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.619
Yes, but I didn't know how to find her.

31:38.743 --> 31:40.013
Hudson does.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.476
She's on his list of
places to check if I...

31:45.983 --> 31:47.496
If I really fall off the wagon.

31:53.857 --> 31:54.990
Okay.

31:59.107 --> 32:00.095
<i>You buy it?</i>

32:00.097 --> 32:01.930
<i>Draw some blood.</i>

32:01.932 --> 32:03.131
<i>Test him for drugs.</i>

32:03.133 --> 32:04.132
<i>We'll see if he's clean.</i>

32:24.031 --> 32:25.130
What'd he say?

32:25.132 --> 32:26.490
That he relapsed

32:26.515 --> 32:27.823
and was trying to score.

32:28.567 --> 32:30.345
He told me something completely different.

32:30.543 --> 32:32.138
What's his explanation for Julie?

32:32.138 --> 32:33.412
His drug dealer.

32:35.172 --> 32:36.374
Julie.

32:36.634 --> 32:39.301
Please tell me that name
is just a coincidence.

32:39.303 --> 32:40.843
Well, we'll know soon enough.

32:41.372 --> 32:42.671
I really didn't press that hard.

32:42.673 --> 32:44.458
Don't. Let me talk to him first.

32:45.042 --> 32:46.057
Okay.

32:46.082 --> 32:48.336
And remember, until we know
otherwise, he's the enemy.

32:48.336 --> 32:49.614
Yeah, don't worry.

32:49.757 --> 32:51.510
He's not getting any slack from me.

32:55.211 --> 32:57.457
So, who's the other Julie?

32:59.048 --> 33:00.320
A liability.

33:01.081 --> 33:02.837
That you're gonna deal with, right?

33:04.818 --> 33:06.484
I'm hitched to your wagon, Terence.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.187
She's a liability to you,
she's a liability to me.

33:09.310 --> 33:10.895
And I can't risk losing all my work.

33:10.934 --> 33:12.089
Our work.

33:13.837 --> 33:15.269
Just watch your blind spots.

33:15.271 --> 33:17.138
Could roll out Phase 1 by next year.

33:17.140 --> 33:18.606
Do me a favor, Isaac.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.166
Try showing me the same
confidence I show you.

33:33.425 --> 33:35.023
Don't look at me like that.

33:35.407 --> 33:36.586
Like what?

33:37.127 --> 33:38.292
Like I'm a stranger.

33:40.635 --> 33:41.799
Why not?

33:42.438 --> 33:44.032
It's not like I recognize you.

33:44.527 --> 33:45.926
Whatever you're up to,

33:45.928 --> 33:48.095
Terence doesn't believe your relapse story

33:48.097 --> 33:49.328
any more than I do.

33:50.366 --> 33:51.909
You wanna help yourself?

33:52.290 --> 33:53.580
Tell the truth.

33:55.095 --> 33:57.604
Whatever you're doing can't
be as bad as you think.

33:57.606 --> 33:59.239
I was being honest.

33:59.554 --> 34:01.475
You guys are just being paranoid.

34:13.976 --> 34:16.540
Dude, he's not gonna stop
until he gets the truth.

34:18.228 --> 34:20.152
I don't wanna see that happen to you.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.371
Then get me outta here.

34:22.801 --> 34:24.190
Just let me go.

34:25.949 --> 34:27.228
You'll never see me again.

34:35.710 --> 34:37.675
He will find you wherever you go.

34:41.070 --> 34:42.096
Fine.

34:47.340 --> 34:49.239
Just keep him away from Megan.

35:06.119 --> 35:07.785
You must really want that house.

35:07.787 --> 35:09.727
Julie, we need to talk.

35:09.727 --> 35:10.959
Is it about buying a house?

35:10.961 --> 35:13.662
No, it's about protecting people.

35:13.831 --> 35:16.365
I know Terence sent you money
through a shell corporation.

35:16.529 --> 35:17.854
I'd like to know why.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.496
I have no clue what you're talking about.

35:19.498 --> 35:20.831
I've seen the statements.

35:20.833 --> 35:21.982
It's how we found you.

35:22.007 --> 35:23.200
You need to leave.

35:23.202 --> 35:24.368
Please, you know him.

35:24.370 --> 35:25.736
He's gonna keep hurting people.

35:25.738 --> 35:27.171
Like he's hurt me, you...

35:27.173 --> 35:31.008
Just tell him that I
passed his little test.

35:31.010 --> 35:32.009
No, he didn't send me.

35:32.011 --> 35:33.077
Julie.

35:35.639 --> 35:36.780
Let them stay.

35:38.797 --> 35:39.850
Who are you?

35:41.015 --> 35:42.219
I'm her brother.

35:42.843 --> 35:43.908
Aaron.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.708
Don't tell these people a thing.

35:45.818 --> 35:47.451
We haven't even heard
what they have to say.

35:47.453 --> 35:48.566
I've heard enough.

35:48.566 --> 35:50.366
She will go public with anything you say.

35:50.368 --> 35:51.433
Tell me I'm wrong.

35:51.435 --> 35:52.835
You're right.

35:52.837 --> 35:55.070
But I promise I will
take whatever media heat

35:55.072 --> 35:57.272
comes our way, but I can't expose Terence

35:57.274 --> 35:58.507
without your story.

35:58.509 --> 36:00.562
Aaron? Think about what you lose.

36:00.587 --> 36:01.626
What?

36:01.978 --> 36:03.311
This place is a prison.

36:03.457 --> 36:04.975
The money's for you?

36:06.026 --> 36:07.232
Yeah.

36:07.327 --> 36:09.861
And my sister, she takes care of me.

36:10.150 --> 36:12.163
Which is why I have to
tell Terence they're here.

36:12.165 --> 36:13.370
Then do it.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.700
But you're... but you're
not protecting your brother.

36:15.702 --> 36:17.102
You're protecting Terence.

36:17.424 --> 36:19.070
Jules, I know you're
worried about the money,

36:19.072 --> 36:20.338
but it's been ten years,

36:20.340 --> 36:21.814
and they just show up at our door?

36:21.839 --> 36:23.341
This isn't divine intervention.

36:23.343 --> 36:24.808
They can't protect you.

36:24.844 --> 36:26.077
That's exactly what I'll do.

36:26.079 --> 36:27.145
You say that now.

36:27.147 --> 36:28.825
I've known Megan for years.

36:28.889 --> 36:30.181
When she says she's gonna do something,

36:30.183 --> 36:31.383
she'll do it.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.682
We need to know the truth.

36:34.310 --> 36:35.520
And I need to tell it.

36:44.271 --> 36:45.773
The payments are hush money.

36:46.698 --> 36:49.298
For this, the loss of my legs,

36:49.299 --> 36:50.617
among other things.

36:51.234 --> 36:52.843
Terence did this to you?

36:53.570 --> 36:54.640
Terence?

36:55.862 --> 36:56.938
No.

36:57.285 --> 36:58.442
Then who?

37:05.148 --> 37:07.949
Yeah, your fiancé. Kyle West.

37:10.335 --> 37:11.473
Why would...

37:12.792 --> 37:14.171
Why would he do this?

37:14.627 --> 37:16.314
Maybe it's just who he is.

37:17.047 --> 37:18.220
No.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.431
No.

37:24.980 --> 37:26.648
No, Kyle's a good person.

37:27.365 --> 37:29.566
In some ways, I'm sure that's true.

37:31.937 --> 37:33.036
What happened?

37:36.067 --> 37:37.906
We were in Terence's acting class together.

37:38.421 --> 37:39.514
Friends.

37:40.056 --> 37:41.805
And rivals.

37:42.699 --> 37:44.265
We go out for the same part.

37:44.267 --> 37:45.561
Kyle would get one.

37:45.669 --> 37:47.048
I would get one.

37:47.304 --> 37:48.799
We were competitive.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.406
And Kyle just couldn't handle losing.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.918
This was over some part?

37:55.816 --> 37:57.671
Do you remember the movie
that put Kyle on the map?

38:00.721 --> 38:02.049
I got that part.

38:02.723 --> 38:04.156
It was mine first.

38:04.353 --> 38:08.207
So we all went out to some dive on Vermont.

38:08.858 --> 38:10.229
To celebrate.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.331
And we partied.

38:12.631 --> 38:13.920
And we talked shit.

38:14.708 --> 38:16.775
And we were walking to
the car, and I, uh...

38:18.278 --> 38:19.419
I tell Kyle

38:20.147 --> 38:22.453
that I was gonna try to
get him a role in the movie.

38:22.716 --> 38:24.301
Featured extra.

38:24.910 --> 38:26.136
And he snapped.

38:26.918 --> 38:28.150
I knew how he was.

38:28.150 --> 38:29.395
I'd seen him fight before.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.797
But this was different.

38:32.253 --> 38:34.241
I didn't stand a chance when he came at me.

38:35.989 --> 38:37.688
He hit me in the back of the head, and...

38:40.728 --> 38:41.996
It was a trip.

38:43.519 --> 38:45.785
One minute, you're a fully
functioning human being,

38:45.787 --> 38:49.083
and the next, you wake
up in a hospital room.

38:49.782 --> 38:53.525
With a doctor who's asking you
if you can wiggle your toes.

38:55.888 --> 38:57.251
Just from one punch?

38:58.435 --> 38:59.547
No.

39:00.704 --> 39:02.021
That's just what I remember.

39:02.706 --> 39:03.972
Did you call the police?

39:03.974 --> 39:05.956
Of course. They took a report.

39:06.665 --> 39:08.264
But Terence covered it up.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.990
He buried the police
report and bought us off.

39:12.236 --> 39:13.644
We didn't have a choice.

39:14.232 --> 39:16.833
He made it very clear that
we should take the money

39:16.835 --> 39:18.521
and never come back to L.A.

39:19.267 --> 39:20.833
That was our arrangement.

39:22.921 --> 39:24.332
So now you know.

39:29.789 --> 39:31.211
What are you gonna do?

39:46.505 --> 39:47.524
I'll drive.

39:52.377 --> 39:55.639
Hey, you don't have to go home.

39:58.683 --> 39:59.824
You can come to New York.

39:59.849 --> 40:01.281
Stay as long as you want.

40:01.753 --> 40:03.004
No, I... I...

40:04.822 --> 40:05.922
I have to fig...

40:07.425 --> 40:08.824
I have to act like everything's normal

40:08.826 --> 40:10.726
until I figure out what to do next.

40:11.264 --> 40:12.295
Yeah.

40:23.007 --> 40:24.594
So, did you hear the good news?

40:24.959 --> 40:27.310
Wes scored a guest spot
on "Highland Falls."

40:27.547 --> 40:28.547
I did.

40:30.483 --> 40:32.748
And you know their casting
director, don't you?

40:35.932 --> 40:37.498
What do you want him to do? Pass?

40:37.777 --> 40:40.341
No, I didn't want him
submitted in the first place.

40:40.341 --> 40:42.107
And you're just upset
'cause he came to me first.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.244
No, I wanted to give him an opportunity,

40:44.246 --> 40:45.612
which is what he needs.

40:45.614 --> 40:46.802
He's not ready.

40:46.948 --> 40:48.278
Then coach him up.

40:50.444 --> 40:53.053
It's not like I'm phasing
you out of the process.

41:19.784 --> 41:20.942
Megan?

41:44.839 --> 41:46.102
You're home.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.333
Yep.

41:48.333 --> 41:49.802
I thought that maybe...

41:50.978 --> 41:52.002
Nevermind.

41:54.437 --> 41:55.608
I missed you.

42:23.566 --> 42:24.865
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:30.092 --> 42:31.659
You went to find Julie, didn't you?

42:33.362 --> 42:34.695
That's what the whole trip was about.

42:38.746 --> 42:39.899
What do you know?

42:43.093 --> 42:44.258
Everything.
