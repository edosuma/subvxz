HB
( theme music playing )

00:28.333 --> 00:31.100
MORNING!

00:31.200 --> 00:34.067
( birds twittering )

00:34.167 --> 00:37.733
- NEED SOME HELP?
- BE GREAT. THAT'D BE GREAT.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.800
OKAY.

00:44.933 --> 00:47.500
HEY, I'LL DO IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
RELAX.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.867
- I GOT IT.
- Mac: NICE, THANK YOU.

00:48.967 --> 00:51.333
- WHAT IS THIS, GRAPE JUICE?
- YES, GRAPE JUICE.

00:51.433 --> 00:54.200
- YOU GUYS DRINK GRAPE JUICE?
- SURE WE DO, IT'S A GREAT
ANTIOXIDANT.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.167
- COME ON OVER AND HAVE SOME.
- YOU NEVER SEE PEOPLE DRINKING
GRAPE JUICE.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.533
- IT'S DELICIOUS, YOU'D LOVE IT.
- I THINK IT'S A VERY
UNDERRATED JUICE.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.067
- IT IS!
- I WONDER WHY MORE
PEOPLE DON'T BUY IT.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.467
Ethel:
LARRY. LARRY.

01:05.567 --> 01:09.133
DID YOU KNOW THAT
A SEX OFFENDER MOVED
INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

01:09.233 --> 01:12.100
- YEAH, I SAW HIS
PICTURE ON A FLYER.
- I KNOW, IT'S TERRIBLE!

01:12.200 --> 01:14.200
YEAH, HE'S
A BALD GUY, TOO.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.267
- A BALD GUY.
- YEAH, A BALD GUY.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.600
- IT'S VERY BAD FOR
THE BALD COMMUNITY.
- OH, LARRY.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.733
WHAT'S VERY BAD FOR
THE COMMUNITY IS THAT
HE'S A SEX OFFENDER.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.267
I KNOW, AS LONG AS HE'S GONNA
BE A SEX OFFENDER I WISH HE
HAD A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.300
- OH, LARRY!
- LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.033
HAVE YOU-- HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN GETTING YOUR NEWSPAPER?

01:32.133 --> 01:33.667
YEAH, YEAH.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.400
- YOU HAVE?
- YES.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.867
HMM. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
MY PAPER IN SIX DAYS.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.433
I DID SEE SOMEBODY

01:39.533 --> 01:42.867
WALK UP YOUR
WALKWAY THERE,

01:42.967 --> 01:44.233
- PICK UP YOUR NEWSPAPER--
- WHAT?!

01:44.333 --> 01:46.733
BUT I FIGURED MAYBE IT
WAS SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNEW

01:46.833 --> 01:48.267
BECAUSE HE HAD ON A SUIT.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.733
A GUY IN A SUIT
IS TAKING MY PAPER?

01:50.833 --> 01:53.033
THAT'S WHY SHE THOUGHT IT
MIGHT YOUR FRIEND OF YOURS.

01:53.133 --> 01:55.767
JESUS!
THAT'S CRAZY!

01:55.867 --> 01:59.100
- Ethel: WELL, YOU KNOW.
- GUY IN A SUIT IS TAKING
MY NEWSPAPER?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.967
A SUIT'S A GOOD COVER IF
A GUY'S GONNA STEAL A PAPER.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.333
IF YOU SAW HIM AGAIN,
WOULD KNOW HIM?

02:04.433 --> 02:06.500
YEAH YEAH, I'M PRETTY
SURE I'D KNOW HIM.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.300
A GUY IN A SUIT?
HUH?

02:14.400 --> 02:17.167
- MAKES NO SENSE.
- STEALING PAPERS?

02:17.267 --> 02:20.033
- MAKES NO SENSE.
- I KNOW.

02:20.133 --> 02:21.767
I DON'T GET IT.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.967
I DON'T GET IT AT ALL.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.867
WHAT'S A MOTIVATION THERE?

02:25.967 --> 02:28.567
GUY IN A SUIT'S GOTTA
BE ABLE TO AFFORD A PAPER.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.200
YEAH. HEY, YOU COMING
TO PASSOVER SEDER?

02:31.300 --> 02:34.333
- CHERYL'S DOING A SEDER, HUH?
- YEAH, FOR MY FATHER.

02:34.433 --> 02:36.067
DOES SHE KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING?

02:36.167 --> 02:38.367
- I DON'T KNOW, SHE'LL FIND OUT.
- A LITTLE PROBLEM.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.333
SUSIE'S SISTER'S IN TOWN,

02:40.433 --> 02:44.000
WHICH MEANS MY
BROTHER-IN-LAW'S IN
TOWN WHICH MEANS THAT

02:44.100 --> 02:45.900
THEIR KID'S IN TOWN AND

02:46.000 --> 02:48.967
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW
IS A LITTLE...

02:49.067 --> 02:52.300
- HE'S A CONSERVATIVE?
- HE'S A CONSERVATIVE.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.467
- YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW'S
A CONSERVATIVE?
- BIG TIME.

02:54.567 --> 02:57.367
- BIG TIME CONSERVATIVE
- DO YOU WANT TO BRING
HIM TO THE SEDER?

02:57.467 --> 02:58.867
- YEAH.
- FINE, I DON'T CARE.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.433
- I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
- ALL RIGHT, VERY GOOD.

03:01.533 --> 03:04.433
- THANKS FOR LUNCH!
- SURE.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.567
Man:
THESE MACHINES
ARE REALLY FINICKY.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.467
YEAH, LET ME GIVE
YOU A HAND WITH THAT.

03:23.567 --> 03:25.333
NO NNO NO.

03:25.433 --> 03:27.733
- NO, LET ME HELP YOU OUT.
- NO, I DON'T EVEN CARE--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:27.833 --> 03:29.967
NO, LET ME GET THIS.
I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.
I'VE GOT THE TOUCH.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.900
- I DON'T EVEN NEED TO READ IT.
- WATCH WATCH WATCH WATCH.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
( coin jangling )

03:34.100 --> 03:36.400
I JUST KNOW HOW TO DO IT.
I KNOW THIS MACHINE.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.467
GO AHEAD.

03:39.867 --> 03:41.800
YOU WANT ONE?

03:41.900 --> 03:45.667
YEAH, BUT I'LL CLOSE IT
AGAIN AND PAY FOR IT,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.200
- IT'S JUST...
- OH. OKAY.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.567
( coin jangling )

03:52.400 --> 03:54.233
- OKAY, WELL...
- YEAH.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.900
- THANKS A LOT.
- HEY, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE--

03:58.000 --> 04:00.067
YOU'RE LARRY DAVID, RIGHT?

04:00.167 --> 04:03.700
- YEAH.
- YEAH, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU LIKE THIS.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.433
I NEVER, EVER DO THIS.

04:05.533 --> 04:08.333
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M SORT
OF NEW TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.767
AND I'M A HUGE
"SEINFELD" FAN.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.633
- NO KIDDING?
- YEAH, THE BIGGEST.

04:12.733 --> 04:14.700
- SERIOUSLY? GET OUT OF HERE.
- YEAH YEAH YEAH, SERIOUSLY.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.300
NO, I'M, PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
"SEINFELD" FAN EVER.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.767
- WHAT A GREAT SHOW.
I MISS IT. I MISS IT!
- AH, GO ON.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.767
"PUFFY SHIRT" IS
MY FAVORITE EPISODE.

04:22.867 --> 04:25.933
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE THAT SHOW.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.833
- REALLY?
- THAT'S ONE OF MY
FAVORITE EPISODES.

04:27.933 --> 04:29.933
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
IT'S GREAT.

04:30.033 --> 04:32.367
HOW DID YOU GUYS COME UP
WITH THE LOW TALKER?

04:32.467 --> 04:36.600
WELL, I MEAN IT WAS
PRETTY EASY TO COME
UP WITH.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.167
I WAS OUT TO DINNER
WITH ONE.

04:38.267 --> 04:40.367
AND THEN YOU WRITE
IT AND YOU PUT IT
ON THE TV.

04:40.467 --> 04:43.333
- YEAH, YEAH.
- I'M NOT AN ARTIST,
YOU KNOW?

04:43.433 --> 04:45.633
SO IT'S INTERESTING
TO SEE HOW AN ARTIST
LIKE YOURSELF WORKS.

04:45.733 --> 04:47.800
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU. THANK YOU.

04:47.900 --> 04:51.000
- IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S REALLY AN HONOR.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.033
I'M RICK LEFTOWITZ.
GREAT TO MEET YOU.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.333
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YEAH.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.767
- WELCOME
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
- THANK YOU.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.367
OH, BOY,
LOOK AT THE JEW GIRL.

05:11.467 --> 05:14.233
- I AM SO JEWISH
RIGHT NOW.
- HOLY COW!

05:14.333 --> 05:15.800
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO THIS?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.100
WELL, SUSIE'S BEEN
COACHING ME THROUGH
IT ALL.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.767
- SHE HAS?
- YEAH.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.400
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
THIS THING IS CALLED?
- THIS IS A, UH...

05:22.500 --> 05:25.033
HAROSET.

05:25.133 --> 05:28.633
- VERY GOOD.
- IT'S A LOT LIKE
AMBROSIA, EXCEPT--

05:28.733 --> 05:31.600
I WISH MY MOTHER WERE
ALIVE TO HEAR YOU SAY
THAT WORD OUT LOUD.

05:31.700 --> 05:34.733
YEAH, I WISH MY MOTHER
COULD HEAR ME SAY--
MY MOTHER WOULD FLIP

05:34.833 --> 05:36.800
- IF SHE KNEW
I WAS DOING THIS.
- LOOKS GOOD.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.933
THANK YOU.
I MEAN, I'M TRYING.

05:40.033 --> 05:44.267
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT
OF TROUBLE YOU PEOPLE
GO THROUGH FOR THIS.

05:44.367 --> 05:47.600
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- "YOU PEOPLE?" I DON'T KNOW
IF I LIKE THAT SO MUCH.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.733
- YOU JEWS, IS THAT BETTER?
- THAT'S BETTER, YEAH.

05:49.833 --> 05:53.967
OKAY, I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN CUTTING APPLES
FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

05:55.367 --> 05:58.267
OKAY, HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:58.367 --> 06:00.700
MARLA AND MARK
GOT BACK TOGETHER.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.933
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:03.033 --> 06:06.600
GOOD FOR THEM.
GOOD FOR THEM!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.833
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.100
THAT'S NICE. THAT'S NICE.
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

06:11.200 --> 06:14.500
ABOUT A WEEK AGO,
AND HE MOVED BACK IN
WITH HER.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.933
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.433
- WOW.
- AND THEY'RE COMING
TOMORROW.

06:18.533 --> 06:20.400
- OH, YOU KNOW
WHO ELSE IS COMING?
- WHO?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.233
JEFF ASKED ME
IF HE COULD BRING
HIS IN-LAWS.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.867
I KNOW.
I TALKED TO SUSIE.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.400
JEEZ, YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REALIZED?

06:27.500 --> 06:30.233
I NEVER FOLLOWED THROUGH
ON MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT
TO MARK.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.767
REMEMBER I GOT
HIM A SUBSCRIPTION
TO THE "TIMES"?

06:33.867 --> 06:35.667
- "THE NEW YORK TIMES."
- YEAH.

06:35.767 --> 06:38.567
AND THEN HE AND MARLA
BROKE UP.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.133
I DON'T KNOW.
I KINDA FORGOT
ABOUT IT.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.267
SO YOU JUST DIDN'T
GIVE HIM HIS GIFT?

06:43.367 --> 06:44.967
YEAH.

06:45.067 --> 06:48.400
- BECAUSE HEROKE UP
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND?
- YEAH.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.433
I DON'T SEE
THE POINT TO IT.

06:51.533 --> 06:54.000
NO, YOU JUST THOUGHT
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT

06:54.100 --> 06:57.233
- AND YOU WOULDN'T SEE
HIM AGAIN, SO WHO CARES?
- OH MY GOD.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.400
WHAT?

07:02.067 --> 07:04.500
I'LL BET YOU MARK--

07:04.600 --> 07:07.067
I'LL BET YOU MARK
IS THE GUY WHO'S
TAKING THE PAPER.

07:07.167 --> 07:11.000
NO, THINK ABOUT
IT, SERIOUSLY.
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:11.100 --> 07:15.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
MARK IS STEALING
THE PAPER.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.200
HOLY SHIT!
DON'T YOU SEE?

07:18.300 --> 07:21.500
HOW LONG HAVE WE
NOT BEEN GETTING IT,
SIX DAYS?

07:21.600 --> 07:25.133
HE MOVED BACK IN
WITH HER A WEEK AGO.
YOU JUST SAID THAT, RIGHT?

07:25.233 --> 07:28.833
WHO ELSE WOULD BE
DOING IT? IT'S HIM.

07:28.933 --> 07:31.833
- MARK IS NOT STEALING
OUR NEWSPAPER.
- NO?

07:31.933 --> 07:34.033
- THAT IS THE MOST
RIDICULOUS--
- I DON'T THINK SO.

07:34.133 --> 07:36.633
OH, I THINK SO.
LARRY, HE'S A DOCTOR.

07:36.733 --> 07:39.700
I THINK HE COULD AFFORD
THE PAPER IF HE WANTS
TO GET A PAPER.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.933
YEAH, BUT NOT IF HE'S
UPSET WITH SOMEBODY

07:42.033 --> 07:45.000
WHO PROMISED HIM A GIFT
FOR CHRISTMAS AND NEVER
FOLLOWED THROUGH ON IT.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.300
- THAT IS SO RIDICULOUS.
- IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS.
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.367
YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE I SPOKE TO...

07:50.467 --> 07:54.467
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO?

07:54.567 --> 07:56.367
WHAT?

07:56.467 --> 08:00.767
WE SHOULD INVITE
MAC AND ETHEL.

08:00.867 --> 08:02.933
WE SHOULD INVITE THEM
FOR SEDER, DON'T YOU THINK?

08:06.433 --> 08:08.800
YOU WANT TO INVITE
ETHEL AND MAC?

08:11.233 --> 08:14.400
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU LIKED MAC
AND ETHEL SO MUCH.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.567
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
JEWISH, OKAY?

08:17.667 --> 08:21.100
BUT IT'S A JEWISH THING.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A TRADITION, YOU KNOW?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.133
INVITE THE CRANKY
NEIGHBORS WHO...

08:23.233 --> 08:25.433
WELL, IF JEWS DON'T HAVE
ANY PLACE TO GO FOR SEDER,

08:25.533 --> 08:27.533
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO INVITE THEM.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.033
COME ON. COME ON.
INVITE 'EM.

08:38.033 --> 08:40.167
HEY, LARRY.

08:40.267 --> 08:43.733
- HEY. RICK, YEAH.
- HEY, RICK.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.033
HEY, LET ME
GIVE YOU A HAND HERE.

08:46.133 --> 08:48.300
- OKAY. OH, THANK YOU.
- YEAH. HOW ARE YA?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.667
PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.

08:50.767 --> 08:53.900
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
ONE OF THOSE CARTS,
YOU KNOW, BUT...

08:54.000 --> 08:57.367
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- LOOK, IT'S DOWNHILL.
I'M WORRIED IT'LL HIT A CAR

08:57.467 --> 09:00.100
AND I'LL GET IN
A LAWSUIT OR SOMETHING.
WHO THE HELL KNOWS?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.067
HEY, WHAT DO YOU
GOT THERE?

09:02.167 --> 09:05.100
OH, MY FOUR IRON.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.233
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.667
YOU PLAY GOLF?

09:09.767 --> 09:12.033
YEAH, AND I EAT
AND I BREATHE.

09:12.133 --> 09:15.533
- ( laughs )
- IN THAT ORDER.

09:15.633 --> 09:17.900
- YEAH, ME, TOO.
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
- REALLY?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.300
WOW, WOW.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.000
ANYWAY, I REPLACED
THE FOUR IRON WITH
A NINE WOOD.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.633
I CAN'T HIT IT ANYMORE.

09:24.733 --> 09:28.267
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU.

09:28.367 --> 09:32.233
OH, COME ON.
NOBODY COULD HELP ME.
PEOPLE HAVE TRIED BEFORE.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.700
IT CAN'T BE DONE.
CAN'T BE DONE, RICK.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.167
I'VE BEEN GOLFING
FOR A LONG TIME.
I'M FAIRLY GOOD.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.967
YEAH, IN MY BACKYARD,

09:40.067 --> 09:43.767
I HAVE THIS SETUP
THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE.
I'VE GOT A NET, A TEE.

09:43.867 --> 09:47.300
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!
REALLY, A CAMERA?
- AND I'VE GOT A CAMERA

09:47.400 --> 09:50.567
AND YOU SHOOT YOURSELF
SWINGING AND THEN ANALYZE
YOUR SWING FRAME-BY-FRAME.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.933
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
- NOTHING.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.000
RIGHT NOW?
OKAY, WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

09:56.100 --> 09:57.533
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.833
- OKAY, I'LL TAKE YOU.
- OKAY.

10:04.933 --> 10:07.167
YOU WANT SOME CHEETOS
FOR THE TRIP, HUH?

10:07.267 --> 10:09.933
YEAH, WHY NOT?
GREAT.

10:10.033 --> 10:13.767
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
I LOVE GOLF.

10:18.567 --> 10:22.433
HA HA HA. HUH?
OH MY GOD. DID YOU
SEE THE WHOLE THING?

10:22.533 --> 10:25.167
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:25.267 --> 10:28.833
COME HERE. COME HERE.
LOOK AT THIS. WATCH IT
IN SLOW MOTION, OKAY?

10:28.933 --> 10:30.333
LOOK AT THAT.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.633
SEE, YOU'RE BRINGING
YOUR HIPS THROUGH.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.467
IT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK--
WHO IS THAT?

10:34.567 --> 10:37.100
- IS THAT ME?
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ME.
- IT'S YOU.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.100
LOOK, LOOK, I WANNA
FREEZE IT RIGHT HERE.
WAIT, RIGHT THERE.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.733
- LOOK AT YOUR HIPS RIGHT HERE.
- YEAH, NO, I SEE. PERFECT.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.833
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

10:45.933 --> 10:48.800
A PLUS. MY BEST
STUDENT OF THE DAY.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.467
GOOD WORK. OKAY.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.233
- YEAH, YEAH.

BEEN BETTER.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR PASSOVER?

11:08.167 --> 11:11.533
JUST HAVING

11:11.633 --> 11:13.367
- OH, REALLY?

11:13.467 --> 11:17.300
NOTHING, NOTHING.
TOTALLY FREE.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.300
YOU WANT TO COME
TO MY HOUSE?

11:30.400 --> 11:33.133
NO, REALLY? OH!

11:33.233 --> 11:35.633
- ALL RIGHT.

11:35.733 --> 11:38.033

11:38.133 --> 11:40.400
NO, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I GOT NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.333

THANK YOU.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.000

11:59.500 --> 12:01.833
Cheryl:

WHERE WERE YOU?

12:01.933 --> 12:03.467
WELL, I MET SORT OF
A NEW FRIEND.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.867
HE'S KIND OF NEW
IN TOWN.

12:05.967 --> 12:08.300
AND WE GOT TO TALKING.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.833
GOLF NUT, OKAY?
TOOK ME TO HIS BACKYARD.

12:11.933 --> 12:15.100
HE'S GOT A NET.
WHAT A SETUP THIS GUY--
MY LIFE IS CHANGED.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.400
TODAY, CHANGED,
IRREVOCABLY.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.233
AND YOU JUST STARTED
TALKING TO A STRANGER?

12:22.333 --> 12:26.600
YEAH, KIND OF, WELL,

12:31.733 --> 12:33.767
AND GONNA BE ALONE
ON PASSOVER,

12:33.867 --> 12:37.433
AND I KIND OF INVITED
HIM TO THE SEDER.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.567
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.567
- YOU DID?
- YEAH, I'M SORRY.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.900
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
- REALLY?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.933
- WELL, IF HE'S ALONE.
- AREN'T YOU A DOLL?

12:48.033 --> 12:50.433
WELL, THAT'S CUTE.
I'M GLAD YOU MADE
A NEW FRIEND.

12:50.533 --> 12:51.900
- YEAH, OKAY, YEAH.
- THAT'S NICE.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.233
I DON'T HEAR THAT
VERY OFTEN FROM YOU.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.933
OH, AND I FORGOT
TO MENTION

12:57.033 --> 12:59.100
IT'S THAT SEX OFFENDER.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.167
WHAT?

13:01.267 --> 13:04.433
YOU KNOW, WE SAW THAT
PICTURE ON THE FLYER

13:04.533 --> 13:06.767
OF THAT SEX OFFENDER GUY.
THAT'S HIM.

13:06.867 --> 13:11.300
- HE'S COOL.
- YOU INVITED A SEX OFFENDER
OVER FOR SEDER?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.367
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

13:13.467 --> 13:16.767
- IT WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, LARRY?

13:16.867 --> 13:18.600
YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WITHOUT
ASKING ME!

13:18.700 --> 13:21.367
YOU DO NOT INVITE
A SEX OFFENDER OVER
FOR DINNER

13:21.467 --> 13:23.067
WITHOUT TALKING
TO ME FIRST!

13:23.167 --> 13:25.600
WE'RE NOT HAVING
A SEX OFFENDER OVER
FOR DINNER, NO!

13:25.700 --> 13:29.833
- CALL HIM AND SAY NO.
- CHERYL, WHAT WOULD
JESUS DO?

13:29.933 --> 13:31.433

13:31.533 --> 13:33.433

13:51.833 --> 13:54.833
THIS IS A FACT.
THIS IS LIKE NUMBERS,
OKAY?

13:54.933 --> 13:57.533
HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE THEORY,
THE 77?

13:57.633 --> 14:01.800
- NO.

THERE'S A GREAT PRESIDENT.

14:01.900 --> 14:05.100

14:05.200 --> 14:08.533
77 YEARS THERE'S--
WHAT'S THAT GUY'S NAME?

14:08.633 --> 14:10.767

77 YEARS, YOU GOT W.

14:13.100 --> 14:16.400

HISTORIC TIMES.

LINCOLN, F.D.R.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.100

- THAT'S RIGHT.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.600
AND WE'RE TURNING
THE WHOLE DAMN WORLD
AROUND.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.500
- JAKE, DID YOU REMEMBER
TO CALL YOUR MOTHER?
- WHAT?

14:26.600 --> 14:28.733
DID YOU REMEMBER
TO CALL YOUR MOTHER?

14:28.833 --> 14:31.900
Jake: I TOLD MY MOTHER
I WOULD CALL HER
AFTER THE SEDER.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.567
- YOU SAID "BEFORE."
- AFTER THE SEDER.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.767
- HEY.

14:35.867 --> 14:38.967
- HOW'S IT GOING, MARK?
HOW'S THE DOCTOR?

14:42.800 --> 14:45.900
YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE BOOMING
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
NICE TO SEE YOU

14:49.867 --> 14:51.200
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED?

14:51.300 --> 14:54.000
YOU COULDN'T CUT IT IN
YOUR SINGLE LIFE THERE?

14:54.100 --> 14:56.600
COULDN'T GET ANY DATES,
SO YOU WENT BACK?

14:56.700 --> 14:59.767
AT'S FUNNY.
PART OF THE PERK
OF BEING A DOCTOR.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.100
IT'S NOT HARD
TO GET DATES.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.167
GET TO SEE A LOT
OF WOMEN NAKED?

15:03.267 --> 15:06.200
- COSMETIC SURGEON.
SEEN MY FAIR SHARE.
- REALLY?

15:06.300 --> 15:07.667
YOU EVER GET AROUSED?

15:07.767 --> 15:09.733
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
REALLY AN APPROPRIATE
QUESTION.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.433
- REALLY, WHY NOT?
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST...

15:12.533 --> 15:14.367
IT'S SORT OF
A PERSONAL THING.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.733
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.800
THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS NO.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.533
PEOPLE COME TO ME FOR HELP.
I HELP THEM.

15:20.633 --> 15:25.100
I UNDERSTAND. TELL ME
IF YOU THINK THIS IS AN
APPROPRIATE QUESTION.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.633
AND I MEAN
NO DISRESPECT.

15:28.733 --> 15:31.033
HAVE YOU BEEN STEALING
MY NEWSPAPER?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.400
LARRY...

15:35.500 --> 15:37.567
YES, THAT IS
AN INAPPROPRIATE QUESTION.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.733
OKAY, SO THAT'S
TWO INAPPROPRIATE
QUESTIONS.

15:39.833 --> 15:43.067
I HAVE NOT BEEN STEALING
YOUR NEWSPAPER, LARRY.
THAT'S APPALLING.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.800
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY, LARRY.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.700
I'M QUITE SURE
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TAKING IT.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.533
ARE YOU POSITIVE,
MARK?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.100
OKAY.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.000
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.733

PERSONALITY.

18:28.433 --> 18:29.567

ON A HOLY DAY.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.600
ANY DAY.

22:07.133 --> 22:08.433
- HAS BEEN STEALING
YOUR NEWSPAPER?
- NO.

22:08.533 --> 22:12.333
NO LUCK AT ALL.

22:12.433 --> 22:15.333
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW,
I'M SURE YOU DON'T,

22:15.433 --> 22:17.933
SOMEBODY'S BEEN STEALING
MY NEWSPAPER

22:18.033 --> 22:21.000
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK--
YES, EVERY DAY.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.567
Mac:
I TELL YOU SOMETHING, MY WIFE,
SHE GOT A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.833
MEAN, A REALLY GOOD LOOK.

22:26.933 --> 22:30.267
IF SHE EVER SEES HIM AGAIN,
SHE'LL RECOGNIZE HIM.

22:30.367 --> 22:32.167
- REALLY?
- SHE'LL KNOW THAT FACE.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.500
SHE NEVER
FORGETS A FACE.

22:37.033 --> 22:38.733
IS SOMETHING WRONG, DOCTOR?

22:38.833 --> 22:42.767
EXCUSE ME, UH, NO.
JUST SOME GEFILTE FISH.

22:42.867 --> 22:46.967
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
SHE'LL WAKE UP SOON

22:47.067 --> 22:49.600
AND COME DOWN AND JOIN US
FOR THE REST OF THE SEDER.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.133
- WOULDN'T THAT
BE NICE, EVERYBODY?
- All: YES, YES.

22:52.233 --> 22:54.400
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL!

22:57.800 --> 22:59.633
( coughs )

23:07.100 --> 23:09.533
HEY, THERE'S NO MATZAH HERE.
LET'S GO, BEAT IT.

23:09.633 --> 23:11.233
COME ON, PFFT,
BEAT IT.

23:16.600 --> 23:34.400
( Jewish dance music
playing )

23:44.800 --> 23:47.567
- ( silverware clanks )
- Larry: WELL, I'VE...

23:47.667 --> 23:49.533
JUST SEEN ETHEL.

23:49.633 --> 23:53.133
SHE'S COMING AROUND.
SHE SHOULD BE DOWN SOON.

23:53.233 --> 23:54.967
Nat:
THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S NICE.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.433
Larry:
HUH? ISN'T THAT GOOD NEWS?

23:57.533 --> 24:01.733
WHAT IS ALL THE...
ALL THAT SOUND, THAT NOISE,

24:01.833 --> 24:03.600
THE RACKET WE ALL
HEARD UPSTAIRS?

24:03.700 --> 24:06.433
OH, MY FOOT FELL ASLEEP
SO I WAS KIND OF JUMPING
UP AND DOWN

24:06.533 --> 24:08.667
- TO GET THE BLOOD
CIRCULATING AGAIN.
- ( laughing )

24:08.767 --> 24:10.367
I HATE WHEN
THAT HAPPENS, RIGHT?

24:14.567 --> 24:16.433
SOMETHING WRONG, DOCTOR?

24:16.533 --> 24:18.733
FOR PETE'S SAKE, I'VE--

24:18.833 --> 24:21.733
I'VE BEEN PAGED BY THE HOSPITAL.
IT MUST BE AN EMERGENCY.

24:21.833 --> 24:25.367
OH MY GOSH!
OH, IT'S A DOCTOR EMERGENCY.

24:25.467 --> 24:28.467
- I'M SO SORRY.
- I DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING, DOCTOR.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.933
- I KEEP MY PAGER ON VIBRATE...
- OH, DO YOU?

24:31.033 --> 24:32.733
- ...FOR MEDICAL
EMERGENCIES, YES.
- UH-HUH.

24:32.833 --> 24:36.100
- THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
- IT WAS GREAT TO MEET YOU.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.067
AREN'T YOU
A COSMETIC SURGEON?

24:38.167 --> 24:41.233
YES, WE HAVE EMERGENCIES
IN THAT FIELD AS WELL.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.500
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD.
ETHEL'S COMING DOWN SOON.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.833
SHE'LL BE UPSET THAT
SHE DIDN'T GET TO MEET YOU.

24:45.933 --> 24:48.100
I'LL MEET HER
ANOTHER TIME,
I'M SURE.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.167
THANK YOU.
MARLA, I'M SORRY.
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

24:50.267 --> 24:51.967
- I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.
- THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

24:52.067 --> 24:53.700
- LOVE YOU.
- FOUND IT!

24:53.800 --> 24:57.167

- ( cheering )

24:57.267 --> 24:59.633
- STEVIE!
- HE FOUND THE MATZAH!

24:59.733 --> 25:01.667
Larry: IN A HURRY, DOCTOR?

25:01.767 --> 25:04.500
- AS I EXPLAINED, I'VE BEEN
PAGED BY MY HOSPITAL.
- YES, I KNOW.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.233
EMERGENCY BOOB JOB,
NO DOUBT.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.567
( clears throat )
I'VE BEEN PAGED FOR
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY

25:08.667 --> 25:11.200
- BECAUSE I AM A DOCTOR.
- YES YES YES.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.433
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YES YES, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

25:13.533 --> 25:16.667
- IT'S A MEDICAL SITUATION.
- YOU'RE LUCKY THAT
OLD LADY FAINTED.

25:16.767 --> 25:19.100
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.833
YOU TOOK THAT PAPER.
I KNOW YOU DID.

25:21.933 --> 25:24.033
I'M A DOCTOR, YOU IDIOT!

25:26.133 --> 25:28.067
GOOD YONTIF.

25:29.267 --> 25:31.233
- LARRY?
- HEY, BUDDY, WHAT'S UP?

25:31.333 --> 25:32.467
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

25:32.567 --> 25:34.800
- SURE, WHAT'S UP?
- UM...

25:34.900 --> 25:37.233
THIS IS REALLY HARD.
I, UH...

25:37.333 --> 25:42.200
I'M... IN THE THROES
OF A MORAL QUANDARY RIGHT NOW,

25:42.300 --> 25:44.733
- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
- OKAY, UM...

25:44.833 --> 25:47.067
I'M NOT REALLY THE RIGHT--
I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON TO...

25:47.167 --> 25:50.200
- OH, I THINK YOU ARE.
YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON.
- ...TO CONFIDE IN, NO NO NO.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.233
WHAT YOU NEED
TO SEE IS A DOCTOR
OR A PSYCHIATRIST,

25:53.333 --> 25:54.833
- A COUNSELOR OF SOME KIND.
- A DOCTOR, NO NO NO.

25:54.933 --> 25:57.667
I'M-- I'M-- I'M CLEAR
ON WHAT I'M TORN ABOUT:

25:57.767 --> 25:59.567
MY ALLEGIANCE TO YOU
AS A FRIEND,

25:59.667 --> 26:02.833
AND NOT WANTING
TO RUIN THE PARTY.

26:02.933 --> 26:05.633
UH, BUT I SAW SOMETHING
VERY SHOCKING,

26:05.733 --> 26:07.667
AND I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.467
WHAT-- WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:10.233 --> 26:12.633
WELL, I SAW MR. DUNKLE

26:12.733 --> 26:15.067
WHISPER IN HIS SON'S EAR.

26:15.167 --> 26:18.100
AND THEN THE BOY WENT RIGHT
OVER AND FOUND THE MATZAH.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.733
OH MY GOD.

26:22.833 --> 26:26.633
YEAH, BECAUSE HE
SAW ME HIDING IT.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.533
WE MADE EYE CONTACT.
HE SAW IT.

26:28.633 --> 26:31.900
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
SORRY.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.067
YEAH, OKAY.

26:34.167 --> 26:37.333
- I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
- OKAY.

26:51.867 --> 26:54.867
WHEN AM I GONNA GET
MY DOLLAR?

26:54.967 --> 26:56.900
OH YEAH, YOUR DOLLAR.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.167
THAT'S RIGHT.
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, STEVIE.

27:00.267 --> 27:03.067
I NOTICE THAT YOU WENT
TO THE BOOKCASE ONCE.

27:03.167 --> 27:06.700
WHAT MADE YOU GO
BACK THERE A SECOND TIME?

27:06.800 --> 27:09.267
HEY, LOOK LOOK,
HE FOUND THE MATZAH,
PAY UP.

27:09.367 --> 27:11.567
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT WHY HE WENT
BACK TO THE BOOKCASE.

27:11.667 --> 27:15.033
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THE THIRD DEGREE.
JUST PAY HIM THE DOLLAR.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.333
- HOW COME YOU
WENT BACK, STEVIE?
- STOP IT!

27:17.433 --> 27:20.233
HE FOUND THE MATZAH,
PAY UP. THAT'S THAT!

27:20.333 --> 27:22.100
- HE FOUND THE MATZAH?
- YEAH!

27:22.200 --> 27:24.467
'CAUSE YOU TOLD HIM
WHERE IT WAS HIDDEN.

27:24.567 --> 27:26.433
- THAT IS A LIE!
- DIDN'T YOU?

27:26.533 --> 27:29.300
- DIDN'T YOU?
- THAT IS A LIE!
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.200
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?
- HOW DO I KNOW?

27:31.300 --> 27:33.267
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

27:35.900 --> 27:38.633
MY FRIEND TOLD ME,
THAT'S HOW I KNOW!

27:38.733 --> 27:42.833
HE SAW YOU WHISPER IN
YOUR SON'S EAR THEN WATCHED
AS HE RAN TO THE BOOKCASE

27:42.933 --> 27:46.800
- AND GOT THE MATZAH.
- OH, YOUR FRIEND THE CONVICTED
SEX OFFENDER!

27:46.900 --> 27:48.600
( all clamoring )

27:56.867 --> 27:59.500
OH MY GOD!
OH MY GOD, THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH SAMMY.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.433
SAMMY, SAMMY, GET UP.

28:01.533 --> 28:03.733
COME ON, COME ON.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY?

28:03.833 --> 28:05.167
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.567
- DOES ANYONE KNOW
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH?
- OH MY GOD!

28:09.200 --> 28:27.133
I DO.

28:39.533 --> 29:46.300
