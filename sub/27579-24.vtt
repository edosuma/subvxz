WEBVTT

00:24.865 --> 00:27.067
"Luck?" That's all
you're gonna say?

00:27.134 --> 00:28.268
How did you... Oh.

00:28.335 --> 00:29.803
Never mind.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.939
Miss Martian and the Team
are following their lead...

00:32.005 --> 00:33.240
We'll follow ours.

00:33.307 --> 00:35.942
And what is our lead?

00:36.009 --> 00:37.344
Why are we here, exactly?

00:37.411 --> 00:39.845
Didn't the Team search
Granny's studio already?

00:39.912 --> 00:40.781
Vic?

00:40.847 --> 00:43.284
[sighs] Okay,
for a while now,

00:43.350 --> 00:46.787
I've been struggling
to figure out the full extent
of my cyber-abilities...

00:46.853 --> 00:48.622
-[phone beeps]
<i>-It all started</i>

00:48.689 --> 00:51.158
<i>when I intercepted a text
</i> <i>from Violet to Brion.</i>

00:51.225 --> 00:53.027
You hacked his phone?

00:53.094 --> 00:57.497
Uh, no. The cybernetic part
of my brain just intercepted
the text.

00:57.564 --> 00:59.432
Things like that
would happen at random.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.167
I couldn't control it.

01:01.234 --> 01:04.671
And back then,
I didn't want to.

01:04.739 --> 01:07.507
But after my recent
Mobius-Tech infusion,

01:07.575 --> 01:09.909
<i>I kinda got a handle
</i> <i>on this "gift".</i>

01:09.977 --> 01:11.313
[screams]

01:11.379 --> 01:13.180
<i>I can reach out with my mind
</i> <i>to anything on the web</i>

01:13.248 --> 01:16.584
<i>or the cloud or, well,
</i> <i>anything electronic, really.</i>

01:16.652 --> 01:20.787
<i>That's how I sensed
</i> <i>Motherbox was in danger
</i> <i>at Granny's house.</i>

01:20.855 --> 01:23.090
<i>So ever since Tara told us
</i> <i>Granny took Violet,</i>

01:23.158 --> 01:26.060
I've been searching
any and everything
related to Gretchen Goode,

01:26.126 --> 01:28.962
Granny Goodness
or Goode World Studios.

01:29.030 --> 01:31.197
How's that different
from what Oracle's been doing?

01:31.265 --> 01:34.034
It's not and it is.

01:34.102 --> 01:37.370
Oracle travels
the information superhighway.

01:37.438 --> 01:40.707
I become the highway
itself.

01:40.775 --> 01:44.179
Okay, Mr. Highway,
what did you find out?

01:44.245 --> 01:49.245
-Uh, let me see
if I can show you.
-[beeping]

01:50.551 --> 01:52.418
Ooo-kay, since when
can you do that?

01:52.486 --> 01:53.921
First time.

01:53.987 --> 01:56.358
Doing a lot of stuff for
the first time these days.

01:56.424 --> 01:59.626
Anyway, I jacked
into the studio's
proprietary network,

01:59.694 --> 02:01.161
and found this.

02:01.227 --> 02:02.530
Building Sixteen,

02:02.596 --> 02:05.099
a storage facility
for props and costumes

02:05.165 --> 02:08.635
with no network connectivity
at all.

02:08.703 --> 02:10.670
Gee, that's not suspicious.

02:10.737 --> 02:12.806
Right. So I checked again

02:12.873 --> 02:15.576
and found a clear
Apokoliptan signature,

02:15.644 --> 02:19.780
which I could sense,
'cause apparently
that's a thing I can do now.

02:19.847 --> 02:21.816
Didn't the Team
already search that building?

02:21.883 --> 02:23.518
They must have
missed something.

02:23.585 --> 02:25.852
If there's even
a one percent chance
Violet's there,

02:25.919 --> 02:26.653
we have to go in.

02:26.721 --> 02:28.756
Yeah, but we go in smart.

02:28.823 --> 02:31.692
And two men short?
What about Static
and Geo-Force?

02:31.758 --> 02:33.427
Didn't want to get
Brion's hopes up.

02:33.495 --> 02:37.564
And Virgil texted he's still
with Jeff. So it's just us.

02:37.631 --> 02:39.133
[drones and beeps]

02:39.199 --> 02:42.536
No heat signatures
in the building,
so no people.

02:42.603 --> 02:43.737
It's safe to go.

02:43.804 --> 02:46.907
Or, you know, "safe".

02:46.973 --> 02:48.542
[Overlord drones]

02:48.609 --> 02:53.609
Yes, I feel it, too.
Company's coming.

02:57.383 --> 03:00.533
[theme music playing]

03:27.782 --> 03:29.650
Man, this is nuts.

03:29.717 --> 03:31.284
Dude, you got us in.

03:31.352 --> 03:32.787
You can wait
on the Bio-Ship.

03:32.854 --> 03:34.320
You don't have to come along.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.824
Yeah, well, thanks, but...

03:36.890 --> 03:39.026
Violet's saved my butt
so many times,

03:39.092 --> 03:40.828
I gotta do this for her.

03:40.895 --> 03:43.264
Time for a little recon.
[imitates laser]

03:43.330 --> 03:46.734
[imitates laser] Look,
look, I'm a Klamulon!

03:46.800 --> 03:48.068
Kid, what are you doing?

03:48.135 --> 03:49.969
Besides trying
to tick me off?

03:50.037 --> 03:50.770
Come on!

03:50.837 --> 03:52.039
The Klamulons are classic!

03:52.105 --> 03:54.608
They have heads
shaped like clams!

03:54.675 --> 03:56.509
Not a cheezy
aesthetic choice at all.

03:56.576 --> 03:58.246
[scoffs] You guys
have no taste.

03:58.312 --> 04:00.948
-Anyway, I checked
the whole place...
-[object clatters]

04:01.014 --> 04:02.817
-[glass shatters]
-...twice. Nothing unusual.

04:02.883 --> 04:07.883
Something definitely
feels weird here.

04:09.389 --> 04:12.990
Almost, almost... There!

04:15.294 --> 04:16.697
[Wonder Girl] Whoa...

04:16.764 --> 04:18.233
[machine droning]

04:18.298 --> 04:22.836
So, a big sci-fi machine,
making a loud, nefarious...

04:22.903 --> 04:26.473
[imitates droning sound]

04:26.540 --> 04:28.742
I'm guessing
it's Klamulon-tech.

04:28.809 --> 04:30.711
[Scarab]<i>The Kid Flash

"Not compatible."

04:36.684 --> 04:38.519
Why do I have
the sinking feeling

04:38.586 --> 04:39.987
I'll be hearing that
a lot tonight?

04:40.053 --> 04:42.255
[Victor] Give me a second.
I can figure it out.

04:42.322 --> 04:43.591
I speak its language.

04:43.656 --> 04:45.793

05:47.754 --> 05:49.490
Let 'em go, Granny.

05:49.555 --> 05:52.192
[laughs] And why
would I do that?

05:52.259 --> 05:54.762
It's your fault
they're in this position.

05:54.829 --> 05:56.963
Such a willful child.

05:57.031 --> 06:01.435
But then, I always was
too soft on my favorite star.

06:01.502 --> 06:03.338
Don't pretend you care.

06:03.403 --> 06:06.706
You only pulled me out
so you could watch me
watch my friends suffer.

06:06.774 --> 06:09.177
That I appreciate
the value of your suffering

06:09.242 --> 06:11.911
is what makes me
an excellent
Hollywood Producer.

06:11.978 --> 06:15.315
But in this case,
I'm trying to do you a favor.

06:15.382 --> 06:20.187
You need discipline
only your Granny can provide.

06:20.252 --> 06:22.588
So I offer a fair fight.

06:22.656 --> 06:27.656

straight to Granny's
cyber-stooge.

10:17.057 --> 10:18.893

10:18.958 --> 10:20.528
is all about
who wants it more.

10:20.595 --> 10:23.029
And no one ever wants
a win more than Vic Stone!

can't beat this bruiser,

the new Vic in the game.

13:21.575 --> 13:23.210
[yells]

13:23.277 --> 13:27.214
No, no, no,
what did I do?

13:27.280 --> 13:31.985
[groans] What...
What's happening?

13:32.052 --> 13:35.489
[sighs in relief]

13:35.554 --> 13:39.494
[Violet] No.

13:39.559 --> 13:41.996
[gasps] Have to heal them.

13:42.062 --> 13:45.131
Violet, wait! I know
you want to fix this, but--

13:45.198 --> 13:47.400
Yes. I remember.

13:47.467 --> 13:49.970
I've been repolarized.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.905
If I simply act
on my instincts,

13:51.972 --> 13:55.576
I'll continue
to enslave everyone
to the Anti-Life Equation.

13:55.643 --> 13:59.647
But I can't leave him...
any of them... like this.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.649
And I believe
there is a way.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.284
[groaning]

14:04.351 --> 14:07.351
Better find it soon!

14:16.096 --> 14:19.096
Rainbow Power. Cool.

14:34.081 --> 14:38.719
[chanting in alien language]

14:38.784 --> 14:40.884
[all groaning]

14:47.227 --> 14:48.528
Violet!

14:48.595 --> 14:50.898
Brion!

14:50.964 --> 14:52.466
No!

14:52.533 --> 14:57.004
You naughty child!
You've ruined everything!

14:57.071 --> 14:59.506
-[growling]
-Violet, look out!

14:59.573 --> 15:02.875
[Granny Goodness yelling]

15:02.942 --> 15:05.346
No! No! No! No! No!

15:05.413 --> 15:07.347
[Violet] Don't worry
about Granny.

15:07.414 --> 15:09.950
I have a few lessons
to teach her.

15:10.017 --> 15:12.253
But first...

15:12.318 --> 15:15.469
Help me destroy this!

15:24.163 --> 15:29.114
It's working!
Keep pouring it on!

15:29.235 --> 15:30.586
[droning]

15:34.908 --> 15:39.908
Uh, we may be doing
too good a job!
It's gonna blow!

15:40.447 --> 15:43.447
Huh, still not dead.

15:46.721 --> 15:51.721
Admit it, you'd all be
chipped beef on toast
without ol' Guy.

15:54.727 --> 15:56.378
[all grunt]

16:04.437 --> 16:07.640
[droning stops]

16:07.706 --> 16:11.010
Oh. My Overlord.

16:11.077 --> 16:13.981
[chuckling] Oh, child, please!

16:14.048 --> 16:17.150
Everything Granny did
was for your own good.

16:17.216 --> 16:19.119
If you only knew
what was coming,

16:19.186 --> 16:21.422
how pointless it was to fight,

16:21.489 --> 16:22.623
you would thank me.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.692
Enough. Your words
are poison.

16:25.759 --> 16:28.628
Insolent girl!

16:28.695 --> 16:29.894
[grunts]

16:34.734 --> 16:38.038
[groans]

16:38.105 --> 16:43.077
Life and Free Will have
triumphed over Anti-Life.

16:43.144 --> 16:46.447
Remember, I know
how to destroy
the Ghost Dimension,

16:46.514 --> 16:50.684
So there's no point
in rebuilding your device.

16:50.751 --> 16:51.952
[Superboy] Oh,
and one other thing,

16:52.019 --> 16:53.287
if you're wondering
how we found you,

16:53.354 --> 16:55.322
you can thank Vandal Savage.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.691
He sent us
and wanted you to know.

16:57.758 --> 16:58.807
[yells]

17:04.932 --> 17:07.334
[Geo-Force] Violet!

17:07.401 --> 17:08.300
Brion!

17:14.541 --> 17:17.612
Um, let's check on
those meta-teen prisoners.

17:17.678 --> 17:19.680
I think we'll find
the Markovian-Eight

17:19.747 --> 17:24.747
and many others
who'd appreciate
a return ticket to Earth.

17:25.486 --> 17:27.087
[M'gann] <i>So where are we?</i>

17:27.154 --> 17:28.588
[Superboy] <i>Where?
</i> <i>We're on Granny's--</i>

17:28.655 --> 17:30.458
[M'gann] <i>Conner, stop.</i>

17:30.523 --> 17:32.727
<i>Where are we?</i>

17:32.794 --> 17:36.230
[Superboy] <i>I...
</i> <i>I don't know, M'gann.</i>

17:36.297 --> 17:40.196
<i>I just don't know.</i>

17:45.573 --> 17:48.107
I have reliable intelligence
that my brother M'comm

17:48.174 --> 17:49.375
has returned to Mars.

17:49.442 --> 17:51.011
With Mantis under arrest,

17:51.078 --> 17:54.280
it's probably safe
for you to return
to New Genesis now.

17:54.347 --> 17:57.751
I mean, if that's what
you'd like.

17:57.818 --> 18:00.054
Think about it.
You're our friend

18:00.121 --> 18:01.454
and more than welcome
to stay on Earth.

18:01.521 --> 18:03.557
We love having you with us.

18:03.624 --> 18:08.095
But we'll respect
whatever decision you make.

18:08.162 --> 18:13.134
[clicks tongue]

18:13.201 --> 18:17.304
[Granny Goodness] Yes,
I failed you, Lord Darkseid.

18:17.371 --> 18:19.307
But all my works in your name,

18:19.374 --> 18:23.178
including the implementation
of the Anti-Life Equation,

18:23.243 --> 18:28.243
was sabotaged by none other
than Vandal Savage.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.989
[Beast Boy] Ugh,
I totally blew it!

18:35.056 --> 18:37.324
I never should have
followed Vic's lead alone.

18:37.391 --> 18:39.460
You didn't.
You brought us.

18:39.527 --> 18:44.527
And Vic. Now he and Violet
are lost forever.

18:46.134 --> 18:49.068
Vic! Violet!
I knew you'd make it!

18:49.135 --> 18:51.204
[chuckles] Good to be back.

18:51.270 --> 18:52.640
Indeed, it is.

18:52.707 --> 18:53.941
There's more good news.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.710
The League will soon
return to Earth

18:55.776 --> 18:57.278
with hundreds of
rescued meta-teens.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.980
Wow. The Taos Youth Center's
going to need more beds.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.415
Maybe more buildings.

19:02.482 --> 19:03.950
And Granny?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.653
She got away.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.954
But we've shut down
her operation in space.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.789
Plus I got proof
Gretchen Goode

19:09.856 --> 19:11.625
and Granny Goodness
are one-in-the-same.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.861
Dude! You M.V.P.'d this puppy!

19:13.928 --> 19:16.163
Nah, man.
Violet's the All-Star.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.932
She rescued everyone
from the Anti-Life Equation.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.103
Which would not have happened
without your intervention,
Victor.

19:22.170 --> 19:26.140
I agree with Garfield.
You are the crusher
of magic today.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.807
All in favor of Vic
joining the Outsiders?

19:28.875 --> 19:30.077
[all] Aye!

19:30.144 --> 19:31.877
And if Static were here,
I know he'd vote aye, too!

19:31.944 --> 19:33.248
Whoa, whoa.

19:33.314 --> 19:36.416
How 'bout asking whether
that's something Vic wants?

19:36.482 --> 19:37.718
Uh...

19:37.785 --> 19:39.854
If being a public hero
is a concern,

19:39.921 --> 19:41.488
you're also welcome
to join the Team.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.557
But doing
something heroic today

19:43.625 --> 19:48.494
does not obligate you
to join the Team
or the Outsiders.

19:48.561 --> 19:50.497
Hmm? [clicks tongue]

19:50.564 --> 19:53.800
You know,
when I played football,

19:53.867 --> 19:55.936
I was never afraid
of the spotlight.

19:56.003 --> 19:58.872
[chuckles]
Man, I sought it out.

19:58.939 --> 20:00.740
But this...

20:00.807 --> 20:04.377
This is in service
of a better cause.

20:04.444 --> 20:07.347
So... I guess...

20:07.413 --> 20:09.249
I guess I'm an Outsider.

20:09.316 --> 20:11.251
[all clamoring excitedly]

20:11.318 --> 20:16.318
Now you'll need a cryptonym,
a, uh, <i>nom de guerre.</i>

20:16.589 --> 20:17.791
You, uh, a what now?

20:17.858 --> 20:20.260
Your code-name. Any ideas?

20:20.327 --> 20:23.663
I believe "Hot Lava"
is still available.

20:23.730 --> 20:25.598
Uh, why would I--

20:25.665 --> 20:28.635
[chuckles] That's what is
called an inside joke.

20:28.702 --> 20:31.538
Choose whatever
code-name suits you.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.040
Hmm.

20:33.106 --> 20:37.009
For too long, I've been
running from what I am.

20:37.076 --> 20:38.880
Who I am.

20:38.945 --> 20:42.316
It's time I embraced
all my freakishness.

20:42.383 --> 20:45.086
I am Cyborg.

20:45.153 --> 20:47.888
Welcome to
the Outsiders, Cyborg.

20:47.954 --> 20:49.189
-[all laughing]
-Booyah.

20:49.256 --> 20:53.006
This has been a good day.

20:56.462 --> 20:58.113
[chuckling]

21:03.537 --> 21:06.173
[high-pitched whing]

21:06.240 --> 21:10.076
[cars honking]

21:10.143 --> 21:13.980
[car door closes]

21:14.048 --> 21:17.184
Whatever you used
on Killer Frost did the trick.

21:17.251 --> 21:20.587
We're way out-trending
the Outsiders now.

21:20.653 --> 21:22.453
Happy, Boss?

21:29.529 --> 21:31.730
[theme music playing]
