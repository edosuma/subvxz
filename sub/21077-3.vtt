10:03.939 --> 10:06.139
Uh, Coach Bundy?
You work here now?

10:06.141 --> 10:08.709
No, you dumb mother...
I mean, yes.

10:08.711 --> 10:10.911
Y'all the reason why I got fired
in the first place.

10:10.913 --> 10:13.580
Damn, bruh, I thought
you'd at least be manager.

10:13.582 --> 10:15.248
- You okay?
- Do I look okay?

10:15.250 --> 10:17.718
I just lost my job
and my wife to Derek Fisher.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.619
For real?
How you know he's smashing?

10:19.621 --> 10:21.088
He left this at my house.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.590
That look awful small
to be D-Fish's headband.

10:23.592 --> 10:25.025
Nah, this is his cock band.

10:25.027 --> 10:27.961
- Now, this is his headband.
- That don't prove shit.

10:27.963 --> 10:30.097
Oh, and, uh,
I walked in on them [bleep].

10:30.099 --> 10:32.899
- Oh, gotcha.
- I'm nothing without Duncan.

10:32.901 --> 10:35.102
As much as I hated
you no-talented bastards,

10:35.104 --> 10:37.204
I loved coaching y'all.
I was tough, [music]

10:37.206 --> 10:39.072
But that's the only way
I know how to coach.

10:39.074 --> 10:40.974
Basketball was my life.

10:40.976 --> 10:43.443
Hey, [bleep] boy. I done
warned you too many times

10:43.445 --> 10:46.980
about getting sentimental
with the customers. You fired.

10:46.982 --> 10:49.583
Damn, that's the second time
I've been fired this week.

10:49.585 --> 10:53.086
Well, nothing left to do
but go smoke some rocks.

10:53.088 --> 10:56.289
It is game time. Now I've
been looking at the analytics

10:56.291 --> 10:57.824
and crunching the data points,

10:57.826 --> 10:59.760
and this strategy works the best.

10:59.762 --> 11:02.629
Randy and Mumblemouth,
I am benching you.

11:02.631 --> 11:04.965
What?! Come on, Coach.
I'm team captain

11:04.967 --> 11:06.633
and the best player on the squad.

11:06.635 --> 11:08.001
[mumbling] Man, how you gonna go on
and bench me like

11:08.003 --> 11:09.612
I'm one of these...
I'm one of these fresh fish?

11:09.647 --> 11:13.173
You're welcome. Grover, Milk,
you're starting the game.

11:13.175 --> 11:14.407
- Oh, hell yeah.
- That's right.

11:14.409 --> 11:15.876
Say what, my nig?

11:15.878 --> 11:18.712
Damn, J.
Guess we all can't be legends.

"Guess we all can't be legends."

11:42.371 --> 11:45.705
It's okay, fellas.
Let's just stand over here.

11:45.707 --> 11:48.308
We may be down 30,
but there is still hope.

11:48.310 --> 11:51.462
It is time to run
Derek Lamar Fisher's

11:51.463 --> 11:53.113
patented circle offense.

11:53.115 --> 11:57.851
- What's the circle offense, Coach?
- Form a circle around me.

11:57.853 --> 12:00.821
[beeping]

12:04.660 --> 12:08.154
Did I ever tell you about the
time the Fish saved the Lakers

12:08.155 --> 12:11.649
from certain doom with
only 0.4 seconds remaining

12:11.650 --> 12:14.201
to beat the San Antonio Spurs?
[music]

12:14.203 --> 12:16.897
Nobody thought he could do it.
Not Phil.

12:16.932 --> 12:20.073
Not Shaq.
Not Kobe's bitch ass.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.242
So he willed himself to greatness.

12:22.244 --> 12:23.710
[whistle blows]
Come on now, Coach.

12:23.712 --> 12:25.378
We got a game to play.
Let's go.

12:25.380 --> 12:27.881
I'ma have to call
all our timeouts, Ref.

12:27.883 --> 12:31.585
This story has three minutes
and 42 seconds remaining.

12:31.587 --> 12:33.119
Now where was I?

12:33.121 --> 12:35.555
Gary Payton was taking the ball
out of bounds.

12:35.557 --> 12:40.026
<i>I was supposed to be setting a screen
for Mr. Kobe Bryant himself. [Music]</i>

12:40.028 --> 12:43.530

be competent in making the shot.</i>

12:46.568 --> 12:48.101
This nigga!

12:48.103 --> 12:50.203
Y'all not listening.
D-Fish's game plan

12:50.205 --> 12:53.740
is to smash all the boo'd-up
chicks in Chamberlain Heights.

12:53.742 --> 12:57.161
That meat print is out there.
It can't be bargained with.

12:57.162 --> 13:01.132
It can't be reasoned with.
It doesn't feel pity,

13:01.133 --> 13:05.785
and it won't stop, ever,
until you get [bleep].

13:05.787 --> 13:07.921
Come on, Jamal.
That sounds scandy.

13:07.923 --> 13:10.156
- D-Fish a good dude.
- Good dude?

13:10.158 --> 13:13.193
He did it to Matt Barnes.
He did it to Coach Bundy.

13:13.195 --> 13:15.662
Now he finna churn some Hunny!

13:15.664 --> 13:18.932
Milk, your mom is next.
Then Cindy.

13:18.934 --> 13:21.581
We gotta stop that mark.

13:37.602 --> 13:42.137
So, uh, how long we just gonna
stand here and watch this?

13:42.139 --> 13:44.306
Well, at least he using protection.

13:44.308 --> 13:45.941
What, he think my mom
a ho or something?

13:45.943 --> 13:47.576
Not on my watch.

- Oh, Milton...

13:49.080 --> 13:52.963
- Yo, fellas, fellas, what is happening here?
- Uh, did you...

13:52.998 --> 13:53.716
did you lose your house key again?

13:53.718 --> 13:55.985
All I needed was another 24 seconds,

13:55.987 --> 13:57.820
and I would have
drained my balls from deep.

13:57.822 --> 14:00.055
Shut your ass up, D-Fish.
You ain't even have

14:00.057 --> 14:01.991
the common courtesy
to raw dog my mom.

14:01.993 --> 14:05.327
- You ain't shit, homey.
- Milton, get the hell out of here!

14:05.329 --> 14:07.863
- I was almost there.
- Ew, Mom! Shit!

14:07.865 --> 14:09.531
Mrs. Milk, we just wanna tell you that

14:09.533 --> 14:12.735
- Coach Fish ain't who he say he is.
- See for yourself.

14:12.737 --> 14:15.204
You will return that to me
immediately.

14:18.242 --> 14:20.476
We tellin' Principal Rivers
the whole story.

14:20.478 --> 14:23.112

14:23.114 --> 14:26.348
Tighten it back up.
I'll be back.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.084
until after we were married.
I can't wait to spend

15:02.086 --> 15:05.054

Yo, is that Bundy coaching
a team with no team?

15:14.098 --> 15:16.999
- I'ma go holler at him right quick.
- Be careful, my nig.

15:17.001 --> 15:20.669
Guaranteed he ain't brushed
his teeth in a cool minute.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.538
Hey, Coach.
It's me, Grover.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.506

How many times I gotta tell you

15:24.508 --> 15:26.709

Come on, Montrel!

15:26.711 --> 15:29.311
Get your head in the game,
mother[bleep]!

15:29.313 --> 15:31.113
We need you back at Duncan, Coach.

15:31.115 --> 15:32.981
D-Fish is ruining everything here.

15:32.983 --> 15:36.152
Your breath and your coaching stink,
but at least you care.

15:36.153 --> 15:39.422
Come on back, Coach.
God damn, you stink!

15:39.423 --> 15:43.133
[music]

15:44.462 --> 15:47.029
I got your text, Grover.
What's the big emergency?

15:47.031 --> 15:49.631
We just found out Coach
Fisher's shadier than Slim

15:49.633 --> 15:52.034
when he's with Kim
with no lights on in the gym.

15:52.036 --> 15:53.068
<i>Both: Bars!</i>

15:53.070 --> 15:54.770
Why you guys hating
on Coach Fisher?

15:54.772 --> 15:56.405
He's been nothing but a gentleman.

15:56.407 --> 15:58.774
He says he's gonna introduce me
to his friend,

15:58.776 --> 16:01.210
- Meat Print Papi.
- No, you don't wanna meet him.

16:01.212 --> 16:03.946
He's trying to terminate every
chick in CH that's boo'd up.

16:03.948 --> 16:05.948
It's my job to keep that booty safe.

16:05.950 --> 16:08.484
Yeah, he already broke up
Coach Bundy's marriage

16:08.486 --> 16:10.586
and remodeled Milk's mom's interior.

16:10.588 --> 16:14.223
Let's just say she now has
a basement and a storm shed.

16:14.225 --> 16:15.991
And you next on the list.

16:15.993 --> 16:17.826
I bet he does this
everywhere he goes.

16:17.828 --> 16:20.829
Lakers, Knicks... shit, I heard
by the time he left Utah,

16:20.831 --> 16:23.966
- the Jazz spelled their name with a "I".
- Ugh, that sick bastard.

16:23.968 --> 16:26.635
How the hell do we get rid of him?
[blows]

16:26.637 --> 16:30.072
Now I heard y'all was having
a little issue with D-Fish.

16:30.074 --> 16:33.108
I can help you with that.
I used to hoop with Matt Barnes

16:33.110 --> 16:34.877
back in the summers at
the Drew League.

16:34.879 --> 16:37.780
Now, Matt is one of the
realest niggas on the planet.

16:37.782 --> 16:40.883
Don't think he would mind
sending another message to D-Fish.

16:40.885 --> 16:42.451
How we gonna
get in touch with Matt?

16:42.453 --> 16:44.420
Oh, I can holler,
but that's gonna run you

20:10.732 --> 20:11.998
Come on, Coach, you tripping.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.567
There's only five seconds left.
Maybe next game.

20:14.569 --> 20:17.470
I'm trying to be nice
to you mother[bleep]s!

20:17.472 --> 20:20.039
Now get your ass in the game!
Milk, come here.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.908
Man, what you want, dookie breath?

20:21.910 --> 20:25.177
I know we haven't seen eye to eye,
but I believe in you, boy.

20:25.179 --> 20:27.713
So as soon as you get that ball,
want you to shoot it. [Music]

20:27.715 --> 20:29.782
Oh, for real?
I got the green light?

20:29.784 --> 20:34.036
This your time, Milk.
I believe you can fly, mother[bleep].

20:34.923 --> 20:36.622
[whistle blows]

20:36.624 --> 20:39.425
[crowd shouting]

20:39.427 --> 20:40.826
[buzzer sounds]
[all gasp]

20:40.828 --> 20:42.828
Air ball!

20:42.830 --> 20:44.397
<i>All: Air ball!</i>

20:44.399 --> 20:47.644
Worldstar!
Got you, mother[bleep].

20:47.679 --> 20:48.935
[all laugh]

20:48.937 --> 20:50.636
<i>Got him!</i>
