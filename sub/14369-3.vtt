00:03.294 --> 00:04.921
But I'm not going away
for good, you know.

00:05.004 --> 00:08.341
(<i> softly</i> ):
We'll just see about that.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.593
No one loves Ginger
more than me.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.469
{\an1}What?

00:11.553 --> 00:12.429
Hey, don't do...

(<i> with man's voice</i> ):
Hello, children.

00:19.018 --> 00:22.772
Ginger didn't get into
that school on her own.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.774
Miranda and Mipsy
were behind the whole thing.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.777
She's a new
fellowship transplant,

00:27.861 --> 00:29.446
so don't get too attached.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.114
It might be hard.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.615
What's going on, Ginge?

00:32.698 --> 00:34.951
I can't stop thinking about you.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.786
If she thinks
we've turned on her,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.621
she might stay up there
for good.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.750

DARREN:
Remember way back when

01:41.226 --> 01:43.812
I said I thought
we were just friends,

01:43.895 --> 01:44.687
but...

01:44.771 --> 01:47.273
(<i> mutters</i> ):
Oh, man.

01:47.357 --> 01:47.690
(<i> sighs</i> )

01:47.774 --> 01:49.317
{\an8}Hi... hi, Ginger.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.612
{\an8}I think I may have accidentally
fallen in love with you

01:52.695 --> 01:56.157
{\an8}while you were gone.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.325
{\an8}Hey, surprise, it's me!

01:57.408 --> 01:58.701
{\an8}Just found myself
in the neighborhood.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.829
{\an8}Hey, you-- nut job--

02:00.912 --> 02:02.872
{\an7}you buying a ticket
or what?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.165
{\an7}We're shoving
off here.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.792
{\an8}I know you can't possibly
answer this question

02:05.875 --> 02:08.711
{\an8}but I have
this overwhelming feeling

02:08.794 --> 02:10.755
{\an8}I've fallen in love
with my best friend

02:10.839 --> 02:11.756
and I don't want
to mess things up,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.259
but I feel I should tell her,

02:14.342 --> 02:16.511
{\an1}only I have no idea
how she'll react.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.179
She may have met someone.

02:18.263 --> 02:18.888
What do think I should do?

02:18.972 --> 02:22.016
{\an1}CONDUCTOR:
Let's go get our gal.

02:26.563 --> 02:30.650
I don't why this hurts
my feelings, but it does.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.860
{\an8}Yeah, well, onward
and upward, Ginger.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.903
{\an8}You have plenty
of new friends here.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.906
Darren hasn't written me once.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.033
I guess they've all moved on.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.703
But like you said,
change can be good.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.580
So you still up
for yours?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.248
Yeah.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.213
{\an1}Get ready to meet
the new you.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.764
{\an1}(<i> in man's voice</i> ):
Open up, Carl.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.641
I'd like to speak with you.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.406
It's no use.

03:18.489 --> 03:19.449
I'm too upset to be powerful.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.951
(<i> yelps</i> )

03:22.035 --> 03:24.621
{\an5}CARL:
I'm not going
on that stupid trip tomorrow,

03:24.704 --> 03:26.539
so you two lovebirds
can go alone,

03:26.623 --> 03:28.333
{\an1}and have
a great time.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.794
{\an5}(<i> as Hoodsey</i> ):
This may be the prosthetic nose
talking, Carl,

03:31.878 --> 03:33.796
but I would never betray you.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.591
{\an1}And if you believe
I betray

03:36.674 --> 03:38.259
{\an1}then it is you
who betrays <i> you!</i>

03:41.888 --> 03:44.140
(<i> in man's voice</i> ):
I've done all I can.

03:44.223 --> 03:45.725
Good-bye, children.

03:53.274 --> 03:57.695
If Gripling's bootie beats
the two of those guys,

03:57.779 --> 03:58.905
what do I care?

03:58.988 --> 04:00.156
(<i> sighs</i> )

04:00.239 --> 04:02.408
I'm on my own now.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.211
of the girl you like
into this tree

04:13.294 --> 04:14.295
she'll like
you back.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.755
Coming to the bonfire tonight?

04:15.838 --> 04:17.507
We're rapping about
<i>Jennifer's Ghost.</i>

04:17.589 --> 04:18.632
Did you read it?

04:18.716 --> 04:19.050
{\an1}Nuh-uh.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.593
Serial fiction.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.178
It's pretty powerful stuff.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.346
Cool.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.974
I'll check it out
and see you there tonight.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.475
Bye.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.694
{\an1}DODIE:
Oh, oh.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.489
Get a picture of me
with the faux fur night stand.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.449
Oh, you look
great together.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.909
{\an1}Hey, Courtney,
is it true

04:44.993 --> 04:47.620
your toilet features
the motion-sensor flush?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.831
And if so, can I try it out?

04:49.914 --> 04:50.540
(<i> phone rings</i> )

04:50.623 --> 04:52.500
{\an1}Ooh, ooh.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.710
I'll get it,
I'll get it.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.711
Oh, no, no.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.211
Let me, let me.

04:55.294 --> 04:56.879
(<i> clears throat</i> )

04:56.963 --> 04:57.839
Courtney Gripling's room.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.383
This is Dodie speaking.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.384
Ew!

05:07.932 --> 05:10.351
This is Miranda--
Courtney, please.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.561
It's Miranda.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.854
They know we know.

05:12.937 --> 05:13.563
The jig is up.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.773
{\an3}Hide.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.025

05:17.108 --> 05:19.110
I'll handle this.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.445
Ahem.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.905
Your best friend has moved on,
so why don't you?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.159
(<i> phone clicks off</i> )

05:26.242 --> 05:28.077
That was cold.

She totally knows.

"Jennifer's ghost moved
through her childhood bedroom.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.881
"Everything was just
as she had left it.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.216
"The house smelled of dinner,
and her mom could be heard

05:42.300 --> 05:44.594
rattling around downstairs
in the kitchen."

05:44.677 --> 05:47.722
{\an1}Ginger.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.308
"Jennifer had been
away for so long

05:50.391 --> 05:54.103
"she convinced herself
that she didn't miss it,

05:54.187 --> 05:57.106
"but returning home brought all
the old feelings to the surface.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.943
"Jennifer's ghost looked
in the mirror

06:01.027 --> 06:02.403
"but her reflection was gone.

06:02.487 --> 06:06.449

"as her mother called
the family to dinner.

She wished she could join them
just one more time."

you came all this way.

06:20.379 --> 06:20.880
Just do something.

This moose, he's...

06:32.183 --> 06:33.059
Who are you?

06:33.142 --> 06:35.603
It's not a moose,
Darren, it's an elk.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.521
Same difference.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.356
{\an1}It's just a fancy way
of saying it.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.566
Okay, Darren, so just
don't bother him

06:40.650 --> 06:41.818
and he won't bother you.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.527
{\an1}Fine!

It's nice

06:46.906 --> 06:47.698
{\an1}of discussing

06:47.782 --> 06:49.659
so take a hike.

06:49.742 --> 06:49.992
<i>Jennifer's Ghost?</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:51.744
Didn't see it.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.162
But anyone catch that
Harley James flick?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.748
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
It was so sick.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.792
Remember the part where
the vampire chick throws him

06:57.875 --> 07:00.128
off the motorcycle?

07:00.211 --> 07:03.506
Then he's all, like,
"Sorry, baby-- got to roll."

07:03.589 --> 07:05.508
{\an1}GIRL (<i> huffs</i> ):
What a loser.

07:05.591 --> 07:10.179
{\an5}We're not talking
about some stupid
movie, Darren, okay?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.848
Okay.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.641
Do you want to go
back to my room

07:13.724 --> 07:15.101
and dry off
or something?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.310
{\an1}I could meet you
in a few minutes and...

07:16.394 --> 07:21.023
Don't worry about it,
Ginger... really.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.695
Guess your hair's not the only
thing that changed, huh?

07:25.778 --> 07:26.362
Sorry if
I embarrassed you

07:26.445 --> 07:27.738
in front of
your new friends.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.739

An ice storm is rapidly moving

07:35.204 --> 07:37.832
A serious advisory is in effect.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.167
Those who must venture out

07:39.250 --> 07:41.210
are urged to do so
with extreme caution.

Oh, I can't believe you're out
there in this mess, Darren.

Where's the picture?

07:57.518 --> 08:01.063
Thea, where's the picture
of my friends?

08:01.147 --> 08:04.150
Uh... I put it away.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.276
(<i> yawns</i> )

08:05.359 --> 08:07.945
I just figured it was
part of your past.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.113
{\an1}Well, it's not
part of my past, okay?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.240
It's part of my present.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.576
{\an1}This semester is
going to be over soon

08:13.659 --> 08:14.911
and then I'm going home.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.329
But you don't have
to go home, Ginger.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.248
I was going to wait
until morning

08:19.332 --> 08:20.499
to tell you this,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.752
but Avalanche is
going to offer you

08:22.835 --> 08:23.586
a full-time scholarship.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.422
So you can stay here
through high school.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.090
What? I thought
they didn't offer full...

08:28.174 --> 08:29.592
They made an
exception for you.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.720
{\an5}You must have friends
in high places
or something.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.679
No, I don't.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.099
{\an1}My friends are
in Sheltered Shrubs.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.017
Where are you going?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.727
I'm not going to be
like Jennifer's ghost.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.104
I'm not going to go home

08:42.188 --> 08:44.565
and find that I've been
written out of my own life

08:44.649 --> 08:46.817
and I'm not taking
that scholarship, Thea.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.821
(<i> sarcastically</i> ):
Oh, great.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.782
{\an1}COURTNEY:
Good morning, Winston.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.033
Hope I'm not waking you.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.451
Oh, not at all, miss.

08:55.534 --> 08:58.162
Master Blake and I
have been up for hours.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.331
Today's the big day,
you know.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.959
Look, Winston, I need you to
drive us up to Avalanche County.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.126
It's urgent.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.628
Oh, terribly sorry,

09:05.711 --> 09:10.132
but I'm afraid my services
have already been secured

09:10.216 --> 09:11.300
by Master Blake.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.678
Today is the
Weird Human Winterfest

09:13.761 --> 09:16.305
{\an5}WINSTON:
and I'm his chaperone,
as it were.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.267
{\an4}Why is it Blake's
misadventures always
come before mine?

09:19.350 --> 09:21.978
I guess we can
always take the bus.

09:22.061 --> 09:22.478
{\an1}Nonsense!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.272
I'm Courtney Gripling

09:24.355 --> 09:26.482
{\an1}and we've got
a mission to complete.

09:26.565 --> 09:31.654
{\an5}(<i> sweetly</i> ):
Giselle, I'd like to arrange for
transportation via helicopter.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.408
Please ring the pilot and
tell him this is an emergency.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.326
(<i> trembling</i> ):
Helicopter?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.537
(<i> gasps</i> )

09:45.251 --> 09:45.876
(<i> boy sniggers</i> )

09:45.960 --> 09:47.169
You want to see
something gross?

09:47.253 --> 09:49.714
I most certainly
do not.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.844
I don't want to go,
Mr. Hoodsdonowitz.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.721
{\an1}(<i> in man's voice</i> ):
There, there.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.472
{\an1}Let's do it for Carl,
shall we?

09:58.556 --> 09:59.432
BLAKE:
Sussman--

09:59.515 --> 10:02.643
there's something
vaguely familiar

10:02.727 --> 10:03.978
about your
"chaperone."

10:04.061 --> 10:06.689
Hello, children.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.606
Yes...

10:07.690 --> 10:09.150
something vaguely
familiar, indeed.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.444
What are your thoughts

10:11.527 --> 10:13.529
{\an1}regarding
cheesecake pudding?

10:13.612 --> 10:14.947
Don't answer.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.742
{\an5}NOELLE:
Mind your own business,
Gripling.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.786
Ah, a distinctly
Carl Foutley-like reply.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.623
His severing all ties
must deeply sadden you

10:24.707 --> 10:26.542
and your "chaperone."

10:26.625 --> 10:28.002
He'll come around...

10:28.085 --> 10:31.797
when we win that freak fest
in the name of Carl.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.632
{\an5}BLAKE:
Why on earth would you
bother doing that?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.260
He called just this
morning to wish me luck

10:36.344 --> 10:37.970
in hopes that
I would beat <i> you.</i>

10:38.054 --> 10:40.056
{\an1}(<i> gasps</i> )

10:40.139 --> 10:41.432
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.351
He's lying--
he has to be.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.561
HOODSEY:
I say we shift focus.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.063
Instead of winning
that contest <i> for</i> Carl...

10:47.146 --> 10:48.439
(<i> zipper zips</i> )

10:48.522 --> 10:51.650
...let's try winning it
in spite of him.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.485
Huh?

10:52.568 --> 10:54.904
Wish I had some chicken fat.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.155
(<i> shivers</i> )

10:58.491 --> 11:01.535
COURTNEY:
Visibility schmisibility.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.579
Set down this aircraft.

11:03.662 --> 11:04.997
Set down, I say.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.418
Let's go.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.839
Okay, where is she?

11:14.924 --> 11:17.385
It's so nice
to finally meet you guys.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.761
I've heard so much.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.805
Cut the
small talk, Missy.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.641
It's not Missy, it's Mipsy.

11:26.018 --> 11:26.560
Well, you...

11:26.644 --> 11:29.105
(<i> gasps</i> ):
You're...

11:29.188 --> 11:30.648
{\an1}A Mipson,
that's right.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.651
{\an1}And I'm not going
to let the three of you

11:33.734 --> 11:34.735
{\an1}foul up my little
cash cow.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.489
So just sit down on the bed
and no one gets hurt.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.996
GINGER:
Darren!

11:46.080 --> 11:48.290
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>I said it before</i>
<i>and I'll say it again:</i>

11:48.374 --> 11:50.376
<i>when you're suddenly forced</i>
<i>to say good-bye</i>

11:50.459 --> 11:51.460
<i>to someone you love,</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:52.837
<i>it's in that moment</i>

11:52.920 --> 11:55.881
<i>that you truly come to</i>
<i>appreciate who they are.</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:09.478
<i>If anything has happened</i>
<i>to Darren,</i>

12:09.562 --> 12:11.397
<i>I don't know what I'll do.</i>

12:18.237 --> 12:18.904
HOODSDONOWITZ:
Ultimately,

12:18.988 --> 12:21.907
orthodontia can be
very rewarding--

12:21.991 --> 12:23.075
very rewarding.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.118
You'll see.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.035
I want to go home.

12:25.119 --> 12:25.494
What?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.872
I want to go home.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.459
There's no point in me doing
this stupid competition anymore.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.585
I want to go home!

12:32.668 --> 12:34.336
(<i> over loudspeaker</i> ):
Rest stop.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.172
Those of you <i> with</i> legs,
feel free to stretch them.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.549
Look, let's go
inside,

12:38.632 --> 12:40.676
get some rest-stop
cheese fries

12:40.759 --> 12:42.052
and talk this
whole thing over.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.012
Okay?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.055
{\an1}Okay.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.809
Couple more seconds.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.561
Got to wait till it boils.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.481
{\an5}Look, Noelle,
it's perfectly
understandable

12:53.564 --> 12:54.648
{\an1}that you would feel
reluctant

12:54.732 --> 12:57.401
{\an1}to go forward with
the freak fest, but...

12:57.485 --> 13:00.154
Drop the Hoodsdonowitz
routine.

13:00.237 --> 13:00.946
(<i> as Hoodsey</i> ):
Hey!

13:01.030 --> 13:03.532
I just want things back
to normal.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.535
Wish we never went
on this stupid trip.

13:08.829 --> 13:12.333
{\an1}I'm not getting off the bus
when we get there.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.501
You can't make me.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.085
The bus!

13:16.295 --> 13:20.591
(<i> grunting</i> )

13:22.468 --> 13:23.010
{\an1}Oh, great.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.721
{\an1}We totally missed
the bus.

13:25.804 --> 13:26.680
Good.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.723
Good?

13:27.806 --> 13:28.724
Good?!

13:28.807 --> 13:31.018
Is it good that
we're stranded?

13:31.101 --> 13:34.355
{\an1}Make it come back, Noelle--
telekinetically.

13:39.109 --> 13:46.116
(<i> grunting</i> )

13:55.543 --> 13:56.627
Carl?

13:56.710 --> 13:58.128
Is that you?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.339
(<i> grunts</i> )

14:00.422 --> 14:01.590
(<i> panting</i> )

14:01.674 --> 14:02.758
Carl!

14:02.841 --> 14:04.927
Wait up!

14:05.010 --> 14:06.512
Noelle!

14:06.595 --> 14:08.222
(<i> groans</i> )

14:08.305 --> 14:11.934
{\an5}HOODSEY:
Come back here with
those cheese fries!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.855
Carl, stop!

14:16.939 --> 14:18.274
(<i> Hoodsey moans</i> )

14:18.357 --> 14:21.277
Why are you chasing
after him, Noelle?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.112
He was rooting
for Gripling's hiney.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.030
Was not!

14:25.114 --> 14:26.949
That's what Gripling said.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.701
Well, Gripling lied!

14:28.784 --> 14:33.789
{\an5}The only reason Hoodsey
and I ever got involved
in the freak fest

14:33.872 --> 14:35.416
was for you, Carl.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.502
You two are the traitors,
not me!

14:38.586 --> 14:40.671
That's not true, Carl.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.130
You're the traitor!

14:41.213 --> 14:42.131
You are!

14:42.214 --> 14:44.133
You are!

14:44.216 --> 14:45.968
{\an1}I bet if we were
starving out here,

14:46.051 --> 14:47.386
you two would
eat me first!

14:47.469 --> 14:49.346
No, we wouldn't, Carl!

14:49.430 --> 14:50.681
You'd eat me!

14:50.764 --> 14:52.141
No, I wouldn't!

14:52.224 --> 14:52.600
Yes, you would!

14:52.683 --> 14:55.144
You'd both eat me!

14:55.227 --> 14:56.478
That's not true!

14:56.562 --> 14:57.313
Who would you eat?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.982
I'd eat the cheese fries
if you'd let me,

15:00.065 --> 15:01.317
but you'd probably
give them to Carl!

15:01.400 --> 15:04.111
No, I wouldn't!

15:04.194 --> 15:04.528
Yes, you would!

15:04.612 --> 15:06.905
No, she wouldn't!

15:06.989 --> 15:08.115
Yes, I would, Carl!

15:08.198 --> 15:10.034
{\an3}See?!

15:10.117 --> 15:11.827
Well, she kissed you!

15:11.910 --> 15:14.496
Oh, so what, Carl?

15:14.580 --> 15:15.414
So what?

15:15.497 --> 15:16.457
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

15:16.540 --> 15:17.082
(<i> groans</i> )

15:17.166 --> 15:19.168
BOTH:
What's that noise?

15:19.251 --> 15:21.670
(<i> both gasping</i> )

15:21.754 --> 15:24.131
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

15:24.214 --> 15:27.092
(<i> grunting</i> )

15:33.015 --> 15:34.058
Carl!

15:34.141 --> 15:35.351
Oh, my gosh!

15:35.434 --> 15:37.853
Help!

15:37.936 --> 15:42.232
{\an5}Noelle, he's going
to drown, or freeze,
or both!

15:42.316 --> 15:44.860
You have to use your
powers to save him!

15:44.943 --> 15:46.362
{\an1}CARL:
Noelle!

15:46.445 --> 15:48.322
(<i> grunts</i> )

15:50.449 --> 15:52.701
(<i> screaming</i> )

15:53.952 --> 15:56.163
(<i> groaning</i> )

15:58.415 --> 15:59.708
(<i> grunts</i> )

15:59.792 --> 16:01.126
Hello, Carl.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.002
(<i> gasps</i> )

16:06.548 --> 16:10.386
Man, am I glad to see you.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.845
Thanks, Hoods.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.764
Thanks, Noelle.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.183
You saved my life.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.935
(<i> engine rumbling</i> )

16:19.853 --> 16:20.270
(<i> gasps</i> )

16:20.354 --> 16:22.648
Carl?!

16:24.066 --> 16:26.443
What in the world
are you doing here?

16:26.527 --> 16:29.571
Just hanging out
with my best friend

16:29.655 --> 16:32.157
and my...
girlfriend.

16:33.367 --> 16:33.826
Pile on, you guys.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.078
I'm heading into town.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.221
(<i> panting</i> )

16:59.017 --> 17:01.729
{\an5}DARREN:
And all of a sudden
there's a moose, right.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.231
This moose is just
bigger than...

17:04.314 --> 17:05.941
And it's huge.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.401
And I...

17:07.483 --> 17:09.528
Darren.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.238
{\an1}Excuse me.

17:11.320 --> 17:14.031
{\an4}I've been looking
for you all night--
since you left.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.117
Why?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.703
{\an1}Why? Because I was worried
about you, Darren.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.746
That's why.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.579
Oh.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.498
What are you doing up here?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.250
Why did you come to see me?

17:23.333 --> 17:24.460
Why?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.086
{\an3}Why?!

17:26.170 --> 17:27.296
Because I think

17:27.378 --> 17:30.424
I might be madly in love
with you-- that's why!

17:30.507 --> 17:32.801
Wh... what?

17:32.885 --> 17:36.305
But there's only one way
to know for sure.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.435
Oh.

17:46.106 --> 17:46.899
Wow.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.610
{\an1}Maybe I should go away
more often.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.861
I really hope not,
Ginger,

17:50.944 --> 17:55.449
{\an5}because I'll kind of
be counting the moments
until you come back.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.494
{\an1}HOODSEY:
Darren, wait up!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.120
So long, Sis.

18:00.204 --> 18:04.249
Oh, um, and I'd appreciate
you not mentioning anything

18:04.333 --> 18:06.668
about my near-death
experience to mom.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.295
Thanks in advance.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.177
{\an1}That her?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.678
Yep.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.773
Dodie and Macie are never going
to believe this one.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.317
(<i> train horn blows</i> )

18:30.400 --> 18:34.363
(<i> girls squealing and laughing</i> )

18:34.446 --> 18:37.199
You guys, what are
you doing here?

18:37.282 --> 18:38.408
We came to tell you

18:38.492 --> 18:40.452
that you can't take
that scholarship, Ginger.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.954
Those photographs and letters

18:42.037 --> 18:44.456
{\an1}were total Miranda-Mipsy
propaganda, Ginger.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.917
And we didn't want you to think
that we were being disloyal.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.670
Because we really want
you to come home.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.297
And your roommate, Thea...

18:52.381 --> 18:54.716
Is a total Mipson,
as it turns out.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.803
{\an5}She hatched
the scholarship plot
with Miranda and Mipsy

18:57.886 --> 18:59.596
to help keep you out
of Sheltered Shrubs.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.389
Thea?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.765
Where is she?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.184
(<i> knocking</i> )

19:06.854 --> 19:08.063
Oh, my gosh!

19:08.146 --> 19:09.064
You're...

19:09.147 --> 19:10.148
A Mipson.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.024
Yeah, it's true.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.442
It's nothing personal.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.694
{\an1}I was just really looking
for a way to support

19:13.777 --> 19:15.654
my catalog-shopping habit.

19:15.737 --> 19:16.780
No offense.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.574
You mean, so all this time,

19:18.657 --> 19:20.075
you were just pretending
to be my friend?

19:20.158 --> 19:24.037
{\an1}Yep, but it sounds so harsh
when you say it that way.

19:24.121 --> 19:24.955
The truth is,

19:25.038 --> 19:25.581
you kind of grew
on me, Ginger.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.748
I might even
miss you.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.126
And Courtney, f-y-i,

19:29.209 --> 19:31.253
the only reason
the other Mipsy and Miranda

19:31.336 --> 19:33.422
went to all this trouble
to get rid of Ginger

19:33.505 --> 19:36.091
is because they wanted
more attention from you.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.051
They really look up
to you, you know?

19:38.135 --> 19:38.635
{\an3}Later.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.096
Of course they do.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.556
That is so sweet

19:42.639 --> 19:47.102
{\an5}in a really twisted,
self-destructive,
stalker kind of way.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.270
(<i> phone beeps</i> )

19:48.353 --> 19:49.187
This is Courtney,

19:49.271 --> 19:50.022
and I'm ready for takeoff.

19:50.105 --> 19:53.108
Set down on the roof
of the dormitory.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.359
Be there in a flash.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.655
{\an1}Toodles.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.698
Oh, sorry.

19:59.781 --> 20:05.162
It's just that those girls--
well, they need me.

20:05.245 --> 20:08.248
Oh, I really missed
you guys.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.917
I can't wait
to come home.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.544
Ginger, there's something else
you should know

20:12.628 --> 20:15.881
about how you got into Avalanche
in the first place.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.341
Dodie.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.926
What is she talking about?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.762
{\an5}You got into
Avalanche on talent,
Ginger.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.306
{\an1}You're good enough
to be here,

20:24.389 --> 20:25.641
so remember that.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.685
And all the other stuff--
it doesn't really matter.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.729
We're proud of you.

20:30.812 --> 20:31.813
Oh, thanks.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.191
You guys are
the best.

20:34.274 --> 20:34.483
(<i> sighs</i> )

20:34.566 --> 20:36.485
{\an3}So...

20:36.568 --> 20:37.569
do I look any different?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.153
Yes, in fact.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.739
Your lip gloss
is smudged

20:40.822 --> 20:43.158
and it looks
like you've been...

20:43.241 --> 20:44.284
{\an1}Kissing!

20:44.368 --> 20:45.160
{\an3}Ginger!

20:45.243 --> 20:45.661
Who have you
been kissing?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.996
(<i> giggles</i> )

20:48.080 --> 20:51.333
Um... give you
a hint.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.668
It's, uh..

20:52.751 --> 20:54.252
(<i> Dodie and Macie squeal</i> )

21:00.717 --> 21:01.677
You guys want to go get
something

21:01.760 --> 21:03.679
from the snack car?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.889
Nah, we're okay.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.016
Say, Carl,

21:08.100 --> 21:10.477
{\an5}do you want to sit
next to Noelle
or something?

21:10.560 --> 21:11.520
I don't know.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.980
If you don't want to.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.572
(<i> giggling</i> )

21:26.910 --> 21:29.705
Um, I'll be right back.
