WEBVTT

03:23.161 --> 03:24.776
Put me the fuck down.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.292
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.086
Hungry?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.455
Mm, a little, yeah.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.507
What is "23"?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.183
It's a pencil.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.475
Don't get the wrong ones.
These are the ones I need.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.061
Do you really need all this
for your drawings?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.949
Hurry up, Sarah. Come on.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.458
- Sir.
- Yes?

05:36.503 --> 05:39.870
As of today, we still have not received
last month's payment.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.754
Without fail, this week.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.030
Come on.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.488
Let me go man! Oh! Fuck!

08:18.039 --> 08:20.872
- She spilled a fucking drink on me.
- Keep moving.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.784
Get off me!

08:27.799 --> 08:29.289
- Get the fuck off me!
- Calm down.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.673
I am fucking calm.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.085
- Stay here.
- Don't fucking touch me, man!

08:33.138 --> 08:34.628
You don't know who the fuck I am?

08:36.349 --> 08:40.183
Your sorry ass is gonna get in a lot of
trouble for this. For nothing!

08:40.227 --> 08:42.514
She's just a bitch. Like you!

08:57.954 --> 08:59.160
Oh, fuck, man.

09:00.331 --> 09:04.199
Lukas? Hey, Lukas, break out.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.235
The cops showed up.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.535
I tried to tell them
he beat up a waitress

09:44.584 --> 09:45.664
but they didn't want to hear it.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.952
I think the kid's going to
press charges.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.163
And... you're fired.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.127
Five years since I've known you.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.004
I know what's on your mind.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.679
Hope you won't get in more trouble
because of that cunt.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.724
What are you gonna do?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.305
I need to find a job.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.230
I may have a plan for you.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.025
There's a strip club in lxelles.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.486
One of the bar guys told me
they needed a bouncer.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.776
If you're interested, |'l| hook you up.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.098
I don't speak Flemish.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.679
Follow me.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.315
We open from Wednesday till Sunday.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.859
You gotta be focused,
cos there are naked girls

11:44.913 --> 11:47.529
so things can easily get fucked up
with the clients.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.867
No smoking, no drinking.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.707
You get paid every night.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.592
It's simple.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.303
Last man standing gets the job.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.674
Stop!

15:03.903 --> 15:06.645
- What's your name?
- Lukas.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.446
You start Friday.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.031
Who did that to you?

15:53.786 --> 15:54.741
A guy at work.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.160
Is it painful?

16:00.209 --> 16:01.073
A little bit.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.744
Did he hit you with his elbow?

16:12.930 --> 16:15.171
- Do you know what's great about this?
- What?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.012
I get to stay home tonight.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.307
This is hard.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.640
Wait, put your hand like this...

16:27.320 --> 16:28.605
...knife pointing down.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.738
Go on. Go on.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.553
See you tonight!

16:56.891 --> 16:57.755
Bye!

16:58.559 --> 16:59.799
I'm sorry for the delay.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.977
- Is everything OK?
- I'm fine.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.898
Police.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.740
We'd like to talk to you
about what happened at your job.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.199
Will you please come with us?

17:42.270 --> 17:45.307
So, what you're saying
is you didn't hit the guy?

17:47.692 --> 17:48.852
Is that right?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.321
You know what,
I got a 16 year—old kid.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.156
When I talk to him

18:08.004 --> 18:11.087
he's got all these crazy theories
about justice

18:11.132 --> 18:13.418
the planet, mankind...

18:13.467 --> 18:15.003
I just want to punch him in the face.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.086
Just so he knows
what it feels like.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.306
See if he still has the same opinions
about things afterwards.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.225
But you got bad luck, man.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.513
Cos the guy that you beat up,
his Dad works for the European Parliament.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.272
So that's where it gets tricky for you.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.559
Where we come in,
start sticking our noses in.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.740
That club you worked at

18:41.037 --> 18:42.277
they don't know
anything about you.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.653
You live alone with your daughter.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.413
She goes to school
under a fake last name.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.204
No one knows who you are
or why you're hiding.

18:51.047 --> 18:54.084
The only thing I know
is that your name is Lukas...

18:55.134 --> 18:58.342
You're a bouncer
and you beat the shit out of a kid.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.134
What do you want from me?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.637
I'm going to tell you what I don't want.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.892
I don't want to mess with you.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.722
If you're hiding because you screwed up
here or somewhere

19:10.775 --> 19:12.015
I don't give a fuck.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.101
But I want you to work for me.

19:17.198 --> 19:20.440
Now, you help me and I'll take care
of that nightclub shit you got yourself into.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.154
Hey, I don't work
for the Belgian police.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.575
I'm the kind of guy you call when
there's a big problem somewhere in Europe.

19:30.628 --> 19:34.086
Now my job is to track down a Dutchman
who settled here to run his business.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.630
What's his business?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.007
He prints fake money.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.927
So, now l have 20 fucking countries
on my back that want me to nail him.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.885
What do l have to do with that?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.847
This guy I'm talking about is
Jan Dekkers

19:49.980 --> 19:51.936
and he hired you as a bouncer
at his strip club.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.312
I want you to keep your eyes open,
you see anything, you call me.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.316
It's that simple.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.394
I'm not interested.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.032
I'm telling you.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.331
l have a lot of leeway
with the work that I do.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.375
Which means I can make sure
you have no problems with the justice.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.585
Or I can get a judge
to throw you in jail

20:19.385 --> 20:21.421
and send your daughter
to a foster home.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.927
And if you break out,
you'll be on every shit list.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.313
This is my number, memorise it.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.737
If you see or hear anything,
you call me.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.090
Where's Jan?

21:51.852 --> 21:52.716
He's busy.

22:37.523 --> 22:41.357
Do you think I'm gonna wait for Jan
all night long

22:41.402 --> 22:43.768
sitting here and drinking water?

22:45.447 --> 22:47.108
He can't make it tonight, he's sorry.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.028
Tell him to go and fuck himself.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.754
See that girl over there?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.384
Take her back to her hotel.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.387
Don't leave her alone one second.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.716
Make sure she's safe, OK?

23:18.689 --> 23:19.724
Come back here.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.988
What's your name?

23:35.956 --> 23:36.820
Lukas.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.082
You do everything
they tell you to do?

23:44.131 --> 23:45.667
Are you their little doggy?

24:55.953 --> 24:56.908
Basra!

25:13.637 --> 25:15.719
- She's Italian.
- Never heard of her.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.302
- How old is she?
- In her mid—thirties.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.676
Comes to the club,
doesn't pay for anything.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.891
Who is she? A new girlfriend?

25:25.774 --> 25:26.638
No idea.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.816
OK, I’m gonna check on that.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.524
This is good,
they're beginning to trust you.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.154
These guys don't trust anyone.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.194
Hey, even the Devil needs lieutenants.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.214
No touching.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.596
Get your hands off.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.153
Jan wants to see you.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.066
Outside.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.613
- Shhh.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.370
What do you want?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.586
We wanna know who you are.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.959
I am the bouncer at the strip club.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.732
You've only got one number
in your phone.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.154
Hello ?

27:48.917 --> 27:49.952
Hello, Daddy?

28:18.572 --> 28:19.527
Start the car.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.504
Where are you from?

28:41.053 --> 28:41.917
From here.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.130
Nobody knows you.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.590
Why?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.845
I was a bodyguard... abroad.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.055
Where about?

28:57.110 --> 28:57.974
South Africa.

29:00.781 --> 29:01.645
That's nice.

29:02.991 --> 29:03.980
Why did you come back?

29:06.036 --> 29:07.151
My wife died.

29:12.125 --> 29:12.989
Keep right.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.544
Come.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.006
You're a bodyguard, no?

30:18.066 --> 30:19.055
He's OK.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.647
So, you got some good news for me?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.318
They don't want to do business with you.

30:28.952 --> 30:29.816
Why?

30:31.246 --> 30:33.578
They are already in business
with some guys in the Netherlands...

30:35.334 --> 30:36.449
...and they don't trust you.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.075
Listen...

30:41.965 --> 30:43.045
I pre—sold everything...

30:44.426 --> 30:48.294
and now you tell me that I can't deliver
the product because of some Dutch fuck?

30:50.557 --> 30:52.843
- Don't blame it on me.
- I do blame it on you.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.266
You told me there wouldn't be a problem.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.401
They're Dutch for Christ's sake,
they're our fucking neighbours.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.395
You know what?

31:09.451 --> 31:10.691
Ask them what they want.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.660
I'll give it to them. Anything.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.576
So they know they can trust me.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.542
I'll work it out.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.753
Yeah... you'd better work it out.

31:30.055 --> 31:30.919
Let's go.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.974
This is where you live?

31:47.280 --> 31:48.144
Yeah.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.656
Your daughter... what's her name?

31:55.455 --> 31:56.319
Sarah.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.332
You leave her alone when you're at work?

32:04.256 --> 32:05.120
Yeah.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.624
You'd better go see her, then.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.591
Oh, wait.

32:15.559 --> 32:16.423
Keep the car.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.727
I don't need it.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.722
I'll go back with Geert.

32:24.401 --> 32:25.607
I'm telling you, keep it.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.392
It's my treat.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.905
Now they know where I live.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.120
The y ’re watching me.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.573
You're talking to me.
That means you passed the test.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.577
Jan went to talk to some middleman.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.372
An antique dealer,
he has a gallery in lxelles.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.291
He ’5‘ supposed to put him in touch
with some Dutch guys.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.208
What for?

33:33.261 --> 33:34.171
No idea.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.628
They have something he wants.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.723
Try to find out more about this.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.267
We were able to track down the Italian
girl you took to the hotel

33:46.316 --> 33:48.056
Lisa Zaccherini, charged with

33:48.151 --> 33:50.062
forgery in Home in 2013.

33:50.737 --> 33:51.601
lf Jan '5 brought her here

33:51.738 --> 33:53.194
from Italy, he's got a good reason.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.318
I want you to check on that.

34:11.632 --> 34:12.918
Hello?

34:12.967 --> 34:14.708
You drove Lisa back the other day.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.458
Yeah.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.969
Go get her at her hotel.

34:18.974 --> 34:19.838
When?

34:20.433 --> 34:21.467
Right now.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.683
OK.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.353
That was great, Dad, thank you.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.362
Can we go back riding tomorrow?

34:37.409 --> 34:39.149
We'll go back if it's possible.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.165
Ciao.

34:55.217 --> 34:56.081
Hello.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.211
- What is your name?
- Sarah.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.214
You're very pretty, Sarah.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.386
And you look much more friendly
than your father.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.976
- Where are we going?
- Take the Boulevard...

35:12.444 --> 35:14.150
I'll show you where to go next.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.212
It's done.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.304
OK.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.841
l’m gonna text you an address.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.343
Meet me there immediate/y.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.273
Who were you speaking with?

36:34.776 --> 36:35.856
Give me five minutes.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.370
Go inside. Geert is waiting for you.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.185
I've got something to fetch.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.277
That's all you need to know.

37:26.828 --> 37:27.738
When?

37:29.247 --> 37:30.111
Now.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.029
Daddw

37:53.605 --> 37:55.141
Woah!

37:59.819 --> 38:01.935
Tell him to bring back my daughter
right away.

38:05.575 --> 38:06.485
Do it...

38:07.410 --> 38:08.991
if you don't wanna see
your daughter again.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.626
If something happens to my daughter,
I'll kill you.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.584
You and your boss.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.795
OK?

38:44.113 --> 38:45.569
This is the guy we're coming to get.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.614
We're coming to get?

38:50.036 --> 38:53.278
Those motherfucking Dutchmen only want
to negotiate if we bring them this guy.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.704
He cooks the best crack cocaine
in Europe.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.494
He used to work for them.

38:58.545 --> 38:59.785
But he left to work on his own.

39:00.755 --> 39:01.835
So, what's the plan?

39:02.882 --> 39:05.749
What do you mean, what's the plan?
We go in and get him out.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.848
- How many people are there?
- No idea.

39:19.816 --> 39:24.230
So you think your best plan is to go in,
get him out and shoot whatever moves?

39:26.823 --> 39:28.233
You got a better fucking idea?

39:30.577 --> 39:31.532
You stay here.

44:29.417 --> 44:30.281
Fuck!

44:42.471 --> 44:45.884
Where's my daughter?
- Relax. She's safe.

45:02.658 --> 45:03.989
Your home is beautiful.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.114
It's not really my home.

45:12.168 --> 45:15.251
- Do you work with my dad?
- Not really.

45:18.174 --> 45:19.789
So, what's your job then?

45:24.972 --> 45:26.257
What's your daddy's job?

45:26.974 --> 45:28.339
He was a...

45:29.352 --> 45:31.308
He was a guard who protects people.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.473
- A bodyguard?
- Yes, that's it!

45:33.522 --> 45:37.014
He used to protect my mummy's father
when we lived in South Africa.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.308
That's how Mummy and Daddy met.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.352
Wow!

45:44.450 --> 45:46.111
And your mummy, where is she now?

45:47.245 --> 45:49.736
She had an accident in South Africa.

45:51.624 --> 45:52.613
An accident?

45:55.503 --> 45:58.040
Some people killed her to steal her car.

46:13.771 --> 46:14.806
- Where is she?
- She's fine.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.316
Dad, look what we did, Lisa and me.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.402
Get your stuff, we're leaving.

46:32.248 --> 46:33.658
Hurry up, come on.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.390
Excuse me for barging in.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.307
You gave me no choice.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.607
No more calls.
You never answer the phone.

47:02.194 --> 47:03.149
What happened?

47:04.488 --> 47:05.944
We went to kidnap a guy for Jan.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.397
What guy? What do they want him for?

47:09.410 --> 47:11.401
For the Dutch guys
they want to negotiate with.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.117
What does he want to negotiate exactly?

47:15.166 --> 47:16.372
I have no idea.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.327
Well, you find out.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.700
No, it's over. I'm out.

47:20.338 --> 47:23.080
They took my daughter,
this is going too far.

47:24.633 --> 47:25.497
OK.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.086
Hey, I know what you did
in South Africa.

47:31.474 --> 47:32.554
You know what that means?

47:33.851 --> 47:36.513
It means if you quit the game now,
I'll ship you right back there. Got it?

47:37.688 --> 47:39.349
Hey, you got it?

47:43.486 --> 47:44.692
Good.

47:44.737 --> 47:46.227
Don't lose it now, man.
We need you.

48:06.467 --> 48:09.334
Ha, you came back.

48:17.853 --> 48:18.717
You know?

48:21.065 --> 48:22.475
I'm sorry about the other day.

48:26.195 --> 48:28.686
I'm just a bit short handed lately.

48:31.742 --> 48:33.278
I knew you would do a good job.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.112
It's a compliment.

48:39.834 --> 48:40.869
It means I trust you.

48:44.296 --> 48:46.161
Don't ever touch my daughter again.

48:49.969 --> 48:50.833
I promise.

49:09.613 --> 49:10.819
For the inconvenience.

49:21.125 --> 49:22.160
I want to continue.

49:23.919 --> 49:26.001
We are open from Wednesday
through Sunday.

49:29.633 --> 49:30.588
I want more.

49:39.518 --> 49:41.634
Tomorrow we are trading
the guy you kidnapped.

49:45.357 --> 49:47.814
Do you think you can handle it,
together with Geert?

49:49.778 --> 49:50.642
Yeah.

50:32.321 --> 50:33.185
You can go.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.270
It's OK.

51:36.594 --> 51:37.834
You don't know
what you're doing.

51:38.721 --> 51:39.756
Shut up.

51:45.352 --> 51:46.762
You won't
get out of here alive.

51:50.816 --> 51:53.398
They'll kill me
and then they'll kill you.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.614
It's OK.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.649
No, no.

52:04.330 --> 52:05.194
No.

52:10.669 --> 52:11.909
No!

52:16.550 --> 52:17.790
Help! Help!

52:21.180 --> 52:23.512
Fuck!
Go, go, go!

55:42.047 --> 55:42.911
Hey.

55:49.429 --> 55:50.293
Go inside.

55:53.100 --> 55:53.964
Go.

55:58.105 --> 55:59.060
What the fuck happened?

56:04.945 --> 56:05.809
Shit!

56:47.988 --> 56:50.024
Sarah. Sarah.

56:51.366 --> 56:53.573
Come on. Hurry up.

56:54.161 --> 56:55.196
Bye!

57:05.964 --> 57:06.828
It's me.

57:06.882 --> 57:08.622
The supermarket?
Was that you too?

57:08.675 --> 57:10.836
We went there
for an exchange.

57:10.886 --> 57:12.171
What kind of exchange?

57:12.721 --> 57:13.756
Watermarked paper.

57:15.515 --> 57:17.051
That means they're going
to send a new batch out.

57:18.435 --> 57:19.595
There must be a lab somewhere.

57:19.645 --> 57:21.886
Maybe they move every time they go
into production, I don't know.

57:23.357 --> 57:24.722
Do they have doubts about you?

57:26.318 --> 57:27.273
Impossible.

57:28.695 --> 57:30.151
I risked my life for them.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.275
OK good, then you stay on it.

57:46.505 --> 57:48.166
Bring your pencils with you
if you want.

57:49.508 --> 57:50.372
OK?

58:12.197 --> 58:13.186
You'll be OK here.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.276
Omar is a super guy.

58:17.703 --> 58:20.194
And you and Moussa are
good friends, huh?

58:22.541 --> 58:25.203
Listen, l have a few things to finish.

58:29.089 --> 58:32.081
Honey, I promise I'll come back
to get you.

58:33.635 --> 58:34.670
Tell me.

58:36.430 --> 58:37.670
Are you afraid?

58:39.141 --> 58:40.096
A little bit.

58:42.936 --> 58:43.971
I am not afraid for you.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.287
Sure you don't need anything else?

59:10.005 --> 59:10.915
Positive.

59:10.964 --> 59:11.919
You know you can count on me.

59:13.050 --> 59:13.914
Bro?

59:15.677 --> 59:16.666
I will do this alone.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.903
I don't know, I haven't decided yet, and you?

59:38.575 --> 59:41.942
Me? I like skateboarding, riding my bike,
basketball...

59:42.704 --> 59:44.319
I think I'll take sports, you know.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.284
I'm not really a sports fan.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:04.802
The first time I saw you

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.600
you were beating up
a bunch of guys half your age.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.015
Do you know what I thought?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.232
"This guy is either totally fucked up...

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:18.486
or he's a fucking survivor
who is able to adapt to anything."

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.238
What do you think?

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:23.692
I don't know.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:26.698
It's a bit of both.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.493
I guess they go together.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.834
You do understand
what we are doing now...

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:33.743
with Lisa?

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:38.965
It's none of my business.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.001
It is...

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.214
After what you've done for me.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.425
Whether you like it or not.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.517
We are going to print bank notes
pretty soon.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:53.646
I'm going to need you.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.727
You've gotta take real good care of Lisa

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:01.529
she is...

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.023
fragile.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:05.738
Especially after what happened.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.358
I grew up somewhere near Crotone.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.103
Do you know where it is?

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.613
It's in the south of Italy.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.067
A poor region.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.240
But it's near by the sea.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.116
My father had a printing business.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:38.911
It was his whole life.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.582
When he passed away,
he left me and my mother in deep shit.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.005
I really needed money.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.047
So, I began to print fake money.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.550
Just to pay off my father's debts
in the first place.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:56.762
But, then I continued.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.141
You know for doing that

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.276
I could spend my life in prison.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.985
Do you think
we could have done something?

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:10.238
For Geert?

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.151
No.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.994
When you do these kind of things,
it always turns nasty.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.249
Same goes for you if you continue.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:24.797
And your wife, what happened to her?

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.927
A carjacking that got out of hand.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:31.717
They killed her.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.434
And did they find the people who did it?

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:39.895
The police didn't.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.895
But, I did.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.658
Can you drop me somewhere?

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.209
I'm telling you, there was nothing,
it was empty.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.745
Jan is going to disappear
now he knows we're after him.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.331
We still have a chance.

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:32.000
What's that?

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:36.383
Jan has to hurry to print and deliver
to his buyers.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.426
Just let the girl go.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.850
You're kidding me.
She's the only thing I've got here.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:47.348
Let me talk to her.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:54.397
OK, come on.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:26.642
Fig/i0 di putana/ You ratted on us.

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.063
Why did you do that?

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:31.434
For my daughter,
they have me on a leash.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:32.902
That's bullshit.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:33.944
But it's the truth.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:39.071
They'll let you out
so you can print the money.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.281
They have nothing on me. Nothing!

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.622
They know everything you do.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:46.916
They're on your back.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.461
You trust these bastards?

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:52.584
I don't have a choice.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.050
I've tried to protect you.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.891
No, no.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.677
You were trying to protect yourself.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.436
You and your family.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.059
You sacrificed me.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.667
Do you want to end up like Geert?

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:32.794
Is that it?

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.163
Non lo so.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.374
Is that what you want?

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:36.423
Non lo so.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:37.458
Look at me.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.003
Lisa...

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:48.762
We're gonna be fine.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.395
We're gonna be fine.

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.987
- OK?
- OK.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.515
What are you doing here?

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:35.942
I wanted to see you.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.236
We've got a big problem.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:41.481
How big?

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:43.817
As big as a police raid.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.658
They took Lisa.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.408
But, don't worry.
I talked to the attorney...

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.961
they've got nothing against her,
they'll have to let her go.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:56.955
So, we don't have a problem.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:00.625
Yes, we do.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:03.631
There is too much heat on us.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.716
Are you going to stop?

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:10.475
I can't.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:13.555
We have to print the money.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.979
The people I worked for paid for it.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:23.273
Come... Let's go for a ride.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.345
You are crazy.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.515
The police raided my place

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.146
and they arrested the girl
who works for me.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:00.477
What does it have to do with me?
I didn't tell the cops.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.024
The way I see it...

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.358
The transaction went wrong...

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:09.534
and the Dutch wanted
to take revenge on me.

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.489
If they wanted to take revenge on you

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:13.998
they wouldn't have sent the cops.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.368
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.830
Maybe it's the girl who ratted on you.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:25.543
No.

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:27.424
How can you be so sure?

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:31.015
Well, she knew we were moving the stash.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.180
Maybe it's him?

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.183
This gentleman over there...

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.851
he made his hands dirty for me.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.031
You see?

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:57.617
Once you have a doubt...

01:10:58.796 --> 01:10:59.660
It's over.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.091
Are we going far away?

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.213
I don't know.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.177
When are you coming back?

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.175
Very soon.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:17.970
I promise you.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:35.260
Come on, Lisa. Get your shit together.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.145
Get me these babies.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.058
Fuck.

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:41.160
- It's OK.
- OK.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.494
Thank you.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:38.967
Put it in the trunk.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.194
Buy some toys for your daughter.

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:04.655
Police!

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.159
Don't move!

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.703
Keep calm! Keep calm!

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:12.621
Drop the gun.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:16.046
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:21.380
On your knees.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.186
- Come on guys, pack everything.
- Woo hoo!

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.306
Yeah, this is payday!

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.414
Come on, move it. Hurry up.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.015
So, you're not dead yet?

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:12.992
Nico!

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:16.245
Nico!

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:18.580
Nico!

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.297
Nico!

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:14.511
Fuck!

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.561
Fuck!

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.401
Shit!

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:22.562
Hey!

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.850
Hello? Dad?

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:10.400
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.405
- Are you coming to get me?
- Yeah.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.658
Dad?
