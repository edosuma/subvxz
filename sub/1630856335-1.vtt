00:30.447 --> 00:34.284
[audience cheering and applauding]

01:21.289 --> 01:23.875
[audience cheering]

01:39.432 --> 01:40.308
[Dave] All right.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.021
Almost 24 years ago…

01:46.439 --> 01:49.651
it was the last time
I was on the stage in this room.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.862
[audience cheering]

01:52.946 --> 01:55.490
I was taping my first one-hour special.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.367
It was called Killin' Them Softly.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.331
My girlfriend
was sitting in that row, pregnant.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.041
She's now my wife.

02:10.004 --> 02:14.134
The baby that she was carrying,
my first child…

02:15.218 --> 02:17.178
I smoke weed with that nigga now.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.774
And what I remember most
about that night was the pressure.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.318
Before the show,
I had to run out on the avenue

02:32.402 --> 02:34.571
and hand out tickets
to anybody who would take 'em

02:34.654 --> 02:36.865
'cause I couldn't even fill
the fucking room.

02:37.574 --> 02:42.078
And, boy, what a difference
24 short years makes.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.047
And right before that time,
my father had died.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.466
He never lived to see me do it.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.596
And when he died, I was inconsolable.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.432
I thought I'd never smile or laugh again.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.727
And the only thing
that got me out of that space

03:05.810 --> 03:09.397
was a comedian friend of mine,
the late, great Norm MacDonald.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.443
That's right, shout out for Norm.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.196
And what Norm did,
which I'll never forget,

03:17.280 --> 03:19.866
as he knew that I was the biggest
Jim Carrey fan in the world.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.200
I'm not gonna go into it,

03:21.284 --> 03:25.204
but Jim Carrey is talented in a way
that you can't practice or rehearse.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.249
What a God-given talent.
I was fascinated with him.

03:28.791 --> 03:32.170
And Norm knew that. He called me up,
and he goes, "Dave, I'm…"

03:32.253 --> 03:34.672
He says, "I'm doing
a movie with Jim Carrey…"

03:35.965 --> 03:39.636
"Do you want to meet him?"
And I said, "Fuck, yes, I do."

03:39.719 --> 03:44.140
It was the first time I could remember,
since my father died, being excited.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.937
And the movie was called Man on the Moon.
I didn't know any of this.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.440
In this movie, Jim Carrey
was playing another comedian I admired.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.150
The late, great Andy Kaufman.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.239
Yes, and Jim Carrey
was so immersed in that role,

03:59.322 --> 04:01.407
that from the moment he woke up,

04:01.491 --> 04:04.494
to the time he went to bed at night,
he would live his life

04:05.161 --> 04:06.913
as Andy Kaufman.

04:06.996 --> 04:07.956
I didn't know that.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.333
When they said, "Cut,"
this nigga was still…

04:12.126 --> 04:13.002
Andy Kaufman.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.757
So much so that everybody
on the crew called him Andy.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.134
I didn't know that.
I just went to meet him.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.846
When he walked into the room
we were to meet, I screamed, "Jim Carrey!"

04:23.930 --> 04:25.473
And everyone said, "No!"

04:28.434 --> 04:30.061
"Call him Andy."

04:31.229 --> 04:32.480
And I didn't understand.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.566
He came over and was acting weird.
I didn't know he was acting like Kaufman.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.987
Just like, "Hey, how you doing?"
And I was like, "Hello…

04:42.115 --> 04:42.949
Andy?"

04:44.826 --> 04:45.660
Now…

04:46.286 --> 04:49.247
in hindsight, how fucking lucky am I

04:49.330 --> 04:51.916
that I got to see one
of the greatest artists of my time

04:52.000 --> 04:55.295
immersed in one of
his most challenging processes ever?

04:55.378 --> 04:57.088
Very lucky to have seen that.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.799
But as it was happening…

05:02.218 --> 05:03.428
I was very disappointed.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.932
Because I wanted to meet Jim Carrey,

05:09.350 --> 05:13.896
and I had to pretend
this nigga was Andy Kaufman all afternoon.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.983
It was clearly Jim Carrey.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.986
I could look at him
and I could see he was Jim Carrey.

05:20.862 --> 05:25.700
Anyway, I say all that to say…
that's how trans people make me feel.

05:39.922 --> 05:40.882
Here we go.

05:45.219 --> 05:48.306
Now, if you guys came here
to this show tonight…

05:52.018 --> 05:54.729
thinking that I'm gonna make fun
of those people again,

05:56.105 --> 05:57.815
you've come to the wrong show.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.944
I'm not fucking with those people anymore.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.530
It wasn't worth the trouble.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.200
I ain't saying shit about them.

06:07.283 --> 06:10.453
Maybe three or four times tonight,
but that is it.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.666
Tired of talking about them.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.796
You wanna know
why I'm tired of talking about 'em?

06:19.879 --> 06:24.050
Because these people acted
like I needed them to be funny.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.426
Well, that's ridiculous.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.554
I don't need you.
I've got a whole new angle.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.723
You guys will never see this shit coming.

06:31.599 --> 06:35.186
I ain't doing trans jokes no more.
Know what I'mma do tonight? Tonight…

06:35.895 --> 06:37.855
I'm doing all handicapped jokes.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.860
Well, they're not
as organized as the gays.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.738
And I love punching down.

06:46.489 --> 06:50.868
There's probably a handicap in the back
'cause that's where they make them sit.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.005
"I came here to laugh
at transgender people."

07:04.090 --> 07:06.926
"I didn't know this nigga
was gonna make jokes about us."

07:07.301 --> 07:09.887
"Come on, y'all,
Let's get the fuck up out of here."

07:19.605 --> 07:22.525
Yeah, it's about time
somebody let these handicaps have it.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.404
Nigga met their match tonight. Fuck 'em.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.157
One time I was on Capitol Hill,

07:30.741 --> 07:32.618
and I seen a handicapped congressman.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.956
-Madison Cawthorn, that's his name.
-[woman] Oh!

07:41.961 --> 07:44.046
He's a Republican from North Carolina.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.673
And he was shocked

07:45.756 --> 07:48.134
'cause I saw him and I go,
"Hello, Congressman."

07:48.217 --> 07:50.636
He didn't even know
I knew who he was. He turned…

07:53.473 --> 07:54.807
Then I just walked away.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.811
I wanted him to see me
do something he couldn't do.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.315
I skipped.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.153
That nigga was mad.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.538
He's no longer a congressman.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.291
I don't know if you follow politics.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.336
I'm not trying
to be funny, but he lost his seat.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.674
He ran a bad race.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.095
Oh, buddy, yes, he did.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.264
You know what he did wrong?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.766
He was running for Congress again,

08:36.849 --> 08:38.893
and this motherfucker
tried to be controversial.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.938
He was on all them right wing podcast
talking all that shit.

08:42.021 --> 08:46.651
He was like,
"Washington is worse than Hollywood."

08:46.734 --> 08:48.194
I was at home, like, "What?"

08:49.445 --> 08:51.447
He said, "These people are disgusting."

08:51.531 --> 08:54.492
"They have orgies
and sex parties and drug parties."

08:54.575 --> 08:57.537
And I was thinking, "This nigga
sounds like Juicy Smoo-yay."

09:01.749 --> 09:02.583
He's lying.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.712
Now, I don't doubt that they do
this kind of shit in Washington,

09:06.796 --> 09:09.006
but I doubt he's seen it
with his own eyes.

09:10.341 --> 09:14.512
Because who the fuck invites
a paraplegic to an orgy?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.641
So this nigga can roll around
and snitch on everybody?

09:19.725 --> 09:20.601
[mouthing]

09:31.862 --> 09:34.824
I said there's only one reason
you gonna invite him to an orgy.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.409
And you know what that is.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.619
"Have at it, guys, I can't feel anything."

09:39.579 --> 09:41.831
"Let's get this bill passed for America."

09:41.914 --> 09:43.332
"One at a time, folks."

09:48.504 --> 09:49.589
Oh, buddy.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.843
Yep, yep, yep.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.888
The other handicaps are the new people
I punch down on.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.307
To be honest with you,

10:00.516 --> 10:03.769
I've been trying to repair my relationship
with the transgender community.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.731
'Cause I don't want them
to think that I don't like them.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.568
You know how I've been repairing it?
I wrote a play.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.821
I did. 'Cause I know that gays love plays.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.160
It's a very sad play, but it's moving.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.330
It's about a Black transgender woman

10:23.372 --> 10:25.625
whose pronoun is, sadly, nigga.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.633
It's a tear-jerker.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.554
At the end of the play,
she dies of loneliness

10:38.638 --> 10:41.307
'cause white liberals
don't know how to speak to her.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.476
Sad.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.189
Speaking of nigga…

10:49.482 --> 10:52.234
I've also been working
on a book, and this is true.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.405
I'm rewriting the American Classic,
Huckleberry Finn,

10:57.698 --> 10:59.241
from Nigger Jim's perspective.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.329
It's called The Adventures of Nigger Jim.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.665
That's how it starts.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.376
Huckleberry Finn walks up
to him and goes, "You're Nigger Jim."

11:08.459 --> 11:10.920
And he's like, "Yo, I just said 'Jim.'"

11:13.714 --> 11:15.549
"What's your name, little buddy?"

11:15.633 --> 11:17.885
"Huckleberry Finn is my name."

11:17.968 --> 11:21.680
"What? Huckleberry?
That's your real name?"

11:21.764 --> 11:22.765
"God-given."

11:23.724 --> 11:25.267
[exhales] "You know what?"

11:26.352 --> 11:28.104
"Just call me Nigger Jim, it's fine."

11:31.899 --> 11:35.277
I don't care if you
are Black or White or whatever.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.988
If you ever meet
a white person named Huckleberry,

11:39.156 --> 11:40.533
he has less money than you.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.372
That is the white trashiest name
I've ever heard in my fucking life.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.417
If you have a name like Huckleberry,
you're doomed to fail.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.129
If I was in court
and my lawyer came up like,

11:53.212 --> 11:57.633
"I am your attorney, Huckleberry Finn."
I'd be like, "Uh-oh, I'm going to jail."

12:00.678 --> 12:02.430
God forbid I ever go to jail.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.225
But if I do, I hope it's in California.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.187
Soon as the judge sentence me,
I'll be like, "Before you sentence me,

12:10.271 --> 12:11.564
I want the court to know…

12:12.398 --> 12:14.024
I identify as a woman."

12:16.235 --> 12:19.447
"Send me… to a woman's jail."

12:22.199 --> 12:24.785
As soon I get in there,
you know what I'mma be doing.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.872
"Give me your fruit cocktail, bitch,
before I knock your teeth out."

12:27.955 --> 12:29.999
"I'm a girl, just like you, bitch."

12:31.792 --> 12:35.504
"Come here and suck this girl dick I got.
Don't make me explain myself."

12:56.692 --> 12:59.945
You know, I have
a great reputation in show business,

13:00.029 --> 13:04.658
but in comedy,
I'm what's known as a lazy comedian.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.704
Which is crazy 'cause I work all the time,
but that's not why they call me lazy.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.040
They call me lazy
'cause I do shows sometimes…

13:11.123 --> 13:14.668
Twenty thousand people be
in the crowd, and I'll tell a joke,

13:14.752 --> 13:17.087
and they'll all look at me like I'm crazy.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.090
But three or four people
will laugh really hard.

13:21.091 --> 13:24.011
And I'll be on stage like,
"Yeah, that's good enough."

13:31.143 --> 13:33.562
Well, this next joke
is one of those jokes that--

13:35.648 --> 13:38.817
You know what I mean?
I like to tell it, but it never does good.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.403
But I'm gonna do it.
Know what I don't do good?

13:41.487 --> 13:44.198
I'm not good at impressions,
but this is an impression.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.991
You ready? Okay.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.786
This is not gonna work.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.747
A'ight, this is my impression.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.875
It's my impression… [exhales]

13:57.670 --> 13:59.463
of the dead people on the Titanic.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.344
You didn't let me finish.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.848
This is my impression
of the dead people on the Titanic,

14:09.932 --> 14:12.393
as the submersible
was approaching their ship.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.360
That's good enough.
All right, here it goes.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.247
I… Okay, here it goes.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.462
[trilling voice] Come join us
in our watery grave.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.721
[normal voice] Oh, buddy,
that's funny to me.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.057
Listen, that is a funny way to die.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.561
Twenty years from now,
on my 70th birthday,

14:55.644 --> 14:58.397
I'm gonna take
a submersible to see the submersible.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.151
Hopefully by then it should work.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.072
My wife hates that joke. You know…

15:08.365 --> 15:13.287
Do you know there's a strip club
in D.C. called Camelot?

15:14.455 --> 15:16.165
[audience whooping]

15:16.248 --> 15:19.001
-Is that still open?
-[audience] Yes!

15:19.084 --> 15:21.879
I know what I'm doing
after the show. I gotta tell you…

15:23.088 --> 15:25.174
the other day, my wife called me creepy.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.761
You know, I frequent strip clubs.
It's something I like to do.

15:28.844 --> 15:33.766
And my wife said I was creepy
'cause I go to strip clubs by myself.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.226
Is that creepy?

15:38.270 --> 15:41.607
I think that's better
than going with the fellas.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.776
That's creepy to me.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.694
"Hey, let's all go to the strip club

15:45.778 --> 15:48.530
and get our dicks hard together
as a group of friends."

15:50.866 --> 15:53.077
"Drive home in a quiet car
and not talk about

15:53.160 --> 15:55.162
any of the things we've seen or done."

15:56.288 --> 15:58.999
No, nigga, I go by myself.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.837
But my wife doesn't understand
why I go to the strip club.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.547
It has nothing to do with sex.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.842
I need a pinch of sexual energy
in the room to relax,

16:08.926 --> 16:10.678
but it's more about being out.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.596
I like the music.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.934
A few naked chicks
in there makes me feel good,

16:17.017 --> 16:19.436
but I'm not trying
to socialize or meet anybody.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.147
Sometimes I go to a strip club
and I bring a book.

16:23.607 --> 16:27.152
I do, and I sit right by the stage
'cause the reading light is better.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.992
[mouthing]

16:42.292 --> 16:44.878
One time I went to a strip club,
and this is weird,

16:44.962 --> 16:46.130
I don't know why…

16:46.880 --> 16:49.883
The stripper, for some reason,
told me her real name.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.678
I know. So I left.

16:54.513 --> 16:58.017
She's like, "Where are you going?"
I was like, "Good night, Deborah."

17:04.940 --> 17:07.693
God bless her,
but my wife is mistaken about my life.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.571
She told me once she thinks my job is fun.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.074
My job is a job.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.909
I'm fun.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.414
It's too dangerous, man.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.000
You know, all last year…

17:24.543 --> 17:28.213
I was touring with,
arguably one of the greatest,

17:28.297 --> 17:31.759
if not the greatest living comedian,
Chris Rock.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.844
Me and him toured all year last year.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.683
And right before that tour started,

17:41.560 --> 17:45.731
Chris was involved in what we Blacks
might even consider a goddamn 9/11.

17:49.818 --> 17:55.032
Chris got slapped in the face
at the Oscars… by Will Smith,

17:55.115 --> 17:57.743
which was one of
the craziest things I'd ever seen.

17:57.826 --> 18:01.580
In fact, if you watch it live
on television, like I did,

18:01.663 --> 18:03.999
when it happened, I thought it was fake.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.169
I did, and I wasn't sure.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.755
So, I waited 'cause unlike you,
I know Chris.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.673
I waited 30, 40 minutes.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.384
As long as it'll take him
to get to another party.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.387
And I called him on FaceTime
and he picked up.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.265
Soon as he picked up, he said,

18:20.349 --> 18:22.851
"Yous the only nigga
I'd answer the phone for."

18:24.061 --> 18:25.521
Apparently, Obama and Oprah,

18:25.646 --> 18:28.649
everybody called this nigga
to see if everything's all right.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.864
And I thought it was fake.
I didn't know. So I asked.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.367
I go, "Well, you know." He said, "What?"

18:38.450 --> 18:40.119
I said, "Did it hurt?"

18:41.912 --> 18:44.248
He said, "Yes, nigga, it hurt."

18:46.542 --> 18:48.377
And then I knew that it was real.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.547
And then, and only then, was I offended.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.051
I wasn't just offended he got slapped.
That was only half of it.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.970
The offensive part
was after he slapped him,

18:58.053 --> 19:00.764
Will just sat down
and enjoyed the rest of his evening.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.015
It was crazy. He was…

19:03.809 --> 19:04.977
[mouthing] "Thank you."

19:07.980 --> 19:09.815
What the fuck is this?

19:11.942 --> 19:16.071
And then all year we was touring,
and I couldn't wait to see

19:16.155 --> 19:19.324
what he was going to say
in his special about this slap.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.910
I told him all year,
but the night he taped his special--

19:21.994 --> 19:23.829
Chris is one of these guys who's crafty.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.123
You never know
what he's gonna say until he says it.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.000
I went to see him tape his special.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.085
He taped it up the street, in Baltimore.

19:30.169 --> 19:36.383
Now, you guys are from D.C.,
so you know about Baltimore?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.430
We all know that through the years,

19:41.513 --> 19:44.850
D.C. has been through
some very, very tough times.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.896
Sadly, Baltimore
is still in a very tough time.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.278
Not everybody in the world really
can understand the depth of Baltimore.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.864
Baltimore is so desperate that…

20:01.158 --> 20:05.954
Tupac and his mother moved from Baltimore
to Oakland for a better life.

20:14.963 --> 20:18.008
And Chris Rock went so hard on the paint.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.887
And I can't believe he did this.
He shocked a Baltimore crowd.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.640
I didn't know that was possible.
I started doing comedy here.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.559
Shocked 'em. And you know
what he said that got 'em?

20:27.643 --> 20:30.479
He looked at the crowd--
I didn't expect him to say this.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.232
He looked the crowds.
All Black. Baltimore Black.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.530
Even if you rich and Black in Baltimore,

20:40.614 --> 20:43.200
you know them niggas
is traumatized about something.

20:44.368 --> 20:49.081
Chris shocked them. This is what he said.
He went to that crowd. He said…

20:49.164 --> 20:55.420
"I refuse to be a victim."
The crowd said… [gasps]

20:57.089 --> 21:00.676
And I was backstage looking like,
"Nigga watch the tape."

21:13.563 --> 21:15.607
I know it's fucked up,
but I tell you the truth,

21:15.691 --> 21:18.986
you know, everything's funny.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.363
Everything's funny 'til it happens to you.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.492
Three months. A mere three months

21:25.575 --> 21:28.328
after that terrible attack
that Chris Rock endured…

21:29.997 --> 21:32.207
I was on stage at the Hollywood Bowl.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.334
And a lunatic…

21:36.336 --> 21:38.380
jumped out of the crowd and attacked me.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.967
I got to tell you, if it happens to you,
you don't know what happened.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.260
It was like slow motion.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.429
I don't know this nigga…
I just looked and said,

21:45.512 --> 21:48.140
"Oh, my God. I'm being attacked."

21:49.349 --> 21:53.687
And this motherfucker was ragged.
He jumped me like, "Aah!"

21:55.814 --> 21:57.065
I'm old, but I'm fast.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.484
I caught this motherfucker's head
with my hand

21:59.568 --> 22:01.695
and pulled his hoodie over his eyes.

22:01.778 --> 22:07.326
I can still feel his head in my hand.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.786
It was spongy.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.623
He had been growing dreadlocks.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.918
Not the beautiful dreads
that Rastafarians grow.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.130
These were accidental
L.A. homeless dreads.

22:20.839 --> 22:24.343
This shit had leaves and sticks
and bottle caps and shit in it.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.594
Some kind of grease.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.512
I was like, "Ugh!" Like this.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.222
And then I fell down.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.475
He knocked me all the way on the ground.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.102
I was like,
"Man, this is a bad situation."

22:34.186 --> 22:36.563
"I don't know if I'm going to die
or what's gonna happen."

22:36.646 --> 22:39.024
But in that moment of vulnerability,

22:39.107 --> 22:42.611
you know what occurred to me that it never
occurred to me before in my life?

22:42.694 --> 22:45.405
In that moment,
it occurred to me

22:46.865 --> 22:48.325
that bodyguards…

22:50.118 --> 22:54.790
should not wear dress shoes to work!

22:54.873 --> 22:55.791
Travis!

22:57.959 --> 23:00.378
This nigga, Travis,
came out slipping and sliding

23:00.462 --> 23:04.132
in some kind of beautiful loafer
and fell flat on the back.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.886
I said, "Oh, my God.
Now both of us are down."

23:07.969 --> 23:09.846
"I gotta handle this shit myself."

23:09.930 --> 23:13.391
I popped right back… And the kid
that knocked me down, he popped up.

23:13.475 --> 23:18.271
And we looked at each other and realized,
same time, I was bigger than him.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.566
And that motherfucker took off running.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.194
I started to chase him,
and I said, "Eh, fuck him."

23:25.112 --> 23:26.863
I picked the microphone up.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.741
Said, "I'm gonna finish this show now."

23:30.867 --> 23:31.868
That's right.

23:38.125 --> 23:42.504
For three months before that,
I had been making fun of Chris Rock.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.340
And people would ask me all the time.

23:45.423 --> 23:48.176
They say, "Dave, what would you do
if you were Chris Rock

23:48.260 --> 23:50.470
and Will Smith slapped you in the face?"

23:50.554 --> 23:54.891
And to this day, the answer is the same.
"I don't know what I would have done."

23:54.975 --> 23:57.394
I've never been
in a situation that extreme.

23:58.478 --> 24:02.274
But I do know now
what Will Smith would not have done.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.236
And that is,
enjoy the rest of his evening.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.117
Man, listen.

24:14.035 --> 24:16.830
We gave that kid a good wallop.
We was whooping his ass.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.833
Not "we." I was on stage
trying to think of a joke to tell,

24:19.916 --> 24:23.587
but they was beating this nigga up
right behind me. Everybody could see it.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.797
Everybody could see it.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.550
I'm sitting up there
trying to think of what to say.

24:28.633 --> 24:32.429
I'm tongue tied. Me, of all people,
can't think of anything to say.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.597
Look at my karma.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.724
That moment,
of all the people in the world,

24:35.807 --> 24:38.560
Chris Rock walks from backstage.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.564
Walks up to me
in front of 20,000 people,

24:43.440 --> 24:46.902
grabs the mic out of my hands
and looks at the crowd and goes,

24:47.944 --> 24:49.446
"Was that Will Smith?"

24:52.991 --> 24:56.912
Man, motherfuckers
fell out of their chairs, laughing.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.458
I was standing there looking stupid.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.710
I was fucking furious.

25:03.793 --> 25:07.297
'Cause I'm thinking in my mind,
"Nigga, this is my attack."

25:09.633 --> 25:13.178
"You got attacked three months ago.
Now you have jokes?"

25:15.096 --> 25:18.308
So, I snatched the mic back from Chris
and tried to get one off,

25:18.391 --> 25:20.560
but my shit did not go good at all.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.021
I didn't know-- I was like,
"It was a trans man."

25:23.104 --> 25:24.689
And the crowd was like…

25:25.482 --> 25:29.569
"Boo. This is L.A.,
we like trans people. Boo."

25:31.071 --> 25:32.739
I know, I felt so bad.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.242
I felt so bad.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.119
But I know why he did it.

25:38.703 --> 25:42.999
You'd have to be there to understand,
but, man, when that guy tackled me,

25:43.083 --> 25:46.044
it was like a movie or something.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.587
You gotta picture this.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.339
Picture a famous person you like.

25:49.422 --> 25:52.801
Every famous person
you could imagine was at that show.

25:52.884 --> 25:56.304
It was, like, the biggest night
that Hollywood had ever seen.

25:57.347 --> 26:01.142
And when that guy tackled me,
he cleared the bleachers.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.646
I had to watch the tape afterwards
to know this happened,

26:04.729 --> 26:06.231
but as soon as he tackled me,

26:06.314 --> 26:10.110
Jamie Foxx was the first motherfucker
that jumped out of the crowd.

26:10.193 --> 26:13.863
He was wearing a white cowboy hat,
like, he knew this was going to happen.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.368
Never seen this nigga
in a cowboy hat before.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.830
And Jamie started chasing
that motherfucker

26:21.913 --> 26:23.373
around like Any Given Sunday.

26:23.456 --> 26:27.544
And that kid was fast.
His shit was juking and shaking.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.380
And it broke Jamie's ankles,
and he just kept running.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.508
Then Jon Stewart, from the Daily Show,
ran from backstage

26:33.591 --> 26:36.761
and jumped at this motherfucker
like Super Jew. He was, like…

26:40.890 --> 26:44.602
The kid's seen Jon coming, so he jumped
back and Jon went flying that way.

26:44.686 --> 26:48.356
This kid was fast. Then he turned around,
he sees the emergency exit,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.567
he starts running for the emergency exit.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.610
Just before he got to the door,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.364
motherfucking Puff Daddy
from Bad Boy Records

26:56.448 --> 26:59.200
jumped in front of the door.
That nigga was like, "Eh-eh, eh-eh."

27:04.080 --> 27:05.081
Boy…

27:07.000 --> 27:08.543
Puffy got that motherfucker.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.129
Then every celebrity ran out

27:11.212 --> 27:13.423
'cause every celebrity
saw themselves in me,

27:13.506 --> 27:16.009
and they started beating
the fuck out of that kid.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.263
And I know Chris was backstage
looking like, "Nobody helped me."

27:25.185 --> 27:29.564
♪ Everybody Hates Chris! ♪

27:43.036 --> 27:45.997
Look, it was way more intense
than what you guys might have read.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.540
I don't know what you read,

27:49.209 --> 27:51.252
but the kid,
while we was beating on him,

27:51.336 --> 27:55.215
reached in his waistband,
pulled out 22-caliber pistol.

27:55.298 --> 27:56.591
That shit was mayhem.

27:56.674 --> 28:01.346
Everybody started screaming,
"Oh, my God, he's got a gun."

28:01.429 --> 28:04.557
And then I got scared.
I was in the back, but I was scared.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.477
'Cause I knew that everybody
that was with me, was armed.

28:08.186 --> 28:13.566
Yes, if they had shot and killed this kid
on stage at the Hollywood Bowl…

28:13.650 --> 28:15.902
like I pay you to do, Travis…

28:25.036 --> 28:26.079
But Travis G-ed up.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.289
Travis wrestled the gun
out of the kid's hand.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.918
Then he took it like this and tried
to chamber the round and he couldn't.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.462
So he pulled the trigger
and it wasn't a gun.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.631
A knife blade popped out of the front.

28:36.714 --> 28:38.716
I guess this kid was going to stab me.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.009
That's some scary shit.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.679
So the next night,
even though I didn't have a show,

28:42.762 --> 28:45.765
I said, "I got to get back on stage."
I went and did a show.

28:46.975 --> 28:51.187
And someone in the audience screamed out,
"Dave, what happened with the attack?"

28:52.355 --> 28:55.066
And I didn't know
there was a journalist in the room.

28:56.401 --> 29:01.614
All I said was that this nigga
had a knife that identified as a gun.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.496
I got six more weeks
of bad press for that joke.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.416
I didn't even do nothing to this nigga.
That's not right.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.792
That was not right.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.465
And then the New York Post
went to the jail

29:18.548 --> 29:21.426
and interviewed my attacker
like he was some kind of hero.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.137
And I read that interview.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.056
It turns out
the entire attack was my fault.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.684
Yes, I triggered him.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.852
I didn't mean to.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.230
I had done jokes about the homeless.

29:34.939 --> 29:38.276
It turns out… this young man
was homeless.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.820
And, I mean, there's no way
I could've known this.

29:40.904 --> 29:41.946
But I will say…

29:44.449 --> 29:47.911
for a homeless guy,
this nigga had incredible seats.

29:57.712 --> 30:03.009
Oh, and they said I triggered them
because I had done LBGTQ jokes.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.470
And it turns out this fellow was a B.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.351
That was the headline
in the article that said,

30:11.434 --> 30:14.813
"Dave Chappelle's alleged attacker
is bisexual."

30:14.896 --> 30:17.273
I said, "alleged attacker"?

30:18.733 --> 30:22.320
This motherfucker definitely attacked me.
I'll show you the tape.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.489
He's allegedly bisexual.

30:26.199 --> 30:30.495
I'll need to see him suck somebody's dick
before I believe the rest of this article.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.376
I read that shit in the paper.
I was horrified.

30:36.459 --> 30:39.212
I was like, "Bisexual?
I could have been raped."

30:48.263 --> 30:50.515
No. You know what, though?

30:50.598 --> 30:52.475
It's not funny because…

30:54.435 --> 30:56.437
Because after all that madness ensued,

30:58.565 --> 31:00.066
I went to the hotel room.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.863
I was by myself, and I opened the door,
and my wife was in there alone.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.615
She was sobbing. Like sobbing.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.369
I said, "My God, what's wrong with you?
Bitch, did you get attacked, too?"

31:16.875 --> 31:18.167
And she's crying.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.004
She said, "Oh, my God, Dave."

31:21.921 --> 31:24.591
She said, "If you had died tonight…

31:28.177 --> 31:30.054
me and the kids would have nothing."

31:38.187 --> 31:39.731
Then I knew it was serious.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.691
So I sat down on the bed next to her.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.027
I reached in my pocket,
I pulled some keys out

31:44.110 --> 31:45.653
that she'd never seen before.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.156
She's like, "Oh!"

31:48.239 --> 31:49.949
"What are those keys?"

31:50.033 --> 31:52.410
And I gently placed them in her hands.

31:53.202 --> 31:57.832
I said, "Sweetheart, those are
the keys to my safe deposit box."

31:59.083 --> 32:02.670
"God forbid anything ever happen to me."

32:02.754 --> 32:05.590
"But if it does,
don't even worry about it."

32:05.673 --> 32:08.801
"You and the kids
have everything you need in that box."

32:08.885 --> 32:10.511
"I've already taken care of it."

32:11.304 --> 32:13.473
And she was looking at them keys.

32:13.556 --> 32:17.769
And I could see her mind realize
what we were actually talking about.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.356
And then she just started crying harder.

32:21.439 --> 32:24.525
And to be honest with you,
that made me cry a little bit, too.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.362
And we hugged each other real tight.

32:34.369 --> 32:37.664
Do you know this bitch looked in the box
while I'm alive and well?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.294
Who does that?

32:44.587 --> 32:45.797
Oh, my God.

32:46.589 --> 32:47.924
And then she was mad at me.

32:48.007 --> 32:51.386
She said, "Goddamn it, David.
I opened that box." I said, "You did?"

32:52.637 --> 32:55.640
She said, "Yes, I did,
and there was nothing in there."

33:00.478 --> 33:02.021
I said, "Nothing?"

33:06.109 --> 33:08.528
She said,
"Nothing except your stupid joke book."

33:08.611 --> 33:10.947
I was like, "Phew."

33:11.990 --> 33:13.491
I said, "Well, sweetie, look."

33:14.117 --> 33:16.661
"If you tell those jokes
exactly how they're written,

33:16.744 --> 33:18.496
you and the kids should be fine."

33:19.831 --> 33:21.249
"They're really good jokes."

33:29.132 --> 33:31.300
She's like,
"Good jokes? What is this shit?"

33:31.384 --> 33:33.428
"'Come join me in my watery grave.'"

33:33.511 --> 33:35.096
No. You gotta roll your throat.

33:35.179 --> 33:39.517
[trilling voice]
Come join me in my watery grave.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.901
Oh, boy.

33:49.861 --> 33:50.862
Oh, boy.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.198
I have been married a long time.

33:55.366 --> 33:59.787
I have. You know, I talk a lot of shit
about my wife, but I love her very much.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.832
In fact, you know,
you guys wouldn't believe this about me.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.542
I'm a jealous husband.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.253
It's true.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.382
Let me tell you something. One time
I thought my wife was cheating on me.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.967
Yes, nigga. Yes.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.389
That was one of
the worst days of my fucking life.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.682
I couldn't take it.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.643
And I'm embarrassed about it now,
but I can talk about it.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.812
You know what I did?

34:24.896 --> 34:27.440
It's fucked up.
But I did do this. I waited.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.401
I waited for her to fall asleep.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.112
And I waited a long time.

34:34.697 --> 34:35.656
She's Asian.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.868
I couldn't tell if she was asleep or not.
I was looking at her…

34:50.129 --> 34:52.924
And when I was sure she was asleep,
you know what I did?

34:53.549 --> 34:54.926
I stole the iPhone.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.970
Took it downstairs,
started trying out passwords

34:58.054 --> 34:59.347
to see if I could open it.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.848
I couldn't figure out the password.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.018
Then I remembered, it's an iPhone.
This shit has facial recognition.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.103
I was just like…

35:09.482 --> 35:11.109
And that shit opened right up.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.040
And I saw a text message in there
from a fellow named Earl.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.750
I don't know anybody named Earl.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.503
I woke her up out of her sleep.

35:30.586 --> 35:33.464
I said, "Wake the fuck up!
Who the fuck is Earl?"

35:33.548 --> 35:36.801
She said, "What are you talking about?"
"Don't you play dumb with me, bitch!"

35:36.884 --> 35:39.387
"I done open your phone. Who is Earl?"

35:39.470 --> 35:42.056
She's like, "Oh, my God, David."

35:43.224 --> 35:45.601
"That's gay Earl from the hair salon."

35:45.685 --> 35:47.436
I said, "Word. What am I, a dummy?"

35:47.520 --> 35:49.772
"How am I supposed
to know this nigga is gay?"

35:50.648 --> 35:55.069
And she was calm. She said,
"Read his texts and look at his pictures."

35:55.903 --> 35:57.530
I started reading them texts.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.282
Hmm.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.995
"This fellow sure
does spell girl with a 'u' a lot."

36:07.832 --> 36:11.335
And I switched over and looked
at his pictures and I couldn't believe it.

36:11.419 --> 36:15.131
This fellow looked gay in still pictures.
His mouth was open in every shot.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.722
And then I knew she was telling the truth.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.391
And then I felt, like, dumb.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.934
I said, "I'm sorry."

36:27.685 --> 36:28.895
"I'm sorry. Okay?"

36:28.978 --> 36:30.897
"I'm sorry. Here. Take your phone."

36:30.980 --> 36:34.317
"I'm sorry. Just go back to sleep.
I am sorry. I just…"

36:34.400 --> 36:36.027
"I guess I've just been insecure

36:36.110 --> 36:39.030
'cause of all this cheating
I've been doing. Good night."

36:43.409 --> 36:46.329
She didn't let me leave.
Said, "Since you wanna wake a bitch up…"

36:46.412 --> 36:48.748
Then she pulled my phone
from under her pillow.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.583
I said, "What the fuck?"

36:51.959 --> 36:54.212
She said,
"Who is this bitch in this picture?"

36:54.295 --> 36:56.047
I said, "How'd you open that phone?"

36:56.130 --> 36:58.299
She said, "Easy. All I had
to do was mash my nose

36:58.382 --> 37:01.802
and go like this, and it opened right up."
I said, "What the fuck?"

37:05.598 --> 37:08.935
She said, "Who is this bitch?"
I said, "Give me that."

37:10.937 --> 37:14.065
"Girl, relax. That ain't no bitch.
This is my friend."

37:14.148 --> 37:15.274
"Deborah."

37:20.821 --> 37:23.699
I'm gonna close the night
with a long story. Do you mind?

37:29.622 --> 37:32.500
All right. It's a long one.
So pretend that I've finished.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.877
'Cause I gotta go get
a cigarette. All right?

37:34.961 --> 37:37.588
I'm not done, but just act like it.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.674
I'd prefer standing ovations
since we're acting.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.384
Thank you very much. Good night.

38:11.038 --> 38:13.624
Thanks for not giving me
a standing O, motherfuckers.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.834
This is the worst.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.796
It's all right. I just wanted to smoke.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.258
You like that, don't you?

38:28.806 --> 38:30.266
Okay.

38:30.349 --> 38:34.103
Before I did Killin' Them Softly,
when I was 22,

38:35.271 --> 38:38.816
HBO gave me the biggest opportunity
of my life at that time.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.526
They gave me a half-hour special,

38:40.609 --> 38:43.237
but this shit was not like a special,
you know what I mean?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.655
It was like, generic.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.658
It didn't even have a title.
It just says "Dave Chappelle."

38:48.826 --> 38:54.540
And I shot it in San Francisco,
at a place called Broadway Studios,

38:54.623 --> 38:57.251
which is on the second floor
of a building.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.838
And beneath Broadway Studios
is a nightclub.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.842
And the special
was only supposed to be 30 minutes.

39:05.801 --> 39:09.263
And I got ready. I practiced.
I did all the shit I was supposed to do.

39:10.056 --> 39:13.934
And the night that I taped,
20 minutes into my 30-minute set,

39:15.478 --> 39:17.021
I'll never forget this music.

39:17.688 --> 39:21.275
Music started blasting
from the nightclub underneath.

39:21.359 --> 39:26.364
You could hear it real loud and it fucked
my whole show up, and I was devastated.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.574
I was a young man.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.119
I really believed in what I was doing.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.663
And I thought
that my dream had been killed.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.792
So when I got off stage,
I ran down the steps

39:37.875 --> 39:42.129
to the alley behind Broadway Studios,
where the control trucks are parked,

39:42.213 --> 39:45.007
and I kicked that motherfucking door open.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.510
And I started yelling
at all the producers.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.930
I was nobody in show business.
Just a guy that believed in myself.

39:51.013 --> 39:53.474
I said, "Man, you fucked everything up."

39:53.557 --> 39:56.185
"That fucking music.
What the fuck were you thinking?"

39:56.268 --> 39:58.479
And there was a guy
who was a big-time producer.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.814
I ain't saying no names.

39:59.897 --> 40:03.818
He stood up and he said,
"Hey, kid, sit the fuck down."

40:04.777 --> 40:06.946
He said, "We didn't ruin anything."

40:07.029 --> 40:09.198
He said, "We made
a deal with that nightclub

40:09.281 --> 40:12.118
to not play music,
and they didn't honor the deal."

40:12.201 --> 40:15.454
And I said, "Who didn't honor the deal?"

40:15.538 --> 40:17.164
And he pointed to a guy.

40:17.873 --> 40:20.376
I'll never forget it.
It was an old white man

40:20.459 --> 40:22.503
sitting in a Ford Taurus by himself.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.090
And he said, "That guy right there."

40:26.173 --> 40:28.300
I didn't waste no time
or ask no questions.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.011
I went to that Ford Taurus
and I beat on that window,

40:31.095 --> 40:33.889
I said, "Open the door, motherfucker.
I want to talk to you."

40:33.973 --> 40:38.269
That old man looked at me for one second
and wisely drove the fuck off.

40:40.771 --> 40:44.024
And left me in the alley
cussing at anybody who would listen.

40:45.568 --> 40:49.363
And two minutes later,
literally 120 seconds later,

40:49.447 --> 40:51.532
it couldn't have been any more than that,

40:51.615 --> 40:54.952
the doors of the kitchen
in the alley of that nightclub

40:55.035 --> 40:57.663
underneath Broadway Studios swung open.

40:57.746 --> 41:01.792
And that old man was standing there,
that same old man with reinforcements.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.753
He had two big goons with him,
and he looked at me…

41:04.837 --> 41:06.338
He was calm as a cucumber.

41:06.422 --> 41:08.132
He said, "You, come here."

41:09.091 --> 41:10.468
"I want to talk to you."

41:11.469 --> 41:13.888
I didn't know anything
about streets at this age.

41:14.555 --> 41:18.517
But I found out later in my life
that these men were Russian mobsters.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.896
I don't know what you guys know
about the Russian mob,

41:21.979 --> 41:25.065
but these are the niggas
that killed Denzel in Training Day.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.990
All the producers knew
what I was up against.

41:33.073 --> 41:35.826
They said, "Dave, do not go in there."

41:35.910 --> 41:37.161
And I said, "Fuck y'all."

41:37.244 --> 41:40.956
And I walked right into that kitchen
and they closed the doors behind me,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.751
and it got the dark
as fuck in there, and I knew.

41:43.834 --> 41:47.755
I'm not dumb.
I knew I was in a bad situation.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.215
But you have to understand,

41:49.298 --> 41:52.593
I believed in what I was doing,
and I didn't give a fuck.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.012
Just kept cussing at these motherfuckers.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.097
Tell them how they ruined my life.

41:57.181 --> 42:01.352
And that old man couldn't believe
that I was talking all of this shit.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.314
And as soon as I took a breath,
he stopped me gently.

42:05.397 --> 42:07.233
He said, "Hey, kid, listen."

42:08.442 --> 42:10.110
"Your friends lied to you."

42:11.278 --> 42:12.863
He said. "We made a deal."

42:13.572 --> 42:16.283
"But your friends never paid me."

42:17.368 --> 42:21.121
And when he said that,
I realized I was locked in a kitchen.

42:26.168 --> 42:29.964
I realized he was telling the truth,
which would make me wrong.

42:30.047 --> 42:34.260
And the moment, the very moment
that I realized I was wrong,

42:34.343 --> 42:37.096
for the first time, I was afraid.

42:38.055 --> 42:42.893
You see, it's a funny thing
if you believe you're absolutely right.

42:43.811 --> 42:47.481
You can get drunk off
the feeling of how right you are.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.316
That's why gay people are so mean.

43:02.621 --> 43:03.789
But I didn't buckle.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.083
You guys would've been very proud of me.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.960
I was scared, but I didn't buckle.

43:08.043 --> 43:11.130
I said, "Well, then, sir,
I owe you an apology."

43:11.880 --> 43:15.259
"But I believe that no matter what reason
that music was playing,

43:15.342 --> 43:16.719
it ruined my life."

43:17.761 --> 43:21.640
And that old man looked at me
with sympathy in his eyes.

43:22.433 --> 43:26.770
And he walked over to me
and he gently placed his hand on my cheek.

43:26.854 --> 43:31.191
Which I gotta tell you,
it is a very emasculating thing to do.

43:32.276 --> 43:35.738
I was standing there looking
at this nigga's hand on my cheek, like…

43:41.910 --> 43:46.123
And he said, "You are a real man."

43:46.915 --> 43:48.584
And he tapped me on my cheek.

43:49.627 --> 43:50.794
Real soft.

43:52.129 --> 43:55.049
And just like that,
the doors open back up.

43:55.758 --> 43:58.218
The light from the alley
flooded into the kitchen,

43:58.302 --> 44:00.304
and I just walked out alive.

44:00.387 --> 44:03.515
I lived to fight… another day.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.976
And in that moment,

44:06.060 --> 44:08.729
I learned one of the most
valuable lessons of my life,

44:08.812 --> 44:10.814
and I have to share it with you.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.232
And that lesson is this.

44:13.067 --> 44:17.529
In your life, at any given moment,

44:17.613 --> 44:22.076
the strongest dream
in that moment wins that moment.

44:22.159 --> 44:26.330
I am a very powerful dreamer.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.208
Yeah, I'm not lying.

44:33.837 --> 44:37.299
I dreamed tonight, this very night,

44:37.383 --> 44:39.510
as a 14-year-old boy,

44:39.593 --> 44:43.180
and I am living it as a 50-year-old man.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.558
My dreams are very strong.

44:48.727 --> 44:51.063
Today, I walked all around Washington.

44:51.146 --> 44:53.273
I used to be poor in this city,

44:53.357 --> 44:56.860
and all day, people just said,
"Hey, Dave. Hey, Dave."

44:56.944 --> 45:01.073
Like they knew me personally,
and I felt like I knew them.

45:01.156 --> 45:05.285
And I say to myself,
"My God, Dave, what a powerful dream."

45:06.120 --> 45:07.830
But then, sometimes…

45:10.666 --> 45:14.420
Sometimes… I feel regular.

45:15.879 --> 45:17.798
I just feel like myself.

45:17.881 --> 45:21.552
Maybe I'll smoke some weed
and be at some nightclub and feel shy.

45:22.886 --> 45:26.723
But I'll look across the nightclub,
see some guy that no one's ever heard of.

45:26.807 --> 45:29.726
But this nigga worked all week
and got bottle service,

45:29.810 --> 45:34.106
and this bitch is bringing
Moët and sparklers to 'em.

45:35.065 --> 45:36.942
I picture, in my mind, he's Persian.

45:37.025 --> 45:39.862
He's doing some kind
of weird Persian dance.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.656
He got six bitches at his table
because he got so much liquor.

45:42.739 --> 45:46.160
And they all just saying,
"Go Cena! Go Cena!"

45:46.243 --> 45:49.204
And I was looking across
the room like, "Oh, my God."

45:49.913 --> 45:51.748
"I'm in that guy's dream."

45:52.708 --> 45:56.211
I can hear him telling his friends.
"Hey, how was the club last night?"

45:56.295 --> 45:58.630
"That shit was fantastic.
I had bottle service."

45:58.714 --> 46:02.426
"I seen Dave Chappelle across the club,
looking at me like, 'Who is that?'"

46:05.429 --> 46:08.265
And that's the trick to life.

46:08.932 --> 46:14.271
You have to be wise enough to know
when you were living in your dream.

46:14.354 --> 46:19.067
And you have to be humble enough
to accept when you're in someone else's.

46:21.361 --> 46:22.446
That's why…

46:23.780 --> 46:28.327
That's why I don't judge
between Will Smith, and Chris Rock.

46:29.077 --> 46:31.371
Because you guys
look at them as big ideas,

46:31.455 --> 46:34.875
but I look at them as fellow dreamers.

46:35.626 --> 46:40.297
I can't judge between them
because I see myself in both of them.

46:40.797 --> 46:42.549
I am Will Smith.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.469
I am the man that cannot take it anymore

46:45.552 --> 46:48.055
and will slap the shit
out of the next person

46:48.138 --> 46:51.433
that says a cross word to me
or somebody that I love.

46:52.226 --> 46:53.519
And I am Chris Rock.

46:54.144 --> 46:57.940
I am the man that can get slapped
in front of the whole world

46:58.649 --> 47:02.569
and keep my composure
so I don't fuck anything up.

47:03.904 --> 47:09.201
That… is what… men do.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.579
Men make boundaries.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.665
Men enforce boundaries.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.292
And men tests boundaries.

47:17.376 --> 47:20.546
And no man test more boundaries

47:20.629 --> 47:21.755
than a trans man.

47:35.310 --> 47:39.106
When I see a fellow dreamer,
I give them my utmost respect,

47:39.189 --> 47:41.733
even if I don't understand
what their dream is.

47:41.817 --> 47:44.111
I know a dreamer when I see one.

47:44.194 --> 47:47.447
And I've met
many powerful dreamers in my life.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.949
None more powerful

47:50.742 --> 47:53.537
than a man who calls himself…

47:55.414 --> 47:56.707
Lil Nas X.

48:00.961 --> 48:04.631
I met this nigga at a party.
I had no idea who he was.

48:04.715 --> 48:08.302
But the minute he walked in that party,
I knew I was in his dream.

48:10.929 --> 48:13.098
Everybody in the party
was another dreamer.

48:13.181 --> 48:14.182
Everyone was famous.

48:14.266 --> 48:15.767
But when that nigga walked in,

48:15.851 --> 48:18.186
he was dressed like C-3PO.
He was shining.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.153
And everyone was like, "Oh, my God,
there he is. That's Lil Nas X!"

48:26.236 --> 48:28.113
I didn't know who he was.
For some reason,

48:28.196 --> 48:30.907
out of all of them dreamers,
he walked right up to me.

48:34.578 --> 48:37.456
And he said,
"I tried to get you in my video."

48:37.539 --> 48:40.751
I didn't know what the fuck
he was talking about. I said, "What?"

48:41.877 --> 48:43.253
"What video?"

48:43.337 --> 48:45.130
And he was just looking at me like…

48:46.423 --> 48:48.759
"You know what video," and walked away.

48:51.678 --> 48:54.890
And I watched him walk away.
I said, "Man." I said…

48:55.724 --> 48:58.226
"This nigga's having
a very powerful dream."

49:03.357 --> 49:04.941
You know what it reminded me of?

49:05.025 --> 49:07.027
It remind me
of when we was in grade school.

49:07.110 --> 49:10.155
Remember, the teacher would ask everybody
what they want to be.

49:10.238 --> 49:13.867
"Timmy. Timmy, what do you
want to be when you grow up?"

49:14.618 --> 49:16.036
Timmy acted like he had an idea.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.872
He'd stand up and he'd say,
"I want to be a fireman."

49:18.955 --> 49:22.918
And the teacher would say,
"Timmy, that is a beautiful dream."

49:23.001 --> 49:24.795
But Timmy didn't mean it.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.713
Timmy said he wanted to be a fireman

49:26.797 --> 49:29.341
because deep down,
Timmy is attracted to fire.

49:32.844 --> 49:36.640
And by the time he's 14 years old,
this nigga is a full-blown pyromaniac,

49:36.723 --> 49:39.643
playing with kerosene and matches
like a goddamn expert.

49:39.726 --> 49:43.397
Then one night he goes downtown
with his buddies fucking around with fire,

49:43.480 --> 49:44.898
burns a warehouse down.

49:44.981 --> 49:47.150
He doesn't know it,
but there's 13 migrant workers

49:47.234 --> 49:48.902
from El Salvador in that motherfucker.

49:48.985 --> 49:51.321
They get trapped
and then they die in the fire.

49:51.405 --> 49:52.489
Isn't that a tragedy?

49:53.907 --> 49:55.200
Well, it was an accident.

49:56.576 --> 49:59.788
He's only 14 years old. But he's Black.

49:59.871 --> 50:02.082
So they try him as an adult.

50:02.165 --> 50:04.793
Timmy ends up spending
the rest of his life in jail.

50:04.876 --> 50:06.920
Dream deferred.
[mimics buzzer sound]

50:14.678 --> 50:16.096
"What about you, Billy?"

50:16.179 --> 50:19.099
"Billy? Billy, What do you
want to be when you grow up?"

50:19.182 --> 50:20.934
Billy stands up and he says,

50:21.017 --> 50:25.105
"I want to be president
of the United States."

50:25.188 --> 50:27.524
And the teacher says, "Oh, my God, Billy."

50:27.607 --> 50:31.236
"Billy, that is a wonderful dream."

50:32.446 --> 50:33.989
And Billy means that shit.

50:34.614 --> 50:36.408
Billy does everything right.

50:36.491 --> 50:39.870
That motherfucker gets his grades up,
he joins student government.

50:39.953 --> 50:41.788
He even does extracurricular activities

50:41.872 --> 50:44.291
like show choir
just to make his resume look good.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.293
He's on track to be president.

50:46.376 --> 50:48.587
But junior year, he wipes.

50:48.670 --> 50:51.047
When he's 16,
he gets his girlfriend pregnant,

50:51.923 --> 50:54.551
and has to drop out of high school
to make ends meet.

50:55.594 --> 50:58.764
But lucky for him,
the local Walmart's hiring.

51:00.807 --> 51:02.350
By the time he's 20 years old,

51:02.434 --> 51:05.020
this motherfucker makes
assistant manager at Walmart.

51:05.103 --> 51:06.980
He's the youngest one in the district.

51:07.063 --> 51:10.192
He says, "Oh, my God,
if I can keep this up for four more years,

51:10.275 --> 51:11.985
I could be a manager."

51:12.068 --> 51:14.738
"If I can keep this up
for six more years after that,

51:14.821 --> 51:16.698
I could even be a regional manager

51:16.782 --> 51:20.076
and have as many
as three Walmarts under my control."

51:21.453 --> 51:24.790
And he's a big-picture guy.
He sees where this path is going.

51:25.499 --> 51:26.708
So he kills himself.

51:31.797 --> 51:33.298
[mimics buzzer sound]

51:40.889 --> 51:42.265
"What about you?"

51:42.849 --> 51:44.976
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

51:45.894 --> 51:47.437
"I don't wanna say."

51:48.271 --> 51:50.899
"Because I don't want
the other kids to laugh at me."

51:51.775 --> 51:53.610
"Who cares if they laugh?"

51:53.693 --> 51:55.320
"Your dream is yours."

51:56.530 --> 51:58.782
"Own your dreams so they can come true."

51:58.865 --> 52:01.034
"Say it loud and proud."

52:01.117 --> 52:03.537
"What do you want to be when you grow up,

52:03.620 --> 52:04.996
Lil Nas X?"

52:07.999 --> 52:10.460
That nigga stood up
in front of the whole class.

52:11.795 --> 52:14.297
"I want to be
the gayest nigga that ever lived."

52:15.882 --> 52:17.217
"I want to do a music video,

52:17.300 --> 52:20.387
slide down a stripper pole,
all the way to the depths of hell,

52:20.470 --> 52:23.640
and suck the devil's dick
at ten o'clock on BET

52:23.723 --> 52:26.017
while all the kids
are awake and can see me."

52:29.813 --> 52:32.482
Shockingly, that was
the only dream that worked out.

52:43.451 --> 52:45.203
That's why I'm here.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.163
Tonight.

52:47.247 --> 52:50.709
In the city
where I built the dreams that I live.

52:50.792 --> 52:54.254
'Cause I wanted
to tell you all that they came true.

52:54.337 --> 52:59.050
And I wanted to thank you all
for making the man that I am today.

53:04.139 --> 53:07.392
Yes, I am living a very powerful dream.

53:07.475 --> 53:11.730
Every time I come to this city
and I stand in front of you,

53:11.813 --> 53:16.151
I realize that, "My God, man,
this is not my dream at all."

53:16.234 --> 53:20.488
"It's yours,
and I am honored to be in it."

53:20.572 --> 53:23.366
Thank you very much, Washington D.C.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.285
