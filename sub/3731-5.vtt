[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

[man sings in Spanish]

02:14.669 --> 02:16.421
[sighs]

02:17.881 --> 02:19.299
I don't get it.

02:19.382 --> 02:22.343
Why do we have to shoot
the end of the film first?

02:22.427 --> 02:24.012
It's ridiculous.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.681
Some things never change.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.069
[song tempo increases]

02:44.741 --> 02:46.201
[sighs]

03:01.633 --> 03:03.468
I feel a little bit bloated today.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.470
You look fantastic, Lito. Come on.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.188
[sighs]

03:37.043 --> 03:39.712
I-- I feel like shit today. Please.

03:40.964 --> 03:43.842
- Can I get some Advil, please?
- Sure.

04:03.695 --> 04:04.946
[speaks Spanish]
Are you for real?

04:05.613 --> 04:06.865
[speaks Korean]
Are you for real?

04:12.787 --> 04:14.580
[song ends]

04:18.001 --> 04:20.212
- Here it is.
- Did you see?

04:20.295 --> 04:21.921
See what?

04:28.636 --> 04:31.431
- The fuck were you thinkin'?
- Sir?

04:31.556 --> 04:35.352
I just spent the last hour on the phone
getting my ass reamed by the Feds.

04:35.435 --> 04:38.688
- OK, sir, I can--
- You can shut the fuck up.

04:39.522 --> 04:42.650
You will know when I'm done speaking
because there will be a pause,

04:42.734 --> 04:47.613
followed by the words "I'm sorry, Captain,
this will never happen again."

04:47.697 --> 04:49.282
Pullin' in favors?

04:49.366 --> 04:53.828
Tryin' to use your old man's rep
to get around direct orders? For what?

04:57.374 --> 05:00.460
- Was that a pause?
- Jesus flying fuckballs.

05:00.543 --> 05:04.256
Sorry, listen, when I saw Jonas at that
store, I felt like there was a connection.

05:04.339 --> 05:06.507
I thought maybe I could use that
to get some intelligence.

05:06.591 --> 05:08.051
No luck there.

05:08.134 --> 05:11.012
Intelligence would have meant
doing what you were told.

05:11.721 --> 05:15.392
None of us have time
for any more of your fuckin' around.

05:18.644 --> 05:19.896
That was the pause.

05:19.979 --> 05:21.689
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

05:21.773 --> 05:23.024
Never happen again.

05:23.108 --> 05:24.692
Now get the fuck outta here.

05:35.328 --> 05:36.913
[Wolfgang sighs]

05:39.791 --> 05:40.833
Ah!

05:40.917 --> 05:44.629
- Wolfgang.
- Uncle.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.339
I have a problem.

05:47.757 --> 05:50.093
But the thing about my problems is...

05:50.927 --> 05:54.514
that they tend to become
other people's problems.

05:56.849 --> 05:58.101
Sit down, please.

06:11.656 --> 06:14.493
There was a robbery a few days ago.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.702
Black market diamonds from Mumbai.

06:16.786 --> 06:21.707
Stolen from a safe the day before
they were to be picked up by the buyer.

06:23.584 --> 06:29.007
I know this because my son
had been casing this place for months.

06:29.090 --> 06:32.969
Pickups, deliveries,
when the place was empty.

06:34.262 --> 06:38.599
Steiner is furious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:38.683 --> 06:41.478
And there are few things
as unpleasant for me

06:41.561 --> 06:44.063
as listening to my own son whine.

06:48.318 --> 06:53.614
The interesting part is...
the safe was not drilled.

06:53.698 --> 06:56.993
No one bored through
to look at the tumblers,

06:57.076 --> 06:59.787
poured liquid nitrogen
or acid inside.

06:59.871 --> 07:01.998
No, no, no, no. [gentle scoff]

07:02.748 --> 07:04.125
[laughs]

07:04.959 --> 07:06.711
The safe was cracked.

07:09.506 --> 07:10.882
Yeah.

07:10.965 --> 07:17.222
More interesting still is...
that the safe was an S&D.

07:18.764 --> 07:22.018
The same kind of safe
that fucked your father.

07:22.101 --> 07:24.020
Mm.

07:30.235 --> 07:33.446
It would be an irony
of Shakespearean proportions

07:33.530 --> 07:36.991
if his son fucked his own life

07:37.075 --> 07:41.496
cracking the safe his father
failed to crack, wouldn't it?

07:46.334 --> 07:49.295
I'm not as stupid as my father.

07:56.636 --> 07:59.889
Wolfgang? Your father made mistakes.

07:59.972 --> 08:01.682
Every man does.

08:03.726 --> 08:06.229
You should always remember who you are.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.948
I think about that every day.

08:48.187 --> 08:49.564
[speaks in Swahili]

08:51.899 --> 08:53.401
I don't understand.

08:55.403 --> 08:56.404
You speak English?

08:58.698 --> 09:02.494
- Uh... You speak English?
- Oh, yes.

09:02.577 --> 09:04.537
I speak very good English.

09:05.997 --> 09:07.748
Where am I?

09:09.125 --> 09:12.795
It's so warm, I can feel the heat.

09:12.878 --> 09:15.756
Kibera, Nairobi.

09:17.049 --> 09:18.259
In Africa?

09:18.343 --> 09:20.303
[chuckles]

09:20.386 --> 09:22.597
Africa... Kenya.

09:25.141 --> 09:27.519
Where is this? This is freezing.

09:27.602 --> 09:29.145
London.

09:29.228 --> 09:31.772
London. Ah...

09:31.856 --> 09:35.067

- Can I?
- [chuckles]

09:50.958 --> 09:52.126

09:54.462 --> 09:56.005
I like it.

10:16.150 --> 10:19.153
Hey, Van Damme,
give me the fucking bag.

10:19.945 --> 10:21.197
I can't do that.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.075
Give it to me
or we beat the fuck out of you.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.460
I don't want to hurt you.

10:42.677 --> 10:47.557
If your enemy will not be humbled,
destroy him.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.142
- Give the bag, bitch!
- [screams]

Spirit of Jean-Claude Korean lady,

11:43.154 --> 11:46.699
I know you have
more important things to do,

11:46.783 --> 11:49.410
but for me, nothing is more important.

12:06.678 --> 12:12.266
OK, Lito.
So, big scene: boy meets girl.

12:12.350 --> 12:15.936
You have started working for her father,
Don Carlos. Right?

12:16.020 --> 12:19.440
Am I beginning to suspect that
he is behind the death squads?

12:19.524 --> 12:23.402
No, definitely not.
You find him charming.

12:23.486 --> 12:26.113
- But I think I sense he is evil, right?
- No, not at all. No.

12:26.197 --> 12:28.908
- You are just hot for his daughter.
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.995
The script is full of so much pain.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.373
I think I should feel it.

12:36.165 --> 12:39.043
- No, not at all. Here.
- Hey--

12:39.126 --> 12:42.254
You need fire, you need heat, OK?

12:42.338 --> 12:43.923
- We're going to keep it sexy.
- OK, yeah.

12:44.006 --> 12:45.550
- Can you keep it sexy for me?
- Yeah.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.677
Yes? El CaÃ­do, remember.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.680
OK, can we shoot today? Yes?

12:50.763 --> 12:53.140
Are we ready? OK. Here we go.

12:53.224 --> 12:56.268
- Nachito! Come on!
- Take position, everyone!

Lito, what are you doing?

13:44.859 --> 13:46.945
Tears are not hot.

13:47.027 --> 13:51.365
- Tears are not sexy.
- Sorry. My fault.

13:52.241 --> 13:55.787
Um... I'm just feeling
a little emotional today.

13:57.079 --> 14:00.124
[whispers]
I was suddenly struck by her beauty

14:00.207 --> 14:05.671
and the knowledge that...
all beauty is temporary.

14:05.755 --> 14:08.591
Decay and death
haunt every breath we take.

14:08.674 --> 14:13.012
Lito, are you kidding me?
Lighten up.

14:13.095 --> 14:17.016
"Decay and death"?
This is a movie, for fuck's sake.

14:17.099 --> 14:19.351
OK, people. Come on. Nachito!

14:19.435 --> 14:21.437
We don't have all day! Come on!

14:21.520 --> 14:24.607
[man] Take your positions, everyone!
We're going again! Come on!

14:24.690 --> 14:27.234
[director] OK, Lito,
take a breathe or something.

14:27.318 --> 14:29.320
[sobs] Wait, wait, wait!

14:30.279 --> 14:33.574
- I need makeup, man. Bring me the makeup.
- [director] Makeup!

14:34.742 --> 14:39.538
[mother] Mehndi represents the outer
and the inner sun of your being.

14:39.622 --> 14:42.207
It is the awakening of your inner light.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.753
It strengthens and deepens the bond

14:45.837 --> 14:49.966
between you and the man
who's to be your husband.

14:52.468 --> 14:54.428
- Mom?
- Hm?

14:54.512 --> 14:57.807
How did you feel about Dad at this point?

14:57.890 --> 14:59.224
[chuckles]

14:59.308 --> 15:03.103
We had met only once
when we were very young...

15:04.229 --> 15:06.691
when his family came to Punjab.

15:07.525 --> 15:11.195
Were you nervous? Excited?

15:12.530 --> 15:14.740
Did you think Dad
was gonna make you happy?

15:14.824 --> 15:15.950
[laughs]

15:16.034 --> 15:19.286
Things were much different then.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.413
Love marriages were not very common.

15:21.497 --> 15:26.585
I think, uh, you are the first
in the family, in fact, to marry for love.

15:28.253 --> 15:30.255
But many things are the same.

15:31.674 --> 15:35.761
My family wished the same thing for me
as we wish for you.

15:35.845 --> 15:37.889
And he's a perfect match for you.

15:39.849 --> 15:42.018
You know, my astrologer saw many children.

15:42.101 --> 15:45.437
[laughing]

15:46.939 --> 15:49.901
Everything is going to be all right,
my dear.

15:49.984 --> 15:54.572
- Everything's going to be perfect.
- [mother] Yes.

15:54.655 --> 15:57.658
Aah! Don't move!

16:01.412 --> 16:03.288
[women whisper indistinctly]

16:06.667 --> 16:08.711
Don't move.

16:18.512 --> 16:20.932
What is wrong with you?

16:21.766 --> 16:25.227
Never have I seen you
this unfocused before.

16:25.310 --> 16:30.024
- You are of two minds.
- At least.

16:30.108 --> 16:31.734
[man] What?

16:31.817 --> 16:33.652
Nothing, teacher.

16:35.571 --> 16:38.490
There are better ways
that I could be spending my time.

16:41.035 --> 16:48.042
Whatever is distracting you,
whatever it is you must decide or do,

16:48.126 --> 16:54.423
decide it and do it,
and then come back to me.

16:59.845 --> 17:03.015
[horns honking]

17:06.560 --> 17:09.563
I'm a fucking mess.
I'm a fucking mess, Hernando.

17:09.647 --> 17:11.273
[Hernando]
The set doctor said you were fine.

17:11.356 --> 17:14.068
Fine? [scoffs] Fine?

17:14.152 --> 17:17.155
No, no, Hernando, I'm not fine.
I have a horrible pain in my stomach.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.199
It's-- I'm paralyzed. I'm...

17:21.867 --> 17:23.786
It feels like a tumor.

17:24.662 --> 17:29.500
[sobs] You know cancer runs in my family,
Hernando. What if it's cancer?

17:29.583 --> 17:32.461
- [horns honking]
- What is it? What is--

17:32.544 --> 17:34.088
What is the point? What is the point?

17:34.172 --> 17:37.508
My lane isn't going any faster,
you... fuck!

17:37.591 --> 17:39.510
[honking]

17:39.593 --> 17:41.261
I see you, villain!

17:41.345 --> 17:44.640
I see you with your
fucking villain mustache!

17:46.475 --> 17:48.853
- Fuck! [sobs]
- [Hernando] Calm down, Lito.

17:48.936 --> 17:52.481
- I'm under attack, Hernando!
- OK, take a deep breath, please.

17:52.564 --> 17:54.608
[sobbing] I can't.

17:54.692 --> 17:57.736
I can't breathe! I can't think!

17:57.820 --> 18:00.990
I-- I can't remember anything!

18:01.073 --> 18:04.869
- Hernando-- Hernando? Are you there?
- Yes, yes, yes, I am here.

18:04.952 --> 18:09.081
You know, before, I went to order elotes.
You know I love elotes.

18:09.165 --> 18:10.582
Yes, you love elotes, yes.

18:10.666 --> 18:14.503
But when I tried to order them, I couldn't
remember that elotes are called elotes.

18:14.586 --> 18:16.338
Lito, you're going to have an accident.

18:16.421 --> 18:20.843
Oh, you did not! Excuse me! I-- You--

18:20.926 --> 18:24.222
You tacky, cheap weave,
plastic-titted whore!

18:24.304 --> 18:27.349
I see you! I see you!

18:27.432 --> 18:29.060
[speaks Korean]
Please stop screaming.

18:29.143 --> 18:30.686
I'm not screaming!

18:36.734 --> 18:39.611
[speaks Spanish]
Where am I?

18:40.612 --> 18:42.781
[Hernando] Lito, please, listen to me.

18:42.865 --> 18:45.701
I don't know where I am, Hernando.
Hernando?

18:45.784 --> 18:47.619
Are you hearing voices?

18:47.703 --> 18:51.040
No, I'm-- I'm seeing things.

18:51.123 --> 18:52.875
Seeing things?

18:52.958 --> 18:55.794
There's-- There's a crying Korean woman.

18:55.878 --> 18:59.965
I'm not... crying. [soft sob]

19:00.049 --> 19:02.927
There's a Korean woman
standing next to me,

19:03.010 --> 19:06.597
and she's not crying the same way
that I'm not screaming!

19:09.433 --> 19:11.685
[tires screech, crashing]

19:11.769 --> 19:13.187
[Hernando] Lito, what happened?

19:13.271 --> 19:15.814
- [horns honking]
- What the fuck?!

19:15.898 --> 19:19.068
- Hernando, please save me.
- [man] Where you get your license, man?

19:51.142 --> 19:53.518
Fuck! Hey! Fuck!

20:05.030 --> 20:06.657
[phone ringing]

20:08.159 --> 20:10.995
- [woman] Hello?
- Janet Marks?

20:11.078 --> 20:14.165
- Yes?
- Hi. This is Officer Will Gorski.

20:14.248 --> 20:17.542
- I'm calling about your daughter Nomi.
- Have you found him?

20:17.626 --> 20:20.671
Not yet. The hospital she was admitted to
reported her missing.

20:20.754 --> 20:22.923
I was hoping you might
have some more information.

20:23.007 --> 20:24.716
I knew this would happen.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.761
This isn't the first time
Michael's had problems with the police.

20:27.845 --> 20:30.889
Yeah, I'm seeing
some arrests here for hacking,

20:30.973 --> 20:32.850
misdemeanor electronic intrusion--

20:32.933 --> 20:35.769
Police showing up at our door
at all hours.

20:36.561 --> 20:42.193
Michael fell in with bad company,
got infected with all these crazy ideas.

20:42.276 --> 20:45.737
I think all this business
with his brain began

20:45.821 --> 20:47.823
with those hormones he started taking.

20:48.824 --> 20:50.492
Most of it is illegal.

20:50.575 --> 20:54.163
God only knows
what's really inside that stuff.

20:54.246 --> 20:57.416
But, Michael's never been sensible.

20:57.499 --> 20:59.043
- Nomi.
- What?

20:59.126 --> 21:01.253
Not Michael. Her name is Nomi.

21:04.923 --> 21:08.844
Hey, hon. Just got a text from Disney.
They're on their way.

21:10.804 --> 21:12.472
You OK?

21:14.392 --> 21:17.686
Something happened
when I walked over here, didn't it?

21:17.769 --> 21:19.104
What?

21:22.274 --> 21:24.609
I was looking at the people
and I had this feeling.

21:24.693 --> 21:28.280
It was so familiar,
something I've known my entire life.

21:28.947 --> 21:32.368
The feeling of being seen and not seen,

21:32.451 --> 21:37.415
of being a part of them
and being apart from them.

21:37.497 --> 21:44.088
And then I saw you... the first person
that made all of that go away,

21:44.171 --> 21:47.632
that made me feel I did fit in,
that I belonged.

21:49.801 --> 21:52.721
I saw you and for a moment...

21:55.057 --> 21:56.892
I didn't know who you were.

22:00.438 --> 22:03.899
It feels impossible. What's happening
to me, it feels impossible.

22:03.982 --> 22:07.903
Honey, not so long ago,
the idea of someone like me,

22:07.986 --> 22:12.366
someone with my crazy thoughts,
my... desires,

22:12.450 --> 22:14.826
someone with this kind of hair...
[dry chuckle]

22:14.910 --> 22:17.829
would've been completely impossible
in this world.

22:18.789 --> 22:20.374
Just as there was a time in my life

22:20.458 --> 22:24.044
when the idea of me falling in love
with someone like you...

22:25.170 --> 22:26.838
Honestly?

22:28.340 --> 22:30.801
Even I would have said
it was impossible.

22:32.886 --> 22:39.310
And yet, there we are,
in that tiny bathroom at the Lexington,

22:39.393 --> 22:42.729
and from the instant my lips
touched these two lips...

22:44.773 --> 22:48.610
I realized one of the most important
lessons of my life:

22:50.070 --> 22:54.116
impossibility is a kiss away from reality.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.838
- He kissed me.
- [laughter]

23:09.298 --> 23:13.218
The first time I kissed your father,
oh, dear! [giggles]

23:13.302 --> 23:16.138
Don't know whether he would
want me to tell you all this.

23:16.221 --> 23:18.349
[father] Of course,
because I'm back here cooking,

23:18.432 --> 23:21.352
I cannot hear a word you are saying,
my dearest one.

23:23.562 --> 23:25.730
[softly] The truth is,
for the longest time,

23:25.814 --> 23:30.194
I thought kissing is as eating a kebab,
because whenever I would kiss,

23:30.277 --> 23:33.738
all I would taste
was spices and garlic on his lips.

23:33.822 --> 23:36.367
[father] I'm sure that
whatever you are laughing at

23:36.450 --> 23:38.410
would not be at the expense of a man

23:38.494 --> 23:41.746
who would slave for hours making...
shahi tukda.

23:41.830 --> 23:44.708
- [all gasping]
- Ooh!

23:44.791 --> 23:46.418
[father] Oh, my God.

23:47.211 --> 23:49.087
Kala, you are beautiful.

23:50.548 --> 23:52.466
Thanks, Dad.

23:53.425 --> 23:54.676
May I?

23:55.594 --> 23:57.095
It's for you.

24:04.019 --> 24:06.980
- Mm...
- [mother chuckling]

24:08.899 --> 24:11.443
Dad, could you teach Rajan how to make it?

24:11.527 --> 24:13.737
- [laughter]
- No.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.198
[laughter]

24:16.281 --> 24:19.034
[Nomi] A minute ago,
this tasted like a normal coffee.

24:19.117 --> 24:21.870
Now it tastes like a sugary dessert.

24:21.953 --> 24:24.122
That doesn't sound like a bad thing.

24:26.375 --> 24:30.795
What if Dr. Metzger's right and there is
something wrong with my brain?

24:30.921 --> 24:34.174
Well, there are two possibilities.

24:35.259 --> 24:39.054
Possibility one: He's telling the truth.

24:40.305 --> 24:42.558
There is something wrong with your brain.

24:42.641 --> 24:47.187
And it's causing hallucinations
and you're gonna die.

24:47.271 --> 24:50.190
I'm not digging that one.
What's possibility two?

24:50.274 --> 24:52.610
That he's lying.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.820
That what he says is happening to you
isn't what's happening.

24:55.904 --> 24:58.657
And if that's the case,
there has to be a reason why he's lying,

24:58.740 --> 25:01.368
and we need to find out
what that reason is.

25:01.452 --> 25:05.038
Don't worry, hon,
we are going to figure this out.

25:07.416 --> 25:08.500
[door creaks]

25:08.584 --> 25:10.961
[men chattering in Swahili]

25:29.771 --> 25:31.315
[Silas] Well done, Van Damme.

25:37.446 --> 25:38.738
Come.

25:42.117 --> 25:43.785
What is going on here?

25:44.911 --> 25:46.955
You passed my test.

25:47.038 --> 25:49.207
Why?

25:49.291 --> 25:51.502
I had to know how far you would go.

25:56.214 --> 25:58.550
If you're willing to risk your life for...

26:01.011 --> 26:05.015
a pair of coconuts,
then you're the man I need.

26:27.538 --> 26:29.414
I'll be in touch, Van Damme.

26:45.514 --> 26:48.726
[giggles] "Steiner's furious!"

26:48.808 --> 26:52.896
[mocking] "Steiner is furious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

26:53.522 --> 26:58.736
"There are few things as unpleasant for me
as listening to my own son whine."

26:58.818 --> 27:00.195
[laughs]

27:00.278 --> 27:02.822
[mock sobbing] "Oh, Daddy!

27:02.906 --> 27:08.662
Daddy, somebody stole my diamonds.
I want my--"

27:08.746 --> 27:11.623
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, hey. New shirt.

27:11.707 --> 27:13.792
[softly]
Don't ever use that word, understand?

27:14.543 --> 27:17.254
Sergei's not stupid. He's watching us.

27:18.505 --> 27:20.758
- Sergei doesn't know shit.
- [sighs] Yeah.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.966
If he did, we'd be dead.

27:23.093 --> 27:27.431
He was just fucking with you,
trying to see if you knew anything.

27:27.514 --> 27:31.351
Probably had box men coming in all day,
giving them the same routine.

27:32.310 --> 27:36.106
He's just shaking the trees.

27:37.065 --> 27:39.818
Keep quiet. Stick to the plan.

27:41.486 --> 27:42.487
Got it.

27:45.073 --> 27:47.367
"Steiner's furious."

27:47.451 --> 27:48.910
[laughing]

27:50.245 --> 27:51.705
Gotta piss.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.721
[unzips pants]

28:07.805 --> 28:10.014
- [urinating]
- [belches]

28:10.098 --> 28:11.433
[speaks Hindi]
Who's there?

28:13.644 --> 28:15.771
[speaks German]
Is there a woman in here?

28:16.772 --> 28:19.899
[speaks Hindi] What do you mean is there
a woman in here. This is my bathroom.

28:22.611 --> 28:25.947
[speaks German] Your bathroom? Lady,
I think you may be even drunker than I am.

28:27.157 --> 28:29.827
[speaks Hindi] I'm not drunk,
though obviously you are!

28:38.293 --> 28:40.044
[speaks German]
What are you talking about?

28:42.255 --> 28:43.965
[speaks Hindi] I know that voice--

28:48.887 --> 28:50.138
[speaks German] Where are you?

28:50.889 --> 28:54.017
[speaks Hindi]
You are the singing man in my dream.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.769
[speaks Hindi] I can't see you.

28:58.146 --> 28:59.314
[Felix] Wolfgang?

29:01.274 --> 29:02.984
What the hell language is that?

29:06.321 --> 29:08.198
[knocking at door]

29:08.281 --> 29:13.036
[woman] Kala? Are you all right?
I heard you talking to someone.

29:14.162 --> 29:18.750
Oh, just... to myself.

29:19.417 --> 29:20.544
Oh.

29:20.627 --> 29:24.464
Well, if you ever need someone
to talk to about things...

29:24.548 --> 29:25.965
Things?

29:26.049 --> 29:29.887
Things that happen
on a girl's wedding night.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.971
Auntie, it's OK.

29:33.807 --> 29:35.767
We have the Internet.

29:35.851 --> 29:37.268
Oh!

29:37.352 --> 29:39.270
I knew that thing
was good for something.

29:39.354 --> 29:40.898
Mm.

29:45.736 --> 29:48.112
[Lito]
Am I making my mind up as it happens?

29:48.947 --> 29:51.909
- Or do I already know?
- You tell me, baby. You're the guy.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.870
Just make it real.
I want your guts on this one, yes?

29:54.953 --> 29:57.080
I think I should have a line
before I reach Don Carlos.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.624
- Sure. Whatever. Put it in. Yes.
- OK.

29:59.708 --> 30:01.668
So we're gonna rehearse
with the squibs, right?

30:01.752 --> 30:04.713
Fuck, no! I want chaos, confusion.

30:04.796 --> 30:07.465
I want blanks firing, squibs exploding.

30:07.549 --> 30:11.428
Total mayhem surrounding the meaningless
destruction of precious art.

30:11.511 --> 30:14.347
That's-- That's the message of this film.

30:14.431 --> 30:17.935
And without the grit of reality,
nobody's going to believe it.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.853
- OK? Your guts?
- OK.

30:19.937 --> 30:22.689
Yes! OK, are we ready for this? Nachito!

30:22.773 --> 30:25.191
- Bring it on, please. Come on, everybody.
- Bah! Bah!

30:26.109 --> 30:29.780
You won't believe it till you see it
with your own eyes. She's double-jointed.

30:29.863 --> 30:33.408
Blows the candles out on a cupcake
stuck in her own ass.

30:33.491 --> 30:35.744
Yeah, she's a real artist.

30:35.827 --> 30:36.995
Uh... [sighs]

30:37.078 --> 30:39.456
I can't. I got paperwork.

30:39.539 --> 30:42.542
Oh, you're goin'. It's Miller's 40th.

30:42.626 --> 30:44.002
You have to pay your respects.

30:44.085 --> 30:47.672
So, sign the fucking card, pendejo.

30:48.882 --> 30:50.717
Go on and put a twenty in there.

30:53.762 --> 30:56.264
- Holy shit.
- What?

30:57.098 --> 30:59.726
I requested an up-rez
of your photo from last night.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.146
- The kid?
- Yeah, check it out.

31:04.731 --> 31:06.608
Hey, check existing contacts.

31:07.692 --> 31:09.653
Checking.

31:09.736 --> 31:11.529
Boom. Name and last known.

31:11.613 --> 31:13.156
Let's go.

31:14.491 --> 31:16.660
Oh, I thought you had paperwork to do.

31:16.743 --> 31:18.662
No? No? All right.

31:20.622 --> 31:23.333
- Here they are.
- [Nomi] Oh.

31:24.709 --> 31:26.252
- Mm...
- Hey.

31:27.879 --> 31:30.048
Sorry it took so long.
I just wanted to be sure.

31:30.131 --> 31:31.132
There were cops?

31:31.215 --> 31:33.051
There's one staked out front
of your place.

31:33.134 --> 31:35.720
Every couple of hours, an unmarked car
rolls through the alley.

31:36.304 --> 31:37.889
Shit.

31:38.765 --> 31:40.558
Were you able to get hold of Isabella?

31:41.852 --> 31:44.354
She said no problem
using her back entrance.

31:45.522 --> 31:48.232
Thank you guys so much.
I know how much trouble this is.

31:48.316 --> 31:49.985
It's not a problem, Nomi.

31:50.068 --> 31:53.404
After what you did for Lola and me?
You're family.

31:54.238 --> 31:57.534
Clete Tamark. Couple convictions.

31:57.617 --> 31:59.995
Vandalism, disorderly conduct, MIP.

32:00.078 --> 32:03.040
He's running with
the New Maniac Mafia up in Englewood.

32:03.122 --> 32:07.085
What happened to the Old Maniac Mafia?
I miss them.

32:07.878 --> 32:10.171
He's just a kid, too.

32:10.254 --> 32:13.550
They're all kids, Will. They're all kids.

32:24.519 --> 32:26.312
Art is like religion.

32:27.605 --> 32:29.399
For the believers, it's everything.

32:29.482 --> 32:31.026
For anyone else...

32:32.276 --> 32:35.697
it's just a pile of stinking bullshit.

32:50.503 --> 32:51.504
I know you.

33:03.767 --> 33:05.102
Do I know you?

33:06.269 --> 33:08.772
This is not who you are.

33:16.404 --> 33:17.864
Clete! Cops!

33:17.948 --> 33:19.032
Kill him!

33:21.659 --> 33:23.202
[Diego] Oh, shit!

33:25.246 --> 33:27.290
Shit! Fuck!

33:27.373 --> 33:29.459
Hey! Stop!

33:30.376 --> 33:32.336
Boy, you better stop!

33:45.976 --> 33:47.477
I fuckin' hate this shit!

34:10.750 --> 34:11.918
Ah!

34:14.796 --> 34:15.630
[grunts]

34:15.713 --> 34:18.133
- Fuck!
- Get up, get up! Go, go, go!

34:22.137 --> 34:25.223
- [whispers] Kick me. Kick me.
- What?

34:25.306 --> 34:26.683
[whispers] Kick me.

34:50.498 --> 34:52.667
[man] Y'all smell pork?

35:16.024 --> 35:18.401
You in the wrong 'hood, po-po.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.571
- Get yo' bacon-smellin' ass on.
- You motherfuckers on a coffee break?

35:21.654 --> 35:23.240
Yeah, with yo' mama.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.741
[laughter]

35:24.824 --> 35:26.076
[Will] All right.

35:26.743 --> 35:30.080
What's wrong with this nig--?
[laughs] Bye-bye!

35:31.539 --> 35:33.291
OK, we're gonna have some fun.

35:35.459 --> 35:38.379
- [voice echoes] Fucking cut!
- How was it?

35:38.462 --> 35:41.758
I've got a hard-on
that's gonna last all week!

35:41.841 --> 35:45.929
Oh, so natural, so real!

35:46.012 --> 35:48.723
- Bra-vo! Bravo!
- Yes, yes, yes!

35:48.806 --> 35:50.267
- Yes!
- [gun fires]

35:50.349 --> 35:51.350
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

35:51.434 --> 35:53.519
I apologize. I'm sorry, man.

35:53.603 --> 35:55.813
- That's in the movie.
- Yeah?

35:55.897 --> 35:57.899
- That's in the movie, Lito!
- It's in the movie?

35:57.982 --> 35:59.358
- Yes! Come on!
- Thank you.

37:22.066 --> 37:24.777
[speaks Korean] Where am I? Where is this?

37:24.861 --> 37:26.237
Nairobi.

37:26.321 --> 37:27.905
[speaks Swahili] Where are you?

37:29.573 --> 37:32.118
- Seoul.
- [chuckles]

37:32.202 --> 37:33.744
[speaks Korean]

37:35.205 --> 37:39.125
- You speak Korean?
- Do you speak Swahili?

37:41.002 --> 37:43.338
Then how are we understanding each other?

37:43.421 --> 37:44.839
I don't know.

37:47.925 --> 37:50.887
You are the spirit of Jean-Claude.

37:50.970 --> 37:54.265
[laughs] I felt your spirit in me.

37:54.349 --> 37:55.892
You are a very good fighter.

37:55.975 --> 37:58.311
You don't know anything about me.

37:58.395 --> 38:02.857
I don't know how,
but I know your name is Sun.

38:04.275 --> 38:08.029
- You have a difficult decision to make.
- Stop. This cannot be real.

38:08.112 --> 38:10.198
What is real is I might have died
if it wasn't for you.

38:10.281 --> 38:11.782
I don't understand this.

38:11.866 --> 38:16.662
So if you do not mind,
I prefer to assume you're a hallucination.

38:17.997 --> 38:19.165
I take no offense.

38:19.249 --> 38:22.960
Since that is resolved,
I would like to continue my walk.

38:23.044 --> 38:24.795
Please.

38:24.879 --> 38:26.923
- Alone.
- Of course.

38:42.397 --> 38:44.107
- You're still here.
- I'm sorry.

38:44.190 --> 38:46.609
I don't know how I came here
or how I go back.

38:46.692 --> 38:50.113
Perhaps there is something in me
that calls or something in you that calls.

38:50.196 --> 38:52.323
I'm not calling you or anyone else.

38:53.116 --> 38:55.034
Perhaps that is the problem.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.788
Are you in trouble?

38:59.872 --> 39:04.210
No. But tomorrow I might be.

39:21.394 --> 39:23.229
I know this choice.

39:24.647 --> 39:27.191
It's like having two different lives.

39:28.526 --> 39:30.361
One will be very dangerous for me.

39:32.155 --> 39:34.407
The other, very bad for my mother.

39:36.575 --> 39:43.166
My question is, am I the person
who wants to see my brother punished,

39:43.249 --> 39:47.837
who wants to watch the business
my father built be destroyed?

39:48.712 --> 39:52.509
Or am I the person
who wants to save them,

39:52.591 --> 39:54.635
who will go to prison for them,

39:54.718 --> 39:59.098
even though they have been cruel to me
for my entire life?

40:00.266 --> 40:02.435
You are afraid.

40:04.895 --> 40:07.565
I feel it for my mother every day.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.153
I promised I would take care of her.

40:13.196 --> 40:15.739
Everything will be all right...

40:16.991 --> 40:18.826
I must keep that promise.

40:20.453 --> 40:22.788
I must keep it, no matter what.

40:24.582 --> 40:28.961
I promised my mother
I would protect my family.

40:29.045 --> 40:33.216
It was the last thing I said to her
before she died.

40:33.299 --> 40:37.011
- If I break it--
- Then your last words become a lie.

40:41.807 --> 40:45.853
Once, when I was eight...

40:47.980 --> 40:50.608
my father's enemies came to our house.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.904
They had big machetes, like this.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.823
My mother had a knife, like this.

40:57.907 --> 41:00.951
They wanted revenge
for what my father's tribe had done.

41:01.035 --> 41:03.246
They wanted me.

41:03.329 --> 41:06.624
My father was gone. She was alone.

41:07.708 --> 41:13.464
But... she put me behind her,
and she faced these men.

41:14.257 --> 41:15.966
They knew they could kill her.

41:16.050 --> 41:19.929
But they also looked her
in the eyes and knew

41:20.012 --> 41:23.474
she would take
at least one of them with her.

41:23.558 --> 41:25.393
And they left.

41:26.603 --> 41:29.188
Because none of them
wanted to be that one.

41:32.858 --> 41:37.863
Who can say if it is
we who make the choice,

41:37.947 --> 41:40.074
or the choice that makes us?

41:45.580 --> 41:47.457
[phone chimes]

42:01.345 --> 42:03.347
[woman 1] ...the ceremony.
The last thing we would...

42:03.431 --> 42:06.183
[woman 2] The color's
really looking nice on her.

42:06.267 --> 42:09.145
- [woman 3] Think it shows the right...
- [woman 2] Where did you have it made?

42:09.228 --> 42:12.565
- The same tailor we normally use?
- I had no idea how heavy it all would be.

42:12.649 --> 42:15.025
[women laughing, chattering]

42:15.776 --> 42:18.279
I hope I don't collapse
in the middle of the circle.

42:18.362 --> 42:20.072
[women chuckling]

42:23.451 --> 42:24.868
Priya!

42:31.041 --> 42:33.794
Priya, I don't want to
pressure anyone, but--

42:33.877 --> 42:36.673
- Sanyam, please!
- All right, all right. Take your time.

42:40.301 --> 42:43.596
[band plays up-tempo music]

43:12.625 --> 43:15.252
[no audible sounds]

44:00.172 --> 44:03.384
[band continues, muted]

45:37.311 --> 45:41.357
I take the first of seven steps with you,
my husband-to-be...

45:43.108 --> 45:48.906
that we may cherish each other
and promise that we will grow together...

45:48.989 --> 45:52.827
in mental and spiritual strength.

45:55.078 --> 45:58.332
[Rajan] I take the fourth
of the seven steps with you...

46:00.167 --> 46:04.797
I take the fifth of seven steps with you,
my husband-to-be,

46:04.881 --> 46:08.300
and promise love and obedience
in all things.

46:19.102 --> 46:22.815
I take the sixth of the seven steps
with you, my wife-to-be...

46:24.066 --> 46:27.027
with the promise of
everlasting companionship.

46:27.110 --> 46:29.906
[no audible dialogue]

46:36.412 --> 46:37.955
We shall share love.

46:38.038 --> 46:40.666
Share the same tastes.

46:53.554 --> 46:55.973
Share the same food.

47:03.272 --> 47:07.735
The final vow, the final step,
is yours, my love.

47:33.761 --> 47:38.307
Let us make a vow together
to share our strengths.

47:41.018 --> 47:42.352
[gasps softly]

47:54.406 --> 47:56.366
We shall be of one mind.

48:07.044 --> 48:09.922
We shall observe these vows together.

48:15.427 --> 48:20.016
Come thou, as I take the last
of seven steps with you and--

48:28.398 --> 48:29.984
What the fuck are you doing?

48:31.610 --> 48:33.403
You're not in love with him.

48:35.572 --> 48:38.701
- Kala? Kala?
- [woman screams]

48:38.784 --> 48:40.410
[audience gasps]
