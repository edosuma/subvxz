00:02.695 --> 00:04.703
- What's your name?
- I don't remember.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.629
ALEX: Hey, Uncle Mike.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.032
I don't think my brother
knows what a man is.

00:09.034 --> 00:10.667
What's the faggot doing here?

00:10.669 --> 00:13.137
I'm here to hook up
with hot football jocks.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.404
- You thought?
- Let him go!

00:14.406 --> 00:16.874
What do you say you and I,

00:16.876 --> 00:18.342
we choose to trust each other?

00:18.344 --> 00:20.277
I could really use someone to trust.

00:20.279 --> 00:21.245
Okay.

00:21.247 --> 00:23.447
We need to find a working car.

00:23.449 --> 00:24.889
Maybe this guy will give us a ride.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.686
You have the only working
car. You're my only chance.

00:29.688 --> 00:32.022
I will kill you all if I have to!

00:32.024 --> 00:34.391
- I can't give you...
- Shoot him!

00:38.063 --> 00:40.053
If we don't get him to a hospital,

00:40.056 --> 00:41.288
he's gonna die!

[Groaning]

01:06.959 --> 01:09.054
- Faster!
- I can't go any faster!

01:09.057 --> 01:10.490
I'm gonna hit something.

01:12.167 --> 01:13.527
What if nobody's at the hospital?

[Tires Squealing]

01:27.371 --> 01:28.545
Holy shit.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.038
- Take him in the side.
- They have power.

Nurse! What is going on out there?

01:51.519 --> 01:53.864
Is anybody coming? The military? Police?

01:53.867 --> 01:55.100
We hoped you knew.

01:55.103 --> 01:57.570
What happened? Get me a gurney!

02:00.613 --> 02:02.412
Dr. Bailey, GSW to the upper left thigh,

02:02.414 --> 02:03.981
actively bleeding.

02:03.983 --> 02:06.026
Start a large-bore I.V.,
and run L.R. wide open.

02:06.029 --> 02:07.186
Is he gonna be okay?

02:07.189 --> 02:08.285
I'm gonna work on him right now.

02:08.287 --> 02:09.318
Yeah, but that's not what I asked.

02:09.321 --> 02:10.561
I'll be back as soon as I can.

02:11.624 --> 02:13.257
He's gonna be fine.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.791
He'll be fine.

02:14.793 --> 02:16.526
You don't know that.

02:18.311 --> 02:19.443
But here's what I know.

02:19.446 --> 02:22.099
If he dies, it's because of you.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.467
What are you talking about?

02:25.635 --> 02:27.268
I'm not the one who shot him.

02:27.270 --> 02:28.936
Yeah, but you're the
one that didn't shoot.

02:28.938 --> 02:30.437
You can't blame me for
not just killing people.

02:30.439 --> 02:31.839
Yeah, but you are killing people,

02:31.841 --> 02:33.674
and Bryan could die because of you.

02:33.676 --> 02:35.276
I didn't shoot him!
There's a difference!

02:35.278 --> 02:36.744
Not anymore.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.733
[Dr. Bailey Sighs]

02:59.735 --> 03:02.733
So, um, we're cut off
from the operating rooms,

03:02.736 --> 03:05.639
and there's only so much
we can do in the E.R.,

03:05.641 --> 03:08.075
but we controlled the bleeding,
and there's no evidence

03:08.077 --> 03:11.056
that your friend injured
any major vessels or nerves.

03:11.059 --> 03:12.913
He lost a lot of blood,

03:12.915 --> 03:15.082
so expect him to be weak for a while.

03:15.084 --> 03:16.684
Can we see him?

03:16.686 --> 03:18.330
Uh, yeah, for a few minutes.

03:22.524 --> 03:24.221
[Electricity Crackles]

03:24.224 --> 03:25.690
Emergency generator?

03:25.693 --> 03:28.262
We should be okay for
another day or two.

03:28.264 --> 03:30.931
Electricity and old
battery-driven equipment,

03:30.933 --> 03:32.132
that's what we can use.

03:32.134 --> 03:35.236
How are things out there?

03:35.238 --> 03:37.338
Not good.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.772
And here?

03:38.774 --> 03:40.608
We're running out of food.

03:40.610 --> 03:42.610
We're running out of medicine.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.314
The mist is in the entire east wing.

03:50.886 --> 03:52.886
If I wanted to make sure

03:52.888 --> 03:54.855
my wife and daughter aren't here,

03:54.857 --> 03:56.790
where would I go?

03:56.792 --> 04:00.261
I'm home! Already done?

04:00.263 --> 04:01.595
We have moved in.

04:01.597 --> 04:02.730
Yeah!

04:02.732 --> 04:03.897
Wait!

First kiss inside our front door.

04:14.777 --> 04:16.410
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

04:18.314 --> 04:21.214
This is the living room. It's not done.

04:21.216 --> 04:23.050
This is where you'll work your magic.

04:23.052 --> 04:24.785
Yes, because I am the woman.

04:24.787 --> 04:26.631
Exactly. And in here...

04:34.497 --> 04:35.829
Think she'll like it?

04:35.831 --> 04:39.700
[Gasps] When did you do this?

04:39.702 --> 04:42.503
Yesterday. I said I was going to Mike's.

04:53.282 --> 04:54.715
Thank you.

04:55.918 --> 04:57.551
Not just for this.

04:58.788 --> 05:00.554
I'd do anything for you.

05:07.763 --> 05:09.897
It's strange.

05:09.899 --> 05:12.066
I've never been happier.

05:14.937 --> 05:17.371
But I've also never been...

05:19.642 --> 05:21.475
less myself.

05:21.477 --> 05:23.210
It's the weirdest feeling.

05:26.949 --> 05:29.650
We should unpack before she gets home.

05:34.357 --> 05:36.223
- Sorry, man.
- Thanks.

05:40.162 --> 05:42.029
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:42.031 --> 05:44.531
Uh, have you seen either
of these two people?

05:44.533 --> 05:46.367
No, I haven't.

05:46.369 --> 05:47.835
Thanks.

05:53.209 --> 05:55.876
Hi. I'm looking for
my wife and daughter.

05:55.878 --> 05:58.045
Have you... Have you seen them?

05:58.047 --> 05:59.580
No. I'm sorry.

Have you seen either

crying, and you never stopped.

Mike?

07:11.954 --> 07:13.253
What happened?

07:19.094 --> 07:20.527
Oh, Jesus, Mike.

07:28.971 --> 07:31.004
I was outside when the mist came...

07:32.441 --> 07:35.209
fixing another goddamn
hole in Main Street.

07:36.579 --> 07:39.112
These three kids came towards me,

07:39.114 --> 07:41.615
just normal-looking teenagers,

07:41.617 --> 07:43.884
but there was nothing normal about them.

07:46.922 --> 07:49.525
They beat the... out of me,

07:49.528 --> 07:51.462
and I ran here.

07:51.465 --> 07:53.827
One of 'em jumped me, and
pushed this goddamn thing

07:53.829 --> 07:55.562
into my stomach right
before I crawled in.

07:59.935 --> 08:01.668
This is gonna sound insane.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.704
No, trust me. It won't.

08:03.706 --> 08:05.706
They knew me.

08:06.976 --> 08:08.876
They said it was for Ricky Gustavo.

08:08.878 --> 08:10.711
Remember that kid I used
to beat up in school?

08:10.713 --> 08:12.479
Yeah.

08:12.481 --> 08:14.915
They talked about stuff
they couldn't have known.

08:17.419 --> 08:19.253
Whatever's out there...

08:21.123 --> 08:24.291
it messes with your head.

08:24.293 --> 08:26.593
I don't even know what's real anymore.

08:28.531 --> 08:30.297
I'm real.

08:30.299 --> 08:32.533
Prove it.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.701
You think I'm a pretentious asshole,

08:34.703 --> 08:38.515
and I think you hide your
insecurities with aggression.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.107
Okay, it's you, all right.

08:50.519 --> 08:52.519
What the hell is going on?

08:54.513 --> 08:58.992
We're dying. That's what's going on.

08:58.994 --> 09:01.795
Or at least I'm dying,
anyway, that's for sure.

09:01.797 --> 09:03.196
You're not dying.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.967
Meds are wearing off.

09:06.969 --> 09:09.102
According to Dr.
Bailey, I'm just waiting

09:09.104 --> 09:10.871
for an infection that's gonna kill me.

09:15.010 --> 09:17.044
You still think I'm not dying, kiddo?

09:29.445 --> 09:32.513
[Chuckles]

09:32.515 --> 09:35.103
That's some shit-eating grin you got.

09:35.106 --> 09:36.817
Are we sure it's not brain damage?

09:36.819 --> 09:38.061
Easy, kid.

09:38.064 --> 09:39.821
Yeah, kid.

09:46.762 --> 09:48.028
Can you move?

09:48.031 --> 09:49.273
Ish.

09:51.234 --> 09:53.000
MIA: Not too long.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.315
And I'm out.

10:09.752 --> 10:13.053
You know, so you two
can make sweet love.

10:29.905 --> 10:31.038
Hey.

10:34.744 --> 10:36.543
I'm not...

10:36.545 --> 10:38.879
I'm not ready for you to be nice to me.

10:40.983 --> 10:43.217
Then what should I do?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.253
Just get some rest.

11:16.619 --> 11:19.687
Where have you been? Bryan's awake.

11:19.689 --> 11:22.423
I, uh... My brother's here.

11:25.261 --> 11:26.460
Is it bad?

11:26.462 --> 11:29.630
Yeah. It's pretty bad.

11:31.733 --> 11:35.668
What now? Do we move on?

11:35.671 --> 11:36.904
Not yet.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.710
What?

11:42.712 --> 11:47.581
Just from what Alex has told me,

11:47.583 --> 11:49.783
I didn't think you guys were...

11:50.920 --> 11:52.086
close.

11:53.522 --> 11:54.955
We're not...

11:57.354 --> 11:58.620
but we used to be.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.106
Pervert.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.814
Yep.

12:08.816 --> 12:12.084
Sorry. You'll have
to entertain yourself.

12:12.086 --> 12:15.020
Not a home till all my books are up.

12:15.022 --> 12:17.122
I just wanted to ask you something.

12:17.124 --> 12:19.625
As long as it doesn't stop me working.

12:24.231 --> 12:26.732
What'd you mean before,

12:26.734 --> 12:29.301
when you said you'd never been less you?

12:29.303 --> 12:32.170
Sweet. You've been
all concerned about me.

12:32.172 --> 12:35.274
No, I'm not concerned, just curious.

12:36.343 --> 12:38.310
What did you mean?

12:39.847 --> 12:41.947
All women are two people.

12:41.949 --> 12:44.550
[Chuckles]

12:44.553 --> 12:46.847
Here. Read "Madame Bovary."

12:46.850 --> 12:48.583
Oh, please don't jump off a cliff.

12:48.586 --> 12:50.019
[Laughs]

12:50.022 --> 12:51.924
You're thinking of "Wuthering Heights,"

12:51.926 --> 12:54.092
and nobody jumps off a cliff.

12:54.094 --> 12:56.428
Okay, well, then explain
it in a nonliterary fashion.

12:56.430 --> 12:57.996
I write about owls, remember?

13:00.801 --> 13:03.669
You know who I was before I met you.

13:04.705 --> 13:06.305
Do I?

13:06.307 --> 13:08.944
I was dating guys in
your brother's crowd.

13:08.947 --> 13:10.781
The bad guys.

13:10.784 --> 13:14.085
Bad guys were very
popular or so I remember.

13:17.959 --> 13:20.352
And I still am that girl,

13:20.354 --> 13:24.940
but I'm also not, 'cause I met you.

13:24.943 --> 13:27.692
And if I hadn't, I'd still be partying,

13:27.695 --> 13:29.948
going from guy to guy,

13:29.951 --> 13:31.763
certainly wouldn't have been a teacher,

13:31.765 --> 13:33.031
'cause no one...

13:34.568 --> 13:37.035
no one thought I had
anything to offer...

13:39.340 --> 13:40.706
but you.

13:42.776 --> 13:44.543
I'm such a hero.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.316
My hero.

13:54.488 --> 13:57.422
Here. Drink this.

13:57.424 --> 13:59.925
Oh, yeah, water. That'll
take the pain away.

14:00.995 --> 14:02.861
[Gags] Oh, crap!

14:02.863 --> 14:04.596
- Shit.
- Oh, shit!

14:04.598 --> 14:07.065
[Groans]

14:07.067 --> 14:08.892
What can I do?

14:08.895 --> 14:11.403
You can't do shit.

14:13.107 --> 14:16.008
Bailey gave me the last of the meds.

14:16.010 --> 14:17.909
There's nothing left for me but pain.

14:20.588 --> 14:21.720
[Sighs]

14:25.386 --> 14:27.252
Where's Eve and Alex?

14:28.756 --> 14:30.756
Last I heard, they were at the mall.

14:35.195 --> 14:37.929
I'm sorry for what happened to Alex.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.433
I hope she'll be okay.

14:41.435 --> 14:44.536
She's a great kid. I'll give you that.

14:44.538 --> 14:46.638
Thanks.

14:49.981 --> 14:52.114
I noticed after years
of being so certain,

14:52.117 --> 14:53.612
all of a sudden, you're carrying.

14:53.614 --> 14:55.180
[Sighs]

14:55.182 --> 14:57.149
That's what you want
to discuss right now?

14:57.151 --> 14:58.917
You shot anybody?

15:01.155 --> 15:03.088
You think you can?

15:03.090 --> 15:05.590
I don't want to.

15:06.927 --> 15:08.694
Never gonna make it.

15:08.696 --> 15:11.096
I made it so far.

15:11.098 --> 15:13.532
You should practice.

15:13.534 --> 15:16.201
Practice killing people?

15:16.203 --> 15:17.969
What are you talking about?

15:21.442 --> 15:22.708
[Crying]

15:22.710 --> 15:24.580
Jesus, Mike, no.

15:24.583 --> 15:27.679
I'm in so much goddamn pain.

15:30.017 --> 15:31.883
And it's not gonna stop.

15:31.885 --> 15:33.719
I'm not killing you. Are you insane?

15:33.721 --> 15:35.721
You don't like me, anyway.

It won't be hard.

Please.

15:45.247 --> 15:46.594

16:11.733 --> 16:15.523

in the woods? You remember him?

16:15.525 --> 16:17.725

that we already were...

16:19.562 --> 16:21.195
This is worse than the pain.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.231
He took the knife,
and he cut his own arm.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.186
You remember?

16:24.189 --> 16:27.400
And he kept saying, "It's just blood.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.669
It's just blood."

16:28.671 --> 16:32.006
And then you grabbed
me, and we ran away.

16:32.008 --> 16:33.407
I regret that now, by the way.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.611
And I was so scared afterwards,

16:36.613 --> 16:38.780

16:38.782 --> 16:41.082
Yeah. That's, uh...

19:40.196 --> 19:41.996
I just was in the mood.

19:46.469 --> 19:48.035
Dr. Bailey.

19:49.305 --> 19:50.905
I need your help with my brother.

19:50.907 --> 19:52.473
Your brother?

19:52.475 --> 19:55.810
Man in 132 with the,
uh, rebar in his stomach.

19:55.812 --> 19:57.511
I didn't know who he was. I'm sorry.

19:57.513 --> 20:00.147
Look, there's gotta be
something you can do for him.

20:00.149 --> 20:01.983
The O.R.'s in the east wing.

20:01.985 --> 20:04.085
I mean, you were able to help Bryan.

20:04.087 --> 20:06.587
Yeah, but based on the
location of the injury,

20:06.589 --> 20:09.987
odds are the rebar is
in your brother's liver.

20:09.990 --> 20:11.991
The only thing that keeps
him from bleeding to death

20:11.993 --> 20:13.719
is the pressure that
the rebar is exerting

20:13.722 --> 20:15.129
against the liver's blood vessels.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.897
Now, I can take it out,
sure, but I can't stop

20:16.899 --> 20:18.466
that kind of bleeding
without a clotting agent,

20:18.468 --> 20:19.633
and I need a sterile environment,

20:19.635 --> 20:21.569
and all of that is in the O.R.

20:21.571 --> 20:22.888
Then we go there.

20:22.891 --> 20:24.138
Mr. Copeland, I don't think...

20:24.140 --> 20:26.013

through the mist before.

- How far away is it?

20:28.111 --> 20:30.411
I don't know. Maybe 300 feet.

20:30.413 --> 20:31.946
Okay, we can do that.

could you talk me through it?

Mr. Copeland, you're not...

20:45.374 --> 20:46.927
If I can get him there
and I had you on a walkie

20:46.929 --> 20:48.496
or something like that, is it possible?

20:48.498 --> 20:50.331
Without a sonogram,

20:50.333 --> 20:52.933
there's no way of fully
knowing what we're doing.

20:52.935 --> 20:54.568
You could cause an arterial bleed

20:54.570 --> 20:56.137
or... or a million other variables,

20:56.139 --> 20:57.756
all of them leading to death.

20:57.759 --> 20:58.992
And if he stays here?

21:02.111 --> 21:05.546
He'll die from infection...
sooner or later.

21:07.984 --> 21:10.084

guess Dr. Bailey moved him.

34:32.091 --> 34:33.757
Absolutely.

34:35.594 --> 34:37.594
- You ready?
- Are you?

34:52.878 --> 34:55.145
Ah, shit! Ohh!

34:55.147 --> 34:57.914
[Groaning] How far away is it?

34:57.916 --> 35:00.250
Almost there. It's just down at the end.

35:00.252 --> 35:02.319
Kevin, what's on my face?

35:02.321 --> 35:03.787
I can't feel...

35:09.828 --> 35:12.195
[Grunts] God.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.163
[Groaning]

35:14.900 --> 35:18.235
Okay, we made it.

35:18.237 --> 35:20.036
All right.

35:20.038 --> 35:21.905
- [Gasping]
- Let's do this.

35:31.270 --> 35:34.486
All right. Are you ready?

35:36.723 --> 35:38.424
We were all in love with her, you know.

35:38.426 --> 35:40.592
What? What are you talking about?

35:40.594 --> 35:42.594
We were all in love with Eve.

35:42.596 --> 35:46.059
I know I was. How couldn't we be?

35:46.062 --> 35:47.394
Such a strange creature.

35:52.229 --> 35:53.796
And then you came along...

35:55.020 --> 35:57.843
and you reached her.

35:57.845 --> 36:00.612
How could I not hate you for that?

36:06.420 --> 36:07.886
Let's do this.

36:09.339 --> 36:11.773
I'll get Dr. Bailey then. You there?

36:11.775 --> 36:13.408
- Yeah, I'm here.
- We're ready.

36:13.410 --> 36:15.677
Did you clean the area with Betadine?

36:15.679 --> 36:18.379
- Mm-hmm, all over.
- Did you prep the lidocaine?

36:18.381 --> 36:20.014
- Yeah.
- Okay.

36:20.016 --> 36:21.616
Inject it around the wound.

36:23.353 --> 36:24.352
How close?

36:24.354 --> 36:25.954
Right around the edge.

36:29.726 --> 36:31.292
[Groaning]

36:31.294 --> 36:34.028
[Agonized Panting]

36:35.832 --> 36:38.032
[Wincing]

36:38.034 --> 36:40.234
Oh, shit.

36:40.236 --> 36:42.904
All right, that's done, I think.

36:42.906 --> 36:45.273
The area should be numb by now.

36:45.275 --> 36:46.474
You feel that?

36:46.476 --> 36:47.742
- Mm-mm.
- No?

36:47.744 --> 36:49.077
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, good.

36:49.079 --> 36:50.812
Uh, all right, what next?

36:50.814 --> 36:54.233
Use the scalpel as if you were drawing

36:54.236 --> 36:56.803
a straight line through the rebar.

36:56.806 --> 36:58.940
Go three inches on either side of it.

37:00.090 --> 37:01.489
Okay.

37:01.492 --> 37:03.214
MIKE: Oh, my God.

37:11.601 --> 37:13.001
Okay.

37:13.003 --> 37:14.669
All right, I think I... That's it.

37:14.671 --> 37:16.170
Tell me what you see.

37:16.172 --> 37:19.807
Uh, I see the rebar, and it's in...

37:19.809 --> 37:22.744
Sticking out of, like, a
reddish-brown substance.

37:22.746 --> 37:23.978
That's the liver.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.680
- Get the retractors.
- Okay.

37:25.682 --> 37:27.649
All right, I got the retractors.

37:27.651 --> 37:30.018
Get ready to pull it out of the liver.

37:30.020 --> 37:31.319
Get the clotting sponges ready,

37:31.321 --> 37:33.454
and be prepared to hold firm pressure.

37:33.456 --> 37:35.123
There's gonna be real bleeding.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.445
Right. I'm gonna need your help.

37:37.327 --> 37:38.860
Mike, you gotta hold on to this.

37:38.862 --> 37:40.261
[Grunting]

37:40.263 --> 37:41.663
Yep. Don't look.

37:41.665 --> 37:44.298
Okay. All right, just
hold it right there.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.333
All right, I'm ready.

37:45.335 --> 37:47.435
Okay.

37:47.437 --> 37:48.369
Now pull.

37:51.441 --> 37:52.607
[Groaning]

37:55.111 --> 37:58.012
It's out! It's out.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.313
Okay.

38:00.550 --> 38:03.151
Okay, now the clotting sponge.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.856
It doesn't... It won't stop bleeding!

38:08.858 --> 38:10.224
Use more clotting sponges.

38:14.464 --> 38:15.897
[Groaning]

38:17.367 --> 38:18.566
All right, it's stopping.

38:18.568 --> 38:20.068
It's stopping.

38:20.070 --> 38:23.106
Use the staples to
close the incision site.

38:23.109 --> 38:25.006
All right. Okay, fine.

38:25.008 --> 38:26.474
All right. All right. All right.

38:27.644 --> 38:28.810
I'm sorry.

38:30.647 --> 38:34.248
[Staples Clacking]

38:37.587 --> 38:38.753
Okay.

38:40.390 --> 38:41.522
That's it.

38:42.985 --> 38:44.384
Now get back here with him.

38:44.387 --> 38:46.060
[Mike Laughs]

38:46.062 --> 38:47.195
See you soon.

39:02.912 --> 39:04.445
Who's the father?

39:09.686 --> 39:11.185
Thought you didn't want to know.

39:13.723 --> 39:14.889
Thought it didn't matter.

39:17.761 --> 39:19.227
Doesn't.

39:22.999 --> 39:26.701
But we can't tell her it's not me.

39:26.703 --> 39:28.302
You have to promise me that.

39:31.808 --> 39:33.474
Agreed.

39:34.711 --> 39:35.810
She adores you.

39:35.812 --> 39:37.111
It would break her heart.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.112
[Door Opens]

39:38.114 --> 39:39.747
Daddy! Mommy!

39:41.918 --> 39:43.384
Daddy! Mommy!

39:45.221 --> 39:48.689
Nathalie showed me a snake!

39:48.691 --> 39:50.925
- It was a larva.
- She said that it's

39:50.927 --> 39:53.728
gonna turn into a
beautiful moth someday.

39:55.732 --> 39:57.331
[Laughs]

39:58.401 --> 40:00.067
[Laughs]

40:05.642 --> 40:07.742
I'm not gonna see him again.

40:13.983 --> 40:15.449
Thank you.

40:19.122 --> 40:21.088
I would do anything for you.

40:22.458 --> 40:24.125
You know that, right?

40:27.384 --> 40:28.417
Hang on.

40:28.420 --> 40:29.463
It's okay.

40:29.465 --> 40:31.265
[Mike Shuddering]

40:32.302 --> 40:33.634
Hang on.

40:36.272 --> 40:39.306
It's just blood. It's just blood.

40:39.309 --> 40:40.775
[Groaning]

40:45.882 --> 40:47.181
[Grunts]

40:47.183 --> 40:48.449
- Mike!
- Kevin!

40:48.451 --> 40:50.551
[Screams]

40:50.553 --> 40:52.887
All right, hold on! Let
me see if I can help.

40:57.227 --> 40:58.893
- Oh!
- Hold on.

40:58.895 --> 41:01.295
You all right? You all right? I got you.

41:01.297 --> 41:02.396
[Buzzing]

41:02.398 --> 41:04.464
What... What the hell is that?

41:04.467 --> 41:06.567
What... What are those things?

41:06.569 --> 41:09.003
Damn it! What... What's going on?

41:09.005 --> 41:10.137
Oh, shit!

41:11.307 --> 41:13.841
Damn it! Shit!

41:13.843 --> 41:17.511
Aah! [Incoherent Raving]

41:20.884 --> 41:22.250
Come on, let me get you up there.

41:22.252 --> 41:24.385
- Come on!
- They're crawling inside me!

41:24.387 --> 41:29.090
Aah! Aah! Get them off me, Kevin!

41:29.092 --> 41:30.992
[Agonized Scream]

41:30.994 --> 41:34.395
I'll get you out, I'll get you out!

41:34.397 --> 41:38.699
[Groaning]

41:38.701 --> 41:39.759
I'm too heavy, Kevin!

41:41.104 --> 41:43.004
You wanna die, too?

41:43.006 --> 41:45.172
You have to get to Eve!

41:45.174 --> 41:46.107
Go!

41:48.811 --> 41:50.778
[Sobbing]

41:56.052 --> 41:58.052
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

42:03.092 --> 42:04.392
[Gunshot]

42:18.638 --> 42:20.004
Anything.
