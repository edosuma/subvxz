Huh?

24:37.041 --> 24:38.000
[boy squeals]

24:38.083 --> 24:38.916
[Farhad] Wait!

24:40.041 --> 24:40.916
I know...

24:46.666 --> 24:48.416
-I know who took the money.
-Who?

24:48.500 --> 24:50.125
-Sanjib.
-Who's Sanjib?

24:50.208 --> 24:52.500
You just threw him off the roof.

24:52.875 --> 24:53.708
[chuckles]

24:56.166 --> 24:57.166
Come here.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.291
What's your name?

25:06.666 --> 25:07.500
Farhad.

25:07.916 --> 25:08.916
Farhad?

25:10.416 --> 25:12.333
You're pretty clever.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.083
Pay attention...

25:17.458 --> 25:18.333
and learn...

25:19.083 --> 25:20.666
that's how you survive.

25:21.250 --> 25:24.750
You need to be smart. Use your wits.

25:25.833 --> 25:27.708
Eh, Farhad?

25:40.583 --> 25:42.041
Cut off two of your fingers.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.583
Any two.

25:45.083 --> 25:45.916
Why?

25:46.000 --> 25:50.666
Because the kid who stole from me is dead.

25:51.333 --> 25:53.875
And I'd like a walking reminder

25:54.375 --> 25:57.500
of what happens when you touch my money.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.458
I'd recommend the left hand.

26:05.125 --> 26:08.500
So you can still hold a gun.

26:16.166 --> 26:17.000
[colonel] Amir!

26:17.083 --> 26:18.416

Amir, we lost the kid.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.375
[tsks]

26:28.833 --> 26:31.750
Clever and lucky...

26:38.500 --> 26:39.916
Close the city.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.791
Bridges, trains, airports...

26:41.875 --> 26:43.166
Close everything.

26:43.750 --> 26:44.833
Impossible, Amir.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.750
Make it possible, Colonel,

26:53.666 --> 26:56.250
or you'll lose more than just a finger.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.125
Hmm?

27:17.958 --> 27:20.083
Okay, get out. Let's go.

47:38.750 --> 47:41.541
One is seriously injured.

47:44.791 --> 47:49.416
I want every gun in Dhaka
pointed at this guy.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.791
All right. Close the door.
Close the door.

[panting and groaning]

48:45.833 --> 48:46.791
Can you give me a hand?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.958
I need eyes. Hold that on there.

48:52.583 --> 48:55.041
Just hook it through there
and then pull it back this way.

48:55.125 --> 48:55.958
Yeah.

48:59.333 --> 49:00.166
[groans loudly]

49:49.583 --> 49:50.541
He's with me.

49:52.125 --> 49:54.791
There's a clearing on east side

49:59.666 --> 50:02.416
-How far?
<i>-Four kilometers.</i>

50:06.416 --> 50:08.333
You gotta leave the kid behind, Tyler.

50:24.250 --> 50:25.208
Tyler?

50:28.958 --> 50:29.958
That's not the job.

50:30.041 --> 50:31.500
The job is fucked.

50:36.791 --> 50:38.375
Just find my money, Nik.

50:50.375 --> 50:52.541
[Ovi] Are you gonna
leave me in the street?

50:55.166 --> 50:57.166
Your phone... It's loud.

50:59.916 --> 51:02.666
The only chance
of getting my money is you, mate. So...

51:03.916 --> 51:04.916
no.

51:08.750 --> 51:10.125
I'm like a package then.

51:12.250 --> 51:13.333
Yeah, pretty much.

51:14.791 --> 51:16.291
In brown paper.

51:25.625 --> 51:26.708
What are you doing?

51:27.333 --> 51:28.166
This?

51:29.083 --> 51:32.958
Piano. I play the piano when I'm nervous.

51:34.375 --> 51:35.208
It helps.

51:36.958 --> 51:38.666
My father hates it when I do it.

51:44.125 --> 51:46.083
He thinks of me the same way you do.

51:48.416 --> 51:50.041
More like a thing than a person.

51:55.500 --> 51:57.625
I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

We're in the worst smelling sewer

Just call Gaspar.

Good to see you, man.

1:01:44.916 --> 1:01:46.333
I appreciate you coming for us.

Uh, he's resting.

1:01:58.666 --> 1:01:59.833
So, where are we?

1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:03.916
We are south of the city center.

1:02:04.416 --> 1:02:08.875
I told Nik that an extraction is...
It's not feasible.

1:02:08.958 --> 1:02:11.416
Well, you know, the city
is surrounded by rivers.

1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:13.083
There are bridges going in and out.

1:02:13.166 --> 1:02:18.416
But every one of those bridges currently
is blocked by a roadblock

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.833
because you are a very popular individual.

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:28.250
I figure we lie low a couple days,
we let the panic dissipate.

1:02:28.333 --> 1:02:33.500
And we'll get you going.
Now, my wife made that.

1:02:33.583 --> 1:02:35.583
So, I want you to be very careful
what you say.

1:02:36.416 --> 1:02:37.416
Your wife?

1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:38.625

1:02:40.125 --> 1:02:41.458
And what's that for, the knee?

1:02:42.083 --> 1:02:44.333
Yeah, knee, back, shoulder...

1:02:44.875 --> 1:02:49.208
Hang on one sec... my knee.
Ow! Oh, God. Oh, it hurts.

1:02:50.166 --> 1:02:51.458
Two oughta do it.

1:02:55.833 --> 1:02:56.875
[swallows and exhales]

1:02:56.958 --> 1:02:59.625
Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go.

1:03:00.125 --> 1:03:01.583
I gotta kiss my wife.

1:03:02.583 --> 1:03:06.666
But you stay here and rest up.
And I will be back.

1:03:09.333 --> 1:03:11.791

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.083
-[Farhad] I had him...
-[Asif] Had who?

1:04:20.166 --> 1:04:21.833
The man you want.

1:04:22.416 --> 1:04:24.416
I lost him...

1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:25.625
near the market.

1:04:26.625 --> 1:04:28.625
Tell them to scour the market.

1:04:28.708 --> 1:04:29.916
[Shadek] Yes, sir.

1:04:39.250 --> 1:04:41.291
-What is this?
-A gift.

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.500
When you catch him,

1:04:44.583 --> 1:04:46.666
I want to be the one to pull the trigger.

1:04:47.333 --> 1:04:49.541
If you let me do that,

1:04:50.125 --> 1:04:52.666
I'll give you the other finger!

1:05:08.750 --> 1:05:09.958
He made me feel like a fool.

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:12.708
Of course he did.

1:05:16.125 --> 1:05:18.458
You're only a kid. Hmm?

1:05:37.208 --> 1:05:41.333
Here's some advice, a gift.

1:05:43.333 --> 1:05:46.583
Keep your other finger.

1:05:47.250 --> 1:05:51.125
Because no matter how badass
you think you are...

1:05:51.750 --> 1:05:55.458
there's always a badass
who's bigger than you.

1:06:13.833 --> 1:06:14.916
[Tyler exhales heavily]

1:06:19.125 --> 1:06:20.125
[Ovi] Tyler.

1:06:22.375 --> 1:06:23.250
Yeah?

1:06:24.916 --> 1:06:28.791
If you had been killed today,
it would have been my fault.

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.750
No, mate. But it would've been my fault.

1:06:36.666 --> 1:06:38.208
You don't look like a Tyler.

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:40.541
[chuckles softly]

1:06:41.041 --> 1:06:42.208
No?

1:06:42.291 --> 1:06:43.333
What do I look like?

1:06:46.416 --> 1:06:47.250
A Brad.

1:06:48.083 --> 1:06:49.166
[chuckles]

1:06:51.875 --> 1:06:52.750
Yeah.

1:06:56.500 --> 1:06:58.000
Can I ask you something?

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:00.500
It's Rake.

1:07:01.250 --> 1:07:03.208
-What's Rake?
-My last name.

1:07:04.208 --> 1:07:05.916
That's not what I was going to ask.

1:07:07.125 --> 1:07:08.875
That's a strange last name, though.

1:07:10.208 --> 1:07:12.125
Isn't that like a gardening tool?

1:07:16.291 --> 1:07:17.500
What were you gonna ask me?

1:07:19.666 --> 1:07:25.666
If you were always this way.
You know... brave.

1:07:26.291 --> 1:07:27.666
I'm not brave, mate.

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:33.291
Of course you are. You rescue people.

1:07:34.666 --> 1:07:38.666
Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes I do other things.

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:42.875
Like killing people?

1:07:45.791 --> 1:07:46.666
Yeah.

1:07:48.333 --> 1:07:51.166
My father, he kills people, too.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:58.791
Sometimes, I would sit with him at dinner,
look at him and think,

1:08:00.416 --> 1:08:02.750
he just killed somebody else's father
that day.

1:08:04.541 --> 1:08:05.791
And I'd feel sick.

1:08:25.041 --> 1:08:26.458
You have a family?

1:08:29.083 --> 1:08:31.250
I did have me a wife.

1:08:32.166 --> 1:08:33.208
Where is she?

1:08:34.208 --> 1:08:37.791
I don't know.
I haven't seen her in a long time.

1:08:39.833 --> 1:08:41.083
Children?

1:08:43.416 --> 1:08:44.625
Yeah, a son.

1:08:46.125 --> 1:08:47.208
Where is he?

1:08:53.375 --> 1:08:55.208
He died a few years ago.

1:08:58.500 --> 1:08:59.625
How did he die?

1:09:02.041 --> 1:09:03.041
Lymphoma.

1:09:12.041 --> 1:09:13.041
How old was he?

1:09:16.625 --> 1:09:17.541
Six.

1:09:21.916 --> 1:09:23.291
[breath trembling]

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:25.375
[scoffs]

1:09:26.916 --> 1:09:30.875
I wasn't even there... when he died.

1:09:33.333 --> 1:09:34.750
Where were you?

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.125
Kandahar, Afghanistan.
It was my third tour.

1:09:42.208 --> 1:09:43.375
You were called away?

1:09:52.208 --> 1:09:53.166
No.

1:09:57.875 --> 1:09:59.000
I left.

1:10:01.833 --> 1:10:02.958
Voluntary.

1:10:07.875 --> 1:10:09.250
Because you couldn't watch?

1:10:15.125 --> 1:10:15.958
Yep.

1:10:23.250 --> 1:10:25.625
I told you, mate. I'm not brave.
I'm just...

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:28.916
I'm just the opposite.

1:10:32.375 --> 1:10:33.208
You know...

1:10:36.875 --> 1:10:41.333
"You drown not by falling into the river,

1:10:43.041 --> 1:10:44.875
but by staying submerged in it."

1:10:49.541 --> 1:10:50.916
Who told you that?

1:10:52.083 --> 1:10:53.750
I read it in a book in school.

1:11:17.916 --> 1:11:19.500
[vehicle approaching]

1:11:31.791 --> 1:11:35.875
[in Spanish] <i>Estancia Los Chanares.</i>

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:38.208
-[in English] Yes. Yes!
-[chuckles] I don't know...

1:11:38.291 --> 1:11:39.916
It's the best dove hunting in Argentina.

1:11:40.583 --> 1:11:44.208
Just lie in this pool...
You lie in a pool and they fly around!

1:11:44.291 --> 1:11:45.750
[mimics wings flapping]

1:11:45.833 --> 1:11:48.458
And you shoot them. [mimics gun firing]

1:11:48.541 --> 1:11:50.166
And you sip a Cuba Libre.

1:11:51.208 --> 1:11:55.458
I shot my first dove when I was
ten years old. Have I told you this?

1:11:55.541 --> 1:11:57.416
-I haven't. Listen.
-I think you have.

1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:02.083
No. It was when I was ten years old,
my dad... My dad... The gun backfired,

1:12:02.166 --> 1:12:05.000
gave me a black eye,
and my dad laughs at me.

1:12:05.083 --> 1:12:09.083
I used to move so quick,
kill those little shits.

1:12:10.375 --> 1:12:11.291
Not anymore, though.

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:14.916
It sucks getting old, man. Sucks!

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.833
-[loudly] Getting old sucks.
-Shh.

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:18.208
[softly] Sucks!

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.250
I think he's asleep.

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:27.541
What a goddamn tragedy, hmm?

1:12:31.416 --> 1:12:33.666
That kid is a walking corpse.

1:12:40.416 --> 1:12:42.083
Asif will never let him live.

1:12:44.041 --> 1:12:45.291
Think the disgrace.

1:12:46.375 --> 1:12:50.708
I mean, you get him home. And then, what?
His father's in prison.

1:12:52.041 --> 1:12:53.541
There's no way to protect him.

1:12:57.541 --> 1:12:59.125
You know what the best thing
you could do?

1:12:59.208 --> 1:13:02.125
The best thing you could do, honestly,
would be to go up there right now

1:13:02.916 --> 1:13:05.916
and just go put a bullet in his brain.
Make it painless.

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.583
'Cause the animals out there,
they're not gonna be... as kind to him.

1:13:14.875 --> 1:13:16.541
They like to start with the ears.

1:13:17.875 --> 1:13:20.666
Then they cut off
each finger at the joint.

1:13:20.750 --> 1:13:21.833
Mate, you're drunk.

1:13:25.333 --> 1:13:27.416
I'm talking about mercy, Tyler.

1:13:36.250 --> 1:13:37.791
You know how much he's worth?

1:13:39.208 --> 1:13:40.541
We're talking about a kid, Gaspar.

1:13:40.625 --> 1:13:42.500
We're talking about a gangster's kid.

1:13:44.708 --> 1:13:46.541
With a price tag
of ten million on his head.

1:13:46.625 --> 1:13:48.166
You need to sober up, mate.

1:13:49.541 --> 1:13:53.875
You're a mercenary, right, Tyler?
Why don't you act the mercenary?

1:13:54.833 --> 1:13:57.458
Aren't you sick of this life?
'Cause I am and I...

1:13:58.833 --> 1:14:03.666
I do not wanna end it playing hero
on some goddamn suicide mission--

1:14:03.750 --> 1:14:05.541
What are you doing?
You said you'd help me.

1:14:05.625 --> 1:14:08.708
I am helping you. Ten million dollars.

1:14:10.375 --> 1:14:12.333
I'll get you to the border
in a couple hours.

1:14:12.416 --> 1:14:16.708
It's money in your pocket.
I take care of the body. Painless.

1:14:16.791 --> 1:14:18.583
And it's the best that
that kid can hope for.

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:21.958
Did you call someone?

1:14:22.666 --> 1:14:23.916
-[groans]
-Who'd you call?

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:27.583
Why are you such a hypocrite? You've got
the blood of a hundred men on your hands--

1:14:27.666 --> 1:14:28.500
[grunts] Answer me!

1:14:30.083 --> 1:14:32.375
[panting] Put your hands on me?

1:14:32.458 --> 1:14:33.416
What'd you do?

1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:37.000
Do you know what happens to me
if they find out that I'm helping you?

1:14:37.083 --> 1:14:39.083
You know what happens to my wife?

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:41.583
Asif's a friend.

1:14:42.916 --> 1:14:45.291
I did some work for him.
We made a deal.

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.958
He gets the kid, you get your freedom,
and we both get rich.

1:14:50.041 --> 1:14:52.500
What do you want from me?
Walk upstairs and shoot the kid

1:14:52.583 --> 1:14:53.625
in the fucking head?

1:14:53.708 --> 1:14:57.375
No. No. I'll do it.

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:04.250
Don't do this.

1:15:04.333 --> 1:15:05.666
You saved my life once.

1:15:08.458 --> 1:15:09.666
Now I'm gonna save yours.

1:15:12.250 --> 1:15:13.375
Step aside.

1:15:17.083 --> 1:15:18.541
[both grunting]

1:15:38.875 --> 1:15:40.500
Come on, Tyler. Stop!

1:15:43.750 --> 1:15:44.708

1:15:56.750 --> 1:15:58.000
[panting]

1:16:00.333 --> 1:16:02.333
What are we doing, man? Huh?

1:16:04.166 --> 1:16:05.500
Come on, stay down.

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:06.958
Stay down.

1:16:08.083 --> 1:16:09.166

1:16:26.208 --> 1:16:27.083
Hey, kid.

1:16:39.041 --> 1:16:41.875
I know it looks bad. I know it looks bad.

1:16:48.208 --> 1:16:49.250

[shuddering]

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:08.416
[shakily] I want to go home.

1:18:19.750 --> 1:18:20.958
I'll get you home, mate.

1:18:26.166 --> 1:18:27.250
I'll get you home.

1:18:36.250 --> 1:18:37.416
[cell phone vibrating]

1:18:48.250 --> 1:18:51.458
[Tyler]<i> I've got the boy.</i>

1:18:57.208 --> 1:18:59.583
[prayer chant playing over speakers]

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:22.791
Stay here.

1:19:57.625 --> 1:19:58.458
Just like that?

1:19:59.250 --> 1:20:00.708
Yeah, just like that.

1:20:01.250 --> 1:20:03.708
I want the boy out of here.
That's all I care about.

1:20:05.208 --> 1:20:06.041
Why?

1:20:07.291 --> 1:20:08.250
'Cause I do.

1:20:13.041 --> 1:20:15.875
He was gonna kill my family
if I didn't get his son back.

1:20:26.708 --> 1:20:28.458
My people are waiting for him
on the other side

1:20:28.541 --> 1:20:29.958
of the Sultana Kamal bridge.

1:20:30.666 --> 1:20:32.875
There's two blockades
between here and there.

1:20:32.958 --> 1:20:34.833
I'll do my best
to draw them away from both.

1:20:45.208 --> 1:20:46.750
You get him to the other side.

1:20:55.541 --> 1:20:56.375
