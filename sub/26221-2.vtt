.

00:02.209 --> 00:03.040
[bright tones]

00:05.089 --> 00:08.050
- We all need a way

00:05.089 --> 00:08.050
to reset our souls, don't we?

00:08.050 --> 00:09.130
Yeah, I don't have time

00:09.130 --> 00:12.000
to do yoga on the beach

00:09.130 --> 00:12.000
at sunset.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.080
This is my idea

00:12.000 --> 00:14.080
of relaxation.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.129
I call this pose

00:14.080 --> 00:16.129
"the reclining pig."

00:16.129 --> 00:18.079
I get to hold it

00:16.129 --> 00:18.079
for 20 minutes a day

00:18.079 --> 00:19.170
when the kids

00:18.079 --> 00:19.170
are finally asleep

00:19.170 --> 00:21.010
and David's in the shower.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.160
It's the only "me" time I get

00:22.160 --> 00:24.210
because for every

00:22.160 --> 00:24.210
other minute of every day,

00:24.210 --> 00:26.210
someone needs me.

00:26.210 --> 00:28.079
- Oh, Emet! Emet!

00:26.210 --> 00:28.079
We need you!

00:28.079 --> 00:30.039
Our VR game designs

00:28.079 --> 00:30.039
need to be approved

00:30.039 --> 00:31.129
before the concept meeting

00:30.039 --> 00:31.129
tomorrow.

00:31.129 --> 00:33.200
- You guys were supposed

00:31.129 --> 00:33.200
to get me those by 3:00.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.090
- Whoa, pretty demanding

00:35.090 --> 00:38.009
for someone who took her

00:35.090 --> 00:38.009
sweet-ass time at lunch today.

00:38.009 --> 00:39.219
- I took my baby to the doctor.

00:39.219 --> 00:41.130
I held him down

00:39.219 --> 00:41.130
while he got shots.

00:41.130 --> 00:42.210
- You came back

00:41.130 --> 00:42.210
with a lollipop.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.219
It couldn't have been that bad.

00:43.219 --> 00:46.100
- The lollipop was my lunch.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.020
[sighs] Okay, all right.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.020
Go ahead.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.179
Put it on the pile. I got this.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.179
Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.170
Home stretch until I get

00:49.179 --> 00:51.170
to my 20 minutes.

00:51.170 --> 00:53.090
I just have to make dinner,

00:51.170 --> 00:53.090
put the kids to bed,

00:53.090 --> 00:54.179
clean up,

00:53.090 --> 00:54.179
say hi to the husband--

00:54.179 --> 00:56.020
oh, and pee.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.140
Like, now.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.140
- Mom!

00:57.140 --> 00:59.140
Louie flew his helicopter

00:57.140 --> 00:59.140
into my hair!

00:59.140 --> 01:02.020
- It's no big deal, Mom.

00:59.140 --> 01:02.020
I'll go get the scissors.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.170
- No, no, no...

01:02.020 --> 01:03.170
- No, you psycho!

01:03.170 --> 01:04.219
I'll kill you!

01:04.219 --> 01:06.099
- Lily, don't call him

01:04.219 --> 01:06.099
a psycho!

01:06.099 --> 01:08.219
And Louie,

01:06.099 --> 01:08.219
stop being a psycho!

01:08.219 --> 01:10.010
- Oh, you're home.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.180
- Yeah.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.180
- Good. Listen.

01:11.180 --> 01:13.060
You know how I have trouble

01:11.180 --> 01:13.060
reading Caleb at work?

01:13.060 --> 01:14.210
- Yes.

01:13.060 --> 01:14.210
- Well, I decided that today

01:14.210 --> 01:16.049
was the day I was gonna

01:14.210 --> 01:16.049
show him my new press plan.

01:16.049 --> 01:17.170
- This is the part of my day

01:17.170 --> 01:19.129
where David spins out

01:17.170 --> 01:19.129
and I reassure.

01:19.129 --> 01:21.099
I call it putting

01:19.129 --> 01:21.099
Humpty-David

01:21.099 --> 01:22.189
back together again.

01:22.189 --> 01:24.150
- That I like--

01:24.150 --> 01:25.230
actually, that doesn't sound

01:24.150 --> 01:25.230
good either.

01:25.230 --> 01:28.060
Oh yeah, Caleb's

01:25.230 --> 01:28.060
gonna fire me.

01:28.060 --> 01:29.230
- Okay, no, no, no.

01:28.060 --> 01:29.230
Hey, hey, hey.

01:29.230 --> 01:32.189
Humpty--honey,

01:29.230 --> 01:32.189
Caleb is not firing you.

01:32.189 --> 01:35.140
You are the best PR person

01:32.189 --> 01:35.140
that airline has ever had.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.060
- I am?

01:35.140 --> 01:37.060
- Yes, they are lucky

01:37.060 --> 01:38.140
to have you.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.140
- You're right.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.030
- Yes!

01:38.140 --> 01:40.030
- Thank you, you're the best.

01:40.030 --> 01:42.030
Hey, you know what you need?

01:40.030 --> 01:42.030
- What?

01:42.030 --> 01:43.180
- How about a date night?

01:42.030 --> 01:43.180
- Yeah.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.109
- How about I just spoil you?

01:43.180 --> 01:45.109
- Yeah.

01:45.109 --> 01:46.180
- Uh-huh.

01:45.109 --> 01:46.180
So just pick a place,

01:46.180 --> 01:47.229
make a reservation,

01:46.180 --> 01:47.229
get a sitter,

01:47.229 --> 01:49.020
and I am there.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.030
Oh, I cannot wait.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.069
[doorbell rings]

01:52.069 --> 01:53.219
- Okay, I got it.

01:52.069 --> 01:53.219
I'll get it.

01:53.219 --> 01:55.219
- Hi.

01:55.219 --> 01:57.150
It's your neighbor.

01:55.219 --> 01:57.150
How are you?

01:57.150 --> 02:00.030
Listen, Emert--

01:57.150 --> 02:00.030
- It's Emet.

02:00.030 --> 02:01.159
- Oh.

02:00.030 --> 02:01.159
That's weird too.

02:01.159 --> 02:04.079
Listen, Ren and I

02:01.159 --> 02:04.079
are off to Budapest,

02:04.079 --> 02:05.200
and I was wondering

02:04.079 --> 02:05.200
if you're not, like...

02:05.200 --> 02:08.000
- Mom, she's crazy!

02:05.200 --> 02:08.000
- I'm gonna kill you!

02:08.000 --> 02:09.110
- Quiet!

02:09.110 --> 02:11.080
- If you're not too busy,

02:11.080 --> 02:12.199
would you mind bringing in

02:11.080 --> 02:12.199
our packages

02:12.199 --> 02:16.000
and then agitating our compost

02:12.199 --> 02:16.000
for us while we're gone?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.079
- This globetrotting [bleep]

02:17.079 --> 02:18.229

02:18.229 --> 02:20.030
Tell her no!

02:20.030 --> 02:21.150
Of course. I'd be happy to.

02:21.150 --> 02:23.030
What the hell is wrong with

02:21.150 --> 02:23.030
you, Emert?

02:23.030 --> 02:25.000
- Oh, my God, amazing.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.189
Thank you so much,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.189

02:27.189 --> 02:29.189
Bye!

02:27.189 --> 02:29.189
- Bye.

02:29.189 --> 02:31.120
I know this looks

02:29.189 --> 02:31.120
overwhelming,

02:31.120 --> 02:33.000
but as long as I can get

02:31.120 --> 02:33.000
my 20 minutes,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.079
I can handle anything.

Just dinner, clean-up,

We need to stay here

02:40.030 --> 02:42.000

03:01.080 --> 03:03.090
to bring my fiber?

and we can get them

Why don't you just

Okay, they are going

what my problem is.

is the same problem

03:45.050 --> 03:46.180
that all women have.

You gotta take what you want.

answer the question.

you're never gonna get

04:12.099 --> 04:14.150

You gotta manspread.

- Yeah.

See, manspreading

You're too polite

04:28.149 --> 04:30.110
to even take up your own chair.

04:30.110 --> 04:31.189

- Why can't we stay

21:20.109 --> 21:22.099
at a hotel?

21:22.099 --> 21:25.140
- What are we,

21:22.099 --> 21:25.140
white people?

21:26.150 --> 21:29.039
[both laughing]

21:29.039 --> 21:31.150
- [fake crying]

21:29.039 --> 21:31.150
- [goofy exclamations]

21:31.150 --> 21:33.150
[cheerful music]
