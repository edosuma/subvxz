00:37.137 --> 00:38.504
(laughter)

00:38.506 --> 00:40.005
Say hey, Two Dads Dave.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.508
(laughter)

00:42.510 --> 00:44.643
See you at recess,
Dump Truck Face.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.011
(mechanical whirring)

00:46.013 --> 00:47.613
(laughter)

00:49.482 --> 00:51.517
So, Rallo,
today's the day

00:51.519 --> 00:54.887
you finally drop a nickname
on the new kid, Dudley, right?

00:54.889 --> 00:57.990
Yeah, you going
physical attribute or
straight-up racial?

00:57.992 --> 00:59.425
I haven't decided.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.493
Might go both, like I did
with Rice Pee-Pee.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.930
(laughter)

01:08.334 --> 01:10.035
Everybody, quiet!

01:10.037 --> 01:11.904
Rallo's gonna
baptize Dudley!

01:14.040 --> 01:16.909
'Sup, Boog-kake?

01:16.911 --> 01:19.078
(laughter)

01:19.080 --> 01:21.780
(imitates siren wailing)

01:21.782 --> 01:24.783
Class, it's very important
that you show

01:24.785 --> 01:27.553
these letters to your parents
when you get home.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.255
This is for parents'
eyes only.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.091
Guardians don't count.

01:32.093 --> 01:32.724
But my grandmother...

01:32.726 --> 01:35.160
Is not your dead mother.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.534
There's a lice outbreak
at Rallo's school.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.036
(screams)

01:44.038 --> 01:46.071
Jump up from the couch!

01:46.073 --> 01:47.439
Relax, Cleveland.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.041
Black people hardly
ever get lice.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.210
(rustling)

01:51.212 --> 01:52.277
He's got 'em.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.380
(shudders) What's lice?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.583
Don't worry. It's just like
you've got head roaches.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.584
Well, I'll be at Mother's.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.553
I can't risk
losing this fella.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.056
We've been through
too many milkshakes together.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.390
Late!

02:05.392 --> 02:07.092
Am I gonna die, Mama?

02:07.094 --> 02:08.560
Not from lice.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.098
I love hugging you, Mommy.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.834
You're safe now.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.836
I'm not surprised
Rallo got those lices.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.738
Donna does not keep
a very clean home.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.839
It's true.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.074
I have to shower
with flip-flops.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.409
Grody.

02:24.411 --> 02:27.112
Cleveland, it's time for me
to pooch punt you
off my porch.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.580
I'm locking up
the house.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.482
Your mother and I
are off to Legoland.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.317
There's an
Empire State Building
as tall as your father!

02:32.319 --> 02:34.820
We'll see about that.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.088
Wait a minute, Dad!

02:36.090 --> 02:37.656
I can house-sit for you!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.658
Uh, no.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.426
Lavar, I didn't carry
that boy for six months

02:41.428 --> 02:42.928
to not see him grow up.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.028
All right, Cleveland, fine.

02:44.030 --> 02:44.830
You can house-sit.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.833
But same rules
as when you were a kid:

02:47.835 --> 02:49.601
no friends in the house,
and most importantly,

02:49.603 --> 02:53.605
don't even <i>think</i> of touching
my RCee Colas.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.440
Mmm. Good old-fashioned
poor people's soda.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.876
I won't let
you down, Dad!

02:57.878 --> 02:59.044
Shh.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.679
Shh.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.613
You already have.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.853
You messed with
the wrong scalp, lice!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.521
Now you better make peace
with your insect God,

03:09.523 --> 03:10.622
'cause you 'bout to die!

03:13.126 --> 03:15.861
And that's...

03:15.863 --> 03:17.196
one!

03:17.198 --> 03:18.163
(sighs)

03:18.165 --> 03:20.566
Rallo, wake up.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.501
I have to tell you
something.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.236
It's not easy
for me to say,

03:24.238 --> 03:26.705
and it's not gonna be easy
for you to hear...

03:26.707 --> 03:28.473
Roberta's
really my mom?

03:28.475 --> 03:30.142
Don't ever say that again.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.911
Baby, we're gonna have
to shave your head.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.680
(screaming)

03:34.682 --> 03:35.747
Roberta, we got a runner!

03:38.685 --> 03:40.152
(zapping)

03:40.154 --> 03:41.653
(buzzing)
(screaming)

03:43.990 --> 03:46.058
(lively conga music playing)

03:52.932 --> 03:54.533
Wait a minute.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.068
Dad said I shouldn't eat
in the study.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.202
Hmm.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.404
But I've been doing
such a good job,

03:59.406 --> 04:01.740
I deserve a snack as a award.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.841
Reward?

04:02.843 --> 04:03.942
Award.

04:03.944 --> 04:04.810
(doorbell rings)

04:05.945 --> 04:07.813
Wassup, dude?

04:09.716 --> 04:12.184
Lester? What are
you doing here?

04:12.186 --> 04:12.851
Just begging door-to-door.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.519
What are you doing here?

04:14.521 --> 04:16.021
This is my parents' house.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.222
I'm house-sitting.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.056
Well, can I come in?

04:18.058 --> 04:21.059
No. My parents
said no friends.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.262
Okay, then can
I have a dollar?

04:23.264 --> 04:25.264
(sighs)
Just come in.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.531
I'll get you a
glass of tap water,

04:26.533 --> 04:28.200
and then you're
on your way.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.402
God bless you.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.804
(doorbell rings)

04:34.540 --> 04:36.875
What are you guys doing here?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.244
Lester just texted us
you were giving
out free waters.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.245
Lester, I told you

04:40.247 --> 04:42.781
my dad said no
friends in the house.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.783
I'd let it slide, but...

04:44.785 --> 04:47.552
the neighbors are
such snitches.

04:47.554 --> 04:48.954
Oh, hey, Mrs. Hickerson!

04:48.956 --> 04:52.224
Those better not be friends,
Cleveland!

04:52.226 --> 04:52.958
Of course not!

04:52.960 --> 04:55.460
They're lowly
gardeners.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.663
Come around back,
you dirtbags.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.231
(whispers):
J.K.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.567
(groans)

05:02.569 --> 05:04.903
Damn wig is itchier
than the lice.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.072
I don't know how
Nathan Fillion
probably does it.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.976
You wearing a wig?
What?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.477
(sniffs)

05:12.479 --> 05:13.779
Your hair smells like
street ball and weed.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.515
It's Herbal Essence.
(laughs)

05:16.517 --> 05:18.517
Covered with a joke.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.651
So, how 'bout girls?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.019
(grunts)

05:21.021 --> 05:22.087
(kids gasp)

05:22.089 --> 05:23.188
Rallo has a...

05:23.190 --> 05:25.857
peanut head!

05:25.859 --> 05:27.292
Your nickname is...

05:27.294 --> 05:28.260
Mr. Peanut!

05:28.262 --> 05:30.062
(laughter)

05:30.530 --> 05:32.597
Mr. Peanut!

05:32.599 --> 05:34.032
(laughs)

05:42.375 --> 05:43.875
(door opens)

05:43.877 --> 05:45.877
I can't ever go back
to school, Mama.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.280
Those kids
are emotional terrorists.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.482
They called me Mr. Peanut!

05:50.484 --> 05:52.451
All the Tubbs
got the peanut head.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.353
Calm down, honey.

05:54.355 --> 05:57.289
Like I was just yelling
at Gwyneth Paltrow on TV,

05:57.291 --> 05:59.891
you're not the center
of the universe.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.461
Now go on; I got
my own problems.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.796
(school bell rings)

06:06.999 --> 06:08.800
Nice hat, Rallo.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.702
Mighty kind of you, ma'am.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.705
Yeah, that <i>is</i>
<i>a nice hat.</i>

06:13.707 --> 06:15.941
So nice that
I want it!

06:21.047 --> 06:22.314
Peanuts!

06:22.316 --> 06:23.348
Mr. Peanut's here!

06:23.350 --> 06:26.818
(laughter)

06:26.820 --> 06:28.553
Aw, I'm just
messing around.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.155
I'll give you a hat.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.890
Thanks, man. Sharp.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.525
And try this.
It'll look cool.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.061
Oh, well, okay.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.330
Nothing wrong with
classing things up.

06:38.332 --> 06:39.765
BOY:
Here, catch!
Huh.

06:39.767 --> 06:43.935
This will help with walking
or the occasional tap dance.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.572
Hey, everybody,
it's Mr. Peanut!

06:47.574 --> 06:47.973
(laughter)

06:52.879 --> 06:54.780
Can we go
in the tree house?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.082
CLEVELAND: Nah. It's just
for Dad and his buddies.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.418
I heard there's
a treasure map in there.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.186
I've got something
even better.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.955
What's that?
Nothing.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.359
Just a cigarillo I stole
from my father 25 years ago.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.761
(all gasp)

07:09.763 --> 07:11.396
(Simple Minds' "Don't You"
playing)

07:11.398 --> 07:13.064
Dads suck.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.700
"Pass the Dutchie." '80s.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.437
(inhales, exhales)
"Didn't inhale." '90s.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.605
Nobody cares what I say.
Least of all, my dad.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.374
(inhales)

07:22.376 --> 07:25.410
My dad made me get out
of the river to poop.

07:25.412 --> 07:29.080
(coughing)

07:29.082 --> 07:31.483
I was gonna be
the only hetra-male

07:31.485 --> 07:33.952
at the American Bal-let School
for Dancing Pansies,

07:33.954 --> 07:35.654
but Pappy said no.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.389
And I was good.

07:37.391 --> 07:38.623
Billy Elliot good.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.227
(inhales)

07:42.229 --> 07:45.096
We should come up
with a name for ourselves.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.798
How about Lester's Crew?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.167
Love it! Sold! Moving on!

07:49.169 --> 07:51.903
I have become a shell
of my former self.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.139
A peanut shell.
(chuckles)

07:54.141 --> 07:56.441
That'd be good if it was
for someone else.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.644
CLEVELAND JR.:

07:59.646 --> 08:02.681
♪Haven't a care,

08:02.683 --> 08:05.484

Junior Birdman ♪

08:05.486 --> 08:07.085
Oh. Hey-ya, Rallo.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.185
What song are
you singing?

08:08.187 --> 08:10.188
Just one I made up.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.090
It's called "The Ballad
of the Terrible Triumph

08:12.092 --> 08:13.992
of Thomas J. Cutekitten."

08:13.994 --> 08:16.294
Parentheses, "Junior Birdman."

08:16.296 --> 08:17.128
How do you do it, Junior?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.764
Well, the hardest part
is getting

08:19.766 --> 08:23.435
these sausage fingers of mine
to bend into birdman goggles.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.970
No, man. I'm talking about
doesn't it bother you

08:24.972 --> 08:27.506
that you get teased
all the time?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.374
I just don't pay
much attention,

08:29.376 --> 08:32.978
because I can always
get lost in my imagination.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.780
Come, let me show you <i>my</i> world.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.184
First, you need
to get a best buddy,

08:39.186 --> 08:40.986
like Larry the Leopard here.

08:40.988 --> 08:44.356
Uh, I don't really play
with dolls, man.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.457
(chuckles)

08:45.459 --> 08:49.027
To the naked eye, they
may seem like dolls,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.997
but they're an eclectic
crew of personalities.

08:51.999 --> 08:55.200
Like you'd find on an NBC
sitcom no one would watch.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.168
This is Roy.
He's a zebra.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.504
He's five years
old-- like you--

08:59.506 --> 09:01.139
and he has
anxiety-induced eczema.

09:01.141 --> 09:05.076
He turns black and
white and red all over.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.478
(laughs): Black and
white and red all...

09:06.480 --> 09:07.579
That's Larry's.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.980
I can't take
credit for that.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.516
(laughs):
Yee-haw!

09:11.518 --> 09:15.220
Hey, Rallo, feel that wind
on your face as we ride?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.223
No, Junior, I feel
boring on my face.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.226
Come on, Rallo.
Use your imagination.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.895
Look! A battle cruiser
is approaching!

09:23.897 --> 09:26.164
Oh, okay,
what do I do?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.067
Hyah! Go, Roy!
Nerd it up!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.436
I don't know, man.
I still don't see it.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.004
Do not see.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.240
Simply be.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.709
The intergalactic battle
enters its fourth millennium.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.979
What the frak?!

09:44.050 --> 09:46.918
Whoa! They bangin'
up here in space!

09:59.465 --> 10:00.599
We're screwed!

10:00.601 --> 10:02.033
We don't have
any weapons!

10:02.035 --> 10:04.636
We <i>are</i> weapons.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.282
(gasps, grunting)

10:18.818 --> 10:22.887
Leeroy Jenkins!

10:23.789 --> 10:26.658
(engine powers down)

10:27.627 --> 10:29.461
Yee-hoo!

10:29.463 --> 10:30.562
We did it!

10:30.564 --> 10:32.330
We won space!

10:32.332 --> 10:33.665
Yay!

10:33.667 --> 10:36.301
(both laugh)

10:36.303 --> 10:38.436
That was the most
funnest thing ever!

10:38.438 --> 10:39.237
Thanks, Junior.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.306
You really
made my week.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.109
I almost forgot
I'm a bald weirdo.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.176
Like Nathan Fillion,
probably.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.448
Man, if my right arm
wasn't so short,

10:50.450 --> 10:52.117
I could've played
for the Yankees.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.119
Nobody in this
town gets us.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.119
I wish I had a boat.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.489
I am not a ninny.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.257
You're a ninny, Father.

10:59.259 --> 10:59.624
Hi-yah!

10:59.626 --> 11:01.593
(shouts)

11:01.595 --> 11:02.193
And...

11:02.195 --> 11:04.195
(shouting gibberish)

11:06.666 --> 11:07.932
Lester, what the hell?!

11:07.934 --> 11:11.302
That's my dad's RCee Cola!

11:11.304 --> 11:13.171
His most favorite thing
in the world!

11:13.173 --> 11:15.807
(gasping)

11:15.809 --> 11:17.342
Relax, Cleveland,
don't spaz out.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.377
We'll just get some more
at the store.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.012
Good thinking.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.147
That's why we're
Lester's Gang.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.949
Uh, I thought we
were Lester's Crew.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.951
Why would you say that?

11:26.953 --> 11:28.620
You knew what I meant.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.222
We were best friends,
but now I hate you forever.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.626
Hi, June.

11:34.628 --> 11:35.860
Looking right at your eyes.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.696
Where do you keep
the RCee Cola?

11:37.698 --> 11:40.365
RCee Cola?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.467
(laughs)
Oh, sweetie,
we haven't carried

11:42.469 --> 11:45.170
RCee Cola since forever.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.138
No place in Stoolbend has.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.374
In fact, I don't think
you can get it

11:49.376 --> 11:50.809
anywhere in Virginia.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.144
None in Virginia?!

11:53.146 --> 11:54.479
But if I don't
replace those RCees,

11:54.481 --> 11:55.413
my father will kill me--

11:55.415 --> 11:57.682
I looked at your breasts,
I'm sorry.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.718
If you really need them,

11:59.720 --> 12:02.187
there's a place in Kentucky
that might have...

12:02.189 --> 12:03.988
Where?! Tell me!

12:03.990 --> 12:06.424
For God's sakes, tell me!

12:06.426 --> 12:09.194
You don't have to shake me;
I'll tell you.

12:09.196 --> 12:09.894
That's not why
I'm shaking you--

12:09.896 --> 12:12.497
thank you, sorry!

12:12.499 --> 12:15.066
The store's in
Horsepile, Kentucky,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.402
about ten hours
from here.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.938
Look out, Horsepile,
because here comes

12:19.940 --> 12:21.172
Lester's Boys!

12:21.174 --> 12:22.273
Crew.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.441
I hate you.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.542
I love you.

12:24.544 --> 12:24.909
Ah, come on!

12:24.911 --> 12:26.678
(laughs)

12:26.680 --> 12:30.582
(both laugh)

12:30.584 --> 12:31.716
That was so cool when
we outran Emperor Blog

12:31.718 --> 12:34.385
and he was like,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.688
"Puny humans, come back
with my Blakelivelium!"

12:36.690 --> 12:38.022
(chuckles)

12:38.024 --> 12:40.625
Yeah, and when you destroyed

12:40.627 --> 12:43.428
his Bio-Organic Interceptor,
he was like,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.230
(deep voice): "I will feast
on your still-beating heart."

12:45.232 --> 12:48.032
Man, I got to work
on my voices.

12:49.802 --> 12:52.370
You know, Junior,
I'm actually gonna miss this

12:52.372 --> 12:54.038
when my hair grows back.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.206
Me, too.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.478
(snoring)

13:06.051 --> 13:09.721
Stay bald, my brother.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.856
Stay bald.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.498
Congratulations!

13:20.500 --> 13:21.966
That's five in a row
you've won!

13:21.968 --> 13:23.735
Want to play again?

13:23.737 --> 13:26.371
Eh, nah, I'm kind of
bored with this game.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.808
What's the matter,
don't you like

13:29.810 --> 13:32.644
playing Elves, Goblins
and Orcs Who Choke You?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.512
<i>This</i> is what's the matter.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.980
You think my hair
will ever grow back?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.016
It will grow back.

13:38.018 --> 13:38.783
In your imagination.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.852
Come on!

13:40.854 --> 13:42.487
Nah, you imagine without me.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.387
I'm not feeling it.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.757
Oh, I almost forgot.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.025
When you win five games,

13:47.027 --> 13:49.160
I take you out
for ice cream.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.296
Really? Well, I guess
even a bald man

13:51.298 --> 13:53.198
can enjoy ice cream.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.100
Let me call Nathan
Fillion and ask him.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.699

15:01.568 --> 15:04.602
is opening his
new restaurant this weekend.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.238
I got us the last
reservation they had.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.375
Okay. They cook everything
in some copper
pot or something?

15:10.377 --> 15:11.542
A cauldron, yes!

15:11.544 --> 15:14.345
And it's all
stringy rabbit meat.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.114
Hey, Rallo, what's up?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.682
For my birthday party
this weekend,

15:17.684 --> 15:18.917
we're going go-karting.

15:18.919 --> 15:22.387
Really? Ah, I've always
wanted to go go-karting.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.554
Not me.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.890
<i>Way</i> too fat.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.592
You should come, Rallo.
(snaps fingers)

15:27.594 --> 15:29.527
Except you can't ride
in the car with us

15:29.529 --> 15:31.429
because my mom's
allergic to peanuts.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.597
(laughter)

15:34.800 --> 15:36.467
(laughter continues)

15:42.408 --> 15:44.742
Damn, damn, damn!

15:44.744 --> 15:46.377
I'm never gonna
find the RCees,

15:46.379 --> 15:47.779
and Dad'll hate
me forever.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.548
I might as well kill
myself and all my friends

15:50.550 --> 15:53.051
by driving into
this roadside store!

15:53.053 --> 15:54.118
The store.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.421
We're here! Totes perf!

15:56.423 --> 15:57.422
(tires screech)

15:57.424 --> 16:00.525
The RCees--
where are they?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.464
(angelic choir sings)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.132
Well, we're not buying these.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.233
The lids are filthy.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.902
Cleveland!
Okay, okay.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.236
We can wash them later.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.406
Doctor.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.516
No. I can't.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.752
(deep voice):
Cut his throat!

16:27.754 --> 16:29.687
(normal voice): No! He still
has a chance
in the real world.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.922
(deep voice):
So do you.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.090
(normal voice):
Really?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.558
(deep voice):
What do you want
me to say, man?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.766
RALLO:
Junior!

16:41.768 --> 16:42.934
It's a miracle!

16:42.936 --> 16:44.469
My hair's growing in!

16:44.471 --> 16:48.206
Oh, feel my fuzz.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.807
I got stubble!

16:49.809 --> 16:51.642
I don't look like
a peanut anymore.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.810
Congratulations.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.645
No more peanut.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.615
Now maybe I can go-kart
with the guys on Saturday.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.651
But that's the day
we were gonna go

17:00.653 --> 17:02.220
to the wizard restaurant,
isn't it?

17:02.222 --> 17:04.188
That's okay.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.357
There'll be other
17th century medieval-themed

17:06.359 --> 17:08.459
rabbit meat restaurants
where you can eat with horses

17:08.461 --> 17:08.860
opening in Stoolbend.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.695
You sure?

17:11.497 --> 17:12.697
Thanks, Junior.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.668
DONNA: Where the hell
is my Schick Hydro at?!

17:17.670 --> 17:19.737
I'm getting cactus legs
up in here!

17:27.980 --> 17:29.881
Hurry up, they'll be here
any minute.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.517
Last one.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.718
LAVAR:
Tubby, we're home.

17:34.987 --> 17:35.853
Friends over?

17:35.855 --> 17:37.755
I knew I couldn't
trust you.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.157
Say, what you hiding

17:39.159 --> 17:40.691
behind your back?
Nothing.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.126
Cleveland, don't lie
to your father.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.064
An RCee Cola?!

17:46.066 --> 17:47.432
Your papa's pop?!

17:47.434 --> 17:49.067
I told you
never to touch those!

17:49.069 --> 17:49.667
Now you gonna get it!

17:49.669 --> 17:52.036
Just wait one second.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.272
Before you beat me
and make me cry

17:54.274 --> 17:57.708
in front of my besties,
I got something to tell you,

17:57.710 --> 18:00.244
and you're gonna listen,
old man.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.979
You're a bad father!

18:03.449 --> 18:05.750
What the hell
you doing, boy?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.186
What I should've done
a long time ago.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.287
(gasps)

18:11.090 --> 18:12.924
(gasps)
Cleveland, no!

18:14.226 --> 18:16.360
(sighs):
Ah!

18:16.362 --> 18:19.263
Wow, that's (burps) good!

18:19.265 --> 18:20.531
(laughs):
Oh!

18:20.533 --> 18:23.634
I think I love this soda
more than my own son!

18:25.571 --> 18:28.306
This is what I think
of your rules.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.576
Thank you.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.045
We've got each other's
back door.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.047
So, you're all willing
to take the blame for this?

18:36.049 --> 18:39.283
Good, 'cause I got
a little surprise for y'all.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.585
(whistles)

18:40.587 --> 18:43.221
General Richter!
Papa Bear!

18:43.223 --> 18:44.822
Sir!
My brother-pa!

18:44.824 --> 18:46.557
How did you know
they were in on it?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.259
Mrs. Hickerson ratted you out.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.961
Mrs. Hickerson.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.063
Get laid, you hag.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.799
Now, fellas, let's do this.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.403
(whimpers)

18:59.405 --> 19:00.838
Here.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.807
You finally stood up to me.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.976
It's time for me
to pass it on.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.011
Now you take it and
beat your own son.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.179
Oh, my God.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.114
I-I don't know what to say.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.083
Come here, boy.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.084
Wham! Wham! Wham!

19:13.086 --> 19:15.586
(laughs)

19:15.588 --> 19:16.821
Nah, they'd lock me up.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.955
Here, son.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.123
This is for you.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.625
Your Rolex
with the jubilee bracelet

19:20.627 --> 19:23.327
that a faceless client
gave you?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.428
I know, it's
ostentatious.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.197
And now it's yours.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.501
Your bow tie?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.170
Does this mean
you'll stop banging Arianna?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.371
No.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.840
Your favorite lint.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.742
(speaks gibberish)

19:42.948 --> 19:44.215
To finish this bonding,
what say we all
go have an RCee

19:44.217 --> 19:46.284
up in the tree fort?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.286
(cheering)

19:48.288 --> 19:50.354
(honks)

19:51.390 --> 19:52.957
Wait, Rallo!

19:52.959 --> 19:54.192
Don't forget your helmet.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.293
What?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.394
Oh, right.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.795
Safety first.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.296
Thanks, Junior.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.865
I almost forgot.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.466
Would you mind
looking after Roy for me?

20:02.468 --> 20:04.969
You got his
eczema cream?

20:04.971 --> 20:05.903
Right here.

20:06.972 --> 20:07.771
Thanks.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.039
Okay, bye, Junior.

20:11.176 --> 20:14.345
Good-bye, Rallo.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.914
Your 'fro's looking
good, Rallo.

20:16.916 --> 20:17.814
Rockin' the Barack.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.383
Thanks, Dudley.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.819
(gasps)
You called me Dudley.

20:21.821 --> 20:22.887
Yeah. I'm using my imagination

20:22.889 --> 20:26.190
not to see boogers
all over your face.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.059
(laughs)

20:30.329 --> 20:32.096
What's that, Roy?

20:32.098 --> 20:33.030
General Hakimi has kidnapped
the princess

20:33.032 --> 20:35.700
of the People's Republic
of Galaxy?

20:35.702 --> 20:38.169
Time to go kick
some space ass.

20:38.171 --> 20:41.138
Hi-yah!

20:43.508 --> 20:47.511
Go get 'em, you lunatic.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.280
(lasers firing, explosions)
