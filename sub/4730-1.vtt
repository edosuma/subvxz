00:55.895 --> 00:58.448
"Girl, I love..." No.

00:58.775 --> 01:00.302
"Girl, I love your..."

01:00.374 --> 01:02.065
No, that ain't it.

01:02.358 --> 01:04.269
"Girl, I love your style.

01:04.535 --> 01:06.771
"I love when you get that smile.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.967
"You should be in a magazine,
because you're a queen.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.622
"Our love is everything."

01:14.198 --> 01:16.751
- Percy?
- Not right now. I'm busy.

01:17.205 --> 01:19.094
You got a girl in there?

01:22.453 --> 01:24.908
What kind of question is that,
"You got a woman in here?"

01:24.981 --> 01:26.606
I didn't know. I heard you talking.

01:26.677 --> 01:28.652
- I'm in here doing my vows.
- Vows?

01:28.724 --> 01:32.302
For this ridiculous party
my wife is losing her mind over!

01:32.437 --> 01:36.877
This extravaganza is costing a lot of money.
Now she wants us to renew our vows.

01:37.172 --> 01:39.180
What was wrong with what I said
the first time?

01:39.253 --> 01:41.773
- What's wrong with "I do"? I did, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

01:41.843 --> 01:45.323
- Women, boy.
- I know. Women, it's just a whole other...

01:48.788 --> 01:52.944
You know what? I think it's cool
you're just doing the lyrics from that song.

01:53.011 --> 01:54.899
I wrote this on the way to work
this morning.

01:54.963 --> 01:56.720
- You wrote that on the way to work?
- Yeah.

01:56.787 --> 02:00.365
Were you listening to the radio
when you wrote it? 'Cause I think it's B2K.

02:00.434 --> 02:03.818
Okay, then. If this is to a song,
tell me what the next line is.

02:05.107 --> 02:06.829
Baby, turn around

02:06.962 --> 02:10.475
And let me see that sexy body
go bump, bump, bump

02:10.930 --> 02:12.206
That's it.

02:14.514 --> 02:15.462
Go.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.627
Reggie.

02:20.786 --> 02:23.054
See your sexy smile and bump, bump?

02:23.217 --> 02:25.160
- Three bumps.
- Three bumps.

02:27.858 --> 02:30.475
See your sexy smile and you bump, bump

02:31.153 --> 02:33.575
See your sexy smile and you

02:40.273 --> 02:44.265
Hey, boss. Did I hear Theresa's bringing
a new boyfriend to your anniversary party?

02:44.336 --> 02:45.350
Yes.

02:46.287 --> 02:48.230
What? I'm fine with it.

02:48.432 --> 02:51.629
- So, you met him?
- Nope. I pulled his credit report.

02:51.952 --> 02:54.537
- You didn't.
- I sure as hell did.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.835
Fred, this young brother is a stockbroker
for J.P. Oliver.

02:59.022 --> 03:02.253
- Theresa? I don't believe it.
- Marilyn said she's crazy about him.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.726
And this boy's credit report, I'm telling you,
is a thing of beauty.

03:06.798 --> 03:08.227
I almost cried.

03:08.302 --> 03:10.952
Wow, this guy sounds too good to be true.

03:11.021 --> 03:14.185
He probably is. But the brother has a job.

03:14.254 --> 03:17.287
- I'm glad you think that way...
- That's right, my friend. A J-O-B!

03:17.357 --> 03:18.787
...but I quit.

03:20.461 --> 03:23.178
- I quit!
- Simon, calm down.

03:23.597 --> 03:26.696
I'm just trying to explain to you
how the world works.

03:26.765 --> 03:28.707
It's the clients, I'm just explaining...

03:28.781 --> 03:31.945
None of my clients seem to care.
This guy didn't seem to care, did he?

03:32.013 --> 03:33.736
Come on. Don't be so sensitive.

03:33.803 --> 03:36.903
That's not how the world works.
It's how your world works.

03:37.422 --> 03:39.843
Simon, sit down. Simon!

03:50.572 --> 03:51.587
Jerk.

03:52.619 --> 03:54.408
I don't need you, Nathan!

03:54.475 --> 03:56.231
I don't need J.P. Oliver.

03:56.746 --> 04:00.640
My résumé is good enough. I can get a job
anywhere I want. I'm out of here.

04:09.066 --> 04:11.487
I'm not going to freak out!

04:12.874 --> 04:14.335
What am I going to tell Theresa?

04:14.409 --> 04:15.872
What am I going to tell her?

04:15.945 --> 04:20.615
"Baby, you know how you're always
saying I'm at the office too much?

04:20.682 --> 04:21.793
"Well, great news!"

04:21.865 --> 04:25.543
I'll meet my future father-in-law and
tell him I'm unemployed. That'll be great.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.326
Okay. I'll get the next one.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.083
I can't quit my job!

04:32.520 --> 04:33.765
I'm not gonna beg for this job!

04:33.833 --> 04:36.550
- I got $20 says he goes up again.
- I'll take some of that.

04:36.617 --> 04:38.853
Oh, my God! I just quit my job!

04:39.240 --> 04:41.344
I don't need this job! No.

04:52.135 --> 04:53.564
Here he comes.

04:57.446 --> 05:00.000
- Hi.
- Have a good one.

05:00.071 --> 05:03.901
Hello, Liz. Simon Green here.

05:04.743 --> 05:06.052
Simon! What's up?

05:06.119 --> 05:08.572
Every investment I've made
in the last six months.

05:09.382 --> 05:13.244
Listen. That job you offered me.
Tell me it's still open.

05:13.318 --> 05:14.528
Why? What happened?

05:14.597 --> 05:17.315
I'll tell you about it later.
Can you talk to Bartlett for me?

05:17.382 --> 05:19.618
Are you kidding?
I'm e-mailing him right now.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.409
When he finds out you asked about this...

05:23.013 --> 05:23.995
he will go nuts!

05:24.069 --> 05:25.728
Liz, thank you.

06:09.154 --> 06:10.976
Theresa? Baby?

06:13.442 --> 06:15.035
You're home early.

06:15.554 --> 06:17.245
Really early. Hi.

06:17.313 --> 06:20.379
- Got out of there quick.
- Good. Then come on, help me with these.

06:21.184 --> 06:22.526
What have we got?

06:23.969 --> 06:25.016
Tumi.

06:25.665 --> 06:29.308
- That's nice. When did we get this?
- Got them today.

06:30.593 --> 06:34.007
Combined incomes. Bling bling, baby!

06:34.112 --> 06:35.772
Yeah. Bling bling.

06:40.351 --> 06:41.367
Baby?

06:41.632 --> 06:44.120
God. You should have heard Dad's voice
on the phone...

06:44.191 --> 06:46.526
when I told him you work for J.P. Oliver.

06:46.593 --> 06:49.626
I feel like he's more in love with you
than I am.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.446
- Really?
- Yeah. You don't understand.

06:52.799 --> 06:55.798
Ever since I can remember,
his whole thing has been about:

06:55.870 --> 06:58.041
"Theresa, does that boy have a job?"

07:00.384 --> 07:03.100
- It's a good thing I do then, huh?
- I know.

07:04.637 --> 07:07.736
I'm so excited! Aren't you excited?

07:08.510 --> 07:13.115
Theresa, a man is never excited
about meeting his future father-in-law.

07:14.909 --> 07:18.706
You know, I was thinking.
Maybe we should postpone telling them.

07:19.581 --> 07:20.596
What?

07:20.669 --> 07:22.709
- It was your idea.
- I know.

07:23.517 --> 07:25.972
But I'm thinking now
that maybe it was a bad idea.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.833
No, I think it's a great idea.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.268
Announcing our engagement
at my parents' party...

07:30.333 --> 07:33.202
is gonna be the best present
we can give them.

07:33.277 --> 07:35.100
Babe, Mom's gonna flip.

07:35.453 --> 07:39.096
See, I'm not worried about your mom.
I was thinking about...

07:40.541 --> 07:41.750
him.

07:43.387 --> 07:47.250
See, he's about ready
to pop a blood vessel...

07:47.676 --> 07:50.611
in his head, because you guys
are losing a basketball game.

07:50.683 --> 07:53.979
No, we were winning that game. Yeah.

08:00.059 --> 08:02.198
We're bringing in a canopy here.

08:02.267 --> 08:05.202
Swags of tulle with festoons.

08:05.275 --> 08:06.998
Sprays of roses.

08:07.323 --> 08:09.558
Parquet dance floor here.

08:09.625 --> 08:12.211
Guests will be seated at tables
in Chiavari chairs.

08:12.282 --> 08:14.223
Very clean, very simple, very elegant.

08:14.298 --> 08:17.364
And rose petals on the lawn.
And not just a few...

08:17.753 --> 08:18.768
oodles.

08:18.842 --> 08:22.224
At my wedding, we had oodles of petals.
It was fabulous.

08:22.394 --> 08:24.913
At that wedding, was a woman involved?

08:25.528 --> 08:27.055
Of course it involved a woman.

08:27.129 --> 08:30.577
If she's not a woman, it's gonna be
a surprise to both of us. Hello!

08:30.648 --> 08:33.943
- Look.
- I'll tell you, this is going to be some party.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.275
Twenty-five years of marriage.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.504
- More power to you, pal.
- Thank you.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.903
- Hey, baby.
- Sorry I'm late.

08:42.294 --> 08:44.400
My vice principal called in sick today...

08:44.471 --> 08:47.406
so it was just me
against 208 middle-schoolers.

08:47.545 --> 08:50.610
I swear half of them
ate pure sugar for breakfast.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.690
Hi, Dante.

08:52.758 --> 08:56.053
- So, Percy, which one do you like best?
- I like that...

08:56.119 --> 08:57.776
Is your name Percy?

08:58.455 --> 08:59.438
Which one costs the most?

08:59.512 --> 09:01.486
- They cost the same.
- They don't cost the same.

09:01.559 --> 09:03.566
This one's from Saks.
This one's from Macy's.

09:03.638 --> 09:04.686
Saks!

09:05.526 --> 09:08.493
Thank you.
And now I can give my honest opinion.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.971
- I'm digging that one, baby.
- Really?

09:14.486 --> 09:17.236
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I'm wearing this one.

09:17.303 --> 09:18.611
Hallelujah.

09:20.534 --> 09:21.811
Sweetheart.

09:21.973 --> 09:23.403
- Yeah?
- Listen.

09:24.149 --> 09:25.971
Why do you even bother asking me?

09:26.037 --> 09:28.853
'Cause it's a big day for us
and I wanted you to feel included.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.535
Why couldn't you include
Martha Superfreak out there?

09:31.606 --> 09:33.197
Dante is a nice man.

09:33.685 --> 09:34.994
A nice man.

09:35.060 --> 09:38.126
A nice man that part of the time
likes to sleep with other nice men.

09:38.196 --> 09:39.341
Will you stop it?

09:39.412 --> 09:42.576
Would you open your mind, Percy Jones?
Dante is a metrosexual.

09:42.643 --> 09:44.619
- A what?
- He's a straight man with taste.

09:44.692 --> 09:47.987
No such thing. You might as well tell me
he rode over here on a unicorn.

09:48.052 --> 09:51.247
Look, serious face, serious moment.

09:51.699 --> 09:52.812
I need to talk to you.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.730
I know, baby. I'm working on my vows.
Almost got them perfect.

09:55.794 --> 09:58.611
- That's sweet, but that's not it.
- What is it?

09:59.540 --> 10:02.060
This boy that Theresa's bringing home?

10:02.482 --> 10:05.067
I don't know who his people are,
where he's from...

10:05.139 --> 10:07.374
I don't know anything about him.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.377
But what I do know is that
I need you to be nice.

10:10.898 --> 10:12.175
I'm always nice.

10:12.241 --> 10:15.024
Let's be nice long enough
to find out who the boy is.

10:15.090 --> 10:17.000
I already know who he is.

10:17.522 --> 10:19.561
- You pulled his credit report?
- I did not.

10:19.633 --> 10:22.055
You pulled his credit report, Percy?

10:23.794 --> 10:25.649
I mean, I glanced at it.

10:25.713 --> 10:28.528
But a credit report don't tell you
the character of a man.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.982
But being a loan officer for 22 years...

10:31.184 --> 10:33.073
I can size that boy up in an instant.

10:33.138 --> 10:35.691
And you know I got a knack for it.
You know that.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.865
Five seconds. That's all I need.

10:39.536 --> 10:41.063
That's all I need.

10:42.446 --> 10:45.263
- Nobody knows that better than me.
- Say what?

10:45.713 --> 10:47.087
I didn't stutter.

10:55.694 --> 10:57.933
I'm not so good with dads, baby.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.842
I'm good with moms. I'm better with moms.

11:00.976 --> 11:02.983
He's a big guy, right?

11:03.055 --> 11:05.257
Scary big. He also has these...

11:05.326 --> 11:07.692
piercing eyes that just burn
right into your soul.

11:07.757 --> 11:12.132
Don't maintain eye contact for
a long period of time. At least today, okay?

11:13.326 --> 11:16.904
Babe, I'm kidding.
Just relax. It's gonna be fun.

11:17.742 --> 11:18.822
Okay?

11:20.589 --> 11:23.273
- Did you tell them?
- What? Tell them what?

11:23.724 --> 11:26.571
- Babe, don't... The...
- What?

11:27.149 --> 11:29.092
- Did you... I'm...
- Cute? Clean-shaven? What?

11:29.165 --> 11:31.619
Pigment-challenged?
Did you tell them that I'm white?

11:31.693 --> 11:33.100
You're white?

11:33.549 --> 11:34.726
You're white?

11:35.085 --> 11:36.229
Stop the car!

11:37.741 --> 11:39.976
Oh, my God! Look at what you...

11:43.149 --> 11:44.425
Oh, my God.

11:44.653 --> 11:46.114
Simon, I'm so sorry.

11:46.412 --> 11:50.088
- It was a joke, sir. I was kidding.
- Yeah, sister. You're funny.

11:50.858 --> 11:52.550
Simon, are you okay?

11:53.482 --> 11:55.621
- Who are you?
- Are you serious?

11:56.042 --> 11:57.670
Why am I in Jersey?

12:03.082 --> 12:05.799
- Don't worry. It's gonna be great, okay?
- All right.

12:05.866 --> 12:08.517
I'm very sorry. It was a bad joke.

12:08.938 --> 12:13.161
- So, did you tell them?
- No. I only told them the important things.

12:14.539 --> 12:17.320
That I love you.
That you're an amazing man.

12:17.673 --> 12:20.805
That you have a very cute birthmark
on your left butt cheek.

12:20.938 --> 12:25.443
You just didn't feel the need to mention
it's a Caucasian butt cheek. That was...

12:26.376 --> 12:30.533
Simon, look. I didn't mention it
because I don't think it's gonna matter.

12:30.601 --> 12:33.187
It's gonna matter.

12:33.993 --> 12:35.520
We're fine, sir.

12:59.048 --> 13:00.062
Dad!

13:00.391 --> 13:03.739
Look at this here. Oh, my God.
Give your daddy a hug.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.168
How are you?

13:07.366 --> 13:08.381
Mom!

13:09.863 --> 13:13.540
- Hey, my man. Percy Jones, baby.
- Pleasure to meet you.

13:13.606 --> 13:18.013
Man, look at this here. I like this, man.
Nice, solid, strong grip.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.476
Wow. That's something else.

13:20.614 --> 13:23.962
Listen. You doing everything you can
to make my daughter happy?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.305
- No, Dad, it's...
- Hey, sweetheart.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.228
You can take that to the front door for me.

13:28.293 --> 13:29.722
- Thank you.
- No, you see, this...

13:29.797 --> 13:32.797
Don't interrupt.
I'm giving your friend a once-over here.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.697
Sir? Don't stand like a statue.
Take it to the front door.

13:36.773 --> 13:39.706
That's that square with the hole.
Look inside, you see furniture.

13:39.779 --> 13:41.055
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.492
You doing everything in your power
to make her happy?

13:43.557 --> 13:46.752
I'm not sure if I am,
but I'd sure like a crack at it.

13:46.820 --> 13:50.080
- Boy, I ought to drill you, man. I like him.
- Okay, all right, listen.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.051
Young man, don't worry about it. Relax.

13:53.122 --> 13:56.123
I figure, what, $30?
Get yourself some candy or something.

13:56.194 --> 13:57.820
Dad, this is Simon.

14:00.003 --> 14:01.083
Simon?

14:02.435 --> 14:05.216
- That's her boyfriend's name.
- That's right.

14:06.017 --> 14:08.473
- Well, who are you?
- Wesley Thompson. That's my cab.

14:08.546 --> 14:11.842
But if you're still down with me
making your girl happy...

14:11.908 --> 14:13.335
I'm good to go.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.190
- Why don't you just go?
- Just...

14:24.928 --> 14:28.225
I wish Theresa would have told me
you guys were black.

14:28.289 --> 14:30.907
That would have saved an awkward moment.

14:31.842 --> 14:34.591
- Kind of like this one.
- Yeah.

14:37.248 --> 14:39.582
- Welcome home, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

14:39.647 --> 14:41.403
- Baby, let me get that.
- I got it.

14:42.209 --> 14:43.419
Lemonade.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.807
Damn!

14:52.511 --> 14:56.571
Ain't no need, us standing out here.
Why don't we go on inside and talk?

14:56.639 --> 15:00.469
Come on, we going on inside
with a quickness. No use standing out here.

15:00.544 --> 15:01.972
Just come on.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.349
That boy's white.

15:03.775 --> 15:05.116
Nothing gets past you.

15:05.565 --> 15:08.500
I guess it's those 22 years as a loan officer.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.325
- You knew about this.
- I didn't know a thing, I promise you.

15:11.391 --> 15:14.424
But I did figure it out
after the second "Daddy!"

15:14.909 --> 15:17.723
Why she just didn't say nothing?
Give us a warning, you know?

15:17.789 --> 15:20.789
We taught our girls
to see only people, not color.

15:20.862 --> 15:23.578
- I know that but...
- So, what's the problem?

15:24.380 --> 15:26.868
I guess the problem is
she just didn't tell us.

15:26.941 --> 15:29.940
I'm expecting Denzel Washington
to come walking through the door...

15:30.013 --> 15:31.769
and I get Whitey McWhiteman instead.

15:31.837 --> 15:34.106
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi!

15:34.589 --> 15:36.628
I'm just showing Simon the house.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.488
You've a very beautiful home, Mrs. Jones.

15:38.556 --> 15:41.687
- Why, thank you. You can call me Marilyn.
- Will do.

15:41.756 --> 15:43.480
You, too, Mr. Jones.

15:43.549 --> 15:46.035
Thank you. You can call me Mr. Jones.

15:48.635 --> 15:50.196
I'm just kidding.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.553
You got me. That was funny.

15:53.722 --> 15:56.026
I'm making lemonade.
You want to sit down?

15:56.091 --> 15:59.156
- Yes, thank you. Sit down, babe.
- Great.

15:59.515 --> 16:02.198
So, Simon, they tell me
you work at J.P. Oliver?

16:02.266 --> 16:03.411
Yes, sir.

16:03.482 --> 16:07.443
- You like it there? You been there long?
- Well, it's a couple of years, I suppose.

16:07.514 --> 16:11.638
- You moving up?
- There's been some recent movement, yes.

16:12.154 --> 16:14.259
- You a hard worker? You work hard?
- The hardest.

16:14.330 --> 16:17.776
- J.P. Oliver has a huge IPO coming up...
- He doesn't want to hear about this.

16:17.849 --> 16:19.989
But he's asking you about your work.

16:20.058 --> 16:23.472
- I know, but you go into details...
- He likes to be modest. Shut up.

16:23.544 --> 16:27.506
Anyway, they made Simon their IPO...
Wait, what is it? Point man?

16:27.577 --> 16:29.999
And they're flying him
to San Francisco on Monday.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.309
I'm not going to see him for three days.

16:32.378 --> 16:34.765
- So, Simon, what do your parents do?
- Yeah.

16:34.839 --> 16:37.294
- My mother is a realtor.
- Mom, let me help you with that.

16:37.367 --> 16:40.182
And she sells mini-blinds
and teaches dance.

16:40.569 --> 16:42.903
Damn. How many jobs your mama got?

16:43.257 --> 16:46.420
She's a single parent.
She's always been a hard worker.

16:46.488 --> 16:48.309
What happened to your father?

16:48.855 --> 16:52.749
He left when I was two
and I haven't seen much of him since.

16:53.174 --> 16:56.438
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It happens.

16:57.369 --> 16:59.058
You play any sports?

17:01.878 --> 17:04.528
I played some foosball in college.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.839
- That's the table with the soccer guys...
- I know what foosball is.

17:09.910 --> 17:11.852
- Stupid joke.
- It's not a sport.

17:11.925 --> 17:13.648
Dad, stop badgering him.

17:13.718 --> 17:16.684
I'm not badgering him.
I'm just taking an interest.

17:16.758 --> 17:19.627
I don't understand why you don't
play sports? It don't make sense.

17:19.701 --> 17:22.830
A man who don't play sports
isn't a real man, as far as I'm concerned.

17:22.901 --> 17:25.234
- I used to run a little.
- What? Like track?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.792
I mean, you don't look like a sprinter.

17:31.862 --> 17:34.097
- What'd you run? Did you steeplechase?
- Dad!

17:34.164 --> 17:35.920
Come on, man. What was your race?

17:35.988 --> 17:37.875
- Cars.
- Cars.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.973
- NASCAR.
- NASCAR!

17:41.652 --> 17:43.213
That was the one.

17:44.148 --> 17:46.734
I had some hopes and some dreams and...

17:47.028 --> 17:50.705
it all ended on a hot August day
on a speedway in Charlotte.

17:51.316 --> 17:53.202
It was a crash. Just...

17:57.267 --> 17:58.991
They said I should've been killed.

17:59.059 --> 18:02.506
Actually, I got out without a scratch.
I figured that was a sign.

18:02.835 --> 18:03.979
NASCAR?

18:04.562 --> 18:06.221
Mostly I just worked in the pit.

18:06.290 --> 18:09.192
I mean, I test drove
for one of the drivers some, but...

18:09.266 --> 18:10.859
What was his name?

18:13.203 --> 18:14.608
Jay Gordon.

18:14.705 --> 18:16.648
You drove for Jeff Gordon?

18:17.009 --> 18:20.391
We called him Jay or J.G.
It was like a pet name.

18:21.842 --> 18:23.565
A pit name, actually.

18:24.338 --> 18:25.285
NASCAR?

18:26.290 --> 18:29.323
I believe I said I don't like to talk
about that time in my life.

18:29.394 --> 18:30.505
NASCAR?

18:31.505 --> 18:32.966
What was I supposed to do?

18:33.041 --> 18:35.855
He was staring at me
with those piercing eyes.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.447
- He was not.
- It was like...

18:37.519 --> 18:41.830
filled with piercing disappointment
'cause I don't play sports?

18:42.034 --> 18:45.131
"A man who don't play sports
isn't really a man now, is he?"

18:45.233 --> 18:48.199
I had to give him something! He's big.

18:48.463 --> 18:51.365
He's like... You said he was big,
but he's big-big.

18:51.439 --> 18:54.408
But why did you lie about NASCAR?
My father loves NASCAR.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.862
It's NASCAR, baby. That's, like,
the whitest sport on the planet.

18:57.934 --> 18:59.277
Not anymore, Simon.

18:59.343 --> 19:01.764
There's, like, NASCAR and hockey.

19:02.286 --> 19:04.228
Hockey. I should have went with hockey.

19:04.302 --> 19:08.327
Don't worry. He'll forget about it.
He's like this with everyone.

19:08.399 --> 19:11.497
It always takes him some time
to warm up to new people. That's all.

19:11.566 --> 19:15.656
- What are we talking about here?
- By Sunday, you'll be a part of this family.

19:16.142 --> 19:18.411
I can tell he really likes you.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.286
I don't like him.

19:23.021 --> 19:26.316
And I really don't think
the whole racial thing matters to him.

19:26.862 --> 19:29.414
- It's not that he's white.
- It's not?

19:40.621 --> 19:44.034
- Is this yours or mine?
- That's mine and that's for later.

19:44.107 --> 19:46.474
No. I think it's for now.

19:47.435 --> 19:50.664
- Lf memory serves me right, I think it's mine.
- No, Simon.

19:53.069 --> 19:54.409
Take it off!

19:54.956 --> 19:57.192
- Take it off right now.
- It's perfect on me.

19:57.259 --> 19:59.680
- What are you doing?
- Look at it. Red is my color.

19:59.755 --> 20:03.070
- Always has been. Look at it. My goodness!
- Simon, take it off.

20:03.146 --> 20:04.259
But it fits me so perfectly.

20:04.331 --> 20:05.475
Look, you're stretching it!

20:05.546 --> 20:07.204
- Take it off right now.
- It's not ruined.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.967
It's nice. You take it off.

20:09.035 --> 20:10.943
- I'm not joking.
- You want some of this?

20:11.018 --> 20:12.480
Stop it, Simon.

20:12.554 --> 20:14.561
- Take it off.
- You take it off.

20:14.634 --> 20:15.910
Coming in.

20:20.234 --> 20:21.247
Mom!

20:22.026 --> 20:24.928
- I'm going to tell her right now.
- Go and tell.

20:25.002 --> 20:27.751
- What?
- He's taking Simon to a hotel!

20:28.361 --> 20:29.954
I'm paying for it. What's the problem?

20:30.025 --> 20:31.399
- Can I speak to you?
- You sure can.

20:31.465 --> 20:32.872
Why are you taking him to a hotel?

20:32.937 --> 20:35.107
You didn't see
what they were about to do upstairs.

20:35.176 --> 20:38.045
- Mom, we were just playing.
- Well, playtime is over.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.803
Mr. Jones, I'm not a cross-dresser.

20:41.609 --> 20:42.819
Just for the record.

20:42.888 --> 20:44.863
- A cross-dresser?
- No.

20:45.127 --> 20:46.883
What are you... It's lingerie.

20:46.951 --> 20:50.115
- You shouldn't even be having any.
- I'm a grown woman, Percy!

20:50.183 --> 20:52.354
- It is not covering up the grown parts!
- What!

20:52.423 --> 20:54.333
Why does the young man
have to go to a hotel?

20:54.408 --> 20:56.643
Don't start with me.
This is my house and my rules.

20:56.711 --> 20:57.660
Your rules?

20:57.736 --> 20:59.590
This house can't handle
no more testosterone.

20:59.654 --> 21:01.564
We cannot exceed the testosterone level.

21:01.639 --> 21:05.284
We gotta keep it like that until the girls
get married. Maybe even beyond that.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.358
And I'm not suggesting anyone get married!

21:07.431 --> 21:09.470
Why can't he stay in the basement,
in your room?

21:09.542 --> 21:12.095
Because that's my room!
That's my stuff down there.

21:12.165 --> 21:13.857
- How selfish.
- That doesn't make sense.

21:13.926 --> 21:15.202
It got mold, anyway.

21:15.269 --> 21:18.368
Could be black mold. I wouldn't
feel comfortable putting him at risk.

21:18.437 --> 21:20.379
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

21:20.453 --> 21:21.467
No, it's okay.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.908
No, it's not okay!
What are you talking about?

21:23.974 --> 21:27.290
Look, this is your father's house.
We're gonna play it by his rules.

21:27.365 --> 21:30.431
Now, he's obviously set
a testosterone standard.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.874
And I'm going to abide by that.

21:31.941 --> 21:35.421
- You falling for that? I'm going with you.
- No, you're not gonna do that.

21:35.493 --> 21:38.592
- You don't want me to go with you?
- Of course I want you to!

21:38.661 --> 21:39.773
But what?

21:39.845 --> 21:41.339
- You need to stay here.
- Hello?

21:44.228 --> 21:45.242
You need to stay here.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.803
- No. I want to be with you!
- We're still here!

21:47.875 --> 21:50.810
Are you two gonna be done soon,
or maybe we should have a seat?

21:50.883 --> 21:52.161
Come on, honey. Let's sit...

21:52.228 --> 21:55.543
You need to help your mom
with the party arrangements.

21:55.908 --> 21:58.210
We don't want to stress them out, do we?

21:58.594 --> 21:59.577
No.

22:00.066 --> 22:01.592
- All right?
- Yes.

22:02.307 --> 22:06.681
- All right. We're all set.
- I'm glad you all decided. Come on, let's go.

22:06.979 --> 22:09.563
- Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.
- Yeah. All right.

22:09.634 --> 22:13.212
Where is he? Girl!

22:13.282 --> 22:14.710
Oh, my God. Are we being audited?

22:14.785 --> 22:16.347
- No, Keisha.
- What's happening?

22:16.419 --> 22:20.062
This is Simon. This is Theresa's boyfriend.
This is Keisha, her little sister.

22:20.129 --> 22:21.144
Go.

22:21.218 --> 22:24.731
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, this... Yes. Nice to meet you, too.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.617
Good, you all met. Take it to the car.
I'll meet you out there.

22:27.682 --> 22:31.226
- Dad, Theresa's boyfriend is white.
- I know.

22:31.296 --> 22:32.639
I know you know.

22:32.704 --> 22:35.322
I just wanted to see your face
when you heard it again.

22:35.392 --> 22:36.570
Not now.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.602
- Don't forget we have dinner reservations.
- We'll meet you over there.

23:04.863 --> 23:08.922
She was black as the night

23:10.078 --> 23:13.339
Louie was whiter than white

23:14.622 --> 23:15.571
Danger

23:16.062 --> 23:18.200
Take a walk on the wild side

23:18.269 --> 23:20.855
And the colored girls go
doo do doo do doo

23:34.173 --> 23:35.699
Looks like rain.

23:37.181 --> 23:38.228
Nope.

23:40.508 --> 23:44.282
- Those clouds look pretty threatening.
- I live here. I know the weather.

23:47.868 --> 23:52.124
So, Theresa tells me you're in charge
of the loan department at the bank.

23:52.284 --> 23:54.258
That must be a rewarding job.

24:00.698 --> 24:03.416
I'm thinking about making a switch
to a smaller company.

24:03.482 --> 24:05.687
I just think there's less political garbage.

24:05.754 --> 24:08.023
You think I don't deal
with political garbage?

24:08.091 --> 24:10.578
I got political garbage coming out my ass.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.268
If I give a guy a loan,
I'm married to him for 30 years.

24:13.337 --> 24:16.272
If I deny him, I have to deal with him
in church on Sunday.

24:16.346 --> 24:20.142
- I know that feeling.
- Don't try to act like our jobs are alike.

24:23.578 --> 24:25.487
Good thing it isn't raining.

24:26.554 --> 24:28.855
That's not rain. It's sprinkling.

24:29.721 --> 24:32.054
You might want to turn on
the windshield wipers.

24:32.121 --> 24:34.292
I will once it starts raining.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.208
Come on, you two, let's go.

24:40.697 --> 24:43.030
- I don't want to be late. Keisha!
- Coming!

24:43.096 --> 24:44.950
Why you always got to knock
on my door first?

24:45.016 --> 24:46.292
'Cause you still live here.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.464
Let's go. It's raining. I don't wanna be late.

24:50.585 --> 24:51.762
Come on.

24:56.855 --> 24:58.993
Okay, tell me what's it like?

24:59.894 --> 25:02.928
- What's what like?
- Being with a white guy.

25:03.959 --> 25:06.926
- Come on, Keisha, what's the sex like?
- Yeah.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.684
Where's Mom?

25:09.846 --> 25:13.162
She's downstairs, girl. Come on! Bring it.

25:13.237 --> 25:17.613
Okay. You know that thing they say
about the size? Completely the opposite.

25:18.229 --> 25:20.019
- Really?
- They're huge.

25:20.790 --> 25:24.138
And not only are their penises big,
but they can sing.

25:24.853 --> 25:26.708
When they get excited, they sing up a storm.

25:26.774 --> 25:28.878
They know a million tunes.
They're like big iPods.

25:28.949 --> 25:31.250
Cut it out. Stop it.

25:33.461 --> 25:35.534
Keisha, seriously, is he nice?

25:35.796 --> 25:38.131
- Yeah, and he's cute, too.
- I know.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.841
- What about Mom and Dad?
- Mom is cool with it.

25:41.908 --> 25:45.835
I mean, Dad, he seems, you know,
a little on edge, but not more than usual.

25:45.907 --> 25:46.856
Isn't he ever?

25:46.932 --> 25:48.654
- Girls!
- Coming!

25:48.946 --> 25:53.290
But can I just say,
I love you so much right now because...

25:53.364 --> 25:57.487
- Why?
...from now on, no matter what I do, if I...

25:58.131 --> 26:00.683
- crash Dad's car, or if I...
- What's wrong?

26:00.755 --> 26:02.129
...rob a bank...

26:03.027 --> 26:05.646
- if I burn this house down...
- Keisha.

26:05.715 --> 26:09.456
...I won't be the one
who brought home the white boy!

26:13.619 --> 26:14.895
Thank you!

26:18.001 --> 26:18.984
Mom!

26:21.618 --> 26:24.399
- Can I help you with your bag, sir?
- I'm okay. I got it.

26:26.513 --> 26:28.901
You don't trust a working man
with your bag?

26:29.873 --> 26:31.694
No, I just... It's just one bag.

26:31.761 --> 26:34.062
What do you think,
he'll rifle through your luggage...

26:34.128 --> 26:36.616
and steal your toothbrush
and your fancy conditioner?

26:37.521 --> 26:40.335
- No, that's not it at all.
- Let me tell you something.

26:40.402 --> 26:45.069
Theresa's grandfather was a bellman for
over 60 years and he never stole nothing.

26:48.430 --> 26:50.026
Could you get my bag?

26:50.097 --> 26:52.038
What, he's your slave now?

26:52.528 --> 26:53.705
No.

26:53.776 --> 26:56.011
Did you want me to take your bag, sir?

26:57.935 --> 26:59.343
I don't know.

26:59.662 --> 27:00.972
- Next, please.
- Okay.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.773
Hi. Reservation for Percy Jones.

27:06.446 --> 27:08.389
And that's Jones with a "J"?

27:08.463 --> 27:10.120
No, Jones with a "P."

27:10.191 --> 27:12.196
I made the reservation last week.

27:14.126 --> 27:16.646
You knew you were gonna kick me out
a week ago?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.500
Son, I knew I was gonna kick you out
24 years ago...

27:19.565 --> 27:21.540
when the doctor announced it was a girl.

27:21.614 --> 27:23.271
- Here you are.
- Good.

27:23.533 --> 27:25.835
- We gave your room away.
- What?

27:26.510 --> 27:28.004
Check-in was at 4:00.

27:28.077 --> 27:31.077
It's Thursday night. I'm quite sure
you got another room available.

27:31.148 --> 27:33.898
I'm sorry, we're completely booked
and so is everyone else.

27:33.964 --> 27:36.899
There's a Shriners convention
in town, actually.

27:37.901 --> 27:40.770
May I help you with anything else,
Mr. Pjones?

27:42.476 --> 27:44.483
I guess I'll have to stay at your house, then.

27:44.555 --> 27:48.134
No, there's a crack hotel downtown.
You'll be just fine. Come on.

27:50.027 --> 27:51.238
Next.

27:53.163 --> 27:55.072
Hi. Welcome to Cranford.

27:56.011 --> 28:00.004
- I don't know what your basement's like...
- It's damp. You'd hate it.

28:00.746 --> 28:03.649
I don't think dampness is really an issue
at this point.

28:03.723 --> 28:07.367
You can't think about anything but getting
back in the house with my daughter.

28:07.435 --> 28:10.882
Mr. Jones, I'm in your house.
I'll obey your rules.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.440
Yeah, right. You'll obey Mr. Jones now...

28:13.514 --> 28:15.457
but when you're up at 3:00 in the morning...

28:15.531 --> 28:17.352
all hot and horny, you'll obey Mr. Johnson.

28:17.417 --> 28:21.095
You heard the lady. There's no available
hotel rooms in the whole town.

28:21.161 --> 28:24.991
- I'm not gonna do anything. I swear.
- Put your stuff in there. Come on.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.239
You know, dinner's in about 10 minutes.

28:31.304 --> 28:35.134
I don't know what Marilyn is like
about schedule, but I know Theresa is...

28:35.369 --> 28:37.192
Stay out of that storm.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.601
All right. You can stay in my basement.

28:41.895 --> 28:46.205
But you remember one thing.
These eyes, they see everything.

28:46.566 --> 28:48.805
Now get in the car. Come on, let's go.

28:53.639 --> 28:56.257
Ebony, ivory

28:56.360 --> 28:58.693
living in perfect harmony

28:58.759 --> 29:02.620
Ivory, ebony

29:04.008 --> 29:06.592
So, how long have you two been together?

29:06.663 --> 29:08.354
- Five months.
- Six months.

29:08.422 --> 29:09.949
Which one is it?

29:10.917 --> 29:14.300
Well, see, Theresa counts
from the first day that we met.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.640
And I count from the first...

29:20.613 --> 29:23.133
- How's the chicken here?
- It's really good.

29:23.334 --> 29:24.763
Did I tell you two girls...

29:24.838 --> 29:28.001
that for the first dance,
your father and I are gonna do the tango?

29:28.070 --> 29:29.662
- The tango?
- You and Dad?

29:29.733 --> 29:33.508
You know what? Your father and I used to
dance all the time when we were younger.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.712
Sweetheart, I told you
we're not doing a tango.

29:35.781 --> 29:38.268
We're already saying our vows.
That's enough.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.097
We're doing the tango.

29:40.164 --> 29:42.368
Sorry. I forgot to turn it off.

29:44.067 --> 29:46.456
Know what? This is an important call.
I'm just gonna...

29:46.531 --> 29:50.177
No, you can take your call here.
Sit down and take your call.

29:51.108 --> 29:53.660
It's a business call. It's boring stuff.

29:53.731 --> 29:56.862
Business is not boring.
Simon, sit down and take your call.

29:56.930 --> 29:57.879
Sit down.

30:00.835 --> 30:02.241
- Hello.
- Simon?

30:02.306 --> 30:05.689
- Yeah, this is Simon.
- Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.998
I hope Theresa makes good money
as a photographer.

30:08.066 --> 30:10.815
Someone started a rumor
that you're being investigated...

30:10.882 --> 30:12.705
by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

30:15.297 --> 30:18.080
That is so Nathan to do something like that.

30:18.658 --> 30:20.119
I think it's Nathan, too...

30:20.193 --> 30:24.536
'cause this is the last thing he wants to see,
is his best employee going to another firm.

30:24.610 --> 30:25.951
You know me.

30:27.329 --> 30:30.777
- I'm always up for a new challenge.
- Are you listening to me?

30:30.848 --> 30:33.270
- You've been blackballed.
- Great!

30:33.857 --> 30:37.119
Guy, it's not my fault.
I'm just telling you what they told me.

30:37.185 --> 30:38.647
I'll call you next week.

30:38.721 --> 30:41.339
Did Nathan put you up for another award?

30:42.207 --> 30:43.930
Nothing. It's embarrassing.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.547
- Hello. Can I start you off with some drinks?
- Vodka tonic.

30:51.136 --> 30:53.340
Celebrating a great phone call.

30:54.398 --> 30:57.976
Okay. Bring him his liquor,
and bring the rest of us our usual.

30:58.046 --> 31:00.152
They have iced tea and I have my lemonade.

31:00.223 --> 31:03.671
Actually, I think I'm gonna have
a glass of Pinot Grigio.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.612
- And I'll have a Cosmo.
- Me, too.

31:09.183 --> 31:13.044
Okay. Bring them their alcohol
and I'll have my usual lemonade.

31:13.502 --> 31:16.219
Someone has to act responsibly
around here.

31:16.413 --> 31:19.064
So, Simon, I hear that you're a singer.

31:19.645 --> 31:23.191
What are you, a soprano, an alto, or...

31:23.613 --> 31:25.468
No? Maybe bass?

31:28.413 --> 31:29.722
I don't really sing.

31:29.789 --> 31:31.797
How long can you hold a note?

31:31.869 --> 31:33.178
He can hold a note.

31:33.245 --> 31:35.384
- Really?
- For a very long time.

31:35.454 --> 31:37.242
Sing something for me, baby.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.659
Are you okay? Drink some water.

31:42.012 --> 31:42.875
Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles
to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need...

31:42.875 --> 31:45.909
Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles
to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need...

31:46.428 --> 31:48.337
I'm gonna need some cash.

31:49.693 --> 31:53.008
Call me back as soon as you get this.
I need a favor, okay?

32:06.937 --> 32:08.847
You've got to be kidding me.

32:29.273 --> 32:31.606
"Let me see your sexy body go..."

32:35.353 --> 32:38.069
I knew you'd be down here sooner or later.

32:38.265 --> 32:41.264
Did you bring some of that
sexy lingerie for me to try?

32:41.337 --> 32:44.914
What is wrong with you, boy?
Don't you have your own underwear?

32:47.449 --> 32:48.911
You like my space?

32:48.985 --> 32:52.147
Yeah. It's very homey. Interesting odor.

32:52.632 --> 32:54.224
I told you it had mold.

32:54.295 --> 32:58.256
Did you come down here for this?
Having a little trouble writing your vows?

32:58.327 --> 33:00.660
That's none of your damn business.

33:01.432 --> 33:05.686
I'm just saying, I could maybe help you
come up with something romantic.

33:06.295 --> 33:09.228
Don't start thinking that you know more
about romance than I do.

33:09.301 --> 33:11.603
With your hand-holding
and feeding each other food...

33:11.670 --> 33:13.361
and wiping off each other's faces.

33:13.429 --> 33:14.956
That's bullshit.

33:15.318 --> 33:17.806
Being married 25 years, that's real romance.

33:17.878 --> 33:21.652
And believe me, it's a war.
Brutal. Exhausting.

33:24.405 --> 33:27.122
Sounds like someone
just finished their vows.

33:28.917 --> 33:31.536
- Ready for lights out?
- Looks that way.

33:33.173 --> 33:34.864
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:36.821 --> 33:38.827
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:45.973 --> 33:48.722
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready to go to sleep.

33:49.876 --> 33:52.876
- Here? You're sleeping here?
- Right here.

33:53.268 --> 33:56.976
- Don't you have a bed upstairs?
- Sure do. So does Theresa.

33:58.034 --> 34:01.613
By me sleeping here assures me
that she'll get a good night's sleep...

34:01.683 --> 34:03.952
all alone. Good night.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.706
Sorry.

34:16.786 --> 34:20.047
- What are you doing under there?
- It's just a pillow.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.370
- We might need a barrier.
- A barrier for what?

34:23.505 --> 34:25.545
I tend to move around a lot in my sleep.

34:25.618 --> 34:27.657
How do you know you move around
if you're asleep?

34:27.728 --> 34:29.934
Theresa mentioned once that...

34:30.257 --> 34:32.362
I mentioned it to her...

34:32.688 --> 34:34.577
after someone else told me...

34:35.184 --> 34:36.876
that wasn't Theresa.

34:39.984 --> 34:43.366
Okay. We can talk about this, right?
Theresa and I have a...

34:43.438 --> 34:45.862
- No, you can't talk about it.
...healthy relationship...

34:45.936 --> 34:47.659
- Stop!
- We can't talk about this?

34:47.728 --> 34:50.510
I don't wanna hear you talking
about sleeping with my daughter.

34:50.576 --> 34:53.391
You're sleeping with me now.
Now, good night!

36:03.532 --> 36:05.287
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36:05.355 --> 36:06.815
You're up early.

36:06.890 --> 36:09.508
Or late, depending on how you look at it.

36:10.762 --> 36:12.866
- Coffee?
- Yes. Bless you.

36:15.178 --> 36:17.283
I don't know how you sleep with that man.

36:17.354 --> 36:19.775
- Did he get in your space?
- A little bit.

36:20.330 --> 36:21.891
Did he spoon you?

36:22.219 --> 36:25.414
It was more of a wedge maneuver.

36:26.824 --> 36:29.312
Big man likes to cuddle in his sleep.

36:29.866 --> 36:33.345
I just wish he were a little bit more cuddly
when he was awake.

36:33.418 --> 36:37.572
You know, when my father first met
Percy Jones, he could not stand him.

36:37.673 --> 36:38.883
Really?

36:38.952 --> 36:41.123
But eventually they got along, right?

36:41.576 --> 36:42.558
No.

36:43.176 --> 36:46.276
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

36:47.209 --> 36:48.997
Good morning, babe.

36:49.448 --> 36:51.553
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.051
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

36:58.856 --> 37:01.987
- Who's going with me to get some flowers?
- I'll go.

37:02.152 --> 37:05.500
Me, too, if we go early,
because I have to work this afternoon.

37:09.415 --> 37:10.462
Good morning!

37:10.534 --> 37:12.605
You're looking awfully chipper this morning.

37:12.677 --> 37:16.606
Something about knowing your daughter's
not being violated relaxes a man.

37:16.678 --> 37:18.783
I thought you said
that mattress hurts your back.

37:18.854 --> 37:22.302
No, not me.
I could sleep on that mattress every night.

37:23.045 --> 37:24.834
Every single night.

37:48.773 --> 37:51.739
Good morning, boss. Got you some coffee.

37:52.548 --> 37:55.395
- So, what's the verdict?
- What are you talking about?

37:55.459 --> 37:57.347
I'm talking about Theresa's new boyfriend.

37:57.412 --> 38:01.153
What is he, a painter? Poet?
Did he ask you to borrow some money?

38:01.219 --> 38:05.528
My daughter's got great taste in men.
That new guy, he's really something.

38:06.274 --> 38:09.755
- Tell me a little bit about the brother.
- Oh, man, thank you.

38:10.274 --> 38:13.820
I'll tell you about the brother.
He's a big guy. Nice looking.

38:13.890 --> 38:15.799
- What's his name?
- Jamal.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.879
- Graduated Howard University.
- Howard?

38:19.683 --> 38:21.057
Played basketball.

38:21.122 --> 38:24.253
He almost went pro.
Till he changed his career to medicine.

38:24.321 --> 38:26.688
There was a big write-up on him in Jet
four years ago.

38:26.753 --> 38:28.030
No shit.

38:28.417 --> 38:29.911
Parents from Atlanta.

38:29.985 --> 38:33.247
Friends with Mrs. King,
Dr. Cosby, Rev. Jackson.

38:33.313 --> 38:34.655
Come on now.

38:35.521 --> 38:38.619
- Go down towards the middle.
- Go down? Sit up a little bit.

38:39.456 --> 38:42.106
- That's it?
- Man, yeah.

38:44.097 --> 38:47.194
I'm telling you, Reggie.
I'm the luckiest man in Jersey.

38:47.584 --> 38:50.202
My daughter's dating the great black hope.

38:50.271 --> 38:52.059
- You got it.
- That's it.

38:52.127 --> 38:53.949
- Hold it right there.
- I'm not gonna move.

38:58.495 --> 38:59.989
Excuse me? Boss?

39:01.088 --> 39:03.126
Simon Green here to see you.

39:05.534 --> 39:07.161
Lifting, you know.

39:11.037 --> 39:14.071
Cut that off, Reggie. Go on, take it out.

39:14.718 --> 39:17.336
Come on, Reggie.
Get on the ball around the...

39:17.406 --> 39:19.097
I'll be right there.

39:21.085 --> 39:24.314
I'll be right out. Give me... Sign something.

39:28.542 --> 39:32.251
- Fred, who is Simon?
- A friend of Theresa's, he says.

39:32.318 --> 39:35.578
Oh, shit.
He better hope Jamal don't find out.

39:35.836 --> 39:38.202
- Be right with you, sir.
- Great.

39:45.532 --> 39:47.670
- Jerry? Hey.
- Simon, what's up?

39:48.636 --> 39:52.760
Listen. I need you to get me into that
nanotech IPO. I want 10 blocks.

39:52.827 --> 39:54.136
That's $50,000!

39:54.268 --> 39:56.373
Did you inherit a boatload or something?

39:56.443 --> 40:00.120
The initial public offering comes out
on Tuesday. What do you expect me to do?

40:00.186 --> 40:03.481
I know when it comes out.
I set the damn date, okay?

40:04.027 --> 40:05.969
Just buy it for me on margin.

40:06.140 --> 40:08.211
Dude, you don't work here anymore.

40:09.467 --> 40:12.184
I need this IPO to hold me over
until I get another job.

40:12.252 --> 40:14.291
I know you're really screwed right now...

40:14.363 --> 40:16.467
but do you even have $50,000?

40:16.858 --> 40:20.470
I'm gonna sell off my IRAs, okay?
I'll have it in 10 days.

40:20.634 --> 40:22.009
I can't do margin.

40:22.330 --> 40:23.638
I need cash.

40:23.737 --> 40:26.551
I'm in Jersey right now.
Where am I gonna get cash?

40:26.617 --> 40:29.169
I'm sure one of those chemical plants
has an ATM machine.

40:29.241 --> 40:31.794
All right, look. I'll get the cash.
Just put in the order.

40:31.865 --> 40:33.359
Cash by Tuesday.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.287
I'll bring it to you personally on Monday.

40:35.352 --> 40:37.075
Don't punk out on me.

40:39.191 --> 40:40.401
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:40.535 --> 40:42.425
What are you doing here?

40:42.905 --> 40:45.719
I feel like we didn't get off
on the right foot yesterday...

40:45.784 --> 40:47.726
so I thought maybe...

40:47.800 --> 40:50.733
I'd come here and take you to lunch.
Maybe we could bond a little.

40:50.806 --> 40:55.029
I think we bonded just fine around 3:10 this
morning when your knee was in my crotch.

40:55.096 --> 40:56.372
Right.

40:56.792 --> 40:58.003
I'll buy.

40:59.319 --> 41:01.075
- You want to buy me lunch?
- Yeah.

41:01.143 --> 41:05.201
I figured it's the proper thing to do
after sleeping with each other.

41:08.887 --> 41:09.934
Okay.

41:14.135 --> 41:17.003
- So, nice bank.
- I'm glad you like it.

41:18.039 --> 41:22.130
I like the small-town feel.
It's less complicated.

41:22.197 --> 41:25.132
Somebody needs money,
they just come in and say:

41:25.844 --> 41:27.733
"Percy, I need a loan."

41:28.149 --> 41:29.294
Right?

41:30.614 --> 41:33.712
And then, of course, you say,
"Well, yeah. How much?"

41:33.973 --> 41:37.769
They say, "I don't know.
You tell me. $50,000?"

41:38.164 --> 41:40.018
What, you need $50,000?

41:40.531 --> 41:42.442
- Do I need $50,000?
- Yeah.

41:43.541 --> 41:46.159
No. I most assuredly do not.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.040
I was just admiring the process.

41:57.748 --> 42:00.879
How many cylinders does a NASCAR engine
have, six or eight?

42:00.946 --> 42:02.223
- How...
- Yeah.

42:02.292 --> 42:04.624
Six... or eight...

42:07.154 --> 42:11.911
depending on the gas mileage
consumption of the automobile.

42:12.083 --> 42:15.857
You never worked in the pit at NASCAR.
You might as well admit it.

42:16.626 --> 42:18.863
All right, you know, fine.

42:21.074 --> 42:23.757
I never really had an aptitude for engines.

42:23.825 --> 42:25.417
Jay... Jeff...

42:26.194 --> 42:29.839
Jeff Gordon didn't really trust me
in the pit that much.

42:30.353 --> 42:31.947
But you did drive the cars.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.456
- Drive?
- Yeah.

42:33.873 --> 42:35.815
- Absolutely.
- Good.

42:56.815 --> 42:59.717
All right! Fine! I never drove NASCAR!

43:00.111 --> 43:02.598
But I was nervous
and I wanted to impress you.

43:02.671 --> 43:04.560
You shouldn't have lied.

43:05.423 --> 43:09.197
All right. This is the deal.
We go one lap around.

43:09.902 --> 43:12.521
If you beat me, I'll loan you the money.

43:14.829 --> 43:18.344
- Really?
- I knew it! I knew you needed the money.

43:18.414 --> 43:20.235
I don't need the money!

43:47.629 --> 43:49.155
Move over!

43:55.501 --> 43:57.474
Yeah. Fool!

44:10.730 --> 44:11.875
Sucker!

44:51.720 --> 44:53.061
Move it, man!

44:54.985 --> 44:57.024
What the hell are you doing?

45:03.783 --> 45:07.524
- I think it's obvious who came in first.
- You're doggone right. You know I won.

45:07.878 --> 45:12.351
- I was through the bushes before...
- I was through first. I had more speed.

45:12.422 --> 45:14.527
I was through the bushes
and on the asphalt...

45:14.598 --> 45:17.348
- before you even were at the bushes.
- Look.

45:19.335 --> 45:20.992
Dispatch, this is 53 Charlie.

45:21.061 --> 45:24.127
Brian, we got a problem.
Two cars have jumped...

45:27.655 --> 45:29.563
License and registration.

45:33.701 --> 45:36.067
- Poppy!
- There's my beautiful girl.

45:37.412 --> 45:39.203
Simon, I want you to meet my granddad.

45:39.270 --> 45:42.084
- Hi, there. Howard Jones.
- Simon Green. Good to meet you, sir.

45:42.149 --> 45:43.578
Nice to meet you.

45:43.652 --> 45:45.441
- Hey, Speed Racer.
- Hey!

45:45.540 --> 45:48.769
- What's with the white kid?
- That's Simon. He's my boyfriend.

45:48.835 --> 45:51.138
Your boyfriend?
You didn't tell me he was white.

45:51.204 --> 45:52.382
- Yes, I did.
- When?

45:52.452 --> 45:54.427
- Back at the home.
- I thought you was kidding.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.388
Okay. Well, I think that's it.

45:56.803 --> 45:59.191
I think you're forgetting about the vodka.

45:59.266 --> 46:00.827
Say grace, Percy.

46:03.043 --> 46:05.082
Thank you, Lord. Amen.

46:06.914 --> 46:09.534
- That was fast.
- The Lord knows I'm busy.

46:09.731 --> 46:12.697
- Simon, pass on the broccoli, please.
- Yes, sir.

46:12.898 --> 46:16.313
So, what, they don't have any available
young black men in New York anymore?

46:16.386 --> 46:18.457
They just ran out last week, Grandpa.

46:18.530 --> 46:21.978
I'm just trying to figure out
why you chose to go this way.

46:22.050 --> 46:24.254
- Don't mind him.
- It's okay.

46:24.578 --> 46:26.617
My grandmother loved you
when she first met you.

46:26.689 --> 46:29.537
But later she said some things.
I was like, "Wow, Grandma."

46:30.274 --> 46:32.956
- What kind of things?
- Yeah, what kind of things?

46:33.504 --> 46:35.195
Nothing. Just things.

46:35.872 --> 46:37.497
- Such as?
- Yeah, such as?

46:37.568 --> 46:39.609
- Daddy? I got it.
- I know.

46:43.042 --> 46:45.374
You know what?
You're gonna laugh when you hear this.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.735
She said that Theresa was a very pretty girl.

46:50.335 --> 46:52.091
- That's so nice.
- Good taste.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.737
So I ask her
what she liked about you the most, right?

46:55.872 --> 46:57.017
She said...

46:57.088 --> 47:00.797
She says, "I just love
her cute, little, nappy little head."

47:05.758 --> 47:08.661
- Your grandmother, where does she live?
- Brooklyn. Why?

47:08.735 --> 47:12.728
I just wanna know how far I'd have to travel
to kick her old white ass, that's why!

47:12.799 --> 47:14.008
Grandpa.

47:14.238 --> 47:16.344
You don't call my grandchild
no nappy head!

47:16.414 --> 47:19.479
Did she say that while putting on a sheet
for the Klan rally?

47:19.549 --> 47:21.916
Settle down, now! Hand me the butter.

47:21.981 --> 47:24.916
- My grandmother's not a malicious woman.
- No, she's not.

47:24.989 --> 47:27.771
She's 82. She comes from a different time.

47:27.838 --> 47:29.812
I'm 74 and I come from a different time.

47:29.886 --> 47:32.439
You don't hear me calling white folks
honky and flat-ass!

47:32.510 --> 47:33.817
- Casper.
- Cracker.

47:33.884 --> 47:35.313
- Ofay.
- Peckerwood.

47:35.389 --> 47:37.047
- Wonder bread.
- Bird shit.

47:37.115 --> 47:38.263
Bird shit?

47:38.334 --> 47:39.959
It's almost white.

47:40.477 --> 47:41.589
That's pretty good.

47:41.661 --> 47:43.765
Howard. Percy!

47:46.172 --> 47:47.448
It's okay.

47:47.868 --> 47:50.934
I'm really sorry
about what my grandmother said...

47:51.163 --> 47:53.946
but there are some people
you're just never gonna change...

47:54.012 --> 47:55.866
- as much as you'd like to.
- Yep.

47:55.931 --> 47:58.549
I can tell you this. Last Thanksgiving...

47:58.811 --> 48:01.658
my Uncle Dave said a black joke
at the table, right?

48:01.979 --> 48:05.775
So I said, right in front of the whole family,
"Look, that's inappropriate.

48:05.882 --> 48:07.825
"We're not gonna have it."

48:09.402 --> 48:13.264
I think that's how you change people.
You just gotta attack it one at a time.

48:13.338 --> 48:14.352
Exactly.

48:14.426 --> 48:15.953
What was the joke?

48:16.506 --> 48:17.750
Excuse me?

48:19.097 --> 48:20.439
Tell the joke.

48:21.145 --> 48:23.863
- I don't remember it.
- Sure you do. Tell the joke.

48:24.090 --> 48:26.960
- Really, I don't remember it. It was...
- Dad.

48:27.193 --> 48:28.370
Chicken.

48:29.562 --> 48:31.634
- Excuse me?
- I didn't stutter.

48:31.706 --> 48:34.738
Okay, you know what? I'll tell the joke.

48:34.872 --> 48:37.491
- No, Simon. You don't...
- Baby, it's okay.

48:37.754 --> 48:39.181
I'll tell you why.

48:39.257 --> 48:43.250
Because by not telling the joke,
I'm empowering it. Right? So I'll just...

48:44.279 --> 48:47.662
tell the joke and expose
how simple-minded...

48:48.088 --> 48:51.055
and crude and unfunny it actually is.

48:53.208 --> 48:54.898
What do you call...

48:59.798 --> 49:02.930
What do you call 100 black men...

49:03.447 --> 49:05.966
buried in the ground up to their neck?

49:07.192 --> 49:09.166
- What?
- Afro-Turf.

49:12.150 --> 49:14.452
- That's cute.
- What are you laughing at?

49:14.551 --> 49:17.038
- It's cute.
- Cute don't make it funny.

49:17.494 --> 49:18.639
Tell another.

49:18.741 --> 49:21.076
- Dad, no.
- Let the man tell a joke!

49:21.878 --> 49:23.917
I don't know any other ones.

49:25.782 --> 49:30.516
Obviously, I've heard other black jokes,
but I think I've proven my point.

49:30.613 --> 49:33.002
So it's okay to empower the other ones?

49:33.493 --> 49:37.355
Okay. I see what you're doing here,
you're putting me on the spot.

49:37.429 --> 49:40.527
It's okay. Look, it's fine.
'Cause I'm not gonna back down.

49:40.597 --> 49:41.774
Back down, Simon.

49:41.846 --> 49:45.521
The only way to break down barriers
is to have everything out in the open.

49:45.588 --> 49:46.832
- Right?
- Exactly.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.787
So, what do you call...

49:49.556 --> 49:53.353
one black man being chased
by 300 white men?

49:54.131 --> 49:56.618
- What?
- The PGA Tour.

49:58.036 --> 49:59.463
I get it.

49:59.538 --> 50:00.913
Tiger Woods. There it is.

50:01.012 --> 50:02.385
That's good.

50:03.091 --> 50:04.651
Tell another one.

50:07.315 --> 50:10.544
How do we know that Adam and Eve
weren't black?

50:11.538 --> 50:12.486
How?

50:12.562 --> 50:15.629
You ever try to take a rib away
from a black man?

50:18.418 --> 50:19.563
That's pretty good.

50:19.634 --> 50:23.147
- That's pretty good.
- I wouldn't take one from you, I know that!

50:23.218 --> 50:26.415
- You chewing it down to the bone.
- That's a good one.

50:26.769 --> 50:29.998
- He's a rib fan.
- Don't try.

50:30.449 --> 50:31.693
- Tell more.
- Okay.

50:31.761 --> 50:34.063
- Why don't black people like country music?
- Why?

50:34.128 --> 50:38.570
'Cause every time they say "hoe-down,"
they think someone shot their sister.

50:41.841 --> 50:44.141
You gonna be all right?

50:47.024 --> 50:48.551
That is so true.

50:48.656 --> 50:51.787
- That's a tailored joke for you.
- Why I gotta be a ho?

50:51.857 --> 50:53.678
Ain't nobody talking about you.

50:53.744 --> 50:55.434
- It's a sister joke!
- You're sisters.

50:55.504 --> 50:57.097
I'm not the "ho sister."

50:57.168 --> 50:59.501
Come on now. Can't stop now, baby.

50:59.983 --> 51:02.830
What are three things
that a black man can't get?

51:02.895 --> 51:04.999
What is that he can't he get?

51:06.383 --> 51:09.677
A black eye, a fat lip, and a job.

51:15.694 --> 51:18.027
I tell you I'm going to kick this boy's ass!

51:18.094 --> 51:20.777
- Grandpa.
- No, it's...

51:21.486 --> 51:24.781
We know you can take him,
but just sit down. Be nice. Come on.

51:25.806 --> 51:28.740
- Come on, now. It's a joke.
- That's right, Daddy.

51:28.813 --> 51:30.819
Sit down. It's just a joke.

51:31.148 --> 51:33.865
Come on. Hee-hee, ha-ha. That's all it is.

51:37.293 --> 51:39.236
Now if you'll excuse me...

51:39.853 --> 51:41.958
all of a sudden, I lost my appetite.

51:45.515 --> 51:47.337
Think I'll take a walk.

51:56.427 --> 51:59.624
- I should have stopped at "hoe-down."
- You should have never started.

51:59.691 --> 52:02.887
This isn't like us at home,
laughing about this bullshit.

52:02.955 --> 52:04.744
It's my father's house, Simon.

52:04.811 --> 52:07.778
What do you want me to do,
go upstairs and apologize to him again?

52:07.851 --> 52:08.866
No.

52:09.897 --> 52:12.135
Let the storm pass. It'll be fine.

52:13.739 --> 52:15.144
Besides, he dared you!

52:15.210 --> 52:17.348
- He double-dared! He called me chicken.
- I heard!

52:17.417 --> 52:20.713
- I can't be called chicken.
- You have to watch him on those.

52:21.482 --> 52:25.475
You know? I'm fresh out of ideas
as to how to impress your father.

52:26.026 --> 52:29.255
Telling black jokes is never a good idea,
but that's just me.

52:29.322 --> 52:30.598
You think?

52:36.617 --> 52:38.178
I'll talk to him.

52:42.825 --> 52:44.286
Say nice things about me.

52:44.359 --> 52:47.708
No, I'm not going to say nice things
about you. You are still punished.

52:47.816 --> 52:51.647
Baby, I'm a good guy.
I like ribs, too. I don't...

52:54.376 --> 52:56.231
Why are you being so mean to me?

52:56.295 --> 52:58.816
- My grandfather's out there.
- He's not going to come in.

52:58.888 --> 53:01.409
- This is my mom's kitchen!
- She's not going to come in.

53:01.479 --> 53:03.780
You're still gonna do the dishes.

53:05.032 --> 53:07.551
- Get off me.
- Fine, I'll do the dishes.

53:08.038 --> 53:09.980
Here, do the broccoli one.

53:12.903 --> 53:15.771
- Dad, I have to talk to you.
- What?

53:16.102 --> 53:18.916
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't start it. Mr. Nappy Head did.

53:18.981 --> 53:21.600
Dad, Simon's a good man.
He has a good heart.

53:21.670 --> 53:23.809
- A good man?
- You put him on the spot.

53:23.879 --> 53:25.088
You really think so?

53:25.158 --> 53:27.067
What is your problem with him anyways?

53:27.141 --> 53:29.628
Besides the fact, of course, that he's white.

53:29.701 --> 53:33.246
You gonna get in a heap of trouble
talking to me like that.

53:33.540 --> 53:36.957
Don't care nothing about that man
being white. He's hiding something.

53:37.030 --> 53:38.436
What? NASCAR?

53:39.781 --> 53:41.754
You thought I didn't know?

53:42.085 --> 53:45.914
Of course I knew.
We talk about everything, Simon and I.

53:47.556 --> 53:50.971
Daddy, I love him,
and you need to start respecting that.

53:51.396 --> 53:54.842
Then you respect me enough to tell me
in advance who you're bringing home.

53:54.915 --> 53:57.282
- I didn't think you'd care.
- But you weren't sure.

53:57.347 --> 53:59.486
- So you decided to test me.
- No, of course not.

53:59.556 --> 54:01.116
- So you're looking for a reaction?
- No.

54:01.188 --> 54:02.463
So what are you looking for?

54:02.531 --> 54:06.525
I'm looking for you to tell me
that it's okay for me to be with him.

54:14.658 --> 54:15.967
I'm scared.

54:17.794 --> 54:18.841
Okay?

54:19.747 --> 54:21.568
I'm really scared, Dad.

54:22.337 --> 54:25.568
I know things are different now
and times have changed...

54:25.635 --> 54:29.375
but you should really hear the kind of things
that people say to us sometimes.

54:29.441 --> 54:31.480
And the way they look at us.

54:33.888 --> 54:37.086
I need you to tell me
that it's okay to be with him.

54:38.561 --> 54:42.107
Baby, me telling you it's okay
is not gonna change the world.

54:42.176 --> 54:44.511
Dad. But it would change my world.

54:44.800 --> 54:48.149
It will change my world
if I know that you're behind us.

54:48.224 --> 54:50.559
I'm always behind you, sweetheart.

54:51.904 --> 54:53.213
And I love you.

54:54.399 --> 54:56.504
It's my job to keep you safe.

54:57.438 --> 54:59.447
And I don't trust that kid.

55:16.414 --> 55:18.072
- Hey, baby.
- Yes.

55:18.173 --> 55:21.719
I'm trying to figure out where he got
all those doggone black jokes.

55:21.789 --> 55:24.059
What do white people do, take a class...

55:24.126 --> 55:26.514
sit around and think of new jokes
about the black man?

55:26.589 --> 55:28.280
I don't know, Percy.

55:28.573 --> 55:30.613
You need to let that one go.

55:31.229 --> 55:34.677
Come on, sweetheart.
We need to practice the tango.

55:34.750 --> 55:36.888
I told you. I ain't doing no doggone tango.

55:36.958 --> 55:39.707
Why? You think you can't dance anymore?

55:39.772 --> 55:43.186
No. I think the tango's a stupid dance
and I ain't doing it.

55:45.435 --> 55:46.713
Marilyn...

55:47.836 --> 55:51.251
why can't we do the hustle?
What's wrong with the hustle?

55:51.676 --> 55:54.840
Because the hustle is a stupid dance...

55:54.908 --> 55:56.914
and I want to do the tango.

56:00.987 --> 56:03.409
Look here, woman,
can't we do this some other time?

56:03.484 --> 56:05.818
I gotta take Dad back to the home.

56:08.315 --> 56:10.005
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

57:58.387 --> 57:59.336
Shut up!

58:02.739 --> 58:05.934
All right, stop.
Okay, move a little to your left.

58:06.003 --> 58:07.628
- Okay.
- All right, kiss me.

58:07.699 --> 58:10.546
This is the exact spot
where I had my first kiss.

58:10.802 --> 58:14.576
No! I'm not going to kiss you in the spot
that you had your first kiss.

58:14.834 --> 58:16.973
- No.
- Why not?

58:17.522 --> 58:20.042
It's some other guy's spot.

58:21.075 --> 58:22.089
Fine.

58:23.154 --> 58:25.041
- What was his name?
- Curtis Booker.

58:25.106 --> 58:27.374
He had these big old Bucky Beaver teeth.

58:27.442 --> 58:30.474
But he was such a nice boy.
He was a good kisser, too.

58:30.640 --> 58:33.129
- Better than me?
- Way better.

58:33.393 --> 58:34.823
- Way better?
- Yeah.

58:34.897 --> 58:36.687
- Did he grab your ass?
- No.

58:36.753 --> 58:38.639
- Squeeze it?
- No. We were 13.

58:38.705 --> 58:41.071
- Grab you down here?
- No. Come on!

58:43.952 --> 58:45.775
- Slow down.
- Come on.

58:48.432 --> 58:52.009
- There's a car! Get out of the way!
- Come on! Yeah!

58:58.127 --> 58:59.687
Okay, be careful.

59:03.183 --> 59:05.093
So, this is my favorite spot.

59:06.958 --> 59:08.868
It's pretty amazing, huh?

59:09.551 --> 59:11.557
All right, so it's not...

59:11.631 --> 59:14.696
the top of the world, but it's nice.

59:16.687 --> 59:18.061
It's a fort.

59:19.983 --> 59:21.706
It's a gun placement.

59:22.350 --> 59:25.994
When I was little, I would sneak
out of the house in the middle of the night...

59:26.061 --> 59:30.151
and just come out here and just dream.

59:30.669 --> 59:31.749
Yeah?

59:32.718 --> 59:35.139
Weren't you afraid of sneaking
out of your house?

59:35.213 --> 59:37.634
Please. I'm not afraid of Percy Jones.

59:38.830 --> 59:42.723
Well, that makes you and... you.

59:46.476 --> 59:48.680
Okay, so this is just Cranford.

59:49.388 --> 59:53.446
But it's a great place to grow up.
It's a good place to raise a family, too.

59:57.323 --> 59:59.811
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

01:00:00.106 --> 01:00:02.049
What? Live in the suburbs?

01:00:02.379 --> 01:00:05.924
No. Tell your parents
about our engagement this weekend.

01:00:07.242 --> 01:00:10.658
Simon, I told you not to look at him
straight in the eye.

01:00:12.523 --> 01:00:15.010
I don't think Percy Jones is ready.

01:00:15.434 --> 01:00:17.856
I think Percy Jones needs more time.

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.551
A lot more time for Percy Jones.

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:23.647
- Are you getting cold feet, Simon?
- No.

01:00:25.194 --> 01:00:27.332
No, I'm not getting cold feet.

01:00:28.137 --> 01:00:30.079
I can't wait to marry you.

01:00:31.177 --> 01:00:32.902
Make babies with you.

01:00:34.953 --> 01:00:37.768
Give me a daughter that looks just like you.

01:00:41.992 --> 01:00:43.586
I can work on that.

01:00:43.656 --> 01:00:44.997
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:45.832 --> 01:00:48.516
And hopefully, I can be a good dad.

01:00:49.448 --> 01:00:51.587
I think you'll be a great dad.

01:00:51.752 --> 01:00:54.621
You're never gonna be
like your father, Simon.

01:00:58.471 --> 01:01:00.414
Maybe I can be like yours.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.013
- Like Percy?
- Yeah.

01:01:02.087 --> 01:01:04.575
- No.
- Baby, Percy Jones is a good dad.

01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:07.008
He's there for you.

01:01:07.239 --> 01:01:09.922
He cares about you. He loves you so much.

01:01:10.246 --> 01:01:11.424
He does.

01:01:12.551 --> 01:01:14.373
We just have to get him to love you.

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:18.846
Maybe we can start by getting him to take
the padlock off the basement door.

01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:21.628
It's not going to happen.

01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:25.339
Why don't you give me
a little Curtis Booker?

01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:26.908
I can't believe I told you that.

01:01:26.981 --> 01:01:29.698
- Come on, baby, a little Bucky Beaver?
- No.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.412
No. How about some Simon Green?

01:02:07.651 --> 01:02:10.139
Marilyn, you cut off the porch light?

01:02:16.098 --> 01:02:17.560
That's my girl.

01:02:25.057 --> 01:02:26.464
Very stylish.

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:30.688
I need to take a quarter inch off the pants.
I can do it here. Let me have them.

01:02:30.754 --> 01:02:32.314
What, you mean take the pants off?

01:02:32.386 --> 01:02:35.701
I could do with you in them
but I don't want to poke you with my needle.

01:02:35.777 --> 01:02:38.591
You keep your eyes on the pants,
you hear me?

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.549
Mr. Jones, do you know
where the extra chairs are?

01:02:51.616 --> 01:02:53.655
What are you, blind?
They're against the wall.

01:02:53.727 --> 01:02:55.866
- When you go out, close the door.
- Right.

01:02:55.936 --> 01:02:58.718
Percy, put some pants on.
We got people in the house.

01:02:58.784 --> 01:03:01.337
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sweetheart. I didn't realize.

01:03:02.271 --> 01:03:03.515
How long's it gonna take?

01:03:03.583 --> 01:03:06.267
- Two shakes of a lamb's tail.
- Whatever the hell that means.

01:03:06.335 --> 01:03:08.440
Mercy, Percy! Keep your shirt on!

01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:10.419
Or take it off. Whatever.

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:14.035
Could someone answer
that damn phone? Thank you!

01:03:17.149 --> 01:03:20.019
- Jones residence.
- This is Reggie. Who's this?

01:03:21.118 --> 01:03:25.657
- This is Theresa's boyfriend.
- Jamal! What's up, man?

01:03:25.726 --> 01:03:28.693
- Percy told me all about you.
- What's that?

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:31.897
My name is Reggie.
Percy told me all about you, man.

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:33.012
He did?

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:37.111
You know what we should do?
Get together and play some hoops, man.

01:03:37.597 --> 01:03:39.506
I don't really play hoops.

01:03:39.804 --> 01:03:42.260
Come on, man. Don't be shy.
Why are you being shy?

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:46.294
Percy told me that you went to Howard.
He said you almost went pro.

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:47.868
- He said that?
- Yeah.

01:03:47.932 --> 01:03:51.641
He was bragging all about you, Jamal.
But listen...

01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:54.871
two things.
One: Could you autograph the issue...

01:03:54.939 --> 01:03:58.769
of Jet for me? And the other thing is,
I would love to meet the Cosbys.

01:03:58.844 --> 01:04:02.488
When I say love to meet them,
I mean I love to meet them.

01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:05.463
- I'll see what I can do.
- I feel like I grew up with them.

01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:06.938
Let me get Percy for you.

01:04:07.004 --> 01:04:09.686
You know, in the '80s and whatnot and...

01:04:09.755 --> 01:04:13.431
- It's for you. It's Reggie.
- We were talking about the Cosbys.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.596
- May I have some privacy, please?
- But, yeah, you know what I mean?

01:04:17.051 --> 01:04:19.123
- And shut the door.
- I'd still love to meet them.

01:04:19.642 --> 01:04:20.590
Theo...

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.181
Reggie. What did you find out?

01:04:24.249 --> 01:04:27.728
You were right about Simon Green.
He is no longer at J.P. Oliver.

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.744
Come on. Give me my pants.

01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:32.469
- Jamal, huh?
- Don't start.

01:04:32.537 --> 01:04:36.432
This isn't about me. It's about you
and your job, that you don't have anymore.

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:39.188
- What?
- Yeah. Move out of my way.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.693
Hey, baby!

01:04:41.433 --> 01:04:44.150
Theresa! Come here, sweetheart.
Daddy needs to talk to you.

01:04:44.218 --> 01:04:46.867
- Don't listen to him.
- What are you talking about?

01:04:46.937 --> 01:04:50.351
Your boyfriend's unemployed, lost his job.
He got fired a couple days ago.

01:04:50.424 --> 01:04:52.081
I did not get fired! I quit!

01:04:52.152 --> 01:04:54.257
You quit? Why didn't you tell me this?

01:04:54.328 --> 01:04:57.261
- It's complicated.
- It's complicated when you're a liar.

01:04:57.334 --> 01:05:01.458
I'm a liar?
What about the lies you told Reggie?

01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:03.053
- Jamal?
- Who's Jamal?

01:05:03.128 --> 01:05:05.681
- He's good friends with the Cosbys.
- What about NASCAR?

01:05:05.752 --> 01:05:08.085
That was nothing, and I admitted it.

01:05:08.151 --> 01:05:11.281
- You admitted that you lied.
- You tried to kill me with a go-kart.

01:05:11.351 --> 01:05:12.976
At least I can drive.

01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:16.046
This crazy ass almost got us arrested.
Now we both got court dates.

01:05:16.118 --> 01:05:17.908
I can't believe you checked up on me.

01:05:17.974 --> 01:05:20.723
- You kept asking me for money.
- I never asked you for money.

01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:24.171
- You asked my father for money?
- $50,000 loan, baby.

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:26.612
- I did not. He trapped me into it.
- You're a liar.

01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:28.368
You were checking up on him?

01:05:28.438 --> 01:05:31.024
He forced my hand.
You're my daughter and he's not worthy!

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.654
- That's not for you to decide.
- Right!

01:05:32.726 --> 01:05:35.540
And what about you, lying to me?
You said you would never lie.

01:05:35.606 --> 01:05:37.066
You ain't gotta go over there.

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:38.515
I thought I could get another job.

01:05:38.581 --> 01:05:41.483
I was gonna tell you,
but I didn't want to ruin the big weekend.

01:05:41.557 --> 01:05:43.827
You said we would
always tell each other the truth.

01:05:43.893 --> 01:05:46.959
Like how you told your parents
about me being white?

01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:50.737
- I knew they wouldn't care about that.
- I don't care. I care that you're a liar.

01:05:50.804 --> 01:05:54.830
That's bullshit! You care.
He has to care. It's human nature.

01:05:55.412 --> 01:05:57.386
That means that you care that I'm black?

01:05:57.459 --> 01:05:59.215
- Do you?
- Dad!

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:04.264
No. It doesn't matter what I say.
You people are gonna think I'm a racist.

01:06:04.338 --> 01:06:07.918
- You hear that? "You people."
- I know. I heard. What people?

01:06:08.947 --> 01:06:10.801
The people in the yard.

01:06:13.555 --> 01:06:16.522
That's what I'm... See?
I say one thing and I'm a racist!

01:06:16.595 --> 01:06:19.377
- No, Simon, you're a liar.
- And a racist.

01:06:20.274 --> 01:06:23.405
Where do you get off calling me a racist?
I have a black girlfriend!

01:06:23.473 --> 01:06:25.774
- You had a black girlfriend!
- Have.

01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:28.362
Past tense! Had!
And let me tell you something else, son...

01:06:28.434 --> 01:06:31.085
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:34.731
- He got fired from J.P. Oliver!
- I did not get fired! I quit!

01:06:34.802 --> 01:06:37.222
- I told you to stay out of Theresa's life.
- Thank you.

01:06:37.296 --> 01:06:39.881
He can't just walk in our house,
telling our baby lies.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:42.342
- I'm not lying!
- I don't think so!

01:06:43.154 --> 01:06:46.284
- The party's off, Percy.
- Woman, you must be crazy.

01:06:46.353 --> 01:06:49.419
I don't want to say my vows with you.
It would be a lie before God.

01:06:49.488 --> 01:06:51.724
Marilyn, we're saying
some goddamn vows tomorrow.

01:06:51.792 --> 01:06:55.174
- Yeah, he got a book and everything.
- Would you shut up?

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.194
You got your vows out of a book?

01:06:57.265 --> 01:07:01.039
No. Don't listen to him! I got a book.
I'm using it for inspiration.

01:07:01.103 --> 01:07:03.754
- He wrote it down word for word.
- You're going to get hurt.

01:07:03.822 --> 01:07:05.831
- That is so pathetic!
- Come on, Marilyn!

01:07:05.904 --> 01:07:09.317
Because if memory serves me correctly,
I used to be inspiration enough.

01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:10.601
You still are!

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:12.711
You'd be inspiration to me. He neglects you.

01:07:12.783 --> 01:07:15.269
Marilyn, get your ass back here!

01:07:15.343 --> 01:07:17.579
I got a $200 cake coming tomorrow!

01:07:17.646 --> 01:07:21.191
Sixty pounds of shrimp!
Sixty pounds of shrimp, woman!

01:07:21.262 --> 01:07:23.083
I had to take a second on the house!

01:07:23.149 --> 01:07:26.465
- She looked angry.
- Marilyn, don't let me raise my voice now!

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.168
You gonna force me to use the muscle!

01:07:28.238 --> 01:07:29.548
Hope you like seafood.

01:07:37.229 --> 01:07:38.635
Theresa! Wait!

01:07:41.741 --> 01:07:42.919
Come on!

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.565
- They'll be back.
- No, they're not coming back.

01:07:46.636 --> 01:07:49.057
They gotta come back.
Sixty pounds of shrimp!

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:51.074
Come on, baby. Pick it up.

01:07:52.908 --> 01:07:56.289
Answer that phone, sweetheart,
and it will be your last.

01:07:58.957 --> 01:08:00.385
Let me borrow your car.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.006
What? You can't go chasing behind
no women. Have some dignity!

01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:06.180
Besides, you can't even drive
a damn go-kart!

01:08:10.442 --> 01:08:12.133
Trouble in paradise?

01:08:26.825 --> 01:08:29.127
Baby, we need to talk about this.

01:08:29.323 --> 01:08:31.908
You should call me
and we should talk about it like adults...

01:08:31.977 --> 01:08:34.399
because adults communicate
when they have problems.

01:08:34.473 --> 01:08:37.953
I'm looking at your photos on the wall
and they're beautiful.

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:42.756
Beautiful photos. I don't think that
I compliment you on your work enough.

01:08:42.825 --> 01:08:47.462
You know what? You're being rude.
That's what you're being. So call me back.

01:08:50.152 --> 01:08:52.006
Baby, I'm sorry. You're not being rude.

01:08:52.072 --> 01:08:55.071
You have all the reason in the world
to be upset with me right now.

01:08:55.143 --> 01:08:59.169
You shouldn't be calling me back.
If I was you, I wouldn't call me back.

01:08:59.462 --> 01:09:01.122
Baby, call me back.

01:09:01.831 --> 01:09:03.107
Call me back, baby.

01:09:03.175 --> 01:09:06.175
I'm looking at your bulletin board
and there's a picture of you...

01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:09.825
sitting next to a guy and I think
that that guy might be Curtis Booker.

01:09:09.894 --> 01:09:11.716
He looks like he's got Bucky Beaver teeth.

01:09:11.783 --> 01:09:13.986
He looks a lot older than 13!

01:09:14.054 --> 01:09:16.990
So I don't know how you feel about it,
but it's gone!

01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:19.167
Old Curtis Booker can go bye-bye!

01:09:22.085 --> 01:09:24.027
Baby, do you have any Scotch Tape?

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.397
You're acting like I cheated on you,
and I've never cheated on you...

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:31.357
except for that one time with myself,
and you caught me.

01:09:45.924 --> 01:09:46.906
Hello.

01:09:46.981 --> 01:09:49.564
Darlene! How you doing?
This is Percy Jones.

01:09:49.636 --> 01:09:53.497
I'm looking for Marilyn. She left a little
earlier. I thought she'd be back by now.

01:09:53.572 --> 01:09:57.020
- I'm sorry. Now, who is this?
- Percy Jones.

01:09:57.155 --> 01:09:59.904
I'm sorry, Percy.
I must have fell asleep on the couch.

01:09:59.971 --> 01:10:02.075
Baby, you say you looking for Marilyn?

01:10:02.147 --> 01:10:04.384
- Have you seen her?
- Well, now, what happened?

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:06.622
What'd you say to my sister, Percy Jones?

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:09.117
Nothing.

01:10:09.346 --> 01:10:12.346
Listen, if you hear from her,
can you let me know?

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:16.511
Will do. And I look forward to seeing you
tomorrow at the party, right?

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.296
- Yeah, it should be a lot of fun.
- Goodbye.

01:10:30.307 --> 01:10:31.385
Girl!

01:10:32.577 --> 01:10:35.480
You will never guess
who was just on the phone!

01:10:36.353 --> 01:10:38.938
- Who?
- A Mr. Percy A. Jones.

01:10:39.393 --> 01:10:40.921
Percy A. Who?

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:44.982
Yeah, well, baby, he is feeling the pain now!

01:10:46.497 --> 01:10:49.561
Mom. Is that gonna be your last one?

01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:52.479
It might be, baby. And it might not.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.863
You should be over there
trying to work this out with Dad.

01:10:55.937 --> 01:10:59.165
I should be over there trying to work it out
with Simon. Mom, please.

01:10:59.231 --> 01:11:03.061
Child, leave your mom alone.
They ain't going nowhere.

01:11:03.136 --> 01:11:05.852
Your man quit his job and didn't tell you.

01:11:06.175 --> 01:11:08.477
- Got to nip that shit in the bud.
- Yes.

01:11:08.671 --> 01:11:11.061
No. But... Look, I have 15 missed calls.

01:11:11.455 --> 01:11:14.771
- Fifteen, Mom. Fifteen!
- Fifteen?

01:11:14.847 --> 01:11:16.886
Your baby got 15 missed calls!

01:11:16.959 --> 01:11:19.098
- Bullshit. Let him wait!
- That's true.

01:11:19.166 --> 01:11:20.442
I'm gonna call him now.

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:23.891
- No, you're not!
- No. Don't you dare!

01:11:23.966 --> 01:11:26.584
Child, you take your finger off that trigger!

01:11:26.654 --> 01:11:29.589
Did he lie to you, Theresa?
Did he lie to you?

01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:30.971
Yes, he did.

01:11:31.325 --> 01:11:35.122
So, if you don't want him to do it again,
let him feel the pain!

01:11:36.028 --> 01:11:39.804
Look, honey, and if you want him
that bad, you've got to train him.

01:11:41.277 --> 01:11:43.927
My God, if what he's giving you
is that good...

01:11:43.996 --> 01:11:47.541
and then you still don't want him,
send his pasty ass to me!

01:11:51.548 --> 01:11:53.817
- All right, one more!
- Two!

01:11:53.885 --> 01:11:55.542
There you go, baby!

01:12:00.986 --> 01:12:02.646
Here's to you, baby.

01:12:05.691 --> 01:12:08.625
I gotta go to work in the morning. Hello?

01:12:09.435 --> 01:12:12.217
- Sorry, Marcus.
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:12:14.139 --> 01:12:15.666
You want a taste?

01:12:24.698 --> 01:12:26.292
Thank you, Marcus.

01:12:28.249 --> 01:12:29.810
This is my house.

01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:56.306
- She won't answer the phone.
- She don't want to talk to you.

01:12:57.336 --> 01:12:59.604
- Can I get something to drink?
- What, vodka?

01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:03.217
Yes. Vodka. I would like some vodka.

01:13:03.575 --> 01:13:05.397
Sorry, Charlie. No vodka.

01:13:05.463 --> 01:13:09.205
There's gotta be something around here.
Marilyn was throwing an anniversary party.

01:13:09.272 --> 01:13:10.319
Is throwing a party.

01:13:10.391 --> 01:13:11.634
- Was.
- Is.

01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:14.097
- Party's off, dude.
- The party is on, dude.

01:13:14.168 --> 01:13:17.463
You won't find no liquor in here.
This is a Christian home.

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:18.606
Bingo.

01:13:21.877 --> 01:13:23.187
With a house full of sinners.

01:13:23.254 --> 01:13:26.255
Marilyn's got good taste in vodka.
This is, like, a $50 bottle.

01:13:26.327 --> 01:13:28.334
Give me that. Give it here.

01:13:31.765 --> 01:13:34.285
- Can I at least have a little bit?
- No.

01:13:35.092 --> 01:13:36.499
Just a taste.

01:13:38.324 --> 01:13:42.122
Come around here and get those
two glasses over there. Hurry up.

01:13:45.237 --> 01:13:46.665
Who's playing?

01:13:47.252 --> 01:13:49.619
Played. That's history.

01:13:50.228 --> 01:13:52.464
New York Giants' first Super Bowl win.

01:13:52.788 --> 01:13:54.926
Talking about Phil Simms. L.T.

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.201
You ever play?

01:14:06.323 --> 01:14:09.192
- I told you before, no.
- Pitiful.

01:14:18.227 --> 01:14:20.049
All right, let's do it.

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:21.707
Do what?

01:14:31.058 --> 01:14:34.701
- Fumble!
- You said you weren't gonna hit me!

01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:37.420
Touchdown! Yeah, baby.

01:14:38.481 --> 01:14:40.652
- This is where your hands go.
- Where am I gonna be?

01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:43.022
- You're on the bottom. I'm on the top.
- All right.

01:14:43.089 --> 01:14:45.227
Okay, so you hold this frame.

01:14:45.584 --> 01:14:48.235
One and step. Right.

01:14:48.304 --> 01:14:49.678
- I'm leading.
- Okay.

01:14:49.744 --> 01:14:51.304
Back. Nice. Step.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.647
Left. Good. Double-time.

01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:58.541
- Okay, no. See? This is...
- What was wrong with that?

01:14:58.607 --> 01:14:59.948
- You're screwing around.
- I'm not.

01:15:00.015 --> 01:15:02.088
You're getting crazy here,
not holding your frame.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.810
There must be space between us.
Not like when we're sleeping.

01:15:04.879 --> 01:15:06.024
You can't be, like, up here.

01:15:06.095 --> 01:15:09.129
You're not holding your frame.
It's a structured dance.

01:15:09.423 --> 01:15:11.910
- Okay, so back up.
- Your mama taught you this?

01:15:11.983 --> 01:15:14.798
Yes, I used to help her in the dance studio
on the weekends.

01:15:14.863 --> 01:15:16.968
- Step. Two.
- You get fired from there, too?

01:15:17.039 --> 01:15:19.907
No. I didn't get fired from this job. I quit.

01:15:21.197 --> 01:15:24.548
Was it over money? Because if it wasn't,
this doesn't make any sense.

01:15:24.624 --> 01:15:27.405
I had a difference of opinion
with the management.

01:15:27.471 --> 01:15:29.957
They weren't ready for a guy like me.

01:15:32.077 --> 01:15:33.222
I don't get it.

01:15:33.294 --> 01:15:35.267
And heads. No, you're doing great.

01:15:35.341 --> 01:15:38.790
I ain't talking about this.
I'm talking about you and Theresa.

01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:40.804
You ain't got nothing in common.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.731
For example:

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.988
You don't like sports. Theresa loves sports.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.021
You're a businessman. She's an artist.

01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:53.607
You're white. She's black.
Did I miss anything?

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:58.023
No. That's just it. She's everything I'm not.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.660
You know, she's my other half.
Without her, I'm not whole.

01:16:03.979 --> 01:16:06.597
You know, the thing
about meeting your other half is...

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.055
you're walking around,
you think you're happy...

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.308
you think that you're whole.

01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:13.062
Then you realize you ain't shit without her.

01:16:13.131 --> 01:16:14.853
Then you can't go back to being a half...

01:16:14.923 --> 01:16:17.094
'cause now you know what it's like
to be a whole.

01:16:17.163 --> 01:16:18.886
You know what I mean?

01:16:19.721 --> 01:16:21.030
Yeah, I do.

01:16:24.236 --> 01:16:25.893
And I still got it.

01:16:26.186 --> 01:16:27.528
- That was nice.
- Real nice.

01:16:27.594 --> 01:16:29.416
- I liked the snap.
- You like that?

01:16:29.482 --> 01:16:31.140
- I think you hurt me.
- Percy Jones, boy.

01:16:35.177 --> 01:16:36.584
Good morning.

01:16:37.738 --> 01:16:39.908
Looks like I missed a fun night.

01:16:39.977 --> 01:16:44.133
- Just sitting up here, watching football.
- That's how it always starts.

01:16:44.936 --> 01:16:48.482
- Where's Marilyn?
- She stayed all night at Darlene's house.

01:16:48.681 --> 01:16:50.338
She must be really mad.

01:16:50.408 --> 01:16:52.929
Wait. You knew where they were
the whole time?

01:16:53.032 --> 01:16:54.691
Yeah. I thought they'd be back by now.

01:16:54.759 --> 01:16:56.832
- Did you apologize?
- I didn't do anything.

01:16:56.903 --> 01:16:58.212
Exactly!

01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:02.758
Dante, please. Don't try to play
that metrosexual mind game on me, okay?

01:17:03.047 --> 01:17:04.738
Okay. All right.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.831
Let's go get them.

01:17:10.055 --> 01:17:11.779
You don't understand.

01:17:12.518 --> 01:17:16.261
They done called all their friends
and sat up all night ragging on men.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:19.621
They've worked themselves up
into a man-hating frenzy.

01:17:20.549 --> 01:17:23.585
- How many women?
- I guarantee you, large numbers.

01:17:23.656 --> 01:17:24.833
Sisters.

01:17:25.159 --> 01:17:29.119
You can't just walk in on a bunch
of angry black women. You'll die.

01:17:29.925 --> 01:17:32.607
Well, we'll just have to go out like men.

01:17:33.764 --> 01:17:36.253
- He's right, Percy.
- I know he's right.

01:17:36.326 --> 01:17:38.050
But I'm still scared.

01:17:38.342 --> 01:17:40.894
- Keep talking. What are you saying?
- Like that, a little.

01:17:40.965 --> 01:17:42.753
- I'm liking it.
- Thank you.

01:17:42.821 --> 01:17:44.859
You gonna share your colors?

01:17:45.221 --> 01:17:47.325
You're one of them sisters
who don't share colors.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:48.379
No, I'm not.

01:17:48.453 --> 01:17:49.761
Give up your secrets, honey.

01:17:49.827 --> 01:17:53.056
This is gorgeous. Pink Passion.
Every woman needs this.

01:17:53.124 --> 01:17:54.400
A little Pink Passion?

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.678
You know what I always say?

01:17:55.747 --> 01:17:59.360
A little bit of makeup, a little bit of hair
ain't never hurt nobody.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.947
How did I know
she would be wearing Pink Passion?

01:18:07.556 --> 01:18:09.727
- Yes, they're in there.
- Maybe I should go first.

01:18:09.795 --> 01:18:13.177
Are you crazy? I'm the one
that got experience in this sort of thing.

01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.804
You just pay attention.
I'll show you how it's done.

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:17.761
Here, straighten yourself up.

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:20.214
If you go up in there,
you go in looking like a man.

01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:22.265
- Wipe this off.
- You got something.

01:18:22.338 --> 01:18:23.865
Thank you. Yeah.

01:18:25.474 --> 01:18:28.735
- Man, I'm not gonna...
- No. We gotta do this.

01:18:35.874 --> 01:18:37.629
Well, well, well.

01:18:37.698 --> 01:18:40.347
- Lf it isn't Mr. Percy Jones.
- It is I.

01:18:40.417 --> 01:18:42.010
It's about time you showed up.

01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:43.803
- What's up?
- I'm well.

01:18:47.169 --> 01:18:48.891
- Percy.
- Marilyn.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:53.624
Marilyn, may I speak to you in private
over there, please...

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:55.485
so the ladies can continue eating?

01:18:55.553 --> 01:18:57.374
Oh, no! You go on home with that.

01:18:57.438 --> 01:19:00.788
- It's not going down like that, my brother.
- No way, no how.

01:19:00.863 --> 01:19:04.572
You know better than that, Percy.
You got something to say, say it here.

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.134
In front of everybody.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.925
Step up to the chalk line and be a man.

01:19:12.767 --> 01:19:15.417
I married you, didn't I?
Don't that count for something?

01:19:15.486 --> 01:19:17.396
- Hell, no!
- What does he want, an award?

01:19:17.471 --> 01:19:18.844
That don't count for nothing!

01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:20.317
It really doesn't count.

01:19:20.382 --> 01:19:22.871
- Come on, man.
- I know, I'm just...

01:19:28.861 --> 01:19:30.104
Oh, hell.

01:19:30.172 --> 01:19:31.601
I was wrong, okay?

01:19:31.677 --> 01:19:33.750
- It's a good start, Percy.
- Keep going!

01:19:33.821 --> 01:19:36.059
I've been wrong for a long time.

01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:38.458
Ever since I forgot...

01:19:40.029 --> 01:19:41.916
that you are my better half.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:45.016
Hell, Marilyn, you're everything I'm not.

01:19:46.525 --> 01:19:48.532
Without you, I'm not whole.

01:19:50.173 --> 01:19:51.579
Look. Let...

01:19:57.179 --> 01:19:59.798
Baby, before I met you,
I thought I was all that.

01:19:59.868 --> 01:20:03.958
And then you came into my life,
and I realized that I wasn't all that.

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:08.912
Wasn't even half of that.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.448
I might have been a quarter of that.

01:20:11.516 --> 01:20:13.140
But then you left me last night!

01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:16.243
And, baby, I remembered
how it felt to be without you.

01:20:16.314 --> 01:20:19.696
And let me tell you something.
I ain't shit without you!

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:21.169
- Dad.
- Man.

01:20:21.242 --> 01:20:23.131
And I forgot about that.

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:25.679
And I'm sorry.

01:20:31.225 --> 01:20:32.719
Baby, marry me.

01:20:33.881 --> 01:20:35.606
Make me whole again.

01:20:35.674 --> 01:20:38.129
- I love you, Percy.
- I love you, too.

01:20:39.129 --> 01:20:42.062
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- You go, Marilyn, bad girl!

01:20:42.136 --> 01:20:43.598
Kiss your baby.

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:45.844
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

01:20:45.912 --> 01:20:49.076
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I'm sorry, baby.

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:51.733
I feel so much better!

01:20:51.832 --> 01:20:54.133
- Isn't that lovely?
- Get off that.

01:21:03.287 --> 01:21:05.011
I guess it's my turn.

01:21:06.807 --> 01:21:08.084
All right.

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:12.660
That's going to be a tough speech to follow.

01:21:13.432 --> 01:21:15.797
- It was a great speech, Perce.
- Thank you.

01:21:15.863 --> 01:21:19.887
- I had something similar in mind.
- Great minds think alike.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:22.326
Admitting you were wrong
would be a great start.

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.852
Yes, it would.

01:21:25.334 --> 01:21:26.446
Right.

01:21:28.661 --> 01:21:30.090
Go ahead, man.

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.134
Baby, I was wrong!

01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:36.111
What are you doing?

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:41.456
I want to see your sexy body
go bump, bump, bump.

01:21:41.684 --> 01:21:43.691
We have to talk in private.

01:21:44.245 --> 01:21:46.448
I don't wanna hear it. No. Mom?

01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:50.483
Just stay here and talk about it
in front of everybody!

01:21:50.548 --> 01:21:52.010
Ladies, please.

01:21:52.628 --> 01:21:55.116
Take your man
and go work out your business.

01:21:55.188 --> 01:21:56.595
That's right.

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.605
Go on.

01:21:59.764 --> 01:22:00.875
Thank you.

01:22:00.947 --> 01:22:03.184
- Don't let him work on you.
- That ain't right.

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:05.967
- Did he say "bump, bump, bump"?
- Yeah, and it's Percy's fault.

01:22:06.035 --> 01:22:07.279
It's all your fault!

01:22:07.347 --> 01:22:10.959
Those kids are in love and they finally
liked each other and you all interfere.

01:22:11.028 --> 01:22:15.729
My love right here.
Don't tell me how to define my love!

01:22:15.955 --> 01:22:17.514
Lord have mercy.

01:22:22.514 --> 01:22:23.562
Baby.

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:25.707
Come on.

01:22:29.425 --> 01:22:31.431
I was trying to impress your father.

01:22:31.505 --> 01:22:34.506
I didn't want to show up here
and be the unemployed fiancé.

01:22:34.578 --> 01:22:38.254
I've never lied to you before
and I'll never lie to you again, ever.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.102
You lied about asking my father for a loan.

01:22:41.168 --> 01:22:44.366
That was an omission that was tied
to a previous lie. That doesn't...

01:22:44.432 --> 01:22:46.156
And I look like an idiot to you.

01:22:46.225 --> 01:22:50.119
No. You look a little bit
like Percy Jones, though.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.516
I can't believe you're trying to be funny.

01:22:53.584 --> 01:22:56.650
- Baby, come on.
- Why do you have to be funny right now?

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.181
Don't touch me!

01:22:59.856 --> 01:23:01.065
You need to calm down.

01:23:01.135 --> 01:23:04.300
You made me look like an asshole in there.
Don't tell me to calm down.

01:23:04.368 --> 01:23:06.888
I think you were doing
a pretty good job of that yourself.

01:23:06.959 --> 01:23:08.933
Not telling them about me?

01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:12.166
And then I pitched in and I blew it, okay?

01:23:12.239 --> 01:23:14.890
I panicked when I found out
that Nathan was blackballing me.

01:23:14.958 --> 01:23:18.755
I thought if I could score this IPO, I'd have
enough money until I got another job.

01:23:18.831 --> 01:23:22.147
- But I was doing that for you.
- What am I, your mother?

01:23:22.222 --> 01:23:23.782
I don't need you to take care of me.

01:23:23.854 --> 01:23:26.603
I want you to do things with me,
not for me, Simon!

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:28.873
- Will you just talk to me?
- I am talking to you.

01:23:29.069 --> 01:23:31.655
- You're talking at me.
- I am talking to you.

01:23:31.725 --> 01:23:35.239
But you need to talk to me and tell me
how am I supposed to believe in you...

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.513
when you don't trust me enough
to tell me the truth?

01:23:37.581 --> 01:23:41.835
How do we get past this, with this skin,
if we don't have each other's back?

01:23:41.901 --> 01:23:45.578
- Okay, I'm always gonna be the white boy.
- And I'll always be the black girl.

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:49.223
But at least I'm here and willing to deal
with it, and I don't know about you.

01:23:49.293 --> 01:23:53.003
I don't know. And eventually, if you're
gonna quit on me, just do it and don't...

01:23:53.068 --> 01:23:55.304
I'm standing right here!

01:23:55.372 --> 01:23:58.471
What more do you want from me?
What do you want from the white boy?

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.809
I've been here busting my ass
to make you happy!

01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:04.104
Then let me make this easy for you!
The engagement is off!

01:24:04.268 --> 01:24:05.314
Fine.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.081
- Good.
- Great.

01:24:10.155 --> 01:24:11.268
Great.

01:24:28.298 --> 01:24:30.053
I'm in Jersey!

01:24:34.058 --> 01:24:36.807
- Okay, stand still now.
- I'm still.

01:24:39.465 --> 01:24:40.894
You all right?

01:24:43.177 --> 01:24:44.387
I'm fine.

01:24:45.928 --> 01:24:48.799
I'm great. It's going to be a great day, Dad.

01:24:48.873 --> 01:24:52.003
- It sure is.
- Yes. I'm gonna take lots of pictures.

01:24:52.745 --> 01:24:55.592
- So you better smile big for me, okay?
- I will.

01:24:55.656 --> 01:24:58.885
And no crying.
Mom said you cried last time.

01:24:59.016 --> 01:25:01.437
I was not crying, I was sweating...

01:25:01.671 --> 01:25:02.784
from my eyeballs.

01:25:03.879 --> 01:25:06.661
Hell, I was nervous.
I knew I was making a big mistake.

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:08.321
A 25-year mistake.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.948
And going for 25 more.

01:25:13.574 --> 01:25:14.883
Sweetheart?

01:25:15.398 --> 01:25:17.308
Why don't you call that man?

01:25:17.383 --> 01:25:19.772
You know he got his cell phone on.
You know he does.

01:25:19.847 --> 01:25:22.116
He's probably waiting on the 5:15 train.

01:25:22.279 --> 01:25:25.028
We got a party going on.
You get his ass back here!

01:25:25.094 --> 01:25:26.849
How many missed calls you have last night?

01:25:26.917 --> 01:25:28.062
Thirty-three.

01:25:28.133 --> 01:25:30.238
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

01:25:30.565 --> 01:25:32.507
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:36.223
Thirty-three missed calls?
Sweetheart, that's major.

01:25:36.933 --> 01:25:40.992
And you know the man is unemployed, yes,
but he calls you. So give him that.

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.697
Thirty-three missed calls?
And you can't call him once?

01:25:45.893 --> 01:25:48.194
- Girl, don't be so proud.
- No. Daddy, it's not...

01:25:48.261 --> 01:25:51.293
Pride ain't nothing
when it comes to matters of the heart.

01:25:51.364 --> 01:25:52.792
It's not that.

01:25:53.603 --> 01:25:55.677
- It's not?
- No.

01:26:06.243 --> 01:26:09.855
- I was going to marry him.
- What?

01:26:10.659 --> 01:26:13.954
We were going to announce
our engagement this weekend.

01:26:22.434 --> 01:26:23.774
So, you see?

01:26:24.354 --> 01:26:25.695
I have you to thank...

01:26:25.762 --> 01:26:29.307
because you saved me from a big heartache.

01:26:31.425 --> 01:26:34.142
Sweetheart, I just don't
understand something.

01:26:34.209 --> 01:26:37.406
- Why did Simon quit his job?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:41.501
Why would a man quit his job on the day
he's gonna meet his future father-in-law?

01:26:41.568 --> 01:26:45.595
Maybe he got tired of waiting
for that promotion that never happened.

01:26:46.882 --> 01:26:48.888
Simon's a rising star, Dad.

01:26:50.272 --> 01:26:52.508
- He really is.
- I believe that.

01:26:53.055 --> 01:26:55.903
But that boss of his is just not a nice man.

01:26:56.384 --> 01:26:58.870
- You ever met him?
- A couple of times.

01:26:59.424 --> 01:27:02.174
He was always friendly, kind of.

01:27:02.944 --> 01:27:06.588
But he always had
this look in his eyes, you know?

01:27:07.968 --> 01:27:09.657
Just not a nice man.

01:27:10.527 --> 01:27:12.829
But he was Simon's mentor, so...

01:27:13.982 --> 01:27:15.192
Whatever.

01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:17.403
Let it go.

01:27:18.336 --> 01:27:20.342
Today is about you and Mom.

01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:25.113
Now, first picture of the night.

01:27:25.181 --> 01:27:27.636
- Let me get my... On my good side.
- Smile.

01:27:29.726 --> 01:27:32.214
I don't want Mom to see me like this.

01:27:34.302 --> 01:27:37.116
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

01:28:01.147 --> 01:28:02.196
Damn!

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.293
No.

01:28:10.363 --> 01:28:12.185
Do not do this to me, Percy Jones!

01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:16.179
We have a schedule! Tick-tock.
Everything works. Timing.

01:28:16.251 --> 01:28:17.364
I'll be right back.

01:28:17.436 --> 01:28:19.289
- Timing!
- I'll be right back.

01:28:19.388 --> 01:28:21.012
- In 10 minutes?
- Or so, okay?

01:28:21.083 --> 01:28:22.227
How so?

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:26.766
I'm sorry.
Percy, have you met my wife, Diane?

01:28:27.225 --> 01:28:29.778
I certainly have heard
a lot about you, Percy Jones.

01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:31.312
Nice to meet you.

01:28:31.386 --> 01:28:34.201
- Does Marilyn know you're going AWOL?
- Of course.

01:28:35.289 --> 01:28:37.111
She does not.

01:29:48.532 --> 01:29:50.670
So you missed your train, huh?

01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:56.046
- There's another one at 6:00.
- You gonna be on it?

01:29:56.532 --> 01:29:58.735
I should have been on that one.

01:30:02.356 --> 01:30:04.243
What are you doing here?

01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:06.636
I know why you quit your job.

01:30:07.091 --> 01:30:09.775
You told your boss you was coming here
to meet me and he said:

01:30:09.842 --> 01:30:11.980
"Don't marry that black girl."

01:30:14.802 --> 01:30:17.040
Those weren't exactly the words.

01:30:20.050 --> 01:30:22.636
How did you know we were getting married?

01:30:22.738 --> 01:30:25.901
I told you, son.
Don't nothing get past Percy Jones.

01:30:26.097 --> 01:30:28.203
- Theresa told you.
- That, too.

01:30:31.122 --> 01:30:32.845
Come on, man. Let's get real.

01:30:32.915 --> 01:30:36.230
What you did with your boss
was honorable, impressive...

01:30:37.137 --> 01:30:38.413
and stupid.

01:30:38.482 --> 01:30:42.093
You can't quit your job every time
somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you.

01:30:42.161 --> 01:30:44.202
You'll never make any money.

01:30:51.568 --> 01:30:54.884
- How do you do 25 years?
- Painfully.

01:30:57.807 --> 01:30:59.237
No, seriously.

01:30:59.472 --> 01:31:03.050
If you're gonna marry one of these women,
sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell.

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.526
All you can do is admit that you're wrong
and know that she's always right.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.573
- She's right?
- That's right.

01:31:09.646 --> 01:31:10.891
- Always?
- Right.

01:31:10.959 --> 01:31:12.169
- Right.
- That's right.

01:31:12.238 --> 01:31:13.515
All right.

01:31:14.063 --> 01:31:16.397
Okay, what about all the talk
about my dignity?

01:31:16.464 --> 01:31:18.984
Do you love her? Do you want her?

01:31:19.822 --> 01:31:21.710
Then she's always right.

01:31:28.461 --> 01:31:31.277
Look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake.

01:31:31.822 --> 01:31:33.349
And I was wrong.

01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:37.931
And my daughter,
she'd be lucky to have you.

01:31:45.614 --> 01:31:47.718
I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.

01:31:48.653 --> 01:31:50.791
I think I know that about you.

01:31:51.437 --> 01:31:52.963
Theresa doesn't.

01:31:54.413 --> 01:31:57.281
You just have to show her
what you're made of.

01:31:57.451 --> 01:32:00.647
You know she's hot-headed.
She's just like her mama.

01:32:04.461 --> 01:32:07.210
Every man gets to choose his destiny, son.

01:32:08.842 --> 01:32:10.981
No matter what his father did.

01:32:27.914 --> 01:32:30.152
And, Percy, you are not perfect.

01:32:30.379 --> 01:32:33.639
But that works for me because
two perfect people in one relationship...

01:32:33.705 --> 01:32:35.299
might be too much.

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:39.175
And sometimes you bark
and bluff and bluster...

01:32:39.241 --> 01:32:42.241
but I always see the boy I married
25 years ago.

01:32:42.314 --> 01:32:46.307
And I only wish I loved him
as much as I did back then, but I don't.

01:32:51.497 --> 01:32:53.023
I love him more.

01:32:53.161 --> 01:32:55.265
Thank you, Marilyn. That was lovely.

01:32:55.464 --> 01:32:57.438
Percy? Your vows?

01:33:02.856 --> 01:33:04.286
Marilyn Jones.

01:33:04.967 --> 01:33:07.487
Everyone knows I didn't write my vows.

01:33:09.062 --> 01:33:12.062
Everyone knows because you kept
beating me up about it for weeks...

01:33:12.134 --> 01:33:15.006
crying to all your friends. You know?

01:33:15.624 --> 01:33:17.957
Now, look here, woman. I love you.

01:33:19.175 --> 01:33:21.924
But you didn't have to do me like that
about my vows.

01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.858
You know I don't like writing.
She knows that.

01:33:26.437 --> 01:33:28.129
I'm not a wordsmith.

01:33:28.839 --> 01:33:31.741
I do numbers. That's me. I don't do words.

01:33:32.485 --> 01:33:34.176
Damn it, I do money.

01:33:35.237 --> 01:33:38.881
And after 25 years, all I've asked you...

01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:42.368
is to let me be me.

01:33:46.756 --> 01:33:48.992
You'll never find

01:33:50.565 --> 01:33:52.605
As long as you shall live

01:33:53.029 --> 01:33:54.305
Oh, Lord.

01:33:54.532 --> 01:33:56.287
Someone to love you

01:33:56.356 --> 01:33:58.080
Love you, love you

01:33:58.149 --> 01:34:00.220
Tender like I do

01:34:00.291 --> 01:34:01.666
Tender like I do

01:34:01.731 --> 01:34:03.391
You know that about me, woman.

01:34:03.493 --> 01:34:05.728
You'll never find

01:34:07.331 --> 01:34:09.371
No matter where you search

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:10.719
I'm not looking.

01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:12.738
Someone to care about you

01:34:12.802 --> 01:34:14.298
Care about you, care about you

01:34:14.372 --> 01:34:17.883
The way I do

01:34:19.555 --> 01:34:22.751
Oh, I'm not bragging on myself, baby

01:34:23.554 --> 01:34:27.581
But I'm the only one that loves you

01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:33.370
I think I forgot what love is
until you and Simon showed up.

01:34:33.441 --> 01:34:36.027
Give that man another chance, daughter.

01:34:36.577 --> 01:34:38.814
You'll never find

01:34:41.185 --> 01:34:42.331
Simon!

01:34:42.402 --> 01:34:43.929
Yes, Simon.

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:47.447
It'll take the end of all time

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:51.094
Someone who understands you

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:54.971
Like I do

01:34:56.897 --> 01:34:58.456
That's not Jamal.

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.854
I could probably find a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

01:35:09.311 --> 01:35:11.799
But you know what? I don't care.

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:15.515
I don't care, either.

01:35:16.158 --> 01:35:17.500
I love you.

01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:20.092
And I'm sorry that I lied to you.

01:35:20.158 --> 01:35:21.466
I'm sorry, too.

01:35:23.869 --> 01:35:25.277
You're sorry?

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:29.464
- Can you say that again?
- I'm sorry, Simon.

01:35:29.534 --> 01:35:32.119
You're sorry? She said she was sorry.
I believe she's...

01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:33.782
I'm sorry, Simon.

01:35:35.613 --> 01:35:38.199
- Get your man, girl!
- Go ahead, sweetie!

01:35:43.453 --> 01:35:45.656
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

01:35:45.724 --> 01:35:49.718
to introduce to you all
my future son-in-law, Simon Green.

01:35:50.172 --> 01:35:53.400
He's broke, unemployed, and he's white.

01:35:54.269 --> 01:35:57.019
But he loves my Theresa
and that's all right with us.

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:58.032
That's right.

01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:01.526
Welcome to the family, son.
Welcome to the family.

01:36:05.532 --> 01:36:07.156
And cue the magic.

01:36:14.396 --> 01:36:15.442
Look at this.

01:36:15.515 --> 01:36:17.522
Will you look at that shit?

01:36:18.266 --> 01:36:20.437
Drink up! Enjoy!

01:36:22.809 --> 01:36:24.216
Welcome, man.

01:36:41.114 --> 01:36:43.186
- Let's watch the tango.
- No, let's watch the party.

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.309
- All right. Get your feet off the table.
- Sorry, sir.

01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:56.536
- I look pretty good out there.
- You do, Mom.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.309
Baby, you look so good
because you're twirling around me.

01:37:00.376 --> 01:37:02.678
Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go.

01:37:04.215 --> 01:37:05.776
All right, you blew that part.

01:37:05.847 --> 01:37:08.116
- That was perfect.
- There was hesitation there.

01:37:08.182 --> 01:37:10.551
- You did it better the night before.
- The night before?

01:37:10.615 --> 01:37:13.398
- What happened?
- We had a little dry run the night before.

01:37:13.464 --> 01:37:15.286
- Really?
- You didn't tell me that, Percy!

01:37:15.352 --> 01:37:18.612
You're hallucinating, Simon.
I ain't never danced with no man in my life.

01:37:18.678 --> 01:37:19.888
Taught him everything he knows.

01:37:19.958 --> 01:37:22.129
Percy Jones was born
knowing how to tango.

01:37:22.197 --> 01:37:24.467
And let me tell you something
about the tango.

01:37:24.534 --> 01:37:27.285
- It's a structured dance.
- I told you that.

01:37:32.215 --> 01:37:33.457
What was that, Mom?

01:37:33.525 --> 01:37:36.755
You know what that is, Theresa.
You're a grown-ass woman.

01:37:37.269 --> 01:37:39.919
- Damn, Mama, you still got it.
- I know it, Keisha.

01:37:39.989 --> 01:37:42.379
All right now, watch this.
This is when I got funky.

01:37:42.454 --> 01:37:46.642
- Go, Percy! It's your birthday!
- Go, Percy.

01:37:48.501 --> 01:37:49.678
- Let's watch the vows.
- No!

01:37:49.748 --> 01:37:52.681
- Watch the party.
- Okay, fine, whatever.

01:37:55.093 --> 01:37:57.645
- There you are.
- I got her, that girl is mine!

01:37:57.716 --> 01:38:00.400
I was just shocked you didn't fall down.

01:38:00.468 --> 01:38:01.580
That is cold.

01:38:01.653 --> 01:38:04.019
Look. Check me out. I am doing the hustle.

01:38:04.084 --> 01:38:06.222
I'm doing the hustle in your honor,
Percy Jones.

01:38:06.291 --> 01:38:08.843
That ain't no damn hustle.
That's the white man overbite.

01:38:08.914 --> 01:38:11.914
- You ain't even doing that right.
- Why's it gotta be a white thing?

01:38:11.987 --> 01:38:13.231
Blacks have overbites, too.

01:38:13.299 --> 01:38:16.266
- He's doing a great hustle!
- He's turning it up.

01:38:19.794 --> 01:38:21.997
- Why is my man looking at your ass?
- No, he's not.

01:38:22.065 --> 01:38:23.854
Why is your man Samoan?

01:38:23.921 --> 01:38:27.697
- Where is Manu these days?
- We broke up last week.

01:38:27.762 --> 01:38:30.063
- Thank you, Jesus.
- What happened?

01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:32.617
I only started going out with him
to mess with Daddy.

01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:36.105
And, girl, please. He is too big.
He is a bone crusher.

01:38:36.177 --> 01:38:37.867
- Watch your mouth!
- What?

01:38:37.937 --> 01:38:40.524
Do not use the word "bone" in my house.

01:38:50.929 --> 01:38:53.830
- Where were you all going?
- Let's see that again.

01:38:53.904 --> 01:38:56.622
Your mother and I
got a sudden thirst for punch.

01:38:56.784 --> 01:38:58.247
No. You're old enough to know.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.841
We going to shake some sheets.
Is that all right with you?

01:39:00.913 --> 01:39:03.530
I thought you said no bone in the house!

01:39:03.952 --> 01:39:04.967
No!

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:07.973
If everyone wants to see the lift,
we do the lift.

01:39:08.046 --> 01:39:09.477
We're doing the lift!

01:39:09.551 --> 01:39:11.241
This is good.

01:39:11.311 --> 01:39:14.159
No. I was so sure
you were going to drop me there.

01:39:14.672 --> 01:39:15.751
I love you!

01:39:15.823 --> 01:39:18.670
This is Dirty Dancing.
I've been doing this since high school.

01:39:18.734 --> 01:39:19.782
Look at that.

01:39:19.855 --> 01:39:22.342
- Who's the man?
- You did it with other girls?

01:39:22.413 --> 01:39:25.677
No, I only do that with you.

01:39:28.974 --> 01:39:30.435
I know that hurt.

01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:33.705
See that move right there.
That's why you're not getting any grandkids.

01:39:33.773 --> 01:39:37.570
Let me call your mama right now
and thank her for those dance lessons.

01:39:37.645 --> 01:39:39.915
- That's a low blow.
- It's just a joke.

01:39:40.205 --> 01:39:42.888
- Simon!
- Come on. I'll catch your big ass.

01:39:47.021 --> 01:39:48.362
We're down!

01:39:49.677 --> 01:39:51.847
Good thing is, she didn't break that dress.

01:39:51.916 --> 01:39:54.667
No, she didn't,
but she felt bad about it all week.

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.678
They gotta go deep.

01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.951
- I knew better.
- Oh, my God.

01:39:59.019 --> 01:40:01.322
- That was a great party.
- It was, Mom.

01:40:01.389 --> 01:40:04.486
Yeah, I guess a party not a party
till something get broke.
