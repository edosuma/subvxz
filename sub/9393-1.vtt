00:35.060 --> 00:36.461
Hey, everyone.

00:36.495 --> 00:37.895
You'll never guess
who I ran into

00:37.930 --> 00:39.197
at the market just now.

00:39.231 --> 00:41.699
Your hairdresser who's
almost dead from cancer?

00:41.717 --> 00:43.151
Ross Fishman.

00:43.185 --> 00:45.169
Your old boyfriend?
The one with the penis?

00:45.203 --> 00:46.954
Peter, would you stop
being so jealous?

00:46.989 --> 00:48.606
I dated Ross 20 years ago.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.757
That's right.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.559
And that means he had
you first, Lois.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.928
I'll always be Scottie Pippen
to his Michael Jordan.

00:53.962 --> 00:58.349
Ladies and gentlemen,
Michael Jordan!

00:58.383 --> 01:00.068
(cheering)

01:00.102 --> 01:01.552
And Scottie Pippen.
(scattered clapping)

01:01.570 --> 01:02.737
FAN:
He's also good.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.405
FAN 2:
Why didn't they do Jordan last?

01:04.440 --> 01:05.406
FAN 1:
Alphabetical?

01:05.441 --> 01:06.691
FAN 2:
Oh, right. That's smart.

01:06.725 --> 01:07.942
You're smart.
But still.

01:07.993 --> 01:09.627
Peter, don't be ridiculous.

01:09.661 --> 01:11.763
Ross' wife was with him,
and in fact,

01:11.797 --> 01:13.931
they invited us all over
for dinner tonight.

01:13.966 --> 01:15.733
Oh, come on, Lois.
I hate that guy.

01:15.768 --> 01:17.585
I don't want to have dinner with him.
Hey!

01:17.619 --> 01:19.020
It's cooked food
in another house.

01:19.054 --> 01:21.372
That's exciting for
life-over women like me.

01:21.407 --> 01:23.007
We're going.
All right, fine.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.326
But I'm gonna stare at
his wife's boobs so hard

01:25.361 --> 01:27.228
that when they both go
into the kitchen together,

01:27.262 --> 01:29.246
it will be discussed.

01:32.267 --> 01:35.837
Ah, the cold car ride through
a dark, suburban night.

01:35.871 --> 01:37.839
Look out the window and
think of death, kids.

01:37.873 --> 01:39.240
It's a-comin'.

01:43.512 --> 01:44.946
Wow, Pam.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.414
Everything smells terrific.

01:46.448 --> 01:48.049
Did you make all
of this yourself?

01:48.083 --> 01:49.817
Yeah, I just got home from work,

01:49.852 --> 01:51.069
put down the lawyer's briefcase,

01:51.103 --> 01:52.336
and put on the chef's hat.

01:52.371 --> 01:53.504
You know how it is.

01:53.539 --> 01:55.173
Nah. She don't do nothing.

01:55.207 --> 01:58.042
So, Peter, Lois tells me that
you're working at the brewery.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.477
I think that's great.

01:59.511 --> 02:00.695
A real job.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.947
Trading futures,
that's not real.

02:02.981 --> 02:05.450
But the money is unreal.

02:05.484 --> 02:07.118
Hey. To real jobs.

02:07.152 --> 02:08.336
That's it, Fishman.
Shirts off.

02:08.387 --> 02:09.971
I want to see who's
got bigger pecs.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.255
Peter!

02:11.290 --> 02:12.690
Well, they look better
when they're oiled up.

02:12.724 --> 02:13.925
Pass the salad dressing.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.177
Oh, no, it's an almost-empty
squeeze bottle.

02:16.228 --> 02:18.229
Hang on.

02:21.567 --> 02:22.533
Eh, it's all out.

02:22.568 --> 02:23.668
There's dressing on that salad.

02:23.702 --> 02:25.686
Give me that salad.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.956
Yeah, who's
the better man now, Ross?

02:30.075 --> 02:31.492
Brian, what are you
doing down there?

02:31.527 --> 02:32.743
They didn't set
a place for me.

02:32.778 --> 02:33.828
Not a dog family.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.863
Oh.

02:37.583 --> 02:39.367
G'way.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.419
G'way, you.

02:44.923 --> 02:47.125
So, Ben, do you go
to James Woods High?

02:47.159 --> 02:48.292
(chortling):
No.

02:48.327 --> 02:49.560
I'm a junior
at The Meadows.

02:49.595 --> 02:50.711
It's a private school.

02:50.746 --> 02:53.381
Oh, do they do it so right
at The Meadows.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.133
Class size is so small.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.734
And they really
<i>know</i> your child.

02:56.768 --> 02:58.069
They care.

02:58.103 --> 02:59.604
Mr. Wiggins rested his thing

02:59.638 --> 03:02.039
on Jen Crosby's shoulder
during a test.

03:02.074 --> 03:04.575
Yes, I'm told James Woods High
leads the nation

03:04.610 --> 03:06.811
in teacher-to-student
"thing resting."

03:06.845 --> 03:08.679
Well, it's family
that really matters,

03:08.714 --> 03:10.781
and no family is
closer than ours.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.100
That's why we love
taking trips together.

03:13.135 --> 03:15.102
Here we are in Machu Picchu.

03:15.137 --> 03:17.104
Is that the topless place
in South Attleboro?

03:17.139 --> 03:19.207
I spat on a chick there
at a work retreat.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.541
Peter, just stop talking.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.677
What? We been places.
They ain't so great.

03:22.711 --> 03:25.713
Well, this year is perhaps
our biggest trip ever.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.648
We're climbing
Mount Everest.

03:27.683 --> 03:29.016
Oh, yeah?
Is that right?

03:29.051 --> 03:30.852
Well, so are we!
We are?

03:30.886 --> 03:32.520
Peter, I highly doubt that.

03:32.554 --> 03:34.555
I mean, no offense,
but it doesn't look like

03:34.590 --> 03:36.691
your family would
be up to the task.

03:36.725 --> 03:38.025
I think he's right about that.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.161
After all, we couldn't even
turn a double play.

03:40.195 --> 03:42.063
All right, Griffins, on the
ground, we're going to second.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.164
Let's turn two here.

03:43.198 --> 03:44.432
Ground ball's
a double play ball.

03:44.466 --> 03:45.800
Play's at second.
Let's look sharp.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.134
Tough "D." Tough "D."
Let's flash that leather.

03:47.169 --> 03:48.286
Head in the game.
Play's to second.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.504
This infield is
the Great Wall of China:

03:49.538 --> 03:50.738
nothing's getting past us.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.440
Good "D" behind you, Bri.
Good "D" all around.

03:52.474 --> 03:54.008
(bat cracks against ball)

03:54.042 --> 03:55.243
(in Stewie's voice):
I'm okay, everyone.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.894
Don't worry, I am okay.

03:56.929 --> 03:58.229
My voice sounds weird,

03:58.263 --> 04:00.781
this is weird, I know,
but I feel fine.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.554
Man, what a bunch of jerks.

04:06.588 --> 04:08.222
Yeah, we should call
Ross and tell him,

04:08.257 --> 04:10.291
"This is the hospital,
and your mom's dead."

04:10.325 --> 04:12.126
And then, he'll be like,
"What hospital?"

04:12.160 --> 04:14.228
And we'll be like,
"Saint Up Yours,"

04:14.263 --> 04:16.297
and then... and then
that's, like, two jokes.

04:16.331 --> 04:17.415
Look, I'm sorry, Lois.

04:17.449 --> 04:18.849
I-I know we can't
climb Mount Everest.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.468
I-It's just, that guy
really got to me,

04:20.502 --> 04:22.036
and I wanted to
stick it to him.

04:22.070 --> 04:23.571
Will you call tomorrow
and make some excuse

04:23.605 --> 04:24.589
that doesn't
make me look bad?

04:24.623 --> 04:25.690
Ooh, I know.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.924
Tell him I'm a
pathological liar

04:26.959 --> 04:28.659
and that I've been
under a lot of stress

04:28.694 --> 04:31.529
because of the child
rape charges I'm facing.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.431
I think we should do it.
What?

04:33.465 --> 04:34.832
Lois, you can't be serious.

04:34.866 --> 04:36.100
Oh, I'm dead serious.

04:36.134 --> 04:38.152
You think I liked sitting there
pretending to be polite

04:38.203 --> 04:40.437
to those people while they
talked down to us like that?

04:40.455 --> 04:41.822
Well, I'm sick of it.

04:41.857 --> 04:44.825
I'm sick of this family
always feeling second best.

04:44.876 --> 04:47.278
I want to do something
we can be proud of.

04:47.296 --> 04:48.713
I want Stewie,
Meg, and Chris

04:48.747 --> 04:50.781
to grow up
with some confidence.

04:50.799 --> 04:52.917
Then don't buy our shoes
at the car wash.

04:52.951 --> 04:55.786
But climbing the world's
most dangerous mountain?

04:55.821 --> 04:57.255
Isn't that a little extreme?

04:57.289 --> 04:58.289
Maybe.

04:58.323 --> 05:00.358
But if the Fishmans
can do it, so can we.

05:00.392 --> 05:02.593
Yeah, we're just as good as them
or any other family.

05:02.628 --> 05:03.661
That's right.

05:03.695 --> 05:05.329
You guys, we're
climbing Mount Everest.

05:05.364 --> 05:06.731
Let's do it!

05:06.765 --> 05:09.166
Yay! I drank seven cups
of coffee at the Fishmans'!

05:09.201 --> 05:10.184
(knocking)

05:11.236 --> 05:12.520
Oh, crap. It's Quagmire.

05:12.554 --> 05:13.804
I don't want him
knowing about this.

05:13.839 --> 05:15.656
He's always trying
to horn in on our plans.

05:15.691 --> 05:16.841
QUAGMIRE:
Hey, what's going on?

05:16.875 --> 05:18.009
You guys up to something?

05:18.043 --> 05:19.176
Shh-shh, kids, don't move.

05:19.211 --> 05:20.177
(doorknob rattling)
Hello?

05:20.212 --> 05:21.812
(knocking)

05:23.000 --> 05:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:33.427 --> 05:35.028
So we're really doing this?

05:35.062 --> 05:36.863
We're actually gonna
climb Mount Everest?

05:36.897 --> 05:38.081
How are you okay with this?

05:38.115 --> 05:39.332
Well, if we make it
to the summit,

05:39.366 --> 05:41.834
I could pee there,
and then it would be mine.

05:41.869 --> 05:44.337
'Cause the rule is,
the highest pee wins.

05:44.371 --> 05:46.606
Okay, gang, once
we arrive in Nepal,

05:46.640 --> 05:49.058
we'll get all the supplies we
need for the trip up Everest.

05:49.093 --> 05:50.393
Okay, but remember, kids,

05:50.427 --> 05:52.812
the people there have
never seen people before.

05:52.846 --> 05:54.280
So when they walk up to you,

05:54.314 --> 05:55.915
quickly stuff a dollar bill
in their mouth.

05:55.949 --> 05:57.717
And then you can pet 'em
as much as you want.

05:57.751 --> 05:59.185
Is that true, Dad?

05:59.219 --> 06:01.120
Nah, truth is, I don't know
nothing about this place.

06:01.155 --> 06:02.755
I don't even know
why it's called Nepal.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.457
The mountains
look like nipples.

06:04.491 --> 06:06.526
Well, you can't just
call a country Nipples.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.494
What about Nepal?

06:08.529 --> 06:10.229
Ooh, I like that.
Ha.

06:10.264 --> 06:11.881
Shocker: God gets it right.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.839
(car horns honking)

06:19.873 --> 06:21.858
(bicycle bells ringing)

06:23.544 --> 06:26.412
Okay, now, we got to make sure
we've got all the provisions

06:26.447 --> 06:27.847
before we head
up to base camp.

06:27.881 --> 06:29.916
'Cause I don't think there's
gonna be a Star Market

06:29.950 --> 06:31.184
halfway up the mountain.

06:31.218 --> 06:32.752
(all laughing)

06:32.786 --> 06:33.820
Oh, Mom.

06:33.854 --> 06:35.555
That's our local
market at home.

06:35.589 --> 06:36.989
Okay, let's split up

06:37.024 --> 06:39.325
and meet in an hour
in front of The Yak Shack.

06:39.359 --> 06:41.427
And my mom is pounding
on the door,

06:41.462 --> 06:43.463
and I'm like,
"Mom, don't come in here.

06:43.497 --> 06:44.764
I'm yakking off."

06:44.798 --> 06:46.232
MAN:
Boo.

06:46.266 --> 06:49.068
So, I've been carrying this
really promiscuous guide around,

06:49.103 --> 06:50.369
and my back starts itching.

06:50.404 --> 06:51.487
I go to the doctor,

06:51.522 --> 06:53.222
turns out I got sherpies.

06:53.257 --> 06:54.273
PETER:
Ha-ha!

06:54.308 --> 06:55.608
Yeah, I'll meet
you guys here.

06:55.626 --> 06:56.793
I'm just gonna be here.

06:58.929 --> 07:01.264
Peter, I don't think we need
a donkey for this climb.

07:01.298 --> 07:03.166
Of course we don't
<i>need</i> a donkey, Lois.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.383
It's a status thing here.

07:04.418 --> 07:05.635
You, leather man.

07:05.669 --> 07:06.986
You sell me donkey.

07:20.384 --> 07:21.984
I don't know what it is,

07:22.019 --> 07:25.788
but you... have got... it.

07:30.410 --> 07:32.361
(all gasp)

07:42.256 --> 07:44.557
Oh, my God.

07:44.591 --> 07:45.992
It's enormous.

07:46.026 --> 07:48.194
Lois, this is probably a
terrible time to remember this,

07:48.228 --> 07:50.463
but I think I might have
left the weed whacker on.

07:50.497 --> 07:52.498
(engine revving)

07:56.887 --> 07:58.454
Well, look who's here.

07:58.489 --> 08:00.323
I didn't believe you'd actually
follow through with this.

08:00.357 --> 08:01.824
Oh, hey, Fishman.

08:01.859 --> 08:03.693
Hey, listen, on
a scale of one to ten,

08:03.727 --> 08:05.728
how bad is the bathroom
situation up here?

08:05.762 --> 08:07.763
Like, ten is a suite
at the Four Seasons,

08:07.798 --> 08:09.765
and one is
a tied-up raincoat sleeve

08:09.800 --> 08:11.134
at a party in your honor.

08:11.168 --> 08:12.568
Yes, we're here, Ross.

08:12.603 --> 08:14.670
When our family says that
we're gonna do something,

08:14.705 --> 08:15.872
we follow through
with it.

08:15.906 --> 08:18.040
Yeah, in fact, not only
are we gonna climb it,

08:18.075 --> 08:20.042
we are gonna beat
you guys to the top.

08:20.077 --> 08:21.043
(chuckles)

08:21.078 --> 08:22.178
I seriously
doubt that.

08:22.212 --> 08:24.080
Oh, yeah?
Well, so do I!

08:24.114 --> 08:25.648
Yeah, so you watch it, Fishman.

08:25.682 --> 08:27.583
We are gonna beat you so bad,

08:27.618 --> 08:29.819
you'll think you gave
Chris Brown an STD.

08:29.853 --> 08:30.853
Is that what happened?

08:30.888 --> 08:32.621
You're not gonna
beat us to the top.

08:32.655 --> 08:35.024
In fact, you probably won't
even climb Everest at all.

08:35.058 --> 08:36.225
You don't have the nerve.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.393
Like hell I don't.

08:37.427 --> 08:38.895
Getting to the top
ahead of you

08:38.929 --> 08:41.179
is gonna be one of the
greatest moments of my life.

08:41.215 --> 08:43.883
It might even beat graduating
from chiropractor school.

08:43.917 --> 08:45.518
Robert Baker.

08:47.254 --> 08:49.238
Brad O'Bannon.

08:50.407 --> 08:52.408
Anyone.

08:57.965 --> 08:59.799
Okay, the Fishmans are
heading up the North Face,

08:59.833 --> 09:01.100
but I've been studying
this map

09:01.134 --> 09:03.035
and I think we've got a better
chance of beating them

09:03.070 --> 09:04.470
if we go
up the South Face.

09:04.504 --> 09:05.905
Oh, we don't need
a map, Brian.

09:05.939 --> 09:07.874
I got us a GPMS machine.

09:07.908 --> 09:09.075
WOMAN (annoyed):
Go up.

09:09.109 --> 09:10.509
What do you think?
Just go up.

09:10.544 --> 09:12.078
Sorry.

09:12.112 --> 09:14.080
Okay, can everyone
just stop freaking out

09:14.114 --> 09:15.848
and just give me,
like, two minutes?

09:15.883 --> 09:17.850
God!

09:17.885 --> 09:20.253
(crying):
Everyone's always yelling at me.

09:20.287 --> 09:21.888
W... All the questions!

09:21.922 --> 09:23.756
All right, well, maybe
we'll turn you on later

09:23.790 --> 09:25.024
and see how you feel.

09:25.058 --> 09:27.276
She was so nice
in the store.

09:27.311 --> 09:29.612
Well, come on, everyone,
let's get started.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.036

09:38.038 --> 09:40.439
Brian, I'm not sure
I can do this.

09:40.457 --> 09:43.075
It's chillier out here
than Angelina Jolie.

09:43.109 --> 09:44.377
Something like that.

09:44.411 --> 09:46.329
I-I-I don't know,
I-I-I'm so cold.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.798
She took that sad
old lady's husband.

09:48.832 --> 09:50.883
You're just gonna have to
block out the cold, Stewie.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.685
Picture yourself
in a warm place.

09:52.736 --> 09:53.719

13:05.145 --> 13:06.862
Okay...

But he's still
carrying the clubs.

This is so hard!

I can't do
this, Mom!

13:22.512 --> 13:24.797
I think I got altitude sickness.

13:26.883 --> 13:28.333
Hey, Brian, you want
a pukesicle?

13:28.351 --> 13:30.669
I would love a pukesicle.

13:33.273 --> 13:35.858

the top of the mountain!

14:01.334 --> 14:03.252
We made it!
I don't believe it!

14:03.303 --> 14:05.221
We climbed Mount Everest!

14:05.255 --> 14:07.923
Isn't it amazing, Brian?
You can see for...

14:07.958 --> 14:09.959
Oh, you're doing
your pee thing, right.

14:09.993 --> 14:11.894
I don't really know
what the point is.

14:11.928 --> 14:14.263
I mean, there's no way
other dogs can smell this.

14:14.314 --> 14:15.531
Trust me, Stewie.
They'll know.

14:15.565 --> 14:18.234
They'll know
the world is now mine.

14:18.268 --> 14:20.703

14:20.737 --> 14:22.771
(bleep) no way.

14:22.822 --> 14:24.723
Oh, my God, you guys.

14:24.741 --> 14:26.391
I'm so proud
of us all!

14:26.409 --> 14:27.743
We made it!

14:27.777 --> 14:30.112
We proved that
we're not second-best!

14:30.163 --> 14:34.116
ROSS: Well, look
who finally got here.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.701
You, you beat us?

14:35.735 --> 14:37.069
Don't feel too bad, gang.

14:37.103 --> 14:40.172
We only beat you by one hour,
12 minutes, and 43 seconds.

14:40.207 --> 14:42.875
And, quite frankly,
we're bored of it up here.

14:42.909 --> 14:45.811
So you guys enjoy it.
We're gonna head back down.

14:46.947 --> 14:48.314
I hate those guys.

14:48.348 --> 14:49.682
Yeah, me, too.

14:49.716 --> 14:51.300
Come on.
Let's head back down.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.269
At least the hard part's over.

14:53.303 --> 14:54.570
I'm not so sure
about that.

14:54.604 --> 14:56.772
You might want to take a
look at those storm clouds.

14:56.806 --> 14:59.792
(thunder rumbles)

15:05.065 --> 15:06.265
Oh, my God.

15:06.299 --> 15:08.117
Yeah, it looks like
it's closing in fast.

15:08.151 --> 15:09.368
We're all gonna die!

15:09.402 --> 15:11.203
All right, everyone get
into a hilarious pose,

15:11.238 --> 15:12.621
so when they dig out
our bodies,

15:12.656 --> 15:13.923
they'll have a good laugh.

15:16.009 --> 15:18.844
Heh. This guy's
pretty funny.

15:29.155 --> 15:30.570
This is terrible!

15:30.571 --> 15:32.722
The storm keeps
getting worse!

15:32.740 --> 15:34.357
Mom, I can't even see!

15:34.391 --> 15:37.110
And the scarf Brian
called "a gay waste"

15:37.161 --> 15:39.445
makes a rather
important appearance.

15:39.497 --> 15:41.331
I'm so hungry.

15:41.365 --> 15:42.532
Me, too.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.667
I don't know
if I can keep going.

15:44.702 --> 15:46.119
Peter, I still
don't understand.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.671
How the hell can we
already be out of food?

15:48.706 --> 15:50.373
Didn't I tell you
to bring trail mix?

15:50.407 --> 15:52.008
Yeah, but by that
I thought you meant

15:52.042 --> 15:55.612

tunes, which I do have.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.680

15:57.715 --> 15:59.916

16:17.601 --> 16:18.868
I think it's a person.

16:18.903 --> 16:21.070
Oh, my God,
maybe they have food.

16:21.104 --> 16:22.906
Maybe it's a rescue team.

16:34.051 --> 16:36.336
Oh, my God,
it's Ben Fishman.

16:37.388 --> 16:38.388

16:38.422 --> 16:39.839
Yep. He's dead.

caught in this blizzard,

16:41.959 --> 16:44.561
but there's some maniac up here
freezing people to death.

16:44.595 --> 16:46.346
That poor boy.

16:46.397 --> 16:49.265
We should bury him.
It's only right.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.601
Yeah, yeah, we should, Lois.
You're right.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.270
Or we could...

16:54.304 --> 16:55.355
Could what?

16:55.406 --> 16:56.606
Eat him.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.274
(all gasp)
Brian!

16:58.308 --> 17:00.743
Look, if we don't eat something
soon, we're all gonna pass out

17:00.778 --> 17:02.946
from exhaustion and freeze
to death just like him.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.332
Are we really
considering this?

17:06.367 --> 17:08.201
We're talking
about eating a person.

17:08.252 --> 17:10.369
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about this.

17:13.007 --> 17:14.323
Oh, I thought
we decided.

17:14.340 --> 17:15.375
I'm sorry.

17:15.425 --> 17:19.878
Well... I guess
we don't have a choice.

17:24.101 --> 17:26.803
I am oddly prepared for this.

17:29.473 --> 17:31.107
Oh, God, Peter.

17:31.141 --> 17:33.526
I hope Ben would forgive
us for what we did.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.163
Look, we needed to eat,
the same way birds need to fly.

17:37.197 --> 17:39.399
What do you mean, you don't have
our names on there?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.634
My wife and I absolutely have
to be on this flight.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.303
I'm doing the best
I can, sir.

17:43.337 --> 17:44.804
Do you have
your confirmation number?

17:44.838 --> 17:47.907
I think you'll find all the
information you need on here.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.676
Sir, this is just
a piece of paper

17:49.710 --> 17:52.378
with the word "south"
written on it.

17:52.413 --> 17:54.130
Can I speak to your supervisor?

17:54.164 --> 17:57.133
You guys, there's
someone up ahead.

17:58.886 --> 18:00.303
Ben?!

18:00.337 --> 18:01.704
Ben?!

18:01.722 --> 18:03.640
Oh, my God, it's
the Fishmans.

18:03.674 --> 18:05.341
They look terrible.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.310
(wearily):
Have you seen Ben?

18:07.344 --> 18:09.178
We lost him
in the storm.

18:09.212 --> 18:11.064
We're headed back up
to find him.

18:11.098 --> 18:13.382
I just hope he's not trapped
in some crevice somewhere.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.852
Well, my gut tells me
he'll be squeezing himself out

18:15.886 --> 18:17.386
of a crevice very soon.

18:25.162 --> 18:28.364
Oh! We finally made
it below the storm.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.466
Look! I see base camp!

18:30.501 --> 18:36.172
Yay!
We're gonna be okay!

18:36.206 --> 18:37.674
(thunder crashing)

18:39.293 --> 18:42.679
Wait! We have to go back.

18:42.713 --> 18:44.597
What? What are you
talking about?

18:44.631 --> 18:46.766
Kids, your mom is clearly
delirious from the altitude.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.801
I say we leave her
behind and marry

18:48.836 --> 18:50.737
that hot new assistant
from my work.

18:50.771 --> 18:52.472
Look, Ben freezing to
death was one thing.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.507
We had nothing
to do with that.

18:54.541 --> 18:57.276
But we just let Ross and
Pam walk back up there,

18:57.311 --> 18:58.845
probably to
their deaths.

18:58.879 --> 19:01.080
And you know what?
That's not who we are.

19:01.115 --> 19:03.466
We're the Griffins.
And you know how we win?

19:03.500 --> 19:06.319
You know how we keep
from being second-best?

19:06.370 --> 19:07.537
We do the right thing.

19:07.571 --> 19:09.972
We go back up there
and save them.

19:10.007 --> 19:13.076
Tell me again why we ate
a person before we ate the dog.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.560
(sighs) Your mom's right.

19:14.595 --> 19:17.630
Let's head
back up there.

19:17.664 --> 19:19.298
Plus, if we don't rescue
the Fishmans,

19:19.333 --> 19:20.950
their Jewish god is
just gonna sit there

19:20.968 --> 19:22.585
and make us feel guilty.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.888
You do... whatever you want.

19:29.143 --> 19:30.927
(sniffing)

19:30.961 --> 19:32.795
Over here!
I think I smell 'em!

19:37.434 --> 19:40.603
Oh, my God!
Look down there!

19:43.440 --> 19:45.975
We got to get them out!
They'll die down there!

19:45.993 --> 19:47.777
Well, we've got some rope.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.445
(ice cracking)

19:49.479 --> 19:50.913
Quick, Peter!

19:50.948 --> 19:53.315
You're the only one strong
enough to carry two people.

20:04.878 --> 20:06.328
(gasping)

20:12.603 --> 20:14.220
(grunting)

20:18.175 --> 20:20.359
All right, I got 'em!
Pull me up!

20:20.394 --> 20:23.446
(all grunting)

20:23.480 --> 20:25.064
Peter, we can't do it!

20:25.115 --> 20:26.699
You're too heavy!

20:26.733 --> 20:28.317
Keep going!
You're almost there!

20:32.689 --> 20:35.041
I found a rock I like.

20:38.545 --> 20:40.580
Griffins, I don't know
how to thank you.

20:40.631 --> 20:42.482
We never would have made it
without your help.

20:42.516 --> 20:44.383
Oh, you would've done
the same for us.

20:44.418 --> 20:46.252
There are more important things
than a petty rivalry.

20:47.187 --> 20:48.819
We're just happy
that you're okay.

20:48.919 --> 20:50.753
PAM: Well, thank you both.
You saved our lives.

20:51.896 --> 20:54.223
And Peter, I'll never
forget what you did for us.

20:54.224 --> 20:55.908
You're a good man.

20:55.909 --> 20:59.286
All right, you rest up, get better,
we ate your son. Bring it up!
