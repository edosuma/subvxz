Where are you, Bigfoot?

-Hi, lady!
-I'm not a lady.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.999
I was wondering if you would
mind getting one of those
apples for me.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.600
Here, you can have this one.

00:33.667 --> 00:37.138
Actually, I wanted that one
up there.

Your arms are
10 times longer than mine.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.809

creep me out.

-Fine.
-Here, I'll hold
your purse for you.

It's not a purse,
it's a satchel.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.858
Now, listen,

00:57.925 --> 00:59.493
once I give you this apple,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.961
you got to promise
to leave me...

Alone.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.270
Bigfoot!

01:15.976 --> 01:17.478
I was just
keeping an eye on it.
