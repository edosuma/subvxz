01:36.955 --> 01:39.750
Planning a vacation, Mr. Sullivan?

01:40.042 --> 01:46.256
No. No. Just - just some
reading to pass the time.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.472
Step ahead, Mr. Sullivan.

01:53.472 --> 01:57.226
You're expected in Room 102.
Down the hall and to the right.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.144
Thank you.

02:14.076 --> 02:18.372
- What is your name?
- Um- Morgan Sullivan.

02:20.749 --> 02:25.129
- Where were you born?
- Madison, Wisconsin.

02:26.422 --> 02:30.092
- Are you a spy?
- No.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.095
Are you an undercover
operator for Sunways Systems?

02:33.095 --> 02:34.263
No.

02:34.263 --> 02:36.056
Were you paid by Sunways Systems

02:36.056 --> 02:39.101
to steal data from
Digicorp Technologies?

02:39.101 --> 02:40.310
No.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.357
Have you ever worked at any
capacities at Sunways Systems?

02:45.357 --> 02:46.525
No.

02:46.984 --> 02:49.945
This is a technology firm, Mr. Sullivan.

02:49.945 --> 02:52.865
If we choose to employ you
as an agent of Digicorp,

02:52.865 --> 02:54.950
you will spy on other corporations,

02:55.117 --> 02:57.119
inform us of their business plans,

02:57.119 --> 03:00.497
research programs, and
counter-intelligence operations.

03:00.664 --> 03:04.710
Thus far, your determination
has been very impressive.

03:04.918 --> 03:09.840
Well, if there is anything more
I can tell you about myself,

03:10.049 --> 03:13.635
anything that has not been
already checked by Digicorp.

03:13.844 --> 03:17.014
Your personal records are fine. You've
passed our neuro-graph five times.

03:17.222 --> 03:19.475
I'll take the test again
if you'd like me to.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.185
You've been married four years.

03:21.393 --> 03:23.395
You live in a respectable neighborhood.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.606
You've always had stable jobs.

03:26.023 --> 03:27.775
You have an excellent credit history.

03:28.317 --> 03:30.903
No drug habits. No drinking problems.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.030
- You don't smoke?
- No.

03:33.238 --> 03:35.908
No other vices to speak of?

03:36.492 --> 03:39.870
Is there anything else
we should know about you?

03:42.122 --> 03:44.249
Well -- It might
have taken me

03:44.541 --> 03:47.002
quite a while to get to
this point, Mr. Finster,

03:47.002 --> 03:52.633
but now that I'm here, I'm
going to make the most of it.

03:56.178 --> 03:59.098
This is who I am

04:01.225 --> 04:04.353
and this is what I want to do.

04:11.777 --> 04:14.279
The stakes in this line
of work are very high.

04:14.947 --> 04:16.281
Yes, I understand.

04:16.281 --> 04:17.783
It will be like nothing
you've ever done before.

04:17.783 --> 04:19.410
Oh, I'm prepared for that.

04:19.535 --> 04:22.162
You will be sent to
conventions across the country.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.248
You will record the speeches.

04:24.248 --> 04:25.833
That's been made very clear.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.836
You'll have to deceive other people
about what you do for a living.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.839
- Yes.
- Even your own wife.

04:32.548 --> 04:33.841
Yes.

04:33.966 --> 04:36.093
You don't mind lying to your wife?

04:37.636 --> 04:40.389
No.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.144
No, I don't mind.

04:48.814 --> 04:52.151
That was a good one. Move
on ahead to the next station.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.826
- Hello, Mr. Sullivan.
- Hello.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.286
Keep it out of view

05:02.286 --> 05:04.413
until the convention
speeches actually start.

05:04.413 --> 05:05.622
Press the back notch.

05:05.622 --> 05:08.083
You see the flash? It's now on.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.085
Press it again. It's now off.

05:10.127 --> 05:11.837
Easy, isn't it?

05:11.837 --> 05:14.089
And the transmissions are really clear?

05:14.089 --> 05:15.174
Within fifty yards.

05:15.174 --> 05:17.342
Just keep up front for good reception.

05:17.342 --> 05:18.969
Where do the signals go?

05:19.053 --> 05:22.514
Up to our satellite systems,
then back down to our data banks.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.935
I guess the speeches
must be pretty important.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.605
The speeches are not your
concern, Mr. Sullivan.

05:29.646 --> 05:31.065
Just do your job.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.359
Follow our instructions,
nothing else. Do you understand?

05:34.651 --> 05:36.695
Yes, Mr. Finster.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.489
Ready!

05:49.500 --> 05:53.170
Jack Thursby? That's what
you'll be called from now on.

05:53.379 --> 05:57.132
As far as Digicorp concerns,
Morgan Sullivan doesn't exist.

05:57.132 --> 05:59.510
We've never met him. We never will.

06:00.552 --> 06:03.972
- What's he like?
- Pardon?

06:05.766 --> 06:08.477
What's his personality?

06:10.020 --> 06:13.107
He's whoever you want him to be.

07:29.808 --> 07:33.228
Buffalo? Why do they need you
to go all the way to Buffalo?

07:33.437 --> 07:35.397
They want me to tutor them

07:35.522 --> 07:38.984
on that spreadsheet software
I was using at my last job.

07:38.984 --> 07:40.527
And you'll be paid freelance for this?

07:40.527 --> 07:44.073
Sure. Independent contract.

07:45.908 --> 07:50.913
You know, if things work out, there
could be more trips down the road.

07:51.330 --> 07:54.291
I thought we agreed you
weren't going back to work yet.

07:54.917 --> 07:57.878
Not until that position at
my father's firm opened up.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.671
I can do this in the meantime, can't I?

07:59.671 --> 08:02.383
I really need you at
home right now, Morgan,

08:02.383 --> 08:04.176
with me being so busy
with the Williams case.

08:05.094 --> 08:09.723
It's only temporary, honey.
I won't be gone for long.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.164
Hello.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.251
After the convention, you will confirm

08:37.251 --> 08:39.294
the transmission on
your returning flight.

08:39.294 --> 08:40.379
Yes.

08:40.421 --> 08:42.923
Do you remember the
location of the briefcase?

08:42.923 --> 08:44.049
Uh, yes.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.884
Good luck, Mr. Thursby.
We're counting on you.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.344
Thank you.

09:26.341 --> 09:28.469
I left it in the stall.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.464
Something to drink, sir?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.637
I'll have a ginger ale.

10:17.935 --> 10:21.647
- Actually, I'll have a scotch.
- Scotch?

10:22.898 --> 10:25.025
Hmm. Single malt.

10:27.111 --> 10:29.822
- On the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

10:39.998 --> 10:42.501
Welcome to Buffalo, Mr. Thursby.

11:32.426 --> 11:35.679
This is our new mascara line.

11:36.055 --> 11:39.475
- It's hypoallergenic and it's
vitamin enriched. - Really? Mr-

11:39.558 --> 11:46.732
- Fred Garfield.
- Hi. Hi. Jack Thursby.

11:46.982 --> 11:50.027
Fairway Fragrance. Where
are they located exactly?

11:50.736 --> 11:53.447
Uh
- Tulsa. Tulsa, Oklahoma.

11:53.655 --> 11:56.575
You don't say? I've
got family from Tulsa.

11:56.658 --> 11:57.910
You don't have much of an accent.

11:58.535 --> 12:02.373
- I didn't grow up there.
- Oh, where did you grow up?

12:06.335 --> 12:09.088
- I said, where'd you grow up?
- South Pacific.

12:09.213 --> 12:12.925
- I'm sorry, where?
- The South Pacific Islands.

12:13.133 --> 12:17.846
The Tuamotu Archipelago. French
Polynesia. Tahiti. Papeete.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.391
Wow. That's pretty unusual.

12:20.391 --> 12:24.478
Yeah, I plan to go back
there someday when I retire.

12:24.686 --> 12:26.021
Water, sir?

12:28.857 --> 12:32.945
- Thanks.
- Well, see you around, Jack.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.282
Sure thing, Fred.

12:38.951 --> 12:42.579
The conference room will
be open in five minutes.

12:51.380 --> 12:52.631
Good morning, everyone.

12:52.631 --> 12:56.218
My name is Robert Tuttle.
I'll be your first speaker.

12:56.719 --> 12:59.555
I will first discuss shaving
cream distribution outlets

12:59.555 --> 13:01.140
in North American markets.

13:01.140 --> 13:04.768
Let me begin by acknowledging
what has become axiomatic

13:04.768 --> 13:07.146
in the field of shaving
cream distribution.

13:07.604 --> 13:09.273
Mainly that shaving cream,

13:09.273 --> 13:11.984
indeed almost all personal
hygiene products for men,

13:12.109 --> 13:16.447
is what we call fashion resistant.

13:16.822 --> 13:19.450
The overwhelming majority
of shaving cream users

13:19.450 --> 13:21.410
will adopt a brand
and remain loyal to it.

13:21.410 --> 13:23.078
It is especially interesting to note,

13:23.078 --> 13:26.165
the difference in methods
used to penetrate that market.

13:26.165 --> 13:29.668
Because these two methods employed
by the respective companies

13:29.668 --> 13:33.422
really illustrates the essential
strategic choice that faces-

13:35.007 --> 13:37.468
- The Mediterranean.
- Yes.

13:37.885 --> 13:42.097
The Mediterranean is beautiful, of
course; but if it's real sailing you want,

13:42.097 --> 13:47.352
I recommend the Sunda Islands in the Banda
Sea. I was there on a trip last spring.

13:47.561 --> 13:51.523
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- Thank you very much.

13:54.651 --> 13:58.655
Hmm, Cohibas, my
favorite brand. Thank you.

14:00.532 --> 14:04.870
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.922
Would you excuse me?

14:53.877 --> 14:55.629
Good evening, sir. What'll it be?

14:55.671 --> 14:58.799
Give me a scotch. Single
malt, on the rocks.

14:58.799 --> 14:59.925
You got it.

15:05.431 --> 15:07.516
Haven't we seen each other before?

15:09.101 --> 15:12.730
You'll have to come up with
something more original than that.

15:25.617 --> 15:28.203
I'm here for the convention.

15:29.455 --> 15:31.790
That's fascinating.

15:32.124 --> 15:35.878
- You're in marketing, right?
- Uh-uh. Sales.

15:36.086 --> 15:40.340
- Is there a difference?
- What about you?

15:40.549 --> 15:43.719
I do health inspections
of hotel restaurants.

15:43.927 --> 15:46.597
- That sounds interesting.
- No, it doesn't.

15:46.805 --> 15:51.935
- Do you have an answer for everything?
- Yes.

15:59.902 --> 16:02.654
Rita Foster.

16:06.408 --> 16:09.036
Jack Thursby.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.359
So what do you do besides
travel to dull cities

16:40.359 --> 16:42.361
and talk to women in hotel bars?

16:42.903 --> 16:48.033
- I- - uh- play golf.
- Are you any good?

16:50.494 --> 16:55.082
- No.
- Honesty. I like that.

16:55.290 --> 17:00.462
What else do you like?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.550
No commitments. No bullshit.

17:07.469 --> 17:12.141
- And no rings.
- No rings?

17:12.141 --> 17:14.143
You might want to take yours off?

17:17.438 --> 17:19.857
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:24.862 --> 17:27.531
I'll leave you alone now.

17:33.078 --> 17:35.998
Your transmission came
through, Mr. Thursby.

17:35.998 --> 17:37.750
The signal was clear.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.835
I can do something else on my next trip.

17:40.586 --> 17:42.755
I think I'm ready to
handle a bigger assignment.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.466
We'll be sending you
to Omaha next Wednesday.

17:45.716 --> 17:46.884
Omaha?

17:47.092 --> 17:49.887
You'll perform the same job
that you did in Buffalo.

18:27.549 --> 18:31.595
Omaha? Why can't they
find someone in Omaha?

18:33.430 --> 18:38.519
Why do they need to fly you all the
way out there? It doesn't make sense.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.354
Morgan.

18:41.105 --> 18:44.108
Morgan, are you listening to me?

18:48.487 --> 18:52.199
Since when did you ever care about golf?

18:53.992 --> 18:57.830
You're not going on this
trip, Morgan. I'm sorry.

18:58.664 --> 19:00.708
What do you mean, I'm not going?

19:01.166 --> 19:04.503
My father wants you to
come to his office tomorrow.

19:04.503 --> 19:05.462
Getting a position with his company

19:05.462 --> 19:08.340
is more important than
a silly freelance job.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.300
I said I'd go.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.012
You're not going,
Morgan. End of discussion.

19:14.012 --> 19:19.059
You're staying here. I'll call
my father tonight and we'll-

19:19.893 --> 19:22.563
Tell your father to go fuck himself.

19:26.608 --> 19:31.071
What did you just say?
Say you're sorry, Morgan!

19:32.114 --> 19:33.407
Morgan!

19:34.450 --> 19:37.494
If you don't apologize, I
want you out of this house.

19:38.954 --> 19:42.207
Morgan! Are you listening to me?

19:42.541 --> 19:44.543
What in God's name has gotten into you.

19:45.544 --> 19:49.006
Since when did you
start smoking? Morgan!

19:49.548 --> 19:53.469
Morgan, what's going on? I
think I deserve an explanation.

20:00.684 --> 20:03.187
Your scotch, Mr. Thursby.

21:39.241 --> 21:41.493
Turn around slowly, please.

21:49.752 --> 21:51.420
What is your transmission device?

21:51.420 --> 21:54.006
I thought you were a health inspector.

21:56.550 --> 21:58.052
I'll ask you again:

21:58.052 --> 22:00.679
what is your transmission device?

22:02.806 --> 22:04.600
The pen, in my jacket pocket.

22:20.866 --> 22:22.576
Do not turn the pen on.

22:22.576 --> 22:23.827
What?

22:23.911 --> 22:27.081
When you're inside the convention
room, keep the pen turn off.

22:27.706 --> 22:29.458
Do not send the
transmission to Digicorp.

22:29.458 --> 22:33.295
If you tell Digicorp you
met me, they'll kill you.

22:34.755 --> 22:36.548
Take two every six hours,

22:36.548 --> 22:38.717
it will get rid of the
nightmares you've been having.

22:38.717 --> 22:43.972
Your headaches will go away, too,
and the pain in the back of your neck.

22:44.264 --> 22:46.600
How do you know
that I'm having nightmares?

22:46.809 --> 22:48.060
We'll be in touch in Boise.

22:48.268 --> 22:51.647
What will they do if
I don't turn on my pen?

22:53.732 --> 22:59.154
Just remember who you are. You are
Morgan Sullivan. You are not Jack Thursby.

23:10.124 --> 23:12.042
Wait!

23:25.472 --> 23:29.977
Good morning, everyone. I'm Alex
Chen. I'll be your first speaker.

23:30.185 --> 23:33.397
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
here to address the controversy

23:33.939 --> 23:35.190
that's been raging around new techniques

23:35.190 --> 23:37.776
in the preparation of process cheese.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.404
Now at the risk of oversimplifying

23:40.404 --> 23:45.034
the question facing the average
manufacturer of process cheese is this:

23:45.034 --> 23:46.994
Given an increased consumer prejudice

23:46.994 --> 23:48.579
against chemical additives,

23:48.579 --> 23:50.164
how do we stem the tide away

23:50.164 --> 23:52.750
from natural or organic based products
and instil in the cheese buyer.

23:53.292 --> 23:57.296
I'm glad to hear that there were no
problems at the convention, Mr. Thursby.

23:57.504 --> 24:01.425
I'll call down to the lab to make
sure the transmission went through.

24:05.137 --> 24:07.306
Excellent work, Mr. Thursby.

24:08.807 --> 24:09.975
Thank you.

24:09.975 --> 24:11.852
Your transmission
came through perfectly,

24:11.852 --> 24:13.729
just as clear as the last time.

24:14.188 --> 24:17.524
I want you to take
another trip. Boise, Idaho.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.735
Boise?

24:20.069 --> 24:23.155
We scheduled a connecting flight
for you to board when you landed.

24:23.155 --> 24:26.492
You won't have time to go home.
That's not a problem, is it?

24:27.117 --> 24:29.870
No. No problem.

25:31.932 --> 25:34.268
Room 1493, Mr. Thursby.

25:34.393 --> 25:36.562
The convention room
will be open in an hour.

25:36.645 --> 25:38.230
Thank you.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.900
Mr. Thursby! One last thing:

25:42.651 --> 25:46.613
the first letter from each word
is the phone number to call her.

26:18.479 --> 26:19.980
Hello, Mr. Sullivan.

26:19.980 --> 26:23.650
You dialed a special number that
can't be traced or monitored.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.277
Now, listen carefully.

26:25.319 --> 26:27.863
Take the service elevator at the end
of the hall down to the basement level.

26:27.863 --> 26:29.907
You'll be clear for
the next five minutes.

26:29.948 --> 26:31.992
Wait a minute, wait!

26:50.052 --> 26:51.595
Keep moving.

27:10.698 --> 27:14.493
Roll up your sleeve, please.
We don't have much time.

27:22.209 --> 27:25.921
Are you insane? You're
not sticking that into me!

27:26.130 --> 27:28.257
He has medical training, Mr. Sullivan.

27:28.257 --> 27:30.968
I don't care if he's a
fucking brain surgeon!

27:30.968 --> 27:32.177
You're not gonna drug me.

27:32.177 --> 27:33.303
We're undrugging you.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.639
The shot will block out
the Digicorp narcotic.

27:35.639 --> 27:36.724
What?

27:36.724 --> 27:39.685
The chemical they're putting in
your bloodstream at every convention.

27:39.893 --> 27:43.021
Do you normally drink something
inside the convention room?

27:44.189 --> 27:45.232
Mineral water.

27:45.232 --> 27:48.736
The drug is tasteless and
odorless. You wouldn't have known.

27:48.736 --> 27:50.320
Did you take the pills I gave you?

27:50.529 --> 27:53.741
Had the noises in your
head started to go away?

27:53.741 --> 27:57.453
- And the recurring dreams?
- Jesus, what is this?

27:57.661 --> 28:01.248
W-w-why didn't Digicorp check
my transmission in Omaha?

28:01.457 --> 28:03.333
There was no transmission in Omaha.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.919
Or in Buffalo. Or anywhere else.

28:06.003 --> 28:08.297
Why do they send me
to these conventions?

28:09.048 --> 28:11.717
- The conventions are charades.
- Charades?

28:11.717 --> 28:16.638
You and the other convention guests
all work for Digicorp. You're all spies.

28:17.139 --> 28:19.683
You're given phony
assignments, phony identities.

28:19.892 --> 28:22.227
You think your pen
is a transmitting device,

28:22.436 --> 28:25.272
another guest thinks it's
his tie clip or her watch.

28:25.481 --> 28:27.983
The whole thing is just a ploy
to keep you all distracted,

28:28.192 --> 28:30.652
to not realize what's really going on.

28:31.570 --> 28:33.614
What is really going on?

28:35.199 --> 28:39.411
If you want answers, take the shot.

28:50.130 --> 28:52.716
When you're inside the
room, act as you always act.

28:53.175 --> 28:55.135
Order the mineral water. Drink it.

28:55.135 --> 28:56.720
Don't make them suspicious.

28:56.804 --> 28:58.806
The shot we gave you should protect you.

28:59.556 --> 29:02.643
It should protect? What'd
you mean? What if it doesn't?

29:02.810 --> 29:04.978
Listen to me carefully.

29:05.020 --> 29:07.231
Whatever happens in that room,

29:07.690 --> 29:11.819
show no reaction, no
emotion, no surprise.

29:11.819 --> 29:16.824
No matter what you see, do not move.

29:17.741 --> 29:21.370
What will I see?

29:26.083 --> 29:29.712
- Who sent you?
- A friend.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.048
I don't have any friends.

29:33.257 --> 29:38.053
- When will I see you again?
- Soon.

29:39.012 --> 29:41.515
I promise.

29:45.477 --> 29:50.899
There are several points of interest
here. First of all, the fact, that

29:50.899 --> 29:54.278
by an impressive margin,
new home purchases

29:54.570 --> 29:57.197
took most of the brunt of that decline.

29:58.657 --> 30:00.909
By this I mean that sales of older homes

30:00.909 --> 30:02.619
are done on an individual basis

30:02.619 --> 30:05.414
where there's considerably
more room for negotiation.

30:05.414 --> 30:09.626
Therefore, in those sales
we're more likely to find

30:09.710 --> 30:13.464
that the official rise in
mortgage rates has been offset

30:13.464 --> 30:17.843
somewhat by the ...rates of
return on high tech investment,

30:18.052 --> 30:21.221
which led to a surge in
business capital spending

30:21.638 --> 30:25.976
and significantly increased the
underlying growth rate of productivity.

30:25.976 --> 30:30.189
The capitalization of these
higher than expected returns

30:30.189 --> 30:32.024
boosted equity prices

30:32.024 --> 30:37.821
generally beyond even that expected
by the enhanced rise in real incomes.

30:38.072 --> 30:40.657
The elevated level of light
vehicle sales, for example,

30:41.241 --> 30:45.287
has put more vehicles on the road
than the industry could sustain.

30:45.287 --> 30:48.248
And even though demand for
the number of high tech products

30:48.457 --> 30:50.501
was doubling or tripling annually,

30:50.709 --> 30:54.254
in many cases new supply
was coming on ever faster.

30:54.254 --> 30:57.174
Overall capacity in high
tech manufacturing industries

30:57.174 --> 31:00.427
rose nearly 50 percent last year,

31:00.427 --> 31:03.347
well in excess of its
rapid rate of increase.

31:03.389 --> 31:09.061
Accordingly the slowdown in the economy that
began in the middle of last year intensified,

31:09.061 --> 31:13.107
perhaps even to the point of growth
stalling out around the turn of the year.

31:13.315 --> 31:17.403
As the economy slowed,
equity prices fell,

31:17.611 --> 31:20.322
especially in the high tech sector,

31:20.406 --> 31:24.326
where previous high evaluations
were being re-evaluated,

31:24.326 --> 31:28.163
resulting in significant
losses in some investors.

31:28.372 --> 31:31.583
Clearly some slowing in the
pace of spending was necessary,

31:31.792 --> 31:36.505
if the economy was to progress along
balanced and sustainable growth.

31:40.676 --> 31:45.097
<i>With the process likely to intensify
with the rise in the cost of energy</i>

31:45.180 --> 31:49.309
<i>that has strained business
and household purchasing power,</i>

31:49.518 --> 31:52.146
<i>purchases of durable
goods and investment</i>

31:52.354 --> 31:55.315
<i>in capital equipment
declined in the fourth quarter.</i>

31:55.441 --> 31:59.695
<i>Because the slowdown
was not anticipated by business,</i>

31:59.903 --> 32:07.244
<i>it induced some backup in inventories,
despite more advanced technologies...</i>

32:12.541 --> 32:15.711
<i>Inventory sales ratios
rose only moderately,</i>

32:16.211 --> 32:20.007
and even after the policy
actions taken in January,

32:20.007 --> 32:23.927
<i>the risk continue skewed toward
the economies remaining on a path</i>

32:24.178 --> 32:28.140
<i>inconsistent with satisfactory
economic performance.</i>

32:28.557 --> 32:30.809
<i>Crucial to the assessment
of the outlook and the understanding</i>

32:31.101 --> 32:32.811
<i>of recent policy options,</i>

32:33.145 --> 32:36.315
<i>is the role of the technological
change in productivity</i>

32:36.523 --> 32:38.817
<i>in shaping near-term transcyclical forces</i>

32:39.026 --> 32:41.236
<i>as well as long term
sustainable growth,</i>

32:41.445 --> 32:45.491
<i>perceptible for sustaining
slow advances in quality...</i>

33:03.759 --> 33:07.054
Just a reflex.

33:10.557 --> 33:15.104
<i>...Managers appear to be more generally
sanguine about the potential for innovation.</i>

34:11.159 --> 34:16.415
You are not Morgan Sullivan. You are Jack
Thursby. You are not married to Amy Sullivan.

34:16.623 --> 34:20.377
Your wife is Diane Thursby.

34:50.866 --> 34:54.119
Your wife is Diane Thursby.

34:54.328 --> 34:58.624
You live in Redmond, Washington.

35:21.021 --> 35:24.400
<i>Accordingly to foster
financial conditions,</i>

35:24.608 --> 35:29.947
<i>the federal reserve has quickened
the pace of adjustment for its policy,</i>

35:30.155 --> 35:35.577
and in conclusion, a cautious
approach is always the best strategy.

35:38.163 --> 35:40.708
Thank you for your attention.

35:56.932 --> 36:01.061
Excuse me, do you have the time?

36:03.063 --> 36:08.068
- The time? Your watch?
- Yeah, it's 3:30.

36:08.277 --> 36:11.405
Already? Gosh, the last
speech just flew by.

36:11.405 --> 36:12.573
Yeah.

36:12.573 --> 36:15.576
Did you enjoy it?

36:15.784 --> 36:18.954
Oh, yeah. Very much.

36:55.532 --> 36:57.743
Hello?

36:59.161 --> 37:02.206
It's for you.

37:06.126 --> 37:09.630
Digicorp will approach you at the
airport. Tell them you are Jack Thursby.

37:09.838 --> 37:11.924
Tell them you've never
heard of Morgan Sullivan.

37:11.924 --> 37:13.634
Make them think you're brainwashed.

37:13.634 --> 37:16.345
If you're exposed, they'll kill you.

37:16.553 --> 37:18.097
What happened back there?

37:18.347 --> 37:21.266
You're feeling the side effects of
the neutralizing agent in your system.

37:21.350 --> 37:25.145
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

38:04.977 --> 38:08.939
Mr. Sullivan. There's been a
change of plans, Mr. Sullivan.

38:09.148 --> 38:12.151
You need to come to Digicorp's
local office right away.

38:12.234 --> 38:14.445
Mr. Sullivan?

38:15.696 --> 38:17.072
Mr. Sullivan?

38:22.286 --> 38:25.581
Are you all right?

38:25.789 --> 38:31.170
I think you're mistaken.
My name isn't Sullivan.

38:32.629 --> 38:35.632
You're not Morgan Sullivan?

38:35.841 --> 38:40.763
- You don't work for Digicorp?
- No. My name is Thursby. Jack Thursby.

38:41.638 --> 38:45.267
I think you're looking
for somebody else.

38:45.476 --> 38:51.023
I'm sorry, Mr. Thursby. My mistake.

38:51.231 --> 38:54.526
That's okay.

39:14.963 --> 39:17.966
Hello, sir. How are you?

39:19.385 --> 39:21.887
I just need to see your
boarding pass, please. Thank you.

39:40.239 --> 39:41.365
Thank you.

39:41.448 --> 39:43.409
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:46.745 --> 39:50.708
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

41:15.125 --> 41:20.047
Your turn. There's not
much hot water left. Sorry.

41:47.366 --> 41:49.743
Could you make dinner a
half hour earlier tonight?

41:50.911 --> 41:51.995
Sure.

41:51.995 --> 41:54.707
I wrote down a list of
errands I need you to do today.

41:55.290 --> 41:56.417
Okay.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.919
Your car keys are in the
foyer next to your briefcase,

41:59.169 --> 42:00.754
right where you left them.

42:53.057 --> 42:55.893
Planning a trip?

42:56.101 --> 42:58.145
Just some reading to pass the time.

42:58.354 --> 43:00.230
You're expected in
reception, Mr. Thursby.

43:00.606 --> 43:02.524
Down the hall and to the left.

43:12.534 --> 43:16.747
- What's your name?
- Jack Thursby.

43:33.847 --> 43:38.227
My name's Frank Callaway. I'm head
of security for Sunways Systems.

43:41.230 --> 43:45.567
According to your
neuro-graph, you're lying.

43:45.776 --> 43:48.821
You're lying when you say
that your name is Jack Thursby.

43:49.029 --> 43:52.658
You're lying when you say that
you are not an undercover agent.

43:52.866 --> 43:57.663
You are lying when you say that
you do not work for Digicorp.

44:01.792 --> 44:06.380
And I cannot tell you
how happy that makes us.

44:07.715 --> 44:11.009
No way. I am not going
back to that house.

44:11.218 --> 44:13.262
You are in a unique
position here, Morgan.

44:13.470 --> 44:16.932
Digicorp thinks that you're
brainwashed as Jack Thursby.

44:17.141 --> 44:19.184
They think that you passed
our neuro-graph

44:19.393 --> 44:21.562
and they want us to hire you
as one of our agents.

44:21.770 --> 44:22.855
I don't care what they want.

44:22.896 --> 44:26.525
Your counter intelligence work
for Sunways will be very simple.

44:26.525 --> 44:29.653
Digicorp will never suspect
that you're working for us.

44:29.778 --> 44:32.865
So they won't watch you too
closely while you're in the house.

44:32.865 --> 44:36.910
All you have to do is to
place one bug in each room.

44:36.910 --> 44:41.540
You don't fucking understand. I'm
going home. I'm going to my real home.

44:41.749 --> 44:43.292
Your real home is gone, Morgan.

44:43.292 --> 44:44.835
What are you talking about?

44:44.960 --> 44:47.337
Your wife put your house up for sale.

44:47.504 --> 44:51.467
Her lawyer has been trying to
contact you for the last few days.

44:51.675 --> 44:54.303
She filed for divorce three days ago.

44:55.637 --> 44:57.222
I'm sorry, Morgan.

44:59.516 --> 45:02.686
- Look, Morgan, I know this is hard.
- I want to see Rita.

45:02.686 --> 45:05.397
- Who?
- Rita Foster.

45:05.397 --> 45:09.068
- She pulled me out of the brainwashing.
- No, Morgan. You cannot see her.

45:09.276 --> 45:12.738
- Why not? She works for you.
- She does not work for us.

45:12.946 --> 45:15.240
But you sent her to find me
at the hotels, right?

45:15.449 --> 45:16.700
No.

45:17.451 --> 45:21.038
But you know who she works for?

45:22.873 --> 45:25.084
Who does she work for?

45:25.084 --> 45:29.588
- She works for Sebastian Rooks.
- Who's Sebastian Rooks?

45:29.797 --> 45:33.842
Sebastian Rooks is a freelance
operative who we hired

45:34.051 --> 45:36.929
to find out how Digicorp was getting
their agents past our neuro-graph.

45:37.137 --> 45:40.599
Then we asked him to send us
an agent who wasn't brainwashed.

45:41.225 --> 45:42.267
He delivered you.

45:43.477 --> 45:47.481
He's the best in the business, but he's
also very dangerous and very ruthless.

45:47.690 --> 45:51.276
I advise you to stay away from him.

45:51.485 --> 45:55.364
Stay away from him and her.

46:02.996 --> 46:05.290
Look,

46:05.499 --> 46:09.920
we are offering you
a very good deal here.

46:10.129 --> 46:15.551
When your work for us is finished,
we'll give you a new identity

46:15.759 --> 46:21.473
and a new home, somewhere very
far away and safe from Digicorp.

46:22.808 --> 46:24.601
I'm sorry, Mr. Callaway,

46:25.519 --> 46:28.230
but you'll have to find
someone else for your job.

46:33.027 --> 46:35.696
You won't last long out there.

46:35.904 --> 46:37.614
Anywhere you go outside this complex,

46:37.823 --> 46:40.159
Digicorp will have agents watching you.

46:41.035 --> 46:43.954
If you try to run,

46:44.163 --> 46:48.542
if you behave like Morgan
Sullivan instead of Jack Thursby,

46:48.751 --> 46:50.961
they will eliminate you.

46:51.170 --> 46:56.842
Quick. Efficient. Ruthless.

47:05.184 --> 47:09.521
You're fortunate, Morgan. If we hadn't
interrupted the brainwashing process

47:09.730 --> 47:12.566
you'd be like the
other convention guests:

47:12.775 --> 47:16.445
programmed with a new identity and
sent to companies across the globe,

47:16.653 --> 47:21.075
disposed of when you're
no more useful to Digicorp.

47:21.283 --> 47:25.829
You have a chance to fight back.

47:29.333 --> 47:32.920
So, are you ready to be a spy, Morgan?

47:48.686 --> 47:52.189
I'm gonna get some more broccoli.

49:02.092 --> 49:04.845
Phone lines are tapped.

49:07.890 --> 49:11.143
We've got visual in all the rooms.

49:14.938 --> 49:18.484
There they are in the dining room.

49:19.651 --> 49:23.113
The salt shaker gives a
nice angle, doesn't it?

49:23.322 --> 49:25.240
Very well. He believes
he's Jack Thursby.

49:25.449 --> 49:27.910
He believes I'm his wife.
He's adjusted to this house.

49:28.118 --> 49:31.914
- Who's she talking to?
- Digicorp agents.

49:32.122 --> 49:34.833
She's giving them a report on you.

49:35.042 --> 49:37.836
He spends much of his time indoors.

49:37.961 --> 49:41.256
Of course he has no friends and he has
little contact with the outside world.

49:41.256 --> 49:44.510
We've got the Internet lines tapped too.

49:44.718 --> 49:48.555
Excellent work, Morgan. Excellent.

49:48.764 --> 49:51.767
My God.

49:52.768 --> 49:56.397
My life is the same as it ever was.

49:56.605 --> 50:00.317
That's because Digicorp monitored
your old life and then duplicated it.

50:00.526 --> 50:03.070
It helps ease the transition
of becoming another person.

50:03.278 --> 50:06.532
That's not who I am anymore.

50:12.913 --> 50:14.415
I
- I smoke cigarettes.

50:16.375 --> 50:17.918
I like to drink scotch.

50:17.918 --> 50:18.919
I play golf.

50:18.919 --> 50:22.881
I'm not supposed to live in the suburbs.

50:23.090 --> 50:26.677
I'm not supposed to be like that.

50:26.885 --> 50:29.471
I'm sorry if you're
disappointed, Morgan.

50:29.471 --> 50:32.307
But that is your vision of Jack Thursby.

50:32.808 --> 50:36.520
It's not Digicorp's.

50:38.731 --> 50:42.943
Can you guys clean up the
camera reception in that hallway?

51:30.699 --> 51:32.201
Yes, Jamison?

51:34.161 --> 51:37.456
This isn't Jamison. It's
Morgan Sullivan. Bitch.

51:43.504 --> 51:46.757
- What do you want, Mr. Sullivan?
- I need your help.

51:47.299 --> 51:50.135
I want to hire Sebastian Rooks.

51:52.012 --> 51:55.224
- Are you still there?
- Goodbye, Mr. Sullivan.

51:55.432 --> 51:57.768
- I'll pay him for his service.
- He doesn't work for individuals.

51:57.976 --> 51:59.603
Ask him to make an exception.

51:59.812 --> 52:02.606
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're on your own, I'm sorry.

52:02.815 --> 52:05.526
No. No!

52:05.734 --> 52:09.154
- Listen, you gotta help me.
- There's nothing I can-

52:09.154 --> 52:10.406
You gotta help me, please.

52:11.240 --> 52:16.495
You said I could trust you. I
believed you when you said that.

52:16.704 --> 52:21.583
Meet me at the carwash at Fourth
and Jefferson in three hours.

52:27.840 --> 52:33.387
Morgan! We'll be sending you on
your first assignment next week.

52:33.595 --> 52:36.515
Our surveillance of your
house has already paid off.

52:36.515 --> 52:39.768
We know exactly what sort of data
Digicorp is trying to steal from us.

52:40.394 --> 52:45.065
So tonight you will say that you're
going out of town on a business trip.

52:45.274 --> 52:48.360
Now, you know how to
tell her that, right?

52:49.737 --> 52:53.198
- Morgan?
- Yes.

52:58.162 --> 53:00.414
You will stick
to the script, Morgan.

53:01.206 --> 53:04.418
You won't try anything risky,
do you understand me?

53:07.504 --> 53:10.674
Sebastian Rooks has agreed to help you.

53:10.883 --> 53:15.763
- When does he want to meet me?
- Not yet. He's in the car behind us.

53:22.519 --> 53:25.189
- How much money does Rooks want?
- He's not interested in your money.

53:25.189 --> 53:28.108
It's your situation. He thinks
he can use it to his advantage.

53:28.317 --> 53:31.820
- How?
- I'll be in touch with you in Wichita.

53:31.820 --> 53:33.822
Wichita?

53:33.864 --> 53:36.033
That's where Sunways will be
sending you for your last assignment.

53:36.033 --> 53:39.536
How do you know that?
They haven't even told me.

53:39.745 --> 53:42.831
Rooks knows. He knows everything.

53:43.582 --> 53:47.002
- Can I trust Rooks?
- I can't give you guarantees.

53:47.211 --> 53:52.174
But he has the resources to provide
you with a new life, a new identity.

53:52.383 --> 53:54.635
It's your choice, Mr. Sullivan.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.263
What do I have to do?

53:59.306 --> 54:01.600
Sunways will send you on
a series of assignments.

54:03.435 --> 54:06.271
You'll receive a courier
disk on each trip.

54:06.897 --> 54:10.359
Digicorp agents will be
following you wherever you do.

54:10.693 --> 54:13.654
Let them, that's what Sunways wants.

54:21.161 --> 54:24.790
At each destination you'll
be met by a Sunways contact.

54:24.998 --> 54:28.210
They'll download data onto your disk.

54:31.964 --> 54:35.759
Digicorp's agents will assume you're
receiving valuable information.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.473
As you travel to more cities,

54:41.473 --> 54:43.559
collect more data, and
complete more assignments,

54:43.809 --> 54:46.103
your agent status will rise.

54:46.311 --> 54:47.438
Digicorp will then assume you

54:47.438 --> 54:49.940
have become one of
Sunways top company men.

55:01.410 --> 55:03.746
Jack?

55:04.997 --> 55:08.375
Each disk you bring home will
seem more important than the last.

55:12.629 --> 55:15.549
As they copy the Sunways files,
Digicorp will think they have won

55:15.591 --> 55:18.302
a major victory against
their greatest rival.

55:19.553 --> 55:22.431
In reality, Digicorp is the loser.

55:22.848 --> 55:26.852
Sunways is feeding them corrupt data
that will sabotage their operations.

55:28.437 --> 55:30.606
But make no mistake, Mr. Sullivan.

55:30.606 --> 55:33.650
Sunways is just as ruthless as Digicorp.

55:34.610 --> 55:38.697
Once this operation is complete,
they will eliminate you.

55:41.283 --> 55:43.369
Rooks will protect you.

55:46.538 --> 55:49.124
Please. You can trust me.

55:52.544 --> 55:55.756
We're sending you to Kansas. Wichita.

55:57.508 --> 56:00.135
It's almost over, Morgan.

56:00.344 --> 56:04.640
After this trip to the vault,
your work for us will be finished.

56:04.848 --> 56:07.768
- The vault?
- It's our data warehouse.

56:07.976 --> 56:11.939
It's completely isolated from the outside
world, but we send in agent couriers

56:12.147 --> 56:14.274
if we need to retrieve or add a file.

56:15.943 --> 56:19.321
You will be our next courier.

56:20.489 --> 56:26.412
And Digicorp will they
have hit the mother lode.

56:59.820 --> 57:06.827
Shh! We need to keep our voices down. Switch
this disk with the one in your briefcase,

57:07.036 --> 57:11.582
before you go to the
vault. Take off your ring.

57:11.790 --> 57:16.003
- What?
- Your ring.

57:21.550 --> 57:27.097
This is a tracking device. We'll know
your precise location at all times.

57:30.059 --> 57:33.103
Does this mean we can
see each other again?

57:33.312 --> 57:36.106
I pick you up after you leave
the vault, deliver you to Rooks.

57:36.315 --> 57:41.612
- I mean, after that?
- We can never see each other again.

57:41.820 --> 57:46.492
It would compromise your identity.

57:53.624 --> 57:57.795
I'm never getting out of this, am I?

59:21.295 --> 59:24.631
500 Horse Creek Road, please.

59:24.840 --> 59:27.718
I know where to go.

59:30.220 --> 59:35.517
Settle down, Mr. Sullivan. We
have a long ride ahead of us.

59:55.788 --> 59:59.541
You don't have to pretend to be Thursby.

59:59.750 --> 01:00:02.878
I know you're not brainwashed.

01:00:03.087 --> 01:00:08.300
I know that Sunways has been using
you as a double agent against Digicorp.

01:00:11.053 --> 01:00:13.806
Are you going to kill me?

01:00:14.014 --> 01:00:17.267
Not if you turn your loyalties to me

01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:22.981
instead of Sebastian Rooks. Oh,
yeah. I know that you work for him.

01:00:24.191 --> 01:00:30.823
As a matter of fact, we both do.
I'm Rooks' inside source at Digicorp.

01:00:32.116 --> 01:00:36.161
- His what?
- He paid me to hire you

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:41.959
so you could be his pawn once
you were sent off to Sunways.

01:00:42.876 --> 01:00:46.422
You didn't think I hired you because
I was impressed by you, did you?

01:00:50.134 --> 01:00:52.761
It's a good plan, really.

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:56.932
Rooks knew that you'd end up here in
Kansas on the way to the Sunways vault.

01:00:57.141 --> 01:01:00.477
He knew he could convince you
to switch their disk with his.

01:01:00.686 --> 01:01:05.357
- That was his scheme from the very start.
- It's not possible.

01:01:05.566 --> 01:01:09.653
Rooks' disk contains a search program.

01:01:09.862 --> 01:01:12.823
It penetrates the vault's secure network

01:01:12.948 --> 01:01:16.660
and quietly steal a data file
without triggering any alarms.

01:01:16.952 --> 01:01:19.371
What data file?

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.876
Who knows? But if Rooks has gone
through all this trouble to get it,

01:01:24.084 --> 01:01:27.087
it must be extremely valuable.

01:01:27.796 --> 01:01:30.674
The plan was foolproof.

01:01:30.883 --> 01:01:34.887
Except for one factor
he failed to consider:

01:01:35.095 --> 01:01:37.431
me.

01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:39.058
What do you want?

01:01:39.058 --> 01:01:42.728
When you come out of the vault,
deliver the disk to me, not Rooks.

01:01:42.728 --> 01:01:44.772
I've been loyal to Digicorp all along.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.233
Why should I trust you or Digicorp?

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:51.695
Because we'll let you live and
Rooks won't. It's as simple as that.

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:55.908
No one sees his face and
lives to tell about it.

01:01:56.116 --> 01:01:57.701
No one sees his face?

01:01:57.701 --> 01:02:00.829
He's a deep cover operative.
A Yuri in cyberspace.

01:02:00.913 --> 01:02:05.709
He's a phantom. Companies hire him
without actually knowing who he is.

01:02:05.918 --> 01:02:08.837
If they did, they'd kill him.

01:02:09.046 --> 01:02:15.260
The moment you give that disk to
Rooks is the moment he eliminates you.

01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:21.767
There's only one person Rooks
trusts with his identity:

01:02:21.975 --> 01:02:26.480
Rita Foster, his lover.

01:02:28.524 --> 01:02:32.736
She's completely loyal
to him. No one else.

01:02:33.862 --> 01:02:38.283
I'm the only person you can trust now.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.668
I'll be nearby when you come out.

01:02:47.876 --> 01:02:52.923
Just in case we get separated.

01:02:55.676 --> 01:02:58.345
No charge for the ride.

01:04:32.398 --> 01:04:35.859
Good evening, Mr. Thursby.

01:04:45.744 --> 01:04:48.455
My name's Virgil Dunn.

01:04:49.748 --> 01:04:52.751
Welcome to the vault.

01:05:12.229 --> 01:05:13.647
Your first time?

01:05:15.774 --> 01:05:19.737
Hope you didn't have a big dinner.

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:46.805
Step ahead, please.

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:18.128
Now that we know you are bug free,

01:06:18.337 --> 01:06:22.091
I can call you by
your real name, Morgan.

01:06:24.927 --> 01:06:28.389
Dunn, Virgil C.

01:07:42.171 --> 01:07:45.883
I need your disk now, please.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:55.184
Good, good.

01:08:33.305 --> 01:08:36.725
Digicorp will cream in their pants

01:08:36.934 --> 01:08:39.520
when they copy the bogus data
that I just cooked up for them.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:42.523
You wouldn't believe
the number of times

01:08:42.731 --> 01:08:45.234
they tried to jack
into the systems down here.

01:08:45.984 --> 01:08:48.569
- Have they ever succeeded?
- Hell, no.

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:54.910
This place is tighter
than a nun's asshole.

01:09:05.295 --> 01:09:09.091
Uh, snort while we wait?

01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:11.176
Sure.

01:09:11.385 --> 01:09:16.098
I distilled it myself down here. One
of my little hobbies to pass the time.

01:09:26.442 --> 01:09:30.738
- Thanks.
- Here's to the information agent.

01:09:40.997 --> 01:09:43.667
I used to be an agent like you once.

01:09:43.876 --> 01:09:47.046
I was the best mole
spotter in the business.

01:09:47.254 --> 01:09:49.631
You put me in a room with
a possible double agent,

01:09:50.131 --> 01:09:51.925
let me ask him a couple of questions,

01:09:52.134 --> 01:09:55.387
and I could tell you right there
whether he was a spy or not.

01:09:56.013 --> 01:10:01.101
That was before Sunways sent me
down here. That was three years ago.

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:05.481
- What happened?
- Those fucking machines is what happened.

01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:10.611
They said the neuro-graphs were
100% accurate, but I wasn't.

01:10:10.819 --> 01:10:16.241
That a really good spy, a really
good liar, could trick me every time.

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:20.037
It's bullshit, I told them.

01:10:20.245 --> 01:10:22.664
But they wouldn't listen.

01:10:22.873 --> 01:10:30.798
You see, there are things that only a person
can know about another person, Mr. Sullivan,

01:10:31.006 --> 01:10:34.343
things that a machine
could never pick up.

01:10:34.551 --> 01:10:37.846
For example, let me ask you
a couple of questions.

01:10:38.055 --> 01:10:39.223
Excuse me?

01:10:39.431 --> 01:10:44.395
What is your favorite drink? Go ahead.
Answer. I just want to prove my point.

01:10:44.687 --> 01:10:48.232
What is your favorite drink?

01:10:51.402 --> 01:10:55.155
Er, scotch, single malt, on the rocks.

01:10:56.156 --> 01:10:59.368
You're telling the truth.

01:10:59.576 --> 01:11:03.080
- Are you married?
- Yes, I am.

01:11:04.289 --> 01:11:09.670
Truth again. See, you're very
- very easy to read.

01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:16.051
Now
- Are you in love with your wife?

01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:28.647
- Yes.
- There, you just lied. Am I right?

01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:36.739
Yes, I lied.

01:11:43.662 --> 01:11:46.623
It's more than just questions, however.

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:55.674
For instance, I'm sensing
a kind of tension in you.

01:11:58.594 --> 01:12:03.807
It's been evident ever since
I put your disk in my computer.

01:12:04.016 --> 01:12:08.687
Now why would that be? We both
know the disk is from Sunways.

01:12:09.938 --> 01:12:13.776
That's nothing that
should make you uneasy.

01:12:19.073 --> 01:12:24.203
- One last question, all right?
- Sure.

01:12:25.913 --> 01:12:29.500
Are you a double agent?

01:13:12.376 --> 01:13:15.421
Where's Mr. Dunn?

01:13:16.755 --> 01:13:19.508
He decided to stay in his office.

01:13:21.677 --> 01:13:26.056
- Right. You can go ahead, Mr. Sullivan.
- Thank you.

01:13:42.865 --> 01:13:44.950
Open the door!

01:14:21.987 --> 01:14:24.615
Emergency crews are on their way.

01:14:24.823 --> 01:14:28.911
For your safety, please
remain inside the elevator.

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:38.879
For your safety, please
remain inside the elevator.

01:14:40.255 --> 01:14:43.175
Emergency crews are on their way.

01:14:43.384 --> 01:14:48.472
For your safety, please
remain inside the elevator.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.833
Jump!

01:16:03.839 --> 01:16:07.509
Now!

01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:30.074
I told you I'd know where you'd be.

01:16:30.282 --> 01:16:33.243
- Is this Rooks?
- I can take the disk now.

01:16:33.452 --> 01:16:38.665
Jamison, one of our operatives.
Rooks is back at the hotel.

01:16:38.874 --> 01:16:42.336
He's looking forward to seeing you.

01:17:26.922 --> 01:17:31.260
The car's waiting downstairs.
Call me when you get to the lab.

01:17:33.429 --> 01:17:39.143
- This is where Rooks lives?
- For now. He moves around a lot.

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:45.149
- But you know where he is at all times?
- We have a special relationship.

01:17:48.569 --> 01:17:52.781
Your assignment is nearly
finished, Mr. Sullivan.

01:18:15.095 --> 01:18:18.766
I'll be back in a moment.

01:18:50.798 --> 01:18:53.092
Finster.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.429
- It's Morgan Sullivan.
- Sullivan! What happened to you?

01:18:57.638 --> 01:19:01.058
I'm in the penthouse suite of an old
building. I don't know where it is.

01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:04.228
We're tracing the call. We'll
be there shortly. Where's Rooks?

01:19:04.436 --> 01:19:07.981
- I'm just about to meet him.
- Get off the phone before he sees you.

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:13.821
He will kill you, understand? Hold
on to the disk. We're on our way.

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:26.417
- Don't come any closer.
- Put the gun down, Mr. Sullivan.

01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:31.005
I'll break it. You come
any further, I'll break it.

01:19:31.213 --> 01:19:36.969
I gave you the Sunways disk. This
one is yours. The one Rooks wants.

01:19:42.099 --> 01:19:44.143
Stop!

01:19:44.435 --> 01:19:50.232
- You really don't want to do that.
- You used me. You and Rooks.

01:19:51.316 --> 01:19:54.903
- You used me from the very start.
- Wait, let me explain.

01:19:55.112 --> 01:19:57.781
No. Finster already
explained everything.

01:19:57.990 --> 01:20:01.660
- When did you talk to Finster?
- He's on his way. I just called him.

01:20:01.869 --> 01:20:04.455
If Rooks wants this disk
before Finster arrives,

01:20:04.455 --> 01:20:06.498
you better unlock that
door and let me go.

01:20:07.458 --> 01:20:12.921
Listen to me. Sebastian Rooks is
not the person you think he is.

01:20:14.006 --> 01:20:16.508
Sebastian Rooks is a ruthless spy

01:20:16.717 --> 01:20:18.469
- and so are you.
- No, you're wrong. He's-

01:20:18.677 --> 01:20:21.013
I know about you.

01:20:21.221 --> 01:20:26.060
I know about the two of you. I know
about your special relationship.

01:20:26.268 --> 01:20:27.394
Please, just hear me out. I-

01:20:27.603 --> 01:20:31.273
I don't want to hear any more lies!
I don't want to hear any more lies!

01:20:34.902 --> 01:20:41.116
God! I can't believe I thought
you actually cared about me.

01:20:44.078 --> 01:20:48.457
- I can't believe I was such a fool.
- I do care about you.

01:20:57.091 --> 01:20:59.468
No, no.

01:21:00.678 --> 01:21:06.100
Just go see Rooks. It'll be okay.

01:21:14.274 --> 01:21:18.404
Hurry. Find him.

01:23:31.995 --> 01:23:37.543
I tried stopping you, but you insisted.

01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:42.589
You said it was the only way to
steal the data from the vault.

01:23:42.798 --> 01:23:46.760
Welcome home, Mr. Rooks.

01:23:56.020 --> 01:24:00.482
Come on. Finster will
be here any minute.

01:24:00.691 --> 01:24:05.654
No, no. No more lies. You
can't trick me anymore.

01:24:05.863 --> 01:24:09.616
Listen to me. You are
not Morgan Sullivan.

01:24:09.825 --> 01:24:13.328
You created him out of
your own imagination.

01:24:14.163 --> 01:24:17.291
Your life in the suburbs, your
miserable marriage-- Your wife, Amy,

01:24:17.499 --> 01:24:19.126
was one of your own
operatives playing a part

01:24:19.168 --> 01:24:21.754
you assigned her.

01:24:21.962 --> 01:24:25.632
The more you fight the
truth, the more it'll hurt.

01:24:27.843 --> 01:24:29.303
It's not possible.

01:24:29.303 --> 01:24:32.139
You used the same brainwashing
technique Digicorp uses.

01:24:32.348 --> 01:24:35.100
You were the one who sold them
the technology to begin with.

01:24:35.309 --> 01:24:37.728
- This makes no sense!
- It makes perfect sense!

01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.439
By turning yourself into Morgan Sullivan

01:24:40.647 --> 01:24:43.317
was the only way you could pass
Digicorp's neuro-graph.

01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:47.112
It was the only way you could get hired
to be their spy and get sent to Sunways.

01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:50.532
- Why would anyone do this?
- For this.

01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:54.620
- What's on it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

01:24:55.621 --> 01:24:56.872
You don't know?

01:24:57.081 --> 01:25:00.417
I've put a lot of faith
into this assignment.

01:25:09.468 --> 01:25:11.804
Clear! Freeze! Don't move!

01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:25.567
Sunways Security! Identify
yourself! Digicorp Security!

01:25:39.123 --> 01:25:42.376
- You're following me, Callaway?
- I'm here for Rooks, not you.

01:25:42.584 --> 01:25:46.005
That's who I am here for.

01:25:53.971 --> 01:25:58.600
- You've flown this before?
- No, never.

01:25:58.809 --> 01:26:03.981
You know how to fly it. You designed it.

01:26:12.823 --> 01:26:15.409
- I don't know what to do.
- Sebastian Rooks knows.

01:26:15.617 --> 01:26:20.497
- I can't remember Sebastian Rooks!
- You remembered that you loved me.

01:26:27.463 --> 01:26:30.632
Just think.

01:27:26.105 --> 01:27:30.067
We're out.

01:27:37.783 --> 01:27:42.037
Did you get a look at him?
Did you see Rooks' face?

01:27:42.246 --> 01:27:44.415
Just Morgan Sullivan, our pawn.

01:27:57.553 --> 01:28:01.473
Jesus! He's Rooks.

01:29:48.372 --> 01:29:51.291
Is it what you want?

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.253
Yes.

01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:02.553
Yes. It's you.

01:30:11.145 --> 01:30:16.358
The file in the vault was
erased. And this is the only copy.

01:30:26.827 --> 01:30:29.913
Now there's no copy at all.
