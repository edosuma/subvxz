[♪♪♪]

00:27.777 --> 00:30.697
This place is fabulous, huh?

00:30.697 --> 00:31.990
Now, I guarantee you,

00:31.990 --> 00:35.285
nowhere else in Phoenix will
you get a view like that.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.746
Now, personally,

00:37.746 --> 00:40.373
I love the city lights
at night, right?

00:40.373 --> 00:42.083
Spectacular.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.670
Why don't you all
take a look around,

00:45.670 --> 00:47.839
ask me any questions
if you've got any, okay?

00:47.839 --> 00:50.300
Oh, and don't forget
about the cold pantry.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.177
Perfect for entertaining
this time of year.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.265
Hey, great turnout.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.558
I think so.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.768
And your set decorating,

00:59.768 --> 01:01.770
with this whole holiday theme
you've got going on,

01:01.770 --> 01:03.104
very, very smart.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.397
Well, thank you.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.107
I mean, it is three weeks
until Christmas,

01:06.107 --> 01:07.442
and we both know

01:07.442 --> 01:09.402
nothing gets people
in the buying mood

01:09.402 --> 01:10.403
like the holidays.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.448
And on that note,
I have a buyer for you.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.450
That couple over there
in the kitchen.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.827
I sold them a country home
last year,

01:17.827 --> 01:19.579
and now she's going
a little squirrely.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.955
Misses her lunch dates
in the city.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.124
This place is exactly
what they're looking for.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.209
Hmm.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.920
And I am sure that I can
even get you over asking.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.880
Ooh, Nate!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.632
Is that your early
Christmas gift to me?

01:30.632 --> 01:31.800
[chuckles] No.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.844
But I do have an idea
of something that might be.

01:34.844 --> 01:35.970
Oh!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.430
What do you say
you and I have lunch tomorrow?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.723
Sure.

01:39.849 --> 01:40.850
Oh, there it is...

01:40.850 --> 01:42.435
Wait for it...

01:43.478 --> 01:44.813
She just found the cold pantry.

01:44.813 --> 01:45.814
[chuckling]

01:45.814 --> 01:47.315
That's a deal-sealer.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.656
You know, I could have

01:54.656 --> 01:55.824
treated you to something
a little fancier than this.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.326
I know.
I don't need fancy.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.245
Just need napkins and...

02:01.830 --> 02:04.833
So, tell me,

02:04.833 --> 02:06.459
are you happy over at Bimark?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.920
'Cause I know that
you land a lot of clients

02:09.920 --> 02:11.047
that you have to hand over

02:11.047 --> 02:12.340
to other realtors
in that office.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.133
Yeah, but...

02:14.133 --> 02:16.845
they have a lot of offices
all over the country,

02:16.845 --> 02:18.930
and everybody knows their name.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.559
No, see, everybody
knows your name, Emma.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.935
You know why?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.687
'Cause you're Em-azing.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.397
It's true.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.859
Look, what if all the clients
that you land, you get to keep?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.694
Think about it.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.696
People want you
to buy and sell their homes--

02:34.696 --> 02:36.197
not Bimark.

02:36.197 --> 02:39.826
So, what do you think

02:39.826 --> 02:42.537
about you and me setting up
our own real-estate banner?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.372
As independents?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.374
-Yeah. Don't make it
sound so scary.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.167
Trust me.
The freedom is liberating.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.878
Nate, wow.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.504
Um...

02:51.504 --> 02:52.714
I mean...

02:52.714 --> 02:55.592
I have had a...

02:55.592 --> 02:57.051
I have had
a chapter in my life

02:57.051 --> 02:59.679
come to a close this year, so...

02:59.679 --> 03:00.722
maybe it's time for a new one?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.056
That is what I'm talking about.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.391
Put it there, partner.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.934
Oh, wait a minute.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.228
Oh, Em', it's going to be
such a great year.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.563
But listen,

03:08.563 --> 03:10.398
before we can, you know,
make this work,

03:10.398 --> 03:11.608
you're going to have to offload

03:11.608 --> 03:12.609
any of the houses

03:12.609 --> 03:13.735
that you've still
got listed with Bimark.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.111
Of course.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.489
And I've only got one,
and I'm already on it.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.033
That's my girl.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.076
Oh, and I have got to get
to a showing.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.077
I'll tell you what,

03:23.077 --> 03:24.412
I'll send over
the paperwork next week?

03:24.412 --> 03:26.247
Sounds good.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.248
Partner.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.499
I like the sound of that!

03:31.794 --> 03:36.132
[♪♪♪]

03:49.479 --> 03:50.980
Hey, Heather.
How's it going?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.732
<i>Well, we're not
snowed in yet,</i>

03:52.732 --> 03:53.983
<i>so that's great.</i>

03:53.983 --> 03:56.402
Except everything
looks prettier in the snow,

03:56.402 --> 03:57.987
including our listing, right?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.739
<i>It sure does,</i>

03:59.739 --> 04:00.907
<i>but...</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:02.408
<i>we haven't had any offers yet.</i>

04:02.408 --> 04:05.787
Well, Christmas time
in Cherry Creek

04:05.787 --> 04:07.413
is the best time of the year.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.706
I know the offers
will be pouring in.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.794
<i>Yeah, not so much.</i>

04:12.794 --> 04:15.171
Or not.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.798
It sounds like you could use
a helping hand.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.635
I can leave tonight.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.095
<i>-Okay?
</i>-I'll see you in the morning.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.388
<i>-Thanks.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.778
Hello?

05:23.197 --> 05:25.533
There you are.
Welcome home!

05:25.533 --> 05:26.659
Thank you.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.702
-How does it feel to be back?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.078
Uh...

05:29.078 --> 05:30.872
A little strange.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.041
Everything looks
the same, but...

05:34.584 --> 05:36.085
I know.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.713
I went through the same thing
when my father passed.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.173
I had to sell our family home.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.052
I hope you don't mind,
I decluttered a bit.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.888
You know, for staging.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.890
Of course. Yes.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.391
And you've been
outstanding, Heather,

05:50.391 --> 05:51.559
with the listing.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.560
Thank you.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.604
Hey, we are all Bimark.
One big family.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.316
I just wish
I had an offer for you,

05:58.316 --> 06:01.235
but things have been
really slow around here.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.029
Not in the listings department.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.489
Lord knows, I have put
more houses on the market

06:04.489 --> 06:06.074
than I can count.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.075
But no one's buying.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.577
Well, we just need
to show people

06:09.577 --> 06:12.663
how great it would be
to live here,

06:12.663 --> 06:14.290
and let them create
their own memories.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.834
Especially at Christmas.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.424
Where are you going?

06:25.009 --> 06:26.719
To create
those Christmas memories.

06:32.683 --> 06:36.938
[♪♪♪]

06:39.398 --> 06:40.900
[Emma] One store?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.860
Where are the rest
of the decorations?

06:45.488 --> 06:49.075
[♪♪♪]

06:52.453 --> 06:53.454
I'll be there in a minute!

06:57.792 --> 06:58.793
How can I help you?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.504
-Emma! Oh, my gosh!
-Lily!

07:04.382 --> 07:05.967
-What are you doing here?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.927
Oh, let me guess.
The house?

07:09.512 --> 07:10.638
Yeah,

07:10.638 --> 07:11.722
which I thought,

07:11.722 --> 07:13.474
the way Cherry Creek
does it up at Christmas,

07:13.474 --> 07:14.600
would have sold itself by now.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.562
But what in the world
is all this nothingness?

07:17.562 --> 07:20.314
Cherry Creek is usually
glowing this time of year.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.482
It used to,

07:21.482 --> 07:24.277
but you know tough it's been
the past few years

07:24.277 --> 07:26.154
with all the other
Christmas light competitors,

07:26.154 --> 07:28.489
and your dad having to make
cutbacks at the factory.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.490
Cutbacks?

07:29.490 --> 07:30.491
-Yeah.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.285
He had to let go
of half the workers.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.997
He must have told you.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.081
Mm-hmm.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.002
I haven't been here
the last few Christmases, so...

07:42.128 --> 07:43.337
A lot of people left,

07:43.337 --> 07:45.298
and now with your dad gone,
I mean...

07:45.298 --> 07:46.465
It was like he was

07:46.465 --> 07:48.050
Cherry Creek's
unofficial sheriff.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.053
It's just not the same.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.096
I know.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.932
But I am glad to see you.
You look great.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.100
You too.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.185
How long are you here for?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.978
Oh, just until the house sells,

07:58.978 --> 08:02.565
which is also in need
of some serious Christmas.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.358
Well, I hope
it doesn't sell too fast

08:04.358 --> 08:05.610
'cause you and I have
some catching up to do.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.652
But first things first,

08:06.652 --> 08:07.862
let's get you set up

08:07.862 --> 08:09.780
so it looks like Christmas
exploded in your house.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.781
[makes exploding sound]

08:13.034 --> 08:14.202
In a good way.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.370
Not like that time
I left the candle on overnight.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.542
I just wanted something
different, you know?

08:28.382 --> 08:30.551
Lily, thanks so much.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.260
No problem.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.386
Are you going straight home?

08:33.386 --> 08:36.682
No, I thought
I'd stop by the factory.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.683
It's been a while.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.059
How about tomorrow?
You and me?

08:39.059 --> 08:40.394
Yes.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.188
I was actually going to drop off
food donations at the rink.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.898
We can hang out like old times.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.733
The rink, oh...

08:46.859 --> 08:49.028
Is that hot chocolate machine
still there?

08:49.028 --> 08:50.238
Of course.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.405
Nothing ever changes
at Charlotte's.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.823
It's a date then, my friend.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.033
Perfect.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.243
Just like old times.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.704
Just like old times,
my friend.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.414
Yeah, just put that right--

09:00.414 --> 09:02.041
What, what, what--
seriously?

09:02.041 --> 09:03.251
Really?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.418
Drive safe.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.128
Yeah, with this around my neck.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.483
Hi, Ben.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.819
Such an unexpected surprise.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.488
How long have you been in town?

10:14.488 --> 10:17.074
Long enough to know
you still work late.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.828
Yeah, well,

10:20.828 --> 10:22.663
someone's got to pull
their weight around here now.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.625
You're the new sheriff
around here.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.211
You could probably
give yourself a little break.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.132
Is that an official directive
from an official Simmons?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.342
[laughs]

10:34.342 --> 10:35.426
Mm-mm.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.886
I would never pull rank

10:36.886 --> 10:39.055
just because my family's name
is on the building.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.144
But I am kind of hungry.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.520
-Good, cause I haven't had
dinner yet either.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.521
You can let me know

10:47.521 --> 10:49.398
what you're doing back here
in Cherry Creek?

10:51.317 --> 10:53.986
'Cause, I mean,
the last time you were here...

10:55.029 --> 10:56.781
I would love one of

10:56.781 --> 10:59.367
those meatloaf sandwiches
from Mr. Porter's.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.660
Is he still open?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.123
The day Mr. Porter closes...

11:08.542 --> 11:10.086
is the day I'm outta here, too.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.465
After you.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.722
Thank you.

Oh, yes...

11:25.059 --> 11:28.062
Oh, I can smell
the nutmeg in the gravy.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.441
That could be the only thing
that hasn't changed around here.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.027
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that,

11:35.027 --> 11:36.404
because, apparently,

11:36.404 --> 11:37.530
my dad didn't tell me

11:37.530 --> 11:39.782
that the factory
is having trouble.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.243
Emma, your dad knew
your heart wasn't really in it,

11:42.243 --> 11:44.578
and he didn't want to take away
from what you were doing.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.580
I guess that explains

11:46.580 --> 11:49.417
why he insisted on
coming down to see me

11:49.417 --> 11:50.584
for the last few holidays.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.170
But, come on, Ben,
still, he should have told me.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.048
I'm the last surviving Simmons,

11:56.048 --> 11:58.384
even if I'm not
working in the factory

11:58.384 --> 12:00.553
making lights
or managing the company.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.599
So who's the competitor
taking our business?

12:05.599 --> 12:06.851
Thompson's.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.522
Yeah, they just opened a factory
about 50 miles from here.

12:12.940 --> 12:13.941
Pete Thompson.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.277
He's got deep pockets,

12:16.277 --> 12:17.278
they started
churning over lights

12:17.278 --> 12:18.404
like nobody's business.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.656
We couldn't keep up.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.701
Yeah, well, that's because
we pride ourselves on quality,

12:23.701 --> 12:26.245
and after 100 years,
that's not changing.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.039
We?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.209
Now who sounds like the sheriff?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.669
[laughs]

12:33.669 --> 12:34.879
Oh, no.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.172
Not to worry.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.424
I am not going
to be stepping into those shoes.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.093
I'm just here to sell the house.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.972
I see.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.892
So things are going good
in Phoenix?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.644
-[text alert chimes]
-Things are going great.

12:50.644 --> 12:54.732
Nate and I have decided
to go to the next level

12:54.732 --> 12:57.526
and create our own
realtor banner together.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.154
That's--
that's great.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.655
That's great.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.491
I'm happy things
are going good for you.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.493
Thanks.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.663
I really wish I could say
the same about Cherry Creek.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.334
Yeah, well,

13:13.334 --> 13:14.335
if some people want to leave,

13:14.335 --> 13:16.086
I guess there's not really
much you can do.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.137
[laughing]

13:27.848 --> 13:29.391
Oh, it's so pretty.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.477
Yeah.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.853
Hey, can we sit down
for a minute?

13:32.853 --> 13:34.688
Yeah, sure.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.114
Now, it's pretty, but...

13:44.114 --> 13:45.533
I'm hoping that

13:45.533 --> 13:48.410
that snowstorm Megan
that everybody's talking about,

13:48.410 --> 13:49.870
that it holds off

13:49.870 --> 13:51.372
until I get back
from Briars tomorrow.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.500
You getting a tree?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.543
Mm-hmm.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.879
Well, you know,
to warm up the house a bit,

13:58.879 --> 14:00.965
and make it feel festive
for prospective buyers.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.592
I hope you got snow tires.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.346
I forgot.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.139
[groans]

14:09.139 --> 14:10.891
-Yeah...
-You're gonna need those.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.810
All right,
I'll figure something out.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.897
I mean, if you want, I could--
I could take you out there.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.399
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.441
Okay.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.860
-Thanks.
-Okay.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.861
First thing in the morning?

14:22.861 --> 14:24.280
-I'll be ready.
-All right.

14:28.075 --> 14:33.914
[♪♪♪]

14:33.914 --> 14:35.249
[knocking on door]

14:35.249 --> 14:36.834
[doorbell rings]

14:38.043 --> 14:39.587
[knocking on door]

14:40.588 --> 14:41.714
[Ben] Hello?

14:43.799 --> 14:45.551
[Emma] One second.
I'm coming.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.805
[Ben] The tree farm awaits.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.059
You have a key?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.062
Yeah. Sorry.
I hope you don't mind.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.439
Your dad gave me one

14:58.439 --> 14:59.940
so I could keep
an eye on him and things

14:59.940 --> 15:01.525
'cause he was getting
older, and...

15:02.735 --> 15:03.944
Did I just wake you?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.035
You still look cute
in that onesie.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.957
Why are you early, Benjamin?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.751
You ain't never
early for nothing.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.294
Why are you early?

15:21.629 --> 15:23.464
Butterflies, butterflies...

15:23.464 --> 15:25.007
Wow...

15:27.009 --> 15:28.594
You've done
a great job here, Em'.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.682
The house looks just like
it used to at Christmas.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.976
Thank you, Benjamin.

15:35.976 --> 15:39.021
I've had lots of experience
decorating it.

15:40.981 --> 15:41.982
[Ben] Wow...

15:41.982 --> 15:44.902
I still remember these...

15:44.902 --> 15:46.820
these decorations
from high school.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.575
Ah... better.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.829
This is for you.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.955
Oh, thanks.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.000
And...

16:00.000 --> 16:01.627
maple syrup.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.588
You remembered.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.091
Emma, you used to carry around
a bottle of that in your bag.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.301
I don't know how many times
I had to explain

16:09.301 --> 16:10.844
it was just syrup,

16:10.844 --> 16:11.845
and that my girlfriend
wasn't trying

16:11.845 --> 16:13.847
to give her coffee
a little extra kick?

16:13.847 --> 16:15.349
Well...

16:15.349 --> 16:17.142
I like what I like,

16:17.142 --> 16:19.687
and I will not compromise.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.021
All right, top it up,

16:21.021 --> 16:22.523
and then we should get going
so you can finish decorating.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.691
All right. Cool.

16:23.691 --> 16:24.858
Hey, listen, on the way,
do you mind if we stop and--

16:24.858 --> 16:25.818
[Ben clears his throat]

16:25.818 --> 16:26.819
Carrot.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.238
No raisins.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.370
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.373
Shall we?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.874
All right, let's do this.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.961
I'm gonna wear
Dad's stuff today.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.383
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.515
Your mom would always
give your dad heck.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.516
Oh, true.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.309
But we'd always find a way

16:59.309 --> 17:01.186
to get it
through the front door.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.354
How are your parents?

17:02.354 --> 17:03.772
Great.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.482
Yeah...

17:05.482 --> 17:07.067
Dad's still working
in the shipping yard

17:07.067 --> 17:09.153
and Mom's still
bugging him to retire.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.740
So, no plans to leave, huh?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.324
No. Never.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.368
How about this one?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.748
What do you think?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.415
-It's a little small.
-Yeah?

17:22.415 --> 17:23.416
Go a bit bigger?

17:23.416 --> 17:24.585
[together]
"Go big or go home."

17:27.253 --> 17:28.380
Okay...

17:30.758 --> 17:32.050
-Perfection.
-Perfection?

17:32.050 --> 17:33.552
-Perfection, man!
-All right. That's the one.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.803
Hey, Mom, look at this one!

17:35.721 --> 17:36.847
Looks good, Liam!

17:39.099 --> 17:40.309
Hey!

17:40.309 --> 17:41.268
Hey, you two.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.519
Good, good.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.562
Liam? No way!

17:43.562 --> 17:44.772
Look at him!

17:44.772 --> 17:47.107
I know, hey?

17:47.107 --> 17:47.983
Blowing' through town, are ya?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.067
Yeah.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.944
Just, you know,
here until the house sells.

17:50.944 --> 17:51.945
Well, then the four of us

17:51.945 --> 17:52.946
need to get together
while you're here.

17:52.946 --> 17:53.947
We can get a sitter

17:53.947 --> 17:55.282
and hit the town
like we used to.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.325
Or the rink.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.951
Hey, good times, right?

17:57.951 --> 17:59.411
Sounds great.

18:00.662 --> 18:01.955
Sounds-- Uh-oh! Incoming!

18:04.082 --> 18:05.042
Gotcha, Dad!

18:06.627 --> 18:07.628
You better run, my boy!

18:09.296 --> 18:10.339
He's gonna need some back-up.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.423
-Do it.

18:12.883 --> 18:13.926
Look at them.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.470
Seems like yesterday
we were just kids,

18:16.470 --> 18:18.639
running around
with snowflakes in our eyes,

18:18.639 --> 18:19.932
without a care in the world.

18:19.932 --> 18:20.933
Mm-hmm.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.602
Well, I'm going
to round the boys up.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.478
I'm going to see you tonight?

18:24.478 --> 18:25.604
Yeah, can't wait.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.731
And we're going
to figure it out.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.149
The four of us.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.485
All right, kids!

18:31.485 --> 18:32.736
Cease fire!

18:35.239 --> 18:36.281
Oh, excuse me.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.449
We'd like to get
this one here, please.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.450
Yeah.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.666
[♪♪♪]

18:45.666 --> 18:47.835
Well, it's not
the biggest tree,

18:47.835 --> 18:49.294
but it's not
the smallest one either.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.504
-Perfect.
-Yeah.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.005
Guess you need a hand
getting it in the house?

18:52.005 --> 18:53.215
-If you don't mind.
-Of course not.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.424
Okay.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.968
First, we've got to get it
through the front door.

18:55.968 --> 18:56.927
[man] Hello?

18:56.927 --> 18:57.928
Hello?

18:57.928 --> 18:58.929
That's a beauty.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.100
Dusty! Hi!

19:04.184 --> 19:05.227
It's so good to see you.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.854
I've been meaning to come over
and say hello.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.021
It's sure nice to see

19:08.021 --> 19:10.732
your smiling face
back in the neighborhood.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.859
It's...

19:11.859 --> 19:14.778
Well, it's been, you know,
a bit quiet around here.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.864
I heard.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.282
Holy doodle.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.535
Is that yet another
familiar face I see before me?

19:21.535 --> 19:22.536
How are you doing, Dusty?

19:23.787 --> 19:24.955
Better than good.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.417
The last time I saw
you two guys together was...

19:29.710 --> 19:30.836
well, I don't know,

19:30.836 --> 19:32.838
but it was sure a long time.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.256
Well, Ben is just coming by

19:34.256 --> 19:36.633
to help me get the tree
in the stand, and...

19:36.633 --> 19:39.219
I thought I'd get the place all,
you know, Christmassy

19:39.219 --> 19:41.013
for potential buyers.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.681
Yeah, well,

19:42.681 --> 19:44.266
don't make it
too homey in there,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.018
or you may
find yourself staying.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.563
I don't know about that.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.856
[Dusty] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:52.232 --> 19:54.401
When Eleanor
heard you were here,

19:54.401 --> 19:56.236
she told me
I had to give these to you.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.031
She knows
that you love fruitcake.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.658
Oh! The fruitcake.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.202
Ben, I can get you a box, too.

20:04.202 --> 20:07.372
Oh, no, Dusty, I'm--
I'm good, man.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.082
I'm good. I got--
I got a--

20:09.082 --> 20:10.083
-We'll share...
-We'll share.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.919
You two!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.795
You always did make a good pair.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.090
-Toodle-oo!
-Good to see you, Dusty.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.383
[Dusty] Okay.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.135
[Ben] All right, I got this.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.053
[Emma] You sure?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.095
[Ben] Yeah.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.263
[Emma] I can help you carry it.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.015
[Ben] That fruitcake's
probably heavier.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.141
[laughs]

20:27.100 --> 20:29.102
You know, my dad had
this whole ritual

20:29.102 --> 20:31.730
every single time
that we got our tree.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.107
First, we had to start
with the hot chocolate.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.943
Right, boom.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.070
And then he would
start playing carols,

20:38.070 --> 20:40.572
and he would always
start with...

20:40.572 --> 20:42.240
[together] "Deck the Halls."

20:43.742 --> 20:46.620
And then he would
get the lights,

20:46.620 --> 20:50.499
and as he would string
said lights around the tree,

20:50.499 --> 20:51.833
he would begin to tell me

20:51.833 --> 20:52.960
the famous story

20:52.960 --> 20:55.754
of how his grandfather
got sick as a little boy.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.964
Mm-hmm.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.424
-And his dad,
my great-grandfather--

20:59.424 --> 21:00.717
[together] Roy.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.094
--would dip light bulbs--

21:02.094 --> 21:04.137
[together]
In red and green paint.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.265
And he would hang
those light bulbs

21:07.265 --> 21:10.143
in the tree
outside of his window

21:10.143 --> 21:11.353
to lift his spirits.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.648
And that's how the idea
of Christmas lights came to be.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.650
And that is how--

21:16.650 --> 21:18.527
[together]
Simmons Lights came to be.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.989
You know, I'm still surprised

21:21.989 --> 21:23.907
that you... you know,

21:23.907 --> 21:25.283
never followed up
in the family business.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.162
Well...

21:29.162 --> 21:30.914
I guess lights
just isn't my thing.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.375
You know, I really hope

21:33.375 --> 21:35.711
that all these ornaments
have hooks on them.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.715
What is... what is...

21:39.715 --> 21:40.716
what is this?

21:40.716 --> 21:42.509
-What you got?
-[Emma shrieks]

21:42.509 --> 21:43.510
Geez.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.471
What is this?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.016
[Emma] I'm sorry.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.142
I found that

21:50.142 --> 21:51.309
when I was getting

21:51.309 --> 21:52.936
the Christmas stuff
out of the attic.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.813
It's a Christmas present
that I made for Daddy one year

21:54.813 --> 21:55.856
when I was little.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.024
It was from a stuffed animal.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.359
How do I look?

21:59.359 --> 22:01.194
Excuse me, but the tail
goes in the back.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.697
-The tail goes in the back.
-Oh, in the back?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.365
-Yes.
-Okay. All right.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.534
[Ben] Just a little switcharoo.
There we go.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.452
[Emma] Yeah, switch it around.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.579
I hope that's not real.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.248
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.249
We didn't hear you come in.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.500
Yeah.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.210
Sorry, I guess
I should have knocked.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.463
I'm just not used
to anyone being here.

22:20.672 --> 22:21.631
It's fake.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.844
Well, the house looks nice.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.888
Definitely homey.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.016
Well, I always find that...

22:31.016 --> 22:32.809
staging makes
all the difference.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.814
That, and accepting
lower offers.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.318
I think it might be time, Emma.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.738
Yeah, I mean...

22:44.738 --> 22:45.739
you're here,

22:45.739 --> 22:47.574
so you know the market, right?

22:47.574 --> 22:50.202
So, okay, yeah, let's...

22:50.202 --> 22:51.495
let's do it, I guess.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.496
Great.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.791
-Ben?
-Hmm?

22:55.791 --> 22:58.293
I'll see you later,
around 6:00?

22:58.293 --> 22:59.878
I'm going to make

22:59.878 --> 23:01.505
that chicken casserole
that you like so much.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.756
You don't have to go
to all that trouble.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.633
It's not any trouble at all.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.428
Emma, I'll set up the open house
for this weekend.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.471
Okay.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.227
Chicken casserole, huh?

23:17.437 --> 23:19.815
I didn't know you were
such a fan, Benjamin.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.441
She makes a really good one.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.276
Don't say anything,
but almost as good as Mom's.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.074
That's saying a lot.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.327
Well, I mean, you know,
she's... she's lovely.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.455
I don't know her, you know?

23:35.455 --> 23:37.290
She's been helping me
with the listing,

23:37.290 --> 23:40.293
and, you know, she hasn't even
been in town long.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.795
What, like, five years?

23:41.795 --> 23:42.921
Six, actually.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.799
Right.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.134
[telephone rings]

23:48.468 --> 23:49.845
Excuse me.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.473
Hey, Nate.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.059
<i>Hey, there's my Em-azing girl.</i>

23:56.059 --> 23:57.477
<i>How's everything going?</i>

23:57.477 --> 23:58.937
Uh, it's cool, it's fine.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.605
I'm just doing some staging.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.400
<i>-Well, that's your thing.
</i>-That's my thing.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.818
<i>Listen, do you have
a minute to talk?</i>

24:04.818 --> 24:06.153
Uh, can I call you back?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.320
Don't worry.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.365
I actually have to go
to the factory.

24:10.365 --> 24:11.658
Are you okay
finishing up the tree?

24:11.658 --> 24:14.411
I've done it
hundreds of times.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.666
No, no, go ahead.
Go ahead.

24:19.666 --> 24:20.542
You first.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.335
Um... thank you.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.838
Thank you for helping me.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.173
No worries.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.216
I'll see you around?

24:28.216 --> 24:29.593
Mm-hmm.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.429
It's good to have you back.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.474
[Nate] <i> Em'? Hey, Em'?
 You there?</i>

24:37.517 --> 24:39.269
Yeah. Yeah.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.647
I'm here.

24:52.365 --> 24:56.203
Wow. I can't believe
this thing still works.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.205
And look what I brought.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.248
You are a champion.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.918
Well, I learned
from the champion herself.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.462
Well, don't I see

25:05.462 --> 25:07.547
a couple of ladies
who know how to nosh.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.383
Aurora! Oh, my goodness!

25:10.383 --> 25:12.510
It's good to see you!

25:12.510 --> 25:14.679
You are still
such a breath of fresh air.

25:15.722 --> 25:17.891
Do you... have any treats
for us to try?

25:17.891 --> 25:19.517
I do, I do.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.062
Just some
heavenly dark chocolate

25:22.062 --> 25:23.772
I've married with
some day-old popcorn.

25:23.772 --> 25:27.025
A better union
than my first husband and me.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.110
Although he did teach me
to follow my heart.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.197
Unfortunately, it led me
away from him.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.202
Mm. Delicious.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.914
Okay... got a little heat.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.290
Of course--

25:42.290 --> 25:45.085
because we know every marriage
needs a bit of that.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.711
She's right.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.091
Oh, I have some donations
for Kathy's food drive.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.592
Kathy will be so thrilled.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.886
You know how she loves
the spirit of the holidays.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.221
Mm-hmm.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.222
Kindness and compassion.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.224
And of course,

25:59.224 --> 26:00.767
she can definitely count on

26:00.767 --> 26:03.645
Simmons Lights'
annual holiday donation.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.898
You father always knew
how to make this town shine--

26:06.898 --> 26:08.024
in more ways than one.

26:09.317 --> 26:10.610
Now, if you'll
excuse me, ladies,

26:10.610 --> 26:12.445
I have another delivery
from Edna's Edibles

26:12.445 --> 26:14.364
I need to unpack.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.994
-She hasn't changed, huh?
-Uh-uh.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.122
-Hey, can we hang out a minute?
-Of course.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.415
All right, cool.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.171
You know what I love about us?

26:30.171 --> 26:31.298
What?

26:31.298 --> 26:33.800
That it can be years
since we've seen each other,

26:33.800 --> 26:36.011
and when we do,
it seems like yesterday.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.554
I love that about us, too.

26:38.805 --> 26:39.806
[whistling]

26:39.806 --> 26:42.350
Hey, no skates, no ice!

26:43.476 --> 26:44.477
Oh, look at these two.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.771
No food or drinks!

26:48.815 --> 26:50.650
Okay, but what if it's water,

26:50.650 --> 26:52.610
because, I mean,
that's frozen water.

26:52.610 --> 26:56.323
I mean, if it spills
and freezes...

26:56.323 --> 26:59.492
it really messes with
the condition of the ice,

26:59.492 --> 27:01.328
and then
our Zamboni guy, George,

27:01.328 --> 27:02.620
oh, my word,
he gets so upset.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.583
Oh, Zamboni in five minutes.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.625
Five minutes!

27:08.918 --> 27:10.712
Rose is still
running this place

27:10.712 --> 27:12.172
like a tight ship.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.132
Oh, my gosh,
like the day she started,

27:14.132 --> 27:16.176
when it was a summer intern.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.302
Yup.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.095
Things have not changed
around here.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.181
[Emma] Home sweet home.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.936
Speaking of home,

27:26.936 --> 27:28.688
what's up
with Ben and Heather?

27:28.688 --> 27:31.274
I wish I could tell you,

27:31.274 --> 27:32.359
but every time I ask Phil,

27:32.359 --> 27:33.693
he just says
they're just hanging out.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.780
Men. They never know
how to get the dirt on things.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.284
It would be nice for Ben
if they were...

27:42.827 --> 27:43.995
Would it?

27:45.455 --> 27:46.664
-What's all that about?

27:46.664 --> 27:47.957
What?

27:47.957 --> 27:49.667
Come on, Em'.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.336
This is Ben we're talking about.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.921
I mean, why do you think
it's taken him so long

27:52.921 --> 27:54.047
to "hang out" with someone?

27:54.047 --> 27:55.507
Because, unfortunately,

27:55.507 --> 27:57.384
everyone's moving away
from here.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.928
Because he's held a torch
for you forever.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.180
Come on, Lil'.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.016
I left Cherry Creek
20 years ago.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.312
When you love someone...

28:09.312 --> 28:10.647
time doesn't change that.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.442
What about you?
Anyone new in your life?

28:16.736 --> 28:20.198
My colleague, Nate, and I
started a new partnership.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.324
Mm-hmm.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.204
I'm single
because I'm busy, okay?

28:26.204 --> 28:27.372
Mm-hmm.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.958
It's not because
I'm still in love with Ben.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.963
I moved on
when I left Cherry Creek.

28:34.963 --> 28:35.964
Okay?

28:35.964 --> 28:37.465
Okay.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.386
[Aurora] Oh, no, baby,
that's not for you.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.933
That looks great, Emma.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.893
Thank you.
Come have a seat.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.437
-All right.

28:50.437 --> 28:54.315
A little more Christmas
can't hurt curb appeal.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.152
So how was dinner?

28:57.152 --> 28:58.736
It was great.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.909
By the way, great news.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.620
Interest is picking up
in the house.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.289
You know,
it's actually incredible

29:09.289 --> 29:12.375
what a few lights
and ribbons can do.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.006
You're absolutely right.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.175
Heather, you are so right!

29:20.175 --> 29:22.135
It is incredible!

29:22.135 --> 29:23.261
[laughing]

29:26.639 --> 29:29.309
No, Mr. Thompson,
I haven't made a decision yet.

29:30.685 --> 29:31.811
No, not on
the job offer either,

29:31.811 --> 29:33.188
but thank you,

29:33.188 --> 29:34.522
and I will, by the New Year.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.150
I have to go,

29:37.150 --> 29:38.234
but you'll be hearing
from me soon.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.611
Okay, thanks.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.653
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.489
-What are you doing here?
-I need some lights.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.073
-You got any to spare?
-Do I.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.116
Okay.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.075
Come on.
We'll hit the warehouse.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.118
Wait a minute.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.661
Why is it so quiet around here?

29:49.954 --> 29:51.956
How bad is business?

29:51.956 --> 29:53.166
[Phil] Hey, lady!

29:53.166 --> 29:55.668
Is this guy bothering you?
Should I call security?

29:55.668 --> 29:57.170
I'm a Simmons.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.671
That's right.

29:58.671 --> 29:59.839
So, Ben,

29:59.839 --> 30:02.008
shouldn't Emma
actually be your boss?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.176
Yeah, well, that would mean

30:03.176 --> 30:05.136
she'd have to be
yours, too, Phil,

30:05.136 --> 30:07.055
except her father
put me in charge, remember?

30:09.224 --> 30:10.308
How many lights do you need?

30:10.308 --> 30:11.851
A lot.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.478
For?

30:13.478 --> 30:15.980
Why don't you come down
to Main Street later and see?

30:15.980 --> 30:18.358
All right,
I think I'll just do that.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.777
Well, alrighty then.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.779
I know where the warehouse is.
Thank you.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.368
What?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.161
There ain't enough
casserole in the world

30:30.161 --> 30:31.704
to make you look like that.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.289
You don't know
what you're talking about, man.

30:33.289 --> 30:36.709
Besides, she already
has herself a Nate.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.211
Who calls her Em-azing.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.380
So silly.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.923
Is that with an "A" or an "E"?

30:45.885 --> 30:49.305
I can't wait to see the shop
all lit up!

30:49.305 --> 30:51.474
Are you handing out lights
to the whole town?

30:51.474 --> 30:53.309
Yes, I am,

30:53.309 --> 30:55.979
and that's not all.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.565
I am decorating
all of Main Street

30:58.565 --> 30:59.774
from top to bottom.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.402
Because I was thinking.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.029
If a few decorations
sparked interest in my house,

31:05.029 --> 31:08.741
why not get even more buyers
into town by lighting it up?

31:10.368 --> 31:11.369
It can't hurt.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.870
And the town needs it.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.414
Do you think you could
spare a few lights

31:14.414 --> 31:16.082
to help set deck
the school stage?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.376
Liam's class is guess what...

31:18.376 --> 31:20.545
doing a production of...

31:20.545 --> 31:22.297
"A Christmas Carol."

31:22.297 --> 31:24.382
Shut up!

31:24.382 --> 31:26.551
Ms. Fisher
is still putting that on?

31:26.551 --> 31:29.262
Every year, my friend.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.930
I'm off tomorrow,
so I can help you deliver them.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.141
If you need any help,
just let me know.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.143
Thanks, Lil'.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.311
All right, I'm outta here.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.312
See ya later.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.855
-Bye.
-Bye.

31:39.897 --> 31:41.190
Can I get this to go?

31:54.912 --> 31:56.205
-Hey.
-Hi.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.290
What's...

31:57.290 --> 31:58.291
What's all this?

31:58.291 --> 31:59.292
This is how Cherry Creek

31:59.292 --> 32:01.419
is supposed to look
at Christmas.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.129
You did all this by yourself?

32:03.129 --> 32:05.048
Some of the shopkeepers helped.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.382
And you're here now...

32:06.382 --> 32:08.843
Feel like climbing a ladder?

32:08.843 --> 32:09.927
Well, it's your lucky day.

32:09.927 --> 32:11.804
I just happen to be
an expert ladder climber.

32:11.804 --> 32:12.889
Yeah, yeah.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.099
Where do you want me
to put this?

32:15.099 --> 32:16.142
-Right up there.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.310
-All right.
-Thank you.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.686
-Hey?
-Mm-hmm?

32:18.686 --> 32:19.896
Remember that time
we climbed that ladder

32:19.896 --> 32:21.105
to the roof of the factory?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.482
-Oh, yeah!

32:22.482 --> 32:23.608
Only to realize,

32:23.608 --> 32:26.444
"Hey, we could have just
climbed out of any window

32:26.444 --> 32:28.071
on the second floor.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.280
We wanted to get the best seats

32:29.280 --> 32:31.908
so we could see the turning on
of the town tree.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.202
And, of course, I remember.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.412
It was the first time
that you asked me out on a date.

32:37.955 --> 32:39.332
Ice skating!

32:39.332 --> 32:42.669
Knowing full well that
I was a horrible ice skater!

32:42.669 --> 32:44.754
Yeah, I know.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.756
I used it to my advantage.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.924
How's that?

32:47.924 --> 32:52.345
I figured you were, you know.
unstable on the ice,

32:52.345 --> 32:54.514
you might need me
to hold your hand.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.308
-Really?
-Really.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.267
And it worked.

32:59.852 --> 33:00.853
Hmm?

33:02.021 --> 33:02.855
I'm good, huh?

33:02.855 --> 33:04.190
[laughing]

33:05.233 --> 33:06.359
All right, what's next?

33:06.359 --> 33:07.485
Follow me,

33:07.485 --> 33:09.278
and bring the ladder!

33:09.278 --> 33:10.530
Yes, ma'am.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.282
All right.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.034
This is the last of the lights.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.161
We used a lot of them.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.287
Yeah, we did.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.206
I hope we don't blow
the town's electrical grid.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.666
Don't worry.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.876
I equipped them
with surge protectors years ago,

33:23.876 --> 33:26.295
so...
if they're still working...

33:28.214 --> 33:29.799
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

33:35.012 --> 33:36.139
Oh!

33:37.223 --> 33:38.391
Beautiful!

33:38.391 --> 33:40.268
Wow.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.521
I have not see Main Street

33:43.521 --> 33:46.190
look this spectacular
in a long time.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.193
Yeah, it is pretty amazing.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.028
I couldn't have done this
without you, Ben.

33:51.028 --> 33:52.071
Thank you very much.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.032
I was happy to, Em'.
I mean, look at it.

33:55.032 --> 33:57.243
You're lighting up
the town again.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.080
Yeah.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.415
Want to call it a night?

34:03.916 --> 34:05.084
Let's call it a night.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.879
-Emma?
-Mm-hmm?

34:07.879 --> 34:11.466
If you ever need anything--
anything at all--

34:11.466 --> 34:12.717
call me.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.594
No thanks required.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.764
-Thanks.
-Hey.

34:50.922 --> 34:55.134

35:48.896 --> 35:50.439
[laughs]

35:59.198 --> 36:01.075
Oh... what a great kitchen.

36:01.075 --> 36:03.202
And we wouldn't have to
gut it completely.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.037
Maybe just the cabinets
and a new island.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.419
Your family?

36:11.419 --> 36:13.921
My mom and dad.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.132
Yeah, they built this house
in the '70s,

36:16.132 --> 36:18.050
but the land
has been in my family

36:18.050 --> 36:19.427
for generations,

36:19.427 --> 36:20.344
dating all the way back

36:20.344 --> 36:23.014
to my great-grandfather,
Roy Simmons.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.557
How sweet.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.854
They're offering
about 5% below asking,

36:29.854 --> 36:31.272
but at least that way,
they can renovate.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.273
Reno--

36:32.273 --> 36:33.316
I'm sorry, no.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.526
I'm not entertaining
any offers below asking.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.612
Emma, we have been over this.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.571
It wasn't moving.

36:40.197 --> 36:41.574
[woman] Does the second bedroom
upstairs have an en suite?

36:41.574 --> 36:44.535
No, but one could
easily be added

36:44.535 --> 36:46.829
if you take out
the adjoining room.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.414
That's my bedroom!

36:51.417 --> 36:52.418
I said that out loud.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.671
I'm sorry.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.633
Please, take a look around.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.721
3%.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.306
3% below asking.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.933
If they take that, maybe.

37:08.225 --> 37:10.436
I will entertain that offer.
Maybe!

37:10.436 --> 37:11.604
Gut my kitchen--
I'll gut you.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.483
Shall we take a look
at those bedrooms?

37:27.161 --> 37:28.162
Bam!

37:33.459 --> 37:34.460
Where did you find these?

37:34.460 --> 37:35.419
Daddy's study.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.713
I hadn't started
packing anything up yet,

37:37.713 --> 37:39.006
so I didn't see them sooner.

37:40.549 --> 37:41.842
So what are we looking at?

37:42.802 --> 37:44.136
Well, it looks like

37:44.136 --> 37:46.055
he was trying to play around
with watts and voltage.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.808
To create a new light?

37:48.808 --> 37:49.809
Yeah. Could be.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.144
But I won't know for sure

37:52.144 --> 37:53.437
until I have more time
to decipher these.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.563
-Do you mind?
-No, of course not.

37:54.563 --> 37:55.982
You're the only one
who understands them.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.943
You knew
how Daddy's brain worked

37:58.943 --> 38:00.319
because it's just like yours.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.531
Well, let's hope my brain
doesn't fail me now.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.243
All right...

38:11.122 --> 38:12.498
[Emma] The kids must be busy

38:12.498 --> 38:15.584
making their decorations for
the town Christmas tree, huh?

38:15.584 --> 38:17.378
Actually, they haven't been.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.213
What? Why?
It's school tradition.

38:19.213 --> 38:22.341
You and I even made them
when we went here.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.592
I know, except this year,

38:23.592 --> 38:26.095
the town scrapped
the annual lighting event.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.680
What?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.598
Why?

38:29.598 --> 38:33.185
I mean, that's just as big
as the town Christmas Eve party.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.186
Yeah...

38:34.186 --> 38:36.439
they scrapped that, too.

38:36.439 --> 38:37.732
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

38:37.732 --> 38:38.816
Why?

38:38.816 --> 38:39.984
-Every year,

38:39.984 --> 38:43.070
the celebrations keep getting
smaller and smaller,

38:43.070 --> 38:44.864
but this year, nothing.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.201
Trust me, my family's
really disappointed.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.579
I'm disappointed.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.080
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.128
Oh, wow...

39:00.588 --> 39:02.048
Oh, man, Lily!

39:04.467 --> 39:05.718
Hey, remember this?

39:05.718 --> 39:08.012
How Ms. Fisher used to
get up here all the time,

39:08.012 --> 39:11.766
and preach to us about
emoting from the stage.

39:11.766 --> 39:12.767
Yes.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.981
Boys and girls,

39:18.981 --> 39:23.110
you must use your whole body...

39:23.110 --> 39:25.237
when expressing yourself.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.656
Remember my part?

39:29.075 --> 39:35.664
"I will honor Christmas Past,
Present, and Future.

39:36.832 --> 39:39.710
The spirit of the three,

39:39.710 --> 39:41.796
dwell within me,

39:41.796 --> 39:48.803
and I shall not shut out
the lessons that they teach!"

Hey, Ms. Fisher.

39:57.728 --> 39:58.687
I'm happy to see

39:58.687 --> 40:00.815
that you still remember
your lines

40:00.815 --> 40:03.901
and that the lessons I taught
were not lost on you.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.362
No, ma'am.
No, they were not.

40:06.362 --> 40:10.116
If we need an understudy,
I'll know where to find one.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.117

41:16.765 --> 41:18.017
[Emma] Hey.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.018
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.019
-I'm sorry.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.353
I probably should have called,

41:21.353 --> 41:22.688
but I was so excited,
I just came over.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.025
Is it about dad's plans?

41:27.443 --> 41:28.360
I think I figured them out.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.406
Okay, so...

41:33.657 --> 41:35.159
What your dad was trying to do

41:35.159 --> 41:36.994
was create a new Christmas light

41:36.994 --> 41:39.038
that projects more luminance
than ever before,

41:39.038 --> 41:40.748
but that uses less energy.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.000
A brighter Christmas light?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.043
-Exactly.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.085
Can you do it?

41:46.587 --> 41:47.838
That's the thing.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.257
See, your dad's plans
were never finished or tested--

41:50.257 --> 41:51.592
Yeah, I know.

41:51.592 --> 41:52.885
But I'm going to do
my very best

41:52.885 --> 41:54.386

41:55.971 --> 41:57.389
Yeah.

41:57.389 --> 41:59.433
Oh, Ben.
Oh, thank you!

something of your own over here.

42:11.403 --> 42:12.905
I am, indeed.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.740
My mom's sugar cookies.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.911
Oh, you mean the ones
with the colored sugar?

42:18.911 --> 42:19.912
Those would be the ones.

42:19.912 --> 42:20.913
Mm!

42:20.913 --> 42:21.914
So good!

42:23.207 --> 42:24.541
I mean, I would help you out,
but, you know...

42:24.541 --> 42:26.710
Oh, I know!

42:26.710 --> 42:28.587
But I'd be more than happy
to help you test them, though.

42:28.587 --> 42:29.588
Well, you know, I think

42:29.588 --> 42:30.881
you deserve
a little something-something

42:30.881 --> 42:32.424
for figuring Dad's plans out.

42:32.424 --> 42:34.802
So, why don't you tell me
more about that,

42:34.802 --> 42:36.971
and I will work on
this next batch.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.430
Your terms are acceptable.

42:39.431 --> 42:40.683
So...

your dad figured a way

42:41.642 --> 42:43.310
for the new bulbs

42:43.310 --> 42:44.770
to use less than

42:44.770 --> 42:47.648
the 600 milliamps of electricity
that they currently use...

42:49.275 --> 42:51.610
Pizza and cookies.

Yeah, right.

43:18.387 --> 43:21.557
You know, your dad once bought
a set of their lights

43:21.557 --> 43:23.892
just to check the quality.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.811
They only lasted one season.

43:25.811 --> 43:27.187
That's it.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.568
Come on.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.819
Let's get out of here.

43:33.819 --> 43:35.487
To go where?

43:35.487 --> 43:36.530
You'll see.

43:51.503 --> 43:54.465
[♪♪♪]

43:54.465 --> 43:56.342
-Oh, wow.
-Right?

43:56.342 --> 43:58.218
Look at this.

43:58.218 --> 44:00.012
I haven't been up here
in years.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.849
Used to be
our favorite spot to get away.

44:03.849 --> 44:04.850
Your bench!

44:04.850 --> 44:07.853
The bench that you made--
it's still here.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.229
Mm-hmm.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.023
-Looks good, too.
-Yeah!

44:16.153 --> 44:17.863
It's still sturdy.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.286
-Aw, thank you for this.
-My pleasure.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.163
I remember
we used to come up here

44:26.163 --> 44:29.708
after every single
Christmas Eve party.

44:29.708 --> 44:31.126
Yeah.

44:31.126 --> 44:35.964
[Emma] The night that the town
just shines the brightest

44:35.964 --> 44:37.508
because everybody has put out

44:37.508 --> 44:40.219
as many Christmas lights
as possible

44:40.219 --> 44:42.346
to make sure that Santa
would not miss

44:42.346 --> 44:44.848
little Cherry Creek
in his travels.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.517
Yeah, I remember that.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.893
Mm-hmm.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.397
And another night in particular.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.149
Our first kiss.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.153
Did you plan that, too?

44:58.153 --> 44:59.405
Like the skating?

45:01.407 --> 45:02.825
Uh, no.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.576
No, you shouldn't plan
something like that.

45:04.576 --> 45:06.078
It should just happen.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.754
Is it just me or...

45:16.922 --> 45:18.924
does the town seem dimmer?

45:21.009 --> 45:22.845
[Ben] No, it isn't just you.

45:26.473 --> 45:27.391
But if I can get

45:27.391 --> 45:28.517
those new brighter lights
to work,

45:28.517 --> 45:29.935
then maybe I can save
this place.

45:30.936 --> 45:31.937
What do you mean save it?

45:33.856 --> 45:35.190
You didn't answer me before.

45:36.608 --> 45:37.943
What's happening, Ben?
We'll talk.

45:37.943 --> 45:39.153
Come on, what's going on?

45:43.615 --> 45:45.868
If we don't turn things around
by the New Year's,

45:45.868 --> 45:48.954
Simmons is going to have to...

45:48.954 --> 45:52.291
Simmons is going to have to go
to the highest bidder.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.794
What?

46:00.466 --> 46:01.633
Why didn't you tell me this?

46:01.633 --> 46:03.635
Why didn't--
why didn't anyone tell me this?

46:03.635 --> 46:05.596
I already told you why.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.473
And, really, if I did,

46:07.473 --> 46:09.099
what difference
would it have made?

46:09.099 --> 46:10.559
Would you--
would you have come back?

46:10.559 --> 46:11.852
That's not the point.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.315
Who's bidding?

46:17.608 --> 46:18.567
Thompsons.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.277
Oh, come on, Ben!

46:20.277 --> 46:22.070
We don't have a choice, Emma.

46:22.070 --> 46:23.238
And I don't have
a choice either.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.531
If the factory closes,

46:24.531 --> 46:26.116
I'm going to have to accept
the job they offered me,

46:26.116 --> 46:27.534
no matter how bad it pains me.

46:28.785 --> 46:30.162
And I don't want that.

46:33.415 --> 46:36.210
So, if we want to get
our town and our factory

46:36.210 --> 46:37.419
back to where it was...

46:40.589 --> 46:42.758
...then we've got to realize
my father's plans, right?

46:45.344 --> 46:46.386
Yeah.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.514
Okay.

46:49.515 --> 46:50.849
So then you'd better
figure out

46:50.849 --> 46:52.601
how to make
those new lights work.

46:55.145 --> 46:58.273
And I will do everything I can
to brighten this place up.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.197
You got it, boss.

47:07.741 --> 47:08.742
Lil'!

47:08.742 --> 47:11.036
Hey.

47:11.036 --> 47:12.037
I'm over here.

47:13.288 --> 47:16.792
Girl! I got
the greatest tree ever!

47:16.792 --> 47:18.502
It's over 20 feet!

47:18.502 --> 47:19.586
What? For what? Your house!

47:19.586 --> 47:21.129
No!

47:21.129 --> 47:23.507
Okay, so I went down
to City Hall.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.008
They were so happy to see me!

47:25.008 --> 47:26.552
Of course.

47:26.552 --> 47:28.512
Okay, anyway,
so I went down to city hall,

47:28.512 --> 47:29.680
and I said to them

47:29.680 --> 47:30.889
that I cannot in good conscience

47:30.889 --> 47:32.724
allow them to cancel
the Christmas Eve party

47:32.724 --> 47:35.060
and the tree-lighting ceremony.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.895
So guess what?

47:36.895 --> 47:40.274
It's back on! Yeah!

47:40.274 --> 47:42.234
Yeah!

47:42.234 --> 47:43.569
Yes!

47:43.569 --> 47:44.570
I'm going to call the school

47:44.570 --> 47:45.571
and tell them that the kids

47:45.571 --> 47:46.572
better get
their creative caps on.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.698
Great!

47:47.698 --> 47:50.242
-Great!
-Great!

47:50.242 --> 47:51.326
Yes!

47:51.326 --> 47:52.995
I gotta still close the shop.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.501
-Hey.
-Hey.

47:59.501 --> 48:02.087
-Nice shirt.
-Nice shirt.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.756
So how's it going?
Any luck?

48:04.756 --> 48:05.757
Not really.

48:05.757 --> 48:07.259
How about you?

48:07.259 --> 48:08.844
Well, actually,
I've had some success.

48:08.844 --> 48:09.845
Really?

48:09.845 --> 48:10.929
Oh, yeah.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.599
So, anything I can do
around here to help?

48:13.599 --> 48:14.600
Yeah, sure.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.684
I mean, if you know anything

48:15.684 --> 48:17.269
about 20-gauge copper wiring
and filaments.

48:17.269 --> 48:18.854
Don't forget about
the copper contacts

48:18.854 --> 48:19.855
and the injection molding.

48:21.023 --> 48:22.107
Okay!

48:22.107 --> 48:24.610
-Whose baby girl am I?
-Right. Touche.

48:24.610 --> 48:25.611
Of course.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.112
-Okay, uh...
-What are we doing?

48:27.112 --> 48:28.447
Okay, well, first of all,

48:28.447 --> 48:31.158
you can wrap this
around the base, okay?

48:31.158 --> 48:32.784
-Mm-hmm...
-Make sure it's nice and tight.

48:32.784 --> 48:35.078
-Okay.
-Good.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.956
You are so passionate
about this.

48:37.956 --> 48:38.957
I am. I mean,

48:38.957 --> 48:40.709
for me,
there's no better feeling

48:40.709 --> 48:43.754
than seeing your creation
light up for the first time.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.213
You know, it's kind of like...

48:45.213 --> 48:46.173
-Magic.
-Magic.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.174
Yeah, exactly.

48:47.174 --> 48:48.467
So...

48:48.467 --> 48:50.969
So you think this magic
is ready to be tested?

48:50.969 --> 48:52.971
I think so.
Ready?

48:52.971 --> 48:54.848
-Born ready.
-Okay.

48:56.475 --> 48:57.517
Three, two...

49:01.313 --> 49:02.648
[crackling]

49:03.690 --> 49:05.651
That's not magic,
that's smoke.

49:05.651 --> 49:09.321
Maybe it's the type of wiring
or the wattage.

49:09.321 --> 49:10.656
[Heather] Hello?

49:10.656 --> 49:11.865
Ben, are you in--

49:13.450 --> 49:15.118
-I've been texting you.
-Heather--

49:15.118 --> 49:15.994
[Heather] We were supposed
to meet for coffee.

49:15.994 --> 49:17.371
Oh, my gosh.

49:17.371 --> 49:18.914
I am so sorry.

49:18.914 --> 49:20.499
I must have lost track of time.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.834
We've just been here
working on these new lights...

49:22.834 --> 49:24.002
Oh.

49:24.002 --> 49:26.254
Emma, I didn't realize
you were an engineer as well.

49:26.254 --> 49:27.255
Oh, no.

49:27.255 --> 49:29.007
I'm just my father's child.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.260
I don't know
if you guys realize,

49:32.260 --> 49:33.679
but my uncle was an engineer.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.347
-Is that right?
-He worked on tankers,

49:35.347 --> 49:37.432
so... I also know
a thing or two.

49:37.432 --> 49:38.642
-This connection...
-No, no, no!

49:38.642 --> 49:39.893
-No, no, no!
-No, no, no!

49:39.893 --> 49:40.894
Don't touch it!

49:42.396 --> 49:44.231
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.318
Maybe instead of coffee,

49:48.318 --> 49:50.779
we could meet for tea
or a dessert later tonight?

49:50.779 --> 49:52.864
I have the open house
at Emma's.

49:53.990 --> 49:55.450
Oh, no. I can...

49:55.450 --> 49:56.618
I can handle that.

49:56.618 --> 49:58.704
I appreciate that, Emma,

49:58.704 --> 50:01.623
but I did set up
to meet a few good prospects,

50:01.623 --> 50:03.375
so I think it would reflect
poorly if I wasn't there.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.377
Of course.

50:07.295 --> 50:09.214
Tomorrow morning.
Before work.

50:09.214 --> 50:10.382
Sounds good.

50:10.382 --> 50:12.050
And I won't forget
to set my reminder.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.886
All right then.

50:14.886 --> 50:16.680
I'll keep you posted
on the open house?

50:16.680 --> 50:17.973
Thank you.

50:17.973 --> 50:20.058
Good luck...

50:20.058 --> 50:21.101
with all this.

50:25.313 --> 50:26.565
We're goSo...eed it.

50:26.565 --> 50:27.566
back to making magic?

50:29.359 --> 50:31.611
I think we've done
enough damage for today.

50:33.071 --> 50:34.281
Right.

50:34.281 --> 50:35.824
Next time, no explosions.

50:45.917 --> 50:46.918
Alrighty...

50:52.340 --> 50:53.633
[Ben] I know
what will cheer you up.

50:53.633 --> 50:54.676
Why don't you come with me

50:54.676 --> 50:56.678
to my parents' house
for dinner tonight?

50:56.678 --> 50:58.555
I know they'd love to have you.

50:58.555 --> 51:00.766
Oh, I would love to see them.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.809
And they'd love to see you.

51:02.809 --> 51:04.227
I don't want
to put your mom out.

51:04.227 --> 51:05.979
You know, if she's not
expecting company,

51:05.979 --> 51:07.397
I don't want to throw her off.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.441
Emma, when I'm coming home
for dinner,

51:09.441 --> 51:11.526
my mom cooks enough
for a week.

51:11.526 --> 51:12.778
Seriously.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.279
And besides,
you're not company,

51:14.279 --> 51:15.906
you're practically family.

51:16.948 --> 51:18.408
Come on!

51:23.163 --> 51:24.873
Mom? Dad?

51:24.873 --> 51:27.417
[Mom] You know where I am--
in the kitchen.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.543
I hope you remembered

51:28.543 --> 51:29.669
to bring the Tupperware
I sent you home with

51:29.669 --> 51:31.254
so I can fill it up again.

51:31.254 --> 51:32.339
I did, I did.

51:32.339 --> 51:33.590
And I brought one for Emma.

51:33.590 --> 51:34.549
Emma?

51:34.549 --> 51:36.009
Mm-hmm.

51:36.009 --> 51:39.012
I would never turn down
leftovers of your stew,

51:39.012 --> 51:40.305
Mama Leo.

51:40.305 --> 51:42.557
Emma Simmons!

51:42.557 --> 51:43.600
Let me look at you.

51:45.352 --> 51:46.770
Carl, get in here!

51:47.729 --> 51:49.523
[Dad] I just pulled out
the hot plate from the buffet

51:49.523 --> 51:51.024
if that's what you're wondering.
Hi, son.

51:51.024 --> 51:52.651
[Mom] Forget that.
Look who's here.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.320
Emma?

51:55.320 --> 51:57.239
If it isn't little Em'.

51:57.239 --> 51:58.532
[Emma] Carl!

51:59.574 --> 52:01.576
-Are you back for Christmas?
-I'm not sure.

52:01.576 --> 52:02.619
Of course, she is, aren't you?

52:02.619 --> 52:03.912
It's been far too long

52:03.912 --> 52:05.372
since you've been home
for the holidays.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.374
What, about three years now?

52:07.374 --> 52:08.333
Yes, sir.

52:08.333 --> 52:09.668
That's right.

52:09.668 --> 52:12.254
The last holiday we saw you
was at the town Christmas party

52:12.254 --> 52:13.547
the year we got so much snow,

52:13.547 --> 52:16.299
everyone had to snowshoe
to Main Street.

52:16.299 --> 52:20.011
My dad had to get all of
our old skis out of the attic.

52:20.011 --> 52:22.097
Ben hitched a sleigh
to the back of his truck

52:22.097 --> 52:24.015
and hauled all the kids
from school

52:24.015 --> 52:25.016
so they wouldn't miss it.

52:26.142 --> 52:28.061
-That was a fun time.
-Yeah.

52:28.061 --> 52:30.272
Even better,
your father spiked the eggnog.

52:30.272 --> 52:31.398
Oh, no, sir!
Not my Daddy!

52:31.398 --> 52:32.482
Oh, yes!

52:34.609 --> 52:35.944
All right, you three,

52:35.944 --> 52:37.571
head on in
and have a seat at the table

52:37.571 --> 52:40.115
before my stew boils down.

52:40.115 --> 52:41.408
There we are.
Good to have you back.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.118
[Emma] It's good to be here.

52:43.118 --> 52:44.369
We got all night to catch up.

52:47.497 --> 52:52.168
Mama Leo, I almost forgot
how good your cooking is.

52:53.295 --> 52:54.296
It is truly a shame

52:54.296 --> 52:55.422
that you did not pass

52:55.422 --> 52:58.341
any of those skills on
to your son.

52:58.341 --> 52:59.342
I am stuffed, honey.

53:02.512 --> 53:03.930
Listen, I tried,

53:03.930 --> 53:05.640
but I couldn't get
his head out of the clouds

53:05.640 --> 53:08.059
or whatever else
was going on up there

53:08.059 --> 53:09.853
long enough to teach him.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.814
Thank goodness, your father
harnessed all that.

53:12.814 --> 53:14.941
Thank goodness, Ben stayed.

53:14.941 --> 53:16.234
[Carl] Yeah.

53:16.234 --> 53:19.779
[Emma] Simmons Lights
is incredibly lucky to have him.

53:19.779 --> 53:21.239
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

53:21.239 --> 53:24.534
None of us would even be here
if it wasn't for that factory.

53:25.535 --> 53:26.953
So cheers to Simmons.

53:26.953 --> 53:27.913
To Simmons.

53:27.913 --> 53:29.122
Cheers! Cheers!

53:30.874 --> 53:33.251
By the way,

53:33.251 --> 53:35.086
I'm sure I saw a tree standing
in front of the church today.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.923
I thought that was canceled.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.382
It was.

53:39.382 --> 53:40.425
But I went down there,

53:40.425 --> 53:43.261
and I told them
that as long as I'm here,

53:43.261 --> 53:44.596
we're gonna keep
that tradition.

53:44.596 --> 53:45.639
That's my girl.

53:45.639 --> 53:46.640
Preach.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.685
Baby girl,
I hope you don't go anywhere,

53:50.685 --> 53:52.979
'cause tradition is exactly

53:52.979 --> 53:54.856
the glue this town needs
to stay together.

53:54.856 --> 53:55.899
Hear, hear.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.776
We're gonna need
a little more than that.

54:04.199 --> 54:05.700
This one will be for you.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.369
Thank you.

54:07.369 --> 54:10.330
You always did
take such good care of us.

54:11.623 --> 54:13.750
Well, I just wish Ben
had someone to look after him

54:13.750 --> 54:14.793
other than me.

54:16.628 --> 54:18.254
Look at him out there--

54:18.254 --> 54:19.673
changing that bulb.

54:21.591 --> 54:22.968
How is he?

54:25.512 --> 54:27.013
Really?

54:28.431 --> 54:29.808
He's hard on himself.

54:31.601 --> 54:33.269
Worries about
keeping Simmons afloat.

54:35.605 --> 54:37.065
But...

54:37.065 --> 54:41.194
I'm sure after seeing you here,
it's much better now.

54:42.570 --> 54:43.989
He misses you.

54:45.281 --> 54:46.616
We all do.

54:46.616 --> 54:48.660
This town just isn't the same
without a Simmons.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.498
Maybe I can...

54:53.498 --> 54:54.582
I don't know,

54:54.582 --> 54:57.002
extend my stay a little longer.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.672
You know if you do,

55:00.672 --> 55:04.175
there's always a spot for you
to hang your stocking.

55:05.468 --> 55:09.347
And always a seat for you
at the table.

55:16.563 --> 55:17.897
I know.

55:20.608 --> 55:21.651
Thank you.

55:22.569 --> 55:24.612
Baby...

55:24.612 --> 55:26.364
no need to thank family.

55:31.661 --> 55:32.954
[Carl snoring]

55:32.954 --> 55:36.374
Now, I can hear Carl snoring
in that armchair from here,

55:36.374 --> 55:38.501
so I'd better get
the old man off to bed.

55:38.501 --> 55:40.545
He's getting it in.

55:47.719 --> 55:51.598
[♪♪♪]

55:51.598 --> 55:53.141
[Emma] Hey.

55:53.141 --> 55:54.726
Hey, you.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.979
Did my mom haul my dad
out of the armchair yet?

55:57.979 --> 55:59.355
She's on it right now.

55:59.355 --> 56:01.483
Every year.

56:01.483 --> 56:04.611
-Thank you.
-Oh, yeah. Thank you....

56:06.071 --> 56:08.364
...for bringing me
here tonight.

56:10.992 --> 56:14.370
It's just like old times, huh?

56:14.370 --> 56:15.663
It felt good.

56:15.663 --> 56:18.041
It feels good to me, too.

56:19.667 --> 56:21.086
[cell phone ringing]

56:22.587 --> 56:23.797
Nate...

56:26.508 --> 56:28.259
You should probably get that.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.427
It's all right.

56:29.427 --> 56:31.554
We've been texting all day.

56:31.554 --> 56:32.639
I'll call him back later.

56:33.723 --> 56:35.016
You know, that whole
partnership with him

56:35.016 --> 56:36.601
sounds like a great opportunity.

56:36.601 --> 56:38.520
It is, actually.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.439
So I'm sure you're hoping

56:41.439 --> 56:43.108
Heather had
a successful open house.

56:45.235 --> 56:46.319
I guess.

56:47.904 --> 56:49.823
So why are you...

56:49.823 --> 56:51.533
making such an effort
in this town

56:51.533 --> 56:54.119
if you're just
going back to Phoenix?

56:55.954 --> 56:57.330
I hadn't planned on it.

56:59.415 --> 57:00.625
When I got back here...

57:03.920 --> 57:05.463
...I realized it's still home.

57:06.965 --> 57:11.636
My great-grandfather's factory
brought people here for work.

57:13.888 --> 57:15.181
A town was created.

57:16.558 --> 57:18.143
I can't just throw that away.

57:19.519 --> 57:20.937
So, I thought I'd just,
you know,

57:20.937 --> 57:22.147
see what I could do
while I was here.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.984
And if the lights
don't work, well...

57:29.154 --> 57:31.573
Emma, I can't guarantee
they will.

57:31.573 --> 57:34.951
It will not be the first time
I've been disappointed.

57:38.163 --> 57:39.539
Emma...

57:41.958 --> 57:43.293
what is it?

57:44.836 --> 57:48.423
'Cause I know you,

57:48.423 --> 57:50.717
and I know there's got to be

57:50.717 --> 57:53.219
more to why you went
800 miles to Phoenix...

57:55.263 --> 57:56.598
a place that couldn't possibly

57:56.598 --> 57:58.016
be more different
than your hometown.

57:59.642 --> 58:02.145
When my mom got sick,
I was only eight years old.

58:03.146 --> 58:04.272
I remember that.

58:04.272 --> 58:05.565
And I would remember

58:05.565 --> 58:08.985
all the times that my dad
would tell that story,

58:08.985 --> 58:10.486
when he was decorating the tree,

58:10.486 --> 58:15.158
about my great-grandfather
getting his son better...

58:15.158 --> 58:19.579
when he would string up
all those painted lights.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.250
So I tried it.

58:26.753 --> 58:30.590
I decorated my mom's room
with lights.

58:33.259 --> 58:34.719
It didn't work.

58:40.516 --> 58:43.228
Until then, I had believed

58:43.228 --> 58:45.438
every word that my dad
and my whole family

58:45.438 --> 58:48.733
had said for generations
about lights.

58:50.735 --> 58:52.278
And how magical they are.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.369
But after that...

58:59.369 --> 59:01.412
I wanted
nothing to do with them.

59:01.412 --> 59:03.581
Why didn't you ever
tell me this?

59:04.791 --> 59:06.292
I'm sorry.

59:08.419 --> 59:12.006
But it was mine...

59:12.006 --> 59:13.466
and I buried it.

59:13.466 --> 59:16.469
My dad didn't even know.

59:16.469 --> 59:18.763
The crazy thing is...

59:21.391 --> 59:22.767
I want to believe again.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.604
I really do.

59:36.781 --> 59:37.949
I'm gonna go.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.119
Emma...

59:42.954 --> 59:44.455
I'm gonna make you
believe again.

59:47.583 --> 59:48.793
I promise.

59:56.509 --> 59:58.136
I'm gonna go home.

01:00:04.225 --> 01:00:05.268
[Nate] <i> Emma, there you are.</i>

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.602
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:07.812
<i>I mean, you haven't returned
my text messages.</i>

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:08.938
I know, I know,

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.482
and I'm really sorry.

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:12.400
It's been busy.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.235
<i>Busy with the sale, I hope.</i>

01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:15.320
<i>So how's it going?</i>

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.238
Uh...

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:18.197
it's going.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:19.824
<i>As in going, going, gone?</i>

01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:21.200
Not yet.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.287
Hey, um...

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.580
do you believe in magic?

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.165
<i>Look, Emma, I believe</i>

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.250
<i>that you can make
magic happen, okay?</i>

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.918
<i>Like selling
that house of yours.</i>

01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:32.211
<i>You just can't give up.</i>

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:34.881
You know, Nate,

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.342
you actually kind of
make sense right now.

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.178
Thank you.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:41.637
<i>Always happy to help.</i>

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.181
I'll keep you posted.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:52.857
Hey, guys!

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:53.858
Whoo!

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:56.027
Ah, there you are!

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:58.029
All right, kids,

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:02.116
Ms. Simmons is here
to get you all started on what?

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:04.535
[children] Tree decorations!

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.788
Yes, yes, yes!

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:08.373
So let's get started

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:12.668
so we can make
that tree shine so bright!

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.253
-Whoo!
-Let's do it.

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:17.840
Oh, look at these.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.510
Here you go.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.805
My mom says you're going
to light up the whole town

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.223
brighter than it's ever been.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.725
Did she say that, now?

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:28.768
Uh-huh.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:32.021
She says it's your "density."

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.440
You just don't know it.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.568
It seems you've created
quite a stir here, Emma.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:39.654
Not just in my classroom.

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:40.863
My own grandkids

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.365
weren't coming this year
for the holidays,

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.367
but when they found out

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.744
that the tree ceremony
was on again,

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:49.080
they begged my son
to bring them.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.918
So your efforts
are making a real buzz.

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:55.128
Near and far.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.590
You just gave me a great idea.

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:00.591
Oh, Ms. Fisher!

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:01.926
Oh, thank you!

01:02:01.926 --> 01:02:02.885
Okay!

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:05.304
All right...

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:10.226
Okay, kids, let's make
Cherry Creek sparkle!

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.603
[children] Yay!

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:18.526
Very nice.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:21.112
Oh, oh, oh. Almost.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.905
There you go.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:26.492
Think we got enough
lights on there?

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:28.578
I wrapped it in about 3,000.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.122
Double the recommended
lighting per foot.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.123
Oh, it's perfect.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:34.625
Standards are not meant
for Cherry Creek.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.919
We need this tree to shine.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:39.630
For a lot of reasons.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.299
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:44.302
What you got
up your sleeve, Simmons?

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.596
I called the local press,

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.763
and I told them

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:51.559
that Simmons Lights
has an announcement.

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:53.811
-You didn't?
-I did.

01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:55.521
Why not, huh?

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.523
I mean, we need
to create a buzz,

01:02:57.523 --> 01:02:59.609
and people need...

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.944
they need to get excited.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.488
It's time
for people to remember

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:06.991
that Simmons is still
the name in Christmas lights.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.204
I'm not giving up, are you?

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.163
Never.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.582
Six, five, four,

01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:18.127
three, two, one...

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.504
[crowd cheering]

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.467
Great job.
Looks beautiful.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.345
That tree
is definitely not standard.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.264
Looks like another Simmons
is finding a way to shine.

01:03:30.264 --> 01:03:34.393
♪ This little light of mine ♪

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:37.146

Emma!

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.946
Christmas may have come
early for us.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.198
We have a very interested buyer

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.449
from the open house
the other night.

01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:49.450
Oh, great.

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.451
Yeah, he'd like to come

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.786
take another look
at the house tomorrow.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:52.828
Sure. Of course.

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.205
Okay, great.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:55.289
And Ben?

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:56.541
Maybe we can go
for that coffee afterwards?

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.085
Yeah, yeah.
That would be good.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.044
Excuse me.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:01.879
-Emma Simmons?
-Uh-huh.

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:04.257
Hi. I'm Katy Jenkins
from Channel 37 News.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.466
Yes, hello.

01:04:05.466 --> 01:04:06.634
We're ready for you if you are.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:07.885
Okay, yes.

01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:08.928
Oh, you know what,

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.054
I would really like

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:11.264
to include our head engineer,
Ben Shields,

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.557
in the interview.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:13.599
Uh, wait.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:15.017
No, no, you don't have to.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.228
I do.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:18.437
Great. Follow me.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.274
Okay...

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:22.233
Right here.

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:23.526
Okay.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.904
Yeah, great, and just
a little bit closer.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:27.947
Yeah. That's it.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.240
We got this.

01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:31.826
Okay, so I'll introduce you,

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.452
and then both of you
can take it away.

01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.162
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:36.455
Take what away exactly?

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.165
We're good.

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:39.834
I'm here in Cherry Creek

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.544
for the town's
annual tree lighting,

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.213
compliments of the oldest name
in Christmas lights,

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.339
Simmons,

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:46.924
who have a very special
announcement to make--

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:49.969
and here to make it
is Emma Simmons herself.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.681
So, Emma what do you have
in store for us?

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:56.350
Well, we have
a new and exciting light

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:57.518
that will outshine

01:04:57.518 --> 01:04:59.437
all the holiday lights
on the market

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:02.648
and make them even seem
a little dull in comparison.

01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:06.360
Wow. Sounds
absolutely brilliant.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.530
And when will we be treated
to this spectacle?

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:10.865
Christmas, of course.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:11.907
Of course.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.493
Well, there you have it.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:15.703
Simmons will be turning on

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:17.371
its newest
and brightest lights

01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:20.124
just in time to light up
the holidays this Christmas.

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:23.252
That was great.

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.587
Great.
Thanks so much.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:25.755
-Thank you.
Come on.

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:28.883
Okay, I know,

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:30.843
and I don't want to add
any pressure to you,

01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:32.094
I really don't,

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:35.264
but, Ben, I just feel like
this is--this is our shot.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.309
You're right.

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:40.227
And I get it.

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:42.021
I mean, look--
look at all their faces.

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:45.316
It's like they're starting
to believe again.

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.068
Yeah.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:48.694
And we can't let them down.

01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:49.820
Mm-mm.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.988
And we won't.

01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:00.456
[Lily] So, I guess you guys
have another project.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.041
That we do.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.626
If you guys can pull this off,

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.753
I promise I will wear
the exact replica

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:07.880
of my costume
from Ms. Fisher's class

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.423
to the Christmas Eve party.

01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:10.508
Not the one you wore

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.218
when you played
the ghost of Christmas past?

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.302
That's the one!

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.470
[Phil] Oh, that is way too good
to pass up.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.888
Bud, we have to make sure
this thing happens now.

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:16.972
No doubt.

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:17.973
You better get to sewing, Lily.

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:18.933
Oh, it's on.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:19.934
I have the material
and everything.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.811
-Stop teasing.
-I'm not, I never tease.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.354
All right, here we go.
Simmons on three.

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:24.355
One, two, three!

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.023
Simmons!

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.154
I can't wait to see this. Wow!

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:19.702
[♪♪♪]

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.048
[Heather] And don't forget
about the back deck.

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.760
It's a great spot to barbecue
for you and your kids.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.762
I'll let you take another look,
okay, so you can soak it all in.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:39.388
[man] Great. Thank you.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:45.394
You know, because of the way
you've dressed up this town,

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:46.479
I have been getting

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.773
a lot more calls
from interested buyers.

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:50.941
Really?

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.907
-Emma?
-Mm-hmm?

01:08:00.284 --> 01:08:02.161
Are you still selling
this place?

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.918
What do you mean?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.587
It seems to me
like your heart isn't in it.

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.968
And I'm just wondering
where it is.

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:25.684
Emma sure outdid herself
the other night

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:28.187
with that tree ceremony.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:29.563
I know.

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:31.982
I just hope we didn't overdo it
with that press statement.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:34.609
I heard because of that

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.237
we've had people calling in
to human resources,

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.531
inquiring about job interviews.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.823
For real?

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.033
That's right.

01:08:42.158 --> 01:08:44.495
Seems to me she's gotten
pretty invested in the place.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.251
She's already got a partner

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.836
waiting for her
back in Phoenix, Phil.

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:54.964
Well, maybe
she'll keep him waiting

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.173
if you told her how you felt.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:58.509
<i>[doorbell rings]</i>

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.135
Hi!

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.636
Leo!

01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:03.889
What a wonderful surprise.

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:05.307
I hope so.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.393
I'm not interrupting anything?

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:08.644
Oh, of course not.

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:09.812
Come on in here.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.897
I was just making
a few batches of my eggnog

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:13.314
for the Christmas Eve Party,

01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:16.318
and I thought how much
I'd love to raise a glass,

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:18.444
but, of course,
Carl was asleep, so...

01:09:18.444 --> 01:09:19.697
here I am.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:21.073
In all your glory!

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:23.492
Come on in
and I will get us some glasses.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:26.620
Now, he is still planning
on dressing up as Santa

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.955
for the party, right?

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.497
Well, he is if he can
stay awake long enough.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:30.916
I tell you,

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:33.042
I've been telling that man
to retire for years now.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:35.296
-Well, you know
better than that.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:37.548
You know those two.

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:39.716
My Daddy would never
have retired either.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.136
So, how goes it

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.386
with these Christmas lights
I keep hearing about?

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:46.473
I don't know.

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:49.685
Poor Ben,
he's under so much pressure

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:52.479
to get all those lights
finished by Christmas--

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.648
and that's in three days.

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:56.984
Why did I even say--

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:57.943
Never mind.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:01.739
He'll manage.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.157
Don't you worry.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:05.242
But what if he doesn't?

01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:06.660
I mean, does he--

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.245
would he take that job
at Thompsons?

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:13.000
He's been at Simmons--
I mean, since he was a kid--

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.462
when he was interning for Daddy.

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:21.216
There's no doubt
it would be hard.

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:22.718
On everyone.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.845
But you're right.
It would be the hardest on Ben.

01:10:24.845 --> 01:10:27.932
And he'd never take it
unless he had to.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:32.478
Ben, he holds on.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.562
Like you.

01:10:34.688 --> 01:10:36.106
He never let you go.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.318
Don't give me
that look, Emma Simmons,

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:41.779
'cause I see
the way he looks at you.

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:44.907
Like he always has.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:45.908
And by the way,

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.494
I saw the way
you looked at him, too.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.546
[moans]

01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:01.298
I gotta get back
to the factory.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.801
You have been working
extra hard

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.636
at the factory these days.

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:06.679
Yeah.

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:07.972
Does that have anything to do

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:09.974
with these Christmas lights
everyone's been talking about?

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:12.351
-Pretty much.
-Yeah.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:13.310
Well, it must be nice

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:16.313
to have an actual Simmons
in town.

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:17.856
I mean Emma, of course.

01:11:23.487 --> 01:11:25.322
You know, Ben...

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.787
I like you, a lot,

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.372
and I think you like me, too.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:36.083
I do.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.211
Except you shouldn't
have to set up a reminder

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:40.754
that we have a date.

01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:43.424
I know, my head
has just been spinning

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:45.175
with all these new lights and...

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:46.677
And Emma?

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:51.140
I'm sorry, Heather.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.100
I understand.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.519
And I'm not looking
for an apology.

01:11:57.604 --> 01:12:00.941
What I'm looking for

01:12:00.941 --> 01:12:05.154
is someone whose head will spin
a little because of me.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.534
Of course.

01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:12.995
You're right.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:15.581
I shouldn't have to be reminded.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.042
Then let's make this easier
on the both of us.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.045
Friends?

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:23.422
Friends.

01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:31.555
Emma! Hey!

01:12:31.555 --> 01:12:32.556
-Hey.
-Look at this.

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:34.183
You are good for business,

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.768
so it looks like
you cannot leave,

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.686
otherwise, you're going
to make me bankrupt.

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.229
No pressure!

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.566
I'm gonna come back later
'cause you're really busy.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:44.026
-No, no, no, no!
My part-timer is right here.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.027
Just give me a second.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.695
[phone ringing]

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.116
Hey, Heather.

01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:52.743
I have great news.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.578
Remember that kind of cute guy
from the house the other day?

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:57.372
Well, he wants to make an offer.

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.707
Over asking.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.000
Yeah, that's great.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.502
<i>I know.</i>

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:02.878
Can I tell him we have a deal?

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:04.922
I'm sorry, but no... I...

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.299
I've got too much to figure out.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.510
Okay.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.636
I understand,

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.096
but we can't wait
too long, Emma.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:14.139
Yeah, I know.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.017
Sorry.

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:18.602
I know.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:24.024
[Nate] An offer over asking?

01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:25.692
Impressive.

01:13:25.692 --> 01:13:27.778
Where I'm from,
that is a done deal.

01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:30.280
Nate Scott.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.281
Heather Clarkson.

01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:33.367
Hey.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.952
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:38.705
No.

01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:40.165
Follow me.

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:42.626
I know what we can do
to cheer you up.

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:43.627
Come on.

01:13:47.297 --> 01:13:49.258
his is your idea
of getting my mind off things?

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:52.803
I just have to make a pick-up
and I need you to help me.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.683
Okay.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:58.725
[Ben] All right, this works.

01:13:58.725 --> 01:14:00.644
[Lily] Whoo-hoo!
All right, boys.

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:04.273
All work and no play
makes for a very dull holiday,

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.774
so you're both coming with us.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.609
We've still
got to test these lights.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:08.861
Uh, uh, uh.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.445
If they're going to work,
they're going to work later on,

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.613
and if not,

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:12.781
you'll get back
to the drawing board,

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.117
but to do that,
you need a clear head,

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.827
so come on!

01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:20.038
Whoo! Let's do this!

01:14:20.038 --> 01:14:21.790
Yeah!

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.876
Don't fight her, my friend.
You know it's futile.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:32.801
[tweets whistle]

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.720
Alrighty, here ya go.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.013
Now, just remember,

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.806
no walking on the pavement
unless you have the guards on.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:40.601
Can we use them on the ice?

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:43.020
You a rookie
all of a sudden, Simmons?

01:14:44.354 --> 01:14:45.355
No.

01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:46.440
Yes.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.318
I haven't done this in ages.

01:14:50.402 --> 01:14:52.362
Just think of it
like roller skating.

01:14:52.362 --> 01:14:53.405
[Lily] Exactly.

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:56.408
You'll be so focused
on not falling

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:58.160
that you won't be able
to about anything else.

01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:01.413
[Aurora] Some of Edna's Edibles
to give you wings on the ice?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.500
By the way,
Kathy's on the phone.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.585
Thanks to Simmons Lights'
food donation,

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.378
she has reached
her Christmas goal

01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:11.882
of 500 pounds of food
for families in need.

01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:14.218
Give yourselves
a merry ho-ho.

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:18.388
<i>Hi, everyone.
We did it!</i>

01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:19.806
<i>I never lost the faith.</i>

01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:22.100
<i>I knew Cherry Creek
still had the spirit.</i>

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.186
<i>Thank you guys so, so much.</i>

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.395
<i>I love you all,</i>

01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:28.148
<i>and I wish you a blessed
and very merry Christmas.</i>

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:29.483
Merry Christmas!

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.235
<i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.736
[Phil] Come on, darlin',
let's fly.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:34.571
Okay.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:40.285
You good?

01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:41.745
Uh-huh.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:43.789
I got you.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.252
All right, don't look at them,
look at me.

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:50.379
You got this.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.755
Take your time.

01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:53.048
All right, take your time.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.342
There you go.

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:56.677
[laughing]

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:58.387
Beautiful.

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:03.892
[Phil] Okay, okay.
Let me get this straight.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.979
It was you who put the ski wax
on the bottom of my toboggan

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:07.980
and not Ben?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.022
Guilty as charged.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:10.023
Come on, man,

01:16:10.023 --> 01:16:11.066
it's not like I'm gonna let

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.484
Emma take the heat
for all that, right?

01:16:12.484 --> 01:16:13.568
Aw, so chivalrous.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:15.946
Hey, that toboggan

01:16:15.946 --> 01:16:17.531
almost sent me
right into downtown Denver.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:18.782
Yes, it did!

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:22.244
Oh, you guys,
this is so good,

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.079
especially with
a little bit of cayenne.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.038
You know you want some.

01:16:25.038 --> 01:16:26.081
Try it.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.207
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Come on.

01:16:27.207 --> 01:16:28.959
That whole sweet and spicy stuff
is all you, girl.

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:31.628
Well, don't you knock it.

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.380
I know, I know,
you know what you like.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.798
That's right, I do.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.636
Well, Phil and I

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:40.929
should get home
to relieve the babysitter.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:43.181
Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine
if we stay out a bit long--

01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:44.808
[Lily kicks Phil]

01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:46.018
[Lily] We're going to go.

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.228
But this was a blast.

01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:49.730
Thank you.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.273
[Lily] Hey, I hope
we can do this again.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.190
Yeah.

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:53.400
[Lily] And again and again.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.485
-Good to see you guys.
-All right, get out of here.

01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:57.321
See you guys.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:58.697
Oh, man, I love those two.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.198
Yeah.

01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:02.576
Yeah, Phil's been
a real life-saver at work.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.453
You know, Lily was right.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.579
We really needed this.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:06.830
Mm-hmm.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.083
You know you've done more

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:12.794
than anyone else ever could have
for Simmons Lights, right?

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:16.214
Emma, your dad
has been so good to me.

01:17:16.214 --> 01:17:18.717
Because he loved you,
like a son.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.595
I loved him like a father.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:22.512
What in the world?

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.224
Nate? What are you doing here?

01:17:26.224 --> 01:17:28.393
[Nate] I just thought
I'd check in on my girl.

01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:30.354
See if I could be of any help
with this sale.

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:34.399
Uh, Nate, this is Ben.
Ben, this is Nate.

01:17:34.399 --> 01:17:36.026
Hey there.
Pleasure to meet you.

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.277
And you.

01:17:37.277 --> 01:17:39.279
So, I hear you got an offer
over asking.

01:17:39.279 --> 01:17:40.405
That's great.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:42.074
Hey, when an opportunity
like that comes knocking,

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.408
you should
really take it, right?

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:44.493
Yeah...

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.787
Or you could just
stick with what you've got,

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:49.539
'cause, I mean,
the grass may not be greener.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.710
Um...

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:55.253
I'm gonna call it a night.

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:56.296
I'm gonna tinker
a little bit more,

01:17:56.296 --> 01:17:57.297
because...

01:17:57.297 --> 01:18:00.384
tomorrow's the big day and all.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:01.385
Nate...

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.053
nice to meet you.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.346
Emma,

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.223
congratulations on that offer.

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:09.726
Goodnight.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:28.620
[♪♪♪]

01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:36.920
[Emma]
Don't look at me like that.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.713
The reason why I hadn't
accepted the offer on the house

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:40.298
is because I'm just--

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:42.968
Look, I had a nice chat
with Heather

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:43.969
when I first got here,

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.096
and she seems to know

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:47.931
why you've been hesitating
on this sale.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.892
And I think I do, too.

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:56.106
Anyway, I guess I'd better go
and check into my hotel.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:58.108
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
You're staying?

01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.068
Yeah. Why not?

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.571
I mean, it looks like this place
does Christmas up real nice.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:03.905
And besides,

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:05.740
I hear there's gonna be
a lot of opportunity here soon.

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:07.993
'Night.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:14.958
[♪♪♪]

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:34.060
<i>[Heather] And this right here
is the Christmas shop.</i>

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:38.064
It's open year-round.

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:41.151
And then up ahead,
around the corner,

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.235
you'll see...

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:44.362
All right.
Is it working okay?

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:50.285
Goodnight.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.381
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.550
-Are these our lights?
-They are.

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:06.718
Took all the crew we had
to turn this many out.

01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:08.887
But if they work,

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:11.056
it should be all we need
to get the effect we want.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:13.016
Then let's get them unloaded.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:23.109
[♪♪♪]

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:30.200
[Emma]
Merry Christmas, everybody.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.035
[crowd] Merry Christmas!

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:38.124
It's been a bit of a struggle
the last few years, huh?

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:42.045
And I'm sorry that I wasn't...

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:43.880
here with you,

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.758
but it kind of seems like
no matter where we are...

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.345
we're just kind of
coasting through life.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.931
Numb isn't the new joy.

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:56.851
Finding my father's plans
for this new, brighter light...

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.564
I discovered what he was
trying to tell all of us.

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.984
Think about how you
and others around you respond

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:06.570
when light is shining
so bright--

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.572
from within.

01:21:12.158 --> 01:21:13.785
Remember your inner light.

01:21:16.496 --> 01:21:17.747
When I was a little girl,

01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:20.000
my family taught me the song
"This Little Light of Mine."

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.420
And it's okay
if your light is little,

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.838
because if you share it,

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:28.633
you create...

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:29.968
brilliance.

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:36.641
So, tonight, Simmons Lights
proudly launches a new light,

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:38.643
brighter than this country
has ever seen,

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:40.937
so I'm going turn it over now

01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:47.444
to the man who saw
my father's vision through,

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.528
a man who I think

01:21:48.528 --> 01:21:50.780
is the most brilliant light
in Cherry Creek.

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:55.827
Mr. Ben Shields.

01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:05.420
Okay...

01:22:06.963 --> 01:22:08.548
let's count down.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:11.968
Five...

01:22:11.968 --> 01:22:13.345
four...

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.554
three...

01:22:14.554 --> 01:22:15.889
two...

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:17.557
one.

01:22:18.975 --> 01:22:21.144
[cheering]

01:22:26.816 --> 01:22:28.068
They really worked!

01:22:29.152 --> 01:22:30.862
You did it, buddy.

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.659
Not without your help, bro.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.036
Thanks, but it was all you.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.121
And her.

01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:54.678
Well, it looks really great,
doesn't it?

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.221
[Emma] It really does.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.181
Congratulations, Emma.

01:22:58.181 --> 01:22:59.182
You did it.

01:22:59.182 --> 01:23:01.184
Thank you.

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:03.395
Well, now, you know, I...

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.854
I didn't have anything,
really, to do.

01:23:04.854 --> 01:23:06.523
It was you and Ben.

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:10.985
You two lit the town up.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.156
So if I were you,

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.324
I wouldn't sell.

01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:19.077
And I second that.

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:23.915
I think you two
just might be right.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:26.084
I'm really glad
I made the trip out here, Emma,

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:27.377
and I got to tell you,

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.546
I... I get why you love
this place so much.

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.215
And now that
it's about to go off the hook,

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:34.217
I think...

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:36.261
you need
a great real estate team.

01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:42.267
So, Heather, tell me,
are you happy over at Bimark?

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.644
Because Emma could really
use some help

01:23:44.644 --> 01:23:45.729
with our new
Cherry Creek office.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.147
[laughing]

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:51.109
You, my friend, are incredible.

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:52.402
Thanks, Phil.

01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:53.570
The Internet is buzzing,

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.905
and Simmons already has
its own hashtag.

01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:57.907
You know what this means, right?

01:23:57.907 --> 01:23:59.617
You can't leave.
This town needs you.

01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:01.369
He's right.

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:05.331
Emma...

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:08.960
I would never pressure you...

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.588
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:14.257
I would like to introduce you...

01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:16.718
to the Ghost of Christmas Past.

01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:19.971
[cheering]

01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:23.641
Thank you, Mrs. Fisher!

01:24:23.641 --> 01:24:25.351
I told you I would do it!

01:24:25.351 --> 01:24:26.770
Yes, you did!

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.313
Light me up, baby!

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.566
[laughing]

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.610
-Oh, my gosh, honey.
-Thank you!

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:35.153
-Look at this.
-Right?

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:37.197
This is perfect.
You look so good.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.623
I, um...

01:24:46.623 --> 01:24:49.959
I know you have a life
in Phoenix.

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:53.213
But I didn't want you leaving

01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:54.881
without me telling you
how I really feel.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:59.803
'Cause I know you...

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:01.387
Emma...

01:25:03.139 --> 01:25:04.808
...better than anyone else.

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.020
No matter
what's in Phoenix for you...

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:13.024
I know...

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:15.652
that this is where you belong.

01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:20.824
With me.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:23.618
I know a few thing, too.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.581
I know I love this town.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:32.168
I know I love everyone in it.

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.131
I love the lights
that we create...

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:41.135
...that shine so bright.

01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:44.430
I love you.

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.103
I love you, Ben.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:57.485
So is this where
you sweep me up to the rooftop,

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:59.737
and...

01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:01.447
plan on another kiss?

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:05.410
You can't plan
something like that.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:06.703
It just has to happen.

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:15.587
[♪♪♪]

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:25.388
Merry Christmas, Emma.

01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:27.265
Merry Christmas, Ben.

01:26:32.770 --> 01:26:37.358
