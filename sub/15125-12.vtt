WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:05.639
Almost ready!

00:05.673 --> 00:06.707
Can't wait!

00:06.740 --> 00:08.909
I'm really scared.
Me, too.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.711
My tongue is trembling.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.180
It's gotta be better

00:12.213 --> 00:14.315
than those baby duck
livers and snails.
(gags)

00:14.348 --> 00:17.351
Now, I know that I've had
some misfires in the past,

00:17.385 --> 00:20.388
but this time
I definitely made something

00:20.421 --> 00:22.656
that everyone will love:

00:22.690 --> 00:23.891
pizza!

00:23.924 --> 00:25.659
Yeah, I'm sure it'll
be great, honey.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.161
You can't mess up pizza.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.663
Lord knows the Hawaiians
really tried.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.233
I just added one little
ingredient from Iron Chef.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.667
Uh-oh.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.104
See if you guys can figure out

00:36.137 --> 00:38.106
what the secret ingredient is.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.673
Tar?
Fire?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.442
Magic marker?
Very close.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.177
Squid ink.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.213
I think I'd rather eat
the marker.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.781
I know that the coloring's
a little bit odd,

00:47.815 --> 00:49.450
but the judges on Iron Chef said

00:49.483 --> 00:51.018
that everything tastes better
with squid ink.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.521
Be sure to save
a little bit of room

00:53.554 --> 00:56.424
because there's squid ink
apple pie in the freezer.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.892
Don't you worry.
We are definitely
gonna save room.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.728
How's it taste, Maw Maw?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.630
I have no idea.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.898
My taste buds have been dead
for years.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.100
At this point, it's all about

01:06.134 --> 01:09.036
keeping the trains
running on time.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.905
See ya tomorrow, Mr. Pizza.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.814
These flowers smell
delicious, Sabrina.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.884
Burt, smell these.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.787
Mmm! Nothing smells
better than fresh-cut flowers.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.622
I struck out again, didn't I?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.090
(gargles)

01:30.124 --> 01:32.260
You're family, and we love you,

01:32.293 --> 01:36.164
but your food experiments
are sometimes just...

01:36.197 --> 01:37.565
a little hoity-toilety.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.066
You know what,
you guys?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.401
I just think you're being

01:40.434 --> 01:41.669
a little bit
closed-minded about this.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.672
I think you hear
the word squid ink

01:44.705 --> 01:46.740
and you just assume

01:46.774 --> 01:48.075
that somehow...

01:48.108 --> 01:50.911
That tastes like a fish
had a baby

01:50.944 --> 01:52.780
with a copy machine
in my mouth.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.114
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.683
I don't think
this is really that bad.

01:55.716 --> 01:59.119
(all laugh)

01:59.153 --> 02:01.522
Oh, sure, Jimmy gets
black all over his face,

02:01.555 --> 02:03.157
everybody laughs.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.859
I do it for Halloween,
and it's a town incident.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.962
* Whoo!

02:08.996 --> 02:13.567
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:17.338 --> 02:20.374
Oh, hey, Virginia.
Oh, wow, what's all that for?

02:20.408 --> 02:22.876
Oh, I'm making angel hair pasta
and hot dogs for dinner, mm-hmm.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.814
I call it my "Hair of the Dogs."
It's one of Burt's favorites.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.616
Yeah, I totally love that.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.451
I tried that once for a dinner
party, but instead of hot dogs,

02:30.484 --> 02:31.952
I got fancy and I used clams.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.887
Tell me you didn't call it
"Hair of the Clam."

02:33.921 --> 02:36.224
Yeah, I didn't really think
it through very well.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.858
You shouldn't start out

02:37.891 --> 02:40.194
all fancy schmancy with that
stuff you only see on TV.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.830
Yeah, it's just like
I'm flying blind here, you know?

02:42.863 --> 02:44.865
Growing up, the only thing
I ever saw my mother serve

02:44.898 --> 02:47.635
my father in the kitchen
were divorce papers. (laughs)

02:47.668 --> 02:49.537
Growing up, the only thing
that I ever saw

02:49.570 --> 02:51.672
get baked
in the kitchen was my mother.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.073
Growing up, the only thing
I ever say my mother do

02:53.106 --> 02:54.342
in the kitchen
was the pool boy.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.043
Growing up...
Sabrina...
Yeah?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.711
...do you want me to give
you some cooking lessons?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.680
Oh, my God, yeah.
Okay.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.189
Who the hell did that?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.662
(dog barking)

03:14.695 --> 03:17.331
We should all be proud
of our Sabrina.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.066
We practiced all yesterday,

03:19.099 --> 03:20.868
and this is her first solo

03:20.901 --> 03:24.538
attempt at my "Ashes
to Mashes, Dust to
Crust" casserole.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.873
And it is almost your recipe.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.575
I just had to make
one little change.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.077
Oh... you made a change?

03:30.110 --> 03:32.613
Yeah, I know I'm supposed to add
the chip droppings, but I...

03:32.646 --> 03:34.582
Dust. It's in the title.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.351
You use the dust
in the bottom of the bag.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.786
Right, but Jimmy likes

03:38.819 --> 03:40.187
to lick the chip dust out
of our chip bags,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.889
so I had
to improvise.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.891
Jimmy, please tell me you're
poking holes in those bags

03:43.924 --> 03:45.526
before you lick 'em.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.428
When Burt was younger,
he got his head stuck

03:47.461 --> 03:48.796
in a party-size chip bag
and almost died.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.631
I smelled barbecue
and saw a bright light.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.434
It was the scariest and most
delicious moment of my life.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.670
This is delicious.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.308
Wow. This kinda tastes
like food.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.776
I think this is even better
than Mom's.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.946
Really? Better?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.581
That's kind of a strong word,
don't you think?

04:07.615 --> 04:10.117
You know what else
is a strong word? Oak.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.420
Which is what I think this table
is made out of.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.655
Let's talk about oak
for a while.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.024
I gotta try
this amazing new recipe.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.727
Hmm. Different.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.795
I don't know
if I'd say "better."

04:21.829 --> 04:24.798
Mine did win grand prize at the
Natesville Hot Dish competition,

04:24.832 --> 04:26.099
which is sort of like

04:26.133 --> 04:28.235
the Nobel Peace Prize of food.
(laughs)

04:28.268 --> 04:29.670
Sabrina,
this is awesome.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.772
I think this is the best
casserole I've ever had.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.073
Maybe it's cedar.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.942
Cedar seems like a
solid table-making wood.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.844
Jimmy, it really is just
your mother's recipe,

04:36.877 --> 04:38.145
except for instead of chip dust,

04:38.178 --> 04:39.613
I just ground up
some old cereal.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.749
Oh, is that all you added?
Just cereal dust?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.751
Whatever she did, it's amazing.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.353
And I can't even
imagine how good

04:45.386 --> 04:48.356
it's gonna taste when I don't
have gum in my mouth.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.324
(Jimmy exclaims)

04:50.358 --> 04:52.926
No, it says right here, "pine."

04:52.960 --> 04:54.995
Boy, do I feel stupid.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.601
See? I told you I could carry
you all the way from home.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.536
That was fun.
We should do that more often.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.271
Save a ton of money on gas.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.674
Well, start carbo-loading
'cause you're my ride home.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.842
Hey, guess who I signed up
for the Hot Dish competition?

05:08.876 --> 05:10.711
Is it Michael Hunt?
'Cause they're on to that joke.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.347
No, no, no.
I signed Sabrina up.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.449
She's gonna carry on
the family tradition.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.150
Oak tree, ten o'clock.

05:17.184 --> 05:20.521
Burt, that's a cardboard tree
with elves making cookies.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.922
Is it?

05:26.527 --> 05:29.497
Barney, I'm coming out
of retirement. Sign me up.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.699
Oh, my. This is like when Rocky

05:31.732 --> 05:33.367
came out of retirement

05:33.401 --> 05:35.703
in Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V
and Rocky Balboa.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.304
Technically, he didn't
really come out

05:37.337 --> 05:38.639
of retirement in Rocky V.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.840
It was an unsanctioned
street fight.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.375
But I appreciate
your excitement.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.354
Mmm. Okay, that was interesting.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.224
Moist, chewy.

05:57.257 --> 06:00.327
I don't want to say soapy,
but it had a quality to it.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.097
Burt, you just took a bite out
of a sponge I left on the table.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.233
Hmm, better than I would
have thought.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.235
Here, let me feed
these to you.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.370
I made three casseroles.
Each one has

06:10.404 --> 06:12.205
a different
new ingredient.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.675
You have to tell me
which is the best one.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.209
Uh.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.111
Oh, this one's unbelievable.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.048
I don't think I'd call it
a casserole. I'd call it

06:21.081 --> 06:22.750
a kick-ass-erole.
What's the new ingredient?

06:22.783 --> 06:24.051
Oh, that's a secret.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.419
If I learned one thing
from Paula Deen

06:25.453 --> 06:27.187
it's to keep my mouth shut.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.057
You know, I was thinking we
should get away this weekend.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.892
I've always wondered what the
big fuss was about Des Moines.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.561
Are you crazy?
The Hot Dish competition

06:33.594 --> 06:35.295
is this weekend.
Oh, you know what?

06:35.328 --> 06:37.931
You're right. You're gonna have
to drop out of that.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.468
Hey, let's see what
the weather is in Des Moines.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.436
You're being weird.
I'm starting to think

06:42.470 --> 06:43.937
you don't want me
to be in this contest.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.606
Let's see, weather for Iowa

06:45.639 --> 06:49.242
this weekend is thundersnow.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.811
That should be interesting.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.613
Burt.
I'm behind you, Virginia.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.281
If you don't want
to be in this contest,

06:54.314 --> 06:55.382
don't be in this contest.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.950
I never said that!

06:56.984 --> 06:59.152
Virginia, why didn't you tell me
you were signing up

06:59.186 --> 07:00.621
for the Hot Dish competition?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.322
If you're in it, then
I'm just gonna drop out.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.792
Okay, than that's settled.
Who wants to watch Robocop?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.226
Nothing is settled.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.828
Sabrina, you're not dropping
out of the contest.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.263
But don't you think it's gonna
be a little bit weird

07:10.297 --> 07:12.265
if we're both going up
against each other?

07:12.299 --> 07:15.002
No! This isn't about trying
to win,

07:15.035 --> 07:18.772
it's about community
and everyone gets to taste
each other's food.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.307
It's just for fun.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.842
Like the Super Bowl.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.145
Okay, if you really don't mind,
then I'll do it.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.814
But here's the good news,

07:26.847 --> 07:28.248
I'm really not very
competitive, so...

07:28.281 --> 07:29.817
Oh, please.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.952
I'm, like, a hundred times
less competitive than you.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.697
What?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.332
What? I didn't
say anything.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.367
I know you, Burt.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.202
You only fake read when
something's bothering you.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.871
I'm not fake reading.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.641
I'm actually interested in...
debt ceilings. You think

07:53.674 --> 07:55.208
we should get one of those?

07:55.242 --> 07:58.278
We are not gonna buy
a ceiling that puts us
into debt.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.514
Now tell me what is
really bothering you,

08:00.548 --> 08:02.182
or it's torture-tickle time.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.717
Virginia, you're not gonna
be able to...

08:03.751 --> 08:06.119
It's nothing, really!
I was just wondering

08:06.153 --> 08:08.488
why you want to beat
Sabrina so bad!

08:09.723 --> 08:11.525
I don't need to beat her.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.061
Tickle torture works both ways.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.963
No! No!
Why?! Why?! Why?!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.731
Okay, fine!

08:17.765 --> 08:20.200
When Jimmy said
he liked her casserole
better than mine,

08:20.233 --> 08:22.169
a little piece
of my heart broke.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.071
I didn't hear
him say that.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.673
Yes, you did.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.708
Then you changed the subject,
started talking about oak.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.710
Oh, the oak tree.
The sturdiest of the hardwoods.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.679
Brother of the maple.
King of the forest.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.414
See? You're trying
to change the subject again.

08:34.447 --> 08:38.418
Look, I know I wasn't
the perfect mom,

08:38.451 --> 08:41.689
but the one thing
I always got right was cooking.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.824
Mommy, I tried
to steal

08:43.857 --> 08:46.493
the mouse's peanut butter again.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.096
I know what'll make you
feel better.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.165
Some of Mommy's hot dog
and macaroni casserole

08:52.199 --> 08:53.767
with spray cheese.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.407
Mom, I attacked this door
because

09:00.440 --> 09:03.176
Emily Wilson won't go
to the prom with me.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.847
Oh, honey, you don't want
to date a muffin top.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.850
You want a muffin
topped with dates.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.518
They're a lot sweeter
than Emily

09:11.551 --> 09:13.921
and they're not pregnant
with the gym teacher's baby.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.123
Bradley Wong
did it to me again.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.525
He can't have playdates
with Hope anymore.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.629
Aw, honey, sit down.
I made corn on the cobbler.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.031
My cooking was always there
for Jimmy.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.566
But now I'm afraid
he's not gonna be there

09:26.600 --> 09:28.368
for my cooking anymore.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.237
Well, Jimmy's still gonna
love your cooking.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.773
What does it matter what
a couple of judges think?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.541
Because once I win
that contest,

09:34.574 --> 09:37.544
Jimmy's gonna remember how happy
my food makes him.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.546
I just want Jimmy
to be happy.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.048
Why didn't you say so?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.450
All I want is for Jimmy
to be happy, too.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.722
Are you crazy?!
What was that for?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.457
Why would you tell Sabrina you
like her cooking better

09:50.490 --> 09:52.159
than your mom's in
front of your mom?!

09:52.192 --> 09:54.795
I was just being honest.
Ah! Could you stop doing that?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.797
I'm sorry, but you keep
opening your mouth

09:56.830 --> 09:58.265
and stupid stuff
keeps coming out.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.466
Okay, signing Sabrina up

09:59.499 --> 10:03.003
for the competition
was a dumb idea.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.673
I'm sorry. Ah!

10:05.706 --> 10:09.176
Never apologize to a man
who slapped you.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.448
What are you doing?

10:15.482 --> 10:17.651
You know that carny
with the milk bottle booth?

10:17.685 --> 10:21.321
He takes my money
every year, but this time

10:21.354 --> 10:23.657
I'm walking away
with that stuffed giraffe.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.459
You know, for a woman your age,
it seems a little petty

10:26.493 --> 10:29.262
and juvenile to obsess
over a stuffed giraffe.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.630
This isn't about the giraffe.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.632
It's about
good and evil.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.334
About the triumph
of the human spirit.

10:34.367 --> 10:38.205
Proving to society that
older people have value.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.808
Really?
No. It's about the giraffe.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.843
I know it's highly flammable,

10:42.876 --> 10:45.879
filled with shredded
Chinese newspaper,

10:45.913 --> 10:48.415
but damn it, I want it.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.957
Respect.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.826
And that's coming from the guy

10:58.859 --> 11:00.994
who has to clean that up.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.130
I just don't see any way
out of this, Jimmy.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.464
I know.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.833
There's no
possible solution.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.400
It's like
a crossword puzzle.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.837
Well, it's been great
spending holidays with you

11:09.870 --> 11:13.006
these past 25 years.
Farewell, son.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.342
Too bad there's not
someone good enough
to beat the both of them.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.011
That's exactly
what we need.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.379
A ringer!

11:19.412 --> 11:21.048
Hello.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.682
BURT:
Mom, Dad.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.352
This out of nowhere visit
is wildly unexpected.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.159
When was the last time
we saw you two?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.593
Oh, that's right.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.263
It was when you lied to Burt
about being Jewish

11:36.296 --> 11:37.865
and stole all his
Bar Mitzvah money.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.767
Virginia, dear,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.735
life's too short
to carry a grudge.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.670
Yep, if there's one
thing we've learned

11:43.703 --> 11:46.039
the week we were Jews,
is "always forget..."

11:46.073 --> 11:47.407
and hide your art.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.942
Oh, Burt, would you
help your father

11:48.976 --> 11:51.044
carry the electric mixer
in from the car?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.780
I've got to get busy
on my hot dish.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.081
VIRGINIA:
Wait...

11:54.114 --> 11:55.382
Hot dish?

11:55.415 --> 11:56.917
Are you here to enter
the competition?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.285
I'm not here
to enter it.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.320
I'm here to win it.
(laughs)

12:03.723 --> 12:06.093
Ow.
What was that for?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.061
That's for dragging your
mother and me into this.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.965
Oh, and for scratching
my Datsun 280Z
back in 1985.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.433
I know you did it.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.706
You know pitting
two females

12:19.739 --> 12:20.941
in the same family
against each other

12:20.974 --> 12:22.609
only leads
to trouble.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.311
It's not my fault.
Jimmy started
the whole thing.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.946
Oh...

12:25.979 --> 12:28.215
That's for blaming
other people.
I'm sorry.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.951
Never apologize to
a man who slapped you.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.620
Can I slap him back?
You can try.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.389
Well, as long
as Mom wins,

12:36.423 --> 12:37.624
everything
should be fine.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.492
Oh, that's easy
for you to say.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.594
You have no idea what
your mother makes me do

12:41.628 --> 12:43.063
for these
damn contests.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.597
Come on, Ralph.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.900
It's a mixer,
not a trip to
the bathroom.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.602
I expect you to go quicker
with less grunting.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.841
* My hot dish brings
all the boys to the yard *

12:53.874 --> 12:55.675
* And they're right,
it's better than yours *

12:55.708 --> 12:57.344
* Damn right,
it's better than yours *

12:57.377 --> 12:59.279
* I could teach you,
but I'd have to charge *

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
* My hot dish brings
all the boys to the yard *

13:01.314 --> 13:03.116
* And they're right,
it's better than yours *

13:03.150 --> 13:04.952
* Damn right,
it's better than yours *

13:04.985 --> 13:06.619
* I could teach you,
but I'd have to charge *

13:06.653 --> 13:08.989
* My hot dish brings all
the boys to the yard *

13:09.022 --> 13:10.790
* They're right,
it's better than yours... *

13:10.824 --> 13:13.126
* Damn right...
Ooh, Virginia.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.528
That is, hands down, the best
casserole you've ever made.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.364
That's your mother's.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.368
Best casserole... ever...

13:21.401 --> 13:23.536
to feed to our nation's enemies.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.038
Ship this off
to Europe

13:25.072 --> 13:26.806
and teach those
Italians a lesson.

13:29.242 --> 13:33.613
Welcome to the 2013
Radish Festival!

13:33.646 --> 13:36.049
*

13:36.083 --> 13:37.817
Step right up
for the ring toss...

13:37.851 --> 13:39.186
It's not whether you
come in first place

13:39.219 --> 13:40.687
or even second place.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.322
What's important is
that we're together

13:42.355 --> 13:44.191
and we make this the best
Radish Festival ever.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.658
I'm not gonna
lie to you, Burt.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.961
If I lose, I may
not take it well.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.030
As in, I may burn
Howdy's to the ground

13:50.063 --> 13:51.364
and dance
on its ashes.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.832
Figuratively.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.368
Wait, does that
mean "for real"?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.370
'Cause I mean
"for real."

14:07.047 --> 14:08.681
So that's why she
asked me for the roses.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.850
Burt!

14:10.884 --> 14:12.485
It's just a dumb
competition.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.187
Why does Jimmy
have to like your
cooking better?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.755
Isn't it enough
that I love your cooking?

14:15.788 --> 14:17.490
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about yesterday,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.759
with your mom's casserole?
Well, she's my mom.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.428
You're my husband.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.762
So if I'm
supposed to like

14:22.795 --> 14:24.431
your cooking better
than my mom's,

14:24.464 --> 14:25.565
shouldn't Jimmy like
Sabrina's better than yours?

14:25.598 --> 14:28.235
I... Great.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.103
In all your synopses,
nobody likes my cooking.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.838
Well, in all
your synopses,

14:31.871 --> 14:33.406
no one's allowed
to like anyone else's.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.375
I'm starting to think
this isn't about

14:35.408 --> 14:37.077
you being a good mom
to Jimmy at all.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.779
You just want
everyone to like
your cooking the best.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.114
No, that's not
it at all.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.116
Well...
(scoffs)

14:43.150 --> 14:45.218
Okay, fine,
that's exactly it.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.188
Okay, Barbara June.

14:48.221 --> 14:52.225
All your training
has come down to this.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.293
Is that an
energy drink?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.594
Sort of.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.396
It's a month's supply
of steroids

14:56.429 --> 14:57.764
for my arthritis.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.100
I may have a full beard
by the end of the day,

15:00.133 --> 15:03.403
but I'm going home
with that giraffe.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.276
Any word from
the judges?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.411
Nope. They're still
cleansing their palates

15:11.444 --> 15:13.813
from this morning's Guess What's
In That Sausage competition.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.482
Well, I really think
Sabrina has a shot.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.150
Her casserole
is unbelievable.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.957
Oh, my... oh, my...
oh, my God, that's disgusting.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.959
Ugh.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.496
Tastes like a dirty sock
filled with old cheesecake.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.000
I used to smuggle food
into fat camp.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.234
Come on, Barney.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.803
It was great yesterday.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.606
Oh, what happened?
This is awful.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.641
Ugh, sorry, James.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.176
I guess Sabrina's out.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.577
Well, at least Virginia
still has a chance.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.646
Oh, man.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.748
I bet Mom messed with
Sabrina's casserole.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.017
She's so competitive.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.452
Well, you know what?

15:52.485 --> 15:53.620
Just like solitaire,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.588
two can play
at this game.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.990
Oh, I didn't hear that.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.691
As a respected official
of this festival,

15:58.725 --> 16:00.427
I refuse to tarnish
my integrity.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.263
Now excuse me while I go
sell parched festival-goers

16:03.296 --> 16:05.065
$10 bottles
of tap water.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.943
What are
you doing?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.611
I know what you did
to Sabrina's casserole,

16:18.645 --> 16:20.380
and now I'm just
giving you a taste
of your own medicine.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.915
Before you do that,
why don't you
taste the medicine?

16:25.018 --> 16:26.219
Oh, it's horrible.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.887
Not the juice.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.356
My casserole.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.829
Oh, it's horrible!

16:36.863 --> 16:38.265
Why can't anyone cook anymore?

16:38.865 --> 16:40.367
Is it me?

16:40.400 --> 16:41.668
Maybe I went mouth-blind.
Can people go mouth-blind?

16:41.701 --> 16:42.902
There's nothing wrong

16:42.935 --> 16:44.904
with you
or my cooking.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.839
I tanked
the contest.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.141
Well, why would you do that?

16:48.175 --> 16:50.077
I've had the prize
for 25 years.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.878
It's Sabrina's turn.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.713
But someone ruined
her casserole.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.315
She's not gonna
win the contest.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.118
Winning the contest
isn't the prize, Jimmy.

16:59.886 --> 17:03.490
So if you didn't mess
with Sabrina's hot dish,

17:03.523 --> 17:04.757
then who did?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.659
BARNEY:
Attention, please!

17:06.693 --> 17:09.329
We have a winner
in the Hot Dish competition.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.830
Christine Chance

17:10.863 --> 17:13.200
and her Much Ado
About Stuffing Casserole!

17:13.233 --> 17:14.434
(cheering)

17:14.467 --> 17:15.535
Guess we know

17:15.568 --> 17:16.769
who messed with Sabrina's.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.707
Well, honey,
you and Sabrina

17:20.740 --> 17:22.375
did an amazing job.
What can you do?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.277
Grandma's a cheater.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.214
Look, Grandpa's paying
off the judges right now.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.151
He's my dad.
I'll take care of this.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.523
What...?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.558
Casserole coming up.
Casserole coming up.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.131
Dad!

17:44.164 --> 17:45.398
You've made
a terrible mistake.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.400
That is not my mother!

17:47.434 --> 17:49.302
Settle down, Burt.
It's not what you think.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.803
I was doing this
for your mother.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.439
I don't see how lip-wrestling
with the editor

17:52.472 --> 17:53.873
of Casserole Today
could be for her.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.575
See, I throw the judges
a little sugar

17:55.608 --> 17:57.210
so your mother wins.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.479
I think she'd prefer you kept
your sugar to yourself.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.414
No, I wouldn't.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.383
It was my idea.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.984
It certainly
wasn't mine.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.086
That judge had
been tasting hot
dishes for an hour.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.921
Like making out
with 14 layers

18:08.955 --> 18:10.490
of cheese, beef
and mayonnaise.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.924
You two are sick.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.126
Don't be naive.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.294
It's the way
the world works, Burt.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.995
Elections,
casting couches,

18:16.028 --> 18:18.398
local casserole
competitions...

18:18.431 --> 18:20.633
How do you think
you made the team
in Little League?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.769
You couldn't make it
to second base,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.003
so your father had to.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.740
But...

18:27.774 --> 18:32.412
Like I said to Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar in '78,

18:32.445 --> 18:34.514
you're coming
home with me,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.649
you tall freak.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.785
Back again!

18:38.818 --> 18:40.853
Never seem to learn,
do you?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.955
Shut your pie hole,
you filthy carny,

18:42.989 --> 18:45.325
and give me some balls.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.961
We go by "carnival
game technician" now.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.197
Whatever.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.764
I'll make it quick,

18:51.798 --> 18:53.866
so you can get back to
mouth-kissing your cousin.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.307
Take 'em down,
Barbara June.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.652
You got the heat.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.454
You just got to bring it
a little lower.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.523
Something I also said to Kareem.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.325
But I've got
a problem.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.992
I can't move my arm.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.161
I've seen this kind
of dislocation before.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.831
I'm pretty sure I
can pop it back in.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.300
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Actually,

19:27.334 --> 19:29.236
I think
it's a torn rotator cuff.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.171
And I'm almost certain
I just made it worse.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.873
You got to throw for me, Frank.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.808
I got to have that giraffe.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.076
I can't throw.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.077
What the hell's the problem?

19:38.110 --> 19:39.746
Throw the ball, you wuss.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.025
(grunting)

19:55.928 --> 19:58.130
Run!
Oh!

20:02.034 --> 20:04.604
(gasping)

20:06.072 --> 20:08.508
(grunting)

20:08.541 --> 20:10.076
Suck it, homey!

20:10.109 --> 20:12.845
(bystanders muttering)

20:12.879 --> 20:15.582
Well, my parents didn't ruin
Sabrina's casserole, but...

20:15.615 --> 20:18.117
I finally realized how I won
that high school essay contest

20:18.150 --> 20:20.019
with a hand-drawn
picture of boobs.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.888
Well, if Grandma didn't mess
with Sabrina's casserole,

20:21.921 --> 20:23.456
then who did?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.525
(sighs)
Guys,

20:25.558 --> 20:27.760
I ruined my own casserole.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.862
Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.131
I knew how much winning this
competition meant to you.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.566
You didn't have to do that.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.101
The only reason
I entered this contest

20:35.134 --> 20:38.237
was to make you proud,
not step on your toes.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.572
The only reason
I entered the contest

20:39.606 --> 20:41.408
was to destroy you
in front of Jimmy.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.243
How did our good intentions
go so wrong?

20:49.349 --> 20:52.051
Aw.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.986
JIMMY:
Hey, Mom,

20:54.020 --> 20:56.055
maybe you can teach
Sabrina some more recipes.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.090
She sure did a great
job with that last one.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.727
I love that idea. Now that I've
learned how to make a casserole,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.261
I'd love to try
some other new things.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.397
Wilfred and I liked
to try new things:

21:04.431 --> 21:07.634
opium, group sex, tiramisu.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.470
Winning the Hot Dish really
sparked my competitive fires.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.839
I'm gonna enter
the Camden County Muffin Contest

21:12.872 --> 21:16.108
in a few weeks.
Oh, I've heard about that.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.811
I think they have
all male judges.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.413
Oh, dear Lord.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.014
(others laugh)

21:22.982 --> 21:24.417
All right, Maw Maw.

21:24.451 --> 21:29.789
(speaking indistinctly)

21:29.822 --> 21:31.023
(ship's horn blows)

21:31.057 --> 21:32.859
They fix it.
