WEBVTT

00:01.236 --> 00:03.956
Speech! Speech!

00:04.070 --> 00:05.592
- Okay, okay, okay. Settle down.
- _

00:05.617 --> 00:06.817
Um...

00:06.885 --> 00:08.385
It's hard to believe I'm 50.

00:08.487 --> 00:10.787
A-A-As of today, I'm middle-aged.

00:10.856 --> 00:12.322
What's he been the last 10 years?

00:12.424 --> 00:14.457
Delusional.
He thinks he's a millennial, like us.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.526
I've thought a lot about what's next.

00:16.628 --> 00:18.720
- 51.
- Thank you, buddy.

00:18.805 --> 00:21.172
And it's important
that I continue to grow

00:21.274 --> 00:24.175
and that I stay mentally challenged.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.323
Which is why I am starting...

00:27.425 --> 00:28.758
piano lessons,

00:28.827 --> 00:30.126
so that by next year's birthday,

00:30.195 --> 00:32.494
I'll be good enough
to perform in public.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.297
Oh, great. Another thing to go to.

00:34.399 --> 00:37.133
Also, I'm gonna learn
how to speak Spanish.

00:37.202 --> 00:38.768
Excelente!

00:38.837 --> 00:41.270
Uh, I... I haven't started yet.

00:41.339 --> 00:43.105
Um, and finally, um...

00:43.174 --> 00:46.175
and I know it's a little bit
of a midlife-crisis cliché,

00:46.244 --> 00:47.477
but...

00:47.545 --> 00:50.413
I'm gonna learn
how to ride a unicycle!

00:51.583 --> 00:54.083
Phil, you forgot to open
one of your gifts.

00:54.152 --> 00:55.161
Ooh!

00:55.253 --> 00:59.097
This one,
Jay picked it up for you himself.

00:59.122 --> 01:00.054
He did?

01:00.056 --> 01:01.088
Hey, Dad.

01:01.157 --> 01:02.423
So, what's going on with that hat?

01:02.492 --> 01:04.825
Gloria thinks I look grumpy
in the photos that we take

01:04.927 --> 01:06.227
when we go to these things,

01:06.296 --> 01:08.367
so I'm searching for the right hat

01:08.392 --> 01:09.895
that makes me look like I'm having fun.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.956
Or you could just smile more.

01:11.981 --> 01:14.148
- Eh.
- Wow!

01:14.217 --> 01:15.804
"The Sommelier's Guide

01:15.816 --> 01:17.615
- "to the Wines of France."
- Ooh!

01:17.654 --> 01:19.987
- I love it so much.
- Nice!

01:20.089 --> 01:22.056
Oh, my goodness. It's inscribed.

01:23.393 --> 01:25.156
"May you continue to age

01:25.181 --> 01:28.181
as gracefully as a fine Bordeaux."

01:28.585 --> 01:31.569
"Happy Birthday, Jay. Love, Cam."

01:31.594 --> 01:35.129
- Cam. Yeah. Jay, you re-gifted my gift?
- Dad!

01:35.231 --> 01:37.331
- I didn't know he wrote in it.
- Because you didn't open it.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.799
So now I feel like a jerk.

01:38.868 --> 01:40.801
How could you be a jerk?
You're wearing that hat.

01:41.010 --> 01:46.102
_

01:46.342 --> 01:48.075
A year from now,
I'm gonna know what that means.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.625 --> 02:03.080
I got Gloria the greatest
Valentine's Day gift...

02:03.160 --> 02:07.528
a box set of DVDs of all
the Dean Martin Roasts.

02:07.630 --> 02:10.476
I was so moved by the romantic gesture

02:10.501 --> 02:12.000
that for Jay's birthday,

02:12.102 --> 02:15.470
I invited a bunch of
people over to insult him.

02:17.207 --> 02:18.773
So, my ex-wife and I,

02:18.876 --> 02:21.276
we were on vacation with Jay and Gloria.

02:21.378 --> 02:23.144
They're walking down the beach,
and my ex-wife says,

02:23.247 --> 02:25.814
"Whoa, look at all that skin."

02:25.916 --> 02:27.505
And I said, "Baby, come on."

02:27.505 --> 02:28.514
"What's wrong with that?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.940
She's a beautiful woman in a bikini."

02:31.042 --> 02:33.542
She said, "Oh,
I'm talkin' about Jay's scalp."

02:38.516 --> 02:40.983
Jay is so not Latin

02:41.085 --> 02:43.319
that every time that he dances,

02:43.421 --> 02:45.754
people point him to the bathroom.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.658
He has no rhythm. That's what I mean.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.995
But seriously, I love the whites.

02:53.097 --> 02:55.531
No, but seriously,
Jay is quite the environmentalist.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.133
Just this last year,
he recycled a gift of mine...

02:58.236 --> 03:00.002
a wonderful book about wine.

03:03.608 --> 03:05.474
I-I don't want to say my father is old,

03:05.576 --> 03:08.777
but he remembers panicking at Y-1-K.

03:11.048 --> 03:13.048
My dad is old.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.050
How old is he?

03:15.152 --> 03:17.219
He's so old that when
he started using it,

03:17.321 --> 03:19.054
it was called Preparation G.

03:21.559 --> 03:22.625
Enough!

03:22.727 --> 03:24.159
This is terrible!

03:24.262 --> 03:27.263
I don't know why any of you
people think this is funny!

03:27.365 --> 03:31.433
You may think these are jokes,
but it's way too real.

03:31.535 --> 03:35.204
We need to respect Grandpa
instead of cutting him down.

03:35.306 --> 03:38.707
None of us really knows
how much time he has left.

03:38.809 --> 03:40.876
Do you really want these to
be the last words he hears?

03:40.978 --> 03:42.945
Well, now I feel like hell.

03:43.047 --> 03:45.447
And that's how you roast! Bam!

03:48.986 --> 03:51.387
I don't understand why
adults make such a big deal

03:51.489 --> 03:52.554
about their birthdays.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.490
So this year, I asked for nothing.

03:54.592 --> 03:57.326
No party, no fuss.

03:57.428 --> 03:59.395
Just a quiet night by myself,

03:59.497 --> 04:02.031
with my thoughts, all alone.

04:04.235 --> 04:05.300
Okay.

04:05.303 --> 04:07.770
Just as I had hoped,
Mitchell is miserable.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.038
He said he didn't want a party,

04:09.140 --> 04:11.273
but it's like when you write
"No gifts" on an invitation

04:11.375 --> 04:12.908
but you secretly want
everyone to bring something

04:13.010 --> 04:14.042
big and expensive, Jotham.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.011
I made a heartfelt toast at your party.

04:16.113 --> 04:18.279
Yes, and those 12 words
were just as generous

04:18.382 --> 04:20.783
as the actual physical
gifts everyone else brought.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.518
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

04:22.620 --> 04:25.154
When you hear me say
"Mitchell, you're not alone,"

04:25.256 --> 04:27.690
that's when you come in
and you yell "Surprise."

04:27.792 --> 04:29.158
We know what to say.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.393
Mm. Do you?

04:32.463 --> 04:33.662
Hey!

04:33.764 --> 04:36.098
- How you doing? Okay?
- Yeah.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.367
Now do you see what it's like
to spend your birthday alone?

04:38.469 --> 04:40.202
I do. And it's...

04:40.304 --> 04:41.370
- Yeah.
- ...amazing.

04:41.372 --> 04:43.138
- What?
- Cam, thank you. Thank you.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.974
For once, you heard me and
gave me exactly what I wanted

04:46.077 --> 04:48.177
instead of what you
thought I should want.

04:48.279 --> 04:50.346
Honey, this is the best
birthday present ever.

04:50.448 --> 04:52.348
- It is?
- Yes!

04:52.450 --> 04:54.149
Oh, and you've...
you've got to be relieved, too.

04:54.251 --> 04:55.918
I mean, every time
we hang out with our friends,

04:56.020 --> 04:57.960
they leave and you spend
the rest of the night

04:57.985 --> 05:00.244
complaining about how every
single one of them annoys you.

05:00.269 --> 05:01.831
I don't know what you're talking about!

05:01.831 --> 05:04.731
Oh, please. Jotham's cheap.
L'Michael has bad breath.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.133
That doesn't sound like me!

05:06.235 --> 05:08.202
Antonio's weave is falling apart.

05:08.304 --> 05:09.903
Vincent's a sloppy drunk.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.371
Oh, oh, Jeffrey won't stop telling

05:11.474 --> 05:13.140
his one Bernadette Peters story.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.409
You're the sloppy drunk!

05:16.579 --> 05:18.011
Surprise!

05:20.349 --> 05:21.882
Here's a thing I realized...

05:21.984 --> 05:24.852
You can't get older if
you never have birthdays.

05:30.593 --> 05:32.693
♪ Happy birth... ♪

05:35.664 --> 05:38.098
- What'd I tell you?
- I thought this would be the year.

05:38.531 --> 05:40.297
I told my family I just
wanted my birthday

05:40.366 --> 05:42.366
to be me and Dylan this year
because at the time,

05:42.468 --> 05:44.201
I was still keeping
my pregnancy a secret,

05:44.270 --> 05:45.803
and I knew they'd get all suspicious

05:45.872 --> 05:46.904
about why I wasn't drinking.

05:47.262 --> 05:48.461
What was I going to say?

05:48.530 --> 05:49.896
"I can't drink because
I have work in the morning"?

05:51.099 --> 05:52.865
There's no way they'd believe that.

05:54.135 --> 05:55.401
Here. I got you a present.

05:55.503 --> 05:56.903
Ooh! Thank you!

05:58.373 --> 05:59.605
Get out!

05:59.707 --> 06:00.973
Gucci baby sneakers!

06:02.810 --> 06:04.377
They're adorable.

06:04.479 --> 06:06.445
Our baby's gonna be so hot.

06:06.514 --> 06:07.713
Personally, I think it's weird

06:07.815 --> 06:09.582
that there are shoes for
someone who can't walk.

06:09.684 --> 06:13.386
But you know what, Haley?
I love that we're pregnannnt...

06:14.355 --> 06:16.389
- Hello!
- Hi!

06:16.457 --> 06:17.950
What are you guys doing here?

06:17.975 --> 06:19.208
At the restaurant? We got a...

06:19.277 --> 06:20.543
- We got a Groupon, but we...
- Us too.

06:20.645 --> 06:22.278
Yeah, we j...
we just saw that you were over here.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.046
- Wanted to say happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

06:24.115 --> 06:25.381
Didn't mean to overhear.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.482
You didn't overhear anything.

06:26.484 --> 06:28.366
We were talking about a TV show.

06:28.391 --> 06:29.557
Oh, well, then, what's... what's up

06:29.659 --> 06:30.792
with these little baby shoes, then?

06:30.861 --> 06:32.427
These are... These are not baby shoes.

06:32.496 --> 06:33.661
- Oh.
- No, they're, um...

06:33.764 --> 06:35.196
We are starting a business

06:35.265 --> 06:38.767
for people who cannot afford
full-size designer wear.

06:38.869 --> 06:41.936
Oh. Well, as much as that
does sound like you, I...

06:42.038 --> 06:43.271
Okay.

06:44.241 --> 06:45.774
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, my God.

06:45.876 --> 06:46.908
That's exciting!

06:47.010 --> 06:48.843
- Is it?
- We think so.

06:49.161 --> 06:50.527
But we have not told my parents yet,

06:50.596 --> 06:52.062
so please don't say anything.

06:52.164 --> 06:54.465
Oh, honey,
I could keep your secret forever,

06:54.567 --> 06:56.433
but just so you know, he can't.

06:56.535 --> 06:57.568
Yeah, I'm weak.

06:57.570 --> 06:59.269
Yeah, you got maybe three,
four days tops.

06:59.372 --> 07:00.771
- What?
- Yeah.

07:00.873 --> 07:02.873
Oh. Okay.
Well, these were from us, but...

07:02.975 --> 07:04.208
Yeah, she can't have it. She's pregnant.

07:04.310 --> 07:06.143
Okay, there you go. See?

07:06.245 --> 07:07.344
Now, you listen to me.

07:07.446 --> 07:08.612
My roller-coastering hormones

07:08.714 --> 07:10.581
cannot handle another lecture
from my mother right now,

07:10.683 --> 07:11.915
so you are going to tell me a secret

07:12.018 --> 07:15.919
that I will reveal to everyone
if you ever spill mine!

07:16.022 --> 07:17.621
- Yeah, but I don't have any secrets.
- Mm?

07:17.723 --> 07:19.623
Uh,
when he dresses as Fizbo,

07:19.725 --> 07:21.859
he puts the makeup everywhere.

07:21.961 --> 07:24.214
- Mm. You're the best.
- Mm-hmm.

07:26.009 --> 07:27.710
Because of the whole 21 thing,

07:27.712 --> 07:29.981
people don't think
turning 20 is a big deal.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.710
But it's all I've been thinking about

07:32.745 --> 07:34.430
for the last three years.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.049
Hey.

07:38.364 --> 07:40.097
Three years ago, I came in here,

07:40.132 --> 07:42.687
and when I saw you, I fell in love.

07:43.031 --> 07:45.192
The kind of love that
punches you in the gut

07:45.217 --> 07:47.218
and makes you wanna be a better man.

07:47.243 --> 07:49.603
But when I asked you out,
you said, "Sorry, kid.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.238
You're cute,
but I don't date teenagers."

07:52.339 --> 07:54.573
Well... check it out.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.242
Oh! Happy birthday!

07:56.718 --> 07:57.910
But now I don't date men.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.344
Oh.

08:00.854 --> 08:03.789
Well... looks like
I've got a decision to make.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.283
On <i>my</i> birthday this year,

08:07.283 --> 08:10.018
I really got a sense of
what people think of me.

08:10.119 --> 08:11.320
Which is...

08:11.421 --> 08:12.654
so great.

08:12.755 --> 08:14.283
This is from me and the boys.

08:14.364 --> 08:15.898
Gloria got you her own gift.

08:16.627 --> 08:18.967
Wow, this is wrapped so nicely!

08:19.068 --> 08:20.135
<i>I</i> did that.

08:20.136 --> 08:22.144
It's a lost art in this modern age

08:22.169 --> 08:24.670
where people simply click and
ship gifts over the Internet.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.372
Papi, just be normal.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.674
Let's see. It is, uh...

08:28.776 --> 08:30.276
some kind of silk pillow?

08:30.377 --> 08:31.377
Well, it's more than that.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.578
See, there's a switch on the side,

08:33.679 --> 08:36.282
and when you lay on it, it...
it plays ocean sounds for you.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.784
You know, i-it helps you relax.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.486
- Huh.
- At least it's not a re-gift.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.888
- How do you live with this?
- I...

08:41.989 --> 08:43.690
Tell you what.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.665
How about we do <i>one</i> more gift, and then

08:45.690 --> 08:47.457
- we take a break for cake and do the rest after?
- Yeah.

08:47.558 --> 08:48.559
Hmm?

08:48.645 --> 08:50.927
Here, Mrs. Dunphy.
This is from me and Haley.

08:51.028 --> 08:52.262
Mm, thank you, Dylan.

08:52.363 --> 08:53.496
Although I have to say,

08:53.598 --> 08:56.276
you have given me enough
gifts this year already.

08:56.276 --> 08:58.811
Again, I'm very sorry about
impregnating your daughter.

08:58.912 --> 09:01.046
Yeah.

09:02.091 --> 09:03.201
What is this?

09:03.201 --> 09:04.501
It's an aromatherapy machine.

09:04.602 --> 09:06.217
See, you put in oils that
are supposed to help you

09:06.218 --> 09:07.435
with the stress of the day.

09:07.535 --> 09:08.552
Oh!

09:08.623 --> 09:10.499
Alright, well... let's see.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.136
So far, I have gotten a spa day,

09:13.236 --> 09:14.519
three massages,

09:14.619 --> 09:17.485
a meditation class, an ocean pillow,

09:17.585 --> 09:19.824
a rage bat, and a little machine

09:19.924 --> 09:22.226
that's supposed to trick my
nose into calming me down.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.634
Why does everyone think I'm so tense?

09:23.734 --> 09:25.347
You bit through your night guard.

09:25.447 --> 09:27.621
You're squeezing me too hard.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.696
And last week,
you made the pharmacist cry.

09:29.796 --> 09:32.347
That's because he wouldn't
sell me any more Sudafed.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.755
The entire family was sick.

09:33.855 --> 09:35.370
I was not cooking meth.

09:35.470 --> 09:37.572
You know what? I don't even want cake.

09:37.572 --> 09:39.581
I really don't appreciate
being criticized like this,

09:39.680 --> 09:40.964
especially on my birthday.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.093
Um, that's my gift. Open later.

09:48.344 --> 09:50.252
Manny and I share a birthday,

09:50.252 --> 09:52.821
so I always do something
big to get attention.

09:52.921 --> 09:54.420
Look! No hands!

09:54.425 --> 09:56.775
- Way to go, kid!
- Bravo, papi!

09:56.875 --> 09:58.785
Hey, guys! Check it out.

09:58.884 --> 10:01.240
Unicycling to my piano lesson.

10:01.265 --> 10:03.603
Wow! We're so proud of you!

10:03.703 --> 10:04.708
Now, <i>that's</i> impressive.

10:04.758 --> 10:06.832
Happy birthday, Joe!

10:06.932 --> 10:08.974
It <i>was!</i>

10:09.074 --> 10:10.655
It goes without saying

10:10.755 --> 10:12.598
I'm the best performer in the family.

10:12.698 --> 10:15.300
This year, for my birthday,
I decided to have a talent show

10:15.400 --> 10:17.112
so they all start saying it.

10:17.213 --> 10:18.727
Wait.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.787
It's a talent show?
I-I didn't know that.

10:20.812 --> 10:22.345
It said so on the invitation.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.072
- Mitchell?
- I only skimmed it.

10:24.172 --> 10:25.180
This is a disaster.

10:25.259 --> 10:27.005

Uncle Grumpy, why are you so angry?

10:40.999 --> 10:45.001
Because the
President wants to build a wall!

10:45.026 --> 10:47.234
Ay, yeah, that is very sad.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.518
Sad for <i>me,</i>

No, I taught her to go for the gun.

since I saw that creepy film.

11:28.301 --> 11:29.585
Wait. What was it called, again?

As you all know, Sherry and I met

12:06.363 --> 12:08.932
and fell for each other
over our love of improv.

12:09.032 --> 12:12.187
So, we're at a romantic restaurant.

12:12.212 --> 12:13.397
Okay.

12:15.545 --> 12:17.389
That dinner was delicious.

12:17.489 --> 12:19.531
I can't believe you chose this place.

12:19.631 --> 12:21.920
The chef is my ex-boyfriend.

12:21.945 --> 12:23.130
The crazy one?

12:23.230 --> 12:24.997
Yes. He's very jealous,

12:24.997 --> 12:26.939
and I'm scared he did
something to your food.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.125
Oh. Eh...

12:28.226 --> 12:30.039
I <i>am</i> feeling a little funny.

12:30.064 --> 12:31.480
I wish <i>this</i> were a little funny.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.733
Ooh. Ha. Okay. Oh, boy.

12:33.758 --> 12:34.653
Whew!

12:34.653 --> 12:36.102
I-Is this room spinning? I...

12:36.202 --> 12:38.409
- No.
- I was afraid of that.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.682
Well, then I better do
this before it's too late.

12:41.968 --> 12:43.285
And this part is real.

12:43.385 --> 12:45.130
Sherry Shaker,

12:45.229 --> 12:47.402
I used to be a one-man show,

12:47.427 --> 12:49.512
and then you entered from stage left,

12:49.512 --> 12:51.060
and I fell in love.

12:51.449 --> 12:53.208
I want you

12:53.300 --> 12:55.549
to be my scene partner forever.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.258
Darling, let's force
our friends to sit through

12:59.283 --> 13:01.020
the rest of our lives together.

13:03.603 --> 13:04.663
Will you marry me?

13:04.673 --> 13:05.783
Oh, my God.

13:07.590 --> 13:08.651
Manny!

13:09.474 --> 13:10.902
No!

13:11.418 --> 13:13.394
Why would you do this?!

13:18.330 --> 13:20.806
You gotta be feeling better
about that piano.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.433
I'd rather not talk about
my birthday this year.

13:27.434 --> 13:31.611
♪ Happy birthday, dear Lily ♪

13:31.644 --> 13:35.547
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

13:35.616 --> 13:37.817
I still can't
believe Sherry said no

13:37.842 --> 13:39.198
and broke up with me.

13:39.198 --> 13:40.765
What does he expect?
He's 20 years old.

13:40.866 --> 13:43.373
He proposed in front of his
family at a pretend restaurant.

13:43.373 --> 13:45.274
Whatever happened to "Yes and"?

13:45.299 --> 13:46.532
Jay,
I've tried everything.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.168
Please say something to him
that will make him feel better.

13:49.269 --> 13:50.409
Fine.

13:50.771 --> 13:52.505
Kid, let it go.

13:52.557 --> 13:54.024
It was four days ago.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.259
Alright, let's make a wish!

13:56.490 --> 13:57.757
I wish I were dead.

13:58.859 --> 13:59.859
Alright.

14:00.558 --> 14:01.628
There we go.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.777
Haley and I have had this plan for years

14:05.778 --> 14:08.613
that when I turn 21,
we'd hit the bars together.

14:08.714 --> 14:11.549
But since she's pregnant,
I was drinking for two.

14:12.551 --> 14:13.952
Technically, four.

14:16.869 --> 14:19.270
Lemme tell you something, Haley Dunphy.

14:19.372 --> 14:21.606
Do you know how much I admire you?

14:21.707 --> 14:22.741
Do you?

14:23.134 --> 14:24.968
So much!

14:25.069 --> 14:27.416
While I was working my butt off,

14:27.416 --> 14:29.345
you were out there having fun!

14:29.370 --> 14:30.904
Not worrying about <i>anything...</i>

14:31.005 --> 14:33.307
not school, not work...

14:33.408 --> 14:34.875
not condoms.

14:34.976 --> 14:37.316
Look at you... all preg-a-nant.

14:38.416 --> 14:40.084
Maybe I should have Bill
come get <i>me</i> pregnant.

14:40.185 --> 14:41.218
Ooh.

14:41.219 --> 14:43.754
Then we can be pregnant together!
That would be fun!

14:43.755 --> 14:45.322
Where's my phone?

14:45.423 --> 14:48.149
I'm gonna text him to
come get me pregnant.

14:48.174 --> 14:49.407
You know what?

14:49.509 --> 14:51.135
It's 2000-something.

14:51.144 --> 14:53.178
I'm gonna get <i>him</i> pregnant!

14:53.562 --> 14:55.246
I miss drinking.

14:55.515 --> 14:58.001
Unlike <i>some</i> people, I love my birthday.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.734
It's the one day a year
that can be all about <i>me.</i>

15:03.804 --> 15:04.818
Oh, yeah. Um, um...

15:04.917 --> 15:06.650
So, um, I thought it would be fun

15:06.749 --> 15:08.155
if we all went around the room

15:08.254 --> 15:09.855
and say what we love about Cam.

15:09.880 --> 15:10.885
- Oh!
- Yeah.

15:10.985 --> 15:13.282
Well, that's out of nowhere,
but if you insist.

15:13.381 --> 15:14.372
Haley, why don't you go first?

15:14.372 --> 15:15.378
Oh, me? Okay.

15:15.477 --> 15:18.243
Well, um... I love Uncle Cam

15:18.268 --> 15:20.427
because he is fun and
dresses with flair.

15:20.527 --> 15:21.638
Oh, my gosh.

15:22.719 --> 15:24.157
And, uh, I love

15:24.256 --> 15:25.498
that he makes my Uncle Mitchell happy.

15:25.498 --> 15:26.905
- Awww!
- Ohh!

15:27.004 --> 15:28.567
Oh, also, I love that you guys
were the first ones

15:28.592 --> 15:31.408
to find out I was pregnant
and you never judged me.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.514
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

15:33.539 --> 15:35.225
I thought we all found
out at the same time.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.500
Oh,... Well...

15:36.600 --> 15:38.828
Mitchell, you knew she was
pregnant and you didn't tell me?

15:38.853 --> 15:40.304
I didn't think it was my place.

15:40.304 --> 15:42.184
Anyway, who's next?

15:42.209 --> 15:43.713
"What I love about Cam is..."

15:43.813 --> 15:46.166
I just wish you would
have my back just once.

15:46.191 --> 15:48.070
I don't think she's been using my gift.

15:48.070 --> 15:50.226
- ♪ Happy birthday to Cam, happy... ♪
- Stop. Drop it.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.456
Welcome to <i>my</i> world.

15:51.497 --> 15:54.056
At <i>my</i> birthday,
all anyone cared about was weepy Manny

15:54.091 --> 15:55.365
'cause Sherry broke up with him.

15:56.654 --> 15:58.395
She has a boyfriend now.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.102
Way to go, Lily. Way to go!

16:02.478 --> 16:04.211
_

16:12.819 --> 16:14.846
How old are you?

16:14.945 --> 16:17.889
I turn 51 in, uh...

16:18.747 --> 16:20.218
this many days.

16:20.317 --> 16:21.285
Ugh.

16:21.285 --> 16:23.541
<i>My</i> dad had a midlife crisis, too.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.177
I have a hamster at his condo.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.108
No. N-No midlife crisis.

16:27.207 --> 16:29.901
I just think you're...
you're never too old to learn.

16:31.529 --> 16:33.230
Just stay away from my mom.

16:33.329 --> 16:35.062
She has a thing for losers.

16:38.106 --> 16:40.363
Are you okay?
Should we take you to the hospital?

16:40.462 --> 16:42.692
Yeah, the contractions are
getting closer together.

16:42.717 --> 16:44.353
No. Dad is next.

16:44.452 --> 16:46.447
I can hold it for a few minutes, okay?

16:46.546 --> 16:48.247
I don't want to screw this up for him.

16:53.484 --> 16:56.428
Yikes. Hate to follow that.

16:56.527 --> 16:58.293
What are <i>you</i> gonna dazzle us with?

16:58.648 --> 16:59.825
"Für Elise".

16:59.924 --> 17:02.378
In which key... "B" obvious?

17:02.477 --> 17:06.108
Next up,
the only student of mine who shaves.

17:06.207 --> 17:08.202
Phillip Dunphy.

17:14.846 --> 17:15.895
Um...

17:17.496 --> 17:20.493
When I turned 50,
I vowed to do some things

17:20.519 --> 17:22.220
to take me out of my comfort zone

17:22.319 --> 17:24.576
and keep me on my toes,
and I want to thank my family

17:25.366 --> 17:27.951
- for being my biggest cheerleaders.
- Oooooaaaaaah!

17:28.050 --> 17:29.260
I love you, too, honey.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.486
No, Haley's going into labor!

17:30.487 --> 17:31.787
We've got to get her
to the hospital, honey!

17:31.887 --> 17:32.998
- Oh!
- I tried to hold it! I'm sorry, Dad!

17:33.099 --> 17:34.962
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, everyone!

17:35.062 --> 17:36.567
Convenient.

17:51.039 --> 17:52.459
Yes! Great! Come on!

17:52.494 --> 17:53.836
Great work, honey.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.823
Tell your mom I say hi.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.457
- Dylan!
- Is everything okay?

18:03.701 --> 18:04.714
No.

18:06.155 --> 18:07.594
Everything's amazing.

18:08.059 --> 18:09.661
Why would you say it that way?

18:09.760 --> 18:11.035
Haley's fine.

18:11.134 --> 18:12.540
She was so brave.

18:12.639 --> 18:14.340
And the babies are great!

18:14.439 --> 18:16.075
I can't wait to see them!

18:16.174 --> 18:17.579
As soon as they're done
getting checked out.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.790
I'm gonna go get them now.

18:19.026 --> 18:21.316
Wait, wait. What about the sex?

18:21.415 --> 18:23.214
Doctor says not for six weeks.

18:26.462 --> 18:27.599
Is this the Dunphy suite?

18:28.679 --> 18:30.937
Oh, how's the mommy?

18:31.270 --> 18:33.429
Hand sanitizer, everyone. Here you go.

18:33.528 --> 18:34.508
How you doing, kiddo?

18:34.607 --> 18:36.636
A little tired. I overdid it last night.

18:36.735 --> 18:38.827
I don't think he
was talking to you, buddy.

18:38.926 --> 18:40.137
It's overwhelming.

18:40.236 --> 18:42.209
Just feeling so many different emotions.

18:42.234 --> 18:43.805
I'm also doing great.

18:43.805 --> 18:45.996
I have a son and a daughter,

18:46.095 --> 18:48.701
and once they washed them off,
they were really cute.

18:48.726 --> 18:49.390
Aww!

18:49.390 --> 18:50.680
Oh, what are their names?

18:50.680 --> 18:53.526
We're gonna put a pin in that
until the drugs wear off.

18:53.625 --> 18:56.994
Nobody needs grandchildren
named Pixar and Coachella.

18:57.029 --> 18:59.860
- Ooh.
- Phil, this is for you.

18:59.885 --> 19:02.665
It's a... little early birthday present.

19:02.765 --> 19:05.709
And I admit, this one is a re-gift.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.799
- "World's Best Grandfather."
- Claire:

19:10.828 --> 19:12.805
It's the mug I gave you
when Haley was born.

19:12.904 --> 19:14.082
You kept it all these years.

19:14.181 --> 19:16.405
Yeah. But, uh... it's yours now.

19:16.504 --> 19:18.597
I don't need it anymore.
I got a new title.

19:19.579 --> 19:21.051
"Great grandma"?

19:22.296 --> 19:23.375
Oh, hell. I grabbed the wrong one.

19:23.474 --> 19:24.257
Here.

19:24.848 --> 19:26.810
- I'm going to count to three.
- Yeah.

19:26.909 --> 19:28.545
Hey, how was your recital, Phil?

19:28.644 --> 19:30.181
Oh, I messed it all up for him.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.983
Sorry about that, Dad.

19:32.008 --> 19:34.362
I-I know that was your
big goal for the year.

19:34.461 --> 19:35.868
I have a better one now.

19:36.457 --> 19:38.453
<i>Mi ano fue hermoso.</i>

19:38.500 --> 19:40.612
- Mm.
- My year was beautiful.

19:40.711 --> 19:42.510
"Año" means "year."

19:42.609 --> 19:44.801
"Ano" means "anus."

19:45.816 --> 19:47.059
Still works.

19:47.703 --> 19:49.153
Hey, everybody.

19:49.252 --> 19:51.607
Ay, where are the babies?
I want to see them.

19:51.706 --> 19:53.800
Thers no easy way to say this.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.315
Mitch and Cam have a whole
thing they want to do.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.246
Oh, God. It's worse than I thought.

20:05.515 --> 20:08.296
Oh, my God! I love it so much!

20:16.806 --> 20:19.030
I can't believe they had
matching robes in their car.

20:20.405 --> 20:23.645
They're so beautiful!

20:26.591 --> 20:27.669
Good job.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.697
You're
both gonna get dog beds.

20:32.078 --> 20:33.952
- You're next, huh?
- Shh!

20:34.051 --> 20:35.228
Okay. Okay. I'm just saying.

20:39.483 --> 20:41.053
Good job, kid.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.621
Oh, is he still crying?

20:51.650 --> 20:52.723
Yeah, has been for hours.

20:52.824 --> 20:54.157
Wow.

20:54.259 --> 20:56.505
I thought he'd cry himself to sleep,
poor little guy.

20:56.540 --> 20:57.836
Well, has he eaten anything?

20:57.871 --> 20:59.488
Uh, I fed him an hour ago.

20:59.513 --> 21:01.280
It's amazing how one can be fine

21:01.381 --> 21:03.015
and the other one is so upset.

21:03.116 --> 21:04.817
You go up to bed.
I'll check on him one last time.

21:04.918 --> 21:06.385
Thanks, Mom.

21:06.486 --> 21:10.089
There's my big, brave boy.

21:10.190 --> 21:12.104
Sherry booked
a toothpaste commercial.

21:12.139 --> 21:12.858
Uh-huh.

21:12.959 --> 21:14.927
I'm going to have to
see that beautiful smile

21:15.028 --> 21:16.195
all the time!

21:16.296 --> 21:17.154
Mm.

21:17.597 --> 21:18.898
There, there. Let it out.
