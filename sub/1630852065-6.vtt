01:00.423 --> 01:02.423
It's difficult to translate,

01:02.506 --> 01:05.590
but your tragic story made me feel it.

01:07.298 --> 01:10.465
I believe that your planet
is worthy of saving.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.923
We shall give you a seed
that will restore your home

01:14.006 --> 01:16.756

01:33.340 --> 01:37.590
Well, this race of "Chelseas"
sound like they're incredible.

01:37.798 --> 01:41.715
Oh, it's not a race, but if it was,
Chelsea would definitely win.

01:41.798 --> 01:44.256
She's a human from planet Earth.

01:44.340 --> 01:48.965
Earth? I know Earth! I vacationed there
about 600 seasons ago.

01:49.048 --> 01:52.215
There was one creature I just adored.
What was it?

01:52.298 --> 01:55.965
Oh, the dodo! How is the dodo?

01:56.048 --> 01:59.173
-[gasps]
-Humans hunted to extinction,

01:59.256 --> 02:00.923
and other species too.

02:01.006 --> 02:04.048
[gasps] They did what?

02:04.131 --> 02:07.673
But in humans defense,
I heard they were delicious...

02:07.756 --> 02:12.465
Oh, what-- What he means is humans
look out for each other, right, guys?

02:12.548 --> 02:15.381
Exactly! They're, um... peaceful.

02:15.631 --> 02:17.506
Oh, yeah! Humans are obsessed with peace.

02:17.590 --> 02:20.090
You should see all the wars
they fight to preserve it!

[fake coughs] Not helping.

02:23.048 --> 02:24.131
[tutting]

02:24.215 --> 02:27.048
And now they send you
to save their planet for them.

02:27.131 --> 02:28.798
What happened to it?

02:28.881 --> 02:31.923
Meteor fallout? Extreme volcanic activity?

02:32.006 --> 02:34.298
Fungal infection?
[groans]

02:35.798 --> 02:37.215
Don't tell me.

02:37.298 --> 02:39.965
The humans destroyed their own planet?

02:40.048 --> 02:42.840
-No!
-Yes. Mostly by polluting the air

02:42.923 --> 02:45.173
and cutting down all the trees.

02:45.256 --> 02:48.590
Well, it's clear the Earth needs saving,

02:48.673 --> 02:50.798
from the human race!

02:50.881 --> 02:53.923
I think we can just tip the Earth
a little so all the humans fall off.

02:54.006 --> 02:55.256
We can do that, right?

02:56.256 --> 02:59.256
-[screams]
-Wait! You've got humans all wrong.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.631
Weeds must be pulled
or the garden is overrun.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.048
You seem honest.

03:04.131 --> 03:07.090
Would humans learn
from their mistakes, or repeat them?

03:07.173 --> 03:08.923
[whispers] Say yes.

03:09.006 --> 03:12.256
Wait, say no!
Wait, say yes to the first part,

03:12.340 --> 03:13.631
and no to the second part.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.673
You don't need to wipe humans out.

03:15.756 --> 03:17.673
-[sighs]
-They're wiping themselves out

03:17.756 --> 03:19.006
-all on their own.
-[gasps]

03:19.090 --> 03:23.756
As long as the Earth suffers
from the problem known as "humans,"

03:24.131 --> 03:25.215
no seed.

03:25.298 --> 03:27.215
[gavel bangs]

03:28.215 --> 03:29.506
I was just being honest!

03:29.590 --> 03:32.673
You're just mad because you're convinced
humans abandoned you,

03:32.756 --> 03:33.840
but Chelsea--

03:33.923 --> 03:35.465
Chelsea abandoned you too, you know?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.881
-Oh, snap!
-Nomi!

03:37.965 --> 03:39.465
One day, you'll realize that.

03:40.340 --> 03:44.548
[clears throat] Captain, I need your input
in the mission report on our failure.

03:44.631 --> 03:48.215
-Failure is not an option.
-But it is though, there's a tick box.

03:48.590 --> 03:51.423
Desperate times call for heroic measures.

03:52.506 --> 03:53.965
[gasps]

03:54.048 --> 03:55.756
If they won't give us a seed,

03:56.381 --> 03:58.048
we'll have to take one!

03:58.131 --> 04:00.256
Well, that doesn't sound very heroic.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.215
Well, does saving millions of lives
sound heroic?

04:03.298 --> 04:05.673
Very! But those Shrubdubs scare me.

04:05.756 --> 04:08.340
They can wipe out humanity
with the click of their...

04:08.423 --> 04:10.590
I wanna say, twigs? [munches]

04:10.673 --> 04:13.465
Well, to steal from them,
we'd need an airtight plan.

04:13.548 --> 04:14.923
-I mean, who's gonna have--
-[Ed coughs]

04:18.423 --> 04:19.881
Of course, he has blueprints.

04:19.965 --> 04:22.590
[scoffs] I plan a couple of heists
for every new place we visit.

04:22.673 --> 04:24.215
It's kind of my hobby.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.590
While you were distracted
with the mission, I was casing the joint,

04:27.673 --> 04:29.006
but for my plan to work,

04:29.090 --> 04:30.881
we need six dogs.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.381
[gasps]

04:43.256 --> 04:46.340
Mm! Got to admit,
having thumbs ain't so bad!

04:47.881 --> 04:51.798
Kira, we're planning a heist,
and Ed says we can't do it without you.

04:52.215 --> 04:55.881
Just think, you'd be helping
save an entire planet!

04:55.965 --> 04:58.798
An entire planet of furless,
tailless jerks.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.756
You shouldn't risk your lives for them.

05:01.506 --> 05:04.798
Okay, I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this, but...

05:05.298 --> 05:09.090
[whimpers]

05:09.465 --> 05:11.548
Puppy dog-eyes don't work on me.

05:11.631 --> 05:13.798
Okay, how about normal dog-eyes then?

05:15.256 --> 05:17.298
[sighs]

05:20.131 --> 05:22.256
It's okay, we try it with five dogs.

05:22.340 --> 05:26.131
Maybe four dogs by the end,
but hey, Chonies, you had a good run.

05:26.215 --> 05:28.798
-What?
-Nomi, heist music!

05:29.756 --> 05:32.590
Right, first up, the security.

05:32.673 --> 05:35.506
Proximity sensors will alert those eels
if we approach.

05:35.631 --> 05:37.756
That happens, and zap, we're hot dogs!

05:37.840 --> 05:40.173
There are also security drones.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.506
Yes! [chuckles]

05:41.590 --> 05:43.631
I love taking down drones!

05:43.715 --> 05:47.340
It's all the fun of blasting something
without the guilt of blasting something.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.631
[Ed] There are your cameras, your lasers,

05:49.715 --> 05:51.381
your trap doors to cosmic acid goo,

05:51.590 --> 05:52.881
all standard heist stuff.

05:52.965 --> 05:57.881
But the vault is guarded by a cog door
and she's a beaut!

05:57.965 --> 06:00.590
You gotta stop the cogs
on the right combination of symbols.

06:00.673 --> 06:04.756
Mess up, and it opens up portals
full of nasty creatures.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.631
It sounds unnecessarily convoluted.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.423
I know!

06:09.506 --> 06:13.215
The vault is a big fridge kept ice cold
so the seeds don't sprout.

06:13.298 --> 06:16.423
We'll need one of their vacuum sealed
boxes to loot that loot.

06:16.506 --> 06:19.048
Finally, guards everywhere,

06:19.131 --> 06:21.381
and these Shrubdubs
have thorns figuratively,

06:21.465 --> 06:22.506
also, literally.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.548
This seems really dangerous.

06:24.631 --> 06:26.590
What's everyone so worried about?

06:26.673 --> 06:30.506
It wouldn't be
heroes-overcoming-crazy-impossible-odds

06:30.590 --> 06:33.173
if there weren't crazy impossible odds!

06:33.256 --> 06:35.298
Why don't we split the difference?

06:35.381 --> 06:37.631
Stay here and watch a heist movie!

06:37.715 --> 06:40.506
You're right. This would be
foolhardy if not for...

06:40.590 --> 06:42.215
the nebula.

06:42.298 --> 06:44.048
[all] Ooh!

06:44.131 --> 06:47.173
[Ed] The station needs
to pass through it daily to draw power,

06:47.256 --> 06:49.965
but the nebula has one
very fun side effect.

06:50.048 --> 06:54.173
It renders all language
itself incomprehensible.

06:54.340 --> 06:57.590
Wait, so we won't be
able to talk! That's...

06:57.673 --> 06:58.923
Fine!

06:59.006 --> 07:01.131
And neither will the Shrubdub.

07:01.715 --> 07:05.631
They won't be able to speak to each other,
or raise the alarm for ten minutes.

07:06.006 --> 07:08.090
It's the only weakness they have.

07:08.173 --> 07:10.048
That, and presumably, fire.

07:10.131 --> 07:12.131
Captain, there's no way we can do this.

07:12.215 --> 07:14.256
There's no way we can't not do this!

07:14.340 --> 07:16.340
We are going to save the Earth!

07:16.423 --> 07:19.381
Garbage, you can't even save
your leftovers for tomorrow.

07:21.381 --> 07:24.423
[groans] You said the plan needs six dogs?

07:24.631 --> 07:27.965
-If Chonies is to survive, yes.
-Please?

07:28.256 --> 07:29.965
[sighs]

07:31.590 --> 07:32.673
Thank you.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.756
I'm not doing this for humans,

07:34.840 --> 07:36.840
I'm doing this so you don't die.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.298
[whimpers]

07:38.381 --> 07:40.506
Here's the plan. Like all of my best work,

07:40.590 --> 07:44.090
it starts with an impenetrable disguise.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.673
This feels weird.

07:50.590 --> 07:52.631
Oh, here comes the nebula!

07:57.798 --> 08:00.298
Then the clouds turned black,

08:00.381 --> 08:03.173
our crops died,
and the oceans dried up.

08:03.256 --> 08:05.423
Our planet is on the brink of extinction.

08:05.506 --> 08:07.506
One of my children turned to me,

08:07.590 --> 08:10.423
saying something that haunts me
to this day. She said...

We track that shield
and go help the other--

16:09.673 --> 16:11.340
[both] Wait, what are you talking about?

16:11.423 --> 16:13.006
-Congratulate me later.
-[gasps]

16:13.090 --> 16:14.631
We need to figure out
how to fly this home.

16:14.715 --> 16:17.673
-Are you crazy? We have to save the crew!
-They're fine!

16:17.756 --> 16:20.215
Don't let me distract you, Captain.

16:20.298 --> 16:22.340
Just a bit tricky to breathe,

16:22.423 --> 16:24.840
but carry on! I... I--

16:26.173 --> 16:28.215
What? You heard him! Totally fine!

16:28.423 --> 16:30.923
Garbage, you've put everyone
in danger today.

16:31.006 --> 16:34.131
This mission is over!
You need to drop the seed!

16:34.215 --> 16:37.090
No! I need to take the seed
home to Chelsea.

16:37.173 --> 16:38.548
This will fix everything!

16:38.631 --> 16:43.173
Is Chelsea more important
to you than your crew? Look at them!

17:15.923 --> 17:20.006
[sighs] My heist streak, broken!

17:20.090 --> 17:23.173
I gotta steal something.
Like-- like-- Like that wrench!

17:23.256 --> 17:26.631
No! Let me heist the wrench!

17:27.423 --> 17:28.423
[gasps]

17:33.423 --> 17:34.923
Kira, where are you going?

17:35.006 --> 17:37.006
-I'm leaving.
-What?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.923
Leaving? Why?

17:39.006 --> 17:41.381
You said all dogs look out for each other,

17:41.465 --> 17:44.048
and I was gullible enough
to think you meant it.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.298
I know today didn't go as planned.

17:46.381 --> 17:48.465
You're risking your fur for humans,

17:48.548 --> 17:51.465
while they sit back at home
and wait for you to be a good dog

17:51.548 --> 17:52.965
and obey their commands!

17:53.048 --> 17:55.631
They don't deserve your loyalty.

17:55.715 --> 17:57.340
I can't speak for all humans,

17:57.423 --> 17:59.673
but Chelsea is worth saving.

17:59.756 --> 18:01.590
If you had an owner like her,
you'd under--

18:01.673 --> 18:04.173
I did have an owner like her, Garbage!

18:04.256 --> 18:06.965
A P.R.A.T.S. scientist,
just like your Chelsea!

18:07.048 --> 18:09.340
I sent out distress signals every day,

18:09.423 --> 18:11.506
and she never came looking!

18:11.590 --> 18:14.006
She never even told
the M-Bark I was lost!

18:14.923 --> 18:17.673
My owner forgot about me!

18:18.381 --> 18:20.965
-Well, that doesn't mean--
-Chelsea's forgotten about you?

18:21.048 --> 18:23.673
You've sent her messages every day, and?

18:23.756 --> 18:25.090
Maybe she's just not getting--

18:25.173 --> 18:28.090
Maybe she doesn't care, Garbage.

18:29.090 --> 18:31.590
Your loyalty is in the wrong place.

18:31.673 --> 18:35.006
If it came to a choice between saving
the dogs and saving humans,

18:35.090 --> 18:37.090
you'd make the wrong call.

18:37.173 --> 18:39.215
That's why I'm leaving.

18:41.006 --> 18:43.090
Wait, I wouldn't.

18:43.173 --> 18:45.256
I won't sacrifice my crew

18:45.340 --> 18:47.673
or any dog on this ship for anything.

18:48.131 --> 18:50.881
I made the wrong call today,
but I won't again.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.631
Dogs over humans, you mean it?

18:55.923 --> 18:57.298
I mean it.

18:57.381 --> 18:59.048
Okay.

18:59.131 --> 19:02.673
[gasps] You'd betray our mission,
would you, Garbage?

19:02.756 --> 19:04.506
We'll see about that.

19:13.298 --> 19:15.215
Earth...
