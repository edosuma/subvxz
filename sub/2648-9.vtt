WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:06.520
So, the rate of diffusion
equals something...

00:06.615 --> 00:10.317
times the square root of something...

00:10.411 --> 00:11.786
I give up.

00:11.871 --> 00:14.362
Aw, so close!

00:14.456 --> 00:16.497
- Shut up!
- Don't worry. You'll get it.

00:16.585 --> 00:18.245
You know, a lot of famous scientists
are women.

00:18.337 --> 00:20.128
They're fat though, right?

00:20.213 --> 00:23.132
Come on, Alex.
It's time for your cello lesson.

00:23.217 --> 00:24.629
How's the tutoring going?

00:24.719 --> 00:27.424
Are you familiar with the term
"throwing good money after bad"?

00:27.514 --> 00:30.883
Are you familiar with the term "Dunphy,
party of one"? Because you will be.

00:30.976 --> 00:33.550
- Girls.
- Haley's coming along really well, Ms. Dunphy.

00:33.647 --> 00:35.806
Good! The key is to take a lot
of little breaks...

00:35.898 --> 00:37.809
so you don't get frustrated
and want to quit.

00:37.901 --> 00:39.230
Got it.

00:39.319 --> 00:40.695
I was talking to David.

00:40.780 --> 00:41.811
Come on, sweetie.

00:43.575 --> 00:45.733
I'm just saying,
she's never gonna get a job.

00:45.827 --> 00:48.318
And how do we know the right
Middle Eastern businessman...

00:48.414 --> 00:49.908
wouldn't treat her great?

00:49.998 --> 00:51.540
I left my shopping list inside.

00:51.626 --> 00:53.370
For the record, we thought
she could live with you.

00:53.462 --> 00:56.083
Like I'm gonna tell any of you
where I live.

00:56.172 --> 00:57.965
Oh.

00:58.051 --> 00:59.164
Haley!

01:01.511 --> 01:04.182
What? We only do this
when I get one right.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.137
Mama should be here by now.
I wonder what's keeping her?

01:07.227 --> 01:08.602
Cam, that depends.

01:08.686 --> 01:11.725
Did she take her jalopy
or one of them new fancy flyin' machines?

01:11.815 --> 01:14.603
Missouri's more cosmopolitan
than you give it credit for.

01:14.693 --> 01:16.854
It's got a very vibrant
cowboy poetry scene.

01:16.947 --> 01:19.069
Not sure you're making
the point that you think.

01:19.158 --> 01:21.032
- That's her. Come on.

01:21.118 --> 01:23.111
Look alive. Look alive.

01:24.122 --> 01:25.948
- Mama!
- My baby!

01:26.040 --> 01:28.498
Oh, little boomer!
Oh, puppy kiss!

01:30.380 --> 01:31.922
- Mitchell, get over here!
- Oh! Hey, Barb!

01:32.005 --> 01:33.584
My baby's baby!

01:33.674 --> 01:35.715
- Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!
- Oh, yeah!

01:35.803 --> 01:37.297
Well, I don't wanna overstate this...

01:37.387 --> 01:39.794
but my mom is the greatest woman
that ever lived.

01:39.889 --> 01:41.384
Cam loves his mom.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.144
She raised four kids,
two barns and a whole lotta hell.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.640
That sounds like a country song.

01:45.729 --> 01:48.815
And that song would be called
"The Greatest Woman That Ever Lived."

01:49.735 --> 01:51.230
Cam loves his mom.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.148
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:54.241 --> 01:56.149
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:56.243 --> 01:58.320
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:58.412 --> 02:00.120
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

02:00.206 --> 02:01.486
<i># Hey ##.</i>

02:04.001 --> 02:07.168
From the minute I met Barb
she has been open...

02:07.255 --> 02:09.627
and loving and caring.

02:09.716 --> 02:13.002
Oh, I have missed these shoulders.

02:13.096 --> 02:15.172
Ohh... Aaah!

02:15.264 --> 02:18.266
<i>If</i> I had one complaint...

02:19.270 --> 02:20.894
and I do...

02:20.979 --> 02:23.519
it's the...

02:23.609 --> 02:26.693
inappropriate putting of her hands
on my body.

02:26.777 --> 02:30.230
Hey, Barb. Got you the cranberries
you wanted for the stuffing.

02:30.325 --> 02:32.696
Oh, bless your heart.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.243
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

02:34.328 --> 02:35.953
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

02:36.040 --> 02:37.948
Let me get in there and help ya.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.912
Ohh. Ohh! Ohh!

02:41.004 --> 02:42.711
- And a horsie bite!
- Ohh!

02:42.797 --> 02:45.715
- <i> </i>
- This is how I like to cuddle.

02:48.930 --> 02:51.255
It's-it's been going on a long time.

02:52.976 --> 02:55.051
Jay, you wanna go to the mall with me?

02:55.145 --> 02:57.138
No, actually, my stomach's
a little funny today.

02:57.229 --> 02:58.807
Oh, I am so sorry, <i>papi.</i>

02:58.900 --> 03:01.105
Maybe we'd stop first at the crib store...

03:01.194 --> 03:04.194
and you lay down and I buy you
a little dress, hmm?

03:04.279 --> 03:06.736
Gloria thinks Americans are babies.

03:06.825 --> 03:10.574
Well, in Colombia we couldn't go run
to the hospital for every little sniffle...

03:10.663 --> 03:12.406
or dislocated shoulder.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.205
Okay, good.

03:20.132 --> 03:22.172
5-6. I serve, huh?

03:25.263 --> 03:27.589
Jay, what are your symptoms?

03:27.682 --> 03:29.675
Nausea? Bloating?

03:29.769 --> 03:33.138
What did I say about getting off
that crazy doctor Web site?

03:33.230 --> 03:34.724
I'm just worried about Jay.

03:34.816 --> 03:38.267
Stomach pains can mean a lot of things:
Intestinal blockage...

03:38.361 --> 03:41.814
- Do you have a fever?
- Stop it! Manny, he's fine.

03:41.908 --> 03:43.237
- Tell him you're fine.
- I'm fine.

03:43.326 --> 03:46.742
- Okay, good. Get in the car.
- Uh, home fine, not mall fine.

03:46.830 --> 03:49.618
Jay, you know what happens
when I shop angry.

03:49.708 --> 03:51.202
- I'll clear a space.
- Mmm.

03:55.549 --> 03:58.040
- I'm not loving your color.
- Go play.

03:59.261 --> 04:01.218
Don't be a hero.

04:01.305 --> 04:03.132
So, dumb guys go for dumb girls...

04:03.223 --> 04:05.633
<i>and</i> smart guys go for dumb girls?

04:05.728 --> 04:08.099
- What do the smart girls get?
- Cats, mostly.

04:08.187 --> 04:11.141
So, Haley, how long have I been paying
this guy to make out with you?

04:11.233 --> 04:12.942
Uh, about a week.

04:13.027 --> 04:15.565
First it was just to shut him up,
but now I'm starting to like him.

04:15.654 --> 04:18.147
If you really like him though,
you have to break up with Dylan.

04:18.241 --> 04:20.317
What? No!

04:20.411 --> 04:23.162
Believe me. And it's best for everybody
if you just do it quickly.

04:23.246 --> 04:27.412
I can't believe we're having this conversation.
He's like part of the family.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.421
Trust me. It's the right thing to do.

04:30.505 --> 04:32.084
Just end it.

04:32.175 --> 04:34.500
Okay, but be gentle.

04:34.594 --> 04:37.001
Boys are surprisingly sensitive
at that age.

04:37.097 --> 04:39.801
- Water polo girl story.
- Yes, I'm gonna tell the water polo girl story!

04:39.891 --> 04:41.303
- 'Cause it hurt!
- Mmm.

04:41.393 --> 04:44.430
Okay, so I'm working
in the principal's office.

04:44.521 --> 04:47.192
She walks in, hair all silver
from the chlorine...

04:47.274 --> 04:50.609
tells me she wants
her varsity jacket back.

04:50.695 --> 04:54.112
I tear up a little. Then I tear up a lot.

04:54.201 --> 04:55.944
I'm begging, I'm begging.

04:56.035 --> 04:59.535
At some point I realize I'm sitting on the
button to the high school intercom system.

04:59.622 --> 05:01.532
Yuk it up, ladies.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.914
Wasn't funny then. Is not funny now.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.544
It was traumatic, Haley.

05:07.256 --> 05:09.749
Don't do Dylan like
Linda "The Cannon" Concannon did me.

05:10.677 --> 05:11.958
Honey...

05:12.054 --> 05:14.889
that was a long time ago.

05:14.974 --> 05:17.050
- I loved her.
- Okay.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.722
I know.

05:18.813 --> 05:21.849
You know what? Maybe I'll call Dylan
after he talks to Haley.

05:21.941 --> 05:23.434
He's gonna need someone to lean on.

05:23.525 --> 05:26.444
That someone should not be
his ex-girlfriend's father.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.780
Honey, when Dylan is out of her life,
he should be out of ours.

05:29.865 --> 05:31.243
You've always hated Dylan.

05:31.327 --> 05:32.904
I have <i>not</i> always hated Dylan.

05:32.996 --> 05:35.236
I have always thought
that Haley could do better.

05:35.330 --> 05:37.289
Plus, the new boyfriend is <i>so</i> smart.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.499
It's done. We broke up.

05:40.587 --> 05:42.913
- What?
- I texted Dylan. It's over.

05:43.007 --> 05:45.415
- Bet that's him.

05:45.510 --> 05:46.921
Yep.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.970
Sad face emoticon!

05:49.056 --> 05:51.345
You can feel the hurt through the phone.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.269
Cam's mom spent half of dinner
with her hands all over me.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.729
It was like she was blind and wanted
to know what my thighs looked like.

06:03.698 --> 06:04.861
Are you sure?

06:04.948 --> 06:07.903
Are you really the best judge
of this kind of thing?

06:07.994 --> 06:10.864
- You've had boundary issues since you were a kid.
- I have not!

06:10.956 --> 06:12.950
Okay. Sorry. My mistake.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.450
Must be Cam's mom.

06:15.544 --> 06:17.039
Her issues.

06:17.130 --> 06:18.921
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just getting a spoon.

06:19.008 --> 06:20.086
- Stop it.
- Is it bothering you?

06:20.176 --> 06:21.206
- Yes, it is.
- Hey, Mitchell.

06:21.302 --> 06:22.463
- Claire, stop it!
- Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell.

06:22.552 --> 06:24.509
- Force field!

06:24.597 --> 06:26.637
That never stops being fun.

06:26.725 --> 06:29.642
Good. Listen, this is...
this is not in my head, Claire.

06:29.728 --> 06:31.436
And it's actually getting worse.

06:31.522 --> 06:34.143
- What does Cam say?
- Well, he never seems to notice.

06:34.232 --> 06:36.143
And I certainly can't
talk to him about it...

06:36.234 --> 06:39.153
because God forbid
I say anything negative about his mom.

06:39.238 --> 06:41.990
One time I added salt
to her casserole...

06:42.076 --> 06:44.034
and he went into the garage
and punched the car.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.157
Okay, Mitchell, if this is happening,
and I'm pretty sure it isn't...

06:47.248 --> 06:48.363
Thank you. Supportive.

06:48.457 --> 06:50.831
Then you need Cam to see
his mom feeling you up...

06:50.920 --> 06:52.958
- and then make Cam deal with it.
- Eeeww.

06:53.047 --> 06:55.620
- Think about it.

06:57.427 --> 06:58.541
Hi, Dylan.

06:58.637 --> 07:00.178
- Hi, Mrs. Dunphy.
- Mmm.

07:00.262 --> 07:03.015
Or I guess now that Haley and I broke up,
I should call you Claire.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.683
I actually think we're gonna stick with Mrs.
Dunphy. Come on in. How you doing?

07:06.770 --> 07:08.146
- Not so good.
- Hmm.

07:08.232 --> 07:11.233
I mean, everywhere I look
I see her face.

07:11.317 --> 07:13.358
- Hmm.

07:13.444 --> 07:15.818
To be fair, Dylan,
that is a family portrait.

07:15.907 --> 07:19.489
- I gotta go get some of my stuff. Is that cool?
- Oh, sure. Yeah.

07:22.747 --> 07:24.290
There she is again.

07:27.503 --> 07:29.413
Don't look on the bookshelf.
You're just gonna...

07:31.926 --> 07:35.710
Hey, kid, you got a minute?
I need the name of that medical Web site.

07:35.804 --> 07:38.925
Can this wait until I'm home?
I'm having the round of my life.

07:39.017 --> 07:43.346
I've been thinking I might have a couple of those...
those symptoms you were talking about.

07:43.439 --> 07:44.933
Oh. I see.

07:45.025 --> 07:47.775
You might as well play through.
It's gonna be a while.

07:47.861 --> 07:51.278
I'm probably wrong,
but I just wanna make sure.

07:51.365 --> 07:52.942
- Is that Manny?
- Work.

07:53.033 --> 07:57.163
- Hmm.
- So tell 'em I'll get that order out this afternoon, huh?

07:57.246 --> 07:59.738
Did she buy that?
Because it sounded fake on this end.

07:59.832 --> 08:02.242
- I'll talk to you later, Tom.

08:02.336 --> 08:03.996
- Tom.
- Mmm.

08:04.838 --> 08:06.249
Dylan!

08:06.340 --> 08:08.915
Aw, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.505
Hey, Mr. Dunphy.

08:10.596 --> 08:13.596
Hey, now that you guys are broken up,
you can call me whatever you want.

08:13.682 --> 08:16.220
Phil, Vitamin P, P-Daddy.

08:16.311 --> 08:18.683
- Okay, Phil.
- Okay.

08:20.023 --> 08:23.108
I'm gonna miss that bad boy.
Might have to get my own ax.

08:23.194 --> 08:25.519
Sometimes I come in here
and noodle on it.

08:25.612 --> 08:27.736
Actually, I've been writing
a little song of my own.

08:27.823 --> 08:30.611
Might be able to pluck out a few...

08:30.702 --> 08:33.159
You know, I keep on hoping
that this is just a dream...

08:33.246 --> 08:35.323
that Haley and I didn't really break up.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.123
But it's not a dream.

08:37.208 --> 08:40.544
Unless the whole thing was a dream and
we never even dated in the first place.

08:40.631 --> 08:43.631
- Weird. This is kinda what my song's about.
- Yeah, weird.

08:47.096 --> 08:51.178
Hey. I know this is tough,
but you're gonna be fine.

08:51.268 --> 08:54.221
You know,
I was a lot like you in high school.

08:54.312 --> 08:57.351
Except my hair was shorter
and my guitar was a flute.

08:59.568 --> 09:03.520
Well, if you want your own guitar,
I mean, we could go out and pick you one.

09:03.616 --> 09:05.905
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

09:05.993 --> 09:08.116
- Yeah. Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

09:08.204 --> 09:11.240
Well, I guess I'll get going...

09:11.333 --> 09:14.334
so... I can...

09:14.420 --> 09:16.543
well, be alone forever.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.004
Uh, what... what the hell.

09:21.095 --> 09:22.636
Yeah!

09:22.721 --> 09:24.179
Let's go guitar shopping.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.639
Awesome!

09:25.725 --> 09:28.512
Uh, do me a favor.
Don't tell Mrs. Dunphy.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.891
Yeah. Definitely. You got it.

09:30.981 --> 09:33.388
- All right.
- Well, I guess I'll see ya.

09:33.483 --> 09:34.516
Okay.

09:34.609 --> 09:36.852
- Y... You, uh...

09:36.945 --> 09:39.699
You can go ahead and exit
through the front door.

09:39.782 --> 09:41.776
Oh, right. Habit.

09:44.705 --> 09:47.623
- My old yearbooks!
- I saved 'em all.

09:47.709 --> 09:49.369
Ohh!

09:49.461 --> 09:51.003
- Oh, look.
- What?

09:51.086 --> 09:54.125
"You're the cutest boy in school.
We're gonna have an awesome summer.

09:54.216 --> 09:55.960
Smooches, Brenda."

09:57.679 --> 10:01.012
Oh, Brenda, you're about to have
the most confusing summer of your life.

10:01.098 --> 10:03.507
- Hey, guys!

10:03.603 --> 10:05.180
- Hi!
- Oh, there's Mitchell.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.896
My little corn silk!

10:06.981 --> 10:08.973
Ahh... Ohh!

10:09.066 --> 10:13.065
- Oh, Barb, oh, you are such a good hugger.
- Well, gosh.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.982
Isn't she the best hugger?

10:15.074 --> 10:16.984
Oh, thank you.

10:17.076 --> 10:20.113
- Oh, and look what I got you, Barb.
- What's tha... Oh!

10:20.205 --> 10:21.783
Scratchers!

10:21.874 --> 10:23.415
- Thank you.
- Mmm!

10:23.500 --> 10:25.409
- Nice! A lot of 'em.

10:25.502 --> 10:28.420
- Oh, that's your tea. I'm gonna get your tea.
- Thanks, honey.

10:28.506 --> 10:30.250
- Well, I need a quarter.
- Oh.

10:30.342 --> 10:31.919
- Let me have that quarter.
- Oh. Wow, yeah.

10:32.010 --> 10:33.468
Feel free to fish around in there.

10:33.553 --> 10:36.223
Cam? Cam!
I'd like a cup too, please.

10:36.306 --> 10:37.588
Just a second.

10:37.684 --> 10:41.848
Oh, Barb, you know what?
I strained myself so bad today.

10:41.939 --> 10:43.931
- Oh.
- Well, what's hurtin' on you?

10:44.023 --> 10:47.607
It's this area between my lower back
and upper thigh.

10:47.696 --> 10:49.854
- Sounds like your fanny.
- It's my fanny.

10:49.947 --> 10:51.524
It's really knotted up.

10:51.615 --> 10:53.525
Well, you need someone
to work on that.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.327
Oh, I would love that.

10:55.413 --> 10:59.113
It's really seized up. Just put
your fingers all over my... my fanny.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.952
Your magic fingers.

11:01.044 --> 11:03.748
- Barb.
- Mama, your tea.

11:03.838 --> 11:05.464
- Mitchell.
- Thanks, sweetie.

11:05.550 --> 11:07.874
See you in the room for a minute?
Thank you.

11:07.969 --> 11:10.377
- It's very hot. Don't burn your tongue.
- All right, honey.

11:14.685 --> 11:17.602
Okay, I am not gonna cry,
but I wanna know why, Mitchell...

11:17.688 --> 11:20.226
why you are presenting to my mother
like a baboon.

11:20.316 --> 11:22.394
I wanted you to see her fondling me.

11:22.486 --> 11:24.977
- So you <i>do</i> want me to cry.
- No, no, Cam.

11:25.072 --> 11:28.987
She's always touching me inappropriately,
and you never seem to notice.

11:29.077 --> 11:30.357
Show me, Mitchell.

11:30.454 --> 11:33.324
Show me on Lily's doll
where my mother is touching you.

11:33.415 --> 11:38.124
Look, I know you don't want to hear this, but
she's handsy and it makes me uncomfortable.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.288
Oh, my God. I know what this is.

11:41.383 --> 11:43.459
You're just not used to
having a mother that shows affection.

11:43.552 --> 11:45.840
- Do not make this about my mother.
- I didn't.

11:45.928 --> 11:48.421
But it is normal for a mother
to be physical...

11:48.515 --> 11:50.841
and it is not strange...

11:50.934 --> 11:53.771
for an occasional hug
or a little pat on the fanny.

11:53.856 --> 11:56.347
Okay, these aren't pats, Cam. No.

11:56.442 --> 11:58.184
She squeezes and lingers!

11:58.276 --> 12:00.318
Show me where she squeezes
and lingers.

12:00.405 --> 12:02.444
Cam, put the doll down.

12:03.699 --> 12:07.450
I don't know if this
is just sexual or Crazytown...

12:07.537 --> 12:11.667
but your mother cannot keep her hands
off of me and it's creeping me out.

12:12.794 --> 12:14.537
No. Oh...

12:14.629 --> 12:17.299
- B-Barb.   I'm sorry.

12:17.384 --> 12:21.001
Let me show you
where you stabbed my mama.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.009
Thanks for helping me pick out my ax.

12:26.102 --> 12:28.427
You were so right. The one
with two necks would have been overkill.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.391
- If you want, you can have some of that.
- Diet starts tomorrow!

12:31.483 --> 12:33.391
Don't tell Mrs. Dunphy about this either.

12:33.484 --> 12:37.566
I, uh... I... I always wanted to go to this place
with Haley, but she said it looked stupid.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.064
She's a girl with strong opinions,
like her mother.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.235
Claire hates
this new sweatshirt I bought.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.653
She says it looks like something
a girl would wear to the beach.

12:44.748 --> 12:47.999
- Yeah, it does.
- But I wear it anyway.

12:48.086 --> 12:52.462
See? I figure, why be alive if you can't
do the things you're passionate about?

12:53.509 --> 12:55.299
What are you passionate about, Dylan?

12:55.386 --> 12:58.091
Uh, I always wanted
to drive to Graceland.

12:58.179 --> 12:59.344
Fun!

12:59.433 --> 13:02.137
- What else?
- I know a guy who can get me a pet bobcat.

13:02.227 --> 13:04.765
Yeah... No, you don't really
know what they're gonna do.

13:04.854 --> 13:08.272
The point is, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

13:08.359 --> 13:09.901
Enjoy being single.

13:09.985 --> 13:12.903
I really oughta play that song for you.
This is all in there.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.614
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

13:14.700 --> 13:16.193
Be right back.

13:16.197 --> 13:22.271
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

13:24.878 --> 13:27.203
Hey, hey, come here.

13:27.298 --> 13:30.003
- Is that guy over there with someone?
- Uh-huh.

13:30.093 --> 13:33.296
- Could you tell if there was anything going on between them?
- I don't know.

13:33.387 --> 13:36.508
They <i>were</i> talking about
taking a trip to Graceland together.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.885
He just wants to go 'cause
he thinks it's an amusement park!

13:45.068 --> 13:48.688
I gotta tell you, this is looking
more and more like diverticulitis.

13:48.781 --> 13:52.481
Do they say how to treat it, like a heating pad or...
There it is again!

13:52.577 --> 13:55.780
- Describe the pain.
- It's like I'm being stabbed.

13:55.872 --> 13:57.996
But also like I ate a bad scallop...

13:58.083 --> 13:59.993
that's stabbing me from the inside.

14:00.086 --> 14:02.162
That's colorful,
but there's no box for that.

14:02.254 --> 14:03.749
What are you guys looking at?

14:03.839 --> 14:05.632
- Girls!
- <i>Huffington Post!</i> Uh, girls.

14:05.716 --> 14:08.007
Manny, let me see that screen.

14:08.095 --> 14:09.672
What did I tell you?

14:09.763 --> 14:12.337
It's not his fault. I asked him to look.

14:12.433 --> 14:15.768
- I'm starting to think I have a serious problem here.
- Yes, you do! That computer!

14:15.854 --> 14:18.477
You read it there,
you think it here, you feel it here.

14:18.565 --> 14:20.773
You wanna feel better?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.149
There. You're cured!

14:25.281 --> 14:29.031
Give me 15 minutes, then tell Florence
Nightingale I went to the hospital.

14:33.249 --> 14:36.500
- ##
- ##

14:37.672 --> 14:39.830
- ##

14:39.923 --> 14:42.213
I'm gonna kill <i>her!
</i> I'm gonna kill <i>him!</i>

14:42.302 --> 14:44.591
- I'm gonna kill <i>both</i> of them!
- What happened?

14:44.679 --> 14:46.506
Dylan has a new girlfriend!

14:46.597 --> 14:49.351
- When did that happen?
- Who cares?

14:49.435 --> 14:53.054
I'm just surprised
he didn't say anything... to you.

14:53.147 --> 14:55.686
He's not answering my texts.
How could he do this to me?

14:55.776 --> 14:57.852
Uh, honey, you <i>were</i>
the one who broke up with him.

14:57.944 --> 15:01.195
I didn't think he was gonna
find someone so fast.

15:01.282 --> 15:03.903
- Maybe he's better than I thought.
- No, he's not.

15:03.993 --> 15:06.032
What? No, he's not better.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.158
No. You know who's better?
David. David the tutor.

15:09.249 --> 15:10.744
Smart-smart David?

15:10.835 --> 15:12.745
- Maybe that's him right now.

15:12.837 --> 15:16.124
Do you want the house to yourself?
For just a little while?

15:20.972 --> 15:23.806
- I got your texts. You swore a lot.

15:23.891 --> 15:25.719
- Who is she?
- Who is who?

15:25.810 --> 15:28.646
Your new girlfriend. I need her name
and address so I can mess her up.

15:28.730 --> 15:30.439
I don't have a new girlfriend.

15:30.523 --> 15:32.435
- Don't play dumb, Dylan.
- I'm not.

15:32.527 --> 15:34.152
I'm never playing dumb.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.444
I saw you at that stupid restaurant...

15:36.531 --> 15:39.283
sharing a sundae,
with her ugly sweatshirt on the chair.

15:40.995 --> 15:44.412
- Oh, is that the skank?
- No. No, there's... there's no skank.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.457
- Well, then why aren't you answering it?

15:46.543 --> 15:49.628
- Because I wanna talk to you.
- Well, I wanna talk to her.

15:49.713 --> 15:53.048
I'm gonna call her back and tell her to
keep her hands off of what belongs to me.

15:53.134 --> 15:54.962
Haley...

15:55.054 --> 15:58.220
- Hello?
- Dad?

15:58.306 --> 15:59.800
Haley?

16:01.644 --> 16:04.100
Oh, my God.
The sweatshirt.

16:04.189 --> 16:05.931
That was <i>you</i> with Dylan?

16:06.023 --> 16:07.933
Wait, <i>you're</i> the other girl?

16:08.027 --> 16:09.190
No! We're just friends.

16:09.278 --> 16:10.736
- Phil...
- Shh!

16:10.822 --> 16:13.491
Okay, put the phone down.
What is going on?

16:13.574 --> 16:15.318
He needed someone to talk to.

16:15.410 --> 16:17.403
He took the breakup pretty hard.

16:17.496 --> 16:18.954
- But...
- You did?

16:19.039 --> 16:22.989
- Yeah. I kept on hoping we'd get back together.

16:23.085 --> 16:26.003
Thinking of you with someone else
just... just drove me crazy.

16:26.089 --> 16:27.749
Oh, me too, baby.

16:27.842 --> 16:31.590
But then your dad helped me figure out
maybe it's best if we're apart.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.507
Nice.
- I mean...

16:33.598 --> 16:37.514
- I think I just need a little time to date Dylan.
- Mm-hmm.

16:37.602 --> 16:40.604
And I mean me,
not another guy named Dylan.

16:40.690 --> 16:43.360
So, we're still broken up?

16:43.443 --> 16:45.270
Yeah, I think so.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.654
Well, okay.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.699
Um...

16:50.785 --> 16:52.529
I don't... I'll see you.

16:52.619 --> 16:53.818
Yeah.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.951
- Um...
- Bye!

16:58.627 --> 17:01.546
Are you okay, baby?
Do you need another pillow?

17:01.630 --> 17:04.502
I know you think this is nothing,
but he did say it could be an ulcer.

17:04.592 --> 17:06.252
He also said it could be gas.

17:06.343 --> 17:08.717
Do you want me to burp you?
Come here. Come here.

17:08.805 --> 17:11.723
Dollars to doughnuts it's diverticulitis.

17:11.809 --> 17:13.006
Actually, it's not.

17:13.101 --> 17:14.596
Aha!

17:14.688 --> 17:17.060
You have acute appendicitis. We need
to get you into surgery right away.

17:17.148 --> 17:19.640
Emergency surgery.
I told you it was something.

17:19.736 --> 17:22.404
- Aha!
- That can't be right. You have to check again.

17:22.488 --> 17:26.154
The tests are conclusive. Everything
will be all right, Mr. Pritchett. Let's go.

17:26.242 --> 17:29.694
No, Jay! If that's true, then I'm the
worst wife in the whole wide world!

17:29.788 --> 17:31.698
I made you suffer for two whole days!

17:31.790 --> 17:34.079
- Honey, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

17:34.169 --> 17:36.576
Why? Why do I always
almost kill my husbands?

17:36.671 --> 17:40.539
And I wanna hear this story sometime, but
I'm sorta counting down to a rupture here!

17:40.635 --> 17:43.173
No! You can't go without forgiving me!

17:43.261 --> 17:46.181
- What if you die in there? What do I do without you?
- I forgive you!

17:46.265 --> 17:48.839
- But nobody dies of an appendectomy.
- True.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.222
It's usually the anesthesia that gets you.
You're over 60, right?

17:52.315 --> 17:54.771
I will never forget you, Jay!

17:54.858 --> 17:58.395
Could you go back to not caring, please?

17:58.488 --> 17:59.817
Mitchell, it's Barb.

17:59.907 --> 18:02.280
Oh. Barb, I'm so sorry.

18:02.369 --> 18:05.488
Well, no, h-honey, you hush. Look, I...

18:05.580 --> 18:07.620
I've been thinking about what I heard...

18:07.706 --> 18:11.955
and... maybe I do touch you too much.

18:12.045 --> 18:15.083
And I could say
it's 'cause we're family...

18:15.175 --> 18:17.583
but, you know, I don't know.

18:17.678 --> 18:21.011
I guess I have been
having some fun with you, and I...

18:21.099 --> 18:23.221
I-I-I thought that it was harmless...

18:23.308 --> 18:26.809
but I would never want
to make you uncomfortable.

18:26.896 --> 18:28.972
Barb, it's my fault too.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.853
- So we're okay?
- Yes! Yes, of course.

18:31.943 --> 18:34.151
Thank God.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.564
Because I couldn't live with myself...

18:36.657 --> 18:40.028
if things stayed weird between us.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.445
- Uh, Cam! Cam!
- What is it?

18:42.539 --> 18:45.162
- Well, we got it all worked out, sweetie!
- Oh, great!

18:45.252 --> 18:48.336
- Let me get my camera.
- Okay, that's not necessary, h... No!

18:48.422 --> 18:50.579
From now on, if I go too far...

18:50.675 --> 18:53.676
- please, you just tell me about it.
- Okay.

18:53.762 --> 18:55.339
What is th... Oh!

18:55.429 --> 18:57.174
Almost lost my bracelet.

18:57.265 --> 18:58.974
- Oh, wait a minute!
- And there it is. Okay.

18:59.059 --> 19:01.976
Oh, dang it!
- I'll get it.

19:02.061 --> 19:03.723
Oh, no. I saw where it fell, honey.

19:03.814 --> 19:06.187
- Force field! Force field!

19:06.275 --> 19:07.770
- What's going on?

19:07.860 --> 19:09.854
- I lost my bracelet in here.
- Mama!

19:09.947 --> 19:13.197
Listen, I think this might be
one of those situations...

19:13.284 --> 19:16.784
where Mitchell feels like
you're crossing a boundary.

19:16.872 --> 19:18.532
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.699
- This too?
- Yeah.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.289
Well.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.373
L...

19:24.463 --> 19:28.297
I've gotta have a good, long think
about how I conduct myself.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.880
I'm truly sorry, Mitchell.

19:29.970 --> 19:32.259
It's okay. It's okay.

19:32.347 --> 19:34.222
- Well, let's take one quick picture...
Yeah.

19:34.308 --> 19:35.886
- And we'll get out of his way.
- Absolutely.

19:35.977 --> 19:37.721
- Scooch together there.
It's all right.

19:37.812 --> 19:38.892
Okay.

19:45.070 --> 19:46.732
Hey.

19:46.823 --> 19:48.733
I miss him.

19:48.826 --> 19:50.283
Yeah.

19:50.368 --> 19:52.611
He was your first real boyfriend.

19:52.705 --> 19:55.742
I keep expecting him to show up.

19:55.833 --> 19:59.084
He used to come by at night
and I'd sneak out to see him.

19:59.170 --> 20:01.876
- Yeah, I know.
- You knew?

20:01.965 --> 20:05.584
His car's 30 years old
and doesn't have a muffler.

20:05.678 --> 20:07.172
And he honked.

20:08.849 --> 20:10.225
I loved that car.

20:11.561 --> 20:14.644
I rode in it to the guitar store.

20:14.729 --> 20:16.890
I felt like I was flying.

20:19.987 --> 20:22.857
I know it hurts now, sweetheart, but...

20:22.949 --> 20:25.950
that's how you know
it was a relationship worth having.

20:31.624 --> 20:33.120
Oh.

20:38.048 --> 20:39.841
Thanks, Dad.

20:57.237 --> 20:57.280
So, Dylan, are you lovin' Graceland?

20:57.280 --> 20:59.688
So, Dylan, are you lovin' Graceland?

21:00.909 --> 21:02.700
Yeah, that's true.

21:02.786 --> 21:05.742
Probably would be cooler
if they had roller coasters.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.749
Still, it's fun to see
where the King lived, huh?

21:08.834 --> 21:10.829
No. No, no, no. That's just an expression.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.416
America doesn't have a king.

21:13.632 --> 21:15.256
Yeah.

21:15.343 --> 21:18.260
Oh, sure. Uh-huh.

21:19.847 --> 21:21.258
When?

21:22.227 --> 21:24.266
Well, that's not always the case.

21:24.354 --> 21:25.765
Huh?

21:25.854 --> 21:28.773
So, did you get a chance to
listen to that song I sent you?

21:28.858 --> 21:31.777
No? You got seven minutes?

21:36.576 --> 21:37.607
English - US - SDH
