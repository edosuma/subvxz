10:10.360 --> 10:12.275

their reservation log.

10:12.318 --> 10:13.885
Couple hundred names to sort through.

10:14.930 --> 10:16.496
You know, a...

10:16.540 --> 10:18.063
a woman

10:18.107 --> 10:20.500
opened that safety deposit
box three years ago,

10:20.544 --> 10:22.502
and all her fake IDs

10:22.546 --> 10:24.678
are three years old, too.

10:24.722 --> 10:27.203
Okay, that gives us a timeline.

10:27.246 --> 10:29.486
But what's it all got to do
with our three murder victims

10:29.509 --> 10:31.250
- across Europe?
- I don't know yet.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.601
Could be that whatever this is all about

10:34.645 --> 10:36.821
started here.

10:36.865 --> 10:38.910
- And it needs to finish here.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:38.954 --> 10:40.912
Maybe. Know what?

10:40.956 --> 10:42.740
I'll have Sebastian see

10:42.783 --> 10:46.135
if he can connect our
victims to New Orleans.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.615
Hey, man, you know, it's been a while

10:48.659 --> 10:50.617

10:50.661 --> 10:53.098
Yeah, I guess it has.

10:53.142 --> 10:55.100
- Yeah.
- Be nice to catch up.

10:55.144 --> 10:57.494
And I also come prepared, baby.

10:57.537 --> 11:00.714

- Caffeine and fried foods.

11:00.758 --> 11:02.325
<i>Damn, I love</i>

11:02.368 --> 11:04.208
- a good stakeout.
<i>- But let's see how you feel</i>

11:04.209 --> 11:06.428
in the morning after the sun rises.

11:07.721 --> 11:10.811
I know. Just tell Naomi
that I'm really sorry, okay?

11:10.855 --> 11:12.455
And that I'll pick her up next practice.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.294
Thanks, Ryan.

11:15.338 --> 11:16.513
It's the 21st century.

11:16.556 --> 11:20.212
Why do we need wires
for anything anymore?

11:20.256 --> 11:22.256
Well, Patton says you can't
let a stakeout go south

11:22.257 --> 11:24.303
- because of a bad wireless connection.
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>

11:24.347 --> 11:27.741
Well, then, Patton should
invent a damn cord holder.

11:29.787 --> 11:32.659
It's got to be hard canceling
on Naomi because of work.

11:32.703 --> 11:35.619
Ryan tells her that her
mom's out saving the world.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.230
You are. Does she care?

11:38.274 --> 11:40.015
[CHUCKLES] I mean, sometimes.

11:40.058 --> 11:43.366
Other times, she puts
me in the penalty box,

11:43.409 --> 11:45.542
you know? No news from school.

11:45.585 --> 11:47.674
- No GIFs with cats on skateboards.
- [CHUCKLES]

11:47.718 --> 11:50.286
Losing those cat GIFs has got to hurt.

11:51.417 --> 11:53.767

11:53.811 --> 11:56.509

12:11.220 --> 12:13.439
No matter how clear I get it,

12:13.483 --> 12:16.616
I'm not gonna be able to
read it. It's just gibberish.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.184
<i>It's Albanian. I'm a little rusty,</i>

12:19.228 --> 12:21.148
but it's nothing an online
translator can't help.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.975
Well, I'll just stand here
and watch someone read.

12:28.802 --> 12:31.022
WADE: <i>How in the world</i>

12:31.066 --> 12:33.024
did my son convince you

12:33.068 --> 12:36.332
that a ride-along was a good
idea, Detective Holloway?

12:36.375 --> 12:40.379
CJ showed an incredible amount
of enthusiasm for a young man.

12:40.423 --> 12:42.251
He wore you down.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.556
Uh...

12:43.600 --> 12:46.782
CJ would be formidable
arguing in a courtroom.

12:46.825 --> 12:48.474
Yeah. He's persuasive.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.172
No, a breath of fresh air.

12:50.215 --> 12:52.217
We've been trying to get young people

12:52.261 --> 12:54.089
excited about our outreach programs,

12:54.132 --> 12:56.482
and CJ's article might actually help.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.137
See, that's what I was afraid of.

12:59.181 --> 13:01.792
- [SIGHS] Look, Detective Holloway...
- No, no, no.

13:01.835 --> 13:03.924
Gene. Please.

13:03.968 --> 13:05.926
Okay. Gene.

13:06.971 --> 13:09.060
You're clearly experienced,

13:09.104 --> 13:12.063
so you know how dangerous
a ride-along can be.

13:12.107 --> 13:14.805
[CHUCKLES] I'm not a beat cop, Dr. Wade.

13:14.848 --> 13:18.069
I only arrive after the
crime has been committed.

13:18.113 --> 13:19.723
I know what a detective does.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.333
Look, agreed.

13:21.377 --> 13:23.553
Taking a minor is a
little unconventional,

13:23.596 --> 13:25.772
but CJ impressed me.

13:25.816 --> 13:28.036
And I'll only be taking him on a tour.

13:28.079 --> 13:29.776
I won't respond to any calls.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.300
But even a ride-along can take a turn.

13:31.301 --> 13:32.779
Are you worried

13:32.823 --> 13:34.390
I'll get into an accident?

13:34.433 --> 13:37.175
[CHUCKLES] The chances
of that are so slim.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.612
Well, slim chances

13:39.656 --> 13:41.788
are all I deal with at the morgue.

13:41.832 --> 13:44.226
I know what a coroner does.

The thing is

13:50.101 --> 13:53.322

by danger every day.

13:53.365 --> 13:56.281
Ride-alongs only help
them be more prepared.

PATTON: <i>So, there I was

14:11.992 --> 14:13.690

to Lieutenant Simone

14:25.963 --> 14:27.747
At least, no connection that I can find.

15:37.339 --> 15:38.739

15:38.742 --> 15:40.462
It's a copy of Lieutenant
Simone's research.

15:40.463 --> 15:42.387
She found an unusually
high amount of sea bass

15:42.431 --> 15:44.259
that were dying off
the coast of Albania.

15:44.302 --> 15:47.218
Why would our assassin be
interested in dead sea bass?

15:47.262 --> 15:48.872
I don't know. But our dead doctor

15:48.915 --> 15:51.435

39:49.299 --> 39:52.476
Well, unfortunately,
ignoring the problem

39:52.519 --> 39:54.086
is never a long-term solution.

39:54.129 --> 39:57.350
<i>Usually makes things worse.</i>

39:57.394 --> 40:00.048
Friend of mine said the same thing.

40:00.092 --> 40:02.660
I haven't had a...

40:02.703 --> 40:04.488
full night's sleep in weeks.

40:04.531 --> 40:06.185
I'm exhausted.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.360
I just think it's time

40:07.404 --> 40:10.015
I stop running and confronted

40:10.058 --> 40:12.060
whatever it is that's haunting me.

40:13.627 --> 40:16.239
Well, I am happy to help, if I can.

40:18.066 --> 40:19.807
I was hoping you'd say that.

40:19.808 --> 40:23.258
