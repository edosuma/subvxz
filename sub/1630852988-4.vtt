A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:55.907 --> 01:57.909
CONTACTS

02:06.042 --> 02:09.045
<i>Hello?</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:10.964
<i>Hello?</i>

02:16.845 --> 02:18.263
Don't push me. What's your problem?

02:18.346 --> 02:20.515
-Relax.
-Move it!

02:22.433 --> 02:25.812
We'll see if Checho cares more
about his sister or his piece of ass.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.730
Take her to the hole.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.543
<i>Where does he live?</i>

02:49.335 --> 02:51.629
-I'm going there.
-What for?

02:51.713 --> 02:53.798
You told me you had the money.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.425
I told you I don't have it.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.718
Calm down, Liliana.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.803
I told you not to take that money
from your brother.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.764
Fuck. This is what happens
when you believe in stupid things.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.975
I fucked it up, dude.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.146
And that girl I brought to the park

03:10.023 --> 03:10.857
isn't my friend.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.319
She's a rich girl I met.

03:14.986 --> 03:18.114
We made a deal,
and she fucking let me down.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.116
Oh no, dude, and now Checho.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.492
And Ximena.

03:23.786 --> 03:27.749
I'm going to get that money somehow.
We'll get out of this together.

03:29.918 --> 03:30.919
Hello?

03:32.086 --> 03:33.504
No, I'm not with Ximena.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.299
Really?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.219
Are you sure?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.263
-Shit. They hurt Checho.
-What?

03:42.347 --> 03:43.556
Fuck!

03:43.640 --> 03:44.766
-How?
-I don't know.

03:44.849 --> 03:48.728
Jomi told me they stabbed a guy
who came to rob the place with scissors.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.566
Antonia, tell me
you have the fucking money.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.695
-I'm with Checho.
-How come you're with him? How is he?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.782
-We're taking him to a friend's.
-<i>Where does he live?</i>

04:00.865 --> 04:02.158
I'll send you the location.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.411
Vis, go faster. He's shaking. Checho.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.664
Checho, look at me.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.207
Look at me.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.843
Okay. What do we do?

04:20.927 --> 04:21.928
Got the needle?

04:22.679 --> 04:23.513
And thread?

04:24.013 --> 04:25.265
-Yes.
-Heat the needle.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.809
Am I doing it?

04:27.892 --> 04:28.935
Yes.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.276
Done.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.781
Let's go to a hospital.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.491
Dude, do it.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.076
Now. Don't think.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.412
-Go on, Vis. You can do it.
-Come on.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.663
One.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.206
-Two.
-Bear down.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.332
-Three.
-Bear down.

05:05.513 --> 05:06.556
Again. One.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.183
The police?

05:10.768 --> 05:11.602
No.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.106
-I'll get it.
-Go on.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.899
Let's go. One.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.609
Two.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.694
Three.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.322
-Who is it?
-Karina.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.744
-You have to stay still.
-Checho.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.288
-How are you?
-One.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.289
-All good.
-Two.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.665
-What's this?
-Go on.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.876
Look…

05:35.793 --> 05:36.794
This is serious.

05:37.378 --> 05:41.257
They took Ximena. If they don't get
the money, I don't know what'll happen.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.509
What do you mean, they took her?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.136
They kidnapped her.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.055
What?

05:47.555 --> 05:48.681
Are you kidding me?

05:55.646 --> 05:56.898
I'll get the money.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.649
It's okay.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.319
Don't worry. I'll do it.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.709
Hi.

06:19.587 --> 06:24.300
Listen, I need to ask you for a favor.
I really don't have anyone else I can ask.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.393
Walk.

06:42.985 --> 06:43.986
You can go.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.198
Are my friends outside?

06:48.699 --> 06:50.910
That's a problem that doesn't concern you.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.665
Let me explain something.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.712
This is how this business works, honey.
Don't take it personally, okay?

07:03.005 --> 07:07.260
If someone owes me money,
I have to take something from them.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.720
A sort of… guarantee.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.140
Understand me?

07:14.058 --> 07:16.310
Well, I'm a spectacular guarantee.

07:28.489 --> 07:32.034
Are you going home alone?
Or do you want the guy to take you?

07:33.077 --> 07:34.162
You take me.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.515
You act all serious, but…

07:55.725 --> 07:57.185
I can tell you're okay.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.563
You're cool, right?

08:03.608 --> 08:04.609
Listen to her.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.451
-Dude, did you bring what I asked?
-Of course, boss.

08:18.873 --> 08:19.874
Cool, thanks.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.421
You're nice enough to do me a favor, man.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.763
Or will you say no?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.648
You need to go to our neighborhood.

08:44.482 --> 08:48.486
Look. I don't know
if they saw me or suspect me,

08:49.529 --> 08:53.324
so you'd better go there, scope out
the place, and then let me know.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.201
Okay?

08:55.284 --> 08:58.120
You want me to leave you alone
with that preppie girl.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.498
That preppie girl saved my life.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.338
Do you hate me for what I did?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.048
What do you think?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.680
Obviously not, sweetie.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.515
You're my sister.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.394
No matter how much you fuck up,
I'd never hate you.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.188
I love you with all my heart.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.318
Hey.

09:30.111 --> 09:30.987
How are you?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.322
Well,

09:34.448 --> 09:35.449
a bit sore.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.619
Right, I'm leaving.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.204
Hey.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.207
Did you pack me some weed?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.126
Of course.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.922
Off you go, then.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.633
-Look after yourself.
-And you.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.927
-Anything happens, let me know.
-Sure.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.727
Hey!

10:02.810 --> 10:03.811
Hello, beautiful.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.981
-How are you?
-Why are you here?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.734
Me? I came to surprise Vicente.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.570
He told me he was busy
and couldn't see me.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.906
-I was just going.
-Did you bring Antonia?

10:16.407 --> 10:17.908
No. Is Antonia here?

10:18.451 --> 10:21.662
Were you involved in all this?
Is that why you're here?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.414
No, wait.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.001
I'm not involved
with whatever Antonia has done. I swear.

10:29.086 --> 10:33.215
I know something happened
that has to do with Antonia, Karina,

10:34.050 --> 10:35.718
and two and a half million pesos.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.679
I know because I paid that money.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.224
Could you please tell me

10:43.851 --> 10:46.145
what it was I bought or paid for?

10:46.228 --> 10:48.439
Because I swear I have no idea.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.734
Well…

10:52.735 --> 10:54.862
the truth is, you saved my brother's life.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.323
Okay.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.701
Okay.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.411
Is your brother here?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.039
Yes.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.874
Ah, okay.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.295
Need a ride?

11:13.923 --> 11:14.924
-Okay.
-Yeah?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.056
-Where are we going?
-The neighborhood.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.561
Girl, meet me at the viewpoint, okay?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.420

LIKED BY ANA12 AND 100 OTHERS

11:52.503 --> 11:54.380
ÁLEX
LIKE MY NEW LOOK? COMMENT.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.940
Oh fuck, Checho!

12:13.023 --> 12:14.316
-Stop.
-What's wrong?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.317
-Here?
-Yes, here.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.737
Where are you going?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.115
-I'll take you home. Where are you going?
-No, I'll get out here.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.160
Can you explain? What's going on?

12:24.243 --> 12:27.371
Do you have a problem with the police?
Or does Checho?

12:28.664 --> 12:32.168
The less you know about us,
the better it is for you.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.965
-Why don't I take you home?
-Thanks.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.112
<i>Hello.</i>

13:00.196 --> 13:03.741
Someone in your family works
for the police or has contacts, right?

13:03.824 --> 13:05.743
<i>Yes, of course. My uncle.</i>

13:14.168 --> 13:15.419
I'm glad you're okay.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.175
Girls, I know you're angry.

13:21.717 --> 13:26.055
I get it. What happened is really shitty.
But I did it to get us the money.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.391
We have the trip. We have the tickets,

13:29.934 --> 13:32.478
the concert.
We're going to give it our all.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.815
It's all gone to shit, Karina.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.901
I was wrong. I know I fucked up.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.778
I should have told you about Antonia,

13:40.861 --> 13:42.696
but I swear
I didn't do it to be an asshole.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.324
So for you, money justifies lying?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.786
-Dude, don't be unfair.
-It's not unfair.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.081
You make decisions
like you're the boss of Pura Kaye.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.834
What do I do? I look for opportunities.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.461
I agree.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.296
What?

13:59.797 --> 14:02.216
Speak up. You always agree with everyone.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.677
So what? I want to sort this out.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.762
While you look for any excuse to leave.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.097
Which excuse?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.808
You won't forgive
because you're going to your mom's.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.102
And you don't want the blame
for ditching us.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.230
You're going to your mom's
and weren't going to tell us.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.148
I see.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.776
And I'm the liar here, am I?

14:20.860 --> 14:24.697
Since when was not sharing
personal stuff the same as lying?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.532
You were going to ditch us.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.285
Is thinking about my future betrayal? No.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.329
We aren't going to make it, Karina.
We aren't anybody.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.414
We will be.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.835
Do you think people achieve things
just like that? That it comes for free?

14:37.918 --> 14:41.839
No. Obviously they have to
give it their all.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.758
Bust their ass, sacrifice a lot of things.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.511
I don't want to sacrifice anymore.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.683
I didn't know
you had so little faith in our dream.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.478
I have other dreams, dude.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.779
Pura Kaye is over for me.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.536
Be grateful Ximena doesn't know
your friend fucked Checho.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.624
You brought an enemy in.
What did you think would happen?

15:20.336 --> 15:21.545
It's fucked, Karina.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.778
Awesome.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.447
Great that you're dancing again.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.617
You know, family talent is never lost.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.120
So?

16:36.203 --> 16:37.997
Can I join your group?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.420
Hey, Kari, all good?

16:47.256 --> 16:48.257
All good.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.968
You're doing great.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.470
Thanks.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.853
Hi, Joy, it's Karina.
Sorry it's late, but I wanted to…

17:02.521 --> 17:06.692
Well, to thank you
for an amazing opportunity…

17:08.861 --> 17:11.488
and to say that we can't do the show.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.117
I'm sorry to tell you this
after everything, but…

17:17.202 --> 17:18.412
Pura Kaye is over.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.901
Where's your friend?

17:52.446 --> 17:53.447
I don't know.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.616
You and I have a deal.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.368
If she doesn't come, we can't start.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.287
How come?

18:06.126 --> 18:08.003
How did you do it?

18:08.962 --> 18:10.923
When will the papers be ready?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.007
Maybe next week.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.644
XIMENA
I'VE DONE IT.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.563
AS SOON AS I GET PAID,
I'LL BRING IT TO YOU. THANKS.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.326
Sorry.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.453
-See? She came.
-I'm sorry.

18:42.538 --> 18:47.000
I live really far away, but I've figured
it out so it won't happen again.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.255
This is an opportunity
you won't get again.

18:51.755 --> 18:52.756
Got it?

18:54.842 --> 18:55.843
It's all good.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.141
We have a month
until the first performance. No more.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.435
This is the moment
to lay everything down on the stage.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.899
I want to see Antonia,
María José, and Karina.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.360
Ready?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.698
Five, six, seven, eight, and go.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.550
Antonia, take a break.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.302
Let's go again.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.533
María José,

20:01.617 --> 20:03.118
I want to see just Karina.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.453
Take a break. Thanks.

20:10.959 --> 20:11.960
Do you have it?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.133
Alejandro, turn it up.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.096
Very good.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.777
I don't know whether to thank you or cry.
You did so well.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.073
Why'd you come?

21:24.866 --> 21:26.994
Not for you, if you want to know.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.414
So…?

21:31.790 --> 21:33.625
Don't tell me you like it here.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.793
I don't have a group.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.545
Pura Kaye is over.

21:38.088 --> 21:38.922
How come?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.925
I want to keep dancing.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.970
I want to focus on myself,
and if this is a chance,

21:45.846 --> 21:47.014
I want to take it.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.725
So we're going to end up competing.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.103
Well, I don't know if I can do

21:54.896 --> 21:58.108
everything you all do, but don't worry.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.068
I came to learn, not to take your place.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.280
Karina,

22:05.115 --> 22:07.284
I was going to hold up my end of the deal.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.495
I didn't know
about the trouble Checho was in,

22:11.747 --> 22:13.582
and it's shitty about your group.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.836
No, maybe you were the last straw.
Last night I realized

22:19.171 --> 22:21.006
we didn't have much of a future.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.717
Well then…

22:25.344 --> 22:26.595
Welcome to the Royal.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.057
How great to find you two together

22:30.140 --> 22:34.269
and to witness a sudden moment
of friendship between you.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.729
-Not today, Mateo.
-Wait.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.440
Lower your weapons.
I swear I come in peace.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.903
I was just talking
to some of the guys and girls

22:43.945 --> 22:45.906
about hanging at my place tonight

22:45.989 --> 22:49.534
with the excuse of studying
those videos that Jacobo sent us.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.662
Yes, I know those hangouts.

22:53.413 --> 22:58.126
Well, it seemed like a good excuse
to integrate our new classmate.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.837
For us to get to know you and you us.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.256
Oh, and two things.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.636
About the night at Al Garete,
sorry I called you a thief.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.430
I remember, and I'm embarrassed.
I can be an idiot.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.890
-I'm sorry.
-All good?

23:11.973 --> 23:14.226
-Yeah, all good. Honestly.
-All good.

23:16.353 --> 23:21.066
The second thing is Jacobo's calling you.
He needs you urgently.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.276
He was impressed with your flow.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.112
Amazing. Honestly.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.657
-Well, thanks.
-Well, you're welcome.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.326
I hope you come tonight.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.455
-What are you doing?
-With what?

23:37.457 --> 23:39.835
-What are you playing at?
-Nothing.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.671
I'm just sharing good vibes, that's all.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.049
I want everything to be okay.

23:47.259 --> 23:51.388
I would love for us to be able to leave
behind all the shit that happened.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.099
For you to come to my house
in good spirits.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.184
We can have a dance, have a drink.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.061
Maybe.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.772
Nothing. That was it.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.066
I'm sending you good vibes.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.821
Will you come tonight?

24:08.989 --> 24:10.323
-We'll see.
-We'll see.

24:19.958 --> 24:20.792
<i>Oof.</i>

24:20.876 --> 24:21.877
I don't know.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.381
You're not sure?
You have to be sure, Karina.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.467
This is your moment.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.845
Yes, and believe me,
what you're offering is awesome,

24:31.928 --> 24:33.555
but I don't know.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.639
But what?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.101
I'm here thanks to Antonia.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.353
And for me, loyalty is…

24:41.980 --> 24:43.899
It's everything. It's important--

24:43.982 --> 24:46.985
You're here because you're very talented.

24:49.696 --> 24:52.449
I'll give you until tomorrow
to give me an answer.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.950
And I want it to be a yes.

24:55.994 --> 24:56.870
Think carefully.

24:57.662 --> 24:58.663
Thank you.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.252
So what did he want?

25:04.336 --> 25:08.048
He wants me
to learn the choreography quickly.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.177
We have to agree about tonight.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.678
Mateo's thing.

25:14.804 --> 25:17.307
I think it'd be cool
if you met the others.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.893
Okay. Call me and let me know the plan.

25:19.976 --> 25:20.810
Sure.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.521
-Bye.
-Bye.

25:34.741 --> 25:41.706
CHECHO
LOVE YOU SWEETIE. WE'LL BE FINE.

25:43.166 --> 25:47.587
MATEO
MOBILE

25:54.719 --> 25:57.556
BOMBITA
GET READY. WE'RE GOING TO PARTY.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.600
What's all this?

26:00.684 --> 26:04.771
Chill. This mess is worth it.
We're going to party tonight with Bombi.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.023
Where are we going?

26:07.107 --> 26:09.651
Surprise, baby.
I won't take no for an answer.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.529
Fix yourself up.
This is a super special event.

26:12.612 --> 26:16.491
It sounds super boring, super awful.
I'm staying here.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.076
Ximena.

26:18.159 --> 26:22.706
We have to clear our heads a bit.
The group thing hit me hard too.

26:22.789 --> 26:25.584
If we're starting
with this again, I'm off.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.668
Come.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.588
Do it for both of us.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.757
You're leaving to see your mom soon.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.927
We don't know when we'll see each other.

26:37.971 --> 26:38.972
Girl,

26:40.098 --> 26:41.850
I'll never leave you.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.101
Look at me.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.061
Never.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.273
We'll video call each other.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.359
Video call isn't the same as face-to-face.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.362
Let's make
the next few days special, okay?

26:55.363 --> 26:56.489
Let's go.

26:57.949 --> 27:02.162
-Look, I have your outfit.
-Beg me again a bit. I'm not that easy.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.830
Come on.

27:04.706 --> 27:07.000
You might meet a guy
and forget about Checho.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.003
Don't talk about that asshole.
I'll do it for you, not him.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.213
I'm wearing this.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.299
I'll wear this. We'll be purple.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.145
XIMENA
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND CURRO KIDNAPPED ME

28:09.229 --> 28:10.480
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.611
You're so gorgeous, man.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.488
I'll be back soon.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.116
For real?

28:22.283 --> 28:26.162
I'm injured, and you're going out
with that Argentinian idiot.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.749
I'm not going out with him.
We're just watching some videos.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.251
Don't go.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.336
Stay here with me.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.798
Vis, shall we go?

28:37.716 --> 28:38.717
I'm not going.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.553
What? And the show?

28:41.636 --> 28:42.470
Well,

28:43.054 --> 28:44.347
I have things to do.

28:46.349 --> 28:47.183
See?

28:49.060 --> 28:51.020
Stay. Come on.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.105
See you in a bit.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.776
-Take care.
-I won't be long.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.486
-Okay.
-Get some rest.

29:06.911 --> 29:07.912
Dude.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.581
One question.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.211
Does that guy live far from here?

29:16.463 --> 29:17.464
Why?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.258
I want you to do me a favor.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.767
VICENTE
CHANGE OF PLANS!

29:32.353 --> 29:34.856
ÁLEX
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

30:22.195 --> 30:25.156
And Mateo's parents?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.242
In Argentina.

30:28.034 --> 30:32.080
They lived here, but when they left
Mateo had already gotten into the Royal,

30:32.163 --> 30:33.540
and he decided to stay.

30:34.207 --> 30:37.710
-They left him the house.
-Wow. Poor him.

30:38.628 --> 30:42.966
Hey! I'm glad you're here.
I thought it wouldn't happen.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.052
Welcome back to my house. Come in.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.723
Make yourselves at home.
Have a drink, some food.

30:51.599 --> 30:52.600
Here.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.936
So you're on our level.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.483
So which of these has been spiked?

31:00.567 --> 31:01.901
Both.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.822
Chill. I just wanted us to have fun.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.782
Shall we watch the videos now?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.659
-Yeah.
-The screen is set up.

31:09.742 --> 31:12.704
Whenever you want, go ahead.
We saw some of them already.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.915
I feel like smoking right now.
You can go whenever you want.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.751
Mateo being Mateo.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.647
Hey, you came!

31:39.731 --> 31:42.275
The queens of the night,
my surprise guests.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.362
And they're good friends
of our new classmate Karina.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.531
Welcome, girls.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.993
For everyone who doesn't know them,
they are Pura Kaye.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.078
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.540
-All good?
-How are you?

31:57.624 --> 31:59.876
Good. What's this music? Can we change it?

31:59.959 --> 32:04.422
Yes, of course we can. You can come
with me in a sec, and we'll change it.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.299
I don't get it.

32:06.966 --> 32:07.926
What's wrong?

32:08.676 --> 32:12.096
I thought it was a good idea
to invite them, hang out.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.767
Maybe they can help us
with the flow we need for the show.

32:15.850 --> 32:16.851
What do you think?

32:18.311 --> 32:19.729
Is it a good idea?

32:20.396 --> 32:21.397
Yeah, it is.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.275
-What do you want to drink? Come.
-Of course.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.777
My house is your house.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.280
I didn't know.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.915
It's bad that I was so upset yesterday,

32:38.998 --> 32:41.626
and I get here
and see you with your new best friend.

32:41.709 --> 32:42.877
What best friend?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.047
You.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.424
You're my best friend.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.511
Why am I upset that you can't forgive me?

32:51.594 --> 32:54.555
And that you thought
I did it to be an asshole.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.435
Dude, you and I are sisters, babe.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.354
-Exactly.
-Well then.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.065
-Won't you forgive me?
-Why are you laughing?

33:06.192 --> 33:11.239
MATEO
ALL READY, SERGEANT. IT'S TIME.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.008
-What--
-On the floor.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.968
On the floor!

33:32.051 --> 33:34.095
-What's going on?
-Vicente.

33:34.178 --> 33:37.223
Vicente! It's all good, dude.

33:37.306 --> 33:38.933
-Okay.
-Who is Sergio Parra?

33:39.017 --> 33:41.102
-Who?
-Who is Sergio Parra?

33:41.185 --> 33:42.311
Who, officer?

33:42.395 --> 33:45.398
There's no Sergio Parra here.
Look at our papers.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.526
There's a bag of drugs here, Sergeant.

36:09.876 --> 36:14.547
