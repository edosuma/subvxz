WEBVTT

01:09.027 --> 01:11.020
- Up yours!
- Get out of the way!

02:30.116 --> 02:31.527
Fine time piece, brother?

02:33.412 --> 02:34.527
Goodbye.

03:24.677 --> 03:28.675
"Who's the black private dick
that's a sex machine to all the chicks?

03:29.432 --> 03:30.463
"Shaft

03:31.018 --> 03:32.346
"Damn right

03:40.444 --> 03:44.858
"Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

03:45.491 --> 03:46.523
"Shaft

03:47.202 --> 03:48.612
"Can you dig it?

03:56.462 --> 04:00.461
"Who's the cat that won't cop out
when there's danger all about?

04:01.468 --> 04:02.547
"Shaft

04:02.928 --> 04:04.090
"Right on

04:05.263 --> 04:07.505
"They say this cat is a bad mother

04:07.599 --> 04:08.678
"Shut your mouth

04:08.767 --> 04:10.143
"I'm talking about Shaft

04:10.228 --> 04:11.888
"Then we can dig it

04:12.021 --> 04:14.061
"He's a complicated man

04:14.148 --> 04:15.144
"No one understands him

04:15.900 --> 04:17.892
"But his woman

04:17.985 --> 04:19.396
"John Shaft"

04:19.738 --> 04:21.363
What's happening, Marty?

04:21.447 --> 04:23.904
Same old sixes and sevens, Shaft.

04:23.992 --> 04:28.120
Two guys were looking for you
like 10 minutes ago.

04:28.247 --> 04:29.576
Harlem cats?

04:29.958 --> 04:34.454
How the hell should I know?
Everybody looks the same to me.

04:36.422 --> 04:37.881
Take it easy, Marty.

04:38.299 --> 04:39.711
Take care, Shaft.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.556
Thanks, brother.

05:28.187 --> 05:30.146
Too much sugar this morning.

05:31.025 --> 05:32.483
Then don't drink it, baby.

05:34.695 --> 05:37.447
A couple of dudes from uptown
looking for you.

05:38.867 --> 05:39.981
Know them?

05:41.077 --> 05:42.275
Not by name.

05:42.829 --> 05:46.328
Seen them around uptown.
Come in here when I was opening up.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.119
Asked where they could find you.

05:49.712 --> 05:51.254
What did they look like?

05:51.339 --> 05:54.589
One was wearing a funky plaid coat.
Other one was sharp.

05:55.676 --> 05:59.296
$50 shoes. Black coat, gray flares.

06:01.516 --> 06:03.758
- Is that all?
- They had heat on them.

06:04.061 --> 06:07.180
The one in the plaid coat
had his hands in his pocket.

06:07.357 --> 06:09.396
Pulled his coat tight, you dig?

06:10.985 --> 06:13.061
Had some heavy iron in his belt.

06:13.488 --> 06:16.193
You got a scuff on the
toe of this left shoe.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.623
What time you got, Tom?

06:25.251 --> 06:26.199
8:16.

06:30.507 --> 06:34.635
Pull over in front of that shoe-shine
parlor. He usually hangs out there.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.841
Okay.

06:41.227 --> 06:43.682
- You want me to go in?
- No. We'll wait.

06:48.068 --> 06:52.481
Got yourself a nice shine. You can go out
and make something of yourself, man.

06:54.616 --> 06:58.615
Go out and get rich and fat like you?
We're straight, baby.

07:03.626 --> 07:05.120
Got a minute, Shaft?

07:05.253 --> 07:09.252
Got no use for no dirty postcards, Vic.
Get off my back.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.341
I just want to talk to you.

07:11.427 --> 07:13.799
Call me up. You know my number.

07:16.308 --> 07:20.008
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Go sit in the park a minute?

07:20.103 --> 07:23.270
Hell, no. Just tell me
what you got to say right here!

07:24.399 --> 07:27.686
Tom, go get us two cigars.
What kind do you smoke?

07:27.904 --> 07:29.980
Just say what you've got to say.

07:31.908 --> 07:34.280
Get us a couple of El Garcia's.

07:38.457 --> 07:39.916
Look, I'm late.

07:40.876 --> 07:43.034
What are you trying to lay on me?

07:43.128 --> 07:45.834
Just love, Shaft.
Nothing but love and sympathy.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.090
Then we're even. Go on, get on with it.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.263
I thought you might know something
I want to know.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.639
Seems there's been a lot of low,
quiet rumbles going on uptown.

07:55.726 --> 07:59.593
Our people have been able to pick up
the sounds of it, but not words.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.892
That's 'cause us black folk
talk mush mouth, Lieutenant.

08:04.778 --> 08:06.320
I thought we'd get to it.

08:06.404 --> 08:10.188
We did. But, you want me to pigeon.
I just said, "Up yours, baby."

08:12.494 --> 08:15.864
How come two cats from Harlem
came downtown this morning...

08:15.957 --> 08:17.748
...looking for John Shaft?

08:19.377 --> 08:23.077
They're soul brothers. They came down
so I could teach them the handshake.

08:24.883 --> 08:26.128
They find you?

08:26.218 --> 08:28.045
Of course, I wasn't hiding.

08:29.388 --> 08:32.970
If you find out anything, give me a call.
I'm still at the 38th Precinct.

08:34.059 --> 08:35.222
Right on.

08:36.563 --> 08:38.520
Where the hell are you going?

08:39.732 --> 08:42.354
To get laid. Where the hell are you going?

08:47.825 --> 08:50.150
That boy's got a lot of mouth on him.

08:54.583 --> 08:57.074
The boy's man enough to back it up, too.

08:58.461 --> 09:00.086
What did he tell you?

09:00.547 --> 09:01.578
Nothing.

09:02.090 --> 09:03.834
Got to lean on that kind.

09:04.802 --> 09:06.711
You don't lean on that kind.

09:10.391 --> 09:12.134
Give me a package of gum.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.097
Make a noise, I'll cut you. Back up.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.859
- Something wrong, Mr. Shaft?
- Sick friend here.

09:56.943 --> 09:58.900
Jim, can you get us a car up?

10:03.867 --> 10:05.409
I'll take that.

10:07.162 --> 10:08.621
Now, be cool, man.

10:20.134 --> 10:21.795
Where is your partner?

10:31.188 --> 10:32.434
Open the door.

11:17.990 --> 11:22.202
You've got about a half a minute
to tell me what the hell you want with me.

11:22.287 --> 11:26.237
The police will ask why you threw
that son of a bitch out the window.

11:27.167 --> 11:30.786
They can find you dead or alive.
Now, what's your goddamn story?

11:31.797 --> 11:32.877
Bumpy...

11:33.925 --> 11:36.498
Bumpy says to bring you uptown.

11:37.011 --> 11:39.004
Did he tell you to mess me up?

11:41.683 --> 11:43.177
I was to bring you.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.650
It doesn't make sense.

11:49.734 --> 11:52.735
You arrive at your office.
You have a sick friend with you.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.106
Suddenly, another man you don't know
rushes up and a fight starts.

11:56.241 --> 11:59.325
Your sick friend goes out the window.
Why, Mr. Shaft?

12:00.412 --> 12:03.283
Ask the man who started the fight,
Mr. Leibowitz.

12:03.457 --> 12:06.162
Your friend, the only name
you know him by is "Tex"?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.202
- No last name?
- That's right.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.672
I don't buy that, Shaft.

12:09.756 --> 12:13.670
I think you know more than that.
Why the fight started, for instance.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.844
What you think and what you can prove
are two different bags.

12:20.393 --> 12:23.228
All your friends walk around
with weapons like that?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.761
That depends.

12:25.856 --> 12:28.942
My Negro friends don't walk around
with rabbits' feet no more.

12:29.194 --> 12:32.230
Don't get wise with me.
There's a simple way for me to go.

12:32.364 --> 12:36.148
- I'll put your goddamn ass in! - I'll
sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.

12:36.243 --> 12:39.328
You want me to believe the man fell out
the way you said he did?

12:39.414 --> 12:43.494
- What do I look like? Some kind of klutz?
- Don't ask, and I won't tell you.

12:43.585 --> 12:45.910
You're licensed by the city and the state.

12:46.045 --> 12:49.747
No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass
where a felony case is involved.

12:50.134 --> 12:52.007
Are you suggesting I'd lose my license?

12:52.094 --> 12:55.261
You are damn right I am!
You better believe it and level with me!

12:56.181 --> 12:59.302
Threatening my livelihood is a violation
of my rights, isn't it?

13:03.940 --> 13:05.055
Byron...

13:08.613 --> 13:11.104
Let me have a talk with him in private.

13:12.742 --> 13:14.983
You got an assailant to interview.

13:15.119 --> 13:17.444
Start that and I'll join after we talk.

13:17.538 --> 13:21.240
I think you are b.s.-ing me, too.
This thing stinks.

13:39.021 --> 13:41.938
Maybe he didn't like the handshake
you taught him.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.777
You know you can get your rump
in a sling for this mess?

13:46.862 --> 13:49.781
- Static, a lot of hassle.
- You'll save me, Vic.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.194
Well, I can try.

13:52.452 --> 13:53.282
If?

13:54.371 --> 13:56.197
One hand washes the other.

13:56.999 --> 14:00.997
All the hassle in the world wouldn't
make me sing a song to the police.

14:01.963 --> 14:02.958
No way, baby.

14:04.799 --> 14:07.884
That cat you threw out the window
was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas.

14:09.054 --> 14:11.343
I didn't throw no cat
out no window, Lieutenant.

14:11.431 --> 14:13.258
Bumpy isn't gonna like it.

14:13.767 --> 14:17.054
I don't care what he likes!
What the hell are you pumping me for?

14:17.146 --> 14:19.388
Two weeks ago
we started picking up rumbles.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.984
- You already said that.
- We know it's not the Panthers.

14:25.113 --> 14:28.031
Or the Young Lords.
But, something's on the boil.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.945
I want to know what it is...

14:31.078 --> 14:34.328
...before we need an adding machine
to count the bodies.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.492
Bumpy wants you for something.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.912
He knows what's going on.
And that's what I want to know.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.047
Not who, just what.

14:43.341 --> 14:47.422
It warms my black heart to see you
so concerned about us minority folks.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.048
Come on, Shaft.
What is it with this black shit?

14:55.229 --> 14:56.772
You ain't so black.

14:58.567 --> 15:00.809
And you ain't so white, baby.

15:03.780 --> 15:04.812
All right.

15:05.950 --> 15:08.737
You want to play
your super heavy black number.

15:10.622 --> 15:12.246
I'm gonna play mine.

15:13.499 --> 15:17.747
We can nail your tail for manslaughter
with what we've got on you right now!

15:18.380 --> 15:22.460
You can waltz Leibowitz, but you
know the law. You could be charged.

15:23.177 --> 15:24.719
Charged, Lieutenant.

15:24.804 --> 15:27.212
Yeah, but your license'll be suspended.

15:27.557 --> 15:30.095
You'll be out of business for six months.

15:31.144 --> 15:33.433
You want to be out of business
for six months?

15:34.397 --> 15:35.857
Out on the street.

15:35.942 --> 15:38.349
No gun permit. Six months!

15:39.320 --> 15:42.985
With Bumpy looking for you
when all hell's about to break loose?

15:43.074 --> 15:44.450
You want it, you got it.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.036
You scare me to death, Lieutenant.

15:48.121 --> 15:52.036
You're buying trouble not only for
yourself, but a blood bath up in Harlem.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.074
You want that?

15:55.630 --> 15:58.797
All I'm asking you is to let me know
what's going on!

15:59.217 --> 16:01.340
No names, no places, just what!

16:04.473 --> 16:06.549
I'm not asking you to sell out.

16:08.852 --> 16:11.343
Tell me the name of the game,
so I know the rules.

16:27.373 --> 16:28.915
I'll think about it.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.167
All right, I'll settle for that now.

16:34.089 --> 16:37.707
That buys you 48 hours on the street,
and then we're gonna talk again.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.547
You got the number
of Bumpy's private phone?

16:44.017 --> 16:45.048
All right.

16:45.935 --> 16:48.177
Take off. I'll see to Leibowitz.

16:50.523 --> 16:51.686
Right on.

16:53.652 --> 16:54.897
I'll see you.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.659
Look at that.

17:43.499 --> 17:46.619
- Wrong number.
- Don't bull me, I got the right number.

17:46.710 --> 17:47.908
This is Shaft.

17:48.003 --> 17:49.877
How did you get this number?

17:49.964 --> 17:52.634
Off a bathroom wall
in the goddamn subway.

17:53.093 --> 17:54.717
I'm looking for you.

17:55.136 --> 17:56.631
I've got an office.

18:08.985 --> 18:10.265
Here you are.

18:10.653 --> 18:11.685
Thanks.

18:11.863 --> 18:14.568
Bag of chestnuts, please.
Cold as hell today, huh?

18:14.866 --> 18:17.536
Yeah, yeah. Good chestnuts.

18:19.579 --> 18:20.694
How much?

18:20.789 --> 18:21.953
Two bits.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.998
- Here you go. Take it easy.
- Thanks.

18:24.085 --> 18:25.248
Hey, taxi!

18:30.634 --> 18:32.342
What the hell is this?

18:33.262 --> 18:34.673
You white mother!

18:37.266 --> 18:38.464
Taxi! Taxi!

19:23.692 --> 19:26.314
Cat say he gonna be here,
he should be here.

19:26.445 --> 19:27.608
Open it up.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.347
Cat say he gonna be here...

20:00.066 --> 20:01.477
...and he ain't.

20:03.653 --> 20:05.811
It ain't right, Boss.

20:07.448 --> 20:08.778
We'll wait.

20:12.037 --> 20:13.864
You take crap off of him...

20:14.290 --> 20:16.199
...he'll give you more crap.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.748
We'll wait.

20:19.796 --> 20:21.539
That's some cold shit...

20:23.091 --> 20:25.629
...throwing my man, Leroy,
out the window.

20:26.803 --> 20:30.671
Just picked my man up, and threw him
out the goddamned window.

20:32.435 --> 20:35.886
Got us standing around and waiting
to say thank you.

20:41.820 --> 20:43.896
Glad you let yourself in, Bumpy.

20:45.699 --> 20:48.487
Give me a bad name,
have you hanging around in the hall.

20:51.456 --> 20:53.662
If the man ever comes down here...

20:54.375 --> 20:56.083
...again to see you...

20:56.794 --> 20:58.954
...you make sure you be here.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.122
Waiting.

21:02.092 --> 21:03.587
You're in my chair.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.276
Wait outside.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.783
Sims and Leroy tried to muscle you, Shaft?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.958
Well, I got no grudge about Leroy.

21:41.427 --> 21:42.838
I couldn't give a damn.

21:43.179 --> 21:44.424
I got a job for you.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.349
I'm not on the hustle, Bumpy.

21:47.643 --> 21:48.722
A detective job.

21:51.021 --> 21:53.180
- What kind?
- Your kind. You take it.

21:54.942 --> 21:57.268
Don't jive me. What are you talking about?

21:57.362 --> 21:59.734
Somebody kidnapped my daughter, Marcy.

21:59.948 --> 22:01.775
Done in a couple of people.

22:01.866 --> 22:05.235
Didn't leave no ransom note or nothing.
Nobody saw nothing.

22:06.038 --> 22:08.825
I want you to find her.
That's the fucking job.

22:11.252 --> 22:13.161
The police do that for free.

22:13.629 --> 22:16.300
Not for me. You know I can't go
to the cops.

22:17.426 --> 22:18.836
And you want me?

22:19.803 --> 22:21.048
The spade detective.

22:21.430 --> 22:24.384
Yeah, I want you 'cause
you're a black spade detective.

22:24.474 --> 22:29.137
I want you 'cause you got your other foot
in whitey's trough! She can be anywhere.

22:32.025 --> 22:33.649
Got any idea who grabbed her?

22:36.030 --> 22:37.903
A lot of cats hate my guts.

22:39.408 --> 22:42.195
A sweet, loving dude like you?

22:43.662 --> 22:45.371
Sweet talking a man's lady...

22:45.498 --> 22:49.081
...as you beat her man out of his paycheck
in the back room of a horse parlor?

22:49.169 --> 22:51.375
Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm?

22:53.965 --> 22:55.793
Who could hate you, Bumpy?

22:56.552 --> 23:00.597
My baby never sold nothing to nobody.
Never took nothing from nobody.

23:01.766 --> 23:04.518
She's a straight kid.
She's going to college.

23:07.189 --> 23:09.894
Whoever grabbed her, got her to get at me.

23:11.234 --> 23:14.604
They have a beef with me,
they should come to me.

23:16.115 --> 23:18.689
So you got a rule
that somebody else don't.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.083
Is that all you know?

23:26.168 --> 23:30.296
There's a piece of Harlem I can't get at.
The one them militants got their arm on.

23:31.173 --> 23:34.625
They could have my baby.
She's been into some of that stuff.

23:35.428 --> 23:38.215
Bunch calls themselves the "La Mumba's."

23:38.974 --> 23:40.468
Ben Buford's thing.

23:41.601 --> 23:43.642
I could send my people to ask them.

23:44.855 --> 23:45.851
Shit.

23:46.774 --> 23:51.103
It'd come to a shootout and when
it's all over, a bunch of dead cats.

23:52.863 --> 23:54.442
And maybe they'd kill Marcy.

23:57.619 --> 23:59.659
Yeah, you're Papa pimp to them.

24:01.039 --> 24:04.456
They want to see you burn
as bad as they want to see the police burn.

24:04.961 --> 24:07.416
But kidnapping sisters,
that ain't their thing.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.464
The only reason anybody grabs
anybody for is money.

24:10.591 --> 24:14.804
What other bunch in Harlem needs money
bad enough to grab my baby?

24:14.888 --> 24:18.838
If you believe that, what's all this
about me having a foot in whitey's trough?

24:18.934 --> 24:22.101
I said I think they had her.
I didn't say they had her in Harlem.

24:22.187 --> 24:24.893
They ain't dumb enough
to take her someplace uptown.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.105
It don't lay right.

24:28.236 --> 24:31.272
What the hell you think I need you for
if I knew who had her?

24:33.701 --> 24:34.981
I'm guessing.

24:36.203 --> 24:38.529
If they don't have her, all right.

24:38.831 --> 24:40.622
Maybe they know something.

24:41.709 --> 24:43.121
I got nothing.

24:43.962 --> 24:45.587
That's the job, Shaft.

24:48.175 --> 24:49.550
Will you take it, or no?

24:54.098 --> 24:55.758
I get $50 an hour.

24:57.018 --> 24:58.263
Plus expenses.

25:00.355 --> 25:02.597
And no questions asked
about how I spend it.

25:04.026 --> 25:05.188
You got it.

25:05.402 --> 25:07.940
I get a free hand to move any way I want.

25:12.452 --> 25:14.112
You find my baby.

25:17.290 --> 25:18.749
That's all I want.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.166
I got money.

25:25.466 --> 25:26.711
You spend it.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.339
And you find her.

25:43.695 --> 25:45.403
That'll get you started.

26:04.342 --> 26:06.134
When will I hear from you?

26:10.307 --> 26:12.217
When I got something to say.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.264
One more thing:

26:19.358 --> 26:23.986
You send another cat after me with a gun,
I'll kill him and I'll come looking for you!

26:25.198 --> 26:26.990
And I'll get you, Bumpy.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.481
You believe it.

26:51.353 --> 26:52.598
Fake mother.

27:01.405 --> 27:04.774
"Black man born free"

27:04.909 --> 27:06.700
You seen Ben Buford around?

27:06.827 --> 27:09.319
"The way it's supposed to be

27:09.414 --> 27:13.032
"Chains that bind him are hard to see

27:13.710 --> 27:17.044
"Unless you take this walk with me

27:18.048 --> 27:20.540
"The place where he lives

27:21.636 --> 27:25.634
"It's got plenty of names
'Slums"'

27:26.474 --> 27:29.476
Ben Buford used to live here.
He live here anymore?

27:30.354 --> 27:31.385
No, why?

27:32.189 --> 27:33.767
I'm looking for him.

27:33.857 --> 27:36.431
I am, too. He owes me six months' rent.

27:38.112 --> 27:39.523
Take it easy.

27:42.534 --> 27:45.700
"Any kind of job is hard to find

27:46.037 --> 27:49.205
"And that means an increase
in the welfare line

27:50.084 --> 27:53.085
"Crime rate is rising too

27:54.296 --> 27:57.297
"If you are hungry, what would you do?

27:58.468 --> 28:01.469
"Rent is two months past due

28:02.431 --> 28:05.467
"And the building is falling apart

28:06.727 --> 28:09.894
"Little boy who needs a pair of shoes"

28:14.986 --> 28:18.403
Hello, ma'am. I'm looking for a guy
named Ben Buford. You know him?

28:18.490 --> 28:19.866
Yeah, I know him.

28:19.950 --> 28:22.785
- Seen him around here lately?
- Not in a long while.

28:22.870 --> 28:26.036
"Some of the brothers got plenty of cash

28:26.957 --> 28:30.125
"Chicks on the corner gonna see to that

28:30.879 --> 28:34.045
"Some like to smoke, some like to blow

28:35.008 --> 28:38.176
"Some even strung out on a $50 jones

28:39.764 --> 28:42.599
"Some are trying to ditch reality

28:43.934 --> 28:46.604
"By getting so, so high

28:47.898 --> 28:53.058
"Only to find out
that you can never touch the sky"

28:53.195 --> 28:55.768
I'm looking for Ben Buford.
You seen him around?

28:55.906 --> 28:57.698
No, I ain't seen him.

28:58.659 --> 28:59.691
Thanks.

29:00.745 --> 29:03.034
Know what the number was today?

29:03.706 --> 29:06.281
"Every Sunday morning

29:06.585 --> 29:09.871
"I can hear the old sisters say

29:10.422 --> 29:14.337
"Hallelujah, hallelujah

29:14.468 --> 29:16.343
"Trust in the Lord

29:16.429 --> 29:18.422
"He'll make a way

29:20.141 --> 29:22.976
"I hope that he hears their prayers

"'Cause deep in their souls they believe

29:28.943 --> 29:31.101
"Someday he'll put an end

"To all this misery

29:34.949 --> 29:37.108
- "That's in
- Soulsville

29:43.500 --> 29:45.160
"Soulsville"

30:04.314 --> 30:06.557
- What's happening?
- Man, how's it going?

30:06.651 --> 30:07.730
Seen Ben?

30:08.987 --> 30:10.398
Ben? Ben who?

30:11.072 --> 30:12.899
Ben Buford. You know who I mean.

30:13.783 --> 30:16.536
Look, man, I don't know no Ben Buford.

30:18.289 --> 30:19.154
$20.

30:20.499 --> 30:22.207
That Ben Buford.

30:22.710 --> 30:25.878
He's holed up on a place
on Amsterdam, 710.

30:27.007 --> 30:28.881
What apartment and what time?

30:29.259 --> 30:32.593
Third floor. There's a meeting at 9:00.

30:33.555 --> 30:35.134
I can't guarantee it.

30:35.933 --> 30:38.389
I just heard some cat tell another cat.

30:39.479 --> 30:41.555
They're both in the movement with Ben.

30:43.983 --> 30:45.941
Yeah, well, stay loose, baby.

31:16.728 --> 31:18.104
You all right?

31:19.106 --> 31:20.814
Baby, are you all right?

31:22.275 --> 31:26.025
I got to feeling like a machine.
That's no way to feel.

31:30.243 --> 31:31.785
Come here, baby.

32:45.201 --> 32:47.822
Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.575
What're you having?

32:50.706 --> 32:52.499
A dog with mustard and onions.

32:53.502 --> 32:54.367
No.

32:54.461 --> 32:55.836
Hold the onions.

32:59.508 --> 33:00.503
Cold, huh?

33:05.640 --> 33:07.383
Well, John, what did you get?

33:14.441 --> 33:15.770
I got laid.

33:36.090 --> 33:39.673
Uptown, brother. Amsterdam Avenue.
Take your time. I'm early.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.277
Champ, you lost?

34:33.487 --> 34:34.317
No.

34:35.405 --> 34:36.947
You live around here?

34:37.032 --> 34:37.981
Yeah.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.697
You look cold.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.120
Get something to eat.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.838
Gee, thanks, mister.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.501
Okay, champ.

36:11.928 --> 36:13.838
- Who is it?
- John Shaft, Ben.

36:33.202 --> 36:36.987
Unless you want more visitors,
better split up that pair out front.

36:39.209 --> 36:41.248
Put somebody on the basement door.

36:42.295 --> 36:43.623
How did you find me?

36:43.713 --> 36:46.252
Wasn't hard. You got a big mouth.

36:48.344 --> 36:50.751
- Cool it, man.
- You cool it, boy.

36:54.183 --> 36:56.889
Don't let your mouth
get your ass in trouble.

36:59.439 --> 37:02.109
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Don't jive me.

37:04.361 --> 37:08.360
- We've put in a lot of street time
together. - That was a long time back.

37:08.741 --> 37:10.533
I don't know you no more.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.945
A lot of hard years, man.
The kind you don't forget.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.827
Now, I'm gonna give you one minute
to say what you came here to say.

37:23.048 --> 37:26.798
Then you go back out that door
you came in or I'll throw you out.

37:29.139 --> 37:30.681
You know Marcy Jonas?

37:30.765 --> 37:32.888
- Yeah, why?
- You know where she is?

37:33.393 --> 37:35.766
- What do you mean?
- Somebody grabbed her.

37:37.148 --> 37:39.140
Bumpy thinks maybe it was you.

37:42.194 --> 37:44.234
We don't do that kind of thing.

37:44.405 --> 37:46.280
You know anything about it?

37:47.993 --> 37:50.235
Tom, you used up your minute. Get out!

37:50.328 --> 37:51.823
Don't "Tom" me, man!

37:52.497 --> 37:54.324
- Where are the guns?
- None here.

37:54.417 --> 37:55.911
I'll be goddamned!

37:59.672 --> 38:01.416
Sonny! Sonny!

38:01.758 --> 38:02.789
They're coming!

38:02.925 --> 38:04.634
- Up on the roof?
- Yeah. Go!

38:08.056 --> 38:09.052
He's dead.

38:09.141 --> 38:10.552
Come on, come on!

38:11.769 --> 38:13.560
Not the roof, this way!

38:22.322 --> 38:23.484
Stand back.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.109
- What is this?
- Everything will be fine.

38:27.244 --> 38:30.162
- What is this?
- Go over there and be quiet.

39:21.011 --> 39:23.800
Everything's okay, ma'am.
No need to worry.

39:25.559 --> 39:27.136
Sorry about your door.

39:27.561 --> 39:29.304
That'll take care of it.

39:31.314 --> 39:32.810
You set us up, man!

39:35.069 --> 39:36.694
Young man, please.

39:37.864 --> 39:39.144
Don't do that.

39:39.407 --> 39:44.319
Don't ever threaten me again!
And don't call me Judas!

40:26.167 --> 40:29.287
Come on. It's no time
to count your dead. Come on!

40:45.396 --> 40:46.345
Look.

40:53.656 --> 40:54.770
Come on!

41:00.622 --> 41:02.164
This way, this way!

41:06.336 --> 41:07.665
One of yours?

41:09.005 --> 41:10.833
- No.
- Probably a finger man.

41:27.151 --> 41:30.817
When you lead that revolution,
whitey better be standing still...

41:31.406 --> 41:33.612
...'cause you don't run
worth a damn no more!

41:33.741 --> 41:35.117
We're done running, man.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.573
What the hell do you call this, man?

41:57.976 --> 42:01.013
I got to find out if
they're after you or me.

42:11.909 --> 42:14.993
I'll leave you with some friends.
They're straight people.

42:15.329 --> 42:18.365
So don't you lay any of
that Uncle Tom jive on them.

42:24.839 --> 42:28.838
I don't know what's connected to what.
I can't piece them together.

42:28.928 --> 42:30.126
Answer that.

42:31.138 --> 42:35.634
It's only a half an hour since it happened.
How could I have something this soon?

42:36.685 --> 42:41.479
I'm not paid enough to worry about what
the Commissioner or the Mayor thinks!

42:41.817 --> 42:43.975
It's Shaft. You want to talk to him?

42:44.069 --> 42:46.690
I got a call. I might have something.
Hold on.

42:46.988 --> 42:48.947
No, better I call you back.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.744
I'm coming to see you.

42:54.455 --> 42:56.448
You've been holding out on me.

42:56.833 --> 43:00.285
I'll wait. Listen, several cats
were killed in Harlem.

43:00.379 --> 43:02.003
You know anything about it?

43:02.089 --> 43:03.880
I was there, Lieutenant.

43:13.768 --> 43:18.063
The Captain's at home. Call him back.
Tell him I left to chase down a lead.

43:18.232 --> 43:21.518
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Just get him off my back.

43:21.610 --> 43:24.232
A reporter from the News
wants an interview.

43:25.239 --> 43:28.691
Tell him to call the Captain.
Serves the old bastard right.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.611
This is that list
from the intelligence section.

43:32.914 --> 43:34.290
What about the pictures?

43:34.374 --> 43:37.661
They're getting them together now.
Said about five minutes.

43:37.753 --> 43:40.327
Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.

43:55.189 --> 43:58.475
Dina'll get you a bed made up.
Why don't you get some sleep, man?

44:00.570 --> 44:02.895
Got some dead brothers laying out there.

44:03.740 --> 44:05.649
And this ain't where I should be.

44:06.076 --> 44:09.576
Till we find out why they're dead,
this is the only place for you to be!

44:09.914 --> 44:11.491
You think like a white man!

44:11.582 --> 44:13.160
You don't think! You want to get wasted?

44:13.250 --> 44:14.792
If that's what it takes!

44:14.877 --> 44:16.835
Marvin's sleeping.

44:22.886 --> 44:25.758
I'll find out what I can and pick you up
in the morning.

44:26.849 --> 44:29.174
If you think I'll owe you for this,
you're wrong.

44:29.310 --> 44:30.888
You got nothing I want!

44:32.897 --> 44:34.724
You can have the girls' room.

44:39.321 --> 44:43.319
I got to go out. Got an extra key
so I don't wake you when I come back?

44:51.459 --> 44:53.867
This'll open the downstairs door, too.

44:55.548 --> 44:56.958
Watch your mouth.

44:57.091 --> 44:58.502
I'll say anything I want.

44:59.385 --> 45:02.006
Not in this house. Not here, you won't.

45:26.582 --> 45:27.577
Have a chair.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.702
I don't like your chair.

45:32.212 --> 45:34.253
You gave me nothing, Vic.

45:34.507 --> 45:38.719
You want to lock me up for manslaughter
'cause someone went out of my window...

45:39.804 --> 45:40.967
...go ahead.

45:41.389 --> 45:42.931
You got no deal.

45:44.935 --> 45:48.185
I have nothing else to give you, then.
That's straight.

45:49.023 --> 45:50.398
What do you got now?

45:50.483 --> 45:52.025
One question first.

45:52.109 --> 45:55.728
Anyone who could've identified those guys
with machine guns got wiped out!

45:55.822 --> 45:56.736
Yeah?

45:56.823 --> 46:00.607
Five of Ben Buford's people
and probably the guy that fingered you.

46:01.661 --> 46:04.200
Me? Are you sure it's me?

46:05.625 --> 46:08.542
I'd be sure if I knew if the guys
were black or white.

46:08.836 --> 46:10.793
I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.337
But Bumpy could probably tell you that
for sure.

46:13.425 --> 46:15.050
Just say what you got, man.

46:17.054 --> 46:18.714
A few things that may fit.

46:20.933 --> 46:24.599
Do you remember I told you that Bumpy
was doubling his crews up in Harlem?

46:24.687 --> 46:25.517
So?

46:25.605 --> 46:27.645
So, downtown we get some visitors.

46:28.274 --> 46:32.402
Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix,
a guy from Decatur, Illinois...

46:33.322 --> 46:36.773
...four guys from Philly.
Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.

46:37.618 --> 46:38.781
Special guys, huh?

46:38.869 --> 46:41.158
All suspected being guns for the Mafia.

46:41.330 --> 46:42.909
Just got into town.

46:43.250 --> 46:46.701
Most of them staying at a hotel
in the Village. Taking in the sights.

46:49.464 --> 46:50.460
Is that it?

46:50.549 --> 46:52.341
No, one thing more.

46:53.219 --> 46:56.552
A couple of dudes from Harlem
go across to Jersey.

46:57.306 --> 47:00.094
Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig.
They blew it.

47:00.434 --> 47:02.095
They killed the guy's runner.

47:02.187 --> 47:05.307
But the man says his runner
was in Florida on a fishing trip.

47:08.569 --> 47:10.894
- Looks like war coming.
- It's a bad thing.

47:11.823 --> 47:14.859
Mafia against Bumpy.
It's hood against hood, on the inside.

47:14.993 --> 47:17.199
On the outside, it's black against white.

47:19.205 --> 47:23.156
We could have tanks and troops
on Broadway if this thing breaks open.

47:24.670 --> 47:26.544
Yeah, you got a point.

47:27.256 --> 47:29.925
This is what some of
our visitors look like.

47:31.470 --> 47:33.130
Be a good time for it.

47:33.221 --> 47:34.419
What? War?

47:35.140 --> 47:36.848
Fishing down in Florida.

47:37.434 --> 47:40.055
It might help if I knew
what Bumpy hired you for.

47:40.270 --> 47:42.098
- Never said he did.
- He did.

47:43.608 --> 47:46.099
It's against my ethics to say yes or no.

47:46.861 --> 47:49.269
- He put you on the spot, Shaft.
- He did?

47:50.865 --> 47:52.859
You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.

47:54.161 --> 47:58.111
I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.

47:59.374 --> 48:00.834
That's a comfort.

48:11.388 --> 48:12.931
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.006
I waited up.

48:15.726 --> 48:18.015
- Sorry, I can't make it.
- Got problems?

48:19.605 --> 48:21.231
Yeah, I got a couple of them.

48:22.067 --> 48:25.767
I was born black and I was born poor.

48:27.948 --> 48:28.897
I love you.

48:30.785 --> 48:31.947
Yeah, I know.

48:32.995 --> 48:34.240
Take it easy.

48:49.012 --> 48:50.009
Get up.

48:50.932 --> 48:52.391
We've got a man to see.

49:10.996 --> 49:13.035
See who that is, will you?

49:23.926 --> 49:25.255
It's Shaft.

49:27.472 --> 49:28.801
Let him in.

49:40.820 --> 49:43.857
- I have an appointment with Bumpy.
- I know all about it.

49:46.242 --> 49:49.197
I've got to see if you're clean
before you can see the man.

49:50.456 --> 49:52.828
Better get yourself six more helpers then.

49:55.169 --> 49:56.628
That's how it's done.

49:57.046 --> 49:58.375
Who searches you?

49:58.632 --> 49:59.711
Nobody.

50:00.509 --> 50:02.964
Then get the same cat to search us.

50:06.765 --> 50:09.767
I've got to see if you got a gun on you
before you go in.

50:11.604 --> 50:14.060
Tell Bumpy we were here. Come on, Ben.

50:14.315 --> 50:16.058
You gonna let them walk now, Willy?

50:16.567 --> 50:18.312
Bumpy'll have your tail.

50:21.990 --> 50:24.197
Wait here, I'll call in to the man.

50:30.041 --> 50:31.784
What do you want, Willy?

50:32.335 --> 50:35.336
- Shaft's out here with some dude.
- Send them in.

50:35.713 --> 50:38.170
He won't let me see if they are clean.

50:38.592 --> 50:39.921
Let them in.

50:41.929 --> 50:43.423
Go on, you heard him.

50:46.809 --> 50:48.304
Listen, Snow White...

50:49.771 --> 50:51.894
...we're gonna tangle sooner or later.

50:54.151 --> 50:55.728
Did you hear what I said?

50:55.902 --> 50:58.311
Why don't you stop playing with yourself?

50:59.365 --> 51:01.073
You ain't gonna do shit!

51:31.108 --> 51:33.017
You're a cagey spook, Bumpy.

51:33.152 --> 51:35.643
You ride a tall horse, Mr. Shaft.

51:36.573 --> 51:41.199
This is Ben Buford. Your little caper
cost him five friends last night.

51:42.329 --> 51:45.781
- We'll take it out of your ass, pimp.
- You're pushing me a little far.

51:46.834 --> 51:48.827
I found out some things, Bumpy.

51:49.921 --> 51:53.918
You knew who grabbed your daughter,
and that it wasn't Ben or his people...

51:54.175 --> 51:56.548
...when you laid all that jive on me
in my office.

51:56.637 --> 52:00.136
I told you, there was no note.
I still don't know who has her.

52:00.474 --> 52:01.754
You're lying, man!

52:01.934 --> 52:04.888
Now, deal them up straight,
or don't deal them at all!

52:05.020 --> 52:07.594
You grabbed the dope hustle up here
from the Mafia.

52:08.024 --> 52:09.851
Made yourself some big bread.

52:09.984 --> 52:12.191
Now the Mafia wants to move in on you.

52:19.995 --> 52:20.909
So what?

52:21.038 --> 52:22.912
So, the Mafia grabbed your daughter.

52:23.457 --> 52:24.453
You knew it.

52:25.001 --> 52:26.661
You knew it when you hired me.

52:30.257 --> 52:31.003
Yeah.

52:31.883 --> 52:34.125
You tried to snatch one for a trade.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.927
But your flunky friends out there blew it.

52:37.515 --> 52:41.678
They burned some kid. Missed the man
we wanted to grab for a trade.

52:43.729 --> 52:45.604
Then you wanted to hustle old Shaft.

52:45.732 --> 52:49.066
I hired you for a job. I conned you,
but I never lied to you.

52:49.736 --> 52:51.147
My baby was grabbed.

52:51.738 --> 52:55.191
You'll get her back. You bought that deal.
You're gonna live with it.

52:57.912 --> 52:59.704
Not at these prices, baby.

53:06.839 --> 53:09.591
I told you what it costs, it costs.

53:13.429 --> 53:16.965
A lot of hyped-up black people give you
that money you're spending, pimp!

53:22.063 --> 53:25.647
Don't you try to bullshit me, boy.
We're all on the hustle.

53:26.819 --> 53:29.026
I sell broads and dope and numbers.

53:29.322 --> 53:32.073
You sell crap and blue sky.
It's all the same game.

53:35.871 --> 53:38.788
You knew the Mafia cats would come
after me, didn't you?

53:39.416 --> 53:41.243
But it doesn't shake me up.

53:41.710 --> 53:44.202
They made a good move
to take out my front man.

53:44.380 --> 53:46.669
They'll probably try again. I would.

53:47.926 --> 53:50.499
You been using me, Bumpy. Suckered me.

53:52.639 --> 53:55.309
That's okay. We stood face to face.

53:56.852 --> 53:59.972
But, I want to know why you wanted me
to hook up with Ben.

54:05.737 --> 54:08.738
'Cause you're gonna need an army
to get my baby back.

54:09.741 --> 54:10.737
Ben's got one.

54:11.034 --> 54:13.360
My people ain't worth a damn
outside of Harlem.

54:13.621 --> 54:16.492
If you think I'd risk
some of the brothers...

54:16.582 --> 54:19.951
...just 'cause your daughter's black,
you're wrong, man.

54:22.046 --> 54:23.245
We need money.

54:25.259 --> 54:27.500
I got a lot of brothers
and sisters in jail.

54:27.886 --> 54:28.835
Set a price.

54:34.102 --> 54:35.430
$10,000 a head.

54:38.106 --> 54:41.605
That's what the honky government
pays a cat in the Army for insurance.

54:42.653 --> 54:44.028
$10,000 a man.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.520
That's our price.

54:51.830 --> 54:52.826
All right.

54:57.711 --> 55:01.162
You telling me you're willing to lay out
that kind of bread for Marcy?

55:02.884 --> 55:04.294
Don't jive me, man.

55:05.303 --> 55:07.011
I can always get more money.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.920
I only got one baby.

55:10.933 --> 55:14.635
That means you already owe him $50,000
for the men he lost last night.

55:15.939 --> 55:16.971
All right.

55:19.401 --> 55:22.486
We can get a lot of brothers and sisters
out of jail with that.

55:22.572 --> 55:24.150
How many of his you'll need?

55:25.241 --> 55:27.649
Depends on whether
the Mafia will take a ransom.

55:28.286 --> 55:32.154
- They want Harlem, nothing less.
- It ain't yours to give. Not anymore.

55:32.291 --> 55:34.284
Mine or not, it's not gonna be theirs.

55:34.418 --> 55:37.834
All I gotta do is find out
where they've got her and bring her home.

55:38.464 --> 55:39.329
That's it.

55:39.798 --> 55:42.373
If he's worth $10,000, I'm worth $20,000.

55:44.346 --> 55:45.840
You got it, COD.

55:46.431 --> 55:48.388
Half now, half when I bring her home.

55:48.475 --> 55:49.305
All!

55:50.311 --> 55:51.224
Right now!

55:51.354 --> 55:54.058
Half, that's the best I'll do.

55:55.733 --> 55:57.441
You just been hustled, Bumpy.

55:58.152 --> 55:59.694
Deliver the money tonight.

56:00.781 --> 56:03.070
I'll have my boys drop it off.

56:03.700 --> 56:07.912
At these prices, you blow it, Shaft,
I'm not gonna like it.

56:08.121 --> 56:09.782
Not even a little bit.

56:10.041 --> 56:14.086
I thought the money didn't matter to you.
Just getting your baby back.

56:17.131 --> 56:18.923
Money always matters.

56:32.482 --> 56:34.391
This is where I get off, man.

56:35.151 --> 56:39.399
One thing we got to get straight.
If it comes to a fight, we do it my way.

56:40.491 --> 56:42.780
For that kind of bread,
the brothers'll play.

56:42.869 --> 56:45.027
As long as you remember
we owe them five.

56:45.121 --> 56:46.283
I said, my way!

56:48.876 --> 56:50.038
I'll call you.

57:23.205 --> 57:25.363
- Hey, man!
- Hey, Billy? Come here.

57:26.625 --> 57:28.120
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

57:28.252 --> 57:32.380
- Go up to my place and turn on the...
- Hey, no, man. I've already turned on.

57:32.715 --> 57:34.458
No, Billy, turn on the lights.

57:34.592 --> 57:35.457
Lights.

57:35.551 --> 57:37.508
- About two minutes, okay?
- Got it.

58:32.531 --> 58:34.239
How are we doing, love?

58:35.576 --> 58:37.653
That's nice. Don't make any trouble.

58:38.705 --> 58:40.947
- Johnny!
- What do you say, Rollie?

58:41.374 --> 58:43.165
Gorgeous coat!

58:45.545 --> 58:48.547
How about letting me
take over the bar for a while?

58:48.632 --> 58:51.206
There's nothing I wouldn't do for $20.

58:56.933 --> 58:58.178
Have funzies.

59:24.087 --> 59:25.202
You look ready.

59:25.798 --> 59:28.206
Yeah, okay. Scotch and water, both.

59:33.598 --> 59:35.009
On the house, gents.

59:40.689 --> 59:43.476
And since the house is buying,
I'll have one.

59:51.493 --> 59:53.948
To the big-hearted owner
of the No Name Bar.

59:54.037 --> 59:56.244
Whether he knows he's generous or not.

01:00:02.672 --> 01:00:03.786
That's all booze!

01:00:03.923 --> 01:00:04.920
Right on.

01:00:05.425 --> 01:00:08.130
All booze. One zillion percent.

01:00:20.525 --> 01:00:21.687
Hold on.

01:00:25.447 --> 01:00:26.562
Hold on.

01:00:31.036 --> 01:00:33.278
No, he ain't here. Right.

01:00:36.668 --> 01:00:38.328
Ho there, innkeeper?

01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:44.625
Two gin and tonics, and a Virgin Mary...

01:00:45.136 --> 01:00:46.381
...for moi.

01:00:47.054 --> 01:00:48.928
I'm thirsty. Parched.

01:00:49.724 --> 01:00:51.551
There's a girl over there...

01:00:51.684 --> 01:00:54.258
...with the dark hair
and the groovy boobs...

01:00:55.439 --> 01:00:58.559
You really turn her on,
if you're interested.

01:01:00.027 --> 01:01:01.272
I ain't dead.

01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:06.612
Her friend, Valerie, says she's hot
for my body. I told her I was gay.

01:01:06.701 --> 01:01:09.785
You know what she said?
She'd straighten me out.

01:01:10.914 --> 01:01:12.538
That's what she said.

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:17.325
It's not enough that I'm lovely,
she wants me to play character parts.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.625
The one with the titillating boobs
is named Linda.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.019
Man can't walk on one leg.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.446
Hate drinking alone.

01:02:17.237 --> 01:02:19.064
Vic, private line.

01:02:22.994 --> 01:02:24.108
Hey, sweet baby?

01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:25.822
This is your lover man.

01:02:26.914 --> 01:02:28.539
Who the hell is this?

01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:30.869
Two sweet guesses.

01:02:33.005 --> 01:02:34.250
That you, Shaft?

01:02:34.339 --> 01:02:38.752
You bet your lovely self it is.
And I'm ready. Can you dig it?

01:02:40.387 --> 01:02:41.384
Got troubles?

01:02:43.016 --> 01:02:45.174
- I got what you want.
- Where are you?

01:02:45.268 --> 01:02:47.011
No Name Bar in the Village.

01:02:47.312 --> 01:02:48.806
On Jane Street.

01:02:50.648 --> 01:02:53.935
- What do you want me to do?
- Haul your beautiful self down here.

01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:55.267
How many are there?

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.478
About two.

01:02:58.782 --> 01:03:01.274
I'll close up and we'll go over to my pad.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.789
You walk in that front door,
I'll close up right now.

01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:10.910
- I'll have a car there in a few seconds.
- That's what I want to hear.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.508
A lot of loose stuff around here?

01:03:24.978 --> 01:03:26.971
All a man can handle, deacon.

01:03:31.986 --> 01:03:33.611
What are you looking at?

01:03:38.201 --> 01:03:39.363
Get lost.

01:03:42.706 --> 01:03:44.165
Go do something.

01:03:46.001 --> 01:03:47.543
Where are my manners?

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:50.835
I didn't even introduce myself
to you gentlemen.

01:03:52.509 --> 01:03:54.964
My name is John Shaft.

01:03:55.887 --> 01:03:56.918
Freeze!

01:04:14.324 --> 01:04:15.783
Throw me a towel.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.496
There's two of them.
We're generous around here.

01:04:30.509 --> 01:04:31.884
It's not so bad.

01:04:37.016 --> 01:04:39.009
It's a nice pad you got here.

01:04:39.895 --> 01:04:42.895
I'm going upstairs to take a shower.
I'll be right back.

01:04:51.574 --> 01:04:53.365
I just couldn't wait.

01:05:21.065 --> 01:05:23.141
- What do you say, Vic?
- 'Morning.

01:05:24.318 --> 01:05:27.320
Both of them had guns,
licenses to carry them.

01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:30.604
"Jewelry couriers," the licenses say.

01:05:31.243 --> 01:05:32.737
Detroit people.

01:05:35.121 --> 01:05:37.364
- Will you turn them loose?
- I have no choice.

01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:40.202
They'll leave town.

01:05:40.294 --> 01:05:43.129
You'll have strangers looking for you,
not them.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.963
Can I have a private talk with them?

01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:50.095
What you'll do to poor Carmen now?
Give him cancer?

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.347
You busted his head, settle.

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:57.891
I want to find out his views
on urban renewal.

01:06:01.776 --> 01:06:02.891
All right.

01:06:28.848 --> 01:06:30.840
I'm speaking for Bumpy Jonas.

01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:33.471
He wants to be sure his daughter's okay.

01:06:33.894 --> 01:06:38.557
My word is all he'll take.
No phone calls and no letters from her.

01:06:39.443 --> 01:06:41.020
I've got to see her.

01:06:42.905 --> 01:06:44.529
Then maybe he'll deal.

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:48.691
Nothing I want to say in this rat hole.

01:06:49.287 --> 01:06:52.822
- People might be listening.
- That's a risk we'll have to take.

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:56.458
Now give me a number
so I can let you know where I'll be.

01:06:57.463 --> 01:07:00.001
I'll call you at 12:30 sharp!

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:03.801
And meet you at 12:45
somewhere in the Village.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.025
Hey, baby?

01:08:01.491 --> 01:08:03.484
- Come here.
- Party's over.

01:08:03.744 --> 01:08:05.203
You got to split.

01:08:06.247 --> 01:08:08.952
Some other time.
Same feeling, same place.

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:11.954
Right now I've got to take care
of some business.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.108
Put Ben on.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.319
He's asleep, who wants him?

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.904
Wake him up, it's John Shaft.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:44.662
You're really great in the sack, but...

01:08:45.916 --> 01:08:48.073
...you're pretty shitty afterwards.

01:08:52.005 --> 01:08:54.377
I'm trying to take care of some business.

01:08:56.636 --> 01:08:57.667
Come on!

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.886
I need two good men. Are you ready?

01:09:01.974 --> 01:09:02.889
Yeah.

01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:04.720
They'd better be tough.

01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:08.930
Baby, please close the door.

01:09:11.026 --> 01:09:12.818
Close it yourself, Shitty.

01:09:16.532 --> 01:09:19.736
- Tell me where and when.
- At CafÃ© Reggio in the Village.

01:09:19.827 --> 01:09:21.618
- Know where it is?
- I'll find it.

01:09:21.871 --> 01:09:24.161
12:30. Five minutes late would be too late.

01:09:24.249 --> 01:09:26.076
I'll be there. 'Bye.

01:10:08.673 --> 01:10:10.333
It's Vic Androzzi.

01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:17.508
What the hell are you doing here?

01:10:22.147 --> 01:10:23.855
I got no time for chats.

01:10:36.037 --> 01:10:40.034
You had time for a chat with Carmen
and Patsy in my office this morning.

01:10:46.214 --> 01:10:48.540
You got me in one hell of a mess.

01:10:51.304 --> 01:10:54.091
- Did you have the room bugged?
- No, not me.

01:10:54.557 --> 01:10:57.013
Me? I could turn the other way.

01:10:57.936 --> 01:10:59.810
Not hear what I heard.

01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:04.977
It's that big-eared Captain I got
who was listening.

01:11:08.155 --> 01:11:10.908
He thinks he heard you discussing
a kidnapping.

01:11:13.119 --> 01:11:15.159
He thinks the Mafia's involved.

01:11:18.249 --> 01:11:20.373
And he knows Bumpy Jonas is involved.

01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.205
Tell him to ask Bumpy then.

01:11:22.964 --> 01:11:23.995
Yeah, I did.

01:11:24.757 --> 01:11:26.382
But he wants to ask you.

01:11:26.592 --> 01:11:28.384
Now. At the station.

01:11:30.514 --> 01:11:32.091
Lousy timing, right?

01:11:32.516 --> 01:11:33.927
Gonna take me in?

01:11:35.894 --> 01:11:37.175
I will if I find you.

01:11:39.065 --> 01:11:40.096
Are you home?

01:11:40.608 --> 01:11:41.771
Hell, no.

01:11:43.695 --> 01:11:45.189
That's too bad.

01:11:52.162 --> 01:11:53.657
Call me when you get home.

01:11:54.957 --> 01:11:55.703
I will.

01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:03.504
"Close it yourself, Shitty."

01:12:29.162 --> 01:12:31.949
This is Shaft. Now get this straight!

01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:36.617
I'll be at CafÃ© Reggio
on McDougall street at 12:45.

01:12:38.422 --> 01:12:40.664
- Got it?
- Reggio, 12:45.

01:12:40.758 --> 01:12:41.623
Right.

01:13:39.739 --> 01:13:40.735
Menu?

01:13:41.616 --> 01:13:42.612
Espresso.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:46.788
Don't you want a sandwich
or something with it?

01:13:47.748 --> 01:13:49.159
Just espresso.

01:14:08.688 --> 01:14:10.977
I hope you don't like lemon peel.

01:14:12.358 --> 01:14:13.556
Let it go.

01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:17.233
I think you like it. I'll go get you some.

01:14:18.449 --> 01:14:20.572
I always forget the lemon peel.

01:14:53.278 --> 01:14:55.521
I'm looking for a nigger named John Shaft.

01:14:57.909 --> 01:14:59.783
You just found him, wop!

01:15:02.455 --> 01:15:03.534
Sit down.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.413
I have to take you to visit a lady.
Come on.

01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:11.456
I haven't finished my espresso.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.467
Why don't you have some?

01:15:16.972 --> 01:15:19.889
Maybe they'll put a little garlic in it,
if you're nice.

01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:26.899
No, thanks. But you go ahead.

01:15:30.361 --> 01:15:33.362
We've even got time for you
to have your soul food.

01:15:37.202 --> 01:15:38.365
Espresso?

01:15:39.663 --> 01:15:40.991
No, thanks.

01:15:44.377 --> 01:15:45.540
Keep it.

01:15:46.462 --> 01:15:47.838
Thanks, baby.

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:02.766
Let's go.

01:17:40.045 --> 01:17:41.209
Come on.

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:15.239
After you, man.

01:18:58.507 --> 01:18:59.753
You stay here.

01:18:59.842 --> 01:19:04.255
You get around the back, keep an eye
on the alley door. Stay out of sight.

01:19:04.597 --> 01:19:06.341
What if they come out our way?

01:19:06.432 --> 01:19:10.098
You follow them. Remmy,
you come back for me. Now move it!

01:19:24.369 --> 01:19:26.575
No noise. Now, answer me straight.

01:19:28.249 --> 01:19:29.791
No lies and no con.

01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:33.041
How many men you got in there with her?

01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.119
Two.

01:19:35.798 --> 01:19:36.794
Okay.

01:19:37.049 --> 01:19:41.463
When I tell you, you open that door like
this gun was about to blow your head off.

01:19:42.806 --> 01:19:44.882
No signal or you're gone. Got it?

01:19:46.059 --> 01:19:47.008
Yeah.

01:19:50.565 --> 01:19:51.181
Gin!

01:19:51.274 --> 01:19:52.388
Open it.

01:20:00.409 --> 01:20:02.200
Turn her loose or he goes.

01:20:04.246 --> 01:20:06.654
- Tell them to turn her loose.
- He won't.

01:20:08.043 --> 01:20:10.201
He won't shoot, Marcy, come here.

01:20:10.879 --> 01:20:13.037
There's nothing you can do, Shaft.

01:20:13.423 --> 01:20:16.839
Except go back to Harlem
and tell Bumpy his little girl is fine.

01:20:16.968 --> 01:20:19.923
- When I leave, she leaves with me.
- No way, Shaft.

01:20:20.139 --> 01:20:22.844
She's our ace. You never give up your ace.

01:20:23.309 --> 01:20:24.803
Maybe you're right.

01:20:25.144 --> 01:20:28.181
I should take you uptown
and turn you over to Bumpy.

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.860
Change your mind, you can walk right now.

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:36.024
You try to take the girl or me along,
you're dead.

01:20:36.323 --> 01:20:39.408
You trying to tell me they'd blow you away
to get me?

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:40.947
That's right.

01:20:46.543 --> 01:20:50.375
I halfway believe you. But, you're my ace,
so I got to call you.

01:21:04.145 --> 01:21:07.432
The only thing that's keeping you alive
right now is...

01:21:07.566 --> 01:21:10.852
...you got to be fit enough
to go tell that black punk in Harlem...

01:21:10.945 --> 01:21:14.444
...that he's got 24 hours to deal
or he's got a dead daughter!

01:21:14.532 --> 01:21:15.646
And a war!

01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:17.357
You hear me?

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.158
Come on, let's go!

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.329
Let's go!

01:21:31.718 --> 01:21:32.963
Back door.

01:22:09.217 --> 01:22:10.332
Come on.

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:14.461
Come on!

01:22:25.069 --> 01:22:26.777
You all right? Come on.

01:22:27.529 --> 01:22:28.561
Come on.

01:22:28.655 --> 01:22:30.066
You all right?

01:22:32.201 --> 01:22:33.825
Get me up out of here.

01:22:34.913 --> 01:22:37.783
The place'll be stinking with cops
in a minute.

01:22:40.168 --> 01:22:42.873
Grab those guns. Let's get out of here.

01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:55.721
- Ellie! Ellie, open up!
- Yes!

01:22:58.772 --> 01:23:00.480
My God! What happened?

01:23:01.358 --> 01:23:02.638
He's been shot.

01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:07.608
Put him on the couch.

01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:11.279
Didn't want to tell you on the phone.

01:23:23.258 --> 01:23:24.918
Ellie, call Sam.

01:23:25.552 --> 01:23:28.469
- You need a real doctor, baby.
- I said, call Sam.

01:23:42.988 --> 01:23:43.937
Easy.

01:23:52.832 --> 01:23:53.863
Blade.

01:23:55.168 --> 01:23:56.626
Get on the phone.

01:23:57.295 --> 01:24:00.628
We gonna need some more brothers.
With guns this time.

01:24:05.763 --> 01:24:08.514
Bumpy'll handle the transportation.

01:24:32.751 --> 01:24:34.411
Had to bring you to, Johnny.

01:24:34.503 --> 01:24:37.788
Can't fix anything else,
till you tell me where you hurt.

01:24:39.049 --> 01:24:40.543
Wall to wall, Sam.

01:24:42.887 --> 01:24:44.761
Ellie, give me that phone.

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.014
- Get those boys?
- Got eight.

01:24:50.937 --> 01:24:52.218
Know where they took her?

01:24:52.314 --> 01:24:55.813
One of the brothers tailed them.
He's watching the place now.

01:24:56.151 --> 01:24:57.895
What about the back exit?

01:24:58.237 --> 01:25:00.644
Everything's cool, baby. Don't worry.

01:25:01.157 --> 01:25:02.901
Did you run into a train?

01:25:04.119 --> 01:25:07.618
Tight as you can get it.
I got to get up soon as you're done.

01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.077
Damn, those were some tough white boys.

01:25:15.715 --> 01:25:18.087
You're gonna have one hell of a time.

01:25:18.217 --> 01:25:20.543
Got a bad sprain on that right wrist.

01:25:20.721 --> 01:25:21.634
Tape it.

01:25:21.722 --> 01:25:25.470
I did, damn it. What do you think I am,
an amateur?

01:25:26.601 --> 01:25:29.472
Too good of a job, Sam.
I didn't even feel it.

01:25:46.957 --> 01:25:48.155
Wrong number.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:51.287
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.
I saw Marcy.

01:25:51.838 --> 01:25:53.249
Is she all right?

01:25:54.132 --> 01:25:55.591
Scared to death, but okay.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.086
I need three cabs,
on the corner of Ninth and Washington.

01:26:00.222 --> 01:26:02.678
- To pick up some of Ben's people.
- How soon?

01:26:02.767 --> 01:26:04.225
Now, man, now!

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:23.027
Okay, you two! Outside! Move, move!

01:26:24.165 --> 01:26:25.244
Let's go!

01:26:27.877 --> 01:26:29.206
Tie them up!

01:26:31.215 --> 01:26:33.421
All right, where are the uniforms?

01:26:53.406 --> 01:26:56.027
- Who's that?
- The night janitor. He's okay.

01:26:56.909 --> 01:26:59.662
Use him to find out
which room they got her in.

01:27:01.456 --> 01:27:03.864
- Getting it together?
- Yeah, right on.

01:27:15.304 --> 01:27:16.467
Beautiful.

01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:26.429
Just beautiful.

01:27:28.319 --> 01:27:30.063
Jerry, how are you doing, baby?

01:27:34.367 --> 01:27:35.482
Hey, boy?

01:27:40.374 --> 01:27:42.414
Send up two coffees and a Coke.

01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:45.080
Glass or a straw?

01:27:46.422 --> 01:27:47.668
For the Coke.

01:27:48.008 --> 01:27:49.383
Make it a straw.

01:27:53.638 --> 01:27:54.634
Straw?

01:27:55.265 --> 01:27:56.844
You heard me, straw.

01:27:58.936 --> 01:28:00.395
Right.

01:28:03.066 --> 01:28:04.690
You're a shrewd cat, Shaft.

01:28:04.776 --> 01:28:07.777
You and your boys blow it
and I'll be one dead cat!

01:28:08.405 --> 01:28:10.979
You all know the plan. No mistakes.

01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:14.031
Let's go.

01:28:48.533 --> 01:28:51.569
There you are, sir.
Two coffees, a Coke and a straw.

01:28:51.828 --> 01:28:53.785
- Want me to take it in?
- Whoa.

01:28:57.084 --> 01:28:58.080
Right.

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:06.921
Hey, thank you!

01:29:08.513 --> 01:29:10.304
- I'll be seeing you.
- Okay.

01:30:17.381 --> 01:30:18.460
Shut up!

01:30:22.636 --> 01:30:24.962
- What do you guys want?
- Your coat.

01:30:54.463 --> 01:30:55.874
Rope and harness.

01:31:13.317 --> 01:31:14.562
Go ahead down.

01:31:47.855 --> 01:31:49.480
Did you hear anything?

01:33:17.704 --> 01:33:19.911
This damn thing won't burn hot enough.

01:33:19.999 --> 01:33:22.668
You got something else
in there that'll burn?

01:33:39.437 --> 01:33:40.682
It's gin, man.

01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:47.068
What else you got?

01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:52.321
Gasoline.

01:34:03.588 --> 01:34:04.619
Come on!

01:34:36.707 --> 01:34:38.251
Give me a cigarette.

01:34:49.389 --> 01:34:51.298
- You know what to do?
- Yeah.

01:37:24.810 --> 01:37:26.637
Let's get out of here!

01:37:53.299 --> 01:37:54.331
Come on!

01:37:55.886 --> 01:37:56.965
Let's go!

01:38:49.027 --> 01:38:50.308
Androzzi, here.

01:38:51.029 --> 01:38:54.234
- Vic, your case just busted wide open.
- So close it for me.

01:38:54.325 --> 01:38:56.484
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.

01:38:56.911 --> 01:39:00.031
"You'll have to close
it yourself, Shitty! "
