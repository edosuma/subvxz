00:10.510 --> 00:13.513
Well, Freddy,
the fridge is definitely broken.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.266
It feels like the wheels are really coming
off this place.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.351
I didn't know
apartment building had wheel?

00:20.145 --> 00:22.731
It's an expression.
It means things are going bad.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.025
- Like my whole life.
- Aw.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.610
Really, Jin? What is going on?

00:28.236 --> 00:29.779
Well--

00:31.239 --> 00:33.491
My parents' marriage is crumbling,
and I completely failed to help

00:33.491 --> 00:35.994
my friend Wei-Chen
in his quest to find the Fourth Scroll.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.288
Why? What happened?

00:40.749 --> 00:41.875
Guess I was scared.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.755
He thought I was gonna be
his guide and lead him to his destiny,

00:46.755 --> 00:48.548
but I wasn't, and I didn't.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.801
Sound like you need to
put your wheel back on.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.513
Jin, come have dinner.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.849
Mom? Dad?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.310
Hey, Jin, any chance
you can fix the washing machine?

01:00.310 --> 01:02.062
I'm down to my last two socks.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.398
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.483
Jin.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.984
Oh, my God!

01:07.984 --> 01:09.652
Oh, my Goddess.

01:11.071 --> 01:15.325
I must speak to you about an urgent matter
of life and death.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.409
What's going on?

01:17.160 --> 01:20.497
Today is <i>Qiufen</i>, the autumn equinox.

01:20.497 --> 01:24.918
The day when Heaven
and Earth are perfectly in balance,

01:24.918 --> 01:28.338
and the gate between them opens
for just... [whispers] ...a moment.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.217
Which mean Bull Demon can finally complete
his uprising.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.637
And you must stop him
or everyone will perish.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.263
I need to stop him?

01:37.263 --> 01:41.017
Remember, power comes from within.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.019
It flows from the core.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.189
Sorry,
but I think you've got the wrong guy.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.361
Jin, a hero doesn't always have to
have superpowers.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.866
A hero is someone who goes on a journey,
shows courage, helps others.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.369
And fixes the washing machine.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.540
Jin, it's dinnertime.

02:04.791 --> 02:09.796
Remember, tonight's soccer game carries
epic consequences.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.506
Ooh.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.758
Found it.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.555
I think this is what's been causing
all the problems.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.560
Everything is more connected
than you think.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.928
Yo, Jin!

02:59.846 --> 03:02.140
- Thanks for ghosting us on game day.
- What?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.474
We've been texting you, man.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.269
You're supposed to wear our jersey.
Coach wants us locked in.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.730
Hey, man.
Tonight's game has epic consequences.

03:09.939 --> 03:10.940
What did you just say?

03:11.691 --> 03:12.692
It's the qualifier.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.029
Right. Um...
...have any of you guys seen Wei-Chen?

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
- No.
- No.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.407
Okay.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.454
- Locked in?
- What?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.179
Hey.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.306
Hey.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.269
All right. We all know
what today is, right?

03:48.937 --> 03:52.482
The autumn equinox!

03:53.107 --> 03:55.735
Which, of course,
means gravitational balance.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.363
But did you know
that today is the one day of the year

04:00.365 --> 04:03.159
that you can balance an egg perfectly
on its end?

04:05.411 --> 04:08.039
Hey, cosplayers,
four more hours till showtime.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.500
Thomas, did you put glitter
on this battle axe?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.460
- Yeah.
- Anuj, we gotta talk.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.880
Not a great time. We're working on
tonight's performance for <i>Kugo Ren Saga</i>.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.052
- You're doing <i>Kugo Ren</i>?
- Pick up the pace.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.097
- What's up?
- Okay, um...

04:24.931 --> 04:26.724
How do I put this? Uh.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.852
The characters from <i>Kugo Ren</i> are real.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.188
Okay. Yeah.

04:32.855 --> 04:33.940
Anuj...

04:33.940 --> 04:37.068
What? I was just debating whether
I should take you to the doctor or not.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.946
Listen, I can't explain it, but there's
a whole nother world out there.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.532
And why are you telling me this?

04:43.199 --> 04:46.452
I had a dream last night, and everything
in it is weirdly coming true.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.122
Like, the shirt.
I knew you were gonna wear that today.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.498
Dude, I wear this shirt a lot.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.710
Okay, well, in my dream,
you were also wearing mismatching socks.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.336
Blue on the right, yellow on the left?

04:55.878 --> 04:58.715
Okay. That's pretty weird.

04:58.715 --> 05:02.135
If my dream is a warning,
and I think it is,

05:02.135 --> 05:05.096
it means something bad
is going to happen today. Like really bad.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.682
I don't know what,
but I know that we have to find Wei-Chen

05:07.682 --> 05:09.058
and figure out how to stop it.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.856
Okay, yeah. Honestly,
I-I-I don't know what to believe,

05:14.856 --> 05:19.902
but I've never seen you this passionate
about anything, so I'm in.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.447
Yeah.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.150
What's going on?

05:59.942 --> 06:01.194
I left work early.

06:02.487 --> 06:06.115
I told my boss I needed the day to do
something important with my wife.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.618
Do what?

06:09.786 --> 06:11.412
We're going to get your pendant back.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.044
Wei-Chen?

06:20.838 --> 06:21.881
Wei-Chen.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.093
You all right?

06:33.768 --> 06:34.769
He's gone.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.814
No.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.401
Listen.
Wei-Chen, we're gonna get your dad back.

06:41.943 --> 06:42.944
No, Jin.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.155
I had a stupid dream.

06:46.155 --> 06:49.659
I thought I could keep the staff away
from Bull Demon,

06:50.493 --> 06:53.830
but I just got my father stabbed
by a magic mirror.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.374
So sorry, Wei-Chen.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.627
I had a dream too.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.796
Guanyin came to see me.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.340
She said the Bull Demon is here,

07:04.340 --> 07:07.218
and he's going to carry out his uprising
unless I can stop it.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.555
What is he planning to do?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.849
I have no idea.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.726
<i>Phantom Fury 17.</i>

07:16.561 --> 07:17.562
What?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.605
In <i>Phantom Fury 17</i>,

07:19.605 --> 07:22.900
the villain stabs Monkey Lord with
the magic mirror and steals his staff.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.945
You saw that in a comic?

07:25.945 --> 07:29.490
Yeah. Your dad is Sun Wukong, right?
Like, the Monkey King?

07:29.490 --> 07:30.700
You know him?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.244
Yeah, dude, everybody knows him.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.122
<i>Kugo Ren</i> isn't the only comic book
based on him.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.041
<i>Starzinger</i>, <i>Dragon Ball</i>,
<i>Mega Man</i>, <i>Saiyuki</i>, <i>Enma</i>...

07:39.041 --> 07:40.877
There's, like, eight different comic books

07:40.877 --> 07:43.171
where the villain steals
the Monkey King's magic staff

07:43.171 --> 07:45.131
to sort out some sort of evil plan.

07:45.131 --> 07:49.886
Uh, <i>Sango Warriors</i>, <i>Darkest Intention</i>,
and definitely <i>Phantom Fury 17</i>.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.640
So, you think Bull Demon's plan is hidden
in manga?

07:55.224 --> 07:58.311
Maybe everything is more connected
than we think.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.484
We need to see those comics.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.157
Hello.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.368
We were here a few days ago
and lost a jewelry.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.162
Just wondering if anyone found it.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.747
Sorry, it's not here.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.208
Are you sure?
Uh, maybe someone in the back found it.

08:20.791 --> 08:21.876
I told you, it's not here.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.545
It's a pendant. It's round.
It has orange color--

08:24.545 --> 08:26.088
Look. We're very busy.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.966
If you not eating here, please leave.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.594
Hey. That is my wife.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.970
Have a little respect.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.889
Why? You didn't.

08:34.889 --> 08:38.226
The other night.
Screaming at each other like drunk idiots.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.269
I remember you two.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.482
I want to talk to your manager, Mr. Gong.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.485
Gong's not the manager. He's the busboy.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.196
He never show up today, so he's fired.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.490
I know that because I'm the manager.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.371
Well then, I am taking this--

08:58.955 --> 09:01.123
Please do. They're two years old.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.001
Come on. Let's go.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.423
- Now you have bad luck!
- Hey, don't do that.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.675
You're rude!

09:11.384 --> 09:12.593
I know it's here.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.095
Let's just go home.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.889
Let's see what's back here.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.307
Let's go!

09:18.307 --> 09:19.392
Simon.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.143
Come on! Come on!

09:32.154 --> 09:33.781
Where are we?

09:34.448 --> 09:37.201
Smells like burnt chemicals.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.956
Kinda reminds me of our first apartment.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.249
Same smell.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.294
I miss that place sometimes.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.004
Me too.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.924
Remember how we'd get dressed up

09:51.924 --> 09:54.051
and argue over which restaurant to go to?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.387
You always wanted beef noodles.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.224
You wanted lobster.
And cheesecake.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.393
But we couldn't afford any of it,

10:02.393 --> 10:05.062
so I'd put on my favorite dress
just to cook rice.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.774
I loved you in that dress.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.405
Look!

10:16.532 --> 10:17.992
Oh, my God.

10:33.341 --> 10:37.094
Okay, so this Bull Demon guy pops up
in different forms all over these comics.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.971
This one shows him having brothers.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.473
That's true. He has seven.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.267
In this one,
he can shape-shift like your dad.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.062
He can but just a little. Not a master.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.482
Here, he's fighting a drunk guy
with a magic-bead necklace.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.651
Ji Gong just gave that to me. Yesterday.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.862
This one shows him having chain saws
for arms.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.741
- No.
- Ah, damn, I was hoping that one was real.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.411
But why is he still here
if the uprising is in Heaven?

11:02.995 --> 11:06.207
Uh, in my dream,
Guanyin said something about the equinox

11:06.207 --> 11:08.626
and the gate between Earth
and Heaven opening.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.129
Maybe he's trying to pull a Harvey Elder.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.174
-<i>The Fantastic Four</i>?
- Mole Man.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.802
- What?
-<i>Fantastic Four</i>.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.262
There's this villain,
Harvey Elder, the Mole Man.

11:20.262 --> 11:23.474
He destroys all these nuclear power plants
by attacking them from below.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.227
I mean, it is called an uprising.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.521
Ooh, check this one out:

11:28.521 --> 11:32.149
"In <i>Kugo Ren Saga 57</i>, the Bull Demon
plants the staff into a field

11:32.149 --> 11:35.903
and extends it down to the earth's core,
harnessing the power of the whole world."

11:35.903 --> 11:39.657
Guanyin said that power comes from within.
"It flows from the core."

11:40.491 --> 11:42.993
He's going to use your world
to destroy mine.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.496
We gotta get to the soccer game.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.166
It can't be that hard to find a guy
wearing a cheesy leather jacket

11:49.166 --> 11:50.543
and a stupid nose ring.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.961
Unless he shape-shifted.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.879
Right. Unless he shape-shifted.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.132
Let's go.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.469
Water. I need water.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.555
Here.

12:07.935 --> 12:08.936
What is this?

12:08.936 --> 12:12.064
Just hot water and some healthy stuff.

12:13.065 --> 12:17.528
Uh, it's a wildflower herbal powder.
My wife owns the business.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.490
I need to go. I need to--

12:21.490 --> 12:24.201
- Take it easy. Take it--
- You don't understand--

12:24.201 --> 12:25.327
Take it easy.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.788
Drink more.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.917
Do you want us to call for help?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.044
No. Please don't.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.422
Were you in a fight?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.966
My son...

12:41.010 --> 12:43.971
He ran away from home.
Got into some trouble.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.098
I had to get involved.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.976
You mean, criminals?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.354
Something like that.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.776
It must be terrible to find your son
in a place like this.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.612
Yes.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.364
But it was my fault.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.200
What happened?

13:06.327 --> 13:09.246
I tried to keep him
from making the same mistakes I made.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.916
But I pushed him away.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.131
Children are like a mirror.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.218
Sometimes it's hard to look.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.644
Well, I hope you feel better.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.648
I do, actually.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.149
Please keep this.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.527
- It gives you strength and energy.
- Mmm.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.531
Have more powder too.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.574
Huh?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.660
- Take care.
- Mmm.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.828
Thank you.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.436
- Heartbreaking...
- Mmm.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.399
- ...to see someone like that...
- Mmm.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.651
He has nothing.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.071
No home, no money, he's probably divorced...

14:24.864 --> 14:28.659
and his son is on drugs.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.873
- He was right though.
- Mmm.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.502
- Children are a mirror.
- Mmm.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.506
And when I look at our son...

14:42.506 --> 14:44.466
I know we'll be okay.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.727
We should go to his game.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.525
Well, hello, world!

15:01.525 --> 15:05.362
Oh! I hope you're excited
about the soccer!

15:05.362 --> 15:07.489
Go Cranes! Whoo-hoo!

15:08.032 --> 15:11.869
But before that,
we have our Fall Club Showcase.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.247
And first up is Climate Club

15:15.247 --> 15:19.251
with a very cool message
about single-use plasticware.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.128
Whoo!

15:21.128 --> 15:23.631
Our planet is about to be destroyed,

15:24.214 --> 15:26.383
and only you can save it.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.928
Okay, so, we find the Bull Demon,

15:28.928 --> 15:31.513
we get that staff before he can use it
to blow up Heaven.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.850
Yeah, but if he can shape-shift,
he could literally be anyone.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.519
He's not very good at it though.
Not like my father.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.481
Okay, so,
we just look for someone acting weird?

15:40.981 --> 15:41.982
Yeah, I guess.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.776
Hey, guys.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.362
Hi, friends. Everything's normal.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.033
Oh, uh, Jin. Congrats on starting
in the game tonight,

15:51.033 --> 15:53.494
but be careful out there.
It's gonna be dangerous.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.329
What? Why?

15:55.913 --> 15:58.374
Uh, you know. 'Cause revenge.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.753
We're playing Osito Valley, our rivals.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.214
- Oh, yeah, totally. Sports.
- Right, right.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.007
Anyway, Amelia wanted to say something.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.759
- Ruby?
- What? You do.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.929
Hey, Jin, could I talk to you real quick?

16:12.638 --> 16:13.639
Uh.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.933
- Right now?
- Yeah, it'll just take a second.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.478
Yes, he can, because everything is normal.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.398
Right. Yeah, okay, I'll see you guys
in a bit. [whispers] You keep looking.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.900
<i>And now it's time for our next club...</i>

16:24.900 --> 16:27.611
I'm sorry, there's just a lot
of stuff going on right now and--

16:27.611 --> 16:29.530
So, you remember
at the beginning of the year

16:29.530 --> 16:32.658
when you asked me to hang out,
and I said we could be buds?

16:33.409 --> 16:34.410
Oh...

16:34.910 --> 16:38.163
No, no. Listen, I-I told you already,
like, I'm totally fine.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.125
Well, I-- I'm not.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.211
Oh.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.338
I feel like
we've hung out a lot since then,

16:46.338 --> 16:48.632
and you know,
gotten to know each other better...

16:48.632 --> 16:51.677
...and we were lab partners,
and you came to my house.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.847
And I don't know everything that's going
on with your family,

16:54.847 --> 16:58.892
but I just feel like lately,
you've kind of been dodging me.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.186
- No, no. Um--
- I just--

17:01.186 --> 17:03.731
I keep trying to find the right words to, like...

17:04.982 --> 17:07.484
draw you out
and to get to the real you, and I--

17:07.484 --> 17:08.736
My God, that's it.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.572
What?

17:11.572 --> 17:14.074
We have to draw him out.
That's what we have to do.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.202
See, I feel like
you're doing it right now.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.787
Y-You get distracted or something.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.041
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
you're kind of the only person

17:22.041 --> 17:23.625
that I can really be myself around,

17:23.625 --> 17:26.086
and I wanna hang out with you more.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.256
Not as buds.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.054
Jin.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.391
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's a soccer game tonight.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.351
Oh...

17:41.351 --> 17:42.770
Yeah, sorry, I'll be right there.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.275
I should go.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.653
Yeah. Okay.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.635
We'll talk later.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.346
Yeah.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.821
It's starting.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.536
Oh, God.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.624
There's something maybe
I should have told you earlier.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.753
My father's staff is very powerful.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.005
So if Niu Mowang succeeds

18:53.257 --> 18:55.467
everyone here will probably die.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.098
Yeah, dude, you definitely
should have told us that earlier.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.933
Hey, Ruby! Everything's normal.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.601
- Hey.
- Okay.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.397
Guys. Did you find anything?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.816
Where have ya been, dude?
The portal to Heaven's opening.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.111
And if we don't stop Bull Demon,
everyone here's gonna get annihilated.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.575
Oh, no...

19:21.410 --> 19:23.287
Where's the Cosplay Club getting ready?

19:23.787 --> 19:26.415
- Did you hear anything I just said?
- Yeah.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.084
I think I know how to find him.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.003
Come on!

19:35.757 --> 19:37.217
Hey, everyone, listen up.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.470
Change of plans.
Uh, Lizzie, I'm gonna need that dress.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.639
<i>And finally,</i>

19:42.639 --> 19:45.684
put your hands together
for our last presentation.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.062
They're really gonna blow your mind.

19:49.062 --> 19:53.192
The one, the only, Cosplay Club!

20:00.532 --> 20:04.953
<i>The Celestial Realm has been
defended by Kugo Ren for millennia.</i>

20:04.953 --> 20:09.208
<i>However, his nemesis Mo Akuna,
the Bull Demon,</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:12.294
<i>has mounted an uprising
and stolen the Sacred Staff.</i>

20:12.961 --> 20:17.299
<i>On the eve of his attack,
the Goddess of Mercy confronts him.</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:28.560
This is gonna be hilarious.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.147
Bull Demon!

20:33.315 --> 20:35.984
Your craven attempt at power is futile!

20:36.485 --> 20:39.988
Surrender your uprising now!

20:41.281 --> 20:43.617
Uh... [stammers] ...it's too late!

20:44.618 --> 20:47.162
No one can stop my plan of destruction.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.582
Once I plant this staff in the ground,
everyone here will die!

20:50.582 --> 20:52.251
I love it.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.170
If you insist on this silly act
of vengeance,

20:55.170 --> 20:57.297
the forces of Heaven and Earth...

20:57.714 --> 20:59.341
I thought he was playing soccer.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.094
- This is your last warning.
- Maybe this is part of it?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.845
I'd like to see you try!

21:03.845 --> 21:06.014
- Stop! Look!
- No!

21:06.014 --> 21:07.432
What do you see? Tell me!

21:07.432 --> 21:08.976
No!

21:09.643 --> 21:10.686
I see...

21:11.478 --> 21:12.604
I see...

21:13.689 --> 21:15.315
I see a supervillain.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.652
I see a supervillain
who's fueled by revenge,

21:18.652 --> 21:21.280
and he's gonna stop at nothing
to control the world,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.156
even if it means he's gonna destroy it.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.617
Boo!

21:25.617 --> 21:26.702
And I see...

21:28.078 --> 21:29.413
I see, um...

21:30.914 --> 21:34.334
I see a sad, lonely little bull, actually.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.755
I see someone who's obsessed
with what other people think about him.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.301
Honestly, I see a guy
who doesn't really like himself that much.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.054
I see someone who doesn't want to
show the world who he is

21:46.054 --> 21:50.517
because he's afraid that
if other people saw who he really was,

21:50.517 --> 21:52.352
they'd just laugh at him.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.730
Or worse, they just wouldn't care.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.940
And that makes him sad.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.110
And, sometimes,

22:00.986 --> 22:03.405
it makes him hurt people
that he really cares about.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.075
And the worst part is,
he doesn't know why he feels that way.

22:07.868 --> 22:08.994
He just does.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.872
But maybe it's not too late.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.291
Maybe he could just drop the act.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.210
Maybe he could just go
back to Heaven right now

22:17.794 --> 22:20.297
and make things right
before anyone else gets hurt.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.555
Maybe?

22:35.145 --> 22:38.398
Yeah, or, uh, maybe not, honestly,
because at the end of the day,

22:38.398 --> 22:43.320
I'm still just, like, a weak, dumb, whiny,
little cow baby, and everyone knows it.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.863
Right? Guys, I have seven brothers,

22:44.863 --> 22:48.658
and every single one of them is cooler,
smarter, and better-looking than I am.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.119
I try to cover up all these,
like, unresolved insecurities

22:51.119 --> 22:54.498
with this stupid-looking leather jacket
and this dumb nose ring from the 1990s.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.626
And I have this goatee that looks like
someone chopped the butt off a goat

22:57.626 --> 22:58.710
and stuck it to my neck.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.884
But nobody's buying it.

23:05.884 --> 23:10.430
'Cause at the end of the day,
everybody can tell how hard I'm trying.

23:10.430 --> 23:14.518
I'm just so puffed up, it looks like
I'm just, like, full of, like, cow farts

23:14.518 --> 23:17.270
and, like, if you pull my nose ring,
it all comes out.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.329
Larkins!

23:39.501 --> 23:41.211
That was sick.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.640
- Come on, Wei-Chen!
- Get him!

23:59.855 --> 24:01.314
Go, Wei-Chen!

24:13.994 --> 24:15.203
Watch out!

24:28.216 --> 24:29.259
It's opening!

24:44.774 --> 24:46.985
- Whoa, you kids okay?
- Shh.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.612
Wei-Chen!

25:17.307 --> 25:19.184
What the hell are these kids doing?

25:19.184 --> 25:23.647
Oh, my God! That was so cool.
So much better than last year.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.590
Yo, are they flying?

25:50.590 --> 25:51.883
I mean, I guess.

26:05.814 --> 26:06.856
We gotta stop it!

26:06.856 --> 26:09.109
- What can we do?
- Come on!

26:19.661 --> 26:21.204
How are they doing that?

26:21.705 --> 26:24.499
Anuj's parents are loaded.

27:00.952 --> 27:01.953
Ready!

27:02.454 --> 27:04.581
One, two, throw!

27:08.668 --> 27:10.170
Well, that didn't work!

27:51.211 --> 27:53.588
I want you to see this!

28:02.097 --> 28:04.391
Hey. Hey. Hey, it's gonna blow!

28:21.116 --> 28:23.368
Jin. Come eat dinner.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.924
You have to be brave, Jin.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.429
What if I'm not though?

28:45.014 --> 28:46.599
Do you know who you are?

28:48.643 --> 28:51.104
You are worlds clashing into each other.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.191
You are all the pieces merging into one.

28:55.817 --> 28:59.362
You're everything we ever hoped for.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.658
None of it makes sense, Mom.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.536
And that's okay.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.999
I wish you knew how much strength
you have inside you.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.627
You just have to unlock it.

29:15.628 --> 29:16.796
I don't know how.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.425
Just be you, Jin.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.219
Just be you.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.733
Jin! Jin!

30:09.641 --> 30:12.143
Jin! Jin, Jin.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.103
Jin, wake up.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.898
Oh, Jin, you okay?

30:28.785 --> 30:29.786
Father!

30:31.246 --> 30:32.455
You're alive.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.582
You were right.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.377
You found the Fourth Scroll.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.133
You are the Fourth Scroll.

30:45.468 --> 30:46.761
He's the Fourth Scroll!

30:49.681 --> 30:52.225
He is the Fourth Scroll!

30:55.687 --> 30:59.440
Yes! He's the freakin' Fourth Scroll!

30:59.440 --> 31:02.151
Can we start the game now?

31:31.264 --> 31:33.057
Yeah! You're the man!

31:42.984 --> 31:45.361
Dude. That was insane.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.113
I know.

31:47.113 --> 31:51.075
I can't believe you kissed Amelia.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.497
- Call you in the morning.
- Yeah.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.960
You are the Fourth Scroll! Whoo-hoo!

32:07.216 --> 32:08.593
Wei-Chen! Uh...

32:10.136 --> 32:12.055
Where were you? You guys just disappeared.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.475
My father took Niu Mowang
to face the Jade Emperor.

32:16.184 --> 32:19.228
And I asked him if I could say goodbye.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.111
Well, your dream came true.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.905
You stopped the uprising.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.532
No. You did.

32:32.742 --> 32:33.993
You saved my home.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.121
I still don't know how I did that.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.248
Neither do I.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.752
But I'm gonna find out.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.590
Will I ever see you again?

32:49.175 --> 32:50.218
I hope so.

32:53.012 --> 32:54.180
You are my best friend.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.573
Bye, Jin.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.368
Bye, Wei-Chen.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.613
Mom?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.201
Dad?

34:13.009 --> 34:14.385
Hi, Jin.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.138
Who are you?

34:20.224 --> 34:24.103
You know, I have been wanting to ask you
the same thing.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.067
But I got my answer tonight.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.987
That's why you're coming with me.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.120
If you want to see your parents again.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.378
I'm sorry, can you say that
one more time slower?

34:49.378 --> 34:51.214
My Chinese isn't super good.
