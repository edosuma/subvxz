00:03.129 --> 00:07.269
Only two left. I'll cut you
a deal. They're collector's items.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.189
You won't be sorry.

00:13.929 --> 00:15.189
Turn them on and let them go.

00:16.329 --> 00:17.170
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

00:21.129 --> 00:23.550
- Here you go.
- Nice doing business with you.

00:24.129 --> 00:25.000
Wait, miss!

00:31.329 --> 00:32.409
Okay.

03:01.729 --> 03:05.659
Demons with one eye, demons with
12 eyes, some with double vision.

03:07.129 --> 03:08.599
No blind demons.

03:10.129 --> 03:14.550
- Perhaps Angel's found a new species.
- What? Helen Kellerus Homicidalus?

03:19.129 --> 03:22.150
- It's possible she's not a demon.
- You think?

03:22.729 --> 03:26.210
Maybe she's learned to hone
her senses around her disability.

03:26.930 --> 03:29.840
Angel said it was like
she anticipated his actions.

03:29.930 --> 03:32.180
A handy skill,
in a fight or on a date.

03:32.930 --> 03:36.020
Unusual to be certain,
but not necessarily demonic.

03:36.530 --> 03:40.639
Someone like that stands out in
a crowd. For an assassin, I mean.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.430
- Decidedly.
- Maybe even have a record.

03:44.930 --> 03:47.949
One assumes she's done
this sort of thing before.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.949
- Vanessa Brewer.
- What? You found her?

03:51.530 --> 03:53.599
It doesn't always have to be weird.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.560
Sometimes real human people
can be just awful.

03:57.530 --> 04:00.860
- First arrested in '93.
- She fled the scene of a homicide.

04:01.129 --> 04:03.300
No charges. Arrested again in '95.

04:04.129 --> 04:07.819
Charged with aggravated assault.
That one never went to trial.

04:08.330 --> 04:11.909
And finally arrested in '99
as a suspect in a double homicide...

04:12.530 --> 04:16.779
- ...for which she's now on trial.
- She was on bail when Angel met her.

04:17.930 --> 04:21.230
But that's not the real whammy.
Look who's defending her.

04:22.129 --> 04:26.699
We request the court's compassion
in this obviously mishandled affair.

04:27.529 --> 04:29.670
The D.A.'s attempt
to link Miss Brewer...

04:30.529 --> 04:33.089
...to this brutal crime
is almost laughable.

04:33.529 --> 04:36.480
To think that my client,
with her particular disability...

04:37.129 --> 04:39.550
...could physically
commit such a murder...

04:40.129 --> 04:41.879
...is beyond the realm of belief.

04:42.529 --> 04:43.399
Hey, hold it!

04:52.730 --> 04:56.139
She obviously doesn't see
the way we do, but she can see.

04:59.329 --> 05:01.399
In a sense. The eye's only capable...

05:02.329 --> 05:06.019
...of registering a small portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

05:06.529 --> 05:09.550
But if she were equipped
to see outside that range--

05:10.129 --> 05:13.079
She'd be Superman.
What's the diff in how she sees?

05:13.730 --> 05:17.029
She'll look at cell bars.
Why are we still talking about this?

05:17.329 --> 05:20.350
Because Wolfram and Hart's
representing her pro bono...

05:21.529 --> 05:24.410
...which means she's probably
still working for them.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.579
I can't believe
you got her off on all charges.

05:41.410 --> 05:43.480
Not since Ostrosky vs. California...

05:43.810 --> 05:46.439
...have I seen such
devious legal maneuvering.

05:47.410 --> 05:50.360
And now the big brass
are smiling upon you.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.600
You're the man of the hour.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.360
Is there something you want?

05:58.209 --> 06:02.779
Is it me, or is there something
kind of hot about her?

06:05.410 --> 06:09.240
I'm just saying, I wouldn't say no.
I'd be too scared to.

06:14.410 --> 06:17.459
- Lindsey, come say hello.
- I think she likes you.

06:24.610 --> 06:28.509
You remember Lindsey McDonald,
our point man on Miss Brewer's case?

06:30.009 --> 06:31.519
Did an excellent job.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.949
- Thank you, Lindsey.
- You're welcome.

06:38.410 --> 06:41.220
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

06:43.209 --> 06:44.439
Bye. Got a sec?

06:58.209 --> 06:59.470
Does she unnerve you?

07:00.610 --> 07:01.660
A little.

07:01.810 --> 07:05.290
Two minutes with her,
I feel like my spine's been fused.

07:06.009 --> 07:10.579
Still, one has to admire her talent
and her work ethic.

07:18.009 --> 07:21.589
- You okay? You look stressed.
- I've been putting in the hours--

07:22.209 --> 07:25.759
Well, that's a big part,
the perspiration.

07:27.009 --> 07:29.259
But the other part, the inspiration...

07:29.410 --> 07:31.689
...you've had a rough year
on that end.

07:34.810 --> 07:38.949
- I've made some bad choices.
- Well, I'll say.

07:40.810 --> 07:44.639
- Sending the rogue slayer after Angel?
- Among other things.

07:45.610 --> 07:48.730
But you had success in court.
You're pulling out of it.

07:49.810 --> 07:52.439
I'm fond of you.
I'd like to see you move up.

07:54.009 --> 07:57.029
- I'm glad to hear that, sir.
- Not everybody will.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.939
This is kind of
our harvest time of year...

08:01.810 --> 08:05.360
...where we separate the winners
from the dead weight.

08:07.209 --> 08:10.050
I have to say,
you don't seem that happy lately.

08:10.810 --> 08:13.480
Could I take a wild stab
as to what it might be?

08:14.410 --> 08:15.350
Sure.

08:16.209 --> 08:18.810
It's your age. You're a young man.

08:19.209 --> 08:22.300
You've hitched your wagon
to our bright star.

08:23.410 --> 08:26.709
But now you're starting to feel,
"Is that all there is?"

08:28.810 --> 08:33.379
- Sometimes you question things but--
- I did crazy things when I was young.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.399
Searching and all.

08:35.409 --> 08:39.379
Took me a while to realize how
the world was and where I belonged.

08:40.808 --> 08:43.200
Actually, the world isn't
that complicated.

08:43.808 --> 08:46.299
It's made for those
who know how to use it.

08:46.809 --> 08:49.649
- Yes, sir.
- Don't give me that "Yes, sir" crap.

08:50.409 --> 08:53.080
I want you to think
about these things.

08:55.210 --> 08:58.620
You won't be happy till you find
your place in the world.

09:00.009 --> 09:02.889
Enough of the old guy's lecture.
Down to business.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.610
I doubt she had a happy childhood.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.529
- Sir?
- Our blind friend, Vanessa.

09:10.210 --> 09:14.669
She was terribly abused, the details
of which are tragic and shocking.

09:15.610 --> 09:18.139
You should create them.
Sooner, rather than later.

09:19.210 --> 09:22.259
She'll do something
that requires a strong defense.

09:22.809 --> 09:27.090
Strong defense, alibis, creative
alternatives to incarceration.

09:28.210 --> 09:32.139
She's an invaluable tool to some
of our most important clients.

09:32.409 --> 09:33.669
What will she do?

09:34.809 --> 09:38.110
There's some children arriving.
They pose a threat.

09:41.409 --> 09:42.740
Some children?

09:43.809 --> 09:45.740
Is this too shocking for you?

09:46.809 --> 09:48.909
I'm thinking it might be, for a jury.

09:49.210 --> 09:53.070
Which is why I'm thinking her
terrible childhood drove her to it.

09:54.009 --> 09:58.330
Not guilty by reason of insanity.
But she probably won't be caught.

10:03.009 --> 10:04.409
Who are these children?

10:04.809 --> 10:07.129
It's best we know
only what we need to...

10:09.009 --> 10:12.379
...without forgetting the important
part we play in the whole.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.000
You'll want to get right on it.

10:28.570 --> 10:31.450
- They acquitted her. Hung jury.
- I'm sorry, Angel.

10:32.169 --> 10:34.840
How can I fight evil
if they won't put it away?

10:35.769 --> 10:39.139
- It's not your fault.
- No, it's not my fault.

10:39.370 --> 10:43.759
I didn't cause it, and I can't fix it.
I can't do anything about it.

10:46.570 --> 10:50.639
Well, she's guilty.
She's guilty and they let her go.

10:51.370 --> 10:55.200
I saw her murder a man, and I can't
even testify to that in court.

10:56.169 --> 10:59.049
- Maybe in night court--
- It's their court, not mine.

10:59.769 --> 11:01.629
- Whose?
- Their rules, their game.

11:02.169 --> 11:06.490
- You mean the Wolfram-and-Hart types.
- I have no place in their world.

11:07.570 --> 11:10.029
- Angel--!
- How can I fight if I can't get in?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.889
You have a place.
We'll fight elsewhere.

11:12.970 --> 11:17.539
It's still their world, Wesley.
Structured for power, not truth.

11:19.570 --> 11:22.129
It's their system,
and it's one that works.

11:23.169 --> 11:25.909
It works because there's no guilt...

11:26.169 --> 11:28.980
...there's no torment,
no consequences.

11:30.970 --> 11:31.980
It's pure.

11:35.769 --> 11:37.629
I remember what that was like.

11:39.970 --> 11:42.070
Sometimes I miss that clarity.

11:44.169 --> 11:48.029
But not the "trying to kill
your friends and family" part, right?

11:48.970 --> 11:49.980
Just checking.

11:51.370 --> 11:52.980
Nothing ever changes.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.629
I need your help.

12:06.970 --> 12:08.230
What do you mean?

12:09.970 --> 12:11.159
I want out.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.379
You probably think this is a trick.

12:28.129 --> 12:29.850
Are you afraid of me, Lindsey?

12:30.529 --> 12:32.490
You think maybe I might kill you?

12:35.330 --> 12:36.200
No.

12:36.529 --> 12:38.779
I'm smelling a whole lot of fear.

12:38.929 --> 12:42.259
Big, stinky, mortal terror.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.289
So, no.

12:45.529 --> 12:49.529
I don't think this is a trick.
I think it's a big joke.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.220
I don't like this any more than you.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.690
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

12:55.129 --> 12:58.429
You sold your soul for
a nice office and a company car.

12:59.330 --> 13:03.019
You think you got me all figured out?
You know everything about me?

13:03.529 --> 13:07.179
- Everything I need to know.
- Your father was a merchant, right?

13:07.730 --> 13:12.149
Linen and silk? Did pretty well?
Had servants until you killed them?

13:13.730 --> 13:14.779
Just the one.

13:14.929 --> 13:17.600
Well, our files aren't
a hundred percent.

13:18.529 --> 13:22.080
But I guess it's fair to say
you've never seen real poverty.

13:22.730 --> 13:25.429
I'm talking dirt poor,
no shoes, no toilet...

13:25.730 --> 13:28.639
...six kids in a room.
After flu season, we were four.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.350
I was 7 when they took the house.
Came right in and took it.

13:33.529 --> 13:37.110
And my daddy's being nice,
joking while he signs the deed.

13:38.330 --> 13:41.000
My choice was to be stepped on
or get stepping...

13:41.330 --> 13:45.789
...and I swore I'd never be the guy
with the stupid grin on my face...

13:46.730 --> 13:49.779
- ...while my life got dribbled out.
- Sorry, I nodded off.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.980
Get to the part where you're evil.

13:55.129 --> 13:58.710
I found out about a job.
The blind woman. Vanessa Brewer.

13:59.330 --> 14:01.679
- That you got off.
- There's a new contract.

14:02.330 --> 14:05.309
- Save the lawyer talk--
- She's gonna kill some kids.

14:07.730 --> 14:11.210
I've worked pretty hairy deals.
Comes with the turf. But this....

14:11.929 --> 14:13.049
What do you know?

14:13.129 --> 14:16.990
Almost nothing. Some kids
from overseas, job's in a few days.

14:17.929 --> 14:19.259
I need more.

14:19.730 --> 14:22.539
There's some files.
They'd be in the firm vault.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.980
- Get them.
- I can't go back.

14:25.129 --> 14:28.539
- You understand what that place is?
- I don't sense resolve--

14:29.330 --> 14:32.769
They constantly watch you.
Other companies have drug testing...

14:33.529 --> 14:36.059
...they have mind readers.
They'd kill me.

14:36.529 --> 14:39.269
That's an acceptable risk.
You're panicking.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.759
You can't believe
how bad you let things get.

14:45.529 --> 14:47.210
That's not change.

14:48.529 --> 14:52.110
You gotta make a decision to change.
That's something you do by yourself.

14:53.929 --> 14:56.320
Most people? They never do.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.789
I get myself killed,
that'll convince you I've changed?

15:01.730 --> 15:02.850
It's a start.

15:04.730 --> 15:07.470
Vault's at sublevel 2,
opposite the boiler room.

15:08.330 --> 15:10.080
- Sewer access?
- Burn your way in.

15:10.730 --> 15:13.190
Why are you going?
I thought he was doing it.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.980
- Two-man job. And the vault?
- My pass.

15:16.129 --> 15:18.590
I need it to get in
because of tight security...

15:19.129 --> 15:21.409
...but I can leave it
downstairs for you.

15:22.129 --> 15:25.289
- Again, I say--
- It's guarded. Demon.

15:25.730 --> 15:27.799
Doesn't like unauthorized visits.

15:28.129 --> 15:30.450
- What kind of demon?
- Pregothian, I think.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.620
- I'll get you a profile, weaknesses.
- Right.

15:34.730 --> 15:39.299
I'll do my best with security. You
gotta move fast because-- Damn it!

15:40.129 --> 15:42.230
- What?
- The threshold has shamans.

15:42.529 --> 15:45.200
They can sense a vampire
crossing the threshold.

15:46.129 --> 15:48.340
- Won't be a problem.
- Seems pretty simple...

15:48.529 --> 15:50.669
...except for the
"you'll get caught" factor.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.610
"The righteous shall walk
a thorny path."

15:58.129 --> 16:01.639
Yeah, I can get ahold of one.
But why would I want to?

16:02.330 --> 16:04.330
For justice and doing the right thing?

16:04.730 --> 16:07.399
Not interested in some
rich guy's heartbreak.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.090
You're low.

16:14.330 --> 16:15.909
Just my opinion.

16:26.929 --> 16:29.840
- Give me one good reason.
- It'll be very dangerous.

16:31.129 --> 16:32.139
Okay.

17:10.848 --> 17:14.569
Entering sublevel 3,
Priority clearance required,

17:24.650 --> 17:25.910
Lilah.

17:26.450 --> 17:28.339
- You scared me.
- Me too.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.720
I'm sorry. I'm always
in too much of a hurry.

17:33.049 --> 17:34.490
I think we all are.

17:36.650 --> 17:40.410
- Oh, yeah. Doing some research?
- Only when I want it done right.

17:41.450 --> 17:45.349
I can make myself look stupid,
but I hate it when some clerk does.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.690
I was under the impression
you never touch a book anymore.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.460
Little secret between you and me.

17:54.650 --> 17:58.859
If the amoebas find out you're willing
to read, you lose their respect.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.839
Personnel approaching security office,

19:07.250 --> 19:09.529
- Hello, Mr. McDonald.
- Howard, got a minute?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.410
Sure.

19:12.650 --> 19:16.269
I saw the Series 7500 video
surveillance system you suggested.

19:17.450 --> 19:20.150
Do I need cellular override
and digital link?

19:20.450 --> 19:23.400
- It seems a little overkill.
- Better safe than sorry.

19:30.650 --> 19:35.220
They said it was true, but I didn't
believe them. Damn, here it is!

19:36.049 --> 19:38.750
Evil white folks
really do have a mecca.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.210
Now, girls, don't get riled up,

19:45.650 --> 19:48.950
You just step on my foot?
Was that my foot you stepped on?

19:49.250 --> 19:52.130
Are you assaulting me
Up in this haven of justice?

19:54.650 --> 19:56.160
Somebody get me a lawyer.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.000
My civil rights
have seriously been violated.

20:01.849 --> 20:05.259
I get it. You all can cater
to the demon and the dead man...

20:05.450 --> 20:07.700
...but what about the black man?

20:13.250 --> 20:16.059
I'd love to stay and chat, but....
Yo, fellas!

20:27.049 --> 20:29.609
We got a vampire on the premises.
Repeat, a vampire.

20:45.049 --> 20:47.720
Well, looks like you got
your hands full so....

21:19.690 --> 21:21.410
Thank you, Wesley.

21:43.089 --> 21:47.269
What's all the excitement? A vampire
in the lobby, did I hear that right?

21:47.890 --> 21:49.289
Never a dull moment.

22:43.690 --> 22:45.200
We're done. Get out now.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.430
Can you believe this? It's a sweep.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.069
I'll never make my lunch.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.740
What is it?

23:25.690 --> 23:27.089
Mind readers.

23:36.170 --> 23:37.960
Shouldn't we have been memoed?

23:38.569 --> 23:41.240
That's why they're called
random mind readings.

23:42.170 --> 23:46.700
It's Lilah. It looks like I won't
be able to make the 1:00. Great.

24:33.170 --> 24:36.289
I have to say this is a shame.
It's just a shame.

24:37.369 --> 24:41.230
Whenever I hear of disloyalty,
it hurts me.

24:43.970 --> 24:45.690
Hurts me personally.

24:46.970 --> 24:50.759
But this sort of thing
must be dealt with quickly...

24:52.369 --> 24:53.839
...and cleanly.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.710
And unambiguously.

25:06.769 --> 25:10.490
- I'm sorry, Lee, I truly am.
- What? No.

25:10.970 --> 25:13.390
You've been in secret talks
with Klein and Gabler.

25:16.369 --> 25:17.700
They approached me.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.420
You planned on taking
clients with you.

25:20.569 --> 25:22.849
You don't understand.
They misread me.

25:23.569 --> 25:24.829
I wanted them to think--

25:33.769 --> 25:36.329
Terminating an employee
is never pleasant.

25:38.569 --> 25:39.619
That's all.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.109
Lindsey.

25:46.970 --> 25:49.069
Why don't you hang on for a minute?

26:02.289 --> 26:04.220
- Lindsey?
- He's not with you?

26:04.690 --> 26:06.339
That can't be good.

26:06.490 --> 26:08.069
Something must've happened.

26:09.490 --> 26:10.539
You're not going back?

26:10.690 --> 26:15.079
If he made it, he'll come. If not,
there's nothing I can do. We're busy.

26:16.089 --> 26:18.720
- So you got the files then?
- Right here.

26:20.890 --> 26:24.049
- Which one is it?
- I don't know. We'll have to find it.

26:25.690 --> 26:27.410
Angel, what's this?

26:29.289 --> 26:30.799
I'm not sure.

26:36.490 --> 26:39.259
- Ancient Aramaic, if I'm not mistaken.
- Yeah?

26:43.690 --> 26:46.180
- Was there a reason you took this?
- Yeah.

26:47.289 --> 26:48.410
And that would be...?

26:52.690 --> 26:53.920
I don't really know.

26:55.089 --> 26:58.000
Well, I'll get to work
translating them.

26:58.690 --> 27:01.529
Guys? Might want to
translate this first.

27:07.089 --> 27:10.349
- It's encrypted.
- I bet the rest of these are too.

27:11.289 --> 27:12.369
Great.

27:21.490 --> 27:24.470
What a pity. You can't get that
out of the carpet.

27:25.690 --> 27:27.549
Believe me, we've tried.

27:35.289 --> 27:36.690
Are you afraid?

27:39.490 --> 27:43.140
I can see why. You betrayed
this firm by allying yourself...

27:43.690 --> 27:47.099
...with someone who has given us
a great deal of grief.

27:48.490 --> 27:51.509
You've stolen important documents
from our vault.

27:52.089 --> 27:55.140
Tried to sabotaged
an extremely important case.

27:55.690 --> 27:59.019
And in the course of this
egregious behavior, you lied to us.

28:01.690 --> 28:03.339
More importantly, to me.

28:05.890 --> 28:07.640
Did I leave anything out?

28:08.890 --> 28:10.009
No, sir.

28:10.690 --> 28:13.779
Did you actually believe
I wouldn't learn everything?

28:14.890 --> 28:17.240
Lindsey, this is a delicate moment.

28:17.890 --> 28:21.720
I nod to Phil behind me, and he'll
put a bullet in your head.

28:25.690 --> 28:28.950
I didn't want to lie to you.
I didn't want to betray you.

28:29.890 --> 28:30.940
I just wanted out.

28:33.490 --> 28:35.769
Well then, you're in a crisis, son.

28:36.490 --> 28:37.890
A crisis of faith.

28:39.490 --> 28:40.859
Do you believe in love?

28:42.490 --> 28:44.349
I'm not speaking romantically.

28:44.890 --> 28:48.440
I'm talking about that sharp,
clear sense of self a man gains...

28:49.089 --> 28:51.650
...once he's truly found
his place in the world.

28:52.089 --> 28:56.549
It's no mean feat, since most men are
cowards and just move with the crowd.

28:58.690 --> 29:01.289
A very few make their own destinies.

29:01.690 --> 29:05.380
They have moral courage, and they
know how to behave in a crisis.

29:07.089 --> 29:08.420
Like now?

29:09.490 --> 29:10.680
Like now.

29:11.890 --> 29:14.630
You have everything it takes
to go all the way:

29:14.890 --> 29:17.799
Drive, ambition, excellence.

29:19.089 --> 29:21.410
But you don't know where you belong.

29:22.089 --> 29:23.809
And until you do...

29:23.890 --> 29:26.799
...we both have some
important questions to answer.

29:27.490 --> 29:29.099
Now, my first one is:

29:31.690 --> 29:34.289
Do I nod to my friend behind me?

29:38.890 --> 29:39.690
No.

29:40.089 --> 29:44.509
No, I don't. Because I know you,
and I know something about character.

29:46.089 --> 29:49.740
What you actually need is
a few days off to think about it.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.220
And I'm sure once you have,
you're gonna do the right thing.

29:56.289 --> 29:57.799
I can-- I can go?

30:01.089 --> 30:02.279
You can go.

30:05.890 --> 30:06.690
Lindsey.

30:08.289 --> 30:09.730
I believe in you.

30:11.890 --> 30:13.920
Look deep enough inside yourself.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.289
You'll find that love.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.980
I'm back to the desktop,
Willow. What do I do now?

30:24.410 --> 30:28.059
Okay, done that. Back to file list.

30:31.009 --> 30:31.920
Any luck?

30:32.210 --> 30:34.460
She's been on the phone for two hours.

30:35.210 --> 30:37.240
Guess what they've been doing?

30:38.210 --> 30:39.890
- Saving the world?
- Well, yeah.

30:40.009 --> 30:43.059
They've been breaking
encrypted computer files too.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.490
- What are the odds, huh?
- I know. What?

30:46.609 --> 30:50.650
- Oh, no one. Just Wesley.
- Cordelia, can she get us in?

30:56.809 --> 30:59.549
- Willow says hey.
- Hey.

31:00.410 --> 31:01.809
Okay. Yeah.

31:02.809 --> 31:04.039
I see it.

31:04.609 --> 31:06.710
Tag file. Okay.

31:07.609 --> 31:08.769
Left click.

31:10.009 --> 31:11.690
There it is. Back door.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.869
We're in. Thanks, Will.

31:16.009 --> 31:18.890
Personnel file, Vanessa Brewer.

31:22.009 --> 31:24.470
She lost her sight when she was 21.

31:25.009 --> 31:28.339
- On purpose. She did it to herself.
- Oh, dear.

31:29.210 --> 31:32.650
And she spent five years in Pajaur,
studying the Nanjin...

31:33.410 --> 31:35.619
- ...which explains her power.
- It does?

31:36.410 --> 31:39.289
Yes, the order of the Nanjin,
cave-dwelling monks.

31:39.410 --> 31:42.960
They believe enlightenment
is seeing with the heart, not mind.

31:43.609 --> 31:47.470
So self-mutilating, psycho assassin
chick reached enlightenment?

31:48.410 --> 31:52.309
She's more sensitive to her
surroundings than a sighted person...

31:53.210 --> 31:57.670
- ...which makes her unstoppable.
- No one's unstoppable. What's her job?

31:59.210 --> 32:01.140
Here it is. Lindsey was right.

32:01.609 --> 32:04.000
Children. Three of them. Seers.

32:04.609 --> 32:08.579
Found in different remote areas,
brought together for the first time.

32:09.410 --> 32:13.799
They're blind. Together, they have
power to see into the heart of things.

32:14.210 --> 32:17.400
A holy triumvirate.
As they mature, so does their power.

32:18.410 --> 32:22.410
Which makes them a real threat
to Wolfram and Hart. Sorry I'm late.

32:23.210 --> 32:26.049
- I hope you didn't worry.
- We figured you were dead.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.960
So you made it out okay.

32:28.609 --> 32:31.799
Yeah, but they'll soon find out
which files are missing.

32:32.809 --> 32:35.549
We gotta move fast.
When do the children arrive?

32:35.809 --> 32:37.210
They came this morning.

32:37.609 --> 32:40.700
They're at a safe house
until their mentor arrives.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.690
- He's coming in tonight.
- Not safe. There's an address.

32:45.410 --> 32:48.529
Intercept the mentor.
Keep him away from that house.

32:49.609 --> 32:51.890
- We'll bring the kids to him.
- Okay.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.720
Get the kids out of here!

35:24.250 --> 35:26.639
It's all right. You're all right.

35:39.769 --> 35:42.190
The children are safe
with their mentor.

35:42.769 --> 35:43.750
Good.

35:46.369 --> 35:48.539
They have an important role to play.

35:49.969 --> 35:52.989
This is how Wolfram and Hart
knew of their coming.

35:57.170 --> 36:00.960
- You know what it is?
- The Prophecies of Aberjian, I think.

36:01.969 --> 36:05.300
For centuries, thought lost.
I translated some of the text.

36:06.170 --> 36:08.449
It mentions
the children you saved today.

36:09.769 --> 36:12.929
I also believe
I know why you were drawn to it.

36:13.969 --> 36:16.530
There's an entire passage about you.

36:18.769 --> 36:22.980
It doesn't call you by name,
but it tells of a vampire with a soul.

36:25.969 --> 36:29.090
- This doesn't surprise you?
- No.

36:30.170 --> 36:33.539
- You said you didn't know what it was.
- I didn't, but--

36:34.369 --> 36:37.320
- Somehow you did?
- Yeah.

36:39.170 --> 36:42.789
There is a design, Angel.
Hidden in the chaos as it may be...

36:43.369 --> 36:44.380
...but it's there.

36:46.369 --> 36:48.090
And you have your place in it.

37:05.570 --> 37:06.440
Holland.

37:07.969 --> 37:09.480
Hello, Lindsey.

37:10.969 --> 37:13.780
I'm sorry. I did what I had to.

37:14.570 --> 37:17.030
You saved the children.
That's very noble.

37:17.570 --> 37:20.619
- I brought the disks back.
- Of course, you made copies.

37:21.170 --> 37:24.010
A few things.
Just enough to keep me safe.

37:24.769 --> 37:28.420
- What does safe mean to you?
- Not warring with Wolfram and Hart.

37:29.570 --> 37:33.010
- Having my own life.
- Haven't you learned anything?

37:33.769 --> 37:36.300
No one has that.
We're all parts of a whole.

37:37.369 --> 37:38.909
Like Wolfram and Hart.

37:39.170 --> 37:42.119
I picked you when you were
a sophomore at Hastings...

37:42.769 --> 37:44.699
...not because you were smart...

37:45.170 --> 37:48.429
...or a poor kid who had
to do better than anyone else...

37:48.769 --> 37:53.300
...but because you had potential
for seeing things as they are.

37:54.769 --> 37:58.840
It's not about good or evil.
It's about who wields the most power.

38:00.170 --> 38:02.800
We wield a lot,
and the world's better for it.

38:03.170 --> 38:05.659
- I didn't come back--
- Why did you come back?

38:06.769 --> 38:10.099
To return some disks?
Take a moral stand?

38:10.369 --> 38:11.630
I don't think so.

38:12.170 --> 38:14.449
You called me by my first name.

38:15.170 --> 38:18.650
You never did that before.
You wouldn't have had the nerve.

38:19.369 --> 38:22.780
But you're different now.
You stood up to us and won.

38:23.570 --> 38:25.849
You know how many people
have that nerve?

38:26.570 --> 38:31.139
I can count them on one hand. I need
people like that working for us.

38:35.570 --> 38:39.360
- You're offering me my job back?
- No. I'm offering you a new job.

38:40.369 --> 38:44.269
A permanent one, with a thundering
raise and ungodly benefits.

38:45.769 --> 38:48.929
In fact, I'm offering you
this very office.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.050
I'm going upstairs.

38:52.369 --> 38:55.489
What I'm offering you, Lindsey,
is the world.

38:56.570 --> 38:59.449
I know you pretty well,
and I bet you'll take it.

39:04.369 --> 39:06.760
You may not know me
as well as you think.

39:08.570 --> 39:12.539
As I told you, it's a decision
each person has to make for himself.

39:13.369 --> 39:17.760
If you want it, it's yours.
If you don't, walk out this door.

39:18.170 --> 39:19.849
I'm going upstairs now.
