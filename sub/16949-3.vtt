Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:03.636 --> 00:05.739
{\an7}I brought you something.
That's for you and Moniece.

00:05.805 --> 00:07.340
{\an8}Trying to be funny?

00:05.805 --> 00:07.340
{\an7}No.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.843
{\an8}And Moniece told me she want
to have another kid with you.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.478
{\an7}Saw a little
15-second clip.

00:11.544 --> 00:12.879
{\an8}What'd you do now?

00:12.946 --> 00:14.514
{\an8}I spilled
all the (bleep) tea.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.315
{\an8}Let's call a spade
a (bleep) spade.

00:16.383 --> 00:18.651
{\an8}Bitch, I (bleep) your (bleep),
and, yes, I (bleep) liked it.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.986
{\an7}(Princess)
I asked Ray about it.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.422
{\an7}He's like, "I (bleep) that girl
one time at a party,

00:22.489 --> 00:24.090
{\an7}and five of his homeys
(bleep) you since then."

00:24.157 --> 00:27.060
{\an8}If you had to send one message
to Moniece, what would you say?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.962
{\an7}Be ready 'cause
I'm coming for you, bitch.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.601
{\an8}There will be a prenup.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.036
{\an7}Talked to Princess about it.
She wasn't happy.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.605
{\an8}But I got it figured out.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.507
{\an7}I had this prenup
in my hand,

00:40.573 --> 00:42.809
{\an7}and I'm-- I'm-- I'ma just
rip the whole thing up.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.578
{\an8}(crowd cheering)

00:45.645 --> 00:47.347
{\an8}(Max)
I was thinking
about what you said.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.382
{\an8}We need to have
a savings for our son.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.552
{\an7}I just did an EP for 27,000,
so all that money is his.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.821
{\an8}Money, Brandus.
Yay!

00:54.888 --> 00:56.389
{\an8}B. told me she's been
with Princess,

00:56.456 --> 00:58.525
{\an7}planning for the wedding,
doing all this stuff every day.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.460
{\an7}Her and Princess ain't
started doing nothing yet.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.862
{\an7}(Shanda)
Just be honest.
Is it true?

01:02.929 --> 01:04.030
{\an8}(Willie)
No.

01:04.096 --> 01:05.031
{\an7}You've never met up
with her?

01:04.096 --> 01:05.031
{\an6}Mm-mmm.

01:05.098 --> 01:06.266
{\an8}You don't text her?

01:05.098 --> 01:06.266
{\an6}Mm-mmm.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.769
{\an8}You were really
(bleep) thirsty.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.738
{\an8}Have you ever felt
like I gave a (bleep)?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.306
{\an8}You still telling me
you love me, right?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.306
{\an6}When?

01:13.373 --> 01:14.574
{\an8}Are you serious?!

01:14.641 --> 01:16.242
{\an8}So, she came all the way
from Chicago to show me

01:16.309 --> 01:18.678
{\an7}some text messages
and ain't seen you since 2004.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.879
{\an8}She hasn't seen me
since 2004.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.081
{\an8}It don't (bleep)
make sense to me.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.850
{\an7}All we want to know
is the truth at this point.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.151
{\an8}Why are you here?

01:25.218 --> 01:27.220

(Shanda)
A couple days ago,

02:07.060 --> 02:09.262
this crazy bitch
declare her love for my husband.

02:09.329 --> 02:13.066
We've gone through this before,
but I know, me being a wife,

02:13.132 --> 02:15.168
I was supposed to stay strong
because we have a family

02:15.235 --> 02:16.703
and that's what a wife's
supposed to do.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.738
{\an8}But if Willie don't figure out
why this keeps happening,

02:18.805 --> 02:19.973
{\an8}our marriage could be over.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.674
{\an8}First off, I want to
thank you for coming

02:21.741 --> 02:23.943
and even doing this,
you know, but, I mean--

02:24.010 --> 02:25.612
{\an1}I just want you to know
from the bottom of my heart

02:25.678 --> 02:27.213
how sorry I am.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.415
This right here has left such
a mess between me and my wife,

02:29.482 --> 02:30.717
but I'ma clean it up

02:30.783 --> 02:32.051
because my marriage
is not gonna break up

02:32.118 --> 02:33.920
over no chick like Kyesha.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.689
{\an3}Yeah, um...

02:36.756 --> 02:38.358
{\an1}I definitely want to get to
the bottom of the Kyesha thing.

02:38.424 --> 02:41.694
You know, and I just want to
let you know that no matter--

02:41.761 --> 02:43.129
{\an1}What made you
do that (bleep)?

02:43.196 --> 02:46.666
What is it that keep allowing
you to (bleep) up like that?

02:46.733 --> 02:48.234
{\an5}We've been here before.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.234
{\an3}Yeah.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.369
You know what I'm saying?

02:49.435 --> 02:50.937
{\an1}With, you know,
your past infidelities.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.405
{\an1}And is it
the happiness part?

02:52.472 --> 02:54.607
{\an1}You're not happy,
obviously,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.976
{\an1}in this marriage if you
keep doing the same (bleep).

02:57.043 --> 02:58.678
Or is it something that
you have within yourself

02:58.745 --> 03:01.247
but you feel like you can't
stop doing, or what is it?

03:01.314 --> 03:02.382
It was just
text messages,

03:02.448 --> 03:03.516
and as bad as the
text messages were--

03:03.583 --> 03:05.518
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.654
{\an1}I don't even care
what it was at this point.

03:07.720 --> 03:12.091
{\an1}None of it makes a difference
because you did it again.

03:12.158 --> 03:13.660
{\an3}I did.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.895
When Willie and I got together
and had kids, we were young,

03:15.962 --> 03:18.164
and I knew that we would make
mistakes in our relationship.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.499
We're not kids anymore,

03:19.566 --> 03:20.733
and I think it's time
for him to be the man

03:20.800 --> 03:22.001
that he vowed to be

03:22.068 --> 03:24.037
and for me to focus on me
finally.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.738
{\an1}At this point,
I'm gonna get my ass

03:25.805 --> 03:28.007
{\an1}in the studio whether--
you know, period.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.509
{\an1}When I need you to watch,
you'll watch the kids.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.411
But you know I'll always
be a support system.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.047
{\an1}And I know, but now it's time
to think about me.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.583
{\an1}And I need
to (bleep) do that.

03:36.649 --> 03:37.650
{\an1}I need to do that
for myself.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.786
{\an1}I need to
do that for my baby.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.220
{\an3}I get it.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.590
{\an8}Look, I didn't expect Shanda
to take me back easy.

03:43.656 --> 03:44.958
{\an8}I know I (bleep) up.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.392
{\an8}A huge (bleep)-up.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.494
{\an8}But I love my wife, and I'ma do
whatever it takes, man,

03:48.561 --> 03:49.996
to make sure that she
understands that

03:50.063 --> 03:52.565
and that I will never
make this mistake again.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.068
Will you allow me
to make it better?

03:55.134 --> 03:57.971
{\an1}Well, that's all you got
at this point.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.707
I'm sorry, though.
Okay?

04:00.773 --> 04:03.109
And I promise you,
I'ma never do it again.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.911
Do you hear me?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.713
{\an1}I'ma hold you
to that (bleep).

04:06.779 --> 04:08.214
Hold me to it.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.817
Can I make you happy?

04:10.883 --> 04:11.985

04:12.051 --> 04:13.519
I'll do the work.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.301
{\an8}Jhalae was an online
clothing boutique

Problem was I didn't have money
to invest in that.

05:14.647 --> 05:19.852
So I took the 27,000
my husband gave me for our son

05:19.919 --> 05:23.022

$27,000,

08:52.064 --> 08:53.866
{\an3}What?!

08:53.933 --> 08:56.168
{\an1}So, I found
my mom a place.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.604
Oh, my God.
Thank the Lord Jesus.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.240
A1's mom, Pam, she moved
here from Kansas City

09:01.307 --> 09:03.109
so she could be closer
to her son.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.243
I get that.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.945
Two weeks
turn into six months.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.046
You know what it is?

09:07.113 --> 09:09.348
{\an1}I think ever since
she's been out here,

09:09.415 --> 09:11.984
{\an1}I feel like it's like
your mom came in

09:12.051 --> 09:15.054
{\an1}and just was, like,
off tops, just drilling her.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.456
You make it sound like
my mom is the devil

09:17.523 --> 09:18.791
and your mom is an angel.

09:18.858 --> 09:19.792
Let's be real here.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.661
Your mom is hard
to deal with,

09:21.727 --> 09:23.529
especially living
under our roof.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.231
We have no privacy
as a couple.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.399
She's right there.

09:26.465 --> 09:27.733
It's like, bruh,
if I turn around,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.268
I feel like I can
barely walk around naked.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.970
Hopefully
things get better

09:31.037 --> 09:33.072
when my mom move
to her new place.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.573

Lyrica's mom?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.309
She just as bad.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.477
I don't even want to focus
on our moms right now

09:38.544 --> 09:40.479

Of course my mom's
coming to see me perform.

My mom's not gonna
fall back on my show.

building a family,

{\an1}there has to be a separation

figuring it out.

15:02.935 --> 15:03.902

I need to hear.

Princess reached out to me

15:18.317 --> 15:20.152
{\an8}because she clearly feels
some type of way

15:20.219 --> 15:22.187
{\an8}about the things
that I've been saying.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.657
{\an8}I'm going to oblige
this conversation

15:24.723 --> 15:25.958
{\an8}because I can't keep
letting these bitches

15:26.025 --> 15:27.493
{\an8}get a rise out of me.

15:31.463 --> 15:32.698
I'm sick and tired

15:32.765 --> 15:34.733
of hiding behind cameras
and computer screens.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.268
Say it to my face.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.505
{\an4}Why you always have
my mother(bleep) name
in your mouth?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.909
{\an1}I just don't understand.
I don't understand.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.944
{\an1}I cannot put my finger
on it, Moniece.

15:46.011 --> 15:49.148
{\an1}I done let too many
interviews fly over my head.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.616
{\an1}Bitch, you crossed
the line.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.284
{\an1}You slandered
my (bleep) name.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.419
You know why?

15:53.485 --> 15:55.354
My issue with you began

15:55.421 --> 15:58.724
{\an1}when you said
what you said about my son.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.427
{\an1}No, stop with
the motherhood stuff.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.362
Moniece is always trying
to play the victim,

16:03.429 --> 16:05.998
and she's always using criticism
of her motherhood

16:06.065 --> 16:08.033
as grounds
to bash somebody else.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.169
Moniece likes to dish (bleep)
to everybody else

16:10.235 --> 16:12.137
but can't handle it

16:12.204 --> 16:13.305
All this Twitter
finger (bleep),

16:13.372 --> 16:14.573
{\an1}you like to sit here
and attack people

16:14.640 --> 16:15.874
from behind your computer

16:15.941 --> 16:17.209
{\an1}like you're some type
of Twitter thug.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.811
(Moniece)
If Princess had a child

16:18.877 --> 16:21.513
then maybe she would understand
the maternal instinct

16:21.580 --> 16:24.350
to protect your baby
and serve the first bitch

16:24.416 --> 16:26.418
to cross that boundary.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.487
{\an1}Say all this (bleep)
to my face now.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.888

{\an5}Let me know when you're done.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.223

16:31.290 --> 16:32.491
You're a weak-ass bitch.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.525
{\an6}Okay.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.525
You're pathetic.

16:33.592 --> 16:34.660
{\an1}You can't say nothing
to my face.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.961
I'm sorry that
you feel that way.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.496
{\an1}I'm sorry that
you are that way.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.864
You're on the shade,

16:38.931 --> 16:41.133
{\an1}you've been on the Internet
attacking people all day.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.534
Because people
attack me all day!

16:42.601 --> 16:43.635
{\an4}No.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.635
{\an3}Yes.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.471
{\an5}You do it, I see it.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.471
No, Princess.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.340
You're not letting me
get a word out edgewise.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.543
Just relax for two seconds.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.011
I apologize.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.080
{\an5}You don't have to--

16:53.078 --> 16:55.080
{\an1}It's a little too
late for that.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.483
But when you speak
on my child...

16:57.549 --> 16:59.084
{\an4}Bitch.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.084
...you never
apologized for that.

16:59.151 --> 17:00.185
{\an1}Bitch, I don't
have to apologize.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.787
You didn't
apologize for that.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.956
So if you can't apologize

17:04.021 --> 17:06.558
for the things that
you said about my child

17:06.625 --> 17:07.593
and the things
that you said about me--

17:07.659 --> 17:08.926
{\an1}Bitch, (bleep) you.
(bleep) you.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.963
{\an1}Well, then the conversation
is over.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.431
{\an1}Don't think
that's it's over, bitch.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.499
From this day forward--

17:17.269 --> 17:19.438
(Princess)
If Moniece thinks for one second

17:19.505 --> 17:22.674
that I bought that sorry-ass,
long-ass apology,

17:22.741 --> 17:24.877
she's got to be delusional.

17:24.943 --> 17:28.380
She's got no more chances
to say anything about me.

that you asking me
is inaccurate.

{\an7}Now she making me
wanting to investigate.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.927
{\an8}You want to tell the whole world
who you've been (bleep)

17:41.994 --> 17:43.429
{\an8}so our son can
go on the Internet

to see that (bleep).

{\an8}But to become a star,

(Lyrica)
Hey, guys.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.355
{\an6}Hey, honey.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.355
{\an1}Good job.

{\an5}You did amazing, beautiful.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.392
{\an1}Thank you.

19:20.459 --> 19:21.793
When I was Lyrica's age,

19:21.860 --> 19:24.263
I had already traveled
the whole word

19:24.329 --> 19:28.233
with the likes of Tina Turner,
Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.836
I want my daughter to be
the best that she can be.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.471
But this comes from experience,

19:32.538 --> 19:34.139
and she hasn't had
a lot of that.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.941
I was trying
to tell you to unzip.

19:36.008 --> 19:36.942
You know, you got
this dope body.

19:37.009 --> 19:37.976
Show it , Lyrica.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.112
Turn it around, jeez.

19:40.178 --> 19:41.847
{\an1}Didn't you say
she did amazing?

19:41.914 --> 19:43.615
{\an1}So why it's got to be
about her outfit?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.183
Why are you always
so combative?

19:45.250 --> 19:47.319
I'm trying to say
anything negative.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.855
I mean, I feel like sometimes
you just a little aggressive.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.024
'Cause you was like,
"Yeah!" Doing that.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.192
I just want to hear you
take it there.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.395
{\an1}See, I had a couple execs
texting me, like,

19:56.461 --> 19:58.730
{\an5}"Who else is singing, though?"

19:56.461 --> 19:58.730
{\an3}Well, good.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.032
They thought it was
a background singer.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.367
You know, A1's trying
to take jabs at my mom,

20:02.434 --> 20:04.002
act like she's new at this.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.404
You know, she worked
with some legends.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.240
A1, if you refer to me
as a backup singer again,

20:08.307 --> 20:10.042
me and you
gonna have a problem

20:10.108 --> 20:11.677
that's not gonna go away
anytime soon.

20:11.743 --> 20:12.844
I'm gonna be me.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.513
You can't change you me.
Change your mama.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.581
That's what you do.

20:15.647 --> 20:16.848
{\an1}We not even gonna talk
about my mama.

20:16.915 --> 20:17.849
Yeah, we're gonna
talk about your mama.

20:17.916 --> 20:18.750
{\an1}I'm not gonna talk
about my mama.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.851
When is she leaving?

20:19.918 --> 20:22.921
A1's mother, Pam,
dropped her bags

20:22.988 --> 20:25.123
in the middle
of my daughter's floor.

20:25.190 --> 20:28.260
It seems like it was years,
even though it was a few months.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.195
See's disrespectful
to my daughter.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.864
So when she's disrespects
my daughter, she calls me.

20:32.931 --> 20:33.899
What are you guys
even arguing about?

20:33.966 --> 20:35.133
We're not arguing.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.069
{\an1}Because you want her
to be single like you.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.871
My mom and A1 fight
all the time.

20:39.938 --> 20:42.307
And I'm always left
stuck in the middle.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.276
It's turning into an argument,
it's not that serious.

20:44.343 --> 20:45.577
I'm just being real.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.612
I just want to enjoy
and have a good time.

20:46.678 --> 20:47.980
Let's go meet the execs.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.748
{\an5}We'll be back.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.748
{\an3}Okay.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.850
What am I supposed to do,
just stand here?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.018

Everybody who knows me
knows that I'm a hard worker.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.892
{\an8}And lately I've been
in the studio like crazy.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.662
{\an8}So finally me and A1,
we have some serious alone time.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.498
{\an1}I need a foot rub
every day.

30:00.565 --> 30:01.666
I cook, I do--

30:01.733 --> 30:02.901
Do you know
what I need every day?

30:02.967 --> 30:04.169
We never gonna get into
the list of what I do.

30:04.235 --> 30:06.437
What you need every day?

30:06.504 --> 30:07.672
Uh, if you don't know...

30:07.739 --> 30:09.107
{\an1}(laughing)

30:09.174 --> 30:11.342
Do I-- do I need to make
a phone call or something?

30:11.409 --> 30:12.644
{\an1}No, I need to know
what you need every day.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.012
You know what I need.

30:14.078 --> 30:17.382
{\an1}Baby, if I drink all this wine,
I'm gonna be so drunk.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.884
{\an1}And then we would have,
like, amazing sex.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.019
No, don't drink all of it

30:21.085 --> 30:22.320
'cause you're
gonna go to sleep.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.088
{\an5}I'm not gonna go to sleep.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.088
Take a couple more sips.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.690
{\an1}This is gonna make me
more kinky.

30:25.757 --> 30:26.824
What are you talking about?

30:27.926 --> 30:30.161
(A1)
You know, I'm all for it.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.433
{\an1}Oh, my God.
You can't be serious.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.935
What's up, Mama?

30:37.001 --> 30:38.236
How you doing, son?

30:38.303 --> 30:39.604
I'm good.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.838
{\an7}You can't be serious
right now?

30:40.905 --> 30:42.840
{\an7}We're supposed to be chilling
just me and you.

30:47.645 --> 30:50.114
(Lyrica)
My mom may be a lot.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.952
But let's be clear,
A1's mom is no walk in the park.

30:54.018 --> 30:57.355
I know she's moving soon,
finally.

30:57.422 --> 30:59.257
But she was never
supposed to be my roomie.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.925
She treats me
like I'm the guest here.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.093
She's moody,

31:02.160 --> 31:03.761
acting funny in the morning,

31:03.828 --> 31:06.097
telling me about how
this is her son's house.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.633
She treats me like my name
ain't on this lease.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.834
You hungry now?

31:09.901 --> 31:11.202
Yeah, you gonna
whip something down?

31:11.269 --> 31:12.870
{\an4}Uh...

31:11.269 --> 31:12.870
We can just cook and...

31:14.472 --> 31:16.074
You know, we just gonna finish
watching this movie.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.642
{\an5}Okay, so what I'm gonna do...

31:16.140 --> 31:17.642
{\an3}Okay.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.278
{\an1}...is I'm gonna give you guys
mommy and son night.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.213
Y'all chill.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.182
Is there something
wrong with you?

31:24.249 --> 31:26.317
{\an1}The problem
that I have, Pam,

31:26.384 --> 31:28.152
{\an1}is that when
you first moved here,

31:28.219 --> 31:29.487
{\an1}you were supposed to stay
for two weeks.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.122
I didn't have to do (bleep).

31:31.189 --> 31:32.557
{\an1}Well, why are you here now?
Then you guys--

31:32.624 --> 31:34.192
Because it's my son.
Making sense?

31:34.259 --> 31:36.594
Mama, just let her finish
and then you can have your...

31:36.661 --> 31:38.096
A'ight?

31:38.162 --> 31:40.498
{\an1}I come here and then you think
I want to hear all this?

31:40.565 --> 31:43.534
{\an5}(Pam)
I can see she get
the attitudes from her mama.

31:43.601 --> 31:46.271
{\an8}They got the same name
and got the same attitude

31:46.337 --> 31:48.006
{\an8}and they both just alike.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.274
She's just over the top.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.608
Like, you come in here,
you interrupt our night.

31:50.675 --> 31:51.609
{\an1}We're chilling,
we're watching movies.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.211
You're starting (bleep).

31:53.278 --> 31:55.647
{\an1}You know, everybody can see
you think you Miss Diva anyway.

31:55.713 --> 31:56.948
{\an5}I don't think I'm anything.

31:55.713 --> 31:56.948
You and your mama.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.616
I think I'm Miss Diva?

31:58.683 --> 31:59.651
{\an5}I just live my life.

31:58.683 --> 31:59.651
You want to be stars.

31:59.717 --> 32:00.985
{\an5}We want to be stars?

31:59.717 --> 32:00.985
{\an3}Yes.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.186
Because--
Are you Aaliyah?

32:02.253 --> 32:03.221
{\an5}Are you a singer?

32:02.253 --> 32:03.221
You're not Aaliyah.

32:03.288 --> 32:04.555
Are you a singer?

32:04.622 --> 32:05.890
{\an5}Is your mama Tina Turner?

32:04.622 --> 32:05.890
Are you a singer?

32:05.957 --> 32:07.358
{\an5}Is y'all getting paid?

32:05.957 --> 32:07.358
Are you a singer?

32:07.425 --> 32:09.661
Ain't nobody Tina Turner,
they try to sound like it.

32:09.727 --> 32:11.129

32:14.399 --> 32:15.767
Hang on, just cook.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.368
{\an3}Okay.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.368

No, you chill.

Now, I ain't gonna lie,

32:20.338 --> 32:22.240
{\an8}it was supposed
to be romantic movie night

32:22.307 --> 32:23.608
{\an8}with me and my girl.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.311
Moms came home a little earlier
than expected,

But, (bleep), it's crazy
how my mom and my girl

32:31.282 --> 32:33.518
can't even get along
for two seconds.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.253
(bleep), if this continues
to happen,

32:35.320 --> 32:37.021
how the hell
is marriage gonna work?

She needs to be here
till she get her place.

32:41.726 --> 32:42.794
That's what it's gonna be.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.128
She's not
going anywhere, okay?

32:44.195 --> 32:46.197
{\an5}Unless she want to go.

32:44.195 --> 32:46.197
Listen, Mama, be quiet.

You need to suck that gut, boo.

{\an1}I didn't-- you know--
you didn't tell him yet?

34:20.291 --> 34:21.759
So he don't even know.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.428
Max is on his way here,

34:23.494 --> 34:25.862
and he still does not know

34:25.929 --> 34:28.433
or even how
I paid for the store.

34:28.498 --> 34:32.335

34:32.402 --> 34:34.972
and I'm able
to smooth things over

this place is.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.377
How much you owe?

You need to tell him.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.349
{\an8}The store looks okay.
It's not that bad.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.719

{\an5}(Max)
I don't know
what I just walked into.

35:33.331 --> 35:35.700
{\an8}B. told me it's
our people's event.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.368
{\an8}And I come inside
and she on stage,

35:37.435 --> 35:39.203
{\an8}and I'm like,
"What the (bleep) is going on?"

35:39.270 --> 35:40.972
It's Jhalae up in here!

35:41.038 --> 35:42.173

{\an5}Baby.

35:45.176 --> 35:46.978

35:47.044 --> 35:48.446
I want to talk to you.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.781
I've been with B. a long time,
and I always know when

35:50.848 --> 35:54.151
she trying to piece up
a story on some bull(bleep).

35:54.218 --> 35:55.553
So she better just
shoot it straight,

35:55.620 --> 35:57.622
'cause I'm really not in
the mood for all that right now.

35:57.688 --> 35:59.790
{\an5}Honestly, babe,
what do you think
about their store?

35:59.857 --> 36:02.293
{\an5}Like, it's nice, right?

35:59.857 --> 36:02.293
Yeah, it's very nice.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.295
{\an5}So I have some--

36:02.360 --> 36:04.295
I just don't understand

36:04.362 --> 36:06.764
{\an1}why I'm the only person
not involved.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.467
You are involved,
that is the good news.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.438
This is 50% our store.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.540
{\an1}Excuse me?

36:15.606 --> 36:17.208
We own 50%
of this store.

36:17.275 --> 36:18.442
{\an1}What?

36:19.710 --> 36:24.815
We are 50% invested
into this... store.

36:24.882 --> 36:25.950
All of the money--

36:26.017 --> 36:26.851
They just giving us

36:26.918 --> 36:27.985

I want you
to be happy right now

36:29.954 --> 36:31.689

36:31.756 --> 36:33.357

{\an4}What's up?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.628
The money is already--

36:37.695 --> 36:39.630
{\an3}Okay, um...

36:39.697 --> 36:41.132
What the (bleep), dude?

36:41.198 --> 36:44.335
So the... the tw--

36:44.402 --> 36:48.339
the 27,000 that you had...

36:48.406 --> 36:51.108
{\an1}Oh, I know you not talking
about my son's money.

36:51.175 --> 36:52.677
Look, listen, the money
is already coming back.

36:52.743 --> 36:54.779
It's cool,
I'm gonna talk to you later,

36:54.845 --> 36:56.847
{\an5}Listen, come back in here.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.847
I'm gonna talk to you later.

36:56.914 --> 36:58.115
I'm gonna talk to you later.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.418
{\an8}I'm not done talking to you--

37:00.484 --> 37:02.620
{\an8}Nah, I'm good.
What is you doing?

37:02.687 --> 37:04.221
{\an7}No!

37:02.687 --> 37:04.221
{\an8}Don't do that.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.724
{\an8}You're not going to leave me.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.359
{\an8}No!

37:13.064 --> 37:15.533
♪♪

37:17.268 --> 37:18.936
{\an8}I want you to be happy
right now,

37:19.003 --> 37:20.871
{\an8}because this is all for you.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.640
{\an1}Where you
get the money?

37:22.707 --> 37:23.941
That's the part I-- no.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.142
That's the what?

37:25.209 --> 37:27.511
The money is already--
okay.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.813
{\an3}Um...

37:28.879 --> 37:30.314
What the (bleep), dude?

37:30.381 --> 37:33.517
So the... the tw--

37:33.584 --> 37:38.155
the 27,000
that you had...

37:38.222 --> 37:40.157
I know you not talking
about my son's money.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.425
...for Brandus' CD...

37:41.492 --> 37:43.427
I know you didn't lie

37:43.494 --> 37:45.529
{\an1}and say you were
taking money for my son.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.132
{\an5}(Brandi)
My mom never took me
to the bank because--

37:48.199 --> 37:50.101
You took my son money...

37:50.167 --> 37:52.036
and you lied about where
the (bleep) you was going.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.571
Lied to Princess and Ray.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.039
Talking about you
shopping for dresses,

37:55.106 --> 37:57.975
and you doing (bleep).

37:58.042 --> 37:59.110
{\an3}Mm...

37:59.176 --> 38:00.444
B. been on my head
for months

38:00.511 --> 38:02.580
about letting her
control the savings

38:02.647 --> 38:04.548
'cause I spend money
too fast.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.985
So the fact that she would
go out, invest in a store,

38:08.052 --> 38:10.087
and not tell me
is some real foul (bleep),

38:10.154 --> 38:13.090
and it just goes to show
you can never trust nobody.

38:13.157 --> 38:15.459
{\an4}Come back in here,
don't leave in the middle
of the store--

38:15.526 --> 38:17.361
{\an5}I'll talk to you later.

38:15.526 --> 38:17.361
In the middle of the store!

38:17.428 --> 38:19.063
(Princess)
I feel for Brandi,

38:19.130 --> 38:20.498
but I honestly can't

38:20.564 --> 38:22.299
blame Max for being mad
right now.

38:22.366 --> 38:25.269
He's got 27,000 reasons
to be upset.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.837
Brandi might have thought
she was doing something good

38:26.904 --> 38:29.040
for the family,
but you just can't go

38:29.106 --> 38:31.075
and do those kind of things
by yourself.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.310
{\an4}Let me ask you a question:
When the (bleep) I ever
told you no?

38:33.377 --> 38:34.912
{\an5}No! It's not about--

38:33.377 --> 38:34.912
When I ever said no?

38:34.979 --> 38:36.280
{\an1}When the (bleep) have
I ever said no?

38:36.347 --> 38:37.648
So why would you spend
some money for my son

38:37.715 --> 38:39.250
{\an1}and not tell me what
the (bleep) you doing?

38:39.316 --> 38:40.251
Because I didn't
think you would--

38:40.317 --> 38:41.385
You sound stupid
right now.

38:41.452 --> 38:42.520
{\an5}I didn't wanna tell you--

38:41.452 --> 38:42.520
{\an3}All right.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.388
{\an1}I'm gonna pay you
all the money back!

38:44.455 --> 38:46.057
{\an5}I'm not done talking to you.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.057
No, I'm good.

38:46.123 --> 38:47.224
What is you doing?

38:47.291 --> 38:48.626
It's for our son.

38:48.693 --> 38:49.827
{\an1}No! No!

38:49.894 --> 38:51.762
(Max)
Don't do that.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.931
Don't-- get off my
mother(bleep) car.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.199
{\an4}You are not
going to leave me.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.199
{\an3}Really?

38:55.266 --> 38:56.667
You want me to go to jail
in Inglewood?

38:56.734 --> 38:58.703
{\an4}No!

38:56.734 --> 38:58.703
So get the (bleep)
off my car.

38:58.769 --> 38:59.904
Go, go, go, yeah.

38:59.970 --> 39:01.405
Go, go, go, go, go.

39:01.472 --> 39:02.773
Get the (bleep) off.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.942
I know he's upset,

39:05.009 --> 39:06.610
and I know he wants
to leave.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.479
I just need him to stay.

39:08.546 --> 39:11.882
It has to be explained that
that money

39:11.949 --> 39:14.518
is going to be
put back, and more.

39:14.585 --> 39:16.520
{\an5}No! No! No! No!

39:14.585 --> 39:16.520
(Max)
Dude...

39:16.587 --> 39:18.322
{\an5}I swear to God.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.322
No, no!

39:18.389 --> 39:22.259
No! No!
No, no, no!

39:22.326 --> 39:24.361
{\an5}(Brandi, sobbing)
I swear to God,
I swear to God,

39:24.428 --> 39:26.764
I don't want this
to end like this.

39:26.831 --> 39:28.532
(sobbing)

39:34.038 --> 39:35.673
{\an8}Next time, on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

39:35.740 --> 39:38.342
{\an8}(Brandi)
My intent was to impress you

39:38.409 --> 39:40.711
{\an8}and do something amazing
our our son.

39:40.778 --> 39:42.480
{\an8}(Max)
(bleep) the money--
at the end of the day,

39:42.546 --> 39:43.914
{\an8}it'll never really
be the same.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.916
{\an7}Like we was Bonnie and Clyde,
and now it's like--

39:45.983 --> 39:47.585
{\an7}(crying)
Don't sit up here and act like

39:47.651 --> 39:48.953
{\an8}I'm not worth it.

39:49.019 --> 39:52.223
{\an7}You come home
for me and the baby.

39:52.289 --> 39:53.858
{\an8}(woman)
Are you single?

39:53.924 --> 39:56.327
{\an8}I'm definitely looking,
because this coconut oil

39:56.393 --> 39:58.162
{\an8}can't put on by itself.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.331
{\an7}Seriously, you're like
the most beautiful person

40:00.397 --> 40:01.866
{\an8}I've ever met in my life.

40:01.932 --> 40:03.901
{\an8}That is so sweet of you.

40:03.968 --> 40:05.035
{\an8}♪♪

40:05.102 --> 40:06.137
{\an8}Do you think
there's a difference

40:06.203 --> 40:07.838
{\an8}between men
and women lovers?

40:07.905 --> 40:09.006
{\an7}What's the point
of having a (bleep)

40:09.073 --> 40:11.075
{\an7}if you can't use it
for the right reason?

40:12.710 --> 40:14.812
{\an7}I'm watching all these tweets
going back and forth

40:14.879 --> 40:16.046
{\an8}between you and Fetty.

40:16.113 --> 40:19.216
{\an7}So he asked if he could
come to the hospital.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.051
{\an7}Do you think
he's up to something?

40:21.118 --> 40:23.454
{\an7}So you're gonna be back
before the baby's born then?

40:23.521 --> 40:25.756
{\an8}Yeah, I wanna be the one
where she gets,

40:25.823 --> 40:27.091
{\an8}"Oh, there--
that's my daddy," yes.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.594
{\an8}(woman)
He's starting
to look like a deadbeat

40:30.661 --> 40:32.997
{\an8}before the baby's even here.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.966
{\an7}So have you started
looking for a place yet?

40:36.033 --> 40:37.268
{\an8}It's time to go.

40:37.334 --> 40:38.903
{\an8}You're gonna have to
realize that I'm here.

40:38.969 --> 40:41.772
{\an7}Our going back and forth
is going to lead to blows,
eventually, so--

40:41.839 --> 40:44.375
{\an8}All you gotta do is
pull my button one time.

40:44.441 --> 40:46.043
{\an8}(A1)
They don't like each other, bro.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.444
{\an8}Oh, mama beef.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.947
{\an7}Bro, it's so much
mama beef, it's crazy.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.650
{\an8}I toast Sister Pam finally
getting the hell out.

40:52.716 --> 40:55.352
{\an8}You in your own house-- you
ain't got nothing to do with me.

40:55.419 --> 40:56.754
{\an8}(bleep)!

40:56.821 --> 40:58.889
{\an7}You can't push us to be
something that we're not!

40:58.956 --> 41:00.724
{\an8}I do that-- I do that--

40:58.956 --> 41:00.724
{\an8}Stop! Stop!

41:00.791 --> 41:01.826
{\an9}Chill!
