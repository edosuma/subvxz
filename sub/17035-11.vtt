WEBVTT

00:07.213 --> 00:09.079
Why do we even have a landline anymore?

00:09.081 --> 00:11.749
Mm, they say you should
have one to call 911.

00:11.751 --> 00:13.149
At this point if anything happens,

00:13.151 --> 00:14.577
don't bother calling 911.

00:14.602 --> 00:16.309
I just want to go.

00:16.311 --> 00:18.989
Hi, this is Gail
from Happy Hoosier Homemakers,

00:18.991 --> 00:21.380
and I'm happy to say
this is your lucky day.

00:21.405 --> 00:24.527
- Hear that, Mike? It's our lucky day.
- and this month, it's you.

00:24.529 --> 00:25.962
We picked your business card
out of the fishbowl

00:25.964 --> 00:27.435
at Don's Oriental,

00:27.442 --> 00:28.676
- What a load of crap.
- and we're calling to schedule

00:28.678 --> 00:30.477
They tell you you put
a business card in a fishbowl,

00:30.479 --> 00:31.712
and... Wait, I did that.

00:31.714 --> 00:32.880
...when you get this message.

00:32.882 --> 00:34.682
You can reach us at...

00:34.684 --> 00:35.949
Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

00:35.951 --> 00:37.496
Yeah, this is Frankie Heck.

00:39.121 --> 00:40.547
You're kidding.

00:40.987 --> 00:42.222
What, seriously?

00:42.224 --> 00:44.457
Well, great! Thank you!

00:44.459 --> 00:47.294
T-Thank you so, so much!

00:48.597 --> 00:51.331
Oh, my God. This is life-changing.

00:51.908 --> 00:53.066
What'd we win?

00:53.068 --> 00:56.035
Free maid service
twice a week for a month.

00:56.242 --> 00:58.237
And I let myself get
a little bit excited.

00:58.239 --> 00:59.806
No, Mike, you don't get it.

00:59.808 --> 01:02.075
I have been fighting
a losing battle with this house

01:02.077 --> 01:05.044
since we moved in,
and now someone who is not me

01:05.046 --> 01:07.180
is gonna come in here and clean.

01:07.182 --> 01:09.582
I mean, our house
is gonna have a pine scent

01:09.584 --> 01:10.817
at the end of the day,

01:10.819 --> 01:13.385
and not from someone
spilling the bottle by accident.

01:13.387 --> 01:14.486
Yeah, we're not doing it.

01:14.488 --> 01:15.854
I don't like the idea of some stranger

01:15.856 --> 01:17.356
poking around in my stuff.

01:17.874 --> 01:20.992
You listen now and you listen good.

01:20.994 --> 01:24.062
I'll get rid of you
before I get rid of her.

01:24.064 --> 01:25.331
Fine.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.898
Just don't get anybody friendly.

01:30.871 --> 01:33.304
Okay, Bin people. Listen up.

01:33.306 --> 01:36.041
A room has opened up...

01:36.043 --> 01:38.877
for...

01:38.879 --> 01:40.178
Scott.

01:40.180 --> 01:41.546
Whoo-hoo!

01:41.548 --> 01:43.348
So long, suckers!

01:47.554 --> 01:49.220
I feel like we're puppies no one wants,

01:49.222 --> 01:51.556
and Sarah McLachlan should be
singing a song about us.

01:51.558 --> 01:54.125
This is ridiculous.
They said three months.

01:54.127 --> 01:55.993
It's gonna be spring,
and we're still trapped here.

01:55.995 --> 01:57.128
I know, right?

01:57.130 --> 01:59.130
Kind of makes you wish
you had any other options.

01:59.132 --> 02:01.666
I'm sorry, Sue. I just can't.

02:01.668 --> 02:02.667
Okay, look.

02:02.669 --> 02:03.968
I know you didn't want your dad

02:03.970 --> 02:05.502
to put us up at an awesome apartment

02:05.504 --> 02:07.537
because you wanted
the college experience,

02:07.539 --> 02:10.207
but I think we've had
the college experience.

02:10.209 --> 02:11.742
And the orphanage experience.

02:11.744 --> 02:13.778
And the prison experience.

02:13.780 --> 02:15.712
Sue, I know we'll get out of here,

02:15.714 --> 02:17.547
if we can just stick it out
a little longer.

02:17.549 --> 02:18.916
I'm building so much character.

02:18.918 --> 02:21.752
Look at me. I'm eating ramen
out of a Tupperware.

02:21.754 --> 02:24.120
You should come to my house.
You'd go nuts.

02:25.223 --> 02:27.424
I figured
if you're gonna have a maid,

02:27.426 --> 02:30.827
you got to have a good vacuum,
so I sent Mike to the place

02:30.829 --> 02:33.363
with the biggest inventory
at the best prices.

02:33.365 --> 02:34.164
Hello?

02:34.166 --> 02:36.432
Hello?

02:36.434 --> 02:38.334
Hello?

02:38.336 --> 02:39.669
Dad?

02:41.039 --> 02:42.371
Dad?

02:44.709 --> 02:46.375
What happened to you?

02:46.377 --> 02:48.444
Nothing happened.

02:48.784 --> 02:51.114
Well, something happened.
You're walking with a cane.

02:51.116 --> 02:52.648
I know how I'm walking.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.383
What... What do you want?

02:54.385 --> 02:56.051
Just came by to borrow a vacuum cleaner.

02:56.053 --> 03:00.289
Oh, I-I'm not sure I can
spare one at this juncture.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.791
You got 15.

03:01.793 --> 03:05.060
You counting my vacuum cleaners now?

03:05.062 --> 03:06.796
Are you sleeping down here?

03:06.798 --> 03:08.698
What are you, a cop?

03:08.700 --> 03:10.833
What's going on, Dad?
How long you been like this?

03:10.835 --> 03:12.100
Oh, a couple of weeks.

03:12.102 --> 03:14.536
I... I don't know, a month.

03:14.538 --> 03:18.807
I don't write everything down
in some kind of lady diary.

03:18.809 --> 03:20.309
Did you see a doctor?

03:20.311 --> 03:21.310
Oh, pfft.

03:21.312 --> 03:22.777
Look, Dad, this is nuts.

03:22.779 --> 03:25.214
Clearly, you can't drive.
How you getting to the grocery?

03:25.216 --> 03:26.381
Why didn't you call me?

03:26.383 --> 03:27.682
Or Rusty. Or me.

03:27.684 --> 03:29.684
I don't need a grocery.

03:29.686 --> 03:31.419
I got these gumballs. Eh.

03:32.989 --> 03:34.784
When I run out...

03:36.226 --> 03:38.159
I'll let you know.

03:40.831 --> 03:43.664
It was all my "Downton Abbey"
dreams come true.

03:43.666 --> 03:46.267
I was gonna relax
while my very own housemaid

03:46.269 --> 03:48.236
whipped this sorry house into shape.

03:50.506 --> 03:52.606
You guys got a lot of stairs.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.775
Oh. Well, hi.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.777
I'm Frankie. You can call me Frankie.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.246
You don't have to call me
Mrs. Heck or anything.

03:58.248 --> 03:59.680
I'm not fancy.

03:59.682 --> 04:00.547
Esther.

04:00.549 --> 04:02.716
Well. Come in. Come in.

04:02.718 --> 04:04.084
Your house isn't on the bus route.

04:04.086 --> 04:05.586
It's hard to get to.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.224 --> 04:44.657
Frankie!

04:44.659 --> 04:46.492
I'm in here.

04:48.186 --> 04:49.828
What are you doing in Sue's room?

04:49.830 --> 04:51.596
Hiding from the maid.

04:51.598 --> 04:52.831
Why? Is she friendly?

04:52.833 --> 04:55.267
No, I feel guilty. She's old, Mike.

04:55.269 --> 04:56.568
She should be retired.

04:56.570 --> 04:58.770
Clearly, she made some bad life choices.

04:58.772 --> 04:59.871
Worse than us?

04:59.873 --> 05:01.073
Time will tell.

05:01.075 --> 05:02.474
How's your dad?

05:02.476 --> 05:04.476
Bad.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.777
What do you mean "bad"?

05:05.779 --> 05:09.247
Well, he can barely walk now,
so he's using the cane.

05:09.249 --> 05:11.817
He's sleeping in his chair
'cause he can't get upstairs.

05:11.819 --> 05:14.085
Oh, my God! What happened?

05:14.087 --> 05:15.454
Whatever it is...

05:15.456 --> 05:17.255
What?

05:17.257 --> 05:19.123
Whatever it is,

05:19.125 --> 05:21.859
I think it might be time
to get him out of that house.

05:21.861 --> 05:23.894
So you think it's that serious?

05:23.896 --> 05:25.396
That place has always been a deathtrap,

05:25.398 --> 05:27.898
and the way he is now,
if something were to happen,

05:27.900 --> 05:29.434
I'm scared he can't get out.

05:29.436 --> 05:31.135
I'm so sorry!

05:31.137 --> 05:34.805
I know how hard it'd be
for your dad to move!

05:34.807 --> 05:37.842
Honestly, it's amazing
he's lived alone for this long.

05:37.844 --> 05:39.142
When my mom goes out of town,

05:39.144 --> 05:42.546
my dad has the paperboy
make him a grilled cheese.

05:42.548 --> 05:44.448
I got to talk to Rusty about this.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.857
I got this, Esther.

05:54.559 --> 05:56.526
Why don't you go lie down?

06:05.237 --> 06:07.302
Hutch, the tarp didn't hold!

06:07.839 --> 06:09.306
Gee, imagine that.

06:09.308 --> 06:11.007
Two of your flannel shirts tied together

06:11.009 --> 06:13.442
with rubber bands
and Scotch tape didn't hold.

06:13.643 --> 06:15.044
What kind of attitude
we gonna have today...

06:15.046 --> 06:16.646
a good one or a bad one?

06:16.909 --> 06:18.147
Oh!

06:18.149 --> 06:20.383
Crap! Kenny's gonna kill us for
getting snow on his computer.

06:20.385 --> 06:21.350
Aah!

06:21.352 --> 06:23.085
Kenny!

06:23.087 --> 06:25.187
Oh, he better be alive!

06:25.189 --> 06:27.223
We were gonna be
Donkey and Shrek next Halloween.

06:28.426 --> 06:29.758
Pffft!

06:29.760 --> 06:32.161
We can't live like this anymore.

06:32.163 --> 06:33.996
It's not like we got a lot of options.

06:38.202 --> 06:39.502
Sue!

06:39.504 --> 06:41.237
My favorite sister.

06:41.239 --> 06:43.639
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

06:46.911 --> 06:48.478
I'm telling you, he can barely walk.

06:49.592 --> 06:52.994
Man, to see such a strong man
like Dad laid so low.

06:53.590 --> 06:55.696
It's like an emotional
punch to the package.

06:55.698 --> 06:56.963
Oop!

07:00.868 --> 07:02.000
What's going on?

07:02.002 --> 07:03.835
- You Bryan?
- Yes.

07:03.837 --> 07:07.005
Well, I'm your driver... Juan.

07:07.007 --> 07:09.541
And this is my brother... Lancelot.

07:09.543 --> 07:12.510
I learned it's best when they
can't trace anything back to you.

07:12.512 --> 07:13.911
Now, where were we? Oh, right.

07:13.913 --> 07:15.713
Talking about our dying pop.

07:15.715 --> 07:17.248
Well, he's not dying.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.184
And I'm not talking about it
in front of Bryan.

07:19.186 --> 07:21.852
He's cool. He got four stars.

07:21.854 --> 07:25.890
Now, listen. I got something
that'll solve this whole deal.

07:25.892 --> 07:28.059
We send all the old people to war.

07:28.061 --> 07:30.061
We need somebody to fight the wars,

07:30.063 --> 07:32.129
and old people,
they need something to do.

07:32.131 --> 07:33.631
They're gonna die soon anyway.

07:33.633 --> 07:36.601
This way, they go out
with a real sense of purpose.

07:36.603 --> 07:37.568
Yeah.

07:37.570 --> 07:39.509
We're not sending Dad to war.

07:39.906 --> 07:41.205
Well, I don't see any other option.

07:41.207 --> 07:43.673
Really? You don't see any other option?

07:43.675 --> 07:46.876
Look, we'd all like to think
peace would work,

07:46.878 --> 07:49.513
but I don't see it
happening in our lifetime.

07:49.515 --> 07:51.215
He's just gonna
have to move in with you.

07:51.217 --> 07:53.550
He can't move in with me.
We don't have any room.

07:53.552 --> 07:55.352
Brick still has
three more years of high school,

07:55.354 --> 07:58.122
Sue's always there, and Axl's
about to graduate college,

07:58.124 --> 07:59.556
so you know he's coming back.

08:00.191 --> 08:02.391
Clearly, we're at an impasse.

08:02.393 --> 08:04.293
So there's only one logical thing to do.

08:04.295 --> 08:07.563
Bryan, you've been
awfully quiet back there.

08:07.565 --> 08:09.766
This affects you, too, you know.

08:09.768 --> 08:11.267
We're not letting a stranger decide

08:11.269 --> 08:13.003
what we do with our dad.

08:13.005 --> 08:14.771
You don't want to send Dad to war.

08:14.773 --> 08:16.772
You don't want to consult with Bryan.

08:16.774 --> 08:18.907
You're just like Mr. Negative.

08:18.909 --> 08:21.043
You... You know, my uncle
likes the place he's at...

08:21.045 --> 08:23.312
Twilight Estates Assisted Living.

08:23.314 --> 08:25.781
Food's decent, and they take Medicare.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.641
Oh, yeah?

08:28.119 --> 08:30.186
I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't
hurt to take a look.

08:30.188 --> 08:33.155
That is not how you break a tie, Bryan.

08:33.157 --> 08:35.057
That's a whole new idea.

08:35.058 --> 08:38.126
Now we're right back
to where we started.

08:38.129 --> 08:40.195
Don't mind Juan.

08:40.197 --> 08:43.126
So, lucky for me,
Happy Hoosiers was sending me

08:43.128 --> 08:45.390
a new free maid, which was pretty nice

08:45.415 --> 08:47.682
considering I broke the first one.

08:47.684 --> 08:50.117
Missus?
I need to show you something.

08:52.389 --> 08:53.988
This is very bad.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.624
Yeah, I know. It was like that
when we moved in.

08:56.626 --> 08:59.394
I scrub and I scrub,
but I can do nothing.

08:59.396 --> 09:01.496
You know what? Just forget it.

09:01.498 --> 09:03.564
I'll deal with it.

09:03.566 --> 09:06.867
Missus? I need to show you something.

09:10.106 --> 09:13.107
Food is old. Everything is rotten.

09:13.109 --> 09:14.408
Yeah, I know.

09:14.410 --> 09:16.143
It's not cold enough,
and the kids leave it open.

09:16.145 --> 09:18.578
You know what? Just leave it.
I'll take care of it.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.714
Missus, I need to show you some...

09:20.716 --> 09:22.216
I know, I know. Just show me.

09:23.719 --> 09:26.486
Oh! Oh! Here we go.

09:26.488 --> 09:27.788
Oh, get that weak sauce out of here!

09:27.790 --> 09:28.655
Okay.

09:28.657 --> 09:30.390
You guys need to be quiet.

09:30.392 --> 09:32.692
We are so close
to getting our forever room,

09:32.694 --> 09:34.895
but if they catch you here,
they'll throw us out.

09:34.897 --> 09:36.863
And I really want my forever room!

09:36.865 --> 09:38.364
Relax. No one will know we're here.

09:38.366 --> 09:40.333
We are shadow. We are wind.

09:41.436 --> 09:42.768
Listen to me.

09:42.770 --> 09:45.838
There is an R.A. here... Dan.
He's very by-the-book.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.206
I always thought I was by-the-book,

09:47.208 --> 09:48.441
because of my fear of authority

09:48.443 --> 09:49.775
and sense of social responsibility,

09:49.777 --> 09:51.377
but this guy takes the cake.

09:51.379 --> 09:52.778
He actually took a guy's cake,

09:52.780 --> 09:54.713
because there is no joy
allowed in the Bin.

09:54.715 --> 09:55.381
Juh!

09:55.383 --> 09:56.749
Oh.

09:56.751 --> 09:58.116
White men can jump!

09:58.118 --> 09:59.151
Ooh!

10:00.888 --> 10:02.755
You know, when I look at you,
I don't see color.

10:02.757 --> 10:04.657
I just see a truly sucky
basketball player.

10:04.659 --> 10:07.493
Well, I'm sorry, but it's
impossible to concentrate

10:07.495 --> 10:10.362
when Lexie's undressing me
with her eyes over here.

10:10.364 --> 10:11.730
Mm.

10:11.732 --> 10:13.198
Tell me, Axl,

10:13.200 --> 10:16.801
what is it exactly that you
think makes you so irresistible?

10:16.803 --> 10:19.504
Is it that you live in your truck?

10:19.506 --> 10:22.007
Is it that you share
a toothbrush with Hutch?

10:22.009 --> 10:23.008
I'm orange.

10:23.010 --> 10:24.476
I'm orange.

10:24.478 --> 10:26.445
You're right. You're right, Axl.

10:26.447 --> 10:28.347
I am undressing you.

10:28.349 --> 10:31.749
I am fantasizing about you
taking your shirt off,

10:31.751 --> 10:34.886
and then your pants,
and then your underwear...

10:34.888 --> 10:37.154
Mm. which you also share with Hutch.

10:37.647 --> 10:38.590
I'm orange.

10:38.592 --> 10:39.991
I'm orange!

10:39.993 --> 10:40.959
What? Okay.

10:40.961 --> 10:42.861
Look, Lexie, I get it.

10:42.863 --> 10:45.129
I'm a divorcé,
which makes you want me more

10:45.131 --> 10:47.131
'cause you think you can fix me
where other women couldn't.

10:47.133 --> 10:50.501
But I am still dating my
ex-wife, so you need to move on.

10:50.503 --> 10:53.270
This is why they invented libraries.

10:53.272 --> 10:55.106
Oh, is that why they invented libraries?

10:59.078 --> 11:01.212
R.A. in the hall!

11:01.214 --> 11:03.079
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:03.081 --> 11:05.248
I told you guys you were being too loud.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.517
Now we are gonna get caught,

11:06.519 --> 11:08.018
and I'll get kicked out of school,

11:08.020 --> 11:10.320
and it'll be a black mark
on my permanent record for life.

11:10.322 --> 11:11.922
What if I want to run
for office someday?!

11:11.924 --> 11:13.624
Just shut up and read a book, dummy!

11:25.203 --> 11:27.303
Ha ha!

11:33.878 --> 11:34.978
Yeah.

11:36.048 --> 11:38.081
Mom, seriously?

11:38.083 --> 11:40.883
Look what the cleaning lady
did to my new, dark-wash,

11:40.885 --> 11:42.953
not-from-the-cousin-box jeans.

11:42.955 --> 11:44.620
It's hard to get good help, Brick.

11:44.622 --> 11:46.489
We never knew that
'cause we never had help,

11:46.491 --> 11:47.991
but whenever I read about rich people,

11:47.993 --> 11:49.692
they always said
it was hard to get good help,

11:49.694 --> 11:51.126
and they were right.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.197
I liked it better
when you washed my clothes

11:55.199 --> 11:56.999
and everything was still a little damp

11:57.001 --> 11:58.200
and it smelled weird

11:58.202 --> 12:00.770
and it was balled up in Sue's drawer.

12:00.772 --> 12:03.072
We got a new one coming.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.543
Can I help you?

12:08.545 --> 12:10.045
Hi! I'm April.

12:10.047 --> 12:12.147
I'm looking for temporary housing.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.515
My ex-husband is staying there.

12:13.517 --> 12:15.484
It's totally against the rules,

12:15.486 --> 12:16.585
so I'm supposed to keep a lookout

12:16.587 --> 12:19.321
for some jerky R.A. named Dan.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.555
I'm Dan.

12:26.697 --> 12:28.897
Ah ha ha!

12:28.899 --> 12:30.732
Welcome, ladies.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.367
I know I speak for Hutch and Kenny

12:32.369 --> 12:35.303
when I say mi 'Bago es su 'Bago.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.606
I told you we were gonna get thrown out,

12:38.608 --> 12:39.840
but you didn't listen,

12:39.842 --> 12:42.576
because you always play
everything so fast and loose!

12:42.578 --> 12:45.013
Look, Sue... did you a favor.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.680
You said the Bin was
the worst place you ever lived.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.949
Well, booyah! Totally listened.

12:48.951 --> 12:50.251
So I think the words you're looking for

12:50.253 --> 12:52.220
are "Thank you, Axl."

12:52.222 --> 12:54.055
Oh, I think the word
I'm looking for is...

12:55.491 --> 12:57.224
Babe, it might
be a little icy in here,

12:57.226 --> 12:59.059
so watch your step.

12:59.061 --> 13:01.829
Dad, Rusty and I want
to talk to you about something.

13:01.831 --> 13:03.764
This place is a lot to take care of,

13:03.766 --> 13:05.465
and you're having a tough time
moving around now.

13:05.467 --> 13:08.235
I can't help but notice
you're running low on gumballs.

13:08.237 --> 13:10.771
So me and Rusty checked out
this great place called...

13:10.773 --> 13:11.938
No!

13:11.940 --> 13:13.306
Well, that's that, then.

13:13.308 --> 13:15.342
What? No! It's not that.

13:15.344 --> 13:16.543
Well, I don't know, Mike.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.778
Dad's making a lot of good points.

13:18.780 --> 13:19.879
He said, "No."

13:19.881 --> 13:21.681
You can't argue with that.

13:21.683 --> 13:24.384
Yeah, you can! That's part
of the plan, remember?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.786
I said, "Dad's not
gonna take this well."

13:26.788 --> 13:28.555
United front. You're supposed to
have my back on this.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.689
Oh, yeah?

13:29.691 --> 13:31.024
Well, you were supposed to have my back

13:31.026 --> 13:34.226
the time I stole the lawnmower
and drove to the Dairy Queen,

13:34.228 --> 13:37.030
but you squealed to Mom
like a little girl.

13:37.032 --> 13:38.631
That was 40 years ago.

13:38.633 --> 13:39.432
Yeah?

13:39.434 --> 13:40.533
Well, it's like they say...

13:40.535 --> 13:42.835
"Vengeance is a dish best served

13:42.837 --> 13:44.503
after a really long time."

13:45.506 --> 13:48.369
I am not going to a nursing home.

13:48.709 --> 13:52.010
Meebles Department Store
is going out of business.

13:52.012 --> 13:56.449
I'm gonna try and get
their jewelry display cases.

13:56.451 --> 13:58.284
What... What does that
have to do with anything?

13:58.286 --> 14:00.419
You can get good money
out of selling them.

14:00.421 --> 14:03.154
Yeah. But that's the thing,
Dad... You don't.

14:03.156 --> 14:05.557
You just keep stuff
and you hoard and hoard.

14:05.559 --> 14:07.626
And now this place is one spark away

14:07.628 --> 14:09.527
from turning into a pile of ashes.

14:09.529 --> 14:11.797
And you couldn't walk
out of here if you wanted to.

14:11.799 --> 14:13.481
Look, you're going someplace

14:13.483 --> 14:14.600
where they're gonna take care of you,

14:14.602 --> 14:15.834
whether you like it or not.

14:15.836 --> 14:17.241
And that's the end of the story.

14:17.704 --> 14:20.138
Well, Mike's also the one
that put the two fingers

14:20.140 --> 14:21.706
in your birthday cake that time.

14:21.708 --> 14:23.356
Do you want me to go
cut a switch for you, Dad?

14:33.052 --> 14:35.019
I'll give you half if you
don't tell Sue I have Fluff.

14:35.021 --> 14:36.320
She's like a jackal.

14:36.322 --> 14:38.589
Sue's my best friend.
And I think that's selfish.

14:38.591 --> 14:39.957
But I'm starving, so hand it over.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.793
Mm.

14:42.795 --> 14:44.750
You are not subtle.

14:45.498 --> 14:47.161
What are you talking about?

14:48.067 --> 14:49.834
You just happen to be up when I'm up?

14:49.836 --> 14:51.935
It's obvious you've been
tracking my snack schedule

14:51.937 --> 14:53.504
over the past couple days.

14:53.506 --> 14:55.139
How can you live in such a small place

14:55.141 --> 14:56.873
with such a huge ego?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.108
Got a hole in the roof.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.372
Okay.

14:59.911 --> 15:01.945
I'm gonna say this real slow,

15:01.947 --> 15:03.780
because I think that will help you.

15:03.782 --> 15:06.883
I... do... not... like... you.

15:06.885 --> 15:10.153
I don't think about you.
I don't look at you.

15:10.155 --> 15:12.956
I want to get as far away
from you as possible because...

15:12.958 --> 15:14.124
Oh!

15:18.764 --> 15:19.696
Uh...

15:19.698 --> 15:21.765
Next time, just let me fall.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.198
What are you doing?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.267
I'm just ready to get out of here.

15:41.269 --> 15:42.536
What? Why?

15:42.538 --> 15:45.006
It's just too close, too tight quarters.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.966
I hope you're not mad, but I told my dad

15:46.968 --> 15:49.535
we want the apartment
at The Villas at Gumford Falls.

15:49.537 --> 15:50.503
You did?

15:50.505 --> 15:52.572
W-Wait. Oh, is the "We" me?

15:52.574 --> 15:53.740
Are we "We"?

15:53.742 --> 15:54.974
Of course.

15:54.976 --> 15:57.109
But it's got a doorman,
a gym, and a hot tub,

15:57.111 --> 15:59.111
so it won't be the college experience.

15:59.113 --> 16:00.615
I hope you don't mind.

16:01.149 --> 16:02.614
Can I just say...

16:02.616 --> 16:05.251
I am the happiest I have ever been.

16:05.253 --> 16:07.319
I didn't know there were jets
just for your feet.

16:07.321 --> 16:09.789
Not just for your feet. Ahh! Mm!

16:09.791 --> 16:12.056
Okay, seriously, you guys.
We said half an hour.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.558
Your time is up.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.959
I'd go, but I can't leave

16:14.961 --> 16:17.829
until the concierge
finishes polishing my shoes.

16:23.304 --> 16:24.969
What happened here?

16:24.971 --> 16:27.372
The new maid with the face tattoo came

16:27.374 --> 16:29.107
and pulled out all
the appliances to clean them

16:29.109 --> 16:31.242
and then mumbled something about
life being too short and left.

16:32.913 --> 16:35.046
Uh, I-I wouldn't go back there, Mom.

16:35.048 --> 16:36.480
It's a hamster killing field.

16:37.650 --> 16:39.250
I don't get it...
We've been living like this

16:39.252 --> 16:41.019
ever since the Fergusons returned me.

16:41.021 --> 16:43.254
Why do you suddenly care so much?

16:44.791 --> 16:46.324
Because, Brick...

16:46.326 --> 16:48.926
You think I like having a messy house?

16:48.928 --> 16:51.462
You think I feel good
about what this says about me?

16:51.464 --> 16:54.732
I want to be one of those
people who have spoon caddies,

16:54.734 --> 16:58.536
where all the spoons are stacked
up like little spoon soldiers.

16:58.538 --> 17:00.638
Guess where my spoons are.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.540
Oh, look. Here's one.

17:03.542 --> 17:05.242
Propping up the microwave.

17:05.243 --> 17:08.278
Here's another one...
still in the yogurt.

17:09.748 --> 17:12.049
I'm only one cleaning person away

17:12.050 --> 17:14.050
from a whole different life, Brick.

17:14.053 --> 17:17.829
If I give up, then this is who I am.

17:18.122 --> 17:23.199
But as long as I'm trying
there's still hope.

17:23.595 --> 17:25.595
I get it.

17:25.597 --> 17:28.498
Well, let me help by taking care
of my dirty plate.

17:37.512 --> 17:39.108
Found another one.

17:41.479 --> 17:42.678
Hey, Mike!

17:42.680 --> 17:44.146
We got your mail again.

17:44.148 --> 17:45.882
I don't trust our new postman.

17:45.884 --> 17:48.918
He has that chin
hair, like a jazz musician.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.619
I'll keep an eye on him.

17:50.621 --> 17:53.121
I ran into Rusty
when he was over at your house.

17:53.123 --> 17:55.491
He said your dad's
having some health problems?

17:55.493 --> 17:57.626
Yeah. He's on a cane now.

17:57.628 --> 17:59.461
We're trying to move him
into a place, but...

17:59.463 --> 18:01.764
he's being a real
pain in the butt about it.

18:01.766 --> 18:03.064
Ugh! So sorry.

18:03.066 --> 18:04.966
I went through the same thing
with my dad.

18:04.968 --> 18:06.368
He just refused to admit

18:06.370 --> 18:08.210
that he couldn't take care of himself.

18:08.571 --> 18:10.605
We fought like cats and dogs
toward the end,

18:10.607 --> 18:13.095
but now that he's gone...

18:13.576 --> 18:16.544
I'd pay a million dollars
to have him back just one day.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.052
Dad can live with me.

18:26.222 --> 18:27.455
What?

18:27.457 --> 18:28.989
I just got to clear out
one of the kids' rooms

18:28.991 --> 18:30.674
and figure out a way to get him...

18:30.676 --> 18:32.894
Good! You're here.

18:32.896 --> 18:37.498
Now the both of you can help me
stack my new load of microwaves.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.166
Dad, what's going on? Where's the cane?

18:39.168 --> 18:41.601
Oh, well, I don't need it anymore.

18:41.603 --> 18:42.736
Dad's all better now.

18:42.738 --> 18:43.537
Yeah.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.005
He pooped!

18:45.741 --> 18:46.640
You what?

18:46.642 --> 18:48.442
Yeah, the darndest thing

18:48.444 --> 18:51.111
is something was gumming up the works.

18:51.113 --> 18:54.348
So don't go eyeballing my microwaves.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.150
I've still got a few miles left on me.

18:57.152 --> 18:58.913
So, you're perfectly fine?

18:58.915 --> 19:00.286
You went to the john,
and now you have no trouble

19:00.288 --> 19:01.254
walking at all?

19:01.256 --> 19:02.689
Feel better than ever.

19:03.859 --> 19:05.124
Just like I told you, son.

19:05.126 --> 19:07.594
You don't have to worry about me.

19:07.596 --> 19:10.430
When the time comes,
I'll just walk out into the woods,

19:10.432 --> 19:12.933
lie down, and die.

19:12.935 --> 19:14.733
- Hey, Dad.
- Hmm?

19:14.735 --> 19:16.769
You ever think of going to war?

19:27.097 --> 19:28.281
Brick, did you...?

19:28.283 --> 19:29.905
Oh, no. Of course not.

19:30.618 --> 19:33.018
Hi! You must be Frankie. I'm Colleen.

19:33.020 --> 19:35.087
I waxed the floors,
cleaned the refrigerator,

19:35.089 --> 19:36.404
reorganized your spice rack,

19:36.406 --> 19:37.620
and steam-cleaned the carpets.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.424
I know my time is up,
but if it's okay with you,

19:39.426 --> 19:41.694
I really want to finish getting
that ring out of the tub.

19:49.135 --> 19:50.601
Hello?

19:50.603 --> 19:53.570
Hi, Frankie. It's Gail
from Happy Hoosier Homemakers.

19:53.572 --> 19:55.973
I was just calling to see
how Colleen was working out.

19:55.975 --> 19:58.775
I love her
with all my heart, Gail.

19:58.777 --> 20:00.478
She's like the daughter I never had.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.513
I mean, I have a daughter,
but Colleen's better.

20:02.515 --> 20:04.248
That's fantastic.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.282
Well, this was your last free cleaning,

20:06.284 --> 20:10.120
so would you like to continue
with Colleen for $350 a month?

20:10.122 --> 20:12.155
I would, Gail.

20:12.157 --> 20:14.825
I really, really would.

20:14.827 --> 20:16.426
But I can't.

20:16.428 --> 20:18.428
Wait, do you know how much kidneys
are going for these days?

20:18.430 --> 20:20.096
I'm just kidding!

20:20.098 --> 20:23.233
Hey, before you go, Gail...
Are you only in Don's Oriental,

20:23.235 --> 20:25.868
or are you in any other
fishbowls around town?

20:25.870 --> 20:28.104
I'm sorry. You can't win twice.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.677
That's truer
than you know, Gail.

20:34.679 --> 20:36.846
I guess when it comes down to it,

20:36.848 --> 20:38.915
home isn't about how clean it is

20:38.917 --> 20:41.017
or knowing where your spoons are.

20:41.019 --> 20:44.186
It's where you make memories.

20:44.188 --> 20:47.056
It's where you get through
hard times together.

20:49.827 --> 20:51.761
It's where you're comfortable.

20:56.233 --> 21:01.270
But if you ask me,
it all boils down to this...

21:01.272 --> 21:03.505
Home is where the crap is.
