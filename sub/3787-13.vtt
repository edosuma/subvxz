00:01.702 --> 00:06.805
Welcome to the Williamsburg
Diner Awards Night!

00:06.807 --> 00:10.709
And here's your host,
Neil Patrick Hairless!

00:10.711 --> 00:13.212
This is the night
where everyone is recognized

00:13.214 --> 00:16.215
for their, well...
let's call it work.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.950
Nice suit, Han.

00:17.952 --> 00:20.486
I loved you in<i> The Penguins</i>
<i>of Madagascar.</i>

00:20.488 --> 00:22.988
Here we go.
The award for

00:22.990 --> 00:25.891
Worst Excuse for Being
Late to Work goes to...

00:25.893 --> 00:29.795
Earl, for:
"I died."

00:29.797 --> 00:31.296
It<i> was</i> true.

00:31.298 --> 00:35.401
I was dead
for a full 60 seconds.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.870
And the Foreign Film Award
goes to...

00:37.872 --> 00:41.840
Oleg, for always being
covered in a foreign film.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.177
Yeah. I have so many
bacteria to thank...

00:45.179 --> 00:48.914
but a special shout-out
to streptococcus!

00:48.916 --> 00:51.817
And the winner for Best Lie
Told to Get a Bigger Tip

00:51.819 --> 00:53.085
goes to...

00:53.087 --> 00:54.753
Good luck, girl.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.523
It's an honor to share
this category with you.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.726
It's Max...
for showing customers pictures

01:00.728 --> 01:03.829
of her three small children
on a regular basis.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.731
Wow. Oh!

01:05.733 --> 01:08.300
This award is dedicated
to the lights of my life--

01:08.302 --> 01:10.302
Maxine, Max Jr.,

01:10.304 --> 01:13.072
and Maxi-Pad.

01:13.074 --> 01:16.308
I know only one of you
can see and hear me,

01:16.310 --> 01:21.280
so please tell the others
I...love...you.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.418
And the award for
Best Waitress goes to...

01:26.420 --> 01:27.419
It better not!

01:27.421 --> 01:29.955
Caroline!
- No!

01:31.625 --> 01:34.026
Well, I guess it's true--
women only win awards

01:34.028 --> 01:36.995
when they take on roles
that are humiliating.

01:36.997 --> 01:40.766
And the Best Animated Short
goes to Han Lee!

01:49.677 --> 01:51.276

Ooh Ooh ¶

02:02.356 --> 02:03.722
Here's your menu.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.090
I'll be right back
with your water

02:05.092 --> 02:06.191
and a stomach pump.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.360
Keep it.
I know what I want.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.862
Me too.
But it just seems like

02:09.864 --> 02:13.198
Taylor Swift
is never going away.

02:15.603 --> 02:19.037
You're funny. Yeah.
I'm not in the mood for funny.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.308
I will take tomato soup,
house salad,

02:23.310 --> 02:27.146
extra croutons.
And you can charge me extra...

02:27.148 --> 02:29.815
if you have no heart
behind those gazongas.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.885
It's cool.
The guy at the counter

02:32.887 --> 02:35.487
has no teeth,
so you can have his.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.624
Less funny--more salad.
Right?

02:38.626 --> 02:41.326
Maybe the blonde one
should bring it.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.162
Oh, you want her
to bring it?

02:43.164 --> 02:45.564
Maybe clear your calendar.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.900
Uh, the lady in the booth
doesn't like my attitude

02:47.902 --> 02:50.435
and wants you,
so I guess what I'm saying is

02:50.437 --> 02:52.738
I still got it!

02:52.740 --> 02:56.341
Wait, a customer asked for me
and didn't follow it with,

02:56.343 --> 02:58.443
"I'd also like to see
the manager"?

02:58.445 --> 02:59.912
That's a first for me!

02:59.914 --> 03:02.014
Yo, blondie!

03:02.016 --> 03:03.248
Croutons!

03:04.251 --> 03:05.484
[ding ding]

03:05.486 --> 03:07.653
Pick up.
Tomato soup, house salad.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.557
And I'm also running
a special on D batteries.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.525
Buy both, and I'll thrown in
this bootleg copy

03:13.527 --> 03:15.894
of<i> Horrible Bosses II.</i>

03:17.331 --> 03:20.165
Here comes
Horrible Bosses Too Small.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.037
Need some new batteries
to keep walking and talking?

03:25.039 --> 03:29.541
No, Max, I'm not powered
by double Ds like you.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.350
Preach.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.786
Don't buy batteries
from that guy

03:40.788 --> 03:44.022
unless you want your heart
to stop on the bus.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.860
Oleg, this is supposed
to have extra croutons.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.128
It's for my regular.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.698
Yeah, you heard me.
It happened.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.033
Oh, no, "Extra Croutons"
is here again?

03:55.035 --> 03:57.069
Make sure you charge her
extra.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.871
I'm not made of stale bread!

03:59.873 --> 04:02.140
No, you're made of
Legos, right?

04:02.142 --> 04:03.875
We are not charging her extra.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.677
She looks like
she can't afford it.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.046
If she could,
why would she be eating here?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.681
Well, don't judge
a book by its cover.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.617
People look at me and--
Think you're bad in bed?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.218
What's your point?

04:13.220 --> 04:16.121
For your information, Max,
I'm not bad in bed.

04:16.123 --> 04:20.125
In fact, I'm quite the stud
in my Sims community.

04:20.127 --> 04:24.196
You wouldn't be a stud
in a retirement community.

04:24.198 --> 04:26.331
[bell dings]

04:26.333 --> 04:29.001
Hi!
Here's your salad...

04:29.003 --> 04:31.503
Uh...five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.405
Uh, continue.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.140
And I wanted to introduce
myself.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.908
I'm Caroline,
you're regular waitress.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.343
Ah.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.846
Oh! My turn.
Sorry.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.482
I live alone,
and my plants aren't this needy.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.083
I'm Nola.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.486
And this is Max.
Max, this is Nola.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.087
'Sup, Lola?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.489
It's Nola.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.091
See, this is why
I like the blonde one.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.926
She listens.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.262
May I please have
a cheesecake?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.730
Sure. And thank you, Nola.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.066
I think it's important
to listen to people.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.468
Coming right back
with that cherry pie.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.407
I'll tell her if she
ever stops listening.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.244
I think Nola knows
I'm more than just a waitress.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.279
She can see
right through this uniform.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.349
And so can I...
in just the right light.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.453
Close the door!
- Oh, my God!

05:21.455 --> 05:22.621
Sophie, you scared me!

05:22.623 --> 05:24.256
You're scared?

05:24.258 --> 05:27.659
I just saw the expiration
date on this milk!

05:27.661 --> 05:29.094
Come on, close it,
quick!

05:29.096 --> 05:31.330
I'm in here hiding
from Oleg.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.964
If you wanna get away
from Oleg,

05:32.966 --> 05:35.834
just go anywhere
they sell floss.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.370
I think that Oleg
is cheating on me.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.671
Look.
- <i>Oh, God!</i>

05:39.673 --> 05:42.207
Now she's gonna start
whipping it out?

05:42.209 --> 05:43.675
Look...

05:43.677 --> 05:46.178
He has a second
secret phone.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.547
It's a boner phone.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.849
You mean a burner phone.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.451
Same thing.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.885
Sophie, how do you know

05:53.887 --> 05:55.387
he just doesn't use it
for long distance or...

05:55.389 --> 05:58.056
Or for the woman
that I'm calling right now?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.058
Oh, put her on speaker.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.195
I've nothing else to do.
I'm at work.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.597
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Da? Oleg?</i>

06:05.599 --> 06:08.400
[grunts hoarsely]
Uh...ah...

06:13.140 --> 06:15.907
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Oleg?</i>

06:15.909 --> 06:18.910
[hoarsely]
Uhh...ah!

06:18.912 --> 06:23.382
That...
is a terrible Oleg.

06:23.384 --> 06:26.318
He is not that articulate.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.388
[woman speaking in Russian]

06:29.390 --> 06:33.325
Hah! That old whore!

06:33.327 --> 06:35.560
What did she say?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.096
I have no idea!

06:38.098 --> 06:39.798
I don't speak Russian,
but...

06:39.800 --> 06:42.901
I do speak "old whore."

06:42.903 --> 06:45.604
Tell me,
what is his problem?

06:45.606 --> 06:49.174
He has a sweet,
young filly like me at home

06:49.176 --> 06:51.810
and he needs to go out
and plow

06:51.812 --> 06:55.080
some old Russian field?

06:57.351 --> 07:00.852
Well...I'd ask what
you three are doing in here,

07:00.854 --> 07:02.487
but it's never gonna top

07:02.489 --> 07:05.090
what I'm imagining
you're doing in here.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.898
I can't believe
Nola didn't come in tonight.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.667
This is exactly what happened
with my Starbucks barista guy.

07:15.669 --> 07:19.070
One minute, he's suggestively
arranging the bananas at me,

07:19.072 --> 07:21.506
and then next minute,
he's face-down,

07:21.508 --> 07:23.608
dead in a puddle
of soy milk.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.744
Max, what if something
happened to her?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.879
More croutons for us!

07:27.881 --> 07:30.115
She said, "I'll see you
tomorrow."

07:30.117 --> 07:32.517
That doesn't mean anything.
It's just an expression

07:32.519 --> 07:35.921
like, "Employees
must wash hands."

07:35.923 --> 07:40.559
Or...
or, "The baby is yours."

07:40.561 --> 07:42.561
Hey, everybody!

07:44.631 --> 07:46.965
Oh, Sophie,
it's just you.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.967
You're poor!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.569
And now we're even.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.771
Look, I stole it again.
Where's Oleg?

07:52.773 --> 07:54.372
I'll tell you
where he's not--

07:54.374 --> 07:56.341
Culinary school.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.809
He's on break.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.012
Oh, she's gonna be sorry!

08:01.014 --> 08:04.683
Oh...no one comes between
Sophie and her man.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.652
You know...unless
we pay them to.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.556
Couple things--

08:11.558 --> 08:14.960
A--does anyone
ever work here?

08:14.962 --> 08:18.029
Caroline, stop worrying.
Extra Croutons is fine.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.399
She just called to order
some diner food to be delivered.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.070
Oh! So she wants to die
at home.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.372
I said we don't do deliveries.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.374
I told her you two
can barely get the food

08:29.376 --> 08:32.077
from the window
to the tables!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.850
Max, I had to stop by

08:38.852 --> 08:40.819
and bring Nola her salad
and croutons.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.321
I mean, she's kind of
my biggest fan right now.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.324
True...'cause you just
lost me.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.560
I know you think
this is crazy,

08:48.562 --> 08:50.996
but there's something about
the way Nola looks at me.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.098
It's like she's seeing
something in me.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.634
The woman wears
two pairs of glasses.

08:55.636 --> 08:59.070
To her, you're just a chatty
yellow and orange blur.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.507
I was told
you didn't deliver.

09:02.509 --> 09:05.644
By who,
her old boyfriends?

09:05.646 --> 09:08.446
Are you two
gonna kill me or something?

09:08.448 --> 09:10.148
Because if you are,

09:10.150 --> 09:13.184
I would like to put on
a different hat.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.920
No, no, no.
She got worried.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.688
See, you're her first
regular.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.490
I'm just here
for the story.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.592
I figured there'd be something
freaky behind this door

09:20.594 --> 09:24.362
like a 50-foot python
and what's left of the UPS guy.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.531
And Earl guessed
you were a man.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.166
No man.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.937
No, just me in here with
my vagina and my photographs.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.772
Oh! You're a photographer?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.273
I love photography!

09:35.275 --> 09:37.042
And I love privacy.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.677
And I love pot.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.046
Oh, I thought
we were going around.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.315
Come on.
You better come in too.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.951
You're the Yin
to her Yap.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.452
Hey, careful
where you step.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.021
I can't find
my third pair of glasses.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.991
It's on top of your hat.
No, that's my fourth pair.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.893
Hey!

09:54.895 --> 09:56.695
This is Billy the bum!

09:56.697 --> 09:59.331
He used to live in a box around
the corner from my apartment.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.899
He even let me stay over once

10:00.901 --> 10:02.634
when I had to get away
from this bad roommate.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.370
Oh, the one before me?
No, it was you.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.239
You two are a riot
together.

10:08.241 --> 10:12.377
You remind me of me
and my old photographer friend

10:12.379 --> 10:13.812
Annie Leibovitz.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.213
Course,
this was before...

10:15.215 --> 10:16.848
Before she got famous?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.150
No.
Before she hit on me.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.987
I told her
I wasn't into girls.

10:21.989 --> 10:25.357
But...I think she was
confused by the derby.

10:25.359 --> 10:28.193
Yeah. I think we're all
a little confused by it.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.329
Nola, I want to ask you
if you've ever had any success,

10:31.331 --> 10:33.932
but I don't know how to
do that without insulting you.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.501
That's correct.
You don't.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.407
Oh! You're having
a gallery show in SoHo?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.209
Good-bye.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.011
Uh, it was nice
of you two

10:46.013 --> 10:48.346
to, uh, come over,
check on me.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.715
Uh...weird, but nice.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.251
Perhaps we could come
to the opening.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.620
Oh. Oh, you don't
need to do that.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.322
I know we don't need to,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.591
but maybe I want to support
you and your amazing work.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.326
And Max would enjoy.
the free wine.
- Yes, I would.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.327
[laughs]
No.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.162
Oh, I would.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.365
No as in, "No, don't come."

11:07.367 --> 11:09.034
Now,
if you'll excuse me,

11:09.036 --> 11:10.635
I wanna eat my croutons

11:10.637 --> 11:12.837
without the vaudeville
stylings

11:12.839 --> 11:14.706
of Shecky and Nosy.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.046
Here.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.782
Oh, yeah, good.
I was looking for this.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.258
I can't believe
you're doing all this

11:33.260 --> 11:34.759
for a diner regular.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.828
I haven't seen you
this desperate since Monday,

11:36.830 --> 11:39.998
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.667
I know--on the weekends,
I just give up.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.969
Look that title!

11:44.971 --> 11:46.671
"The Great Unwashed."

11:46.673 --> 11:49.541
Are Oleg's balls here?

11:51.778 --> 11:54.546
Max, it's the "art scene."

11:54.548 --> 11:57.282
Class it up.
At least say testicles.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.017
Evening, ladies.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.885
<i>Earl, what are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>

12:00.887 --> 12:05.190
And, Han, your sweater's
eating your head.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.058
I'm here for the champagne

12:07.060 --> 12:11.563
and because I couldn't
find my way out.

12:11.565 --> 12:16.201
I just walked into
a picture of a door.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.971
Some of these are going
for thousands of dollars!

12:19.973 --> 12:22.040
That Nola bitch is rich,
and I bet she has

12:22.042 --> 12:25.944
a frigging summer house
made out of my free croutons!

12:25.946 --> 12:30.415
Han, it's the art scene.
Class it up.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.652
At least say "freaking."
Also, "testicles."

12:34.654 --> 12:37.622
Well, I'm not wasting
this new turtleneck on you two.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.390
I'm going to go mingle.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.760
A high fashion model
was giving me the eye.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.162
Then she'd have to be
high.

12:44.164 --> 12:48.266
Uh, Han, I believe
I'll stay here.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.468
Nobody wins with a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle

12:50.470 --> 12:52.370
as a wingman.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.740
Oh, hey, everybody.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.175
<i>Hey, Sophie.</i>
<i>Hey, Oleg.</i>

12:57.177 --> 13:00.345
So can I class it
back down now?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.747
Sorry we're late.
I was just over there

13:02.749 --> 13:06.484
admiring the photo of the happy
couple under the bridge.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.887
Happy couple?
Sophie, they're two junkies

13:08.889 --> 13:11.055
sharing a needle.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.757
Yeah, well,

13:12.759 --> 13:16.494
at least the lady junkie
knows where his needle's been.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.763
I don't even think
she knows her name.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.032
Well, she knows more
than she's letting on.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.201
She knows everything.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.204
Hey, you guys have
been here a while.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.273
Where's the best place
to steal some food?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.908
Max!
- Sorry, sorry.

13:29.910 --> 13:34.045
Classing it up:
Testicles some food?

13:34.047 --> 13:37.215
Oh, Max, I can tell
by your sassy demeanor

13:37.217 --> 13:39.684
you haven't seen
your photo yet.

13:39.686 --> 13:43.755
What photo? I haven't
bounced any checks here.

13:45.759 --> 13:48.793
Yep, that's me, all right.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.229
I recognize
that "I don't care" pout

13:51.231 --> 13:54.866
and the Thousand Island
dressing in my hair.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.835
Max, just because
you're hanging on a wall

13:56.837 --> 13:59.704
among the poorest,
most lost souls in our city

13:59.706 --> 14:02.607
doesn't mean
that your life is...

14:02.609 --> 14:05.844
I'm hanging
right behind me, aren't I?

14:07.647 --> 14:09.881
Oh, my God!

14:09.883 --> 14:12.884
It could be worse.
You could be naked.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.886
This is worse
than being naked!

14:14.888 --> 14:17.655
I'm wearing polyester!

14:17.657 --> 14:19.657
It's bad enough
I'm a waitress in Brooklyn.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.860
Now I'm a waitress
in Manhattan,

14:21.862 --> 14:24.629
and these guys
didn't even tip!

14:24.631 --> 14:26.664
No, no, no, it's a photograph,

14:26.666 --> 14:28.466
so it's more symbolic.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.870
It's called "Waitress"

14:31.872 --> 14:34.005
and I'm holding
a check pad.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.875
What do all these
blue dots mean?

14:36.877 --> 14:39.811
Is my picture in trouble?

14:39.813 --> 14:42.747
That's how many times
your print has been purchased.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.354
Over here, Max,
away from that

14:49.356 --> 14:52.223
pathetic blonde lady
in the waitress uniform.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.093
Will you relax?
No one even recognized you.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.729
No one?
What about that art critic

14:57.731 --> 14:59.264
who said that
"my smile on the photo

14:59.266 --> 15:02.233
"was a study of tragic,
foolish optimism

15:02.235 --> 15:05.336
in a hopeless,
dead-end life"?

15:06.740 --> 15:09.274
Oh,<i> him.</i>

15:09.276 --> 15:10.775
"Hopeless, dead-end life"?

15:10.777 --> 15:12.977
And then worse,
no one buys me?

15:12.979 --> 15:15.747
I'm not even a success
as a failure?

15:15.749 --> 15:19.651
You're totally
a success as a failure.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.452
Then where are all
the blue dots, Max?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.688
15 people bought you.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.157
Whatever you do,
don't turn around.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.426
Look at these dots!

15:31.364 --> 15:34.532
I am going home
with all these people--

15:34.534 --> 15:37.302
men, women, black, white.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.971
It's like a key party
at Joe Namath's house

15:39.973 --> 15:42.273
in the '70s.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.680
Hey, Shecky!

15:48.682 --> 15:51.716
Why are you putting a dot
by your friend's photo?

15:51.718 --> 15:54.352
Uh, how many extra croutons
can you buy

15:54.354 --> 15:57.255
with the buttload of money
you're making from these photos?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.524
A buttload.
Okay, Okay.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.060
I get it, you're mad.
Tell you what.

16:02.062 --> 16:05.396
I will give you
a free print of your photo.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.231
Look, keep the photo.

16:07.233 --> 16:10.101
I don't want a picture
of me marrying ketchups.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.904
I don't want a picture of me
marrying anybody.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.239
But you can pay me back
another way.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.408
I told you,
I'm not a lesbian.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.444
I just wear hats.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.949
Your friend says
you hate your photo.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.150
No.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.453
I enjoy being
secretly photographed

16:28.455 --> 16:31.923
while I'm stealing someone
extra,<i> extra</i> croutons.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.324
For the record,

16:33.326 --> 16:36.260
I never saw your smile
as foolish.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.929
I saw it as, uh...

16:37.931 --> 16:39.797
just a little big.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.767
Uh--I'm trying to
pay you a compliment.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.736
Well, you failed.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.338
All this time,
when you looked at me,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.273
I thought you saw
something special,

16:49.275 --> 16:52.076
but all you really saw was
someone reading the specials.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.579
I have a question
for you.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.215
Okay, fine.
I wear the derby

16:57.217 --> 17:00.585
because I have a little
bit of a bald spot.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.488
Why didn't I sell?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.390
The picture sucks.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.058
One of my worst.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.993
If you're still trying
to give me a compliment,

17:08.995 --> 17:10.328
you're still failing.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.497
Look, a good photograph

17:12.499 --> 17:14.499
captures the truth.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.268
And I guess
no one really believes

17:17.270 --> 17:19.437
<i>you</i> as a waitress.

17:21.341 --> 17:25.043
That is the single nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.445
So it's not where
you wanna be--I get it.

17:27.447 --> 17:31.282
Look, it's taken me 50 years
to be where I am.

17:31.284 --> 17:35.186
And you are still
<i>so young.</i>

17:35.188 --> 17:37.288
That is
the second-nicest thing

17:37.290 --> 17:39.290
anyone's ever said to me!

17:39.292 --> 17:42.627
The road is long,
and trust me,

17:42.629 --> 17:45.897
it can be really hard.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.799
So whatever you do,

17:47.801 --> 17:51.135
you hold on to that
foolishly hopeful smile.

17:51.137 --> 17:55.440
And...your funny friend.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.608
Yes?
- Yes.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.379
Uh, everyone,
tonight we are witness

18:01.381 --> 18:03.981
to the amazing work

18:03.983 --> 18:05.817
of Nola Anderz.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.652
[applause]

18:07.654 --> 18:09.987
Why don't we all
just stand here quietly

18:09.989 --> 18:14.792
for a moment
and let Nola's pictures speak.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.463
[cell phone ringing]

18:18.465 --> 18:20.531
That's my phone.
Where is it?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.167
[ringing]

18:23.169 --> 18:26.904
Baby, why is my phone
in your bra?

18:26.906 --> 18:28.639
Shh, please!

18:28.641 --> 18:31.876
It's your secret phone!
I know all about it.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.178
[ringing]
- You took it?
Give it to me.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.315
Who is she, Oleg?
Who is this skanky old whore?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.183
Security!
Security!

18:40.753 --> 18:42.920
What--no, no, no!
Stop, stop--she has my phone.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.589
It's his boner phone,
everybody!

18:44.591 --> 18:46.224
It's his boner phone!

18:48.895 --> 18:51.429
And you had the testicles
to think

18:51.431 --> 18:54.165
I was gonna embarrass you.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.837
Hey, Sophie.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.305
Hey, girls.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.907
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

19:02.909 --> 19:05.476
It sounds a little
bit like...I don't know.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.179
The sound of cheating.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.281
You guys
haven't made up yet?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.816
Don't make up here.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.018
No. I slept
on the couch.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.120
I missed her so much,
I watched a romcom

19:16.122 --> 19:19.624
while eating a whole box
of her edible underwear.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.193
Still not talking to me,
Sophie?

19:22.195 --> 19:25.463
For the last time,
there's nobody else but you.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.798
I use that phone...
Yes?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.534
to...
Go on.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.136
I use it to call...
Cut to the chase!

19:32.138 --> 19:34.172
My mother.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.508
Is there no one
he won't sleep with?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.277
I didn't tell you because

19:39.279 --> 19:41.279
I didn't want you to think
I was a mama's boy.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.115
Except when we play
"Mama and Boy."

19:44.117 --> 19:45.850
Well...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.618
I'll tell you
what I told that girl

19:47.620 --> 19:49.954
at the Yankee Candle store.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.456
"I'm not buyin' it!"

19:52.458 --> 19:54.625
It's true, Sophie.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.795
I'm afraid I'm...
losing my hair.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.666
Oh...Oleg.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.868
But don't you know...

20:03.870 --> 20:07.838
I mean, you could be
balder than Jeremy Piven was

20:07.840 --> 20:12.476
15 years ago,
and I'd still love ya.

20:12.478 --> 20:17.381
[phone ringing]

20:17.383 --> 20:19.517
Where's my--
[ringing]

20:19.519 --> 20:22.653
Busted.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.157
Caroline,
I have something for you.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.192
I'm not signing
another one of those

20:28.194 --> 20:30.928
giant birthday cards
again.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.702
It's my picture.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.838
Great. Now I have two of you
that don't wait on tables.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.274
"Thanks for the croutons.
Nola."

20:43.276 --> 20:45.343
Max, where are we
gonna hang me?

20:45.345 --> 20:47.178
Maybe you should hang yourself
in the bathroom

20:47.180 --> 20:49.647
like I thought you would
three years ago.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.783
Yep. I lost $20 on that bet.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.318
You know, Max,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.754
maybe I have to stop running
away from this part of my life

20:56.756 --> 20:59.290
and embrace it,
see it as part of my journey,

20:59.292 --> 21:02.059
my...beautiful,
exciting journey.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.596
If you don't shut up,
I'm gonna hang you right here.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.834
[cha-ching]
