[opening theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.720
[man] Hey!

00:31.531 --> 00:33.324
[Bean groans]

00:34.117 --> 00:35.952
[grunts] I'd say it's good to be back,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.955
but I can't shake the feeling
that life is meaningless

00:39.039 --> 00:40.582
and I'm gonna die alone.

00:40.665 --> 00:44.335
I'm cold, and I hate everything,
and this gravel really hurts,

00:44.419 --> 00:48.798
but it's exactly how I feel inside,
so it makes sense.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.885
Those were my pet squirrel's
last words before he died.

00:51.968 --> 00:55.638
He was a talking squirrel.
He got run over by a wheelbarrow.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.474
Those were his only words.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.892
[elf grunts]

00:58.975 --> 01:01.603
Get lost, you deadbeat! See you in church!

01:01.686 --> 01:02.896
Oh, hey, deadbeats.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.939
Whoa. You two look like you need a drink.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.275
I say that to all my customers,
but this time I mean it.

01:07.358 --> 01:10.528
No, thanks.
That's just gonna make me sadder.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.615
And then happier. And then sadder.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.742
Me and Bean both had our hearts broken.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.828
She fell in love with a mermaid,
but it might've been in her head.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.039
And Elfo fell for a gal
who was just a head.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.875
Obviously, we're not fixated
on traditional body norms.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.169
Wow. You two are really hurt, huh?

01:26.252 --> 01:29.506
Noice! I don't want to miss this. [scats]

01:33.593 --> 01:35.470
Halt! Why goes there?

01:35.553 --> 01:39.557
Not "why," you idiot. "Who."
Besides, you know who it is. It's Bean.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.809
Bean's an idiot?

01:40.892 --> 01:42.727
No, you are! That's who.

01:42.811 --> 01:43.937
I'm who goes there?

01:44.020 --> 01:47.982
No! Who goes there, goes there.
And now they're gone.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.319
Good to know
the kingdom is still in safe hands.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.243
Sire, would you like to do something

01:58.326 --> 02:01.037
about the people in the streets
who are dying of starvation?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.747

02:02.831 --> 02:04.666

02:04.749 --> 02:08.461
Uh, speakin' of starvation,
I'm in the mood for several shish kebabs

02:08.545 --> 02:11.131
and some, like…

-Announcing the unexpected return

02:13.758 --> 02:15.260
of Princess Tiabeanie!

02:15.343 --> 02:18.429
Warning, she appears
to be in a bit of a mood.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.098
-[slaps]
-Ow!

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
[Odval] Hmm…

02:22.058 --> 02:25.145
Beanie, you're back!
How was the health spa?

02:25.228 --> 02:26.980
Um, what?

02:27.063 --> 02:29.649
I had to tell poor Zøggy
you were somewhere safe

02:29.732 --> 02:31.401
because he is losing his mind.

02:31.484 --> 02:35.572
Did you get chazzed? I did. [babbles]

02:35.655 --> 02:37.490
I think he's getting worse.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.993
-[honking]
-Quiet! That's enough!

02:40.076 --> 02:41.578
Every time Zøg honks,

02:41.661 --> 02:44.581
he takes one step closer
to total insanity.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.665
-[honks]
-Oh, no.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.126
He's just gone from nuts to screwy.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.796
I have been looking after him
for weeks, and now it's your turn.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.965
-[honks]
-Ugh. I need nap.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.550
I've got a lot to do now.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.052
Like go to my room
and cry in the fetal position.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.096
My pillow's not gonna sob into itself.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.932
-[slaps]
-I deserve that.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.940
This could ruin everything.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.235
We must inform the Secret Society
of Tiabeanie's return.

03:14.319 --> 03:18.239
Indeed. The time to act is now.
Wink, wink.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.909
Don't say, "Wink, wink." Just wink.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.285
Oh, sorry.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.370
-Wink.
-[sighs]

03:24.454 --> 03:25.955
[Zøg exclaiming and babbling]

03:37.634 --> 03:41.137
[sighs] Finally, all alone.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.181
-Oh, hello, Princess!
-Bunty!

03:43.264 --> 03:44.515
I missed you, ma'am.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.560
I've thought about you
every single day since you've been gone,

03:47.644 --> 03:48.645
waiting right here.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.397
I'm gonna be honest.
I completely forgot about you

03:51.481 --> 03:54.359
until this very second.
Let's catch up later, though.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.904
Righty-o! Come along, children.
You, too, Bunty Junior.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.373
I was conceived in this bed.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.005
-[sighs]
-[Oona] Vello again.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.759
-My God! Oona, you're relentless.
-Thank you.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.511
Leave me alone, okay?

04:21.594 --> 04:22.845
I just need time to forget

04:22.929 --> 04:25.431
about the greatest thing
that ever maybe didn't happen to me.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.642
You can bother me again
when I grow a new heart.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.895
You look confused 'cause
you grow stuff back all the time,

04:30.979 --> 04:32.605
but that's not something I can do.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.901
I know is hard to believe,
but I was once in love. Real love.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.612
When it came to an end, I wanted to die.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.781
Yeah, samesies.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.243
I drop down for
stepmother-crazy daughter talk, okay?

04:45.952 --> 04:50.707
Bean, death is not good option.
I had to move on with my life.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.294
I got over my love
by getting under your dad.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.171
-Ew!
-Oh, don't play dainty with me.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.132
We don't have time for you to wallow.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.925
Wallowing is underrated.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.512
People no longer expect things from you
and you get to stop showering.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.557
I'm stuck with the sad,
empty feeling of heartbreak

05:07.640 --> 05:10.476
without ever getting
the fun relationship part!

05:10.560 --> 05:12.937
Full disclosure,
it did get pretty hot, though.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.689
I mean, if it really happened.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.108
We were on this beach and, like,

05:17.191 --> 05:21.821
it was so hot that I didn't even care
about the sand, if you know what I mean.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.906
Ah, yes, like sea turtle.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.534
No, Oona, not like sea turtle.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.994
Like sand crab?

05:28.077 --> 05:30.747
You know what?
It doesn't really matter, Oona, okay?

05:30.830 --> 05:31.748
Just forget it.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.460
Sweetie, you're young
and beautiful and sandy.

05:35.543 --> 05:39.547
Someday, the right man, or woman,
or creature will mate with you.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.631
Then you must eat them.

05:40.715 --> 05:46.304
Until then, you mustn't run from reality.
And things like booze will not help.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.305
Then what will?

05:47.388 --> 05:48.306
Drugs.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.728
Uh, I don't feel any…

05:53.811 --> 05:55.480
[yells] Whoa! There it is!

05:55.563 --> 05:57.190
Now, as you scream,

05:57.273 --> 06:01.319
think about key moments in your life
and see them in new light.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.029
[both screaming]

06:08.743 --> 06:10.203
[both grunt]

06:10.286 --> 06:14.499
Whoa, I'm seeing my life
flash before my eyes. [gasps] Am I dying?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.209
No, is effect of drugs.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.170
Unless you took too much drugs,
in which case, you are dying.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.339
Dying, I'm gonna go with it.

06:21.422 --> 06:25.009
'Cause I let my friend Elfo die
and where do you go when you die?

06:25.093 --> 06:28.012
Elfo went to Heaven, but I ended up
going to Hell to rescue him.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.181
I'd rescue him anywhere.
We gotta get the band back,

06:30.264 --> 06:32.683
but guess what?
We never even got back together,

06:32.767 --> 06:35.061
and we all talk about it,
and it's never gonna happen.

06:35.144 --> 06:38.856
But you know what? I'm still a good friend
'cause I went to Hell for him and got him!

06:38.940 --> 06:40.399
Maybe that's my purpose.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.194
I mean, go to Hell for people.
What else has gone to Hell?

06:43.277 --> 06:45.071
What else can I go to Hell for?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.322
Dreamland!

06:46.405 --> 06:49.617
Oh, my God!
I need to be a friend to Dreamland.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.786
Is good realization.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.914
My whole life has been a lie.
The mother I trusted is evil.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.874
The stepmother
I thought was evil is harmless.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.794
Oh, yes, evil stepmother trope
is very problematic.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.588
I've been through a lot.
I evaded two loveless weddings,

07:02.672 --> 07:04.549
one where the guy accidentally got killed.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.843
Not my fault.
Maybe a little bit. Whatever.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.429
The second one, the guy turned into a pig.
Not my fault. Maybe a bit. Whatever.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.182
I had a love-filled
fantasy hallucination with a mermaid

07:13.266 --> 07:16.936
and I still have a sweet,
pint-sized stalker who I love, sure.

07:17.019 --> 07:20.356
But, like, I'm not in love with.
There's a difference, you know?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.442
People say they have personal demons,

07:22.525 --> 07:25.736
but I actually have one
that was sent to destroy my life.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.655
I mean, we're all at odds, but…

07:27.738 --> 07:30.241
Oh, my God, we form a trio.
Just like the Trøgs said.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.659
What the hell is Trøgs?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.786
No amount of drugs
in the world could explain them.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.247
Now I don't know
what's real and what's a dream.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.916
That's what Luci once said,
but he was high, so I discounted it.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.918
But now I think it means something.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.505
All I really know is that
I need to focus on things that I can fix.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.133
Like, how bad I smell.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.844
Oh, my God, I wanna shower again.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.430
That means I've regained the will to live!

07:52.513 --> 07:54.932
I have to start believing in myself
because I'm a savior

07:55.016 --> 07:58.561
and saviors save people
from things like scary robots!

07:58.644 --> 08:02.148
Robots are basically tiny suits
of armor without anyone inside of them

08:02.231 --> 08:04.650
that roll around on squeaky wheels
and try to kill you.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.571
But they're super easy to tip over.
And Steamland also has one of my boots.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.992
Someday I will get that boot back.
As God as my witness, I will get it back.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.453
But the absolute most insane thing of all?

08:15.536 --> 08:18.164
There is this giant wall of sandwiches.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.875
Okay, that's quite enough, Tiabeanie.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.961
You must remember that women,
or womanish variants,

08:24.045 --> 08:26.130
are not allowed at these council meetings.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.925
But gender is a construct.
You guys have to listen.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.637
Steamland, an entire country,
is out to get us.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.348
They want our magic,
but we don't have any magic.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.434
We don't even have reggae.
But, please, you gotta believe me!

08:38.518 --> 08:42.230
All we believe is
that you just spewed a bunch of nonsense.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.314
You, scrivener.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.234
Strike everything Princess Tiabeanie
just said from the record.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.444
All 37 minutes, sir?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.906
-Hmm.
-Hmm. Cutting from quote,

08:51.989 --> 08:54.325
"Whoa, dude,
these drugs are really kicking in."

08:54.408 --> 08:58.538
"Oh, wow. I can't feel my face.
Do I still have a face?"

08:58.621 --> 09:00.665
"You know
what I feel like doing right now?"

09:00.748 --> 09:04.377
"I really wanna stab that stuck-up
scrivener in the eye with a fork."

09:04.460 --> 09:07.171
-[groans]
-And you two, scoot.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.846
What, they think that I'm gonna
go back to my bedroom and cry?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.223
I'll show them.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.849
Oona, how do we show them?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.186
[Oona groaning]

09:24.689 --> 09:26.440
Classic Oona.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.325
Hey, Snarla? Can I ask you somethin'?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.869
Did I ever tell you about the big skillet?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
[Snarla] Yeah,
shut up about the skillet, Derek.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.872
Yikes.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.251
[wind whistling]

09:45.334 --> 09:49.547
Oh, boy. Thank God
this is just a hallucination.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.344
She's clearly a threat.
And she might be on to us.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.431
Do you think she knows
about the royal curse?

09:58.514 --> 09:59.849
Or the Secret Society?

09:59.932 --> 10:03.769
Or the much more inconsequential return
of Stryker and Bolt?

10:04.770 --> 10:09.066
Doubtful. She's usually in too much
of an alcoholic haze to really notice.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.694
Man, I feel sorry
for whoever they're talkin' about.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.196
But we must do something about the king.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.199
It is inconvenient
that Zøg is still alive.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.076
[Apothecary]
Judging from the blood sample I took,

10:19.160 --> 10:20.870
he should be dead ten times over.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.040
I use the term "blood" loosely.
It's really more of a sauce.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.626
He's the last member
left in the family lineage

10:26.709 --> 10:28.794
before the curse is finally lifted.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.423
In the alphabet,
there's no letter after "Z."

10:32.506 --> 10:34.133
At least, not that I know of.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.303
We should hasten his demise,
just as we did with his brother.

10:37.386 --> 10:42.350
Indeed. But I fear
Zøg is not as easy a target as Yøg.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.645
But he is a bigger target.
Huh? Huh? [chuckles]

10:47.480 --> 10:48.481
Oh, no!

10:48.564 --> 10:49.982
Hiya, Bean!

10:50.066 --> 10:52.401
We must gather again
to set our plan in motion

10:52.485 --> 10:54.320
with the aid of the Secret Society.

10:54.403 --> 10:59.075
It begins and ends
at our meeting at the next full moon.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.744
Uh, will there be an orgy?

11:01.827 --> 11:03.037
Yes.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.997
Do not bring Turbish.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.290
[breathing heavily]

11:12.421 --> 11:15.800
-[Elfo] Um, who is it?
-It's Bean. Let me in. I need your help!

11:15.883 --> 11:17.676
[Elfo] Oh. Yeah, just a minute.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.969
[clattering]

11:20.471 --> 11:21.722
[Elfo whimpers]

11:21.806 --> 11:23.224
I don't have all night!

11:23.307 --> 11:25.184
You can do
what I think you're doing later.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.813
[clears throat] Please. Come in.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.440
Care for a bowl of cereal?

11:33.943 --> 11:38.155
Oh, cool.
I see you kept all my doll furniture.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
I also kept the accessories.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.993
That's my old toothbrush.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.037
But listen, there are people inside

11:45.121 --> 11:47.957
and outside this castle
who want my dad dead,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.084
and the kingdom is totally unprotected.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.336
Remember the Trøgs said we're the saviors?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.381
I pretty much just remember
what Trixy told me. [shudders]

11:55.464 --> 11:56.799
And… [shudders]

11:56.882 --> 11:58.259
Oh, and… [exclaiming]

11:58.342 --> 12:00.469
I never ask you for little favors,

12:00.553 --> 12:03.639
but I need you and Luci
to raise an army immediately.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.558
Think you can get people to enlist?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.518
Get people to do
something they don't wanna do?

12:07.601 --> 12:10.062
That's my specialty.
Elfo, you're doing this, too.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.064
I don't want to, but okay.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.774
-[door opens]
-[Zøg snoring]

12:18.612 --> 12:21.740
Psst! Oona, vake up.
I have something to ask you.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.534
Ugh. Now what?

12:24.577 --> 12:27.580
-First of all, do you have any more drugs?
-No, greedy.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.749
You took four times the amount I did,
so there is nothing left.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.669
Second, I learned
more about Odval's conspiracy.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.547
While some of the plot seems like
they're thinking of it on the fly,

12:36.630 --> 12:39.550
there's obviously something deeper
they've planned all along.

12:39.633 --> 12:44.805
[shushes] Is not place to discuss.
We must not risk waking your father.

12:44.889 --> 12:49.351
Remember, he cannot handle
any sort of surprise whatsoever.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.352
[hawk screeches]

12:53.230 --> 12:54.398
[hawk screeches]

12:54.482 --> 12:56.066
[Oona] So, what did you hear?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.903
You know, just that
there's some curse on our family

12:58.986 --> 13:02.615
and the Secret Society
is responsible for killing my Uncle Yøg.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.993
And I forgot to mention that they want
to take my dad out now, too!

13:06.076 --> 13:09.288
They killed love of my life? [sobs]

13:09.371 --> 13:10.623
They will pay!

13:10.706 --> 13:12.166
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.628
Before Zøg, I was in love with Yøg.

13:15.711 --> 13:19.340
Hold on, the guy you were
talking about before was my uncle?

13:19.423 --> 13:21.592
Wow, you really have a type, huh?

13:21.675 --> 13:24.220
Is true. Zøg reminded me of Yøg.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.389
Unfortunately, Zøg had
all of Yøg's bad qualities

13:27.473 --> 13:28.807
and none of his good ones.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.352
Yeah, I can see that. So, what we do now?

13:31.435 --> 13:34.188
Well, good news is
you are clearly over your heartbreak.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.524
Bad news is this is very bad news.

13:36.607 --> 13:40.402
Let's murder everyone in that stupid
Secret Society right this second.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.488
No. Is not best tactic.

13:42.571 --> 13:46.492
We must shadow the shadow organization
so that we can learn their plan.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.827
Wow, Oona, you're so wise.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.039
Well, I get enlightenment from my weed.

13:52.122 --> 13:55.668
My one regret is that I didn't start
taking drugs at younger age.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.472
-[upbeat music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

14:08.556 --> 14:11.642
Calling all alkies!
Join the Dreamland army.

14:11.725 --> 14:15.896
The noblest way to abandon
your family for long stretches of time!

14:15.980 --> 14:18.899
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Luci yelling] Line up, losers!

14:18.983 --> 14:22.945
Do you like travel, exercise, fascism,

14:23.028 --> 14:26.323
beatin' your comrades
with a bar of soap in a sock,

14:26.407 --> 14:29.118
and murder with no consequences?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.828
[all clamoring] Yeah!

14:32.288 --> 14:35.332
[grunts] Old Man Touchy
reporting for duty.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.709
[gibbers]

14:37.501 --> 14:40.087
Ugh! Save it for the battlefield, soldier.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.105
-[gasps]
-[Odval] What happened to all the knives?

14:58.188 --> 15:01.859
Rats, like, swiped 'em. [chuckles]

15:01.942 --> 15:04.028
We've barely time
to put this affair in motion

15:04.111 --> 15:07.197
and without every necessary element,
our plan is doomed.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.284
We'll split up to most efficiently
gather the remaining items.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.745
Like when we're antiquing. Wink, wink.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.623
-I mean, wink.
-[sighs]

15:15.706 --> 15:19.668
And we will split up and follow them.
But remember--

15:19.752 --> 15:23.797
Don't get too close.
Yeah, I totally got it down! [exclaims]

15:24.840 --> 15:28.969
Whoa. This morning I wanted to die
and now, not so much.

15:32.890 --> 15:37.603
Greetings, Darrell. Blessings on your hat
and the head that fills it.

15:37.686 --> 15:41.982
And also with you, Prime Minister Odval.
What can I do for you today?

15:42.066 --> 15:45.527
Googly-eyed clamshell?
Edge of the World Fudge? Gum?

15:45.611 --> 15:49.990
[chuckles] No, Darrell. Today I need
something far more nefarious.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.034
Did that book I ordered come in?

15:52.117 --> 15:54.870
I have it right here.
How to Hypnotize Your Boss.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.871
It's pretty good.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.082
You know
how to keep your mouth shut, don't you?

15:58.165 --> 15:59.166
Sure, I guess.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.710
-Even under pain of torture?
-Sure, I guess.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.047
You ever get the feeling
your life is going nowhere, Darrell?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.131
Sure, I guess.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.512
Oh, Mr. Odval?

16:11.595 --> 16:14.390
[in hypnotist voice]
You're getting sleepy.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.641
Oh, shut up, Darrell.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.538
These two are Numb and Number.

16:37.621 --> 16:41.959
Causes paralysis so you can
tell people off before their demise.

16:42.042 --> 16:45.921
And who can resist
the sweet allure of poisoned cake?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.590
'Course you'll have to wait
for your victim's birthday

16:48.674 --> 16:51.010
and they'll have to be named
"Gordon" as well.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.429
Oh, I don't have that sort of time.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.932
Well, I do have
the world's deadliest scorpion.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.350
[thud]

16:58.434 --> 17:00.811
Bill? Bill?

17:02.354 --> 17:03.355
Bill?

17:03.439 --> 17:06.316
Welcome to Dirk's Dirks. I'm Henry.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.485
Hello, Henry. I am Odval.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.156
[whispers] I am looking
for an array of stabbing instruments.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.616
-[chuckles]
-You don't got to whisper, my man!

17:14.700 --> 17:18.245
You want a dozen of our sharpest dirks
to murder some people with?

17:18.328 --> 17:19.955
Well, comin' right up!

17:26.045 --> 17:29.089
Move it, you dirty maggots
and Mertz's mom!

17:29.173 --> 17:30.716
You're the most pathetic scum

17:30.799 --> 17:33.594
I have ever had the misfortune
of layin' eyes on,

17:33.677 --> 17:36.930
and I spend most of my days
starin' at Elfo!

17:37.014 --> 17:38.348
Hi, I'm Corporal Elfo.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.434
[whistle blows]

17:40.517 --> 17:42.603
What do you call those, boy?

17:42.686 --> 17:43.937
Uh, pull-ups, sir.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.731
I seen better pull-ups on a baby!

17:45.814 --> 17:48.525
Are you chazzin' me?
Seriously, are you freakin' chazzin' me?

17:48.609 --> 17:51.028
Hey, they said
this was don't chazz, don't tell!

17:55.616 --> 17:56.450
[whispers] Oona.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.786
Oona, stop hibernating.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.621
I tailed Odval up and down

18:00.704 --> 18:03.457
and all over the place
and I figured it all out.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.043
The Secret Society is gonna kill Zøg.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.921
Come on, let's go slit
their fat, dumb necks right now.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.757
Oh, love the homicidal impulse, but no.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.302
Only thing we must do now
is wait for them to come to us.

18:15.385 --> 18:18.639
But I only like gratification
when it's instant.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.057
[tense music playing]

18:21.225 --> 18:22.434
Full moon.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.953
Ugh, crazy girl.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.289
Zøggy, don't go nowhere. I be back.

18:44.373 --> 18:49.545
Okay, Oona, I stay here. [snoring]

18:50.295 --> 18:52.005
Oh, no, I gotta pee.

18:52.673 --> 18:53.757
[snoring]

18:54.508 --> 18:56.802
-I really gotta pee.
-[door closes]

19:39.845 --> 19:41.180
[snoring]

19:43.140 --> 19:44.892
-Oh, Boss.
-What the…

19:44.975 --> 19:47.895
Look into my eye, Your Majesty.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.355
-The creepy one?
-Yes.

19:50.439 --> 19:55.652
At midnight, you'll come below the castle
for a special surprise.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.531
Oh, yeah? What? Corned beef?

19:59.615 --> 20:04.161
Yes, corned beef.
Lots and lots of corned beef.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.121
Ya got pulled pork?

20:06.205 --> 20:09.708
-There'll be pulled pork, yes.
-Pulled pork is good.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.251
Leg of lamb?

20:11.335 --> 20:15.589
Leg of lamb is there, too, yes.
Ah, big leg. Of lamb.

20:15.672 --> 20:19.968
-Tenderloin?
-Tenderloin, yes. Top sirloin.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.931
-Mmm. Leg of mutton, huh?
-Well, all right. Leg of mutton.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.808
-Leg of chicken?
-Whole chickens.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.645
-Lots of chickens…
-Yes, many chickens.

20:29.728 --> 20:33.398
Hey, what, you tryin'
to make a jerk out of me?

20:33.482 --> 20:34.733
Repeat after me.

20:34.816 --> 20:38.904
"At midnight, I must go to the basement
and enter the green door."

20:38.987 --> 20:42.491
At midnight, I must go to the basement
and enter the screen door.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.910
-Green door.
-Screen door.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.329
Just… [sighs] Just be there at midnight.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.497
[blows]

20:49.039 --> 20:50.207
[snoring]

20:51.959 --> 20:53.085
[chuckles]

21:12.187 --> 21:13.188
Phew!

21:16.066 --> 21:16.984
[Zøg snoring]

21:19.695 --> 21:23.031
[grunts] Odval? Is that you?

21:23.699 --> 21:25.993
Don't make me look at your eye no more.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.121
Oh. This ain't good.
I can't leave you here.

21:29.204 --> 21:33.125
Mmm, is it time for pork rump? [exclaims]

21:33.208 --> 21:34.835
[Oona] I hide you good, Zøggy.

21:34.918 --> 21:38.046
-[Zøg] There gonna be meatballs?
-[Oona] Stop talking about meat.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.215
[Zøg] What about
yummy little cocktail wieners?

21:42.759 --> 21:44.970
Trixy! What are you doing here?

21:45.053 --> 21:48.181
Shouldn't you be burrowing
or giving me the space we talked about?

21:48.265 --> 21:49.933
It's the full moon, silly.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.728
Trøgs climb to the surface
for our religion.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.731
-[whispers] And for fun.
-[whimpers]

21:55.814 --> 22:01.028
Ooh. It's so cool you're in the army now.
I love an elf who conforms.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.904
Aren't you gonna show me in?

22:02.988 --> 22:03.905
Ow!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.991
-[snoring]
-What the hell?

22:06.074 --> 22:08.201
[gasps and exclaims]

22:08.285 --> 22:10.912
I'm having that dream
with them pickled babies again.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.956
Oh, God, they're gettin' uglier.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.541
This is killing the mood, Elfo.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.877
[grunts] How did I get in here?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.880
Why are you trying to kill me?
Why is it so dark?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.965
Ooh, the last one I know.
'Cause it's nighttime.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.425
[gasping and grunting]

22:25.135 --> 22:26.636
Oh, God, my ass is stuck.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.805
[grunts and screams]

22:29.514 --> 22:30.599
[continues screaming]

22:32.642 --> 22:34.519
The wildest sex of your life
will have to wait.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.563
-The whatest what of my what?
-Let's go.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.441
[Elfo yelps]

22:39.524 --> 22:43.320
Help! Tell that moon to stop followin' me!

22:43.403 --> 22:46.114
It's almost midnight
and I'm gettin' hungry.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.075
-[bell tolling]
-[gasps] It is midnight!

22:48.158 --> 22:49.618
[honking]

22:52.329 --> 22:53.538
[babbling]

23:01.004 --> 23:03.590
[all] Moon!

23:04.716 --> 23:07.719
You're late, Trixy.
Were you with that possum again?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.054
Don't spoil it, Craig.

23:09.137 --> 23:12.933
[clears throat] Let the ceremony begin.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.851
Enter the circle.

23:15.435 --> 23:20.732
Today, folks. Come on.
Pants down, moons up.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.403
Pants down, Elfo! Oh, I'll do it.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.491
Good, good.

23:30.575 --> 23:33.954
Okay, make it through tonight
and you make it through basic training.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.081
Now, down on your bellies,
you worthless worms!

23:36.164 --> 23:38.959
Calling me a worm offends my eel heritage.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.669
Quit ditherin' and start slitherin'!

23:40.752 --> 23:42.129
[all grunting]

23:42.212 --> 23:43.463
[Mertz's mother] What's that noise?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.048
[smacking]

23:49.761 --> 23:53.056
-That's right, slap that bum-bum.
-[gasps]

23:53.140 --> 23:55.100
I like what I'm seeing, but I gotta go.

23:56.017 --> 23:56.893
[all exclaiming]

23:56.977 --> 23:59.938
Come back here, you cowards!
They're our allies!

24:00.021 --> 24:01.481
Where you going, Deserto?

24:01.565 --> 24:03.191
You knew this was coming.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.277
I just thought he liked sweets.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.657
Let the ceremony begin.

24:10.740 --> 24:16.288
Welcome to all seekers of the secret
and welcome, new members. [chuckles]

24:16.371 --> 24:20.625
Take your assigned position.
Masks on, hoods up.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.798
Sorcerio, have you done a head count?

24:26.882 --> 24:31.761
Oh, you know math isn't my strength,
but yes. The newcomers are here.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.472
Good. Let me remind all of you

24:34.556 --> 24:37.809
that by the time I finish this sentence,
there will be no backing out.

24:37.893 --> 24:38.977
[whimpers]

24:39.895 --> 24:43.440
Now, we have all waited
a long time for this.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.735
Are the new members
ready to carry out the task?

24:46.818 --> 24:47.903
[all] The task?

24:47.986 --> 24:49.154
That's what I said.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.699
The moment has finally come
for all to be revealed.

24:52.782 --> 24:56.077
In three, two, one.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.041
[gasps]

25:10.050 --> 25:13.136
Keepers of the secret,
what is the greatest sin?

25:13.220 --> 25:15.931
[all chanting] Modesty. Modesty. Modesty.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.349
Modesty.

25:17.432 --> 25:21.311
[sighs] God damn it.
Oh, newbies, we're waiting.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.982
-Oona?
-Bean?

25:26.066 --> 25:27.692
All right, drop your knives.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.946
At the sound of the maracas,
let the orgy begin.

25:31.029 --> 25:31.863
[woman] Ooh!

25:31.947 --> 25:34.741
Oh, my God.
They're not gonna kill my dad, are they?

25:34.824 --> 25:38.203
Is no murder cult, Bean.
Just depressing sex club.

25:38.286 --> 25:41.373
Now, Sorcerio. Fling open the green door.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.753
Come right in,
Your Majesty, and feast your eyes.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.966
Bean? Oona?

25:51.049 --> 25:52.217
[babbling]

25:53.426 --> 25:54.886
[grunts and screams]

25:55.470 --> 25:57.264
[maracas continue playing]

26:02.644 --> 26:04.145
Oh, we did it, Oddie.

26:04.229 --> 26:08.900
Zøg is 100%,
scientifically, medically bonkers.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.111
Naked Bean and Oona
were the crowning touch.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.780
Perhaps we should say
the de-crowning touch.

26:13.863 --> 26:17.492
Now, nothing stands in the way
of our grand secret scheme.

26:17.575 --> 26:18.827
[screaming]

26:20.620 --> 26:21.913
[Oona] Zøggy!

26:21.997 --> 26:24.541
-[Bean] Dad! Dad!
-[Oona] Zøggy!

26:26.042 --> 26:27.335
[snoring]

26:27.419 --> 26:30.088
Oh, good. He crazy'd himself to sleep.

26:30.171 --> 26:33.216
-Someone better guard him all night.
-[Turbish] Turbish will do it.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.014
[closing theme music playing]
