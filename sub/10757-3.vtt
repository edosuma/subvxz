00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:14.087 --> 00:17.045
Trick or treat.
Or should I say pip pip?

00:17.341 --> 00:21.095
- What's with the outfit?
- This is part of your costume.

00:21.428 --> 00:24.659
You said you were getting me
a Sherlock Holmes outfit.

00:24.973 --> 00:28.761
They were out of Sherlock Holmes.
Don't worry, it's another detective.

00:29.102 --> 00:32.299
You'll be Lord Peter Wimsey.

00:32.606 --> 00:33.721
Who's that?

00:33.941 --> 00:37.695
He's a sleuth from a series of novels
by Dorothy L Sayers.

00:38.028 --> 00:41.907
I'm not going anywhere where
I have to tell people my name's Wimsey.

00:42.241 --> 00:44.801
I'm just going to wear
my old police uniform.

00:45.077 --> 00:48.353
It's a Halloween ball
for the Library Association.

00:48.664 --> 00:51.098
You have to go
as a character from literature.

00:51.375 --> 00:55.004
Why didn't I go with Sherry
to visit her mother in prison?

00:57.130 --> 01:00.327
It'll be fun.
I'm going as Cyrano de Bergerac.

01:00.634 --> 01:02.590
Musician. Philosopher. Fighter.

01:02.844 --> 01:05.722
The greatest friend
and the bravest swordsman alive.

01:06.014 --> 01:08.164
What's all over your cane?

01:08.433 --> 01:11.186
I dropped it
in the movie theatre last night.

01:12.688 --> 01:15.327
I love this picture.
You look adorable in that.

01:15.607 --> 01:18.599
I do not. You like it
because you look so handsome in it.

01:18.902 --> 01:20.654
The camera doesn't lie.

01:20.904 --> 01:22.496
What are you giggling about?

01:22.739 --> 01:25.572
Snapshots from our trip
to the microbrewery.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.859
That must have been fun for you, Dad.

01:29.329 --> 01:31.559
- You're not in any of these.
- I didn't go.

01:31.832 --> 01:33.709
Eddie got into the poison oak.

01:33.959 --> 01:37.076
I was up all night rubbing
calamine lotion on his belly.

01:37.379 --> 01:40.974
These really are the golden years
for you, aren't they?

01:42.384 --> 01:44.375
So it was just you and Frasier?

01:44.636 --> 01:47.355
We got pretty silly
after tasting all that beer.

01:47.639 --> 01:50.551
There's no need to tell Niles
everything we did.

01:50.851 --> 01:52.842
Yes, we got a bit naughty.

01:55.772 --> 01:57.763
Not too naughty, I hope.

01:58.025 --> 02:00.220
Dr Crane,
I know what you're thinking.

02:00.485 --> 02:04.797
After all that drinking, we didn't drive
home. We spent the night in a motel.

02:07.284 --> 02:10.276
That takes a load off my mind.

02:10.579 --> 02:14.015
Niles, what time is this
little soiree of yours this evening?

02:14.333 --> 02:17.689
I've still got to get the velvet
in my slippers recrushed.

02:18.003 --> 02:20.915
Dad, I will find you
a Sherlock Holmes outfit.

02:21.215 --> 02:24.730
7.00pm. I have to get home
before Marta arrives to set up.

02:25.052 --> 02:26.610
She's arachnophobic.

02:26.845 --> 02:30.838
Last Halloween she beat my centrepiece
to bits with a broom.

02:31.183 --> 02:34.653
Perhaps we should go finish up
those costumes, wife.

02:34.978 --> 02:38.254
- Did you say "wife"?
- Hasn't your brother told you?

02:38.565 --> 02:41.921
He's going as Geoffrey Chaucer
from <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i>

02:42.236 --> 02:47.264
- I'll be dressed as the Wife of Bath.
- And a saucy strumpet she is, too.

02:47.658 --> 02:49.535
You naughty rogue.

02:49.785 --> 02:52.458
We've been having quite a time
talking like that.

02:52.746 --> 02:55.783
It's been ye olde laugh riot
around here.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.669
- Join me in my bed chamber, my lord?
- After you, my juicy wench.

03:02.005 --> 03:05.315
"My juicy wench"? No, not you, Maris.

03:07.052 --> 03:10.203
Wait. I hope you're happy.
She's run for her water pills.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.050
Roz, who's on the line?

03:16.311 --> 03:20.623
We have Ted
who is feeling a little disconnected.

03:21.483 --> 03:23.474
Go ahead, Ted.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.716
I hope Ted appreciates irony.

03:38.917 --> 03:43.672
On line two we have Bill. He's going
through a very difficult transition.

03:44.214 --> 03:47.411
- Hello, Bill.
- <i>Hello? Is someone there?</i>

03:49.887 --> 03:53.482
I see we're pretty much through
our transition, aren't we, Bill?

03:54.433 --> 03:56.742
- <i>This is Dorothy.</i>
- Bill's on line one.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.294
Let's just stay with Dorothy.

03:59.563 --> 04:01.713
- How can I help you?
- <i>You can get me Roz.</i>

04:01.982 --> 04:05.258
<i>I'm her manicurist.
She called for an appointment.</i>

04:06.236 --> 04:08.909
I'll call you back later, Dorothy.

04:09.656 --> 04:11.647
We'll take a moment to regroup.

04:11.909 --> 04:15.788
I apologise for the unusually
high number of technical difficulties

04:16.120 --> 04:20.433
we've experienced today. And now we will
go to these public service messages.

04:24.796 --> 04:27.833
- Explain yourself.
- I'm a little off my game today.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.124
- A little?
- OK, a lot.

04:30.385 --> 04:33.183
You come in looking ghoulish,
even for Halloween,

04:33.472 --> 04:35.781
and you sleepwalk through my show.

04:37.601 --> 04:41.389
- I'm sorry.
- What kind of explanation can there be

04:41.730 --> 04:44.608
for this level of unprofessionalism?

04:46.902 --> 04:48.893
I think I'm pregnant.

04:52.950 --> 04:53.939
Pregnant?

04:54.159 --> 04:58.949
I took a home test and it was iffy,
so I went to see my doctor.

04:59.331 --> 05:01.322
He'll call me with results later.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.302
- But, Roz, how?
- I don't know how.

05:04.586 --> 05:08.135
No one is more careful than I am
when it comes to birth control.

05:08.465 --> 05:12.936
But even the best protection
is only effective 99 out of 100 times.

05:13.303 --> 05:15.737
I can't beat those odds.

05:22.771 --> 05:26.161
I suppose you've been dodging
that bullet for a long time now.

05:26.567 --> 05:28.842
Promise you won't tell anyone.

05:29.111 --> 05:33.070
Of course not, Roz, but we don't even
know if we have anything to tell yet.

05:33.407 --> 05:36.444
- What if there is?
- We'll deal with that when we have to.

05:36.743 --> 05:39.303
No use crossing that bridge
until we come to it.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.571
I can't get my mind off it.

05:41.832 --> 05:44.107
Niles' party will be a distraction.

05:44.376 --> 05:47.334
- I don't think I'm up for that.
- Come on, Roz.

05:47.629 --> 05:51.542
- Well, I did rent a costume.
- It'll be fun. You know you want to.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.682
That's exactly the kind of talk
that got me into this.

05:56.138 --> 06:01.258
Tell your brother I'm coming to his
party. I found the perfect costume.

06:01.643 --> 06:04.032
What literary character will you be?

06:04.313 --> 06:06.031
Waldo.

06:07.441 --> 06:10.877
From <i>Where's Waldo?</i> He's in 16 books.

06:12.195 --> 06:14.186
You call yourself well-read.

06:32.299 --> 06:33.493
Niles Crane.

06:33.717 --> 06:36.914
Maris, where are you?
You're still at the beauty parlour?

06:37.930 --> 06:41.559
Calm down. Stop crying.
It can't be as bad as all that.

06:41.892 --> 06:44.247
Exactly how much hair do you have left?

06:47.189 --> 06:50.261
We just have to find
another character for you to be.

06:50.567 --> 06:53.286
There's an lonesco play
called <i>The Bald Soprano.</i>

06:54.780 --> 06:58.170
No, I'm joking, Maris.
You've got to come.

06:58.492 --> 07:02.531
Maris, you have 37 wigs.
Go down to the wig vault and pick one.

07:04.039 --> 07:08.829
Maris, this evening means a great deal
to me. I need you here with me.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.202
Do you care about my feelings at all?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.791
That answers that.

07:19.304 --> 07:21.295
How's the party?

07:21.557 --> 07:23.912
We just got here.
We had a bit of a delay.

07:24.184 --> 07:26.903
Sherlock led us to the wrong apartment.

07:27.187 --> 07:31.385
I notice you didn't complain when
the old lady gave us peanut-butter cups.

07:33.026 --> 07:34.823
Evening, all.

07:35.070 --> 07:39.143
What lovely costumes.
Daphne, you look particularly beautiful.

07:39.491 --> 07:44.167
Thanks. It's a bit tight.
I must have put on a pound or two.

07:44.538 --> 07:47.211
That's enough out of you,
you wanton troll,

07:47.499 --> 07:51.128
or I'll smite your bawdy backside
with the flat of my sinewy hand.

07:51.461 --> 07:54.612
At least on the ride over
I could stick my head out the window.

07:54.923 --> 07:58.472
- Where's the bar?
- Over here. I'm serving grog and mead.

07:58.802 --> 08:00.793
Which one tastes most like beer?

08:03.807 --> 08:05.798
Roz, I'm so glad you came.

08:06.059 --> 08:08.857
- Any word from the doctor?
- No. I am going crazy.

08:09.146 --> 08:12.138
I can't even picture myself
as a mother. Can you?

08:16.028 --> 08:18.417
I don't think discipline
will be a problem.

08:21.074 --> 08:23.065
Roz, don't you look smashing.

08:23.327 --> 08:25.966
What an interesting costume.
Who are you?

08:26.246 --> 08:28.760
I'm O from <i>The Story of O.</i>

08:29.750 --> 08:31.741
It's going to be a long night.

08:32.001 --> 08:35.631
I think you look lovely tonight.
There's a real glow about you.

08:35.964 --> 08:37.955
Oh, no. Not a glow.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.208
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little jumpy.

08:41.886 --> 08:45.516
I had an accident, and I haven't
found out what the damage is yet.

08:45.849 --> 08:48.602
I need to check my machine.
Is there a phone?

08:48.894 --> 08:50.612
At the top of the stairs.

08:50.854 --> 08:53.732
Try not to worry.
A few years back I got rear-ended.

08:54.024 --> 08:56.015
Is that what happened to you?

08:59.655 --> 09:01.646
Not exactly.

09:03.992 --> 09:05.664
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:05.911 --> 09:08.471
- Are you here alone?
- I hope so.

09:12.376 --> 09:17.655
What a delectable medley of fromagian
splendour. You must try one.

09:20.175 --> 09:21.164
Cheesy.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.741
Yes, cheesy.

09:26.431 --> 09:30.424
It must be glorious to have such a happy
knack for clarity and concision.

09:32.229 --> 09:33.218
Yep.

09:34.982 --> 09:36.415
Who are you?

09:36.650 --> 09:39.881
Chingachgook.
I'm the last of the Mohicans.

09:40.195 --> 09:42.914
Well, that little mystery's solved.

09:52.207 --> 09:54.960
- Have you seen Roz?
- She's probably on the phone.

09:55.252 --> 09:57.925
Every 15 minutes
she's calling her machine.

09:58.213 --> 10:00.932
This little accident's
got her pretty worried.

10:01.758 --> 10:04.113
- She told you about it?
- Champagne?

10:04.386 --> 10:07.742
Not now, Niles. Please, excuse us.
We need a moment alone.

10:08.056 --> 10:10.775
Roz told me all about it.
It's no big deal.

10:11.059 --> 10:14.893
Accidents happen even when you're
careful. I had one a few years back.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.956
Daphne, really?

10:18.191 --> 10:21.149
It was one of those
real wham-bam numbers.

10:22.946 --> 10:25.744
He was drunk
and I wasn't paying attention.

10:27.284 --> 10:29.923
I called
but never got a penny out of him.

10:30.204 --> 10:33.037
- I had no idea.
- It's not so bad.

10:33.332 --> 10:36.847
Back in Manchester with all those
drunken louts out and about,

10:37.169 --> 10:39.888
it must have happened to me
at least a dozen times.

10:43.759 --> 10:46.910
Really? I had no... Really?

10:50.432 --> 10:53.742
Nothing's certain
until we get the pregnancy test results.

10:54.061 --> 10:57.770
Pregnancy? We're not talking
about a car accident, are we?

10:58.106 --> 11:00.176
- Oh, dear.
- Roz is pregnant?

11:00.442 --> 11:04.037
- No. Where could you get such a notion?
- You just said she was.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.799
Shut up. Or I'm smite you
with the back of my sinewy right hand.

11:12.704 --> 11:15.218
- Did you notice where Frasier went?
- No idea.

11:15.499 --> 11:17.569
- What about Daphne?
- Haven't a clue.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.825
Holmes, you astound me.

11:20.963 --> 11:25.275
I just feel terrible about this.
Roz swore me to secrecy.

11:25.634 --> 11:29.149
- I never should have said anything.
- She thought I knew.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.224
Do you have a tissue?
These lashes are killing me.

11:32.516 --> 11:34.586
I must be allergic to the adhesive.

11:34.851 --> 11:38.560
Just promise me you won't tell a soul.
We've got to keep this secret.

11:38.897 --> 11:41.650
All right.
But we can't keep it a secret forever.

11:41.942 --> 11:44.695
We are talking about a baby.

11:47.155 --> 11:49.066
How could I have been so careless?

11:49.324 --> 11:53.476
- It's not your fault.
- You know who'll be blamed.

11:53.829 --> 11:56.389
Don't worry.
I'll protect your reputation.

11:57.124 --> 11:59.319
I'll tell everyone
I forced you to do it.

12:02.004 --> 12:05.917
Better get back to the party
before people start wondering about us.

12:07.676 --> 12:09.667
Hello, Niles.

12:10.804 --> 12:13.523
What's your nose
all bent out of shape about?

12:23.150 --> 12:25.948
There's a literary figure
I'd like to know better.

12:27.112 --> 12:29.785
- I need a word with you.
- What about?

12:30.699 --> 12:32.690
Stay there. I have guests to greet.

12:36.872 --> 12:38.510
Trick or treat.

12:38.749 --> 12:42.059
- How did you get past the doorman?
- We live in the building.

12:42.377 --> 12:45.972
- This isn't a good night for this.
- But it's Halloween.

12:47.216 --> 12:50.094
Crab puff for you,
and some gravlax for you,

12:50.385 --> 12:52.376
and paté for Dracula. Now off you go.

12:54.765 --> 12:56.756
I need to talk to you.

12:57.017 --> 13:00.692
Not now, Niles.
Let me guess. Lady Godiva?

13:01.021 --> 13:03.012
No, Eve. From the Bible.

13:03.273 --> 13:06.743
Well, now I know
why they call it the Good Book.

13:07.486 --> 13:11.843
- Are you just going to abandon Daphne?
- Just because I gave her a ride

13:12.199 --> 13:14.952
doesn't mean I have to spend
the evening with her.

13:20.123 --> 13:22.114
Get a load of that schnozzola.

13:23.794 --> 13:26.592
- No, wait. Guess who I am?
- I give up.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.871
I'm Waldo. From <i>Where's Waldo?</i>

13:29.132 --> 13:32.602
You know. The guy you can't find
because he blends into the crowd.

13:32.928 --> 13:35.442
I don't know,
but I'd love a demonstration.

13:38.600 --> 13:43.276
And to think that all that time your cat
was curled up in your sock drawer.

13:44.314 --> 13:46.305
They're almost human, aren't they?

13:46.567 --> 13:49.001
Pardon me,
I need a word with my brother.

13:49.278 --> 13:53.669
Not now. I'm doing really well here.
This pointy hat is a babe magnet.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.277
It's urgent.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.572
Just keep your voice down.
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

13:59.872 --> 14:01.464
Hurry back.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.934
Your behaviour is appalling.
I can no longer hold my tongue.

14:06.253 --> 14:09.165
Replace tongue with liquor.
You're drunk.

14:09.464 --> 14:11.455
Drunk like a fox.

14:13.594 --> 14:17.109
- I know about the baby.
- You do? Who told you?

14:17.431 --> 14:21.504
- I heard it from Daphne.
- Daphne? That blabbermouth.

14:21.852 --> 14:23.888
I'll wring her neck.

14:24.146 --> 14:28.697
- Have you no conscience?
- You're getting awfully exercised.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.706
We're talking about a single woman
with a baby.

14:31.987 --> 14:36.105
- What do you intend to do about it?
- I suppose I could give her a raise.

14:38.952 --> 14:41.341
That's your idea of responsibility?

14:41.622 --> 14:43.613
What do you want me to do, marry her?

14:43.874 --> 14:46.342
She's the one that got pregnant.

14:46.627 --> 14:48.902
- Hello, Roz.
- Beat it, Niles.

14:50.172 --> 14:51.605
Stay here.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.832
I am so mad at you.
How could you tell Niles about the baby?

14:55.135 --> 14:58.047
I didn't. Daphne told him,
that damnable chatterbox.

14:58.347 --> 15:01.817
- And who told Daphne?
- That would be me.

15:05.479 --> 15:08.789
What is it with all you children?
Isn't it past your bedtime?

15:09.524 --> 15:11.594
Dr Crane, it's me, Dr Krovitz.

15:13.237 --> 15:16.070
Of course.
And this must be your wife, Sylvia.

15:16.365 --> 15:19.243
- I don't know her.
- Trick or treat.

15:22.079 --> 15:24.832
I specifically
asked you not to tell anyone.

15:25.123 --> 15:28.672
The way she spoke sounded as if
she knew you were having a baby.

15:29.002 --> 15:30.993
What? You are?

15:31.505 --> 15:32.824
Nice going, Frasier.

15:33.048 --> 15:37.121
He is the master of deduction.
He would have figured it out anyway.

15:38.053 --> 15:40.044
Just let it out. I'm here for you.

15:40.305 --> 15:43.536
I keep telling you, I'm not crying.
It's my damn lashes.

15:43.850 --> 15:47.604
Courageous and beautiful.
You shouldn't be drinking this poison.

15:48.021 --> 15:50.012
Here, Roz, drink this.

15:50.899 --> 15:54.574
- Roz, do you have a tissue?
- If you don't see it, I don't have it.

15:55.404 --> 15:58.521
I'm sorry. Do you want
to get a napkin over here?

15:58.824 --> 16:00.974
Hurry back, brave girl.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.861
Just look at her, poor thing.

16:05.122 --> 16:07.761
What are you talking about?

16:08.041 --> 16:10.077
I suppose you'll find out.

16:10.335 --> 16:13.611
- There's a baby on the way.
- You know about that, too?

16:13.922 --> 16:16.595
- Who told you?
- I heard Frasier and Roz.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.273
You don't seem very surprised.

16:19.553 --> 16:22.431
I am fond of her,
but she's no Sunday school teacher.

16:22.723 --> 16:25.362
She's been around the block a few times.

16:26.643 --> 16:30.272
Instead of heaping scorn on her,
put the blame where it belongs.

16:30.606 --> 16:33.120
On Frasier.
The shameless Casanova.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.391
What's he got to do with this?

16:35.652 --> 16:37.643
- He's the father.
- What?

16:37.905 --> 16:41.784
- I heard it from his own mouth.
- I've got to go talk to him.

16:42.117 --> 16:45.075
Wait.
I've just made a momentous decision.

16:46.955 --> 16:50.391
There's one person in this family
who still has a sense of honour.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.781
Frasier may not be able
to do right by her, but I will.

16:54.087 --> 16:57.284
- What're you talking about?
- I'm going to propose to her.

16:57.591 --> 16:59.582
Are you nuts? You're still married.

16:59.885 --> 17:02.683
Maris never needed me.
But there's a woman who does.

17:02.971 --> 17:05.246
I didn't know you even liked her.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.798
Yes, I wore that mask well.

17:11.438 --> 17:13.633
It's time to do the honourable thing.

17:13.898 --> 17:18.494
Divorce your wife and marry the woman
who's carrying your brother's child?

17:20.531 --> 17:24.240
I've made up my mind.
Nothing's going to stop me, Dad.

17:24.576 --> 17:29.411
There's been a bit of an hors d'oeuvre
mishap on your Persian rug.

17:29.790 --> 17:32.702
Just call me Fumbles With Crab Puffs.

17:33.001 --> 17:34.673
Not now, Gil.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.876
There's no sense fretting about it
until you know for sure.

17:40.217 --> 17:42.208
My eyes are just getting worse.

17:42.469 --> 17:44.858
I should ask Dr Crane
to take me home.

17:45.138 --> 17:48.130
I feel bad ruining his good time.
I was having fun, too.

17:48.433 --> 17:51.630
There are some very attractive men here.

17:51.937 --> 17:54.576
But who's going to want me
in this condition?

17:56.108 --> 17:58.906
Don't worry about Frasier.
He'll take care of you.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.118
That's a laugh. Beat it, Roz.

18:03.407 --> 18:05.762
Never mind.
I have to go check my machine.

18:06.034 --> 18:07.023
Daphne,

18:08.954 --> 18:11.343
we've known each other
for four years now.

18:11.623 --> 18:14.615
Wait. I want to take the time
to phrase this just right.

18:14.918 --> 18:18.672
You take all the time you need.
I've got to go find your brother.

18:22.342 --> 18:24.492
Dr Crane, can I talk to you
for a moment?

18:26.930 --> 18:28.921
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

18:29.182 --> 18:33.141
It's OK. I'll go freshen my lipstick.
I feel naked without it.

18:35.230 --> 18:37.346
Haven't you ruined my evening enough?

18:37.608 --> 18:40.805
- What are you talking about?
- You and your blabbermouth.

18:41.111 --> 18:42.942
You told Niles about the baby.

18:43.197 --> 18:45.995
- I did not.
- Don't play innocent with me.

18:46.283 --> 18:50.913
I don't mean to ruin your evening,
but I can't stay. Look at my eyes.

18:51.288 --> 18:53.324
I am sorry for your condition,

18:53.582 --> 18:57.814
but you should have read the directions
on the package before you used it.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.918
I don't know why you're blaming
this whole mess on me.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.732
I just know
I need a lift home right now.

19:07.012 --> 19:10.288
All right. I'm not leaving here
until I get Eve's number.

19:10.599 --> 19:14.035
So sit, have a drink,
smoke a cigarette if you like.

19:15.229 --> 19:19.268
I am attracted to her and I won't let
you and your problem stand in my way.

19:19.608 --> 19:21.599
That's enough.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.772
Lower your voice.
You're embarrassing yourself.

19:25.072 --> 19:27.984
I'm embarrassed
that you're my brother.

19:28.283 --> 19:30.274
You cad, you bounder, you roué.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.687
What's wrong
about trying to get her number?

19:33.997 --> 19:37.751
We're not interested in your next
conquest but about your last one.

19:38.085 --> 19:40.076
And before you deny it, I have proof.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.370
From here it smells like 80 proof.

19:44.091 --> 19:46.844
A woman stands here before you
in dire need.

19:47.135 --> 19:49.854
I can find someone else who'll take me.

19:50.138 --> 19:52.129
- Indeed you can.
- Niles...

19:52.391 --> 19:54.382
Don't try to stop me.

19:55.686 --> 19:59.838
You seduce this poor woman and then
you aren't man enough to stand by her?

20:00.190 --> 20:01.862
Before you make an ass...

20:02.109 --> 20:05.226
Stop or I'll teach you
a long overdue lesson in chivalry.

20:07.281 --> 20:11.240
- But, Dr Crane, you...
- No, don't defend him.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.011
There may be one bastard in this family,

20:14.288 --> 20:16.802
but as long
as I have anything to say about it,

20:17.082 --> 20:19.391
your baby won't be another.
Daphne,

20:20.669 --> 20:24.184
- will you marry me?
- You drunken imbecile!

20:25.966 --> 20:28.844
Daphne's not the one who's pregnant.
Roz is.

20:32.639 --> 20:34.914
- Roz is?
- Who's Roz?

20:35.183 --> 20:37.174
She's the one dressed like O.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.408
That was very gallant.
Perhaps you should propose to Roz.

20:43.734 --> 20:47.488
If anybody's going to propose to Roz,
it's Frasier. How can you do that?

20:47.821 --> 20:52.178
- It was Frasier?
- I am not the father of Roz's baby.

20:52.576 --> 20:55.568
In fact, we don't even know for sure
if there is a baby.

20:55.871 --> 20:57.429
We do now.
