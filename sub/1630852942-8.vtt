00:20.640 --> 00:23.720
You can't have her,
she's mine!

01:09.480 --> 01:10.920
Where are you?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.400
I'll find you.

01:17.240 --> 01:22.120
You've trespassed,
I'll kill you.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.240
Villanelle!

02:12.240 --> 02:13.320
Hey!

02:16.920 --> 02:18.280
Were you watching that?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.600
What? Do you want me
to say thank you?

02:25.080 --> 02:28.240
Jesus,
I know where they are.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.080
Well, where they will be.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.800
We don't have much time.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.640
Konstantin said that you'd
know how to decode this,

02:34.680 --> 02:36.040
It's Helene's.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.720
You steal phones
from corpses now?

02:38.760 --> 02:43.200
They don't know she's dead yet.
They're having a meeting
and this is our chance.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.840
And this is why you're here?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.560
You <i>know</i> why I'm here.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.040
You want this as much as I do.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.280
What did you do to her?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.880
Why, are you looking
for inspiration?

03:34.320 --> 03:36.560
Villanelle!

03:41.560 --> 03:42.640
Amateur!

03:45.400 --> 03:46.800
Oh, are you kidding me?

03:51.040 --> 03:52.520
Villanelle!

03:52.560 --> 03:53.920
Jesus!

03:55.040 --> 03:57.880
Villanelle!

03:58.600 --> 04:00.880
Oh, God! She's coming.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.600
Jesus! Oh come on, come on.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.880
Jesus!

04:10.360 --> 04:12.840
I will kill you bitches!

04:19.200 --> 04:21.400
Villanelle!

04:28.680 --> 04:30.880
Villanelle!

04:47.640 --> 04:48.760
No signal.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.320
Well, maybe we can tether it?
Is your phone working?

04:57.880 --> 04:58.880
Are you gonna help?

05:03.080 --> 05:04.720
You just don't get it, do you?

05:04.760 --> 05:07.680
You don't want to say it, fine.
I don't care. But I can.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.840
I <i>need</i> you, Villanelle.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.800
I came all this way
to <i>be</i> with you

05:13.840 --> 05:15.600
and in the middle of...

05:16.160 --> 05:17.520
I'm like nowhere.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.320
You're angry? I'm angry.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.600
You're hurt, I'm hurt.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.120
That is life and we are
running out of time.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.600
So you need to stop pouting
and being like a suck face
and get on with it!

05:31.320 --> 05:33.200
No, stop!

05:33.240 --> 05:36.040
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Stop it. Stop... stop it!

05:36.080 --> 05:37.120
Are you kidding me?

05:37.160 --> 05:38.160
Hey!

05:39.800 --> 05:41.080
Are you two okay?

05:41.120 --> 05:43.680
All good thanks.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.320
Your accent is terrible.
You sound like a drunk bat.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.480
Come on then. Quick march.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.800
- Oh!
- Ah!

06:41.840 --> 06:43.920
<i>Mary Poppins!</i>

06:43.960 --> 06:48.880
Oh, the storms round here
come on in no time.

06:48.920 --> 06:52.320
We couldn't leave you
out there in the elements.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.440
- Could we, baba?
- Oh, that's right, honey.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.560
Oh it'll probably
blow over by morning.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.560
Until then, I guess we just
get to know each other.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.160
Yeah.
Chat.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.480
It might be fun!

07:22.640 --> 07:25.360
- So, how did you guys meet?
- Hmm.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.000
Oh she stalked me,
drove my husband away,

07:30.040 --> 07:31.960
- left me with nothing.
- She stalked me.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.080
She put me in prison,
she tongued my boss.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.600
Oh no.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.320
I'm so gullible.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.800
Oh, how about you two?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.840
Well, erm...

07:50.880 --> 07:53.280
I'm gonna...
oh, I'll tell her.

07:55.280 --> 07:59.360
Mag... sorry.
Maggie gave me a kidney.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.520
I was in hospital
visiting a friend

08:01.560 --> 08:04.600
and Donnie was in the next
bed on dialysis.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.000
thought he's cute.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.960
I thought she looked like
she had a kidney spare,
I'm kidding.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.640
And then,
six months later...

08:12.680 --> 08:14.280
- Should we?
- Yeah.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.080
- Ta-da!
- Look at that.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.600
Kidney twins.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.280
Aww...

08:26.320 --> 08:28.440
We are bound together, forever.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.200
- That's true, baby.
- Oh, my baba...

08:47.520 --> 08:49.920
This place used to be owned
by an Austrian woman

08:49.960 --> 08:53.200
who came here as a child
on the Kindertransport.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.960
When she died, she gifted
the whole house and everything
in it

08:56.000 --> 08:58.480
to the British government
as a way of saying thank you.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.040
I'm sure she'd be thrilled
with you manhandling
her crockery.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.960
Do you want to know
why I got into this job?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.800
Would a "no" deter you?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.920
I believe in what we do.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.720
And I know it might
surprise you to hear this,

09:18.760 --> 09:21.360
but I take pride in protecting
our country.

09:21.400 --> 09:26.400
Well, the good bits anyway,
not so much the eggy bits.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.320
And I do the unsavoury
things that we all have
to do

09:30.360 --> 09:33.760
because I believe that
they are necessary for
the greater good.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.640
But you...

09:38.600 --> 09:42.280
I think you love
the unsavoury.
You get off on the lying

09:42.320 --> 09:46.360
and the sneaking around
and the little nod to somebody
on a Monday morning

09:46.400 --> 09:48.280
that gets somebody
a thousand miles away killed.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.160
Aren't you even a tiny bit
ashamed of yourself?

09:58.080 --> 09:59.880
Unplug the listening devices.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.560
All of them.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.840
That's the lot.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.280
Your nice new girlfriend
from the Home Counties:
Melanie...

10:34.400 --> 10:37.520
is actually a Russian agent
from Vladivostok.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.080
- Bollocks.
- Oh I've seen a lot of those too, I really have.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.600
You hit her with a deluge
of penis portraits.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.600
She did move in with
you bizarrely quickly,
don't you think?

10:45.640 --> 10:48.800
Or maybe, someone with
your vanity wouldn't notice that.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.440
She's probably there now,
all alone, free to ransack
through your sordid little bits.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.520
Would you bring in my
bags before you...

11:10.440 --> 11:13.280
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm scared, I'm sacred.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.960
It's gonna be fine,
relax, relax.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.480
All right, all right,
just do it

11:17.800 --> 11:19.200
The moon.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.480
I love this card,
that's a really
mysterious card.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.640
Listen how to
trust your intuition, baba.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.920
- I think I might kill them.
- I think I'm gonna help you.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.360
Do you guys
want me to read your tarot?

11:34.400 --> 11:37.280
You totally should.
It's like she can see
into your soul.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.480
Okay.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.520
Perfect.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.640
So I'll do a simple
three card reading.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.360
The first card represents
the past, the second
the present

11:59.400 --> 12:01.960
and third the future.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.280
I'm complicated.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.560
Okay.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.040
The Tower. That speaks
of chaos and destruction
in your past.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.640
Can you think of
why that might be?

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
Let's have a look
at your present

12:23.240 --> 12:24.760
Mm. The Lovers.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.200
Normally, it would denote
unity, but the card is upside down

12:28.240 --> 12:30.320
so it speaks of the opposite.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.760
Is there any unresolved
conflict in your partnership?

12:36.200 --> 12:37.400
Do my future.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.960
The Sun.

12:43.880 --> 12:44.920
The Sun?

12:44.960 --> 12:47.560
That's one of the best cards
you can get.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.080
The Sun is magnificent
and holy.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.720
Whatever path you walk
down, you'll be blessed
with a celestial light.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.040
The Sun is life.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.840
Okay, you know what,
do my future.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.480
- Don't shove the Sun, Eve.
- Let's go.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.920
I can do you a three card
reading too...

13:03.960 --> 13:06.200
I don't want that. I just
want the future. The last one.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.880
Okay.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.960
Okay. What do you want?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.560
24 hours.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.200
And a taxi to Hampstead.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.880
They're just cards, Eve.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.000
- There's no such thing as fate.
- Really?

14:22.920 --> 14:24.000
What's this then?

14:25.920 --> 14:28.400
- You're a lot today.
- I'm a lot every day.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.560
One of her organs is inside
of him and they still can't
piss in front of each other.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.880
I wouldn't take it
too seriously.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.000
Hey, are you two okay
sharing a sleeping bag?

15:39.640 --> 15:40.680
What are you doing?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.880
Shall we steal their stupid
camper van?

16:42.880 --> 16:44.240
Yes.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.160
Oh, OK, so the nearest
truck stop isn't that far.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.760
Maybe they'll have
a phone charger.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.680
I can't believe
Helene's phone dies now.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.600
What do they even have
at truck stops?

17:14.440 --> 17:15.440
Trucks.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.560
Oh.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.320
Feed me one will you, honey?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.360
Sure thing, bubba.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.440
Ugh.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.840
Oh, did you get the coffee one?

17:49.880 --> 17:53.000
Yeah.
Mmm. Karma.

17:56.920 --> 17:57.960
Ugh.

18:11.480 --> 18:15.720

Oh, my God,
they do curly fries.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
Curly fries?

19:13.920 --> 19:14.920
What?

19:19.560 --> 19:20.560
Can I use this?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.080
Yes.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.480
Yes.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.080
This had better be good.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.480
I have 22 hours and I would
like to take The Twelve down
before supper time.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.160
Konstantin's dead.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.640
I killed him.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.960
With a pizza cutter.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.320
Is that it?

20:13.360 --> 20:15.240
He wanted me to tell you
he always loved you.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.480
And to give you this.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.720
You could've posted it.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.200
I just thought... Maybe...

20:54.040 --> 20:55.440
Well, now you've told me.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.400
Wait.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.160
You're a psychopath.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.120
I like mustard.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.200
It's messed up.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.640
I'm the psychopath?
Please...

21:24.000 --> 21:25.160
What?

21:31.320 --> 21:32.800
Go for it.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.760
Okay. We have the address.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.680
The Barn Swallow? Are you sure
this is the right location?

21:42.720 --> 21:44.600
It's what the postcard said.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.920
That's the pub by MI6,
the cheeky tossers.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.320
One time,
me and Bill were in there,

21:54.360 --> 21:57.120
and saw a man vomit
into his pint glass
and then drink it.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.280
Bill.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.440
You murdered him,
on a dance floor in Berlin.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.480
Of course.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.560
I remember Bill.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.920
So do I.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.040
What's your name?

22:23.080 --> 22:24.880
Pam.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.680
Pam,
I've made two discoveries
in the last year.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.760
Firstly, that I look exceptional
in linen.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.760
Really.
Truly unbeatable.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.880
And secondly,
that emotions or

22:40.600 --> 22:43.680
feelings as people apparently
like to call them nowadays,

22:43.720 --> 22:45.600
are at best an inconvenience

22:45.640 --> 22:49.520
and at worst a total scourge
on one's freedoms.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.640
Guilt and shame especially.
Don't let them take hold.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.280
This reminds me of my daughter.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.760
- So tranquil and serene.
- Is she?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.440
Oh, alive well,
just supremely irritating.

23:51.440 --> 23:56.000
Don't open your mouth.
Just seen a dead fox.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.560
Upstairs rooms are all empty.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.400
Cellar just had
a guy in there

26:49.440 --> 26:50.680
eating pickles
straight from the jar.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.160
How wretched.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Shall we go?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.240
Carolyn.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.280
How are you?

27:13.320 --> 27:15.440
- I miss Havana.
- Me too.

27:15.480 --> 27:19.120
The music, the dancing.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.080
The inebriated nudity.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.120
Could you two
- give us a moment?
- Mmm.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.760
Whatever muck you intend
to sling, please spare me.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.360
Actually,
I wanted to thank you.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.200
How disconcerting.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.360
If you hadn't spotted me
in that meeting

27:48.400 --> 27:51.680
the morning after
Bill's karaoke party,

27:51.720 --> 27:55.400
I wouldn't even be here.
I'd still be warming my tea
in the microwave.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.120
One of the great
unspoken truths of life, Eve,

28:02.160 --> 28:05.280
is that people behave exactly
as you expect them to.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.040
Take you, for example.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.640
You're about to embark
on some mad endgame

28:09.680 --> 28:12.000
when in fact
you know, deep down,
you're just a woman

28:12.040 --> 28:14.280
who likes an inappropriately
timed croissant,

28:14.320 --> 28:16.800
on a hungover Sunday morning.

28:16.840 --> 28:20.120
And you are going to
race me to it even though
you know, deep down,

28:20.160 --> 28:23.200
you don't have
an excuse anymore.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.880
You knew who killed Kenny,

28:24.920 --> 28:28.000
you just pretended not
so you could
keep playing the game.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.600
I was going to do that, yes.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.560
But now I'm going to behave
exactly as you'd expect me to,

28:40.840 --> 28:42.520
and do something different.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.800
I'm sorry about Konstantin.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.560
He's dead?

29:19.360 --> 29:22.800
Finally,
the head honchos
of The Twelve in one room.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.880
You can have this one, Eve.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
With my blessing.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.360
It's always been mine.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.840
Pamela.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.800
Change of plan,
we're going for a walk.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.200
They changed location.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.800
I owe you a dare.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.080
What's happening?
This can't be right.

30:11.800 --> 30:12.880
I mean,
it looks like a wedding.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
Let me see.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.880
Smart.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.360
They're here.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.400
We've got to get on
before it leaves.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.520
I don't know why
it's so popular.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.920
It's as if ice
had only just been invented.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.440
Did you want to
go up the London Eye?

30:45.960 --> 30:49.920
My information is no use
300 feet in the air,

30:49.960 --> 30:52.360
in a pod
of other people's flatulence.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.200
I see.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.560
Feeling homesick?

31:01.200 --> 31:02.640
Surprisingly, yes.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.520
But you don't
go back to MI6 empty handed.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.800
What's the plan?

31:10.640 --> 31:13.880
Whatever Eve and Villanelle
are gonna do, it's happening.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.400
Perhaps that's what
I wanted.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.840
You can't win the game
unless the game is on, can you?

31:25.840 --> 31:26.880
Who are you loyal to?

31:29.080 --> 31:32.440
Even loyalty
is a dubious virtue.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.200
Except when it's to me.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.920
Now, let's not
pussyfoot around.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.120
Do you want the job?

31:47.360 --> 31:48.360
No.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.800
Thanks for the coffee.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.720
- WOMAN 1: Hi there.
- WOMAN 2: Hi.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.160
How do we know
who the The Twelve is?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.680
We may just have to
kill them all.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.000
The boat's about to leave.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.120
That's everyone,
she's not here yet. Wait.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.160
Are you Natsuko?

32:37.800 --> 32:39.000
Yes.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.920
- Natsuko, thank God.
- Yes.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.720
- We've been calling you for ages.
- Oh.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.360
I thought I was going to have to
officiate my own wedding
for a moment there.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.040
We're starting now.
Come on. Great.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.120
Oh!

32:56.200 --> 32:57.440
Distract them.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.680
You look wonderful.
Just through here.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.520
You are a handsome man.

34:24.320 --> 34:28.840
You are also a handsome man.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.600
Together,

34:32.760 --> 34:33.760
you are,

34:36.840 --> 34:38.440
two handsome men,

34:40.640 --> 34:43.440
but also
so much more than that.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.200
Relationships...

34:54.680 --> 34:58.080
are a lot of work,
they require effort,

35:00.240 --> 35:01.880
and you will have tough times,

35:01.920 --> 35:04.520
sometimes you will feel like
you're losing your way,

35:04.560 --> 35:07.160
and sometimes you'll feel
like your losing each other

35:07.200 --> 35:10.480
but beauty in your relationship,

35:10.520 --> 35:13.480
will be found
in the ways you reunite.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.080
Have you ever heard of Kintsugi?

35:16.120 --> 35:21.000
Kintsugi is the Japanese
art form of gluing...

35:21.040 --> 35:22.360
Stay with me here. It's...

35:22.400 --> 35:26.040
It's a way of gluing broken pots
back together with gold.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.480
It actually strengthens the pot,

35:29.520 --> 35:34.880
It's a way of bonding,
to create something new,

35:37.480 --> 35:39.480
something completely your own.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.040
You may now kiss the groom.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.560

38:35.760 --> 38:38.280
Don't you mean, "We did it"?

38:38.320 --> 38:40.160
Yeah, but mostly me.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.800
Jump, Eve!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.840
Jolly good.
