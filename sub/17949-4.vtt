WEBVTT

00:09.610 --> 00:12.646
- AH, ANOTHER PERFECT DAY
AT THE PALMWOODS.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.715
- [gasps]
EXCEPT FOR THAT.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.421
- PARABOLIC MICROPHONE
NOW!

00:20.421 --> 00:21.822
[laugh track]

00:21.822 --> 00:22.890
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:22.890 --> 00:24.325
- SOUNDED AWFUL.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.526
- IT'S PROBABLY INTERFERENCE.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.627
JUST AIM.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.630
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD DATE SCIENCE,
THEN!

00:29.630 --> 00:32.266
[audience gasping]

00:32.266 --> 00:33.934
- SHH.

00:33.934 --> 00:37.037
- ALL I DID WAS CITE RECENT DATA
THAT CONCLUDED

00:37.037 --> 00:39.707
THAT OVEREXPOSURE WITH A PARTNER
OR SPOUSE

00:39.707 --> 00:41.342
INCREASES THE INCIDENTS
OF BREAK-UPS.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.643
- MM-HMM.
SMALL WORDS.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.644
- PLEASE.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.778
- I TOLD CAMILLE WE NEED

00:44.778 --> 00:46.314
TO LIMIT OUR DATES
TO TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.315
- MAKES SENSE.
- GENIUS.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.416
- DAT-A GOOD.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.950
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
SHE'S BEING DRAMATIC.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.253
I MEAN, WHAT IS SHE GONNA DO,
DATE SOMEONE ELSE?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.926
PARABOLIC MICROPHONE NOW!

00:58.926 --> 01:01.962
- SO SINCE I HATE EATING ALONE
AND YOU NEED THE EXPOSURE,

01:01.962 --> 01:03.464
HOW ABOUT DINNER
AT PAPARAZZI

01:03.464 --> 01:04.532
TONIGHT AT 8:00?

01:04.532 --> 01:05.633
- WHAT?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.701
- IT'S A DATE!

01:07.701 --> 01:08.969
- WHAT?

01:08.969 --> 01:10.871
- SO I GUESS SHE IS GOING
TO DATE SOMEONE ELSE.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.140
[laugh track]

01:12.140 --> 01:13.641
- QUIT, YOU.

01:13.641 --> 01:14.675
- JUST TURN IT DOWN.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.876
- WHY DOES IT KEEP DOING THAT?

01:15.876 --> 01:17.645
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

01:17.645 --> 01:19.447
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:19.447 --> 01:23.684
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME

01:23.684 --> 01:25.586
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:25.586 --> 01:27.288
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:27.288 --> 01:30.558
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME

01:30.558 --> 01:31.792
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:31.792 --> 01:33.527
- * HEY, HEY

01:33.527 --> 01:35.529
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW

01:35.529 --> 01:37.465
- * HEY, HEY

01:37.465 --> 01:39.633
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:39.633 --> 01:41.502
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:41.502 --> 01:43.471
* OH-OH, OH-OH

01:43.471 --> 01:44.972
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP

01:44.972 --> 01:47.308
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE

01:47.308 --> 01:48.876
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK

01:48.876 --> 01:51.345
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE

01:51.345 --> 01:55.183
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:55.183 --> 01:59.487
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:02.956 --> 02:04.658
- DUDE, CAMILLE JUST AGREED
TO GO ON A DATE--

02:04.658 --> 02:07.428
- AH! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA...

02:07.428 --> 02:08.429
- HE'S TAKING THIS WELL.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.530
- UH-HUH.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.299
- REHEARSAL IS CANCELED TODAY.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.500
- HOW COME?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.402
- BECAUSE GUSTAVO'S DOCTOR
ORDERED HIM

02:14.402 --> 02:16.003
TO TAKE A 24-HOUR BREAK
FROM THE THINGS

02:16.003 --> 02:17.505
THAT STRESS HIM OUT THE MOST.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.207
- OH, GRIFFIN?

02:19.207 --> 02:20.474
BUDGETS?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.709
WRITER'S BLOCK?

02:21.709 --> 02:24.212
- YOU, YOU, HIM,

02:24.212 --> 02:25.513
AND LOGAN!

02:25.513 --> 02:27.014
[beeping]

02:27.014 --> 02:29.350
- AH! HIS WATCH IS GONNA BLOW!

02:29.350 --> 02:31.285
- IT'S A BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR,

02:31.285 --> 02:32.786
AND IT GOES OFF
WHEN HE'S STRESSED,

02:32.786 --> 02:37.925
SO STAY AWAY FROM ME
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS!

02:40.060 --> 02:41.229
- NO REHEARSAL?

02:41.229 --> 02:44.232
- THAT MEANS I'M FREE
TO GO OUT...

02:44.232 --> 02:45.533
WITH A JENNIFER.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.781
LATER, BOYS.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.616
- YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT HAVE
A SHOT THIS TIME.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.918
- UNTIL HE BURP ASKS HER OUT

03:04.918 --> 03:08.155
OR GIVES HER A GIFT,
WHICH WILL BE A FROG.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.258
- I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.092
FRIENDSHIP POWERS ACTIVATE!

03:12.092 --> 03:13.627
[lightning strikes]

03:17.265 --> 03:18.266
- HEY.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.500
- HEY.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.569
- HEY?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.804
- HEY!

03:23.804 --> 03:26.774
- HEY!

03:26.774 --> 03:28.676
- LADIES?

03:35.115 --> 03:37.318
- HEY, GIRLS.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.288
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

03:40.288 --> 03:43.891
WE SHOULD ALL GO OUT
AND TALK ABOUT OUR TOP TEN HIT--

03:43.891 --> 03:44.992
OH, WAIT.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.294
I'M BUSY TONIGHT.

03:46.294 --> 03:50.130
BUT CARLOS IS FREE,
RED DRESS JENNIFER.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.599
- [scoffs]

03:51.599 --> 03:53.734
UM, SURE.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.403
- GREAT. HE'LL SEE YOU
IN THE LOBBY AT 6:00.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.637
- HUH?

03:58.739 --> 04:02.443
- LOOK, I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF GETTING A DATE MYSELF.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.644
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.979
I'M JUST TRYING TO PLAY WING MAN
FOR MY BEST BUD.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.449
- WELL, THANK YOU, BUD,

04:08.449 --> 04:10.418
BUT I CAN HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.552
- I'LL HANG ONTO IT.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.586
- GIVE ME MY HELMET, MAN.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.621
- LET ME HAVE IT.

04:13.621 --> 04:14.788
- GIVE ME MY HELMET!

04:14.788 --> 04:16.690
- SURE.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.730
- HIT ME AGAIN.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.232
LOOK, IT'S JUST TIME
TO FACE THE FACTS.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.670
CAMILLE AND I ARE JUST
TOO DIFFERENT, OKAY?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.339
I BASE DECISIONS OFF LOGIC,

04:31.339 --> 04:33.774
AND CAMILLE THINKS MY LOGIC
IS STUPID.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.909
- OKAY, BUT YOU KNOW
THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING

04:35.909 --> 04:37.244
AS THE PERFECT GIRLFRIEND.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.413
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD
WITH THE--

04:39.413 --> 04:40.781
- BOO!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.816
- WELL, THEN, MR. LOGIC,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.485
INVENT THE PERFECT GIRLFRIEND?

04:44.485 --> 04:45.953
- [chuckles]

04:45.953 --> 04:48.822
[harps cascading]

04:48.822 --> 04:51.058
- GREETINGS, LOGAN,

04:51.058 --> 04:53.894
YOU ARE SMART AND HOT
LIKE ME.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.696
LET'S GO ON A DATE.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.797
- [laughs]

04:56.797 --> 04:59.032
IT WORKED.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.033
IS IT TOO WEIRD?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.402
- COMPLETELY.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.571
- BUT IMPRESSIVE.

05:03.571 --> 05:04.905
- I KNOW.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.374
GO ON SCIENCEMATCH.DATE

05:06.374 --> 05:08.609
AND SEARCH
FOR THE PERFECT GIRLFRIEND.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.478
ONE THAT'S JUST LIKE ME.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.779
JUST NOT A ROBOT.

05:11.779 --> 05:12.780
- WHAT?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.281
- NOTHING.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.085
- WELL, I'M GONNA GO SEARCH
FOR LUCY

05:18.085 --> 05:21.689
BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY RUDE
TO ME IN THE LOBBY.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.256
- WAIT, WHAT ABOUT THE--

05:23.256 --> 05:25.426
- I WILL NEVER LOVE AGAIN.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.462
GET ME CHOCOLATE.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.932
[elevator bell dings]

05:39.773 --> 05:42.976
- OH, MY GOD.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.011
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.779
- NO WAY.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.314
- IF YOU DON'T,
I'M GONNA RIP OUT YOUR--

05:47.314 --> 05:48.749
MOM, DAD, HI.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.283
- LUCILLE.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.853
- I MISSED MY GIRL.

05:54.087 --> 05:58.225
OH, IS THIS A FRIEND
FROM THE CONSERVATORY?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.259
- YES.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.028
THIS IS KENDALL,

06:01.028 --> 06:03.263
WHO STUDIES CLASSICAL MUSIC,

06:03.263 --> 06:04.297
JUST LIKE ME.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.666
[chuckles]

06:05.666 --> 06:07.435
- YEP.
THAT'S ME.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.537
HER CONSERVATORY FRIEND.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.905
- WELL, THEN YOU MUST GIVE US
A TOUR

06:11.905 --> 06:14.708
OF THIS OFF-CAMPUS RESIDENCE
THAT YOU ALL LIVE IN.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.809
- NO.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.678
MOM, KENDALL HAS TO STUDY

06:17.678 --> 06:19.880
FOR A TEST TOMORROW,
AND--

06:19.880 --> 06:22.650
- WOULD LOVE TO GIVE YOU A TOUR.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.351
LET'S START IN THE PARK.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.453
- P FOR PEACHY.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.588
[laughter]

06:32.325 --> 06:34.695
- HEY, SOMEBODY'S LOOKING SHARP.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.329
- UH-HUH.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.966
I'VE GOT A BIG DATE,
SO I GOT TO DRESS BIG, RIGHT?

06:38.966 --> 06:41.635
- [chuckling]
YEAH, YOU DO.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.803
- OH.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.705
AH.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.106
- OOPS, SORRY.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.575
- JAMES!

06:47.575 --> 06:49.076
- EPIC JUICE BOX FAIL.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.311
- NOW I HAVE TO CHANGE.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.880
[grunts]

06:54.014 --> 06:56.817
HMM?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.351
- WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

06:58.351 --> 07:01.489
- OH, JUST SAVING CARLOS' DATE
WITH RED DRESS JENNIFER?

07:01.489 --> 07:02.756
- IMPOSSIBLE.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.758
SHE'S TOO CLASSY,
AND HE'S TOO CARLOS.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.895
- GREAT.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.731
NOW I HAVE TO WEAR
THIS STUPID OUTFIT.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.504
- SO, BUD, WHERE ARE YOU TAKING
THE FUTURE MRS. GARCIA?

07:16.504 --> 07:18.672
- WELL, IN MY HANDS RIGHT HERE

07:18.672 --> 07:21.141
I HAVE DIRECTIONS
AND RESERVATIONS

07:21.141 --> 07:24.978
TO THE NEAREST SLOPPY CHEESE.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.714
THERE'S PIZZA, PRIZES,

07:26.714 --> 07:28.048
AND A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.049
- MM-HMM.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.084
- SWEET.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.322
WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE
THOSE RESERVATIONS

07:35.322 --> 07:36.924
AND GO ON THE DATE
WITH CARLOS.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.325
- CAN I BRING MY NEW SLINGSHOT?

07:38.325 --> 07:39.527
- SURE.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.894
WE MIGHT NEED IT.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.195
- ACCORDING TO HER PROFILE,

07:42.195 --> 07:44.131
SHE HAS AN IQ OF 130,

07:44.131 --> 07:47.100
LIKES MATH HOMEWORK,
CROSSWORDS, AND TOAST.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.401
- GREAT.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.402
WHY AM I HERE?

07:49.402 --> 07:51.038
- BECAUSE IF SHE'S A WEIRDO,

07:51.038 --> 07:53.440
I NEED MY MOM TO GROUND ME.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.376
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.081
HI. ARE YOU LINDSAY?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.049
- YEAH, HI.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.283
SORRY I'M LATE.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.553
WHILE ON MY BIKE,
I MET STRONG EASTERLY HEADWINDS,

08:05.553 --> 08:06.687
PROBABLY DUE TO--

08:06.687 --> 08:10.157
both: A DISTURBANCE
IN THE LOWER IONOSPHERE.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.593
- LOGAN MITCHELL,
I AM YOUR MOTHER.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.563
YOU ARE GROUNDED, MISTER.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.264
- OKAY, UM...

08:17.264 --> 08:19.399
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.435
- DON'T YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
WEIRD ABOUT HER?

08:22.435 --> 08:24.638
OR FAMILIAR?

08:25.639 --> 08:26.874
- UM, I THINK SHE'S CUTE

08:26.874 --> 08:28.576
AND WE HAVE
AN AWESOME CONNECTION.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.912
- YEAH, YOU HAVE
A BIG CONNECTION.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.881
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR DATE.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.216
- NOT GROUNDED.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.651
[chuckles]

08:38.786 --> 08:40.654
- UM, WHO IS THAT?

08:40.654 --> 08:43.290
- OOH, CAMILLE, UH,
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.291
THIS IS LINDSAY.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.894
WE'RE GOING ON A DATE TONIGHT.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.061
- SO ARE WE.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.196
AT CHEZ FANCE-AY.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.264
IT'S GONNA BE A CHEZ PARTAY.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.333
- OH, WELL, MAYBE WE
SHOULD DOUBLE DATE.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.035
RECENT DATA CITES
THAT DOUBLE DATING

08:55.035 --> 08:56.236
EASES FIRST DATE JITTERS

08:56.236 --> 08:57.805
AND FOSTERS SOCIAL INTERACTION.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.608
- WELL, I KNOW
LOGAN LOVES DATA.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.109
- AND I KNOW THAT CAMILLE
LOVES DATING.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.711
- AND I KNOW I LOVE PEOPLE
LOOKING AT ME.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.412
SO LET'S MEET HERE AT 6:00?

09:05.412 --> 09:07.314
both: IT'S A DATE!

09:11.218 --> 09:12.319
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.888
- I LOVE DOUBLE DATES.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.790
- AND AS WE CONCLUDE OUR TOUR,

09:16.790 --> 09:19.059
PLEASE HELP YOURSELF
TO SOME COMPLIMENTARY

09:19.059 --> 09:20.928

MY PARENTS

THEY THINK I'M IN L.A.
IN A VIOLIN SCHOLARSHIP.

IF THEY FOUND THAT I DYED

BUT RECENT DATA STATES

16:21.748 --> 16:23.483
THAT YOU SHOULD ONLY EAT IT

IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING,

17:45.665 --> 17:46.833
