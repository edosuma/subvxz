<i> organizing is a practice.</i>

00:15.141 --> 00:16.557
<i> And like with any practice,</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:19.184
<i> we can't only be in it</i>
<i> for the results.</i>

00:19.270 --> 00:21.186
<i> We have to find meaning</i>
<i> in the mission.</i>

00:21.272 --> 00:24.565
<i> Otherwise, we'll just give up</i>
<i> when things get messy again.</i>

00:24.650 --> 00:28.485
<i> The act of organizing</i>
<i> has to feel essential.</i>

00:28.571 --> 00:32.197
<i> Something that makes us</i>
<i> feel alive, in control.</i>

00:32.241 --> 00:33.449
<i> Our things take on meaning</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:36.618
by how and where we keep them,
right?

00:36.704 --> 00:40.456
So if you think about it,
tidying creates value,

00:40.541 --> 00:43.417
<i> it's not just</i>
<i> a means to an end.</i>

00:43.502 --> 00:46.378
<i> Tidy makes meaning.</i>

00:46.422 --> 00:50.299
<i> Don't just like the look,</i>
<i> love the process.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:53.635
And now, back to this week's
organizing challenge.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.734
becca, you scared me.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.653
I was wondering what
you were doing here so late.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.404
Wait, how did you know
I was here?

01:54.448 --> 01:57.574
I have that tracker
on your phone, remember?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.660
Since you insisted in case
I can't get a hold of you

01:59.745 --> 02:01.245
and I need
the client's address...

02:01.330 --> 02:04.540
Right. Wait,
why are you here so late?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.667
Have you ever tried
to stay ahead of you?

02:06.752 --> 02:07.876
-[zipper zips]
-how was yoga?

02:07.962 --> 02:10.337
It's about as productive
as our calendar.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.422
You know once I get started,
it's hard for me to stop.

02:12.508 --> 02:15.342
Meels, are you too afraid
to go home?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.636
Did you know who created
a new user account?

02:17.721 --> 02:20.806
Same name. New numbers.
He's a creep.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.684
I'll block him over and over
again if I have to.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.770
Seriously? This has to stop.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.397
You need help
moderating the comments

02:28.482 --> 02:31.275
before they hit the blog.
I'm happy to do it.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.528
I am not going to let some troll
dictate how I work.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.739
Chaos is not some random troll.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.576
You have to draw the line
at getting stalked,

02:40.661 --> 02:43.745
being threatened.
I mean, you said it yourself.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.331
You saw someone outside
many times.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.500
And that's exactly why you
shouldn't be here by yourself,

02:48.544 --> 02:49.835
especially, late at night.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.422
Thank you.
But let me take care of me.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.508
It's my job to take care of you.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.678
Oh. Speaking of, they came
for you. It looks personal.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.314
-There's no return address.
-Mm-mm.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.237
It's from
my ex-boyfriend's wife.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.364
Is that a good thing?

03:19.450 --> 03:21.617
What does it say? Read it.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.703
"dear amelia, you're going
to think I'm insane.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.831
It's liv.
I'm married to mark callahan.

03:27.875 --> 03:32.502
I realize we've never met,
but I've heard a lot about you.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.546
I'm terminally sick,
and I'm writing

03:34.632 --> 03:38.550
because I know what
you and mark had was special.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.761
I don't know
if he'll recover after I go,

03:40.846 --> 03:43.972
and I'm realizing now
that my dying wish

03:44.058 --> 03:46.516
is for you to be there
for him..."

03:48.812 --> 03:52.314
"that maybe you can give him
a happily ever after,

03:52.399 --> 03:55.776
someone else to live for,
or some hope at least.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.402
He so desperately needs it.

03:57.488 --> 04:00.697
I pray this finds you well
and open-minded.

04:00.783 --> 04:04.243
It would mean the world,
even just a hello.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.702
Sincerely, liv."

04:05.788 --> 04:09.665
it's kind of romantic,
in a morbid way.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.542
Some terminal woman
asks her husband's ex

04:12.586 --> 04:17.381
to get back with him?
It's so selfless and awful.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.468
Clearly, she thinks
something's there. Is there?

04:21.553 --> 04:24.513
-We were together in college.
-Was he your first love?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.556
Yeah, very much in love.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.976
-And then?
-And then my mom got sick.

04:29.061 --> 04:33.480
I dropped out to take care
of her, and I just left.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.941
-I didn't tell him.
-Oh.

04:36.026 --> 04:40.946
I know, it's the worst thing
I've ever done to someone.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.448
But I knew
if I had to tell him...

04:44.785 --> 04:46.702
I wouldn't be able to go.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.871
Honestly, I'm surprised she
thinks I'm so special to him.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.041
I figured he'd hate me by now.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.752
-And you never saw him again?
-No.

04:55.838 --> 04:59.423
I started squirrel
right after my mom died.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.384
Obviously, I threw myself
into my work...

05:03.595 --> 05:05.721
What would I even say to him?

05:07.141 --> 05:08.557

hooks are your friend

No more prying spatulas
out of a crammed drawer.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.750
-Why didn't I think of that?
-It's easy to get stuck.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.419
That's what you hired me for.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.088
Well, that,
and I am your biggest fan.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.799
Aww. Thank you.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.717
Actually, I was gonna talk
to you about maybe coming over

07:07.803 --> 07:09.136
again this weekend,
perhaps helping me

07:09.221 --> 07:10.971
with my wine collection?

07:11.056 --> 07:14.433
That rack is just, it's
too cluttered for the space.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.518
We could drink some wine,
you could tell me

07:16.603 --> 07:18.478
all about your business venture.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.564
I might even wanna invest,
you never know.

07:20.649 --> 07:24.025
Thank you. But maybe next week?

07:24.111 --> 07:27.028
This weekend
is a bit tough for me.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.574
And, actually, I have
to leave soon for a funeral.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.952
Oh. I, I'm so sorry.
I-I didn't know, I...

07:33.996 --> 07:36.788
It's okay.
Have you seen my assistant?

07:36.832 --> 07:41.042
And I just love using
mason jars as desk organizers.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.670
[becca] they're super rustic,
easy to clean.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.130
You can put paperclips in them.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.798
There you are.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.428
Nice work in here. Good job.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.930
-Thanks.
-We gotta go.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.057
Now? Your next thing's
not until 2:00.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.268
Shoot. I forgot.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.896
-Who's that with?
-That new client I found.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.440
Forrest jacobs.
I think you're gonna like him.

08:03.525 --> 08:07.736
Can we push? I forgot to tell
you it's liv's funeral today.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.906
-You're actually going?
-I guess so.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.949
Good for you.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.660
Well, why don't you go ahead
and I'll finish up here

08:15.704 --> 08:17.787
and maybe I can even start
on the basement?

08:17.873 --> 08:21.583
I don't think you're ready to be
at a client's alone just yet.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.126
You have to earn client trust.

08:23.212 --> 08:28.006
And, uh...
Gwyneth is a bit particular.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.550
I'd feel better
if we came back together.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.260
-Okay.
-Okay.

[clears throat]

08:37.851 --> 08:39.142
[sighs]

08:39.228 --> 08:41.603
liv loved to write.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.190
One of her favorite things to do
was to reflect on the world

08:45.275 --> 08:46.233
and put it on paper.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.902
As her condition got worse,

08:48.987 --> 08:54.032
she couldn't go outside,
so she wrote them to me even.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.368
Called them
<i> postcards from the bedposts.</i>

08:57.913 --> 08:59.871
I'd like to read one.

09:02.793 --> 09:06.586
"dear mark,
the weather here is stunning.

09:06.672 --> 09:10.840
And the views of our yard,
you wouldn't believe.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.301
There's this really cute guy
here who brings me food

09:13.387 --> 09:17.681
and makes the bed.
He kind of does everything.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.017
I can tell that he's sad,
and I wish I knew

09:21.103 --> 09:23.144
how to cheer him up, but I'm
afraid I might be the reason

09:23.230 --> 09:25.897
why he feels that way.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.148
I miss you.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.026
I wish you were here."

09:34.950 --> 09:38.159
I never got to give this to her.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.998
"dear liv, I'm so glad
you're being taken care of.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.000
But one thing I know for sure,

09:45.085 --> 09:49.045
there's no world
where you make someone sad.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.673
I'd say,
the guy helping you is just...

09:53.927 --> 09:56.219
Is just afraid of the day
that you have to leave.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.265
But until then,
he's the luckiest man alive."

10:01.768 --> 10:03.101
I love you.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.110
[indistinct chatter]

10:12.195 --> 10:14.070
I can't believe it.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.280
How did you...

10:21.288 --> 10:23.913
-That was beautiful, mark.
-How did you know about this?

10:23.999 --> 10:27.751
Uh, I saw the obituary.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.252
I'm so sorry.

10:29.338 --> 10:32.380
Do you live nearby?
I didn't know we were so close.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.842
Yeah. Crazy coincidence, right?

10:35.927 --> 10:37.761
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm liv's sister.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.348
-Do we know you?
-Vicki, this is amelia.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.309
-An old college friend.
-Amelia? Oh.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.935
Did you know my sister?

10:46.021 --> 10:48.188
I did not, unfortunately.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.939
But I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.901
Yeah. Same.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.403
Look, you and I still need to
talk about some things alone.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.863
Can we talk about this later,
vick--

10:56.948 --> 10:58.156
her little safe.
I have the extra key.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.366
You know
she wanted me to have it.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.284
-I'm sorry, vi--
-I can go upstairs.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.994
Right now and get it.
I know exactly where it is.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.663
I will bring you
whatever you want.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.248
I just need some time, okay?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.333
Fine.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.838
[sighs] sorry about that.
She can be a bit intense.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.340
I think she's struggling
with money and she thinks

11:15.425 --> 11:17.676
liv has some sort of nest egg,

11:17.761 --> 11:20.428
but it's not true.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.431
Well, it is a hell of a lot
to go through, though.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.476
Uh, maybe I can help with that.

11:30.482 --> 11:33.274
I've worked
with grieving clients.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.985
I know it can be hard,
going through everything.

11:36.071 --> 11:40.198
I'd love to help you, whenever,
free of charge.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.784
That's my cell.

11:42.869 --> 11:46.121
Thank you, really.
And for coming.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.960
Uh, I should go.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.920
-It's really good to see you.
-Yeah.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.463
Means a lot.

Nice blog post you put up
without

12:37.382 --> 12:39.382
talking to me about it first.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.761
People were asking
for a post on desk space.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.888
And you thought I'd be okay
with you posting

12:44.931 --> 12:46.431

Recording a client's house
without permission?

What did I say
about client relationships?

You said "clear the day."
and I didn't wanna bother you.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.485
I swear,
I was just trying to help.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.530
Okay, but I need you
to do your job, not mine.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.074
And especially,
not without asking.

I'm sorry, but it's really
frustrating sometimes.

I've been your assistant
for three years.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.876
And when you hired me, you said
that there was room for growth.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.377
You went about this
the wrong way.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.587
[scoffs]

13:24.346 --> 13:26.221
look, I'm sorry.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.139
I love your ambition.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.351

suffocate that.

But squirrel is my baby.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.440
I get that, but I care about it

13:37.484 --> 13:40.401
and have put a lot of time
into this company, too.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.071
I have hundreds of ideas.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.365
I think I could bring something
really great to the table.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.992
I know you can be more, becca.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.912
But now's just not that time.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.872
Not after that blog post.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.123
[sighs]

13:56.211 --> 13:58.503
or maybe you're just mad
that people actually liked

13:58.547 --> 14:01.297
what I had to say,
or that miraculously,

14:01.383 --> 14:04.300
squirrel didn't crash and burn
when you were away for a day.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.094
Are you serious with me
right now?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.262
[scoffs]

14:12.143 --> 14:15.353
there. It's deleted. I'm sorry.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.438
I'm gonna work
the rest of the day from home.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.399
Why don't you take a half day
in the morning

14:19.484 --> 14:23.111
to think about what you did
and what you just said to me?

14:32.581 --> 14:33.496
[cell phone beeps]

14:33.582 --> 14:36.541
[intense music]

14:50.682 --> 14:53.224
[intense music]

14:54.102 --> 14:55.727
[sniffing]

15:07.365 --> 15:08.489
[gasps]

15:15.624 --> 15:16.748
[door opens]

15:18.752 --> 15:20.585
I hear someone found
a dead animal in a drawer?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.170
Oh...

15:28.553 --> 15:30.178
Thank you so much for coming.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.305
I really didn't know
who else to call.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.934
Here I thought I'd be the one
helping you, and now this.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.560
Don't worry about it,
I'm grateful

15:37.646 --> 15:39.312
to get out of the house
for a minute.

15:39.397 --> 15:44.108
I've, uh, barely
moved at all lately.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.152
So what's the deal
with this creep?

15:46.237 --> 15:48.237
Chaos, we call him.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.282
Or that's what
he calls himself online.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.076
He's been at it on the blog
for a while,

15:53.161 --> 15:56.496
but this is the first time it's
crossed over into real life.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.958
-Hm.
-At least, I think.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.502
My assistant thinks
I'm being watched.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.254
-You're being watched?
-Maybe now I agree.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.298
I'm happy to help you
at home, too.

16:07.384 --> 16:11.719
Thanks.
So, pretty gruesome, huh?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.430
Be glad it was a squirrel
and not you.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.391
So who else has access
to this space?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.060
Uh, becca, my assistant, and me.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.980
There was no sign of break-in?

16:22.065 --> 16:25.233
-No.
-And you trust your assistant?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.652
-Of course.
-Where is she now?

16:27.737 --> 16:30.989
Well, normally she'd be here,
but we got into

16:31.074 --> 16:34.158
a bit of a disagreement
yesterday.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.618
You should get your locks
changed.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.453
Maybe hold on to the keys
yourself.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.497
-Mm-hmm.
-You're taking the right steps.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.458
But these things
tend to escalate.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.420
Keep an eye
on who tries to get close.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.255
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.757
-[man] hello!
-Hi.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.759
-Hi.
-Can I help you?

16:51.845 --> 16:55.388
I have a 10:30. Forrest jacobs.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.599
Right. It's 10:30 already. Wow.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.101
-Would you like me to wait? I--
-no!

17:00.186 --> 17:01.310
Um...

17:03.106 --> 17:05.189
-Amelia sommers.
-Oh, pleasure. Hi.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.566
-Conference room?
-Great, yes.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.359
Here, I'll get the door.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.709
So, tell me everything.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.086
-Okay. Everything?
-Mm-hmm.

17:27.172 --> 17:30.381
Okay, how do I put this? Um...

17:30.467 --> 17:35.511
I feel, I-I feel a bit haunted
in my own home.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.390
Yeah, by, um, by different
versions of myself

17:39.434 --> 17:42.602
that, uh,
that I've never become.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.687
And by that you mean...

17:44.773 --> 17:47.190
Okay, for example,
uh, at one point

17:47.275 --> 17:49.776
I wanted to become a painter,
so I bought a stack of canvasses

17:49.861 --> 17:52.779
and all the colors
of the acrylics.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.280
That didn't happen.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.116
Uh, same way
I tried gourmet cooking.

17:57.202 --> 18:01.412
Uh, pottery,
photography, karate.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.082
And now it's just, it's,

18:04.167 --> 18:07.210
this is all there
squatting all day.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.546
-And what do you actually do?
-I'm a publisher. Uh...

18:10.632 --> 18:13.216
Yeah, provide a pipeline
for the real experts.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.677
You could say
that without someone like you,

18:16.763 --> 18:19.430
no one would be able to explore
their curiosities.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.600
-That's something.
-Wow.

18:22.685 --> 18:26.062
I, I didn't know this, uh, came
with therapy.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.563
-[laughs]
-thank you for that.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.066
-Or is that extra?
-Organizing digs deep.

18:30.151 --> 18:34.112
Yeah. Good thing
I have a lot of shovels.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.115
Oh, it's a gardening phase.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.744
Well, I would love to help you
make space for yourself.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.664
-The real you.
-The real me.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.291
[instrumental music]

18:58.596 --> 19:00.221
[cell phone beeps]

19:02.308 --> 19:05.143
[intense music]

19:15.238 --> 19:16.612
thanks.

19:16.698 --> 19:20.867
I'm sorry for the no-show
yesterday afternoon.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.452
I needed a full day
to really move past it.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.581
There was a dead squirrel in my
desk drawer yesterday morning.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.624
What?

19:28.710 --> 19:32.170
-Are you okay?
-I don't know.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.173
-I didn't sleep last night.
-Do you think it was him?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.383
Who? Chaos?

19:37.468 --> 19:40.178
Yeah. I do.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.346
Well, maybe it's time
to start taking action

19:42.390 --> 19:46.225
against this psycho, like
I've suggested a hundred times.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.520
Start moderating your website.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.273
I offered to help.
My offer stands.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.444
Wait, how did you get in here?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.404
I had the locks changed
yesterday.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.907
I thought my key felt weird
when I came in.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.910
But it wasn't locked.
It was open.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.661
Anyway, you probably
just left it open

20:05.705 --> 20:07.580
when you came in this morning.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.833
But, you know, we might need
more than new locks

20:10.919 --> 20:12.460
if you wanna stop someone
twisted enough

20:12.545 --> 20:14.879
to leave a dead squirrel
in your desk.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.682
-Hello.
-[amelia] hi.

20:26.768 --> 20:30.728
-Uh, amelia and...
-Becca, my assistant.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.271
I believe
you guys spoke already?

20:32.357 --> 20:36.192
Oh. Sorry.
Uh, yes, we, we emailed.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.610
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.571
Um, I-I was just expecting you.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.698
I'm admittedly ocd,
uh, about guests,

20:42.784 --> 20:44.617
you know, considering the mess.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.911
Of course.
Will you give us a minute?

20:46.955 --> 20:49.580
-Sure.
-Thanks.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.792
It's fine. I'll be fine.
I'll wait out here.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.295
I'm so sorry.
Can I buy you dinner?

20:56.381 --> 20:59.632
I know you don't wanna talk
about us, but I do.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.342
You don't deserve this.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.636
And you're right. I do need you.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.389
And I don't wanna lose you.

21:06.474 --> 21:10.434
Not as a colleague,
and especially not as a friend.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.228
Would you mind
just waiting here?

21:12.313 --> 21:15.856
-No, it's okay.
-Okay. I won't be long.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.360
Great. Hi.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.946
-Can I take your bag or...
-Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.784
Here we are.

21:29.872 --> 21:33.207
[laughs] I've never been
in a client's house

21:33.293 --> 21:34.583
that's neater than mine.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.585
I thought you said
this place was a mess.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.046
Um, are you not seeing
the amount of useless things

21:39.132 --> 21:40.464
in the house?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.717
Yeah, but it's all so tidy.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.344
Well, thank you, uh...

21:45.430 --> 21:47.972
Are those nunchucks?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.599
[forrest] why, yes.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.269
Part of your karate phase?

21:53.313 --> 21:54.645
-Hm.
-Yeah.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.439
[amelia chuckles]

21:56.524 --> 21:58.607
oh, I love those shelves.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.318
I featured them
on my blog once.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.778
Yeah, you'll, you'll see
a lot of squirrel around here.

22:02.864 --> 22:03.946
I've been following you
for a little while.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.449
Just a bit of a lurker.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.868
Oh. That's nice.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.954
You didn't mention that
in our meeting yesterday.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.831
Oh, I... Should I have?

22:13.916 --> 22:16.083
No. No, it's fine.

22:16.169 --> 22:19.837
So where is this
overstocked book collection

22:19.881 --> 22:20.921
you talked about?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.841
Yes. It's, um, out back.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.676
-I'll show you the way.
-Okay.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.850
Uh, most of these I've published
or they're by authors

22:32.935 --> 22:35.895
I've published
or hope to someday at least.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.731
-Are they all non-fiction?
-Advice and self-help.

22:38.816 --> 22:42.109
Some academic and, um, crafts.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.196
Hence the hobbies.
And I dabble in memoir as well.

22:48.159 --> 22:51.535
-What's this about?
-Oh, well, wow.

22:53.664 --> 22:57.541
[exhales]
here. You take it.

22:57.627 --> 23:01.837
It's a beautiful and soulful
meditation on calligraphy.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.839
-Calligraphy.
-Yes.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.384
You'll love it.
You'll weep on it, I swear.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.972
Maybe you don't feel like
yourself in here

23:12.058 --> 23:14.767
because you've kept what you are
out here.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.144
All this needs to come inside.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.772
You need to be surrounded
by your books.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.941
You just gasped
and clutched your heart

23:22.026 --> 23:23.651
at the mention of calligraphy.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.111
-I did, didn't I? Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.072
I can't imagine what
these other books do to you.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.533
[exhales]
uh, uh... Okay.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.034
-Right?
-You might be right.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.869
We've got our work
cut out for us.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.037
-Yeah, we do.
-Mm-hmm.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.747
-Where do we start?
-Hm.

23:38.709 --> 23:42.753
You're important to me, becca.
I don't wanna fail you.

23:42.839 --> 23:46.006
And you're right, I have
prioritized everyone in my life

23:46.092 --> 23:48.884
when you're the one
who's cared about me the most.

23:48.970 --> 23:53.055
Okay. Well,
now I can't be mad.

23:53.141 --> 23:56.392
It's just, after all this time,
I feel like I'm only

23:56.436 --> 23:58.686
three things for you at work,

23:58.771 --> 24:01.897
your assistant, not good enough

24:01.941 --> 24:03.816
and a threat.

24:03.901 --> 24:08.112
And that hurts,
especially since we're friends.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.949
I am so sorry. This is mark.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.577
-He wants me to come over.
-Did you hear what I said?

24:14.662 --> 24:16.203
Just one sec, bec.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.624
[sighs]
okay.

24:22.587 --> 24:25.588
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

24:25.673 --> 24:27.798
How about we hire an assistant
for both of us

24:27.842 --> 24:30.801
so I can start taking on sales,
marketing strategies,

24:30.845 --> 24:32.595
and ways to help us grow?

24:32.680 --> 24:34.847
And maybe even a couple
of commercial clients, too?

24:34.932 --> 24:37.183
I guess I need to look at that
prospectus you made still,

24:37.268 --> 24:42.062
but I was thinking
in the meantime, like,

24:42.148 --> 24:45.608
maybe we start a becca page
and you can do your thing there.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.694
Do my thing on a becca page?

24:48.779 --> 24:50.905
Yeah, that could be fun, right?

24:50.990 --> 24:54.783
-Like, a way to get your feet--
-you know what? Forget it.

24:54.827 --> 24:58.704
I gotta get home.
You do your thing.

24:58.789 --> 24:59.997
Becca, wait.

25:11.761 --> 25:12.843
[sighs]

25:14.847 --> 25:16.013
[thuds]

25:32.823 --> 25:34.031
[latch clicks]

25:34.075 --> 25:36.617
[intense music]

25:36.702 --> 25:38.118
[gasps]
who's there?

25:42.625 --> 25:43.874
Hello?

25:46.796 --> 25:49.296
[door opens]

25:49.382 --> 25:52.216
[music continues]

26:06.399 --> 26:07.731
[music continues]

26:09.110 --> 26:10.734
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:12.238 --> 26:14.989
and you don't know
who's harassing you online?

26:15.074 --> 26:18.242
Who left this dead squirrel,
you say, in your office?

26:18.286 --> 26:21.036
-I have no idea.
-No angry clients?

26:21.122 --> 26:24.164
-Perhaps, an angry employee?
-No.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.125
-None that I can think of.
-Okay, then.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.793
We'll talk to your neighbors
in the a.M.,

26:27.878 --> 26:29.587
see what they heard or saw.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.547
In the meantime, let us know
if anything comes to mind

26:31.632 --> 26:34.633
or if you find
that something's missing.

26:34.719 --> 26:37.845
You okay?
You want us to call anyone?

26:37.930 --> 26:40.306
No. I'm okay.

26:40.391 --> 26:43.601
All right.
Get those locks changed.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.978
And maybe think about getting
a security system

26:46.063 --> 26:47.187
or an alarm, would you?

26:47.273 --> 26:50.190
Of course. Thank you, detective.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.623
[cell phone ringing]

27:10.671 --> 27:12.588
-hello?
-Hey.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.798
I'm sorry. I know
I said I'd leave you alone.

27:14.884 --> 27:17.092
No. It's-it's okay.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.803
Are you all right?

27:19.889 --> 27:21.972
I'm sitting outside my house.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.183
I can't go inside.

27:24.268 --> 27:27.019
-It's too quiet in there.
-Of course.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.896
[mark]<i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i> You hardly know me now.</i>

27:28.981 --> 27:31.148
-Is this weird?
-No.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.026
I'm actually glad you called.

27:34.111 --> 27:37.154
Are you okay? You sound upset.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.822
You don't need to hear this.

27:38.866 --> 27:42.076
No, it's fine. What's wrong?

27:42.161 --> 27:45.037
There was an intruder
in my house tonight.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.289
The police just left.

27:47.375 --> 27:51.627
I'm literally sitting
in my kitchen terrified.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.045
I don't even think I can move.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.172
Hang tight, all right?
I'll be there in a second.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.925
No, no, you don't
have to do that, please.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.178
It's too late. I'm already on my
way. Just text me the address.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.102
They didn't take anything?

28:08.187 --> 28:10.187
I don't think
anything's missing.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.107
Why does that make me
feel worse?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.984
Well, you can't apply reasoning
to this, trust me.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.153
Someone might feel wronged
by you.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.614
They might want something
from you.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.950
Or, perhaps, it could have
nothing to do with you.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.285
Maybe they realized
I don't have anything.

28:25.371 --> 28:30.124
Not at all. You're just
charismatic, smart, funny.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.042
-Successful?
-[scoffs]

28:32.128 --> 28:35.254
or maybe
you're just the perfect target.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.714
Yeah.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.719
You're the only person
who can make me feel charmed

28:41.804 --> 28:43.220
by saying something like that.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.014
[both chuckling]

28:46.100 --> 28:48.726
-college? What's that? What...
-Oh, nothing.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.733
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.235
Wow, look at us.

28:58.279 --> 29:02.156
Who were these kids?
I was gonna be an fbi agent.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.324
You were gonna be
this big writer.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.534
Right.

29:11.459 --> 29:14.293
-What is that?
-[amelia sighs]

29:14.378 --> 29:15.419
it's nothing.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.255
Clearly not nothing
if you thought

29:18.340 --> 29:20.007
it might have been missing.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.092
It's just this book
I've been working on.

29:22.178 --> 29:24.428
You wrote a book?
What's it about?

29:24.513 --> 29:27.139
-It's boring.
-Stop. Tell me.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.850
It's this...

29:29.935 --> 29:33.937
Memoir slash lifestyle
something or other.

29:33.981 --> 29:38.442
I don't know. I can't get
out of my head about it.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.778
Probably never be finished.

29:42.782 --> 29:46.825
Well, to be honest,
I was surprised of you becoming

29:46.911 --> 29:48.368
the miss de-clutterer.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.747
[chuckles]
yup. That's me.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.958
I mean, it's great. Just not how
I thought things would end up.

29:55.002 --> 29:59.129
Yeah, me neither. It's why
I put so much into the blog.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.340
Became my only outlet
after the writing process

30:01.425 --> 30:02.841
stopped being my friend.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.093
-Why's that?
-I don't know.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.137
After my mom died, and
I was cleaning out her house,

30:07.223 --> 30:11.058
I became obsessed with neatness.

30:11.143 --> 30:15.270
I couldn't function unless
every detail was impeccable.

30:15.356 --> 30:18.941
Suddenly I couldn't write
the same way anymore.

30:19.026 --> 30:22.319
There's no clear answer
to what goes where.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.239
You can't color-code a memoir.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.825
And there's no immediate
gratification to a story

30:27.910 --> 30:29.993
that always feels so incomplete.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.373
I got stuck.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.792
-So I stopped.
-Hm.

30:36.877 --> 30:40.337
But I was sick about it,
you know, abandoning my dream.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.175
That's when I started the blog.

30:45.219 --> 30:49.429
I figured if I could write about
organizing other people's lives

30:49.515 --> 30:52.224
and stopped worrying so much
about my own,

30:52.309 --> 30:55.519
that maybe
that would fix things.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.313
And did it?

31:03.988 --> 31:05.904
You must be exhausted.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.323
Thank you so much for coming.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.245
Where will you go tonight?

31:13.330 --> 31:16.456
-You know you can't stay here.
-Uh, right.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.917
Get your things.
You can stay at my place.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.503
-I have a spare room.
-I'm fine.

31:21.589 --> 31:25.549
-I can just stay at the office.
-With the dead squirrel? Really?

31:34.476 --> 31:35.893
I wasn't sure what you'd want,

31:35.978 --> 31:38.395
so I brought a little bit
of everything.

31:40.441 --> 31:43.859
What? Is that white chocolate?

31:43.944 --> 31:47.446
You are the only person to this
day who likes white chocolate

31:47.531 --> 31:49.072
over original chocolate.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.408
And you just happen to have some
lying around?

31:51.452 --> 31:54.244
To be honest,
you hooked me back in college.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.079
[chuckles]

31:58.667 --> 32:01.835
you know,
I'm feeling better already.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.086
Good.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.050
Hm.

32:08.135 --> 32:11.011
-[laughter]
-oh, no way!

32:11.096 --> 32:13.430
Yeah. They got married.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.850
Well, they're divorced now,
but it was a wild night.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.436
[laughs]

32:19.521 --> 32:21.271
you'd gone by then.

32:25.694 --> 32:29.321
This has been so nice.
Thank you.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.282
I don't know when the last time
anyone did this for me.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.951
I'm glad you let me.

32:35.621 --> 32:39.081
-Oh, no, no, no, no, let me.
-No. Stop.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.375
Come on,
I feel guilty enough already.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.961
Please, you have no idea
how good it feels

32:44.046 --> 32:46.964
not to be fussed over
the last few days.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.301
You not helping helps me.
I swear.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.638
Well, just know
that it's extremely hard

32:54.723 --> 32:56.390
for me to watch you do all this.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.184
-It goes against my nature.
-And why's that?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.269
I'm used to doing everything
myself.

33:01.355 --> 33:05.065
You're used to it
or you insist on it?

33:05.150 --> 33:08.568
-Ah.
-You got to be careful.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.487
Making people
need you like that.

33:10.531 --> 33:13.240
I don't make people need me.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.410
You do have a way, though,
making people feel like

33:16.495 --> 33:18.203
they wouldn't know what to do
without you.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.706
I know I've felt that.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.332
[exhales sharply]

33:25.212 --> 33:26.628
can I ask?

33:28.048 --> 33:29.464
Why did you leave?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.674
Uh...

33:33.679 --> 33:37.222
I just felt really overwhelmed
after my mom got sick.

33:37.307 --> 33:40.225
And what we had was--

33:40.310 --> 33:42.227
I would have understood.

33:42.312 --> 33:46.106
I'm not saying
it was the right choice.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.692
But at the time, it felt like
the only option I had.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.694
You could have come back, after.

33:54.116 --> 33:55.615
Did I do something wrong?

33:55.701 --> 33:57.367
Of course not.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.370
[sighs]

34:06.712 --> 34:09.046
I was afraid
of losing myself again...

34:10.716 --> 34:13.258
The way that I always did
when I was with you.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.052
Ame, I really loved you.

34:16.305 --> 34:17.387
You know?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.225
But that was a long time ago.

34:22.311 --> 34:25.062
And things change for a reason,
I guess.

34:26.774 --> 34:30.567
Maybe we should just stick
to being friends?

34:33.781 --> 34:35.197
Yeah.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.305
Morning! Or afternoon.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.015
-Hi.
-Going somewhere?

35:02.101 --> 35:04.434
I'm actually late for a meeting.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.437
Oh. Um, all right.

35:07.523 --> 35:10.649
-No worries. I'll, uh...
-You know what?

35:10.734 --> 35:12.192
I can reschedule,
it's no big deal.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.027
-Really?
-Yeah.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.113
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

35:19.827 --> 35:22.702
-Hey. I'm here. Where are you?
-Hey, bec.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.746
Look, I'm so sorry,
but I'm not gonna make it.

35:24.832 --> 35:27.707
I'm actually at mark's.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.584
There was a break-in in my house
last night.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.712
-It's a whole thing.
-Oh, my god. Are you all right?

35:32.798 --> 35:35.132
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

35:35.217 --> 35:38.176
Can you please
just apologize to gwyneth

35:38.262 --> 35:39.636
and reschedule our appointment
for today?

35:39.680 --> 35:41.721
I'll call you later
to fill in the details.

35:41.807 --> 35:45.267
-Okay, sure, but--
-[amelia]<i> thank you. Bye.</i>

35:47.521 --> 35:51.565
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.152
This looks so good. Thank you.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.486
<i> Bon appetit.</i>

36:01.743 --> 36:05.579
-Good morning, gwyneth.
-Morning.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.497
-Where's amelia?
-I'm so sorry to tell you this.

36:07.583 --> 36:12.627
But... It's just me today.
I hope that's okay.

36:12.713 --> 36:15.714
I-I have lots of ideas on how
we can downsize that wine rack.

36:15.799 --> 36:18.175
Well, then, come on in.

36:28.145 --> 36:30.437
Liv took her own room
as things got worse.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.190
She didn't wanna be this sick,
needy thing all the time,

36:33.275 --> 36:36.651
so she said.
So she started to retreat.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.529
Said it was for my sake. How
could I get rid of any of it?

36:39.573 --> 36:43.241
After my dad died, my mom became
a hoarder of his things, too.

36:43.327 --> 36:46.578
And anytime I work with a client
who's suffered a loss,

36:46.663 --> 36:48.705
they can't imagine
remembering that person

36:48.749 --> 36:50.749
without something
to funnel it through.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.169
Our things feel like
an extension of us,

36:54.254 --> 36:57.505
of those we love.
But I'm telling you.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.884
And I know this is<i> cliche,</i>
but we keep them here.

37:07.768 --> 37:11.394
I'm sorry. It's just that I...

37:11.438 --> 37:13.313
I feel like
we could offend liv's memory

37:13.398 --> 37:16.900
if we got too close like that.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.904
And you shouldn't have to suffer
my grieving process.

37:20.948 --> 37:24.157
It's not fair,
you don't have to be here for me

37:24.243 --> 37:25.533
like you are
with your other clients.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.494
I want to be.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.581
Can I show you something?

37:39.633 --> 37:43.927
I wasn't entirely honest
about how I knew liv died.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.512
The funeral.

37:48.725 --> 37:51.226
She sent this to me before...

37:51.311 --> 37:54.020
[instrumental music]

38:11.748 --> 38:13.623
do you want some space?

38:15.877 --> 38:17.627
No, I don't want that.

38:18.547 --> 38:19.963
Not ever again.

38:22.426 --> 38:25.302
[music continues]

38:37.399 --> 38:38.481
mm...

38:45.073 --> 38:47.991
[intense music]

39:16.396 --> 39:17.687
[cell phone beeps]

39:46.510 --> 39:48.051
[birds chirping]

39:49.930 --> 39:51.763
tell me I'm not crazy.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.681
Is this a masterpiece?

39:53.767 --> 39:56.059
Uh, you're crazy.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.894
Oh.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.355
After last time, when I tried
to give the paintings away,

40:00.440 --> 40:03.149
I thought, maybe I can do this.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.071
[exhales sharply]

40:09.491 --> 40:11.408
thank you for your honesty.

40:11.493 --> 40:12.951
-Hm.
-Do you want a drink?

40:13.036 --> 40:16.996
-Sure. Okay.
-I could really use a drink.

40:17.082 --> 40:20.917
You know, this isn't about you
not trying new things.

40:20.961 --> 40:24.671
I'm only saying you shouldn't
try to be something you're not

40:24.756 --> 40:27.006
at the expense
of who you really are.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.592
And your space
should really reflect that.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.928
-Yeah.
-I'd hang that version up.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.638
-That version?
-Mm-hmm.

40:33.723 --> 40:36.015
It shows your struggle,

40:36.101 --> 40:39.978
your ambition
and your acceptance.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.480
Ah. That's pretty, uh,
that's pretty clever of you.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.023
-That's really good.
-Thank you.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.734
[chuckles] so tell me
about your writing.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.027
-My blog?
-Yeah.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.447
You're, you're pretty, uh,
you're prolific

40:50.532 --> 40:52.031
for a professional organizer.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.367
Oh. Well, I've always written.

40:54.453 --> 40:57.704
But the blog is all
I've really ever put out there.

40:57.789 --> 41:01.458
-Well, what haven't you put out?
-I have a manuscript.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.001
But it's very different
than the blog.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.086
Oh, see, now that's something
I would love to read.

41:05.172 --> 41:06.880
-[laughs]
-please?

41:06.965 --> 41:08.882
-Really? Oh, you'd do that?
-Yeah.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.800
You have a way with words.

41:10.886 --> 41:12.802
I'm sure it's something
very special.

41:12.888 --> 41:17.807
Well, consider me equal parts
grateful and terrified.

41:17.893 --> 41:20.477
-[chuckles]
-yeah. I feel the same way.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.609
Cheers to your writing

41:27.694 --> 41:31.571
and to the retirement
of that putrid painting.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.156
[laughs]

41:35.869 --> 41:37.619
that's great.
Mm.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.499
So who are you
outside of all this?

41:42.542 --> 41:46.377
You wear this, uh, veil
of professionalism around you.

41:46.463 --> 41:48.630
Or is that in this, uh,
this book you're writing?

41:48.715 --> 41:52.133
-Mm.
-Wait. No spoilers.

41:52.219 --> 41:55.762
Uh, that's just me, I guess.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.181
No real personal life
to speak of.

41:58.225 --> 42:01.809
Have you ever thought about
dating one of your clients?

42:01.853 --> 42:03.853
Or would that be too chaotic?

42:05.649 --> 42:08.525
Was that too strong?
Uh, that's not what I intended.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.193
Uh, I'm sorry
it came out that way.

42:10.237 --> 42:13.571
No. Um, I mean, it was.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.657
But, uh,

42:15.742 --> 42:18.868
I'm sort of seeing someone.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.871
Oh, of course. Above board.
I get it.

42:23.542 --> 42:24.958
He's a lucky guy.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.876
[cell phone beeps]

42:26.962 --> 42:29.796
oh, speaking of...

42:29.881 --> 42:32.048
-Would you mind?
-Please.

42:38.181 --> 42:41.182
-Hey, mark, what's up?
-Hey, where are you?

42:41.268 --> 42:43.142
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.061
I stepped out
for a client meeting.

42:45.146 --> 42:49.190
-You were sleeping.
-Oh, jeez. Thank god.

42:49.276 --> 42:52.569
I woke up terrified.
Are you sure you're okay?

42:52.612 --> 42:56.531
-Uh, can I come get you?
-No, I'm good, thank you.

42:56.575 --> 42:59.200
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I just, um...

42:59.244 --> 43:00.660
I can't breathe at the moment.

43:00.745 --> 43:01.953
I-I think I'm having
a panic attack.

43:02.038 --> 43:05.582
Okay, just take a breath,
sit down,

43:05.667 --> 43:07.667
have some water,
I'll be back soon.

43:07.752 --> 43:08.918
Okay.

43:11.631 --> 43:12.964
[forrest] is everything okay?

43:13.049 --> 43:17.594
Yeah, yeah, everything's good.
Thanks. Uh...

43:17.637 --> 43:19.887
We can do this another day
if you have to leave.

43:19.931 --> 43:23.099
-I do. Thank you.
-Yeah, no problem.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.229
[door opens]

43:32.694 --> 43:33.943
hey.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.655
Are you feeling better?

43:37.741 --> 43:40.241
I just, I thought
I lost you again.

43:40.285 --> 43:42.201
Of course not.

43:42.287 --> 43:45.622
I'm sorry, I guess I should've
told you that I had a meeting.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.875
There's something
I need to show you.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.043
Okay.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.882
Okay. Look here.

43:55.967 --> 43:59.677
I was able to track the ip
address for the chaos user.

43:59.763 --> 44:02.722
It pinged a couple of locations,
an office building,

44:02.807 --> 44:05.224
your office building,
an apartment complex

44:05.310 --> 44:07.894
and a yoga studio.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.103
Becca.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.939
No.

44:12.025 --> 44:14.108
-It can't be.
-Your assistant?

44:14.194 --> 44:16.778
You said
you guys are on the outs lately.

44:16.863 --> 44:17.987
That she's testing you?

44:18.073 --> 44:20.031
I mean,
I guess I should have seen it.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.908
But, what,
she's trying to scare me

44:21.993 --> 44:23.785
so that I bow out
of my own company?

44:23.828 --> 44:26.621
I've seen it before, my clients,
they gain a bit of notoriety

44:26.665 --> 44:28.665
and everybody wants
a piece of them.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.210
It's not a safe life
for somebody who feels

44:32.295 --> 44:34.128
indebted to everyone.

44:34.214 --> 44:36.798
And I love that about you,
but you gotta be more careful.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.925
She must have been
a part of the break-in, too.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.594
She was in your house.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.596
Probably looking for something
to use against you.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.723
I need to talk to her
about this.

44:45.809 --> 44:47.892
Okay, let's wait. You don't
want things to get ugly.

44:47.977 --> 44:51.979
Strategize how to manage this,
because she could be unstable.

44:52.065 --> 44:56.150
Yeah. Fine. Maybe you're right.

44:56.236 --> 44:59.862
But, hey, whatever you need,
I'm here, okay?

45:09.249 --> 45:11.708
-[amelia exhales]
-morning.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.295
Okay, wait.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.005
Before you get upset...

45:18.049 --> 45:21.175
It went really well
with gwyneth.

45:21.261 --> 45:25.221
I mean, she's a bit clingy with
me now, but the heat's off you.

45:25.265 --> 45:27.140
And I think it looked better
for squirrel that we didn't

45:27.225 --> 45:29.183
cancel last minute,
you know what I mean?

45:29.269 --> 45:31.686
Wait.
What are you even talking about?

45:31.771 --> 45:34.063
The session yesterday.
I took it.

45:34.107 --> 45:36.941
[scoffs] of course you did.

45:37.026 --> 45:40.862
Meels, it was only one session.

45:40.947 --> 45:43.823
[sighs] and I can assure you,
she's still<i> your</i> biggest fan.

45:43.908 --> 45:47.368
Stop talking, becca.
I'm not even talking about that.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.829
This is about you edging me out.

45:49.914 --> 45:53.166
-What?
-I know you're chaos, becca.

45:53.251 --> 45:55.918
-Give it up.
-What?

45:55.962 --> 45:58.921
You think I'm chaos?

45:59.007 --> 46:00.757
Where the hell
is this coming from?

46:00.800 --> 46:02.842
Your ip address, apparently.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.844
And I have the proof
right here on my laptop.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.262
Show me.

46:11.311 --> 46:12.977
-I can't belie--
-you don't have access...

46:13.062 --> 46:15.730
To anything in this office
anymore.

46:15.815 --> 46:17.273
Pack your things.

46:17.317 --> 46:20.193
Please think about this
for a second.

46:20.278 --> 46:23.696
Uh, I know we have our problems,
but this is next level.

46:23.782 --> 46:27.950
-I'm actually worried for you.
-[scoffs]

46:28.036 --> 46:30.286
where did you get
this so-called proof?

46:30.330 --> 46:33.498
Mark. Not only
is he really good at security.

46:33.583 --> 46:37.126
But he tracked the ip address
back to you.

46:37.170 --> 46:40.254
So you had mark
dig around on me?

46:40.298 --> 46:44.050
-Mm-hmm.
-Amelia, he's lying.

46:44.135 --> 46:47.094
-[chuckles]
-I'm not chaos!

46:47.180 --> 46:49.847
I can't believe
I actually have to say that.

46:49.933 --> 46:51.808
Please don't make this harder
than it already is.

46:51.893 --> 46:54.143
If you leave now,
I won't press charges,

46:54.187 --> 46:55.937
and I'll send you
your final check.

46:56.022 --> 46:58.481
Three years,
and this is what I get?

47:00.026 --> 47:01.150
[scoffs]

47:05.073 --> 47:07.782
best be careful
without me, meels.

47:07.867 --> 47:09.992
No one left to catch your fall.

47:16.918 --> 47:19.836
[instrumental music]

47:37.981 --> 47:40.022
I missed this.

47:41.234 --> 47:43.192
You feel the same, you know?

47:43.278 --> 47:45.319
Like comfort food.

47:46.406 --> 47:47.989
Good.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.866
And this is where we'll stay.

47:49.951 --> 47:53.202
Mm... If only.

47:55.248 --> 47:57.331
[chuckles]
where are you going?

47:57.417 --> 47:59.375
I've got to get some work done.

47:59.419 --> 48:02.545
I haven't touched the blog
since I left the office.

48:02.630 --> 48:05.548
Okay, fine.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.383
But kiss me first.

48:16.561 --> 48:19.562
[intense music]

48:38.374 --> 48:40.082
morning.

48:40.168 --> 48:44.045
By the looks of it, weekends
aren't a thing in your life.

48:44.130 --> 48:47.298
-Is it Saturday?
-It's Sunday.

48:47.383 --> 48:48.841
Where did yesterday go?

48:48.927 --> 48:52.970
You didn't leave the study once.

48:53.056 --> 48:56.349
If I didn't bring you food,
you would have starved.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.559
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.061
I'm just trying
to get my bearings

49:00.104 --> 49:02.063
now that becca's gone.

49:02.148 --> 49:04.899
I had a slew of angry
reader comments to respond to

49:04.984 --> 49:08.110
after I missed
my Monday motivation blog post.

49:08.196 --> 49:11.072
Wow. I wish I had you
like your followers do.

49:11.157 --> 49:13.074
I don't see them
making you three meals a day.

49:13.117 --> 49:16.077
You're right. You spoil me good.

49:19.082 --> 49:21.499
Oh. Are you pouting right now?

49:21.584 --> 49:24.251
Don't tease,
unless I get some time.

49:25.213 --> 49:26.629
Hm. Okay.

49:34.514 --> 49:37.473
[laptop keys clacking]

49:40.436 --> 49:43.312
[dramatic music]

50:13.344 --> 50:14.468
[cell phone beeps]

50:31.529 --> 50:34.363
[music continues]

51:02.852 --> 51:05.728
[music continues]

51:16.199 --> 51:18.282
morning.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.618
-Morning.
-What was that, on your screen?

51:20.703 --> 51:25.039
Oh, it's just...
Uh, raccoon burglary.

51:25.124 --> 51:27.208
Trash cans
were knocked over today.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.126
I didn't know
you had cameras here.

51:29.212 --> 51:31.629
Of course I do. It's what I do.

51:31.714 --> 51:34.090
Well, I hope
I didn't ruin the surprise.

51:35.176 --> 51:36.550
What surprise?

51:36.594 --> 51:39.220
I wasn't only working
all weekend.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.263
I also made you this.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.310
[instrumental music]

51:46.395 --> 51:48.229
it's all the notes
she wrote you.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.564
I hope you don't mind
I saw some of them.

51:53.903 --> 51:58.739
I'm sorry, I just, I didn't want
her to get lost in all of this,

51:58.825 --> 52:01.075
especially since it's her letter
that brought us back together

52:01.119 --> 52:03.327
after all these years...

52:03.412 --> 52:06.622
Amelia, this is incredible.

52:06.707 --> 52:09.792
-I don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

52:09.877 --> 52:11.836
You've done enough for me
already.

52:11.921 --> 52:15.798
You protected me
against my better judgment,

52:15.842 --> 52:18.342
just like you did back then.

52:18.427 --> 52:21.595
And I promise, moving forward,
that I will balance

52:21.681 --> 52:24.473
my work life better
so I can be here with you more.

52:24.517 --> 52:26.267
-Really?
-Yeah.

52:26.352 --> 52:27.810
I like the sound of that.

52:33.526 --> 52:34.483
Wow.

52:41.367 --> 52:43.284
So do you need anything
from the store

52:43.369 --> 52:44.827
for this evening while I'm out?

52:44.912 --> 52:46.495
You're leaving today?

52:46.539 --> 52:48.330
I thought you had to finish
your Monday piece.

52:48.374 --> 52:50.249
Finished it last night already.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.376
I have a client meeting today.

52:52.461 --> 52:55.713
I didn't tell you,
but this publisher, my client,

52:55.798 --> 52:57.715
he wants to read my book.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.799
Hm.

53:00.219 --> 53:03.179
Isn't that exciting?

53:03.222 --> 53:05.264
You just said you were gonna
stay here with me.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.183
I meant, last week
I was super neglectful,

53:07.226 --> 53:10.519
but I promise
not to do that again.

53:10.605 --> 53:13.230
This is a standing appointment
with my client.

53:13.316 --> 53:15.149
I'm still gonna have
a lot of those.

53:15.193 --> 53:18.360
I'll come back right after,
promise.

53:20.281 --> 53:21.822
It's exciting though, right?

53:21.866 --> 53:23.866
I could be the next marie kondo.

53:27.413 --> 53:29.413
Amelia, I don't understand.

53:29.498 --> 53:30.706
After everything
that's happened,

53:30.791 --> 53:32.917
you still wanna connect
with even more people

53:33.002 --> 53:34.501
who'd try
to take advantage of you?

53:34.587 --> 53:37.880
Take advantage of me?
With my book?

53:37.924 --> 53:41.800
Yes. This forrest guy,
you don't even know him.

53:41.886 --> 53:43.510
How do you know
you can trust him?

53:43.554 --> 53:45.888
How did you know
his name is forrest?

53:45.973 --> 53:48.682
You said it the last time
you went to meet with him.

53:48.768 --> 53:51.769
Okay, but I don't see
what the big deal is.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.270
He seems perfectly nice.

53:53.356 --> 53:55.648
And I'm sure
he's gonna love the book.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.942
And I have all the faith
that what you've written

53:58.027 --> 54:00.569
is gonna make an impact,
but I need you to be prepared

54:00.613 --> 54:02.696
for all the possibilities.

54:02.782 --> 54:05.699
Why would you even think
to worry?

54:05.785 --> 54:07.243
How did you meet this guy?

54:07.286 --> 54:10.746
Uh, becca found him.

54:10.790 --> 54:12.915
She found him on the site.

54:12.959 --> 54:15.251
-He's a follower.
-See?

54:15.336 --> 54:17.419
They could be working together,
amelia.

54:17.505 --> 54:19.880
We still don't know
who broke in to your place.

54:19.966 --> 54:23.634
Do you really think becca's dumb
enough to do this on her own?

54:23.719 --> 54:25.386
This guy
could be working with her.

54:25.471 --> 54:28.222
And now they wanna
steal your book, publish it

54:28.266 --> 54:30.266
and take you
for every penny you're worth.

54:30.309 --> 54:32.893
[sighs]

54:32.937 --> 54:35.729
mark, this is a bit out of line.

54:35.815 --> 54:37.648
Plus, I trust this guy.

54:37.733 --> 54:41.443
He, he feels like a friend.

54:43.281 --> 54:45.739
-Is that all?
-[amelia scoffs]

54:52.665 --> 54:54.873
of course that's all. Seriously?

54:54.959 --> 54:56.875
If I'm gonna let myself
fall for you again,

54:56.961 --> 54:59.253
I need to know you're not gonna
be as reckless as you were

54:59.338 --> 55:02.464
with my heart as in college.

55:02.550 --> 55:04.675
You have to take your safety
seriously.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.469
I do.
Especially now, thanks to you.

55:07.555 --> 55:09.638
Really? Because I'm not so sure.

55:11.767 --> 55:13.892
Mark, I can't stop
running my business

55:13.978 --> 55:17.438
on the off chance that someone
might take advantage of me.

55:17.481 --> 55:21.400
I can't be suspicious of every
single person on the planet.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.694
So I'm acting crazy then,
I guess.

55:23.779 --> 55:24.820
[amelia sighs]

55:27.408 --> 55:29.408
mark, I understand
that you've seen

55:29.493 --> 55:32.328
a lot of suspicious things
at your job.

55:32.371 --> 55:33.746
But I work with good people

55:33.831 --> 55:36.623
and their messy cabinets
and drawers.

55:36.709 --> 55:39.460
I'm not
in a dangerous line of work.

55:39.545 --> 55:44.506
I can't judge everyone
based on becca or chaos.

55:44.592 --> 55:49.511
But, hey, if it's too much
for you to have me here,

55:49.597 --> 55:52.973
I can go back to my place.
I'll understand.

55:53.017 --> 55:56.852
Don't say that.
Of course I want you here.

55:56.937 --> 55:59.855
The last thing I want
is for you to go.

55:59.899 --> 56:02.316
I just need to know that
this guy can be trusted is all.

56:02.401 --> 56:05.027
Okay. So how do we do that?

56:16.665 --> 56:19.500
How about this visit,
you plant a camera in his house?

56:19.585 --> 56:21.001
We make sure he's not
up to something, and then

56:21.087 --> 56:22.920
you can go back
and re-collect it the next time.

56:23.005 --> 56:26.465
-No harm, no foul.
-This feels extremely illegal.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.092
And so is stealing
someone's book idea.

56:28.177 --> 56:31.678
But it, it happens all the time.
And you have to admit...

56:31.764 --> 56:34.890
The potential becca connection
is here.

56:34.934 --> 56:38.727
It's just your life's work
on the line, okay?

56:51.534 --> 56:53.367
-Hi.
-Hey.

56:53.452 --> 56:56.036
Oh, here it is.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.414
The manuscript, how exciting.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.083
"by amelia sommers."

57:05.589 --> 57:07.089
you okay?

57:07.174 --> 57:09.591
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

57:12.596 --> 57:15.931
Actually,
can I use your restroom?

57:15.975 --> 57:17.724
Yeah, no problem.

57:17.810 --> 57:19.852
I just have to grab a few books,
and I can meet you inside.

57:19.937 --> 57:21.103
Okay.

57:28.696 --> 57:31.613
[dramatic music]

57:39.874 --> 57:41.123
[mark] nice.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.802
Okay, I got the last...

57:53.888 --> 57:55.596
[indistinct chatter]

58:00.019 --> 58:04.104
so what are we thinking?
By title? By author?

58:04.190 --> 58:06.023
Is it weird if I wanna
put them up at random?

58:06.108 --> 58:07.608
Just all over the place?

58:07.693 --> 58:09.568
Just the thought
is giving me anxiety.

58:09.653 --> 58:12.029
Well, I like the idea
that my eyes catch the book.

58:12.114 --> 58:15.115
Now if I have to find one, it
just, you know, calls out to me.

58:15.201 --> 58:16.742
-Forrest...
-[both chuckling]

58:16.827 --> 58:19.453
you won't be able
to find anything that way.

58:19.538 --> 58:20.787
The point
is to make it functional.

58:20.873 --> 58:22.956
Well, if I ever have
to find just one,

58:23.042 --> 58:25.459
then maybe I'd be forced
to consider them all.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.711
And who knows, maybe I'd find
something more interesting.

58:27.796 --> 58:29.463
-Oh, you have books.
-A few.

58:29.548 --> 58:30.714
How do you,
how do you sort 'em?

58:30.799 --> 58:33.717
-By color.
-[both laughing]

58:33.802 --> 58:36.470
it's more of a look than a feel.

58:36.514 --> 58:38.847
I mean, it feels good,
it feels...

58:38.891 --> 58:41.099
-Tidy. Huh.
-Hm.

58:41.185 --> 58:44.019
[both chuckling]

58:44.063 --> 58:48.023
I, uh, I want to say
it means a lot, you know,

58:48.108 --> 58:51.109
that you're trusting me
with your manuscript.

58:51.195 --> 58:53.237
I know how terrifying it must
be, but I feel really honored

58:53.322 --> 58:56.990
that you're allowing me
to, to read it.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.451
-Thank you.
-[cell phone ringing]

58:59.537 --> 59:02.037
will you, uh, excuse me for
a second? I have to get that.

59:04.124 --> 59:07.042
[cell phone ringing]

59:09.547 --> 59:12.548
[intense music]

59:18.180 --> 59:19.555
[mark] don't.

59:21.058 --> 59:23.934
[forrest] amelia?

59:24.019 --> 59:28.689
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry.
What, uh, what, what is that?

59:28.774 --> 59:29.898
[sighs]

59:31.110 --> 59:33.902
I'm so sorry. I, uh...

59:35.281 --> 59:39.575
See, I'm in this
stalker situation,

59:39.660 --> 59:41.535
and I had an intruder
in my place.

59:41.620 --> 59:45.747
And you'll have to forgive me,
but, um...

59:46.959 --> 59:48.875
I put this up.

59:48.961 --> 59:52.254
And then I realized immediately
that it was very wrong.

59:53.632 --> 59:55.674
[chuckles]

59:55.759 --> 59:58.927
you, you were trying
to record me?

59:58.971 --> 1:00:00.929
Yeah, but only as a precaution.

1:00:01.015 --> 1:00:05.267
I promised myself no bathrooms,
no bedrooms, just as a way to--

1:00:05.311 --> 1:00:07.561
to see me coming and going?

1:00:07.605 --> 1:00:11.273
Oh, you, uh, you do this
to all your clients?

1:00:11.358 --> 1:00:14.985
No. No, no, this isn't me.
Not at all.

1:00:15.070 --> 1:00:16.778
I would never do this to anyone.

1:00:16.864 --> 1:00:18.238
But you, you did it.

1:00:20.159 --> 1:00:23.785
To me. Okay, why didn't you
just tell me?

1:00:23.829 --> 1:00:27.581
Did I pressure you, you-you...
You-you didn't have to...

1:00:27.666 --> 1:00:29.708
You didn't have
to keep working here. Maybe...

1:00:29.793 --> 1:00:32.836
I know. I know.
I'm so sorry, I...

1:00:32.921 --> 1:00:35.172
Look, this is just
a huge misunderstanding.

1:00:35.257 --> 1:00:40.135
Can we please just forget it
and get back to work?

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:45.140
I-I think I'd, I think
I'd like you to actually leave.

1:00:51.023 --> 1:00:52.648
I'm so sorry.

1:01:04.745 --> 1:01:07.663
[instrumental music]

1:01:21.345 --> 1:01:24.304
[intense music]

1:01:24.390 --> 1:01:26.682
I think I should go home
for a bit.

1:01:26.767 --> 1:01:29.685
So you're running away again.

1:01:29.728 --> 1:01:32.145
I'm sure you saw what happened.

1:01:32.231 --> 1:01:35.982
It's too much. I'm a mess.

1:01:36.068 --> 1:01:37.818
You don't need
to deal with me anymore.

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:39.861
What if I wanna deal with you?

1:01:41.073 --> 1:01:43.740
Amelia, this isn't one-sided.

1:01:43.826 --> 1:01:46.785
I'm not a client or a follower.

1:01:46.870 --> 1:01:48.161
Uh, I don't want a relationship

1:01:48.247 --> 1:01:51.206
that's wrapped
in a tiny little bow.

1:01:51.291 --> 1:01:54.334
That's what ruined us before.

1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:57.838
But we have to be together
on this. Same page.

1:01:58.424 --> 1:01:59.881
Come here.

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:03.218
It's gonna be okay.

1:02:05.180 --> 1:02:08.724
So from now on,
all comments will route to me,

1:02:08.809 --> 1:02:10.726
and I'll make sure
to weed out all the creeps.

-what?

1:02:13.981 --> 1:02:15.647
It's what becca always wanted.

1:02:15.733 --> 1:02:18.900
She wanted to control you.
I wanna help you.

1:02:35.294 --> 1:02:37.252

1:03:03.155 --> 1:03:06.239
are you sure
you're comfortable with this?

1:03:06.283 --> 1:03:08.200
People aren't their things,
right?

1:03:08.285 --> 1:03:11.870
It's time to start over,
just like liv wanted.

1:03:11.955 --> 1:03:14.456
-You good? Okay.
-Yeah. Thank you.

1:03:14.541 --> 1:03:16.833
All right. Now food.

1:03:16.919 --> 1:03:18.251
-Okay.
-All right.

[mark] hey, come sit!
Food's ready!

1:04:49.928 --> 1:04:52.345
Actually,
I'm not feeling so great.

1:04:52.431 --> 1:04:54.514
Like, maybe I should just
lay down for a bit.

1:04:54.558 --> 1:04:58.476
-You okay? What's wrong?
-Yeah, I...

1:04:58.562 --> 1:05:01.521
Um, it's just been
an overwhelming few days.

1:05:01.607 --> 1:05:03.565
Well, you know
what can help with that?

1:05:03.609 --> 1:05:05.859
Pancakes.

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:09.321
-Come eat.
-I'm good. Really.

1:05:09.406 --> 1:05:11.573
Thank you. Maybe later?

1:05:14.369 --> 1:05:17.537
-Something wrong?
-No. No.

1:05:17.581 --> 1:05:21.082
I just, I hit a wall,
that's all.

1:05:21.126 --> 1:05:23.877
Hm. Well, why don't you
go lay down?

1:05:23.962 --> 1:05:28.048
Uh, if I'm sick,
I don't wanna give it to you.

1:05:28.133 --> 1:05:32.260
May I just lay down in here...
If that's okay?

1:05:32.346 --> 1:05:35.430
Wow. You sound exactly like liv.

1:05:35.515 --> 1:05:40.602
Uh... Uh, speaking of,
I found this jewelry box.

1:05:40.646 --> 1:05:43.355
It is hers, and I thought,

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.941
I remember her sister
saying at the memorial

1:05:45.984 --> 1:05:48.151
that she wanted
some of liv's things.

1:05:48.236 --> 1:05:50.904
Maybe I could bring this to her
on my way to work tomorrow?

1:05:50.989 --> 1:05:53.114
That's sweet, but I can
run it over to vicki's

1:05:53.158 --> 1:05:55.283
next week myself.

1:05:55.327 --> 1:05:57.077
You're so thoughtful, meels.

1:05:58.705 --> 1:06:01.206
That's what
becca used to call me.

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:04.960
Oh. Well,
now it can be our thing.

1:06:06.505 --> 1:06:08.129
Oh, and...

1:06:12.386 --> 1:06:15.095
Maybe vicki'll want this, too.

1:06:15.180 --> 1:06:20.100

-Much better, thanks.

1:07:55.739 --> 1:08:00.116
I was thinking, since
you've been so overwhelmed,

1:08:00.202 --> 1:08:02.911
we get out of town
for a few days.

1:08:02.954 --> 1:08:04.913
I know the perfect place.

1:08:04.998 --> 1:08:06.206

Hi, becca.

1:10:24.346 --> 1:10:26.679
I really messed up.

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:28.723
I don't even know
how to begin to apologize,

1:10:28.808 --> 1:10:32.685
but I'm in some sort of trouble
with mark.

1:10:32.771 --> 1:10:34.729
I didn't know who else to call.

1:10:34.773 --> 1:10:36.689
I'm on my way over to
liv's sister's house right now.

1:10:36.775 --> 1:10:39.067
Can you please
just call me back asap?

1:10:49.663 --> 1:10:52.247
-Hi. Can I help you?
-Vicki. Hi.

1:10:52.332 --> 1:10:54.999
-Do you remember me?
-Should I?

1:10:55.085 --> 1:10:57.210
We met at your sister's funeral.

1:10:57.295 --> 1:10:59.254
I really need to talk to you
about mark and liv.

1:10:59.297 --> 1:11:01.047
[sighs]
come on in.

1:11:03.426 --> 1:11:07.679
Forgive the mess of boxes.
I'm moving early next week.

1:11:07.764 --> 1:11:10.139
-Moving?
-I only came to be close to liv.

1:11:10.225 --> 1:11:11.933
I work from home.

1:11:11.977 --> 1:11:14.018
Thought it'd be nice
to escape the city for a while.

1:11:14.104 --> 1:11:15.812
Had no idea
what kinda hell it'd be.

1:11:15.897 --> 1:11:17.605
-When did you all move here?
-Mm...

1:11:17.691 --> 1:11:20.858
Maybe two years ago they did?
I only came a few months after.

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:23.820
And why did they move,
if you don't mind me asking?

1:11:23.905 --> 1:11:26.072
Liv said change of scenery.

1:11:26.157 --> 1:11:28.116
But, to me,
it was just another tactic

1:11:28.159 --> 1:11:29.409
mark used
to take liv further away.

1:11:29.494 --> 1:11:30.868
Now, what do you have to do
with mark?

1:11:30.954 --> 1:11:32.870
I want nothing to do with him.

1:11:32.956 --> 1:11:34.998
I found liv's divorce paperwork

1:11:35.083 --> 1:11:38.584
and a letter from you
about getting away.

1:11:38.628 --> 1:11:40.295
But everything mark has said
about their marriage,

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:43.881
everything I've seen makes it
seem like they were so in love.

1:11:43.967 --> 1:11:46.259
-Why?
-They were in love.

1:11:46.344 --> 1:11:49.095
Even I have to admit that.

1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:52.890
Mark came into liv's life like
some knight in shining armor.

1:11:52.976 --> 1:11:54.767
Before mark,
liv was being watched.

1:11:54.811 --> 1:11:57.437
Someone even
broke into her house.

1:11:57.522 --> 1:11:59.147
Liv thought
someone was out to get her

1:11:59.190 --> 1:12:01.899
and mark came into the picture
and made her feel safe.

1:12:01.985 --> 1:12:05.320
And magically,
all the creepy stuff stopped.

1:12:05.405 --> 1:12:08.156
They got married fast,
things seemed great.

1:12:08.199 --> 1:12:12.201
She was this free-spirited,
self-made woman, you know?

1:12:12.287 --> 1:12:13.870
And then all of a sudden
she started letting mark

1:12:13.955 --> 1:12:15.997
keep all these tabs on her.

1:12:16.082 --> 1:12:17.915
Wouldn't go anywhere
without her.

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:19.667
We stopped knowing liv as liv.

1:12:19.753 --> 1:12:23.171
She became liv as mark and then
just kinda someone else.

1:12:23.256 --> 1:12:26.132
She wouldn't answer my calls,
she stopped coming around.

1:12:26.217 --> 1:12:27.967
Then she quit her job
at the school,

1:12:28.053 --> 1:12:29.761
and the only way
she'd talk to me was over text.

1:12:29.846 --> 1:12:31.346
So finally I showed up
and confronted her,

1:12:31.389 --> 1:12:33.931
and mark stepped in and told me
that I was being jealous

1:12:34.017 --> 1:12:35.975
and didn't have
her best interests at heart,

1:12:36.019 --> 1:12:37.393
which is insane.

1:12:37.479 --> 1:12:40.229
I was so happy
she'd found someone.

1:12:40.315 --> 1:12:41.898
I knew in my heart
after some time had passed

1:12:41.983 --> 1:12:44.233
that he wasn't the right one.

1:12:44.319 --> 1:12:47.862
But that didn't stop me
from trying.

1:12:47.906 --> 1:12:51.282
And then all of a sudden
she started to get sick.

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.326
Real sick.

1:12:54.371 --> 1:12:56.996
And things changed again.

1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:58.373
She got a letter to me

1:12:58.458 --> 1:13:00.792
apologizing for
what had happened between us.

1:13:00.877 --> 1:13:02.377
I had a courier
sneak one out to her

1:13:02.462 --> 1:13:03.920
when mark was out
getting groceries,

1:13:04.005 --> 1:13:06.047
days before she was just...

1:13:07.926 --> 1:13:09.050
Gone.

1:13:10.929 --> 1:13:13.012
I think she knew
the end was near.

1:13:13.098 --> 1:13:15.264
Didn't want it to be with mark.

1:13:15.350 --> 1:13:19.894
But by then I was,
it was too late.

1:13:19.938 --> 1:13:22.939
What did she die of,
if you don't mind?

1:13:23.024 --> 1:13:26.359
Um, a stroke, from diabetes.

1:13:26.444 --> 1:13:30.154
She'd had it since she was a kid
and she managed it well.

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:32.365
It wasn't until she got with
mark that things took a dive.

1:13:32.450 --> 1:13:35.743
In her letter, she said
she had a terminal illness.

1:13:35.787 --> 1:13:37.370
That's ridiculous. What letter?

1:13:37.414 --> 1:13:38.871
Um...

1:13:45.046 --> 1:13:47.380
She sent that to me
before she died,

1:13:47.465 --> 1:13:50.174
basically telling me
to get back together with mark.

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:52.427
That's why this is so confusing.

1:13:54.139 --> 1:13:55.346
[amelia] what?

1:14:02.397 --> 1:14:05.022
This is the letter
liv gave to me before she died.

1:14:05.108 --> 1:14:06.566
Look at the handwriting.

1:14:08.486 --> 1:14:10.445
[amelia] ah. Ah...

1:14:10.530 --> 1:14:12.488
[chuckles]

1:14:12.574 --> 1:14:15.741
I don't understand.

1:14:15.827 --> 1:14:18.202
I've seen all of these notes
that liv wrote to mark,

1:14:18.288 --> 1:14:20.246
and they all look like
this one here.

1:14:20.331 --> 1:14:22.206
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1:14:22.292 --> 1:14:25.209
I spent hours looking at them.

1:14:25.295 --> 1:14:26.836
I made him a collage.

1:14:26.921 --> 1:14:28.296
And what about mark?

1:14:28.339 --> 1:14:31.841
Do you recall
what his handwriting looks like?

1:14:31.926 --> 1:14:35.470
When liv wanted out,
he took her. I know he did.

1:14:35.555 --> 1:14:38.473
And I will spend the rest
of my life trying to prove it.

1:14:41.978 --> 1:14:43.978
You should be careful with him.

1:14:44.063 --> 1:14:46.272
If not, he might do
the same thing to you.

1:14:55.617 --> 1:14:56.991
[cell phone beeps]

1:15:00.872 --> 1:15:03.789
-[sighs]
-[cell phone vibrating]

1:15:03.833 --> 1:15:06.292
becca. Hi. Thank god.

1:15:06.377 --> 1:15:08.085
Can you meet me at squirrel
in an hour?

1:15:10.548 --> 1:15:12.507
[knocking on door]

1:15:32.278 --> 1:15:33.486
hello?

1:15:33.530 --> 1:15:35.947
[dramatic music]

1:15:49.629 --> 1:15:52.171
[music continues]

1:15:54.133 --> 1:15:55.675
nice conversation
with my future wife?

1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:58.052
[vicki screams]

1:16:04.143 --> 1:16:06.644
come on, bec, where are you?

1:16:08.356 --> 1:16:10.064
-[cell phone beeps]
-[gasps]

1:16:19.409 --> 1:16:21.075
-hey!
-[gasps]

1:16:21.119 --> 1:16:23.578
what are you doing here
all alone, outside the office

1:16:23.621 --> 1:16:25.329
someone used to be
stalking you from?

1:16:25.415 --> 1:16:26.914
I, um...

1:16:28.418 --> 1:16:30.626
Uh, I'm-I'm meeting becca here.

1:16:30.712 --> 1:16:32.169
She'll be here any minute,
we're gonna talk--

1:16:32.255 --> 1:16:34.630
you and I both know
that that cannot happen.

1:16:34.716 --> 1:16:36.424
She cannot be trusted.

1:17:04.746 --> 1:17:06.871
You know what?

1:17:06.956 --> 1:17:09.498
I think now's the perfect time
for us to go on our retreat.

1:17:09.584 --> 1:17:11.208
Our retreat?

1:17:11.294 --> 1:17:15.004
Get out of town,
like we decided.

1:17:15.089 --> 1:17:16.589
Somewhere no one can find us.

1:17:16.674 --> 1:17:18.507
But we didn't bring our things.

1:17:18.593 --> 1:17:20.551
It's like you said.

1:17:20.637 --> 1:17:22.637
-All you need is this.
-[gasps]

1:17:25.725 --> 1:17:28.309
okay, just let me text becca
and tell her--

1:17:28.394 --> 1:17:31.145
no. Absolutely not.

1:17:31.230 --> 1:17:34.315
She does not deserve your time
or your attention.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.067
We both know that.

1:17:40.448 --> 1:17:42.323
You're gonna love this place.

1:17:47.163 --> 1:17:48.829
[engine starts]

1:17:55.213 --> 1:17:57.088
mm...

1:17:57.173 --> 1:18:00.341
I was gonna wake you,
but you looked so peaceful.

1:18:04.764 --> 1:18:07.181
I'm starving, though.
You hungry?

1:18:09.268 --> 1:18:13.020
Oh. I left you some clean
clothes at the foot of the bed.

1:18:19.362 --> 1:18:20.361
-[becca] forrest?
-Hi.

1:18:20.446 --> 1:18:22.446
[becca] what are you doing here?

1:18:22.532 --> 1:18:24.740
Amelia left this at my place.
I wanted to return it.

1:18:24.826 --> 1:18:26.617
You haven't heard from her,
have you?

1:18:26.703 --> 1:18:28.452
She was supposed
to meet me here last night,

1:18:28.538 --> 1:18:31.414
and she didn't show up, and now
she's not answering my calls

1:18:31.499 --> 1:18:32.707
and I'm totally freaking out.

1:18:32.750 --> 1:18:36.627
Uh, I-I haven't seen her.

1:18:36.713 --> 1:18:39.046
Not since she tried to plant
a camera in my house, anyway.

1:18:39.090 --> 1:18:41.257
-[sighs]
-wait, hold up!

1:18:41.342 --> 1:18:44.051
Wait, what's-what's-what's
wrong? What happened?

1:18:44.095 --> 1:18:45.970
She's in trouble,
I just know it.

1:18:46.055 --> 1:18:49.265
-What kind of trouble?
-It's this guy she's dating.

1:18:49.350 --> 1:18:52.059
He's put all kinds of things
in her head.

1:18:52.145 --> 1:18:53.519
She called me
panicking last night

1:18:53.604 --> 1:18:56.230
because she found
some pretty dark stuff.

1:18:56.315 --> 1:18:58.149
And now she's gone
and I don't know what to do.

1:18:58.234 --> 1:19:00.359
I mean, do you think
we should just call the police?

1:19:00.445 --> 1:19:03.112
Well, uh, if you can't
figure out where she is, yeah.

1:19:03.197 --> 1:19:05.072
Wait! Ah.

1:19:05.158 --> 1:19:06.615
I have a tracker on my phone

1:19:06.701 --> 1:19:10.578
in case I need to get
to one of our joint clients.

1:19:10.621 --> 1:19:13.456
-She's way the hell out there.
-Oh? Is that her?

1:19:13.541 --> 1:19:16.625
I've gotta go.
I've gotta go get her.

1:19:16.711 --> 1:19:20.379
Uh, w-wait, wait a second.
Um, uh, I'll go with you.

1:19:20.423 --> 1:19:23.257
-I just have to get one thing.
-[becca] okay. Okay.

1:19:25.636 --> 1:19:28.596
[dramatic music]

1:19:36.898 --> 1:19:38.606
what? You're not hungry?

1:19:45.907 --> 1:19:48.616
I want out, mark.
I want to leave.

1:19:50.328 --> 1:19:52.286
I don't wanna
be with you anymore.

1:19:56.542 --> 1:19:57.458
Fine.

1:20:00.129 --> 1:20:03.214
But let me say something.

1:20:03.299 --> 1:20:04.882
Liv tried to leave me
on her own terms.

1:20:04.967 --> 1:20:07.676
I think you know that.

1:20:07.762 --> 1:20:10.971
But in the end, she was weak,
and she came back.

1:20:13.309 --> 1:20:16.477
Was she weak
because of what you did to her?

1:20:16.521 --> 1:20:20.356
Did you poison her?
Her body? Her mind?

1:20:20.441 --> 1:20:24.109
-A bit of both?
-I don't like that question.

1:20:24.195 --> 1:20:25.528
Makes me feel like
you've already made your mind up

1:20:25.613 --> 1:20:29.240
about me. But I can be good
to you, amelia.

1:20:29.325 --> 1:20:31.826
I have been good to you.

1:20:31.911 --> 1:20:35.162
You say I protect you.

1:20:35.248 --> 1:20:38.165
But if I'm no longer here,
who's gonna protect you then?

1:20:38.251 --> 1:20:41.168
Who do you protect me from? You?

1:20:41.254 --> 1:20:43.170
[scoffs]

1:20:43.214 --> 1:20:45.548
from yourself, more like it.

1:20:45.633 --> 1:20:47.341
I simply pointed out
your weaknesses,

1:20:47.385 --> 1:20:48.384
and you didn't like it.

1:20:48.469 --> 1:20:50.177
You took everything from me.

1:20:50.263 --> 1:20:53.597
Well, let's not give me
all the credit for that.

1:20:53.683 --> 1:20:56.475
You wouldn't be here
if you didn't have it in you.

1:20:56.561 --> 1:20:59.854
You made every decision.
Don't put that on me.

1:20:59.897 --> 1:21:01.605
You wanna talk about blame?

1:21:01.691 --> 1:21:04.900
How about the fact
that you lied to me?

1:21:04.986 --> 1:21:09.530
You left me stranded
and clueless and heartbroken.

1:21:10.992 --> 1:21:14.201
You made me this way.

1:21:14.245 --> 1:21:17.496
And, honestly, liv might still
be alive if it wasn't for you.

1:21:17.582 --> 1:21:18.873
Vicki, too.

1:21:20.293 --> 1:21:21.959
How selfish you are.

1:21:23.588 --> 1:21:25.838
I was so afraid
of being hurt like that again,

1:21:25.923 --> 1:21:27.464
I couldn't let it happen.

1:21:27.550 --> 1:21:29.758
I won't let it happen.

1:21:29.844 --> 1:21:31.552
You killed vicki, too.

1:21:33.514 --> 1:21:35.264
You won't get away with this.

1:21:35.349 --> 1:21:37.558
Well, I did it
with your box cutter.

1:21:37.643 --> 1:21:39.727
And you were the only one
someone might have seen there,

1:21:39.812 --> 1:21:42.229
as far as I'm concerned.

1:21:42.273 --> 1:21:44.523
So think about it.

1:21:44.609 --> 1:21:48.402
I'm still protecting you,
the only one who can

1:21:48.487 --> 1:21:49.945
and the only one who will.

1:21:50.031 --> 1:21:51.906
So will I let you leave?

1:21:53.409 --> 1:21:56.660
Go ahead. Sure.

1:21:56.746 --> 1:21:59.496
But the moment you step out
that cabin door,

1:21:59.582 --> 1:22:01.749
no one is going to protect you,

1:22:01.792 --> 1:22:05.002
and I'm gonna come for you.

1:22:05.087 --> 1:22:06.587
And that's something
you're gonna have to live with

1:22:06.631 --> 1:22:09.256
for the rest of your life.

1:22:09.342 --> 1:22:11.800
Because you can't go to
the police, you'll go to jail.

1:22:11.886 --> 1:22:14.595
So you can't do that.
But you can leave.

1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:18.390
Or you can stay.

1:22:18.476 --> 1:22:20.684
You can stay
and feel protected and safe

1:22:20.770 --> 1:22:22.895
knowing I'm the only one
who can hurt you,

1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:26.774
but I'm choosing not to so long
as you choose not to hurt me.

1:22:30.363 --> 1:22:32.279
Sounds like
a pretty easy decision.

1:22:57.473 --> 1:23:00.391
[intense music]

1:23:14.115 --> 1:23:16.323
you know, you asked for this.

1:23:19.412 --> 1:23:21.662
I could use this on your wrists.

1:23:21.706 --> 1:23:23.998
Make it look like
a murder suicide.

1:23:27.753 --> 1:23:29.837
Are you ready to come back yet?

1:23:31.090 --> 1:23:33.674
Do you like how this feels?

1:23:33.759 --> 1:23:35.509
The chaos?

1:23:41.684 --> 1:23:43.934
[music continues]

1:24:00.911 --> 1:24:03.495
-[becca sighs]
-is this the right place?

1:24:03.581 --> 1:24:06.415
The pin was all over the place
all day today.

1:24:06.500 --> 1:24:08.751
Yeah, I-I think this is it.

1:24:08.836 --> 1:24:11.378
But it hasn't moved
for a while now.

1:24:11.464 --> 1:24:12.880
[door creaks]

1:24:20.473 --> 1:24:22.306
where have they gone?

1:24:23.267 --> 1:24:24.641
[groans]

1:24:24.727 --> 1:24:26.643
I suddenly feel less confident.

1:24:26.729 --> 1:24:28.520
[forrest] seems like
they're just here.

1:24:31.734 --> 1:24:35.235
More visitors. What a surprise.

1:24:35.321 --> 1:24:36.612
Where is she?

1:24:36.697 --> 1:24:39.573
[intense music]

1:24:39.617 --> 1:24:42.659
hey, hey.
All right, put the knife down.

1:24:42.745 --> 1:24:44.661
-What'd you do to her?
-Put the, put the knife down.

1:24:44.747 --> 1:24:47.664
You're asking
the wrong question.

1:24:47.750 --> 1:24:50.250
How about
what did she do to all of us?

1:24:50.294 --> 1:24:51.668
I mean, come on,
let's be honest.

1:24:51.754 --> 1:24:53.128
Meels can be quite manipulative.

1:24:53.214 --> 1:24:54.588
-No?
-You turned her against us.

1:24:54.632 --> 1:24:56.465
She had it in her
to turn against you.

1:24:56.550 --> 1:24:58.759
It was easy.

1:24:58.844 --> 1:25:01.637
What does that say?
And now look at us.

1:25:01.722 --> 1:25:03.639
[mark] abandoned yet again,

1:25:03.724 --> 1:25:08.227
leaving the two of you in danger
while she gets away.

1:25:08.312 --> 1:25:10.354
I wish I didn't have to keep
teaching her these lessons.

1:25:10.439 --> 1:25:12.523
-I really do.
-Put the knife down!

1:25:14.902 --> 1:25:16.360
Hey, hey, put the knife down!

1:25:16.445 --> 1:25:18.278
What the hell
are you doing here?

1:25:18.364 --> 1:25:21.156
What... What are you,
what are you talking about?

1:25:21.242 --> 1:25:23.534
So you two
were working together.

1:25:23.619 --> 1:25:25.828
[amelia scoffs]

1:25:25.913 --> 1:25:29.373
I should have known
you were right, mark.

1:25:29.458 --> 1:25:32.793
I'm so sorry.
You were protecting me.

1:25:32.837 --> 1:25:35.587
How did you know
where to find me, anyway?

1:25:35.673 --> 1:25:38.423
Your tracker on your phone.

1:25:38.467 --> 1:25:40.801
You left my phone on?

1:25:40.845 --> 1:25:43.387
Jeez, mark.

1:25:43.472 --> 1:25:44.972
I didn't realize.

1:25:46.517 --> 1:25:48.559
Why can't you let it go, bec?

1:25:48.644 --> 1:25:50.727
Because...

1:25:50.813 --> 1:25:52.479
Because you were too good
to be true.

1:25:52.565 --> 1:25:54.648
[forrest]
and now you're with him?

1:25:54.733 --> 1:25:56.900
Hey, after all we've done?

1:25:56.986 --> 1:25:59.444
What, now we're not good enough?

1:26:00.698 --> 1:26:02.281
Yeah. What he said.

1:26:02.324 --> 1:26:04.324
You're both pathetic.

1:26:07.037 --> 1:26:09.580
-Hey, hey, hey!
-You were right, mark.

1:26:09.665 --> 1:26:12.624
You're right.
I am safe with you.

1:26:17.423 --> 1:26:20.299
[whispers]
there is no other choice.

1:26:20.384 --> 1:26:21.967
Someone has to go.

1:26:23.721 --> 1:26:26.471
I'll remember those words
for a very long time.

1:26:29.727 --> 1:26:33.312
You know, for such
a seemingly good boyfriend,

1:26:33.397 --> 1:26:35.856
your love letters suck.

1:26:35.900 --> 1:26:37.316
You could have at least
tried to make it

1:26:37.401 --> 1:26:38.984
look like liv's handwriting.

1:26:39.028 --> 1:26:41.195
You got me again, meels.

1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:42.821
But this is the last time
I fall for you.

1:26:42.907 --> 1:26:44.448
Run. Run!

1:26:44.533 --> 1:26:47.492
[forrest] go, go, go, go, go!

1:26:47.578 --> 1:26:49.536
[mark] where do you think
you're going, amelia?

1:26:49.622 --> 1:26:51.830
-[mark groans]
-hit him again!

1:26:51.916 --> 1:26:53.498
-Hit him!
-Hit him!

1:26:53.542 --> 1:26:55.334
[forrest groans]

1:26:56.795 --> 1:26:58.045
[forrest groans]

1:27:00.549 --> 1:27:02.257
[forrest sighs]

1:27:02.343 --> 1:27:05.052
[amelia grunting]

1:27:12.811 --> 1:27:15.354
[amelia panting]

1:27:16.815 --> 1:27:18.023
[forrest groans]

1:27:28.702 --> 1:27:31.495
[becca] it's okay. It's over.

1:27:36.794 --> 1:27:38.710
For all these years
I've been promoting the idea

1:27:38.754 --> 1:27:40.963
that tidy makes meaning.

1:27:41.048 --> 1:27:42.798
But I've been wrong.

1:27:42.883 --> 1:27:44.466
Trying to keep a space organized

1:27:44.551 --> 1:27:47.344
<i> when the space</i>
<i> or the things in the space</i>

1:27:47.429 --> 1:27:50.430
mean nothing to you
is a setup for failure,

1:27:50.516 --> 1:27:52.766
<i> no matter how many</i>
<i> organizing hacks you try.</i>

1:27:52.851 --> 1:27:56.478
I challenge each of you
to take a good look around

1:27:56.563 --> 1:28:00.774
and determine what in your space
is really there for you.

1:28:00.818 --> 1:28:03.860
<i> Forget tidy,</i>
<i>if something is better for you,</i>

1:28:03.946 --> 1:28:07.572
<i> scattered across your floor,</i>
<i> then do that,</i>

1:28:07.616 --> 1:28:09.533
<i> if it's true to you.</i>

1:28:09.618 --> 1:28:12.411
<i> And, no, this is</i>
<i> not an excuse to be lazy.</i>

1:28:12.496 --> 1:28:15.914
This is a call to action,
to shake things up,

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.709
<i> to help you find</i>
<i> your own meaningful tidiness</i>

1:28:18.794 --> 1:28:22.087
<i> in an effort</i>
<i> to really be in your space.</i>

1:28:22.172 --> 1:28:26.550
<i> Because as I now admit,</i>
<i> meaning makes tidy.</i>

1:28:26.635 --> 1:28:27.968
<i> And on that note...</i>

1:28:31.932 --> 1:28:36.727
My book is now available
on shelves and online.

1:28:36.812 --> 1:28:39.646
I just want to say thank you
to each of you for being there

1:28:39.690 --> 1:28:42.482
and sticking with me.
See you soon.

1:28:46.113 --> 1:28:48.655
-[doorbell ringing]
-[gasps]

1:28:52.703 --> 1:28:54.161
-hey.
-Hi.

1:28:54.204 --> 1:28:56.872
When you said lunch, I thought
you meant at the office.

1:28:56.957 --> 1:28:58.999
I'm actually
taking the week off.

1:28:59.043 --> 1:29:01.585
Did I, uh, just lock lips
with a stranger?

1:29:01.670 --> 1:29:03.128
Um, oh, uh, I'm-I'm sorry,

1:29:03.172 --> 1:29:05.130
I must, I must have
the wrong address. Whoa.

1:29:05.215 --> 1:29:07.841
I apologize, um,
I'm-I'm supposed to meet

1:29:07.926 --> 1:29:09.676
my workaholic girlfriend

1:29:09.762 --> 1:29:13.388
who, uh, you-you alarmingly
look similar to, uh-huh.

1:29:13.474 --> 1:29:16.016
-[both chuckling]
-ha-ha.

1:29:16.060 --> 1:29:17.809
-Do you know an amelia sommers?
-Mm-hmm.

1:29:17.853 --> 1:29:20.103
-Oh, you do?
-I do.

1:29:20.189 --> 1:29:22.522
So is squirrel
about to implode as we speak?

1:29:22.608 --> 1:29:25.192
No, becca's there, she's got
everything under control

1:29:25.235 --> 1:29:28.111
now that she's my partner.

1:29:28.197 --> 1:29:30.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is, uh...

1:29:30.074 --> 1:29:31.573
This is cause for celebration,
right?

1:29:31.658 --> 1:29:33.867
Mm-mm, you better eat quick

1:29:33.911 --> 1:29:36.787
because I've got a massage
at 2:00.

1:29:36.872 --> 1:29:39.498
Okay, you, you know what,
you are, like, blowing my mind

1:29:39.583 --> 1:29:41.416
right now, all week.

1:29:41.502 --> 1:29:43.960
Better get used to it.
I got you one, too.

1:29:45.047 --> 1:29:48.048
[laughs]
you did? Nice!

1:29:48.092 --> 1:29:49.633
How thoughtful. Thank you.

1:29:49.718 --> 1:29:52.094
I am taking you with me
all the way,

1:29:52.179 --> 1:29:55.555
with some much needed space
and independence, of course.

1:29:55.599 --> 1:29:57.808
-Um, of course, all the way.
-Yeah. All the way.

1:29:57.893 --> 1:29:59.518
Well, does that mean
that I have to clutter

1:29:59.603 --> 1:30:01.478
my life again
to get you back again?

1:30:01.563 --> 1:30:03.980
Nah. I think I clutter your life
enough as it is.

1:30:04.066 --> 1:30:07.025
Okay.
Well, let's cheers to that.

1:30:07.111 --> 1:30:09.111
To not not cluttering
anyone's life.

1:30:09.196 --> 1:30:10.904
-Not cluttering.
-Cheers.

1:30:10.948 --> 1:30:12.572
Good. Yeah.

1:30:17.788 --> 1:30:20.705
[instrumental music]

1:30:50.779 --> 1:30:53.738
[music continues]

1:31:23.812 --> 1:31:26.771
[music continues]

1:31:53.342 --> 1:31:56.259

1:32:17.908 --> 1:32:20.825
