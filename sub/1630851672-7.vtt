He doesn't understand why Strand
would bring Morgan into tower.

47:30.691 --> 47:32.780
It is, in fact,
because he's lonely,

47:32.824 --> 47:34.652

in here,

Alicia.

Man,
why'd you let me in here?

47:40.876 --> 47:42.834
And the only reason
he wanted Morgan to come in here

47:42.878 --> 47:44.357
is because he thinks Morgan's
the person

47:44.401 --> 47:46.359
who can go out into the world,
find Alicia,

47:46.403 --> 47:49.449
