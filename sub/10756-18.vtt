Let me have a tall skinny to go,
please, and you can keep the change.

00:12.594 --> 00:15.711
Now, I've only got a moment.
I've taken on a very exciting project.

00:15.874 --> 00:17.387
- Oh, really.
FRASIER: Yes. You know,

00:17.554 --> 00:19.829
this is KACL's 50th anniversary.
I did a little research,

00:19.994 --> 00:23.304
found out that they used to
specialize in live radio dramas.

00:23.474 --> 00:24.463
So I'm putting one on.

00:24.634 --> 00:26.750
- Surely you must remember them.
- Oh, sure.

00:26.914 --> 00:29.348
Yes, people of Dad's generation
would sit around at night,

00:29.514 --> 00:31.584
listening to the radio,
absolutely mesmerized.

00:31.754 --> 00:33.551
We were a simple people.

00:33.874 --> 00:35.102
FRASIER:
All right, Dad.

00:35.274 --> 00:37.742
I spoke with the station manager.
He's given me 30 minutes

00:37.914 --> 00:41.270
to re-create the very first mystery
KACL ever aired.

00:41.674 --> 00:45.030
- "Nightmare Inn."
- Oh, don't tell me, I know.

00:45.194 --> 00:47.662
Bunch of people get caught in a storm,
and everybody's wondering

00:47.834 --> 00:49.313
who's gonna be
the first one murdered.

00:49.474 --> 00:53.513
- Exactly! And I'm going to direct.
- Oh, so we can stop wondering.

00:55.354 --> 00:57.151
You don't think he
knows how to direct?

00:57.314 --> 00:59.874
No, the trouble is he doesn't know
how to stop directing.

01:00.034 --> 01:01.752
<i>In our prep school production
of Richard III,</i>

01:01.914 --> 01:04.906
he drove the entire cast crazy
with his constant critiquing.

01:05.074 --> 01:08.225
I seem to recall a delay on opening
night while our Richard chased Frasier

01:08.394 --> 01:10.749
around the dressing room,
beating him with his hump.

01:11.394 --> 01:14.272
Niles, it was just a little backstage
horseplay to relieve tension.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.305
- Thank you.
- You have an Orson Welles complex.

01:16.474 --> 01:17.702
In the end,
you'll be directing,

01:17.874 --> 01:20.229
you'll have rewritten the script
and be playing the lead.

01:20.394 --> 01:22.191
I have no intention of
performing in it myself.

01:22.354 --> 01:25.630
The only rewriting I've done is simply
cutting, to get it down to 30 minutes.

01:25.794 --> 01:30.390
- "Frasier Crane's Nightmare Inn"?
- It's just a working title.

01:33.554 --> 01:36.626
Well, that's our show for today,
but let me remind you to tune in

01:36.794 --> 01:42.630
on Saturday night for KACL's
presentation of "Nightmare Inn."

01:42.794 --> 01:45.228
Just set your dials for goose bumps.

01:45.754 --> 01:48.314
Till then, this is Dr Frasier Crane
reminding you that

01:48.754 --> 01:53.703
you'll never know
what's lurking in the shadows.

01:53.874 --> 01:57.549
[LAUGHING]

02:00.314 --> 02:02.066
Well, that should certainly
comfort the woman

02:02.234 --> 02:04.623
who called in about her paranoia.

02:06.114 --> 02:08.389
- Do we have a leading man yet?
- No.

02:08.554 --> 02:10.590
- Well, you could do it.
- Oh, don't be silly, Roz.

02:10.753 --> 02:13.507
My God, it is a juicy part,
does call for a strong voice,

02:13.674 --> 02:16.427
- but believe me, my hands are full.
- Oh, Frasier,

02:16.594 --> 02:19.631
I've had a quick peek at your script,
and I think I'd be perfect

02:19.794 --> 02:23.264
as "Bull" Kragen,
the brutish gamekeeper.

02:24.234 --> 02:27.863
You know, Gil, I think that's just a bit
too on the nose.

02:28.034 --> 02:30.502
- Well, maybe.
- But you know what you could play?

02:30.674 --> 02:32.107
Yes. Nigel Fairservice.

02:32.274 --> 02:36.984
Drummed out of the Royal Air Force
under mysterious circumstances.

02:37.154 --> 02:40.305
With him playing it, they may not seem
so mysterious.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.029
I'll take it.

02:42.194 --> 02:45.345
After all, Nigel does have that
divine speech in the second act

02:45.514 --> 02:49.029
about his boyhood in Surrey:
"Romping with his school chums

02:49.194 --> 02:52.072
in the fens and spinneys,
when the twilight bathed

02:52.234 --> 02:55.032
the hedgerows like a lambent flame."

02:56.074 --> 02:58.952
Actually, I had rather a long
peek at the script.

03:00.794 --> 03:03.149
Gosh, we still have a lot of these
supporting roles to cast.

03:03.314 --> 03:05.669
Actually, I'm working on that.
Jennifer down in Accounting

03:05.834 --> 03:08.394
is married to a professional actor
who specializes in dialects.

03:08.554 --> 03:10.943
I'm thinking of asking him to play six
or seven smaller parts.

Hey, doc. Need one more
for your play?

03:13.434 --> 03:15.390
Absolutely, Bulldog.
Just as long as you promise

03:15.554 --> 03:18.193
- to promote it on your show.
- Actually, I wasn't talking about me.

03:18.354 --> 03:20.424
I was talking about a friend of mine,
Maxine.

03:20.874 --> 03:22.944
- Does she have experience?
BULLDOG: Are you kidding?

03:23.114 --> 03:25.787
If she had a dollar for every minute
she spent on stage...

03:25.954 --> 03:28.104
Oh, wait a minute. She does.

03:29.074 --> 03:31.952
Well, we do still have the part
of the maid. She only has one line.

03:32.114 --> 03:33.991
- Does it have any big words?
- No, it's simple.

03:34.154 --> 03:35.985
"Look out! He's got a gun."

03:36.154 --> 03:38.145
Maxine could knock that line
right out of the park.

03:38.314 --> 03:40.589
Well, okay, but you have to agree
to play a part too.

03:40.754 --> 03:44.110
We still need someone
for the sinister silk merchant.

03:44.274 --> 03:47.152
Okay, it's a deal. And Maxine
is gonna be so excited.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.033
I gotta remember to pick her up
one of those cute French maid outfits

03:50.194 --> 03:51.866
- on my way home from work.
- It's radio.

03:52.034 --> 03:55.344
- She doesn't have to be in costume.
- Maybe here she doesn't.

03:57.034 --> 03:59.502
- Well, we're getting there.
- Except for the lead.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.312
I haven't found anyone
remotely qualified

04:01.474 --> 04:03.669

Scotland Yard inspector.

- Take on the part myself.
IAN: Excuse me, Dr Crane.

04:09.314 --> 04:11.908

for the role of the inspector?

"a little man with a big secret."

- Hold it. Bulldog, where's Maxine?
- She's home with food poisoning.

just wrestled in some bad Jell-O.

up to that this evening, Daphne?

seems to be missing.

by 20 minutes, Gil.

defined Nigel's character.
