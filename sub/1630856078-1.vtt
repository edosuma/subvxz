12:10.668 --> 12:12.169
Buckle up.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.625
Okay, I have a plan.

12:34.726 --> 12:37.461
A plan? Where'd you have the
time to come up with a plan?

12:37.561 --> 12:38.528
Well, I read somewhere

12:38.629 --> 12:41.898
that luck is when opportunity
meets preparation.

12:41.998 --> 12:43.367
Hm, wise words.

12:44.401 --> 12:46.370
Well,
this might be my lucky day.

12:47.672 --> 12:49.774
True. What's your budget?

12:49.873 --> 12:52.409
Uh, a little over $300.

12:54.311 --> 12:55.178
Pretty tight.

12:55.278 --> 12:58.382
Yeah. But my horse is out there
somewhere.

12:58.482 --> 12:59.449
Waiting for me.

13:46.029 --> 13:48.465
Well, they say third time's
the charm, right?

13:48.565 --> 13:49.466
-Yup.
-Okay.

13:49.566 --> 13:51.803
Next one is right see
that driver right there?

13:51.903 --> 13:53.336
Right there. Mmhmm.

14:03.547 --> 14:05.115
[Charlie sighs]

14:06.450 --> 14:08.185
Okay, last one.

14:10.086 --> 14:11.656
Right over here on the left.

14:11.756 --> 14:13.290
Okay.

14:13.390 --> 14:22.097
[♪♪♪♪]

14:33.509 --> 14:36.245
[sighs] I really thought today
was gonna be my lucky day.

14:37.346 --> 14:39.281
What would you even done
if you had found one?

14:40.349 --> 14:41.751
Love it.

14:44.855 --> 14:47.156
[chuckles] Quit playing.

14:56.633 --> 14:59.703
[♪♪♪]

14:59.803 --> 15:01.170
CHARLIE:
Wait, stop!

15:01.270 --> 15:02.706
Did you see that horse?

15:02.806 --> 15:04.039
Stop.

15:16.051 --> 15:17.453
Seriously,
she could spook easily.

15:17.553 --> 15:19.823
So, you guys stay here.
I'm gonna get the wire cutter.

15:19.923 --> 15:22.024
-CHARLIE: Right.
-Right.

15:31.001 --> 15:32.568
Whoa, take it easy.

15:32.669 --> 15:33.770
Easy, easy.

15:35.137 --> 15:36.673
Dang it, Charlie, I told you.

15:38.107 --> 15:39.441
This could be dangerous.

15:43.245 --> 15:45.015
CHARLIE:
Pretty scary.

15:45.114 --> 15:46.515
It could have been.

15:48.417 --> 15:49.518
CHARLIE:
Hi.

15:50.820 --> 15:51.788
It's okay.

15:51.888 --> 15:53.088
You think you can hold him?

15:53.188 --> 15:54.658
CHARLIE:
Yeah.

15:57.994 --> 15:59.194
I think he likes me.

15:59.295 --> 16:01.430
CLINT:
I think he does.

16:01.530 --> 16:02.632
CHARLIE:
It's okay.

16:02.732 --> 16:04.834
CLINT:
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

16:08.605 --> 16:09.538
CHARLIE:
It's okay.

16:11.173 --> 16:13.208
It's one lucky horse.

16:13.309 --> 16:14.543
A little salve on those
scratches

16:14.644 --> 16:15.812
and he's gonna be fine.

16:17.681 --> 16:19.749
So, what do we do now?

16:20.884 --> 16:22.151
How should I know?

16:22.251 --> 16:23.653
Well, you're the grown-up.

16:23.753 --> 16:26.121
[chuckles]

16:27.356 --> 16:29.124
Well, he's banded
and that's the lead line.

16:29.224 --> 16:31.728
So,
he probably lives around here.

16:31.828 --> 16:33.462
We just need to find the owner.

16:34.864 --> 16:36.498
He wouldn't run away
if he was happy.

16:37.533 --> 16:39.101
They probably just left
the gate open.

16:39.201 --> 16:41.638
We can't just take him.

16:41.738 --> 16:43.807
We can't just leave him
on the side of the road.

16:43.907 --> 16:46.275
You told my mom the other night
that we could use your barn.

16:48.544 --> 16:49.545
You heard that?

16:51.380 --> 16:52.616
Dang it.

16:57.087 --> 16:58.354
Come on, boy.

16:59.488 --> 17:00.724
Come on.

17:33.422 --> 17:35.357
CHARLIE:
[indistinct speech]

17:56.079 --> 17:57.446
We did it!

18:00.050 --> 18:01.851
Isn't he beautiful?

18:01.951 --> 18:04.821
Beautiful isn't exactly the
word
that comes to mind.

18:06.990 --> 18:08.390
So, what's the deal?

18:10.392 --> 18:12.062
It's a long story.

18:12.162 --> 18:13.195
BETH:
I've got all night.

18:13.295 --> 18:17.734
[♪♪♪♪]

18:17.834 --> 18:20.369
BETH:
I thought you said there wasn't
a chance this could happen.

18:20.469 --> 18:23.006
-CLINT: here wasn't.
-Beg to differ.

18:23.106 --> 18:24.674
-What are you gonna do?
-Me?

18:24.774 --> 18:26.142
Yes. You did this.

18:26.241 --> 18:27.777
Wait a minute.

18:27.877 --> 18:29.478
No. You're in this.

18:29.578 --> 18:32.882
Well, I-- I meant what I said
about using my barn.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.417
Look, I'm not looking
for charity,

18:35.517 --> 18:37.654
I'm just looking for a solution.

18:39.055 --> 18:40.990
Let him stay here for now.

18:41.091 --> 18:42.391
Someone's missing
something this big,

18:42.491 --> 18:43.660
they're sure to miss it.

18:44.861 --> 18:46.129
I don't know.

18:46.228 --> 18:47.529
Let her have fun.

18:48.564 --> 18:49.999
I just don't want her
to get attached and then

18:50.100 --> 18:51.600
get her heart broken.

18:53.837 --> 18:54.871
I know the feeling.

18:56.706 --> 18:58.307
[sighs]

19:05.481 --> 19:07.016
She's a natural with him.

19:08.651 --> 19:10.519
CHARLIE:
I'm gonna name him Chango.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.421
CLINT:
Chango and Charlie,
that's cute.

19:13.957 --> 19:15.324
BETH:
Honey, we're gonna
find his owner

19:15.424 --> 19:16.926
and he's gonna have
to go home.

19:17.026 --> 19:18.228
You can't get too attached.

19:18.327 --> 19:21.097
CHARLIE:
Whatever.
He still needs a name.

19:21.197 --> 19:22.397
That kid is so stubborn.

19:22.498 --> 19:24.934
Yeah.
Wonder where she gets that.

19:25.034 --> 19:27.036
-Hey!
-Oh!

19:27.137 --> 19:29.404
Ha, ha. Easy, slugger.

19:29.505 --> 19:30.807
It's my pitching arm.

19:30.907 --> 19:32.976
Is it?
Oh yeah.

19:34.409 --> 19:35.845
So, Chango huh?

19:37.147 --> 19:38.413
Not a bad name.

19:38.514 --> 19:39.616
Let me show you something.

19:39.716 --> 19:48.323
[♪♪♪♪]

19:49.391 --> 19:51.027
Whoa.
Is that you?

19:52.262 --> 19:53.595
CLINT:
Well, long time ago.

19:53.696 --> 19:55.231
No big deal.

19:55.330 --> 19:56.565
Why'd you quit?

19:58.433 --> 20:00.501
Took a bad spill.

20:00.601 --> 20:02.470
Doctor said
I couldn't compete anymore.

20:03.972 --> 20:05.240
That was my lucky hat.

20:05.339 --> 20:06.909
Only wore it when I competed.

20:08.277 --> 20:09.611
Lucky hat.

20:09.711 --> 20:10.478
Did it work?

20:10.578 --> 20:13.447
It did,
until it didn't.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.785
I've only ever ridden English.

20:16.885 --> 20:18.153
I don't know Western.

20:18.253 --> 20:19.888
Can you teach me?

20:19.988 --> 20:21.389
I reckon so.

20:22.758 --> 20:26.360
It's not as easy
changing what you know,

20:26.460 --> 20:29.530
but want something bad enough,

20:30.999 --> 20:32.034
it's worth working for.

20:33.235 --> 20:34.870
I want it.

20:34.970 --> 20:36.038
Then let's do it.

20:43.312 --> 20:45.479
Maybe we should wait
a little while longer.

20:45.580 --> 20:46.982
Or Clint should try him first.

20:47.082 --> 20:49.017
Mom, I trust him.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.652
And he trusts me.

20:50.752 --> 20:52.420
Chango wants me
to ride him first.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.023
Tell you what,
I'll hold him,

20:56.325 --> 20:57.926
put your foot in the stirrup.

20:58.026 --> 20:59.360
Nice and slow.

21:00.863 --> 21:02.597
That's it.

21:02.698 --> 21:05.100
Now horses,
they like to mirror us.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.802
You can't tell a lie.

21:06.902 --> 21:10.739
So, if you're calm,
they're gonna be fine.

21:20.349 --> 21:22.017
That horse can take care
of her.

21:22.117 --> 21:23.285
BETH:
How do you know?

21:23.384 --> 21:25.153
Trust me.

21:25.254 --> 21:26.755
Troy always says that.

21:29.057 --> 21:30.926
I'm not Troy.

21:31.026 --> 21:33.695
I didn't lie to you back then,
and I'm not gonna start now.

21:33.795 --> 21:35.764
What do you mean,
lie to me then?

21:37.900 --> 21:38.734
I'm just saying,

21:38.834 --> 21:40.769
I've always been straightforward
with you.

21:42.271 --> 21:43.939
I got a good feeling
about this pony.

21:56.417 --> 21:58.353
BETH:
So, how was it?

21:58.452 --> 21:59.755
Like amazing.

22:00.689 --> 22:02.691
Oh, you think that was cool,

22:02.791 --> 22:05.027
wait til you try something
other than a jog.

22:05.127 --> 22:06.662
That horse has got some moves.

22:07.696 --> 22:09.932
Just remember, Charlie,
he isn't ours.

22:10.032 --> 22:13.434
We've notices all over town.
He could be gone any minute.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.503
So, you keep telling me.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.943
You know, Beth, this horse could
be sticking around.

22:22.177 --> 22:23.779
I wouldn't count on it.

22:27.983 --> 22:32.187
[indistinct chatter]

22:42.264 --> 22:45.233
ZACH:
Hey, heard you found a horse.

22:45.334 --> 22:48.236
I heard you found a nag.

22:48.337 --> 22:49.638
Where did you hear that?

22:49.738 --> 22:51.273
My dad works with Clint,

22:51.373 --> 22:53.275
I mean Mr. Holden.

22:53.375 --> 22:56.278
My groomer heard it
at the feed store.

22:56.378 --> 22:59.547
Great, everybody knows
everything around here.

22:59.648 --> 23:01.515
Come on, my yearbook class
is on your hallway.

23:01.616 --> 23:02.818
Walk with me and you can tell me
about this

23:02.918 --> 23:04.485
mystery horse.

23:04.585 --> 23:07.055
You've got to be kidding me.

23:07.155 --> 23:16.264
[♪♪♪♪]

23:23.071 --> 23:24.172
CLINT:
Atta girl.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.042
Still doesn't love the bit,
but he's getting used to it.

23:27.142 --> 23:28.076
Hey.

23:29.344 --> 23:30.544
Why doesn't he like it?

23:31.813 --> 23:33.682
See the scarring
around his mouth?

23:33.782 --> 23:36.184
It's from someone using
a hard bit and a heavy hand.

23:37.853 --> 23:40.088
Why would somebody do that?

23:40.188 --> 23:41.223
CLINT:
Well,

23:42.491 --> 23:44.126
some people think that
some horses

23:44.226 --> 23:45.994
need a little bit more control,

23:47.229 --> 23:50.332
but you still gotta do it right.

23:50.432 --> 23:52.667
Can't just jerk 'em around.

23:52.768 --> 23:55.270
And Chango's got a soft mouth.

23:55.370 --> 23:57.039
Don't worry, boy.

23:57.139 --> 23:58.740
We're not gonna hurt you.

24:16.491 --> 24:18.360
CLINT:
What do you think?

24:18.460 --> 24:21.096
Ready to do something
a little faster?

24:21.196 --> 24:22.831
I thought you'd never ask.

24:22.931 --> 24:24.733
CLINT:
Turn him around
and go the other way.

24:32.107 --> 24:33.341
I'm confused.

24:35.644 --> 24:36.945
CLINT:
A horse is all about feeling.

24:37.045 --> 24:38.647
They can feel a mosquito land
on their back

24:38.747 --> 24:40.882
in the middle of a wind storm.

24:40.982 --> 24:43.085
I don't get it.

24:43.185 --> 24:44.219
Gentle in what you do.

24:44.319 --> 24:45.854
But firm in the way you do it.

24:47.923 --> 24:50.358
All right. Use your legs
to steer the horse.

24:57.499 --> 24:59.634
The pressure from your legs
to steer.

25:02.471 --> 25:04.072
Gotta get your girl some boots.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.308
Can't keep doing this
in her sneakers.

25:06.408 --> 25:07.742
Boots are expensive.

25:07.843 --> 25:10.212
And we don't know how long
we'll even have Chango.

25:10.312 --> 25:11.913
Or whatever his real name is.

25:13.482 --> 25:15.383
There are some good
consignment stores.

25:15.484 --> 25:17.252
Probably get a pair
really cheap.

25:17.352 --> 25:18.353
[sighs]

25:18.453 --> 25:20.055
This is about
to get out of hand.

25:21.323 --> 25:22.691
It already is.

25:22.791 --> 25:24.960
I'm talking about Charlie.

25:25.060 --> 25:27.028
Uh-huh.

25:27.129 --> 25:28.830
We've had
signs all over town and

25:28.930 --> 25:30.966
still no response
from any of the flyers.

25:33.168 --> 25:35.937
CLINT:
You just start thinking about
a long-term plan.

25:36.037 --> 25:37.038
BETH:
We.

25:37.139 --> 25:38.273
We need a plan.

25:40.108 --> 25:43.010
You know, I got I lot of stuff
going on in my world

25:43.110 --> 25:47.381
than keep trying to find a home
for a lost horse.

25:47.481 --> 25:48.949
Like what?

25:50.451 --> 25:51.852
Let me show you.

26:11.872 --> 26:15.610
It's not much,
but I want you to see this.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.978
This is a work in progress.
Okay?

26:18.078 --> 26:20.014
-BETH: Okay.
-CLINT: All right.

26:23.384 --> 26:24.451
What is this?

26:24.552 --> 26:26.453
This is my workshop.

26:28.155 --> 26:31.225
I've dreamed that someday
I'm gonna open up a store

26:31.325 --> 26:35.329
and sell a bunch of furniture
that I make myself.

26:35.429 --> 26:36.730
It's a beautiful dream.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.801
That's not the most beautiful
thing in this room.

26:43.003 --> 26:45.839
I've always thought so since

26:45.940 --> 26:47.841
the day we first met.

26:47.942 --> 26:49.743
You did?

26:49.843 --> 26:51.879
But you were so into
what's her name?

26:51.979 --> 26:53.847
-What?
-What was her name?

26:54.782 --> 26:56.517
Mandy, oh no.

26:56.618 --> 26:58.620
No, she-- she--
I mean she tried,

26:58.719 --> 27:01.288
she was
a stage level five stalker.

27:01.388 --> 27:03.490
But we never went out.

27:03.591 --> 27:04.558
But Troy said that you
and her were...

27:04.659 --> 27:06.860
Well, he lied.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.830
Why didn't you ever say
anything?

27:14.802 --> 27:17.338
CLINT:
'Cause Troy was my friend.

27:17.438 --> 27:19.073
And uh,

27:19.173 --> 27:20.774
but you guys--

27:20.874 --> 27:22.042
you guys started dating
right away.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.179
And then you got married
and had kids.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.881
Oh.

27:30.685 --> 27:33.053
I don't know if you--
you noticed, but uh,

27:35.055 --> 27:38.092
I've gotten very attached
to you and the kids.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.829
I'm just not ready.

27:41.929 --> 27:44.198
And like you said,
Troy is your friend.

27:46.467 --> 27:47.835
Yeah.

27:49.036 --> 27:52.873
He had his shot,
and he blew it.

27:54.875 --> 27:57.811
But if you're not ready,

27:59.446 --> 28:00.914
I respect your wishes.

28:02.316 --> 28:03.817
Thank you.

28:05.853 --> 28:07.988
I'm hoping you'll have
a change of heart.

28:24.773 --> 28:26.206
How's it going
with your new horse?

28:27.676 --> 28:28.643
-What?
-I said,

28:28.743 --> 28:29.877
how's it going
with your new horse?

28:29.977 --> 28:31.845
Oh, way better.

28:31.945 --> 28:33.881
We've been practicing like
every day now.

28:33.981 --> 28:35.717
Have you heard about
the Junior Rodeo coming up?

28:35.816 --> 28:37.084
The what?

28:37.184 --> 28:38.085
Oh, it's so fun.

28:38.185 --> 28:39.654
There's a bunch of events
but uh...

28:39.754 --> 28:40.921
I do the calf roping.

28:41.021 --> 28:43.023
A lot of the girls
do the barrel racing though.

28:43.123 --> 28:45.627
I don't really know much
about that stuff.

28:45.727 --> 28:47.561
You can learn
if you start practicing.

28:47.662 --> 28:48.529
I mean I bet
Clint could teach you.

28:48.630 --> 28:49.830
He used to rodeo.

28:49.930 --> 28:51.633
Didn't you hear?

28:51.733 --> 28:52.900
She can't compete.

28:53.834 --> 28:55.770
She barely even knows how to
ride.

28:55.869 --> 28:57.938
-[friends chuckle]
-I didn't say that!

28:58.038 --> 28:59.573
Madison's just afraid
you'll beat her.

29:01.975 --> 29:04.445
You wouldn't stand a chance.

29:04.545 --> 29:06.146
Maybe I should enter barrels.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.015
I mean, I don't have anything
to lose.

29:09.550 --> 29:11.619
But somebody expecting to win?

29:11.720 --> 29:13.153
They have everything to lose.

29:43.550 --> 29:45.486
[grunts]

29:46.954 --> 29:48.723
We knocked it down
four times today.

29:48.823 --> 29:50.023
We're getting better.

30:06.573 --> 30:07.908
Oh.

30:08.008 --> 30:09.677
Whoa, boy! Whoa!

30:15.617 --> 30:17.451
Am I in trouble?

30:17.551 --> 30:18.919
Hardly.

30:19.019 --> 30:20.287
That wasn't half bad.

30:21.522 --> 30:22.824
A guy at my school said that
there's a

30:22.923 --> 30:24.626
Junior Rodeo coming up.

30:24.726 --> 30:26.460
Can I enter?

30:26.560 --> 30:29.029
I'd make a bet that that horse
has seen barrels before.

30:30.597 --> 30:33.033
I could teach you to ride him,
if you like.

30:33.133 --> 30:35.102
That'd be awesome!

30:35.202 --> 30:37.304
With permission from your mom,
of course.

30:39.741 --> 30:41.141
Of course.

30:42.610 --> 30:43.577
I don't like it.

30:43.678 --> 30:44.712
It's dangerous.

30:44.813 --> 30:46.380
Mom. Come on, I'm not a baby.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.816
You're my baby.

30:47.916 --> 30:49.717
Actually, it's a lot safer
than you think.

30:51.118 --> 30:53.020
I could teach her how
to do it right.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.254
And your school work.

30:54.354 --> 30:55.857
You already spend too much time
in the barn

30:55.956 --> 30:57.458
and not enough time
in the books.

30:57.558 --> 30:59.159
Not to mention,
her dad will never let her.

30:59.259 --> 31:01.161
-Yes, he will.
-BETH: Doubtful.

31:01.261 --> 31:02.931
Why do you always have
to pick on dad?

31:03.030 --> 31:04.064
BETH:
Charlie, if you only knew--

31:04.164 --> 31:06.333
Ask him to come out
and watch her ride.

31:08.035 --> 31:11.171
Fine. If your dad says yes,
you can do it.

31:11.271 --> 31:13.373
But if I see any problems
with your school work,

31:13.474 --> 31:14.676
it's over.

31:19.012 --> 31:20.915
Glad you two are satisfied.

31:21.014 --> 31:22.216
Ask your dad to meet us
at the barn

31:22.316 --> 31:23.717
when he comes to pick you up
on Friday.

31:25.853 --> 31:29.021
[♪♪♪]

31:31.991 --> 31:33.526
You doing your homework?

31:33.627 --> 31:34.527
Yeah.

31:34.628 --> 31:36.763
BETH:
Good girl.
Don't stay up too late.

31:36.864 --> 31:38.431
Okay.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.174
BETH:
You sure he's safe for Mikey?

31:48.274 --> 31:50.677
Oh, he takes care of his rider.

31:50.777 --> 31:52.646
He's a good horse.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.080
You're lucky to have him.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.883
BETH:
Well, he's not exactly ours.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.550
More like on temporary loan.

31:57.651 --> 31:59.585
And every day, Charlie falls
more in love with him.

32:00.988 --> 32:02.723
Maybe I need to find
something to distract her.

32:03.991 --> 32:05.759
-Like what?
-I don't know.

32:05.859 --> 32:08.896
Sleepovers? Friends? Soccer?

32:08.996 --> 32:10.530
I hate to tell you, but

32:10.631 --> 32:12.733
a few sleepovers ain't gonna
cure what she's got.

32:12.833 --> 32:13.734
And what's that?

32:14.902 --> 32:16.035
The girl's horse crazy.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.638
Ain't no cure.

32:19.472 --> 32:20.506
This is cool.

32:20.607 --> 32:21.975
If you really like it
and you practice,

32:22.074 --> 32:23.442
you could do it
by yourself.

32:23.543 --> 32:24.811
Want me to teach you,
Mini-Mike?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.347
Mom would never let me.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.617
We don't have to mention it
to mom.

32:30.717 --> 32:32.351
It'll be just me and you.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.452
Fun.

32:34.855 --> 32:35.889
Aren't you falling in love?

32:35.989 --> 32:37.691
What?

32:37.791 --> 32:39.392
With the horse.

32:39.492 --> 32:41.494
[whistles, clicks]

32:41.594 --> 32:43.062
Come on. Your turn.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.169
[sighs]

32:50.269 --> 32:52.204
I've never been on a horse
before.

32:52.305 --> 32:54.041
Trust me,
you're gonna love it.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.609
You keep saying that.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.444
-CLINT: Oh, look
-[chuckles]

32:58.544 --> 33:00.479
I'll tell you,
you look good on a horse.

33:01.581 --> 33:02.783
Thank you.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.990
Wow, Bitsy. I didn't know you
liked to ride.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.525
You guys. How's it goin'?

33:12.626 --> 33:13.827
Good.

33:18.632 --> 33:19.633
First time.

33:19.733 --> 33:23.235
Hey, it's uh-- it's great you
got my buddy there,

33:24.203 --> 33:26.006
giving you the ride around,
huh.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.842
I was just-- just trying to help
out.

33:28.942 --> 33:30.978
TROY:
Oh well.

33:31.078 --> 33:32.278
That's real nice of you, Clint,

33:32.378 --> 33:34.615
looking out for my family
like that.

33:38.085 --> 33:39.552
CHARLIE:
Do you wanna see me ride?

33:39.653 --> 33:40.887
Of course, angel.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.857
That's why I'm here,
isn't it?

33:50.129 --> 33:53.834
[sighs] So, no one's come to
claim it, huh?

33:53.934 --> 33:57.236
Nope. We put ads, and signs,
and flyers all over town.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.905
What else can you do?

33:59.006 --> 34:01.074
I don't know. Maybe uh,

34:01.173 --> 34:02.174
you shouldn't get too close
to something

34:02.274 --> 34:04.410
that doesn't belong to you.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.647
Someone's liable
to claim it.

34:06.747 --> 34:08.782
I'll take that
into consideration, Troy.

34:09.983 --> 34:11.283
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

34:12.886 --> 34:16.657
Anyway, I'm here to see if
my girl's a cowgirl.

34:17.924 --> 34:20.292
Giddy up. [indistinct speech]

34:53.592 --> 34:55.696
[Troy chuckles]

34:55.796 --> 34:57.363
TROY:
A good show.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.565
-So, can I enter the rodeo?
-TROY: Of course.

34:59.666 --> 35:02.301
I'm gonna have front-row seats
to see my girl win.

35:02.401 --> 35:05.072
Well, I probably won't win,
but it will be fun to compete.

35:05.172 --> 35:06.073
No, no, no, no, no.

35:06.173 --> 35:07.607
You are gonna win.

35:07.708 --> 35:08.842
Trust me.

35:16.149 --> 35:18.652
[sighs]
Well, that was interesting.

35:20.921 --> 35:22.388
I don't blame the guy.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.258
It's getting late.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.061
Do you want some help
cleaning the barn?

35:28.161 --> 35:29.428
It'll go by faster.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.566
Now, why would I want it
to go by faster?

35:34.768 --> 35:37.938
So, you can get rid of me
and have some peace and quiet.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.406
Tell you what.

35:42.042 --> 35:44.845
Why don't you let me
make you dinner?

35:46.213 --> 35:47.781
-You cook?
-Mmhmm.

35:47.881 --> 35:49.248
Hmm.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.650
A man of many talents.

35:51.718 --> 35:52.786
Mmhmm.

35:55.655 --> 35:58.158
But, if you remember
our most recent conversation,

35:58.257 --> 36:00.359
I'm just not ready
to change my mind.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.296
Woman, it is just dinner.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.732
I thought after today, you'd be

36:05.832 --> 36:07.934
too tired to go home
and cook yourself.

36:09.502 --> 36:11.238
And just would've been
really nice to be able to eat

36:11.337 --> 36:13.339
dinner with someone, but...

36:14.975 --> 36:15.876
It is tempting.

36:15.976 --> 36:17.576
Yeah.

36:17.677 --> 36:18.945
And I am tired.

36:20.714 --> 36:22.481
Alright, cowboy.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.851
But last one through the barn
has to clean the stalls.

36:24.951 --> 36:26.887
What? [chuckles]

36:26.987 --> 36:29.956
BETH:
[indistinct speech]

36:35.095 --> 36:35.862
-Oh.
-Oh.

36:35.962 --> 36:37.898
-Sorry.
-No, you're good.

36:37.998 --> 36:38.899
What's so interesting?

36:38.999 --> 36:40.934
Oh, just a little light reading.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.401
So, you're really gonna do it.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.205
I mean, I'll enter. But I don't
know how well I'll do.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.306
-Well how's your training going?
-Pretty good.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.709
I feel like Chango's the one
teaching me the barrels.

36:49.810 --> 36:52.311
Stay with it. I can't wait to
see you beat Madison.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.214
Well, that's not why
I'm doing it.

36:54.313 --> 36:57.050
Yeah, but it would feel
pretty good.

36:57.150 --> 36:58.285
We should go riding sometime.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.253
I know some nice trails
around Clint's place.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.321
What are you doing Saturday?

37:02.421 --> 37:05.457
Um, practice, and chores,
and stuff.

37:05.558 --> 37:06.725
Well, see if it's cool

37:06.826 --> 37:09.161
and I'll ride over
in the afternoon and get you.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.230
Sounds like fun.

37:11.329 --> 37:12.765
-Bye.
-Bye.

37:19.839 --> 37:22.507
Mom, Charlie's falling asleep
at the table again.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.576
BETH:
Mikey, don't tattle.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.111
Charlie, go take a shower.

37:26.212 --> 37:28.080
It's late
and you smell like a barn.

37:28.180 --> 37:30.816
It's my favorite smell.
They should make a perfume.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.085
Oh yeah, I bet that would be
a big seller.

37:33.185 --> 37:34.620
Now go get cleaned up.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.788
I'd buy it.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.859
[♪♪♪]

38:19.698 --> 38:20.833
Here.

38:22.268 --> 38:23.936
Hey Mr. Holden!

38:24.036 --> 38:26.071
Hey, Zach! How're you doing?

38:26.171 --> 38:28.874
What's your pa up
to this weekend?

38:28.974 --> 38:30.441
Well, he's...

38:30.541 --> 38:31.542
he's cutting fields,

38:31.644 --> 38:33.511
but mom says if he gets done
on time,

38:33.612 --> 38:35.247
he can watch the ball game.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.349
"Happy wife, happy life".

38:37.448 --> 38:40.119
Yes, sir. I've heard my mom use
that one before.

38:40.219 --> 38:41.153
How's it going, Charlie?

38:41.253 --> 38:42.420
CHARLIE:
Hi, Zach.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.656
Your horse is kind
of a beast.

38:43.756 --> 38:46.258
Oh yeah. Hercules is my buddy
for sure.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.558
Hercules?

38:47.660 --> 38:50.963
Oh, was... his real name is
something long and fancy

38:51.063 --> 38:52.631
that I can never remember, but

38:52.731 --> 38:54.633
I knew he was a Hercules
on the inside.

38:56.235 --> 38:57.736
This is a first for Chango.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.039
So, he's not used to it.
Slow and steady.

39:00.139 --> 39:01.907
Yes, sir.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.309
You can count on us.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.777
And don't come home too late

39:04.877 --> 39:06.577
or I'll get a hundred calls
from your mama.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.514
Yes, sir, we won't.

39:13.719 --> 39:14.987
So how come you transferred
to our school

39:15.087 --> 39:16.521
in the middle of last year?

39:16.622 --> 39:19.658
Well, um,
my parents got divorced

39:19.758 --> 39:21.293
and then when we sold
our old house

39:21.393 --> 39:23.162
we moved closer
to my mom's work.

39:23.262 --> 39:24.462
Must have been rough.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.298
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.133
Not easy being the new girl?

39:28.233 --> 39:30.501
Most kids are nice,
except for...

39:30.602 --> 39:31.637
-Madison.
-Madison.

39:31.737 --> 39:32.604
Yeah.

39:32.705 --> 39:36.108
Yeah, she's tricky.
But she's not all bad.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.110
Really?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.645
Okay, she's pretty bad but,

39:39.745 --> 39:40.713
I've known her
since kindergarten.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.982
She has her own stuff
to deal with.

39:43.082 --> 39:45.317
Her parents are super-rich.

39:45.417 --> 39:48.220
Oh, spare me.
Such a tough problem.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.722
Spend hardly any time with her.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.991
And her dad puts
all this pressure on her.

39:52.091 --> 39:55.427
-CHARLIE: For what?
-Everything. Sports. Grades.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.463
And especially
on her barrel racing.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.399
They got a whole stable
with trainers and staff.

40:00.498 --> 40:03.268
Still sounds
like a pretty good life.

40:03.369 --> 40:04.937
-Don't you get it?
-No.

40:05.037 --> 40:07.272
It's all work for her,
and then she--

40:07.373 --> 40:08.874
she's in trouble
if she doesn't win.

40:08.974 --> 40:11.310
She never gets
to ride for just fun.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.412
Yeah, it does sound pretty bad.

40:13.511 --> 40:14.947
No wonder she's so mean.

40:16.048 --> 40:18.150
Speaking of fun,
let's pick up the pace.

40:20.019 --> 40:21.387
Charlie, wait.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.055
Slow down!

40:36.869 --> 40:38.003
Charlie!

40:39.138 --> 40:40.571
Charlie, where are you?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.043
Charlie?

40:45.210 --> 40:46.145
Charlie.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.314
You okay?

40:49.415 --> 40:50.449
We took a tumble.

40:50.548 --> 40:51.750
ZACH:
What happened?

40:51.850 --> 40:53.218
Well, I was just trying
to go faster

40:53.318 --> 40:55.154
and he slipped on some rocks.

40:55.254 --> 40:56.554
We should call for help.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.191
There's no service.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.694
Alright, look he--
he should be okay, but

41:02.795 --> 41:03.796
just-- just to be safe.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.197
Give me your reins
and let's-- let's--

41:05.297 --> 41:06.698
let's get you back.

41:13.272 --> 41:14.606
[sighs]

41:14.706 --> 41:16.308
It just goes straight
to voicemail,

41:16.408 --> 41:17.810
whenever I call.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.082
I'm just-- I'm so sorry.

41:31.523 --> 41:37.162
[♪♪♪]

41:37.262 --> 41:38.730
BETH:
What happened?

41:38.831 --> 41:40.566
Where have you been?

41:40.666 --> 41:41.633
Why didn't you call?

41:41.733 --> 41:42.901
CLINT:
Beth, slow down.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.203
Slow down.

41:44.303 --> 41:45.404
BETH:
Are you okay?

41:45.504 --> 41:48.073
Mom, I'm fine,
but Chango isn't.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.376
Okay, well, let's get him in and
then we can talk.

41:56.348 --> 41:58.450
BETH:
How well you listen right now
is gonna play a big part

41:58.550 --> 42:00.519
in whether or not
you get to keep riding.

42:00.619 --> 42:01.987
Mom, you can't just do that!

42:02.087 --> 42:03.922
I care about Chango
more than anything!

42:04.022 --> 42:05.157
He's not safe.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.059
You could have got hurt
and you scared me to death.

42:07.159 --> 42:08.794
Mrs. Mitchell, it's--
it's all my fault.

42:08.894 --> 42:09.962
I wanted to go off the trail.

42:10.062 --> 42:11.663
I thought it would be more fun.

42:11.763 --> 42:12.764
She could have said "no".

42:12.865 --> 42:13.966
She didn't know the way back.

42:14.066 --> 42:15.701
And Chango didn't do
anything wrong.

42:15.801 --> 42:17.269
He just slipped on a wet rock.

42:17.369 --> 42:18.804
Wait, no, Zach.
No, that's not--

42:18.904 --> 42:20.607
It was my responsibility.

42:20.706 --> 42:23.342
Please do not punish Charlie
for my bad judgement.

42:23.442 --> 42:24.776
Please.

42:24.877 --> 42:26.044
I'll think about it.

42:26.145 --> 42:28.680
But for now,
stay off that horse.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.883
Think of yourself as grounded.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.257
I think we should get rid
of him.

42:38.357 --> 42:40.092
Whoa, that seems a bit harsh.

42:40.192 --> 42:41.860
BETH:
Are you really gonna tell me
what's best for my kid?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.896
I wouldn't even dream
about that.

42:43.996 --> 42:46.331
Seriously, what do you think
any good parent would do here?

42:46.431 --> 42:47.766
You know, Beth?
I don't even know

42:47.866 --> 42:50.535
what it takes to be a parent.
But I do have a suggestion.

42:50.636 --> 42:51.736
And what's that?

42:51.836 --> 42:53.104
You can discipline to encourage

42:53.204 --> 42:55.573
or you can discipline
to discourage.

42:55.673 --> 42:58.276
Same for animals
as it is for humans, I think.

42:58.376 --> 42:59.877
What's that?

42:59.977 --> 43:04.282
Encouraging tends to feel better
and seems to last a bit longer.

43:04.382 --> 43:05.583
I don't know.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.619
I didn't sign up
for any of this.

43:07.718 --> 43:09.453
Look, this could have happened
to anybody.

43:09.554 --> 43:10.788
And Charlie didn't even
get hurt.

43:10.888 --> 43:12.190
And the horse took the brunt
of it.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.726
Maybe they deserve
a second chance.

43:15.826 --> 43:17.428
I'm not big on second chances.

43:20.498 --> 43:22.099
You think about it? Okay?

43:23.100 --> 43:25.536
He's gotta be on stall rest and

43:25.637 --> 43:27.205
hand-walking
for the next couple of days.

43:27.305 --> 43:30.141
Just don't make a decision
you might regret later.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.043
I'll think about it.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.828
How's it going, Charlie?

43:53.464 --> 43:55.566
-Why did you do it?
-What?

43:55.667 --> 43:57.068
You know exactly what.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.104
I didn't want you to get
in trouble.

44:00.204 --> 44:01.272
Why not?

44:03.174 --> 44:04.542
You know why.

44:04.643 --> 44:06.177
I like you.

44:06.277 --> 44:07.311
And I like you, too?

44:08.512 --> 44:10.982
No, I mean I like you,
like you.

44:14.885 --> 44:16.187
We're talking here.

44:16.287 --> 44:17.455
It's my desk.

44:17.555 --> 44:19.890
Hey, just chill for a minute. Go
sharpen a pencil or something.

44:24.762 --> 44:25.731
As you were saying...

44:25.830 --> 44:27.598
What was I saying?

44:27.699 --> 44:29.500
That you like me.

44:29.601 --> 44:31.402
That that you like me,
like me.

44:34.305 --> 44:35.573
Is this some joke?

44:35.674 --> 44:36.642
Something you
and Madison made up

44:36.742 --> 44:38.610
to make me look like an idiot?

44:38.710 --> 44:40.077
Wha-- are you kidding me?

44:40.177 --> 44:41.979
Why would you even think that?

44:42.079 --> 44:43.749
I don't know. Maybe I've seen
all those movies,

44:43.848 --> 44:45.449
where the cool guy asks out
the geek girl,

44:45.549 --> 44:46.517
and then the joke is on her.

44:48.986 --> 44:51.856
If that's what you think,
just forget what I said

44:51.956 --> 44:54.091
and uh, keep on hating life.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.694
It's working out great
for you so far.

44:55.793 --> 44:59.497
[indistinct chatter]

45:06.170 --> 45:08.839
It's just too dangerous.
I think Chango needs to go.

45:10.341 --> 45:14.278
Mom, he was real nice
when I rode him.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.682
Once.
Once you rode.

45:16.782 --> 45:19.417
Actually, I have a few times.

45:19.517 --> 45:20.918
What? When?

45:21.018 --> 45:23.020
I just wanted to try.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.157
Plus, I kinda like hanging out
with Charlie.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.426
I like hanging out with you
too, squirt.

45:28.526 --> 45:29.894
So, now, you've both been lying?

45:29.994 --> 45:31.797
Mom, we were just trying
to spend time together.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.231
Yeah.
Yeah, quality sibling time.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.167
It's supposed to be
a healthy thing.

45:36.267 --> 45:38.469
I'm not too happy about
any of this right now.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.339
Look, just hear them out, Beth.

45:43.675 --> 45:44.875
First of all, I lied.

45:44.975 --> 45:46.110
I know.
You just said that.

45:46.210 --> 45:48.412
No, I mean about something else.

45:48.512 --> 45:50.848
You know, they say the more you
lie, the easier it gets.

45:50.948 --> 45:53.484
Well, I just sat there
and Zach took the blame for me.

45:54.753 --> 45:55.953
I'm the one who went off
on the trail.

45:56.053 --> 45:57.922
I'm the one who went too fast.

45:58.022 --> 46:00.124
I'm the one to blame
for everything.

46:00.224 --> 46:02.860
You're not making a real strong
case for keeping the horse.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.428
Mom, I love him.

46:04.528 --> 46:05.963
And he loves me, too.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.033
Please let me keep him.

46:11.869 --> 46:14.505
Fine.
But not one more screw-up.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.309
Now, let me get this straight.

46:18.409 --> 46:20.478
When you say you love him,
are you talking about Chango

46:20.578 --> 46:21.780
or the boy?

46:21.879 --> 46:23.914
-Zach. His name is Zach.
-What? No!

46:24.014 --> 46:24.949
-What?
-Which-- which one?

46:25.049 --> 46:26.250
-No, wait.
-I think it was maybe--

46:26.350 --> 46:27.619
-I thought it was Zach.
-No, no, no...

46:27.719 --> 46:28.486
Wait. Now,
I wanna know what this is.

46:28.586 --> 46:29.353
Are you talking about Zach?

46:29.453 --> 46:30.488
-I just-- I-- I--
-I think it's Zach.

46:30.588 --> 46:31.656
-No, no, no. I--
-She loves Zach,

46:31.757 --> 46:32.590
but she wants to ride the horse.

46:32.691 --> 46:33.591
No, no, no.

46:33.692 --> 46:35.259
No.

47:04.623 --> 47:06.056
For what it's worth,

47:06.157 --> 47:07.659
I think you made
the right decision.

47:08.894 --> 47:10.361
Why am I not surprised?

47:12.463 --> 47:13.698
Charlie, saddle up.

47:13.799 --> 47:15.599
We've gotta a lot of work to do.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.269
Rodeo is coming up fast
and we lost a lot of time.

47:20.471 --> 47:21.706
Mom?

47:27.344 --> 47:28.479
Mom?

CHARLIE:
Can we go faster?

47:36.587 --> 47:40.257
CLINT:
Not yet. We gotta do some yoga
for that horse first.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.928
What the heck does that mean?

47:43.027 --> 47:45.463
Just some stretching. He's got
to remember how to bend.

47:45.563 --> 47:48.566
Just start out with some
circles, both directions.

47:48.667 --> 47:50.334
Then we'll do figure eights.

47:53.971 --> 47:56.340
Alright, that's nice. Nice.
Nice and easy.

47:58.476 --> 47:59.678
Atta girl.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.952
I still don't see the point
in this.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.419
You want this?

48:08.519 --> 48:09.888
Yeah. More than anything.

48:10.020 --> 48:11.522
Then, do what I tell ya.

48:23.735 --> 48:25.336
CHARLIE:
Easy.

48:25.436 --> 48:26.403
Ah, okay.

48:26.504 --> 48:28.239
Here's one of the little things
that matters.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.440
When you're riding barrels,
look for the pocket.

48:30.540 --> 48:31.574
What's that?

48:31.675 --> 48:33.644
The area around the barrel.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.378
You wanna push past that.

48:35.478 --> 48:37.815
Horses always go where
their rider is looking.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.516
So, look ahead
to where I wanna go?

48:39.617 --> 48:40.550
Exactly.

48:41.785 --> 48:42.686
Anything else?

48:42.786 --> 48:44.587
Yeah. Have fun.

48:44.688 --> 48:45.588
No sense doing all of this

48:45.689 --> 48:47.524
unless you're having the time
of your life.

48:59.870 --> 49:01.739
Hey, dad, it's me.

49:01.839 --> 49:03.674
CHARLIE:
Uh, wanted to make sure
you remembered that

49:03.774 --> 49:05.676
my competition is next weekend.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.678
Call me back. Love you. Bye.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.581
You know, he may not make it.

49:12.883 --> 49:14.517
He said he'd be there.

49:14.618 --> 49:16.252
He might have to work
or something.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.188
Why do you always do that?

49:19.289 --> 49:20.323
What?

49:20.423 --> 49:22.125
Always think the worst
about dad.

49:23.694 --> 49:24.795
I'm just saying,

49:24.895 --> 49:26.329
don't get your hopes up
too much.

49:28.598 --> 49:29.833
He'll show.

49:37.675 --> 49:39.843
Hear you're competing
in the Junior Rodeo.

49:39.944 --> 49:41.045
Yes, sir.

49:41.144 --> 49:43.346
You never got a lead
on that horse you found?

49:43.446 --> 49:45.348
No, sir.

49:45.448 --> 49:46.784
Darndest thing I ever heard of.

49:46.884 --> 49:47.985
Hm.

49:48.084 --> 49:49.352
Well, good luck young lady.

49:49.452 --> 49:51.487

Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

49:51.588 --> 49:52.723
She any good?

49:52.823 --> 49:55.726
Got a better than fair shot
at surprising a few people.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.194
I expect I know who one
of those people might be.

49:58.294 --> 49:59.763

I'll bet you do.

You beat that Farnsworth gal,

50:04.902 --> 50:08.005
Johnson Feed Store might just
be your first sponsor.

Hey, Mr. Holden.

50:16.847 --> 50:17.948
Zach. How you doing?

50:18.048 --> 50:20.350
I haven't seen you
since the incident.

50:20.450 --> 50:23.386
Ah, about that. There's
something I need to tell you.

50:23.486 --> 50:24.989
That you lied about
what happened.

I told 'em.

50:26.957 --> 50:28.324
Great. Thanks a lot.

50:28.424 --> 50:30.661
No, no, no. I told them
that it was my fault.

50:32.562 --> 50:33.931
I still lied.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.666
Yes, you did.

50:35.766 --> 50:38.736
And you got to remember,
a man's word is his bond.

50:38.836 --> 50:40.838
Reputation is everything.

50:40.938 --> 50:41.905
Yes, sir.

50:43.172 --> 50:44.975
Fella must really like someone

50:45.075 --> 50:46.844
if he's willing to lay that
on the line.

50:48.012 --> 50:49.579
Yes, sir. He must.

50:51.081 --> 50:52.650
Well, we'd best get going.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.151
Good luck at the rodeo.
We'll be rooting for you.

50:55.251 --> 50:57.220
Oh, and uh,

50:57.320 --> 50:58.789
good luck with that
other thing, too.

51:10.233 --> 51:16.006
[♪♪♪]

51:16.106 --> 51:18.474
MR. WHITMAN:
Okay, everyone, books away.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.715
No more talking
till the bell rings.

51:27.283 --> 51:28.619
I'm sure everyone here remembers

51:28.719 --> 51:31.320
that this test is 30%
of your final grade,

51:31.421 --> 51:33.924
so it's a big deal.

51:34.058 --> 51:39.897
[♪♪♪]

52:43.559 --> 52:45.162
CLINT:
You're still slicing
that second barrel.

52:45.261 --> 52:46.230
When you let him turn
too soon,

52:46.329 --> 52:48.564
he's out of position
for the next one.

52:48.665 --> 52:49.800
Try again.

52:59.575 --> 53:01.111
Uh-oh.

53:01.211 --> 53:02.578
Hi Beth.

53:03.847 --> 53:06.382
BETH:
Charlotte Grace,
get off that horse right now.

53:06.482 --> 53:07.718
CHARLIE:
What's the matter, mom?

53:07.818 --> 53:09.620
BETH:
Did you really think
you wouldn't get caught?

53:09.720 --> 53:11.054
I'm so confused.

53:11.155 --> 53:12.689
Let me help you.
What if I told you

53:12.790 --> 53:15.058
I just got off the phone
with your Principal.

53:15.159 --> 53:17.560
Mom, I really don't know where
you're going with this.

53:17.661 --> 53:19.562
And why am I not surprised
you'd lie about it.

53:19.663 --> 53:21.131
It's not like we haven't seen
this before.

53:21.231 --> 53:22.800
Now, get off the horse.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.968
How can I lie when I don't even
know what I did wrong?

53:25.068 --> 53:26.335
Apparently,
your algebra exam

53:26.435 --> 53:28.639
came back with one of the
highest scores in the class.

53:28.739 --> 53:29.940
Get off the horse.

53:33.076 --> 53:34.178
And I'm in trouble for that?

53:34.278 --> 53:35.511
I had an A in there anyway.

53:35.612 --> 53:37.181
Your teacher didn't think
anything about it.

53:37.281 --> 53:38.816
Until he found out you cheated.

53:38.916 --> 53:40.918
What? Mom, I would never.

53:41.018 --> 53:42.585
Don't bother. He has proof.

53:42.686 --> 53:44.688
No, there must be some mistake.
I don't cheat.

53:44.788 --> 53:46.156
The mistake was letting you
keep this horse

53:46.256 --> 53:47.390
and spend so much time
out here

53:47.490 --> 53:49.358
that you couldn't keep up
with your schoolwork.

53:49.458 --> 53:50.459
Mom, what are you saying?

53:50.560 --> 53:51.460
I'm saying you're done.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.030
You're not coming out here
anymore.

53:54.497 --> 53:56.332
Beth, can we just
talk about this?

53:56.432 --> 53:57.835
BETH:
You stay out of this.

53:57.935 --> 53:59.036
She cheated. She lied.

53:59.136 --> 54:00.536
And now for the icing
on the cake

54:00.637 --> 54:02.973
she's suspended from school and
getting a zero in that class.

54:03.073 --> 54:03.974
Do you know what this means?

54:04.074 --> 54:05.575
Mom, I promise I didn't do it.

54:05.676 --> 54:07.343
Let's just hear Charlie's side
of the story

54:07.443 --> 54:09.412
and maybe we can figure out
exactly what happened.

54:09.512 --> 54:10.948
You know, I partially blame you
for this, too.

54:11.048 --> 54:12.015
Me?

54:12.115 --> 54:14.116
You just had to take her out
looking for a horse.

54:14.217 --> 54:15.483
Well, here, he's yours.

54:15.584 --> 54:17.086
-Take him.
-What? No.

54:17.186 --> 54:18.855
Beth, can we just talk
about this?

54:23.726 --> 54:25.294
BETH:
You know this is hard for me,
too.

54:25.393 --> 54:26.963
Yeah, I'll bet.

54:27.063 --> 54:29.065
It's not always easy having
to be the bad guy.

54:30.532 --> 54:33.368
Well, this one doesn't seem to
be exactly breaking your heart.

54:33.468 --> 54:34.637
Look, Charlie,

54:34.737 --> 54:36.105
you know I always want
what's best for you.

54:36.205 --> 54:37.472
And Chango grew on me.

54:37.572 --> 54:38.975
But you're in big trouble.

54:39.075 --> 54:42.477
I didn't do it!
I aced that exam on my own.

54:43.445 --> 54:44.579
Look, all I know is you lied
about

54:44.680 --> 54:45.748
being on the trail
with Zach

54:45.848 --> 54:47.582
and you lied about teaching
Mikey to ride.

54:47.683 --> 54:49.451
That was part my idea, too.

54:51.453 --> 54:52.822
I cannot believe this.

54:52.922 --> 54:54.924
I think I'm just gonna go
live with dad.

54:55.024 --> 54:56.225
No!

54:56.325 --> 54:57.760
You're not going to live
with Troy.

54:57.860 --> 54:59.527
Where's your dad been
through any of this?

54:59.629 --> 55:01.330
You just can't count on him
when the chips are down.

55:01.429 --> 55:03.099
Stop talking about dad
like that!

55:03.199 --> 55:04.532
You know it's true.

55:04.634 --> 55:05.868
He means well
for the most part,

55:05.968 --> 55:08.436
and I'll always love him
for giving me the two of you,

55:08.536 --> 55:09.672
but it's always a coin toss

55:09.772 --> 55:11.641
if he's going to be there
when it's crunch time.

55:11.741 --> 55:13.441
So, don't bring it up again.

55:25.187 --> 55:26.421
Hey.

55:26.521 --> 55:27.823
Charlie wasn't here today.

55:27.924 --> 55:28.925
BUDDY:
So?

55:29.025 --> 55:30.425
She never misses a day.

55:30.525 --> 55:32.728
Are you really trying
to figure out girls?

55:32.828 --> 55:34.429
Just give up now.

55:34.529 --> 55:37.066
Didn't you hear?
She got suspended.

55:37.166 --> 55:38.834
No way. You're joking.

55:38.935 --> 55:42.271
I heard that little Miss Smarty
Pants got caught cheating.

55:42.371 --> 55:43.839
No way.

55:43.940 --> 55:47.009
Apparently, Mr. Whitman found
her cheat sheet or something.

55:47.109 --> 55:48.110
She wouldn't do that.

55:48.210 --> 55:51.280
I guess I'm not surprised
you'd take up for that.

55:51.380 --> 55:53.049
Stop it. Just shut up.

56:02.992 --> 56:04.827
Mr. Whitman?

56:04.927 --> 56:05.962
Zach.

56:07.595 --> 56:09.365
What can I do you for?

56:09.464 --> 56:11.267
She didn't do it.

56:11.367 --> 56:12.467
Didn't do what?

56:12.567 --> 56:14.770
Charlie.
She would never cheat.

56:14.870 --> 56:17.606
Well, I found proof
to the contrary.

56:17.707 --> 56:19.875
What kind of proof?

56:19.976 --> 56:21.243
I can't say.

56:21.344 --> 56:23.511
You know teachers
can't discuss students

56:23.612 --> 56:25.147
with anyone but the parent.

56:25.247 --> 56:26.182
I know her.

56:26.282 --> 56:28.017
Well, I know what I found.

56:29.618 --> 56:31.053
How can I help prove
she didn't cheat?

56:34.690 --> 56:37.326
I guess we could have
a discussion about

56:37.426 --> 56:39.494
a "hypothetical situation".

56:39.594 --> 56:43.232
Fair enough. Now, tell me about
this "proof".

56:43.332 --> 56:45.368
Oh, it was good.

56:45.468 --> 56:47.803
Low tech, low risk.

56:47.903 --> 56:50.206
Not like some
of these other students

56:50.306 --> 56:52.041
that use cell phones
and calculators.

56:53.309 --> 56:54.710
So,
what was this low-tech thing?

56:56.479 --> 56:57.813
Rubber band bracelet.

57:02.685 --> 57:06.155
This. This is what I'm talking
about.

57:06.255 --> 57:07.589
That's not anything.

57:12.294 --> 57:16.232
Mr. Whitman, Charlie got set up
by someone and I know who.

57:16.332 --> 57:17.299
It was Madison.

57:18.501 --> 57:19.969
That's not possible.

57:20.069 --> 57:23.739
I mean, the-- the Farnsworth's
are a fine, upstanding family

57:23.839 --> 57:26.675
in this community.
Now look, son, you--

57:26.776 --> 57:29.211
you can't go around accusing
people just to save your friend.

57:30.413 --> 57:31.881
With all due respect, sir,

57:31.981 --> 57:34.717
I'm 100% sure
that Charlie didn't cheat

57:34.817 --> 57:36.619
and I'm gonna prove it.

57:36.719 --> 57:38.387
Charlie did it.

57:38.487 --> 57:40.423
Case closed.

57:40.523 --> 57:41.991
ZACH:
Fair enough.

57:42.091 --> 57:42.892
We'll see about that.

57:42.992 --> 57:45.161
I'm going to Principal Goodwin.

57:45.261 --> 57:46.362
MR. WHITMAN:
All right.

57:46.462 --> 57:47.997
Like I said,

57:48.097 --> 57:50.599
you can't discuss a student
with anyone but a parent.

58:07.983 --> 58:09.385
Mr. Holden?

58:09.485 --> 58:11.087
CLINT:
Hey, over here, Zach.

58:15.491 --> 58:17.293
It's awfully quiet out here.

58:17.393 --> 58:18.694
Yup.

58:19.695 --> 58:20.963
I heard what happened.

58:22.698 --> 58:24.166
What version?

58:24.266 --> 58:25.668
She didn't do it.

58:25.768 --> 58:27.069
I'd like to believe that, too.

58:27.169 --> 58:28.504
No, I'm-- I'm serious.

58:28.604 --> 58:29.705
She got set up.

58:29.805 --> 58:32.007
By Madison Farnsworth.

58:32.108 --> 58:33.409
Farnsworth?

58:33.509 --> 58:35.177
You don't say.

58:35.277 --> 58:36.612
I do say.

58:36.745 --> 58:42.852
[♪♪♪]

58:55.097 --> 58:57.233
PRINCIPAL GOODWIN:
You claim that Madison did this.

58:57.333 --> 58:59.635
I saw her and her friends
wearing the bracelets.

58:59.735 --> 59:01.170
I didn't see Charlie
wearing one.

59:01.270 --> 59:03.172
You should be looking
at their test scores.

59:03.272 --> 59:05.074
PRINCIPAL GOODWIN:
You just can't go around
accusing people

59:05.174 --> 59:06.175
of planting evidence.

59:06.275 --> 59:07.977
But you can go around accusing
people of cheating?

59:08.077 --> 59:10.012
And then kick them out
of school for it?

59:10.112 --> 59:11.380
It's school policy.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.016
Look, I'm not an expert here.
But in a court of law,

59:14.116 --> 59:16.585
you're proven guilty
by beyond reasonable doubt.

59:16.685 --> 59:18.521
So, if it's good enough
for the courts,

59:18.622 --> 59:19.989
shouldn't it be good enough
for a school?

59:20.089 --> 59:22.658
I'm sorry,
but without any proof...

59:22.758 --> 59:24.894
I do have proof.

59:24.994 --> 59:26.996
Is that enough to at least
make you ask some questions?

59:27.096 --> 59:29.098
BETH:
Reasonable doubt. Right there.

59:32.201 --> 59:36.071
Well, in light
of Zach's contribution,

59:36.172 --> 59:38.707
perhaps we can negate
Charlie's suspension.

59:38.807 --> 59:39.975
What about failing the test?

59:40.075 --> 59:41.810
What about it?

59:41.911 --> 59:43.979
Let her retake it.
And Mr. Whitman can watch.

59:44.079 --> 59:45.881
If she passes,
drop the whole thing.

59:45.981 --> 59:47.483
BETH:
Seems reasonable.

59:47.583 --> 59:49.018
Might owe an apology even,

59:49.118 --> 59:50.620
before suspending
the Farnsworth girl.

59:50.753 --> 59:52.354
Let's not get carried away.

59:53.756 --> 59:57.525
I'll let Charlie retake the test
and we'll go from there.

Why are we here?

Just wait and see.

01:00:27.488 --> 01:00:29.524
CHARLIE:
What is going on?

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.793
Charlie, I owe you
the biggest apology.

01:00:31.893 --> 01:00:33.696
I know you didn't cheat
on that test.

01:00:33.795 --> 01:00:35.196
I'm so sorry.

01:00:35.296 --> 01:00:36.665
You are?

01:00:36.764 --> 01:00:38.634
Zach and Clint
never doubted you.

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:39.934
Zach and I went
to your principal

01:00:40.034 --> 01:00:42.570
and we got everything
straightened out.

01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:44.305
How did you manage this?

01:00:44.405 --> 01:00:47.710
Well, we made your principal
an offer she couldn't refuse.

01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:49.377
-You threatened her?
-No.

01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:51.714
No. It's just an expression.

01:00:51.813 --> 01:00:53.281
What kind of criminal
do you think I am?

01:00:53.381 --> 01:00:55.783
I'm gonna sleep so much better
tonight knowing that.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:58.386
So, what happened?

01:00:58.486 --> 01:01:02.390
Well, we had a material witness
and a little bit of leverage.

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:07.028
Well, why don't we all just
bring it in for a group hug?

01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:09.264
Come on, everybody.

01:01:10.531 --> 01:01:12.800
-Bring it in.

01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:22.110
Okay,
Charlie, this is game day.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.178
There'll be
a lot of people there.

01:01:24.279 --> 01:01:25.213
CHARLIE:
I get it.

01:01:26.447 --> 01:01:28.717
I know you do.

01:01:28.816 --> 01:01:31.085
I just don't want you to get
intimidated

01:01:31.185 --> 01:01:33.421
by all the fancy things that
don't matter.

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:36.024
Like what?

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:40.094
It's gonna be a lot
of money there.

01:01:41.195 --> 01:01:44.032
Trailers that are nicer
than some people's homes.

01:01:45.066 --> 01:01:48.436
Horses that cost more
than most people's cars.

01:01:48.536 --> 01:01:49.504
Money doesn't mean anything.

01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:53.574
Well, money can mean
some things,

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.576
but it doesn't mean everything.

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:56.978
What counts is...

01:01:57.078 --> 01:01:58.513
Opportunity means preparation.

01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:01.983
Heart.

01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:04.185
Nothing can beat your heart.

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:06.554
You have all the heart
in the world for this.

01:02:09.758 --> 01:02:12.427
No matter what happens,
I'm so proud of you.

01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:16.164
ANNOUNCER:
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen.

01:02:16.264 --> 01:02:20.168
And welcome to the
State finals in barrel racing.

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:36.017
[people cheering]

01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:52.867
You ever play Pick up 52?

01:02:52.967 --> 01:02:54.837
-No.
-You wanna play?

01:02:54.936 --> 01:02:55.970
Yeah, sure.

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:57.639
We're gonna play it
all the way through.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.873
-Yeah.
-All right.

01:02:58.973 --> 01:03:01.075
-Mom, what's that?
-It's for you.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:02.310
Open it.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:05.947
No way!

01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:09.016
I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.

01:03:09.117 --> 01:03:10.952
I just wanted to make sure
you get to go to college.

01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:13.789
It's okay.
I was a total jerk.

01:03:13.888 --> 01:03:15.858
Whatever.
I'm so proud of you.

01:03:15.957 --> 01:03:17.291
Here.
Go, try this on.

01:03:17.392 --> 01:03:19.227
[Charlie chuckles]

01:03:19.327 --> 01:03:20.495
[chuckles]

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.371
Oh, wow.

01:03:30.471 --> 01:03:31.607
You look amazing.

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:32.573
CLINT:
Yeah, you do.

01:03:33.742 --> 01:03:35.309
You need to fuel up
before the ride.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.544
Let's go get 'em something
to eat.

01:03:41.182 --> 01:03:42.283
Whoa.

01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:44.720
CHARLIE:
What, Shorty McShort Shorts?

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.487
Doesn't exactly look like you.

01:03:46.587 --> 01:03:48.055
CHARLIE:
Is it bad?

01:03:48.156 --> 01:03:50.491
I don't know.
You just look fancy.

01:03:50.591 --> 01:03:51.627
Mom got it for me.

01:03:53.027 --> 01:03:54.897
Man, sometimes,

01:03:54.996 --> 01:03:57.733
I get emotional whiplash
from trying to follow you two.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:59.300
[Charlie chuckles]

01:04:01.002 --> 01:04:02.236
Hey, what's up?

01:04:02.336 --> 01:04:03.304
Are you mad?

01:04:05.874 --> 01:04:07.041
Not really.

01:04:08.242 --> 01:04:10.411
But I hate it
when you call me names.

01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:11.847
I don't call you names.

01:04:11.946 --> 01:04:14.415
Mini-Mike? Short Stop Shrimp?

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:16.417
Shorty McShort Shorts?

01:04:16.517 --> 01:04:18.019
I'm just kidding around.

01:04:19.353 --> 01:04:21.088
Well, no one has
to keep reminding me

01:04:21.189 --> 01:04:22.356
that I'm shorter than everyone.

01:04:23.558 --> 01:04:24.827
Aww, I'm sorry, bud.

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:25.993
I didn't know it was a thing.

01:04:26.093 --> 01:04:27.629
It's just my way
of showing affection.

01:04:28.996 --> 01:04:30.599
And a reminder
of my worst fear,

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:31.600
that I may be done growing.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:35.303
Dude. Never again.

01:04:35.403 --> 01:04:36.504
Okay, pinky swear.

01:04:39.073 --> 01:04:40.241
Pinky swear.

01:04:44.111 --> 01:04:46.247
So, you actually look awesome.

01:04:46.347 --> 01:04:47.916
You nervous?

01:04:48.015 --> 01:04:50.151
Yeah, I kind of just want
to go home.

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:52.420
Okay, what kind of example
would quitting set for me?

01:04:54.489 --> 01:04:56.557
I'm just joking.
Now go kick some...

01:04:56.658 --> 01:04:58.226
Hey!

01:04:58.326 --> 01:04:59.227
...butt.

01:04:59.327 --> 01:05:01.095
Jeez, what did you think
I was gonna say?

01:05:05.566 --> 01:05:06.534
Hey uh,

01:05:08.169 --> 01:05:09.805
have you ever heard
of Pick Up 52?

01:05:09.938 --> 01:05:15.243
[♪♪♪]

01:06:15.468 --> 01:06:17.237
You nervous?

01:06:17.337 --> 01:06:18.371
Yeah.

01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:21.274
I got something for ya.

01:06:38.793 --> 01:06:39.860
Isn't this your lucky hat?

01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:42.562
Not anymore.

01:06:49.036 --> 01:06:50.136
Remember what I told you

01:06:50.236 --> 01:06:52.372
about a horse being
a mirror for your soul?

01:06:52.472 --> 01:06:54.341
I don't think my dad made it.

01:06:54.441 --> 01:06:55.375
Later.

01:06:56.476 --> 01:06:58.244
Focus on you.

01:06:58.345 --> 01:07:01.181
All that matters right now
is getting to the next round.

01:07:01.281 --> 01:07:02.449
What do you mean?

01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:04.051
Well, a good time
will get us to the finish.

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.286
Anything under 19.5 should
get us there.

01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:09.489
Do you think I'm ready?

01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:17.430
You've asked me every which way
you can, Charlie.

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.834
There's only one thing
that matters.

01:07:19.934 --> 01:07:20.801
Do you think you're ready?

01:07:22.036 --> 01:07:23.370
Can you take this
to the finals?

01:07:25.138 --> 01:07:26.674
I think me and Chango
can do anything.

01:07:27.775 --> 01:07:28.809
Me too.

01:07:34.015 --> 01:07:35.850
[indistinct announcement
in background]

01:07:39.787 --> 01:07:42.222
Is that the horse you got
from the Lost and Found?

01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:44.457
Good luck with that.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.495
[sighs]

01:07:49.596 --> 01:07:50.563
Nice girl.

01:07:52.265 --> 01:07:54.501
[crowd cheering]

01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:27.835
Hey, boss.

01:08:29.003 --> 01:08:30.071
Hey, yeah, it's me.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:32.439
Hey uh, I got news.

01:08:32.539 --> 01:08:34.041
Mmhmm.

01:08:34.141 --> 01:08:35.308
You remember that horse,

01:08:35.408 --> 01:08:37.210
that little pony that
went missing a while back?

01:08:38.112 --> 01:08:39.113
Yeah.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:40.981
Yeah, well, I think
I just found him.

01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:42.215
Uh-huh.

01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:44.719
Well, I'm sitting here
looking right at it.

01:08:46.754 --> 01:08:47.722
On my way to rodeo.

01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:50.091
Yeah.

01:08:50.191 --> 01:08:51.591
Yeah.

01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:54.360
I thought you'd come over here
and take a look for yourself.

01:08:54.461 --> 01:08:55.395
You bet.

01:09:01.869 --> 01:09:02.903
Hey, Zach.

01:09:03.938 --> 01:09:05.706
Thanks again for getting me
out of trouble.

01:09:05.806 --> 01:09:07.440
Not many people
would have done that.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.210
It's the right thing.
I know you didn't cheat.

01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:10.711
Never doubted?

01:09:10.811 --> 01:09:12.245
Never.

01:09:12.345 --> 01:09:14.447
I think you're pretty awesome.

01:09:14.547 --> 01:09:16.549
Charlie, I've always thought
you were pretty awesome.

01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:26.026
CHARLIE:
Yeah, and then like,
Madison was just like,

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:27.194
"Good luck with that."
[chuckles]

01:09:27.293 --> 01:09:28.595
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:09:28.696 --> 01:09:29.964
-Come on.
-That's typical Madison.

01:09:30.064 --> 01:09:31.531
-That's so-- that's so dumb.
-Yeah.

01:09:32.499 --> 01:09:34.400
Hey! Let go of my horse!

01:09:34.501 --> 01:09:36.804
Hey! What's going on?

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:39.439
We seem to have confusion here.
This horse belongs to me.

01:09:39.539 --> 01:09:41.242
No, you're wrong.
Chango's ours.

01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:42.308
Mac? What's going on?

01:09:42.408 --> 01:09:44.344
Sorry, Clint,
but it all checks out.

01:09:44.444 --> 01:09:46.247
Mr. Buchanan owns the horse.

01:09:46.346 --> 01:09:47.748
No, you're-- you're lying.

01:09:47.848 --> 01:09:48.581
We found him ages ago.

01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:50.416
We put up flyers
and nobody came.

01:09:50.517 --> 01:09:52.318
Doesn't matter.
He's mine now.

01:09:52.418 --> 01:09:54.320
You lost him
and didn't even look for him.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.356
You only care now, because we
placed in the barrels.

01:09:56.456 --> 01:09:57.590
Maybe we can talk about this.

01:09:57.691 --> 01:09:59.292
We could buy him off you
fair and square.

01:09:59.392 --> 01:10:00.961
Nothing to talk about.

01:10:01.061 --> 01:10:02.495
At least,
let her finish the rodeo.

01:10:02.595 --> 01:10:04.031
She's in the finals on Sunday.

01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:05.733
Not my problem.

01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:06.901
Mac?

01:10:07.001 --> 01:10:09.369
Sorry, man. Nothing I can do.

01:10:09.469 --> 01:10:10.738
BUCHANAN:
Step aside, son.

01:10:22.116 --> 01:10:23.416
We'll figure something out.

01:10:32.126 --> 01:10:35.696
[cries]

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:46.707
Charlie, you've got
to eat something.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:47.975
I'm not hungry.

01:10:48.075 --> 01:10:50.711
Look, I know this is tough,
but we'll get through this.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:52.780
You never wanted me
to have him anyway.

01:10:54.648 --> 01:10:57.350
Charlie, none of us wanted you
to lose that horse.

01:10:57.450 --> 01:10:58.786
Trust me on that one.

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.131
I'm done with trust.

01:11:19.073 --> 01:11:20.807
Never thought I'd say this,

01:11:20.907 --> 01:11:22.709
but we've got to get
that horse back.

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:25.812
[sighs]

01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:36.723
-[sighs]
-CLINT: We need to talk.

01:11:40.459 --> 01:11:43.462
Why should I care about
anything you have to say?

01:11:43.562 --> 01:11:47.634
You used that horse
to get close to my family!

01:11:47.734 --> 01:11:50.303
You're the one who told Charlie
she could have a horse.

01:11:50.402 --> 01:11:52.338
You can't blame me
or Chango for this.

01:11:52.437 --> 01:11:54.374
I'm really pissed
at you right now.

01:11:54.473 --> 01:11:55.775
Yeah, I get it.

01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:57.610
Anger is a lot easier
to handle than grief.

01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:59.812
You don't know what it's like
to be me.

01:11:59.946 --> 01:12:05.517
[♪♪♪]

01:12:13.293 --> 01:12:15.361
[sighs]

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.197
All I know is Charlie needs us

01:12:18.298 --> 01:12:20.166
to work together.

01:12:20.266 --> 01:12:23.202
It's the difference about doing
the right thing or--

01:12:23.303 --> 01:12:24.637
or the easy thing.

01:12:28.174 --> 01:12:30.877
[sighs]

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.584
She's really good, isn't she?

01:12:41.821 --> 01:12:42.855
Yeah.

01:12:44.157 --> 01:12:45.658
She really is.

01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:49.528
Oh, God.

01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:54.033
[sighs] Sometimes, man,
sometimes I feel like...

01:12:55.567 --> 01:12:57.103
I really messed up.

01:12:59.906 --> 01:13:03.076
But I-- I look at her
and uh...

01:13:04.777 --> 01:13:06.713
And I feel like
I did pretty good, right?

01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:09.514
Yeah.

01:13:10.549 --> 01:13:12.185
You really did.

01:13:12.285 --> 01:13:13.485
You both did.

01:13:15.288 --> 01:13:16.588
She's a good girl.

01:13:17.857 --> 01:13:19.659
Yeah.

01:13:19.759 --> 01:13:21.661
And um...

01:13:21.761 --> 01:13:23.997
I'm-- I'm sorry
I should have come to you

01:13:24.097 --> 01:13:25.098
-and I should have like--
-You know what?

01:13:25.198 --> 01:13:26.199
Man to man...

01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:28.167
Yeah.

01:13:28.267 --> 01:13:29.302
[sighs]

01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:31.170
You've been a good friend
to me.

01:13:32.772 --> 01:13:33.873
You have.

01:13:34.807 --> 01:13:38.244
Just uh, treat her good, okay?

01:13:52.658 --> 01:13:54.360
What are we doing here?

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.895
Something you need to see.

01:13:59.531 --> 01:14:01.401
CHARLIE:
Why is dad here?

01:14:01.501 --> 01:14:02.769
Go ask him.

01:14:15.214 --> 01:14:16.548
What's going on?

01:14:19.519 --> 01:14:21.287
[Charlie chuckles]

01:14:21.387 --> 01:14:22.789
[Clint chuckles]

01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:26.025
So, how exactly did you two
manage to pull this one off?

01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:28.027
We took a page out of
your playbook.

01:14:28.127 --> 01:14:31.164
And we made Buchanan
an offer he couldn't refuse.

01:14:31.264 --> 01:14:32.065
So, you threatened him?

01:14:32.165 --> 01:14:33.599
-What! No.
-No.

01:14:33.699 --> 01:14:35.334
What kind of people
you think we are?

01:14:35.435 --> 01:14:37.904
Bitsy, I mean Beth. Beth.

01:14:38.004 --> 01:14:40.173
When Troy found out who
we were dealing with,

01:14:40.273 --> 01:14:41.641
he had heard the name before.

01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:43.643
Not just heard.

01:14:43.743 --> 01:14:46.512
Turns out this dude's got
a really bad reputation

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:48.448
for some pretty shady
business practices.

01:14:48.548 --> 01:14:49.649
You know what I mean?

01:14:49.749 --> 01:14:51.818
Troy says that Buchanan
works construction.

01:14:51.918 --> 01:14:55.955
Likes to cut corners and a lot
of other illegal activities.

01:14:56.055 --> 01:14:58.891
Yup. And I was on the receiving
end of a couple of those.

01:15:00.126 --> 01:15:02.795
Yeah. 'Course he didn't want
to sell us Chango at first.

01:15:02.895 --> 01:15:03.830
But...

01:15:04.864 --> 01:15:06.933
I told him it would be
a damn shame

01:15:07.033 --> 01:15:10.036
if word got out about
how he does business.

01:15:10.136 --> 01:15:11.871
'Specially to the State
Licensing Board.

01:15:11.971 --> 01:15:14.474
-That was a good one.
-[chuckles]

01:15:14.574 --> 01:15:16.375
It's weird how loss of income

01:15:16.476 --> 01:15:19.512
and uh, threat of prison can
change a man's heart, you know.

01:15:19.612 --> 01:15:21.814
Yeah. Started to see the light.

01:15:21.914 --> 01:15:24.884
Start to see things our way and
let us buy the horse.

01:15:27.787 --> 01:15:31.290
Anyways, he finally decided
to sell us the horse.

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:32.625
Seriously?

01:15:32.725 --> 01:15:34.393
How did you two do it?

01:15:34.494 --> 01:15:36.129
TROY:
Well, it's not impossible
for us

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:38.531
to uh, work together, right?

01:15:38.631 --> 01:15:39.699
You know this horse came

01:15:39.799 --> 01:15:41.934
into our lives
right when we needed him.

01:15:42.034 --> 01:15:45.204
It's a God-given thing the way
he brought us all closer.

01:15:45.304 --> 01:15:46.672
Healed us.

01:15:46.772 --> 01:15:48.574
TROY:
Hey, Charlie,

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:50.276
I'm really sorry
I missed your ride.

01:15:51.612 --> 01:15:54.347
From now on,
I'm keeping my promises.

01:15:54.447 --> 01:15:56.449
To both of you guys.

01:15:56.549 --> 01:15:59.852
Speaking of riding,
you and your horse are

01:15:59.952 --> 01:16:01.220
in the finals tomorrow?

01:16:02.188 --> 01:16:04.524
Well, but he's not my horse
anymore.

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:06.225
He's yours.

01:16:06.325 --> 01:16:09.428
Only thing is, we just happen
to have him for sale.

01:16:09.529 --> 01:16:12.031
For the very fine price
of $300.

01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:14.167
But we're only accepting
payment in coins.

01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:17.136
You don't happen to know
any prospective buyers, do you?

01:16:17.236 --> 01:16:18.437
I'll be right back.

01:16:28.581 --> 01:16:30.016
You've been carrying that
around with you?

01:16:30.116 --> 01:16:31.317
All this time?

01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:33.252
Well, you know what they say?

01:16:33.352 --> 01:16:34.453
What's that?

01:16:34.554 --> 01:16:36.856
Luck is when opportunity
meets preparation.

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:40.059
I like the sound of that.
That's pretty catchy.

01:16:41.394 --> 01:16:43.296
Deal!

01:16:43.396 --> 01:16:45.097

01:16:48.234 --> 01:16:50.136
You're gonna need this
for your feed.

01:16:50.236 --> 01:16:51.771

we are ready for the last event

01:17:39.784 --> 01:17:43.154
the Girls Barrel Racing Finals.

01:17:43.255 --> 01:17:44.456
I'm nervous.

01:17:44.556 --> 01:17:45.691
You stay here with Mikey.

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:47.525
I'm gonna go find Clint
and check on Charlie.

01:17:50.095 --> 01:17:52.163
Yeah, mom. You can trust us.

-Yeah. Come on, let's go.

they say people like you
are miserable inside,

01:18:13.418 --> 01:18:16.756
