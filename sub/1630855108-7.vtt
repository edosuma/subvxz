01:50.985 --> 01:54.156
<i>The scripture says
that he who is without love</i>

01:54.156 --> 01:58.576
<i>does not know God,
for God is love.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:04.208
<i>And we commend to His mercy
all who have loved and died.</i>

02:04.208 --> 02:06.542
<i>That Your will
for them may be fulfilled.</i>

02:07.668 --> 02:13.592
<i>As in baptism, Betty Gore put on Christ,
so in Christ, may Betty Gore</i>

02:13.592 --> 02:16.094
<i>- be clothed in glory.
- Candy?</i>

02:16.094 --> 02:18.931
Clothed in glory. Clothed in glory.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.766
<i>- Candy?
- Clothed in glory.</i>

02:20.766 --> 02:22.016
Candy.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.396
Are you ready?

02:32.528 --> 02:33.486
Did you hear me?

02:34.987 --> 02:36.906
I'm as ready as I'm gonna get.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.411
Do not hold anything back.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.873
If it even seems like you're hidin',
we lose.

02:49.710 --> 02:50.878
It's time.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.006
Mr. Crowder,
are you ready to proceed?

04:16.006 --> 04:17.633
Yes, Your Honor.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.593
The defense calls
Candace Montgomery.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.101
You heard Allan Gore's testimony.

04:29.101 --> 04:31.646
<i>Was his description
of the affair accurate?</i>

04:32.856 --> 04:34.233
Yes.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.070
<i>It petered out into nothingness?
It was over-over?</i>

04:40.905 --> 04:42.366
Yes.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.244
<i>There was no burning ember that made
you wanna get back together?</i>

04:47.536 --> 04:48.539
Definitely not.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.000
Calling your attention
to the morning of June 13th,

04:53.084 --> 04:55.003
why'd you go to the Gore house?

04:56.129 --> 04:59.049
We had plans to see
"The Empire Strikes Back."

04:59.049 --> 05:02.052
Alisa wanted to go, and
Jenny very much wanted Alisa to go.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.137
Jenny is your 7-year-old daughter?

05:05.137 --> 05:06.764
- Yes.
- And Alisa?

05:06.764 --> 05:09.517
Alisa Gore, Jenny's best friend.
She had stayed the night.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.228
Betty Gore's daughter?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.690
- Yes.
- And you and Betty were friends?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.815
Yes.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.818
Prior to June 13th of this year,

05:19.778 --> 05:24.240
had you and Mrs. Gore
ever exchanged any hostile words?

05:25.117 --> 05:26.869
- No.
- Had you ever had

05:26.869 --> 05:29.079
- any physical altercation?
- No.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.832
When's the last physical altercation
of any kind

05:31.832 --> 05:36.378
you can remember getting into
with anyone, other than June 13th?

05:36.378 --> 05:38.045
I don't think there ever was any.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.299
How about a verbal altercation?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.176
I can't think of any.

05:42.176 --> 05:46.930
To the best of your recollection,
you have never fought with anyone,

05:47.513 --> 05:50.934
either physically or verbally,
prior to June 13th?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.729
That's correct.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.939
So you went to the Gore house
that morning?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.859
To get Alisa's bathing suit.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.488
She had a swimming lesson that day,

06:03.488 --> 06:06.282
<i>and if she was gonna stay another
night, I would have to take her.</i>

06:06.908 --> 06:09.452
Did you call Mrs. Gore prior to going?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.330
<i>- No.
- Candy.</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:14.790
Sorry, Why call when you can
barge right in, right?

06:14.790 --> 06:16.167
How did she seem when you got there?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.254
She seemed a bit hurried.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.506
Hurried?

06:21.255 --> 06:24.842
She was planning for a big trip,
and she seemed anxious about it.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.261
- Did she invite you in?
- Yes.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.765
And what happened
after she invited you in?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.100
We

06:33.101 --> 06:35.019
talked about the movie plans.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.189
<i>I asked her if it was okay
for Alisa to go.</i>

06:37.773 --> 06:39.608
We talked about the swimming lessons,

06:39.608 --> 06:41.610
her upcoming trip.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.570
She introduced me to the new puppy.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.657
It was a normal, friendly conversation?

06:48.867 --> 06:49.826
Very.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.536
Until I was gettin' ready to leave.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.165
And what happened then?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.336
Well, I said that I should

07:00.628 --> 07:02.881
get going as I had an errand to run

07:04.091 --> 07:05.676
and suddenly, she blurted out.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.427
Are you having an affair with Allan?

07:09.638 --> 07:10.930
And what did you say?

07:12.807 --> 07:14.142
Yes.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.354
But it was a long time ago.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.732
You wait a minute.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.818
I thought maybe she had

07:24.903 --> 07:29.156
found a card or a letter
that Allan or I had written

07:29.156 --> 07:32.159
and maybe she just went to go get it.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.037
And when she reappeared?

07:39.543 --> 07:40.710
She had an axe.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.467
Were you in fear for your life
at that moment?

07:49.386 --> 07:50.429
No.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.098
Because I never dreamed
she would use it.

07:55.017 --> 07:55.976
So what happened next?

07:56.685 --> 07:59.229
Well, I said, under the circumstances,

07:59.229 --> 08:02.482
I should probably bring Alisa home
after Bible class.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.944
<i>- And she said:
- No, I don't wanna see you anymore.</i>

08:06.569 --> 08:08.739
And she put the axe down.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.948
<i>Had you ever seen that axe
before in your life?</i>

08:11.449 --> 08:12.491
No.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.953
<i>Did you even know
the Gores had an axe?</i>

08:14.953 --> 08:16.871
<i>- No.
- What happened next?</i>

08:16.871 --> 08:18.873
I went into the utility room

08:18.873 --> 08:20.917
to grab Alisa's bathing suit.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.879
And that was about the same time

08:23.879 --> 08:26.380
<i>that Betty had returned from
the bathroom with a towel.</i>

08:27.423 --> 08:28.383
And then what happened?

08:31.887 --> 08:34.806
She just looked so hurt.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.807
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to speak up.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.895
Betty looked hurt?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.357
I put my hand on her shoulder.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.651
And that's when I said,

08:47.194 --> 08:48.904
I am so sorry.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.032
And she did not like that.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.835
- You can't have him.
- Then suddenly, she had the axe again.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.253
You can't have him. You can't have him!

09:05.253 --> 09:06.505
I'm gonna have another baby.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.964
- You can't have him.
- Please. I don't want--

09:07.964 --> 09:09.967
- You can't have him!
- I don't want him!

09:10.591 --> 09:12.052
Betty, don't do this.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.555
What are you doing?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.892
Did you think, at that moment,
she was going to kill you?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.143
I still didn't believe she'd ever do that.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.939
But, at some point, your belief changed?

09:23.939 --> 09:25.690
- Yes.
- When?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.698
When she swung the axe up

09:35.741 --> 09:37.494
and it hit me in the side of my head.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.541
Can you describe
the force of that swing?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.586
It seemed with every ounce
of her strength.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.547
Were you now concerned for your life?

09:49.547 --> 09:52.092
I knew then that she wanted to kill me.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.428
And then what happened?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.683
I grabbed the axe.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.727
You--

10:25.334 --> 10:26.292
I thought I'd killed her.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.133
And then what happened?

10:36.011 --> 10:37.429
I just went to leave, but...

10:43.017 --> 10:43.977
But what?

11:00.285 --> 11:01.411
Let go of me!

11:07.543 --> 11:11.796
Please, I don't want him.
No, I don't want him!

11:14.382 --> 11:18.387
Please, I don't want him.
I don't want him! No!

12:33.712 --> 12:37.216
<i>Do you recall how many times
you hit her when she was upright?</i>

12:38.133 --> 12:39.634
No.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.637
What about when she was down?

12:44.222 --> 12:46.974
I just remember being afraid
that she'd get back up again

12:46.974 --> 12:49.018
so I kept hitting her.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.444
When you got to the Gore house,

12:57.444 --> 13:00.488
did you have it in your mind
to kill Betty Gore?

13:00.488 --> 13:01.615
No.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.243
After she hit you in the head
the first time,

13:04.243 --> 13:06.994
did you have it in your mind then
to kill Betty Gore?

13:06.994 --> 13:08.121
No.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.082
After she hit you the second time,
did you have it in your mind

13:11.082 --> 13:12.417
- to kill Betty Gore?
- No.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.668
When, if ever,

13:13.668 --> 13:16.504
did it enter your mind
that you had to kill Betty Gore

13:16.504 --> 13:18.339
to keep from being killed?

13:19.131 --> 13:20.466
I never thought about it.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.927
It just happened.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.725
After you stopped hitting her,

13:28.725 --> 13:30.269
what did you do?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.982
I walked around.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.861
I stood back and

13:39.945 --> 13:41.864
I looked at myself and I was

13:42.406 --> 13:44.323
covered with blood.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.995
<i>What were your feelings
at that moment?</i>

13:55.043 --> 13:56.961
I just felt so dirty.

13:58.297 --> 14:00.632
<i>I had to get the blood off.
It was making me sick.</i>

14:02.634 --> 14:03.760
I got into the shower.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.406
I just wanted to make it all go away,
but I couldn't.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.749
<i>And I kept thinking,
I have to be normal.</i>

14:37.252 --> 14:38.544
One thing at a time.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.173
Father's Day cards.
Swimming lessons.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.383
Movies.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.136
One thing at a time. Normal.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.933
<i>And when you left the house
and started to drive home,</i>

14:51.933 --> 14:56.604
what thoughts were running through
your mind at that moment?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.234
That it was all a mistake.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.070
Then it never happened.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.951
It just never happened.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.954
But it did happen.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.713
You killed Betty Gore with this axe.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.549
Sorry, please don't make me
look at that.

15:23.549 --> 15:24.799
You killed her with this axe!

15:24.799 --> 15:26.717
- Stop. Stop.
- You can look at it. Look at it!

15:30.430 --> 15:31.390
Do you need a break?

15:35.977 --> 15:36.936
No, I'm okay.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.355
I'm okay.

15:45.028 --> 15:45.988
Pass the witness.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.373
When you left the house,
the baby was there.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.335
Alone. With her mother dead.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.132
I wasn't thinking about the baby.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.594
My mind wasn't thinking at all.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.345
Well, it was thinking

16:12.597 --> 16:14.391
should get in the shower.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.642
It was thinking
should wash the blood off.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.062
When you left the house,

16:21.063 --> 16:23.316
you knew you had killed Betty Gore
with an axe, didn't you?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.068
I knew.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.779
And when you arrived back
at the church, you told no one?

16:28.447 --> 16:30.574
I wanted to pretend it didn't happen.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.285
Wanted to "pretend" it didn't happen.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.956
You "pretended" with your friends
and fellow congregants at the church?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.834
- Yes.
- You "pretended" with your close friend

16:41.834 --> 16:43.170
and former pastor, Jackie Ponder?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.505
- Yes.
- You "pretended" with your husband?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.341
You especially "pretended"
with the police.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.803
I was not truthful at first

16:52.721 --> 16:55.849
but I was lying to myself
just as much as I was lying to them.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.226
But you're not lying today?

16:59.770 --> 17:01.229
No.

17:04.066 --> 17:07.902
You said Betty Gore
went to the utility room,

17:07.902 --> 17:10.363
then appeared with the axe?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.241
- Yes.
- You didn't try to flee?

17:12.741 --> 17:14.618
As I mentioned earlier,

17:14.618 --> 17:17.329
I didn't think my life
was in danger at that time.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.207
But later, you did?
Why didn't you run then?

17:20.207 --> 17:21.707
At that point, I was blocked.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.710
What about the, the door to the garage?

17:23.710 --> 17:24.753
It was closed.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.674
Your Honor, may I approach?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.845
I'll show you exhibit 13.

17:38.015 --> 17:38.976
You recognize this?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.352
It's a lens to my sunglasses.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.062
- Sunglasses you were wearing that day?
- Yes.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.899
This lens was found

17:45.899 --> 17:48.818
in the garage. Did you go in the garage?

17:49.820 --> 17:51.237
- No.
- Never?

17:52.446 --> 17:54.615
I have never been in the Gore garage.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.743
Then how do you explain
the lens to your sunglasses

17:56.743 --> 17:57.952
being in the garage?

17:59.121 --> 18:02.957
Maybe during the struggle,
it somehow got kicked in there.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.794
It got kicked in?
While the door was closed?

18:06.794 --> 18:10.340
No, as I was trying to get out,

18:11.717 --> 18:13.050
I had opened the door slightly

18:13.050 --> 18:15.762
before Betty came back at me.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.556
And so maybe
it got kicked into the garage

18:18.556 --> 18:20.726
while the door was ajar.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.769
That's the only explanation
I can come up with.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.689
I bet you wish you could
come up with another.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.940
- Objection.
- First, you said the door was closed.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.110
Now, you amend it to "slightly ajar."

18:30.110 --> 18:31.903
Mrs. Montgomery.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.531
Are you pretending again with us now?

18:34.531 --> 18:36.658
- Objection.
- Overruled.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.951
Do you consider yourself
to be a good liar?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.704
- Objection!
- Overruled, and stop your nonsense.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.415
When you told your fellow congregants

18:43.415 --> 18:45.666
back at the church that nothing
happened at the Gore house,

18:45.666 --> 18:46.959
did they believe you?

18:48.336 --> 18:49.378
Yes.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.964
When you told Jackie Ponder,
she believed you?

18:52.715 --> 18:53.799
Yes.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.885
When you told your husband,
he believed you?

18:57.720 --> 19:00.349
- Yes.
- All these people believed you.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.476
You must be a very good liar.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.143
- Objection!
- And I would imagine if you could fool

19:04.143 --> 19:05.312
the people that know you best--

19:05.312 --> 19:07.189
- Objection!
- Oh, alright.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.654
He did damage.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.823
I should have done more with
that fuckin' sunglasses lens.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.075
We had a pretty good day.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.369
Nobody's buying Candy's testimony.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.746
- We don't know that.
- Are you listenin' to what's being said?

19:23.746 --> 19:26.374
The media doesn't get a vote.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.210
I was watching the jury
during Candy's testimony.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.045
They were hanging on every word.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.714
They seem to be with her.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.008
What about Dr. Fason?

19:35.801 --> 19:37.928
I'm not sure Judge Ryan
will find hypnosis admissible.

19:37.928 --> 19:40.264
Yeah, well, we have to try.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.807
Self-defense doesn't account
for 40 whacks.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.559
We need Fason.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.449
Honey.

20:03.745 --> 20:04.912
Mom?

20:07.082 --> 20:08.208
What are you doing here?

20:10.752 --> 20:12.087
Why are you here?

20:12.087 --> 20:14.214
You need to defend yourself, honey.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.508
Here, take this.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.616
Candy, what's wrong?

20:59.551 --> 21:01.010
Don, it's near midnight.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.180
I tried calling.
Why's the phone off the hook?

21:03.180 --> 21:05.766
We're getting prank calls.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.017
Well, I need to be able
to contact you both.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.310
Put the phone back on the hook.

21:10.020 --> 21:10.979
Why? What's wrong?

21:13.649 --> 21:15.566
Little change of plans.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.817
I'm puttin' you up next.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.195
Me? Why?

21:19.195 --> 21:20.656
This is Texas, Pat.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.534
Folks might be able to forgive murder.

21:23.534 --> 21:25.201
Adultery, not so much.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.372
I did forgive her. And do.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.499
In fact, I blame myself.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.920
- Why?
- The relationship with Allan

21:34.920 --> 21:38.131
was really more about
having someone to talk to,

21:38.131 --> 21:40.299
and I wasn't

21:41.218 --> 21:42.845
open enough with Candy.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.513
I wasn't sharing myself enough.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.349
Mr. Montgomery,

21:48.851 --> 21:52.187
when you learned what happened
in that utility room,

21:53.104 --> 21:54.981
you continued to stand by your wife?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.608
Of course.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.402
Yes. She is not violent.

22:00.194 --> 22:04.700
In fact, once the horror passed,
I felt some gratitude.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.825
I thanked God.

22:06.535 --> 22:07.910
You thanked God?

22:09.079 --> 22:11.248
Betty is a much larger woman.

22:11.248 --> 22:13.749
Add to that, she had an axe.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.252
Could have easily gone the other way.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.673
Candy is loving.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.592
She's not violent.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.135
For this to have happened,

22:24.970 --> 22:25.928
Betty came at her.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.223
Did your wife tell you what she'd done?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.892
I think she blocked it out.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.311
She lied to you. She kept it from you.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.646
I don't think she really remembered.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.232
She forgot about it, you think?

22:38.859 --> 22:40.152
It's not that she didn't remember.

22:40.776 --> 22:46.700
She knew she had swung the axe
but she suffered a dissociative reaction

22:46.700 --> 22:50.579
which can induce a form of amnesia
to suppress anger

22:50.579 --> 22:52.997
- and, in this case, shame.
- Hold on.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.209
Are you sayin' she suffered
from a mental illness?

22:55.958 --> 22:58.378
I'm saying she could not
reconcile her actions

22:58.378 --> 22:59.837
with who she believes herself to be,

22:59.837 --> 23:01.631
so she, in a sense, blocked it out.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.301
Can this explain why after,
when she went back to church,

23:05.301 --> 23:07.428
and then to Target
to buy Father's Day cards,

23:08.055 --> 23:10.806
it was as if this incident
had never happened

23:10.806 --> 23:12.518
in Mrs. Montgomery's mind?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.727
She knew that it had happened

23:14.727 --> 23:17.605
but by forcing herself
to go about her normal day,

23:17.605 --> 23:20.526
it was as if she were trying to erase
the reality of it.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.489
A portion of her personality was split off
from her consciousness.

23:25.489 --> 23:28.783
Dr. Fason,
I admit I am no medical doctor

23:29.743 --> 23:33.330
but when a personality gets portioned off
from somebody's consciousness,

23:33.955 --> 23:35.707
that sure as hell sounds
like mental illness to me.

23:35.707 --> 23:36.750
Approach, Your Honor?

23:44.090 --> 23:47.301
I don't recall you jumping in
with the prosecution's medical experts.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.180
I can pose questions to witnesses,
sua sponte.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.058
You know what sua sponte is, counsel?

23:54.892 --> 23:56.894
It's Latin for "my courtroom."

23:56.894 --> 24:00.190
We would like the record
to reflect your obstruction.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.317
You don't have to introduce
what I say into the record.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.193
You know why?

24:04.193 --> 24:06.655
'Cause if I said it,
it's already in the record.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.782
I'm representin' a woman
who may go to jail

24:08.782 --> 24:12.744
for the rest of her life,
so I'm going to perfect the record

24:12.744 --> 24:16.081
so that it accurately reflects
your prejudice.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.502
For that remark,

24:22.253 --> 24:23.546
this court holds you in contempt.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.131
You're already holdin' me in contempt.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.508
Well, I'm doin' it again.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.051
Another $100

24:28.594 --> 24:31.430
and 72 hours in the Collin County jail

24:31.430 --> 24:35.100
effective immediately today
once we stand in recess.

24:42.107 --> 24:46.778
Doctor, I'd like you to elaborate
on my client's dissociative reaction,

24:46.778 --> 24:50.240
if you possibly can without
being abruptly interrupted.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.492
Mrs. Montgomery couldn't fathom

24:53.492 --> 24:54.953
that she was capable of this kind of rage.

24:54.953 --> 24:57.497
In fact, this woman
has an anathema to violence.

24:59.041 --> 25:02.335
Candy Montgomery is also a person
who is excessively concerned

25:02.335 --> 25:03.878
with what other people think of her.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.132
This is a common personality
pattern with individuals

25:07.132 --> 25:09.342
who struggle with dissociative reactions.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.510
Doctor,
I'm going to instruct you to refrain

25:11.510 --> 25:12.596
from narrative responses.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.348
Answer only what Mr. Crowder asks.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.976
Is it common for individuals
who suffer dissociative reactions

25:18.976 --> 25:21.854
to be excessively concerned with
how others perceive them?

25:21.854 --> 25:22.897
Yes.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.901
It's partly why Mrs. Montgomery

25:25.901 --> 25:29.487
emotionally walled herself off
from the events of that day.

25:29.487 --> 25:32.281
It was only when I hypnotized her

25:32.281 --> 25:34.826
that she was fully able
to access her memory.

25:34.826 --> 25:35.993
How so?

25:36.620 --> 25:41.749
I was able to age-regress her
to the time when she first experienced

25:41.749 --> 25:43.418
a dissociative reaction.

25:44.253 --> 25:46.296
It happened when she was 4 years old.

25:47.089 --> 25:53.095
She was involved in a race of some sort
with a little boy who was older than her,

25:53.095 --> 25:55.763
and the winner got to pump
some water into a jar.

25:56.473 --> 26:00.060
She was mad because she lost
and she threw the jar into the pump

26:00.060 --> 26:01.519
and it broke.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.231
A piece of glass from that broken jar

26:04.231 --> 26:07.316
came back and hit her in the forehead
and she was bleeding down her face.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.444
When she was taken to the hospital,

26:09.444 --> 26:12.238
<i>she was very frightened
about what was going to happen to her.</i>

26:16.158 --> 26:17.828
And she was screaming.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.580
Her mother said...

26:21.498 --> 26:23.958
What will they think of you
in the waiting room?

26:23.958 --> 26:25.001
Stop crying.

26:32.926 --> 26:35.220
She relayed this to you
while under hypnosis?

26:35.220 --> 26:38.473
Correct.
She had no conscious memory of it.

26:39.391 --> 26:41.810
<i>Even under hypnosis,
she was very frightened</i>

26:41.810 --> 26:44.478
<i>of expressing the feelings
that she felt.</i>

26:44.478 --> 26:47.524
It took a very definitive suggestion
that when I counted to three,

26:47.524 --> 26:48.901
she would express those feelings.

26:50.152 --> 26:52.529
I counted to three. One,

26:52.529 --> 26:55.157
two, three.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.001
Honestly, it was a scream

27:08.670 --> 27:12.173
a sound, that I had never heard before.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.760
- Triggered by her mother saying "shh"?
- Yes.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.014
Is it any coincidence
that Betty Gore also said...

27:21.183 --> 27:22.142
It is not.

27:23.018 --> 27:25.395
I look at that explosion of violence
with Betty Gore

27:25.395 --> 27:29.398
as being the result of the anger
that had been buried within her

27:29.398 --> 27:32.735
and blocked off all that time
since she was 4 years of age.

27:33.778 --> 27:36.989
- When I told her that, she said...
- Oh, my God.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.325
Do you mean I killed my mother?

27:41.410 --> 27:43.704
Was she killing her mother in a way?

27:43.704 --> 27:47.167
No. She was defending herself
against an attack by Betty Gore.

27:48.001 --> 27:52.381
But, the depth of rage and violence,
that did in part come from something

27:52.381 --> 27:53.673
that happened with her mother.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.592
Let me ask you one final question.

27:56.343 --> 28:00.848
Did Candace Montgomery,
at any time during June 13th, 1980,

28:00.848 --> 28:04.267
knowingly, that is on a conscious level,

28:05.185 --> 28:07.855
intend to kill Betty Gore?

28:07.855 --> 28:09.772
I do not believe so.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.112
Your Honor, we pass the witness.

28:22.285 --> 28:24.579
Defendant hit the victim
41 times with an axe.

28:24.579 --> 28:27.958
She pulverized Betty Gore's face
into a soft mulch.

28:28.541 --> 28:33.422
Your testimony is that she did so
because Betty said "shh,"

28:33.422 --> 28:35.089
reminding the defendant of her mother?

28:35.089 --> 28:39.344
My testimony is that
she was defending herself

28:39.344 --> 28:41.846
against Mrs. Gore's attack,
and the violence

28:41.846 --> 28:44.808
unleashed a rage that had
been within her for decades.

28:44.808 --> 28:49.353
A rage caused by her mother saying
"shh" when she was 4 years old?

28:49.353 --> 28:52.399
Not necessarily caused by, but fueled by.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.650
So she's sane enough
to argue self-defense,

28:54.650 --> 28:56.612
but not sane enough to be responsible

28:56.612 --> 28:58.321
for chopping Betty Gore into bits?

28:59.656 --> 29:03.076
Again,
her initial impulse was to defend herself,

29:03.076 --> 29:05.704
but during the struggle, she lost control.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.625
Just so I'm clear.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.419
She knew she was hitting Betty Gore

29:13.419 --> 29:16.089
- over and over with an axe?
- Yes.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.382
And she was swinging it out of rage?

29:19.383 --> 29:20.552
- Yes.
- Thank you.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.268
So is it okay for us to talk now?

29:30.479 --> 29:32.064
Now that my testimony is over?

29:33.439 --> 29:34.399
It's okay.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.653
Why did you make me look
at the axe like that?

29:40.322 --> 29:41.865
I needed emotion.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.536
Our case is you had an emotional break.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.871
I needed the jury to see a flicker of it.

29:58.590 --> 29:59.549
So what now?

30:00.841 --> 30:02.052
Betty Gore had it coming.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.428
I need the jury to see
a flicker of that, too.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.471
You're jokin'.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.560
We can't risk her being too sympathetic.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.648
I wouldn't say she was mean, Betty,

30:15.648 --> 30:17.525
but she could be ornery.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.987
Snappish is how I'd describe her.

30:20.695 --> 30:21.822
I'll say she was mean.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.992
Betty Gore
could be quite confrontational.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.994
Can you give us an example?

30:27.994 --> 30:30.830
She would let out dismissive
snorts during my sermons,

30:30.830 --> 30:33.457
right out there in front
where everyone could see and hear

30:33.457 --> 30:34.626
'cause she was in the choir.

30:35.543 --> 30:40.923
And not long after I arrived at Lucas, she
told me to go back where I came from.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.428
- Betty Gore didn't like you?
- She hated me.

30:45.428 --> 30:47.263
Candy didn't like me much either.

30:47.263 --> 30:50.684
At least, not at first,
but Candy was cordial.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.269
Betty could be vicious.

30:52.269 --> 30:55.771
You eulogized this woman.
You called her a beautiful person.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.818
She was beautiful,
as are all God's creatures.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.777
But she had a streak.

31:04.573 --> 31:05.531
I pass the witness.

31:07.701 --> 31:08.868
As the hour is late,

31:08.868 --> 31:10.953
seems like a good time to take a break.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.204
For the day.

32:01.254 --> 32:03.089
What made him change his mind?

32:03.089 --> 32:08.428
Robert made an emergency call
to the Court of Criminal Appeals.

32:08.428 --> 32:11.265
Honestly, I wish he hadn't.

32:11.265 --> 32:15.143
If I did time during trial,
more ammo with the appellate court.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.186
Oh.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.482
Thank you.

32:37.624 --> 32:38.583
What are you doin'?

32:39.668 --> 32:40.668
We knew Betty Gore.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.423
Were friends with her.

32:44.423 --> 32:46.425
For you to just throw dirt
on her like that.

32:46.425 --> 32:48.552
I didn't do that.

32:48.552 --> 32:49.887
Yes, you did.

32:49.887 --> 32:52.346
You called her pastor to the stand,
to say what?

32:52.346 --> 32:54.349
That God was okay with this?

32:54.349 --> 32:57.059
I just established

32:58.437 --> 33:00.814
that Betty could be antagonistic.

33:01.731 --> 33:02.773
Which is the truth.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.901
This case is gonna be your legacy, Don.

33:04.901 --> 33:06.402
Oh, balls.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.489
Legacy is you live, you die.

33:09.489 --> 33:12.534
With any luck, it'll have mattered
a nick you did the former.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.870
This whole thing is gonna eat at you.

33:17.539 --> 33:19.625
It may rot at you.

33:22.711 --> 33:25.088
I got enough on my plate
without this shit, Carol.

33:42.564 --> 33:45.984
<i>Basically, the doctor said
she acted out of self-defense,</i>

33:45.984 --> 33:50.446
<i>and then transformed into
an unconscious killing machine.</i>

33:51.239 --> 33:53.824
<i>Even the victim's pastor
weighed in with a shot,</i>

33:53.824 --> 33:55.827
along with other parishioners.

33:55.827 --> 34:00.373
<i>God loves everybody.
And he loved Betty Gore.</i>

34:02.042 --> 34:04.544
All I said, she could be a handful.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.713
<i>I have never seen Betty
be unkind to anyone.</i>

34:07.713 --> 34:10.841
<i>She was a wonderful human being.
Excuse me.</i>

34:19.892 --> 34:22.145
It cannot be healthy for you
to be watching all this.

34:24.063 --> 34:28.067
I can't be in the room
until closing arguments, so this is

34:29.695 --> 34:31.530
the only way I know what's going on.

34:34.116 --> 34:36.367
I put all of this in motion.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.245
Betty's dead

34:40.746 --> 34:42.039
because I cheated on her.

34:42.039 --> 34:44.458
You couldn't have possibly foreseen.

34:48.045 --> 34:51.049
You won't survive if you continue
to punish yourself this way.

34:51.675 --> 34:54.761
I'm so grateful for your support.

34:58.055 --> 35:00.558
I just feel so alone.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.145
You're not alone.

35:04.605 --> 35:05.563
You're not.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.309
I'm not about to presume what you know

36:24.309 --> 36:27.479
but I think I can safely figure
that all of you can figure

36:27.479 --> 36:31.024
Candy Montgomery didn't wake up
on June 13th, 1980,

36:31.024 --> 36:33.359
with a plan to kill Betty Gore.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.780
She didn't cook her kids breakfast,
head off to Bible school,

36:36.780 --> 36:39.074
perform a parable in the sanctuary,

36:39.074 --> 36:42.285
drive out to Wylie to pick up
Alisa's swimsuit, and then say,

36:42.285 --> 36:45.913
"Hey, while I'm at it,
let's kill Betty Gore with an axe."

36:46.998 --> 36:49.208
That makes zero sense.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.419
Zero.

36:51.294 --> 36:54.548
What happened here
is not just the most plausible scenario.

36:54.548 --> 36:57.383
It's also exactly what Candy told you.

36:57.383 --> 37:00.345
She got there.
Betty was in a dark place,

37:00.345 --> 37:02.306
agitated that she might be pregnant,

37:02.306 --> 37:04.975
upset that her husband had left town.

37:04.975 --> 37:07.894
Then, after some odd
perfunctory conversation,

37:07.894 --> 37:11.105
Betty suddenly confronted
Candy with the weapon.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.190
A struggle occurred.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.192
Candy reacted in self-defense

37:15.192 --> 37:17.946
after being struck with the axe.

37:18.655 --> 37:20.281
And durin' that violent struggle

37:21.074 --> 37:22.784
she snapped.

37:23.285 --> 37:27.372
Dr. Fason confirmed that Candy
was truthful in her account.

37:28.457 --> 37:31.834
He also found that the violence
triggered a childhood trauma,

37:32.335 --> 37:38.090
rendering Candy into a rage
that caused her to go outside herself.

37:38.674 --> 37:42.137
Candy's testimony was not contradicted,
not once, not by anyone.

37:42.596 --> 37:44.931
Nor was Dr. Fason's medical opinion.

37:44.931 --> 37:47.351
All the police investigators,
the medical examiner,

37:47.351 --> 37:52.104
the pathologist, none of them,
none could rule out self-defense.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.441
So, how can you?

37:55.441 --> 37:57.401
None could exclude that
it was Betty Gore

37:57.401 --> 38:00.906
who first came at Candy
with that axe.

38:00.906 --> 38:02.156
So, how can you?

38:03.032 --> 38:05.826
What they all did agree on,

38:05.826 --> 38:09.206
a tremendous struggle took place.

38:09.206 --> 38:11.667
And if this were a planned thing,

38:11.667 --> 38:14.753
it was maybe
the worst planned crime ever.

38:14.753 --> 38:18.423
Candy told people at the church
that she was headed

38:19.257 --> 38:20.717
to Betty Gore's house.

38:21.552 --> 38:22.803
Nor was there any motive.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.055
As both Allan Gore and Candy testified,

38:26.055 --> 38:29.308
my client would stand nothing to gain
from killing Betty.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.936
The affair would not have been resumed.

38:31.936 --> 38:34.438
Neither Candy nor Allan
had any interest.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.149
It was over.

38:39.444 --> 38:44.448
In Candy's mind,
when Betty Gore came at her

38:44.448 --> 38:47.119
and struck her with that axe,

38:48.494 --> 38:51.205
Betty was no longer human.

38:51.874 --> 38:55.085
She had turned into an animal
in search of prey

38:55.085 --> 38:57.504
and what ensued in that utility room

38:57.504 --> 38:59.798
was a violent death fight.

38:59.798 --> 39:02.008
Betty Gore was a much larger woman.

39:02.008 --> 39:05.094
Adrenaline had to take over Candy
in order to survive.

39:05.094 --> 39:10.474
Adrenaline did take over,
and human life was lost.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.560
When a person gets killed,

39:12.560 --> 39:16.063
it's natural to wanna
hold someone accountable.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.692
It's natural for you to wanna fix things.

39:19.692 --> 39:21.195
To make it right.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.487
It may even cause some of you
to wanna believe

39:23.487 --> 39:25.282
the police version of this.

39:25.282 --> 39:26.825
But I remind you,

39:26.825 --> 39:29.995
the police version itself
cannot rule out self-defense.

39:32.705 --> 39:33.999
John Steinbeck

39:35.042 --> 39:36.168
once wrote that,

39:36.793 --> 39:40.255
"There are those among us
who live in rooms of experience

39:40.255 --> 39:41.965
that you and I cannot enter."

39:42.632 --> 39:45.426
If you're worried about
whether or not Mrs. Montgomery

39:45.426 --> 39:46.928
has been punished in this case,

39:47.970 --> 39:49.096
don't.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.016
She lives in that room of experience.

39:53.977 --> 39:57.772
She lives in it and she's locked in it
and it now constitutes a cell.

39:59.149 --> 40:00.609
A jail cell.

40:02.694 --> 40:05.029
There won't be a day in the life
of Mrs. Montgomery

40:05.029 --> 40:08.033
where she'll ever put out of her mind
that she committed this act

40:08.992 --> 40:11.036
on June 13th, 1980.

40:12.912 --> 40:17.960
There has been an American tragedy
played out in this courtroom.

40:18.544 --> 40:21.505
But a conviction is not a proper solution

40:21.505 --> 40:24.091
to this particular tragedy.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.928
The state has not proved its case.

40:29.637 --> 40:32.015
Reasonable doubt exists.

40:35.393 --> 40:36.352
Good luck to you.

40:57.164 --> 40:59.458
Mr. Crowder hits the point

40:59.458 --> 41:01.670
that Mrs. Montgomery's testimony
was not refuted.

41:03.546 --> 41:06.549
The person to refute Candy
Montgomery's testimony isn't here.

41:07.216 --> 41:09.469
She's dead. Chopped to bits.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.264
See, that's the thing,
when two people are in a room,

41:12.264 --> 41:15.516
and one ends up murdered,
you only get a single version of events.

41:18.728 --> 41:19.729
Let's look at Candy Montgomery's.

41:20.771 --> 41:23.316
I suspect it quite helped her
that all the evidence

41:23.316 --> 41:26.485
was available to her before she formed
her irrefutable testimony.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.070
- Objection.
- Overruled.

41:28.070 --> 41:29.907
Sit down, Mr. Crowder.
He didn't interrupt you.

41:34.578 --> 41:38.414
Mr. Crowder argues
none of this makes sense.

41:40.124 --> 41:42.336
I won't ask you to make sense of it.

41:42.336 --> 41:44.295
I'll just ask you to look
at what happened.

41:45.171 --> 41:48.883
Candy Montgomery struck
Betty Gore 41 times with an axe.

41:49.593 --> 41:52.011
Murdering her, disfiguring her,

41:52.011 --> 41:54.306
breaking bones, severing arteries,

41:54.306 --> 41:56.641
obliterating her skull and face.

41:56.641 --> 41:59.310
That is not consistent with self-defense.

41:59.936 --> 42:02.648
Mr. Crowder had the temerity

42:03.981 --> 42:06.902
to say Betty Gore stopped being human.

42:08.236 --> 42:10.696
I ask you,
who stopped being human here?

42:12.115 --> 42:13.366
Who was the animal?

42:14.284 --> 42:15.451
He wants you to believe her.

42:16.203 --> 42:17.955
To find her testimony credible.

42:18.789 --> 42:20.457
Seriously?

42:20.457 --> 42:22.125
She's lied at every turn.

42:22.125 --> 42:25.294
To the police, to her friends,
to her own husband.

42:25.294 --> 42:27.004
It was only after she was caught

42:27.714 --> 42:29.590
cold with a thumbprint match

42:29.590 --> 42:32.218
that Candy Montgomery
decided to become truthful.

42:35.179 --> 42:36.598
Self-defense.

42:37.431 --> 42:39.517
That's a lie.

42:39.517 --> 42:42.813
Hitting an unconscious woman
over and over and over with an axe

42:42.813 --> 42:46.816
as she lay there in her blood,
that's not self-defense.

42:50.403 --> 42:55.116
Because Betty said "shh,"
just like my mother did when I was 4?

42:56.869 --> 42:58.412
It insults this court's intelligence.

42:58.412 --> 42:59.997
It insults yours.

42:59.997 --> 43:02.541
Candy Montgomery knew
she couldn't possibly explain

43:02.541 --> 43:03.916
her actions on June 13th,

43:03.916 --> 43:06.211
so she chose to deny them.

43:06.211 --> 43:07.587
She chose to lie.

43:07.587 --> 43:10.549
On June 14th, on the 15th, on June 16th,

43:10.549 --> 43:14.178
the 17th, the 18th,
she stuck to the same story.

43:14.178 --> 43:16.180
With the police,
her friends, her husband.

43:16.180 --> 43:18.973
She left Betty alive

43:18.973 --> 43:20.725
went to Target to get
a Father's Day card.

43:21.726 --> 43:24.729
Then, as the truth catches up to her,

43:26.272 --> 43:29.066
she pivots. Self-defense.

43:34.822 --> 43:36.741
As for 41 whacks.

43:48.086 --> 43:49.588
You deserve better.

43:51.632 --> 43:53.549
Betty Gore deserves better.

44:03.517 --> 44:05.561
Both lawyers were strong,
both made their points,

44:05.561 --> 44:07.647
and both were not above
playing to the emotion.

44:07.647 --> 44:10.025
This case stirred up such strong
and visceral feelings,

44:10.025 --> 44:11.651
and neither attorney
shied away from them.

44:14.403 --> 44:16.322
Hey, what do you think?

44:17.199 --> 44:18.325
It's closer than I'd like it to be.

44:19.785 --> 44:21.160
We just have to wait.

44:22.578 --> 44:26.041
Well, whatever happens,
I'm sure it'll all be for the best.

44:38.512 --> 44:41.430
- Sherry's keeping the kids?
- For now.

44:42.307 --> 44:43.516
Till there's a verdict.

44:49.648 --> 44:51.567
You know, my mom always said

44:52.358 --> 44:55.570
that there's no better comfort food
than Salisbury steak and macaroni.

44:59.782 --> 45:02.868
You talk to her recently?
Other than the, the dream?

45:03.662 --> 45:06.414
This mornin'. She sends her prayers.

45:07.582 --> 45:09.500
And her prayers usually take.

45:13.671 --> 45:15.591
She's not mad at you, you think?

45:16.550 --> 45:20.262
She can't be thrilled.
Especially after she reads that.

45:26.059 --> 45:28.520
No, I just told her to stay away
from the newspapers

45:28.520 --> 45:29.854
or anything like that.

45:32.481 --> 45:33.691
Right.

45:34.233 --> 45:36.110
Well, I just can't wait
for all this to be over

45:36.110 --> 45:39.780
and I can go back to having a normal life

45:39.780 --> 45:42.575
and go to the market
without people staring at me.

45:44.660 --> 45:48.373
Candy, I think no matter what happens,
this will never be over.

45:48.373 --> 45:49.749
Well, if they find me innocent.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.544
The jury can't find you innocent.

45:53.419 --> 45:55.881
They can only find you not guilty.

45:55.881 --> 45:58.716
And there's a difference.

46:00.092 --> 46:02.178
We have no chance at a normal
life here.

46:02.178 --> 46:04.430
We're going to have to leave McKinney.

46:09.228 --> 46:11.145
Let's just pray we get that chance.

46:14.107 --> 46:15.526
Well, I thought your testimony was good.

46:16.943 --> 46:18.153
Thank you.

46:19.528 --> 46:21.447
I don't know if I deserve you, Pat.

46:22.615 --> 46:23.741
But I'm sure lucky to have you.

46:27.411 --> 46:28.371
We're both lucky.

46:32.541 --> 46:34.294
I think I wanna go back
and wait it out with Don

46:34.294 --> 46:37.339
'cause I just am feeling
a little too anxious sittin' here.

46:37.339 --> 46:39.840
Yeah. Okay.

46:46.849 --> 46:48.766
Don! Don!

46:50.184 --> 46:51.394
They're back.

46:52.436 --> 46:53.564
The jury. They have a verdict.

46:55.022 --> 46:56.650
- Already?
- The judge just called.

46:56.650 --> 46:58.360
I've got the car ready to take us back.

46:59.610 --> 47:01.195
We'll meet you there.

47:32.311 --> 47:33.729
Gentlemen, comin' through.

47:43.030 --> 47:44.114
All rise!

47:54.332 --> 47:56.168
You may be seated,
ladies and gentlemen.

47:59.003 --> 48:02.382
I have some instructions
for the attorneys, the parties,

48:02.382 --> 48:04.383
the spectators.

48:05.177 --> 48:06.595
When I read the verdict into the record,

48:07.554 --> 48:09.931
I want no reaction from anyone
in this courtroom.

48:10.556 --> 48:14.561
Whatever that verdict might be,
no vocal reaction, no physical reaction.

48:15.686 --> 48:18.732
And now don't think I'm picking on y'all.
That's standard.

48:19.815 --> 48:20.776
Alright, bring the jury in.

48:32.037 --> 48:32.995
Be seated.

48:39.044 --> 48:41.921
Alright then, Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict, sir?

48:41.921 --> 48:42.964
Your Honor, we have.

49:02.901 --> 49:03.861
Will the defendant please rise?

49:10.617 --> 49:11.576
We, the jury,

49:15.246 --> 49:16.373
find the defendant not guilty.

49:18.791 --> 49:21.086
Each member of the jury
that concurs with this verdict,

49:21.086 --> 49:24.381
will you indicate it to me
by raising your right hand?

49:24.381 --> 49:27.091
The court will accept the verdict
and order it filed.

49:27.091 --> 49:28.259
This case is adjourned.

49:38.395 --> 49:41.147
Congratulations, Candy.

50:09.676 --> 50:11.845
How do you feel about this?
Were you shocked?

50:30.989 --> 50:33.449
What about our beds and stuff?

50:33.449 --> 50:37.829
Well, the movers will come for that.
We just take what we need for now.

50:37.829 --> 50:40.332
The movers will bring it
all the way to Georgia?

50:40.332 --> 50:42.333
Yep. That's why we call them movers.

50:55.763 --> 50:58.100
Why don't you guys go say goodbye
to Miss Sherry?

50:58.100 --> 50:59.768
- I forgot something.
- Hi, hey, bud.

50:59.768 --> 51:02.229
Hey, how you doing?

51:42.936 --> 51:44.812

- Okay.

52:17.346 --> 52:20.641
I would've called, but I was afraid
you might say don't come.

52:24.186 --> 52:25.646
Anyway.

52:25.646 --> 52:29.190

52:36.530 --> 52:39.826
So, I just wanted to come by
and say goodbye.

52:43.497 --> 52:46.332

- Also, Allan.

52:48.210 --> 52:49.628
I'm sorry.

For everything that happened.
I never meant...

You know, she was a--

53:07.061 --> 53:08.312
She was a good person.
