09:40.080 --> 09:41.163
- Got like four stars somewhere.
- I heard it got six stars,

09:41.289 --> 09:42.581
which is, like,
impossible.

of the perpetrator.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.098
He's holding a shotgun
and everything.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.891
Wai-wait, wait,

Why are we even...

we were the heroes
of the evening.

This is ridiculous.

If I'm watching television
alone, by myself,

Um, and a little bit of these.

- Nobody...

11:55.298 --> 11:56.757
I have to express myself
physically,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.009
and so a really
serious situation for me

11:59.135 --> 12:00.636
is watching a comedy
on a plane.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.221
- Oh, gosh.
- That is a problem.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.931
- Yes, I... I do feel
for your fellow passengers.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.976
- I was literally on a plane
watching Bridesmaids,

12:08.103 --> 12:09.436
and you remember the scene where
she's got on the wedding dress,

12:09.562 --> 12:10.604
and she poops in the middle
of the street?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.231
- Yeah.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.440
- That scene comes on, and this
is what literally happens to me.

I went,

12:14.734 --> 12:18.404
"Oh, no. Oh, no.

In Montgomery, Alabama.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.685
I swear, the sun is so hot,
I nearly melted.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.895
- Indeed, Dr. King,
but I suspect

12:52.021 --> 12:53.647
we didn't meet here
to talk about the weather.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.067
- Indeed,
brother Malcolm.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.695
Unless, of course,
we articulate

12:59.821 --> 13:02.906
that the sun
in this country

13:03.032 --> 13:06.076
shines brighter on some
than it does on others.

13:06.202 --> 13:10.664
- Mm.
- Yeah.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.209
- Yes, but when the sun
does shine on us,

13:14.335 --> 13:17.087
it is growing
the seeds of revolution.

13:17.213 --> 13:21.300
- Amen.
- That's what I'm talking about.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.596
- I see your point,
brother Malcolm,

13:25.722 --> 13:31.018
but do not those same seeds
need to be watered with love?

13:33.730 --> 13:38.150

of some discussion, Dr. King.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.781
- And I am all for discussion,
brother Malcolm.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.950
Unless, of course,
the words devolve

13:47.076 --> 13:49.745
into proclamations
of hate.

13:49.871 --> 13:53.165
- Yes.
- Right.

13:53.291 --> 13:57.753
- Well, is that not why we
are here today, Dr. King...

13:57.879 --> 14:00.130
to discuss?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.217
[Fly buzzes]

14:06.554 --> 14:08.263
- Yes, brother Malcolm.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.683
And I am confident
that as we discuss...

14:11.809 --> 14:12.893
- We are going to discuss it

14:13.019 --> 14:14.937
and discuss it

14:15.063 --> 14:19.858
until I say that

14:19.984 --> 14:24.154
our people
have never resorted to violence

14:24.280 --> 14:27.241
before the white man
gave them no choice

14:27.367 --> 14:28.617
but to pay him back

14:28.743 --> 14:30.953
in the only currency
he understands.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.287
- Yes.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.088
is that what you
really have to say...

14:41.214 --> 14:43.799
at this point...
in our lunch?

14:43.925 --> 14:46.343
- Indeed, Dr. King,

14:46.469 --> 14:50.222
because we didn't land
on Plymouth Rock,

14:50.348 --> 14:52.599

landed on us.

All right.

Yeah, I-I've heard
you say that before.

15:03.444 --> 15:07.197

we're talking about rocks when,

15:07.323 --> 15:10.075
in fact,
it is the flesh and the bone

15:10.201 --> 15:12.744
and the... the dreams...
I-I have a dream

15:12.870 --> 15:15.622
that someday our children
will be judged

15:15.748 --> 15:17.499
by the content
of their character,

15:17.625 --> 15:19.835
not by the color
of their skin.

[Laughs] That's a given.

You know? I mean,
but in order to get there,

isn't he going to need
the help

we grew up in the '90s.

- Uh, and if you don't know,

was so high, it was like,

"What are you, a toreador?"
- Mm-hmm.

- And they had these pockets
that had these pleats on them,

16:52.637 --> 16:55.013
which gave the illusion of hips
on a man.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.640
