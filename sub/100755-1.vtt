WEBVTT

00:35.753 --> 00:37.485
I's a beautiful
sunny afternoon

00:37.487 --> 00:39.088
here in the Cowboy state.

00:39.090 --> 00:42.490
We've got partly cloudy skies
clearing by sundown

00:42.492 --> 00:44.726
and for you stargazers tonight,

00:44.728 --> 00:47.328
the Geminid meteor shower
is set to put on

00:47.330 --> 00:51.167
a once-in-a-lifetime show
between 6:00 pm and 2:00 am.

00:51.169 --> 00:54.937
So set your sights to the
North-Northeast high in the sky.

00:54.939 --> 00:56.671
The National Weather
Service says temps

00:56.673 --> 00:58.406
could dip into the mid-60s,

00:58.408 --> 01:01.476
so you have a beautiful night
to sit out with a sweetheart,

01:01.478 --> 01:04.113
kick back, and put
something on the grill.

01:04.114 --> 01:07.482
And her's a fun fact from
Wyoming's Meteor Research Center

01:07.484 --> 01:09.384
at Hopkin's Air Force base:

01:09.386 --> 01:11.821
only twice in
the showe's history

01:11.823 --> 01:15.157
have we seen a shower lasting
longer than two hours,

01:15.159 --> 01:18.359
and this one goes late,
late into the night,

01:18.361 --> 01:20.662
so it sounds like i's
going to be quite a show.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.397
Don't go to bed early!

01:22.399 --> 01:24.767
And I did't know this, but our
weather guy is saying to me

01:24.769 --> 01:27.069
that these falling stars
are actually debris from

01:27.071 --> 01:29.437
an asteroid that orbits the sun
every year-and-a half...

01:29.439 --> 01:32.607
I's named... how do you
pronounce this?

01:32.609 --> 01:35.277
"Fay-eh-thoon?"
Phaethon, is that it?

01:35.279 --> 01:36.779
Sounds close enough.

01:36.781 --> 01:38.848
So, we wo't be able
to see that tonight but

01:38.850 --> 01:41.917
plenty of shooting stars will
be dancing across the sky.

01:41.919 --> 01:45.620
Keep it cool, keep it fun,
keep it safe.

01:45.622 --> 01:47.890
Definitely be ready
for a fireworks display

01:47.892 --> 01:51.693
from Mother Nature to go
with your rock n roll.

01:51.695 --> 01:57.266
Currently 68 degrees and a
jam-packed line-up at KYOS...

02:36.207 --> 02:38.740
What began as excitement
has turned to concern

02:38.742 --> 02:40.809
in rural Wyoming this morning.

02:40.811 --> 02:42.677
Reports have been flooding
in from NORAD

02:42.679 --> 02:44.213
and the International
Space Station

02:44.215 --> 02:47.682
of some unusual activity
related to a meteor shower

02:47.684 --> 02:50.786
mostly-viewable
in the Northern U .S.

02:50.788 --> 02:53.923
Observatories around the
world are coordinating efforts

02:53.925 --> 02:57.293
to assure the meteor that
made ground late yesterday

02:57.295 --> 02:59.594
was one isolated incident.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.997
Mount Wilson Observatory
in Southern California

03:01.999 --> 03:05.167
is closely monitoring
a group of 58 meteors.

03:05.169 --> 03:08.304
They want to reassure the public
that there is at this point

03:08.306 --> 03:11.572
no cause for alarm and that
they are keeping a close eye

03:11.574 --> 03:14.542
- on the shower as it intensifies.
- Notches road, Notches road.

03:14.544 --> 03:16.111
Let me know when you see it.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.246
Stand by for more
breaking news and reports

03:17.248 --> 03:18.479
here on KYOS Wyoming.

03:18.481 --> 03:21.183
Next dirt road on the right.

03:21.185 --> 03:23.953
Why do meteors always land
in the middle of nowhere?

03:23.955 --> 03:26.057
I hate those country roads.

03:27.325 --> 03:28.960
I think we are here.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.832
100 years, 'm like,

03:36.834 --> 03:38.867
my great-grandfather
built that barn, you know?

03:38.869 --> 03:40.972
I's all I have.
I's all the money I have.

03:54.185 --> 03:56.686
Let's see what
we got here, huh?

04:04.195 --> 04:05.997
Well, let's go say hi.

04:11.701 --> 04:13.235
How you doing, guys?

04:13.237 --> 04:15.337
Hello. Hi, hi.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.471
Officer Pritchard.

04:16.474 --> 04:18.706
- Nice to meet you.
- Kurt.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.108
Yeah, at first I thought
it was a jet

04:20.111 --> 04:22.043
from the Air Force Base
that caught on fire

04:22.046 --> 04:23.912
or maybe it was a missile
that flew out of control.

04:23.914 --> 04:26.215
But until we got your call
to shelter in place,

04:26.217 --> 04:27.615
this town was in a panic.

04:27.617 --> 04:29.118
Yeah, well,
tha's understandable.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.153
A meteor traveling
10 times the speed of sound

04:31.155 --> 04:32.990
will frighten anybody.

04:35.592 --> 04:38.559
So are you the poor woman that
just got her house destroyed?

04:38.561 --> 04:40.029
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah.

04:40.031 --> 04:41.596
She was pretty shook up,
but she keeps mentioning

04:41.598 --> 04:43.531
how happy she is
that you guys are located

04:43.533 --> 04:45.234
just a couple miles up the road.

04:45.236 --> 04:48.037
Yeah, are you the folks
that study the, uh, UFOs?

04:48.039 --> 04:51.073
Uh, no.
We actually study meteors.

04:51.075 --> 04:53.008
Meredith, this
is Dr. Kurt Siegel.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.710
H's from the base.
H's their lead meteorologist.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.047
Tha's for weather, Brian.

04:58.049 --> 05:00.015
Actually, w're
called meteorists.

05:00.017 --> 05:01.850
Those weather people
claimed that cool name,

05:01.852 --> 05:04.286
unfortunately,
so here we are.

05:04.288 --> 05:06.789
Oh, yeah.
I mean, this was my house.

05:06.791 --> 05:08.157
I just put
in fresh juniper bushes.

05:08.159 --> 05:11.060
That explosion
even fried my radio.

05:11.062 --> 05:13.829
So do you mind
if we go ahead

05:13.831 --> 05:15.431
and take a closer
look at things?

05:15.433 --> 05:17.301
Yeah, feel free.
I's a sad sight. Come on.

05:21.539 --> 05:24.907
All right, this way.
Watch your step.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.341
Just got to go around here.

05:26.343 --> 05:29.346
There's too much damage
on the other side.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.315
All right now.
Watch your step here.

05:33.317 --> 05:34.316
I's kinda tricky.

05:34.318 --> 05:35.519
- Here.
- Okay.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.223
All right.
So it came from right over here

05:41.225 --> 05:44.428
and crashed the top of my house
and landed right over there.

05:48.799 --> 05:50.134
Go ahead.

05:53.537 --> 05:55.039
Here, watch yourself.
Watch it.

05:56.841 --> 05:58.442
All right.
Watch your step.

06:01.644 --> 06:03.314
Watch yourself.

06:08.385 --> 06:10.287
Look at that.

06:11.856 --> 06:14.423
Well, this does't make sense.

06:14.425 --> 06:16.391
What?

06:16.393 --> 06:19.194
The size of it.
I's way too big.

06:19.196 --> 06:21.465
Why?
What did you expect?

06:22.399 --> 06:24.068
About a fraction of this.

06:25.668 --> 06:27.304
Tha's about six foot.

06:31.408 --> 06:32.841
What do you think, Mara?

06:32.843 --> 06:35.743
If this was the size
of an actual missile,

06:35.745 --> 06:38.413
what would it do?

06:38.415 --> 06:39.982
Well, Geminids travel what?

06:39.984 --> 06:41.583
20,000 or 30,000 miles an hour?

06:41.585 --> 06:43.187
Tha's right.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.890
Okay.

06:47.892 --> 06:50.559
Well, even without a payload,
a small ICBM

06:50.561 --> 06:54.997
would generate the force
equivalent to a ton of TNT.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.001
I mean, this size...

06:59.069 --> 07:01.038
Speed?

07:04.542 --> 07:06.177
This whole town should be gone.

07:10.114 --> 07:11.480
Shit.

07:11.482 --> 07:13.415
How do you explain that, doc?

07:13.417 --> 07:16.285
I'm not sure.
The only plausible explanation

07:16.287 --> 07:17.886
is that this meteor
was traveling

07:17.888 --> 07:20.189
at a much slower speed than
it should have.

07:20.191 --> 07:21.957
W'll need a second opinion
on this.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.028
I gotta make a call.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.967
Hey, Gwen, it's Siegel.

07:31.969 --> 07:33.569
Yes, 'm at that crash site.

07:33.571 --> 07:36.138
There are a few things
that just don't add up here.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.375
I think we could really
use your expertise.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.145
Oh, you're on your way?
Good.

07:42.813 --> 07:44.913
Because I need you and Beth
down here STAT

07:44.915 --> 07:47.117
to run some element profiles.

07:49.153 --> 07:50.519
I can't figure out
for the life of me

07:50.521 --> 07:52.556
how this thing survived
the atmosphere...

07:56.961 --> 07:58.295
or if there will be more.

07:59.830 --> 08:01.597
W're gonna need to dig
into this thing.

08:01.599 --> 08:03.966
I hope you have
your field kit.

08:03.968 --> 08:06.702
Okay, see you in a minute.

08:06.704 --> 08:08.937
She asked if we could take
the helicopter to save time.

08:08.939 --> 08:10.172
And I told her
w're not breaking

08:10.174 --> 08:12.074
transport protocol ever again.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.675
Please do't tell me
you taught her

08:13.677 --> 08:15.312
how to fly a helicopter.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.348
I had a heart attack
when I found out

08:19.350 --> 08:21.416
you taught her
how to fly a jet.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.952
Boy, I wish I had
a chauffer to fly me around

08:23.954 --> 08:25.187
in a helicopter.

08:25.189 --> 08:27.923
Title's Heavy Weapons Analyst.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.858
But, yeah, I can
get people where they need to go

08:29.860 --> 08:31.262
from time to time.

08:33.163 --> 08:35.297
Especially if they wanna
blow stuff up.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.234
My apologies.

08:38.568 --> 08:42.169
To be fair, I did teach Gwen
the basics of flying an F-35.

08:42.172 --> 08:44.106
And I told her
the next time w're up,

08:44.107 --> 08:46.110
she can take the controls.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.111
So is Michael coming with her?

08:49.113 --> 08:50.812
Michael? No.

08:50.814 --> 08:52.314
I's just her and Beth.

08:52.316 --> 08:54.118
- The're here.
- Yeah.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.028
Gwen, I understand
your husban's

09:06.030 --> 09:07.829
a hot shot colonel
now at the base.

09:07.831 --> 09:10.666
But we do still need you in
the field from time to time.

09:10.668 --> 09:12.834
Sorry I'm late.
Beth is with us today.

09:12.836 --> 09:14.336
Beth, good to see you.

09:14.338 --> 09:15.971
Yeah. So, no, I'm late
because I had to start

09:15.973 --> 09:17.372
the spectral imaging process.

09:17.374 --> 09:19.141
I told you that
was unnecessary, Gwen.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.810
My predictive models call
this a meteor shower.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.912
Yeah, well, we should
talk about that.

09:23.914 --> 09:25.213
Yeah, we should.

09:25.215 --> 09:27.418
- You gotta take a look at this.
- Okay.

09:33.190 --> 09:34.823
Kurt, did you happen
to see all those dead birds

09:34.825 --> 09:36.458
in the drive in this morning?

09:36.460 --> 09:39.094
Yeah. Tha's not uncommon
in a meteor shower.

09:39.096 --> 09:42.998
Yeah, no,
but it seemed different.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.436
Gwen, what is it?

09:47.237 --> 09:49.304
Beth, would you mind
giving us a moment?

09:49.306 --> 09:51.108
Thanks.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.942
Kurt, I'm telling you,
I'm concerned

09:53.944 --> 09:55.477
about this meteor
cloud's density.

09:55.479 --> 09:57.946
If four objects aggregated
from the center,

09:57.948 --> 10:00.015
it could indicate
something much larger,

10:00.017 --> 10:01.683
more dangerous that's
affecting them.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.685
Gwen, I understand
you're being cautious

10:03.687 --> 10:06.021
because of Russia but I ran
a complete threat matrix

10:06.023 --> 10:07.759
and everything looked fine.

10:10.094 --> 10:12.060
Yeah, but what
if we were wrong about

10:12.062 --> 10:14.229
Phaeton's disappearance
in that solar storm?

10:14.231 --> 10:16.231
After that asteroid's
last perihelion,

10:16.233 --> 10:18.367
it never came back out
from behind the sun.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.704
That was the biggest solar
shower in decades.

10:22.774 --> 10:24.106
Unless we just ca't see it.

10:24.108 --> 10:28.078
Can't see it.
Gwen, no.

10:39.223 --> 10:41.592
Gwen, come on.
The crate's this way.

10:44.863 --> 10:46.563
Beth?

10:58.308 --> 11:00.475
So, Gwen, Beth,
this is Brian

11:00.477 --> 11:03.447
and next to him is Meredith,
the unfortunate home owner.

11:05.949 --> 11:08.851
Hey, Brian, Meredith, this
is our lead astrophysicist.

11:08.853 --> 11:10.352
Oh, my God!
Gwen Armstrong!

11:10.354 --> 11:12.721
I read all about you
in Wired Magazine.

11:12.723 --> 11:14.656
Looks like you have a fan.

11:14.658 --> 11:16.458
Oh, God, 'm so sorry
about what happened to those

11:16.460 --> 11:18.627
poor people who got injured
in Chelyabinsk, Russia.

11:18.629 --> 11:20.328
Thank you.

11:20.330 --> 11:23.198
I've read every single
one of your books. Seriously.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.633
When I saw it happen on
TV after your prediction,

11:24.635 --> 11:26.301
I felt so sad, you know?

11:26.303 --> 11:27.936
And it said that the U.S.
got the coordinates

11:27.938 --> 11:29.538
completely wrong.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.773
And by the time they warned the
Russians, it was just too late.

11:30.775 --> 11:32.474
Was that you?

11:32.476 --> 11:34.943
Were you the one who got the
coordinates completely wrong?

11:34.945 --> 11:37.481
That was me.

11:41.351 --> 11:44.221
I'm sorry.
Sorry that it happened.

11:45.522 --> 11:46.823
Thank you.

11:46.825 --> 11:48.358
Thank you for your kind words.

11:50.227 --> 11:52.194
Hey, Brian, Meredith?

11:52.196 --> 11:54.129
Can I borrow you guys
for a second?

11:54.131 --> 11:55.464
I want you to tell me all
about what you saw

11:55.466 --> 11:57.532
when that meteor struck, yeah?

11:57.534 --> 11:59.334
Hey, Mara, why do't
you go radio base

11:59.336 --> 12:00.803
and tell them w'll be here
about another hour?

12:00.805 --> 12:02.673
Copy that.

12:09.079 --> 12:10.547
You okay?

12:11.816 --> 12:13.381
Yeah.

12:13.383 --> 12:15.319
I just want to get this sample.

12:19.389 --> 12:22.324
But if 'm being
completely honest...

12:22.326 --> 12:24.896
this whole Russia thing
is still haunting me.

12:26.965 --> 12:28.430
Sorry.

12:28.432 --> 12:30.198
I don't mean to dump
all of this on you.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.970
I know yo're here
just to learn.

12:34.738 --> 12:37.506
Uh... Dr. Armstrong?

12:37.508 --> 12:38.707
Mm-hm?

12:38.709 --> 12:40.342
I don't mean
to overstep my bounds.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.777
But for what it's worth,

12:41.779 --> 12:45.080
your theories are taught
all over the world.

12:45.082 --> 12:47.182
Your husband, Michael,
just got promoted

12:47.184 --> 12:50.185
for helping redesign
a nuclear launch system

12:50.187 --> 12:52.087
and you get to work
with him every day.

12:52.089 --> 12:55.590
If I even had a fraction
of those things,

12:55.592 --> 12:58.059
I'd think my life
was pretty incredible.

12:58.061 --> 13:02.597
Thank you, for all of that.

13:02.599 --> 13:05.736
Okay, i's time to focus
on the task at hand, huh?

13:06.938 --> 13:09.538
All right.

13:09.540 --> 13:14.543
So I need you to put these on.

13:14.545 --> 13:18.480
I want you to monitor the meteor
cloud as I take the sample.

13:18.482 --> 13:21.383
I've never done this before.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.285
You said you want to work
in this industry, right?

13:23.287 --> 13:24.820
Absolutely.

13:24.822 --> 13:26.321
Well, right now we need
to make sure that

13:26.323 --> 13:29.090
this meteor shower
isn't a meteor storm

13:29.092 --> 13:31.395
or something more dangerous.

13:32.396 --> 13:35.265
Okay, put these on.

13:36.935 --> 13:38.002
I'll walk you through it.

13:39.503 --> 13:42.504
Okay, so the first setting
is just your basic telescope

13:42.506 --> 13:44.474
that you look
through the lens.

13:47.711 --> 13:50.412
The second rendering
closes the aperture

13:50.414 --> 13:52.247
and gives you a
real VR rendering

13:52.249 --> 13:55.283
from the Pentagon's database
in real time.

13:55.285 --> 13:57.487
Here you go.
Try that on.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.591
Oh, wow!
This is incredible!

14:02.593 --> 14:04.961
I's like 'm standing
above earth's orbit.

14:04.963 --> 14:06.996
Yeah. Pretty cool.

14:06.998 --> 14:08.764
And the third setting
just freezes the frame

14:08.766 --> 14:10.599
and gives you
an interactive model.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.902
But you don't need to worry
about that right now.

14:12.904 --> 14:14.904
What I need from you is
to tell me if you see

14:14.906 --> 14:17.372
meteor dust in the center
of that meteor cloud or

14:17.374 --> 14:20.508
if it's something solid
like an object.

14:20.510 --> 14:24.346
Oh, it kind of just
looks like a blob,

14:24.348 --> 14:27.215
like it keeps shifting
and changing around.

14:27.217 --> 14:28.884
But I can't really focus on it.

14:28.886 --> 14:30.518
Okay.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.387
Well, reach out your hand

14:32.389 --> 14:35.457
and pull up the menu bar
on the right hand side.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.126
Squeeze your wrist
and open it up, okay?

14:38.128 --> 14:41.797
And what is the density in the
center of that meteor cloud?

14:41.799 --> 14:45.003
Um, six objects
per square mile.

14:55.545 --> 14:56.444
Six?

14:56.446 --> 14:58.049
Yes, it says six.

15:01.786 --> 15:03.385
Do you remember
how to do a process?

15:03.387 --> 15:04.787
Yeah, I can do that.

15:04.789 --> 15:06.490
Okay, okay.

15:09.593 --> 15:12.130
Okay.
There you go.

15:17.701 --> 15:20.168
Hey, Gwen?
Wha's the ETA on that sample?

15:20.170 --> 15:23.571
Uh, 30 seconds.

15:23.573 --> 15:25.440
Okay.

15:25.442 --> 15:28.209
I don't understand why
he keeps rushing you.

15:28.211 --> 15:30.245
Maybe if he'd given
you more time on

15:30.247 --> 15:31.847
your spectral imaging
theory in Russia,

15:31.849 --> 15:33.851
all of those people would't
have gotten hurt.

15:35.352 --> 15:39.721
No. I had enough time.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.824
But your spectral
imaging theory revolutionized

15:41.826 --> 15:44.695
the way we do things
in the industry. I mean...

15:46.831 --> 15:48.530
Do you remember
that asteroid

15:48.532 --> 15:51.366
that we found off
the observatory in Hawaii?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.069
Yeah, it was 40,000 miles
off of earth.

15:53.071 --> 15:54.669
Mm-hm.

15:54.671 --> 15:57.807
Well, we found it
because of Kurt's algorithms.

15:57.809 --> 16:00.178
H's the best
at projecting algorithms.

16:01.311 --> 16:03.012
Wha's that process say?

16:03.014 --> 16:04.980
59% iron and 31% silicates.

16:04.982 --> 16:07.716
Both iron and silicates
are fully crystallized.

16:07.718 --> 16:11.586
But if Dr. Siegel
ran his algorithm tests

16:11.588 --> 16:14.489
on something better,
something worthwhile

16:14.491 --> 16:16.826
like the Braeburg Effect?

16:16.828 --> 16:18.861
I don't think that
Anton Braeburg is someone

16:18.863 --> 16:21.362
that you should want to
model your career after.

16:21.364 --> 16:24.769
H's kind of a laughing stock of
the science community right now.

16:25.970 --> 16:28.470
Okay.

16:28.472 --> 16:31.075
Hey, what's the core
temperature?

16:35.780 --> 16:37.113
400 degrees.

16:37.115 --> 16:38.480
Are you sure?

16:38.482 --> 16:40.852
Yeah, it says 400.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.258
Um, okay.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.527
W've got to take
another sample.

16:52.529 --> 16:53.998
That ca't be right.

17:21.491 --> 17:23.590
Hey, Gwen, how we coming
on that sample?

17:23.593 --> 17:25.797
Uh, 30 seconds.

17:35.940 --> 17:37.472
What is that, Gwen?

17:37.474 --> 17:39.175
I's a composite drill,.

17:39.177 --> 17:40.542
I's a a combination of a
diamond and a laser.

17:40.544 --> 17:42.579
It can cut through anything.

17:58.296 --> 18:00.664
W've got to get this back
to base immediately.

18:07.205 --> 18:08.436
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:08.438 --> 18:09.907
Hey, guys!

18:11.075 --> 18:13.142
A.M.S. site just
reported meteor made ground fall

18:13.144 --> 18:15.710
12 miles due south.
We gotta go. Come on.

18:15.712 --> 18:17.679
We have to get to base now!

18:17.681 --> 18:19.181
This is much worse
than we thought.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.952
I'll check in with NWS.

19:23.214 --> 19:24.914
No!

19:24.916 --> 19:26.851
Oh, no!

19:28.786 --> 19:30.319
- You okay?
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

19:30.321 --> 19:33.421
Just get us out of here! Go!
Get us out of here.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.259
Where's Gwen?
Where's Gwen?

19:38.930 --> 19:40.630
Gwen!

19:44.835 --> 19:46.270
Gwen!

19:47.805 --> 19:49.106
Come on!

20:26.944 --> 20:28.712
Kurt!

20:37.788 --> 20:39.021
Where did you get this car?

20:39.023 --> 20:40.422
Owner got killed
by a meteorite.

20:40.424 --> 20:42.159
Go, go, go!

20:45.528 --> 20:48.032
No!
Oh, no.

20:48.698 --> 20:50.935
Beth is back there.

21:06.649 --> 21:08.083
No, Beth!
Beth is back there!

21:08.085 --> 21:09.485
- We gotta go back!
- Beth is gone, Gwen!

21:09.487 --> 21:11.086
Gwen, Beth is gone.
Leave her!

21:11.088 --> 21:12.490
Damn it.

21:17.228 --> 21:19.795
There's no signal.
There's no signal anywhere!

21:19.797 --> 21:21.163
Mara, what do you got?
What do you know?

21:21.165 --> 21:23.298
Last update I got
was one minute ago.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.234
Meteor strike outside of Dublin.

21:25.236 --> 21:26.402
This thin's global.

21:26.404 --> 21:28.239
Oh, my God.

21:32.943 --> 21:34.709
Do you have anything?

21:34.711 --> 21:36.313
No, the network's jammed.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.152
You know what?
Let me try the satellite radio.

21:47.258 --> 21:48.791
Oh, my God!
Reverse! Reverse!

21:48.793 --> 21:50.394
- Go back!
- Go, go, go!

21:54.697 --> 21:56.934
Go!
Good, good, good.

21:58.668 --> 22:00.171
Mara!

22:10.548 --> 22:12.613
Okay, that was close.

22:12.615 --> 22:14.682
Everybody take a breath.
W're okay.

22:14.684 --> 22:16.087
We made it.

22:16.954 --> 22:19.290
- Okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

22:51.589 --> 22:53.755
Guys, if the ground fall
spans the entire hemisphere,

22:53.757 --> 22:58.293
there's no way the Pentagon got
off a full response, no way.

22:58.295 --> 22:59.862
You know, the're
definitely gonna add

22:59.864 --> 23:01.430
a Level Five nuke strike
for good measure.

23:01.432 --> 23:02.998
Probably.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.299
Well, if they've
already launched Level Five,

23:04.301 --> 23:05.868
then we're too late.

23:05.870 --> 23:07.336
Because those meteors
will detonate those nukes

23:07.338 --> 23:09.037
long before i'll reach
the asteroid.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.806
Then we'll have nothing
left to destroy it.

23:10.808 --> 23:12.908
What about NASA, JPL, GSS?

23:12.910 --> 23:13.976
The've had to have
seen something!

23:13.978 --> 23:15.577
No one can see it.

23:15.579 --> 23:17.579
I's hidden inside
the meteor cloud. Remember?

23:17.581 --> 23:18.981
I's the needle in a haystack.

23:18.983 --> 23:20.382
- I know.
- Hey, we just need to get there

23:20.384 --> 23:22.484
and we need to tell them
to stop a Level Five.

23:22.486 --> 23:24.853
Stop a Level Five?
The're not gonna react to us.

23:24.855 --> 23:27.156
The're gonna think we're giving
flawed data because of Russia!

23:27.158 --> 23:29.326
And if we need proof,
we do't have it.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.600
So what are we gonna do?

23:38.602 --> 23:39.902
I don't know, Mara.

23:39.904 --> 23:41.470
This contradicts
my entire threat matrix.

23:41.472 --> 23:42.504
I'm at a loss.

23:42.506 --> 23:43.805
Gwen, help me out!

23:43.807 --> 23:45.440
Okay. First things
first, okay?

23:45.442 --> 23:47.509
We have to make sure that
they launch the EMOD, okay.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.044
The evacuations, meteor shield,

23:49.046 --> 23:51.013
the ordinance and
the orbital drones, okay?

23:51.015 --> 23:52.114
And then, Kurt, you know what?

23:52.116 --> 23:53.649
I want you to take that this.

23:53.651 --> 23:55.450
Flag the center of the mass
in the meteor cloud.

23:55.452 --> 23:58.220
Mark it as an APB and
let all the departments know.

23:58.222 --> 23:59.687
At least that'll give
them a fighting chance

23:59.689 --> 24:00.688
at least of IDing it.

24:00.690 --> 24:01.790
I got it. Got it.

24:01.792 --> 24:03.025
Okay? Good.

24:03.027 --> 24:04.461
Okay, keep driving.

24:25.015 --> 24:26.348
And Level Five?

24:26.350 --> 24:28.317
As far as Level Five,
Kur's right.

24:28.319 --> 24:30.252
The're not gonna delay
a threat response.

24:30.254 --> 24:32.221
And if we want them
to stop the launch then,

24:32.223 --> 24:34.489
the data needs
to come from somebody else,

24:34.491 --> 24:36.060
someone like Michael.

24:37.795 --> 24:39.328
H's now Lieutenant Colonel

24:39.330 --> 24:41.530
and h's got
nuclear defense clearances.

24:41.532 --> 24:43.632
Yeah, but even if the order
comes down from him,

24:43.634 --> 24:46.868
he still has to get vetted
by Singh wh's at base.

24:46.870 --> 24:48.604
Yeah, and Singh's not stupid.

24:48.606 --> 24:50.539
H's gonna know that order
is coming from you, Gwen.

24:50.541 --> 24:52.307
Not if he breaks
the chain of command

24:52.309 --> 24:54.443
and goes straight
to the Pentagon, okay?

24:54.445 --> 24:57.479
There's no vetting, there's no
agencies, there's no red tape.

24:57.481 --> 25:00.148
Michael still blames
me for Russia, Gwen.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.583
H's gonna think your
breaking protocol

25:01.585 --> 25:04.286
to save time for some
back intel I gave you.

25:04.288 --> 25:06.521
Look, we all know
whose fault Russia was.

25:06.523 --> 25:08.290
It wasn't yours.

25:08.292 --> 25:11.126
I love him, but today h's
just gonna have to get over it.

25:11.128 --> 25:15.030
Yeah, well, what if
Michael's unable to do it?

25:15.032 --> 25:16.832
Well, if he's unable to do
it, then you know what?

25:16.834 --> 25:18.133
I'm going to take
the spec rendering

25:18.135 --> 25:19.968
straight to the Colonel,

25:19.970 --> 25:21.236
straight to the
Command room right at base.

25:21.238 --> 25:22.371
Right.

25:22.373 --> 25:24.139
We have to stop
this launch, okay?

25:24.141 --> 25:25.874
So just get us to the base
and I'll get the proof.

25:25.876 --> 25:27.109
Yes, ma'am.

25:27.111 --> 25:29.113
W'll get you there.

25:47.131 --> 25:48.797
- Michael?
- Gwen?

25:48.799 --> 25:50.666
There's a two-mile
wide asteroid hidden inside

25:50.668 --> 25:52.134
this meteor storm.

25:52.136 --> 25:53.669
W've got approximately
two hours and 29 minutes

25:53.671 --> 25:55.370
until it hits.

25:55.372 --> 25:57.439
Any nuclear response needs to
be saved to strike the asteroid.

25:57.441 --> 25:59.441
Gwen, you know
I can't do that.

25:59.443 --> 26:02.077
Colonel Singh has to approve
any protocol changes.

26:02.079 --> 26:03.578
I mean, I can
flag incoming threats

26:03.580 --> 26:05.080
on the defense database system.

26:05.082 --> 26:07.182
But I need a commanding
officer to clear it.

26:07.184 --> 26:11.386
But none of the other agencies
can see the asteroid!

26:11.388 --> 26:13.555
Michael, this is the worst
case scenario.

26:13.557 --> 26:15.590
The only reason I know
i's there is because

26:15.592 --> 26:18.262
I was able to examine
this mornin's meteorite.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.066
What is that?

26:24.068 --> 26:26.001
Meteor debris.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.536
Shouldn't be that big.

26:27.538 --> 26:29.471
It is.

26:29.473 --> 26:32.007
Oh, my gosh!
I's creating a dust cloud.

26:32.009 --> 26:34.209
Keep going!
Keep driving!

26:34.211 --> 26:37.479
No, no, no, no, no!

26:37.481 --> 26:39.717
- Damn it!
- Oh, no.

26:42.653 --> 26:44.419
Oh, no.

26:44.421 --> 26:46.188
Are you okay?
Wha's going on?

26:46.190 --> 26:47.589
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

26:47.591 --> 26:49.124
I's just that our
vehicle stalled.

26:49.126 --> 26:51.326
Meteor debris
choked out the engine.

26:51.328 --> 26:53.295
Oh, no.

26:53.297 --> 26:54.229
Damn it!

26:54.231 --> 26:56.801
Well, let's go fix it.

27:11.648 --> 27:13.415
Okay...

27:13.417 --> 27:14.282
Okay, okay.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.220
What do you think it is?

27:19.390 --> 27:21.456
I's the belt chain.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.726
Belt chain.

27:24.995 --> 27:26.495
Okay.

27:26.497 --> 27:28.663
Gwen, you gotta get
out of there right now.

27:28.665 --> 27:30.232
This meteor storm is escalating!

27:30.234 --> 27:32.033
The DOD has already approved
a Level Five launch

27:32.035 --> 27:34.603
and there's gonna be a meteor
shower right in your area.

27:34.605 --> 27:35.704
Get out!

27:35.706 --> 27:37.406
Michael, listen to me.

27:37.408 --> 27:40.075
I can't stop this nuke strike,
but you can.

27:40.077 --> 27:41.410
Defense protocols
are cleared

27:41.412 --> 27:43.011
for rank Lieutenant Colonel
and above.

27:43.013 --> 27:45.247
Okay, call General Ambrose
at the Pentagon

27:45.249 --> 27:46.783
and tell him it was
you who personally

27:46.785 --> 27:48.550
identified this
as an asteroid.

27:48.552 --> 27:51.153
We have to save the nukes
for the asteroid!

27:51.155 --> 27:53.155
I'm not gonna lie
to a commanding officer!

27:53.157 --> 27:55.190
It is't a lie.

27:55.192 --> 27:56.558
I's a mass inside a cloud

27:56.560 --> 27:58.795
that you or anyone
can see easily on radar.

27:58.797 --> 28:01.430
It just has't been
IDed as an asteroid yet.

28:01.432 --> 28:02.931
The observatories
can't tell what it is

28:02.933 --> 28:05.202
and the DOD isn't
listening to me.

28:06.370 --> 28:08.336
Is this from some intel
that Mara gave you?

28:08.338 --> 28:12.209
No, Michael.
You can confirm it personally.

28:13.577 --> 28:15.177
I's as if you've captured
the dimensions

28:15.179 --> 28:17.078
through
spectral imaging, okay?

28:17.080 --> 28:20.449
You're asking me to stop a
nuclear strike in mid-launch?

28:20.451 --> 28:21.918
W're gonna leave
the whole planet

28:21.920 --> 28:23.385
vulnerable to
a meteor storm.

28:23.387 --> 28:25.053
If you launch that strike,

28:25.055 --> 28:26.388
this storm will detonate
every one of those nukes

28:26.390 --> 28:28.056
before it reaches the asteroid.

28:28.058 --> 28:30.525
Only use conventional weapons
on the meteors.

28:30.527 --> 28:32.929
The drones have plasma
cannons that can melt tanks.

28:32.931 --> 28:35.865
And the satellite missiles?
Well, the're bunker busters.

28:35.867 --> 28:39.534
And the meteor shield
is woven crystallized carbon.

28:39.536 --> 28:41.369
And if the nukes strike
in the upper atmosphere,

28:41.371 --> 28:43.505
w're talking fallout
on a global scale.

28:43.507 --> 28:45.140
At its current heading,
the nukes will strike it

28:45.142 --> 28:46.876
right outside the mesosphere.

28:46.878 --> 28:49.744
Fallout will be high enough just
like any other nuclear test.

28:49.746 --> 28:52.347
Gwen...

28:52.349 --> 28:55.319
I could go to prison
for the rest of my life.

28:56.821 --> 28:58.386
We both could.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.355
There's no time!
Break the chain of command!

29:00.357 --> 29:02.724
Okay?
You have to stop this launch!

29:02.726 --> 29:04.762
Michael, you have to believe me!

29:07.698 --> 29:09.164
Wha's our mark?

29:09.166 --> 29:12.033
Two hours, 16 minutes,
south-southwest.

29:12.035 --> 29:13.670
I love you.

29:14.705 --> 29:15.840
I love you.

29:22.145 --> 29:24.782
So yo're a mechanic.
Tha's nice.

29:41.799 --> 29:43.732
I got it.

29:43.734 --> 29:45.235
You got it.

29:47.839 --> 29:49.839
Right.

29:49.841 --> 29:51.375
Yeah, come on.

30:09.293 --> 30:12.427
This just in: the
Geological Society of America

30:12.429 --> 30:15.230
is now weighing in on
the growing threat of what

30:15.232 --> 30:19.167
is now being called a
"Meteor Storm".

30:19.169 --> 30:21.603
Reported gravitational anomalies
and impact zones

30:21.605 --> 30:24.040
are stirring up
geologic activity,

30:24.042 --> 30:28.577
including hot zones of volcanic
activity in our national parks.

30:28.579 --> 30:32.714
Carbon dioxide, monoxide and
methane levels in the atmosphere

30:32.716 --> 30:35.550
are spiking nationwide.

30:35.552 --> 30:38.353
This is beginning to impact
the wildlife in the area,

30:38.355 --> 30:40.355
with reported injuries
and deaths being seen

30:40.357 --> 30:42.624
as far north as Canada.

30:42.626 --> 30:45.861
The Department of Defense
is involved as well as the U.N.

30:45.863 --> 30:48.998
and NATO in preparation for
a potential nuclear strike

30:49.000 --> 30:50.498
on the meteor storm.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.367
Standby by for
further instructions

30:52.369 --> 30:54.636
from the Emergency
Broadcast System

30:54.638 --> 30:57.875
and in the meantime,
please remain indoors.

30:58.977 --> 31:00.442
Wyoming!

31:00.444 --> 31:03.278
I just received a terminate
signal from you!

31:03.280 --> 31:05.682
Hang on!
I'm putting you on com!

31:07.618 --> 31:10.452
There had better be a
good reason for this!

31:10.454 --> 31:13.321
Sir, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Michael Armstrong, sir.

31:13.323 --> 31:14.857
Under Colonel Singh in Wyoming.

31:14.859 --> 31:17.492
I have full confirmation
of an incoming NEO

31:17.494 --> 31:19.628
backed by radar GSS.

31:19.630 --> 31:22.364
Incoming coordinates outlined
by radar are as follows:

31:22.366 --> 31:25.667
tha's ID number 3200 Phaeton,

31:25.669 --> 31:27.669
vector southwest, sir.

31:27.671 --> 31:29.772
Sir, we need to stop Level Five
countdown immediately

31:29.774 --> 31:32.207
and retain as a defense
against the asteroid.

31:34.979 --> 31:36.711
We did not copy, Lieutenant!

31:36.713 --> 31:38.647
Repeat, we did not copy!

31:38.649 --> 31:41.383
I repeat!
We have an incoming NEO!

31:41.385 --> 31:43.485
It will strike in T-minus

31:43.487 --> 31:45.021
two hours, 16 minutes, sir!

31:45.023 --> 31:47.322
We are aware of the
meteor storm, Lieutenant.

31:47.324 --> 31:50.325
However, your alarm regards
a global response.

31:50.327 --> 31:53.628
Is this signed off
by Colonel Singh?

31:53.630 --> 31:55.131
Colonel Singh is
responding directly

31:55.133 --> 31:56.665
to a situation
in the field, sir.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.667
But I have direct orders
from the colonel

31:58.669 --> 32:00.468
to terminate Level Five, sir.

32:00.470 --> 32:04.272
Lieutenant, we have
all EMODs active!

32:04.274 --> 32:05.941
Terminate Level Five, sir.

32:05.943 --> 32:08.878
We are confirmed on
the meteor threat, Lieutenant!

32:08.880 --> 32:11.579
I re...
abort le... Five, sir!

32:11.581 --> 32:13.983
Level Five, abort!
Do you copy, General?

32:13.985 --> 32:15.519
We are initiat...

32:33.805 --> 32:36.839
Nice of you to join us,
Lieutenant Armstrong.

32:36.841 --> 32:38.573
Apologies, sir.
It wo't happen again.

32:38.575 --> 32:40.742
Daniels, what's the status
on the meteor shower?

32:40.744 --> 32:46.849
Incoming,
Vector 20, Delta 909, Kentucky.

32:46.851 --> 32:47.950
Incoming.

32:47.952 --> 32:52.387
Vector 919, Epsilon 30,
South Dakota.

32:52.389 --> 32:54.556
Washington confirms
drones are in place,

32:54.558 --> 32:57.392
meteor shield deployed,
orbital missiles engaged.

32:57.394 --> 33:01.931
Level Five Strike at
T minus three minutes.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.967
We have a terminate
switch active

33:04.969 --> 33:08.638
on our global response, sir.
Is this accurate?

33:13.077 --> 33:16.011
This phon's dead.
Get me Ambrose on the line.

33:16.013 --> 33:17.614
Yes, sir.

33:21.953 --> 33:24.654
This is gonna be a long
day, Daniels.

33:30.828 --> 33:33.361
Armstrong, what's the status
on that phone?

33:33.363 --> 33:34.729
IT is working on it, sir.

33:34.731 --> 33:36.801
We should be back up
in a few minutes.

33:38.702 --> 33:40.568
We are still on track
for launch.

33:40.570 --> 33:44.106
Nuclear response in T minus
2 minutes 30 seconds.

33:44.108 --> 33:46.374
Even if we ca't get in touch
with the Pentagon,

33:46.376 --> 33:47.943
we are following our last
known orders.

33:47.945 --> 33:50.982
Daniels, check the targeting
array is still aligned.

34:12.235 --> 34:13.534
Sir, we have a
full system crash

34:13.536 --> 34:15.670
in the western half of the U.S.!

34:15.672 --> 34:18.174
Colonel, we just severed
our apparatus to the Pentagon.

34:18.176 --> 34:21.576
Our missile systems for the
whole region are failing.

34:21.578 --> 34:23.578
Sir, what did you do?

34:23.580 --> 34:25.446
Lieutenant Armstrong,

34:25.447 --> 34:27.649
step away from the com
and disarm now!

34:27.650 --> 34:29.417
Private Daniels, get DOD
back online

34:29.418 --> 34:31.319
to initiate that
launch right now.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.687
Sir, all of our coms are down.

34:32.688 --> 34:34.889
Our landline and
backup feed are down.

34:34.891 --> 34:37.760
Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong
crashed the system, sir.

34:37.762 --> 34:40.228
Subdue him now!
Get the system back online!

34:40.231 --> 34:42.697
Daniels, get me communication
with the Pentagon now.

34:42.699 --> 34:44.099
I's our new
guidance system, sir!

34:44.101 --> 34:45.900
Armstrong cut off
half the country,

34:45.902 --> 34:47.937
and a meteor just struck our
bas's satellite dish, sir.

34:47.938 --> 34:50.371
Okay. Repair the dish and
run an auxiliary patch

34:50.373 --> 34:51.940
straight to our ground lines.

34:51.943 --> 34:53.876
You may have just killed
millions of people.

34:53.878 --> 34:56.245
Stick him in Holding
or 'll kill him myself.

34:56.246 --> 34:59.681
Colonel! I had no choice but
to cancel the Level Five!

34:59.683 --> 35:01.784
You just severed our
defenses to a global threat!

35:01.786 --> 35:05.287
I confirm when to call off a
nuclear strike!

35:05.289 --> 35:07.058
I will skin him alive for this!

35:15.900 --> 35:21.070
Sir, EMOD live
and engaging targets.

35:21.072 --> 35:23.471
All nuclear
capable countries have confirmed

35:23.473 --> 35:25.241
participation Level Five.

35:25.243 --> 35:26.978
Give me a Level Five mark.

35:38.823 --> 35:40.823
We are live.
Targe's engaged.

35:40.825 --> 35:43.424
Okay.
Give me a real time kill ratio.

35:43.426 --> 35:45.094
Keep me appraised Level Five.

35:45.096 --> 35:49.798
Standing by for kill ratio
and Level Five standing by.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.400
Have we restored communication
with the Pentagon?

35:52.402 --> 35:55.804
ETA, 30 seconds, sir.

35:55.806 --> 36:00.744
EMOD kill ration at 6%
and climbing. 7%. 8%.

36:06.918 --> 36:09.287
Gwen, check with VR,
see wha's happening.

36:19.931 --> 36:22.097
Did the meteor shield deploy?

36:22.099 --> 36:23.332
Mm-hmm.

36:23.334 --> 36:25.803
Looks like we still have
incoming meteors!

36:28.205 --> 36:32.174
Level Five launch
in T minus 30, 29,

36:32.176 --> 36:35.311
28, 27,

36:35.313 --> 36:37.281
26, 25...

36:43.821 --> 36:46.021
Gwen?

36:46.023 --> 36:47.790
The meteors are still
coming through.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.659
Wha's going on
out there?

36:51.796 --> 36:53.429
All batteries are deployed.

36:53.431 --> 36:55.866
Defense systems are firing
but tha's not enough.

37:11.681 --> 37:13.683
Oh, shoot.

37:16.020 --> 37:19.121
18, 17, 16...

37:19.123 --> 37:22.858
15, 14, 13, 12...

37:22.860 --> 37:23.993
Phalanx one through four down!

37:23.995 --> 37:25.828
Phalanx eight through 12 down!

37:25.830 --> 37:27.595
Launch orthogonal 90 degrees!

37:27.597 --> 37:29.298
Sir, nuclear assets
in the entire

37:29.300 --> 37:31.066
western hemisphere are offline.

37:31.068 --> 37:32.868
It seems like
the've been crashed

37:32.870 --> 37:34.336
from a program out of Wyoming.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.804
Do we have backup?

37:35.806 --> 37:37.842
Launch backup as soon
as it's live!

37:44.714 --> 37:46.982
Gwen, wha's
the status on that response?

37:46.984 --> 37:49.184
Only 12% of the meteors
have been destroyed.

37:49.186 --> 37:50.119
Twelve percent.

37:50.121 --> 37:52.054
Still no sign of
the nukes.

37:59.696 --> 38:02.331
East Coast backup system
is restored!

38:02.333 --> 38:04.800
T minus 0 and launch.

38:04.802 --> 38:06.470
East Coast is go.

38:11.541 --> 38:13.244
Russia is go!

38:20.583 --> 38:22.319
India is go!

38:29.726 --> 38:31.796
U.S. arsenal, 50%.

38:49.413 --> 38:50.345
No!

38:50.347 --> 38:51.679
No, no, no, no!

38:51.681 --> 38:53.282
What? What? What?
What is it?

38:53.284 --> 38:54.783
The nukes.

38:54.785 --> 38:56.919
The've detonated the nukes!

38:56.921 --> 38:58.653
I have VR confirmation
that they've launched

38:58.655 --> 39:02.359
from the East Coast along with
all the other nuclear countries!

39:03.127 --> 39:05.262
This is Dr. Armstrong.
Come in.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.666
Wha's our percentage of
airborne nuclear missiles?

39:11.668 --> 39:13.235
50%.

39:13.237 --> 39:14.870
All other countries have
launched their full arsenal.

39:14.872 --> 39:16.505
Orbital weapons?

39:16.507 --> 39:18.507
All ordinance and drones
are completely destroyed.

39:18.509 --> 39:21.577
W've also lost four out of 20
of our communication satellites.

39:21.579 --> 39:24.113
The only thing we have left
is the shield, sir.

39:27.051 --> 39:28.450
Yeah?

39:28.452 --> 39:30.185
Michael, why did you let
them launch the nukes?

39:30.187 --> 39:32.720
Dr. Armstrong, your husband
has been arrested

39:32.722 --> 39:34.423
for a breach of
national security.

39:34.425 --> 39:36.492
His attempt to take down
the nuclear guidance system

39:36.494 --> 39:39.361
was stopped but we were only
able to fire half our payload.

39:39.363 --> 39:41.163
Colonel, sir?

39:41.165 --> 39:42.865
I assure you that Michael was
just forwarding the message...

39:42.867 --> 39:45.033
If yo're involved in
any way in any of this,

39:45.035 --> 39:47.002
you will never see
light of day again.

39:47.004 --> 39:49.505
Now return to base immediately
and report to me in Command.

39:56.347 --> 39:58.847
Michael's been arrested
and Singh wants me to report

39:58.849 --> 40:00.082
to the Command Center
as soon as we arrive.

40:00.084 --> 40:01.649
But you can't report to Singh!

40:01.651 --> 40:03.252
If he has you arrested,
you're done!

40:03.254 --> 40:04.453
W're all done!

40:04.455 --> 40:05.854
Mar's absolutely right.

40:05.856 --> 40:07.623
I can run predictive
algorithms all day long.

40:07.625 --> 40:10.325
But spectral imaging, that is
your area of expertise, Gwen.

40:10.327 --> 40:13.862
By the time I compile the data,
it would be too late.

40:13.864 --> 40:15.397
Her's what we're gonna do.

40:15.399 --> 40:16.899
As soon as we arrive
at the security checkpoint,

40:16.901 --> 40:18.600
I want you to report
your injuries.

40:18.602 --> 40:20.068
Under Code Blue, they cannot
arrest any injured personnel.

40:20.070 --> 40:21.436
Right.

40:21.438 --> 40:22.703
The'll definitely have
MPs looking for you

40:22.705 --> 40:24.373
all over the medical bay.

40:24.375 --> 40:26.475
I imagine they will, but 'll
find my way to the lab, okay?

40:26.477 --> 40:28.277
I'll get the proof and 'll
meet Singh in Command Center.

40:28.279 --> 40:29.580
Got it.

40:32.249 --> 40:33.517
Defense alarm.

40:35.419 --> 40:36.852
Hey, what have we got?

40:36.854 --> 40:39.890
No!
No, no, no.

40:48.766 --> 40:50.265
The strike is complete, sir.

40:50.267 --> 40:51.934
All nuclear weapons
from all countries

40:51.936 --> 40:53.769
have detonated in orbit, sir.

40:53.771 --> 40:56.872
Wha's our kill percentage?

40:56.874 --> 40:58.106
25%, sir.

40:58.108 --> 40:59.740
What?
Tha's not possible!

41:05.349 --> 41:08.150
Meteor shield taking
heavy fire, sir!

41:08.152 --> 41:10.221
Sir, the entire shiel's
coming apart!

41:10.955 --> 41:12.423
Son of a bitch.

41:22.166 --> 41:24.032
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

41:24.034 --> 41:27.536
Let's go. Where is everybody?
Why are there no guards?

41:27.538 --> 41:29.171
I's protocol to secure
all personnel

41:29.173 --> 41:30.672
inside the facility
during a launch.

41:30.674 --> 41:33.310
Looks like the cameras
are down. Thanks, Michael.

41:34.945 --> 41:36.678
Code Blue!
Where's the OR?

41:36.680 --> 41:38.146
OR? Why?
What happened?

41:38.148 --> 41:39.448
Please!
I've lost a lot of blood!

41:39.450 --> 41:40.949
- How? What happened?
- I was hit by a meteor!

41:40.951 --> 41:42.317
Come on!
We do't have time!

41:42.319 --> 41:44.353
- Where do you need to go?
- OR!

41:44.355 --> 41:45.990
Come on.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.257
Code orange is now in effect.

41:48.259 --> 41:49.992
All medical personnel report

41:49.994 --> 41:52.696
to your designated
emergency response locations.

41:54.431 --> 41:55.964
I'm all right,
I'm all right.

41:55.966 --> 41:59.034
Oh, God, I should wrap this up.

41:59.036 --> 42:01.272
Yeah, I'm okay.

42:03.007 --> 42:04.339
Don't worry about me.

42:04.341 --> 42:07.044
- Give us a minute, please!
- Thank you.

42:09.079 --> 42:10.879
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just get the gauze.

42:10.881 --> 42:13.217
Wrap me up.
We gotta go.

42:17.554 --> 42:19.523
Just grab anything.

42:23.027 --> 42:24.393
Wha's wrong with you?

42:24.395 --> 42:26.328
- I'm fine.
- Mara, what happened?

42:26.330 --> 42:28.130
I'm fine.

42:28.132 --> 42:30.132
All right, come here.
You have to help me.

42:30.134 --> 42:32.202
- Hold on.
- All right.

42:38.842 --> 42:40.678
Are you sure yo're all right?

42:47.786 --> 42:49.486
Okay. Sit down.

42:51.522 --> 42:52.921
I'm sorry.

42:52.923 --> 42:54.890
I's all right.
Just a quick wrap.

42:54.892 --> 42:57.394
- We gotta go.
- I know.

43:02.266 --> 43:03.667
Mara, you sure
you're all right?

43:05.602 --> 43:07.436
I'm fine.

43:07.438 --> 43:10.207
Hey, thank you.

43:10.809 --> 43:12.274
Yeah.

43:12.276 --> 43:14.578
We have to go talk
to Colonel Singh.

43:18.649 --> 43:21.049
Are you okay?

43:21.051 --> 43:23.620
Yeah.
Let's go see Singh.

43:42.306 --> 43:45.642
Okay, all right.
Let's get you going.

43:47.544 --> 43:50.145
Pop up.

43:50.147 --> 43:52.116
Where's the screen here?

43:52.950 --> 43:54.516
There.

43:54.518 --> 43:56.218
All right, so...

43:56.220 --> 43:59.323
Tha's good.
And these coordinates.

44:00.491 --> 44:02.393
47...

44:05.429 --> 44:06.765
Nine...

44:10.601 --> 44:12.667
Okay.

44:12.669 --> 44:15.270
This database.

44:15.272 --> 44:18.275
Around the meteor cloud,
the density.

44:19.276 --> 44:20.744
600...

44:24.715 --> 44:26.250
Let's find you.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.627
Officer Pritchard.
Dr. Siegel.

44:38.629 --> 44:39.995
Colonel Singh, sir.

44:39.997 --> 44:42.364
As soon as the storm passes,

44:42.366 --> 44:45.802
we will be disbanding
your department.

44:45.804 --> 44:47.169
The incoming is so heavy,

44:47.171 --> 44:48.537
we can barely get damage
report from the field.

44:48.539 --> 44:50.238
Colonel, sir!

44:50.240 --> 44:51.706
Dr. Armstrong thought
the threat was big enough.

44:51.708 --> 44:53.275
She doesn't give orders!
I give orders!

44:53.277 --> 44:54.676
Where is Gwen Armstrong?

44:54.678 --> 44:57.012
Sir, she left us as soon
as we arrived.

44:57.014 --> 44:58.547
Well, she needs to be here
at this com

44:58.549 --> 45:00.449
to be questioned
by me personally!

45:00.451 --> 45:02.384
People are dead
and dying, Dr. Siegel!

45:02.386 --> 45:04.986
- Sir.
- Officer Pritchard?

45:04.988 --> 45:07.222
Sir, 've been working
the field with Dr. Armstrong

45:07.224 --> 45:08.891
for over seven years now

45:08.893 --> 45:10.860
and her input concerning
this storm

45:10.862 --> 45:13.361
is critical to our survival.

45:13.363 --> 45:14.696
Mm-hm.

45:14.698 --> 45:16.398
I'm aware of your work
with Dr. Armstrong.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.300
Her husband has't
been shy about reporting

45:18.302 --> 45:20.471
your failures in Russia.

45:26.143 --> 45:27.511
Here...

45:28.847 --> 45:30.547
There.

45:37.554 --> 45:38.957
There you are.

45:40.057 --> 45:41.592
There you are.

45:42.493 --> 45:46.461
Yep. I knew it!

45:46.463 --> 45:48.665
Okay, okay.

45:49.868 --> 45:51.201
Yep.

46:04.114 --> 46:05.781
You know what?

46:05.783 --> 46:08.383
Gwen Armstrong has been flagged
as a national security risk.

46:08.385 --> 46:10.418
And I cannot have her
wandering this base.

46:10.420 --> 46:11.921
Colonel, sir, you must
let her complete her testing

46:11.923 --> 46:14.523
- before you speak...
- Dr. Siegel, I respect you

46:14.525 --> 46:15.892
and I'm trying
to respect your team.

46:15.894 --> 46:17.359
But after the Russia incident

46:17.361 --> 46:18.928
and today's failed
orbit defense,

46:18.930 --> 46:21.596
you are no longer cleared
to advise this base.

46:21.598 --> 46:23.265
Are you with me?

46:27.839 --> 46:29.371
Where's the power reserve?

46:29.373 --> 46:31.540
The last impact carried
an electromagnet pulse!

46:31.542 --> 46:33.708
The reserve power's
offline, sir.

46:33.710 --> 46:35.510
Engineering's en route
right now to repair it.

46:35.512 --> 46:37.045
And the communications?

46:37.047 --> 46:38.446
Engineering's running
a dedicated line

46:38.448 --> 46:40.415
to both the dish
and the Command Center

46:40.417 --> 46:42.250
that goes all the way to D.C.

46:42.252 --> 46:44.052
Engineering's doing
their best right now.

46:44.054 --> 46:45.420
Sir, please.

46:45.422 --> 46:47.023
Detaining Gwen
is a grave mistake.

46:47.025 --> 46:48.824
No one is more steeped in
this research than she is.

46:48.826 --> 46:50.960
We are dealing with
global threats right now,

46:50.962 --> 46:52.727
not on Gwen Armstrong's latest
free-association.

46:52.729 --> 46:57.632
- You're team is relieved.
- I's an asteroid!

46:57.634 --> 47:00.569
I have proof,
undeniable proof.

47:00.571 --> 47:02.304
I just needed to wait
for the information

47:02.306 --> 47:03.806
to come in to create
a spectral image.

47:03.808 --> 47:05.574
There over 100 observatories.

47:05.576 --> 47:06.976
The observatories
can't see it.

47:06.978 --> 47:08.610
And it wo't show up on radar

47:08.612 --> 47:10.078
until it emerges out of
meteor cloud that's covering.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.513
And then it's gonna hit earth.

47:11.515 --> 47:13.448
I don't see how
a rainbow reflected back

47:13.450 --> 47:16.353
from a meteor cloud can create
an image like this, doctor.

47:19.323 --> 47:21.690
We kept picking up
a dense section on our radar.

47:21.692 --> 47:23.993
It failed to yield
anything definitive,

47:23.995 --> 47:27.195
but I knew that something
was acting on these meteors,

47:27.197 --> 47:28.764
slowing them down.

47:28.766 --> 47:32.302
So I took a sustained
spectrometer reading and...

47:35.639 --> 47:37.608
There it is.

47:46.283 --> 47:47.616
So yo're telling us
this asteroid

47:47.618 --> 47:50.352
is cloaked
by its own meteor shower?

47:50.354 --> 47:52.120
This is the sun, okay?

47:52.122 --> 47:56.291
During it's last perihelion,
Phaeton was knocked off course,

47:56.293 --> 47:59.396
causing it to go back
into the meteor trail.

48:00.631 --> 48:02.197
When it finally caught
up with the meteors,

48:02.199 --> 48:04.100
it exerted its own
gravitational force,

48:04.102 --> 48:06.869
causing the meteors to slow down
and making them safe

48:06.871 --> 48:09.537
to actually enter into
our own atmosphere,

48:09.539 --> 48:11.876
which is what's causing
the meteor storm outside.

48:13.510 --> 48:16.411
So even if we were to
destroy all of the meteors,

48:16.413 --> 48:19.180
we still have a 2.6-mile
asteroid to destroy.

48:19.182 --> 48:20.983
Where will it strike?

48:20.985 --> 48:24.319
Difficult to say,
which is why Dr. Siegel

48:24.321 --> 48:26.655
has run a sequencing
algorithm. Kurt?

48:26.657 --> 48:29.257
Its trajectory places
it on the northernmost tip

48:29.259 --> 48:32.895
of Manitoba, 1,538 miles
west of the bay.

48:32.897 --> 48:34.964
Fortunately, I was able
to upload its vector

48:34.966 --> 48:37.265
to a priority list before
the last power outage.

48:37.267 --> 48:39.200
I's far from
a populated area.

48:39.202 --> 48:40.836
That does't matter, sir.

48:40.838 --> 48:44.339
The force will be equivalent
to one million Hiroshimas.

48:44.341 --> 48:47.642
So that's why you fought
so hard to stop Level Five?

48:47.644 --> 48:49.011
Exactly.

48:49.013 --> 48:51.013
Now with what we have,
we need a surgical response.

48:51.015 --> 48:53.149
- Surgical?
- Mara?

48:53.151 --> 48:55.084
We have about
2,000 warheads left.

48:55.086 --> 48:57.686
At 50 megatons each,
tha's 100,000 megatons,

48:57.688 --> 49:00.956
- 50,000 per stage of attack.
- Good.

49:00.958 --> 49:02.758
So it has't reached
a million megatons yet.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.225
We need to use half
of our remaining nukes

49:04.227 --> 49:06.461
to dissipate the meteor cloud,

49:06.463 --> 49:08.396
then shoot the other
half straight

49:08.398 --> 49:09.967
at the asteroid to destroy it.

49:16.074 --> 49:19.443
Sir, we're back online.
All systems are active.

49:21.946 --> 49:24.713
Daniels, you need to get
Joe Ambrose on the phone.

49:24.715 --> 49:27.449
And, you, go get your husband.

49:27.451 --> 49:28.886
Copy that.

50:24.909 --> 50:25.908
Michael?

50:25.910 --> 50:27.342
Oh my God.

50:27.344 --> 50:29.277
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, God.

50:29.279 --> 50:30.712
I was so scared.

50:30.714 --> 50:32.649
I was so afraid
you got hurt out there.

50:34.651 --> 50:36.451
Is there any update?

50:36.453 --> 50:38.020
They need you in Command.

50:38.022 --> 50:40.089
W've proven that
there's an asteroid.

50:40.091 --> 50:41.891
Is Colonel Singh working
with the Pentagon?

50:41.893 --> 50:46.730
He is and he needs
you and me, the entire team.

50:47.731 --> 50:49.064
- Come on.
- Let's go.

50:49.066 --> 50:50.567
Let's go.

51:02.712 --> 51:04.412
Sir, we just
received a priority alert

51:04.414 --> 51:05.781
on the data cloud.

51:05.783 --> 51:07.649
So has every other
major observatory

51:07.651 --> 51:09.651
across three continents.

51:09.653 --> 51:11.452
Who's sending this out?

51:11.454 --> 51:14.089
NASA, JPL, AMS and FEMA
just forwarded it

51:14.091 --> 51:15.590
from our base in Wyoming.

51:15.592 --> 51:17.193
I's a live vectoring model.

51:17.195 --> 51:19.360
What do the vectors target?

51:19.362 --> 51:20.930
We do't know, sir.

51:20.932 --> 51:23.866
I's a field, sir,
with precise measurements,

51:23.868 --> 51:25.968
2.18 miles,

51:25.970 --> 51:29.504
1.31 miles, 2.62.

51:34.611 --> 51:36.278
I have Ambrose
on the line, sir.

51:36.280 --> 51:39.114
Ah...

51:39.116 --> 51:40.850
General Ambrose?

51:40.852 --> 51:43.185
I's Colonel Singh. Wyoming.

51:43.187 --> 51:46.354
Our research team just confirmed
a million megaton, sir.

51:46.356 --> 51:47.923
Mm-hm.

51:47.925 --> 51:50.025
We have a Near Earth Object
with all intel

51:50.027 --> 51:51.559
uploaded to DOD's data.

51:56.868 --> 51:59.301
General!
W're calling for a two-stage...

52:02.739 --> 52:04.706
Phew!

52:04.708 --> 52:06.474
General, we have to
launch these missiles now!

52:06.476 --> 52:09.377
Phaeton's gravitation field is
accelerating the meteor shower.

52:09.379 --> 52:11.646
I's only gonna get worse!

52:11.648 --> 52:13.717
This whole place
is gonna blow!

52:21.859 --> 52:23.691
Sir! Wyoming has been hit!

52:23.693 --> 52:25.227
Without the orbital shield,

52:25.229 --> 52:27.629
Phaetho's projecting
meteors straight at us.

52:27.631 --> 52:29.365
Do we have any communication?

52:29.367 --> 52:31.499
Sir, we have a signal, but
it keeps cutting in and out.

52:31.501 --> 52:33.035
Colonel Singh would't
have called

52:33.037 --> 52:35.237
unless he was requesting
a severe response.

52:35.239 --> 52:39.074
Keep working to get the
remaining of our nukes operable.

52:39.076 --> 52:40.378
Copy that, sir.

52:43.647 --> 52:45.446
All right, the main
evacuation rout is this way.

52:45.448 --> 52:47.216
Come on.

52:47.218 --> 52:48.516
Oh, we ca't leave until
we make sure that Ambrose

52:48.518 --> 52:50.252
has the proper information.

52:50.254 --> 52:51.653
We ca't stay, Gwen.
The base has been compromised.

52:51.655 --> 52:52.922
I's too dangerous.
Come on!

52:52.924 --> 52:54.722
I need to see this through.

52:54.724 --> 52:56.358
Okay, I'm not leaving until
I'm sure that

52:56.360 --> 52:57.625
the're gonna launch everything
according to plan.

52:57.627 --> 52:59.061
Sir! Come on!

52:59.063 --> 53:01.063
We have to evacuate
to Washington now!

53:01.065 --> 53:04.168
Gwen, we need to leave now.
Please?

53:05.369 --> 53:08.172
Michael, no!

53:11.441 --> 53:13.208
You okay?

53:13.210 --> 53:14.410
Yeah, yeah.

53:14.412 --> 53:16.111
- Okay, where do we go?
- Okay.

53:16.113 --> 53:19.415
All right, we need to exit back
through the Command Room.

53:19.417 --> 53:21.150
- Come on.
- Okay. Let's go.

53:31.494 --> 53:33.062
You okay?

53:33.064 --> 53:35.900
Yeah. You?

53:38.936 --> 53:42.139
Michael, wher's
the Control Room?

53:45.675 --> 53:47.411
Straight this way.

53:49.013 --> 53:50.511
All right.

53:50.513 --> 53:51.512
W'll go through the wall.

53:52.917 --> 53:54.986
W're not going
through that wall.

53:57.254 --> 53:59.154
Tha's solid concrete
six inches thick.

53:59.156 --> 54:03.461
W'll cut straight
through with this, hm?

54:10.267 --> 54:12.103
Almost there.

54:14.738 --> 54:16.405
- You through?
- Yep.

54:16.407 --> 54:17.439
- Go for it.
- Here goes nothing!

54:17.441 --> 54:18.943
Yep.

54:20.710 --> 54:23.511
- Good.
- Nice job.

54:38.929 --> 54:41.098
The roo's collapsed here, too.

54:45.770 --> 54:47.870
We can get there through
the annex bridge.

54:47.872 --> 54:49.371
- Okay?
- Yeah.

54:49.373 --> 54:51.739
Thanks.

54:51.741 --> 54:53.511
This way!

55:05.823 --> 55:07.990
Wyoming!
Go for Ambrose!

55:07.992 --> 55:09.792
General, this is
Gwen Armstrong.

55:09.794 --> 55:12.027
Do you have a
confirmed target?

55:12.029 --> 55:14.196
I's an asteroid, sir.
Two-square miles.

55:14.198 --> 55:15.431
I've sent you all
the data.

55:15.433 --> 55:17.732
What is the ETA to impact?

55:17.734 --> 55:19.201
One hour and 15 minutes.

55:19.203 --> 55:20.735
The strike requires
a two-step response,

55:20.737 --> 55:22.570
50% into the meteor cloud

55:22.572 --> 55:24.739
and 50% directly into
the asteroid.

55:24.741 --> 55:25.740
No! Gwen!

55:34.218 --> 55:35.953
Whoa!

55:37.587 --> 55:38.653
Babe, you okay?

55:38.655 --> 55:40.055
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You?

55:40.057 --> 55:40.989
Yeah.

55:40.991 --> 55:42.657
Go! Get to the entrance!

55:42.659 --> 55:45.029
Mara, go, go, go, go!

55:51.368 --> 55:52.801
Just get to the entrance!

55:52.803 --> 55:54.438
I'll come.

55:55.773 --> 55:57.973
- Colonel, go!
- Go, just go! Go!

55:57.975 --> 56:00.444
Help the others,
I'm right behind you.

56:01.479 --> 56:02.677
Gwen, come on, baby!

56:02.679 --> 56:05.349
Okay, okay, w're coming.

56:06.317 --> 56:08.784
Oh, man.

56:08.786 --> 56:09.785
Come on!

56:14.792 --> 56:16.327
Gwen, come on!

56:27.404 --> 56:29.406
Here! Take my hand.

56:31.008 --> 56:32.476
Come on! Let go of the bag!

56:36.180 --> 56:37.982
No!

56:39.517 --> 56:41.617
I can lift you!

56:41.619 --> 56:44.021
I shoul've listened
to you from the start.

56:47.525 --> 56:49.326
Oh...

57:12.917 --> 57:15.851
All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

57:15.853 --> 57:18.887
Our two-mile wide field
is an incoming asteroid.

57:18.889 --> 57:20.688
Sir, are we talking
about the one

57:20.690 --> 57:21.857
that disappeared behind the sun?
Phaeton?

57:21.859 --> 57:23.325
Tha's affirmative.

57:23.327 --> 57:25.693
We need to use the rest
of our nukes

57:25.695 --> 57:28.297
on a stage-two
Level Five response.

57:28.299 --> 57:30.966
We need to set our
targeting system

57:30.968 --> 57:33.435
so that the first wave
of nukes all hit

57:33.437 --> 57:37.539
the exact same spot
of the meteor cloud.

57:37.541 --> 57:40.375
That will create a compound
wave to dissipate the cloud

57:40.377 --> 57:43.078
and reveal the bigger asteroid
so we can target it.

57:43.080 --> 57:46.381
Tha's brilliant, sir!

57:46.383 --> 57:50.052
This is Gwen Armstron's plan,
and yes it is.

57:50.054 --> 57:53.555
Sir? We just lost two more
communication satellites.

57:53.557 --> 57:57.659
But we do have communication
with other surviving bases.

57:57.661 --> 57:59.795
Prepare for the first wave!

57:59.797 --> 58:01.630
Yes, sir.

58:01.632 --> 58:02.965
Stand by!

58:02.967 --> 58:04.501
Level Five!

58:07.905 --> 58:09.440
Level Five is go.

58:13.611 --> 58:15.412
Level Five is go.

58:22.453 --> 58:24.453
Level Five is go.

58:24.455 --> 58:27.258
50% response! Go!

59:02.960 --> 59:06.763
Heat signature at 4%, 2%.

59:06.765 --> 59:08.130
Sir, it's working!

59:08.132 --> 59:10.599
The cloud is beginning
to dissipate.

59:10.601 --> 59:12.636
Heat signature one percent.

59:18.609 --> 59:20.509
Level Five, stage two!

59:20.511 --> 59:22.644
Target that asteroid.

59:22.646 --> 59:25.015
50% Go!

59:38.729 --> 59:40.195
The asteroid is still intact.

59:40.197 --> 59:41.897
The nukes were ineffective, sir.

59:41.899 --> 59:43.832
They were unable to make
contact with target.

59:43.834 --> 59:46.435
Damn it!

59:46.437 --> 59:49.004
Impact estimated
at 38 minutes.

59:49.006 --> 59:51.139
Make sure the President,
Congress

59:51.141 --> 59:53.342
and Joint Chiefs of
Staff are evacuated

59:53.344 --> 59:56.180
- to the Doomsday Bunker.
- Yes, sir!

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:01.583
We are now being informed
that the mission

01:00:01.585 --> 01:00:05.153
to destroy the incoming
asteroid was unsuccessful.

01:00:05.155 --> 01:00:07.456
A general evacuation order
has been issued

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:10.525
for the entire East Coast
of the United States.

01:00:10.527 --> 01:00:12.694
W've also received word
that the presiden's motorcade

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:17.099
is being redirected to the Raven
rock bunker in Pennsylvania.

01:00:17.101 --> 01:00:18.433
God help us all.

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:19.701
Gwen?

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.370
- Gwen!
- No! We have to go!

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:23.505
No! W're not having another
Russia incident!

01:00:23.507 --> 01:00:25.240
Michael, with all due respect,
you were not there!

01:00:25.242 --> 01:00:26.875
She did what she was
supposed to be doing.

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:29.578
Did she? She had 15 minutes
before that order came in

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.213
to ground those planes!

01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:34.116
Gwen! Are you okay?

01:00:34.118 --> 01:00:36.918
I gave her
the orders, Michael.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.020
It was my fault, okay?

01:00:39.022 --> 01:00:40.722
We were supposed
to meet Kurt in Russia!

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.792
I'm the one that told her
to stay behind.

01:00:42.794 --> 01:00:45.026
It was my fault, Michael.

01:00:45.028 --> 01:00:47.729
She stayed because of me.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.998
Well, they didn't have to
pin the whole thing on you.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.334
Michael...

01:00:52.336 --> 01:00:56.671
Okay! How much time
do we have left, Gwen?

01:00:56.673 --> 01:00:58.306
We have 34 minutes.

01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:00.976
And we already launched
Phase One and Phase Two

01:01:00.978 --> 01:01:02.577
of the nukes, right?

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:04.413
So what's Plan B, guys?

01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:06.148
Plan B is we make
our way to the airfield

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.616
about a mile from here.

01:01:07.618 --> 01:01:08.950
Now there's two birds
on the ground.

01:01:08.952 --> 01:01:10.652
We evac to safety, all of us!

01:01:10.654 --> 01:01:12.988
No, no, no.
W're not gonna evacuate yet.

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:14.456
Look, there could be
a solution here.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:18.026
I's a long shot,
but it could work.

01:01:18.028 --> 01:01:19.728
The Braeburg Effect.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:20.929
Braeburg?

01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:22.397
Come on, Gwen, enough of that!

01:01:22.399 --> 01:01:23.965
You know he's a laughing
stock of our community!

01:01:23.967 --> 01:01:25.700
Okay, but, Kurt,
listen to me, okay?

01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:27.837
The last few hours,
I've been noticing

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:29.971
that all this meteor impact
has displaced methane

01:01:29.973 --> 01:01:31.406
into the atmosphere.

01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:32.875
When you add
an electrical force to methane

01:01:32.877 --> 01:01:34.811
it turns into plasma vapor.

01:01:34.813 --> 01:01:38.013
Now the tests I took this
morning of that meteor,

01:01:38.015 --> 01:01:39.681
it proves that it
has magnetic force.

01:01:39.683 --> 01:01:43.685
So if we somehow find
6,000 megawatts of electricity

01:01:43.687 --> 01:01:47.122
and create an electrical arc
up into the atmosphere,

01:01:47.124 --> 01:01:48.490
it could actually displace

01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:49.926
that electromagnetic force
and then....

01:01:49.928 --> 01:01:51.761
And the nukes
and the meteors

01:01:51.763 --> 01:01:52.994
and the asteroid all
crashing together.

01:01:52.996 --> 01:01:54.864
Yes, and destroy them.

01:01:54.866 --> 01:01:56.398
Okay, I understand that,

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.133
but where are we gonna get that
power, that wattage?

01:01:58.135 --> 01:02:00.702
We do't have that.

01:02:00.704 --> 01:02:02.671
There's a power plant
not far from the airfield.

01:02:02.673 --> 01:02:04.139
Can we use that?

01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:06.241
Yes, but we would
need some sort of...

01:02:06.243 --> 01:02:07.642
A massive controlled
explosion!

01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:09.177
Exactly.

01:02:09.179 --> 01:02:11.146
One of those F-35s has
to be stocked with missiles.

01:02:11.148 --> 01:02:12.849
Okay, okay.
Let's go to the hangar!

01:02:12.851 --> 01:02:14.149
Let's go! Let's go!

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:15.586
Okay, let's get
to the airfield!

01:02:22.526 --> 01:02:23.960
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

01:02:23.962 --> 01:02:26.196
Okay, the base
is through the field!

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.032
For those of you at home
or hopefully

01:02:31.034 --> 01:02:32.400
having found shelter,

01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:34.871
we have an update
from Pentagon officials.

01:02:34.873 --> 01:02:38.340
Raging fires are widespread
throughout North America

01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:41.009
as a result of
the massive meteor shore.

01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:45.547
Hundreds of thousands of home
have been damaged or destroyed.

01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:49.651
Injuries and deaths are
estimated to be in the hundreds.

01:02:49.653 --> 01:02:52.420
The national weather service is
now reporting that this storm

01:02:52.422 --> 01:02:55.123
is due to a
gravitational slowdown

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:57.259
from inside of the meteor cloud,

01:02:57.261 --> 01:02:59.929
caused by
two-mile-wide Phaethon asteroid

01:02:59.931 --> 01:03:04.266
which is due to impact
Earth within the hour.

01:03:04.268 --> 01:03:06.635
Come on, guys!
Come on! Come on!

01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:08.303
Come on!

01:03:08.305 --> 01:03:10.907
Let's go! Come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:03:10.909 --> 01:03:14.879
Come on! Move it! Move it!
Let's go, Kurt. Come on!

01:03:20.083 --> 01:03:22.752
Whoa!

01:04:21.045 --> 01:04:22.646
Come on! Come on!

01:04:24.381 --> 01:04:26.483
Let's go!
This way, this way!

01:04:28.853 --> 01:04:29.988
Whoa!

01:04:32.023 --> 01:04:33.555
Okay! I can see it!

01:04:33.557 --> 01:04:34.957
Another 300 yards
and w're there!

01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:36.959
Let's go! Come on!
Move, move, move!

01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:38.695
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

01:04:49.373 --> 01:04:51.809
Down, down, down!
Get down! Down!

01:04:56.613 --> 01:04:58.080
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:04:58.082 --> 01:04:59.147
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:00.950
Okay, okay.

01:05:00.952 --> 01:05:03.919
Mara, you scour this field.

01:05:03.921 --> 01:05:05.253
Find that jet.

01:05:05.255 --> 01:05:06.922
Let's just pray
that puppy is armed

01:05:06.924 --> 01:05:07.923
with striking capabilities.

01:05:07.925 --> 01:05:09.424
I got it.

01:05:09.426 --> 01:05:10.826
Now this incoming
w're experiencing,

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.094
I can only imagine
is gonna get worse.

01:05:12.096 --> 01:05:13.428
So, Kurt, you go with her.

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:15.097
You ensure her success, okay?

01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:16.431
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:17.867
- Copy that.
- All right.

01:05:17.869 --> 01:05:19.401
Gwen and I are gonna
locate a power source.

01:05:19.403 --> 01:05:20.903
The transformer is on

01:05:20.905 --> 01:05:22.972
the other side of the
airfield, due west.

01:05:22.974 --> 01:05:25.875
Okay, perfect.
Meet back here.

01:05:29.279 --> 01:05:32.716
Okay, go! Go! Go!

01:05:44.728 --> 01:05:46.697
Gwen, come on!

01:05:50.134 --> 01:05:52.602
Okay, go! Go!
Go! Go!

01:05:58.009 --> 01:05:59.743
Okay, okay.

01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:04.882
Gwen? Come on.

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:09.919
There!
There it is.

01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:12.788
I see it! Let's go!

01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:15.991
Okay.

01:06:15.993 --> 01:06:17.461
Okay, go.

01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:27.136
Okay. Hand me the iPad, Gwen!

01:06:27.138 --> 01:06:28.806
All right.

01:06:30.174 --> 01:06:32.174
Oh, God!

01:06:32.176 --> 01:06:34.810
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:34.812 --> 01:06:36.178
- Okay.
- Here you go, Michael.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.278
Hold it.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.513
Okay.

01:06:38.515 --> 01:06:40.248
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.753
Okay.

01:06:45.957 --> 01:06:47.091
Oh!

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.061
Please make this fast, okay?

01:06:52.063 --> 01:06:53.461
I'm trying, I'm trying,
I'm trying.

01:06:53.463 --> 01:06:54.797
- W're in!
- Okay.

01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:56.331
Okay.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:58.801
My security clearance should
give me access to the main grid.

01:06:58.803 --> 01:07:00.870
Okay, I'm redirecting
all kilowatts

01:07:00.872 --> 01:07:05.875
within a 100-mile radius
to transformer 47.

01:07:05.877 --> 01:07:06.976
Okay. 47.

01:07:06.978 --> 01:07:08.343
What are those coordinates,
Michael?

01:07:08.345 --> 01:07:09.444
Give me a minute.

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:21.893
Ah!

01:07:24.028 --> 01:07:25.227
Are you okay?

01:07:25.229 --> 01:07:26.228
Are you having fun yet, doc?

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:27.595
Am I having fun?

01:07:27.597 --> 01:07:30.065
You're crazy.
Come on. Come on, Mara.

01:07:30.067 --> 01:07:31.466
Come on.
Come on, Mara.

01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:33.838
Almost there, come on.

01:07:40.244 --> 01:07:42.546
Okay. You're okay.

01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:46.248
There's the entrance
to the hangar.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.919
Let's go, go, go, go!

01:07:58.963 --> 01:08:00.495
Got'em!
Sending to you now!

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:01.663
- Okay, great.
- You got'em.

01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:05.034
Plugging those in, the equation.

01:08:05.036 --> 01:08:06.304
Let's see if this works.

01:08:08.873 --> 01:08:10.775
Put that here.

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:13.976
Put this...

01:08:13.978 --> 01:08:18.712
So with that frequency,
those coordinates,

01:08:18.715 --> 01:08:22.350
that dimension,
at that speed...

01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:23.685
What do you got, baby?

01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:25.321
This is gonna work...

01:08:25.323 --> 01:08:27.156
Michael, it's gonna work.

01:08:27.158 --> 01:08:29.992
Okay.

01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:33.863
- Come on, Gwen! Come on!
- We gotta go!

01:08:33.865 --> 01:08:35.131
Let's go!

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:48.844
W're gonna have
to taxi this jet.

01:08:48.845 --> 01:08:50.312
Yeah.

01:08:50.314 --> 01:08:52.049
Who's the chauffer now?

01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:00.724
Mara?

01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:04.161
There's no missiles.

01:09:04.828 --> 01:09:06.229
There's no missiles.

01:09:11.167 --> 01:09:12.902
We gotta go tell 'em.

01:09:12.904 --> 01:09:15.305
Let's go tell'em.
Come on.

01:09:16.506 --> 01:09:18.242
Come on

01:09:19.475 --> 01:09:21.379
Damn it.
Come on.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.515
Mara! Kurt!

01:09:27.517 --> 01:09:29.651
F-35, end of the tarmac.

01:09:29.653 --> 01:09:31.685
- 10% fuel.
- I's okay.

01:09:31.688 --> 01:09:34.924
Gwen, there's no missiles.

01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:35.890
Shit!

01:09:35.893 --> 01:09:38.227
- Um...
- Tha's it.

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:39.828
What?

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:43.267
I's over.
There's nothing we can do.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.669
There's got to be.
Okay.

01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:48.837
There's nothing
left we can do!

01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:52.174
The jet becomes the missile.

01:09:52.176 --> 01:09:55.244
By taking off,
the jet becomes the missile.

01:09:55.246 --> 01:09:57.679
I just take off and fly it
straight up into the air

01:09:57.681 --> 01:09:59.815
and come down at Mach speed
to that electrical plant

01:09:59.817 --> 01:10:01.383
and hit it right in the
center...

01:10:01.385 --> 01:10:02.617
Gwen, what are
you talking about?

01:10:02.619 --> 01:10:03.852
No on's getting
inside that jet!

01:10:03.854 --> 01:10:05.356
Tha's a suicide mission!

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:08.759
And you know what?
There's gotta be another way!

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:12.094
You're not thinking straight.

01:10:12.096 --> 01:10:14.163
No.
No on's getting into that jet!

01:10:14.165 --> 01:10:16.432
I's over.

01:10:16.434 --> 01:10:18.067
Just get me into the sat com.
I'll figure it out.

01:10:18.069 --> 01:10:19.835
Just link to help me back up
with the nukes.

01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:21.305
Okay, you can do that
through the computer.

01:10:28.478 --> 01:10:30.478
Here we go.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.217
The fuel is at 10%.

01:10:34.385 --> 01:10:37.585
- Gwen? Gwen!
- Gwen! Gwen!

01:10:37.587 --> 01:10:39.154
Michael stop, she's gone.

01:10:39.156 --> 01:10:43.558
Her best bet will be
to parachute into an open field

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.928
We gotta get to an open field.
We gotta get to an open field!

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:47.528
Come on, le's go!
Move it!

01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:50.334
- Let's go find an open field!
- Come on, come on!

01:10:56.874 --> 01:10:59.308
Initiate flight sequencing.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:04.746
On, engaged.
Engine one, on.

01:11:04.748 --> 01:11:07.118
Flight time: three minutes.

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:15.059
Let's do this.

01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:18.927
Okay, come here!

01:11:18.929 --> 01:11:20.695
She's gotta land here, okay?

01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:22.064
This is the only spot
that she can land.

01:11:22.066 --> 01:11:24.068
All right.

01:11:28.705 --> 01:11:30.671
Gwen, do you copy?

01:11:30.673 --> 01:11:32.810
I read you five
by five, Michael.

01:11:34.677 --> 01:11:36.247
Engine engaged.

01:12:35.039 --> 01:12:37.573
Sir, our radar is
detecting an object

01:12:37.575 --> 01:12:40.776
moving the speed of sound
flying up out of Wyoming.

01:12:40.778 --> 01:12:42.945
- Do we have an ID on it?
- No.

01:12:42.947 --> 01:12:45.116
We do't know
what it is yet, sir.

01:13:01.966 --> 01:13:03.601
Starting ascent.

01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:16.711
Gwen!

01:13:16.713 --> 01:13:18.315
Come in, Gwen!
Gwen, come in!

01:13:46.977 --> 01:13:50.080
Looks like it's one of ours,
sir, an F-35.

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:01.559
One minute, three seconds.

01:14:05.396 --> 01:14:06.828
T-minus 1 minute.

01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:08.230
Engaging F35 dive

01:14:08.232 --> 01:14:10.698
in 5, 4,

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.138
3, 2, 1, now!

01:14:17.208 --> 01:14:18.941
Gwen, you get outta there!

01:14:18.943 --> 01:14:21.145
You make sure you get
outta there, Gwen!

01:14:24.114 --> 01:14:25.914
Gwen, do you copy?
Make sure you get outta there!

01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:27.549
Come on, Gwen.

01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:29.553
45 seconds!

01:14:37.461 --> 01:14:41.530
I'm getting high level
radiation warnings.

01:14:41.532 --> 01:14:43.434
Damn it, come on.

01:14:57.815 --> 01:15:01.483
Really starting to feel
the Gs, here.

01:15:01.485 --> 01:15:04.453
Ejecting in 10, 9...

01:15:04.455 --> 01:15:07.258
Eight, seven, six...

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:14.131
Five...

01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:17.034
four...

01:15:18.335 --> 01:15:20.437
Three...

01:15:30.547 --> 01:15:32.149
Gwen, do you copy?

01:16:08.919 --> 01:16:11.488
One.

01:16:26.837 --> 01:16:28.505
They did it!

01:16:32.009 --> 01:16:33.709
The target!

01:16:33.711 --> 01:16:35.344
The target has been neutralized!

01:16:35.346 --> 01:16:37.379
You heard correctly,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:39.881
The asteroi's been destroyed!

01:16:41.919 --> 01:16:43.852
W're clear!
W're all clear!

01:16:43.854 --> 01:16:45.189
Oh, my God.

01:16:47.991 --> 01:16:50.625
Lieutenant Armstrong,
we can confirm

01:16:50.627 --> 01:16:53.061
Phaeton has been eliminated.
Is your wife all right?

01:16:53.063 --> 01:16:55.530
Where is she?
Where is she?

01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:56.965
Gwen!

01:16:56.967 --> 01:16:59.034
Lieutenant Armstrong!
Do you copy?

01:16:59.036 --> 01:17:00.805
Where is she?

01:17:02.841 --> 01:17:06.778
General, this is Dr. Siegel,
no sign of her yet.

01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:09.580
Where is she?

01:17:17.822 --> 01:17:19.323
There!

01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:27.231
We have a visual on
Dr. Armstrong, sh's alive!

01:17:28.065 --> 01:17:29.566
She made it!

01:17:34.037 --> 01:17:38.175
Woo! Woo!

01:17:54.925 --> 01:17:57.161
She's coming in for a landing.

01:18:06.703 --> 01:18:08.970
Oh...

01:18:17.714 --> 01:18:20.184
Hey, doc.

01:18:29.059 --> 01:18:30.862
You're crazy.

01:18:32.563 --> 01:18:34.164
I had to.

01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:39.201
What was the probability
of that happening, huh?

01:18:39.203 --> 01:18:41.303
We did it.

01:18:41.305 --> 01:18:43.808
You're crazy... you're crazy.

01:18:48.645 --> 01:18:49.948
You did it...

01:18:51.982 --> 01:18:53.381
Dr. Braeburg.

01:18:53.383 --> 01:18:55.517
Shh. The world does't
need to know.

01:18:55.519 --> 01:18:57.954
- The world needs to know.
- No, no, no.

01:18:57.956 --> 01:19:00.925
No. The world is safe now.

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:15.840
Kurt! Mara!

01:19:17.641 --> 01:19:20.711
Woo! Woo!

01:19:21.578 --> 01:19:23.779
What a team!

01:19:23.781 --> 01:19:27.718
Well done, Colonel... sir.

01:19:32.456 --> 01:19:34.291
Phew!
