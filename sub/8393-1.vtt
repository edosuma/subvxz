IT'S ROUGH OUT THERE.

YOU CAN THANK YOUR BROTHER
CROSBY FOR THAT.

01:23.010 --> 01:25.763

I MADE BRUNCH.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.378
I MADE FRENCH TOAST

01:45.480 --> 01:47.163
IT'S WELL-DONE,
THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.090
YOU REMEMBER THAT I SAID
I WAS GONNA MAKE BRUNCH?

01:49.210 --> 01:50.518
- YEAH, I'M GOOD

APPRECIATE IT IF YOU DIDN'T--

02:02.570 --> 02:03.878
WHEN YOU'RE DONE WATCHING
THE SHOW,

02:03.980 --> 02:06.039
IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH IT
WHEN SYDNEY'S AROUND, OKAY?

02:24.480 --> 02:25.822
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:25.930 --> 02:28.581
BURGER AND PIE IS OUR PLACE.
WE LOVE BURGER AND PIE.

02:28.700 --> 02:29.894
- WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.
- YEAH, HONEY.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.592
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
SHE LEANED OVER THE BACKSEAT

02:32.700 --> 02:35.009
AND WAS LIKE, "I KNOW,
LET'S GO TO BURGER AND PIE."

02:35.120 --> 02:36.314
- I WAS EIGHT
AND I DON'T CARE.

02:36.430 --> 02:37.658
I HAVE TO SPEND TIME
WITH MY FRIENDS.

02:37.770 --> 02:38.634
THIS IS THE LAST WEEK.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.253
both: LET'S ALL GO
- STOP!

02:40.360 --> 02:41.941
both: TO BURGER AND PIE
- STOP!

02:42.050 --> 02:43.426
IT'S THE LAST WEEK
BEFORE I LEAVE.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.700
- EXACTLY, IT'S TIME
TO SPEND WITH FAMILY.

02:44.810 --> 02:46.539
- HONEY, LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THERE'S A LOT TO DO,

02:46.640 --> 02:49.222
WHICH I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD
MEET BEFORE BURGER AND PIE,

02:49.340 --> 02:50.432
GET YOUR WINTER COAT--
JUST LISTEN.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.814
- NO.
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, HONEY.

02:51.930 --> 02:53.955
- GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.
- I CAN'T. I DON'T NEED A COAT.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.230
- DO YOU KNOW HOW COLD
IT IS THERE?

02:55.340 --> 02:56.648
- EVERY OTHER DAY,
I'M WITH THE GRANDPARENTS

02:56.760 --> 02:59.206
OR WITH THE AUNTS OR SOME--
OR IT'S A DUMB PHOTO SHOOT.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.277
I NEED TIME ON MY OWN...

03:00.380 --> 03:01.483
- IT'S NOT A DUMB
PHOTO SHOOT.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.239
- WITH MY FRIENDS.
- OKAY? IT'S REALLY NOT.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.454
ALL OF YOUR GRANDPARENTS,
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.720
YOUR AUNTS AND UNCLES, OKAY?
- IT'S FINE.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.387
- EVERYONE'S GE'I'I'ING TOGETHER
FOR YOU.

03:08.490 --> 03:09.764
AND I ALSO THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
SCHEDULE SOME TIME FOR MAX.

03:09.870 --> 03:12.350
- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
BURGER AND PIE WAS.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.734
- NO, BURGER AND PIE
IS FAMILY TIME.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.216
I WANT YOU AND MAX TO HAVE
A LITTLE TIME TOGETHER.

03:15.330 --> 03:16.661
- OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.600
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA, THOSE
EAST COAST WINTERS ARE BRUTAL.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.325
- UGH.
- MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON

03:20.440 --> 03:21.839
THAT EVERYONE AT CORNELL
KILLS THEMSELVES.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.575
- WIND WHIPS IN YOUR FACE.
- OH, MY GOD.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.578
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, MAX.
- YEAH, IT IS DAD.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.601
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YES, IT IS.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.880
I SAW IT ONLINE.
- IT'S A RUMOR.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.230
- PEOPLE THERE JUMP OFF--
- HEY, CAN WE STOP?

03:28.340 --> 03:29.614
- YOUR SISTER'S NOT GONNA
JUMP OFF A BRIDGE.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.234
- I'LL JUMP OFF A BRIDGE
IF I STAY HERE.

03:32.350 --> 03:33.271
- YOU NEED A COAT.
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.927
- EXACTLY.
- EXACTLY.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.009

03:38.110 --> 03:38.895
IS SOMEONE

SOMEONE I CAN HOLD ON

04:24.050 --> 04:25.699

BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
I WON'T KNOW WHOSE IS WHICH.

- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE HIRED YOU

08:14.970 --> 08:16.449
AND EXPECTS YOU TO GO ON
A PHOTO SHOOT TOMORROW

08:16.560 --> 08:17.720
WITH NO EXPERIENCE.
- WELL...

08:17.840 --> 08:18.761
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- HE DOESN'T EXACTLY KNOW

08:18.870 --> 08:21.805
I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.
- YOU LIED?

08:21.910 --> 08:24.777
- YOU'VE NEVER LIED
IN A JOB INTERVIEW?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.531
OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T.
GOD, I DON'T KNOW.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.222
ANYWAY, HE'S A VERY WEIRD,
GRUMPY GUY.

08:30.330 --> 08:31.911
WHO KNOWS IF
IT'LL EVEN WORK OUT?

08:32.020 --> 08:34.466
- WELL, I, UM--
I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING HIM

08:34.580 --> 08:35.569
AT THE BIG FAMILY PORTRAIT.

08:35.680 --> 08:40.993
- [choking]
- [laughs]

08:41.100 --> 08:42.544
WHAT, ARE YOU CHOKING ON
THAT AWKWARD SEGUE?

08:42.660 --> 08:44.890
- YEAH.
[laughter]

08:45.000 --> 08:48.549
- I PRIDE MYSELF
ON MY AWKWARD SEGUES.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.073
UM, DID YOU, UM--DID YOU
TALK TO YOUR MOM ABOUT IT?

08:52.180 --> 08:54.102
- OF COURSE.
- OKAY.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.313
- LOOK, IT WAS
AN OLD GIRLFRIEND OF CROSBY'S

08:56.430 --> 08:57.567
WHO WRECKED IT
FOR ALL OF US.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.524
MY MOTHER WILL NOT CHANGE
HER MIND. I TRIED.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.700
- OKAY.
IT'S JUST A WEIRD POLICY.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.086
I MEAN...
JUST MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

09:06.200 --> 09:07.428
I-I'M NOT A PART
OF YOUR GUYS' FAMILY...

09:07.540 --> 09:09.019
- OH, MY GOD.
- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ENGAGED

09:09.130 --> 09:11.018
AND...
- YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY.

09:11.130 --> 09:11.983
IT'S A DUMB RULE.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.192
YOU'LL BE IN
THE PICTURE NEXT YEAR.

09:13.310 --> 09:15.062
- OKAY.

09:15.170 --> 09:18.685
DID YOU FIGHT FOR ME?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.929
- OH, HONEY, I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.554
I-I MEAN, I KIND
OF DIDN'T WANT TO GET

09:23.660 --> 09:24.479
INTO A WHOLE THING
WITH HER, SO...

09:24.590 --> 09:28.310
- OH, OKAY.
- I'M SORRY.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.253
- SO KRISTINA WASN'T EVEN
IN THE PICTURE UNTIL THEY WERE--

09:31.360 --> 09:33.009
- NO.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.805
- GOOD NIGHT, GRANDMA.
- OH, I LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.251
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.
- GIVE ME A KISS.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.531
- BRUSH YOUR TEETH.
- MM.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.631
- OKAY.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.843
- OH, THANKS, MOM.
- I COULD EAT HIM WITH A SPOON.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.508
- MM-HMM, HE'S YUMMY.
- [chuckles]

09:45.610 --> 09:47.020
- YEAH, AND SPIRITUAL.

09:47.130 --> 09:49.951
- HE IS.
- AND--AND--AND PRAYERFUL.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.614
- MOM, WE NOTICED THAT
JABBAR HAS BEEN PRAYING.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.279
- IT IS. IT IS.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.518
- YEAH, UM, WE WERE
JUST A LITTLE BIT CURIOUS.

10:02.630 --> 10:04.734
HE TOLD US
THAT YOU EXPLAINED...

10:04.840 --> 10:10.039
GOD AND HEAVEN
AND PRAYING TO HIM.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.115
- YES, AND?

10:11.230 --> 10:13.391
- AND WE WANT HIM
TO KNOW ABOUT RELIGION.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.910
- ABSOLUTELY, HE MUST.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.191
- HMM.
WELL, MUST HE?

10:16.300 --> 10:17.506
I MEAN, OTHER THAN
ITS HISTORICAL CONTEXT.

10:17.610 --> 10:20.170
- CROSBY...

10:20.270 --> 10:21.885
WELL, I GUESS
WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.262
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAD
YOUR CHILDREN,

10:23.380 --> 10:25.848
I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THRILLED

10:25.970 --> 10:29.371
WITH YOUR MOTHER JUST BESTOWING
ALL OF HER RELIGIOUS IDEALS

10:29.490 --> 10:30.934
ONTO YOUR CHILDREN.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.521
AND WE FEEL LIKE MAYBE THAT'S
MORE OUR JOB AS THE PARENTS.

10:34.630 --> 10:37.178
- MOM, WE KNOW IT
CAME FROM A GOOD PLACE.

10:37.290 --> 10:38.314
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,

10:38.430 --> 10:39.738
I DON'T EVEN GO TO CHURCH
ANYMORE REALLY, SO...

10:39.840 --> 10:42.775
- OH, I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.327
- AND WE MAY NOT FEEL EXACTLY
THE SAME AS YOU.

10:46.430 --> 10:48.489
WE THINK THAT
MAYBE IT'S BETTER

10:48.610 --> 10:50.464
FOR YOU TO JUST
LET US HANDLE

10:50.580 --> 10:53.299
TALKING TO JABBAR
ABOUT THE BIG QUESTIONS.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.616
- I SEE.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.449
- GREAT.
[clears throat]

10:59.550 --> 11:03.168
- UM, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

11:03.280 --> 11:07.341
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO SAY TO HIM?

11:10.840 --> 11:14.003
WHAT'S YOUR DOCTRINE?

11:14.120 --> 11:17.009
- [mutters]
OUR DOCTRINE...

11:19.920 --> 11:21.319
- DON'T YOU THINK
THE BOY DESERVES

11:21.430 --> 11:26.299
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF CLARITY ON THE SUBJECT?

11:26.400 --> 11:29.164
[dishes clattering]

11:32.580 --> 11:35.026
- YOU'RE AWESOME.
- SHUT UP.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.062
- I'M SERIOUS.
- SHUT UP.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.889
- HERE, YOU SAID
YOU COULD PLAY GUITAR.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.274
PLAY ME SOMETHING.
- NO, NO, NO.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.550
- NO, COME ON, COME ON.
- NO, DON'T.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.968
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.866
- YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL
MUSICIAN.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.004
IT'S GONNA SOUND VERY BAD.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.520
- COME ON, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

11:49.630 --> 11:50.699
PLEASE, I WANNA HEAR YOU.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.256
- [sighs]
OKAY, HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:53.360 --> 11:56.158
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE
A LITTLE SOMETHING...

11:56.260 --> 11:57.704
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HEAR THIS DITTY.

11:57.820 --> 11:58.707
- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON,
IF YOU WANT TO HEAR IT.

11:58.820 --> 11:59.502
ALL RIGHT, READY?
- YEAH.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.986
- OKAY.

12:01.090 --> 12:03.547
UM, LET ME SEE HOW IT GOES.
IT GOES...

12:03.650 --> 12:05.163
[strums chord]
YEAH, I THINK IT'S THIS.

12:05.270 --> 12:06.407
IT GOES...

12:06.510 --> 12:08.683
ALL I WANT IS SOMEONE
- IS SOMEONE

12:08.790 --> 12:10.166
[laughter]
- NICE.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.419
- DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, HUH?
- THAT'S GOOD.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.511
- ALL I WANT IS SOMEONE
- IS SOMEONE

12:14.630 --> 12:15.619
- WAIT, HERE'S THE BEST PART.

12:15.730 --> 12:17.174
- F...
- I DON'T KNOW IT.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.269
- SOMEONE I CAN HOLD ON
- SOMEONE I CAN

12:18.390 --> 12:22.178
- SOMEONE...
[singing incoherently]

12:22.290 --> 12:23.314
[laughter]

12:23.430 --> 12:24.590
- IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK, RIGHT?
- SOUNDS GOOD.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.452
SOUNDS GOOD.
- SEE? I PICKED IT UP.

12:26.570 --> 12:27.946
- YEAH, YOU'RE GOOD.
- ALL I WANT IS SOMEONE

12:28.050 --> 12:29.847
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE THE LOW?

12:29.950 --> 12:30.803
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.126
both: ALL I WANT

12:32.230 --> 12:35.916
- [laughs]
IS SOMEONE I CAN

12:36.030 --> 12:39.431
[singing gibberish]

12:39.550 --> 12:41.233
- [shrieks]
- [giggIeSJ

12:41.340 --> 12:42.750
- THANK YOU.

12:42.860 --> 12:43.588
- GOOD NIGHT, CHICAGO.
- GOOD NIGHT, CINCINNATI.

12:43.690 --> 12:46.102
- OH, NICE.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.131
DANG.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.549
- THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

12:49.660 --> 12:52.549
[laughter]

13:06.230 --> 13:08.084
- OKAY, I'M GONNA
SHOOT RIGHT HERE.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.747
- OKAY.
- LET'S START WITH THE 2470

13:09.850 --> 13:12.193
AND THE CANON 5D.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.574
- THE--WHICH ONE?
- AND GET THE HASSELBLAD READY

13:13.680 --> 13:14.749
IN CASE I FEEL INSPIRED

13:14.860 --> 13:15.952
TO, YOU KNOW,
SHOOT SOME MEDIUM FORMAT.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.162
- SO, THE...
- 2470.

13:17.270 --> 13:19.204
- FIRST IS--OKAY.

13:19.310 --> 13:21.198
- MR. RIZZOLI, HI.
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

13:21.310 --> 13:22.686
I'M TRISH. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- OH, HEY.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.177
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING
THIS ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.656
I'VE HEARD SUCH AMAZING THINGS
ABOUT YOUR WORK.

13:26.770 --> 13:28.453
- WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE I DON'T
SCREW IT UP TOO MUCH.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.629
- OH, NO, IT WILL BE PERFECT.

13:29.730 --> 13:31.425
BUT IT'S JUST A HARD TIME
FOR MY FAMILY,

13:31.530 --> 13:33.282
SO THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

13:36.780 --> 13:39.089
- IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME
FOR THE FAMILY?

13:39.190 --> 13:40.179
- OH, WE JUST LOST MY FATHER.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.951
- OH, MY GOSH,
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

13:43.060 --> 13:45.642
THAT'S--I'M SO SORRY.
- THANK YOU.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.229
THE FAMILY IS JUST SPREAD OUT
AND WE'RE FINALLY ALL TOGETHER,

13:47.340 --> 13:49.683
SO WE JUST WANTED
A PICTURE, YOU KNOW.

13:49.790 --> 13:50.472
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WAY
TO HONOR HIM.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.229
- THANKS.

13:52.340 --> 13:53.967
- AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
WE CAN DO, IF YOU WANT US...

13:54.070 --> 13:55.958
- THANK YOU.

13:56.070 --> 13:56.798

NO MORE CRYING.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.629
- OF COURSE.
- OKAY.

13:58.730 --> 14:01.415
BUT THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

14:01.530 --> 14:02.758
- I THINK IT'S
ACTUALLY A NICE JACKET.

14:02.870 --> 14:04.041
- AND IT FITS ME.
IT IS THE RIGHT...

14:04.150 --> 14:05.697
- IT'S LOOK GOOD.
- I'M HUNGRY. LET'S JUST ORDER.

14:05.810 --> 14:06.970
LET'S JUST ORDER.
- HADDIE, YOU KNOW,

14:07.080 --> 14:07.978
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
WE CAN EXCHANGE IT.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.354
- THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR GOING--

14:09.460 --> 14:10.700
- I'M JUST TELLING YOU.
- IT'S FINE, YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.186
- YOU KNOW, I JUST WANNA
GO BACK TO LOOK FOR GUACAMOLE.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.359
- WHY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO GUACAMOLE?

14:13.470 --> 14:14.562
- THIS IS WHY YOU
NEED TO GO SHOPPING.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.942
- HE WAS STOLEN.
- NOTHING HAPPENED TO GUACAMOLE.

14:16.060 --> 14:16.981
HE WAS NOT STOLEN.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:17.090 --> 14:17.772
- WELL, WHO WOULD
STEAL GUACAMOLE?

14:17.890 --> 14:18.982
- VICTOR.
- VICTOR?

14:19.090 --> 14:20.364
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
VICTOR WOULD NOT...

14:20.480 --> 14:21.640
- WHY DO THINK THAT
VICTOR STOLE GUACAMOLE?

14:21.750 --> 14:23.058
- STEAL GUACAMOLE,
SWEETH EART, OKAY?

14:23.170 --> 14:24.888
- OKAY, IT'S BECAUSE...
MOM CALLED US OUT FOR A SNACK.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.888
- I SAID THAT I LIKED IT,
LIKE, FIVE TIMES, MOM.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.376
- AND HE WAS UP THERE
ALONE WITH GUACAMOLE.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.651
- WHEN I GOT BACK UP,
MY LIZARD WAS GONE.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.829
- MOM.
- MAX!

14:30.930 --> 14:32.443
- WHOA, HEY!
- WHERE IS THAT WAITRESS?

14:32.560 --> 14:33.652
I'M STARVING.
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN, OKAY?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.000
[murmuring indistinctly,
baby crying]

14:35.110 --> 14:36.316
- HI.
- HEY.

14:36.420 --> 14:37.239
- CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED
WITH A DRINK?

14:37.350 --> 14:38.453
- UH, NO,
WE'RE READY O ORDER.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.188
AND WE'RE STARVING
BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY SLOW

14:41.290 --> 14:42.871
AND YOUR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.
- MAX, THAT'S NOT POLITE.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.254
- I WANT A TORPEDO BURGER
WITH NO ONIONS

14:44.360 --> 14:46.737
AND EXTRA, EXTRA, EXTRA BACON--
JUST TONS OF BACON.

14:46.850 --> 14:48.670
- I'M SO SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE
THE TORPEDO BURGER ANYMORE.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.748
- NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- UM, UH...

14:50.850 --> 14:52.397
- WHAT?

14:52.510 --> 14:54.023
- WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO LIKED THE TORPEDO BURGER

14:54.130 --> 14:55.950
LIKE THE SLIM MICKEY.
- I DON'T WANT...

14:56.060 --> 14:57.163
- OKAY.

14:57.270 --> 14:59.238
- CAN YOU...

14:59.340 --> 15:00.853
- LISTEN TO ME, WE'RE GONNA

15:00.960 --> 15:02.404
YOU HAVE A HOT DOG BUN, RIGHT?

15:02.520 --> 15:03.441
- IT'S NOT--IT DOESN'T MAKE--
YOU KNOW, I'M LEAVING.

15:03.550 --> 15:04.585
I'M MAKING A--
- WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

15:04.690 --> 15:05.759
- UH-UH-UH-UH.
MAX, SIT DOWN.

15:05.870 --> 15:07.269
- YOUR SISTER LEAVES
IN THREE DAYS--

15:07.380 --> 15:08.790
- GET OFF OF ME!
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

15:08.900 --> 15:09.889
- LET'S JUST GO THEN.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.272
YOU'RE NOT HELPING
MATTERS AT ALL.

15:11.390 --> 15:12.414
YOUR SISTER IS LEAVING
IN THREE DAYS.

15:12.530 --> 15:13.758
- CHILL OUT, OKAY?

15:13.870 --> 15:15.041
- WE'RE HERE TO CELEBRATE HER
BEFORE SHE LEAVES FOREVER.

15:15.150 --> 15:16.378
- I DON'T CARE.
- YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

15:16.500 --> 15:17.637
PLEASE TURN AROUND.
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAMILY, OKAY?

15:17.740 --> 15:19.628
- GUACAMOLE IS MISSING.
- YOU STOP TEXTING.

15:19.740 --> 15:20.775
- I'M NOT.
YOU AREN'T EVEN PAYING--

15:20.880 --> 15:25.567
- WE'RE HERE
TO CELEBRATE YOU.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.159
- FILL THE GAP--BETWEEN PURPLE
AND RED AND WHITE, THERE'S...

15:29.270 --> 15:30.646
- OKAY.
- SPACE IT UP, SPACE IT UP.

15:30.750 --> 15:31.921
- OKAY, BETWEEN HEATHER
AND TRISH AND JACKIE, YOU MEAN?

15:32.030 --> 15:33.884

15:34.000 --> 15:35.160

15:41.000 --> 15:42.069
GIVE ME THE 7200.
- OKAY.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.249
- THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS GOLDEN HOUR.

15:43.350 --> 15:44.248
HURRY UP.
- GOLDEN HOUR.

15:44.350 --> 15:45.487
WE ONLY HAVE ONE HOUR LEI-T.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.034
- NO, WE DON'T.
THAT'S AN EXPRESSION.

15:47.150 --> 15:48.071
WE GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
HURRY UP.

15:48.180 --> 15:48.692
- RIGHT.
NO, DUH.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.836
DUH.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.905
- THE CAMERA,
I NEED THE CAMERA, TOO!

15:52.020 --> 15:53.499
- RIGHT.
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.589
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
STAY RIGHT THERE, GUYS.

15:54.710 --> 15:55.734
THIS IS GOOD.

15:55.850 --> 15:56.919
ALL RIGHT.
WE NEED TO BOUNCE NOW.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.157
WE NEED BOUNCE, COME ON.
- THE ROUND THING?

15:58.260 --> 16:00.740
- YEAH, THE ROUND THING.
- OKAY, IT'S COMING.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.192
HERE YOU GO.
- GIVE ME THE CAMERA.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.221
- OKAY, YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE THAT?

16:03.340 --> 16:04.364
- GIVE ME THAT.
- OKAY.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.267
- ALL RIGHT.
WE NEED FILL, FILL, FILL.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.608
WE NEED FILL.
- GEORGE, HIS NAME IS GEORGE.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.235
- NO, WE--FILL, PUT IT THERE.

16:12.350 --> 16:15.274
- OKAY.
HERE IT COMES, YOU GUYS.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.894
- WHAT ARE YOU...
- I DON'T KNOW HOW IT--

16:18.010 --> 16:18.863
[shouts]
OH, MY GOD.

16:18.970 --> 16:23.907
OH, MY GOD.

16:24.010 --> 16:26.763
- THE SUN'S GONE.
- SORRY.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.041
I'M SO SORRY.
[sighs]

16:29.160 --> 16:32.323
- THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

16:36.650 --> 16:37.400
- GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

16:41.580 --> 16:44.299
- HE PRAYED A FEW TIMES.
IS THAT SO TERRIBLE?

16:44.410 --> 16:45.718
- HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SAID
THEY DRAGGED YOU TO CHURCH

16:45.830 --> 16:47.274
YOUR WHOLE CHILDHOOD AND NOW
YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN IT.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.962
- YEAH, I DON'T
BELIEVE IN CHURCH.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.753
THAT'S DIFFERENT
THAN BELIEVING IN GOD.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.559
- YEAH.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.799
IT WAS A BIG COMFORT TO ME
WHEN I WAS A KID.

16:57.910 --> 17:00.424
AND IT WASN'T
ABOUT GOD OR CHURCH.

17:00.530 --> 17:01.758
IT WAS ABOUT COMMUNITY.
- YEAH, I MEAN--

17:01.880 --> 17:04.428
YEAH, IT'S A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE
WITH THE SAME BELIEF.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.939
IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THAT BELIEF,

17:06.050 --> 17:07.460
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
A PART OF THAT COMMUNITY.

17:07.570 --> 17:08.844
AND I DON'T WANT MY SON
TO BE A PART OF SOME CLUB

17:08.950 --> 17:10.019
THAT I'M NOT A MEMBER OF.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.609
I MEAN, MAYBE THAT'S
SELFISH, BUT...

17:11.720 --> 17:14.609
- MAYBE A LITTLE.
- WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.334
- MM-HMM.
- BOOM! BOOM!

17:15.440 --> 17:18.682
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
- OH!

17:18.790 --> 17:19.996
- HI, MOM.
HI, DAD.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.204
- HERE'S THE LORD'S SOLDIER
RIGHT NOW.

17:22.310 --> 17:23.652
- [laughs, shouts]

17:23.760 --> 17:25.899
- HIS LIZARD IS MISSING?
- YEAH, HIS LIZARD IS MISSING.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.034
I--IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.210
IT PROBABLY JUST
GOT OUT OF ITS CAGE

17:29.320 --> 17:30.309
AND IT'S HIDING IN
A LAUNDRY BASKET OR SOMETHING.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.387
I HATE TO BE
BOTHERING YOU WITH THIS.

17:31.490 --> 17:32.832
- YOU DON'T THINK
THAT VICTOR...

17:32.940 --> 17:35.659
- NO, NO, NO.

17:35.770 --> 17:37.283
IT'S JUST WHEN THEY
HAD PLAYDATE TOGETHER,

17:37.400 --> 17:40.187
MAX SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, Al-TER
HE AND VICTOR WERE PLAYING,

17:40.300 --> 17:41.676
IT WAS MISSING.
I KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T TAKE IT.

17:41.780 --> 17:44.328
- WELL, I KNOW HOW MUCH
THOSE LIZARDS MEAN TO MAX.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.647
- LIKE I SAID,
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.503
IT'S JUST THE PLAYDATE TOGETHER,
IT'S MISSING. IT'S SILLY.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.885
BUT...LOOK, I'M EMBARRASSED TO
EVEN HAVE CALLED YOU, SO--

17:53.000 --> 17:56.163
- NO, NO.
KRISTINA, IT'S FINE.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.236
I WILL ASK VICTOR
IF HE KNOWS ANYTHING

17:58.350 --> 18:00.898
OR IF HE SAW IT
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

18:01.010 --> 18:04.559
- OKAY.
THANKS, JULES.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.219
- HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

18:11.330 --> 18:12.661
- HI, YEAH,
I'M LOOKING FOR NICK.

18:12.780 --> 18:13.849
- FOR NICK?

18:13.950 --> 18:16.464
- YEAH, I'M SURPRISING HIM
WITH THESE MUFFINS.

18:16.570 --> 18:20.199
IT'S OUR HALF-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.304
- WOW!
THAT'S GREAT.

18:24.410 --> 18:26.162
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU RIGHT TO HIM.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.204
COME WITH ME.
- GREAT.

18:28.310 --> 18:29.925
- SO MUFFINS, HUH?
- YEAH.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.271
- WOW, LUCKY GUY.

18:32.380 --> 18:35.065
HEY, NICK, LOOK WHO I FOUND.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.489
- CHELSEA, HI.
- HAPPY SIX-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

18:37.590 --> 18:38.796
- YAY.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

18:38.910 --> 18:39.934
- WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.109
- MM.
- WOW.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.666
- HEY, AMBER.
- ENJOY YOUR MUFFINS.

18:43.770 --> 18:45.635
- WOULD YOU RUN UP
TO THE HARDWARE STORE

18:45.740 --> 18:46.661
AND GRAB A PLUNGER?

18:46.780 --> 18:49.738
- LOOK, I'LL GO IN A MINUTE.
JUST...

18:49.850 --> 18:52.739
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:52.850 --> 18:55.432
- [sighs]
- UH-OH.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.717
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:04.830 --> 19:05.922
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

19:06.040 --> 19:07.200
WE SAID 10:00, RIGHT?

19:07.310 --> 19:08.652
- YOU'RE FIRED.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.556
- [scoffs]
WHAT?

19:09.660 --> 19:11.696
- YOU'RE FIRED.
YOU'RE FIRED.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.143
IT WASN'T OBVIOUS YOU
WERE FIRED YESTERDAY WITH...

19:14.250 --> 19:16.115
- HOW CAN I BE FIRED?
IT WAS ONE DAY.

19:16.220 --> 19:18.734
I MEAN, LOOK, OKAY.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.592
IT WASN'T PERFECT.
IT WAS MY FIRST DAY.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.564
I WAS NERVOUS.
I MIGHT HAVE, YOU KNOW,

19:22.670 --> 19:24.672
EXAGGERATED SLIGHTLY HOW MUCH
EXPERIENCE I HAVE, BUT...

19:24.780 --> 19:25.747
- NO, YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.
- NO, I DON'T HAVE NONE.

19:25.850 --> 19:27.294
- SO, DON'T EVEN--
DON'T EVEN SAY THAT.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.389
- HOLD ON. NO, NO, NO.
- NO, YOU HAVE NOTHING.

19:28.510 --> 19:29.192
- DON'T EVEN--NO, NO, NO.
- NO. STOP IT.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.744
NADA, OKAY?
YOU LIED.

19:30.850 --> 19:31.953
- I DIDN'T LIE COMPLETELY...
- YEAH, YOU BLATANTLY LIED...

19:32.060 --> 19:34.164
- UH, NO.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.544
- AND YOU RUINED MY BEST SHOT.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.094
- OH, NO, WHAT,
YOUR GOLDEN HOUR?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.542
YOU GOT A MILLION SHOTS OF THAT
FAMILY THAT WERE BEAUTIFUL.

19:39.660 --> 19:40.376
- HERE'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
- IF YOU DO NOT LET THAT GO...

19:40.480 --> 19:41.481
- SEE.
- WHAT?

19:41.590 --> 19:42.989
- YOU HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR LIGHT.

19:43.110 --> 19:44.338
- I DO HAVE
RESPECT FOR LIGHT.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.452
IT WAS ONE SHOT OUT OF,
LIKE, 300 GORGEOUS SHOTS.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.596
AND I MEAN, WHAT
DID YOU EXPECT, YOU KNOW,

19:48.700 --> 19:50.429
WITH YOUR ELABORATE
SCREENING PROCESS?

19:50.530 --> 19:51.622
LIKE, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW MY FIRST NAME.

19:51.740 --> 19:53.526
WHY DIDN'T--WHY DIDN'T YOU
FIRE ME YESTERDAY?

19:53.640 --> 19:57.087
- I NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO HELP ME LOAD THE VAN.

19:57.190 --> 19:59.772
- OH.

19:59.880 --> 20:04.294
- JUST--IT'S--THIS
IS NOT THE JOB FOR YOU,

20:04.410 --> 20:05.604
SO YOU'RE FIRED,
ALL RIGHT?

20:05.720 --> 20:08.268
- FINE.

20:08.370 --> 20:11.476
CAN I AT LEAST
GET MY DAY'S PAY?

20:16.870 --> 20:20.863
- WE EXPLORED OUR SPIRITUAL
SIDE BACK IN THE '605.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.619
- OH, OH, OKAY.
- YES.

20:22.730 --> 20:23.833
- GREAT. WHAT DID YOU--
WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:23.940 --> 20:28.422
- UM, WELL, I LIVED
AND WORKED ON A COMMUNE.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.282
- WOW!

20:30.400 --> 20:31.662
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

20:31.780 --> 20:35.364
- AND, UM, WE WERE
BUDDHISTS FOR A WHILE.

20:35.470 --> 20:37.199
WE JOINED THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.053
- [chuckles]
YOU WERE A BUDDHIST?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.811
- WHAT?
I CAN BE ZEN.

20:42.930 --> 20:45.854
- AND THERE WAS THAT
TANTRIC THING THAT WE DID.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.858
- OH, YEAH.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.609
- AI Y1 Y1.
MOM, LISTEN.

20:48.730 --> 20:51.301
HERE'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO GET AT.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.513
YOU KNOW, WHAT DID YOU--
WHAT DID YOU TAKE AWAY

20:53.630 --> 20:55.723
FROM OF ALL OF
THIS EXPERIMENTATION?

20:55.840 --> 20:58.286
- UM, WELL, I THINK
WE BOTH REALIZED

20:58.390 --> 21:01.109
THAT WE WERE MORE
INVESTED IN THIS WORLD

21:01.220 --> 21:03.666
AND THAT IF GOD
EXISTS AT ALL,

21:03.770 --> 21:07.183
HE'S RIGHT HERE IN OUR FAMILY.
YOU KNOW, IN THIS HOUSE.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.700
- OKAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE
DO YOU THINK WE GO WHEN WE DIE,

21:09.820 --> 21:12.641
OR, YOU KNOW,
WHAT STARTED LIFE?

21:12.750 --> 21:15.127
HOW DO YOU ANSWER
THOSE QUESTIONS?

21:15.230 --> 21:17.881
- I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.570
- AND EVEN IF I DID,
HOW WOULD THAT HELP YOU?

21:19.690 --> 21:22.989
ISN'T THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU
HAVE TO DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF?

21:27.590 --> 21:30.388
- HEY, COME ON. I MEAN,
JEEZ, WE GAVE YOU BASEBALL.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.665
- HM.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

21:37.050 --> 21:39.109
- BUT YOU KNOW, THINGS HAPPEN.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.700
SO IT'S FINE IF, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAPPENED TO TAKE IT

21:41.810 --> 21:43.493
AND THEN FORGET
TO PUT IT BACK IN THE CAGE.

21:43.610 --> 21:46.397
AND IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- YEAH, NOT A PROBLEM.

21:46.510 --> 21:49.149
WE JUST NEED TO KNOW.
- YEAH.

21:49.270 --> 21:50.817
IT'S FINE.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.238
- I DIDN'T TAKE
HIS STUPID LIZARD.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.717
- OKAY, GOOD.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.092
- WELL, THAT'S ALL
WE NEEDED TO KNOW.

21:56.210 --> 21:58.849
- GREAT. OKAY.

21:58.970 --> 22:02.724
VICTOR, I ALSO
JUST WANTED TO KNOW

22:02.830 --> 22:06.209
HOW IT'S GOING
FOR YOU HERE, OVERALL.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.767
- IT'S FINE.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.326
- GOOD. WELL, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

22:12.430 --> 22:14.182
YOU KNOW THAT
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

22:14.290 --> 22:16.224
RIGHT?
- YEAH.

22:16.330 --> 22:19.299
- ALL RIGHT.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.028
OKAY.

22:22.130 --> 22:23.472
- DID YOU KNOW THAT

22:23.580 --> 22:25.719
THOUSANDS OF FAMILY PETS
ARE REPORTED MISSING ANNUALLY,

22:25.820 --> 22:28.539
AND METROPOLITAN ZOOS
HAVE SEEN A RISE

22:28.650 --> 22:30.447
IN THEl-T ATTEMPTS
OF EXOTIC ANIMALS.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.371
- MAX, I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR STOLEN LIZARD.

22:33.490 --> 22:36.516
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, MAX...

22:36.630 --> 22:38.723
A LOT, ALL THE TIME.

22:38.840 --> 22:43.118
I'M GONNA MISS
HOW YOU'RE REALLY HONEST

22:43.220 --> 22:46.109
AND HOW YOU ALWAYS SAY EXACTLY
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS

22:46.220 --> 22:48.427
AND HOW YOU ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THINGS.

22:48.530 --> 22:51.328
IT'S A REALLY RARE QUALITY.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.842
I'M GONNA MISS IT.
- OKAY.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.403
- I GOT YOU A PRESENT.
- DID YOU?

22:58.510 --> 23:01.991
- OOH, NOW HE'S INTERESTED.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.783
_ - YUP!
[grunts]

23:03.890 --> 23:07.166
IT'S A WEIGHTED BLANKET.
- OH, GOODNESS.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.612
- I READ ABOUT IT ONLINE.

23:09.730 --> 23:11.038
UM, IT'S 25 POUNDS,
AND APPARENTLY,

23:11.140 --> 23:14.598
A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH ASPERGER'S
FIND THEM COMFORTING.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.907
SO...YOU WANNA TRY IT?
- SURE.

23:17.010 --> 23:19.763
- [grunts]

23:22.500 --> 23:24.809
[chuckles]

23:28.890 --> 23:30.539
- [sighs]

23:30.650 --> 23:33.289
- HOW'S IT FEEL?

23:33.410 --> 23:34.616
- GOOD.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.928
- GREAT.

23:38.030 --> 23:43.616
ALL RIGHT,
I WILL, UM, LEAVE YOU ALONE.

23:48.180 --> 23:49.932
I LOVE YOU, MAX.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.806
MAX, I SAID I LOVE YOU.

23:56.910 --> 23:58.912
- YEAH. THANKS.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.057
- HMM.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.263
- HEY.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.577
- HEY.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.784
- YOU WAITING UP

24:10.890 --> 24:11.709
- NO.

24:11.820 --> 24:14.687
- NO?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:14.790 --> 24:18.681
- I'M READING.
- MM-HMM.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.825
[sighs]
- I'M PATHETIC.

24:20.940 --> 24:21.861
I'M PATH ETIC.

24:21.970 --> 24:23.278
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M WAITING UP FOR HER.

24:23.390 --> 24:25.381
SHE'S GONNA COME HOME,
SHE'S GONNA SAY TWO WORDS TO ME,

24:25.490 --> 24:26.593
AND SHE'S GONNA GO UPSTAIRS.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.760
- WHY DON'T YOU
JUST COME TO BED, HUH?

24:29.880 --> 24:31.529
- I JUST HAD THE BEST WEEK
PLANNED FOR US, YOU KNOW.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.017
WE WERE GONNA DO
SO MANY FUN THINGS.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.564
WE WERE GONNA GO SHOPPING
TOGETHER, AND WE'D HANG OUT,

24:35.680 --> 24:37.841
AND WE'D GOSSIP, AND...

24:37.950 --> 24:40.054
JUST DIDN'T TURN OUT
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.958
IT WAS LIKE, SHE COULDN'T
FIT ME INTO HER SCHEDULE,

24:43.060 --> 24:44.436
SO IT'S LIKE...
- SHE WENT TO SEE HER FRIENDS.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.642
YOU GOT HER A GOOD COAT.
- I LIKE THE COAT.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.648
- A NICE, WARM COAT.
- IT IS A NICE WARM COAT.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.022
- IT'S GONNA BE COLD.

24:49.140 --> 24:50.892
- AND THE WHOLE THING AT
THE BURGER AND PIE INSTANT--

24:51.000 --> 24:52.035
THAT WHOLE THING
WAS A FIASCO.

24:52.140 --> 24:55.382
- YUP.
- WHO TAKES THAT OFF THE MENU?

24:55.490 --> 24:56.343
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A GOOD BURGER.

24:56.460 --> 24:59.554
- IT'S A GREAT BURGER.
- I KNOW.

24:59.670 --> 25:01.809
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.013
- SHE'S NEVER GONNA
LIVE HERE AGAIN.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.775
- YEAH.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.577
WELL, SHE'LL COME HOME
FOR HOLIDAYS.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.126
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.686
- YEAH.

25:26.110 --> 25:28.863
- YOU WANNA GET DRUNK?

25:32.080 --> 25:33.388

25:33.490 --> 25:35.310

DUMP IT DOWN.

25:35.430 --> 25:36.522

26:05.770 --> 26:08.147

DID SHE SAY WHY?

26:08.250 --> 26:12.038
- NO, IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO REACH HER OUT THERE.

26:12.150 --> 26:13.139
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

26:13.260 --> 26:14.830
SHE SEEMS KIND OF, LIKE,
DISTANT OR SOMETHING.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.089
WELL, GRANDSON,

26:17.190 --> 26:19.158
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.
[blender grinding]

26:19.260 --> 26:21.637
I'VE SEEN THE WAY
THAT GIRL LOOKS AT YOU.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.604
SHE LOVES TO BE AROUND YOU.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.608

AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.267

26:27.370 --> 26:30.954

26:48.260 --> 26:50.842
I GUESS I SHOULD'VE LISTENED

26:50.950 --> 26:54.431
SO GIVE ME ONE MORE DAY

26:54.540 --> 26:56.394
GIVE ME ONE MORE NIGHT

26:56.510 --> 27:00.856
TODAY'S OUR DAY

27:00.960 --> 27:03.781
LET'S FORGET ABOUT
EVERYONE ELSE

27:03.890 --> 27:07.235
AND EVERYTHING ELSE

27:11.000 --> 27:13.241
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
WHAT A PRICK THIS GUY IS?

27:13.350 --> 27:14.419
- YEAH, HE'S THE WORST.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.761

27:16.870 --> 27:18.974
IT TURNS OUT HE'S GOT
A SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND.

ACTS LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.
REAL CASANOVA, RIGHT?

27:21.220 --> 27:23.836
- RIGHT.
- WHO PULLS CRAP LIKE THAT?

27:23.950 --> 27:25.565

27:25.670 --> 27:28.150
- EVEN ONES YOU WOULDN'T THINK,
LIKE KENNY G AND STUFF.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.363

27:31.710 --> 27:33.814

27:33.920 --> 27:35.091
- YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.
- YOU WANT THEM OUT?

27:35.200 --> 27:36.542
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU ABOUT AMBER.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.857
SHE'S 20 YEARS OLD.
SHE'S AN ADULT.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.780
YOU CAN'T GET INVOLVED
LIKE THIS.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.208
- SO WHAT? SO, WHAT,
ARE WE GONNA JUST SIT BACK

27:42.310 --> 27:43.538
AND LET SOMEBODY
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER

27:43.660 --> 27:44.547
WITHOUT DOING
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

27:44.660 --> 27:45.558
I DON'T THINK SO.
- YES.

27:45.660 --> 27:46.581
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT.

27:46.690 --> 27:47.793
HEY, GUYS, EXCUSE ME.

27:47.900 --> 27:48.889
I WANT YOU...
- HE'S A PAYING CUSTOMER.

27:49.010 --> 27:50.659
- TO PACK IT UP
AND GET OUT.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.794
- WHAT?
- WE'RE DONE HERE.

27:51.910 --> 27:53.070
WE ARE DONE.
- YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

27:53.180 --> 27:54.351
YOU KNOW WHAT--

27:54.460 --> 27:56.496

28:04.640 --> 28:05.777
- ADAM!
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

28:05.890 --> 28:07.050
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LISTEN TO HIM.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.401
- HEY!
- HOW IS SHE GONNA LEARN

28:09.510 --> 28:10.545
A LESSON IF
YOU THROW HIM OUT?

28:10.650 --> 28:13.949
- YOU DON'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER, ALL RIGHT?

28:27.670 --> 28:28.739
- HEY, MARK.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.048
- HI.
- YOU KNOW, SARAH'S NOT HERE.

28:32.150 --> 28:33.356
- I-I KNOW.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.495
I ACT UALLY--I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU.

28:35.610 --> 28:36.702
- OH. WHAT'S UP?

28:36.810 --> 28:40.985
- WELL, CAMILLE...

28:41.090 --> 28:45.811
SARAH AND I ARE ENGAGED,
AS YOU KNOW,

28:45.930 --> 28:47.158
AND I THINK I...
SHOULD BE

28:47.270 --> 28:51.400
IN THE FAMILY PORTRAIT
WITH YOU GUYS.

28:51.520 --> 28:55.138
- OH, MARK,
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.820
AND WE ALL THINK
YOU'RE WONDERFUL, WE REALLY DO.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.271
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,

28:58.390 --> 29:01.382
SOMETIMES LIFE DOESN'T WORK OUT
THE WAY WE EXPECT IT TO.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.004
- 'CAUSE I-I KNOW THAT I DON'T
HAVE A RING YET, OR...

29:04.120 --> 29:06.281
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RING.

29:06.390 --> 29:08.119
- WELL, AND I KNOW
THAT WE HAVEN'T SET A--

29:08.220 --> 29:10.290
UM, HEY, ZEEK.
- HEY, MARK.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.812
- I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
SET A WEDDING DATE YET,

29:12.920 --> 29:14.888
BUT DREW IS GRADUATING
THIS YEAR AND WE DIDN'T WANT

29:14.990 --> 29:16.298
TO RUSH INTO IT
UNTIL--BEFORE THAT.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.642
- WELL, RIGHT.
- BUT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

29:19.750 --> 29:22.617
HELLO.
- HI.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.823
- YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.852
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.

29:25.970 --> 29:29.519
AND I RESPECT FAMILY POLICY,

29:29.620 --> 29:33.033
BUT I-I AM A PART
OF YOUR FAMILY.

29:33.150 --> 29:37.280
AND I'M PROUD TO BE
A PART OF YOUR FAMILY.

29:37.390 --> 29:40.188
I GUESS I WANT YOU
TO BE PROUD OF IT, TOO.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.529
- MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MAX, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

29:45.640 --> 29:47.676
MAX! MAX!

29:47.780 --> 29:48.815
DO NOT TOUCH MY STUFF.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.126
- I'M LOOKING FOR GUACAMOLE.
- STOP!

29:50.230 --> 29:51.606
I HAVE TO PACK THIS UP AGAIN.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.709
THIS IS MY STUFF.
- HEY, HEY.

29:52.820 --> 29:54.094
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

29:54.200 --> 29:55.189
- I'M TRYING TO FIND
ALL THE POSSIBLE...

29:55.310 --> 29:56.334
- MAX IS LOOKING
FOR HIS STUPID LIZARD.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.850
LOOK AT MY ROOM.
- I'LL MAKE MORE LATER.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.302
- HE LOST HIS LIZARD, OKAY.
THIS CAN BE REPACKED.

29:59.410 --> 30:01.207
JUST--I'LL TALK TO HIM.
- OH, GREAT.

30:01.310 --> 30:02.208
I'M SURE THAT
THAT'S REALLY GONNA HELP.

30:02.310 --> 30:03.299
DON'T, IT'S FINE.
- HEY, HADDIE,

30:03.420 --> 30:05.240
JUST TAKE A BREATH.
- I'M PACKING UP.

30:05.350 --> 30:06.658
- NO, IT'S FINE.
- LOSE THE ATTITUDE, OKAY?

30:06.770 --> 30:07.896
- YOU'RE OVERREACTING.
- DON'T--STOP.

30:08.010 --> 30:09.238
STOP. STOP!
I'LL CLEAN IT WHEN I GET BACK.

30:09.350 --> 30:10.931
- WELL, WHERE EXACTLY
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

30:11.050 --> 30:12.836
LOOK, YOUR GRANDPARENTS
ARE TH ROWING

30:12.940 --> 30:14.760
A GOING AWAY PARTY FOR YOU,
OKAY? GET BACK HERE.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.279
- THIS ENTIRE PARTY
IS FOR YOU, OKAY?

30:16.400 --> 30:17.731
- YOU'VE KNOWN
ABOUT IT ALL WEEK.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.566
- YOU DON'T JUST WALTZ IN
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

30:18.670 --> 30:20.638
- THIS PARTY IS NOT FOR ME.

30:20.740 --> 30:22.321
NONE OF THIS WEEK
HAS BEEN FOR ME.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.748
I NEED TO GET OUT
AND HAVE A SECOND OF SPACE.

30:23.850 --> 30:25.909
- TAKE A BREATH.

30:26.030 --> 30:27.292
WE'LL REPACK ALL
THIS TOGETHER, OKAY?

30:27.410 --> 30:28.672
- FINE, DON'T COME AT ALL.
DON'T SHOW UP AT ALL.

30:28.790 --> 30:29.996
- COME ON, HONEY. HONEY.
- GREAT, I WON'T!

30:30.100 --> 30:32.261
AND BY THE WAY,
I HAD MY BONDING TIME WITH MAX

30:32.380 --> 30:34.473
AND IT WENT REALLY GREAT,
AND WE'RE CLOSER THAN EVER,

30:34.590 --> 30:37.343
AND HE'S TOTALLY NORMAL.

30:47.530 --> 30:49.350
- [sighs]
HI.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.143
- HI.

30:51.260 --> 30:54.297
- I'M SAYING HI, YOU KNOW,
SO IT'S NOT TOO AWKWARD.

30:54.400 --> 30:59.645
- UM, MIGHT BE
A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.

30:59.750 --> 31:00.717
- WE'LL JUST GET A LITTLE BIT
MORE, JUST RIGHT ON TOP HERE.

31:00.820 --> 31:06.019
- MY HAIR IS FINE.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.643
- WELL...
[clears throat]

31:08.760 --> 31:10.307
- BOYS.
- YEAH.

31:10.420 --> 31:14.060
HERE, I'LL TAKE THIS
OUT FOR YOU.

31:14.180 --> 31:16.148
- SHE BETTER SHOW UP.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.319
- SHE BETTER SHOW Al-TER
WE MADE ALL THESE CUPCAKES.

31:17.420 --> 31:18.455
- THIS PARTY IS FOR HER,
AND EVERYBODY CAME...

31:18.560 --> 31:20.733
- HEY, HOW DID YOU
HANDLE THE GOD TOPIC WITH

31:20.840 --> 31:22.728
AMBER AND DREW?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.899
- WHICH GOD TOPIC?

31:25.020 --> 31:26.328
- WELL, WE WERE RAISED
IN A SPIRITUAL VACUUM,

31:26.430 --> 31:27.704
SO WHAT DID YOU PASS ON
TO YOUR KIDS?

31:27.810 --> 31:29.675
- OH, CROSBY,
COME ON, LET IT GO.

31:29.780 --> 31:30.678
HEY.
- HEY.

31:30.780 --> 31:32.008
- HOW DID YOU GET IN?

31:32.130 --> 31:32.812
- I KNOCKED AND I RANG,
BUT I DIDN'T THINK...

31:32.920 --> 31:34.808
- WHAT IS THIS?

31:34.920 --> 31:36.740
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- WHAT?

31:36.860 --> 31:38.430
- I HAD TO WAIT EIGHT YEARS
TO GET IN THE FAMILY PICTURE.

31:38.550 --> 31:40.950
- YEAH, I HAD TO MARRY
HIS ASS TO GET IN.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.332
- SHE MADE US WAIT UNTIL
OUR TH REE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

31:42.450 --> 31:44.589
- HE FOUND A LOOPHOLE!
- THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

31:44.690 --> 31:46.419
- YOU GUYS EXAGGERATE
SO BAD.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.865
- WHO'S THAT GUY?
- AUNT SARAH'S FIANCE.

31:49.970 --> 31:54.418
- HUH.

31:54.530 --> 31:54.905
WHAT IS HE, 6?

31:55.010 --> 31:57.319
- HE IS 29.

31:57.430 --> 32:00.422
- YEAH, THAT'S
A LITTLE DARK, MARK.

32:00.530 --> 32:01.667
- YOU'RE A LITTLE WEIRD.

32:01.780 --> 32:04.396
- YEP.
- I LIKE YOU.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.946
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I LIKE YOU YET.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.779
[indistinct chatter]

32:09.890 --> 32:12.404
- MAYBE SOME BLACK OVER HERE.

32:12.510 --> 32:14.478
- HEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND, OUTSIDE?

32:14.580 --> 32:16.229
- UH, YEAH.

32:16.340 --> 32:19.309
- A RICH, FULL BLUE.
- BUT HIS IS...

32:19.420 --> 32:21.752
- A NAW BLUE.

32:21.870 --> 32:23.007
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST...

32:23.110 --> 32:25.624
- WHAT'S UlIJFl GO AHEAD.

32:25.730 --> 32:27.971
UM, DID YOU TELL THE BAND

32:28.080 --> 32:29.217
THAT THEY COULDN'T RECORD
AT THE STUDIO ANYMORE?

32:29.320 --> 32:30.764
- YEAH.

32:30.870 --> 32:32.007
LOOK, I DIDN'T THINK
THAT NICK BEHAVED

32:32.120 --> 32:35.351
IN AN HONORABLE FASHION, OKAY?

32:35.470 --> 32:37.188
- OKAY, SERGEANT.
I APPRECIATE IT.

32:37.300 --> 32:38.915
BUT WE ARE AT
A RECORDING STUDIO.

32:39.020 --> 32:39.918
- YUP!
- IT'S ROCK AND ROLL.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.248
IT'S...
- I UNDERSTAND IT--

32:41.370 --> 32:42.507
LISTEN, AMBER,
IT WAS MY DECISION,

32:42.610 --> 32:43.463
AND I'M NOT GONNA STAND BY

32:43.580 --> 32:44.672
AND LET SOMEBODY
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

32:44.790 --> 32:46.644
OKAY?
- OKAY.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.401
UH, THAT'S NOBLE, BUT I WASN'T
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

32:49.510 --> 32:52.138
I WAS A WILLING PARTICIPANT,
VERY WILLING, OKAY.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.038
AND I'M SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T
JUMP INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.300
- THAT GUY WAS A JERK!

32:56.420 --> 32:58.888
- REGARDLESS IF WHETHER
HE WAS A JERK, I'M FINE.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.410
AND YOU THREW AWAY GOOD BUSINESS
FOR NO REASON...

33:01.530 --> 33:02.212
- IT'S NOT ABOUT BUSINESS.
- BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY FINE.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.242
WELL, IT SHOULD BE.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.907
IT'S GOTTA BE,
BECAUSE I'M YOUR EMPLOYEE NOW.

33:06.010 --> 33:07.659
AND YOU HAVE TO START TREATING
ME AS AN ADULT, BECAUSE I AM.

33:07.770 --> 33:11.558
- [sighs]

33:11.670 --> 33:15.128
I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

33:15.230 --> 33:18.154
I CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULD--

33:18.270 --> 33:19.294
