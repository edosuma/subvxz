00:00.703 --> 00:03.358
<i>Mother called in.
Reported him missing at 6 A.M.</i>

00:03.383 --> 00:05.968
<i>We found a jean jacket,
a cell and a bike,</i>

00:05.984 --> 00:07.750
<i>all confirmed by Maggie Sweetland</i>

00:07.786 --> 00:10.887
<i>to belong to her 16-year-old son, Jesse.</i>

00:10.922 --> 00:13.823
He's our most ridiculously
talented hockey player.

00:13.858 --> 00:15.959
And he's into the make-up and the...

00:15.994 --> 00:18.160
Yes. Rumor has it he's contemplating

00:18.196 --> 00:19.361
his gender identity.

00:19.397 --> 00:21.363
Remember those riddles
I got when I was young?

00:21.399 --> 00:22.642
<i>They messed you up really bad.</i>

00:22.667 --> 00:24.018
<i>Did you ever get
a lead on who sent them</i>

00:24.042 --> 00:25.143
<i>that you never told me about?</i>

00:25.167 --> 00:27.571
<i>- It's from the Nativity Scene.
- Jesse religious?</i>

00:27.596 --> 00:28.860
<i>Maybe caught in the middle.</i>

00:28.885 --> 00:30.462
Daisy, it's Mom! Open up!

00:30.487 --> 00:32.019
- Who was he?!
- Who?

00:32.043 --> 00:34.477
- The man!
- There's no one here, baby.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.181 --> 00:49.202
It was here.

01:05.621 --> 01:07.359
Look.

01:10.658 --> 01:12.342
What am I looking at? Graffiti?

01:12.367 --> 01:13.692
He did both of them.

01:13.727 --> 01:15.959
This painting and the scene earlier.

01:15.984 --> 01:17.828
He?

01:17.853 --> 01:19.175
He's back.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.866
Who's back?

01:20.901 --> 01:22.928
The asshole who sent me riddles.

01:22.953 --> 01:24.302
Why would you say that?

01:24.338 --> 01:26.409
Pedophile, Sid, gave me a note

01:26.434 --> 01:29.685
with the exact same riddle
I couldn't solve as a kid.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.376
It led me here.

01:32.028 --> 01:33.545
Jesus, Annie.

01:33.581 --> 01:36.782
Had to see if there's anything
to it before I told you.

01:37.426 --> 01:39.620
You sure it's the same guy?

01:45.225 --> 01:46.691
Annie.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.121
There is something else.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.973
He did this while Daisy in the car?

02:11.002 --> 02:12.501
Yeah.

02:12.536 --> 02:14.269
I'll kill him.

02:14.305 --> 02:16.296
Gimme your phone.

02:19.410 --> 02:21.009
Nobody's looking at these,

02:21.044 --> 02:22.905
and getting conversion therapy, okay?

02:22.930 --> 02:24.212
Even you're not.

02:24.247 --> 02:25.514
You got it from the evidence.

02:25.549 --> 02:27.068
You got it from the, from the porn,

02:27.093 --> 02:28.444
and from the fence, or from the scar.

02:28.468 --> 02:30.757
- It has nothing to do with Jesse.
- But why is he doing it?

02:30.781 --> 02:32.552
Because he's psycho!

02:32.689 --> 02:35.256
When you were eight years
old, he messed you up so bad,

02:35.292 --> 02:37.103
that you stopped eating
until the fucking bones

02:37.127 --> 02:39.894
came through your fucking
face. Do you remember that?

02:39.930 --> 02:42.452
Just 'cause he's a nut job doesn't
mean he doesn't know about Jesse.

02:42.476 --> 02:44.710
You tell anyone about this,
they're gonna think we're nuts.

02:44.734 --> 02:47.278
I will find him. You
stay away from this.

02:47.303 --> 02:49.193
- Do you understand?
- Fine.

03:13.721 --> 03:15.009
Daisy.

03:23.171 --> 03:24.738
She won't even talk to me.

03:25.009 --> 03:27.885
What happened last night?
She said you two had a fight?

03:28.705 --> 03:31.173
She's never not talked to me before.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.613
Give her space. She'll come around.

03:33.790 --> 03:36.157
You sure it was just a
fight? Felt like more.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.251
Anything I need to
be worried about here?

03:38.286 --> 03:39.739
Either of you?

03:40.488 --> 03:42.332
You getting any sleep?

03:44.348 --> 03:46.090
I gotta work.

03:54.403 --> 03:56.675
- Anything from the prints?
- No.

03:59.363 --> 04:02.395
Did you get a trace on whoever
called dispatch about Driver.

04:02.722 --> 04:03.900
Already on it.

04:03.925 --> 04:05.927
I'm just saying, that even if
you call from a public place

04:05.951 --> 04:07.708
and we don't get anything,
we can get a pattern.

04:07.732 --> 04:09.761
I got it, Annie. Alright?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.252
I'm pretty sure he watches me.

04:17.289 --> 04:20.151
Well then, I'll have a uniform
drive by your house every few hours.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.076
Didn't work before.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.811
I've been looking into
conversion therapy.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.403
It ranges from talk
therapy to electric shocks

04:32.439 --> 04:33.927
while showing the
patient images of things

04:33.951 --> 04:35.692
they should hate themselves for wanting.

04:35.717 --> 04:37.473
But what's the blood on the jacket?

04:37.498 --> 04:39.465
We're talking about a
bunch of sadistic amateurs.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.979
I'm guessing they wanted the basics,

04:42.004 --> 04:43.279
and made up their own rules.

04:43.352 --> 04:45.119
He had the scar for a few days.

04:45.144 --> 04:46.910
So maybe it's an ongoing thing.

04:46.935 --> 04:48.598
So he was doing it
without going missing.

04:48.623 --> 04:50.356
Why is this night different?

04:50.381 --> 04:53.082
Maybe it got outta hand, he fought back.

04:53.292 --> 04:54.971
We know he showed up in a dress.

04:54.996 --> 04:56.896
That would piss people off.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.831
He's... 5'10?

05:01.166 --> 05:05.138
Hey, Martin. Probably looking
within this range, okay?

05:05.571 --> 05:07.161
He rode his bike here.

05:07.186 --> 05:08.841
It's not like he was dragged.

05:10.709 --> 05:12.319
Can't knock this one out
of the park yet, Ryder?

05:12.343 --> 05:13.794
Children.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.212
Found something.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.571
Looks like skin.

05:28.858 --> 05:30.499
I'm gonna go talk to Maggie.

05:41.846 --> 05:43.331
Are you sick?

05:43.356 --> 05:44.634
Stay away.

05:44.659 --> 05:46.324
You need to do a lot
more than stand next to me

05:46.348 --> 05:47.823
to get what I got.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.777
Why are you proud of that?

06:01.691 --> 06:03.168
Sure you wanna be here?

06:03.193 --> 06:05.326
I wanna see people.

06:05.361 --> 06:07.590
I want to look in their eyes.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.511
I've been thinking about
the scar on Jesse's hand.

06:12.536 --> 06:14.348
There's some people, religious people,

06:14.373 --> 06:15.730
who believe there are ways to convert...

06:15.754 --> 06:17.620
He's a drama queen.

06:17.655 --> 06:19.138
He's still gonna make it to
the first game of the season.

06:19.162 --> 06:20.356
He'll show up.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.937
Yeah, in a tutu.

06:24.328 --> 06:25.871
Idiots.

06:26.430 --> 06:29.930
How can you know that what's
inside a person isn't pure evil?

06:29.955 --> 06:31.547
You can't.

06:31.773 --> 06:34.569
Evil looks just like you and me.

06:34.605 --> 06:37.554
Maggie. Did somebody talk to
you about converting Jesse?

06:38.390 --> 06:39.641
I'm not judging.

06:39.676 --> 06:41.543
I'm just trying to put together pieces.

06:41.578 --> 06:43.115
If this was going on it could help us...

06:43.139 --> 06:44.646
Going on?

06:44.671 --> 06:46.030
No.

06:46.055 --> 06:47.683
This wasn't going on.

06:47.718 --> 06:49.989
- Okay. I needed to ask.
- Dear Lord.

06:50.014 --> 06:52.454
Please give us grace and patience

06:52.489 --> 06:54.208
in this time of crisis.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.224
And give us guidance, Lord,

06:56.259 --> 06:58.496
that we may find young Jesse...

06:58.521 --> 07:00.691
I told him 'no'.

07:00.930 --> 07:03.331
What did you do with my kid?

07:04.790 --> 07:06.055
Where is he?!

07:06.080 --> 07:07.758
Where is he?!

07:10.446 --> 07:11.978
Where is he?!

07:19.658 --> 07:21.641
Thank you, Detective.

07:23.907 --> 07:27.175
So yesterday, when I asked
you if you knew Jesse,

07:27.210 --> 07:28.610
you said no.

07:28.635 --> 07:31.823
I said no, he didn't have a
relationship with the church,

07:31.848 --> 07:34.344
- try as we might.
- Semantics?

07:34.517 --> 07:36.258
A kid's missing.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.268
What did you talk to
Maggie about, Father?

07:39.293 --> 07:41.493
It was a kind of talk therapy

07:41.518 --> 07:44.901
that focuses on
reorientation and healing.

07:45.283 --> 07:46.682
Healing?

07:46.707 --> 07:48.026
So he's sick?

07:48.051 --> 07:50.329
Does your congregation know
that you feel he's sick?

07:50.354 --> 07:52.484
It's no secret that
the church doesn't agree

07:52.509 --> 07:54.912
with the path Jesse was heading towards.

07:54.937 --> 07:56.274
I went to see Maggie.

07:56.290 --> 07:59.829
Sat with her in her living
room, it was very respectful.

08:00.003 --> 08:01.570
And she said no.

08:01.605 --> 08:03.569
And that's the last it was spoken of?

08:03.594 --> 08:04.639
Yeah.

08:04.675 --> 08:05.841
We have reason to believe

08:05.876 --> 08:08.142
that someone may have
carried out a violent form

08:08.178 --> 08:10.178
of conversion therapy on Jesse.

08:10.213 --> 08:11.746
And you think I...

08:11.782 --> 08:14.148
I think that they might have
gotten the idea from you.

08:14.184 --> 08:15.912
One of your flock.

08:16.152 --> 08:18.386
Took measures into their own hands.

08:18.421 --> 08:20.670
God is love.

08:21.373 --> 08:23.373
People here know that.

08:24.473 --> 08:26.942
If there's nothing further,
I have to get back...

08:26.967 --> 08:28.978
Of course.

08:30.950 --> 08:33.200
Stellar questioning on your part.

08:33.731 --> 08:37.288
It sounded like he wanted to
read to Jesse from the bible.

08:37.313 --> 08:39.270
It's Father J, Annie.

08:39.296 --> 08:40.825
You serious?

08:45.724 --> 08:47.991
It doesn't inspire
confidence, a scene like that.

08:48.016 --> 08:51.084
- Sorry?
- People respect Father as a leader.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.487
We need that stability right now.

08:53.522 --> 08:55.755
Jameson is convinced that Jesse's sick.

08:55.790 --> 08:57.624
There are all kinds
of illnesses out there.

08:57.659 --> 09:00.430
Not all of 'em strip the
color from your cheeks.

09:00.455 --> 09:02.239
I wish I had as much certainty on lunch

09:02.264 --> 09:04.864
as your mom does on the big questions.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.166
- I'm gonna be late.
- Teenagers.

09:07.191 --> 09:09.435
She watches one French
film and it's all Paris.

09:09.470 --> 09:12.078
No it's not! I have to go.

09:12.103 --> 09:13.417
You're lucky you've got a bit more time

09:13.441 --> 09:15.205
before Daisy gets her period.

09:29.719 --> 09:32.491
Man. This place.

09:32.527 --> 09:34.821
Memories. Am I right?

09:35.159 --> 09:36.929
The whole world was yours.

09:36.964 --> 09:39.431
- You played too right?
- Yeah.

09:39.790 --> 09:41.667
Is that why you never got married?

09:41.964 --> 09:44.970
Taste of the hockey life
and one woman can't cut it?

09:45.005 --> 09:46.872
Cops don't do so bad, Brady.

09:46.907 --> 09:49.675
Yeah? Gimme some details.

09:49.831 --> 09:52.343
I'm not gonna give you any details.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.546
When are you gonna let me in, man?

09:54.582 --> 09:56.281
I mean, I've never
even been to your house.

09:56.316 --> 09:58.550
You could have a woman
in a cage for all I know.

09:58.585 --> 10:00.351
You're never coming to my house, Brady.

10:00.387 --> 10:02.815
Boys, sorry for the wait.

10:03.513 --> 10:05.623
- Any news?
- Not yet.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.227
So Brady tells me there's
been a few dust-ups

10:08.252 --> 10:10.158
with Jesse and the boys? Is that true?

10:10.183 --> 10:12.296
Whaddya want me to
say? It wasn't an issue?

10:12.331 --> 10:15.332
Come on. I got this phenom-kid,

10:15.367 --> 10:17.868
you know, OHL scouts
freaking out over him,

10:17.904 --> 10:20.771
and the woman stuff starts.

10:20.807 --> 10:22.381
Didn't make things easy.

10:22.406 --> 10:24.908
But end of the day we
don't win without him.

10:25.014 --> 10:27.745
You know, the boys aren't dumb
enough to incapacitate him.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.914
You never
noticed a scar on his hand?

10:30.949 --> 10:33.417
He ever complain about
anyone giving him a hard time?

10:33.452 --> 10:35.552
I don't mean kids making fun.

10:35.588 --> 10:37.921
I mean, anyone wanting him to stop,

10:37.956 --> 10:39.824
threatening him around his femininity?

10:39.849 --> 10:41.456
Maybe someone religious?

10:41.481 --> 10:44.127
You should check the
Rez. He hung out there.

10:44.152 --> 10:46.777
Why didn't you say that when
the cops talked to you yesterday?

10:46.802 --> 10:49.065
Honestly, cops are kind of abrasive.

10:49.101 --> 10:50.929
It's hard to think properly.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.966
You? Anyone try to convert him?

10:54.991 --> 10:56.711
I definitely think you
should check the Rez.

10:56.742 --> 10:59.224
Don't native people like wear dresses

10:59.249 --> 11:00.744
and dance around a fire?

11:00.779 --> 11:02.678
Yeah, and every year we sacrifice

11:02.713 --> 11:04.600
a privileged white girl.

11:07.954 --> 11:09.587
I'm going to the Rez.

11:09.991 --> 11:12.194
You can't come. They won't talk to you.

11:13.095 --> 11:14.429
Annie.

11:16.082 --> 11:18.149
Jesse's a great kid.

11:18.346 --> 11:19.895
I'm his supply teacher.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.596
We talked a few times.

11:21.632 --> 11:23.098
You ever talk about gender?

11:23.134 --> 11:25.367
A little. In a vague way.

11:25.402 --> 11:28.029
He didn't seem ready to
talk about it directly.

11:28.054 --> 11:31.326
What about in self reference.
Does Jesse go by she?

11:31.351 --> 11:33.008
Not that I know of.

11:33.044 --> 11:36.010
I think Jesse is still
figuring it all out.

11:41.237 --> 11:43.051
You have visitors. Quiet down.

11:43.086 --> 11:45.554
Hey, Cook. What are you five? Come on.

11:46.938 --> 11:48.561
Fuck off, man.

11:49.061 --> 11:50.858
So what's up with him?

11:51.483 --> 11:54.420
Well, I got Jacob centering
the number one line in Jesse's place.

11:54.445 --> 11:56.831
You know, think he's
feeling the pressure.

11:57.405 --> 11:59.901
Hey, Jacob? You gonna
step up tonight, man?

11:59.936 --> 12:01.969
Sir. Yes, sir!

12:02.005 --> 12:03.705
Twenty-five.

12:03.730 --> 12:05.127
Yeah. Listen up, boys.

12:05.152 --> 12:08.075
Officers Holt and Welland got
some questions for you here.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.439
Give 'em trouble and you're
drinkin' from the toilet.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.478
You got it?

12:11.503 --> 12:13.369
Who here goes to church?

12:20.155 --> 12:23.524
Hey. What're you doin'
slummin' on the Rez?

12:23.559 --> 12:27.418
You're one to talk,
always in Florida. Lucky.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.772
You guys ever see that kid
Jesse Sweetland, up around here?

12:31.797 --> 12:33.633
Yeah, here and there.

12:33.668 --> 12:35.969
But I can tell you who
you need to talk to.

12:36.294 --> 12:38.011
Al, thanks for
getting back to me.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.059
Listen. I got an odd question for you.

12:40.084 --> 12:41.904
Um, when you were prosecutor,

12:41.929 --> 12:45.431
you handled a lot of
Clarence Ryder's cases?

12:46.178 --> 12:49.404
Hmh. Was there anyone that
had a special hate on for him?

12:49.429 --> 12:52.553
Someone that you put away, and
then maybe got out this year?

12:53.839 --> 12:55.295
<i>I don't know. Likes to play games.</i>

12:55.320 --> 12:57.653
<i>Sick mind. That sort of thing.</i>

13:29.989 --> 13:31.263
Jesse?

13:35.567 --> 13:37.528
Um, I was praying.

13:37.563 --> 13:39.998
Seems like you were
looking for something.

13:42.497 --> 13:44.308
You were here that night.

13:44.637 --> 13:46.904
You can't talk to me without consent.

13:46.939 --> 13:49.173
I can have your badge.

14:25.481 --> 14:26.947
Maggie?

14:30.876 --> 14:32.579
I told you...

14:33.368 --> 14:34.965
I didn't do...

14:34.990 --> 14:36.962
Cops said you didn't do anything.

14:39.702 --> 14:42.506
You know, I didn't realize
until you came to my house,

14:42.531 --> 14:44.620
that it was who he was.

14:45.675 --> 14:49.534
A phase, a rebellion.

14:51.909 --> 14:53.609
And you come to my house

14:53.634 --> 14:55.972
and you say you can fix him.

14:57.312 --> 14:59.722
And I see his face.

15:00.014 --> 15:01.597
And I know.

15:02.161 --> 15:03.917
It's who he is.

15:35.549 --> 15:37.827
When you put on your dress...

15:39.124 --> 15:41.863
I thought it was a phase too.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.698
Hey punk.

16:07.723 --> 16:09.131
Daddy!

16:09.449 --> 16:11.909
Did you fight any giants at work today?

16:11.934 --> 16:13.834
Yeah.

16:14.447 --> 16:16.673
But they were only midget giants.

16:16.698 --> 16:17.970
You know what,

16:18.988 --> 16:21.173
they wanted you to have this.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.494
Pretty?

16:22.519 --> 16:24.486
Apparently she's got some special powers

16:24.511 --> 16:26.311
to protect you when I'm not with you.

16:26.336 --> 16:28.285
I said no, she doesn't need that.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.227
She could protect herself.

16:32.245 --> 16:34.686
"If she tells she
never learns the truth..."

16:34.711 --> 16:36.423
"about either."

16:36.860 --> 16:40.575
Sandy Driver was killed and
dressed as the Virgin Mary.

16:40.994 --> 16:43.732
He dressed my doll as Mary.

16:45.619 --> 16:47.019
Sandy and Jesse.

16:47.044 --> 16:49.810
Is there a connection
between Sandy and Jesse?

16:52.263 --> 16:55.834
Hey. You wanna learn
how to fight giants?

16:56.332 --> 16:58.276
Thumbs in the eyes.

17:02.167 --> 17:03.762
Where's Ryder?

17:06.598 --> 17:08.131
She was at the crime scene.

17:08.156 --> 17:10.371
- Yeah, I got your message.
- Who?

17:10.396 --> 17:11.877
Bethany Mansfield.

17:11.903 --> 17:14.347
Last night. Looking for something.

17:14.372 --> 17:16.092
What'll you give me not to tell Peter

17:16.117 --> 17:17.719
that you're sniffing at the mayor's kid?

17:17.743 --> 17:18.992
How 'bout I don't tell him

17:19.017 --> 17:20.983
that you drank the emergency whiskey?

17:21.319 --> 17:22.711
Deal.

17:23.012 --> 17:25.376
Do we have anything in evidence
that she could've been looking for?

17:25.400 --> 17:28.539
She was on her knees.
So something small.

17:29.359 --> 17:30.766
His tooth.

17:30.959 --> 17:33.077
Teen girls get obsessed with weird shit.

17:33.102 --> 17:35.440
I had a cousin once
so obsessed with horses

17:35.465 --> 17:38.166
she wore a horse hair necklace everyday.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.113
Paris.

17:53.182 --> 17:54.716
Bethany.

17:54.751 --> 17:57.137
I think this is considered harassment.

17:58.187 --> 18:00.287
This is yours, right?

18:00.323 --> 18:03.123
Your Paris thing. Eiffel Tower earring?

18:03.582 --> 18:06.543
We have a picture of Jesse wearing
it the night he went missing.

18:08.361 --> 18:09.627
It's not mine.

18:09.652 --> 18:11.918
You can get those at
like, any jewelry store.

18:17.154 --> 18:18.832
We're gonna take a ride.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.678
I can put the sirens on, if you want.

18:29.648 --> 18:33.037
We found his tooth... there.

18:38.226 --> 18:40.326
His skin was on the fence.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.632
He was here. You were here.

18:48.934 --> 18:51.135
You're up to your neck in shit.

18:51.406 --> 18:52.835
Talk.

18:57.478 --> 18:58.948
We thought...

18:59.231 --> 19:01.580
five times would do the job.

19:02.096 --> 19:04.917
But we only made it
through three sessions.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.643
Take me through. Step by step.

19:52.565 --> 19:54.337
Agh!

20:04.301 --> 20:06.510
Wait, are you telling me he wanted it?

20:06.545 --> 20:09.147
He didn't wanna be weird anymore.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.897
Sick people should be helped.

20:13.225 --> 20:15.029
We were helping.

20:15.216 --> 20:17.661
And it was working. And then...

20:23.605 --> 20:25.504
What the hell, man?

20:25.717 --> 20:27.078
Take that off.

20:28.308 --> 20:31.578
I'm done with this, okay.

20:31.603 --> 20:32.927
Take. It. Off.

20:32.952 --> 20:35.353
- I'm still me.
- You're sick, man.

20:35.378 --> 20:36.748
- You're a homo...
- Shut up.

20:36.773 --> 20:39.140
- Dress wearing... weirdo freak.
- Shut up! Shut up!

20:39.321 --> 20:41.576
You're supposed to be my friend!

20:42.145 --> 20:44.411
I'm not a freak.

20:44.603 --> 20:47.671
Your girlfriend seems
to like me this way.

20:47.696 --> 20:49.095
He's lying!

20:49.120 --> 20:52.035
You know, maybe you just
need to try a pair.

20:57.603 --> 20:59.022
Fuck you.

20:59.328 --> 21:01.694
- Agh!
- Jacob!

21:07.839 --> 21:10.022
Jesse no! Jesse stop!

21:10.373 --> 21:12.725
Jacob stop! You're gonna kill him!

21:12.750 --> 21:15.031
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

21:18.008 --> 21:19.625
Get off of him!

21:23.064 --> 21:25.049
I went to go get help,

21:25.074 --> 21:26.609
but then Jacob called

21:26.634 --> 21:29.351
and he said that they
left and that he was okay.

21:29.376 --> 21:31.370
You didn't see him after that?

21:31.851 --> 21:33.697
Why didn't you come forward?

21:46.386 --> 21:48.752
You can put the pictures away.

21:50.569 --> 21:53.928
I'm not doing this anymore.

21:56.196 --> 21:57.920
I tried.

21:58.492 --> 22:00.075
And I can't.

22:00.108 --> 22:01.764
My earrings?

22:01.789 --> 22:03.365
You stole them?

22:10.010 --> 22:11.735
I'm leaving.

22:13.735 --> 22:17.243
And I wanted something
to remember you by.

22:17.483 --> 22:21.204
You know, I, I used to wish that...

22:22.080 --> 22:23.723
it was me...

22:24.553 --> 22:26.506
instead of Jacob.

22:34.267 --> 22:38.001
What if I liked him... like that.

22:39.891 --> 22:43.406
You saw something beautiful in Jesse.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.241
<i>There's nothing wrong with that.</i>

23:05.604 --> 23:07.853
You get out there.
You play for Jesse.

23:07.878 --> 23:10.157
You play for the little
town that worships you.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.435
Can you hear 'em? Go! Go! Go!

23:12.470 --> 23:14.831
Yeah, Brady's here.

23:14.856 --> 23:16.189
We'll bring 'em in.

23:26.483 --> 23:28.017
We're pulling them off the ice, right?

23:28.052 --> 23:30.648
No way. We can grab 'em
in the locker room after.

23:30.673 --> 23:31.840
This is so messed up.

23:31.865 --> 23:34.299
Since when is hockey more
important than a missing kid?

23:36.700 --> 23:38.356
Jesse!

23:38.381 --> 23:41.434
Hey, where is Jesse?
Gone to get a boob job?

23:46.209 --> 23:47.541
Where is the queer boy?

23:47.576 --> 23:49.965
Maybe he's on his period?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.296
Agh!

23:58.321 --> 24:00.891
That looked like assault to me.

24:22.404 --> 24:25.264
They were hung over. I was there.

24:25.552 --> 24:27.662
You shouldn't say that.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.478
I got nothing from Jacob.

24:29.503 --> 24:31.923
He says Bethany is just
trying to save herself.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.728
Anything from Max?

24:34.769 --> 24:37.904
Jacob Cowan has got a bit of
psychopath in his eyes?

24:37.929 --> 24:41.345
His mom definitely
doesn't hug him enough.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.815
Get Max back in here. Have a go at him.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.351
Give me something on him.
Something his team knows.

24:47.387 --> 24:49.820
He's got a thing for Tom's wife.

24:51.041 --> 24:54.619
- Something hockey.
- He's weak on his glove side.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.054
Good luck.

25:03.965 --> 25:05.922
He says it was you.

25:05.947 --> 25:07.414
The leader.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.908
Jacob's saying you
were the last one there,

25:11.219 --> 25:13.276
that he ran, you didn't.

25:13.312 --> 25:14.750
That's not true!

25:14.883 --> 25:16.847
The other cops believe it.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.572
You assaulting that ref...

25:18.597 --> 25:20.779
doesn't help people's view of you.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.709
I hear Jacob was pretty jealous.

25:26.374 --> 25:28.897
Is that why he's trying
to pin the blame on you?

25:29.127 --> 25:31.091
- He wouldn't do that.
- Right.

25:31.116 --> 25:33.773
He also wouldn't say you couldn't
stop a puck with your glove hand

25:33.798 --> 25:35.913
if a blow job from Tom's
wife depended on it.

25:35.938 --> 25:38.897
Hey, alright... wait...
that's, that's unnecessary.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.270
Jacob went nuts,

25:46.327 --> 25:47.872
like possessed.

25:48.446 --> 25:49.841
Started kicking Jesse.

25:49.866 --> 25:52.169
It was crazy. Then we ran.

25:53.606 --> 25:55.239
Even Jacob?

25:56.738 --> 25:57.848
Yeah.

25:59.556 --> 26:01.152
But he went back.

26:02.211 --> 26:03.776
Alone?

26:08.822 --> 26:11.160
I want you to be really clear...

26:11.602 --> 26:14.836
there are huge
consequences for lying here.

26:14.861 --> 26:16.400
I'm not lying.

26:17.081 --> 26:18.525
I wasn't there.

26:18.916 --> 26:21.075
Your teammate gave you up, man.

26:21.111 --> 26:22.544
No way.

26:22.579 --> 26:24.994
He said you were possessed. Crazy.

26:25.019 --> 26:26.459
Yeah 'cause he just saw his girlfriend

26:26.483 --> 26:28.955
up in the business of
some weirdo in a dress.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.775
You just lost control.

26:31.353 --> 26:33.390
It's messed up. I get it.

26:33.742 --> 26:35.255
You treat her so good.

26:35.290 --> 26:36.812
You turn around and...

26:36.837 --> 26:38.727
he's what she wants?

26:40.202 --> 26:41.955
<i>She said it was nothing.</i>

26:41.980 --> 26:44.413
He kissed her and she pushed him away,

26:45.830 --> 26:47.968
but you saw in her face,

26:49.554 --> 26:51.069
she was lying.

26:52.839 --> 26:54.632
She liked it.

26:55.968 --> 26:58.059
They deserve each other.

26:58.345 --> 27:00.278
Because they're freaks.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.786
But you're not, right?

27:05.190 --> 27:06.614
Although...

27:06.983 --> 27:09.917
that's not how other
people are gonna see it.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.871
They're gonna lump you into
the same weird triangle.

27:16.441 --> 27:18.034
That's not right.

27:18.069 --> 27:19.824
Is it, Mr. Cowan?

27:24.931 --> 27:27.863
Maybe you even thought
about it for a sec.

27:29.574 --> 27:31.801
Seeing her with him.

27:31.826 --> 27:33.386
Like that.

27:35.052 --> 27:37.510
What does that say about you?

27:41.658 --> 27:43.158
So you lost it.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.360
You hit him.

27:45.396 --> 27:47.787
And your friend hauled you away.

27:48.065 --> 27:51.037
But you could tell
from Jesse's cocky face...

27:51.591 --> 27:54.677
that the next morning the
whole town was gonna know...

27:54.702 --> 27:56.896
and you couldn't let that happen.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.022
So you went back.

27:59.047 --> 28:01.960
Shit, man. I mean, I would've.

28:27.035 --> 28:29.184
Jacob says he went
back to the scrap yard,

28:29.209 --> 28:30.342
but before he got there,

28:30.367 --> 28:32.340
he saw Jesse get in a white truck

28:32.365 --> 28:35.175
about half a mile up route
190 by the old gas station.

28:35.210 --> 28:36.559
On the way to the Rez.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.918
So I want you to start checking the DMV,

28:38.943 --> 28:40.814
and all the security
cameras in the area.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.427
He says, he couldn't
tell who was driving

28:42.451 --> 28:44.317
or what kind of truck it was.

28:44.762 --> 28:47.087
He's a hockey player. They love trucks.

28:47.122 --> 28:48.122
The kid's lying.

28:48.147 --> 28:49.794
Well, we'll hold him
here as long as we can.

28:49.818 --> 28:51.146
What the hell is up route 190?

28:51.171 --> 28:52.747
Nothing anymore.

28:52.989 --> 28:55.108
Okay. I want you to check it out anyway.

28:58.249 --> 28:59.866
If he's lying we're nowhere.

28:59.901 --> 29:02.655
No. We have a lead.

29:03.104 --> 29:05.571
It's been too long to only have a lead.

29:07.878 --> 29:10.308
So nothing new from our friend?

29:11.387 --> 29:13.373
You should go home and get some sleep.

29:13.398 --> 29:14.949
At least see your kid.

29:20.554 --> 29:21.920
Got the trace.

29:21.955 --> 29:24.156
It was a call to dispatch about Driver.

29:24.191 --> 29:26.325
Being out by the old church.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.708
Male caller from a
payphone on Barnes Road.

29:29.747 --> 29:32.133
Should I tell Annie? She was asking.

29:32.158 --> 29:34.558
No. Don't.

29:51.019 --> 29:53.619
I was supposed to meet
Jesse the other night.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.096
And he never showed.

29:56.885 --> 29:59.490
I went looking for him
and I saw him in a truck.

29:59.919 --> 30:01.387
What color truck?

30:01.908 --> 30:03.271
It's white.

30:04.029 --> 30:05.544
What time?

30:07.358 --> 30:09.071
It's around 1:30.

30:10.153 --> 30:12.180
Why were you supposed to meet?

30:12.960 --> 30:14.892
We were gonna get out of here.

30:16.442 --> 30:17.744
Together?

30:20.603 --> 30:22.322
As in...?

30:26.651 --> 30:28.287
Who's that?

30:28.312 --> 30:29.709
My wife.

30:33.492 --> 30:35.472
Were you and Jesse together?

30:43.386 --> 30:44.778
Yeah.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.669
Daisy?

31:06.131 --> 31:07.456
Where's my kid?

31:07.492 --> 31:10.425
Sleep over. You okay, Annie?

31:11.461 --> 31:13.101
Things are just...

31:13.767 --> 31:15.398
so weird.

31:15.647 --> 31:18.274
I just come here for a
second to feel normal.

31:18.931 --> 31:21.336
You show up at your baby
daddy/ex-boyfriend's house

31:21.361 --> 31:23.899
and get into bed with him for normalcy?

31:24.708 --> 31:26.595
Are you my ex-boyfriend?

31:27.408 --> 31:28.779
I don't know.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.116
These are my arms.

31:35.152 --> 31:37.756
If I couldn't come here
I don't know what I'd do.

31:39.467 --> 31:41.523
You can have sex with other people,

31:41.558 --> 31:44.324
but don't get anyone
pregnant. That's our thing.

31:44.615 --> 31:47.061
And I won't get pregnant with anyone.

31:47.096 --> 31:49.496
You can't have sex with anyone else.

31:49.818 --> 31:51.331
Ever?

31:51.367 --> 31:53.732
Just... no. Not ever.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.092
Me knowing that would
not go well for me or him.

31:57.753 --> 31:59.386
'Cause I'd kill him.

32:00.013 --> 32:02.514
Then you'd have to
investigate me for murder.

32:02.645 --> 32:04.686
I wouldn't even get to.

32:04.711 --> 32:07.281
Conflict of interest.
It'd be Virginia's case.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.150
That woman needs to
have sex. But you don't.

32:10.186 --> 32:12.396
You're free-wheeling.
Your cool. Your easy.

32:12.421 --> 32:13.967
You don't need it.

32:19.127 --> 32:21.260
I didn't know you had
to buy your own tools.

32:21.296 --> 32:22.869
Yeah. Don't worry.

32:22.894 --> 32:24.845
Everything's gonna be great.

32:25.167 --> 32:26.853
I'm feeling good.

32:30.172 --> 32:32.670
I was with scary teenagers today.

32:33.174 --> 32:35.274
Remember that age?

32:35.310 --> 32:37.115
It's so feral.

32:37.312 --> 32:38.722
I can't believe we made it out alive...

32:38.746 --> 32:41.414
that you didn't murder me.

32:41.545 --> 32:43.749
There were times.

32:43.784 --> 32:46.243
Probably would've if it
hadn't been for Daisy.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.978
Do you think we should just
live in the same house again?

32:53.448 --> 32:55.214
What am I doing here?

32:56.788 --> 32:58.130
You're doing everything you can.

32:58.165 --> 33:00.685
No I'm not. I'm half in, and half out.

33:00.710 --> 33:01.845
Maybe there's more I could do.

33:01.869 --> 33:04.008
'Cause if somebody says they
know something, maybe they do.

33:04.032 --> 33:05.332
Okay, what are you talking about?

33:05.356 --> 33:07.091
I just think maybe that
I'm not in a position

33:07.115 --> 33:09.216
to ignore the possibility
that somebody knows something

33:09.240 --> 33:11.353
when there's a kid missing,
his mom's in torture

33:11.378 --> 33:12.750
and all we have is a lead.

33:12.775 --> 33:14.212
Who are you ignoring?

33:14.248 --> 33:15.747
I don't know what to do.

33:15.772 --> 33:17.272
Maybe you just need to get some sleep.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.329
- I'll keep you warm.
- No. I can't just sleep. I have to...

33:19.353 --> 33:22.083
I can't follow you if you
get in over your head anymore.

33:22.677 --> 33:24.510
I need to be here.

33:28.021 --> 33:29.810
I love you for being here.

33:42.651 --> 33:46.682
<i>"If she tells, she never
learns the truth about either."</i>

33:59.324 --> 34:00.623
Shit!

34:17.574 --> 34:19.342
Remember me.

34:44.868 --> 34:47.744
Holly, you got hurt.

34:47.768 --> 34:49.502
You're ripped.

35:01.251 --> 35:04.587
<i>"The more you take
away, the larger it becomes."</i>

35:05.655 --> 35:07.556
"A hole."

35:41.217 --> 35:44.474
Sandy Driver, fingernails
missing from hands.

35:47.093 --> 35:50.015
Fingernails not recovered.

36:08.639 --> 36:10.492
What the hell?

37:13.651 --> 37:17.594
"What is the thing
that travelers pursue?"

37:17.619 --> 37:20.754
"Hard to hunt, not hard to view."

37:21.966 --> 37:25.516
"The nearer you get, the
faster it runs from you."

37:44.953 --> 37:47.155
"There you will find..."

37:47.180 --> 37:49.999
"a fish out of the water."

38:23.669 --> 38:25.636
I just came for my books.

38:25.764 --> 38:27.964
You know I'd kill anyone
If they hurt you, right?

38:28.421 --> 38:30.987
And I wouldn't go to jail
because I'd be totally justified.

38:31.150 --> 38:33.198
Jail could be good for you.

38:33.223 --> 38:36.019
I think you could benefit from routine.

38:37.514 --> 38:41.066
Well, if I go down, I'm
taking you down with me.

38:49.085 --> 38:51.151
Who was that person at the car?

38:51.501 --> 38:53.201
I don't know, babe.

38:54.601 --> 38:57.377
- Are you scared?
- Not now.

38:57.492 --> 38:59.409
That's what they'd want.

39:00.428 --> 39:02.529
Don't be too brave.

39:02.554 --> 39:04.854
It's overrated.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.713
No.

39:11.014 --> 39:14.293
Okay, fine.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.036
See you later.

39:25.941 --> 39:28.770
Don't laugh, but I do these
brain teasers to clear my mind

39:28.795 --> 39:31.184
and I'm stuck on one
'cause... I'm over-thinking.

39:31.209 --> 39:32.426
So I'm like, who can I call

39:32.451 --> 39:34.302
that's never gonna be at
risk of over-thinking...

39:34.326 --> 39:36.441
I'm your man. What do you got?

39:36.466 --> 39:39.020
"What is the thing
that travelers pursue?"

39:39.045 --> 39:42.112
"Hard to hunt, not hard to view."

39:42.255 --> 39:45.559
"The nearer you get, the
faster it runs from you."

39:45.653 --> 39:48.113
"Here you'll find a fish out of water."

39:48.138 --> 39:51.172
That's the second part. So,
that's got to be a place.

39:51.261 --> 39:54.372
A place that seems
within your reach.

39:54.397 --> 39:58.239
Yet moves closer you get to it.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.818
Travelers...

40:00.843 --> 40:04.029
experience the chance to...

40:04.105 --> 40:06.072
The chance to broaden...

40:06.097 --> 40:08.138
broaden your...

40:08.230 --> 40:09.849
your horizon.

40:14.450 --> 40:17.638
Didn't there used to be an old
mental hospital called New Horizons?

40:17.663 --> 40:19.685
Maybe? Why?

41:42.428 --> 41:45.028
"There you will find
a fish out of water."

42:01.193 --> 42:02.377
Scratches.

42:03.270 --> 42:05.783
Blood and fingernail scratches.

42:06.484 --> 42:08.698
Someone was out here long time ago...

42:08.723 --> 42:10.309
Sandy.

43:12.319 --> 43:15.563
Next Monday. Two
murders, decades apart, are linked.

43:15.588 --> 43:17.739
I just pulled a dead
body out of this water

43:17.764 --> 43:19.741
and you're talking to me
about a twenty-year-old murder?

43:19.765 --> 43:20.909
What it they're connected?

43:20.934 --> 43:22.802
As Annie plays a deadly game.

43:22.903 --> 43:24.503
You may be talking
to a killer right now.
