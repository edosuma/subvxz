00:17.927 --> 00:19.786
We'd also like to take a moment

00:19.787 --> 00:25.857
to recognize our military servicemen
and women flying with us today.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.461
On behalf of this entire crew,
we thank you for your service

00:29.463 --> 00:31.463
and welcome you home.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.762
As we begin our initial descent,

00:32.765 --> 00:37.334
please make sure your seat backs
and tray tables are in their...

03:12.925 --> 03:14.659
Can you gift wrap this for me?

03:14.661 --> 03:16.761
We don't do that.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.229
Ohh! Aah!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.898
I baked you a cake,
you little shit.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.198
What are you doing here already?

03:54.200 --> 03:57.002
- I got in early.
- No shit, you got in early.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.004
- I'm throwing you a surprise party.
- For real?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.206
You better fuckin'
act surprised.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.607
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.942
- Get over here.
- What?

04:03.944 --> 04:06.978
Shut up. Let me look at you.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.147
You look skinny.
You lost weight?

04:09.149 --> 04:11.049
I don't know.

04:12.718 --> 04:15.153
Oh, wow. Look at you.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.656
What is that? Gimme a real hug.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.561
Hey, I got something for you.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.673
- Thanks, Nelly.
- What? You don't like it?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.208
Your niece ain't a kid anymore.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.911
So I'll keep it, then.
I'll get you something else.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.613
What you want, condoms?

04:42.281 --> 04:44.616
Don't say that to her.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.451
- Go put on your dress blues.
- Come on, Ange.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.053
- I just got in.
- I don't care.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.689
- They're all wrinkly.
- So fuckin' iron them.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.857
- And the white gloves.
- I ain't wearing the gloves.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.726
Yes you are. I like them.
They're nice.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.661
I gotta go see Livvy.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.129
No, you don't.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.729
- Why not?
- Ma, think the cake's done.

04:59.731 --> 05:02.300
- Because it's a surprise party.
- You invited her, right?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.302
- Of course I did.
- Ma!

05:04.304 --> 05:05.904
- What?
- The cake's burning!

05:05.906 --> 05:07.672
So take it out, mama.

05:54.255 --> 05:55.354
Ha ha ha!

05:55.355 --> 05:59.224
- Oh, shit! What up?

05:59.226 --> 06:01.826
- Yo, when you got back?
- Just now, man.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.361
Damn, welcome home.
When's the parade?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.096
You deserve a parade, my nigga.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.765
- Where's Cezar?
- Let me shape you up.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.433
They don't got
no barber shops in Iraq?

06:08.435 --> 06:11.269
- Afghanistan.
- It's all long-ass Taliban beards n' shit?

06:11.271 --> 06:14.706
Hey, yo, how many a-rabs
you shot out there?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.006
C'mon, man. Why you ask me that?

06:16.008 --> 06:17.442
Yo, sit down. Let me cut you up.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.911
- I'll see you later.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.746
What's up? You don't trust me?

06:21.748 --> 06:22.846
Tell Cezar I'll be back.

06:22.848 --> 06:24.246
You not happy,
you don't gotta pay.

06:24.248 --> 06:26.785
I'm not happy,
I got a fucked up cut.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.319
Free, I do it for free,
so c'mon, man.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.421
Cezar's my barber.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.826
You know my shit is Gucci.

06:38.297 --> 06:39.764
Oy.

06:44.804 --> 06:47.172
Ah!

07:03.289 --> 07:06.925
Mmm. Damn.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.094
What?

07:09.096 --> 07:13.398
- You smell so good.
- I need to take a shower.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.901
Nah. Don't take a shower
ever again.

07:29.415 --> 07:31.416
It's crazy to hear your voice.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.119
Like, in person.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.989
You sound different
on the phone.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.992
How did I sound?

07:40.994 --> 07:43.128
I can't explain.

07:44.296 --> 07:47.265
Soft.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.869
- And sexy.
- That's 'cause I was at work.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.104
I like it when
you talk like that.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.440
Get off of me.

07:59.311 --> 08:03.081
- Where you gonna live now?
- With you.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.252
Our place is kinda small.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.221
So let's get
a bigger place, then.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.991
- You don't like my place?
- No, I do.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.059
- You said this place is...
- No one helped me move.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.328
I had to hire these guys
and they broke my desk.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.532
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've had people come.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.102
I couldn't reach you.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.474
So what you need moved?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.509
Let's move things right now.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.878
Want me to move this bed?

09:09.281 --> 09:12.183
Nelson! Welcome back, papi!

09:12.185 --> 09:15.220
Hey. Shh.
It's supposed to be a surprise.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.589
- Okay. I'll see you inside.
- Okay.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.624
- How you doing?
- Fine.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.560
You look beautiful.
She's beautiful.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.962
Thank you.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.410
He's coming. He's coming!

09:39.412 --> 09:43.014
He's coming. Shh.
Listen. Shh, be quiet.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.983
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
He's coming.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.417
He's coming. Shhh.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.219
Come here, come here.

09:49.555 --> 09:52.357
Shh! Shh.

09:54.326 --> 09:56.527
Surprise!

10:03.502 --> 10:04.669
Whoo!

10:10.609 --> 10:12.076
All grown up.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.982
- You're so cute.
- Pick me.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.218
Here you go. Oliver, all right.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.620
We're gonna look at the camera
and we're gonna say "cheese."

10:22.622 --> 10:25.990
Cheese!

10:31.530 --> 10:34.032
- No, you don't.
- Ow.

10:43.475 --> 10:46.044
- My man.
- Maury.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.281
Hey, you know you were
missed out here.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.350
Yeah, well,
I'm happy to be home.

10:52.352 --> 10:56.154
- How you been?
- These are interesting times.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.254
Yeah, that's a nice hat.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.257
- You like this?
- Yeah, it looks good.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.357
- Well, it's yours.
- No.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.994
- Hey, I want you to have it.
- It's not me.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.463
But it looks good on you.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.734
- You know I moved.
- No. Where you at now?

11:09.736 --> 11:12.403
I bought a house over
in south Hadley.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.372
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.241
- You're moving on up.
- It's a really cute place.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.211
- You should stop by.
- You brought the birds with you, right?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.146
Of course.
They love it out there.

11:22.148 --> 11:27.485
- What did you learn out in the marines?
- I learned a lot.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.585
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.588
- Know about computers?
- Computers?

11:30.590 --> 11:33.024
Yeah, in the commercials
they're all on the computers.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.993
Nah, not me.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.161
What employable skills
do you currently possess?

11:37.163 --> 11:39.664
I know about heavy artillery.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.567
- You gonna re-enlist?
- I don't think so.

11:44.069 --> 11:47.071
- Thought about jobs?
- No, but I need to.

11:52.177 --> 11:56.447
Do you know why Dominicans
make great drug dealers? Hmm?

11:56.449 --> 11:59.117
Because they know
how to talk to people.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.085
In the '80s, Colombians,
they had all the product

12:01.087 --> 12:03.221
but zero people skills.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.424
Boricuas, Peruvians...

12:06.426 --> 12:08.760
No one knew how
to talk to black people.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.095
Dominicans can sell anyone.

12:12.097 --> 12:14.365
Black, white, purple, brown.

12:14.367 --> 12:18.669
In this business, it's all
about personal relationships.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.640
I could use a man like you.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.610
How do you feel about
steering the ship?

12:25.612 --> 12:28.713
- Me?
- I need someone I can trust.

12:30.349 --> 12:34.185
What do you say, Nelson?
Your own enterprise.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.558
I appreciate the offer.
I really do.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.194
But I'm trying to do
something else right now.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.464
Like what?

12:47.733 --> 12:50.768
Settle down, have a family.

12:53.672 --> 12:57.075
- You're a family man.
- That's the plan.

12:58.844 --> 13:02.747
Okay. It's a good plan.

14:05.878 --> 14:10.681
"Silver frame, half-tint, non-polarized
photochromatic lenses."

14:12.484 --> 14:13.751
Yo, you not looking, though.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.586
I seen 'em. They a'ight.

14:17.756 --> 14:20.591
Nah, but check it, though.

14:20.593 --> 14:24.428
All nigga. Two-for-one, kid.
Only two fifty.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.698
- And you got two of the same?
- Nah, one's for you, kid.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.467
- Nah.
- We can rock 'em together.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.968
I don't want
the same glasses as you.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.803
Man, send a message out there.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.238
It's like when
they looking at you,

14:34.240 --> 14:35.907
is like they looking at me.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.279
What's going on?

14:47.219 --> 14:50.188
Those fuckers is back
on state street.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.522
Again?

14:52.591 --> 14:56.227
- Go check on that.
- We got this.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.262
Yeah, I got something for 'em.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.347
Yo.

15:17.216 --> 15:20.384
Yo!

15:20.386 --> 15:23.588
- What's good, Nelly?
- My brother.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.788
Good. My little man growing.

15:24.790 --> 15:28.459
- Nobody little here.
- I see that. You getting strong, son.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.962
- I been lifting.
- Yeah? What's this, then, huh?

15:30.964 --> 15:34.532
- What up? Do something.
- C'mon, man.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.835
- Call me daddy.
- Fuck off of me.

15:37.837 --> 15:38.935
You still my son, though.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.339
I'm just glad you made it
back in one piece.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.341
Well, you know how I do.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.811
Yo, I gotta talk to you.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.380
- Talk to me.
- Yeah, not here, though.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.416
A'ight. Meet you out front.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.352
All right.

15:55.954 --> 15:58.556
- What's he doing here?
- What do you mean?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.993
He came to see me. Going
to the store right quick.

16:01.995 --> 16:05.263
- What for?
- Get some ice.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.832
- We ain't outta ice.
- What's going on?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.834
Nothing.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.704
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.707
It's a party. Be festive.

16:21.413 --> 16:25.416
- I see godfather in there?
- Yeah, yeah, he's here.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.020
- He doing good.
- Maurice is always doing good.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.322
- You working with him?
- Nah.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.525
Why the fuck not?
That's the major leagues, kid.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.993
I'm done with all that.

16:36.928 --> 16:38.362
All right.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.968
Well, shit, maybe you can
put my name is his ear.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.870
For what?

16:45.872 --> 16:50.574

My name ring bells.

16:50.576 --> 16:54.312
I been in these streets

16:54.314 --> 16:57.548
We both soldiers.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.583
What is it you need to tell me?

17:06.858 --> 17:08.726
Nicky Quinn knows you're back.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.863
He want payback for that shit
we did to his brother.

17:16.501 --> 17:19.403
- How you know this?
- White boy Luis.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.372
- He works for them now?
- Yeah.

17:23.775 --> 17:25.643
It's just real different
out here.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.648
- The streets is talking.
- What's the talk?

17:31.650 --> 17:34.352
They trying to catch a body.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.619
That's you.

17:38.623 --> 17:41.525
- Where's Nicky at now?
- They say he staying out in N.Y.

17:41.527 --> 17:45.596
But he coming in tonight
on the late boat.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.865
Soon as he's here,
they getting busy.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.401
You want us to call up the team?

17:51.036 --> 17:52.937
I got you, kid.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.976
Yeah, I don't know.
I hit you up later.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.082
Yo, Nel.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.953
Why'd you come back?

18:08.955 --> 18:11.489
Where else am I gonna go?

18:17.162 --> 18:19.130
I don't see no ice.

18:59.839 --> 19:03.841
Y'all motherfuckers
really don't listen, huh?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.176
Y'all gotta move.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.711
This is me right here.
I do this here.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.014
Stay the fuck out the flats.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.583
Where'd you put the work at?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.885
What? You think
I'm playing with you?

19:21.693 --> 19:22.927
Yo, get off of him!

19:27.632 --> 19:29.467
Yo, back up.

19:31.903 --> 19:33.971
I'm serious, man. Fall back.

19:53.658 --> 19:54.859
What's going on?

19:56.161 --> 19:59.163
I need everyone out of here.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.012
You picked a hell
of a time to go up there.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.048
- It's just for a couple days.
- You and your criminal friends.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.448
Why do you keep
calling them that?

20:19.450 --> 20:22.253
- Because that's what they are.
- Not all of them.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.990
Oh, I'm sorry. My apologies to your one
friend who doesn't have a criminal record.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.993
I'd love to meet him.
Maybe we could all get brunch.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.894
You at least gonna Finnish
the goddamned crib?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.097
I already told you,
it don't got all the parts.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.199
- Did you call Ikea?
- They said they'd send them.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.534
When?

20:37.969 --> 20:39.904
Soon.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.540
And you're just gonna leave
all that shit on the floor.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.574
I can't even walk around
barefoot in my own house.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.674
Just don't walk there.

20:45.676 --> 20:47.745
One of those little screws
might roll around.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.914
- It's on the rug.
- I walk on the rug.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.750
I sit on the rug.
That's my grandma's rug!

20:52.752 --> 20:55.986
- Why are you shouting at me?
- Because I'm stressed.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.088
And when I get stressed,
my brain gets stressed.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.658
And when my brain gets stressed
it makes cortisol.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.960
You ever heard of it?
It's toxic, by the way.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.660
That's what you're doing
to me right now.

21:04.662 --> 21:06.830
And that goes down through me
and poisons him.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.466
I want you to know that's what
you're doing. You're poisoning us!

21:09.468 --> 21:10.766
No one's poisoning you, Janine.

21:10.768 --> 21:13.070
Can't you just do something nice
for once in your life

21:13.072 --> 21:15.306
so I can create
dopamine instead of poison?

21:15.308 --> 21:19.076
- The doctor said you should...
- Are you a doctor?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.276
Did you even get your g.E.D.?

21:20.278 --> 21:24.848
- I passed the math.
- Do you come to any of the appointments with us?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.950
- Some.
- The fuck do you know what the doctor says?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.186
- I know what the doctor says.
- What'd the doctor say?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.388
- That I need to relax!
- So do that.

21:32.223 --> 21:34.191
Go fuck yourself, Nicky.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.282
You just gonna sit there
and eat cake?

21:58.284 --> 22:00.250
- Angie baked it.
- It burned.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.186
- Teresa, go to your room.
- Why I gotta go?

22:02.188 --> 22:05.222
- Now!
- Every fucking time.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.358
- We need to leave town.
- I ain't going nowhere.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.693
- We can be in Boston tonight.
- Boston.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.862
- We can stay at my uncle's.
- I don't know about that.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.765
- What's there to know?
- I'll call him right now.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.035
- I just got home. Damn.
- Well, shit's changed a little ways.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.470
- Well, I've changed too.
- Baby...

22:19.472 --> 22:20.870
Can I have my cake
and eat it, too?

22:20.872 --> 22:23.273
- That's not even what it means.
- What the fuck you mean?

22:23.275 --> 22:25.843
Can you just do this for me? We
still gonna get a place together?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.845
- Of course.
- So let's do that.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.180
- In Boston?
- It's not that far.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.283
- What about your job?
- I'll find work out there.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.719
- Your uncle don't like me.
- He'll get over it.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.023
None of that matters.
We'll figure it out.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.193
There are people coming
to kill you.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.295
Get the fuck out
of here already.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.434
I don't like this.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.039
It's just a couple days.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.986
- Can I help you?
- Two for Boston.

23:10.856 --> 23:11.889
Just missed one.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.060
That'll be $42.50.

23:24.269 --> 23:27.371
Do you know what time the last
bus from New York gets in?

23:30.842 --> 23:33.911
Last bus from port authority
gets in at...

23:35.246 --> 23:37.247
11:55 pm.

23:41.252 --> 23:43.353
Wanna get something to eat?

23:43.355 --> 23:45.389
I'm good.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.825
You'll like Boston. You'll see.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.893
I ain't with the Red Sox.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.396
- You don't like big papi?
- I am big papi.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.766
- Yeah, but you're kinda short, though.
- Fuck you.

24:15.487 --> 24:16.487
Good book?

24:18.323 --> 24:21.859
- Excuse me?
- It look like a good book.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.894
It's a magazine.

24:26.464 --> 24:29.500
- Trouble getting your ticket?
- I'm sorry?

24:29.502 --> 24:33.971
'Cause, I had trouble with mine.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.406
Think some of the buses
is having problems.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.476
Yeah. Problems.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.983
- Where you say you was going?
- I didn't.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.986
What's up?
These guys bothering you?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.921
- It's all right.
- We was just asking...

24:50.923 --> 24:52.790
- I'm not talking to you.
- Let's go outside.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.458
- You going somewhere?
- Do I know you?

24:54.460 --> 24:56.460
How far you gonna run this time?

24:56.462 --> 24:58.996
- Don't make us go too far.
- You don't have to go nowhere,

24:58.998 --> 25:00.396
- I'm right here.
- Don't do this.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.366
- You got something to do?
- Who the fuck is you?

25:02.368 --> 25:04.134
- I got this.
- Got what?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.669
- You wanna swing at me?
- Walk away.

25:05.671 --> 25:06.769
Go ahead, swing at me, son.

25:06.771 --> 25:09.339
- Tell your bitch to get out the way.
- What the fuck you say?

25:09.341 --> 25:11.108
Look at me! Look at me!
Look at me!

25:11.110 --> 25:14.444
The hell is wrong with you?

25:14.446 --> 25:16.346
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Get yours soon enough.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.849
- You're cotton candy.
- Baby's bottom, nigga.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.218
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't start that!

25:21.220 --> 25:23.620
I don't care who started that.
What are you, five years old?

25:23.622 --> 25:25.355
I'm not gonna let
some dude disrespect you.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.357
- I didn't ask for that.
- You don't need to ask.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.326
You see? This is exactly
why we need to leave.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.061
I ain't going.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.232
- What?
- I can't go to Boston.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.332
What are you talking about?

25:36.334 --> 25:40.270
I can't wake up every day worried
about people coming to get me.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.572
So you're just gonna jump
back into the same bullshit?

25:42.574 --> 25:46.376
- Livvy, you didn't...
- No, that makes no sense.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.478
I ain't running this time.
I ain't scared.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.578
I waited for you.

25:49.580 --> 25:53.317
You messed up and you
went away and I waited.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.517
You promised me.

25:54.519 --> 25:59.488
You said no more running
around here, no more marines.

25:59.490 --> 26:01.225
I'm sorry.

26:03.127 --> 26:05.162
You fucking promised.

27:02.086 --> 27:04.488
- What's up?
- Kade's on his way now.

27:10.695 --> 27:12.129
Nel, yo!

27:17.001 --> 27:19.269
Good to see you, man.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.604
- Yo, sit down, I got you.
- I didn't come here for a cut.

27:21.606 --> 27:22.704
- Hey, yo. Listen up.

27:22.706 --> 27:24.708
What I tell you about
touching the remote, nigga?

27:24.710 --> 27:27.444
- Shut the fuck up, Cezar.
- I was at the bus station.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.948
I got into it with two dudes
from up the hill.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.916
- The fuck?
- They were talking shit to my girl.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.518
I think they were
waiting for me.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.654
- They messed with Livvy?
- These motherfuckers got no respect.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.223
Y'all know Nicky Quinn
is coming, right?

27:44.429 --> 27:45.562
Nicky Quinn?

27:47.265 --> 27:50.634
- Shit.
- Oh, he coming here?

27:50.636 --> 27:52.035
Fuck that.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.504
I need to know if y'all got me.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.506
Yo, I don't want
no problems in my shop, yo.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.477
- Fuck your shop.
- Nel, how you want to do this?

28:00.479 --> 28:03.447
The only thing I'm thinking is,
I wanna get 'em by surprise.

28:03.449 --> 28:06.650
- That's what's up.
- The bus gets in at midnight.

28:06.652 --> 28:09.753
As soon as they get out the station,
they're gonna be on central.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.688
There's no cops, no nothing.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.390
- Right.
- They get a few blocks away

28:13.392 --> 28:16.393
- we press 'em. That's it.
- Bomb, nigga.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.262
- I can get with that.
- Yo, we all down to fight for you, Nelson.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.164
Yo, who you fighting, son?

28:21.166 --> 28:23.633
- How many people they got?
- I don't know. I only saw two.

28:23.635 --> 28:26.136
- That ain't nothing.
- They might have more coming, though.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.671
- I'll Merc their whole family.
- We're closing early tonight.

28:28.673 --> 28:31.441
- What can I say?
- Pussy.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.417
- 'Sup, Nelson?
- Kade.

28:41.352 --> 28:42.586
I heard you was back.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.221
I am.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.356
What you come here for?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.392
So we could handle this.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.561
Why would we do that?

28:51.563 --> 28:54.564
It was been real quiet
for a minute now.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.466
Things are good. We making cake.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.269
There's no heat on us.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.304
It's true, Nel.

29:03.641 --> 29:06.743
Okay, so y'all doing good.
That's good.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.513
Why they done come
to our side and mess it up?

29:09.515 --> 29:12.182
This ain't about
the flats versus the hills.

29:12.184 --> 29:15.252
- They coming for you.
- I know what it is.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.354
Yo, don't nobody want
to see anything happen to you.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.456
Things changed.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.792
Yo, we can't
afford to spark a war.

29:24.328 --> 29:25.662
You left.

29:25.664 --> 29:28.665
You right. I did leave.

29:28.667 --> 29:33.437
You being back home can fuck
shit up for all of us here.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.706
It's like that?

29:39.277 --> 29:42.112
Yeah, it's like that.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.683
Should have never came back.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.528
Yo.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.864
Can't believe that
they soft, son.

30:03.501 --> 30:06.336
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.705
Yo, Nel, for real, I got you.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.475
You know that, right?
From what happened in there

30:11.477 --> 30:13.310
I ain't fucking
with 'em neither.

30:15.313 --> 30:19.116
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

30:21.552 --> 30:24.187
- What about your padrino?
- Maurice?

30:24.189 --> 30:26.590
- Yeah, maybe he could help.
- I don't think so.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.658
Man, he know everybody.
That's the o.G. Right there.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.293
I don't ask him
for favors like that.

30:30.295 --> 30:33.463
Maybe I could roll with you
just so he could know me,

30:33.465 --> 30:37.234
know what I mean? You know I got your back.
You know that, right?

30:37.236 --> 30:39.736
You know I keeps it hunnit.
You in a tight spot right now.

30:39.738 --> 30:42.839
- We gonna do what we gotta do, but what I'm saying...
- what are you saying?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.639
If you could introduce me
to your godfather,

30:44.641 --> 30:47.139
- we could be doing our thing for real.
- Again with this shit.

30:47.141 --> 30:50.247
My street hustle with your training?
We'd be unstoppable, kid.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.316
Fuck them niggas in the shop.

30:53.318 --> 30:54.851
This is what
we used to talk about.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.288
Me and you, Nelly.
We big time, kid.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.756
Oh, man, I'm not
listening to this.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.258
I gotta go.

31:01.528 --> 31:02.727
Oh, I see how it is.

31:02.728 --> 31:06.630
You not the one getting paid,
can't nobody else.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.331
You're starting
to irritate me right now.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.167
Nobody could shine but you, Nel.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.935
That's a'ight. That's a'ight,

31:11.937 --> 31:13.603
'cause I'ma put it like this.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.605
You don't trust me,
I don't trust you.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.574
You don't fight for me,
I don't fight for you.

31:17.576 --> 31:21.778
That's right, Tate.
You don't fight for me.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.581
- You're the same little bitch you always been.
- Yo, fuck you, Nelly.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.350
You better watch how
you speak to me right now.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.680
- What? You think you fucking Rambo, now?
- Babe.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.815
Just 'cause you went to war
you can't be touched?

31:58.817 --> 32:01.418
I'm talking to you. Look at
me when I'm talking to you.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.853
You think you tough, huh?

32:03.855 --> 32:06.523
- You got it like that?
- That's not what this is all about, Angie.

32:06.525 --> 32:11.261
Every little boy on every corner
swear they're "iron man 4".

32:11.263 --> 32:13.897
- Ain't none of you bulletproof! None!
- I know that.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.999
- So then fucking leave!
- I can't.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.802
They're already following me.

32:18.804 --> 32:20.770
They sat right there
at that station

32:20.772 --> 32:23.406
and watched me get my ticket.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.909
And, yo, even if I do get out,
what's gonna happen

32:25.911 --> 32:28.778
when they get here
and they don't find me, hmm?

32:28.780 --> 32:31.614
- They coming for you.
- Yeah, let them come for me. I wish they would.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.416
And what about Daiza?
She ready for all that?

32:33.418 --> 32:35.984
- You think I don't know my responsibilities?
- No. That's not...

32:35.986 --> 32:38.484
Like I don't know how to take
care of my own fucking daughter?

32:38.486 --> 32:40.422
I think you should
get outta town for a few days.

32:40.424 --> 32:41.722
You're telling me to leave now.

32:41.724 --> 32:43.659
Go down to Bridgeport.
Go see Edwin and the kids.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.028
Yeah. You're funny.

32:45.030 --> 32:47.330
This shit is gonna happen
for real.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.566
Ain't nothing gonna stop it.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.368
Then fucking go.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.903
There's nowhere to go.

32:53.905 --> 32:57.707
Where am I gonna go?
Back to Afghanistan?

32:59.277 --> 33:02.012
I can't do what I gotta do
while you here.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.281
I need to know you're safe.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.024
- You went down to the shop?
- I was just there.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.659
They standing with you on this?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.427
- No.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.796
What you mean, no?

33:21.699 --> 33:23.767
She doesn't want to talk to you.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.036
Will you tell her
I like to say good-bye?

33:27.305 --> 33:28.805
Hold on.

33:40.051 --> 33:43.586
- She doesn't care.
- I need to talk to her.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.823
- Too bad.
- Move out of my way.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.892
- Are you fucking deaf?
- -Daiza!

33:48.894 --> 33:50.360
- What?
- -Time for bed.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.729
- Why?
- -Now, Daiza.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.967
- Suck my balls.
- -Hey!

34:22.426 --> 34:24.994
I'm getting on that bus

34:24.996 --> 34:27.996
with or without you.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.699
Will you at least
give me a kiss?

34:33.603 --> 34:35.572
I really need a kiss.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.043
How am I supposed to shoot
anybody without a kiss?

34:40.045 --> 34:42.011
That's not funny.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.414
I know, I know.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.721
Look. When this is over,
we'll get married.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.125
We'll get outta here.

34:55.127 --> 34:57.927
We'll go anywhere you want.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.996
We'll go to Puerto Rico
if you like.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.565
I heard that shit before.

35:03.868 --> 35:06.136
We're gonna have three kids.

35:07.571 --> 35:10.740
Nah. We're gonna have six kids.

35:10.742 --> 35:13.710
I know you only want three,
but we gonna have to have six

35:13.712 --> 35:17.046
just in case the first three
come out retarded.

35:23.087 --> 35:27.557
Hey, we're gonna have that life together.
I promise you, a'ight?

35:30.928 --> 35:34.664
- Will you say something?
- What you want me to say?

35:34.666 --> 35:37.066
Say what you feel.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.002
I think you and me are done.

35:40.104 --> 35:42.672
Yeah, but don't say that.

35:45.976 --> 35:48.445
Baby, you don't mean that.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.186
All right.

35:59.089 --> 36:02.225
But I'ma see you later, though.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.694
I'ma handle this
then I'ma find you.

37:53.137 --> 37:56.105
Good evening, sir.
I'm a sergeant in the marines.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.675
- Today's my e.A.S. Day.
- Welcome home.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.344
Thank you. I was wondering,

38:01.346 --> 38:04.080
if I wanted to get in touch
with anyone I served with,

38:04.082 --> 38:07.216
- how will I do that?
- We don't have a department for that.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.219
- Have you checked with your unit?
- If I give you some names,

38:10.221 --> 38:12.221
would you be able to look up
their phone numbers?

38:12.223 --> 38:15.358
- We don't give out that information.
- Hey, Sanchez.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.027
Hey, Sanchez, is that you?

38:18.029 --> 38:21.698
- Oh, shit, Sanchez.
- Yo, man. How you been?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.833
I've been fantastic, brother.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.169
Couldn't be better.
How about you?

38:26.171 --> 38:27.269
I just got in this morning.

38:27.271 --> 38:29.672
Got in this morning,
huh, devil dog?

38:29.674 --> 38:31.975
Look at you, man. Come on!

38:31.977 --> 38:33.042
Come on! Give me a hug!

38:33.044 --> 38:35.144
Come on, man!

38:38.983 --> 38:41.050
Guys, I served with this guy.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.653
Huh? How about that?
I served with this guy.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.156
Hey, listen, I'm going
through some shit right now.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.727
You came to the right place.

38:50.729 --> 38:54.097
Psychologically, I'm scarred
and emotionally drained.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.197
Fuck medicine.

38:55.199 --> 38:57.000
Weed and alcohol numbs the pain

38:57.002 --> 39:00.303
as I sit with regrets
all up in my medulla,

39:00.305 --> 39:03.373
wishing that I never shook
the hands of that recruiter.

39:03.375 --> 39:07.844
When I got back, I thought
I'd have no problems,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.747
but I did.

39:10.749 --> 39:14.217
Now I'm back on probation,

39:14.219 --> 39:16.219
and they made me come here.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.124
You're not gonna go?

39:22.826 --> 39:23.926
All right, fuck it.

39:23.928 --> 39:26.229
Uh, my name's Berto

39:26.231 --> 39:27.964
and I'm here
because I got injured

39:27.966 --> 39:30.700
and I got diagnosed with PTSD

39:30.702 --> 39:32.802
and you know how it goes,
blahdy blahdy blahdy,

39:32.804 --> 39:35.338
but fuck it,
let's cut to the chase.

39:35.340 --> 39:38.041
I'm just very excited,
I'm very excited tonight.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.842
It is extra extra special,

39:39.844 --> 39:43.946
'cause my friend here,
my mellow,

39:43.948 --> 39:46.683
my main man is here
with us tonight.

39:46.685 --> 39:49.919
And he ain't just
any other guy to me.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.389
He saved my life, word to god.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.359
He's a really good man
right here.

39:56.361 --> 39:59.228
Would you like to introduce
yourself to the group?

40:01.699 --> 40:03.332
My name is Nelson.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.368
Come on, speak up, sergeant!

40:05.370 --> 40:06.769
Nelson.

40:06.771 --> 40:07.837
What's up, Nelson?

40:07.839 --> 40:09.072
Nelson.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.810
Would you like to tell us a little bit
about what brought you here tonight?

40:14.812 --> 40:17.013
I think I'm in the wrong place.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.715
It's just a place to talk.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.850
Come on, man,
we're all here for you.

40:20.852 --> 40:21.951
Right?

40:21.953 --> 40:23.786
Yup, yup.

40:24.988 --> 40:26.255
When did you get back?

40:26.257 --> 40:27.323
Today.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.158
Well, how's that been?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.260
I'm fine.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.929
Coming home can be
a difficult transition.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.129
Easy, easy, easy, easy, man.

40:34.131 --> 40:36.866
Come on, Sanchez.
Relax, buddy. Relax, man.

40:36.968 --> 40:40.470
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.138
You're more than welcome
to just sit

40:42.140 --> 40:44.040
and hold the space for others.

40:46.076 --> 40:48.177
What's on your mind?

40:52.015 --> 40:54.851
I did something.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.053
Do you wanna talk about that?

41:01.425 --> 41:03.893
No one in here
is going to judge you.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.901
It's like...
As soon as you need help

41:11.903 --> 41:14.103
your peoples forget about you.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.807
Because of what
we've been through,

41:17.809 --> 41:20.209
we know what it means
to be brothers,

41:20.211 --> 41:21.878
to have each others
backs, right?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.880
Yeah, yeah.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.414
I mean, I know
you don't know me,

41:25.416 --> 41:27.784
but I'm speaking
to you as a marine.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.584
I need some people
to fight with me tonight.

41:29.586 --> 41:31.087
- Uh, Nelson...
- I mean straight up,

41:31.089 --> 41:32.587
there's some people
trying to kill me,

41:32.589 --> 41:34.087
but all they know
is this hood shit.

41:34.089 --> 41:35.991
They nothing compared
to what we trained to do.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.960
- Nelson.
- Yes, ma'am,

41:37.962 --> 41:40.429
is your life in danger?

41:40.431 --> 41:42.832
Is someone trying to hurt you?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.834
- We need to call the police.
- I can't do that.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.969
- I can.
- No, no, no, no, don't do that.

41:46.971 --> 41:49.372
Hey, hey, joy.
Yo, yo, I got your back.

41:49.374 --> 41:51.174
He doesn't need the cops.
He needs soldiers.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.274
You're soldiers, right?
Come on, that's all we know

41:53.276 --> 41:55.210
how to fucking do in
this world is be soldiers.

41:55.212 --> 41:56.479
Come on, let's step up.

41:56.481 --> 41:59.415
Come on, come on. Gulf war, '91.

42:02.085 --> 42:04.387
Korea, what's you
gonna do, baby?

42:04.389 --> 42:06.122
Come on, man.

42:06.124 --> 42:09.125
Y'all brothers.
Semper fi, do or die.

42:09.127 --> 42:10.993
- One shot. One kill.
- - Roberto. Roberto!

42:10.995 --> 42:12.595
Ready to die. Never will.

42:12.597 --> 42:14.197
Rough, tough, can't get enough!

42:14.199 --> 42:16.599
Berto! I know this
is your friend...

42:16.601 --> 42:18.434
You don't know shit, joy.
You don't know shit.

42:18.436 --> 42:21.437
Let me tell you something,
when I got blown up,

42:21.439 --> 42:23.439
this man right here,
he came in and got me.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.575
That ass put everything
on the line for me, all right?

42:25.577 --> 42:27.543
- I understand that.
- Oh, understand this, joy.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.313
My ball sack
got blown off, okay?

42:30.315 --> 42:32.615
I almost lost all my shit, okay?

42:34.351 --> 42:36.219
I can't walk, guys, I can't run,

42:36.221 --> 42:37.954
but I'll tell you one thing,

42:37.956 --> 42:40.423
I can fuck. Believe that.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.959
- I can get a bitch to suck my dick.
- Oh, Berto.

42:42.961 --> 42:46.429
I can get a bitch
to ride my shit today

42:46.431 --> 42:48.130
because of this man right here.

42:48.132 --> 42:50.066
I owe him every fucking thing.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.101
And if I have another kid,
guess what, dead up,

42:52.103 --> 42:53.870
I'm gonna name him
Nelson Sanchez.

42:53.872 --> 42:56.005
Even if she's a fat
little girl, you got that?

42:56.007 --> 42:58.241
So who's ready to rock with us?

42:59.309 --> 43:01.244
Who's ready to roll?

43:18.028 --> 43:20.229
What the fuck is this shit
I'm hearing that none of you

43:20.231 --> 43:21.429
are fighting with my brother?

43:21.431 --> 43:22.965
Yo, Angie,
you need to calm down.

43:22.967 --> 43:25.065
- What did you say to me?
- I ain't got no problems

43:25.067 --> 43:27.265
- with you, all right?
- You all got a problem with me.

43:27.267 --> 43:29.005
Yo, you in my shop, girl.
You need to relax.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.372
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

43:30.374 --> 43:32.174
- Oh, I'm in your shop?
- Yeah.

43:32.176 --> 43:34.010
- I'm in your shop.
- Yeah, you are.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.645
I need to relax in your shop?

43:35.647 --> 43:37.680
I think it would be best
if you get the fuck out...

43:37.682 --> 43:39.181
Oh, what the fuck?

43:39.183 --> 43:40.917
That's how I relax in your shop.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.017
Angie, for real, chill out.

43:42.019 --> 43:44.453
You all need to listen to me
and listen to me good,

43:44.455 --> 43:46.489
'cause I will cut every one
of you motherfuckers.

43:46.491 --> 43:48.524
Shut the fuck up, Angie.

43:48.526 --> 43:50.493
Ow!

43:50.495 --> 43:52.028
Yo, this bitch just cut me.

43:52.030 --> 43:53.996
Who else wants some?

43:56.033 --> 43:57.500
Oh, hell no.

44:00.037 --> 44:04.140
Let me find out you sitting up
in here with these punks.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.009
Yo, Ange, it ain't
what you think.

44:07.011 --> 44:09.612
I'll tell you what I think,

44:09.614 --> 44:12.581
that's what the fuck I think!

44:12.583 --> 44:15.117
Out of all these bitches
in here, you should be

44:15.119 --> 44:17.386
the first one jumping up
to fight with Nelson.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.055
I know, but Nelly
be acting all selfish.

44:19.057 --> 44:20.155
Don't say shit to me,

44:20.157 --> 44:24.293
you two-faced snake ass
phony motherfucker.

44:24.295 --> 44:26.696
You fucking Judas.

44:26.698 --> 44:28.364
No, you worse than Judas.

44:28.366 --> 44:31.968
At least Judas ain't
grow up with Jesus.

44:36.974 --> 44:38.741
After all Nelson did for you.

44:47.684 --> 44:49.986
What the fuck you looking at?

44:52.155 --> 44:53.522
Excuse you?

44:56.393 --> 44:59.462
I'm really not trying
to get arrested today,

44:59.464 --> 45:02.598
so I suggest you
don't say shit to me.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.568
Nelson did what he did.

45:06.570 --> 45:08.504
He's a grown-ass man.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.509
I would love to just draw
on your face right now.

45:26.456 --> 45:29.125
That's what I thought.

45:43.607 --> 45:46.142
So what do you want to do?
How do you want to play this?

45:46.144 --> 45:48.477
Do you wanna go straight
or do you wanna not go head on

45:48.479 --> 45:50.277
and just hit them
when they least expect it?

45:50.279 --> 45:52.715
- What do you wanna do?
- I gotta go do some things.

45:52.717 --> 45:53.915
All right, come on, let's go.

45:53.917 --> 45:58.453
Nah, I gotta handle
a few things on my own.

45:58.590 --> 45:59.689
Okay.

45:59.690 --> 46:02.558
But I'll let you know
when I need you.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.326
Yeah, all right.
You got my number?

46:04.328 --> 46:07.563
- I'll find you.
- I bet.

46:07.565 --> 46:10.199
I appreciate you
holding me down like that.

46:10.201 --> 46:12.334
Dude, you know
I'd do anything for you, bro.

46:12.336 --> 46:13.734
- I know.
- I got your back, baby.

46:13.736 --> 46:16.839
- I know, you the man.
- No, no, man, you the man,

46:16.841 --> 46:19.075
you the man.

46:25.315 --> 46:26.782
Yo, captain.

46:28.185 --> 46:29.618
What, sarge?

46:31.655 --> 46:34.156
You killed anyone out there?

46:35.258 --> 46:38.094
You know, I'm not sure.

46:38.096 --> 46:40.529
I shot at some motherfuckers
that ended up dead,

46:40.531 --> 46:43.699
but we was all
shooting at them, you know?

46:45.168 --> 46:47.803
You still think about that shit?

46:47.805 --> 46:51.607
I try not to, bro. I try not to.

47:40.757 --> 47:42.791
What are you doing back here?

47:42.793 --> 47:46.195
Just making sure
you get on the road.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.230
We're about to be.

47:48.232 --> 47:49.330
You know this one,

47:49.332 --> 47:52.600
she wants to grab
everything in the house.

47:52.636 --> 47:54.170
Where's Livvy?

47:54.172 --> 47:55.838
She went home.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.306
She mad at me?

47:57.308 --> 47:58.908
What do you think?

48:00.744 --> 48:03.512
Will you stop by?
Make sure she's good?

48:06.183 --> 48:08.651
I spoke to Maurice.

48:08.653 --> 48:10.286
For what?

48:10.954 --> 48:12.421
Go talk to him.

48:12.423 --> 48:14.456
I'd rather not.

48:14.458 --> 48:17.359
Just see what he has to say.

48:17.361 --> 48:19.195
I'm the one who messed up.

48:19.197 --> 48:21.697
That was a long time ago.

48:23.633 --> 48:25.968
I killed somebody, Ange.

48:28.905 --> 48:31.240
I know what you did.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.379
What's up, baby girl?

48:37.381 --> 48:38.914
You ready for your trip?

48:40.350 --> 48:42.785
Hey, it's all good.

48:42.787 --> 48:45.254
You know your uncle's
good, all right?

48:45.256 --> 48:46.956
I'm not going.

48:46.958 --> 48:49.458
- Daiza, look at me.
- No!

48:49.460 --> 48:51.627
- Daiza, let's go.
- No!

48:51.629 --> 48:53.696
Everything's gonna be fine.

48:53.698 --> 48:56.765
When this is over, I'm gonna
take you to six flags.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.602
We're gonna go to six flags
together, okay?

48:59.604 --> 49:01.403
Okay.

49:05.642 --> 49:08.911
Let's go, already. Your uncle
ain't got time for this.

49:08.913 --> 49:10.980
Don't make me break out
the tickle monster,

49:10.982 --> 49:13.349
'cause I will.

49:13.351 --> 49:14.950
A'ight, too late.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.721
So you're not ticklish no more?

49:18.723 --> 49:20.923
We find out you're a robot.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.826
Hey.

49:26.296 --> 49:28.397
Asshole.

49:57.460 --> 50:00.829
Do you know the difference
between a dove and a pigeon?

50:02.532 --> 50:04.300
There is no difference.

50:05.635 --> 50:09.438
One represents love and peace,

50:09.440 --> 50:12.574
and the other is likened
to a rat with wings.

50:17.514 --> 50:19.548
What you're telling me
is very unfortunate.

50:19.550 --> 50:22.051
I really didn't want
to come bother you.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.353
Nonsense, Nelson,
you're no bother.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.588
I'm saying, everyone knows you.

50:26.590 --> 50:27.688
Respects you.

50:27.690 --> 50:30.926
Maybe you could set up a meeting
between me and Nicky?

50:30.928 --> 50:33.662
- A meeting?
- Like a sit-down.

50:36.566 --> 50:40.469
What if Nicky doesn't
want to sit with you?

50:40.471 --> 50:43.706
Or not even that, maybe just
putting the word out there

50:43.708 --> 50:45.407
that you're standing
by me on this

50:45.409 --> 50:48.477
might be enough
to scare them off.

50:48.479 --> 50:49.778
You really flatter me.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.780
It's true, though.

50:58.755 --> 51:01.023
It would be my great pleasure
to do this for you.

51:01.025 --> 51:02.925
That would be amazing.

51:03.793 --> 51:05.561
But I won't.

51:07.364 --> 51:09.832
- You won't?
- No.

51:09.834 --> 51:11.066
You're not gonna help me.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.701
No, I'm not.

51:12.703 --> 51:15.704
Because I care about you.

51:15.706 --> 51:18.674
I care about the man
that you are,

51:18.676 --> 51:20.743
about the man that you will be.

51:22.445 --> 51:26.014
Bro, you're in
a beautiful place right now.

51:28.685 --> 51:30.786
I don't understand.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.488
You will.

51:34.057 --> 51:38.494
- I don't know what to do.
- And yet here you are.

51:38.496 --> 51:41.096
- I didn't want to shoot that kid.
- I know.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.932
I mean, I did what
I thought I had to do,

51:43.934 --> 51:46.001
but that's not me.

51:46.003 --> 51:48.404
Then who are you, Nelson? Hmm?

51:50.440 --> 51:53.709
I don't fucking know.

51:53.711 --> 51:57.713
I've done a lot
of shit, you know,

51:57.715 --> 52:00.549
but that was
the only thing that...

52:03.186 --> 52:05.454
I wish I had never been there.

52:07.457 --> 52:10.826
That was that one thing
that really fucked me up.

52:13.062 --> 52:15.130
I had a gun in my hand out here,

52:15.132 --> 52:17.099
they put a gun
in my hand out there.

52:17.101 --> 52:18.801
It keeps coming. I say stop.

52:18.803 --> 52:19.968
It won't stop.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.904
I don't want none of this.

52:24.007 --> 52:26.141
It's okay to cry.

52:35.218 --> 52:37.820
So what I do now?

52:43.159 --> 52:45.727
You'll know what to do.

53:56.032 --> 53:58.166
Hey, yo, I figured it out.

53:58.168 --> 54:00.936
- I got you, son.
- You got me?

54:00.938 --> 54:03.639
I got you this bike, so you can
get the fuck up outta here.

54:03.641 --> 54:05.073
- You feel me?
- I'm not going.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.776
But look, so...

54:07.778 --> 54:09.044
Look how she rides.

54:09.046 --> 54:11.079
Handles turns and everything.

54:12.081 --> 54:13.949
I got your back.

54:13.951 --> 54:16.251
I even got you this backpack.

54:17.954 --> 54:21.089
I got you some energy bars,

54:21.091 --> 54:24.560
fruit, a couple of fresh teas,

54:24.562 --> 54:27.229
I even stole my girl's
dad's e-z pass.

54:29.165 --> 54:30.766
Just try it.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.067
Ride the block once.

54:32.069 --> 54:34.336
You're not hearing me, though.

54:34.338 --> 54:37.139
Ain't nobody gonna see you
less than what you is, kid.

54:37.141 --> 54:39.942
You don't got prove
yourself to nobody.

54:39.944 --> 54:41.577
Come on, man,
ride the block once.

54:41.579 --> 54:42.744
- Give it a try.
- I'm sorry.

54:42.746 --> 54:44.279
- Hey, get on.
- No!

54:44.281 --> 54:47.249
Yo, Nelly...

54:47.251 --> 54:50.218
I don't care who you is,

54:50.220 --> 54:51.318
you getting on this bike

54:51.320 --> 54:53.322
and you're getting
the fuck up outta here.

54:53.324 --> 54:55.824
Get outta my face, Tey.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.659
If you don't get on this bike,

54:57.661 --> 54:59.261
you and me gonna have problems.

54:59.263 --> 55:01.096
You a funny dude, man.

55:01.098 --> 55:02.297
Get off me, Tey.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.366
Let me do this for you!

55:05.835 --> 55:07.903
Let me make this right!

55:12.275 --> 55:15.811
I put you in that spot.

55:15.813 --> 55:18.380
I made this whole mess, man.

55:20.383 --> 55:23.619
I'm sorry, yo.

55:23.621 --> 55:25.253
I'm sorry.

55:28.191 --> 55:30.359
This ain't on you.

55:33.763 --> 55:35.931
They gonna kill you, Nelly.

56:03.726 --> 56:05.427
Yo, cut me up.

56:07.897 --> 56:10.198
What, for real?

57:08.057 --> 57:09.391
I'll be right back.

57:09.393 --> 57:11.126
What about me?

57:12.462 --> 57:14.329
You stay here.

57:23.806 --> 57:25.407
You got a ride to the station?

57:25.409 --> 57:27.409
Yeah, I'm all set.

57:28.945 --> 57:31.179
We're about to get on the road.

57:31.181 --> 57:33.115
How long you guys
gonna be out of town?

57:33.117 --> 57:35.450
I don't know. A few days.

57:38.187 --> 57:41.890
I can't take
much more of this shit.

57:41.892 --> 57:45.160
We just buried Daiza's
father last year.

57:49.031 --> 57:54.803
Listen, I know when Nelson
first brought you around,

57:54.805 --> 57:57.272
- I wasn't the nicest person.
- That's all right.

57:57.274 --> 57:59.808
I know it's all right.
Let me finish.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.543
Okay.

58:04.280 --> 58:07.048
Nelson's my baby brother,

58:07.050 --> 58:10.485
so I was very protective of him.

58:10.487 --> 58:14.022
It's been hard to let go,

58:14.024 --> 58:16.158
but I see how much he loves you,

58:16.160 --> 58:18.560
and I think of you like family.

58:19.862 --> 58:21.463
Thanks, Ange.

58:24.567 --> 58:29.471
No matter what happens tonight,

58:29.473 --> 58:31.807
you'll always be family.

58:36.546 --> 58:38.480
Daiza?

58:41.217 --> 58:42.250
Daiza!

58:52.528 --> 58:54.162
What are you doing here?

58:54.164 --> 58:55.330
I'm holding down.

58:55.332 --> 58:56.498
Where's Angie?

58:56.500 --> 58:57.532
Don't worry about that.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.467
You can't be here.

58:59.469 --> 59:00.569
Whoa.

59:00.571 --> 59:02.137
I'll cut a nigga real quick.

59:02.139 --> 59:03.237
Give me that.

59:03.239 --> 59:04.339
I fight boys all the time.

59:04.341 --> 59:05.874
- Give me the knife.
- No.

59:05.876 --> 59:06.908
- Let it go.
- Come on!

59:06.910 --> 59:08.977
Let go of the knife.

59:11.514 --> 59:14.015
Hold this.

59:14.017 --> 59:15.917
Yo! What the fuck, Nelson?

59:15.919 --> 59:18.053
Come on, put me down, please!

59:18.055 --> 59:19.187
Come on! I can help!

59:19.189 --> 59:20.622
Nelson!

59:20.624 --> 59:22.090
I'll fight for you!

59:22.092 --> 59:23.190
Let me help you!

59:23.192 --> 59:25.626
- Please!

59:27.430 --> 59:29.865
Fuck you, Nelson. This is not...

59:29.867 --> 59:32.100
No matter what happens
don't let her out.

59:32.102 --> 59:33.935
Okay.

59:33.937 --> 59:35.537
You're not gonna
leave me in here!

59:38.075 --> 59:39.541
Your word.

59:39.543 --> 59:41.442
Nah, nah, nah, you don't
gotta pay me nothing.

59:41.444 --> 59:42.810
Please, Nelson!

59:42.812 --> 59:45.146
- You sure?

59:45.148 --> 59:47.883
I'll charge you
for the next one.

59:47.885 --> 59:50.252
You all right, Rubio.

59:51.496 --> 59:52.555
You, too, Nelly.

59:52.556 --> 59:58.660
Port authority will be
arriving on time.

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:14.329
Last bus to Boston,
now boarding.

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.599
Last bus to Boston.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.481
Oh!

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:08.750
Fuck!

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:15.057
Ah!

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:19.927
Shh. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.789
Can I get a double
shot of Henny?

01:05:49.878 --> 01:05:52.413
Let's go, man.

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.649
It's a quiet night, right?

01:06:03.325 --> 01:06:07.028
Dawg, you look
like you need a drink.

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.964
You need a drink?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.834
I got you.

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:14.902
Whatever he's drinking,
get him another one.

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:17.005
He's not drinking.

01:06:20.909 --> 01:06:24.779
What's up?
You having girl problems?

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:26.547
Me, too.

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:30.985
My girl just broke up with me.

01:06:38.827 --> 01:06:41.996
We was gonna have kids
together and everything.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.534
But I wouldn't want my kids
growing up like we did.

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.972
I know you out here
looking for me.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:53.341
I'm sorry about your brother.

01:06:57.746 --> 01:06:59.580
Don't talk about my brother.

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:06.487
You don't say shit
about my brother.

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.097
I'm sorry for what I did.

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.354
Do we have to do this?

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.989
No!

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.945
Livvy...

01:08:06.648 --> 01:08:07.982
Take it easy.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.551
You gotta get outta here.

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.921
Olivia.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.960
Walk away.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:57.131
Go.

01:09:11.846 --> 01:09:14.148
I guess we're not breaking up.

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:18.553
Girls are crazy, huh?

01:09:19.888 --> 01:09:22.055
You know what I mean.

01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:24.125
I could tell
you know what I mean.

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:32.233
I wish it didn't have
to be this way.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.212
I don't want this.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.953
Do what you feel.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.638
Time to go, mama.

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.888
Are we still going to Edwin's?

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.325
You don't get to speak to me.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:46.394
You're on punishment forever.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:37.478
Are you hungry?

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:40.448
Mm-hmm.

01:14:40.842 --> 01:14:43.878
This is all we got.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.080
Did you get a haircut?

01:14:47.305 --> 01:14:53.640
