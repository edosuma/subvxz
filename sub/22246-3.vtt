Excuse me. May I?

[woman] How's your family?

03:55.401 --> 03:57.779
[Tench] Since when do you care
about any of that?

Dr. Wendy Carr, my partner Holden Ford.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.539
Dr. Carr.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.334
Agent Ford. I've read a lot about you.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.336
-About me?
-Your notes.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.837
Uh, thank you.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.590
Okay, um, let's go to my office.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.178
[Carr]  I'm glad this worked out.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.806
When you sent me your notes
from the Kemper meetings,

04:24.889 --> 04:26.557
I was in a real rut with my new book.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.477
-What's your book about?
-It's about white-collar criminals,

04:29.560 --> 04:31.312
men not so different
to your Edmund Kemper.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.148
How do you think the men you study
are similar to Edmund Kemper?

04:34.232 --> 04:37.151
Well, first of all,
they're all psychopaths.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.362
I study captains of industry:

04:39.445 --> 04:42.615
IBM, MGM, Ford, Exxon, you name it.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.952
And sure, these men all have
wives, kids, dogs, goldfish,

04:46.035 --> 04:48.579
but not because they stopped
being psychopaths,

04:48.663 --> 04:50.915
but because they just had
different leanings.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.543
But you think they have the same
underlying personality traits?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.837
Well, Kemper shows
a total lack of remorse,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.089
a lack of inner emotional structure,

04:58.172 --> 05:00.967
no ability to reflect
on the experience of others.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.469
-You saw this in my notes?
-It would've been clearer

05:03.553 --> 05:06.264
if you'd recorded and transcribed
your interviews verbatim,

05:06.347 --> 05:07.640
but yeah.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.435
Although your project
is obviously in the nascent stages,

05:10.518 --> 05:13.313
it already feels like a clear successor
to  The Mask of Sanity,

05:13.396 --> 05:15.356
which, as you know,
is quite a compliment.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.233
Repeat that?  The Mask of...

05:17.317 --> 05:19.152
[Tench] So you're saying
you don't think this,

05:19.235 --> 05:22.155
us interviewing these killers, is crazy?

05:22.238 --> 05:23.323
[Carr] Just the opposite.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.784
I mean, crazy in the way that anyone
with a truly new idea is crazy.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
-But no.
-Wow, okay.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.122
That's a relief.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.458
That hasn't really been the feedback
we've gotten so far.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.002
Actually, this is the only feedback
we've gotten so far.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.212
Well, these men are just sitting here,
locked up.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.423
And we're too afraid of the morality of it

05:40.506 --> 05:42.592
to see the far-reaching value
of their insights.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.677
Far-reaching in law enforcement?

05:44.761 --> 05:48.890
Into behavioral science, early detection,
criminology, you name it.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.476
Oh, yes, yes. This is what
I've been saying the whole time.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.560
Oh, have you?

05:52.643 --> 05:55.063
[Carr] You need to put this
on a more formal footing.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.814
It's gonna take a lot of time and energy

05:56.898 --> 06:00.443
to expand it into a larger project
with a specific questionnaire.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.195
Their family histories,

06:02.278 --> 06:04.489
what their thoughts were
on why they did it,

06:04.572 --> 06:07.658
when they were aroused
during the killings, that sort of thing.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.578
Then contrast, compare, and publish.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.496
Publish?

06:11.579 --> 06:14.165
[Carr] Well, you can't just circulate
your findings within the FBI.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.292
-I mean, maybe even turn it into a book.
-A book?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.878
Whoa.
We appreciate the vote of confidence,

06:18.961 --> 06:21.339
but we weren't allowed
to send you those notes.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.342
-We can't publicize what we're doing.
-[Carr] Why not?

06:24.425 --> 06:26.302
[Tench] Our department head
gave us weekends only

06:26.385 --> 06:27.887
and an office in the basement.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.389
We still have students,
we have Road School full-time.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.350
-We can't just drop everything--
-Road School?

06:32.433 --> 06:35.436
We travel around the country
and teach FBI techniques to cops.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.230
-Oh.
-We're seeing Benjamin Miller

06:37.313 --> 06:38.523
in Bridgewater this afternoon.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.567
Road School is what gives us the freedom
to go out and interview these guys.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.194
We can go bit by bit.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.196
Kemper and Miller
and build out from there.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.031
Make a study in our free time,
like you said.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.158
I didn't realize
that this was so informal.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.329
We could make it formal.
We can do that easily. And then a book.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.872
The successor to  The Mask of--

06:54.956 --> 06:57.416
I guess I just wanted to get
another set of eyes,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.795
see if you thought this was valuable
from an academic standpoint.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.341
Have you shown your Kemper notes
to your department head?

07:06.926 --> 07:07.885
No.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.304
Teaching police departments,
can someone else do that?

07:10.388 --> 07:13.141
-Anyone can, it's really not that hard.
-That is not true,

07:13.224 --> 07:14.559
and it's beside the point.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.686
Shepard doesn't even want us
to talk about this.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.022
You really think he's going to say yes
to a full-time academic study?

07:20.106 --> 07:20.940
Never mind a book?

07:24.026 --> 07:27.071
You think people would be interested
in this outside of law enforcement?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.283
I mean, imagine,

07:30.366 --> 07:34.704
like truly imagine what it takes
to bludgeon someone to death.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.665
The lust for control,

07:37.748 --> 07:39.667
the feeling of arousal,

07:39.750 --> 07:42.920
the decision to rape the severed head
of your victim,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.298
to humiliate her corpse.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.886
How could you possibly get that
from an ordinary police report?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.973
You know why it took me nearly a decade
to publish my book?

07:54.390 --> 07:57.310
Because narcissists
don't go to the doctor.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.438
Psychopaths are convinced
that there is nothing wrong with them.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.982
So these men
are virtually impossible to study.

08:03.065 --> 08:08.112
Yet you have found a way to study them
in near perfect laboratory conditions.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.824
That's what make this so exciting
and potentially so far-reaching.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.535
It's not that I disagree.
I've spent enough time with Holden

08:14.619 --> 08:17.163
that I know what it means
when he gets that crazy look.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.583
I'm afraid it's just not feasible
within the bureaucracy of the FBI.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.753
We've got weekends.
We've got the evenings after Road School,

08:23.836 --> 08:26.797
an hour or so before Road School.
We don't have to tell Shepard.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.592
Interviewing 40 men across the States
is a full-time job.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.053
And if you want this to be
a legitimate academic study,

08:32.136 --> 08:34.305
then you're looking
at four, maybe five years.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.390
-And compiling, analyzing the data.
-Right.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.894
[laughs] Well...

08:42.063 --> 08:43.064
It's a shame.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.693
We have an interview with Miller
in an hour and it's a bit of a drive.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.657
You know, this is really important work.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.367
If your boss won't let you do it,

08:54.450 --> 08:57.370
then you should talk to someone
who has the freedom and resources to--

08:57.453 --> 08:59.121
[Tench] We'll stick with it for now.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.707
It'll be slow going,
but we're not ready to give up yet.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.959
Of course not.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.337
But it's good to get some encouragement,
even if our hands are tied.

09:07.004 --> 09:07.838
Thank you.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.632
It's a pleasure.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.635
-What if--
-Don't.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.136
-I'm just saying we could--
-Holden.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.641
Look, I'm frustrated too.

09:21.352 --> 09:25.648
You know, they shoot the birds in the yard
because they might be smuggling in drugs.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.987
Actually, I don't know if that's true.
A girlfriend told me once.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.573
-You date a lot of ex-cons?
-No.

09:34.991 --> 09:38.828
Actually, Debbie's the first girl
I've really dated-dated since high school.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.580
-Dated-dated.
-Yeah.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.746
Thanks for doing this, Doctor.
We realize it's somewhat unorthodox.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.040
Unfortunately,
Miller says he won't talk to you.

10:24.123 --> 10:28.252
Now, we told him in advance and he agreed,
but there's really nothing we can do now.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.963
-He should be in a better mood tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.632
Well, he gets like this sometimes.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.343
Just needs a cool-off period
before he can interact with people.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.262
We have to bring him food into his cell
because he won't come out.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.431
We're headed out tonight.
We can't come in tomorrow.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.434
I'm sorry.
Will you be back to Boston another time?

10:44.435 --> 10:45.519
Perhaps.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.563

We appreciate it.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.648
Of course.

-Your closet.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.228
I just can't stop thinking
about this project.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.438
Dr. Carr said it could have
far-reaching consequences.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.024
Why are you up? Did you smoke my pot?

11:32.108 --> 11:35.528
I can't stop thinking about this project.

11:38.948 --> 11:39.949
Okay.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.828
Just don't wake me up
when you come back to bed.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.038
Rissell's an hour or so away,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.207
so we don't have to do Road School
to get to him.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.877
There's, uh... Vaughn Greenwood.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.588

-Yeah, he's in California.

-Uh...

12:03.347 --> 12:04.181
Yeah.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.601
I like teaching the Midwest cops.

There's always Richard Speck in Illinois.

-Great, we can do a Midwest sweep.
-Gerard John Schaefer.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.568
He killed at least 30, they think.
That was in Florida, though.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.486

-Hey, Roy. What can I do for you?

-Can I get you guys back out here?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.843
Okay. Let me get back to you.

-What's up?
-Carver.

An old lady was just murdered.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.988
We can talk to Kemper again.

Did she have a dog?
Please tell me there's a dog.

What we're calling it
when they kill three or more.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.390
Is this a new classification?
Need to get a steno to put it in writing.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.892
You bet. I'll talk to Marge.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.394
This is what you were talking about
with the Kemper thing?

13:32.478 --> 13:35.481
We briefed them with a description.
We need to make sure they bring him in.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.359
-It's what we predicted.
-Thank you, Holden. I've been listening.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.779
-[Tench] We have to make this right.
-I agree. You do now.

You got a plane to catch.

[Carver]  Name was Laura Conway.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.309
Living literally half a mile away,
practically up the street.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.437
Same thing exactly, same time of night
that Rosemary Gonzales was attacked,

14:15.521 --> 14:16.480
about 10:30 or 11:00.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.523
What about the dog?

14:17.606 --> 14:20.985
A dog like that must've put up a fight.
Your unsub will have bite marks.

14:21.777 --> 14:22.945
The dog's fucking lasagna.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.405
We rousted a bunch of kids,

14:24.488 --> 14:27.616
had an 18-year-old from the neighborhood
we liked, but he had an alibi.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.410
-What was it?
-He's a fry cook.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.037
Clocked in till midnight,
his coworkers vouch for him.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.581
You spoke to his boss?

14:33.664 --> 14:35.958
Yeah, one of these new burger joints.
Big corporate set up.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.251
Like McDonald's?

14:37.334 --> 14:39.670
-Actually, I don't remember.
-We might have to rethink.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.213
Look at that dog.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.718
Someone had a good fucking grip on it,
damn near eviscerated.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.555
Now this woman wasn't as frail
as Mrs. Gonzales.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.807
Whoever did this wasn't easily scared off.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.227
-Older.
-And determined.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.563
[Carver] I don't understand
the sexual assault part.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.399
-Why just groping? Why not rape her?
-Because he didn't want to.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.860
He just wanted to dominate
and humiliate her.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.113
-[exhales] That's one sick son of a bitch.
-Supposing he's 35, 40.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.365
Supposing these women
are his mom's age...

15:08.449 --> 15:10.993
-It's a mom thing.
-Wait, 40? Did I just hear you correctly?

15:11.076 --> 15:13.829
-This is not a kid.
-I've been rounding up teenagers.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.498
This time wasn't as frenzied.
It's not a teenager.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.960
[sighs] Sacramento DA reamed my ass
for hassling busboys,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.295
and you've changed your mind?

15:21.378 --> 15:24.173
It's not a one-off.
This isn't some random freak-out.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.508
-This guy is getting confident.
-At least late 20s.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.762
Physically mature. Emotionally immature.
Socially undeveloped.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.431
-Possibly still lives at home.
-Narcotics, maybe.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.142
That's why he beat her this badly,
didn't know when to stop.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.310
-You think?
-[Tench] Why not?

15:36.393 --> 15:38.687
Not if he lives at home.
Maybe he's married.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.773
-Or separated.
-Separated?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.900
Guys in unhappy marriages
have hair triggers.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.277
They lash out.
Especially when it comes to women.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.322
-I wouldn't know anything about that.
-Lucky you.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.950
You guys still think he's white?
Not Latino? Black?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.242
[sighs]

15:52.326 --> 15:56.413
I think blacks, Latinos might be
too respectful of an elderly woman.

15:56.497 --> 16:00.125
-My bet is poor white trash.
-Listen, we did talk to some older guys.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.461
And this one right here
is pretty interesting.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.881
Just came walking up off the street.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.384
"Hey, what happened? Did anybody see?"
He'd been drinking.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.803
One of these guys who likes
talking to cops, you know.

16:14.848 --> 16:15.933
We should talk to him.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.435
Sure.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.745
-Mom.
-[car doors slam]

16:39.081 --> 16:40.082
Good morning.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.501
Do you remember me?

16:42.584 --> 16:44.086
Yeah, I remember you.

16:45.879 --> 16:46.714
Mom!

16:51.343 --> 16:52.803
Ma'am, I'm Detective Roy Carver.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.972
These are my colleagues,
Bill Tench and Holden Ford.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.557
-Hello.
-[woman] What do you want?

16:56.640 --> 16:57.766
It's Dwight, right?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.686
-What do you want with him?
-These gentlemen are with the FBI.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.689
[woman] Well, now what has he done?

17:03.772 --> 17:06.775
Who the hell have you
brought into my home?

17:07.901 --> 17:08.986
[Carver] May we come in?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.080
FBI knocking at my door.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.877
I might as well be dead for all he cares.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.671
Just kill me now
because that is what you're doing.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.506
And it is a slow death.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.302
He's my only son.
I might as well walk up to the freeway,

17:33.385 --> 17:37.431
stick my head under a truck
and save myself the misery.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.518
We'd just like to ask Dwight
a few questions.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.936
Are these yours, Dwight?

17:43.020 --> 17:47.566
You'd think he'd be out of my hair by now.
Move the fuck on, but no.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.445
-You sleep on the couch?
-When he's not too drunk to get up there.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.991
Maybe we can talk outside, Dwight.
Have a smoke.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.159
Take him.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.871
Just give me a fucking moment to breathe.

18:10.881 --> 18:11.840
Cigarette?

18:16.720 --> 18:17.846
Nice lady.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.432
Real maternal.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.816
You have a lot of friends, Dwight?

18:29.691 --> 18:30.859
Do you?

18:31.610 --> 18:32.778
[Tench sniffs]

18:32.861 --> 18:36.198
I saw a dog leash in the house,
but I don't see a dog around here.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.250
You got a girlfriend?

18:48.168 --> 18:49.670
[Tench] Must be tough
bringing a girl home,

18:49.753 --> 18:51.713
with your old lady
breathing down your neck.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.049
-No.
-[Tench] No?

18:54.633 --> 18:55.717
It's not hard?

18:56.718 --> 18:58.137
I don't have a girlfriend.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.430
Good-looking guy like you?
I don't believe you.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.267
[scoffs] You trying to suck me off?

19:03.851 --> 19:06.103
Put it this way,
you never had a girlfriend?

19:08.689 --> 19:09.857
One time.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.525
[Holden] What happened?

19:12.442 --> 19:13.735
She got pregnant.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.073
My mom decided we were too young
to get married, told her parents.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.575
[Holden] She ratted you out.

19:21.785 --> 19:22.828
What happened to the kid?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.914
-She got a scrape.
-[Holden] Scrape?

19:26.373 --> 19:27.416
Abortion.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.210
-[Holden] How old were you?
-Twenty.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.462
-How old was she?
-[Dwight] Twenty.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.966
That doesn't seem too young to me.
Did you love her?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.303
I don't know.
What kind of fucking question is that?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.555
[Holden] I'm curious. Humor me.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.807
Well, "I don't know," is the answer.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.268
Do you think she loved you?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.275
-You okay there, Dwight?
-What?

19:53.358 --> 19:55.736
Looks like you've been going
at your arm pretty good.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.280
You get in a scrap?

19:58.947 --> 20:01.283
-No. [chuckles]
-Let me see your arm.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.913
How'd you get those scratches?

20:05.996 --> 20:07.789
I get drunk. I don't know.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.791
I've never seen alcohol
give a guy scratches.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.336
I bump into things, I guess.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.378
[Tench] Like what?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.382
I got them from a piece of wood.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.385
-It's fine, I'm fine.
-Let me look at that again, Dwight.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.975
I don't have a dog.

20:28.101 --> 20:31.104
-She's the one with the dog, not me.
-[Tench] Your mom?

20:32.731 --> 20:33.565
Dwight.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.404
Why don't you tell us right now
how you got those scratches

20:39.988 --> 20:42.950
so you don't lie to an FBI agent, okay?

20:44.493 --> 20:49.122
I got them from a piece of wood.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.169
[sighs]

20:54.253 --> 20:56.755
-Is it just you and her in there?
-And Jesse.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.173
[Tench] Who's Jesse?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.591
Some guy.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.636
[coughing]

21:03.470 --> 21:05.681
-Not a big smoker?
-I smoke.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.268
Doesn't it get cramped in there,
the three of you all together?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.438
-I guess.
-Is that new? Jesse staying with you?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.942
A few weeks.

21:18.443 --> 21:22.072
They just met or whatever.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.491
-I don't know.
-[Tench] That room's close by.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.827
Is that kinda weird,
hearing your mom and her boyfriend?

21:26.910 --> 21:29.496
-No.
-[exhales] That would drive me crazy.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.206
She sounds like she's hard to please.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.042
-Does he do what she wants?
-She doesn't know what she wants.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.043
[Tench] No?

21:36.878 --> 21:41.466
Who just meets a guy,
then she moves him right in, you know?

21:41.550 --> 21:43.719
-Kind of fucking weird.
-You ever talk to her about it?

21:43.802 --> 21:44.636
What?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.722
[Holden] She made you
get an abortion with your girl.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.057
Do you get a say in her romantic life?

21:50.475 --> 21:53.979
I mean, he's living right next to you.
Do you get a say in hearing them fuck?

21:54.062 --> 21:57.566
I think that would piss me off,
if my mom told me what to do all the time.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.443
Get an abortion,
get her this, get her that.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.570
[Holden] Yeah. You let your mom
treat you like that?

22:01.653 --> 22:04.573
-[Tench] Don't you stick up for yourself?
-I stick up for myself.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.950
-Didn't hear you doing that.
-Didn't hear him say anything.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.077
I stand my ground. I'm no pussy.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.456
I'm not saying you're a pussy.
Why do you stand there and take it?

22:12.539 --> 22:15.625
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-[Holden] You ever cuss her out?

22:16.126 --> 22:18.295
-I give as good as I get.
-What does that mean?

22:18.378 --> 22:21.548
-[Holden] You ever been in a fight?
-Maybe.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.259
-But not with Mom, right? Mom's different.
-You only have one mom.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.345
Never laid a finger on her.
Didn't raise a hand, of course not.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.890
Raise a hand to your mom,
it all goes to shit, right?

22:37.898 --> 22:40.901
-You ever lost control?
-Uh-uh.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.528
-Not with her, leastways.
-[Holden] "Not with her"?

22:43.612 --> 22:46.907
[Tench] Makes sense, you need
to let off steam, show her who's boss.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.366
You'd never hurt your old lady--

22:48.450 --> 22:50.869
You'd never hurt her
because she loves you.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.629
[sobbing]

23:01.463 --> 23:03.840
[TV reporter]  Florin residents
can rest easier tonight.

23:03.924 --> 23:07.052
Sacramento Police have arrested
30-year-old Dwight Taylor

23:07.135 --> 23:10.388
in connection with a recent pair
of sadistic assaults.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.517
Police say Taylor,
himself a resident of the sleepy suburb,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.686
beat Rosemary Gonzales, 74,
into a coma,

23:16.770 --> 23:19.481
and stabbed to death Laura Conway, 64.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.733
The victims lived less than a mile apart.

23:21.817 --> 23:25.612
In a disturbing twist, after viciously
attacking his elderly victims...

23:25.695 --> 23:27.906
[all cheering, shouting]

23:32.536 --> 23:34.246
All right, all right, all right.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.958
Listen, everybody in this room
remembers when they were a little kid,

23:38.291 --> 23:40.252
when they figured out
they wanted to be a cop.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.547
I knew I wanted to be a detective
in the third grade

23:43.630 --> 23:47.050
when I read  A Study in Scarlet
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.761
Well, this guy right here?

23:50.971 --> 23:53.890
-He's the modern-day Sherlock Holmes.
-[man] Absolutely!

23:53.974 --> 23:55.142
[chatter, clapping]

23:55.225 --> 23:57.853
-And that makes you Dr. Watson.
-[laughing]

23:57.936 --> 23:59.104
Thank you.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.772
No shit.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.692
-Either that or you guys are psychic.
-[laughing]

24:03.775 --> 24:06.111
Hey, don't laugh.
There's a lot of psychics in California

24:06.194 --> 24:08.280
-and they all want to be cops.
-[all] Yeah!

24:08.363 --> 24:11.158
[Carver] All the cops want to be feds,
all the feds want to be...

24:11.241 --> 24:13.660
-I don't know what.
-[laughing]

24:13.743 --> 24:16.788
Oh! He's gonna make a speech.
Inform us, oh, wise one.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.415
-Speech!
-[all shouting]

24:18.498 --> 24:20.417
-Thank you.
-[all chanting] Speech!

24:20.500 --> 24:23.128
I just wanted to say thank you
for having this get-together.

24:23.211 --> 24:26.715
And Roy, thank you for acknowledging
what my partner Bill and I are doing.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.387
And for embracing that,
if we all work together,

24:33.388 --> 24:37.267
we can venture into the blackest night
and shine a light on the darkness.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.648
I'm talking about real darkness.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.944
-And thanks for the beer.
-[all cheering]

24:48.028 --> 24:49.446
We were happy to help.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.990
Congratulations, guys.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.491
Good work.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.577

24:57.704 --> 24:59.789
-[keys clinking]
-[sighs]

25:01.082 --> 25:03.335
If only you could
shine a light on the darkness,

25:03.418 --> 25:06.796
you could illuminate my keys.
[chuckles]

25:11.092 --> 25:13.178
Very, very funny.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.074
[Tench] Okay. You got us.

25:34.783 --> 25:35.784
Good job.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.962
[softly] Yeah, I wanted to hear
how you're doing. That's all.

25:51.716 --> 25:52.884
His teacher?

25:59.808 --> 26:00.976
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.690
No, I don't think we'll be back in time.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.236
So...

26:14.489 --> 26:17.575
Okay. I just wanted to hear your voice.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.578
Give him a kiss from Dad.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.416
Love you too.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.343
[Tench] I'm sorry, Ed,

26:35.427 --> 26:38.555
do you mean that violence in the movies
drove you to kill those women?

26:38.638 --> 26:39.597
No.

26:39.681 --> 26:43.810
My point is, in reality,
it doesn't work the way you expect.

26:43.893 --> 26:47.147
When you stab somebody,
they're supposed to fall dead.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.189
They go, "Oh..."

26:48.273 --> 26:50.608
-And they fall dead, right?
-Right.

26:50.692 --> 26:54.279
In reality, when you stab somebody,
they lose blood pressure

26:54.362 --> 26:57.615
and they leak to death very slowly.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.410
So I was reluctant, I didn't enjoy it.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.204
Did you get that on tape?

27:03.872 --> 27:04.789
Yeah.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.961
You know, it all really goes back

27:10.045 --> 27:15.258
to my perceived inability
to communicate socially, sexually.

27:16.134 --> 27:19.721
I was scared to death of failing
in male-female relationships,

27:19.804 --> 27:22.057
even sitting down to talk to a young lady.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.143
I wanted to communicate.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.897
Ironically enough,
that's why I began picking people up.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.648
I pick a girl up

27:30.732 --> 27:33.068
and I'm going a little further each time.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.153
It's a daring kind of a thing.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.447
Like, first, there wasn't a gun.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.407
Then I'm driving along,

27:39.491 --> 27:42.452
we go to a vulnerable place
where there aren't people watching,

27:42.535 --> 27:43.870
but I say, "No, I can't."

27:43.953 --> 27:46.122
So you picked up women
but didn't kill them?

27:46.206 --> 27:49.042
But then, a gun is in the car,

27:49.125 --> 27:50.877
and this craving,

27:50.960 --> 27:54.506
this awful raging, eating feeling
is inside me.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.467
I would've loved to have just raped them,

27:58.051 --> 28:00.553
but not having any experience at all,

28:01.054 --> 28:04.974
I could feel it consuming my insides,
this fantastic passion.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.935
Fantastic passion?

28:07.018 --> 28:10.271
-It's a good phrase, no?
-Then what happens?

28:10.355 --> 28:12.315
You know, I'm thinking of writing
my own book.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.360
I've been trying to get a typewriter.
Maybe help me with that?

28:15.443 --> 28:17.404
I'm sure we could pull some strings.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.280
Then it builds, the feeling?

28:19.364 --> 28:20.949
At some point, you begin to...

28:21.408 --> 28:23.243
-enjoy the thrill.
-[Ed] Look...

28:24.077 --> 28:26.204
when you slit a person's throat,

28:26.287 --> 28:28.331
you need to cut it from ear to ear

28:28.415 --> 28:31.376
in order to sever the windpipe
and the jugular

28:31.459 --> 28:33.711
so that they bleed and suffocate
at the same time.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.880
Otherwise, they'll just be
in a great deal of pain.

28:37.298 --> 28:39.718
That's how I learnt the term "ear to ear,"

28:39.801 --> 28:41.094
literally, what that meant.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.513
People think it's just an expression.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.473
It's not, it's an instruction.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.309
You don't want to. You have to.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.769
So there's no pleasure, Ed?

28:49.853 --> 28:51.104
[Ed] Sure there is.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.982
I just wanted the exaltation
over the party.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.443
In other words, winning over death.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.821
They were dead and I was alive.
That was the pleasure.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.615
I was the hunter, they were my victims.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.743
So how did you feel
after your first kills?

29:07.620 --> 29:09.831
[clears throat, sighs]

29:11.416 --> 29:13.501
I liked Mary the best.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.503
I was lukewarm on Anita.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.506
What was wrong with her?

29:19.048 --> 29:20.508
[Ed] Oh, nothing in particular.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.844
It was more that Mary was...

29:25.263 --> 29:29.058
I was really quite struck
by her personality and her looks,

29:29.142 --> 29:31.686
and there was just almost
a reverence there.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.855
-Reverence?
-Sure.

29:34.355 --> 29:36.441
Sometimes, afterward,
I visited there to be near her

29:36.524 --> 29:38.359
because I loved her and wanted her.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.278
At the murder site?

29:40.361 --> 29:42.363
I've never been much to look at myself,

29:42.447 --> 29:44.866
but I've always gone after
the pretty girls.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.034
I bet you're the same.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.620
Sure.

29:49.829 --> 29:51.539
You probably can't imagine this,

29:51.623 --> 29:54.542
but since I was locked up
from age 15 to 21

29:54.626 --> 29:56.711
for the murder of my grandparents,

29:56.795 --> 30:00.256
I was very much out of touch
with women my own age.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.344
When I got back on the street,
it was like being on a strange planet.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.555
I had been living with people
older than I was for so long,

30:07.639 --> 30:09.140
I was like an old fogy.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.809
That must have been jarring.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.727
[Ed] You know,
when I confessed to the police,

30:12.811 --> 30:16.815
they drove me through California
and we stopped by a diner for some food.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.984
Some attractive young ladies
walked by the car.

30:20.735 --> 30:21.903
I vomited.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.740
Right there and then, on the police car,
in front of all the cops.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.866
Quite violently.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.452
That was just how I reacted to women.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.912
I had no other way.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.164
Let me ask you something.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.001
Ever talk with anyone about this?

30:37.877 --> 30:39.462
About your inclinations?

30:41.297 --> 30:43.383
Your mom... maybe?

30:44.008 --> 30:46.177
Obviously,
not the way you're talking to us.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.099
If I could get a word in edgewise,

30:52.559 --> 30:54.352
everything would have been different.

30:54.435 --> 30:58.773
From the moment I woke up in the morning,
she was demeaning and belittling.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.567
And she knew all of my buttons

31:00.650 --> 31:02.026
because she put them there.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.196
I was her toy all my life,

31:05.280 --> 31:08.074
right up until the moment
I cut off her head with a hunting knife.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.703
Ed...

31:13.162 --> 31:15.206
why did you do what you did...

31:16.875 --> 31:17.959
with her head?

31:20.545 --> 31:21.963
Why does anyone?

31:23.965 --> 31:26.009
You know,
that night I walked up to her bed.

31:26.092 --> 31:30.471
She's laying there reading a paperback,
as many thousands of nights before.

31:31.598 --> 31:36.811
She says, "Oh, I suppose you're gonna
want to wait up all night and talk now."

31:38.229 --> 31:39.564
Can you believe that?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.317
"Wait up all night talking."

31:43.526 --> 31:44.569
Shit.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.240
And I knew I was gonna kill her...

31:50.158 --> 31:51.075
you know?

31:52.327 --> 31:54.662
I was honest with myself
for the first time.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.458
Because I'm not a lizard,

31:58.541 --> 32:01.920
I'm not from under a rock,
I came out of her vagina.

32:02.587 --> 32:03.796
I came out of my mother.

32:05.006 --> 32:08.426
Is it true that you put part of her
into the garbage disposal?

32:10.595 --> 32:12.013
Her vocal cords.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.848
Why?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.600
Because I couldn't shut her up.

32:16.100 --> 32:20.188
She wanted to destroy me
with words, literally.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.940
So I shut her up for good.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.319
And now, everyone knows it was
because of what she did to me,

32:26.402 --> 32:28.947
because of the way she treated her son.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.788
[keys jingling, door unlocks]

32:38.581 --> 32:39.624
Pizza!

32:40.541 --> 32:41.918
You guys.

32:44.587 --> 32:47.215
Okay. So you get out of the car...

32:47.507 --> 32:50.718
-I just walk into the apartment building.
-Anyone around?

32:50.802 --> 32:51.844
So, I'm home,

32:51.928 --> 32:54.013
walking up the stairs to our apartment

32:54.097 --> 32:57.350
with a freshly severed head draining
about a pint of blood into a duffel bag.

32:57.433 --> 33:00.103
You just got it under your arm?
Just like that?

33:00.561 --> 33:02.438
-[Tench] Take another slice.
-Thank you.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.233
Then comes this picture postcard,

33:05.316 --> 33:07.443
groovy, happy young couple on the stairs.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.238
-They walk right past me.
-Your two worlds are colliding...

33:10.321 --> 33:12.865
My murderous fantasy life and this.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.077
Pretty girl. Pretty name.
Kim or something.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.246
Going out on a date with her boyfriend.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.957
And it could just as easily
be Kim's head in that bag.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.917
-You're playing God.
-Exactly.

33:23.001 --> 33:27.588
And I realized I've never been on a date
in my entire life, ever.

33:28.172 --> 33:30.758
And I got in the door and I said to Mom,

33:30.842 --> 33:33.011
"I've never been on a date
with a girl, Mom."

33:33.094 --> 33:35.013
-[Tench] And what did she say?
-"Thank God."

33:35.096 --> 33:37.473
-Can you believe that?
-[sighs] What a bitch.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.476
That's when I started burying the heads
in the backyard.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.187
-Sure.
-Right underneath Mom's bedroom window.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.399
Their faces looking right up
at her window while she was at home.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.776
Right under her nose, man.
I couldn't help myself.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.777
What the fuck?

33:50.862 --> 33:54.323
I know it's silly, but Mom always
liked people to look up to her.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.993
-[both laugh]
-Whoa.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.464
[car starts]

34:38.159 --> 34:40.745
[Holden sniffing] Ugh!

34:40.828 --> 34:42.246
I still smell like Kemper.

34:43.539 --> 34:46.042
-Or maybe it's just CMF.
-[Tench laughs]

34:46.125 --> 34:48.920
[Tench] It did smell pretty bad,
like a locker room.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.047
[Holden] Gonna make me
lose my appetite.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.057
So...

35:02.100 --> 35:03.226
you like your mom?

35:05.103 --> 35:06.437
Sorry. Not funny.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.525
Yeah. I liked my mom.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.610
But she's not around anymore.

35:16.447 --> 35:17.698
You like your wife?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.619
-Yes, I do.
-That's good.

35:23.204 --> 35:26.666
I've known her all my life.
I'm not sure what I'd do without her.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.627
-How about that girlfriend?
-Yeah.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.547
She's great. Smart.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.674
I think she actually likes me.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.302
Sounds like we got it made.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.305
[Holden]  It feels good, doesn't it?

35:41.514 --> 35:44.475
To fly home having got the bad guy,
just like in the movies.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.395
Yeah. It feels good
that Dwight's off the street.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.605
But Kemper has a way of tempering that.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.567
He makes you sick to your stomach,
doesn't he?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.235
Yes.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.361
More than Dwight?

35:55.444 --> 35:59.323
There's nothing behind Kemper's eyes.
It's like standing near a black hole.

36:00.908 --> 36:03.786
-Right.
-And he thinks we're his friends.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.747
Well, he thinks you're his friend.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.127
Which makes you a pretty great FBI agent.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.348
I've been thinking
about our conversation with Dr. Carr.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.686
You have?

36:30.730 --> 36:32.190
We're good at this shit,

36:32.815 --> 36:34.442
even if it turns my stomach.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.195
If we're gonna take a backseat
to everything new,

36:37.278 --> 36:38.404
everything interesting...

36:38.487 --> 36:39.614
Yeah.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.074
If she really thinks
the idea is that good,

36:42.158 --> 36:45.661
that it has that much potential
to change people's lives...

36:46.871 --> 36:49.040
-Yeah?
-...maybe we should invite her down.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.001
Just for a day, to strategize.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.837
I think that's a fantastic idea.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.964
At least we could compile
what we have so far

36:57.048 --> 36:59.759
and create a plan
so if we want to talk to Shepard--

36:59.842 --> 37:01.052
So we can be prepared.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.722
It's a long shot.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.474
He hates you already.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.602
He's beginning to hate you, too.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.771
[exhales]

37:12.396 --> 37:13.397
Right.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.609
So why half-ass it?

37:18.945 --> 37:22.031
[Holden] Dwight would have kept doing it,
just like Kemper,

37:22.114 --> 37:24.450
until he finally made his way
to the source.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.662
It's kind of prosaic
that it's always the mother.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.999
It was the mother,
but in a very different way.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.126
More...

37:34.961 --> 37:36.212
love.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.880
If you can even call it that.

37:38.589 --> 37:39.674
Was she hot?

37:40.216 --> 37:41.884
-Who?
-His mom?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.803
-Ugh...
-[laughs]

37:44.971 --> 37:49.141
Guys in my high school thought my mom
was hot and it always really disgusted me.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.728
But then she went through chemo
and nobody made jokes about her anymore

37:52.812 --> 37:55.815
-and it kind of made me sad.
-I didn't know your mom had cancer.

37:56.315 --> 37:59.193
That's why I'm always asking you
to grab my boobs when we're fucking.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.781
-Make you check for cancerous lumps.
-Oh, is that why? [spits]

38:03.864 --> 38:06.075
[water running]

38:09.537 --> 38:11.789
I can't let these guys rub off on me.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.125
-The way they view sex.
-And women.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.553
Thanks for coming.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.139
I needed to see you.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.061
And now that I'm all clean...

38:37.231 --> 38:41.444
If going down on me while I'm filing
my nails is your idea of being kinky...

38:42.111 --> 38:43.237
I'm kinky.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.452
I'm very kinky.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.581
I could impale you with this nail file.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.751
Then I could be a part of your case study.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.337
You would be
a very compelling interviewee.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.106
[Holden] Hey, Kenneth,
can I ask you something?

39:19.190 --> 39:20.775
Oh, sure. What's on your mind?

39:21.025 --> 39:24.820
I've, uh, done a bit of thinking about
some of the things that we're teaching.

39:24.904 --> 39:28.032
In particular,
the list of deviant terminology.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.158
The cuss words?

39:29.241 --> 39:31.327
Right. Well, I was thinking more the...

39:32.286 --> 39:34.914
-descriptors of the acts.
-Uh...

39:34.997 --> 39:36.874
You know, fellatio, cunnilingus--

39:36.957 --> 39:39.001
Okay, what exactly is the issue?

39:39.085 --> 39:41.337
Well, that's just it, Ken.
I don't have an issue.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.756
I really don't know that they are deviant.

39:44.757 --> 39:45.800
Anal violation?

39:46.425 --> 39:47.551
Well, no, not that one.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.720
-Have you talked to Bill about this?
-Oh, sure.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.263
Bill agrees with me.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.100
And you think we should alter
the curriculum?

39:54.558 --> 39:56.936
Just... take a look at the list.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.563
-Think about it, okay?
-Mm-hmm. Hmm.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.528
-[woman] Fuckhead?
-You can keep that.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.737
Fuckbag?

40:07.279 --> 40:08.280
That, too.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.990
And we're keeping "gang bang"?

40:10.074 --> 40:11.242
What's right is right.

40:12.118 --> 40:12.993
Klismaphilia?

40:14.120 --> 40:14.954
Klisma-- what?

40:15.746 --> 40:17.748
Enemas. Either giving or having.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.835
That can stay.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.173
And we're losing "pussy," "dildo,"

40:26.757 --> 40:29.301
"fellatio," "cunnilingus."

40:29.385 --> 40:30.719
Are you sure about this?

40:30.803 --> 40:31.762
Yes.

40:31.846 --> 40:32.930
Thank you, Marge.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.433
It's for the best.

40:36.725 --> 40:37.726
All right.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.396
[Holden]  So, you and Dr. Carr go back?

40:40.980 --> 40:43.107
I consulted her
on a few cases here and there.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.693
We go back a few years. Why do you ask?

40:45.776 --> 40:46.777
Just curious.

40:50.322 --> 40:51.323
No.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.075
-No?
-You know what I mean.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.661
-I didn't mean to imply--
-I enjoy being married, thank you.

40:55.744 --> 40:56.954
I didn't mean...

40:58.789 --> 41:00.249
Just... Wendy has something.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.667
Not sexual.

41:04.044 --> 41:05.212
Maybe a little sexual.

41:05.296 --> 41:09.258
But her ideas and her energy, she...
I sound like an idiot.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.594
You sound like you have a crush
on teacher.

41:11.677 --> 41:15.014
It's just someone like her
embracing this project says something.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.934
-Don't you think?
-I get it.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.145
Old Man Tench jumps onboard, so what?

41:21.228 --> 41:23.272
Grumpy old Shepard, who cares?

41:23.355 --> 41:25.733
-But the foxy professor--
-That's not fair.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.444
[Holden] That's her.

41:33.407 --> 41:35.034
-Dr. Carr.
-Agent Ford.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.161
-[Tench] Welcome to Quantico.
-Thank you.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.704
How was your trip?

41:39.371 --> 41:42.333
It was a little dull to be honest.
I was grading papers, but--

41:42.416 --> 41:44.752
We can stop at the cafeteria for a coffee
if you like.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.754
No, I'm fine. I had some this morning.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.256
We're just this way.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.551
So what are you teaching?

41:53.344 --> 41:55.554
Um, I'm teaching a class

41:55.638 --> 41:58.098
on the intersection of sociopathy
and fame.

41:58.641 --> 42:01.727
People like, um...
Andy Warhol, Jim Morrison.

42:02.019 --> 42:05.523
Their celebrity becomes the only thing
they need to sustain their ego.

42:05.606 --> 42:08.359
-Nixon was a sociopath.
-Very similar.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.778
How do you get to be president
of the United States

42:10.861 --> 42:12.112
if you're a sociopath?

42:12.196 --> 42:15.199
The question is, how do you get to be
president of the United States

42:15.282 --> 42:17.493
-if you're not?
-[Tench laughs]

42:17.576 --> 42:21.872
That's why this work is so vital.
It goes so much further than the FBI.

42:21.956 --> 42:25.376
-[Tench] All the way to the White House.
-[Carr] Perhaps, yeah.
