to be the leader who uses
this event to rally a city,
a nation, a world.

I have a chance to
be a part of something big.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.591

You need me to leave.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.926
I need to win.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.978
You've been
going about this
all wrong, Professor.

Trying to
take on the science and
the killer all on your own?

00:25.610 --> 00:29.649
The best way to stop Sylar
is for us to work together.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.864
Hey! Hey!
No one's gonna hurt you.

you to talk to her.
MATT: Talk to who?

00:36.412 --> 00:38.027
Molly Walker,
the little girl you found.

00:38.122 --> 00:39.407
What makes you think
she's gonna talk to me?

00:39.498 --> 00:40.704
Well, if you're
really a mind reader,

00:40.791 --> 00:41.871
she won't need to.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.211
I need to borrow your Micah.

00:44.295 --> 00:45.705
Micah's off limits.

to save the world today?

are decomposing.

You need to
get her to a doctor.

restores his art.

hangs out in here.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.092
It wasn't real.

It was
all Linderman's

Linderman's just been
playing with our lives.

17:50.612 --> 17:51.692
What are you doing?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.522
Linderman
obviously isn't here.
We're wasting our time.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.981
lf Linderman knows
this much about us,

17:56.076 --> 17:57.566
he must know
something about Micah.

to stop the man
who hurt your family

to hurt you.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.690
You can't stop
the boogeyman.

18:32.529 --> 18:37.364
He sees into your soul,
and then he eats your brain.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.283
Well,
you know who can
stop the boogeyman?

18:40.370 --> 18:41.576
You.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.369
I hear you have
an amazing ability.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.663
It's not so amazing.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.083
They ask me
where people are,
and I find them.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.253
You find them? What?
Anywhere in the world?

18:52.340 --> 18:54.126
Yeah,
I just think about them,

18:54.217 --> 18:56.378
and then
I know where they are.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.800
But it doesn't
work right now.

19:04.894 --> 19:09.513
Well, that is a very
special ability, Molly.

19:09.607 --> 19:13.475
Because the boogeyman,
he likes to hide.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.856
But if you can
tell us where he is,

19:15.947 --> 19:18.814
we can make sure
he never comes back again.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.116
You're different
from the other doctors.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.911

19:26.916 --> 19:28.201
Thanks.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.373
So, you're telling me
this guy Ted Sprague
blew up your house?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.215
Yeah, pretty much.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.297
Don't you see this, Nathan?

19:43.391 --> 19:44.927
Maybe I'm not the bomb.

19:45.018 --> 19:48.010
Maybe this guy
Ted Sprague is.
Maybe we can stop him.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.356
You said you had a dream
that you blew up
New York City.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.850
Yeah,
I also dreamed
that I could fly.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.226
We know how
that turned out for you.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.933
You can fly?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.110
That's cool.

19:59.783 --> 20:02.365
Pick up the phone,
call the FBI.

We need to find him.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.451
Trust me.

You've been through a lot,
and you're very brave.

I just want you to
know that I admire that.

we have a problem.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.725
Oh, thank you, Lord,
for bringing
my Gabriel home safe.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.857

21:23.700 --> 21:25.031
Come in.

21:35.879 --> 21:39.838
If I'd known you were coming,
lwould have straightened up
more.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.791
I brought it from Texas.

For your collection.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.844
...perfect!

One more,
and l have the continent.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.425

21:53.062 --> 21:55.644
I hear it's beautiful there.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.393
Green everywhere.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.438
The clock's broken.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.520
Oh, that old thing,
I should have thrown
it away years ago.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.277
It was Dad's.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.153
It's junk.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.279
It's a beautiful piece.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.076
It just needs
a little attention.

22:30.808 --> 22:34.471
I can tell you
how proud lam.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.598
I haven't done anything.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.600
You've traveled the world.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.603
Some of us only get to
see it in snow globes.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.274
I'm tired of traveling.
I think I might stay here.

22:45.365 --> 22:48.277
ln Queens?
Why would you ever come back?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.404
If I stayed,
maybe I could stop.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.530
Maybe I wouldn't have to...

22:56.084 --> 22:57.620
What?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.086
Gabriel?

23:00.964 --> 23:03.956
I'm gonna
make you a sandwich.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.165
Do you want tuna fish?

23:05.260 --> 23:07.046
Please don't,
I'm not hungry.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.135
Well...

23:10.640 --> 23:12.551
If you insist on staying,

23:14.477 --> 23:17.184
you should call Mr. Bilger,
that man from Smith & Barney.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.307
You fixed his Rolex.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.478
Why would I call him?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.555
Because he said you should.

23:20.650 --> 23:24.518
He said you were
very talented
and very special.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.568
Maybe he could
get you a job.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.489
l have a job.
I fix watches.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.736
That's a hobby.

23:30.827 --> 23:34.536
Investment banking
is a very lucrative field.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.203
I can't be
an investment banker.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.781
You could be
anything you want.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.376
Mom, he wouldn't
even remember who I am.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.745
Who could forget you?

23:40.837 --> 23:42.577

even listening to me!

a tuna sandwich.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.168
So?
I asked you not to.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.507
I made a mistake.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.225
I'm sorry!

24:00.773 --> 24:03.560
No, Mom.
Mom, don't. Don't.
Oh, no, no. No!

24:04.611 --> 24:06.397
Don't, it's just...

24:08.197 --> 24:10.734
Maybe I don't
have to be special.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.701
That's okay to just
be a normal watchmaker.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.450
Can't you just
tell me that's enough?

24:23.838 --> 24:26.500
Why would I tell you that

24:26.591 --> 24:30.049
when I know you
could be so much more?

24:32.221 --> 24:36.681
If you wanted,
you could be president.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.853
What are we doing here?
Shouldn't we be looking
for Ted?

24:46.944 --> 24:48.480
No. The FBI and police
aren't going to believe us.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.278
They'll take
Nathan seriously, though.
He can evacuate the people.

24:51.366 --> 24:52.572

What? What? What?

my father works for.

I've been running from.

what's happening in there.

doesn't have a grasp
on the situation, Thompson.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.667
And why would
you think that?

25:09.759 --> 25:11.340
All the pundits think
I'm gonna lose.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.678

my brother tells me

25:12.762 --> 25:13.842
about a fella
named Ted Sprague.

25:13.930 --> 25:14.965
Ring a bell?

25:15.056 --> 25:16.546

25:16.641 --> 25:19.508
I don't appreciate
being kept in the dark,
especially not today.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.139
Oh, God,
I can't believe
I've been so stupid.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.640
My father took
a bullet to keep me

25:23.731 --> 25:25.062
from that man,
and now he's with Nathan.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.685
It can't be
what you think.

25:26.776 --> 25:27.856
Why do you keep
running back to him?

25:27.944 --> 25:28.979
'Cause he's my brother.

25:29.070 --> 25:32.688
The truth is,
you have no idea
what's gonna happen.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.192
You're nervous.

Yeah, lam.

l have to find
a nuclear man,

and I don't know
if I can contain
all that power.

25:46.796 --> 25:47.911
Then run the other way.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.040
I can't.
Why not?

25:49.132 --> 25:51.748
Because if we save ourselves,
who's gonna save
everyone else?

25:52.427 --> 25:55.214
Why are you asking me
to make this sacrifice?

25:55.304 --> 25:57.465

All right?

You coming?

26:13.114 --> 26:16.151
No. This is crazy.

I can make you

hard to get away,

to what Mr. Linderman says,

27:45.331 --> 27:46.992
well,
I'll show you things

Iwon't be, I promise.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.270
What's this?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.148
It'll protect you
from the boogeyman.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.782
Thank you.

31:37.188 --> 31:38.644
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

31:39.440 --> 31:40.555
Please.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.603
I'm sorry I scared you.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.309
Just come out
and talk to me.
Please.

31:49.492 --> 31:50.857
Mom?

31:51.827 --> 31:53.158
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

31:54.997 --> 31:56.737
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

32:23.442 --> 32:25.933
I saw a vision of the future,

32:27.404 --> 32:31.022
and I'm gonna
kill a lot of people.

32:31.909 --> 32:34.366
Tell me why
I would do that.

32:43.838 --> 32:45.248
Mom?

32:47.508 --> 32:48.839
Mom?

33:10.364 --> 33:11.979
I'm leaving.

33:12.074 --> 33:15.658
And when I get back,
I expect you to be gone.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.785
Don't say that, Mom.
It's me. It's Gabriel.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.409
You're not Gabriel.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.035
You're damned,

33:22.126 --> 33:24.788
and lwant you
out of my house.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.172
Let go!

33:27.256 --> 33:28.712
Get away from me!
Mom, calm down.

33:28.799 --> 33:29.914
Get away!
Calm down.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.545
I want my son.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.880
What did you do with my son?

33:33.971 --> 33:35.882
Give me back my boy.

33:35.973 --> 33:40.091
Mom, please, it's me.
It's me, Mom, please...

33:42.646 --> 33:43.681
My Gabriel...

33:43.772 --> 33:45.273
Mom. Stop it!

33:45.357 --> 33:48.144
You're not!
You're not!
You're not!

33:48.235 --> 33:50.772
You're not! You're not!

34:20.976 --> 34:22.136
I'm sorry.

(HEART BEAT/NG)

34:34.156 --> 34:35.145
(SCREAMS)

34:35.950 --> 34:39.317
That heartbeat...
You were in the loft.
Why are you following me?

34:40.537 --> 34:41.617
I must stop you.

34:41.705 --> 34:42.785
Then do it.

34:43.832 --> 34:46.448
Do it! Kill me!

34:49.630 --> 34:52.588
You can't, you coward.

34:52.675 --> 34:54.791
Now I'm gonna
have to kill you.

34:54.885 --> 34:55.874
ANDO: Hiro!

35:17.700 --> 35:20.863
You did it.
You found the cure.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.534
Where was it?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.157
It was in me.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.243
Sometimes,

35:27.334 --> 35:30.918
when a mommy and
daddy have a sick child,

35:31.005 --> 35:33.166
they have another baby,

35:33.257 --> 35:36.875
a healthy baby with
healthy antibodies.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.177
And if we're very lucky,

35:40.264 --> 35:45.475
the healthy baby's blood
will heal the sick baby.

35:45.561 --> 35:51.898
Unfortunately,
I was born a little
too late to help my sister.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.225
But I'm not too
late to help you.

(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

36:02.619 --> 36:04.234
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

36:35.277 --> 36:38.019
You weren't even
going to say goodbye?

36:38.113 --> 36:39.694
Goodbye.

36:39.782 --> 36:42.273
I think I figured a way
for you to save the world.

36:45.079 --> 36:46.944
A gun?

36:47.039 --> 36:48.620
That's how I save the world,
that's your plan?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.538
I can handle Ted.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.958
But if I lose it,
you're the only one

36:53.045 --> 36:55.206
who can get close
enough to stop me.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.546
Right through
the back of the head.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.211
You know the spot.

37:00.302 --> 37:02.463
The same place you pulled
the piece of glass from.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.260
My destiny is
not to shoot you.

37:04.348 --> 37:05.588
The universe
cannot be that lame.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.513
You cannot run away
from who you are, Claire.

37:07.601 --> 37:08.886
This bomb is happening.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.763
How can you be so sure?

37:11.313 --> 37:13.304
Because I can
draw the future.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.765
I met a guy who can do it,
now I can do it, you see?

37:18.320 --> 37:20.151
Someone's gonna blow.

37:20.239 --> 37:23.276
Me, Ted.
It doesn't really matter.

37:23.367 --> 37:26.279
It's happening
around the election,
unless you stop it.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.156
That's Ted.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.703
You drew Ted.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.205
Are you sure?

37:32.292 --> 37:34.157
I can never forget that face.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.586
That's Kirby Plaza, midtown.

37:37.673 --> 37:39.413
Ted is here in New York.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.794
Don't you see, Claire?
You're part of this.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.589
But you have to do this.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.680
(DOOR OPENING)

37:52.771 --> 37:54.636
Thank you, Benedict.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.306
What are you doing here?

37:57.401 --> 37:59.187
I didn't think I'd see
you till later tonight.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.064
A mother can't be
worried about her son

38:01.155 --> 38:03.271
on the most important
day of his life?

38:03.365 --> 38:04.901
l was just
working on the speech,

38:04.992 --> 38:06.448
some details
of the concession.

38:06.535 --> 38:08.867
I'm not talking
about the election.

38:09.663 --> 38:10.994
Linderman called me.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.946
He said you're
getting cold feet.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.868
It's natural to
feel ambivalent.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.079
Nobody expects you
to feel otherwise.

38:20.174 --> 38:24.133
So I wanted to
give you perspective.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.720
You know about
Linderman's plans?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.965
Yes. Well,
they're not
just Linderman's.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.139
A lot of people
put time and care
into making this a reality.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.636
Myself included.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.800
You?

38:33.896 --> 38:37.184
Yes, you don't know
everything about me,
Nathan.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.686
But I do know
everything about you.

38:39.776 --> 38:41.562
And I know what
you're capable of.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.154
You think
I'm a mass murderer?

38:43.238 --> 38:46.150
Important men make
impossible decisions.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.106
President Truman
dropped two atomic bombs

38:48.202 --> 38:49.988
on Japan to end World War II.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.364
Killed thousands
to save millions.

38:52.456 --> 38:55.243
That was different,
Ma, we were at war.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.995
I can't accept this.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.919
That is your one weakness,
Nathan, you have no faith.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.213
So how could you
possibly believe
this bomb

39:03.300 --> 39:04.665
could actually
heal the world

39:04.760 --> 39:07.467
if you have no faith
in the idea of destiny?

39:09.014 --> 39:10.879
Your destiny, Nathan,

39:10.974 --> 39:12.589
is to set
the course of history

39:12.684 --> 39:14.970
after this unspeakable
act has occurred.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.807
The people will look
back on what you do

39:17.898 --> 39:22.312
as the freshman congressman
from New York,

39:22.402 --> 39:24.267
and they will thank you

39:25.113 --> 39:29.698
for your strength,
for your conviction,

39:29.785 --> 39:31.195
for your faith.

In my day, we called
it being presidential.

Can you believe?

40:06.613 --> 40:08.820
Can you be
the one we need?

40:15.539 --> 40:17.325
That's my boy.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.965
You were right, Mom.

40:37.060 --> 40:41.474
I am meant to be special,
just like you wanted.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.931
I can be anything.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.022
I can even be president.

41:09.843 --> 41:12.084
There's no sign of him.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.213
What's wrong?

41:19.436 --> 41:21.392
I'm not normal.

41:23.106 --> 41:26.724
I tried to
pretend that I was,
and ljust hurt everyone.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.025
My mom, my dad.

41:31.073 --> 41:34.156
I ruined everything
because of what I am.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.743
I hated it.

Butyou”.

41:40.332 --> 41:45.247
When I met you,
I finally felt like
I was part of something.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.827
That's funny.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.413
I felt the same thing
when I met you.

42:27.087 --> 42:29.419
He's absorbing your ability.

42:31.466 --> 42:33.206
He's gotta make it stop.
