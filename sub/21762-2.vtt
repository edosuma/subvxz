[all clamoring]

00:44.503 --> 00:45.462
The harvest.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.883
It's... It's gone unblessed by the royals!

00:49.299 --> 00:50.300
[shouting] No!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.260
We're all gonna starve!

00:52.344 --> 00:53.387
[munching loudly]

00:55.263 --> 00:57.975
I'm eating dirt here! I'm eating dirt!

00:58.433 --> 01:01.102
Please, Your Majesties,
do something. Anything!

01:01.186 --> 01:02.103
Sigh.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.522
[bell jingling]

01:03.605 --> 01:04.439
Huh?

01:04.523 --> 01:05.941
Okay, okay, everybody.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.569
Princess Julienne wants to say something.

01:08.652 --> 01:13.032
All you little people, pay attention.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.910
It is true that we could not
bless the mangoes--

01:15.993 --> 01:18.078
Because the mangoes were disgusting

01:18.161 --> 01:20.080
and made our tongues
feel like cheap tourists

01:20.163 --> 01:22.499
buying stale chewing gum
from street urchins.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.251
-Well said, dear.
-Thank you.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.046
Know this. There are other and better ways

01:27.128 --> 01:30.173
to appease Gladys,
the goddess of fruits and grains.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.342
-There are?
-Of course there are.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.262
Gladys will always accept
a lemur sacrifice.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.555
A lemur what...
Sacrifice a what?

01:36.638 --> 01:39.224
Lemur sacrifice?
Nah, let's not be too hasty.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.852
Everyone knows that blood
always works with the gods.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.896
Gods and royals both, of course.

01:43.979 --> 01:48.191
But then, we are the nearest things
to gods, aren't we, dear?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.652
Barty, you naughty rapscallion.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.571
[both laughing]

01:52.947 --> 01:53.864
Stop that!

01:54.489 --> 01:55.991
Well, they are royals.

01:56.075 --> 02:00.662
I mean, we are legally required
to sacrifice somebody, right?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.957
Well, it sounds reasonable to me.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.625
Ted.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.377
Oh, scrumplekins! Why me?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.921
Because Mort's not here.

02:09.004 --> 02:12.215
And, you're number two
on the official sacrifice list.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.761
Oh, Ted. Always dreaming of being Mr. Big.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.472
Putting yourself on the sacrifice list.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.558
I... Uh... [chuckles nervously]

02:21.642 --> 02:23.351
[screaming gibberish]

02:25.062 --> 02:26.396
Undesirables,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.189
capture the excitable lemur

02:28.273 --> 02:32.027
and Gladys, the goddess
of fruits and grains, will be very happy!

02:32.111 --> 02:33.236
[cheering]

02:33.320 --> 02:36.239
Finally, a chance to use these bolos!

02:36.323 --> 02:37.365
Whoo!

02:37.449 --> 02:40.285
[laughs nervously]
Sounds kinda drastic, Your M--

02:40.368 --> 02:43.705
Carry this, Mark.
There's a good manservant.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.165
Uh... Huh?

02:45.248 --> 02:46.750
[Julien whimpering]

02:48.752 --> 02:50.211
I hope you don't mind,

02:50.295 --> 02:53.340
but it's time to walk the plank
to a watery grave. [chuckles]

02:53.423 --> 02:54.466
Good luck there, young sir.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.843
I... Uh...

02:55.926 --> 03:00.097
[shouting] Sage! Help!

03:00.179 --> 03:01.348
That sound...

03:01.431 --> 03:03.433
[shouts] Help!

03:03.517 --> 03:05.310
Like the vocalization of a cat

03:05.393 --> 03:08.313
giving birth to the placenta
of endless possibilities.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.481
Sage!

03:10.398 --> 03:13.401
That's our super secret
distress signal thing we do.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.112
Help! Remember?

03:15.194 --> 03:18.907
Memory is but an echo of the wind
weeping for its lost spoon.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.702
Yes, I know.
But call your giant bird thingy!

03:21.785 --> 03:22.828
What giant bird thingy?

03:22.911 --> 03:26.247
-The one that feeds you bird vomit?
-Oh, right.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.668
[squawking]

03:29.751 --> 03:32.754
Oh, snap! We are so outta here.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.466
Outie-five-thousand! Hey, pirates! See ya!

03:36.550 --> 03:37.718
[screeching]

03:37.801 --> 03:39.260
Hey!

03:39.344 --> 03:41.513
Uh... That could have gone better.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.557
But, it was fun. Am I right?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.684
-[laughing]
-Yeah, of course I'm...

03:45.767 --> 03:48.062
All right, buddy, over the side.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.688
[laughing nervously]

03:49.771 --> 03:50.856
[grunting]

03:53.525 --> 03:57.612
Mort, we're sinking fast. If we go down,
we'll never find King Julien.

03:57.696 --> 04:02.159
-No! We must not fail him.
-Here, take these bloomers.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.828
Clover, I'm flattered,

04:04.912 --> 04:07.414
but I don't think this is the time.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.875
Ugh! No, the sail!

04:09.958 --> 04:11.543
Hm?

04:11.626 --> 04:16.715
You're the only one that can fit.
Get down there and plug that leak.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.426
[Mort] I shall stuff that hole
for King Julien!

04:26.016 --> 04:27.226
[sighs]

04:27.308 --> 04:30.854
I cannot believe
I am going to orphan my kingdom.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.564
They'll be so sad.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.817
They'll be all, like,
"Where is that beautiful booty?

04:35.901 --> 04:40.530
It's gone. It was eaten by the sharks."
[sobbing]

04:40.614 --> 04:42.699
No! It is not going down like that.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.535
Hey, I don't want to
tell you pirates your job,

04:45.619 --> 04:48.122
but, uh...
you are about to chum the waters

04:48.205 --> 04:51.332
with some prime pirate recruit booty here.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.251
Check it.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.880
-[making grunting noises]
-[dance music playing]

05:01.426 --> 05:04.138
I've shaken more booty,
stirred more booty,

05:04.221 --> 05:07.266
dropped more booty to the floor
than anybody.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.727
I mean, I put the "oo"
in booty up in here.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.147
-Can I get a "what-what"?
-What-what!

05:13.230 --> 05:14.982
Lil Arms Magee knows
what I'm talking about.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.985
That Mr. Julien has perfect arms.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.403
So well-proportioned to the rest of him.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.572
You know what else there, Cap'n?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.324
If you make me a pirate,

05:24.407 --> 05:27.327
I won't need no stinkin' trophies neither.

05:27.410 --> 05:31.165
I'll do all my sweet,
piratey action trophy-free.

05:31.248 --> 05:34.042
So, what do you say? Eh? Eh!

05:35.085 --> 05:36.086
[sighs]

05:36.170 --> 05:38.255
Fine. You're a pirate.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.840
Trial period only.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.926
You talk big booty,
let's see you make it happen.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.344
You will not be disappointed, Cap'n.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.598
We are gonna be so stuffed with booty.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.350
I mean stuffed! With booty!

05:51.434 --> 05:55.314
Let the raiding and pillaging begin!

05:55.396 --> 05:56.731
Arrr!

05:56.815 --> 05:58.483
[grunting]

05:59.484 --> 06:01.360
Come on, Mort. Come on.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.531
Whee!

06:05.657 --> 06:07.450
[Mort] Toilet water!

06:08.118 --> 06:08.952
Hmm?

06:12.331 --> 06:15.667
It worked! Ha!
The little fella plugged the leak!

06:16.501 --> 06:19.129
Let's bring you home, soldier. [grunts]

06:20.463 --> 06:23.591
Look what I found. Urinal cake!

06:26.385 --> 06:28.889
-Mm. Delicious!
-Start paddling, Mort.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.724
Those bloomers aren't gonna hold for long.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.894
Everybody, follow my lead!

06:34.936 --> 06:36.355
-[Julien] Pirates!
-Pirates!

06:36.437 --> 06:37.564
Arrgh!

06:37.939 --> 06:39.274
-Scurvy!
-Scallywags!

06:39.941 --> 06:42.027
Looting! Raiding!

06:42.736 --> 06:43.778
Pillaging!

06:45.113 --> 06:46.656
-[growling]
-[all scream]

06:46.740 --> 06:50.285
-[Julien] Scallywags! Peg-leg! Eyepatch!
-[laughing]

06:50.369 --> 06:51.661
Up high!

06:52.371 --> 06:57.792
All right, well, that raiding
and pillaging was, um... unique.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.213
Ho-ho! I just loved it, Mr. Julien!

07:01.671 --> 07:03.464
Thank you, thank you.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.884
Let's see what booty you've got.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.011
[all] Uh... Hmm...

07:08.095 --> 07:09.428
Nothing?

07:09.512 --> 07:10.722
No plunder?

07:10.805 --> 07:13.725
-Not one piece of booty.
-[groans]

07:13.808 --> 07:16.061
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.397
We got plenty of booty right here.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.899
-Wha-- Check it!
-[dance music playing]

07:22.734 --> 07:24.194
You can't spend that!

07:24.778 --> 07:28.282
That's not what I've heard.
Can I get an "Ay-yo!"?

07:28.365 --> 07:29.950
[all] Ay-yo!

07:30.033 --> 07:31.659
People, look at me.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.621
We did not get any loot.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.790
Do we still get a trophy for looting?

07:36.873 --> 07:41.378
You can't get a trophy for looting,
if you didn't loot anything!

07:41.461 --> 07:44.965
You could give a trophy for
"Most Improved Looting."

07:45.048 --> 07:49.094
I mean, if somebody never looted before.
Like, for example, me. So...

07:49.177 --> 07:51.305
Yeah, yeah. That's a great trophy.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.555
No!

07:52.639 --> 07:55.350
You don't need a trophy
for everything you do.

07:55.434 --> 07:59.146
[mimicking a child] "Oh, my feelings
are hurt if I don't get a trophy."

07:59.229 --> 08:00.439
That's tough!

08:00.563 --> 08:03.984
Do you know how many people
I had to pillage and raid

08:04.067 --> 08:06.361
and kill to get to be captain?

08:06.445 --> 08:07.528
Do you?

08:07.612 --> 08:11.241
Sure, it was my dad's boat
and he sort of gave me an internship,

08:11.325 --> 08:16.079
but in no way does that affect me
pulling myself up by my bootstraps!

08:17.414 --> 08:21.126
Somebody got up on the wrong side
of the poop-deck this morning.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.836
-[all chuckling]
-"Poop-deck." He said poop-deck.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.464
Something you want to say
in the back there?

08:25.546 --> 08:28.967
Uh, well, I was just telling Little Arms
and One-Eye here

08:29.050 --> 08:31.845
that it can't be that hard to be captain.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.305
Oh, really.

08:33.388 --> 08:37.017
[chuckling]
Well, why don't you try it then, huh?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.101
I dare you!

08:38.935 --> 08:40.437
Well played, King Julien.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.856
Oh, thank you very much, King Julien.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.065
Oh, not at all.

08:44.149 --> 08:49.321
I do need to get home, but maybe
a little pirate captaining can't hurt.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.447
[laughs]

08:50.530 --> 08:51.739
Right, my kidneys?

08:51.823 --> 08:52.949
[cheering]

08:53.574 --> 08:54.409
[grunts]

08:54.993 --> 08:55.827
Oh!

08:55.910 --> 08:58.705
Huntsman's horn,
how did I get myself into this?

08:58.788 --> 09:01.708
I think he went this way.
Come on. He can't hide forever.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.625
Psst! Huh?

09:02.709 --> 09:03.668
Hiya, hon.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.838
Made you some sandwiches
before you get sacrificed and all.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.132
I told you not to put yourself
on that silly list.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.177
[Horst] What a minute,
who's that Dorothy is talking to?

09:12.260 --> 09:13.512
Oh, I just saw Ted.

09:13.594 --> 09:17.432
-He went off that way, don't you know?
-Come on, let's net him!

09:17.516 --> 09:19.518
But, I want to use my bolos.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.602
I think we can do both, right?

09:22.437 --> 09:24.231
[whispers] I love you!

09:26.816 --> 09:30.404
[softly] This is just like the time
we hunted my brother down.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.072
We ran him off that cliff.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.533
-Oh, the look on his face.
-Priceless.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.911
-[laughing]
-You two are talking about murder.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.955
-Oh, for heaven's sakes.
-What do you think, Barty?

09:41.039 --> 09:44.209
-Spear or crossbow?
-Oh, spear, I think. More sporting.

09:44.292 --> 09:48.838
No, uh-uh. You are not getting this spear
if I have any say in it.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.469
I can't imagine why
you would have a say in it.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.888
Well... tally-ho!

09:57.556 --> 09:59.433
Loud noises! Very loud noises!

09:59.974 --> 10:01.935
Oh, my tenders!

10:04.020 --> 10:07.315
Sorry, Princess.
Had something in my throat. Loud noises.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.568
It... It went away.

10:09.650 --> 10:13.572
Don't be too hard on yourself, dear.
He's a slippery one.

10:13.654 --> 10:17.284
Plus, Mark here is clearly very needy.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.243
[bell jingling]

10:18.326 --> 10:20.954
My name is not Mark
and I'm not that needy.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.709
All done, Mort. She's seaworthy.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.712
-Hello, hello. What's all this then?
-Ooh.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.257
These footprints look familiar.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.427

Oh! Oh! Ooh...

10:45.395 --> 10:47.063
[laughing]

10:47.147 --> 10:48.898
There's something else here...

10:50.691 --> 10:52.026
It was pirates.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.905
Pirates!
Oh, I know where the pirates live.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.283
Maybe my King Julien is there.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.706

I suggest a full frontal attack.

Hit 'em hard and fast

14:36.876 --> 14:39.462
Well, I've always wanted to be remembered.

Okay! Here we go, guys! Let's go!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.061
Clover! Mort! [giggling]

15:37.144 --> 15:40.147
Am I glad to see you.
Now let's get out of here.

15:40.231 --> 15:44.402
Really? I mean, well. You know,
we did come all this way to rescue you.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.530
-Be kind of a shame not to have a fight.
-Yeah!

15:47.614 --> 15:48.865
Let's get 'em!

15:49.616 --> 15:51.200
It's Dread Pirate Mort!

15:51.284 --> 15:53.160
Dread Pirate Mort!

15:53.244 --> 15:54.370
No, no!

15:54.913 --> 15:56.706
No prisoners!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.374
[screaming]

15:58.999 --> 16:00.209
Attack!

16:06.382 --> 16:09.343
Hello? I'm the king here. Me!

16:09.427 --> 16:13.389
My crazy is supposed to be
the only crazy we honor. Remember?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.058
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. King?

16:16.142 --> 16:19.186
Well,
looks like we have a royal in our midst.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.104
What?

16:20.187 --> 16:22.941
Yeah, we could get a pretty penny for you.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.151
Yeah, but he's my pretty penny.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
So back off.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.781
Dread Pirate Mort. Wow.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.908
It's been too long, my old enemy.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.952
Far too long.

16:34.034 --> 16:38.289
When we last met,
we fought for the love of Empress Galeria

16:38.372 --> 16:40.333
off the jagged coast of...

16:41.334 --> 16:42.710
Fush.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.963
I remember it well.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.132
Mostly 'cause I have
a painting of it on my wall.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.634
[giggling]

16:51.719 --> 16:52.929
For Galeria!

17:03.189 --> 17:05.065
[both grunting]

17:07.318 --> 17:10.864
Ha! I gotta tell ya.
It's refreshing to fight a real pirate.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.658
You know, pirates these days
are always wanting a trophy

17:13.741 --> 17:15.618
or a pat on the back. [chuckles] Nice.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.454
In our day, we had to rack-up
five or six kills

17:18.538 --> 17:23.417
-before we even got out of bed. [chuckles]
-Kids. What are you gonna do?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.295
[Julien] I'll save you, Clover!

17:26.379 --> 17:28.673
[screaming] Oof!

17:29.089 --> 17:31.300
-Ha-hah!
-Ahh!

17:31.384 --> 17:34.261
-Hmm.
-You're welcome, Clover.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.139
Uh...

17:37.223 --> 17:39.893
What kind of a pirate has stumps for arms?

17:40.685 --> 17:42.144
That is just mean.

-Dread Pirate Mort, it was an honor.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.416
Raiding! Pillaging!

18:03.499 --> 18:04.751
Get away from Mort.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.044
[Captain Ethan screaming]

18:06.126 --> 18:08.128
He may be a super annoying toady,

18:08.212 --> 18:10.548
but he's my super annoying toady.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.675
Who's got the booty now, huh?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.636
Oh, King Julien. Oh, you saved me.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.014
Mort, stop slobbering on me.

Okay, you went all... [mimicking Clover]

18:25.021 --> 18:26.439

18:26.522 --> 18:27.648
Now can we go home?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.316
[Ted sobbing]

18:31.277 --> 18:33.279
Your Majesties,
can't we just bless the mangoes

18:33.362 --> 18:34.697
and not sacrifice Ted?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.991
Please? I mean, they're right here.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.826
Don't be such a bunion, Mark.

-Whoa!

18:46.042 --> 18:47.293
I was afraid of that.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.295
We made the captain mad.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.801
Attack!

18:56.594 --> 18:58.429
We need more hot air.

Gotta try something else.

-So close.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.239
We're almost there.

Oh, Ted, really,
that's too much drama, even for you.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.877
It isn't even lit.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.722
We got so many.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.100
-All right!
-Yeah, we love mangoes.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.561
Your Majesty, we don't have any mangoes
unless you bless them first.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.979
Easy-peasy, Mo-Mo.

21:13.522 --> 21:17.568
[laughing] Oh, baby, did daddy miss you.

21:18.194 --> 21:22.031
My heady bits was all like,
"Where's my sweet crownage?"

21:22.489 --> 21:23.532
Ah. Okay.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.995
I bless these mangoes
and the mango harvest. Boom!

21:28.079 --> 21:32.166
Thanks, Gladys, for all your Gladysness.
You rock, lady! Here you go.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.877
Nice plundering with ya. See ya around.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.837
You're the best, King Julien.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.297
[whimpering]

21:38.380 --> 21:40.174
Thank you for all the mangoes.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.759
No problem, Lil Arms!

21:42.093 --> 21:43.803
I think he's waving but I can't tell.

21:44.095 --> 21:46.180
The mangoes have been blessed?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.557
We're all gonna live!

21:48.641 --> 21:51.351
King Julien,
there's something you gotta know.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.312
Something you gotta prepare for.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.232
[Julien] Mom?

21:57.275 --> 21:59.568
Daddy? Is it really you?

21:59.652 --> 22:03.739
Ha-ha! You heard I went missing,
and then you came back.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.826
-[laughing]
-[organ playing]

22:14.583 --> 22:17.295
I knew you still loved me.
I always knew it.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.713
Nobody could ever shake that from me.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.841
Oh! We're gonna be a family again.

22:21.924 --> 22:22.758
Family!

22:22.842 --> 22:25.219
Oh! F-A-M-I-L-Y!

22:26.012 --> 22:28.931
-Family! [sobbing]
-Um... [groans]

22:29.265 --> 22:30.850
Bring it in closer.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.643
Give me the real thing.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.854
Nobody can ever shake that from me.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.147
