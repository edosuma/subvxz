00:37.659 --> 00:40.427
Okay, on site. We're going in.

00:42.778 --> 00:45.064
NYPD! Freeze!

00:46.365 --> 00:47.640
Clear!

00:47.641 --> 00:48.738
On the floor!

00:48.739 --> 00:51.566
On the floor now! Don't move!

00:51.567 --> 00:53.933
At the rear... clear!

00:53.934 --> 00:56.176
Don't move.

00:59.158 --> 01:00.160
Hello?

01:00.161 --> 01:01.309
In the kitchen!

01:01.310 --> 01:03.418
You ready? Where's Dad?

01:03.419 --> 01:04.870
On the phone somewhere.

01:04.872 --> 01:07.137
Dad!

01:07.138 --> 01:09.181
I don't why you
people are dragging me

01:09.182 --> 01:11.236
to this handball tourney anyway.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.056
What do you mean?
You love handball.

01:13.057 --> 01:14.676
I loved playing handball.

01:14.677 --> 01:15.862
Got to take a rain check.

01:15.863 --> 01:17.221
Ah. Why? What's the matter?

01:17.222 --> 01:18.695
Ah, the information's
still coming in.

01:18.696 --> 01:20.450
Dad, the Batmobile just showed up!

01:20.451 --> 01:22.735
Yeah, I know. Next time, Pop.

01:22.736 --> 01:24.257
Have fun, sweetheart.
Where you going?

01:24.258 --> 01:27.617
Dad, don't forget about your
grandson's birthday tonight.

01:27.618 --> 01:29.938
Never missed one yet.

01:29.939 --> 01:31.105
Something going on?

01:31.106 --> 01:32.148
Apparently.

01:32.149 --> 01:33.648
You're always late. If you can be

01:33.649 --> 01:35.424
consistently ten minutes late,

01:35.425 --> 01:37.212
why can't you
consistently be on time?

01:37.213 --> 01:38.266
Why are you getting
on my case, Grandpa?

01:38.267 --> 01:39.842
I just worked till
0400 this morning.

01:39.843 --> 01:41.710
Reagan. We got to get going

01:41.711 --> 01:44.819
if I'm gonna get a bleacher
seat out of the sun.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.008
All right, let's go.

01:46.009 --> 01:47.221
I got to go. What? You, too?

01:47.222 --> 01:49.274
I got a ten-two call.
I got to get back to work.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.393
I got ten tuna sandwiches.

01:51.394 --> 01:53.204
What are you gonna eat?

01:56.834 --> 01:58.176
You'd think we'd get used to it.

01:58.177 --> 02:00.690
Yeah. I'm retired.

02:04.236 --> 02:06.528
Counterterrorism has a
23-year-old Muslim-American

02:06.529 --> 02:08.842
in custody in his
apartment in Queens.

02:08.844 --> 02:11.369
Steven Hass, recently adopted

02:11.370 --> 02:14.130
the name Khalid Hassan.

02:15.140 --> 02:15.700
Raid was triggered

02:15.701 --> 02:17.589
by interception of an
e-mail to Al Qaeda leaders

02:17.590 --> 02:20.157
this morning at 0600.

02:20.158 --> 02:22.692
That's the transcription
from Arabic.

02:24.857 --> 02:29.180
"Today no rest for
oppressors in New York City."

02:29.181 --> 02:33.614
"In area of fireball
slaughters crusader enemies..."

02:33.615 --> 02:36.118
Instructions for a car bomb
were found on his computer.

02:36.119 --> 02:38.789
Precursor chemicals, tools,
wires but no device.

02:38.790 --> 02:40.799
No car.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.282
No vehicles registered in
either name at this time, but

02:43.283 --> 02:46.868
neighbors reported seeing him
in an older dark-colored SUV.

02:46.869 --> 02:48.479
What's the target?

02:48.480 --> 02:50.879
No specific target yet,

02:50.880 --> 02:52.393
but they did manage to retrieve

02:52.394 --> 02:54.989
a computer map to the
59th Street Bridge.

02:54.990 --> 02:57.129
Task force is already
shutting it down.

02:57.130 --> 02:58.421
Double up on checkpoints

02:58.422 --> 03:02.048
at all bridges and tunnels
into and out of Manhattan.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.698
Got it.

03:04.821 --> 03:07.041
It's not going to happen again.

03:07.042 --> 03:09.190
Not today.

03:09.191 --> 03:11.218
Not here.

03:19.022 --> 03:20.700
An old dark SUV, huh?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.806
Great. There's about 50
million of those in the city.

03:23.807 --> 03:25.714
Tell me about it.

03:25.715 --> 03:27.385
They know the target yet?

03:27.386 --> 03:29.373
Somewhere in Manhattan.

03:29.374 --> 03:30.969
You're kidding me.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.521
Oh, man.

03:32.522 --> 03:34.371
Linda's bringing the
boys to Central Park Zoo

03:34.372 --> 03:36.651
for Jack's birthday at 3:30

03:36.652 --> 03:38.861
All right. Yeah.

03:45.522 --> 03:46.863
Hello?

03:48.303 --> 03:49.106
Ah, shoot.

03:49.107 --> 03:50.071
What's the matter, Mom?

03:50.072 --> 03:51.469
Ah, my cell phone died.

03:51.470 --> 03:52.894
I forgot to plug it in last night.

03:52.895 --> 03:54.635
Can we get cotton candy?

03:54.636 --> 03:55.725
We'll see.

03:55.726 --> 03:57.750
We'll see like yes,
or we'll see like no?

03:57.751 --> 04:00.021
We'll see like we'll see.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.022
I'm gonna beat you.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.837
Oh, no, you're not.

04:02.838 --> 04:03.467
Come on!

04:03.468 --> 04:04.306
This is Linda.

04:04.307 --> 04:06.472
I can't take your call.
Leave a message.

04:06.473 --> 04:07.978
Hey, Linda, babe, it's me.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.101
Listen, when you get this message,

04:09.102 --> 04:11.968
just-just turn around and
take the boys home, okay?

04:11.969 --> 04:13.354
All right, I can't
really talk about it now,

04:13.355 --> 04:16.046
but just don't be in the
city today, all right?

04:16.047 --> 04:18.610
Call me as soon as you get this.

04:18.611 --> 04:20.815
I love you, babe.

05:15.876 --> 05:17.057
Chief Bell from Intelligence,

05:17.058 --> 05:19.122
Pat Mills from Homeland Security...

05:19.123 --> 05:21.510
they're all setting up
emergency operations here.

05:21.511 --> 05:24.392
Got the MTA, electric company,
Joint Task Force...

05:24.393 --> 05:25.565
everybody in the same place,

05:25.566 --> 05:27.346
so we're all up to
speed and coordinated.

05:27.347 --> 05:28.915
FBI is interviewing in the
field along with our people.

05:28.916 --> 05:30.561
Let's get at it.

05:32.597 --> 05:33.830
Chief Bell.

05:33.831 --> 05:35.630
Commissioner.

05:35.631 --> 05:37.310
Agent Mills, Homeland Security.

05:37.311 --> 05:38.470
Our lead, right?

05:38.471 --> 05:39.683
It is until I hear different.

05:39.684 --> 05:42.933
We've got a description of the
SUV on the air, 35,000 cops,

05:42.934 --> 05:45.092
on-duty and off, are on the hunt.

05:45.093 --> 05:46.770
But there are thousands
of these dark SUVs.

05:46.771 --> 05:47.638
It'll take us hours

05:47.639 --> 05:49.282
to check every one.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.750
We need to find who's driving.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.929
Homeland Security is all over this,
Commissioner.

05:52.930 --> 05:55.008
We'll get you data on every
breath Hassan has taken

05:55.009 --> 05:56.390
in the last 23 years.

05:56.391 --> 05:59.337
Why am I just finding out
about this guy today?

05:59.338 --> 06:02.052
American citizen,
American passport.

06:02.053 --> 06:02.815
We know now that

06:02.816 --> 06:05.579
he was in Yemen 14 months ago.

06:06.758 --> 06:10.653
For bomb training. There was
nothing to flag the visit.

06:11.506 --> 06:13.021
Has Washington been briefed?

06:13.022 --> 06:15.146
Anything we need.

06:15.147 --> 06:16.306
We can use all the help

06:16.307 --> 06:18.498
D.C will give us.

06:19.945 --> 06:21.948
Jim, how do we know

06:21.949 --> 06:23.626
the bomb's still in this SUV?

06:23.627 --> 06:24.764
Hassan's diagram.

06:24.765 --> 06:28.253
They built the bomb inside
the car for maximum effect.

06:31.051 --> 06:32.580
It's not a dirty bomb.

06:32.581 --> 06:33.838
How do you know?

06:33.839 --> 06:36.056
ESU found no traces of radiation

06:36.057 --> 06:38.924
in the residence or on the person.

06:38.925 --> 06:41.755
So what kind of effect
are we talking about?

06:41.756 --> 06:45.752
Ten bags of fertilizer,
two gallons of acetone peroxide,

06:45.753 --> 06:48.296
50 pounds of four-inch nails.

06:48.297 --> 06:53.291
If he used the full formula,
it's a two-story firebomb with

06:53.292 --> 06:55.766
one-block blast radius.

06:55.767 --> 06:57.302
Frags and shrapnel

06:57.303 --> 06:59.534
another half block.

06:59.535 --> 07:01.354
Where are they keeping this guy?

07:01.355 --> 07:04.187
Joint Task Force is
moving him to Major Case.

07:04.188 --> 07:06.484
Your son Danny had a prior
contact with the perp,

07:06.485 --> 07:08.843
which we hope will
help us get to him.

07:10.612 --> 07:11.445
And I've also heard

07:11.446 --> 07:16.036
that his interrogation skills
can be quite effective.

07:31.090 --> 07:32.719
You could practically eat
off the floor in this car,

07:32.720 --> 07:33.959
it's so clean.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.490
This alert seems a
lot more serious

07:35.491 --> 07:37.506
than that suspicious package
call we got yesterday.

07:37.507 --> 07:39.539
Since 9/11, we get
threats pretty regular.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.401
Usually turns out to be nothing.

07:41.402 --> 07:42.900
We'll know it's a
highly credible threat

07:42.901 --> 07:44.913
if we get another
alert within the hour.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.834
Know what I mean?

07:48.978 --> 07:50.786
Hot dog, 12 o'clock.

07:50.787 --> 07:51.962
We just ate lunch.

07:51.963 --> 07:54.596
Nah, suspicious hot dog.

07:54.597 --> 07:55.534
Get serious.

07:55.535 --> 07:56.816
Think I'm kidding?

07:56.817 --> 07:59.639
The sandwich-wearing class is
well-known to be problematic.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.238
They hide all kinds

08:00.239 --> 08:02.125
of contraband up there.

08:02.126 --> 08:03.070
Look at him.

08:03.071 --> 08:05.046
He's getting nervous.

08:05.047 --> 08:06.001
He doesn't look nervous.

08:06.002 --> 08:07.304
Yes, he does.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.265
Go question him.

08:09.266 --> 08:10.487
But the bomb...

08:10.488 --> 08:11.761
Another alert... I told you...

08:11.762 --> 08:14.363
and it gets serious.

08:14.364 --> 08:17.862
I'm not gonna question some poor
guy wearing a hot dog costume.

08:17.863 --> 08:20.083
See, that is key, kid.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.431
Why else would someone
take a humiliating job

08:22.432 --> 08:24.167
unless there's some upside to it?

08:24.168 --> 08:26.814
Unemployment's near ten
percent and rising.

08:26.815 --> 08:27.972
Stop him,

08:27.973 --> 08:30.404
question him, frisk him.

08:30.405 --> 08:32.450
Go ahead!

08:32.451 --> 08:34.352
Isn't this an abuse of the policy?

08:34.352 --> 08:35.962
He looks suspicious.

08:35.962 --> 08:37.376
We have an obligation
to check it out.

08:37.378 --> 08:38.722
Don't we? Huh?

08:41.264 --> 08:42.866
Come on.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.647
Hey, do your job.

08:48.365 --> 08:49.534
Come on!

08:53.095 --> 08:54.786
Go get him.

08:56.506 --> 08:57.362
What did I tell you?

08:57.363 --> 08:58.819
Go ahead!

09:02.023 --> 09:03.836
Come o get off me!

09:03.837 --> 09:05.365
He's got a whole drugstore here.

09:05.366 --> 09:06.188
Stop. Quit moving.

09:06.189 --> 09:07.308
Let me go. Settle down.

09:07.309 --> 09:08.772
Put your hands behind your back.

09:08.773 --> 09:10.313
Come on, let me go.
I didn't do anything.

09:10.314 --> 09:11.478
Stop moving. You got any weapons?

09:11.479 --> 09:13.152
No, I got no weapons. Let me go!

09:13.153 --> 09:15.530
Got anything else you're
not supposed to have? No!

09:15.531 --> 09:16.106
Come on, let me go.

09:16.107 --> 09:17.515
Quit moving around.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.066
What did I tell you, huh?

09:20.067 --> 09:22.080
Look at all this stuff.

09:22.081 --> 09:25.965
Let's go. Get up, Mr. Wiener. Huh?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.536
Look what we got here,
huh? Settle down!

09:27.537 --> 09:28.656
Let me go.
I didn't do anything!

09:28.657 --> 09:31.820
Settle down. We caught you with a cache
of illegal prescription drugs.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.518
Hydrocodone, oxycodone...
I don't know where they came from.

09:34.519 --> 09:35.945
The suit belongs
to the restaurant.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.282
Yeah, everybody's a comedian.

09:37.283 --> 09:39.075
Should we get this
thing off of him?

09:39.076 --> 09:40.831
There should be a
zipper there somewhere.

09:40.832 --> 09:42.581
Yeah, use two sets of cuffs.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.917
Isn't it bad enough I got
to wear this clown suit?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.031
Have a heart.

09:47.032 --> 09:48.393
Wait a second.

09:48.394 --> 09:51.844
Hey, we got to book this dog fast,
get back on the street.

09:51.845 --> 09:54.352
Come on. Top priority.

09:54.353 --> 09:56.009
Second alert in 30 minutes.
Come on.

09:56.010 --> 09:57.519
Get him in the car.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.524
This is Linda.
I can't take your call.

09:59.525 --> 10:00.385
Leave a message.

10:00.386 --> 10:01.986
Linda, you know, what's the
point of having a cell phone

10:01.987 --> 10:03.934
if you're not gonna
pick it up, babe?

10:03.935 --> 10:06.409
Call me back.

10:06.410 --> 10:07.889
Still no answer?

10:07.890 --> 10:09.414
No.

10:10.373 --> 10:12.409
You know, the zoo at Central
Park on the weekend...

10:12.410 --> 10:14.891
it's, like, wall-to-wall
babies and strollers.

10:15.011 --> 10:16.527
Sound like a good American target to you?

10:16.647 --> 10:18.894
Blow up a few families
on Saturday afternoon?

10:19.293 --> 10:21.422
Go find her, Reagan.
Send her home.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.788
And what? Maybe anybody else's
family get blown up?

10:25.313 --> 10:26.517
Alright, this is him.

10:26.916 --> 10:28.796
Ring any bells?

10:28.797 --> 10:29.779
Yup.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.520
Strong-arm robbery I worked
a few years back

10:31.521 --> 10:32.598
in the East Village.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.902
This guy got yoked
for his sneakers,

10:33.903 --> 10:35.601
roughed up pretty good.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.225
This kid's a terrorist threat now?

10:38.226 --> 10:40.117
Was a scared little
kid when I met him.

10:40.118 --> 10:41.709
Until he went radical.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.472
Second squad's chasing down some
of his cousins on Long Island.

10:44.473 --> 10:45.056
What else?

10:45.057 --> 10:48.170
Field agency interviewed the parents,
immigrated from Yemen 30 years ago.

10:48.171 --> 10:52.029
Westernized, estranged from their son,
they're blindsided by elders.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.449
Where's Vitale?

10:53.450 --> 10:55.250
Can't wait to get my hands on this kid.

10:55.251 --> 10:56.730
Hey, Central Park Station, yeah.

10:56.731 --> 10:58.481
Look, I need you to page someone in the Zoo.

10:58.482 --> 10:59.704
Linda Reagan.

10:59.705 --> 11:02.662
No, Linda Reagan, in the zoo.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.116
- Thank you. Hey, take a look at this.
- Take it through the back.

11:05.117 --> 11:06.932
Put him in there.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.440
Detective?

11:08.441 --> 11:09.777
How you doing, Reagan?

11:10.933 --> 11:12.720
Tough luck.

11:12.721 --> 11:15.195
Yeah, we found the Krakken.

11:16.646 --> 11:19.597
Don't cross the line, Danny.
We need to make this case stick.

11:21.464 --> 11:22.855
What line?

11:33.542 --> 11:35.063
What is this?

11:35.064 --> 11:36.727
Don't know.

11:36.728 --> 11:39.831
Got usually a check point here.

11:41.213 --> 11:44.380
Whatever it is, it must be
why dad and Danny had to leave.

11:45.519 --> 11:47.807
I'll call my office,
find out what's going on.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.937
Nah, the D.A.'s office
won't know anything yet.

11:49.938 --> 11:52.985
It's a police matter;
let them do their work.

11:56.544 --> 11:58.940
Got to say,
it's good to be back here.

11:58.941 --> 12:01.823
Where I spent a year's
worth of my Saturdays.

12:15.751 --> 12:17.313
Khalid, work with me.

12:17.314 --> 12:19.464
You haven't hurt anybody yet.

12:19.465 --> 12:20.672
His name's not Khalid.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.323
It's Steve.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.068
You tell him your name's Steve?

12:25.357 --> 12:26.685
If this bomb goes off,

12:26.686 --> 12:29.571
you're talking multiple homicides.

12:29.572 --> 12:32.417
The Feds have the death penalty.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.351
This guy?

12:33.352 --> 12:34.615
He's not afraid of
the death penalty.

12:34.616 --> 12:35.738
Are you, Steve?

12:35.739 --> 12:36.965
You're not afraid.

12:36.966 --> 12:38.497
I mean, why else would
he outsource the driving

12:38.498 --> 12:41.120
to someone else so
they can get blown up?

12:41.121 --> 12:43.156
Right, Steve?

12:44.354 --> 12:45.176
Just tell us where it's headed

12:45.177 --> 12:47.680
and you won't have
thrown your life away.

12:50.301 --> 12:53.303
It's your life that's
meaningless and corrupt.

12:54.711 --> 12:58.247
If this goes down,
there's no deal for you.

12:58.248 --> 13:01.015
This is your one and only
chance to do yourself some good.

13:01.016 --> 13:02.965
I am doing good.

13:02.966 --> 13:04.017
And I spit on your deal.

13:04.018 --> 13:04.909
I want a lawyer.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.535
Hey, your lawyer's
on his way, okay?

13:06.536 --> 13:07.518
But he's hit some delays

13:07.519 --> 13:08.589
because of all the checkpoints

13:08.590 --> 13:11.632
that we had to set up,
thanks to you.

13:12.774 --> 13:14.149
You remember me?

13:14.150 --> 13:15.880
You remember me, don't you, Steve?

13:15.881 --> 13:16.904
You do.

13:16.905 --> 13:18.819
I can tell.

13:18.820 --> 13:22.280
Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.

13:23.629 --> 13:26.475
You just don't want to
admit it though, right?

13:27.147 --> 13:28.049
Yeah.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.973
I know you don't want him to know.

13:29.974 --> 13:31.471
How scared you were.

13:31.472 --> 13:34.075
You're embarrassed
about what happened.

13:34.076 --> 13:36.227
But I remember.

13:36.228 --> 13:38.698
You remember you came
to see me two years ago?

13:38.699 --> 13:40.440
You got robbed.

13:40.441 --> 13:41.857
You came in and you cried

13:41.858 --> 13:45.382
and you cried and you
cried like a little girl.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.183
So, what, you a man now, hmm?

13:48.184 --> 13:50.095
You're all radicalized,
you're gonna get some payback.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.465
Is that it, Steve?

13:52.466 --> 13:53.843
You're corrupt. Yeah.

13:53.844 --> 13:54.774
Your wife and kids are corrupt.

13:54.775 --> 13:56.446
Hey, hey! You don't talk about

13:56.447 --> 13:57.443
my wife and kids! Reagan...

13:57.444 --> 13:58.907
You don't mention
my wife and kids!

13:58.908 --> 13:59.748
You're a coward!

13:59.749 --> 14:01.753
Reagan, enough, man.

14:01.754 --> 14:04.660
You want to blow up
my wife and kids?

14:05.964 --> 14:09.572
Hey, can I get something to drink?

14:10.471 --> 14:13.016
Yeah, I'll get you a drink.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.705
Anything on the NSA feed?

14:20.706 --> 14:22.599
Increased chatter,
but nothing seems to relate.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.231
Can you put up the
original e-mail intercept?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.681
I find the phrasing odd.

14:29.690 --> 14:30.898
"In area fireball

14:30.899 --> 14:32.758
slaughters crusader enemies""

14:32.759 --> 14:35.439
Yes. Hassan is a
non-native Arabic speaker.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.100
The Arabic word he used for
"Area" is "Mintaqa," but...

14:38.101 --> 14:40.676
He may have meant
something else. Probably.

14:40.677 --> 14:42.701
I need to know exactly
what he meant.

14:42.702 --> 14:44.490
Looks like we have something here.

14:44.491 --> 14:46.024
A live chat between servers

14:46.025 --> 14:50.344
in a cafe in Sana and a
training camp in rural Yemen.

14:50.345 --> 14:53.334
"Today New York feels
suffering as our people do."

14:53.335 --> 14:56.164
"Is it done yet?"

14:56.165 --> 14:58.141
"Before the new day."

14:59.267 --> 15:00.742
Could mean we have until dawn

15:00.743 --> 15:03.647
there tomorrow before the
bomber intends to detonate.

15:03.648 --> 15:07.280
Or just as likely,
midnight tonight Yemen time,

15:07.281 --> 15:09.798
which means we have
until 5 o'clock

15:09.799 --> 15:11.377
Less than six hours from now.

15:11.378 --> 15:15.282
Boss, mayor's office is
asking for a joint statement.

15:15.283 --> 15:18.144
Tell them I recommend no
public statement at this time.

15:18.145 --> 15:18.714
Commissioner...

15:18.715 --> 15:20.090
We don't have enough information

15:20.091 --> 15:22.463
to do anything but cause a panic.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.135
Gridlocked streets,
bridges and tunnels jammed,

15:25.136 --> 15:26.802
people trying to get out.

15:26.803 --> 15:28.017
There could be repercussions for

15:28.018 --> 15:30.261
withholding information.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.626
I know that. You also understand

15:31.627 --> 15:32.467
that I'm going to have to

15:32.468 --> 15:34.379
brief D.C. about this.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.951
I'm clear on that, too.

15:42.950 --> 15:44.608
Change of plans.

15:44.609 --> 15:46.586
We need to swing by Chelsea Piers.

15:46.587 --> 15:47.805
They want all hands on deck

15:47.806 --> 15:49.198
at these checkpoints.

15:49.199 --> 15:49.909
What about...

15:49.910 --> 15:51.898
Yeah, yeah, what about me?

15:51.899 --> 15:54.466
The wiener's going
for a ride. Come on.

16:06.119 --> 16:07.955
Okay, go. Go.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.567
Can we work something out here?

16:11.568 --> 16:14.160
You got a record of dealing, pal.

16:14.161 --> 16:16.089
You're in hot water.

16:16.923 --> 16:18.449
Get out the car, please.

16:21.843 --> 16:22.780
You get it?

16:22.781 --> 16:23.894
Hot water?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.724
Steaming the sausage?

16:25.725 --> 16:28.065
Huh? I get it.

16:28.066 --> 16:29.389
Very, very funny.

16:29.390 --> 16:32.594
I think it's very funny,
personally.

16:33.849 --> 16:35.542
Hey, that van is
running the checkpoint.

16:35.543 --> 16:37.477
Come on, chop-chop.

16:37.478 --> 16:39.575
Whoa, whoa.

16:39.576 --> 16:41.650
Stop! Stop!

16:45.489 --> 16:48.137
Stay back! Show me your hands!

16:48.138 --> 16:48.805
Stay back! Stay back!

16:48.806 --> 16:50.839
Show me your hands!

16:50.840 --> 16:52.220
12th Sergeant to Central.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.569
Be advised we have a
dark SUV at the corner of

16:54.570 --> 16:56.679
West 23rd and West Side Highway.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.066
Requesting ESU and
Bomb Squad forthwith.

17:00.067 --> 17:03.003
Don't move! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

17:04.384 --> 17:06.920
Keep your hands where
I can see them!

17:06.921 --> 17:08.212
Okay, okay, don't shoot,
don't shoot.

17:08.213 --> 17:10.871
I'm so sorry.
Is there a bomb in the car?

17:10.872 --> 17:11.718
What?

17:11.719 --> 17:13.936
A bomb in the car.

17:13.938 --> 17:15.598
Oh, my God, there's
a bomb in the car?!

17:15.598 --> 17:17.039
I don't know, is there?!

17:17.040 --> 17:20.059
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
there's a bomb in the car?!

17:20.060 --> 17:23.243
God, there's a bomb in the car!

17:23.244 --> 17:25.489
Are you stoned?

17:25.490 --> 17:26.772
Okay, well, maybe a little bit.

17:26.773 --> 17:28.266
Just a little, just a little high.

17:28.267 --> 17:29.057
Unlock the car.

17:29.058 --> 17:30.923
Get out of the car,
you dopey knucklehead.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.191
Come on. Let's go.

17:34.061 --> 17:36.613
What are you smoking, huh?

17:36.614 --> 17:39.437
- Must be good.
- Central, 12 Sergeant Op.

17:39.438 --> 17:42.340
Our SUV driver doesn't
appear to be the suspect.

17:42.341 --> 17:44.246
No further at this location.

17:45.730 --> 17:47.506
He's not talking.

17:47.507 --> 17:49.099
You know, let's get
anything we can get

17:49.100 --> 17:50.564
on who's driving that bomb
and where they're headed.

17:50.565 --> 17:52.007
Over 700 stops so far.

17:52.008 --> 17:52.923
It's gonna take us two days

17:52.924 --> 17:54.411
to go through everybody.
Hey, you know what?

17:54.412 --> 17:55.686
So let's focus on the Arabs,

17:55.687 --> 17:58.236
see if anyone's connected
to Steven Hass from Queens.

17:58.237 --> 18:00.448
Profiling.

18:00.449 --> 18:02.501
Call it what you want.

18:02.502 --> 18:04.306
Got to do it.

18:04.307 --> 18:06.722
How many times you been stopped?

18:06.723 --> 18:08.945
Not as many as my father.

18:10.251 --> 18:11.686
Let's cross-check with airlines,

18:11.687 --> 18:12.764
see if anyone went to Yemen

18:12.765 --> 18:14.247
around the same time as Hass.

18:14.248 --> 18:16.132
And see if anyone's a
member of his mosque.

18:16.133 --> 18:17.088
Vitale's still at it?

18:17.089 --> 18:19.461
Yeah, he's got me on time-out.

18:20.547 --> 18:23.020
Tell you what, hatred's
done wonders for this kid.

18:23.021 --> 18:25.210
He's manned up now.

18:25.211 --> 18:27.236
If that's what you
want to call it.

18:37.146 --> 18:38.624
With this friggin' message.

18:38.625 --> 18:39.464
It's Linda.
I can't take your call.

18:39.465 --> 18:40.984
Leave a message. Still no answer?

18:40.985 --> 18:42.352
No.

18:42.353 --> 18:44.351
Damn it.

18:46.146 --> 18:46.888
Linda?

18:46.889 --> 18:48.949
No, it's me. Listen.

18:48.950 --> 18:50.439
Grandpa didn't want
me to bother you,

18:50.440 --> 18:51.872
but what is going on?

18:51.873 --> 18:54.312
I'm looking at a pretty
aggressive checkpoint here.

18:54.313 --> 18:56.197
Are you working on a terrorist
threat or something?

18:56.198 --> 18:58.538
Yeah, credible threat,
car bomb in Manhattan.

18:58.539 --> 18:59.426
You guys still in Brooklyn?

18:59.427 --> 19:00.725
Yeah. Wait.

19:00.726 --> 19:03.029
Didn't Linda say she was going
to the zoo today with the kids?

19:03.030 --> 19:04.980
Yeah, and her phone keeps
going straight to voice mail.

19:04.981 --> 19:05.882
Damn battery's so old

19:05.883 --> 19:07.062
it won't hold a charge.

19:07.063 --> 19:07.764
All right, Danny,

19:07.765 --> 19:09.074
I'll go and find them, okay?

19:09.075 --> 19:09.924
No, you're not going anywhere.

19:09.925 --> 19:11.097
Just stay in Brooklyn, okay?

19:11.098 --> 19:12.215
Please.

19:12.216 --> 19:13.457
You don't sound good.

19:13.458 --> 19:14.522
I'm frustrated.

19:14.523 --> 19:17.405
Pulled over every Arab in the
freakin' state in an SUV;

19:17.406 --> 19:18.553
nothing's shaking out.

19:18.554 --> 19:20.000
Why are you so sure he's Arab?

19:20.001 --> 19:21.610
'Cause we have one
in custody already.

19:21.611 --> 19:22.797
From where?

19:22.798 --> 19:24.460
Yemen by way of Queens.

19:24.461 --> 19:25.257
Okay.

19:25.258 --> 19:27.697
You know that terrorist
profiles are changing.

19:27.698 --> 19:29.535
I got several cases in
the office right now...

19:29.536 --> 19:31.938
You gonna start this
again with the ACLU crap?

19:31.939 --> 19:32.917
Okay, Danny,

19:32.918 --> 19:34.768
Danny, remember that white kid

19:34.769 --> 19:35.871
from California? Yeah.

19:35.872 --> 19:37.555
Or Timothy McVeigh.

19:37.556 --> 19:39.683
All right, there's an
English language music video

19:39.684 --> 19:43.513
on the Internet right now
recruiting American terrorists.

19:43.514 --> 19:45.479
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.138
Okay? I got to go.

19:55.639 --> 19:57.412
All right, you know what?

19:57.413 --> 19:59.656
Start pulling all the stop and
frisks we passed over earlier

19:59.657 --> 20:02.711
'cause people were too white,
too cuddly or whatever.

20:03.551 --> 20:05.739
That you don't hear very often.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.046
It's one of those days.

20:10.090 --> 20:12.960
Wake up, O'Hanlon!
Juice that sucker!

20:12.961 --> 20:14.313
Come on, kill shot!

20:14.314 --> 20:16.476
Let's end this game!

20:17.345 --> 20:19.744
O'Hanlon, you stink!

20:19.745 --> 20:22.053
You stink!

20:22.054 --> 20:25.165
Ah! I'm glad we came.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.944
Me, too.

20:26.945 --> 20:30.295
I, um, I like showing
you off to the guys.

20:31.265 --> 20:33.459
I also like watching a good match.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.047
Not as much as I liked
playing it, but...

20:36.048 --> 20:37.403
You'll get back out there.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.100
My athletic days are over,
I think.

20:40.101 --> 20:44.199
Well, then who's going to teach
Nicky how to play handball?

20:44.200 --> 20:46.563
Nicky does not care
about handball.

20:46.564 --> 20:48.952
Neither did Danny.

20:48.953 --> 20:50.339
He didn't?

20:50.340 --> 20:51.328
No.

20:51.329 --> 20:53.461
He just liked the time
he spent with you.

20:53.462 --> 20:56.509
He'd always come home
retelling your stories.

20:56.510 --> 20:58.518
I saw you on the phone.

20:58.519 --> 21:00.862
So, uh, what'd you find out?

21:00.863 --> 21:02.184
What's going on?

21:04.137 --> 21:05.660
Car bomb threat in town.

21:05.661 --> 21:06.707
Linda and the boys are there.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.975
Danny can't get ahold of them.

21:08.976 --> 21:12.463
When is this crap gonna stop?

21:12.464 --> 21:14.287
In my day, it was simple.

21:14.288 --> 21:18.614
H-bomb, mutual assured
destruction, a standoff.

21:18.615 --> 21:22.022
These guys...
they can't wait to go.

21:32.156 --> 21:33.896
Tell me what your e-mail said.

21:33.897 --> 21:35.121
Oh, man, you know what it says.

21:35.122 --> 21:37.502
You got a translation right there.

21:37.503 --> 21:40.116
Yeah, but it doesn't
make any sense.

21:40.117 --> 21:44.423
"No rest for the oppressors
today in New York City."

21:44.424 --> 21:46.330
That's right.

21:46.331 --> 21:47.937
"No rest for the oppressors

21:47.938 --> 21:51.634
today in New York City." And?

21:51.635 --> 21:53.754
I asked you for a drink of water.

21:53.755 --> 21:55.680
You're not gonna die
of thirst, Steve.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.869
Other things, maybe.

21:56.870 --> 21:57.710
Not that.

21:57.711 --> 22:00.602
"No rest for the oppressors
today in New York City."

22:00.603 --> 22:02.652
We've been over this
a thousand times.

22:02.653 --> 22:05.866
Yeah, but there's more
words here than that.

22:10.484 --> 22:12.862
You don't know Arabic, do you?

22:14.551 --> 22:16.178
Yes, I do.

22:16.179 --> 22:17.495
Yeah?

22:20.880 --> 22:22.448
So, this one.

22:23.922 --> 22:27.001
Come on. You speak Arabic.

22:27.002 --> 22:28.905
What kind of terrorist would you
be if you didn't speak Arabic?

22:28.906 --> 22:30.567
Spit it out.

22:30.568 --> 22:32.177
Come on, Steve.

22:38.424 --> 22:39.954
Come on.

22:39.955 --> 22:42.609
"Crusader enemies""

22:44.171 --> 22:45.655
This?

22:45.656 --> 22:48.077
"Slaughter""

22:48.078 --> 22:50.489
This?

22:50.490 --> 22:52.555
"Fireball."

22:54.641 --> 22:56.797
This one?

22:56.798 --> 22:57.837
"Park."

22:57.838 --> 22:59.804
"Park"? Hey.

22:59.805 --> 23:01.859
Don't play me for a fool.

23:01.860 --> 23:03.854
That word means, "Area."

23:03.855 --> 23:05.395
That word... mintaqa...

23:05.396 --> 23:08.004
means "Park."

23:09.804 --> 23:11.240
It's a park.

23:11.241 --> 23:12.482
What? No.

23:12.483 --> 23:13.492
You just said it.

23:13.493 --> 23:14.797
I never said "Park"" Yes, you did.

23:14.798 --> 23:16.057
You just said it.
You're just trying

23:16.058 --> 23:16.974
to confuse me.
I didn't say "Park""

23:16.975 --> 23:18.938
No, you meant to write "Park."

23:18.939 --> 23:20.134
I didn't say park!
But you wrote "Area."

23:20.135 --> 23:23.081
You meant "Park"!
I didn't say "Park"!

23:39.051 --> 23:40.461
I'm redeploying men to every park

23:40.462 --> 23:42.373
and playground in Manhattan.

23:42.374 --> 23:43.675
That's more than a
hundred locations.

23:43.676 --> 23:44.919
It's a good lead.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.403
Commissioner,
mayor's on the way up.

23:48.820 --> 23:50.282
Excuse me.

23:52.783 --> 23:55.431
Took him a little
longer than I expected.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.239
I guess my point is that...

24:02.240 --> 24:05.488
if this bomb explodes and we
haven't warned the public,

24:05.489 --> 24:08.904
or if the press gets
out in front of us...

24:08.905 --> 24:12.816
So wouldn't it be better
to have every man and woman

24:12.817 --> 24:15.246
in this city on the
lookout for this vehicle?

24:15.247 --> 24:19.476
It would if we had the specifics
on the SUV and the target.

24:19.477 --> 24:20.135
Right now,

24:20.136 --> 24:22.884
we'd only be creating chaos.

24:24.034 --> 24:25.229
I serve at your pleasure, sir,

24:25.230 --> 24:27.565
but we're just not there yet.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.964
I appreciate that, okay?

24:31.428 --> 24:32.571
So what happens

24:32.572 --> 24:36.418
if hundreds of New Yorkers
get blown to bits,

24:37.345 --> 24:39.260
thousands maybe,
and we didn't warn them?

24:39.261 --> 24:40.305
You understand?

24:40.306 --> 24:42.818
We didn't tell them
to leave the parks.

24:42.819 --> 24:45.480
I know the stakes, Mr. Mayor.

24:45.481 --> 24:49.505
We will find this bomb,
and we will disarm it.

24:51.994 --> 24:53.518
All right. You got till 4:00,
then I hold

24:53.519 --> 24:56.591
a press conference,
and you'll be there.

24:56.592 --> 24:59.915
Just a lot of people out on a
Saturday afternoon, you know?

24:59.916 --> 25:02.921
So this is on you.

25:11.298 --> 25:12.832
How could we possibly
have pulled over

25:12.833 --> 25:14.668
this many Muslims today?

25:14.669 --> 25:15.803
It's New York.

25:15.804 --> 25:17.341
It's still a blind spot.

25:17.342 --> 25:18.516
What have you got?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.678
I got a 22-year-old
male white from Queens

25:20.679 --> 25:22.351
stopped at 1:15 in Harlem.

25:22.352 --> 25:23.135
Not Muslim.

25:23.136 --> 25:24.097
Female in the car with him.

25:24.098 --> 25:25.374
Didn't fully toss the SUV,

25:25.375 --> 25:27.113
but guys saw nothing suspicious.

25:27.114 --> 25:27.635
Keep looking.

25:27.636 --> 25:30.057
Remind me to kill my wife,
if I ever find her.

25:31.935 --> 25:33.337
Mildred Ames.

25:33.338 --> 25:34.893
Stopped at 2:35 in Chelsea.

25:34.894 --> 25:36.009
You know what? Call me crazy,

25:36.010 --> 25:38.638
but I'm going to guess that
while it may be very exciting,

25:38.639 --> 25:41.948
75 is probably a little bit too
old to be a suicide bomber.

25:41.949 --> 25:43.312
We don't know it's
a suicide bomber.

25:43.313 --> 25:45.340
Could be a remote detonation.

25:45.341 --> 25:46.971
Yeah. Whatever.

25:47.896 --> 25:49.698
Mary Jo Clarkson, Long Island.

25:49.699 --> 25:51.941
Married...

25:51.942 --> 25:55.143
Married to Alex Hass.

25:55.144 --> 25:56.639
Alex Hass?

25:56.640 --> 25:58.075
That's one of Khalid's
cousins, right?

25:58.076 --> 26:00.296
Think it's a coincidence?
Never is.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.930
She's got no priors. Let's see

26:01.931 --> 26:04.291
if Mary Jo Clarkson has
a social networking page

26:04.292 --> 26:06.321
that tells us all about her.

26:06.322 --> 26:08.242
Alex Hass was
questioned in his office

26:08.243 --> 26:10.165
at the university at 14:00 hours.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.956
Teaches economics there.
Westernized guy.

26:11.957 --> 26:13.182
No known contacts with
any extremist groups.

26:13.183 --> 26:13.797
That doesn't matter, though.

26:13.798 --> 26:16.104
His wife was pulled over
in an SUV in Manhattan.

26:16.105 --> 26:17.674
The SUV fit the
description given to us

26:17.675 --> 26:19.523
by his bomb-making cousin.
See if you can find

26:19.524 --> 26:20.900
a surveillance video of her stop.

26:20.901 --> 26:22.025
Yep.

26:22.966 --> 26:24.993
All right, Mary Jo Clarkson,

26:24.994 --> 26:27.229
married name Hass.
Husband's name: Alex,

26:27.230 --> 26:29.761
one son, Jacob, age nine.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.758
She's a member of the same
radical mosque as Khalid.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.029
She's an Islamic convert? Yeah.

26:34.030 --> 26:35.527
Usually, they're the most zealous.

26:35.528 --> 26:38.015
Where was she when we stopped her?

26:39.019 --> 26:41.181
She's got a link to a
suicide bomber video

26:41.182 --> 26:42.315
right here on her page.

26:42.316 --> 26:43.186
Are you kidding me?

26:43.187 --> 26:44.956
How is she not flagged
by Homeland Security?

26:44.957 --> 26:45.990
I have no idea.

26:45.991 --> 26:48.522
You know millions of people
watch this crap every day.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.884
Danny.

26:50.885 --> 26:53.443
This is the shot
from the checkpoint.

26:53.444 --> 26:55.502
She's got a kid with her.

26:55.503 --> 26:56.850
You know what?

26:56.851 --> 26:58.577
Let's go scoop her husband.

26:58.578 --> 27:00.199
Come on.

27:08.076 --> 27:11.118
A photograph of Mary Jo Clarkson
is going out right now,

27:11.119 --> 27:14.197
and Major Case is picking up
her husband at the University.

27:14.198 --> 27:16.183
We're stepping downtown parks,

27:16.184 --> 27:18.479
especially Washington Square.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.161
We don't stop looking
at everyone else.

27:20.162 --> 27:21.954
This is a lead, not a sure thing.

27:21.955 --> 27:26.132
Understood. You know,
finding her is only half the problem.

27:26.133 --> 27:27.363
I know that.

27:27.364 --> 27:29.594
J.T., call the mayor's office.

27:29.595 --> 27:32.276
I think it's time we go public.

28:02.927 --> 28:04.250
Alex Hass?

28:04.251 --> 28:05.589
Yes? May I help you?

28:05.590 --> 28:06.664
Yeah, step inside.
What's going on?

28:06.665 --> 28:07.816
You know where your wife is?

28:07.817 --> 28:09.596
She's not my wife anymore.
We're divorced.

28:09.597 --> 28:10.886
Is something wrong? Back, back!

28:10.887 --> 28:12.053
Yeah. Where is she?

28:12.054 --> 28:13.517
She's on her way to meet me.

28:13.518 --> 28:14.813
Is she all right? Meet you where?

28:14.814 --> 28:15.930
Because my son's with her.
All right. Meet you where?

28:15.931 --> 28:17.544
Tell me what's going on.
Where is she gonna meet you?

28:17.545 --> 28:19.101
Here? No. At the park.

28:19.102 --> 28:20.359
What park? Washington Square?

28:20.360 --> 28:22.526
Yeah. You're scaring me.

28:22.527 --> 28:23.978
Well, you're scaring me,
too, buddy.

28:23.979 --> 28:25.683
What's all this stuff
on the blackboard there?

28:25.684 --> 28:26.833
Huh? What's all that?

28:26.834 --> 28:28.133
Economics. Economics?

28:28.134 --> 28:29.487
My thesis. Hey. Yeah.

28:29.488 --> 28:31.606
She's gonna meet him in
Washington Square Park.

28:31.607 --> 28:32.950
Yeah.

28:32.951 --> 28:34.779
Exactly when and where?

28:34.780 --> 28:36.380
4:00, near the Arch.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.317
4:00, near the Arch. You got it?

28:38.318 --> 28:40.000
Yeah. No, now. Bring the cavalry.

28:40.001 --> 28:40.803
Let's go.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.709
No. She has my son.

28:42.710 --> 28:44.100
Tell me what's going on.

28:44.101 --> 28:45.730
Why don't you tell
me what's going on?

28:45.731 --> 28:47.508
Why you meeting your wife?

28:47.509 --> 28:48.207
I was... Come on!

28:48.208 --> 28:49.997
I was awarded full custody
of my son last Tuesday.

28:49.998 --> 28:51.049
She's bringing him to me.

28:51.050 --> 28:53.082
She just asked for one
last night all together,

28:53.083 --> 28:56.102
said she had a beautiful
place to show us.

28:56.103 --> 28:58.280
Beautiful place?

28:58.281 --> 28:59.309
Yeah.

28:59.310 --> 29:00.974
Okay, Alex. I need you to
come with me right now.

29:00.975 --> 29:03.280
Okay? I'll explain
it outside. Let's go.

29:03.281 --> 29:04.894
Come on.

29:05.766 --> 29:07.007
Your wife, is she radical?

29:07.008 --> 29:09.258
She converted to
Islam two years ago

29:09.259 --> 29:10.876
and went completely nuts.

29:10.877 --> 29:13.543
She and my cousin follow this
radical imam in the Bronx.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.958
I've been trying to get Jacob
away from her ever since.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.668
Is she crazy enough
to make a bomb?

29:17.669 --> 29:19.942
Oh, my God. No. Jacob is with her.

29:19.943 --> 29:21.011
I got to get him away from her.

29:21.012 --> 29:23.026
No, no, no. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

29:23.027 --> 29:25.192
You could be the trigger,
okay? So slow down.

29:25.193 --> 29:26.012
What do you mean?

29:26.013 --> 29:28.184
The stuff she's saying to you.
One last night together.

29:28.185 --> 29:31.822
The beautiful place. Slow down.

29:31.823 --> 29:32.577
Come on.

29:32.578 --> 29:34.200
Take it easy.

29:43.143 --> 29:44.925
What kind of world?

29:45.653 --> 29:47.367
We're looking for a blonde
housewife driving around

29:47.368 --> 29:49.745
with a bomb and a kid in the car.

29:50.651 --> 29:52.775
The cop who let her through
has got to be kicking himself.

29:52.776 --> 29:55.245
I wouldn't want that
hanging over me.

29:55.246 --> 29:57.842
Though I can't say I
wouldn't have done the same.

29:57.843 --> 30:00.228
Probably saw the soccer
balls back there,

30:00.229 --> 30:03.258
whatever she had the
devices covered up with.

30:03.259 --> 30:05.267
They must know where she is now,

30:05.268 --> 30:06.516
or at least her intended target.

30:06.517 --> 30:08.448
Otherwise, they wouldn't be
sending us down here, right?

30:08.449 --> 30:11.248
All we know is we got a 10-85
to help set up a perimeter.

30:11.249 --> 30:14.101
But a perimeter, must be to keep
people away from an explosion.

30:14.102 --> 30:16.056
We don't know that.
All we know is we were told

30:16.057 --> 30:18.610
to report to the
supervisor at the scene.

30:18.611 --> 30:20.952
I'd like to know what we're
getting into. Wouldn't you?

30:20.953 --> 30:23.555
When you pass the captain's test,
Reagan, you'll know.

30:23.556 --> 30:26.993
For now, get used to not
knowing and following orders.

30:26.994 --> 30:30.418
Street cops get the
worm's eye view.

30:30.419 --> 30:32.267
You know what I mean, kid?

30:32.268 --> 30:34.183
Yeah.

30:34.184 --> 30:35.600
Yeah.

30:43.014 --> 30:45.786
Am I sleeping at
Daddy's house tonight?

30:45.787 --> 30:47.628
We'll all be together tonight.

30:47.629 --> 30:48.803
Where?

30:48.804 --> 30:49.957
A beautiful place.

30:49.958 --> 30:51.949
Where?

30:51.950 --> 30:54.560
It's a surprise.

31:13.673 --> 31:15.202
Is that her SUV?

31:15.203 --> 31:15.924
Oh, my God.

31:15.925 --> 31:16.756
There they are. Hey, hey, hey!

31:16.757 --> 31:18.832
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

31:18.833 --> 31:20.605
You over there is what she wants.

31:20.606 --> 31:21.487
Okay? If she sees you,

31:21.488 --> 31:23.447
she's probably going
to set off the bomb.

31:23.448 --> 31:24.837
Okay, okay. You stay put.

31:24.838 --> 31:26.600
Okay.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.800
You stay out of sight.

31:28.801 --> 31:30.555
Don't move.

31:43.650 --> 31:46.835
Yeah. This is Detective Reagan,
Shield number 8714.

31:46.836 --> 31:49.194
I have a visual on
the car bomb suspect

31:49.195 --> 31:52.744
at the corner of Washington
Square North and Fifth Avenue.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.657
Requesting 10-85 forthwith
to clear the park.

31:55.658 --> 31:56.801
Yeah, no radios.

31:56.802 --> 32:00.162
No cell phones. Any electronics
could set this thing off.

32:00.163 --> 32:01.950
Yeah.

32:10.204 --> 32:12.820
Where is he? Where's Daddy?

32:27.515 --> 32:29.413
It's a 4:00 press conference,

32:29.414 --> 32:31.350
so media's waiting downstairs.

32:31.351 --> 32:33.111
Let's talk about what
we're going to say.

32:33.112 --> 32:36.732
We give them a description
of the woman and the vehicle.

32:36.733 --> 32:39.465
Uh-huh? And tell them there's
a bomb in the back seat?

32:39.466 --> 32:41.432
We do.

32:42.937 --> 32:46.497
Just saying it out loud, it's...

32:48.208 --> 32:49.826
This is the right thing to do.

32:49.827 --> 32:50.732
I think it is.

32:50.733 --> 32:52.643
We've located the suspect.

32:52.644 --> 32:55.408
Well, that changes everything.

33:04.051 --> 33:05.936
I need you to go back
to the office, okay?

33:05.937 --> 33:08.116
My boy... No, no,
don't you understand?

33:08.117 --> 33:10.264
Listen, she wants to
blow you up, okay?

33:10.265 --> 33:11.684
If I let you go over there,
they're gonna be

33:11.685 --> 33:13.680
pulling our body
parts from the trees.

33:13.681 --> 33:16.043
She... wants us to stay together.

33:16.044 --> 33:19.375
She wants you to stay
together in Heaven, okay?

33:19.376 --> 33:21.127
She sees you, it's over.

33:21.128 --> 33:22.132
Go back to your office.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.963
Would you leave your son?

33:23.964 --> 33:26.915
I'm... I'm trying
to save your son.

33:26.916 --> 33:29.406
Okay? Your son.
The bomb squad is on the way.

33:29.407 --> 33:31.001
They're gonna get your son
out of there. No, no, no.

33:31.002 --> 33:33.014
If she sees the police,
she'll set it off.

33:33.015 --> 33:33.984
She'll never let him go.

33:33.985 --> 33:35.751
I've tired to reason
with her for two years.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.447
We have to go get him.
I can't help you. I can't help you.

33:37.448 --> 33:38.565
We're waiting for the bomb squad.

33:38.566 --> 33:40.575
No, no, no, please,
he's innocent. I...

33:40.576 --> 33:41.524
He's nine years old.

33:41.525 --> 33:42.701
Please, look at me.

33:42.702 --> 33:44.983
He's my son.
I can't go over there.

33:44.984 --> 33:47.309
He's my son.

33:53.439 --> 33:56.366
Don't move. Okay.

34:20.518 --> 34:22.154
Who are you?

34:22.155 --> 34:23.188
I'm Danny.

34:23.190 --> 34:24.571
Um, I work with Alex.

34:24.572 --> 34:27.129
He wanted me to come
over and-and get you guys

34:27.130 --> 34:28.304
and to let you know that he's

34:28.306 --> 34:29.496
gonna be tied up for a while.

34:29.498 --> 34:31.299
He wanted me to bring you over...

34:33.795 --> 34:36.565
We'll wait here. Uh,
tell him... tell him to come down.

34:36.567 --> 34:39.502
Uh, uh, I know you probably
want to wait, but he's really...

34:39.503 --> 34:42.201
He's tied up with a student,
and they're working really late,

34:42.202 --> 34:43.428
and it's gonna be a while,
so he really wants you

34:43.429 --> 34:44.641
to come on with me. Why don't we

34:44.641 --> 34:48.101
walk over together,
and you can be with Alex over there.

34:48.103 --> 34:51.079
I don't want to leave my car here.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.904
Okay, okay, well, I'll tell you what,
I'll wait with you.

34:53.905 --> 34:55.915
Okay? We'll stay here,
we'll wait for Alex,

34:55.916 --> 34:57.629
and...

34:58.786 --> 35:02.109
We'll just wait, okay?

35:02.110 --> 35:02.946
Uh, I can't believe,

35:02.947 --> 35:05.515
um, I haven't met you guys before.

35:06.595 --> 35:10.140
I do economics with Alex.

35:10.141 --> 35:11.310
He speaks a lot about you.

35:11.311 --> 35:12.445
What's your name, little man?

35:12.446 --> 35:15.101
Jacob. Jacob! Nice to meet you!

35:15.102 --> 35:17.421
What are they doing over there?

35:18.764 --> 35:21.462
Who are you?

35:21.463 --> 35:23.946
I don't know who those
people are, okay?

35:23.947 --> 35:25.117
I'll tell you what.

35:25.118 --> 35:26.562
I'll go get Alex,
I'll bring him down,

35:26.563 --> 35:29.141
and you guys talk amongst
yourselves, okay?

35:29.142 --> 35:31.455
I' bring him to you,
all right? Hey?

35:31.456 --> 35:33.315
Relax.

35:35.524 --> 35:36.603
Daddy!

35:36.604 --> 35:37.301
Jacob!

35:37.302 --> 35:39.167
It's okay, baby! You're okay!

35:39.168 --> 35:40.694
Alex! No! Do not come over here!

35:40.695 --> 35:41.877
Step aside! Come over here!

35:41.878 --> 35:44.805
Hey! You stay back!

35:44.806 --> 35:46.015
Get back!

35:46.016 --> 35:48.851
What does your son
think he's doing?

35:54.697 --> 35:56.775
Shut up! Shut up!

35:56.776 --> 35:59.457
Get back behind the monument! Now!

36:01.773 --> 36:03.898
You cannot separate us! It's okay.

36:03.899 --> 36:05.251
Get him out of there! Now!

36:05.252 --> 36:08.122
Alex! Come back!
I will blow this up!

36:08.123 --> 36:11.195
No! No! I will kill your son!

36:12.345 --> 36:13.335
Don't! Mary Jo!

36:13.336 --> 36:14.889
No!

36:14.890 --> 36:16.388
Mary Jo,

36:16.389 --> 36:19.086
look at me, look at me.
Look at me!

36:19.087 --> 36:20.368
You don't want to do that.

36:20.369 --> 36:21.930
Okay? You don't want to do that.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.134
It's okay, all right?

36:23.135 --> 36:24.801
You do not want to do this.

36:24.802 --> 36:26.723
Okay? You don't want to die alone.

36:26.724 --> 36:28.480
Hey, hey, I understand.

36:28.481 --> 36:31.217
I understand, okay?
You don't want to die alone.

36:31.218 --> 36:33.058
You don't want to die
without Alex, okay?

36:33.059 --> 36:34.136
Don't do anything.

36:34.137 --> 36:35.848
It's okay.

36:35.849 --> 36:39.551
This is not how
it's supposed to go.

36:45.202 --> 36:47.002
If she sets it off...

36:47.003 --> 36:50.576
ESU's ready to move in
and pull him out, Frank.

36:52.101 --> 36:53.480
Sergeant...

36:53.481 --> 36:54.784
tell ESU to follow

36:54.785 --> 36:57.747
Detective Reagan's lead.

37:01.614 --> 37:05.998
First officer on the scene
always has the most information.

37:05.999 --> 37:08.973
And he's a senior detective.

37:12.792 --> 37:14.477
Stay back.

37:17.005 --> 37:18.823
Okay. Mary Jo?

37:18.824 --> 37:20.613
Mary Jo.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.138
Look...

37:22.139 --> 37:24.058
It's okay, it's okay, you win.

37:24.059 --> 37:26.051
I understand.
You want to talk to Alex.

37:26.052 --> 37:28.375
Yeah? I can help you
with that, okay?

37:28.376 --> 37:30.988
I just need you to be calm, okay?

37:30.989 --> 37:31.808
Look, I'm gonna bring him over,

37:31.809 --> 37:34.323
but I need you to do
something for me, all right?

37:34.324 --> 37:36.181
I need you to keep your
hands where I can see them.

37:36.182 --> 37:39.037
Okay? I'll bring him over for you.

37:39.038 --> 37:40.610
Okay? I'm gonna need you

37:40.611 --> 37:42.824
to put the remote
control on the dashboard

37:42.825 --> 37:45.947
and show me your hands, all right?

37:45.948 --> 37:47.581
Let's work together here.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.982
All right? Okay.

37:49.983 --> 37:51.497
Okay.

37:55.418 --> 37:56.824
Okay, okay. Now I need you
to do something for me.

37:56.825 --> 37:59.147
I need you to put the
remote on the dashboard

37:59.148 --> 38:01.036
and then your hands
where I can see them.

38:01.037 --> 38:02.291
Just like we agreed to.

38:02.292 --> 38:03.550
Okay?

38:03.551 --> 38:05.118
Okay.

38:05.119 --> 38:07.628
Come on. There you go.

38:07.629 --> 38:09.875
And you're putting your
hands where I can see them.

38:10.996 --> 38:12.816
Okay.

38:12.817 --> 38:14.583
Jacob!

38:16.654 --> 38:18.355
Jacob!

38:19.157 --> 38:20.224
Jacob!

38:22.093 --> 38:24.661
Jacob.

38:29.593 --> 38:32.388
Bomb Squad defused the device.

38:32.389 --> 38:34.236
And the mayor's
inviting you to join him

38:34.237 --> 38:36.530
the minister's press conference.

38:38.188 --> 38:40.893
Where were you on 9/11?

38:46.284 --> 38:48.573
I was with you.

38:48.574 --> 38:50.660
*** the north tower.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.629
Sorry, I was thinking out loud.

38:53.630 --> 38:55.582
I know where we were, Jim.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.949
Everybody knows where they were
when the towers went down.

39:05.002 --> 39:06.704
That was your son out there.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.927
Yes, it was.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.923
Night, Frank.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.713
Night, Jim.

39:35.502 --> 39:37.647
Pizza pie! Get it while it's hot!

39:37.648 --> 39:39.306
Hey, where is everybody?

39:39.307 --> 39:41.904
I expect Danny's filling
out a lot of reports.

39:41.905 --> 39:44.488
Yeah, I know,
but I mean the others.

39:44.489 --> 39:46.369
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, the birthday boy isn't here yet?

39:46.370 --> 39:48.454
I got him a white pie.
Yeah, they should've

39:48.455 --> 39:50.048
been here by now.

39:50.049 --> 39:52.235
I smell hot, delicious cardboard.

39:52.236 --> 39:56.365
Ah, hail the conquering hero!

39:56.366 --> 39:57.547
You wouldn't know it
from the ass-chewing

39:57.548 --> 39:58.790
I just got from my sergeant,

39:58.791 --> 39:59.916
the ESU sergeant,

39:59.917 --> 40:02.256
the SWAT team, the task force.

40:02.257 --> 40:03.716
You did good, son.

40:03.717 --> 40:06.202
If you got your ass chewed,
you deserved it.

40:06.203 --> 40:08.245
Thanks, Dad.

40:08.246 --> 40:09.474
Where's Linda and the kids?

40:09.475 --> 40:10.466
She'll be here.

40:10.467 --> 40:11.819
Hey, everybody!

40:11.820 --> 40:13.651
In here!

40:15.416 --> 40:16.638
Oh, what a day!

40:17.689 --> 40:19.217
Hey, happy birthday! I'm starving.

40:19.218 --> 40:21.043
Happy birthday! Thanks.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.667
Oh, but we had a good time,
didn't we guys? Huh?

40:23.668 --> 40:25.361
We saw polar bears,

40:25.362 --> 40:27.965
gorillas...

40:27.966 --> 40:29.531
Sorry it took so long to get here.

40:29.532 --> 40:32.816
The subway was so crowded.

40:32.817 --> 40:34.656
Some incident downtown.

40:34.657 --> 40:37.085
How about you guys,
everybody have a good day?

40:39.459 --> 40:40.892
What?

40:41.848 --> 40:43.062
Nothing. What's wrong?

40:43.063 --> 40:44.600
Come on, boys.

40:44.601 --> 40:46.791
Is everything all right? Yeah,
everything's great.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.588
How was the zoo, huh?

40:48.589 --> 40:50.556
The polar bear was giant!

40:50.557 --> 40:52.629
And the gorilla smelled like poo.

40:52.630 --> 40:54.302
Gorillas always smell like poo.

40:54.303 --> 40:56.090
Come on, sit down.

40:57.109 --> 40:58.783
Seriously...

40:58.784 --> 41:01.159
what's going on?

41:01.160 --> 41:02.543
We'll tell you all about it.

41:02.544 --> 41:05.538
Right now our pizza
needs attention.

41:05.539 --> 41:07.893
Mom, can I eat on the back porch?

41:07.894 --> 41:10.358
Uh... Frank?

41:10.359 --> 41:12.955
I didn't make up the
rules for dinner. Pop?

41:12.956 --> 41:14.109
Well, on Sundays

41:14.110 --> 41:15.487
we always eat at the dinner table.

41:15.488 --> 41:17.332
But on birthday Saturdays,

41:17.333 --> 41:18.658
anything goes.

41:18.659 --> 41:20.316
But...

41:20.317 --> 41:21.981
after grace.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.294
Grandpa, where's your cane?

41:25.295 --> 41:26.855
Well, I've ditched it.

41:26.856 --> 41:29.206
If I don't get my balance back,
how am I gonna teach

41:29.207 --> 41:33.081
my great-grandkids
how to play handball?

41:33.082 --> 41:35.164
I want to say something.

41:35.165 --> 41:37.583
We all went our separate
ways this morning,

41:37.584 --> 41:38.457
and we all

41:38.458 --> 41:42.159
expected to return to
our family to celebrate

41:42.160 --> 41:45.586
this wonderful young
man's birthday.

41:46.923 --> 41:48.963
And here we are.

41:51.659 --> 41:54.371
And I feel very blessed

41:54.372 --> 41:56.777
and fortunate for that.

41:58.167 --> 41:59.483
Well, that was kind of grace.

41:59.484 --> 42:02.145
Can I go now? Yeah. Go, go.

42:02.146 --> 42:03.669
Keep it right-side up.

42:03.670 --> 42:04.284
Okay, Mom.

42:04.285 --> 42:06.242
And don't make a mess.

42:07.822 --> 42:09.484
Jamie?

42:14.769 --> 42:18.331
Bless us, O Lord, for these
gifts we are about to receive...
