Fucking vault'’s open.
I'’m going for it.

01:44.626 --> 01:45.844
No!

01:46.410 --> 01:48.151
Let'’s go, let's go.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.154
Come on, let'’s go.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.117

02:07.083 --> 02:09.129

Go, go, go!Let'’s go, move it!

02:31.934 --> 02:33.457
Go, go, go, go!

02:33.501 --> 02:35.372
Fuck!
It'’s the cops! Shit!

02:35.416 --> 02:37.461
No, not the cops.Are you fucking
kidding me?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.289
You spent
way too much time
in the vault.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.161
We gotta fucking move.
Let'’s just go.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.163
Put the gun down!We don'’t have time.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.034
Fuck it!Fuck!

02:58.178 --> 03:00.136
We have a cop down
at Cruces and Church.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.703
Send a bus!

03:01.964 --> 03:03.574
One suspect still
in the area,

03:03.618 --> 03:05.272
on foot, heavily armed.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.667
Knight,
where the fuck you going?

03:12.453 --> 03:14.194
We need to wait
for backup.

03:19.024 --> 03:22.680
Help me please.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.814
Get a bus out here now.

03:27.163 --> 03:30.427
Bunch of kamikaze, burn-out,
born-to-lose motherfuckers.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.822
Thanks
for your expertise.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.468
This is Two-Grant-042
pulling up now to East 13th...

04:19.824 --> 04:21.130
Shots fired. Shots fired.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.224
We need backup.
East 13th, East 13th!
Right now, shots fired!

04:40.802 --> 04:42.891
Move, bitch!

04:45.154 --> 04:46.286
Move!

04:53.684 --> 04:55.599
-Drop it!
-Fuck off!

04:55.643 --> 04:58.733
She'’s got a fucking baby
in the car, man. Drop the gun.

04:58.776 --> 05:02.432
Fuck off!
I will fucking kill you.
Fuck off!

05:02.476 --> 05:04.260
Drop it. Calm down.
You'’re gonna be fine.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.480
You'’re gonna be okay.I will fucking kill her.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.264
Drop the gun, please.Get the fuck out of here!

05:08.308 --> 05:10.658
Just put it down.Get me a goddamn helicopter.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.399
Put it down.
Think about it, man.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.052
No!Drop it!

05:14.096 --> 05:16.228
No. Fuck off!

05:16.272 --> 05:17.665
Drop the gun.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.406
Drop it, old man.

05:22.670 --> 05:23.975
Put the gun down, you old fuck.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.690
Fuck.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.947
Internal Affairs
will conduct the review.
You know the drill.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.079
Thank you.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.398
What and where?

06:38.963 --> 06:40.922
This one'’s dead,
the other one'’s inside.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.010
Hey.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.407
Hello, sir.
Sir, can you hear me?

06:50.366 --> 06:51.759
Is he alive?

06:52.237 --> 06:55.023
I don'’t hear anything.
Must be the wind.

07:02.204 --> 07:03.597
Lead the way.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.165
It'’s the guy
all shot up inside.
You can'’t miss him.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.393
Officer,
I can take it from here.
Thank you.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.221
-Sir, can you hear me?
-Uh-huh.

07:19.264 --> 07:20.962
Yeah? All right.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.444
All right.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.143
Fuck!

07:28.186 --> 07:30.188
-Prep the bus.
-He'’s not gonna make it.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.758
-Come on.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.546
-Come on!

07:42.723 --> 07:45.116
Motherfucker!

07:45.160 --> 07:47.075
Oh, fuck!

07:47.118 --> 07:50.078
What? What the fuck
are you doing?Help.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.297
Fuck, Dezi!Oh, my God!

07:52.341 --> 07:55.431
Come on.Are you two fucking
old enough to be EMTs?

08:32.337 --> 08:34.557
The pulse is,
uh, 50 bpm.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
The renal artery was nicked.Prep for surgery.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.474
-Two bags O neg.
-Sir, eyes open.
Look at me.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.433
Can you tell me your name?
Tell me your name. Sir? Sir?

08:41.477 --> 08:44.567
Okay. Make a hole, make a hole.
We'’re coming through.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.657
Get the trauma surgeon in.
Where is Bradley? Get me...

08:55.447 --> 08:56.536
You okay?

09:06.197 --> 09:07.459
Can I bum a cig?

11:49.796 --> 11:53.408
-Oh. How did you find it?

11:54.061 --> 11:57.760
-Oh, where is she?
-You'’re the detective.
You tell me.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.023
You'’re right.
Once upon a time--

12:00.067 --> 12:02.373
Once upon a time,
I had a husband

12:02.417 --> 12:06.290
who didn'’t give a shit
about my feelings
or my time.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.731
I just want to talk
to my daughter.She'’s an adult.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.037
She doesn'’t have
to talk to you
if she doesn'’t want to.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.560
I'’m better than ever.
Hell--

12:15.604 --> 12:17.345
She doesn'’t want
to talk to you.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.827
Her last text
was two words: "Bite me."

12:22.698 --> 12:24.439
I'’m trying to apologize.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.443
What'’s that?

12:29.226 --> 12:30.662
What'’s it look like?

12:33.622 --> 12:34.971
She isn'’t a child.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.668
She'’ll always be my kid.

12:38.801 --> 12:42.109
Just--
You leave the bear.
I'’ll make sure she gets it.

12:43.501 --> 12:46.983
So, you were telling me
about Turks and Caicos.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.942
Hey,
don'’t worry about him.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.380
If there'’s one thing
that he'’s good at,
it'’s leaving.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.353
Thanks, everyone.

13:20.669 --> 13:23.150
"Out of the night
that covers me,

13:23.193 --> 13:25.326
black is the pit
from pole to pole.

13:26.457 --> 13:31.071
I thank whatever God may be
for my unconquerable soul.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.814
In the fell clutch
of circumstance,

13:35.858 --> 13:39.688
I have not winced
or cried aloud.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.908
Under the bludgeonings
of chance,

13:41.951 --> 13:44.693
my head is bloody
but unbowed.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.088
Beyond this place
of wrath and shade,

13:48.131 --> 13:51.526
and yet
the menace of years finds

13:51.569 --> 13:53.397
and shall find me unafraid.

13:53.441 --> 13:57.184
It matters not
how straight the gate,

13:57.227 --> 13:59.882
how charged with punishments
the scroll.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.842
I am the master
of my fate,

14:04.887 --> 14:06.758
and I am the captain
of my soul."

14:11.459 --> 14:16.986
To Officer Rebecca Flanagan
and Officer Edgar Cortez.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.901
Good cops never die,

14:18.945 --> 14:22.862
they just get promoted
to the precinct in the sky.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.169
Rest in power.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.217
To Officer Flanagan

14:30.260 --> 14:31.740
and Officer Cortez.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.874
Hear, hear.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.658
Next round is on me.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.052
Thank you.

14:41.706 --> 14:42.969
Whoo!

14:43.926 --> 14:45.754
Uh, two Budweisers.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.626
I need a drink.

14:50.759 --> 14:51.803
Waiter.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.419
Here you go, kid.
Six bucks even.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.768
Hey, asshole.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.944
The man
just saved a life.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.424
He'’s earned a free one.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.342
I hate this place.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.821
It has its charms.

15:16.828 --> 15:20.093
Fifteen bucks.You said six.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.616
Well,
with the tequila
it'’s 15.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.922
What tequila?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.533
I don'’t see any tequila.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.621
Whatever.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.843
Don'’t roofie
my drink.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.259
Captain wants me
pulling swing all week.

15:56.303 --> 16:00.350
-Tell the union.
-Hmm. I should.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.223
You know-- You know,
too many stupid people

16:03.266 --> 16:05.573
around here at this time
doing stupid things.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.488
Hey, give me the Fourth
over Halloween

16:07.531 --> 16:09.490
and Christmas any day.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.579
A couple of kids
shooting some fireworks?

16:11.622 --> 16:13.276
No biggie for me.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.149
You know, those fireworks
set off every single alarm

16:16.192 --> 16:20.109
in Teslas
and every single building
from here to Anaheim.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.503
It actually makes me
miss New York.

16:22.546 --> 16:26.768
And you'’re gonna have
to deal with so many
bullshit phone calls.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.248
Yo, Justin Bieber!

16:29.684 --> 16:31.468
You eavesdropping
right now?

16:31.512 --> 16:34.950
Yeah, um, I'’m busted.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.082
My name is Dezi. I--

16:36.125 --> 16:37.431
We don'’t give a fuck.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.351
This is a cop bar.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.920
What kind of badge
is it?

16:51.488 --> 16:52.794
EMT?

16:55.231 --> 16:57.059
You think
that means something?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.800
Yeah, so, uh,

16:58.843 --> 17:00.454
I just have to save
your sorry asses,

17:00.497 --> 17:02.108
but I can'’t have a beer
with you?

17:02.804 --> 17:04.849
Too thick to make it
as a doctor.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.070
Look, I'’ve got a lot
of respect

17:08.114 --> 17:11.334
for my, uh,
blue-blooded brothers,
right?

17:11.987 --> 17:13.119
My mother was a guard.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.426
So, your mother
was a guard?

17:16.470 --> 17:17.862
And you'’re bragging
about that?

17:17.906 --> 17:19.299
Guards.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.909
They'’re like
the Irish us.

17:20.952 --> 17:23.520
Oh, yeah.
Are you Irish, huh?

17:23.564 --> 17:25.261
Uh--

17:25.305 --> 17:27.350
I hear that,
uh, Irish girls
are very easy.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.657
How is your mother?

17:33.878 --> 17:36.881
You must have shit
for brains to step in
front of me like this.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.014
Okay.You'’re gonna have
to go.

17:39.362 --> 17:42.191
-Well, I thought this
was the land of the free.
-It ain'’t for you.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.672
Yeah.All right. I think I'’ll
finish my beer. Thank you.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.631
You have to go.Oh, great.
There'’s a baseball bat?

17:47.675 --> 17:50.895
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What is this,
like a softball league?

17:50.939 --> 17:52.506
You'’re gonna
have to go.What'’s going on?

17:52.549 --> 17:54.638
You wanna go?
Sign me up. I'’m down.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.423
Give me
the fucking baseball bat.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.841
Come on, let'’s go.
He'’s not worth it.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.827
What the fuck, Dez?

18:54.655 --> 18:56.091
I love this country.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.049
I love it.Let'’s go.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.835
Someone call the police.Mmm.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.429
Concussion?

19:30.473 --> 19:32.345
No,
you'’re just stupid.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.436
Why do you live
in this shithole?

19:37.654 --> 19:40.309
Well, you find me
a cheaper place,
and I'’ll live there.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.398
Any breaks?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.618
Nah.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.535
Shit.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.014
We'’re on deck in 50.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.799
"Oh, we'’re on deck in 50."

19:52.843 --> 19:54.889
You like my accent?

19:54.932 --> 19:56.499
It'’s about as good
as you look.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.371
You don'’t gotta go.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.155
No, no, no, no.Dez...

20:10.600 --> 20:11.645
Dez.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.652
This is the worst idea.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.481
You think too much.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.841
Why the hell
did you start a fight
in a cop bar?

22:02.103 --> 22:03.800
They'’re never gonna
let us back in there.

22:04.497 --> 22:05.541
Mmm.

22:05.585 --> 22:06.977
I want an answer.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.546
Maybe '’cause
I almost was one.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.027
One of what?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.379
I always wanted
to be a cop.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.467
Bullshit.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.382
No lie.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.124
Nearly broke
my dad'’s heart.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.692
Not exactly
a law-abiding citizen.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.129
And what happened?

22:28.825 --> 22:30.479
Well...

22:31.350 --> 22:32.699
I, uh,

22:33.526 --> 22:35.789
didn'’t exactly
make it through
the department interview.

22:35.832 --> 22:39.967
Mmm.Yeah, they said
my moral compass

22:40.010 --> 22:42.665
was skewed or whatever.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.754
You?

22:47.061 --> 22:49.063
Yeah,
I was this close, but...

22:49.890 --> 22:52.066
Yeah, I still wanted
to do some good,
you know?

22:52.632 --> 22:55.243
EMT life, baby.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.640
Probably doing more good
than those assholes, anyway.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.774
There are some good cops.
Like, most are good.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.951
Oh yeah? Well, you'll have
to introduce me to one.

23:10.519 --> 23:11.781
Maybe.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.179
I, uh, think I started
that fight.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.224
Well, first of all,
I didn'’t start the fight.

23:20.268 --> 23:23.140
Mmm. Okay.I was defending myself,
which is a big difference.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.054
Sure.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.928
I don'’t know.
I guess I just wanted to see

23:27.971 --> 23:30.931
how tough the LAPD
really was, you know?

23:30.974 --> 23:32.106
You'’re crazy.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.109
Oh,
and you'’re adorable.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.806
-Don'’t call me that.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.678
Ever.

23:38.721 --> 23:39.983
Yes, ma'’am.

23:43.509 --> 23:46.468
This was
a one-time thing.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.470
Oh, okay.
It'’s a one-time thing

23:48.514 --> 23:50.733
and then it'’s a--
until it'’s a two-time thing.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.083
And then it'’s
a three-time thing, okay?

23:53.127 --> 23:54.433
And then it'’s
a four-time thing.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.825
You think
you'’re so charming.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.470
Get the Narcan.
Stay with us.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.239
Did Kyle shove you?

26:29.892 --> 26:31.590
What did I say?

26:31.633 --> 26:34.462
If someone shoves you,
you punch '’em.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.812
If they pull a knife,
you pull a gun.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.859
If they bring a tank,
call me. All right?

26:40.773 --> 26:42.426
Kyle.
Get over here.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.604
Get up.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.259
You'’ve been pushing him
around again?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.655
Milton,
you know what to do.

26:53.699 --> 26:54.743
Go on.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.007
Shake hands.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.663
All good?

27:02.142 --> 27:03.186
Go on.

27:08.104 --> 27:10.324
What did I say to you
about slouching?

27:16.330 --> 27:18.332
Easy on the spread,
it has to last a month.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.855
Mmm.

27:22.118 --> 27:25.426
You know, your mother
would turn in her grave
if she saw the world now.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.385
This isn'’t the country
it once was.

27:29.517 --> 27:32.085
Small miracles,
that'’s all we can hope for.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.218
You know, every gang
in Long Beach is trying

27:35.262 --> 27:37.177
to get their hands
on those kids.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.266
We feed them,
get tutors for them.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.224
This shelter,

27:42.051 --> 27:43.662
it'’s a legacy.

27:43.705 --> 27:47.970
As long as it stays open,
her memory will last.

27:49.798 --> 27:52.061
Mom would be proud
of you, Dad.

27:52.105 --> 27:55.674
Yeah, well,
pride isn'’t a luxury
I-- I can afford, you know?

27:58.459 --> 28:00.896
Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.

28:03.638 --> 28:04.813
We'’ve been defunded.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.121
Yeah.
Budget cuts,

28:08.164 --> 28:10.689
that'’s what they say,
because of the riots last year.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.909
The state doesn'’t get it,
you know?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.868
Save a kid,
you save the future.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.962
Anyway,
I got to get to business.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.528
Um, do you want me
to tell the kids

28:24.572 --> 28:25.791
-the youth center'’s closed?
-No.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.444
I invited them.

28:28.837 --> 28:31.710
They'’re gonna help
with creative ways
to keep the lights on.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.761
Come on, buddy.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.415
Everything in your life

28:41.458 --> 28:43.373
has been leading up
to this moment.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.202
It'’s the opinion
of the department

28:46.246 --> 28:48.248
that why someone enters
law enforcement

28:48.291 --> 28:51.468
is as important
as the work they do
on a daily basis.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.296
Why do I wanna be a cop?

28:57.605 --> 28:58.867
I like doughnuts.

29:00.521 --> 29:01.565
Gun fights.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.960
-Car chases.
-Okay, okay.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.006
This isn'’t
your first time
in here.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.442
That'’s right.

29:08.485 --> 29:11.227
But this is a safe space.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.577
You were given a second chance
after New York,

29:13.621 --> 29:17.190
and we need to make sure
you don'’t slip
into your old cowboy ways.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.673
I can'’t tell your captain
that you'’re safe to go back
on the streets

29:22.717 --> 29:24.937
unless I know you'’re not
a danger to yourself
or others,

29:24.980 --> 29:26.765
that'’s bottom line.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.681
Look,
I gave my statement.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.510
It was a good shooting.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.913
I feel better.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.523
Tell me the truth.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.438
Why do you wanna be a cop?

29:50.745 --> 29:52.965
I want my daughter
to be safe.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.056
To be proud of me.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.757
Now your father,
he was a bank manager
in Newark.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.933
Can you just tell me
a little bit about him?

30:04.977 --> 30:07.806
He was shot during
an attempted robbery,
is that right?

30:11.722 --> 30:12.811
We'’re done.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.391
Dezi? Dezi? Report to the
supervisor office.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.412
Boss?

30:49.456 --> 30:50.718
Dezi, take a seat.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.160
I got a witness from
the Beston Bank robbery

30:58.204 --> 31:01.294
that says you refused
to offer medical assistance.

31:02.817 --> 31:03.862
Triage.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.647
This isn'’t a war zone.

31:07.953 --> 31:11.391
Would you rather me
save the villain
or the victim?

31:11.434 --> 31:12.958
I read your report.

31:13.001 --> 31:15.438
Yes. We arrived
on the scene, right?

31:15.482 --> 31:17.658
We went past the dead cop.

31:17.701 --> 31:20.922
I made a judgment call,
and then we went
into the manager'’s office.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.794
You broke protocol
carrying him out like that.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.275
I saved the guy'’s life.

31:26.319 --> 31:30.236
He'’s suing the city and you
for emotional trauma

31:30.279 --> 31:33.195
sustained during
emergency transportation.

31:33.239 --> 31:36.372
-Get the fuck out of here.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.682
-You'’re suspended.
-What?

31:41.725 --> 31:43.379
Dezi.I did nothing wrong.

31:43.423 --> 31:44.772
Take a few weeks.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.861
Let legal come
to a resolution,

31:47.775 --> 31:49.211
it'’ll blow over.

31:49.255 --> 31:52.432
That'’s not fucking fair!

31:52.475 --> 31:54.695
You think you can talk
to me like this?

31:56.436 --> 31:57.480
Fuck it.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.483
You'’re fired
for insubordination

32:00.527 --> 32:03.965
and refusing
to offer medical assistance
to someone in need.

32:04.009 --> 32:07.273
You can'’t fire me.Your contract
is terminated now.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.450
You can'’t fire me,
because I'’m the best fucking
para you fucking got.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.630
You fire me, and you hurt
the whole fucking city.

32:16.673 --> 32:17.979
Big fucking whoop.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.589
Get out of my office.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.696
Right now,
we live in a society

33:22.739 --> 33:26.134
where there'’s one rule for us,
and another rule for them.

33:26.178 --> 33:30.312
That'’s not just here.
That'’s all over the world.
That'’s spreading right now.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.661
That'’s the pandemic.

33:34.099 --> 33:37.580
We are not judged, people.

33:37.624 --> 33:41.106
The rich, the famous,
all of them,
they have their agenda.

33:41.149 --> 33:44.152
They decide what'’s right
and what'’s wrong.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.719
But we know what'’s right.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.374
We know what'’s right.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.901
You see Portland?

33:53.944 --> 33:57.209
The world is gonna look
exactly like Portland

33:57.252 --> 33:59.124
if we don'’t have heroes.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.343
The world needs heroes.

34:04.346 --> 34:07.088
Cops have
the hardest job in the world.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.743
This city
is tearing itself apart,

34:09.786 --> 34:13.138
and cops are our last line
of defense.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.970
We need cops
who don'’t care
about red tape.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.451
Who don'’t care
about the politics

34:22.495 --> 34:27.108
and who'’s
gonna become mayor
or a four-year term limit.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.154
Defund the police?

34:29.197 --> 34:33.027
Right, yeah,
sure, great idea.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.160
Defund the police,
and then see who comes
to the rescue

34:35.203 --> 34:37.640
when cartels
are running free.

34:37.684 --> 34:41.122
When you can'’t
even get a cup of coffee
without getting mugged.

34:46.345 --> 34:50.131
Who cares about
how people go to jail?

34:50.175 --> 34:53.439
You will never see
all the good things
that the cops do.

34:53.482 --> 34:58.270
You will never see them
breaking up
domestic violence incidents,

34:58.313 --> 35:02.448
organizing, uh, food drives,
because that'’s
not good content.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.152
Defund it, yeah.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.371
Cool, I'’ll wait.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.151
Hey Boots, come here.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.241
What have you got going on
the morning of the Fourth?

39:34.284 --> 39:36.112
I'’m headed to the beach
with my girl, sir.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.636
I'’ve been looking forward
to it all week.

39:39.072 --> 39:42.423
We're looking for volunteers
for the At-Risk Shelter.

39:42.467 --> 39:46.688
Setting up, you know food,
cleaning, you know.Yeah.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.649
I can'’t force you
to say yes.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.783
But I can tell the sergeant
that you declined.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.222
I would love to,
but we'’ve been planning this
for a month.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.616
I got to pick her mom up
at the airport.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.057
Fine. Give it to me.

40:11.757 --> 40:14.107
Serve and protect.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.416
Well,
this is me serving.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.593
I'’m gonna need you
to protect me

40:21.636 --> 40:22.811
from my girlfriend.

40:23.725 --> 40:24.857
Thank you.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.033
You think I'’m kidding.

40:36.956 --> 40:40.829
But I ask this,
"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"

40:40.873 --> 40:42.570
Who watches the watchers?

40:43.658 --> 40:45.007
Answer:

40:45.051 --> 40:46.835
Too many people.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.620
Police can'’t effectively uh,

40:48.663 --> 40:50.491
do their job
with this level of scrutiny

40:50.535 --> 40:52.624
from the media
and, uh, the public.

40:52.667 --> 40:56.366
I say cops don'’t do enough.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.546
They need a ghost,
someone that can
take out the trash

41:01.589 --> 41:04.200
and doesn'’t have to worry
about the red tape.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.376
I'’m not talking about,
uh, a vigilante.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.987
I'’m talking more of a...

41:12.339 --> 41:13.688
Angel of Justice.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.303
...vigilante.
I'’m talking more
of a...

41:20.347 --> 41:21.740
Angel of Justice.

41:21.783 --> 41:23.132
Angel of Justice.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.612
Angel of Justice.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.614
Justice. Justice.
Justice.

41:26.658 --> 41:29.791
Justice. Justice. Justice.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.227
Angel of Justice.

41:43.892 --> 41:47.156
Knight! My office, now.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.555
Hey, boss.Shut up.

41:54.599 --> 41:55.861
Yes, ma'’am.

41:58.124 --> 41:59.952
What are you working?Paperwork.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.780
No thanks to you.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.173
Good. Here'’s some more.

42:04.217 --> 42:07.046
Someone stole a uniform,
badge, gun--

42:07.089 --> 42:08.830
the whole shebang--
from the coroner'’s office

42:08.874 --> 42:10.571
down at North Roads Hospital.

42:11.267 --> 42:12.878
Family wants the badge back.

42:12.921 --> 42:15.141
IA wants the gun
and I want to know

42:15.184 --> 42:18.100
what kind of degenerate
would do such a thing.

42:18.144 --> 42:20.625
-No security cameras?
-Nope, no.

42:20.668 --> 42:22.757
Privacy reasons.Privacy?

42:22.801 --> 42:25.020
The customers are dead.

42:25.064 --> 42:27.545
That means you'’re gonna have
to do a little leg work.

42:27.588 --> 42:30.939
And by the looks of things,
you could do with getting
in some more steps.

42:30.983 --> 42:32.288
Ouch.

42:32.332 --> 42:34.073
Just calling it like I see it.

42:35.988 --> 42:37.555
You sleeping all right?

42:37.598 --> 42:39.426
Ah, thank you
for noticing.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.036
It was a late night.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.603
Narcotics Unit intercepted

42:42.647 --> 42:45.606
a couple of tons of coke
and some women.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.130
-Cartel shit?
-Oh, they wish.

42:48.174 --> 42:49.784
No, it was the Vampos Gang.

42:49.828 --> 42:52.134
I guess all the names
were-- were taken.

42:54.136 --> 42:58.227
Oh hey, congrats on the divorce.

42:58.271 --> 43:02.014
I'’m a free man.Yeah, well, uh,
your ring finger may be free,

43:02.057 --> 43:04.103
but your ass still belongs
to the department.

43:05.234 --> 43:06.279
Mmm.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.282
Don'’t I know it.

43:10.022 --> 43:11.371
How'’s your daughter?

43:12.546 --> 43:14.243
She'’s fine.Uh...

43:14.287 --> 43:17.029
Fine is not the F word
I would use

43:17.072 --> 43:18.465
to describe your daughter.

43:19.422 --> 43:21.773
But then again hey,
I mean she'’s got
a dad like you

43:21.816 --> 43:23.252
and a mom like Camilla.

43:24.079 --> 43:27.648
A shrink could diagnose
those daddy issues
three states away.

43:27.692 --> 43:29.737
Did somebody piss
in your coffee?

43:29.781 --> 43:31.913
I'’m just saying

43:31.957 --> 43:36.265
that there'’s a way
to balance out work
and home life.

43:36.309 --> 43:39.747
How many husbands have you had?I didn'’t say I knew
how to balance it out.

43:39.791 --> 43:42.271
I'’m just saying there is a way.

43:42.315 --> 43:44.143
You know, I mean look at Fitz.

43:44.186 --> 43:45.492
Fitz is a good boy.

43:45.535 --> 43:46.667
He'’s whipped.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.887
That is true.

43:50.018 --> 43:51.367
He'’s a good cop though.

43:51.411 --> 43:53.021
What makes you say that?

43:53.065 --> 43:54.893
There'’s none finer.

43:54.936 --> 43:56.590
No, I'’m-- I'm curious now.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.811
What do you think makes
a good cop?

44:01.160 --> 44:05.773
A good cop doesn'’t sleep well,
so everyone else can.

44:07.079 --> 44:08.167
I'’ll accept that.

44:10.256 --> 44:12.301
Oh, ah, one last thing.

44:12.345 --> 44:13.955
You and Fitz are working
the Fourth.

44:15.087 --> 44:16.523
I'’m going camping.

44:16.566 --> 44:17.872
Camping?

44:18.656 --> 44:20.005
Yeah. I got a cabin.

44:20.048 --> 44:23.051
Uh, that'’s not camping.

44:23.095 --> 44:25.010
Not unless
I get time off.

44:25.619 --> 44:26.794
The Fourth?

44:28.013 --> 44:29.884
That'’s my favorite day.

44:29.928 --> 44:32.017
And I expect you
to protect and serve

44:32.060 --> 44:33.671
with a smile on your face.

44:35.107 --> 44:36.369
Thank you, Knight.

44:55.954 --> 45:00.741
Pensions are
our specialty. Your future
is safe. I bank here.

45:00.785 --> 45:03.396
Set up an account
so we can get you
some nice compound interest

45:03.439 --> 45:05.877
or maybe an investment account
would be better for you.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.270
How much do you--
Investment account?
Okay, that'’s fine.

45:08.314 --> 45:10.969
Officer.
What can I do for you?

45:11.012 --> 45:13.406
I, uh...

45:16.844 --> 45:18.846
Are you here
to do a 6-8-9?

45:19.847 --> 45:21.631
Yes. Yeah.

45:21.675 --> 45:22.937
Miss Gakowski.

45:22.981 --> 45:24.156
The officer...

45:24.199 --> 45:25.853
...wants to do a 6-8-9.

45:29.770 --> 45:30.902
Are you okay, Officer?

45:32.991 --> 45:34.732
Your uniform looks
kind of wonky.

45:35.645 --> 45:38.561
Call the union.
The department should not
be sending you out like that.

45:40.781 --> 45:44.176
Do I know you?
Were you here that night
those tweaker assholes

45:44.219 --> 45:45.394
made a run at my vault?

45:46.395 --> 45:49.007
Yeah. I mean,
I-- I heard about that.

45:49.050 --> 45:52.358
My ass was almost cooked,
but you boys saved my life.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.969
I'’m sure those paramedics
did a good job, too.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.712
It was the blue bloods
and the doctors
at Saint Mary'’s.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.279
They'’re the heroes.

46:03.456 --> 46:04.849
Are you part
of the 14th?

46:07.155 --> 46:10.855
I have a guy whose father
used to be the night commander.

46:10.898 --> 46:11.943
James Jayne?

46:12.900 --> 46:14.423
Oh, yeah, sure.

46:14.467 --> 46:15.642
You know him?

46:16.730 --> 46:17.775
Yeah.

46:18.471 --> 46:19.515
Good man.

46:20.081 --> 46:21.082
I thought he died.

46:21.126 --> 46:22.301
Well, you know...

46:23.868 --> 46:25.043
cops never die.

46:27.349 --> 46:28.568
Amen, brother.

46:28.611 --> 46:30.439
Blue lives never die.

46:30.483 --> 46:32.833
Thank you
for what you do.

46:32.877 --> 46:34.704
So, do you have any plans
for the Fourth?

46:34.748 --> 46:37.011
Ah, you know,
uh, the usual.

46:37.055 --> 46:39.405
Ah, yeah,
work never ceases.

46:39.448 --> 46:42.974
I can relate.
I will be here
toiling away.

46:43.539 --> 46:44.845
But I love it.

46:44.889 --> 46:46.281
There'’s nothing
more American

46:46.325 --> 46:48.588
than making money
on the Fourth.

46:56.901 --> 46:59.120
Jesus Christ.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.079
Come on.Sir.

47:20.533 --> 47:21.577
Have at it.

47:34.764 --> 47:35.853
Yeah.

47:38.638 --> 47:41.510
We'’ve been defunded.

47:41.554 --> 47:43.904
Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.

47:47.342 --> 47:48.561
Go, go, go.

47:50.389 --> 47:53.218
Everybody down!
Down on the ground!

47:54.959 --> 47:56.351
Get down!
Oh, my God!

48:04.751 --> 48:08.059
-You, back to the register
right now!
-William, hang-- hang on.

48:08.102 --> 48:09.625
Let'’s go, let's go!

48:16.154 --> 48:17.590
Let'’s go!
Empty the register!

48:24.858 --> 48:26.904
Fucking vault'’s open.
I'’m going for it.

48:32.997 --> 48:34.128
Stay down!

48:41.483 --> 48:43.746
Let'’s go.
Stay on the ground.
You, against the wall!

48:44.443 --> 48:45.661
Get your head down!

48:47.011 --> 48:48.664
Let'’s go.
Stay on the fucking ground!

48:50.057 --> 48:53.843
Shit! Ah! Fuck!
You all right?

48:53.887 --> 48:55.106
I said no vault!

48:55.845 --> 48:57.325
Look at all
this fucking cash!

48:57.369 --> 48:58.805
I'’m fucking shot, dude.

48:58.848 --> 49:00.720
Well, then hurry
the fuck up and help me.

49:00.763 --> 49:03.070
Fuck you!
You greedy fuck,
get the money!

49:03.114 --> 49:05.812
You wanna fucking
get out of here,
get the fucking money. Fuck!

49:16.649 --> 49:19.478
Don'’t fucking move.
No cell phones, nothing.

49:19.521 --> 49:21.871
Nobody move.
I'’ll take that.
Thank you very much.

49:23.656 --> 49:26.398
Fuck it. Let'’s go, you cry baby.
-Goddamn it!

49:44.894 --> 49:46.287
Damn.

49:46.331 --> 49:47.462
Stay down!

49:56.123 --> 49:58.517
This shelter,
it'’s a legacy.

49:59.039 --> 50:03.130
As long as it stays open,
her memory will last.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.005
All clear.

50:09.876 --> 50:10.920
Good man.

50:31.289 --> 50:33.378
Officer! Officer,
please, you have to help me!

50:33.421 --> 50:35.423
You have
to help me.Um--

50:35.467 --> 50:36.859
You have to help me.
Please, my husband.
He'’s--

50:36.903 --> 50:38.122
No, I'’m not a, uh--Officer!

50:38.165 --> 50:39.210
No, I'’m off-duty.

50:39.775 --> 50:41.603
What?
What kind of cop
are you?

50:41.647 --> 50:44.041
Okay, I need you to--
I need you to calm down.

50:44.084 --> 50:45.346
Huh?

50:47.261 --> 50:48.306
Um...

50:50.047 --> 50:52.397
Okay, look,
I need you to calm down.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.485
Okay?

50:55.269 --> 50:57.054
Where is he?He'’s over here.

50:57.619 --> 50:58.664
Okay.

51:02.668 --> 51:04.104
He'’s here.
He'’s over here.

51:04.148 --> 51:06.063
They'’re over there.
Over here.

51:11.677 --> 51:14.245
You'’re weak...

51:22.079 --> 51:23.080
Hands up!

51:25.343 --> 51:26.866
Yeah, hands!

51:32.045 --> 51:33.046
Go.

51:33.612 --> 51:34.656
Get out of here!

51:35.788 --> 51:37.224
Now,
hands against the wall.

51:38.530 --> 51:40.053
Now!

51:44.188 --> 51:46.015
All right.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.060
Now, spread '’em.

51:48.192 --> 51:52.239
All right,
now you all have the right

51:53.414 --> 51:54.720
to remain silent.

51:55.938 --> 51:57.157
And anything...

51:58.202 --> 51:59.203
What'’s this?

51:59.855 --> 52:01.814
This? Huh?

52:05.383 --> 52:09.561
...you say
will be used against you

52:09.604 --> 52:10.953
in the court of law.

52:17.351 --> 52:20.746
-That'’s it.
Kick his ass.
-Yeah, kick his ass.

52:32.236 --> 52:33.237
No.

52:34.063 --> 52:35.369
No, no.

52:37.937 --> 52:40.679
Uh, all right.

52:40.722 --> 52:41.984
Oh, no.

52:45.249 --> 52:49.166
This is what happens
when you do not show respect.

52:51.211 --> 52:53.344
I am an officer
of the law.

52:58.044 --> 52:59.263
Okay, get on your knees.

53:00.786 --> 53:02.701
Get on your knees
and kiss the ground!

53:02.744 --> 53:04.050
Kiss the ground.

53:04.616 --> 53:05.878
Kiss it!

53:06.792 --> 53:08.228
Comply and you'’ll survive.

53:08.794 --> 53:09.838
Okay.

53:11.405 --> 53:12.493
No.

53:20.197 --> 53:22.460
I mean, answer me this.

53:22.503 --> 53:26.246
You guys think the world
would be a better place

53:26.290 --> 53:27.552
without you in it?

53:27.595 --> 53:28.640
Huh?

53:29.641 --> 53:30.685
I mean,
what do you do?

53:30.729 --> 53:32.644
No, man. No. No.

53:32.687 --> 53:34.907
Make this country better
than it was yesterday.

53:38.650 --> 53:40.391
I got your answer
right here.

53:52.141 --> 53:57.669
If they had had complied,
they would have been alive.

54:26.828 --> 54:28.308
Hello?

54:28.352 --> 54:29.570
Who is it?

54:33.008 --> 54:35.533
You won'’t believe
the day I fucking had.

54:36.925 --> 54:37.970
What happened?

54:47.414 --> 54:49.068
Some guy dressed up
as a cop

54:49.111 --> 54:50.722
shot four guys
in Van Nuys.

54:51.549 --> 54:52.593
Not one made it.

54:54.900 --> 54:56.467
Did they find
the shooter?

54:56.510 --> 54:58.295
Not yet.
But they will.

54:58.338 --> 55:00.297
I mean,
guy was dressed up as a cop

55:00.340 --> 55:02.908
acting like
he was gonna arrest them.

55:02.951 --> 55:05.258
The police don'’t know shit
about his motive.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.303
Damn.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.785
It isn'’t fair.

55:13.310 --> 55:15.529
Well,
maybe it'’ll keep the cops
on their toes.

55:17.096 --> 55:18.402
Shake things up a bit.

55:21.056 --> 55:22.406
Don'’t say that, man.

55:24.103 --> 55:25.147
Why?

55:26.671 --> 55:28.412
Oh, you think they care
about us?

55:29.935 --> 55:32.633
The sons pay
for the sins
of their fathers.

55:32.677 --> 55:33.982
Nothing'’s changed.

55:35.114 --> 55:36.158
Okay?

55:36.898 --> 55:38.683
My father taught me that.

55:38.726 --> 55:41.250
I remember the day
that I told him
I wanted to be a cop.

55:41.294 --> 55:43.949
And he gave me
the biggest backhand
of my life,

55:43.992 --> 55:45.864
and knocked me down
on the floor.

55:48.519 --> 55:52.044
Told me the cops
are our enemies.

55:52.653 --> 55:56.091
And, uh, you know,
they'’re just pigs.

55:57.832 --> 56:02.968
Descendants from slave owners
who prosecuted runaway slaves.

56:03.011 --> 56:06.493
Like the War of Independence,
uh, that'’s for
this country'’s taxes

56:06.537 --> 56:09.975
and the American Civil War,
well, that'’s like,

56:10.018 --> 56:13.935
you know,
they freed the slaves,
but no one'’s really free.

56:13.979 --> 56:15.546
We'’re not free.

56:15.589 --> 56:17.548
We--
We'’ll never be free.

56:19.245 --> 56:23.902
Doesn'’t matter who we are,
they'’ll sell us the same
fucking American dream.

56:23.945 --> 56:27.296
And it'’s sad.
It-- It'’s so sad.

56:27.340 --> 56:28.820
It'’s just--

56:28.863 --> 56:30.430
It'’s about money.

56:30.474 --> 56:34.173
And guys like,
what, Sean Beston?

56:34.216 --> 56:37.089
You know, he'’s--
he'’s just a--
He'’s a slave owner.

56:38.525 --> 56:39.570
And the cops?

56:40.832 --> 56:41.920
His goons.

56:43.312 --> 56:45.010
I'’m sorry
you feel that way.

56:45.880 --> 56:46.925
Yeah.

56:47.621 --> 56:49.057
It is what it is.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.760
I-- I thought
I got over this
a long time ago.

57:03.681 --> 57:04.725
See you.

57:48.290 --> 57:51.337
Vinny,
where'’s the fucking money?

57:52.294 --> 57:55.210
Who'’s this guy?
Didn'’t know
he'’s a fucking cop.

57:58.300 --> 58:00.259
No son of mine
is a cop.

58:01.173 --> 58:02.653
What the fuck
you wearing, son?

58:04.219 --> 58:06.700
It'’s not the uniform
that makes the man.

58:06.744 --> 58:08.528
The man that makes
his own luck.

58:08.572 --> 58:11.096
Don'’t throw
my fucking words
back in my face.

58:12.227 --> 58:14.665
Halloween is next October.

58:14.708 --> 58:15.927
You can dress up then.

58:16.971 --> 58:18.016
You want to help?

58:19.017 --> 58:20.497
Start with meal prep.

58:21.193 --> 58:22.237
Well...

58:23.978 --> 58:25.458
we can change the world.

58:28.417 --> 58:32.726
I mean, cops,
they lock up kids every day,
but this?

58:32.770 --> 58:34.206
This is real.

58:34.467 --> 58:37.949
This shelter stops kids
from becoming these two.

58:38.993 --> 58:40.212
This is our chance.

58:42.388 --> 58:43.955
How long before the, uh--

58:43.998 --> 58:45.957
the lights go out
in this place for good?

58:46.000 --> 58:48.525
Where there'’s a will,
there'’s a way.

58:48.568 --> 58:50.004
I'’m talking
about real action.

58:51.092 --> 58:53.747
You know? A real way
to make change.

58:54.879 --> 58:56.924
Maybe your new associates
can help.

58:58.491 --> 58:59.536
Go on.

59:01.538 --> 59:04.410
Beston Bank and Trust.

59:04.976 --> 59:05.977
What about it?

59:07.239 --> 59:10.938
Their security system,
it'’s all over the place.

59:10.982 --> 59:12.549
The guards,
they'’re arrogant.

59:12.592 --> 59:15.073
I-- I can get us in.

59:15.595 --> 59:16.640
So?

59:22.602 --> 59:23.603
We hit it.

59:27.825 --> 59:29.217
When you look outside,

59:29.261 --> 59:32.307
I mean, do you see
the American dream,

59:32.351 --> 59:33.831
or do you see
someone else'’s?

59:34.962 --> 59:38.270
Embarrass the city
and make some cheese?

59:39.619 --> 59:41.012
I can fuck with that.

59:48.759 --> 59:51.065
We live in a society
where there is nothing

59:52.458 --> 59:54.460
more American
than making money

59:55.548 --> 59:57.115
on the Fourth of July.

1:00:12.478 --> 1:00:14.872
Casey Rhodes should
be rotting in jail.

1:00:14.915 --> 1:00:16.874
Could you be positive
for once?

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:19.659
Hey, I'’m a fountain
of good vibes,
brother Knight.

1:00:21.356 --> 1:00:26.274
If it isn'’t dumb and dumber.
Barney Rubble and this caveman.

1:00:26.318 --> 1:00:27.711
What'’s his name again?

1:00:27.972 --> 1:00:30.191
Can'’t believe you forgot
Fred'’s name.

1:00:33.804 --> 1:00:35.544
Come on,
we'’re on soft duty.

1:00:36.415 --> 1:00:40.506
-That isn'’t real.
-Ah, soft duty
is one beer above hard duty,

1:00:40.549 --> 1:00:42.116
and three below "let'’s party."

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:43.683
Fucking degenerates.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.467
One of you should be in jail,

1:00:45.511 --> 1:00:46.904
and the other in the chair.

1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:48.862
Have you got a problem?

1:00:48.906 --> 1:00:51.735
If I did,
what would you do?

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:04.878
Happy Fourth.

1:01:04.922 --> 1:01:05.966
Yeah.

1:01:06.010 --> 1:01:08.316
Thank you, douche bags.

1:01:12.451 --> 1:01:13.495
Shit!

1:01:14.627 --> 1:01:16.716
I'’ll meet you in the car.

1:01:26.334 --> 1:01:29.337
All right, let'’s do this.

1:01:29.947 --> 1:01:30.948
You ready?

1:01:34.821 --> 1:01:37.171
You lucky son of a bitch.

1:01:38.042 --> 1:01:40.697
One time I'’d rather
still be in the chair.

1:01:44.265 --> 1:01:45.310
Hey!

1:01:46.354 --> 1:01:47.747
You guys know you'’re going
to jail

1:01:47.791 --> 1:01:49.140
for the rest
of your lives, right?

1:01:49.183 --> 1:01:50.576
Well, I--

1:01:52.839 --> 1:01:54.058
All right,
I'’m just playing.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.234
All right,
what do you got here?

1:01:56.277 --> 1:01:57.626
What is that,
a Roman candle?

1:01:58.236 --> 1:01:59.846
Let me see that thing.

1:01:59.890 --> 1:02:03.458
Listen,
if you guys are gonna
light these off...

1:02:03.502 --> 1:02:06.200
...you gotta be safe
about it.

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:09.900
-Because you could do
some real damage

1:02:09.943 --> 1:02:11.945
with one of these things.
You understand?

1:02:11.989 --> 1:02:13.991
I want you to point '’em
in the air.

1:02:14.034 --> 1:02:16.645
Not at people,
not at animals,
not at dogs.

1:02:16.689 --> 1:02:19.518
You understand?
If I see you pointing this
at a dog,

1:02:19.561 --> 1:02:22.086
I'’m gonna curb stomp you
in front of your grandmother.

1:02:22.129 --> 1:02:24.218
Do you understand?
All right, good.

1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:39.190
Oh. Mmm.

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:43.585
Whoo!Yes?

1:02:43.629 --> 1:02:45.674
Did you speak with her?

1:02:45.936 --> 1:02:48.329
She will reach out
whenever she'’s ready
to talk to you.

1:02:48.982 --> 1:02:52.072
Just want to make sure
that she'’s okay.

1:02:52.116 --> 1:02:53.813
Just tell me
where she'’s living.

1:02:53.857 --> 1:02:55.902
She'’s got a boyfriend. I--

1:02:55.946 --> 1:02:58.122
What? Who?

1:02:58.165 --> 1:03:02.561
Oh, don'’t go
all super-dad now.

1:03:03.127 --> 1:03:04.911
If not now, when?

1:03:05.738 --> 1:03:07.000
How'’s the new guy?

1:03:07.609 --> 1:03:09.524
You don'’t get
to ask questions like that.

1:03:09.568 --> 1:03:11.048
I'’m just saying.

1:03:12.658 --> 1:03:15.400
You can do better.

1:03:15.443 --> 1:03:19.056
If he treats you right,
I'’ll support that.

1:03:19.099 --> 1:03:25.540
All I want is for you
and our girl
to be happy and safe.

1:03:27.151 --> 1:03:28.456
That'’s all.

1:03:29.631 --> 1:03:33.897
Do you think we, uh,
could have, uh, ever worked?

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:36.377
You put the job first.

1:03:36.421 --> 1:03:38.858
And I'’m not blaming you,
I'’m not.

1:03:39.467 --> 1:03:40.860
Just the hours.

1:03:40.904 --> 1:03:42.819
It was no way
to raise a family.

1:03:47.693 --> 1:03:51.871
We were like,
uh, ships passing
through the night.

1:03:51.915 --> 1:03:53.046
Yeah.

1:03:53.699 --> 1:03:56.267
Yeah, we were going
for the same--

1:03:56.310 --> 1:03:57.834
Yeah, the same iceberg.

1:03:59.139 --> 1:04:00.837
Hey, did you give her the bear?

1:04:02.186 --> 1:04:03.840
When I see her,
I will.

1:04:04.928 --> 1:04:06.799
Happy Fourth, Detective.

1:04:14.111 --> 1:04:15.764
Hey, honey.Hi.

1:04:22.771 --> 1:04:24.861
Dad'’s been trying
to get a hold of you.

1:04:24.904 --> 1:04:25.862
Why?

1:04:26.688 --> 1:04:27.951
He'’s your father.

1:04:30.475 --> 1:04:33.739
And fathers do care about
the well-being
of their children.

1:04:34.435 --> 1:04:35.784
Occasionally.

1:04:42.052 --> 1:04:44.097
He'’s sorry he missed
your birthday.

1:04:44.141 --> 1:04:47.927
Yeah, and didn'’t he get me
this exact same one
last year?

1:04:47.971 --> 1:04:50.016
You'’re his little princess.

1:04:50.060 --> 1:04:51.800
Whatever.

1:04:52.932 --> 1:04:54.325
Thank you.

1:05:04.248 --> 1:05:06.641
Okay. Oh.

1:05:06.685 --> 1:05:09.035
You are
your father'’s child.

1:05:09.079 --> 1:05:11.559
Mm-hmm.You happy now?

1:05:11.603 --> 1:05:13.518
Yeah, three more of those
and I will be.

1:05:13.561 --> 1:05:18.566
Mm-hmm.
And nice of you
to dress up, too.

1:05:20.220 --> 1:05:21.352
I'’m on call.

1:05:25.225 --> 1:05:26.531
Wanna do shots?

1:05:28.402 --> 1:05:29.447
No.

1:05:30.143 --> 1:05:32.580
These are Mike'’s work friends.

1:05:32.624 --> 1:05:34.408
Oh, yeah.Mm-hmm.

1:05:34.452 --> 1:05:36.193
We wouldn'’t want
to embarrass him.

1:05:36.236 --> 1:05:37.585
Mm-mmm.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:42.677
Okay.

1:05:45.245 --> 1:05:46.768
To being a problem child.

1:05:46.812 --> 1:05:48.205
Oh, no.

1:05:48.248 --> 1:05:49.858
To good parenting.

1:05:55.255 --> 1:05:56.996
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.Oh.

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:58.824
Oh. Why did you
make me do that?

1:05:58.867 --> 1:06:00.173
That'’s so good.No.

1:06:00.217 --> 1:06:01.392
Yeah.No.

1:06:01.914 --> 1:06:03.220
Go, Mom. Go, Mom.

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:04.308
Yeah!

1:06:56.969 --> 1:06:58.536
Happy Fourth, Officer.
Happy Fourth.

1:06:58.579 --> 1:07:00.233
-Indeed.
-What can I do for you?

1:07:01.104 --> 1:07:03.062
I'’m here to do a 6-8-9.

1:07:03.976 --> 1:07:05.456
Well,
we'’ve never been better.

1:07:06.152 --> 1:07:07.719
Well, I, um--

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.155
I'’m just here
to check up on you, sir.

1:07:10.069 --> 1:07:13.072
Well, that'’s very kind of you.
But all is well. All is well.

1:07:13.116 --> 1:07:16.162
You'’d be doing me a favor
if you let me inside,
so I can see for myself.

1:07:16.206 --> 1:07:18.251
What are you doing?
Oh, you!
Hey, there'’s two back there!

1:07:18.295 --> 1:07:20.384
-Fucker--
-Want to let me inside?

1:07:20.427 --> 1:07:22.603
Fucker! Stay back!

1:07:22.647 --> 1:07:24.388
Stay back,
you motherfuckers!

1:07:25.911 --> 1:07:27.260
Drop it, drop it.

1:07:27.304 --> 1:07:28.696
Get back!

1:07:28.740 --> 1:07:30.394
Put your weapons down!

1:07:30.437 --> 1:07:32.048
Back! Get--

1:07:32.091 --> 1:07:33.266
Open it up.

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:36.052
Open up! Open it up!

1:07:44.712 --> 1:07:48.629
I am about to live
my American dream.

1:07:50.588 --> 1:07:52.720
Mr. Beston,
please stay where you are.

1:07:52.764 --> 1:07:55.288
Guards, put down your guns.
You'’re free to go.

1:08:07.822 --> 1:08:08.954
Fuck it!

1:08:19.225 --> 1:08:20.835
You'’re fucking crazy.

1:08:22.054 --> 1:08:23.534
Do you remember me?

1:08:23.577 --> 1:08:25.492
Tell me who I am.

1:08:27.059 --> 1:08:29.017
Tell me who I am.

1:08:30.018 --> 1:08:31.803
Tell me who I am!

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:42.118
Still don'’t, huh?

1:09:07.795 --> 1:09:10.929
Silent alarm triggered
at Beston Bank.

1:09:10.972 --> 1:09:12.974
Possible 211 in progress.

1:09:13.018 --> 1:09:14.846
Get home.
Do some homework.

1:09:19.155 --> 1:09:20.982
Two-Knight-117.

1:09:21.635 --> 1:09:23.768
Four minutes out.

1:09:24.812 --> 1:09:25.900
Alvarado.

1:09:25.944 --> 1:09:28.338
Scared the little bastards.

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:32.080
Too old
for this shit.

1:09:33.908 --> 1:09:36.084
All units, all units.

1:09:36.128 --> 1:09:39.131
Robbery in progress
at Beston Bank and Trust.

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:41.438
Three suspects reported,
heavily armed.

1:10:04.896 --> 1:10:06.854
Set?Set.

1:10:06.898 --> 1:10:08.073
Lock and load.

1:10:09.292 --> 1:10:10.597
Here we go, boys.

1:10:14.253 --> 1:10:15.341
Bingo!

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:41.585
Nico, check that out!

1:10:44.675 --> 1:10:47.417
Hey, boy scout,
why don'’t you take care
of our new friend?

1:11:01.387 --> 1:11:02.823
Yeah, I just got
to the location now.

1:11:02.867 --> 1:11:04.303
Everything looks
pretty normal.

1:11:05.696 --> 1:11:07.306
Hey, gentlemen!

1:11:07.350 --> 1:11:09.613
Christ,
I'’m having déjà vu.

1:11:09.656 --> 1:11:11.702
Witnesses said
they saw three guys go
in here.

1:11:11.745 --> 1:11:12.833
One was dressed
as a cop.

1:11:33.245 --> 1:11:34.638
We going in or what?

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:38.555
Oh shit! Take cover!

1:11:43.037 --> 1:11:44.735
Yeah, shots fired.
Shots fired.

1:11:44.778 --> 1:11:46.867
We need cars.
Need your fucking cars
right now!

1:11:46.911 --> 1:11:48.347
Shots fired!

1:12:00.011 --> 1:12:01.578
Hey, get down!

1:12:14.242 --> 1:12:16.506
Officer down!

1:12:17.637 --> 1:12:19.378
Watch, check this out.

1:12:20.292 --> 1:12:21.641
Uh, Knight!

1:13:01.681 --> 1:13:02.943
Keep shooting the roof.

1:13:07.992 --> 1:13:09.297
Keep going.

1:13:14.085 --> 1:13:16.348
Reloading. Cover me!

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:38.805
Where'’s the stun grenade?Cops are at the door.
Let'’s go.

1:13:38.849 --> 1:13:40.416
Shit!
Then hold them back, man!

1:14:09.227 --> 1:14:11.098
Come on, D.
We'’ve got you, mate.

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:12.839
-Help me!
Fucking officer down!

1:14:12.883 --> 1:14:16.277
-Officer down!
-Get him out!

1:14:46.830 --> 1:14:48.701
I can'’t see dick
in here.

1:15:13.683 --> 1:15:15.423
Shit.

1:15:17.164 --> 1:15:18.601
Where the fuck are they?

1:15:22.953 --> 1:15:24.781
All right,
someone take the roof.

1:15:25.477 --> 1:15:26.652
Move! Let'’s go!

1:15:32.658 --> 1:15:34.747
Get the fuck down!
Down on the ground!

1:15:34.791 --> 1:15:36.575
On the ground.
Don'’t fucking move.

1:15:36.619 --> 1:15:38.055
Check the exit.

1:15:39.404 --> 1:15:40.753
Come on!

1:15:42.233 --> 1:15:44.583
No. Drop the goddamn money!Ally, Ally.
You have to calm down.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:46.759
No, I have to go
in there!You'’re safe. You'll be fine.

1:15:48.892 --> 1:15:49.936
Let'’s go.

1:15:54.332 --> 1:15:56.377
Ah, perfect.
Fucking love it.

1:15:56.421 --> 1:15:57.640
Yes!

1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:12.524
There'’s the fuckers.

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:13.699
Ally. What--

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:15.658
What do you mean?
What about her?

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:17.007
Let'’s go.

1:16:20.010 --> 1:16:21.620
Oh, shit.

1:16:21.664 --> 1:16:23.535
This isn'’t gonna
be good.

1:16:26.407 --> 1:16:29.062
Suspect has stolen
a Jesuit Medical ambulance.

1:16:29.106 --> 1:16:31.151
Heading southbound
on Imperial Highway.

1:16:31.195 --> 1:16:32.718
They have a hostage.

1:16:32.762 --> 1:16:34.764
I repeat,
they have a hostage.

1:16:36.983 --> 1:16:39.203
Ally, it'’s fine.
Just please calm down.

1:16:39.246 --> 1:16:40.465
Please.

1:16:40.508 --> 1:16:42.728
What? No.
What is happening?

1:16:42.772 --> 1:16:44.295
Who are
those two guys?

1:16:44.338 --> 1:16:46.340
Please just calm down.

1:16:55.306 --> 1:16:57.700
Hey, Dezi,
we'’ve got incoming.

1:17:01.268 --> 1:17:03.619
Let'’s head to the hills.
We can lose them
in the canyons.

1:17:03.662 --> 1:17:04.881
Fuck this
fucking ambulance!

1:17:04.924 --> 1:17:06.404
Slowest fucking ambulance--

1:17:06.447 --> 1:17:09.494
Come on, baby. Come on!
Come on, come on!

1:17:38.697 --> 1:17:41.047
Knight,
close the goddamn door!

1:17:52.015 --> 1:17:53.712
Get down
and close the door.

1:17:53.756 --> 1:17:55.453
You could hit Ally
with that aim.

1:17:56.672 --> 1:17:58.891
Where did you learn
to drive?

1:17:58.935 --> 1:18:00.763
You.
Now hold on.

1:18:01.981 --> 1:18:04.767
They'’re right on us, mate!
Do something!

1:18:09.075 --> 1:18:09.989
Christ.

1:18:13.123 --> 1:18:15.212
Fucking kill him,
Dezi. Kill him!

1:18:25.222 --> 1:18:26.702
Whoa!

1:18:35.058 --> 1:18:36.842
Holy shit!

1:18:39.802 --> 1:18:41.455
We'’re coming up
on them now.

1:18:57.733 --> 1:18:59.430
What the fuck?

1:18:59.473 --> 1:19:01.649
Come on, baby.
Come on! Come on!

1:19:01.693 --> 1:19:04.696
-Hey, do you hear that?
-Hear what, you fuck?

1:19:14.619 --> 1:19:17.796
Oh shit! Look, paparazzi!
Paparazzi!

1:19:19.102 --> 1:19:20.973
Paparazzi.
Blue paparazzi.

1:19:21.017 --> 1:19:23.149
We'’re gonna
be famous, Nico. Famous!

1:19:23.193 --> 1:19:26.022
Hey bro,
that ain'’t TMZ.
That ain'’t TMZ, bro.

1:19:30.287 --> 1:19:33.507
Swinging back around.
Going for danger plot.

1:19:33.551 --> 1:19:35.596
And I'’m shooting
the back cab.

1:19:36.554 --> 1:19:39.775
Shoot '’em!
Nico, get the fucking copter
and kill it.

1:19:42.081 --> 1:19:45.084
-I can shoot him.
-Then fucking
shoot him, mate.

1:19:51.525 --> 1:19:53.919
Fuck, this is
some serious GTA shit, bro!

1:19:53.963 --> 1:19:54.964
Whoo!

1:19:55.703 --> 1:19:57.053
Come back around.

1:19:57.096 --> 1:19:58.794
Go back around.
Go back around.

1:20:09.065 --> 1:20:11.371
What did I say
about that door?

1:20:19.727 --> 1:20:21.817
Get '’em, Nico.
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

1:20:21.860 --> 1:20:24.776
Fucking shoot
this fuck!

1:20:33.785 --> 1:20:35.308
Oh, fuck, Nico.
You all right?

1:20:35.352 --> 1:20:37.441
Come here. Nico!

1:20:38.094 --> 1:20:39.573
Shit!

1:20:48.495 --> 1:20:50.019
Keep it steady.

1:20:59.593 --> 1:21:01.421
That little shit
hit the tire.

1:21:02.205 --> 1:21:03.946
Now'’s our chance
while he reloads.

1:21:03.989 --> 1:21:05.338
Keep it steady.

1:21:18.047 --> 1:21:19.091
Shit. Shit.

1:21:19.135 --> 1:21:20.223
Hurry up!

1:21:20.266 --> 1:21:22.355
This tire'’s fading fast.

1:21:22.399 --> 1:21:25.184
I got you.
Now, go get your daughter.

1:21:46.553 --> 1:21:47.903
Dezi! Dezi!

1:21:47.946 --> 1:21:49.600
How'’d that old fuck
get in here?

1:21:49.643 --> 1:21:50.906
Motherfucker.

1:21:56.694 --> 1:21:58.783
Don'’t do it,
old man.

1:22:38.127 --> 1:22:42.783
-Get out of here!

1:23:41.929 --> 1:23:44.280
Yo, yo, you all right?
Holy shit!

1:23:45.977 --> 1:23:47.892
Get back.
He'’s got a gun!

1:23:52.114 --> 1:23:53.289
Stay back!

1:23:53.332 --> 1:23:54.377
Stay back!

1:24:11.568 --> 1:24:14.092
Stay back! Stay back,
you motherfuckers!

1:24:14.136 --> 1:24:15.311
I'’ll kill all of you.

1:24:36.941 --> 1:24:38.377
All right,
cover the field.

1:24:38.421 --> 1:24:40.031
Let'’s go around back.
Quick!

1:25:09.408 --> 1:25:10.583
Dad!

1:25:14.413 --> 1:25:17.242
Dad? Oh,
this keeps getting
fucking better.

1:25:21.942 --> 1:25:24.162
Drop the fucking gun!

1:25:28.862 --> 1:25:31.126
Shoot this fucking asshole.

1:25:40.961 --> 1:25:42.093
Let her go.

1:25:44.965 --> 1:25:46.706
I said, let her go.

1:25:49.187 --> 1:25:51.798
It wasn'’t supposed
to be like this!

1:25:53.887 --> 1:25:57.456
I gave everything I had
to this country.

1:25:58.370 --> 1:26:01.286
I tried playing by the rules,

1:26:01.330 --> 1:26:03.201
and look where
it fucking got me.

1:26:05.421 --> 1:26:06.726
You think that?

1:26:09.033 --> 1:26:12.993
You'’re brainwashed
if you think
I'’m the bad guy.

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:16.345
They don'’t pay me
to judge.

1:26:17.302 --> 1:26:21.001
No. You'’re just a sicario
with a badge.

1:26:21.045 --> 1:26:23.526
You shoot anyone
they tell you to.

1:26:23.569 --> 1:26:26.224
The government?
The government--

1:26:26.268 --> 1:26:28.618
The government
is the biggest gang
in town.

1:26:29.488 --> 1:26:31.142
Put the gun down.

1:26:33.927 --> 1:26:36.408
I would'’ve been the best cop
this city has ever had.

1:26:36.452 --> 1:26:39.803
You'’ve got no right
to wear that uniform.

1:26:40.978 --> 1:26:43.415
The badge, it doesn'’t--

1:26:44.155 --> 1:26:45.722
it doesn'’t make the man.

1:26:48.203 --> 1:26:50.770
You don'’t think
I could'’ve been a good cop,

1:26:50.814 --> 1:26:53.295
if I just had
a fucking chance?

1:26:54.209 --> 1:26:57.124
There'’s no cure
for being an asshole.

1:27:01.303 --> 1:27:04.262
All I wanted
was to be the good guy.

1:27:07.613 --> 1:27:08.832
That'’s it.

1:27:10.355 --> 1:27:12.662
We play the cards
we'’re dealt.

1:27:17.623 --> 1:27:21.932
Sometimes we win,
and sometimes we bite it.

1:27:21.975 --> 1:27:23.150
Fuck you.

1:27:53.746 --> 1:27:55.270
Ally!

1:27:56.140 --> 1:27:58.011
I got you.Ally! Please!

1:27:58.621 --> 1:28:01.711
Tell them
I'’m a good guy. Tell them.

1:28:05.584 --> 1:28:07.107
Ally!

1:28:16.203 --> 1:28:17.335
It'’s okay.

1:28:19.468 --> 1:28:21.774
I'’m not gonna shoot.
I'’m the good guy.

1:28:22.732 --> 1:28:24.168
I'’m the good guy.

1:28:24.211 --> 1:28:25.256
I'’m the good--

1:28:29.173 --> 1:28:31.393
Happy Fourth, motherfucker!
