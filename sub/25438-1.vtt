[camera shutter clicks]

00:12.178 --> 00:13.013
You blinked.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.764
I did? I thought that was good.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.224
[women chattering]

00:16.307 --> 00:18.727
[Ruth] Oh, my God, it's like
the first day of school.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.271
-All right, let's take one more.
-[laughing]

00:21.396 --> 00:23.523
-[Ruth] Excuse me.
-Hey, I'm trying to take a picture.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.276
Oh, sure. Yeah, you guys,
Sheila's trying to take a picture.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.444
[Melanie] Photo shoot!

00:27.527 --> 00:29.738
No, I'm just taking
a "first day of work" photo.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.656
-Of course you are.
-I can't fit everyone.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.324
[Jenny] We'll smoosh! We'll smoosh!

00:33.700 --> 00:34.534
[Ruth] Okay.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.454
Maybe if some people could get down
in front or kneel,

00:37.537 --> 00:40.290
we could... You know what?
Here, let's go over to the table.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.043
Come-- Come over here, we'll do levels.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.044
Oh!

00:44.461 --> 00:46.671
-[laughing] Oh, my gosh!
-Where did Sheila go?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.215
-[Tammé] A picture without your queen?
-[Ruth] Well, uh--

00:49.299 --> 00:50.467
-[Rhonda laughs]
-Oh!

00:50.884 --> 00:52.594
-Don't step on me.
-Oh, champion here!

00:52.677 --> 00:55.638
-Hey! Now I can see everyone!
-[Ruth gasps]

00:55.722 --> 00:58.767
-[laughing]
-Sheila, get down! It's just a picture.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.977
No, it's not. It's history.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.146

02:21.057 --> 02:22.517
It's my costume for work.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.019
Imagine I'm Clark Kent,

02:25.228 --> 02:27.939
and I brought in my cape
to be dry-cleaned,

02:28.022 --> 02:29.941
and then you lost it.

02:30.024 --> 02:33.194
And now, whenever I, um,
turn into Superman,

02:33.278 --> 02:35.613
I'm flying around without my fucking cape.

Just-- I'd like to establish, um,
separate accounts, please,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.467
so this never ever happens again.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.263
Okay. And, um,
I'm not paying for his suits.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.724
You're keeping his name?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.225

Hi.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.723
[sighs] Why are you parked
all the way over here?

03:43.806 --> 03:45.767
Well, I-- I'm giving myself a minute

03:45.850 --> 03:49.896
before I have to spend the next 20 weeks
surrounded by people asking me what to do.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.857
Well, you look very clean and pretty.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.901
I like your fancy folder.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.778
It's a portfolio.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.239
So, what's happening today?
Are we doing notes on the pilot?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
I have a bunch of thoughts,
if you want them.

04:01.407 --> 04:05.119
Personally, I think we need main titles.
And punchier graphics, maybe.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.080
Okay, okay, okay. Just-- just...

04:07.163 --> 04:09.874
Just take it easy.
Okay? Let's just take it easy.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.584
-I'm excited!
-Yeah.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.627
Aren't you excited?

04:12.710 --> 04:14.754
Don't pep talk me. All right, Ruth?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.631
The last time I knew what I was gonna do

04:16.714 --> 04:18.841
for 20 consecutive weeks,
I was in college.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.551
And I hated college.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.264
And then, I woke up this morning,
and I ironed this shirt.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.392
What is that?
I-- I feel like someone else.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.019
Well, it's a big job.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.854
But we're in it together.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.231
You'll be Hitch.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.607
I'll be Alma.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.485
Invisible, but indispensable.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.113
What the fuck are you talking about?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.240
Alfred Hitchcock and his wife.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.201
-Oh.
-Alma. You know, the woman behind the man

04:45.285 --> 04:47.287
who is as important as the man

04:47.370 --> 04:51.249
and really helps the man be great
while also getting the job done.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.500
All right.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.211
Well, you've helped me want
to get the fuck out of this car.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.338
Wait.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.174

05:02.885 --> 05:05.013
[in Russian accent]
It's not sentimental present,

05:05.096 --> 05:08.141
is vodka, is classic start gift.

It's nine a.m.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.187
[groaning] Oh, God, I know.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.815

-Um, here you go.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.194
Oh. Britannica. [chuckles]
I feel smart already.

05:20.361 --> 05:24.574
-[both laugh]
-And these. [in gruff voice] Beirut!

05:24.741 --> 05:26.451

05:27.076 --> 05:28.536
I don't want to put this on.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.790
My costume still smells
like beer and racism.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.627
[sniffs] Oh, nobody washed these?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.130
Was I supposed to wash these?

05:39.213 --> 05:42.967
-Hi, hi, hi. Hi. Sorry, I'm late. Hi.
-[Tammé] Hi.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.511
[Debbie chuckles] First day of daycare.
Drama!

05:47.430 --> 05:48.264
[softly] Hey.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.892
Tiny vodka bottle?

05:50.975 --> 05:53.102
Oh, thank you.<i> </i>Uh...

05:55.021 --> 05:56.230
You have a good break?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.442
Yeah, uh... productive.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.404
Sam wants everyone
in full hair and makeup.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.991
-Dawn and Stacey are setting up.
-Okay, cool. Um, cool.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.122
[Tammé] So,
who does Welfare Queen fight first?

06:13.539 --> 06:15.708
She's gotta defend her title, obviously.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.503
[chuckles]
Let's wait for Sam to lay it out.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.672
Hey! Sorry! Where are the costumes?

06:21.839 --> 06:23.424
Finally! Over here.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.677
So you're gonna have to wait till the end
of the day to clean these,

06:26.761 --> 06:28.554
but, you know,
you can just chill over here--

06:28.638 --> 06:30.014
Uh, I'm not cleaning them.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.433
Um... Sorry, who are you?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.520
-Oh, I'm Junkchain.
-[scoffs]

06:36.270 --> 06:37.146
Ah.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.108
Ooh.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.276
-[drill whirring]
-[Sam] All right...

06:42.360 --> 06:44.695
Ladies, exciting stuff.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.864
Huh? Making a show, right?

06:46.948 --> 06:50.743
Feels a little different around here.
And we got a few men in the gym, finally.

06:50.827 --> 06:55.164
Whoo! Hubba-hubba!
Hi, guys! [wolf whistles]

06:55.248 --> 06:57.041
All right, it's adorable,

06:57.125 --> 06:59.710
but don't fucking distract them.
They have work to do.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.628
[softly] Call me.

07:00.711 --> 07:04.382
Okay. Today is a prep day,
which means it's about me.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.927
I'm gonna be checking the shot list,
gonna be adjusting the lighting,

07:08.010 --> 07:10.972
gonna be making sure
I don't hate your costumes on camera...

07:11.055 --> 07:13.975
Oh! "Prep," like "prepare."

07:16.811 --> 07:19.063
Do you maybe want to introduce us
to our new cast member?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.690
Oh, fuck. Yes.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.316
Yolanda.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.486
Meet the girls. Girls, Yolanda.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.489
So, my friends call me Yoyo,
but Yolanda's cool.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.491
[huffs]

07:30.575 --> 07:33.119
Are you replacing anyone else
or just Cherry?

07:33.494 --> 07:35.037
How about you don't worry about it?

07:35.121 --> 07:37.540
Cherry's got a great job,
and she ain't thinking about you.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.668
Does she know
you gave away her character?

07:40.751 --> 07:41.836
To a white girl?

07:42.211 --> 07:43.963
I'm not white. I'm Mexican.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.631
She can play Beirut if she wants.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.426
Look, I decide
who plays who and when, all right?

07:48.509 --> 07:51.137
And I've decided
I like the character Junkchain,

07:51.220 --> 07:53.473
and I want her to be played by a hot girl.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.683
All right? If isn't broke, don't fix it.

07:55.933 --> 08:00.771
So, since Yolanda's new, maybe you want
to walk her through the show's format.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.816
Ruth, it's not rocket science. Okay?

08:03.941 --> 08:05.109
Same thing every week.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.279
Bunch of promos where you guys talk shit
about each other.

08:08.362 --> 08:12.492
All right? Then a wrestling match
and then wrestling match,

08:13.034 --> 08:13.910
wrestling match,

08:14.535 --> 08:15.828
another wrestling match.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.041
Then a title match and then a closer,

08:20.333 --> 08:24.462
where Liberty Belle vows
to take the crown back from Welfare Queen.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.131
Every week?
What about the other story lines?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.675
Know what's better than me
standing up here answering questions?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.720
It's you quietly reading the answers

08:32.803 --> 08:34.472
in your new contracts.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.015
-Contracts!
-Huh?

08:36.098 --> 08:37.767
-Get your contracts here!
-Huh?

08:37.850 --> 08:40.269
[grunting]

08:43.689 --> 08:47.443
"...to own
in perpetuity all of the rights, results,

08:47.568 --> 08:50.696
products, and proceeds in and to

08:50.780 --> 08:54.325
or derived
from wrestler services hereunder."

08:54.450 --> 08:56.577
-Why don't they just write, "We own you"?
-Yeah.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.622
My brother's first wrestling contract was
written on a napkin.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.623
This is a step up.

09:01.123 --> 09:01.999
Anyone got a pen?

09:02.792 --> 09:03.626
Here.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.136
Here, Stacey.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.432
Okay, you're done.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.852
Are you sure?
You don't wanna see anything else?

09:22.895 --> 09:24.272
No, I'm good.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.982
Okay. [chuckles softly]

09:28.401 --> 09:31.404
[sighs] You ever work
around this many fucking women?

09:31.487 --> 09:32.405
Actually, yeah.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.074
I used to shoot porn for Hal Freeman.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.450
I love Hal Freeman.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.119
He's a creep.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.705
But, hey, man, if you need
an artfully framed crotch shot,

09:40.788 --> 09:41.622
I'm your guy.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.165
Hi! Hi.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.294
-So, I don't mean to be alarmist,
-[Sam sighs]

09:46.377 --> 09:49.130
but I think there's still a lot
of confusion about Cherry.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.132
Also, some of the language
in these contracts--

09:51.215 --> 09:55.595
Look, tell the girls, if they don't have
other job offers, to sign 'em.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.096
Of course.

09:57.346 --> 10:01.017
But maybe, since you didn't really answer
any questions during the meeting,

10:01.100 --> 10:05.187
you could set aside some time today
to address the collective anxieties?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.273
Make people feel seen and heard.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.275
No, I don't want people
to feel seen and heard.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.860
I want them to be invisible

10:10.943 --> 10:14.238
so I can transform this gym
into a fake luxury hotel.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.907
All right?
So if you want to be Alma Hitchcock,

10:16.991 --> 10:19.243
go make everyone feel special
so I don't have to.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.917
All right. Who's next?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.961
I'm so glad I got in full hair and makeup

10:29.045 --> 10:31.547
so Sam could point a camera at me
for 25 seconds.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.007
-[Rhonda laughs]
-[Yolanda sighs]

10:33.174 --> 10:34.800
Yes. Mm.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.640
[sighs]

10:48.773 --> 10:49.940
What do you guys think?

10:50.066 --> 10:52.777
Do I need different underwear
or just a different ass? [chuckles]

10:53.778 --> 10:55.655
That costume was perfect on Cherry

10:55.738 --> 10:58.199
because I made it specifically
for her measurements.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.661
So, how'd Sam find you?
Was it an audition or...

11:01.952 --> 11:03.621
more of a personal connection?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.540
Look, your director came to my club.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.959
I gave him a lap dance,
and he offered me a job.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.420
Of course. First open slot,
he just hires a stripper.

11:11.921 --> 11:12.797
Can you rap?

11:14.632 --> 11:15.591
Can you?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.053
Uh, Britannica's a genius.
Junkchain is a rapper.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.931
Oh, really? I thought she was
a sexy sanitation worker.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.724
And what the fuck is that supposed
to mean?

11:23.808 --> 11:25.476
Hey, hey, guys.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.103
Yolanda's not the enemy.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.897
Granted, it feels a little
like she's taking something

11:29.980 --> 11:31.691
that doesn't belong to her.
Not your fault.

11:32.233 --> 11:37.071
But I have an idea
that's gonna make everyone feel better.

11:56.298 --> 11:59.677
No.
We are gonna shoot a main title sequence.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.220
Oh, my God! I love main titles!

12:01.303 --> 12:03.973
Imagine our faces
with our names underneath.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.891
[Stacey] How does the <i>Cheers </i>one go again?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.143
Oh, I've never seen <i>Cheers.</i>

12:07.226 --> 12:09.729
It's great.
It's about an invisible woman named Vera.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.398
We really do need a theme song.
It's got to be memorable.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.357
We're doing it.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.985
You guys,
Sam's not making a title sequence.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.821
Actually, he handed me the reigns
for the rest of the day

12:18.904 --> 12:20.322
while he's working on the set, so...

12:21.615 --> 12:24.368
Why not make something that reminds us

12:24.452 --> 12:28.205
-we are the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.797
Right. Well,
seems like you have it all figured out.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.092
Good luck, uh,
because I have to go to the mall.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.844
I have to buy more shimmer tights.

12:42.887 --> 12:43.846
I love the mall.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.932
-[all grunting]
-[Ruth] Looks great.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.434

12:53.105 --> 12:55.733
But stay in your own... space.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.569
[Ruth] Good, and just--
and just exit camera left.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.656
-[Ruth] Exit left, exit camera left.
-[both exclaim]

13:02.740 --> 13:03.783
[laughs] Yes!

13:04.074 --> 13:06.827
Great, great, great.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.498
[gasps, mouthing]

13:11.791 --> 13:14.710
Okay. Going to get a diet wrap
at the food court.

13:16.837 --> 13:17.797
Great, and cut!

13:19.173 --> 13:21.842
All right. Um... so, next shot.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.594
I want to get Welfare Queen

13:23.677 --> 13:26.639
coming down the escalator towards us.
She's dripping with shopping bags.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.767
Get Liberty Belle going up the escalator,
and when they pass each other,

13:29.850 --> 13:32.728
they start yelling, threatening,
maybe someone takes a swipe or...

13:32.812 --> 13:33.646
Tammé!

13:33.729 --> 13:35.606
Where you going? You're in the next shot!

13:35.689 --> 13:38.400
There's a sale at Robinson's!
I'll be back.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.614
You want me to ride
on the escalator with them?

13:43.697 --> 13:46.617
Get it going both ways,
maybe French overs on the move?

13:47.201 --> 13:48.327
I don't know what that is,

13:48.410 --> 13:51.121
but if it's good enough for the French,
it's good enough for me.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.792
Are you--
Are you sure Sam's cool with this?

13:55.793 --> 13:56.710
Look... [chuckles]

13:57.336 --> 13:59.004
-Russell. Russell.
-Russell.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.800
I know it's your first day, but Sam and I,
we have an understanding.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.885
-[drill whirring]
-[hammers pounding]

14:07.513 --> 14:10.850
All right, hey, be careful with this,
all right? It's a real thing.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.767
[man] Yup.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.940
-[man 2] Using those sandbags?
-[man 3] Yeah, how many do you need?

14:18.023 --> 14:18.858
[man 2] Four.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.278
Thanks, Flor. You saved me.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.322
Yeah. Didn't want you to be embarrassed
on your first day of work.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.784
-It's misleading, right? "Prep day"?
-[Florian] I would have thought the same.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.870
-[Glen] It's right in here.
-Oh!

14:30.953 --> 14:32.955
You look like a real Hollywood producer.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.999
Wow! Looks just like the Hayworth.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.084
I gotta work. [clears throat]

14:37.459 --> 14:39.545
-It-- it does, doesn't it?
-[Sam] Well, it's a cheat.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.047
-But matching's for pussies, right?
-[Bash] Ha!

14:42.590 --> 14:45.759
I know you're busy prepping.
I just wanted to introduce you

14:45.843 --> 14:50.055
to one of our MVP directors
at the network, Rick Hollander.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.392
Uh, yeah, Rick directs
K-DTV's longest-running show,

14:53.475 --> 14:56.186
<i>Quilting Bee Easy. </i>Two E's.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.440
Glen always likes me to swing by
and welcome the new kids to the block.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.402
Ah! Well, I've been around all the blocks.
I appreciate the concern.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.112
Uh, curiosity, not concern.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.073
-So, when do you start shooting?
-Tomorrow.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.159
[drill continues whirring]

15:11.160 --> 15:12.578
Sure it will all come together.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.124
[Glen]
All right, let's take a little look-see.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.211
Put that on, protect your head. [laughs]
All right.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.757
What the fuck?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.384
You don't bring another director
to my set uninvited.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.220
Yeah, and where the hell is <i>my </i>hard hat?
God!

15:30.554 --> 15:33.891
Can you imagine if I'd replaced you
with that guy? Dodged a bullet there.

15:33.974 --> 15:37.686
Wait, Glen "Clit Dick" tried to replace me
with a guy who wears a turtleneck?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.146
Yeah, he kept calling during the break,

15:39.229 --> 15:41.690
'cause you've "never directed
this many hours of television."

15:41.899 --> 15:43.984
Tell you one thing
Rick Hollander doesn't have:

15:44.109 --> 15:45.361
that awesome Trapper Keeper.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.988
-It's a fucking leather portfolio.
-Oh.

I shouldn't call,

21:50.976 --> 21:51.893
Reminded me of...

21:52.519 --> 21:54.688
when we used to be
in scene study class just...

21:54.938 --> 21:57.065
mind-melding over ideas. [chuckles softly]

21:57.524 --> 22:00.652
I mean,
I know the mall's not Chekhov, but...

22:02.237 --> 22:06.408
but I really missed acting with you.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.121
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.207
I'm getting a divorce.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.001

22:43.320 --> 22:46.073

22:46.156 --> 22:47.199
They're open!

22:47.491 --> 22:48.533
And I'm almost done!

22:50.327 --> 22:52.287
What's a "Shitpope"?

22:52.371 --> 22:53.205
What?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.541
[music stops]

22:56.625 --> 22:57.834
What is all this?

22:58.835 --> 23:01.338
It's for Billy's band.
I'm in charge of merch.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.382
All right, you know...

23:04.549 --> 23:07.010
We've gotta talk
about what the hell is going on here.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.221
I'll clean up.

23:09.304 --> 23:12.349
[stammers] No. Not the shirts. You.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.644
Are you going back to Sacramento?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.397
You said I could stay here.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.817
"Stay" implies a short period of time.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.445
You said we were gonna sit down
and have a conversation

23:25.529 --> 23:29.324
about how we were gonna deal
with all this "dad shit."

23:29.741 --> 23:31.993
And then you gave me
some old photo albums to look at,

23:32.077 --> 23:33.328
and we never did.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.497
I don't know who any of those people are.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.583
[stammers]
They're your Sicilian relatives.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.419
Well,
then why don't you tell me their names?

23:40.502 --> 23:43.171
-Or maybe some details?
-Okay, so...

23:44.423 --> 23:45.257
What?

23:45.799 --> 23:47.717
[stammers] You want to talk about this
right now?

23:49.886 --> 23:50.720
Do you?

23:52.389 --> 23:53.723
[sighs]

23:54.558 --> 23:55.392

23:57.018 --> 23:57.853

24:18.999 --> 24:22.252
Small, but I finally get to hang up

Hi! Glen, I'm so sorry I'm late.

-[Debbie] I came from work.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.090
I'm a mess!

24:27.382 --> 24:31.136
-Hi! You must be Jodi.
-Hi! [laughs]

24:31.219 --> 24:32.721
So, uh, once we order,

24:32.804 --> 24:35.974
I promise I will tell you
everything I know about Jack Wagner.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.727
I love him. [laughs] That chin.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.480
[chuckles]
Hi, Mark. William Morris Business Affairs.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.606
Nice to meet you.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.774
So, business before dinner?

24:45.275 --> 24:46.735
Ah, you brought your agent?

24:46.818 --> 24:49.821
Oh, God, he's not my agent.
But I guess he does work for me.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.865
From where I sit,
it's pretty straightforward.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.408
You've made a contract

24:53.492 --> 24:56.578
with a bunch of desperate actresses
who don't know any better.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.372
But, uh, Debbie's clearly worth
more than that.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.836
Um...
I'm proud to be part of the K-DTV family,

25:04.920 --> 25:08.006
just provided we work out these--
I mean, they're tiny details.

25:09.132 --> 25:13.428
Wow, this is a lot of tiny details. Uh...

25:13.553 --> 25:15.847
-[chuckles]
-Oh, Jodi-- Jodi doesn't need one.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.601
No, I'm sure you don't expect your wife
to sit here looking pretty

25:19.684 --> 25:21.978
while we do business.
She might have some great ideas.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.855
Hmm.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.525
[Debbie] You have to understand,

25:26.608 --> 25:30.362
I've been working as an actress
on a nationally syndicated soap opera.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.613
I have a quote.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.657
And I had a career before the show.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.076
I... Uh...

25:36.451 --> 25:37.285
Debbie...

25:38.495 --> 25:41.748
-K-DTV is a small, local network.
-Yeah.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.459
We don't have this kind of money
to throw around.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.712

I don't like when you're
in a clump, whispering.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.160
Spread out so I can see you.

-Nah.
-Glen! So many visits!

26:29.588 --> 26:31.339
[Glen] I just came
to collect the contracts,

26:31.423 --> 26:33.133
make sure you actually had a set
to shoot on.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.885
Looked a little dicey yesterday.
[chuckles]

26:35.969 --> 26:38.054
[laughs] Glen.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.891
Ah, you know what? This can wait.
We can do this later.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.311
No, don't do anything different
because I'm here.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.271

Because I didn't send anyone

28:26.788 --> 28:29.374
to shoot a fucking title sequence
at a mall.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.503

You asked for my help.

I need you to be a fucking actress.

Everybody should hear this.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.283
You're not a director

29:03.366 --> 29:05.785
just 'cause you take a fucking camera
to the mall.

The girls needed a boost.
And if we're being honest,

29:09.122 --> 29:11.458
I thought the show needed something
to pull the audience in.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.419
Well, I'm not pulling them in
with this cheesy, girly bullshit.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.962

on something I didn't direct.
