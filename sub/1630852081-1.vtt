00:11.553 --> 00:15.306
<i>'Twas a time close to Christmas</i>
<i>And through strands of twinkle lights</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.643
<i>Furnaces were cranked up</i>
<i>To 2,000 Fahrenheits</i>

00:19.227 --> 00:21.771
<i>Stockings had been hung</i>
<i>In the hot shop with care</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.941
<i>In hopes that glassblowers</i>
<i>Soon would be there</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
Ho ho ho!

00:27.110 --> 00:29.738
<i>Then Santa called out</i>
<i>From up and above</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:32.741
<i>To artists we all know and do love</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:33.908
This is it.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.869
I want to win so badly.

00:35.952 --> 00:39.664
<i>On, Andi, on, Cat,</i>
<i>Edgar, Nao, and Alexander!</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.542
<i>There is no time for you to meander</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:43.877
Best feeling ever.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.130
<i> For a chance to rewrite</i>
<i>Your own glass story</i>

00:47.213 --> 00:48.214
Sick!

00:48.298 --> 00:51.342
<i>This Christmas</i>
<i>You'll blow for all the glory</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:52.886
Go big or go home.

00:53.386 --> 00:57.724
I'm Bobby Berk, and you are about to be
slayed by <i>Blown Away: Christmas</i>.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.946
Walking back into
this hot shop as a competitor,

01:12.030 --> 01:13.198
I'm totally excited.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.742
It's, like, familiar and new
at the same time.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.368
It makes me emotional.

01:18.328 --> 01:23.333
I'm Edgar Valentine. I was on season one.
I went out on the third challenge,

01:23.416 --> 01:25.335
and I'm back now.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.795
What's up, Al?

01:27.378 --> 01:30.381
I'm Andi. I have unfinished business here.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.592
I am ready to just come and crush it.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.386
I'm gonna make stuff,
break stuff, have fun.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.679
Hey!

01:38.223 --> 01:40.934
I'm Cat, and I got second place
in season two,

01:41.017 --> 01:43.478
but I am back to kick more glass.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.855
-Yeah!
-Hi, guys!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.607
-She's back!

01:49.526 --> 01:50.568
Nao!

01:50.652 --> 01:52.112
Yay!

01:52.195 --> 01:54.906
In this competition,
I'm gonna push myself a little harder,

01:54.989 --> 01:56.491
and I will win.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.204
I think we're all top dog, honestly.
That's why we're here.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.581
-Glassblowers!

02:03.665 --> 02:07.127
-Hey! Welcome to the holiday hot shop.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.086
Yes!

02:08.169 --> 02:09.087
Yeah!

02:09.671 --> 02:12.715
I'm your holiday hot shop host,
Bobby Berk.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.008
Yeah, Bobby!

02:14.551 --> 02:18.429
You guys might know me from
a little show I like to call <i>Queer Eye</i>.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.432
Bobby Berk's design aesthetic
is like…

02:21.516 --> 02:23.601
Like, chef kisses to Bobby Berk.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.813
Don't let this face fool you.
I'm just as tough as she is.

02:27.939 --> 02:33.361
Glass guru and <i>the</i> resident
<i>Blown Away</i> evaluator, Katherine Gray.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.617
Welcome back, glass blowers,
and happy holidays.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.035
Happy holidays!

02:41.119 --> 02:43.538
'Tis the season
for redemption.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.333
Over the past two seasons,

02:47.417 --> 02:51.796
you guys have created exceptional art
right here in this very hot shop,

02:51.880 --> 02:56.676
but sadly, each and every one of you left
without the title of "Best in Glass."

02:59.387 --> 03:00.513
Thanks for the reminder.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.766
Consider this second chance
our Christmas gift to you.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.268
Thank you.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.521
-I didn't get you anything. Sorry.

03:08.605 --> 03:12.066
All right, so sorry to be a Scrooge,
but let's get down to the competition.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.321
At the end of four challenges,
the last glassblower standing

03:16.404 --> 03:18.781
will receive a grand prize

03:18.865 --> 03:22.327
that truly reflects the spirit
of Christmas and the gift of giving.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.079
We asked you each to pick
a charity close to your heart.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.708
Because this season, the winner's charity
will receive a donation

03:28.791 --> 03:32.503
in the amount of $10,000.

03:32.587 --> 03:33.463
-Wow.
-Whoa.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.757
That's only half the story.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.762
The winning artist will also
walk away with $10,000 in cash.

03:40.845 --> 03:41.804
-What?
-Nice!

03:42.555 --> 03:44.891
This is awesome. I wasn't expecting this.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.518
Money is great, I know,
but let's face it.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.188
You all came back
for one thing and one thing only.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.567
The chance to become
a<i> Blown Away</i> champion.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.153
I want that.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.947
All right, let's get to it.

03:59.030 --> 04:03.117
Your first challenge is
a combination of past and presents.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.245
-Presents! Not present.

04:05.328 --> 04:09.582
We want you all to recreate
the best holiday gift you ever received.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.877
We want to see something
that really encapsulates a memory

04:12.961 --> 04:14.295
but is also memorable.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.422
Katherine and I
are gonna be judging

04:16.506 --> 04:19.509
on design, creativity and technical skill.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.095
You've all been given
a spot in this competition,

04:22.178 --> 04:24.013
so now it's up to you to keep it.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.765
There is no do-overs.

04:25.848 --> 04:26.933
This is it.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.894
We're going Christmas balls to the wall.

04:31.062 --> 04:35.733
All right, guys. There's four hours
on the clock, and your time starts now.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.703
The challenge is
you got to make your favorite gift,

04:46.786 --> 04:48.788
the best gift you've ever received.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.793
Growing up,
we didn't get big, fancy presents.

04:53.876 --> 04:58.381
We got a new toothbrush or the hair ties
you had been begging for, for a month.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.008
Like, you got necessities.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.970
But my great-grandmother
started giving me nutcrackers,

05:04.053 --> 05:06.556
and the tradition kind of just kept going.

05:06.639 --> 05:11.269
It might not seem crazy or big, but to me,
it's really important every year.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.770
Ho ho ho!

05:17.066 --> 05:19.277
I was kind of a nerdy kid. Shocker.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.239
I never went to space camp, but I ended up
with a telescope from my grandfather,

05:23.323 --> 05:27.160
and he would help me look through it
and see different planets.

05:27.243 --> 05:32.206
So, I'm going to try to make
a scale model of the solar system.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.002
Hopefully the planets
will align on this piece.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.215
You know, I moved away
from my home country,

05:41.299 --> 05:44.302
so I don't really spend
a lot of holidays with my family.

05:44.385 --> 05:48.389
But last Christmas,
my friend invited me for brunch.

05:48.473 --> 05:53.644
So I got a waffle, whipped cream
and strawberry and blueberry,

05:53.728 --> 05:55.521
and mimosa, of course.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.233
Who doesn't love mimosa?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.820
I grew up Jewish, so,

06:02.904 --> 06:06.324
my Christmases were always spent
with my best friend and her family,

06:06.407 --> 06:09.035
and they would
invite me over Christmas Eve.

06:09.118 --> 06:14.374
And every year, they would give me a box
of exquisite, beautifully crafted candies.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.919
So it'll be kind of this big candy pile.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.714
It's a kind of a nod to just
the magic of being a kid.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.720
Today, I'm making
a Japanese skill toy called a kendama.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.764
It's a little wooden toy, cup and ball.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.101
I got my first kendama
for Christmas when I was 12.

06:33.184 --> 06:37.355
You know, I'm 25, and I'm still getting
as excited when I open one for Christmas.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.033
Okay, let's blow glass.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.036
Welcome back to the hot shop!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.877
I'm super excited to be back here.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.754
I'm, like, just fired up.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.306
I love Christmas,

07:12.390 --> 07:16.686
but Christmas plus hot shop
is, like, extra exciting.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.111
What present from your past
is the most memorable?

07:25.194 --> 07:29.949
I mean, my favorite Christmas present
every year was always building blocks.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.995
-But square's hard, yeah?
-Square can be hard, for sure.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.581
How do you do square stuff?
That mallet thingy?

07:36.664 --> 07:39.625
And you bang it and then
flatten it and stuff like that?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.377
-Exactly.
-All the technical terms!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.588
-Exactly--
-That's why I'm here.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.590
Why am I here?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.216
Because I deserve to be here.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.759
The redemption.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.513
There's that laugh I missed.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.947
Get the… This end.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.367
It must be so hot.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.620
The torch is nothing
compared to the glory hole.

08:17.079 --> 08:21.542
The heat from the glory hole
burns our skin slowly but surely.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.837
How hot is the glass?

08:24.921 --> 08:28.674
The glass coming out
of the furnace is about 2,100 degrees.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.718
So you shouldn't just…

08:31.511 --> 08:32.470
-Not recommended.
-No.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.598
Good. You're working up a sweat.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.225
I appreciate it.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.857
Beautiful. Yep.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.942


08:46.025 --> 08:48.611
This probably
actually won't shock you,

08:48.694 --> 08:50.571
but I've never blown glass before.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.574
How many days do I need
to practice to be as good as you?

08:55.159 --> 08:56.410
-You said days?
-Mm-hm.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.583
Come on!

09:03.167 --> 09:05.169
All right, you're good.
Let's do this.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.837
-Okay.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.007
Winning this first challenge
would be so amazing.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.302
It's gonna make it kind of
look like candy cane, twisted.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.555
I didn't win any challenges my season.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.806
I really want this one.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.894
Two hours remaining.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.939
Oh no.
Time is my enemy on this one.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.899
It's freaking me out, man!

09:28.985 --> 09:30.570
Does look like a waffle, huh?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.076
The most important components
for me is a waffle

09:37.159 --> 09:38.703
with maple syrup on top.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.663
Maple syrup!

09:40.746 --> 09:45.960
Like, those are also the things that
I wasn't allowed to have when I was a kid.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.169
Bah, humbug!

09:48.838 --> 09:50.464
-It looks great.
-Yeah.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.924
I think it's pretty good.

09:53.968 --> 09:58.055
We're gonna start off
with his little face for all the details.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.601
Nutcrackers have tons of tiny detail.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.854
That did what it was supposed to.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.025
So I'm pulling all these
tiny, thin pieces of cane

10:09.108 --> 10:12.612
so I can basically draw
on this nutcracker's face.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.781
Hey, look at his little google eyes!

10:25.625 --> 10:31.339
I'm gonna try to get nine planets,
including the sun, in four hours.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.923
When I came up with this idea,

10:33.007 --> 10:36.761
I knew it was gonna be close to impossible
to make all those components,

10:36.844 --> 10:41.057
but I could also hear in my head
the voices of the evaluators, like,

10:41.140 --> 10:45.478
"Why is there just three planets? Isn't it
supposed to be a whole solar system?"

10:46.228 --> 10:48.356
I am always amazed by Alexander,

10:48.439 --> 10:51.442
who is one of the legends from season one.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.819
His skill level is a lot higher than me.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.863
My ears are burning.

10:55.946 --> 11:01.202
Alexander is
a super-technical glassblower.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.663
We got Mars over here. It's very--

11:03.746 --> 11:05.373
It takes a lot of concentration.

11:06.165 --> 11:12.046
I'm a secular Jewish person
showing up for a Christmas challenge,

11:12.129 --> 11:16.634
kind of looking at this tradition with
some kind of curiosity, and I love it.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.011
All right, there you go.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.222
Okay, so yeah, it's just four more.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.059
And stop.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.941
Guys, one hour left!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.443
Alex, you got 30 minutes!

11:34.527 --> 11:35.861
Is that real?

11:36.904 --> 11:39.782
I'm not necessarily scared
of anything,

11:39.865 --> 11:41.158
besides Alex.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.290
If I go home first, I'll… cry.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.546
Katherine, do you think
playing for charity

11:53.629 --> 11:55.881
is putting a little
extra pressure on them?

11:55.965 --> 11:58.426
Oh my gosh,
it would for me, that's for sure.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.096
Recently, my castmate Karamo and I
did a game show in which

12:02.179 --> 12:03.472
we were playing for charity.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.392
I felt a lot of pressure,
'cause I'm like, "If we don't win,

12:06.475 --> 12:09.770
I have to donate this money myself
because they're counting on us."

12:09.854 --> 12:13.232
Right! I'm sure
that's how the glassblowers feel.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.736
-This color is…

12:17.486 --> 12:21.198
The charity I'm competing for
is the Pixie Project,

12:21.282 --> 12:24.660
an animal rescue
and adoption center in Portland.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.164
I really prefer
the company of dogs to humans,

12:28.247 --> 12:30.750
so I wanted to do
something for the animals.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.337
It's all really going according to plan.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.465
That's perfect. Yep. Good.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.343
So I just want to make sure
this is nice and round.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.765
The charity that I'm competing for
is Water Street Glassworks.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.434
It's a youth program.
It's out in Michigan.

12:48.517 --> 12:52.646
They bring kids in after school, and
they experience glass for the first time.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.734
I wanted to spark these kids' interest
just like the way it sparked mine.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.741
So, I'm doing the ball part
right now.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.743
I'm using the torch, the hot torch,

13:05.826 --> 13:07.620
and then some white cane.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.704
I'm heating it up.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.792
I lightly draw,
as I'm heating it, onto the ball.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.170
If I win, that'd be really cool.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.881
And it's always a great feeling to win.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.217
Nice. Nice.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.891
There is this fold in glass design

13:28.974 --> 13:31.519
that's sometimes referred to
as a "Saturn ring."

13:31.602 --> 13:34.063
I figure if I'm going to make Saturn,

13:34.146 --> 13:37.858
the only way to do it
is to make that kind of detail.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.655
It takes a little bit of precision
to get it right.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.532
There we go.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.909
The charity I'm playing for
is Savage Sisters,

13:46.992 --> 13:48.953
which is a really cool name.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.623
They run recovery houses in Philadelphia,

13:52.706 --> 13:56.752
and they do outreach for people
that are struggling with addiction.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.464
It's a community that I'm a part of, and
it's a community that's helped me a lot.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.217
I mean, I'm in recovery myself.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.762
I got sober in Philadelphia.

14:08.013 --> 14:13.143
It would feel really good to be able to
give back to them in a meaningful way.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.150


14:27.074 --> 14:31.328
Yeah, I'm doing good for time.
It's just, I've got a lot I want to do.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.665
-Whoop!

14:39.503 --> 14:41.922
-Edgar Valentine.
-Hi, Katherine.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.133
-Nice to see you.
-Great to see you.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.052
So, what feels different for you
about being back this time?

14:47.136 --> 14:51.348
I've changed a lot as a person and
as an artist within the last three years.

14:51.432 --> 14:55.185
I've studied with a handful of people
traveling around the US.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.520
-Yeah.
-A lot has changed.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.898
I'm looking forward
to seeing what you produce.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.608
-Thanks. Appreciate it.
-Take care.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.068
I came back because
I got something to prove.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.320
All right,  grab it.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.781
My biggest competition
is just 22-year-old Edgar.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.286
I know, I'm blowing it.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.288
-Hi, Andi. How you doing?
-Hi!

15:14.371 --> 15:16.832
-I'm doing well. How are you today?
-Good.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.252
I was thinking I'm gonna be comfortable
this time, and then you come in,

15:20.336 --> 15:21.754
and it's like… bah!

15:23.088 --> 15:26.508
-Tell me what you're making.
-I am making candy.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.095
And I want it to look really delicious
and yummy, like you want to eat it.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.306
-Yeah.
-But exaggerated.

15:32.389 --> 15:36.018
And gone chaotic into knots and tangles.

15:36.518 --> 15:40.606
As a glassblower,
I would describe my style as punk-luxe.

15:40.689 --> 15:44.401
So it's luxury with kind of
a tongue-in-cheek kind of attitude,

15:44.485 --> 15:46.487
it's playful and clever.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.031
Hard candy,
a lot of those processes

15:49.114 --> 15:52.117
-are similar to things we do in glass.
-Totally.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.037
-Good luck.
-Thank you for your time.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.164
Nice catch.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.710
-How's it going?
-Good. How's it going?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.003
Pretty good.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.632
Whenever you're ready.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.762
Yep.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.725
-So nice.
-Yeah.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.316
All right, everybody,
20 minutes left in the challenge.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.317
Twenty minutes.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.695
Holy…

16:29.780 --> 16:31.031
All right, big man.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.785
I've never made a stocking before.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.704
I'm feeling the glassblowing now.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.999
I haven't made anything this big

16:40.082 --> 16:42.418
since the last time
I was in this hot shop.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.212
Flip.

16:47.256 --> 16:51.593
The physical toll
of moving that much glass,

16:51.677 --> 16:55.806
you feel it in every single
muscle in your body.

16:56.807 --> 17:01.478
Like, every piece of you
is having to support that much weight,

17:01.562 --> 17:03.772
and it takes it out of you.

17:10.112 --> 17:10.946
Flip.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.659
Okay.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.620
Now I've got all my candy pieces
in the annealer,

17:18.704 --> 17:20.289
so I need to start on the base.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.333
Okay, the magic is about to happen.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.671
The technique I'm using
is called post-gathering.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.258
You get your bubble set up,
and you gather hot glass on top of it.

17:31.341 --> 17:35.763
So then, as you roll, the pieces roll
right back up on the surface.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.722
Yeah!

17:37.431 --> 17:39.767
It is way heavier
than I thought it was gonna be.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.648
Whoa, that ain't gonna work.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.984
All right, grab it.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.363
I'm gonna torch the end a little bit.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.034
Honestly, it came together
exactly how I wanted to.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.537
I'm definitely really satisfied
with how it all went.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.873
Whoo hoo hoo!

18:02.956 --> 18:04.291
There it is.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.127
Just look over,
and I see that Edgar's gone.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.631
In season one,
that's all they wanted to talk about,

18:10.714 --> 18:12.091
was me finishing first.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.426
Like, I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.806
Five minutes left! Five minutes.

18:18.889 --> 18:19.723


18:20.724 --> 18:24.436
I have to still make whipped cream.
Completely forgot about whipped cream.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.022
One more heat and that's it. Hoo!

18:29.316 --> 18:30.484
Flip.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.028
The time, it gives me anxiety.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.989
There's something
in the back of your mind like,

18:36.073 --> 18:38.367
"If anything goes wrong, I'm done."

18:41.370 --> 18:42.371
Yeah.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.330
Oh my God.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.457
Grab it.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.294
-Running.
-Time is running out!

18:49.378 --> 18:51.171
Get your pieces in the annealer.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.506
Lovely!

18:53.590 --> 18:55.759
Got it? Nice.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.679
-Coming through!
-All right, let's put this away!

18:59.680 --> 19:00.848
Yeah, nice job, dude!

19:01.932 --> 19:02.975
That was insane!

19:15.320 --> 19:20.075
So the challenge is to recreate
a memory of our favorite present

19:20.159 --> 19:22.536
or gift that we've ever gotten.

19:22.619 --> 19:26.874
I'm hoping that they get the experience
of when you come down at Christmas

19:26.957 --> 19:29.001
and you see your little toy peeking out.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.255
I hope the evaluators
will experience a little bit

19:33.338 --> 19:36.425
of that sense of wonder
that inspired me to make the piece.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.889
Gifts, to me, is not always
about the material, but also

19:41.972 --> 19:44.057
the moments that touches my heart.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.854
I'm hoping that the evaluators see

19:48.937 --> 19:52.024
how kendama has affected me
and my passion for it.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.944
It means so much to me
that my friend's family

19:56.028 --> 19:58.280
included me in their celebrations.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.490
I really hope the evaluators see

20:00.574 --> 20:02.659
the sweetness of this memory for me.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.750
First Christmas gallery.
What do you think? Santa-approved? Yes?

20:09.833 --> 20:12.628
I'm gonna make a list
of who's naughty and nice.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.505
All right. So this is Nao's piece.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.717
-Can I pick this up? Yeah?
-I think it should be fine, yeah.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.094
-That's a nice, full mimosa.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.304
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

20:22.387 --> 20:23.764
-T-ting!
-T-ting!

20:23.847 --> 20:28.602
"In Japan, Christmas is celebrated
by couples, and Nao always felt left out."

20:28.685 --> 20:32.189
"When she moved to the States and was
invited to a friend's Christmas brunch,

20:32.272 --> 20:33.941
Nao finally felt like she belonged."

20:34.024 --> 20:37.736
I really like it, and I like how bright
and colorful it is. It's very festive,

20:37.819 --> 20:40.280
and it's not ambiguous about what it is.

20:40.364 --> 20:44.952
It's very convincing and really,
kind of, charming and childlike too.

20:45.035 --> 20:49.164
I love the syrup. I think it would have
been better without the large glob there,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.875
but other than that,
I think it's beautiful.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.628
-So, this is Edgar's piece.

20:54.711 --> 20:58.632
"Kendamas have helped him
with hand-eye coordination and patience."

20:58.715 --> 21:02.219
"At 25, Edgar still gets giddy
and excited when he gets one as a gift."

21:02.302 --> 21:03.220
That's adorable.

21:03.303 --> 21:07.182
My first reaction is I'm a little
disappointed in the execution of it.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.645
I kind of agree with you, especially,
you know, where these things join.

21:11.728 --> 21:15.274
It's a little rough,
but I like the playfulness of it.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.526
The snowflake pattern on the ball,

21:17.609 --> 21:20.529
I feel like that could have been
done a little bit more crisply.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.240
I actually like the fact
that the drawing isn't perfect.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.576
It feels like a toy
that was made in Santa's workshop.

21:27.369 --> 21:31.748
Typically, kendamas usually have a string
that attaches the ball to the handle.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.667
I'm not sure why he didn't include that.

21:33.750 --> 21:37.004
Edgar had finished these parts
with enough time to make a string.

21:37.087 --> 21:40.716
So I feel like, you know,
maybe that goes on the naughty list.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.220
So, this is Cat's piece.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.140
I think she did a fabulous job
on that nutcracker.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.683
I love his nose.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.476
He's got this big ol' schnoz.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.520
His face is amazing.

21:53.603 --> 21:57.190
I like how even though 60% of that
nutcracker is down in the stocking,

21:57.274 --> 22:01.570
she still actually finished the whole
nutcracker all the way down to the feet.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.281
I like that she even made
that little fireplace hook thing.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.492
Yeah.
I think I'd be nitpicking just about

22:07.576 --> 22:10.120
being thicker and thinner
on the candy canes.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.955
Katherine Gray nitpicking?

22:13.248 --> 22:14.708
That's what I'm here for.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.795
This is Alexander's piece.
I'm obsessed with this one.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.089
I'm obsessed with space,

22:21.173 --> 22:23.383
so this caught my eye
the moment I walked in.

22:23.967 --> 22:27.596
He's made what's called
an orrery, a model of the universe.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.390
Typically, they move,
so he's opted to not make it kinetic.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.143
I don't blame him.
That would've been challenging.

22:33.226 --> 22:36.313
I mean, he had four hours,
Katherine, four whole hours,

22:36.396 --> 22:38.231
and he couldn't make it move?

22:39.149 --> 22:41.818
The only thing
that sticks out to me is that Saturn

22:41.902 --> 22:43.528
is not at a tilt enough.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.446
Ah!

22:44.529 --> 22:45.739
Burn!

22:45.822 --> 22:49.368
I feel like he maybe took
some shortcuts with the coloration.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.287
Doing these in an opaque matte

22:52.371 --> 22:56.917
would've been a really nice contrast
between the shiny stems and the planets.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.670
This is Andi's.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.964
"Andi's piece celebrates
the sweetness of childhood,

23:03.048 --> 23:04.883
friendship, and lasting memories."

23:04.966 --> 23:06.927
I do really love
the colors that she's used.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.054
I feel they are very reminiscent of candy.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.806
They're bright and poppy.

23:10.889 --> 23:15.352
I like here how it actually has ridges
in it, which I think is very beautiful.

23:15.435 --> 23:18.105
You know, as far as
her overall design concept…

23:19.439 --> 23:21.191
-I get it, but I don't.
-Mm. Mm-hm.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.069
-I'm kind of with you on that.
-But it's very pretty.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.655
Should we bring the glassblowers back in?

23:26.738 --> 23:30.492
All right, let's bring them in, but first,
let's put on our resting Grinch faces

23:30.575 --> 23:32.244
to freak them out a little.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.955
I'll have to practice mine.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.457
Come on, practice makes perfect.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.633
Winning this first challenge,
it would be everything.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.969
Definitely a little nervous.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.596
You know, there's only
five of us this time, so…

23:51.680 --> 23:54.724
If I was gonna go home first,
I would be mad.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.643
I would be spitting mad.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.564
So, you guys, Christmas is
all about making memories,

24:00.647 --> 24:04.901
and you guys did such an amazing job
bringing your wonderful memories to life.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.987
I feel like it was
really educational for me

24:07.070 --> 24:10.115
to see some of the things
that have informed you as artists.

24:10.198 --> 24:13.452
So, Nao, how do you think
that this piece reflects your skill?

24:13.535 --> 24:16.746
I'm not really a sculptor,
but I had it in my head.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.540
I wasn't sure if it's gonna work.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.001
Only the problem was that mimosa.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.879
I wish I had more time
to kind of pull and make it skinnier.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.339
I think you did a great job
on all those techniques,

24:26.423 --> 24:28.967
especially if they're not
typically in your wheelhouse.

24:29.050 --> 24:32.179
-But I'm pretty happy how it came out.
-Thanks, Nao.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.639
Alexander, it's your turn in the hot seat.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.058
Thinking about holiday gifts,

24:37.142 --> 24:39.811
I found myself
thinking about being grateful

24:39.895 --> 24:42.981
to have people in my family
that nurture curiosity.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.317
It's beautifully done.
I love the simplicity.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.443
Thank you.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.028
In regards to the colors,

24:48.111 --> 24:50.822
why did you make Earth
green instead of blue?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.073
It's the blue planet.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.494
I've just thought of looking at
what was on the continents, I wanted to--

24:55.577 --> 24:57.746
Even though the planet's 79% water?

24:59.956 --> 25:03.335
I am kind of curious why
you kept some planets transparent.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.756
I just wanted there to be kind of
a variety in the surfaces in that way.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.883
-Thanks, Alexander.
-Thank you.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.385
What was your goal
with this piece?

25:12.469 --> 25:16.056
Like, I just wanted it to kind of
look like holiday, happy Christmas,

25:16.139 --> 25:18.934
weird glass, bizarre sculpture-y thing,

25:19.017 --> 25:23.230
you know, without necessarily being like,
"Oh, I'm looking at Christmas candy."

25:23.313 --> 25:26.233
The form definitely left us
scratching our head a little bit.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.902
The back story helps,
but we're still trying to figure out

25:28.985 --> 25:30.612
what it was meant to be.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.281
Okay. Thank you. I can see that.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.909
-Thanks, Andi.
-Thank you, appreciate it.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.912
Cat, tell us about your piece.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.081
What I love getting is nutcrackers.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.708
I have this, like,
kind of creepy collection.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.876
How many do you have?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.336
I have over 40 right now.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.214
She's like, "I have them
in a display cabinet in my bedroom."

25:50.382 --> 25:53.093
"No one stays the night.
I don't understand."

25:53.176 --> 25:54.970
-Still single.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.764
The sculpting
and the bit work there.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.642
I mean, I think you did
a really masterful job on it.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.810
Thank you, guys.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.144
Edgar.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.438
I definitely tried
to go through the whole prompt

26:05.522 --> 26:09.359
and make a little checklist of what to do
and what to stay away from.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.360
Just like Santa.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.362
Just like Santa! Yep.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.990
We did kind of wonder
why you didn't include the string.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.283
Not on the checklist?

26:16.366 --> 26:18.618
-Here's the thing with the string.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.663
So I was just gonna cane draw it on,

26:21.746 --> 26:25.375
but I got, like, super distracted,
and honestly, I did forget the string.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.003
-Thank you, Edgar.
-Yeah.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.715
All right, glassblowers. Katherine and I
are gonna go have a little chat now.

26:38.179 --> 26:40.140
I am nervous.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.768
I don't know if I hit the mark,
or I'm completely off the mark.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.771
My palms are
definitely getting sweaty,

26:47.480 --> 26:49.733
but you know, it's all fun and games.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.068
Until you get the boot.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.866
Today, one of you created a piece
that was the perfect combination

26:57.949 --> 27:02.412
of good design, exceptional creativity,
and impressive technique.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.789
Today's "Best in Blow" is…

27:09.085 --> 27:10.253
-Cat.
-Yes!

27:10.337 --> 27:12.005
-Yay!
-Yeah!

27:12.088 --> 27:13.006
Thanks, guys.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.550
I did it!

27:15.634 --> 27:17.469
I won!

27:17.552 --> 27:20.889
Cat, you are one step closer
to the $20,000 grand prize

27:20.972 --> 27:24.476
and the title of
<i>Blown Away: Christmas</i> Champion.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.518
Whoo!

27:27.437 --> 27:30.482
And now for the person
whose piece did not blow us away.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.739
I'm sorry to say that is Andi.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.741
-Boo!

27:39.824 --> 27:43.161
Thank you, guys, so much.
I had so much fun being here.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.414
Time to take your stocking down
from the mantel and leave the hot shop.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.416
-See you guys on the flip side.
-I know.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.043
See ya.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.754
I came back.
I loved the piece I made,

27:52.837 --> 27:56.591
and I really loved
being back in the hot shop.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.468
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.516
Last time,
I left on a piece that I loved,

28:04.599 --> 28:07.185
and this time I'm leaving
on a piece that I love.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.813
That's the best I can do.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.024
To the rest of you, jolly good job.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.152
You've definitely proven that
you all belong back in this hot shop.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.823
But, of course,
there are more reindeer games ahead,

28:19.906 --> 28:22.617
and many more holiday puns too.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.746
So get ready.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.417
We will see you
at the next Christmas challenge.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.459
See you then.
