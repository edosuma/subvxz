I was wondering if you'd made any decision
regarding the assistant manager's position.

07:02.555 --> 07:06.753

it's between Stu and yourself.

Stu Rubin, the new guy?

quite aggressive, and we like that.

not afraid to crunch the numbers

In the meantime, take him through
our loan qualifying procedures,

07:26.079 --> 07:28.513

07:35.956 --> 07:39.119

you could pick me up a turkey club?

08:42.155 --> 08:47.354
No way! Wow. It's a 1929 Standing Liberty,
and it's almost fully struck.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.222
You found this in
regular circulation at the bank?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.387
I did.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.694
I'm gonna add this

Mrs Ganush, the bank is informing you

11:19.412 --> 11:23.644
of their intent to repossess your property
at 325 Brandon Street today.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.810
But this is my home for 30 years.

11:27.754 --> 11:32.020
And I make every payment
until the sickness took my eye.

11:32.859 --> 11:37.159
I hope to have more money soon.
I just need a little more time. You...

11:37.263 --> 11:40.596
I don't think my manager's going
to extend you any more credit.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.862
Please. Won't you try?

11:50.877 --> 11:53.038
-Okay.
-Bless you.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.438
Bless you!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.545
CHRISTINE: We have
an elderly woman asking

12:03.623 --> 12:06.114
for an extension on her mortgage payment.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.718
She's on a fixed income,
and she's had some medical problems.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.788
There's gotta be something
we can do to help her.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.873
MR JACKS: Well, apparently,
we've already granted her two extensions.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.942
And, you know, on this type of foreclosure,
we seize the trapped equity

12:27.046 --> 12:29.480
and the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.777
We would have to
throw her out of her house.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.579
It's a tough decision.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.252
Your call.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.275
I'll take care of it.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.438
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

13:26.539 --> 13:29.303
but another extension on the loan
is out of the question.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.866
-What?
-I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

13:31.978 --> 13:36.381
No, please, this is my home.
Where will I live?

13:37.717 --> 13:40.447
You list your granddaughter as a reference.
Maybe you could stay with her.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.145
I would not burden her.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.318
And there are several fine assisted
living facilities for the elderly...

13:46.392 --> 13:51.227
A nursing home? No, I would
never live in one of those places.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.994
I'm really sorry.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.523
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

14:22.929 --> 14:25.864
and never have I begged for anything.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.265
But now, I beg for you.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.103
-I humble myself before you.
-Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

-Please stand up.
-I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

It's not your fault.

It's not your fault.

23:27.473 --> 23:30.636
And regardless of what you may
or may not have been able to do,

23:30.910 --> 23:33.538
that's still no justification for her...

23:41.820 --> 23:44.050

No. What?

-Clay, I really want to do this.

Can you do that?

25:10.075 --> 25:13.135

Freud said destiny was not an act of fate,

26:05.964 --> 26:07.727

created by our subconscious

understand the world by intellect alone.

-Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.747
Because he wasn't
afraid to bring God into the equation.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.116
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

-Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.486
-Shall we?
-I'm ready.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.252
Very well. Please, give me your hand.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.988
Okay.

And you've recently lost something.

26:55.781 --> 27:01.242
-No, I don't think so.
-No. No, you haven't lost anything.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.686
But something's been taken from you.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.751
No.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.294
-RHAM JAS: A button.
-Oh, my God. Yes!

27:11.196 --> 27:13.027
Well, anyone can see
she's missing a button! So what?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.360
But, Clay, it was really strange.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.866
The old woman today,
she took a button from my sleeve.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.803
-Why would she do that?
-If you would both please just be quiet!

28:48.193 --> 28:49.626
-What do you mean?
-Well, he's...

28:49.728 --> 28:51.593
Did you blaspheme the dead
while visiting a graveyard?

28:51.697 --> 28:53.756
-No!
-Did you play with a Ouija board

28:53.865 --> 28:55.696
or consort with those
who practise the black arts?

28:55.801 --> 28:57.098

Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay. No. No, I didn't.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.133
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

29:08.547 --> 29:12.313
-Then how did he know all that?
-Know what? That you lost a button?

29:13.151 --> 29:14.641
And by the way,
he didn't really know that much.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.653
He makes a couple
of good guesses, then he...

29:16.755 --> 29:19.656
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you
with all these questions

29:19.758 --> 29:22.318

Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

But he didn't want the money.
He tried to give it back, remember?

29:29.101 --> 29:32.832
Well, he sort of tried,
but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

29:35.841 --> 29:37.331

44:38.910 --> 44:41.174
Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.

44:41.245 --> 44:45.238
The Black Goat, only summoned
by gypsies for their darkest deeds.

44:46.050 --> 44:51.511
For the first three days, the Lamia appears
as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.

44:51.589 --> 44:54.524
After that, it reveals
itself to be a taker of souls,

44:54.592 --> 44:57.026
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.

44:57.094 --> 44:58.584
Accursed object. What object?

44:58.696 --> 45:02.097
Something taken from the victim,
cursed and given back.

45:06.103 --> 45:07.400
This?

45:09.574 --> 45:10.768
What if I just burn it?

I'm afraid no matter
what condition the button is in,

45:14.445 --> 45:17.937
you would still be the owner.
The Lamia would still come to take you.

45:18.082 --> 45:19.743
Take me where?

45:26.457 --> 45:30.723
-Then how do I get rid of this?
-You could attempt to appease the spirit.

45:30.795 --> 45:32.729
The simplest way
would be a blood offering.

45:32.797 --> 45:36.733

a chicken perhaps.

No.

We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

-Well, right around the harvest time,

-but I'm not a teller.
-Oh?

54:15.786 --> 54:17.583
CLAY: Yeah, Mom, I told you.
Christine's a loan officer.

54:17.654 --> 54:20.987
She handles all the loans
for small businesses and homes for her bank.

54:21.091 --> 54:24.618
And she's up for this big
promotion, so... Right, Chris?

54:24.728 --> 54:27.891
If I could close this one account that
I'm working on, it would really help.

54:27.965 --> 54:30.058
That must be a very important loan.

54:30.134 --> 54:32.967
It's the biggest that my branch
has ever handled.

54:33.070 --> 54:35.231
And how did that come to you?

54:35.572 --> 54:37.733
Well, I was reading
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

54:37.808 --> 54:40.106
and came across
this medical supply company

54:40.177 --> 54:43.613
that was looking to expand
but didn't have the liquidity.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.581
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

54:46.650 --> 54:49.414
for restructuring
some of their long-term debt.

54:49.486 --> 54:52.080
Sounds like you've got
a lot going for you, Christine.

54:52.156 --> 54:55.023
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

54:55.259 --> 54:56.658
I suppose.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.601
I don't see much of my mother.

55:04.668 --> 55:07.865
-Why is that?
-Wow, Mom, that's... It's kind of personal.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.030
TRUDY: I'm speaking to Christine.

55:13.844 --> 55:18.645
Well, ever since my dad died,
she doesn't talk much.

55:19.116 --> 55:25.487
She just stays on the farm
and keeps to herself because...

55:26.824 --> 55:28.291
Because?

55:28.358 --> 55:32.124
Because her husband died, Mom,
and she just wants to be by herself.

55:32.196 --> 55:35.290
-Why don't...
-Because my mother's an alcoholic.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.024
Oh.

55:39.536 --> 55:41.026
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry.

55:42.072 --> 55:44.802
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

55:45.475 --> 55:48.740
I have to say,
I find your honesty very refreshing.

55:49.646 --> 55:52.979
My father had a drinking problem,
and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

55:54.218 --> 55:56.083

-She was dreadful, Christine.

-They met on the Internet.

-"They met on the Internet"?
-CHRISTINE: Really?

56:10.734 --> 56:12.998

-Am I being too hard on him?

No, not at all.

must put herself at great risk.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.826
-She will not do that for free.
-What do you need from me?

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.401
$10,000 cash

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:13.170
by tomorrow.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.419
-Mr Jacks.
-Yeah?

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:33.359
This is kind of awkward for me,
and I know it's not official yet,

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:38.128
but I was wondering if I could get
an advance for the new position.

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:40.431
What, the assistant manager's position?

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:43.768
Yes. See, one of my family
members is really sick.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.268
-They're not gonna die, but they could.
-Christine. Christine.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:53.008
There's a problem.
The McPherson deal was cancelled last night.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.549
-What?
-Yeah.

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:58.949
Right after I informed the regional office
that we had this big loan pending,

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:02.547
I find out that they just made
their deal over at First National.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.524
Now, I gotta call in to see
what exactly happened,

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:08.564
but right now, this does not
look too good for you or for me.

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:14.399
So, this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.474
In fact, you know, I think, with
everything that's been happening,

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:21.738
I think I'm gonna have
to give this job to Stu.

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:24.409
Stu. I see.

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.144
I'm sorry.
Look, if you've got family problems,

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:31.743
maybe you should take the day off,
sort them out and...

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:56.503

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.114
(SCREAMING)

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.986
-So, how much?
-$3,800 for everything.

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.959
-Including my jewellery?
-Including.

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.929
But this stuff is worth
so much more than that.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.231
Please. This is all I have. I'm begging you.

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:56.401
Take it or leave it.

(CHRISTINE SOBBING)

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.846

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.513
Baby?

01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:33.369
I thought you were lactose intolerant.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.871
I am.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:40.278
But then I thought,
"Screw it, I'm eating ice cream."

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.214
I paid Rham Jas.

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:51.717
What? You're kidding me.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.120
I paid him.

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:58.224
Why? I mean, I thought
that you didn't believe.

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.694
I don't know what I believe in any more.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:05.571
I really don't,
but I know that you believe in this.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.337
I know how important it is to you,

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.812
and I know how much pain
this is causing you.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:16.978
And, I also remembered...

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:20.484
I remembered a promise that I made

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.923
the night I fell in love with you.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.255
I told myself that I would...

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:30.932
I would always look out for you.
I'd always take care of you.

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:34.259
So I paid him.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.273
You remember the night
that you fell in love with me?

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.402
I remember the second
I fell in love with you.

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.514
Oh, my God.

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.859
You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:03.398
He said I should come alone.

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:06.799
Yeah, I know, I know he did.
He told me the same thing.

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.834
Christine, if you will permit me

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:48.137
the pleasure of an introduction,
Shaun San Dena.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:54.074
-Welcome.
-How do you do?

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:57.248
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:00.447
Furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the Lamia.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:05.017
I first encountered this spirit
many years ago in this very house.

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.023
And what happened?

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:14.934
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:24.142
I have waited these long years

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.707
for a chance at redeeming myself,

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.347
a chance to destroy the foul thing.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:35.217
-And...
-MILOS: <i>Tetièko,</i> please.

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:43.388
Tonight, my chance will come.

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:48.230
But to summon it, I will need your help.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:51.367
Can you be strong?

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.408
I'll try.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.746
My late husband, Sandor,
was also medium.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.254
He chose this site to build a house upon

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:10.257
because he sensed
certain forces at work here.

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:14.919
In this place, there is a particular...

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.263
A particular confluence of forces

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:28.536
which allows a doorway to be opened
through which we may pass...

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.881
...and through which others
may pass into our world.

Please be seated.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:19.490
Everything we're doing is for your
own good. Please. Christine, please.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.432
Thank you.

Once the spirit has entered me,
put my hand upon the animal.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.529
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:10.203
I force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat.
Milos, that's when you strike.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.706

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.653
We all must be receptive.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:46.412
-What am I supposed to do?
-You must allow the darkness in.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:50.178
You must invite the dead
to co-mingle with your spirit.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:53.215
-I'm scared.
-Yes.

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:58.887
Now repeat these words,
"I welcome the dead into my soul."

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:06.056
-I welcome the dead into my soul.
-You must believe it!

It is the spirit of some

No! No. I've got it under control.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:59.586
We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...
Wait! Where's my envelope?

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:02.190
-What envelope?
-It was in my purse. I just had it!

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.350
-It's just an envelope.
-No, it's gotta be here!

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:07.361
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.361
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:12.093
I thought I'd lost it. Okay.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.426
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.946
BOY: Dad, can we go to the Angel game?

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:40.087
-What about the Dodgers?
-We're only gonna be in town for a few days.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:46.129
I'm sure if I just tell him
how much I care about you,

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.566
I mean, he's gotta understand.

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.571
WAITRESS: Are you sure
you don't want anything else?

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.632
No.

01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:58.906
WAITRESS: So you're just gonna
sit here drinking coffee all night long.

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:02.246
Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:06.549
Honey, I make my money on tips.
Coffee drinkers don't tip.

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:10.557
Honey, just keep the coffee coming
or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:56.098
Oh, my gosh. What a delightful surprise.

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.769
You're the sweetest person in the world.

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.105
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.181
Just get here in 10 minutes
or I'm gonna tell Mr Jacks

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:08.476
something you don't want me to tell him.

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.882
<i>STU: Oh, yeah? Like what?</i>

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.951
Well, for starters, that you stole
the McPherson loan file off my desk

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:18.390
and gave it to First National.
Now you got nine minutes!

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.560
-Give me another.
-Seriously?

01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:38.676
Oh, God, Christine, please don't tell on me.
I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:42.046
-Just tell me what you want.
-I need to give something to you.

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.243
-A little gift.
-A gift?

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:48.019
But I don't understand.
I thought you called me down here

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:49.990
because I gave that loan to First National...

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:53.220
Look, you don't need to understand.
Just shut up!

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.393
Now, this gift that I'm giving you,
it'll become your property.

01:23:57.499 --> 01:24:00.093
You'll be the owner, all right?

01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:04.235
Okay.

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:10.737

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:15.246
What?

01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:17.743
Forget it.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.248
But I thought you wanted to give it to me
'cause of the loan stuff.

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:22.721
Just leave.

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:28.796
Okay. Thank you so much, Christine.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.232
-But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?
-Go!

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:38.398
Okay.

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.309
Who does deserve this?

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.267
Well? Is it possible?

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:18.570
There are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.773
They give gifts to their departed

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:25.182
to curry favour with the deceased's soul,
for, truly, the soul never dies.

01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:32.016
Yes. I do believe you can give the curse
to someone who has passed on,

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:35.819
<i>but you must make a formal gift</i>
<i>of the accursed object to the deceased</i>.

01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:39.628
I'll do better than that.
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.701
I'm gonna get some...

I'm giving it back to you!

You're gonna take this thing.

01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:38.609
Are you gonna take this thing?

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:42.547
Take it!

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.503
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:09.942
I, Christine Brown,
do hereby make a formal gift of this button

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:12.350
to you, Sylvia Ganush!

01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:16.190

God, I'm so glad you're here.
So many things I wanna tell you.

And there's something else,
something that I couldn't admit to before.

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:17.864
I could have given Mrs Ganush
another extension on her loan, but I didn't.

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:23.562
It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.

That's too bad, because I... Look
what I found. I found this in the car.

I thought...

01:32:55.637 --> 01:32:58.071
And I thought maybe you could...
