There she is.

Ohh. Oh!
She's with Michael Kornbloom.

You should've danced with her.

Is that advice from my brother

from either.

Put a little horseradish on it.
It's fantastic.

Okay. I'll just stick to the roast chicken.
You don't know

You came here for her.

You, David Basch,

13:01.436 --> 13:04.564
Geez, when we were kids,
we would've killed to see that.

13:06.041 --> 13:09.568

Dad'd pack us in the car...

13:09.644 --> 13:12.477
and take us to the Pavilion?

13:12.547 --> 13:15.846
And he'd buy us the hot dogs,
the T-shirts, whatever we wanted...

13:15.917 --> 13:18.613
just as long as the Bruins won.

13:20.956 --> 13:22.947
Dad and his sons.

Well, she might like it.

13:47.015 --> 13:49.779
Naw, it's not the same with a girl.

13:49.851 --> 13:51.842
How about Irene?

13:54.289 --> 13:56.780
Well, we used to go.

13:56.858 --> 13:58.849
We don't go anymore.

14:05.634 --> 14:07.625
In fact,

14:08.703 --> 14:11.001
for the first time in 22 years,

14:13.842 --> 14:16.470
I've been thinking about
having an affair.

14:24.185 --> 14:26.619
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>I don't think he meant it. Hejust was upset.</i>

14:26.688 --> 14:30.818
Well, maybe they both should have one.
Get it out of their system.

14:30.892 --> 14:33.190
Have an affair? Be unfaithful?

14:34.195 --> 14:38.928
Well, sometimes I think
fidelity is highly overrated.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.198
Uh, nobody looks at the downside.
There's a downside to being faithful?

14:43.271 --> 14:47.469
Of course.
It discourages social interaction.

14:47.542 --> 14:52.639
Look, Sam, if all the men
in all the world could freely...

14:52.714 --> 14:58.209
socialize with all the women in all the world,
there would be no war.

14:58.286 --> 15:02.154
Until their wives found out.
Good point.

15:02.223 --> 15:04.714
Hmm.
Well, maybe your mission here...

15:04.793 --> 15:08.058
isn't to keep, uh, Irene orJoe
from having an affair.

15:08.129 --> 15:11.724
It's just to see that
neither of them finds out...

15:11.800 --> 15:15.133
about the other one.
Oh, that's ridiculous.

15:15.203 --> 15:18.434
Fidelity is the basis
of a good relationship.

15:18.506 --> 15:21.566
Course, I couldn't expect you
to understand that, could I?

15:22.977 --> 15:25.912
My relationships have all been good.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.107
It's my marriages
that haven't worked out.

Karen, what's wrong?

17:46.287 --> 17:49.017
That's Danny's guitar.

17:49.090 --> 17:51.081
<i>[Irene]</i>
<i>Dinner!</i>

17:54.562 --> 17:58.931
The meat's a little tough,
isn't it, Joe?
No, it's fine.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.458
No. You can say.
It's a little tough.

18:02.537 --> 18:06.940
It's that, uh,
new butcher on, um...
Irene, the meat is fine.

18:09.344 --> 18:13.610
<i>I can go back to Glicksman's.</i>
Mother, he said it's fine!

18:15.450 --> 18:17.782
Karen, don't use
that tone of voice with me.

18:19.654 --> 18:23.454
<i>It was my fault.</i>
<i>Um, I think I upset Karen...</i>

18:23.525 --> 18:27.552
when I wanted to play...
Danny's guitar.

18:30.632 --> 18:32.964
It's all right, Uncle David.

18:33.034 --> 18:36.765
Well, maybe it's time
someone played it.
Irene.

18:40.408 --> 18:43.639
It's been a year, Joe.
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:48.216 --> 18:51.708
- It's time we set the headstone.
- Headstone?

18:51.786 --> 18:54.880
<i>Irene.</i>
David,

18:54.956 --> 18:59.120
will you be conducting the ceremony,
or should Joe and I prepare something to say?

18:59.193 --> 19:02.458
I said, I don't want to discuss it.
It's important.

19:02.530 --> 19:04.657
Damn it!

19:09.837 --> 19:13.739
<i>[Thinking]</i>
<i>They'd lost a son.</i>
<i>This family was being torn apart...</i>

<i>because no one wanted</i>

19:19.514 --> 19:22.074
Would anyone mind
if I spent the night?

<i>They're, uh, fumigating</i>
<i>over at my... place.</i>

19:29.023 --> 19:31.014
Of course not.

19:56.217 --> 19:59.243
Is this, uh, where I'm sleeping?

19:59.320 --> 20:01.481
It's the only extra bed.

20:04.993 --> 20:09.054
Would you like a...
soft pillow or a firm pillow?

20:11.165 --> 20:13.963
Uh, f... Uh, f-firm, please.

20:25.079 --> 20:27.809
<i>[Irene]</i>
<i>Danny loved this room.</i>

20:27.882 --> 20:32.615
Of course, he said he couldn't wait
to leave to go to Yale, but he loved it.

20:33.988 --> 20:36.320
He brought a lot of
friends up here, and...

20:36.391 --> 20:40.327
when he was 16, he said he wanted
to bring girls up in here.

20:40.395 --> 20:42.386
I said, "No."

20:43.698 --> 20:46.064
I mean, girls here?

20:47.535 --> 20:50.265
"What's the matter, Mom?
Don't you trust me?"

"You, I trust.
It's the girls I'm worried about!"

20:55.743 --> 20:57.734

20:59.414 --> 21:01.746
Do you remember his laugh,
David?

21:03.584 --> 21:05.745
He had a great laugh.
Yeah.

21:07.655 --> 21:11.557
I couldn't say no to Danny
when he laughed.
Not when he laughed.

21:15.229 --> 21:18.164
He laughed when I told him
thatJoe and I were nervous...

21:18.232 --> 21:22.430
about he and Mark
going backpacking alone in Europe.

21:22.503 --> 21:26.599
I had to talkJoe into letting him go.
I had to.

21:28.276 --> 21:30.437
Danny loved you for that.

21:36.117 --> 21:38.813

when the plane crashed?

21:40.722 --> 21:42.713
[Sobbing]
Oh, David.

21:46.427 --> 21:49.794
Do you think he was thinking
of me when he was dying?

22:02.176 --> 22:04.167
He loved you, Irene.

22:07.315 --> 22:10.409
He loved you
when you were with him.

22:10.485 --> 22:12.646
You'll always be with him.

No. No.
I killed my Danny!

22:26.167 --> 22:29.603
No, you didn't kill him.
The accident killed him.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.763
It's not your fault.

22:34.742 --> 22:37.575
Joe thinks so.
Joe is wrong.

23:08.376 --> 23:10.310
Uh, yeah, f-firm. That'd be great.

Nothing.

Nothing.
You're Irene's future lover, right?

23:53.221 --> 23:55.155
Right.
Well, don't do it,

23:55.223 --> 23:59.421

have an affair with Irene.

24:02.296 --> 24:05.163

Okay. No problem.

Figured this was too easy.
Is Irene falling in love with me?

24:23.417 --> 24:27.410
I don't know.
I think she's falling in need with you.

24:27.488 --> 24:31.822
I think she needs for you to...
to help her get back
to the man she really loves.

24:31.893 --> 24:34.760
Joe.
Yeah.
And to keep the family together.

24:34.829 --> 24:39.027
You know,
I think that's what it's about.
It's about family.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.364
I... I never realized...

24:41.435 --> 24:45.132
how much family meant to me
until after Ruthie was gone.

24:48.709 --> 24:51.542
I know what you mean, Al.

24:51.612 --> 24:56.982
You know, sometimes I wish
I could go home, but I... can't.

24:57.051 --> 25:01.750
Then all I have is what I can remember,
which... is not a whole hell of a lot.

No, really, Bert.

34:11.103 --> 34:14.938
In the first place,
he's not a widower.

34:15.007 --> 34:17.636
His wife is still alive?
He was never even married.

34:17.710 --> 34:21.772
He just uses that
to get women for his research.

34:21.849 --> 34:24.841
For the book.
Yeah.
I read the stupid thing.

34:24.918 --> 34:29.581
It was a best seller in '75
called <i>Women In Pain.</i>

34:29.656 --> 34:33.387
Ah!
Irene is chapter six.

34:33.460 --> 34:37.418
Whatever you do,
don't let her get near that <i>yutz.</i>

35:08.395 --> 35:10.386
<i>[Car Door Shuts]</i>

35:11.498 --> 35:13.489
<i>[Engine Starts]</i>

35:22.242 --> 35:24.233
Daddy?

35:25.345 --> 35:27.506
It's late. Go to bed.

35:30.017 --> 35:34.579
Oh, Karen. Do you know
where your Uncle David went?

35:34.655 --> 35:37.488
He asked for directions
to the beach house.

35:45.799 --> 35:49.394
<i>[Irene]</i>
<i>Sometimes I actually expect to see Danny</i>
<i>come running through that door,</i>

35:49.469 --> 35:52.302
<i>covered in sand,</i>
<i>looking for something to eat.</i>

35:52.372 --> 35:56.138
But he never will again.

35:56.209 --> 35:58.200
Never again.

35:59.379 --> 36:02.405
I know how you feel, Irene.
I...

36:02.482 --> 36:05.679
I felt the same way
after my Delores died...

36:05.752 --> 36:07.743
a void,

36:07.821 --> 36:10.221
an emptiness in my life that...

36:11.224 --> 36:13.454
that I thought
could never be filled.

36:15.295 --> 36:18.890
In fact, for a long time, I...

36:18.966 --> 36:21.298
I blamed myself for her death.

36:22.469 --> 36:24.903
I blame myself too.

36:26.239 --> 36:28.730
It takes a long time to heal,
Irene,

36:28.809 --> 36:30.800
if one ever does.

36:36.683 --> 36:38.742
No. No, don't.

36:38.819 --> 36:40.980
You've been through so much.

36:43.123 --> 36:47.116
You need someone who...
who understands.

36:47.194 --> 36:50.857
Someone who...
can feel your pain.

36:59.039 --> 37:01.701
This is wrong.

37:01.775 --> 37:04.608
Ah!

37:04.678 --> 37:08.671
It's... It's all right
to feel good, Irene...

37:08.749 --> 37:11.309
to smile, to laugh,

37:12.319 --> 37:14.310
to love,

37:15.389 --> 37:17.380
and to be loved.

37:22.162 --> 37:24.528
I have never done this before.

37:24.598 --> 37:27.863
I know, I know. Neither have I.

37:58.665 --> 38:01.156
David.
Could I come in?

38:05.639 --> 38:08.233
<i>[Door Shuts]</i>
<i>Bert saw my lights on,</i>

38:08.308 --> 38:11.436
and, um, he came over.

38:11.511 --> 38:14.571
- We've been talking.
- About your dead wife?

38:14.648 --> 38:17.276
Well, it-it came up.

38:17.350 --> 38:20.649
We've both had tragic losses.
<i>Only hers was real.</i>

38:20.721 --> 38:22.712
What do you mean?

38:22.789 --> 38:26.384
Bert never lost a wife,
because he's never been married.

38:26.460 --> 38:29.918
It's all a lie.
What?

38:29.996 --> 38:33.659
It's-It's not what you think,
Irene. I...

38:33.734 --> 38:38.433
I try to identify with the women
that I interview...
to feel what they feel...

38:38.505 --> 38:41.963
<i>so that I can write from the heart.</i>
There have been others?

38:42.042 --> 38:46.775
Well, it-it's not criminal to try
and understand female emotions.

38:46.847 --> 38:51.784
- Emotional rape is a crime.
- This isn't rape. It-It's research.

38:51.852 --> 38:56.016
- Well, I will not be researched!
- Irene, I...

38:56.089 --> 38:58.614
Uh!
[Sniffling]
Irene, Irene. That's enough.

38:58.692 --> 39:00.683
Now, look, Rabbi...

39:06.767 --> 39:09.201
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Oh, David,

39:09.269 --> 39:11.533
I'm so ashamed.
<i>[Car Engine Starts]</i>

39:11.605 --> 39:16.702
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
I just wanted someone
to talk to, and...

39:16.777 --> 39:21.544
Oh, God, I feel like such a fool.
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right.

39:24.084 --> 39:27.542
<i>My brother and my wife.</i>
<i>I should have known.</i>

39:27.621 --> 39:31.819
- Joe, look...
- I don't wanna hear it!

39:37.764 --> 39:40.995
Joe. Joe, look, I'm not gonna
let you walk away from this.

39:41.067 --> 39:45.026
Were you eyeing her at my dinner table?
Did it happen in my home?

39:45.105 --> 39:48.506
You don't know what
you're talking about.
Little Davey, always the smart one.

39:48.575 --> 39:50.975
Always the best.
You always got what you want.

39:51.044 --> 39:53.979
Well, not my wife, David.
Not my wife!

39:55.148 --> 39:57.275
Sam, he hit you!

39:57.350 --> 40:00.342
That's great!
That means he still loves her.

40:00.420 --> 40:03.150
Let him hit ya again.
Look, Joe...

40:03.723 --> 40:05.714
I got ya, Sam.

40:05.792 --> 40:08.693
Uhh!
I don't got ya, Sam.

40:08.762 --> 40:12.095
- Come on. Get up! Fight me!
- Stop fighting!

40:12.165 --> 40:15.828
Get up. Come on.
Get up. Fight me!
Come on, come on. Fight me!

40:15.902 --> 40:21.306
No. Uhh!
Joe, just stop!
You're hurting him!

40:21.374 --> 40:25.174
- Irene, I'll never forgive you for this!
- For this or for Danny?

40:25.245 --> 40:27.907
<i>I mean, that's what this is</i>
<i>really all about isn't it, Joe?</i>

40:27.981 --> 40:31.075
You know Irene and I
are not having an affair.

40:32.085 --> 40:36.852
You've never forgiven her for letting
Danny go to Europe. You think she
wanted him to die on that plane?

40:36.923 --> 40:39.585
<i>You're punishing her for something</i>
<i>she could have never prevented.</i>

40:39.659 --> 40:42.685
Then why does she keep
vacuuming his bedroom?

40:42.762 --> 40:45.856
Cooking his favorite foods?
My son is gone!

40:50.904 --> 40:55.534
[Crying]
And I don't understand why she
keeps vacuuming his damn bedroom!

41:04.918 --> 41:07.682
When I sit in his room,

41:07.754 --> 41:09.984
he's there.

41:10.056 --> 41:14.959
He's at college or on vacation,
but he's there.

41:16.096 --> 41:18.496
<i>I feel him.</i>

41:19.566 --> 41:21.557
I keep driving...

41:22.836 --> 41:25.066
past the park...

41:25.138 --> 41:27.299
where he played little league,

41:29.342 --> 41:32.470
and I see him sometimes
out in left field...

41:34.648 --> 41:36.639
waving.

41:38.485 --> 41:41.249
He's waving to me.

41:42.822 --> 41:46.189
I loved him, Irene.
Oh, and he's gone.

41:46.259 --> 41:49.422
Oh!
I know.

41:49.496 --> 41:52.363
I know. I loved him too.

41:57.404 --> 41:59.895
He was so good.
He was so smart.

41:59.973 --> 42:03.875
He was so...
He was so alive.

42:03.944 --> 42:06.936
Oh, God, I miss him so!

42:07.013 --> 42:10.312
I do too, Joe. I do too.
I miss him.

42:16.156 --> 42:18.317
Can you still love me?

42:21.461 --> 42:24.760
Can you?
I will always love you.

42:33.039 --> 42:35.030
[Clicks, Squeaks]

42:35.108 --> 42:38.441
Good, Sam.
You can really take a punch.

42:38.511 --> 42:43.073
Mazel tov.
Uh, Bert Glasserman's book
never made it to the best-seller list.

42:43.149 --> 42:47.017
Irene told someone
named Bonnie Teller
about Bert's techniques,

42:47.087 --> 42:49.681
and the-the word spread
like wildfire.

42:49.756 --> 42:54.193
Six libel suits later,
the publisher yanked the book
before it ever hit the stands.

42:54.260 --> 42:56.626
And Bert, he's got a life sentence
with a shrink.

42:56.696 --> 42:59.597
What about Irene and Joe?
Uhh...

43:00.967 --> 43:03.629
<i>Oh, well, they wrote</i>
<i>a book themselves,</i>

43:03.703 --> 43:07.799
<i>and it helped parents all over the country</i>
<i>deal with the loss of a child.</i>

<i>So I'd say it was a job well done, my boy.</i>
<i>Leap in good health.</i>
