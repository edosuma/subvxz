01:17.540 --> 01:20.170
Oh, relax for once, Spot!

01:20.170 --> 01:23.960
Hang ten on the cosmic
surfboard of freedom!

01:23.960 --> 01:26.170
Cadpig,
your metaphysical metaphors

01:26.170 --> 01:28.080
are getting weirder
and weirder.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.120
Here it comes!

01:33.830 --> 01:35.500
Lucky: Oh, yes!

01:35.500 --> 01:39.330
There's nothing like
a harvest moon for howling at!

01:44.250 --> 01:46.960
Shh! You'll wake somebody.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.960
Let go, Spot!
Be free!

01:49.960 --> 01:52.920
Release
the inner puppy!

01:56.460 --> 01:58.120
Ahem!

01:58.120 --> 02:01.040
Bawk-bawk bawk-aaaaaa!

02:01.040 --> 02:03.420
Hey, that does feel good.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.460
But you gotta put
your head back,
Spot, like this.

02:06.460 --> 02:11.000
Ow-oooooooh!

02:11.000 --> 02:13.960
Bawk-bawk-aaaaaaaa!

02:13.960 --> 02:15.830
Yow! Ugh!

02:15.830 --> 02:18.920
Oww! Ugh! Whoaaaa!

02:20.080 --> 02:21.920
Owww!

02:21.920 --> 02:24.040
Oh, hi, Mom.
Hee hee.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.540
Can't sleep?

02:25.540 --> 02:27.920
And just what
have you been up to?

02:27.920 --> 02:30.380
Uh, howling
at the moon?

02:30.380 --> 02:33.960
Again with the dog act?
What next?

02:33.960 --> 02:35.620
Walking

02:35.620 --> 02:37.620
Fire hydrants?

02:37.620 --> 02:40.830
That was one time,
and it was an accident.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.620
Well, it's not going
to happen again.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.420
From now on, you're
going to spend some time

02:45.420 --> 02:47.420
being a chicken,
young pullet.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.620
Hey, Spot, we're
going to go roll
in the dirt.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.750
Wanna come?

02:53.750 --> 02:56.920
Can't. I'm sitting on an egg.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.330
Ahh! Just shoot me now.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.960
It's Mom's orders.

03:04.960 --> 03:08.210
She says I'm spending
too much time with you guys.

03:08.210 --> 03:11.540
Why, that's Dalmatian
discrimination.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.120
Don't let
your mother's intolerance

03:13.120 --> 03:14.960
crush your individuality.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.500
Fight oppression, my sister.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.250
Aww, come on, Spot,
it's just one roll in the dirt.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.880
Well...

03:22.880 --> 03:27.120
I guess just one wouldn't hurt.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.040
Fleas?

03:48.040 --> 03:50.920
There are fleas
in our henhouse!

03:53.960 --> 03:57.880
Impossible! How could fleas
get into our...

03:57.880 --> 03:59.920
precious, tidy...

04:02.620 --> 04:04.250
What?

04:04.250 --> 04:07.170
You were with
those dogs again

04:07.170 --> 04:09.620
when you were
supposed to be
egg sitting!

04:09.620 --> 04:10.790
I... I...

04:10.790 --> 04:11.920
That's it!

04:11.920 --> 04:14.170
From now on,
you are forbidden

04:14.170 --> 04:16.500
to spend any more time
with those pups!

04:16.500 --> 04:18.960
B-but they're
my best friends!

04:18.960 --> 04:20.620
They make me feel,
well...

04:20.620 --> 04:22.460
like a dog!

04:22.460 --> 04:25.920
Ooh!
You are a chicken!

04:25.920 --> 04:28.880
Get it?
Feathers

04:28.880 --> 04:30.290
Cock

04:30.290 --> 04:32.960
Any of this sound familiar?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.210
I am not a chicken!

04:34.210 --> 04:37.460
I may walk like a chicken
and talk like a chicken,

04:37.460 --> 04:40.210
but inside,
I am all dog!

04:40.210 --> 04:43.380
And I'm gonna hang out
with whoever I want to.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.290
While living in
my henhouse,

04:45.290 --> 04:47.750
you'll abide
by my rules!

04:47.750 --> 04:49.920
Well, maybe
I don't want to live

04:49.920 --> 04:52.580
in your stupid
henhouse anymore!

05:00.790 --> 05:01.880
Waaaah!

05:07.960 --> 05:10.790
A chicken can only take
so much oppression.

05:10.790 --> 05:13.830
I'm gonna run away
and live with the pups!

05:17.000 --> 05:18.880
Hey, you guys, wake up!

05:21.290 --> 05:22.540
Huh?

05:22.540 --> 05:26.290
Guess what,
I am a dog!

05:26.290 --> 05:28.960
Yeah, yeah,
I'll alert the media.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.790
Now go back to sleep.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.750
No, really.
I'm moving in with you guys.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.540
Full-time!

05:35.540 --> 05:37.540
I thought you already

05:37.540 --> 05:39.080
lived with us.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.250
I'll see you

05:40.250 --> 05:42.000
in the morning.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.380
This time it's for good.
I ran way from home.

05:45.380 --> 05:48.750
Come on, guys, let's be dogs!
Arf!

05:48.750 --> 05:51.040
Let's howl at the moon
some more!

05:51.040 --> 05:54.120
Ow-oooh! Let's chase cars!
Let's...

05:54.120 --> 05:55.880
Lucky: You know one
of the great things

05:55.880 --> 05:58.330
about being a dog,
Spot?

05:58.330 --> 06:00.710
Sleeping.

06:00.710 --> 06:01.790
Sleeping, right.

06:01.790 --> 06:04.120
Let sleeping dogs lie.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.710
I can do that.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.250
This is great!

06:14.250 --> 06:15.960
Shhh!

06:19.750 --> 06:22.830
Morning!
Let's romp-and-roll!

06:22.830 --> 06:25.380
Whoo-hoo, I'm awake!

06:25.380 --> 06:26.670
I am a canine!

06:26.670 --> 06:29.290
And I'm chasing
my tail!

06:31.500 --> 06:34.210
Breakfast!
let's eat some kibbles!

06:41.670 --> 06:43.120
Yum-yum....

06:50.830 --> 06:54.330
Sorry, but I'm
a full-fledged dog now

06:54.330 --> 06:56.330
with a dog-size appetite.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.830
Come on, let's go dig bones!

06:58.830 --> 07:03.000
Ow, ow, ow, oww!
Ow, ow, ow, oww!

07:03.000 --> 07:07.170
I believe we have created
a monster.

07:14.250 --> 07:18.670
There's nothing we dogs like
better than freshly tilled dirt.

07:20.710 --> 07:22.580
Wait, spot, no!

07:24.080 --> 07:26.540
Oh! Out!
Out, out, out!

07:28.210 --> 07:29.620
Shoo!

07:29.620 --> 07:32.790
No doggy treats for you
naughty pups for a week!

07:34.620 --> 07:38.710
I don't know why I didn't
do this a long time ago.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.620
I'm too excited.
Let's play fetch!

07:40.620 --> 07:42.040
By my rough count,

07:42.040 --> 07:43.750
we've already
played fetch

07:43.750 --> 07:45.330
a zillion times
today.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.380
Oh, there's nothing
left to fetch.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.500
Why don't you go, Spot?

07:50.500 --> 07:52.880
Dogs love to play
solitaire fetch.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.210
They do?

07:54.210 --> 07:56.120
I mean, we do?

07:56.120 --> 07:58.000
all: Oh, yeah!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.960
Okeydokey, if it's a dog thing.

08:04.670 --> 08:08.040
Lucky: Finally.
Rolly: I'm all dogged out.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.170
Cadpig: Me too.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.000
I'm all in favor
of stretching boundaries

08:11.000 --> 08:13.670
and interfacing with personal
growth potentialities,

08:13.670 --> 08:16.750
but... she's becoming
a wacko!

08:16.750 --> 08:20.580
Lucky: When's she gonna
face the fact that
she's just not a dog?

08:20.580 --> 08:23.120
Oh, they're right.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.540
Not a dog.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.710
Not a chicken.

08:27.710 --> 08:30.540
I just don't fit in anywhere.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.750
Not here, anyway.

08:32.750 --> 08:36.750
It's time for me to find
my true self,

08:36.750 --> 08:39.880
to stand on my own
two drumsticks.

08:41.920 --> 08:46.790
Yes, sir, I'm gonna be
a free-range chicken.

08:53.170 --> 08:55.750
Bawk-aaaa! She's gone!

08:55.750 --> 08:57.830
You pups put her up to this!

08:57.830 --> 09:01.420
Putting all those subversive
four-legged ideas in her head!

09:01.420 --> 09:03.830
Whoa, whoa, easy, slow down.

09:03.830 --> 09:05.040
Who's gone?

09:05.040 --> 09:08.420
As if you didn't know!

09:11.210 --> 09:14.120
It's all chicken scratch to me.
What's it say?

09:14.120 --> 09:16.620
mother: "Not a chicken,
not a dog.

09:16.620 --> 09:20.670
Have left to interface
with my growth potentialities.

09:20.670 --> 09:22.120
Farewell."

09:22.120 --> 09:25.500
Only one beast on this farm
talks like that.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.790
What can I say,
it's a precious gift.

09:28.790 --> 09:31.580
She must have heard us talking
about her last night.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.250
Aww, man,
first we get her busted,

09:34.250 --> 09:36.500
and then we make her run away.

09:36.500 --> 09:41.960
Ooch. Anybody else feel
about a ton of bad karma
weighing on their shoulders?

09:48.080 --> 09:51.120
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll find your daughter.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.710
Hey, b-b-birds
of a feather,
flocking together.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.580
Hi there.
What are you guys doing?

10:12.580 --> 10:15.420
We're line dancing.
What does it look
like we're doing?

10:15.420 --> 10:16.620
We're migrating.

10:16.620 --> 10:19.670
How exciting!
The jet stream set!

10:19.670 --> 10:22.290
No henhouse fever
for you!

10:22.290 --> 10:25.670
Travel, excitement,
exotic destinations.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.380
Mind if I tag along?

10:27.380 --> 10:30.080
Uh, yeah, sure,
Clucky.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.330
If you can keep up

10:31.330 --> 10:33.830
with that oversized
rear spoiler
of yours.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.830
Okay, guys,
break's over.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.580
Let's move it out!

10:37.580 --> 10:41.830
These breaks are gettin'
shorter and shorter!

10:46.540 --> 10:48.620
There she is!

10:50.880 --> 10:53.880
Cruisin' altitude's
at 5,000 feet.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.580
See you there!

10:56.960 --> 10:58.170
5,000?

10:58.170 --> 11:00.670
I'm lucky if I can make 5!

11:04.080 --> 11:05.960
-Rolly: No, Spot!

11:05.960 --> 11:07.380
Look in front of you!

11:09.960 --> 11:12.540
all: Come back!

11:12.540 --> 11:16.540
Mayday.
This goose is down.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.580
Lucky: I saw this
in a Thunderbolt movie.

11:23.580 --> 11:24.960
Jump!

11:28.960 --> 11:30.920
Is this what happened
in the movie?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.380
Look!

11:33.380 --> 11:36.080
puppies:
Hey, Spot!

11:40.580 --> 11:43.380
Yep, I'm free as a bird.

11:43.380 --> 11:47.420
No one to tell me what to do,
when to go to bed.

11:50.420 --> 11:51.420
Bed?

11:58.790 --> 12:00.210
Yuck!

12:01.670 --> 12:03.330
Free as a bird.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.120
Yeah, yeah.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.460
Chicken scent's
getting stronger.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.460
Stronger!

12:12.460 --> 12:15.960
Funny, though, it has
a slight bouquet of...

12:17.710 --> 12:19.580
...barbecue.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.330
Oh, no, she's been
turned into fried chicken.

12:22.330 --> 12:25.080
That stuff just
oozes cholesterol.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.620
Aww, she's not fried.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.960
This dumb bucket just
threw me off the scent.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.420
But I bet she's
around here somewhere.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.790
Maybe right under our noses.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.380
Come on!

12:40.420 --> 12:42.120
Whaddya say, Roscoe?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.380
Takeout for breakfast?

12:43.380 --> 12:46.250
Yeah. Sounds good
to me, Bruno.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.080
Aaaaaah!

12:52.460 --> 12:54.880
Wait a minute. Cats!

12:54.880 --> 12:56.040
That's it!

12:56.040 --> 12:58.330
Hey, can you two
teach me to be a cat?

12:58.330 --> 13:01.120
I tried being a chicken,
a dog, a goose,

13:01.120 --> 13:04.420
but nothin's cooler
than an alley cat.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.880
Um, actually, we was
thinking of eating you.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.620
Hey, you eat me,
that's one meal.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.290
Let me be an alley cat,

13:12.290 --> 13:14.420
and I'll help you find
lots of meals.

13:14.420 --> 13:18.170
I'm smart,
and I can fly!

13:18.170 --> 13:19.250
Whoaaa!

13:19.250 --> 13:20.620
Uh, sort of.

13:20.620 --> 13:24.250
Say, maybe
this dumb cluck
could help us.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.330
Yeah, with that
heist on Luigi's,
yeah, huh?

13:27.330 --> 13:32.460
Okay, egghead,
you're our bestest buddy!

13:32.460 --> 13:35.710
We'll show you how
us alley cats get a meal.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.620
Right this way.

13:38.790 --> 13:41.330
Oh, boy,
this'll be great.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.380
Let's see, I'll need
a cool cat name.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.080
Uh, Electra!

13:45.080 --> 13:46.710
No, Cosmo.

13:46.710 --> 13:49.040
No, uh, something
with dignity.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.080
Dr. Mildred Cat?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.790
Yowwww!

13:52.790 --> 13:54.210
Luigi's Kitchen.

13:54.210 --> 13:56.080
Budda-bing!

13:56.080 --> 13:58.670
The holy grail
of alley cats.

13:58.670 --> 14:02.580
You think youse
could get us into
that open window

14:02.580 --> 14:04.250
and let us in
the back?

14:04.250 --> 14:06.420
Sure!

14:14.880 --> 14:16.710
Bruno, what if
this don't work?

14:16.710 --> 14:18.210
We eat her.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.210
And if it do work?

14:20.210 --> 14:22.250
Um...
We eat her.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.920
This is what
they call

14:23.920 --> 14:25.210
a win-win
situation.

14:25.210 --> 14:26.420
Heh!

14:33.790 --> 14:36.330
Hey, fellas,
I got us in!

14:36.330 --> 14:39.710
Yeah, we'll give you your reward
at dinnertime.

14:39.710 --> 14:40.830
Right, Roscoe?

14:40.830 --> 14:43.380
Yeah, right, dinnertime.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.620
man: Get outta here,
you mangy cats!

14:46.620 --> 14:50.170
You ain't gonna have
no bigga night here!

14:52.170 --> 14:54.500
Ohh!

14:54.500 --> 14:58.960
But you, I could make
a nice tasty parmigiana
out of you.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.620
Nobody's rolling me
in breadcrumbs!

15:07.000 --> 15:09.710
Lucky: Hey, there she is!

15:09.710 --> 15:10.830
Spot!

15:10.830 --> 15:13.170
Wait, Spot!

15:13.170 --> 15:14.540
It's us!

15:20.540 --> 15:21.830
Where'd she go?

15:24.040 --> 15:26.750
I hate a parade.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.290
Oh, this is ridiculous.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.250
I never should have run away.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.620
elephant: A runaway, huh?

15:32.620 --> 15:37.040
Why don't you join the circus?
It's a classic move.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.920
Run away and join the circus?
Hmm.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.250
It's almost corny enough
to work.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.170
Maybe all my troubles
are finally over.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.120
She just vanished.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.580
Like food in front
of Rolly.

15:56.580 --> 16:00.670
Hey! You suppose
she got scooped up
in that circus parade?

16:00.670 --> 16:03.040
I saw a big top when we passed
the fairground.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.210
Come on!

16:06.120 --> 16:08.790
Cruella: "Diversify,"
my accountant said.

16:08.790 --> 16:11.250
"Buy a circus," he said.

16:11.250 --> 16:14.250
Memo to myself:
Shoot accountant
out of cannon.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.790
Local ordinances
protecting elephants.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.960
Local ordinances
protecting bears,

16:19.960 --> 16:21.250
lions, tigers.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.120
We need an animal
we can rough up
a little.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.210
That's what
people want.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.040
Ha ha!

16:30.040 --> 16:34.250
There are no
ordinances protecting
circus chickens!

16:34.250 --> 16:35.420
Grab it!

16:36.880 --> 16:38.210
You hear that,
chicken?

16:38.210 --> 16:40.210
You're gonna be
a star.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.620
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

16:43.620 --> 16:45.420
welcome to Cirque de Vil,

16:45.420 --> 16:50.170
an exciting blend of New Age
and Old Vaudeville.

16:50.170 --> 16:53.250
And now the star of our show,

16:53.250 --> 16:56.670
Zoroaster, the Wonder Chicken!

16:56.670 --> 16:58.250
I'm a star!

16:59.380 --> 17:01.670
If only mom
could see me now.

17:01.670 --> 17:04.540
Cruella: Zoroaster's first
bone-breaking performance

17:04.540 --> 17:08.710
will be with
the Bouncing Bocce Brothers!

17:08.710 --> 17:09.790
There she is!

17:09.790 --> 17:11.380
What have we done?

17:17.420 --> 17:19.000
We've gotta get her
out of here.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Spot!

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
Spot, squawking:
What do you three want?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.170
Waaaah!

17:25.170 --> 17:27.380
We want you to come home!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.960
Spot: I'm not a dog,
you said.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.080
Yowwwww!

17:31.080 --> 17:35.750
Well, you're right.
Now I'm a star!

17:35.750 --> 17:38.120
Whoaaaaa!

17:42.040 --> 17:44.830
Horace, Jasper,
get those blasted pups

17:44.830 --> 17:46.620
out of my center ring!

17:46.620 --> 17:47.710
Jasper: Yes, ma'am.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.210
Where is Spot?

17:53.210 --> 17:57.380
Cruella: And now Zoroaster
will join the Flying Finn Family

17:57.380 --> 17:58.960
on the trapeze!

17:58.960 --> 18:01.460
Aaaaaaah...!

18:03.330 --> 18:06.120
How do I tell her
I don't have hands?

18:07.500 --> 18:10.710
I'm just going to live my life
assuming there was a net there.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.040
Ugggh!

18:12.040 --> 18:13.880
Okay, now's our chance.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.330
Aaaaah!

18:16.460 --> 18:18.210
Next up in the center ring,

18:18.210 --> 18:21.620
it's Zoroaster, the lion tamer!

18:25.170 --> 18:27.460
Waaaaaa!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.460
Nice kitty.

18:32.460 --> 18:33.960
Sit. Sit.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.080
Okay, I'll sit.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.250
I can't bear to watch
the food chain in action.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.330
Spot, you don't
have to do this!

18:43.330 --> 18:46.000
You're our
best friend,
buddy, tail or no!

18:46.000 --> 18:48.380
Spot, come back home!

18:48.380 --> 18:51.120
What, and give up show biz?

18:51.120 --> 18:54.580
Yowwwwww!

18:59.250 --> 19:02.210
As a performer,
this foul is a fizzle.

19:02.210 --> 19:05.830
Only one job left
in Cirque de Vil.

19:06.960 --> 19:11.040
Step right up and see
the fabulous furry freak show!

19:11.040 --> 19:14.620
Starring Zoroaster,
the chicken dog!

19:14.620 --> 19:16.960
It's not a chicken,
it's not a dog!

19:16.960 --> 19:19.620
It's not anything
known to man!

19:19.620 --> 19:20.670
It barks...

19:21.830 --> 19:23.170
It fetches...

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
It grovels pathetically
at your feet

19:27.500 --> 19:29.460
in a desperate plea
for attention,

19:29.460 --> 19:31.790
just like a real dog!

19:31.790 --> 19:34.710
You heard the ringmaster,
chicken dog.

19:34.710 --> 19:36.080
Grovel!

19:36.080 --> 19:37.620
Don't do it, Spot.

19:37.620 --> 19:38.830
Oh...

19:42.120 --> 19:43.880
No! Uh-uh!

19:45.540 --> 19:48.420
(Horace yelling,
Spot barking)

19:48.420 --> 19:51.380
You idiots, you're running
from a chicken!

19:51.380 --> 19:53.830
Horace: Y-yeah, I knew that.

19:53.830 --> 19:55.880
Spot: Okay, I'm not a dog.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.170
I'm just a chicken
who acts like a dog!

19:58.170 --> 20:00.080
And I wanna go home!

20:00.080 --> 20:02.710
Lucky, Rolly, Cadpig!

20:02.710 --> 20:04.540
Helppppp!

20:04.540 --> 20:05.920
That's our cue.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.290
Rescue mode.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.540
A little help?

20:10.880 --> 20:12.880
Thanks!

20:14.210 --> 20:15.920
Jasper: Wait till I get
my hands on you!

20:17.620 --> 20:18.880
Whoaaaa!

20:21.210 --> 20:24.670
Cruella: After them,
you center ringworms!

20:24.670 --> 20:26.080
Up there!

20:32.120 --> 20:33.880
Get on my back.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.790
I can't see.

20:35.790 --> 20:37.620
Take that!

20:37.620 --> 20:40.830
Look at you
and your big ideas!

20:40.830 --> 20:42.540
Whoaaaaa!

20:44.750 --> 20:46.960
What now?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.880
Well, I can fly.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.960
Sort of.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.790
Great!
Grab the rope.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Cadpig: She made it!

20:57.880 --> 20:59.620
And we made it!

20:59.620 --> 21:02.080
all: Wheeeee!

21:04.830 --> 21:06.040
Thank you!

21:06.040 --> 21:07.830
Any old time.

21:07.830 --> 21:10.380
Now let's get you home before
you're grounded for life.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.880
Baby, you're alive!

21:15.880 --> 21:17.620
Oooooh!

21:17.620 --> 21:20.170
Not if you squeeze me
to death, Mom.

21:20.170 --> 21:22.750
Thank you for bringing
my baby home.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.750
You pups are okay by me.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.960
Hey, what are
friends for?

21:27.960 --> 21:31.290
Ha ha! Guess I'm not
in trouble anymore.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.540
mother: Guess again!

21:32.540 --> 21:36.880
You are grounded for a month,
if you're lucky!

21:36.880 --> 21:38.750
Okay.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.920
I guess running away
from your troubles
doesn't solve them.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.170
But I did realize
one thing.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.500
What's that?

21:45.500 --> 21:47.960
I'd like you
to respect me
for what I am.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.960
I'm not just
a chicken.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.750
I'm not
just a dog.

21:51.750 --> 21:55.040
I'm me, a chicken
who acts like a dog.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.380
And I'm
proud of it!

21:59.380 --> 22:01.210
Oh, all right.

22:01.210 --> 22:05.080
But would it hurt you
to sit on an egg
every once in a while?

22:05.080 --> 22:06.830
For me?

22:08.880 --> 22:11.210
Oh, I'll never
get used to this.
