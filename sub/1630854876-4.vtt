00:01.760 --> 00:03.175
<i>Previously on "The Company You Keep"...</i>

00:03.175 --> 00:05.212
- You must be Emma.
- This is my mom.

00:05.212 --> 00:08.008
- Fran. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.319
<i>I mean, my dad's
startin' to slip</i>

00:09.319 --> 00:12.253
a little bit.
- That sounds brutal.

00:12.253 --> 00:13.565
Yeah, it is.

00:13.565 --> 00:16.602
<i>David, this is Claire Fox.</i>

00:16.602 --> 00:17.845
<i>We should talk.</i>

00:17.845 --> 00:19.674
<i>I'm not who you think I am.</i>

00:19.674 --> 00:21.366
How can Daphne make
such a big payment

00:21.366 --> 00:23.678
if she's selling their product
at bargain basement prices?

00:23.678 --> 00:25.611
She's not selling off
to get out.

00:25.611 --> 00:27.268
<i>She's currying favor
with rivals,</i>

00:27.268 --> 00:30.168
<i>which means she's building
something even bigger.</i>

00:30.168 --> 00:32.791
I'm not gettin' myself
or my family picked up

00:32.791 --> 00:35.035
just to make good
on your payment schedule.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.864
Try explaining that
to Connor.

00:36.864 --> 00:38.210
You remember
the guy you ripped off

00:38.210 --> 00:40.350
whose father is now locked up,
thanks to you?

00:40.350 --> 00:42.456
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that your sister's

00:42.456 --> 00:44.251
takin' a run at your crown.

00:44.251 --> 00:45.528
I don't have a sister.

00:45.528 --> 00:47.047
<i>Sure about that?</i>

01:03.546 --> 01:05.962
What is this?

01:05.962 --> 01:07.929
We just have a few questions.

01:09.241 --> 01:11.899
<i>Who exactly
has a few questions?</i>

01:11.899 --> 01:13.073
What the hell, Cas?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.902
Was a black bag
seriously necessary?

01:14.902 --> 01:17.387
His background report
turned up a big ol' red flag

01:17.387 --> 01:19.838
and we need to protect you
and the agency.

01:19.838 --> 01:21.598
He's hiding something, Emma.

01:21.598 --> 01:22.979
We need to find out what.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.402
<i>"May 2013.</i>

01:32.402 --> 01:34.404
<i>"Passport stamped
in Nicaragua.</i>

01:34.404 --> 01:35.854
<i>Overstayed his visa."</i>

01:35.854 --> 01:37.787
<i>Not a big deal.
- You get to the part</i>

01:37.787 --> 01:40.030
where he pops up
six months later

01:40.030 --> 01:42.447
at the Mexican border on foot?

01:42.447 --> 01:44.311
Eight months in Central America

01:44.311 --> 01:46.623
completely unaccounted
for and...

01:47.693 --> 01:50.317
He needs to account for it.

01:50.317 --> 01:51.559
Hands up.

01:52.077 --> 01:53.768
State your full name.

01:53.768 --> 01:56.323
Charles Francis Nicoletti.

01:56.323 --> 01:58.359
Do you own a bar?

01:58.359 --> 01:59.671
With my family, yeah.

02:00.982 --> 02:03.606
Are you currently
in a committed relationship?

02:03.606 --> 02:04.814
<i>Yes.</i>

02:04.814 --> 02:06.609
See? Not all bad.

02:06.609 --> 02:08.611
<i>Have you ever traveled
out of the country?</i>

02:08.611 --> 02:09.784
<i>Yes.</i>

02:09.784 --> 02:11.269
Do you have
any additional passports

02:11.269 --> 02:12.615
other than the one
issued to you

02:12.615 --> 02:13.892
by the United States?

02:13.892 --> 02:15.169
Have you ever worked
for a foreign government?

02:15.169 --> 02:18.138
Have you ever conspired
against the United States?

02:18.655 --> 02:19.967
<i>I'm a bartender, lady.</i>

02:19.967 --> 02:21.279
The only thing
people ask me for

02:21.279 --> 02:23.004
is another round.

02:24.074 --> 02:26.560
Did you know Emma Hill
is a CIA officer?

02:34.188 --> 02:36.949
Did you know Emma Hill
is a CIA officer?

02:38.330 --> 02:40.332
I do now.

02:40.850 --> 02:43.024
<i>Are you upset
she didn't tell you?</i>

02:44.060 --> 02:46.096
<i>I'm sure she had
her reasons.</i>

02:51.412 --> 02:53.794
Have you been
to Central America?

02:56.693 --> 02:58.799
This is about Nicaragua?

03:01.698 --> 03:02.941
Yes or no?

03:08.084 --> 03:11.777
<i>Yeah, um, in 2013.</i>

03:11.777 --> 03:13.917
<i>Why did you overstay
your visa?</i>

03:19.060 --> 03:20.786
<i>I was in prison.</i>

03:23.237 --> 03:25.964
<i>I was with some friends.
We got into a fight.</i>

03:26.792 --> 03:28.277
<i>I punched a military official.</i>

03:28.277 --> 03:31.072
<i>Landed me in Nicaraguan jail
for about seven months.</i>

03:32.177 --> 03:35.111
<i>Wasn't my best moment.</i>

03:36.008 --> 03:38.977
<i>Why didn't you tell
Ms. Hill about this incident?</i>

03:41.566 --> 03:44.327
I didn't want her
to think less of me.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.125
Now you know his secret.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.301
Yeah.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.926
<i>Just wonder
how he'll feel about mine.</i>

04:07.419 --> 04:08.731
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

04:08.731 --> 04:10.388
I--it's protocol.

04:10.388 --> 04:12.252
You have to declare
you're in a relationship,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.081
and then this red flag came up.

04:14.081 --> 04:16.739
And-and I figured there was
a simple explanation.

04:16.739 --> 04:19.086
This is not the way
that I wanted you to find out.

04:19.086 --> 04:20.674
I didn't know
they were going to do that.

04:20.674 --> 04:22.434
I swear.

04:23.470 --> 04:24.919
I'm so sorry.

04:28.854 --> 04:30.960
Charlie?

04:33.065 --> 04:34.964
Charlie?

04:34.964 --> 04:36.931
Charlie, are you okay?

04:36.931 --> 04:38.347
Yeah.

04:39.624 --> 04:41.488
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

04:41.488 --> 04:45.630
just processing.
It's kind of a lot.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.148
I know.

04:48.046 --> 04:50.428
The good news is
you're cleared.

04:50.428 --> 04:54.294
You know my secret,
and now I know yours.

04:55.985 --> 04:58.608
The whole prison thing,
I mean, look,

04:58.608 --> 05:01.335
just because you made
one mistake in Nicaragua

05:01.335 --> 05:04.165
doesn't make you a bad guy.

05:04.165 --> 05:06.098
Right.

05:08.653 --> 05:11.138
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

05:11.138 --> 05:13.174
Yeah, of course.
No, we're good.

05:14.831 --> 05:17.040
We're good.

05:23.219 --> 05:25.808
One, two, three, four
on the vodka...

05:25.808 --> 05:27.327
Hey, there he is.
Where ya been?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.502
Where were you?
You were MIA for 12 hours.

05:30.502 --> 05:32.815
You didn't respond
to our calls or texts.

05:32.815 --> 05:34.817
Yeah. I was with Emma.

05:34.817 --> 05:36.197
Okay, well, let us know

05:36.197 --> 05:37.578
if you're gonna be
out all night.

05:37.578 --> 05:39.649
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize at 40

05:39.649 --> 05:41.341
that I need permission.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.170
So next time I'll make sure
to run right home

05:43.170 --> 05:44.689
the second the streetlights
come on, okay?

05:44.689 --> 05:45.690
Hey, easy, easy, easy, easy.

05:45.690 --> 05:47.692
We-we found your bike
with the keys in it,

05:47.692 --> 05:49.832
and the lights were on.
We just--we got worried.

05:49.832 --> 05:50.867
The Maguires are breathin'

05:50.867 --> 05:52.524
down our n--'kay.
- Yeah, I get it.

05:52.524 --> 05:55.113
- Charlie...
- Hey, I-I get it.

05:58.530 --> 06:02.223
Look, I'm just--I'm tired.
I wanna go shower.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.261
I'm sorry I worried you.

06:05.261 --> 06:07.884
- I was worried.
- Yeah. Okay.

06:16.962 --> 06:19.689
Is everything okay in there?

06:19.689 --> 06:21.415
Yeah.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.384
I'm working on my, uh,
invite list for the fundraiser.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.800
Should I put you down
for plus one?

06:26.800 --> 06:29.250
You can't keep your mystery man
a mystery forever.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.045
I know. But, um...

06:31.045 --> 06:32.530
now's just not the right time.

06:32.530 --> 06:34.635
Come on.
There's no such thing.

06:34.635 --> 06:36.879
Plus, Mom and Dad'll be
on their best behavior,

06:36.879 --> 06:38.121
plenty of buffers.

06:38.121 --> 06:41.021
Best possible scenario
for what's his name again?

06:41.918 --> 06:44.714
- Charlie.
- Who's Charlie?

06:44.714 --> 06:47.717
You're welcome.
Uh, Emma's new boyfriend.

06:47.717 --> 06:49.719
I was telling her she should
bring him to the party.

06:49.719 --> 06:51.963
Uh, event. But yes.

06:51.963 --> 06:54.931
We'd love to meet the man
you've told us nothing about.

06:54.931 --> 06:57.486
Seriously, bring him by.
- I'll ask.

06:57.486 --> 06:59.349
But no promises.

06:59.349 --> 07:01.248
The new polling numbers
look strong.

07:01.248 --> 07:02.801
Donations are through the roof.

07:02.801 --> 07:04.424
I think we can officially say

07:04.424 --> 07:06.115
the campaign
has turned a corner.

07:06.115 --> 07:08.082
I'm proud of you, son.

07:08.082 --> 07:10.430
So who do we have here?

07:11.603 --> 07:12.949
Claire Fox?

07:13.640 --> 07:17.091
Uh, Doug put together
the list.

07:17.091 --> 07:19.404
Half these donors
I don't even know.

07:20.060 --> 07:22.649
Well, trust me when I say

07:22.649 --> 07:25.824
her support
is not the kind you want.

07:25.824 --> 07:28.517
It always comes at a cost.

07:44.325 --> 07:46.362
There she is.

07:48.329 --> 07:50.193
Is he dead?

07:50.193 --> 07:53.162
Aye, he wishes
he was, yeah.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.304
What are you doing here?

07:57.304 --> 07:59.064
I'm cleanin' up your mess.

07:59.064 --> 08:00.721
Why the hell you meetin'
with our rivals?

08:00.721 --> 08:03.793
They're our partners now,
so you need to play nice.

08:03.793 --> 08:06.313
I have got a plan,
and they're a key part of it.

08:06.313 --> 08:08.729
So you had a wee plan,
so you did.

08:10.213 --> 08:11.974
I'm here, so we're doin' things
my way now.

08:11.974 --> 08:14.977
You being here is only gonna
bring us more heat.

08:14.977 --> 08:16.565
The feds
are already watching us.

08:16.565 --> 08:19.395
Your father trusts me
to handle things.

08:19.395 --> 08:22.640
Well, him trustin' you
doesn't mean piss all to me.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.504
And if you think that bein'
the boss' bastard's

08:24.504 --> 08:27.541
gonna get you a seat
at the table, sister...

08:29.094 --> 08:31.131
It won't.

08:38.863 --> 08:40.658
Feelin' better?

08:40.658 --> 08:41.935
I am.

08:41.935 --> 08:43.592
Wanna talk about it?

08:45.870 --> 08:47.285
Okay.

08:48.424 --> 08:50.253
You know, uh,
for what it's worth,

08:50.253 --> 08:53.533
Emma... I didn't hate her.

08:55.155 --> 08:58.192
Oh, my God.
I liked her, okay?

08:58.192 --> 08:59.780
You talkin' Emma?

08:59.780 --> 09:02.680
Everybody loved her.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.785
- No?
- Yeah.

09:04.785 --> 09:07.201
Yeah, no, I--
uh, just, you know--

09:07.201 --> 09:09.790
just it's been a day.

09:11.516 --> 09:13.483
We gotta start lockin'
that door.

09:13.483 --> 09:15.796
- What was that?
- Good morning.

09:18.454 --> 09:20.801
So when do I see
your next payment?

09:21.837 --> 09:23.977
Weren't you just in here
with the same question?

09:23.977 --> 09:26.393
Why the sudden rush?

09:26.393 --> 09:27.705
I think you misunderstand

09:27.705 --> 09:29.638
the parameters
of this relationship.

09:29.638 --> 09:32.572
I need more money,
and I need it now.

09:34.435 --> 09:37.266
Hey, h-how 'bout instead
of us givin' you what we owe

09:37.266 --> 09:39.233
half a million at a time,

09:39.233 --> 09:42.305
what if we $10 million
by the end of the week?

09:42.305 --> 09:43.997
You owe me 14.

09:43.997 --> 09:45.585
I'm negotiating.

09:48.484 --> 09:52.212
10 million.
One shot, and we're done.

09:52.695 --> 09:56.181
Okay, I'll play.
Say I'm interested. How?

09:56.181 --> 09:58.149
It's a yacht thing.

09:58.149 --> 09:59.909
Well, I'm not givin' up
4 million

09:59.909 --> 10:01.117
on "It's a yacht thing."

10:01.117 --> 10:03.430
You care to elaborate?

10:03.430 --> 10:06.295
An underground poker game.
It's got a steep buy-in,

10:06.295 --> 10:07.745
attracts
some of D.C.'s dirtiest.

10:07.745 --> 10:09.539
I'm talkin'
hedge fund managers, lobbyists,

10:09.539 --> 10:11.921
politicians.
- This sounds like a robbery,

10:11.921 --> 10:14.614
not a con.
- It is.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.270
Something in between.

10:20.861 --> 10:22.483
What the hell?

10:22.483 --> 10:26.108
If you can pull it off,
we're square.

10:35.358 --> 10:37.706
Charlie, the Moonshot?

10:37.706 --> 10:39.328
Hold-hold on.

10:39.328 --> 10:41.502
Are we talkin'
about that yacht job

10:41.502 --> 10:43.677
that you two cased
a little while back?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.058
Yeah. It was the one
he canned

10:45.058 --> 10:47.370
because we couldn't figure out
a way to get away clean.

10:47.370 --> 10:50.373
That and, uh, the whole
if they catch us

10:50.373 --> 10:52.513
they kill us
in international waters thing.

10:52.513 --> 10:54.654
We've got the plans.
We-we've got schematics.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.034
I mean,
it's sitting right there.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.485
Charlie, listen, I want
Daphne's overpriced boots

10:58.485 --> 11:00.383
off our necks
as badly as you do,

11:00.383 --> 11:03.870
but we agreed
that this was too dangerous.

11:03.870 --> 11:06.562
Not anymore.

11:08.909 --> 11:10.393
This.

11:21.025 --> 11:25.512
<i>Hey, I just wanted
to say again how sorry I am</i>

11:25.512 --> 11:27.997
<i>for all of it.</i>

11:27.997 --> 11:30.759
<i>And I know
the timing is awkward,</i>

11:30.759 --> 11:33.209
<i>but my brother
is having a fundraiser,</i>

11:33.209 --> 11:36.523
<i>and I was kind of hoping
you'd be my plus one.</i>

11:36.523 --> 11:38.283
<i>Let me know.
And no pressure,</i>

11:38.283 --> 11:40.803
<i>but I'd really love
to see you.</i>

11:44.393 --> 11:46.740
That how this works now?

11:47.948 --> 11:49.743
You call an audible
and expect us

11:49.743 --> 11:53.816
to just, what...
fall in line?

11:54.679 --> 11:56.888
Saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.960
Huh.

12:01.617 --> 12:03.826
What's goin' on, Charlie?

12:07.002 --> 12:09.383
You're a little bitten, huh?

12:09.383 --> 12:11.385
Come on.

12:11.385 --> 12:14.423
Come on, she's got you.
I get it.

12:16.666 --> 12:19.635
She doesn't know
about this side of me, Pop.

12:19.635 --> 12:22.362
What side of you?

12:23.294 --> 12:25.986
You are a stand-up guy.

12:26.987 --> 12:29.231
And stand-up guys
take care of their families.

12:29.231 --> 12:31.578
They do what needs to be done.

12:31.578 --> 12:33.753
I'm not sure
she's gonna see it that way.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.135
I mean, I-I don't even know
if I see it that way anymore.

12:37.135 --> 12:39.897
If this is gonna go anywhere,
me and her,

12:39.897 --> 12:42.658
how long I can get away
with lying to her

12:42.658 --> 12:44.453
has got a clock on it.

12:45.626 --> 12:49.251
I mean, Pop,
this-this may sound crazy,

12:49.251 --> 12:53.496
but I never--I never really
wanted to go straight

12:53.496 --> 12:55.705
until her.

13:00.124 --> 13:03.127
And as long as Daphne
is in our lives...

13:03.127 --> 13:05.301
you can't.

13:06.061 --> 13:08.373
I hear you, son.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.965
Let me see these.

13:19.868 --> 13:22.387
If you're lucky enough
to find someone in your life

13:22.387 --> 13:25.149
that makes you feel
the way she does,

13:25.149 --> 13:27.323
you do not let them go.

13:27.979 --> 13:29.670
You go all in.

13:33.674 --> 13:36.574
We just gotta figure out how.

13:37.195 --> 13:39.542
And I think I got an idea.

13:43.892 --> 13:46.584
And the prodigal son
has returned.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.449
You were right, Hill.

13:50.588 --> 13:52.314
Connor Maguire is stateside?

13:52.314 --> 13:54.385
Got a hit
on one of his aliases

13:54.385 --> 13:56.594
comin' through customs.

13:56.594 --> 13:57.871
He must be here meeting up

13:57.871 --> 14:00.667
with whoever's behind
Daphne's new revenue stream.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.842
- Mm.
- If we identify them...

14:04.602 --> 14:07.053
we can figure out
her next move.

14:11.264 --> 14:12.852
Peace offering.

14:14.784 --> 14:16.648
Well, I prefer tequila.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.756
You know, if we wanna expand
this operation,

14:20.756 --> 14:22.758
we're gonna have
to work together.

14:22.758 --> 14:25.450
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

14:25.450 --> 14:26.866
You tryin' to prove
to the old man

14:26.866 --> 14:29.730
that you're good enough, eh?

14:29.730 --> 14:31.871
Since your ma clearly wasn't.

14:35.391 --> 14:37.911
You know, it's pathetic, really,

14:37.911 --> 14:40.914
you seekin' out
the man who abandoned you.

14:42.053 --> 14:43.606
He came to me.

14:44.849 --> 14:47.576
He showed up
at my mother's funeral.

14:48.473 --> 14:50.199
I didn't plan
on working for him.

14:50.199 --> 14:52.374
But the more I got to know him
and the business,

14:52.374 --> 14:53.616
the more I saw the potential

14:53.616 --> 14:55.895
of what this organization
could be.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.553
And what's that?

14:59.553 --> 15:00.796
We could do for our business

15:00.796 --> 15:02.729
what Bezos did
for selling books.

15:02.729 --> 15:05.042
Oh, yeah.
Oh, great. Right.

15:05.042 --> 15:07.147
So how do you plan
on doin' that, Ivy League?

15:08.079 --> 15:09.909
We unite
all the street-level operations

15:09.909 --> 15:13.567
by making them dependent on us
for distribution.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.569
We sell at a loss,

15:15.569 --> 15:16.950
undercut the competition.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.263
And once our rivals are weak,

15:19.263 --> 15:22.231
dependent on us instead of
the Mexican cartels--

15:22.231 --> 15:25.303
instead of building
our own network here,

15:25.303 --> 15:27.650
we steal theirs.

15:27.650 --> 15:30.653
Lost leader strategy.

15:34.554 --> 15:36.694
I'm not the enemy here, Connor.

15:36.694 --> 15:40.249
There's room for both of us
in this organization.

15:40.249 --> 15:45.013
With your managerial instincts
and my business acumen...

15:45.737 --> 15:48.188
We could make
a lot of money together.

15:52.779 --> 15:56.162
Now, you see...

15:56.162 --> 15:58.026
I like money.

16:03.238 --> 16:06.655
But there's just one thing
I need to know.

16:06.655 --> 16:09.899
If you're sellin' at a loss...

16:09.899 --> 16:12.143
how do you make
the money right?

16:12.143 --> 16:13.834
Hmm.

16:15.043 --> 16:18.149
Well, what can I say, Connor?

16:20.082 --> 16:21.877
I'm resourceful.

16:24.328 --> 16:26.986
Look, I shouldn't have gone
rogue back there with Daphne.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.746
But the pace we're moving,

16:28.746 --> 16:30.299
sooner or later,
it's gonna bite us in the ass.

16:30.299 --> 16:32.715
And you think
one giant score is safer?

16:32.715 --> 16:34.027
We walked away
from the Moonshot

16:34.027 --> 16:36.581
for good reason.
- I think Pop and I figured out

16:36.581 --> 16:38.549
how to get us out alive.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.861
Uh, you're in on this now?

16:40.861 --> 16:43.554
Can someone
please clue me in?

16:45.073 --> 16:47.040
Robert Renway.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.318
Owns one of the biggest
private security firms

16:49.318 --> 16:51.148
this side of the Atlantic.

16:51.148 --> 16:52.252
Claims legitimacy,

16:52.252 --> 16:54.358
but he just hires mercs
for the highest bidder.

16:54.358 --> 16:55.497
Now, once a month,

16:55.497 --> 16:56.843
he's got
a high-stakes poker game

16:56.843 --> 16:58.155
on his private yacht.

16:58.155 --> 17:00.019
It's his way of networking
with the major players

17:00.019 --> 17:02.331
on both sides of the law.
The plan was to create

17:02.331 --> 17:04.747
some kind of diversion,
load the cash onto a boat,

17:04.747 --> 17:06.025
and disappear into the night.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.233
But we got hung up
on logistics.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.683
Namely moving
400 pounds of cash

17:09.683 --> 17:11.685
off a boat
in the middle of the ocean

17:11.685 --> 17:13.342
without anybody noticing.

17:13.342 --> 17:14.930
But I think we solved that.

17:14.930 --> 17:17.174
Plus, you two
already have aliases

17:17.174 --> 17:19.969
and security clearances
to get on the boat as caterers.

17:19.969 --> 17:23.421
And Pop has already been vetted
as a dealer in the game.

17:23.421 --> 17:24.767
Thanks to an old friend,

17:24.767 --> 17:26.735
all Georgie has to do
is call in sick.

17:26.735 --> 17:28.081
Okay.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.773
We ran into trouble
getting into the money room.

17:30.773 --> 17:32.603
Do you guys have
a solve for that?

17:32.603 --> 17:34.881
Oh! How about my seasickness?

17:34.881 --> 17:36.641
No. We're not doin'
the seasickness thing, Mom.

17:36.641 --> 17:38.195
- Why?
- Because it almost got us made

17:38.195 --> 17:39.575
on the Delaware job.
Stay focused.

17:39.575 --> 17:40.887
All-all we need is someone

17:40.887 --> 17:43.234
who actually has stakes
in the game.

17:43.234 --> 17:44.649
Who?

17:45.788 --> 17:47.307
<i>Ernesto Ricci.</i>

17:47.307 --> 17:50.138
<i>A gun runner who works
grey market arms deals.</i>

17:50.138 --> 17:53.002
<i>Now, the goal of the pre-game
is two-fold.</i>

17:53.002 --> 17:55.902
One, Ernesto catches
the eye of Renway

17:55.902 --> 17:57.731
and gets invited
to the private game.

17:57.731 --> 18:01.252
And two, we make
our million dollar buy-in

18:01.252 --> 18:02.633
to that game.

18:02.633 --> 18:05.084
And how do we do that?

18:08.432 --> 18:10.158
With our Pastor Earle money?

18:10.158 --> 18:13.402
Guys, that's all the cash
we have left.

18:13.402 --> 18:16.025
Bird, it's gotta be done.

18:16.025 --> 18:17.958
One and-a two.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.133
And-a one, two, ready.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.376
Let's rock.

18:24.586 --> 18:26.450

Load-bearing.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.191
- That's a high denomination.
- These tiny little ones?

18:43.191 --> 18:45.158
- High denomination.
- Really?

18:45.158 --> 18:47.126
<i>Renway's lookin'
for money and connections.</i>

18:47.126 --> 18:50.163
People he can see doin'
business with in the future.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.785
So you gotta win
with enough flare

18:51.785 --> 18:53.062
that he notices.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.616

Oh, looks like Magnum's got
a winner.

19:01.036 --> 19:02.865
What do you think,
he's got enough to beat us?

19:02.865 --> 19:04.660
- I fold.
- Not you.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.006
Not him.

19:06.006 --> 19:08.664
Quit stallin'.
You in or out?

19:09.527 --> 19:12.116
Oh, I'm all in.

19:14.808 --> 19:17.156
And when he takes
a shine to me...

19:17.156 --> 19:19.813
<i>And that's where I step in

19:19.813 --> 19:22.022

please show your cards.

19:30.307 --> 19:33.172
I'm sorry, I didn't know
if this one was good.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.347
Well, it's all right now.

19:36.347 --> 19:37.314
I appreciate you.

I think you played him

19:48.048 --> 19:49.498
more than the game itself,
my man.

19:49.498 --> 19:51.535
Robert Renway.

19:51.535 --> 19:53.088
Oh, I know.

19:53.088 --> 19:55.194
We run in the same circles.
- Yeah, so I hear.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.024
- Mm-hmm.
- How long you in town?

19:58.024 --> 20:00.337
Few days.
Maybe less if I don't find

20:00.337 --> 20:02.270
more action
than these low-rent games.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.893
<i>I'm lookin' for some

20:04.893 --> 20:06.964

Yeah, I hear you.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.796
Nice to meet you, bro.

20:12.556 --> 20:14.213
Nice to meet you.

20:15.835 --> 20:17.112
<i>Well,
look at the bright side.</i>

20:17.112 --> 20:19.356
<i>Least you walk away
with a million bucks.</i>

20:26.466 --> 20:27.778
Hope to see you there.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.067
Hi.

20:44.381 --> 20:45.899
My dad'll be easy.

20:45.899 --> 20:48.143
It's, uh, my mom
you'll have to watch out for.

20:48.143 --> 20:51.836
She's an iron fist
in a velvet glove.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.942
No different
than a polygraph.

20:54.598 --> 20:56.427
Touché.

20:56.427 --> 20:57.877
Emma?

20:58.947 --> 21:01.087
Here we go.

21:01.087 --> 21:03.503
Charlie, I want you
to meet my parents,

21:03.503 --> 21:06.748
Grace and Joe Hill.
- Hi. Charlie Nicoletti.

21:06.748 --> 21:08.301
Nice to finally meet you.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.854
Wonderful home you have here.

21:09.854 --> 21:12.443
Bricks stuck together
by hard work.

21:14.203 --> 21:15.929
So, Charlie, what do you do?

21:15.929 --> 21:19.174
Own a bar with my family
in Baltimore.

21:21.003 --> 21:22.660
Dad's always saying
small business

21:22.660 --> 21:24.800
is the backbone of our country.

21:26.146 --> 21:27.769
Let's get a drink, Charlie.

21:27.769 --> 21:29.702
I have so many questions
for the man

21:29.702 --> 21:31.117
that my daughter
has been hiding.

21:31.117 --> 21:33.015
Mom, if he's not back
in five minutes,

21:33.015 --> 21:34.396
I'm sending help.

21:35.501 --> 21:36.674
She's trying.

21:36.674 --> 21:38.607
Don't be so hard
on your mother.

21:38.607 --> 21:41.161
I know. It's just, um...

21:41.161 --> 21:43.543
this one's different, you know?

21:46.408 --> 21:48.168
Who's that?

21:50.757 --> 21:53.001
Shark in the water.

21:55.624 --> 21:56.970
Here's to you.

21:56.970 --> 21:58.800
Make sure you're focused
on the--

21:58.800 --> 22:01.561
Excuse me.
- Nice to meet you.

22:02.666 --> 22:05.047
Claire Fox is here,
and she wants a word.

22:06.497 --> 22:08.810
Do you know about what?

22:08.810 --> 22:10.225
Nothing's for free, David,

22:10.225 --> 22:12.261
especially Claire Fox's
support.

22:13.953 --> 22:16.645
Senator Hill.
It's been too long.

22:16.645 --> 22:19.579
But I must say,
the whole "Lion in Winter" vibe

22:19.579 --> 22:20.994
really suits you.

22:20.994 --> 22:22.686
Still lobbying
for the evil empire?

22:22.686 --> 22:25.516
Oh, please. Guns and tobacco
are so early aughts.

22:25.516 --> 22:28.830
You know me, I have my hand
in a lot of pots.

22:28.830 --> 22:30.383
What brings you here?

22:30.383 --> 22:32.178
Well, I wanted to get
some face time

22:32.178 --> 22:33.662
with the soon-to-be
junior senator

22:33.662 --> 22:35.181
from Washington state.

22:35.181 --> 22:37.045
You must be so proud.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.875
Couldn't be prouder.

22:44.501 --> 22:47.227
- Another one?
- Please. Thank you.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.402
Ernesto?

22:50.783 --> 22:51.853
Wow.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.510
Now, I just did not peg you
for the kind of guy

22:53.510 --> 22:55.891
that'd be rubbin' elbows
with these K Street yuppies.

22:55.891 --> 22:57.410
I almost didn't recognize you.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.101
Barely recognize myself

22:59.101 --> 23:00.413
in these rags, you know?

23:00.413 --> 23:02.311
But you gotta put
the square suit on

23:02.311 --> 23:04.417
to do business
with these political types.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.039
Quietly, of course.
You understand, right?

23:06.039 --> 23:08.697
Oh, I got ya.

23:08.697 --> 23:09.698
It's always helpful to know

23:09.698 --> 23:11.148
the next generation
of decision-makers.

23:11.148 --> 23:12.701
You know what I mean?
- It is.

23:12.701 --> 23:14.047
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:14.047 --> 23:17.223
- Robert Renway.
- Emma Hill.

23:17.223 --> 23:18.397
How do you two
know each other?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.744
Uh, we don't. We just met.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.987
Talking about how impressed
we are with David

23:22.987 --> 23:25.162
and, uh, the drinks.
- Hmm.

23:25.162 --> 23:28.337
Charlie seems nice,
don't you think?

23:28.337 --> 23:30.616
Emma's practically glowing.

23:30.616 --> 23:34.930
- You like him?
- What's not to like?

23:34.930 --> 23:36.415
He's handsome, smart,

23:36.415 --> 23:37.933
holds his own in this crowd.

23:37.933 --> 23:40.764
Bit too smooth for my taste.

23:40.764 --> 23:43.905
Oh, please. When we met,
you had no shortage

23:43.905 --> 23:46.079
of ambition or charisma either.

23:47.322 --> 23:50.221
You two are more similar
than you think.

23:51.637 --> 23:54.847
Oh, there he is.
Man of the hour.

23:54.847 --> 23:57.263
Miss Fox. We finally meet.

23:57.263 --> 23:59.023
It's a great turnout tonight.

23:59.023 --> 24:00.266
It's amazing
what aligning yourself

24:00.266 --> 24:01.854
with the right people
can accomplish.

24:01.854 --> 24:03.407
Indeed.

24:03.890 --> 24:06.306
Which brings me
to why I'm here.

24:08.067 --> 24:10.310
I wanted to introduce you
to Jennifer West.

24:10.310 --> 24:12.623
She's bright, insightful,

24:12.623 --> 24:15.971
and I think she'd make a great
addition to your campaign.

24:17.732 --> 24:19.147
Oh.

24:19.147 --> 24:21.321
Really, that's fantastic.

24:28.743 --> 24:29.709
Ah, Charlie.

24:29.709 --> 24:32.781
My wife's been singing
your praises.

24:32.781 --> 24:35.508
I'm flattered. I mean,
she obviously has great taste.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.649
You're
good at that, aren't you?

24:39.547 --> 24:42.239
Always knowing
just what to say.

24:45.242 --> 24:46.312
Part of the job.

24:46.312 --> 24:48.625
You know,
just holding conversations.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.212
Right...

24:50.212 --> 24:52.180
as a bartender.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.632
You don't like me very much.

24:55.632 --> 24:58.151
Well, call it
a professional liability,

24:58.151 --> 25:00.637
but I'm wary of anyone

25:00.637 --> 25:02.501
who always has
all the right answers.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.745
Hmm. Well, bartender, politician,

25:05.745 --> 25:09.231
we're all just giving people
what they want, right?

25:10.405 --> 25:12.511
You think we're the same?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.513
I came to this country
with nothing,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.515
worked hard to get where I am.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.587
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want more for her.

25:21.036 --> 25:22.728
So what's your angle here,
Charlie?

25:22.728 --> 25:24.074
Dad.

25:24.868 --> 25:27.595
- It's fine. No, it's fine.
- No, it's not.

25:28.906 --> 25:30.459
Don't you dare judge Charlie.

25:30.459 --> 25:33.221
He has more integrity
than every person here tonight,

25:33.221 --> 25:36.120
apparently including you.
- It's fine. It's fine.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.777
It's fine.

25:40.987 --> 25:43.403
Come on. Let's go.

25:45.233 --> 25:47.028
Grace, it was lovely
to meet you.

25:47.028 --> 25:48.443
I look forward to the memoir.

25:53.068 --> 25:55.484
Stop it.
I can feel your look.

25:55.484 --> 25:57.728
Good.

26:01.732 --> 26:03.182
Hey.

26:04.735 --> 26:09.050
Thank you for having my back.
- Of course.

26:09.050 --> 26:10.396
I don't know
who that was, but--

26:10.396 --> 26:13.088
It's-it's fine.
It's all good.

26:14.642 --> 26:15.953
Go back inside.
I know you've got

26:15.953 --> 26:19.232
people to talk to.
I'll, uh, I'll call you later.

26:19.232 --> 26:20.337
Okay?
- Okay.

26:20.337 --> 26:21.752
Thank you.

26:39.011 --> 26:41.496
See you tomorrow night.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.267
Hi.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.269
Thank you, Mr. Ricci.
Good luck.

26:56.269 --> 26:58.617
- Ernesto.
- Ah.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.101
Not slummin' it anymore,
are we?

27:00.101 --> 27:01.620
Yeah. No more trash bags.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.931
Just streamlined
and razor-sharp tonight.

27:02.931 --> 27:05.347
I like it.
Well, hey, the game's inside.

27:05.347 --> 27:07.280
Make yourself at home.
What's mine is yours.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.179
I'll remember that.

27:09.179 --> 27:10.594
Okay.

27:11.319 --> 27:12.769
Security's gonna be tight.

27:12.769 --> 27:15.841
Remember, these are
Renway's guys. Former mercs.

27:15.841 --> 27:17.601
<i>They're not to be messed with.</i>

27:18.671 --> 27:20.052
<i>Now, he's got a guard
in the money room,</i>

27:20.052 --> 27:23.469
<i>but he also has cameras
feeding into a hard drive</i>

27:23.469 --> 27:25.954
<i>just in case that guard
decides he wants to skim.</i>

27:25.954 --> 27:28.474
Now, those cameras
aren't monitored live, though.

27:28.474 --> 27:29.993
Now, there's
no personal belongings

27:29.993 --> 27:30.959
allowed in the card room,

27:30.959 --> 27:32.305
<i>but that's
how we're gonna sneak in</i>

27:32.305 --> 27:34.307
<i>our Trojan horse.</i>
- Ernesto.

27:34.307 --> 27:35.550
Ah.
<i>And while guard is trying</i>

27:35.550 --> 27:37.725
<i>to figure out how to turn
my phone off...</i>

27:37.725 --> 27:39.485
<i>That's when the phones
will be close enough</i>

27:39.485 --> 27:42.488
<i>for me to hack into his phone
and clone it.</i>

27:42.488 --> 27:44.835
Gentlemen and lady.

27:44.835 --> 27:47.493
You know the rules.
Who's feelin' lucky?

27:47.493 --> 27:49.495
<i>♪ Makes my body
dance for you ♪</i>

27:49.495 --> 27:50.910
<i>♪ Oohe, Makeba...</i>

27:50.910 --> 27:52.153
Bets please.

27:52.153 --> 27:53.361
<i>♪ Makeba ma che bella</i>

27:53.361 --> 27:55.984
<i>♪ Can I get and "oohe,"
Makeba ♪</i>

27:55.984 --> 27:57.330
Cards please.

27:57.330 --> 27:59.091
<i>♪ Oohe, Makeba...</i>

27:59.091 --> 28:00.333
Oh ho ho!

28:00.333 --> 28:02.025
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

28:02.025 --> 28:04.372
Oh, you know, I never heard
that one before?

28:04.372 --> 28:06.029
Gotta get you some new lines, papi.

28:06.029 --> 28:07.996
<i>Once you've cloned the phone,
you gotta find</i>

28:07.996 --> 28:09.032
<i>something we can use quick</i>

28:09.032 --> 28:10.896
<i>to get that guard
out of the money room.</i>

28:10.896 --> 28:14.416
<i>♪ Makeba, makes my body

28:17.040 --> 28:18.351

28:18.351 --> 28:20.457

28:20.457 --> 28:22.286
Whoo. Hell of a river.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.564
Hell of a river.

28:26.049 --> 28:27.567
Call.

28:28.396 --> 28:30.467
Gentlemen, cards.

28:31.123 --> 28:32.711
Bam.

28:37.819 --> 28:40.546
Lady luck can be
a vicious mistress, my friend.

28:40.546 --> 28:43.860
Oh, Go buy a lotto ticket
on your way home, bro.

28:43.860 --> 28:46.794
Je-sus.
This guy is too much.

28:46.794 --> 28:49.486
All right, we playin' cards?
You gonna deal or what?

28:49.486 --> 28:51.488
<i>Bird, once you have
what you need,</i>

28:51.488 --> 28:53.386
<i>Mom'll bring us drinks
just to let us know</i>

28:53.386 --> 28:54.836
<i>it's showtime.</i>

28:56.182 --> 28:57.908
Here is your Scotch, sir.

28:58.806 --> 29:01.878
And another water
for the dealer.

29:01.878 --> 29:03.051
Thanks, Fran.

29:05.605 --> 29:08.401
The name's Julie,
but you are very welcome.

29:08.401 --> 29:09.644
Hey, you guys gonna flirt

29:09.644 --> 29:11.301
or you gonna deal the cards, huh?

29:11.301 --> 29:12.751
Come on. What?

29:16.685 --> 29:18.239
Hey, you know, these cards
are gonna land

29:18.239 --> 29:20.413
somewhere very uncomfortable
for you, my friend,

29:20.413 --> 29:21.898
those ones
don't start shapin' up.

29:21.898 --> 29:23.485
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy.

29:23.485 --> 29:24.797
This is me takin' it easy.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.765
Sir, please.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.681
Yeah, okay.

29:46.992 --> 29:48.372
Call.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.031
Gentlemen, cards.

29:56.656 --> 29:58.555
Ooh.
That's a winner.

29:58.555 --> 30:00.522
Oh, you think
this is funny, huh?

30:00.522 --> 30:02.317
Bozo the clown?

30:02.317 --> 30:03.871
What are you doin'?
You, you smilin'.

30:03.871 --> 30:05.113
You gonna be swimmin'
off a this boat

30:05.113 --> 30:06.874
if you don't wipe the smile
off your face,

30:06.874 --> 30:08.876
you understand? Huh?
- Ernesto, let's take a walk.

30:08.876 --> 30:10.809
No, no, I don't want to walk.
I don't want to walk.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.293
I wanna play,
only this game is fixed.

30:12.293 --> 30:13.363
Hey, there's nothing
fixed here.

30:13.363 --> 30:14.398
Tonight's just not your night, man.

30:14.398 --> 30:17.194
That's it.
Come on. Please. Please.

30:17.194 --> 30:18.609
Let's go talk.

30:18.989 --> 30:20.680
Hey, you know what?
Don't to--you don't touch me.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.992
- Calm down.
- You don't need to do that.

30:21.992 --> 30:23.407
Why don't you take a breather
for a minute?

30:23.407 --> 30:25.306
Nah, I'm cool. I'm cool.
Hey, I'm cool.

30:25.306 --> 30:27.653
- Okay.
- I'm cool. Yeah.

30:27.653 --> 30:29.862
Look, why don't you, uh,
just take a beat?

30:29.862 --> 30:30.863
It's all good.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.416
Game's not goin' anywhere.
- Yeah.

30:32.416 --> 30:34.349
Yeah, no, no.
I'll take a break.

30:34.349 --> 30:36.351
This is me breakin'. Mm-hmm.

31:01.790 --> 31:04.276
Damn it, come on.

31:26.332 --> 31:29.404
- Wow.
- Let's get this done.

31:35.583 --> 31:38.586
- And she is?
- Driver.

31:41.244 --> 31:43.039
So you're not in labor?

31:43.039 --> 31:45.558
So who texted me?

31:45.558 --> 31:46.939
All-all right, uh...

31:46.939 --> 31:49.424
Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.

31:52.427 --> 31:53.601
Time's up.

31:53.601 --> 31:55.499
Two minutes.

31:55.499 --> 31:56.638
Charlie, we gotta go.

31:56.638 --> 31:59.262
You wanna get
out of this or not?

31:59.262 --> 32:01.781
You guys keep loading.
I'll buy us some time.

32:01.781 --> 32:03.438
Go, go, go, go, go.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.063
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

32:07.063 --> 32:09.065
- Excuse me.
- Can you help me just--

32:09.065 --> 32:10.169
Oh, no. Oh. Oh, no.

32:10.169 --> 32:12.689
I'm sorry, can't you help me
get this--

32:12.689 --> 32:15.002
Oh, how rude!

32:26.875 --> 32:28.739
We got a problem.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.207
Let's get you set back up.

32:48.207 --> 32:50.106
Appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

32:50.106 --> 32:53.109
Hey, apologies for before, huh?

32:53.109 --> 32:55.801
- No hard feelings.
- None at all, my friend.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.322
Sir. A word?

33:01.117 --> 33:02.911
What'd I miss?

33:02.911 --> 33:05.052
The money is gone.

33:05.052 --> 33:07.675
What do you mean,
money is gone?

33:07.675 --> 33:09.194
It can't be.

33:09.849 --> 33:11.127
Hey, is it me or does it feel

33:11.127 --> 33:13.646
like somethin'
just hit the fan?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.862
Go, go, go!

33:22.862 --> 33:24.933
Get downstairs. Hurry!

33:27.246 --> 33:28.972
Don't let them get away!

33:30.353 --> 33:32.148
Everyone remain calm.
There's a situation.

33:32.148 --> 33:34.046
We have it under control.
We will get

33:34.046 --> 33:35.737
all your money back, I promise.
- What?

33:35.737 --> 33:37.532
What do you mean
get our money back?

33:37.532 --> 33:39.189
What happened to our money?

33:42.054 --> 33:43.745
Freeze!

33:43.745 --> 33:46.093
Let me see your hands.

33:46.093 --> 33:47.680
Hands up!

33:53.169 --> 33:55.999
Seamus. Sit.

33:58.139 --> 34:00.072
I just wanted to have a chat,
you know?

34:00.072 --> 34:02.626
Just me and you.
Just the boys, you know?

34:05.388 --> 34:07.459
See, I know that Daphne's

34:07.459 --> 34:10.531
been supplementin' her drug
losses with an outside source.

34:10.531 --> 34:13.396
So... who is it?

34:13.396 --> 34:14.949
I don't know.

34:14.949 --> 34:16.226
Uhh--

34:17.331 --> 34:18.953
Try again.

34:18.953 --> 34:21.128
The money's comin' from where?

34:26.650 --> 34:28.204
Impossible, huh?

34:28.204 --> 34:29.653
I said nearly.

34:29.653 --> 34:31.793
Moonshot indeed.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.764
Hey. Our cut
to pay back the buy-in.

34:37.765 --> 34:39.801
Meet Daphne,
and then we're done.

34:47.326 --> 34:49.466
- Hey.
- Yeah.

34:49.466 --> 34:53.091
We gonna talk about
what happened tonight?

34:53.781 --> 34:55.955
You broke cover.

34:56.818 --> 34:58.820
Oh, I just got...

34:58.820 --> 35:01.271
caught up in the moment.
That's all.

35:02.445 --> 35:04.826
We can't pretend
this isn't happening, babe.

35:04.826 --> 35:06.966
We can't just will it away.

35:08.451 --> 35:11.039
- I know that.
- Do you?

35:11.971 --> 35:13.180
I'm good. Okay?

35:13.180 --> 35:16.838
Hey, we just walked off
with $10 million, Frannie.

35:16.838 --> 35:19.358
Come on.
Can't be slippin' that much.

35:29.989 --> 35:32.199
Hey. Thanks for calling.

35:32.199 --> 35:34.201
Connor's in the air
in two hours.

35:34.201 --> 35:36.203
Got a report
that his jet is being fueled

35:36.203 --> 35:39.551
for an international flight,
so the FBI's standing down.

35:39.551 --> 35:42.761
Oh, no, you boys didn't get
to play cops and robbers?

35:45.108 --> 35:47.835
But, seriously,
why come all the way to D.C.

35:47.835 --> 35:50.078
only to turn right back around?

35:50.078 --> 35:52.011
There has to be more to it.

35:52.011 --> 35:54.773
Which is why I figured
we'd follow him to the airport.

35:55.670 --> 35:57.500
You're the best, Vik.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.329
Don't make me blush.

36:12.031 --> 36:13.654
The hell is this?

36:21.109 --> 36:22.732
Damn it.

36:28.634 --> 36:31.361
Out. Now.

36:38.886 --> 36:41.889
And you can take the mask off.
I already know who you are.

36:47.308 --> 36:48.896
There he is.

36:48.896 --> 36:51.726
Ah, well,
you know, when I found out

36:51.726 --> 36:54.902
that Daphne was workin'
with the man who ripped me off,

36:54.902 --> 36:56.973
kick in the balls
that felt like, you know?

36:56.973 --> 36:59.251
Oh, no. But it kept
your pockets fat, didn't it?

36:59.251 --> 37:00.908
Oh, yeah.

37:02.081 --> 37:04.152
Very well now, yeah.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.543
That covers the deal
Daphne and I had.

37:15.543 --> 37:17.476
You and me, we're done.

37:17.476 --> 37:19.098
Oh, yeah.

37:21.998 --> 37:24.242
Never truer words spoken, son.

37:32.595 --> 37:33.803
There it is.

37:33.803 --> 37:35.943
That's Daphne's
secret revenue stream.

37:38.221 --> 37:40.154
What are you doing?
- My job.

37:40.154 --> 37:41.914
This is enough
to put Connor away.

37:41.914 --> 37:44.434
Arresting Connor
is a short-term win.

37:44.434 --> 37:46.056
Think bigger picture.

37:52.442 --> 37:55.445
You know, I wonder
what your father's gonna say,

37:55.445 --> 37:57.792
you steppin' in
on your sister's business.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.207
I mean, I'm guessing
you're gonna keep

37:59.207 --> 38:01.313
all this for yourself, right?

38:01.313 --> 38:03.142
I mean,
it's just kind of obvious

38:03.142 --> 38:05.110
he never really trusted you
to run things,

38:05.110 --> 38:07.215
so he brings his daughter in,

38:07.215 --> 38:09.528
has her step up
where you couldn't, right?

38:10.322 --> 38:13.187
Does your mouth
ever stop movin', son?

38:13.187 --> 38:15.603
Let me ask you, Connor,
you know that saying,

38:15.603 --> 38:18.537
"Every king has an heir
and a spare"?

38:20.677 --> 38:21.954
Which one am I lookin' at?

38:30.963 --> 38:33.311
Looks like we got a tail.

38:40.283 --> 38:43.182
Well, until next time, eh?

38:44.391 --> 38:45.530
Yeah.

38:48.395 --> 38:50.051
Damn it!

38:59.026 --> 39:01.304
Okay, here they come.

39:14.075 --> 39:15.836
Workin' with a man
who ripped us off?

39:15.836 --> 39:18.459
<i>Is that what they taught you
in business school, huh?</i>

39:19.598 --> 39:22.739
You know, I'm not sure
how Daddy's gonna feel

39:22.739 --> 39:25.363
about how you've been runnin'
things with him away.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.020
Connor, I thought we had
an understanding.

39:28.020 --> 39:29.746
Well, then you're a fool.

39:29.746 --> 39:31.403
But thanks for the 10 mill.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.681
You're not just screwing
me over here.

39:33.681 --> 39:35.200
This is our family's business.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.684
<i>You're not part
of this family.</i>

39:36.684 --> 39:38.030
<i>You never have been.</i>

39:38.030 --> 39:40.101
And, now, the only friend
that you have left

39:40.101 --> 39:43.035
is just some two-bit shyster.

39:43.035 --> 39:45.037
<i>And I'm sure
he's gonna find a way</i>

39:45.037 --> 39:46.694
<i>to make another 10 mill.</i>

39:46.694 --> 39:49.283
So in the meantime...

39:49.283 --> 39:51.906
you want what's mine, sister?

39:53.977 --> 39:55.910
Come and get it.

40:01.916 --> 40:03.780
And he just took it.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.989
I'm lucky he didn't kill me.

40:05.989 --> 40:08.923
But, I mean, that's...

40:08.923 --> 40:10.062
not the end of it.

40:10.062 --> 40:12.306
I might...

40:12.306 --> 40:14.377
I mighta gotten made.

40:17.380 --> 40:19.934
- By who?
- Feds.

40:19.934 --> 40:21.626
Oh, Jesus.

40:21.626 --> 40:24.007
Uh, I think
they were followin' Connor.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.664
They saw your face?

40:26.493 --> 40:29.081
No. No, I had the mask down.

40:29.081 --> 40:31.636
So how would they make you?

40:31.636 --> 40:34.259
Just a feeling.

40:34.259 --> 40:36.951
You know, just a bad feeling.

40:38.539 --> 40:40.921
You're probably
just being paranoid.

40:40.921 --> 40:42.370
Hey, come on, guys.
- Yeah.

40:42.370 --> 40:45.339
We did it.
It was a clean score.

40:45.339 --> 40:48.100
We're all in one piece.
We should feel good about this.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.481
Let's not panic

40:49.481 --> 40:51.863
until we have
a reason to panic, all right?

40:51.863 --> 40:54.072
All right?
- Yeah. Thanks, Pop.

41:33.698 --> 41:35.423
Everything good?

41:35.907 --> 41:40.083
Well, you know that case
I was telling you about?

41:44.605 --> 41:48.057
I think I finally
caught a lead.

41:49.437 --> 41:51.474
Well, that's great.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.511
Mm-hmm.

42:03.693 --> 42:04.660
You okay?

42:04.660 --> 42:08.664
I know this week
was a lot, but...

42:08.664 --> 42:10.458
I think this is worth it.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.566
I think so too.
