00:19.486 --> 00:20.783
Sorry!

00:20.854 --> 00:23.721
Obviously, Ensign Baytart
doesn't appreciate music.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.883
lt's the darn fluid conduits
running through the walls.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.119
They conduct sound.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.922
You think when they designed
this thing, they would've...

00:28.995 --> 00:31.725
The ship was built
for combat performance, Harry,

00:31.798 --> 00:32.787
not musical performance.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.835
Nobody figured
we'd be taking any long trips.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.995
Where am l supposed to practice?

00:38.071 --> 00:39.663
How about cargo bay?

00:39.739 --> 00:41.639
Bad acoustics.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.472
We could get Baytart transferred
to the night shift.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.873
Couldn't do that.

00:47.947 --> 00:48.971
Could we?

00:50.216 --> 00:52.047
So now you have an excuse
to give your mother

00:52.152 --> 00:54.086
why you didn't practice
while you were gone.

00:56.089 --> 01:00.025
Look, l'm trying to prepare
for an important performance.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.027
Oh, really?

01:01.094 --> 01:02.356
Are we scheduled to rendezvous

01:02.429 --> 01:04.294
with the Delta Quadrant
Symphony Orchestra?

01:04.364 --> 01:07.527
No. Susan Nicoletti and l
have been working on

01:07.600 --> 01:09.591
a new orchestral program
for the holodeck.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.933
Lieutenant Nicoletti?

01:12.005 --> 01:14.974
The one l've been chasing
for six months?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.474
Cold hands, cold heart?

01:16.543 --> 01:18.738
Not when she plays the oboe.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.576
Chakotay to all senior officers.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.809
Please report to the Bridge.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.510
You know, Harry,

01:25.585 --> 01:28.179
l've always wanted to learn
how to play the drums.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.698
l am picking up communication
satellites in orbit.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.236
They're nonfunctional.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.238
Mr. Paris, take us
in a little closer.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.398
Mr. Kim, scan the surface.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.577
Captain, this used to be
a major trading spot.

01:55.648 --> 01:56.774
How long ago?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.340
l'm not sure exactly.

01:58.418 --> 01:59.885
lf l had to guess...

01:59.953 --> 02:01.318
EM signature indicates

02:01.387 --> 02:04.413
that a major solar flare
occurred here 19 years ago.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.585
l'd say about 19 years...

02:07.660 --> 02:08.592
more or less.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.129
Looks like a glacial freeze.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.164
Caused by a solar flare

02:12.232 --> 02:14.166
that radically changed
the weather patterns.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.065
lt did a lot more than that.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.435
They were hit by magnetic storms
and extreme levels of radiation.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.371
Those glaciers are receding.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.875
The biosphere seems
to be recovering.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.740
Did anyone survive?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.643
l'm scanning the settlement.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.511
There's evidence
of advanced technology--

02:29.582 --> 02:31.880
warp reactors,
subspace transmitters--

02:31.951 --> 02:34.181
but no life signs.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.553
Maybe they saw it coming
and evacuated the planet.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.956
lndications are that any attempt
at an evacuation

02:40.026 --> 02:42.654
would have been prevented
by the atmospheric disturbances.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.664
What was
the estimated population?

02:45.732 --> 02:47.962
Approximately 400,000.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.001
Captain.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.593
l'm picking up something
from the surface.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.735
l think we're being hailed.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.152
l thought you said
there weren't any life signs.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.281
There aren't.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.791
l scanned the entire surface.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.294
Must be an automated signal.

04:56.362 --> 04:57.989
Let's hear it.

04:58.064 --> 05:02.330
l am Viorsa,
planner for the Kohl settlement.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.098
Your sensors have activated
this message.

05:05.171 --> 05:08.800
By now, you must be aware
of the catastrophic disaster

05:08.875 --> 05:10.968
that has destroyed our home.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.672
A few of us
have managed to survive

05:13.746 --> 05:16.340
in a state
of artificial hibernation,

05:16.416 --> 05:21.012
programmed to end in 15 years
from the date this was recorded.

05:21.087 --> 05:24.284
At that time,
when the eco recovery has begun,

05:24.357 --> 05:28.088
we will attempt
to rebuild our settlement.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.359
Please do nothing
to interrupt our timetable.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.563
Their timetable was supposed
to end four years ago.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.831
Looks like they didn't make it.

05:38.905 --> 05:42.272
Mr. Kim, wouldn't your scans
have picked up

05:42.342 --> 05:44.105
suppressed metabolic activity?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.804
l would think so, Captain.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.345
Unless...

05:49.782 --> 05:51.249
Checking below the surface.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.751
Nothing one kilometer down.

05:53.820 --> 05:54.809
Two kilometers...

05:55.855 --> 05:57.322
Wait a minute.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.857
l think l've got something.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.691
2.3 kilometers down--
extremely faint bio-signatures.

06:02.762 --> 06:03.990
Three humanoids.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.293
Can you detect a malfunction
in their systems?

06:06.366 --> 06:09.028
Something to explain why they
didn't wake up on schedule?

06:09.102 --> 06:10.626
Not at this distance.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.864
But l am picking up
two more humanoids

06:12.939 --> 06:14.907
at the same location
who are dead.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.034
Are there any
automated security systems?

06:18.111 --> 06:19.908
We triggered
a ''do not disturb'' sign.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.674
l don't want
to set off anything worse.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.511
No weapons of any kind, Captain.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.484
lt is safe to transport
the hibernation pods to Voyager,

06:26.552 --> 06:27.883
if that is your intent.

06:27.954 --> 06:28.886
lt is.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.923
Prepare to beam them
to Cargo Bay 1.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.217
Mr. Kim, you're with me.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.156
Janeway to Kes,
report to Cargo Bay 1.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.387
Bring your medical gear.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.792
Aye, Captain.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.505
Two humanoids dead.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.508
Three humanoids in deep stasis.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.238
Life signs apparently stable.

07:00.453 --> 07:01.886
Our messenger.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.496
Did the system break down?

07:15.568 --> 07:18.503
Not that l can see.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.505
l'm not reading
any pathway failures

07:20.573 --> 07:21.938
in the hibernation pods.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.303
The circuitry all seems
to be functioning.

07:31.317 --> 07:33.785
lt looks like their brains
are interconnected

07:33.853 --> 07:37.812
in a complex sensory system
controlled by this computer.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.462
According to these indicators,
Captain,

07:44.530 --> 07:45.690
their minds are active.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.357
Active?
What do you mean?

07:47.433 --> 07:50.664
The encephalographic reading
suggests they're dreaming,

07:50.736 --> 07:53.466
but there's some kind of
interactivity with the computer.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.871
lt's not just scanning
their brain functions.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.467
lt's sending a data stream
back to them, as well.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.536
Could it be generating

08:01.581 --> 08:04.243
an artificial environment
of some sort?

08:04.283 --> 08:06.183
Artificial environment?

08:06.252 --> 08:10.814
Years ago, Starfleet
used a technology

08:10.890 --> 08:14.849
to assist deep space travel
that kept the body in stasis,

08:14.927 --> 08:17.395
but provided a mental landscape

08:17.463 --> 08:19.863
to keep the mind
active and alert.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.433
That sounds like
a pretty good way

08:21.501 --> 08:22.866
to wait out
a planetary disaster.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.234
For the moment,
it's as good a theory as any.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.136
So, what went wrong?

08:28.207 --> 08:30.539
Why are they still in there?

08:30.610 --> 08:31.907
The system was supposed

08:31.978 --> 08:33.912
to bring these people
out of hibernation

08:33.980 --> 08:35.572
four years ago.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.174
However, it wasn't left
entirely to the computer.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.447
The programmers
obviously wanted

08:41.520 --> 08:43.614
the people in the system
to decide for themselves

08:43.688 --> 08:45.680
when it would be safe
to come out.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.589
This was accomplished
by a subroutine

08:47.660 --> 08:50.720
that periodically displayed
atmospheric conditions to them.

08:50.796 --> 08:51.888
So, they should've known
years ago

08:51.964 --> 08:53.056
that the biosphere
had recovered.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.429
Exactly.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.731
This subroutine has remained
available to these people

08:57.803 --> 08:59.998
since it was activated
four years ago.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.937
lt's literally an escape hatch.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.407
Perhaps it has malfunctioned.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.843
No. That's what's so odd
about this.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.040
As far as l can tell,
it's working perfectly.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.777
Then why don't they
get themselves out?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.045
l don't know.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.245
Maybe they like it in there.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.844
l don't think so.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.184
Doctor?

09:17.256 --> 09:19.850
The two victims died
from massive heart failure

09:19.959 --> 09:22.689
and there was evidence
of prior neural trauma.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.730
l'm sorry.
What does that mean?

09:24.797 --> 09:28.198
lt could be evidence
of extreme... fear.

09:28.267 --> 09:32.260
Maybe it was caused by the panic
that accompanies a heart attack.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.670
The readings suggest an extended
period of mental stress.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.674
Sounds like we ought
to get them out right away.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.505
Surely, Commander,
you're not suggesting

09:38.578 --> 09:40.512
we simply unplug them?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.138
Why not?

09:42.214 --> 09:44.307
Because you have three brains
whose survival

09:44.383 --> 09:47.079
has depended upon careful
monitoring by a sophisticated

09:47.153 --> 09:49.178
computer system for 19 years.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.483
The Doc is right.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.524
l have no idea
how to disconnect them

09:52.592 --> 09:54.253
without causing neural damage.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.057
l just don't know
the system well enough.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.687
They know the system.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.925
Why don't we ask them
how to proceed?

10:01.033 --> 10:02.830
How can we do that?

10:02.902 --> 10:05.063
lmplant a com-link
into their brains?

10:05.137 --> 10:07.264
We already have a means
of communication--

10:07.340 --> 10:08.739
the two unoccupied pods.

10:08.808 --> 10:12.767
We could add a backup
life support system,

10:12.845 --> 10:15.143
using our own computer
and medical stasis technology.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.478
The only way to help
those people is to go in

10:17.550 --> 10:19.381
and find out from them
what's wrong.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.420
l don't see any alternative.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.853
Neither do l.

10:25.925 --> 10:26.857
l'll be monitoring

10:26.926 --> 10:28.416
your mental
and physical functions.

10:28.494 --> 10:31.691
lf we detect
any unusual activity,

10:31.764 --> 10:33.789
you'll be transferred
onto our life support system

10:33.866 --> 10:35.333
and resuscitated.

10:35.401 --> 10:38.393
We've tapped into the system's
recall subroutine program.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.132
l'll give you five minutes
to look around,

10:40.206 --> 10:41.298
then l'm bringing you back.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.001
Consider this a test run.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.235
Understood.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.944
lnducing primary stasis.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.229
Autonomic nervous system link
is secure.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.203
They're connecting
to the system.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.973
Looks like we made it.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.475
How do you feel?

11:21.313 --> 11:23.178
Normal.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.766
These must be characters
generated by the computer,

11:48.841 --> 11:50.809
but l don't see our people.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.275
Neither do l.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.207
Uh, excuse me.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.245
We're trying to find
some friends.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.416
Well, that shouldn't
be difficult.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.123
We're all friends here.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.840
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-Oh, l'm sorry.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.436
l didn't mean to bump into you.

12:28.514 --> 12:29.606
You're new.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.843
Yes, we are.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.817
Where are you from?

12:33.886 --> 12:35.217
Another town.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.048
There aren't any other towns.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.191
We're not getting very far.

12:47.299 --> 12:49.859
Perhaps l can help you.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.329
You are looking for friends?

12:54.406 --> 12:55.998
That's right, three of them.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.009
And when you find
these friends...?

12:59.078 --> 13:00.602
We want to talk to them.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.409
Why talk when we can dance?

13:25.037 --> 13:26.129
Let's get out of here.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.172
You got it.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.572
You!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.973
Take him.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.541
Harry.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.918
Harry!

13:49.695 --> 13:51.356
Harry!

13:57.303 --> 13:58.395
Harry!

14:13.085 --> 14:14.382
Stop!

14:16.355 --> 14:17.754
They're aliens!

14:17.823 --> 14:19.688
And they won't be alone.

14:19.758 --> 14:23.558
Kill them, and their shipmates
will shut down the program.

14:24.563 --> 14:25.552
Let him go!

14:27.633 --> 14:30.932
We knew this would happen
someday-- that a ship

14:31.036 --> 14:32.298
would find us.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.362
lt was only a matter of time.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.034
Only a matter of time, yes.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.737
Who knows what kind
of people they are?

14:39.812 --> 14:44.511
Who knows what will happen
to this world if you hurt them?

14:44.583 --> 14:46.175
l do.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.379
l know.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.978
Bring them here!

14:50.055 --> 14:52.353
Bring them here,
bring them here.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.459
You're like me.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.189
A little of this
and a little of that.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.693
Ooh! My, what a temper.

15:03.769 --> 15:06.067
That's from your mother's side,
isn't it?

15:06.138 --> 15:09.039
Yes. You see?
l know everything.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.008
This is my world,

15:11.076 --> 15:12.475
my festival,

15:12.544 --> 15:14.478
and you're here
without an invitation.

15:14.546 --> 15:15.535
What is going on?

15:15.614 --> 15:16.638
Who is he?

15:16.715 --> 15:18.774
You will talk to me.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.443
l speak for them.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.578
And l speak for you, now.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.520
You don't understand that yet.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.251
You don't accept it...

15:26.325 --> 15:27.417
but you will.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.393
Are you a life-form

15:29.461 --> 15:33.192
or some kind of computer virus
that penetrated this system?

15:36.702 --> 15:38.033
A virus, a virus

15:38.103 --> 15:39.695
He thinks l am a virus

15:39.772 --> 15:41.865
He thinks
l am a virus.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.672
Well, perhaps
l'll be a virus today.

15:46.078 --> 15:50.139
Oh, this one's got a mind
full of technical

15:50.215 --> 15:52.547
and operational
thoughts and ideas.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.586
Harry knows viruses.

15:54.653 --> 15:55.950
Stop this.

16:02.995 --> 16:07.193
l know you came here to get them
and take them away.

16:07.266 --> 16:10.292
But if you do that,

16:10.369 --> 16:11.961
we'll all disappear.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.200
Disappear.

16:16.275 --> 16:19.870
Because you're characters
created by this program.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.210
And once their minds stop
interacting with the system,

16:23.282 --> 16:25.375
you won't exist anymore.

16:25.451 --> 16:28.579
Ah, see the technical mind
at work.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.181
lt seeks diagnostics,
data analysis.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.248
Well, here's some more data
for your mind

16:34.326 --> 16:35.850
to analyze and diagnose, Harry.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.590
Yes, l am merely
what has been created

16:38.664 --> 16:40.564
and is being created

16:40.632 --> 16:42.099
by his brain,

16:42.167 --> 16:47.469
his brain, her brain, and now...

16:47.539 --> 16:50.167
yours, and yours.

16:54.013 --> 16:54.980
Wha...?

16:58.217 --> 16:59.946
What's this doing here now?

17:00.986 --> 17:02.010
This is your work.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.418
That's our wake-up call.

17:03.489 --> 17:06.753
lt's been a real pleasure,
but... we're leaving.

17:06.825 --> 17:07.916
Come on.

17:09.728 --> 17:12.252
lf you leave,
one of them will die.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.195
One of them will die.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.358
Try it and see.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.196
lf you leave...

17:17.269 --> 17:18.201
he dies.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.362
He can do it.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.872
He's already killed
two of our colleagues.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.497
How is that possible?

17:23.575 --> 17:24.872
l cut off their heads.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.534
But none of this is real.

17:26.612 --> 17:27.909
Of course it's real.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.537
As real as a nightmare.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.139
The two we found dead,

17:31.216 --> 17:33.741
both suffered
from massive heart attacks.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.309
Heart attack.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.151
Now, what might cause
a heart attack? Hmm.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.282
Unmanageable stress, perhaps?

17:40.359 --> 17:42.350
Unmanageable fear?

17:42.428 --> 17:44.623
The fear of losing a head,
perhaps?!

17:47.466 --> 17:49.559
You scared them to death.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.265
What's taking them so long?

17:57.342 --> 17:58.309
Life signs are stable.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.208
There's no interruption
in brain wave activity.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.213
The recall subroutine
is functioning.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.340
The window opened
for them on schedule.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.112
Captain, the norepinephrine
levels are rising.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.949
They're well above baseline.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.454
Some of that is to be expected,

18:10.522 --> 18:12.513
but these levels indicate
abnormal stress.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.456
All right.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.790
l'm going to try to bring them
out with our backup systems.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.523
lnitiating resuscitation.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.566
The body temperature is rising.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.230
What happened?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.874
Their bodies are returning
to stasis condition, Captain.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.846
Someone is terminating
the recall command

18:35.914 --> 18:37.609
from inside the system.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.918
Very wise of you,
my technically minded fellow.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.456
Now, get rid of it completely.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.492
lt's an intrusion.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.821
lt's ruining the party.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.725
That would be a mistake.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.026
No mistake.
A mistake if you refuse.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.793
You'd be missing an opportunity.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.294
Trying to get the better of me?

18:57.369 --> 18:59.098
Trying to trick me?

18:59.171 --> 19:01.537
l know everything you know,
Harry Kim.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.335
l know how much you miss Libby.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.343
l know how you can never hit
that G-sharp

19:05.410 --> 19:06.934
in the Mozart concerto.

19:07.012 --> 19:09.708
Do you think l don't know
you're trying to defeat me?

19:09.781 --> 19:12.477
Fine. So you know.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.782
You'll also know that what l'm
about to tell you is the truth.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.220
You'd be smart
to let one of us go.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.848
Would l?

19:19.925 --> 19:22.655
This is your chance to send
the outside world a message--

19:22.728 --> 19:24.628
to tell them your demands.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.425
l have only one demand--

19:26.498 --> 19:27.726
to exist.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.131
Then you'd better let us
tell them.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.134
Otherwise, you run the risk

19:31.203 --> 19:32.693
of our people
shutting down the whole system,

19:32.771 --> 19:34.033
because l promise you,

19:34.106 --> 19:36.540
they won't let us stay
in here for long.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.216
How did this happen?

19:47.286 --> 19:49.481
The system was designed
to be adaptive,

19:49.555 --> 19:51.682
to observe and respond
to our thoughts

19:51.757 --> 19:54.123
and adjust the environment
to our wishes.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.355
Who wished him up?

19:56.428 --> 19:59.363
lt happened over months
without our even realizing it.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.831
All of us had fears
about survival, recovery.

20:01.900 --> 20:02.924
We never anticipated

20:03.001 --> 20:05.265
the computer would manifest
those fears into him.

20:05.337 --> 20:07.237
Our only hope was
that someone like you

20:07.306 --> 20:08.773
would come along and find us.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.308
lt's almost as though
he can read our minds.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.934
He seems to know
what we're thinking.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.569
He's generated by the system,

20:14.646 --> 20:16.841
and our brains are monitored
by the system,

20:16.915 --> 20:18.974
so, yes, in a manner
of speaking, he can.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.643
But there is a delay

20:20.719 --> 20:23.916
before he becomes aware
of what we're thinking.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.514
lt takes a few minutes
for our brain activity

20:26.592 --> 20:28.890
to be processed by the system.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.419
Well, l've come to a decision,
with the help of my friends.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.523
You, leave. You, stay.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.501
And tell your beloved
Captain Janeway

20:37.569 --> 20:39.628
that if we die, they die,

20:39.705 --> 20:42.003
including you, dear Harry--

20:42.140 --> 20:44.608
you who becomes my best friend
as of today.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.304
Because she would never
kill you, would she, Harry?

20:47.379 --> 20:51.315
No. Why, she's like a dear
old mother to you, isn't she?

20:51.383 --> 20:52.315
Go!

20:59.458 --> 21:01.619
Someone's activated
the recall subroutine.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.319
Captain, it's Lieutenant Torres.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.756
Her body temperature is rising.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.701
She should regain consciousness
in about... 12 minutes.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.729
At least, we'll finally
get the answers

21:14.806 --> 21:15.830
to a few questions.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.453
Well, let's start
with the obvious question.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.455
lf they're demanding to exist,

21:31.523 --> 21:33.923
can we find a way
to let them exist

21:33.992 --> 21:36.688
in this artificial world
of theirs?

21:36.762 --> 21:38.161
Not unless you're prepared

21:38.230 --> 21:40.528
to leave one person
in stasis permanently.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.760
l concur with Lieutenant Torres.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.563
The computer uses
bioneural feedback

21:44.636 --> 21:47.434
from the participants' brains
to create the environment.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.997
Doctor, is there a way
to speed up resuscitation?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.610
Only by a few minutes.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.044
Anything more, we'd be risking
serious brain damage.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.911
Ten minutes would be
about the best we could do.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.679
Ten minutes and all
the hostages could be killed.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.220
Then it seems to me
our first order of business

22:03.288 --> 22:05.586
should be to reduce
the number of hostages.

22:05.657 --> 22:12.221
All we have to do now is decide
how to negotiate with...

22:12.297 --> 22:14.458
an emotion.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.868
With a manifestation...

22:18.937 --> 22:20.928
of fear.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.464
Fear is the most primitive,
the most primordial

22:24.543 --> 22:25.976
of biological responses.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.138
The ability
to recognize danger--

22:29.214 --> 22:30.545
to fight it or run away from it.

22:30.615 --> 22:31.639
That's what fear gives us,

22:31.717 --> 22:36.620
but... when fear
holds you hostage...

22:40.959 --> 22:43.826
how do you make it let go?

22:43.895 --> 22:46.159
Maybe we should try
to make them laugh.

22:46.231 --> 22:47.664
A good joke just...

22:49.334 --> 22:52.201
uh, seems to make fear dissolve.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.864
Well, it does in me, anyway.

22:54.940 --> 22:55.998
l think something

22:56.141 --> 22:59.372
a little more responsive
to The Clown's demand.

22:59.444 --> 23:02.379
B'Elanna, maybe you can come up

23:02.481 --> 23:05.450
with a way to modify the system

23:05.484 --> 23:08.578
so it can run
without bioneural interaction.

23:08.653 --> 23:09.881
How do we negotiate

23:09.955 --> 23:12.219
without sending in
another hostage?

23:12.290 --> 23:14.383
Good question.

23:14.459 --> 23:18.919
We have to come up with
a safer method of communication.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.761
l regret very much
what has happened to you.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.324
You came to help.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.200
You didn't deserve this.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.708
l regret so many things.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.080
Look.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.717
We don't have time for regret.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.590
My people are working
on a way-- right now--

23:49.661 --> 23:50.992
to get us out of here,

23:51.062 --> 23:52.927
and we have to help
them if we can.

23:52.998 --> 23:57.264
You'll leave hope behind
after a few months of this.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.836
Why does he do it?

24:04.910 --> 24:08.141
We're his canvas...

24:08.213 --> 24:10.238
his blocks of marble.

24:10.315 --> 24:14.547
With us, he practices
his ghastly art.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.382
Thinking about escape,
are we, Harry?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.923
Naughty, naughty.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.924
l don't like those thoughts.

24:21.026 --> 24:23.586
We're going to have to do
something about them.

24:23.662 --> 24:24.651
He's new.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.458
He can't help thinking
about getting out.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.691
He can!

24:27.766 --> 24:29.495
You don't think about it
anymore.

24:29.568 --> 24:31.900
Oh, but he's new...

24:31.970 --> 24:33.494
and you're old.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.472
New and old...

24:35.540 --> 24:37.531
old and new.

24:37.609 --> 24:40.510
Well, then, the answer
is to simply...

24:40.579 --> 24:42.570
make you old, Harry.

24:44.683 --> 24:47.880
Are you afraid of growing old,
Harry?

24:47.953 --> 24:50.444
ls that what you fear--

24:50.522 --> 24:53.184
being cared for by nurses?

24:53.258 --> 24:55.886
Time for your medicine.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.324
You don't like being helpless,
do you, Harry?

25:01.399 --> 25:04.857
You like to take care
of yourself.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.404
Yes, l know how you hate

25:07.472 --> 25:09.872
to feel
like the baby on the crew.

25:15.547 --> 25:16.878
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

25:16.948 --> 25:18.882
Oh, what's the matter, Harry?

25:18.984 --> 25:22.545
Ooh, does my costume
frighten you, huh? Ooh!

25:22.621 --> 25:23.553
Coochie-coo.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.583
Yeah. Oh, look
at little Harry fly!

25:27.659 --> 25:28.717
Whoo!

25:28.793 --> 25:30.454
Whoo! There he goes!

25:30.529 --> 25:31.928
Whoo!

25:32.030 --> 25:33.895
Whee!

25:33.965 --> 25:35.193
All right, that's enough.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.281
This is not reality.

25:51.349 --> 25:52.782
lt's an illusion.

25:52.851 --> 25:55.251
When your only reality
is an illusion,

25:55.320 --> 25:57.083
then illusion is a reality.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.517
Like the man said:

26:01.626 --> 26:06.893
''The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.''

26:06.932 --> 26:10.026
Oh, l thought we were
going to be friends.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.365
Didn't want to do this, Harry.

26:12.437 --> 26:14.871
No, l didn't want to bring this
up in front of the others,

26:14.973 --> 26:17.601
but l know
what really scares you.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.735
l know when you were nine

26:19.811 --> 26:21.870
and your parents took
you to that colony--

26:21.947 --> 26:23.642
the radiation disaster?

26:23.715 --> 26:25.649
Humanitarian mission?

26:25.717 --> 26:27.582
You visited a hospital!

26:27.652 --> 26:29.017
You remember.

26:30.755 --> 26:31.722
No.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.485
You wandered off by yourself

26:33.558 --> 26:36.186
where you weren't
supposed to be.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.286
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

26:38.363 --> 26:42.663
You saw people and things
you weren't supposed to see--

26:42.734 --> 26:44.565
sick and dying...

26:44.636 --> 26:45.898
Keep repeating:

26:45.971 --> 26:47.632
''The only thing we have to fear

26:47.706 --> 26:48.798
is fear itself!''

26:48.873 --> 26:51.842
''The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.''

26:51.910 --> 26:53.775
And how about:
''There's no place like home!

26:53.845 --> 26:55.642
There's no place like home!''

26:57.115 --> 26:59.413
Try clicking your heels
together three times.

26:59.484 --> 27:02.248
Oh, but your legs
are restrained, aren't they?

27:02.354 --> 27:05.448
Just like that little girl
you saw on the operating table?

27:05.490 --> 27:08.721
The doctor called
for a scalpel...

27:09.894 --> 27:11.486
She looked at you,

27:11.563 --> 27:14.464
her face filled with fear.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.526
Fear... fear.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.628
Fear.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.696
Do you remember?!

27:22.774 --> 27:25.368
No!

27:25.443 --> 27:26.910
Excuse me.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.912
You're not holding that
properly.

27:29.014 --> 27:30.811
Correct positioning
of the index finger

27:30.882 --> 27:32.543
is necessary
for optimal dexterity.

27:34.552 --> 27:35.541
Who are you?!

27:35.620 --> 27:38.282
l'm Captain Janeway's
representative.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.517
l'm here to negotiate with you.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.583
Are you well, Mr. Kim?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.856
l'm starting to feel better.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.328
You're different.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.593
l don't know anything about you.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.759
You're not on the system.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.029
l would be pleased to tell you
all about myself

27:52.103 --> 27:53.365
at a more appropriate time.

27:53.438 --> 27:54.735
For now, suffice it to say

27:54.806 --> 27:56.899
that l am here
by a miracle of technology.

27:56.975 --> 27:59.375
Now, let's get down
to the issues, shall we?

27:59.444 --> 28:00.877
How am l supposed to negotiate

28:00.979 --> 28:02.844
if l don't know
what you're thinking?

28:02.947 --> 28:04.972
l have a very trustworthy face.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.813
My Captain is prepared

28:06.885 --> 28:08.750
to give you exactly
what you ask for

28:08.820 --> 28:11.311
under the condition you release
all the hostages.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.852
Release the hostages?!

28:13.925 --> 28:16.723
We would provide continuing
input from a simulated brain.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.695
A computer model
that would generate...

28:18.763 --> 28:20.754
Simulated brain? Simulated?

28:20.832 --> 28:21.856
l myself have a com...

28:21.933 --> 28:22.865
lt won't work.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.595
lt's a lie. Tell 'em, Harry.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.398
l don't know that for sure.

28:26.471 --> 28:27.403
Liar!

28:27.472 --> 28:28.404
Viorsa!

28:28.473 --> 28:29.735
Get over here.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.543
Tell him.

28:32.610 --> 28:36.205
lt might require a recalibration
of the optronic pathways...

28:36.281 --> 28:37.805
Liar! After all this time,

28:37.882 --> 28:40.282
do you think l can't tell
when you lie?!

28:42.721 --> 28:44.245
-The simulated brain...
-Would leave me

28:44.322 --> 28:45.289
at your mercy!

28:45.356 --> 28:48.257
No. They stay.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.260
The Captain is prepared
to risk the lives

28:50.328 --> 28:52.125
of the hostages
rather than leave them

28:52.197 --> 28:53.391
under your control.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.865
Who is she to tell me
what l have to do?

28:55.934 --> 28:59.199
She's the one out there with
the ''off'' switch in her hand.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.033
She would never kill Harry.

29:01.139 --> 29:04.108
l'd rather die than spend
my life in here with you.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.372
She knows that.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.968
l won't let them go.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.604
A compromise.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.012
Let some of them go.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.208
No.

29:12.283 --> 29:13.750
We've studied your system.

29:13.818 --> 29:15.308
You only need one to survive.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.616
And if that one gets sick
and dies?

29:17.689 --> 29:19.247
No! l need them all.

29:19.324 --> 29:20.518
Now go away

29:20.592 --> 29:23.288
and tell your Captain Janeway
l'm disappointed.

29:23.361 --> 29:24.794
l expected more from her.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.091
lf we could just...

29:26.164 --> 29:27.358
Go away!

29:27.432 --> 29:28.729
Go away! Go away!

29:32.203 --> 29:33.170
l'll be back.

29:33.238 --> 29:34.398
Go away!

29:34.472 --> 29:40.502
Go away! Go away! Go away!

29:40.612 --> 29:43.775
Well, l'm sorry l don't live up
to his expectations.

29:43.848 --> 29:45.543
What's your opinion of him,
Doctor?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.016
Unstable...

29:47.085 --> 29:48.279
unpredictable.

29:48.353 --> 29:49.843
Everything you'd
expect from ''fear.''

29:49.921 --> 29:52.412
Captain, the longer
we allow this to continue,

29:52.490 --> 29:53.650
the more likely it is that he

29:53.725 --> 29:55.693
will take his frustrations
out on the hostages.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.318
l agree.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.295
And l can't allow that
to happen.

29:59.364 --> 30:02.765
We're going to have to mount
some kind of rescue mission.

30:09.207 --> 30:12.233
Doctor, if we do simply
disconnect the hostages...

30:12.310 --> 30:14.107
There would certainly
be brain damage.

30:14.179 --> 30:15.510
How much damage?

30:15.580 --> 30:16.842
Could you possibly repair it?

30:16.915 --> 30:18.246
Possibly? Yes.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.647
Would Mr. Kim still be able

30:19.717 --> 30:21.548
to hold his clarinet
when l was done?

30:21.619 --> 30:22.551
Possibly.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.986
The brain is such
an interesting organ.

30:25.056 --> 30:26.921
Could we switch over
to a simulated brain

30:26.991 --> 30:28.322
without The Clown noticing it?

30:28.393 --> 30:29.826
Oh, he'd notice.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.191
He was very smart to reject

30:31.262 --> 30:33.127
the whole notion
of a simulated brain.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.426
lt just wouldn't be the same.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.660
There is no way
an artificial intelligence

30:36.734 --> 30:39.100
can replace
actual brain functions.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.832
l'll choose not to take
that personally, Lieutenant.

30:41.906 --> 30:44.636
For what it's worth, Mr. Viorsa
suggested there would be a way

30:44.709 --> 30:47.337
to make a simulated brain
function in this system.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.846
He suggested it would take...

30:49.914 --> 30:53.077
a ''recalibration
of the optronic pathways.''

30:54.886 --> 30:56.649
l don't know what he could
have been talking about.

30:56.721 --> 30:57.710
The optronic pathways

30:57.789 --> 30:59.882
have nothing to do
with the neural interface.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.188
lt doesn't make any sense.

31:02.293 --> 31:05.057
Then, perhaps he had
another reason for saying it.

31:05.096 --> 31:07.189
How do the optronic
pathways function

31:07.265 --> 31:08.732
in this system, B'Elanna?

31:08.800 --> 31:09.926
They... they control

31:10.034 --> 31:12.400
the basic elements
of the environment,

31:12.470 --> 31:14.563
access data banks
that were programmed

31:14.639 --> 31:16.231
when the system was created.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.036
lf we interrupt
the optronic pathways,

31:23.114 --> 31:26.515
we could disassemble
that entire world

31:26.584 --> 31:29.678
and its characters,
piece by piece.

31:29.754 --> 31:34.088
lf we can't remove the hostages
from the environment,

31:34.158 --> 31:36.820
then we might be able
to remove the environment

31:36.895 --> 31:39.295
from the hostages.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.161
How did Viorsa manage
to communicate this

31:41.232 --> 31:42.790
without The Clown
knowing about it?

31:42.867 --> 31:45.768
Perhaps it was because The
Clown's attention was divided

31:45.837 --> 31:46.963
at the time.

31:47.038 --> 31:48.335
And you're going to continue

31:48.406 --> 31:50.431
to provide him
with distractions, Doctor.

31:50.508 --> 31:53.409
B'Elanna, how long will it take
to block these pathways?

31:53.478 --> 31:55.810
l'm not sure how many there are,
Captain.

31:55.880 --> 31:56.972
And l'll have to do it manually,

31:57.048 --> 31:58.879
because we don't know
how to deprogram the system.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.975
You'll only have
a few minutes at best.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.576
Once ''fear'' knows
what we're up to,

32:03.621 --> 32:05.316
it'll be a race against time

32:05.390 --> 32:07.620
to save the lives
of those hostages.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.489
Bravo! Bravo!

32:09.560 --> 32:10.527
Go away!

32:10.595 --> 32:11.926
l want to be alone.

32:11.996 --> 32:13.827
You're ruining the festival.

32:13.898 --> 32:16.059
Don't be a poop!

32:16.134 --> 32:17.533
l can't help it.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.069
l'm feeling sorry for myself.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.264
Well, don't take it out on us.

32:21.339 --> 32:23.068
Take it out on them.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.467
You people--

32:26.544 --> 32:28.341
you wonderful people--

32:28.413 --> 32:29.505
my friends...

32:30.615 --> 32:33.106
You do know how to make a man
feel better, don't you?

32:33.184 --> 32:36.176
Okay, then, what shall we play?

32:36.254 --> 32:38.654
The insect game.

32:38.723 --> 32:40.054
Yes, yes.
The insect game.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.088
You again?

32:45.163 --> 32:47.256
You're the one
who ruined my mood.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.266
You and your sweet Captain.

32:49.334 --> 32:52.201
My sweet Captain
has a new offer to make.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.897
No simulated brains.

32:53.972 --> 32:54.996
l want real brains.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.005
The Captain is prepared

32:56.107 --> 32:58.632
to give you...
a cloaking device.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.268
l already have
a cloaking device.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.676
Thank you anyway.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.443
l'm talking about a device
that would shield you

33:04.515 --> 33:08.110
from being detected by any
other interstellar visitors.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.265
There are almost 40 pathways
to disable, Captain,

33:22.333 --> 33:23.732
but l should be able
to get it done

33:23.801 --> 33:25.063
in under two minutes.

33:25.136 --> 33:27.866
Good.
Let's get started.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.930
We will return
your entire computer system

33:30.008 --> 33:32.374
to the subterranean locale
where we found it.

33:32.443 --> 33:34.206
With the help of Mr. Kim,

33:34.278 --> 33:35.939
and a team
of Starfleet engineers,

33:36.047 --> 33:38.845
it will be an easy matter
to install the cloaking device,

33:38.916 --> 33:41.851
which will ensure your safety
for the foreseeable future.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.614
Harry, is this possible?

33:43.688 --> 33:45.246
Yes.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.086
l don't know if l believe you.

33:47.158 --> 33:48.682
l don't know yet...

33:48.760 --> 33:50.990
but l'll know soon
if you're telling the truth.

33:51.062 --> 33:52.495
You can't fool me.

34:01.672 --> 34:03.003
What does she want in return?

34:03.074 --> 34:06.009
And don't say the hostages,
because l'm not giving them up.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.511
You have to understand that
the Captain's primary concern

34:08.579 --> 34:09.909
is the safety of the hostages.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.245
She's such a warm
and noble person.

34:12.315 --> 34:15.080
l'd love her to come
to one of my parties someday.

34:18.922 --> 34:22.188
What if l promise to take
really good care of my guests?

34:22.260 --> 34:24.159
We could be more than friends.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.253
We could be... colleagues.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.097
l'm really not such a bad fella.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.567
What's happening?

34:31.636 --> 34:32.864
You tricked me!

34:32.937 --> 34:36.668
lt's an attack!
lt's an attack!

34:36.741 --> 34:39.072
Red Alert! Red Alert!

34:39.143 --> 34:42.476
You... you warned them.

34:42.547 --> 34:43.878
You told them
how it could be done!

34:44.882 --> 34:45.746
Take him!

34:52.824 --> 34:55.384
No, please! No!

35:02.333 --> 35:03.800
Twenty-two.

35:03.868 --> 35:05.392
More than halfway there,
B'Elanna.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.404
Captain, it's Viorsa.

35:07.472 --> 35:09.565
His norepinephrine levels
are rising sharply.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.232
No, please!

35:11.309 --> 35:15.109
l didn't do anything!
l didn't do anything!

35:18.583 --> 35:19.880
What is it?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.112
Some kind of protection device.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.483
l'm locked out.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.215
l'll have to disable it.

35:55.219 --> 35:57.483
Viorsa's norepinephrine
levels are critical.

35:57.555 --> 36:00.217
Just ten more pathways.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.149
He's dead!

36:25.216 --> 36:26.683
Massive heart failure.

36:30.154 --> 36:31.849
Captain, this one's
norepinephrine levels

36:31.923 --> 36:32.912
are approaching critical.

36:33.024 --> 36:36.551
You're next!
You're next!

36:38.262 --> 36:39.695
Restore the entire program.

36:42.967 --> 36:44.491
We've lost.

36:44.569 --> 36:47.367
We've won. We've won.

36:47.438 --> 36:48.530
We've won!

36:48.606 --> 36:51.131
Start the music.
Start the music.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.736
Celebration. Celebration.

36:54.812 --> 36:56.803
Celebration.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.217
Your decision to capitulate

37:02.286 --> 37:04.811
saved the lives
of the other hostages, Captain.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.948
You should take
some comfort from that.

37:07.024 --> 37:08.082
l don't.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.995
Have l misjudged him somehow?

37:13.064 --> 37:16.864
ls there another way
to reach him?

37:16.968 --> 37:23.305
lsn't there more to ''fear''
than a simple demand to exist?

37:24.875 --> 37:28.106
Why do people enjoy
dangerous sports

37:28.179 --> 37:31.615
or holodeck adventures
with the safety off?

37:31.682 --> 37:34.549
Why, after all these centuries,

37:34.619 --> 37:37.144
do children still ride
on roller coasters?

37:37.221 --> 37:39.689
Fear can provide pleasure.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.384
To seek fear is to seek

37:41.459 --> 37:44.519
the boundaries of one's
sensory experience.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.928
But what does fear seek...

37:47.999 --> 37:52.231
at the end of the ride?

38:03.047 --> 38:04.275
You understand, don't you,
Harry,

38:04.348 --> 38:07.283
that we will have to punish you
for your Captain's little trick?

38:07.351 --> 38:08.750
To the winner go the spoils,

38:08.819 --> 38:11.185
and you are the spoils,
after all.

38:11.255 --> 38:12.517
We can talk about that later.

38:12.590 --> 38:14.581
For now, enjoy yourself.

38:17.561 --> 38:20.029
Well, you certainly know
how to bring a party to a halt.

38:20.097 --> 38:21.792
l don't get out very much.

38:21.866 --> 38:22.992
l bet.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.864
The Captain has sent me
with an ultimatum.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.870
Ultimatum?! Ultimatum.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.838
She would give me an ultimatum?

38:31.909 --> 38:34.673
Did Napoleon give an ultimatum
after Waterloo?

38:34.745 --> 38:37.475
Did Chulak of Romulus
give an ultimatum

38:37.548 --> 38:38.913
after his defeat
at Galorndon Core?

38:38.983 --> 38:42.714
We won. We give the ultimatums
around here.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.652
The Captain is prepared
to shut down the system

38:44.722 --> 38:46.849
one minute from now,
if you don't agree to her terms.

38:46.924 --> 38:49.654
And scramble the brains of all
my guests, including Harry?

38:49.727 --> 38:50.694
l don't think so.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.228
52 seconds.

38:52.296 --> 38:54.594
She is willing to risk
brain damage to the hostages,

38:54.665 --> 38:57.998
but she will end this, and end
this now, one way or another.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.237
What are her... her terms?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.067
43 seconds.

39:02.106 --> 39:04.097
She will allow you to keep
one person on the system.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.767
The other hostages
must be released.

39:05.843 --> 39:06.810
One?!

39:06.911 --> 39:08.378
Never! l won't agree.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.573
You have 30 seconds
to avoid termination.

39:10.648 --> 39:13.845
l need more time...
time to think.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.943
Two... let me keep two.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.578
20 seconds.

39:17.655 --> 39:18.679
There is another provision.

39:18.756 --> 39:20.690
The one hostage
you will be allowed to keep

39:20.758 --> 39:22.726
is Captain Janeway herself.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.321
She... would choose
to be with me?

39:26.397 --> 39:27.557
Your time is up.

39:27.631 --> 39:28.620
Your answer, please.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.600
Yes.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.103
Captain, this is the Doctor.

39:34.171 --> 39:36.139
l've returned to Sick Bay.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.767
Please turn to your emergency
medical holographic channel.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.310
Did he accept?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.504
Yes, Captain.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.240
Perfect.
Good work, Doctor.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.748
Would you like me
to return and supervise

39:45.816 --> 39:47.716
the evacuation of the hostages?

39:47.785 --> 39:49.582
l don't think that'll be
necessary, but you could

39:49.653 --> 39:51.587
help with the preparations
at this end. Janeway out.

39:51.655 --> 39:52.883
We're finished here, Captain.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.390
lnitiate the recall subroutine

39:54.458 --> 39:55.925
and prepare to begin
resuscitation.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.858
Kes, give me a hand
getting hooked up to all this.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.326
Sparkling.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.802
l want everything sparkling
for her arrival.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.031
Sparkling.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.766
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.705
Harry, not so fast.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.835
They can't have you
until l have her.

40:13.911 --> 40:14.969
No more tricks.

40:23.788 --> 40:25.881
She's coming.

40:25.956 --> 40:30.290
l can feel the system
beginning to scan her brain.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.623
Hmm... this really

40:31.695 --> 40:34.994
is such an extraordinary
gesture she's making.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.192
l am so moved.

40:40.471 --> 40:42.234
You don't quite believe it
yourself, do you?

40:42.306 --> 40:44.171
The Captain would
sacrifice herself

40:44.241 --> 40:45.367
to save the hostages.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.172
Sacrifice herself?

40:47.244 --> 40:49.872
You can be so cruel, Harry.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.915
You don't appreciate
my hospitality.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.395
You're here.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.228
You're actually here.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.131
l don't believe it.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.467
The arrangement was that
the others would be released.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.165
You show remarkable trust,
Captain.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.470
How could you be so sure
l would keep my word?

41:18.542 --> 41:20.510
l've known fear.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.342
lt's a very healthy thing
most of the time.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.473
You warn us of danger,

41:25.549 --> 41:26.880
remind us of our limits,

41:26.951 --> 41:28.976
protect us from carelessness.

41:29.053 --> 41:32.147
l've learned to trust fear.

41:32.223 --> 41:36.853
Finally, someone
who appreciates me.

41:36.927 --> 41:37.859
Am l blushing?

41:37.928 --> 41:39.225
Let them go.

41:39.296 --> 41:40.957
Yes. Yes, of course.

41:41.031 --> 41:42.498
You may depart.

41:42.566 --> 41:44.363
Farewell, my friends.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.528
Do come back and visit.

41:46.604 --> 41:48.834
l'll always be here.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.133
The recall subroutine
has been activated.

41:54.211 --> 41:55.644
Body temperatures are rising.

41:55.713 --> 41:57.681
lnitiating all backup systems.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.773
The hostages should
regain consciousness

41:59.850 --> 42:01.147
in less than ten minutes.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.049
We'll get you out of here,
Captain.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.315
l promise.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.413
That won't be necessary,
Mr. Kim,

42:06.490 --> 42:07.457
but thank you.

42:10.828 --> 42:13.023
l can't wait
to get to know you...

42:13.097 --> 42:14.928
to make you a part of me.

42:14.999 --> 42:17.832
As l understand it,
it takes a few minutes

42:17.902 --> 42:19.927
before you become aware
of my thoughts.

42:20.004 --> 42:21.130
ls that true?

42:21.205 --> 42:23.605
An eternity of anticipation.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.266
And then what happens?

42:25.342 --> 42:27.367
And then the fun begins.

42:27.444 --> 42:29.776
All systems functioning
as anticipated.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.338
Resuscitation
entering final warming.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.680
Bio-functions
are returning to normal.

42:34.752 --> 42:36.310
Their own hearts
are taking over.

42:36.387 --> 42:39.447
They don't need supplemental
life support any longer.

42:39.523 --> 42:41.423
Would you be honest with me?

42:41.492 --> 42:44.427
Fear is the most honest
of all emotions, Captain.

42:45.796 --> 42:49.288
You really want this to end
as much as l do, don't you?

42:49.366 --> 42:52.699
Now, now, don't even think
about leaving.

42:52.770 --> 42:55.762
l'm not going to let you go--
not after all this.

42:55.839 --> 42:57.067
Mirror?

42:58.175 --> 43:00.973
Don't we make
a beautiful couple, Captain?

43:01.078 --> 43:03.171
l'm not Captain Janeway.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.215
Could have fooled me.

43:06.283 --> 43:07.716
l'm afraid l did.

43:08.752 --> 43:09.719
Pardon?

43:09.787 --> 43:10.754
l'm nothing more

43:10.821 --> 43:12.914
than a holographic image
of Captain Janeway,

43:13.023 --> 43:17.255
sent here by the same technique
they used to send their Doctor.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.455
l've been programmed
to respond to you

43:19.530 --> 43:20.929
as Kathryn Janeway would.

43:21.031 --> 43:24.364
But... but... l-l feel you.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.663
You-you're on the system.

43:25.736 --> 43:30.105
She is on the system,
yes, but not in stasis.

43:31.809 --> 43:34.277
Captain Janeway and her
crew modified the pods,

43:34.345 --> 43:36.176
so that she could be
connected to the system

43:36.246 --> 43:38.840
without having to enter
this environment.

43:38.916 --> 43:41.350
The goal was to let you
sense her brain activity

43:41.418 --> 43:43.818
without putting her
in actual jeopardy.

43:43.887 --> 43:46.117
You will be able to confirm
what l'm telling you

43:46.190 --> 43:48.852
as soon as you become
aware of her thoughts.

44:07.911 --> 44:08.878
You know as well as l do

44:08.946 --> 44:11.813
that fear only exists
for one purpose--

44:11.882 --> 44:13.042
to be conquered.

44:13.117 --> 44:15.108
She tricked me.

44:15.185 --> 44:16.277
Did she?

44:16.353 --> 44:19.789
Or was a part of you actually
hoping to be defeated?

44:19.857 --> 44:22.917
lsn't that why you allowed
Captain Janeway to come here?

44:22.993 --> 44:26.690
Because you sensed
she had the power to subdue you?

44:26.764 --> 44:28.755
No.

44:28.832 --> 44:30.390
She lied.

44:30.467 --> 44:32.833
lt was very unStarfleet of her.

44:32.903 --> 44:36.805
Starfleet Captains
don't easily succumb... to fear.

44:40.744 --> 44:43.304
What will become of us?

44:43.380 --> 44:45.848
Of me?

44:45.916 --> 44:51.377
Like all fear,
you eventually... vanish.

44:53.290 --> 44:55.155
l'm afraid.

44:55.225 --> 44:57.887
l know.

44:59.229 --> 45:00.423
Drat.
