22:41.280 --> 22:42.996
Someone killed him.

22:46.672 --> 22:48.499
You said he brought you a gift.

22:48.673 --> 22:51.049
- What was it?
- Huh?

22:51.095 --> 22:52.408
The gift.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.064
Oh... uh...

22:57.487 --> 23:00.513
It's in that box under the red scarf.

23:01.181 --> 23:02.359
How...

23:02.484 --> 23:04.686
How was Dennis killed?

23:05.188 --> 23:06.621
He was stabbed.

23:06.657 --> 23:09.387
<i>♪</i>

23:19.077 --> 23:20.730
Three sets of prints were lifted.

23:20.855 --> 23:23.342
One was traced back to the store
clerk where these were bought.

23:23.355 --> 23:25.732
The other two: Dennis
Lemash and Craig Rykart.

23:25.751 --> 23:28.106
There were no prints on the
murder weapon. She was careful.

23:28.128 --> 23:30.332
I wouldn't expect the killer's
prints to be on the box.

23:30.354 --> 23:32.926
Angelica Holander did not break
into Rykart's dressing room

23:32.962 --> 23:35.015
and steal a knife she
didn't know was there.

23:35.209 --> 23:36.934
Well how do you know
that she didn't know?

23:36.993 --> 23:38.187
The same way you know she did.

23:38.198 --> 23:40.487
- Those are both unknown.
- I know.

23:40.523 --> 23:41.555
<i>He doesn't know.</i>

23:41.590 --> 23:44.173
- Who knows?
- Oh, my head hurts.

23:44.999 --> 23:48.061
Look, murder investigations
sometimes have loose ends.

23:48.079 --> 23:50.813
- This is one of those.
- Well, this is a big one.

23:51.624 --> 23:52.888
Then tie it up.

23:54.542 --> 23:59.739
- Alright.
- (KNOCKING)

23:59.774 --> 24:02.528
- Hey.
- Hey, TV star.

24:02.545 --> 24:04.490
Good thing you're
here. Can I borrow you?

24:04.513 --> 24:06.906
Sure, Cyndee Pratt.
This is Detective Shaw.

24:06.914 --> 24:08.126
Sam, this is Cyndee.

24:08.163 --> 24:09.531
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:12.216 --> 24:15.431
- Whoa, okay.
- Oh, hm.

24:15.470 --> 24:16.694
You are the right size.

24:16.713 --> 24:18.233
Whoa. It's kinda heavy.

24:18.302 --> 24:21.360
Well, Craig likes to feel the
weight of it when he's on stage.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.764
<i>Everything has to come
from a real place.</i>

24:23.796 --> 24:26.738
- It's what makes him so great.
- Sure, strap some C-4 on him

24:26.757 --> 24:30.356
- that is real.
- Well, C-4 is hard to get.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.347
Yeah, there's that whole
two day waiting period,

24:32.371 --> 24:33.604
totally bogus.

24:33.632 --> 24:36.640
- That's quite a collection you got there.
- <i>Oh yeah, thanks.</i>

24:37.817 --> 24:38.895
Rubber.

24:39.747 --> 24:40.945
I made these myself.

24:41.070 --> 24:43.173
We just need to ask you
a couple of questions.

24:43.201 --> 24:45.627
You heard about what
happened to Dennis Lemash?

24:46.664 --> 24:49.505
Yeah... yeah, he was stabbed, right?

24:49.846 --> 24:52.499
Is that, uh, is that a confession?

24:53.627 --> 24:57.269
I'm not gonna lie to you
and tell you I liked him.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.828
But I didn't kill him.

24:59.930 --> 25:02.789
Just didn't shed any tears either.

25:03.005 --> 25:04.981
Did you ever see him
Craig and Dennis arguing?

25:05.002 --> 25:08.570
Oh yeah, sure. I mean artistic
directors and producers argue.

25:08.606 --> 25:09.871
<i>It happens.</i>

25:09.907 --> 25:11.438
Well, what were they arguing about?

25:11.563 --> 25:13.986
Money, creative differences.

25:16.026 --> 25:20.581
Yeah, I mean Dennis wanted
to do more of the... the classics.

25:20.617 --> 25:23.483
You know, he wanted to do
a production of Macbeth,

25:23.511 --> 25:27.141
but Craig was more interested
in making a political statement.

25:27.352 --> 25:29.641
- Macbeth is political.
- Was.

25:29.698 --> 25:31.466
400 years ago.

25:31.591 --> 25:35.008
Solomon's Siege is about the
Dreider Mine disaster and coverup.

25:35.361 --> 25:37.173
Those bastards need to be exposed

25:37.184 --> 25:39.220
and the theatre's the only way to do it.

25:39.345 --> 25:41.992
Okay, look, no offense, but, you know,

25:41.997 --> 25:44.350
a small play that hardly
anyone's going to see

25:44.364 --> 25:46.471
isn't going to bring about justice.

25:47.385 --> 25:50.167
Are you offering to
get involved, TV star?

25:50.498 --> 25:52.911
Because that might help our small play.

25:52.947 --> 25:55.182
When was the last time you saw Dennis?

25:55.348 --> 25:58.733
It was early, like... like
five in the morning early.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.708
Craig was getting ready
for the park performance.

26:00.732 --> 26:03.523
Opening night, Dennis, is this weekend.

26:03.541 --> 26:05.761
I'm sorry, but this
is just the way it is.

26:05.803 --> 26:07.014
<i>Dennis said something about going</i>

26:07.028 --> 26:08.654
<i>to the bank when it was opening.</i>

26:08.779 --> 26:10.247
<i>CRAIG: Get out!</i>

26:10.372 --> 26:12.130
<i>CYNDEE: There were some
financial problems.</i>

26:12.165 --> 26:13.692
He wanted to return the money.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.101
He wanted to give it back to the bank.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.382
Did Craig follow
Dennis out that morning?

26:17.585 --> 26:20.574
I... I don't know, but when
I went to look for him,

26:20.699 --> 26:22.020
he was gone.

26:23.853 --> 26:25.557
<i>(KNOCKING)</i>

26:25.682 --> 26:28.790
Hey, the detective has a
few things she has to do.

26:28.814 --> 26:30.213
It'll only be a minute.

26:34.653 --> 26:36.136
(SIGH)

26:37.402 --> 26:39.692
Are you my babysitter, Mr. Carter?

26:40.038 --> 26:41.903
Oh, no-no-no, I'm just...

26:42.028 --> 26:43.940
I'm just trying to
stay out of their way.

26:43.976 --> 26:45.475
Cops... you know...

26:45.943 --> 26:47.276
Why are you here?

26:47.481 --> 26:49.061
Well, this is my hometown.

26:49.148 --> 26:51.903
No-no-no. Here. Doing this.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.547
You know,

26:54.514 --> 26:56.006
I'm gonna be honest with you,

26:56.034 --> 26:58.447
I can't stand it on my show anymore.

26:59.189 --> 27:00.611
Those people are...

27:01.316 --> 27:02.836
driving me crazy.

27:02.896 --> 27:04.793
It's just the same thing
over and over again.

27:04.807 --> 27:09.492
Week after week... I just
say the same clever quips.

27:09.515 --> 27:11.025
It's the same story lines.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.683
Dead body at the
beginning of the episode.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.060
Charlie Carter comes in,

27:14.088 --> 27:16.442
guns blazing, catches the killer.

27:19.375 --> 27:20.753
Demand more.

27:21.244 --> 27:22.563
It's not that easy.

27:22.983 --> 27:24.834
A lot of big companies make a lot of

27:25.009 --> 27:26.425
big money on a show like that.

27:26.446 --> 27:30.880
I'll be on these calls with like
10 executives in Beverly Hills

27:30.894 --> 27:35.172
just talking about what kind of
shoes my character should be wearing.

27:35.711 --> 27:37.986
Nobody suffers like a celebrity.

27:39.294 --> 27:41.271
Come on man, it's... it's not like that.

27:41.303 --> 27:42.920
I'm just trying to relate here.

27:43.165 --> 27:46.967
Actor to actor. You and
I are in the same boat.

27:48.302 --> 27:50.003
You are not in my boat.

27:51.305 --> 27:53.673
<i>We are not even sailing the same ocean.</i>

27:54.275 --> 27:55.908
I believe in art.

27:56.219 --> 27:57.543
I believe in beauty.

27:57.579 --> 28:00.424
I believe in creating
characters that connect

28:00.489 --> 28:03.519
with people in a deep,
meaningful, honest place.

<i>That is the theatre.</i>

That what you and
Dennis fought about?

28:17.857 --> 28:18.981

28:19.018 --> 28:21.500
The guys with the money always
think they know what's best.

28:21.514 --> 28:23.233
He wanted to do the classics.

28:24.167 --> 28:27.432
Solomon's Siege is an important work.

It is going to be Brechtian
in scope and power.

<i>Yeah, that they covered up.

28:39.985 --> 28:42.801
Twenty of their top executives
are coming to see it.

28:42.827 --> 28:44.947
They bought out the first
two rows for opening night.

28:44.961 --> 28:46.255
Like they could intimidate us.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.790
Dennis could silence you.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.793
No money no new theatre.
No opening night.

28:51.195 --> 28:52.928
But Dennis didn't take the money away.

28:52.963 --> 28:55.130
Because he never got the chance.

28:55.190 --> 28:58.708
Oh... ah...

29:00.122 --> 29:02.213
you think I killed him.

The murder weapon did come
from your dressing room.

There are a dozen people

29:06.820 --> 29:09.441
- in and out of that room all day, every day.
- Okay.

29:10.013 --> 29:12.960
Where were you the
morning Dennis was killed?

29:12.970 --> 29:14.281
At the park.

29:14.609 --> 29:16.918
- Lots of witnesses.
- No, before that.

29:16.933 --> 29:19.353
You left the theatre and you
followed Dennis to the bank.

29:19.388 --> 29:20.898
No I didn't.

29:20.957 --> 29:23.986

Dennis drive away with Angelica.
