-Fuck that.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.016
I'm the one who's impressed.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.352
Leaving Harvard Law school
to fight for your country,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.720
they should put
your face on a stamp.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.789
No, a mountain.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.125
-What did you do? Two tours?
-Three.

14:52.159 --> 14:55.562
And then you go
and get yourself shot
in San Francisco.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.797
-That's a hell of a thing.
-Hmm.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.932
Thank you, Betsy.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.233
Thank you.
You forgot my friend here.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.102
Oh, I'm fine,
thank you very much.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.743
She's a good woman. Betsy.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.746
She's been with me,
oh, my God,
I don't even know how long.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.149
Our secret, yeah?

15:16.183 --> 15:17.985
Middle of the day,
she'll ground me for a week.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.989
Why am I here, Mr. Stein?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.393
You're right. Time's money.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.628
Especially, when you
bill by the half hour.
Sit down.

15:28.661 --> 15:29.997
Thank you.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.965
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:35.802 --> 15:38.571
Okay, what do you
know about me?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.440
Uh, you went to Loyola Law.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.610
You started your own firm
and now you have
30 lawyers working for you.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.212
Even I can Google, son.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.749
You haven't been inside
a courtroom in 20 years.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.919
If the other side forces you
into a courtroom,

15:52.952 --> 15:54.754
you've already lost.
What else?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.156
I know you once
dated Laura Linney.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.791
(LAUGHS) I did.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.127
Took her to a Bulls game.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.694
Her father was a client.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.196
You drink Michter's Bourbon.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.465
You claim to have
a 15 handicap but it's...

16:05.498 --> 16:06.633
It's really 12, isn't it?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.468
No, no, no, it's a 15.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.603
I just play a whole lot better
when money's on the line.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.005
I don't like losing.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.840
And I don't like being tested.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.287
General Lance Howard
is a very good friend of mine.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.222
I've known him
for a very long time.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.291
I tell him I'm in a jam,

16:31.324 --> 16:33.126
and I need help
getting out of it,

16:33.160 --> 16:35.995
he recommends you,
says you're pretty good.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.964
Well, I guess
that depends on, uh,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.466
what it is that
you want me to do?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.867

16:40.900 --> 16:43.503
God damn it,
I love you Harvard guys.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.172
Okay.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.310
Someone snatched a redwell
from my office.

16:50.343 --> 16:54.147
There's some very
sensitive information
about the firm in it.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.349
My problem is
some son of a bitch

16:56.383 --> 17:00.553

Adam Hutchings somehow
got his hands on the contents

17:00.587 --> 17:02.722
and now he's hassling
my employees.

He knows things
he should not know.

17:06.459 --> 17:10.563
Information that only someone
from inside my firm
would have access to.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.266
I represent some
very high-profile people.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.770
It gets out that
I can't keep confidential
information confidential,

17:17.804 --> 17:22.142
my business, my career,
my whole ball game
is shot to shit.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.278

with the partners,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.395
and work your way down
to the woman who cleans
the pisspot at night.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.965
-All right.
-There's also some cash,

17:45.998 --> 17:48.968
keys to an apartment
in one of my buildings
and keys to a Buick Lacrosse.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.770
I hope that's okay.
I only buy American.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.441
I'll see what I can do,
Mr. Stein.

Ethan?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.816
If I didn't say it before,
I'm saying it now,

18:04.817 --> 18:06.753

gonna get me clipped.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.285
Where the fuck we going?

18:38.318 --> 18:39.619
You're going to jail.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.588
For what?
I gave you everything.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.024
What you said was there was
a big deal going down
last night at the Yards.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.994
What happened last night
at 11 p.m.?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.164
Nothing happened.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.499
So they switched up,
that's on me?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.867
Who was the white guy
at the Yards, Lobo?

18:54.901 --> 18:56.769
Man, I don't know
white people.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.305
And I wasn't even
there last night.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.539
Hey.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.943
I don't know this

facial recognition and shit?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.180
All right, Patrick, pull over.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.486
You're about to throw
a 14-month relationship
out the window.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.390
What, you want me
to ask around
who the white guy was?

19:17.424 --> 19:19.226
That's the general idea, Lobo.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.660
Get me a name.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.129
Find out what
he was doing there.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.664
And this is where
you get out of the car.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.469
Oh, man,

to be meeting

20:15.715 --> 20:17.484
He wouldn't miss this
for the world.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.920
Freddy, you mind?

Marty Stein represents
about 600 clients
in a variety of businesses

the arts, manufacturing
and finance.

contravening US sanctions.

that I had to clean up
all the shit you left behind.

if it were up to me,

30:52.184 --> 30:54.853
His name is Ron Keeler.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.589
He's a dentist.
Lives out in Barrington.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.392
They just notified
next of kin.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.429
So what's Ron Keeler
doing with Cups in

we swing by,

31:05.531 --> 31:07.399

see what's what.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.406
You're gonna share
with the class?

31:14.440 --> 31:16.943
I know that's not a coffee pot
in the drawer.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.644
Come on.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.818

drink whiskey?

It's my dad's birthday.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.303
To Papa Deakins.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.941
He kept a bottle of that stuff

in the kitchen.

31:50.776 --> 31:53.879

every night before dinner.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.614
So, this one night,
when I was 12,

31:55.647 --> 31:56.782
I climbed up on the counter,

31:56.815 --> 31:58.384
poured myself a glass...

31:58.417 --> 31:59.451
(SNORTS)

31:59.485 --> 32:01.320
...burned my toes.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.755
So, of course I just

32:03.789 --> 32:05.791
filled it with enough water
so he wouldn't notice.

32:05.824 --> 32:09.495
Mmm. They do notice.
I got scars to prove it.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.466
That night at dinner,

32:14.500 --> 32:16.835
I take a big gulp
of my iced tea,

32:17.669 --> 32:18.937
and I swear, I...

32:18.971 --> 32:21.407
It was like my insides
were on fire.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.809
He just looked
at me and winked.

32:23.842 --> 32:24.977
Didn't say a word.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.848
So, now every year
on his birthday...

32:32.151 --> 32:34.186
I could pound a few
with a guy like that.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.157
He'd put up with you
if he was still around.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.858
Shit.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.193
I'm sorry.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.365
He'd be fuckin' proud of you,
you know that?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.235

32:56.742 --> 32:58.577

something with him.

sidelined so

33:41.019 --> 33:42.521
he's pissed.

Kinda maybe deserved it.

right there, please.

42:40.491 --> 42:42.594

you two about that?

Unfortunately, Dr. Keeler,

42:48.767 --> 42:50.902

have to handle that.

42:50.936 --> 42:54.172

in the accident.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.918

43:06.952 --> 43:09.287
So, if you two weren't close,
why did he have your car?

43:09.320 --> 43:10.889
He had my keys.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.791
Gave him 20 bucks to move it
while I was away,

43:12.824 --> 43:14.425
for street cleaning.

43:16.161 --> 43:18.463

he could drive it.

or some shit?

43:28.840 --> 43:31.442
Yeah, kinda. He was
one of those, uh,

43:32.177 --> 43:34.913

44:38.676 --> 44:40.511
Yeah, my wife and kids might.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.817
So, you're saying Hutchings
was blackmailing you.

to talk about some

for Marty every year.

44:58.864 --> 45:00.866
Mmm-hmm.

the closing document.

45:03.869 --> 45:06.704

45:06.738 --> 45:09.207

the Crown building on Douglas?

a shitty neighborhood.

the document?
-I gave him the finger.

something to my brother
and then there was...

Isn't just me he's been
hounding, though.

45:30.996 --> 45:32.864
What do you mean?

45:32.898 --> 45:36.101
It means, Hutchings has been
talking to everyone
involved in that deal.
