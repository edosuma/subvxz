00:03.960 --> 00:06.160
- You got this, do you ?
- More or less, yeah.

00:07.640 --> 00:08.600
Hands !

00:12.340 --> 00:14.163
He's the prince of lies, sweetheart.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.560
Can't trust a word
that comes out of his mouth.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.760
Where's that shitload of cocaine ?

00:19.840 --> 00:21.920
- I told you I don't have it.
- Liar.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.720
- Did you find the drugs ?
- No.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.360
He's three hours late to delivering
five million quid's worth of cocaine.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.560
- I am an innocent man, Mr. Worth.
- No, you are not.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.760
Where is the bag now ?

00:48.160 --> 00:49.440
What do you call a man
who tells lies ?

00:49.520 --> 00:50.600
My husband's not a liar !

00:51.295 --> 00:53.911
For sentimental reasons
I always go on two.

00:53.991 --> 00:55.060
- Five.
- No !

00:55.228 --> 00:56.460
- Four.
- Wait !

00:56.540 --> 00:58.180
- Three.
- I traffic cocaine !

00:59.660 --> 01:00.880
You're all going to die.

01:02.940 --> 01:04.280
My god.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.380
- Put them on the ground.
- On the ground now. Get down.

01:13.460 --> 01:15.700
- Everyone down.
- Stay down.

01:20.860 --> 01:23.500
- Hello ?
- Motherfucker.

01:26.500 --> 01:31.180
- What is your problem ?
- No, I don't have a problem.

01:31.260 --> 01:34.460
- You have a problem.
- Who is this ?

02:48.100 --> 02:49.940
Fuck !

03:21.420 --> 03:24.100
That cop you told me not to kill...

03:24.180 --> 03:28.500
He's coming after me right now
so what the fuck am I supposed to do ?

03:28.580 --> 03:33.300
He was with Liverpool.
The operations fucked. So are you.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.620
I want to talk.

05:20.740 --> 05:22.900
How many are you ?

05:31.500 --> 05:34.980
My orders were to kill the priest
and pull out.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.620
My whole fucking operation's
just been terminated.

05:39.980 --> 05:44.060
I want to know why.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.100
How the fuck should I know ?

05:49.220 --> 05:51.020
Who are you ?

05:53.300 --> 05:56.340
And what the fuck is "Liverpool ?"

06:05.060 --> 06:06.980
What did you fucking say ?

06:09.060 --> 06:11.140
Liverpool.

07:30.060 --> 07:35.340
TIN STAR

09:08.780 --> 09:11.860
It's okay, it's over.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.980
It's okay. He's okay.

09:24.180 --> 09:29.020
Hey, Jack, what happened ?
What did he wanna talk about ?

09:32.460 --> 09:36.660
Jack, what ?

12:36.460 --> 12:38.020
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:38.740 --> 12:43.220
- Can I help you ?
- Is this an okay time ?

12:43.300 --> 12:45.920
Are you looking for Angela ? She's not
here, I don't know where she is.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.140
No. I'm actually looking for you.

12:49.780 --> 12:52.100
- I'd like to ask you some questions.
- About what ?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.420
Are you going somewhere ?

12:59.580 --> 13:01.820
Yeah, Toronto actually,
to see my kids.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.260
In fact I'm a little bit late
and I don't want to miss the flight.

13:04.340 --> 13:07.300
I'm gonna have to ask you
to come down to the station.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.380
Why ?

13:10.460 --> 13:13.900
- Do you know this woman ?
- Yes.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.140
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.180
What do I do ?

13:29.620 --> 13:32.420
- Call the police.
- You'll be arrested.

13:35.060 --> 13:38.940
I'll go talk to them,
find out what happened.

13:49.940 --> 13:53.060
What is going on here, Mrs. Nickel ?

13:53.140 --> 13:57.140
- I have no idea Mr. Quiring.
- Gunshots ! Power cuts ?

13:57.220 --> 13:59.940
- Nothing to do with us.
- I doubt that.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.300
Leave her alone.

14:03.300 --> 14:07.940
I think it would be best if you and
your friends were to leave the colony.

14:16.380 --> 14:20.140
I won't be turned out of my own home,
Mr. Quiring.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.500
By you or anyone else.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.980
Come !

14:52.420 --> 14:54.340
Christ.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.100
What's going on here, Jack ?

15:15.980 --> 15:18.420
Jack, what's going on ?

15:25.780 --> 15:28.740
Hey, talk to me !

15:36.940 --> 15:39.660
Are you wearing sun screen ?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.660
What ?

16:02.940 --> 16:05.420
You're not going to tell me.

16:27.020 --> 16:31.660
- One, two, three.
- Need a hand ?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.340
No we got this.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.380
I've seen it all now.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.620
- Don't shut me out.
- I'm not.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.660
I don't want you
to protect me anymore.

16:52.740 --> 16:56.020
I want you to teach me
how to protect myself.

16:56.820 --> 16:59.260
- How ?
- Include me.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.540
In everything.

17:06.540 --> 17:07.780
Alright.

17:09.380 --> 17:11.540
Starting with this.

17:33.660 --> 17:37.780
You have saved my life.
The lives of my family. Thank you.

17:37.860 --> 17:41.380
Mr. Worth ? Jack.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.260
- What ?
- Please.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.380
- You got pigs haven't you ?
- Pigs ?

17:57.900 --> 17:59.780
Here you are.

18:00.940 --> 18:03.300
Bite size chunks.

18:14.580 --> 18:18.340
Anna, do you want to get changed ?

18:20.580 --> 18:23.500
- Not yet.
- Okay.

18:27.260 --> 18:30.100
They're worse off than
they were before.

18:31.220 --> 18:35.140
The cartel have lost their drugs
and their bagman.

18:37.740 --> 18:40.260
We've got to do something
to help them.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.380
You're telling me Elizabeth
has nicked the drugs ?

19:14.460 --> 19:16.820
Well, there's nobody else.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.420
Elizabeth ?

19:49.100 --> 19:52.180
If I was her
I'd have fucked off by now.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.140
Her car's still in the drive.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.980
Is this where you slept ?

20:04.020 --> 20:05.820
Yeah.

20:06.860 --> 20:09.460
Not that I slept much.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.900
I missed you.

20:41.980 --> 20:44.300
I'm really sorry.

20:47.420 --> 20:50.740
- For putting you through all of this.
- No...

20:51.380 --> 20:55.140
No, don't apologize.

21:50.180 --> 21:52.020
It's me.

21:53.540 --> 21:56.500
- Jack.
- I'm listening.

22:00.540 --> 22:02.700
We're coming Jack.

22:09.340 --> 22:11.780
We're coming for all of you.

22:15.220 --> 22:17.940
How long we got ?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.960
- We're next !
- I don't understand.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.080
If the bagman is dead,
then who poisoned the cattle ?

24:15.160 --> 24:17.800
There must be more
than one of them.

24:17.880 --> 24:21.680
It's a sign.
The cattle is just the beginning.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.160
- It'll be the whole colony next !
- We don't know that, Sarah.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.120
Well, we're not going
to stay here to find out.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.960
- Where will we go ?
- Nelson. To my cousins.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.520
I'm not going to Nelson.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.480
I'm not going to Nelson !

24:40.360 --> 24:42.200
- You need to let them know.
- Let who know ?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.560
- Everyone. The whole colony.
- I'm their pastor.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.240
Yes you are. This is your flock.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.920
You need to let them know the truth.
A cartel is coming.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.600
Everyone must leave !

24:52.680 --> 24:57.120
If Anna comes back with the bag maybe
the cartel will just leave us alone.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.200
This is your doing.
You have to account for it !

25:02.120 --> 25:05.240
If you don't tell them, I will, Johan.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.720
What do we tell the Nickels ?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.720
We tell them we tried.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.960
Police Chief Denise Minahik here
with Constable Nick McGillen.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.840
And... Please, say your name
for the tape.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.440
Elizabeth Bradshaw.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.080
Pause the interview.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.200
Interview paused.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.480
- What are you doing here ?
- I need some vests.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.120
What's going on ? Tell me !

26:10.920 --> 26:14.440
- Tell me !
- I'm fucking scared.

26:16.720 --> 26:21.480
You stay away from me,
stay away from my family alright.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.880
You're freaking me out.
What's going on ?

26:25.960 --> 26:27.840
You take care of yourself.

26:28.240 --> 26:32.240
Okay, wait. One second, just wait.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.280
- Thanks.
- You look after your family.

26:53.320 --> 26:57.120
- You got a problem ?
- Maybe.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.960
Give her enough rope.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.240
What the hell is going on ?

27:08.920 --> 27:11.200
I have no idea.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.160
Haven't got much time.

27:45.200 --> 27:50.480
So whatever it is you want...
Let's get it done alright.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.920
You're supposed to be tracking Jack,
you daft sod.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
We get paid by the hour.

28:12.320 --> 28:17.040
You see that's the problem
with career criminals these days.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.680
- No loyalty.
- Just pay up.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.720
- I can't.
- Can't ?

28:25.560 --> 28:28.760
- He cleaned me out.
- What ?

28:30.120 --> 28:31.720
- I'm skint.
- Skint ?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.360
Yeah, broke. Bankrupt.
Financially embarrassed.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.520
You're kidding, right ?

28:38.320 --> 28:40.960
We take Jack, we get the money back.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.680
- Pro-bono ? Fuck that.
- You can't just walk out on me.

28:45.880 --> 28:48.560
You're lucky our deal
wasn't pay or play.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.400
Will you get off me.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.160
You know what I'd do if I was you ?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.640
I'm not really in the mood
for friendly advice if you don't mind.

29:04.720 --> 29:08.040
If my whole fucking life had boiled
down to one giant fucking resentment ?

29:10.200 --> 29:13.160
I'd buy a bag of cocaine
and two hookers.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.160
And then I'd kill myself.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.840
Interview resumed.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.360
Let's start with the bruises
and cuts on your wrists.

29:49.440 --> 29:54.280
The witness has some pretty nasty
lacerations and bruising to her wrists.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.040
I was knocked unconscious,
tied up and locked in a cabinet.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.320
- By who ?
- I don't know.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.280
- You didn't see anyone ?
- No.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.640
You know who would knock you out
and put in a cabinet ?

30:07.760 --> 30:09.400
No.

30:10.200 --> 30:15.040
- Would you like to make a report ?
- I just want to go home to my family.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.640
- Do you know who this woman is ?
- Yes.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.760
The witness is identifying
a picture of Jaclyn Letendre.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.040
And what is your relationship
with her ?

30:37.520 --> 30:40.160
I was investigating allegations
that Jaclyn made

30:40.240 --> 30:43.080
against my former employer,
Northstream Oil.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.080
What allegations ?

30:45.160 --> 30:48.160
That she was deliberately
intimidated into silence by them

30:48.240 --> 30:49.960
after her children were killed.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.520
I stood up for her and other members
of the First Nations community

30:54.600 --> 30:57.960
who lost loved ones
in a carbon dioxide leak.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.520
Looks like you're yanking
on the wrong chain.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.560
Wait outside.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.840
Now.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.880
Okay.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.080
Constable McGillen.
Leaving the room.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.680
Can you describe for us
the exact circumstances

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
of your last interaction with Jaclyn ?

31:46.080 --> 31:49.360
- Yes. I took her for breakfast.
- Where ?

31:49.440 --> 31:51.400
Somewhere downtown.
I think The Guild.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.960
- In Calgary ?
- Yes.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.440
And was that the only reason
you came to Calgary ? Breakfast ?

31:55.520 --> 31:57.280
- No.
- What else did you do ?

31:58.640 --> 32:02.760
Jaclyn and I went
to confront Northstream.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.320
And I was fired for it.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.160
- What time did you get to Northstream ?
- Around nine.

32:09.240 --> 32:13.880
I have an eyewitness who says you and
Jaclyn leave Reverie around seven p.m.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.760
You're telling you got to Northstream
at nine am the next morning.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.480
What were you doing
in-between those hours ?

32:23.480 --> 32:25.760
Wait.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.640
We did stop on the side
of the road for a nap.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.000
Is something the matter ?

32:40.080 --> 32:42.400
- It just doesn't add up.
- What doesn't add up ?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.080
Reverie Little Big Bear, two hours.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.520
Little Big Bear to Calgary,
three hours.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.680
You telling me you stopped on the side
of the road for 9 hours ?

32:52.520 --> 32:55.920
- I'm a witness. Not a suspect.
- Can you just answer the question ?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
- Is this an interrogation ?
- Do you need me to repeat it ?

32:58.080 --> 33:00.440
Because if this is an interrogation,
you need to arrest me first.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.360
- Are you refusing to cooperate ?
- Of course not.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.520
- So then answer the question !
- What question ?

33:16.800 --> 33:20.080
For the tape, I'm showing a still
frame footage for the CCTV footage

33:20.160 --> 33:23.400
of the Worth house on the night
in question.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.400
Is this you ?

33:31.920 --> 33:35.600
- I guess so.
- Is it or isn't it ?

33:37.680 --> 33:39.440
Yes.

33:40.240 --> 33:43.600
You were at the Worth house
that night ?

33:49.080 --> 33:52.400
- Yes.
- So you lied ?

33:52.480 --> 33:54.200
Why would you do that ?

33:59.840 --> 34:03.560
I went to the Worth house that night
because I feared of my life.

34:03.640 --> 34:07.000
Louis Gagnon, Northstream's head
of security, came after Jaclyn and I.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.480
And I didn't know where else to go.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.600
Angela killed him with a shotgun.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.360
About a week later,
Jaclyn came to blackmail Angela,

34:20.440 --> 34:22.120
for killing in self-defense.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.719
Where is Jaclyn ?

34:29.960 --> 34:33.120
- I don't know.
- Are you sure ?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.960
Yes.

34:37.679 --> 34:40.719
Because I think you know
exactly where she is.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.800
I tried to help her !

34:45.880 --> 34:48.120
I went up against
an oil company for her !

34:48.199 --> 34:51.440
Why would I want anything bad
to happen to her ? I have no motive.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.400
Jim, Jack, whatever the fuck
you call him,

34:54.480 --> 34:56.780
is a violent alcoholic
who slept with her.

34:56.860 --> 35:00.680
She ruined their marriage and then she
came back to then blackmail the wife.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.760
What are you trying to say ?

35:10.160 --> 35:12.720
Jack and Angela killed Jaclyn.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.340
Fuck.

36:17.100 --> 36:19.260
Jesus. Fuck.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.940
Hang on.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.300
Fucking hell.

36:48.060 --> 36:50.300
Fuck really...

36:52.060 --> 36:55.500
Hey, you alright ?

36:56.020 --> 36:57.780
Fine, my god.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.820
- Come on.
- Okay.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.620
You alright ?

37:08.900 --> 37:11.620
- Here.
- Thanks.

37:18.460 --> 37:21.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:21.140 --> 37:23.700
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

37:25.580 --> 37:28.060
I'm sorry, Rosa.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.100
What will you do now ?

37:34.380 --> 37:36.260
Protect you.

37:37.980 --> 37:40.740
- Protect us ?
- Yeah.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.060
Here. Take it.

37:54.860 --> 37:57.900
Go on. Take it. That's it.

38:00.020 --> 38:03.860
You show her, Anna.
You show her how to shoot him.

38:30.780 --> 38:33.740
Who else knows about this ?

38:34.860 --> 38:36.580
Only you.

38:40.060 --> 38:43.100
Has anyone contacted the police ?

38:47.300 --> 38:49.740
- No.
- Good.

38:53.900 --> 38:57.460
No one else must know
about this, Johan.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.280
I'm in debt to these men.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.220
They are criminals.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.380
The cattle is just the beginning.

39:07.300 --> 39:11.540
- We must tell everyone.
- If we tell them, they will leave.

39:11.620 --> 39:15.980
And if they leave,
the whole colony dies !

39:21.860 --> 39:26.060
I've given my life
to this place Johan.

39:26.140 --> 39:28.980
Prairie Field is all I have.

39:29.060 --> 39:33.020
If I lose this, I lose everything !

39:36.300 --> 39:38.060
I am an old man.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.060
I have nowhere else to go.

39:45.660 --> 39:48.460
So, what do we do, Friedrich ?

39:52.220 --> 39:54.980
We get rid of the damn thing.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.900
So how bad is it ?

39:59.980 --> 40:03.780
Number one, insurance company
suspects arson on your house.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.940
Number two, allegedly you have
a dead intelligence office

40:08.020 --> 40:11.500
buried in your back yard.
A Louis Gagnon ?

40:11.580 --> 40:15.260
And number three you have a motive.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.780
Jaclyn slept with your husband
and then blackmailed you for murder.

40:19.860 --> 40:22.580
So quite bad then.

40:22.660 --> 40:24.460
And to make matters worse,

40:24.660 --> 40:27.620
Elizabeth claims you assaulted
then forcibly confined her.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.380
- That's bullshit.
- There's evidence that someone did.

40:34.140 --> 40:38.100
Do you honestly think my mum and dad
would kill an innocent woman ?

40:43.700 --> 40:45.340
No.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.820
No chance of DNA then ?

40:56.900 --> 40:59.580
The body was covered in acid
from the septic tank.

40:59.660 --> 41:03.220
Yep. That's pretty nifty.

41:05.380 --> 41:09.180
No rich white woman is going to go
to jail for murdering a native woman.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.580
Especially if she says
that it's in self-defense.

41:11.660 --> 41:15.340
- Hundred percent.
- It's just the way it is.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.740
The justice system does not work
for native people.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.260
I need you to do something for me.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.780
Bet you do.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.900
You know what I'm asking
of you, right ?

41:37.980 --> 41:39.780
Yeah.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.940
What's going on, Jack ?
What the hell is going on ?

42:45.020 --> 42:47.220
You're going to have to tell me
at some point.

42:54.060 --> 42:56.580
- They're coming for us.
- Who ?

42:57.260 --> 43:01.100
- They're coming for all of us.
- Who's coming for all of us ?

43:07.380 --> 43:09.580
Jack ?

43:12.340 --> 43:13.740
Liverpool.

43:43.100 --> 43:46.120
I've accused the police chief
and his wife of killing someone.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.780
How long do you think I have
until they come after me ?

43:47.860 --> 43:49.780
Ex-police chief.

43:49.860 --> 43:54.060
And I can assure you even if he does
try something, he won't get past me.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.100
I saw how she treated you in there.
She treated you like you were an idiot.

44:01.820 --> 44:05.380
I know you're not, I know you know
the score. So please. Let me go.

44:05.460 --> 44:08.020
We can hold you for twenty-four
hours without charge.

44:08.100 --> 44:13.800
So that's another nine hours and thirty
some minutes before I can release you.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.460
But you don't actually think
I did this, do you ?

44:16.540 --> 44:20.140
- You think I tied myself up ?
- What I think is irrelevant.

44:20.220 --> 44:22.480
I'm a law man. I uphold the law.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.140
You think that's going to stop him ?

44:25.780 --> 44:27.700
This is a twelve-gauge
tactical shot gun

44:27.780 --> 44:29.940
filled with 3 inch slugs
that could take out a grizzly.

44:30.020 --> 44:33.540
More importantly,
it's got me holding it.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.860
We're both dead.

44:36.460 --> 44:38.980
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Constable McGill ?

44:39.100 --> 44:41.220
McGillen.

44:43.500 --> 44:44.980
I'm scared.

44:46.220 --> 44:48.460
I can see that.

44:48.540 --> 44:51.780
And I'm sympathetic. I truly am.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.620
- Then let me go.
- I can't.

44:53.700 --> 44:55.180
- You can.
- I can't.

44:55.260 --> 44:57.760
You can you could just go to the
bathroom. And I slip out quietly ...

44:57.840 --> 45:02.740
Yes. But I don't need
to go to the bathroom.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.700
Look, if it's any consolation,

45:07.780 --> 45:10.980
we McGillens are the oldest family
in Little Big Bear.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.980
Hell, we built the damn place.

45:13.060 --> 45:15.940
The McGillens ploughed the land,
we erected the first homesteads

45:16.020 --> 45:18.220
and built the church
on Twelfth Street.

45:18.300 --> 45:20.300
I mean we practically run this town.

45:20.380 --> 45:24.940
So if that two bit British hooligan
thinks he can just walk in here...

45:35.900 --> 45:37.180
Come on then.

45:38.220 --> 45:42.220
You piece of shit !
You're fucking kidding me.
