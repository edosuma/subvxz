WEBVTT

00:32.804 --> 00:33.971
Stop.

00:34.138 --> 00:36.389
Stop! I know you can totally hear me.

00:42.432 --> 00:44.057
Good morning, whore.

00:48.059 --> 00:50.186
Freeze. Put your hands in the air.

00:57.146 --> 01:01.355
Jameson LaCroix:
Weapons dealer, drug smuggler...

01:01.522 --> 01:03.397
...corpse.

01:11.526 --> 01:13.483
<i>And another one gone
And another one gone</i>

01:13.650 --> 01:15.401
<i>Another one bites the dust</i>

01:15.568 --> 01:17.485
<i>Hey, he's gonna get you too</i>

01:17.652 --> 01:20.279
<i>Another one bites the dust</i>

01:20.445 --> 01:23.946
Well done, Smith.
This brings your kill total up to 14.

01:24.113 --> 01:26.614
And it means
you get to pick tomorrow's lunch.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.197
Quiznos. I choose Quiznos.

01:28.364 --> 01:30.781
Are you sure?
We have many new takeout menus.

01:30.948 --> 01:32.908
<i>Toasted bread and melted cheese,
Quiznos.</i>

01:33.074 --> 01:35.367
<i>Toasted bread and melted cheese,
Quiznos.</i>

01:38.034 --> 01:39.784
- Was he in pain?
- Did his guts spill?

01:39.951 --> 01:41.327
How long will he be dead?

01:45.162 --> 01:48.704
Sorry, boys, I don't kill and tell.
Part of the killers' code.

01:48.871 --> 01:51.955
I bet he sees his victims' faces
every time he closes his eyes.

01:52.122 --> 01:56.582
And I bet they're all like, "Why?"
And he's all like, "You know why."

01:56.749 --> 02:00.374
Stan has replaced Rutger Hauer
on my wall and in my heart.

02:00.541 --> 02:03.168
You guys are pathetic.
You're idolizing a murderer.

02:03.335 --> 02:05.668
Oh, yeah? Well:

02:07.794 --> 02:10.295
- What the hell does that mean?
- Guy humor, Hayley.

02:10.461 --> 02:13.837
You don't got a willy,
you don't get the silly.

02:14.004 --> 02:15.422
Dad, speaking of guy stuff...

02:15.588 --> 02:18.673
...we were all talking about trying out
for the gymnastics team.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.924
- I'll kill you if you do.
- He totally will too. He's so awesome.

02:22.091 --> 02:23.549
Kids, leave your father alone.

02:23.716 --> 02:28.301
The last thing he wants to do
is relive every vivid, gruesome detail.

02:28.468 --> 02:32.844
Save that for the bedroom,
my big, powerful killer.

02:33.011 --> 02:36.720
You know I likes to get with the ladies,
but I have to take a rain check.

02:36.887 --> 02:39.263
I'm playing poker
with a couple guys from work.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.472
We need a fourth,
so Chilly's coming along.

02:41.638 --> 02:43.639
- Chilly?
- You heard right, baby.

02:43.806 --> 02:47.349
They call me Chilly
because I got ice in my veins.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.975
What's with these cards, Bad Larry?
You're screwing me with these cards.

02:51.142 --> 02:52.392
Why can't I stop sweating?

02:52.559 --> 02:54.727
I'm sorry, Chilly.
I don't control the cards.

02:54.894 --> 02:58.394
If I did, I'd give you
the best goshdarn ones there were.

02:58.561 --> 03:01.103
Bad Larry,
your wife made this guacamole?

03:01.270 --> 03:04.480
Usually the ugly ones can cook.

03:04.646 --> 03:07.397
Ray. You're honest
because you're old.

03:07.564 --> 03:09.564
So how do you and Stan
know each other?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.857
From work.
We know each other from work.

03:12.024 --> 03:14.858
- That's where we know him from.
- Then from the coffee shop.

03:15.025 --> 03:19.693
- I don't know. I'm trying to play a hand.
- Hey, Smith, mazel tov on the kill today.

03:19.860 --> 03:23.152
- What'd you have to eat after?
- I don't know.

03:23.319 --> 03:25.612
You don't know?
What the hell's wrong with you?

03:25.779 --> 03:29.238
I remember every meal I ate
after every kill.

03:29.405 --> 03:32.781
Whose deal is it? Come on.
I'm in a big hole here. Huge, huge hole.

03:32.947 --> 03:36.907
Madonna, circa 1986.
I'm in Madonna, circa 1986.

03:37.074 --> 03:39.116
Johnny Damone was my first kill.

03:39.283 --> 03:43.285
Slit his throat with a coping saw,
then ate an egg-salad sandwich.

03:43.452 --> 03:45.576
It was too big. I took home half.

03:45.743 --> 03:48.827
Yeah, you never forget your first.
Mine was my old partner, Joe.

03:48.994 --> 03:51.245
Turned out he was working
for the East Germans.

03:51.412 --> 03:55.247
While I was strangling him, I stuck my
thumb in his eye and popped his eye out.

03:55.414 --> 03:59.831
Without severing the nerve, I turned it
around so he could watch himself die.

03:59.998 --> 04:02.957
My God, Bad Larry.

04:03.124 --> 04:05.167
One time, can I get a hand?

04:05.334 --> 04:08.084
What about you, Stan?
Who was your first?

04:08.250 --> 04:10.627
Now, I'm a gentleman.
I never kill and tell.

04:10.794 --> 04:14.086
Oh, come on. It's just us guys.

04:14.253 --> 04:18.130
Okay. I shot a guy.

04:18.463 --> 04:20.963
Who? Come on. We want details.

04:21.130 --> 04:25.465
It was this Russian spy. You guys
don't know him. He was from Canada.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.883
Oh, yeah? Where'd you shoot him?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.842
- In the body.
- Where in the body?

04:30.009 --> 04:34.718
The front. The front of the body.

04:35.635 --> 04:38.553
Hey, how about
when you kill someone dead...

04:38.720 --> 04:42.762
...and then afterwards,
your hands smell like wet dog?

04:42.929 --> 04:43.971
Wet dog?

04:44.137 --> 04:47.806
Well, you know what I mean.
Something dog. Whose deal is it?

04:48.223 --> 04:50.933
You didn't kill anyone today.

04:51.098 --> 04:54.849
I don't think you've ever killed anyone.

04:55.016 --> 04:58.059
What are you...?
I've totally killed people.

04:58.226 --> 05:00.602
Hey, anyone notice
that Chilly is really an alien?

05:00.769 --> 05:03.102
- You're a virgin.
- I am not a virgin.

05:03.269 --> 05:07.145
Big, macho Stan is a killing virgin.

05:07.312 --> 05:10.688
You never popped your cherry.

05:11.481 --> 05:13.357
- No. L... l...
- He never...

05:13.523 --> 05:15.357
My soufflÃ©.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.441
Well, he's my ride,
so I should get going too.

05:18.608 --> 05:22.234
It's probably a good thing since
I've been getting complete crap all nigh...

05:22.400 --> 05:23.443
- Who's in?
- Fold.

05:23.610 --> 05:24.652
- Fold.
- Damn it.

05:30.654 --> 05:32.654
Don't look at me. I'm a disgrace.

05:32.820 --> 05:37.697
Come on, Stan. Get in the car.
We have to talk about what happened.

05:40.865 --> 05:43.157
Now, should I have folded
that pair of threes?

05:43.324 --> 05:45.367
Roger, I've never killed anyone.

05:45.534 --> 05:48.451
Don't you wanna know
how that's possible?

05:48.618 --> 05:52.285
Yeah, sure. We can talk about
your thing first, I guess.

05:52.452 --> 05:56.329
It all started when I was a rookie agent
20 years ago.

05:56.496 --> 06:01.122
I'd been following this spy for months,
and finally had him cornered.

06:14.585 --> 06:17.835
Sorry, folks. Spilled my beer. Sorry.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.504
What are you doing?

06:20.671 --> 06:23.088
Don't shoot me in the stomach.
That's stupid.

06:23.255 --> 06:24.838
It probably won't even kill me.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.090
Is this your first time or something?

06:30.257 --> 06:32.466
Oh, my God, it is.

06:32.633 --> 06:36.218
Well, you're terrible at it.
You are terrible.

06:36.384 --> 06:39.093
And you'll never be any good. Never.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.552
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't pull the trigger.

06:42.719 --> 06:45.470
I just froze up.

06:53.306 --> 06:57.891
I took credit for the kill, but since then,
I've never been able to do the deed.

06:58.058 --> 07:00.226
But I thought
you've killed a bunch of people.

07:00.393 --> 07:02.101
Not exactly.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.024
Yep, I still got it.

07:23.191 --> 07:26.234
Hey, you're that virgin from the subway.
How you been, virgin?

07:26.401 --> 07:30.235
I've been up and down myself.
Sweet Lady Cancer took one of my nads.

07:30.735 --> 07:34.570
Everyone thought I was
this badass CIA agent, so I went with it.

07:34.737 --> 07:38.862
And that's who I became.
For myself, my wife and my kids.

07:39.029 --> 07:42.072
Roger, they can never find out the truth.
They'd be devastated.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.740
Hey, don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

07:44.907 --> 07:48.282
Look, I'll tell you one of mine
so we're even.

07:48.449 --> 07:54.243
I return stuff to the Gap all the time.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.370
- Liar! Your whole life has been a lie!
- Damn it, Roger.

08:01.537 --> 08:04.038
You're not a killer of men,
you're a killer of truth.

08:04.205 --> 08:06.789
- Steve, it's not...
- You made me look like a real jerk.

08:06.956 --> 08:09.707
I'm a jerk. You know what it's like
to be made a jerk of?

08:09.873 --> 08:12.416
I've been walking around
wondering who the jerk is...

08:12.582 --> 08:14.458
...and then, bam, I'm the jerk.

08:14.625 --> 08:17.751
You made me a jerk, Pop.
Aren't we a fine pair?

08:17.918 --> 08:20.210
The jerk
and the guy that made him a jerk.

08:20.377 --> 08:23.544
Oh, Daddy, I just knew
you couldn't be a cold-blooded killer.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.545
- I'm so proud of you.
- No.

08:25.712 --> 08:28.547
Why don't you come with me
to the Citizens' Protest Caucus?

08:28.712 --> 08:31.506
Together,
we'll pick blueberries for peace.

08:31.673 --> 08:35.090
- I loved you.
- Everyone, just relax.

08:35.256 --> 08:37.133
So Stan hasn't killed anyone.

08:37.298 --> 08:39.716
He's still the same person
he was last night.

08:39.883 --> 08:42.217
It's just our opinion of him
that's changed.

08:47.136 --> 08:51.762
- You told them I'm a killing virgin?
- Stan, come on. I'm a gossip.

08:51.929 --> 08:56.431
I reveal people's darkest secrets
so I can seem momentarily interesting.

08:56.597 --> 09:00.223
You know who else does that? Hayley.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.808
- What are you guys doing here?
- Chilly called us.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.058
You can't go on being a virgin.

09:05.225 --> 09:09.352
Which is why we're gonna take you out
and get you your first kill.

09:09.518 --> 09:13.228
And you'll be doing your killing
with this.

09:17.521 --> 09:22.355
No? All right, then everyone scoot back.
I gotta whack this thing on the ground.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.024
I don't know about this, guys.

09:27.191 --> 09:30.234
Hey, pal, relax. We brought you
to the best place in town.

09:31.609 --> 09:35.402
Inside are the most pathetic people
in the city, with nothing to live for.

09:35.569 --> 09:37.694
It's like Applebee's with a bar.

09:37.861 --> 09:40.612
Oh, wait, Applebee's has a bar.
It's like Applebee's.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.489
Stan, look who I met at the bar.
This is Gladys.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.574
She's 46. Never been married,
despite years of trying.

09:51.740 --> 09:55.617
Had a hysterectomy, so even
if she does find that special someone...

09:55.784 --> 09:58.617
...there's no chance she'll have kids.
You should kill her.

09:59.368 --> 10:05.704
I can't. She's too tall.
I don't wanna kill anyone too tall.

10:05.996 --> 10:09.454
Everyone, this is James. I found him
curled up under the dart machine...

10:09.621 --> 10:11.247
...smelling of urine and despair.

10:11.414 --> 10:14.164
His sport jacket, as you can see,
is made of newspapers.

10:14.331 --> 10:17.125
He keeps mumbling that he'd rather die
than pay alimony...

10:17.292 --> 10:19.958
...which, in my book, is a green light.

10:20.125 --> 10:24.543
You guys want me to shoot a guy
named James? As in Jim?

10:24.710 --> 10:29.087
Like Jim Davis, the guy who opened up
his heart and gave us Garfield?

10:29.254 --> 10:34.088
<i>This is Mark.
He created that TV show Quintuplets.</i>

10:34.255 --> 10:37.381
Me liked the one
where they went to prom.

10:37.548 --> 10:39.716
That one was terrible.
They were all terrible.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.341
That was awful.
I can't stand the whole bar scene.

10:45.508 --> 10:49.218
Hey, it was your first night out there.
You'll find the right one soon.

10:49.385 --> 10:52.261
- Well, how will I know it's the right one?
- Oh, you'll know.

10:52.428 --> 10:54.803
When you find the one,
you just know.

10:54.970 --> 10:59.805
You seem awfully knowledgeable
about all this. Have you ever...?

10:59.972 --> 11:02.431
- Well, I served in the war.
- There was a space war?

11:02.598 --> 11:03.640
Space war?

11:03.807 --> 11:06.849
No, no. I fought for the Vietcong
in the late '60s.

11:07.016 --> 11:10.350
I've told you that story, right?
Well, the end of it is we won.

11:11.809 --> 11:15.311
- Steve, what are you doing?
- Drinking beer in my underwear.

11:15.477 --> 11:18.060
Put that down
and go put on some clothes this instant.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.145
Or you can shut up!

11:21.437 --> 11:24.230
This is a little uncomfortable.

11:26.189 --> 11:27.231
There we are.

11:27.398 --> 11:29.815
I'm your father.
You can't talk to me that way.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.691
Yeah? What you gonna do, kill me?

11:33.317 --> 11:36.776
- Maybe Steve is your one.
- I can't kill my own son.

11:36.942 --> 11:38.402
Yeah, that's what I thought.

11:38.569 --> 11:42.360
Now I refer you back
to my previous statement, shut up!

11:42.527 --> 11:45.945
- Get the door.
- Boy, he is rough on you.

11:46.112 --> 11:50.531
He is elephant-making-love-to-a-cat
rough on you.

11:52.488 --> 11:54.197
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.

11:54.364 --> 11:57.283
My name's Randy. I just moved in
with my mom down the street.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.200
I'm throwing empties at your head.

11:59.366 --> 12:01.451
I was recently released from prison...

12:01.617 --> 12:05.410
...and the law requires me to tell
everyone within a two-mile radius...

12:05.577 --> 12:07.661
...that I'm a registered sex offender.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.412
I threw peanuts at you.

12:09.579 --> 12:13.621
I used to work over at the water park,
where I molested a ton of kids.

12:13.788 --> 12:17.122
But now I'm out,
so we'll see what happens.

12:17.289 --> 12:20.415
Sorry, my mind's a million miles away.
Now, what are you selling?

12:20.582 --> 12:23.708
Hey, shut the door.
You're letting all the air out.

12:25.126 --> 12:27.250
So smooth. Can I come in?

12:27.417 --> 12:30.626
I would very much like to come in.
I would like to be in your home.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.879
Chicken strips on a TV tray
in five minutes...

12:35.046 --> 12:36.713
...or I'm kicking your ass!

12:38.755 --> 12:40.921
Hey, killer. How was the kill?

12:41.088 --> 12:43.089
You need to wash the blood
off your hands?

12:43.256 --> 12:44.715
Oh, better yet, don't.

12:44.882 --> 12:48.091
Well, I didn't actually kill anyone.
I tried to...

12:48.258 --> 12:50.967
I'm tired. I have a headache.
I have a lot of work to do.

12:51.133 --> 12:54.843
My back hurts. It's that time
of the month. I have an early meeting.

12:55.010 --> 12:56.594
That's my pencil sharpener.

12:56.761 --> 13:01.305
Just sharpening my pencils
for my meeting tomorrow.

13:03.013 --> 13:07.598
All right, Stan. Now, don't be nervous.
This place is a sure thing.

13:07.765 --> 13:09.390
I'm gonna do it this time, guys.

13:09.557 --> 13:12.391
Good. Now, if you start to get nervous,
picture them naked.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.475
You start to get really nervous,
make them get naked.

13:15.641 --> 13:17.267
Still nervous, you get naked.

13:17.434 --> 13:20.852
You can do whatever you want.
You're killing these people.

13:21.019 --> 13:22.895
Oh, good, you're here. Come on in.

13:23.729 --> 13:26.145
We're in bit of a hurry.
We have to catch a comet.

13:26.312 --> 13:28.563
Now, according to the laws
of Zargon...

13:28.730 --> 13:30.980
...we need an outsider
to deliver the poison...

13:31.147 --> 13:34.356
...which will return us to our planet.
You must be the chosen ones.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.107
You were the first
to reply to our post on Craigslist.

13:37.274 --> 13:40.859
- How awesome is Craigslist?
- That's how I met my hiking buddy.

13:41.026 --> 13:42.860
And that bitch who stole all my stuff.

13:43.026 --> 13:46.278
Okay, now, which one of you
will be releasing us to freedom?

13:46.444 --> 13:47.987
Our boy Stan, right here.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.322
Is there a problem?

13:55.489 --> 13:57.114
- What are you waiting for?
- Hurry.

13:57.281 --> 13:59.449
Is this the first time
you've poisoned people?

13:59.615 --> 14:01.699
Come on, do it, do it, do it!

14:03.158 --> 14:07.326
Right now is my acting class.
I'm letting down my scene partner.

14:08.035 --> 14:12.494
So I like your shower caps.
Sells "crazy" right away.

14:14.703 --> 14:16.954
There you are.
I've been calling your cell.

14:17.121 --> 14:21.206
I got you a part in a snuff film.
You'll be killing Stacy Keach.

14:21.372 --> 14:23.539
Oh, what is this? I don't get this.

14:23.706 --> 14:27.166
I was picking blueberries for peace
with my daughter. Who was I kidding?

14:27.333 --> 14:31.168
I'm a wimpy non-killer who doesn't have
the guts to end another human's life.

14:31.334 --> 14:35.418
I'll set up the juicer
so we can make empathy smoothies.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.629
I see you've noticed our unitards.
We're trying out for gymnastics.

14:40.795 --> 14:44.464
That's right,
I'm defying you with a handspring.

14:52.174 --> 14:55.759
Good luck. Wish me luck
on bottling my own preserves.

14:55.926 --> 14:57.842
- My blueberries.
- Look at yourself.

14:58.009 --> 14:59.343
Look at what you've become.

14:59.510 --> 15:01.886
You're not gonna find the one
picking blueberries.

15:02.053 --> 15:05.804
Give it up, Roger. There is no "one."
That person doesn't exist.

15:05.970 --> 15:10.180
No "one" is just gonna
magically fall into my lap.

15:23.726 --> 15:28.436
That's it. That's the one.
The guy who came to my house.

15:28.603 --> 15:32.479
This whole time, I was going out looking
for it when it was down the street...

15:32.646 --> 15:35.480
<i>...living with its mother
and watching The Sandlot on DVD.</i>

15:35.647 --> 15:37.147
- Stan?
- It was right there...

15:37.314 --> 15:38.773
...and I couldn't even see it.

15:38.940 --> 15:41.858
- Stan?
- I guess that's why it's perfect.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.900
You don't even realize it's happening...

15:44.067 --> 15:45.108
- Stan!
- What?

15:45.275 --> 15:47.984
Steve just rode away
in that pedophile's ice-cream truck.

15:48.151 --> 15:51.819
Oh, my God.
He had ice cream at lunch.

15:58.071 --> 15:59.197
Are you Randy's mother?

15:59.363 --> 16:01.739
I need to find your son.
He drove off with my boy.

16:01.906 --> 16:06.366
Oh, dear. Randy used to work
at the water park before the troubles.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.574
You might wanna check there.

16:08.741 --> 16:11.284
He also kills cats!

16:11.450 --> 16:13.284
So...

16:13.743 --> 16:14.827
...you know.

16:22.412 --> 16:25.330
What an awesome place.
Thanks for bringing us, Randy.

16:25.497 --> 16:28.415
No problem. Hey, do you kids
sometimes kiss your pillow...

16:28.582 --> 16:31.248
...and pretend
it's one of the Little Rascals?

16:31.415 --> 16:33.166
- No.
- Me neither.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.501
How would you
like to see the old mattress...

16:35.667 --> 16:38.001
...in my secret spy lair
behind the waterfall?

16:38.168 --> 16:39.418
Yeah.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.628
I need a ticket.
My son is about to be molested.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.588
- Sixty-five dollars.
- Sixty-five? That's outrageous.

16:47.754 --> 16:50.673
If you have a soda can,
you get in for half price.

17:07.551 --> 17:10.470
I hope my son's still
about to be molested. I need a ticket.

17:10.637 --> 17:14.097
I'm sorry, I can't accept a full can.
It has to be empty.

17:28.643 --> 17:32.103
Polar bears shouldn't give this
to their babies.

17:33.311 --> 17:36.604
All right, clear a path.
Some people work for a living.

17:36.771 --> 17:39.398
- You guys need tickets.
- CIA.

17:39.563 --> 17:41.480
Wow, that bums me out.

17:41.647 --> 17:44.315
Perry-Ellis-wallet owner.
Out of my way.

17:44.482 --> 17:45.899
Chilly told us what happened.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.400
- We got here as soon as we could.
- Find the boys.

17:48.566 --> 17:51.068
There's not a moment to lose.

17:51.651 --> 17:54.568
Sanchez Montezuma, INS,
Churro and Sopaipilla Division.

17:54.735 --> 17:57.236
I'm confiscating all these churros.

17:57.403 --> 17:59.529
And a milk, please.

18:02.154 --> 18:04.988
See? Isn't playing Popcorn fun?

18:05.155 --> 18:07.364
- Something doesn't seem right here.
- Yeah.

18:07.531 --> 18:10.533
At the very least,
we should have popped by now.

18:10.698 --> 18:14.325
I'm the salt. All kernels
have to wrestle me to get salted.

18:20.953 --> 18:23.703
- Freeze, dirtbag.
- Dad.

18:24.912 --> 18:30.038
- It's all over, Randy. Time to die.
- Okay, yeah. I get it.

18:31.622 --> 18:34.998
Aren't you...? Aren't you gonna apologize
and beg for your life?

18:35.165 --> 18:38.874
No. Look, I'm a sex offender.
I love offensive sex.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.084
I offend people with the sex I have.

18:41.251 --> 18:43.751
That's who I am
and that's who I'll always be.

18:44.252 --> 18:48.795
My God, boys. We can all take a page
from Randy the molester's book.

18:48.962 --> 18:53.046
He's comfortable with who he is,
and I should be as well.

18:53.213 --> 18:58.340
So I'm not a killer. If it happens for me,
and I kill someone, great. If not, fine.

18:58.507 --> 19:00.675
But it's not going to be
what defines me.

19:00.841 --> 19:04.591
I don't need to kill someone to prove
anything to you, myself or anyone else.

19:04.758 --> 19:08.093
Thanks for saving us.
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

19:08.260 --> 19:13.136
Just because you haven't killed anyone
doesn't mean you're not a great dad.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.929
Yeah. That's nice.

19:16.096 --> 19:18.304
You're going away
for a long time, Randy.

19:18.471 --> 19:21.181
- Not as long as you might think.
- What do you mean?

19:21.348 --> 19:24.057
I've got a great lawyer,
and my mom's got a ton of money.

19:24.224 --> 19:27.099
I'll be back out on the streets
in no time.

19:27.891 --> 19:30.684
I don't think so.

19:36.061 --> 19:38.769
Once again, Bad Larry, I am so sorry.

19:38.936 --> 19:42.021
I can't believe you fired a shot
that completely missed Randy...

19:42.187 --> 19:46.731
...and went through the waterfall, hitting
Bad Larry who was on the other side.

19:46.898 --> 19:50.774
What? I'm just trying to make sure
we're all clear.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.275
I'm not gonna make it.

19:54.441 --> 19:57.943
See, Stan? It was me all along.

19:58.110 --> 20:00.569
I was your one,
and you didn't even know it.

20:01.235 --> 20:05.112
- Bad Larry.
- Hey, hey, no tears, you.

20:05.279 --> 20:09.281
I am one bad Bad Larry.

20:10.865 --> 20:14.824
I'll never forget you, Bad Larry.
You'll always be my first.

20:14.990 --> 20:17.449
I'm... I'm glad it was me.

20:17.616 --> 20:24.159
And I shall become more powerful
than you could possibly imagine.

20:25.077 --> 20:28.828
- What'd he mean by that?
- Who cares? He's dead.

20:29.370 --> 20:34.413
I know it's just a corn dog,
but you'll never forget it.

20:37.123 --> 20:39.873
Where did I park my car?

20:43.834 --> 20:48.126
Daddy. You're just in time to go with me
to pick raspberries for justice.

20:48.293 --> 20:52.211
Go to hell, Hayley. That's not who I am.
Take off that unitard, or I'll kill you.

20:52.378 --> 20:54.878
- You so would.
- Did you kill someone?

20:55.045 --> 20:57.422
- Yep.
- Did you wash the blood off your hands?

20:57.588 --> 21:02.381
I sure didn't, honey. I sure didn't.

21:04.173 --> 21:07.883
Here it is. My big chance.
Last line of the show.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.758
I've got an area.
Something about Rutger Hauer.

21:10.925 --> 21:13.843
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
No. No, Fox local news. No!

21:49.897 --> 21:51.981
