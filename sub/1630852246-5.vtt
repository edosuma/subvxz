21:49.125 --> 21:51.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Ched.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.083
No, Ched's right.

21:53.166 --> 21:54.875
What I did was weird.

21:54.958 --> 21:56.041
It's coo.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.875
Look, I've been selfish.

21:58.958 --> 22:01.416
I… I was throwing a pity party
for myself.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.208
But now, I've seen
that we've all been through stuff.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.666
Baby girl, you're right. We've--

22:07.750 --> 22:10.875
"We've all been through stuff."
Yeah, obvi, Horse.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.791
Glad we could be of service
to you on your journey, Horse.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.916
I mean, not all of us.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.958
Come on!

22:17.041 --> 22:21.583
You wouldn't believe what's in here.
Do it. Do it now!

22:21.666 --> 22:22.500
Please.

22:23.250 --> 22:26.833
Horsey… Horsey, dear.
So you're on board with the hootenanny?

22:26.916 --> 22:27.750
Yeah.

22:28.416 --> 22:31.458
Is it too late for me
to be the Scrunch-master?

22:31.541 --> 22:32.916
Of course not!

22:33.000 --> 22:36.166
Durpleton, can you see about
finding us a new Sflü?

22:38.166 --> 22:39.625
I got more mulch!

22:39.708 --> 22:41.833
Sflü's still broken, ya tree-bag.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.583
Aw, nuts to this.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.666
[Zulius] Okay, I'll tell you!

22:48.750 --> 22:52.166
I have a traumatic backstory. Picture it!

22:52.250 --> 22:55.708
[Zulius] Me, younger, basically this.
[chuckling]

22:55.791 --> 22:57.458
There was an alley… [gasps]

22:57.541 --> 22:58.833
…and a top hat.

22:58.916 --> 23:00.791
Pearls for days!

23:00.875 --> 23:03.000
[closing theme music playing]

23:32.625 --> 23:34.541
[Horse galloping]

23:34.625 --> 23:36.625
[neighing]

23:37.333 --> 23:39.333
[whimsical music playing]
