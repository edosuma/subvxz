murdered this time murdered by a warlock.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.626
In this time of

you're a Herondale?

10:52.932 --> 10:54.565

of the Shadow World?

10:54.601 --> 10:56.645
It's an old Shadowhunter family.
Like the Lightwoods.

10:56.669 --> 10:57.902

10:57.937 --> 10:59.804
Let's focus on what matters.

to reach out to our allies,

At this point,

11:03.543 --> 11:05.476

Downworlders suspects.

11:05.511 --> 11:06.822
That's casting a
pretty broad net.

11:06.846 --> 11:08.891
She can't possibly think
any of our friends did this.

11:08.915 --> 11:10.548
Yeah, well,
we'll prove that to her.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.750
Since Luke's DNA cleared him,
we should collect samples

11:12.785 --> 11:14.652
from all of our friends
to clear them as well.

11:14.687 --> 11:16.487

with Raphael if it's just me.

I'll leave as soon
as Max is settled.

Mr. Lightwood,
perhaps your personal relationships

Maybe they have
everything to do with it,

because it was a warlock who
told me to always follow my gut,

19:40.553 --> 19:41.697

27:31.548 --> 27:32.758
I can tell you
it's not a vampire.

27:32.782 --> 27:35.617
We would never remove
runes from a Shadowhunter.

27:35.652 --> 27:36.652

27:38.555 --> 27:40.655
From the time
before the Accords,

27:40.690 --> 27:44.592
the Downworlders were hunted
by Shadowhunters for sport.

27:44.628 --> 27:48.630
They took our fangs, werewolf
claws, and warlock marks

27:48.665 --> 27:51.366
as trophies. The vampires swore

27:51.401 --> 27:53.701
we would never let that happen again.
To anyone.

27:53.737 --> 27:56.638
That's horrible...

the Downworld came together

to make some demands the
Clave wouldn't agree to.

28:28.505 --> 28:30.405
And it got pretty ugly.

the Shadowhunters' respect

dangerous we are.
