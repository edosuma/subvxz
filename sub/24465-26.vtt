07:02.080 --> 07:03.140
MESSAGING ââ WHAT THE?

07:03.240 --> 07:04.300
IS THAT YOU, MORDECAI?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.620
Mordecai: OH, HEY.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.500
HEY, YOU GUYS.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.420
HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

07:07.520 --> 07:08.660
OH, YOU KNOW.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.340
OH, HEY, OUR BAND PUT OUT A DEMO

07:10.440 --> 07:11.780
TAPE.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.780
Mordecai: OH, COOL.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.300
IT'S SORT OF AN AMBIENT

07:14.400 --> 07:15.300
PROGâROCK FUSION.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.340
YOU CAN KEEP THAT.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.640
WE HAD TO MOVE ON AFTER YOU
DIDN'T CALL.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.380
Mordecai: UH, THAT'S ALL

07:19.480 --> 07:19.940
RIGHT ââ

07:20.040 --> 07:23.040
ENOUGH REMINISCING!
YOU STAND ACCUSED OF BREAKING

07:22.600 --> 07:24.740
THE GOLDEN RULE OF TEXTING ââ

07:24.840 --> 07:26.780
SENDING THE SAME TEXT MESSAGE

07:26.880 --> 07:27.740
THREE TIMES.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.580
AND THAT'S THE WORST THING

07:29.680 --> 07:30.580
IN THE WORLD!

07:30.680 --> 07:31.580
Mordecai: WHAT? WHY?

07:31.680 --> 07:34.020
IT'S SUPER ANNOYING!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.260
YES, AND SOME OF US HAVE VERY

07:36.360 --> 07:37.580
LIMITED DATA PLANS.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.260
Rigby: UH, WELL, HE'S REALLY

07:39.360 --> 07:41.760
SORRY.
Mordecai: I'M REALLY SORRY!

07:41.080 --> 07:44.280
Rigby: IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
SO IF YOU COULD JUST SHOW US THE

07:43.480 --> 07:43.940
WAY OUT.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.140
BURN THEM!

07:45.240 --> 07:46.060
( SIGHS )

07:46.160 --> 07:47.060
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.860
THIS IS YOUR SECOND OFFENSE!

07:48.960 --> 07:50.860
YOU WON'T BE GETTING OFF SO EASY

07:50.960 --> 07:53.400
THIS TIME!
Mordecai: I JUST PRESSED THE

07:52.800 --> 07:55.320
WRONG BUTTON!
YOU DON'T PRESS THE WRONG

07:54.960 --> 07:56.460
BUTTON THREE TIMES IN A ROW.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.020
Mordecai: LISTEN, I'M ââ

07:58.120 --> 08:00.700
I JUST REALLY GOT TO GO, OKAY?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.300
Rigby: WHAT?

08:02.400 --> 08:03.700
TELL US WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.220
Mordecai: NAH, I'M JUST...

08:05.320 --> 08:06.620
YOU KNOW...

08:06.720 --> 08:08.100
GOING THIS WAY...

08:08.200 --> 08:11.280
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING?!

08:09.600 --> 08:10.780
Rigby: DUDE, YOU'RE BEING

08:10.880 --> 08:14.220
REALLY WEIRD!

08:14.320 --> 08:16.180
MORDECAI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

08:16.280 --> 08:16.900
COME BACK!

08:17.000 --> 08:18.500
YOU'D RATHER FLOAT TOWARDS

08:18.600 --> 08:21.960
THE INFINITE ABYSS THAN TALK
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.660
THIS IS A SAFE PLACE!

08:22.760 --> 08:26.000
WHAT ARE YOU FLOATING AWAY
FROM?

08:24.560 --> 08:25.740
Mordecai: I...I DON'T WANT TO

08:25.840 --> 08:26.700
TALK ABOUT IT!

08:26.800 --> 08:28.460
DO YOU NOT WISH TO BE WITH

08:28.560 --> 08:29.260
THIS C.J.?

08:29.360 --> 08:30.940
HER TEXTING HISTORY SHOWS SHE'S

08:31.040 --> 08:34.560
QUITE THE WITTY AND INDEPENDENT
YOUNG WOMAN.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.060
AND SHE'S QUITE FOND OF YOU.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.660
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE FOR

08:38.760 --> 08:41.080
YOU.
LITERALLY NOTHING!

08:41.000 --> 08:43.500
IT'S REALLY BORING. TRUST ME.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.660
Mordecai: ( SIGHS )

08:46.760 --> 08:48.580
I REALLY DO LIKE C.J.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.740
Rigby: PFT! DUH, YOU DO.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.840
Mordecai: I'M JUST AFRAID
OF WHAT'LL HAPPEN BECAUSE...

08:51.800 --> 08:52.660
( SIGHS )

08:52.760 --> 08:55.600
...PART OF ME IS STILL WAITING
FOR MARGARET TO COME BACK.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.060
DADDY'S GIRL?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.180
Rigby: WHAT?! STILL?!

08:57.280 --> 09:00.520
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK, DUDE!
SHE'S GONE!

08:59.200 --> 09:00.260
Mordecai: LOOK, I KNOW!

09:00.360 --> 09:00.940
ALL RIGHT?

09:01.040 --> 09:01.780
I KNOW!

09:01.880 --> 09:02.900
IT'S JUST...

09:03.000 --> 09:04.580
I MEAN, I DON'T STILL HAVE

09:04.680 --> 09:05.700
FEELINGS FOR HER.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.540
BUT I DO IN A WAY.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.820
IT'S LIKE THIS THING THAT'S

09:08.920 --> 09:10.380
INSIDE OF ME, AND IT'S ALWAYS

09:10.480 --> 09:13.720
JUST SORT OF SITTING THERE,
WAITING AROUND, AND SOMETIMES

09:13.240 --> 09:16.680
I'LL SEE SOMETHING OR I'LL SMELL
SOMETHING, AND IT MAKES ME THINK

09:16.280 --> 09:17.620
OF HER, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT

09:17.720 --> 09:18.060
TO.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.420
I REALLY LIKE C.J.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.780
SHE'S AMAZING!

09:20.880 --> 09:22.180
BUT IS IT FAIR FOR ME TO GO OUT

09:22.280 --> 09:23.820
WITH HER IF I STILL THINK ABOUT

09:23.920 --> 09:25.020
MARGARET SOMETIMES?

09:25.120 --> 09:26.300
Rigby: DUDE, C.J.'s WAY

09:26.400 --> 09:29.360
COOLER THAN MARGARET.
WAY COOLER.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.020
I AGREE.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.620
THIS IS A NORMAL PART OF

09:30.720 --> 09:31.020
LIFE.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.740
WHERE ONE PHONE CALL ENDS,

09:32.840 --> 09:34.340
ANOTHER BEGINS.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.500
EVEN IF YOU DON'T LEAVE A

09:35.600 --> 09:38.680
MESSAGE AFTER THE BEEP.
Mordecai: SO WHAT SHOULD I

09:37.840 --> 09:38.340
DO?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.500
THAT'S FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.340
( WHIRRING )

09:42.440 --> 09:44.180
UH, ALSO, IF YOU HAVE A MUSIC

09:44.280 --> 09:45.820
BLOG OR SOMETHING, WE COULD

09:45.920 --> 09:47.180
REALLY USE SOME POSITIVE

09:47.280 --> 09:47.860
REVIEWS.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.820
Mordecai: UH...

09:48.920 --> 09:49.740
Rigby: YEAH...

09:49.840 --> 09:52.420
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.540
THIS IS IT GUYS.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.640
THIS IS GONNA BE OUR BIG BREAK.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.680
Rigby: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT
THIS?

10:06.560 --> 10:09.360
Mordecai: I'M TIRED OF
PULLING A MORDECAI.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.440
Rigby: NICE!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.840
Mordecai: YEAH!
Rigby: AWESOME!

10:20.560 --> 10:23.600
Mordecai: WAIT, WHAT DOES A
WINKY FACE MEââ

10:22.360 --> 10:23.460
"THAT MEANS YES.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.660
DON'T MISINTERPRET IT."

10:24.760 --> 10:26.220
HA HA! ALL RIGHT!

10:26.320 --> 10:28.140
"SEE YOU SOON."

10:28.240 --> 10:29.540
Rigby: I'M PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.980
EXTREME YUâJUMP!

10:32.080 --> 10:34.360
WHOOâHOOOOOO!
