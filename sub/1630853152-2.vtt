WEBVTT

00:36.245 --> 00:37.579
Finally!

00:37.663 --> 00:40.249
Couldn't face the idea of black tea.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.460
You know it's a crime.
It's an absolute fucking crime.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.671
Mate, I am a thirsty boy.

00:45.754 --> 00:49.800
No, no. Hang on. Hang on. Not in those.
They're all cold and stewed, aren't they?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.009
Why'd you leave 'em out then?

00:51.093 --> 00:53.095
Because I thought you'd be quicker,
didn't I?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.888
I had to go right down the high street.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.475
Well, you know there's a corner shop
the other way, you dozy twat.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.352
Marek wouldn't like that.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.436
Who's Marek?

01:01.520 --> 01:04.772
Spark we used to work with on the sites.
Polish.

01:04.857 --> 01:08.277
Milk first and then tea.
How do you English not understand this?

01:08.360 --> 01:10.612
It makes no difference,
but he'd lose his shit over it.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.490
Hey. Of course it makes a difference,
you fucking ponce.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.660
Bag, water, milk, in that fucking order.
Yes?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.161
A lot of Poles on your sites?

01:18.245 --> 01:22.541
Poles, Bulgarians, dirty little Romanians,
the lot.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.252
-Swarming.
-It's like a fucking refugee camp.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.755
No, hang on. You don't want one, do you?

01:28.839 --> 01:30.340
Nah. Hair of the dog, mate.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.468
Well, you must really hate your kidneys.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.554
Here he is. Sleeping beauty.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.472
Morning. Sorry, I crashed.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.808
-Kettle's just boiled if you want one.
-And we have milk.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.727
-You been out then?
-No, he's lactating.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.480
Fucking daytime TV.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.900
I wish we'd brought a PlayStation
or something.

01:47.983 --> 01:51.195
Hey. I'll tell you what, man.
I am a demon at FIFA.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.404
-No, you're not.
-Nah.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.823
Call of Duty, that's the one.
I'd take you all down.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.200
This isn't a stag weekend.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.661
Yeah, but you're only saying that because
you're scared that he is gonna beat you.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.915
You think I'm scared of
an armchair soldier?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.625
I've done it for real, mate.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.169
Served my country.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.255
How many people have you killed?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.675
You mean in the game, like?

02:13.759 --> 02:15.469
Fuck "in the game." How's that count?

02:16.345 --> 02:17.638
What's that mean?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.350
How many people have you killed?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.438
Well, how many people have you killed?

02:26.522 --> 02:28.774
Five for sure. They were up close.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.693
Watched the life drain out their eyes.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.238
Maybe eight, nine more.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.782
Sometimes you don't stop to count.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.834
Just hit a million views.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.168
-Yes.
-Yeah.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.838
Cooking. I reckon five
will tune in for the main event.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.091
Anyone check on him?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.592
Why?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.719
Just don't hear nothing, that's all.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.639
Can't fucking talk, can he?
Why do you care so much?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.016
Well, you wouldn't want him
to have an heart attack, would you?

03:03.100 --> 03:04.560
Might complicate things.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.812
Fine, I'll go.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.190
Any love letters
you want me to pass along?

03:10.274 --> 03:11.275
Fuck off.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.737
Don't be a ponce.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.576
Probably.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.636
I'm gonna take the tape off your mouth.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.349
But we can hear everything upstairs.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.936
You need something, ask softly.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.272
You shout for help,
them lights will go from green to red,

03:50.355 --> 03:53.734
and I'll come down, and I'll kick
your fucking bollocks off. Got it?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.960
Please, let me go.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.380
I can't. You're dangerous.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.341
I've seen what your lot are capable of.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.386
I left good friends in Afghan
'cause of you.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.014
So tomorrow morning,

04:24.598 --> 04:25.599
at sunrise,

04:26.850 --> 04:28.685
you're gonna kneel on the floor there,

04:28.769 --> 04:30.646
we'll have our camera,

04:30.729 --> 04:33.815
and then-- Well,
you people are the experts, aren't you?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.485
We're gonna cut your head off.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.975
Is there anything to suggest
we can expect further such attacks

05:50.058 --> 05:53.604
or is this, in essence, believed to be
an isolated incident?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.482
This video last night,
in which they made a threat…

05:57.566 --> 05:58.859
One minute. Thank you.

05:58.942 --> 06:02.946
…authorities are aware of,
but we have decided not to broadcast.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.746
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Morning, Diana.

06:10.829 --> 06:15.167
So this is a fast-moving situation,
so I will update you with what I know.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.502
Should we not wait for Tearney?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.421
No offense, Diana, but when I relay this
to the Home Secretary--

06:19.505 --> 06:23.300
I thought you were aware that our
First Desk is in Washington this week.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.345
-I was not aware.
-Ingrid is incredibly busy, Roger.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.681
As are you. Do you really need to be
across the minutiae of her schedule?

06:29.765 --> 06:33.644
I'm sure we all know how capable
a Second Desk Diana is. Diana.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.229
Thank you, Leonard.

06:35.938 --> 06:39.525
The hostage is Hassan Ahmed.
He was born in Birmingham.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.110
His grandparents arrived here
in the early '70s.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.738
He is the youngest of four children.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.823
He's in his second year
at Leeds University,

06:46.907 --> 06:48.200
studying business management.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.993
He shares a flat
with three other students.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.745
No known girlfriend or boyfriend.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.541
He's a cricketer. His family are Muslim.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.418
And before going to university,
he attended the local mosque,

06:58.502 --> 07:00.546
which is not on any of our watch lists.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.424
He no longer appears to attend,
but his family still go.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.344
In short, he is nothing other
than what he appears to be.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.222
A law-abiding, British-Asian student.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.017
The kidnappers call themselves
the Sons of Albion.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.686
They've been on our radar
for about a year,

07:15.769 --> 07:19.273
and there have been murmurs that
something like this was on the horizon.

07:19.356 --> 07:24.152
Point of order. Murmurs and horizons
are so vague as to seem unhelpful, Diana.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.654
Sources and methods, Roger.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.157
Outside of the sphere of this committee,
Roger. You know that.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.327
-We monitor results, not process.
-And do you have a source in the group?

07:32.411 --> 07:33.954
That would fall under process.

07:34.037 --> 07:38.041
What I can say is that
there are 17 such right-wing groups

07:38.125 --> 07:39.585
on our radar right now.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.171
We've been saying for some time
that with more resources,

07:42.254 --> 07:43.964
we could have them all
under proper surveillance

07:44.047 --> 07:46.550
and stop this kind of thing
from getting off the ground.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.926
The Home Office will back you.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.889
But the Treasury may add that you've
already had a considerable increase,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.390
with little increase in results.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.435
We have had an increase
to monitor jihadi groups.

07:57.186 --> 08:00.606
Unfortunately, we were looking one way
when we should have been looking both.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.566
He's landed, ma'am.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.445
Gentlemen, I need to be somewhere else.
I'm sure you'll understand.

08:12.034 --> 08:15.954
And immediately after that, I'll need
to contact the Pakistani ambassador.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.791
It appears this wasn't
the random snatch we thought.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.352
There's no sign of Cartwright,
and he's not answering his phone.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.150
What's wrong?

08:45.234 --> 08:48.237
The fact that you're still here
talking to me, for starters.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.447
No, it's mid-morning,
and you haven't had a drink yet.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.952
Why, in the old days you'd be
on your third stomach pump by now.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.372
That's your first taunt of the morning.
You're slipping.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.082
Something's definitely up.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.462
It's a bit late for getting good
at spotting your boss's moods.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.006
This shouldn't be in here.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.594
When Cartwright comes back,
tie him to his desk by his bollocks.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.849
I want my people in here, doing nothing.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.422
Geez.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.591
Christ.

09:51.842 --> 09:55.345
Do you do that thing here
where you burn ear hair out,

09:55.429 --> 09:58.223
because that is definitely
where I'd focus next.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.309
That is-- That's a two-week job, that.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.393
Envy.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.147
Can't afford places like this
on a Slough House salary, can you, River?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.941
No, that's true. But then again, I don't
need to come to a place like this.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.652
-I've learned how to shave myself.
-Then you don't need to be here, do you?

10:10.736 --> 10:14.198
No, I do, because I want to know
what was on Hobden's USB stick.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.701
-Gino, I need a moment.
-Of course, sir.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.785
Thanks.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.499
What the fuck are you playing at?
That's classified.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.335
Is it something to do with the kidnapping?

10:26.418 --> 10:28.837
I refer you to my previous answer.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.841
Okay, look, I get it.
We're just slow horses. We're grunts.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.053
It's just good to get feedback
when we've done a nice job.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.765
Of course you didn't do a good job.
You're slow fucking horses.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.060
Thank you.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.269
For what?

10:44.353 --> 10:46.730
For letting me know
there's nothing useful on the stick.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.525
-No, I didn't. I didn't.
-Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.945
And besides, to me it looked like it was
just pi to a million decimal points.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.405
You twat! You looked at it!

10:55.489 --> 10:56.990
Have fun with Sweeney Todd.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.379
Charles?

11:13.966 --> 11:15.759
Morning, Charles.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.678
Charles.

11:18.762 --> 11:19.763
Charles?

11:19.847 --> 11:21.348
He's in the bath.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.851
You are?

11:26.895 --> 11:27.896
Lamb.

11:28.897 --> 11:32.276
Morning, Catherine. Think I heard you
shouting about breakfast.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.738
Jackson.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.700
I thought you were in Berlin.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.368
Berlin's blown.

11:51.545 --> 11:55.299
Steve, there have been
no further statements from the kidnappers

11:55.382 --> 11:57.509
since their initial broadcast threats.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.804
Are we any closer
to identifying the man being held?

12:01.388 --> 12:06.268
My understanding is that the security
services have now confirmed his identity,

12:06.351 --> 12:08.061
but are not releasing it to the media.

12:08.854 --> 12:09.938
Catherine, how goes it?

12:10.022 --> 12:11.398
It goes.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.360
I wondered if you might wish to partake
of some charity. Raffle tickets.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.529
It's for a good cause.
It's my daughter's school.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.739
My purse is upstairs.

12:18.822 --> 12:24.203
I trust you. It's four for a fiver,
but ten for a tenner.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.413
-Just four.
-No. You'll want to go to ten.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.290
First prize is a spa day.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.250
-You wouldn't want to miss out on that.
-Four.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.300
-Check something for me.
-On the clock, yeah?

12:38.383 --> 12:39.384
River.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.303
Catherine.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.597
Where were you?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.182
Just getting some air.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.309
We have air in here.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.103
Yeah, well, it's pretty fetid.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.190
Lamb wants everyone at their desks.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.944
Sure, yeah. I've just--
I've got a bit of an IT issue

12:57.027 --> 13:01.198
that Roddy is helping me with.
My emails aren't syncing.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.202
Well, back to your station,
once that's done.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.329
Where's Moody?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.499
-I'm not his--
-Bitch. Yes, got it.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.640
Right. So, can you get
into Hobden's emails?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.560
Of course I can. Question is, why would I?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.855
Because you might help
to save that boy's life.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.731
Yeah, but I don't know that kid.

13:34.815 --> 13:38.318
And it's not like the Park will give us
a bonus or a medal for helping out. So…

13:38.402 --> 13:40.112
Oh, Roddy, Roddy, Roddy.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.865
Why exactly did you join
the service again, Roddy?

13:42.948 --> 13:46.368
Because the service wanted me
inside the tent, pissing out.

13:48.537 --> 13:52.291
This is a bigger ask than checking
a USB stick. Money won't cut it.

13:52.374 --> 13:55.002
Okay. Well,

13:55.794 --> 13:58.422
maybe do it
because I have something that you want.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.967
I know why you're in Slough House.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.261
No, you don't.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.180
Yes, I do.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.264
Impossible.

14:07.764 --> 14:11.143
The answer to that conundrum
has eluded the finest mind in MI5.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.979
And the finest mind being you?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.355
-Right. Of course.
-Yeah.

14:15.939 --> 14:20.569
Yeah. And if I can't crack that puzzle,
how could you?

14:23.071 --> 14:26.366
Because you don't have a grandfather
who used to be high-up in the service.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.496
You better not be bluffing.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.999
Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna try and bluff you.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.002
You're Roddy, McRodster, the Hot Rod.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.214
-You could take me apart online. Come on.
-Take you apart in a way

14:40.297 --> 14:41.965
-no one could put you back together.
-I know.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.884
It scares me.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.261
It should only take a few seconds.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.888
Good, man.

14:47.971 --> 14:51.892
My fingers are weapons.
My thumb is more powerful than Nero's.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.519
Did he have a strong thumb, did he?

14:53.602 --> 14:56.146
Thumb up or thumb down determined
whether you lived or died in the arena.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.857
-Right, I didn't know that.
-And in the online arena,

14:58.941 --> 15:01.610
I am somewhere
between an emperor and a god.

15:08.659 --> 15:09.660
Yeah, I can't do it.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.204
You just claimed to be a god, Roddy.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.164
Well, even gods have blind spots.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.250
What's the blind spot?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.626
He's air gapped.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.836
Right. What's "air gapped"?

15:20.254 --> 15:21.338
He's not online.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.715
Right. So he has to be online
for you to hack his emails?

15:23.799 --> 15:27.135
No, he doesn't use emails.
He's got no online presence at all.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.179
Nothing in the cloud, no social media.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.349
He's old-school. He's keeping it analog.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.142
Keeping it real.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.061
Right. I know for a fact
he's got a computer.

15:36.144 --> 15:40.148
He can have a computer, but he doesn't
send email or back it up online.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.862
Right, so the only way to find out what's
on his laptop is to grab his laptop.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.238
-Yeah.
-Right, cool.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.781
Yeah, but you'd have to be quick about it.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.701
A guy that security conscious
probably has a thermite pot.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.369
All right, what's that?

15:52.911 --> 15:54.621
It's a pot filled with thermite.

15:54.705 --> 15:55.873
Yes, I got that bit.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.960
Thermite's made up of aluminium,
iron oxide and a thin strip of magnesium.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.504
You stick it in a clay pot,
set it on top of your laptop or desktop,

16:02.588 --> 16:04.214
pigs kick the door down,
you ignite the strip,

16:04.298 --> 16:05.799
mix burns through the hard drive.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.512
You know that technically we're the pigs.

16:10.596 --> 16:13.473
I'm from the streets.
Sometimes I talk street.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.310
-Okay. Thanks, Roddy.
-Hey!

16:16.393 --> 16:18.812
You're supposed to tell me why I'm here.

16:20.189 --> 16:23.150
Well, deal was you got me
into Hobden's emails, and you didn't.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.235
So, next time.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.697
Fair play.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.794
River's back.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.547
Where was he?

16:45.631 --> 16:48.133
He said he went out for some air.
I didn't push it.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.511
The rest are accounted for, except Moody.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.682
You're not just worried
about River though, are you?

16:58.227 --> 17:02.314
Do you think it's a coincidence
that Diana Taverner

17:03.440 --> 17:06.693
ran a special op on a right-wing reject

17:06.777 --> 17:10.571
just as some prick nationalists

17:10.656 --> 17:12.491
kidnapped a brown kid?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.329
-Well--
-That was rhetorical.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.925
I can also tell you
that a multi-agency response

17:30.008 --> 17:31.635
is being coordinated, involving…

17:31.718 --> 17:34.805
The kidnappers
have threatened to execute him,

17:34.888 --> 17:38.725
with the authorities no closer
to identifying his location.

17:39.768 --> 17:43.230
The number of views of the video
now stands at one million,

17:43.313 --> 17:45.816
and this figure is rising rapidly.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.026
We're due to hear shortly
from a spokesperson

17:48.110 --> 17:51.321
from the Metropolitan Police's
counter-terrorism unit

17:51.405 --> 17:52.948
on their response to the video.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.334
I keep checking the news,
but there's no actual news.

18:04.418 --> 18:06.628
Yeah, well, the Park
will have imposed a blackout.

18:06.712 --> 18:07.713
Yeah, I know.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.675
You sorting that into recycling piles or…

18:15.596 --> 18:16.680
Where'd you go earlier?

18:17.306 --> 18:20.309
I wanted to find out if what you
downloaded from Hobden's USB stick

18:20.392 --> 18:21.852
was what the Park was looking for.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.438
But it wasn't.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.274
Think you'll find
what they were looking for in there?

18:38.702 --> 18:40.370
You don't wanna know what I'm doing.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.039
Probably get me kicked out for good.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.707
River, is it really worth it?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.792
I can't just sit around
and do nothing, Sid.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.296
I've got one lead,
and yes, it might be bullshit.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.340
But I have to follow it.
Otherwise, what good am I?

18:53.091 --> 18:55.886
I will clean that up. I promise.
Just don't let anyone touch it.

19:17.783 --> 19:18.992
Ma'am.

19:19.076 --> 19:22.788
Mr. Moody. Sit down quickly.
You've seen the news. I'm rather pressed.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.042
You bothered my head of security
last night.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.210
Yeah, well, he's an old friend.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.003
Well, I'm sure he is.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.589
You told him Jackson Lamb
is running an op.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.259
Duffy said he knew all about it.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.887
But I knew he was bluffing 'cause he
didn't know that Sid Baker's a girl.

19:38.971 --> 19:41.807
She's a woman and twice the agent you are.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.643
I spent six years as a Dog.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.186
For God's sake, do shut up.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.648
What I want to know is,
how did you find out about it?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.484
About what, ma'am?

19:52.568 --> 19:55.362
You're mistaking this for a conversation.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.365
When I ask for information, you give it.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.409
Don't play dumb.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.452
Don't lie. Clear?

20:05.038 --> 20:08.125
I gave Lamb a specific instruction.
Why were you in on the loop?

20:08.959 --> 20:11.044
Doesn't respect you.
Wouldn't confide in you.

20:13.589 --> 20:15.424
Do you remember the bit about not lying?

20:17.926 --> 20:18.927
There's a bug.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.682
Are you seriously telling me you planted
a bug in Jackson Lamb's office?

20:23.765 --> 20:25.475
-I never trusted that lazy bastard.
-Jesus Christ.

20:25.559 --> 20:28.353
-It's not like it was a personal thing.
-Why didn't the sweeps pick it up?

20:29.271 --> 20:32.566
Don't tell me you do the sweeping.
Jesus Christ.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.069
What else do you lot get up to
over there in toy town?

20:36.153 --> 20:38.780
I guess it was force of habit.
I used to be one of the Dogs.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.157
Really? You didn't mention that.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.702
And he doesn't give me anything to do.
Or at least anything that matters.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.079
He's just taking the piss.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.749
So I wanted to see if I could get
anything on him, and I have.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.334
The burnt-out twat.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.669
If he ever wants to get out,
I know exactly how he'll do it.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.130
I know where he'll go and under what name.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.093
Here's what's gonna happen.

21:00.177 --> 21:03.055
You are going to do me a couple of favors
off the record,

21:03.138 --> 21:06.058
which means that if anything
goes even slightly wrong,

21:06.141 --> 21:07.351
I'll have never have heard of you.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.560
Understood?

21:09.478 --> 21:11.563
Incoming only. And dump the bug.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.899
Slough House may be a dead end,
but it's part of the service.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.901
If it gets out it's been compromised,

21:15.984 --> 21:19.154
your former chums in the Dogs
will tear you apart.

21:19.821 --> 21:23.617
And, Moody, a word of warning.
Lamb's a burnout for a reason.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.204
When he was in the field, he had more
to worry about than screwups like you.

21:27.746 --> 21:31.583
He risked being caught,
tortured and shot, and he survived.

21:31.667 --> 21:32.876
Might want to bear that in mind.

21:35.170 --> 21:39.091
Well, I'm joined now by our home security
correspondent Derek Rothery.

21:39.174 --> 21:42.845
What can you tell us
about the investigation so far?

21:42.928 --> 21:47.724
West Yorkshire police have now confirmed
they're involved in the investigation.

21:47.808 --> 21:49.351
-This follows contact…
-Turn it down.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.602
…with Hassan Ahmed's family.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.980
Just the same shit over and over again.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.649
This is our big moment.
We've got the whole world looking for us.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.443
Do we have any information
on why Mr. Ahmed might have been taken?

21:58.527 --> 22:00.362
-Fucking--
-We don't. Now, it might be…

22:00.445 --> 22:03.156
You know you can't say a word
about this once it's done, yeah?

22:04.074 --> 22:06.326
We never knew each other.
We were never here.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.411
Yeah.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.580
-Please.
-Yeah, I'm proud of what we're doing

22:09.663 --> 22:11.373
-for our country.
-I need the toilet.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.667
-But I won't say nothing.
-No, you won't.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.210
'Cause if you do, I'll fucking find you.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.714
Look, I-I really need to go.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.677
Let him shit himself.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.262
-Hey, tell you what.
-Hello?

22:25.345 --> 22:26.972
He'll be shitting himself in the morning.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.599
-Please.
-I'll take him to the toilet.

22:28.682 --> 22:30.309
Just now,
you were getting off on the world

22:30.392 --> 22:31.894
-wanting to know who we are.
-I really need…

22:31.977 --> 22:34.188
You want them to know
you leapt up to wipe a Muslim's arse?

22:34.271 --> 22:35.272
I didn't leap up.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.149
Go find a bucket or summat.

22:37.232 --> 22:38.984
He's not using our toilet.

22:40.152 --> 22:41.153
Go on.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.026
Where is it then?

23:21.109 --> 23:22.236
Couldn't find a bucket.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.697
I think there's a bucket
in the back garden, you know?

23:27.366 --> 23:30.035
We don't know if this individual
was a person

23:30.118 --> 23:31.828
known to the police
or the security guards.

23:31.912 --> 23:34.581
-I'll do it then, shall I?
-But it is quite usual

23:34.665 --> 23:37.334
in terror-related incidents
for the authorities

23:37.417 --> 23:41.004
to refrain from sharing information
which they think might jeopardize the…

23:45.133 --> 23:48.971
But there is a significant police
presence in the area today, which…

23:49.054 --> 23:50.222
How was he, ma'am?

23:50.305 --> 23:53.267
If you're talking about Mr. Moody,
it's between him and me.

23:53.350 --> 23:55.936
Pakistani ambassador was not best pleased.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.437
I hear there's been a breakthrough.

23:57.521 --> 24:00.858
Well, not quite a breakthrough, ma'am,
but we think he's being held in London.

24:00.941 --> 24:03.777
-Because?
-It's London brick, in the basement.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.488
We presume it's a basement.
No light, bare walls.

24:06.572 --> 24:08.448
-Built in London brick?
-Yeah.

24:08.532 --> 24:11.535
So you've narrowed it down to one
in three and a half million houses.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.370
No, no. Lower than that.

24:13.453 --> 24:17.457
See, the age and style of the pointing
means we can limit it to certain areas.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.626
Victorian, before the mass expansion.

24:21.420 --> 24:24.298
Well, keep going.
I want an address, not a census.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.383
Anything new on the feed?

24:26.466 --> 24:30.637
What they did with the original upload
was a quite sophisticated bounce back,

24:30.721 --> 24:32.848
and the live feed's off-line now.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.893
When they come back online,
it will be to execute him.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.811
So find out
where they're broadcasting from.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.479
I need to update the Foreign Office,

24:39.563 --> 24:41.523
and I want you to run through
all the extraction options.

24:41.607 --> 24:43.901
-Yes, ma'am.
-No one goes home,

24:43.984 --> 24:46.737
and anyone home on leave,
you pull them straight back.

25:00.584 --> 25:01.919
You can use that.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.672
-Oh, no.
-Relax.

25:05.756 --> 25:08.133
Choppy choppy
isn't until tomorrow morning.

25:08.717 --> 25:12.012
-And then we fight back for our country.
-I'm British.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.056
What?
'Cause you passed the citizenship test?

25:14.139 --> 25:16.308
No, no, no. I was born here just like you.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.060
-My family moved--
-It's not the same.

25:18.143 --> 25:22.105
Jesus was born in a stable.
That don't make him a fucking donkey. Up.

25:26.652 --> 25:27.986
Hands together.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.576
Listen, please.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.662
Feet together.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.666
Don't you fucking move!

25:43.961 --> 25:45.212
There you go.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.173
You can use your toilet whenever you like.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.805
You think Churchill would be proud
of what you're doing?

25:54.888 --> 25:55.889
You what?

25:57.099 --> 25:58.517
Beheading me in cold blood.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.435
You're a coward.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.564
You wanna talk about cowardice?

26:04.940 --> 26:06.692
You can't even go on a pub stage.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.236
Was that your dream?

26:09.903 --> 26:11.321
Well, it's too late now.

26:14.741 --> 26:15.742
Boo!

26:22.749 --> 26:24.168
Fuck's sake.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.762
It's Robert Hobden for Nick Drew.

26:36.597 --> 26:38.849
Well, when did he leave? No, never mind.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.476
Can you just put me through
to whoever's on the news desk?

26:43.395 --> 26:45.397
I'm sorry, I can't leave a number.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.815
I'll call back.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.194
Hello, it's Robert Hobden again.

26:50.277 --> 26:52.696
Is Kate Draper out of her meeting yet?

26:53.322 --> 26:55.699
It's a bloody long meeting.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.244
It's a different meeting, is it?

27:03.790 --> 27:05.751
It's Robert Hobden for Peter Judd.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.962
No, well, then I'll call again. And again.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.647
Hey, your change.

27:27.272 --> 27:29.733
Five years, and he's never left a tip.

27:30.317 --> 27:31.902
Well, it's your lucky day.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.327
Standish!

30:38.547 --> 30:41.550
Yeah, I'd hang back if I were you. God.

30:41.633 --> 30:44.428
I have just let one rip.

30:44.511 --> 30:46.221
It's a killer.

30:49.683 --> 30:51.185
Get me Taverner on the phone.

30:51.727 --> 30:55.480
Catherine, you said later.
And later it now is.

30:56.023 --> 30:57.274
Give me a minute.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.321
Boss man?

31:03.071 --> 31:04.656
Piss off.

31:05.616 --> 31:07.284
Will do, shortly.

31:07.367 --> 31:09.912
After I've collected tax
from Ms. Standish.

31:11.997 --> 31:13.207
Connecting you now.

31:13.916 --> 31:15.751
Dickhead, I have a call.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.961
Diana?

31:19.421 --> 31:22.299
Who? Who the fuck are you?

31:22.382 --> 31:25.802
Well, if she can't come to the phone,
take the fucking phone to her.

31:25.886 --> 31:28.222
-You went for ten after all.
-Yeah.

31:28.305 --> 31:30.098
The message is,

31:30.182 --> 31:34.269
"Call me urgently.
I have the results of your test."

31:34.353 --> 31:36.980
Makes up for River leaving early
without a purchase.

31:37.064 --> 31:38.899
Yeah. Just get her to fucking call me.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.236
When exactly did Cartwright leave?

31:42.903 --> 31:46.323
I don't know exactly. About two hours ago?

31:46.406 --> 31:47.533
Just before Sid.

31:47.616 --> 31:50.077
All right. Well, fuck off.

32:04.591 --> 32:06.218
Jesus, this time tomorrow morning.

32:07.094 --> 32:09.054
Yeah, we'll be back here.

32:09.137 --> 32:13.058
Same shit, different--
You mean the hostage.

32:13.141 --> 32:16.353
Of course, well,
they'll find him before then, won't they?

32:16.436 --> 32:17.980
I mean, they have to.

32:18.063 --> 32:19.356
Yeah, let's hope so.

32:20.858 --> 32:22.568
You doing anything tonight?

32:22.651 --> 32:24.152
I'm praying for a lottery win.

32:25.696 --> 32:28.740
But I mean, that's not, you know,
necessarily location specific.

32:28.824 --> 32:30.784
I could do that on the move.

32:31.410 --> 32:35.497
Hey, you two flakies.
You forgetting we have a date tonight?

32:37.541 --> 32:40.752
Shit. Sorry, Struan, I've double-booked.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.796
I'm meeting a friend tonight now. Sorry.

32:42.880 --> 32:47.092
You met a friend last night too.
It's good to be popular. Min?

32:47.968 --> 32:50.220
Clare's texted.
Her sister's having a mare.

32:50.304 --> 32:52.306
Splitting up with her boyfriend.

32:52.389 --> 32:55.309
So, yeah, I'm on full-on dad duty tonight.

32:56.268 --> 33:00.189
Very well. We had such a laugh
last time we went for a drink.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.316
We must do it again at some point.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.400
Absolutely.

33:03.483 --> 33:04.776
Let's do Christmas drinks.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.570
It's February.

33:42.397 --> 33:43.815
What the hell are you doing here?

33:43.899 --> 33:45.150
I could ask you the same thing.

33:45.734 --> 33:46.902
Thought you might want a coffee.

33:46.985 --> 33:48.445
You didn't have any in the café.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.073
Sorry, have you been following me?

33:51.573 --> 33:52.950
You'd better hope not.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.369
Because that'd mean I tracked you halfway
across London without you noticing.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.287
-Jesus Christ.
-I thought you were good at this.

33:57.371 --> 34:00.541
Maybe that story about you
tailing Taverner is just a myth.

34:00.624 --> 34:03.877
That-- No. Not a myth, actually.
That really did happen.

34:08.632 --> 34:12.844
I was assigned to follow the Shadow
Minister for Education as an exercise.

34:12.928 --> 34:14.638
But then he had a heart attack
the night before.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.641
So I followed Taverner instead.

34:17.724 --> 34:20.018
And I watched her do everything.
Everything.

34:20.101 --> 34:23.647
Gym, breakfast, office,
gym again at lunch.

34:24.606 --> 34:26.567
I got within 10 feet and she never knew.

34:27.150 --> 34:30.737
Well, not until I showed her
the photographs the next day.

34:30.821 --> 34:32.864
And that bit about her applauding you?

34:33.614 --> 34:36.409
People have made more of that than
it warranted. It was just three claps.

34:36.493 --> 34:39.371
You should be applauding me. I kept an eye
on Hobden while you went to get your car.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.539
I should be applau--

34:41.623 --> 34:43.833
I would have stuck out,
standing around on the street.

34:43.917 --> 34:44.960
Well, I didn't.

34:45.043 --> 34:48.338
But then, as we've established,
I am better at surveillance than you.

34:48.422 --> 34:51.216
That's just-- Depends how you look at it.

34:51.717 --> 34:52.717
Come on.

34:53.510 --> 34:54.844
Unbelievable.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.513
You love it when I'm hard on you.

35:00.601 --> 35:03.812
So, what did you find in Hobden's rubbish
that put you in spy mode?

35:05.439 --> 35:08.984
Ho predicted that Hobden would've made
something called a thermite pot,

35:09.943 --> 35:12.905
which is basically a geek way
for the clinically paranoid

35:12.988 --> 35:14.364
to burn the computer to ash.

35:14.865 --> 35:19.620
And I found some steel wool
and rusting coffee filters in his rubbish.

35:20.204 --> 35:23.957
He'd been making iron oxide.
It's one of the ingredients for thermite.

35:24.541 --> 35:27.336
So he's got something on his hard drive
he doesn't want anyone to find?

35:31.298 --> 35:32.299
That is disgusting.

35:32.382 --> 35:33.967
That'd be the arsenic.

35:35.636 --> 35:36.595
How'd you get Ho to help?

35:38.847 --> 35:40.974
I promised I'd tell him
why he's in Slough House.

35:41.058 --> 35:44.186
-Do you know?
-I do, yeah. Do you?

35:45.479 --> 35:47.648
Well, anyway,
he couldn't do what I asked him,

35:47.731 --> 35:50.317
which was to hack into Hobden's email,
so I didn't have to tell him.

35:50.901 --> 35:51.944
Would you have told him?

35:52.027 --> 35:53.612
Yeah, he wants to know.

35:53.695 --> 35:56.198
-How would you have told him?
-I don't know. With words.

35:57.282 --> 36:01.078
Okay. Pretend I'm Roddy Ho,
and you tell me that the reason

36:01.161 --> 36:04.915
I've been shipped out to Slough House
is because I'm an insufferable prick.

36:04.998 --> 36:06.083
-I got moved…
-I'd sugarcoat it.

36:06.166 --> 36:09.461
…from every department I worked in in MI5
and Slough House was the only place left.

36:09.545 --> 36:11.088
But if he had gotten me
into Hobden's emails,

36:11.171 --> 36:13.215
-can we agree that would've been useful?
-That--

36:13.298 --> 36:14.967
He once put someone
on the sex offenders register

36:15.050 --> 36:16.593
because they nicked his seat on a bus.

36:16.677 --> 36:17.719
I didn't have to tell him.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.930
-Imagine what he'd do to you.
-So why are we arguing about this?

36:23.016 --> 36:27.020
Do you think Roddy could find out
why Lamb is in Slough House?

36:27.104 --> 36:29.356
No. Otherwise he would've already done it.

36:40.659 --> 36:44.496
Why are you here, Sid?
Not in the car, at Slough House.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.540
I thought Slough House was like prison.

36:46.623 --> 36:49.459
You're not supposed to ask
what you're in for.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.295
Well, you know why I'm there.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.131
Yeah, but everybody knows
why you're there.

36:55.382 --> 36:57.467
I was gonna give you a compliment,
but you can shove it now.

36:57.551 --> 36:59.678
Suit yourself.
I get enough flattery from Lamb.

37:00.345 --> 37:01.430
But that's what I mean.

37:03.682 --> 37:05.684
He can see that you're not
like the others.

37:06.435 --> 37:07.853
Because you're not.

37:09.146 --> 37:11.523
I mean, Min,

37:12.065 --> 37:13.066
Struan,

37:14.026 --> 37:15.027
Roddy,

37:16.028 --> 37:19.990
maybe not Louisa, but definitely Moody,
they were always headed for the skids.

37:20.073 --> 37:21.450
They're useless, but you're…

37:22.826 --> 37:24.870
You know, it just doesn't make sense.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.875
But whatever the reason
for being put in Slough House,

37:29.958 --> 37:33.086
it must've come out of nowhere, right?

37:36.298 --> 37:37.299
Yeah.

37:38.884 --> 37:40.469
Yeah, it did, and it's just…

37:42.304 --> 37:43.972
just none of your business.

37:45.641 --> 37:46.642
Okay.

37:48.268 --> 37:50.938
-So how long are you gonna sit here for?
-Just until Hobden goes to sleep.

37:52.147 --> 37:53.524
Then I'm gonna go in there and find out

37:53.607 --> 37:56.026
what's on that laptop
he's been carrying around all day.

38:32.020 --> 38:33.397
-Hiya.
-You all right, love?

38:33.480 --> 38:36.525
-Yeah, can I get a vodka soda, please?
-Yep, ice and slice?

38:36.608 --> 38:37.609
Yes, please.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.739
I'm just gonna be round there.

38:43.907 --> 38:45.158
All right.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.747
Thought you were babysitting.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.334
Thought you were meeting a friend.

38:55.836 --> 38:57.087
Poor Struan.

38:58.088 --> 39:00.132
Yeah, if he saw us here, I think he'd cry.

39:00.716 --> 39:01.967
You're not going home, then?

39:02.676 --> 39:05.596
Well, no. I thought I'd just
decompress a bit first, you know.

39:05.679 --> 39:06.930
Yeah. Fair enough.

39:07.014 --> 39:10.684
It's been one hell of a day
protecting the nation.

39:11.351 --> 39:13.896
Imagine the consequences
if I didn't turn up for work, eh?

39:13.979 --> 39:15.105
Thanks.

39:15.189 --> 39:17.774
Well, then I'd be left alone with Struan.
So please keep showing up.

39:17.858 --> 39:19.610
You should get danger money for that.

39:23.071 --> 39:26.366
So I'm assuming you didn't have a friend
around last night either, then?

39:30.454 --> 39:32.372
You know,
I don't actually have any friends.

39:35.709 --> 39:37.628
No, I mean that I have--

39:37.711 --> 39:39.004
I have people that I know,

39:39.087 --> 39:41.548
but, like, no one that I can talk to.

39:41.632 --> 39:43.592
Not about work anyway.

39:44.635 --> 39:47.054
Do you not stay in touch with any
of your old colleagues from the Park?

39:48.138 --> 39:49.890
No, they kinda shunned me.

39:50.641 --> 39:52.059
Well, I wasn't just shunned.

39:52.142 --> 39:55.979
I was shamed by everyone

39:56.063 --> 39:58.565
after… you know.

39:58.649 --> 40:00.400
You left a top secret file on a train.

40:00.484 --> 40:01.902
Yes.

40:01.985 --> 40:03.237
That.

40:09.785 --> 40:13.455
I was shaving in the bathroom,
listening to the radio,

40:13.539 --> 40:15.040
when it hit the headlines that…

40:15.999 --> 40:18.544
well, the file had been found
by a member of the public.

40:19.962 --> 40:24.132
And Clare just said, "What fool did that?"

40:26.218 --> 40:28.053
And I just started crying.

40:29.596 --> 40:31.598
I thought maybe she'd hug me.

40:31.682 --> 40:33.559
But nah. She didn't.

40:33.642 --> 40:37.729
She just said, "Min, you fucking idiot."

40:37.813 --> 40:39.690
Wow. That's…

40:42.442 --> 40:46.822
-And are things okay now between you two?
-Oh, God, yeah. I'm getting divorced.

40:49.658 --> 40:51.869
I guess she saw me differently after that.

40:54.621 --> 40:56.248
And you let us all think
you had a home life.

40:56.331 --> 41:00.919
Well, yeah. I mean, I keep up the lie
partly because I don't want to accept it.

41:01.003 --> 41:03.964
Partly because I do not wanna give Lamb
any more ammo.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.925
And, well, perhaps most importantly,

41:07.009 --> 41:09.428
because it stops me
having to go to the pub with Struan.

41:10.179 --> 41:12.139
I mean, oh, my God.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.560
-He makes me yearn for Alan Black.
-Yeah.

41:16.643 --> 41:19.188
Black was like Struan with depression,
but at least he didn't, you know,

41:19.271 --> 41:21.106
wanna try and continue talking after work.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.192
He's just so freaking keen. He's like…

41:23.275 --> 41:25.527
-Yeah.
-…you know, "Let's do a monthly dinner."

41:25.611 --> 41:26.987
"Let's go paintballing." "Let's…"

41:27.070 --> 41:29.823
So I guess we'd say
to those who have taken him…

41:29.907 --> 41:33.994
Please, he's done no harm to you.
Just let him go.

41:35.287 --> 41:36.496
The police are now saying

41:36.580 --> 41:38.749
the threat to Leeds University student
Hassan--

42:05.526 --> 42:06.902
Get me Ho.

42:09.029 --> 42:10.489
I think he's gone.

42:12.032 --> 42:13.659
Then get him back.

43:43.207 --> 43:44.958
Who was Hobden trying to call?

43:45.042 --> 43:48.629
Just a bunch of right-leaning editors
and journalists,

43:49.254 --> 43:51.173
but none of them took his calls.

43:52.257 --> 43:54.426
But he rang Peter Judd seven times.

43:55.052 --> 43:56.595
Judd is the worst.

43:58.013 --> 43:59.223
Yeah.

44:05.687 --> 44:06.813
Hello?

44:09.066 --> 44:10.609
I can't talk at the moment.

44:12.402 --> 44:14.488
-No, I'm watching him right now.
-Update me later.

44:14.571 --> 44:16.573
I will, but I have to go.

44:17.366 --> 44:18.408
Okay.

44:19.993 --> 44:21.495
Who's Aunt Zadie?

44:27.626 --> 44:28.627
There is no Aunt Zadie.

44:28.710 --> 44:31.672
I put that in
so if anyone got into my phone,

44:31.755 --> 44:33.298
they wouldn't know
who I'd been talking to.

44:33.382 --> 44:34.842
Wait, well, who were you talking to then?

44:35.634 --> 44:37.386
Someone who knows
you're watching Robert Hobden?

44:38.554 --> 44:39.555
That's not what I said.

44:40.180 --> 44:42.307
Yes, you did.
You just said, "I'm watching him now."

44:42.391 --> 44:45.727
Listen… There's a reason I didn't
tell you why I'm in Slough House.

44:45.811 --> 44:49.648
No, no, no. Sid, really, seriously,
you don't have to tell me why.

44:49.731 --> 44:53.318
It's not for something you did in the
field, because you're a brilliant agent.

44:54.653 --> 44:55.779
Kind-of-brilliant agent.

44:55.863 --> 44:58.115
So it's obviously something to do
with your personal life,

44:58.198 --> 45:00.826
-which is none of my business.
-No. River, it is your business. I…

45:03.203 --> 45:04.830
I didn't just follow you here today.

45:07.165 --> 45:08.375
That was Taverner,

45:09.209 --> 45:10.836
and I wasn't telling her
I was watching Hobden.

45:10.919 --> 45:12.880
I was telling her I was watching you.

45:18.093 --> 45:19.094
Are you being serious?

45:21.305 --> 45:23.348
You're watching me for Taverner?

45:23.891 --> 45:24.892
Wha--

45:26.185 --> 45:27.728
Why would she want you watching me?

45:27.811 --> 45:31.148
Look, I don't know, but it's the reason
why I've been sent to Slough House.

45:31.231 --> 45:33.150
To keep an eye on you.

45:35.777 --> 45:36.778
You're kidding, right?

45:38.530 --> 45:39.698
No.
