01:01.343 --> 01:03.443

01:21.358 --> 01:24.108

01:32.351 --> 01:33.184
(woman whimpers)

01:35.422 --> 01:36.882
- [Man] Ma'am?

01:36.882 --> 01:41.593
(woman whimpers)
(creature growls)

01:41.593 --> 01:42.426
- [Man] Ma'am!

01:43.650 --> 01:48.650
(door banging)
(woman whimpering)

01:54.159 --> 01:57.120

01:57.120 --> 01:57.953

(creature growling)

01:57.953 --> 01:58.786
(ominous music)

02:12.750 --> 02:14.410
- Are we there yet?

02:14.410 --> 02:16.100
- Are we there yet?

02:16.100 --> 02:17.750
- [Zeke] Shut up, please.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.060
- Yeah, but, Zeke, are we there yet?

02:21.060 --> 02:22.704
- Are we there yet?
- What?

02:22.704 --> 02:24.800
(woman laughs)

02:24.800 --> 02:26.830
- Hey, Zeke, by the way,

02:26.830 --> 02:29.610
Are we there yet?
(all laughing)

02:29.610 --> 02:30.633
- Are we there yet?

02:33.440 --> 02:34.463
How's Harland Manor?

02:38.460 --> 02:39.813
- It's a dream.

02:39.813 --> 02:42.190
I mean, I had goosebumps last night.

02:42.190 --> 02:44.730
Here, I want you to check this out.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.630
Now that you're all awake
before we do walk through light.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.810
White bound seen your cat, Miguel.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.610
Look here when I pull the card away.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.063
- Oh yeah, right there.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.600
Holy shit.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.400
- Was there anything down that hall?

03:02.810 --> 03:03.770
- No.

03:03.770 --> 03:05.600
- Did you have to be running
a sound test at the same time

03:05.600 --> 03:07.070
on any of the Spirit Boxes?

03:07.070 --> 03:08.090
- Yeah, of course.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.160
The WAV files are on the desktop,

03:09.160 --> 03:10.710
I separated as much as I could.

03:20.249 --> 03:21.249
- Holy shit.

03:25.044 --> 03:28.211
(low heavy breathing)

03:30.310 --> 03:32.343
- Damn, it's female, female for sure.

03:36.222 --> 03:37.800
(low heavy breathing)

03:37.800 --> 03:39.193
- Yeah, I think so.

03:40.710 --> 03:43.595
- Whatever that is is back tomorrow night.

03:43.595 --> 03:44.428
(laughs)

03:44.428 --> 03:47.860
- This place, they must've
seen some serious dysfunction.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.913
- Therefore, so will we.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.360
We'll get on one for sure.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.183
This is perfect finale episode, friends.

06:23.145 --> 06:24.312

06:40.179 --> 06:41.179
- Holy shit.

06:45.421 --> 06:48.921
(downcast dramatic music)

07:37.691 --> 07:39.191
- This must've been beautiful.

07:40.483 --> 07:43.473
- And at one point it was,
that was a long time ago.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.320
- Can you start by telling
us a little history

07:50.320 --> 07:53.363
about the place, specific
timeline, that sort of thing?

07:54.920 --> 07:57.180
- The manor itself was built
in the early 20th Century

07:57.180 --> 08:00.150
in 1917 to be specific.

08:00.150 --> 08:03.260
Original railing was a
Samuel Harland, psychologist,

08:03.260 --> 08:04.710
a surgeon.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.410
And the mayor was a boarding
school for wayward girls.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.820
24 Samuel died of consumption oddly,

08:10.820 --> 08:13.273
after being a Tito for most of his life,

08:14.120 --> 08:16.070
the school then went to his
younger brother, Thomas,

08:16.070 --> 08:18.170
who was a physician.

08:18.170 --> 08:19.820
- And he kept the school running?

08:20.840 --> 08:24.953
- He did, but Thomas Harland
was of questionable ethics.

08:25.910 --> 08:29.016
He expanded his horizons
on his long-term vision

08:29.016 --> 08:29.950
to own his own hospital,

08:29.950 --> 08:34.280
specifically for women with
medical and mental conditions.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.700
- It's admirable, I suppose.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.740
- Thomas also perform abortions.

08:38.740 --> 08:39.940
- Abortions?

08:39.940 --> 08:40.773
- Yes.

08:40.773 --> 08:42.770
It had to be kept quite
secret back in the day

08:42.770 --> 08:44.210
as you can imagine.

08:44.210 --> 08:46.440
His true vision was to construct

08:46.440 --> 08:48.960
a medical wing onto the original manor

08:48.960 --> 08:50.910
that was to be used for women's solely.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.230
- A women's hospital.

08:53.230 --> 08:56.540
- That's right now he
treat their psychological,

08:56.540 --> 08:58.900
and physical needs, like I said.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.040
Thomas began to raise money

09:00.040 --> 09:03.733
to build the hospital,
but didn't get enough.

09:03.733 --> 09:07.770
'Til one day, a private investor,
well-to-do gentlemen known

09:07.770 --> 09:11.782
in public and social
circles fell into his lap.

09:11.782 --> 09:15.260
After five long summers, he
laid the final brick in '41.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.060
- Do you know the name of the donor?

09:18.170 --> 09:19.250
- It was an anonymous type.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.310
It was never revealed,

09:20.310 --> 09:23.530
but as it turns out he had
a mistress who had fallen

09:23.530 --> 09:27.200
into a delicate situation.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.540
- Pregnant.

09:28.540 --> 09:29.760
- Yes, that's right.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.330
He was married and he needed his mistress

09:33.238 --> 09:34.680
to have an abortion secretly here,

09:34.680 --> 09:36.690
so the story goes.

09:36.690 --> 09:38.820
- No wonder he wanted his
name kept in the shadows.

09:38.820 --> 09:39.930
- And that's why he put up the money,

09:39.930 --> 09:42.100
a favor to the man who saved his marriage.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.483
Or blackmail, whatever feeds the beast.

09:45.323 --> 09:48.533
Oh indeed, Thomas actually
treated a lot of young girls

09:48.533 --> 09:51.140
looking for all sorts of
conditions on the upper floors,

09:51.140 --> 09:53.407
but he didn't stop doing abortions.

09:53.407 --> 09:56.020
He just moved those to the basement.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.040
And then down there he continued

09:58.040 --> 10:02.520
to solve rich white men's indiscretions.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.070
- Indiscretions, that's a
polite way of putting in.

10:06.450 --> 10:09.010
- They named the room "The Abortion Ward."

10:09.010 --> 10:09.843
- I mean abortions...

10:09.843 --> 10:11.330
I mean, even though there were kept secret

10:11.330 --> 10:13.260
in that time of American
history, from what I've read,

10:13.260 --> 10:15.030
they were quite common.

10:15.030 --> 10:15.863
And working with when would happen,

10:15.863 --> 10:18.260
just in fear of losing their jobs.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.590
- I've heard of places
like this in the South.

10:20.590 --> 10:23.710
They called them "birth control clubs."

10:23.710 --> 10:25.210
It was more like a back alley.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.570
- There were lots of reasons back then

10:28.570 --> 10:31.487
in Vienna on what mother came to watch.

10:31.487 --> 10:34.086
- So I have to say not much has changed.

10:34.086 --> 10:35.478
- It was a booming business.

10:35.478 --> 10:38.810
Dr. Thomas and Nurse Adelaide,
who also was his wife,

10:38.810 --> 10:41.350
conducted the operations though.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.950
In those days, men were botched,

10:44.030 --> 10:46.257
not bled death on the table.

10:46.257 --> 10:49.741
(eerie screeching)

10:49.741 --> 10:51.821
Excuse me for a second.

10:51.821 --> 10:52.893
- [Jeanie] What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

10:54.210 --> 10:56.493
It's important to tell
us everything, please.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.380
- It's just a horrible story
about Thomas and Adelaide.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.603
- It gets worse?

11:05.730 --> 11:07.050
- They were monsters.

11:07.050 --> 11:09.550
The more money came in,
the more evil they became.

11:10.660 --> 11:11.760
- Well what'd they do?

11:15.170 --> 11:17.190
- Documented an encounter
of a 15 year old girl

11:17.190 --> 11:20.536
being brought in by his
father for observation.

11:20.536 --> 11:21.369
After a few months,

11:21.369 --> 11:23.010
they realized that she was pregnant.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.657
Originally, they believed
it was the uncle's.

11:25.657 --> 11:26.740
- Her uncle?

11:26.740 --> 11:28.130
- Yes.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.520
The girl swore that the
baby wasn't her uncles,

11:30.520 --> 11:33.113
but she said the baby was...

11:36.386 --> 11:37.583
- [Thomas] Was what?

11:39.100 --> 11:41.900
- She said the baby was sent
to her from somewhere else.

11:46.262 --> 11:48.770
Dr. Thomas and Nurse Adelaide
scheduled her for an abortion

11:48.770 --> 11:49.920
like they promised her father,

11:49.920 --> 11:52.320
but apparently the girl
got a hold of a scalpel and

11:52.320 --> 11:54.880
as they were getting
ready to strap her down,

11:54.880 --> 11:56.618
she stabbed Adelaide to death.

11:56.618 --> 11:58.269
(high-pitched screeching)
- Where?

11:58.269 --> 11:59.102
- The basement.

12:02.420 --> 12:07.070
A little girl, people said
she was just by Satan himself.

12:07.070 --> 12:08.630
Running through the
hallways covered in blood,

12:08.630 --> 12:11.090
slicing anything that got in her away.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.090
- What was her name?

12:15.290 --> 12:16.393
- Sarah Garrett.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.910
Thomas found her in the hall in a closet,

12:20.910 --> 12:22.810
same closet they used to
put the troubled girls,

12:22.810 --> 12:25.803
it was kind of a punishment.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.490
- Must be quite the closet.

12:29.890 --> 12:31.260
- He injected her with a lethal dose

12:31.260 --> 12:33.273
of arsenic straight into
her veins right there.

12:33.273 --> 12:35.283
Then he shut the door and walked away.

12:38.310 --> 12:39.763
She died a horrible death.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.050
They say he then came back

12:42.050 --> 12:45.387
and took the body down the basement and...

12:45.387 --> 12:46.900
- And got rid of it.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.103
- And her unborn child.

12:49.610 --> 12:51.630
- Turns out Thomas was
sexually abusing a share

12:51.630 --> 12:55.370
of the young girls in his
care and he'd killed a few

12:55.370 --> 12:57.090
so they wouldn't talk.

12:57.090 --> 12:58.820
Most of them didn't have
any parents to speak of.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.293
He could do whatever he wanted.

13:02.185 --> 13:05.870
They got pregnant by him,
now he aborted it himself.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.420
Thankfully, after all
that, the law came down

13:07.420 --> 13:09.033
on him and his whole operation.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.440
They were closing in on
him, he committed suicide,

13:13.440 --> 13:15.820
just shy of a 60th birthday,

13:15.820 --> 13:18.050
hung himself before they can get him.

13:18.050 --> 13:18.973
- Got off easy.

13:20.370 --> 13:21.557
- Fuckin' A he did.

13:25.284 --> 13:27.950
- The city came in and shut
the place down in 1955.

13:27.950 --> 13:30.180
It went up for auction.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.080
- Damn, that's quite the story.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.883
He was a psychopath and
she was just as sick.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.673
There is a lot of pain in here.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.970
- What happened after the auction?

13:41.970 --> 13:46.400
- Well, for the next 20 years or so

13:46.400 --> 13:47.680
numerous people have owned it,

13:47.680 --> 13:50.410
but none longer than a year.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.540
To come to the disturbances,

13:52.540 --> 13:55.880
some wanted to tear down the
hospital and use the land.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.173
Others wanted to renovate
it and reuse it as a clinic.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.620
None stuck around long
enough to do neither.

14:02.620 --> 14:06.755
- So how did you come to
be the owner of the place?

14:06.755 --> 14:11.420
- Oh, in 1973, my grandfather
bought it off an investor,

14:11.420 --> 14:14.920
who was all too eager to
unload it and he was a realtor

14:14.920 --> 14:16.143
and could make a buck.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.020
I've seen a lot of things myself,

14:19.020 --> 14:21.730
but since the early 70's,

14:21.730 --> 14:23.890
the hospital stopped
functioning as a facility

14:23.890 --> 14:25.637
and been around since '81.

14:25.637 --> 14:27.330
The few people that
actually lived in the house,

14:27.330 --> 14:29.370
they didn't stick around for very long.

14:29.370 --> 14:30.900
All the residents just got spooked

14:30.900 --> 14:33.430
or went a little bit mad.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.590
Every single one, every time.

14:35.590 --> 14:37.633
Hey, okay, tomorrow night.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.460
- So what rooms or areas in the manor have

14:41.460 --> 14:42.933
a history of activity?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.880
- Most of them, but Thomas
and Adelaide's room had a lot.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.300
It's just up the first flight of stairs.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.810
- Can we see it?
(children laughing)

14:52.810 --> 14:54.133
- We could start there.

15:01.283 --> 15:04.450
(footsteps on stairs)

15:16.487 --> 15:19.070
(low churning)

15:24.711 --> 15:25.599
(ominous music)

15:25.599 --> 15:29.599
- Whoa, does anybody else
feel what I'm feeling?

15:30.485 --> 15:33.035
- The hairs in the back of
my neck are going crazy.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.843
- There is a real bad vibe in here, man.

15:38.364 --> 15:39.214
It reeks of evil.

15:41.135 --> 15:42.550
It was believed he molested

15:42.550 --> 15:44.250
some of those patients right here.

15:50.490 --> 15:51.853
- You here, Thomas?

15:54.300 --> 15:56.483
It takes a big man to rape a girl.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.110
I guess you're not that tough though, huh?

16:00.110 --> 16:01.413
Hung yourself?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.253
Coward's way out.

16:07.950 --> 16:09.545
You hear me, doctor?

16:09.545 --> 16:12.400
(creaking)

16:12.400 --> 16:13.443
What was that?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.183
- Was that door open when we came in?

16:18.183 --> 16:22.090
- It looks like we'll have
it on camera if it moved.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.257
Okay, let's X this fucker.

16:28.346 --> 16:30.596
(pounding)

16:34.545 --> 16:37.045
(eerie music)

16:55.154 --> 16:55.987
- Come on.

16:59.391 --> 17:01.724
(footsteps)

17:05.158 --> 17:08.230
- How did he get the girls to
the room from the hospital?

17:08.230 --> 17:11.070
Surely people would have seen
him bring them all up here.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.710
- When the hospital was being constructed,

17:12.710 --> 17:14.909
Thomas added a tunnel
that ran from the basement

17:14.909 --> 17:17.270
of the manor to the
basement of the hospital

17:17.270 --> 17:18.933
for exactly that reason.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.200
- We'd like to see that.

17:24.430 --> 17:26.057
- Right this way.

17:26.057 --> 17:28.390
(footsteps)

17:32.190 --> 17:34.440
(creaking)

17:38.126 --> 17:40.376
(creaking)

17:43.622 --> 17:46.289
(ominous music)

17:51.930 --> 17:54.849
- It was usually later, in
the middle of the night.

17:54.849 --> 17:57.930
This was so Thomas could make
his way secretly to the dorm

17:57.930 --> 17:59.500
and get the girls back to the house

17:59.500 --> 18:01.637
without anyone ever seeing or hearing him.

18:02.775 --> 18:04.833
- [Jeanie] Disgustingly intricate.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.293
- So where's the girl's dorm from here?

18:10.971 --> 18:12.003
- Right above us.

18:15.675 --> 18:17.423
(footsteps)

18:17.423 --> 18:19.756
(squeaking)

18:23.420 --> 18:24.253
- Gil?

18:25.110 --> 18:25.943
- Yeah?

18:31.308 --> 18:33.975
(ominous music)

18:35.888 --> 18:38.221
(loud slam)

18:47.550 --> 18:48.500
- This is the dorm.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.173
- Any activities in here?

18:53.560 --> 18:56.780
- Whispers, female whispers,
I can attest to that.

18:56.780 --> 18:57.993
I've heard them myself.

18:59.329 --> 19:00.162
- And...

19:03.400 --> 19:05.730
- Things moving from one place to another.

19:05.730 --> 19:06.853
That chair's awesome.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.013
- Holy shit.

19:10.800 --> 19:15.313
Sarah Ann, we know what happened to you.

19:17.830 --> 19:21.173
If you want to talk to
us, just say something,

19:25.740 --> 19:26.623
do something.

19:28.194 --> 19:30.270
(light static)

19:30.270 --> 19:33.300
Yesterday, Z caught an image of

19:33.300 --> 19:36.990
what looked like a
female in a hospital gown

19:36.990 --> 19:38.740
picking out of a closet.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.013
We also captured an EVP.

19:43.410 --> 19:46.293
- You both talked about
that young female voice

19:47.980 --> 19:50.253
was down the hall coming from a closet.

19:51.150 --> 19:52.873
- Let's take a look at that closet, yeah.

19:54.870 --> 19:56.090
- We're about to check out the spot

19:56.090 --> 19:57.300
where's Z captured the image

19:57.300 --> 19:59.803
and got voice data while
setting up yesterday.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.390
You okay?
- Yeah.

20:09.390 --> 20:10.739
Why?

20:10.739 --> 20:11.572
- Nothing.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.513
You're sweating.

20:14.830 --> 20:18.990
- Oh, I just got a little
queasy riding them back.

20:18.990 --> 20:19.890
It's warm in here.

20:22.140 --> 20:25.583
Did she sign yet, Evan?

20:27.470 --> 20:28.570
- We're working on it.

20:29.740 --> 20:30.950
It's going to happen, Jeanie,

20:30.950 --> 20:32.510
you know more than anyone
how much I want out.

20:32.510 --> 20:34.470
- I understand, okay?

20:34.470 --> 20:37.550
It's just getting a little
bit trying for me also.

20:37.550 --> 20:39.093
- You're right, look,

20:40.060 --> 20:43.520
I'm sorry that I've dragged
you through this for so long,

20:43.520 --> 20:45.893
but I promise we're so close to done.

20:46.780 --> 20:47.613
- Yo.

20:49.149 --> 20:50.799
What the fuck, you two, let's go.

20:55.327 --> 20:57.945
(ominous music)

20:57.945 --> 21:00.278
(footsteps)

21:05.976 --> 21:07.930
(rapid high-pitched beeping)

21:07.930 --> 21:10.490
- Whoa, major spikes.

21:10.490 --> 21:11.590
- Temperature dropped.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.303
- For sure.

21:13.303 --> 21:14.433
Like several degrees.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.280
People say they feel like they're

21:16.280 --> 21:18.610
being touched by something here.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.353
Some claim to be grabbed, scratched.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.573
- If there's anyone here, touch me.

21:29.860 --> 21:31.053
Let me know you're here.

21:34.850 --> 21:37.913
Tell me your name.

21:37.913 --> 21:38.746
(dark music)

21:38.746 --> 21:39.873
Tell me your name.

21:42.124 --> 21:43.292
(creaking)

21:43.292 --> 21:44.751
- Oh shit.
- Right there!

21:44.751 --> 21:47.284
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

21:47.284 --> 21:49.988
(dark music)

21:49.988 --> 21:51.003
(creaking)

21:51.003 --> 21:52.170
- Anyone here?

21:55.563 --> 21:57.073
We'd like to see you.

22:01.150 --> 22:01.983
Gone.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.980
We've got us a hot spot for sure.

22:07.980 --> 22:10.710
- This door in particular
does this all the time.

22:10.710 --> 22:12.910
Different speeds, just random.

22:12.910 --> 22:14.873
People have seen it for decades.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.233
Spooky, like I said.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.750
- We caught the image right here.

22:22.750 --> 22:25.433
Looked like it was half
in half out of the closet.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.420
- That's where Thomas killed Sarah.

22:29.974 --> 22:34.850
- This is a confirmed
location of a visual presence.

22:34.850 --> 22:38.963
- Sarah Ann, did you move this door?

22:41.500 --> 22:43.352
If you did, can you do it again?

22:43.352 --> 22:45.519
(beeping)

22:48.430 --> 22:49.570
Whatever it is, it must be moving.

22:49.570 --> 22:50.820
I'm not reading anything.

22:51.830 --> 22:54.763
- They say those are hers.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.970
- Looks like she put up
a fight, a hell of one.

23:01.970 --> 23:06.120
It's been said she threw
our fingers clear the bone,

23:06.120 --> 23:09.453
kicked and screamed
like she was possessed.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.690
- Her blood stains.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.440
We should get these DNA'd for sure.

23:14.940 --> 23:17.590
- Are those your scratches
and bloodstain, Sarah Ann?

23:22.100 --> 23:22.953
- No change.

23:24.690 --> 23:25.523
Sarah Ann,

23:29.890 --> 23:31.613
is this where Thomas murdered you?

23:39.510 --> 23:41.924
We got to save this for (indistinct).

23:41.924 --> 23:43.710
This could be a important.

23:43.710 --> 23:46.043
- Yeah, but portal it where?

23:52.490 --> 23:56.123
- Okay, Sarah Ann, if you don't
want to talk, that's cool.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.550
We'll be back tomorrow night.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.193
This is the best walk
through effort, by far folks.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.443
All right, what other rooms should we see?

24:13.520 --> 24:17.290
There's only one other room
and no one's been in there

24:17.290 --> 24:18.923
or been near it for decades.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.104
- Can we see it, please?

24:23.104 --> 24:25.771
(clears throat)

24:26.660 --> 24:27.530
- Come on.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.730
- I'm gonna X that spot.

24:42.450 --> 24:43.743
I know you're here.

24:45.780 --> 24:46.613
Say something.

24:48.510 --> 24:49.343
Talk to me.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.417
I got a thing for closets too.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.483
Dr. Harland is coming.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.443
All right.

25:11.443 --> 25:14.027
We'll catch you later, Sarah Ann.

25:14.027 --> 25:15.771
(creaks)

25:15.771 --> 25:17.500
(slam)

25:17.500 --> 25:18.543
I know you're here.

25:21.672 --> 25:24.339
(ominous music)

25:28.320 --> 25:30.740
- We got a drop in temp.
(rapid beeping)

25:30.740 --> 25:31.640
- Guys?

25:31.640 --> 25:32.892
- What, what is it?

25:32.892 --> 25:34.594
- I can't move.

25:34.594 --> 25:36.365
I can't move, can't fuckin' move.

25:36.365 --> 25:37.550
- Is someone here?

25:37.550 --> 25:39.360
You don't like us being here.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.193
Why?

25:41.032 --> 25:42.400
- Ev, check this.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.433
- What is it, guys?

25:45.150 --> 25:46.580
- The cold spot is
localized above you, man,

25:46.580 --> 25:48.023
it's right fuckin' on you.

25:48.023 --> 25:49.437
- Holy mother.

25:49.437 --> 25:51.761
- I feel like I'm being crushed.

25:51.761 --> 25:53.213
There's a lot of weight.

25:53.213 --> 25:54.966
I cannot breathe.

25:54.966 --> 25:56.668
I can't fuckin' breathe.

25:56.668 --> 25:59.060
(grunting)

25:59.060 --> 26:00.420
- Who's doing this?

26:00.420 --> 26:02.780
Tell us your name, Sarah Ann?

26:02.780 --> 26:04.294
- Check the Spirit Box.

26:04.294 --> 26:08.647
- Get your breath.
- Do it, just fuckin' do it.

26:08.647 --> 26:11.210
- Is there something you want to say?

26:11.210 --> 26:12.313
You've got our attention.

26:13.690 --> 26:15.290
- What are you saying?
Tell us.

26:20.248 --> 26:21.177
- I can't fuckin' breathe.

26:21.177 --> 26:23.710
They said we can't take him.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.947
Marlin, are you talking to us?

26:26.947 --> 26:28.710
Or the cops that came to get you?

26:31.415 --> 26:34.248
(heavy breathing)

26:35.692 --> 26:37.563
- Shit, shit.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.576
He's gone.
- You okay, man?

26:39.576 --> 26:41.433
- I felt like I was being suffocated.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.230
I couldn't breathe for shit.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.130
It was like, it's like
something was choking me.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.073
- It got you, look it.

26:48.270 --> 26:51.900
- What is it?
- Holy shit, man, it's red.

26:51.900 --> 26:52.733
Your neck, it's red,

26:52.733 --> 26:54.500
like something got wrapped around it.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.380
- Anything happened to anyone like this?

27:00.380 --> 27:02.040
- Similar.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.270
I've lost my brother a few times.

27:04.270 --> 27:06.120
Never any marks.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.670
Though I was, it felt the same.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.000
That's where they cut down Thomas Harland.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.606
- Just give me some space.

27:17.606 --> 27:19.107
I'm okay, I'm okay.

27:19.107 --> 27:21.690
- You just had a physical manifestation.

27:21.690 --> 27:23.740
It looks like rope burns
around Gilroy's neck.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.960
It happened right below where
Thomas Harland hung himself

27:26.960 --> 27:29.600
after being caught by
authorities for committing sexual

27:29.600 --> 27:31.833
atrocities and murdering a young girl.

27:34.036 --> 27:36.750
- That was intense.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.830
- The spirits are making
their presence known tonight

27:38.830 --> 27:40.340
and they don't like us being here.

27:40.340 --> 27:43.670
It caused Gilroy, residual agitation.

27:43.670 --> 27:46.453
Tomorrow's lockdown should
prove really interesting.

27:48.410 --> 27:50.040
All right.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.513
I'm just going to get
some shots for cutaways.

27:52.513 --> 27:53.513
I'll be right there.

27:55.165 --> 27:56.173
Shit.

27:56.173 --> 27:57.810
How you doing?

27:57.810 --> 27:59.183
Yeah, take this.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.870
Hey, listen, I need you
focused, brother, okay?

28:06.870 --> 28:09.120
This is season finale,
there's a lot of stake here.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.311
Yeah, good.

28:10.311 --> 28:11.780
Are you sure?

28:11.780 --> 28:14.512
You guys seem like you
got a lot of distractions,

28:14.512 --> 28:17.200
you and Jeanie know better
than I have your phones out.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.400
- Like I said, I'm good.

28:19.370 --> 28:22.440
- Katie's being a real bitch
about the divorce, man.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.610
Always a fuckin' ball buster.

28:24.610 --> 28:26.760
And it's real stressful
with the kids, man.

28:28.470 --> 28:29.303
Is that it?

28:30.710 --> 28:32.410
Nothing else you want to tell me?

28:34.209 --> 28:35.709
- Yeah, that's it.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.634
(footsteps)

28:46.132 --> 28:48.799
(ominous music)

28:53.911 --> 28:56.411
(eerie music)

29:02.787 --> 29:05.860
- Never had this much
activity happen so fast.

29:05.860 --> 29:07.410
We are getting such great stuff here.

29:07.410 --> 29:09.810
I mean, you guys are
stirring up some major dust.

29:09.810 --> 29:11.620
- Let me see about getting
that basement unlocked.

29:11.620 --> 29:14.020
Grab another infrared.
- Yeah, yeah roger that.

29:16.090 --> 29:18.250
- Most of this was for equipment storage.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.280
Electrical rooms, janitorial maintenance.

29:20.280 --> 29:23.830
But through that door is the um--

29:23.830 --> 29:24.673
- Abortion ward.

29:25.554 --> 29:26.387
- Yeah.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.290
- Get a shot of this.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.360
- It's been like that
ever since I can remember.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.950
I never had any desire to go in,

29:34.950 --> 29:37.440
to be honest, never curious enough.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.520
- So no one's been down
there nearly 70 years?

29:39.520 --> 29:41.310
None of the previous owners?

29:41.310 --> 29:43.903
- No one that I know of,
not even my grandfather.

29:45.170 --> 29:46.270
- Ever heard anything?

29:48.090 --> 29:50.320
- People have heard screaming.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.600
I've heard screaming, loud,
painful screaming, women,

29:53.600 --> 29:54.533
and babies cry.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.903
Some sounds more demonic than others.

29:59.070 --> 30:01.910
My brother had a psychic, she
laid her hands on the door,

30:01.910 --> 30:02.990
instantly, she turned white.

30:02.990 --> 30:05.090
Her whole body started to shake violently.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.950
She said there was evil in that room.

30:09.080 --> 30:09.913
- You got a key?

30:11.570 --> 30:12.463
- No on that.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.874
- Mind if we bust the lock?

30:15.874 --> 30:16.707
- Have at it.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.580
Just make sure you
replace it with a new one.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.898
- Listen, do you mind if I don't do this?

30:22.898 --> 30:24.592
- That's fine.

30:24.592 --> 30:25.790
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.793
- Do you want to stay top side?

30:29.300 --> 30:31.620
- Get some fresh air.
- That's cool.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.527
- We just have some stuff to do in there

30:32.527 --> 30:34.127
and then we'll wrap for the day.

30:35.087 --> 30:37.237
- Okay, I'll wait for
you so I can lock up.

30:42.744 --> 30:45.077
(scuffling)

30:46.230 --> 30:49.650
- Mr. Fergus has given us
permission to break the lock.

30:49.650 --> 30:51.920
We are most likely the first in 70 years

30:51.920 --> 30:54.120
to enter into this room.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.120
That is an old lock and there is no key.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.950
You'll see it as we do.
- Undisturbed for decades,

30:59.950 --> 31:01.840
we'll be going back in time and literally

31:01.840 --> 31:04.563
to the days of the
murders and before then.

31:06.810 --> 31:09.880
- All right, let's hope this plays out

31:09.880 --> 31:11.430
better than Al Capone's vaults.

31:16.469 --> 31:18.469
(clang)

31:19.814 --> 31:21.814
(clang)

31:23.200 --> 31:25.200
(clang)

31:26.385 --> 31:28.385
(clang)

31:31.968 --> 31:34.635
(ominous music)

31:35.897 --> 31:38.147
(clicking)

31:39.370 --> 31:41.716
Oh, shit.

31:41.716 --> 31:43.473
(coughs)

31:43.473 --> 31:44.306
Oh shit.

31:46.177 --> 31:47.670
- Oh God.

31:47.670 --> 31:51.187
- 70 years of stagnant air
and whatever the hell else.

31:54.923 --> 31:57.660
- Okay, there's no time like now.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.800
We're about to turn into the abortion ward

31:59.800 --> 32:01.620
where Sarah Ann Garrett's body was found

32:01.620 --> 32:04.350
and where she murdered Adelaide Harland.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.880
It's also the place
where countless secrets,

32:06.880 --> 32:09.950
some very late-term
abortions were performed.

32:09.950 --> 32:11.810
A great deal of death.

32:11.810 --> 32:13.630
If what's occurred
already in Harland Manor

32:13.630 --> 32:16.580
is any indication of what
we might come across,

32:16.580 --> 32:17.503
then get ready.

32:26.620 --> 32:27.453
- Goin' in.

32:29.766 --> 32:32.016
(creaking)

32:35.670 --> 32:37.170
- Temp has dropped.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.170
Might just be because we're underground.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.420
This is where the operations
happened would be my guess.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.253
- For sure.

32:48.290 --> 32:51.413
- God, can you imagine?

32:52.540 --> 32:54.103
Down here like this?

32:55.190 --> 32:58.040
- It feels like there are bugs
crawling all over my body.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.934
(clank)

33:01.934 --> 33:02.767
- Oh fuck.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.303
- This looks like a fuckin'
torture chamber in here.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.640
- Welcome to hell.

33:13.474 --> 33:16.141
(ominous music)

33:23.960 --> 33:26.403
This is where many lives
were lost and taken.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.213
The atmosphere is heavy, thick.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.213
The smell of evil deeds still
lingers in this abortion ward.

33:37.230 --> 33:39.730
God only knows what horror
was occurred down here.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.310
- Good luck.

33:44.310 --> 33:46.893
(faint static)

33:50.720 --> 33:51.593
- Hello.

33:54.103 --> 33:57.603
(heavy demonic breathing)

33:58.990 --> 33:59.907
It's her!

33:59.907 --> 34:01.395
(low demonic screaming)

34:01.395 --> 34:03.452
(heavy breathing)
(thud)

34:03.452 --> 34:05.730
Jeanie, Jeanie!

34:05.730 --> 34:07.146
- Get her up, get her up, get her up!

34:07.146 --> 34:08.329
- Breathe, breathe!

34:08.329 --> 34:10.236
Please Jeanie, breath, breathe!

34:10.236 --> 34:11.069
- What the hell?

34:11.069 --> 34:12.563
- Get out of the way,
get the front door open!

34:12.563 --> 34:14.583
Come on, come on, you got to breathe!

34:14.583 --> 34:15.813
Breathe!

34:15.813 --> 34:18.482
Breath Jeanie!

34:18.482 --> 34:21.535
(heavy breathing)

34:21.535 --> 34:23.868
(scuffling)

34:24.931 --> 34:27.348
(indistinct)

34:29.390 --> 34:32.321
(heavy breathing)
- You're safe, you're safe.

34:32.321 --> 34:35.964
Okay, you're out now,
Jeanie, you gotta breathe.

34:35.964 --> 34:37.573
Please, get your breath back.

34:38.846 --> 34:41.679
(heavy breathing)

34:42.900 --> 34:43.783
Just breathe, breathe.

34:46.462 --> 34:47.887
There you go.

34:47.887 --> 34:50.760
- You better have fucking got this.

34:50.760 --> 34:51.930
(laughing)

34:51.930 --> 34:53.628
- Hell fucking yeah.

34:53.628 --> 34:54.789
Woo!

34:54.789 --> 34:57.260
Fuck, that was so fuckin' intense.

34:57.260 --> 35:00.270
Jeanie was obviously
rushed big time down there.

35:00.270 --> 35:01.103
- Damn, Jeanie.

35:01.103 --> 35:03.257
That scared the shit out of me.

35:05.884 --> 35:08.165
(speaks Spanish) motherfuckers!

35:08.165 --> 35:08.998
Woo!

35:09.986 --> 35:12.810
- It's fine, she just, it was a lot,

35:12.810 --> 35:14.353
she got rushed down there.

35:17.619 --> 35:20.869
(light acoustic music)

35:28.143 --> 35:30.810
(ominous music)

35:32.015 --> 35:35.290
(faint sirens blaring)

35:35.290 --> 35:37.680
- Yeah, it's pretty cool,
that place is creepy.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.030
Gonna make a great episode.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.800
Yeah, no, I don't need to talk to mom.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.190
Hey, tell Gracie good night for me, okay?

35:46.030 --> 35:47.073
I miss you Buckaroo.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.220
I'll call you tomorrow.

35:50.220 --> 35:51.223
I promise.

35:52.670 --> 35:53.620
Hey, who's the man?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.573
All right, love you too, Eli.

35:57.430 --> 35:58.263
You okay?

35:59.112 --> 36:00.162
- A fuckin' headache.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.640
- Hey guys?

36:02.640 --> 36:05.540
You remember when we saw those
scratch marks in the closet?

36:05.540 --> 36:06.550
- Yeah.

36:06.550 --> 36:08.550
- Something strange happened.

36:08.550 --> 36:10.140
The system blinked.

36:10.140 --> 36:12.780
Just shut down, then the
next second it rebooted.

36:12.780 --> 36:14.230
- Something drained the power a little

36:14.230 --> 36:15.980
after I was attacked on the stairs.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.110
That fucker was waiting for us.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.250
- Premeditated.

36:20.250 --> 36:21.120
- Jeanie.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.450
- I think I'm going to
go lay down for a bit.

36:23.450 --> 36:24.710
I just need a little space.

36:24.710 --> 36:25.543
No offense.

36:25.543 --> 36:27.804
I just took a bit too much in tonight.

36:27.804 --> 36:29.760
I think we're all feeling it.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.069
- Goodnight, Jeanie.

36:31.069 --> 36:32.137
- [Jeanie] Goodnight.

36:32.137 --> 36:33.559
- See you bright and early.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.226
- Goodnight, Jeanie.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.449
What's next?

36:41.449 --> 36:42.860
My heads fuckin' killing me.

36:42.860 --> 36:43.760
- Let's finish up.

36:44.836 --> 36:48.080
Had a dresser in Thomas's room.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.233
- You here Thomas?

36:50.520 --> 36:52.633
It takes a big man to rape a girl.

36:54.100 --> 36:56.210
I guess you're not that tough though, huh?

36:56.210 --> 36:57.980
Hung yourself.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.283
Coward's way out.

37:00.461 --> 37:01.853
You hear me, doctor?

37:03.069 --> 37:05.571
(scuffling)
What was that?

37:05.571 --> 37:07.170
- Hey was that drawer open?

37:07.170 --> 37:08.443
- Glue it up, look.

37:09.533 --> 37:11.330
- [Evan] We have it on camera.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.820
- [Jeanie] Coward's way out.

37:12.820 --> 37:14.312
You hear me, doctor?

37:14.312 --> 37:17.200
(scuffling)

37:17.200 --> 37:18.193
What was that?

37:19.136 --> 37:21.040
- You son of a bitch.

37:21.040 --> 37:21.873
- Awesome.

37:24.350 --> 37:26.410
All right, well, I'm out.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.170
I'm going to have a smoke and then hit it.

37:28.170 --> 37:29.923
- Okay, yeah, man, get some rest.

37:31.048 --> 37:31.881
- Yeah.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.300
I'm going to call it too,

37:36.300 --> 37:38.503
let's review in the AM over coffee.

37:40.110 --> 37:40.983
Great work, Zeke.

37:41.872 --> 37:42.730
- No problem, boss.

37:42.730 --> 37:43.830
I just got a few things to finish up

37:43.830 --> 37:46.103
and then I will shut down shop.

37:56.430 --> 37:59.430
(anxious breathing)

38:09.488 --> 38:11.738
(honking)

38:34.042 --> 38:35.510
- I know that face.

38:35.510 --> 38:37.166
What?

38:37.166 --> 38:39.410
- I think we should pull back

38:39.410 --> 38:41.930
on the provoking tomorrow
night, you locked up.

38:41.930 --> 38:45.340
- That's what we do,
man, we rattle the cage.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.180
We shake the pot, that's
our, that's our show.

38:47.180 --> 38:50.103
- I know, I know the show
was my idea, remember?

38:51.460 --> 38:53.213
- Yeah, so you keep reminding me.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.780
- Look, there's something
more in that house

38:57.780 --> 38:59.780
than we've ever dealt with before.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.500
I think we can, we can,
we can do what we need to

39:01.500 --> 39:03.130
without anyone getting hurt.

39:03.130 --> 39:06.100
- Hurt, who's getting hurt?

39:06.100 --> 39:08.320
- I got a bad feeling
about this place, man.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.666
- You know, this isn't like you.

39:10.666 --> 39:13.960
Is there someone in particular
that you're worried about?

39:13.960 --> 39:15.673
- 'Cause you never back down ever.

39:15.673 --> 39:16.867
- What the hell you talking about?

39:16.867 --> 39:18.844
- you think I'm fucking blind?

39:18.844 --> 39:20.280
- No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.113
- Why Jeanie?

39:22.070 --> 39:23.530
Why?

39:23.530 --> 39:26.560
We agreed to never let
anything affect the team

39:26.560 --> 39:28.050
and now you're fucking her.
- Hey, hey, hey!

39:28.050 --> 39:29.810
- You're hiding it from me.

39:29.810 --> 39:32.730
And now you don't want your
little girlfriend to get hurt.

39:32.730 --> 39:34.940
Since when have you given
a shit about any of us

39:34.940 --> 39:35.773
except getting a good show?

39:35.773 --> 39:37.197
- You put some fucking (indistinct).

39:38.344 --> 39:40.150
Now don't be a jealous,
condescending prick

39:40.150 --> 39:41.330
because you fucked up your life

39:41.330 --> 39:43.023
and you got nothing to go home to anymore.

39:43.023 --> 39:44.540
- Fuck you man?
- Hey!

39:44.540 --> 39:45.373
- Jesus.

39:46.391 --> 39:47.990
(scuffling)
(glass shattering)

39:47.990 --> 39:50.300
Fuck you.
- Fuck, man!

39:50.300 --> 39:51.133
Enough!

39:51.133 --> 39:53.480
Fucking...
(grunting)

39:55.370 --> 39:57.230
- Calm the fuck down.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.389
Let go.

39:58.389 --> 40:01.544
(ringing)
(shouting)

40:01.544 --> 40:03.377
- Hey guys!
- Fuck you!

40:06.155 --> 40:08.167
(snapping)

40:08.167 --> 40:10.360
- Hi, hi, yes.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.410
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.490
Just, just a disagreement.
All right.

40:16.490 --> 40:18.960
Of course, yes.
Sorry again.

40:18.960 --> 40:19.853
Thank you.
Bye.

40:20.990 --> 40:22.563
What the hell, guys?

40:23.690 --> 40:26.003
- I'm sorry, I don't...

40:26.003 --> 40:29.067
I mean, I dunno what happened.
- I know.

40:29.930 --> 40:30.763
Let's move on.

40:32.601 --> 40:34.595
- Let's all just get some rest.

40:34.595 --> 40:35.428
All right?

40:36.389 --> 40:37.806
- Yeah, for sure.

40:39.026 --> 40:41.859
(heavy breathing)

41:02.049 --> 41:04.716
(faint buzzing)

41:12.718 --> 41:15.316
(crying)

41:15.316 --> 41:17.899
(somber music)

41:22.051 --> 41:24.301
(coughing)

41:29.079 --> 41:31.246
(sobbing)

42:27.303 --> 42:30.240
(eerie music)

42:30.240 --> 42:32.780
- [Evan] We're going into
lockdown for the night.

42:32.780 --> 42:35.990
This is where we separate the
natural from the supernatural,

42:35.990 --> 42:37.960
where we expose the paranormal

42:37.960 --> 42:39.713
and find the buried skeletons.

42:40.870 --> 42:44.450
If something scares the shit
out of us, we will chase it.

42:44.450 --> 42:46.000
No retreat.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.320
I am Evan Hawthorn.

42:47.320 --> 42:49.700
I've been chasing spirits since I was 18

42:49.700 --> 42:51.290
when my grandfather's spirit came

42:51.290 --> 42:54.413
to me one night in my room,
the room that he died in.

42:56.270 --> 42:57.440
- [Gilroy] I'm Gilroy Adams

42:57.440 --> 42:59.803
and I've been chasing
spirits since I was 14.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.350
A little boy who had died
in our house years prior,

43:03.350 --> 43:07.223
was living in my closet and
he was not a happy spirit.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.790
- [Jeanie] I'm Jeannie
Ross, and I've been seeing,

43:10.790 --> 43:13.550
hearing, and feeling
spirits since I was four.

43:13.550 --> 43:14.830
People thought I should be put away,

43:14.830 --> 43:16.650
but my parents understood me.

43:16.650 --> 43:19.347
We are "The Spirit Chasers"
and this is what we do.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.847
(eerie music)

44:14.173 --> 44:16.350
- [Zeke] Okay guys, radio check's clean.

44:16.350 --> 44:17.183
- You good?

44:18.860 --> 44:19.710
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:21.990 --> 44:23.693
It's just a stomach bug, I think.

44:24.810 --> 44:26.483
I'm good, let's fuckin' do this.

44:27.520 --> 44:28.570
- You heard the lady?

44:35.940 --> 44:36.890
Let's go, guys.

44:36.890 --> 44:39.068
Radio test, please.

44:39.068 --> 44:40.636
Evan.

44:40.636 --> 44:43.386
- [Evan] Check, one two, one two.

44:44.540 --> 44:48.200
- Round and round the rigid
rocks, little rascal rat.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.193
- Thanks.

44:50.300 --> 44:51.400
Jeanie, say something.

44:54.742 --> 44:55.575
Jeanie?

44:56.510 --> 44:58.890
- Yeah, one two, one two three.

44:58.890 --> 45:01.480
- [Zeke] That's great,
we are all good here,

45:01.480 --> 45:02.700
go get 'em troops.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.710
- All right, it's official boys and girls,

45:04.710 --> 45:07.990
we are in lockdown.

45:07.990 --> 45:11.087
All right, let's fuckin' do this.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.410
- [All] No retreat.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.440
- [Zeke] Later gators.

45:16.432 --> 45:17.920
- [Gilroy] Woo!

45:17.920 --> 45:20.670
All right, Uncle Gilly's comin' for ya.

45:20.670 --> 45:21.503
Woo!

45:22.435 --> 45:24.675
(ominous music)

45:24.675 --> 45:26.925
(chirping)

45:31.543 --> 45:33.793
(creaking)

45:37.234 --> 45:39.330
(gasps in pain)

45:39.330 --> 45:40.855
- Hey.

45:40.855 --> 45:42.042
Hey, hey, what's goin' on?

45:42.042 --> 45:44.390
- Nothing, let's go.

45:44.390 --> 45:47.590
- No, no, you've been
off these last two days

45:47.590 --> 45:49.620
and now you're worse today.

45:49.620 --> 45:50.540
What the hell is going on?

45:50.540 --> 45:51.640
I'm worried about you.

45:57.147 --> 45:58.730
Take your shit off.

46:04.758 --> 46:06.091
What's going on?

46:07.375 --> 46:08.792
- I was pregnant.

46:10.960 --> 46:11.793
- What?

46:13.748 --> 46:15.142
Was?

46:15.142 --> 46:17.430
- I had a fucking miscarriage last night.

46:20.747 --> 46:21.790
Yeah, it was yours,

46:21.790 --> 46:24.290
there hasn't been anyone
else for quite some time.

46:28.896 --> 46:30.563
- I'm, I'm so sorry.

46:34.327 --> 46:36.040
No, let's just finish this

46:37.910 --> 46:40.110
and then we can deal
with our personal life.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.660
I'm sick of sneaking around, Evan.

46:47.060 --> 46:50.100
Let's just kick ass on this
finale like we always do.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.540
Professional first, like we always say.

46:51.540 --> 46:53.350
- We are so far beyond that.

46:59.467 --> 47:01.330
- Not yet we're not.

47:01.330 --> 47:02.163
- Jeanie.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.243
I'm going to get custody
of my Eli and Gracie,

47:07.650 --> 47:11.380
and I will marry you and we
will have a family of our own.

47:11.380 --> 47:13.620
- I'm not even ready for kids yet anyway.

47:13.620 --> 47:16.563
I don't even have my own
shit together, obviously.

47:19.870 --> 47:21.470
Everything happens for a reason.

47:25.014 --> 47:27.097
I fuckin' love you, Evan.

47:34.416 --> 47:35.249
- Jeanie?

47:45.181 --> 47:46.181
- Good luck.

47:49.344 --> 47:51.927
(somber music)

47:52.846 --> 47:54.929
- What the fuck was that?

48:10.912 --> 48:12.495
- Is the doctor in?

48:19.915 --> 48:22.763
Thought I'd start in your
favorite place, Thomas.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.963
Let me give you a voice.

48:34.100 --> 48:36.235
Now's the time, Thomas.

48:36.235 --> 48:38.735
(eerie music)

48:41.680 --> 48:44.043
This is your favorite place, yeah?

48:45.470 --> 48:47.317
You little piece of shit you.

48:53.947 --> 48:54.864
No problem.

48:57.837 --> 48:59.783
I am here all night.

49:03.161 --> 49:05.411
(slamming)

49:08.979 --> 49:11.321
(creaking)

49:11.321 --> 49:13.654
(footsteps)

49:16.463 --> 49:18.963
(soft crying)

49:25.108 --> 49:26.108
- Ev, buddy.

49:28.995 --> 49:29.912
- I'm good.

49:31.665 --> 49:32.498
- Ev, Ev?

49:33.560 --> 49:34.477
- I'm good.

49:37.059 --> 49:38.309
- Jesus, sorry.

49:39.645 --> 49:42.367
(heavy sigh)

49:42.367 --> 49:43.200
- Oh fuck.

50:06.140 --> 50:09.101
If anyone is here, let me know.

50:09.101 --> 50:11.684
(light static)

50:13.240 --> 50:14.143
Move something.

50:17.350 --> 50:18.183
Say something.

50:27.973 --> 50:30.473
(eerie music)

50:42.804 --> 50:44.887
- Not much going on here.

51:02.149 --> 51:04.816
(ominous music)

51:08.318 --> 51:10.485
(beeping)

51:13.088 --> 51:14.843
- Holy shit, temp dropping.

51:15.892 --> 51:17.797
(crackling)

51:17.797 --> 51:21.247
If that's you, Thomas, you
didn't scare me yesterday.

51:24.730 --> 51:26.520
Temp's still dropping.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.583
Tell us what you want, Thomas.

51:34.636 --> 51:35.469
- Oh wow.

51:37.584 --> 51:39.834
(clicking)

51:41.270 --> 51:43.163
Something is there with you.

51:45.877 --> 51:48.377
(eerie music)

51:52.490 --> 51:53.907
- Listen to this.

51:56.458 --> 51:57.791
- [Voice] Leave.

51:59.751 --> 52:01.334
- It's wholly male.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.733
Is that you, Thomas?

52:11.717 --> 52:12.550
Leave?

52:13.405 --> 52:16.780
Fuck no, Thomas.

52:16.780 --> 52:17.813
We're here to stay.

52:18.650 --> 52:21.073
We're here to figure you the fuck out.

52:22.939 --> 52:25.889
You're not getting away with
anything this time, you sicko.

52:37.541 --> 52:39.041
Zeke, we're clear.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.113
Damnit.

52:48.459 --> 52:51.626
(scuffling footsteps)

52:54.160 --> 52:55.577
- Check this out.

53:05.350 --> 53:06.930
That's Thomas Harland.

53:06.930 --> 53:08.750
That's the pig himself.

53:08.750 --> 53:09.933
- He's engaging us.

53:11.350 --> 53:13.100
This isn't a residual.

53:13.100 --> 53:14.943
This is major fucking active shit.

53:17.470 --> 53:19.363
You got nothing, Thomas.

53:21.550 --> 53:22.383
Nothing!

53:24.880 --> 53:25.713
I'm right here.

53:28.063 --> 53:29.223
You sneak up behind me?

53:32.810 --> 53:33.643
Nothing!

53:37.487 --> 53:40.154
(ominous music)

53:45.130 --> 53:47.530
- Trying the dorm room
where Sarah Ann stayed.

53:47.530 --> 53:49.883
See if I can connect with her.

53:57.924 --> 53:59.924
Are you here, Sarah Ann?

54:13.370 --> 54:16.467
How about if I just sit for a bit?

54:27.457 --> 54:32.013
Are these your beds where you slept?

54:36.780 --> 54:38.680
Did Thomas molest two girls here also?

54:41.990 --> 54:44.740
(distant crying)

54:52.629 --> 54:54.554
(faint static)

54:54.554 --> 54:56.637
(clicks)

55:01.636 --> 55:04.886
- Move this flashlight if you are here.

55:15.891 --> 55:18.141
(sniffles)

55:22.461 --> 55:25.128
(ominous music)

55:26.291 --> 55:29.208
- Hey chicken shit, I'm still here.

55:38.712 --> 55:40.795
You're boring me, Thomas.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.873
What'd you fuck with me and then you hide?

55:49.650 --> 55:50.483
Fine.

55:51.750 --> 55:52.850
Go fuck yourself then.

55:55.110 --> 55:56.387
I'll go find Sarah Ann.

56:01.649 --> 56:04.482
(light footsteps)

56:13.286 --> 56:14.267
(ominous music)

56:14.267 --> 56:17.320
More, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.570
(high-pitched beeping)

56:21.678 --> 56:24.178
Ev, I'm in the master bedroom.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.410
- Everything's going off.

56:34.580 --> 56:36.747
(beeping)

56:46.580 --> 56:47.980
- I'm in the master bedroom.

56:49.250 --> 56:51.053
Static camera's been knocked over.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.347
Something's pissed.

56:55.612 --> 56:57.862
(creaking)

56:59.268 --> 57:01.601
(footsteps)

57:03.433 --> 57:04.600
What the ff...

57:13.610 --> 57:15.860
(creaking)

57:18.216 --> 57:21.466
You have my complete attention, Doctor.

57:42.518 --> 57:45.185
(rapid beeping)

58:08.890 --> 58:10.390
- Did you drain the equipment?

58:12.770 --> 58:14.897
Are you Sarah Ann Garrett?

58:17.287 --> 58:19.857
Are you Sarah Ann Garrett?

58:19.857 --> 58:21.940
(crying)

58:23.734 --> 58:26.317
(low growling)

58:36.209 --> 58:38.292
What do you want from me?

58:39.668 --> 58:41.335
- [Woman] Your womb.

58:43.452 --> 58:45.369
(slam)

58:51.104 --> 58:52.521
- Jeanie, Jeanie?

59:02.054 --> 59:04.721
- Are you still here, Sarah Ann?

59:07.473 --> 59:09.510
That voice didn't sound like a young girl.

59:09.510 --> 59:12.853
Was that you or someone
talking through you?

59:14.340 --> 59:16.507
(beeping)

59:18.865 --> 59:20.948
(crying)

59:34.540 --> 59:36.190
- Where are you going, Sarah Ann?

59:40.202 --> 59:43.369
(faint demonic voice)

59:52.202 --> 59:54.452
(creaking)

1:00:02.174 --> 1:00:05.007
- That was you, wasn't it Harland?

1:00:06.870 --> 1:00:08.170
Want to tell us something?

1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:11.433
I'm listening.

1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:17.073
Come on!

1:00:18.310 --> 1:00:20.096
Talk to me, I'm listening.

1:00:20.096 --> 1:00:22.263
(screech)

1:00:32.089 --> 1:00:34.922
(heavy breathing)

1:00:38.112 --> 1:00:38.945
The fuck?

1:00:44.490 --> 1:00:45.840
This wasn't here yesterday.

1:00:51.768 --> 1:00:54.101
It just went Arctic in here.

1:00:59.492 --> 1:01:02.517
I'm getting major, tons of static.

1:01:02.517 --> 1:01:03.613
(low demonic shrill)

1:01:03.613 --> 1:01:04.530
Ah, Christ!

1:01:07.388 --> 1:01:10.055
(rapid beeping)

1:01:16.107 --> 1:01:18.357
(coughing)

1:01:19.325 --> 1:01:22.575
(restricted breathing)

1:01:32.007 --> 1:01:33.757
Holy fuck, holy fuck.

1:01:40.586 --> 1:01:42.960
(ominous music)

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.960
- Shit, hey Gil, I'm getting
major interference here,

1:01:48.370 --> 1:01:49.203
tons of static.

1:01:49.203 --> 1:01:51.260
I just want to let you know,
you guys should get 0.5,

1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:52.093
but not here.

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:55.523
Hey, have you seen Jeanie?

1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:06.220
Zeke, look for her, this
place is on fuckin' fire.

1:02:06.220 --> 1:02:07.470
I'll check the dorm room.

1:02:09.832 --> 1:02:12.665
(heavy footsteps)

1:02:19.687 --> 1:02:20.520
- Yo Gil.

1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:25.059
This is the heaviest shit
I've ever experienced.

1:02:25.059 --> 1:02:27.870
We've got some seriously
tormented spirits in here, bro.

1:02:27.870 --> 1:02:30.120
- Majorly tormented.

1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:31.610
But I'm in it to win it.

1:02:31.610 --> 1:02:33.449
We got portals for sure, man.

1:02:33.449 --> 1:02:36.120
These are not regular spirits, my friend.

1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:40.913
- Oh, I know, these are
from, from another place.

1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:49.500
Look, let's not revisit last night, huh?

1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:52.350
We can't let this place get between us.

1:02:52.350 --> 1:02:54.450
- I know what was going on, man.

1:02:54.450 --> 1:02:56.240
I'm not stupid.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:57.890
I just wish you would've told me.

1:03:00.852 --> 1:03:04.260
There's just a lot going
on in my life, brother.

1:03:04.260 --> 1:03:06.550
My judgements and the tanks.

1:03:06.550 --> 1:03:08.930
- Yeah, you look like shit.

1:03:08.930 --> 1:03:10.631
- Yeah, so do you.

1:03:10.631 --> 1:03:11.464
- I know.

1:03:12.690 --> 1:03:14.680
- I take it you're going in the closet?

1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:16.110
- Yeah, for sure.

1:03:16.110 --> 1:03:18.210
You know me, I'm a fucking atheist,

1:03:18.210 --> 1:03:20.493
so whatever's behind that
portal, I'm not scared.

1:03:21.871 --> 1:03:24.820
- I'm lookin' for Jeanie,
she's off right of you.

1:03:24.820 --> 1:03:27.180
- Thomas walked up right behind me.

1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:28.510
Zeke got stills of it.

1:03:28.510 --> 1:03:30.103
- Fucker screamed in my face.

1:03:31.210 --> 1:03:32.870
Got on the box.

1:03:32.870 --> 1:03:34.092
- Sarah Ann?

1:03:34.092 --> 1:03:36.167
- No, you?

1:03:36.167 --> 1:03:37.000
- No, nothin'.

1:03:38.010 --> 1:03:38.843
- Jeanie maybe.

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.393
- Yeah, Jeanie.

1:03:50.484 --> 1:03:51.990
Hey?
- [Evan] Yeah?

1:03:51.990 --> 1:03:56.990
- For what it's worth, man,
you two make a perfect match.

1:03:59.646 --> 1:04:01.979
(footsteps)

1:04:10.697 --> 1:04:12.537
- [Zeke] Ev, still no Jeanie?

1:04:13.936 --> 1:04:16.188
I can't get her on the walkie either.

1:04:16.188 --> 1:04:18.333
(light static)

1:04:18.333 --> 1:04:20.638
(power fading)

1:04:20.638 --> 1:04:22.183
What the fuck!

1:04:23.602 --> 1:04:26.560
Oh, Ev?

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:28.243
Gil, Jeanie, anyone read me?

1:04:30.110 --> 1:04:31.313
Come on, come on.

1:04:36.808 --> 1:04:39.725
(breathes heavily)

1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:44.723
Someone here?

1:04:46.098 --> 1:04:47.048
Is someone with me?

1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:58.389
- [Zeke] Is someone here?

1:04:58.389 --> 1:04:59.972
Is someone with me?

1:05:01.488 --> 1:05:02.800
(boom)

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:04.853
Son of a bitch.

1:05:06.701 --> 1:05:08.701
(click)

1:05:12.810 --> 1:05:13.923
This is bullshit!

1:05:17.070 --> 1:05:19.987
(breathes heavily)

1:05:31.922 --> 1:05:34.339
(fluttering)

1:05:42.450 --> 1:05:45.563
Ever since I've gotten
here, I felt a pull to it.

1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:51.403
Closets are often gateways
and portals of some kind.

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:56.620
But I think that this gateway leads

1:05:56.620 --> 1:05:59.513
to a very, very evil place.

1:06:01.407 --> 1:06:03.824
(fluttering)

1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:09.060
I know those scratch marks
are yours, Sarah Ann.

1:06:12.735 --> 1:06:14.035
You tell me what happened?

1:06:16.206 --> 1:06:19.290
(fluttering)

1:06:19.290 --> 1:06:21.133
You came here for an abortion.

1:06:25.820 --> 1:06:26.883
Was it your uncle's?

1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:34.615
Or was it someone else's?

1:06:34.615 --> 1:06:37.115
(eerie music)

1:06:38.860 --> 1:06:40.413
Something else?

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:49.060
Are you possessed, like they said?

1:06:59.318 --> 1:07:01.318
Why'd you kill Adelaide?

1:07:04.830 --> 1:07:07.070
I'd say she deserved it, Sarah Ann.

1:07:09.532 --> 1:07:11.449
(boom)

1:07:19.110 --> 1:07:21.777
(ominous music)

1:07:45.024 --> 1:07:47.941
(breathes heavily)

1:08:24.347 --> 1:08:25.347
- Sarah Ann?

1:08:27.057 --> 1:08:29.547
Did you take my baby last night?

1:08:31.882 --> 1:08:33.965
(crying)

1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:54.687
Was that you?!

1:08:55.883 --> 1:08:58.050
(howling)

1:09:02.708 --> 1:09:05.708
(breathing heavily)

1:09:10.715 --> 1:09:12.632
(slam)

1:09:21.275 --> 1:09:25.058
(demonic screaming)
(Jeanie screams)

1:09:25.058 --> 1:09:26.475
Somebody help me!

1:09:30.110 --> 1:09:30.943
- Jeanie?

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:39.583
Jeanie?

1:09:42.890 --> 1:09:44.390
Are we done on the calm, Zeke?

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:46.633
Hey?

1:09:54.460 --> 1:09:55.293
Ah, shit.

1:09:59.068 --> 1:10:01.151
(grunts)

1:10:02.995 --> 1:10:05.912
(breathes heavily)

1:10:07.355 --> 1:10:08.188
All right.

1:10:13.145 --> 1:10:15.145
(clack)

1:10:26.450 --> 1:10:29.150
I'm going to go black to see

1:10:29.150 --> 1:10:30.993
if I can get more EVP readings.

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:36.870
Sometimes, oh.

1:10:36.870 --> 1:10:39.793
Sometimes when there's no camera,

1:10:40.690 --> 1:10:42.340
spirits tend to communicate more.

1:10:51.969 --> 1:10:54.136
(exhales)

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:02.283
We've been told that things
have moved around in here.

1:11:04.090 --> 1:11:05.640
Can someone do that for me now?

1:11:11.531 --> 1:11:14.198
(ominous music)

1:11:15.550 --> 1:11:18.143
Oh man, it's really crammed down here.

1:11:20.050 --> 1:11:24.963
Calms her down, maybe video too.

1:11:32.795 --> 1:11:35.378
(faint static)

1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:44.857
(demonic speaking)

1:11:45.942 --> 1:11:50.116
It sounds like the voice
from down the hall.

1:11:50.116 --> 1:11:53.033
(demonic speaking)

1:11:54.070 --> 1:11:54.903
- Her.

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:57.493
Who her?

1:11:58.940 --> 1:11:59.773
Sarah Ann?

1:12:02.390 --> 1:12:03.703
Who are you talking about?

1:12:08.382 --> 1:12:09.215
Shit.

1:12:10.228 --> 1:12:11.061
Ah...

1:12:14.143 --> 1:12:16.143
(sighs)

1:12:25.347 --> 1:12:27.653
Something is definitely in here.

1:12:29.810 --> 1:12:30.690
Or someone.

1:12:34.530 --> 1:12:35.363
Sarah Ann?

1:12:37.053 --> 1:12:40.083
Can you let me know if
you are here with me?

1:12:43.412 --> 1:12:47.210
(dramatic music)
- What the fuck?

1:12:47.210 --> 1:12:49.440
(beeping)

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:51.000
Stop, stop, stop.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.837
Stop, Stop, stop it, stop
it, stop it, stop it!

1:12:54.837 --> 1:12:57.420
(yells loudly)

1:12:58.633 --> 1:13:01.216
(faint static)

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:04.970
- Jeanie?

1:13:04.970 --> 1:13:07.233
Jeanie, Jeanie, do you read, Jeanie?

1:13:08.783 --> 1:13:10.950
(hissing)

1:13:16.148 --> 1:13:20.393
Gil, Evan, I need your
help in the basement.

1:13:20.393 --> 1:13:22.172
Jeanie?

1:13:22.172 --> 1:13:23.839
Jeanie, do you copy?

1:13:24.710 --> 1:13:26.185
Come on, Jeanie.

1:13:26.185 --> 1:13:28.426
(eerie music)

1:13:28.426 --> 1:13:30.176
Jesus Christ, Jeanie.

1:13:33.608 --> 1:13:36.441
(creaking)
Jeanie?

1:13:45.607 --> 1:13:46.440
Oh my God.

1:13:50.519 --> 1:13:53.352
Oh where the hell are you, Jeanie?

1:14:02.389 --> 1:14:03.770
(breathes heavily)

1:14:03.770 --> 1:14:06.020
(slapping)

1:14:09.482 --> 1:14:11.815
(footsteps)

1:14:14.139 --> 1:14:16.389
(plunking)

1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:20.230
(creaking)

1:14:32.173 --> 1:14:34.840
(ominous music)

1:15:05.584 --> 1:15:06.417
- Whoa.

1:15:08.941 --> 1:15:09.774
Whoa.

1:15:17.152 --> 1:15:18.402
Check this out.

1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:26.453
All these girls must've
done some bad time in here.

1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:35.850
Thomas was a real fuckhead.

1:15:38.033 --> 1:15:40.616
(faint crying)

1:15:42.178 --> 1:15:44.677
- Jeanie?
(footsteps)

1:15:44.677 --> 1:15:45.510
Jeanie?

1:15:46.409 --> 1:15:48.326
(slam)

1:15:54.421 --> 1:15:55.504
- More marks.

1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:06.713
Fuckin' sad man.

1:16:09.570 --> 1:16:14.123
Could say that Thomas
locked many girls in here.

1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:20.960
They must've been scared
out of their minds.

1:16:22.900 --> 1:16:25.700
I don't know what happened
to Sarah Ann Garrett in here.

1:16:34.857 --> 1:16:37.774
(breathes heavily)

1:16:47.899 --> 1:16:52.899
(electrical whir)
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1:16:53.551 --> 1:16:54.384
Ev, Ev?

1:16:55.956 --> 1:16:57.706
Oh come on, Gil, Gil!

1:16:59.551 --> 1:17:02.634
Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie, are you okay?

1:17:03.844 --> 1:17:04.677
(thud)

1:17:04.677 --> 1:17:05.594
Oh, damnit.

1:17:07.866 --> 1:17:10.699
(heavy footsteps)

1:17:13.688 --> 1:17:16.605
(breathes heavily)

1:17:19.330 --> 1:17:21.997
(ominous music)

1:17:23.898 --> 1:17:24.731
Jeanie?

1:17:25.762 --> 1:17:28.280
Oh shit, Jeanie, are you okay?

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:31.542
(breathes heavily)

1:17:31.542 --> 1:17:32.375
Jeanie?

1:17:45.330 --> 1:17:46.163
Oh my God.

1:17:57.028 --> 1:18:00.861
Hey, it's okay, it's
okay, it's gonna be okay.

1:18:03.735 --> 1:18:06.235
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

1:18:11.809 --> 1:18:13.642
Jeanie, ah geez, stop!

1:18:22.198 --> 1:18:24.365
(screams)

1:18:32.870 --> 1:18:33.987
Please, don't.

1:18:36.070 --> 1:18:36.903
Please.

1:18:38.474 --> 1:18:42.974
(screams)
(pounding)

1:18:45.879 --> 1:18:47.962
(clangs)

1:18:49.069 --> 1:18:51.236
(gasping)

1:19:01.967 --> 1:19:05.967
If you're in here Sarah
Ann, hiding from Thomas.

1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:17.070
Sarah Ann, it's me, Thomas.

1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:28.110
Sometimes it just takes
a little bit of time.

1:19:31.434 --> 1:19:34.027
And that is all we've got, time.

1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:43.353
Got all night, Sarah Ann, all night.

1:19:45.996 --> 1:19:48.579
(heavy exhale)

1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:52.633
- I'm just, I just got to
hold up here for a bit.

1:19:55.110 --> 1:19:57.560
This place has gotten to
me more than any before,

1:20:00.180 --> 1:20:02.603
but I'm not giving up, no way.

1:20:04.660 --> 1:20:05.557
None of us are.

1:20:08.704 --> 1:20:11.621
(breathes heavily)

1:20:16.383 --> 1:20:18.966
(faint static)

1:20:20.524 --> 1:20:22.577
- I've been in here for quite a while now.

1:20:25.020 --> 1:20:26.190
I've gotten no hits.

1:20:30.013 --> 1:20:31.096
No anomalies.

1:20:36.436 --> 1:20:41.436
Come on, come on, talk to me.

1:20:46.295 --> 1:20:48.660
Come on, goddamnit Sarah Ann, come on.

1:20:48.660 --> 1:20:49.577
Talk to me.

1:20:50.977 --> 1:20:52.033
Let me hear you.

1:20:53.279 --> 1:20:56.529
(low demonic growling)

1:20:59.623 --> 1:21:02.792
Is that all you got, Sarah Ann?

1:21:02.792 --> 1:21:05.375
(faint static)

1:21:10.927 --> 1:21:15.927
Shut the fuck up!

1:21:19.396 --> 1:21:21.563
(beeping)

1:21:28.329 --> 1:21:30.412
- Well, that's somethin'.

1:21:32.153 --> 1:21:34.736
(beeps slowly)

1:21:44.605 --> 1:21:46.855
(creaking)

1:21:48.481 --> 1:21:50.481
(slams)

1:21:52.742 --> 1:21:55.964
- There's something I need to get.

1:21:55.964 --> 1:21:58.556
(breathes heavily)

1:21:58.556 --> 1:22:01.056
The air in here is, I know it.

1:22:04.930 --> 1:22:06.180
It feels thick.

1:22:09.642 --> 1:22:13.201
It feels like I, I can't breathe.

1:22:13.201 --> 1:22:15.987
(exhales)

1:22:15.987 --> 1:22:18.320
My head is starting to hurt.

1:22:20.929 --> 1:22:23.158
Feeling disoriented.

1:22:23.158 --> 1:22:26.075
(breathes heavily)

1:22:27.162 --> 1:22:31.329
I think I should get out
of this closet right now.

1:22:32.542 --> 1:22:33.375
Oh, shit.

1:22:38.596 --> 1:22:41.458
(thudding)

1:22:41.458 --> 1:22:44.783
Hey, hey, can anyone hear me?!

1:22:44.783 --> 1:22:45.616
Hey, hey!

1:22:48.591 --> 1:22:49.424
Zeke?

1:22:50.798 --> 1:22:53.450
Hey, hey, hey, I'm in the closet.

1:22:53.450 --> 1:22:55.047
Someone fuckin' open the door, goddamnit,

1:22:55.047 --> 1:22:57.484
I'm fuckin' freakin' out here, get me out!

1:22:57.484 --> 1:22:59.470
Open the fucking door!

1:22:59.470 --> 1:23:01.849
Open the fucking door, now!

1:23:01.849 --> 1:23:03.266
Open it, open it!

1:23:07.099 --> 1:23:10.012
(creaks)
(slam)

1:23:10.012 --> 1:23:11.420
Jeanie, what happened?

1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:14.560
She was with child when
she entered this place,

1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:15.977
she is no longer.

1:23:18.224 --> 1:23:20.082
Who's she, you?

1:23:20.082 --> 1:23:21.329
Who are you?

1:23:21.329 --> 1:23:24.412
Jeanie, Sarah Ann, who?
- Both of us.

1:23:26.136 --> 1:23:28.886
(demonic scream)

1:23:30.184 --> 1:23:32.851
(quick jabbing)

1:23:36.458 --> 1:23:38.458
(swish)

1:23:57.985 --> 1:23:58.902
- Fuck you.

1:24:02.087 --> 1:24:05.337
(Gilroy screams)
- Gil!

1:24:06.203 --> 1:24:08.746
Gil's in trouble, I'm going up.

1:24:08.746 --> 1:24:11.554
(suspenseful music)

1:24:11.554 --> 1:24:12.387
Gil!

1:24:13.338 --> 1:24:15.671
(slam)

1:24:15.671 --> 1:24:18.348
Where the fuck is everybody?

1:24:18.348 --> 1:24:19.181
Gil?!

1:24:20.613 --> 1:24:23.277
Come on, talk to me, brother.

1:24:23.277 --> 1:24:25.052
(demonic growling)

1:24:25.052 --> 1:24:27.420
Oh God, that's blood.

1:24:27.420 --> 1:24:28.470
Something went wrong.

1:24:29.447 --> 1:24:30.280
Oh God.

1:24:34.950 --> 1:24:36.560
Oh my God, oh my...

1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:40.993
Oh, Gil!

1:24:44.090 --> 1:24:46.237
Shit, I knew it goddamnit!

1:24:47.307 --> 1:24:48.891
I knew it!

1:24:48.891 --> 1:24:49.891
Gil, oh Gil.

1:24:55.990 --> 1:25:00.050
What did this, what did this?

1:25:02.454 --> 1:25:05.371
(breathes heavily)

1:25:38.107 --> 1:25:39.524
- [Gil] Fuck you.

1:25:41.364 --> 1:25:46.364
- Oh my God.
(Gil screaming)

1:25:48.956 --> 1:25:49.789
Oh God.

1:25:56.825 --> 1:25:59.908
Oh God, Jeanie, what happened to you?

1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:13.213
(heavy footsteps)
Zeke?!

1:26:18.508 --> 1:26:19.341
Fuck!

1:26:20.855 --> 1:26:22.872
(electrical whirring)

1:26:22.872 --> 1:26:24.122
Son of a bitch.

1:26:28.823 --> 1:26:29.656
Goddamnit.

1:26:31.949 --> 1:26:34.883
(clopping)
Jeanie?

1:26:36.510 --> 1:26:37.810
I saw what you did to Gil,

1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.067
that's not you, honey.

1:26:40.067 --> 1:26:41.163
That's not you.

1:26:42.770 --> 1:26:44.003
Please snap out of it!

1:26:45.370 --> 1:26:46.203
Jeanie?!

1:26:48.350 --> 1:26:51.564
What happened to Zeke, where is he?

1:26:51.564 --> 1:26:55.603
Sarah Ann, did you take Jeanie?

1:26:58.800 --> 1:26:59.797
Who is her?

1:27:02.947 --> 1:27:05.730
(demonic scream)

1:27:05.730 --> 1:27:07.357
I'm not letting you take her!

1:27:08.944 --> 1:27:11.611
(intense music)

1:27:18.998 --> 1:27:22.493
Babe, it's me, Ev.

1:27:26.550 --> 1:27:27.793
It's not you, Jeanie.

1:27:30.140 --> 1:27:31.423
Jeanie, that isn't you.

1:27:33.550 --> 1:27:34.807
Something's got you.

1:27:36.090 --> 1:27:37.070
Something evil.

1:27:40.358 --> 1:27:42.053
Let's just get you out of here, okay?

1:27:46.385 --> 1:27:48.052
Right, there you go.

1:27:49.439 --> 1:27:52.831
(snarls)
(slam)

1:27:52.831 --> 1:27:54.914
(groans)

1:28:03.823 --> 1:28:04.656
Jeanie?

1:28:05.807 --> 1:28:07.400
Jeanie?

1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:09.046
(Ev screams)

1:28:09.046 --> 1:28:12.379
No, please, please, please, please stop!

1:28:14.974 --> 1:28:15.862
No, please!

1:28:15.862 --> 1:28:17.403
No, please, please, stop!

1:28:17.403 --> 1:28:18.236
Stop, no!

1:28:20.352 --> 1:28:21.678
Oh my God no!

1:28:21.678 --> 1:28:24.310
No, no, not in here, no, please!

1:28:28.410 --> 1:28:31.160
Please stop, please stop, please.

1:28:32.499 --> 1:28:33.999
Stop, please stop.

1:28:39.283 --> 1:28:40.116
Jeanie?

1:28:43.434 --> 1:28:44.351
Oh God, no.

1:28:47.770 --> 1:28:49.770
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1:28:55.573 --> 1:28:56.490
I love you.

1:29:01.551 --> 1:29:06.551
(demonic scream)
(Ev screams)

1:29:15.493 --> 1:29:17.993
(light music)

1:29:25.242 --> 1:29:26.710
Hey guys.
- How are ya?

1:29:26.710 --> 1:29:28.393
Hi, so this is it.

1:29:28.393 --> 1:29:29.226
- It looks great.

1:29:29.226 --> 1:29:31.790
House built in the late teens
hospital added in the 40s.

1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:35.010
- It's perfect.

1:29:35.010 --> 1:29:36.270
- I agree.

1:29:36.270 --> 1:29:37.610
Honey?

1:29:37.610 --> 1:29:39.400
What do you think, honey?

1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:42.030
Daddy will work right next to the house.

1:29:42.030 --> 1:29:43.973
We can have lunch together every day.

1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:48.793
- Honey?

1:29:50.546 --> 1:29:51.379
Honey?

1:29:53.999 --> 1:29:55.582
The baby's kicking.

1:29:56.506 --> 1:29:58.423
What is wrong with her?

1:29:59.658 --> 1:30:03.417
(high-pitched scream)

1:30:03.417 --> 1:30:06.084
(ominous music)

1:30:10.871 --> 1:30:13.288
(evil music)
