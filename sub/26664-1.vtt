Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:35.501 --> 00:37.668
<i>In Ancient Egypt,</i>

00:37.670 --> 00:40.570
<i>before the time
of the Pharaohs,</i>

00:40.572 --> 00:43.406
<i>legend tells of King Memtep,</i>

00:43.408 --> 00:45.942
<i>who made a covenant with Anubis,</i>

00:45.944 --> 00:48.412
<i>Lord of the Underworld,</i>

00:48.414 --> 00:51.747
<i>to create a cursed sword
so powerful</i>

00:51.749 --> 00:55.822
<i>that whoever possessed it
could rule the world.</i>

00:57.456 --> 01:00.723
<i>Fueled by taking the souls
of its enemies,</i>

01:00.725 --> 01:04.427
<i>the sword was forged
in the fires of hell</i>

01:04.429 --> 01:06.997
<i>by the Lord of the Underworld,</i>

01:06.999 --> 01:09.932
<i>who gave this sword
his very name,</i>

01:09.934 --> 01:13.236
<i>The Fang of Anubis.</i>

01:13.238 --> 01:16.305
<i>The names of those slain
by the sword</i>

01:16.307 --> 01:19.442
<i>were forever etched
in the</i> Book of Souls,

01:19.444 --> 01:22.745
<i>where they remained imprisoned
for all eternity,</i>

01:22.747 --> 01:26.485
<i>condemned to
never-ending darkness.</i>

01:27.819 --> 01:32.688
<i>But if evil can be so easily
created in a fiery forge,</i>

01:32.690 --> 01:36.994
<i>then surely there must be a
way to destroy the sword</i>

01:36.996 --> 01:39.962
<i>and release the souls.</i>

02:56.542 --> 02:59.475
These hieroglyphs
are ancient.

02:59.477 --> 03:02.446
- It looks like they are from...
- The Mesopotamia.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.047
Sumerian.

03:04.049 --> 03:05.685
What do they say,
Priestess?

03:47.859 --> 03:50.459
Here lies
the treasure you seek.

03:50.461 --> 03:51.596
King Memtep?

03:54.699 --> 03:58.034
Before you plunder the
antiquities of this tomb,

03:58.036 --> 04:02.571
you must know unleashing
this evil that once was

04:02.573 --> 04:04.509
will come with a great price.

04:05.843 --> 04:08.678
Power is not given,
Priestess.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.049
It must be taken.

04:40.511 --> 04:44.549
The Fang of Anubis,
forgotten to time.

04:47.518 --> 04:51.023
But the ages have not dulled
your cutting edge, have they?

05:15.780 --> 05:17.646
<i>Nebserek went forth,</i>

05:17.648 --> 05:20.049
<i>sweeping across
the barren lands</i>

05:20.051 --> 05:23.688
<i>with the Fang of Anubis
at his command.</i>

05:25.224 --> 05:27.057
<i>Driven by its dark magic,</i>

05:27.059 --> 05:31.026
<i>he conquered his enemies and
raised a powerful jackal army,</i>

05:31.028 --> 05:33.530
<i>proclaiming himself
their God-King.</i>

05:33.532 --> 05:35.799
We will cleanse this land!

05:35.801 --> 05:37.833
With death, and fire!

05:37.835 --> 05:41.571
<i>But one enemy
eluded him, the last Akkadian,</i>

05:41.573 --> 05:43.739
<i>the sole heir
to the great free tribe,</i>

05:43.741 --> 05:47.145
<i>who destroyed his people
in a war waged long ago.</i>

05:48.112 --> 05:49.646
<i>Branded by vengeance,</i>

05:49.648 --> 05:53.148
<i>Nebserek became obsessed
with finding his enemy.</i>

05:53.150 --> 05:56.585
Have your bird find the
Scorpion King, Priestess.

05:56.587 --> 05:58.888
The gods will grant
you your vengeance in time.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.960
The time for vengeance is now.

06:02.193 --> 06:03.729
Send the bird.

06:08.299 --> 06:10.566
<i>But some sleeping giants</i>

06:10.568 --> 06:13.172
<i>are better left
to their slumber.</i>

06:47.705 --> 06:48.773
It's beautiful.

06:50.309 --> 06:51.910
No, it's strong.

06:53.145 --> 06:54.046
That's what counts.

06:56.013 --> 06:58.148
With this, you can harvest
the winter wheat,

06:58.150 --> 07:02.785
reap the summer grain, feed
your family and livestock.

07:02.787 --> 07:05.588
Not much left in this world
you can put your faith in,

07:05.590 --> 07:09.191
but forged metal pounded
into shape,

07:09.193 --> 07:10.229
this you can trust.

07:16.801 --> 07:18.804
When will you
make a sword?

07:20.304 --> 07:21.804
Done with swords.

07:21.806 --> 07:24.744
I could learn to use one
to become a great warrior.

07:25.710 --> 07:26.811
Abel?

07:30.881 --> 07:32.816
Listen to me, Abel.

07:32.818 --> 07:34.783
Being a warrior
is not what you think.

07:34.785 --> 07:37.953
Swinging a sword in war
is a hard burden to bear.

07:37.955 --> 07:41.090
No priests or gods can save you
from the savagery of battle.

07:41.092 --> 07:42.862
Understand?

07:45.030 --> 07:45.965
Abel!

07:49.667 --> 07:51.737
Go to your father.

08:55.399 --> 08:56.801
Come on!

09:51.889 --> 09:53.957
I seek the Scorpion King.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.958
We have no king here.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.862
He calls himself Mathayus.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.199
We know of no such man.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.833
Burn it to the ground
and find him.

10:04.835 --> 10:06.438
Please!
We're just farm...

10:11.408 --> 10:13.843
Kill him first.

10:13.845 --> 10:16.246
No! No!

10:16.248 --> 10:17.316
Please!

10:37.134 --> 10:38.369
On your knees,
insect!

10:39.937 --> 10:42.073
Where is Mathayus?

10:43.340 --> 10:44.243
Here I am.

12:09.027 --> 12:10.993
No! Come back!
Come back!

12:10.995 --> 12:13.029
No! No!

12:13.031 --> 12:14.963
Got you!

12:14.965 --> 12:18.537
No!

12:19.904 --> 12:20.972
Please.

12:22.641 --> 12:23.976
Let the boy go.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.144
Not one more step.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.251
All right.

12:35.119 --> 12:38.323
Spare the boy, take me.

12:47.932 --> 12:49.167
I'll take both.

12:50.268 --> 12:52.271
No! No!

12:52.937 --> 12:54.606
No! No.

12:57.441 --> 12:59.043
Abel.

13:03.348 --> 13:04.416
Abel.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.249
Here. Drink this.

16:31.689 --> 16:32.655
What is it?

16:32.657 --> 16:35.594
A medicinal tonic mixed
with Lithops for pain.

16:36.894 --> 16:38.362
You're welcome.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.699
You need food.

16:56.314 --> 16:59.618
Fight! Fight!

17:07.559 --> 17:09.761
The Scorpion King escaped.

17:10.928 --> 17:13.196
Bend your knee
when you speak to me.

17:17.267 --> 17:18.532
- Escaped?
- Yes.

17:18.535 --> 17:20.438
He had help, my God-King.

17:24.641 --> 17:25.973
I need his soul.

17:25.976 --> 17:27.409
You have the...

17:27.411 --> 17:29.311
No.

17:29.313 --> 17:32.280
Only when I plunge
this blade into his heart

17:32.282 --> 17:33.782
will I have my vengeance.

17:33.784 --> 17:35.320
Find me this Akkadian!

17:41.826 --> 17:43.562
Cover yourself.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.798
Where'd you dig that up?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.566
Burial mound.

17:50.568 --> 17:52.671
The man who wore it
did not need it anymore.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.810
I am Tala,
warrior of Nubia.

18:01.378 --> 18:02.712
What do you want from me?

18:02.714 --> 18:05.583
A legendary king
to come back to life.

18:08.485 --> 18:09.751
I'm just a blacksmith.

18:09.753 --> 18:12.788
Blacksmith?
That is your story?

18:12.790 --> 18:15.590
How did a legendary
Scorpion King,

18:15.592 --> 18:19.494
last of the Akkadians,
demigod,

18:19.496 --> 18:21.465
become a blacksmith?

18:23.467 --> 18:25.903
Civilization became
too uncivilized for me.

18:27.304 --> 18:29.507
I have searched for you
for a long time.

18:32.443 --> 18:34.010
Your name inspires.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.311
It is a rallying cry.

18:36.313 --> 18:39.281
My people need a hero
to bring peace,

18:39.283 --> 18:40.484
a warrior hero.

18:42.387 --> 18:45.490
Like I said...
you got the wrong guy.

18:46.757 --> 18:50.992
My father was Balthazar,
King of Nubia.

18:50.994 --> 18:51.897
Balthazar?

18:53.898 --> 18:54.933
He lived well...

18:56.434 --> 18:57.703
but not long enough.

18:59.771 --> 19:00.739
Sorry he's gone.

19:02.773 --> 19:06.474
My father told me that you
two had a great bond,

19:06.476 --> 19:08.877
that if Nubia
ever needed an ally,

19:08.879 --> 19:12.013
the Scorpion King would ride
from the east with his armies

19:12.015 --> 19:13.918
and fight with us.

19:15.552 --> 19:16.819
I have no army.

19:16.821 --> 19:19.890
You have your strength,
and you have me.

19:22.426 --> 19:23.794
A princess?

19:24.462 --> 19:25.664
A warrior.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.765
Do you know Nebserek,
the War Lord,

19:30.767 --> 19:33.469
sweeps across Egypt
with his hordes

19:33.471 --> 19:35.538
enslaving, burning?

19:35.540 --> 19:38.907
He wields a cursed sword,
the Fang of Anubis.

19:38.909 --> 19:41.810
No one can stand against
him while he possesses it.

19:41.812 --> 19:46.014
But legend tells of a way
to defeat the sword.

19:46.016 --> 19:48.818
The secret is contained
in the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

19:48.820 --> 19:53.556
It is a hidden text,
and I know where to find it.

19:53.558 --> 19:55.424
Sounds like a bedtime story.

19:55.426 --> 19:59.431
Nebserek marches on Nubia,
on my people.

20:00.564 --> 20:02.964
With the <i>Book of Souls,</i>
we can stop him.

20:02.966 --> 20:04.002
You're on a quest?

20:05.002 --> 20:05.971
Yes.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.040
Good luck.

20:09.674 --> 20:10.942
You are coming with me!

20:12.810 --> 20:14.676
I don't quest.

20:14.678 --> 20:16.511
Why?

20:16.513 --> 20:19.749
They're always a thousand times
more difficult than you think,

20:19.751 --> 20:21.653
and someone
won't make it back alive.

20:28.693 --> 20:31.126
The jackal...
is Nebserek's symbol.

20:31.128 --> 20:33.462
We share the same enemy.

20:33.464 --> 20:36.030
Help me find
the <i>Book of Souls,</i>

20:36.032 --> 20:39.503
and I will help you
kill the owner of the dagger.

20:43.407 --> 20:44.509
I'll take both.

20:45.743 --> 20:46.544
No!

20:50.615 --> 20:52.748
You were born a warrior.

20:52.750 --> 20:57.552
It is your fate to fight
for those less fortunate souls.

20:57.554 --> 21:01.759
Stand or fall,
I will fight by your side.

21:03.194 --> 21:06.831
I implore you,
remember who you are.

21:30.588 --> 21:34.557
<i>This man you
seek, the Scorpion King,</i>

21:34.559 --> 21:36.661
<i>travels with a Nubian.</i>

21:42.199 --> 21:43.632
<i>And they are close.</i>

21:43.634 --> 21:44.867
Close to what?

21:44.869 --> 21:46.635
Legend tells
of a gateway

21:46.637 --> 21:48.870
in the Valley
of the 13th Moon,

21:48.872 --> 21:51.706
where it is said
the <i>Book of Souls</i> rests,

21:51.708 --> 21:53.943
hidden away
from all mankind.

21:53.945 --> 21:57.946
He who possesses
the <i>Book of Souls</i>

21:57.948 --> 22:00.950
has the power to destroy
the Fang of Anubis.

22:00.952 --> 22:04.720
These sands have been searched
by many hands for many years.

22:04.722 --> 22:08.960
Searched, yes, but not
by the Scorpion King.

22:37.554 --> 22:38.654
We should go around.

22:38.656 --> 22:41.857
The Valley of the 13th Moon
is a half day's ride away.

22:41.859 --> 22:43.858
Going around
is a day out of our way.

22:43.860 --> 22:46.694
- You don't wanna go in there.
- I must.

22:46.696 --> 22:49.298
- We can't be late.
- Late for what?

22:49.300 --> 22:52.001
The final day
of this lunar cycle.

22:52.003 --> 22:52.801
The moon can wait.

22:52.803 --> 22:55.172
I've waited 36 moons
for this rising.

22:57.574 --> 23:00.077
Ha! Ha!

23:18.562 --> 23:19.928
Why are we stopping here,
blacksmith?

23:22.966 --> 23:25.033
- Put your weapons down.
- There's nobody here.

23:25.035 --> 23:27.770
Yes, there is.
Drop your weapons, now.

23:27.772 --> 23:29.907
Forgive her!
She can't see!

23:31.309 --> 23:33.043
Who are you talking to?

23:45.089 --> 23:46.888
The Black Arrows.

23:46.890 --> 23:49.127
They weren't trying to hit us.
If they were, we'd be dead.

24:42.112 --> 24:44.215
Told you
we should've gone around.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.985
You trespass on
our sacred lands,

24:50.987 --> 24:53.757
and for this you must die.

24:54.291 --> 24:55.390
We meant no insult.

24:55.392 --> 24:58.027
The territory is marked.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.298
You chose to ignore
the warning.

25:01.998 --> 25:05.067
How did woman,
very beautiful woman,

25:05.069 --> 25:07.336
fall in with hard man
like this, hmm?

25:07.338 --> 25:09.007
Tell me, hmm?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.440
He's my father's blacksmith.

25:11.442 --> 25:14.342
A blacksmith
and a breeder.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.148
He likes you.

25:18.916 --> 25:21.817
Can you cook? Cook?
Can you cook? Hmm?

25:21.819 --> 25:23.821
I'm a Nubian warrior...

25:24.821 --> 25:26.888
Yes, I can cook.

25:26.890 --> 25:29.424
I will give you
two wild pigs

25:29.426 --> 25:33.328
and five amphoras of
pomegranate wine for her. Huh?

25:33.330 --> 25:36.898
- Yeah?
- Five wild pigs and ten amphoras.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.902
Oh, no, no, no!

25:39.904 --> 25:42.370
I thought you were
going to kill him.

25:42.372 --> 25:44.072
Oh, I am.

25:45.109 --> 25:52.114
But after I do, I will
take you for my own, hmm?

25:52.116 --> 25:54.415
Feed him to the wastelands.

25:54.417 --> 25:58.886
We will drink to his death
with my wine, huh? Huh? No?

25:58.888 --> 26:02.790
I'm not for sale.
And I'm not a breeder.

26:04.462 --> 26:05.493
Uruk!

26:21.177 --> 26:24.148
The Shaman says you are
from the Land of the East.

26:25.416 --> 26:29.186
The Scorpion King
is what you are called, eh?

26:30.788 --> 26:31.886
Just a blacksmith.

26:31.888 --> 26:33.355
Aye, this is what I said.

26:33.357 --> 26:36.961
That you are very small
to be such legendary warrior.

26:37.895 --> 26:39.494
So how do you want it?

26:39.496 --> 26:42.830
I can split your skulls
with an ax

26:42.832 --> 26:44.332
and stick them on a spike.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.868
You can burn on a pyre.

26:46.870 --> 26:49.805
Or I can lash you
to a stump

26:49.807 --> 26:52.176
and let the vultures
and insects have you.

26:54.043 --> 26:55.978
What is your name,
warrior?

26:55.980 --> 26:59.882
I am Uruk, son of Kali,
leader of the Black Arrows

26:59.884 --> 27:01.886
and People of the Sand.

27:05.022 --> 27:06.323
Chieftain Uruk...

27:10.394 --> 27:12.860
your people are hunters,
are they not?

27:12.862 --> 27:14.128
Mmm.

27:14.130 --> 27:16.900
So give me the same chance
to live as any beast.

27:18.869 --> 27:21.136
You are not a beast.
You are a man.

27:21.138 --> 27:22.838
Yes.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.240
I bleed red like you.

27:25.242 --> 27:28.409
And like you, I'd rather die
on my feet than my knees.

27:28.411 --> 27:33.016
I will only send four men
to kill you.

27:33.516 --> 27:36.018
Better make it five.

27:36.020 --> 27:40.289
When this hunt is done,
and I'm still alive,

27:40.291 --> 27:42.894
you let me keep the girl
and we ride free.

27:47.932 --> 27:48.967
Agreed.

28:06.082 --> 28:07.451
What did I tell you
about quests?

28:25.336 --> 28:29.941
When you reach that
arrow, we will hunt you.

28:31.507 --> 28:35.978
Run fast, blacksmith,
or your death will be slow.

28:58.636 --> 29:00.238
Run!

30:44.375 --> 30:45.410
Ah!

31:24.447 --> 31:25.649
Uruk!

31:42.800 --> 31:44.532
Drop it!

31:44.534 --> 31:46.470
Drop it!

31:54.144 --> 31:56.411
You are a worthy adversary,
Akkadian.

31:56.413 --> 31:59.548
You could have killed me
and my men,

31:59.550 --> 32:03.117
as we would have surely killed you, hmm?

32:03.119 --> 32:06.454
But you chose mercy.

32:06.456 --> 32:10.360
There will be no mercy for those
who have not shown mercy.

32:14.263 --> 32:17.465
Five pigs and some wine?

32:17.467 --> 32:19.436
That's all I fetch
in your simple mind?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.640
You've never tasted
pomegranate wine.

32:28.111 --> 32:29.379
- Ha!
- Hyah!

32:52.336 --> 32:55.403
There it is,
the Valley of the 13th Moon.

32:55.405 --> 32:57.438
Tell me about
the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

32:57.440 --> 32:59.875
It is said to be guarded
by the Temple of Scrolls.

32:59.877 --> 33:04.212
It can only be entered
on the eve of the Blue Moon.

33:04.214 --> 33:06.348
Once every three years
on the lunar cycle.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.584
That is tonight.

33:08.452 --> 33:10.351
How do you know all this?

33:10.353 --> 33:12.354
My family has been
the guardian of this book

33:12.356 --> 33:14.755
since before the Pharaohs,

33:14.757 --> 33:17.494
passing it down
from generation to generation.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.395
No one's been there
or seen this book

33:20.397 --> 33:22.833
because they've never
needed it until now.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.634
Before he passed,

33:25.636 --> 33:28.235
my father entrusted me
with this guardianship.

33:28.237 --> 33:29.637
As fate would have it,

33:29.639 --> 33:32.206
he didn't have time
to tell me much about the book.

33:32.208 --> 33:33.875
And you're sure
it's down there?

33:33.877 --> 33:35.812
The prophecy says it is.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.648
So, we're just going to ride down
there, walk through front the door,

33:40.650 --> 33:42.783
and they're going to
give you this book?

33:42.785 --> 33:45.252
It's not exactly a door.

33:45.254 --> 33:46.623
It's more of a gateway.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.980
Doesn't look like
a Temple of Scrolls to me.

34:45.982 --> 34:48.416
It's in ancient writing.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.920
"The one that
repeats its form."

34:51.855 --> 34:52.987
Sumerian.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.724
Not so different than the
language I learned as a boy.

34:55.726 --> 34:59.326
The moon repeats
its form every 30 days.

34:59.328 --> 35:00.795
The Blue Moon repeats its form

35:00.797 --> 35:03.297
every three years
after the summer solstice.

35:03.299 --> 35:04.734
We've found it.

35:09.038 --> 35:13.677
We found a stone gateway
in the middle of nowhere...

35:16.446 --> 35:17.811
leading to nothing.

35:17.813 --> 35:20.415
We must hurry,
it's almost nightfall.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.752
We can't miss the moonrise.

35:25.889 --> 35:28.355
What does your scroll say?

35:28.357 --> 35:30.391
"After you pass
the moonstone threshold,

35:30.393 --> 35:33.730
take four hundred paces
just east of north."

35:37.034 --> 35:38.502
This way!

36:04.927 --> 36:05.862
What now?

36:07.596 --> 36:09.866
Don't rush me. It's my
first time doing this.

36:23.547 --> 36:24.815
Moon's rising.

36:40.096 --> 36:41.564
Let's do this, blacksmith.

36:53.610 --> 36:56.009
The lenses must align
with a cipher.

36:56.011 --> 36:57.378
A combination.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.716
- What is it?
- I'm looking.

37:05.889 --> 37:07.958
"The one
that repeats its form."

37:09.125 --> 37:10.593
That's the cipher!

37:11.895 --> 37:13.594
"The one that repeats
its form."

37:13.596 --> 37:15.965
That's what's written
on the gateway.

37:59.676 --> 38:02.679
Let's go.
It won't stay open for long.

38:21.197 --> 38:23.530
What is that?

38:23.532 --> 38:24.632
Quicksilver.

38:24.634 --> 38:26.103
Nature's guard against evil.

39:11.214 --> 39:12.850
I hate quests.

39:30.667 --> 39:33.871
Blacksmith.
This way.

40:23.052 --> 40:25.922
Tell me you know what this
magic book looks like.

40:27.958 --> 40:31.695
It could be a scroll on vellum,
written in codex form...

40:32.795 --> 40:33.931
perhaps a tome.

40:35.065 --> 40:38.933
Maybe a papyrus book
scribbled in burnt bones.

40:38.935 --> 40:42.936
So, you're saying
you have no idea, right?

40:42.938 --> 40:45.808
Yes, that is
what I'm saying.

41:18.141 --> 41:20.077
Kill intruder!

41:21.143 --> 41:22.744
Ah!

41:22.746 --> 41:24.378
Ouch!

41:24.380 --> 41:26.049
No fair!

41:27.116 --> 41:28.851
Ah!

41:39.696 --> 41:41.264
Enkidu! Enough!

42:12.261 --> 42:15.029
These people opened the
portal with a lunar scroll.

42:15.031 --> 42:18.833
- They are not our foe.
- They are armed!

42:18.835 --> 42:21.170
One of them attacked me
unfairly from behind.

42:23.739 --> 42:25.241
I am sure
they meant no harm.

42:28.377 --> 42:33.249
I am Tala, daughter of
Balthazar, warrior of Nubia.

42:35.018 --> 42:37.253
We have come
for the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

42:38.188 --> 42:39.156
Have you?

42:53.869 --> 42:56.005
And you've brought a brute?

42:57.373 --> 42:58.409
A barbarian?

43:04.848 --> 43:06.083
You're Akkadian.

43:09.918 --> 43:11.018
What is that thing?

43:11.020 --> 43:14.121
I'm not a thing!

43:14.123 --> 43:16.292
- A golem.
- Stupid human!

43:17.527 --> 43:22.096
Enkidu is formed from clay,
brought to life by magic.

43:22.098 --> 43:24.532
My father made him
to be my protector.

43:24.534 --> 43:26.403
I have the strength
of ten men.

43:32.007 --> 43:34.977
Maybe 20.

43:42.786 --> 43:47.023
I bet you wouldn't sell her for five
pigs and some pomegranate wine.

43:48.290 --> 43:50.126
Barbarian.

44:00.869 --> 44:03.272
Pretty human.

44:26.228 --> 44:29.329
So you've come
for the <i>Book of Souls?</i>

44:29.331 --> 44:31.969
Yes.
My people are in peril.

44:32.902 --> 44:34.302
We need it
to vanquish a warlord

44:34.304 --> 44:37.270
who leads his army
across Egypt.

44:37.272 --> 44:41.477
He carries a cursed sword.
None can stand against it.

44:43.078 --> 44:46.079
I have nothing on how
to defeat a cursed sword.

44:46.081 --> 44:48.284
But the legend says
the book is here.

44:49.552 --> 44:51.485
You must help us.

44:51.487 --> 44:52.923
We are running out of time.

44:53.589 --> 44:55.590
I'm sorry.

44:55.592 --> 44:57.127
There is nothing here
for you.

44:59.362 --> 45:01.130
The book is here.

45:02.898 --> 45:05.866
I have many scrolls,
Akkadian.

45:05.868 --> 45:10.036
Some codices...
some tomes.

45:10.038 --> 45:13.209
I have read them all,
committed them to memory...

45:14.877 --> 45:17.080
but I have not a single book.

45:20.583 --> 45:24.221
Tala, what does your scroll
say about this <i>Book of Souls?</i>

45:27.623 --> 45:30.257
The scroll says,

45:30.259 --> 45:33.360
"The <i>Book of Souls</i> is written
on vellum of alabaster.

45:33.362 --> 45:36.963
The body of its forbidden
text is uncovered

45:36.965 --> 45:38.534
in the blue light
of the moon."

45:56.185 --> 45:59.255
"Vellum of alabaster.

46:02.324 --> 46:06.126
The body of its forbidden text
is uncovered

46:06.128 --> 46:09.563
only in the blue light
of the moon."

46:09.565 --> 46:12.333
Enkidu!

46:12.335 --> 46:13.503
No.

46:19.641 --> 46:23.145
It's... you.

46:55.344 --> 46:57.179
You are the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

47:04.319 --> 47:07.323
The moonlight reveals
the text?

47:08.725 --> 47:10.127
Yes.

47:12.427 --> 47:14.594
It is revealed
on the third moon

47:14.596 --> 47:17.264
in a season of four moons.

47:17.266 --> 47:20.070
Seven times
in the 19-year Metonic cycle.

47:20.770 --> 47:22.472
What's written here?

47:23.772 --> 47:27.775
Names of souls
taken by a sword forced

47:27.777 --> 47:30.210
in the Underworld
by Anubis.

47:30.212 --> 47:34.315
- Do you know who they are?
- Yes.

47:34.317 --> 47:38.351
With every soul
the sword takes,

47:38.353 --> 47:42.558
I can hear their screams,
see their faces.

47:47.797 --> 47:50.367
Some fates
are worse than death.

48:46.621 --> 48:49.625
I have no quarrel with you,
Chieftain Uruk.

48:50.460 --> 48:52.259
I seek the <i>Book of Souls</i>

48:52.261 --> 48:53.626
in the Valley
of the 13th Moon.

48:53.628 --> 48:58.431
Your jackal bellies
are never full, are they?

48:58.433 --> 49:01.434
Whatever the Akkadian
paid for passage,

49:01.436 --> 49:04.404
King Nebserek
will triple it.

49:04.406 --> 49:05.139
Mm.

49:05.141 --> 49:08.708
He paid with courage
and respect.

49:08.710 --> 49:12.246
Give us passage,
and you will be spared.

49:12.248 --> 49:15.318
Stand your ground,
and I will crush you!

49:21.190 --> 49:25.726
We are People of the Sand.

49:25.728 --> 49:28.395
Sand cannot be crushed.

49:28.397 --> 49:31.333
It can only change its form.

49:47.215 --> 49:49.550
You're going to pay for that.

49:49.552 --> 49:51.886
That was my favorite table.

49:51.888 --> 49:54.221
That was my only table.

49:54.223 --> 49:55.688
You shouldn't have
broke it then.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.458
Puny human.

49:57.460 --> 50:00.494
My father
was a great Sumerian mage.

50:00.496 --> 50:03.197
He brought me here
before I could even walk.

50:03.199 --> 50:05.632
He told me very little
about my curse.

50:05.634 --> 50:08.402
You have no idea how
to defeat this curse?

50:08.404 --> 50:11.505
The sword was found
in King Memtep's tomb

50:11.507 --> 50:13.407
beneath a city
called Amonesh.

50:13.409 --> 50:16.376
Your quest
must take you there.

50:16.378 --> 50:20.250
The secret lies within
King Memtep's tomb.

50:23.386 --> 50:24.621
All right then.

50:26.422 --> 50:29.458
We will go to Amonesh
and break this curse.

50:30.525 --> 50:34.730
First command!
Keep Amina here forever.

50:45.808 --> 50:47.775
I hate this puny human.

50:47.777 --> 50:50.911
There's a trade route that
leads to the city of Aqaba.

50:50.913 --> 50:52.545
There is a port here.

50:52.547 --> 50:55.683
You can hire a boat to
cross the sea to Amonesh.

50:55.685 --> 50:57.353
Amina likes him.

50:57.819 --> 50:59.286
This life...

50:59.288 --> 51:00.891
- He's ugly.
- ...must be hard to bear.

51:03.359 --> 51:05.427
I have escaped the pain
of the living.

51:06.696 --> 51:07.663
And the joy?

51:08.831 --> 51:10.300
Yes.

51:11.333 --> 51:13.335
It is more a burden
than a blessing.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.904
He's got muscles,
but I fight...

51:17.906 --> 51:19.708
Come with us
into the world.

51:20.976 --> 51:22.509
There is nothing more
I would love

51:22.511 --> 51:25.445
than to see your world
through my own eyes.

51:25.447 --> 51:27.583
A man of puny flesh.

51:29.552 --> 51:31.588
But I'm afraid
that's not possible.

51:33.022 --> 51:34.590
And if I can make it possible?

51:38.360 --> 51:40.628
He's got muscles,
but I fight muscles...

51:40.630 --> 51:41.829
I think
I found a shorter...

51:41.831 --> 51:43.931
No fire! No fire!

51:43.933 --> 51:46.467
- Put it out! Put it out!
- No fire! No fire!

51:46.469 --> 51:47.867
It's gone.

51:47.869 --> 51:50.536
Enkidu, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

51:50.538 --> 51:52.438
- Fire's gone?
- Yes.

51:52.440 --> 51:53.806
I forgot to tell them.

51:53.808 --> 51:55.409
And I'm still here?

51:55.411 --> 51:56.713
Calm yourself,
Enkidu.

52:00.915 --> 52:02.416
I hate fire.

52:02.418 --> 52:04.918
Enkidu cannot abide fire.

52:04.920 --> 52:07.454
- I hate fire...
- Not even the smallest of flames.

52:07.456 --> 52:08.725
I hate it.

52:12.694 --> 52:14.695
It's okay.

52:17.900 --> 52:18.969
Stupid humans!

52:29.411 --> 52:31.344
They are too
far ahead of us.

52:31.346 --> 52:32.715
We need to split up.

52:34.382 --> 52:36.382
There's only two ways
out of that valley.

52:36.384 --> 52:38.619
And we'll shut them both off.

52:38.621 --> 52:40.721
Ride the Silk Road
to where the dunes meet the sea.

52:40.723 --> 52:42.422
We have been riding
all the night.

52:42.424 --> 52:44.824
The men, the horses,
they need rest.

52:44.826 --> 52:48.695
You will ride until the horses'
hearts stop beating in their chests.

52:48.697 --> 52:52.699
And then you will go on
foot, crawling if you must,

52:52.701 --> 52:55.537
until I get
what I came for.

53:08.851 --> 53:09.983
Enkidu?

53:09.985 --> 53:13.456
What do you want, barbarian?

53:14.389 --> 53:15.558
To show you something.

53:20.862 --> 53:23.433
I've seen this tunnel
many times.

53:25.534 --> 53:28.434
I don't like this tunnel.
I've never liked tunnels.

53:28.436 --> 53:30.871
It's dark.
I don't like the dark.

53:32.407 --> 53:36.578
No fire! No fire!
Amina! Amina!

53:37.545 --> 53:39.846
Amina!

53:39.848 --> 53:43.083
Amina! We must go!
It won't last long.

53:43.085 --> 53:44.985
Amina!

53:44.987 --> 53:47.454
Amina! Don't leave!

53:47.456 --> 53:50.523
Don't go!

53:51.893 --> 53:53.427
Hyah!

54:32.601 --> 54:33.636
Let's ride!

55:46.875 --> 55:50.009
The horses are rested
and we need to keep moving.

55:50.011 --> 55:50.979
One more minute?

55:53.281 --> 55:54.650
The sea is beautiful.

55:56.518 --> 55:59.955
I can hear the voices
whispering from ancient shores.

56:02.824 --> 56:04.761
I can taste the salt.

56:06.862 --> 56:09.165
I hope Enkidu will be
all right without me.

56:11.567 --> 56:12.869
We've never been apart.

56:15.770 --> 56:18.173
How does such a creature
have a mortal fear of fire?

56:20.009 --> 56:22.009
Enkidu is clay.

56:22.011 --> 56:24.681
The manifestation of fire
can turn him to stone.

56:34.690 --> 56:36.893
You're an unexpected
surprise, Akkadian.

56:38.027 --> 56:40.029
As are you... Amina.

57:13.094 --> 57:14.163
Hyah! Hyah!

57:14.929 --> 57:16.697
Stop the Akkadian!

57:23.806 --> 57:25.105
I'll take the two
on the right.

57:25.107 --> 57:27.306
That leaves me
the seven on the left.

57:27.308 --> 57:28.608
Exactly.

57:28.610 --> 57:32.212
You have a book
my master desires!

57:32.214 --> 57:34.014
I don't read books!

57:34.016 --> 57:37.817
Give it to me, Akkadian,
and I give you my word...

57:37.819 --> 57:39.886
I will not leave you
butchered and cleaved.

57:39.888 --> 57:44.291
I will give you a death
worthy of a Scorpion King!

57:44.293 --> 57:47.263
I've turned down that same
offer many times before.

57:49.831 --> 57:51.732
But you are one!

57:51.734 --> 57:53.168
We are many!

57:54.168 --> 57:55.237
We are two.

57:57.373 --> 57:58.273
The woman?

58:02.877 --> 58:06.913
The woman! The woman!

58:06.915 --> 58:10.050
All right. I'll take
the three on the right.

58:10.052 --> 58:11.120
Fair enough.

58:12.054 --> 58:12.889
Ya!

59:22.458 --> 59:23.860
Tala! Get Amina outta here!

59:26.395 --> 59:29.165
Amina! Amina!

59:42.310 --> 59:43.946
Ah!

59:55.223 --> 59:57.092
Ah! Ah!

01:00:01.496 --> 01:00:03.299
I'm gonna smash ya!

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.976
Well done...

01:00:15.076 --> 01:00:16.378
Scorpion King!

01:00:23.485 --> 01:00:24.987
Enkidu! No!

01:00:26.154 --> 01:00:28.423
They're just horses.
We don't hurt them.

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:34.994
That Akkadian,
he stole you.

01:00:34.996 --> 01:00:37.831
No one stole me.
I left.

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.800
You only have
two commands now.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.569
Protect me,
and obey me.

01:00:42.571 --> 01:00:44.273
Not like that in your books.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.875
Is it?

01:00:50.946 --> 01:00:52.415
I don't like him.

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:46.299
Aqaba. A city.
So many people.

01:01:46.301 --> 01:01:48.500
How do we hire a boat
to cross the sea?

01:01:48.502 --> 01:01:50.305
We sell the horses.

01:02:01.049 --> 01:02:03.085
Fresh fish!
Fresh fish!

01:02:04.485 --> 01:02:05.652
Fresh fish!

01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:42.221
Don't talk to anyone.

01:02:42.223 --> 01:02:44.224
We're not here
to trade in gossip.

01:02:44.226 --> 01:02:46.358
I will not speak
to these strange people

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.262
because I do not know them
and I have nothing to say.

01:02:49.264 --> 01:02:51.665
You! Don't talk at all!

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:54.170
I like to talk.

01:03:14.022 --> 01:03:15.154
Enkidu, no!

01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:17.056
You filthy creature!

01:03:17.058 --> 01:03:18.458
Did you fart?

01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:34.310
Sell the horses. Get to the port, hire
a boat, cross the sea to Amonesh.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.612
I'll meet you at the tomb.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:56.197
Mmm!

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:24.694
Scorpion King!

01:04:27.128 --> 01:04:28.395
Been looking for you.

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.465
Here I am.

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:05.098
Enkidu, take Amina.
I'll meet you at the port.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.168
That way.

01:05:22.284 --> 01:05:25.287
Get him!
I want him alive!

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:36.431
Ya!

01:05:37.866 --> 01:05:39.301
Ah!

01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:41.637
Stop!

01:05:45.639 --> 01:05:46.509
Hyah!

01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:14.770
- You're gonna bleed!
- And you're gonna die.

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:22.811
Ha!

01:06:33.188 --> 01:06:34.690
Ah!

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:38.726
Oh!

01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:43.862
No! Stop!

01:06:46.868 --> 01:06:48.369
Get on!

01:06:57.244 --> 01:06:58.413
Ha!

01:07:03.884 --> 01:07:07.522
Get on!
Jump, Blacksmith! Jump!

01:07:08.255 --> 01:07:10.326
Ya!

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.262
Ha! Hyah!
Are you in?

01:07:16.264 --> 01:07:19.199
- Ha! Ha!
- I told you to stay with Amina!

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.833
And I had to save your life!
Again!

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:22.902
Men!

01:07:22.904 --> 01:07:24.404
Ha!

01:08:05.513 --> 01:08:08.715
- Tarqa!
- <i>King</i> Tarqa.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.520
Son of Balthazar.
King of Nubia.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:45.821
The King of Nubia,
he is your brother?

01:08:47.821 --> 01:08:50.523
Yes. Tarqa.

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:54.495
Son of Balthazar,
the King Warrior?

01:08:57.598 --> 01:09:01.868
He died, fighting for his
people with honor and dignity.

01:09:19.687 --> 01:09:21.756
Let me carry
this burden for you,

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.792
for you have much
to accomplish on this quest.

01:09:38.404 --> 01:09:40.808
I am the sole heir
of Nubia, Blacksmith.

01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:45.013
I am a queen
with no kingdom.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:49.917
Now I know your pain.

01:10:00.562 --> 01:10:01.930
I am sorry for your loss.

01:10:05.066 --> 01:10:07.966
But your choice
is a simple one.

01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:10.972
You can fight on, avenge your
brother and your people.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:13.441
And maybe you will die.

01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:16.011
Or you can turn back now.

01:10:17.579 --> 01:10:19.014
Make a new life for yourself.

01:10:21.715 --> 01:10:25.585
But when you leave this world,
many years from now,

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:27.589
and give a full account
of your life here...

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:32.593
what story would you like
history to remember?

01:10:39.433 --> 01:10:41.503
This is what you
meant about quests?

01:11:29.984 --> 01:11:32.217
So, you're the
famous Scorpion King?

01:11:32.219 --> 01:11:34.686
Someone I used to be.

01:11:34.688 --> 01:11:37.659
But someday you may regain
your kingdom, build it anew.

01:11:38.759 --> 01:11:40.661
There's nothing left
in my kingdom.

01:11:42.129 --> 01:11:45.198
In Aqaba, you saw somebody
you wanted to kill.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.903
And in killing that person,
you'd have likely been killed.

01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:50.505
Yes.

01:11:51.705 --> 01:11:53.674
She killed someone
very close to me.

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:56.678
There are many stories
about vengeance.

01:11:58.545 --> 01:12:00.682
There is honor
in payback.

01:12:13.628 --> 01:12:15.831
The Lost City of Amonesh.

01:12:36.851 --> 01:12:39.818
Enkidu, you will have
to wait for us here.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.723
I cannot protect you
if I'm not with you.

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:46.093
And I cannot obey you
if I cannot hear you.

01:12:47.762 --> 01:12:50.632
- But we'll have torches in there.
- No flames!

01:12:51.732 --> 01:12:53.966
But there's no other way.

01:12:53.968 --> 01:12:58.072
I may have another way.
But you'll have to trust me.

01:13:21.094 --> 01:13:24.031
A tomb. I hate tombs. Ah.

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:31.903
Don't let the fire touch me!
Is the fire touching me?

01:13:31.905 --> 01:13:34.105
No, it's not touching you.

01:13:34.107 --> 01:13:35.741
Yeah.

01:13:35.743 --> 01:13:36.777
Come, Enkidu.

01:13:43.785 --> 01:13:46.985
No fire! No fire!

01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:50.088
Amina! Amina!
Don't make me.

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:51.724
Stop, it's okay.

01:13:53.093 --> 01:13:54.327
It's okay.

01:14:04.871 --> 01:14:06.674
"King Memtep."

01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:11.077
This inscription's
just details of his life.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:14.814
The tomb builders would have
never carved the secret text

01:14:14.816 --> 01:14:16.716
on how to break
the Curse of Anubis

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:20.022
on the walls for robbers
to easily decipher.

01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:22.954
It would have
been hidden,

01:14:22.956 --> 01:14:25.826
or concealed
in the funerary artifacts.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.163
In the sarcophagus?

01:14:30.063 --> 01:14:33.299
No. That's where
the sword was found.

01:14:33.301 --> 01:14:34.966
It would have been separated.

01:14:34.968 --> 01:14:36.971
Everything's been
plundered and robbed.

01:14:41.142 --> 01:14:42.110
The Sphinx.

01:14:45.079 --> 01:14:47.282
An idol full of secrets
and mystery.

01:14:51.018 --> 01:14:53.385
The guardian
of knowledge.

01:14:53.387 --> 01:14:55.086
The Sphinx
dies for truth.

01:14:55.088 --> 01:14:58.224
But this is
an androsphinx,

01:14:58.226 --> 01:15:02.864
the male of the species, known
as the messenger of truth.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:06.868
Break it open.

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:19.147
I'll give it right back.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.849
Okay, I'll bring it back. I promise.

01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:25.120
Bring it back!

01:16:08.396 --> 01:16:11.133
- It's a history written in Sumerian.
- Yes.

01:16:12.266 --> 01:16:14.100
These hieroglyphs
say King Memtep

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.368
was beset by enemies
on all sides.

01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:19.003
He called out to the God
of the Underworld,

01:16:19.005 --> 01:16:22.006
who forged a sword to steal
the souls of his enemies,

01:16:22.008 --> 01:16:25.944
giving King Memtep strength
and power beyond measure.

01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:28.247
And the King grew terrible
in his might,

01:16:28.249 --> 01:16:33.853
for he was cursed and tormented by
the screams of the tortured souls.

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:35.954
King Memtep
returned to Amonesh

01:16:35.956 --> 01:16:39.457
to find his royal concubine
had birthed a girl child.

01:16:39.459 --> 01:16:44.028
His daughter's skin bore the names
of those slain by the sword.

01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:47.533
Anubis told King Memtep
the only way to end the curse

01:16:47.535 --> 01:16:49.502
was to destroy the <i>Book
of Souls</i> with the sword.

01:16:51.004 --> 01:16:53.338
It was the gods' cruel trick
that to save himself,

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.109
the king must end the curse
by killing his only daughter.

01:16:57.111 --> 01:17:00.045
But a powerful mage
saved the girl,

01:17:00.047 --> 01:17:02.280
stealing her away forever.

01:17:02.282 --> 01:17:05.818
And King Memtep went mad
from the curse,

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:09.154
driving the sword
into his own heart.

01:17:09.156 --> 01:17:12.226
So entering his own name
into the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:22.003
King Memtep was your father?

01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:28.375
The mage I thought was my
father raised me as his own.

01:17:31.012 --> 01:17:32.411
He meant to protect me.

01:17:32.413 --> 01:17:35.980
That's impossible.
That would make you...

01:17:35.982 --> 01:17:37.351
I have lived for centuries.

01:17:39.419 --> 01:17:42.223
And I will live
for countless millennia more.

01:17:45.125 --> 01:17:47.896
The only way to break
the Curse of Anubis is to...

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:51.398
I must be destroyed
by the sword.

01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:55.403
The <i>Book of Souls</i>
must be destroyed...

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.038
and the souls freed.

01:18:00.907 --> 01:18:04.143
And I am the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

01:18:04.145 --> 01:18:08.383
<i>The Book of Souls,</i> hidden in
the body of a beautiful woman.

01:18:30.204 --> 01:18:34.075
Men are simple, aren't they?

01:19:10.945 --> 01:19:13.048
The Scorpion King.

01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:11.703
I've sedated him.

01:20:11.705 --> 01:20:16.175
This is the Scorpion King
everyone whispers about.

01:20:16.177 --> 01:20:18.446
Legends always start
with a whisper.

01:20:29.723 --> 01:20:34.126
Hmm. He doesn't look like
very much in these chains.

01:20:34.128 --> 01:20:36.231
Before I take his
head off his shoulders...

01:20:38.632 --> 01:20:40.435
let's see how he fights.

01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:45.403
Alert me when he wakes
from his slumber.

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:47.706
Are you sure
this is wise?

01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.444
Kill him now
and be done with it.

01:20:52.545 --> 01:20:54.712
He's already half dead,
Priestess.

01:20:54.714 --> 01:20:59.385
Half-dead men are dangerous,
especially a man like this.

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:03.692
The jackals want to see this
great warrior killed in battle.

01:21:05.258 --> 01:21:07.494
We must satiate
their bloodlust.

01:21:10.798 --> 01:21:13.702
He is weak and wounded...

01:21:16.704 --> 01:21:18.572
and no match for this sword!

01:21:29.749 --> 01:21:31.151
No!

01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:38.259
Princess Tala.

01:21:45.132 --> 01:21:46.468
I am your queen now.

01:21:50.404 --> 01:21:53.104
If called, are the men
ready to fight?

01:21:53.106 --> 01:21:54.676
The men will fight,
my queen.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.280
What is this?

01:22:02.282 --> 01:22:04.352
The <i>Book of Souls.</i>

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.422
Written on ancient vellum...

01:22:09.789 --> 01:22:13.293
illuminated in the blue light
of the evening sun.

01:22:14.762 --> 01:22:16.197
Such beauty.

01:22:17.831 --> 01:22:20.666
So, you thought
to defeat me

01:22:20.668 --> 01:22:24.772
by destroying the sword,
and with it, my power?

01:22:35.648 --> 01:22:38.186
I see you're a book with
a will of your own.

01:22:39.453 --> 01:22:42.757
Such contempt
in your eyes.

01:22:46.293 --> 01:22:47.695
Burn the bitch.

01:23:24.498 --> 01:23:25.834
Rise, Blacksmith.

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:30.536
Become the Scorpion King again.

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:36.641
We honor the covenant between
the God of Underworld, Anubis,

01:23:36.643 --> 01:23:40.711
and the bearer of his sword,
our God-King Nebserek!

01:23:40.713 --> 01:23:43.649
Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:45.184
Nebserek! Nebserek!

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:47.853
Here,
on this sacred ground,

01:23:47.855 --> 01:23:52.757
we gather at the sacrificial
fires to put forth a ritual...

01:23:52.759 --> 01:23:57.397
Remember who you are,
Scorpion King: demigod,

01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:59.467
the last Akkadian.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:50.782
As written in the prophesies,
the <i>Book of Souls</i> shall burn

01:24:50.784 --> 01:24:51.920
and be thus destroyed.

01:24:52.986 --> 01:24:54.819
Let no man stand
against us!

01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:56.391
I am one man!

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:01.929
But one can stand
against many...

01:25:05.732 --> 01:25:06.700
for a friend.

01:25:16.643 --> 01:25:18.713
Calm your blades, Jackals.

01:25:21.315 --> 01:25:22.917
He's mine!

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:34.395
How was your sleep,
Scorpion King?

01:25:35.795 --> 01:25:36.931
I'm just a blacksmith.

01:25:38.464 --> 01:25:40.767
I admire a man
who stands tall.

01:25:41.634 --> 01:25:43.402
Even when he's overmatched.

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:47.038
The time for
chanting has not yet come.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.640
- Enkidu, it's time.
- The people want...

01:25:49.642 --> 01:25:52.913
I did not protect Amina.
I failed her.

01:25:54.481 --> 01:25:56.047
We have not failed.

01:25:56.049 --> 01:25:57.349
Not yet.

01:25:57.351 --> 01:25:58.649
He threatens my reign.

01:26:01.821 --> 01:26:04.525
You stand
on the ruins of my people.

01:26:05.726 --> 01:26:09.528
Broken many years ago
by your Akkadian Empire.

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:13.532
We were forced
to live like jackals,

01:26:13.534 --> 01:26:14.969
eating scraps
to survive.

01:26:15.835 --> 01:26:17.571
But one jackal...

01:26:18.539 --> 01:26:20.738
was not prepared to slink away,

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:24.544
and grow old,
starving and defeated!

01:26:35.489 --> 01:26:39.623
I dug deep,
deep into the sand

01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:43.494
and found the one thing
that can rebuild an empire.

01:26:44.697 --> 01:26:47.599
Ruled by an eater of souls.

01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:50.836
With this sword,
I am invincible!

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:54.405
Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

01:26:54.407 --> 01:26:56.643
You fear no man.

01:26:57.710 --> 01:27:00.714
- I fear no man.
- I have faith in you, Enkidu.

01:27:01.914 --> 01:27:03.650
Show me who you are.

01:27:04.817 --> 01:27:09.153
This is your time.
This is your moment!

01:27:09.155 --> 01:27:10.788
Amina needs you!

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.795
On my command,
unleash hell!

01:27:16.797 --> 01:27:22.035
Nebserek! Nebserek!
Nebserek! Nebserek!

01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:39.520
No!

01:27:52.499 --> 01:27:54.966
You must believe!

01:27:54.968 --> 01:27:58.836
I cannot fail!

01:27:58.838 --> 01:28:01.775
You cannot burn!
Break it down!

01:28:04.511 --> 01:28:06.110
Amina! I'm coming!

01:28:21.794 --> 01:28:23.864
Ah! Ah!

01:28:24.998 --> 01:28:26.100
Ah!

01:28:38.978 --> 01:28:40.147
Ah!

01:28:58.831 --> 01:29:00.133
Oh!

01:29:20.587 --> 01:29:22.623
Give me your soul, Akkadian!

01:29:24.023 --> 01:29:24.991
Never.

01:29:38.137 --> 01:29:39.639
Hyah!

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.978
Enkidu!

01:29:45.312 --> 01:29:48.616
I cannot fail.

01:29:49.282 --> 01:29:52.250
Must destroy sword!

01:29:57.290 --> 01:30:00.024
- I cannot...
- No!

01:30:00.026 --> 01:30:02.195
...fail!

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.837
Amina!

01:31:12.298 --> 01:31:17.301
If I can't have your soul, Akkadian,
then I will send you to the afterlife.

01:31:17.303 --> 01:31:19.136
No. I create my destiny.

01:31:19.138 --> 01:31:22.340
And I will not die
by your hand.

01:31:22.342 --> 01:31:25.980
But you will!

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.862
No!

01:31:48.834 --> 01:31:53.306
No!

01:33:31.471 --> 01:33:34.208
Break this curse,
Scorpion King.

01:33:50.389 --> 01:33:51.392
I won't hurt you.

01:33:52.392 --> 01:33:54.228
The evil will not rest.

01:33:56.195 --> 01:33:59.432
It will come for the sword
again and again.

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:08.238
I am the sacrifice
that must be made

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.478
to destroy the sword
and free the souls.

01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:19.153
I'm not afraid.

01:34:23.056 --> 01:34:24.258
Is there no other way?

01:34:48.013 --> 01:34:50.183
Thank you for showing me
your world.

01:36:19.172 --> 01:36:20.473
Good-bye, Amina.

01:36:28.714 --> 01:36:32.116
<i>History will
tell of this fearless warrior</i>

01:36:32.118 --> 01:36:34.621
<i>who never forgot
his destiny again.</i>

01:36:35.588 --> 01:36:37.956
<i>He was known by many names:</i>

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:43.094
<i>Akkadian, Assassin, Blacksmith,</i>

01:36:43.096 --> 01:36:45.697
<i>and Liberator of Souls.</i>

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:48.399
<i>But the name
he made for himself</i>

01:36:48.401 --> 01:36:52.239
<i>will be forever etched
in the sands of time:</i>

01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:57.311
<i>Mathayus, the Scorpion King.</i>
