You're really gonna
disrespect that pie like that?

like, does anybody
have a dictionary?

straight pepperoni and cheese.

go there until you
just said it.

count down the days

the days till it happened.

05:03.620 --> 05:04.793

that just

05:04.862 --> 05:07.482
brought it up.

05:07.551 --> 05:09.172
I don't want to bring it up

05:09.241 --> 05:12.310

about it at all, Ron.

05:12.379 --> 05:15.586
Okay, but...

05:15.655 --> 05:19.517
When my father passed away,
everyone reached out to me.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.448
Ron was the only one
that never--

05:22.517 --> 05:25.551
I didn't get a text from him,
I didn't get call, nothing.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.551
It really hurt me.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.827
Well... the reason
I didn't reach out,

05:30.896 --> 05:32.379
the reason I didn't do that

05:32.448 --> 05:34.103
is because I just
didn't know what to say.

05:34.172 --> 05:37.137
Like, what do I say
to someone that, like,

05:37.206 --> 05:42.931
I love no matter what,
but you're the other
person's best friend.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.620

With Sam?

05:44.689 --> 05:45.965

05:46.034 --> 05:48.137

hang out with Sam?

05:48.206 --> 05:50.862

I couldn't deal with that.

05:50.931 --> 05:52.551

a  about that.

gonna be able to come down here.

31:16.310 --> 31:17.448
He made it.

31:17.517 --> 31:19.379
You're an inspiration
to all of us

31:19.448 --> 31:20.862
because of what
you're going through

31:20.931 --> 31:22.034
and the way
you're handling it.

31:22.103 --> 31:23.241
You're here with us
right now

31:23.310 --> 31:24.965

And enjoy it!

31:28.689 --> 31:29.655
Love you, Mike.

31:29.724 --> 31:31.517
Love you guys.

31:31.586 --> 31:32.689
That's good
sparkling water.

31:32.758 --> 31:34.206
That is good sparkling water,
it was.

31:34.275 --> 31:35.896
Mike, like, you were
like my best friend.

31:35.965 --> 31:39.448
And then we like totally
fell off, and we were fighting.

31:39.517 --> 31:40.517
Yep.

31:40.586 --> 31:41.655
I didn't get you.

31:41.724 --> 31:43.275
you, Mike.I didn't!

31:43.344 --> 31:45.034
Mike, I'm not kidding!

31:45.103 --> 31:46.137
We hated each other.

31:46.206 --> 31:47.586
I couldn't even
stand to look at you.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.448
And then all of a sudden,
like, you were Mike again.

31:49.517 --> 31:52.620
So I'm grateful
at the fact that we still
have this relationship.

31:52.689 --> 31:53.724
Thank you.'Cause I love you so much.

31:53.793 --> 31:55.034
I love you, too.

31:55.103 --> 31:55.965
You know, we're talking
about ups and downs,

31:56.034 --> 31:57.482
and there was a point

31:57.551 --> 31:59.379
where I actually
punched you in your face.

31:59.448 --> 32:00.689
Gonna punch me
in the face?

32:00.758 --> 32:01.862
Ohh!

32:01.931 --> 32:04.413
Face-- face-- face.
See what I'm sayin'?

32:04.482 --> 32:06.000
Back fist.And I apologize.

32:06.068 --> 32:07.344
That was awesome.

32:07.413 --> 32:10.137
But at the end of the day,
I could not be more proud

32:10.206 --> 32:13.000
to call Michael Sorrentino
my friend.

32:13.068 --> 32:14.827
It's an honor to
call you my friend now, so...

32:14.896 --> 32:16.620
Aww... love you, too.

32:16.689 --> 32:18.068
I love you.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.724
So, Mike...

32:22.103 --> 32:24.517
The problem with me and Mike
was I always gave him

32:24.586 --> 32:25.931
the benefit of the doubt.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.517
And that's what
always  me.

32:27.586 --> 32:28.862
You're in a great place,

32:28.931 --> 32:31.896
and I respect
where you've gotten to.

32:31.965 --> 32:36.896
But... we have had more downs
than ups, that's for sure.

32:38.482 --> 32:40.103
Holy , here we go again.

32:40.172 --> 32:42.103
Drama, man.
This is gonna be bad.

32:42.172 --> 32:44.586
Since day one,
we've gone at it.

32:44.655 --> 32:47.655
We've had issues
with each other.

32:47.724 --> 32:49.586
Fighting, yelling, screaming.

32:49.655 --> 32:50.862
Do it!

32:50.931 --> 32:52.172
Stop!

32:52.241 --> 32:54.724
Ron, please. Stop.

32:54.793 --> 32:55.724
I didn't like you.

32:57.137 --> 32:59.000
You know, you were
not a good person.

33:01.448 --> 33:02.896
Oh, my God, I hate him.

33:02.965 --> 33:06.103
Buzzkill, relax over there.
Oh, my God.

33:06.172 --> 33:07.724
You're not the person
that I met

33:07.793 --> 33:09.241
when you first
walked into the house.

33:09.310 --> 33:11.827
You became something that I
didn't want to be around,

33:11.896 --> 33:13.724
I didn't want
to associate myself with.

33:13.793 --> 33:17.620
Wait a second. Are you
holding grudges from 2011?

33:17.689 --> 33:20.620
Come on, son.
Get past that .

33:20.689 --> 33:23.103
That wasn't nice.
What the hell?

33:23.172 --> 33:24.586
That's rude.That wasn't nice.

33:24.655 --> 33:26.000
So rude.Don't even go there.

33:26.068 --> 33:27.000
So...

33:27.068 --> 33:28.413
Relax.

33:28.482 --> 33:31.275
But, after seeing you
the last couple months

33:31.344 --> 33:32.482
and talking to you,

33:32.551 --> 33:34.103
I respect where
you've gotten to

33:34.172 --> 33:35.965
and the strength
that you have.

33:36.034 --> 33:37.241
Yeah.Very inspirational, bro.

33:37.310 --> 33:38.275
Thank you, brother.Yes.

33:38.344 --> 33:39.586
Very nice.

33:39.655 --> 33:43.068
"The Situation" tried
to bang my ex-girlfriend

33:43.137 --> 33:45.103
and ratted me out
nine different times.

33:45.172 --> 33:46.172
So that's why,
like, even now,

33:46.241 --> 33:47.655
I keep him at a distance,

33:47.724 --> 33:49.551
and we're gonna see
where it goes.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.689
I really didn't
think it was that bad
between me and you.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.137
I really didn't.

33:54.482 --> 33:55.620
If I was to make a prediction

33:55.689 --> 33:57.482
of how this is going to go,

33:57.551 --> 33:59.448
I'm going to predict
that we're gonna be fighting.

33:59.517 --> 34:01.965
We're gonna have to hear
Jenni bitch about it,

34:02.034 --> 34:03.241
we're gonna have to hear Snooki,

34:03.310 --> 34:05.448
and then Ronnie may cry--
I don't know.

34:05.517 --> 34:07.379
I thought that we always had
these nice, deep conversations.

34:07.448 --> 34:08.758
I really did.

34:08.827 --> 34:11.689
I also predict
that Deena's gonna cry.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.310
She always cries.

34:14.379 --> 34:17.310
Oh, yeah, positivity!
Yeah!

34:17.379 --> 34:18.448
Time to eat.

34:18.517 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, let's eat.

34:20.068 --> 34:22.103
Uhh! Stop!

34:22.172 --> 34:23.758
It's time to drown this bitch.
I'm over her.

34:23.827 --> 34:24.862

34:27.103 --> 34:28.172

♪♪

34:35.448 --> 34:36.620
Hey, Sam.

34:36.689 --> 34:38.793
Sam, you missed a good dinner.

34:38.862 --> 34:40.172
Why are you rubbing her?

34:40.241 --> 34:41.965
I'm glad you guys
worked things out.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.137
Oh, my God.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.344
Let's get in PJs.

34:44.413 --> 34:45.448
Yeah.

34:45.517 --> 34:46.827
And then we're going
to have a wine.

34:46.896 --> 34:48.310
Yes!

34:48.379 --> 34:50.655
I feel like me and Deena
have grown up a lot

34:50.724 --> 34:54.103
since the last time we lived
together in the shore house.

34:54.172 --> 34:56.310
Like, we don't even
chug Baca anymore.

34:56.379 --> 34:58.448
Now we chug wine
and prosecco.

34:58.517 --> 35:00.482
We're more like
a classier meatball.

35:00.551 --> 35:02.482
Cabernet.Amazing.

35:02.551 --> 35:04.931
Oh, that's
a lot of wine.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.275
Whoo!

35:06.344 --> 35:07.655
Oh.That's, like, a lot.

35:07.724 --> 35:09.310
That is. Well, we don't
have to drink it all.

35:09.379 --> 35:11.655
No.Should we go by the pool?

35:11.724 --> 35:13.758
Oh, my God, I want to sit
on the couch and, like, talk.

35:13.827 --> 35:15.448
This is like
my favorite thing.

35:15.517 --> 35:17.793
I'm like a wine
"conndoisseur" now.

35:17.862 --> 35:19.724
I'm domesticated Deena,
bitches.

35:19.793 --> 35:21.379
Excuse me.

35:21.448 --> 35:23.448
Yo, Ronnie
was just violating

35:23.517 --> 35:25.137
the Sammi doll
just now.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.758
Again?Yo!

35:26.827 --> 35:28.000
Should we drown her?Let's do it.

35:28.068 --> 35:30.482
Y'all is crazy.Let's drown the bitch!

35:30.551 --> 35:32.517
Let's  drown
this  doll.

35:32.586 --> 35:34.551
Me and Nicole
hate the Sammi doll.

35:34.620 --> 35:35.965
It just sits there,

35:36.034 --> 35:37.620
doesn't clean the house,
doesn't do anything.

35:37.689 --> 35:39.034
So why do we need
this frickin' doll here?

35:39.103 --> 35:40.827
So we're like,
"Let's get rid of it."

35:40.896 --> 35:42.275
Wait.

35:42.344 --> 35:43.620
Ron! Stop it!

35:43.689 --> 35:45.241
We got this.

35:45.310 --> 35:49.172
She's a heavy mother.  Stop it! Stop!

35:49.241 --> 35:50.689
Do you wanna go
for her legs,
and I'll--

35:50.758 --> 35:52.862
Uhh!

35:52.931 --> 35:54.655
I never once did
anything like that to you.

35:54.724 --> 35:57.103
Threw up in my mouth.Uhh!

35:57.172 --> 35:58.793
Apparently Sammi needs
to lay off the carbs,

35:58.862 --> 36:01.034
because this bitch
is heavy as .

36:01.103 --> 36:03.000
We're gonna throw her right
in the pool, come on.

36:03.068 --> 36:05.482
They can't put her
in the water,
Sammi can't swim.

36:05.551 --> 36:07.896
It's so heavy!  Stop!

36:07.965 --> 36:10.275
I hate this doll.You  whore.

36:10.344 --> 36:14.172
Girl! Relax, it's dead!
It's dead! She's dead!

36:14.241 --> 36:15.965
Damn, everybody fights
with Sam now.

36:16.034 --> 36:17.793
Not just Ronnie
that fights Sam.

36:17.862 --> 36:20.241
Come on.
Get this  thing
out of here. Uhh!

36:20.310 --> 36:21.965
Stop!

36:22.034 --> 36:23.586
It's time to drown this bitch.
I'm over her.

36:23.655 --> 36:25.206
Uhh!

36:25.275 --> 36:26.379
Ohh!

36:26.448 --> 36:27.655
Sammi!

36:27.724 --> 36:30.000
Oh, my God!

36:30.068 --> 36:32.275
You !
She's not even dying.

36:32.344 --> 36:34.586
Oh, she's a floater.

36:34.655 --> 36:36.586
Oh, my God, it's like, why is
this bitch still alive?

36:36.655 --> 36:38.517
This bitch is still here.

36:38.586 --> 36:41.137
Oh, my God, it looks like
a dead  person.

36:41.206 --> 36:43.068
You better be careful,
like, these windows

36:43.137 --> 36:44.793
and , someone's
gonna call the cops.

36:44.862 --> 36:46.379
Man, you guys gotta
dump that body.

36:46.448 --> 36:48.517
You're gonna get caught.What do we do?

36:48.586 --> 36:49.896
Put some concrete
boots on her.

36:49.965 --> 36:51.551
Yeah, tie her--
some bricks to her.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.862
If a helicopter went by,
they would definitely think

36:53.931 --> 36:55.448
there's a dead body
in the pool.

36:55.517 --> 36:59.241
Me and Nicole would be the worst
people at hiding a murder.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.758
Stop!

37:01.827 --> 37:02.965
She's making a noise.

37:03.034 --> 37:04.344
Why is she still alive?
My God.

37:04.413 --> 37:05.758
Wow...Wow...

37:05.827 --> 37:07.965
What is happening
The voice box.

37:08.034 --> 37:09.931
It's the voice box,
it's getting crazy.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.482
She's saying something!

37:11.551 --> 37:13.517
Saying don't kill me.

37:14.862 --> 37:16.793
This doll's clearly
tougher than Sammi.

37:16.862 --> 37:19.275
The frickin' thing
won't  die.

37:20.689 --> 37:23.137
.
I hate her. Bye.

37:23.206 --> 37:25.620
Yo, she is never gonna talk
to any of us, ever again.

37:25.689 --> 37:26.965
Nah, we're done.Not a chance.

37:27.034 --> 37:28.482
Maybe we should
write her a note.

37:28.551 --> 37:30.586
Oh, my God.

37:30.655 --> 37:32.931
Vinnie, jump in the pool.Yeah, right.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.068
Wait, wait, no,
get away from me.

37:35.137 --> 37:36.931
You're so...

37:37.000 --> 37:38.344
Ow! Uhh, .

37:38.413 --> 37:40.172
Oh, my God,
I lost all my rings!

37:40.241 --> 37:41.379
Good.

37:41.448 --> 37:43.068
What happened?!Must have... whoa...

37:43.137 --> 37:44.206
What happened?

37:44.275 --> 37:45.482
I'm not kidding,
where's my rings?

37:45.551 --> 37:46.689
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Wait.

37:46.758 --> 37:47.827
What kind of rings

37:47.896 --> 37:49.517
Yes, I'm missing
the  diamond.

37:49.586 --> 37:50.655
Oh, my God.

37:50.724 --> 37:51.965
Wait, the little--
the rock one?

37:52.034 --> 37:53.310
Yeah...

37:53.379 --> 37:55.068
Yes! Like the real
important thing. .

37:55.137 --> 37:57.275
All right.Could it be
in the  pool?

37:57.344 --> 37:58.758
Oh, God.

37:58.827 --> 38:01.379
Right after Snooks threw
Sammi into the pool,

38:01.448 --> 38:02.862
she loses her ring.

38:02.931 --> 38:06.689
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
karma is not just a club."

38:06.758 --> 38:10.000
I guess we have to
just retrace steps then.

38:10.068 --> 38:11.931
I'm gonna kill myself.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.241
It's all right.
It's here, Nicole. Relax.

38:13.310 --> 38:16.000
Oh, my God.No, I know, I know.
I know.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.344
Don't freak out.
We're gonna find it.

38:18.413 --> 38:19.793
We're scrambling
through the grass,

38:19.862 --> 38:21.482
the furniture's being flipped.

38:21.551 --> 38:23.137
We have flashlights out.

38:23.206 --> 38:25.206
It was almost like we were
looking for El Chapo.

38:25.275 --> 38:27.344
For him, for him.

38:27.413 --> 38:29.482
Ring's  huge.
Where the  is it?

38:29.551 --> 38:32.103
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna kill myself.

38:32.172 --> 38:34.586
Where's my ring?
Oh, my God.

38:34.655 --> 38:36.586
Where the  is it?

38:36.655 --> 38:38.896
We have to find it, Ron.
She's gonna lose it.

38:46.448 --> 38:48.206
♪♪

38:48.275 --> 38:51.310
I'm dying.
I'm literally dying inside.

38:51.379 --> 38:53.827
Where the
is my wedding ring?

38:53.896 --> 38:56.034
We are looking everywhere
for this ring.

38:56.103 --> 39:00.275
I mean, we're combing the entire
backyard for two hours.

39:00.344 --> 39:03.379
Where the
could this  ring be?

39:03.448 --> 39:06.344

39:06.413 --> 39:10.172
Babe, it's not over here.
It's somewhere else.

39:12.827 --> 39:14.551
I've never seen her
so upset.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.620
She's already missing her kids,
she's missing her family.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.241
She-- we have to find
this ring.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.965
Oh, my God.

39:22.034 --> 39:24.482
I have no idea
where her ring is.

39:24.551 --> 39:26.724
I checked so many places.

39:26.793 --> 39:29.379
I lost my ring.
Oh, my God.

39:29.448 --> 39:31.068

39:47.344 --> 39:49.551
This wedding ring thing
is setting her off.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.655
Like, she is triggered,
and she wants to go home.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.896
We need to find this ring

39:54.965 --> 39:56.827
because Nicole
can't leave this house.

39:56.896 --> 40:00.206
I can't believe
I lost my wedding ring.

40:00.275 --> 40:01.793
She's calling her mom.
