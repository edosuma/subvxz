00:27.485 --> 00:29.404
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.157
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.039
Sorry, my--
my arm's asleep.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.498
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.253
-So comfy in your nook.
-You're fine.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.421
No, you're fine.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.937
-What? No, no, no, no.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.356
-No, don't get up. Stay here with me.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.817
Come on.
Bad things happen outside of beds.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.070
Bad things happen inside beds too.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.780
Hmm. Not this bed.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.698
Is that right?

01:13.782 --> 01:16.034
Is that you asking for an encore?

01:30.465 --> 01:31.758
Oh, fuck!

01:31.841 --> 01:35.762
My mom has a follow-up
cardiologist appointment in… four minutes.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.556
I'm so sorry to sleep and run.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.101
No, I'm glad you finally got to sleep.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.270
Yeah, sorry if
I kind of passed out mid-convo.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.439
Yeah, you should be sorry.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.900
I was, uh, spilling all my secrets.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.778
Hey, listen. Um, thank you.
That was-- that was fun.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.530
Oh, no, I don't mean that--

01:54.489 --> 01:58.785
I don't mean that in like
a "wham-bam, thank you… ma'am" way.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.370
No, I get it.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.289
You have a lot on your plate
with your mom and Sonoma,

02:03.373 --> 02:04.457
and I have, um…

02:06.126 --> 02:07.585
I have my own things.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.503
Yeah.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.631
I don't even know why I brought up Sonoma.
That was stupid.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.175
It's not like I can run off
and leave my mom.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.219
I think she'd understand.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.638
You need to live your life.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.474
Yeah, I don't really
get to have one of those right now,

02:22.058 --> 02:27.438
between all the appointments
and follow-ups that I am late for.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.065
-It's a lot, huh?
-Yeah.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.651
I don't wanna say it's a burden, but…

02:32.777 --> 02:35.488
-I'm sorry you have to carry all that.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.450
-No wonder your arm fell asleep.
-Right.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.370
If you ever need anything,
you know where I live.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.205
Really appreciate that.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.710
Take care of yourself, okay?

02:50.336 --> 02:51.171
I'll try.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.724
How did you get to be so amazing?

03:02.807 --> 03:05.560
It's all a ruse.

03:05.643 --> 03:06.644
Seriously though,

03:06.728 --> 03:09.939
to forgive me after what I did.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.150
I should be turning myself in.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.902
-I should be in jail.
-No, no.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.778
No, we--

03:17.030 --> 03:18.531
We all make mistakes. We--

03:21.451 --> 03:23.161
We've all done things that we regret.

03:23.244 --> 03:26.247
Oh, but if you get up,
I have to go back to my parents' house,

03:26.331 --> 03:28.249
and all they wanna do is talk about Steve.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.127
I could see how that could…
could wear on you--

03:31.211 --> 03:33.880
-The thing about Steve is it's--

03:35.089 --> 03:37.425
It's just really hard
not to know what happened.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.179
Maybe it's a good thing that you don't.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.348
Maybe.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.266
My reflex is to drink.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.101
-Yeah, don't do that.
-No, I know.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.647
I just don't know what to do.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.444
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but…

03:56.527 --> 03:58.821
…um, after Ted died,

03:58.905 --> 04:02.242
I went to this grief group thingy.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.035
-You did?
-Yeah.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.746
Begrudgingly and,
uh, with a shitty attitude.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.291
But it… it did help me

04:10.833 --> 04:12.502
to feel less alone.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.088
I don't feel alone right now.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.173
I'm glad.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.433
Hey.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.853
Would it be weird
if I asked to take a bath?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.022
-Yeah.
-Okay.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.983
You still can.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.486
Maybe light a couple of candles,
you know. 

04:40.029 --> 04:41.698
Do you-- do you have any candles?

04:41.781 --> 04:42.907
Under the sink.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.703
Ha! I mean…

04:49.497 --> 04:50.665
-Jesus.
-Ah! Sorry.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.708
Okay.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.427
Mom, there's a leak in the kitchen!

05:02.510 --> 05:04.804
Jesus Christ, Charlie. Do you ever knock?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.391
Hey, can I borrow
your lavender body… wash?

05:10.268 --> 05:11.936
Are you taking a bath?

05:14.897 --> 05:18.026
It's-- it's a normal thing to-- to do.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.827
Methinks the leak's coming from there.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.454
Yes.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.039
-Me's agrees.
-Yeah.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.624
I can take a look at it if you want.
Maybe snake out your pipes.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.834
Again.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.169
I'll go get the toolbox.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.466
Whatever you think is happening
is none of your business.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.925
So it's happening?

05:43.468 --> 05:45.470
Look, Ben has been through a lot.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.098
And, uh, it's good to be there for people.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.600
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

05:51.809 --> 05:52.685
Hey, man.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.731
You mind giving me a hand up there?
I don't know. Get your plumb on.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.651
Yeah, man, let's plumb it out.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.792
Judy.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.251
Hi.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.255
I didn't think I'd see you again
after your last visit.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.258
Thought I might have
freaked you out a little bit.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.259
You did.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.886
But you're back.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.222
Figured it can't hurt to try, right?

06:29.889 --> 06:31.641
Good. Good.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.434
<i>Let's take a look at this bad boy.</i>

06:35.353 --> 06:38.314
Hey, uh, you know,
I never got a chance to talk to you

06:38.398 --> 06:40.858
about showing up
at your house all…

06:41.442 --> 06:42.777
…loosey-goosey the other day.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.320
You mean totally shit-faced?

06:45.071 --> 06:47.490
-Yeah, that works too.
-Yeah.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.576
Don't worry about it, man.
I-- I didn't tell my mom.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.246
Thanks. I appreciate that.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.749
You're a good man, Charlie Brown. Yeah.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.543
-You probably get that a lot, huh?
-Yeah.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.753
Um, you actually said it to me that day.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.965
-I did?
-Yeah.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.300
-Come on.
-I can't come on. You said it.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.597
Uh, look, I really wanna apologize.
That wasn't me.

07:11.681 --> 07:15.810
I was pretty messed up,
dealing with my brother, and…

07:17.270 --> 07:18.688
I'm-- I'm really not that guy.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.775
Well, it's okay.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.446
I did a couple fucked-up things
after my dad died.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.030
So I get it.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.367
Hey.

07:32.118 --> 07:32.994
YOLO, right?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.621
People don't really say that anymore, man.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.333
All right, how about
we get jiggy with this drain, huh?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.006
-Sheesh McGeesh.
-Wow.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.550
And then,
after the first three cycles of chemo,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.802
we'll go back and do another PET-CT scan

07:49.886 --> 07:51.888
to see how your body's responding.

07:51.971 --> 07:52.972
Just let me…

07:58.853 --> 08:00.104
Three cycles.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.856
How long does that take?

08:01.939 --> 08:03.983
Each cycle is about one month.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.446
-And then that's it?
-Depending on how your body responds.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.072
We-- we may need to do more. Here.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.949
Oh, thanks.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.535
-Do you want a piece of gum?
-Uh, no, um, I'm good.

08:14.619 --> 08:18.706
So, Judy, the next few months
may be very challenging.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.168
Do you have anybody
who can help? Any family?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.003
-I have a mom.
-Great. Is she local?

08:24.086 --> 08:26.631
-She's in jail.
-Okay.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.425
Uh, is there a friend you can ask?

08:30.009 --> 08:33.971
There is, but I, um…
I really don't wanna be a burden.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.892
Forgive my candor, but this is one time
in life where it's okay to be selfish.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.852
Yeah, but I'm really not that guy.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.063
Well, you might have to be.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.439
Not to freak you out again,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.608
but this part of the process
is very grueling.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.151
You will need help.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.529
Right, but, like,

08:50.363 --> 08:52.698
it's not impossible to do by myself.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.116
I <i>could </i>do it, right?

08:54.200 --> 08:57.161
You could,
but it really isn't the best plan.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.583
Oh, shit.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.586
Do you have a trash?

09:05.670 --> 09:08.673
-Ooh, that's a lot of hair.
-Ugh! That's a nightmare.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.926
It's not even mine.
A witch lived here before me.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.303
-Oh. A good witch or a bad witch?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.305
Oh, you know, a little of both.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.390
She was bi.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.308
-Just in case.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.895
Well, good news is we found the problem.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.815
-Bad news is it is above my pay grade.
-Oh.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.857
Yeah, it's weird.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.151
There's, like, a huge hole
in one of the pipes.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.280
Like, totally corroded like something
just burned right through it.

09:40.246 --> 09:44.834
Huh. Oh, that is weird.
That is-- that is-- that's so weird.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.544
Maybe that witch
used this as her cauldron.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.837
Oh.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.756
A little eye of newt
and tail of rat action, right?

09:52.425 --> 09:55.136
-Come into my cauldron!
-Eww!

09:55.219 --> 09:56.679
Right.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.598
Oh, God. I'm gonna call a plumber.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.815
Judy, where have you been?

10:07.898 --> 10:09.734
-Sorry. I--
-I'm really freaking out!

10:09.817 --> 10:10.818
What? Why?

10:10.901 --> 10:13.571
-Ben is the one that hit us.
-What?

10:13.654 --> 10:17.283
Mm-hmm. And we slept together,
which was good.

10:17.366 --> 10:21.370
Which is bad because now
he's upstairs fixing our leaky rathole.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.997
-We have a leak?
-Yeah!

10:23.080 --> 10:24.999
-Keep up, Judy.
-I'm sorry. It's a lot.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.292
Yeah, this is what I'm saying!

10:26.375 --> 10:28.044
There's way too fucking much!

10:29.128 --> 10:32.214
Okay, well, then maybe it's not
the, um, best time for me

10:32.298 --> 10:33.424
to tell you what I was--

10:33.507 --> 10:34.925
Tell me what, Judy?

10:36.010 --> 10:36.927
I have…

10:41.432 --> 10:44.810
…to go with Michelle to Sonoma
for three months.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.479
I'm sorry. You have to do what with who?

10:46.562 --> 10:49.315
Michelle. She's opening a restaurant
next to this organic winery,

10:49.398 --> 10:51.442
and I guess she wants me
to come with her and help.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.027
Okay, so you dated for what, a week?

10:53.110 --> 10:55.196
And now you are running away with her
for three months?

10:55.279 --> 10:57.698
Mm-hmm. Maybe longer
depending on how things go.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.785
You know, it's not something
that she can do alone. She needs help.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.537
All right,
so, when are you leaving?

11:03.621 --> 11:07.875
She said that, um, sooner is better,
so I don't think it can wait.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.336
-Wait. What about your job?
-That's fine. I got fired.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.504
Oh.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.381
-Jesus, this is a lot.
-Right?

11:13.464 --> 11:14.924
-That's what I was thinking.
-Okay.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.759
-Hey-hey!
-Hi!

11:16.842 --> 11:19.470
-Oh. Hey, Judy.
-Hey.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.015
-Did you, uh, tell her that…
-Hmm.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.685
I was… You know…

11:25.768 --> 11:27.103
-I did.
-She did.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.021
-Oh, phew! Okay, good.
-No, it's good.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.857
-It's fine.
-No, it's bad.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.734
Oh.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.028
I should have told you
that day at the hospital. Sorry.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.613
He had just found out about Steve, so…

11:37.697 --> 11:39.865
Yeah, well, there's no excuse for that.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.410
Well, I think it's okay. We're fine.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.079
Oh, my God. It's okay. Everyone is okay.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.497
Everybody's fine.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.791
I'm so sorry, guys.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.585
-You guys are too good to me.
-Anything we can do to help.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.296
-Whatever you need.
-Oh, boy.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.257
I mean, is that plumber on his way?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.718
'Cause I got a little leak
of my own going here.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.678
-Hey, you can cry if you want to.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.847
No, no, no, I'm good. I'm good.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.391
I'm a wreck!

12:05.474 --> 12:07.226
I mean…

12:07.810 --> 12:12.189
There's just so--
so many feelings, you know?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.071
Ow!

12:19.655 --> 12:20.948
It hurts.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.785
I feel sad,
and I've just never been sadder.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.413
It's just
I'm starting to realize that… 

12:28.330 --> 12:30.750
I got a lot of anger!

12:31.292 --> 12:35.838
Anger is a perfectly natural response
to such a horrific, gruesome death.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.841
I just keep thinking, what kind of
person would do this, you know?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.802
Don't they have any remorse?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.930
-Oh, I'm sure they do. Yes, of course.
-Oh, I'm sure they do. 

12:45.014 --> 12:49.185
Probably a monster
to not feel the depth of pain.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.854
-What an awful thing to happen.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.647
I just have so many questions.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.403
But I just heard
that the FBI wants to talk to us.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.739
-So maybe we'll get some answers.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.407
-I don't know.
-Oh, great!

13:03.491 --> 13:04.950
-Yay!
-Great!

13:05.034 --> 13:06.243
-Wow!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.871
-Emotional high five, man.
-Yes!

13:08.954 --> 13:10.164
That's good to hear.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.666
And we are glad to have you here, Ben.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.543
It is so important to have people

13:14.627 --> 13:16.879
you could lean on
when things feel so bleak.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.423
Unless they're going to Sonoma.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.218
-Uh, you're going to Sonoma?
-Oh, no.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.011
No, Judy is for three months.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.722
I don't feel like
that's really grief-specific.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.266
-So someone else can go.
-I'll go.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.478
Today is a special day for me.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.940
It's the 20th anniversary of Burt's death.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.777
My husband. He took his own life.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.573
Are you doing anything
to mark the occasion, Yolanda?

13:44.657 --> 13:49.078
Well, I usually go
to our favorite karaoke bar.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.996
Burt was a singer too.

13:51.789 --> 13:52.706
But it closed.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.417
-Well, that's a bummer.
-It's okay.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.337
I can mark the occasion
at home by myself too.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.421
Have fun.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.216
You shouldn't have to be by yourself.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.760
Doesn't Henry have a karaoke machine?

14:05.761 --> 14:06.595
I'm gonna kill you.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.765
-Sibilant sounds.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.725
Malevolence.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.644
Pestilence.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.896
-Succubus.
-Okay.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.816
We're done with the mic testing, okay?
Thank you, Shandy.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.068
Put it down. Put it down.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.280
Walk away.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.031
Thanks, hon.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.703
Oh, you just had to.
You just <i>had</i> to volunteer, huh?

14:30.786 --> 14:33.956
Oh, I felt bad. Yolanda really
seemed like she needed a friend.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.457
Yeah, well, so could I.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.293
What's that supposed to mean?

14:37.918 --> 14:40.838
It just means
that I don't have the bandwidth

14:40.921 --> 14:42.840
to be throwing a party
for a dead guy right now.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.342
I mean, I've got
a giant leak in my kitchen

14:45.426 --> 14:48.470
and not to mention
the FBI crawling up my crack.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.266
Oh, don't worry about that.
I went and spoke to Glenn.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.684
Who?

14:53.767 --> 14:56.937
-Agent Moranis, the FBI guy.
-What? Why?

14:57.021 --> 15:00.566
To imply that the Greeks
were involved in our hit-and-run,

15:00.649 --> 15:04.194
which implies that maybe they killed Steve
because he was stealing money from them.

15:04.278 --> 15:08.324
So you went and lied
to the MVP of the FBI?

15:08.407 --> 15:10.075
It wasn't lying. It was theorizing.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.119
But now you've probably
made him more suspicious

15:12.202 --> 15:14.705
by trying to make us look less suspicious.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.915
I was trying to help.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.208
But that's-- that's what you do.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.337
You just don't think things through, Judy.
Whatever, I don't--

15:21.420 --> 15:25.007
You go have fun on your sexy joyride
to Sonoma. I'll be fine here.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.719
It's not really a joyride.
It's actually gonna be pretty grueling.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.220
-What's gonna be grueling?
-Oh.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.014
Uh, Judy is leaving us

15:32.097 --> 15:34.934
to go open a restaurant
with her friend Michelle.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.143
-Bad idea.
-Mm-hmm.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.312
The restaurant business is a losing game.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.189
The odds of survival are very slim.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.067
-Shandy gets it.
-Somebody has to beat the odds, right?

15:43.150 --> 15:46.362
-It's your funeral.
-It's your funeral.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.471
-This isn't gonna be a long party, right?

16:12.554 --> 16:15.057
Look how happy she is. Come on.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.267
Look how happy I am.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.521
I see it.
I know there's a big smile under there.

16:20.604 --> 16:21.981
-Ladies.
-Hi.

16:22.064 --> 16:22.898
Hey.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.026
For what it's worth, I think it was
very kind of you to do this for Yolanda.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.820
-Didn't have a choice.
-Oh, happy to do it.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.196
That's just the thing, isn't it?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.281
-It feels good to help other people.
-Hmm.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.326
It's my dirty little secret.
It's better to give than to receive.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.454
That may have come out wrong.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.124
-No. No. Mm-mm.
-Maybe.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.253
-Oh, thank God.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.548
Oh, thank you, everyone, thank you.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.634
Uh, excuse me. You know,
uh, I'm a little parched.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.678
So am I.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.810
Hi. There's our songbird.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.979
Brought you some water.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.897
Oh, thank you.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.151
I just needed a minute to collect myself.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.736
Yeah.

17:09.820 --> 17:10.779
Is that Burt?

17:11.363 --> 17:15.159
Oh, look at him.
He has such kind eyes.

17:15.868 --> 17:16.910
Doesn't he?

17:18.412 --> 17:19.955
You know, it's funny.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.668
You'd think, after all this time,
I'd be done crying over him, but…

17:27.880 --> 17:28.922
here we are.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.175
He was clearly a very special guy.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.134
No, he wasn't.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.804
Child, he was
as ordinary as they come. 

17:36.305 --> 17:40.100
He used to joke that
what he lacked in personality,

17:40.184 --> 17:41.769
I made up for in looks.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.729
He was not wrong.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.649
Well, I'm sure he had his charms.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.778
He really didn't. Mm-mm.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.615
And I loved that about him.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.492
He was

17:57.367 --> 18:00.204
steady and predictable.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.208
That's why it's…

18:04.708 --> 18:07.419
…it's so hard to believe that he chose--

18:07.503 --> 18:09.671
He chose to do what he did.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.591
He may not have felt like he had a choice.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.968
At least not a better one.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.472
I just wish I had known
how much he was suffering.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.518
I'd have moved
heaven and earth to help him.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.436
I'm sure he knew that.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.648
Then why didn't he ask me?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.318
Maybe he couldn't.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.155
Maybe.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.243
Judy.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.454
Honey, thank you so much for all of this.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.706
It was so special.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.376
Of course!

18:48.794 --> 18:51.004
-Hey.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.883
You have a great time in Sonoma.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.469
-Oh.
-I hear it's like heaven up there.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.680
-Wow.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.473
Yeah, I hope so.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.058
-Judy?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.935
-Your friend's here.
-My friend?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.064
-Hey, Michelle.
-Hey, Jen.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.567
-So, big news about Sonoma.
-Oh!

19:11.650 --> 19:14.486
Michelle, you're here! We're all here.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.821
Yeah, for now.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.657
-What?
-Mom, do we have any duct tape?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.577
And some sturdy toenail clippers.
It's for a game.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.705
Yeah, I'll see what we have.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.623
Excuse me, Michelle.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.128
Can we go somewhere?

19:31.211 --> 19:33.046
Yeah, of course. 

19:33.130 --> 19:35.757
-Is everything okay?
-No, not-- not really.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.385
Um, I'm sorry
for just showing up like this.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.054
-No, I said if you ever needed anything.
-Um…

19:41.722 --> 19:44.099
I do. I do.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.601
Um, I need to apologize.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.477
For what?

19:49.521 --> 19:53.358
I heard what you said last night
when you thought I was sleeping.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.194
About your…

19:55.277 --> 19:57.613
Oh.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.157
Oh.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.327
I'm sorry. I-- I don't know
why I didn't say anything.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.411
I-- I should have.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.581
-I just kind of froze in the moment and--
-It's okay.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.919
No, no, it's not okay. It's gross.
Who does that to somebody they care about?

20:12.002 --> 20:16.048
Oh, please. Who brings up their cancer
while they're naked in bed? That's gross.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.758
I mean, do you wanna talk about it?

20:17.841 --> 20:21.053
We can, or-- or you don't have
to talk about it, but do you--

20:21.929 --> 20:23.722
Do you need someone to…

20:24.473 --> 20:25.807
I know you have Jen, but…

20:27.351 --> 20:28.352
Yeah.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.604
Yeah, I do.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.066
-Do you mind if I ask what kind?
-Cervical.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.693
It, uh…

20:36.777 --> 20:39.279
It's, uh, spread to my liver.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.282
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.034
It's, uh, pretty sucky.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.663
Yeah, that's the suckiest.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.293
Well, I'm here, okay?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.545
If there's anything I can do…

20:57.047 --> 21:00.175
You can invite me to Sonoma

21:01.009 --> 21:02.886
when you open your new place.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.012
I will.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.808
You know, I talked to my mom about it,
and she was, um…

21:08.850 --> 21:10.852
I mean, I guess the word is supportive.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.020
-Really?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.523
-Yeah.
-Look at that!

21:14.606 --> 21:16.608
Sometimes people can surprise you.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.945
-I got you something.
-What?

21:20.028 --> 21:22.656
It's small, and it's dumb,

21:22.739 --> 21:25.325
but I thought it couldn't hurt.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.538
Thank you.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.250
Yeah, they say
amethyst is good for healing.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.628
I think it's helping already.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.353
How you doing?

22:19.796 --> 22:21.673
Willie Nelson knows, man.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.258
He does.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.218
Free Willy!

22:25.302 --> 22:26.928
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.348
-What are you doing here?
-I needed to see you.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.894
Hey, we-- we talked to the FBI, FYI.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.103
Okay. Come on, let's go.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.647
-No, I didn't even get to the bridge.
-Show's over, okay?

22:37.731 --> 22:38.815
-So, what?

22:40.609 --> 22:42.527
-He drowned.
-What?

22:43.653 --> 22:46.156
Steve drowned.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.910
It wasn't the blow to the head
that killed him.

22:55.415 --> 22:56.416
Oh, my God.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.543
That's a pretty awful way to go.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.628
Yeah, it is.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.881
<i>What did you do?</i>

23:07.636 --> 23:08.887
Well, you were right.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.890
It's better not to know.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.935
-Oh, crap.
-No, it's fine.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.937
-No, Ben. Don't. Don't worry about it.
-I got it.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.231
Don't! Ben!

23:21.650 --> 23:22.734
<i>Judy!</i>

23:22.818 --> 23:23.693
Judy!

23:23.777 --> 23:25.987
-Judy, help!
-What happened?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.072
Ben!

23:28.698 --> 23:31.660
-Fuck. Come over here, come on.
-I got it.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.702
Come on.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.787
Come here.

23:33.870 --> 23:37.416
-Here, we got ya.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.251
-All right. Okay.
-Upsy-daisy.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.172
-You got him? Okay.
-Yep.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.216
All right. Look, you don't-- 

23:46.299 --> 23:47.926
-Just sit down.
-Okay.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.636
Boom.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.763
All right,
I'm gonna get some towels. Oh, jeez.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.349
-Uh, just please get rid of everybody.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.022
-What the hell is wrong with you?

24:02.816 --> 24:04.734
Uh…

24:04.818 --> 24:08.113
-I know how this looks.
-I thought you said you weren't that guy.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.949
Listen, buddy--

24:11.032 --> 24:13.326
I'm not your buddy. You fucking loser.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.079
I'm so sorry.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.833
You need to own up to your shit, dude.
And stay the fuck away from my mom.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.847
Hi. How's Ben?

24:33.930 --> 24:36.308
He, uh, he left in a Lyft.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.563
That was a total waking nightmare.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.732
-Yeah, it was a little triggering.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.942
God, it's just-- it's torture.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.737
I wanna help him.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.158
I mean, I fucking owe him that
after what I did. I--

24:54.826 --> 24:56.620
I let him drown, Judy.

24:56.703 --> 24:57.954
-Ben?
-No.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.498
Steve.

25:00.373 --> 25:04.336
I mean, I-- I could have helped him.
I-- I could have saved him, but…

25:04.920 --> 25:06.922
-You froze.
-Yeah.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.510
And if I was a better person,
I would be there

25:12.093 --> 25:14.763
for the man
whose life I fucking destroyed.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.806
-It's too much.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.226
I mean, other people would do it.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.102
-You know, you would.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.605
I mean, you did.
You were that person for me.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.150
I'm just too fucking shitty to even try.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.783
What if I needed you
to be that person for me?

25:35.367 --> 25:36.535
W-what do you mean?

25:39.120 --> 25:41.248
I have cancer.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.292
I said that I didn't, but I do.

25:44.960 --> 25:45.794
I have it.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.422
Why-- why would you--

25:49.506 --> 25:52.217
Because I didn't want you
to blame yourself.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.386
Oh, my God.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.056
That's why I said
I was going to Sonoma. I just

25:59.224 --> 26:01.851
wanted to do the treatment alone,
so I don't burden you,

26:01.935 --> 26:04.604
'cause I know after everything,
especially with your mom. I just--

26:04.688 --> 26:06.606
Fuck you, Judy!

26:07.399 --> 26:09.693
-What?
-I know I said I was a shitty person.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.570
But you really think that I'm that shitty?

26:12.153 --> 26:13.697
-No. Oh, it's not about--
-Listen to me!

26:13.780 --> 26:15.824
You are <i>not</i> a burden.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.493
You are my fucking heart.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.329
And I would do anything for you.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.872
Anything.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.083
Do you understand me?

26:26.793 --> 26:27.877
I'm scared.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.091
I know. I know.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.553
It's gonna be okay.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.597
I promise, all right?

26:39.848 --> 26:42.225
-I just feel really scared.
-I know.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.728
-Oh, I got you, girl. I got you.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.146
It'll be okay.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.412
Hey.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.249
Oh, hey. What's happening?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.376
Uh…

27:08.460 --> 27:10.962
I'm sorry to show up like this.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.090
-Yeah, you're a little wet.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.468
Yeah, um,

27:16.551 --> 27:20.305
you know when you came over
to see me the other day?

27:20.388 --> 27:21.306
Yeah.

27:21.389 --> 27:24.559
And, uh,
and you returned the-- the bird?

27:25.810 --> 27:26.645
Yeah.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.940
The truth is…

27:32.692 --> 27:33.735
I-- I…

27:35.654 --> 27:37.697
I don't know how to do this.

27:40.033 --> 27:40.867
I…

27:42.327 --> 27:43.703
need help.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.375
I'm an alcoholic, and I need help.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.796
Yeah, let's--
let's go get you some help, okay?

27:52.879 --> 27:54.130
-Okay.
-Yeah.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.340
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

27:55.423 --> 27:58.218
-I really, really appreciate it.
-Yeah, man, I got you.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.136
Hey, uh, you mind if I ask?

28:00.220 --> 28:02.847
The bird. Where'd you get it from?

28:02.931 --> 28:05.058
Henry. Jen Harding's son.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.935
Yeah, Judy made it for him.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.397
Did she?

28:15.193 --> 28:17.737
-Here you go.
-This frittata is really good.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.447
-It's so fluffy.
-Hmm!

28:19.531 --> 28:21.116
Oh, I'm gonna try not to be offended

28:21.199 --> 28:23.451
at how surprised
you sound by that.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.828
Oh, by the by,

28:24.911 --> 28:29.457
I made us a shared schedule
of all of your doctor's appointments.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.793
-Aww!
-So we can keep the shit tight.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.503
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.256
-Hey, morning.
-Hi! Good morning.

28:36.339 --> 28:40.176
I, uh, I made a surprisingly good frittata
if anyone's interested.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.470
No, thank you.
I don't need a hot breakfast.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.390
-Then how about cereal?
-Eh, it's like cold soup.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.937
Holy shit!

28:51.896 --> 28:53.189
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

29:01.531 --> 29:04.033
Wow. This place is a real death trap.
