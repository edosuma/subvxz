Has he been down here yet?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.523
Who are you talking about?

01:29.556 --> 01:31.592
Who am I talking about?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.694
Well, if you don't know,
how can I help you.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.498
I am talking about
the Director, Joel Berry.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.301
He's makin' the television
commercial for The Chronicle.

01:41.334 --> 01:42.869
I heard something about that.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.905
He has been scouring
the building looking

01:44.938 --> 01:47.741
for the perfect Chronicle
employee to star in it.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.475
But he hasn't found me yet.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.680
Well, in that dress, I don't
think how he can miss you.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.216
Do you like it?

01:56.249 --> 01:58.351
Oh, I hope Mr. Berry does.

01:58.384 --> 01:59.920
I‐I followed him around
all morning

01:59.953 --> 02:02.589
but I wasn't able
to catch his eye.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.526
Y‐you'd would think that a
nationally syndicated columnist

02:05.559 --> 02:07.561
would be able
to attract his attention

02:07.594 --> 02:08.794
but no!

02:11.732 --> 02:14.701
So I ran out
and got this dress.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.236

02:16.269 --> 02:17.604

Maybe the, the director
w‐will notice you

03:11.525 --> 03:13.827

put you in the commercial

13:27.073 --> 13:28.909
Joel, could I have a second?

13:28.942 --> 13:30.911
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Lar.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.113
Uh, don't worry. He'll get it.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.381
I've been working
with him myself.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.985
Just tell him, "Less knees,
more hips." That should do it.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.923
Less knees, more hips.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.158
Got it.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.259
Thanks, babe.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.632
Balki, uh...

13:51.665 --> 13:54.300
...I understand you've been
working with your cousin.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.103
Oh, yes. He, he has
been very helpful.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.438
He taught me the difference

13:58.471 --> 14:00.273
between just delivering the mail

14:00.306 --> 14:03.644
and being an actor
who is playing the part

14:03.677 --> 14:07.347
of a person
delivering the m‐m‐mail‐l‐l.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.052
I see, uh...

14:12.085 --> 14:14.988
...Balki, just forget
everything he told you, alright.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.958
A‐and just simply,
just simply deliver the mail.

14:21.562 --> 14:23.163
Roll tape.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.899
And... action.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.205
Here's your mail, Mr. Appleton.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.075
I did it! I did it!
Didn't I do it?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.343
Cut.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.214
Balki, you said
your line very well.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.449
But now you have to
let me do my part.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.553
Uh, that is why we're here.

14:46.587 --> 14:49.422
Of course, oh,
I'm sorry. You're right.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.592
No, no, no, no, no. It's fine.
It's fine. Come on over here.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.561
Here we go.
Back to the table and the mail.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.098
Alright, and...

14:58.131 --> 14:59.332
Roll tape.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.235
Larry... that's my job.

15:03.704 --> 15:05.105
Then lets get with it, Miles.

15:08.642 --> 15:09.943
Roll tape.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.479
And... action.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.652
Here's your mail, Mr. Appleton.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.086
Thanks, Balki.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.157
Here, at the "Chicago Chronicle"

15:24.190 --> 15:26.192
we work hard every day.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.293
Cut!

15:30.496 --> 15:31.932
What the hell was that?

15:32.766 --> 15:34.668
What did I do? Did I...

15:34.701 --> 15:38.071
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not, not, not you, him.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.140
Uh, what was that voice?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.208
What, what happened
to your regular voice?

15:42.242 --> 15:44.310
That was my regular voice...

15:44.344 --> 15:46.412
...modulated to
performance level.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.384
Well, don't modulate.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.219
Just, just speak.

15:56.422 --> 15:57.357
Okay.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.327
If that's what you want.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.729
Indulge me, hmm?

16:02.763 --> 16:04.330
Okay, Balki, here we go.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.166
Back to the table.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.468
And... the mail.

16:08.502 --> 16:09.435
Alright.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.473
From the top.

16:13.507 --> 16:16.142
Roll tape. And settle.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.110
[Joel]
Action.

16:20.514 --> 16:22.415
Here's your mail, Mr. Appleton.

16:22.448 --> 16:23.517
Thanks, Balki.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.553
Here at the "Chicago Chronicle"

16:26.587 --> 16:28.589
we work hard every day.

16:28.622 --> 16:30.490
But, hey...

16:30.524 --> 16:33.426
...that doesn't mean
we're not fun people.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.395
Cut! Cut! Cut!

16:37.564 --> 16:40.466
Uh... where did those
words come from?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.468
You see, "fun people"
isn't in my script.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.537
Yeah, but they...

16:43.570 --> 16:47.273
I was having trouble
with the lines you gave me.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.643
They didn't... pop.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.616
Just... say the lines
the way they are written.

16:55.649 --> 16:57.150
Hmm?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.185
Balki, here we go.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.355
One more time. And... the mail.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.329
Let's try it one more time.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.031
Roll tape again.

17:11.732 --> 17:14.233
And... action.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.739
There's your mail, Mr. Appleton.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.473
‐ Cut.
‐ No! No!

17:22.474 --> 17:24.511
No, y‐you can't say "cut."

17:24.545 --> 17:26.780
You see, t‐t‐that's my job.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.482
Yes, but...

17:29.516 --> 17:31.351
...he said "There's your mail"

17:31.384 --> 17:33.419
instead of "Here's your mail."

17:33.453 --> 17:35.756
And I, I thought we were
sticking to the script.

17:35.789 --> 17:38.224
Oh! Oh! Oh! I‐I'm so sorry!

17:38.258 --> 17:41.695
No. Balki, Balki, Balki,
you're doing fine.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.231
Larry... let's take a break,
huh?

17:46.432 --> 17:48.502
I think I need a
creative meeting over here.

17:51.872 --> 17:53.540
Look, I think I have a solution.

17:55.776 --> 17:59.479
Lar, I‐I think I have
a solution of my own.

17:59.513 --> 18:02.683
So w‐w‐we really won't need you
for this meeting. Hmm?

18:13.493 --> 18:16.296
Okay. We'll try it
your way first.

18:22.903 --> 18:25.506
The director seems
upset with someone.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.240
I'm doing my best, cousin.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.909
Don't you worry, Balki.

18:28.942 --> 18:32.646
If they decide not to use you
in this commercial, I walk.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.327
Well, Mary Anne, let's help
clean up before we go.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.262
‐ Oh, no, no, no!
‐ No, no. no, no.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.496
We do that.

18:50.531 --> 18:52.332
Wait. Isn't that
the Chronicle building?

18:52.365 --> 18:54.668
‐ Cousin, it's our commercial!
‐ Uh.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.702
Uh, we don't need to see that.

18:55.736 --> 18:57.237
‐ Oh, yes, we do!
‐ Yes, we do.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.639
We haven't seen it yet.

19:01.675 --> 19:03.710
Here's your mail, Mr. Appleton.

19:03.744 --> 19:05.879
Hi. I'm Balki Bartokomous.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.681
And I just delivered the mail

19:07.714 --> 19:09.816
to a reporter
here at the Chronicle.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.518
And If he were not so busy

19:11.552 --> 19:13.286
writing an article
for today's paper

19:13.319 --> 19:15.556
he would tell you that
here at the Chronicle

19:15.589 --> 19:18.258
we work hard everyday
to bring you the news

19:18.291 --> 19:19.492
with a friendly touch.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.796
So, join our friendly family

19:22.829 --> 19:24.831
every morning
with the Chronicle.

19:24.865 --> 19:26.867
[speaker on TV]
The Chicago Chronicle.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.703
News with a friendly touch.

19:31.772 --> 19:34.741
‐ Balki, you were wonderful!
‐ Oh, I...

19:34.775 --> 19:36.543
Cousin Larry was good.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.912
Was Larry in it?

19:42.516 --> 19:44.751
Of course he was.

19:44.785 --> 19:46.753
And you were very good, too.

19:46.787 --> 19:48.855
I mean, I‐It's hard
to just sit there

19:48.889 --> 19:50.423
and not say anything.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.394
I‐I mean, but what we could see
in your face

19:54.427 --> 19:57.898
expressed this whole kind of a,
a range of, of emotion.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.366
And, and the way
you took the mail.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.202
Well, you made it look so easy.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.473
Do you think we should go now?

20:07.508 --> 20:08.609
Yes, I do.

20:10.811 --> 20:12.879
Thanks for a, a great evening.

20:12.913 --> 20:13.980
It was a great night.

20:14.014 --> 20:16.683
And, Larry, you were... great.

20:18.652 --> 20:19.620
Goodnight.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.590
Oh.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.372
‐ Cousin, you're upset.
‐ No, I'm fine.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.846
Now, cousin, ever since we
finished making that commercial

20:45.879 --> 20:47.948
you've been on an antacid binge.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.352
Don't you think
it would make you feel better

20:52.385 --> 20:54.487
to talk about it?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.056
When Jennifer and Mary Anne
left for Paris

20:56.089 --> 20:58.659
I was Larry Appleton, star.

20:58.692 --> 21:02.428
By the time they got back, I was
Larry Appleton, bit player.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.965
Cousin, you're at least
a two‐bit player.

21:07.968 --> 21:12.305
Balki, I told everyone
I was gonna be a big star.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.908
I even practiced my autograph.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.610
"Love ya. Larry A."

21:19.412 --> 21:22.482
I lost my part
in the first five minutes.

21:22.516 --> 21:23.784
But, cousin,
that's just because they

21:23.817 --> 21:25.385
"Went a different way" with it.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.291
Balki, that's Hollywood talk
for getting fired.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.628
Now when my friends look at me
all they'll see is

21:34.661 --> 21:36.597
Larry Appleton, the jerk.

21:38.732 --> 21:39.800
Cousin, you...

21:41.101 --> 21:43.937
...you underestimate
your friends.

21:43.970 --> 21:48.542
We don't see that, that
ridiculous Larry Appleton.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.877
Not for a second.

21:50.911 --> 21:52.646
‐ You don't?
‐ Well, maybe for a second.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.681
‐ Ah‐huh.
‐ But...

21:54.715 --> 21:56.650
Cousin,
when your friends look at you

21:56.683 --> 22:01.021
we see... Larry Appleton,
the good friend.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.790
And Larry Appleton,
the kind person.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.691
And Larry Appleton

22:04.725 --> 22:08.629
who, who is always there
when you need him.

22:08.662 --> 22:10.664
And, and Larry Appleton

22:10.697 --> 22:14.968
who never tears the tags
off of mattresses.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.804
‐ And Larry Appleton‐‐
‐ Thanks, Balki. I feel better.

22:19.039 --> 22:20.774
You know, I have to admit

22:20.807 --> 22:23.009
you were pretty good
in that commercial.

22:23.043 --> 22:25.646
No. I mean it.
You were sensational.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.814
Even just the way you said,
"Here's the mail."

22:27.848 --> 22:29.750
Mail.

22:29.783 --> 22:30.751
That's what I said.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.653
No, you said "Mail."
It's "Mail."

22:34.420 --> 22:35.355
Mail.

22:37.658 --> 22:38.592
Better.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.929
What I'm trying to say is

22:42.963 --> 22:45.131
I'm proud of you.

22:45.165 --> 22:47.167
And I'll bet, you'll get a kick
out of seeing your picture

22:47.200 --> 22:49.770
on every bus in Chicago.

22:49.803 --> 22:53.373
Well, you've got a surprise
coming your way, cousin.

22:54.675 --> 22:55.876
What is it?

22:55.909 --> 22:57.077
Mmm.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.646
Balki, what's,
what's the surprise?

22:59.680 --> 23:01.447
No, no.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.415
Tell me.

23:21.201 --> 23:23.136
[instrumental music]

23:44.090 --> 23:45.959
[theme music]
