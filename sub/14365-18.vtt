WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.667
<b>2x18 - New Recruit</b>

00:02.850 --> 00:06.750
Removing Bumblebee
and replacing him with...

00:10.750 --> 00:13.083
The tap-dancing monkey
strikes again.

00:13.625 --> 00:17.625
Bumblebee sightings on the
world wide web are no laughing matter.

00:18.708 --> 00:20.625
7...

00:20.708 --> 00:25.625
8... 9...

00:25.708 --> 00:28.792
Why can't I
just drive from now on?

00:28.875 --> 00:32.875
Because your legs will
atrophy if you choose not to use them.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.750
1...

00:36.792 --> 00:39.000
2...

00:39.083 --> 00:41.458
3...

00:41.542 --> 00:43.958
Wait. What's that?

00:48.042 --> 00:50.708
A Cybertronian escape pod?

00:51.375 --> 00:54.125
Here in Earth's atmosphere?

00:57.042 --> 00:58.833
Autobot or Decepticon?

00:58.917 --> 01:02.542
Impossible to tell,
given the image resolution.

01:02.583 --> 01:05.750
In any event,
this merits investigation.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.417
Could be a trap,
and we're down one bot.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.625
- Should we reach out to Wheeljack?
- I can hear you!

01:12.708 --> 01:15.583
I don't care if Bulkhead
isn't combat-ready.

01:15.625 --> 01:20.958
After that revenge stunt he pulled
with Miko, Wheeljack can stay rogue.

01:21.042 --> 01:24.333
An Autobot may be in distress.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.325
Ratchet, bring your medical kit.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.083 --> 01:47.750
- It is of Decepticon origin.
- And the Con inside blew his way out.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.167
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

02:48.630 --> 02:51.130
All those Cons came out of one pod?

02:51.213 --> 02:54.497
The humans refer to the
phenomenon as a clown car.

03:28.438 --> 03:30.480
- Incoming!
- Down in front!

03:38.938 --> 03:41.355
Friendly?

03:47.897 --> 03:51.105
Fall back!

04:11.647 --> 04:14.980
Whoo!
Two hot for you, Cons?!

04:15.022 --> 04:17.147
Friend of yours?

04:18.730 --> 04:20.272
Never seen him before.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.180
Torching that Energon leak ...
pretty good plan, right?

04:24.322 --> 04:26.230
Except that it wasn't your plan.

04:26.313 --> 04:29.397
It was a random shot that
almost fried us to a crisp.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.730
- Worked out, didn't it?
- Thank you, fellow Autobot.

04:33.813 --> 04:37.605
Your... valor...
is to be commended.

04:37.688 --> 04:41.438
I... don't believe it.
Y-You're Optimus Prime!

04:41.522 --> 04:43.063
He's Optimus Prime!

04:43.147 --> 04:45.313
- We know.
- Yes, yes...

04:55.522 --> 04:58.397
It's an honor to be here...
especially with you.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.063
Now what? It's not like we can
just bring him back to base.

05:02.147 --> 05:06.313
Wouldn't be the first time
an ally turned out to be a plant.

05:12.697 --> 05:16.780
I see that you received your
training from Cybertron's elite guard.

05:16.863 --> 05:18.405
True enough ...

05:18.488 --> 05:21.363
though it wasn't more than
a boot camp by the time I joined.

05:21.447 --> 05:24.113
I never even got a proper
graduation ceremony.

05:24.155 --> 05:25.780
There was a war going on.

05:25.822 --> 05:29.405
Hey, all I ever wanted was to be
a soldier, serve the Autobot cause.

05:29.488 --> 05:32.738
But what I got was
security detail at Iacon.

05:32.822 --> 05:35.113
The Hall of Records of all places?

05:35.155 --> 05:39.155
Optimus, do you not find
this highly suspicious?

05:39.238 --> 05:43.655
Smokescreen, what was your
assignment inside the hall?

05:43.738 --> 05:47.947
Guarding Alpha Trion during what turned
out to be the final days of the war.

05:48.030 --> 05:51.822
- You served under the master archivist?
- Eh, I wasn't thrilled at first ...

05:51.905 --> 05:57.780
watching the back of an old bot
instead of kicking Con tailpipe.

05:59.780 --> 06:04.655
Sorry. But the big "A" turned out
to be a great teacher and a... true friend.

06:04.738 --> 06:07.155
I mean, he was the one
who petitioned Halogen

06:07.156 --> 06:09.572
and the High Council
to make you a Prime.

06:11.863 --> 06:15.697
Rafael... activate the ground bridge.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.863
That's it?
That's all you need to hear

06:17.947 --> 06:19.697
before inviting him to the party?

06:19.780 --> 06:23.947
If my former mentor shared
this information, it is because

06:23.988 --> 06:28.113
he considered Smokescreen
a trusted ally.

06:30.655 --> 06:32.988
We haven't had somebody
new here since Wheeljack.

06:33.072 --> 06:35.238
What's your story, Smoke?
Where'd you come from?

06:35.322 --> 06:38.155
How'd you get here?
How many blasters you packin'?

06:38.238 --> 06:42.322
So, these are the life-force
we're supposed to protect?

06:42.405 --> 06:45.863
- Are they all like this?
- Fortunately not...

06:45.947 --> 06:50.780
but I too share Miko's fascination
with how you came to arrive on Earth.

06:50.822 --> 06:53.113
In a Decepticon escape pod.

06:53.197 --> 06:57.280
Still got trust issues, huh?
Tough crowd.

06:57.322 --> 07:00.280
The main thrust of combat
operations was at least 20 clicks

07:00.363 --> 07:03.447
from the Hall of Records,
so things had been pretty quiet.

07:03.488 --> 07:07.280
But the situation went downhill fast.

07:07.363 --> 07:10.113
<i>The Cons launched a massive
surge that wiped out the last</i>

07:10.197 --> 07:12.822
<i>line of defenses surrounding Iacon.</i>

07:16.322 --> 07:23.613
<i>I was the only thing left to them back,
and, let me tell you, I was pumped.</i>

07:23.697 --> 07:28.947
<i>I mean, this was my chance to see real
action for the first time ... to prove myself.</i>

07:33.697 --> 07:37.488
<i>Until everything went black.</i>

07:38.530 --> 07:41.822
<i>Cons took me prisoner and
dumped me onto a transport ship.</i>

07:47.947 --> 07:53.655
<i>But I managed to give a guard the
slip and hopped in an escape pod.</i>

07:53.738 --> 07:59.155
<i>Apparently, it was a long-distance pod,
'cause it knocked me into stasis.</i>

07:59.238 --> 08:03.947
Next thing I knew,
I'm hitting solid ground ... hard.

08:04.030 --> 08:08.322
The Decepticon warship must have picked
up pod's beacon and guided it to Earth.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.488
Which would explain
Smokescreen's welcoming committee.

08:12.738 --> 08:16.488
Bet those Cons were disappointed
not to find one of their own inside.

08:16.530 --> 08:23.572
Smokescreen, do you know of
Alpha Ttrion's fate, after the fall of Iacon?

08:23.655 --> 08:29.488
I wish I did. But that was
the last I ever saw of him.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.613
That's it ...  my life story.

08:31.697 --> 08:36.863
Not exactly the glory I
envisioned for myself... until now.

08:36.947 --> 08:40.988
Being here with Optimus Prime ...
I knew I was destined for great things.

08:41.072 --> 08:44.988
I mean, now that you have help,
how hard could it be to end this war?

08:50.905 --> 08:54.280
Take a good look, Newbie.

09:00.197 --> 09:04.322
This is how hard.

09:04.363 --> 09:08.238
Smokescreen, I would suggest
that you take some time

09:08.322 --> 09:11.322
to become acclimated
to your new surroundings.

09:11.363 --> 09:14.988
A tour of the base would
be an excellent start.

09:15.072 --> 09:16.322
Sure thing!

09:20.405 --> 09:25.280
I mean... Jack here offers
a very informative tour.

09:29.822 --> 09:35.530
<i>This is what the humans call
"the information superhighway."</i>

09:35.613 --> 09:40.447
A trillion gigabytes of data ...
none of it's useful!

09:45.863 --> 09:49.488
Though some oddly engrossing.

09:53.863 --> 09:56.488
What is this?

09:56.530 --> 09:59.443
Ah...

09:59.478 --> 10:04.280
ignorant life-forms have no
idea what they've uncovered.

10:04.322 --> 10:07.280
Red Energon.

10:07.322 --> 10:14.238
If I can possess its power, not only
will I be stronger but also faster.

10:14.322 --> 10:18.322
Significantly faster.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.305
<i>Phase shifter... </i>

10:26.388 --> 10:28.930
Spark extractor...

10:28.972 --> 10:32.138
immobilizer...
this is where we store the

10:32.180 --> 10:33.972
Cybertronian relics we
found buried on Earth.

10:34.055 --> 10:36.763
And talk about a small universe
'cause most of them came from the ...

10:36.805 --> 10:41.888
The Iacon hall of records.
I remember these.

10:48.805 --> 10:53.013
Whoa.
What kind of relic is she?

10:53.097 --> 10:57.472
The kind you don't want to mess with.

11:02.305 --> 11:05.972
If you wanted to replace me,
you should have called Wheeljack.

11:06.055 --> 11:10.097
- I could have lived with that.
- No one is replacing you, Bulkhead.

11:10.138 --> 11:12.972
For one thing,
Smokescreen's too green.

11:13.097 --> 11:17.097
- Well, Bulk's as green as they get.
- What Arcee means is...

11:17.138 --> 11:19.930
Smokescreen still has
a great deal to learn.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.638
And once you got him
trained, then what, huh?

11:22.722 --> 11:24.972
He's in.
I'm a doorstop.

11:25.055 --> 11:29.305
Bulkhead, your place with us
is not in jeopardy, but there is

11:29.388 --> 11:33.347
no dispute that we have long
required additional firepower.

11:33.430 --> 11:36.596
It is essential that
our team learns to work

11:36.597 --> 11:39.763
with our new recruit,
not against him.

11:39.805 --> 11:43.930
Better hope the hotshot's
blasters are as big as his mouth.

11:43.972 --> 11:48.222
- How hard can it be?
- Hey, everyone. Check this out.

11:50.138 --> 11:57.222
But don't tell me it's another
Bumblebee sight... oh my.

11:57.305 --> 12:02.972
- Red Energon.
- Here... on Earth?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.472
What's Red Energon?

12:04.555 --> 12:07.930
An extremely rare and
volatile form of Energellum.

12:07.972 --> 12:11.472
Refined into fuel, it provides
the power of hyperspeed.

12:11.555 --> 12:16.013
We must have Agent Fowler clear
the dig site of all human presence

12:16.014 --> 12:20.472
in the event we are not the only
ones who have discovered its location.

12:20.555 --> 12:24.555
Now you're talking.
Let's scramble up some Cons' circuits.

12:24.638 --> 12:28.263
Given your limited field
experience, I believe further

12:28.305 --> 12:31.513
training is required
before you are battle-ready.

12:31.597 --> 12:33.972
Optimus, with all due respect ...

12:34.055 --> 12:38.638
Furthermore, we Autobots live on
this planet as robots in disguise.

12:38.722 --> 12:42.763
You will need to obtain
an Earth-based vehicle mode.

12:42.805 --> 12:47.347
In order to maintain a low profile...
if that's possible for you.

12:47.430 --> 12:51.013
If you're talking wheels,
bring 'em on!

12:52.680 --> 12:55.972
The Red Energon is mine, humans!

12:56.055 --> 13:00.763
For you are powerless in the
face of the mighty star...

13:00.805 --> 13:03.138
What?

13:04.472 --> 13:07.513
<i>Where is it?</i>

13:09.722 --> 13:12.038
<i>Nope.</i>

13:14.680 --> 13:16.513
How about that one?

13:16.597 --> 13:19.722
Eh, it's more Ratchet's speed,
don't you think?

13:20.805 --> 13:25.430
- Cement truck?
- Yeah, if I were a Constructicon.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.138
Seriously, this is the best
your planet has to offer?

13:29.180 --> 13:37.388
- No, but this is Jasper.
- I feel for you.

13:56.513 --> 13:59.722
Fowler couldn't have the
crane operator lower the thing?

13:59.805 --> 14:02.513
The humans must have been
preparing to transfer the meteor

14:02.597 --> 14:07.013
to a cargo ship when they
received his evacuation order.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.805
<i>Run along home, Autobots.</i>

14:09.888 --> 14:14.763
That Red Energon has
my name all over it.

14:29.472 --> 14:34.763
And I am more
than willing to fight for it.

14:42.425 --> 14:46.967
Secure the Red Energon and have
Ratchet bridge it back to base.

15:02.258 --> 15:08.175
Don't tell me you've already
forgotten our last encounter, Prime.

15:08.258 --> 15:11.925
Keep moving, B.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.758
Optimus, is something wrong?

15:18.800 --> 15:22.946
<i>Starscream has come for the Red Energon,</i>

15:22.947 --> 15:27.092
<i>and I fear he will not
be deterred in his quest.</i>

15:27.133 --> 15:27.967
Starscream?

15:28.050 --> 15:31.758
I heard stories about that
stiletto-heeled creep back on Cybertron.

15:31.842 --> 15:32.758
Send me in, Doc.

15:32.842 --> 15:35.675
When Optimus requires
backup, he will ask for it.

15:35.758 --> 15:38.342
Aw, come on.
I got my V-mode and everything.

15:38.425 --> 15:41.008
- I'm souped up and ready to roll.
- Eh! Eh! Eh!

15:41.092 --> 15:46.425
What part of "further training"
did you not understand?

15:54.175 --> 15:58.342
The higher you climb,
the harder you fall.

16:04.425 --> 16:08.592
Autobots ...
such slow learners.

16:08.675 --> 16:10.425
Optimus, what is your status?

16:10.508 --> 16:13.925
Ratchet, they need me.
I can do this.

16:13.967 --> 16:17.342
Arcee? Bumblebee?

16:17.425 --> 16:21.717
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard, and I'm ignoring you.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.425
This may be your opportunity
after all, Smokescre...

16:28.717 --> 16:31.592
Where is Smokescreen?

16:35.467 --> 16:39.633
- That's the one.
- You, there!

16:39.717 --> 16:43.425
What in the name of the Allspark
do you think you're doing?

17:00.342 --> 17:03.467
Time to unload some more deadweight.

17:21.050 --> 17:21.967
No!

17:41.383 --> 17:44.300
Watch your step, Autobots!

18:07.042 --> 18:09.958
Apparently, no one defined
"low profile" for him.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.292
So, the Autobots have a new recruit.

18:22.375 --> 18:26.625
And you must be Starscream.
I thought you'd be taller.

18:28.125 --> 18:32.958
- This will not end well.
- Smokescreen, stand down.

18:33.042 --> 18:36.000
You are no match for
Starscream's Apex armor.

18:36.083 --> 18:39.167
Any last words, Smokescreen?

18:39.250 --> 18:43.542
Just four ...
kiss your armor goodbye.

18:58.667 --> 19:04.458
- A Phase shifter?
- Now, that was a plan!

19:10.167 --> 19:16.625
You aren't the only one sporting
a fancy wrist-mounted device.

19:16.667 --> 19:18.542
Think fast!

19:26.667 --> 19:28.167
No!

19:58.083 --> 20:01.542
Told you I just needed
to borrow it for a while.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.958
Doc here thought I was
trying to steal your relics.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.125
Only until you explained your
plan, which I then sanctioned.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.667
It's called protocol.

20:10.708 --> 20:14.000
Ratchet is correct.
Standard procedure must be

20:14.083 --> 20:18.292
observed by every member of this team.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.667
However...

20:20.708 --> 20:24.167
I believe we must also
commend Smokescreen.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.792
You have proven to be a quick study

20:27.827 --> 20:31.292
by choosing to place
strategy above bravado.

20:31.333 --> 20:34.333
There is gonna be no
living with him now.

20:34.375 --> 20:37.958
While this may lack
the pageantry of a proper elite

20:38.000 --> 20:42.125
guard ceremony, I wish to
welcome you to team Prime.

20:55.708 --> 21:00.833
The Newbie did all right.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.750
Don't worry, Bulk.
He's got nothing on you.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.458
Seriously, once we get that
leg of yours back in shape,

21:12.500 --> 21:17.320
old Smokey's gonna learn real quick
who the top wrecking ball is run here.

21:22.433 --> 21:24.292
