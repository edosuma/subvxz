01:14.732 --> 01:16.133
Good year.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.260
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:58.475 --> 02:00.157
Chuck, are you feeling okay?

02:00.158 --> 02:02.994
Fine. Good. Great... I'm great.

02:03.531 --> 02:04.589
Great. Why do you ask?

02:04.590 --> 02:06.024
You seem a little nervous.

02:06.025 --> 02:07.491
Me, nervous. No, I'm not...

02:07.836 --> 02:09.894
feel nervous... at all.
I don't think, no.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.767
Just, I-you know,
just this is a very,

02:11.768 --> 02:13.369
it's an incredibly
romantic restaurant.

02:13.765 --> 02:14.947
You know, I'm just
taking it all in.

02:14.948 --> 02:16.249
Chuck, you can talk to me.

02:16.882 --> 02:18.691
Is this about your mom?
No.

02:18.692 --> 02:20.360
Um, I've realized something.

02:20.625 --> 02:23.527
You know, a-after all the stuff
with my mom and Volkoff, and...

02:24.994 --> 02:28.051
I-I realized that,
you know, I-I...

02:28.052 --> 02:29.799
haven't really
been thinking about us,

02:29.800 --> 02:31.133
you and me.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.292
I've been so wrapped up
in all the things

02:33.293 --> 02:34.626
that I couldn't control

02:34.667 --> 02:36.289
that I forgot to focus

02:36.290 --> 02:38.524
on the things that... I could.

02:41.718 --> 02:43.252
Like tonight.

02:43.652 --> 02:45.152
What about tonight?

02:46.898 --> 02:48.956
I know I've kind of been
dragging my feet on this,

02:48.957 --> 02:50.591
but I've just been waiting
for the right moment

02:50.765 --> 02:52.263
to-to talk about,
you know,

02:52.264 --> 02:54.265
what it's going to be like
for us and our future.

02:54.385 --> 02:55.944
Chuck, don't even
worry about it.

02:55.945 --> 02:57.812
I know that you've
got so much going on.

02:57.941 --> 03:00.075
You've had so much happen
to you in the last few months.

03:01.437 --> 03:02.872
And besides,
I've got such a

03:02.873 --> 03:04.340
bad history with proposals.

03:06.679 --> 03:08.114
No! No, not me.

03:08.115 --> 03:09.916
My, my parents had
a nightmare proposal.

03:10.672 --> 03:12.421
I'm-I'm sure it can't
have been that bad.

03:12.422 --> 03:14.056
No, it was... bad.

03:15.102 --> 03:17.223
My mother's family
had a restaurant.

03:17.224 --> 03:18.690
It was similar to this,

03:18.721 --> 03:19.922
and they loved
it, so my dad

03:20.031 --> 03:21.265
wanted to propose
there, and...

03:22.215 --> 03:23.961
God! he had the champagne

03:23.962 --> 03:25.462
and the flowers and

03:25.463 --> 03:27.597
the band, and the balloons, and,

03:28.205 --> 03:29.642
I mean, it was chaotic.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.015
It was so over the top.

03:31.016 --> 03:32.783
And in all the confusion,

03:33.259 --> 03:34.425
somebody knocked
over a candle,

03:34.698 --> 03:35.820
and it lit the
rug on fire.

03:35.821 --> 03:37.255
Luckily my mother and her family

03:38.314 --> 03:39.948
got out with only minor burns.

03:40.314 --> 03:42.548
Minor-minor burns?
You-you don't say.
Yeah.

03:42.808 --> 03:45.409
So, please,
take your time, Chuck.

03:46.241 --> 03:48.074
No rush.

03:51.045 --> 03:52.779
Um, that's an awful story.

03:53.603 --> 03:55.737
I mean, that's-that's
really, really awful.

03:56.662 --> 03:58.907
But I'm sure they had
a great laugh about it

03:58.908 --> 03:59.967
on their wedding day, right?

03:59.968 --> 04:02.002
No. They took it as a sign,

04:02.277 --> 04:04.445
and they postponed the wedding.

04:04.772 --> 04:05.584
My dad always said

04:05.585 --> 04:06.581
it was the beginning of

04:06.582 --> 04:07.849
the end of their
relationship.

04:09.452 --> 04:11.449
What was that noise?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.251
Uh, noise? What
noise? Oh, my jaw.

04:13.571 --> 04:14.671
I have a
cracking jaw.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.440
Can you hear that?
Yeah. It's just...

04:16.442 --> 04:17.942
I thought I told you about
that... I mean you're not...

04:18.314 --> 04:19.581
nev... when we were
kissing or whatever?

04:19.623 --> 04:21.457
If you'd excuse me, actually,
I'm just going to...

04:21.870 --> 04:23.570
be right back.

04:26.551 --> 04:27.049
Morgan,

04:27.050 --> 04:28.109
Morgan, Morgan.
Abort!

04:28.110 --> 04:29.170
Damn it! I knew it.
Not enough balloons!

04:29.171 --> 04:31.105
Bl-bl-bl... you-you bought
the whole store. No!

04:31.232 --> 04:32.791
No balloons, no nothing.
The proposal is off.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.026
We can't have it in an
Italian restaurant!

04:34.413 --> 04:35.348
Are you, wait,
are you kidding me?

04:35.349 --> 04:36.582
What is she on,
like a no carb thing?

04:36.847 --> 04:38.282
No. We can't have it
in any restaurant, okay?

04:38.283 --> 04:40.551
That's exactly how her parents'
nightmare proposal went!

04:40.841 --> 04:42.275
We gotta shut it down.
We gotta shut it down now!

04:42.276 --> 04:43.509
I can't shut it down, dude.

04:44.524 --> 04:45.833
What? Why? Wha-What
are you talking about?

04:45.834 --> 04:48.636
The champagne, the string
quartet, the caballeros.

04:48.828 --> 04:49.962
The caballos?
Whatever, man.

04:50.389 --> 04:51.761
It-it's all in motion!

04:51.762 --> 04:53.263
We are in too deep here!

04:58.998 --> 04:59.623
Excuse me. Hey.

04:59.624 --> 05:01.245
Hi. Champagne. Let's go
ahead and cancel that.

05:01.246 --> 05:02.580
Sir, the bottle's already open.

05:02.869 --> 05:03.835
Um, who's going to drink it?

05:04.243 --> 05:05.362
I...

05:05.363 --> 05:06.861
This lovely couple.
Please, my treat.

05:06.862 --> 05:09.130
Oh no, we
don't indulge.
Says who?

05:10.417 --> 05:11.451
What?

05:12.602 --> 05:15.137
Get away. Go!

05:18.280 --> 05:19.153
Beckman called.

05:19.154 --> 05:20.154
We've got a mission.

05:21.215 --> 05:22.616
Gosh, that's really a bummer.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.146
I wanted to...

05:24.147 --> 05:25.315
Well, duty's
duty, right?

05:26.641 --> 05:29.208
Shoo! Hi-Yo Silver!
Take a hike.

05:29.264 --> 05:32.199
Let's take the side exit.
It's really scenic.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.188
The balloons!

05:34.960 --> 05:37.044
www.addic7ed.com

06:09.202 --> 06:12.663
www.addic7ed.com

06:14.121 --> 06:15.822
Agent
Rosenbaum, one of our finest,

06:16.556 --> 06:18.800
was gunned down earlier today
while transporting

06:18.801 --> 06:20.001
a nano-chip containing

06:20.050 --> 06:22.085
the secret locations
and blueprints

06:22.359 --> 06:24.560
of our CIA Black Sites
in Europe.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.360
This is the chip.

06:27.164 --> 06:29.034
The nano-chip can be
injected into an agent

06:29.035 --> 06:31.369
if he's in trouble, and then
extracted back at Langley.

06:31.655 --> 06:33.455
None of that sounds
very pleasant.

06:33.779 --> 06:34.913
Sorry, General.

06:35.150 --> 06:37.211
Some moron was clogging up
Ventura Boulevard

06:37.212 --> 06:38.332
with a horse and carriage.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.800
At ease, Colonel.

06:39.831 --> 06:41.198
Agent Rosenbaum's body

06:41.204 --> 06:42.304
was returned to us, yet

06:42.391 --> 06:43.791
our tests show no trace

06:43.889 --> 06:45.257
of the nano-chip's presence.

06:45.510 --> 06:47.070
We believe the chip
is somewhere within

06:47.071 --> 06:49.339
this château.

06:49.815 --> 06:51.810
Don't tell me this
mission's in France.

06:51.811 --> 06:52.944
Pierre Melville,

06:52.997 --> 06:55.332
a French radical turned
terrorist, is also

06:55.431 --> 06:57.031
searching for the nano-chip.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.736
Um... one of
Volkoff's men?
Not every criminal

06:59.737 --> 07:01.705
works for Alexei Volkoff, Chuck.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.864
Agents Walker, Bartowski...

07:03.980 --> 07:05.546
you will attend
the wine tasting gala

07:05.789 --> 07:07.348
at the château tomorrow.

07:07.349 --> 07:08.596
Colonel, you will be posing as

07:08.597 --> 07:10.798
Agent Bartowski's
personal manservant.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.173
Hey, um,

07:20.206 --> 07:21.706
I'm sorry about dinner.

07:21.826 --> 07:22.948
No, it's...

07:22.949 --> 07:24.950
it's just... just
dinner, you know?

07:26.754 --> 07:28.003
I-I should, uh, go

07:28.004 --> 07:29.939
check in with
Morgan. Yeah.

07:38.674 --> 07:39.841
General, I know why Chuck

07:40.110 --> 07:41.294
was asking about Volkoff.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.828
He's concerned
for his family and friends.

07:43.105 --> 07:45.640
And I want to make something
absolutely clear:

07:45.975 --> 07:47.410
I will do anything in my power

07:47.411 --> 07:48.611
to help bring
back Chuck's mother

07:48.848 --> 07:50.848
and to eliminate Volkoff
and his organization.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.649
I understand your commitment,
Agent Walker,

07:53.650 --> 07:54.850
and I commend it,

07:55.647 --> 07:56.957
but we must wait

07:56.958 --> 07:58.959
for the right opportunity.

08:01.764 --> 08:02.884
<i>Relax, it was just dinner.</i>

08:02.885 --> 08:03.818
Morgan, it's hard enough asking

08:04.008 --> 08:05.509
a super-spy to marry you.

08:05.758 --> 08:07.424
But now I have to propose
to a super-spy

08:07.440 --> 08:08.740
with major proposal issues.

08:09.375 --> 08:10.249
Hey, listen, buddy.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.621
We will bounce
back. Now, I...

08:11.622 --> 08:13.390
No, no, no. No, no, no. We're
not going to bounce back, okay?

08:13.494 --> 08:15.241
Listen, Morgan. What happened
with Sarah's parents

08:15.242 --> 08:17.143
became a symbol for everything
she's gone through in life.

08:17.488 --> 08:19.483
Now, more than ever,
I need the perfect proposal.

08:19.484 --> 08:20.951
And, of course,
we have a new mission.

08:21.046 --> 08:21.918
Precisely, amigo.

08:21.919 --> 08:22.980
You are going
to a château

08:22.981 --> 08:23.981
in the French
countryside.

08:24.039 --> 08:25.039
There's going to
be moats and wine

08:25.474 --> 08:26.408
and the woman
of your dreams.

08:26.411 --> 08:27.300
What are you proposing?

08:27.301 --> 08:28.368
What am I... ?

08:28.486 --> 08:29.652
Come here.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.109
Sub-mission.

08:31.483 --> 08:32.730
Okay? Your assignment?

08:32.731 --> 08:34.030
To ask Sarah Walker to marry you

08:34.039 --> 08:35.107
in the Loire Valley.

08:35.351 --> 08:36.660
It is known as the Garden

08:36.662 --> 08:37.895
of France. Did you
know that? Yeah.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.399
And the best part of
this whole crazy idea

08:39.534 --> 08:40.902
is that the CIA
is footing the bill!

08:40.903 --> 08:41.936
Morgan, I need to think about

08:42.090 --> 08:43.591
my team and the objective,

08:44.087 --> 08:46.146
not to mention the fact that I'm
a horrible multitasker. So, no;

08:46.147 --> 08:47.181
no sub-mission.

08:47.270 --> 08:48.328
All right. I respect that.

08:48.329 --> 08:49.463
And I respectfully disagree.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.075
Okay, we have
exhausted all of our

08:51.076 --> 08:52.710
Burbank proposal options,
and I think what we need

08:52.885 --> 08:54.985
is a marital miracle here,
and I think this is it.

08:55.194 --> 08:57.662
Why is everyone so obsessed
with marriage?!

09:00.747 --> 09:02.681
I don't want to talk about it!

09:04.244 --> 09:05.617
You should probably
take care of that.

09:05.618 --> 09:07.519
Me? No, no. That's why
I have my fixer.

09:07.862 --> 09:10.296
Uh, Michael!
Talk to me, Patel.

09:10.421 --> 09:12.853
You seem more angry
and unhappy

09:12.854 --> 09:14.689
than usual, which
is tough because

09:14.788 --> 09:16.288
you're a curmudgeonly
little guy.

09:16.535 --> 09:18.533
I just want to be free,
Big Michael.

09:18.534 --> 09:21.436
But my control-freak parents...

09:22.401 --> 09:23.900
have arranged a marriage

09:23.901 --> 09:27.642
for me.
Mm. First generation
woes. Tough stuff.

09:27.643 --> 09:29.343
It's like they're stuck
in the ways of the old country--

09:29.453 --> 09:30.887
with their, with their
dated traditions

09:30.888 --> 09:32.571
and their obsolete
dietary restrictions.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.819
And I keep telling them...

09:33.820 --> 09:35.955
I live in the United States
of America now.

09:36.503 --> 09:38.772
I'm not in Canada anymore.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.746
Y-You mean India, right?

09:41.747 --> 09:42.846
What? No.

09:43.555 --> 09:44.802
No, I'm from Saskatchewan.

09:44.803 --> 09:46.103
The Hinjews of Saskatchewan.

09:46.487 --> 09:47.548
Some believe that we're...

09:47.549 --> 09:49.084
a cult of sorts.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.979
I see.
Anyway, they
don't get it.

09:50.980 --> 09:52.228
You know, I've embraced America

09:52.229 --> 09:53.753
and its great traditions,

09:53.754 --> 09:55.320
like online dating,

09:55.439 --> 09:58.307
which, FYI, I am killing it.

09:58.435 --> 10:00.335
I've been there.
I've had

10:00.619 --> 10:02.420
three dates
already... today.

10:03.239 --> 10:03.986
During work?

10:03.987 --> 10:05.353
They come to me, man.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.428
Not great, uh, individually,

10:07.484 --> 10:08.617
but solid fours.

10:08.731 --> 10:10.599
Three fours?
That's twelve.

10:11.665 --> 10:12.724
Exactly, man.

10:12.725 --> 10:14.558
No Saskatchewan bride
could ever top that.

10:14.908 --> 10:16.175
And the worst part is,

10:16.719 --> 10:20.022
my parents are sending her here.

10:20.711 --> 10:22.212
What the hell am I going to do?

10:22.834 --> 10:23.955
How about the truth,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.577
son? "The truth

10:25.578 --> 10:26.845
shall set you free."

10:29.009 --> 10:30.257
Brilliant.

10:30.258 --> 10:31.631
But let her down easy;

10:31.632 --> 10:33.266
the truth can be
harsh. Let's...

10:33.380 --> 10:34.914
let's be kind about this.

10:35.251 --> 10:36.418
Thanks, bud.

10:38.432 --> 10:39.371
The nano-chip emits

10:39.372 --> 10:40.372
an encrypted signal that only

10:40.432 --> 10:41.925
our CIA trackers can detect.

10:41.926 --> 10:43.394
We need to get close enough

10:43.799 --> 10:45.099
to pick up the signal,

10:45.296 --> 10:46.495
recover the nano-chip before

10:46.546 --> 10:47.794
Pierre and his men do.

10:47.795 --> 10:50.597
Check.
Let's go.
Yep.

10:54.408 --> 10:55.842
Where you going? Where you
going? Where you going?

10:55.843 --> 10:56.877
Time for the real mission:

10:56.966 --> 10:57.902
the sub-mission.

10:57.903 --> 10:59.136
No. No, Morg...
No, Morgan.

10:59.336 --> 11:00.370
We've talked about this.

11:00.771 --> 11:01.705
Listen to me.

11:01.707 --> 11:03.441
Everything is in place for a...

11:04.142 --> 11:05.326
perfect proposal.

11:05.327 --> 11:06.263
Okay. I've pinpointed

11:06.264 --> 11:07.575
potential proposal locations...

11:07.576 --> 11:09.376
here: balcony overlooking
the countryside,

11:10.945 --> 11:12.940
rose garden,
quaint stone bridge.

11:12.941 --> 11:14.810
Wh-when you're searching
for this nano-whatever,

11:14.811 --> 11:16.645
you can choose whichever
location you like.

11:16.748 --> 11:18.748
I don't, I don't care,
but watch Sarah, okay?

11:18.805 --> 11:19.838
She'll show you to the spot.

11:20.116 --> 11:21.549
And remember something:

11:21.801 --> 11:23.800
you can do this.
Morgan,

11:23.801 --> 11:25.294
I've already told you.
No sub-mission.

11:25.295 --> 11:26.667
Good, good, good.
Well, at least you keep

11:26.668 --> 11:27.801
an open mind
about it, so...

11:45.701 --> 11:48.136
No sign of Pierre yet.

11:48.260 --> 11:50.067
Keep your eyes open.

11:50.068 --> 11:52.535
Right. I'm on it.

11:59.304 --> 12:00.927
Is this place
amazing, or what?

12:00.928 --> 12:02.461
It-it-it feels so...

12:02.862 --> 12:03.796
Romantic.

12:03.797 --> 12:05.297
Yeah.
I know.

12:18.648 --> 12:19.770
Chuck.
Morgan.

12:19.771 --> 12:20.395
You were so right.

12:20.396 --> 12:21.143
This place is magical.

12:21.144 --> 12:22.844
I knew it. I knew it.
All right, listen.

12:22.891 --> 12:24.014
You can do this. Which is why

12:24.015 --> 12:25.262
I put the ring
in the right pocket,

12:25.263 --> 12:26.597
earpiece in the left pocket,

12:26.821 --> 12:28.488
and then mints
in both pockets, all right?

12:28.819 --> 12:29.504
And also, listen,

12:29.505 --> 12:30.806
I will be here at base,

12:30.816 --> 12:31.983
quarterbacking the
whole way, all right?

12:32.253 --> 12:33.253
So you are good to go, bro.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.809
This is crazy.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.276
But you're still
going to do it, right?

12:40.488 --> 12:41.423
Look sharp, Bartowski.

12:41.424 --> 12:42.891
This nano-chip isn't
going to find itself.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.669
I want to be out of this
French hellhole, and back

12:44.670 --> 12:46.704
stateside for lunch tomorrow.

12:48.539 --> 12:50.139
Look at these
fancy Frogs.

12:51.286 --> 12:52.405
Forget it, buddy.

12:52.406 --> 12:53.340
I'm not going to be able to do

12:53.407 --> 12:54.469
anything with Casey being...

12:54.470 --> 12:55.775
well, Casey.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.843
Chuck, <i>bubelah,</i> come on!

12:58.086 --> 12:59.553
Casey is your manservant.

12:59.895 --> 13:02.498
Let him "manserve" you.

13:05.199 --> 13:07.200
You, there. Jonathan!

13:09.569 --> 13:13.037
Have you unpacked
the lady's luggage yet?

13:13.497 --> 13:15.369
Call me Jonathan again,
I'll break your leg.

13:15.370 --> 13:16.304
Cover...

13:16.305 --> 13:18.306
Remember your cover...

13:18.740 --> 13:20.423
You are supposed to be
searching underground

13:20.424 --> 13:21.358
for the
nano-chip pulser;

13:21.610 --> 13:22.610
and I search
above ground

13:22.858 --> 13:24.192
for the nano-chip,
with all the wine

13:24.855 --> 13:25.922
and cheese.

13:29.223 --> 13:30.990
Oh, one more thing, Jon-Jon.

13:31.594 --> 13:34.589
Could you put my slippers
out for tonight?

13:34.590 --> 13:36.275
That'd be very helpful.
Thanks so much.

13:36.276 --> 13:37.276
Off you go. Chop-chop.

13:38.209 --> 13:39.943
Yeah.

13:44.264 --> 13:45.446
What was it we were do...

13:45.447 --> 13:47.013
Oh, yes, this is where we were.

13:51.874 --> 13:52.621
We should probably get looking

13:52.622 --> 13:53.555
for the nano-chip, huh?

13:53.685 --> 13:54.885
Yes. Yes, we should.

13:56.867 --> 13:57.676
We're not getting a signal here,

13:57.677 --> 13:58.810
but we can search upstairs.

13:59.487 --> 14:01.488
Shall we?

14:06.662 --> 14:07.862
Still no signal.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.664
Where is this thing?

14:11.031 --> 14:12.064
Wow!

14:13.215 --> 14:14.961
Chuck, look at where we are.

14:14.962 --> 14:16.795
It-it's beautiful.

14:20.018 --> 14:20.766
We're going to have

14:20.767 --> 14:22.576
a sub-mission
location confirmation.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.145
Western facing balcony. I'm in.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.569
Yes! I knew you could handle

14:25.570 --> 14:26.503
a mission with a sub-mission.

14:27.379 --> 14:29.180
All right. Let's go.

14:39.798 --> 14:40.732
Bartowski.

14:40.859 --> 14:41.606
Good call in

14:41.607 --> 14:42.481
sending me down to the cellar.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.683
I got a signal on the nano-chip.

14:51.479 --> 14:52.712
Wait. Someone's here.

14:54.286 --> 14:55.487
Hold up. Hold up.

14:55.722 --> 14:57.322
Is everything okay, Casey?

14:57.469 --> 14:59.027
Pierre's down here.

14:59.028 --> 14:59.779
Looks like he's using

14:59.780 --> 15:00.947
the party as a cover, as well.

15:02.712 --> 15:04.519
Sir.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.588
I found this
beneath the racks.

15:07.328 --> 15:08.695
Blood.

15:14.254 --> 15:15.454
Excellent year.

15:15.753 --> 15:18.422
It's an '86
Château LeFranc.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.182
He must have injected it

15:20.183 --> 15:21.306
into one of these bottles.

15:21.307 --> 15:23.075
Find me
every bottle
of that vintage.

15:23.303 --> 15:24.737
The nano-chip is in a bottle of

15:24.738 --> 15:25.972
'86 Château LeFranc.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.534
The signal's getting weaker.

15:34.535 --> 15:35.467
The bottle's on the move.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.261
Okay, Casey. We're on our way.

15:42.336 --> 15:43.956
Someone is here.

15:43.957 --> 15:46.893
No one leaves
this room alive.

15:57.688 --> 15:58.313
You told Casey

15:58.314 --> 15:59.562
to go to the cellar, right?

15:59.563 --> 16:00.809
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

16:00.810 --> 16:01.744
W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

16:02.431 --> 16:03.565
I'm picking up a signal.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.400
The bottle's outside.

16:07.612 --> 16:08.608
Okay. You get the wine:

16:08.609 --> 16:09.876
I'll get Casey.

16:11.544 --> 16:12.477
How's it going buddy?

16:12.601 --> 16:14.569
What is the sub-mission status?

16:14.726 --> 16:16.035
On hold, buddy. I'm busy chasing

16:16.036 --> 16:18.137
a priceless '86 Château LeFranc.

16:30.885 --> 16:32.584
Morgan, Morgan. Flag on
the play. I've lost it.

16:32.696 --> 16:34.297
I've lost the bottle.
Right.

16:37.627 --> 16:39.065
Chuck. The '86 Château

16:39.066 --> 16:40.745
LeFranc is a peppery Pinot

16:40.746 --> 16:41.812
with a stable on the label,

16:42.181 --> 16:44.115
and a stork on the cork.
Copy that.

16:44.614 --> 16:45.922
Um, um, wh-wh-wh,

16:45.923 --> 16:47.547
it was, it was a
peppery Pinot, right?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.948
A peppery Pinot
with a cork on the stork

16:49.044 --> 16:50.077
and a label on the stable.

16:50.107 --> 16:51.102
No, it's a...

16:51.103 --> 16:52.770
a stable on the label
and a cork on the stork.

16:53.225 --> 16:54.158
Dude, it's... No, it's not.

16:54.474 --> 16:55.574
What did you just say?

17:08.142 --> 17:08.886
Casey,

17:08.887 --> 17:10.010
I'm outside the cellar door.

17:10.011 --> 17:11.196
This place is crawling

17:11.198 --> 17:12.732
with French bad guys.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.535
Ugh! It's so bright.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.768
Oh... God, I'm...

17:43.769 --> 17:44.955
Oh, God.

17:44.956 --> 17:47.558
I'm so sorry. I've, um...

17:47.640 --> 17:49.407
I'm... I'm just
a little bit lost.

17:49.450 --> 17:50.950
I've had just a bit too much...

17:51.384 --> 17:52.129
wine.

17:52.130 --> 17:53.504
I'm so embarrassed.
I just...

17:53.505 --> 17:55.106
I-I broke my heel, and my...

17:55.876 --> 17:57.309
my ankle, it just...

17:57.310 --> 17:58.243
kind of really hurts

17:58.621 --> 18:00.354
right now. Mm.

18:10.602 --> 18:12.435
Can't stand this country.

18:24.129 --> 18:26.429
Stable on the label
and a stork on the cork.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.738
Ho.

18:28.624 --> 18:29.590
Gotcha.

18:36.673 --> 18:38.541
It's a fine vintage, isn't it?

18:38.794 --> 18:39.666
It's... peppery.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.103
Well-structured
for aging.

18:41.104 --> 18:42.725
Lots of tannins.
Chuck.

18:42.726 --> 18:44.227
Casey's okay.
Do you have the bottle?

18:44.473 --> 18:46.095
Uh... I'm in a wine tasting,
right now.

18:46.096 --> 18:47.696
The nano-chip has been poured
into somebody's glass.

18:48.028 --> 18:49.895
Okay, just find the
right glass. I'm on my way up.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.134
Fine. Yes. Got it. I'm all,

18:51.399 --> 18:52.699
I'm all over it.
I'll meet you on the balcony.

18:53.583 --> 18:54.783
Looks like Pierre's MIA.

18:56.765 --> 18:58.599
Come on.

19:07.811 --> 19:09.278
Sir! Hi. Sir, hi.

19:09.371 --> 19:10.617
Excuse me. Um...

19:10.618 --> 19:11.851
I'm terribly sorry,
but I believe

19:11.991 --> 19:13.458
there's been
a mix-up downstairs,

19:13.488 --> 19:14.360
and you've received

19:14.361 --> 19:15.494
the wrong glass of wine.

19:15.549 --> 19:17.417
That's actually
the Burgundy from Bordeaux

19:17.733 --> 19:18.733
with the coil on the foil,

19:18.980 --> 19:20.781
and the fork on the cork.
What?

19:20.792 --> 19:21.848
That does not make sense.

19:21.849 --> 19:22.849
They are both regions.

19:23.225 --> 19:24.325
This...

19:24.346 --> 19:26.154
is the peppery Pinot

19:26.155 --> 19:27.341
with the stable on the label

19:27.342 --> 19:28.774
and the stork on the cork.

19:29.712 --> 19:30.835
In fact...

19:30.836 --> 19:33.070
I have been
waiting to taste

19:33.083 --> 19:34.884
this exact bottle

19:34.956 --> 19:37.591
for two decades.

19:41.568 --> 19:42.442
I didn't want to have
to tell you this,

19:42.443 --> 19:44.251
but there is something in...

19:44.252 --> 19:45.652
your wine... there.

19:46.126 --> 19:46.996
Yes...

19:46.997 --> 19:49.399
There is something in the wine.

19:49.994 --> 19:53.174
200 years of French history!

19:53.175 --> 19:56.045
The blood and sweat
of my ancestors!

19:56.046 --> 19:58.815
The pride of lords
and peasants alike!

19:58.916 --> 20:00.484
You, sir...

20:00.914 --> 20:02.160
wouldn't know the difference

20:02.161 --> 20:03.128
between this...

20:03.596 --> 20:04.829
and a glass of

20:05.094 --> 20:07.029
Two-Buck Chuck.
First of all,

20:07.030 --> 20:08.589
I happen to like Two-Buck Chuck.

20:08.590 --> 20:09.957
Great bang for your buck.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.085
Second of all,

20:11.086 --> 20:12.208
you are danger close to

20:12.209 --> 20:13.742
becoming a walking
cliché, sir.
Good-bye.

20:15.436 --> 20:16.569
My Pinot!

20:21.613 --> 20:22.237
Stop!

20:22.238 --> 20:23.672
Give me the
glass of wine.

20:33.407 --> 20:34.407
You mean this glass of wine?

21:05.866 --> 21:07.549
What's happening?
Talk to me, goose.

21:07.550 --> 21:09.184
Mission accomplished.
I've got the nano-chip.

21:09.922 --> 21:10.732
Sub-mission on?

21:10.733 --> 21:12.100
Sub-mission is <i>so</i> on.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.727
Yes. Fantastic.

21:13.728 --> 21:15.224
FYI, sunset is in...

21:15.225 --> 21:16.158
three minutes, okay?

21:17.719 --> 21:18.593
And everyone looks good

21:18.594 --> 21:19.994
at golden hour-- everyone.

21:25.044 --> 21:25.915
Where's Casey?

21:25.916 --> 21:26.983
Getting the car.
Is that the nano-chip?

21:27.290 --> 21:29.025
One peppery Pinot...

21:29.036 --> 21:31.771
with a hint of nano-chip
in the finish.

21:32.903 --> 21:34.937
Good work, Chuck.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.960
Oh, look at that.

21:39.144 --> 21:41.345
Just in time
for sunset.

21:46.757 --> 21:49.191
It's amazing,
isn't it?

21:49.564 --> 21:52.066
It's perfect.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.556
Good.

21:56.866 --> 21:57.491
There's, uh...

21:57.492 --> 21:59.526
There's something
I've wanted to...

22:03.283 --> 22:04.842
Chuck, Sarah, move it!

22:04.843 --> 22:05.909
That's our ride.
Let's go.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.042
Huh.

22:15.013 --> 22:16.646
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

22:29.372 --> 22:30.123
General Beckman.

22:30.124 --> 22:32.559
I have decided to debrief
the team in person.

22:34.175 --> 22:35.843
The CIA has analyzed
the nano-chip.

22:36.608 --> 22:38.231
The secret locations
and blueprints

22:38.232 --> 22:41.867
of our European Black
Sites are now safe.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.628
But your mission isn't over.

22:44.221 --> 22:45.989
You're going back to France.

22:46.154 --> 22:47.090
Not again.

22:47.091 --> 22:48.725
Not you, Colonel.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.408
A couple in love are more
believable turncoats.

22:51.584 --> 22:53.206
Agents Walker,
Bartowski,

22:53.207 --> 22:55.743
using back channels, we have
contacted Pierre Melville.

22:55.890 --> 22:58.198
He now believes
you are rogue CIA agents

22:58.199 --> 22:59.665
who want to sell the chip
back to him.

23:00.259 --> 23:02.004
So Pierre believes
we're traitors.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.105
But how does that
help us, General?

23:03.378 --> 23:04.679
You're going to sell him
a different chip.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.801
Spot on, Colonel.

23:08.371 --> 23:10.429
The chip suspended
in this liquid

23:10.430 --> 23:12.565
is a long-range tracking beacon.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.798
Return to the château.

23:13.799 --> 23:15.357
Swap cases with Pierre.

23:15.358 --> 23:17.058
Then our Paris office will
track him to whatever hole

23:17.668 --> 23:20.636
he's hiding in and root out
the entire terrorist cell.

23:20.849 --> 23:21.848
Is that clear?

23:21.849 --> 23:22.849
Yes, ma'am.

23:22.909 --> 23:25.077
Good, because you leave tonight.

23:26.469 --> 23:29.237
Agent Walker, a word.

23:34.515 --> 23:36.616
I want you to be the one
to make this drop.

23:37.574 --> 23:39.447
This operation
is highly sensitive.

23:39.448 --> 23:40.816
It must go smoothly.

23:41.193 --> 23:42.559
Of course, General.

23:43.066 --> 23:44.634
Dismissed.

23:47.933 --> 23:48.931
<i>All right, stick to the plan.</i>

23:48.932 --> 23:50.400
<i>Jinsana should be here</i>
<i>any minute.</i>

24:02.973 --> 24:04.439
Damn.

24:07.588 --> 24:10.023
Lester Patel,
you lucky little Canadian.

24:18.074 --> 24:20.380
Oh, my God.
She's a 12.

24:20.381 --> 24:23.216
It's the stuff of legend:
a flawless Hinjew specimen.

24:24.249 --> 24:25.436
I want her as my own, Jeffrey.

24:25.437 --> 24:26.704
Change of plans.
Marriage is on!

24:27.244 --> 24:27.868
Stop Big Mike,

24:27.869 --> 24:29.437
then stall her.

24:29.991 --> 24:31.659
I've got three fat girls
to break up with.

24:35.982 --> 24:36.948
You must be Jinsana.

24:38.165 --> 24:39.226
Yes, I am.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.894
Do you know where
Lester Patel is?

24:41.596 --> 24:42.656
Look, Jinsana,

24:42.657 --> 24:44.029
I know you've
traveled a long way.

24:44.030 --> 24:45.652
But I'm supposed to give you

24:45.653 --> 24:46.899
some bad news.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.901
Hi. Mr. Patel

24:49.024 --> 24:51.792
needs to reschedule.

24:52.580 --> 24:55.815
His calendar has
him free in, uh...

24:56.137 --> 24:57.937
a half hour.

24:59.257 --> 25:00.751
Okay.

25:00.752 --> 25:02.999
I guess I'll come back.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.122
Let me...
No.

25:04.123 --> 25:06.057
Come on, Chuck.
It's okay.

25:06.432 --> 25:07.741
It was so perfect.
Everything.

25:07.742 --> 25:09.115
The sunset.
The balcony.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.517
But listen, you cannot
beat yourself up over this.

25:10.612 --> 25:11.798
All right?
You were on a mission.

25:11.799 --> 25:13.366
There were distractions.
Things out of your control.

25:13.608 --> 25:15.542
Let's move past that.
Let me ask you something.

25:15.667 --> 25:18.703
What is the only thing
better than a sunset?

25:19.724 --> 25:22.059
Things going right
for a change?

25:22.344 --> 25:23.403
Moonlight.

25:23.404 --> 25:24.778
Okay?
Don't give up on me.

25:24.779 --> 25:26.279
You know the perfect
spot now, the balcony.

25:26.713 --> 25:28.707
You're going back
to the chÃ¢teau with Sarah.

25:28.708 --> 25:30.743
I mean, come on.
This is fate.

25:31.892 --> 25:34.060
The proposal's
gonna work, dude.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.133
It's lovely
to see you again, Jinsana.

25:36.134 --> 25:39.903
Mr. Lester Indira
Golda Patel awaits.

25:45.869 --> 25:47.936
This way, please.

25:50.112 --> 25:51.363
Welcome to my domain.

25:51.364 --> 25:53.607
Jinsana Gupta, please come. Sit.

25:53.608 --> 25:56.509
Sit.

25:57.417 --> 25:58.884
Look, Lester, I'm
just a normal...

25:59.659 --> 26:02.295
Shh.
I accept you.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.531
It is written.

26:06.532 --> 26:07.468
Jeffrey, please,

26:07.469 --> 26:10.104
with the poutine
and the Manischewitz.

26:10.342 --> 26:11.475
Lester,

26:11.528 --> 26:12.835
you're obviously
much more...

26:12.836 --> 26:16.438
traditional than I am.

26:16.517 --> 26:20.384
And the truth is, this is
freaking me out a little bit.

26:20.385 --> 26:21.752
Please, Jinsana.
Just-just look.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.413
I...

26:23.819 --> 26:26.553
I am not traditional at all,
actually.

26:30.309 --> 26:31.868
Look, this isn't the real me.

26:31.869 --> 26:33.802
All right? Please just-just-just
give me a chance to show you

26:33.803 --> 26:35.604
who the real Lester Patel is.

26:35.987 --> 26:38.454
I promise,
I make a fantastic...

26:43.973 --> 26:45.974
Third impression.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.084
So, this wasn't really you?

26:52.085 --> 26:53.752
No, no. I was...

26:54.458 --> 26:56.225
I was trying to impress you.

26:56.518 --> 26:57.700
Oh...

26:57.701 --> 26:58.868
That's kind of cute.

27:01.008 --> 27:02.196
Okay.

27:02.197 --> 27:04.565
We can give it another shot.
So it is written.

27:05.566 --> 27:07.061
No, no, no, no it's not written,

27:07.062 --> 27:08.496
Jeffrey.
Not written.

27:08.497 --> 27:11.064
Maybe we pencil it in.

27:18.606 --> 27:21.039
Hi, Morgan.
Oh. Sarah. Man.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.207
We need to have
a conversation.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.908
Holy hell, Sarah,
you just scared me to death.

27:24.909 --> 27:26.176
I thought you could have
been somebody deadly.

27:26.281 --> 27:27.447
I am somebody deadly.
Mm-hmm.

27:27.655 --> 27:28.755
And I know everything.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.149
The balcony?
The moonlight?

27:30.150 --> 27:31.316
Does that ring a bell?

27:31.961 --> 27:33.770
Okay, these bearded lips
are staying shut.

27:33.771 --> 27:34.704
I know nothing.

27:34.705 --> 27:36.638
Chuck is planning on
proposing at the chÃ¢teau.

27:36.639 --> 27:38.073
And I want your intel.

27:41.849 --> 27:44.183
Okay.
Don't you want to be surprised?

27:44.471 --> 27:46.239
I'm a spy.
I hate surprises.

27:46.654 --> 27:47.954
Okay. Uh, you know,
Chuck told me

27:47.963 --> 27:49.064
about your parents' proposal.

27:49.213 --> 27:50.583
I'm sorry. It'll
be better than that.

27:50.584 --> 27:53.151
Oh, God. I should never have
told him that stupid story.

27:53.579 --> 27:55.015
Probably not. Probably not.

27:55.016 --> 27:56.823
But you did,
and it's the whole reason

27:56.824 --> 27:57.991
we called off
our restaurant proposal.

27:58.074 --> 28:00.308
What? Wait.

28:00.881 --> 28:03.216
Chuck was planning on
proposing at the restaurant?

28:03.814 --> 28:04.687
What is wrong with me?

28:04.688 --> 28:06.373
I cannot keep my mouth shut.

28:06.374 --> 28:08.309
No. No. It's good.
It's good that you told me.

28:09.804 --> 28:10.864
Look, Sarah,

28:10.865 --> 28:12.498
the whole reason Chuck
is doing this proposal

28:12.674 --> 28:13.774
is to wipe the slate clean.

28:14.172 --> 28:16.167
All right?
It's, it's all for you.

28:16.168 --> 28:18.035
And it's going to be amazing
and it's gonna be romantic

28:19.351 --> 28:20.616
and it's gonna be
everything that you want.

28:21.722 --> 28:22.222
Okay.

28:22.223 --> 28:24.892
I am taking control of
this operation now.

28:25.343 --> 28:26.577
Morgan,

28:26.589 --> 28:28.556
you will now be
working for me.

28:29.335 --> 28:30.333
Okay.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.400
Kind of like a, uh...

28:32.020 --> 28:33.015
like a double agent.

28:33.016 --> 28:34.138
Exactly.

28:34.139 --> 28:35.739
We're going to make sure
this proposal happen.

28:35.951 --> 28:36.918
For Chuck's sake.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.794
Yeah.
And for mine.

28:53.991 --> 28:55.926
All right, Sarah, we got
a couple of French terrorists.

28:56.051 --> 28:57.052
A briefcase full of cash,

28:57.053 --> 28:58.298
and a weird nano-chip thingy.

28:58.299 --> 29:01.467
So, no more terrifying
than usual.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.233
Although, you know,
if we-- if we get done early,

29:03.289 --> 29:05.222
we could always take a little
stroll around the chÃ¢teau.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.792
That does sound lovely, Chuck.

29:08.220 --> 29:09.342
But... listen,

29:09.343 --> 29:11.090
I have this weird feeling
about this mission.

29:11.091 --> 29:12.192
I don't know why
I just can't shake it.

29:12.586 --> 29:15.187
Something... feels off.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.617
Sarah, it's Morgan.

29:19.704 --> 29:21.338
We're totally on a secure line.

29:23.697 --> 29:24.630
Okay, listen up.

29:24.631 --> 29:25.698
The proposal is a

29:25.816 --> 29:27.565
"go," on the western balcony,

29:27.566 --> 29:29.247
all right? Now,
lunar calculations

29:29.248 --> 29:30.848
are complete, and we are banking

29:31.245 --> 29:32.243
on a full moon proposal--

29:32.244 --> 29:34.277
that is a full...
moon... proposal.

29:34.429 --> 29:35.696
Copy that, Morgan. Now listen,

29:35.800 --> 29:37.047
if anything goes wrong,

29:37.048 --> 29:39.015
you are to tell me
about it immediately.

29:39.170 --> 29:40.167
Of course. Absolutely.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.302
I am on it.
You can count on me.

29:42.289 --> 29:44.757
Hey, Morgan.
Oh, hold on a second.

29:44.974 --> 29:47.576
I have to scram, because,
uh, Chuck is on two.

29:48.405 --> 29:49.716
Hey, Chuck, how are ya?

29:49.717 --> 29:51.551
How's the man? How's the myth?
How is the view?

29:51.777 --> 29:53.211
Does Sarah seem jumpy to you?

29:53.770 --> 29:55.081
I mean, do you think
she's on to us?

29:55.082 --> 29:56.083
What? No. No... !

29:56.084 --> 29:58.352
Sarah, on to us?
Come on buddy, get real.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.807
Keep your head in the game
though, all right?

30:00.137 --> 30:01.259
I need your focus, here.
And if I can give you

30:01.260 --> 30:02.527
one piece of, sort of like, I
don't know,  fatherly advice,

30:02.634 --> 30:03.868
I'd just like to tell...

30:04.505 --> 30:06.306
Are you futzing with
the ring box right now?

30:08.685 --> 30:09.560
No.

30:09.561 --> 30:11.118
I can hear you futzing
with the ring box, Chuck.

30:11.119 --> 30:12.452
If you keep futzing
with the ring box,

30:12.490 --> 30:13.523
you're gonna tarnish the sheen.

30:13.804 --> 30:14.615
What's the matter?
Are you nervous?

30:14.616 --> 30:15.735
'Cause when you're nervous,
you get all sweaty.

30:15.736 --> 30:17.103
And when you get...
Relax, okay? Okay, buddy?

30:17.610 --> 30:19.144
I got it. I...

30:19.170 --> 30:21.339
Yeah-ah, I gotta go.
I gotta go. We've got company.

30:25.471 --> 30:26.282
Please go smoothly.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.383
Please go smoothly.

30:28.653 --> 30:30.402
It rains in Paris, <i>mon cherie.</i>

30:30.403 --> 30:33.840
But only in the spring.

30:41.071 --> 30:42.318
It's done.
That was easy.

30:42.319 --> 30:43.386
What? We're done?
We're done?

30:43.444 --> 30:44.811
Seriously? Great!
Good. We're done.

30:45.565 --> 30:46.189
Bravo! Excellent work.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.374
Fantastic. Um...

30:47.375 --> 30:49.043
Meet me at our...
at our balcony.

30:49.370 --> 30:50.679
And, uh, we'll...
we'll celebrate

30:50.680 --> 30:51.612
with a glass of wine.

30:51.930 --> 30:53.797
I'll meet you there.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.729
It's time to
come clean.

31:04.784 --> 31:05.468
This girl is about

31:05.469 --> 31:07.270
to meet the real Lester.

31:07.592 --> 31:09.326
And Jeff.

31:09.529 --> 31:11.896
Let's just keep the
focus on me, okay, buddy?

31:14.955 --> 31:17.857
Hey, Jinsana, listen...

31:18.049 --> 31:20.044
I am... sorry

31:20.045 --> 31:22.046
that I pretended to be
somebody that I'm not.

31:22.666 --> 31:24.037
So, behold...

31:24.038 --> 31:25.472
the real Lester Patel,

31:25.473 --> 31:27.239
uncut, unabridged...

31:28.593 --> 31:29.966
in living color.

31:29.967 --> 31:31.768
Should we go get
a drink or something?

31:31.775 --> 31:33.142
Something?

31:33.215 --> 31:34.215
Jeffrey, hit it!

32:34.177 --> 32:35.175
Morgan, the mission

Wait-wait-wait-wait,

34:15.766 --> 34:16.766
you little elf.

Wait a minute.

34:20.446 --> 34:24.248
Are you conducting
a sub-mission?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.101
He's gonna pop the question
to Walker, isn't he?

34:27.933 --> 34:28.931
How did you know that?

34:28.931 --> 34:30.800
'Cause I'm a spy,
not a moron.

34:30.996 --> 34:31.962

34:32.053 --> 34:34.087
gonna need all the
help he can get.

34:43.906 --> 34:44.781
Sarah?

34:44.782 --> 34:46.341
You just stopped.
What's the matter?

34:46.342 --> 34:47.475
I don't know.

34:48.154 --> 34:48.899
I think,

34:48.900 --> 34:50.083
for the first time in my life,

34:50.085 --> 34:52.621
I'm... nervous.

34:53.266 --> 34:54.949
Oh... my God.

34:54.951 --> 34:56.197
Oh, my God.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.448
You have butterflies.
She has butterflies.
Yeah.

34:58.449 --> 35:00.249
That's completely natural,
that it's...

35:00.880 --> 35:02.003
Everybody gets butterflies.

35:02.004 --> 35:03.371
Morgan, I don't get butterflies.

35:04.125 --> 35:04.996
That's not what I'm saying.

35:04.997 --> 35:06.164
What I'm saying is...

35:06.371 --> 35:08.744
that's Chuck Bartowski
out on that balcony, okay?

35:08.745 --> 35:09.812
You know, he-he is the...

35:09.866 --> 35:10.832
the best friend

35:11.050 --> 35:12.383
that I've ever had.

35:12.487 --> 35:13.687
No offense.

35:14.359 --> 35:15.107
And listen,

35:15.108 --> 35:16.916
I know you weren't, uh, asking.

35:16.917 --> 35:18.684
And maybe it's a little silly,
but, uh...

35:19.225 --> 35:21.470
you have my permission
to marry him.

35:21.471 --> 35:23.472
He's all yours. So...

35:23.781 --> 35:25.382
All right, take care of him.

35:25.529 --> 35:27.729
Thank you, Morgan.

35:33.079 --> 35:34.079
Uh-oh.

35:34.513 --> 35:35.447
We have a problem.

35:36.325 --> 35:37.197
No. What are
you talking... ?

35:37.198 --> 35:38.165
Sarah just has
butterflies...
Look, moron.

35:38.819 --> 35:40.352
Look! The ring.

35:41.939 --> 35:42.813
Walker!

35:42.814 --> 35:43.937
Check your six.
By your feet.

35:43.938 --> 35:46.005
Bartowski dropped the ring.

35:49.739 --> 35:50.705
Oh, my God.
Pick it up.

35:51.175 --> 35:52.109
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.476
Look at the moon, Chuck.

36:02.976 --> 36:04.511
It's perfect.

36:26.307 --> 36:27.740
I've been to so many...

36:27.741 --> 36:29.108
places around the world, but

36:29.366 --> 36:30.799
never been to a place

36:30.800 --> 36:32.501
as beautiful as this.

36:33.172 --> 36:34.406
I have.

36:36.976 --> 36:38.342
Every day.

36:40.782 --> 36:43.050
Every morning I wake up,
and I look at you...

36:44.089 --> 36:45.961
when we...

36:45.962 --> 36:47.861
brush our teeth tandem-style.

36:49.581 --> 36:51.204
When we watch
TV together.

36:51.205 --> 36:52.389
Whatever, anything, always,

36:52.390 --> 36:54.358
every time I look at you...

36:54.575 --> 36:56.476
It's the most beautiful place
I've ever been.

37:00.189 --> 37:01.374
I just, I feel,
I feel like I-I

37:01.375 --> 37:02.907
should be James Bond
right now, you know?

37:02.998 --> 37:04.932
The-the guy who's standing
on this balcony w-with you

37:05.682 --> 37:06.809
right now in
this moment, I mean...

37:06.810 --> 37:08.113
I didn't fall in love
with James Bond.

37:08.114 --> 37:09.514
I fell in love with you.

37:09.985 --> 37:10.798
Here we go.
Here we go.

37:10.799 --> 37:12.000
She is good, huh?
Yep, yep.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.448
Sarah, um, um...

37:22.599 --> 37:24.089
I'm-I'm-I'm going to ask you
a question right now.

37:24.090 --> 37:25.023
So please don't freak out,

37:25.088 --> 37:26.321
okay?

37:26.773 --> 37:27.906
I won't.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.260
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

37:31.827 --> 37:32.794
Going on missions...

37:32.949 --> 37:33.882
and saving the day

37:33.949 --> 37:35.181
and being heroes,
but mostly, though,

37:35.508 --> 37:37.175
I just want to be with you.

37:38.629 --> 37:40.730
At your side. Always.

37:50.109 --> 37:51.875
Sarah.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.330
Will you...

37:56.037 --> 37:57.737
Freeze! Don't move! CIA!

37:59.159 --> 38:00.903
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-what's
going on here?!

38:00.904 --> 38:02.090
We're on a mission?
What are you doing?

38:02.091 --> 38:03.024
It's legit.

38:03.714 --> 38:04.523
Agent Sarah Walker,

38:04.524 --> 38:05.457
you're under
arrest.

38:05.522 --> 38:07.122
For what?!
Treason.

38:08.332 --> 38:09.328
What?!

38:09.329 --> 38:10.950
No! No!

38:10.951 --> 38:11.699
Hey!

38:11.700 --> 38:13.001
Hey!
Wait!

38:24.339 --> 38:25.087
How... how could anyone possibly

38:25.088 --> 38:26.277
think that Sarah's a traitor?
I mean, I mean, look,

38:26.278 --> 38:27.211
look at this stuff.

38:27.835 --> 38:28.768
Look at this stuff, Casey.

38:29.207 --> 38:30.081
She was making the drop

38:30.082 --> 38:31.150
because that was our mission.
Sit down,

38:31.515 --> 38:34.483
Bartowski, you're
making me dizzy.

38:40.251 --> 38:40.936
I was going to propose

38:40.937 --> 38:42.070
to her, Casey.

38:49.176 --> 38:51.777
You know, I proposed once.

38:58.971 --> 39:01.139
To Kathleen.

39:01.342 --> 39:03.844
We had plans to go
to Niagara Falls.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.132
I was about to ship out.

39:06.896 --> 39:07.833
But we were young,

39:07.834 --> 39:08.768
and I was stupid,

39:08.769 --> 39:09.736
and things got screwed up,

39:09.891 --> 39:11.191
so I ended up proposing

39:11.327 --> 39:13.428
in a Buffalo bus station.

39:14.154 --> 39:17.956
Not exactly the most
romantic spot in the world.

39:18.901 --> 39:20.767
But I'll always have that day.

39:20.768 --> 39:23.003
I'll always have
that look on her face.

39:24.078 --> 39:25.509
You know, the truth is,
there's no such thing

39:25.510 --> 39:27.644
as a perfect moment
or perfect spot.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.816
So...

39:29.817 --> 39:32.485
forget about the balcony,
Bartowski.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.667
All you need is the girl.

39:49.269 --> 39:50.453
General, General.

39:50.454 --> 39:51.620
Please, please, please.

39:51.951 --> 39:52.763
Go ahead, Chuck.

39:52.764 --> 39:54.563
You two have
some things to discuss.

40:07.179 --> 40:08.925
I don't need a balcony,
and I don't need a sunset.

40:08.926 --> 40:10.593
We have each other, and
that's all that matters.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.421
Chuck, I'm leaving.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.388
What?

40:21.843 --> 40:23.043
Where are they taking you?

40:23.215 --> 40:25.783
They're not taking me, Chuck.
I'm going.

40:27.270 --> 40:28.837
Beckman never thought
that I was a traitor.

40:29.267 --> 40:30.200
It was a setup.

40:30.205 --> 40:32.473
The perfect opportunity to...

40:32.762 --> 40:33.949
to establish my cover

40:33.950 --> 40:37.118
as a double agent.

40:38.815 --> 40:41.583
Chuck, we have
so much together.

40:42.061 --> 40:42.932
We have...

40:42.933 --> 40:46.102
a real life
and a future.

40:46.365 --> 40:48.177
But I need to go back
to being the old me,

40:48.178 --> 40:50.012
just... for
a little while longer,

40:51.295 --> 40:53.353
if I plan on surviving this.

40:53.354 --> 40:54.821
Surviving what?
Where are you going?

40:56.037 --> 40:58.720
I'm going undercover
into Volkoff Industries.

40:58.721 --> 40:59.855
No.
I'm going to
take them down

41:00.155 --> 41:01.905
from the inside.
No. No,
you're not.

41:01.906 --> 41:03.336
That's exactly
how I lost my mom.

41:03.337 --> 41:04.904
That's exactly how you are
going to get her back.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.712
Chuck, I'm doing this
for you, okay?

41:06.713 --> 41:08.247
I'm doing it for us!

41:09.766 --> 41:10.762
Why does it have to be you?

41:10.763 --> 41:12.135
Chuck, you have to trust me,
okay?

41:12.136 --> 41:14.270
For Beckman's plan to work,
it has to be me.

41:15.195 --> 41:16.963
I'm sorry.

41:18.627 --> 41:21.096
Agent Walker, it's time.

41:25.928 --> 41:27.114
I love you.

41:27.115 --> 41:28.915
I love you, too, Chuck.

41:30.107 --> 41:33.242
I'm not going to come back
without your mom.
