01:36.329 --> 01:41.096
We are now beginning our descent
into JFKlnternational Airport.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.635
We should be on the ground in 15 minutes.

01:43.703 --> 01:48.606
Any passenger needing help
with customs forms or any other form...

02:39.058 --> 02:40.992
Monsieur?

02:44.364 --> 02:46.298
Monsieur?

03:55.668 --> 03:57.659
Come in.

04:00.406 --> 04:04.604
- Thank you for getting here so quickly.
- There's not much traffic at this hour.

04:04.677 --> 04:09.478
This is Dr Simon Bruin with the Philadelphia
office of the Centers for Disease Control.

04:09.549 --> 04:12.177
A pleasure, Dr Scully.

04:14.687 --> 04:18.521
How familiar are you
with the kidnappings in Philadelphia?

04:18.591 --> 04:23.995
Only what l've read: that four young men
have gone missing in the past three months.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.621
All African-American.

04:25.698 --> 04:29.964
Ajoint FBl-Philadelphia PD task force
has been working around the clock.

04:30.036 --> 04:33.665
But there have been no leads
to speak of. Until last night.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.605
What happened last night?

04:35.675 --> 04:40.009
Owen Sanders, the last to go missing,
was found dead near a construction site.

04:40.079 --> 04:44.413
- How was he killed?
- That's just it, Agent Scully. He wasn't.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.509
No evidence indicates homicide.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.747
Has a cause of death been determined?

04:48.821 --> 04:52.382
No. But l'll let Dr Bruin
give you his thoughts on that.

04:54.694 --> 04:59.290
This was taken last night, less than
an hour after Sanders' body was found.

04:59.365 --> 05:03.631
- l thought you said Owen Sanders was black.
- He was.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.731
l'm not sure l follow.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.800
See for yourself.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.606
Owen Sanders
was a normal young black man.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.512
l assume you're going somewhere with this.

05:15.581 --> 05:20.245
The depigmentation may
actually be characteristic of a disease.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.288
An apparently fatal one.

05:24.223 --> 05:27.215
So you don't think
they're victims of a crime at all.

05:27.293 --> 05:32.458
lt's my opinion, Dr Scully, this investigation
should begin and end under a microscope.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.530
Dr Bruin hopes someone
with a solid medical background

05:36.602 --> 05:39.594
can make a quick and decisive analysis.

05:40.673 --> 05:44.871
Case number 2139318537.

05:45.244 --> 05:48.270
Subject is a black male, 19 years old.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.476
Cause and time of death unknown.

05:51.551 --> 05:56.215
Note: total lack of pigment in the skin,
hair and eyes.

05:57.056 --> 06:00.992
This suggests albinism,
though the bleaching of the irises

06:01.060 --> 06:06.157
indicates a violent and unexplained cellular
reaction to a vector or an environment.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.501
l heard you were down here
slicing and dicing. Who's the lucky stiff?

06:12.572 --> 06:14.631
His name is Owen Sanders.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.767
Reported as the fourth
kidnap victim in Philadelphia

06:17.844 --> 06:20.745
until he turned up last night like this.

06:20.813 --> 06:24.647
There's a Michael Jackson joke in here,
but l can't quite find it.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.676
l've been requested to determine
what leached the pigment from his body.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.747
- Requested by whom?
- The Centers for Disease Control.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.758
The CDC in a kidnap case?

06:33.826 --> 06:36.852
They believe the case has been mislabeled.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.827
That this man and the others may have
fallen prey to a disease or a pathogen.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.765
Based on what other evidence?

06:42.835 --> 06:48.239
There were no signs of trauma or defense
wounds, and his wallet was still full of cash.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.303
That's interesting.

06:52.445 --> 06:56.279
What sort of disease is this?

06:56.349 --> 07:00.547
l don't know. There are conditions
like vitiligo which attack melanocytes

07:00.620 --> 07:03.350
and prevent the manufacture
of melanin in the skin,

07:03.423 --> 07:05.983
autoimmune disorders, not yet understood.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.322
So this man died of a disorder?

07:08.394 --> 07:11.329
He and four other young black men
contracted the disease

07:11.397 --> 07:14.833
and then disappeared
without any explanation whatsoever.

07:14.901 --> 07:19.031
lt's possible they've already turned up,
but because of the depigmentation

07:19.105 --> 07:21.300
there may be a problem with identification.

07:21.374 --> 07:25.174
So l have reissued descriptions
of John Does to area morgues and ERs.

07:25.244 --> 07:29.510
Scully, has it occurred to you
that this mightjust be a PR exercise?

07:29.582 --> 07:30.412
l'm sorry?

07:30.483 --> 07:35.216
To divert attention from the fact that young
black men are dying and there's no suspect?

07:35.288 --> 07:39.588
- The perception being that nobody cares.
- Not everything is a conspiracy,

07:39.659 --> 07:44.426
and not everybody is plotting
to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.191
Did you lift any forensic evidence?

07:48.267 --> 07:51.862
Yes. Hair, skin and fiber.
Behind you on the counter.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.203
What are you doing?

07:58.277 --> 08:03.374
l'm gonnajoin the snipe hunt, if you
don't mind. Before the body count rises.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.286
Mr Aboah?

08:26.973 --> 08:29.134
Anyone home?

08:36.414 --> 08:38.405
Samuel Aboah?

08:39.552 --> 08:40.883
Yes.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.648
l'm Marcus Duff. Remember me?

08:45.725 --> 08:47.556
Your immigration counselor.

08:47.627 --> 08:52.030
We have an appointment
to go over your naturalization petition.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.725
Please.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.733
Thank you.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.485
We could use a little light
to fill out the petition.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.545
Maybe you can open a window or something.

09:27.733 --> 09:30.327
Yeah... l guess that works.

09:30.937 --> 09:34.338
Have a seat, Samuel.
This is a little complicated.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.735
So...

09:42.782 --> 09:45.012
You OK? You look ill.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.518
You got a fever or something?

09:48.988 --> 09:50.080
No.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.725
l know how lonely it is, believe me.

09:57.630 --> 10:01.191
Being in a strange place
far from your family.

10:01.267 --> 10:05.226
But once you become a US citizen,

10:05.972 --> 10:10.568
l can help you bring over
every brother, sister,

10:10.643 --> 10:12.736
aunt, uncle and cousin.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.916
lt all starts today, Samuel.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.147
Know what l'm saying?

10:23.122 --> 10:25.113
Thank you.

10:29.929 --> 10:34.992
Agent Pendrell. Thanks for turning this
materials analysis around on short notice.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.661
Shouldn't we wait for Agent Scully?

10:37.737 --> 10:39.671
- She's not coming.
- Why not?

10:39.739 --> 10:42.173
She had a date.

10:42.241 --> 10:45.335
Breathe! lt's with a dead man.
She's doing an autopsy.

10:45.411 --> 10:50.075
- You said you found something?
- Yeah. Asbestos fibers. Not much there.

10:50.149 --> 10:55.644
And l didn't think there was anything among
the vegetable debris - local soils, pollens, etc.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.916
Till l came across this.

10:58.157 --> 11:02.821
l had to go on-line with a botanist
at UVN to determine what it was.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.863
lt looks like some kind of thorn.

11:04.930 --> 11:09.697
No, it's a seed, actually. But nothing
you'll find at your local nursery.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.229
Adenia volkensii.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.909
- Help me out.
- From a rare species of passionflower.

11:17.977 --> 11:23.005
lt's a rare, night-blooming plant indigenous
only to certain parts of West Africa.

11:25.117 --> 11:30.316
How could this travel 5,000 miles around
the world and wind up on Owen Sanders?

11:30.389 --> 11:32.323
That l couldn't tell you.

11:32.391 --> 11:35.827
lt contains a cerebropathic glycoside.
Mean anything to you?

11:35.895 --> 11:40.389
lf l'm correct, it's a cortical depressant that
works on the higher centers of the brain.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.196
- ls it lethal?
- ln large enough quantities it might be.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.033
Larger than anything
contained in a single seed.

11:46.238 --> 11:50.038
Did the toxicology screen
detect any of it in Sanders' blood?

11:50.109 --> 11:53.101
No, the tox screen was clean.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.306
Could his body have metabolized it?

11:56.916 --> 12:00.113
Only if the victim hadn't expired immediately.

12:00.619 --> 12:04.851
- Does that tell you anything about anything?
- No, but...

12:05.091 --> 12:09.118
l think l found something
that could explain the depigmentation.

12:09.195 --> 12:13.393
- His pituitary gland was necrotized.
- His pituitary gland?

12:13.466 --> 12:17.095
The pituitary gland secretes all of the
regulatory hormones in the body,

12:17.169 --> 12:20.297
and it controls the production
of melanin in the skin cells.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.840
So you found evidence
that this is a disease?

12:22.908 --> 12:27.845
No. l have identified the effect.
l am still looking for the cause.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.677
OK, let me know
as soon as you find anything out.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.551
- Where are you, Mulder?
- Off to water the seeds of doubt. Bye-bye.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.015
Ms Covarrubias?

13:15.528 --> 13:19.726
- Who are you?
- Agent Mulder. Fox Mulder.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.224
- What are you doing?
- l'm sorry l frightened you.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.564
What do you want?

13:24.637 --> 13:28.437
l'm not sure why, but l thought
you might be in a position to help me.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.031
Help you?

13:30.109 --> 13:34.603
Four young men are missing in Philadelphia.
One of the men was found dead last night.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.080
This seed was recovered from his body.

13:37.149 --> 13:41.483
lt's from a rare species of plant
found only in West Africa.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.546
Do you know anything about this case?

13:44.623 --> 13:45.590
No.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.685
ls there any way you could find
something out about it?

13:50.830 --> 13:55.733
Thousands of exotic species
cross into US soil every day undetected.

13:56.535 --> 14:00.869
Bilge water is emptied into harbors,
produce sent through the mail.

14:00.940 --> 14:05.639
ln practical terms,
borders are little more than lines on maps.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.670
ls that a yes or a no?

14:09.415 --> 14:12.680
- l can't help you.
- You can't or you won't?

14:13.118 --> 14:16.144
You made an overture to me.
You left an opening.

14:16.222 --> 14:20.852
Tell me l'm wrong. Tell me there's
nothing here, and l'll just walk away.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.151
Either way, l need to know.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.362
Hey, l got a schedule.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.300
You gettin' on or not?

15:38.437 --> 15:41.429
What's your problem?
You on drugs or something?

15:42.308 --> 15:46.244
Ah, the hell with you.
You can walk for all l care.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.280
Damned drugs.

16:10.769 --> 16:16.207
He was sitting right here, staring at me
with these glassy eyes. Pretty much out of it.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.368
You mean he looked sick?

16:18.444 --> 16:20.469
Yeah, now that you mention it.

16:20.546 --> 16:24.380
l mean, l asked him if he needed help,
but he didn't say squat.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.016
Don't forget to put down
l had a schedule to keep.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.612
Did you observe anybody else in the area?

16:30.689 --> 16:35.092
Not that l saw. l already told the police
pretty much everything l know.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.528
Excuse me.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.294
- What happened?
- We have another missing young man.

16:42.368 --> 16:47.704
Alfred Kittel, 17 years old, African-American.
His mother called the police around 3am.

16:47.773 --> 16:51.140
- How does she know he's missing?
- He works down the street.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.509
He takes this bus every night,
and last night he never made it home.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.276
They found his knapsack on the bench here.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.715
The police are out canvassing.

16:59.785 --> 17:04.415
l talked to a bus driver who said that
he seemed disoriented, nonresponsive.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.823
lt might be some kind of
pre-symptomatic dementia.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.994
Or a reaction
to a powerful cortical depressant.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.696
What are you suggesting?

17:12.765 --> 17:16.895
Find Alfred Kittel and you find
another one of those rare African seeds.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.231
What makes you so sure?

17:18.303 --> 17:21.534
A week before the first person
was reported missing

17:21.607 --> 17:24.940
the New York Port Authority
filed that with the FAA.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.535
Like Owen Sanders,
this man wasn't an albino either.

17:27.613 --> 17:32.277
Not until he was found dead on a charter
flight from West Africa, from Burkina Faso.

17:32.484 --> 17:36.614
The embassy demanded the body's return
before an autopsy could be performed.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.156
lt says cause of death was undetermined.

17:39.224 --> 17:43.251
Yeah, undetermined, Scully,
but not necessarily unknown.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.168
''Aboah''? What the hell kind of name is that?

18:03.982 --> 18:05.313
Mr Aboah?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.554
- Yes.
- Philadelphia PD.

18:09.621 --> 18:13.057
We're canvassing the building
in regard to a missing person.

18:13.125 --> 18:17.323
This is the young man we're looking for.
Have you seen him?

18:19.531 --> 18:20.657
No.

18:20.732 --> 18:25.101
Well, if you hear from anyone who has,
or come across any information at all,

18:25.170 --> 18:30.164
you can reach us at this number.
That's a hot line. You can call 24 hours a day.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.844
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:20.626 --> 19:24.619
- l am really quite busy.
- We won't take up much of your time.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.722
You're in charge of most of the casework

19:27.799 --> 19:30.563
for aliens immigrating
from Africa and the Caribbean?

19:30.636 --> 19:34.538
l assist people from that part of the world
where l came from 15 years ago.

19:34.606 --> 19:39.600
We're looking for somebody that came
more recently. On a flight from Burkina Faso.

19:39.678 --> 19:43.774
This is the passenger manifest
from the charter company.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.012
And... you want me to do what, exactly?

19:47.186 --> 19:51.350
Cross-reference the names with anyone
applying for permanent resident status

19:51.423 --> 19:53.653
or a work visa in the last three months.

19:53.725 --> 19:59.095
l am a social worker, not a police officer.
My business is not chasing down illegals.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.257
Sir, we're not here to arrest anybody.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.734
But you are FBl agents, are you not?

20:04.803 --> 20:08.295
Yes. lnvestigating
a possible public health crisis.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.277
What kind of crisis?

20:30.896 --> 20:34.127
He's not at home.
We might as well get comfortable.

20:35.234 --> 20:40.228
lt has to be here, Mulder. There has to be
some evidence of a virus or bacterium.

20:40.973 --> 20:45.273
lf you looked up from the microscope,
you'd see that what's missing is a motive.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.813
The motive of any pathogen
is to reproduce itself.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.646
My job as a doctor is to find out
if and how it is being transmitted.

20:52.718 --> 20:56.711
- lf this is a health crisis.
- Death is a health crisis.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.348
Something caused Sanders' pituitary to fail,

20:59.424 --> 21:05.090
which caused his metabolism to drop,
resulting in coma and, finally, in death.

21:05.797 --> 21:08.664
Sometimes you have to start at the end
to find the beginning.

21:08.734 --> 21:12.568
l just hope we don't have to find
another dead body to discover what that is.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.731
Maybe we won't have to wait.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.102
Mr Aboah? Can l talk to you a minute?

21:35.394 --> 21:38.386
- Boy, this guy can move.
- He's not here.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.022
He has to be.

22:01.953 --> 22:05.389
Mulder, l think l know where he went.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.727
Come on, Mulder. Let's go. We've lost him.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.873
Hey, Scully, look at this.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.587
Oh, my God.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.025
From outward signs,
this man is asymptomatic.

23:21.099 --> 23:25.468
l appreciate the connection you've tried
to make, but it's a dead end.

23:26.505 --> 23:31.670
With your permission, l'd like to examine
him more. l'd like to run a suppression test

23:31.743 --> 23:35.179
do a TSH screen, take a history.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.715
lt would help if we could talk to him.

23:38.016 --> 23:40.348
l'm working on that.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.752
- Nothing?
- Not yet.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.953
That doesn't mean he isn't a carrier,
or even the index case.

23:50.028 --> 23:53.020
He's some kind of case, the way
he disappeared down that drainpipe.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.590
Why has Samuel Aboah been arrested?

23:57.803 --> 24:01.534
You said his health was in danger.
Why have l been lied to?

24:01.907 --> 24:03.807
Nobody has lied to you, sir.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.537
Then, please, release him immediately.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.670
We would like to do some more tests.

24:08.747 --> 24:12.911
We have to be sure his health hasn't been
endangered and he isn't endangering others.

24:12.984 --> 24:16.078
- Then why have you called me?
- As a translator.

24:16.154 --> 24:18.884
We'd like to be able
to ask him some questions.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.448
- About what?
- About Alfred Kittel

24:21.526 --> 24:26.691
and several other men who've gone missing
since his arrival in Philadelphia.

24:26.765 --> 24:31.134
- Then this is about a criminal charge.
- There are no charges against Mr Aboah.

24:31.203 --> 24:35.230
We arrested him because he ran when
we tried to question him. l wanna know why.

24:35.307 --> 24:39.641
Sir, if you had ever been beaten
by the police,

24:40.278 --> 24:43.907
or had your home burned
for no other reason than being born,

24:43.982 --> 24:47.474
then, maybe,
you would understand why he ran.

24:47.552 --> 24:49.281
And why you would run too.

24:50.355 --> 24:54.519
He ran because he's hiding something.
And no amount of tests you run on him,

24:54.593 --> 24:58.085
- no science is gonna find that. Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

24:58.163 --> 25:02.827
To find someone who l know plotted
to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.674
Minister, this is Agent Mulder with the FBl.

25:17.749 --> 25:22.914
- Thank you for seeing me at such a late hour.
- l did not have much choice in this matter.

25:23.855 --> 25:27.757
Someone from the United Nations
spoke to the ambassador.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.554
What's so important that it can't wait?

25:31.730 --> 25:34.426
With all due respect, sir,
l think you already know.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.797
Do l?

25:36.868 --> 25:40.497
Something happened on a flight
from your country three months ago.

25:40.572 --> 25:44.906
Something that you felt compelled to hide,
even from your own ambassador.

25:44.976 --> 25:49.504
The request to stop investigating
this man's death came from you.

25:53.285 --> 25:58.917
l understand the need to protect your
diplomatic position, but more men are dying.

26:03.194 --> 26:05.890
Even if l tell you what l know...

26:07.532 --> 26:09.966
you would never believe it.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.629
You'd be surprised at what l believe, sir.

26:15.173 --> 26:17.801
l had hoped, if l closed my eyes,

26:18.176 --> 26:21.043
it would go away this time.

26:21.112 --> 26:23.103
This time?

26:24.549 --> 26:26.540
My people,...

26:28.587 --> 26:31.317
the Bambara, are farmers.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.923
l grew up hearing the old stories,...

26:36.061 --> 26:39.656
believing them as only a child can believe.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.597
What kinds of stories?

26:44.569 --> 26:46.560
The Teliko.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.764
Spirits...

26:51.543 --> 26:53.534
of the air.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.040
lt was said they rested by day

26:58.116 --> 27:00.414
in closed, dark places

27:00.485 --> 27:03.215
deep inside tree hollows

27:03.288 --> 27:05.984
and in holes beneath the ground,

27:06.291 --> 27:10.352
too small even for a child to hide himself.

27:11.796 --> 27:12.888
Mr Aboah?

27:14.733 --> 27:17.702
Only when the sun fell,

27:17.769 --> 27:21.000
when the rest of the world was sleeping,

27:21.072 --> 27:23.233
would they come out.

27:23.908 --> 27:26.468
Come out to do what, sir?

27:27.445 --> 27:29.845
l was seven years old.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.810
Lying awake one night, l saw him.

27:34.886 --> 27:37.116
He was standing over me.

27:37.689 --> 27:40.419
His hair was like straw,

27:40.492 --> 27:43.256
his eyes like water,

27:43.928 --> 27:46.522
staring down at me.

27:46.765 --> 27:50.201
l closed my eyes and screamed,

27:50.769 --> 27:54.296
and felt myself being swept up into the air.

27:57.275 --> 28:00.244
But when l opened my eyes,

28:00.845 --> 28:02.813
l saw my father

28:02.881 --> 28:04.644
holding me.

28:04.716 --> 28:08.311
- Then it was a nightmare.
- That's what my father said.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.680
And l believed him.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.486
Until the next day,...

28:14.392 --> 28:16.758
when they found my cousin

28:16.828 --> 28:19.160
dead among his cattle.

28:22.901 --> 28:26.098
Looking exactly like this man.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.070
Which is why,

28:36.147 --> 28:40.413
when this photograph
came across my desk three months ago,

28:41.853 --> 28:46.517
l knew the Teliko
was more than just a children's story.

28:46.758 --> 28:49.124
l knew it was real.

28:50.929 --> 28:53.159
l knew he was here!

29:03.708 --> 29:08.304
This patient has something in his throat,
some kind of aberrant bone growth,

29:08.379 --> 29:11.576
or maybe something foreign
lodged in his esophagus.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.142
Could be a lot of things.

29:14.619 --> 29:19.283
You'd be amazed what l've seen
removed from people's throats in ERs.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.154
That's only part of it.

29:21.226 --> 29:26.061
l discovered something even more disturbing
when his PET series came back.

29:27.098 --> 29:31.865
Look right here on the sagittal section,
right below the hypothalamus.

29:32.537 --> 29:35.973
- There must be some mistake.
- There's no mistake.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.770
This patient has no pituitary gland.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.805
That's not possible.

29:40.879 --> 29:44.713
l can't even begin to explain
what we're seeing here, sir.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.684
l just hope this patient
can provide some answers.

29:47.752 --> 29:50.312
You'll have to find him first.

29:50.388 --> 29:53.516
- What are you talking about?
- l was looking for you in Quarantine.

29:53.591 --> 29:56.219
Samuel Aboah is gone, disappeared.

30:30.528 --> 30:31.859
Samuel?

30:34.399 --> 30:36.390
You scared me.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.833
They let you out of the hospital?

30:43.441 --> 30:44.533
Yes.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.842
Everything is fine?

30:48.413 --> 30:49.744
Samuel?

30:50.582 --> 30:53.107
Did you want to see me about something?

30:56.020 --> 31:00.753
Well, come on. Let me give you a ride home.
We can talk about it on the way.

31:01.226 --> 31:04.218
Lucky for you l was working late.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.354
Yes. Lucky.

31:06.664 --> 31:08.655
Come, let's go.

31:19.911 --> 31:22.243
When did this happen?

31:23.581 --> 31:26.573
Thank you, Lieutenant. l appreciate it.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.978
l think this was his getaway vehicle.

31:31.356 --> 31:34.257
He didn't even touch his Jell-O.

31:34.325 --> 31:37.852
Let's go. Marcus Duff's car
turned up abandoned

31:37.929 --> 31:41.490
with the keys in the ignition
and the hood still hot.

32:20.305 --> 32:25.572
6834, requesting ambulance
in alley behind 1163 West Cherry.

32:25.643 --> 32:28.908
Man down.
Victim: African-American male, aged 35...

32:32.317 --> 32:36.617
- Do you know what happened to him?
- l won't even try to guess, but he's alive.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.384
What about Aboah?
Any indication of where he might be?

32:39.457 --> 32:42.949
We're still sweeping the area.
l'll keep you posted.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.994
He's gotta be around here.
He can't have gotten far.

32:46.064 --> 32:48.999
He can squeeze into a coffee can.
He could be anywhere.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.627
- They'll find him.
- They'll find another victim.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.605
- We interrupted him before he could finish.
- lnterrupted his killing Duff?

32:55.673 --> 32:59.939
The killing is just incidental, l think,
to a far more basic need.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.300
What need?

33:01.379 --> 33:06.339
lf Aboah has no pituitary, then his body
couldn't produce melanin itself, right?

33:06.417 --> 33:07.816
Theoretically, yes.

33:07.885 --> 33:12.015
Well, when you examined him
you didn't observe one single albino trait.

33:12.090 --> 33:16.584
Considering his PET scan results, l don't
even know how he managed to stay alive.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.892
That's what l'm talking about: survival.
And notjust Aboah's.

33:19.964 --> 33:25.027
l think the anomaly you observed is notjust
physiological. l think it may be evolutionary.

33:25.103 --> 33:29.631
- What are you talking about?
- A lost tribe, a clan of sub-Saharan albinos

33:29.707 --> 33:34.167
linked by a common congenital deficit,
who've adapted over generations by...

33:34.245 --> 33:39.114
- By stealing other people's hormones?
- Somehow, Aboah has managed to survive.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.923
However he's managed to survive, what
makes you think he's not an isolated case?

33:46.991 --> 33:50.427
Because of something
somebody told me last night.

33:53.064 --> 33:55.055
An African folk tale.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.492
You're basing this theory on a folk tale?

33:57.568 --> 34:00.128
lt's just another way
of describing the same truth.

34:00.204 --> 34:04.038
All new truths begin as heresies and end
as superstitions. We fear the unknown,

34:04.108 --> 34:10.069
so we reduce it to terms that are familiar,
whether that's a folk tale or a disease or

34:10.848 --> 34:12.577
a conspiracy.

34:15.253 --> 34:18.813
Even if you're right,
especially if you're right,

34:18.889 --> 34:21.222
why would he leave his country
to come here?

34:21.292 --> 34:22.884
Free cable.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.589
The same reasons anybody comes here.

34:25.663 --> 34:28.723
Liberty, the freedom
to pursue your own interests...

34:29.467 --> 34:31.458
Look at that.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.096
- What are you doing?
- lt's a demolition site.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.469
Why are we here, Mulder?

34:37.975 --> 34:41.411
Pendrell found asbestos fibers
on Owen Sanders' body.

34:41.478 --> 34:45.574
You remove asbestos from an old building
before you tear it down.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.576
lt had to come from somewhere.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.233
Scully?

36:15.673 --> 36:17.004
Scully!

36:19.577 --> 36:20.908
Mulder?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.051
Mulder?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.084
Mulder?

38:56.033 --> 38:57.466
Mulder!

39:04.108 --> 39:06.474
Mulder, are you OK?

39:42.646 --> 39:46.275
lt's OK, Mulder. l'm here. OK?

40:21.786 --> 40:23.777
Sorry, Mulder.

40:39.503 --> 40:40.561
911. Operator.

40:40.638 --> 40:45.974
This is Agent Dana Scully, FBl, requesting
immediate EMS and police assistance.

40:46.043 --> 40:49.979
- l'm in Liberty Plaza.
- May l have your badge number?

40:50.381 --> 40:52.440
My badge number?

40:52.516 --> 40:55.212
JTT0331613.

41:02.159 --> 41:03.285
No.

41:04.929 --> 41:08.990
Liberty Plaza. There's a demolition site
on the north side of the street.

41:37.895 --> 41:42.594
Special Agent Dana Scully,
field journal entry number 7 4.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.602
Despite acute trauma to his pituitary gland,

41:46.670 --> 41:51.869
Marcus Duff was discharged early this
morning from Mount Zion Medical Center.

41:52.510 --> 41:58.107
He is expected to testify before a grand jury
in the capital case against Samuel Aboah,

41:58.182 --> 42:01.515
who is being charged
with five counts of murder.

42:02.119 --> 42:04.383
lt remains uncertain, however,

42:04.455 --> 42:07.754
whether Aboah will live
long enough to stand trial.

42:07.825 --> 42:11.056
His response to hormone therapy
has been poor,

42:11.128 --> 42:14.097
his deterioration progressive.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.729
My conviction remains intact:

42:16.800 --> 42:20.759
that the mechanism by which
Aboah killed and, in turn, survived

42:20.838 --> 42:23.773
can only be explained by medical science.

42:23.841 --> 42:29.711
And that science will eventually discover
his place in the broader context of evolution.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.608
But what science
may never be able to explain

42:33.684 --> 42:37.051
is our ineffable fear of the alien among us.

42:37.421 --> 42:41.687
A fear which often drives us
not to search for understanding,

42:41.759 --> 42:45.195
but to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.

42:46.096 --> 42:49.588
To obscure the truth, not only from others,

42:49.667 --> 42:51.658
but from ourselves.
