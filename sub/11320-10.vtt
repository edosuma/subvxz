WEBVTT

02:48.751 --> 02:50.545
Why do you want to go so soon?

02:51.170 --> 02:52.797
Can we stay another day?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.342
Can't we stay another day?

02:56.426 --> 02:57.468
We can't.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.680
Here.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.724
Good.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.062
-Grandma.
-Hi. Did you sleep well?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.731
Good morning.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.815
Good morning.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.318
Did Eun-seong keep you up?

03:13.401 --> 03:15.653
No, not at all.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.738
It was nice.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.282
I got to experience what it feels like

03:19.365 --> 03:21.659
to sleep with a granddaughter.

03:23.786 --> 03:24.787
I'm...

03:25.330 --> 03:26.623
I'm sorry,

03:28.708 --> 03:30.418
but we'll be leaving first.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.879
I have something urgent to take care of.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.215
Go ahead.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.386
Yes. Good thinking.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.138
You should go.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.309
I was going to tell you to go
after breakfast anyway.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.104
About the surgery...

03:52.315 --> 03:53.441
Please do it.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.902
Please.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.238
If you wait too long,

03:59.948 --> 04:01.699
I may not be able to do it for you.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.994
I won't get surgery.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.248
I guess he didn't tell you yet.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.626
Let's stop talking about it.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.800
Thank you for everything.

04:19.968 --> 04:20.969
Also,

04:21.803 --> 04:23.429
be strong and live a good life.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.432
Don't let yourself get caught
in situations like this ever again.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.101
Have a fun

04:28.851 --> 04:30.561
and happy life.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.691
Raise your child well.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.026
Meet a nice guy

04:37.944 --> 04:39.153
and get married too.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.197
Okay?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.163
You should go. You'll miss your boat.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.040
We'll get going now.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.210
Eun-seong.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.004
Goodbye.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.922
Goodbye.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.842
Goodbye.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.519
-How much is it?
-It's 10,500 won,

05:11.602 --> 05:12.729
but just give me 10,000 won.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.105
Thank you.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.189
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.371
You should go

05:30.455 --> 05:32.081
before your dad flips out.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.710
The caregiver will be here soon.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.920
Don't worry about me,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.423
and look out for yourself.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.724
This is unlike you.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.226
You even bought food for the kid.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.479
How do you feel?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.189
I feel fine.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.860
I feel like I've been healed
ever since I came here.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.075
Finish things up well for her.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.579
Don't get too attached.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.457
It'll only hurt.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.667
I don't get attached.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.754
Are they still asleep?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.382
They left already. She said she had
something urgent to take care of.

06:23.841 --> 06:24.717
When?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.844
Right after you left.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.014
The boat is leaving.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.785
Ladies and gentlemen,
the following is an announcement.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.830
Please follow our safety instructions,

06:53.913 --> 06:56.833
and please keep your belongings
in the storage section.

07:59.979 --> 08:06.986
ONLY EMPLOYEES ALLOWED

08:32.345 --> 08:33.596
When did you get back?

08:36.599 --> 08:37.850
The kittens must have been hungry.

08:40.728 --> 08:41.729
Have you seen them?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.273
Blackie, Cutie, and Chubby?

09:11.842 --> 09:12.969
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.179
This way, please.

09:15.930 --> 09:16.931
Okay.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.812
The tumor has grown.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.606
Did you have any symptoms
other than migraines?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.149
Did your hands shake?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.193
I think so.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.113
Why did you run away last time?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.365
You can't delay your treatment.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.201
The tumor keeps pressing on the nerves,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.328
so the symptoms will worsen.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.622
Did you not bring your guardian?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.708
Doctor,

09:45.126 --> 09:47.461
what is my chance of survival?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.092
To be honest,

09:53.217 --> 09:56.887
you have about a 30 percent chance
of living for 5 years.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.182
Let's start your treatment

10:00.891 --> 10:03.352
and try to prevent the tumor from growing.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.023
Doctor.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.693
I'll be diligent with my treatment.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.446
I'll do everything you say.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.741
Please let me live. You'll save me, right?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.334
Once your treatment schedule is set,

10:26.417 --> 10:30.338
you need to come four times a week
for six weeks.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.883
Each treatment won't take long,
but it may be tiring.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.428
Do you know how much it'll cost?

10:37.553 --> 10:39.096
After insurance, it should be

10:39.180 --> 10:41.932
-about 300,000 won per session.
-Thank you.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.560
You should talk to the doctor after that.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.020
MEDICAL CENTER PHARMACY

10:50.775 --> 10:52.318
MR. HAN

10:52.443 --> 10:53.444
Where are you?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.749
Everyone, come here.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.378
-I want to go first.
-All right.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.546
-I'll go over there.
-Hey.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.257
Good job.

11:19.929 --> 11:20.930
Mom.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.521
Oh my goodness.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.149
I missed you so much.

11:32.691 --> 11:35.319
That hurts. I can't breathe.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.530
-Mom.
-I missed you.

11:37.738 --> 11:38.864
Come here.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.534
I missed you.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.538
-I missed you.
-Mom.

11:47.706 --> 11:48.833
Didn't you miss me?

11:48.916 --> 11:50.376
-I did.
-You did?

11:50.459 --> 11:51.460
How much?

11:52.086 --> 11:53.087
That much?

12:01.178 --> 12:03.097
That hurts.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.473
That hurts.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.892
No. I don't want to let go.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.853
-Mom.
-Yes?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.438
Do you want to hear something funny?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.564
Something funny?

12:12.064 --> 12:13.149
-Yes.
-What is it?

12:13.649 --> 12:16.318
-Today, during class,
-Yes?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.737
while the teacher was talking,

12:18.821 --> 12:21.657
Seo-yun farted loudly.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.326
Seo-yun must have been embarrassed.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.411
It was funny.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.163
Was it that funny?

12:27.329 --> 12:28.372
Yes, it was funny.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.915
Don't you think it's funny?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.335
It is so funny.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.672
What's so funny?

12:38.257 --> 12:40.259
Mister!

12:40.968 --> 12:42.511
Tell me the funny story too.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.221
It's a secret.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.184
Eun-seong, do you want to go ride a bike?

12:48.309 --> 12:49.310
Yes.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.479
Let's go.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.234
Mom.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.153
Come have some, Eun-seong.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.575
Here you go.

13:05.117 --> 13:05.951
Here.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.662
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.289
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.135
Did you have to leave first?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.095
I had something urgent to take care of.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.349
What was it?

13:29.725 --> 13:30.976
Why didn't you answer your phone?

13:35.231 --> 13:37.358
Let's meet later. I need to talk to you.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.318
No.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.861
I have nothing to say.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.448
What happened yesterday was a mistake.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.702
We'll get going now.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.579
I'll contact you later.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.581
Please give me the bag.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.005
It wasn't a mistake for me.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.471
I know it wasn't a mistake for you either.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.891
Let's just give it a try.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.233
Mom.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.360
Eun-seong.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.906
Mister, I'm hungry.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.616
Should we go eat?

14:28.450 --> 14:29.451
What do you want?

14:30.703 --> 14:31.704
Pork cutlet.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.581
I was craving that too.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.082
We must be telepathic.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.542
Here.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.129
Let's go.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.683
Eun-seong, be careful.

14:52.808 --> 14:53.809
Don't worry.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.647
-Mom.
-Yes?

14:58.731 --> 14:59.940
Why aren't you eating?

15:00.357 --> 15:01.358
I'm eating.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.402
Mister,

15:03.652 --> 15:04.653
where's Grandma?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.697
Did she come back with you?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.491
No. I came alone.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.452
Grandma must be bored.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.913
Will you call her often?

15:14.371 --> 15:15.414
May I?

15:15.539 --> 15:16.540
Of course.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.170
Are you okay?

15:21.712 --> 15:22.755
Eat slowly.

15:27.635 --> 15:28.969
Eat up.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.305
You eat less than your child.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.683
He's right. You eat less than I do.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.061
That's why you're so skinny.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.437
She's skinnier than this.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.730
Right?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.367
Your card is declined.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.664
-Use this then.
-Okay.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.211
This one, too.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.048
Is your system not working?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.341
My cards should be working.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.885
You don't have money, do you?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.345
I do.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.056
I'll pay. How much is it?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.349
It's 23,000 won.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.643
-Here.
-Thank you.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.228
-Eun-seong, let's go.
-Okay.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.231
I'm sure it's broken.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.191
It was working just a minute ago.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.318
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.446
Let's get some tea.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.116
No, I'm busy.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.494
May I take some time off?

16:36.745 --> 16:37.746
Time off?

16:37.913 --> 16:40.249
I'm supposed to be sent away
on a project anyway,

16:40.374 --> 16:41.917
so I'll stay at my friend's house.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.461
I'll go back to work
once the project period is over.

16:45.629 --> 16:46.797
Let's go, Eun-seong.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.428
Bye.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.814
Here you go.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.232
Thank you.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.569
It says your card has been suspended.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.529
Suspended?

17:12.364 --> 17:13.365
Try it again.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.785
Your car is so cool.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.373
It has been suspended.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.553
Did you say your final goodbye?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.140
Did you suspend

17:38.682 --> 17:39.767
my credit cards?

17:40.142 --> 17:42.811
You should've checked in right away
when you got back. Where have you been?

17:43.353 --> 17:44.938
Did you start another business
or something?

17:47.941 --> 17:49.068
My credit cards.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.445
Yes. I did it.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.490
Attorney Oh is an expert
on matters like that.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.576
All of your bank accounts
and credit cards are suspended.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.578
I requested help from the prosecutor.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.372
I filed charges against that girl
for fraud

18:02.456 --> 18:04.208
in case she comes after you.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.002
I took some precautions
to prevent any trouble.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.130
-You should be grateful.
-Dad.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.716
How much more must she con you
before you come to your senses?

18:13.008 --> 18:14.635
Why did you bring her to see your mom?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.470
Wake up, you fool.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.640
The only thing that girl wants
from you is money.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.518
Do you know how much she begged me
for money that day

18:22.601 --> 18:24.311
as she clung to my leg?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.646
She's not like that.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.689
You've lost your mind.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.983
Do you want to make a bet

18:30.526 --> 18:32.152
on whether or not she is?

18:32.236 --> 18:33.237
Dad.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.364
A man should keep his word.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.242
You promised to divorce her
as soon as you got back.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.576
Did you forget?

18:40.994 --> 18:42.121
Get a divorce.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.332
Divorce her right away.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.708
I'm sorry, Dad.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.803
I don't think

18:58.637 --> 18:59.888
I can give her up.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.016
Whatever punishment you give me,

19:04.017 --> 19:04.977
I'll gladly accept it.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.228
Why you...

19:11.650 --> 19:13.193
Take care of yourself.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.457
What did you say to Dad?

19:31.628 --> 19:32.629
You punk.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.715
How dare you ignore me?

19:34.798 --> 19:36.425
If you're that curious, ask him yourself.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.358
Dig into Ji-hun.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.694
Find every dirty secret.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.614
Tax evasion, traffic violations,
women problems, everything.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.991
I don't have time, so move quickly.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.132
Let's meet.

20:17.674 --> 20:18.884
Let's talk in person.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.259
MR. HAN

21:04.680 --> 21:05.681
Is she sleeping?

21:06.348 --> 21:09.059
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.783
Who keeps calling?

21:25.659 --> 21:26.660
A telemarketer.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.331
Was it that man?

21:32.165 --> 21:33.166
Who?

21:33.917 --> 21:35.085
Tell me the truth.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.006
Did something happen

21:40.424 --> 21:42.509
with that man on the island?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.680
I'm just kidding.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.682
Don't take it so seriously.

21:51.018 --> 21:51.977
But...

21:53.020 --> 21:54.604
I'm curious about something.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.524
Will he give you the money

21:58.191 --> 21:59.651
even though you didn't get the surgery?

22:02.112 --> 22:03.113
Yes.

22:03.947 --> 22:04.948
Really?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.784
That's great.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.872
I guess that man isn't a total jerk.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.124
He's sticking to his part
of the agreement.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.001
How much?

22:16.793 --> 22:19.087
Is it enough to open a snack shop?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.132
Yes.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.216
Really?

22:23.967 --> 22:27.179
You totally struck gold.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.181
My bad. Sorry.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.975
Was that a bit crude?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.727
Anyway,

22:34.061 --> 22:36.271
you won't have any problems

22:36.480 --> 22:38.482
with raising Eun-seong, right?

22:41.359 --> 22:42.861
What's wrong?

22:43.278 --> 22:47.157
You've always wished for a small
snack shop to run with Eun-seong.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.993
You got your wish, Hye-su.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.620
I did.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.538
I got my wish.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.419
That's so great.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.436
I heard your mom is sick.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.897
Your dad told me.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.442
I wanted to check for myself

23:23.777 --> 23:25.028
because I couldn't believe it.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.697
To be honest,

23:28.573 --> 23:31.076
she's lied about things like that before.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.453
Is she really sick?

23:35.872 --> 23:36.998
How bad is it?

23:40.210 --> 23:41.211
Forget it.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.921
Why do I bother asking you?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.132
You have no respect for me.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.259
Why would you tell me?

23:47.843 --> 23:48.844
Mom.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.929
I'm honored to hear you call me that.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.473
You know,

23:53.682 --> 23:55.767
you've hurt my feelings many times.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.603
You know that, don't you?

23:59.980 --> 24:01.314
I'm the one who raised you.

24:03.191 --> 24:06.153
I took in a child with nowhere to go
and did my best to raise him,

24:07.487 --> 24:09.239
but he's showing his gratefulness
to somebody else.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.200
What did she do for you
that you care so much?

24:14.202 --> 24:16.288
Let me make myself clear.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.583
Don't look down on me.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.543
Also,

24:21.960 --> 24:24.754
don't look down on your brother either.

24:26.673 --> 24:27.799
I know

24:28.425 --> 24:30.927
you secretly look down on Jeong-hun.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.470
I do not.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.055
I know you do.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.684
After attacking your brother
for no reason,

24:38.602 --> 24:40.103
how could you say you don't?

24:42.647 --> 24:43.899
I'll be the bigger person

24:44.733 --> 24:46.526
and forget what happened with Na-yoon.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.905
Your dad's business is on the line,

24:50.614 --> 24:52.282
so I'll let it slide.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.159
However,

24:56.203 --> 24:58.038
you need to promise me something.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.957
I will take no more.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.127
Jeong-hun is the eldest son.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.588
Let's make that clear.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.840
I raised you.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.509
That was enough to ask this of you.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.387
Don't try to take

25:15.555 --> 25:16.640
your brother's position.

25:18.558 --> 25:19.684
Also,

25:20.477 --> 25:22.103
go and tell the woman

25:23.855 --> 25:25.440
who gave birth to you

25:27.359 --> 25:29.027
that this is what she gets

25:29.486 --> 25:30.737
for making others suffer.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.507
Gosh.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.319
Let me know if you need anything.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.904
I'll bring them with me.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.614
Don't come here.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.075
Don't worry about me.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.910
Stop calling me.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.328
Fine.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.955
I won't call,

26:22.497 --> 26:24.499
so don't cause trouble,
and take care of yourself.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.209
I'll see you this weekend.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.203
You sent your son away,

27:02.662 --> 27:04.122
and you're acting all pathetic here.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.458
Go back to Seoul.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.129
-Where are you going?
-Why do you care

27:11.212 --> 27:12.505
where I go?

27:13.214 --> 27:14.215
Let me join you.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.177
I wanted to take a walk anyway.
Perfect timing.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.263
Do you still not get it?

27:21.056 --> 27:22.140
Why would I go with you?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.145
Go back to Seoul.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.982
What happened to your wife isn't my fault.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.277
You still think it's my fault,

27:34.694 --> 27:36.029
but you're to blame too.

27:36.404 --> 27:39.074
You always left her behind
and went out on the boat.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.159
You can't

27:41.409 --> 27:43.661
blame me for not lending you money.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.206
Did you come here to upset me?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.291
It's my last time,

27:49.167 --> 27:50.960
so I need to set the record straight.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.671
You crazy woman.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.049
Go back right now.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.927
I said I'm not leaving.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.929
Just let me be.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.722
Have pity on me.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.309
Have pity on you? For what?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.561
Who told you to live like that?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.357
You turned your back on your entire family

28:12.440 --> 28:14.776
because you were in love
with a married man.

28:14.859 --> 28:15.819
Why should I pity you?

28:18.613 --> 28:20.365
You're right.

28:20.448 --> 28:21.783
You are.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.993
But still, don't tell me to go.

28:24.828 --> 28:25.954
I, Oh Mi-ran,

28:26.746 --> 28:28.206
am going to die here

28:28.623 --> 28:30.333
next to Mom and Dad.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.460
What? Oh Mi-ran?

28:32.710 --> 28:33.837
You're Oh Gap-sun.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.714
You are ridiculous.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.217
Changing your name doesn't
make you a city girl.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.219
Also,

28:41.761 --> 28:43.054
stop speaking with the Seoul accent.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.014
It's annoying.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.143
Whatever.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.311
I'm going to keep speaking
with the Seoul accent.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.983
Ji-hun, come and take your mom.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.068
Why are you calling him?

28:58.027 --> 28:59.821
Don't bother him.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.823
Must I bury you too?

29:03.032 --> 29:06.536
Even if it's a cruddy life,
living is still better than dying.

29:07.829 --> 29:10.540
Stop acting tough.
Go back and get your surgery.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.461
I'm sorry, Jin-man.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.382
Please just think of me
as an annoying neighbor.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.177
Please let me stay here.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.514
Jin-man.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.224
Jin-man.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.101
I'm sorry, Jin-man.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.312
I'm so sorry about everything.

29:32.687 --> 29:33.688
Jin-man.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.231
Please...

29:37.275 --> 29:38.943
Jin-man.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.821
Jin-man, I'm so sorry.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.033
Jin-man!

29:45.784 --> 29:47.952
Jin-man, I'm sorry.

29:49.078 --> 29:52.165
I'm sorry about everything,

29:52.332 --> 29:53.416
Jin-man.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.253
Jin-man!

29:58.505 --> 30:00.507
-Let's go.
-This way, Bo-ra.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.175
Look at Mom.

30:02.258 --> 30:03.510
-Look here.
-She's taking a picture.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.470
One, two, three.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.223
You're so good.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.226
-You really are.
-Come this way.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.977
You have

30:13.102 --> 30:15.313
about a 30 percent chance
of living for 5 years.

30:16.439 --> 30:17.440
Five years.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.068
Eun-seong will be 12.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.821
Four years.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.406
Eun-seong will be 11.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.409
Three years.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.538
She'll be ten.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.834
Ten years old.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.756
Ten years old.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.634
Go over there. Let's take a picture.

30:44.717 --> 30:45.677
Let's do that.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.762
One, two, three.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.683
Would you please take a picture of us?

30:51.766 --> 30:52.934
-Sure.
-Thank you.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.864
Hello?

31:06.114 --> 31:07.532
This is Ji-hun's dad.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.380
What do you want from my son

31:22.839 --> 31:25.133
that you're still hanging around him?

31:26.384 --> 31:29.095
-No, I--
-Do you not remember what I told you?

31:29.971 --> 31:31.973
How are you so brazen?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.766
What do you take me for?

31:34.726 --> 31:37.604
The surgery was canceled,
so you should disappear.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.689
What more do you want from him?

31:40.565 --> 31:42.609
He can't do anything for you.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.444
I cut off his funding,

31:44.736 --> 31:46.487
so he can't do what you want.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.364
Don't waste your time,

31:48.865 --> 31:49.991
and back off.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.912
I sent you the divorce papers,
so sign them.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.164
This is your last chance
and my last warning for you.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.707
Got it?

32:42.251 --> 32:43.419
Mother.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.630
I told you.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.799
She's perfectly fine.

32:51.928 --> 32:52.929
Well,

32:53.471 --> 32:54.555
he was

32:55.181 --> 32:56.808
acting all strange,

32:57.433 --> 33:00.103
so I thought you were seriously ill.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.439
He said you would be getting surgery

33:03.564 --> 33:05.066
and be hospitalized for ten days.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.275
I did not.

33:06.567 --> 33:09.737
What surgery? Seung-ju was mistaken.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.615
Also,

33:13.074 --> 33:14.492
thanks for the pumpkin porridge.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.496
Here.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.581
It's boiled red ginseng.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.502
Drink some every morning and evening.

33:25.628 --> 33:26.629
I will.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.508
I'm suddenly acting like I care, right?

33:32.719 --> 33:33.720
What a joke.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.514
I know it's funny.

33:40.059 --> 33:41.060
To be honest,

33:41.352 --> 33:44.230
I met Eun-seong without telling you.

33:44.605 --> 33:45.648
Ever since then,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.694
it's been eating away at me.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.363
It's not even your fault

33:52.864 --> 33:54.115
that Seok-hwan died.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.746
But still, I hated you so much back then.

34:00.163 --> 34:03.374
I felt like he wouldn't have died so young
if he hadn't met you.

34:03.708 --> 34:07.253
I just wanted to believe
that you killed my son.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.964
But seeing Eun-seong...

34:10.965 --> 34:13.634
After seeing how well you raised her,

34:14.385 --> 34:17.805
I felt like I'd be punished
if I kept it up

34:18.514 --> 34:22.393
and that Seok-hwan must resent me
from up above.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.564
I'm sorry.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.192
It was just too hard for me.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.446
It was too hard just to make a living,

34:34.489 --> 34:35.698
so I took it out on you.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.367
People become that way

34:40.119 --> 34:41.329
when they feel cornered.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.582
Don't be sick,

34:45.291 --> 34:46.876
and live a long, happy life

34:47.418 --> 34:48.795
for Eun-seong's sake.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.924
You need to eat well
even if you don't have an appetite.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.675
Take your tonic.

34:55.384 --> 34:56.385
Be diligent.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.596
That's how you need to live.

34:59.555 --> 35:00.681
A mom with a child

35:01.224 --> 35:02.517
can't ever get sick.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.686
Thank you.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.772
Thank you.

35:10.691 --> 35:11.692
So...

35:14.445 --> 35:15.988
How's your boyfriend?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.324
Is he good to you?

35:20.451 --> 35:21.452
Yes.

35:23.913 --> 35:24.914
Good.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.374
I'm glad.

35:26.582 --> 35:27.583
I really am.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.137
Why was Hye-su suddenly sent out of town?

35:39.220 --> 35:41.139
I don't have any other good workers.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.141
That lady isn't a good worker.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.768
There are plenty of chefs
who can do what she does.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.896
I hope she never comes back.

35:49.355 --> 35:52.775
Why are you always picking on her?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.862
-Gosh.
-What did I do wrong?

35:56.362 --> 35:57.363
You always pick on me.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.870
Something is definitely up.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.455
You must be exhausted, Chef.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.958
What's going on
between Mr. Han and Hye-su?

36:09.041 --> 36:10.376
-What?
-Are they dating?

36:11.711 --> 36:12.795
Gosh.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.214
-What are you talking about?
-Hello.

36:15.715 --> 36:16.716
Hello.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.927
Speed it up. The sun is about to set.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.262
Gosh.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.433
What?

36:26.601 --> 36:27.602
Sit down.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.103
Sit.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.897
Tell me everything.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.192
-What do you mean?
-The chairman called.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.236
He said I should keep a close eye on you
in case you take the company's money.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.240
What is it? What did you do this time?

36:41.324 --> 36:42.408
I didn't do anything.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.327
Should I take a guess?

36:44.744 --> 36:47.955
This is about Hye-su, isn't it?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.626
I knew it. You punk.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.712
You're totally into her.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.797
Fine. Let's hear it.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.341
What is it?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.885
What's so great about her?

37:01.093 --> 37:02.553
Why do I need a reason to like her?

37:03.054 --> 37:05.139
-I just do.
-My goodness.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.766
What about her?

37:07.433 --> 37:08.768
Does she feel the same?

37:11.979 --> 37:12.980
Yes.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.442
Gosh, she audacious.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.568
Why you...

37:17.693 --> 37:18.986
Don't call her that.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.613
What?

37:21.155 --> 37:23.491
Anyway, what do you plan to do?

37:24.033 --> 37:26.452
Your dad won't let this slide.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.329
You might lose everything you have

37:28.412 --> 37:29.914
and get kicked out.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.624
He's already begun.

37:32.708 --> 37:33.709
Hey,

37:34.126 --> 37:35.711
I heard he suspended your credit cards.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.421
Why would I get kicked out?

37:38.673 --> 37:39.674
Even if that happens,

37:41.175 --> 37:42.551
there's nothing I can do.

37:42.718 --> 37:45.179
What an immature thing to say.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.932
You've got some guts.

37:48.015 --> 37:49.934
Do you think someone like you could last

37:50.017 --> 37:52.061
even a day if you were destitute?

37:52.311 --> 37:53.437
Do you hate me?

37:54.855 --> 37:55.856
Come on.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.776
I'm saying this for your sake.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.361
HANNAM FOOD

38:00.486 --> 38:01.570
Gosh.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.031
-Hello.
-Hello.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.909
Do you know how tough people's lives are?

38:07.201 --> 38:10.621
Do you know how many people applied
to become an entry-level employee here?

38:10.788 --> 38:13.207
We had 45 applicants. That many.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.959
Look.

38:17.211 --> 38:20.339
They're fighting to get a position
that pays only a million won per month.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.008
Some of them even studied abroad.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.136
That's reality, Ji-hun.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.638
I guarantee that you will not be

38:27.763 --> 38:29.557
able to survive on a million won.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.935
You shouldn't say things
like you'll throw everything away.

38:33.894 --> 38:34.895
Then again,

38:35.187 --> 38:37.940
I envy you for having something
you can throw away.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.116
Hey,

38:47.491 --> 38:49.577
if I could be reborn,

38:50.161 --> 38:51.912
I would want to be you.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.080
Let's swap.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.208
That way, you won't say
such immature things.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.214
Don't hurt Hye-su,

39:02.673 --> 39:04.258
and just end it here.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.857
Who texted you?

39:20.149 --> 39:21.150
What?

39:21.359 --> 39:23.736
I miss you. Please call me.

39:23.986 --> 39:25.071
It's nothing.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.239
Let's wash up for bed.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.449
Mom,

39:29.283 --> 39:30.618
when are we going home?

39:30.701 --> 39:32.620
What? We will go soon.

39:32.828 --> 39:34.288
Can't we go now?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.957
I need to feed the kittens.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.544
They must be so hungry.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.257
I'm sure Mister fed them.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.009
Still.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.303
Still, let's go.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.722
No. It's too late tonight.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.892
No. I want to go.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.686
If you won't go,
I'll ask Auntie Ju-yeon to take me.

39:58.521 --> 39:59.647
Eun-seong.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.190
Eun-seong.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.650
I'm losing it.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.324
Why do I miss her so much?

40:20.209 --> 40:21.460
Let's hurry.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.135
What are you doing?

40:30.719 --> 40:32.012
-Let's go in.
-What?

40:33.973 --> 40:34.974
Eun-seong.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.600
Don't run.

40:38.310 --> 40:39.603
Okay.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.688
There it is.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.571
See? He fed them. Let's go.

40:48.654 --> 40:49.655
Hold on.

40:49.864 --> 40:50.906
Hold on, Mom.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.159
Let me play with them for a minute.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.579
Please?

40:57.163 --> 40:58.164
Okay.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.641
Mister.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.103
He's sleeping.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.188
Let's go home.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.774
Let's go.

43:13.465 --> 43:16.010
-What's the rush?
-Don't you want to go to nursery tomorrow?

43:16.385 --> 43:19.305
I do, but let's walk slowly.

43:20.931 --> 43:21.932
Hello.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.517
Are you going somewhere?

43:23.684 --> 43:25.936
Yes, we need to go somewhere. Goodbye.

43:26.353 --> 43:27.354
Let's go.

43:43.203 --> 43:44.330
Are you looking for someone?

43:46.957 --> 43:48.334
What brings you here at this hour?

43:56.925 --> 43:58.552
May I ask what happened?

44:00.888 --> 44:01.889
What?

44:09.647 --> 44:11.023
What is your relationship with her?

44:13.025 --> 44:14.193
Never mind, don't tell me.

44:15.152 --> 44:16.737
I won't ask. Don't say anything.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.406
-Na-yoon.
-Ji-hun.

44:20.199 --> 44:21.784
Do you know how I feel right now?

44:22.576 --> 44:24.036
It's hard and painful.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.205
I went through a lot

44:26.705 --> 44:29.958
and endured humiliation to be with you.
You know that, right?

44:31.043 --> 44:33.587
-I'm sorry.
-That makes me feel worse.

44:52.898 --> 44:54.608
I'm sorry about your mom.

44:57.486 --> 44:59.988
I had no idea you were
going through so much pain.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.615
I didn't know,

45:02.491 --> 45:04.451
and I'm sorry
for forcing my emotions on you.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.495
But Ji-hun,

45:07.579 --> 45:09.415
it's time to go back.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.917
You know that, right?

45:15.796 --> 45:17.339
You wavered. I understand.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.925
In desperate times, it's only natural

45:20.551 --> 45:21.927
for you to get weak.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.304
I feel bad for her too.

45:26.181 --> 45:28.016
I don't know what led her here,

45:28.976 --> 45:31.019
but I'm sure she wanted to rely on you.

45:33.272 --> 45:34.273
I understand everything.

45:35.899 --> 45:37.025
Na-yoon.

45:37.860 --> 45:38.861
Yes?

45:41.029 --> 45:42.197
Forget me.

45:44.700 --> 45:47.494
I was a jerk then,
and I'm still a jerk now.

45:49.329 --> 45:50.914
Just curse me out and move on.

45:52.958 --> 45:54.585
I'll always be a selfish coward.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.589
I just can't be with you.

46:01.508 --> 46:02.509
I'm sorry.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.116
-Mom.
-Yes?

46:26.575 --> 46:28.035
Did you fight with Mister?

46:30.621 --> 46:31.622
Yes.

46:32.372 --> 46:33.415
We fought.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.250
Why did you fight?

46:37.252 --> 46:38.295
I don't know.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.547
Why did we fight?

46:43.008 --> 46:46.261
Don't fight. Get along with him, okay?

46:48.847 --> 46:49.848
Okay.

46:51.308 --> 46:52.684
We'll get along.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.687
Promise me.

47:02.444 --> 47:03.445
All done.

47:04.613 --> 47:05.614
Let's go.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.108
I'm not done yet though.

48:25.193 --> 48:26.361
Eun-seong...

48:27.487 --> 48:28.614
is already asleep.

48:34.828 --> 48:36.538
What's with the makeup this late at night?

48:37.122 --> 48:38.457
Because it's spring.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.084
I just felt

48:41.376 --> 48:42.502
like putting it on.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.422
You're being suspicious.

48:46.506 --> 48:47.716
Where are you going at this hour?

48:47.799 --> 48:49.301
I'm not going anywhere.

48:50.552 --> 48:51.553
Do I look pretty?

48:52.429 --> 48:53.764
Yes. So pretty.

48:55.682 --> 48:58.435
Gosh, Hye-su.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.229
You look so good just like the old days.

49:02.481 --> 49:04.941
When we were in school,

49:05.233 --> 49:06.485
you looked pretty decent.

49:08.403 --> 49:09.488
You aged so much.

49:09.738 --> 49:11.365
I can't bear to look.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.033
Hey.

49:14.993 --> 49:16.036
Punk.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.581
-Ju-yeon.
-Yes?

49:20.165 --> 49:21.166
Do my nails for me.

49:21.458 --> 49:22.334
Your nails?

49:22.417 --> 49:25.212
You said you can't do your nails because
you always have to wash things at work.

49:25.295 --> 49:26.338
Whatever.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.551
I want the most popular color

49:31.677 --> 49:33.679
and add something shiny.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.057
What has gotten into you today?

49:38.308 --> 49:39.309
Okay.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.394
Ma'am,

49:40.727 --> 49:41.895
what's wrong with your hands?

49:43.355 --> 49:46.566
Just looking at your hands,
you look like an old lady.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.736
Oh my gosh. You are so skinny,

49:50.237 --> 49:51.780
and your hands are all dry.

49:52.447 --> 49:55.617
This will cost more. Is that all right?

49:56.034 --> 49:56.993
Gosh.

49:57.536 --> 49:59.871
Why didn't you do this for me before?

49:59.996 --> 50:02.791
Gosh, that's why I'm doing it now.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.334
How's this?

50:24.896 --> 50:26.773
I know it wasn't a mistake for you either.

50:28.817 --> 50:30.318
Let's just give it a try.

50:34.656 --> 50:35.657
What do you think?

50:44.958 --> 50:45.959
Gosh.

50:47.586 --> 50:48.587
It's so cool.

50:54.342 --> 50:55.343
Are you crying?

50:56.344 --> 50:57.345
Why are you crying?

50:58.722 --> 51:00.557
You're pretty good.

51:01.892 --> 51:03.059
It's so pretty.

51:03.143 --> 51:06.229
Then you should smile, not cry.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.150
Ju-yeon.

51:11.067 --> 51:12.068
Yes?

51:13.361 --> 51:14.780
Do you think there will be

51:16.156 --> 51:17.574
a shining moment in my life...

51:18.784 --> 51:20.702
at least once?

51:24.998 --> 51:26.374
Do you think...

51:29.503 --> 51:31.963
there will come a day...

51:35.592 --> 51:38.178
when it will shine like these nails?

51:38.970 --> 51:40.138
Of course.

51:41.389 --> 51:43.225
You're still young.

51:43.308 --> 51:45.352
Don't be discouraged
just because you have a kid.

51:45.519 --> 51:47.979
Your life is on the fast lane now.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.690
You paid off your debt.

51:50.899 --> 51:52.526
You didn't get the surgery.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.735
You're getting money.

51:54.402 --> 51:57.155
It couldn't be any better. Okay?

52:08.708 --> 52:11.670
Come on. What's wrong?

52:12.045 --> 52:13.046
What is it?

52:13.296 --> 52:14.631
I'm crying because it's such a shame.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.383
All right?

52:17.384 --> 52:18.552
It's such a shame.

52:20.011 --> 52:22.347
Gosh, it's such a waste.

52:22.889 --> 52:24.850
There's so much I want to do.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.815
I want to date.

52:33.817 --> 52:34.943
I...

52:35.777 --> 52:36.945
want to kiss a guy.

52:37.904 --> 52:40.323
I want to dress up and go out.

52:40.615 --> 52:43.243
I wanted to sparkle

52:43.326 --> 52:45.328
and live a great life.

52:45.745 --> 52:47.789
Then do it.

52:49.207 --> 52:50.333
Hye-su,

52:51.251 --> 52:52.711
you can do it.

52:54.754 --> 52:56.339
My gosh.

52:57.048 --> 52:59.467
You messed up your pretty nails.

53:02.804 --> 53:04.764
What did I do that was so wrong?

53:04.973 --> 53:05.974
Tell me.

53:06.558 --> 53:07.601
Ju-yeon, tell me.

53:10.812 --> 53:12.105
What did I do wrong?

55:11.516 --> 55:12.684
What is it?

55:13.101 --> 55:15.979
I don't have time to talk to you.

55:17.856 --> 55:19.149
Just cut to the chase.

55:20.608 --> 55:23.528
You haven't sent in the divorce papers.

55:24.029 --> 55:25.113
I'll get the divorce.

55:25.613 --> 55:27.365
Of course you should.

55:27.449 --> 55:28.950
Why bother telling me?

55:29.576 --> 55:30.577
In return,

55:30.994 --> 55:32.120
give me money.

55:33.371 --> 55:36.875
You should pay me the rest of the balance.

55:39.085 --> 55:40.795
I need that money.

55:42.255 --> 55:43.256
If you give me the money,

55:44.132 --> 55:45.133
I'll leave him.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.303
And if I don't,

55:48.970 --> 55:50.430
you won't leave him?

55:52.057 --> 55:53.099
That's correct.

56:07.989 --> 56:09.115
Let's meet today.

56:09.949 --> 56:11.326
Otherwise, I'll come to you.

56:21.002 --> 56:23.088
SEND

56:27.133 --> 56:28.259
Check if it's correct.

56:33.181 --> 56:34.182
It is.

56:35.475 --> 56:36.476
Here.

56:36.976 --> 56:38.061
I'll get going now.

56:46.736 --> 56:48.696
Hey, what did you...

56:49.364 --> 56:50.740
Did you sell your car?

56:51.282 --> 56:52.992
-I put it up as collateral.
-What?

56:53.451 --> 56:54.869
You used the car to get a loan?

56:54.953 --> 56:56.496
Oh my, you've really...

56:56.996 --> 56:57.872
My gosh.

57:05.004 --> 57:07.173
Please wait here. I'll go appraise it.

57:07.465 --> 57:08.466
Sure.

57:30.196 --> 57:31.197
I saved this

57:31.823 --> 57:34.325
for my wedding fund.

57:34.409 --> 57:35.535
You know that, right?

57:35.743 --> 57:36.744
I know.

57:37.495 --> 57:39.956
-I'll pay it back soon. Don't worry.
-How?

57:40.039 --> 57:41.833
You lost your car and your watch.

57:42.208 --> 57:44.335
Hye-su is so mean.

57:44.669 --> 57:47.505
-She didn't even get the surgery.
-She isn't asking for it.

57:48.089 --> 57:49.507
I just want to keep my promise.

57:50.383 --> 57:51.384
With someone else's money?

57:51.509 --> 57:53.052
I said I'll pay you back soon.

57:53.845 --> 57:55.054
How much interest will you pay?

57:56.181 --> 57:57.891
What? Interest?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.185
How much will you give me?

58:00.310 --> 58:02.395
I can't trust you anymore.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.522
Don't you dare take off with my money.

58:04.772 --> 58:05.857
I'll kill you.

58:06.107 --> 58:07.400
Gosh.

58:08.026 --> 58:09.027
Fine.

58:10.778 --> 58:12.155
I don't need interest.

58:14.824 --> 58:15.825
Thanks, Ho-jun.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.412
Sure.

58:21.122 --> 58:22.373
Punk.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.755
Where should I meet you?

58:30.673 --> 58:33.218
Ho-jun, how about a little more?

58:33.843 --> 58:35.094
What now?

58:35.178 --> 58:36.846
Book a restaurant for me.

58:38.014 --> 58:39.015
Right now?

58:39.724 --> 58:40.850
Pay for it too.

58:41.476 --> 58:42.852
My goodness.

58:45.647 --> 58:48.399
So when do you need it?

58:48.816 --> 58:50.777
-Tonight?
-Yes, tonight.

58:50.860 --> 58:53.488
DAILY HOTEL EVENT

58:54.155 --> 58:55.406
Gosh.

58:56.324 --> 58:58.159
Okay, I'll be sure to repay you.

58:58.284 --> 58:59.619
JUN DINING

58:59.744 --> 59:00.745
It's done.

59:02.664 --> 59:04.832
Hello. What are you looking for?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.711
-May I see some rings?
-Yes. Just a minute.

59:15.385 --> 59:16.427
-I'll take this one.
-Okay.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.096
-I'll wrap it up.
-Thanks.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.683
Hello.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.935
-Whose name is the reservation under?
-Han Ji-hun.

59:24.018 --> 59:25.436
I'll see you to your seat.

59:45.707 --> 59:46.833
How have you been?

59:47.166 --> 59:48.334
How have you been?

59:55.174 --> 59:56.593
We'll wait to order.

59:56.676 --> 59:57.677
Yes, sir.

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:03.141
Maybe we should've gotten tteokbokki.

1:00:10.273 --> 1:00:11.274
All right.

1:00:11.774 --> 1:00:13.192
Let's take care of business first.

1:00:20.992 --> 1:00:22.201
It's the money I promised.

1:00:23.870 --> 1:00:26.539
Our contract ended as of today.

1:00:28.207 --> 1:00:29.375
Thank you for everything.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:49.479
And this...

1:00:55.068 --> 1:00:56.194
Open it.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:16.881
Let's not

1:01:18.549 --> 1:01:20.176
get divorced. Let's go with it.

1:01:22.553 --> 1:01:24.097
Let's be brave and go for it.

1:01:24.639 --> 1:01:26.849
I'll take care of everything to come.

1:01:27.141 --> 1:01:28.142
I'll handle it.

1:01:29.185 --> 1:01:30.311
I will bear

1:01:31.813 --> 1:01:33.231
all of the burden from now on.

1:01:40.822 --> 1:01:42.615
I'm going to visit my mom this weekend.

1:01:43.157 --> 1:01:46.202
I got this for you
to make sure you won't run away.

1:01:51.624 --> 1:01:53.167
See if it fits.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:16.274
I will turn down both of these.

1:02:18.109 --> 1:02:19.235
Please divorce me.

1:02:20.528 --> 1:02:22.613
I received the money from your dad.

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:28.995
My dad?

1:02:30.413 --> 1:02:31.539
Yes.

1:02:32.248 --> 1:02:34.667
I went to him and asked for it.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:37.253
I heard

1:02:38.629 --> 1:02:39.964
you couldn't get the money.

1:02:41.132 --> 1:02:42.800
I'm sorry

1:02:43.801 --> 1:02:45.428
the surgery fell through.

1:02:46.304 --> 1:02:48.181
-Hye-su.
-I'm sorry.

1:02:49.265 --> 1:02:51.309
I was never...

1:02:52.977 --> 1:02:54.687
romantically attracted to you.

1:02:56.814 --> 1:02:59.317
I think we should each go back
to where we belong.

1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:03.988
That's absurd.

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:06.783
Do you think I'm stupid?

1:03:07.158 --> 1:03:08.826
We got caught up in our roles.

1:03:10.328 --> 1:03:11.954
I think there was a mistake.

1:03:12.622 --> 1:03:15.166
-Hye-su.
-That night was definitely a mistake.

1:03:16.709 --> 1:03:17.835
Please forget about it.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:19.587
Do you mean it?

1:03:21.297 --> 1:03:22.298
Yes.

1:03:28.596 --> 1:03:29.722
Let me ask again.

1:03:33.059 --> 1:03:34.060
Do you mean it?

1:03:37.730 --> 1:03:38.731
Yes.

1:03:41.192 --> 1:03:42.360
I mean it.

1:04:11.556 --> 1:04:13.558
