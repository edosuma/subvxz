00:48.302 --> 00:50.841
Did you feel it too, Supreme Kai?

00:50.843 --> 00:54.568
Yes, he really did wake
up quickly this time.

00:55.121 --> 00:59.616
Peace is indeed a
short-lasting thing.

00:59.618 --> 01:02.145
Yes, Supreme Kai.

01:04.462 --> 01:06.579
Yes.

01:08.449 --> 01:11.288
Yes, I felt it too.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.374
Hey Goku, be quiet a little!

01:14.376 --> 01:16.356
I'm in middle of a conversation!

01:16.358 --> 01:17.561
Goku?

01:17.563 --> 01:20.735
Is Son Goku there?

01:20.737 --> 01:22.111
Yes yes.

01:22.113 --> 01:24.728
He came to this star to train.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.891
You must not let him realise!

01:26.893 --> 01:28.849
He'll without a doubt show interest!

01:28.851 --> 01:33.067
Yes, about lord Bills...

01:33.069 --> 01:34.543
In that case...

01:38.250 --> 01:40.071
Who's lord Bills?

01:41.488 --> 01:44.307
Goku!

01:44.309 --> 01:46.139
Is it a name of a snack?

01:49.130 --> 01:53.227
You know it!
It's a very delicious snack!

01:53.229 --> 01:55.131
That can't be true.

01:55.133 --> 01:58.598
You talked in an afraid tone,
King Kai.

02:04.161 --> 02:06.690
It's something you don't need to know.

02:06.692 --> 02:09.939
If you say it like that,
it makes me more curious.

02:09.941 --> 02:11.882
I'm never going to tell you.

02:11.884 --> 02:14.105
You were talking to the
Supreme Kai, right?

02:14.107 --> 02:15.810
Should I ask him myself?

02:17.274 --> 02:21.146
Okay, fine. Just don't use
instant transmission.

02:23.207 --> 02:26.399
Don't tell the Supreme Kai
that you heard it from me.

02:28.133 --> 02:32.204
In this world, there is a god who
gives birth to stars and life.

02:32.206 --> 02:34.755
Just like the Supreme Kai.

02:34.757 --> 02:41.667
On the other hand, there is a god
who destroys stars and life.

02:42.447 --> 02:46.475
How many stars will be
destroyed this time?

02:46.477 --> 02:52.609
Lord Bills, the God of
Destruction has awoken.

02:52.611 --> 02:55.959
Looks like we won't feel
in peace for a while.

02:56.645 --> 02:58.823
Why are you in your uniform?

02:59.328 --> 03:02.567
Lord Bills should be
very strong.

03:02.569 --> 03:04.332
Oi, don't tell me...

03:04.334 --> 03:06.755
I'm curious to see how strong he is!

03:06.757 --> 03:09.035
Idiot!

03:09.037 --> 03:09.962
What's wrong?

03:09.964 --> 03:12.820
You don't know anything!

03:12.822 --> 03:16.686
Lord Bill's power is on a
completely different level!

03:16.688 --> 03:20.266
He's the world's strongest, God
of Destruction, Lord Bills!

03:20.268 --> 03:24.134
He's a god who even makes the
Supreme Kai,

03:24.136 --> 03:28.696
wet himself a little, from fear!

03:28.698 --> 03:32.533
Him being the strongest
in the world concerns me.

05:04.674 --> 05:07.744
Please open your eyes, Lord Bills.

05:09.448 --> 05:11.447
You can't sleep twice.

05:11.449 --> 05:16.717
You're the one who set up the
alarm bomb at this time.

05:16.719 --> 05:19.844
If you don't wake up quickly,
the second alarm will...

05:24.752 --> 05:28.270
I know,
I know.

05:30.137 --> 05:34.973
You can't oversleep for 15
years like you did before.

05:34.975 --> 05:37.588
If you still can't wake up,

05:38.762 --> 05:43.004
shall I sing a song to
awake you?

05:44.739 --> 05:46.059
In that case!

05:46.061 --> 05:49.871
I know, I know!

06:22.454 --> 06:26.435
I only slept 39 years this time,

06:26.437 --> 06:29.341
so it only counts as a nap.

06:29.343 --> 06:33.367
You're the one who decides the
time you wake up, Lord Bills.

06:33.369 --> 06:36.271
Anyways, why at this time?

06:36.273 --> 06:39.463
There's something concerning me.

06:42.471 --> 06:44.294
By the way, Whis.

06:44.296 --> 06:51.674
While I was sleeping, did
Frieza destroy Planet Vegeta?

06:51.676 --> 06:54.613
Yes, without a trace left.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.941
Is that so?

06:55.943 --> 07:00.254
The fools on that planent were useless
no matter how much time passed.

07:00.256 --> 07:02.777
King Vegeta was especially worse.

07:04.699 --> 07:09.881
I could have destroyed it, but
that planet is really far away.

07:09.883 --> 07:11.846
I couldn't be bothered.

07:11.848 --> 07:16.067
On another note, Frieza
is pretty bad himself.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.344
Showing off and all.

07:17.346 --> 07:20.900
Should I destroy him
the next time we meet?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.898
There is no need.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.835
Frieza is already dead.

07:27.754 --> 07:31.204
There's someone who can
kill Frieza?

07:31.206 --> 07:32.813
Please wait a moment.

07:43.044 --> 07:46.784
I think I've seen this somewhere.

07:46.786 --> 07:48.663
What is this guy?

07:48.665 --> 07:50.545
He's a Saiyan.

07:50.547 --> 07:55.110
He's called Son Goku,
otherwise known as, Kakarot.

07:58.207 --> 08:02.894
Didn't the Saiyans meet their
end alongside Planet Vegeta?

08:02.896 --> 08:04.876
Most of them did so.

08:04.878 --> 08:09.161
Luckily, the ones who were at the time
on another planet managed to survive.

08:09.163 --> 08:12.753
Just to note, Prince
Vegeta is one of them.

08:12.755 --> 08:16.622
Weren't Saiyan's hair black?

08:18.544 --> 08:22.973
Put that aside, a Saiyan
managed to win against Frieza.

08:31.981 --> 08:38.842
More recently, it seems that the Saiyans
mastered an ability to become a Super Saiyan.

08:38.844 --> 08:40.642
What's that?

08:40.644 --> 08:45.266
Super Saiyan.

08:45.268 --> 08:48.303
Super Saiyan!?

08:48.305 --> 08:49.922
Is that so.

08:49.924 --> 08:51.557
There was someone like him!

08:51.559 --> 08:52.890
What do you mean?

08:52.892 --> 08:56.371
Hmm, Super Saiyan.

08:56.373 --> 08:58.552
Super Saiyan...

08:58.554 --> 09:00.371
Super Saiyan God!

09:00.373 --> 09:02.310
I saw it in a dream!

09:02.312 --> 09:07.236
Fighting against a guy like this,
known as, Super Saiyan God!

09:08.331 --> 09:10.714
Do you still not understand?

09:10.716 --> 09:14.011
It's a precognitive dream,
a precognitive dream!

09:14.013 --> 09:15.842
A dream?

09:20.189 --> 09:25.063
Your dreams have very low cases
of accuracy, Lord Bills.

09:26.384 --> 09:32.333
Even before, you dreamt an idol
moving here, and it was wrong.

09:32.335 --> 09:33.979
Are you treating me like an idiot?

09:33.981 --> 09:37.113
Okay, follow me Whis!

09:38.192 --> 09:42.043
Oracle Fish,
Oracle Fish, are you there!?

09:52.491 --> 09:54.089
I went for a walk.

09:54.091 --> 09:55.201
What's up?

09:55.203 --> 09:58.394
You said 39 years ago that,

09:58.396 --> 10:02.576
in 39 years,
I'll face an enemy of threat.

10:04.939 --> 10:06.371
I said that?

10:06.373 --> 10:08.023
You did!

10:09.996 --> 10:11.431
Well, then let's say I did.

10:11.433 --> 10:15.387
See? The prediction made by the Oracle
Fish and my precognitive dream.

10:15.389 --> 10:18.799
It's going to appear,
a formidable enemy!

10:18.801 --> 10:21.353
The Super Saiyan God!

10:22.567 --> 10:25.217
This sure is subtle.

10:25.219 --> 10:29.310
Isn't it implausible that there would be a
formidable enemy of threat to you, Lord Bills?

10:30.463 --> 10:34.320
Well, even if the prediction that
there is a threat was to be untrue,

10:34.322 --> 10:37.069
it feels like someone
interesting will appear!

10:37.071 --> 10:40.198
That's why
I woke up early.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.766
So that was the case.

10:43.768 --> 10:47.553
So, are you going to go meet
the Saiyans?

10:47.555 --> 10:49.152
Of course.

10:49.154 --> 10:53.117
I have to find the Super Saiyan God.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.066
Super Saiyan God you say?

10:56.068 --> 10:59.045
Sounds like an exaggerated name.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.993
Feels old fashioned...

11:06.526 --> 11:10.506
I found them,
most of the alive Saiyans.

11:10.508 --> 11:14.407
Planet 4032-Green-877

11:14.409 --> 11:18.445
There seems to be around
five, on planet Earth.

11:18.447 --> 11:20.644
Earth?

11:20.646 --> 11:23.578
I've never heard of it.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.900
Except for the one Saiyan,

11:25.902 --> 11:28.203
who killed Frieza.

11:28.205 --> 11:32.190
He seems to be on the
Northern Kai's planet.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.367
A Saiyan on a Kai's territory?

11:35.369 --> 11:37.005
Suspicious.

11:38.288 --> 11:40.798
Whis,
how long will it take to get there?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.735
Approximately, 26 minutes.

11:42.737 --> 11:45.876
I'll be able to watch
1 Episode of Anime.

11:45.878 --> 11:47.765
It's far away.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.212
Can't be helped.

11:49.214 --> 11:51.091
Let us go.

11:51.093 --> 11:54.149
Then shall we?

12:08.003 --> 12:12.751
Happy Birthday Bulma!

12:21.810 --> 12:23.213
Not coming?

12:23.215 --> 12:27.389
Why is he training where King
Kai is at a time like this?

12:27.391 --> 12:29.354
He's someone who would do that.

12:29.356 --> 12:33.417
I told him since half a year ago!

12:34.972 --> 12:36.811
What about Vegeta?

12:36.813 --> 12:38.498
He seems to be training.

12:39.923 --> 12:42.675
Can't help those Saiyans!

12:49.691 --> 12:53.853
Bulma if it's your
birthday, how old are you?

12:53.855 --> 12:57.260
Rude,
do you think I'd tell you that?

12:57.262 --> 13:02.307
The prize of the bingo competition
consists of a castle and a plane, right?

13:02.309 --> 13:05.813
Yeah, if it's bothersome, you
can have it in cash instead.

13:05.815 --> 13:08.387
As expected from the world's most wealthy!

13:08.389 --> 13:12.264
Would Goku at least come
for the bingo competition?

13:12.266 --> 13:15.492
Bulma, do you have any
pornography as a prize?

13:15.494 --> 13:16.692
No!

13:18.391 --> 13:22.627
Goku, it's trouble!
Here... here...

13:22.629 --> 13:24.255
Is Bulma coming?!

13:24.257 --> 13:27.370
No, its Lord Bills!

13:27.372 --> 13:30.883
The God of Destruction, Lord
Bills, is making his way here!

13:33.309 --> 13:35.354
I can't feel anything.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.420
You guys can't feel
a god's presence.

13:38.422 --> 13:42.981
Do you understand? Avoid
any foolish actions.

13:42.983 --> 13:46.275
I said it'll be fine.

13:46.277 --> 13:48.010
Okay!

13:49.360 --> 13:51.409
This is worrying.

13:51.411 --> 13:53.951
Goku, hide inside my house!

13:53.953 --> 13:55.024
Why?

13:55.026 --> 13:57.021
Hurry!

13:57.023 --> 13:59.164
Even if you say hurry...

13:59.166 --> 14:00.225
Hurry up!

14:00.227 --> 14:01.705
Okay~

14:04.138 --> 14:08.433
Why, why is Lord Bills coming here?

14:08.435 --> 14:10.411
Why?

14:19.802 --> 14:21.438
Lord Bills,

14:21.440 --> 14:23.399
why would you...

14:23.401 --> 14:28.361
Welcome! The long travel
must have been tiring.

14:30.703 --> 14:35.673
Long time no see, Northern-Kai.

14:35.675 --> 14:41.002
Your star is very small.

14:42.565 --> 14:47.492
I apologise, it's quite the
boring and mundane star.

14:47.494 --> 14:51.697
You made it smaller by
destryoing it, Lord Bills.

14:51.699 --> 14:54.182
Because you lost at Hide and Seek.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.686
Was that so?

14:57.255 --> 15:02.584
On another note, what brings
you here, Lord Bills?

15:02.586 --> 15:06.237
I just have a business with
that Saiyan hiding over there.

15:07.160 --> 15:07.917
This is bad!

15:07.919 --> 15:09.906
Come out.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.554
I apologise for my rudeness.

15:12.556 --> 15:16.086
Goku, greet Lord Bills!

15:20.028 --> 15:22.625
Hi, I'm Goâ¦
/ Fool!

15:23.822 --> 15:25.905
I knew you'd say that!

15:25.907 --> 15:29.868
Since you're old enough,
at least greet properly.

15:31.628 --> 15:33.967
Ah, Hello.

15:33.969 --> 15:40.680
Not that...
I'm Son Goku!

15:40.682 --> 15:42.468
Nice to meet you.

15:42.470 --> 15:46.565
I would like to ask you something.

15:48.590 --> 15:49.716
about Super...

15:49.718 --> 15:52.062
Saiyan God.

15:52.064 --> 15:57.862
Yes, do you know about the
existence of Super Saiyan God?

15:57.864 --> 16:00.069
Super Saiyan God?

16:00.071 --> 16:05.820
I know what Super Saiyan is,
but I've never heard of "God."

16:08.093 --> 16:10.150
Never heard of it!

16:10.152 --> 16:16.343
I have also never heard
of this Super Saiyan God.

16:16.345 --> 16:18.317
Is that so?

16:19.285 --> 16:24.162
I heard from Whis that
you defeated Frieza?

16:24.164 --> 16:25.143
Frieza?

16:25.145 --> 16:29.620
Yes, I defeated Frieza.

16:37.235 --> 16:40.251
Seeing you now... I don't
think you'd be able to.

16:40.253 --> 16:45.229
It seems that you power up by
turning into a Super Saiyan.

16:45.231 --> 16:48.931
Yes, you know well.

16:48.933 --> 16:53.490
And you still don't know "God"?

16:55.640 --> 17:01.463
Whis, is Prince Vegeta on
Earth, a Super Saiyan as well?

17:01.465 --> 17:03.565
Yes, three others too.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.781
They all seem to be able to transform.

17:05.784 --> 17:09.207
You knew that much?

17:09.209 --> 17:13.425
They can all transform...
Seems suspicious...

17:13.426 --> 17:17.262
Would we be able to get a
clue, if we go to Earth?

17:17.263 --> 17:22.578
Lord Bills, I assume that the other
Saiyans wouldn't know as well.

17:22.579 --> 17:25.992
We'll know if we ask.

17:25.993 --> 17:28.279
Shall we go to Earth?

17:28.281 --> 17:30.735
Umm...

17:30.737 --> 17:33.777
You're not planning to destroy
it or anything, right?

17:33.779 --> 17:36.389
If there isn't anything
that annoys me.

17:36.391 --> 17:39.749
Hey you, I mean...

17:39.751 --> 17:42.884
I heard Lord Bills is
extremely powerful.

17:42.886 --> 17:46.386
Would it be too much to
ask for you to show me?

17:46.388 --> 17:48.800
You want to see my power?

17:48.802 --> 17:50.425
How?

17:50.427 --> 17:53.631
Even if it's just a little,
would you like to spar with me?

17:53.633 --> 17:55.873
Goku, enough!

17:55.875 --> 18:02.111
I've lived long but, I've
never anything like that.

18:02.113 --> 18:04.327
You have very good self-confidence.

18:04.329 --> 18:07.564
Or are you simply an idiot?

18:07.566 --> 18:09.126
Yes, He's an idiot!

18:09.128 --> 18:11.838
A simple idiot!

18:11.840 --> 18:13.592
Okay.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.390
Then fight me with your full power.

18:16.392 --> 18:20.369
Thank you... I mean

18:20.908 --> 18:24.003
But is it okay if I use
my full power at once?

18:24.005 --> 18:28.290
Even if you get hurt, please don't
get angry and destroy this star.

18:28.292 --> 18:30.050
I promise.

18:30.052 --> 18:32.550
Come at me.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.698
Ok!

18:43.640 --> 18:46.518
Firstly, this is Super Saiyan.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.664
Secondly, Super Saiyan 2!

19:04.590 --> 19:09.212
And finally, the strongest; Super Saiyan 3!

19:09.214 --> 19:11.680
Run, Bubbles!

19:13.812 --> 19:16.540
This is surprising.

19:16.542 --> 19:20.139
Seems that you weren't bluffing.

19:20.141 --> 19:21.801
Isn't that right?

19:21.803 --> 19:24.094
Should I go back to
Super Saiyan 2?

19:24.096 --> 19:27.274
No, stay like that.

19:27.276 --> 19:29.448
Let's begin.

19:29.450 --> 19:31.632
Underestimating me, okay!

20:56.014 --> 20:57.796
Here I come!

20:57.798 --> 20:59.431
Okay.

20:59.433 --> 21:02.216
See you again, Northern-Kai.

21:18.155 --> 21:23.059
Were you alive, you fool.

21:25.765 --> 21:27.772
I can't sit around like this.

21:27.774 --> 21:31.139
I have to tell Vegeta
as soon as possible.

21:45.365 --> 21:47.681
Vegeta, this is King-Kai.

21:58.729 --> 22:00.924
What does the King-Kai want with me?

22:00.926 --> 22:03.266
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to say.

22:03.268 --> 22:06.872
Not far from now, Lord Bills, the God
of Destruction will arrive on Earth.

22:06.874 --> 22:08.692
The God of Destruction?

22:08.694 --> 22:11.615
I've heard of that name.

22:11.617 --> 22:15.111
Anyways, even if
Lord Bills arrive there,

22:15.113 --> 22:18.706
never, never
lay a finger on him.

22:18.708 --> 22:23.648
If you don't listen, the entire
Earth will be destroyed!

22:23.650 --> 22:25.591
Earth, destroyed?

22:25.593 --> 22:29.052
Even Goku completely lost.

22:29.054 --> 22:31.536
What?!
Kakarot lost?!

22:31.538 --> 22:36.668
Super Saiyan 3 Goku was
defeated in two hits.

22:36.670 --> 22:40.004
Two hits...?

22:40.006 --> 22:44.549
I beg you, the fate of the
Earth depend on your hands.

22:54.353 --> 22:56.343
Amazing...

22:56.345 --> 22:59.272
That such guy exists...

22:59.274 --> 23:03.624
Was it, Super Saiyan God?

23:05.844 --> 23:08.813
He's finally here, Vegeta.

23:08.815 --> 23:13.385
Why are you wearing your training
attire on your wife's birthday?

23:13.387 --> 23:17.111
Why do you look so gloom?

23:17.113 --> 23:21.364
Are you shocked that your wife
is gaining age, yet again?

23:21.366 --> 23:25.985
You Saiyans are lucky that you don't age.

23:27.216 --> 23:28.604
Shut up!

23:31.787 --> 23:34.013
What do you mean, shut up!?

23:34.015 --> 23:36.610
What is this uneasy feeling.

23:36.612 --> 23:40.493
Am I trembling in fear?

23:40.495 --> 23:42.466
Really, what is it!

23:43.665 --> 23:45.337
God of Destruction, Bills.

23:45.339 --> 23:48.030
I'm sure I've met him before.

23:48.032 --> 23:50.647
You're Prince Vegeta, correct?

23:50.649 --> 23:53.027
You've become a fine adult.

23:53.029 --> 23:58.571
The thing you guys call "Ki"
doesn't seem to work on gods.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.713
Did you remember?

24:06.584 --> 24:08.600
I remember!

24:08.602 --> 24:13.775
The last time we met was when you
were still a child, I presume?

24:14.264 --> 24:16.089
Don't you remember?

24:16.091 --> 24:22.108
I received some generosity
from your father, King Vegeta.

24:48.033 --> 24:51.221
God of Destruction...

24:51.223 --> 24:53.201
...Lord Bills!

24:53.203 --> 24:55.899
The kai wasn't
joking around.

24:55.901 --> 24:58.666
This guy is dangerous,
too dangerous!

24:59.319 --> 25:03.085
You seem to be doing
something interesting.

25:03.087 --> 25:06.726
And I smell something
very nice.

25:06.728 --> 25:10.082
This is my wife's
birthday party.

25:10.084 --> 25:11.319
Wife's?

25:11.321 --> 25:14.275
Then you should
introduce her to me.

25:14.277 --> 25:15.459
Lord Bills.

25:15.461 --> 25:18.041
Oh yes, I forgot something
very important.

25:19.829 --> 25:24.835
Say, does "Super Saiyan
God" ring a bell to you?

25:24.837 --> 25:27.225
Super Saiyan God?

25:27.227 --> 25:28.723
You don't know?

25:28.725 --> 25:31.503
Your precognitive dream
as expected, was wrong?

25:31.505 --> 25:33.439
There is no "wrong" in my dictionary.

25:35.323 --> 25:36.998
There seems to be a lot?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.547
You're a little annoying.

25:40.726 --> 25:43.047
You disappeared without
saying anything, Vegeta.

25:43.049 --> 25:44.878
And this is?

25:44.880 --> 25:47.625
This is Lord Bills and...

25:47.627 --> 25:49.281
It's Whis.

25:49.283 --> 25:51.008
People you know?

25:51.010 --> 25:53.277
Hello, I'm Bulma.

25:53.279 --> 25:56.761
I'm Vegeta's beautiful wife.

25:56.763 --> 25:59.415
Hello, Bulma.

25:59.417 --> 26:02.602
They are well mannered people,
unexpected from your accomplices.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.696
Although they don't looking
like they're from Earth.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.981
Aliens, you're aliens!

26:07.983 --> 26:09.407
Enough!

26:09.409 --> 26:13.837
We found Vegeta after
coincidentally arriving on Earth.

26:13.839 --> 26:14.998
Are you tourists?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.815
If you don't mind would
you like to join us?

26:17.817 --> 26:19.191
We welcome you.

26:19.193 --> 26:20.108
Oi!

26:20.110 --> 26:23.026
Thank you for your concern.

26:23.028 --> 26:27.624
The truth is, we've been seeing and smelling
nice looking food since a while ago.

26:28.950 --> 26:31.033
Please enjoy yourselves!

26:31.760 --> 26:33.876
Let's go.

27:01.375 --> 27:04.844
Where are the Dragon Balls?

27:04.846 --> 27:08.069
All seven should have been
collected here.

27:08.071 --> 27:12.437
I don't know why they're not making
a wish, but to us it's a chance!

27:14.631 --> 27:18.055
Our next goal is wealth!

27:18.057 --> 27:20.794
Wasn't it world domination?

27:20.796 --> 27:23.886
Obtaining wealth comes first!

27:23.888 --> 27:26.814
I'm sick of living in poverty!

27:26.816 --> 27:31.679
With a child's body, I won't even
be able to get a part time job!

27:34.808 --> 27:39.112
I am Emperor Pilaf!

27:40.934 --> 27:45.114
We were finally able to
make a wish to Shenron...

27:45.116 --> 27:49.062
Then you said, "Give us Youth!"

27:49.064 --> 27:54.928
Even so, there would be no point
in dominating the world at an old age,
then to just die.

27:54.930 --> 27:57.400
But we became too young.

27:57.402 --> 27:58.698
I have no complaints.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.710
I've already exceeded a
dog's life expectancy.

28:04.292 --> 28:07.716
Don't just mess around,
find the Dragon Balls!

28:07.718 --> 28:10.659
If we can't find them,
at least take something of value!

28:10.661 --> 28:12.000
Yes sir!

28:17.171 --> 28:18.386
Lord Pilaf!

28:18.388 --> 28:19.918
What?!

28:19.920 --> 28:21.383
This...

28:22.224 --> 28:23.678
Let's see.

28:25.192 --> 28:27.693
Bingo Prizes?

28:37.466 --> 28:38.320
Perhaps...

28:38.322 --> 28:39.433
All of this!

28:39.435 --> 28:41.451
is the prize?!

28:41.453 --> 28:43.679
A castle as a prize?!

28:43.681 --> 28:47.499
The wealthy are clearly different.

28:50.632 --> 28:53.299
I'll tag on it!

28:58.878 --> 29:00.535
You're not a child...

29:05.273 --> 29:08.004
Maybe in this castle...

29:08.006 --> 29:09.599
Lord Pilaf!

29:09.601 --> 29:10.604
Did you find them?

29:10.606 --> 29:15.305
It's 10 years worth of
ham!

29:17.275 --> 29:19.077
Take around 2 to 3.

29:20.328 --> 29:22.995
What is the prize for 2nd place?

29:24.973 --> 29:27.749
It's an enormous diamond!

29:27.751 --> 29:29.347
Let's take it!

29:29.349 --> 29:31.397
Wait, if this is the 2nd place prize..

29:31.399 --> 29:33.134
The 1st place prize is...

29:37.431 --> 29:39.339
We found it too easily.

29:39.341 --> 29:40.439
Lord Pilaf.

29:40.441 --> 29:43.951
All 7 are here!

29:43.953 --> 29:50.112
Hooray!

29:50.799 --> 29:54.138
Lord Pilaf, let's make our wish here.

29:55.356 --> 29:56.618
Fool!

29:56.620 --> 30:00.737
If we were to call Shenron here,
the ceiling would collapse!

30:00.739 --> 30:02.910
Hey, you guys!

30:05.561 --> 30:07.883
What are you doing here?

30:09.033 --> 30:12.403
We're friends to this place!

30:12.405 --> 30:14.652
My friend?

30:14.654 --> 30:16.800
Are you the son of the owner?

30:16.802 --> 30:18.231
A talking monkey!

30:18.233 --> 30:20.844
Monkey...!

30:20.846 --> 30:22.087
Who's the monkey?!

30:22.089 --> 30:24.681
I am Emperor Pilaf!

30:26.337 --> 30:28.415
We are burgulars.

30:28.417 --> 30:30.878
Why are you telling him our identity?!

30:32.015 --> 30:34.636
Oi, Goten,
come here.

30:34.638 --> 30:36.370
There's a funny monkey here!

30:36.372 --> 30:37.385
I am not a monkey!

30:38.064 --> 30:40.156
Hey, child,
be quiet!

30:40.158 --> 30:42.119
Do you want to get hurt?

30:42.121 --> 30:43.628
What?

30:43.630 --> 30:45.397
That!

30:46.171 --> 30:49.151
That classical hairstyle...

30:49.153 --> 30:51.816
I've seen it before.

31:15.268 --> 31:17.539
I'll give you this!

31:23.982 --> 31:27.103
Lord Pilaf, wait!

31:28.930 --> 31:32.259
That was one weird monkey.

31:33.729 --> 31:37.780
Hey, who's that pretty girl
who gifted you that shiny rock?

31:37.782 --> 31:39.825
Your friend, Trunks?

31:39.827 --> 31:42.880
She is my girl friend!

31:43.592 --> 31:45.575
Amazing, right?

31:45.577 --> 31:47.831
Are you two dating?

31:47.833 --> 31:51.707
Well, yeah.
We've held hands too.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.334
Amazing!

31:53.336 --> 31:55.157
Right.

31:55.159 --> 31:57.043
Amazing.

32:05.301 --> 32:07.741
Crap, why is he here?!

32:07.743 --> 32:09.963
He was a child too.

32:09.965 --> 32:14.112
We weren't able to obtain
the Dragon Balls because of him!

32:17.224 --> 32:18.564
Crap, what is this?!

32:18.566 --> 32:22.109
Look at this!

32:22.585 --> 32:26.643
I fooled their eyes with the diamond!

32:26.645 --> 32:31.484
They won't realise that
the four star ball was robbed!

32:33.135 --> 32:34.703
Well done, Mai!

32:34.705 --> 32:35.683
Yes!

32:35.685 --> 32:39.194
Wait, we can't make a wish
with one.

32:39.196 --> 32:41.876
Don't worry, Lord Pilaf.

32:41.878 --> 32:49.116
We'll tell them,
"If you want this back give us a
million Zennies!"

32:51.951 --> 32:55.344
That girl is Trunks' girl friend?

32:55.346 --> 32:59.647
I don't know who's bloodline
you're related to but, not bad~

32:59.649 --> 33:01.157
Amazing.

33:01.159 --> 33:02.732
Amazing.

33:02.734 --> 33:04.143
Well, yeah.

33:04.145 --> 33:05.619
Bring her here.

33:09.327 --> 33:10.979
Hey.

33:10.981 --> 33:14.954
Did you fly here young master?!

33:14.956 --> 33:22.225
I was trying to act cool and
said that you're my girl friend...

33:22.227 --> 33:23.605
Me?!

33:23.607 --> 33:24.765
Not you!

33:24.767 --> 33:25.619
Me?!

33:25.621 --> 33:28.894
How did it come to that?!
that girl there!

33:29.745 --> 33:31.247
Me?!

33:31.249 --> 33:33.836
Why would I.. with a child like you...

33:33.838 --> 33:37.169
You're a child too.

33:37.171 --> 33:37.997
So I was.

33:37.999 --> 33:41.604
Sorry but would you act out for a bit.

33:41.606 --> 33:45.041
Acting like your girl friend?
What should I do?

33:45.043 --> 33:47.543
Well, holding hands...

33:47.545 --> 33:48.647
HANDS?!

33:49.838 --> 33:52.615
Why are kids these days
so rebellious?

33:52.617 --> 33:55.163
You can eat all the foods you want!

33:55.165 --> 33:56.949
All the foods you want!

33:56.951 --> 33:59.279
There's also a Bingo Competition.

33:59.281 --> 34:01.459
Okay, thats fine.

34:01.461 --> 34:02.984
Please wait a moment.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.019
Lord Pilaf,
even though he's just a kid...

34:06.021 --> 34:09.782
To hold his hands
after just meeting him would be...

34:09.784 --> 34:12.679
You're already old enough!

34:12.681 --> 34:15.935
Even if it's from you, there's
a line!

34:16.417 --> 34:17.799
You're doing it, Mai.

34:17.801 --> 34:20.699
It's for the nice foods,
bingo and...

34:20.701 --> 34:22.746
We'll get the Dragon Balls there!

34:23.748 --> 34:26.797
I think I've seen that
woman before.

34:39.889 --> 34:42.293
Back then!

34:42.295 --> 34:44.493
Right?!

34:44.495 --> 34:47.940
The one with that kid back there...

34:48.954 --> 34:51.484
There's nothing but trouble here..

34:51.485 --> 34:52.706
Let's go.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.697
Okay...

34:55.873 --> 35:01.144
This Takoyaki thing is interesting...

35:01.146 --> 35:02.570
Very delicious.

35:02.572 --> 35:06.530
The thing called Sauce and Soy Sauce
are very delicious as well.

35:07.934 --> 35:09.729
So your name is Mai.

35:09.731 --> 35:11.404
How old are you, Mai?

35:11.406 --> 35:13.004
I'm 41 years old.

35:13.918 --> 35:16.052
Don't make fun of an adult!

35:17.774 --> 35:20.303
Ga-

35:20.305 --> 35:23.412
me-

35:23.414 --> 35:25.955
ha-

35:25.957 --> 35:27.756
me-

35:27.758 --> 35:30.838
Please don't cause more destruction.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.841
HA!

35:54.795 --> 35:57.132
Ruthless!

36:02.661 --> 36:07.765
Not good enough, I won't be able to
defeat the God of Destruction.

36:07.767 --> 36:10.614
Lord Bills was much more powerful!

36:13.141 --> 36:16.099
Hey, King Kai.

36:16.101 --> 36:19.071
With such little training,

36:19.073 --> 36:22.581
I don't think I can become a
Super Saiyan God.

36:24.040 --> 36:27.303
On another note,
it's not appearing.

36:27.305 --> 36:30.114
The Super Saiyan God.

36:30.116 --> 36:33.841
I was a little excited.

36:34.474 --> 36:36.821
It seems that the Saiyans here,

36:36.823 --> 36:41.687
are all half-bloods except
Son Goku and Vegeta.

36:41.689 --> 36:44.587
And two of them are still kids.

36:46.225 --> 36:50.703
It's time for what you've been waiting for!
Bingo Competition!

36:52.135 --> 36:55.772
Although there are great prizes
like a castle and a plane,

36:55.774 --> 36:58.914
the best of them all,

36:58.916 --> 37:02.690
are the 7 Dragon Balls!

37:02.692 --> 37:07.125
You'll be able to make any wish
after you win!

37:11.169 --> 37:15.063
Those look similar to the wish marbles
from Planet Namek.

37:15.065 --> 37:18.423
Seems that Earth's god is from Namek.

37:18.425 --> 37:24.452
If I'm correct, a dragon appears
from those marbles and grants a wish?

37:25.347 --> 37:27.660
Hey, wait a moment!

37:27.662 --> 37:30.278
There's one missing!

37:31.063 --> 37:32.661
The 4 star is gone!

37:32.663 --> 37:35.705
Can't be! They were all here a while ago.

37:35.707 --> 37:37.337
Hey, you're going already?

37:37.339 --> 37:40.095
Mai, tell me your phone number.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.979
I don't have a high tech
device like that!

37:42.981 --> 37:44.834
Wait!

37:46.151 --> 37:47.750
Idiot!

37:51.091 --> 37:53.781
Crap, we've fallen into a trap.

37:53.783 --> 37:56.322
It's because you were being loud!

37:56.324 --> 37:58.569
Since it came to this,
it can't be helped.

37:59.239 --> 37:59.976
Crap!

37:59.978 --> 38:01.332
Lord Pilaf!

38:01.848 --> 38:03.342
Hey, you guys!

38:03.344 --> 38:08.277
If you don't want to see this kid die,
hand over a million Zennies!

38:10.738 --> 38:12.765
100,000 Zennies also good...

38:17.099 --> 38:18.417
What's funny?

38:18.419 --> 38:19.701
We'll really kill him!

38:19.703 --> 38:24.788
They say they'll kill him,
but everyone's laughing.

38:24.790 --> 38:26.402
Does this require a punishment.

38:26.404 --> 38:30.110
No, that girl seems to be
my son's girl friend.

38:30.112 --> 38:32.985
They're playing a boring prank!

38:32.987 --> 38:35.822
We're really going to shoot!

38:35.824 --> 38:37.208
Hey, Mai?

38:37.210 --> 38:38.568
Shut up, hostage!

38:38.570 --> 38:40.187
Your chest is touching me.

38:40.798 --> 38:43.522
This is an interesting scene!

38:43.524 --> 38:46.477
Good! I'll join as well!

38:49.072 --> 38:50.834
Cute villains!

38:50.836 --> 38:55.453
The Great Saiyan Man
will not forgive evil deeds!

38:56.372 --> 38:57.708
Suspicious...

38:57.710 --> 39:01.118
Is that the Super Saiyan God?

39:01.120 --> 39:02.535
Please don't misunderstand!

39:02.537 --> 39:06.532
That's just Kakarot's son
wearing a costume.

39:06.534 --> 39:09.313
Lady, try shooting me!

39:09.315 --> 39:10.685
Something like that...

39:10.687 --> 39:11.993
Don't come!

39:11.995 --> 39:14.494
You can really shoot!

39:14.496 --> 39:17.116
That would be more fun!

39:17.805 --> 39:21.473
Thats right, while at it,
shoot all the bullets!

39:21.475 --> 39:23.118
That would be good!

39:23.120 --> 39:25.176
A... All?

39:25.178 --> 39:29.604
It's fine, this person can
deflect all of them away.

39:29.606 --> 39:32.615
Don't shoot my legs, that would
be boring.

39:32.617 --> 39:35.005
Aim for my face.

39:35.007 --> 39:37.548
Okay, villain!
Shoot!

39:37.550 --> 39:39.250
Have it your way!

39:44.006 --> 39:45.210
How was that villain!?

39:45.212 --> 39:48.292
Did you realise,
The Great Saiyan Man's power?

39:49.064 --> 39:52.895
He's acting unusual after
drinking some Sake.

39:52.897 --> 39:57.357
You guys, I thought that was a toy,
but it was a real gun!

39:57.359 --> 40:00.288
It's not good for a kid to carry this!

40:00.290 --> 40:03.452
If it wasn't me,
something serious would have happened!

40:03.454 --> 40:04.727
It hurts!

40:06.357 --> 40:08.384
Videl, are you okay?!

40:08.386 --> 40:10.004
Videl!

40:10.006 --> 40:13.378
Gohan, you made your wife
get injured!

40:13.380 --> 40:15.220
I.. I'm sorry!

40:15.222 --> 40:17.512
I'll heal her.

40:17.514 --> 40:18.961
What are you trying to do?

40:18.963 --> 40:22.499
Watch your mouth,
he is a god.

40:22.501 --> 40:23.732
God?!

40:23.734 --> 40:24.905
Really?!

40:24.907 --> 40:27.034
Oi, were you a god?!

40:30.621 --> 40:31.947
It's healed.

40:31.949 --> 40:34.223
Thank you very much, god.

40:34.225 --> 40:36.913
Umm.. inside your belly...

40:38.790 --> 40:40.111
It's still a secret!

40:40.113 --> 40:41.407
I see!

40:41.409 --> 40:43.812
Gohan, you're temporarily
banned from having alcohol!

40:43.814 --> 40:44.630
Do you understand?!

40:44.632 --> 40:45.848
Yes!

40:45.850 --> 40:49.434
Thank you, Dende..
No.. God!

40:49.436 --> 40:52.924
It flew at me as well...

40:54.249 --> 40:55.842
It itches a little.

40:55.844 --> 40:56.929
It's not a good feeling.

40:56.931 --> 40:58.669
Not a good feeling at all!

40:58.671 --> 41:01.676
In that case, are you going to
destroy Earth?

41:01.678 --> 41:06.541
It'll be best to renew the entire star.

41:09.556 --> 41:13.108
Before creation,
there shall be destruction.

41:13.110 --> 41:16.052
Hey, you guys!!

41:16.991 --> 41:18.637
The sideshows over!

41:18.639 --> 41:23.227
It's time to have fun with Bingo!

41:24.460 --> 41:30.368
BINGO~â¬

41:30.370 --> 41:32.128
Why is Vegeta like that...

41:32.130 --> 41:34.226
Enjoyable  BINGO~â¬

41:34.228 --> 41:38.842
Earth is a fun place~â¬

41:38.844 --> 41:43.483
THE  FOOD  IS  ALSO  TASTY~â¬

41:43.485 --> 41:48.366
Enjoyable BINGO~â¬

41:50.343 --> 41:51.725
That was slightly creepy.

41:51.727 --> 41:55.702
Yeah, his singing and dancing skills
were so bad.

41:55.704 --> 41:57.652
Would be a good match-up with
Whis' singing.

41:57.654 --> 41:59.103
Priceless...

42:00.294 --> 42:03.819
Well, lets calm down and
continue our meal.

42:03.821 --> 42:05.124
Yeah.

42:07.197 --> 42:09.367
Good job.

42:09.369 --> 42:12.280
You guys, these aren't toys.

42:12.282 --> 42:14.584
Don't run off with them.

42:14.586 --> 42:17.476
But the act was a little enjoyable!

42:17.478 --> 42:18.757
Thank you.

42:18.759 --> 42:22.683
Since we have all the Dragon Balls,
we'll start bingo!

42:25.110 --> 42:30.548
I threw away my pride, just to
calm down Lord Bills...

42:30.550 --> 42:32.471
But there shouldn't be
anymore problems.

42:32.473 --> 42:36.239
What's left to do is to hope for him
to leave Earth satisfied...

42:42.674 --> 42:44.538
Anyone done?

42:47.540 --> 42:52.973
Lord Bills, have you tried those
deserts called pudding?

42:52.975 --> 42:55.702
They're very smooth and tasty.

42:55.704 --> 42:57.512
What, pudding?

42:57.514 --> 42:59.528
Where are those?

42:59.530 --> 43:00.985
Over there.

43:01.831 --> 43:06.328
Hey you, wouldnt you share one of those?

43:06.330 --> 43:08.797
Two, including mine.

43:10.664 --> 43:13.721
If it's troublesome, only one for me
would be fine.

43:13.723 --> 43:15.427
You're selfish, Lord Bills.

43:15.429 --> 43:17.757
You already ate one!

43:18.274 --> 43:20.055
Give me one.

43:20.057 --> 43:21.111
I don't want to!

43:21.113 --> 43:21.834
What did you say?!

43:21.836 --> 43:23.638
I'm going to eat all of it alone!

43:23.640 --> 43:25.267
Even when there's so many?!

43:25.269 --> 43:26.878
All mine!

43:30.535 --> 43:31.383
Hand it over!

43:31.385 --> 43:31.868
I don't want to!

43:31.870 --> 43:32.902
Hand it over!

43:32.904 --> 43:33.608
I don't want to!

43:33.610 --> 43:35.415
Hand it over, idiot!

43:36.802 --> 43:37.910
You called me an idiot!

43:37.912 --> 43:40.283
I'll turn you into snack and eat you!

43:40.662 --> 43:43.019
Shit, just when I take my eyes off...

43:43.681 --> 43:48.037
You've made me angry!!

43:57.870 --> 43:58.754
Wait...!

43:58.756 --> 44:00.516
Lord Bills, please calm down!

44:00.518 --> 44:03.194
Stop him!

44:22.935 --> 44:25.848
Since you didn't hand over a pudding,
I'll make it especially painful.

44:25.850 --> 44:27.254
Stop it!

44:36.426 --> 44:38.523
Crap, whatever!

44:45.809 --> 44:47.215
Thank you for waiting.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.140
This is very delicious!

44:54.142 --> 44:56.102
What is this food called?

44:58.229 --> 45:00.711
It's called Sushi.

45:08.549 --> 45:11.605
Fusion-

45:11.607 --> 45:12.822
Fusion- HAH!

45:17.146 --> 45:20.421
Your fighting sense is impressive.

45:20.423 --> 45:22.578
Oi, the Cat-Human over there!

45:22.580 --> 45:25.004
Just because of a pudding!

45:25.006 --> 45:29.675
I, Gotenks will beat up someone
with such poor manners!

45:29.677 --> 45:31.019
What did you say?

45:31.021 --> 45:34.465
You Earthlings would have
tried it a lot.

45:34.467 --> 45:38.592
But to me, it's a food which I can't
even imagine the taste of!

45:38.594 --> 45:40.050
Pudding!

45:40.052 --> 45:44.500
It looks so delicious
and beautiful!

45:44.502 --> 45:46.576
Loud!

45:47.164 --> 45:50.528
Stop it, he's not an opponent you can...

45:52.456 --> 45:54.932
It hurts, it hurts!

45:57.767 --> 46:00.102
We're sorry!

46:07.244 --> 46:10.746
I knew he was strong,

46:10.748 --> 46:13.865
but I didn't think he'd be
at this kind of level.

46:13.867 --> 46:16.795
Crap, is this the end?

46:17.369 --> 46:22.558
No pudding, and
no Super Saiyan god.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.280
There is only left to destroy.

46:31.615 --> 46:35.341
It'd be an honor to be killed by
the God of Destruction, Bills.

46:36.583 --> 46:39.444
You're saying nice things aren't you.

46:39.446 --> 46:42.569
Well then, as you wish...

46:42.571 --> 46:45.263
Wait, that's enough!

46:45.265 --> 46:48.108
I don't know whether you're Vegeta's
accomplice or not but,

46:48.110 --> 46:51.814
you ruined my 38th birthday!

46:51.816 --> 46:54.063
She was 38 years old!

47:01.657 --> 47:03.256
You... you

47:03.258 --> 47:10.826
hit my Bulma!

47:11.708 --> 47:14.430
You bastard!

47:27.776 --> 47:29.329
He sure is amazing.

47:29.331 --> 47:34.061
That Vegeta,
he finally exceeded Goku.

47:40.424 --> 47:41.880
Take this!

47:49.336 --> 47:50.862
What's that?

47:52.653 --> 47:58.132
Are they shooting fireworks again
at Capsule Corp?

47:59.223 --> 48:00.754
How's that?

48:05.740 --> 48:09.848
As expected, that wasn't the
Super Saiyan God either.

48:09.850 --> 48:12.870
I don't care, I'm going to
destroy Earth and go home.

48:12.872 --> 48:14.458
Whis!

48:14.460 --> 48:16.641
Please wait a moment!

48:16.643 --> 48:18.718
Sea Urchin?

48:18.720 --> 48:21.042
This is also very delicious.

48:22.341 --> 48:26.471
I won't let you just
detroy and destroy!

48:26.473 --> 48:29.884
You're a pain,
I already said it's over.

48:34.139 --> 48:35.181
Vegeta!

48:36.552 --> 48:38.046
Vegeta!

48:39.554 --> 48:41.013
Hey, Whis!

48:42.605 --> 48:45.024
Did you call me, Lord Bills?

48:45.026 --> 48:52.047
As you said, it seems that Super Saiyan God
was just a lousy dream.

48:52.049 --> 48:54.983
I said it before!
We're destroying Earth and going back!

48:54.985 --> 48:58.967
I understand, but
please wait a moment.

49:00.093 --> 49:02.917
How's your Tuna Roll?

49:02.919 --> 49:04.338
It's the best!

49:04.340 --> 49:07.394
But it seems that there's
not much time left.

49:07.396 --> 49:10.295
Can I have this as takeaway?

49:38.540 --> 49:39.837
Wait!

49:44.390 --> 49:46.377
Goku
/ Mr Goku!

49:55.106 --> 49:56.173
Son!

50:03.535 --> 50:05.126
It's you again?

50:05.128 --> 50:06.332
What is it this time?

50:06.334 --> 50:09.300
Did you get a clue on
God?

50:09.302 --> 50:14.453
That's still a mystery,
but don't destroy this planet.

50:14.455 --> 50:17.571
I am the God of Destruction.

50:17.573 --> 50:19.814
I know, Lord Bills.

50:19.816 --> 50:22.916
But, just this time,
can you let it pass?

50:22.918 --> 50:26.095
Then what, are you going to
fight me again?

50:26.097 --> 50:30.487
I'd like to... but..

50:30.489 --> 50:35.099
To be honest, I don't think
I stand a chance against you.

50:35.101 --> 50:36.758
That's it!

50:36.760 --> 50:40.161
Lord Bills, can I test something?

50:40.163 --> 50:41.394
What?

50:41.396 --> 50:44.493
You know, that
Super Saiyan God.

50:44.495 --> 50:47.689
I might be able to do it!

50:47.691 --> 50:48.933
How?

50:48.935 --> 50:50.966
Give me a little time!

50:50.968 --> 50:53.558
Just a little!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.064
Please!

50:55.066 --> 50:57.952
Fine, only a little.

50:57.954 --> 50:59.224
Thank you.

51:05.308 --> 51:09.076
Bulma, I'll use these Dragon Balls.

51:09.078 --> 51:14.661
Okay, if you're going to defeat that
bad mannered idiot.

51:14.663 --> 51:18.599
You're mean,
he's a god!

51:18.601 --> 51:20.863
Did you say, god?

51:20.865 --> 51:21.901
Yay

51:21.903 --> 51:26.748
What, if you're a god,
don't get mad over a pudding, idiot!

51:27.939 --> 51:30.096
He's not an ordinary god.

51:30.098 --> 51:34.213
He's the world's most fearsome,
the God of Destruction.

51:34.215 --> 51:36.006
He's called Lord Bills.

51:36.008 --> 51:38.195
He's the strongest in the world.

51:38.197 --> 51:42.420
Even the Supreme Kai and King Kai,
wet themselves in front of him!

51:43.605 --> 51:47.317
Everyone, please watch your tone.

51:47.319 --> 51:53.966
When Lord Bills get upset,
a galaxy disappears in an instant.

51:53.968 --> 51:55.557
Bi... Lord Bills!

51:55.559 --> 51:58.180
Stop it!
It won't work from a middle-aged woman!

51:58.182 --> 51:59.157
Shut up!

52:00.964 --> 52:04.882
Goku, what are you trying to do
with the Dragon Balls?

52:04.884 --> 52:07.151
Come out, Shenron!

52:07.153 --> 52:09.974
And grant my wish!

52:11.364 --> 52:15.333
That's right! You're trying to ask
Shenron to prevent the destruction of Earth!

52:15.335 --> 52:17.870
Nope, that's overdoing it.

52:33.871 --> 52:36.887
Capsule Corp?

52:36.889 --> 52:40.117
The wealthy sure do
put on a different show.

52:41.032 --> 52:44.023
I'll grant any wish.

52:44.025 --> 52:45.833
Speak.

52:45.835 --> 52:48.397
Hey, Shenron.

52:48.399 --> 52:52.932
Do you know about
Super Saiyan God?

52:52.934 --> 52:54.971
What's that?

52:54.973 --> 52:58.297
It's the same question as I had.

52:58.299 --> 53:00.551
Yeah, I know about it.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.461
You know? Really?!

53:02.463 --> 53:07.898
It's true. Is your wish to ask
whether it's real or not?

53:07.900 --> 53:12.443
No, if you do know,
could you bring it here?

53:12.445 --> 53:14.350
I cannot.

53:14.352 --> 53:17.083
It doesn't exist.

53:17.085 --> 53:19.907
Super Saiyan God is,

53:19.909 --> 53:24.177
a god created by the Saiyans.

53:24.179 --> 53:26.226
What do you mean by that?

53:26.228 --> 53:28.150
You have a lot of questions.

53:28.152 --> 53:31.117
What exactly is your wish?

53:31.119 --> 53:35.927
Lord Bills says, hand over the
Super Saiyan God.

53:35.929 --> 53:39.083
Lord Bills..?!

53:39.085 --> 53:41.545
Lord Bills...
Nice to meet you...

53:41.547 --> 53:46.226
Teach me how to make a
Super Saiyan God.

53:46.228 --> 53:47.117
Yes sir...

53:47.119 --> 53:49.330
I've never seen Shenron like that.

53:50.501 --> 53:54.138
The Super Saiyan God,

53:54.140 --> 53:59.892
revolted after feeling the darkness within
your fellow Saiyan comrades.

53:59.894 --> 54:06.259
It was a saviour created by Saiyans
with good morals which was rare.

54:06.261 --> 54:12.879
This saviour quickly defeated the
dark-hearted Saiyans with incredible
strength.

54:12.881 --> 54:15.820
But with a few left to go,
the saviour returned to normal.

54:15.822 --> 54:18.828
The saviour used up all their strength.

54:18.830 --> 54:22.984
Afterwards, Planet Vegeta became
a place filled with evil Saiyans,

54:22.986 --> 54:27.759
and the saviour disappeared,
even from legends.

54:27.761 --> 54:30.361
The disappeared legend,

54:30.363 --> 54:32.146
That's one long story!

54:32.148 --> 54:34.025
Do you understand, Vegeta?

54:35.705 --> 54:40.193
If five good-hearted Saiyans
hold hands and,

54:40.195 --> 54:44.484
if the light from one good-hearted Saiyan's
heart is transmitted,

54:44.486 --> 54:48.078
That Saiyan becomes the Saiyan God.

54:49.326 --> 54:52.937
I've taught you the procedure,
this is goodbye.

54:52.939 --> 54:55.151
Excuse me.

55:01.529 --> 55:05.896
Five good-hearted Saiyans?

55:05.898 --> 55:07.277
Impossible.

55:07.279 --> 55:10.558
That means there's only
Gohan and Goten.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.284
That's rude!

55:12.286 --> 55:17.851
Despite Vegeta, Trunks
has a good heart!

55:17.853 --> 55:22.202
Someone with a girl friend at such age
is impure.

55:22.204 --> 55:24.416
Which era are you living in?

55:24.418 --> 55:26.695
Aren't you being jealous?

55:26.697 --> 55:28.462
Yeah, Piccolo!

55:28.464 --> 55:30.941
Are you saying Goku is impure as well?!

55:32.483 --> 55:37.224
Without a doubt, Goku is kind,
but he's an idiot obssessed with fighting.

55:37.226 --> 55:40.412
Then it's quite debatable whether
he's good-hearted or not.

55:40.414 --> 55:41.948
Shut up, perverted old man!

55:41.950 --> 55:44.801
What?! You're being rude
to a good-hearted man!

55:44.803 --> 55:48.746
Shut up and make the
Super Saiyan God!

55:50.772 --> 55:54.428
Although Vegeta was bad in the past,

55:54.430 --> 55:55.965
how is he now?

55:55.967 --> 55:57.121
Is he bad?

55:57.123 --> 55:58.989
Come to think about it...

55:58.991 --> 56:02.532
That guy hasn't done anything
bad recently.

56:03.904 --> 56:06.667
Why is Kakarot the main?

56:06.669 --> 56:08.550
Stop complaining!

56:08.955 --> 56:12.351
Father, has anything changed?

56:12.353 --> 56:15.186
I wonder...

56:15.188 --> 56:16.951
Thank you for waiting.

56:16.953 --> 56:19.558
This is Fried Shrimp?

56:31.107 --> 56:32.883
Give me that as well.

56:51.483 --> 56:54.348
Goku became a god!

56:54.350 --> 56:57.296
Son, show us your power!

56:57.298 --> 56:59.363
Stop it, Goku.

57:00.412 --> 57:02.296
It's no use fighting.

57:02.298 --> 57:04.114
That's not god.

57:04.116 --> 57:05.629
But...

57:05.631 --> 57:11.105
Your power level only increased because
everyone's energy transferred to you.

57:12.433 --> 57:19.660
That's how it is, just because your power
level increased, it doesn't mean you're god.

57:19.662 --> 57:21.513
I see.

57:21.515 --> 57:22.945
As I expected...

57:22.947 --> 57:25.046
I don't think we can win gainst
Lord Bills.

57:25.048 --> 57:26.360
That can't be...

57:29.323 --> 57:30.977
Do you understand everyone?

57:30.979 --> 57:33.189
Think about it carefully.

57:33.191 --> 57:36.635
Five people are suppose to let their energy
flow into one other.

57:36.637 --> 57:41.447
That means you need
six saiyans, right?

57:41.449 --> 57:43.873
Is that so, I miscalculated!

57:43.875 --> 57:47.879
Six people?
We're missing one...

57:47.881 --> 57:51.719
That's right, Vegeta you had
a little brother!

57:51.721 --> 57:53.468
He's on a star far away.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.729
And I don't know where he is.

57:55.731 --> 57:58.340
Did you not ask for his
mobile number?

57:58.342 --> 58:02.030
That's enough,
I was expecting something fun.

58:02.032 --> 58:03.669
I'm disappointed.

58:03.671 --> 58:08.011
Since I'm tired,
I'm going to destroy Earth and return.

58:08.578 --> 58:11.345
Wait, there is one more!

58:12.090 --> 58:14.519
Videl, there's one more?

58:14.521 --> 58:17.330
Umm, how should I put it...

58:17.332 --> 58:19.775
Should I say one will become one?

58:19.777 --> 58:23.542
But, there is without a doubt,
a Saiyan's blood flowing!

58:23.544 --> 58:25.503
What are you talking about, Videl?

58:25.505 --> 58:28.857
Your dad is great,
but he's a normal human!

58:28.859 --> 58:30.796
Not you, dad!

58:30.798 --> 58:36.088
Umm, Videl is carrying
a baby!

58:39.500 --> 58:42.186
Really?!

58:42.188 --> 58:46.250
It's true, I kept it a secret
to surprise you, Gohan.

58:46.252 --> 58:48.066
Yay!!

58:54.525 --> 58:57.941
Can you become a god or not?

58:57.943 --> 59:02.151
Let's try again with Videl!

59:02.634 --> 59:06.216
Would it be okay?
The baby hasn't even been born.

59:06.218 --> 59:08.723
Anyways, let's try and see!

59:08.725 --> 59:09.755
Yes.

59:28.074 --> 59:30.630
Was it impossible?

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:34.216
Hey that's just normal Goku.

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:37.224
But look, his hair is red.

01:00:37.226 --> 01:00:40.227
That's true, and he became more lean.

01:00:40.229 --> 01:00:43.620
I can't read Goku's power level.

01:00:43.622 --> 01:00:47.284
Congratulations, it seems
you've succeeded!

01:00:47.286 --> 01:00:50.155
It was worth the wait.

01:00:50.157 --> 01:00:50.914
Really?

01:00:50.916 --> 01:00:54.502
Did I become a Super Saiyan God?

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:57.887
We'll know when we fight.

01:00:57.889 --> 01:01:00.096
Come at me.

01:01:00.098 --> 01:01:02.545
Okay, here I come!

01:01:02.547 --> 01:01:08.780
Fine, if you're stronger,
I won't destroy Earth.

01:01:08.782 --> 01:01:10.877
Really?
Thanks!

01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:48.186
How does it feel to have
become a god?

01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:49.478
I'm surprised.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.683
Is that so, I'm shocked.

01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:57.061
That's the same thought as I.

01:02:34.824 --> 01:02:37.691
Good, that's it!

01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:42.593
What's wrong, you look dissatisfied.

01:02:42.595 --> 01:02:43.944
A little.

01:02:43.946 --> 01:02:46.239
Do you dislike having become a god?

01:02:46.241 --> 01:02:49.838
Yeah, for a world like this to exist,

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.638
What do you mean?

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.514
it's a world I wasn't able to come alone.

01:02:54.516 --> 01:02:56.508
Is that something to complain about?

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:59.122
Yeah! I'm dissatisfied!

01:03:09.558 --> 01:03:11.489
What, is it an earthquake?

01:03:13.592 --> 01:03:15.778
You're saying interesting things.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:20.687
Do you dislike having made it
with your comrades?!

01:03:22.273 --> 01:03:25.344
I'm happy, happy but,

01:03:25.346 --> 01:03:30.683
I wasn't able to fight you without
borrowing everyone's power.

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.499
That annoys me!

01:03:32.501 --> 01:03:36.002
Then why did you become a God?

01:03:36.004 --> 01:03:38.924
Because I wanted to
fight with Lord Bills!

01:03:58.079 --> 01:03:59.531
Let's follow!

01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:00.413
Yes!

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:23.284
Our Ki have recovered!

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.748
Are you still dissatisfied about
being a god?

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.165
Yeah!

01:05:01.847 --> 01:05:04.600
That pride becomes a weakness!

01:05:24.849 --> 01:05:26.829
Such a lame pride you have.

01:05:28.568 --> 01:05:32.585
A saiyan with that kind of obssession
is rare.

01:05:39.461 --> 01:05:41.943
Such power!

01:05:47.225 --> 01:05:49.239
That's not entirely true.

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:54.450
Vegeta has much more pride than I!

01:05:54.452 --> 01:05:59.875
Come to think of it, he threw away
that pride and protected everyone.

01:05:59.877 --> 01:06:04.194
I know, for him to throw away
his pride as prince,

01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:05.458
Isn't it amazing?

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.020
I respected him a little.

01:06:09.055 --> 01:06:14.365
So did you throw away your pride as well,
and became a god?

01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:15.982
That's how it is.

01:06:15.984 --> 01:06:19.307
What are those two talking about?

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:22.915
It looks like Goku is receiving training.

01:06:24.787 --> 01:06:28.717
I'll say it but, I also have a complaint.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:30.345
What is it?

01:06:30.347 --> 01:06:34.914
I have yet to fight in my
full power!

01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:35.889
Really?

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:38.907
I used around 80%!

01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:40.579
80%?!

01:06:42.177 --> 01:06:45.575
In that case, would you be able to
keep up with this speed?!

01:06:57.528 --> 01:06:59.756
What's wrong? Are you being serious?!

01:07:00.752 --> 01:07:02.701
I'm being serious!

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.546
What is that, ranged attacks?!

01:07:28.148 --> 01:07:31.089
We're not playing sports.

01:07:49.352 --> 01:07:52.994
Don't enjoy destruction!

01:09:22.428 --> 01:09:25.036
That's Goku's Kameameha!

01:09:33.696 --> 01:09:35.023
What?

01:09:43.768 --> 01:09:45.854
Here's my return.

01:09:49.862 --> 01:09:52.430
I'll block such a thing!

01:10:03.719 --> 01:10:05.258
What is that?

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.046
It's Bill's attack.

01:10:07.048 --> 01:10:08.907
This is bad!

01:10:13.281 --> 01:10:16.026
Crap!

01:10:18.883 --> 01:10:21.792
It seems that you haven't realised.

01:10:21.794 --> 01:10:23.510
Ab..About what?

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:27.171
It's been a while since you lost your
Super Saiyan God powers.

01:10:27.173 --> 01:10:30.309
He's right.

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:33.768
But...

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:37.619
It seems that while you were fighting
as a god,

01:10:37.621 --> 01:10:41.981
you've absorbed that world into your body.

01:10:41.983 --> 01:10:47.091
That's why when you transformed back,
your powers didn't decrease drastically.

01:10:47.093 --> 01:10:48.868
You're really something.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:51.753
I would even call you a rare being,
a genius!

01:10:51.755 --> 01:10:54.625
That makes me happy, but...

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:56.777
In that case, be happy.

01:10:56.779 --> 01:10:58.860
That's what you wanted, right?

01:10:58.862 --> 01:11:00.535
I can't do that.

01:11:00.537 --> 01:11:03.218
The biggest problem is...

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:07.444
The fact that there is a huge
difference in power!

01:11:07.446 --> 01:11:10.576
Then, give up and surrender!

01:11:59.806 --> 01:12:01.768
What's happening?

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:20.117
Crap!

01:12:30.336 --> 01:12:31.468
Goku!

01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:33.539
Goku!

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.254
Oi, what did you do just now?

01:13:19.256 --> 01:13:22.971
I don't know.

01:13:22.973 --> 01:13:25.488
You don't know?

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.304
You are certainly interesting.

01:13:43.345 --> 01:13:46.854
What's up, why did you stop?

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:51.527
I wanted to say I lost to you.

01:13:51.529 --> 01:13:53.402
Lost...?

01:13:53.404 --> 01:13:55.576
I lost.

01:13:55.578 --> 01:13:57.489
Lord Bills you're really strong.

01:13:57.491 --> 01:14:00.154
I didn't stand a chance.

01:14:00.156 --> 01:14:02.340
You're certainly the universe's best!

01:14:02.342 --> 01:14:07.500
You've finally realised the terrifying power of,
Lord Bills; the God of Destruction.

01:14:07.502 --> 01:14:11.333
Nevertheless, you were certainly strong too.

01:14:11.335 --> 01:14:17.009
Up until now, you're the 2nd strongest
opponent I've faced in my long history of battles.

01:14:17.011 --> 01:14:20.784
What, I'm 2nd?

01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:26.695
Finally, I'll tell you something good.

01:14:26.697 --> 01:14:30.822
What, are you not going to
destroy Earth anymore?

01:14:30.824 --> 01:14:32.233
I can't do that.

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:36.075
I never go back on my decisions.

01:14:36.077 --> 01:14:38.638
Then, what?

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.392
It's about Whis, the guy
who looks after me.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:53.269
He looks after me, but
he is also my teacher.

01:14:53.271 --> 01:14:55.029
Teacher?

01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:57.767
Then the universe's strongest...

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.932
This is the 7th Universe.

01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:05.381
I am the 7th God of Destruction.

01:15:05.383 --> 01:15:09.331
There are 12 Universes in total.

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:12.522
Don't you think there would be,
many more powerful beings?

01:15:33.079 --> 01:15:34.111
Goku!

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:35.547
Goku!!

01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:40.825
I'm okay, I'm still alive.

01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:45.281
Then as promised,
I'll destroy Earth.

01:16:13.641 --> 01:16:19.336
Lord Bills, you've destroyed
a very small Earth.

01:16:19.338 --> 01:16:23.867
Unfortunately, I've used up
most of my stamina.

01:16:23.869 --> 01:16:27.671
I'll bring about complete destruction
next time.

01:16:27.673 --> 01:16:29.419
Lord Bills!

01:16:30.481 --> 01:16:35.239
You, when Lord Bills faces death, wouldn't you
like to become the next God of Destruction?

01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:36.716
Oi!

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:38.460
I'll have to reject that.

01:16:38.462 --> 01:16:40.147
That's unfortunate.

01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:41.608
Madame Bulma,

01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.628
Me?

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:45.316
What is it?

01:16:45.318 --> 01:16:48.008
Sorry for causing trouble.

01:16:48.429 --> 01:16:51.545
Other than that, apologise for hitting me!

01:16:52.702 --> 01:16:53.879
I'm sorry.

01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:55.869
Oi, are you stupid?

01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:58.703
If it's okay, invite me to another party.

01:16:58.705 --> 01:17:01.754
Only if you promise not to run wild.

01:17:01.756 --> 01:17:06.336
I understand, next time I will
definitely try that thing called pudding.

01:17:06.338 --> 01:17:08.928
I'll put tons in the pool!

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:12.418
But don't say it tastes awful
after eating it!

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:16.067
If it's awful, I'll destroy Earth.

01:17:16.069 --> 01:17:20.343
In that case, we'll be able to fight again,
right Lord Bills?

01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:22.026
This is goodbye.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.633
I can't believe it.

01:17:39.635 --> 01:17:41.261
It's without a doubt.

01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:49.341
The God of Destruction, Lord Bills,
didn't destroy!

01:17:49.343 --> 01:17:54.577
As expected, was it because of
Son Goku's mysterious character?

01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:57.795
He's gaining more comrades.

01:17:57.797 --> 01:18:00.509
Even Lord Bills...

01:18:01.537 --> 01:18:06.960
Put other things aside,
I can't see the extent to his potential.

01:18:06.962 --> 01:18:10.934
Though, it was nothing to worry about.

01:18:12.196 --> 01:18:19.579
Even so, it's been a while since
I've seen you use 70% of your powers, Lord Bills.

01:18:20.003 --> 01:18:21.836
What was he called again?

01:18:21.838 --> 01:18:24.218
Son Goku.

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:30.342
Perhaps in the distant future,
he and Vegeta might become a real
enemy of threat.

01:18:30.344 --> 01:18:39.036
Come to think about it, I brought
these Sushi because they were so delicious!

01:18:39.038 --> 01:18:42.250
What a pleasant looking food~

01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:47.357
You eat it with small amounts of this
thing called soy sauce.

01:18:47.359 --> 01:18:50.014
What's this pile of green stuff?

01:18:52.405 --> 01:18:54.220
Come to think about it, the chef said,

01:18:54.222 --> 01:18:59.738
"Eat it depending on your preference."
I think it was called wasabi.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.162
Come to think about it,
I heard something like that?

01:19:03.164 --> 01:19:06.197
While I was fighting...

01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:08.332
I'll bring something to drink.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.009
Let's give it a taste.

01:19:25.056 --> 01:19:26.100
You can't do that!

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:33.417
Please sleep for about three years.

01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:37.616
Lord Bills, you have to brush your teeth
before going to sleep!

01:19:39.395 --> 01:19:41.975
Okay, fine.

01:19:44.525 --> 01:19:46.604
One more time!

01:19:46.606 --> 01:19:50.436
Happy Birthday, Bulma!

01:19:50.438 --> 01:19:51.851
38 years old!

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.005
Shut up!

01:20:06.519 --> 01:20:10.865
When cornered, you just might be
the most fearsome being.

01:20:10.867 --> 01:20:12.387
Oi, Kakarot.

01:20:12.389 --> 01:20:16.950
Next time, I'm becoming God,
so cooperate!

01:20:16.952 --> 01:20:18.816
Of course!

01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:22.754
But if you push yourself to become
that strong, you'll collapse later!

01:20:23.574 --> 01:20:25.261
Oh yeah, Vegeta.

01:20:25.263 --> 01:20:32.169
When Bulma got hit, you shouted; "My Bulma!"
and became a great Super Saiyan!

01:20:32.171 --> 01:20:34.308
I felt loved~

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:37.851
I don't remember saying such thing!

01:20:37.853 --> 01:20:42.450
But, back then I definitely exceeded you!

01:20:42.452 --> 01:20:44.748
Yeah, without a doubt!

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:47.157
Next time when we're fighting someone strong,

01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:50.212
I'll ask them to hit Bulma!

01:20:50.214 --> 01:20:51.215
Oi!

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:57.863
When Vegeta was like that,
you shouldn't have been there.

01:20:57.865 --> 01:21:02.457
So you used instant transmission,
and watched from a distance.

01:21:05.769 --> 01:21:06.533
Son?

01:21:06.535 --> 01:21:08.377
Are you serious, bastard!

01:21:08.379 --> 01:21:10.508
While everyone was being handed in!

01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:16.052
Sorry, I wanted to strategize
before fighting the enemy!

01:21:16.054 --> 01:21:18.946
Although I didn't remember anything.

01:21:18.948 --> 01:21:22.030
Bulma, slap him two, no three more times!

01:21:22.032 --> 01:21:22.951
Yes sir!

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:27.032
I'm sorry! I regret it!

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:53.862
Ka

01:24:53.864 --> 01:24:55.125
Kame

01:24:55.127 --> 01:24:56.344
Kameha

01:24:56.346 --> 01:24:58.395
Kamehame

01:24:58.397 --> 01:25:02.328
Kamehame HA!
