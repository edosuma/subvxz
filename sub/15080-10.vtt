ARE WE GONNA BE OKAY?

39:46.054 --> 39:48.927
Daniel: REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
ALLOWED TO HAVE DO-OVERS?

39:48.927 --> 39:52.270
WEREN'T THEY MAGICAL
WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

39:52.270 --> 39:54.012
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE
WAY THINGS TURNED OUT ON THE --

39:54.012 --> 39:56.144
ON THE BASEBALL FIELD,
YOU JUST ASKED FOR A DO-OVER,

39:56.144 --> 39:59.227
AND IT WAS LIKE
THE STRIKEOUT NEVER HAPPENED.

39:59.227 --> 40:02.651
UNFORTUNATELY,
LIFE IS LESS ACCOMMODATING.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.823
EVERY MOMENT WE EXPERIENCE

40:04.823 --> 40:07.235
LEAVES A PERMANENT IMPRINT
ON OUR BRAINS,

40:07.235 --> 40:11.079
SHAPING HOW WE PERCEIVE THINGS
AND PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE.

40:11.079 --> 40:12.951
IT'S CALLED IMPLICIT MEMORY,

40:12.951 --> 40:18.537
AND IT'S CONSTANTLY REMINDING US
TO BE CAREFUL.

40:18.537 --> 40:22.250
WHO CAN WE TRUST?

40:22.250 --> 40:26.094
WHEN ARE WE SAFE?

40:26.094 --> 40:29.758
AND WHAT ARE WE CAPABLE OF?

40:33.141 --> 40:37.936
OF COURSE, THERE ARE BENEFITS
TO A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO LIFE.

40:37.936 --> 40:42.110
HELLO?
HELLO?

40:42.110 --> 40:45.153
HELPS US TO AVOID THE THINGS
THAT MAKE US UNHAPPY...

40:47.325 --> 40:49.868
...OR SICK...

40:53.241 --> 40:56.124
...OR PUT US IN DANGER.

40:56.124 --> 40:58.126
BUT THERE'S ONE DANGER

40:58.126 --> 41:03.341
THAT OUR IMPLICIT MEMORY
CAN'T HELP US WITH.

41:03.341 --> 41:06.004
AND THAT'S THE DANGER
THAT OUR BIASES

41:06.004 --> 41:11.720
CAN PREVENT US FROM SEEING
THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.682
AAH!

41:25.363 --> 41:27.235
DANIEL!
