00:01.131 --> 00:03.046
<i>Previously on "Alaska Daily"...</i>

00:03.090 --> 00:04.352
Her name is Gloria Nanmac.

00:04.395 --> 00:06.006
She went missing
two years ago.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.224
Her death is part
of a pattern,

00:07.268 --> 00:09.052
and I want you
both on it together.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.401
I don't care.
I work alone.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.707
You wanted to see me?

00:11.750 --> 00:13.100
Mrs. Nanmac.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.797
They told me I couldn't
get the autopsy.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.712
I'm not permitted to turn
over that report.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.496
It's an open investigation
in Meade.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.195
The coroner's report is
a clear indication of assault.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.848
They don't want to solve
these crimes.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.502
We gotta be patient.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.895
Tell that to the next mother
of a native missing girl.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.288
Toby?

00:27.331 --> 00:29.116
Who was Gloria with
when she disappeared?

00:29.159 --> 00:30.639
I don't know.
I didn't go to the after party.

00:30.682 --> 00:31.770
Where was it?
Whose house?

00:31.814 --> 00:33.642
Some guy called Skeeter.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.686
I could use your help
getting ahold of so--

00:34.730 --> 00:36.166
Whoa.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.733
Zachary. Belongs to Austin.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.865
Oh, he doesn't bite.
Just don't touch his iPad.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.564
If you print it,
it will destroy me.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.696
A token for your first
front page story.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.698
Thank you, guys.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.352
<i>Anchorage resident
Jordan Teller</i>

00:48.396 --> 00:51.790
<i>has died in a plane crash
in the Gulf of Alaska.</i>

00:51.834 --> 00:54.663
<i>Teller was the only one
on board at the time.</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:07.763
First time in the Arctic?

01:07.806 --> 01:11.636
Yeah. I think it is.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.290
No trees.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.988
Yeah, look at that.
No trees.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.121
Have you been up here
before?

01:18.165 --> 01:20.297
Some.
I don't really like it.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.603
Why not?

01:21.646 --> 01:23.039
I'm Tlingit.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.259
I grew up Southeast
in a rain forest.

01:25.302 --> 01:28.740
The "no tree" thing,
it doesn't really work for me.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.003
Tlingit?
Is that your tribe?

01:31.047 --> 01:32.614
We say culture.

01:32.657 --> 01:36.226
We never traditionally organized
as tribes.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.229
The native communities up here,
they're all IÃ±upiaq.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.667
Totally different culture,
languages, everything.

01:46.932 --> 01:51.067
- How are you doing?
- Oh, I'm glad
to be going home.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.114
Hey, if, um, it's too much
for us to stay with you,

01:54.157 --> 01:54.984
we can stay at the hotel.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.899
<i>Tavra!</i>

01:56.942 --> 01:59.989
You are my guests.
I insist.

02:04.385 --> 02:07.301
<i>We are beginning
our descent into Meade.</i>

02:07.344 --> 02:10.173
<i>Flight crew, please prepare
the cabin for landing.</i>

02:18.790 --> 02:21.706
Thank you for sitting down
with me, Mr. Moses.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.491
You're the paper of record
for Alaska.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.101
I'll do whatever I can to help
you write an accurate profile.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.060
So tell me, why are you
running for Senate?

02:28.104 --> 02:29.497
The Roger Mudd question.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.846
- It's a legitimate question.
- Of course it is.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.108
It's <i>the</i> question.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.501
Ted Kennedy
couldn't answer it,

02:33.544 --> 02:35.155
but I know exactly
why I'm running--

02:35.198 --> 02:37.287
for the same reason
you became a journalist.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.159
Which is what?

02:39.202 --> 02:40.986
A desire to make the world
a better place.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.119
You do it by holding people
like me accountable.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.686
I want to do it through
direct action

02:44.729 --> 02:46.035
once I'm elected
to the U.S. Senate.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.993
Okay, can you give me
a specific example?

02:48.037 --> 02:50.866
Act in the best interest
of all Alaskans.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.520
Uh, that's not
really specific.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.261
And how is it possible to act
in the best interest

02:54.304 --> 02:55.740
of all Alaskans?

02:55.784 --> 02:57.568
It's not easy to represent
the disparate interests

02:57.612 --> 03:00.441
of all the people
of this great state,

03:00.484 --> 03:01.833
but that's what
I plan to do.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.357
Can you give me one example

03:03.400 --> 03:06.534
of how you might...

03:06.577 --> 03:08.013
Everything okay?

03:08.057 --> 03:10.233
I gotta deal
with something.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.714
We will pick this
back up.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.890
Promise.
All right, well--

03:16.935 --> 03:19.199
Hey, Bob, Frank Moses
just got a text

03:19.242 --> 03:21.679
and ran out of my interview.
Is-- Is something up?

03:21.723 --> 03:23.986
An environmental activist
took unauthorized photos

03:24.029 --> 03:25.814
of a leak
at Meacham tailings pond.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.424
Is that LH Mining?

03:27.468 --> 03:29.600
<i>Yeah, he sent them to us
and TV outlets.</i>

03:29.644 --> 03:31.254
<i>It's bad.</i>

03:31.298 --> 03:32.995
Uh, okay, on my way.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.170
<i>Schmidt was attempting
to photograph...</i>

03:34.214 --> 03:35.650
This is really horrible.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.173
So upsetting.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.349
And just in time
for the upcoming election.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.785
It's gonna be very interesting
to see

03:40.829 --> 03:42.265
how the candidates
respond to this.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.268
Speaking of, Ford's on TV. <i>...or more is known.</i>

03:45.312 --> 03:48.010
Five bucks he says "malarkey"
and mentions Alaskan jobs.

03:48.053 --> 03:50.882
Another five he adds
"media stunt."

03:50.926 --> 03:52.275
<i>I call malarkey.</i>

03:52.319 --> 03:54.234
<i>Alaskan jobs are on the line</i>

03:54.277 --> 03:55.583
<i>and they will not be lost
to this media stunt.</i>

03:55.626 --> 03:58.063
Bob with the trifecta.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.369
I hope our publisher tracks
all this

03:59.413 --> 04:01.328
before he delivers
the paper's endorsement.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.113
Come on, Bob. You know
Pritchard's endorsing Moses.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.202
- I know no such thing.
- I just sat with him.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.508
I feel like
he already knows.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.074
Well, Moses is pro-fishing.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.511
I bet he's very upset
about this.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.816
Yeah, well,
according to Moses,

04:11.860 --> 04:12.948
he's pro-everything
and everyone.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.819
He just tweeted a response.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.691
"We have to advance
our mining safety practices

04:16.734 --> 04:18.388
and protect our watersheds.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.738
I stand with Alaskans
who need good, honest work,

04:20.782 --> 04:23.132
and I stand with the salmon."

04:23.175 --> 04:25.308
Can you stand with salmon?

04:27.441 --> 04:31.009
Hey, nothing
for my salmon joke?

04:31.053 --> 04:33.621
You still reading responses
from your Jordan Teller story?

04:33.664 --> 04:36.101
Some of the things people are
saying about me are horrible.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.539
Those aren't people.
They're trolls.

04:38.582 --> 04:39.801
Your story was solid.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.629
I know.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.848
But the truth is,
he killed himself because of it.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.198
We don't know that
for sure.

04:46.242 --> 04:49.332
I get it. It's intense,
but you reported the facts.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.813
How Teller reacted
is on Teller.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.032
It's messed up,
but still...

04:54.076 --> 04:57.384
Now, start by laying off
the trolls.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.211
Okay. Thanks.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.953
All right, people.
Lots to do.

05:01.997 --> 05:05.087
Bob, can you write-through
the run-off leak,

05:05.130 --> 05:07.263
get me a clean set
of follow-ups into LH Mining?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.699
Give 'em a deadline.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.267
Every question they don't
answer goes into this story.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.357
- Sure thing.
- Our Senate candidate profiles.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.751
Can we fold in responses
to the leak, please?

05:16.794 --> 05:18.622
Claire, how close are we
on Brewster?

05:18.666 --> 05:19.928
Wrapping it up.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.059
I'll add comment
to the Ford profile.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.887
Austin, where are we
with Moses?

05:22.931 --> 05:24.367
I had 10 minutes with him.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.717
He bolted after he heard
about the leak.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.632
I will dig into
his financial disclosures

05:28.676 --> 05:30.852
- while I wait to reschedule.
- Okay.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.636
Oh, hey, any word
on who Pritchard favors?

05:32.680 --> 05:35.944
No word. And we are
equal opportunity diggers.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.772
Get to it.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.078
Hey, help me
with Moses' financials?

05:40.122 --> 05:41.689
Sure. Yeah.
Okay, cool.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.045
You made it!
Hello!

06:18.029 --> 06:20.858
That's a good photo.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.557
She loved to dance.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.297
This is her room.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.110
She seems like
such a nice kid.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.894
How'd she end up
at Skeeter's?

06:56.938 --> 07:00.550
Like you said,
she's a kid.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.073
Fair point.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.080
Gloria made it.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.952
Is it mink?

07:10.995 --> 07:13.607
It's <i>itigiaq.</i> Ermine.

07:13.650 --> 07:14.999
Look at this.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.440
It's-- Those are walrus ivory
and baleen.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.833
She was getting
really good.

07:22.877 --> 07:27.534
The place where they found
Gloria's body, where is it?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.797
It's-- It's about three miles
from here on the tundra.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.538
You can't get there by car.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.627
How do we get there?

07:33.670 --> 07:36.325
I think I can help
with that.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.545
Just give me a few hours.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.547
Thank you.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.026
- Where are we going?
- Police station.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.593
Now?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.552
Better to cold call
before word gets out.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.857
Maybe we'll get lucky
and they'll give us

07:46.901 --> 07:49.164
the police report. Doubtful.

07:49.207 --> 07:52.036
I think we should go to the
Atanaura[ng]it offices first.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.647
The what offices?

07:53.690 --> 07:55.605
The Cultural Council.
We should tell them we're here,

07:55.649 --> 07:57.868
what we're working on,
and offer a gift.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.175
Oh, that sounds nice, but I want
to go to the cops first.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.394
The Council's not a bridge
you want to burn.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.484
We'll have to come back.
We'll need their help.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.398
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
to the cops first,

08:06.442 --> 08:08.618
and you can go to the Council,
and we can meet up later.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.538
Hi.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.062
We're with <i>The Daily Alaskan,</i>
doing a story on a death.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.368
We need to make
a records request

08:19.411 --> 08:20.935
for anything public
on the case file.

08:20.978 --> 08:23.720
Case number 3747.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.983
<i>Quyanaq. Tavra.</i>

08:26.027 --> 08:27.898
What's that mean?
"Thank you."

08:27.942 --> 08:30.161
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.479
That's still an open case.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.568
Funny, people keep
telling us that.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.527
Would you mind telling us
who's working that open case?

08:47.570 --> 08:48.963
We'd love to talk to him.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.747
Sure.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.969
Chief Durkin
was on that case.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.318
He wasn't the chief then.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.580
But he is now.

08:57.624 --> 08:58.973
Is the Chief in?

09:01.976 --> 09:05.327
Tell me, ladies, you don't have
stories down in Anchorage?

09:05.370 --> 09:08.199
We do, but the paper is looking
into some older cases

09:08.243 --> 09:09.636
we might not have
given enough attention to

09:09.679 --> 09:11.202
the first time around.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.377
For some reason,
we can't get our hands

09:12.421 --> 09:14.379
on Gloria Nanmac's
police report,

09:14.423 --> 09:16.599
so we thought we'd ask,
in person.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.906
That's a long way to come
for a police report.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.125
Could have just called
and saved yourselves a trip.

09:21.169 --> 09:24.128
Maybe, but then we wouldn't be
sitting across the table

09:24.172 --> 09:26.653
from the man who tried
to solve her murder.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.829
Murder, huh?

09:28.872 --> 09:30.657
What kind of story
are you lookin' to write?

09:30.700 --> 09:34.269
Well, since Gloria's case
is still open two years later,

09:34.312 --> 09:36.663
I assume you're still
actively working on it.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.535
I thought maybe you could walk
us through the investigation.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.624
That was a while ago.
I mean, I'd have to--

09:41.668 --> 09:44.105
I'd have to look
at the report.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.150
Things around here
were different back then,

09:46.194 --> 09:49.066
and, uh,
not in a good way.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.679
My predecessor,
Oren Conners, was a drunk.

09:52.722 --> 09:56.291
The department
was in disarray.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.859
Are you from around here?

09:58.902 --> 10:01.252
Not remotely.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.863
Yakutat.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.952
Southeast.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.041
- Haida?
- Tlingit.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.956
I really like it down there.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.567
I go fishing every summer.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.395
I admire your people.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.963
The Tlingit, they had this
whole system of government

10:16.006 --> 10:17.921
that went back
hundreds of years.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.575
Thousands, actually.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.099
Pretty smart, Tlingits.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.972
So how about
that police report?

10:25.015 --> 10:28.105
Sure thing. I'll just need
to give it, uh, a read-over

10:28.149 --> 10:31.587
and make sure that, uh, anything
sensitive is redacted.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.371
I'll drop it off later today.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.677
Great. We're staying at--

10:34.721 --> 10:36.287
Yeah, we'll find you.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.987
I don't like that guy.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.684
Is it because he white-splained
my own culture to me?

10:41.728 --> 10:44.731
That and I don't believe
he'll turn over the report.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.689
Hey.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.692
You guys with <i>
- The Daily Alaskan?
- Yeah.</i>

10:49.736 --> 10:53.653
Sylvie asked us to take you to
the tundra and then Skeeter's.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.007
âª Kisumi takuvit

11:00.050 --> 11:01.748
âª Ivvi nunangani

11:03.097 --> 11:05.360
âª Makigiaqaqtutit

11:05.403 --> 11:08.885
âª Quviasunngikkuvit

11:08.929 --> 11:13.542
âª Sapilinngillutit

11:13.585 --> 11:16.371
The hunters, they found her
under that boat.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.115
You find a young woman's
battered body under a boat

11:21.158 --> 11:23.160
and you don't suspect
foul play?

11:39.916 --> 11:42.397
Eileen?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.312
Eileen!

11:44.355 --> 11:46.531
You okay?

11:46.575 --> 11:49.099
Yeah.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.971
You sure?

11:58.108 --> 11:59.457
There would have been
three feet of snow on the ground

11:59.501 --> 12:02.504
the night she went missing.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.985
What do you think?

12:05.028 --> 12:07.335
I think I'm angry.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.989
Good.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.599
I've been angry
for a long time.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.524
This is it.
Skeeter's house.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.613
Thanks, guys.
We can take it from here.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.356
Am I missing something?

12:28.399 --> 12:30.532
Like Skeeter's house?

12:30.575 --> 12:32.664
There was a house here.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.928
Probably got moved.
It happens a lot.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.234
Building supplies are hard
to get up here,

12:37.278 --> 12:41.412
so when people gotta move...

12:41.456 --> 12:43.240
They take their house.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.199
Let's see what
the neighbors know.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.505
Thank God they took
that house away.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.203
The noise they made.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.379
There was parties there
all hours of the night.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.728
Did you ever complain?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.730
Sure.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.471
They didn't care.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.994
Neither did the cops.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.517
Never came out once.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.737
That house was
Dot Redding's house.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.043
Quiet lady.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.785
Secretary at the Presbyterian
church for years.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.003
But then she went
to a nursing home,

13:07.047 --> 13:09.701
left that house
to her grandson, Clarence.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.747
Clarence?
Did he have a nickname?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.923
I called him Skeeter.
We all did.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.839
- So Clarence is Skeeter?
- Yeah.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.363
Do you remember seeing
this woman hanging around

13:19.407 --> 13:22.671
Skeeter's place
about two years ago?

13:22.714 --> 13:24.455
She went missing one night.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.980
Yeah, Gloria came around.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.460
I was drunk most of the time
back then.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.375
I'm sober now.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.377
I don't remember what night
she disappeared.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.988
Did you tell the cops
you saw her?

13:35.031 --> 13:36.990
Are you kidding?
You can't trust those guys.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.515
I had a buddy-- he got busted
and the cops confiscated a pound

13:40.558 --> 13:42.952
of Matanuska Thunderfunk off
of him.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.911
A couple days later he went
to re-up, and the dealer

13:44.954 --> 13:47.261
tried to sell
his weed back to him.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.393
Same exact Thunderfunk.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.266
So the cops are selling drugs
from the evidence locker?

13:52.309 --> 13:53.745
Yeah, it's screwed up, right?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.487
Hey, check this out.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.621
Frank Moses got contributions
from these LLCs--

13:59.664 --> 14:03.494
Marlin, Doxie, and Mour--
all within the same week.

14:03.538 --> 14:04.931
Can you look them up?

14:10.545 --> 14:12.852
There's not much
about them online.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.073
But they all have
the same mailing address,

14:17.117 --> 14:20.511
and it looks like they were
all created in the last year.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.951
Oh, looks like they're all
repped by the same law firm.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.910
Which one?
Gardner and Wise.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.695
You've gotta be kidding me.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.524
That's my ex-wife's firm.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.222
Your ex-wife is a lawyer?

14:35.265 --> 14:38.573
Yeah. Don't get me started
on being married to a lawyer.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.836
I used to be a lawyer.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.534
Oh. Really?
What kind?

14:43.578 --> 14:45.014
Corporate litigation.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.323
Don't.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.542
I'm trying, but these guys
are relentless.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.892
They're called trolls
for a reason.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.241
Here.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.895
Give me your phone.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.161
Are you responding?

15:01.204 --> 15:02.814
No, I'm deleting
your Twitter.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.294
- No. Don't! Don't!
- Now, now, this--

15:04.338 --> 15:06.775
Don't do that!

15:14.783 --> 15:16.741
I didn't mean
to piss you off.

15:16.785 --> 15:20.615
But you gotta deal
with you.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.182
When I got burned out
on that Fentanyl series,

15:22.225 --> 15:24.967
I was in a dark place.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.622
I finally talked to a pro
about it, and it helped.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.363
A lot.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.408
Who'd you talk to?

15:31.452 --> 15:34.150
A counselor
at the Dart Center.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.760
They're built to help us deal
with the crap

15:35.804 --> 15:37.762
that comes with the job,

15:37.806 --> 15:41.375
be it trolls or
our own damn feelings.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.031
Two different people said

15:45.074 --> 15:47.120
the house was gone
as soon as the snow melted.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.644
That would have been
right after Gloria's death.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.254
I wonder if the cops
questioned Clarence.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.908
About Gloria?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.692
They didn't even look
into noise complaints.

15:54.736 --> 15:55.998
That's true.
We've gotta go deeper

15:56.042 --> 15:58.348
on Clarence Redding.
Roz?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.481
- Roz Friendly?
- Uh, yeah.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.573
Derek Friendly,
from Selawik.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.966
Right, yeah.
How ya doing?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.098
Don't worry.
We actually haven't met yet.

16:09.142 --> 16:12.754
I just, uh-- I can't believe
it's really you.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.191
Dad's always talking
about you,

16:15.235 --> 16:18.455
making sure we know
when you've written something.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.980
Yeah, well,
it was, uh, nice to see you.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.894
Hi, I'm Eileen. Hi.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.810
- You guys work together?
- We do.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.899
That's cool.
You guys here for a story?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.684
Yeah, but we're really busy
right now.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.120
- Sorry, Derek.
- Totally.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.992
I just wanted to say hi.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.820
If you guys need anything,
I work at the City Hall.

16:35.864 --> 16:36.996
I just do payroll,
but, uh--

16:37.039 --> 16:39.172
Okay.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.738
Uh, nice meeting you.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.481
Bye.

16:44.525 --> 16:47.397
Is he your... brother?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.573
Half brother.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.880
I thought you didn't
grow up here.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.664
I didn't.

16:59.279 --> 17:02.499
Hey. Thanks for pushing
a little later, it's been a--

17:02.543 --> 17:03.892
it's been a crazy day.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.198
Yep. Sure thing.
How's Zach?

17:05.241 --> 17:06.938
Uh, pretty upbeat.
I'll go grab him.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.897
Hey, wait, Anna. Can I pick
your brain about something?

17:08.940 --> 17:10.507
Sure. What?

17:10.551 --> 17:13.119
So I'm profiling Frank Moses
in the Senate race,

17:13.162 --> 17:14.946
and I was pulling
campaign disclosures today,

17:14.990 --> 17:18.298
and I noticed that he got a lot
of these donations from LLCs

17:18.341 --> 17:19.951
- I never heard of.
- I'm not surprised.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.736
There's literally
millions of LLCs.

17:21.779 --> 17:25.305
Right, but, um,
a lot of these particular LLCs

17:25.348 --> 17:27.916
were incorporated and repped
by Gardner and Wise.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.657
Austin.
And it turns out

17:29.700 --> 17:33.965
that LH Mining is also repped
by Gardner and Wise, so...

17:34.009 --> 17:36.446
That's privileged information.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.231
You know that.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.710
You know, I didn't like
playing this game

17:39.754 --> 17:42.539
when we were married.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.759
This kind of stuff
mattered to you

17:44.802 --> 17:46.804
when you were
a public defender.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.110
And then I got a real job

17:48.154 --> 17:50.721
because your job
wasn't cutting it.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.071
Don't start with that, Anna.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.333
I do my best
to support our son.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.638
No, I'm not saying
that you don't,

17:54.682 --> 17:56.771
but the truth is,
you're late on child support

17:56.814 --> 17:58.686
- every other month.
- You're dropping that
on me now?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.557
We've gotta think about
what's best for our son, Austin.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.822
- Daddy!
- Hey, Z-man.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.128
You ready
for soccer practice?

18:06.172 --> 18:07.434
- All ready.
- All right.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.218
Okay, give me a hug, kiddo.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.133
Mm.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.048
Bye, Mom. Bye.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.441
Ready to score
- some goals, man?
- Yeah.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.618
Damn it.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.141
I thought you weren't
from here.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
I'm not.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.753
But your brother is?

18:22.797 --> 18:24.842
Don't interrogate me.
I'm not a story.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.409
Okay.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.845
But he does work
at City Hall.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.805
- He could be helpful.
- No, he can't be helpful.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.460
He's off limits.
Got it?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.984
Got it.
He's off limits.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.291
So much for
the family reunion.

18:38.334 --> 18:42.208
According to Nexis,
Clarence "Skeeter" Redding,

18:42.251 --> 18:44.601
born June 1998.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.560
Hold it.
How'd you get on Nexis?

18:46.603 --> 18:49.476
A buddy's account--
he works at a local TV station.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.000
Clarence has no criminal cases
filed in court,

18:52.043 --> 18:55.786
no civil cases,
restraining orders, bank loans.

18:55.830 --> 18:59.094
No phone number, and the only
address is the missing house.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.449
Ma'am, this is for you.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.453
Police report.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.202
You gotta be kidding me.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.945
They redacted everything.

19:23.988 --> 19:27.383
Oh, they left in a DUI
and a possession charge.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.124
And here's their description
of Gloria--

19:29.168 --> 19:30.908
"Troubled.
History of drinking."

19:30.952 --> 19:33.346
Victim blaming. Stonewalling.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.826
This is why we can't get
anywhere with these stories.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.741
Not this time.
Durkin wants to play tough,

19:37.785 --> 19:39.178
we'll scrub him.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.005
Hey, I used to cover
the legislature.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.051
Most police departments
in Alaska

19:43.094 --> 19:45.923
submit their monthly reports
of their work,

19:45.967 --> 19:47.360
and it's all public record.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.797
Let's start there.
Review every case he's worked.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.146
See what we find.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.713
That's gonna piss him off.

19:52.756 --> 19:53.801
I'm counting on it.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.895
What do you mean
you're sorry?

20:00.938 --> 20:04.159
The police department's monthly
reports are public record.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.640
Yes, but we are
swamped today.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.514
Swamped?

20:11.558 --> 20:14.604
Yeah. Clerical stuff.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.519
Can I speak
to your supervisor?

20:16.563 --> 20:19.435
No. He's not in today. Sorry.

20:19.479 --> 20:22.221
Is anyone in today?
Just curious.

20:22.264 --> 20:26.225
Let's go.
We'll be back.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.617
I'm gonna use the restroom.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.140
I'll meet you outside.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.238
Come in.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.327
Hey, Derek.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.285
Oh, hi.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.069
I remembered you
offered to help.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.941
Sure. Yeah. Anything.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.334
Great. We're trying to get
ahold of

20:48.377 --> 20:50.031
the police department's
monthly reports.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.773
We're on deadline,
but everyone is swamped.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.514
I'm not sure if I'm allowed
to do that.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.821
Well, sure you can.
It's public record.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.606
This is
a really important story,

20:59.649 --> 21:01.695
and it would mean a lot
to Roz.

21:07.396 --> 21:08.919
Hey, Bob, you've been
around the block.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.878
Any chance you know
about these LLCs--

21:10.921 --> 21:12.967
Doxie, Marlin, Mour?

21:13.010 --> 21:14.664
Nope.
Did you look up the members?

21:14.708 --> 21:19.190
Yeah, of course. Uh, there's
Emily Sanders, Tim Brooks,

21:19.234 --> 21:20.540
John Flemming.
Wait a minute.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.890
John Flemming?
Yeah.

21:22.933 --> 21:28.069
I was just going over
the board members of LH Mining,

21:28.112 --> 21:29.462
and he's one of them.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.202
What?

21:31.246 --> 21:35.903
And so is Amelia Sanders
and Brooks.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.949
Wait. LH Mining is funding the
pro-salmon candidate's campaign

21:38.993 --> 21:40.342
for U.S. Senate?

21:42.736 --> 21:45.565
Something makes me think
he's not gonna be pro-salmon

21:45.608 --> 21:47.131
if he gets to Washington.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.875
Moses is in bed
with LH Mining.

21:51.919 --> 21:55.357
This pro-salmon candidate is
taking big money from a company

21:55.401 --> 21:58.012
that poses a giant threat
to the fishing industry.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.536
- Did you finish his profile?
- No, but this is news.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.364
We shouldn't sit on this
for a profile.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.626
Agreed.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.020
Are you sure these executives
didn't do this

22:06.063 --> 22:07.761
for any other candidate?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.458
I saw no sign of that.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.330
But you can't rule it out?

22:11.373 --> 22:14.071
They didn't give anything
to Ford.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.204
Check on
every other candidate.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.858
We need to make sure
we are buttoned up here.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.816
We have to rule it out.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.993
I'm sorry, are we pumping
the brakes here?

22:23.037 --> 22:24.604
We're doing our job.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.693
Okay, but would we be doing
this if it wasn't Moses?

22:26.736 --> 22:28.651
Austin.
What?!

22:28.695 --> 22:31.045
We know Pritchard
is backing this guy.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.829
I mean, I can't help
but to think that maybe

22:32.873 --> 22:33.874
this story is being held--You better think very hard

22:33.917 --> 22:36.703
about what you say next, Austin.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.095
Something about this
just doesn't feel ri--

22:38.139 --> 22:40.054
Austin.
Leave the room. Now.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.317
I'll handle this.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.932
I'm sorry about that, Stanley.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.282
You should have asked him
about the other candidates

22:51.326 --> 22:53.850
before you came
into my office.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.200
Austin should know better,
and, as acting editor,

22:56.244 --> 22:58.420
you definitely should.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.987
Understood.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.034
You get lost?

23:04.078 --> 23:05.775
I got the monthly reports.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.995
- How?
- I bumped into Derek.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.344
He was happy to help.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.739
What?
How could you do that?

23:12.782 --> 23:15.002
What? You're upset
that I got the reports?

23:15.045 --> 23:17.396
No, I'm upset that
you went behind my back.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.659
Give me a break.
No, I won't!

23:19.702 --> 23:23.053
You have no idea
how complicated it is for me.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.055
This isn't about you.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.188
It's about the story.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.494
That's all that matters.

23:28.537 --> 23:31.453
Is that right?
Yeah, it is.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.195
It's work. If you don't like
how I do it, then step aside.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.252
Hey.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.340
Made some tea.

23:52.866 --> 23:56.347
My dad lives in one
of the nearby villages--

23:56.391 --> 23:57.479
biological dad.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.916
Oh, you're IÃ±upiaq, too?

23:59.960 --> 24:02.484
Um, no.
He's white.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.921
Left when I was a baby.

24:04.965 --> 24:09.622
Met an IÃ±upiaq woman,
moved to Selawik,

24:09.665 --> 24:12.363
and started a whole new life.

24:12.407 --> 24:15.497
Big family.
Whole deal.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.846
You ever talk to him?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.892
No. I try to avoid him.

24:18.935 --> 24:22.461
But I ran into
one of his kids.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.680
Turns out he reads
my paper.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.465
Reads me.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.511
My half-brother was saying
that he brags about it.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.470
He's proud of you.

24:31.513 --> 24:34.342
Yeah, well, he still chose
his whole new life over me.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.871
I want to get this story right
more than anything,

24:41.915 --> 24:46.049
but working with her--
oof.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.529
She makes me feel
like a Tonto.

24:50.010 --> 24:53.970
Roz, your people
are warriors.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.582
I've never heard
of a Tlingit sidekick.

24:56.625 --> 25:01.587
She may underestimate you,
but she will learn.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.546
You are smart, tough.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.593
You care about our people.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.551
I wouldn't be helping
if you weren't on the story.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.555
Do it your way.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.348
Is that how you play?

25:25.611 --> 25:28.178
Wanna tell me what happened?

25:28.222 --> 25:30.529
I took the Moses story
to Stanley,

25:30.572 --> 25:32.922
spelled out everything
we dug up on him,

25:32.966 --> 25:34.184
and I'm not sure
he's gonna print.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.621
Why not?

25:35.664 --> 25:38.493
Because Pritchard
is endorsing Moses.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.539
I don't believe that.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.932
Believe it. He's giving me
busy work to delay it,

25:42.976 --> 25:47.023
but it's pretty clear
what's up.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.243
You know, I thought Stanley
had our backs.

25:49.286 --> 25:52.028
Silly me.

25:52.072 --> 25:54.074
Maybe she's right.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.510
Who?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.034
My ex-wife.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.470
Maybe I should just suck it up
and get a real job.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.690
This is a real job.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.692
And you're very good at it.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.302
I don't care
what your ex-wife says.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.914
Her job sucks.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.611
And I should know.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.657
I had the same sucky job.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.399
You making this
all about you?

26:18.272 --> 26:20.579
No.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.232
But maybe you're making this
about Stanley

26:22.276 --> 26:23.625
when it's really
about your ex.

26:26.062 --> 26:29.544
I hear that.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.328
I'll tell you what--

26:31.372 --> 26:34.201
You make a shot on me,
I'll stop.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.944
And you'll do
the busy work?

26:37.987 --> 26:39.293
Deal.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.821
All right, she puts
the ball down.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.214
She dribbles.
Take your time.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.346
You're not gonna get
many chances.
Yes!

26:49.390 --> 26:51.000
Thanks for seeing me
on short notice.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.436
I know you're busy.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.657
I assigned Austin
to profile Moses.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.138
He dug up some damning intel.

26:58.181 --> 27:01.707
Turns out this pro-fishing guy
is financed by mining.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.056
You have proof?

27:03.099 --> 27:04.492
Financial disclosures.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.406
Anything illegal?

27:05.449 --> 27:07.364
Uh... no.

27:07.408 --> 27:10.498
So it's politics,
not a story.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.282
Well, it's a question
of ethics

27:12.326 --> 27:17.374
because Senators help determine
land rights for mines.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.681
Yeah, but what
about the other guys?

27:19.725 --> 27:21.640
I mean, Ford's a walking
corruption case.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.903
Maybe, but not this.

27:26.427 --> 27:30.692
Frank Moses is the most
competent person in this race.

27:30.736 --> 27:33.652
It just doesn't seem like
you have much of a story

27:33.695 --> 27:35.131
to me, Stanley.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.266
I won't take any more
of your time.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.746
I'm always here.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.312
Thank you, Aaron.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.075
Roz Friendly?

28:07.729 --> 28:09.252
Yes. Hi.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.996
Asisaun, Council Chair.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.085
<i>Quyanaq</i> for welcoming me.

28:16.129 --> 28:19.132
Um, I apologize for not
coming sooner.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.658
I brought you some
nagoonberry jam.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.834
It's from my Auntie
in Yakutat.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.055
<i>Quyanaq.</i>

28:30.317 --> 28:32.667
So you're here for Sylvie, right?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.060
What can I do for you?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.453
The more we investigate
Gloria's murder,

28:36.497 --> 28:38.542
the more it points
to gross negligence

28:38.586 --> 28:40.457
in the police department.

28:40.501 --> 28:45.549
Is there anyone else that has
had problems with Chief Durkin?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.726
Someone who might be willing
to talk with me?

28:47.769 --> 28:51.251
It's pretty risky, speaking up
against the police in a village.

28:51.294 --> 28:54.907
I know. I wouldn't be asking
if it didn't matter.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.299
Let me make a call.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.634
Roz. Molly.

29:26.677 --> 29:29.680
This is Roz Friendly
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

29:29.724 --> 29:33.075
Hi, Molly. Thanks for agreeing
to talk with me.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.164
This can be all background
for now.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.166
What does that mean?

29:37.210 --> 29:38.907
It just means I--
I won't use your name

29:38.951 --> 29:40.343
when I'm writing about it.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.739
Will you tell me your story?

29:48.264 --> 29:51.877
Last year, my ex-boyfriend
beat me up real bad.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.402
I reported it, but--To Chief Durkin?

29:55.445 --> 30:00.581
Yeah. He-- He twisted it
so I sounded crazy.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.975
I had bruises everywhere.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.194
Like, what more proof
do you need?

30:05.238 --> 30:08.197
He said he needed me
to call up my ex

30:08.241 --> 30:11.853
and get him to confess
on speaker phone.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.812
I didn't want to do that,

30:13.855 --> 30:17.946
so Durkin decided
my case was unfounded.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.383
I am so sorry
that happened to you.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.168
I'm not the only one.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.170
I know a few more people
you can talk to.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.520
They never do anything.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.000
Thank you for sharing that.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.310
Oh.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.703
You can use my name.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.487
Screw him.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.282
What do ya got?

30:49.325 --> 30:50.674
You're not
gonna believe this.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.502
I went through all the records
that Derek sent over.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.896
Of all the felony complaints
to the Meade PD

30:54.940 --> 30:56.158
in the last two years,

30:56.202 --> 30:58.944
72 were for sexual assault
or rape.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.554
The cops didn't arrest
or even charge

31:00.597 --> 31:02.121
a single person
for any of them.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.600
What?
How is that possible?

31:03.644 --> 31:05.515
It's not.
Or shouldn't be.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.909
They either keep the case open
like they did with Gloria's,

31:07.953 --> 31:11.608
or, look, they dismiss it
as undetermined or unfounded.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.741
Molly's case was declared unfounded.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.091
- Who's Molly?
- I went to the Council.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.964
Spoke with an assault survivor
who's willing to go on record

31:19.007 --> 31:21.270
saying that Durkin
didn't investigate her case.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.361
Well, we just got
our lead.

31:25.405 --> 31:26.841
The cops here,
they don't investigate crimes

31:26.885 --> 31:28.147
against Native women,
which makes it look

31:28.190 --> 31:29.496
like there's no crime
in Meade.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.801
All thanks to Chief Durkin.

31:30.845 --> 31:31.585
Got him.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.939
Morning.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.636
Morning, Austin.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.378
I checked every donation,
every candidate.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.685
There's not a whiff
of any of those LLCs

31:44.728 --> 31:48.776
giving to another candidate or
anyone related to the candidate.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.212
It's all here.

31:53.999 --> 31:57.002
Okay. Good.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.048
Write it up and put all that
in the story.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.745
And we publish?

32:01.789 --> 32:02.877
Yes. We publish.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.487
Great. Okay.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.054
Thanks.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.320
Stanley...

32:11.364 --> 32:14.019
I'm sorry for popping off yesterday.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.411
It wasn't right.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.501
I let stuff in my own life
get in the way.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.373
You all right?

32:20.416 --> 32:21.548
Just gotta work
some things out.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.985
Good.
For the record,

32:24.029 --> 32:26.466
I don't mind disagreeing
about a story,

32:26.509 --> 32:28.772
but we have to give each other
the benefit of the doubt

32:28.816 --> 32:30.209
or we can't do this job.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.514
Is that clear?

32:31.558 --> 32:32.951
Very.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.564
Hey, your boss around?

32:37.607 --> 32:38.913
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.262
Whoa. Whoa.
He's not here.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.785
Okay, can you call him
for us?

32:41.829 --> 32:43.048
He's on a hunting trip.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.353
So you can't reach him?

32:44.397 --> 32:47.095
Not right now.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.576
You got an envelope?

32:49.619 --> 32:50.707
We're about to go back
to Anchorage

32:50.751 --> 32:52.709
and write a story
about your boss.

32:52.753 --> 32:57.192
He's gonna want to read this
as soon as possible

32:57.236 --> 32:58.759
so he knows what's coming.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.979
My gut is if he doesn't,
he's not gonna be happy.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.081
<i>Quyanaq.</i>

33:18.822 --> 33:20.911
What'd you write
on the note?

33:20.955 --> 33:22.391
"See you soon."

33:24.219 --> 33:26.526
There goes the messenger.

33:51.159 --> 33:54.032
You get our note?

33:54.075 --> 33:55.729
Chief Durkin:
Pretty clever.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.426
There are allegations that
confiscated drugs

33:57.470 --> 34:00.125
from your evidence locker
are being resold on the street.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.735
Nice truck, by the way.

34:04.607 --> 34:07.001
You have proof
of these allegations?

34:07.045 --> 34:08.785
No. Just a fun fact.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.397
But we are running with
a story about your record.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.312
<i>My</i> record?

34:13.355 --> 34:15.923
Well, what about your record?

34:15.966 --> 34:19.492
Yeah, I've been doing
some reading.

34:19.535 --> 34:22.538
You were, uh,
run out of New York

34:22.582 --> 34:26.716
and sentenced to Alaska
because you were wrong.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.370
My record is clean
as a whistle.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.069
Your record is perfect,
in fact.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.637
72 felony complaints
and not one charge.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.075
Yeah, well, I stand
by my record and reputation.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.424
Now, is there anything else?
Because I really need

34:38.467 --> 34:40.252
- to get going.
- No, actually,

34:40.295 --> 34:42.167
I'm curious how your office
determined no foul play

34:42.210 --> 34:45.344
after seeing Gloria Nanmac's
coroner's report.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.260
Orbital fracture,
lacerations, contusions--

34:48.303 --> 34:50.218
basically,
wounds on both the front

34:50.262 --> 34:52.090
and the back of her head.

34:52.133 --> 34:56.137
Do you have a theory
on how she did this to herself?

34:56.181 --> 34:58.226
Hey, why don't you, uh,
give me a minute alone

34:58.270 --> 35:00.663
- with your boss here?
- I'm not her boss.
We're partners.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.100
Why aren't you investigating
violent crimes

35:02.143 --> 35:05.190
against native women?

35:05.233 --> 35:09.368
Well, because I don't like to
waste my time or anyone else's.

35:09.411 --> 35:14.242
So I'm not gonna tie up
the courts

35:14.286 --> 35:15.983
with that kind of nonsense.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.680
Nonsense?

35:17.724 --> 35:20.161
Yeah. You know, native girls who
can't handle their alcohol.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.729
You really think
that's all it's about?

35:22.772 --> 35:25.906
Look, historically,
this is the place

35:25.949 --> 35:27.734
where IÃ±upiat men used to come
to trade their women

35:27.777 --> 35:30.563
for booze and guns.

35:30.606 --> 35:33.000
It's just how they are.

35:33.043 --> 35:37.570
Wow. Your insights have been
very illuminating, Chief.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.789
Now get the hell
off my property.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.496
Did you get that?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.239
Got him.

36:00.027 --> 36:01.942
Durkin's racist quote
really connects

36:01.985 --> 36:03.465
his beliefs
to his actions.

36:03.509 --> 36:04.945
Agreed.
Durkin's going bye-bye.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.773
- Mm-hmm.
- We need another graf.

36:06.816 --> 36:09.036
On what?
Context for
the racist quote.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.820
If we don't state
that Durkin's words are false,

36:10.864 --> 36:12.648
we'll just perpetuate
the racist myth.

36:12.692 --> 36:13.997
Yeah, you might be right.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.390
She is right.

36:15.434 --> 36:16.435
Right up a new graf
and drop it in.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.176
Then we publish.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.829
Sounds good to me.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.570
I'm gonna add a tip line
at the end of the article.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.356
My gut is, once people read it,
they'll want to reach out.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.531
You got someone to sift
through the cranks?

36:25.574 --> 36:27.402
Gabriel will do it.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.012
This is good reporting.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.710
Good work, team.

36:30.753 --> 36:33.582
- Agreed.
- Agreed. Just one thing.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.018
You may not
want to admit it,

36:35.062 --> 36:36.803
but you need me
on this investigation.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.370
So I've gotta be able
to trust you.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.459
I'm not a sidekick.

36:40.502 --> 36:43.462
What you did with Derek
was wrong.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.813
You do it again, I'm out.

36:46.856 --> 36:47.988
Are you giving me
an ultimatum?

36:48.031 --> 36:49.642
I am.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.253
We can get this story
without you being a dick.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.603
That seems fair.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.172
I hear you.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.478
Good.

36:59.521 --> 37:02.132
Still pissed,
but I'll take it.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.138
Just to say, no one complained
when I worked alone.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.966
At least not to your face.

37:10.010 --> 37:11.794
Gotta give her credit--
she's got guts.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.318
She does.
And issues.

37:28.202 --> 37:31.205
<i>Hi, Yuna.
I'm Kyle with the Dart Center.</i>

37:31.249 --> 37:33.338
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
You, too.

37:33.381 --> 37:36.471
<i>So I understand you're dealing
with some online hate.</i>

37:38.343 --> 37:41.824
<i>As the damage from the
LH Mining leak becomes clearer,</i>

37:41.868 --> 37:44.218
<i>a breaking story
in</i> The Daily Alaskan

37:44.262 --> 37:46.960
<i>puts Frank Moses' campaign
in jeopardy.</i>

37:47.003 --> 37:49.092
Moses is done for, anyway.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.443
Pro-mining tag
is gonna cost him his base.

37:51.486 --> 37:54.010
Gotta say,
I actually kinda liked Moses.

37:54.054 --> 37:56.448
I was pulling for him.

37:56.491 --> 37:57.710
Pisses me off.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.929
That's why we do
what we do.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.062
A guy like Moses can say
whatever he wants.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.846
Our job is to hold him accountable.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.674
And that we did.

38:05.718 --> 38:08.329
With Stanley's help.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.852
Agreed.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.898
Now, back to work.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.341
Austin Teague.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.734
<i>Austin, hey.</i>

38:21.777 --> 38:23.736
Anna. <i>
I saw your story.</i>

38:23.779 --> 38:26.216
-<i>You must be proud.
- I am.</i>

38:26.260 --> 38:29.176
<i>Look, um, I'm sorry
about our fight.</i>

38:29.219 --> 38:32.135
Everything okay? <i>
Yeah, yeah,
just, uh...</i>

38:32.179 --> 38:33.876
<i>there's--
Look, there's no easy way</i>

38:33.920 --> 38:36.096
<i>to say this,
but I got an offer.</i>

38:36.139 --> 38:37.532
<i>A huge promotion.</i>

38:37.576 --> 38:38.620
<i>Dream position, really.</i>

38:38.664 --> 38:39.969
Okay.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.580
<i>In Chicago.</i>

38:41.623 --> 38:44.191
<i>So I'm going to accept it,</i>

38:44.234 --> 38:48.978
<i>and I want to take Zachary
with me.</i>

38:49.022 --> 38:51.894
No. No.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.636
You can't just...

38:54.680 --> 38:56.682
We have an agreement.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.466
<i>I wanted you
to hear it from me.</i>

39:04.429 --> 39:06.387
Hi, Ken.
I need some information.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.389
<i>Stanley, it's been a while.</i>

39:08.433 --> 39:10.696
I'd like to know more
about the Pritchard family.

39:10.739 --> 39:13.133
<i>Pritchard,
as in your publisher?</i>

39:13.176 --> 39:15.135
<i>Does this have to do
with the Frank Moses story?</i>

39:15.178 --> 39:17.093
The Pritchards dropped
their endorsement,

39:17.137 --> 39:21.054
but I want to understand what
they stood to gain if Moses won.

39:21.097 --> 39:24.100
<i>You sure you want to go
down that road, Stanley?</i>

39:24.144 --> 39:27.016
<i>Conrad Pritchard is not a man
to be taken lightly.</i>

39:27.060 --> 39:28.931
I understand.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.498
<i>I'll see what I can see, Stanley.</i>

39:30.542 --> 39:31.978
Thanks, Kenny.
