WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:05.004
- Oh, one of my patients died.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.632
"Following complications
from surgery"?

00:07.716 --> 00:08.425
Oh, not the heart.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.884
Not the heart.
Not the heart.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.594
Oh, liposuction.

00:11.678 --> 00:15.348
Yes!

00:15.432 --> 00:18.601
I mean, poor Mr. Grimaldi.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.644
- Mr. Grimaldi?

00:19.728 --> 00:22.105
The Mr. Grimaldi
from the worst day of my life?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.440
- Who's Mr. Grimaldi?

00:23.523 --> 00:25.608
- Oh, he was part owner
of the Phillies.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.944
About four years ago,
he gave us box seats to a game.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.863
- Except I didn't get to go.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.824
- It was the best day ever!

00:32.907 --> 00:36.119
We got to go in the dugout
and meet all the players.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.245
- Not me.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.329
- And run the bases.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.372
- Not me.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.790
- And hug all the players.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.584
- Not me.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.086
I like a good hug.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.337
- Okay, I'll bite.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.630
Why not you?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.632
- Because dad
grounded me that day.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.967
- Charlie?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.594
How could you
leave James out of all of that?

00:52.677 --> 00:53.595
- I didn't know.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.221
I thought it was just tickets.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.433
Turns out Mr. Grimaldi planned
out a bunch of little surprises.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.561
- You rode in a blimp.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.146
- And one big one.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.563
- That was so unfair.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.649
- No, it was perfectly fair.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.067
You flooded the basement.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.652
- I told you, I didn't do that.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.445
- Then who did?

01:10.528 --> 01:11.488
- I don't know.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.698
Maybe one of your other kids.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.824
Have you even asked them?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.659
- No, because you were the one
that was bugging me

01:16.743 --> 01:18.286
for an indoor waterpark.

01:18.369 --> 01:22.123
Slippery James' Splash for Cash.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.875
Well, if it makes you feel
better, I'll ask them right now.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.710
Gabby, did you
flood the basement?

01:25.794 --> 01:27.253
- No, Father, I did not.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.922
- Aaron, did you
flood the basement?

01:29.005 --> 01:29.923
- Kind of.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.133
- See, James--wait a minute.
What?

01:32.217 --> 01:33.927
- Ha, told you it wasn't me!

01:34.010 --> 01:36.304
- Aaron, how could you let
James get punished

01:36.387 --> 01:37.889
and not tell your dad?

01:37.972 --> 01:39.891
- Oh, would you
look at the time?

01:39.974 --> 01:42.936
Who's driving us to school?

01:43.019 --> 01:45.271
- First, it's Saturday.

01:45.355 --> 01:49.776
Second, you flooded the basement
and let James take the blame.

01:49.859 --> 01:50.777
You're in big trouble, son.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.362
I'm very disappointed in you.

01:52.445 --> 01:56.950
- Knowing that
is punishment enough.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.577
- No, that's not remotely
punishment enough.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.037
I need to give it some thought.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.205
- You never want thought.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.958
He likes to get creative.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.209
- You can punish him
all you want,

02:06.292 --> 02:07.877
I'm never gonna
get that day back.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.420
- James, I owe you
a big apology.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.131
In fact, I owe you
a lot more than that.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.466
Tell you what.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.885
Next time you're in trouble,
I'll give you a free pass.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.554
- Charlie?

02:17.637 --> 02:20.181
- Let me get this straight.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.226
Next time I do something wrong,
I don't get punished?

02:23.309 --> 02:24.477
- That's what I'm saying.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.021
- Charlie, since I don't like
to tell you you're stupid

02:27.105 --> 02:30.775
in front of the kids, can I
see you in the living room?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.903
- ♪

02:38.575 --> 02:39.993
♪ Yeah ♪

02:45.123 --> 02:47.125

02:47.208 --> 02:49.085

02:52.297 --> 02:54.549
{\an5}- Dad, about the free pass that
gets me out of a punishment.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.134
{\an5}- [chuckles]
You need it already?

02:56.217 --> 02:57.176
{\an5}That didn't take you long.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.929
{\an5}Honey, I owe you five bucks.

03:00.013 --> 03:00.722
{\an5}- Who am I calling?

03:00.805 --> 03:02.849
{\an5}Fire, police or poison control?

03:02.932 --> 03:04.058
{\an5}- No, no, no,

03:04.142 --> 03:08.229
{\an5}I made an actual free pass,
and I need you to sign it.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.440
{\an5}- "The bearer of this
Off the Hook card

03:10.523 --> 03:16.154
{\an5}is entitled to go unpunished

03:16.237 --> 03:17.447
{\an5}Why should I sign this?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.157
{\an5}I told you I'd give you
a free pass, and I'll do it.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.826
{\an5}- You expect me to take the word
of a man who ruined my life

03:21.910 --> 03:25.997
{\an5}by cheating me
out of the best day ever?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.248
{\an5}- Fine, give it here.

03:27.332 --> 03:32.211
{\an5}Oh, look, it's got cute little
glitter baseballs on it.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.254
{\an5}- It's not glitter.

03:33.338 --> 03:37.175
{\an5}They're shiny from my tears.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.635
{\an5}- I said I'd sign it.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.637
{\an5}- Charlie, what are you doing?

03:40.720 --> 03:43.932
{\an5}- Repairing the trust
between a father and son.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.475
{\an5}I did wrong by James.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.394
{\an5}I promised I'd make it right,
and I stand by my promise.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.312
{\an5}- Thank you, dad.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.480
{\an5}Now if you'll excuse me,

03:50.563 --> 03:54.359
{\an5}I'm gonna give this bad boy
a laminating.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.693
- Congratulations, Charlie.

03:55.777 --> 03:59.906
Now your idea
is stupid and waterproof.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.616
I know you're not doing
your nails on my kitchen table.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.576
- We had to.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.079
Your coffee table's cluttered.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.705
- No, clean up that mess.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.416
This table
is very special to me.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.709
- [giggles] Special?

04:11.793 --> 04:15.088
This is where Aaron and James
hold their snail races.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.422
- Their what?

04:16.505 --> 04:17.048
- Well, I don't know how
you never walked in on one?

04:17.130 --> 04:20.426
They take like six hours.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.511
- Okay, that's it.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.513
No one is using this table
for anything.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.390
It was a big deal
when I bought this.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.849
It was the first
piece of furniture I owned

04:26.933 --> 04:30.436
that I didn't get
at police auction.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.729
- Girl doesn't lie.

04:31.813 --> 04:37.402
She slept on a dead man's
mattress 'til she was 24.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.403
Ah.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.905
All right, I will
collect the nail polish.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.864
You get the rest.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.366
- What?

04:43.449 --> 04:46.452
Nah-ah, I'm not picking up
your nasty old acrylic nails.

04:46.536 --> 04:50.039
- Fine, I'll do it...you baby.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.254
Uh-oh.

04:56.337 --> 04:59.173
Glue stuck to the table.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.633
Get me a screwdriver.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.177
- Grandma Maggie, why don't you
try using nail polish remover?

05:03.261 --> 05:06.848
- Because it will strip
the varnish clean off.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.224
- Yeah, but I don't think
a screwdriver's really--

05:08.307 --> 05:12.061
- Oh, sssh, please!

05:12.145 --> 05:15.690
Grown folks got this.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.276
Thank you.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.990
Ugh!

05:24.073 --> 05:27.160
- What you gonna do now,
grown folk?

05:27.243 --> 05:30.163
- ♪

05:35.626 --> 05:38.296
- I smell money.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.215
You didn't find that taped
in a certain air duct, did you?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.508
- No.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.385
- Under a certain brick
in Stephanie's herb garden?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.720
- No.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.973
- Under another certain brick
in Stephanie's herb garden?

05:49.057 --> 05:49.724
- No.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.435
And, dude, get a bank account.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.938
This money is mine from all
my Christmas and birthday cards.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.732
Seventy-five dollars.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.025
Is this enough
to get me to Cuba?

05:59.108 --> 06:01.444
- Why do you
want to go anyway?

06:01.527 --> 06:03.780
- Because dad's giving
me my punishment tonight.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.865
And he's been giving it
some thought all day.

06:05.948 --> 06:06.783
And so have I.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.117
It's not pretty, James.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.661
It's not pretty.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.330
- I might be able
to help you out.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.666
You can use this card, and dad
has to let you off the hook.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.126
- But dad gave it to you.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.837
- All it says is "this
card entitles the bearer."

06:19.921 --> 06:21.672
The bearer could be anybody.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.508
Anybody willing to pay.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.717
- How much?

06:24.801 --> 06:29.097
- I hear these cards are going
for about 75 bucks.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.932
- I'm not stupid, James.

06:31.015 --> 06:34.185
But I am desperate.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.562
Here you go.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.855
- Oh, look,
here's another birthday card.

06:37.939 --> 06:41.317
I still have five bucks.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.237
- Shipping and handling.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.156
- ♪

06:47.240 --> 06:48.825
- Do you really expect
Stephanie to believe

06:48.908 --> 06:50.535
this is a priceless
family heirloom?

06:50.618 --> 06:56.374
- Hey, this was the fanciest
thing at the 89-cent store.

06:56.457 --> 07:00.419
Cost me a dollar nine.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.546
- What did you do to my table?

07:01.629 --> 07:02.839
- It was Grandma Maggie!

07:02.922 --> 07:05.925
- Chill.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.261
She's talking 'bout
the tablecloth.

07:08.344 --> 07:12.265
This belonged
to your Great Aunt Bertha.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.642
And she wanted you to have it.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.561
- What did I ever do to her?

07:16.644 --> 07:17.395
- What are you doing?

07:17.478 --> 07:18.271
- Taking it off.

07:18.354 --> 07:18.938
It's ugly.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.232
- You're ugly!

07:21.315 --> 07:22.066
- What?

07:22.150 --> 07:25.653
- I mean, in your heart.

07:25.736 --> 07:29.615
It was your Great Aunt Bertha's
dying wish

07:29.699 --> 07:35.413
that you share meals on this
with your family...forever.

07:35.496 --> 07:39.500
Or at least until I tell
you you don't have to.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.711
- Nice try, Aaron,
but that Off the Hook card

07:41.794 --> 07:43.838
is for James' use only.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.465
- But I paid 80 bucks
to be the bearer.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.676
Grrr.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.637
- Okay, that's adorable, but no.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.722
- Wait a minute, Charlie.

07:52.805 --> 07:53.973
This could be good.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.267
Aaron used the card
to get out of his punishment.

07:56.350 --> 08:00.521
Card goes away,
and so does the stupid.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.689
- Stop calling this stupid.

08:01.772 --> 08:05.067
You know how many stupid
parenting things you've done?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.944
[chuckles]

08:07.028 --> 08:10.740
None, we are lucky to have you.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.868
Congratulations, Aaron, you are
now the proud of bearer

08:13.951 --> 08:15.786
of a genuine Off the Hook card.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.290
- Best 80 bucks
I've ever spent.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.960
- I'm gonna tip so many valets.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.796
- Hey, Aaron, if that card's
for sale, then I wanna buy it.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.174
- Nope, Aaron's gonna
cash his in right now

08:28.257 --> 08:30.927
to get out of his punishment
for flooding the basement.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.510
And you're lucky you have that
card, because you were gonna

08:32.595 --> 08:33.136
lose dessert for a whole week.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.431
- That was my punishment?

08:35.514 --> 08:37.015
- That was his punishment?

08:37.099 --> 08:38.683
- I'm not using the card
for that.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.144
- No dessert?

08:40.227 --> 08:41.645
Aaron, I made pudding.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.941
- Then I'll definitely
take that punishment.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.778
Pudding should be smooth.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.239
- So the Off the Hook card's
back on the market?

08:51.322 --> 08:55.451
- Can anybody use this card?

08:55.534 --> 08:59.956
Just a curious grandmother.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.667
You know, trying to get in
on the family fun.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.044
[laughs]

09:05.127 --> 09:07.672
- Man, should have thought
this through.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.800
Aaron, I'll give you
12 bucks for that card.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.010
- I just gave you $80.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.972
- Look at you
remembering things.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.016
- I'll give you $100.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.852
- What kind of trouble are you
planning that's worth $100?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.035

10:19.118 --> 10:20.536
- How can you buy him a moped?

10:20.620 --> 10:24.665

18:46.542 --> 18:47.835
- How did you steal the card
from me?

18:47.918 --> 18:48.710
- I don't have the card.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.546
Last I knew,
you stole it from Gabby.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.256
- Well, why would you
flood the basement

18:52.339 --> 18:53.048
if you didn't have the card?

18:53.131 --> 18:56.009
- An extra week
without dessert.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.137
Totally worth it.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.890
- So my daughter drags
part of my car into the house.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.143
My son drags in that thing.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.144
- She has a name.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.355
It's okay, Darlene.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.107
- And my other son
floods the basement.

19:10.190 --> 19:16.822
Stephanie, stop petting
that little horse!

19:16.905 --> 19:18.323
- I can't help it.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.868
She licked my hand.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.203
- All three of you kids
are in serious trouble.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.205
- But I had that card, I swear.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.498
- Forget about the card.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.876
I can't believe I even gave
you an Off the Hook card.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.169
I don't need
to repair your trust.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.881
You're gonna trust me,
because I said so.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.926
And from now, if dad is wrong,
we're gonna live with it,

19:38.010 --> 19:41.430
and we're gonna like it!

19:41.513 --> 19:43.891
- Charlie, deep breaths.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.559
Gabby, put the car door
in the garage.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.435
Aaron, grab some buckets
from the kitchen.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.896
James, take Darlene
to the backyard.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.814
And you and I
will braid her mane.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.608
- Stephanie!

19:52.691 --> 19:53.233
- And then we'll call somebody.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.574
- Hi, guys.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.118
Darlene.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.411
- My table.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.455
It's ruined.

20:06.538 --> 20:06.788
Who did this?

20:06.872 --> 20:09.291
- I did!

20:09.374 --> 20:13.253
But don't worry,
I know how to fix it.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.880
Ha!

20:14.963 --> 20:17.633
Off the Hook, baby.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.551
- Too late.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.094
Dad voided the card.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.846
It's worthless.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.641
- Huh?

20:25.724 --> 20:26.808
Oh.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.937
Well then, that case,
giddy-up, Darlene.

20:31.939 --> 20:35.359
