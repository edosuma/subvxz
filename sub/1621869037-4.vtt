WEBVTT

00:20.520 --> 00:22.981
[Morgan] Let me begin by thanking Sandy

00:23.064 --> 00:25.775
for asking me
to come and talk to you tonight.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.361
And while I appreciate the invitation,

00:29.571 --> 00:33.408
the only reason I accepted
was… Margaret Chen.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.579
See, I figure, if a school can turn out
someone like Margaret,

00:37.662 --> 00:40.165
with her instincts and abilities,

00:40.957 --> 00:42.792
her discipline and focus,

00:43.501 --> 00:45.086
it must be a great school.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.213
And it must have a great teacher.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.174
Oh, you're gonna make me cry.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.133
[all laugh]

00:51.551 --> 00:55.597
So… what can I tell you about acting

00:55.680 --> 00:58.016
that you haven't already heard
from this man?

00:58.933 --> 01:03.188
The best way to find out is to sign up
for my MasterClass on acting.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.149
For $90 you'll get 20 lessons

01:06.232 --> 01:08.818
dealing with everything
from character development

01:08.902 --> 01:12.739
to auditioning to dealing with directors,
voice-over work--

01:12.822 --> 01:14.449
[Sandy] Hey, hang on. Hang on.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.450
[Morgan] What?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.327
[scoffs] What are you doing?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.914
I'm telling them about my MasterClass.

01:21.498 --> 01:25.543
I also talk about what is expected of you
when you walk on a movie set.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.836
-[Sandy] Morgan.
-What?

01:26.920 --> 01:31.007
Morgan, you can't shill for your course
in the middle of my course.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.926
I mean, they pay me to teach them.

01:33.009 --> 01:38.389
And you do a wonderful job, Sandy,
but… shouldn't they have the opportunity

01:38.473 --> 01:41.309
to get the straight scoop
from the horse's mouth?

01:42.977 --> 01:46.564
-Are you saying that I'm not the horse?
-[Morgan] No, no. You are.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.358
My scoop is not straight?

01:48.441 --> 01:50.068
No. It's very straight.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.529
But… [chuckles]

01:52.612 --> 01:53.988
…I have a MasterClass.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.449
And this is a master class too.

01:56.533 --> 02:00.787
Not one that has gotten
four and a half stars from PC Magazine.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.497
[Sandy] No disrespect,

02:02.580 --> 02:04.958
but just because you've succeeded
at something

02:05.041 --> 02:06.584
doesn't mean you can teach it.

02:06.668 --> 02:10.130
So, you think someone who has failed
at something should teach it?

02:11.422 --> 02:14.509
Walter Alston played one game
in the major leagues,

02:14.592 --> 02:16.636
had one at bat, and he struck out.

02:16.719 --> 02:21.933
As the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers,
he won four World Series.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.602
So, now you are Walter Alston?

02:24.686 --> 02:27.021
No. I won a Tony. He never won a Tony.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.692
Are you saying you wouldn't want
a golf lesson from Tiger Woods?

02:30.775 --> 02:33.653
I'm telling you I would rather get
a lesson from his father,

02:33.736 --> 02:35.155
the guy that taught him.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.657
So my years of experience have no value?

02:37.740 --> 02:41.578
No, no. I'm just saying
success doesn't make you a good teacher.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.872
Being able to instruct, inspire,

02:43.955 --> 02:46.374
and motivate people,
that's what makes you a good teacher.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.584
[Margaret] I have a question!

02:47.667 --> 02:51.212
Instead of arguing, maybe you guys
could do something together?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.047
Maybe some improv?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.926
[chuckles]
What do you think we've been doing?

02:57.010 --> 03:00.180
-[Sandy chuckles] You feel like we got it?
-[Morgan] I think so.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.681
And scene.

03:01.764 --> 03:02.640
[all laughing]

03:09.147 --> 03:10.940
[theme music playing]

03:15.153 --> 03:16.529
"Evan Almighty" on three!

03:16.613 --> 03:18.198
-I see me.
-Yeah!

03:18.281 --> 03:19.115
[all laughing]

03:20.366 --> 03:21.993
They're all Margaret's friend now.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.870
Yeah. Funny how that works.

03:23.953 --> 03:27.749
He's no spring chicken,
but he is still doable.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.292
Oh, Mom. [chuckles]

03:29.876 --> 03:30.877
Look at him.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.837
He's like a tall Fudgsicle.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.464
You wanna lick him all over.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.132
You got no filter, do you?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
I say what I think.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.638
If others don't like it,
they're free to say what they think.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.724
-Go ahead.
-Ugh!

03:44.807 --> 03:46.226
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.561
-[car horn honks]
-That's Martin. I gotta go.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.523
-Why didn't he come tonight?
-He, uh, had to run an errand.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.736
What kind of errand is more important
than MasterClass Morgan?

03:57.612 --> 04:00.240
-[Mindy] Where are you going?
-I'm gonna go find out.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.533
-Morgan, I'll be right back.
-[Morgan] Okay.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.493
Ugh, damn.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.119
Come on.

04:06.829 --> 04:07.664
[horn honks]

04:08.790 --> 04:12.126
Porsche 911 GT3.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.044
I can see.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.505
[engine revving]

04:19.425 --> 04:21.344
-[car door opens]
-[Martin chuckles, groans]

04:21.427 --> 04:24.097
-Go ahead. Say it.
-[Martin] Yep. I can-- Okay.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.015
-No need.
-[Martin] Little snug.

04:26.099 --> 04:26.933
[grunts]

04:27.892 --> 04:28.851
[groans]

04:28.935 --> 04:29.978
As snug as a bug.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.648
Oh, boy. Oh! Oh! Upsy-daisy!

04:33.731 --> 04:35.733
[chuckles] Okay. I'm okay. Oh!

04:35.817 --> 04:38.069
He does save money on shoes.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.405
[Martin] Whoo! Not a problem. Okay.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.658
Yeah. Just, uh, takes
a little getting used to.

04:43.741 --> 04:44.575
[taps on car]

04:46.953 --> 04:48.162
[Sandy] Can you believe this?

04:48.246 --> 04:52.834
Hundred-thousand-dollar car,
in the slow lane, under the speed limit.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.670
It's how drunks drive
when there's a cop behind them.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.672
I'm sorry.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.882
I feel like this is my doing.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.386
You're not gonna let me off the hook?

05:04.178 --> 05:05.596
Water under the bridge.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.474
[inhales] A ten-million-dollar bridge.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.768
What'd you say to him back there?

05:11.436 --> 05:15.273
I said, if he spent one more penny
of Mindy's inheritance, I'd kill him.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.482
[laughs]

05:16.566 --> 05:17.567
Very funny.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.569
That's what he said.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.821
If you spend one more penny

05:21.904 --> 05:24.032
of Mindy's inheritance,
I'm gonna kill you.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.241
[chuckles] Very funny.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.246
You need to know
I'm willing to die in prison.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.334
-[chuckles] Sandy, come on.
-I mean, I can teach acting anywhere.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
Would you feel better
knowing it's just a lease?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.631
I told the sales girl
I was a retired schoolteacher.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.050
She gave me very favorable terms.

05:42.133 --> 05:47.013
I don't care if she dipped that thing
in K-Y Jelly and slid it up your ass.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.058
That money was meant
to provide a safety net for my kid.

05:50.141 --> 05:54.896
Okay, first of all, that's
a horrible, vaguely homophobic image.

05:54.979 --> 05:58.816
Second of all, relax.
You've got nothing to worry about here.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.693
So there won't be
any more dumbass purchases?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.695
Well… well…

06:04.030 --> 06:05.448
Don't make me ask.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.367
Okay. Yes.

06:08.034 --> 06:12.455
Yes, there was also, additionally, uh,

06:12.538 --> 06:17.126
a 100-inch ultra-high-def LED TV screen
with a state-of-the-art surround system.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.546
You fucking kidding-- Are you kidding me?

06:20.630 --> 06:24.634
You got a tiny little house.
Where are you gonna put a 100-inch TV?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.970
In the home theater that I was planning
to build in the backyard.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.348
[inhales]

06:31.682 --> 06:34.560
It'll happen in your sleep, you know.
You won't wake up.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.687
Okay. Listen, I-- I--

06:36.771 --> 06:40.566
You know, everything's still in a box.
I can return it.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.402
And the home theater?

06:43.569 --> 06:45.154
Haven't even broken ground yet.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.118
Martin, this has to stop now, right now.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.911
Understood. I hear you.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.496
-I mean, do you?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.873
-There are worse things than murder.
-[chuckles] Like what?

06:55.957 --> 06:56.958
I can call your mother.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.710
I don't think you would do that.

06:59.794 --> 07:03.673
Estelle Schneider,
Sunrise Village, Scottsdale, Arizona.

07:04.215 --> 07:08.052
-How do you know that?
-Asshole, she teaches cha-cha on TikTok.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.849
I do love
that you're so protective of Mindy.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.060
-That girl is the best of both of us.
-Yeah.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.648
What? Uh, she is.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.817
Oh, I… I agree, uh…

07:24.110 --> 07:25.361
I was just thinking how…

07:25.987 --> 07:27.655
how weird it is to

07:29.365 --> 07:30.199
like you.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.117
[laughs]

07:31.617 --> 07:32.493
[both chuckle]

07:33.327 --> 07:34.620
Oh, well, uh…

07:35.705 --> 07:36.747
I like you too.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.083
Really?

07:39.709 --> 07:40.543
Yeah.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.381
I'm enjoying, uh, this, uh, time together.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.049
Good.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.302
[chuckles] Who would've figured it?

07:49.385 --> 07:52.346
Oh, the nights I laid awake
wishing you dead.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.807
I never wanted that for you.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.769
-No?
-Oh, no. Dead is dead.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.813
I wanted you to suffer.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.774
Can you be more specific?

08:03.858 --> 08:07.236
There are these diseases in Central Africa

08:07.320 --> 08:12.825
that slowly turn your internal organs
into a river of shit.

08:13.784 --> 08:14.660
Aw!

08:14.744 --> 08:15.786
Mmm.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.789
-But now we, uh… we like each other.
-Yeah.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.833
[clicks tongue] All is forgiven.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.628
No. Not all.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.590
-No?
-Oh, think about it.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.678
Okay, but, uh, we like each other.

08:32.762 --> 08:33.596
Right.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.558
-[laughs]
-[blows raspberry, chuckles]

08:37.642 --> 08:40.728
[Martin] I promised your dad
I wouldn't buy one, but you still can.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.730
What's wrong with the TV we have?

08:43.981 --> 08:45.107
It's not big.

08:45.858 --> 08:46.901
So what?

08:46.984 --> 08:49.570
Uh, hello. Big movies need big TVs!

08:49.654 --> 08:51.072
Well, hello, no, they don't.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.990
[Martin] Okay,
if you're gonna be ridiculous--

08:53.074 --> 08:56.202
-[Mindy] Will you keep your voice down?
-[Martin] This is how I whisper.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.830
-[Mindy] Why can't you just be happy?
-[Martin] I am happy.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.542
I think I've earned the right
to enjoy Lawrence of Arabia

09:02.625 --> 09:03.960
in Super Panavision.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.753
[Mindy] What's Super Panavision?

09:07.004 --> 09:09.257
[Martin] Just like Panavision,
but it's better.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.174
[Mindy] How?

09:10.758 --> 09:14.512
[Martin] What do you mean, "How?"
It's super! It's Super Panavision!

09:14.595 --> 09:15.888
[Mindy] I don't know what that…

09:16.973 --> 09:18.975
[Martin] …fantastic vision!

09:33.197 --> 09:35.241
[over voice mail]
Sandy, hi, it's Phoebe.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.077
I was hoping that you could help me out
with something.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.997
[clicks tongue]
There's a guy I owe some money to,

09:41.080 --> 09:44.584
and, um, he's getting out
of jail on Monday.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.710
-And--
-[phone beeps]

09:46.711 --> 09:47.712
Thank you, Norman.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.715
-[phone beeps]
-Hey, Sandy, it's Robbie Newlander.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.217
I've been thinking. Instead of 25 million,

09:53.301 --> 09:55.469
-how about 11,600--
-[phone beeps]

09:56.721 --> 09:59.557
-[exhales] Thank you, Norman.
-[phone beeps]

09:59.640 --> 10:02.560
Hi, Sandy, this is, uh,
Barry Levinson calling.

10:02.643 --> 10:06.272
We haven't met, but I heard great things
about you from Norman Newlander.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.650
I was very sorry
to hear about his passing.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.154
You know,
he was really one of the good guys.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.948
Anyway, I'm about to start casting
on a film,

10:16.032 --> 10:18.492
and I'm looking for a new face
that's, uh…

10:18.576 --> 10:20.244
Well, it's kind of an old face.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.873
Jesus, I hope
that's not as disrespectful as it sounds.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.667
Anyway, this is my cell phone.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.878
Give me a call, and we'll talk, okay?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.254
Thanks. Bye.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.469
Thank you, Norman.

10:40.139 --> 10:45.019
All right.
We got Jack Daniel's and Diet Dr. Pepper.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.941
[clicks tongue] This is terrific.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.610
[sighs] Thank you!

10:52.693 --> 10:53.861
[both laugh]

10:55.279 --> 10:58.157
-Where'd you come up with this concoction?
-[sighs deeply]

10:58.240 --> 10:59.200
The truth…

11:00.660 --> 11:02.620
July 4th, 1968.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.624
I'm doing acid with Leonard Cohen,
and he got crazy thirsty,

11:06.707 --> 11:08.918
so we went rummaging
through Lou Reed's kitchen--

11:09.001 --> 11:12.755
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're tripping with Leonard Cohen

11:13.339 --> 11:15.257
at Lou Reed's place?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.551
-Yeah. A… a… anyway.
-[laughs]

11:17.635 --> 11:21.514
Cross a bottle of Jack
and a can of Diet Dr. Pepper.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.057
So, we start drinkin' 'em separately.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.851
It… it's good. It's good.
Nothin' to write home about.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.853
And then I realize,

11:28.396 --> 11:30.648
"Hey, man. They're the same color."

11:30.731 --> 11:32.274
[both laugh]

11:32.358 --> 11:34.151
So your minds are blown.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.487
-Cosmic acid epiphany.
-[laughing]

11:36.570 --> 11:38.739
We mixed 'em together, took a swallow,

11:38.823 --> 11:42.326
and roared like two cavemen
who just discovered fire.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.037
-[laughs]
-Lenny wanted to write a song about it.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.789
-Lenny wanted to write a song?
-Yeah.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.458
-Thankfully, he never followed through.
-[chuckles]

11:49.542 --> 11:53.587
Otherwise, "Bird on the Wire"
would've been "Jack on a Pepper"?

11:53.671 --> 11:54.588
[chuckles]

11:54.672 --> 11:55.673
Not as good.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.175
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.386
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

12:01.887 --> 12:02.722
[clicks tongue]

12:02.805 --> 12:05.599
Ah. So, enough
about why I can't remember the '60s.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.517
Yeah?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.770
Tell me about, uh, you and Norman.
Was he your agent?

12:09.854 --> 12:12.815
No, no, no. When I first came out to LA,
you know, I didn't know

12:12.898 --> 12:15.109
what I was gonna do,
and we ran into one another,

12:15.192 --> 12:17.278
and, over the years,
we just stayed in touch.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.573
[clicks tongue] You know,
Norman was your biggest fan.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.450
[chuckles]

12:22.950 --> 12:24.160
Why would I know that?

12:25.035 --> 12:25.995
Never told you?

12:26.662 --> 12:28.080
[inhales deeply] No.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.207
Huh. [groans]

12:30.291 --> 12:33.836
[clicks tongue, inhales] So, Barry,
what's… what's your movie about?

12:33.919 --> 12:36.380
[clicks tongue]
Well, I've been negotiating

12:36.464 --> 12:37.965
with the Hemingway estate.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.093
[clicks tongue] Finally, I got the rights

12:41.719 --> 12:43.888
to do a remake of The Old Man and the Sea.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.765
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.683
-And you want me to play the sea?
-[chuckles]

12:47.767 --> 12:50.644
-Norman warned me about you.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.604
[Barry laughs]

12:51.687 --> 12:55.024
But the sea, uh, is a costar.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.568
Sort of a living entity.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.153
Uh, h… how do you mean?

12:59.236 --> 13:03.449
Well, you know, back in the day
when Spencer Tracy did the film,

13:03.532 --> 13:07.077
you know, the ocean sequences,
to be honest with you, looked very fake.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.288
But with the CGI we have nowadays,

13:09.830 --> 13:11.457
we can make that very realistic.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.503
So, if you take the marlin sequence,
if you take the shark sequence,

13:15.586 --> 13:17.588
they can be really terrifying.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.800
Ev… even with the shitty effects,
I remember loving that movie.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.510
Me too. Absolutely.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.970
[clicks tongue, inhales deeply]

13:25.596 --> 13:28.891
[sighs] I… I can't believe I'm negotiating
against myself,

13:28.974 --> 13:31.185
but why don't you want a big name?

13:31.268 --> 13:33.270
I mean, De Niro, Pacino, Eastwood?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.731
-Mmm, too familiar.
-Turned you down, huh?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.608
Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

13:37.691 --> 13:40.236
-[chuckles]
-But I gotta be honest with you.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.155
I love the idea, no disrespect,

13:43.239 --> 13:45.533
of going with a complete unknown,

13:45.616 --> 13:48.077
someone the audience
has never seen before.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.038
Wait, wait. Hold on.
I was Hippie Number Two on Mannix.

13:51.121 --> 13:51.956
[laughing]

13:52.039 --> 13:54.291
-Can't forget that, huh?
-Cannot forget that.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.672
So, you're actually offering me the part?

13:59.755 --> 14:00.714
No audition?

14:00.798 --> 14:02.967
That's right.
Let me tell you what happened.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.261
I mentioned this to Norman.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.721
Norman immediately sends me a video

14:07.805 --> 14:11.684
of you doing Death of a Salesman
at the La Jolla Playhouse.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.229
So, I watch it. I go, "Norman is right."

14:15.312 --> 14:17.481
"This guy is terrific!"

14:18.440 --> 14:20.401
-You'd be perfect for the role.
-[sighs]

14:25.614 --> 14:29.660
[sighs] I… I don't know what to say.
This is… this is just incredible.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.204
Yes, of… of course.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.290
Barry, thank you.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.958
You're gonna be great.

14:37.042 --> 14:37.877
[exhales]

14:39.879 --> 14:41.297
[clicks tongue] Toast.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.215
[clicks tongue]

14:44.425 --> 14:45.801
[sighs] To my biggest fan.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.720
To your biggest fan.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.274
Mmm, the salt?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.943
[chuckles] There's plenty of salt
on that.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.070
Well, I need more.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.284
Do I need to explain to you
what salt does to your body?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.369
Yeah, why don't you?

15:13.245 --> 15:17.583
All right. It causes the body
to hold on to more water,

15:17.666 --> 15:19.418
which raises the blood pressure,

15:19.501 --> 15:25.174
which puts more strain on the kidneys,
the heart, arteries, and the brain.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.093
And, for a man of your age,

15:28.177 --> 15:29.887
is the kiss of death.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.765
-That's pretty scary.
-Yes, it is.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.726
-Now, would you please pass me the salt?
-[both chuckle]

15:39.313 --> 15:42.191
Thank you. The kiss of death.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.780
-I will not cry at your funeral.
-[chuckles]

15:47.863 --> 15:49.657
But you're coming, right?

15:49.740 --> 15:51.992
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

15:52.076 --> 15:52.910
Great.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.162
Make sure you sit in the front row

15:55.245 --> 15:57.289
so I can see your crusty mug
from my casket.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.375
-[chuckles] You asshole.
[Sandy laughs]

15:59.792 --> 16:01.752
Hey, that's what you called me
in our wedding vows.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.213
Oh, you called me a hot bitch on wheels.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.799
-The look on your mother's face.
-[snorts, laughs]

16:08.884 --> 16:11.679
-[Sandy] Ah.
-I am just loving this.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.430
Loving what?

16:14.014 --> 16:17.184
Watching the two of you act
like an old married couple.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.191
-Way to ruin the moment.
-Yeah, nice going, Mindy.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.985
-We are not old.
-[Mindy] Oh.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.404
May I ask, how…
how long were you married?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.698
Fourteen years.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.117
Yeah, hey, wow.
That's… that's a long time!

16:33.701 --> 16:34.702
Not in a row.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.870
No. I threw him out every so often.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.747
But I kept coming back.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.793
Yes! Begging and pleading for forgiveness.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.253
Forgiveness for what?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.509
Oh. Uh, never mind, never mind.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.177
No, no. That… that's okay.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.388
-Do you mind?
-Nah, go ahead.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.305
[clicks tongue]

16:55.889 --> 16:57.641
I was not a good husband.

17:00.769 --> 17:01.645
Got it.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.862
Hey! I… I… I'm still eating.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.280
-Eat shit.
-[chuckles] Oh!

17:11.363 --> 17:13.073
Come on. Shit.

17:14.783 --> 17:15.784
[all laughing]

17:17.494 --> 17:20.372
Can I share something with you,
just between the two of us?

17:20.456 --> 17:22.291
Sure. What's going on?

17:22.374 --> 17:25.335
[sighs] I was just offered
a big part in a movie.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.088
What-- That's wonderful!

17:28.172 --> 17:29.923
Why… why would you
wanna keep it a secret?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.383
Well, it's still early.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.344
You know, don't tell people
you're pregnant till the second trimester.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.763
Okay. Okay, I got you.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.100
But it does look
like it could be the real thing.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.561
Great director. Decent budget.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.896
Nah, thanks.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.982
So, your dressing room
wouldn't be a gas station bathroom?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.358
[laughing]

17:48.442 --> 17:50.110
-You remember that?
-[laughing]

17:50.194 --> 17:52.237
Yeah. No.
I might even have my own trailer.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.280
Good!

17:54.281 --> 17:55.616
I'm happy for you.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.034
Thanks.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.245
That means a lot, hearing that from you.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.246
Well… [sighs]

18:01.830 --> 18:02.873
Sandy,

18:02.956 --> 18:05.334
I never thought much
of you as a human being,

18:05.918 --> 18:07.836
but I never doubted you as an actor.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.379
[snorts]

18:09.463 --> 18:12.216
Oh, I remember
the first time I ever saw you on stage.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.343
I was absolutely smitten.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.761
Shakespeare in the Park?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.097
Othello in blackface.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.807
[laughs] Oh!

18:19.890 --> 18:22.267
I'd like to say
it was a more innocent time,

18:22.351 --> 18:24.103
but it may have just been more stupid.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.187
Yeah.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.189
So, when does this movie start?

18:27.272 --> 18:28.190
Pretty soon.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.901
Oh, good. Then I'll get to see it.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.737
Wha… what does that mean?
Of course you're gonna get to see it.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.697
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, of course.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.700
I'll tell you something else. [sighs]

18:38.784 --> 18:42.329
As excited as I am,
I am, uh, scared to death.

18:42.830 --> 18:43.664
Why?

18:44.289 --> 18:47.584
Well, there's a distinct possibility
that I might suck.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.878
Oh, please.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.465
You know everything
there is to know about acting.

18:53.966 --> 18:58.220
How many… how many people have you taught
who've gone on to have great careers?

18:58.303 --> 19:00.055
Exactly. I'm an acting coach.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.140
Oh.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.685
Oh, so you're worried
that you're gonna prove the old saying,

19:04.768 --> 19:06.436
"Those who can't do, teach."

19:06.520 --> 19:07.354
Yeah.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.357
-That you'll be outed as a fraud.
-Yeah.

19:10.440 --> 19:15.028
A talentless loser masquerading
as a fountain of wisdom.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.780
All true. Please stop. [chuckles]

19:16.864 --> 19:17.698
Please stop.

19:17.781 --> 19:18.615
[Roz] Yeah.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.367
You know, honey.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.245
You've paid your dues.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.872
This is your turn.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.957
Kinda late for my turn.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.208
Well, who says?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.961
I don't know. A voice in my head said it.

19:31.044 --> 19:31.879
Ah!

19:31.962 --> 19:32.838
You tell

19:33.505 --> 19:35.215
that voice, next time you hear it,

19:35.716 --> 19:37.885
that your ex-wife said,
"Go fuck yourself."

19:37.968 --> 19:40.262
-[chuckles] Thank you. Thank you.
-[laughs]

19:40.345 --> 19:42.472
-Do you mind, we sit a minute?
-Yeah.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.308
[groans]

19:44.391 --> 19:46.101
-You okay?
-Oh yeah.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.022
Yeah, I'm just, uh, still jet-lagged.
[chuckles]

19:52.274 --> 19:53.108
[sighs]

19:54.109 --> 19:55.277
So… [sighs]

19:57.946 --> 20:00.532
…is this the kind of conversation
you would've had with Norman?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.701
Probably. Yeah.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.537
Although he would've ridiculed me more.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.998
-Oh, I can do that.
-Oh no, there's no need.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.000
Oh, I know where
every one of your buttons are.

20:10.083 --> 20:10.918
Yes, you do.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.296
Do you remember when you used
to have those panic attacks

20:14.379 --> 20:17.090
whenever we went to Walmart
or… or Costco?

20:17.174 --> 20:18.467
Yes, I remember.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.844
But what was that?
Some kind of agoraphobia?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.304
I… I… I… I don't know. I…

20:22.888 --> 20:26.350
Too many choices!
Too many choices! Get me out of here!

20:26.433 --> 20:29.353
-Okay. All right. You know me well.
-[laughs]

20:29.937 --> 20:30.771
Boy.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.232
[laughs] You were a mess.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.365
[Sandy] Do you remember
when I started crying in Circuit City?

20:41.448 --> 20:43.200
-[both laughing]
-[Roz] God! I do.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.078
-[rousing music playing]
-[Sandy grunts]

20:47.829 --> 20:49.414
Don't you… don't you dare.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.332
[grunts]

20:52.918 --> 20:54.670
All right, you-- All right.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.213
[grunts]

20:57.214 --> 20:58.674
[grumbling]

20:59.549 --> 21:00.425
[grunts]

21:00.926 --> 21:01.885
[gurgling]

21:04.596 --> 21:05.430
No!

21:05.514 --> 21:09.393
You will not deprive me of my victory!

21:09.476 --> 21:10.686
[grunts]

21:10.769 --> 21:13.397
You will not take my fish!

21:15.857 --> 21:17.234
[in high-pitched voice] Damn you!

21:18.402 --> 21:19.945
Damn you, devils!

21:20.988 --> 21:23.907
This fish is mine! Oh, get back!

Hello?

21:57.566 --> 21:59.318
[Mindy] Something's wrong with Mom.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.235
What?

22:00.777 --> 22:01.862
What do you mean?

22:02.738 --> 22:03.780
What's wrong?

22:03.864 --> 22:06.158
[Mindy crying] She passed out
on the bathroom floor!

22:06.658 --> 22:09.328
Oh, Jesus. Is she conscious now?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.372
[Mindy] Barely. Martin's outside
waiting for the ambulance.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.916
Okay. All right. I'm leaving now.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.085
I'll meet you at the hospital, all right?

[emotional music playing]

22:36.146 --> 22:38.315

-No.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.316
Cup of coffee?

22:41.151 --> 22:43.153
-Sandy, how about you?
-About what?

22:43.236 --> 22:46.073
-Would you like a cup of coffee?
-Uh, yeah, that'd be nice, thanks.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.115
You got it.

22:51.119 --> 22:51.995
[sighs]

22:55.874 --> 22:57.250
I don't have any money.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.255
Thank you.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.762
Who walks around
with no money in their pocket?

23:09.346 --> 23:10.305
Not now.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.354
Are you the family of Dr. Volander?

23:17.437 --> 23:19.481
Uh, yes, I'm her ex-husband.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.775
-Sorry. That doesn't count.
-I'm her daughter.

23:21.858 --> 23:22.901
Better.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.903
Were you aware that she has leukemia?

23:28.657 --> 23:29.491
No.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.454
-[doctor] It's fairly well-advanced.
-Uh, but… but treatable, right?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.790
Well, that's a question for a specialist.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.209
All we can do now
is give her a transfusion

23:39.292 --> 23:40.877
to increase her red blood cell count.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.296
That's why she had the syncope.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.174
-Syncope?
-Loss of consciousness.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.722
You know, your mom's kind of a hero to me.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.307
Really?

23:54.391 --> 23:57.894
When I was in med school, she came to talk
to us about Doctors Without Borders.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.565
After my residency,
I spent two years with that organization.

24:01.648 --> 24:05.026
Greatest experience of my life.
I'm actually thinking of going back.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.988
That's wonderful.
Thank you for sharing that.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.991
Yeah, thank you…
thank you very much. Thank you.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.327
How did you let a woman
like that get away?

24:16.204 --> 24:17.330
Um…

24:18.206 --> 24:20.292
-Well, I--
-He wasn't a good husband.

[inhales] We're close now, though.
We're… we're buddies.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.258
She's a little groggy,
but you can go see her.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.176
Thank you.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.345

24:34.848 --> 24:35.891

24:57.954 --> 25:00.582
I didn't… I didn't know how you take it,
so I had to guess.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.459
-Oh, it's fine, thank you.
-Okay.

25:02.542 --> 25:03.919
Ooh, and I got your change.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.431
Is it just me,

25:16.515 --> 25:19.684
or do we spend a disproportionate amount
of time in hospitals?

25:19.768 --> 25:20.602
Huh?

25:23.313 --> 25:25.023
Just… just saying.

Ah, hello, baby.
