00:07.500 --> 00:09.900
Call me the queen of the Welsh.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.940
I was supposed to do that
and then put it in here.

00:11.940 --> 00:13.910
Oh, shoot. I messed up.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.610
[Cliff] Anne and I
will each show you

00:15.610 --> 00:17.010
how to make ricotta gnocchi.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.850
We're gonna get saucy!

00:18.850 --> 00:20.210
Whoo!

00:20.220 --> 00:22.780
The asa is on fire.

00:22.790 --> 00:27.250
The recruit who's not
continuing on is Angie.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.060
My family sent me here
to learn how to cook,

00:30.060 --> 00:31.990
<i>and I did.</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:34.160
<i>[narrator] You're about
to enter another dimension,</i>

00:34.160 --> 00:36.360
<i>a dimension of time and space,</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:38.530
<i>a dimension of overcooked meat</i>

00:38.530 --> 00:40.100
<i>and bad knife cuts.</i>

00:40.100 --> 00:43.270
<i>You crossed over

00:43.270 --> 00:44.410
<i>Picture, if you will...</i>

00:44.410 --> 00:45.840
[recruit] Oh, that's fire!

00:45.840 --> 00:47.240
All of it,
it just disintegrated.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.410
<i>[narrator] Two master chefs.</i>

00:48.410 --> 00:51.410
This is not what I thought.

00:51.410 --> 00:52.580
<i>[narrator] Anne Burrell.</i>

00:52.580 --> 00:53.780
Yeah.

00:53.780 --> 00:54.780
<i>[narrator] And newcomer,</i>

00:54.780 --> 00:56.850
<i>Chef Cliff Crooks as himself.</i>

00:56.850 --> 00:58.620
I feel like I'm leaving
my worst nightmare right now.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.150
Okay, it's still on!

01:00.160 --> 01:03.020
<i>[narrator] who has transformed

01:03.030 --> 01:04.290

- No.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.590
<i>[narrator] to kitchen winners.</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:09.000

<i>Some are total strangers.</i>

01:10.270 --> 01:11.500
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

'Cause I'm so ashamed.

<i>Others, old friends.</i>

01:14.140 --> 01:15.500

<i>A culinary nightmare so bad,</i>

01:24.410 --> 01:26.750
- Bring the water in.
- Water, water.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.780
<i>[narrator] I can't even
do this impression anymore.</i>

01:28.780 --> 01:31.250
Ew, salmonella everywhere!

01:31.250 --> 01:32.990
I am having a heart attack.

01:32.990 --> 01:33.920

01:42.570 --> 01:46.000
- [recruit] Giddy-up!
- Oh, this looks fun!

01:46.000 --> 01:47.500
[Cliff] Yippee-ki-yay.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.570
- Howdy, recruits?
- [all] Howdy.

01:49.570 --> 01:52.610
Today we're heading
to the Wild Wild West

01:52.610 --> 01:55.640
for a good
old fashioned showdown.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.510
[imitates cowboy theme song]

01:57.510 --> 02:00.150
To kick things off,
we will be playing a game

02:00.150 --> 02:02.120
that will test your knowledge

02:02.120 --> 02:05.750
of southwestern flavors
and trivia.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.490
One recruit from each team
will step up

02:08.490 --> 02:13.190
to taste a dish
or answer a trivia question.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.000
Once a recruit thinks
they know the answer,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.500
they must grab the ingredient

02:18.500 --> 02:21.340
from your team's general store.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.840
But I hope you don't
think we're just gonna

02:22.840 --> 02:24.710
let you grab
the ingredients on foot.

02:24.710 --> 02:27.010
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

02:27.010 --> 02:29.180
[Cliff] Instead,
you'll ride these horses.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.250
[fanfare music playing]

02:31.250 --> 02:32.710
The recruit who rides back

02:32.720 --> 02:34.380
with the correct ingredient
first

02:34.380 --> 02:35.980
will earn a point
for their team.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.050
The team with the most points
at the end

02:38.050 --> 02:40.990
will take home
a special advantage

02:40.990 --> 02:43.190
for your team
in the Skill Drill Cook.

02:43.190 --> 02:44.730
All right.
All right, recruits,

02:44.730 --> 02:46.390
it's time to earn your spurs.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.730
<i>Buck up, partners.
It's time to taste.</i>

02:48.730 --> 02:51.330
Marti, Eddie you're up first.

02:51.330 --> 02:55.000
We want you to taste
the queso in front of you

02:55.000 --> 02:57.640
and identify the pepper
and then go get it.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.370
On your mark, get set, taste.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.480
Eddie,
there's a new sheriff here.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.310
- Go get it, cowboy!
- Get it, Eddie, get it, Eddie!

Pepper, go Marti, go Marti.

03:08.050 --> 03:09.480
- [recruit] Come on.
- [recruit] Go, Marti,

03:09.490 --> 03:11.220
Yes, yes, go, Marti.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.750
- Oh.
- Oh, my goodness.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.660
Horse down.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.760
Marti, green bell pepper,

03:18.760 --> 03:20.230
- not correct.
- Oh!

03:20.230 --> 03:23.630
- Eddie, poblano is correct.
- Yes.

03:23.630 --> 03:25.370
- [cheering]
- You're a good horse.

03:25.370 --> 03:27.200
Kara and Peachez.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.400
[Cliff] Please identify
the herb in this guacamole.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.540
- [Anne] All right, Kara.
- [Cliff] Come on, Kara.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.140
Come on, giddy-up, giddy-up.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.610
You got it? Go, go, go, go.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.080
[Peachez]
<i>I think I have an idea.</i>

03:37.080 --> 03:38.710
<i>I jump on my trusty steed</i>

03:38.710 --> 03:41.010
and I'm galloping off
to the grocery store.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.880
Wee-hoo!

03:42.890 --> 03:47.390
Come on, come on, Kara.
Kara. Kara.

03:47.390 --> 03:49.660
- [recruit] Yes!
- All right, Kara.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.160
- I grabbed cilantro.
- That is correct.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.430
- One point for the red team.
- Yee-haw!

03:54.430 --> 03:55.700
Yeah. All right.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.330
<i>If I were in the Wild West,</i>

03:57.330 --> 04:01.470
I'd be known as
the baddest cowgirl in town.

04:04.170 --> 04:06.470
[Cliff] Al and Bianca.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.540
[Anne]
Identify the ingredient.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.180
Of course I know what this is.

04:11.180 --> 04:14.180
I eat this every day. Hello.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.880
- Hit it, girl.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.390
[recruit] Go, baby!

04:18.390 --> 04:20.550
Go, Al, go!

04:20.560 --> 04:23.890
Bianca was back first
and she grabbed a plantain,

04:23.890 --> 04:24.960
you are correct.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.590
[recruits cheers]

04:26.600 --> 04:28.130
Al, back in first gear.

04:28.130 --> 04:29.800
[recruits] Oh.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.330
Next up Marti and Peachez.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.970
- Put 'em up!
- You're going down, Mama!

04:34.970 --> 04:38.010
Meet me in the town square
at high noon.

04:39.210 --> 04:42.540
This is a trivia question,
also known as maize.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.810
Whee!

04:48.680 --> 04:51.820
[recruits cheering]

04:51.820 --> 04:54.020
The maize dance,

04:54.020 --> 04:55.820
just bring your horsey
back to the bar, honey,

04:55.820 --> 04:57.220
you didn't get it.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.860
So the correct answer is corn.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.330
- Yes!
- The score is tied.

05:03.330 --> 05:05.330
[Cliff] Marti and Cheyenne,
please tell us

05:05.330 --> 05:07.570
what kind of cheese
is in this quesadilla?

05:07.570 --> 05:10.370
[recruits cheering]

05:11.640 --> 05:13.240
[recruits] Oh!

05:13.240 --> 05:15.040
<i>I don't think
I've ever seen a cowgirl</i>

05:15.040 --> 05:16.840
<i>wear stilettos before,</i>

05:16.850 --> 05:19.910
maybe that's why she keeps
falling off her horse.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.280
- [Cliff] Cheyenne.
- Pepper jack.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.480
- Correct.
- Yay!

05:23.490 --> 05:25.190
Yay!

05:25.190 --> 05:26.750
That horse is gonna get
taken out back.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.360
[horse neighs]

05:28.360 --> 05:30.890
The winners
of this skill drill are...

05:33.260 --> 05:34.530
the Blue Team.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.760
[blue team cheers]

05:36.770 --> 05:39.430
And there could only be
one rodeo champion,

05:39.440 --> 05:40.700
and that's the Blue Team.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.340
We did it.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.340
Right before you guys ride off
into the sunset,

05:44.340 --> 05:47.870
it's time for an eggs-tra
special Skill Drill Cook.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.740
So today Anne and I
are each gonna show you

05:50.750 --> 05:53.850
how to make eggs Benedict
with a breakfast potato side.

05:53.850 --> 05:56.350
And, Blue Team,
since you won the Skill Drill,

05:56.350 --> 05:58.950
you have earned
the Poach Coach Advantage.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.950
- [whistle blows]
- Oh.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.320
This means I will be able
to assist you

06:02.320 --> 06:03.890
during the poaching process.

06:03.890 --> 06:05.260
[recruit] Okay.

06:05.260 --> 06:07.330
Yippee ki yay, Blue Team,
let's saddle up and do this.

06:07.330 --> 06:08.760
Woo! All right.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.400
Red Team, saddle up
to my saloon.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.070
I'll be showing you
how to make eggs Benedict

06:13.070 --> 06:14.500
with breakfast potatoes.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.740
Yum.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.810
I'm making a BLT eggs Benedict

06:18.810 --> 06:21.810
with a smashed fingerling
potato side.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.280
I'm getting my potatoes
going first.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.380
I'm going to season
my water a lot,

06:28.380 --> 06:30.750
a couple sprigs of thyme
in there

06:30.750 --> 06:32.550
and a couple of cloves of garlic

06:32.550 --> 06:35.990
because this will kind of
perfume my potatoes.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.590
We can go ahead
and get these guys smashed.

06:38.590 --> 06:42.000
I'm gonna spread them out
into a nice even layer,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.500
potatoes working.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.600
Eggs Benedict traditionally

06:46.600 --> 06:49.340
is an English muffin
with Canadian bacon,

06:49.340 --> 06:52.740
poached eggs,
and hollandaise sauce.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.280
The meat that I'm using
is going to be

06:55.280 --> 06:57.140
good old fashioned bacon.

06:57.150 --> 07:01.210
I'm going to cook my bacon
in the oven, some tomatoes.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.020
I'm going to slice them.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.790
I'm going to toss them
with some olive oil and salt

07:05.790 --> 07:08.690
and I'm gonna put those
on my rack and roast those,

07:08.690 --> 07:11.890
takes about
15 to 18 minutes or so.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.530
Our potato side,

07:13.530 --> 07:15.060
I'm gonna use our good friend,
the mandolin,

07:15.060 --> 07:17.530
so that I can get
nice even slices

07:17.530 --> 07:18.870
that I'm then going to dice.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.700
Oh, my gosh. Here we go again.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.910
I don't even remember
how to use it.

07:24.910 --> 07:28.210
We have diced potato, onions,
peppers, garlic.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.040
It's a one-pan dish.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.710
I want some nice color
on my potato.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.380
RTG, ready to go.

07:34.380 --> 07:35.920
All right, so a poached egg,

07:35.920 --> 07:38.290
fill it up to just below

07:38.290 --> 07:40.920
the rivets of the handle, okay?

07:40.920 --> 07:43.090
The key to being
an excellent poacher,

07:43.090 --> 07:44.830
the vinegar.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.990
We want just enough
so the water is acidulated

07:48.000 --> 07:50.800
so that when the egg
hits the water,

07:50.800 --> 07:53.400
the egg whites start
to firm up right away

07:53.400 --> 07:56.070
and make it look like a nice
little tight egg package.

07:56.070 --> 07:59.210
It's about three
and a half minutes or so

07:59.210 --> 08:00.470
to poach your eggs.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.740
My hollandaise sauce

08:01.740 --> 08:04.310
is an emulsified
egg-based sauce.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.080
Half a cup
of clarified butter, okay?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.550
Clarified butter is just...

08:07.550 --> 08:08.980
So it's melted butter.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.580
That's all it is, melted butter?

08:10.590 --> 08:12.490
You ever melt butter at home
and it separates,

08:12.490 --> 08:14.820
so all the milk solids
will settle to the bottom,

08:14.820 --> 08:16.590
on the top there's just raft of

08:16.590 --> 08:19.130
what looks like clear liquid,

08:19.130 --> 08:21.090
that's clarified butter
at the top.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.800
I'm gonna crack four eggs,
we want the egg yolks.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.330
I'm gonna add a tablespoon
of trusty lemon juice here.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.140
Now we're going
to start cooking.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.640
This, you need to watch
because the eggs will cook.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.770
If I don't agitate them,
they will scramble.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.080
More whisking? That's all
we do in this food camp

08:36.080 --> 08:37.480
is whisk.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.810
So this is gonna start
tightening up.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.580
My butter has melted

08:40.580 --> 08:42.550
and now I'm gonna start
streaming in my butter,

08:42.550 --> 08:44.920
paprika,
and set that ready to go.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.590
I'm just going
to slice my bread.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.790
I wanna toast these
in oil so you get, like,

08:49.790 --> 08:53.390
a nice oily, crispy,
crunchy bite.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.600
- See what's going on here?
- Hmm, yum.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.200
I need the I part of my BLT.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.670
I'm going to make a chiffonade
of lettuce.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.000
What's that?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.940
- Ribbon.
- Okay.

09:04.940 --> 09:08.010
I'm gonna put the lettuce
on my toast first

09:08.010 --> 09:10.810
because if I put my tomatoes
right on my toast,

09:10.810 --> 09:12.780
- what am I gonna have?
- Soggy.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.150
Soggy bread.

09:16.550 --> 09:18.950
[Cliff] I dutifully season
the breakfast potatoes,

09:18.950 --> 09:20.620
now finish it with my sauce.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.460
[Anne] My bacon,
you guys ready to try it?

09:23.460 --> 09:26.360
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Oh, my gosh. I'm starving.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.330
The hollandaise sauce

09:29.330 --> 09:30.860
takes the kick out of it
a little bit.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.130
- Yeah.
- It kind of saves you

09:32.130 --> 09:33.600
from, like, "Ooh, it's spicy."

09:33.600 --> 09:35.340
- It mutes it.
- Where's the mimosa?

09:35.340 --> 09:36.870
Where's the mimo...

09:36.870 --> 09:38.270
A-ma-zing.

09:38.270 --> 09:39.770
It's a bougie BLT.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.210
Yes, it is.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.940
So recruits,
you will have 45 minutes

09:43.950 --> 09:46.180
to put your own spin
on an eggs Benedict

09:46.180 --> 09:49.320
- and a potato side dish.
- Your time starts now.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.550
- [speaking indistinctly]
- [recruit] Go, go, go, go, go.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.150
I broke the damn eggs.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.460
No, we need at least
one of the... [groans]

09:56.460 --> 09:58.020
Work the eggs.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.290
Come here, potato!

09:59.290 --> 10:00.760
Oh, boy.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.330
With all the steps,

10:02.330 --> 10:04.260
45 minutes is not enough time.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.500
I'm just waiting
for the day they tell us

10:06.500 --> 10:09.300
there's fossils here
and we have to make

10:09.300 --> 10:11.000
the dinosaurs come back.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.470
[roars]

10:14.510 --> 10:16.640
So I'm just trying to make sure

10:16.650 --> 10:18.140
I get the cuts right.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.850
This mandolin
is fighting back with me.

10:20.850 --> 10:23.450
All I'm getting
is very thin cuts.

10:23.450 --> 10:24.880
<i>Let's hearken back
a couple weeks</i>

10:24.890 --> 10:26.290
when I showed the recruits

10:26.290 --> 10:28.150
how to use a mandolin properly.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.860
- Bianca, turn it around.
- Like that?

10:29.860 --> 10:31.190
No, angle it back.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.430
- Yes.
- Oh, I see it.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.360
The mandolin, Bianca, somehow

10:35.360 --> 10:37.760
<i>is taking you twice
as long to use</i>

10:37.770 --> 10:40.030
than if you were actually
just using a knife.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.840
So the only thing
I'm gonna touch is this down

10:41.840 --> 10:43.640
at the bottom and that's
in order to get...

10:43.640 --> 10:45.470
- Okay.
- The depth of what I want.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.470
- Should I grab another potato?
- Grab another potato.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.180
I am adding potatoes
to the list of things I hate.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.880
I hate cheese, eggs, potatoes.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.550
I hate food.

10:55.550 --> 10:59.250
I hate it. I hate it, done.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.350
I just hate these things.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.620
I am so in the lead,
I have to start all over again

11:04.630 --> 11:06.060
with the stupid potato.

11:06.060 --> 11:09.030
Stop touching
the side one, Bianca!

11:14.100 --> 11:15.770
Thirty minutes, recruits.

11:15.770 --> 11:18.970
[upbeat music playing]

11:24.650 --> 11:26.810
Oh, everybody's pretty quiet.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.580
I could hear myself thinking.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.780
For this Skill Drill,
I'm gonna try some stuff

11:30.790 --> 11:32.120
I've never tried before.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.850
I am making a breakfast sausage,

11:34.860 --> 11:38.320
eggs Benedict with
a fried green tomato bread.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.790
I like that idea. If you want,
you can use

11:40.800 --> 11:42.730
some of the sausage
fat in your hollandaise.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.760
All right, your pan seems
kind of hot to me though, hon.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.800
But I like
you're pushing yourself.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.440
Go big or go home.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.740
Whew. Bubble,
bubble toil and trouble.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.510
[laughs]

11:53.510 --> 11:55.180
Talk to me about
what you're making.

11:55.180 --> 11:58.480
I'm making
a salmon Benedict on a bagel.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.380
This is the classic
New York brunch.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.920
They're very big, so I don't
know if they're gonna go

12:03.920 --> 12:05.150
in the toaster,
so I was thinking about,

12:05.150 --> 12:06.520
putting them in the oven.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.020
This is
the biggest bagel I've...

12:08.020 --> 12:09.590
This is an eight-pound bagel.

12:09.590 --> 12:12.360
This bagel
is nine months full-term.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.060
You can cut, like, the top
and just the bottom off.

12:14.060 --> 12:15.200
Just do a thin layer?

12:15.200 --> 12:16.730
Yeah, make it much thinner.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.500
Chef Anne shows me
how to slice and dice it

12:18.500 --> 12:21.470
in the perfect way
to get it in that toaster.

12:21.470 --> 12:22.670
Make it fast.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.670
Tricks of the trade. Right?

12:24.670 --> 12:27.540
Al, you can just snap those

12:27.540 --> 12:29.240
and then they'll break
to where they...

12:29.240 --> 12:30.910
- Oh.
- Thanks for the tip.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.410
[Anne] You're welcome.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.650
Working right under
the perch is like

12:34.650 --> 12:38.720
being underneath mom's
evil eyes at all times.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.520
Al, bacon.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.260
Oh.

12:42.260 --> 12:43.590
Like she looks right through me

12:43.590 --> 12:45.530
so, I don't know. I give up.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.560
I'm gonna go more like
a traditional diner type

12:47.560 --> 12:52.170
eggs Benedict, but I am gonna
put asparagus on there, so.

12:52.170 --> 12:55.440
Well, this must be some fancy
truck stop you're going to, Al.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.070
Rawr!

12:58.110 --> 12:59.540
- Hi, Hilda.
- Hi, Chef Anne.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.870
I'd like you to really focus

13:00.880 --> 13:02.440
and get stuff done, please.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.980
Now I have to get started
poaching the eggs.

13:03.980 --> 13:06.480
I add the vinegar to the water.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.050
Wait for the water to boil.
It's not boiling.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.650
Come on, boil water, boil.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.120
Boil, boil, boil, boil.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.960
It is not enough time.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.120
I need at least two days.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.300
Boil, boil, it's not boiling...

13:24.300 --> 13:26.370
Oh, there it goes!
Okay, got it.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.370
I am making

13:28.370 --> 13:31.870
a kind of
moco loco Hawaiian dish.

13:31.870 --> 13:34.640
It's like a ham with biscuit.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.110
Bianca, you have your bread
vehicle for your Benedict?

13:38.110 --> 13:39.780
I'm sorry, chef,
I couldn't hear you.

13:39.780 --> 13:41.580
Bianca, don't get
tunnel vision with that hash.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.120
You have other elements to make.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.950
I can't hear you, chef.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.120
If a tree falls in the woods,
do you hear it?

13:56.360 --> 14:00.100
[rock music playing]

14:00.100 --> 14:01.370
Oh.

14:03.070 --> 14:05.810
[laughs]

14:05.810 --> 14:07.510
Are you poaching?

14:07.510 --> 14:10.440
[Marti] Honey,
we are poaching these eggs.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.780
Cheyenne, you're using
two hands right now. I'm so...

14:13.780 --> 14:15.450
- I am.
- Freaking excited.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.880
Thank you.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.790
This hollandaise
sauce is going great.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.190
[Cliff] Do you have
your clarified butter?

14:20.190 --> 14:21.190
[Cheyenne] Yes.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.620
Did you add it all in...
All at once?

14:22.620 --> 14:24.720
- Yeah.
- Why?

14:24.730 --> 14:26.630
[sighs] I forgot.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.700
So what can I do
to fix this, anything?

14:30.130 --> 14:31.600
Your face says no,

14:31.600 --> 14:33.630
but I'm hoping
your brain says yes.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.870
- That's completely... Yeah.
- It's gone?

14:35.870 --> 14:38.340
I have to start my
hollandaise sauce over again.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.540
<i>I scrambled the eggs.</i>

14:39.540 --> 14:40.870
<i>Doggone it!</i>

14:40.880 --> 14:42.780
You think that's crispy enough?

14:42.780 --> 14:45.180
Canadian bacon doesn't get
crispy like regular bacon.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.480
- It's more like ham. Go.
- Okay.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.780
Kara, what are you doing
with your potatoes?

14:49.780 --> 14:51.220
I was gonna take the center out

14:51.220 --> 14:52.950
and make like little skins.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.550
Don't you have some sort of
cheese over there

14:54.560 --> 14:55.560
or something?

14:55.560 --> 14:56.590
It's conchita.

14:56.590 --> 14:57.690
Pancetta?

14:57.690 --> 14:59.060
Con-con... Uh, con...

14:59.060 --> 15:00.360
- [Anne] [indistinct]
- Contija.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.160
- Huh?
- Contija, con...

15:02.160 --> 15:04.530
- Fontina?
- Contija. Contija.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.500
Well, why don't you grate
some on your potatoes,

15:06.500 --> 15:09.140
so get something potato done
and then focus on eggs

15:09.140 --> 15:11.070
- and hollandaise, please.
- Yes, Chef.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.340
Okay. Did you froth
the egg first?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.340
No.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.780
Chef Cliff, can you check
my hollandaise sauce?

15:17.780 --> 15:19.210
Because I think I messed it up.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.510
Mmm-hmm. Yup, you did.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.250
[sighs]

15:23.250 --> 15:25.250
Everyone has managed
to do the exact same thing.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.350
Everyone has added
ripping hot butter

15:28.360 --> 15:30.360
to their eggs, which is
just gonna do what?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.790
It's gonna cook the egg.

15:31.790 --> 15:33.590
Start all over again, you scrambled
the egg. That's scrambled egg.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.430
Ayayayayay.

15:35.430 --> 15:38.000
- Chef Cliff, I know is pissed.
- No.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.170
All I can do is laugh
to keep from crying.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.340
[laughs hysterically]

15:42.340 --> 15:44.270
This isn't how
this is supposed to go.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.740
They always said
hollandaise was hard,

15:46.740 --> 15:48.810
and boy, were they not kidding.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.220
We have five minutes, recruits!

15:56.220 --> 15:59.690
[rock music playing]

16:03.690 --> 16:05.690
Blue Team, don't forget
because you won

16:05.690 --> 16:06.860
the Skill Drill game,

16:06.860 --> 16:08.190
I'm your poach coach.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.030
Can I have help with my poaching

16:10.030 --> 16:12.130
as per the arrangement
of us winning?

16:12.130 --> 16:13.670
- Get out of my way.
- Now you're gonna poach.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.100
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.200
The Lord is good on this thing.

16:19.670 --> 16:21.270
Thank you, Chef.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.010
Chef Cliff,
I need help poaching my eggs.

16:23.010 --> 16:25.710
I go over whip, whip, whip,
circulate the water,

16:25.710 --> 16:27.980
drop in the eggs. Boom.
My job here is done.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.150
[Cheyenne]
Thank you, Chef Cliff.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.490
- Oh, no, it's scrambled eggs.
- Get an ice cube, where's it?

16:32.490 --> 16:33.790
Whisk it, whisk it, whisk it.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.120
Come on, Al, how's it going?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.860
Almost not quite, correct?

16:36.860 --> 16:38.460
But once you get
that drips in that's what...

16:38.460 --> 16:39.660
- Just keep going.
- We think it's going,

16:39.660 --> 16:41.160
otherwise you're just
giving yourself a workout.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.460
- Okay.
- Okay. All right, come on.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.200
Come on. Drip, drip, drip.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.530
I don't wanna arm wrestle you.

16:45.530 --> 16:46.530
I'd win.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.840
- You gotta be kidding me.
- 90 seconds.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.670
Kara, get it on the plate.
You don't have time

16:52.670 --> 16:55.110
- to screw around.
- Yes, chef.

16:55.110 --> 16:57.740
[recruit] We can't undo
what the devil's done.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.350
Stop talking and plate!

16:59.350 --> 17:03.420
[Anne and Cliff]
Five, four, three, two, one.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.180
[Anne] That's it, woo!

17:05.190 --> 17:08.720
Oh. I forgot my asparagus.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.960
Dammit.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.060
You ready to try some Bene's?

17:11.060 --> 17:12.030
Let's go eat some eggs.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.360
All right, I'm ready
for a Mimosa too, huh?

17:14.360 --> 17:16.830
Rockin' Red Stars.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.330
Al, you're up first.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.000
- Come on, big Al.
- [recruit] Big Al.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.600
I have Canadian bacon,
onions, and potatoes.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.570
[Anne] All right.

17:24.570 --> 17:26.270
Nicely poached egg.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.840
Your hollandaise sauce
is a lovely consistency.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.410
Where's the asparagus?

17:32.410 --> 17:35.450
I ran out of time,
I forgot my asparagus.

17:35.450 --> 17:36.780
Sorry, Chef.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.550
Crap, crap, crap.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.020
Kara, come on up.

17:41.020 --> 17:43.620
[Kara]
I made a fried green tomato

17:43.630 --> 17:45.760
with breakfast sausage.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.930
- Yay.
- Did you just see that?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.470
The tomatoes,
your pan was way too hot

17:52.470 --> 17:54.130
when you were frying them
so they taste

17:54.140 --> 17:56.170
a little bit bitter and burned.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.770
Talk to me about your potatoes.

17:57.770 --> 18:01.470
They are a five-star quality,

18:01.480 --> 18:03.410
potato half with cheddar cheese.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.680
I appreciate that you were
going to try to do

18:05.680 --> 18:07.480
sort of almost like
a potato skin.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.650
- Thank you.
- [Anne] Good job.

18:08.650 --> 18:09.780
[recruit] All right. Yeah.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.520
[Anne] Marti, come on up.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.260
- Look at that.
- Wait, I did it?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.660
I didn't know I was gonna do it.

18:18.660 --> 18:20.590
Is that it?
Is that a sexy runny egg?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.160
That is the sexiest runny eggs
there ever was.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.500
[makes sound]

18:24.500 --> 18:25.670
[whistles]

18:28.000 --> 18:29.900
Dill, capers, smoked salmon,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.800
all, like, goes together
beautifully.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.440
Uh-hmm.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.480
Do you need help
in the kitchen, Chef Anne?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.580
You hiring, girl?

18:37.580 --> 18:38.780
Hilda.

18:39.880 --> 18:44.020
It is Italian sausage
with mushrooms.

18:44.020 --> 18:48.020
It also has a potato salad.

18:48.020 --> 18:50.390
Sausage and mushrooms,
great combination.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.420
Let's see this egg.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.990
Oh, no.

18:52.990 --> 18:54.790
That's what
we call hard-boiled egg.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.560
I think today
probably wasn't your best.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.830
But I know
you've got that in you.

18:59.830 --> 19:00.900
Thank you.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.570
[Cliff] Eddie.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.970
We have eggs Benedict
with breakfast sausage

19:04.970 --> 19:07.740
with potatoes, orange
bell pepper, and onions.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.510
One egg is perfectly poached.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.880
The other egg is over.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.350
So timing, that was an issue.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.820
Your hollandaise,
it's just too light.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.750
- What are these burnt pieces?
- Those are the bell pepper.

19:19.750 --> 19:20.990
Everything tastes burned.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.220
<i>[Eddie] It's not my best.</i>

19:22.220 --> 19:23.660
It is what it is.

19:23.660 --> 19:24.860
[Cliff] Cheyenne.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.690
I've made eggs Benedict

19:26.690 --> 19:28.190
with cornbread chorizo.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.660
[Cliff] Your eggs
are poached beautifully.

19:29.660 --> 19:30.830
Thank you.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.060
The consistency of the sauce

19:32.070 --> 19:33.570
also is great.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.400
Cornbread was
a great out-of-the-box

19:35.400 --> 19:37.240
vehicle for my Benedict.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.010
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.570
[Cliff]
Peachez, bring me your eggs.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.410
I've made a lump crab Benedict

19:43.410 --> 19:45.180
and asparagus and potato hash.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.880
[Cliff]
Eggs are poached nicely.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.550
The hollandaise
is incredibly flavorful.

19:50.550 --> 19:52.190
[Peachez]
<i>You love the hollandaise?</i>

19:52.190 --> 19:55.320
And you should.
That was a labor of love.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.720
Thank you, Chef.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.990
[Cliff] Bianca.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.690
I am so nervous.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.960
It's canned ham and biscuits,

20:01.960 --> 20:04.460
and on the hash,

20:04.470 --> 20:08.000
I used peppers, onions,
and jalapenos.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.640
This is not a hundred percent.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.500
- Right.
- What I am upset about

20:11.510 --> 20:14.170
is the way your station
was organized.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.680
The overcooked egg
is a representation

20:15.680 --> 20:16.980
of that station.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.010
I need you to focus

20:18.010 --> 20:19.080
because you can do it.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.650
Thank you, Chef.

20:20.650 --> 20:24.020
While I appreciate
all of the hard work

20:24.020 --> 20:26.320
and the obstacles you overcame,

20:26.320 --> 20:29.720
I cannot declare best dish
for this part.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.660
So we're gonna do
better next time,

20:31.660 --> 20:33.260
- right?
- [recruits] Yes, Chef.

20:33.260 --> 20:36.730
No winner, but better
nobody wins than me not.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.630
There was one Rocking Red star

20:39.630 --> 20:43.970
who just clearly
nailed it today.

20:43.970 --> 20:45.740
- Marti.
- [recruits cheers]

20:45.740 --> 20:47.940
[Anne] Yes. Excellent job.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.840
<i>[Marti] I feel like
I just won the lottery, okay?</i>

20:52.950 --> 20:54.410
Welcome back, recruits.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.780
In the Wild Wild West,
you never know

20:56.780 --> 20:58.680
- what may come your way.
- [recruits] Ooh.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.950
Good thing I wear my good spurs.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.190
[laughter]

21:02.190 --> 21:04.160
We'll each be teaching you
our versions

21:04.160 --> 21:05.990
of a hearty
south-of-the-border favorite.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.190
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.460
What?

21:08.460 --> 21:09.860
Chile relleno.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.200
- [Mexican music playing]
- Hey.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.400
Spicy.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.400
Oh. We got this, Rockin' Red.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.570
And recruits, you're gonna
wanna turn up the heat

21:17.570 --> 21:19.770
for this challenge because
unfortunately two of you

21:19.770 --> 21:21.870
will be hitching
a ride home tonight.

21:21.880 --> 21:22.980
No.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.910
<i>[Peachez] Oh, my goodness.</i>

21:26.650 --> 21:28.280
I don't wanna go home.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.580
All right.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.450
<i>Red Team better bring
your A game</i>

21:31.450 --> 21:33.120
or bye-bye.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.390
Blue Team. Follow me.

21:34.390 --> 21:36.890
Rocking Red Stars,
step into my office.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.460
[recruits] All right.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.430
What I'm going to be
making today is

21:41.430 --> 21:45.970
<i>a chorizo and black bean
stuffed chile relleno</i>

21:45.970 --> 21:50.670
<i>with a tomatillo salsa
verde and lime crema.</i>

21:50.670 --> 21:52.270
Today I'm gonna show you
how to make

21:52.270 --> 21:56.110
<i>a chile relleno with ground
turkey and salsa roja.</i>

21:56.110 --> 22:00.680
Chile rellenos are roasted
poblano peppers.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.950
They can be filled from anything

22:02.950 --> 22:06.720
from just cheese,
to cheese and meats,

22:06.720 --> 22:09.120
and seafood, that kind of stuff.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.790
We just got these poblano
peppers on a burner

22:12.790 --> 22:16.330
and we're gonna roast them
on all the sides

22:16.330 --> 22:19.530
and then we are gonna
carefully scrape the skin off.

22:19.530 --> 22:20.930
Ooh.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.000
While that is happening,
I can start making my sauce.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.370
Plum tomatoes, half an onion,
one clove of garlic,

22:27.380 --> 22:29.380
one bunch of cilantro,
chicken stock,

22:29.380 --> 22:31.810
the pasilla chile,
it's a milder chili.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.710
It's not smoky like a chipotle.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.450
It's a little bit more floral,
but it is gonna bring us

22:36.450 --> 22:38.050
- a little bit of back-heat.
- Okay.

22:38.050 --> 22:41.450
So salsa verde,
I have tomatillos.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.860
A what?

22:42.860 --> 22:45.890
Tomatillo, they sort of look
like green tomatoes.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.960
- Thomasina?
- Tomatillo.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.630
Take the husk of the outside

22:49.630 --> 22:51.030
and we're just gonna char these,

22:51.030 --> 22:52.230
we're just gonna burn them,

22:52.230 --> 22:54.500
you guys should be
all right at that.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.270
Jalapeno, and then an onion.

22:57.270 --> 22:58.540
This is gonna take a minute.

22:58.540 --> 22:59.910
Now I'm gonna work
on my filling.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.110
I'm going to use a half
a pound of ground turkey.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.780
- [gasps] Wow.
- I'm gonna add my onion,

23:03.780 --> 23:07.610
cumin, tomato paste,
chicken stock.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.750
Cook some rice,
we have a half a cup of rice,

23:09.750 --> 23:12.720
cup of water, olive oil,
cover, low simmer, 18 minutes.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.920
- Yup.
- [Cliff] Have a cup

23:13.920 --> 23:15.420
of black bean
and a bowl ready to go.

23:15.420 --> 23:16.960
And that's waiting for our rice.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.590
After we do our chilies,
put them in a bowl.

23:19.590 --> 23:20.990
Cover these guys up.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.400
[Cliff] Covering my bowl,
trapping that steam

23:23.400 --> 23:25.330
so I can pull the skin off.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.700
[Anne] And we just let them
do their steamy goodness.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.570
[Cliff] My sauce,
putting into a blender

23:29.570 --> 23:31.200
and then you're gonna add
your sauce back,

23:31.210 --> 23:32.410
so that thickens up.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.040
[Anne] I'm gonna carry
on with my sauce.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.840
Everything's gonna
go right in my blender.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.710
The juice and zest,
I have a couple of limes.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.410
- Got you. Got you.
- Well, we just want

23:39.410 --> 23:40.950
to puree this. There we go.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.080
And then our sauce is done.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.380
We'll take a half a cup of rice.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.680
- Okay.
- That's gonna go right

23:44.690 --> 23:46.590
into our mixture
with the black beans

23:46.590 --> 23:47.850
and ground turkey.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.420
Now, you wanna be
as gentle as possible

23:49.420 --> 23:50.720
when pulling the skin off.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.920
I don't want to rip
through the pepper.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.460
Now you're gonna perform
delicate surgery.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.130
You cut a slit
into the side of the pepper,

23:55.130 --> 23:56.660
start pulling the seeds out.

23:56.660 --> 23:59.130
Now we're gonna start stuffing
our peppers. Queso Oaxaca.

23:59.130 --> 24:01.730
So there are going
to be many cheeses

24:01.740 --> 24:03.970
that a lot of you are gonna
be very unfamiliar with.

24:03.970 --> 24:06.670
Taste them so that you know
what direction you wanna go

24:06.670 --> 24:08.240
and how they're gonna
pair together.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.910
You grab the salty,
funky, Gorgonzola,

24:09.910 --> 24:13.080
pair it with, you know, Queso
Fresco or a Cotija cheese.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.750
You do one slice per pepper?

24:15.750 --> 24:16.950
I'm probably gonna do three.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.120
You have to be careful
on how much stuff

24:19.120 --> 24:20.920
you're putting inside of this.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.960
I'm just filling the cavity,
stick a toothpick,

24:22.960 --> 24:24.560
just so it's nice
and thin and closed.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.560
For the coating,
two eggs separated,

24:28.560 --> 24:32.260
the whites
whip up to stiff peaks.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.070
[Cliff] Okay,
so it's starting to ribbon.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.070
- You see the two peaks?
- Right?

24:36.070 --> 24:37.600
[Anne] And then we take
our egg yolk.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.910
We whisk them
into our egg whites.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.070
- Done.
- So I'm gonna create

24:42.080 --> 24:43.410
a dredging station.

24:43.410 --> 24:45.010
Just flour, salt in the exterior

24:45.010 --> 24:47.350
of my pepper
right into my flour.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.480
I'm gonna coat all sides
because this flour

24:49.480 --> 24:51.320
allows the batter to stick.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.050
Peppers into the batter,
everything nice and coated,

24:55.060 --> 24:58.390
into my oil,
nice and golden brown.

24:58.390 --> 24:59.890
Let's just get our crema ready.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.360
Just gonna be a crema
and some lime zest and juice.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.130
That's all. It's really
nice and bright and creamy.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.470
Let's plate. A little bit
of my salsa verde.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.800
We're gonna lay
a chili right on there.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.970
Cotija cheese,

25:10.970 --> 25:13.140
a little bit of the lime crema.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.310
[Cliff] The salsa roja,

25:14.310 --> 25:17.540
now your roasted pepper,
and then garnish.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.680
Go ahead and give it a try.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.810
- [Cliff] Let's eat it.
- [Kara] Oh, yeah.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.380
It has so much flavor.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.120
- This is really good.
- Delicious.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.690
[Bianca] I actually like
the cheese.

25:26.690 --> 25:28.390
- What?
- [gasps]

25:28.390 --> 25:29.490
You like the cheese?

25:29.490 --> 25:31.260
I found the cheese that I like.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.490
Skies opened up.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.630
There are cartoon birds
singing song

25:34.630 --> 25:37.060
because Bianca likes the cheese.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.730
I feel like I've worked so
hard in my life

25:38.730 --> 25:41.470
- to get to this point.
- You should be very proud of yourself.

25:41.470 --> 25:43.000
He didn't make the cheese.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.670
He just gave it to you.
[laughs]

25:45.870 --> 25:47.840
For this challenge,
you will have 60 minutes

25:47.840 --> 25:50.780
to put your own spin
on my chile relleno.

25:50.780 --> 25:54.780
And replicate my salsa verde

I just wish that there was
more salt.

34:36.270 --> 34:37.600
<i>[Peachez] Let me add it now.</i>

34:37.600 --> 34:39.370
That's why they have
the shakers on the table.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.370
Just put some salt on it, Chef.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.340
Presentation-wise,
a nine out of ten.

34:43.340 --> 34:46.180
Baby. You know, I'm about
the aesthetics.

34:46.180 --> 34:47.350
[Cliff] Bianca.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.980
The filling could use
a touch of seasoning,

34:51.990 --> 34:54.050
but all the pieces are there.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.620
I'm getting the lime
in the rice.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.720
Visually, we could use work.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.460
Everything was going fine.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.460
Until the frying.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.160
It's practice, you know?

35:03.160 --> 35:05.100
Sometimes things you nail
in the beginning

35:05.100 --> 35:07.670
and sometimes things
just take a little bit longer.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.700
Thank you, Chef.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.600
[Cliff] Eddie, please join me
with your chili.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.440
- What did you make?
- A chile relleno

35:14.440 --> 35:17.710
with black beans, corn,
and pork.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.440
[Cliff] This is a very
well-seasoned dish.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.180
Why can't I get this,
like, every week?

35:22.180 --> 35:23.450
I want you
to get that every week.

35:23.450 --> 35:25.780
Should I actually
show how excited I am?

35:25.790 --> 35:27.020
That could be embarrassing.

35:27.020 --> 35:28.550
[Cliff] Cheyenne.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.620
<i>[Cheyenne] She ain't
the prettiest in the bunch.</i>

35:30.620 --> 35:31.820
<i>This dish is very burnt.</i>

35:33.390 --> 35:34.930
Tell me what we have here.

35:34.930 --> 35:38.800
Stuffed poblano pepper with
bison and pepper jack cheese.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.430
Be really careful
because I'm not sure

35:40.430 --> 35:42.430
if I got all the toothpicks out.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.100
[Cliff] Right.
She's not the prettiest,

35:44.100 --> 35:45.500
- but she's tasty.
- Oh, thank you.

35:45.510 --> 35:46.940
But it's really, really tasty.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.010
Your batter is still brown
here but then it's just

35:49.010 --> 35:50.780
dark here because it's just
pepper frying.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.380
- [Cheyenne] Yeah.
- It's just pepper.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.010
- It was just a time thing.
- Yeah.

35:54.010 --> 35:55.610
[Anne] All right.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.920
- Kara, come on up.
- Good evening, Chef Anne.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.020
One of my favorite things
my mom makes

36:00.020 --> 36:01.390
is Mexican cornbread.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.390
Black beans, ground beef, corn.

36:05.260 --> 36:08.230
I feel like the filling
is missing some seasoning.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.430
I don't feel like there's
enough cumin in there.

36:10.430 --> 36:12.400
But the texture
of your filling is nice.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.570
The fry on your pepper is good,

36:14.570 --> 36:16.540
- okay? Nice shot.
- Okay. Thank you.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.570
- [Anne] All right. Big Al.
- Hello, Chef Anne.

36:18.570 --> 36:19.670
[Anne] Hello.

36:19.670 --> 36:22.840
[Al] I put venison, bison.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.410
Where's the crema?

36:24.410 --> 36:26.040
- The what?
- The crema?

36:26.050 --> 36:28.050
The lime crema?

36:28.050 --> 36:30.250
Oh, I guess I forgot the crema.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.580
That bums me out
because what you have

36:32.590 --> 36:34.850
on your plate is good,

36:34.860 --> 36:36.450
missing a little bit
of seasoning,

36:36.460 --> 36:39.620
but again, an incomplete plate.

36:39.630 --> 36:40.990
Al.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.900
<i>[Al] It is a very good plate
of food.</i>

36:43.900 --> 36:45.460
<i>But it's incomplete.</i>

36:45.470 --> 36:46.870
Ba-dum-pum.

36:46.870 --> 36:49.130
[Anne] Marti, talk to me
about what's in your filling.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.340
Shrimp, corn, tomato,
the green chili.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.470
Yeah.

36:53.470 --> 36:55.140
[Anne]
Did you try your filling?

36:55.140 --> 36:58.440
I did a couple times and I...

36:58.450 --> 37:00.410
Nobody needs to know
that I'm panicking, okay?

37:00.410 --> 37:02.650
We're gonna be calm, cool,
and collected on the front.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.480
I like... I got it to...
I liked it...

37:04.480 --> 37:07.120
This is it, I'm out. Bye.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.490
It's done. Just going home,
pack the bag.

37:10.490 --> 37:11.590
Oh, God.

37:11.590 --> 37:14.660
[intense music playing]

37:22.340 --> 37:23.970
Did you try your filling?

37:23.970 --> 37:25.900
I did. I liked it. I...

37:25.910 --> 37:28.310
- Me too.
- Oh, good. Oh.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.740
[Anne]
Your filling is delicious.

37:29.740 --> 37:30.910
Oh. Oh.

37:30.910 --> 37:32.310
Really heavy on the lime.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.850
I added extra lime at the end.

37:34.850 --> 37:36.920
Just kidding. I didn't
do that. I didn't do that.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.250
You did do that.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.450
And don't do that.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.450
Resist the urge to throw
the last minute

37:41.460 --> 37:44.090
- stuff on there, okay?
- Yeah.

37:44.090 --> 37:45.890
[Anne] Hilda, come on up.

37:45.890 --> 37:48.760
<i>[Hilda] Walking up to Chef
Anne, my knees are knocking.</i>

37:48.760 --> 37:50.400
<i>I'm like, "Oh, my God.</i>

37:50.400 --> 37:52.730
This lady is gonna
rip me a new one."

37:52.730 --> 37:54.730
I made a grilled chicken.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.070
You didn't grill anything today.

37:56.070 --> 37:57.640
- I didn't grill anything.
- [Anne] No.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.070
Your sauce could have been
pureed more.

38:01.010 --> 38:02.740
The filling is really yummy.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.910
She might not be the prettiest
but she's pretty tasty.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.050
- Thank you, Chef Anne.
- [Anne] Okay. There you go.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.280
- Thank you, Hilda.
- You know, you scared me right.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.520
- You know you scared me.
- [Anne] That's my job.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.990
[melodic music playing]

38:18.960 --> 38:21.030
[Anne] Recruits. Whoo!

38:21.030 --> 38:22.930
This week was a doozy,
wasn't she?

38:22.930 --> 38:24.700
- Mmm-hmm.
- You've all come

38:24.700 --> 38:27.430
a very long way
in a short amount of weeks.

38:27.430 --> 38:30.700
But unfortunately,
two of you have cooked

38:30.700 --> 38:32.270
your final meal in boot camp.

38:32.270 --> 38:34.440
But let's start
with the good news.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.280
On the Rocking Red Stars,
there was one recruit

38:37.280 --> 38:40.610
who really impressed me
with their chile relleno.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.710
That recruit is...

38:45.350 --> 38:46.520
Marti.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.190
- [cheers and applause]
- Oh, Marti!

38:48.190 --> 38:49.690
[Kara] Good job, Marti.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.120
We won.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.160
[laughs]

38:54.030 --> 38:55.330
Congrats, Marti.

38:55.330 --> 38:58.030
And the recruit on the Blue Team

38:58.030 --> 39:00.000
who really pulled themselves up

39:00.000 --> 39:02.200
by their bootstraps
this week is...

39:05.070 --> 39:06.670
- Peachez.
- [cheers and applause]

39:08.140 --> 39:10.940
[laughs]

39:10.940 --> 39:12.840
I won!

39:12.850 --> 39:15.310
Baby, I won! [laughs]

39:17.480 --> 39:18.920
I won!

39:20.490 --> 39:22.020
Oh, my goodness.

39:22.020 --> 39:25.420
Also safe on the Blue Team
this week is...

39:26.790 --> 39:28.490
- Eddie.
- Thank you.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.960
- There you go, Eddie.
- [applause]

39:29.960 --> 39:32.300
But unfortunately,
that means Cheyenne

39:32.300 --> 39:33.830
and Bianca,
you are on the bottom.

39:33.830 --> 39:34.830
Please step forward.

39:35.870 --> 39:40.210
Also safe this week
on the Red Team is...

39:42.380 --> 39:43.380
Kara.

39:44.380 --> 39:47.310
So unfortunately,
that means Al and Hilda,

39:47.310 --> 39:49.680
you are in the bottom.
Please step forward.

39:49.680 --> 39:53.050
Today, you both had a couple
of stumbling blocks

39:53.050 --> 39:54.920
in the terms of seasoning.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.560
And, Al,
that incomplete plate, man.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.960
The recruit that will not
be continuing

40:00.960 --> 40:04.030
on in boot camp this week is...

40:07.130 --> 40:08.500
- Al.
- Okay.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.340
- Oh.
- It's been a great experience, though.

40:10.340 --> 40:14.010
And I loved
having you on my team.

40:14.010 --> 40:17.110
I can't believe actually
I made it as far as I did.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.640
That's how hard
I actually pushed myself.

40:19.650 --> 40:23.580
I'm leaving boot camp with
my head held as high as I can.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.220
I'm so proud of myself.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.850
But sadly, I'm gonna have
to ask you for your apron.

40:30.090 --> 40:31.660
- [Al] Can I get a hug?
- Of course.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.530
And you think I do not get one.

40:33.530 --> 40:35.430
I bet you're so excited
to go home and cook

40:35.430 --> 40:36.860
- for your wife, yeah?
- I am.

40:36.860 --> 40:39.560
My wife is gonna be tears of joy

40:39.570 --> 40:41.230
when I bust through the door.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.240
I'm gonna cook my [bleep]
when I get home. [laughs]

40:44.240 --> 40:46.040
- Hold them up, yes?
- Right.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.840
So, Bianca and Cheyenne,
obviously the batter

40:50.840 --> 40:52.740
definitely got the best
of to the both of you.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.010
Mmm-hmm.

40:54.010 --> 40:56.950
But it came down
to who executed the elements

40:56.950 --> 40:58.750
of the dish the best.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.990
On the Blue Team,
the recruit who will not

41:00.990 --> 41:03.560
be continuing on today is...

41:06.660 --> 41:07.630
Bianca.

41:08.430 --> 41:09.690
You had issues with your batter

41:09.700 --> 41:12.060
and you had issues
with your picks.

41:12.070 --> 41:15.700
<i>My family, they are going
to be very, very proud of me</i>

41:15.700 --> 41:21.540
especially, because I was able
to make it to week six.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.510
It's been a pleasure
to have you on the team.

41:23.510 --> 41:25.110
Same. Thank you, Chef.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.610
I am going to cook.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.150
I am going to do
so many yummy stuff.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.250
- [laughs]
<i>- [narrator] Next time</i>

41:34.250 --> 41:35.990
<i>on Worst Cooks in America.</i>

41:35.990 --> 41:37.460
Remote control, Chef.

41:38.820 --> 41:40.360
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.730
I have two kinds of mushrooms.
Come on, you guys.

41:42.730 --> 41:44.630
Roll with it,
Chef Anne, we're a team.

41:44.630 --> 41:46.560
An unidentified vegetable.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.630
Eddie, it's not a UFO
on the plate, buddy.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.340
You can't say unidentifiable.

41:50.340 --> 41:51.740
What does it taste like?

41:51.740 --> 41:53.070
What does it taste like?

41:53.070 --> 41:54.140
I don't know.

41:54.140 --> 41:55.310
Welcome to work.

41:55.310 --> 41:57.340
[makes noise]
