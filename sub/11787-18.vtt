NIKITA: People I used to work for,
they're Division.

I could tell you what they were planning.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.711
NIKITA: We discovered the location
of a black box.

It contains every job Division's done.

Guarded by one of Division '3 deadliest.

-Yes.

And l have a signal jammer.

that wouldn't arouse suspicion.

-Nikita, I'm serious.

Yes, I know.

Very serious.
Michael is always so serious, Michael.

-Not now.

right now.

any big surprises.

Wait, wait, wait.

-Drop your gun.
-Drop yours.

are you doing here?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.774
Well, I came to talk to you.
What's he doing here?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.324
He's with me.

Both of you, put your weapons down.

Down, boys, now.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.165

02:08.337 --> 02:10.749
-What are you doing here?
OWEN: What we talked about.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.710
-Find the black box and the guardian.
-We talked about that three months ago.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.922
-We talked about the guardian in London.
-But I was just there.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.463
l narrowed the guardian's location
to a specific borough.

02:21.642 --> 02:26.056
The guardian is an agent
whose sole job is to remain invisible.

In a haystack of what,
8 million people...

02:28.607 --> 02:31.644
...and you were able to find out
where he was in three months?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.604
Michael, please.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.237
When we talked, we also said that
you would call if you found anything.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.443
-You didn't have to come here.
-Call? Call?

02:39.618 --> 02:40.983
On an unsecure line?

02:41.745 --> 02:45.112
Come on, no. Not when I'm so close.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.741

He's on our side now.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.007
-Yeah, I can see that.
-Shut up.

Listen to me, both of you.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.629
Michael, Owen's gotten us close.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.594
You can bring this home.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.633
Get us the name of the guardian.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.223
-I can't.
-Yes.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.060
You have top-level access
higher than Alex has ever had.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.192
You are the break
that we've been waiting for.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.029
This is how we bring Percy down.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.283
Okay, while I'm bringing this home,
what are you gonna do?

03:27.791 --> 03:30.123
We'll be on site, waiting for your call.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.456
Once you get us the location
of the guardian, we'll strike.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.254
So you're gonna be in London

-She's bossy like that. You'll learn.

Not really, though that does sound
like a good time.

05:59.943 --> 06:03.231

BIRKHOFF: Problem on Emerald Eagle.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.896

gone sideways.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.613
-That's what we'd like to find out.
BIRKHOFF: Should've been an easy in-out.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.905
But a couple of overachieving
security guards decided to play hero.

You want me to debrief Jaden?

06:47.282 --> 06:50.615

-Nothing.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.958
This is how I narrowed it down
to Camden.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.999
A guardian has certain requirements.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.210
Easy access to public transportation...

07:48.385 --> 07:51.172
...proximity to secure vaults...

07:51.346 --> 07:55.680
...strong satellite signal coverage,
and multiple exfil routes.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.011
That alone eliminated big chunks
of the city.

about pounding the pavement.

was to stake out all the banks...

09:05.712 --> 09:08.419
Hoped you would just pick a guardian

09:11.468 --> 09:13.299
