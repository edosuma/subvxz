00:01.334 --> 00:02.585
DR. PORTER: <i>Wait. Wait up.</i>

00:02.669 --> 00:05.463
<i>Sometimes I wonder if it
takes more courage to live or die.</i>

00:05.547 --> 00:06.589
Stop.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.675
<i>We've all done things
to still be here...</i>

00:09.175 --> 00:10.635
I have a very important mission.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.179
I lied. I'm not a scientist.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.391
People have died
trying to get you here.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.976
<i>...things we'd like to forget.</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:24.482
<i>We became whoever we needed to be.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:27.485
I'm utterly, completely,
stone-cold, Negan.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.695
<i>But who we are now,</i>

00:28.987 --> 00:32.490
<i>the choices we make now,
maybe that's all that matters.</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:46.296
- Eugene.
- Max?

00:47.088 --> 00:50.550
- Get off me.
- Max. Max. Max.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.343
Max.

00:54.387 --> 00:58.016
- Sorry. I thought you...
- You. You're the one who killed him.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.727
- Sebastian.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.397
- We gotta get you out of here.
- No. I lost Max.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.525
- I'm not gonna leave her.
- We gotta go. Come on. Go.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.389
- We should...
- No.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.602
No one touches him.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.148
Not until I say so.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.320
I wasn't blind to who he was.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.118
In spite of what people thought,
I was trying to help.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.539
Maybe I was just too late.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.792
We had our issues,

02:51.254 --> 02:52.755
but family is a complicated thing.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.427
But you know that.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.809
Your sister was loyal to me
for over a decade.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.813
I want to think
she just lost her way.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.902
Perhaps she can be helped,

03:16.196 --> 03:17.488
before it's too late.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.908
I need an example.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.414
Someone to remind these people
that actions have consequences.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.877
If you find
and arrest Eugene Porter,

03:32.128 --> 03:34.214
he could stand
as the example to all,

03:36.507 --> 03:38.635
and we can help your sister.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.976
<i>A citywide sweep and capture
is now in effect.</i>

03:48.228 --> 03:49.270
Let's go.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.396
<i>The targets are new immigrants</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:51.981
<i>from the Virginia communities</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:55.276
<i>of Riverbend, Hilltop
and Alexandria.</i>

03:56.903 --> 03:59.280
<i>Any known associates
of Eugene Porter</i>

03:59.364 --> 04:00.907
<i>are to be brought in for questioning</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:04.619
<i>regarding the Founders' Day riot
and the death of Sebastian Milton.</i>

04:25.014 --> 04:27.433
- What do you think? It'll happen?
- I won't promise.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.768
Dude, come on.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.436
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.531
What do you think? Hunker down
and make camp, wait it out?

04:42.907 --> 04:45.743
No. We'll find a way around.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.498
Off-roading with the wagon
seems kind of risky.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.501
Besides, it's a nice day.
We're making good time.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.211
Happy to treat you all

04:55.295 --> 04:58.339
to my famous fettuccine
con cannellini beans, <i>รก la</i> Jerry.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.425
- Just saying.
- We should keep moving.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.719
What's the rush?

05:03.344 --> 05:05.972
We need to get these supplies to
Oceanside, make sure they're okay.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.892
Then get off to Alexandria.
We just don't have time to spare.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.353
Cool. Yeah.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.898
All right. Come on.

06:03.237 --> 06:08.117
Rosita Espinosa, 929 Miller Street,
Sector G4, currently unemployed,

06:08.659 --> 06:11.329
unmarried with one daughter,
Socorro Espinosa.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.749
Do you verify the information
to be true?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.042
You seriously doing this?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.295
Do you verify the information?

06:20.588 --> 06:21.839
So you don't know me,
I don't know you?

06:21.923 --> 06:23.466
We're just... We're strangers, huh?

06:24.592 --> 06:27.470
Do you verify
that this information is true?

06:29.931 --> 06:30.973
Sure.

06:34.852 --> 06:38.022
- Where were you during the riot?
- Far east end of the square.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.191
- Who were you with?
- Myself.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.653
You were with Eugene.
Several witnesses saw you together.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.406
We were. About a half-hour
before it happened.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.158
- What'd you talk about?
- Your sister.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.452
Be more specific.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.413
Eugene said
she wasn't coming with us,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.457
that she wanted to stay here,
change this place for the better.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.253
- Have you seen him since?
- No.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.964
- You sure?
- Totally.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.716
That's fine.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.344
Because at the end of the day,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.346
it's obvious where Eugene
is going to be.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.558
- Yeah? Where's that?
- With you. You're like family.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.144
Well, I'll call you if I see him.

07:21.816 --> 07:25.611
Look, Rosita, I respect you,

07:26.070 --> 07:28.364
even if in this moment
you don't respect me.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.741
But I need you
to do something for me.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.870
Tell Eugene to turn himself in.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.081
He comes to me, shows remorse
and wants to cooperate,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.376
it'll go a long way
toward helping everyone involved.

07:41.294 --> 07:46.090
But if he or you and your people
make this harder than it has to be,

07:47.592 --> 07:48.926
no one goes anywhere,

07:50.511 --> 07:53.890
and things only get worse
for all of you.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.508
It's me.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.972
How'd it go?

08:35.097 --> 08:37.934
A lot of repeat questions
and intense staring. You?

08:37.934 --> 08:39.060
Same.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.520
- You talk to the others?
- Yeah.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.355
We're gonna leave at dawn
if we can get out.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.315
All right. Mercer
is gonna be watching.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.983
I'm counting on it.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.364
Hey. How you holding up?

08:52.865 --> 08:54.534
Reckon better than I deserve.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.162
I don't suppose you have
any news on Max's whereabouts?

08:58.621 --> 08:59.914
I don't. I'm sorry.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.752
It may seem trivial, in light of
all the melee and mayhem,

09:04.752 --> 09:06.587
but I'm the one
who should truly be sorry,

09:06.671 --> 09:09.715
as my actions have put you both
in extremely compromised situations.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.218
No, don't be.
That prick had it coming.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.970
All right, what we need to do now

09:13.970 --> 09:15.388
is figure out how to get you
out of here.

09:16.013 --> 09:19.225
I know a way. The east gate.
I know when the shifts change.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.394
- Might be a window we can slip out.
- All right. Good.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.563
We can meet up with the others
on the road to Alexandria.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.855
Eugene, what's up?

09:25.898 --> 09:28.943
At the risk of sounding ungrateful
for all your efforts on my behalf,

09:30.486 --> 09:33.322
I cannot leave without my beloved.
I need to go find her.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.491
You got every trooper
in the city looking for you.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.868
- You wouldn't make it a block.
- Well, be that as it may.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.539
I cannot...
I will not leave without her.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.958
At the very least
ascertain her safety.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.087
Okay. You stay here.
I will go look for Max.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.257
If I can find her, maybe we can get
both of you out. Is that a deal?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.383
Deal.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.885
- Okay.
- Be safe.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.596
<i>Attention, my fellow citizens.</i>

09:57.138 --> 09:59.557
<i>The perpetrators of these
horrific events</i>

09:59.557 --> 10:01.642
<i>cannot be allowed to go unpunished.</i>

10:02.768 --> 10:04.270
<i>Anyone providing information</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:06.188
<i>on the whereabouts
of these individuals</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:08.441
<i>will receive a generous reward.</i>

10:09.275 --> 10:12.445
<i>While any person found aiding
and abetting these fugitives</i>

10:12.445 --> 10:17.241
<i>will share their fate,
that of swift and final justice.</i>

10:28.502 --> 10:32.798
- Maybe we leave the wagon behind?
- No. We can do this. Come on.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.509
One, two...

10:42.183 --> 10:43.225
Whoa. Hold on.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.228
Are you okay?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.148
Can he walk? Is he okay?

10:49.982 --> 10:52.777
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.238
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.910
Shit. It's my knee.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.038
Wait.
There might be a place over there.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.917
Looks like it has walls.
We gotta go on foot.

11:40.908 --> 11:41.951
Here.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.305
I'm gonna get more kindling, okay?

12:14.608 --> 12:19.822
Check it out, bro. It's big.
It's got walls, water nearby.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.411
Tons of land for farming.
Kingdom 2.0, yo.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.413
Uh...

12:27.747 --> 12:29.999
Hello? Sir Aaron?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.380
- What?
- Nothing.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.344
It'll be dark soon.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.431
I'll take first watch
so you can get some rest.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.643
- I'll stay up with you.
- Yeah?

12:49.727 --> 12:50.770
Mmm-hmm.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.772
- All right.
- All right.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.171
You always complained
that I chose this place over you.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.842
There never really was a choice.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.942
I don't know if I was ever capable
of giving you what you needed,

13:40.277 --> 13:41.320
of controlling you.

13:45.866 --> 13:50.454
And now, after all this struggle,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.166
after all our sacrifice,

14:01.423 --> 14:02.967
what are we left with?

14:08.097 --> 14:10.724
At least we don't have to
disappoint each other anymore.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.711
Take care of that.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.593
- You shouldn't still be here.
- But I am.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.178
'Cause I was ripped out
of my apartment by your guys

14:48.262 --> 14:50.806
and questioned in that stuffy room
for three hours.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.933
Smells like armpits
and ass in there.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.811
Yeah, sorry. I can't be seen
treating you any differently.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.938
Oh.

14:58.355 --> 15:02.318
- So it's nothing personal?
- We got orders.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.778
Milton's son is dead
and she wants Eugene for it.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.114
- But he's not...
- Hey, I don't have time to argue.

15:08.032 --> 15:12.244
They're gonna kill him, right?
If they catch him, he's dead.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.788
How can you be good with that?

15:16.332 --> 15:18.626
I was by myself for years,
losing my mind,

15:18.626 --> 15:20.419
scaring off anyone that came my way.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.757
But Eugene believed in me.
He accepted me for me.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.427
No judgments. He saved me.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.306
Bad people don't do that.
Good people do.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.392
He didn't know any of this
was gonna happen.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.145
But it did. You can't change that.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.898
And I gotta look out
for my family now.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.441
But not Eugene.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.861
- He'll get a trial.
- A fair one?

15:52.242 --> 15:57.164
What is the point of this place
if a good man is put to death?

15:58.457 --> 16:02.378
Sir. We've got a sighting.
Maxxine Mercer. Sector G2.

16:02.544 --> 16:03.629
Let's head out.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.591
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.428
Me too.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.483
Sure you don't wanna get some rest?

16:25.484 --> 16:26.777
You can do
the later shift with Elijah.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.903
No. No. I'm fine.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.786
Everything good with you two?
Something happen?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.042
There was just...

16:44.211 --> 16:45.379
There was a moment.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.717
It brought back memories of Henry.

16:54.847 --> 17:00.352
I don't think I can again, you know?

17:11.864 --> 17:12.906
You know, uh,

17:15.784 --> 17:17.036
I used to be married once.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.459
- Really?
- Well, not legally. But yeah.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.713
I guess I don't
really talk about it much anymore.

17:29.923 --> 17:34.386
Yeah, Eric and I, we met in D.C.,
and there was just this...

17:35.554 --> 17:40.184
instant connection, you know,
and he asked me out that night,

17:40.559 --> 17:45.481
and I said no, and I kept saying no
for the next six months.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.193
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

17:52.279 --> 17:56.408
I guess I thought I was too busy
or that I wasn't ready.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.661
Maybe I was just afraid.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.915
But eventually I said yes.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.544
And our time together,
those years in Alexandria,

18:09.880 --> 18:11.632
it was the happiest moments
of my life.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.888
You know, after he died,

18:19.181 --> 18:24.394
I thought I'd give anything

18:25.562 --> 18:27.481
to take back just one of those nos

18:28.816 --> 18:30.734
so that we could have
one more day together.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.782
Lydia, loss is inevitable.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.618
It always has been.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.834
The only thing we can control
is when we say yes.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.626
TROOPER 1: You, stop. Turn around.
Over your head.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.922
Subject has been apprehended.

19:35.757 --> 19:36.842
TROOPER 2: <i>Copy that.</i>

19:51.231 --> 19:53.692
"I, Maxxine Mercer,
am responsible..."

19:57.529 --> 20:00.490
- These aren't my words.
- They need to be.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.997
"I have suffered from bouts
of depression for years

20:06.997 --> 20:09.374
"and recently stopped
taking my medication.

20:12.461 --> 20:16.173
"In my confusion and paranoia,
I manipulated recordings

20:16.173 --> 20:19.343
"to slander the Milton family
and cause unrest.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.595
"My actions were
uncharacteristic and immoral.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.847
"I hope this community can find it
in their hearts..."

20:23.931 --> 20:27.017
Max. Just stop. Sign it.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.562
And what?
Say Eugene was behind it all?

20:31.521 --> 20:32.856
Take the pardon, Max.

20:33.690 --> 20:39.529
I did this because I couldn't stand
being a part of something so rotten.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.659
Did you know that Eugene
stopped Sebastian from killing me?

20:45.702 --> 20:47.412
You want me to
just hang him out to dry?

20:49.623 --> 20:51.416
They're gonna execute you
for treason.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.045
I'm trying to save you.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.215
I'm trying to save this place.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.511
"Speak truth, no matter the cost."

21:04.304 --> 21:05.722
Just like Dad used to say.

21:07.808 --> 21:12.479
Even as a general, he never forgot
his responsibility as a citizen.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.779
I think he would have liked Eugene.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.867
I think he would have been proud
of what we tried to do here.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.332
And I think he would
have been ashamed of you.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.854
Trying to get yourself caught?

21:56.523 --> 21:58.817
I was merely peeping
at trooper activity level

21:58.817 --> 22:01.361
so as to allow my assistance
in Rosita's search for Max.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.823
Tired of standing
on the proverbial sidelines.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.745
You'd be wise to step aside, hoss.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.498
No need for this to get ugly.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.420
Very well.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.484
Go ahead.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.713
You're not trying to stop me.

23:04.674 --> 23:05.759
You ain't going.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.443
Because I'm a coward.

23:27.406 --> 23:32.411
- No. It's because you're smart.
- I'm a liability. Always have been.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.788
Relying on others to survive,

23:34.788 --> 23:37.290
counting on their courage
due to a dearth of my own.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.252
Hell, the only way I bucked
natural selection

23:40.252 --> 23:42.087
was my penchant for prevarication.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.342
Means lying.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.178
I figured.

23:50.512 --> 23:54.641
Yeah, well, I'm ashamed to say
it's my only discernible skill.

24:01.731 --> 24:05.902
Do you think people are born brave
or do they become it?

24:10.073 --> 24:11.116
Both.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.839
- So they have Eugene?
- Yeah.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.384
Daryl and the others
are working to smuggle him out.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.554
Okay. Okay. That's good.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.473
Then he'll be out in the world,

24:34.806 --> 24:37.642
he'll hide for a bit
until the Commonwealth gets bored.

24:38.518 --> 24:41.021
We'll meet up with him,
you, me, Yumiko.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.275
Like it was,
the four of us on the road again.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.446
Princess, you know I'm not leaving.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.407
Even after what they wanna
do to Eugene?

24:52.991 --> 24:56.536
- Crazy shit is happening, man.
- All the more reason to stay.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.748
He and Max started something,
showed the truth.

24:59.748 --> 25:00.916
People want change.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.168
What better time to fight for it

25:03.335 --> 25:05.670
than when the powers that be
are frightened, huh?

25:06.087 --> 25:07.756
Well, maybe
I don't feel like fighting.

25:07.756 --> 25:12.093
Maybe this place looks all nice
and wants us to think they're cool,

25:12.177 --> 25:15.222
but really, underneath, it sucks.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.308
Maybe they're not
worth holding onto.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.192
You think this Mercer's a good man?

25:29.653 --> 25:33.156
Yeah, but I've known a lot of guys
who I thought were good men.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.992
Don't always turn out to be
that way.

25:36.660 --> 25:40.455
He and I haven't exactly seen
eye-to-eye. But I'll say this.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.084
Most folks are trying to make
the best of what's in front of them.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.920
Could be he's trying to do the same.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.425
Yeah, well, maybe this time,

25:52.509 --> 25:57.013
I deserve more than
just the best of a bad situation.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.143
Yeah, you do.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.823
And whatever you decide, I'm here.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.451
If you need me.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.796
Thank you for coming.
I hoped you would.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.384
I have a lot to say.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.680
What matters most
is that you're here,

27:20.764 --> 27:22.766
which means you want to talk
about a way forward.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.184
You killed my son.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.564
Your people murdered eight workers,

27:29.689 --> 27:32.442
turning them to rotters
and released them on the public.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.697
Okay, yes, I needed
you to understand,

27:37.781 --> 27:39.783
to get your attention.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.994
But I never intended for him...

27:48.375 --> 27:51.169
Look, I took a gamble, and yes,
it didn't go the way I thought.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.965
Sebastian and I may have had
our differences, but in the end,

27:56.049 --> 27:58.510
I was always there for him.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.346
When he needed people
for his little side projects,

28:01.346 --> 28:04.474
I helped because
he was your son, Pamela.

28:19.906 --> 28:24.285
This is because of them.
From Hilltop, Alexandria.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.622
It all started with them.
The dissent, the chaos.

28:27.872 --> 28:28.957
Unless they're handled by someone

28:28.957 --> 28:30.709
who knows how to handle them,
they won't stop.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.420
They will never stop
until they've taken everything.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.340
Okay.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.302
So then what do we do with you?

28:43.847 --> 28:47.016
Do we do it your way? Take a risk?

28:49.227 --> 28:50.270
Make a gamble?

29:08.997 --> 29:12.208
If you win, you get to live.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.503
But if you lose...

29:47.368 --> 29:50.455
Thank you. Thank you, Pamela.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.333
Thank you.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.004
I promise I'll do better
from now on.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.422
No more games, no more secrets.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.467
I am 100%
at the Milton family's disposal.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.302
I know you are, Lance.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.685
I don't understand.

30:25.949 --> 30:30.245
Like you said,
you're at the family's disposal.

30:31.871 --> 30:33.122
Thanks to you,

30:35.834 --> 30:37.293
this is all that's left.

30:55.770 --> 30:59.691
Body's still warm.
Feed my son, Lance.

31:22.755 --> 31:23.798
Can we talk?

31:24.716 --> 31:25.758
Um...

31:26.968 --> 31:28.011
Sure.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.277
This is awkward.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.406
- I don't want you to leave.
- I kinda have to.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.993
-'Cause of me?
- Yeah. No.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.622
Maybe.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.876
Look, you're great.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.129
- Really, but...
- But what?

32:03.838 --> 32:08.676
I just... I gotta get out of here.
Eugene's gonna die here.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.512
I'm doing everything in my power
to make sure that doesn't happen.

32:11.804 --> 32:15.266
But not everything. Right?

32:18.686 --> 32:20.980
It's all such a shit show.

32:21.689 --> 32:25.109
I know. This place ain't perfect.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.279
Neither am I.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.324
But you've been out there.
You've seen what's waiting.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.620
- It could be a lot worse.
- Don't. Don't say that.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.163
Well, am I wrong?

32:43.044 --> 32:45.880
I need you to understand.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.925
Nothing's been easy for me.

32:50.593 --> 32:54.138
Even before all of this,
it wasn't easy.

32:55.848 --> 33:00.937
Dad bailed when I was nine.
Mom remarried at nine-and-a-half.

33:02.605 --> 33:06.234
And dad number two
brings an evil stepbrother.

33:07.318 --> 33:13.408
And they both start acting
like they're my dad, you know?

33:14.951 --> 33:17.453
A lot of yelling, lot of shoving,

33:19.414 --> 33:24.419
and my mom just, like,
lets it happen.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.714
Just to keep him around.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.592
So I raise hell.
I mean, all the time.

33:32.301 --> 33:38.182
And now new dad
and new bro start tying me up,

33:39.517 --> 33:43.146
throwing me in a closet
when I acted out.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.024
Leave me there for hours.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.153
I even pissed myself sometimes.

33:52.363 --> 33:56.242
So they take turns beating me.

33:57.410 --> 34:01.205
And all I'd hear was, "Juanita,
there's a roof over your head.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.876
"Juanita, the bills are paid.
Juanita, it could be worse."

34:07.795 --> 34:12.258
But you know what?
Fuck that thinking.

34:15.636 --> 34:16.888
It could be better too.

34:19.182 --> 34:22.560
It should be. Right?

34:23.519 --> 34:28.858
This place is starting to look
a lot like my stepdad.

34:30.985 --> 34:37.241
And if I just sit by and watch,
that makes me my mom.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.579
And I am not my mom.

34:45.625 --> 34:49.170
So I gotta go.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.344
Okay.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.813
Because of what happened to me,

35:09.357 --> 35:12.860
when I see a man, I see a monster.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.323
I've been seeing them
like that long before

35:18.783 --> 35:22.411
they were dying
and coming back as actual monsters.

35:26.707 --> 35:27.917
But I know that's not you.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.379
I just want you to know that.

36:04.495 --> 36:08.499
We triple-checked everything.
Locked everything up.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.587
Probably just the wind.

36:18.467 --> 36:19.510
That wasn't wind.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.765
Yeah.
Maybe we should do another sweep.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.321
Shit.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.918
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.021
We gotta get to Eli and Jerry now!

37:19.320 --> 37:20.988
Wake up! Trouble!

37:35.670 --> 37:36.712
Go. Go now.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.048
Go. Get inside.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.762
There's gotta be
at least 50 of them.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.222
How'd they get in the walls?

37:54.605 --> 37:55.940
What the hell?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.444
Since when do the dead
use fricking doorknobs?

38:01.654 --> 38:02.863
Whisperers.

38:07.326 --> 38:10.830
Shit. You two, get on the roof, now.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.233
- How's the leg?
- Good enough.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.529
I'll hold the door. Be careful.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.133
Holy shit. Hey.
It's clear over here.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.972
We could make a jump for it. Maybe.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.894
- Yeah, no problem.
- No. We can't risk it.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.022
But if you two can make the jump,
flank the walkers on this side.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.358
I'll go back down.
We can work together,

39:20.358 --> 39:22.526
separate the Whisperers
from the rest of the group. Yeah?

39:22.777 --> 39:25.279
- All right.
- Okay. All right.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.048
Dude.

39:45.299 --> 39:48.469
Dude. Dude. Dude.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.359
Goddamn Whisperers.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.169
How the hell did a walker do that?

40:41.480 --> 40:44.900
So what do you think it was?
Like an aberration or something?

40:46.527 --> 40:49.572
There's roamers and lurkers.

40:51.031 --> 40:54.869
We've all seen some that come
back to the places they remember.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.832
I've heard stories about
walkers like this

40:59.832 --> 41:01.500
that can climb walls and open doors.

41:02.751 --> 41:04.336
I was never sure
if they were just stories.

41:06.046 --> 41:09.258
Maybe there's other kinds too.
I hope not.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.388
- You sure you're okay to travel?
- Thanks to you.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.391
- Come on, man. That was my fault.
- Today's a new day.

41:28.068 --> 41:29.320
I'm gonna grab
the rest of the stuff.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.823
Hey.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.179
So what was that
you were saying yesterday?

41:55.846 --> 41:58.933
Something about a Kingdom 2.0?

41:59.058 --> 42:01.435
You see it now, right?

42:03.103 --> 42:06.190
- Ezekiel could be king again.
- I don't know.

42:08.734 --> 42:12.863
Feels more like this place
was built for King Jerry.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.700
And Queen Nabila?

42:18.827 --> 42:22.790
King Jerry and Queen Nabila.
I like the sound of that.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.125
Me too.

42:35.886 --> 42:36.929
Max?

42:39.056 --> 42:40.266
She's not coming.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.352
- What? You found her?
- I did. But it was too late.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.521
She's already in police custody.
I'm sorry, Eugene.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.359
Shift's about to happen.
We should get going.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.702
Then it's time I bid you <i>adieu.</i>

43:04.039 --> 43:07.876
I'll check on the others.
Meet you back at your place.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.849
- My path leads elsewhere.
- There's no other path, Eugene.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.392
There is.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.729
I understand you're upset. I get it.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.440
But there's nothing
you can do for Max now.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.901
Maybe not. But what kind of man
would I be if I didn't try?

43:32.985 --> 43:35.946
One that's alive. If you stay here,
they will kill you.

43:36.071 --> 43:40.576
I know it's not logical,
but matters of the heart rarely are.

43:41.577 --> 43:42.828
I also know if I leave now,

43:42.828 --> 43:44.747
there won't be any kind of life
worth living.

43:45.998 --> 43:48.000
Being with Maxxine
has made me better,

43:49.084 --> 43:50.836
better than I ever thought
I could be.

43:53.380 --> 43:56.467
And as such,
I just don't see a path without her.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.304
I go where she is
or I just end up who I was.

44:00.554 --> 44:01.597
Eugene.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.809
When I was at my lowest,

44:07.603 --> 44:10.314
feeling like the posterior
of some cosmic joke,

44:10.564 --> 44:14.151
you told me that my person
was out there and that I'd find her.

44:15.444 --> 44:18.322
I know I didn't believe.
I trusted you, because I always do.

44:20.783 --> 44:21.825
You were right.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.371
Well, now I need you to trust me.

44:27.831 --> 44:30.376
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.
- It's not.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.837
You have to let me go.

44:38.008 --> 44:40.302
I'd like for you to give
something to Coco for me.

44:53.565 --> 44:56.402
I do believe that one day she'll
have the style to pull this off.

44:58.612 --> 45:00.322
Maybe, like, after age 15.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.146
On the ground, now.

45:35.858 --> 45:38.235
My name is Eugene Porter,
and I'm here to confess.

45:38.944 --> 45:41.405
I surreptitiously made a recording
of Sebastian Milton

45:41.405 --> 45:43.240
and played it
at the Founders' Day celebration.

45:44.241 --> 45:46.785
Furthermore, I confess to causing

45:46.869 --> 45:48.787
the unintentional death
of Mr. Milton

45:48.871 --> 45:50.247
in the melee that followed.

45:50.664 --> 45:51.707
Anything else?

45:54.376 --> 45:57.546
Yes. I acted alone.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.965
Maxxine Mercer may have been present

46:00.090 --> 46:01.717
but had nothing
to do with any of it.

46:07.514 --> 46:08.557
Take him.

47:13.205 --> 47:14.414
Is everyone ready?
