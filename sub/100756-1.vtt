WEBVTT

00:38.289 --> 00:39.188
Solomon.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.792
Solomon, I'm so sorry.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.432
I have to leave you
now, sweetheart.

00:49.366 --> 00:51.635
I cannot stay here.

00:55.138 --> 01:00.109
You will have to be strong on
your own like I know you can.

01:02.413 --> 01:05.114
All you need to do is
follow our three rules

01:05.148 --> 01:08.352
and they will keep you safe
as they always have done.

01:08.385 --> 01:11.120
You remember our rules,
don't you, Solomon?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.690
The first rule.

01:12.723 --> 01:14.824
We must always give
back to the forest

01:14.857 --> 01:16.125
that provides for us.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.662
So when you hunt or
scavenge, do it for two.

01:20.631 --> 01:23.567
One for the forest
and one for you.

01:25.736 --> 01:27.271
The second rule.

01:27.304 --> 01:31.508
When your will is almost gone
and you feel like giving up,

01:31.542 --> 01:33.510
find comfort in
singing our song.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.083
The third and final rule.

01:41.452 --> 01:44.655
This is the most
important rule of all.

01:44.688 --> 01:48.191
You must never ever let
go of the rope, Solomon.

01:48.224 --> 01:51.027
The rope is your guide,
this land is your home,

01:51.060 --> 01:53.664
and the rope will keep you
safe from harm within it.

01:54.832 --> 01:57.468
Always hold onto it
and you will have hope.

01:58.635 --> 02:01.204
Whatever you do,
don't lose the rope.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.107
I love you.

02:20.123 --> 02:21.725
Solomon.

04:41.932 --> 04:43.967
Don't lose the rope.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.004
I love you.

06:50.027 --> 06:52.262
And you feel like giving up,

06:52.295 --> 06:54.230
find comfort in
singing our song.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.601
The third and final rule.

06:58.702 --> 07:01.838
This is the most
important rule of all.

07:01.872 --> 07:05.342
You must never ever let
go of the rope, Solomon.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.177
The rope is your guide,
this land is your home,

07:08.210 --> 07:11.648
and the rope will keep you
safe from harm within in it.

07:11.682 --> 07:16.185
Always hold onto it
and you will have hope.

07:16.218 --> 07:19.289
Whatever you do,
don't lose the rope.

07:20.791 --> 07:22.259
I love you.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.287
Mother?

24:09.533 --> 24:11.601
Hello.

25:50.100 --> 25:50.934
Hello?

25:51.968 --> 25:52.803
Can you read me?

25:54.805 --> 25:56.006
This is Sailing Vessel Leilani.

25:56.039 --> 25:57.307
Do you copy?

28:11.141 --> 28:12.509
No.

28:12.542 --> 28:13.411
God.

28:20.351 --> 28:21.184
Hello?

28:22.052 --> 28:23.687
Is there anyone out there?

28:26.489 --> 28:27.891
Catherine.

28:36.499 --> 28:37.335
Fuck.

33:27.491 --> 33:28.758
All right, I've been
keeping this one for last

33:28.791 --> 33:29.926
because it's my favorite.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.495
Look at the hardwood floors.

33:31.528 --> 33:32.996
These beautiful ceilings.

33:33.029 --> 33:35.131
It's such a steal because
their daughter died

33:35.164 --> 33:36.132
in a car accident.

33:36.165 --> 33:37.635
It's so sad but the father

33:37.668 --> 33:39.869
and mother are just
really anxious.

39:24.514 --> 39:25.349
Bestia.

41:13.957 --> 41:14.791
Olivia.

41:22.365 --> 41:23.200
Olivia.

41:28.237 --> 41:29.139
I see your light on.

41:29.172 --> 41:30.440
I know you're not sleeping.

41:33.176 --> 41:34.444
Don't play possum.

41:39.483 --> 41:40.617
You look like a coal miner.

41:40.650 --> 41:41.485
Give me that.

41:42.686 --> 41:45.422
I told you to go
to bed an hour ago.

41:45.455 --> 41:47.224
But I'm not sleepy, Ellie.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.091
Mm hm.

41:50.961 --> 41:52.729
What's this?

41:55.298 --> 41:56.933
This again?

41:56.967 --> 41:59.002
It's stuck in my head.

42:01.972 --> 42:03.673
Starting to freak me out.

42:04.708 --> 42:05.709
What would mom and dad say?

42:05.742 --> 42:07.310
Don't tell them.

42:08.645 --> 42:12.716
I won't if you stop
drawing these creepy doodles.

42:12.749 --> 42:15.886
I can't draw anything else.

42:15.919 --> 42:17.255
I don't know why.

42:27.497 --> 42:30.600
Look, we talked about this.

42:30.634 --> 42:32.402
You wandered off into the woods

42:32.435 --> 42:33.970
and spent a scary night outside,

42:34.004 --> 42:37.474
but we found you the
next morning, didn't we?

42:39.342 --> 42:41.845
I can't remember
what happened.

42:41.878 --> 42:43.513
That's for the best.

42:43.547 --> 42:45.582
I mean, it was weeks ago.

42:45.615 --> 42:46.650
You gotta let it go.

42:48.385 --> 42:52.322
You told me to wait
and you didn't come back.

42:52.355 --> 42:53.990
No, that's not what happened.

42:54.024 --> 42:57.794
I was held back and
you wandered off.

42:57.828 --> 42:59.029
That's the truth.

42:59.896 --> 43:01.031
But...

43:01.064 --> 43:02.332
Do you wanna
make mom sad again?

43:03.700 --> 43:04.901
No.

43:04.935 --> 43:06.236
She cried her
eyes out, you know.

43:07.704 --> 43:08.638
But think about it.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.006
You were in no real danger.

43:11.241 --> 43:13.510
It's not like there's
wolves in those woods.

43:13.543 --> 43:14.312
No.

43:17.547 --> 43:19.449
Something else.

43:19.482 --> 43:20.917
What are you talking about?

43:22.853 --> 43:26.556
I think I wasn't alone.

43:26.590 --> 43:28.058
It was just
your imagination.

43:28.091 --> 43:29.526
No, it was real.

43:29.559 --> 43:31.329
Enough!

43:38.068 --> 43:40.670
I think it followed me.

43:45.442 --> 43:46.610
Oh, come on.

44:20.610 --> 44:22.545
It's just your stupid toy.

44:32.789 --> 44:35.259
Now, I don't wanna hear
about it ever again.

44:35.293 --> 44:37.193
If you don't promise me right
now, I'm gonna show this.

44:37.227 --> 44:39.397
No, don't.

44:39.429 --> 44:40.497
Are we in agreement?

44:40.530 --> 44:41.365
Are we good?

44:42.499 --> 44:43.401
Okay.

44:46.337 --> 44:47.271
Bed now.

44:48.672 --> 44:50.907
You know you're not
allowed to have boys over.

44:50.941 --> 44:53.344
It's not a boy and it's
none of your business.

44:55.011 --> 44:56.347
Ellie, don't go.

44:57.580 --> 44:58.848
Listen, you're a big girl

44:58.882 --> 45:00.951
and you know there's
nothing to be scared of.

45:00.984 --> 45:03.219
So just go to sleep.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.427
Say anything to anyone
and you're dead.

45:09.459 --> 45:10.294
Understood?

45:12.462 --> 45:13.863
All right, goodnight.

47:18.188 --> 47:19.423
Olivia.

47:45.982 --> 47:47.217
Are you okay?

47:48.419 --> 47:49.587
That sound.

47:49.619 --> 47:52.122
I think it came
from Olivia's room.

47:53.324 --> 47:55.058
Little sister
giving you trouble?

47:57.060 --> 47:59.263
She hasn't been the
same since that night.

48:03.434 --> 48:04.634
Those drawings.

48:04.667 --> 48:08.771
And I can't remember the
last time she laughed.

48:09.672 --> 48:11.408
Give her a break.

48:11.442 --> 48:12.909
You too, really?

48:12.942 --> 48:15.346
Come on, you know what I mean.

48:15.379 --> 48:19.048
And besides, we're at least
partially to blame for.

48:19.082 --> 48:21.418
She was found and she's fine.

48:25.755 --> 48:27.190
You should go check on her.

48:29.225 --> 48:30.059
All right.

48:31.194 --> 48:32.363
Wait for me.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.674
Olivia.

48:46.377 --> 48:49.746
Olivia, quit fooling around.

48:49.779 --> 48:50.614
Do you hear me?

48:51.981 --> 48:53.249
Olivia.

49:01.958 --> 49:03.360
Olivia?

49:23.280 --> 49:25.114
Olivia, what the hell?

49:29.786 --> 49:31.120
Stop playing hide and seek.

50:11.127 --> 50:13.364
All right Olivia, this
isn't funny anymore.

50:14.698 --> 50:16.232
If you don't come out of
that closet in three seconds.

50:16.267 --> 50:17.800
I swear to god, Olivia.

50:19.869 --> 50:21.037
Ellie.

50:26.610 --> 50:27.444
Olivia.

51:05.848 --> 51:06.650
Olivia.

51:12.389 --> 51:14.692
I remember everything now.

51:40.216 --> 51:42.720
We'll be together forever.

52:02.272 --> 52:03.072
They followed you here?

52:03.106 --> 52:04.040
Yes.

52:04.073 --> 52:05.376
Who followed you?

52:05.409 --> 52:07.210
The evil one.

52:07.243 --> 52:08.911
He looked like any other man.

52:08.945 --> 52:11.348
He was dressed
like any other man.

52:11.382 --> 52:13.216
He almost walked to find me,

52:13.249 --> 52:17.588
but I left a mess for his
mistakes and I killed him.

52:17.621 --> 52:19.723
Scratched him from
his head down.

52:22.793 --> 52:24.994
That will be done.

52:25.027 --> 52:26.929
You killed him, the
man with the pike?

52:28.030 --> 52:29.966
The man who followed you?

52:31.502 --> 52:33.637
No one else followed you.

52:57.828 --> 52:59.228
God, that took forever.

53:00.764 --> 53:02.366
Yeah, when did Whole
Foods become the place to be

53:02.399 --> 53:04.167
on a Saturday night.

53:04.200 --> 53:07.170
Think people would be at bars
not buying a spread of quinoa.

53:08.037 --> 53:09.406
You ready to get depressed?

53:12.241 --> 53:13.544
We're two of those people?

53:13.577 --> 53:15.111
Quinoa and all.

53:15.144 --> 53:18.582
Well, we have a
legitimate excuse.

53:18.615 --> 53:20.517
What's the rest of the world's?

53:20.551 --> 53:23.186
Sacrifices you make
when family is visiting.

53:27.089 --> 53:30.561
Speaking of sacrifices,
your sister I presume.

53:31.428 --> 53:33.196
Like you got room to talk.

53:33.229 --> 53:35.031
Look, it's a rough time.

53:35.064 --> 53:37.967
I think we can afford to cut
Cody a little sanitary slack.

53:40.938 --> 53:42.339
Just a week though, right?

53:43.674 --> 53:44.508
Sure.

53:53.884 --> 53:55.619
Just gonna drop these
towels off in the room.

53:55.652 --> 53:57.220
I'll be right back.

54:00.691 --> 54:02.426
Hey, I didn't realize you were.

54:05.027 --> 54:07.364
Did you leave the
guest room light on?

54:07.397 --> 54:08.732
Negative.

54:08.765 --> 54:09.933
Maybe she's home.

54:13.937 --> 54:14.738
Cody?

54:17.039 --> 54:18.074
What is it?

54:18.107 --> 54:19.008
Nothing.

54:19.041 --> 54:19.776
I'll be down in a minute.

54:54.243 --> 54:56.613
Still no sign of her, huh?

54:56.647 --> 54:58.080
Guess she's still one
of the few clinging on

54:58.114 --> 54:59.616
to a social life.

54:59.650 --> 55:01.083
Well I put some
of her clothes away.

55:01.117 --> 55:02.953
May make her feel more at home.

55:02.986 --> 55:05.355
Just don't make her feel
too at home, all right.

55:05.389 --> 55:06.188
Don't get me wrong.

55:06.222 --> 55:07.691
I love your sister.

55:07.724 --> 55:09.793
I'm just not in the market
for any long term roommates.

55:12.061 --> 55:13.463
Except the one I married.

55:14.264 --> 55:15.097
Babe.

55:25.809 --> 55:28.645
Should we be good hosts
and wait up for her?

55:28.679 --> 55:30.047
Trust me.

55:30.079 --> 55:30.847
She'll think we'll
better hosts if we don't.

55:30.881 --> 55:31.682
Besides I'm beat.

55:31.715 --> 55:32.749
Let's just go to bed.

55:32.783 --> 55:34.351
Oh come on, it's 9:30.

55:34.384 --> 55:36.019
That's gotta be some
sort of fucking record.

55:36.053 --> 55:37.621
Well, we have the
bedtime of parents

55:37.654 --> 55:39.489
without the annoyance of kids.

55:39.523 --> 55:41.090
Don't forget
about your sister.

55:41.123 --> 55:41.959
Ow.

55:43.192 --> 55:44.193
Really hurt.

55:46.228 --> 55:47.965
You think she'll find a job?

55:47.998 --> 55:48.799
Depends.

55:48.832 --> 55:49.700
Your office is hiring?

55:50.767 --> 55:52.002
That'll be an
interesting experience.

55:52.035 --> 55:54.203
Probably the
best of your life.

55:54.236 --> 55:57.975
Please, I prefer to think
happy thoughts before I sleep.

56:05.916 --> 56:07.017
I'll call in some
favors on Monday.

56:07.050 --> 56:08.018
See what we can do.

56:09.419 --> 56:10.454
Hey, thank you.

56:11.722 --> 56:13.490
Seriously, I really
appreciate it.

56:15.759 --> 56:18.194
Just know that
if I had siblings,

56:18.227 --> 56:20.931
they'd be really fucked up and
you'd have to deal with them.

56:20.964 --> 56:23.367
Okay 24 seven.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.534
Well thank God.

56:24.568 --> 56:26.536
I think you are
plenty of work for me.

56:26.570 --> 56:27.371
Goodnight.

56:27.404 --> 56:28.405
Goodnight.

1:01:49.726 --> 1:01:52.696
Hi, I'm Sophia.

1:01:52.729 --> 1:01:53.596
Who are you?

1:01:55.131 --> 1:01:56.766
I'm Steve.

1:01:57.867 --> 1:01:59.403
Hi, Steve.

1:01:59.437 --> 1:02:00.837
Is this your first time?

1:02:02.906 --> 1:02:05.709
Well it's your first time
calling me, isn't it?

1:02:05.742 --> 1:02:06.543
Yeah.

1:02:08.312 --> 1:02:10.414
You
sound really sexy.

1:02:10.448 --> 1:02:12.215
Where are you right now?

1:02:12.248 --> 1:02:13.384
I'm in the office.

1:02:13.417 --> 1:02:15.018
Everyone's gone home now.

1:02:15.051 --> 1:02:15.885
Where are you?

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:18.788
I'm in bed.

1:02:18.822 --> 1:02:20.790
I was gonna start
touching myself.

1:02:20.824 --> 1:02:21.958
Do you think I should?

1:02:23.159 --> 1:02:24.428
If you want.

1:02:26.496 --> 1:02:28.565
My
breast feel so soft.

1:02:28.598 --> 1:02:31.601
I'm thinking about
your long, hard cock.

1:02:31.634 --> 1:02:32.535
I'm fucking you.

1:02:32.569 --> 1:02:33.304
I'm fucking you right now.

1:02:33.337 --> 1:02:34.305
Good.

1:02:34.338 --> 1:02:35.538
Fuck me.

1:02:35.572 --> 1:02:37.974
Fuck me so hard I can't
sit again for a week.

1:02:38.008 --> 1:02:38.908
I'm fucking you.

1:02:38.942 --> 1:02:40.043
Yes, keep going.

1:02:40.076 --> 1:02:41.111
Keep fucking me.

1:02:41.144 --> 1:02:41.911
Oh, that's good.

1:02:41.945 --> 1:02:43.179
You're in so deep.

1:02:43.213 --> 1:02:44.014
I'm in a pitch.

1:02:44.047 --> 1:02:44.981
Keep going.

1:02:45.015 --> 1:02:46.182
Keep fucking me.

1:02:46.216 --> 1:02:47.017
Oh, I'm gonna come.

1:02:53.757 --> 1:02:56.226
I can only go once.

1:02:56.260 --> 1:02:57.093
Are you ready?

1:03:18.282 --> 1:03:19.383
She did not.

1:03:20.583 --> 1:03:22.520
Yes, she did.

1:03:23.686 --> 1:03:26.524
Christ, that is
so humiliating.

1:03:26.556 --> 1:03:27.724
I know right.

1:03:27.757 --> 1:03:28.758
What did she say?

1:03:34.365 --> 1:03:35.565
I mean, Christ.

1:03:35.598 --> 1:03:37.468
I'd be beating myself
if that happened to me.

1:03:39.569 --> 1:03:41.137
Japanese suicide.

1:03:41.171 --> 1:03:42.406
Listen B, I've gotta get this.

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:43.640
I'll call you back
in a minute, yeah.

1:03:44.941 --> 1:03:46.009
All right, all right, bye.

1:03:51.781 --> 1:03:55.151
Hey baby, I'm Rita.

1:03:55.185 --> 1:03:56.653
What are you wearing?

1:03:58.154 --> 1:03:59.589
Nothing.

1:03:59.622 --> 1:04:02.092
Nothing but my tight pants.

1:04:02.125 --> 1:04:03.226
Take them off.

1:04:05.228 --> 1:04:08.064
Okay, I'm taking them off.

1:04:08.098 --> 1:04:09.433
Call me Sir.

1:04:09.467 --> 1:04:10.733
No Daddy.

1:04:10.767 --> 1:04:11.734
Call me Sir.

1:04:13.937 --> 1:04:15.439
Sir.

1:04:15.473 --> 1:04:17.073
I'm taking them off, Sir.

1:04:17.107 --> 1:04:19.175
Are you lying to me?

1:04:19.209 --> 1:04:20.043
No, Sir.

1:04:22.045 --> 1:04:24.214
What are you doing now?

1:04:24.247 --> 1:04:25.748
I'm naked now.

1:04:25.782 --> 1:04:29.520
I'm lying out on my
bed as I touch myself.

1:04:29.553 --> 1:04:31.087
You didn't call me Sir.

1:04:32.356 --> 1:04:33.290
Sorry, Sir.

1:04:34.691 --> 1:04:35.758
Good.

1:04:36.594 --> 1:04:38.496
Bark like a dog for me.

1:04:40.930 --> 1:04:42.299
Woof.

1:04:42.333 --> 1:04:43.434
No.

1:04:43.467 --> 1:04:44.901
Like a real dog.

1:04:46.636 --> 1:04:47.438
Woof.

1:04:48.705 --> 1:04:49.540
Howl.

1:04:52.343 --> 1:04:53.176
Ow.

1:04:58.315 --> 1:05:00.417
I don't believe you.

1:05:00.451 --> 1:05:01.619
Your barking.

1:05:01.651 --> 1:05:02.819
That you're touching yourself.

1:05:02.852 --> 1:05:03.653
None of it.

1:05:05.088 --> 1:05:06.923
I really don't think
you care, do you?

1:05:06.956 --> 1:05:09.092
Of course I care, baby.

1:05:09.125 --> 1:05:11.462
You're just gonna
have to believe me.

1:05:11.495 --> 1:05:14.230
Call me Sir, not baby.

1:05:14.265 --> 1:05:17.368
Send me a picture of yourself
right now and I will.

1:05:17.401 --> 1:05:18.536
No.

1:05:18.569 --> 1:05:19.470
Why not?

1:05:19.503 --> 1:05:20.970
Because I don't want to.

1:05:21.004 --> 1:05:22.306
I'm spending the money.

1:05:22.339 --> 1:05:24.841
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

1:05:24.874 --> 1:05:26.943
Because I am who I say I am.

1:05:26.976 --> 1:05:28.912
So Rita
is your real name?

1:05:28.945 --> 1:05:30.146
Yes.

1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:32.148
Well, you were
much more convincing

1:05:32.182 --> 1:05:33.317
when you were Sophia.

1:05:34.485 --> 1:05:36.620
Fuck you, man, I'm
gonna call the police.

1:05:41.625 --> 1:05:42.459
Fuck.

1:05:51.801 --> 1:05:54.137
Hi, I'm Sophia.

1:05:54.170 --> 1:05:55.205
Who are you?

1:05:55.238 --> 1:05:56.806
Hi Steve.

1:05:56.839 --> 1:05:58.241
Is this your first time?

1:05:59.410 --> 1:06:01.177
I was gonna start
touching myself.

1:06:01.211 --> 1:06:02.379
Do you think I should?

1:06:02.413 --> 1:06:03.581
Yeah, you like that.

1:06:03.614 --> 1:06:05.316
Fuck me so hard I can't
sit down for a week.

1:06:05.349 --> 1:06:08.051
I'll do anything you want.

1:06:18.995 --> 1:06:20.964
I know who
you really are.

1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:23.534
Stephanie.

1:06:25.001 --> 1:06:27.203
I know your parents
are away from home.

1:06:28.439 --> 1:06:29.872
But what do you
think they would say

1:06:29.906 --> 1:06:31.542
if they knew what
you were doing?

1:06:32.643 --> 1:06:33.843
What about your friends?

1:06:34.911 --> 1:06:36.447
Once they've heard these tapes,

1:06:37.847 --> 1:06:40.351
do you think they'd ever look
at you the same way again?

1:06:41.751 --> 1:06:44.355
If you don't do what I
say, they will hear them.

1:06:45.522 --> 1:06:47.824
It doesn't matter
who you say you are.

1:06:47.857 --> 1:06:48.626
Rita.

1:06:48.659 --> 1:06:49.493
Sophia.

1:06:49.526 --> 1:06:50.527
Stephanie.

1:06:52.161 --> 1:06:55.466
Everyone will know you really
are once I'm done with you.

1:06:55.499 --> 1:06:57.534
You'd be an attraction.

1:06:57.568 --> 1:06:59.202
A freak.

1:06:59.235 --> 1:07:01.204
An anecdote at a party.

1:07:01.237 --> 1:07:03.973
That girl I know
who does phone sex.

1:07:05.208 --> 1:07:06.510
You should hear her, mate.

1:07:08.144 --> 1:07:11.382
So they go to the computer
and bring up your website.

1:07:11.415 --> 1:07:14.884
Yes, there will be a
website just for you.

1:07:17.086 --> 1:07:18.489
Who are they really hurting?

1:07:19.757 --> 1:07:21.891
Some girl whose picture
is on the screen.

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:26.530
Do you think your friends
will find it funny or sad?

1:07:26.563 --> 1:07:27.531
Probably funny.

1:07:29.098 --> 1:07:31.268
Are you fucking there?

1:07:41.844 --> 1:07:42.746
Getting colder.

1:07:51.854 --> 1:07:52.690
Little warmer.

1:07:55.024 --> 1:07:55.858
Warmer.

1:07:58.227 --> 1:07:59.062
Warmer.

1:08:01.230 --> 1:08:02.700
Getting hot now.

1:08:07.036 --> 1:08:07.837
Boo.

1:08:18.515 --> 1:08:20.183
There's a man in my house.

1:08:20.216 --> 1:08:21.552
He's on the phone.

1:08:22.686 --> 1:08:26.623
Don't ever
do that again.

1:08:26.657 --> 1:08:29.560
You listen closely because
I won't repeat myself.

1:08:30.728 --> 1:08:33.530
If you hang up on me,
I will destroy you.

1:08:33.564 --> 1:08:36.966
If you lie to me again,
I will destroy you.

1:08:38.402 --> 1:08:41.472
If you disobey me again,
I will destroy you.

1:08:43.172 --> 1:08:46.610
If you call the police
again, I will destroy you.

1:08:48.812 --> 1:08:51.247
Just so you are totally
clear on what will happen

1:08:51.281 --> 1:08:53.450
if you do any of these things.

1:08:53.484 --> 1:08:56.152
First I will share
them with your parents.

1:08:56.185 --> 1:08:57.987
Your friends will be next.

1:08:58.020 --> 1:08:59.922
Then I will spread
them like a virus

1:08:59.956 --> 1:09:02.793
until you hear the sound
of your voice so often

1:09:02.826 --> 1:09:04.927
you will wish you
were born mute.

1:09:06.363 --> 1:09:08.332
Do you understand me?

1:09:12.001 --> 1:09:15.004
You have to the count of three.

1:09:17.374 --> 1:09:18.207
One.

1:09:19.075 --> 1:09:20.243
Two.

1:09:20.277 --> 1:09:21.512
I understand.

1:09:24.213 --> 1:09:26.884
You didn't call me, Sir.

1:09:28.452 --> 1:09:29.620
I understand, Sir.

1:09:41.532 --> 1:09:42.699
Right.

1:09:45.369 --> 1:09:46.202
Forwards.

1:09:51.974 --> 1:09:52.810
Right.

1:09:54.478 --> 1:09:56.112
Go to the door.

1:10:06.088 --> 1:10:06.924
Good.

1:10:07.925 --> 1:10:09.460
Now we're going to start again.

1:10:11.695 --> 1:10:12.529
What?

1:10:13.664 --> 1:10:15.632
We're going
to do this again

1:10:15.666 --> 1:10:17.267
and you aren't going to pretend.

1:10:18.435 --> 1:10:20.737
You're going to be you
and it will be real.

1:10:21.839 --> 1:10:23.172
Do you understand?

1:10:25.776 --> 1:10:26.710
Yes, Sir.

1:10:28.345 --> 1:10:29.446
Are you ready?

1:10:30.848 --> 1:10:31.782
Yes, Sir.

1:10:32.883 --> 1:10:34.852
If I don't
believe you, I hang up.

1:10:36.553 --> 1:10:38.120
Let's begin.

1:10:41.692 --> 1:10:42.526
Hi.

1:10:43.961 --> 1:10:44.795
I'm Stephanie.

1:10:45.762 --> 1:10:47.898
What's your name?

1:10:49.566 --> 1:10:51.368
I don't believe you.

1:10:51.401 --> 1:10:56.373
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1:10:57.139 --> 1:10:58.509
Start again.

1:11:00.711 --> 1:11:01.512
Hi.

1:11:02.713 --> 1:11:04.548
I'm Stephanie.

1:11:04.581 --> 1:11:05.549
Who are you?

1:11:07.216 --> 1:11:08.886
Jeremy.

1:11:08.919 --> 1:11:10.787
What are you doing?

1:11:16.125 --> 1:11:18.795
This is your last chance.

1:11:18.829 --> 1:11:20.397
Are you ready?

1:11:25.602 --> 1:11:27.036
Who are you?

1:11:27.069 --> 1:11:28.605
Jeremy.

1:11:28.639 --> 1:11:29.473
And you?

1:11:31.140 --> 1:11:33.410
Stephanie, Sir.

1:11:34.945 --> 1:11:36.580
That's
a beautiful name.

1:11:36.613 --> 1:11:39.716
Tell me Stephanie,
how do you feel?

1:11:41.217 --> 1:11:42.319
I'm scared, Sir.

1:11:43.820 --> 1:11:45.689
Good.

1:11:45.722 --> 1:11:48.057
So you don't lie like
all the other girls.

1:11:50.192 --> 1:11:51.662
I won't lie to you, Sir.

1:11:54.163 --> 1:11:55.432
Where are you?

1:11:56.300 --> 1:11:57.467
I'm by my window.

1:11:58.402 --> 1:11:59.870
Tell me truthfully.

1:12:00.837 --> 1:12:02.739
How did you lose your virginity?

1:12:06.142 --> 1:12:07.611
It was at a house party.

1:12:08.979 --> 1:12:10.480
I liked this boy for ages.

1:12:10.514 --> 1:12:12.783
He went to the same school.

1:12:14.418 --> 1:12:18.255
We went to the toilets and yeah.

1:12:19.656 --> 1:12:21.058
How old were you?

1:12:22.091 --> 1:12:23.026
17.

1:12:24.093 --> 1:12:25.529
Was it your party?

1:12:27.096 --> 1:12:28.765
No, a friend's.

1:12:30.199 --> 1:12:31.568
How did it feel?

1:12:34.671 --> 1:12:36.172
Not that bad, not that good.

1:12:38.174 --> 1:12:39.343
It was over very quickly.

1:12:39.376 --> 1:12:41.011
It was a bit anti climatic.

1:12:42.512 --> 1:12:44.180
What
happened to the boy?

1:12:46.248 --> 1:12:47.384
We didn't talk again.

1:12:49.353 --> 1:12:50.687
Why'd you do this?

1:12:52.623 --> 1:12:53.457
Do what?

1:12:54.658 --> 1:12:55.692
Phone sex.

1:12:57.060 --> 1:12:58.194
I don't know.

1:12:58.227 --> 1:13:00.430
The money and I thought
I'd be good at it.

1:13:02.065 --> 1:13:02.899
Why?

1:13:04.501 --> 1:13:05.302
I don't know.

1:13:05.335 --> 1:13:06.603
I just did.

1:13:06.637 --> 1:13:08.905
You take that
tone, you get punished.

1:13:08.939 --> 1:13:10.507
Open the door.

1:13:32.095 --> 1:13:35.565
Take your top off.

1:13:35.599 --> 1:13:36.433
What?

1:13:37.968 --> 1:13:40.303
You disobeyed me.

1:13:44.675 --> 1:13:45.509
Fine.

1:13:46.877 --> 1:13:49.146
This is what you want.

1:13:49.178 --> 1:13:52.049
This is what you fucking want.

1:13:52.082 --> 1:13:52.916
Huh?

1:13:54.084 --> 1:13:56.119
If we're gonna do this,
then fine let's do this,

1:13:56.153 --> 1:13:59.322
but I'm not gonna pretend
I'm enjoying this.

1:14:04.027 --> 1:14:08.932
You're gonna keep this
going, we do it this way.

1:14:15.105 --> 1:14:19.176
Do you touch yourself
when you're on the phone?

1:14:21.278 --> 1:14:22.079
Yes.

1:14:24.213 --> 1:14:26.817
Do you want me to
touch myself here now?

1:14:26.850 --> 1:14:27.684
Yes.

1:14:32.656 --> 1:14:33.957
I'm a good girl, Sir.

1:14:35.692 --> 1:14:36.893
I won't lie to you.

1:14:39.429 --> 1:14:42.299
If I give you these,
will you leave me alone?

1:14:42.332 --> 1:14:43.967
Yes.

1:15:04.187 --> 1:15:08.759
What do you want
me to do with them now, Sir?

1:15:08.792 --> 1:15:10.160
Throw them to me.

1:15:10.193 --> 1:15:11.027
Are you ready?

1:15:12.329 --> 1:15:13.697
Yeah.

1:15:14.798 --> 1:15:15.632
Three.

1:15:17.868 --> 1:15:19.302
Two.

1:15:22.038 --> 1:15:22.873
One.

1:15:29.279 --> 1:15:30.447
Shit.

1:15:48.465 --> 1:15:50.700
Please, please Steph, stop.

1:15:52.002 --> 1:15:54.004
Don't call the police.

1:15:54.037 --> 1:15:56.740
Tell me what I need to do
to make it right, please.

1:15:56.773 --> 1:15:58.909
I'll delete all the audio files.

1:15:58.942 --> 1:16:01.645
I'll delete everything.

1:16:01.678 --> 1:16:02.445
Do you want money?

1:16:02.479 --> 1:16:04.648
I can give you money.

1:16:04.681 --> 1:16:06.383
Please answer me.

1:16:06.416 --> 1:16:07.884
Answer me.

1:16:07.918 --> 1:16:10.687
If you call the
police, I'm fucked.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:12.322
I've got children.

1:16:12.355 --> 1:16:13.824
You'll ruin their life.

1:16:15.659 --> 1:16:17.727
Stephanie please.

1:16:17.761 --> 1:16:19.329
Please, I'm sorry.

1:16:21.531 --> 1:16:22.699
A stupid joke.

1:16:24.268 --> 1:16:25.101
Please.

1:16:27.070 --> 1:16:28.839
Stephanie, I'm sorry.

1:16:38.648 --> 1:16:41.051
Take off your clothes now.

1:16:48.992 --> 1:16:52.028
And don't forget to call me Sir.
