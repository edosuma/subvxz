WEBVTT

00:15.036 --> 00:17.286
Look, my parents probably won't even ask,

00:17.286 --> 00:20.199
but if they do, I spent the
night at your house, ok?

00:21.845 --> 00:23.098
Damn,

00:23.853 --> 00:26.397
got two dangles on my ass.

00:26.397 --> 00:27.804
I'll call you back.

00:29.581 --> 00:32.128
I'm not even going that fast.

00:52.715 --> 00:56.095
Officer I think I'm lost.

01:13.259 --> 01:14.094
You made good time.

01:14.094 --> 01:16.055
Yeah yeah, I

01:17.001 --> 01:20.842
I rolled out as soon as
I got the call. Oh, no.

01:20.842 --> 01:23.076
What? Did you know him?

01:25.621 --> 01:27.706
Yeah, his name is Dan Cofield,

01:27.706 --> 01:30.622
I worked on a case with
him a few years ago.

01:30.962 --> 01:33.032
He's got a wife and kids.

01:39.579 --> 01:41.719
Hi / Yeah.

01:41.719 --> 01:44.507
Girl says officer Cofield pulled her over,

01:44.507 --> 01:46.624
walked up already covered in blood.

01:46.624 --> 01:47.687
Collapsed right in front of her.

01:47.687 --> 01:48.770
Is that her right there?

01:48.770 --> 01:51.512
Yeah, the name's Maloire Jacobs.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.905
She didn't do it though.

01:53.244 --> 01:56.030
I checked in and around her car,
and no gun, no casings.

01:56.030 --> 01:57.742
Swabbed her hand for GSR.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.199
Unless she's the greatest
actress in the world,

01:59.199 --> 02:00.939
the kid's telling the truth.

02:00.939 --> 02:03.283
Ok, let's call in all shifts.

02:03.545 --> 02:05.158
They hit one of us,

02:06.262 --> 02:07.624
they hit us all.

02:43.103 --> 02:46.005
MIAMI
2x20 The Oath

02:58.835 --> 03:00.396
He took two in the vest Alexx?

03:00.396 --> 03:01.669
Uh hmm,

03:01.669 --> 03:03.931
class two vest did it's job.

03:03.931 --> 03:06.175
Stopped these bullets from penetrating.

03:06.615 --> 03:07.976
So what killed him?

03:07.976 --> 03:12.065
Well, vests can't stop it if it doesn't cover.

03:13.698 --> 03:15.745
Bullet entered his upper torso,

03:16.131 --> 03:17.911
penetrated his lung.

03:19.482 --> 03:22.435
Bloody foam around the mouth
indicates pulmonary edema.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.309
Lung's filled with fluid.

03:24.309 --> 03:25.892
Poor boy couldn't breathe.

03:25.892 --> 03:27.240
So that explains why he couldn't use the

03:27.240 --> 03:29.899
radio to call for help, right? / Yeah

03:39.157 --> 03:41.061
I'll know more when I finish my post.

03:41.061 --> 03:43.190
Ok. Thank you.

03:45.613 --> 03:47.927
Three bullets struck in the
passenger-side door.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.302
They're all 38 caliber.

03:49.302 --> 03:51.062
Cofield get a shot though?

03:51.062 --> 03:52.224
His magazine's missing five rounds but

03:52.224 --> 03:54.329
I haven't seen any casings.

03:54.329 --> 03:56.024
My guess is he was shot somewhere else.

03:56.024 --> 03:59.020
That coroborates our witness'
story about the stop.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.126
So I guess this isn't our
primary crime scene.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.571
Right now, it's the only thing we've got.

04:10.603 --> 04:12.321
I've got blood in here.

04:12.825 --> 04:15.732
Something definitely went
on in the back of this car.

04:16.428 --> 04:19.765
I wanna see what happened at the
front with this on-board camera.

04:28.343 --> 04:29.884
This tape plays on a loop.

04:29.884 --> 04:31.614
It's activated when you hit the light bar,

04:31.614 --> 04:34.737
so we might be able to get something off of it.

04:35.059 --> 04:36.839
Our victim, officer Dan Cofield had

04:36.839 --> 04:40.340
four traffic stops last night,
not counting the girl.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.603
You wanna start with the most
recent and work backward?

04:42.603 --> 04:43.602
Sure.

04:45.939 --> 04:47.549
I wonder why he called this guy over.

04:47.549 --> 04:49.611
Will you check the MDT log?

04:55.188 --> 04:58.390
Now there's no Mobile Data Terminal entry

04:58.390 --> 05:00.763
corresponding with this time stamp.

05:00.763 --> 05:03.011
He never logged the stop?
That's strange.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.591
It's worse than strange.

05:04.591 --> 05:07.075
It's the type of thing to get your days off.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.687
Why are they walking to
the back of the radio car?

05:15.020 --> 05:16.388
What was that?

05:16.388 --> 05:19.223
Something's happening behind the camera.

05:20.244 --> 05:22.352
May be a little baton therapy?

05:22.352 --> 05:25.232
Could explain the blood and
hair we found on the cage.

05:27.502 --> 05:29.491
The plates are current.
Will you run them?

05:38.413 --> 05:41.818
Fred Rutter. Address in Hialeah.

05:42.265 --> 05:44.307
He's the same guy from the video.

05:45.474 --> 05:46.548
I wasn't there.

05:46.963 --> 05:49.879
Well we have DNA proof.
Blood and hair.

05:50.415 --> 05:52.228
Do you wanna tell us
why he pulled you over?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.555
It's personal. Mr. Rutter,

05:55.555 --> 05:57.198
the murder of a police officer

05:57.198 --> 05:59.287
is more personal than you can imagine.

05:59.287 --> 06:02.393
Murder? Oh, woa, hey,

06:02.393 --> 06:03.869
I didn't kill any cop.

06:03.869 --> 06:05.153
I didn't even touch him.

06:05.153 --> 06:07.560
You are our number one suspect.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.518
I suggest that you start talking right now.

06:12.642 --> 06:15.686
Look, Cofield lives across
the street from me.

06:15.686 --> 06:17.161
He's always hasseling me about my dogs

06:17.161 --> 06:19.868
barking and fixing the bikes on the lawn.

06:19.868 --> 06:21.191
So I told him off.

06:21.191 --> 06:22.969
And look at this!
He went Rodney King on me!

06:22.969 --> 06:25.363
Why didn't you file a complaint
with the police department?

06:25.363 --> 06:26.978
Are you kidding me?

06:27.573 --> 06:29.338
I know how you guys work.

06:29.338 --> 06:31.301
Blew all the silence,

06:31.301 --> 06:33.079
backing each other's play, come on!

06:33.079 --> 06:34.592
Actually it doesn't work like that.

06:34.592 --> 06:36.021
Yeah, right.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.275
Can anybody vouch for your
whereabouts last night?

06:38.275 --> 06:40.313
I dunno, about 300 people
at the shore club.

06:40.313 --> 06:41.805
I work closing.

06:41.805 --> 06:43.508
One more thing.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.384
That blood on your watch.
I'm curious about it.

06:46.384 --> 06:47.990
Where did it come from.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.894
Well, it's probably mine after
what that maniac did to me.

06:51.894 --> 06:54.573
Calleigh, check his watch,

06:54.573 --> 06:56.679
and then check his story.

07:44.025 --> 07:45.997
Mike, escort me would ya?

08:38.828 --> 08:40.890
Eric! / H!

08:42.294 --> 08:45.753
Listen, I followed markings from
the muffler to this location.

08:46.115 --> 08:49.653
Found blood, casings, and
uh, some tread marks.

08:49.653 --> 08:51.200
Found our shooting scene. Excellent.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.731
There's only one problem.

08:52.731 --> 08:53.860
The IAB.

08:54.863 --> 08:57.196
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

08:57.196 --> 08:58.199
Rick!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.039
You're in my crime scene.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.138
Actually, you're in mine Horatio.

09:04.138 --> 09:07.553
I take it that Internal Affairs
guys have developed

09:07.553 --> 09:09.503
a fascination with forensics.

09:09.503 --> 09:11.500
Ah, that's good. I'll remember that.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.932
What are you doing here?

09:12.932 --> 09:14.088
Saw the report this AM,

09:14.088 --> 09:16.981
Danny Cofield was working outside
his assigned patrol area.

09:16.981 --> 09:18.743
So, you're ahead of the curve.
That's sexy.

09:18.743 --> 09:20.391
We've both got a job to do.

09:20.391 --> 09:22.812
I expect to be copied on every
part of this investigation.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.083
I will be kept in the loop?

09:24.083 --> 09:25.729
A police officer has been killed,

09:25.729 --> 09:27.947
and I need to take a look at that, now!

09:31.324 --> 09:33.366
Hi / Hey.

09:33.366 --> 09:34.722
Pick you up at eight?

09:35.386 --> 09:36.835
Got reservations at "Touch".

09:36.835 --> 09:39.377
- That sounds good.
- Alright, bye bye.

09:45.589 --> 09:48.722
So..., wow!

09:49.059 --> 09:51.026
Yeah, me and Stetler.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.685
When did that happen?

09:53.685 --> 09:55.733
He asked me out, I said yes.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.891
That's usually how it works.

10:02.572 --> 10:04.719
Stetler is simple,

10:04.719 --> 10:07.451
and this is just,

10:07.451 --> 10:09.063
comlicated. / Yeah.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.184
Complicated.

10:15.981 --> 10:18.869
You had a daughter you
didn't tell me about.

10:21.612 --> 10:24.131
Makes it kinda hard to trust you.

10:27.368 --> 10:29.139
I understand.

10:57.774 --> 10:58.590
Eric!

10:58.951 --> 11:01.611
All the blood evidence on the scene H.

11:02.340 --> 11:05.585
That means that Dan Cofield
was shot right here.

11:05.585 --> 11:08.930
Yeah, traveled a half mile across town.

11:09.308 --> 11:11.291
Blood drops to the left of the tracks

11:11.291 --> 11:13.977
put him on the driver's
side of the radio car.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.689
So we have five rounds
missing from his magazine.

11:16.689 --> 11:19.489
Yeah, 9 mil, standard MDPD issue.

11:19.489 --> 11:22.593
The rounds are discharged
back and to the right,

11:22.593 --> 11:25.620
which means he used the
patrol car to shield himself.

11:28.871 --> 11:31.878
I found two other sets of tire tracks.

11:32.728 --> 11:34.290
Fresh rubber on all of them.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.253
Ok. Means they were in a hurry.

11:35.253 --> 11:37.098
Do we have a vehicle type?

11:37.098 --> 11:40.608
Dunno, farthest set's wide,
intricate tread.

11:40.608 --> 11:41.922
May be an expensive car,

11:41.922 --> 11:43.981
but definitely an expensive tyre.

11:43.981 --> 11:46.356
The others are single tread and narrow.

11:46.356 --> 11:48.005
Motorcycle and a high end car.

11:48.005 --> 11:49.739
What were they doing here?

11:49.739 --> 11:52.156
I dunno, nothing legal that's for sure.

11:52.156 --> 11:53.827
You think Cofield was
into something dirty?

11:53.827 --> 11:55.223
I don't know Eric.

11:55.223 --> 11:56.729
I hope not.

12:14.491 --> 12:15.509
What is it now?

12:15.509 --> 12:17.449
Just thought I'd return your watch.

12:17.449 --> 12:19.719
Well, it's nice of you to
go out of your way.

12:20.016 --> 12:22.720
You know Mr. Rutter,
I'm not entirely convinced that officer

12:22.720 --> 12:25.649
Cofield was angry at you for
the reasons you mentioned.

12:25.649 --> 12:27.665
There are no motorcycles on the lawn,

12:27.665 --> 12:29.136
there are no dogs.

12:29.136 --> 12:31.283
The blood on the watch isn't
yours or officer Cofield's.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.524
It's female.

12:32.817 --> 12:34.558
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:34.558 --> 12:36.101
Why did you lie?

12:36.954 --> 12:38.848
Who's that? Excuse me. Miss!

12:38.848 --> 12:40.397
Yeah, it's ok honey.

12:41.519 --> 12:44.387
Can I speak to you for a moment, outside?

12:47.383 --> 12:48.366
It's ok

12:50.991 --> 12:51.995
Here's your watch.

12:58.140 --> 12:59.529
My name's Calleigh,

12:59.529 --> 13:01.416
I'm with Miami-Dade PD.

13:01.416 --> 13:03.555
How did you hurt your lip?

13:05.818 --> 13:08.434
How did you hurt your lip?

13:11.662 --> 13:12.967
I fell down.

13:14.225 --> 13:16.075
Your hands aren't hurt.

13:16.075 --> 13:20.246
Didn't you try to protect
yourself when you fell?

13:22.420 --> 13:24.998
I'm sorry. I don't want any trouble.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.772
I'm sorry.

13:37.799 --> 13:39.748
If you need help.

13:56.567 --> 13:57.996
I got your page.

13:57.996 --> 13:59.565
You were right Calleigh.

13:59.565 --> 14:02.306
The DNA from your hankerchief,

14:02.306 --> 14:04.636
matches the DNA collected from the watch.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.898
I hate that.

14:05.898 --> 14:07.741
She won't talk because she's afraid.

14:07.741 --> 14:09.687
It's probably an illegal

14:09.687 --> 14:10.830
I guess officer Cofield tried to

14:10.830 --> 14:12.879
give Fred a taste of his own medicine.

14:12.879 --> 14:14.259
Is he our cop-killer?

14:14.259 --> 14:15.843
No, his alibi checks out.

14:15.843 --> 14:18.411
He's a sleezebag of a different variety.

14:18.675 --> 14:21.187
You know, I couldn't enter the
house under domestic violence,

14:21.187 --> 14:22.719
because I didn't have any hard evidence

14:22.719 --> 14:24.890
or the cooperation of the victim,

14:25.502 --> 14:28.005
but I think with this,
I could get him on assault.

15:08.922 --> 15:11.420
Hey, copied these for you.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.626
Got lucky on the gum from the radio car.

15:13.626 --> 15:14.681
Somebody left DNA?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.617
Hmm, three somebodies.

15:17.429 --> 15:18.519
You're kidding me.

15:18.519 --> 15:20.253
First donor is female, saliva.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.674
She's our gum chewer.

15:22.674 --> 15:23.979
Alright, CODISed it?

15:23.979 --> 15:25.193
Notta.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.546
Alright, how about the other two somebodies.

15:27.546 --> 15:30.858
Not saliva, not female.

15:31.877 --> 15:33.348
Semen?

15:34.326 --> 15:36.782
I guess we weren't the only
ones who got lucky.

15:36.782 --> 15:38.372
You would say that.

15:38.785 --> 15:41.222
Male samples got trapped in the gum.

15:41.222 --> 15:43.707
I'm thinking she chewed it after.

15:43.707 --> 15:45.526
Right, she's living dangerously.

15:45.768 --> 15:48.969
Probably some hooker lost
her gum during transport.

15:49.510 --> 15:53.263
Tamyra, the gum was found in the front seat.

15:58.561 --> 16:02.711
Why would he be transporting
a hooker in the front... oh.

16:04.141 --> 16:07.685
Listen hmm, you know, this cop, he's,

16:07.685 --> 16:09.812
he's got a family so...

16:09.812 --> 16:11.672
I'm a mute until the facts are in.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.192
Alright, thanks.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.076
Mrs. Cofield.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.278
Lieutenant.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.000
I appreciate you taking the time.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.814
Laurie, we are gonna find
out who did this to Dan.

16:34.814 --> 16:36.053
You have my word on it.

16:36.053 --> 16:37.717
I know you will.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.207
Dan loved his job very much.

16:41.475 --> 16:43.402
It's all he ever talked about.

16:43.402 --> 16:47.268
Well, he was a good man
and a great officer.

16:47.786 --> 16:49.315
Everyone's been really nice,

16:49.315 --> 16:50.932
the other wives.

16:51.957 --> 16:53.107
But,

16:53.957 --> 16:56.264
I've already heard things,

16:56.264 --> 16:59.011
about an IAB investigation.

16:59.940 --> 17:02.788
Well, an investigation like that

17:02.788 --> 17:06.044
is normal for this type of situation.

17:07.953 --> 17:10.444
Dan didn't tell me everything.

17:11.108 --> 17:13.490
If he was into something,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.897
I'm worried about the kids.

17:16.897 --> 17:19.002
If we loose Dan's pension.

17:19.357 --> 17:20.541
Oh, I'm sorry, / Ok.

17:20.541 --> 17:21.790
I know it sounds horrible.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.815
This is not easy.

17:23.815 --> 17:25.005
Here's what I want you to do.

17:25.005 --> 17:27.914
I want you to leave everything to me now.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.070
Excuse me.

17:33.566 --> 17:34.920
What do ya got?

17:36.655 --> 17:39.066
CODIS-hit on the gum Gary Neilson.

17:39.066 --> 17:42.250
He's in the system for sexual
assault back in 2000.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.980
- He lives in Belle harbour.
- Ok, perfect!

17:50.777 --> 17:52.439
It's a gimme right? / Sure

17:53.887 --> 17:55.170
Gary,

17:55.866 --> 17:57.814
you need to lock your elbows.

17:59.129 --> 18:00.676
Looking for a forth?

18:00.882 --> 18:02.596
Actually, we're looking for you.

18:03.602 --> 18:04.513
What for?

18:04.513 --> 18:06.718
Information on a murdered cop.

18:07.141 --> 18:08.651
Dan Cofield.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.340
Oh, I saw that in the news.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.242
That's horrible.

18:12.242 --> 18:14.658
We found your DNA inside a piece
of chewing gum

18:14.658 --> 18:17.367
inside officer Cofields car.

18:18.702 --> 18:20.122
I'm sorry, I was waiting for the punch line.

18:20.122 --> 18:22.926
This is no joke, I can assure you.

18:22.926 --> 18:25.687
Now you'd better tell them
to move on without you.

18:28.057 --> 18:31.507
I'll catch up with you at the club house
Alright!

18:35.063 --> 18:36.887
I wasn't in any police car.

18:36.887 --> 18:38.359
May be you weren't but your semen

18:38.359 --> 18:40.858
was inside your chewing gum.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.354
I was with a girl, alright?

18:46.354 --> 18:47.866
She has a piece of gum,

18:47.866 --> 18:49.060
you come and hassel me?

18:49.060 --> 18:51.547
Right now, our problem is a dead officer.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.644
I don't know anything about that.

18:52.644 --> 18:54.424
But you do know the girl.

18:55.725 --> 18:58.276
I used her services last night.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.549
Biggest mistake I ever made.

19:00.549 --> 19:01.541
What's her name?

19:01.541 --> 19:02.691
Like they give you the real one.

19:02.691 --> 19:04.285
Well, we'll take a fake on,

19:04.285 --> 19:06.582
and a location.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.593
Tiffany.

19:09.950 --> 19:12.455
137th. Overtown.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.642
See, that wasn't that hard

19:17.258 --> 19:18.711
Please, sit down.

19:20.677 --> 19:24.426
Tiffany, how well did you know officer Cofield.

19:24.426 --> 19:25.677
I didn't

19:25.677 --> 19:27.094
Cop's a cop.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.503
Officer Cofield's a little different.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.927
Oh my god.

19:33.801 --> 19:34.644
Now I remember him.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.175
Well you should, you were in his car

19:36.175 --> 19:38.857
last night right before he got murdered.

19:38.857 --> 19:40.043
No I wans't.

19:40.043 --> 19:41.822
Your gum says you were.

19:42.699 --> 19:45.128
Cops have to clean out their
cars after every shift.

19:45.128 --> 19:47.531
Which leaves a very small window.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.640
He said he wouldn't arrest me

19:52.640 --> 19:55.610
if, you know I took care of him.

19:58.555 --> 20:00.578
What exactly did he ask you to do?

20:00.578 --> 20:03.716
He had his thing just like any of them.

20:05.258 --> 20:07.205
He was nice though.

20:07.717 --> 20:09.253
Even paid me.

20:09.253 --> 20:11.806
You happen to have the
money that he used?

20:19.484 --> 20:21.520
300 bucks.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.585
That's all of it.

20:22.585 --> 20:27.310
Wow, that's a lot of cash for an
honest cop to be throwing around.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.277
Unless it wasn't for sex.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.003
Car's in the driveway.

20:45.994 --> 20:49.833
Mr. Rutter we have a warrant to
search the premises.

20:50.866 --> 20:52.515
Let's go around the back.

21:09.472 --> 21:11.907
Oh... / I've got him. Call it in.

21:15.237 --> 21:17.413
Bitch stabbed me and took off.

21:17.413 --> 21:19.608
An ambulance is on its way.

21:19.608 --> 21:20.552
What's her name?

21:20.552 --> 21:22.178
Anna Moralez.

21:22.437 --> 21:23.407
She got a job?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.998
She helps a friend out.

21:24.998 --> 21:26.196
Do you know her friend's name?

21:26.196 --> 21:27.297
Uh, Maria, Maria, something,

21:27.297 --> 21:29.346
they're always jabbering in Spanish.

21:29.346 --> 21:30.573
Woman named Maria in Miami!

21:30.573 --> 21:32.040
That narrows it down.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.264
Excuse me.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.349
Thank you.

21:39.349 --> 21:40.416
The man looks pretty cut and dried.

21:40.416 --> 21:41.448
Weapon on the ground,

21:41.448 --> 21:42.783
standard kitchen knife.

21:42.783 --> 21:44.178
Victim stabbed there,

21:44.178 --> 21:45.215
crawled from there to there,

21:45.215 --> 21:47.225
looks like he was going for the phone.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.137
Fresh paint.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.657
Excuse me?

21:50.657 --> 21:51.558
That's great.

21:51.558 --> 21:53.140
I appreciate your assessment.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.237
Unknown suspect fled in a hurry,

21:55.237 --> 21:56.354
possibly on foot.

21:56.354 --> 21:57.846
The suspect's not unknown.

21:57.846 --> 21:59.689
Her name is Anna Moralez,

21:59.689 --> 22:01.792
approximately 5'6, 110 pounds,

22:01.792 --> 22:03.337
black hair, brown eyes.

22:03.337 --> 22:04.205
First rule of thumb.

22:04.205 --> 22:06.018
Question a living victim if you've got one.

22:06.018 --> 22:07.839
They might be lying,
but at least it's a start

22:07.839 --> 22:10.337
Second thing,
put out a broadcast below.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.464
Oh, and officer,

22:13.464 --> 22:14.970
I don't believe I got your name.

22:14.970 --> 22:16.899
Aaron Jessup. and...

22:16.899 --> 22:19.248
Calleigh Ducane. CSI.

22:19.248 --> 22:21.212
Welcome to Miami-Dade PD.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.978
Yeah, soon as we can.

23:58.978 --> 24:00.086
Hey Rick,

24:00.690 --> 24:02.275
Rick, you got a minute?

24:02.275 --> 24:03.715
Yeah, excuse me?

24:03.715 --> 24:06.113
Since when do uniforms carry CI money?

24:06.113 --> 24:07.004
What are you talking about?

24:07.004 --> 24:08.695
Dan Cofield was running this girl

24:08.695 --> 24:10.855
as a confidential informant, wasn't he?

24:10.855 --> 24:12.169
I just found that out this morning.

24:12.169 --> 24:13.706
When were you going to tell me?

24:13.706 --> 24:15.545
What was Dan into?

24:17.579 --> 24:20.202
Cofield logged out the cash to pay the girl.

24:20.202 --> 24:21.357
He photocopied the serial numbers...

24:21.357 --> 24:23.569
I know the money is legitimate.

24:23.569 --> 24:25.934
The money is, but he may not be.

24:29.645 --> 24:31.297
Here you go. / Thank you.

24:39.483 --> 24:41.164
What are you talking about?

24:41.164 --> 24:42.847
IAB investigations are confidential.

24:42.847 --> 24:43.892
Strictly need to know.

24:43.892 --> 24:47.438
If I figure out that you're withholding
information from me Rick.

24:47.438 --> 24:51.361
This is about me dating your
brother's wife, isn't it?

24:53.951 --> 24:57.847
No, this is about your desire to
destroy a man's reputation,

24:57.847 --> 24:59.538
that's what this is about.

24:59.538 --> 25:01.569
The verdict is still out
on officer Cofield.

25:01.569 --> 25:03.912
Soon as I can clear his name, I will.

25:03.912 --> 25:04.881
I'm doing my job.

25:04.881 --> 25:07.773
And leaving a cop-killer on the street.

25:16.735 --> 25:18.613
Tiffany, you lied to me, didn't you?

25:18.613 --> 25:20.944
Officer Cofield said don't trust anyone.

25:20.944 --> 25:22.085
Hmm.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.857
Well, you're gonna have to
trust me now, won't ya?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.140
I can't help you.

25:26.140 --> 25:27.869
That is not true.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.598
Of course, you can.

25:30.879 --> 25:34.876
I wanna know who officer Cofield was after.

25:38.045 --> 25:39.911
Tiffany!

25:42.292 --> 25:44.592
Name's Jimmy Esario.

25:45.261 --> 25:47.895
Whenever I'd get a client in
a nice car, I'd call Jimmy.

25:47.895 --> 25:50.502
And Jimmy would car-jack the
misdealer car, right?

25:50.753 --> 25:53.125
Get out of the car. Get out the car now!

25:53.687 --> 25:56.823
Jimmmy's not the kinda guy
you ask a lot of questions.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.505
Paid me fifty bucks a call.

25:58.505 --> 26:02.520
Officer Cofield figured out what you
and Jimmy were doing, didn't he?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.033
Didn't he?

26:04.033 --> 26:06.048
But he didn't make me stop.

26:06.271 --> 26:10.319
He told me next time I tipped Jimmy
on a client, to call him first.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.506
What was this client's name?

26:16.999 --> 26:18.972
Is this man the client?

26:22.180 --> 26:24.510
I never look at their faces.

26:45.254 --> 26:47.232
Tiffany! / Hi.

26:48.614 --> 26:52.543
Hey Jimmy, got a live one
coming your way baby.

26:54.082 --> 26:55.485
Nice.

26:55.803 --> 26:59.205
Huh, thank you. / Welcome.

26:59.205 --> 27:00.934
Take care of yourself.

27:03.002 --> 27:04.282
Last I saw officer Cofield,

27:04.282 --> 27:06.490
he went after Jimmy in the Benz.

27:08.860 --> 27:09.719
Now what?

27:09.719 --> 27:11.126
You call Jimmy,

27:11.613 --> 27:15.120
and you tell Jimmy that you
have another car for him.

27:19.411 --> 27:21.632
Subject is approaching the vehicle.

27:22.519 --> 27:23.928
Ok. Easy.

27:23.928 --> 27:25.757
Wait for my signal.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.984
Go, go go!

27:34.111 --> 27:35.421
Don't move. Get up.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.002
Get your hands up.

27:38.536 --> 27:40.401
Jimmy. / Get your hands up.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.357
Watch it, easy.

27:47.336 --> 27:50.052
Whoa, that's a nasty burn
you got on your ear.

27:50.052 --> 27:52.384
Did you get that shooting it out
with a cop you killed Jimmy?

27:52.384 --> 27:55.142
When he tried to stop
you from taking the Benz.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.019
Alright, alright, hey.

27:58.201 --> 27:59.694
So we jacked the Benz,

27:59.694 --> 28:02.445
I didn't kill nobody. I swear.

28:02.445 --> 28:07.564
Jimmy, where is the car right now?

28:22.547 --> 28:24.466
Get down!Get down

28:36.403 --> 28:39.865
Get down on the ground right now.

28:41.815 --> 28:43.516
That's the car, H.

28:43.516 --> 28:44.978
That's it.

28:49.642 --> 28:52.439
Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?

28:53.032 --> 28:55.700
I don't mean to bump on
officer Cofield's case

28:55.700 --> 28:57.385
but the woman that this belongs to,

28:57.385 --> 28:58.635
her name is Anna Moralez,

28:58.635 --> 29:01.528
and I can't find her on
public record anywhere.

29:01.528 --> 29:04.549
So you think that apron's gonna
tell you where she's been.

29:04.549 --> 29:06.146
Or where she's going to be.

29:06.146 --> 29:09.508
I found corn husks and
parchment paper in her house.

29:09.508 --> 29:10.965
I think she makes tomalleys for

29:10.965 --> 29:14.395
a mobile food truck
company called Sonrisa.

29:14.395 --> 29:16.123
Why don't you just pick her up?

29:16.123 --> 29:18.499
Well, because there's about thirty trucks

29:18.499 --> 29:20.573
scattered throughout the county.

29:20.573 --> 29:23.726
Besides, when I asked them,
they said they never heard of her.

29:24.194 --> 29:27.715
They probably don't have the
most legit employment records.

29:27.715 --> 29:29.749
I found a piece of paper in her pocket

29:29.749 --> 29:32.152
and written on it were the numbers

29:32.152 --> 29:35.390
8, 17 and 24.

29:35.390 --> 29:36.673
I'm thinking they're bus routes.

29:36.673 --> 29:39.497
Well, that narrows it down to South Miami.

29:39.497 --> 29:42.285
I'm hoping to narrow it down further.

30:23.336 --> 30:25.230
It's the same thing on every slide.

30:25.230 --> 30:27.818
There's one substance that
covered the entire apron.

30:27.818 --> 30:30.618
Salt? / Well, it's not table salt.

30:30.618 --> 30:33.244
It's unprocessed. / Sea salt?

30:33.552 --> 30:34.999
She didn't get it from cooking.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.192
No, but she did get it on the job.

30:37.192 --> 30:38.205
Where are you going?

30:38.205 --> 30:40.352
To grab an early dinner. Thank you.

30:40.786 --> 30:42.085
Thank you.

30:54.970 --> 30:56.690
Buenas Tardes
(=Good afternoon or Good evening)

30:59.471 --> 31:00.636
May I help you?

31:00.636 --> 31:01.530
Yes you can.

31:01.530 --> 31:03.187
Is your name Maria?

31:04.476 --> 31:07.205
I am here to see your friend Anna Morales

31:10.464 --> 31:14.236
Juana, la seniora...

31:18.775 --> 31:21.623
You are here to arrest me, aren't you?

31:21.623 --> 31:23.631
You speak English?

31:25.347 --> 31:28.226
If, if he knew I was learning,

31:30.484 --> 31:33.316
Is he... / Alive, yes.

31:33.316 --> 31:35.115
He's gonna be fine.

31:36.744 --> 31:38.671
I tried to leave.

31:38.671 --> 31:40.816
Many times/you don't have to explain.

31:40.816 --> 31:44.618
wh.. when I came here I had nothing.

31:44.618 --> 31:47.984
But he had a home.

31:50.549 --> 31:53.816
Anna, are you injured anywhere else?

31:59.196 --> 32:03.781
No marks but I hurt here. / May I?

32:08.256 --> 32:09.798
What did he do to you?

32:11.744 --> 32:13.212
It's okay.

32:14.185 --> 32:16.367
Will you come with me to the hospital?

32:16.367 --> 32:21.130
I don't have papers.

32:21.130 --> 32:22.810
Anna, even if you aren't documented,

32:22.810 --> 32:25.541
you are human being and have rights.

32:27.022 --> 32:28.691
And I'll go with you.

32:32.639 --> 32:34.764
Gary, we found your car.

32:35.904 --> 32:37.414
That's great.

32:37.604 --> 32:39.922
You work fast. / Yes, we do.

32:39.922 --> 32:44.431
The gentlemen who stole it
admitted to car jacking you.

32:44.431 --> 32:45.834
Car jacking?

32:45.834 --> 32:48.238
That car was stolen from
my parking garage.

32:48.238 --> 32:50.736
I filed a police report this morning.

32:54.746 --> 32:57.944
You were there when the cop
was murdered, weren't you?

32:59.275 --> 33:00.614
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:00.614 --> 33:02.384
If you don't come forward Gary,

33:02.384 --> 33:06.522
his killers go free.
Is that what you want?

33:06.522 --> 33:08.675
I wasn't there.

33:09.851 --> 33:11.431
Yes you were.

33:11.431 --> 33:13.761
And I'm gonna prove it.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.997
Miss Ducane. / Calleigh.

33:25.997 --> 33:28.338
My TO says you requested to see me.

33:28.338 --> 33:30.816
I thought you might wanna
see this one through.

33:35.671 --> 33:37.403
I found Anna.

33:37.403 --> 33:39.883
She's getting medical help.

33:39.883 --> 33:42.071
Fred Rutter's has been beating her.

33:42.430 --> 33:43.526
How?

33:44.325 --> 33:46.447
That's up to us to find out.

33:51.583 --> 33:55.590
Okay, just remember theories are great.

33:55.590 --> 33:57.876
But it all comes back to the evidence.

33:57.876 --> 34:00.374
Is that a tooth? / Mm-hmm

34:04.506 --> 34:07.116
And anything can mean something.

34:13.018 --> 34:14.885
What do you notice?

34:16.677 --> 34:19.831
Laundary bag, soap.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.030
Look over there. Sash cord.

34:23.641 --> 34:26.210
Great. Put it in context.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.980
Simple house hold items
turned into a weapon.

34:30.784 --> 34:32.678
Tell the cop anything?

34:32.678 --> 34:34.455
you're lying, you're lying,

34:35.716 --> 34:36.924
you're lying,

34:38.467 --> 34:40.362
I know you're lying.

34:44.790 --> 34:45.884
Come here.

34:47.107 --> 34:48.667
He unwrapped each individual soap bar

34:48.667 --> 34:50.429
and tied the bag off with the sash cord.

34:50.429 --> 34:51.920
Shows premeditation.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.695
Used a deadly weapon.

34:53.695 --> 34:56.054
Makes the charge aggravated battery,

34:56.054 --> 34:57.809
up and into a second degree felony

34:57.809 --> 35:00.251
You just tied in years into a sentence

35:00.251 --> 35:01.868
Great job, man.

35:06.513 --> 35:08.737
Mr. Rutter / Hey.

35:10.796 --> 35:12.431
I hope you got her.

35:12.431 --> 35:14.882
- Lucky I didn't die.
- Yeah I found Anna.

35:14.882 --> 35:16.468
I also found out evidence in your home

35:16.468 --> 35:18.784
that proves you've been beating her.

35:19.406 --> 35:20.866
What are you talking about?

35:21.495 --> 35:24.438
Oh, uh, oh.. You mean her lip.

35:24.886 --> 35:26.907
Come on, give me a break.
She's... she's clumsy.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.743
I know that you beat her
with a weigthed bag

35:28.743 --> 35:31.573
and I guess that you thought
you were being smart.

35:31.573 --> 35:34.184
If you don't see it, it doesn't exist.

35:34.184 --> 35:36.664
But what you don't know is
that she's bleeding internally.

35:36.664 --> 35:38.965
She has abdominal trauma.

35:38.965 --> 35:40.569
See, the thing about bruises,

35:40.569 --> 35:43.950
the normal bruises occur when
vessels break underneath the skin.

35:43.950 --> 35:45.448
But hers are in the muscles.

35:46.224 --> 35:47.867
you're lying, you're lying

35:51.422 --> 35:54.573
It's gonna take a day or two
for them to rise to the surface.

35:54.573 --> 35:57.234
And they'll darken and
we'll photograph them.

35:57.234 --> 35:59.870
And juries love photographs.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.853
She will never testify against me.

36:05.458 --> 36:08.645
She may, or she may not.
But it's beside the point.

36:08.645 --> 36:10.479
The evidences will speak for her.

36:10.479 --> 36:12.867
She stabbed me.

36:12.867 --> 36:15.016
The interesting thing
about these two crimes

36:15.016 --> 36:18.213
is that I've got enough on
you for aggravated battery.

36:18.213 --> 36:21.948
But for her, just self-defense.

36:22.317 --> 36:23.592
Cuff him.

36:24.219 --> 36:25.766
Are you out of your mind?

36:25.766 --> 36:27.501
She's not even American.

36:27.501 --> 36:28.888
What kind of system is this?

36:28.888 --> 36:30.960
I guess you're about to find out.

37:33.442 --> 37:35.891
Pulled a.22 out of Gary's car.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.950
No match on IBIS.
Gun's not in the system.

37:38.950 --> 37:42.483
The.22 is registerd to Gary Neilson's wife.

37:42.483 --> 37:46.441
Smart. An ex-con like Gary
knows he can't own a gun

37:47.289 --> 37:48.874
Why would he shoot inside his own car?

37:48.874 --> 37:51.661
Maybe he wasn't alone in the car.

37:52.877 --> 37:55.401
Close quarters,
those burns on Jimmy's ear.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.410
How do we prove Gary pulled the trigger?

38:00.410 --> 38:02.147
The old-fashioned way.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.396
I already told you.

38:03.396 --> 38:06.402
My car was take from my garage.

38:06.727 --> 38:10.709
Yes, according to your parking card Gary,

38:10.709 --> 38:12.806
you didn't make it home last night.

38:12.806 --> 38:15.483
Okay, so I must've parked on the street.

38:15.483 --> 38:18.018
Need I remind you that
filing a false police report

38:18.018 --> 38:20.805
is punishable by jail time.

38:20.805 --> 38:22.639
So you wanna try again?

38:26.917 --> 38:29.606
All right. Uh...

38:33.166 --> 38:35.363
After I dropped off the girl,

38:35.719 --> 38:39.692
I was on my way home and
these two guys came out nowhere.

38:45.915 --> 38:47.029
Get out the car!

38:47.029 --> 38:49.589
Get out of the car! Now! Go!

38:52.884 --> 38:55.997
But that's all that happened.
I didn't see any shooting.

38:58.251 --> 38:59.603
Okay.

39:00.335 --> 39:03.172
I bet you didn't hear any either, did you?

39:04.126 --> 39:05.615
What's that?

39:06.541 --> 39:10.715
Gary I'm gonna ask you to take a test, okay?

39:29.459 --> 39:30.921
So what've we got?

39:30.921 --> 39:34.315
Pure tone test indicates significant injuries
to his ear drums.

39:34.315 --> 39:35.759
Lucky for him it's only temporary.

39:35.759 --> 39:37.497
Okay. But he does have hearing loss.

39:37.497 --> 39:39.284
Mm-hm. Short term.

39:39.284 --> 39:43.294
Probably caused by exposure to
something in the 140 decibel range.

39:43.294 --> 39:47.999
- That's a jet engine.
- Jet engine or a gun shot.

39:48.848 --> 39:50.532
Right, Gary?

39:52.395 --> 39:54.046
Give me a minute, will ya?

40:00.788 --> 40:02.451
So I don't hear so well.

40:02.451 --> 40:04.244
And this test Gary,

40:04.244 --> 40:06.643
confirms that you got the officer killed.

40:06.643 --> 40:07.733
That's ridiculous.

40:07.733 --> 40:10.865
You weren't in that car alone, were you?

40:15.537 --> 40:17.374
Get out the car!

40:23.181 --> 40:24.083
Miami dade police.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.675
Put your hands where I can see them, now!

40:26.675 --> 40:28.186
Officer Cofield,

40:28.186 --> 40:30.481
had the situation under control.

40:30.481 --> 40:33.368
And then you went and got stupid

40:59.843 --> 41:02.026
I only fired one shot.

41:02.026 --> 41:03.500
I was trying to defend myself.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.519
It's called contagious gun fire.

41:05.519 --> 41:07.283
And if you hadn't started shooting,

41:07.283 --> 41:09.033
none of this would have happened.

41:09.033 --> 41:11.244
- I didn't do anything.
- It's exactly right.

41:11.244 --> 41:13.533
When you should have used
a radio to call for a help.

41:13.533 --> 41:15.350
But you didn't do it.

41:23.447 --> 41:24.823
Hey

41:24.823 --> 41:26.596
I don't have to report a crime.

41:27.271 --> 41:28.567
There's no law against that.

41:28.567 --> 41:29.804
It's true.

41:29.804 --> 41:32.986
But now you're gonna have to live with it.

41:42.311 --> 41:44.027
Look.

41:44.027 --> 41:47.019
I will testify about the car-jacking

41:47.019 --> 41:50.451
and the shooting,
just not about the girl.

41:51.447 --> 41:54.014
You've just commited a felony
by concealing a weapon.

41:54.014 --> 41:58.181
The girl is the least of your problems.

42:08.881 --> 42:10.349
Hi, dad.

42:11.090 --> 42:12.679
Yeah, I know.

42:13.153 --> 42:14.776
No, I'm fine.

42:16.471 --> 42:18.202
Hey dad, listen.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.808
I have a great case for you.

42:21.253 --> 42:22.851
Her name's Anna

42:25.090 --> 42:27.065
Hey / Hey

42:27.065 --> 42:28.903
What are you doing her?

42:30.896 --> 42:32.427
Hello / Hey

42:32.788 --> 42:33.949
Horatio.

42:33.949 --> 42:35.512
Heard you caught Dan Cofield's killer.

42:35.512 --> 42:37.217
- Yeah, that's right.
- Congratulations,

42:37.217 --> 42:38.549
I'm sure we'll end up clearing him.

42:38.549 --> 42:41.509
If his family doesn't get full benefits,
you are gonna hear from me.

42:41.509 --> 42:42.573
Don't hate me, hate the job.

42:42.573 --> 42:44.217
I'll take that into consideration

42:44.217 --> 42:45.181
No hard feelings, right?

42:45.181 --> 42:47.237
No, absolutely not.

42:47.237 --> 42:48.581
Okay, I'm gonna lock up my office,

42:48.581 --> 42:50.840
and I'll see you downstairs. / Okay.

42:51.686 --> 42:52.925
You take care.

42:52.925 --> 42:55.409
Yeah. You, too.

42:58.938 --> 43:00.265
I'm sure that Dan Cofield's widow

43:00.265 --> 43:03.045
will appreciate everything you've done.

43:03.045 --> 43:06.068
Well, I just let the evidence clear his name.

43:06.670 --> 43:10.672
Still, she's lucky to have you.

43:10.672 --> 43:12.301
Thank you.

43:14.819 --> 43:16.646
See you tomorrow.
