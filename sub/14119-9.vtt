01:46.674 --> 01:49.508
He's going crazy. I told you
this was going to happen.

01:49.510 --> 01:53.112
He's gonna murder us all.
He's like that tiger
and we're Siegfried and Roy.

I knew it was
only a matter of time.

I'm not going
to eat you, Pigeon.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.967
Oh, there's no team,
it's just me.

02:48.969 --> 02:53.105
I call it the "Mike Tyson
Mystery Team" because of
a copyright situation.

02:53.107 --> 02:56.208
So, you were saying you can't
get a second date, huh?

02:56.210 --> 02:57.543
Any ideas why?

02:57.545 --> 02:59.244
Well, I do have one theory...

02:59.246 --> 03:00.946
Mmm-hmm. I'm listening.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.383
I think there's
a very strong possibility,

03:04.385 --> 03:05.651
that I'm a werewolf.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.785
Mmm.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.153
I keep waking up
in the morning,

03:08.155 --> 03:10.656
covered in blood
with no memory
of the night before.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.758
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.295
So, what I think is happening
is that I'm eating
these women.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.529
Uh-oh.

03:18.464 --> 03:19.798
We're all outta pie.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.633
Did you hear anything I said?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.368
-Excuse me!
-Can I help you?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.170
I think I'm gonna need
more pie.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.039
What do you like better?

03:27.041 --> 03:30.375
The key lime pie
or the chocolate pudding pie?

03:30.377 --> 03:34.279
Ooh-wie.
Or a Cherry Jubilee pie?

03:34.281 --> 03:35.847
Well, they're,
they're all good.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.449
Yeah, but if you had
to choose?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.518
MAN: Uh, I like the key lime.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.653
Really? More than
the Cherry Jubilee?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.056
(STUTTERING)
Well, I personally
don't like cherry.

03:44.058 --> 03:47.059
MIKE: Yeah, but if you did
you'd probably pick
the Cherry Jubilee, right?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.360
No brainer.

03:48.362 --> 03:51.964
Oh, hold up. Snicker pie.
What the (BLEEP)
is a Snicker pie?

03:51.966 --> 03:54.566
It's like a chocolate pie
made with a Snicker bar.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.702
Ooh-wie!
I gotta have a slice of that.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.904
No, (BLEEP),
bring me the whole pie.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.406
And bring me
some of the samples
of the other ones too.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.275
I'm sorry.
We don't give samples.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.644
Just whatever pie
you're gonna throw out
back there.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.912
Give it to me and Andrew.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.116

Who doesn't like cherries?

for Halloween. You're a...

04:25.465 --> 04:26.665
Where'd you go?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.267
Oh, I went to go meet, Andrew.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.935

wait for us?

I'm too full.

What? When did you eat?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.880
I mean I'm too,
I mean I'm too full
of good ideas.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.882
As to how I'm gonna
solve this mystery.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.984
I think Yung should go
on a date with Andrew

04:45.986 --> 04:47.586
and see what's wrong with him.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.355
I don't wanna go
on a date with him.
What if he's a weirdo?

04:50.357 --> 04:51.690
Honey, I met with him.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.325
There's nothing weird
about him.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.860
I mean, he's dull as can be.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.995
I barely remember
anything that he said.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.598
Come on, it'll be fun.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.999
Seriously?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.836
Okay, I know you think
this is a waste of time,

05:04.838 --> 05:08.573
but trust me, Yung,
image is important. Okay?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.776
Whether
you're solving a mystery,

05:10.778 --> 05:15.647
or looking for Mr. Right,
or in this case, maybe both.

"Ugh" all you want
but I know fashion.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.188
but you're never gonna see

down the runway.
You're just not.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.995
There! What do you think?

05:31.964 --> 05:34.866
And don't say you need
a walking stick
because you don't.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.402
Ah, well, maybe you do.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.139
Oh, yeah.
You needed the walking stick.

to get worried.

Are you eating butter?

06:10.571 --> 06:13.638

I don't know.
I don't remember, why?

by a werewolf,

10:07.206 --> 10:08.707
(SCREAMING)

10:13.646 --> 10:15.380
Yung, it's me. Andrew.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.049
I came to tell you
that was the best date
of my life.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.551
And even though
I'm a werewolf,

10:19.553 --> 10:22.887
I hope you'll give me
the one thing
I've never had before...

10:23.623 --> 10:24.889
A second date.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.225
Of course, I will.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.261
(KISSING)

10:31.230 --> 10:34.265
Oh, I guess the other
antidote is true...

10:34.267 --> 10:35.600
-(GUNSHOT)
-(GASPS)

10:35.602 --> 10:37.268
-(GROANS)
-(GASPS)

10:37.870 --> 10:40.038
Well, at least
that nightmare's over.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.574
Now, who wants to go celebrate
at Nona's Pie house?

10:43.576 --> 10:47.078
I'm going to grab
some salted butter
to tie us over in the car.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.485
So, that's like murder, right?

11:12.204 --> 11:13.705
(HOWLING)

11:13.707 --> 11:16.307
Werewolf, my ass!
He's no damn werewolf!

11:17.109 --> 11:19.778
He's a wolf that's weird.
(CHUCKLES)
