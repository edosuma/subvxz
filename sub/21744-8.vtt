00:31.907 --> 00:34.201
VINCENT: <i>Congratulations</i>
<i>on your big win, Kai.</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:36.662
I couldn't be more proud.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.748
I have to stay sharp.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.292
For the men.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.838
How's your leg?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.923
It's, uh, it's stiff.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.175
But it's good.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.219
I'll live.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.684
I got your edible arrangement
in the hospital, by the way.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.936
It was very thoughtful.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.021
I figured the reason you didn't
come visit me yourself

01:03.105 --> 01:05.023
was because you were ashamed.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.527
I mean, it was your patient
who colluded with the woman

01:08.610 --> 01:09.820
who tried to murder me.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.738
(sighs)

01:11.822 --> 01:13.949
Allyson Mayfair-Richards
is a sick woman.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.706
But you're not far off,
I was ashamed.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.292
I mean, you've accomplished
so much, Kai.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.879
Running for office,
starting a whole movement.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.923
And I didn't know
about any of it.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.843
I'm just proud of you.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.181
I don't need you
to play Dad, Vincent.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.266
You're just as bad at it
as he was.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.517
I look after myself.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.727
You think that I want to be

01:41.810 --> 01:43.270
like that prick, Kai?

01:43.353 --> 01:44.646
No.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.858
I'm-I'm trying to apologize.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.235
Listen, what you are
doing here--

01:50.319 --> 01:52.988
organizing all of these people,

01:53.071 --> 01:55.449
making a difference--
it's awesome.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.871
You think so?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.789
Absolutely.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.167
And I want to help you
get your message out.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.211
With the right strategy,

02:07.294 --> 02:09.505
this could be
a national movement.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.133
-Yes.
-Yes.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.886
You know, I was thinking
about making some videos

02:15.969 --> 02:17.054
for social media.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.430
-(snaps fingers)
-That's genius.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.973
And I-I could film it.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.149
Thanks, big bro.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.193
Of course.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.946
Oh, there's just one more thing
I need from you.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.823
From now on,
call me Councilman.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.948
(low chatter)

04:09.708 --> 04:12.920
-Enjoy your meal.
-(spits)

04:13.003 --> 04:15.172
I'm not eating this shit.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.300
Kai told us to start making you
healthy food.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.428
(laughs) You bitches
are so sensitive.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.223
You know, your bangability

04:24.306 --> 04:27.100
would go way up
if you just smiled.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.896
Ooh.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.731
(laughter)

04:34.983 --> 04:36.443
(knife clatters)

04:38.779 --> 04:41.031
GUTTERBALL: She does have
a nice ass, though.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.247
I can't put up with this <i>shit</i>
much longer!

04:48.330 --> 04:50.582
I'm being treated like a servant
in my own restaurant.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.085
How did this Handmaid shit
even happen?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.878
48 hours ago,
we were on the verge

04:54.962 --> 04:56.296
of toppling the patriarchy!

04:56.380 --> 04:58.632
That's before he had
a goddamn army.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.883
That's not an army!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.051
That's a bunch of dude-bros

05:01.134 --> 05:02.344
with too much time
on their hands.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.221
Yeah? Tell that to
the other city council members.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.556
You weren't at that meeting
last night.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.484
That's six votes in favor.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.280
Perry?

05:25.367 --> 05:29.454
I understand the appeal
of private security,

05:29.538 --> 05:31.957
but we already have
a police force,

05:32.040 --> 05:34.585
not to mention countless community

05:34.668 --> 05:36.879
neighborhood watch groups.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.547
Do we really want to spend
taxpayer money

05:38.630 --> 05:40.632
to put more men with guns

05:40.716 --> 05:43.177
on the streets
in our neighborhoods?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.721
That makes me uncomfortable.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.850
Really?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.436
I know you live
in a gated community.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.772
Not everyone can afford that.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.650
And even your two beautiful
daughters have to leave

05:58.734 --> 06:00.986
those gates to go to school,
don't they?

06:01.236 --> 06:03.530
12 and 16, am I right?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.115
Now, just how comfortable

06:05.199 --> 06:08.994
would you feel
if something terrible

06:09.077 --> 06:10.746
were to happen to them?

06:10.829 --> 06:12.915
You'd never forgive yourself,
would you?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.084
I vote yes.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.046
KAI: And with that,
the motion passes.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.714
(gavel bangs)

06:20.797 --> 06:23.550
BEVERLY: <i>We let this shit go</i>
<i>too far already.</i>

06:23.634 --> 06:25.052
But I've been thinking
about this.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.887
Those boys are just grunts.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.057
They don't so much as take
a shit unless he tells them to.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.558
But if we cut off the head
of the snake,

06:32.434 --> 06:34.561
the entire army falls.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.898
You can't go after Kai.
It'd be a suicide mission.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.650
And I don't just mean us,
I mean the movement.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.901
We need him.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.444
Why do you keep on
defending him?

06:42.528 --> 06:45.656
Look, I'm not happy about being
put on kitchen duty, either,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.325
but it's all part
of his larger plan.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.035
There is no plan.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.829
He is not fit to lead.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.456
-You don't know him.
-You have to decide

06:54.540 --> 06:57.459
if you are with us
or against us.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.920
You think big brother's
gonna spare you?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.964
Reward your loyalty?

07:02.214 --> 07:03.632
Wake up, little girl.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.008
Kai's gonna do whatever
he needs to do

07:05.092 --> 07:06.510
to get what he wants,

07:06.593 --> 07:09.263
even if that includes
sacrificing baby sis.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.348
He does not give a shit
about you.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.975
You're wrong!

07:13.225 --> 07:14.601
Kai would never hurt me.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.645
I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for him.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.983
WINTER: <i>It was two years ago.</i>
<i>Halloween.</i>

07:21.275 --> 07:22.860
<i>We were doing</i>
<i>what we always did:</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:26.029
<i>trolling the social justice</i>
<i>warriors.</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:27.114
<i>But that was too easy.</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:30.951
"Why should we allow abortion

07:31.034 --> 07:34.037
"for the health of the mother

07:34.121 --> 07:38.166
"when the baby is the only part
of that duo

07:38.250 --> 07:39.793
without sin?"

07:39.877 --> 07:42.296
(laughing)

07:42.379 --> 07:44.882
KAI: "Kill the mother,
save the baby."

07:44.965 --> 07:48.177
WINTER: <i>We hit the jackpot</i>
<i>in the Dark Web.</i>

07:48.260 --> 07:50.762
<i>We would pretend to be one</i>
<i>of the true believers,</i>

07:50.846 --> 07:53.182
<i>then we would go farther than</i>
<i>anyone could possibly go.</i>

07:53.265 --> 07:56.476
Wait, I got one.
Okay...

07:56.560 --> 08:00.564
"Man can never escape
from temptation

08:00.647 --> 08:03.692
"because, in birth,
he passes through the vagina,

08:03.775 --> 08:06.737
"which has been desecrated
by the filthy act

08:06.820 --> 08:08.363
of sexual intercourse."
(smacks lips)

08:08.447 --> 08:09.865
-(laughs) Get out.
-(message alert chimes)

08:09.948 --> 08:11.074
<i>That was when we got</i>
<i>a private message from someone</i>

08:11.158 --> 08:12.326
<i>named Pastor Charles.</i>

08:12.409 --> 08:14.036
"You are worthy
of an invitation"?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.370
-Wait, from who?
-Yes!

08:15.454 --> 08:16.538
These people are dangerous, Kai.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.623
KAI:
They're posers.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.832
Messing with them in person

08:18.916 --> 08:20.542
will be a million times
more fun.

08:20.626 --> 08:24.505
KAI: Whoa! Judgment House?

08:24.588 --> 08:26.089
We're going.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.468
WINTER: <i>Judgment House turned</i>
<i>out to be a farm in Wixom</i>

08:29.551 --> 08:31.845
<i>near Highway 96.</i>

08:32.804 --> 08:35.182
Time to see the animals
in their cages.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.059
Where's everyone else?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.144
(door creaks)

08:40.729 --> 08:41.939
Hello, brother.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.441
Pastor Charles, I presume.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.527
I brought my sister, Winter.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.945
What is this place?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.864
Oh, it's a house of mirth to some.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.910
The portent to those whose eyes
are open but cannot see.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.250
Once you enter, you agree
to never share the provenance

09:01.333 --> 09:03.961
of what you've seen inside.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.215
Our secret to have and to hold.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.008
Till death do us part?

09:11.802 --> 09:14.638
Punishment is your
everlasting soul.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.140
(door creaks shut)

09:19.142 --> 09:21.061
I'm the watchman.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.480
This way.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.830
(door closes)

09:46.253 --> 09:47.921
(door slams shut)

09:48.463 --> 09:50.507
Shit. The door's locked.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.009
Well...

09:53.886 --> 09:55.095
...only one way to go.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.144
(flames whooshing)

10:02.227 --> 10:03.645
(recording of baby crying)

10:03.729 --> 10:06.607
PASTOR CHARLES (over speaker):
<i>Who shall speak for the unborn?</i>

10:06.690 --> 10:07.900
(recording of baby crying continues)

10:07.983 --> 10:10.736
WOMAN (moaning):
Help me. Help me.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.448
I killed my baby.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.285
Now I'm bleeding to death.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.661
(whimpers)

10:19.745 --> 10:21.079
Bummer.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.374
(quietly)
Help me, please.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.586
He kidnapped me.
He's making me do this.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.047
This isn't a show.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.965
(cries)
This is not a show.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.760
-What the fuck?
-She's really good.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.011
-(whimpering) No, no.
-You're good.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.888
-(sobbing)
-This... Jesus Christ.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.598
(sniffs)

10:39.681 --> 10:41.266
(sobbing)

10:41.350 --> 10:42.434
This is real blood.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.186
(sobbing)
Help me.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.313
Help me.

10:47.356 --> 10:48.774
PASTOR CHARLES:
<i>Wide is the gate</i>

10:48.857 --> 10:51.193
and broad the way

10:51.276 --> 10:53.570
which leadeth to destruction.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.531
(buzzing)

10:58.825 --> 11:00.327
WINTER: <i>We got to get</i>
<i>out of here. Come on.</i>

11:00.410 --> 11:02.788
KAI: <i>Whoa, whoa, wait, wait,</i>
<i>wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

11:02.871 --> 11:04.122
(woman whimpering)

11:04.206 --> 11:05.249
-Shit!
-(panting)

11:05.332 --> 11:07.084
WINTER:
<i>I knew after the first room,</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:08.794
<i>that what we saw was real.</i>

11:11.630 --> 11:13.549
<i>Not actors in a haunted house.</i>

11:13.799 --> 11:16.009
It smells like death in here.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.563
PASTOR CHARLES: Behold
the whirlwind of the Lord.

11:27.646 --> 11:31.108
It shall fall with pain
upon the head of the wicked.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.402
KAI:
He's alive.

11:39.575 --> 11:40.951
Hey, man.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.664
-(screaming)
-Aah!

11:46.164 --> 11:47.666
No more.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.837
He's corrupted me
by the drugs of my choice:

11:51.920 --> 11:55.841
ecstasy, cocaine, opioids.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.510
My body is a bag of mush.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.513
I'm dying from the inside out.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.723
WINTER:
Oh, my God.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.725
Get the fuck out of here.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.603
What of the sodomite?

12:07.686 --> 12:09.062
(loud bang, door creaks open)

12:12.316 --> 12:14.735
MAN: (sobbing quietly)
Help me, please.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.533
Please...

12:21.617 --> 12:23.952
you got to get me out of here.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.330
The seducer of the innocent...

12:26.663 --> 12:30.334
toward the wicked filth
of strange flesh.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.170
-Did the Lord not say...
<i>-Come on, Kai, we have to go.</i>

12:33.253 --> 12:34.254
No!

12:34.338 --> 12:36.298
<i>...that man shall not</i>
<i>lie with man as with woman?</i>

12:36.590 --> 12:39.760
-He can't do this to people.
-It is an abomination!

12:39.843 --> 12:42.137
<i>The blood shall be</i>
<i>on their heads.</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:46.225
<i>The Lord destroyed</i>
Sodom and Gomorrah

12:46.308 --> 12:48.143
<i>with fire and brimstone.</i>

12:48.227 --> 12:50.479
Behold, His judgment is...

12:50.938 --> 12:53.982
<i>it is ever swift and divine!</i>

12:54.316 --> 12:55.943
<i>And in uncertain times,</i>

12:56.026 --> 12:58.070
<i>-what vengeance</i>
-When he finishes talking...

12:58.153 --> 12:59.363
<i>shall mark their days?</i>

12:59.446 --> 13:01.323
...knives will burst
through my chest.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.450
PASTOR CHARLES:
<i>A plague to slow their way...</i>

13:03.534 --> 13:05.369
MAN: I saw it happen
to the guy before me.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.788
...or the strike
of swift justice!

13:08.205 --> 13:09.790
-Holy shit.
-I don't want to see this anymore.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.500
No, we have
to get him out of here.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.669
PASTOR CHARLES: <i>His judgment</i>
is ever swift!

13:13.752 --> 13:14.878
Help me!

13:14.962 --> 13:16.505
PASTOR CHARLES (softly):
<i>His punishment</i>

13:16.588 --> 13:19.883
<i>a slow... burning...</i>

13:19.967 --> 13:21.510
fire.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.803
(trembling breath)

13:24.137 --> 13:26.223
MAN: (whimpering)
<i>Oh, my God. Hurry.</i>

13:27.182 --> 13:29.059
(man trembling, panting)

13:29.142 --> 13:31.311
Go get help. We're getting
everyone out of here.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.105
Now!

13:36.733 --> 13:37.985
Come on.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.867
(quietly) Shit.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.911
WINTER: No...

14:00.757 --> 14:01.967
Shit.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.475
Yes. I see in your eyes

14:10.559 --> 14:12.144
a true connection

14:12.227 --> 14:14.479
to the wretched souls in here.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.527
I think you need to be
in the show.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.531
-(thump)
-(grunts)

14:24.615 --> 14:25.908
(gasps softly)

14:28.035 --> 14:30.078
KAI:
<i>Okay, you sick bastard,</i>

14:30.162 --> 14:32.122
this girl you kidnapped
after her appointment

14:32.206 --> 14:33.332
at Planned Parenthood,

14:33.415 --> 14:35.209
and all she had was a UTI.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.128
This guy, you took from rehab

14:38.212 --> 14:40.130
when he was trying to sober up.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.466
And my friend here
was at an AIDS clinic

14:42.549 --> 14:44.301
volunteering his time.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.429
How many people
have you condemned

14:47.513 --> 14:49.348
for no reason?

14:51.308 --> 14:53.519
I do not answer

14:53.602 --> 14:55.729
to you or your laws.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.523
GIRL:
We're gonna call

14:57.606 --> 15:00.067
the police, and then
you're going to prison.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.569
KAI:
That's not justice.

15:02.653 --> 15:05.113
He doesn't deserve anything less

15:05.531 --> 15:08.116
than what he was willing
to put you through.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.711
I say we do what's right.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.215
Winter?

15:23.298 --> 15:25.092
(Pastor Charles mumbles inaudibly)

15:27.719 --> 15:29.513
Kill the motherfucker.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.195
WINTER: <i>Everything changed</i>
<i>after Pastor Charles.</i>

15:45.279 --> 15:48.448
<i>He started popping Adderall,</i>
<i>went deeper into the Dark Web,</i>

15:48.532 --> 15:50.659
<i>but he realized</i>
<i>he can't save everyone.</i>

15:50.742 --> 15:53.787
<i>Better to burn it all down</i>
<i>and build a new world.</i>

15:53.871 --> 15:56.248
<i>I know you guys hate him</i>
<i>right now,</i>

15:56.331 --> 15:57.791
he's lost his way,

15:57.875 --> 16:00.669
but we can put him back
on the right path.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.880
I'll go to him.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.965
He'll listen to me.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.676
(softly) I know, baby.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.178
You're right.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.889
BEVERLY:
Fine.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.891
We'll try it your way.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.143
But come the end of the week,

16:16.226 --> 16:18.187
if I'm still
in this goddamn kitchen,

16:18.270 --> 16:20.397
I'm coming for your brother.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.567
And you better get
the hell out of my way.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.747
KAI: So...

16:36.830 --> 16:38.373
the girls are restless.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.209
WINTER: No. We just feel
kind of left out.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.837
I mean, Jesus, Kai, you have us
working in a kitchen.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.381
Well, I was gonna put Harrison
in the kitchen, but...

16:46.465 --> 16:47.966
somebody killed him.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.177
You're still mad about that?

16:50.260 --> 16:53.263
No. Actually, I'm not.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.645
Come here.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.522
Sit with me.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.794
(breathes deeply)

17:26.797 --> 17:28.549
Total honesty.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.885
Absolute truth.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.390
Do you love me?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.769
Will you always be loyal to me?

17:43.981 --> 17:47.317
You make it so hard sometimes.

17:47.401 --> 17:50.612
It's time for you to understand

17:50.696 --> 17:54.157
your place
in the bigger picture.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.285
I must have your vow.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.495
-Yes.
-Yes?

17:58.579 --> 18:01.206
(laughs, sobs)

18:07.087 --> 18:09.256
Kai? What's wrong?

18:09.339 --> 18:12.551
I've never seen you interrupt
a pinky-power before.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.804
(Kai sobbing)

18:18.182 --> 18:20.309
I just love you so much.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.811
Our family.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.148
-You love our family?
-Yeah.

18:26.732 --> 18:28.609
The one we're going to make.

18:29.484 --> 18:30.861
What?

18:30.944 --> 18:33.280
The work we've begun

18:33.363 --> 18:36.450
is the work of generations, Winter.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.078
We're just the seed.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.164
And from that seed,

18:42.247 --> 18:44.708
from the blood we share,

18:44.791 --> 18:47.794
a savior will arise

18:48.420 --> 18:51.089
to carry on our mission.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.095
You...

18:58.514 --> 19:02.351
...will be the mother
of our messiah baby.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.604
Kai, we can't have a baby.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.272
That's incest.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.274
No, no, no.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.904
I'm not suggesting that at all.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.907
-Samuels.
-Samuels?

19:18.075 --> 19:19.826
He's beautiful, don't you think?

19:21.787 --> 19:26.041
He will be the instrument
of our union.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.377
Our union?

19:28.460 --> 19:29.837
Yes.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.422
As he enters you,

19:32.506 --> 19:34.633
I will enter him.

19:34.716 --> 19:38.512
That way, I will be the father,

19:38.929 --> 19:41.974
but you will remain
pure and unsoiled.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.434
You cool with that?

19:44.935 --> 19:46.478
ALLY:
<i>I need you to leave.</i>

19:46.562 --> 19:48.230
Okay, if we, if we can
just sit for a second.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.731
I don't care to sit,

19:49.815 --> 19:51.900
and why are you still
in my house?

19:51.984 --> 19:53.777
-You're unhappy, I get it.
-Unhappy?

19:53.861 --> 19:55.779
Why would I be unhappy?

19:55.863 --> 19:58.699
Because you had me locked up
in a psych ward for three weeks?

19:58.782 --> 20:01.285
I told you why, Ally.
It was to keep you safe.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.995
Bullshit.

20:03.078 --> 20:06.373
Since when have you given
a damn about my safety

20:06.456 --> 20:08.083
or the safety of my family?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.793
I have been coming to you
for months,

20:09.877 --> 20:12.045
begging for your help,
telling you exactly

20:12.129 --> 20:13.714
what's been going on.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.382
Did you even listen to me?

20:15.465 --> 20:16.466
(exhales)

20:16.800 --> 20:19.595
You never believed a word
I said, did you?

20:19.678 --> 20:22.055
-Did you?
-I do now.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.474
I do now.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.310
All of it.
And the man

20:26.393 --> 20:28.437
that has been terrorizing you
is more dangerous than you know.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.898
(scoffs)
What do you know about him?

20:36.862 --> 20:38.614
He's my brother.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.743
He's my little brother.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.662
ALLY (quietly):
Wait a minute.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.539
This-this is my nanny.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.082
Wait, is Winter your sister?

20:49.166 --> 20:51.376
-Yes.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.713
Your sister is screwing my wife!

20:54.796 --> 20:57.716
I'm sorry I wasn't listening,
at least not clearly enough.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.176
It-it never occurred to me

20:59.259 --> 21:01.512
that you were talking
about my brother.

21:03.472 --> 21:04.723
Oh, my God.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.266
What?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.394
That's how he did it.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.689
That's how he got
inside my head.

21:12.773 --> 21:14.316
-It was you.
-No. No, no.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.318
-No, no. No.
-I told you everything.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.695
-About the clowns, the holes, all of it!
-Absolutely not.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.989
What was I, some kind of amusing
conversation at a family dinner?

21:21.073 --> 21:22.866
VINCENT: <i>He must've</i>
<i>broken into my office</i>

21:22.950 --> 21:24.701
<i>and accessed my case files.</i>

21:25.661 --> 21:26.912
This is all your fault.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.330
I want your license.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.790
-I want your goddamn license!
-Okay.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.208
You have ruined my life!

21:31.291 --> 21:33.168
-I need you to trust me!
-Trust you?!

21:33.252 --> 21:34.419
How the hell am I supposed
to trust you?

21:34.503 --> 21:35.712
You spent years
under the same roof,

21:35.796 --> 21:36.922
and you're just now realizing

21:37.005 --> 21:38.215
-your brother's a psychopath?
-I know.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.968
You have taken
everything from me!

21:41.218 --> 21:43.929
-You are the reason I lost my son!
-Ally. Al...

21:44.012 --> 21:45.264
-All right, I know.
-You understand that?

21:45.347 --> 21:46.640
-I know. I know.
-Goddamn you!

21:46.723 --> 21:48.392
I'm sorry. Ally...

21:48.475 --> 21:50.018
I am going to put you back
together with your son,

21:50.102 --> 21:52.271
if it is the last thing I do.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.605
I'm gonna get Kai
off the street.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.941
I'm gonna have him committed,

21:56.024 --> 21:57.901
or prosecuted,
if it comes to that.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.153
But you will have
your life back.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.864
I promise you that.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.244
This is important work
we're doing.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.913
Maybe the most important thing
we'll ever do.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.540
I guess.

22:12.165 --> 22:15.294
I can't believe I was at the
Women's March three months ago.

22:18.881 --> 22:20.591
KAI:
My children.

22:23.468 --> 22:26.346
The time of anointing
is at hand.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.020
<i>I swear</i>

22:33.103 --> 22:36.523
<i>By the moon and the stars...</i>

22:36.607 --> 22:37.983
What the fuck is this?

22:38.066 --> 22:39.776
Language, sister.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.486
This is a holy space now.

22:41.570 --> 22:44.698
And this is a holy song now...

22:44.781 --> 22:46.700
<i>Like the shadow that's by your side...</i>

22:46.783 --> 22:48.702
...like the Lord's Prayer.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.705
From this day forward,

22:51.788 --> 22:55.000
it shall be played whenever
a messiah is conceived.

22:55.626 --> 22:58.086
Isn't the whole point of a
messiah that there's only one?

22:58.170 --> 22:59.838
KAI:
Shh.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.298
<i>I know what's weighing...</i>

23:01.381 --> 23:03.300
Let us remove our garments.

23:03.383 --> 23:07.221
They will be burned once the
sacred copulation is complete.

23:07.304 --> 23:11.683
<i>I know my part</i>

23:11.767 --> 23:16.522
<i>'Cause I'll stand beside you</i>

23:16.605 --> 23:19.399
<i>Through the years</i>

23:19.483 --> 23:22.361
<i>You'll only cry</i>
<i>those happy tears...</i>

23:22.444 --> 23:24.321
(inhaling)

23:24.404 --> 23:25.531
Mmm.

23:25.614 --> 23:29.910
<i>And though I make mistakes</i>

23:29.993 --> 23:33.163
<i>I'll never break</i>
<i>your heart...</i>

23:33.247 --> 23:35.332
You may lay down
your receptacle now.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.376
<i>I swear</i>

23:37.459 --> 23:42.214
<i>By the moon and the stars</i>
<i>and the sky</i>

23:42.297 --> 23:43.674
(exhales)

23:43.757 --> 23:46.051
<i>I'll be there</i>

23:46.134 --> 23:48.595
<i>And I swear</i>

23:48.679 --> 23:49.930
<i>Like the shadow</i>

23:50.013 --> 23:52.599
<i>That's by your side</i>

23:55.185 --> 23:56.854
(Samuels moaning)

23:57.938 --> 24:00.816
<i>For better or worse</i>

24:00.899 --> 24:04.111
<i>Till death do us part...</i>

24:05.112 --> 24:06.822
KAI:
Mount her.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.699
<i>Every beat of my heart</i>

24:08.782 --> 24:11.493
<i>-And I swear</i>
<i>-And I swear</i>

24:14.830 --> 24:16.790
<i>Whoa, oh...</i>

24:17.708 --> 24:19.793
(Samuels panting, grunting)

24:19.877 --> 24:21.962
Oh, shit. I-I can't get it hard.

24:22.546 --> 24:24.882
The leader must be
the last to penetrate.

24:24.965 --> 24:27.384
I must enter you both
when you are joined as one.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.761
I can't get it up with girls
anymore. You know that.

24:29.845 --> 24:31.180
You proved it to me yourself.

24:31.263 --> 24:33.307
KAI: (sighs)
This isn't sex.

24:33.390 --> 24:36.268
This is a spiritual journey.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.270
Maybe the pressure of creating
the messiah baby

24:38.353 --> 24:39.980
is causing your impotence.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.690
-(grunts)
-Get the fuck off.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.150
No. Get back on the bed!

24:43.233 --> 24:46.278
This is too screwed up,
even for you.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.071
I feel like I'm being raped.

24:48.614 --> 24:50.407
Maybe I can-I can cum in a cup,

24:50.490 --> 24:52.034
and we can turkey baster it
into her, or something.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.077
No! It must be done like this.

24:54.161 --> 24:55.996
This is the holy ritual!

24:56.079 --> 24:58.415
That you came up with
this afternoon.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.917
It's all bullshit.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.544
KAI:
No one

25:02.628 --> 25:04.087
<i>is above the law.</i>

25:46.797 --> 25:49.091
(knocking on door)

25:51.927 --> 25:54.596
(utensil clatters)

26:04.064 --> 26:06.608
Hello, Councilman.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.819
Come on in.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.405
Dinner's almost ready.

26:11.488 --> 26:14.366
Leftist salads with quinoa
and green goddess dressing?

26:18.245 --> 26:19.830
I'm making sloppy joes.

26:19.913 --> 26:22.082
'Cause a sandwich is a sandwich,

26:22.165 --> 26:24.209
but a Manwich is a meal.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.295
"Manwich."

26:26.837 --> 26:28.088
Appropriate.

26:28.172 --> 26:29.464
I thought so.

26:30.174 --> 26:32.134
Last I heard,
you were in a psych ward.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.927
Last I heard,
you were an asshole.

26:34.428 --> 26:36.722
These men pledged loyalty to me,
and they're armed.

26:36.805 --> 26:39.099
If you asked me here to take me out,
you're not gonna get far.

26:39.183 --> 26:41.226
I didn't ask you over here
to kill you,

26:41.310 --> 26:43.478
but to offer you something.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.064
Information.

26:46.148 --> 26:47.608
How about you keep your hands
where I can see them,

26:47.691 --> 26:49.067
just in case?

26:49.151 --> 26:50.360
And Speedwagon here

26:50.444 --> 26:51.987
is gonna taste my food
before I eat it.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.655
Well, that's fine.

26:55.574 --> 26:57.743
But do you think
they could give us a minute,

26:57.826 --> 26:59.828
so we could speak privately?

27:01.079 --> 27:02.456
Oh, come on.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.375
You're not scared to be alone
with me, are you?

27:09.379 --> 27:11.798
(door opens)

27:18.138 --> 27:21.141
I know something that
you are going to want to hear.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.770
But I'm not giving it to you
for free.

27:24.853 --> 27:27.773
You have something that I want.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.318
Your wife?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.654
I want my son.

27:34.238 --> 27:36.073
I miss my son.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.784
I am his mother,
and I want him back with me.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.494
What's in it for me?

27:40.577 --> 27:42.538
Do you promise,
after I tell you,

27:42.621 --> 27:44.623
that you will give me
what I want?

27:45.457 --> 27:48.585
You act as if I have any control
over the affairs of your family.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.879
I'm just a city councilman,
trying to make a difference.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.132
I am going to need your word.

27:59.263 --> 28:02.099
Your brother's trying
to get you committed.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.894
He told me himself.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.729
Committed for what?

28:08.146 --> 28:10.691
Like I said, I'm just
a simple city councilman,

28:10.774 --> 28:12.526
-trying to save this community.
-Yeah,

28:12.609 --> 28:16.029
you and I and Vincent know
that that isn't true.

28:17.531 --> 28:19.950
So if, for some reason,
your plan to take over the world

28:20.033 --> 28:22.953
doesn't work out,
your stink will be all over him.

28:23.036 --> 28:25.789
Unless he can prove
that he tried to stop you.

28:25.873 --> 28:27.082
Bullshit.

28:27.833 --> 28:29.626
I know you're not stupid.

28:31.378 --> 28:34.548
Do you think
that all this shit you're doing

28:34.631 --> 28:36.967
isn't causing him any trouble?

28:37.342 --> 28:40.345
There's something different
about you.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.183
Did you get a new haircut
or something?

28:51.064 --> 28:53.817
After months
of you terrorizing me,

28:54.776 --> 28:57.696
forcing me to face my phobias,

28:57.779 --> 29:01.325
you did the one thing
that my wife,

29:01.408 --> 29:03.410
or your brother,

29:03.493 --> 29:06.580
or all the meds in the world,
couldn't do.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.336
You cured me.

29:12.419 --> 29:15.255
I'm not afraid
of anything anymore.

29:24.681 --> 29:27.267
You don't need Aerosmith to...

29:27.351 --> 29:29.770
check it for poison?

29:29.853 --> 29:31.271
Nope.

29:31.355 --> 29:34.525
I want every delicious bite
all to myself.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.033
(sighs)

30:26.535 --> 30:29.872
(sighs)
Thank God for air conditioning.

30:29.955 --> 30:32.082
This stupid dunce cap makes my head,
like, 20 degrees hotter.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.334
That's your penance.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.420
And here's your lunch, servant.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.255
Oh, there's another bag
of recyclables in the trunk

30:38.338 --> 30:40.007
-when you're done.
-What the fuck?

30:40.090 --> 30:42.509
Kai wants you to put the garbage
back where it belongs,

30:42.593 --> 30:44.469
because he doesn't believe
in global warming.

30:44.553 --> 30:46.388
I meant why are you calling me "servant"?

30:46.471 --> 30:48.515
I'm just following orders.

30:50.184 --> 30:51.518
(scoffs)
This is gruel.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.353
This is what I had last night.

30:54.771 --> 30:56.690
-Can I have that?
-No.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.442
Kai isn't going to know.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.694
You're not a puppet--
he doesn't control you.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.863
Jesus.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.156
Were you always his bitch?

31:04.239 --> 31:06.241
When I first met him,
he was mine.

31:06.909 --> 31:08.827
KAI:
Don't go to the same pharmacy.

31:08.911 --> 31:09.995
There's no refills.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.163
You need more,

31:11.246 --> 31:12.247
come to me.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.292
(groans)

31:15.375 --> 31:16.835
Fuck. (groans)

31:16.919 --> 31:19.755
-(pants)
-Dr. Vincent Anderson, huh?

31:21.006 --> 31:23.759
Let me see your medical license, Doctor.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.844
(grunting)

31:27.596 --> 31:29.389
Prescription fraud's a felony.

31:29.473 --> 31:31.683
Four years in prison,
$30,000 fine.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.685
I could take you in right now.

31:33.769 --> 31:35.354
Or...

31:35.437 --> 31:36.939
I could be your partner.

31:37.606 --> 31:39.107
Fifty-fifty?

31:39.483 --> 31:40.776
Suck my cock.

31:40.859 --> 31:43.612
70-30 and I want the money
at my house every week.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.822
WINTER:
<i>You blackmailed my brother.</i>

31:45.906 --> 31:47.324
<i>You're not a cop--</i>
<i>you're a criminal.</i>

31:47.407 --> 31:49.326
SAMUELS:
<i>I didn't know what I was.</i>

31:49.409 --> 31:51.828
("Pleasure Through Pain"
by Excessum playing)

31:59.086 --> 32:01.088
-(Samuels panting)
-(woman moaning)

32:07.594 --> 32:09.805
(woman moaning)

32:12.307 --> 32:14.142
WOMAN:
Why is it soft?

32:15.435 --> 32:17.437
(moans)

32:20.482 --> 32:24.236
(both grunting, moaning)

32:24.319 --> 32:25.654
(loud moaning)

32:25.737 --> 32:27.614
-(woman grunts loudly)
-(crashing)

32:28.824 --> 32:31.660
(sobbing) There's something
fucking wrong with you, asshole!

32:31.869 --> 32:33.120
Miss, you okay?

32:33.203 --> 32:35.205
No! I'm not okay!

32:35.289 --> 32:37.207
That limp dick in there
can't get it up

32:37.291 --> 32:38.876
unless he puts his hands
around my neck!

32:39.168 --> 32:41.503
(door slams)

32:41.587 --> 32:44.756
<i>Filled with my lust</i>

32:44.840 --> 32:47.467
<i>And my hate</i>

32:47.551 --> 32:51.430
<i>I suffocate</i>

32:51.513 --> 32:54.183
<i>So I will...</i>

32:54.266 --> 32:56.602
(music stops)

32:56.727 --> 32:58.270
(Samuels panting)

33:18.165 --> 33:20.459
I can get any girl I want,
you know?

33:21.335 --> 33:24.171
I've got the looks,
I've-I've got the badge.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.758
They feel safe with me.

33:29.259 --> 33:31.386
They feel like
I can protect them.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.138
I just haven't found
the right one yet.

33:33.222 --> 33:34.598
That's because you hate women.

33:34.681 --> 33:36.892
Oh, you eat shit and die.

33:36.975 --> 33:38.769
I go through three,
sometimes four in one night.

33:42.189 --> 33:43.732
They make you weak.

33:46.235 --> 33:48.320
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

33:50.739 --> 33:52.824
Every time you have sex...

33:54.076 --> 33:55.619
they take your power.

33:56.203 --> 33:59.581
Deep down you know that,
and you're trying to stop them.

34:05.003 --> 34:08.215
But you can't get power
by giving it away.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.553
You have to take it yourself.

34:14.471 --> 34:16.056
Yeah, I...

34:16.139 --> 34:19.142
I get that, but... how?

34:21.478 --> 34:23.438
You don't need more women.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.360
You need a man.

34:29.653 --> 34:31.363
No, I'm not gay.

34:31.446 --> 34:34.741
There's no such thing
as gay or straight.

34:34.825 --> 34:37.744
You have to lean
into your masculinity.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.164
It's...

34:41.957 --> 34:44.001
it's like electricity.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.629
The positive and negative,
the flow.

34:48.755 --> 34:50.382
When the circuit is complete,

34:50.465 --> 34:52.759
the power flows.

34:53.427 --> 34:56.305
You become stronger, plugged in.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.141
With a man...

35:00.142 --> 35:01.935
there's no energy drain.

35:03.687 --> 35:07.357
You're building on one another,
exponentially.

35:09.401 --> 35:12.571
<i>You've been giving it up</i>
<i>your whole life.</i>

35:12.654 --> 35:14.781
<i>It's time you get some back.</i>

35:16.241 --> 35:17.326
SAMUELS:
<i>Kai was right.</i>

35:17.409 --> 35:19.286
That's why I follow his rules.

35:19.369 --> 35:22.331
(laughs)
Dude, you're totally gay.

35:22.539 --> 35:24.124
You're wrong.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.043
You're missing
the goddamn point.

35:26.126 --> 35:27.336
It's much more complex
than that.

35:27.836 --> 35:30.756
It's as simple as you like dick!

35:30.839 --> 35:32.299
Fuck!

35:33.342 --> 35:34.760
(panting)

35:36.553 --> 35:37.554
What are you doing?

35:37.638 --> 35:39.223
I'm gonna impregnate you,
like Kai wanted.

35:39.306 --> 35:41.642
I'm not gonna have sex with you.
You can't even get it up.

35:42.017 --> 35:43.852
Oh, I know how to get it hard.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.062
What the...

35:45.729 --> 35:47.981
Fuckin' piece of shit!

35:48.065 --> 35:50.108
(screaming)

35:50.859 --> 35:52.444
Aah, aah!

35:53.487 --> 35:55.405
You son of a bitch!

35:55.489 --> 35:56.990
Valerie was right!

35:57.074 --> 35:58.867
You're like every man.

35:58.951 --> 36:00.786
-You're a turd.
-Be careful with that.

36:00.869 --> 36:02.371
Say it!

36:02.454 --> 36:04.248
-"I'm a turd."
-No.

36:04.331 --> 36:07.501
"I'm a lowly, abject turd!"

36:07.584 --> 36:09.294
Fuck you!

36:10.128 --> 36:12.714
When Hillary lost, I did, too.

36:13.382 --> 36:15.133
I should have fought back.

36:15.217 --> 36:17.219
I should have gotten angry.

36:17.302 --> 36:19.596
I joined this thing
and it's too late for me.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.307
And it's too late for you, too, turd.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.976
(screaming)

36:30.065 --> 36:32.067
MEN (chanting): Divine ruler.
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

36:32.150 --> 36:34.736
KAI: Bring the betrayers to me.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.656
MEN (continuing):
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

36:37.739 --> 36:41.076
Divine ruler.
Divine ruler.

36:41.159 --> 36:43.287
Divine ruler.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.706
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

36:45.789 --> 36:48.292
Divine ruler.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.919
Divine ruler. Divine ruler.

36:58.635 --> 37:00.637
(panting)

37:25.954 --> 37:27.915
Flesh and blood first.

37:29.124 --> 37:30.876
Kai, what are you doing?

37:30.959 --> 37:32.628
Untie me. Let me go.

37:34.254 --> 37:35.631
Let me go.

37:37.466 --> 37:39.760
You were supposed to protect me.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.971
You were supposed to help me.

37:43.055 --> 37:44.765
I'm trying to help you.

37:44.848 --> 37:46.433
You know you can
always trust me, Kai.

37:50.646 --> 37:54.316
I know what you've been up to.

37:56.318 --> 37:59.238
You were trying to lock me up
in the loony bin, traitor.

37:59.530 --> 38:01.031
Please, I was just concerned.
You...

38:01.114 --> 38:02.574
We can talk about this.

38:02.658 --> 38:04.660
It's not too late.

38:07.704 --> 38:10.457
Look at what you're doing.
This is not a healthy path.

38:10.541 --> 38:12.251
I've been chosen, Vince!

38:12.584 --> 38:15.254
People are counting on me
to lead!

38:15.337 --> 38:17.965
To light up this cesspool
and usher in a new beginning!

38:18.048 --> 38:19.216
VINCENT:
Kai, listen to me.

38:19.299 --> 38:22.386
All I want is
to see you succeed.

38:23.053 --> 38:26.431
No matter what happens, you are
my brother and I love you.

38:28.392 --> 38:29.935
I love you.

38:31.395 --> 38:33.981
Do you remember when you taught
me about pinky-power?

38:35.607 --> 38:39.486
Yes. It was our
own private world.

38:39.570 --> 38:41.572
And when we were
locked together...

38:42.656 --> 38:44.783
didn't matter what we did.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.120
All would be forgiven
if you just told the truth.

38:48.203 --> 38:50.330
That's right.

38:57.713 --> 39:00.340
(Kai exhales)

39:17.858 --> 39:20.903
We never lied to each other.

39:20.986 --> 39:23.071
Never.

39:26.283 --> 39:28.160
That's what made it so special.

39:28.452 --> 39:29.786
Yeah.

39:29.870 --> 39:32.122
(Vincent screams)

39:37.127 --> 39:38.504
Winter?

39:38.587 --> 39:39.713
Vincent.

39:42.174 --> 39:43.926
Aah!

39:44.009 --> 39:45.010
(gasps)

39:48.472 --> 39:49.473
(gurgles)

39:51.433 --> 39:53.227
(coughing)

39:57.564 --> 39:59.608
Get him out of my sight.

40:08.784 --> 40:11.036
What the fuck is going on?

40:11.119 --> 40:12.246
KAI: Beverly Hope.

40:12.329 --> 40:15.332
I had such plans for you...

40:16.792 --> 40:18.627
and you pissed it all away.

40:20.504 --> 40:21.839
Why?

40:21.922 --> 40:23.882
What are you talking about?
What did I do?

40:23.966 --> 40:25.509
You know what you did.

40:25.592 --> 40:28.512
Samuels deserved a lot better
than a cheap bullet to the head.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.181
Winter told me everything.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.352
SAMUELS:
<i>You've been working hard.</i>

40:35.435 --> 40:37.312
I'm sure one apple
wouldn't hurt.

40:37.396 --> 40:38.730
No. This is my punishment.

40:38.814 --> 40:40.440
I intend to honor it.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.693
SAMUELS:
No!

40:45.821 --> 40:47.781
Tell your brother he's next.

40:50.993 --> 40:52.494
Pack of lies.

40:52.953 --> 40:54.496
Bitch is full of shit.

40:58.208 --> 41:00.210
I chose you, Beverly!

41:01.128 --> 41:03.922
I trusted you!
I made you my equal!

41:04.006 --> 41:05.507
Why did you betray me?!

41:05.591 --> 41:08.177
You betrayed me!

41:09.344 --> 41:11.847
One day you promise me
equal partnership,

41:11.930 --> 41:15.934
the next you have me in a gulag
baking fucking cookies!

41:16.101 --> 41:19.104
Your promises mean shit!

41:21.190 --> 41:22.900
You're a fake.

41:22.983 --> 41:24.943
You don't stand
for a goddamn thing.

41:25.027 --> 41:26.486
I'm standing up
for millions of people

41:26.570 --> 41:28.197
who are finally being heard!

41:28.363 --> 41:31.283
Everything I do is in service
to the greater purpose!

41:31.366 --> 41:34.828
It's bigger than anything in our lives
and you are fucking it up!

41:34.912 --> 41:36.830
Nothing is bigger than your ego.

41:36.914 --> 41:38.624
You don't know
what the fuck you're doing

41:38.707 --> 41:40.375
from one minute to the next.

41:40.459 --> 41:42.294
You're incompetent, Kai.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.671
Just another attention whore.

41:44.755 --> 41:47.299
And if you're insecure enough
to believe Winter, well, then,

41:47.382 --> 41:49.176
just kill me now.

41:49.259 --> 41:50.511
Put me out of my misery.

41:50.594 --> 41:52.971
Because the biggest mistake
I ever made

41:53.055 --> 41:55.807
was believing in you. Turd.

41:56.767 --> 41:58.936
You were my favorite.

42:01.271 --> 42:03.106
But death is too good for you.

42:03.649 --> 42:05.400
I want you to suffer.

42:05.484 --> 42:07.402
Take her to the isolation chamber.

42:07.486 --> 42:10.531
Rot in hell, you son of a bitch.

42:19.498 --> 42:20.916
Loyalty...

42:23.085 --> 42:24.795
must be absolute.

42:25.295 --> 42:27.631
Without it, we have nothing.

42:29.550 --> 42:32.511
Now we can move forward.

42:52.698 --> 42:56.243
