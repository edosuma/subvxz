WEBVTT

00:04.783 --> 00:07.989
We were excited about our
first Halloween in Chatswin...

00:08.169 --> 00:10.536
Maybe more excited than
we should've been.

00:11.065 --> 00:13.146
Hi, neighbor!

00:13.475 --> 00:15.835
That's my tombstone?
What killed me?

00:17.318 --> 00:19.629
It started as a lump
under your arm.

00:20.634 --> 00:23.488
I urged you to get it
look at, but you...

00:23.988 --> 00:25.408
You said it was nothin'.

00:25.768 --> 00:27.171
And then four weeks later...

00:27.225 --> 00:28.759
Four weeks later?

00:29.910 --> 00:31.164
I told you to get it looked at.

00:31.194 --> 00:32.992
Okay, thank you. That's enough.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.302
You're good at Halloween.

00:34.509 --> 00:35.352
I was.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.577
But growing up in the city, I
never had a chance to shine.

00:38.764 --> 00:41.119
Our halloweens were scary
in a different way.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.587
Trick or treat?!

00:42.588 --> 00:44.492
Yeah.
There's been a murder here.

00:45.029 --> 00:46.034
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

00:46.073 --> 00:48.375
- Murder?
- Wow, you guys went all out, huh?

00:49.460 --> 00:53.024
So the idea of a Halloween drenched
in fake blood instead of real blood

00:53.655 --> 00:54.812
was pretty appealing.

00:54.851 --> 00:55.736
Oh.

00:53.092 --> 00:53.542
Oh.

00:56.169 --> 00:58.490
We need realistic
arterial spray,

00:58.519 --> 00:59.585
not amateur hour.

00:59.739 --> 01:01.935
Amateur hour?
I should cut your head off for that.

01:02.076 --> 01:04.191
- You're all talk.
- All talk, huh?

01:04.275 --> 01:05.309
Here we go!

01:05.480 --> 01:06.346
No! No!

01:06.414 --> 01:07.314
Ugh!

01:08.477 --> 01:10.249
Any final words?

01:10.331 --> 01:13.156
- Yes!
- I'm not afraid to die.

01:13.185 --> 01:15.185
I've lived in Chatswin.

01:15.224 --> 01:16.170
Hey, buddy!

01:16.254 --> 01:17.500
What's going on?

01:17.524 --> 01:18.620
Oh, nothing.

01:18.852 --> 01:21.296
Was gonna cut Tessa's head
off with my new guillotine,

01:21.371 --> 01:23.517
but I really have no
follow-through so...

01:23.529 --> 01:24.893
Terrific! Gory stuff! Yikes!

01:24.915 --> 01:27.142
Have you cleared any of this with
the neighborhood association?

01:27.175 --> 01:28.817
What?
You have to clear decorations?

01:28.863 --> 01:29.695
It's Halloween.

01:29.729 --> 01:31.192
Yeah but the
neighborhood association

01:31.218 --> 01:34.081
has to approve any changes
to the town aesthetic.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.796
I... it can be a total drag.

01:35.825 --> 01:38.100
It's like, "ugh!
Quit coming down on me"

01:38.139 --> 01:40.524
with your rules, "the
neighborhood association."

01:40.551 --> 01:41.980
But, uh, then again,

01:42.142 --> 01:45.636
Chatswin always wins the award
for most uniform houses.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.627
- That's not nothing.
- It's next to nothing.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.551
I'm putting up my decorations.
What are they gonna do, fine me?

01:49.574 --> 01:51.457
- Yes, they're going to fine you.
- Fine me. Fine.

01:51.519 --> 01:54.176
Don't pretend like you
have disposable income.

01:54.199 --> 01:57.328
Let me, uh, help you, uh,
put this in the garage.

01:57.342 --> 01:59.662
You can talk to Dallas.
She's the head of the N.A.

01:59.793 --> 02:01.370
Maybe she'll bend
the rules for you.

02:01.434 --> 02:03.109
I knew Halloween out
here was gonna suck.

02:03.156 --> 02:04.613
Hey, over my dead body.

02:04.703 --> 02:06.060
What killed you, by the way?

02:06.354 --> 02:08.509
It started as a dry,
persistent, cough...

02:08.939 --> 02:12.322
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:20.964 --> 02:22.135
If these suburban idiots

02:22.136 --> 02:24.086
wanted to make a
mockery of Halloween,

02:24.287 --> 02:25.620
then I'd have to find a costume

02:25.687 --> 02:27.797
that made a mockery of them.

02:34.604 --> 02:35.609
"Misty"?

02:35.668 --> 02:36.901
Inspiration?

02:37.305 --> 02:39.056
Courtesy of "Misty"...

02:41.160 --> 02:43.310
And her nasty old hair bumpit.

02:48.455 --> 02:51.233
I decided to go as a
tacky-ass suburban girl,

02:51.261 --> 02:53.808
so naturally, I bumped it.

02:53.842 --> 02:55.206
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

02:55.635 --> 02:57.547
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

02:59.794 --> 03:01.956
Couldn't help but notice
you bumped it today.

03:02.195 --> 03:03.429
So what, skank?

03:03.779 --> 03:05.274
It's part of my costume.

03:06.546 --> 03:07.954
I found it in my room.

03:08.793 --> 03:10.520
- It used to belong to...
- Misty.

03:10.733 --> 03:13.268
- Yes. How did you...
- Know?

03:13.982 --> 03:15.517
Not as impressive, but yes.

03:16.202 --> 03:17.131
Who's this Misty chick?

03:17.173 --> 03:18.339
Misty used to live in your house,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.490
she used to bump it, she
used to wear velour

03:20.498 --> 03:22.053
sweat suits with high heels.

03:22.575 --> 03:23.593
Why won't this locker open?

03:23.650 --> 03:25.352
Because that's
Misty's old locker.

03:27.210 --> 03:27.882
Weird.

03:27.905 --> 03:29.243
Yeah, it is weird.

03:29.268 --> 03:30.016
Very weird,

03:30.045 --> 03:32.357
especially considering
what happened to Misty.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.635
What happened to Misty?

03:36.354 --> 03:37.393
Nothing.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.841
Tessa, I love a good laugh
as much as the next guy.

03:42.919 --> 03:44.679
"Kick me" signs, prank calls.

03:44.887 --> 03:47.696
But this is in bad taste.

03:47.909 --> 03:48.691
This is?

03:48.751 --> 03:50.348
I'd like to see
you in my office.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.579
Mr. wolfe used to see
Misty in his office.

04:02.278 --> 04:03.712
Oh! Hey, George.

04:03.756 --> 04:06.103
Did stop by to help string
up some smiley faces

04:06.130 --> 04:09.625
for our annual jaunty not
haunty carefest not scarefest?

04:09.637 --> 04:12.788
No. I wanna know how I am
supposed to enjoy Halloween

04:12.816 --> 04:14.261
if I can't put up a normal,

04:14.262 --> 04:16.195
run-of-the-mill
guillotine on my lawn.

04:16.305 --> 04:18.338
A guillotine?
Oh, my goodness, no.

04:18.357 --> 04:21.387
Well, that kind of scary far
exceeds our acceptable limit.

04:21.447 --> 04:23.184
I mean, it's fine
for east Chatswin,

04:23.213 --> 04:24.881
where they have
self-service gasoline

04:24.894 --> 04:26.635
and only one yogurt shop.

04:27.218 --> 04:29.635
- Now that's scary.
- But it's Halloween.

04:29.710 --> 04:31.114
And this place looks like

04:31.115 --> 04:34.081
the gumdrop fairy threw up
all over lollipop town.

04:34.145 --> 04:37.308
Yeah, he must've eaten too
many gumdrops.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.366
Whatever this is,
it's not Halloween.

04:41.190 --> 04:42.141
George...

04:42.566 --> 04:43.359
Honey?

04:44.088 --> 04:45.127
Uh, you know, George,

04:45.195 --> 04:46.593
the parents in Chatswin

04:46.594 --> 04:49.297
have gone to considerable
financial lengths

04:49.298 --> 04:52.185
to create a community to
protect our children.

04:52.318 --> 04:54.744
So why on God's green
would we go around

04:54.745 --> 04:56.934
and scare the bejoozies
out of them?

04:56.979 --> 04:58.017
But you're not protecting them.

04:58.147 --> 04:58.784
You're... you're...

04:58.785 --> 05:00.166
You're warping them.

05:00.257 --> 05:01.255
You know what scares me?

05:01.319 --> 05:03.956
Is a 15-year-old girl dressed as a...
I'm sorry, what are you?

05:04.015 --> 05:05.967
- A slutty mushroom.
- Of course you are.

05:06.011 --> 05:07.489
Looking good, shiitake!

05:07.513 --> 05:09.496
Where are the zombies?
And the witches

05:09.526 --> 05:11.605
and the...
The mutant zombie witches?

05:11.806 --> 05:14.677
You are robbing these kids
of harmless, spooky fun.

05:14.808 --> 05:18.176
Fun? No one likes to
be frightened, George.

05:18.439 --> 05:20.993
It just makes people
cry and scream

05:21.217 --> 05:22.556
and pee my pants.

05:22.860 --> 05:23.831
Wow.

05:24.039 --> 05:25.860
- You are really sensitive.
- I am.

05:25.861 --> 05:28.714
I have always been this way.
And the tiniest little thing

05:28.727 --> 05:30.045
can set me off.

05:30.395 --> 05:33.062
Bats, mice, twins,

05:33.354 --> 05:34.677
triangle eyes.

05:35.353 --> 05:36.457
Like on a pumpkin.

05:36.552 --> 05:37.703
I feel bad for you, Dallas.

05:37.768 --> 05:39.261
You have no idea
what you're missing.

05:39.287 --> 05:40.600
Ignorance is bliss.

05:40.835 --> 05:41.835
Beg pardon?

05:41.903 --> 05:44.302
Oh, no one's talking to you, bliss.
Just making a point.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.069
She is ignorant.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.031
I expect more from you, Tessa.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.456
Impersonating a former Chatswin
high student is inappropriate,

05:51.843 --> 05:54.181
especially considering
Misty's fate.

05:54.553 --> 05:56.628
Her fate? What happened?

05:56.688 --> 05:58.345
She's dead, Tessa.

05:58.432 --> 05:59.731
Misty went to...

05:59.861 --> 06:00.717
A better place.

06:02.506 --> 06:04.733
So I'm living in a
dead girl's room.

06:04.808 --> 06:06.308
That's right, Tessa.

06:06.717 --> 06:08.613
Not so funny now, is it?

06:12.544 --> 06:13.433
Lisa,

06:13.589 --> 06:15.811
why didn't you tell me I was
living in a dead girl's room?

06:18.632 --> 06:20.637
I can't go if I know that
you're standing there.

06:20.911 --> 06:22.043
I'm not leaving.

06:24.201 --> 06:25.038
Okay.

06:26.501 --> 06:29.141
Misty was new to
Chatswin, just like you.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.167
We were in homeroom together.

06:30.204 --> 06:32.137
We both liked chunky sweaters.

06:32.463 --> 06:33.770
She was my best friend.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.596
You're my best friend.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.985
But then, Misty got
lasik eye surgery.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.009
And after that,

06:40.049 --> 06:41.249
everything changed...

06:43.570 --> 06:46.898
Like she totally had lost
sight of who she was,

06:47.226 --> 06:50.572
and I really need you to
leave now so I can pee.

06:50.939 --> 06:53.235
Uh-oh. I'm turning on the water.

06:53.516 --> 06:54.970
It sounds
like a stream of...

06:54.984 --> 06:56.742
Okay! Okay. All right.

06:57.379 --> 06:59.825
I was hurt and angry,

07:00.381 --> 07:03.699
and I just wanted Misty
to disappear forever.

07:04.961 --> 07:07.168
And then, one day, she did.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.009
(Toilet flushes,

07:14.071 --> 07:14.843
stall door opens)

07:16.535 --> 07:18.181
I thought you couldn't go
if I was standing here.

07:18.249 --> 07:19.416
I went during the flush.

07:19.437 --> 07:20.662
So then what happened to Misty?

07:21.782 --> 07:22.524
How'd she die?

07:26.294 --> 07:27.294
But I'm worried.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.940
Why?
Because I'm dressing like her?

07:28.989 --> 07:32.471
No, because you bumped it and
you're using her old locker

07:32.493 --> 07:35.132
and you're throwing around lots
of 'tude like Misty and...

07:35.185 --> 07:36.553
Lisa, this is redonk.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.132
And you just said "redonk"!

07:39.113 --> 07:40.840
That's what Misty always used
to say about everything!

07:40.855 --> 07:41.775
What are you trying
to say, Lisa?

07:41.798 --> 07:43.010
I am trying to say

07:43.080 --> 07:44.681
that is it near all hallows Eve,

07:45.445 --> 07:48.334
and that the spirit of Misty
is trying to possess you.

07:50.639 --> 07:51.826
Ohh!

07:52.103 --> 07:53.203
I get it.

07:54.232 --> 07:55.777
You're supposed to be a lunatic.

07:56.078 --> 07:57.597
I'm a ladybug.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
George?

07:59.954 --> 08:01.054
Come in!

08:01.521 --> 08:02.379
George?

08:02.386 --> 08:04.376
Yeah, come on back.
I'm in the living room.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.769
Hey, I got your message, and
I don't want to be rude,

08:06.798 --> 08:10.410
but I think any more talk
of this guillotine of yours

08:10.564 --> 08:11.835
is a huge waste of time.

08:11.937 --> 08:14.364
- Hey. Come on in. Sit down.
- Oh. I don't have time.

08:14.396 --> 08:15.230
Steven's out of town,

08:15.231 --> 08:17.466
and I need to have the housekeeper
order dinner for dahlia.

08:17.492 --> 08:18.367
Come over here for a sec.

08:18.368 --> 08:20.468
I got a picture of a lollipop.
You gotta check this out.

08:20.879 --> 08:22.351
What kind of lollipop?

08:22.422 --> 08:23.759
Aah!

08:23.978 --> 08:24.744
Ah!

08:25.718 --> 08:26.886
Ow! Oh. Dallas?

08:26.937 --> 08:28.899
- Ohh.
- Are you okay?

08:29.193 --> 08:30.765
- That was not okay.
- I'm sorry.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.332
Why would you do this?

08:32.442 --> 08:33.775
What is wrong with you?

08:33.907 --> 08:35.841
I'm sorry. I thought I'd
throw you in the deep end,

08:35.876 --> 08:37.467
show you how much fun
being scared can be.

08:37.503 --> 08:38.981
Does it look like
I'm having fun?!

08:39.028 --> 08:39.953
Sorry. You rest here.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.078
I'm gonna get ya some ice.

08:41.110 --> 08:42.764
Who let all these bees in here?

08:43.707 --> 08:44.317
O-okay.

08:44.374 --> 08:46.265
Rest, but don't fall asleep.

08:46.825 --> 08:48.292
I don't
believe in ghosts.

08:48.374 --> 08:49.874
I'm not superstitious.

08:49.909 --> 08:51.946
My first kiss was
under a ladder.

08:52.685 --> 08:53.757
But to be honest,

08:53.758 --> 08:56.014
the whole idea of sleeping
in a dead girl's room

08:56.030 --> 08:58.046
was starting to freak me out.

09:02.817 --> 09:03.740
Dad?

09:05.595 --> 09:06.360
You're still awake.

09:08.016 --> 09:08.696
Yeah.

09:09.390 --> 09:10.594
What are you doing up?

09:10.727 --> 09:11.894
Ahh.

09:11.955 --> 09:13.298
Couldn't sleep.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.704
So listen, I don't want
to disappoint you, but...

09:19.491 --> 09:21.675
Halloween out here
is gonna suck.

09:23.072 --> 09:24.396
So no luck with Dallas, huh?

09:24.600 --> 09:25.607
Not really.

09:26.903 --> 09:28.998
And I almost killed her trying.

09:29.868 --> 09:30.751
Dad...

09:31.915 --> 09:33.677
Do you ever wonder who
lived here before us?

09:33.784 --> 09:36.373
Yeah. What kind of lunatics
would buy squishy toilet seats?

09:36.387 --> 09:37.386
I mean...

09:37.680 --> 09:38.713
If someone...

09:39.024 --> 09:42.234
Died in this house, they would have to
tell you before we moved in here, right?

09:43.769 --> 09:44.691
It depends.

09:45.877 --> 09:46.631
On what?

09:46.917 --> 09:47.667
If they were...

09:49.704 --> 09:50.406
Murdered.

09:56.753 --> 09:58.381
- So you didn't hear anything?
- No.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.356
Nothing.

10:00.877 --> 10:02.295
Good
night, sweetheart.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.074

10:11.010 --> 10:12.538
Like a doctor in the E.R.,

10:12.593 --> 10:14.608
George refused to let it die.

10:14.898 --> 10:15.953
He made one final attempt

10:15.954 --> 10:18.232
to convince Dallas we should
have a scary Halloween.

10:18.853 --> 10:20.291
Come on, Dallas. Where are you?

10:20.360 --> 10:21.546
Aah! Holy crap!

10:22.120 --> 10:24.560
Whoa. Oh, my lordy, George.
Did I scare you?

10:24.593 --> 10:26.561
No! I-I mean, no. You just...

10:26.876 --> 10:27.869
Caught me by surprise.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.656
I did scare you, didn't I?

10:29.677 --> 10:30.757
Okay, maybe a little, yeah.

10:31.978 --> 10:33.661
You should have seen your face.

10:33.729 --> 10:36.034
I thought your eyebrows were
gonna pop off your head.

10:36.118 --> 10:37.958
Well, you...
You just came out of nowhere.

10:37.973 --> 10:39.900
Pop, pop.
That's what it looked like.

10:41.014 --> 10:43.000
- This is fun.
- See?

10:43.028 --> 10:45.911
What did I tell you?
Scaring people can be fun.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.765
But being scared isn't.

10:47.991 --> 10:51.577
Okay, look, I'm sorry about the...
The head injury.

10:51.648 --> 10:52.715
Those are for me?

10:52.775 --> 10:54.128
But if you give me another shot,

10:54.156 --> 10:56.996
I promise to deliver
harmless, scary fun.

10:57.227 --> 10:58.489
So what do you say?

10:59.257 --> 11:01.944
I was determined to find out
what actually happened to Misty.

11:02.089 --> 11:04.587
Even if that meant going to
the Chatswin country club.

11:04.983 --> 11:07.053
Ho just died. Sucks.

11:07.098 --> 11:09.706
Before she died, Misty
was super funny.

11:09.829 --> 11:11.387
Why, because she called
everything "redonk"?

11:14.496 --> 11:15.802
It's happening all over again.

11:16.010 --> 11:18.115
We are not losing our
only friend to Dalia.

11:18.518 --> 11:19.410
I have other friends.

11:21.068 --> 11:22.672
Well, I don't.

11:32.196 --> 11:33.389
What is with these people?

11:33.437 --> 11:34.578
Okay, George.

11:35.555 --> 11:38.525
I'm in my
ready-to-be-scared clothes.

11:39.025 --> 11:40.160
Aah!

11:40.533 --> 11:41.340
Yes, you are.

11:41.372 --> 11:43.712
Okay, uh, we have the classics here.

11:43.767 --> 11:46.153
We have "the exorcist," "the
omen," and "Rosemary's baby."

11:46.196 --> 11:47.029
Pick your poison.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.007
Can't we just "sex and
the" "city," the sequel?

11:49.075 --> 11:51.012
N-no. We're trying to
scare you, not me.

11:51.056 --> 11:52.097
All right, well,

11:52.222 --> 11:54.434
then how about the one with
the cute, little baby?

11:54.557 --> 11:55.144
Great.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.441
But just to warn you, the cute,
little baby is the devil.

11:57.465 --> 11:58.414
Then "the exorcist."

11:58.447 --> 12:00.518
Well, ok, the little
girl's devil.

12:00.547 --> 12:02.350
- Okay, then "the omen".
- Little boy's devil.

12:02.409 --> 12:04.535
Okay, George, just pick one.
Surprise me.

12:04.572 --> 12:05.505
Okay.

12:06.463 --> 12:07.397
First time I saw this,

12:07.398 --> 12:09.658
I didn't sleep without a
crucifix for a month.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.513
Okay. You ready?

12:15.843 --> 12:17.118
Ready.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.982
As
long as I can have squeezing privileges.

12:19.032 --> 12:21.901
Squeeze all
you want, just no nails.

12:23.654 --> 12:24.417
Look.

12:24.687 --> 12:26.096
- They're optional.
- Oh.

12:26.130 --> 12:27.467
Now I'm scared.

12:27.650 --> 12:28.350
Thanks.

12:29.636 --> 12:30.636
Popcorn?

12:31.369 --> 12:33.229
- Uh, sure.
- Oh.

12:35.682 --> 12:37.149
Aah! Oh! I gotcha!

12:37.956 --> 12:39.811
Oh, very, very impressive.
Not bad.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.383
Well, there's more
where that came from.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.174
Yeah, you know,

12:42.175 --> 12:43.328
if you really
wanted to scare me,

12:43.313 --> 12:45.144
you should have put some of
those blue nails on here.

12:45.221 --> 12:46.694
They would
have popped right off.

12:46.716 --> 12:47.483
Oh!

12:47.745 --> 12:48.545
I love it.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.494
Ah.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.039
Look how cute that is.

12:59.717 --> 13:01.651
What the...

13:02.148 --> 13:03.748
George?

13:08.925 --> 13:10.736
Misty has you in her grip.

13:12.111 --> 13:14.642
There's only one way
to free you, Tessa...

13:15.435 --> 13:17.366
If you still respond
to that name.

13:17.434 --> 13:19.635
I do still respond to that name.

13:19.819 --> 13:20.864
That's my name.

13:21.059 --> 13:22.985
We're performing an exorcism...

13:23.159 --> 13:24.507
Tonight.

13:25.481 --> 13:28.066
But we don't have a lot of time.
"Hoarders" comes on in an hour.

13:28.103 --> 13:29.229
Why is he dressed like a pimp?

13:29.256 --> 13:30.547
I'm the guy from run- D.M.C.

13:31.219 --> 13:32.093
He's a reverend.

13:33.325 --> 13:34.971
Look, this is the best I
could do on short notice.

13:35.034 --> 13:36.433
Don't engage her, Malik.

13:36.621 --> 13:39.205
She's just being a bitch because
she's possessed by Misty.

13:39.556 --> 13:40.450
Right, Misty?

13:40.493 --> 13:42.486
Right... Lisa.

13:45.113 --> 13:46.219
That's not funny.

13:47.446 --> 13:48.315
Aah!

13:50.952 --> 13:52.412
What do you think?

13:52.640 --> 13:53.774
My palms are sweaty,

13:53.842 --> 13:54.907
and my heart is racing.

13:54.975 --> 13:56.209
I think I'm gonna die.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.901
It is really enjoyable.

13:58.971 --> 13:59.679
See?

13:59.746 --> 14:01.985
Can we please have
a scary Halloween?

14:02.282 --> 14:04.236
And can I grease
up my guillotine

14:04.237 --> 14:05.672
and let some heads roll?

14:06.067 --> 14:07.001
Okay, yes.

14:07.216 --> 14:09.144
Go for it
before it's too late.

14:09.711 --> 14:11.310
I am gonna send off
a quick e-mail

14:11.311 --> 14:12.727
to the neighborhood association

14:12.728 --> 14:14.142
and let 'em know I said okay.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.214
Dallas... thank you.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.592
I'll kill you last.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.844
I appreciate that.
I have dinner plans tomorrow.

14:35.188 --> 14:36.219
Dallas?

14:38.459 --> 14:39.949
Uh-oh!

14:41.313 --> 14:43.816
Sounds like there's a
scary thing at the door.

14:44.757 --> 14:46.220
Better defend myself.

14:50.660 --> 14:52.260
Aha!

14:53.426 --> 14:54.832
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

14:54.892 --> 14:55.726
Who am I?

14:55.965 --> 14:58.157
Uhh!

15:01.986 --> 15:02.774
Officer Breen?

15:03.161 --> 15:04.031
Hey, hey!

15:04.171 --> 15:06.697
Hey, it's Steven Royce.
How are you, you son of a gun?

15:07.484 --> 15:09.514
Hey, I'm on the phone.
No talking, okay?

15:09.661 --> 15:10.594
Don't be rude.

15:11.131 --> 15:12.606
Yeah, the reason I'm calling

15:12.632 --> 15:13.594
is I'm trying to find out

15:13.595 --> 15:15.403
if I had a break-in or
not here at the house.

15:15.408 --> 15:17.979
You didn't have a break-in.
I'm with Dallas.

15:18.159 --> 15:19.206
What... what do you mean,
you're with Dallas?

15:19.209 --> 15:20.175
I'm not with Dallas.

15:20.201 --> 15:22.593
I'm here with Dallas,
at the house.

15:22.653 --> 15:23.747
This is my house.
I own this house.

15:23.785 --> 15:24.920
Fine. It's your house.

15:24.941 --> 15:26.603
I have a very strict no-shoe policy.
Why are your shoes on?

15:26.645 --> 15:29.060
Well, Dallas didn't
mention the shoe policy.

15:29.457 --> 15:31.497
Steven, you're home.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.306
And I see you met our
new neighbour, George.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.547
Hello, Steven. Welcome home.

15:36.798 --> 15:37.832
What's with the shoes?

15:38.470 --> 15:39.604
I'm sorry.

15:39.967 --> 15:42.374
I really appreciate
you concern for me,

15:42.405 --> 15:44.409
but I'm not possessed.

15:45.799 --> 15:46.850
Look.

15:49.564 --> 15:51.252
That's as far as
I can move my head.

15:53.781 --> 15:56.313
Hey. Trick-or-treaters...I should go.

15:56.431 --> 15:57.317
Tessa,

15:57.559 --> 16:00.856
if you can hear me, lie
down on the table.

16:01.949 --> 16:02.957
Whatever.

16:04.650 --> 16:06.651
She can still hear me.

16:07.249 --> 16:09.471
When you guys are done, do
you wanna go get for real?

16:16.948 --> 16:18.545
Cut the crap, Misty,
you little bitch,

16:18.576 --> 16:20.372
and go back to hell
where you belong!

16:22.789 --> 16:24.392
Can we please pause the exorcism

16:24.393 --> 16:26.495
so I can go give these
kids their candy?

16:26.593 --> 16:28.760
I'd rather not.
I feel like we have some momentum.

16:30.766 --> 16:31.598
Open up!

16:31.650 --> 16:32.940
I know you're in there!

16:33.030 --> 16:33.964
Wait.

16:34.148 --> 16:35.556
I-I know that voice.

16:36.609 --> 16:39.116
- Who's there?
- It's Misty, Ho.

16:42.622 --> 16:44.328
I wasn't expecting
you until tomorrow.

16:44.657 --> 16:45.870
Well, I came home a day early

16:45.871 --> 16:48.178
because I wanted to rush home
and see my beautiful wife.

16:48.230 --> 16:48.727
Oh.

16:48.739 --> 16:50.729
May...
May I, uh, may I kiss you?

16:50.985 --> 16:52.589
- You may.
- Yes, I may.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.654
Okay.

16:54.765 --> 16:55.531
Mm.

17:00.624 --> 17:01.602
Mm!

17:02.193 --> 17:02.893
Good to be home.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.992
So... how did it go?

17:06.423 --> 17:07.984
Did you close the account

17:07.986 --> 17:10.422
or land that big
thingie or whatever?

17:10.436 --> 17:11.976
I have no idea what he does,

17:12.614 --> 17:13.715
but he's the best at it.

17:13.817 --> 17:15.814
She doesn't care what I do as
long as it keeps her in Gucci.

17:15.924 --> 17:17.380
- This isn't Gucci.
- What is it, then?

17:17.587 --> 17:18.579
It's Cavalli.

17:18.632 --> 17:19.875
Cavalli. That's...

17:20.348 --> 17:21.451
That's the thing about Dallas.

17:21.452 --> 17:22.993
She knows how to put
an outfit together.

17:23.936 --> 17:25.604
I'm gonna grab my stuff.

17:27.664 --> 17:29.637
Why does he...
Why does he have stuff?

17:29.728 --> 17:31.333
Tessa, don't.

17:31.352 --> 17:32.958
Don't do it. Don't do it.
I mean it.

17:32.981 --> 17:34.659
- Come on!
- I drove all the way from Paramus!

17:34.666 --> 17:36.604
- Paramus, you guys.
- D-don't!

17:36.672 --> 17:37.867
- Opening the door.
- No!

17:37.967 --> 17:39.677
Happy Halloween.

17:40.982 --> 17:43.817
Trick or treat, losers?
I used to live here.

17:44.221 --> 17:45.121
Misty?

17:46.192 --> 17:47.225
I thought you were dead.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.937
Lisa, still redonk, I see.

17:51.742 --> 17:53.333
Aah!

17:53.987 --> 17:56.444
That's stings!
What is that, you pimp?

17:56.514 --> 17:57.289
Holy water.

17:59.857 --> 18:02.045
It's ginger ale. Sorry.

18:05.609 --> 18:06.756
Wow.

18:07.069 --> 18:09.084
My bedroom is so
much uglier now.

18:10.124 --> 18:11.280
Thank you.

18:12.655 --> 18:14.805
I-I still don't get
how you're alive.

18:15.410 --> 18:18.252
Your... your parents said that
you went to a better place.

18:18.338 --> 18:19.843
Yeah, I did.

18:20.950 --> 18:23.010
"A better place" is a remedial
school in New Jersey.

18:23.316 --> 18:26.199
Wow. I-I didn't realize
that you were that stupid.

18:26.779 --> 18:27.968
Should've said something.

18:28.166 --> 18:31.376
But why would Mr.
wolfe say that you were dead?

18:31.434 --> 18:32.409
To him, I am.

18:33.044 --> 18:35.969
I did really bad on my
standardized testing, you guys.

18:36.173 --> 18:39.078
And he didn't want to besmirch
Chatswin's educational record.

18:39.594 --> 18:40.563
"Besmirch"!

18:40.602 --> 18:41.798
That's a great word, Misty.

18:41.862 --> 18:43.095
And way to use it correctly.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.231
Oh, thanks, you guys. Thanks.

18:46.098 --> 18:48.415
Anyway, I guess it was
just easier to say

18:48.478 --> 18:49.776
I went to a better place

18:49.846 --> 18:52.713
than to say I went
to "a better place."

18:53.523 --> 18:54.255
But...

18:55.136 --> 18:57.271
Now that I'm not stupid anymore,

18:57.799 --> 18:59.040
my parents said it's, uh,

18:59.041 --> 19:01.223
okay if I come back for
trick-or-treating.

19:02.098 --> 19:04.052
- Oops. Oh, that...
- Excuse me.

19:04.152 --> 19:06.268
That's...
That's nice.

19:06.651 --> 19:08.813
I think she just stole
your nail Polish.

19:08.836 --> 19:10.928
She could take the nail Polish.
That was fine.

19:11.660 --> 19:12.878
I was just secretly relieved

19:12.879 --> 19:14.835
that she didn't ask for
her cat clock back,

19:15.469 --> 19:17.733
because just like the
suburbs on Halloween,

19:18.085 --> 19:20.278
it had kind of started
to grow on me.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.364
So, uh, sorry.

19:24.588 --> 19:26.365
That was weird. Was that weird?

19:26.384 --> 19:28.831
No! Not at all.

19:29.313 --> 19:31.463
I could tell Steven
really liked you.

19:31.516 --> 19:33.562
Ah. From... from the way
he punched me in the face?

19:33.598 --> 19:35.091
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.504
Are you okay?

19:37.945 --> 19:39.011
Cavalli, huh?

19:40.591 --> 19:41.732
Yeah.

19:43.358 --> 19:44.402
So...

19:45.507 --> 19:47.059
Happy Halloween, George.

19:48.682 --> 19:49.131
Oh.

19:49.195 --> 19:50.490
- Happy Halloween!
- Aah!

19:52.993 --> 19:53.865
Bye.

19:53.911 --> 19:55.083
Bye.

20:01.369 --> 20:02.436
He's got a goatee, huh?

20:05.106 --> 20:06.240
Well, George,

20:06.697 --> 20:07.745
I think we did it.

20:08.692 --> 20:09.592
Oh, yeah.

20:09.628 --> 20:11.673
This
place looks great.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.772
Oh, your "march of the
venomous" "spiders" idea...

20:13.825 --> 20:15.115
Nice touch.

20:15.498 --> 20:17.263
Oh, stop.

20:17.328 --> 20:18.765
You're too kind.

20:19.684 --> 20:21.467
Seriously, you're supposed
to be an executioner.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.915
Oh. Hey, kids.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.861
Happy Halloween!

20:27.151 --> 20:28.062
You want candy?

20:28.071 --> 20:29.071
Nice costumes.

20:29.107 --> 20:30.474
Hey, guys.

20:30.815 --> 20:32.844
All right, kids. Don't go yet.

20:32.911 --> 20:35.630
There's more. You ready?

20:36.563 --> 20:39.538
Prepare to meet thy maker.

20:42.911 --> 20:43.764
What, this?

20:44.439 --> 20:46.194
You're scared of this?!

20:46.643 --> 20:49.233
(Tessa and George laughing,

20:49.918 --> 20:50.918
children screaming)

20:51.931 --> 20:54.065
Ah, happy Halloween!

20:56.328 --> 20:57.282
Ohh.

20:58.202 --> 21:00.683
You are really
good at Halloween.

21:00.708 --> 21:01.732
Oh.

21:02.185 --> 21:04.055
I'm the best.
