Brinkman, Gilvary,
you're on the clock.

You want to chitchat,
do it on your own time.

00:07.422 --> 00:10.638
Yeah, you got it, boss.
Yo, Stutkowski, slow down!

00:10.726 --> 00:12.859
This isn't the Daytona 500.

00:12.978 --> 00:14.945
Geez, every morning.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.274
- Almost go time.
- Yeah.

01:30.362 --> 01:32.362
Those seats are
as good as ours.

01:32.685 --> 01:35.495
Seats? What seats?

01:36.859 --> 01:38.776
Hello? I'm talking here.

01:38.893 --> 01:40.977
Shh.
You're distracting us.

01:41.065 --> 01:42.955
Comic-Con badges

01:43.043 --> 01:44.924
Three minutes, 24 seconds.

01:45.012 --> 01:47.235
Oh, yeah, isn't that
that nerd convention

01:47.323 --> 01:49.784
where losers dress up
like elves or whatever?

01:50.618 --> 01:52.657
Well, technically yes,
but it's more than that.

01:52.745 --> 01:55.002
Yeah, so much more,
you have no idea.

01:55.090 --> 01:57.172
And this year's Con
is gonna be epic.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.571
For the 50th anniversary,

01:58.659 --> 01:59.543
they announced they're
gonna have

01:59.590 --> 02:01.135
a secret, surprise
guest panelist.

02:01.223 --> 02:03.141
Mm-hmm.
We made a few calls,

02:03.229 --> 02:05.526
and wefound out
who it might be.

02:05.614 --> 02:06.832
You ready for this?

02:06.920 --> 02:08.283
So ready.

02:08.463 --> 02:10.979
- George freakin' Lucas.
- Ha!

02:11.067 --> 02:13.635
Oh, yeah. Who?

02:14.737 --> 02:16.479
What do you mean who?
Are you kidding?

02:16.580 --> 02:17.791
Uh...

02:17.987 --> 02:20.695
Star Wars, American Graffiti,

02:20.782 --> 02:22.432
THX 1138.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.846
Oh, yeah, those are
movies, right?

02:23.934 --> 02:25.198
Oh, God, it hurts.

02:25.299 --> 02:26.870
Nick, how do you
not know this?

02:26.958 --> 02:28.793
I don't know, I think
it's because I have a life.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.641
- Yeah, a sheltered one.
- We don't have time to deal with

02:31.729 --> 02:33.403
your cinematic
shortcomings right now.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.422
You got that right.
Grab your gear.

02:35.510 --> 02:37.107
Got a dead Marine in Arlington.

02:37.195 --> 02:40.674
Ooh, but badges go on sale
in 95 seconds.

02:40.762 --> 02:43.987
Yeah, it seems like Gibbs
doesn't care about Greg Lucas.

02:44.075 --> 02:45.838
BISHOP/McGEE:
- George! - George!

02:48.565 --> 02:50.666
McGEE: You're the person
in charge here, Mr. Lewis?

02:50.754 --> 02:52.365
Yeah, I'm the foreman.

02:52.453 --> 02:54.307
But my crew had nothing
to do with this.

02:54.395 --> 02:57.033
We broke ground on this site
just yesterday. Building what?

02:57.121 --> 02:59.602
The entire plot's being turned
into luxury condos.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.061
What was here before?

03:01.149 --> 03:03.673
Nothing. The land's been vacant
for almost 20 years.

03:03.761 --> 03:05.285
What time did you
discover the remains?

03:05.373 --> 03:06.705
7:45 a.m.

03:07.338 --> 03:10.041
The body...
you know who it is?

03:10.282 --> 03:11.775
Um, not yet.

03:11.863 --> 03:13.125
Identification?

03:13.213 --> 03:17.400
No military I.D., name tag,
dog tag or wallet.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.595
- Where is Palmer?
- Stuck in traffic.

03:19.683 --> 03:21.283
He should be here
any minute.

03:21.512 --> 03:23.471
But I doubt he'd be able
to give us a time of death.

03:23.558 --> 03:25.517
I mean, this Marine has
been dead for years.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.064
At least 18.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.371
How do you know that?

03:28.458 --> 03:31.275
She doesn't have any
Global War on Terror ribbons.

03:31.363 --> 03:32.634
Oh.

03:34.853 --> 03:38.947
Well, should narrow it down
in the missing persons database.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.681
Gibbs?

03:43.134 --> 03:44.476
Widen the perimeter.

03:44.564 --> 03:47.337
I want all of this
bagged and processed.

03:48.158 --> 03:49.484
You know, today's technology

03:49.572 --> 03:51.179
is advancing at
such a fast rate

03:51.267 --> 03:54.041
that a few years
is equivalent to a lifetime.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.806
Case in point... cell phones.

03:57.894 --> 03:59.925
These are not just for
making phone calls anymore.

04:00.013 --> 04:01.406
Oh, no. No, no.

04:01.501 --> 04:04.985
I can, uh... I can video chat
with Breena and Victoria.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.020
And I can stream a show,
download music,

04:08.108 --> 04:09.563
film a video, read a book.

04:09.651 --> 04:12.420
Ah, we've accomplished so much,
yet we still can't figure out

04:12.508 --> 04:14.665
how to make the DMV
a pleasant experience.

04:14.753 --> 04:15.928
Make an appointment online.

04:16.016 --> 04:17.047
You can do that?

04:17.135 --> 04:19.329
Wait, youknow how
to do that?

04:20.728 --> 04:22.532
All right, moving on.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.626
Luckily for us,
our victim's remains

04:24.714 --> 04:27.172
were discovered before they were
damaged by the excavator.

04:27.260 --> 04:29.567
I just sent here uniform
up to Kasie for analysis.

04:29.655 --> 04:30.704
- Cause of death?
- Well,

04:30.792 --> 04:33.391
these several cracked ribs here
do indicate a struggle,

04:33.479 --> 04:36.946
but the fatal blow
came in the back of the skull here.

04:37.034 --> 04:38.532
But the really
interesting part comes

04:38.620 --> 04:40.133
when we look at
the victim's teeth.

04:40.221 --> 04:43.268
I ran the serial number
on a surgical implant

04:43.356 --> 04:45.836
for her left canine incisor.

04:45.924 --> 04:48.305
And, Gibbs, I got a hit.

04:48.393 --> 04:50.055
Meet our victim,

04:50.498 --> 04:52.368
Major Ellen Wallace.

04:58.709 --> 05:00.467
<i>Breaking news out of D.C.,</i>

05:00.573 --> 05:02.162
<i>Department of Defense officials</i>

05:02.250 --> 05:05.201
<i>have confirmed that among
the casualties in the attack</i>

05:05.296 --> 05:07.701
<i>was Marine Major Ellen Wallace.</i>

05:07.890 --> 05:10.278
<i>We'll continue to bring you
more information</i>

05:10.366 --> 05:11.600
<i>as it comes in.</i>

05:19.725 --> 05:21.631
That's impossible.
That's exactly my point.

05:21.719 --> 05:23.951
Ellen Wallace was not
a missing person.

05:24.039 --> 05:27.319
In fact, DoD listed her
as killed in action in...

05:27.407 --> 05:29.194
The Pentagon, on 9/11.

05:31.941 --> 05:35.988
Then how did her
perfectly intact remains

05:36.076 --> 05:39.598
find their way to a shallow
grave some 12 miles away?

05:51.676 --> 05:52.863
How much?

05:53.582 --> 05:55.676
That's highway robbery.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.551
Fine. I hate to play
this card, but you owe me.

06:00.035 --> 06:03.527
No, no,
I'm not threatening you.

06:03.944 --> 06:06.597
Oh, okay, well,
I guess we'll see.

06:06.685 --> 06:10.902
Mm-hmm.
Tell Mom I said hi.

06:12.152 --> 06:13.341
What got you in a twist?

06:13.429 --> 06:14.996
Comic-Con badges sold out,

06:15.084 --> 06:17.207
and every ticket broker
or connection I have

06:17.295 --> 06:19.152
is 1,500 a pop.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.779
Dollars?
For a convention?

06:22.097 --> 06:23.285
Who'd pay that?

06:23.373 --> 06:25.246
I would, if I had
that kind of cash.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.558
Guess what.
You don't need it.

06:27.646 --> 06:28.910
Why? What have you heard?

06:28.998 --> 06:31.566
Delilah scored three VIP badges.

06:31.654 --> 06:33.612
No.I am totally serious.

06:33.707 --> 06:35.152
Aah!

06:37.652 --> 06:39.071
Yeah.

06:39.158 --> 06:40.191
Wow.

06:40.279 --> 06:41.793
You know, just being
near you two,

06:41.881 --> 06:44.059
I can feel my
cool factor dropping.

06:44.147 --> 06:45.186
Give me an update.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.262
Let's go. All right.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.402
Our victim is Ellen Wallace,

06:49.490 --> 06:51.895
38 years old,
a major in the Marine Corps.

06:51.983 --> 06:53.989
Public Affairs division,
stationed out of the Pentagon.

06:54.076 --> 06:56.488
Wallace was listed as KIA
when her office was struck

06:56.576 --> 06:58.402
by Flight 77 on 9/11.

06:58.490 --> 07:00.387
Some victims' remains
were never recovered

07:00.475 --> 07:01.520
in the attacks,
and she was thought

07:01.607 --> 07:02.543
to have been one of them.

07:02.631 --> 07:03.911
Her death gathered
media attention

07:03.998 --> 07:06.629
because she's the daughter
of General James Wallace.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.196
Guy's a military legend.

07:08.291 --> 07:11.746
He led missions in Vietnam,
Lebanon, Liberia and Iraq.

07:11.834 --> 07:14.270
Not to mention serving
as an advisor to the White House

07:14.358 --> 07:15.824
after his retirement in 2007.

07:15.912 --> 07:17.402
Yeah, I got it.

07:17.490 --> 07:18.578
Get back to her.

07:18.666 --> 07:20.660
Well, we now know
that her remains

07:20.748 --> 07:22.160
were not in the Pentagon.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.824
She wasn't in the building.

07:24.957 --> 07:26.698
Well, where was she killed?

07:26.786 --> 07:28.314
We don't know that yet.

07:28.402 --> 07:30.059
- Why was she killed?
- Well,

07:30.356 --> 07:32.363
we don't know that yet, either.

07:33.402 --> 07:34.941
Suspects?

07:35.566 --> 07:37.223
Well, we don't have those.

07:37.973 --> 07:39.371
Find out!

07:39.863 --> 07:42.035
Track her final movements.

07:42.123 --> 07:43.816
Who saw her last?

07:45.496 --> 07:47.988
Do your damn jobs!

07:51.283 --> 07:53.329
Wh-What was that about?

07:54.832 --> 07:56.645
Of course I remember that day.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.957
When you cheat death, the
details tend to stick with you.

08:00.073 --> 08:02.059
You worked with
Major Ellen Wallace

08:02.161 --> 08:04.215
back in 2001,
Miss Tano?

08:04.369 --> 08:07.004
Yeah. A lifetime ago.

08:07.770 --> 08:10.840
I was just a green
junior officer back then,

08:11.231 --> 08:13.707
and Ellen was my
department head.

08:14.039 --> 08:15.824
She took me under her wing,

08:16.098 --> 08:17.715
encouraged me.

08:19.418 --> 08:21.825
I regret never having
thanked her for that.

08:22.090 --> 08:23.949
When was the last time
you saw her?

08:24.874 --> 08:28.598
Oh, the night of
September 10, 2001.

08:29.318 --> 08:31.103
We both attended
a command-wide.

08:31.191 --> 08:33.643
"Hail and Farewell" dinner
at a restaurant in Georgetown.

08:33.731 --> 08:35.621
Did anything seem out
of the ordinary to you?

08:35.710 --> 08:36.816
No, not really.

08:36.904 --> 08:38.840
I mean, I could tell
Ellen was distracted.

08:38.967 --> 08:41.263
I assumed it was work-related
since she left the party early

08:41.350 --> 08:42.496
to go back to the Pentagon.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.520
- What time was that?
- 8:30.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.658
Like I said,
the details stuck with me.

08:49.736 --> 08:53.088
Did she ever mention ever
having issues with anyone?

08:53.176 --> 08:55.471
No, not directly.
Well, I did hear

08:55.559 --> 08:57.939
that she had a complicated
relationship with her ex-fiancÃ©.

08:58.027 --> 09:01.174
So you never saw her in the
office the morning of 9/11?

09:01.262 --> 09:04.892
No. We were both scheduled to
attend a briefing at 1000 hours,

09:05.002 --> 09:08.291
but I got rear-ended on my
way in and I was running late.

09:12.978 --> 09:15.720
That inconvenience
ended up saving my life.

09:16.011 --> 09:18.448
When the plane
struck the Pentagon,

09:18.712 --> 09:21.533
our offices were directly hit...

09:22.779 --> 09:25.478
and no one else
in my division survived.

09:27.759 --> 09:29.172
Why would
the DoD think that

09:29.260 --> 09:31.228
she was in the building
at the time of the attack?

09:31.439 --> 09:35.236
Because Ellen was at work
at 0730 every morning,

09:35.830 --> 09:38.564
and her car was found
on the premises.

09:40.063 --> 09:42.088
Where else could she have been?

09:47.166 --> 09:49.647
Last I heard, General
Wallace was retired.

09:49.892 --> 09:51.642
I suppose,
technically speaking,

09:51.730 --> 09:54.236
but a Marine
never really retires.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.072
How long's he been a guest
lecturer at the Academy?

09:57.181 --> 09:58.986
I brought him on
about three years ago.

09:59.074 --> 10:00.815
He's a favorite
among midshipmen.

10:01.095 --> 10:02.878
There's a tremendous amount
that they can learn from someone

10:02.965 --> 10:04.488
as experienced as the general.

10:04.623 --> 10:06.233
Sounds like you
know him well.

10:06.327 --> 10:07.408
Had the pleasure
of serving

10:07.496 --> 10:09.314
under his command
many years ago.

10:09.402 --> 10:11.455
Owe my career to the man.
He's like family,

10:11.682 --> 10:14.002
which is why
I am concerned.

10:14.159 --> 10:16.246
I witnessed the toll
the death of his daughter

10:16.334 --> 10:18.249
took on him back in 2001.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.564
He shouldn't have to suffer
through that pain again.

10:20.738 --> 10:22.566
No one should, General.

10:22.817 --> 10:26.994
The military has rules
and the military gives orders,

10:27.252 --> 10:29.250
but what happens
when those two

10:29.338 --> 10:31.408
are in direct conflict
with one another?

10:31.876 --> 10:34.001
Combat scenario number 67:

10:34.189 --> 10:36.471
you're deployed to a combat zone
when your convoy

10:36.613 --> 10:40.086
comes upon a group of possible
Taliban insurgents.

10:40.174 --> 10:42.596
They haven't engaged you,
but your gut

10:42.684 --> 10:46.478
is telling you that things
are going to go south, and fast.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.750
Do you let rules dictated
in some handbook

10:48.838 --> 10:52.869
override your instincts,
or do you take action?

10:54.486 --> 10:57.135
Ticktock, ladies and gentlemen.

10:57.283 --> 10:59.375
Your enemies could be seconds
away from killing you.

10:59.462 --> 11:01.856
Do you strike first?

11:02.056 --> 11:03.533
Negative.

11:06.287 --> 11:07.593
Only after the enemy

11:07.681 --> 11:10.172
has engaged does
a U.S. service member

11:10.260 --> 11:11.822
take offensive measures.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.273
Regulations also say
you have the right to take

11:14.361 --> 11:16.494
appropriate actions
to defend yourself.

11:16.621 --> 11:18.971
Hesitation could
cost you your life.

11:19.134 --> 11:23.399
Yeah, but suspicion
isn't fact, it's fear.

11:23.728 --> 11:25.580
Break the rules
of engagement,

11:26.549 --> 11:28.230
you've already lost.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.962
Right answer.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.806
I should see you all
writing that down.

11:38.243 --> 11:40.273
Should've known
NCIS wouldn't show up here

11:40.361 --> 11:41.681
to deliver good news.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.017
Occupational hazard, General.

11:44.244 --> 11:46.375
While I appreciate you
telling me in person, Gibbs,

11:46.463 --> 11:49.189
I can't say that makes it
any easier to hear.

11:50.205 --> 11:52.297
Give it
to me straight.

11:53.228 --> 11:55.170
What happened
to my daughter?

12:00.471 --> 12:02.189
The investigation's ongoing.

12:02.302 --> 12:03.652
We're looking into it.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.377
You're looking into it?

12:06.385 --> 12:07.205
Someone murdered

12:07.293 --> 12:08.884
my little girl
and has gotten away with it

12:08.971 --> 12:10.703
for the past 18 years.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.158
I want him found.General.

12:14.486 --> 12:15.625
I'm on it.

12:18.149 --> 12:21.599
Of all my regrets in life,
not having more time for Ellen

12:21.687 --> 12:22.945
is at the top of the list.

12:23.390 --> 12:25.461
You know what my last words
to her were?

12:26.544 --> 12:29.416
"We'll talk later,
I'm running late."

12:31.398 --> 12:32.419
When was that?

12:32.507 --> 12:34.771
The night of September 10th
in the Pentagon.

12:35.054 --> 12:38.382
I passed by her office
on my way out around 2300 hours.

12:38.561 --> 12:40.868
Not being late to drinks
with a colleague

12:40.955 --> 12:45.171
was more important than talking
to my own daughter.

12:46.296 --> 12:47.918
Regret is a... Yeah.

12:48.005 --> 12:49.311
It's a son of a bitch.

12:55.496 --> 12:58.804
You see this through
to the end, Gibbs.

13:00.789 --> 13:02.541
No matter what.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.054
Understood.

13:06.142 --> 13:09.398
These are the most disorganized
bins I have ever seen.

13:09.592 --> 13:12.685
I could go full
Marie Kondo on these.

13:12.773 --> 13:14.146
Okay, you're a little
too excited

13:14.234 --> 13:16.257
about some dusty containers.

13:16.890 --> 13:19.187
Oh! Floppy disks.

13:19.296 --> 13:20.976
Cool!

13:21.289 --> 13:22.750
Ooh, look who's a little

13:22.838 --> 13:24.535
- "too excited" now.
- Oh, come on.

13:24.623 --> 13:26.930
These things are relics. Ugh.

13:29.819 --> 13:31.560
I feel just like Dr. Grant

13:31.648 --> 13:34.399
when he first sees the
Brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.586
You mean Brontosaurus?

13:35.674 --> 13:38.130
Uh, no. You don't want
to go toe-to-toe with me

13:38.218 --> 13:39.937
on some JPtrivia.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.218
This is sad, isn't it?

13:44.452 --> 13:46.484
I mean, the contents
of these bins

13:46.572 --> 13:50.656
are all that's left of Ellen
Wallace, and they were just

13:50.890 --> 13:53.941
- sitting in a storage unit.
- Ah, well,

13:54.028 --> 13:55.694
they say you can
learn a lot about someone

13:55.782 --> 13:57.306
based on
what they leave behind.

13:57.417 --> 13:59.375
Wonder what we'll learn
from her things.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.007
Uh, well,

14:02.601 --> 14:06.490
how about the identity
of her ex-fiancÃ©?

14:06.578 --> 14:09.086
- Oh, yeah, that's a tart.
- Mm-hmm.

14:10.030 --> 14:11.671
Wait, is that Gibbs?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.971
And a hot Gibbs?

14:14.096 --> 14:16.668
Yeah, Gibbs didn't just know
Ellen Wallace,

14:16.839 --> 14:18.793
he was engaged to her.

14:28.715 --> 14:30.642
<i>Do you agree
with the Pentagon's decision</i>

14:30.730 --> 14:33.548
<i>to prevent women from serving
on the front lines?</i>

14:33.769 --> 14:36.642
<i>As a Marine, it is my duty
to serve my country</i>

14:36.738 --> 14:38.908
<i>and to follow the orders
of my chain of command.</i>

14:39.035 --> 14:41.257
<i>That being said,
it's been my experience</i>

14:41.345 --> 14:43.507
<i>that there is no gender
distinction when it comes</i>

14:43.595 --> 14:46.963
<i>to the capabilities and courage
of our military service members.</i>

14:47.051 --> 14:48.502
<i>I believe that any Marine
who meets</i>

14:48.590 --> 14:50.765
<i>the physical and mental
qualifications deserves</i>

14:50.853 --> 14:52.314
<i>the same consideration.</i>

14:52.447 --> 14:55.181
Equal rights
are not special rights.

14:57.377 --> 14:58.720
She was engaged to Gibbs?

14:58.808 --> 15:01.791
How could Gibbs not tell us that
he was engaged to the victim?

15:01.931 --> 15:04.791
Are you kidding? Gibbs never
talks about his personal life.

15:04.923 --> 15:06.831
Hmm. We only find out about it
when it's part of a case.

15:06.918 --> 15:08.468
Hold up.
This has happened before?

15:08.556 --> 15:09.744
Exhibit A.

15:10.181 --> 15:12.767
Ah, the Gibbs' wives club.

15:13.611 --> 15:16.250
Uh... I'm sorry,
Gibbs was married

15:16.338 --> 15:18.898
four times?
What, does he have a marriage punch card

15:18.986 --> 15:19.908
- and the fifth one is free?
- He had to know

15:19.996 --> 15:21.861
that we would figure it out.

15:22.073 --> 15:24.257
Do we tell him we know,
or do we wait for him to say

15:24.345 --> 15:26.119
that he knows
that we know?

15:26.207 --> 15:28.287
Since we don't know
if it's relevant to the case yet,

15:28.377 --> 15:30.173
we leave it alone, for now.

15:30.261 --> 15:31.741
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

15:31.829 --> 15:33.205
Ooh. Incoming.

15:34.853 --> 15:35.977
Hey, Gibbs.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.322
What do we know?
On the night

15:37.410 --> 15:39.972
of September 10, 2001,
Ellen was seen

15:40.060 --> 15:42.345
at a command-wide Hail
and Farewell in Georgetown

15:42.433 --> 15:44.962
by her former
coworker Amy Tano.

15:45.050 --> 15:48.828
Now, Tano said Ellen left around
2030 hours for the Pentagon.

15:48.916 --> 15:50.601
This was confirmed
by General Wallace.

15:50.689 --> 15:53.900
He said he saw Ellen in her
office at 2300 hours that night.

15:53.988 --> 15:56.640
So far, he's the last person
to have seen Ellen alive.

15:56.728 --> 15:58.421
Bishop,
Torres, verify

15:58.509 --> 16:01.634
Pentagon access codes,
9/10, 9/11.

16:02.158 --> 16:04.673
Pinpoint when she
left the building.

16:04.769 --> 16:07.142
- On it.
- McGee, look into her phone records.

16:07.230 --> 16:09.041
Find out who
she was communicating with.

16:12.154 --> 16:13.736
Boss, is that all?

16:13.900 --> 16:14.969
Is there...

16:15.057 --> 16:16.845
nothing more
you want to tell me?

16:17.377 --> 16:18.525
No.

16:19.806 --> 16:21.291
Okay.

16:30.621 --> 16:33.624
Hey, did we say something funny?
Oh, no, I just, um,

16:34.238 --> 16:37.503
I thought that you asked me
to piece together

16:37.591 --> 16:39.542
the corrupted data
of a security system

16:39.629 --> 16:42.762
that was definitely destroyed
18 years ago.

16:42.971 --> 16:45.192
Yeah.
That is what we're asking.

16:46.747 --> 16:47.934
I'm sorry, um...

16:48.045 --> 16:50.903
Do you have any idea
how complex that request is?

16:51.216 --> 16:52.419
Like, let alone

16:52.507 --> 16:54.299
the specialized manpower
that would be needed

16:54.395 --> 16:56.583
to get it to you by...
by when?

16:56.841 --> 16:58.255
24 hours.

17:00.755 --> 17:02.356
48 hours.

17:02.708 --> 17:05.153
No.
At first, I thought this was funny,

17:05.241 --> 17:07.301
but this is just annoying.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.809
How about
an incentive,

17:10.192 --> 17:11.721
to expedite things?

17:11.809 --> 17:12.880
Like what, Freckles?

17:12.974 --> 17:15.012
Three VIP badges
to Comic-Con.

17:15.145 --> 17:16.276
What? What?

17:16.387 --> 17:18.332
What? W-What? Um...

17:18.920 --> 17:20.617
If you're scamming
me right now,

17:20.704 --> 17:23.316
I will put you
on a watch list so fast.

17:23.404 --> 17:25.075
100% legit.
What do you say?

17:25.163 --> 17:26.178
No, no, no. Hold on.
That...

17:26.265 --> 17:27.237
- we're not...
- Deal. Done.

17:27.325 --> 17:29.489
Yes. Ooh!
Call you when I have something.

17:31.996 --> 17:34.808
You are in
for a world of hurt.

17:35.129 --> 17:36.417
Not finding anything

17:36.505 --> 17:38.760
in Ellen Wallace's
home phone records.

17:38.848 --> 17:42.309
Just a bunch of AOL
dial-up connections. Ooh.

17:42.397 --> 17:44.497
Now, that is something
I haven't said in years.

17:44.666 --> 17:46.190
Any luck with her office line?

17:46.348 --> 17:48.622
Nope. Nothing yet. How
about cell phone records?

17:48.710 --> 17:51.419
Didn't have one.Ah. A disinterest
in mobile technology.

17:51.507 --> 17:54.249
Well, that's at least something
she had in common with Gibbs.

17:54.356 --> 17:57.145
Well, they weren't commonplace
in 2001 like they are today.

17:57.233 --> 18:00.651
Ugh. Tell me about it.
You know, I had a six-year-old

18:00.739 --> 18:03.481
run right into me
while he was texting last week?

18:03.569 --> 18:05.716
So I told him to put
the phone down and go play.

18:05.804 --> 18:09.024
Man, you know, he stepped on
my foot and told me to shut up.

18:09.675 --> 18:12.765
Just, the whole "joy
of children" concept, just...

18:12.852 --> 18:14.520
lost on me.

18:16.614 --> 18:18.293
Earth to McGee.

18:18.427 --> 18:19.598
What?

18:19.685 --> 18:21.294
Did you find something?

18:21.644 --> 18:23.442
Um, I'm not sure.

18:23.675 --> 18:25.278
Ooh. Hold that thought.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.841
That is the blood analysis
from Ellen Wallace's uniform.

18:32.406 --> 18:34.684
Uh, McGee?

18:35.123 --> 18:36.778
We got a problem.

18:37.340 --> 18:39.339
There were two separate
blood profiles

18:39.427 --> 18:40.934
found on her clothing.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.317
Jimmy said there were
signs of a struggle.

18:43.405 --> 18:45.075
The second profile
could be the killer's.

18:45.163 --> 18:46.747
Yeah, I really hope not,

18:46.835 --> 18:49.825
because it's a match to Gibbs.

18:50.944 --> 18:54.083
How'd his blood get
on her uniform?

18:55.372 --> 18:57.636
You do realize
what this means.

19:27.050 --> 19:28.449
Yeah, I'd get the knife
from Gibbs

19:28.537 --> 19:30.911
before interrogating him,
if I were you.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.300
Why are you looking at me?

19:32.388 --> 19:33.645
I'm not going in there.

19:34.317 --> 19:35.520
Good luck, Bishop.

19:35.761 --> 19:37.645
Oh, no, nice try.

19:37.733 --> 19:41.177
No, I've cheated death
a few too many times recently.

19:41.568 --> 19:43.434
Show us how it's done,
McGee.

19:43.598 --> 19:45.094
No. Pass.

19:45.411 --> 19:46.669
You're senior field agent.

19:46.757 --> 19:48.598
Which is exactly
why I should be supervising

19:48.686 --> 19:49.973
and observing
Gibbs' questioning.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.411
Oh, for the love of God.

19:59.545 --> 20:01.078
Okay.

20:01.230 --> 20:04.125
You know how this goes, Gibbs,
so let's skip

20:04.213 --> 20:07.132
the interrogation dance and get
this over with, shall we?

20:07.251 --> 20:08.476
Gladly.

20:09.987 --> 20:13.132
Tell me about your relationship
with Ellen Wallace.

20:15.877 --> 20:16.804
She was an ex.

20:16.892 --> 20:19.218
You mean, uh, ex-fiancÃ©e.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.070
Ex is an ex. How'd you meet?

20:24.127 --> 20:26.546
- Complicated.
- Why did you break it off?

20:27.014 --> 20:28.336
More complicated.

20:28.424 --> 20:30.375
Did it end on good terms?

20:31.961 --> 20:33.109
Does it ever?

20:33.272 --> 20:34.328
Good point.

20:34.465 --> 20:36.101
It's like watching
John McEnroe

20:36.189 --> 20:38.104
and Jimmy Connors
at Wimbledon.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.586
That is the whitest thing
I've ever heard.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.545
Why hide that you knew
the victim?

20:43.413 --> 20:45.395
It wasn't relevant.

20:46.101 --> 20:48.843
Your blood at the crime scene
makes it relevant.

20:50.923 --> 20:53.123
Look, Gibbs, come on,
work with me here.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.953
'Cause I sure as hell know
you didn't kill Major Wallace.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.260
Then why am I sitting here?

20:57.370 --> 21:00.504
Because we need answers
that only you can give.

21:00.716 --> 21:03.849
Like how did your blood
get on Ellen's uniform?

21:14.079 --> 21:15.298
Oh.

21:15.393 --> 21:16.742
Let me see.

21:20.387 --> 21:22.242
Oh, that's gonna stain.

21:22.734 --> 21:23.990
It's a good thing I was here,

21:24.078 --> 21:25.828
otherwise this hand
might be a goner.

21:33.108 --> 21:34.483
There.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.367
That should do it.

21:38.976 --> 21:40.914
You'll get my bill in the mail.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.593
Were you with
Ellen when she died?

21:45.703 --> 21:47.070
No.

21:47.169 --> 21:49.914
When was the last time
you two had contact?

21:50.828 --> 21:52.937
Two months prior to 9/11.

21:54.944 --> 21:56.515
Satisfied?

21:59.523 --> 22:01.492
You didn't catch it, did you?

22:02.741 --> 22:05.921
I asked why you broke it off
and you didn't correct me.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.155
It's interesting.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.878
All of your previous

22:08.966 --> 22:12.125
failed relationships
have one thing in common.

22:12.527 --> 22:15.138
Your exes all ended things.

22:15.336 --> 22:18.000
But that wasn't the
case with Ellen.

22:18.681 --> 22:20.421
She was different,
wasn't she?

22:23.230 --> 22:24.765
Tell me why.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.093
Uh, Gibbs?

22:39.265 --> 22:41.294
- Move, McGee.
- Can't do that, boss.

22:41.381 --> 22:42.593
Your interrogation's
not over.

22:42.681 --> 22:44.683
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

22:44.894 --> 22:47.117
It's over when you
quit lying to us.

22:47.545 --> 22:50.359
You said you hadn't had contact
with Ellen in two months.

22:50.477 --> 22:51.921
I've got phone records

22:52.009 --> 22:53.718
that show that she made
a two-minute call

22:53.806 --> 22:56.148
to your house the last night
she was seen alive.

22:56.319 --> 22:58.078
So what'd you two talk about?

23:00.068 --> 23:01.765
I said we didn't.

23:01.853 --> 23:03.578
You know that's not
good enough, boss.

23:03.665 --> 23:05.054
Hell it ain't.

23:05.239 --> 23:06.718
You're off the case.

23:13.336 --> 23:14.734
What did you say?

23:14.992 --> 23:16.721
I said you're off the case.

23:16.808 --> 23:18.462
Go home, Gibbs.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.837
Is staring
at this helping?

23:46.091 --> 23:48.314
Just running through
things in my head.

23:48.679 --> 23:51.291
How about
verbalizing them?

23:51.379 --> 23:52.720
- With you?
- Mm-hmm.

23:52.808 --> 23:55.006
Sure, I can do that.
You know why?

23:55.094 --> 23:57.545
Because I respect the people
that I work with.

23:57.648 --> 23:59.215
Unlike some people.

23:59.342 --> 24:01.780
Ah, "some people"
being Gibbs.

24:01.868 --> 24:05.089
16 years.
Gibbs has known me for 16 years

24:05.177 --> 24:07.623
- and he still doesn't trust me.
- I don't know about that.

24:07.711 --> 24:09.538
I mean, I understand
that Gibbs likes being

24:09.681 --> 24:11.428
a closed book,
I get that, okay?

24:11.516 --> 24:14.827
But I'm trying to help him and
he refuses to be honest with me.

24:14.937 --> 24:16.905
Did I mention
the 16 years part?

24:16.993 --> 24:19.272
You did. Good,
'cause it bears repeating.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.600
- Mm.
- More like 16 and a half.

24:21.858 --> 24:24.623
Hey, Tim, you have every right

24:24.717 --> 24:27.123
to feel frustrated,
but you got one thing wrong.

24:27.211 --> 24:28.850
Gibbs does trust you.

24:28.938 --> 24:30.648
More than anyone,
think about it.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.130
This case is personal
for him.

24:33.218 --> 24:36.047
Would he have left
if he didn't trust you?

24:36.748 --> 24:39.163
Listen, we all deal
with things differently.

24:39.251 --> 24:41.209
Gibbs' way isn't perfect,

24:41.297 --> 24:42.788
but it gets him through
and he...

24:42.876 --> 24:44.957
I know, I know.
He's got to get there

24:45.045 --> 24:46.350
on his own.Precisely.

24:46.438 --> 24:47.670
But that doesn't mean

24:47.758 --> 24:50.178
you can't lead him
in the right direction.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.561
Wait, it's
been less than 24 hours.

24:54.648 --> 24:55.703
How do you have
something already?

24:55.790 --> 24:57.574
Looks like my
incentive worked.

24:57.894 --> 24:59.553
Three tickets to loser-con,

24:59.641 --> 25:01.334
- as promised.
- Ooh-ho-ho-ho.

25:01.422 --> 25:02.616
Yeah, this helped,

25:02.704 --> 25:05.147
but I am also
just good at my job.

25:05.235 --> 25:08.100
That's, like, why they pay me
the big GS-14 bucks, so...

25:08.248 --> 25:10.512
14?
What do you mean, 14?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.881
How do you have
a higher pay grade than me?

25:12.969 --> 25:14.493
You're not even
old enough to rent a car.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.325
Uh, no, but I could just buy one, so...
Okay.

25:17.413 --> 25:19.121
- Can we get back on track here?
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.209 --> 25:21.194
- What'd you find?
- Yeah, so...

25:21.326 --> 25:24.068
because most of the Pentagon's
systems were damaged

25:24.156 --> 25:26.380
during the terror attack,
I was able to access

25:26.468 --> 25:29.080
an encrypted file;
it was on an old backup server

25:29.168 --> 25:31.280
and it was last
updated at 0800

25:31.368 --> 25:32.491
the morning of 9/11.

25:32.577 --> 25:34.067
So does it list
Ellen Wallace

25:34.155 --> 25:35.343
entering and exiting
the building?

25:35.430 --> 25:37.388
Yeah.
Uh, we have her...

25:37.702 --> 25:41.215
scanning in at 2200 hours
the night of September 10th,

25:41.303 --> 25:43.303
and there is no record
of her ever leaving.

25:43.391 --> 25:45.614
Maybe she, uh, left
and forgot to scan out.

25:45.702 --> 25:47.701
That's not possible.
The Pentagon's points of entry

25:47.788 --> 25:49.660
are all one-for-ones,
so can't get in or out

25:49.748 --> 25:50.950
without scanning your I.D.

25:51.038 --> 25:52.871
So, according to our
logs, Ellen Wallace

25:52.959 --> 25:54.645
should have still been
inside the building

25:54.733 --> 25:56.084
the morning of 9/11.

25:56.202 --> 25:57.210
But she wasn't.

25:57.297 --> 26:00.069
Mm-mm, because
her body was moved.

26:00.248 --> 26:02.239
Ellen was killed
inside the Pentagon

26:02.327 --> 26:04.114
that night and then
taken off-site.

26:04.202 --> 26:06.983
So, our killer...
has to be someone

26:07.071 --> 26:09.117
who worked
in the building with her.

26:09.205 --> 26:10.131
How many?

26:10.235 --> 26:12.889
That's 18,482.

26:13.589 --> 26:18.252
Ooh. But it does
eliminate one suspect.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.152
Thought I locked the door.

26:28.794 --> 26:31.187
I know how to use
my knife, too.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.461
Since you've been
ignoring my calls,

26:36.578 --> 26:38.149
thought I would come
down here and tell you

26:38.236 --> 26:40.984
that you've been
cleared as a suspect.

26:41.074 --> 26:43.180
Not that any of us
thought you were guilty.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.726
Just enough to throw me
off the case.

26:44.814 --> 26:46.598
You got yourself
thrown off the case.

26:46.718 --> 26:49.031
I did exactly what you would do.

26:49.610 --> 26:50.992
Unless, of course,
you burned more

26:51.080 --> 26:53.094
of those rules
that I should know about?

26:54.453 --> 26:55.812
You know, I don't get it.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.015
After all these years,

26:57.103 --> 26:59.088
after everything
we've been through...

26:59.448 --> 27:01.523
...I'm still here with you.

27:01.769 --> 27:03.232
Ah, it's your choice.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.857
No, that's not gonna
work on me, Gibbs.

27:04.945 --> 27:06.031
You think
that we don't know

27:06.119 --> 27:07.570
why you keep us
at a distance?

27:07.658 --> 27:08.680
It's not a mystery.

27:08.838 --> 27:11.381
- Get to the point, McGee.
- Ellen was important to you,

27:11.469 --> 27:12.633
but we can't solve this case

27:12.721 --> 27:13.931
unless you tell us everything
that happened.

27:14.018 --> 27:15.578
- I already did.
- No, you didn't.

27:15.704 --> 27:17.228
You didn't tell us about
the conversation

27:17.315 --> 27:19.100
you had with her
the night she was killed.

27:19.188 --> 27:21.494
Now, whatever Ellen said during
that call could point us

27:21.582 --> 27:22.953
to who was after her.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.759
And I'm not leaving
till I get an answer, Gibbs.

27:24.846 --> 27:26.562
What did you two talk about?

27:28.523 --> 27:31.008
We didn't talk!

27:46.771 --> 27:49.383
Jethro, it's me.

27:50.221 --> 27:52.195
I know we haven't spoken
since...

27:52.283 --> 27:54.590
well, it's been a while.

27:55.292 --> 27:57.164
I've thought a lot about you.

27:57.555 --> 27:59.406
Wondered how you were doing.

28:01.270 --> 28:03.011
Something's come up.

28:03.629 --> 28:05.242
It's important.

28:05.335 --> 28:08.120
We need to talk.
If you're there, pick up.

28:09.712 --> 28:11.015
Please.

28:15.578 --> 28:17.078
I didn't answer the phone.

28:18.383 --> 28:20.859
And I didn't
call her back either.

28:21.601 --> 28:22.890
Why not?

28:23.116 --> 28:26.101
I thought that she wanted
to talk about us.

28:29.572 --> 28:32.836
She was asking...
for me to help.

28:33.959 --> 28:35.680
Asking for my help.

28:40.609 --> 28:42.797
I didn't pick up the damn phone.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.087
Boss, you didn't kill Ellen.

28:46.461 --> 28:48.969
I didn't save her, either.

28:55.094 --> 28:56.562
Maybe I could have.

29:01.445 --> 29:03.562
Then don't make
the same mistake twice.

29:07.659 --> 29:09.750
Ellen still needs
your help, boss.

29:13.090 --> 29:14.500
So do we.

29:31.874 --> 29:33.406
Oh, please don't crash.

29:33.494 --> 29:36.734
Oh, please don't crash,
please don't crash.

29:36.961 --> 29:38.445
Hold the phone.

29:38.547 --> 29:40.890
Is that an
IBM ThinkPad 240X?

29:40.978 --> 29:42.508
You've seen one of
these things before?

29:42.596 --> 29:43.633
I had one of these.

29:43.721 --> 29:45.023
Like 20 years ago.

29:45.111 --> 29:47.887
Oh, this baby came fully loaded
with 64 megs of RAM,

29:47.975 --> 29:50.717
an Intel Celeron 300
Pentium III processor

29:50.804 --> 29:52.414
that clocked in
at 500 megahertz...

29:52.502 --> 29:53.562
And look.

29:54.373 --> 29:55.555
I mean, come on.

29:55.643 --> 29:58.172
That is the flying
toaster screensaver.

29:59.509 --> 30:01.373
You don't seem nearly
as excited about this.

30:01.461 --> 30:02.906
I was. Two hours

30:02.994 --> 30:04.945
and multiple system crashes ago.

30:05.042 --> 30:07.000
Oh, did the victim's laptop
give us anything?

30:07.088 --> 30:09.820
Oh, I found
a private e-mail address

30:09.944 --> 30:11.773
Ellen had been using
on the side.

30:11.861 --> 30:13.485
- To do what?
- Well, the only thing she was

30:13.572 --> 30:14.701
using this account for

30:14.789 --> 30:16.240
was to communicate meet-up times

30:16.328 --> 30:18.138
and locations
with another user

30:18.226 --> 30:20.976
named EyesnEars257.

30:21.064 --> 30:23.023
"East Potomac Park at noon."

30:23.111 --> 30:26.390
Now, that e-mail was sent
September 10, 2001,

30:26.478 --> 30:28.412
the day our victim
was last seen alive.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.669
Okay, so are you able

30:29.756 --> 30:31.859
to find out the identity
of her mystery contact?

30:31.947 --> 30:33.000
Not on this thing.

30:33.088 --> 30:34.242
No.

30:35.429 --> 30:37.677
Time to watch the magic
happen.

30:38.218 --> 30:40.687
Secret e-mail address,

30:40.775 --> 30:43.187
clandestine rendezvous...

30:43.275 --> 30:45.671
Ellen Wallace,
what were you mixed up in?

30:46.935 --> 30:48.502
Oh, and it crashed.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.718
Am I being recorded?

30:53.249 --> 30:55.984
You have to tell me
if this is being recorded.

30:57.376 --> 30:58.929
It's the law.

30:59.803 --> 31:02.197
You seem a little
paranoid, Mr. Morrison.

31:02.285 --> 31:04.632
I'm a journalist who was
grabbed out of his office

31:04.747 --> 31:06.289
by two federal agents
and brought into

31:06.377 --> 31:07.726
an interrogation room.

31:07.814 --> 31:11.046
Paranoia is warranted
in this situation.

31:11.134 --> 31:14.015
All right, I didn't grab,
I guided.

31:14.103 --> 31:17.296
And this is a conference room,
not interrogation.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.031
You tell us
what we need to know

31:19.119 --> 31:20.772
and you won't be seeing
the real thing.

31:21.111 --> 31:22.726
Does the username.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.500
"EyesnEars257"
ring a bell?

31:25.882 --> 31:28.459
It was my old e-mail log-in.

31:29.208 --> 31:30.818
I used that account
as a tip line

31:30.906 --> 31:33.822
back when I first got started
in investigative reporting.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.505
Haven't accessed it
in 15 years.

31:37.593 --> 31:39.622
What was your connection
to Ellen Wallace?

31:41.689 --> 31:43.232
Ellen?

31:44.670 --> 31:46.075
What's this all about?

31:46.163 --> 31:47.599
You first.

31:50.525 --> 31:53.450
Ellen and I worked together
on an investigation.

31:53.858 --> 31:55.164
Into what?

31:56.458 --> 31:59.455
A 1998 attack in Kosovo.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.833
Rebel soldiers were blamed
for the deaths

32:03.921 --> 32:05.583
of multiple civilians,

32:05.814 --> 32:08.904
but I found a Marine eyewitness

32:10.157 --> 32:12.818
who said it was the fault
of U.S. forces.

32:14.092 --> 32:16.599
Ellen was helping me

32:16.725 --> 32:19.169
track down my source
after he went MIA.

32:19.257 --> 32:21.818
Investigating Marines
wasn't part of her job.

32:21.920 --> 32:25.054
Her interest in the case
was personal.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.089
The Marine
who commanded

32:27.177 --> 32:29.654
the U.S. forces in Kosovo was.

32:30.529 --> 32:32.685
General James Wallace.

32:34.979 --> 32:38.646
Wait. She was digging up dirt
on her own father?

32:39.411 --> 32:41.474
Ellen was determined

32:41.571 --> 32:43.029
to know the truth.

32:45.940 --> 32:49.596
Even if that meant exposing
the general as a war criminal.

33:00.888 --> 33:03.167
You're not insinuating
that the general

33:03.255 --> 33:05.958
had something to do
with his own daughter's death?

33:06.091 --> 33:07.982
I'm not here to enroll.

33:09.941 --> 33:12.027
I'm not gonna stand here
and let him disrespect...

33:12.115 --> 33:13.945
Daniel, give us
the room.

33:14.032 --> 33:16.075
It's fine.
I'll handle this.

33:19.385 --> 33:20.833
Hmm.

33:21.747 --> 33:25.083
You always were as subtle
as a freight train, Gibbs.

33:25.391 --> 33:27.818
Kosovo. 1998.

33:28.263 --> 33:30.333
Multiple civilian
casualties.

33:30.794 --> 33:32.224
I'm familiar with the incident.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.646
Were U.S. forces
responsible?

33:34.880 --> 33:36.589
I never would've given
an order like that,

33:36.677 --> 33:38.777
and if I had, I wouldn't
have lied about it.

33:38.865 --> 33:40.763
That's not what I asked,
General.

33:40.895 --> 33:42.059
At first, I brushed off

33:42.147 --> 33:44.715
those rumors
as baseless chatter,

33:44.802 --> 33:48.196
but when that reporter told me
the Marine eyewitness account,

33:48.283 --> 33:50.943
I began to suspect
there was more to it.

33:51.379 --> 33:54.599
You asked Ellen
to investigate what happened.

33:55.115 --> 33:56.646
She was the only one
I could trust.

33:56.810 --> 33:58.308
If my Marines
were involved,

33:58.396 --> 33:59.436
I wanted to know the truth,

33:59.523 --> 34:02.411
not some redacted statement
from the White House.

34:03.255 --> 34:05.213
I never would've
gotten Ellen involved

34:05.300 --> 34:07.651
if I thought for a second
she'd be in any danger.

34:07.738 --> 34:10.065
It's been 18 years
since I saw her face,

34:10.154 --> 34:12.917
18 years since
I heard her voice,

34:13.004 --> 34:15.029
but the time doesn't matter.

34:16.050 --> 34:20.318
Losing a child, it's not a wound
that ever heals, is it?

34:21.920 --> 34:23.388
No.

34:25.638 --> 34:27.628
Even after you called off
the engagement,

34:27.716 --> 34:30.324
she never said
an ill word about you.

34:31.888 --> 34:34.474
I've always liked you,
Gibbs, but, um,

34:35.411 --> 34:37.357
you didn't deserve
my daughter.

34:39.841 --> 34:41.161
Agreed.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.947
Then give me an explanation

34:44.036 --> 34:46.050
because it all
never made any sense.

34:46.138 --> 34:48.458
I know you loved Ellen,

34:48.605 --> 34:51.904
so why did you cut and run
like you did?

34:53.310 --> 34:55.114
Because I loved her.

34:59.616 --> 35:01.763
And that never ends well.

35:12.269 --> 35:13.737
Yo, this is gonna
take forever.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.028
Hey, come on,
we're making progress.

35:15.115 --> 35:16.277
You know how long
it's gonna

35:16.365 --> 35:19.862
take to go through
18,000 Pentagon employees?

35:19.950 --> 35:21.289
Nope, not all,

35:21.376 --> 35:24.728
just the 8,233 employees
that were in the building

35:24.815 --> 35:27.357
the evening of September 10th
up to the next morning.

35:27.445 --> 35:30.186
So take that defeatist energy
somewhere else.

35:30.274 --> 35:31.755
Not defeatist,
it's realistic.

35:31.843 --> 35:34.644
Uh, well, maybe you'd have
a more optimistic disposition

35:34.732 --> 35:36.261
if you expanded
your wardrobe palette

35:36.348 --> 35:37.958
beyond the colors of black,

35:38.045 --> 35:39.700
distressed black,
and gray-black.

35:39.788 --> 35:41.372
Hey, you don't tweak
a Picasso.

35:42.802 --> 35:44.095
I am sorry,

35:44.182 --> 35:46.489
did you just compare yourself
to a work of art?

35:46.583 --> 35:49.161
Yes. Yes, I did.

35:49.721 --> 35:52.568
Uh, hold on one second,
I know this name.

35:52.656 --> 35:56.388
Can you look up the service
record for Daniel Kent,

35:56.629 --> 35:58.146
8340.

35:58.864 --> 36:00.888
Brigadier
General Kent,

36:00.976 --> 36:03.239
the current commandant
at the Academy.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.633
In 2001 he worked

36:04.730 --> 36:06.955
as a military aide
to General James Wallace.

36:07.043 --> 36:09.772
- Prior to 2001?
- Uh, in 1998, Kent served

36:09.860 --> 36:11.885
in Kosovo,
in the unit

36:11.973 --> 36:13.453
Ellen Wallace was
investigating.

36:13.535 --> 36:14.840
Ooh, now we're talking.

36:14.928 --> 36:18.260
Security says he scanned
into the Pentagon

36:18.348 --> 36:21.463
at 2330 hours
on September 10th,

36:21.567 --> 36:24.830
then scanned out
at 0239 hours on 9/11.

36:24.918 --> 36:27.117
That's enough time
to kill Ellen,

36:27.205 --> 36:28.909
remove her body from
the building, and bury her.

36:28.996 --> 36:31.738
Yeah, well, I'm about
to complete the clue trifecta.

36:31.834 --> 36:33.113
According to his
old pay stubs,

36:33.201 --> 36:35.683
in 2001, Kent lived
in a building

36:35.771 --> 36:38.121
two blocks from where
Ellen's body was buried.

36:38.371 --> 36:40.777
How's my disposition
now, baby?

36:44.496 --> 36:47.136
I hope you are both
enjoying this

36:47.272 --> 36:48.893
because I'm gonna have
both of your badges

36:48.980 --> 36:50.285
by the end of the day.

36:50.373 --> 36:52.714
Then I guess we better
hurry, right, McGee?

36:53.043 --> 36:54.785
Yeah, where should
we start?

36:55.091 --> 36:57.703
Well, he seems
like a smart guy,

36:57.791 --> 37:00.761
so I say we, uh, we just
lay out what we think happened

37:00.849 --> 37:02.387
between him and Ellen Wallace
that night.

37:02.474 --> 37:03.886
Hypothetically speaking,
of course.

37:03.974 --> 37:07.020
- Stop us if we go too fast for you.
- Kosovo, 1998,

37:07.108 --> 37:10.024
you and a few Marines mistakenly
kill civilians during a raid.

37:10.112 --> 37:12.277
Which you then covered up
from your chain of command.

37:12.365 --> 37:15.020
You thought you were in the
clear, until you caught wind

37:15.108 --> 37:16.551
that Ellen Wallace
was investigating it.

37:16.638 --> 37:19.162
You panic. You confront her
in her office,

37:19.250 --> 37:21.613
then you kill her and bury her
by your old apartment.

37:21.701 --> 37:23.703
All the evidence left
behind in the Pentagon

37:23.791 --> 37:26.222
was destroyed when the plane
struck the next morning.

37:26.310 --> 37:29.285
And you got to get away with
murder for the last 18 years.

37:31.714 --> 37:34.175
That is quite the tale,

37:34.998 --> 37:37.792
but all hypothetical,
as you said.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.550
You don't have any evidence,

37:40.078 --> 37:42.168
and I haven't confessed
to anything.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.761
Nope, not yet.

37:47.954 --> 37:49.303
He's all yours, boss.

38:30.348 --> 38:32.629
As predicted, Kent caved.

38:32.717 --> 38:36.135
Yup, Gibbs only took
five minutes and a few sentences

38:36.223 --> 38:38.089
before he got Kent to admit
to killing Ellen.

38:38.177 --> 38:39.657
The man's a master.

38:39.745 --> 38:41.443
Good news, good news!

38:41.531 --> 38:44.261
I bring you all good news!

38:44.349 --> 38:47.511
All right, Jimmy,
nothing's ever that good.

38:47.707 --> 38:48.831
Oh, yeah?

38:49.098 --> 38:53.456
How about, uh, six all-access
passes to Comic-Con?

38:53.544 --> 38:55.620
- Who is the man?
- Seriously?

38:55.708 --> 38:57.393
Who? What?
When? How?

38:57.481 --> 38:58.839
Let's just say
I'm friends with

38:58.927 --> 39:00.632
a certain relative
of Stan Lee,

39:00.720 --> 39:03.206
and she was kind enough
to give us the hookup.

39:03.294 --> 39:05.159
Jimmy, we owe you
big time, man.

39:05.263 --> 39:09.042
This July, the four of us,
plus Breena and Delilah,

39:09.130 --> 39:12.640
are gonna be fully immersed
in the comic, science-fiction,

39:12.735 --> 39:14.472
fantasy experience.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.136
Oh, yeah, so I have
plans that day.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.617
Oh, come on,
what plans?

39:18.705 --> 39:19.784
Not sure yet.

39:19.872 --> 39:22.167
So how 'bout,
uh, how 'bout Gibbs?

39:22.255 --> 39:24.753
You think that maybe he'd want
to be our sixth, or...?

39:24.841 --> 39:27.214
Yeah, Gibbs in cosplay,
that's-that's an image.

39:27.302 --> 39:29.589
Yeah. Uh, Gibbs
with pointy ears.

39:29.677 --> 39:30.925
I don't think that's his scene.

39:31.013 --> 39:35.581
Don't be too sure.
With Gibbs, you never know.

40:13.855 --> 40:15.457
You following me?

40:16.544 --> 40:18.215
I knew
you'd be here.

40:55.589 --> 40:58.325
I was trying to do the
right thing for her...

41:04.152 --> 41:06.459
...but she still
ended up here.

41:17.994 --> 41:20.317
I regret that choice.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.481
A few more steps, boss.
