01:47.973 --> 01:49.500
You're special.

01:50.724 --> 01:54.204
You have a very special
purpose in life.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.827
You've been chosen.

02:08.803 --> 02:11.170
The Island awaits you.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.982
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:28.894 --> 03:30.781
Good morning, Tower One.

03:30.846 --> 03:34.293
Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.

03:34.366 --> 03:35.795
Sunny and mild.

03:46.461 --> 03:48.370
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

03:51.772 --> 03:54.554
And when you get a chance,
I'd like another color.

04:04.988 --> 04:07.355
- Morning.
- Good morning.

04:15.003 --> 04:18.100
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

04:28.090 --> 04:30.773
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

04:31.962 --> 04:33.489
Thank you.

04:34.586 --> 04:36.342
We're full.

04:39.386 --> 04:42.899
Good morning.
July 19th, 2019.

04:42.970 --> 04:45.141
Another day in paradise.

04:58.456 --> 05:00.595
Starkweather Two Delta,

05:00.665 --> 05:01.974
your time has come.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.887
You're moving out to the Island.

05:04.952 --> 05:06.839
Starkweather Two Delta here.

05:06.904 --> 05:10.165
And, as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.

05:10.231 --> 05:12.849
I've only been with you guys
for, like, six months,

05:12.919 --> 05:14.610
but I won the lottery.

05:14.679 --> 05:17.199
- That's right, me, Starkweather, OK?
- Six months.

05:17.271 --> 05:21.581
To go out and breathe fresh air,
swim in the ocean...

05:21.687 --> 05:25.648
I can't believe I won.
You call me Mr. Popular, I know.

05:25.751 --> 05:28.303
It's me. It's me.

05:28.374 --> 05:32.814
You guys know I'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.

05:33.622 --> 05:36.207
I'm going to the Island!
We're gonna have so much fun!

05:36.278 --> 05:40.053
But I need to see you guys out there.
You can do it! I won!

05:40.118 --> 05:41.362
That was this week's...

05:41.430 --> 05:43.885
We got a disturbance
on elevator 12, plaza level.

05:43.958 --> 05:47.536
...just moments before his
final departure to the Island,

05:47.606 --> 05:50.540
nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.

05:50.613 --> 05:52.752
- Lucky guy, huh?
- You can be a winner too.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.788
The next lottery is tonight.

05:57.077 --> 06:00.589
The next lottery is tonight.

06:02.772 --> 06:05.521
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

06:06.709 --> 06:09.010
- What about you?
- Three.

06:09.076 --> 06:10.986
Three. I've been here seven.

06:11.059 --> 06:15.150
If I do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.245
I'm such a loser.

06:47.793 --> 06:50.030
Sir.

06:50.098 --> 06:52.007
Yeah, you.

06:53.937 --> 06:55.431
Swipe.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.263
Gandu Three Echo, you've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

07:00.368 --> 07:03.216
Yes, I had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

07:03.281 --> 07:05.768
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.706
- I'm feeling much better.
- Well, then, have a pleasant day.

07:09.776 --> 07:12.525
Thank you, you too.
You both have a pleasant day too.

07:34.543 --> 07:35.949
Feel the stretch.

07:37.550 --> 07:38.794
One more breath in.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.360
But I was in that section.

07:56.429 --> 07:57.956
No, I don't understand!

07:58.029 --> 08:00.549
- I tried! I tried to do the best I...
- Listen to me!

08:01.548 --> 08:06.283
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

08:06.381 --> 08:10.025
A healthy person is a happy person.

08:16.492 --> 08:20.234
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.728
No bacon today?

08:21.804 --> 08:23.909
You got a nutrition flag,
means no bacon.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.401
In that case, two eggs,
over easy, not too runny,

08:26.475 --> 08:27.849
and a side of sausages.

08:27.915 --> 08:30.632
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

08:31.371 --> 08:34.948
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.871
Now, what's it gonna be?

08:36.938 --> 08:37.953
Move it.

08:40.714 --> 08:41.957
Surprise me.

08:47.434 --> 08:48.448
Surprise.

08:49.994 --> 08:52.547
Yummy. Next.

09:03.881 --> 09:06.532
Watch and learn.

09:07.432 --> 09:09.025
Next.

09:09.129 --> 09:11.463
Jordan Two Delta.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.022
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

09:13.128 --> 09:16.477
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

09:16.552 --> 09:19.301
- Eggs, please.
- OK.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.586
So, where were you the other day?
We missed you.

09:24.263 --> 09:27.198
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

09:27.847 --> 09:29.407
Get you anything else?

09:30.375 --> 09:31.585
Maybe a little bacon.

09:32.199 --> 09:34.141
No, it says I shouldn't.

09:34.215 --> 09:37.792
- Go ahead.
- Four, five pieces, please.

09:39.462 --> 09:40.706
Thank you.

09:42.406 --> 09:44.315
Well, good luck.
Gotta run along now.

09:44.422 --> 09:47.520
You're not going.
You gotta stay for dinner.

09:47.590 --> 09:50.143
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.800
- Back on your diet?
- You kidding? I love this stuff.

09:52.870 --> 09:55.520
Better eat up.
You'll need all your strength tonight.

09:55.589 --> 09:56.734
Is that a challenge?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.325
I promise I'll go easy on you.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.898
Please separate.
Find your seats now.

10:04.965 --> 10:06.820
Yeah.

10:07.653 --> 10:12.290
"'Who wants Sally? ' said Dick.
'I do,' said Jane.

10:12.356 --> 10:15.039
'I cannot find Sally.

10:15.108 --> 10:19.615
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.

10:19.684 --> 10:22.171
Is Sally here?"'

10:33.923 --> 10:36.542
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

10:40.802 --> 10:43.519
What'd you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

10:46.786 --> 10:48.957
Sir?

10:49.026 --> 10:53.631
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please.

11:01.441 --> 11:03.808
Please, sit down.

11:04.577 --> 11:07.130
So, how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

11:07.201 --> 11:09.656
Not so good, I guess.

11:09.729 --> 11:11.638
Why do you say that?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.396
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

11:14.496 --> 11:17.365
That's a rather negative association.

11:17.473 --> 11:21.695
My only job is to see that you're happy,
things are OK with you.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.287
Right.

11:26.368 --> 11:29.303
Your file shows that you've
been interacting regularly

11:29.376 --> 11:30.619
with Jordan Two Delta.

11:30.687 --> 11:34.462
- There's no law against friendship.
- No. No, we encourage it,

11:34.527 --> 11:38.750
but, obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

11:38.815 --> 11:40.702
I know the rules of proximity.

11:42.942 --> 11:45.495
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

11:45.599 --> 11:48.468
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.957
But screening has picked up
some trace levels,

11:52.062 --> 11:55.990
changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

11:56.062 --> 11:58.745
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

11:58.813 --> 12:01.301
Why don't you tell me
about your dream?

12:01.982 --> 12:06.204
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to the Island.

12:06.269 --> 12:09.400
A boat? What kind of boat?

12:10.877 --> 12:12.154
A nice boat.

12:12.221 --> 12:13.715
Draw it for me, would you?

12:19.005 --> 12:22.300
So, you are heading
toward the Island.

12:22.364 --> 12:24.273
What happens then?

12:24.380 --> 12:27.097
- I drown.
- Really?

12:28.028 --> 12:30.962
- Why do you think that is?
- I don't know. You tell me.

12:31.036 --> 12:33.938
- Maybe you're afraid of winning.
- Why would I be afraid?

12:34.012 --> 12:35.800
You tell me.

12:40.347 --> 12:42.616
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

12:44.730 --> 12:46.519
Well, it's...

12:46.587 --> 12:48.659
It's just...

12:49.434 --> 12:51.605
All right.
Tuesday night is tofu night.

12:51.706 --> 12:54.870
And I'm asking myself, who decided
that everyone here likes tofu

12:54.938 --> 12:57.425
in the first place?
And what is tofu, anyway?

12:57.498 --> 13:00.564
And why can't I have bacon?
I line up every morning,

13:00.634 --> 13:03.449
and I'm not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast.

13:03.514 --> 13:05.586
And...
Let's talk about all the white.

13:05.657 --> 13:07.762
Why is everyone
wearing white all the time?

13:07.833 --> 13:11.346
It's impossible to keep clean.
I always get the gray stripe.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.002
I never get any color.
And I hand it in to be cleaned,

13:14.073 --> 13:17.968
and someone cleans it, and folds it
neatly back in my drawer, but who?

13:18.040 --> 13:20.790
Who is that person? I don't know.

13:20.889 --> 13:22.514
I just... I wanna know answers.

13:22.617 --> 13:25.235
And I wish that there was more.

13:26.392 --> 13:28.181
- More?
- Yeah.

13:28.248 --> 13:32.371
More than just waiting
to go to the Island.

13:35.063 --> 13:37.300
Lincoln,

13:37.368 --> 13:40.084
it's your nature
to question things.

13:40.152 --> 13:44.821
But don't you realize how lucky you are?
That you survived the contamination.

13:44.887 --> 13:48.913
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

13:48.983 --> 13:52.081
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

13:55.798 --> 13:59.595
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to the Island too?

13:59.702 --> 14:02.004
No.

14:02.070 --> 14:05.168
My responsibility is to make sure

14:05.238 --> 14:07.441
this facility continues to operate.

14:07.509 --> 14:12.910
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

14:12.981 --> 14:15.534
...we can't win the lottery.

14:18.452 --> 14:20.208
Let me see that.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.985
You draw well.

14:24.053 --> 14:26.900
"Renovatio."
What does that mean?

14:26.964 --> 14:29.135
I don't know.
It's always in my dream.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.747
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

14:34.516 --> 14:35.890
What sort of tests?

14:36.724 --> 14:39.179
Nice tests.

14:39.252 --> 14:40.528
Come with me.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.038
Take a seat.

14:53.842 --> 14:55.850
OK, let's get you comfortable.

14:55.922 --> 14:57.351
Swing back.

15:01.906 --> 15:05.201
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

15:05.266 --> 15:07.371
Totally harmless.

15:07.442 --> 15:10.289
Don't worry, it's painless.

15:30.384 --> 15:31.846
- It hurts.
- Not really.

15:31.952 --> 15:33.578
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

15:33.679 --> 15:35.883
Yeah, it really, really does!

15:40.815 --> 15:43.881
The micro-sensors
will move along your optic nerve.

15:43.951 --> 15:47.147
They'll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours,

15:47.215 --> 15:49.801
after which,
you'll pass them through your urine.

15:49.871 --> 15:51.911
Now, that might hurt.

16:02.798 --> 16:04.391
Six Echo, you're late.

16:18.637 --> 16:20.547
Jones, you ever get bored doing this?

16:20.621 --> 16:21.798
- Doing what?
- This.

16:21.869 --> 16:24.738
- I never really thought about it.
- I think about it a lot.

16:24.812 --> 16:26.700
- About what?
- This boring job.

16:26.765 --> 16:29.798
- What are we doing here?
- We're feeding the nutrient lines.

16:29.868 --> 16:33.348
We eat food, food's gotta have
vitamins, right? It's good for us.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.972
You don't ever wonder about anything?

16:36.075 --> 16:38.442
Where do these tubes go?

16:39.628 --> 16:41.002
They start there.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.883
And they go... right there.

16:45.068 --> 16:47.850
Hey. Did you get a look
at the new guy?

16:47.915 --> 16:49.890
Seven Foxtrot.

16:49.963 --> 16:53.575
They found another survivor.
They keep finding them.

16:53.643 --> 16:55.236
He'll probably win the lottery.

16:55.307 --> 16:58.438
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go, you try it.

16:58.507 --> 17:01.671
Straight down in the hole.

17:01.739 --> 17:05.415
In the hole.
No, no, no. Put it down.

17:05.513 --> 17:08.776
Did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination?

17:08.842 --> 17:13.184
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-The-Questions,
let me ask you this:

17:13.962 --> 17:16.067
Lottery's supposed
to be random, right?

17:16.137 --> 17:17.185
Right.

17:17.257 --> 17:19.492
What if it's not?
What if it's rigged?

17:20.201 --> 17:21.313
Rigged?

17:22.729 --> 17:24.736
I've been working on this. Here.

17:24.809 --> 17:26.718
Take a look at that.

17:27.367 --> 17:30.270
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the Island.

17:30.344 --> 17:33.508
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

17:33.576 --> 17:36.390
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.455
I assigned it a point value system,
based on the alphabet,

17:39.560 --> 17:41.894
like the last guy,
Starkweather, S equals 15.

17:41.959 --> 17:43.552
Q equals 15, S equals 19.

17:43.624 --> 17:45.631
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- No.

17:45.703 --> 17:49.052
Well, maybe if you would listen to me,
I'm trying to tell you.

17:49.128 --> 17:52.389
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

17:52.455 --> 17:55.717
You multiply... You divide it by
the amount of... You divide it...

17:55.783 --> 18:00.093
You divide it by the amount of people,
which is 25, a thousand plus five, 2500.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.778
You know what that spells?
J-O-N-E-S.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.328
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

18:08.710 --> 18:10.117
- No.
- Gentlemen,

18:11.013 --> 18:13.468
I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

18:13.574 --> 18:15.581
There you go. Straight.

18:15.686 --> 18:17.857
Straight down in the hole.

18:17.926 --> 18:19.714
- There you go.
- Straight...

18:21.605 --> 18:23.710
- What? He had something on his... OK.
- Go.

18:28.837 --> 18:30.528
Lima! Are you OK?
What's wrong?

18:30.597 --> 18:34.077
Code 15, we need med-techs stat!
Lima One Alpha.

18:34.148 --> 18:35.806
Let's give her some air, OK?

18:35.876 --> 18:38.396
You're gonna be OK, all right?
Relax and breathe.

18:38.468 --> 18:40.988
Can I get a wheelchair?
It's for Lima One Alpha.

18:41.092 --> 18:44.408
- You OK?
- I think it's time.

18:46.404 --> 18:49.720
Lima, you're going to the Island.

18:49.827 --> 18:52.674
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.562
I hope I see you soon.

18:57.123 --> 19:01.792
Everyone, please follow her out.
Quickly and carefully. Watch the glass.

19:01.859 --> 19:03.898
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

19:08.099 --> 19:10.433
That's fair. That's real fair.

19:10.498 --> 19:13.814
Ladies, ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen. Thank you.

19:17.474 --> 19:19.710
Everyone, back to work.

19:19.777 --> 19:21.664
That is so not fair.

19:22.369 --> 19:26.362
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.408
Tech Services.

19:28.481 --> 19:30.204
Computer's down again.

19:31.073 --> 19:33.015
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.350
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-Key. Contamination kit.

19:36.416 --> 19:38.424
- Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

20:05.854 --> 20:08.723
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

20:09.887 --> 20:13.563
Hey, chief. We got live wires
all over the place here.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.728
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

20:17.373 --> 20:18.900
- What?
- I've been looking...

20:19.006 --> 20:21.788
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

20:21.854 --> 20:26.076
If you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.352
How you doing, Mac?

20:27.997 --> 20:30.517
- What are you doing here?
- My chip fried again.

20:30.589 --> 20:33.404
Yeah. How much longer
do you think that one's gonna work?

20:35.612 --> 20:38.579
- What are you two clowns looking at?
- Hey,

20:38.652 --> 20:40.627
you got any of that stuff
on you today?

20:41.309 --> 20:43.927
Oh, look, it's break time.
Come on.

20:45.468 --> 20:48.315
You're a bad influence on me.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.195
Must be why I like you so much.

20:54.619 --> 20:57.968
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

20:59.003 --> 21:02.483
It's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

21:05.691 --> 21:08.560
I like coming out here, talking.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.188
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

21:11.259 --> 21:12.338
Yeah.

21:13.914 --> 21:15.823
Step into my office.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.825
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

21:24.889 --> 21:26.744
Where are their clothes?

21:26.809 --> 21:28.053
What's with Dr. Merrick?

21:28.121 --> 21:32.594
You mean why does he act like he's
got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

21:32.665 --> 21:33.712
Yeah.

21:33.785 --> 21:35.989
It's called a God complex.

21:36.057 --> 21:38.991
All doctors are like that.
They think they know everything.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.104
What's God?

21:41.177 --> 21:43.632
Well, you know when you
want something really bad

21:43.705 --> 21:45.810
and you close your eyes
and you wish for it?

21:45.881 --> 21:49.939
- God's the guy that ignores you.
- Oh. Right.

21:50.008 --> 21:52.561
Tech Service requested
in Product Extraction.

21:52.663 --> 21:54.736
Yeah, I'll be right there.

21:58.071 --> 22:00.820
Oh, hey. Let me get that.

22:00.888 --> 22:03.670
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

22:03.735 --> 22:06.418
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

22:06.487 --> 22:08.494
You mean from
before the contamination?

22:08.567 --> 22:11.666
Yeah. Come on, you're killing me
with questions here.

22:11.735 --> 22:13.491
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

22:13.559 --> 22:16.788
Because you're,
you know, like, special.

22:16.854 --> 22:18.577
Why? Why am I special?

22:18.646 --> 22:20.206
There's another question.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.058
You remember what we talked about?

22:23.125 --> 22:25.580
You don't tell anybody
about our conversations?

22:25.686 --> 22:28.784
- 'Cause that can get me in big trouble.
- No, I don't.

22:28.885 --> 22:30.292
Good.

23:06.227 --> 23:07.950
How's it going?

23:10.355 --> 23:13.388
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

23:14.066 --> 23:16.106
OK, I'll catch you later.

23:19.986 --> 23:21.928
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

23:22.002 --> 23:23.344
Yep.

23:23.410 --> 23:25.264
What a surprise.

23:27.601 --> 23:28.943
Go hot.

23:33.073 --> 23:35.921
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

23:36.497 --> 23:38.831
You'd think with the money
this place rakes in

23:38.897 --> 23:41.264
- they could afford decent equipment.
- Yeah.

23:42.609 --> 23:43.819
Ready?

23:45.776 --> 23:47.238
Cut the O2.

23:49.232 --> 23:53.007
Seriously, unless you want to see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

23:53.072 --> 23:55.079
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

24:17.006 --> 24:18.697
Breathe.

24:20.238 --> 24:22.147
Come on, yeah. That's it.

24:25.358 --> 24:27.878
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

24:27.950 --> 24:29.128
Come on.

24:30.253 --> 24:32.937
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

24:33.037 --> 24:35.306
There we go.
Now we're working.

24:35.373 --> 24:37.129
He's healthy.

24:39.053 --> 24:40.679
Welcome to the world.

24:44.236 --> 24:46.244
So, how's Three Helo?

24:46.316 --> 24:47.723
Good.

24:49.773 --> 24:51.528
He's feisty. Light.

24:53.260 --> 24:55.911
Vitals seem fine.

24:56.748 --> 24:59.563
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.485
Looks like we have a fine product.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.726
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

26:20.742 --> 26:22.400
Little bug.

27:07.683 --> 27:10.717
Maybe next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

27:17.987 --> 27:19.929
It was very sad.

27:20.515 --> 27:21.725
- Hey.
- Hello.

27:21.795 --> 27:23.518
Hi.

27:24.866 --> 27:27.714
So you just let
a little girl beat you, huh?

27:29.283 --> 27:30.941
Stim units restricted.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.952
Yeah, yeah.
I'll have the veggie stuff.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.743
Papassian petal juice, please.

27:35.809 --> 27:37.435
It's good for the skin.

27:49.217 --> 27:50.624
Jordan, are you sick?

27:52.032 --> 27:56.309
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.010
No, I'm fine.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.247
OK.

28:00.865 --> 28:02.687
How are you?

28:02.752 --> 28:04.759
I'm fine.

28:04.832 --> 28:06.654
Lincoln, I can tell when you're lying

28:06.720 --> 28:09.851
'cause your mouth smiles
but your eyes don't.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.270
I found something.

28:13.344 --> 28:14.554
- What?
- A bug.

28:15.135 --> 28:16.793
- A bug?
- A flying bug.

28:16.895 --> 28:17.822
Can I see it?

28:17.919 --> 28:19.959
I think it came
in the ventilation shaft.

28:20.063 --> 28:22.649
I thought they went extinct
with the contamination.

28:22.719 --> 28:25.174
I know. And how did it get by
the pathogen sensors?

28:25.247 --> 28:27.734
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

28:27.806 --> 28:30.937
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

28:31.006 --> 28:33.756
They keep finding people,
but where do they come from?

28:33.822 --> 28:36.822
It's good that they find survivors.

28:36.893 --> 28:40.570
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

28:40.637 --> 28:43.158
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

28:44.094 --> 28:46.362
Good things do happen.

28:46.430 --> 28:48.601
I want to see that bug.

28:50.045 --> 28:52.914
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

28:53.021 --> 28:55.060
- What?
- "Dude."

28:55.165 --> 28:56.507
"Dude"?

28:56.573 --> 28:58.744
- What does it mean?
- He just called me dude.

28:58.813 --> 29:00.820
- Hey, dude.
- He said "Hey, dude"?

29:00.892 --> 29:02.714
- D-O-O-D. "Dude."
- Hey, dude.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.438
- Dude.
- Dude.

29:04.508 --> 29:06.963
- Lottery's gonna start.
- Like you stand a chance.

29:07.036 --> 29:07.985
Dude.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.671
Light up all etherscreens.

29:11.740 --> 29:14.871
And... start the lottery.

29:22.363 --> 29:23.540
Good evening.

29:23.643 --> 29:27.636
Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.

29:28.603 --> 29:30.457
It's been a busy week.

29:30.523 --> 29:33.457
We've had a record two winners so far.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.661
Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation

29:36.730 --> 29:40.886
to the Island, transported
to the world's last paradise.

29:40.953 --> 29:44.117
- And start the spin.
- And now, let the spin begin.

29:49.145 --> 29:52.243
Jordan Two Delta, step up.

29:52.345 --> 29:57.047
Your time has come.
You're moving out to the Island.

30:02.296 --> 30:06.093
For everyone else, never lose hope.

30:08.664 --> 30:10.486
Thank you. Thank you.

30:10.552 --> 30:13.203
I can't believe it.

30:20.695 --> 30:23.030
I have to go in the morning.

30:23.095 --> 30:25.004
You were right.

30:26.519 --> 30:29.039
Good things do happen.

30:32.823 --> 30:35.539
I wish I'd known you better.

30:36.727 --> 30:38.319
You two.

30:38.390 --> 30:39.765
Watch your proximity.

30:48.149 --> 30:50.320
I'll see you on the Island.

31:07.541 --> 31:10.889
You want to go to the Island.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.976
Breathe!

31:18.388 --> 31:19.882
You've been chosen.

31:21.907 --> 31:24.874
The Island awaits you.

32:39.854 --> 32:43.683
Check into the nurses' station
up the corridor, take your first left.

32:44.974 --> 32:47.494
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.705
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

33:49.994 --> 33:52.132
She's so beautiful.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.392
I've never seen a baby.

33:55.466 --> 33:56.775
Can I hold her?

33:56.842 --> 33:58.303
Notjust yet.

34:04.425 --> 34:06.792
Are we going to the Island?

35:21.284 --> 35:23.193
Oh, my God.

35:23.748 --> 35:26.052
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

35:26.052 --> 35:27.840
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

35:27.907 --> 35:29.795
It's my baby. Oh, my gosh.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.070
Whenever you're ready,

35:31.139 --> 35:34.717
we have copies of your
policy termination for your records.

35:34.787 --> 35:37.405
Look at her. She's beautiful.

35:39.651 --> 35:43.295
Starkweather? That big, cute football
player on the Reebok commercials?

35:43.362 --> 35:46.013
I love him! Is he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

35:46.115 --> 35:47.675
I just love him!

35:48.355 --> 35:50.744
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.705
Any chance I can make this pickup?

35:52.770 --> 35:54.974
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

35:55.042 --> 35:59.165
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

35:59.233 --> 36:02.397
We don't fly in bad weather.

36:05.825 --> 36:08.411
They look real busy.
So I'd have a seat.

36:09.409 --> 36:11.798
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

36:11.873 --> 36:16.793
Heart rate 102.
BP 126 over 82.

36:16.897 --> 36:18.806
- Laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

36:18.913 --> 36:21.760
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

36:21.856 --> 36:23.678
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

36:23.744 --> 36:24.889
Prepare that bone saw.

36:26.816 --> 36:29.303
I think we're about ready to open.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.249
Let's clean that drip.

36:52.798 --> 36:54.653
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

36:56.478 --> 37:00.700
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

37:03.965 --> 37:06.780
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP 138 over 92.

37:09.053 --> 37:10.940
Heart rate's still rising.

37:11.005 --> 37:14.071
- Boost the anesthetic level!
- He's fighting the ventilator.

37:14.141 --> 37:16.563
I don't wanna euthanize this guy
to get his liver!

37:24.764 --> 37:25.876
Guards!

37:27.324 --> 37:29.146
Oh, my God!

37:36.091 --> 37:38.841
Stop that man! Get him!

37:45.114 --> 37:47.089
Stop!

38:03.001 --> 38:05.008
All right, relax, relax, big guy.
Relax.

38:05.081 --> 38:07.088
Easy, easy, easy!
Don't damage him!

38:10.522 --> 38:11.983
- Relax!
- No!

38:12.057 --> 38:14.478
I don't want to die, no! No!

38:14.553 --> 38:18.262
I want to go to the Island!
You promised!

38:18.329 --> 38:21.624
I wanna live!
I don't wanna die!

38:21.689 --> 38:23.216
No!

38:25.432 --> 38:26.839
Hey.

38:27.576 --> 38:30.991
You OK, buddy? It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

38:31.096 --> 38:34.063
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

38:44.951 --> 38:46.609
Check this part out.

38:46.679 --> 38:48.621
Wait, OK, watch.
Wait, wait.

38:48.695 --> 38:52.273
Boom! Did you see that? Man.

38:52.343 --> 38:54.798
That is so cruel, man.

38:55.543 --> 38:58.161
Oh, man. Down for the count.

38:58.262 --> 39:02.419
Gentlemen, I understand
there's been an incident.

39:02.486 --> 39:05.355
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

39:05.462 --> 39:07.916
- And do you find that funny?
- No, sir.

39:07.989 --> 39:10.956
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

39:11.029 --> 39:13.134
Play it back, please.

39:17.941 --> 39:19.729
Stop.

39:19.796 --> 39:21.422
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.697
He was scared, I helped him up.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.058
Play it back at half-speed.

39:32.596 --> 39:34.189
Freeze.

39:35.348 --> 39:36.657
Magnify his wrist.

39:41.364 --> 39:43.152
We have a product on the loose.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.674
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

39:46.739 --> 39:49.160
- Let's go.
- OK, down to Level 2.

40:01.362 --> 40:03.533
You can't come in here!

40:08.626 --> 40:11.495
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

40:28.241 --> 40:30.150
- How sweet.
- You gotta come with me.

40:30.224 --> 40:31.172
What?

40:31.248 --> 40:33.353
Move! Move!

40:41.551 --> 40:44.398
We got a match!
Lincoln Six Echo.

40:44.464 --> 40:46.733
I want a full contamination lockdown.

40:46.799 --> 40:48.140
Find Six Echo.

40:50.575 --> 40:52.397
- Masks down.
- What the hell?!

40:52.463 --> 40:55.528
- I need to see all your faces.
- I don't care what he says, nurse,

40:55.598 --> 40:58.380
that's live human tissue.
Seal that liver now.

40:58.447 --> 41:00.072
Check the back corners!

41:04.078 --> 41:08.201
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

41:08.782 --> 41:10.308
Find out.

41:12.654 --> 41:15.174
- Men aren't supposed to be...
- You gotta trust me.

41:15.245 --> 41:16.193
- What?
- I saw them.

41:16.269 --> 41:18.473
- Who?
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.

41:18.541 --> 41:20.996
- What?
- They killed her and cut him open...

41:21.069 --> 41:22.956
Stop it!
I want to go back to my room.

41:23.020 --> 41:25.802
- They're gonna kill you.
- I'm going to the Island.

41:25.869 --> 41:27.941
Jordan, there is no Island!
Come on!

41:29.421 --> 41:32.039
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

41:32.109 --> 41:34.727
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

41:34.796 --> 41:37.130
Get out of the way!

41:37.228 --> 41:38.918
Move! Move!

41:39.020 --> 41:41.027
Out of the way!
Get out. Now.

41:41.740 --> 41:42.885
Just trust me.

41:46.987 --> 41:49.354
This is a community bulletin.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.077
Attention, residents,

41:51.147 --> 41:55.075
a contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.

41:55.147 --> 41:59.402
Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.

42:01.418 --> 42:03.839
Move! Move!

42:07.594 --> 42:09.187
Freeze! Stop right there!

42:29.193 --> 42:30.469
Go! Go! Go!

42:30.536 --> 42:31.584
Get out of the way!

42:40.296 --> 42:43.874
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

42:57.063 --> 42:59.037
There they are!

42:59.111 --> 43:03.486
I've got them in Sector Six basement!
Get them!

43:14.373 --> 43:16.195
- No!
- Stop!

43:26.405 --> 43:28.095
- Lincoln!
- Get up!

43:28.165 --> 43:29.147
No!

43:29.988 --> 43:31.549
Stop it!

43:33.253 --> 43:34.529
No!

44:10.722 --> 44:15.293
You've been chosen.
You have a very special purpose.

44:15.362 --> 44:18.842
You're part of a new beginning.
You're special.

44:18.945 --> 44:21.912
You have a very special purpose.

44:26.241 --> 44:29.088
You want to go to the Island.
Your purpose in life

44:29.153 --> 44:32.000
is to populate the Island.
You're part of a new beginning.

44:32.065 --> 44:35.709
You're special. Very special.
You've been chosen.

44:35.776 --> 44:38.646
You've been chosen.
Chosen to survive, to carry on.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.015
You want to go to the Island.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.212
- Go, go!
- You have a very special purpose.

44:52.832 --> 44:54.970
Very special.

44:56.064 --> 44:57.951
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

44:58.015 --> 44:59.924
Check over here!

44:59.999 --> 45:01.308
Watch your left!

45:02.687 --> 45:03.832
Run!

45:06.654 --> 45:08.891
Go! Run!

45:08.959 --> 45:10.388
He's over here!

45:17.022 --> 45:19.094
There they are! Go!

45:32.349 --> 45:35.284
- Lincoln!
- Come on! Get him!

45:36.444 --> 45:38.899
- Let s go. Move!
- Come on!

45:41.212 --> 45:42.357
Come on! Come on!

45:42.428 --> 45:44.948
Damn! Go, go! Go!

45:45.020 --> 45:46.613
Come on, let's go!

45:49.948 --> 45:52.053
You still think there's an Island?

46:02.555 --> 46:03.864
Come on!

46:28.345 --> 46:30.647
Come on. Come on!

46:47.192 --> 46:49.613
There's a door over here!

48:02.131 --> 48:06.801
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.

48:06.867 --> 48:11.984
Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on the Island.

48:12.051 --> 48:14.898
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

48:14.963 --> 48:18.508
Sir, I want to focus more than anything.
I love my job. It's interesting.

48:18.578 --> 48:21.578
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated,

48:21.651 --> 48:24.585
and it really worries me,
because he's a good friend of mine.

48:24.658 --> 48:27.025
He's one of my best friends.
My only best friend.

48:27.090 --> 48:29.130
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

48:29.202 --> 48:31.307
Sir, I have one question.

48:31.377 --> 48:33.417
Where do all the tubes go?

48:35.794 --> 48:37.616
The human organism.

48:37.681 --> 48:40.528
Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.

48:40.593 --> 48:43.408
The product of three billion years
of evolution.

48:43.473 --> 48:46.789
Perfect in every way, except one.

48:46.865 --> 48:49.254
Like all machines, it wears out.

48:50.897 --> 48:53.515
For centuries, the idea
of replenishing the human body

48:53.585 --> 48:55.624
has been
at the forefront of science.

48:55.696 --> 48:57.769
We need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.595
- How?
- A terrific day. By selling.

48:59.664 --> 49:02.565
By selling. Sell, sell, sell.
You start, I finish.

49:12.430 --> 49:14.219
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:14.287 --> 49:18.062
welcome to
the next generation of science,

49:18.127 --> 49:20.014
the agnate.

49:20.078 --> 49:24.039
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood

49:24.110 --> 49:25.833
to match the client's age.

49:25.902 --> 49:28.324
- You're looking at stage one
- This way, sir.

49:28.397 --> 49:29.739
In its development.

49:29.806 --> 49:32.359
Within 12 months
it will be harvest-ready,

49:32.430 --> 49:35.943
providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.

49:36.014 --> 49:40.007
All genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

49:40.109 --> 49:44.681
And, in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015,

49:44.749 --> 49:49.702
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

49:49.772 --> 49:52.074
They never achieve consciousness.

49:52.141 --> 49:55.239
They never think or suffer

49:55.308 --> 49:59.170
or feel pain, joy, love, hate.

49:59.244 --> 50:01.961
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen,

50:02.028 --> 50:04.679
in every way that matters,

50:04.748 --> 50:07.431
not human.

50:11.499 --> 50:14.466
This is our public relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

50:14.571 --> 50:16.579
He'll be happy
to answer any questions.

50:16.683 --> 50:19.050
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

50:19.147 --> 50:23.008
I want to talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

50:23.594 --> 50:27.489
And I want to tell you how you're
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.

50:31.370 --> 50:34.566
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

50:34.633 --> 50:38.211
You come highly recommended
by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

50:38.281 --> 50:40.998
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

50:41.065 --> 50:43.782
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

50:43.881 --> 50:46.531
I was formerly with the GIGN,
French Special Forces.

50:46.633 --> 50:48.804
I understand you had a corporate theft.

50:48.873 --> 50:51.207
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

50:51.272 --> 50:55.069
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

50:55.144 --> 50:58.144
We've had a... security breach.

50:58.216 --> 51:01.762
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

51:01.832 --> 51:04.319
Because their
investment here is sizeable.

51:04.391 --> 51:07.555
One hundred and twenty
billion dollars, to be exact.

51:07.623 --> 51:10.438
And I can't afford
for them to reconsider.

51:10.503 --> 51:12.674
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

51:12.743 --> 51:15.558
I am in the business
of keeping my clients' confidence.

51:15.655 --> 51:17.062
Good.

51:21.351 --> 51:23.587
Two of our products have escaped.

51:23.654 --> 51:26.524
Impressive,
considering they're vegetative.

51:26.598 --> 51:29.348
Well, after several years
of trial and error,

51:29.414 --> 51:31.683
we discovered that
without consciousness,

51:31.750 --> 51:36.965
without human experience,
emotion, without life,

51:37.029 --> 51:39.233
the organs failed.

51:40.806 --> 51:42.780
How long have they been missing?

51:42.853 --> 51:45.504
Four hours and 36 minutes.

51:45.573 --> 51:48.223
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

51:48.325 --> 51:52.034
Wade, 1.2 miles an hour,
five mile perimeter,

51:52.101 --> 51:55.068
- standby for suspect description.
- We're on it.

51:55.172 --> 51:56.546
Follow me.

52:12.740 --> 52:16.122
- Come on, we gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

52:16.195 --> 52:17.439
- You gotta try.
- Where?

52:17.507 --> 52:19.928
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

52:20.035 --> 52:22.685
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

52:28.099 --> 52:30.400
What if we are contaminated?

52:30.946 --> 52:32.953
Then we'd be dead.

52:33.698 --> 52:36.284
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

52:47.105 --> 52:49.854
- What is it?
- I don't know.

52:49.921 --> 52:51.514
But it's alive.

52:55.969 --> 52:58.838
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

52:58.944 --> 53:00.155
Let's rest in here.

53:00.225 --> 53:02.875
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor,
Sarah Jordan, is in a coma

53:02.944 --> 53:05.977
after a car accident.
She's in need of multiple transplants.

53:06.048 --> 53:07.707
How long does she have?

53:07.776 --> 53:10.142
Forty-eight hours.
Three days maximum.

53:10.208 --> 53:11.866
Tell me about Six Echo.

53:11.936 --> 53:15.197
He was really the first one
to question his environment,

53:15.263 --> 53:16.725
his whole existence here.

53:16.800 --> 53:20.825
Over the last few months,
he began demonstrating unstable behavior

53:20.895 --> 53:23.612
and I can't account for it.

53:23.711 --> 53:26.078
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

53:26.175 --> 53:28.476
What do they know
about the outside world?

53:28.542 --> 53:30.397
Very little.

53:30.462 --> 53:33.429
We control them with
the memory of a shared event.

53:33.502 --> 53:37.692
A global contamination.
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

53:37.758 --> 53:42.133
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope,

53:42.206 --> 53:44.148
gives them purpose.

53:44.669 --> 53:46.841
Everything we expose them to,

53:46.910 --> 53:50.390
their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play,

53:50.461 --> 53:53.941
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

53:54.013 --> 53:56.402
To avoid obvious complications,

53:56.509 --> 53:59.029
they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

53:59.133 --> 54:02.329
We find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether.

54:02.812 --> 54:07.929
In a very real sense...
they're like children.

54:07.996 --> 54:10.581
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

54:27.067 --> 54:30.296
- What was that?
- I don't know.

54:31.611 --> 54:33.269
But I want one.

54:47.290 --> 54:48.948
Look!

54:49.753 --> 54:52.917
Route 39. Route 39.

54:52.985 --> 54:54.895
Come on.

54:54.969 --> 54:57.042
I got it from a friend.

55:20.855 --> 55:22.797
I think that's it.

55:53.109 --> 55:54.189
What's up?

55:54.261 --> 55:56.814
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

55:58.389 --> 56:00.494
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

56:01.333 --> 56:04.977
- I am.
- And you would be who?

56:05.077 --> 56:08.011
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

56:09.268 --> 56:11.024
Right.

56:11.092 --> 56:13.842
Y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?

56:13.908 --> 56:16.875
- U... What? No, I don't think so.
- No.

56:16.948 --> 56:18.093
McCord?

56:18.164 --> 56:20.498
Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.
He's in the can.

56:20.563 --> 56:22.865
- He's in a can?
- Taking a dump.

56:22.932 --> 56:24.655
A dump? Taking it where?

56:27.187 --> 56:29.423
Bubba, you're fixing
to get on my nerves.

56:29.491 --> 56:32.590
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

56:32.659 --> 56:35.593
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

56:35.699 --> 56:38.568
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

56:38.674 --> 56:40.584
Straight up?

56:51.122 --> 56:53.358
Oh, that is bitchin'.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.260
So this is Sector Five?

56:57.329 --> 56:59.533
Hey! You son of a bitch!

57:01.233 --> 57:02.891
You knew!

57:02.961 --> 57:06.059
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

57:06.129 --> 57:07.885
They're gonna be looking for you.

57:07.985 --> 57:11.050
- Tell me what's going on!
- If anybody sees us together,

57:11.152 --> 57:13.159
both of us are gonna be dead.

57:13.264 --> 57:16.013
So, will you just
take your hands off me? Let me...

57:16.080 --> 57:20.204
Let me pull my pants up
and I'll take you back to my place

57:20.272 --> 57:21.995
so we can be alone. OK?

57:24.912 --> 57:28.207
- Ed.
- Mac.

57:29.072 --> 57:31.373
Give you... give you boys a minute?

57:32.783 --> 57:35.204
What?
This isn't what it looks like.

57:37.295 --> 57:39.400
Sure. Sure.

57:39.502 --> 57:41.325
Get out of here, you stupid...

57:41.391 --> 57:43.463
Will you stop?

57:44.846 --> 57:48.141
You can'tjust bust in on a guy
like that. That's really rude.

57:49.230 --> 57:51.685
She doesn't understand the licking.

57:51.757 --> 57:54.059
You a knucklehead?
You brought another one?

57:54.126 --> 57:56.100
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

57:56.173 --> 57:58.508
Back off, Joe, OK?
Don't push me!

57:58.574 --> 58:00.035
No, no, no, that's no good.

58:00.109 --> 58:01.570
Put it on my tab.
We gotta go.

58:01.645 --> 58:04.067
Friends from out of town.
Come on, sweetheart.

58:04.141 --> 58:05.896
- Give me your number.
- Two Delta.

58:05.965 --> 58:08.550
Hey, look. Get...
Don't test me.

58:08.621 --> 58:10.508
Don't.

58:21.836 --> 58:24.454
Well, this is nice.

58:27.179 --> 58:29.961
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

58:30.027 --> 58:32.329
Do y'all work with him?

58:33.419 --> 58:36.321
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

58:36.395 --> 58:38.696
Those are fancy tracksuits.

58:38.763 --> 58:42.341
Y'all exercise out in this heat,
gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.

58:43.275 --> 58:46.755
Oh, Mac, look.
They got matching bracelets.

58:46.858 --> 58:50.633
- We should do that, honey.
- Suzie...

58:50.698 --> 58:53.698
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

58:54.954 --> 58:56.066
Yeah.

58:56.137 --> 58:59.366
Actually, would you run down to Red's
and pick us up a sixer of Bud?

58:59.433 --> 59:02.630
- We've got to talk shop.
- OK, baby.

59:02.697 --> 59:04.933
- Just making friends.
- I know. Good. Just...

59:05.001 --> 59:06.211
Bye.

59:12.329 --> 59:13.670
Why do they lie, Mac?

59:13.737 --> 59:16.289
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

59:19.688 --> 59:21.728
To keep you
from knowing what you are.

59:22.504 --> 59:25.984
- What we are?
- What are we?

59:26.056 --> 59:29.917
Man, why do I gotta be the guy
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

59:33.991 --> 59:36.162
OK, look. You're...

59:38.503 --> 59:40.642
Well, you're not like me.

59:42.375 --> 59:45.440
I mean, you're not... human.

59:46.822 --> 59:50.816
I mean, you're human,
but you just, you're not real.

59:50.918 --> 59:54.627
You're not,
like, a real person. Like me.

59:57.669 --> 59:59.906
You're clones.

01:00:01.861 --> 01:00:05.538
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:07.165
- What?
- Clones?

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.342
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

01:00:09.413 --> 01:00:12.642
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a facelift

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.781
or one of 'em gets sick
and need a new part,

01:00:14.852 --> 01:00:17.089
they take it from you.

01:00:18.692 --> 01:00:21.791
But I have a mother.
I remember her.

01:00:21.892 --> 01:00:23.867
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

01:00:23.972 --> 01:00:25.914
I have a little dog and I had a bike.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.481
And a bike. Right.

01:00:27.588 --> 01:00:30.849
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars

01:00:30.915 --> 01:00:33.020
and you rode it
to your grandmother's.

01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:36.222
You ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies.

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:37.568
Yeah.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:41.661
No. Memory imprints.
I seen them.

01:00:41.731 --> 01:00:44.797
A buddy of mine is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:48.314
There's only 12 stories.
They change around little details,

01:00:48.386 --> 01:00:50.524
but they're all pretty much the same.

01:00:50.594 --> 01:00:55.809
The life you think you had
before the "contamination,"

01:00:55.874 --> 01:00:58.208
it never happened.

01:00:59.426 --> 01:01:02.906
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

01:01:02.978 --> 01:01:06.971
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood, be my guest.

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:08.535
How long?

01:01:09.569 --> 01:01:11.162
How long have we been alive?

01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:15.103
You're Echo generation,
so you're three.

01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:18.166
Delta means you're four.

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:21.754
Three?

01:01:21.825 --> 01:01:25.621
The whole reason you exist is
'cause everyone wants to live forever.

01:01:25.728 --> 01:01:27.484
It's the new American dream.

01:01:27.552 --> 01:01:30.900
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

01:01:31.008 --> 01:01:34.357
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:38.522
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.

01:01:38.591 --> 01:01:42.934
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

01:01:43.007 --> 01:01:46.585
He doesn't want anybody knowing
the truth, especially not sponsors.

01:01:46.655 --> 01:01:50.364
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.502
They, like, own you.

01:01:54.494 --> 01:02:00.157
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

01:02:00.222 --> 01:02:04.761
Just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:09.175
Besides, do you know
how many laws Merrick's breaking

01:02:09.245 --> 01:02:11.384
to have you two hatched?

01:02:13.117 --> 01:02:15.288
Your sponsors
can't have any part of that.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.658
They're like high society,
rich and famous.

01:02:17.725 --> 01:02:20.146
If they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:22.741
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the truth.

01:02:22.813 --> 01:02:24.122
- What?
- Yeah.

01:02:24.188 --> 01:02:26.195
No, that's the worst idea I ever heard.

01:02:26.268 --> 01:02:28.657
You know how dead I'd be?
Not to mention fired?

01:02:28.764 --> 01:02:31.001
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

01:02:31.068 --> 01:02:33.915
Stop, stop! Fold, stop.
Brakes. No. Come on.

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:36.597
You're the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:39.831
They're not gonna care.
What? They're gonna care?

01:02:39.899 --> 01:02:41.175
You know what I would do?

01:02:41.243 --> 01:02:44.472
I would just get as far away
from here as I could.

01:02:44.539 --> 01:02:45.716
Go to the beach.

01:02:45.787 --> 01:02:48.820
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.745
We're asking for your help.

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:54.007
Oh, God.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:06.287
Infrared's having a hard time picking up
a heat signature. Sand's too hot.

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:12.850
He was implanted
with micro-sensors yesterday.

01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:16.631
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

01:03:16.697 --> 01:03:19.861
- If we can get within half a mile.
- Do it.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.612
Your sponsors names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

01:03:22.681 --> 01:03:24.274
Her sponsor lives in New York.

01:03:24.345 --> 01:03:27.247
The number in your name
is a regional code.

01:03:27.321 --> 01:03:31.444
Six Echo, that means
your sponsor lives in LA.

01:03:31.544 --> 01:03:33.584
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state?

01:03:33.688 --> 01:03:35.117
Put this on.

01:03:35.223 --> 01:03:38.093
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

01:03:38.199 --> 01:03:40.817
Keep going. What size?

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.094
All right.

01:03:43.159 --> 01:03:45.231
These are bags, OK?
You put stuff in 'em.

01:03:45.303 --> 01:03:47.954
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:49.452
We're not idiots.

01:03:49.527 --> 01:03:52.843
Excuse me, Miss "I'm so smart
I can't wait to go to the Island."

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.252
Yeah. Good.

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:04.561
Wait. Hold, hold, hold.

01:04:04.662 --> 01:04:07.029
People don't really
wear these on the outside.

01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:09.581
These are mail-order, OK?
These stay here.

01:04:12.373 --> 01:04:16.148
No. Mail-order, OK?
Clones don't wear these.

01:04:19.765 --> 01:04:21.009
All right, listen up.

01:04:21.077 --> 01:04:24.012
This card is like stim credits, OK?

01:04:24.084 --> 01:04:26.932
Lt'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:30.925
or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

01:04:33.876 --> 01:04:34.923
All right, look.

01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:37.898
I know you're new to this
whole human experience and all,

01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.630
but there's one universal truth

01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:42.382
and that is you never
give a woman your credit card.

01:04:43.123 --> 01:04:45.032
Right.

01:04:50.771 --> 01:04:52.396
I got something. It's hot.

01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:05.066
Oh, God.

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:09.737
- Train four...
- Train'll be here. Hustle.

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:13.225
...to Sacramento
is now boarding at platform A.

01:05:13.297 --> 01:05:16.942
All right, stay. All right?
Just stay. Don't move.

01:05:18.033 --> 01:05:19.440
Mama!

01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:24.976
Look at that!

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:27.212
Those are kids.

01:05:28.944 --> 01:05:30.406
Wow.

01:05:35.888 --> 01:05:39.204
Come here. The train is non-stop to LA.
You need these to get on.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.793
When you get there, look up your
sponsors in the information directory.

01:05:42.864 --> 01:05:44.271
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:44.336 --> 01:05:47.980
- What is an information directory?
- It'll tell you where they live.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.927
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:54.919
One thing I can tell you about people,
is that they'll do anything to survive.

01:05:54.991 --> 01:05:56.878
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

01:05:57.742 --> 01:05:59.564
Thanks a lot.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:03.045
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

01:06:03.118 --> 01:06:05.387
Better not get me in trouble.

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.979
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, that's a good one.

01:06:26.188 --> 01:06:28.425
I think I got an ID.
Two in the center.

01:06:34.444 --> 01:06:36.965
Run!

01:08:08.135 --> 01:08:09.661
Run!

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:13.502
God!

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:20.926
Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform C.

01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:28.805
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:45.411
- This was supposed to be a simple job?
- It's never simple.

01:08:45.475 --> 01:08:47.068
We got a missing credit card.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:51.395
McCord just used it to buy train tickets
and it's not in his wallet.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.518
Monitor the account. Have Amtrak
patch you through to the conductor.

01:08:56.611 --> 01:08:58.399
Get me a new team in LA.

01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:03.904
- Got here as fast as I could.
- Come here.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:07.036
I finished scanning the Defense
Department Troop Selections,

01:09:07.106 --> 01:09:09.626
- if you want to see them...
- Not yet. Look at that.

01:09:11.331 --> 01:09:14.265
- Six Echo drew it.
- It's elaborate.

01:09:14.337 --> 01:09:18.395
"Renovachio." Renovatee-oh?

01:09:18.466 --> 01:09:20.888
Renovatio.
What is that, Italian?

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:22.871
It's Latin.

01:09:23.298 --> 01:09:25.403
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

01:09:25.474 --> 01:09:27.676
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

01:09:28.514 --> 01:09:30.782
So where did he learn it?

01:09:30.881 --> 01:09:32.791
Where are the results from his scan?

01:09:32.897 --> 01:09:36.606
- They'll be back from Johns Hopkins...
- Just speed it up.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:37.687
Yes, sir.

01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:51.156
You two.

01:09:51.232 --> 01:09:53.566
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please,

01:09:53.631 --> 01:09:56.598
train number 17
leaving for San Diego...

01:09:56.671 --> 01:09:59.126
- There!
...was delayed 20 minutes. Stand by.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.800
We just arrived, but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

01:11:53.592 --> 01:11:57.039
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

01:11:57.111 --> 01:11:58.573
Thanks.

01:12:03.959 --> 01:12:06.807
Wilshire. 5th. Grand.

01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:11.605
Spring. Grand Avenue?
Smile for the camera, sweetheart.

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:22.738
Where is Flower?
You on Flower?

01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:26.068
Olive, Olive.
Come on, come on.

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:28.108
You look familiar.

01:12:28.662 --> 01:12:29.774
Gotcha.

01:12:32.118 --> 01:12:34.485
Three Black Wasps
and two jet bikes.

01:12:34.549 --> 01:12:36.938
We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

01:12:37.013 --> 01:12:39.118
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

01:12:42.549 --> 01:12:44.491
We're moving! Let's go.

01:12:55.732 --> 01:12:57.674
Wait. Got a hit
on McCord's credit card.

01:12:57.748 --> 01:13:00.203
Location, Grand Avenue at 9830.

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:02.926
Team, proceed immediately to 9830.

01:13:02.995 --> 01:13:06.889
No, no, no. LAPD's moving in.
They've flagged McCord's credit card.

01:13:06.963 --> 01:13:09.997
- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.

01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:14.480
- Not listed.
- Sarah Jordan.

01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:22.122
Hello?

01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:25.128
Yes, I'm looking for Sarah Jordan.

01:13:25.746 --> 01:13:28.047
She's sick.

01:13:28.114 --> 01:13:32.074
- Can I talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.

01:13:32.145 --> 01:13:34.447
Mommy, is that you?

01:13:49.648 --> 01:13:51.885
Jordan. Let's go!

01:13:54.192 --> 01:13:56.047
Freeze! Put your hands up!

01:13:56.112 --> 01:13:58.414
- Keep your hands off!
- Put your hands up!

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.389
Do as I say! Do as I say!

01:14:01.648 --> 01:14:03.852
- Lincoln.
- Just do what they say.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.327
Lincoln.

01:14:05.391 --> 01:14:06.536
- Pull back.
- Move out.

01:14:06.607 --> 01:14:08.200
What's going on?

01:14:16.687 --> 01:14:18.858
Nail it! Quick, move!

01:14:29.038 --> 01:14:32.201
We're detaining you in connection
to the murder of James McCord.

01:14:32.269 --> 01:14:35.303
- What? He was my friend!
- Anything you say can and will be used

01:14:35.374 --> 01:14:37.959
- against you in a court of law.
- What's a court of law?

01:14:41.421 --> 01:14:44.552
They'll run DNA.
If the agnates are booked,

01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:47.523
it'll implicate your clients
in a murder investigation.

01:14:47.597 --> 01:14:48.774
This is a nightmare.

01:14:48.877 --> 01:14:51.659
You cannot allow this to happen.
Do you understand me?

01:14:51.724 --> 01:14:54.026
You use any force that is necessary.

01:14:54.092 --> 01:14:56.547
I'm ordering you
to contain the situation.

01:14:56.652 --> 01:14:59.751
1-Adam-82, we've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults, no ID.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.373
Notify Forensics,
we'll need DNA typing.

01:15:02.444 --> 01:15:04.810
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.942
- Could you look up my file, please?
- Sit back.

01:15:22.219 --> 01:15:24.837
Dispatch, we're two minutes out.

01:15:34.186 --> 01:15:36.160
- Check inside!
- Hey, can you hear me?

01:15:36.233 --> 01:15:39.200
Lincoln, get up!
Get up, Lincoln! Get up!

01:15:45.577 --> 01:15:46.689
Let's go!

01:15:47.337 --> 01:15:49.028
Go! Go! Go!

01:15:49.801 --> 01:15:50.848
Go!

01:15:54.441 --> 01:15:56.001
We got cops. We got cops!

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.677
Get down!

01:16:11.847 --> 01:16:13.734
Run!

01:16:14.407 --> 01:16:16.928
I see them! Let's get moving!

01:16:18.151 --> 01:16:20.769
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

01:16:21.671 --> 01:16:23.012
Move, move!

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.834
Move out! Move out!

01:16:35.238 --> 01:16:36.929
Come on!

01:16:45.413 --> 01:16:47.999
Go, go, go, go! Go!

01:16:58.596 --> 01:17:00.451
Shit! Check up here!

01:17:01.605 --> 01:17:02.979
Come on!

01:17:37.698 --> 01:17:40.697
Air-Two, give me status of the targets.

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:44.508
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently, take them out.

01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:48.376
Go!

01:17:51.137 --> 01:17:52.860
Move! Go, go!

01:17:52.929 --> 01:17:54.423
- I can't fit!
- Move back!

01:17:54.497 --> 01:17:55.707
I can't fit!

01:18:13.311 --> 01:18:14.740
Look out, look out!

01:18:20.767 --> 01:18:22.109
Right, right, right!

01:18:36.254 --> 01:18:37.236
Stay on them!

01:18:39.422 --> 01:18:40.829
Look out!

01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:47.767
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:11.255
Good job!

01:19:12.636 --> 01:19:15.931
We've gotta bail out of here,
there's police choppers inbound.

01:19:24.251 --> 01:19:26.073
Black Wasp, take out the truck!

01:19:36.378 --> 01:19:38.483
Troy, you all right? Let's go!

01:19:43.066 --> 01:19:44.048
Cops! Cops!

01:20:06.904 --> 01:20:08.148
He's coming back!

01:20:10.712 --> 01:20:11.890
Stay down, Jordan!

01:20:38.966 --> 01:20:42.282
- How do you know what you're doing?
- I don't know!

01:21:38.867 --> 01:21:40.110
Hold on!

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:43.082
Look out!

01:21:50.162 --> 01:21:51.339
Look out!

01:21:58.641 --> 01:22:00.812
Hold on!

01:22:17.968 --> 01:22:20.783
- Don't let me go, Lincoln!
- I got you! I got you!

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:22.888
- Don't let me go!
- I got you!

01:22:23.599 --> 01:22:26.861
I'm slipping!
Don't drop me, Lincoln!

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:30.123
- Don't drop me!
- I got you! I got you!

01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:36.102
Lincoln! Pull me! Pull me!

01:22:37.871 --> 01:22:39.878
Climb up!

01:22:42.766 --> 01:22:45.384
If there's no way to get
our fugitives quietly,

01:22:45.454 --> 01:22:47.626
you need to take them out.

01:22:50.734 --> 01:22:52.872
I see our targets about 70 stories up.

01:22:52.974 --> 01:22:55.275
They're on top of the building logo.

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:00.231
Tough day.

01:23:00.878 --> 01:23:02.252
Let's roll.

01:23:03.821 --> 01:23:05.959
LAPD! Get away from the window!

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:11.204
Jay, you got him?

01:23:12.845 --> 01:23:14.699
Right there! Right there!
Get him!

01:23:22.859 --> 01:23:25.729
Stay there! Damn it!
Just stay down!

01:23:26.284 --> 01:23:27.778
Come on!

01:23:31.275 --> 01:23:33.828
Gonna swing around to get a shot.

01:23:39.659 --> 01:23:40.968
He's coming back.

01:23:56.426 --> 01:23:57.538
Oh, no.

01:24:01.129 --> 01:24:03.464
Hang on!
They're coming off the building.

01:24:28.807 --> 01:24:30.563
Look out!

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:46.876
Jesus must love you!

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:49.219
That was the craziest mess
I ever seen!

01:24:49.286 --> 01:24:52.799
Come on, girl.
I know Jesus loves you.

01:25:02.405 --> 01:25:04.958
Can you keep a secret, doc?

01:25:05.029 --> 01:25:06.589
Why, yes, of course.

01:25:06.661 --> 01:25:08.832
There is something
going on around here.

01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:11.105
Something you may
not even know about.

01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:12.188
What is it?

01:25:12.261 --> 01:25:17.247
Well, I'm not sure that
the contamination is real.

01:25:17.317 --> 01:25:19.226
- Why do you think that?
- OK.

01:25:19.301 --> 01:25:24.003
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

01:25:24.068 --> 01:25:25.529
- Wow.
- Right.

01:25:25.604 --> 01:25:28.386
And I think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

01:25:28.452 --> 01:25:31.005
Have you told
anyone else about this?

01:25:31.108 --> 01:25:34.882
No, no. But I'm gonna do some digging.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

01:25:34.979 --> 01:25:37.597
And when I do,
I'll share my information with you.

01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:39.260
Thank you.

01:25:39.331 --> 01:25:41.469
I want to be helpful.
I like it here.

01:25:41.539 --> 01:25:43.263
Good.

01:25:43.331 --> 01:25:45.698
But I really want to look
into the lottery too.

01:25:45.763 --> 01:25:48.730
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

01:25:48.803 --> 01:25:50.559
You know,

01:25:50.627 --> 01:25:53.082
you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

01:25:53.155 --> 01:25:55.259
You're very smart.

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:57.916
Yeah. I remember
when I first came here.

01:26:00.514 --> 01:26:03.099
A survivor, just like you.

01:26:03.202 --> 01:26:05.689
One of the first, in fact.

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:09.568
It's natural, even healthy,
to question the world we're presented.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:12.960
You might say it's only...
only human.

01:26:15.329 --> 01:26:17.750
Oh, that burns!

01:26:19.456 --> 01:26:23.034
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.366
I saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:45.245
We'll go there when the rain stops.

01:26:45.855 --> 01:26:48.855
- It'll be OK when we find him.
- OK.

01:26:54.174 --> 01:26:56.989
That little boy looked like me.

01:26:59.998 --> 01:27:02.267
His mom's gonna die, isn't she?

01:27:03.358 --> 01:27:04.983
I don't know.

01:27:07.741 --> 01:27:09.334
You're lying.

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:18.652
It's cold.

01:28:06.522 --> 01:28:07.667
Go in.

01:28:08.377 --> 01:28:09.654
I can't.

01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:13.806
- I'll go in.
- Jordan. Jordan!

01:28:17.305 --> 01:28:19.029
Hello?

01:28:21.689 --> 01:28:23.445
Hello?

01:29:09.238 --> 01:29:10.831
Lincoln!

01:29:27.253 --> 01:29:29.424
Oh, my God.

01:29:31.604 --> 01:29:34.255
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

01:29:34.324 --> 01:29:36.975
I'm your insurance policy.

01:29:51.315 --> 01:29:53.933
And what are you doing in my house?

01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:00.428
Sir, sir.

01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:05.000
You need to see this.
It's a... It's...

01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:06.859
It's beautiful.

01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:09.647
This is a synaptic scan
we took of Six Echo three years ago,

01:30:09.714 --> 01:30:12.583
before we integrated him
into the agnate population. OK?

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:16.432
This is his scan from a few days ago.
You can see how much the memory's grown.

01:30:16.497 --> 01:30:19.813
Like he's experienced 30 years,
not three, which is impossible.

01:30:19.922 --> 01:30:23.751
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't...

01:30:23.857 --> 01:30:27.850
An infection can't teach you Latin,
or how to fly.

01:30:34.352 --> 01:30:36.556
They are memories.

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:40.329
But they're not his.

01:30:41.872 --> 01:30:44.490
They belong to his sponsor.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.447
I've seen you before.

01:30:47.471 --> 01:30:49.860
I've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...

01:30:49.967 --> 01:30:53.579
- Maxim?
- Oh, they're men's magazines.

01:30:53.647 --> 01:30:58.502
Pictures of women
with little, tight, short...

01:30:58.575 --> 01:31:02.285
...stories too.
Anyway, you're very popular.

01:31:05.006 --> 01:31:06.795
There we are.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.453
What is that?

01:31:09.518 --> 01:31:11.623
That looks like some kind of thermal...

01:31:14.382 --> 01:31:17.229
Boy, your skin is so soft.

01:31:17.294 --> 01:31:19.333
Did you know?

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:26.722
I put some clothes
out for you upstairs.

01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:29.862
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:31:39.372 --> 01:31:41.543
I keep expecting to wake up.

01:31:41.612 --> 01:31:43.881
I thought I was taller.

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.529
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

01:31:48.555 --> 01:31:51.272
She is unbelievable.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:54.819
How is it you've been around three
years and end up with the kind of woman

01:31:54.923 --> 01:31:57.541
I haven't been able to find
my whole life? Give me that.

01:31:57.643 --> 01:32:01.058
She found me.
She's my best friend.

01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:04.392
- Why do we sound different?
- I'm from Scotland.

01:32:04.459 --> 01:32:06.466
I'm from Scotland.

01:32:06.538 --> 01:32:09.385
Hey, look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:12.582
- Without that.
- No, really, cut it out.

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:14.559
That's enough.

01:32:14.634 --> 01:32:17.219
Yeah, that is enough.
I'm sorry.

01:32:17.834 --> 01:32:19.743
Like a freak show.

01:32:19.818 --> 01:32:21.793
Yeah, it's weird.

01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:29.024
- So, you build boats?
- I design them. I draw them, yeah.

01:32:29.865 --> 01:32:31.272
Here.

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:35.909
I started off with cars, motorcycles.
Experimental designs.

01:32:35.977 --> 01:32:39.173
Anything that blew my hair back.
Kind of a speed freak, you know?

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.607
- Petrol-head.
- Motorcycles, wow.

01:32:41.672 --> 01:32:45.447
- I feel like I've seen these before.
- It's something I've always done.

01:32:45.512 --> 01:32:47.748
I never dreamt it would make me rich.

01:32:47.815 --> 01:32:49.342
What's Renovatio?

01:32:49.416 --> 01:32:52.099
"Renovatio" in Latin means rebirth.

01:32:52.167 --> 01:32:53.923
Subtle, eh?

01:32:54.407 --> 01:32:58.237
Look. I have cirrhotic hepatitis.

01:32:58.343 --> 01:33:01.125
A parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

01:33:01.607 --> 01:33:03.199
What?

01:33:03.303 --> 01:33:05.986
Lots and lots of sex.

01:33:07.047 --> 01:33:09.894
- Sex?
- Sex with...

01:33:10.822 --> 01:33:12.764
You've... You're a virgin?

01:33:14.246 --> 01:33:17.824
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:23.808
OK, I'm not gonna spoil the surprise,
but, boy, are you in for a treat.

01:33:23.878 --> 01:33:27.772
Look, my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

01:33:32.101 --> 01:33:35.516
I'm not good at all this shite,
you know? Confessions and regret.

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.602
Look.

01:33:40.676 --> 01:33:42.913
There are people who are following us.

01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:46.296
They're trying to kill us.
The reason we came is we need your help.

01:33:46.372 --> 01:33:47.484
Help you do what?

01:33:47.556 --> 01:33:49.695
To show people
what the Institute does.

01:33:50.307 --> 01:33:53.122
But who'd believe it?
I'm looking at you and I don't.

01:33:53.732 --> 01:33:57.441
Who is that guy? I know him.
Is he the Community Announcer?

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:59.068
He's the President of America.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.790
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

01:34:01.891 --> 01:34:03.582
Yeah, I never liked him, either.

01:34:03.683 --> 01:34:06.334
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

01:34:06.403 --> 01:34:08.607
Then if we can get
on there together,

01:34:08.675 --> 01:34:10.584
people will see us and know the truth.

01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:13.178
So the idea is that we both
just waltz down to NBC

01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:15.617
and see if they can slot us in
after the weather.

01:34:15.682 --> 01:34:19.708
This might not mean anything to you,
but there are thousands of us.

01:34:19.778 --> 01:34:22.495
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:31.294
Help us.

01:34:33.921 --> 01:34:36.920
All right.
Let me just get my shoes, OK?

01:34:54.975 --> 01:34:57.397
Tom, hurry up!

01:35:01.023 --> 01:35:02.812
Merrick Institute.

01:35:03.999 --> 01:35:06.868
- Merrick Biotech. How may I help you?
- This is Tom Lincoln.

01:35:06.975 --> 01:35:09.276
- Hi, Mr. Lincoln.
- I was wondering if you could

01:35:09.343 --> 01:35:11.830
get someone who can explain
why my insurance policy

01:35:11.935 --> 01:35:14.007
is sitting downstairs
on my fucking sofa.

01:35:14.559 --> 01:35:17.079
- Can you hold, please?
- Sure.

01:35:27.806 --> 01:35:31.799
I'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
I was getting myself organized.

01:35:31.869 --> 01:35:34.073
OK, shall we go?
Are you ready?

01:35:42.428 --> 01:35:44.283
- Something's wrong.
- What?

01:35:46.428 --> 01:35:50.170
His eyes are lying.
The same as yours do.

01:35:50.236 --> 01:35:51.513
You stay here.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.522
- No, don't...
- Shall we?

01:35:54.012 --> 01:35:56.433
- Yeah.
- Is everything OK?

01:35:56.508 --> 01:35:59.475
Yeah. She's gonna stay here
in case they don't believe us.

01:35:59.547 --> 01:36:01.686
No, come on, we'll all go.
It'll be good.

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:02.835
No, she's gonna stay.

01:36:08.923 --> 01:36:11.443
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:36:12.986 --> 01:36:14.263
That's...

01:36:23.418 --> 01:36:26.135
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

01:36:26.202 --> 01:36:28.919
- I'll drive.
- Oh, no. I'll drive.

01:36:28.986 --> 01:36:30.993
No, really.

01:36:31.066 --> 01:36:33.008
Do you know how?

01:36:33.082 --> 01:36:36.594
- Yeah, I taught myself.
- But you don't know the way.

01:36:36.665 --> 01:36:38.967
Well, then you can show me.

01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:45.103
Well, be careful.
This is a V-12-09 Caddy.

01:36:45.209 --> 01:36:49.431
Seven hundred and fifty horsepower,
$500,000 car.

01:36:52.185 --> 01:36:53.745
Put your thumb on that.

01:36:56.183 --> 01:36:58.802
You were worth every penny.
We've the same prints.

01:36:58.872 --> 01:37:00.976
- What are you doing?
- Getting directions.

01:37:01.047 --> 01:37:03.698
Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Where would you like to go?

01:37:03.767 --> 01:37:05.589
KNBC news studio.

01:37:05.655 --> 01:37:09.430
- One moment, please.
- Thanks for doing this.

01:37:09.495 --> 01:37:13.521
That's all right. I'd like to think
you'd do the same thing if you were me.

01:37:16.887 --> 01:37:20.203
- How much did I cost?
- Five million dollars.

01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:21.554
Is that a lot?

01:37:21.622 --> 01:37:24.437
It's a small price to pay
to cheat death.

01:37:39.413 --> 01:37:41.650
That's a red.
It's a red. Red. Red!

01:37:41.717 --> 01:37:43.473
- Stop the car!
- Why? What? Why?

01:37:43.541 --> 01:37:45.908
It's a red light! Stop the car!

01:37:48.565 --> 01:37:49.645
What's the matter?

01:37:49.748 --> 01:37:53.043
You wanker! It's a red light! Stop!
It means stop!

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:55.442
- I didn't know that.
- You said you could drive.

01:37:55.508 --> 01:37:59.053
Well, I do know how to drive.
I just don't know what the lights mean.

01:38:05.459 --> 01:38:07.499
I'm sorry. I'm not ready to die.

01:38:10.931 --> 01:38:12.654
Me neither!

01:38:17.043 --> 01:38:18.123
Go, go, go, go!

01:38:20.243 --> 01:38:21.770
- What are you doing? Stop!
- No.

01:38:21.842 --> 01:38:23.981
- Stop the car now!
- No!

01:38:32.529 --> 01:38:33.773
- I'll shoot! Stop!
- No!

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:35.946
- Yes!
- No!

01:38:45.745 --> 01:38:48.079
There's cars coming at us
in all directions!

01:39:07.568 --> 01:39:08.909
They're shooting my car!

01:39:10.095 --> 01:39:12.997
They've shot the engine!
They've shot my engine!

01:39:13.679 --> 01:39:15.654
Oh, God, my nose!

01:39:38.157 --> 01:39:40.808
Come here! Where'd you think
you were going, eh?

01:39:46.445 --> 01:39:47.721
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

01:39:47.789 --> 01:39:49.065
Get up!

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.226
- Get off me!
- Come on, get up!

01:39:52.301 --> 01:39:54.472
- Let me go!
- Get up!

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:57.889
No, no, no, don't shoot him.
I need him. I need him.

01:40:03.852 --> 01:40:06.667
No, don't shoot!
He's my clone!

01:40:11.084 --> 01:40:13.418
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- What?

01:40:13.483 --> 01:40:16.232
No, I'm Tom Lincoln! He's lying.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:19.747
Shut up! I own you!

01:40:20.363 --> 01:40:22.981
He's the... I'm Tom Lincoln!

01:40:23.051 --> 01:40:25.604
Don't point the gun at me,
you frickin' idiot!

01:40:25.675 --> 01:40:29.057
- He's the clone. Look at him!
- I'm not a clone! I'm Tom!

01:40:29.131 --> 01:40:32.262
No, I'm Tom! He's lying!
Point it at him!

01:40:32.362 --> 01:40:34.021
- No. I'm not.
- Shut up!

01:40:34.122 --> 01:40:37.057
Shut up, you're a clone! Shut up!

01:40:37.162 --> 01:40:39.071
I'm Tom Lincoln!

01:40:39.145 --> 01:40:41.055
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- Don't, don't...

01:40:47.081 --> 01:40:48.291
Oh, shit.

01:41:14.663 --> 01:41:16.518
Close.

01:41:23.398 --> 01:41:27.359
Do you think it's strange that my
insurance policy just tried to kill me?

01:41:27.431 --> 01:41:30.464
I found this whole operation strange.

01:41:30.534 --> 01:41:32.421
Where's the woman?

01:41:32.487 --> 01:41:35.683
She said she was going out of state...

01:41:35.782 --> 01:41:37.189
...to look for her sponsor.

01:41:38.118 --> 01:41:42.111
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

01:41:42.182 --> 01:41:46.971
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

01:41:47.045 --> 01:41:49.346
That kind of secret?

01:41:49.957 --> 01:41:52.674
Have you talked
with anyone else about this?

01:41:52.741 --> 01:41:54.497
Who would believe it?

01:41:54.565 --> 01:41:56.507
Can I count on that?

01:41:56.581 --> 01:41:58.752
The only thing you can count on

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:02.398
is that people will
do anything to survive.

01:42:02.468 --> 01:42:07.683
I just want to live.
I don't care how.

01:42:11.364 --> 01:42:13.535
Thank you.

01:42:13.604 --> 01:42:16.768
Thank you very much.
Job well done.

01:42:22.947 --> 01:42:25.947
Jordan? Jordan?

01:42:26.019 --> 01:42:28.255
Stop.

01:42:30.115 --> 01:42:33.431
Hey, Jordan, it's me. It's me.

01:42:51.073 --> 01:42:53.048
It's you.

01:43:18.272 --> 01:43:22.232
- Wow, that tongue thing is amazing.
- I know. Open your mouth again.

01:43:24.223 --> 01:43:27.070
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

01:43:49.533 --> 01:43:52.119
The Island is real.

01:43:52.957 --> 01:43:54.648
It's us.

01:43:57.597 --> 01:44:00.379
- How many are affected?
- About half.

01:44:00.445 --> 01:44:03.412
We're seeing the same
neural patterns in all of the Echos,

01:44:03.485 --> 01:44:07.281
plus every subsequent generation:
The Foxtrots, Gammas and Helos.

01:44:07.356 --> 01:44:10.869
We predicated
our entire system on predictability.

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:15.162
Six Echo has displayed
the one trait that undermines it:

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:17.627
Human curiosity.

01:44:18.812 --> 01:44:23.863
So... we're now
facing four generations

01:44:23.931 --> 01:44:27.062
with the potential
for defiant behavior.

01:44:28.187 --> 01:44:30.259
What are you suggesting?

01:44:30.331 --> 01:44:32.371
A recall.

01:44:32.858 --> 01:44:37.168
Wait, you mean dispose of over
200 million dollars' worth of product?

01:44:37.243 --> 01:44:39.763
- Yes.
- Great.

01:44:39.834 --> 01:44:43.576
Cisco IP Communicator.
Connecting to Merrick Biotech.

01:44:44.538 --> 01:44:49.426
This is Charlie Whitman, the public
relations director at Merrick Biotech.

01:44:49.530 --> 01:44:52.661
My deepest apologies for yesterday's

01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:56.024
unfortunate inconvenience you had.

01:44:56.090 --> 01:45:00.312
Your defect in your policy wasn't,
by no means, an isolated incident,

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:03.192
and it is totally correctable,
I assure you.

01:45:03.257 --> 01:45:06.639
We are calling other
valued clients right now

01:45:06.712 --> 01:45:10.007
to inform them of a recall,
so, please, call us when you get in...

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.364
Unfortunate inconvenience?

01:45:13.432 --> 01:45:15.504
That's a bit of an understatement.

01:45:15.576 --> 01:45:18.510
Mr. Lincoln, you're home.
Aren't you traumatized, sir?

01:45:18.616 --> 01:45:21.911
I mean, I had a home invasion once
where they put the gun to my head.

01:45:22.008 --> 01:45:24.397
I never forgot that.
I shook for two days.

01:45:24.503 --> 01:45:26.805
What kind of recall
are you talking about?

01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:30.864
Oh, it's a small defect that we found
in four of our product lines.

01:45:30.935 --> 01:45:33.717
What are you gonna do
with the defective products?

01:45:35.703 --> 01:45:36.947
Starting over.

01:45:38.839 --> 01:45:41.741
- Starting over?
- Absolutely nothing to worry about.

01:45:41.815 --> 01:45:43.953
We guarantee
our product 100 percent.

01:45:44.022 --> 01:45:47.186
The unfortunate inconvenience for you

01:45:47.254 --> 01:45:51.564
is we're gonna have to re-scan you
so that we can re-grow your policy.

01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:55.892
Does today work for you at all?
Pick you up by helicopter at 3:00?

01:45:55.958 --> 01:45:58.129
I'll call you back.

01:46:05.493 --> 01:46:07.053
Dr. Merrick,

01:46:07.125 --> 01:46:10.289
how do we remove the
defective products from the population

01:46:10.357 --> 01:46:12.975
without disrupting the others?

01:46:13.045 --> 01:46:15.314
We already have the mechanism in place.

01:46:16.468 --> 01:46:19.534
Dahlgren Two Foxtrot.

01:46:20.244 --> 01:46:22.633
Cooper Five Gamma.

01:46:23.444 --> 01:46:25.582
Mass winnings.

01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:31.949
He kept a journal
and a lot of maps.

01:46:32.019 --> 01:46:34.539
After I figure out how
to get that thing in the water,

01:46:34.611 --> 01:46:37.033
then we can get on it and...

01:46:37.107 --> 01:46:38.862
...we'll keep heading south.

01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:41.069
We could live like real people.

01:46:41.138 --> 01:46:43.821
Tulie Two Foxtrot.

01:46:43.890 --> 01:46:46.672
Ginsberg Two Helo.

01:46:49.586 --> 01:46:51.309
We'll disappear.

01:46:51.858 --> 01:46:53.167
Yeah.

01:46:54.385 --> 01:46:56.687
But after.

01:47:05.393 --> 01:47:07.814
All those people we left behind.

01:47:07.889 --> 01:47:10.606
Jones Three Echo.

01:47:26.992 --> 01:47:29.512
When we were escaping,

01:47:29.615 --> 01:47:31.022
I saw this room.

01:47:31.856 --> 01:47:34.572
If I could get in
and shut it down,

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.843
they'd see the truth.

01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:49.350
Gentlemen, there is, however, another
matter that requires board approval.

01:47:52.654 --> 01:47:55.850
The disposal of 200 million dollars
of infected product.

01:48:02.574 --> 01:48:04.134
All in favor?

01:48:04.238 --> 01:48:05.165
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:48:05.261 --> 01:48:06.690
Aye.

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.322
You've been chosen.

01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:23.562
You're special.

01:48:26.027 --> 01:48:27.751
Very special.

01:48:33.388 --> 01:48:35.657
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:48:35.723 --> 01:48:36.770
Thanks.

01:48:41.643 --> 01:48:42.591
Here you go.

01:48:42.667 --> 01:48:46.212
- And what do you say to the nice lady?
- Thank you!

01:49:50.887 --> 01:49:52.861
In-bound, Jordan product.

01:50:07.237 --> 01:50:10.881
- Escort her to Surgery Prep Seven.
- I better say hello.

01:50:18.948 --> 01:50:20.836
Mr. Lincoln, thank you for coming.

01:50:20.901 --> 01:50:23.519
It's great seeing you again,
and we are so, so sorry

01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:25.563
about this entire episode.

01:50:25.636 --> 01:50:28.124
I want to tell you that
we are going to be birthing

01:50:28.196 --> 01:50:30.334
a brand new agnate for you
free of charge.

01:50:30.404 --> 01:50:33.568
Won't cost you a penny. After you.

01:50:33.636 --> 01:50:36.353
Would you like an apple?
An afternoon snack...?

01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:39.387
- No. How long will this take?
- It's gonna take about an hour.

01:50:39.492 --> 01:50:41.979
I read that you're from Scotland.
I prefer Ireland.

01:50:42.083 --> 01:50:43.609
But what part in Scotland...?

01:50:43.715 --> 01:50:46.562
I realize that this small talk
is just part of yourjob,

01:50:46.659 --> 01:50:49.823
- but let's cut the shite, OK?
- Point taken. My apologies.

01:50:49.891 --> 01:50:52.192
I'm just a bit of a jabberjaw.
Chatty Cathy.

01:50:52.258 --> 01:50:54.495
Turn right. This way.

01:51:01.058 --> 01:51:02.880
I'll take her.

01:51:14.081 --> 01:51:16.601
This is gonna be the exact
same routine as last time.

01:51:16.705 --> 01:51:19.258
Mind the hose.
Technician will be here.

01:51:19.329 --> 01:51:23.551
Look at you, so young and successful.
I always wanted to get into yachting.

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.792
I hear they're taking your kidneys,

01:51:37.567 --> 01:51:41.528
your lungs, your heart.

01:51:41.599 --> 01:51:44.632
They are gonna hack you up.

01:51:50.079 --> 01:51:51.737
Too bad.

01:52:05.949 --> 01:52:07.738
No one is touching me.

01:52:09.726 --> 01:52:11.864
- Give me your Tri-Key.
- You shot me.

01:52:11.933 --> 01:52:14.650
Shut up! Give me your walkie!

01:52:17.725 --> 01:52:19.612
Get down. Get down, now!

01:53:01.498 --> 01:53:03.865
- You all right?
- Yes.

01:53:05.082 --> 01:53:06.642
Come on.

01:53:08.122 --> 01:53:09.747
I've got this figured out.

01:53:09.817 --> 01:53:11.246
I kind of...

01:53:11.322 --> 01:53:15.216
I messed it up in one area right down
in there, but the hole doesn't matter.

01:53:15.289 --> 01:53:18.355
Something's happening.
Something's happening.

01:53:18.905 --> 01:53:20.311
Hello, sir. Hello.

01:53:20.409 --> 01:53:22.100
Thank you for your patience.

01:53:22.201 --> 01:53:24.502
I'm sure you're excited
to get to the Island.

01:53:24.568 --> 01:53:27.765
If you grab your belongings
and line up in a single-file line

01:53:27.833 --> 01:53:29.872
and follow me,
we'll be on our way.

01:53:31.256 --> 01:53:35.664
Take this. Go.
You have to keep going.

01:53:35.736 --> 01:53:37.623
- Go. Go.
- OK.

01:53:37.688 --> 01:53:39.510
Go shut it down.

01:53:52.279 --> 01:53:54.515
I love that Picasso.

01:53:55.351 --> 01:53:58.001
Do you like Picasso, Mr. Laurent?

01:53:59.063 --> 01:54:03.253
You delivered on your promise.
Well done. I'm very pleased. Thank you.

01:54:03.318 --> 01:54:05.554
What about the client?
Sarah Jordan?

01:54:05.622 --> 01:54:06.669
She's doubtful.

01:54:06.742 --> 01:54:08.597
Even if the transplant's a success,

01:54:08.662 --> 01:54:11.957
her brain damage may be too severe
for any real recovery.

01:54:12.022 --> 01:54:14.193
You took too long bringing her back.

01:54:14.262 --> 01:54:16.979
The girl, you're going to harvest her,
kill her anyway,

01:54:17.046 --> 01:54:19.085
even though it won't
make any difference?

01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:23.659
That's the privilege our clients
pay for, Mr. Laurent.

01:54:23.765 --> 01:54:28.075
Now, do excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

01:54:29.044 --> 01:54:32.786
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabé Rebellion?

01:54:32.853 --> 01:54:36.780
And when he was killed,
me and my brothers were branded,

01:54:38.964 --> 01:54:42.673
so others would know
we were less than human.

01:54:43.348 --> 01:54:47.373
I've seen and done things I'm not proud
of, but at some point you realize war...

01:54:48.628 --> 01:54:50.318
...is a business.

01:54:55.187 --> 01:54:57.554
So when did killing
become a business for you?

01:55:03.379 --> 01:55:06.542
Oh, it's so much more than that.

01:55:08.914 --> 01:55:12.526
I have discovered the Holy Grail
of science, Mr. Laurent.

01:55:12.594 --> 01:55:14.154
I give life.

01:55:14.546 --> 01:55:17.994
The agnates,
they're simply tools, instruments.

01:55:18.066 --> 01:55:20.815
They have no souls.

01:55:21.201 --> 01:55:23.819
The possibilities are endless here.

01:55:23.889 --> 01:55:27.686
In two years' time, I will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

01:55:27.761 --> 01:55:31.022
How many people on Earth
can say that, Mr. Laurent?

01:55:32.721 --> 01:55:34.543
I guess just you and God.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:41.029
That's the answer
you're looking for, isn't it?

01:55:45.904 --> 01:55:48.424
Mr. Whitman has your check downstairs.

01:55:55.503 --> 01:55:58.056
Looks like single gunshot.

01:56:00.463 --> 01:56:02.154
Oh, no.

01:56:02.991 --> 01:56:04.332
Wrong wrist.

01:56:04.399 --> 01:56:08.588
Dr. Merrick,
the body thatjust came in...

01:56:08.655 --> 01:56:11.273
...is the client.

01:56:22.637 --> 01:56:25.158
Issue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

01:56:29.773 --> 01:56:32.620
Down, down, down!
Move, move!

01:56:45.356 --> 01:56:48.138
- Disturbance in the Hologram Room.
- I'm on it.

01:56:50.124 --> 01:56:53.222
Dr. Merrick, I sent censors
to check a possible attempted breach

01:56:53.291 --> 01:56:55.146
in Hologram Control.

01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:36.743
One after another,
step into the room.

01:57:36.809 --> 01:57:39.230
If I'm going to the Island,
why did I leave my bag?

01:57:39.337 --> 01:57:40.930
Step right in, thank you.

01:57:41.832 --> 01:57:45.629
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Is this the right way? I...

01:57:45.704 --> 01:57:48.322
Are you new here?
I don't know if this is the way!

01:57:48.392 --> 01:57:50.759
It's going to the Island!

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.010
I'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

01:57:59.399 --> 01:58:01.025
Open the door!

01:58:06.342 --> 01:58:09.212
She said open the door!

01:58:43.012 --> 01:58:47.649
You could have taken over his life,
but you chose to come back.

01:58:47.716 --> 01:58:50.334
You truly are unique, Six Echo.

01:58:51.043 --> 01:58:53.148
My name is Lincoln!

02:00:08.639 --> 02:00:10.581
I brought you into this world...

02:00:16.734 --> 02:00:18.490
...and I can take you out of it.

02:00:19.305 --> 02:00:25.868
