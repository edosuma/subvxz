[horn blowing]

03:59.371 --> 04:01.507

04:01.540 --> 04:02.942
All the way from the capital.

04:06.745 --> 04:08.248
[horse nickers]

04:23.896 --> 04:24.964
Colonel Joll?

04:37.509 --> 04:39.579
It's an honor to have you here.

04:48.487 --> 04:51.557
Well, you-- you must
be exhausted. Please.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.300
[horse neighs]

05:05.104 --> 05:07.940
Tell me, i-if you
don't mind me asking,

05:07.973 --> 05:10.943
what-- what are they for?

05:12.144 --> 05:13.479
They protect one's eyes

05:13.512 --> 05:16.082
against the glare of the sun.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.817
They save one from squinting.

05:19.084 --> 05:20.653
-Ah.
-Do you see?

05:21.954 --> 05:22.955
No wrinkles.

05:22.988 --> 05:24.490
[chuckles]

05:24.523 --> 05:25.958
Fewer headaches.

05:27.826 --> 05:30.463
Yes, at home,
everyone is wearing them.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.565
You would find them useful

05:32.598 --> 05:33.766
out here in the desert.

05:33.799 --> 05:35.034
Hmm.

05:39.705 --> 05:43.443
Are you familiar with
these parts of the frontier?

05:44.476 --> 05:45.445
No.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.547
Not with this part, no.

05:48.580 --> 05:53.619
With the south,
but not with this part, not yet.

05:53.652 --> 05:56.422
Well, it's not a good time
of the year to visit.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.524
You must feel the heat.

05:58.557 --> 06:00.827
I'm quite used to it, the heat.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.864
I have leave due to me,

06:04.897 --> 06:08.868
but I-I find myself
reluctant to take it.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.070
One grows to be
a part of a place.

06:12.838 --> 06:17.610
I'd feel like a foreigner
if I went back to the capital.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.979
And the capital,
too, has changed,

06:20.012 --> 06:23.749
I'm sure, since my time.

06:23.782 --> 06:26.752
I need to make an early start
of my inspection.

06:26.785 --> 06:29.088
Breakfast early, please,
first thing.

06:29.121 --> 06:30.456
Yes, sir.

06:30.489 --> 06:32.725
So if you will excuse me,

06:32.758 --> 06:34.761
I need to get some rest.

06:36.094 --> 06:38.631
I'll come by in the morning
and fetch you.

06:47.539 --> 06:49.509
[overlapping chatter]

06:57.749 --> 06:59.218
[animal bleats]

06:59.251 --> 07:00.686
Magistrate.

07:08.927 --> 07:11.130
[rooster crows]

07:19.872 --> 07:21.173
[baker] But a soldier?

07:21.206 --> 07:22.842
They-- They don't
usually send soldiers

07:22.875 --> 07:24.043
on inspections, do they?

07:24.076 --> 07:26.212
Mm, who's the inspector now?

07:26.245 --> 07:27.613
[both laugh]

07:27.646 --> 07:28.948
You're far too inquisitive,
my friend.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.249
No, he's not a soldier.

07:30.282 --> 07:32.485
He wears a uniform,
but he's not a soldier.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.687
He's a policeman,
a colonel of the police,

07:34.720 --> 07:38.958
very important person from
the Bureau of State Security.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.994
Once in every generation,

07:42.027 --> 07:44.930
without fail,
along the frontier,

07:44.963 --> 07:50.503
there is an episode of hysteria
about the barbarians.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.873
It's the consequence
of too much ease.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.941
Why don't they leave us alone?

07:55.974 --> 07:58.811
They have their own territories,
don't they?

07:58.844 --> 08:01.080
We have to protect ourselves.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.648
Protect ourselves, my dear?

08:02.681 --> 08:04.950
Against what? Against whom?

08:04.983 --> 08:06.252
Against them.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.521
We protect ourselves
against wild animals,

08:08.554 --> 08:10.122
against snakes.

08:10.155 --> 08:13.058
If an angry bear
approaches you,

08:13.091 --> 08:14.760
you'd kill it, Magistrate,
wouldn't you?

08:14.793 --> 08:16.729
[laughs] No, my friends.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.864
I-I will be quite content

08:18.897 --> 08:21.967
to pass quietly away
and merit no more

08:22.000 --> 08:25.070
than three lines
in the imperial gazette

08:25.103 --> 08:27.940
that with nudge here
and a touch there,

08:27.973 --> 08:30.776
I kept the world
on its course.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.547
[insects chirping]

09:03.742 --> 09:04.877
We ready to go?

09:15.821 --> 09:17.756
I must tell you
that we don't have

09:17.789 --> 09:19.792
proper facilities
for prisoners.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.226
There's no need.

09:21.259 --> 09:24.196
There's not much--
There's not much crime here,

09:24.229 --> 09:28.834
and the penalty's usually
a fine or compulsory labor,

09:28.867 --> 09:30.970
so we simply use
the old barracks.

09:31.003 --> 09:34.073
[chuckles] Where we
also store provisions.

09:40.379 --> 09:41.681
Just a minute.

09:42.714 --> 09:44.116
Let me speak with them.

09:44.149 --> 09:46.619
I know a little of the language.

09:59.197 --> 10:00.232
[speaking local language]

10:12.944 --> 10:15.047
I think it must be your glasses.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.851
He's probably never
seen anything like them before.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.621
[chuckles]
He may think that you're blind.

10:29.027 --> 10:29.996
[speaking local language]

10:36.368 --> 10:38.237
Hmm?

10:38.270 --> 10:39.772
Do you understand?

11:14.973 --> 11:17.877
Show the Excellency.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.819
-[raspy breath]
-Hmm.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.220
It's his sister's boy.

11:28.253 --> 11:30.790
They've come to get medicine.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.064
...Excellency.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.933
All right.

11:40.966 --> 11:41.934
Thank you.

11:43.502 --> 11:45.738
-[speaking local language]
-Whatever you call it,

11:45.771 --> 11:48.474
banditry, sheep stealing,

11:48.507 --> 11:52.010
it really--
it doesn't amount to much.

11:52.043 --> 11:54.947
These nomads,
barbarians, if you will,

11:54.980 --> 11:57.416
will be gone in a month
back up into the mountains.

11:57.449 --> 12:00.819
They migrate.
They're always on the move.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.454
He says he came for medicine.

12:02.487 --> 12:05.524
He may be telling the truth.
Who knows?

12:05.557 --> 12:09.128
Who would have brought
an old man and a sick boy

12:09.161 --> 12:10.829
along on a raiding party?

12:10.862 --> 12:13.232
Nevertheless,
I will question them.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.403
You can learn surprising things.

12:18.837 --> 12:20.439
I'll bring one of my men along,

12:20.472 --> 12:23.108
and I will need someone
to assist with the language.

12:23.141 --> 12:25.244
Well, let me.
I-I'd be glad to help.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.245
No, no.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.214
You would find it tedious.

12:29.314 --> 12:32.151
We have set procedures.

12:33.385 --> 12:38.090
Uh, tell me,
wh-what are your procedures?

12:40.992 --> 12:42.361
Patience...

12:44.229 --> 12:45.197
and pressure.

12:47.065 --> 12:50.035
That is the only way
to get to the truth.

12:51.136 --> 12:52.237
But how do you know

12:52.270 --> 12:54.039
you are hearing the truth?

12:57.209 --> 12:58.978
There is a certain tone.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.916
A certain tone enters the voice.

13:06.952 --> 13:11.390
You come to recognize it
with training and experience.

13:13.625 --> 13:17.463
Can you tell
whether I am telling the truth?

13:19.598 --> 13:22.401
You misunderstand.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.304
I am speaking
of particular situations,

13:25.337 --> 13:28.808
situations where I
am probing for the truth.

13:32.143 --> 13:34.146
First you get lies.

13:35.347 --> 13:37.616
First lies,

13:37.649 --> 13:39.451
then pressure,

13:39.484 --> 13:41.453
then more lies,

13:41.486 --> 13:43.155
then more pressure...

13:44.189 --> 13:48.260
then more lies, more pressure...

13:50.629 --> 13:52.264
and then comes the break.

13:54.199 --> 13:56.836
After the break,
more pressure...

14:00.472 --> 14:03.475
and then at last the truth.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.848
That is how you get it.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.484
Pain is truth.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.888
All else is subject to doubt.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.127
No, that one says
that the very same pig

14:22.160 --> 14:24.396
keeps breaking in to his garden
and damaging the produce,

14:24.429 --> 14:26.265
and now he's not going
to give it back

14:26.298 --> 14:27.299
until he's paid compensation.

14:29.301 --> 14:33.939
Excellency, the pig
is worth a lot of money.

14:33.972 --> 14:36.909
His garden is worth nothing,
nothing.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.278
It's a nothing
that has no proper fence.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.413
-Be quiet. Be quiet.
-[door opens]

14:41.446 --> 14:44.416
Everybody knows that he
doesn't have a proper title.

14:44.449 --> 14:45.684
He can't put up a fence,

14:45.717 --> 14:47.986
because he doesn't have
a proper title.

14:48.019 --> 14:50.923
-Come on. Show him your title.
-Just be quiet, please.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.958
-[boots echoing]
-Sir...

14:52.991 --> 14:55.627
if I can speak
to the Excellency?

14:55.660 --> 14:58.931
I have warned him many times
about his pig,

14:58.964 --> 15:01.133
and he pays no attention.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.269
Why must I suffer for his pig?

15:04.703 --> 15:07.372
"His pig." You have his pig.

15:07.405 --> 15:09.041
I have his pig,

15:09.074 --> 15:11.944
and I am keeping it
until he pays for the damages.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.212
Why should I pay?
Who says I should pay?

15:14.245 --> 15:16.081
Give him back his pig.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.350
And?

15:21.186 --> 15:23.422
And that is all.

15:45.744 --> 15:48.013
[sifter shakes]

15:53.752 --> 15:54.954
Sir.

16:09.801 --> 16:11.971
[brushing]

16:13.772 --> 16:16.174
-Your bed's ready, sir.
-Mm-hmm.

16:16.207 --> 16:18.577
-Anything more?
-No, thank you.

16:20.745 --> 16:23.181
What is that?

16:23.214 --> 16:27.085
This is-- It's a child's shoe
from long ago.

16:27.118 --> 16:28.587
-Shoe?
-Mm-hmm.

16:30.221 --> 16:31.490
You're gonna keep it?

16:33.091 --> 16:34.259
Mm-hmm.

[sighs]

16:39.531 --> 16:41.467
[brushing]

16:46.371 --> 16:48.407
What does it say?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.609
I have no idea.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.712
It's old writing...

16:54.779 --> 16:56.448
from the old days.

16:57.782 --> 17:00.586
No one writes like this anymore.

There's a letter

[flies buzzing]

19:16.654 --> 19:17.723
Close it.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.559
Close it. Close it.

19:24.729 --> 19:26.265
Tie it shut.

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

-What have they done to him?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.641
A knife.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.644
Just a little knife like this.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.219

[speaks local word]

20:25.356 --> 20:27.960
Ah. He wants water.
Give it to him.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.429
And...

20:31.863 --> 20:36.401
have that removed,
taken out of here immediately.

20:42.073 --> 20:43.608
And what does this mean?

20:43.641 --> 20:45.344
It means...

20:46.477 --> 20:48.847
that we have
our first confession,

20:48.880 --> 20:52.350
means that I am doing
what I was sent here to do.

20:52.383 --> 20:54.819
It means that we are
beginning to understand

20:54.852 --> 20:56.822
what is going on
on the border.

20:58.089 --> 21:00.058
Today we have
the beginnings of information

21:00.091 --> 21:03.695
and now are in the position
to go out and gather more.

21:03.728 --> 21:05.463
-I--
-First thing tomorrow morning,

21:05.496 --> 21:07.599
I shall be taking out
a party with that boy--

21:07.632 --> 21:11.303
yes, that same boy--
as my guide.

21:12.737 --> 21:14.939
I think he will be a good guide.

21:14.972 --> 21:17.276
He knows by now what I want.

21:21.079 --> 21:23.415
As for you, it would be helpful

21:23.448 --> 21:25.450
if you would put together
some pack animals

21:25.483 --> 21:28.486
and some provisions
for a week or so

21:28.519 --> 21:29.587
and a dozen of your men,

21:29.620 --> 21:33.292
good men
familiar with the country.

21:34.726 --> 21:38.363
What kind of information,
sheep stealing? Smuggling?

21:38.396 --> 21:41.600
Are you killing old men
for sheep now?

21:52.043 --> 21:54.413
Record of the interrogation.

22:14.065 --> 22:15.701
Come away. Come away.

22:17.869 --> 22:23.041
Did you really tell the officer
that your clan is arming itself?

22:24.409 --> 22:25.877
Did you really say
that there will be

22:25.910 --> 22:28.847
a great war against the Empire?

22:28.880 --> 22:30.548
It's stupid.

22:30.581 --> 22:32.651
Why do you tell such lies?

22:33.684 --> 22:34.886
[speaks local language]

22:36.821 --> 22:38.790
I think he's very sick, sir,

22:38.823 --> 22:40.726
very sick and very sore.

22:43.961 --> 22:45.797
[Magistrate]
W-With no disrespect, Colonel,

22:45.830 --> 22:49.000
you've never campaigned on this
inhospitable frontier before

22:49.033 --> 22:53.037
You have no guide except a child
who's terrified of you.

22:53.070 --> 22:54.739
As for them,
you cannot rely on them.

22:54.772 --> 22:56.574
They're conscripts.
Most of them have never been

22:56.607 --> 22:58.576
more than five miles
from this settlement.

22:58.609 --> 23:00.812
The barbarians
whom you are chasing will--

23:00.845 --> 23:03.448
will vanish into the desert
before you catch sight of them.

23:03.481 --> 23:05.116
They live here.
This is their land.

23:05.149 --> 23:07.719
They know every inch of it.
You do not.

23:07.752 --> 23:09.488
I have orders to obey.

23:10.855 --> 23:13.758
May I remind you, Colonel,
that if you get lost,

23:13.791 --> 23:16.761
it will be up to me to find you

23:16.794 --> 23:19.764
and bring you back
to civilization.

23:19.797 --> 23:20.832
Of course.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.570
Don't stake your life
on my maps, sir.

23:25.603 --> 23:26.971
I'm not a surveyor.

23:27.004 --> 23:28.440
I patched them together

23:28.473 --> 23:30.542
from tales told to me
by travelers.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.743
I've never been
where you're going.

23:31.776 --> 23:34.546
I earnestly advise you
not to go.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.810
[insects chirping]

24:05.943 --> 24:07.879
[bird warbling]

24:25.096 --> 24:26.164
[flies buzz]

24:30.902 --> 24:32.137
82.

24:33.604 --> 24:35.607
82.

24:45.116 --> 24:46.985
Why must you...

24:48.252 --> 24:49.754
send people...

24:50.821 --> 24:54.659
with no-- no experience

24:54.692 --> 24:57.662
of the frontier t...

24:58.996 --> 25:00.799
to investigate...

25:02.300 --> 25:06.171
unrest on the frontier?

25:09.340 --> 25:10.509
Why...

25:12.577 --> 25:13.678
Why can't you just--

25:13.711 --> 25:17.048
Why can't you just leave, um...

25:17.081 --> 25:18.149
well enough...

25:19.984 --> 25:21.052
alone?

25:31.262 --> 25:32.731
[sighs]

25:46.978 --> 25:48.914
[horn blowing]

26:15.406 --> 26:16.908
Keep moving.

26:55.946 --> 26:57.916
[insects chirping]

27:11.062 --> 27:13.231
[knock on door]

27:13.264 --> 27:14.366
Star?

27:22.707 --> 27:24.342
[Star sighs]

27:24.375 --> 27:25.310
Come in.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.325
I thought you were one of them.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.996
They give me the shivers.

27:52.403 --> 27:53.938
Isn't he your friend?

27:56.941 --> 27:57.909
The one...

28:02.980 --> 28:04.416
[grunts]

28:07.384 --> 28:09.721
Can I fetch you
something to drink?

28:18.028 --> 28:18.963
No?

28:22.266 --> 28:24.769
Is there nothing
I can do for you?

28:55.199 --> 28:56.735
Something on your mind?

28:58.536 --> 28:59.771
Hmm.

29:07.878 --> 29:09.147
[sighs]

29:10.981 --> 29:12.350
They will soon be gone.

29:14.185 --> 29:16.020
Things will return to normal.

29:19.990 --> 29:22.127
I wish I could believe you.

29:24.895 --> 29:27.098
[hammering]

29:32.169 --> 29:34.139
[boys speaking local language]

29:49.620 --> 29:51.790
-[baby murmuring]
-[flies buzzing]

29:53.958 --> 29:55.794
Give them a shovel.

29:57.027 --> 29:59.464
Let them dig a latrine,
at least.

30:00.998 --> 30:02.534
[baby murmurs]

30:09.640 --> 30:12.844
Sir, Colonel Joll is-- is here.

30:20.918 --> 30:22.453
We will be leaving today.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.455
Sir.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.259
So soon?

30:28.292 --> 30:30.461
Yes, we have completed
our investigations.

30:30.494 --> 30:33.030
Now I must hurry back
and make my report.

30:33.063 --> 30:35.600
Anything I can do
to facilita--

30:35.633 --> 30:38.970
No, no. I believe we have
everything we came for.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.245
Cup of tea.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.515
And your inquiries, Colonel,

30:51.548 --> 30:53.451
among the nomad peoples...

30:55.452 --> 30:57.321
have they been successful?

30:57.354 --> 30:58.656
Yes.

30:58.689 --> 31:02.493
I think I can say
we've had some success,

31:02.526 --> 31:04.295
particularly when you consider

31:04.328 --> 31:07.065
that this is only part
of a great enterprise.

31:08.365 --> 31:10.534
Similar investigations
are being carried out

31:10.567 --> 31:13.971
elsewhere in the frontier
in a very coordinated fashion

31:14.004 --> 31:15.539
with the cooperation

31:15.572 --> 31:18.977
of the various
frontier administrators.

31:20.544 --> 31:22.213
Well, that is good.

31:26.116 --> 31:28.452
And is it too early to reveal

31:28.485 --> 31:34.425
whether we have anything to fear
from these barbarians this year?

31:36.360 --> 31:42.300
May we still sleep securely
in our beds?

31:42.333 --> 31:45.036
Since all is not well here--

31:45.069 --> 31:47.571
and by no stretch
of the imagination

31:47.604 --> 31:49.340
can we say
that all is well here

31:49.373 --> 31:52.543
in your little sliver
of the frontier...

31:56.513 --> 31:58.983
I expect further measures
will be taken.

32:43.260 --> 32:45.363
-I want everything cleaned up!
-Yes, sir.

32:45.396 --> 32:48.466
I want everything
as it was before at once!

32:48.499 --> 32:49.734
What are you doing?

32:49.767 --> 32:52.036
What are you doing?!
Let that woman go!

32:52.069 --> 32:53.571
Right. Sir.

32:55.572 --> 32:57.742
Let all these people go.
Let them go.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.410
Give them their things.
Let 'em go.

32:59.443 --> 33:01.445
You all go on.

33:01.478 --> 33:02.446
Go!

33:02.479 --> 33:03.647
[soldiers muttering]

33:03.680 --> 33:05.549
Out! Come on!

33:05.582 --> 33:07.585
-You heard what he said.
-What are you doing?

33:07.618 --> 33:09.387
I want-- I want these people
out of here!

33:09.420 --> 33:11.990
-Go on.
-Out of here right away!

33:13.257 --> 33:14.225
Go on! Go!

33:17.795 --> 33:19.130
I want them gone.

33:25.502 --> 33:27.438
[wind blowing]

34:05.809 --> 34:07.712
It's late to be out-of-doors.

34:27.130 --> 34:29.600
[wind blowing]

34:29.632 --> 34:31.502
Naim.

34:31.534 --> 34:32.837
[Naim] Sir?

[girl panting]

35:23.687 --> 35:25.223
[speaking local language]

35:32.796 --> 35:35.433
I can see.

35:46.710 --> 35:48.579
Please, sit down.

35:49.846 --> 35:50.781
[speaks local word]

36:00.824 --> 36:02.760
[breathing heavily]

36:15.572 --> 36:16.574
[sighs]

36:34.324 --> 36:35.693
Can you look at me?

36:38.428 --> 36:41.799
This is how I look.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.839
[wind blowing]

37:01.818 --> 37:03.221
Where do you live?

37:05.689 --> 37:06.791
I live.

37:08.825 --> 37:12.363
We do not permit vagrants
in the town.

37:13.430 --> 37:16.033
You must have somewhere to live.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.435
Otherwise, you must go
back to your own people.

37:18.468 --> 37:19.503
Do you understand?

37:25.075 --> 37:26.244
Well...

37:28.545 --> 37:31.749
I offer that you should...

37:32.816 --> 37:36.254
come and work here.

37:41.858 --> 37:45.630
Um, either that
or go back to your people.

37:47.364 --> 37:49.433
You cannot beg in the street.

37:49.466 --> 37:50.835
I cannot permit that.

37:52.469 --> 37:54.005
You must have a place to live.

37:56.573 --> 37:57.875
If you work here...

37:59.509 --> 38:02.446
you can sleep here, too.

38:12.989 --> 38:14.525
I can go?

38:15.926 --> 38:18.362
Yes, go if you want to.

38:27.838 --> 38:29.774
[breathing heavily]

38:50.160 --> 38:52.330
[soft chatter]

39:19.589 --> 39:21.459
Come. Come inside.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.966
[fire crackling]

39:32.469 --> 39:33.571
Let me see.

39:55.459 --> 39:57.862
They broke it.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.566
My, um...

40:02.599 --> 40:04.635
[speaks local word]

40:04.668 --> 40:05.769
Your ankle.

40:05.802 --> 40:06.971
My ankle.

40:09.172 --> 40:11.008
Other one, too.

41:19.009 --> 41:19.977

[birds chirping]

42:41.391 --> 42:43.561
[embers crackling]

43:19.729 --> 43:20.998
Welcome, sir.

43:21.031 --> 43:22.099
The Magistrate's waiting.

43:22.132 --> 43:23.601
-Thank you.
-Company, halt.

43:26.302 --> 43:27.605
Cheers.

43:32.842 --> 43:35.178
So no trouble
on the way here, then?

43:35.211 --> 43:36.346
Nothing.

43:36.379 --> 43:37.881
Nothing worth mentioning.

43:37.914 --> 43:40.851
I think we were followed
for a while by barbarians,

43:40.884 --> 43:41.952
but that was all.

43:41.985 --> 43:46.023
Are you sure
they were barbarians?

43:46.056 --> 43:48.626
[chuckles]
What else could they have been?

43:51.428 --> 43:53.063
At brigade headquarters,
they're saying

43:53.096 --> 43:54.398
there is to be
a general offensive

43:54.431 --> 43:56.400
against the barbarians
in the spring.

43:56.433 --> 44:00.337
The plan is to move them back
all along the frontier,

44:00.370 --> 44:02.105
back into the mountains.

44:02.138 --> 44:05.075
[laughs] They can't be serious.

44:05.108 --> 44:08.412
The people who-- whom you
call barbarians are nomads.

44:08.445 --> 44:10.347
They will never
permit themselves

44:10.380 --> 44:12.416
to be bottled up
in the mountains.

44:12.449 --> 44:15.385
Well, sorry to be frank.

44:15.418 --> 44:17.721
Isn't that what war is about?

44:19.456 --> 44:22.026
Compelling a choice on someone
who would not otherwise make it?

44:31.234 --> 44:32.236
Ah.

44:35.472 --> 44:36.707
Mm-hmm.

44:40.143 --> 44:43.414
Tell me, sir, as someone
who knows the region...

44:45.148 --> 44:47.418
why are these barbarians
so dissatisfied?

44:48.985 --> 44:50.754
What is all the trouble about?

44:53.523 --> 44:56.894
Well, what is the trouble about?

44:59.062 --> 45:02.266
Ahem. Well, there was no trouble
that-- that I know of...

45:03.500 --> 45:06.270
until outsiders
started interfering.

45:07.537 --> 45:09.372
We had peace.

45:09.405 --> 45:12.075
We kept to ourselves.
They kept to themselves.

45:12.108 --> 45:15.979
But it's-- it's all changed now.

45:17.413 --> 45:21.084
It will take years
to patch up the damage

45:21.117 --> 45:24.755
that Colonel Joll did
in the space of a week.

45:25.955 --> 45:27.424
[chuckles]

45:27.457 --> 45:28.525
[laughs] You smile,

45:28.558 --> 45:30.728
but, uh,
I'll tell you something.

45:32.462 --> 45:34.197
We, you and I,

45:34.230 --> 45:38.535
think of this country as ours,
as part of the Empire.

45:38.568 --> 45:42.472
We say to ourselves we reclaimed
the land from the desert,

45:42.505 --> 45:44.975
we planted it,
we built our homes here,

45:45.008 --> 45:46.810
but that's not how they see it.

45:46.843 --> 45:51.948
They still see us
as visitors, transients.

45:51.981 --> 45:55.352
They say to one another,
"Be patient.

45:55.385 --> 45:58.922
One day, these foreigners
will pack up and leave."

45:58.955 --> 46:01.492
[chuckles] "They will
never last in the desert."

46:03.359 --> 46:05.062
But we're not going to leave.

46:08.331 --> 46:09.266
No?

46:11.568 --> 46:13.303
Are you sure?

46:13.336 --> 46:16.406
The frontier towns are the first
line of defense of the Empire,

46:16.439 --> 46:20.110
so th-there's no question
of abandoning them.

46:24.547 --> 46:26.483
-[spoon scraping]
-[chewing]

47:15.498 --> 47:17.434

[soft crying]

47:58.207 --> 48:00.878
[Magistrate sighs]

48:16.292 --> 48:18.595
What do you think
they're doing up there?

48:18.628 --> 48:20.898
What do you think? The usual.

48:23.166 --> 48:25.369
Doesn't usually
bring girls up there.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.571
He's strict about that.

48:28.604 --> 48:30.107
Well, he's getting old.

48:31.641 --> 48:34.378
Ah, he's still
a very good-looking man.

48:35.411 --> 48:36.914
Have you got your eye on him?

48:38.114 --> 48:39.716
Have you got your eye on him,
Grandma?

48:39.749 --> 48:41.184
-[laughs]
-That's enough now.

48:41.217 --> 48:43.053
Come on. Bed.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.321
Oh! [laughs]

48:44.354 --> 48:46.123
That's it. Bedtime.

48:54.430 --> 48:56.366
[scrubbing]

49:00.036 --> 49:01.438
[tub clangs]

49:06.676 --> 49:08.378
-Towel.
-Huh? Towl.

49:08.411 --> 49:09.980
-Towel.
-Tow-- Towel.

49:10.013 --> 49:11.581
-Towel.
-Towel.

49:11.614 --> 49:12.649
Tow-el.

49:12.682 --> 49:13.650
Towel?

49:13.683 --> 49:15.151
-Towel.
-Towel.

49:15.184 --> 49:16.953
[laughing]

49:21.024 --> 49:22.492
Can you come up, please?

49:25.094 --> 49:26.162
Now?

49:26.195 --> 49:28.432
Yes. Yes, now, in a minute.

49:58.795 --> 50:01.999
Wh-What is that?

50:03.499 --> 50:05.435
It's where they touch me.

50:06.803 --> 50:08.338
Where they touched you?

50:12.442 --> 50:14.444
D-Does it hurt?

50:19.115 --> 50:20.717
What did they do to you?

50:24.420 --> 50:25.355
Tell me.

50:46.375 --> 50:48.345
[humming a melody]

51:08.898 --> 51:10.067
[humming ends]

51:17.140 --> 51:19.876
In his report,
Colonel Joll wrote

51:19.909 --> 51:24.514
that one of the prisoners
died afterwards.

51:25.748 --> 51:27.384
Do you remember that prisoner?

51:28.818 --> 51:32.656
Do you know what they
did to him, who he was?

51:33.723 --> 51:35.425
We heard he went crazy

51:35.458 --> 51:36.493
and attacked them.

51:38.828 --> 51:39.796
And?

51:42.865 --> 51:44.101
He attacked them.

51:46.402 --> 51:48.305
We had to take him out
afterwards.

51:49.338 --> 51:50.640
He was breathing strangely,

51:50.673 --> 51:53.176
very deep and very fast.

51:54.810 --> 51:56.480
Then he died the next day.

51:58.614 --> 52:01.351
He was the one they questioned
the longest, sir.

52:03.853 --> 52:05.489
He had someone with him?

52:07.456 --> 52:08.525
His daughter.

52:13.329 --> 52:14.498
His daughter.

52:16.832 --> 52:18.935
What happened to her?

52:18.968 --> 52:20.504
She was questioned, too.

52:21.571 --> 52:22.873
I heard her crying.

52:24.273 --> 52:25.475
She was in pain.

52:27.376 --> 52:29.146
They broke her feet, I think.

52:31.214 --> 52:33.716
Did they do that
in-- in front of him,

52:33.749 --> 52:35.385
in front of her father?

52:35.418 --> 52:36.786
Yes, sir.

52:39.655 --> 52:42.425
They did something
to her eyes, didn't they?

52:43.993 --> 52:46.663
Sir, there were a lot
of prisoners to take care of.

52:48.431 --> 52:50.400
I-I know she had
a bad time with her feet,

52:50.433 --> 52:51.902
but the eyes...

52:53.436 --> 52:55.338
we didn't know about that
'til later.

52:59.976 --> 53:01.912
[water splashing]

53:03.646 --> 53:04.915
You should have told me.

53:08.284 --> 53:10.187
You should tell me everything.

53:20.529 --> 53:21.798

53:55.998 --> 53:57.934
[breathing heavily]

54:26.662 --> 54:27.831
And this...

54:37.506 --> 54:38.775
It was a fork.

54:40.076 --> 54:41.678
Kind of fork.

54:44.714 --> 54:49.586
They put it in a fire
until it was hot.

54:53.022 --> 54:55.125
Then they touch me with it.

54:58.994 --> 55:00.830
They held my eyes open.

55:04.867 --> 55:07.504
They said they'd
burn my eyes out.

55:08.938 --> 55:12.575
After that,
I could not see anymore.

55:14.910 --> 55:17.047
I can see
around the edges, yes...

55:18.881 --> 55:20.717
but not in middle.

55:22.485 --> 55:23.787
There is blur.

55:49.111 --> 55:51.381
What do you feel

55:51.414 --> 55:53.750
towards the men
who did this to you?

55:59.622 --> 56:01.825
I'm tired of talking.

56:09.899 --> 56:11.835
[sniffling]

56:39.061 --> 56:41.564
You aren't happy
with me here, are you?

56:54.243 --> 56:58.448
You only have to say the word,
and I will take you back.

56:59.748 --> 57:01.151
Is that what you want?

57:05.955 --> 57:09.559
I can't promise to take you
back to your family.

57:09.592 --> 57:11.428
I don't know where they are.

57:13.229 --> 57:15.465
Do you want me to take you back?

57:24.106 --> 57:25.041
[sighs]

57:36.986 --> 57:37.921
Ready?

57:39.989 --> 57:40.924
Yes, sir.

57:42.958 --> 57:44.194
What are we waiting for, then?

57:46.962 --> 57:48.831
The girl is coming along.

57:48.864 --> 57:50.233
Was that your question?

57:50.266 --> 57:52.602
Yes, sir.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.170
We'll be gone
no more than a week,

57:54.203 --> 57:55.939
10 days at most.

Bring in the horses! Quickly!

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.173
That's a horse there!

before we...

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.604
Before we find
what we're looking for?

01:04:39.274 --> 01:04:40.309
Tomorrow?

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:43.913
The next day perhaps.

01:04:47.282 --> 01:04:49.151
Don't you know these parts, sir?

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:53.522
No, I've not been here before...

01:04:56.124 --> 01:04:57.260
not this far.

01:05:19.581 --> 01:05:21.517
[tapping wood]

01:05:51.279 --> 01:05:52.248
Sir.

01:05:53.548 --> 01:05:54.984
There's people ahead.

01:05:59.654 --> 01:06:00.589
Come.

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.642
There's no sign of them!

01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:22.344
They've gone, sir!

01:06:22.377 --> 01:06:24.480
No tracks?!

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:39.155
Then take my horse.

01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:45.194
Wait. Wait. Wait.
No. No, no, no, no.

01:07:47.295 --> 01:07:48.264
All right.

01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:51.534
Fetch the crutches.

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:56.371
Come down off here.

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:36.845
You must speak with them.

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:38.747
Tell them why we're here.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:39.881
Tell them your story.

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:42.751
I want you
to tell them the truth.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:48.224
You really want me to tell them?

01:08:52.327 --> 01:08:53.295
Well...

01:08:54.828 --> 01:08:56.365
tell them what you like.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:01.237
I have now done
what I said I would do.

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:04.640
Let me say what I...

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:08.577
what I want.

01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:11.647
What I want from my heart...

01:09:13.747 --> 01:09:17.153
is for you to come
to return to the town with me.

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:22.291
Of your own choice.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.461
I want you to come back with me.

01:09:28.263 --> 01:09:29.898
You understand?

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.800
This-- This is what I want.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.337
Why?

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:44.947

I have-- I have brought some...

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:21.317
gifts that I would
like you to have.

01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:36.498
Ask them if we may buy
one of their horses.

01:10:36.531 --> 01:10:38.334
Say I will pay in silver.

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:53.909
Silver is the-- for horse he
does not take away from you.

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:57.980
He does not take away my horse.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.617
He take silver instead.

Where are you taking me?

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.222
Go!

[footsteps pattering]

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:21.917
Why have I been kept waiting?

01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:25.521
What have you done with my men?

01:15:26.721 --> 01:15:28.957
Is there anything
I can help you with?

01:15:34.362 --> 01:15:36.932
May I speak with Colonel Joll?

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.902
Where have you been?

01:15:40.935 --> 01:15:43.305
I've been on a journey.

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:46.841
It pains me that I was not here
when you arrived

01:15:46.874 --> 01:15:49.010
to offer you hospitality.

01:15:49.043 --> 01:15:51.780
You've been treasonously
consorting with the enemy.

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:54.650
Do you deny it?

01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:58.820
We have no enemy
that I know of,

01:15:58.853 --> 01:16:01.123
unless we ourselves
are the enemy.

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:05.794
Who gave you permission
to leave your post?

01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:10.632
That is a private matter.

01:16:10.665 --> 01:16:12.634
You will have to take
my word for it.

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:15.870
I do not intend to discuss it.

01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:18.239
I would like to speak
with Colonel Joll.

01:16:18.272 --> 01:16:20.175
Colonel Joll's not here.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:24.679
Colonel Joll is out
conducting operations

01:16:24.712 --> 01:16:27.349
to correct the situation
that you've allowed to develop.

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:29.017

I'd like to read to you

01:16:32.787 --> 01:16:35.924
from some of the depositions
I have gathered

01:16:35.957 --> 01:16:37.993
since I arrived in this town...

01:16:39.894 --> 01:16:41.196
so you have some idea

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:43.732
of the gravity
of the charges against you.

01:16:47.435 --> 01:16:48.670

Not until we set off
was I told

01:17:46.961 --> 01:17:51.033
that a young barbarian woman
would be accompanying us.

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.471
And at no point was I warned

with the barbarians...

when we have to come

01:18:12.787 --> 01:18:14.723

the local administrations?

It isn't even our job.

I will defend myself
in a proper court of law.

Will you?

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:25.800
No one would dare
say those things to my face.

Kneel.

01:21:02.523 --> 01:21:03.925
Get on your knees.

01:21:09.363 --> 01:21:11.433
[grunting, moaning]

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.595
[charcoal scraping]

[prisoner groans]

[blows landing]

01:22:00.214 --> 01:22:02.317
[prisoners grunting]

01:22:08.422 --> 01:22:11.225
-Beat them!
-Come on! Beat the animals!

01:22:11.258 --> 01:22:12.460
Beat the animals!

01:22:12.493 --> 01:22:15.263
[crowd chattering]

01:22:15.296 --> 01:22:16.231
Beat him!

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:25.707
[crowd murmuring]

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.276
-[clapping]
-[chattering]

01:22:28.309 --> 01:22:29.411
That's the way.

01:22:38.152 --> 01:22:40.121
[clapping and cheering]

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:47.963
No.

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:51.032
No!

01:22:51.065 --> 01:22:54.002
No! No! No! No!

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:57.672
You! You are
depraving these people!

01:22:57.705 --> 01:22:59.007
You-- [groans]

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.276
[groans] No!

01:23:02.309 --> 01:23:04.345
[wincing]

01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:05.546
No! No!

01:23:05.579 --> 01:23:06.614
Wait! Wait!

01:23:06.647 --> 01:23:07.749
You broke--

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:09.150
Wait! Wait. Wait.

01:23:10.184 --> 01:23:11.453
You've broken my arm.

01:23:14.755 --> 01:23:15.690
Just wait.

01:23:18.325 --> 01:23:20.528
No, not with that,
not with that hammer.

01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:22.530
You would not use
a hammer on a beast.

01:23:22.563 --> 01:23:24.699
Look. These are men!

01:23:24.732 --> 01:23:26.067
Men!

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.068
[groans]

01:23:29.503 --> 01:23:30.438
[blow strikes]

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:33.208
[gurgling]

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:37.412
[door clangs]

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:39.381
[lock clicking]

01:23:42.349 --> 01:23:44.285
[panting]

01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:53.361
[chuckles]

01:23:56.430 --> 01:24:00.201
[girl humming a melody]

01:24:01.335 --> 01:24:03.304
[metal clinking]

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:24.059
[stops humming]

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.662
[Magistrate breathing raggedly]

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:53.621
Among the items
found in your apartment

01:24:53.654 --> 01:24:56.324
was this wooden chest.

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.259
Its contents are unusual.

01:24:59.793 --> 01:25:05.233
It contains approximately
300 slips of white poplar wood.

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.869
The surfaces are written on

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:10.538
in an unfamiliar script.

01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:14.342
Now, a reasonable inference

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.844
is that these slips
contain messages

01:25:16.877 --> 01:25:19.581
passed between yourself
and other parties.

01:25:20.881 --> 01:25:23.718
It remains for you to explain

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:27.488
from whom are the messages,

01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:30.425
to whom are the messages.

01:25:31.592 --> 01:25:32.527
Permit me.

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:47.142
I am sorry
I have to send bad news.

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:54.215
The soldiers came
and took your brother away.

01:25:54.248 --> 01:25:56.684
I have been to the fort
every day

01:25:56.717 --> 01:25:59.654
to plead for his return.

01:26:01.956 --> 01:26:05.893
Yesterday, they sent out
a man to speak with me.

01:26:05.926 --> 01:26:08.896
He says your brother
is no longer here.

01:26:08.929 --> 01:26:11.299
He says he has been ta--

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:14.702
he has been taken away.

01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:18.673
Do not tell your mother,

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:21.842
but join me in praying for him.

01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:25.680
Now, let-- let's see...

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:28.683
what this one says.

01:26:32.319 --> 01:26:34.889
Um, I went to fetch your--

01:26:34.922 --> 01:26:38.193
Ah. I went to fetch
your brother.

01:26:39.493 --> 01:26:43.798
They showed me into a room
where he lay

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:46.801
sewn up in a sheet.

01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:48.603
He--

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:53.274
Th-There were bruises
all over his body,

01:26:53.307 --> 01:26:57.245
and his feet were broken
and swollen.

01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:02.850
"What's happened to him?"
I asked the soldier.

01:27:02.883 --> 01:27:05.286
"I don't know," he said.

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:22.937
As you see,
it contains a single character.

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:25.439
It is the--
It is the character--

01:27:25.472 --> 01:27:28.709
barbarian character for "war."

01:27:28.742 --> 01:27:32.780
Although it can also stand
for "vengeance,"

01:27:32.813 --> 01:27:37.852
and if-- if you turn it
upside down like this,

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:39.420
it can mean...

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:41.723
"justice."

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.628
There's no way of knowing
in what sense it is intended.

01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:51.833
That is a part
of barbarian c-cunning.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.037
It's the same
with the rest of these.

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:59.440
Slips, they can be read
in many ways.

01:27:59.473 --> 01:28:02.043
They can be read
as a plan of war,

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:08.649
or they can read as a history
of the last years of the Empire.

01:28:08.682 --> 01:28:10.584
There's no knowing.

01:28:10.617 --> 01:28:11.719
Thank you.

01:28:19.993 --> 01:28:21.763
I'm finished.

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:29.036
You have no idea how tiresome
your behavior is.

01:28:29.069 --> 01:28:31.672
You are the only official
on the frontier

01:28:31.705 --> 01:28:34.942
from whom we have not had
the fullest cooperation.

01:28:36.677 --> 01:28:38.112
When I arrived back,

01:28:38.145 --> 01:28:42.583
I had decided that as soon
as I had the answers from you

01:28:42.616 --> 01:28:44.585
to a simple few questions...

01:28:45.919 --> 01:28:48.856
you would be free
to go back to your old life

01:28:48.889 --> 01:28:51.392
and your concubines.

01:28:53.794 --> 01:28:57.832
However, you seem
to have a new ambition.

01:28:59.566 --> 01:29:02.103
You want to make
a name for yourself

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:04.772
as the one just man.

01:29:04.805 --> 01:29:07.608
You are simply a clown.

01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:09.910
You are dirty.

01:29:09.943 --> 01:29:11.912
You stink.

01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:14.449
They can smell you a mile away.

01:29:15.849 --> 01:29:18.719
You want to get your name
into the history books,

01:29:18.752 --> 01:29:19.954
history.

01:29:22.022 --> 01:29:23.557
This is the border.

01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:25.860
This is nowhere.

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:27.462
There is no history here.

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.932
People are not interested

01:29:31.965 --> 01:29:36.103
in the history
of the back of beyond.

01:29:36.136 --> 01:29:37.705
We will end these troubles,

01:29:37.738 --> 01:29:39.640
we will put down the enemy,

01:29:39.673 --> 01:29:41.809
and that will be the end of it.

01:29:41.842 --> 01:29:42.910
The enemy?

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:47.782
These pitiable creatures
of yours,

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:51.118
are they the enemy
that I must fear, Colonel?

01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:54.522
No, you-- you are
the enemy, Colonel.

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.790
Nonsense.

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:58.526
You are an obscene torturer.

01:30:01.628 --> 01:30:04.899
You-- You deserve to be hanged.

01:30:08.135 --> 01:30:11.539
Now to business.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.076
I would like
a statement from you

01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:19.013
on everything that passed
between you and the barbarians

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:23.050
on your recent
and unauthorized visit.

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.525
We are waiting.

01:30:45.839 --> 01:30:47.675
I refuse.

01:30:50.544 --> 01:30:52.013
You refuse?

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:56.217
Very well.

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.553
Then our interview is over.

01:31:00.954 --> 01:31:02.056
He is yours.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.930
[Magistrate breathing heavily]

01:31:27.681 --> 01:31:29.884

[gasps]

01:32:28.041 --> 01:32:28.976

01:32:32.379 --> 01:32:33.548
Climb.

Climb.

01:32:39.052 --> 01:32:40.988
[gasping]

01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:51.298
And what do you
want to say to me?

01:32:51.331 --> 01:32:53.968
That-- That nothing passed

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:57.605
between the barbarians
and myself

01:32:57.638 --> 01:33:00.107
of a military nature.

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:02.676
It was a private affair.

01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:05.846
I returned the girl
to her people...

01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.316
nothing more.

01:33:10.017 --> 01:33:11.953
[wailing]

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.388
[wailing continues]

01:33:18.258 --> 01:33:19.193
[wailing stops]

01:34:01.034 --> 01:34:05.139
No chance of going in
to my apartments

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:07.007
just for a minute,

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.010
get a few of my things?

01:34:12.312 --> 01:34:13.781
Sir, I can't.

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.849
[chuckles]

01:34:15.882 --> 01:34:16.884
I really can't.

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.185
It's fine.

01:34:21.421 --> 01:34:24.391
Colonel Joll
and his expeditionary force

01:34:24.424 --> 01:34:29.863
have been out in the desert
for a long time, haven't they?

01:34:29.896 --> 01:34:31.265
Since when?

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:34.034
Since August, sir.

01:34:34.067 --> 01:34:35.336
August?

01:34:39.406 --> 01:34:41.242
You must be worried.

01:34:44.978 --> 01:34:46.747
[bird chirps]

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:49.183
[chuckles]

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:54.154
Well, one mustn't take
the barbarians lightly.

Your-- Your daughter's gone,

01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:29.223
leaving you with the boy?

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:31.926
Ah, he's no trouble.

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:37.364
[sighs]
So many people have left,

01:35:37.397 --> 01:35:39.233
-all my girls...
-[coins jingle]

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:41.202
your clerk, Naim.

01:35:42.235 --> 01:35:45.072
They took the east road.

01:35:45.105 --> 01:35:47.308
Just 'til it settles down,
they say.

01:35:51.511 --> 01:35:52.747
[chuckles]

01:35:58.018 --> 01:36:00.053
My rooms are empty.

01:36:00.086 --> 01:36:02.089
[chuckles]

01:36:02.122 --> 01:36:04.425
But they won't let me in.

01:36:10.897 --> 01:36:12.833
I'll find room for you.

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:20.241
You're an angel.

01:36:21.474 --> 01:36:22.810
[chuckles]

01:36:27.447 --> 01:36:29.116
You're always somewhere else.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.856
She would say the same thing...

01:36:37.924 --> 01:36:39.827
your barbarian girl.

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:44.498
She said you were
always somewhere else.

01:36:44.531 --> 01:36:46.967
She couldn't understand you.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.303
She didn't know
what you wanted from her.

01:36:54.908 --> 01:36:58.078
I didn't know
the two of you were intimate.

01:36:58.111 --> 01:36:59.814
Oh, we talked.

01:37:01.214 --> 01:37:06.554
Sometimes she used to cry
and cry and cry.

01:37:10.123 --> 01:37:13.027
What bird
has the heart to sing...

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.297
in a thicket of thorns?

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:21.035
Oh, no, it wasn't
what they did to her.

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.437
It was you.

01:37:25.205 --> 01:37:27.508
You made her very unhappy.

01:37:33.413 --> 01:37:34.982
Grandma.

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:39.854
I-I did?

01:37:43.957 --> 01:37:45.359
Yeah, didn't you know that?

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.196
Grandma.

01:38:01.541 --> 01:38:03.043
[door opens]

01:38:35.308 --> 01:38:36.643
-Ah.
-Yeah.

01:38:36.676 --> 01:38:38.646
-Why not?
-That's what I said to him.

01:38:43.149 --> 01:38:44.385
-[sighs]
-Your move.

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:46.453
-Drawing.
-Ah.

01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:50.624
[chuckles] So...

01:38:52.425 --> 01:38:54.028
Magistrate.

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:59.300
You're growing fat again.

01:39:01.301 --> 01:39:03.170
What happened to your work?

01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:11.245
I am a prisoner awaiting trial.

01:39:13.446 --> 01:39:15.682
Prisoners awaiting trial

01:39:15.715 --> 01:39:18.585
are not required
to work for their feed.

01:39:21.788 --> 01:39:23.390
That is the law.

01:39:24.424 --> 01:39:26.727
We have no record of you.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.128
H-How could you be a prisoner?

01:39:28.161 --> 01:39:29.663
Do we have a record of this man?

01:39:29.696 --> 01:39:31.532
No, sir, we don't.

01:39:32.799 --> 01:39:35.035
Then you must be a free man.

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:37.538
The gates are open.

01:39:38.705 --> 01:39:40.474
Go on. Leave if you wish.

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.648
Just-- Just a minute.

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:55.622
There's something that I would
like to know before I leave.

01:39:57.757 --> 01:40:01.128
Forgive me if the question
seems impudent.

01:40:02.362 --> 01:40:04.164
But I would like to ask...

01:40:07.734 --> 01:40:10.537
how do you eat afterwards?

01:40:12.739 --> 01:40:14.174
After you've been...

01:40:16.376 --> 01:40:18.479
working with people?

01:40:24.284 --> 01:40:26.620
[laughing]

01:40:30.123 --> 01:40:31.392
I'm sincere.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.695
-[sighs]
-Do you--

01:40:35.728 --> 01:40:40.167
Do you find it easy
to take food afterwards?

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.670
I would imagine
one wants to wash one's hands,

01:40:43.703 --> 01:40:45.472
to-- to clean off the blood,

01:40:45.505 --> 01:40:47.808
but to sit with one's
family and friends,

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:49.109
eat--

01:40:49.142 --> 01:40:50.744
Get out of here.

01:40:52.412 --> 01:40:54.681
Get out of here,
you fucking old lunatic.

01:40:54.714 --> 01:40:56.150
Get out!

01:40:57.584 --> 01:41:00.721
Go and die somewhere,
you fucking traitor.

01:41:01.788 --> 01:41:04.558
[horn blowing]

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.799
[crowd murmuring]

01:41:44.597 --> 01:41:46.667
-[flies buzzing]
-[crowd gasping]

01:41:49.836 --> 01:41:51.772
[crowd murmuring]

01:41:58.478 --> 01:42:00.447
[flies buzzing]

01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:11.859
"This withdrawal will be
only a temporary measure.

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.363
Caretaker force will remain

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:19.500
which will be adequate
for all routine duties.

01:42:21.634 --> 01:42:24.471
Relevant orders are given
on imperial authority

01:42:24.504 --> 01:42:27.908
and are part of a general
scaling down of operations

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:31.145
along the frontier
for the duration of the winter."

01:42:33.746 --> 01:42:34.681
Thank you all...

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:39.419
for your unforgettable
hospitality.

01:43:09.682 --> 01:43:11.652
-[gunfire]
-[screaming]

01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:19.526
Okay, let's go!

01:43:19.559 --> 01:43:21.294
That's the last of the grain!

01:43:21.327 --> 01:43:22.296
[gunshot]

01:43:23.329 --> 01:43:25.299
[bleating]

01:43:26.799 --> 01:43:28.668
Bring her! Come on!

01:43:28.701 --> 01:43:30.270
This way!

01:43:30.303 --> 01:43:31.738
-Get back!
-Get in here.

01:43:31.771 --> 01:43:34.841
-Get back, or I'll shoot!
-[horse neighs]

01:43:34.874 --> 01:43:35.943
Hah! Hah!

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.946
[bleating]

01:43:41.314 --> 01:43:42.716
Get off!

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.685
[crowd quiets]

01:44:13.813 --> 01:44:15.749
[birds chirping]

01:44:37.737 --> 01:44:39.739
Officer Mandel!

01:44:39.772 --> 01:44:41.942
[running footsteps]

01:44:44.777 --> 01:44:45.912
Where is Officer Mandel?

01:44:46.979 --> 01:44:48.815
We must have fresh horses.

01:44:48.848 --> 01:44:50.583
Who needs horses?

01:44:50.616 --> 01:44:52.886
The Colonel.
We-- We need fresh horses.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:56.356
Is he here?

01:44:56.389 --> 01:44:58.525
We need fresh horses.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.796
There are no horses.

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:04.464
There's nothing.

01:45:06.632 --> 01:45:08.068
Oh.

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:10.003
-Ch-Check that way.
-Okay.

01:45:12.505 --> 01:45:14.474
[running footsteps]

01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:52.045
[running footsteps]

01:46:00.453 --> 01:46:01.722
[running footsteps]

01:46:03.756 --> 01:46:04.825
We need to hurry, sir!

01:46:07.693 --> 01:46:10.797
[rocks thumping]

01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:12.799
-[driver] Hah! Hah!
-[reins snap]

01:46:19.038 --> 01:46:19.973
Hah!

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:29.649
[running footsteps]

01:47:02.715 --> 01:47:04.684
[boys laughing]

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.801
[soft chatter]

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:41.588
[children chattering]

01:48:19.225 --> 01:48:20.827

01:48:39.278 --> 01:48:41.214
