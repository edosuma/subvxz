00:00.232 --> 00:02.178
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.244 --> 00:04.146
The president has had a stroke.

00:04.213 --> 00:08.317
This is not the time for a woman
as the leader of the free world.

00:08.384 --> 00:11.120
I'm going out, and I am
going to take the oath of office.

00:11.187 --> 00:13.088
I want you to be my chief of staff.

00:13.155 --> 00:15.925
Make me a part of this administration,
or it won't work.

00:15.991 --> 00:18.194
Professionally or personally.

00:18.260 --> 00:20.062
I'm moving Rod into the West Wing.

00:20.129 --> 00:22.031
Quite a deal
the American people got.

00:22.097 --> 00:23.866
Two for the price of one.

00:23.933 --> 00:27.469
- Let me introduce Richard McDonald.
- Will you run for re-election?

00:27.536 --> 00:29.104
It won't be easy if she runs.

00:29.171 --> 00:32.741
It's not just the election. This could
be the next ten years of our lives.

00:32.808 --> 00:35.878
- [Templeton] What do you think?
- She's digging her own grave.

00:35.945 --> 00:38.814
Tomorrow's papers will be full
of attacking editorials.

00:38.881 --> 00:42.284
You want to be president because
you want to control the universe.

00:42.351 --> 00:44.920
- That's not me.
- Well, that's the problem!

00:48.123 --> 00:50.459
The Constitution makes us

00:50.526 --> 00:52.761
not rivals for power,

00:52.828 --> 00:55.197
but partners for progress.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.634
We are all trustees
for the American people.

00:58.701 --> 01:01.337
Custodians of
the American heritage.

01:01.403 --> 01:05.941
It is my task to report
the state of the union.

01:06.008 --> 01:09.278
To improve it
is the task of us all.

01:09.345 --> 01:11.213
[applause]

01:11.280 --> 01:14.416
[Lyndon Johnson]
A president's hardest task

01:14.483 --> 01:17.253
is not to do what is right,

01:17.319 --> 01:21.023
but to know what is right.

01:21.090 --> 01:23.125
[Richard Nixon] I see a new America.

01:23.192 --> 01:27.196
I see an America in which we
have abolished hunger.

01:27.263 --> 01:29.832
I see an America in which
we've made great strides

01:29.898 --> 01:32.101
in stopping the pollution of our air,

01:32.167 --> 01:35.437
cleaning up our water,
and most important,

01:35.504 --> 01:40.309
I see an America at peace
with all the nations of the world.

01:40.442 --> 01:43.746
[Gerald Ford] Only from a position
of strength can we negotiate

01:43.812 --> 01:48.284
a balanced agreement to limit
the growth of nuclear arms.

01:48.350 --> 01:52.221
Only a balanced agreement
will serve our interests

01:52.288 --> 01:54.456
and minimize the threat

01:54.523 --> 01:57.126
of nuclear confrontation.

01:57.192 --> 01:59.395
[Jimmy Carter] Our problems
are too complex

01:59.461 --> 02:03.132
for simple slogans
or for quick solutions.

02:03.198 --> 02:08.169
We cannot solve them
without effort and sacrifice.

02:08.237 --> 02:10.906
[Ronald Reagan] Let us
so conduct ourselves

02:10.973 --> 02:13.142
that two centuries from now,

02:13.208 --> 02:16.145
another Congress
and another president

02:16.211 --> 02:18.580
meeting in this chamber
as we're meeting,

02:18.647 --> 02:22.351
will speak of us with pride,

02:22.418 --> 02:25.087
saying that we met the test

02:25.154 --> 02:28.457
and preserved for them,
in their day,

02:28.524 --> 02:30.359
the sacred flame of liberty.

02:30.426 --> 02:34.029
This last best hope
of man on Earth.

02:34.096 --> 02:35.864
God bless you and thank you.

02:35.931 --> 02:38.067
[applause]

02:41.837 --> 02:44.239
[people chattering]

02:44.306 --> 02:47.209
- Mr. Calloway.
- Hello.

02:47.276 --> 02:49.144
[woman] Will the president join you?

02:51.413 --> 02:54.717
I must say, I do respect
the president on this one.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.820
- It's not a done deal.
- We've done our own head count.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.090
The president's homeless initiative
will be law by week's end.

03:01.156 --> 03:04.593
The president spending
political capital on the homeless,

03:04.660 --> 03:07.830
over at headquarters,
we have a word for people like that.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.632
Democrats.
Got the chairman right here.

03:10.699 --> 03:13.769
Raise your right hand and swear,
she's got our nomination.

03:13.836 --> 03:15.971
She's comfortable as an Independent.

03:16.038 --> 03:19.408
When's the last time an Independent
got elected outside of Vermont?

03:19.475 --> 03:22.244
Rod, meet the future
of the Democratic party,

03:22.311 --> 03:24.513
- Courtney Winters.
- It's a pleasure.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.715
By that, he means
the girl who makes copies

03:26.782 --> 03:30.252
of The Note and The Hotline
for the senior staff.

03:30.319 --> 03:34.356
Courtney, could you grab me a glass?
And one for our closet Democrat here.

03:36.525 --> 03:38.660
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

03:38.727 --> 03:39.962
Cheers.

03:40.028 --> 03:43.832
Two hundred and forty-eight, gentleman.
According to an in-house count,

03:43.899 --> 03:48.170
that's the number
of electoral votes I have today.

03:48.237 --> 03:51.106
We need 271 to get the White House.

03:51.173 --> 03:52.808
So do the Democrats.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.778
So does our incumbent president.

03:55.844 --> 03:59.882
- I don't follow.
- Well, in a three-way race,

03:59.948 --> 04:02.017
where do you
think it all ends up?

04:03.085 --> 04:05.454
The House of Representatives.

04:05.521 --> 04:09.792
Where I do believe
I will get a favorable ruling.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.128
I'd rather lead
with my homeless initiative,

04:13.195 --> 04:15.197
set the tone
with a bipartisan victory.

04:15.264 --> 04:18.834
- Might be counting your chickens.
- Latest count looks good for passage.

04:18.901 --> 04:22.871
- Both sides want points for the issue.
- More reason to shine a light on it.

04:22.938 --> 04:27.342
Neither party can afford to dismiss the
problem, and the public wants it fixed.

04:27.409 --> 04:29.812
Does the initiative
match the address' theme?

04:29.878 --> 04:32.414
The courage to act if the
easy choice is voting yes.

04:32.481 --> 04:37.319
They'll need courage to get behind my
proposal to curb nuclear proliferation.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.388
Oh, speaking of which,
I found a quote.

04:39.455 --> 04:42.691
The director of
the IAEA once said,

04:42.758 --> 04:46.028
"There are some who continue
to dangle a cigarette from their mouth

04:46.094 --> 04:48.530
and tell everybody else
not to smoke."

04:48.597 --> 04:52.134
- It's perfect. Put it in.
- You're already at 6,000 words.

04:52.201 --> 04:55.070
Well, that reminds me.
I want to move up the section on

04:55.137 --> 04:57.072
raising the minimum wage.

04:57.139 --> 05:00.442
If I'm calling on Congress to
immediately increase it a dollar,

05:00.509 --> 05:02.611
I want to do it
while they're still awake.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.483
Thank you. Thanks.

05:07.549 --> 05:10.352
- Hey, Rod.
- Dickie, hey, my man.

05:10.419 --> 05:12.588
- Uh... You have a good night?
- Yeah. Fine.

05:12.654 --> 05:15.324
- Great. Great.
- Need some help?

05:15.390 --> 05:18.594
- No. No, I'm, uh... I'm good.
- OK.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.762
All right.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.036
Hey. You're not leaving, are you?

05:28.103 --> 05:30.706
- Yeah. I'm parked down the block.
- Oh.

05:30.772 --> 05:33.408
- I don't suppose you valeted.
- Mmm. No. Sorry.

05:33.475 --> 05:35.344
This is my ride right here.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.679
- It's freezing.
- Yep.

05:37.746 --> 05:40.682
- Almost taste the Potomac, you know?
- Yeah.

05:41.283 --> 05:42.951
- Oh! Uh...
- [grunts]

05:48.557 --> 05:51.326
[groans] Man, I've got
such a headache.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.428
I'm not surprised.

05:54.096 --> 05:56.265
What's going on?

05:59.101 --> 06:01.537
What the hell is this?

06:02.204 --> 06:05.107
Slow news day, apparently.

06:07.109 --> 06:09.912
Oh, come on. This is nuts.
You know that.

06:09.978 --> 06:13.749
If it were the tabloids, maybe we
could assume it was Photoshopped.

06:13.815 --> 06:16.752
This is unbelievable.

06:16.818 --> 06:20.822
Unbelievable. I lose my balance, and
they do this? They gotta be desperate!

06:20.889 --> 06:24.026
Are we talking about the same
"they" who got you drunk last night?

06:24.092 --> 06:27.696
[sighs] I wasn't drunk.
I had one glass of champagne.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.598
- I barely drink.
- 'Morning.

06:29.665 --> 06:32.868
'Cause I'd imagine an expression
like that'd be hard to fake.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.704
[Rod] I was tired. I don't know.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.373
I skipped dinner.
Maybe it went to my head a bit.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.343
- Look, it wasn't that big of a deal.
- It's a big deal now.

06:45.247 --> 06:48.984
Honey. It was
an opportunistic distortion.

06:49.051 --> 06:52.588
I... I stood up. She turned
around, and I found myself...

06:52.654 --> 06:55.724
- Touching her breasts. I can see that.
- You're kidding me.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.426
- Oh, my God.
- About what?

06:57.492 --> 07:00.796
- What? You honestly think I'm...
- This is absolutely ridiculous.

07:00.862 --> 07:03.298
All a reporter has to say is "intern."

07:03.365 --> 07:06.201
- Rod would never do that!
- [Rod] I lost my footing!

07:06.268 --> 07:08.337
- Mom, do you mind?
- [Rod] This is some...

07:08.403 --> 07:11.907
That you were willing to drink
in public makes you vulnerable.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.542
You guys seriously fighting?

07:17.813 --> 07:20.215
Wait, is this for real?

07:20.282 --> 07:23.385
It's not. I tripped,

07:23.452 --> 07:25.687
and someone snapped a photo.

07:25.754 --> 07:29.057
Uh... let's eat breakfast
in the family room.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.562
Here, baby. Take that.

07:36.965 --> 07:39.001
This is not my fault.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.055
[horn honking]

08:02.624 --> 08:04.593
"Intern redux."

08:04.660 --> 08:07.262
That's almost literary.

08:07.763 --> 08:10.532
Somebody's read Updike.

08:10.599 --> 08:13.735
Is the first gentleman a gentleman?
That comes in many versions.

08:13.802 --> 08:16.605
Would've been more fun if
they caught him in the back seat

08:16.672 --> 08:19.708
of the presidential limo
with a hooker, but hey,

08:19.775 --> 08:22.744
he's managed
to humiliate the president,

08:22.811 --> 08:25.013
and that's all that counts. Right?

08:25.080 --> 08:28.417
And pushed her homeless bill
right off the front page.

08:28.483 --> 08:31.253
- Head count holding steady?
- It'll pass both houses.

08:32.254 --> 08:35.791
The photo was taken from an angle
that appeared as if Mr. Calloway's hand

08:35.857 --> 08:39.126
- touched her inappropriately.
- You saying he didn't touch her?

08:39.193 --> 08:43.597
He had no intention of touching her.
He tripped and caught his balance.

08:43.664 --> 08:45.434
- [all] Kelly!
- Uh, yeah, Jim.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.270
Kelly, how much had he had
to drink when he tripped?

08:48.336 --> 08:50.338
He had one glass of champagne, Jim.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.208
He had not eaten dinner.
He was not intoxicated.

08:53.275 --> 08:55.777
- [all] Kelly! Kelly! Kelly!
- Yes.

08:55.844 --> 08:59.014
Are you aware The Post is carrying
an interview with Miss Winters

08:59.081 --> 09:03.018
in which she says, quote, "Mr. Calloway
was drunk as a skunk," unquote.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.619
I've answered that question.

09:04.686 --> 09:07.556
And caused her mental distress
by fondling her.

09:07.622 --> 09:08.623
[reports chatter]

09:09.758 --> 09:13.462
It's one way to sell newspapers.
I'll be sure to read it, I love fiction.

09:14.429 --> 09:18.400
A rider just got annexed to the homeless
bill. An appropriations amendment.

09:18.467 --> 09:21.403
- Appropriations for what?
- Prison construction.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.238
To pump up the war on drugs.

09:23.305 --> 09:26.775
My bill is about
families, housing, jobs.

09:26.842 --> 09:29.578
It has nothing to do with prisons.
Who's the sponsor?

09:29.644 --> 09:32.714
Frank Devane, a two-term
Republican from Upper Michigan.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.750
A lot of clout for a two-termer.

09:34.816 --> 09:37.486
The speaker never misses
an opportunity to hurt you.

09:37.552 --> 09:39.988
Betting I won't veto my own bill.

09:40.055 --> 09:43.125
I refuse to let it be subverted
by a 35-year-old policy

09:43.191 --> 09:45.494
that's a total failure.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.197
We've built more prisons than schools.
It hasn't made a dent in drug use.

09:49.264 --> 09:53.502
Find out what we can do for Mr. Devane
to get him to withdraw the amendment.

09:53.568 --> 09:55.570
I'll go and talk to him.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.473
I can't spare you.
Your priority is the State of the Union.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.777
- Rod can do it.
- Under the circumstances...

10:01.843 --> 10:04.479
There are no circumstances.
There's a photo.

10:04.546 --> 10:07.949
He tripped and caught his balance.
But if he lays low today,

10:08.016 --> 10:10.719
he's gonna prove
he's as guilty as he looks.

10:11.753 --> 10:13.522
- How was the briefing?
- [sighs]

10:13.588 --> 10:18.426
I could take this binder, smash it
over your head if you want a sense.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.763
- It's a... a one-day story.
- It is a hell of a day to pick.

10:21.830 --> 10:25.066
We're days before the president
lays out her agenda for the year,

10:25.133 --> 10:28.837
all anyone cares about is how much
the first gentleman had to drink.

10:28.904 --> 10:31.540
- It was one glass of champagne.
- Mr. Calloway.

10:31.606 --> 10:33.275
- I wasn't drunk.
- I'm sorry.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.811
Listen. I don't know what happened.

10:35.877 --> 10:37.979
I think I should
put out a statement.

10:38.046 --> 10:39.681
- Denying you were drunk?
- Mm-hm.

10:39.748 --> 10:43.084
Not a position of strength.
We've got more important business.

10:43.151 --> 10:45.821
The president needs you
on her homeless initiative.

10:45.887 --> 10:48.190
- The Devane rider?
- Yeah.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.392
We need to get that removed.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.627
It's all hands on deck.

10:53.495 --> 10:56.198
[Rod] Congressman,
let's be straight with each other.

10:56.264 --> 10:59.034
You waited until the president
had the pen in her hand

10:59.100 --> 11:01.603
to sign her homeless bill
before you loaded up on it.

11:01.670 --> 11:04.239
Gives the impression
you're looking for attention.

11:04.306 --> 11:07.209
I put some teeth in that bill,
Mr. Calloway.

11:07.275 --> 11:10.178
We have a homeless problem
because of the drug problem

11:10.245 --> 11:12.013
that made so many of them homeless.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.050
- Forty percent are children.
- With drug-using parents.

11:15.116 --> 11:17.953
- Not to stereotype.
- Tends to be accurate.

11:18.019 --> 11:21.323
This bill provides for the most
comprehensive drug treatment...

11:21.389 --> 11:24.492
Like rehab works? Come on.
I want roofs over these people too.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.529
But prisons get more people
off drugs than shelters.

11:27.596 --> 11:30.599
- It's the stick and the carrot.
- The president disagrees.

11:30.665 --> 11:33.935
And she is asking you to withdraw
the amendment, congressman.

11:38.039 --> 11:39.908
My constituents need to know

11:39.975 --> 11:43.078
I'm working hard on issues
that matter to them.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.915
Your numbers could use a bounce?

11:46.982 --> 11:48.717
Always true.

11:49.851 --> 11:52.621
The president wants to know
what she can do to help you.

11:55.490 --> 11:58.159
How many people can this shelter
hold on any given day?

11:58.226 --> 11:59.761
As many as come in that door.

11:59.828 --> 12:02.330
I've had people sleep
on the couch in my office.

12:02.397 --> 12:04.900
- 'Morning.
- Good morning, everyone.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.101
[all] Good morning.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.837
Madam President,
this is Lucinda Walker.

12:08.904 --> 12:12.173
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor, ma'am.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.808
Thank you.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.111
[sobs] I'm sorry.

12:16.177 --> 12:18.313
Oh, dear. That's OK.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.181
- [Lucinda] Sorry.
- [Mac] Thank you.

12:20.248 --> 12:22.817
This is
our financial assistance workshop.

12:22.884 --> 12:26.388
It's the last stop before guests
like Lucinda head back into the world.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.524
We help them
with bank accounts, health care.

12:29.591 --> 12:31.960
Well, I know you're gonna do just fine.

12:32.027 --> 12:34.629
Nice to meet you all.
Good luck.

12:34.696 --> 12:36.031
- Thank you.
- [laughs]

12:36.097 --> 12:38.199
[applause]

12:47.575 --> 12:50.245
We have been here
for 14 years now,

12:50.312 --> 12:54.482
but this has to stand out as
a red-letter day for D.C. Outreach.

12:54.549 --> 12:59.354
We are so grateful to you,
Madam President, for your support.

12:59.421 --> 13:01.656
- Ms. Clarke.
- [applause]

13:02.891 --> 13:07.028
But... don't thank me yet. Congress
still has to pass my initiative first.

13:07.095 --> 13:09.030
- [crowd chuckles]
- Madam President,

13:09.097 --> 13:12.634
with this morning's allegations,
is your husband a distraction

13:12.701 --> 13:14.602
for your administration?

13:14.669 --> 13:16.671
I'm not gonna let anything distract me

13:16.738 --> 13:19.407
from keeping the homeless
off the streets.

13:19.474 --> 13:22.377
My initiative reflects,
on a national scale,

13:22.444 --> 13:25.413
the step-by-step approach
so effectively demonstrated...

13:25.480 --> 13:28.249
Madam President, do your children
know about the photo?

13:28.316 --> 13:31.753
- Does he have a drinking problem?
- Will he sleep on the couch tonight?

13:36.658 --> 13:38.026
He may choose to.

13:38.093 --> 13:41.363
Because there hasn't been
a new mattress in there since Nixon.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.631
- [crowd laughs]
- Thank you.

13:53.241 --> 13:55.043
[knocking]

13:57.278 --> 13:58.980
Just got a call.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.449
The first gentleman
came up the Hill today.

14:01.516 --> 14:04.119
- To fetch a pail of water?
- [laughs]

14:04.185 --> 14:06.121
He paid Congressman Devane a visit.

14:06.187 --> 14:08.256
Of course he did.

14:08.323 --> 14:12.961
- Bloodied but unbowed.
- What do you suppose he offered him?

14:13.028 --> 14:17.732
Oh, I'd guess he blew some serious
presidential smoke up Devane's chimney.

14:17.799 --> 14:21.469
Promised him legislative support
down the road.

14:21.536 --> 14:23.638
A photo op with the president.

14:23.705 --> 14:24.773
[chuckles]

14:24.839 --> 14:27.409
Better stand on a box.

14:27.475 --> 14:30.879
President's six inches
taller than he is.

14:32.313 --> 14:36.584
Leading by example
requires the courage to act.

14:36.651 --> 14:39.654
After extensive talks
with the Joint Chiefs,

14:39.721 --> 14:42.791
the secretary of state
and my national security advisor,

14:42.857 --> 14:46.728
I have crafted a plan
to unilaterally destroy

14:46.795 --> 14:50.665
a significant portion of America's
nuclear warheads and materials.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.734
[Kate] Excuse me?

14:52.801 --> 14:56.171
I would like to exert
my maternal authority

14:56.237 --> 14:58.139
to remind you to eat.

14:58.206 --> 15:00.341
You are a sight for sore eyes.

15:00.408 --> 15:03.478
- Put your glasses back on.
- Thanks.

15:05.814 --> 15:07.916
[sighs]

15:07.982 --> 15:09.951
You've had a tough day, I know.

15:11.019 --> 15:13.588
- How you two doing?
- I don't know.

15:15.256 --> 15:18.259
You know what I remember most
about you and Dad?

15:18.326 --> 15:22.964
The kisses. He was always
coming in for the hug,

15:23.031 --> 15:25.100
always holding your hand.

15:25.166 --> 15:28.570
For the longest time,
I thought it was so silly.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.673
How did you do it?
How'd you manage it?

15:31.739 --> 15:34.843
Staying in love?

15:34.909 --> 15:37.278
[sighs] Easy.

15:38.179 --> 15:40.148
Mutual respect.

15:40.215 --> 15:42.183
Compromise.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.885
That and you remember that

15:43.952 --> 15:46.588
he spent half of every year

15:46.654 --> 15:49.290
on a ship in the Pacific.

15:50.191 --> 15:52.727
- Hmm.
- Eat.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.431
This too shall pass.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.933
[woman] Mr. Speaker?
Congressman Devane.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.936
I thought we had ourselves
an understanding.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.139
We did. I, um...

16:04.205 --> 16:07.175
- I didn't...
- You know, I've built a long career,

16:07.242 --> 16:10.979
some even say a...
a distinguished career,

16:11.045 --> 16:12.914
on one philosophy.

16:12.981 --> 16:16.818
You're either with me or... [laughs]

16:16.885 --> 16:19.354
...you're somewhere else.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.856
Are you somewhere else,
congressman?

16:21.923 --> 16:25.326
- I stand with the party.
- And the party supported your rider.

16:25.393 --> 16:28.863
Which was mutually beneficial.
I mean, the original goal...

16:28.930 --> 16:30.365
Is still the goal.

16:31.966 --> 16:34.836
Yes, but unfortunately,
I... I gave my word.

16:34.903 --> 16:37.038
To the town drunk, Frank.

16:37.105 --> 16:40.175
To the town drunk.

16:40.241 --> 16:43.845
Will you let an old man
give you a piece of advice?

16:44.646 --> 16:47.549
Never give up
a plum committee assignment

16:47.615 --> 16:51.286
for a photo op
and a pair of presidential cuff links.

16:52.220 --> 16:56.191
No. I... I'll call and cancel
my meeting with the president.

16:56.257 --> 17:00.228
No, no, no. She's a terrific woman.

17:00.295 --> 17:03.031
She admires directness.

17:03.097 --> 17:05.200
I know how much
she would appreciate

17:05.266 --> 17:08.703
the courtesy of you
telling her yourself.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.251
Homework?

17:23.318 --> 17:27.422
Working on the travel schedule
for after the State of the Union.

17:27.488 --> 17:29.123
Hmm.

17:29.190 --> 17:30.558
It's ironic.

17:30.625 --> 17:34.762
You make a speech with all
the pomp that the Capitol can offer,

17:34.829 --> 17:39.367
then you have to go out and
peddle the programs like Willy Loman.

17:41.336 --> 17:43.871
- You get the word about Devane?
- I did.

17:43.938 --> 17:47.475
It's good news. What did you
have to give him to drop the rider?

17:47.542 --> 17:50.345
Oh, just a photo op
with you in the Oval.

17:50.411 --> 17:53.114
Plus, you stop by his district
for a cup of coffee.

17:54.415 --> 17:57.819
Well, it's a big weight off.
Thank you.

18:00.989 --> 18:04.125
So any... any changes
in the scheduling?

18:04.192 --> 18:06.561
I'm adding a West Coast leg.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.198
L.A., San Francisco, maybe Seattle.

18:10.265 --> 18:13.635
So, what does that make it?
Like four days?

18:13.701 --> 18:16.671
That's a while to be
out of town, isn't it?

18:19.007 --> 18:22.710
Whatever it takes to get you
and Ms. Winters off the front page.

18:24.779 --> 18:27.382
Sure.

18:27.448 --> 18:30.285
Yeah. You're right.

18:30.351 --> 18:33.488
- It's a smart move.
- I don't want to fight anymore.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.324
Neither do I.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.739
Madam President.
How's the new draft?

18:51.806 --> 18:53.775
The staff's done
a great job with it.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.144
We're getting there.
We're getting closer.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.779
But...?

18:57.845 --> 19:01.883
For one thing, I'm...
I'm getting hung up on...

19:01.949 --> 19:03.718
I am the first female president,

19:03.785 --> 19:07.221
so do I talk about that, or do I
ignore it because it shouldn't matter?

19:07.288 --> 19:08.790
That's entirely up to you.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.093
- Anyway, the speech isn't there yet.
- [knocking]

19:12.160 --> 19:14.696
Hope we're not interrupting.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.398
Mac, Congressman Devane.

19:17.465 --> 19:19.667
Congressman, the president.

19:19.734 --> 19:21.836
- An honor to meet you, ma'am.
- Pleasure.

19:23.271 --> 19:25.073
- Mr. Gardner.
- How you doing, Frank?

19:25.139 --> 19:27.241
- Fine, fine.
- Please.

19:27.308 --> 19:29.010
Uh... yeah.

19:34.248 --> 19:36.951
So you're here to talk
about the initiative.

19:37.018 --> 19:40.688
And to invite you to visit
Upper Michigan's 14th District,

19:40.755 --> 19:43.691
in return for which,
Frank agreed to table the amendment.

19:43.758 --> 19:47.595
Wonderful. I can't tell you how
grateful I am to have this bill pass

19:47.662 --> 19:49.964
- in its original form.
- Actually,

19:50.031 --> 19:52.734
I haven't had the opportunity
to mention this,

19:52.800 --> 19:56.537
but I've been doing
some soul-searching and...

19:56.604 --> 19:59.107
- And what, Frank?
- [sighs]

19:59.173 --> 20:02.276
I've decided I can't, in good
conscience, reverse course.

20:02.343 --> 20:04.212
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. I...

20:04.278 --> 20:07.582
- I don't want to waste your time.
- You already have, congressman.

20:07.648 --> 20:10.118
Do I need to remind you
a president's endorsement

20:10.184 --> 20:13.654
of any future bill will almost
always guarantee its passage.

20:13.721 --> 20:16.257
Any other president
because he has party loyalty.

20:16.324 --> 20:17.759
But you don't have a party.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.228
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I should go.

20:20.294 --> 20:23.464
- Congressman, we had an agreement.
- I'm sorry. [clears throat]

20:26.267 --> 20:27.935
What the hell was that?

20:28.803 --> 20:32.774
[man] So Devane pulls the amendment, the
administration avoids its first veto.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.310
Or less cynically,
ushers a signature bill to passage.

20:36.377 --> 20:38.012
- [all] Kelly! Kelly!
- Steve.

20:38.079 --> 20:40.415
Devane's always banging
the war on drugs drum.

20:40.481 --> 20:42.617
How did she get
him to change his mind?

20:42.683 --> 20:45.153
She convinced him
that this so-called war

20:45.219 --> 20:47.655
needs to be fought
by other means and other bills.

20:47.722 --> 20:50.691
But let's let the
congressman tell you himself.

20:50.758 --> 20:52.894
- Good morning.
- [all] Good morning.

20:52.960 --> 20:57.198
I've just come from a meeting in
the Oval Office to discuss HR1468,

20:57.265 --> 21:00.101
known as
the president's homeless initiative.

21:00.168 --> 21:02.637
In that meeting,
the president asked that I

21:02.703 --> 21:05.206
reconsider the amendment
now attached to the bill,

21:05.273 --> 21:08.676
one that speaks to the correlation
between substance abuse,

21:08.743 --> 21:12.547
the lack of prison space
and homelessness.

21:12.613 --> 21:15.316
And while compelling
arguments had been made,

21:15.383 --> 21:18.052
I informed the president
that I would not

21:18.119 --> 21:21.789
alter, re-tool
or withdraw said amendment.

21:21.856 --> 21:23.324
- Congressman!
- Yes.

21:23.391 --> 21:26.360
How did the president respond
to your refusal to back down?

21:26.427 --> 21:29.864
- I imagine she was quite disappointed.
- [man] Sir!

21:29.931 --> 21:33.534
- Son of a bitch gave me his word.
- Which obviously wasn't worth much.

21:33.601 --> 21:37.004
Devane's wanted in on the
Appropriations Committee for four years.

21:37.071 --> 21:38.906
I guess the speaker found him a spot.

21:38.973 --> 21:42.510
I had him. He was on board. Templeton
must've come in at the 11th hour.

21:42.577 --> 21:44.378
Then why go through the motions?

21:44.445 --> 21:46.080
Why did Devane come to the Oval?

21:46.147 --> 21:48.416
So he could tell
the press corps himself.

21:48.483 --> 21:50.551
- Did he...?
- Yeah.

21:52.787 --> 21:55.790
In other words, the congressman
wasn't here to make a deal.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.125
He was here to make a scene.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.827
Somebody explain to me

21:59.894 --> 22:02.497
how we get the North Koreans
to stick to an agreement,

22:02.563 --> 22:06.234
but a two-term congressman can't
honor his word for more than 24 hours.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.636
Because we have no recourse, Mac.

22:08.703 --> 22:11.239
We have no allies. No infrastructure.

22:11.305 --> 22:15.376
I mean, we can't do anything
to keep him or anyone else in line.

22:17.678 --> 22:19.747
- Guys, we need a minute.
- Of course.

22:27.822 --> 22:30.525
- You can't talk to me like that.
- I can't tell the truth?

22:30.591 --> 22:32.426
It makes the staff uncomfortable.

22:32.493 --> 22:35.029
I didn't say anything
any of them wasn't thinking.

22:35.096 --> 22:37.265
It's not what you said,
it's how you said it.

22:37.331 --> 22:39.433
Oh, so now how I speak,
that's a problem.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.770
Listen, I am your husband,
and if I can't speak to you...

22:42.837 --> 22:45.540
That's the problem.
It's always been the problem.

22:49.010 --> 22:51.612
I have supported you.
I have worked for you.

22:51.679 --> 22:55.449
I backed you up your entire career.
I thought I brought something to the...

22:55.516 --> 22:59.954
This cannot continue to be seen
as an extension of our marriage.

23:01.923 --> 23:04.592
The lines are getting blurred, Rod.

23:19.407 --> 23:23.477
[Rebecca] I mean, have you
heard them fighting about it?

23:23.544 --> 23:25.746
No, it's just...

23:25.813 --> 23:29.016
...it feels weird around here,
with this intern thing going on.

23:29.083 --> 23:33.854
Yeah, well, maybe it wouldn't if Mom
would just cut Dad some slack.

23:33.921 --> 23:37.458
I mean, it's not like it hasn't been
totally blown out of proportion.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.261
Pretty big deal if you ask me.

23:41.329 --> 23:43.664
Yeah, well, he tripped, Horace.

23:43.731 --> 23:45.266
He had to have done something

23:45.333 --> 23:48.469
to end up so close to that
woman in the first place.

23:48.536 --> 23:52.106
- It was an accident.
- Yeah. I guess.

23:54.642 --> 23:58.212
- You think they're in trouble?
- Maybe.

23:59.347 --> 24:02.083
Yeah. Me too.

24:06.554 --> 24:09.123
[laughing, chattering]

24:10.958 --> 24:12.660
Jayne.

24:13.694 --> 24:16.397
I figured you'd head back
to the White House, so I

24:16.464 --> 24:19.433
ordered you a club soda
with, yes, two wedges of lime.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.370
Good memory. What's up?

24:22.436 --> 24:25.306
Speaker would like to know
if he's getting an advance copy

24:25.373 --> 24:28.576
- of the State of the Union.
- Uh, sorry, no.

24:28.643 --> 24:31.412
It's embargoed till she gives it.

24:31.479 --> 24:33.581
- We've gotten one before.
- Under Bridges.

24:33.648 --> 24:36.884
Same chief of staff.

24:36.951 --> 24:39.487
- Come on, Jim.
- We're up to, what, draft nine?

24:39.553 --> 24:41.856
I'm hoping we have
it ready for the president,

24:41.922 --> 24:43.924
let alone giving out
copies beforehand.

24:43.991 --> 24:47.528
Mm... all right.

24:47.595 --> 24:50.197
Well, still, it's gonna be a cold room.

24:50.264 --> 24:54.035
Lot of sitting on hands.
Lot of poker faces.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.604
I'll keep that in mind.

24:59.674 --> 25:01.809
[scoffs]

25:01.876 --> 25:04.278
So are you seeing anybody?

25:07.348 --> 25:09.116
I really have to get back.

25:10.618 --> 25:11.719
Thanks for the soda.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.223
Hey. How you doing?
Can I get a vodka tonic?

25:17.024 --> 25:19.293
- Um... Mr. Gardner?
- Yes?

25:19.360 --> 25:22.296
My name is Sherri Dalton.
I've been interning at the DNC,

25:22.363 --> 25:24.565
but I would like to move
to the White House.

25:24.632 --> 25:28.002
Contact our personnel office.
They'll tell you everything you need.

25:28.069 --> 25:30.204
Actually, sir, I've already done that.

25:30.271 --> 25:32.606
I thought if I could get
your recommendation...

25:32.673 --> 25:36.410
You should know there's a fine line
between assertive and inappropriate.

25:36.477 --> 25:39.947
I wouldn't have said anything
if I didn't have something to trade.

25:40.014 --> 25:42.149
I have information.

25:42.216 --> 25:44.485
- I'm sure you do.
- No, really.

25:44.552 --> 25:47.088
This whole thing
with the first gentleman,

25:47.154 --> 25:49.657
- I know who did it.
- Did what?

25:49.724 --> 25:52.059
Spiked his drink.

25:58.666 --> 26:00.935
Speaker's here, ma'am.

26:04.071 --> 26:08.309
It's good to see you.
Lot of anticipation about that.

26:08.375 --> 26:11.812
- Is there?
- Oh, sure. It's the State of the Union.

26:11.879 --> 26:15.816
The yardstick against which presidents
set themselves to be measured.

26:15.883 --> 26:18.819
It's always illuminating.

26:20.221 --> 26:23.324
I hope you'll do us a favor
and keep it under an hour.

26:24.158 --> 26:27.728
The sciatica you get
sitting in the House is murderous.

26:27.795 --> 26:31.866
[chuckles] I'll do my level best.

26:31.932 --> 26:35.870
I take it you've seen
your colleague's press conference.

26:35.936 --> 26:40.207
[exhales] On White House grounds.
No class.

26:40.274 --> 26:42.810
Vulgar, really vulgar.

26:42.877 --> 26:44.512
I'm going to speak to him about it.

26:44.578 --> 26:49.850
Conversing with a low-level
congressperson twice in as many days?

26:49.917 --> 26:51.485
That's not like you, Nathan.

26:51.552 --> 26:53.721
I talk to everybody
who needs talking to.

26:53.788 --> 26:57.158
Five times a day if I have to.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.393
Gotta run a tight ship.

27:00.494 --> 27:04.665
I have no intention of perpetuating
the status quo of a failed policy.

27:04.732 --> 27:08.803
Well, that's where we differ from you.

27:08.869 --> 27:12.239
And when I say we, I mean me...

27:12.306 --> 27:16.844
...and every president who's come
before you since Richard Nixon.

27:16.911 --> 27:19.580
The war on drugs
must not be abandoned.

27:20.447 --> 27:22.850
Drugs are at the very heart of what's

27:22.917 --> 27:25.352
eating away at our society

27:25.419 --> 27:28.489
and part and parcel
of what you call a failed policy

27:28.556 --> 27:31.392
is a lack of prison space
for drug offenders.

27:31.458 --> 27:35.262
And I'm all for addressing the problem,
just not as part of my initiative.

27:36.430 --> 27:38.732
Let me... let me say something to you.

27:38.799 --> 27:42.503
And I say it with all sincerity.

27:42.570 --> 27:46.273
Your bill is a good bill.

27:47.341 --> 27:51.445
And with this one small concession...

27:51.512 --> 27:53.681
...it'll pass the House.

27:54.648 --> 27:57.585
A concession that has
nothing to do with the issue

27:57.651 --> 27:59.520
and costs more
than the bill itself.

27:59.587 --> 28:03.324
- Politics is compromise. You know that.
- This is not compromise.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.327
This is a hijacking.
I refuse to give in.

28:08.863 --> 28:12.433
Is he on the Appropriations
Committee now? Mr. Devane?

28:12.499 --> 28:15.870
I had heard words to that effect, yes.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.240
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

28:22.176 --> 28:23.811
I look forward to it.

28:24.778 --> 28:28.215
Be good to have you
in our neck of the woods for a change.

28:31.952 --> 28:34.588
So, what was it?
Some kind of a liquid tranquilizer?

28:34.655 --> 28:36.724
Muscle relaxant. Ketamine, she thinks.

28:36.790 --> 28:39.860
She's promised to testify
to that in exchange for a job.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.563
- And this source of yours is...
- Volunteers at the DNC

28:42.630 --> 28:46.834
along with this other intern,
Courtney Winters. They're best friends.

28:46.901 --> 28:48.736
In the Washington sense of the word.

28:48.802 --> 28:52.106
Is this what it's come to?
Spiking the first gentleman's drink?

28:52.172 --> 28:55.342
It's just the beginning.
Mackenzie Allen scares the Democrats.

28:55.409 --> 28:58.445
[Kelly] What happened to
"the enemy of my enemy is my friend"?

28:58.512 --> 29:00.347
Democrats know in a three-way race,

29:00.414 --> 29:03.350
they get 25 percent on the left,
Templeton, 25 on the right,

29:03.417 --> 29:06.387
the president will get the middle 50
and sail to victory.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.355
Dems only shot is to take her out.

29:08.422 --> 29:11.792
Yeah, but why attack Rod? Just
to score some cheap political points?

29:11.859 --> 29:14.428
To dominate headlines
before her State of the Union.

29:14.495 --> 29:17.698
Knocking me down a peg
knocks her down by proxy.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.936
You want to get the Service?
Press charges?

29:22.002 --> 29:24.371
Yeah. Yeah. And I want
to talk to this girl.

29:24.438 --> 29:26.774
[Dickie] Her lawyer's talking
about a lawsuit.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.677
Last thing you need is more contact.

29:30.978 --> 29:34.515
- I'll do the talking this time.
- What about the president?

29:34.581 --> 29:37.785
- Should we...?
- Yeah. Tell her.

29:41.689 --> 29:44.224
- [knocking]
- [door opens]

29:44.291 --> 29:46.894
Mr. Gardner. Courtney Winters.

29:48.562 --> 29:50.497
Close the door, Vince, would you?

29:50.564 --> 29:52.833
I'll be outside if you need anything.

30:02.743 --> 30:04.511
So you wanted to see me?

30:07.147 --> 30:09.183
Do you have aspirations, Miss Winters?

30:09.917 --> 30:10.951
Pardon me?

30:13.087 --> 30:14.888
Political aspirations.

30:14.955 --> 30:18.158
- Uh, I was hoping to...
- We're talking about felonies here.

30:18.225 --> 30:19.994
- Excuse me?
- That's a problem.

30:20.060 --> 30:23.364
Not only will you never vote again,
but you'll likely do time.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.500
For what? I was groped,
and there's proof.

30:26.567 --> 30:30.070
Possession and delivery
of a controlled substance,

30:30.137 --> 30:33.007
conspiracy to threaten
the first gentleman, assault.

30:33.073 --> 30:36.377
- I don't need to listen to this.
- Sit down!

30:41.348 --> 30:45.352
I can pick up the phone
and have you arrested right now.

30:45.419 --> 30:47.788
How old are you?

30:48.956 --> 30:51.959
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two.

30:52.026 --> 30:54.261
They're gonna let you go to jail.

30:54.328 --> 30:56.096
Your superiors. Know that.

30:58.265 --> 31:00.534
If you give me a name,

31:00.601 --> 31:04.505
your career in politics may be over,
but you'll be able to walk out of here.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.148
[sighs]

31:14.214 --> 31:16.884
[clock chimes]

31:16.950 --> 31:18.385
Hey.

31:18.452 --> 31:20.621
I was just gonna say
good night to the kids.

31:20.687 --> 31:23.891
Well, I'll walk with you.

31:27.127 --> 31:29.763
I heard.

31:29.830 --> 31:32.666
About the Democratic operative.

31:32.733 --> 31:35.135
I'm not sure of the details
or how high it goes.

31:35.202 --> 31:36.670
Doesn't matter.

31:36.737 --> 31:38.772
Hey.

31:40.741 --> 31:44.111
I never set out to hurt you, Mac.

31:44.178 --> 31:47.414
- Ever.
- I know.

31:47.481 --> 31:49.917
I'm sorry too.

31:53.153 --> 31:54.955
Mm.

31:56.990 --> 31:59.960
- Well, uh, I've got an appointment.
- OK.

32:00.027 --> 32:02.463
- Kiss the kids good night for me?
- Yeah.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.631
All right.

32:05.566 --> 32:08.469
[Rebecca] Shh, shh.
Hey, Amy. Amy, it's OK.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.938
It's OK. I promise.
You don't have to cry.

32:11.004 --> 32:13.740
- Everything is going to be...
- Baby, what's wrong?

32:15.008 --> 32:17.244
Nothing, she just heard some things.

32:17.311 --> 32:18.812
What kind of things?

32:18.879 --> 32:21.882
You and Daddy are getting a divorce.

32:21.949 --> 32:25.519
Oh, baby, why in the world
would you think that?

32:25.586 --> 32:27.287
Horace and Becca said.

32:27.354 --> 32:29.957
Um... no, we didn't.

32:30.023 --> 32:32.626
Um, Amy just kinda heard us talking.

32:32.693 --> 32:34.228
Amy. Listen to me.

32:34.294 --> 32:35.963
All of you.

32:36.029 --> 32:37.698
Mommy and Daddy are fine.

32:37.764 --> 32:39.133
We just...

32:39.199 --> 32:42.503
Sometimes people argue, that's all.

32:42.569 --> 32:46.640
But you never argued as much as you
have since we've been here.

32:48.342 --> 32:51.845
- Oh, baby. I'm sorry.
- [Amy sniffling]

32:54.781 --> 32:57.284
[man] We need to find
a better candidate.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.086
Sir. Mr. Calloway.

32:59.153 --> 33:00.888
- Let me call you back.
- Sir?

33:02.923 --> 33:06.260
Membership registration is
on the first floor by the elevator.

33:06.326 --> 33:08.395
We've been friends a long time.

33:08.462 --> 33:10.998
I'd like to think you had
nothing to do with this.

33:11.064 --> 33:13.000
- What are you talk...?
- I was set up.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.302
Your political director masterminded it.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.604
I have no idea what
you're talking about...

33:17.671 --> 33:18.739
Richard Laughlin.

33:18.805 --> 33:21.775
We have a sworn statement
from the girl that helped him.

33:22.476 --> 33:24.545
Look, Rod, if that's the case,
we will...

33:24.611 --> 33:27.080
I remember when this
was once a great party.

33:27.147 --> 33:29.116
The party of ideas.

33:29.183 --> 33:31.385
Well, I guess you've run out.

33:32.686 --> 33:35.622
My family expects a public apology.

33:45.666 --> 33:47.568
[woman on TV] We're gonna go live

33:47.634 --> 33:49.636
- to Democratic National...
- Here we go.

33:49.703 --> 33:51.605
- Let Mr. Calloway know.
- Know what?

33:51.672 --> 33:54.041
DNC's chair's on live feed.

33:55.142 --> 33:58.679
- [man on TV] Mr. Chairman!
- Good morning. As Democrats,

33:58.745 --> 34:02.516
for years we've blamed
the Republicans for

34:02.583 --> 34:06.887
creating a climate in which the politics
of personal destruction flourish.

34:06.954 --> 34:08.121
[sighs]

34:08.188 --> 34:10.657
- Today, sadly...
- Turn it up, Kelly.

34:10.724 --> 34:14.995
...some of our own have stepped far
over the line of civility in politics.

34:15.062 --> 34:18.431
An employee of the DNC,
without my knowledge,

34:18.498 --> 34:21.935
is alleged to have
encouraged a young intern

34:22.002 --> 34:26.639
to place an illegal substance in a drink
of first gentleman, Rod Calloway.

34:26.706 --> 34:29.743
We are cooperating fully
with the proper authorities.

34:29.810 --> 34:32.179
As chairman,

34:32.246 --> 34:35.681
I apologize for the rogue
actions of these individuals.

34:35.748 --> 34:40.152
And I wish to convey
my most sincere regrets

34:40.219 --> 34:44.190
to the first gentleman,
the president

34:44.257 --> 34:47.226
and their family. Thank you.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.795
[man] Question! Question!

34:51.231 --> 34:53.467
Jim, how do we want to respond?

34:53.533 --> 34:56.536
- Only way we can. In kind.
- [Kelly] That's not what I meant.

34:56.603 --> 34:58.772
[Dickie] I know. We have to retaliate.

34:58.839 --> 35:01.208
Do the same kind of dirty work
with our own goons?

35:01.275 --> 35:03.977
Well, I'd prefer to call it
a political SWAT team.

35:04.044 --> 35:06.546
- Dickie.
- Ma'am?

35:06.613 --> 35:08.315
Can I have a moment?

35:12.319 --> 35:14.221
Close the door.

35:17.391 --> 35:20.894
This has been one of the most
frustrating weeks of my presidency.

35:20.961 --> 35:23.964
- I'm sure it has.
- I've been played, circumvented,

35:24.031 --> 35:26.466
publicly embarrassed,
privately hurt.

35:26.533 --> 35:29.169
All in the name of politics.

35:29.236 --> 35:31.772
If I can't take the high road
to the presidency,

35:31.838 --> 35:35.375
it's just not worth the journey,
at least, not to me.

35:35.442 --> 35:38.312
And if you are incapable
of traveling that road

35:38.378 --> 35:40.380
in the fashion
to which I'm committed,

35:40.447 --> 35:42.983
then I don't want you
representing me.

35:43.050 --> 35:47.387
I don't want you working for me.
I don't want you around.

35:48.789 --> 35:51.325
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

35:51.391 --> 35:54.328
- Then we're in agreement.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.099
Ma'am.

35:59.166 --> 36:03.737
The House closed voting on
your initiative. It passed, 238 to 109.

36:03.804 --> 36:05.839
I'm sorry.

36:13.747 --> 36:15.415
[horns honking]

36:18.251 --> 36:20.120
[chattering]

36:23.757 --> 36:27.027
- Richard Laughlin.
- Dickie McDonald.

36:28.795 --> 36:31.798
- Figured you'd be over the border.
- I have good lawyers.

36:31.865 --> 36:35.702
- DNC'll make this go away.
- No, man. You're kidding yourself.

36:35.769 --> 36:39.439
You committed a serious crime.
The DNC are gonna feed you to the dogs.

36:40.540 --> 36:43.210
- What were you thinking?
- Nothing you wouldn't have.

36:44.378 --> 36:46.847
Actually, I draw the line at felonies.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.916
I did what needed to be done.
She's splitting the party.

36:49.983 --> 36:53.754
The party can't afford to be split.
She keeps this up,

36:53.820 --> 36:56.356
she'll bring the system down.
The whole country.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.025
You know what's funny, Richard?

36:59.092 --> 37:01.261
I never pegged you
for a true believer.

37:02.863 --> 37:05.365
As opposed to being paid to be one.

37:08.702 --> 37:11.638
The truth is
we are a lot alike, Dickie.

37:11.705 --> 37:14.141
Trust me.

37:20.514 --> 37:22.682
[Jayne] What makes you
think she won't veto?

37:22.749 --> 37:26.386
She may yet.
But we can always override.

37:27.053 --> 37:29.790
In any event, she won't
be talking about it tonight.

37:29.856 --> 37:33.326
She can hardly claim
legislative victory

37:33.393 --> 37:37.431
when it's been usurped
by a costly rider.

37:37.497 --> 37:39.933
She's going to be forced
to talk about the economy

37:40.000 --> 37:42.836
which is always in
the crapper this time of year.

37:42.903 --> 37:45.038
So if I were you,
I would wear a warm coat.

37:45.105 --> 37:47.007
It's going to be a very cold room.

37:47.073 --> 37:48.742
Should we get dinner beforehand?

37:48.809 --> 37:51.845
Once she gets the floor,
God knows how long she'll be up there.

37:51.912 --> 37:54.514
[man on TV] ...over the line
of civility in politics.

37:54.581 --> 37:56.683
Oh, look at this.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.285
An employee of the DNC...

37:58.351 --> 38:01.354
- Better them than us.
- Amateur hour.

38:01.421 --> 38:03.156
[telephone rings]

38:04.891 --> 38:06.259
[Jayne] Hello?

38:08.995 --> 38:10.897
You've got to be kidding me.

38:12.165 --> 38:15.302
- What is it?
- Send it over ASAP.

38:15.368 --> 38:17.204
Thanks.

38:17.270 --> 38:20.474
They're messengering over
the president's State of the Union

38:20.540 --> 38:21.808
as a written report.

38:21.875 --> 38:24.578
- I don't understand.
- She's not addressing the House.

38:24.644 --> 38:27.547
- She's doing it from the Oval Office.
- She can't do that.

38:27.614 --> 38:29.816
They're citing
Article Two, Section Three.

38:29.883 --> 38:32.118
She doesn't have to
give a report in person.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.554
The joint session,
Supreme Court justices...

38:34.621 --> 38:37.257
Diplomatic corps. I know.
She's calling them all off.

38:40.694 --> 38:43.763
She's spitting in the face of history.

38:43.830 --> 38:47.167
In the face of every president
since Woodrow Wilson.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.877
Hey, let that rest.
It's a good speech.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.179
What's a five-letter word for highway?

38:59.246 --> 39:01.248
[scoffs] I should've known.

39:02.082 --> 39:05.252
- It's better than biting my nails.
- You're gonna be great.

39:06.353 --> 39:10.023
- [breathes deeply]
- So...

39:10.090 --> 39:12.492
...I am moving my things
out of the West Wing

39:12.559 --> 39:15.228
and back into the
first gentleman's office.

39:17.364 --> 39:20.534
- Rod, we can talk about...
- Mac. Mac.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.236
You're the first woman president.

39:23.303 --> 39:25.472
You need to stand taller
and be stronger

39:25.539 --> 39:27.541
than any man who's
come before you.

39:27.607 --> 39:31.778
And with me by your side,
you can't do that.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.283
It's not fair. It's not right.
But it's the truth.

39:38.485 --> 39:41.321
It'll be better that way.

39:41.388 --> 39:43.557
For us too.

39:43.623 --> 39:46.693
And you only have
eight minutes left.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.329
And that's your husband talking.

39:49.396 --> 39:51.598
Thanks.

39:52.799 --> 39:55.268
- Oh, it's... it's "route," by the way.
- What?

39:55.335 --> 39:57.637
"Route," it's a five-letter word
for highway.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.708
- Hmm.
- Mm-hm.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.212
[man] In three, two...

40:06.279 --> 40:09.282
My fellow Americans,
tonight I have the honor

40:09.349 --> 40:11.651
of reporting on the state
of our great union.

40:11.718 --> 40:14.120
And I've chosen to do so,

40:14.187 --> 40:16.690
not before
the people's representatives,

40:16.756 --> 40:19.292
but directly to the people
who are watching this

40:19.359 --> 40:23.830
on television in living rooms
and workplaces across the country.

40:23.897 --> 40:26.199
The past year has been one of tragedy,

40:26.266 --> 40:28.568
of both pain and pride,

40:28.635 --> 40:30.904
of victory and uncertainty.

40:30.971 --> 40:34.240
Despite this,
the American economy is strong,

40:34.307 --> 40:36.176
the will of the people, unbending,

40:36.242 --> 40:38.612
and its conscience, clear.

40:38.678 --> 40:42.349
I wish that the same could be said
of our elected officials in Washington.

40:42.415 --> 40:44.484
As witnessed recently,

40:44.551 --> 40:47.320
tactics of ugliness
and deception have prevailed.

40:47.387 --> 40:52.125
Earlier today, bill HR1468
was passed by Congress,

40:52.192 --> 40:55.629
a bill designed to help
men, women and children

40:55.695 --> 40:58.298
across the nation find jobs,

40:58.365 --> 41:01.134
find homes and build lives.

41:01.201 --> 41:03.737
But that bill doesn't exist any longer.

41:03.803 --> 41:07.574
It was hijacked
and inflated by ideology,

41:07.641 --> 41:11.244
by a system,
by personal agenda.

41:11.311 --> 41:15.181
It was amended,
not because it needed improvement,

41:15.248 --> 41:19.552
but because it could pave the way for
special interest groups to make money,

41:19.619 --> 41:22.155
for them to treat poverty
with prison terms.

41:22.222 --> 41:23.990
It was business as usual.

41:24.057 --> 41:26.393
It was politics as usual.

41:26.459 --> 41:28.361
In the next ten days,

41:28.428 --> 41:30.930
I will be vetoing HR1468,

41:30.997 --> 41:33.366
a bill I myself sponsored.

41:33.433 --> 41:36.503
It's important that you, the people,

41:36.569 --> 41:39.539
let your representatives
know that our government,

41:39.606 --> 41:44.577
that our liberty and that
our rights are not for sale.

41:44.644 --> 41:47.514
If you do, I promise you this:

41:47.580 --> 41:49.716
The end of politics as usual

41:49.783 --> 41:53.219
and the beginning
of true political independence.
