WEBVTT

02:20.432 --> 02:21.892
She's a pain!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.232
Do have any cigarettes?

02:29.315 --> 02:32.401
No, just a cigar stub from Robert.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.862
Give it to me!

02:33.944 --> 02:35.112
He had to keep it.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.698
No, give it to me!

02:36.782 --> 02:37.782
Thanks.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.497
Mind if I open the window?

02:43.579 --> 02:47.041
Yes, I mind.
That's exactly right. I do mind.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.545
No, no AC, please.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.923
I can't stand it, I hate it.

02:53.005 --> 02:54.882
I've told you 10 times!

02:55.717 --> 02:58.177
I'm burning up.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.610
You never answer my calls!

03:13.692 --> 03:15.152
Robert's waiting!

03:15.237 --> 03:16.779
Robert Danjou?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.280
You promised to see him.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.076
Where's Mira's dressing room?

03:21.158 --> 03:24.371
- 2nd floor. Shall I take you?
- I can manage.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.956
I meant no offense.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.874
Screw what you meant.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.835
Ok, great. Robert Danjou.

03:34.964 --> 03:35.964
René!

03:36.590 --> 03:38.384
I'm so happy to see you!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.262
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.888
We had a coffee date.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.974
I have bigger issues to deal with.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.186
Which is why you need coffee.
Sit down.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.814
Excuse me...

03:51.689 --> 03:54.109
Can I get a double espresso?

03:54.693 --> 03:55.944
I have to have coffee with him.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.153
Sure.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.280
So, what's wrong?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.658
I need Mira to grasp the importance

04:02.743 --> 04:04.870
of the abduction scene.

04:04.952 --> 04:07.329
And her crucial scene
with the Grand Vampire.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.040
Sure...

04:09.123 --> 04:11.041
Mira and I prepared well for it.

04:12.501 --> 04:16.213
You worked on it together
without telling me?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.632
That's why I wanted to see you.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.259
We polished the dialogue.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.012
Minor touch-ups here and there.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.971
Actors often do that.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.684
No, actors do not often do that.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.644
Just wait, you'll be happy.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.896
We worked hard on our chemistry.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.899
What chemistry?

04:35.024 --> 04:36.984
We're playing a couple.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.611
Says who?

04:40.905 --> 04:42.282
You're joking?

04:42.365 --> 04:44.408
We're a couple, c'mon!

04:44.491 --> 04:46.118
No.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.787
Sorry, that never occurred to me.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.291
Who said you're a couple?

04:51.373 --> 04:53.918
- Did you read the script?
- Of course.

04:54.001 --> 04:55.921
There's no couple in it.

04:56.003 --> 04:59.257
Ok, ok. Anyway, our work
sessions have been fabulous.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.675
Work sessions?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.302
We found our rhythm.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.678
We're in sync! That's rare.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.097
- Thanks.
- Very rare.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.350
- And amazing.
- So, Robert...

05:10.142 --> 05:12.479
we'll continue this later.

05:13.270 --> 05:15.356
Anytime. I'm at your service.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.527
- One more small thing.
- Yes?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.487
I'm so grateful to you.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.698
It's wonderful to work
with a great director

05:24.783 --> 05:26.575
and a great friend.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.496
Thanks.

05:29.578 --> 05:33.917
It's important to put
these things into words.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.586
I'm honored that you trust me.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.588
Feuillade had a new actor playing

05:38.672 --> 05:40.024
the Grand Vampire in each episode.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.093
How ingenious of you
to meld them all into one!

05:43.176 --> 05:47.638
It gives me all the space I need

05:47.722 --> 05:51.600
to express the nuances
of this criminal mastermind!

05:51.684 --> 05:54.187
I'm sure you'll pull it off.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.773
I hope to be worthy of your trust.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.733
Very generous of you.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.125
Very sexy.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.994
Enough, Malik.
Get out of my fucking frame.

09:38.076 --> 09:39.454
Almost done.

09:39.536 --> 09:41.956
- No! Jesus Christ!
- Just a minute.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.665
Almost done...

09:43.750 --> 09:45.542
- There!
- Let's go!

09:45.626 --> 09:46.835
Mark it!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.885
Let's go! Roll camera!

10:36.427 --> 10:38.053
Quiet on the set!

11:27.728 --> 11:28.728
We'll be going again.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.449
2 seconds. Wait 2 seconds.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.900
Action.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.448
I've looked everywhere.
She's nowhere to be found.

13:43.530 --> 13:46.533
She's not in her dressing room,
not in wardrobe.

13:46.616 --> 13:50.036
I have no idea.
I've combed the whole place!

18:51.087 --> 18:52.381
I got everything that time.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.979
Am I disturbing you?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.732
No, I was just reading
"The Financial Times."

19:11.317 --> 19:12.693
Can we talk?

19:14.360 --> 19:15.403
Sure.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.946
Sit down.

19:19.866 --> 19:23.663
Sorry to be blunt, but I'm confused.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.708
Mira just told me you see
her and the Grand Vampire

19:27.792 --> 19:29.459
as business partners.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.671
No, not at all.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.133
Why would I have said such a thing?

19:36.216 --> 19:38.678
That's what I thought!

19:38.761 --> 19:40.221
I guess she misunderstood.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.057
It was probably due to my bad English!

19:45.391 --> 19:47.393
Exactly!

19:47.477 --> 19:48.896
What a relief!

19:48.978 --> 19:50.355
Robert,

19:50.439 --> 19:52.398
you have nothing to worry about.

19:58.154 --> 19:59.154
Skylar!

20:00.698 --> 20:03.576
We need pics for Instagram!

20:03.660 --> 20:06.872
This is such a fresh look for you.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.082
Can you get the full body?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.352
Great. Thanks.

22:34.018 --> 22:35.603
- See you tomorrow.
- 6:30 am.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.649
- Why so early?
- Road closures.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.483
What a drag.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.573
I'm back!

22:45.656 --> 22:47.491
You finished late.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.034
I waited around all day

22:49.117 --> 22:51.494
and ended up shooting
my scenes in overtime.

22:51.579 --> 22:52.621
How was it?

22:53.288 --> 22:56.375
Terrible. Everyone shouting at everyone.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.751
Where are the kids?

22:58.835 --> 23:00.254
At my mother's.

23:00.336 --> 23:03.299
She promised them pizza
and a horror film.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.384
Why terrible?

23:06.050 --> 23:09.096
My character's a fool
and René doesn't care.

23:09.178 --> 23:11.514
Is it really that bad?

23:11.597 --> 23:15.476
Whatever Mira does,
she's a genius to him.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.854
And me?

23:16.937 --> 23:18.439
She is impressive, though.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.358
I know, I pale in comparison.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.360
It's not a competition.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.572
I can't help myself.

23:26.654 --> 23:27.654
Come see the dailies.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.916
Wow.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.292
She's magnetic.

23:38.374 --> 23:40.085
I knew it.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.379
Wow, okay!

23:43.464 --> 23:45.299
Very hot.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.259
Hot? It didn't look hot on set.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.136
It's super hot.

23:56.684 --> 23:58.562
When will we be there?

23:58.646 --> 23:59.980
30 minutes.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.774
- 30 minutes?
- Yes.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.942
Next time I'll ask for a motorcycle taxi.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.794
Here's the footage.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.713
From the show you're working on?

24:24.796 --> 24:26.298
Wow! So that's really Mira Harberg?

24:26.381 --> 24:27.381
Show me!

24:39.812 --> 24:41.146
Do you have a minute?

24:41.229 --> 24:42.439
Yes.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.650
So, we've been talking amongst ourselves.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.319
We've been having a good conversation

24:48.404 --> 24:49.655
about a serious subject.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.906
OK, go on...

24:51.991 --> 24:55.160
Please understand that
I'm merely the spokesperson.

24:55.244 --> 24:59.997
I'm here to convey the views
that most of us share.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.459
- OK.
- May I sit down?

25:02.543 --> 25:05.169
Of course, sit down!

25:05.253 --> 25:07.756
- You too, have a seat.
- Have a seat, Marie.

25:08.923 --> 25:10.300
So, we have...

25:10.383 --> 25:11.635
a concern.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.345
Do you not get the impression

25:14.430 --> 25:16.722
that Moreno

25:17.765 --> 25:19.977
is raping Irma Vep in that scene?

25:20.769 --> 25:23.856
I don't know what you're getting at.

25:23.938 --> 25:27.026
Listen, excuse me,
but he hypnotizes her.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.192
Yes!

25:28.277 --> 25:29.777
Then when she's unconscious,

25:29.862 --> 25:31.863
he takes advantage of her.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.282
Exactly!

25:34.157 --> 25:36.451
Ok, but isn't that a form of rape?

25:36.952 --> 25:40.539
Maybe, but i'm just recreating,

25:40.621 --> 25:44.083
almost identically, Feuillade's scene.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.503
I think it's rather convenient

25:46.587 --> 25:48.422
the way you hide behind Feuillade.

25:48.504 --> 25:50.840
Did he make films in an era

25:50.924 --> 25:54.386
when abused women
were forced to shut up?

25:55.845 --> 25:58.097
He made films in 1915!

25:58.181 --> 26:00.766
If you're asking if
that was a century ago,

26:00.851 --> 26:03.603
the answer is yes!
We're in 2022!

26:03.687 --> 26:04.980
Ok?

26:05.980 --> 26:07.900
Where's this coming from? Sorry.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.321
Eat, eat! Take your break.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.073
Sure, but...

26:56.156 --> 26:59.617
The ban was eventually lifted
and the shoot continued.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.166
Extraordinary.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.169
You're celebrating the fact

27:09.252 --> 27:11.337
that a woman was complicit
in her own exploitation.

27:11.420 --> 27:16.050
Come on!
How can you spew such bullshit?

27:16.133 --> 27:17.761
Sorry, but times change.

27:17.843 --> 27:22.390
Women no longer accept abusive
directors like Feuillade

27:22.474 --> 27:23.517
and his ilk.

27:23.599 --> 27:24.852
Get used to it.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.311
So Robert, you're saying you agree

27:27.396 --> 27:31.399
with the police chief, not Musidora?

27:31.482 --> 27:33.402
You bet I do.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.030
The police chief
was the one decent person

27:38.115 --> 27:39.992
in the whole nasty business.

27:40.074 --> 27:41.325
Fine.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.287
The good news is,

27:43.370 --> 27:46.707
you found the scene provocative.

27:46.789 --> 27:50.001
Sure, in a perverted way, perhaps.

27:50.085 --> 27:54.171
Sexy in a perverted way.
That's what we're after.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.965
So what's the problem?

28:02.556 --> 28:03.891
He's right!

28:19.865 --> 28:24.619
The truth is, the scene
clearly aroused you.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.207
And it disturbed me
to be aroused by a scene

28:28.289 --> 28:31.043
that's offensive to women.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.464
Damn!

28:35.546 --> 28:37.007
Look out!

28:38.383 --> 28:39.550
Relax, no rush...

28:40.719 --> 28:42.971
- You drive like a crazy person.
- Really?

28:43.055 --> 28:46.433
If that guy hadn't stopped short,
he would have hit us.

28:46.515 --> 28:48.601
I feel like I drive slowly.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.689
You were wrong to challenge Robert.

28:52.772 --> 28:55.399
- Why?
- Because he has a point.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.651
What do you mean?

28:56.734 --> 28:58.778
Robert's just furious

28:58.862 --> 29:00.948
because Moreno took Irma Vep
from him

29:01.031 --> 29:03.532
and gets to have a kinky scene with her.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.076
He's the one being gross, not me.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.205
True. But it's your choice
to overstate the sexual element.

29:09.289 --> 29:13.959
It's innocuous compared
to what we see in movies now.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.253
Ok, but it's a fine line.

29:17.004 --> 29:18.507
I don't get it.

29:18.589 --> 29:20.842
What aren't you getting?

29:21.343 --> 29:23.302
Hi, a beer please, you?

29:23.761 --> 29:26.056
I need an espresso.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.351
The world is changing,

29:30.435 --> 29:32.521
and this is a hot button topic.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.899
Right, but Robert is using this
as an excuse!

29:36.984 --> 29:40.194
Sure! He's angry that
you won't give him his way.

29:40.277 --> 29:42.197
So he's playing the puritan to annoy you.

29:42.279 --> 29:43.699
He's a hypocrite!

29:43.782 --> 29:46.242
We all know that! He's so transparent.

29:46.326 --> 29:50.205
But if you don't take heed,
you will offend some people.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.498
- Me?
- Yes, you!

29:52.582 --> 29:55.126
Why on earth would you be spared?

29:55.794 --> 29:56.919
Listen...

29:57.670 --> 30:02.301
Be honest. Do you think
I have ever lacked sensitivity

30:02.383 --> 30:03.802
on gender issues?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.637
No, but you're a man.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.097
You have to be mindful of your privilege.

30:08.180 --> 30:10.350
I always check my privilege!

30:10.433 --> 30:11.852
Even with Irma Vep's rape?

30:11.935 --> 30:13.894
It's in the original!

30:13.979 --> 30:15.438
Yes, it is.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.982
And you seem to get off on it.

30:18.065 --> 30:20.943
Of course I get off on it!

30:21.028 --> 30:25.030
If I don't, how will the audience?

30:25.114 --> 30:26.992
What's the problem?

30:27.075 --> 30:29.578
Shouldn't movies get people off?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.663
Depends where you draw the line.

30:32.497 --> 30:36.000
Crossing the line is what gets people off.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.586
Know who you sound like?

30:39.420 --> 30:40.504
Gottfried.

33:26.253 --> 33:27.338
Hello.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.131
Let me call you back.

33:30.090 --> 33:33.136
Gregory, I stayed up
all night writing a new scene.

33:33.218 --> 33:36.347
Musidora has to speak for herself.

33:36.430 --> 33:39.058
I cannot allow Robert Danjou

33:39.142 --> 33:42.645
to make her say what she never said.

33:42.729 --> 33:47.526
This new scene
will help clear everything up.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.778
The scene is based on historical fact.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.491
When the production was shut
down by the authorities in 1916,

33:54.574 --> 33:59.996
Musidora herself pleaded
the case with the police chief!

34:01.039 --> 34:03.667
Their conversation is in her memoir.

34:03.749 --> 34:05.168
Look...

36:38.905 --> 36:40.573
Please, monsieur police chief...

38:09.328 --> 38:11.122
- Have a good day!
- Thanks.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.758
Dear Gregory, how are you?

38:21.840 --> 38:23.760
Thank you for coming.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.052
You're welcome.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.180
How's it going on set right now?

38:28.263 --> 38:31.100
Cast and crew are laser-focused.

38:31.183 --> 38:34.187
The vibe on set is good.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.356
Well, René has been
harassing me on my cell.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.817
When I finally picked up,

38:38.900 --> 38:41.818
he told me he wants
to get rid of Robert Danjou.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.238
- Why is that?
- I asked him why.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.827
He ranted incoherently,
using language that was...

38:50.035 --> 38:51.119
quite foul.

38:52.746 --> 38:54.122
You know René.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.501
That's why I'm worried.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.087
René and Robert had an argument,

38:59.170 --> 39:00.338
but it's settled now.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.179
Thank you.

39:09.429 --> 39:12.642
No way he's firing Danjou or anyone else.

39:12.725 --> 39:17.104
Does René realize
that if he derails, he's off the show?

39:17.897 --> 39:20.816
If he derails, he'll stop
coming to work all on his own.

39:20.899 --> 39:22.401
And we'll be in trouble.

39:24.027 --> 39:26.488
Do we have a backup plan?

39:28.324 --> 39:29.450
Backup plan?

39:30.325 --> 39:33.870
In case we're forced to terminate René.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.167
Hello.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.377
Welcome, sir.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.586
I'm meeting Ms. Harberg.

39:41.670 --> 39:42.964
Yes. She's over there.

41:27.484 --> 41:29.946
There are no sick days in cinema.

41:30.028 --> 41:31.196
We show up.

41:31.279 --> 41:35.076
Extras for your scene
cost me 2,000 francs!

41:35.159 --> 41:36.577
Do you realize that?

41:36.661 --> 41:39.496
There was no one to come
tell you, I live alone.

41:39.579 --> 41:41.457
You're not cut out for cinema,
Jean Aymé.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.630
Will I be shooting today,
or may I leave now?

41:48.296 --> 41:49.297
Buzz off!

41:50.174 --> 41:51.175
Very well.

41:54.594 --> 41:55.594
Wait.

41:57.222 --> 41:58.599
Jean Aymé, follow me.

42:00.934 --> 42:02.477
Manichoux, let's shoot!

42:02.561 --> 42:03.937
Light the set.

42:06.189 --> 42:07.900
Go fetch Musidora. Hurry!

42:16.701 --> 42:17.910
Here's the scene.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.579
There will be no rehearsal
before we shoot.

42:21.788 --> 42:23.541
Irma Vep awaits the Grand Vampire...

42:32.467 --> 42:33.551
Let's shoot.

42:34.427 --> 42:35.802
- Positions.
- Ready.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.138
Let's roll.

42:42.058 --> 42:43.352
Action.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.195
Cut!

42:53.863 --> 42:55.614
Next scene.

42:55.697 --> 42:57.115
Fetch Moreno!

43:00.161 --> 43:02.747
So, what's next?

43:02.829 --> 43:05.540
Go straight to the accountant
for your last paycheck.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.584
Musidora killed you. You're done.

43:09.794 --> 43:11.047
Buzz off.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.299
Next!

43:15.218 --> 43:16.968
I asked for Moreno. Where is he?
