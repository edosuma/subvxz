00:03.678 --> 00:05.202
Here we go.

00:05.203 --> 00:10.231
Narrator: The deadliest roads in
North America take their toll.

00:10.232 --> 00:12.932
Oh.. [Bleep] Me!

00:13.418 --> 00:15.556
Narrator: On the Dempster..

00:15.557 --> 00:17.651
I'm seeing a whole bunch of white.

00:17.652 --> 00:21.866
Narrator: The biggest storm of the
season strikes Hurricane Alley.

00:21.867 --> 00:24.559
Where are we? I'm off the road?

00:24.560 --> 00:28.011
Yeah, I don't think this
is a very good idea.

00:28.012 --> 00:29.102
Narrator: In Alaska..

00:29.103 --> 00:30.952
Come on, Kitty Kenworth.

00:30.953 --> 00:34.102
Narrator: No one is safe from Atigun Pass.

00:34.103 --> 00:38.718
Holy [Bleep]! Whoa! Whoa!
Catch it, catch it, come on!

00:38.719 --> 00:43.472
Narrator: And making it
through means risking it all.

00:43.473 --> 00:45.690
There's Ice Road Trucking for you.

00:45.691 --> 00:47.671
Holy..

01:30.916 --> 01:34.456
Narrator: White Horse, Yukon.

01:35.208 --> 01:38.028
Okay. [Beeps horn]

01:38.191 --> 01:41.191
Giddy up. Let's go.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.183
Narrator: Veteran Alex
Debogorski is racing to

01:45.184 --> 01:48.601
start a two day haul up
the Dempster Highway.

01:48.602 --> 01:54.206
I've got 55,000 pounds of groceries.
I'm taking them north to Inuvik.

01:54.207 --> 02:00.107
Narrator: To get north, he'll have
to go through Hurricane Alley..

02:00.981 --> 02:06.881
Where violent winds and whiteout
conditions can shut down the road.

02:07.434 --> 02:10.389
I'm partnered up with
another driver on this run.

02:10.389 --> 02:14.050
I'll be traveling with Steve.

02:15.215 --> 02:17.453
Narrator: And with a storm on the way..

02:17.454 --> 02:22.134
There's safety in numbers in the
remote Canadian wilderness.

02:22.135 --> 02:27.573
My name's Steve Moore and I'm a line
haul driver for Manitoulin Transport.

02:27.574 --> 02:31.274
I've been driving for 32 years now.

02:31.275 --> 02:32.719
All right.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.832
Everything's looking good far.

02:34.833 --> 02:38.387
Narrator: They're hauling
a combined 110,000 pounds

02:38.388 --> 02:43.422
of food and supplies for
Canada's arctic communities.

02:43.423 --> 02:46.348
It's fresh produce, so it's
urgent to get it up there.

02:46.349 --> 02:49.730
If we don't get it up soon enough, it
starts sprouting and getting roots.

02:49.731 --> 02:54.767
So we need to get up there
before it goes bad.

02:54.768 --> 02:57.903
How about you, Alex? Are you out there?

02:57.904 --> 03:01.444
Okay, Steve, we can go now.

03:07.034 --> 03:08.968
Well, we're finally away.

03:08.969 --> 03:11.705
Turned off the Klondike highway..

03:11.706 --> 03:13.875
Bound for Inuvik.

03:13.876 --> 03:16.362
The land of the midnight sun.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.238
Narrator: To deliver the food
to the people who rely on it,

03:19.239 --> 03:24.997
they'll have to reach Hurricane Alley
before the storm shuts it down.

03:24.998 --> 03:27.398
[Horn blows]

03:29.324 --> 03:32.426
Blowing snow, falling snow, whiteout..

03:32.427 --> 03:34.978
It doesn't really matter.

03:34.979 --> 03:39.299
We're gonna drive into it. That's it.

03:40.768 --> 03:45.808
Narrator: 490 miles to the
northwest, in Alaska..

03:46.952 --> 03:51.152
Temperatures are plunging to 45 below.

03:52.423 --> 03:53.224
[Truck horn beeps]

03:53.225 --> 03:56.824
But two haul road heavyweights
are heating up the ice.

03:56.825 --> 03:59.200
Don't cut my throat to keep your nickname.

03:59.201 --> 04:01.477
It's all about freight, man.

04:01.478 --> 04:05.948
Narrator: Jack Jessee's looking to
hold onto his title as haul road ace.

04:05.949 --> 04:08.577
Feels like it's my turn
to kick some butt now.

04:08.578 --> 04:12.327
It's time somebody puts
little Jack in his place.

04:12.328 --> 04:16.612
Narrator: While newcomer Darrell
Ward is out for cold, hard cash.

04:16.613 --> 04:21.413
[Bleep] You, Jack!
You're costing Reno money.

04:23.039 --> 04:25.425
Narrator: At Carlile's Fairbanks yard..

04:25.426 --> 04:28.370
Darrell scores again.

04:28.371 --> 04:31.035
Darrell Ward leads the
load count after last

04:31.036 --> 04:33.769
night's back haul shot
him into the top spot.

04:33.770 --> 04:37.123
I have a rivalry with Jack Jessee out here.

04:37.124 --> 04:40.688
Jack doesn't know what I can do.
That gives me that edge.

04:40.689 --> 04:44.686
It's kind of like the element of surprise.

04:44.687 --> 04:46.719
I'll take him down.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.226
Ya, I've got a load of sheetrock
here on a flatbed trailer.

04:49.227 --> 04:52.510
Spring ride's gonna ride like hell.
Ah, there we go.

04:52.511 --> 04:56.022
Narrator: Darrell's load is
48,000 pounds of construction

04:56.023 --> 04:59.037
material bound for the oil
fields of Prudhoe Bay.

04:59.038 --> 05:03.826
Always getting these [Bleep]
junk ass [Bleep] trailers.

05:03.827 --> 05:06.227
Good enough.

05:06.236 --> 05:10.790
Narrator: But it's sitting on one of the
most worn out trailers in the yard.

05:10.791 --> 05:15.180
So you know, this iron, the older
it gets, the iron gets brittle.

05:15.181 --> 05:19.561
Hoping it makes it. I'm ready to roll.

05:29.685 --> 05:33.358
Gonna be a rough old ride.
All I ever got was a rough ride.

05:33.359 --> 05:37.679
All the way from trucking to marriages.

05:42.785 --> 05:46.901
Narrator: At the other end of the road..

05:46.902 --> 05:49.659
Pretty sure we're taking our trailer
that we brought up here home,

05:49.660 --> 05:52.817
so we're just gonna go get
our paperwork for it.

05:52.818 --> 05:58.116
Austin Wheeler's just finished his
first solo heavy haul up the Dalton..

05:58.117 --> 06:00.091
Let's keep going.

06:00.092 --> 06:04.181
Narrator: And secured his spot
among the haul road elite.

06:04.182 --> 06:06.218
Took some real thought and skill.

06:06.219 --> 06:12.119
Kinda shows people what I'm made
of and what I'm capable of.

06:13.702 --> 06:15.793
- What's going on, man?
- What's going on?

06:15.794 --> 06:18.118
Just trying to get something to
head back to Fairbanks with.

06:18.119 --> 06:22.086
Right on. Well, I'm just gonna
have you take a special load.

06:22.087 --> 06:23.154
Sweet, man.

06:23.155 --> 06:27.553
Narrator: For his next
heavy haul assignment..

06:27.554 --> 06:31.394
Austin's headed 423 miles south.

06:32.255 --> 06:38.155
To pick up an industrial water truck
at the Livengood mining camp.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.609
Well we just got our dispatch to go home.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.716
There's a piece of equipment
at the mining camp

06:45.717 --> 06:48.062
right in Livengood that
needs to be picked up.

06:48.063 --> 06:50.499
That'll make the day interesting.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.578
Narrator: It'll be another
test for the 23-year-old,

06:53.579 --> 06:56.398
as he hits the road on his own.

06:56.399 --> 06:59.519
Welcome to heavy haul.

07:00.916 --> 07:04.216
300 miles to the south..

07:04.790 --> 07:08.083
I wanna just try to make it
through the rest of this season.

07:08.084 --> 07:10.848
Narrator: Ronald "Porkchop"
Mangum is also on the

07:10.849 --> 07:14.689
road alone with a load
of construction gravel.

07:14.690 --> 07:18.426
Load is pretty decent.
Hauling about 82,000 pounds total.

07:18.427 --> 07:20.525
We're gonna push on through
to Prudhoe Bay tonight.

07:20.526 --> 07:24.705
I was gonna stop at Coldfoot, but I'm
trying to get caught up on this load count.

07:24.706 --> 07:29.991
Narrator: This is only the third solo
run for the South Carolina Native.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.777
Yeah! Yeah!

07:31.778 --> 07:35.042
Narrator: But after just
couple of deliveries..

07:35.043 --> 07:36.409
That's what I'm talking about.

07:36.410 --> 07:39.564
Prudhoe Bay, get the hell out
the way, here comes the Chop.

07:39.565 --> 07:42.050
Narrator: Success has gone to his head.

07:42.051 --> 07:44.871
[Truck horn beeps]

07:48.347 --> 07:53.661
I'm down a couple of loads now, and I
gotta get caught back up in the game.

07:53.662 --> 07:58.032
It's kinda like I'm coming back out
at half time, down 14 to nothing.

07:58.033 --> 08:02.953
Time to go 5 wide.
Call that 151 trips right.

08:03.365 --> 08:08.765
I ain't stopping.
I'm pushing on through to Prudhoe.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.364
He's all over the place.

08:12.365 --> 08:15.484
Narrator: And tired of taking
it from other drivers..

08:15.485 --> 08:18.236
Can you get on your side of the damn road?

08:18.237 --> 08:21.013
Narrator: Now he's dishing it out.

08:21.014 --> 08:23.834
[Truck horn beeps]

08:24.009 --> 08:27.215
Damn, you gonna give me some room?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.864
What the hell, dude? Back off!

08:29.865 --> 08:32.625
Sorry about that.

08:34.392 --> 08:38.431
See these guys out here, they don't wanna
get over on their side of the road.

08:38.432 --> 08:43.332
Makes 'em dangerous when you're..
Meet oncoming traffic. So..

08:43.332 --> 08:46.213
It is what it is.

08:48.973 --> 08:54.553
Narrator: As the sun sets in Alaska..
[Truck horn beeps]

08:54.790 --> 08:57.243
About five and a half hours into this trip.

08:57.244 --> 09:01.365
I got this hot load of
fuel I gotta get Prudhoe.

09:01.366 --> 09:04.114
Narrator: Haul road ace
Jack Jessee rolls north.

09:04.115 --> 09:07.742
One load down to load count leader Darrell.

09:07.743 --> 09:10.203
I have to take extra
precautions with this load.

09:10.204 --> 09:13.625
It's a hazardous material.
It's flammable and it's heavy.

09:13.626 --> 09:19.130
Narrator: But his 82,000 pound
load of fuel is slowing him down.

09:19.131 --> 09:21.846
Basically the haul road is a one lane road.

09:21.847 --> 09:25.553
When you're out here by yourself, man,
you're the only one that can screw up.

09:25.554 --> 09:31.454
You put other trucks in the mix, one bad
call in judgment can take everybody out.

09:35.882 --> 09:38.702
[Truck horn beeps]

09:42.413 --> 09:43.583
[Truck horn beeps]

09:43.584 --> 09:46.704
Who the hell is this?

09:47.758 --> 09:49.618
God!

09:55.512 --> 09:57.651
[Truck horn beeps]

09:57.652 --> 09:59.247
Narrator: Out of the darkness..

09:59.248 --> 10:01.274
What the hell is he doing?

10:01.275 --> 10:05.357
Narrator: Another driver's
coming in fast behind Jack.

10:05.358 --> 10:10.098
The edge is just hard to find to make room.

10:17.869 --> 10:20.168
[Chuckles] [Horn blasting]

10:20.169 --> 10:22.287
Slow down!

10:22.288 --> 10:24.208
Whoa!

10:24.974 --> 10:26.007
Narrator: Coming up..

10:26.008 --> 10:28.370
There's a few bigger
drifts on the road now.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.798
Narrator: The fury of Hurricane Alley.

10:30.799 --> 10:35.719
Yeah, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

10:37.627 --> 10:40.049
Narrator: In the dead of night..

10:40.050 --> 10:42.870
[Truck horn beeps]

10:43.561 --> 10:45.561
What the hell is he doing?

10:48.415 --> 10:54.315
Narrator: A truck tries to overtake Jack
on a narrow stretch of the haul road.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.556
[Chuckles] [Horn blasting]

11:02.557 --> 11:04.368
Slow down!

11:04.369 --> 11:06.289
Whoa!

11:10.178 --> 11:12.731
That was close. [Bleep].

11:12.732 --> 11:15.552
Did you see that?

11:19.921 --> 11:22.801
Is that you, Jack?

11:22.856 --> 11:26.276
That's Darrell. What the..

11:31.465 --> 11:33.623
You didn't say anything,
Darrell, what the hell?

11:33.624 --> 11:35.797
Kinda.. Kinda scared me a little there.

11:35.798 --> 11:39.194
Well, I figured whoever it is, I was
gonna wake 'em up for damn sure.

11:39.195 --> 11:43.563
You know, Darrell, passing like that's
not gonna win you any friends out here.

11:43.564 --> 11:45.916
You know, I'm not out here
to make friends, Jack.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.962
I've got plenty of them.

11:48.963 --> 11:51.613
You know, you, uh, you might
wanna watch your back.

11:51.614 --> 11:55.154
I might be gunning for you.

11:55.198 --> 11:57.412
Narrator: Darrell with his lighter load has

11:57.413 --> 12:00.974
the advantage over Jack's
heavy fuel tanker.

12:00.975 --> 12:03.761
Probably be finishing up with
my dinner in Coldfoot about the

12:03.762 --> 12:06.500
time you pull into your parking spot huh?

12:06.501 --> 12:08.438
Well, I got this fuel on here.

12:08.439 --> 12:10.970
I can't go bouncing down
the road like you guys.

12:10.971 --> 12:15.155
Well, Jack, I guess I'll
see you on the flip flop.

12:15.156 --> 12:17.087
One last thought to think on.

12:17.088 --> 12:21.828
Tortoise versus the hare.
Who won that race?

12:24.419 --> 12:26.590
Man, it's guys like that, that..

12:26.591 --> 12:29.636
Cause problems and accidents out here.

12:29.637 --> 12:31.218
You always question the new guys.

12:31.219 --> 12:33.819
I don't care what you knew
before you showed up here.

12:33.820 --> 12:37.109
Certain mistakes up here can kill you.

12:37.110 --> 12:39.606
You know, could have just,
like, dodged a pothole

12:39.607 --> 12:42.213
at the very wrong moment
when he came flying by.

12:42.214 --> 12:44.584
Now you got two trucks in the ditch.

12:44.585 --> 12:47.656
And that ain't how we roll out here.

12:47.657 --> 12:50.717
Poor old Jack Jessee.

12:50.792 --> 12:54.315
Passed him on the road.
Passed him in the load count.

12:54.316 --> 12:58.876
Jack don't know what come around, did he?

12:58.933 --> 13:03.336
Narrator: While Jack an Darrell
battle to Prudhoe Bay..

13:03.337 --> 13:06.157
[Truck horn beeps]

13:06.874 --> 13:09.545
I've still gotta stop and
load up that freaking..

13:09.546 --> 13:13.241
Six wheel drive water truck thing.

13:13.242 --> 13:17.065
Narrator: Austin Wheeler's taking
on a heavy haul special assignment

13:17.066 --> 13:20.195
at a mining camp just off the Dalton.

13:20.196 --> 13:22.577
I'm trying to make a name for myself by,

13:22.578 --> 13:25.120
hauling some of the biggest
loads the most awkward loads.

13:25.121 --> 13:30.866
Just to show people that I'm good at what
I do and I have what it takes to be here.

13:30.867 --> 13:35.902
Narrator: But this job's more
than just hook up and go.

13:35.903 --> 13:38.663
Whoa. That's good.

13:38.664 --> 13:44.424
Narrator: It's up to Austin
to load and secure the cargo.

13:44.679 --> 13:49.462
We're just about to load up
this machine on here, so..

13:49.463 --> 13:53.603
- Okay, let's take her slow.
- Yep.

13:54.098 --> 13:57.818
I think it's pretty cool. Ha.

13:58.928 --> 14:02.172
Narrator: The truck is
as wide as the trailer.

14:02.173 --> 14:03.430
Here we go.

14:03.431 --> 14:05.711
All right.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.502
Pull forward a little bit.

14:08.503 --> 14:13.704
Narrator: A couple of inches
too far to either side..

14:16.036 --> 14:18.484
And the load will end up on the ground.

14:18.485 --> 14:21.665
Give it a little pump!

14:31.822 --> 14:33.622
Go!

14:33.995 --> 14:35.822
- Whoa.
- Hold up!

14:50.388 --> 14:51.817
Whoa!

14:51.818 --> 14:54.338
There you go.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.959
Sweet, thanks, guys.

15:00.320 --> 15:04.651
Whenever I load my own stuff, I always make
sure it's loaded right and tied down right.

15:04.652 --> 15:08.505
I think making anybody good on this
road means not breaking loads,

15:08.506 --> 15:13.726
not damaging 'em, but also
getting home safely too.

15:15.522 --> 15:19.032
You never know, something could happen.

15:19.033 --> 15:22.295
All right, let's do this.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.939
It's been a really extremely long day.

15:25.940 --> 15:29.300
And I am ready to leave.

15:30.218 --> 15:34.153
Narrator: The load's secured
and Austin's feeling good.

15:34.154 --> 15:37.786
Austin Wheeler is a bad ass,
and I pretty much just drove..

15:37.787 --> 15:39.960
Got in that thing and made it my [Bleep].

15:39.961 --> 15:42.061
[Giggle]

15:49.796 --> 15:52.711
Narrator: 350 miles to the east..

15:52.712 --> 15:55.822
And we're off like a..

15:55.823 --> 15:57.299
Bale of turtles.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.520
[Laughing]

16:03.196 --> 16:08.455
Narrator: Alex and Steve are at the halfway
point in their race against the weather.

16:08.456 --> 16:10.736
I got a load of groceries..

16:10.737 --> 16:13.712
Going to Inuvik, and I'm
going down the Dempster.

16:13.713 --> 16:19.413
I'm just leaving Klondike
Corner in a big cloud of snow.

16:22.663 --> 16:28.563
Narrator: Steve's in the lead truck
as they approach Hurricane Alley.

16:30.839 --> 16:33.959
Very difficult to see.

16:34.189 --> 16:36.616
Pretty wintery looking road, I'll tell ya.

16:36.617 --> 16:39.391
Narrator: But they may
have already lost the race

16:39.392 --> 16:42.255
as the storm starts to show its teeth.

16:46.671 --> 16:51.310
Yeah, I can only see whatever's 100 feet
in front of me because of blowing snow.

17:06.253 --> 17:07.819
We're not out in the open yet.

17:07.819 --> 17:13.720
We're still in amongst the trees
and it's blowing pretty good.

17:15.474 --> 17:18.123
That means that we haven't seen the worst.

17:18.124 --> 17:23.044
We'll see what happens
when we get out there.

17:30.290 --> 17:33.134
There's a few bigger
drifts on the road now.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.669
Narrator: As they pull
into Hurricane Alley,

17:35.670 --> 17:39.085
the winds have reached 80 miles per hour.

17:39.086 --> 17:40.983
See, this is not good.

17:40.984 --> 17:46.204
So I definitely gotta slow
down a little bit more.

17:50.268 --> 17:52.728
Holy [Bleep]!

17:53.187 --> 17:57.407
Keep an eye on those poles.
It's all we got.

17:57.408 --> 18:01.017
Narrator: Steve rolls forward
with only the Delineator

18:01.018 --> 18:04.738
poles keeping him on the road.

18:08.251 --> 18:12.331
I'm seeing a whole bunch of white.

18:14.008 --> 18:15.675
See, we're down to two.

18:15.676 --> 18:19.216
We're.. We're down to two.

18:22.315 --> 18:25.774
Yeah, I don't think this
is a very good idea.

18:25.775 --> 18:30.647
I can't see [Bleep] at all.
This is.. This is bad.

18:30.648 --> 18:35.692
Narrator: Steve searches for the road
while Alex seeks his own guidance.

18:35.693 --> 18:37.449
I should say a prayer..

18:37.450 --> 18:40.844
Dear God, give us a hand with this trip.

18:40.845 --> 18:43.086
Bless this day.

18:43.087 --> 18:48.427
Protect me from harm.
Give me direction and guidance.

18:52.521 --> 18:55.581
I can't see nothing.

18:57.719 --> 19:02.039
This is nuts, man. This is total nuts.

19:02.631 --> 19:05.846
Bless Steve, my convoy partner.

19:05.847 --> 19:08.367
Keep us safe.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.618
I can't see nothing.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.079
Holy [Bleep].

19:16.318 --> 19:19.138
[Suspenseful music]

19:22.435 --> 19:25.135
This is [Bleep].

19:26.690 --> 19:29.870
Jesus, I trust in you.

19:30.663 --> 19:32.936
Where are we? I'm off the road?

19:32.937 --> 19:34.284
No.

19:34.285 --> 19:35.959
Jesus, I trust in you.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.976
I don't see nothing.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.157
Jesus, I trust in you.

19:42.095 --> 19:44.893
Okay, to the right.
To the right, to the right.

19:44.894 --> 19:46.495
Can't see a thing. I can't see a thing.

19:49.736 --> 19:52.283
- There, to the right.
- Whoa!

19:52.284 --> 19:53.336
Narrator: Coming up..

19:53.337 --> 19:57.486
The older it gets, this iron gets brittle.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.601
Narrator: Darrell's load fights back.

20:00.602 --> 20:03.062
Holy [Bleep].

20:06.016 --> 20:09.196
Narrator: Yukon, Canada.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.590
Jesus, I trust in you.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.762
I don't see nothing.

20:17.763 --> 20:20.970
Jesus, I trust in you, amen.

20:20.971 --> 20:23.164
Where are we? I'm off the road?

20:23.165 --> 20:24.360
No.

20:25.875 --> 20:29.658
Can't see a thing. I can't see at thing.

20:29.659 --> 20:31.579
Whoa!

20:31.848 --> 20:34.008
Hang on.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.296
Narrator: Alex and convoy partner Steve,

20:36.297 --> 20:42.197
are fighting a massive whiteout
in the middle of Hurricane Alley.

20:45.462 --> 20:49.160
I've gotten too close to Steve.

20:49.161 --> 20:51.381
Oh, crap.

20:54.509 --> 20:58.124
I can't see nothing.
See a pole? See a pole?

20:58.125 --> 21:01.606
See a pole? I don't see nothing.

21:01.607 --> 21:04.367
Can you see one?

21:07.810 --> 21:10.810
This is a nightmare.

21:16.424 --> 21:19.904
Where in the dickens am I?

21:20.644 --> 21:22.984
Oh [Bleep].

21:33.815 --> 21:35.448
See a pole?

21:48.509 --> 21:49.842
Okay, Alex, I'm stopped.

21:58.542 --> 22:02.944
Narrator: Unable to press forward
through the blinding whiteout.

22:02.945 --> 22:05.796
And not even sure they're
still on the road..

22:08.384 --> 22:14.084
Narrator: The veterans are
stranded as the storm rages on.

22:14.673 --> 22:17.913
370 miles to the west..

22:18.227 --> 22:20.331
Yeah, just headed northbound.

22:20.332 --> 22:23.998
Over the hills and through the
woods to Prudhoe Bay we go.

22:23.999 --> 22:26.300
Narrator: Darrell's made
it to the north slope.

22:26.301 --> 22:30.054
After leaving Jack in the dust last night.

22:30.055 --> 22:32.020
I'm all about load count.

22:32.021 --> 22:36.711
So stay out of my way, Jack Jessee,
because I will sack your ass.

22:36.712 --> 22:40.132
Again and again and again.

22:40.309 --> 22:42.913
Narrator: He's just an
hour from Prudhoe Bay,

22:42.914 --> 22:47.234
but his old trailer might not make it.

22:48.028 --> 22:50.488
Holy [Bleep].

22:56.613 --> 23:01.173
Man, this trailer's in pretty tough shape.

23:02.004 --> 23:05.438
The older it gets, this iron gets brittle.

23:05.439 --> 23:08.739
Can't handle the stress.

23:10.098 --> 23:14.131
Narrator: Here the temperatures
plunge to 45 below.

23:14.132 --> 23:20.032
And the truck's getting knocked around
by frost heaps that cover the road.

23:21.309 --> 23:23.649
[Bleep] Me.

23:24.988 --> 23:28.228
[Bleep] Is buckling now.

23:29.457 --> 23:31.977
[Metal creaks]

23:32.574 --> 23:37.981
If anything's gonna break this trailer
in half, it'll be this [Bleep] trip.

23:37.982 --> 23:43.022
65 miles of frost-eaten
and rough-ass ice road.

23:43.240 --> 23:46.641
Narrator: In the extreme
cold, metal turns brittle.

23:46.642 --> 23:50.742
And with the rugged road taking
its toll on the old trailer,

23:50.743 --> 23:53.388
one bad bump could crack it in two.

23:53.389 --> 23:57.829
And send Darrell's truck out of control.

24:00.667 --> 24:06.567
Might have to slow her down, or
we're never gonna make it there.

24:07.911 --> 24:11.600
Just gonna have nurse it on
in and hope for the best.

24:11.601 --> 24:15.972
Don't wanna nurse it too slow.
Don't need old Jack or..

24:15.973 --> 24:21.193
Porkchop or anybody like
that to catch up with me.

24:30.357 --> 24:32.817
Holy [Bleep].

24:41.246 --> 24:44.359
Holy [Bleep], that'll break my trailer.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.953
[Bleep], dude.

24:45.954 --> 24:50.334
This [Bleep] trailer don't stand chance.

24:54.154 --> 24:57.251
You know, that's all I need is this
trailer to go to [Bleep] on me,

24:57.252 --> 25:01.512
and end up sitting on the road here.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.826
Hoping it makes it.

25:04.827 --> 25:07.826
Keep my fingers crossed.

25:07.827 --> 25:10.227
Pretty ugly.

25:15.205 --> 25:19.165
Narrator: 150 miles to the south..

25:20.159 --> 25:23.049
Heading to Prudhoe, then I'm gonna
try to head back to Coldfoot,

25:23.050 --> 25:26.230
see what happens today.

25:26.485 --> 25:29.750
Narrator: Porkchop's on his
third solo run of the season,

25:29.751 --> 25:35.651
trying to get back into the load count
race with a load of construction gravel.

25:36.051 --> 25:38.135
Who knows what the Atigun
is gonna hold for us.

25:38.136 --> 25:43.902
It's probably greasier than greased
cookie sheet on a Thanksgiving evening.

25:43.903 --> 25:49.042
Narrator: He's driven over
300 miles without a problem.

25:49.043 --> 25:52.418
Got my lockers in. Here we go.

25:52.419 --> 25:58.319
Narrator: But now he's gotta get his
heaviest load of the season up Atigun Pass.

25:59.462 --> 26:02.222
So far, so good.

26:06.918 --> 26:10.938
Whoa! Little bit of slippage there.

26:12.230 --> 26:17.378
When you catch a good groove, hopefully
we won't slide over the edge.

26:17.379 --> 26:20.499
Hopefully, it'll hold.

26:26.796 --> 26:30.396
Human factor? No, you can't stop the Chop.

26:30.397 --> 26:34.357
God factor? Any time he wants to.

26:39.044 --> 26:44.564
Come on, Kitty Kenworth.
Climb on up to the top, baby.

26:46.063 --> 26:50.477
Holy [Bleep].
Here she comes again, damn it.

26:50.478 --> 26:54.812
Narrator: Porkchop's drive wheels are
slipping on the ice-covered slope.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.273
Almost there.

27:05.342 --> 27:08.021
Three gears in less than 100 yards, baby.

27:08.022 --> 27:10.362
Four gears.

27:12.358 --> 27:16.138
Come on, girl. Pull this bitch.

27:24.294 --> 27:28.183
And that's how you go
to the top of the rock.

27:28.184 --> 27:33.004
Narrator: The South Carolina
Native crests the pass.

27:33.005 --> 27:35.573
Southbound dropping off Atigun.

27:35.574 --> 27:39.544
Narrator: And he's starting to
show he can handle the haul road.

27:39.545 --> 27:42.527
Nothing to do but sit back and
enjoy the ride to the bottom.

27:42.528 --> 27:46.188
Hopefully, it's a smooth one.

27:49.107 --> 27:51.037
Narrator: Coming up..

27:52.645 --> 27:54.610
Narrator: Lost in a whiteout.

27:54.611 --> 27:59.111
This is why they call it Hurricane Alley.

28:01.777 --> 28:04.956
Narrator: Northern Canada..

28:04.957 --> 28:07.519
Hurricane Alley.

28:07.520 --> 28:11.465
We're stuck at, uh. Just north of 460.

28:11.466 --> 28:13.762
Can't see a thing.

28:13.763 --> 28:15.958
Narrator: Alex and convoy partner Steve,

28:15.959 --> 28:20.639
are stranded hundreds of
miles from civilization.

28:26.932 --> 28:30.238
This why the call it Hurricane Alley.

28:30.239 --> 28:36.139
Narrator: Alex walks into the
whiteout, trying to find the road.

28:41.478 --> 28:45.498
Narrator: But the Dempster is gone.

29:39.653 --> 29:42.544
Narrator: Getting disoriented
in the blinding snow

29:42.545 --> 29:47.525
is the biggest danger of
walking in a whiteout.

29:47.690 --> 29:53.590
And at 25 below, they got just
minutes before frostbite sets in.

30:02.257 --> 30:05.137
Well, there ya go.

30:23.312 --> 30:25.772
[Groans] Ah..

30:42.799 --> 30:47.388
Narrator: Unable to find any sign
of the road, they're stuck here.

30:47.389 --> 30:51.423
But they'll only stay warm as
long as their fuel holds out.

30:51.424 --> 30:55.444
There's Ice Road Trucking for you.

30:56.552 --> 31:00.452
Narrator: 200 miles to the west..

31:00.791 --> 31:04.517
Well, here I am. Coming into Prudhoe Bay.

31:04.518 --> 31:09.403
Narrator: Darrell makes it out of the
harsh north slope into Prudhoe Bay.

31:09.404 --> 31:14.505
My trailer held together, didn't buckle
in half on me, made pretty good time.

31:14.506 --> 31:18.928
Get in here and get rid of this load,
drop this trailer off and uh..

31:18.929 --> 31:23.729
Dispatch up a back haul
and head back south.

31:35.035 --> 31:37.375
Woo, doggy.

31:38.061 --> 31:40.971
Here we go. Just like that.

31:40.972 --> 31:45.592
See if I can get away from it right here.

31:49.786 --> 31:55.634
Narrator: Already on top of the load count,
a back haul here will keep him in the lead.

31:55.635 --> 31:58.247
- What's going on?
- Not too much.

31:58.248 --> 32:01.668
You have something for me?

32:01.744 --> 32:03.930
- Got you a bus.
- A bus? Like, what kind of bus?

32:03.931 --> 32:07.144
Like a bus bus like a people-hauling bus.

32:07.145 --> 32:08.782
Better than bob-tailing, that's for sure.

32:08.783 --> 32:11.423
- Yeah.
- Cool.

32:11.454 --> 32:13.044
- I'm gonna get out of here..
- All righty.

32:13.045 --> 32:14.937
Before anybody else shows
up looking for me.

32:14.938 --> 32:16.611
Sounds good. Have fun with that bus.

32:16.612 --> 32:19.072
Yeah, thanks.

32:20.163 --> 32:24.025
I'm gonna go get the hell out of here
before Jack Jessee even shows up, you know?

32:24.026 --> 32:27.214
By the end of the week, I'm gonna lap him.

32:27.215 --> 32:30.035
[Truck horn beeps]

32:30.054 --> 32:34.014
Narrator: 185 miles to the south..

32:34.568 --> 32:38.169
We just pulled out of Coldfoot.
A good night's rest.

32:38.170 --> 32:43.083
Narrator: Jack's back on the road after
getting passed last night by Darrell.

32:43.084 --> 32:46.373
I think Darrell's all about
winning the load count, for sure.

32:46.374 --> 32:49.792
But, you know, sometimes it's not
about the load count out here.

32:49.793 --> 32:54.591
It's about making good decisions.
If you make the wrong decision out here..

32:54.592 --> 32:57.832
You could kill somebody.

33:00.069 --> 33:02.654
I've got this heavy load of fuel. I gotta..

33:02.655 --> 33:05.795
You know, I've got Atigun Pass coming up.

33:05.796 --> 33:09.467
And I'm grossing about
104,000 pounds right now.

33:09.468 --> 33:13.788
And I've gotta pull that up the hill.

33:24.922 --> 33:28.829
The first half of this
challenge to get up the hill.

33:28.830 --> 33:32.670
I'm gonna have to change gears.

33:33.205 --> 33:35.665
There we go.

33:35.825 --> 33:40.685
It's amazing how steep
these things are here.

33:55.357 --> 33:58.128
Feels good. We just made it to the top.

33:58.129 --> 34:00.776
Narrator: Jack crests
the pass, but with his

34:00.777 --> 34:04.303
heavy load, the challenge has just begun.

34:04.304 --> 34:08.478
Now that I made it up the hill,
now I gotta go down the hill.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.830
All right, here we go.

34:09.831 --> 34:15.280
Narrator: The north face of Atigun
descends at an alarming 13% grade.

34:15.281 --> 34:18.917
If you spin out going uphill, you have
to worry about sliding backwards.

34:18.918 --> 34:22.134
When you get caught going
downhill, you don't stop.

34:22.135 --> 34:24.054
You just start picking up speed.

34:24.056 --> 34:26.944
Then you keep going and going.

34:26.945 --> 34:30.732
Narrator: He's gotta keep the
82,000-pound tanker from

34:30.733 --> 34:35.833
pushing his 22,000-pound
truck down the mountain.

34:36.521 --> 34:39.123
Man, this road is slick.

34:39.125 --> 34:44.585
Narrator: And one mistake
will send him over the edge.

34:47.539 --> 34:50.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:55.161 --> 34:56.743
Okay.

34:56.744 --> 34:59.381
Maybe lost traction there
for a second, but..

34:59.382 --> 35:05.282
Must have found some more because it
caught back up underneath it again.

35:10.172 --> 35:12.382
Pushing me.

35:12.383 --> 35:16.043
Whoa, come on, baby, come on.

35:22.815 --> 35:25.575
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

35:26.912 --> 35:30.889
Well, there we go. Good God.
Come on, get back underneath it.

35:30.890 --> 35:33.224
Hear the motor dying down?
That means I'm sliding.

35:33.225 --> 35:37.305
Come on straight, straight, straight.

35:38.295 --> 35:41.115
Come on, come on.

35:43.398 --> 35:46.170
Good God, come on. Get back underneath it.

35:46.171 --> 35:48.606
No, no, no, no.

35:48.607 --> 35:52.147
Crap. We're out of control.

35:57.023 --> 36:01.295
Narrator: Halfway down the north
face of ice-crusted Atigun Pass..

36:01.296 --> 36:03.812
Good God, come on, get back underneath it.

36:03.813 --> 36:07.251
Narrator: Jack fights for
control of the 82,000-pound

36:07.252 --> 36:09.423
tanker pushing him down the mountain.

36:09.424 --> 36:14.644
Come on. Come on.
Oh, crap, we're out of control.

36:15.009 --> 36:17.804
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Come on.

36:17.805 --> 36:23.705
Straight, straight, straight. Come on..
Crap, I'm gonna grab the gear.

36:27.623 --> 36:33.323
Got to get our speed up going
downhill when you lose it.

36:36.024 --> 36:40.284
Come on. There we go. Stay behind me.

36:40.938 --> 36:45.078
Come on. Stay underneath there, okay.

36:52.793 --> 36:56.093
I think we're good now.

36:56.974 --> 37:01.054
Yeah, I got it under control again.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.254
There is nothing worse than
losing traction going downhill.

37:06.255 --> 37:09.035
Because all you do is speed up.

37:09.036 --> 37:13.643
And the only way to get out from underneath
it and to catch it is to go faster.

37:13.644 --> 37:17.409
And that's not what you
wanna do going downhill.

37:17.410 --> 37:20.170
[Sighs] Oh, Lord.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.040
Almost didn't catch that.

37:31.900 --> 37:34.720
It's a bad deal.

37:36.556 --> 37:39.436
So bad of a deal.

37:43.812 --> 37:47.112
[Bleep] I'm getting out.

37:59.174 --> 38:05.074
That mountain over there is definitely
not something to mess with, now.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.187
Narrator: 160 miles to the north..

38:16.188 --> 38:20.335
Get this trip over with and get her done.
You know, almost there.

38:20.336 --> 38:25.747
Narrator: Porkchop's finally hitting his
stride as he chalks up another load.

38:25.748 --> 38:31.648
Get on up here and getting this load
off and get another one and head back.

38:40.035 --> 38:41.895
Woo!

38:43.801 --> 38:46.300
Feels good to have made it.

38:46.301 --> 38:49.971
Still in the game. I'm not down.
I just scored another touchdown.

38:49.972 --> 38:52.565
Fourth quarter ain't here and
the last whistle ain't blowed.

38:52.566 --> 38:56.466
Don't count me out. I got this.

38:58.236 --> 39:01.424
Let's go see what dispatch has to offer.

39:01.425 --> 39:07.185
Narrator: And a back haul here
will keep his streak going.

39:08.136 --> 39:10.655
- What's up, man?
- What's going on there Porkchop?

39:10.656 --> 39:11.796
What you got?

39:11.797 --> 39:16.064
Gonna have to send you
bobtail back to Fairbanks.

39:16.065 --> 39:18.128
I got nothing for you, man.

39:18.129 --> 39:20.506
Is there any wait or anything?

39:20.507 --> 39:22.307
No.

39:22.581 --> 39:24.214
All right.

39:24.215 --> 39:25.547
Wish I had something for you.

39:25.548 --> 39:29.028
- It happens. Later.
- Yep.

39:29.129 --> 39:33.314
Narrator: Now Porkchop
faces a 500-mile trip

39:33.315 --> 39:35.640
without a paying load.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.487
It's plain and simple.
Once again, if you ain't in the club..

39:38.488 --> 39:42.481
You ain't getting a back haul.
That's B.S. you know?

39:42.482 --> 39:46.685
I come up here to make money for my
family so I can get bills caught up.

39:46.686 --> 39:48.702
I don't have a silver spoon in my mouth.

39:48.703 --> 39:50.655
I've worked for every damn thing I've got.

39:50.656 --> 39:53.476
[Truck horn beeps]

39:55.015 --> 39:57.547
It is what it is.

39:57.548 --> 40:02.468
Narrator: As Porkchop
heads out, Jack pulls in.

40:02.932 --> 40:05.752
[Truck horns beep]

40:06.830 --> 40:09.202
Well, we just pullin' in to Prudhoe.

40:09.203 --> 40:14.248
All I gotta do is get offloaded
and I am out of here.

40:14.249 --> 40:19.020
Narrator: He's not ahead in the
load count, but he's alive.

40:19.021 --> 40:21.245
And at the end of the day..

40:21.246 --> 40:26.406
The Rocky Mountain log
hauler holds onto the lead.

40:28.710 --> 40:33.450
But back on the Dempster's
Hurricane Alley..

40:33.858 --> 40:37.747
You're all alone and it starts
to blow, and there you are..

40:37.748 --> 40:40.310
In the middle of a
snowstorm or a windstorm.

40:40.311 --> 40:45.207
Narrator: Alex and Steve have been
stranded for three hours at 25 below.

40:45.208 --> 40:49.888
Hoping their fuel supply
outlasts the storm.

41:16.464 --> 41:20.844
The grader showed up to save our hides.

41:39.632 --> 41:45.532
So now it's just a matter of whether we can
see as good the grader to get out of here.

41:51.794 --> 41:56.054
Give her heck. I'll be on your tail.

41:59.167 --> 42:02.393
Narrator: The veteran truckers
follow the grader's path.

42:02.394 --> 42:06.234
Before the road disappears again.

42:19.749 --> 42:21.840
How you making out back there, Alex?

42:23.799 --> 42:26.859
That's a good thing.

42:29.215 --> 42:32.751
Going up Border Hill. We're gonna be
crossing into the northwest territories.

42:32.752 --> 42:38.652
Steve and I managed to get through
by the skin of our teeth.

42:51.276 --> 42:53.580
Narrator: After two days on the road.

42:53.581 --> 42:58.023
Alex and Steve finally
deliver 110,000 pounds

42:58.024 --> 43:02.584
of food to the remote community of Inuvik.

43:06.527 --> 43:09.141
- Well old buddy, we made it.
- [Laughs]

43:09.142 --> 43:12.046
We got the loads here.
We didn't wreck no equipment.

43:12.047 --> 43:14.602
It's cold, it's snowing,
it's blowing, it's..

43:14.603 --> 43:16.003
Still winter.

43:16.004 --> 43:21.904
Which is good because that means the
ice is strong to haul more loads.

43:22.156 --> 43:26.536
Narrator: Next time on Ice Road Truckers..

43:26.749 --> 43:27.914
[Grunts]

43:27.915 --> 43:30.217
Narrator: Rick Yemm is back in the saddle.

43:30.218 --> 43:31.647
Aw, [Bleep].

43:31.648 --> 43:34.105
Narrator: And back in hot water.

43:34.106 --> 43:35.499
[Metal crashes]

43:35.500 --> 43:38.200
We hit a truck.

43:38.293 --> 43:41.210
Narrator: Austin's longest
load of the season..

43:41.211 --> 43:42.557
Oh, [Bleep]!

43:42.558 --> 43:44.810
Narrator: Could be his shortest trip.

43:44.811 --> 43:47.091
Please no.

43:47.762 --> 43:49.316
I need to talk to you for a sec.

43:49.317 --> 43:52.364
Narrator: And a veteran lays down the law.

43:52.365 --> 43:55.503
- You put me in a bad spot.
- That's B.S., man you know it.

43:55.504 --> 43:57.663
No, not up here it's not.
