00:55.766 --> 00:56.806
Hello?

01:08.264 --> 01:10.318
Okay, who the hell just used my can?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.570
The Projet-SG Team
presents

01:28.202 --> 01:32.365
Sanctuary Webisode 02

01:51.359 --> 01:57.344
http://projet-sg.net

02:32.361 --> 02:34.064
Station's closed, pal.

02:37.356 --> 02:39.582
Buddy, what the hell's going on?

02:46.317 --> 02:47.521
You know what?

02:47.603 --> 02:50.347
I don't want to know. You just stay put.

02:50.887 --> 02:53.244
Control 4, this is Rail check 2.

02:53.353 --> 02:55.128
I got a pick up on Southbound plateform.

03:00.355 --> 03:02.268
Some privacy if you please.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.221
We're just getting to know each other.

03:20.514 --> 03:22.319
I am so sick of that.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.571
Will my friend,

03:33.972 --> 03:36.041
you are on fire tonight.

04:20.232 --> 04:21.017
Good.

04:21.096 --> 04:22.296
You're awake.

04:23.968 --> 04:27.250
Considering I'm looking at
a photo of you and Joe Louis,

04:27.330 --> 04:28.700
I don't think so.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.100
I apologize for
my boldness this evening.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.009
Woman from earlier,

04:37.110 --> 04:39.764
creepy house, wacked photos.

04:39.942 --> 04:42.036
Probably working through
some childhood stuff?

04:42.132 --> 04:44.122
Bedwetting issues, night fears.

04:44.855 --> 04:47.012
Still, this is good stuff.

04:47.094 --> 04:48.598
Even for me.

04:52.129 --> 04:53.551
Dr Zimmerman.

04:53.715 --> 04:55.880
I assure you I am real,

04:55.975 --> 04:58.536
as is this place, and everthing in it.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.860
No, see, that's impossible.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.802
Because if this place is real
and I did pass out here,

05:08.899 --> 05:10.751
then that means that...

05:14.163 --> 05:15.205
Oh god...

05:19.802 --> 05:22.082
I love the dark.

05:22.498 --> 05:24.717
It's such a wonderful feeling.

05:24.813 --> 05:27.390
Letting the blackness envelop you,

05:29.064 --> 05:30.554
hide you,

05:31.433 --> 05:33.139
protect you from harm.

05:34.607 --> 05:38.405
I know all too well
what it is like to be different,

05:39.422 --> 05:42.456
to have others hate me,

05:42.994 --> 05:44.233
fear me...

05:47.181 --> 05:48.798
the way he fears you...

05:52.963 --> 05:55.318
Fulfill your desires,

05:56.082 --> 05:58.037
do your heart's content.

06:07.586 --> 06:09.155
With one condition.

06:10.801 --> 06:12.182
I need your help...

06:13.045 --> 06:15.423
to find an old friend.

06:33.029 --> 06:36.819
My manservant seems
to have a profound impact on you.

06:41.957 --> 06:45.697
Yeah, if you call fifteen years
of therapy down the drain profound.

06:46.732 --> 06:49.205
My patients and
I are unused to visitors.

06:49.301 --> 06:52.284
- We should have warned you, I suppose.
- That thing is your patient?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.252
Former patient actually.

06:54.368 --> 06:57.821
After I removed more than a few bullets
from his body, he refused to leave.

06:57.912 --> 06:59.957
So I gave him a position on my staff.

07:00.299 --> 07:03.719
And I must say he brews tea
as poorly as a short order cook.

07:04.994 --> 07:08.533
- He flushed me out of my shower.
- Did he use your toilet?

07:08.613 --> 07:10.982
That is so annoying.
I'll be sure to have a word with him.

07:11.062 --> 07:13.983
No, it's not the toilet flushing
that bothers me,

07:14.063 --> 07:15.531
it's the kidnapping.

07:15.647 --> 07:18.715
- And that fact that he's a...
- Well, he can't help who he is.

07:20.904 --> 07:22.429
Okay, you know what?

07:22.583 --> 07:25.417
This is been great, but I'm overdue
for a round of heavy drinking

07:25.497 --> 07:27.078
and some tranquilizers so...

07:28.380 --> 07:31.042
If I could just have my clothes, please.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.117
As you wish.

07:33.908 --> 07:35.856
But outside that door
are creatures that makes

07:35.953 --> 07:39.194
my buttler seems
like a housecat by comparison.

07:39.406 --> 07:41.954
Sanctuary for all is not an empty motto.

07:46.139 --> 07:47.355
A scone?

07:47.840 --> 07:49.788
Rail check 2, this is Blue Rider 9.

07:49.904 --> 07:50.946
Respond.

07:52.898 --> 07:54.481
Respond Rail check 2.

07:56.266 --> 07:57.347
Nothing.

07:57.771 --> 07:59.488
I hate this goddamn sector.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.661
No one likes working under the old city.

08:03.043 --> 08:04.897
Too many bad memories.

08:05.978 --> 08:07.591
Well if this guy caught an Express

08:07.671 --> 08:10.359
he could be up in Gunns Landing
for all we know, or

08:10.460 --> 08:11.828
friggin Sentinel Green...

08:11.908 --> 08:15.137
We've been checking the switches
on the number 4 line, near 149th.

08:15.234 --> 08:18.212
- I'm thinking he didn't go far.
-  Yeah, yeah.

08:20.643 --> 08:22.977
Yeah, I'm thinking you're right.

08:26.699 --> 08:29.176
So you're a doctor of what exactly?

08:29.737 --> 08:32.068
It depends on the patient of course.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.056
Of course!

08:35.164 --> 08:38.258
You spent eight years
of your life studying medecine...

08:38.354 --> 08:39.476
for what?

08:39.945 --> 08:42.509
So you could practice a profession
that has almost nothing to do

08:42.589 --> 08:44.784
with the reality
of the world around you?

08:45.773 --> 08:48.915
How about a little context
with that character assassination?

08:49.366 --> 08:50.515
That,

08:50.595 --> 08:52.107
I can provide.

08:57.589 --> 09:00.613
I specialize in teralogy,
among other things ...

09:01.183 --> 09:02.716
I'm sorry, teralogy?

09:03.071 --> 09:07.272
... combined with healthy doses of
cryptozoology and xenobiology as well,

09:07.388 --> 09:08.975
when the need arises.

09:19.298 --> 09:20.324
Please.

10:23.669 --> 10:26.558
Teralogy, from the greek "teras"

10:26.787 --> 10:29.541
meaning hideous creature, deformity,

10:30.053 --> 10:31.457
unknown being.

10:44.881 --> 10:46.099
New guy.

10:48.452 --> 10:49.494
Hey!

10:49.808 --> 10:50.622
New guy.

10:52.635 --> 10:53.675
New guy...

10:54.082 --> 10:55.122
New guy!

10:55.245 --> 10:57.353
Stop it! Both of you.

11:01.849 --> 11:04.716
I apologize. They're incorrigible.

11:05.529 --> 11:06.816
None of these...

11:07.068 --> 11:09.394
things are running around free, right?

11:09.476 --> 11:11.236
Don't be ridiculous.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.287
Exercice time isn't for
another two hours.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.386
The purpose of this institute
is to find and help

11:18.481 --> 11:20.805
the unfortunate creatures of this world.

11:22.018 --> 11:23.233
Dr Zimmerman,

11:23.330 --> 11:26.552
I believe there is a vital role
for you to play here.

11:28.558 --> 11:31.209
You want me to help you
capture monsters?

11:31.325 --> 11:33.524
I prefer to call them abnormals.

11:33.814 --> 11:34.855
Please.

11:39.435 --> 11:41.403
You find my offer amusing.

11:42.194 --> 11:44.509
- Yes.
- Because you're afraid.

11:45.655 --> 11:47.469
You work with monsters.

11:47.622 --> 11:49.768
I work with sentient beings.

11:49.973 --> 11:52.033
each worthy of
the same respect that humans,

11:52.113 --> 11:53.868
even animals, receive automatically.

11:55.284 --> 11:58.431
They are the key to the
evolution of our race.

11:58.526 --> 11:59.730
And yet we revile them,

11:59.977 --> 12:01.188
destroy them.

12:02.091 --> 12:03.445
And worst of all,

12:03.964 --> 12:05.853
pretend they don't even exist.

12:06.901 --> 12:09.175
But they are out there Dr Zimmerman,

12:09.255 --> 12:11.222
lost, like children,

12:11.319 --> 12:13.239
misunderstood, hunted.

12:13.672 --> 12:16.700
Are they really so different from
the outcasts you treat every day?

12:19.095 --> 12:21.480
You knew Mr Tolson
was telling you the truth.

12:22.834 --> 12:26.228
And in that one moment, I saw that
you were capable of so much more.

12:26.866 --> 12:29.316
I believed some of his story.

12:29.592 --> 12:31.864
That doesn't make me
Jeckyll to your Hyde,

12:31.944 --> 12:34.881
- or whatever the right combo is.
-  Open your eyes.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.343
Good doctors come and go.

12:38.658 --> 12:42.748
But the really great ones have always
seen beyond the bounderies of science,

12:42.839 --> 12:44.391
beyond the known

12:46.156 --> 12:48.578
The great ones dare to believe

12:49.317 --> 12:51.289
in the unbelievable.

13:23.192 --> 13:24.735
He must be close.

13:24.870 --> 13:25.912
Who?

13:26.361 --> 13:27.730
Our quarry.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.195
So how did you know
the killer's next victim

13:39.291 --> 13:40.953
would be down here and not...
you know...

13:41.050 --> 13:42.082
up,

13:42.545 --> 13:43.953
uptown.

13:46.261 --> 13:47.920
I have my sources.

13:48.605 --> 13:50.411
Could you be a little more
cyptic please?

13:50.491 --> 13:53.814
Because I was starting to feel in the
loop there and we wouldn't want that.

13:53.911 --> 13:56.461
Our subject is unused to human contact.

13:56.942 --> 14:00.723
He would seek refuge in these
catacombs if only for the solitude.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.673
Plus I have a police scannner.

14:18.586 --> 14:21.693
And how did you know the victim
was the work of the subject.

14:21.808 --> 14:24.712
Because I had been tracking
the little dweeb all night.

14:24.792 --> 14:25.832
Hi.

14:26.681 --> 14:29.074
With very little success I'm afraid.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.783
Well, that's because
someone else was down here.

14:32.404 --> 14:33.717
Tall dude.

14:33.950 --> 14:37.083
Moves faster than me.
If that's possible.

14:39.398 --> 14:40.729
What did he look like?

14:41.231 --> 14:42.891
Old, trenchcoat...

14:43.931 --> 14:44.889
didn't see much.

14:45.038 --> 14:45.836
Guys!

14:55.137 --> 14:56.584
It's okay.

14:56.815 --> 14:57.857
It's okay.

15:03.512 --> 15:04.511
Stop!

15:04.761 --> 15:06.135
We need him alive.

15:09.081 --> 15:11.296
We want to help you.

15:13.773 --> 15:15.567
Do you undertsand me?

15:31.784 --> 15:33.596
Over here! Over here!

15:34.676 --> 15:36.363
Yeah. That's it. That's it.

15:36.768 --> 15:37.790
Okay.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.041
Easy.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.080
A little help here please.

15:54.252 --> 15:55.248
You okay?

15:55.441 --> 15:56.483
I'm fine.

15:57.003 --> 15:58.007
Far from it.

15:58.393 --> 16:00.826
This chaos was completely avoidable.

16:00.922 --> 16:02.941
Give me a break.
I've been avoiding cops, ghouls

16:03.021 --> 16:05.099
and god knows what else
in dark tunnels all night.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.095
I need food. I need a bath.

16:07.335 --> 16:09.026
I don't need a lecture.

16:09.341 --> 16:10.361
Okay, so I'm...

16:10.928 --> 16:12.708
getting that you two know each other.

16:12.788 --> 16:14.312
Dr Zimmerman,

16:14.392 --> 16:16.004
this is Ashley.

16:17.475 --> 16:18.962
My daughter.
