<i>The Secret Circle...</i>

00:01.736 --> 00:04.572
My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.573 --> 00:05.906
and for that I am so sorry.

00:05.974 --> 00:07.358
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:07.442 --> 00:09.693
but destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:09.778 --> 00:10.978
Hi. I'm Diana.

00:11.029 --> 00:12.496
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.

00:12.581 --> 00:14.165
- We're different.
- You're different.

00:14.249 --> 00:17.785
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.

00:17.836 --> 00:19.937
Here we have
real power now.

00:20.005 --> 00:21.672
A complete circle is 6.

00:21.757 --> 00:22.673
You complete
the circle.

00:22.758 --> 00:24.125
She's got the gift.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.510
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:26.578 --> 00:28.914
The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.493
This is part of the blade
that girl used to attack me.

00:32.046 --> 00:32.829
Cassie: That's it.

00:32.830 --> 00:33.829
The hunters.

00:33.854 --> 00:36.181
So the girl who attacked me
was a witch hunter.

00:36.256 --> 00:37.756
Cassie isn't like other witches,
Isaac.

00:37.807 --> 00:40.259
She's stronger.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.845
[All grunting]

00:44.630 --> 00:46.565
Henry?

00:46.632 --> 00:47.766
You shouldn't be here.

00:47.817 --> 00:49.401
Cassie has dark magic.

00:51.187 --> 00:52.154
No!

00:52.238 --> 00:53.739
[Screaming]

00:53.806 --> 00:55.691

01:09.756 --> 01:11.256
You Ok?

01:11.324 --> 01:13.705
Last time I was here,
I was drugged, kidnapped,

01:13.730 --> 01:14.930
and almost killed.

01:15.345 --> 01:16.595
I can take you home if--

01:16.662 --> 01:19.264
No. I'm ok.
[Door opens]

01:19.332 --> 01:20.466
Hey.

01:20.517 --> 01:21.633
Is your grandmother
home yet?

01:21.684 --> 01:23.886
No.

01:23.970 --> 01:25.678
I've tried calling her cell,
but nothing.

01:25.703 --> 01:27.189
Everyone else is here, though.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.224
Everyone except Melissa.

01:29.309 --> 01:31.310
Her mom's been worried
about her since Nick died.

01:31.361 --> 01:33.278
Took her out of town
for a while.

01:37.116 --> 01:40.686
- Hey.
Who invited Jake?

01:40.753 --> 01:43.739
Well, he's a part
of the circle.

01:43.823 --> 01:45.491
Jake was attacked
just like the rest of us.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.576
I keep feeling like the witch hunters
are going to come after us again.

01:47.660 --> 01:48.994
I don't think so.

01:49.045 --> 01:51.663
At the shipyard, I heard them
say they were leaving town.

01:51.714 --> 01:53.799
They didn't seem like
the type to give up easily.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.765
If they wanted us dead,
wouldn't they just come

01:55.790 --> 01:57.649
back and try again?

01:58.021 --> 01:59.598
Maybe they got scared off
by your good friend

01:59.623 --> 02:01.023
Luke getting torched.

02:01.207 --> 02:03.642
Did anybody see
what happened to him?

02:03.709 --> 02:05.594
I think it had
to do with me.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.515
When he was about
to kill you,

02:10.583 --> 02:13.218
I--I yelled out,
and the bottle broke,

02:13.269 --> 02:15.487
and it just--
it feel like I had done it.

02:15.555 --> 02:17.556
But we were surrounded
by iron and sulfur.

02:17.607 --> 02:19.891
The circle couldn't do magic.
We--we tried.

02:19.943 --> 02:22.494
She wasn't talking
about the circle.

02:22.562 --> 02:24.062
You did magic
by yourself?

02:24.113 --> 02:25.730
It seemed like it.

02:25.782 --> 02:28.750
Has that happened to anybody
else since you bound the circle?

02:28.835 --> 02:31.253
I wouldn't be here
if I could do magic by myself.

02:31.337 --> 02:32.838
This is amazing.

02:32.905 --> 02:34.590
Jake says it's possible
to learn individual magic.

02:34.657 --> 02:35.970
Jake says?

02:35.995 --> 02:38.323
Since when are you in
a "Jake says" place?

02:38.911 --> 02:41.847
I've tried to do small spells
since, but nothing works.

02:41.914 --> 02:43.582
Like setting more classmates
on fire?

02:43.633 --> 02:46.585
Faye--
Doe-ey orphan Annie

02:46.636 --> 02:47.803
breezes into town,

02:47.887 --> 02:50.055
acting like she doesn't
know the difference

02:50.106 --> 02:52.307
between witchcraft
and Santa Claus.

02:52.392 --> 02:54.726
And now, she's more powerful
than any of us.

02:54.794 --> 02:56.445
Hold on. Cassie might have saved
our lives last night.

02:56.529 --> 03:01.433
Or maybe it's all her fault
they're here in the first place.

03:01.484 --> 03:03.101
Psychos,
witch hunters, demons--

03:03.152 --> 03:06.438
they all started coming
after us after you came to town.

03:06.506 --> 03:08.040
Actually, it was after we bound
the circle.

03:08.107 --> 03:10.075
Which we didn't do
until after she arrived.

03:10.126 --> 03:11.793
I don't know if
this is going to help.

03:11.878 --> 03:13.378
Calvin, the guy
at the antique shop,

03:13.446 --> 03:15.998
he put this in my mailbox,
said it was important.

03:16.082 --> 03:17.949
Can I see that?

03:27.010 --> 03:29.595
I've never seen anything like these
symbols before.

03:29.646 --> 03:30.896
"J.B."?

03:30.963 --> 03:32.814
I think it stands for Jane Blake,
my grandma.

03:32.899 --> 03:33.982
She knows him.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.317
What did Calvin say
about it?

03:35.401 --> 03:38.970
Nothing. And I tried calling him,
but no answer.

03:39.022 --> 03:40.305
Sort of like
your grandmother.

03:40.356 --> 03:41.690
She definitely should have
been home by now.

03:41.774 --> 03:44.026
I'm thinking I'd better go up to
your grandfather's place.

03:44.110 --> 03:46.261
- Make sure she's Ok.
- I'll go with you.

03:46.329 --> 03:48.664
Wait a minute.
It's my family's house,

03:48.748 --> 03:50.916
and I'm the one that knows how
to get there.

03:50.983 --> 03:52.618
Maybe we should all go.

03:52.669 --> 03:56.305
The further we are from the
witch hunters, the better.

[Distant train whistle]

04:01.511 --> 04:03.679
[Metal clanging]

04:16.392 --> 04:19.511
Did you do something
to Jane Blake?

04:19.562 --> 04:22.447
No. After your failed attempt
on the circle,

04:22.515 --> 04:26.735
we've been forced
underground. Why?

04:26.819 --> 04:30.021
She went to see Henry Chamberlain.
And now, she's missing.

04:30.073 --> 04:33.858
Two elders, together.

04:33.910 --> 04:36.027
Could they be
practicing again?

04:36.079 --> 04:39.131
Cassie and the others are going to
the lake house to check on her.

04:39.198 --> 04:41.466
I'll go and see
what I can find out.

04:41.534 --> 04:44.753
They still trust you
after last night's attack?

04:44.837 --> 04:46.054
They're scared.

04:46.139 --> 04:49.007
No one's looking for a threat
inside the circle.

04:49.058 --> 04:51.059
Maybe Adam,
but I can handle him.

04:51.144 --> 04:53.211
Tell me he doesn't
have dark magic.

04:53.262 --> 04:55.564
I think Cassie's
the only one.

04:55.648 --> 04:59.101
You're intrigued by her.

04:59.185 --> 05:01.623
The closer I get to her,

05:01.648 --> 05:03.652
the closer I get to
knowing how to kill her.

Yeah?

Have you heard
from grandpa?

05:20.780 --> 05:23.549
Not recently. Why?

05:23.616 --> 05:25.634
Cassie says Jane went up
to see him, and now,

05:25.719 --> 05:28.087
she's not answering
her cell.

05:28.138 --> 05:30.159
Well, cell service up there
is a little iffy.

I'm sure they're fine.

05:32.475 --> 05:34.175
Cassie Blake is
all drama, all the time,

05:34.176 --> 05:35.708
and she wants to drive
out there and check.

And it's our lake house, so.

and study.

It's just for the day.

05:46.189 --> 05:47.573
Faye, it's
a 3-hour drive.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.475
And I've driven it
by myself how many times?

05:50.527 --> 05:53.312
If it makes you feel any better,
a bunch of us are going.

05:53.363 --> 05:55.331
I'm sure your grandfather
doesn't want to deal with

05:55.415 --> 05:56.699
a car full of teenagers.

05:56.783 --> 06:00.035
Mom,
what's the big deal?

06:01.487 --> 06:04.506
No a big deal.
Just be safe.

06:04.591 --> 06:06.709
I will call as soon
as I get there.

06:06.793 --> 06:10.796
And I'll tell grandpa
you say hi, and you miss him.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.067
Jake's supposed
to give me a ride.

06:32.152 --> 06:35.070
Jake and Cassie are neighbors.
I told them to go together.

06:35.155 --> 06:36.584
I'm impressed.

06:36.585 --> 06:38.270
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means even though

06:38.273 --> 06:40.058
you and Adam gave back
your promise rings,

06:40.227 --> 06:42.328
you still want the competition
in the other car.

06:42.379 --> 06:43.663
Convenient.

06:43.714 --> 06:44.931
Did you reach Henry?

06:44.998 --> 06:48.501
No, but unlike Cassie,
I'm not freaking out.

06:48.552 --> 06:51.337
He lives in a house
on 200 acres

06:51.388 --> 06:53.339
where he still chops
his own wood.

06:53.390 --> 06:55.692
Hardly the kind of guy
who waits by the phone.

06:55.776 --> 06:57.510
I'm sure he's fine.

07:01.565 --> 07:02.564
Where are you?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.102
We have a situation
on our hands.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.536
Should be home soon.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.071
Do you have
Jane's phone?

07:08.155 --> 07:09.489
Pretty sure
it's in the back.

07:09.540 --> 07:10.990
Look, I need you
to text Cassie

07:11.041 --> 07:12.992
and tell her that
Jane's home already.

07:13.043 --> 07:14.193
Why?

07:14.245 --> 07:15.695
She told Cassie she was going to
the lake house.

07:15.746 --> 07:17.247
The kids are headed up there
to check on her.

07:17.331 --> 07:19.916
When we made Henry's death look
like a heart attack,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.870
the idea was that the neighbor
would find him, not Faye.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.344
She won't.

07:25.369 --> 07:27.054
Jane was performing
a spell over his body

07:27.091 --> 07:28.591
when I got there,
and I didn't want to risk

07:28.676 --> 07:30.677
leaving behind
any signs of magic.

07:30.728 --> 07:34.547
No one will find
his body. I moved it.

07:34.598 --> 07:36.649
It's better with
the kids gone.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.719
It gives us time to figure out
what to do with Jane.

What gave it away--

07:54.568 --> 07:56.252
the clouds
or the thunder?

07:56.337 --> 07:59.505
I'm sure you're grandmother's
all right, Cassie.

07:59.573 --> 08:01.374
Sorry.

08:01.425 --> 08:03.593
I'm just a little short
on family members,

08:03.677 --> 08:06.212
so when one goes missing,
it stresses me out.

08:06.263 --> 08:09.682
I hear you.
I'm a little short myself.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.751
[Chuckles]

08:13.554 --> 08:16.272
I'm sorry.
No worries.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.980
You know, I see the way you
react when people talk about Nick.

08:24.064 --> 08:27.767
And you pretend not
to care, but you do.

08:27.818 --> 08:31.454
Yeah. I guess I wish
we'd reconnected sooner.

08:31.538 --> 08:35.291
I could've helped him deal with
everything, with witchcraft.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.794
I thought you didn't want him
getting into it.

08:37.878 --> 08:38.857
But he did.

08:38.881 --> 08:41.195
So maybe opening up
could've helped him

08:41.332 --> 08:44.417
understand who he was.

08:44.468 --> 08:45.988
How about you?

08:46.013 --> 08:48.060
Does Jane ever talk about
your family and magic?

08:48.839 --> 08:50.623
Not much.

08:50.674 --> 08:52.357
She said our family can
be traced back to the

08:52.382 --> 08:53.582
beginning of witchcraft.

08:55.295 --> 08:57.146
Mom or dad's side?

08:58.766 --> 09:00.075
Why are you suddenly
so interested in

09:00.100 --> 09:01.575
climbing my family tree?

09:03.103 --> 09:05.355
Old magic is powerful.

09:05.439 --> 09:07.190
Tracing it back
might help you understand

09:07.307 --> 09:11.160
why you're able
to do it on your own.

09:11.245 --> 09:14.414
Maybe those papers have
something to do with it.

09:14.481 --> 09:16.616
Maybe.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.502
I'll look at them again. Maybe
I can figure out what they say.

09:19.586 --> 09:23.122
I, uh--
I left them at home.

09:23.173 --> 09:26.826
Right now, I just--
I need to find my grandmother.

09:29.213 --> 09:31.497
Of course.

09:31.548 --> 09:34.217
And we're almost
there, anyway.

anyone's home.

a key under here.

Girl: Somebody,
please help me!

10:43.694 --> 10:47.197
Did anyone just hear
a little girl's voice?

10:47.281 --> 10:49.533
A little girl?
[Thunder]

10:49.617 --> 10:51.034
Never mind.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.203
[Clicks]

10:53.271 --> 10:55.322
No lights.

10:55.373 --> 10:56.990
Power goes out a lot
when it rains.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.543
There are some candles
in the chest right there.

11:03.464 --> 11:05.715
Grandpa?

11:07.068 --> 11:08.902
Grandpa?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.807
Doesn't seem like
anybody's here,

11:13.875 --> 11:17.210
unless your grandpa
likes to sit in the dark.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.985
Wow.
That's an old one.

11:26.737 --> 11:29.356
Hey, that's
my grandmother's scarf.

11:32.727 --> 11:34.878
Where could they have gone
in this weather?

11:34.946 --> 11:36.196
Maybe into town.

11:36.247 --> 11:37.447
Want to try
and call her again?

11:41.068 --> 11:44.404
Yeah. Well,
she--she texted me.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.442
"Cell service spotty here.
Stopped to see a friend on

11:46.467 --> 11:47.624
the way back from the lake.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.543
Be home tomorrow."
There you go.

11:49.594 --> 11:51.428
Now, no more
worrying tonight.

11:51.512 --> 11:53.746
Did she say anything
about my grandfather?

11:53.798 --> 11:56.249
No. But they
might be together.

11:56.317 --> 11:58.051
Ew.

11:58.102 --> 12:00.020
I'll go look for some food
in the kitchen.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.560
We can head back now,
if you want.

12:06.611 --> 12:09.112
I don't know.
It's still pouring,

12:09.196 --> 12:11.197
and Jane's not going to be
home until tomorrow, anyway.

12:11.265 --> 12:12.399
We may as well
stay the night.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.367
Great idea.

12:14.435 --> 12:16.603
There's a generator
in the shed out back.

12:16.654 --> 12:19.489
Maybe get that going,
get us some lights.

12:19.574 --> 12:22.375
And I'll go see what the old
man has in his liquor cabinet.

12:22.443 --> 12:23.710
Now you're talking.

12:24.996 --> 12:26.279
Are there any more
flashlights?

12:26.330 --> 12:27.947
Check under the sink
in the kitchen.

12:55.026 --> 12:57.243
[Thunder]

13:33.230 --> 13:35.065
[Gasps]

13:57.088 --> 13:58.538
[Door shuts]

13:58.589 --> 14:00.807
What the hell took you
so long?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.810
I've been
a little busy, Dawn.

14:03.877 --> 14:04.780
What did you do
with Jane?

14:04.781 --> 14:07.285
She's safe. Knocked out
with a few sleeping pills.

14:08.453 --> 14:10.408
She'll be out for
hours. Trust me.

14:10.409 --> 14:12.994
What are we going to do?

14:13.079 --> 14:16.031
What can we do?
We have no magic.

14:19.585 --> 14:21.753
Oh, my God.

14:21.821 --> 14:24.456
You found it.

14:24.507 --> 14:26.792
Actually, Jane did.

14:26.843 --> 14:30.262
Henry had it in
some hidden compartment.

14:30.329 --> 14:33.431
[Sighs]

14:33.499 --> 14:37.352
We've got to figure out
a way to control Jane's memory.

14:37.436 --> 14:39.688
We have the crystal.

14:39.772 --> 14:41.640
But we still need
a spell.

14:41.691 --> 14:44.893
And I know where
we can find one.

14:47.313 --> 14:50.065
You know, I think
Jake has a thing for you.

14:50.149 --> 14:53.652
[Thunder]
No. Definitely not.

14:55.988 --> 14:57.823
Really?

14:59.242 --> 15:00.358
Finally.

15:00.409 --> 15:03.461
I need a drink
or several.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.863
Thanks for sharing.

15:04.914 --> 15:06.665
I'm going to text my mom
before I get a buzz

15:06.716 --> 15:08.416
so she knows
we're staying the night.

15:08.501 --> 15:09.968
Then I'm going to take
a hot bath.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.536
I got soaked,
and I'm freezing.

15:11.587 --> 15:14.539
Come on. No applause?
We made light.

15:14.590 --> 15:17.375
Ah. Nice work.
Now we need a fire

15:17.426 --> 15:18.894
to get
this place warm.

15:18.978 --> 15:21.045
I'll be in the tub,
if you need me.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.815
Give me a hand
with drinks.

15:23.883 --> 15:24.983
I'll help.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.885
Sure.

15:33.943 --> 15:36.528
I know a better way
to start the fire.

15:36.579 --> 15:38.029
Oh, really.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.865
A spell.

15:39.916 --> 15:42.734
I don't know. Playing with fire,
and all that.

15:42.785 --> 15:43.735
Come on.

15:43.786 --> 15:45.453
[Grunts]

15:45.538 --> 15:48.573
Doing magic with someone can
tell you a lot about them.

15:48.641 --> 15:50.959
Like what?

15:51.043 --> 15:53.261
Let's try it and see.

15:53.346 --> 15:55.597
It won't hurt.
I promise.

15:55.681 --> 15:58.266
[Exhales]

15:58.351 --> 16:01.102
All right.

16:01.187 --> 16:03.388
From air to fire--

16:03.439 --> 16:05.223
No chanting.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.725
What?

16:06.776 --> 16:09.561
Just picture it.

16:09.612 --> 16:11.780
No words.

16:16.118 --> 16:18.286
[Inhales]

16:27.663 --> 16:29.781
[Gasps]

16:29.832 --> 16:31.833
Whoa.

16:32.952 --> 16:36.004
That was intense.

16:51.654 --> 16:53.488
Mmm.

17:06.752 --> 17:10.121
[Gasps]

17:10.172 --> 17:11.623
[Pants]

17:11.674 --> 17:13.458
[Screams]

17:13.509 --> 17:15.827
[Panting]

17:20.290 --> 17:24.210
Everything looks
normal.

17:24.294 --> 17:27.880
But it--it was filled
with mud and weeds.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.666
Maybe you had
a few sips too many.

17:29.717 --> 17:31.033
I'm not drunk.

17:31.085 --> 17:33.035
- Did you fall asleep?
- No.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.373
[Sighs] Forget the whole thing.
Just get out. Ok.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.059
Ok.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.599
Did you do this?

17:46.684 --> 17:47.900
What?

17:47.985 --> 17:49.819
You're the only one around
here with individual magic.

17:49.886 --> 17:52.572
You said it yourself.
The voices, the boots.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.824
What are you
talking about?

17:54.891 --> 17:56.726
Are you messing
with me?

17:56.777 --> 17:59.696
Maybe trying
to make me look crazy

17:59.747 --> 18:00.947
so you can have Jake
all to yourself?

18:01.031 --> 18:02.331
Faye,
you're being ridiculous.

18:02.399 --> 18:04.900
I didn't do anything.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.758
[Groans]

18:22.523 --> 18:25.391
This is where I followed them
after the binding ceremony.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.562
You sure
they're not coming back?

18:29.646 --> 18:33.449
Yeah. Faye's text said they
were all spending the night.

18:35.352 --> 18:38.154
"Crowley's 777,"

18:38.205 --> 18:41.791
"Holden's Spellcraft."
They've got the basics.

18:41.858 --> 18:46.348
Look at all of this.
Plants, herbs, tools.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.354
Takes me back to earlier days,

18:49.355 --> 18:52.941
when we started hanging out
together, learning the craft.

18:53.026 --> 18:57.112
Yes, before Blackwell.

18:57.197 --> 18:59.448
When it was still fun.

19:05.155 --> 19:07.606
Diana doesn't keep her book
at home anymore.

19:07.657 --> 19:12.027
After the circle was bound,
she kept it close.

19:12.095 --> 19:15.631
But a group trip,
in a car...

19:15.715 --> 19:17.311
If I know my daughter,

19:17.336 --> 19:19.156
she'd would have left it
safely behind,

19:19.302 --> 19:21.386
where the others
couldn't get to it.

19:26.593 --> 19:31.647
Umbra libre invenio.

19:33.983 --> 19:37.820
Umbra libre invenio.

19:38.988 --> 19:42.157
Umbra libre...

19:59.509 --> 20:01.293
[Scoffs]

20:01.344 --> 20:03.078
Impressive.

20:03.146 --> 20:05.347
We should take
the book with us.

20:05.431 --> 20:07.216
We'll make sure it's back before
the kids return.

20:07.300 --> 20:11.336
No. We'll find
the spell we need,

20:11.387 --> 20:15.474
but this is where Diana puts
her book for safekeeping,

20:15.525 --> 20:17.526
and this is
where it stays.

20:22.282 --> 20:24.983
You should give me
the crystal now, Charles.

20:25.034 --> 20:27.519
- I'll hold onto it.
- I don't think so.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.206
You haven't been
yourself lately, Charles,

20:31.291 --> 20:34.526
which is completely
understandable.

20:34.577 --> 20:37.496
But I think it's for the best,
for both of us,

20:37.547 --> 20:39.965
if I keep the crystal.

20:42.802 --> 20:46.555
I was upset
after Nick's death.

20:46.639 --> 20:49.141
But I found this crystal,

20:49.209 --> 20:52.077
and it gives me hope that things
can get put back on track.

20:53.336 --> 20:57.258
So please, don't talk to me like
I'm one of your students, Dawn.

20:57.717 --> 20:59.301
I don't like it.

20:59.369 --> 21:03.555
This time,
the crystal stays with me.

21:03.606 --> 21:05.991
This time,
I do what I want.

21:06.058 --> 21:09.027
You don't stop me.

21:09.913 --> 21:13.081
Within reason,
of course.

21:17.453 --> 21:20.071
[Music playing]
So, Diana...

21:20.123 --> 21:22.674
Truth or dare?

21:22.742 --> 21:24.676
I cannot believe
we're doing this.

21:24.744 --> 21:26.912
First of all,
there's no TV or Internet.

21:26.963 --> 21:30.048
And second, what better way
to get to know each other?

21:31.417 --> 21:33.919
Truth or dare?

21:33.970 --> 21:35.971
Dare.

21:36.055 --> 21:37.756
Hmm.

21:38.925 --> 21:40.475
I dare you to

21:40.560 --> 21:43.812
take your shirt off
for the next 3 questions.

21:43.897 --> 21:45.564
Loosen up a little.

21:45.615 --> 21:47.532
- No way.
- That's no fair.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.285
Well, the game's not
called truth or fair.

21:50.370 --> 21:52.371
Are you going
to play or not?

21:56.826 --> 21:59.995
[Laughter]

22:01.113 --> 22:02.331
Cheating.

22:02.415 --> 22:04.716
This doesn't seem
like a good idea.

22:04.784 --> 22:07.052
My turn. Faye,
truth or dare.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.303
Truth.

22:08.388 --> 22:10.789
How many people have
you slept with?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.341
How about
a dare instead?

22:12.425 --> 22:14.226
[Chuckles] Those aren't
the rules, Faye.

22:14.293 --> 22:15.560
Do you want
to play or not?

22:15.628 --> 22:18.129
Fine.

22:19.849 --> 22:22.467
Two.

22:22.518 --> 22:24.987
Ooh, guess I'm not
the super-slut

22:25.054 --> 22:28.323
you all think I am.
Or I'm lying.

22:28.408 --> 22:30.075
Who's next?
How about--

22:30.142 --> 22:32.811
Jake.
Truth or dare.

22:32.862 --> 22:34.479
Bring it.

22:34.530 --> 22:37.482
[Thunder]

22:37.533 --> 22:40.318
Truth.

22:40.370 --> 22:43.255
Why didn't
the witch hunters put you

22:43.322 --> 22:45.090
in the circle
with the rest of us?

22:45.157 --> 22:47.659
Come on, Adam.
No witch hunter talk. Please.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.711
He already
explained that.

22:49.796 --> 22:52.798
Probably because I'm
stronger than the rest of you.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.716
Took more guys
to hold me down.

22:54.801 --> 22:56.301
[Chuckles]

22:57.937 --> 23:00.305
I don't believe you.

23:01.941 --> 23:04.526
Way bored
of macho tension.

23:04.610 --> 23:07.980
Moving on to...Cassie.

23:08.031 --> 23:10.482
Truth or dare?

23:10.533 --> 23:12.818
But truth is a two-parter.

23:12.869 --> 23:15.173
Do you ever plan
on going after a guy

23:15.198 --> 23:16.398
one of us hasn't slept with?

23:16.406 --> 23:18.991
Or is it just other people's
boyfriends that turn you on?

23:19.042 --> 23:20.042
Faye, shut up.

23:20.126 --> 23:21.793
Cassie can defend herself,
Adam.

23:21.861 --> 23:23.695
Dare.

23:23.746 --> 23:25.697
Better choice.

23:25.765 --> 23:29.334
I dare you to...

23:29.385 --> 23:30.752
Kiss Jake.

23:56.996 --> 23:59.397
[Thunder]

23:59.449 --> 24:00.665
[Clacks]

24:02.068 --> 24:05.504
You are a one-woman
relationship wrecking crew.

24:05.571 --> 24:07.405
And you are a bitchy,
spoiled little girl

24:07.457 --> 24:08.907
who wants to blame me
for all of your problems

24:08.958 --> 24:11.026
instead of just
looking in the mirror.

24:12.893 --> 24:14.894
[Scoffs]

24:18.214 --> 24:19.120
Diana: Faye!

24:19.145 --> 24:20.345
Just let her go.

24:28.074 --> 24:29.558
[Door shuts]

24:35.031 --> 24:37.199
[Panting]

24:54.739 --> 24:56.906
[Thunder]

25:11.781 --> 25:13.615
[Exhales]

25:31.333 --> 25:33.352
Oh!

25:33.436 --> 25:35.554
[Sighs]

25:52.071 --> 25:53.455
[Gasps]

25:53.522 --> 25:55.690
Pull back your claws.
I'm not Faye.

25:55.742 --> 25:59.044
Sorry. She just knows
how to push my buttons.

25:59.128 --> 26:00.996
That's what
Faye does best.

26:01.047 --> 26:03.832
What's the deal
with you two, anyway?

26:03.883 --> 26:06.802
What do you mean?
Nothing.

26:06.869 --> 26:10.505
She acts like you're still together.
Are you?

26:10.556 --> 26:13.341
No. Faye likes to think
our relationship was

26:13.393 --> 26:16.094
more interesting and complicated
than it was.

26:16.179 --> 26:18.480
I don't even think of it
as a relationship.

26:18.547 --> 26:20.148
Mmm.
Spoken like a true guy.

26:20.216 --> 26:21.483
[Chuckles]

26:21.550 --> 26:23.485
I like this side of you.

26:23.553 --> 26:25.854
You're cute
when you're angry.

26:25.905 --> 26:28.607
Spoken like
a true cheeseball.

26:31.944 --> 26:35.063
All that emotion swirling
inside you right now?

26:35.114 --> 26:38.050
Accessing that is
the key to solo magic.

26:38.117 --> 26:41.069
Anger, pain, passion.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.905
It's like rocket fuel.

26:43.956 --> 26:45.674
If that were true,
Faye would've bailed

26:45.741 --> 26:47.209
on the circle
a long time ago.

26:47.260 --> 26:49.795
Not all witches are
created equal.

26:49.879 --> 26:52.209
You can practice,
but true power is

26:52.234 --> 26:53.414
something you're born with.

26:53.415 --> 26:56.384
Like you were.

26:56.436 --> 26:58.103
I don't know that
for sure.

26:58.171 --> 27:01.723
I think you do.
Deep down.

27:01.774 --> 27:04.276
You're just afraid
to go there.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.351
You really are
a cheeseball.

27:13.419 --> 27:14.619
Not afraid?

27:14.704 --> 27:17.739
Try a spell on your own.

27:17.790 --> 27:21.960
Why do you care?

27:22.078 --> 27:24.663
Maybe
I'm just interested.

27:30.619 --> 27:32.787
Then show me.

27:34.790 --> 27:38.059
I've been accused of doing
a lot of things tonight.

27:38.127 --> 27:41.296
Maybe I should
try at least one of them.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.608
Cassie, stop.

27:56.329 --> 28:01.166
Um. I should go get
the rest of my stuff.

28:09.542 --> 28:11.710
[Crickets]

28:13.262 --> 28:14.513
Where are you going?

28:14.597 --> 28:16.131
To get firewood.

28:16.182 --> 28:19.518
Are you mad at me? Why?
I didn't do anything.

28:19.602 --> 28:21.353
You defended her.

28:21.437 --> 28:24.022
And you looked away 'cause you
couldn't handle seeing them kiss.

28:24.106 --> 28:25.807
I looked at you,
not away.

28:25.858 --> 28:27.508
I was trying to show you
how much I didn't care.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.566
If you really didn't care,
you wouldn't have to force

28:29.591 --> 28:31.369
yourself not to look.

28:31.614 --> 28:33.198
I know you, Diana.

28:33.282 --> 28:34.533
You set that up
on purpose.

28:34.617 --> 28:36.067
You think?

28:36.152 --> 28:37.702
Altering the fabric
of time and space

28:37.787 --> 28:39.538
to ensure your destiny
with Cassie?

28:39.622 --> 28:42.207
Oh, come on.

28:45.294 --> 28:46.995
Daring them to kiss.

28:47.046 --> 28:48.880
It doesn't matter
how I reacted.

28:48.965 --> 28:50.531
You just wanted
a reason to be angry.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.033
You think I like
feeling this way?

28:52.084 --> 28:53.635
I think you want
a reason to push me away.

28:53.702 --> 28:54.886
I shouldn't want to.

28:54.971 --> 28:56.421
That's not a good
relationship sign, is it?

28:56.505 --> 28:57.472
Just talk to me.

28:57.539 --> 29:00.926
Adam, you're just
used to us, that's all.

29:01.010 --> 29:03.544
That's why this is so important.
You're afraid of change.

29:03.596 --> 29:05.546
- That is pathetic.
- Excuse me?

29:05.598 --> 29:08.216
Cassie has made you feel
the tiniest bit of doubt

29:08.267 --> 29:10.051
for the first time
in your life,

29:10.102 --> 29:12.053
and it freaks you out
so much, you need

29:12.104 --> 29:13.321
to turn me into
an emotional loser?

29:13.389 --> 29:14.823
Screw you.
It's not Cassie

29:14.890 --> 29:16.524
who makes made me
feel insecure-- it's you.

29:16.576 --> 29:17.943
If you really
wanted me gone,

29:18.027 --> 29:19.578
you wouldn't have to try so
hard to convince yourself.

29:19.662 --> 29:20.829
Well, you're the only one
who needs convincing.

29:20.896 --> 29:22.364
You're the one
chasing me out here.

29:22.415 --> 29:24.232
Yes, I am.

29:26.735 --> 29:28.903
[Both panting]

29:50.092 --> 29:51.526
Faye?

29:51.593 --> 29:54.429
[Engine running]
You out here?

30:16.135 --> 30:17.969
Faye?

30:30.683 --> 30:32.183
Faye?

30:33.519 --> 30:36.304
[Gasps]

30:36.355 --> 30:39.357
Hi. Are you Ok?

30:42.478 --> 30:44.645
Hey, wait for me.

30:57.176 --> 30:58.460
[Gasps]

30:58.511 --> 31:00.428
Oh, my God, Faye.
You scared me.

31:00.496 --> 31:02.097
There's a little girl
out here.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.432
You could see her?

31:04.500 --> 31:06.301
Yes. Just a second ago.

31:06.352 --> 31:09.104
And there's a picture of her in
your grandfather's study.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.690
Who is she?

31:11.774 --> 31:14.476
She's...Me.

31:20.354 --> 31:21.521
I can't explain it.

31:21.738 --> 31:23.105
All I know is
that little girl is me.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.948
Come on, Faye.
That's not possible.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.283
I get that.

31:26.367 --> 31:29.770
But I remember the last time
I wore that exact outfit.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.104
Those boots,
that raincoat.

31:31.156 --> 31:34.107
I was 6, I was here
for the summer, and...

31:34.159 --> 31:36.210
I wandered out down
to the lake by myself.

31:36.277 --> 31:37.411
Faye, it's not you.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.830
It's dark. It's late.
It's been a weird night.

31:39.914 --> 31:41.665
I was throwing rocks
into the lake,

31:41.750 --> 31:44.501
and I walked out onto the dock so
I could throw them even further.

31:44.586 --> 31:46.920
And I was standing
right up to the edge--

31:46.971 --> 31:48.422
Let's go get
Adam and Diana.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.674
I reached back and threw one
as hard as I could,

31:50.759 --> 31:53.627
and then suddenly, I was
underwater, and I couldn't breathe.

31:53.678 --> 31:56.146
And then, I remember
trying to scream,

31:56.231 --> 31:58.649
and--and water rushing
into my lungs.

31:58.733 --> 32:00.317
I could feel my whole body
shutting down.

32:00.401 --> 32:02.936
And I remember
the panic.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.638
I was so scared.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.640
Faye. Please, stop.
Stop, stop.

32:06.691 --> 32:08.475
And then...

32:08.526 --> 32:10.644
there was
a hand on my arm.

32:10.695 --> 32:14.147
And I was yanked up
and thrown onto the dock.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.817
It was my grandfather.

32:16.868 --> 32:19.787
He saved my life.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.212
That girl is here
for a reason.

32:34.836 --> 32:39.556
I won't lie Jane.
I've never really liked you.

32:39.641 --> 32:42.843
And not just because you and
the elders took away our power--

32:42.894 --> 32:46.530
which, of course,
would be reason enough.

32:46.614 --> 32:50.350
Long before that,
I always found you to be

32:50.401 --> 32:54.254
smug and self-righteous.

32:54.322 --> 32:57.741
And dull.

32:57.826 --> 33:02.496
Which is why I'm so pleased
with this spell.

33:05.466 --> 33:08.335
I think that
after I'm able to control

33:08.386 --> 33:12.923
the things that
you say and do,

33:13.007 --> 33:15.976
we're going to be
great friends. Hmm?

33:16.043 --> 33:19.730
And isn't that what
it's all about? Friendship?

33:21.983 --> 33:25.485
I am sure you'll agree...

33:25.553 --> 33:27.387
in just a few minutes.

33:29.107 --> 33:31.057
[Thunder]

33:31.109 --> 33:32.726
[Panting]

33:32.777 --> 33:34.227
Faye, wait!

33:34.279 --> 33:35.896
[Splashes]

33:35.947 --> 33:38.282
- Did you hear that?
- What?

33:40.067 --> 33:41.501
She fell into the lake.

33:41.569 --> 33:43.871
Where are you?
Can you hear me?

33:43.922 --> 33:45.505
There's no one
out there.

33:45.573 --> 33:46.590
What's going on?

33:46.674 --> 33:48.759
She saw something
or someone.

33:48.843 --> 33:49.793
You saw her, too!

33:49.878 --> 33:51.211
- Saw what?
- I don't know.

33:51.262 --> 33:52.512
A little girl,
I think. Maybe.

33:52.580 --> 33:55.382
She fell in the water.
We have to find her.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.217
There's no one in there.
Let's go back inside.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.553
Wait! Let go of me!
She fell into the water.

33:59.604 --> 34:00.804
Faye,
whatever she is,

34:00.889 --> 34:02.806
she's not in the water, Faye.
I promise.

34:02.891 --> 34:05.392
Yes, she is! She fell in the water!
We have to find her!

34:05.443 --> 34:06.693
[Screams]
What's the matter?

34:06.761 --> 34:08.527
Get off me!
Get him off of me!

34:08.596 --> 34:10.030
Lay off.
Get him off me!

34:10.097 --> 34:11.364
All right,
let go of her!

34:11.431 --> 34:12.616
Get him off me!
Let go of her!

34:12.699 --> 34:13.900
Hey, lay off!

34:13.952 --> 34:16.203
She's in there, and she wanted
to tell me something.

34:16.270 --> 34:17.536
[Indistinct]

34:17.605 --> 34:19.072
She wanted to
tell me something!

34:19.123 --> 34:21.491
She's in the water!
She's in the--

34:21.576 --> 34:24.460
[all shouting at once]

34:26.080 --> 34:27.614
She wanted to tell me--
[Panting]

34:27.665 --> 34:31.284
Cassie saw her, too!
Cassie saw her, too!

34:31.335 --> 34:33.337
[Sobbing]
Calm down.

34:33.420 --> 34:34.638
I know.
I believe you.

34:34.722 --> 34:36.556
Let's get you
back to the house.

34:36.623 --> 34:37.791
Let's get you
dry.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.176
Diana, take her hand.
Hold onto her.

34:46.967 --> 34:49.436
[No audio]

35:13.995 --> 35:16.546
[Screaming]

35:20.776 --> 35:21.976
Cassie?

35:24.051 --> 35:26.802
It was cut loose.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.867
[Gasps]
That's my grandpa.

35:31.918 --> 35:34.587
[Crying]

35:46.397 --> 35:48.564
[Indistinct chatter
over emergency radio]

35:53.904 --> 35:57.240
[Faye crying]

35:59.893 --> 36:01.133
[Sobs] Mommy.

36:01.134 --> 36:03.585
He's gone.

36:03.636 --> 36:07.756
I'm so sorry, Faye.
[Sighs]

36:14.147 --> 36:15.647
Come here.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.386
You Ok?

36:52.503 --> 36:55.038
I just can't believe
he's dead.

36:55.089 --> 36:57.758
He used Faye's own memories
to reach out to her.

36:57.842 --> 37:00.093
How is that possible?

37:00.178 --> 37:01.561
Sometimes,
when a witch dies,

37:01.646 --> 37:03.180
their energy
hangs around.

37:03.231 --> 37:05.182
It can still be
pretty powerful.

37:05.233 --> 37:08.852
The amazing part is that you
saw what Faye was seeing.

37:08.903 --> 37:10.487
I felt like
we were linked.

37:10.554 --> 37:15.325
The little girl...
or Faye...

37:15.393 --> 37:17.361
called me out
to the dock.

37:17.412 --> 37:20.230
Seeing someone
else's memories?

37:20.281 --> 37:21.731
That's some
big time magic.

37:21.783 --> 37:25.068
When I reached my hand
into the water,

37:25.119 --> 37:28.738
I knew exactly
what to do.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.958
But I have no idea how.

37:32.794 --> 37:35.429
What?

37:35.513 --> 37:37.747
You're looking at me
like I'm a freak.

37:37.799 --> 37:40.717
Not a freak.
Just...

37:40.768 --> 37:43.270
Surprising.

37:44.605 --> 37:47.107
Well, I guess
I can live with that.

38:14.185 --> 38:16.937
Hey, you know, we could drive
to the boathouse.

38:17.005 --> 38:18.939
Make you
some breakfast.

38:19.007 --> 38:20.841
Adam,
what happened last night...

38:20.925 --> 38:23.410
It was pretty good.

38:25.629 --> 38:29.216
It was great.

38:29.283 --> 38:32.853
But it was the last time.

38:32.937 --> 38:36.490
We can't just go back
to the way things were.

38:39.977 --> 38:41.445
Being with you is
all I know,

38:41.496 --> 38:45.032
but I don't know
if it's right anymore.

38:46.868 --> 38:49.819
I do.

38:49.871 --> 38:53.156
I know
for both of us.

38:53.207 --> 38:56.826
Adam, we have to find out
what it feels like

38:56.878 --> 38:59.846
to really be apart.

38:59.964 --> 39:01.998
It's the only way
we'll ever find out

39:02.050 --> 39:04.217
if we're meant
to be together.

39:06.437 --> 39:09.839
I don't want you
to find out...

39:12.260 --> 39:15.695
You're okay without me.

39:37.135 --> 39:38.969
[Sighs]

39:40.138 --> 39:42.038
How was your trip?

39:43.808 --> 39:46.226
Instructive.

39:47.979 --> 39:49.980
Do share.

39:50.047 --> 39:54.768
Cassie's magic is stronger than
anything I've ever experienced.

39:56.487 --> 39:57.737
And?

39:57.822 --> 40:00.023
Someone killed
an elder--

40:00.074 --> 40:02.609
Henry Chamberlain.

40:02.693 --> 40:05.695
But they didn't
do it right.

40:05.746 --> 40:09.166
His energy came back
and led us straight to his body.

40:09.233 --> 40:10.567
Who's responsible?

40:10.618 --> 40:11.868
I don't know.

40:11.936 --> 40:14.538
But there are other forces
in play besides us.

40:14.589 --> 40:16.556
Someone else is
targeting witches.

40:16.624 --> 40:19.376
Then we need
to strike now--

40:19.427 --> 40:24.347
kill Cassie and her circle
and move on.

40:24.415 --> 40:27.134
There's something
about Cassie I'm missing.

40:27.218 --> 40:29.469
The antiquities dealer
left her some kind of warning.

40:29.554 --> 40:31.087
I need to figure out
what it is.

40:31.155 --> 40:34.424
No. It's time for
the witches to die.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.593
And all that's left
for you to do

40:36.644 --> 40:39.596
is to decide whether
you're still one of them.

41:01.636 --> 41:03.587
- Hi.
- Grandma.

41:03.638 --> 41:05.255
Good morning,
sweetheart.

41:05.306 --> 41:07.090
Oh, how are you?

41:07.141 --> 41:11.061
Something terrible
has happened.

41:11.128 --> 41:13.430
It's Henry.

41:13.481 --> 41:15.298
He's dead.

41:15.349 --> 41:17.067
Oh, my God.

41:17.134 --> 41:18.852
He was killed.

41:18.936 --> 41:21.771
I was just there.

41:21.822 --> 41:24.524
I assumed when he didn't answer,
he was away.

41:24.609 --> 41:27.977
You didn't see him?

41:28.029 --> 41:30.447
I never even
made it inside.

41:30.514 --> 41:35.485
But I found your scarf
inside his house.

41:35.536 --> 41:36.953
