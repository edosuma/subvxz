Roller blades?

this song from me?

Wait, what are we talking about?

I'm trying to remember the song
I wrote in my dream last night

you do all the exact same stuff

03:33.505 --> 03:35.547
-You did yesterday before bed?
-Interesting.

I don't ever want
to smell again.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.093
Maybe don't redo that.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.345

03:41.472 --> 03:43.055

I was wearing flip flops,

03:43.140 --> 03:44.765
And I never wear flip flops.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.516
Wow. You are wild

03:55.861 --> 03:59.112
Gene, explain to me again why
you wanted last night's lasagna.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.822
I told you, I need to recreate

04:00.866 --> 04:02.407
Exactly what I did last night

04:02.493 --> 04:03.742
So I can have
the same exact dream

04:03.827 --> 04:05.661
And remember
the amazing song I wrote.

04:05.821 --> 04:07.287
Is that--
does that work?

04:07.373 --> 04:08.830
Well, that's what rudy said.

Finished. Now, I'm gonna change

Into last night's pajamas--

04:15.798 --> 04:17.047

04:17.132 --> 04:19.258
And brush my teeth
with tina's toothbrush

04:32.398 --> 04:34.106
I guess I'm glad
my ears are old.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.732
Ugh. I would pay
a million dollars

04:35.818 --> 04:37.234
For someone to find that cricket
and get it out of here.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.945
Really? Tina and I could find
that cricket for you.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.029
-We could?
-Yeah.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.406
-But not kill it, right?
-No, no.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.616
We'll trap it, give it
a new name, new identity,

04:44.660 --> 04:45.951
A fresh start somewhere else.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.203
So, is a million, like,

And we negotiate from there?

If this is for real,
I'll give you a dollar.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.041
-Twenty dollars.
-Ten, because I'm desperate.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.918
And you'll split it.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.182
Why are you looking for that?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.641
Because I wrote
the perfect song in my dream

05:51.727 --> 05:53.101
And I can't remember any of it.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.770
Well, we don't have anything
like that, sir.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.688
[whispers]
meet me in periodicals.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.565
-Lucid dreaming.
-What?

05:58.650 --> 06:01.526
Lucid dreaming is having
control over your dreams

06:01.612 --> 06:03.111
-And what happens in them.
-You can do that?

06:03.197 --> 06:05.405
[whispers] follow me
to the reference section.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.657
-Yes, I can do that.
-What do you lucid dream about?

06:07.785 --> 06:09.951
I do revenge stuff
on people who were mean to me

06:10.037 --> 06:12.287
In high school, some fantasy
and science fiction,

06:12.373 --> 06:14.122
Some adult stuff
I can't tell you about.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.292
It's hard to have the exact same
dream twice, but it's doable.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.336
So I could learn
how to lucid dream, too?

06:19.380 --> 06:20.420
You could.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.214
[whispers]
come with me to the classics.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.840
Why do we have to have
this meeting

06:23.926 --> 06:25.384
In so many different spots?

06:25.511 --> 06:26.843
Are we trying
to shake a tail or something?

06:26.929 --> 06:28.470
No, I just have to re-shelve
all these books.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.931
Oh. So, is there a book
about lucid dreaming?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.141
No, because we don't
have any good books.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.476
-Internet?
-Internet.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.103
-Can I use a computer?
-The computers here?

06:36.230 --> 06:38.605
Sure, if you want to get
hand, foot, and mouth disease.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.358
Worth it. I'm gonna lucid dream
my way to a grammy.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.818
Or at least to the top
of the pops.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.737
-Thank you, mr. Ambrose.
-Shh! [whispers] we never spoke.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.159
Why is this stuff
all over the hallway?

06:51.203 --> 06:53.537
Is this a new, terrible way
of recycling?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.789
These are cricket traps, dad.
Really good ones.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.041
Yeah, breadcrumbs and sugar
covered with newspaper.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.502
It said online that crickets
are attracted to the food

07:00.629 --> 07:02.129
But then they can't get out
from under the newspaper.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.047
And also they have something
to read while they wait for us

07:04.133 --> 07:05.424
To take them outside.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.259
Or, if the cricket
prefers a nice bottle,

07:07.428 --> 07:10.011
It can try to get this food in
here and then it gets trapped.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.347
But why are there so many traps?
It's just one cricket.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.640
Whatever it takes, bob.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.350
This cricket's a psychopath
and I want him out.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.144
Yeah, dad,
we put traps everywhere--

07:17.312 --> 07:19.229
The hallway, kitchen,
bedrooms, bathrooms--

07:19.314 --> 07:22.107
This cricket's messed with the
wrong frickin' cricket hunters!

07:22.192 --> 07:23.525
-Hell yeah.
-Okay.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.152
We're pretty amped,
we drank a lot of soda

07:25.279 --> 07:26.278
So we could use
the bottles for traps.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.530
Um, so there's bread and sugar

07:28.657 --> 07:30.323
On the floor under
these pieces of newspaper?

07:30.409 --> 07:33.618
-Yup.
-So, we're getting rid
of the cricket but gaining

07:33.745 --> 07:34.995
A ton of ants?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.621
Ants don't make noise.
I'm fine with ants.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.249
Okay, ready for bed,
and I'm off to lucid dream

07:39.376 --> 07:41.209
My way to songwriting success.

-Yeah.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.880
-Really?
-Y-yes.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.215
And it's factual.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.342
Saturday does come
before Sunday.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.718
-Yes, it does.
-Mm-hmm. Mm.
-Yup, yup.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.845
Oh, my god, my song stinks.

16:12.973 --> 16:13.888
No...

16:13.974 --> 16:15.139
My dream lied to me!

16:15.225 --> 16:17.058
This song isn't good at all.
Ugh!

16:17.218 --> 16:19.560
My subconscious
is a total b-hole!

16:24.109 --> 16:27.610
[groans] my so-called
perfect song is awful.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.154
It's not bad. That much.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.490
Yeah, I mean, it had a beat.
I think.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.118
It just has not-great lyrics
and a not-great melody,

16:35.245 --> 16:36.953
But aside from that,
it was pretty good.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.830
Ugh. I'm just gonna
e-mail the contest

16:38.915 --> 16:41.290
And tell them I'm withdrawing
because the song I wrote

16:41.376 --> 16:43.835
That I thought was amazing
is actually terrible.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.628
Do you need to e-mail them?

16:45.714 --> 16:48.172
I think they'll want to know
what's going on with me.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.591
Gene, you kind of wrote
that song in your sleep.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.093
Yes. Your point?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.178
Well, a lot of times,
if something comes too easily,

16:54.264 --> 16:57.015
It's usually not as good
as you think it might be.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.725
-[groans]
-[bob] uh, I'm just saying,

16:58.893 --> 17:00.101
In my experience,

17:00.228 --> 17:02.603
To make something great,
you have to work at it.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.606
How do you know? Oh, right,
the burger thing you do.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.984
Yeah. I mean, you know,
on a good day.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.402
[sighs]
I think

17:09.529 --> 17:12.613
I'm just gonna go to my room
and moan in private.

17:12.741 --> 17:13.948
-Aw.
-[moans]

17:14.034 --> 17:15.733
-Do you want your keyboard?
-[grunts] okay.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.203
-At least you aren't covered
in sparkles and lies.
-Aw.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.414
-So, little cricket update.
-You mean the cricket

17:21.499 --> 17:23.499
That the exterminator's
coming tomorrow to get rid of?

17:23.626 --> 17:26.169
No, the cricket that we're
closing in on and we guarantee

17:26.296 --> 17:28.046
Will be trapped tonight
because we have this.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.381
The most beautiful cricket
anyone's ever seen.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.301
Mr. Chirpy sees her, falls
in love, jumps in the bottle.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.678
Kisses it and probably assumes
it's gonna come to life.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.514
Or, if she's not his type, she
also makes a great best friend.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.976
-She's a good listener.
-This plan can't possibly work.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.478
You would say that
if you weren't

17:43.521 --> 17:45.480
As desperate as we are.
And maybe nobody's

17:45.565 --> 17:48.232
-Been stupid enough to try this.
-Until us.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.359
Good luck. She's pretty
but she also looks dumb.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.488
Why, 'cause her eyes are
crossed? That was an accident.

Eh, in a way.

We caught him
in a different trap,

But we'd like to think that
she gave him a little fomo.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.382

now and, I don't know,

Here you go, five dollars each.

out of here already.

They make you sign away
