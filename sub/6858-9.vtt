00:17.642 --> 00:18.851
ANNOUNCER: A great escape!

00:19.144 --> 00:22.146
Cad Bane and his notorious crew
of bounty hunters

00:22.355 --> 00:24.940
liberated Ziro the Hutt
from a Republic prison

00:25.025 --> 00:27.443
after holding the Galactic Senate hostage.

00:27.944 --> 00:32.448
The Jedi Council has assigned
Obi-Wan Kenobi to retrieve Ziro the Hutt

00:32.532 --> 00:34.950
with the help of Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos.

00:35.035 --> 00:39.621
Unknown to the Jedi, we find Ziro
in the clutches of the five Hutt families

00:39.706 --> 00:42.291
on the distant world of Nal Hutta.

00:43.835 --> 00:48.130
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I see no need for resentment

00:48.214 --> 00:52.217
in light of this joyous occasion
of my freedom.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.261
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

00:58.308 --> 01:03.020
Of course I do appreciate
the help in my escape.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.813
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

01:08.068 --> 01:11.820
I have no illusions
about the fact that my escape

01:11.905 --> 01:16.200
was a result of the highly sensitive
knowledge that I possess.

01:17.202 --> 01:22.206
A holo-diary cataloguing
the nefarious deeds of this council.

(GROANING)

01:24.417 --> 01:26.126

01:29.547 --> 01:33.217
Kill me and the diary will show up
on the step of the Senate.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.636
The cold, hard reality is

01:35.804 --> 01:40.015
that as long as I control
this highly sensitive material,

01:40.058 --> 01:42.684
my memory will only get duller.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.020
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

01:47.565 --> 01:49.525
Yes, take me to my room!

01:49.651 --> 01:53.237
I only hope
the accommodations are satisfactory.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.280
Ah...

02:02.413 --> 02:04.373
Sir, you seem troubled.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.834
Quinlan Vos has that effect.

02:07.043 --> 02:10.754
Ah... Yes, that Jedi has quite a reputation.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.883
That may be overstating it, Cody.
Let's just say he's crazy.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.902
Hey, Commander, looking good.

02:34.362 --> 02:38.407
Kenobi, you look worse for wear.
How's Temple life?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.451
Good seeing you, too.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.913
Yes, well, if you could tell time
half as well as you can stick a landing,

02:45.039 --> 02:46.748
we wouldn't be behind schedule now,
would we?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.543
Well, that's your opinion, man.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.753
Let's get down to business.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.673
Ziro the Hutt was broken out
during a hostage takeover.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.009
Yeah, I read the briefing about that mess.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.261
I suspect Jabba the Hutt is behind this.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.222
He still has it out for Ziro
over the kidnapping of his son.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.018
Well, my information indicates that
Ziro has damaging evidence

03:06.102 --> 03:07.436
against the Hutt Council.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.857
My guess is they've taken him
to the Hutt home planet, Nal Hutta.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.777
As for this bounty hunter, Cad Bane,
we must capture and return both

03:15.862 --> 03:18.030
he and his quarry, Ziro, to the courts.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.200
I trust you and I can keep eyes forward
in this common goal?

03:21.451 --> 03:26.079
No problem. I owe Bane one anyway.
I'll fly, you're my co-pilot.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.124
I was afraid he'd say that.

All in a night's work, baby.

05:06.097 --> 05:09.224
Course, having Ziro locked up
in the detention cell block

05:09.392 --> 05:11.435
probably isn't hurting their mood.

05:11.853 --> 05:17.024
Ziro's here?
If you'll excuse me, I need to step outside.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.279
Gardulla has a request.

Ziro, honey, my true love,
what happened to you?

05:45.345 --> 05:49.139
I thought you were coming back for me.
I waited so long.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.933
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

05:52.226 --> 05:59.232
Our separation last time was a bit abrupt,
and I do blame Jabba for that.

05:59.817 --> 06:00.859
Jabba?

06:01.402 --> 06:04.446
He forced me to have you sent away
from Coruscant,

06:04.864 --> 06:09.826
shattering the serenity
of the happiest time of my life.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.578
Ziro, honey,

06:11.829 --> 06:14.998
being with you
was the happiest time of my life, too.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.459
And now, hearing you say that

06:17.543 --> 06:22.381
makes me the luckiest little Pa'lowick
the galaxy has ever known.

06:23.758 --> 06:27.511
Unfortunately, the cage
that entraps me now

06:27.637 --> 06:31.890
also entraps the chance
of loving you again.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.811
What do they want with you?
Why would they do this?

06:36.229 --> 06:40.732
As hard as it is
to confess this to you, Snooty,

06:41.567 --> 06:43.193
I'm not a perfect Hutt.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.530
I don't care what you've done
or why they want to hurt you.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.992
I only care about us being together,
forever.

there's no way for us to be together

so interested in my tracking abilities,

they went this way.

I guarantee Gardulla
is searching for us as we speak,

she would never, ever show up.
