WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.873
[indistinct conversations]

00:03.960 --> 00:06.745
[police radio chatter]

00:08.965 --> 00:11.011
Hey. Where's Lisbon?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.882
She's in court.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.623
You know you're late.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.842
Yeah, I must have turned
my alarm clock off.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.106
- Overslept.
- Hmm. Hot date?

00:21.412 --> 00:22.892
[chuckles nervously]

00:22.979 --> 00:24.937
What are you talking about?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.157
Well, you know.
Duncan. From L.A.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.072
[Van Pelt laughs]

00:29.159 --> 00:30.465
Wayne, it's not like that.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.423
Oh, right. Sure.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.643
You mind finishing up
these interviews?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.601
[radio chatter continues]

00:36.688 --> 00:38.081
Hi.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.308
Van Pelt's here now.
Is Jane coming?

00:47.395 --> 00:49.527
I don't know. Call him.

00:53.488 --> 00:56.404
[phone rings]

00:56.491 --> 00:59.363
[ringing continues]

01:00.930 --> 01:02.801
Hey, Rigsby.
What's going on?

01:02.888 --> 01:04.847
Uh, you know we have
a case, right?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.675
Yeah. I heard.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.634
I'm, uh, kind of busy here,
so I'm not gonna make it.

01:09.721 --> 01:10.766
[lowered voice]
He's not gonna make it.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.899
Yeah, but I'm happy to help.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.988
Help how?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.599
Well, you two talk to me,
and I'll listen.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.254
You'll be my eyes
and my ears.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.994
Okay, I'll put you
on speaker.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.474
Cho.

01:23.561 --> 01:24.997
Tell Jane what we got.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.391
Housewife.
Missy Roberts. 32.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.393
Maid found her
shot in the bathroom.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.003
[breathes sharply]

01:31.091 --> 01:32.788
There's bullet holes
in the hallway

01:32.875 --> 01:34.790
'and one
in the closet door here.'

01:34.877 --> 01:36.574
'So it looks like a fight
started elsewhere'

01:36.661 --> 01:38.141
'then she ran to the bathroom.'

01:38.228 --> 01:39.708
'Forensics recovered
nine millimeter casings.'

01:39.795 --> 01:41.666
Eh, forensics.
Tell me about the body.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.321
Well, she's lying here

01:44.408 --> 01:46.454
on the floor
in gym clothes.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.848
She's been shot in the chest,
uh, once in the foot

01:49.935 --> 01:52.460
and there's two bullet holes
lodged in the ground

01:52.547 --> 01:54.505
so we're not dealing
with an expert marksman.

01:54.592 --> 01:57.421
Well, maybe, maybe not.
Uh, what about the husband?

01:57.508 --> 01:59.597
[Cho]
Yeah. Husband.

01:59.684 --> 02:03.340
Name's Kip. He runs a high-end
home electronics company.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.560
'He left town two days ago
on some boondoggle'

02:05.647 --> 02:07.214
'white-water rafting
trip to Tahoe.'

02:07.301 --> 02:08.824
Interesting.
How did he take the news?

02:08.911 --> 02:10.347
'Well, he hasn't
gotten it yet.'

02:10.434 --> 02:11.740
His office says
the rafting group will be

02:11.827 --> 02:13.263
out of cell range
for another day or so.

02:13.350 --> 02:16.005
Hmm. Describe to me
the bedroom.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.007
Why?

02:18.094 --> 02:19.835
Well, I want to understand
their relationship.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.358
A bedroom says a lot.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.186
Okay.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.582
Alright, it's, uh..

02:27.669 --> 02:29.801
..cold, impersonal.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.499
Tightly made bed.

02:31.586 --> 02:34.589
- No pictures.
- Mm. Let's try the kitchen.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.156
Okay.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.987
Okay. What am I looking for?

02:42.074 --> 02:43.728
Tell me what's in the fridge.

02:45.469 --> 02:48.690
Butter, milk, eggs..

02:48.777 --> 02:50.518
...baking stuff.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.954
[sighs]

02:52.041 --> 02:53.782
Which makes sense,
because there are these

02:53.869 --> 02:56.088
awesome looking cupcakes
on the counter.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.309
They're, uh, red velvet,
I think.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.050
Yeah. Wh-what else
is in the fridge?

03:01.137 --> 03:02.399
Uh..

03:02.486 --> 03:04.271
...a bunch of diet shakes
and soda.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.795
Hmm. Is the victim heavy?

03:06.882 --> 03:08.623
Oh, no, she's very thin.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.451
What about Kip?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.279
'Um, I guess
he's kind of chubby.'

03:12.366 --> 03:15.107
'But it looks like he sees
a personal trainer, though.'

03:15.195 --> 03:17.588
Oh, this is not
a happy marriage.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.634
Kip's portly but fights it.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.071
Missy is naturally thin
and a gourmet baker.

03:22.158 --> 03:25.292
He views her hobby
as a sabotage and resents it.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.382
'She views his dieting
as a lack of interest'

03:28.469 --> 03:30.035
'in her personal outlet.'

03:30.122 --> 03:32.212
You need to talk to Kip.

03:32.299 --> 03:35.127
He wants us to talk to Kip.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.695
We can't,
not until tomorrow.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.002
'Oh, please, this is
the last guy who'd go'

03:40.089 --> 03:41.308
'on a white-water rafting trip.'

03:41.395 --> 03:42.613
You don't hire
a personal trainer

03:42.700 --> 03:44.441
'cause you like
strenuous activity.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.617
You hire a personal trainer
because it's the only possible

03:46.704 --> 03:48.315
way to get yourself to do it.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.794
So you think he lied
about the trip?

03:49.881 --> 03:51.622
Well, I'm almost certain.

03:51.709 --> 03:54.103
So if he's not white-water
rafting, where is he?

03:54.190 --> 03:55.974
Well, I don't know, but I'm sure
you two will figure it out.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.846
And, Rigsby...

03:57.933 --> 03:59.978
...put the cupcake back.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.642
[theme music]

04:21.783 --> 04:24.176
[Patrick]
Lisbon, I can hear you
skulking around out there.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.396
- What is it?
- We've got a case.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.311
You can deal
with Red John later.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.271
Yeah, Missy Roberts.
I already broke that wide open.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.056
Yeah, I heard. The old
rafting trip gambit?

04:34.143 --> 04:36.188
Yep, exactly.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.061
Except for Kip Roberts
texted a picture of himself

04:39.148 --> 04:41.106
to Missy right before she died.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.239
He's holding a paddle
next to a river

04:43.326 --> 04:44.980
with a raft full of bozos.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.374
Eh. Trick photography.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.506
The Tahoe cops are gonna
go pick him up

04:49.593 --> 04:52.074
but in the meantime, let's go
talk to the victim's sister.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.559
Jane, I need you.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.229
It's nice to be needed.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.277
Anything for you, Lisbon.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.631
We're very sorry
for your loss, Emma.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.546
Were you
and your sister close?

05:29.633 --> 05:31.287
Missy was like
a second mother to me

05:31.374 --> 05:34.246
but, you know,
now we're just..

05:34.334 --> 05:35.900
...in different places
in our lives

05:35.987 --> 05:38.250
but I just hadn't seen her
in a while.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.905
Did she say if she was having
any problems recently?

05:40.992 --> 05:44.213
I knew that she was tired
of...staying at home

05:44.300 --> 05:46.607
you know, and-and, like,
not feeling useful

05:46.694 --> 05:49.523
and I think that that was why
she started volunteering..

05:49.610 --> 05:51.438
...at the bakery.

05:51.525 --> 05:55.267
- Where?
- Um, the O.G. Bakery.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.182
It's this nonprofit
where they..

05:57.269 --> 05:59.271
...they teach ex-cons
new skills, you know

05:59.359 --> 06:01.578
like baking and..

06:01.665 --> 06:04.451
She started there
a few months ago.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.889
Was anybody giving her
trouble there?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.717
Not that I know of.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.719
Were Missy and Kip, uh..

06:11.806 --> 06:14.286
...trying anything
to save their marriage?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.289
Um, about a month ago, they..

06:17.377 --> 06:19.857
...went on this radio show with
with this love doctor guy

06:19.944 --> 06:21.511
and, um...

06:21.598 --> 06:23.426
I think they were seeing him
privately also.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.689
A love doctor, huh?

06:25.776 --> 06:29.214
Some...Buddy...something,
I don't know.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.129
Um, Henner or..

06:31.216 --> 06:32.827
Buddy Hennings?

06:32.914 --> 06:34.785
He has a talk radio show

06:34.872 --> 06:38.485
"prescription for love
with Buddy Hennings."

06:38.572 --> 06:41.879
What? I've listened to it
in my car a few times.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.795
Alright. I'll go talk
to Buddy Hennings

06:44.882 --> 06:48.016
the love doctor, and you
check out the shady bakery.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.452
Van Pelt and Rigsby
can handle that.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.193
I'll go to the radio station
with you.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.500
Ahh, that's 'cause
you're afan.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.892
I am not!

06:54.979 --> 06:57.112
Look, I just think
he's a viable lead.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.375
It's alright, Lisbon. We all
have our guilty pleasures.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.429
Oh, this must be
very exciting for you.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.082
That's enough.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.825
Hey, Van Pelt.
What'd you find out?

07:14.912 --> 07:16.610
Turns out one of the ex-cons
at the bakery

07:16.697 --> 07:19.961
was still selling drugs. A girl
named Monica Suarez, 20.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.659
Missy found out and reported her
to the bakery supervisor.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.400
Well, what's Monica's deal?

07:24.487 --> 07:26.141
'She's been in the system
since she was 14.'

07:26.228 --> 07:28.883
Vandalism, assault, dealing.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.450
She just got out of
Chowchilla six months ago.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.060
Ah. Real sweetheart.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.062
'Yeah, that's what the bakery
supervisor said.'

07:34.149 --> 07:37.500
After Missy reported Monica,
Missy's tires were slashed.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.807
She said she saw Monica
following her a few times.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.548
Alright, you and Riggs
go and pick her up.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.550
Alright.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.551
Alright.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.908
Hi. We need to speak
with Buddy Hennings.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.649
If you want to be on the show

07:55.736 --> 07:59.217
you have to fill out this form
and take it to couples-intake.

07:59.304 --> 08:02.003
Oh, we're not
a couple. Please.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.962
What she means is ours is
more of a platonic love.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.921
[rustling]

08:07.008 --> 08:08.444
[Lisbon breathes sharply]

08:08.531 --> 08:10.490
Buddy Hennings, please.

08:10.577 --> 08:11.926
He's on the air.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.015
Talk to his producer.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.930
She's a huge fan.
She's a little..

08:16.017 --> 08:17.714
Very excited. Yeah.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.196
Sean, what I'm hearing
from you

08:21.283 --> 08:23.633
is that Lisa has become
sexually cold

08:23.720 --> 08:25.679
ever since the baby
was born.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.377
Oh, excuse me. This-this isn't
a good time. Can I help you?

08:28.464 --> 08:30.422
I'm Agent Lisbon
with the CBI.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.381
- This is Patrick Jane.
- Hi.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.602
We're investigating the murder
of Missy Roberts.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.256
I'm-I'm sorry to hear about
that, but we're live here.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.563
[lowered voice]
come in, please.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.130
You have to excuse
our producer Gary.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.740
He's a bit of
a control freak.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.090
Thinks everyone's out
to ruinhisshow.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.352
Well, just 'cause
he's paranoid

08:47.439 --> 08:48.832
doesn't mean they're not
out to get him.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.791
- Who are you?
- I'm Elizabeth Hennings.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.793
- Hi.
- I'm Buddy's wife and manager.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.578
Uh, we heard about Missy.
It's just awful.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.667
We need to talk to Buddy.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.321
Okay, well, it's gonna be
a little while, alright?

08:59.408 --> 09:00.975
'Cause we're in the middle
of a segment

09:01.062 --> 09:02.672
then we have to shoot
a promo for a webcast, so..

09:02.759 --> 09:04.413
That's alright.
We like to watch.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.545
Don't we?

09:09.070 --> 09:10.550
- Look at this. Look at this.
- Please don't touch anything.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.116
No, I won't.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.820
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.823
Monica's parole officer said
it's the right address.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.303
So we keep waiting.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.697
Yep.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.307
[speaking indistinctly]

09:30.395 --> 09:32.093
Stakeouts are the worst.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.793
Wayne, is something wrong?

09:39.970 --> 09:42.146
No. There's nothing wrong.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.716
I've been feeling kinda weird
since you've been back.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.892
Yeah, you've been acting
kind of weird.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.373
- What's up with that?
- It's just..

09:51.460 --> 09:54.071
...when you were in L.A.,
I had time to think..

09:54.158 --> 09:56.552
about you. About us.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.859
Hmm. Okay.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.469
And?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.602
Well, I mean, did you think
about me at all?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.081
Of course I did.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.434
[women speaking indistinctly]

10:11.872 --> 10:13.830
Wait, is that her
on the left?

10:18.269 --> 10:19.836
Uh, yeah. Come on.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.535
Monica Suarez?

10:24.754 --> 10:25.886
Hey!

10:28.715 --> 10:30.499
CBI!

10:30.586 --> 10:32.327
Get out of the way!
Police!

10:32.414 --> 10:33.633
[tires screech]

10:39.203 --> 10:40.683
Police!

10:47.037 --> 10:48.517
[thud]

10:51.912 --> 10:54.566
Get your hands off me!
I got nothing on me!

10:54.654 --> 10:57.613
Yeah, 'cause you threw
your stash in the dumpster.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.136
[panting]

10:59.223 --> 11:01.095
- You good?
- Yeah, you?

11:01.182 --> 11:03.967
Yeah.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.490
Talk to me
about Missy Roberts.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.318
Who?

11:07.405 --> 11:08.972
She was murdered
last night.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.279
[scoffs]
First I heard of it.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.498
But you messed with her
when she got you fired, right?

11:13.585 --> 11:16.632
I was still on parole.
I-I needed that job.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.590
So you slashed her tires,
stalked her?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.158
I-I just followed her around,
you know, to freak her out.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.291
Oh, yeah? You see
anything interesting?

11:23.378 --> 11:26.381
Not really. I mean, you know,
she went shoe shopping

11:26.468 --> 11:29.123
and got mani-pedis a lot.
You know, rich lady stuff.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.168
Where were you last night?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.737
I was at my cousin's
quinceanera.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.785
All night.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.787
Alright. Come on.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.180
Let's go!

11:43.267 --> 11:46.270
[Buddy]
This is Buddy Hennings with
"Prescription for love."

11:46.357 --> 11:49.317
we'll be back in ten minutes,
right after the news.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.764
Buddy, these people
are from CBI.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.984
'They're, uh, here about Missy.'

12:04.071 --> 12:06.551
Buddy Hennings. Glad to help
any way I can.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.163
Buddy, we have a phone call
with the publisher

12:09.250 --> 12:11.731
in about a half hour.
So, if you all don't need me..

12:11.818 --> 12:12.949
Oh, by all means.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.911
I know you're a busy man.
We just have a few questions.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.870
Missy and Kip, they were
on your show a while back?

12:20.957 --> 12:23.612
Yes. Good people,
both of them.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.266
Some of the couples
we get in here

12:25.353 --> 12:27.529
they're really just here
for their 15 minutes

12:27.616 --> 12:30.010
but I had a feeling
that Missy really wanted

12:30.097 --> 12:31.881
to work on her marriage.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.796
That's why I offered
to see them privately.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.972
And when was the last time
you saw them?

12:36.059 --> 12:38.670
Last week. Thursday.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.977
Supposed to come in this week,
but she called to cancel.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.631
She didn't give a reason.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.546
[ringing continues]

12:44.633 --> 12:46.156
You know what?
I have to take this.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.419
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.900
Well, listen, Buddy,
while we're just chatting

12:50.987 --> 12:53.250
just you and I here,
hanging out, a couple of guys

12:53.337 --> 12:55.035
do you think Kip
could have done it?

12:55.122 --> 12:57.341
No. Absolutely not.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.082
But you said it was Missy
that wanted help

12:59.169 --> 13:00.518
with their marriage, not Kip.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.085
Well, I think
in the beginning

13:02.172 --> 13:03.826
he was going along
to get along

13:03.913 --> 13:05.915
but he turned a corner.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.699
How so?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.311
Well, in the first few
sessions he was very distant

13:10.398 --> 13:12.617
very uncooperative,
both with me and with Missy.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.010
Mm-hmm.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.795
But then, after
a couple of sessions

13:15.882 --> 13:18.536
he developed an attentiveness
and a warmth

13:18.623 --> 13:20.190
that I hadn't seen in him
before.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.323
- He really changed.
- Maybe.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.846
You don't agree?

13:23.933 --> 13:26.022
Well, you know, maybe
he was just covering.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.503
He felt guilty for something,
like having an affair.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.940
Oh..
[scoffs]

13:31.027 --> 13:32.768
I saw no signs
of an affair.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.858
Oh, come on. The recent
drive to get in shape

13:35.945 --> 13:39.122
suddenly doting on his wife that
he'd been neglecting for years.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.081
Well, I would like to think
that he was responding

13:41.168 --> 13:42.473
to the treatment.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.301
Ah. Bon point.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.652
Hi. Um..

13:47.739 --> 13:49.829
would you mind giving us
a minute alone?

13:49.916 --> 13:51.831
- I'm sorry.
- Sure thing.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.444
The cops finally tracked down
the rafting group.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.794
It turns out Kip skipped out
after the first night.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.709
Hmm. I hate to say
I told you so.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.450
And we still don't know
where he is.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.017
His last credit card charge
was yesterday

14:04.104 --> 14:05.888
at a gas station
outside of Tahoe.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.412
The attendant remembers him
being with a blonde woman.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.197
- Plot thickens.
- Hmm.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.416
Or should I say thins?

14:12.503 --> 14:14.766
Let's go back to the CBI.
I'm gonna put out a BOLO.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.769
BOLO shmolo. We need to
reach a wider audience.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.684
And how do you propose
we do that?

14:19.771 --> 14:22.165
Welcome back to KZHC

14:22.252 --> 14:25.952
where we play the smooth sounds
of the '80s and the '90s.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.736
I'm Patrick Jane

14:27.823 --> 14:29.869
from the California bureau
of investigation.

14:29.956 --> 14:33.046
Yes, that is something
that does exist.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.699
And we're throwing
a contest today

14:34.786 --> 14:36.397
because we need your help

14:36.484 --> 14:38.442
to find a car,
a very important car

14:38.529 --> 14:41.532
that will help us break
a very important case.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.753
We're looking for a silver
Mercedes S-class

14:44.840 --> 14:47.843
license plate "Kipman7"

14:47.930 --> 14:51.020
K-I-P-M-A-N-7.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.980
The first person to call in
the location of this car

14:54.067 --> 14:57.157
will receive $10,000
cash money.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.941
Yes, folks, we're
talking ca..

14:59.028 --> 15:01.422
Whoop. Wait.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.815
I just got word
from my producer

15:03.903 --> 15:07.297
that that is not the amount
of the prize.

15:07.384 --> 15:10.300
It is actually..

15:10.387 --> 15:11.954
...twenty dollars..

15:12.041 --> 15:13.564
...and the chance to guest
deejay

15:13.651 --> 15:15.001
here at the radio station...

15:15.088 --> 15:17.046
Day and date of your Choosing.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.613
That's right, folks.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.876
Guest deejay spot
during drive time

15:20.963 --> 15:23.052
and in case you missed it,
I'll put all the details up

15:23.139 --> 15:24.749
on the CBI web site.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.403
[whispers]
Do we have a CBI web site?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.840
Yes, that nice..

15:28.928 --> 15:30.538
...CBI web site.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.062
Excellent. Now let's see
those phone lines light up.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.543
Talk to me, please.
Talk to me, people.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.501
Come on, Sacramento.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.423
[Lisbon]
'Uh, when did they check in?'

15:46.510 --> 15:48.382
Yesterday. Room 311,

15:48.469 --> 15:49.992
Under her name
Rosie Dunlop.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.038
Was she fit? Muscular?

15:52.125 --> 15:53.387
Yeah.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.258
- Personal trainer.
- Oh.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.959
[muffled shouting]

16:02.048 --> 16:03.136
Okay.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.615
Gonna be like that.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.923
Mr. Roberts, this is CBI!
Open the door!

16:09.838 --> 16:11.361
[muffled shouting continues]

16:11.448 --> 16:13.102
Mr. Roberts, we're coming in!

16:14.756 --> 16:16.236
[key clicking]

16:25.506 --> 16:26.855
Jane?

16:26.942 --> 16:29.249
[muffled]
Please. Don't shoot. Please.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.996
[speaks indistinctly]

16:37.083 --> 16:38.171
- Please..

16:38.258 --> 16:40.260
- Kip Roberts?
- Uh-huh.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.479
I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.916
Jungle theme.
It's classy.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.528
[female #1]
'Who are you?'

16:47.615 --> 16:49.182
What's going on?

16:49.269 --> 16:51.010
Mr. Roberts, are you being
held against your will?

16:51.097 --> 16:53.664
No, not at all.
No, we're consenting adults.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.493
You gotta believe me.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.929
Oh, I believe you.

16:59.931 --> 17:03.065
Missy was...kind..

17:03.152 --> 17:05.154
...selfless.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.504
But she wanted kids.

17:07.591 --> 17:11.508
And after a bunch
of miscarriages, we..

17:11.595 --> 17:13.075
...drifted apart.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.992
It's my fault. I know.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.038
Probably.
You cheated on her.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.216
I never meant to hurt Missy.

17:23.303 --> 17:26.306
A-and-and Rosie's
the only one, I swear.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.786
I'm not-I'm not one of
those guys, you know?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.571
How long was the affair
going on?

17:30.658 --> 17:32.094
A few months.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.142
I mean, I tried
to stop, but..

17:36.229 --> 17:39.449
'...I struggle with willpower.'

17:39.536 --> 17:41.277
'And..'

17:41.364 --> 17:46.108
...there were certain...things
about Rosie that I liked.

17:46.195 --> 17:49.633
Things that were
maybe missing from my marriage.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.940
You mean Rosie gets rough
with you. You like that.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.725
Yeah.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.686
You think Missy knew
about the affair?

18:00.644 --> 18:03.604
I don't know. Maybe.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.301
It was weird.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.435
She called me while I was
driving up to Tahoe.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.654
Said she wanted
to make it work.

18:10.741 --> 18:14.267
That she never gave up
on us, that..

18:14.354 --> 18:16.573
...she would always love me.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.662
And that's weird?

18:18.749 --> 18:20.838
It was the most intimate
conversation

18:20.925 --> 18:22.623
we'd had in years.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.713
And I vowed to myself that
I would break things off

18:25.800 --> 18:27.454
with Rosie as soon as I got
to the hotel.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.500
- Did you?
- Yes.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.981
But..

18:33.068 --> 18:36.376
...Rosie is
a very passionate woman.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.293
And when I try to break
things off, she hits me.

18:40.380 --> 18:44.688
And when she hits me,
I get turned on.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.734
The heart wants
what it wants.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.914
Do we have any closer
photos of Missy's closet?

18:53.001 --> 18:54.524
Um...I don't know.

18:54.611 --> 18:58.180
There's a whole other
stack of pictures.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.008
[Cho]
'I just finished with Kip.'

19:00.095 --> 19:02.053
He seemed genuinely upset
about his wife.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.186
Then again,
he was cheating on her.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.840
I talked to Rosie,
the mistress.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.059
She said her and Kip were
drinking at the hotel bar

19:08.147 --> 19:09.148
at the time
of Missy's death.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.845
She has every reason to lie.

19:10.932 --> 19:14.153
Hold on to Kip and her
until their alibis check out.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.980
[Patrick]
'Was Missy's home very neat?'

19:16.067 --> 19:18.331
You know, an "everything
in its place" type of house?

19:18.418 --> 19:19.680
Yeah. Why?

19:21.551 --> 19:22.900
I'm going back
to the radio station.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.511
I need to take a look
at that, uh

19:24.598 --> 19:27.035
webcast thingy
of Missy and Kip.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.776
Why?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.734
I need to see Missy's feet.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.651
[phone rings]

19:34.738 --> 19:36.566
Hello? KZHC.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.265
Let me check. Hold on.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.183
[door knob clicks]

20:38.149 --> 20:39.499
- Hey there.
- Hey!

20:39.586 --> 20:42.545
Oh, God.
You gave me a start.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.330
What are you doing here?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.419
Oh, you know. Investigating.

20:48.421 --> 20:51.162
Well, I'm...sorry I was late.
I had an appointment.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.164
[chuckles]

20:53.252 --> 20:55.341
You found Kip Roberts,
I presume.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.560
Oh, yes, yes.
It worked like a charm.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.519
In fact, it worked so well

20:59.606 --> 21:01.260
I'm gonna ask you
for another favor.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.045
Shoot.

21:04.132 --> 21:07.309
I need to see Missy and Kip's
episode of your show.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.180
Do you have a copy
around here anywhere?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.487
Well, I sure don't.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.533
But I'll bet Gary
could help you.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.361
Great.

21:15.448 --> 21:18.015
I mean, Michael and I
have been together six months

21:18.102 --> 21:20.061
but sometimes I feel like
we're missing

21:20.148 --> 21:21.584
a deeper connection,
you know?

21:21.671 --> 21:23.325
Mm-hmm. Buddy will definitely
get into that

21:23.412 --> 21:24.674
with you
on the show tomorrow.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.894
- You agree with Shayna?
- Hundred percent.

21:26.981 --> 21:30.593
[Patrick]
'Really?'

21:30.680 --> 21:31.986
A hundred?
Not 98 or 99?

21:32.073 --> 21:33.988
The full, even 100%?

21:35.859 --> 21:37.644
Wow, Buddy's not gonna have
much to work with here.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.820
Mr. Jane.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.256
Hi.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.128
- What a pleasure.
- Yeah, always.

21:44.215 --> 21:47.741
I need to see, uh, the webcast
of Missy and Kip's episode.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.612
Could you get that
for me, please?

21:52.963 --> 21:54.617
Sure. But it'll take
a minute.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.924
Good. Time to make
a cup of tea.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.970
So, Missy and Kip.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.320
Why don't you begin
by telling us

22:01.407 --> 22:02.973
a little bit about
your marriage?

22:03.060 --> 22:05.498
Is this the only angle
you've got?

22:05.585 --> 22:07.891
It's a webcast..

22:07.978 --> 22:09.502
...not Steven Spielberg.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.158
Of course.
Thank you.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.986
'Well, I appreciate
your honesty.'

22:16.073 --> 22:17.901
And I know it's scary

22:17.988 --> 22:20.600
but it's like I always say,
if nothing changes..

22:20.687 --> 22:22.253
...nothing changes.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.867
[instrumental music]

22:38.748 --> 22:40.837
Rigsby, it's Jane.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.970
I need you to go back
to Missy Roberts house.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.451
- Okay, for what?
- 'A pair of sexy gold sandals.'

22:45.538 --> 22:46.800
I didn't them
in her shoe rack

22:46.887 --> 22:48.584
'but I need you to look
everywhere.'

22:48.671 --> 22:49.629
Copy that.

22:49.716 --> 22:50.934
Just so that we're clear

22:51.021 --> 22:53.894
how would you define
sexy?

22:53.981 --> 22:55.678
You'll know it when you see it.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.514
Hey, these are gold.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.037
I'm not sure how sexy
they are.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.865
They're not sexy.
And they're beige.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.566
Hey, you know that
Van Pelt's dating someone?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.918
[sighs]
Yeah.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.529
We sort of talked
about us today.

23:20.616 --> 23:23.402
Not really,
but...kind of.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.490
'It was weird.'

23:25.665 --> 23:28.058
What do you think?

23:28.145 --> 23:29.886
I think we need
to call Jane.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.105
They're not here.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.283
Hey, Cho. Any luck?

23:35.370 --> 23:36.676
[sighs]
They're not here.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.852
Well, as expected.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.462
Oh, there is one more thing.

23:40.549 --> 23:43.422
Ask Rigsby what size shoe
Van Pelt is.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.162
[Kimball]
'What size shoe
does Van Pelt wear?'

23:45.249 --> 23:47.034
Uh, I wanna say an eight

23:47.121 --> 23:48.601
a seven and a half
if they run big.

23:48.688 --> 23:49.819
Eight.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.081
Excellent.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.395
The hotel bar
has video surveillance.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.528
Kip and Rosie's alibi
check out.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.791
- So we're back to square one.
- Don't be so sure.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.271
I have a very exciting
assignment for you, Grace.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.317
You do? Cool.
What is it?

24:09.404 --> 24:12.363
These are for you.
Try 'em on.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.844
- Nothing for me?
- Trust me. You won't like 'em.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.193
[paper rustles]

24:16.280 --> 24:18.544
- They're really high.
- Try 'em on.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.371
Go on. Take 'em
for a little spin.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.769
[Patrick]
'That is what
I'm talking about.'

24:26.856 --> 24:28.858
'Right there.'

24:31.644 --> 24:32.688
How do they look?

24:32.775 --> 24:34.647
Mmm. Perfect.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.562
Jane, you want to tell me
what's going on?

24:36.649 --> 24:39.086
Well, let's just say
the game is afoot.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.263
Two feet.

24:48.312 --> 24:50.489
- So, what's your play here?
- Oh, no play.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.403
- I'm gonna help 'em.
- Right.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.540
Michael. Shayna.

25:00.324 --> 25:01.369
Hi.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.718
- Hold on a sec.
- Patrick Jane.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.285
I met you yesterday
in the studio.

25:04.372 --> 25:06.113
Are you guys excited about
being on the show?

25:06.200 --> 25:07.767
- Yes, I can't wait.
- Totally, yeah.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.377
Yeah. Sure.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.118
Shayna, why don't you
go ahead?

25:11.205 --> 25:13.729
There's just one thing I want
to go over with Michael.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.992
Okay. I'll wait
over there.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.169
Hey, are you still there?

25:19.256 --> 25:20.344
Look at that, huh?

25:20.431 --> 25:21.650
Yeah.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.260
Alright, listen, Michael

25:23.347 --> 25:24.610
you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.176
You don't have to go
on the radio.

25:26.263 --> 25:29.615
Yeah. Of course I know that.
I want to go.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.225
Well, you can lie to me.
I don't care.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.009
But don't lie to yourself.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.055
I know you think Shayna's
out of your league

25:35.142 --> 25:36.622
and you don't want
to rock the boat.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.188
That's why you agree
with everything she says.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.103
Okay, that's just,
that's just not true.

25:40.190 --> 25:43.150
Okay? I just think
that she's right...a lot.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.369
When was the last time you were
completely honest with her?

25:45.456 --> 25:47.894
Last time you disagreed with
her on something important?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.026
Um..

25:52.115 --> 25:53.682
Okay.
Alright, alright, fine.

25:53.769 --> 25:56.467
- Maybe, maybe you're right.
- Mm-hmm.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.777
[speaking indistinctly]

26:01.864 --> 26:03.649
I don't want
to lose her.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.781
I get it. I get that.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.087
But you're gonna go in there,
you're gonna tell her.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.002
Hey, babe, I don't
want to go on this show.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.004
I mean, who in their
right mind

26:11.091 --> 26:13.659
wants to air their dirty
laundry on the radio

26:13.746 --> 26:15.312
for other people's
entertainment?

26:15.399 --> 26:17.793
It is a terrible idea.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.796
And she will respect you
for making a stand.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.019
- You really think so?
- Oh, yes.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.674
Women love a strong man.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.806
Besides, have you
listened to the show?

26:30.893 --> 26:32.852
It's crap.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.854
Yeah, yeah, it is.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.595
Right?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.553
- You're right.
- That's right.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.033
- I'm not gonna do it.
- You're not.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.251
- I'm not.
- No.

26:41.338 --> 26:42.513
- That's it.
- That's it, man.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.472
Thank you very much.
Alright.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.128
[instrumental music]

26:58.529 --> 27:00.183
[breathing nervously]

27:00.270 --> 27:02.751
Oh, thank God.
There you are.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.274
What's the matter?

27:04.361 --> 27:07.060
Tonight's couple, Shayna
and Michael, just canceled.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.583
Fifteen minutes out.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.803
Well, there's a young couple
there in intake.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.369
They're nice-looking kids.

27:12.456 --> 27:15.459
Can you prep them
in time for the show?

27:15.546 --> 27:16.765
I'm gonna have to.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.201
Excuse me.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.728
Just move!

27:24.555 --> 27:27.123
Okay. Change of plans, guys.
You're going on in five.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.864
Oh, that's great news,
isn't it, babe?

27:28.951 --> 27:31.084
- Sure, sweetie.
- Okay. Stay there.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.445
4 o'clock. We're up.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.665
[Buddy]
'Howdy, everybody.
This is Buddy Hennings'

27:46.752 --> 27:48.754
'on Prescription For Love'

27:48.841 --> 27:52.714
coming to you live
from KZHChere in Sacramento

27:52.801 --> 27:54.890
and right here
in the studio with us today

27:54.977 --> 27:58.415
we have Dwayne and Stace.
Welcome to you both.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.809
- Hi.
- Uh...hi.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.072
[clears throat]
We're happy to be here.

28:03.159 --> 28:06.423
Long-time listeners,
first-time...guests.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.077
Well, why don't you begin
by telling us

28:08.164 --> 28:10.123
a little bit about
why you're here?

28:10.210 --> 28:12.691
We're having some
communication issues.

28:12.778 --> 28:13.866
What does that mean,
exactly?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.389
Oh, you know,
we're having trouble

28:15.476 --> 28:18.000
like, uh, talking
to each other.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.785
Dwayne, how about you
not pee on my head

28:19.872 --> 28:21.656
and call it rain?

28:22.483 --> 28:24.224
Excuse me?

28:24.311 --> 28:27.488
If you wanna get better, you're
gonna have to get real for me

28:27.575 --> 28:29.229
so why don't you
begin by telling me

28:29.316 --> 28:30.839
something I don't know?

28:34.974 --> 28:38.194
We have kind of
a...rocky history.

28:38.281 --> 28:41.458
'We've been on and off for
about five years, mostly off.'

28:41.545 --> 28:43.547
Yeah, we met on the job.

28:43.634 --> 28:47.334
There was a no fraternization
policy, but we, um..

28:47.421 --> 28:48.596
...fraternized.

28:49.597 --> 28:50.685
A lot.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.774
Well, now we're getting
somewhere.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.125
How's the sex?

28:56.952 --> 28:59.172
Um..
Well..

28:59.259 --> 29:02.262
It's been a while, but when
we have it, it's-it's good.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.352
Yes?

29:05.439 --> 29:07.702
Yes.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.052
We should not be
listening to this. Really.

29:10.139 --> 29:13.969
Oh, come on, Lisbon.
Don't be such a prude.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.711
A little too soon in the game
to be calling a time-out.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.845
There's just a lot of,
uh...baggage

29:19.932 --> 29:21.760
left over
from all the off periods.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.111
Why did you break up?

29:25.198 --> 29:27.156
Well, I think
we broke up the first time

29:27.243 --> 29:29.811
because you decided that
the job was more important.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.682
Right? Wasn't that it?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.815
Yeah, well, then you got
Sarah pregnant.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.991
Yeah, after you got
engaged to a maniac.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.601
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.081
We don't use exaggeration here.

29:39.168 --> 29:42.345
It's no help to us
at all. Maniac, no.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.957
Maybe you didn't approve.
That's fair game.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.697
Let's get back to the baby.
Is that true, Dwayne?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.525
No.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.745
Uh, yes, I had a baby
with someone else

29:50.832 --> 29:53.443
but we were off...totally off.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.925
What about the engagement?

29:57.012 --> 29:58.144
It didn't work out.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.841
Yeah, because he's
a homicidal maniac.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.495
Fine.

30:01.582 --> 30:04.367
[Buddy]
'Relationships can be brutal.'

30:04.454 --> 30:06.369
[Grace]
'And for the record,
I'm not angry about the baby.'

30:06.456 --> 30:08.023
[Wayne]
'Oh, really,
'cause I never thought'

30:08.110 --> 30:09.808
'you were angry, but you sound
kind of angry now.'

30:09.895 --> 30:11.940
[Grace]
'No, I just
thought it was weird'

30:12.027 --> 30:13.768
that you would have a baby
with someone you barely knew.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.204
Well, why don't you tell me
what you really think?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.945
- But--
- But what? What else is there?

30:18.642 --> 30:20.775
But I love that you're a dad.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.520
You do?

30:26.607 --> 30:30.002
When we got together,
we were kids.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.569
I was a young, naive girl.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.310
I wasn't ready
to commit to you.

30:36.747 --> 30:39.446
It wasn't about the job.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.884
At least that wasn't
all of it.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.843
But things
have changed since then.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.367
We're not the same.
And that's okay.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.022
I like who I am now.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.373
I like who you are.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.419
You're a man.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.119
You guys are fantastic.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.730
So real.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.389
Before we go, is there
anything you two

31:09.476 --> 31:11.217
would like to say
to each other?

31:11.304 --> 31:13.262
No.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.916
Yes.
Just..

31:16.004 --> 31:16.962
[breathes deeply]

31:18.441 --> 31:20.661
I'm sorry.

31:20.748 --> 31:23.664
For a lot of things.

31:23.751 --> 31:26.406
I care about you
and I never meant to hurt you.

31:29.539 --> 31:31.280
Alright, your turn.
Anything?

31:33.456 --> 31:35.894
You know how I feel
about you.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.721
It's the same way
I've always felt.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.288
It's never changed.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.029
Since the first day
I met you.

31:45.033 --> 31:48.036
Well, then my work
is done here.

31:48.123 --> 31:51.039
Thank you for listening
to Prescription For Love.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.999
This is Buddy Hennings..

31:54.086 --> 31:57.263
...on KZHC Talk Radio.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.053
Bravo.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.968
That was a fantastic show.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.622
Thanks.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.189
That was really helpful.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.756
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
Thanks, doc.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.584
[cell phone rings]
Excuse me.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.284
Hello?

32:18.371 --> 32:19.676
Great job, Rigsby.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.813
Oh. Hi, boss.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.033
Wow. Tonight? Really?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.991
'Uh...yeah.'

32:30.078 --> 32:31.166
'I'll be right there.'

32:31.253 --> 32:33.081
Okay. Bye.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.564
I'm so sorry, babe.
It's the Carson job.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.219
I have to go into work.
Uh, you okay to take a cab home?

32:40.306 --> 32:42.003
Oh. Sure. Go.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.223
- Um...see you later.
- Yeah.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.833
- Thanks again, doc.
- My pleasure.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.269
And don't you worry
about her.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.141
- We'll take good care of her.
- Thanks.

32:57.888 --> 33:01.588
Stace, you know, you have
a natural presence on radio.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.720
I mean it.
You are a natural.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.592
Are you saying I have
a face for radio?

33:05.679 --> 33:07.202
Oh, no, no, not at all.

33:07.289 --> 33:09.422
You are definitely
drop-dead gorgeous.

33:09.509 --> 33:10.640
Oh.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.294
[chuckles]

33:12.381 --> 33:13.904
You know, I think maybe
you two could benefit

33:13.992 --> 33:15.950
from some private sessions.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.256
Would you be up for that?

33:17.343 --> 33:19.998
Oh. Thank you.
That's so nice of you.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.434
- Oh, my pleasure.
- Hmm.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.349
Just make sure you call
my office.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.093
- Can I call you a cab?
- Oh, no, no, no.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.182
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for everything.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.140
Um, I'll see you soon.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.274
Um, do you mind if I..

33:40.540 --> 33:43.325
[chuckles]
Okay. See you later.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.503
[instrumental music]

33:54.380 --> 33:55.642
[sighs]

33:57.339 --> 33:58.384
[grunts]

33:58.471 --> 33:59.515
[screams]

33:59.602 --> 34:00.560
[thud]

34:04.651 --> 34:06.870
[Grace]
'Oh!'

34:06.957 --> 34:09.177
[Grace groans]

34:09.264 --> 34:10.744
- What happened?
- Ow.

34:10.831 --> 34:13.138
Oh, my heel broke. I think
I twisted my ankle.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.269
[groaning]

34:14.356 --> 34:15.792
That does look bad.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.838
Alright, we'll get you
to my office and we'll

34:17.925 --> 34:20.667
'we'll get some ice on it.
Come on.'

34:20.754 --> 34:22.190
'Come on.'

34:26.760 --> 34:28.457
Hey. How's it going?

34:29.110 --> 34:30.459
Perfect.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.418
The heel thing
worked a treat.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.681
Van Pelt is now alone
with the killer.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.215
There we go.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.568
That should help
with the swelling.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.614
[gasps]
It's cold.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.580
May I?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.104
Sure.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.633
How does that feel?

35:15.591 --> 35:19.726
[Grace]
'It feels
pretty good, actually.'

35:19.813 --> 35:22.511
He's really into feet.
How did you know that?

35:22.598 --> 35:24.165
Eh, it was kind of obvious,
don't you think?

35:24.252 --> 35:26.559
I wouldn't be asking
if it was.

35:26.646 --> 35:29.431
Well, she was shot
in the foot

35:29.518 --> 35:31.694
and her shoes were missing.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.784
The shoes that she wore
the first time she met Buddy.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.612
That's it?

35:36.699 --> 35:39.702
Well, no. He also has a large
picture of a woman's foot

35:39.789 --> 35:41.617
in a ballet shoe
en pointein his office.

35:41.704 --> 35:45.969
He gets manicures...
at the salon.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.928
He likes to watch women
get pedicures.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.583
- Mm-hmm.
- Gross.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.715
Yeah. Are we listening
here, folks?

35:52.802 --> 35:55.892
[Grace]
'My ankle's actually
feeling betterbut don't stop.'

35:57.459 --> 35:58.721
[ice pack rustling]

36:02.247 --> 36:03.770
You have amazing feet.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.687
- I do?
- Yes.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.167
[chuckles]
Thanks.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.347
There's nothing sexier
than an amazing foot

36:16.783 --> 36:19.655
in an amazing shoe.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.005
Yeah, those were
my favorite pair.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.659
What am I gonna wear home?

36:26.488 --> 36:29.361
Well, I think I may be able
to help you with that.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.711
- Yeah?
- Hold on.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.626
Don't go anywhere.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.105
Okay.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.808
[lock clicks]

36:50.512 --> 36:51.905
[door closes]

36:59.347 --> 37:02.698
You're about a seven
and a half, eight, right?

37:02.785 --> 37:04.222
Yeah.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.489
Well, I think these
should work out.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.931
Yes, I think that will
work just perfectly.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.325
Hmm. Those gold sandals
are gorgeous.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.065
'I love them.'

37:22.152 --> 37:24.024
That's our cue.
Let's go!

37:24.111 --> 37:25.852
[door opens]

37:25.939 --> 37:27.593
Whoa! Put the gun down!

37:27.680 --> 37:29.986
'Don't shoot.'

37:30.073 --> 37:32.380
Uh, wasn't expecting that.

37:32.467 --> 37:35.427
You talk to people
for a living.

37:35.514 --> 37:36.950
But you couldn't talk to me

37:37.037 --> 37:39.344
tell me what you needed.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.389
I wanted to be enough
for you

37:41.476 --> 37:43.435
but I could not compete
with..

37:46.699 --> 37:48.309
...that.

37:48.396 --> 37:50.006
Elizabeth, please,
sweetheart.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.747
Please, please
put the gun down!

37:51.834 --> 37:55.142
Just relax, take it easy,
and nobody will get hurt.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.839
Really, sweetie?

37:56.926 --> 38:00.190
Because you should see
what I did with the last one.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.801
Elizabeth, no.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.457
No, please tell me
you didn't.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.415
What choice did I have?

38:07.502 --> 38:08.634
You weren't gonna stop.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.944
You're not gonna stop.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.642
CBI! Don't move!

38:16.729 --> 38:18.165
Put the gun on the table!

38:20.298 --> 38:21.473
Do it!

38:24.171 --> 38:26.216
Hands behind your back.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.439
You're under arrest.

38:31.526 --> 38:34.355
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.929
[Buddy]
'I had some trysts
a few years back.'

38:43.016 --> 38:46.628
When the show hit big, I knew
I'd have to control myself.

38:46.715 --> 38:49.544
I love Elizabeth.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.764
Why Missy?

38:51.851 --> 38:55.376
I don't expect you
to understand this.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.684
She had the highest arches
I've ever seen.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.514
Exquisite.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.645
The ballistics report
proves

39:03.732 --> 39:05.734
the bullets came
from your gun.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.302
He was sleeping with her,
and you couldn't stand that.

39:08.389 --> 39:09.651
Grace, is it?

39:11.523 --> 39:13.612
You're a pretty young thing.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.657
But it won't last forever.

39:15.744 --> 39:18.530
You think he's still gonna
want you when you're my age?

39:21.794 --> 39:23.796
Of course I couldn't stand it.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.450
He was lying.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.887
And sneaking around
like a horny teenager.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.367
With her.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.805
She called me
to her house to end it.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.851
She said she felt guilty,
taken advantage of.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.289
They wanted to make
their marriage work.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.769
You try to change her mind?

39:40.856 --> 39:42.684
Oh, yeah,
but it didn't work.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.208
She wouldn't take me back.

39:45.295 --> 39:49.735
That's when I asked her
for something to..

39:49.822 --> 39:52.346
...remember her by.

39:54.479 --> 39:58.221
That's when she gave me
the shoes.

39:58.308 --> 40:01.224
Just to get rid of me,
I guess.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.531
I just wanted to scare her
a little.

40:05.141 --> 40:06.752
Tell her to leave him alone.

40:08.623 --> 40:11.974
But then she had the nerve
to call him a creep.

40:12.061 --> 40:13.976
Like she was too good
for him.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.065
I lost it.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.458
[gunshot]

40:19.286 --> 40:20.418
[gunshot]

40:27.468 --> 40:29.992
[gunshot]

40:30.079 --> 40:32.647
And then I still had
all this rage.

40:32.734 --> 40:33.648
[gunshot]

40:48.489 --> 40:50.665
And I have to admit..

40:52.188 --> 40:53.538
...it felt good.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.721
Your brow is furrowed.

41:02.808 --> 41:06.115
You have that squinty look
in your eye.

41:06.202 --> 41:08.901
You wanna talk to me about
the whole foot fetish thing

41:08.988 --> 41:11.251
but the Catholic schoolgirl
in you tells you

41:11.338 --> 41:13.601
that it's not
necessarily appropriate.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.647
You're right.
Look, I don't get it.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.170
I can't wrap my head
around it.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.737
Well, I mean, fetish
is a strong word

41:18.824 --> 41:20.216
but everyone has that thing.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.392
It's just...
it's human nature.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.742
I don't.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.483
Oh, come on, Lisbon.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.615
Don't deny yourself
that freedom.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.617
There's definitely something
out there that works for you

41:29.704 --> 41:32.011
that flips your switch.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.969
- Like turtlenecks.
- You're right.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.668
It's inappropriate.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.931
- Goodnight.
- Turtlenecks it is.

41:40.062 --> 41:42.456
[instrumental music]

42:13.052 --> 42:14.836
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:15.794 --> 42:17.360
What's up?

42:26.761 --> 42:27.849
Yeah?

42:42.037 --> 42:43.952
[theme music]
