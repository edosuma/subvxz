WEBVTT

00:16.766 --> 00:18.018
Holy shit.

00:25.108 --> 00:25.942
Oh!

00:58.391 --> 01:00.393
<i>This is a</i>
<i>Pelham Bay Park bound 6 train.</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:02.729
<i>Next stop, 77th Street, Lenox Hill.</i>

01:02.812 --> 01:04.481
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

01:16.868 --> 01:19.370
-Let me get this for you.
-Ah, a gentleman and a doctor.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.164
You sound like my mother.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.583
Yeah. Easy on the Oedipus. I just woke up.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.126
You back so soon?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.961
I'm a very sick person.

01:27.962 --> 01:28.797
Later.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.300
Polio!

01:44.020 --> 01:46.106
Hey, what's the damage, Ruthie?

01:46.189 --> 01:49.275
It's nothing. Just a fender bender.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.861
It's not as bad as it looks.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.197
Oh, hey, that's what you get
for going to Jersey.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.533
I mean, it's free to get in,
but you gotta pay to get out.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.828
Head wound aside,
you're looking pretty sharp.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.788
Gee, thanks.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.957
There's nothing as invigorating

02:04.040 --> 02:08.711
as that split second of terror
that it's really all over.

02:08.795 --> 02:12.799
Ah. Boy, do I know.
Let's see. What do we got?

02:12.882 --> 02:15.051
-Uh, age?
-Twenty-nine.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.344
Mm-hmm.

02:16.427 --> 02:20.181
-And, uh, any chance you're pregnant?
-Oh! No.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.100
I'll put that down as a yes.

02:22.183 --> 02:26.729
When your mother was pregnant with you,
she ate nothing but Cream of Wheat.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.732
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, Cream of Wheat.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.987
Well, looks like there's now
a "mental illness by proxy" section, so…

02:35.238 --> 02:39.951
…why don't we hop, skip along to,
hey, family history of cancer?

02:40.034 --> 02:41.494
Oh, too much to list.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.580
Yeah. Well, you don't get
to choose your genetics.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.915
Otherwise, I would've been
Nadia Comăneci, right?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.543
All right, what is
the game plan around here?

02:48.626 --> 02:50.795
I mean, is Lenox Hill actually
treating patients today,

02:50.879 --> 02:52.547
or are we just putting on a Beckett play?

02:53.631 --> 02:55.383
Eh, hello, hello.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.719
Hi. How you doing?

02:57.802 --> 03:00.138
Wonder if you have any intel
on my godmother, Ruth Brenner?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.307
You have to wait like everybody else.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.684
Come on, I'm gonna be 40 in ten days.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.768
Happy birthday.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.063
-Great.
-Brenner?

03:09.147 --> 03:10.690
Ruth Brenner?

03:10.773 --> 03:14.319
Ah! Look at that.
Good things come to those who can't wait.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.653
Uh, right this way, please.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.030
Uh, look at this.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.365
A royal treatment, Ruthie.
Thank you so much.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.492
Oh no. Don't need that.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.370
Oh, none of that.
This is just standard protocol.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.955
We've got you covered.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.334
-My fucking knees.
-Okay, there you go. All right.

03:29.417 --> 03:34.214
Immortality is
the great delusion of youth. Oh!

03:34.297 --> 03:36.758
-Enjoy it.
-Me? I've never been young.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.470
Oh please. You'll always be a baby to me.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.263
Almost 40. All right, call me.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.766
-I'll pick you up, the whole routine.
-I will.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.892
Thank you.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.064
Fucking Christ.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.614
Hey, between you and me,
I mean, should she still be driving?

03:59.697 --> 04:01.074
There's no smoking in here.

04:01.157 --> 04:01.991
Uh…

04:02.075 --> 04:04.452
I'm chewing. See? Chewing.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.705
-Come on, baby.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.415
<i>Nemo.</i>
-Hey.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.418
Did you know that human embryos
go through a stage

04:12.502 --> 04:14.837
where they have slits
in their necks like fish?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.130
Isn't that adorbs?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.799
<i>Yes, totally fucking adorable.</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:20.009
Let me tell you something, okay?

04:20.093 --> 04:23.554
Any organ that takes in oxygen
just makes me wanna smoke.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.931
You didn't quit?

04:25.014 --> 04:27.141
<i>Well, it's a process, Maxine.</i>

04:27.225 --> 04:28.643
<i>A process.</i>

04:28.726 --> 04:31.771
Well, you sound stressed.
Maybe you should start up again.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.606
Don't fucking mind game me, all right?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.858
I am keenly aware
that my lungs are essentially

04:35.942 --> 04:37.527
two shriveled up Nick Caves.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.112
Hmm. How's Ruth?

04:39.195 --> 04:40.321
<i>I mean, "How's Ruth?"</i>

04:40.405 --> 04:43.616
How's anyone? I don't know.
She's okay, she's not okay.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.078
I mean, it just never fucking ends.
I've been caretaking for four years.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.956
I'm so sick of doctors
I gotta see a doctor about it.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.417
You should see my shaman.
She totally cured my carpal tunnel.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.002
No, you're missing the point, Maxine.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.504
There's, uh, no witnesses,
you know what I mean?

04:56.587 --> 04:57.714
There's nobody.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.675
There's nobody who's been there
since the beginning. It's only Ruth.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.093
<i>You're doing great, Nemo.</i>

05:02.176 --> 05:04.053
And you know me, I barely lie.

05:04.137 --> 05:04.971
Oh great.

05:05.054 --> 05:08.224
Every time you compliment me,
a cockroach gets its wings.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.268
Okay, let's talk about your party.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.062
I'm thinking absinthe bar, quail eggs--

05:13.146 --> 05:17.483
Listen, I think I'm just gonna
fucking quiet night inzy, all right?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.652
Spend a little time with Alan, all right?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.195
<i>Alan? Alan?</i>

05:21.779 --> 05:22.780
That makes sense.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.658
I've only been your best friend
for 25 years.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.035
We ended up in the same timeline.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.162
Gotta make sure we keep it that way.
Nothing personal.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.373
I'm obviously taking this very personally.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.626
Take it easy. I'm headed into the subway.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.503
<i>I'll see you in, like,</i>
<i>15 minutes, all right?</i>

05:37.587 --> 05:40.548
Oh, can you grab my lacrimatory
from my glass guy?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.800
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Losing you.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.260
<i>Hello? Nadia?</i>

05:44.344 --> 05:46.429
It's just off the G train.
It's really easy.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.740
Hey!

06:05.823 --> 06:06.741
What?

06:07.950 --> 06:08.826
Horse?

06:09.327 --> 06:10.161
What's up?

06:10.745 --> 06:11.829
Nora?

06:12.413 --> 06:13.247
It's me.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.041
Haircut.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.752
You waiting for the train?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.004
Yeah, I'm waiting for the train.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.965
You gonna stand there,
and a long metal tube is gonna show up

06:23.049 --> 06:24.008
and open its doors,

06:24.092 --> 06:27.011
and then you're gonna, maybe,
I don't know, sit down on a seat?

06:27.095 --> 06:29.305
Yeah, I was gonna do all that.
I'm gonna find a seat.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.223
Me too.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.809
You waiting for the fucking train?

06:32.892 --> 06:33.935
What?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.647
Hey, fuck you too, man.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.468
Ballsy move, dude.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.138
Do you want my seat?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.306
Look, man, I'm not gonna fuck you.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.809
Good. You definitely shouldn't.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.520
<i>Cats, </i>huh?

07:19.480 --> 07:20.398
Not my thing.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.316
<i> The 6 train</i>
<i>is now running express.</i>

07:22.400 --> 07:24.068
<i>Next stop, Astor Place.</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:26.279
<i>Sophie's Choice. </i>That's funny.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.908
All right, what is this? Some kind of,
like, uh, eighties flash mob?

07:34.078 --> 07:35.079
Ah, great.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.415
Hey, Travis Bickle,
what year do you think it is, man?

07:37.498 --> 07:38.624
Zero.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.768
"Two faces of John LeBoutillier…

07:59.562 --> 08:02.064
who we transformed…"

08:05.651 --> 08:06.903
Nineteen…

08:09.071 --> 08:10.281
eighty-two.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.790
How you doing there?

08:20.541 --> 08:21.375
Okay.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.087
Max's Kansas City, etcetera. All right.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.465
All right, very effective.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.842
Very effective.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.391
<i>Now arriving Astor Place.</i>

08:37.475 --> 08:39.268
Stop that man! Stop him!

08:42.438 --> 08:43.523
Okay, man.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
Holy fucking shit.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.151
-Fuck.
-Hey, hey, hey.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.819
-You all right?
What? Who are you?

08:48.903 --> 08:51.364
-Why are you wearing red berets?
-Uh, Guardian Angels, ma'am.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.075
One person can make a difference
as long as others dare to care.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.661
Are you all right, ma'am?
Do you need help getting home? Anything?

08:56.744 --> 08:59.622
Yeah. I would say, uh, sure.
I really need to get home, yeah.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.374
-All right, come on. Exit's this way.
-Okay.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.959
-Take your time. Here we go.
-All right.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.461
All right. You look great. You look great.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.462
Watch yourself.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.590
Now, right up there, to the left.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.300
-Get home safely, okay?
-Yeah. All right.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.218
All right.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.653
Hey. Hey.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.947
Do you believe in the future
of our humanity?

09:33.030 --> 09:34.532
Define future.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.951
We're building
thermonuclear weapons left and right.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.287
We're fucking Gaia,
and we don't know where the clit is.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.206
You gotta know where the clitoris is.
That's why they always say that.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.084
Radiation from thermonuclear weapons
causes genetic changes

09:45.167 --> 09:47.044
that are inherited by future generations.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.505
If we don't do something, we're fucked!

09:49.589 --> 09:52.300
Our kids are fucked,
and our kids' kids are fucked.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.135
Where the fuck is my fucking phone?

09:55.970 --> 09:56.804
Shit.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.556
This is…

10:00.349 --> 10:01.684
"The Black Gumball."

10:03.352 --> 10:05.229
The fuck is Chez?

10:07.481 --> 10:08.316
Huh.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.109
Hey, man.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.360
Hey, yeah, you.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.071
You know where this place is?

10:15.906 --> 10:18.075
-By the park.
-All right, cool.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.328
Cool. Good luck
with your fucking clitoris.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.225
Hey, watch it. Watch it.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.479
Fucking psychedelic.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.734
That is so fucking weird.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.039
What is this?

11:15.716 --> 11:19.720
Of course, American religion
at its core has always been consumerism,

11:19.804 --> 11:22.139
but now the illusion's fading away

11:22.223 --> 11:24.934
and we're left worshiping
the thing itself.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.395
The pursuit of money for money's sake.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.563
Great. You gonna pay for that drink now?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.440
Hey, man, can I get a bourbon?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.275
Bourbon? You sure about that, hon?

11:33.359 --> 11:36.278
Yeah, hon.
It's arguably the only thing I'm sure of.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.115
Basic concepts like time and space
are suddenly eluding me.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.118
I mean, last night this place
was mayhem 'cause Wi-Fi went out,

11:42.201 --> 11:43.994
but in the new here and now, uh,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.747
apparently gratuitous nudity
is back in play.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.126
Well, my past, your future.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.627
Begs the question,

11:51.711 --> 11:54.588
am I haunting you, are you haunting me?

11:54.672 --> 11:57.258
You seem pretty relaxed for a ghost.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.052
Well, when the universe
fucks with you,

12:00.136 --> 12:01.011
let it.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.348
Tell you what I did not expect,

12:04.432 --> 12:08.144
is for the 6 train to run through
some kind of a wormhole.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.228
Hit me, please.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.813
You're a time traveler.

12:10.896 --> 12:11.772
Eh…

12:11.856 --> 12:14.108
I prefer the term "time prisoner."

12:14.191 --> 12:16.444
Mmm.
What happens to me in the future?

12:16.527 --> 12:17.361
Mmm.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.238
I don't know who you are, guy.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.283
Danny.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.786
Holy fucking shit.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.705
Crazy Eddie's.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.081
No fucking way.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.753
I wish more women had
that kind of enthusiasm about my day job.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.546
Look at that, I'll tell you your future.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.840
In about a second,
you offer me a cigarette.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.552
-Prescient.
-Thanks, Danny from 1982.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.637
Nadia. Oh, and, uh,
not to piss in your drink,

12:43.721 --> 12:45.973
but your boss goes away
for securities fraud.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.350
-Man, get the fuck outta here.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.268
Fuck.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.646
Asshole.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.277
There she is.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.494
Let's go, babe.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.663
How you doing?
Uh, here's my rule on strangers.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.915
They, uh,

13:10.998 --> 13:14.043
they stand at a distance,
500 feet away from me,

13:14.126 --> 13:16.796
and then, you know,
I just never see 'em again.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.088
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.218
Is this about 500 feet?

13:22.301 --> 13:23.969
Watch it, that's my ear.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.513
-Oh, I know.
-Hey, Chez.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.431
You fucking owe me.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.935
Oh, so you must be
Chez from the matchbook then.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.102
We gotta go, babe.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.271
Seriously, we gotta go.
Come on.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.523
-All right.
-Really. For real.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.149
-Okay.
-Come on.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.652
-Here we go.
-All right. All right.

13:39.735 --> 13:40.945
That's on you, Danny.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.571
-Here we go.
-Okay, Nadia.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.950
I don't wanna go back in there.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.451
It's a bad atmosphere.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.205
Yeah. Funny how the vibe changes
when you rip off a cokehead.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.957
Okay, okay.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.375
You're definitely nervous.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.584
I gotcha.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.546
Now, lady's choice.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.006
'Ludes or beauties?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.716
Holy fucking shit.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.385
Black beauties.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.345
My God, I thought these were just legend.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.347
Huh?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.934
All right, fuck it.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.228
Looks like Purim came early this year.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.272
Ah.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.648
'Lude for later.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.191
That's my girl.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.118
Right now, we're nobodies.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.162
You bump into some yuppie asshole
on the street,

14:32.246 --> 14:34.623
his eyes glaze over
like you don't even exist,

14:35.165 --> 14:39.420
just because we don't buy into
their Ozzie and Harriet version of life.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.547
Uh, who do you think I am?

14:41.630 --> 14:43.007
Okay.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.174
Okay, you got the keys?

14:44.842 --> 14:45.843
What keys?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.846
Check your pockets. The keys.

14:48.929 --> 14:49.763
All right.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.601
Are you fucking kidding me?
Why don't I help you, huh?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.604
Huh? New game. I help you find your keys.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.646
-All right.
-Yeah.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.315
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-That's good.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.733
-Okay.
-Okay, got 'em.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.904
Okay. If by "them" you mean
my pussy lips in a twist, uh,

15:04.987 --> 15:06.238
mission accomplished.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.615
Let's go.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.033
-Huh.
-Let's go.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.494
"Chezare Carrera."

15:13.996 --> 15:14.955
Hail, Caesar.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.249
Hey. Come on.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.586
Okay.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.934
-Shit.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.414
Okay.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.386
Fuck! Go! Go!

16:10.970 --> 16:11.971
Go, go, go, go!

16:14.640 --> 16:16.266
Open the fucking door.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.309
Shit.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.728
Gotta go.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.605
Just be cool. Yeah.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.401
I'm fucking hard right now. Are you ready?

16:25.484 --> 16:26.944
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna eat your pussy.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.279
-All right, I'll take it.
-Okay, come on.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.509
Hey, where's my-- Where's my wallet?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.928
Mmm. Quick background check.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.305
Don't take offense.
I do it to every guy I meet.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.473
Jesus, I love you.

17:00.102 --> 17:04.023
Thing is, they don't want us
moving up in the world, babe.

17:04.106 --> 17:04.940
Nah.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.569
Whole system is a fucking racket.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.195
It's bullshit.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.531
"Stay down. Stay in your place."

17:12.614 --> 17:13.824
You know what I say?

17:14.491 --> 17:15.659
I say fuck that.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.121
Gotta take control of your life.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.582
And that is what we're doing.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.295
Huh?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.254
We…

17:28.589 --> 17:29.548
you and me,

17:29.631 --> 17:32.259
are taking control.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.267
Uh…

17:41.143 --> 17:42.811
I gotta take a leak.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.439
My bladder's
really fucking my dick tonight.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.274
Mmm.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.526
-Oh boy.
-Yeah, just two secs.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.612
Where is it? There?

17:51.695 --> 17:53.781
Um-- Yeah.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.033
Yeah, I'll find it. I'm a compass.

17:56.116 --> 17:56.950
What?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.578
-All right.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.251
Jesus. Fuck.

18:07.002 --> 18:07.836
Okay.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.507
Very good. Yeah.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.259
Yeah, all right.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.303
-Okay.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.854
Not bad.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.191
Hey.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.990
It's very fucked up. Yeah.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.701
All right.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.519
What the fuck?

19:21.410 --> 19:22.286
Mom?

19:31.837 --> 19:32.796
Yo.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.048
Yo, yo, yo.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.698
Wait…

20:10.500 --> 20:11.501
Hey, babe?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.379
Lenora?

20:43.909 --> 20:44.952
Oh, hi, Nora.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.997
Uh, hey, yeah. How you doing, man?

20:49.081 --> 20:49.915
Nora.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.625
Ah-ha!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.294
Okay. Sorry, man.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.547
Subway token and an eating disorder.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.077
Is it 2022 in here?

21:30.330 --> 21:32.582
<i>Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors.</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:03.989
A millennial. Ah-ha!

22:08.535 --> 22:10.537
-Alan, open up.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.040
Fuck.

22:16.376 --> 22:19.087
For the last time,
that key is for emergencies.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.256
You cannot just come by
when you're in the neighborhood

22:21.340 --> 22:22.466
and need to use the bathroom.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.509
How's this for an emergency?

22:25.010 --> 22:28.638
The universe finally found something
worse than death.

22:28.722 --> 22:29.765
Being my mother.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.016
What?

22:31.099 --> 22:32.017
Cool.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.853
So, just happening to me then.

22:35.937 --> 22:36.772
Great.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.940
I--

22:39.733 --> 22:41.068
I wish I knew what to say,

22:41.151 --> 22:43.153
but I'm just not taking
the 6 train into my mom. Nah.

22:43.236 --> 22:47.699
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe we have unfinished business.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.285
We have spent your past three birthdays
on DEFCON 1

22:50.369 --> 22:51.661
just in case we start dying.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.414
I'm standing here looking at us,
and we're both very much alive.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.791
Ask yourself this,

22:56.375 --> 22:57.626
are you happy?

22:57.709 --> 23:01.254
Yeah, I'm fine. I just--
I think this is what life feels like.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.464
Is it though?

23:03.256 --> 23:04.674
Look, you believe me, right?

23:04.758 --> 23:07.803
Yeah. Yeah, of course,
I be-- I believe you.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.805
Proof. I've got proof.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.224
You can tell I was really in the eighties

23:12.307 --> 23:16.061
because I got a nuclear war pamphlet
from some fucking weirdo

23:16.561 --> 23:20.232
who was, like,
really into nuclear war pamphlets.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.401
The fuck?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.777
You-- You can show me later.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.446
I'm late to meet up with a new girl
that my mom set me up with.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.490
-It's-- It's a date a week now.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.408
Huh.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.077
Anyway, people don't like it
when you are not punctual.

23:32.160 --> 23:32.994
It's---

23:33.620 --> 23:34.579
It's unattractive.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.959
I gotta say, I expected you
to be more onboard with this.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.586
Shit. I gotta go check on Ruth.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.714
Hey man, what happened to that other girl?
The one with the, uh, you know--

23:44.798 --> 23:46.258
-The dog?
-Teeth. Wasn't it--

23:46.341 --> 23:47.426
Long-- long teeth.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.219
Yeah, that was three months ago.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.972
Oh really? That's too bad. I liked her.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.348
Well, what's going on with Ruth?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.642
She's back at Lenox Hill.
You know, shit never ends.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.645
Fender bender,
but, like, revoke her license already.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.938
You tell her that I said hi.

24:00.021 --> 24:02.441
And, uh, isn't it too late
for a hospital visit?

24:02.524 --> 24:03.692
She's a New Yorker, Alan.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.529
Plus, she's the only one who might know
what was going on between my mom and Chez.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.697
Wait, who-- who is Chez?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.532
Some type of Paul Snider character.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.161
Now I don't expect you to get that.
It's a<i> Star 80 </i>reference. Very deep cut.

24:14.244 --> 24:17.289
To be clear, that cokehead
is not my fucking father.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.459
I know who my father is,
and he's primarily alcoholic.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.462
Okay, Nadia,
do-- do I need to be worried about you?

24:23.545 --> 24:26.006
Well, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

24:26.089 --> 24:29.176
Hey, you're loving and you deserve love.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.096
Call me when you're inside your mom,
you fucking sicko.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.775
Hi, Ruthie.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.281
I mean, my best friend just had a baby,

24:51.364 --> 24:54.743
and, like, she's already setting up
interviews at private preschools,

24:54.826 --> 24:57.037
which is so competitive here.

24:57.120 --> 25:01.166
And, I don't know. I mean,
my friends all say that it's great…

25:01.249 --> 25:02.834
-Let me ask you a question.
-What?

25:02.918 --> 25:05.045
Do you remember an old boyfriend of mom's,

25:05.128 --> 25:07.214
a Chezare Carrera?

25:08.215 --> 25:10.967
Your mother had terrible taste in men.

25:11.051 --> 25:14.846
And, you know, God,
she couldn't ever resist a con man.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.224
Oh, looks like you've got company.

25:17.307 --> 25:21.228
Yes, this is Nadia, my honorary daughter.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.772
It's nice
to have someone to look after you.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.649
-Can I have your arm, dear?
-Mm-hmm. Mmm.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.360
Okay. So, uh, Chezare, yeah?

25:28.443 --> 25:30.779
Oh yeah. He's the one that was around

25:30.862 --> 25:33.823
when your mother lost
all the family money.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.243
Wait, what do you mean?
The gold? The Krugerrands?

25:36.326 --> 25:37.285
That guy?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.704
Outstanding prick.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.202
Bingo, bitch.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.746
Hey.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.414
Where'd you go?

27:46.498 --> 27:47.374
Uh…

27:48.166 --> 27:49.376
cigarettes.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.545
You got pregnancy brain?

27:52.629 --> 27:54.089
Would you look at that.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.467
Bennett & Hammond
Ultra Light mentholated 100s.

27:57.550 --> 27:58.510
That's fucking gross.

27:58.593 --> 27:59.511
Yeah.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.721
You got a whole box.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.264
Neat. Uh…

28:04.140 --> 28:05.517
whose place did we rob?

28:06.226 --> 28:07.143
What?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.687
Was it Vera?

28:08.770 --> 28:12.524
Like, did you steal
my grandma's Krugerrands?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.317
Your grandma?

28:15.151 --> 28:16.820
Babe, whoa, okay, just--

28:17.946 --> 28:19.698
I didn't do jack shit.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.615
We…

28:20.699 --> 28:22.158
We did it together.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.452
Oh God.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.039
Babe, are you-- are you sure you're okay?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.291
You having second thoughts now?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.044
Oh.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.963
No, no. Uh…

28:36.589 --> 28:38.633
…I'm all the way in. Yeah.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.884
Are you sure?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.136
Yeah.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.429
-Hey.
-Okay.

28:43.012 --> 28:43.888
Hey.

28:45.473 --> 28:49.018
I was waiting for you, okay?
Don't run off like that on me again, okay?

28:49.102 --> 28:50.270
Mm-hmm.

28:50.353 --> 28:51.604
You had me worried.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.315
There's two of you now.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.534
What's going on down here?

29:05.201 --> 29:06.035
Yeah.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.620
Leopard's come out to play, huh?

29:07.704 --> 29:09.205
Look at that. Tony the tiger.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.750
Oh yeah. Yeah, the tiger.
Yeah, Tony on there for you.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.667
Yeah.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.961
You just left me and ran out on me.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.338
Tony's really upset, and he kind of--

29:17.422 --> 29:20.175
-Oh God. Yes. Yes.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.885
Okay. Okay.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.303
