11:30.385 --> 11:31.821
Where are you?

11:34.389 --> 11:36.696
Your father wanted us
to have a little chat.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.611
[high-pitched ringing]

11:39.655 --> 11:41.657
[heart beating]

12:06.595 --> 12:09.206
If this is too weird for you...

12:20.130 --> 12:22.002
Better?

12:22.045 --> 12:24.221
It's still kind of weird.

12:24.265 --> 12:27.007
This is my true form.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.750
Or, at least, it used to be.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.839
Ferrying souls
for a few millennia

12:32.882 --> 12:36.320
takes quite a toll on one's
skin care routine. [chuckles]

12:36.364 --> 12:39.019
I'm sorry,
but what is happening?

12:39.062 --> 12:40.847
You're cute
when you're flummoxed.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.719
I just... I thought
we could chat.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.330
Get to know
each other a little.

12:46.374 --> 12:49.420
My name is Lynn, by the way.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.771
And that...

12:53.773 --> 12:55.339
...was home.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.777
Peace.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.910
Or as some like
to call it, Valhalla.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.477
That means you're a...

13:02.520 --> 13:04.348
God?

13:04.392 --> 13:07.438
We didn't know it at the time.
We thought we were normal.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.745
It wasn't until we met humans
that we actually understood

13:09.789 --> 13:11.355
that we were
different.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.618
I-It's a lot to take in.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.448
But you need to hear
the whole story.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.582
Because I need your help.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.106
ETHAN:
Just spit it out.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.761
Come on.
We stopped training

13:25.805 --> 13:28.111
because you needed
a milkshake all of a sudden.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.287
And then we walked all the way
into town to get one

13:30.331 --> 13:31.898
instead of just going
to the school kitchen,

13:31.941 --> 13:35.205
and now we're taking
the long way back.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.424
You're stalling.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.121
Fine.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.775
I don't think you should be
part of the battle.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.429
I knew it.It's too dangerous.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.692
MG, I'm back in control
of my jumps.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.955
I can just not use my powers.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.479
You can't ask me to sit
on the sidelines again.

13:48.523 --> 13:49.785
I'm not.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.700
I'm asking you to leave town.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.529
For your own good, Ethan,
just go home.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.139
[tires screeching]

13:56.183 --> 13:58.185
[horn honks]

14:07.585 --> 14:09.239
[panting]

14:12.547 --> 14:13.983
"SISTO."

14:16.246 --> 14:18.466
This isn't real, is it?

14:24.559 --> 14:25.821
I'm sorry.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.520
But I couldn't find
another way to convince you.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.698
If you see someone in trouble,

14:33.742 --> 14:36.223
you won't be able
to stop yourself.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.399
You're too much
of a hero.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.576
That's why you can't be
part of the fight.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.927
KALEB:
I didn't want to believe it.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.276
Doc said that you
were going back

14:46.320 --> 14:47.974
in there, even after
you almost got hurt.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.018
Look, if you're here
to stop me...

14:49.062 --> 14:50.890
I'm not here
to stop you.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.718
I just need clarification
on a few boyfriend rules.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.199
So, I'm not allowed
to make choices for you

14:56.243 --> 14:57.897
or to be overprotective,
unless it's an emergency

14:57.940 --> 14:59.637
or that's something
you need me to be.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.335
But you don't have to tell
me what you're planning

15:01.378 --> 15:03.119
because you're afraid
I'll overreact.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.947
Basically.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.689
[laughs]:
You know you drive me crazy.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.038
I'll be careful.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.474
I need you
to be careful

15:10.518 --> 15:12.215
and be armed.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.135
Look, this thing probably
has woo-woo god magic.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.832
It already traveled
from whatever plane of reality

15:20.876 --> 15:22.443
that was to our world.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.532
Maybe you can
use it in there.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.884
You take good care of me.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.104
I try.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.236
And that's your favorite thing
about me?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.716
Eh.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.239
No?
Nah.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.458
Damn.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.808
I'm-a figureit out.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.549
I'll be right here, okay?

15:41.592 --> 15:43.333
If it looks like you're
in trouble, I'm coming in.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.119
Kaleb.
Look, y-you said it
wasn't just a vision.

15:46.162 --> 15:49.252
It was more like some kind
of mental connection.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.993
That means I can
head-dive my way in.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.996
Which I will do
at the first sign of trouble.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.998
Hmm?

16:01.743 --> 16:03.310
[sighs]

16:05.486 --> 16:06.704
[sighs]

16:06.748 --> 16:07.923
[sighs]

16:16.584 --> 16:18.629
[crows cawing]

16:25.375 --> 16:28.248
I was asleep when you entered
my mind before.

16:32.730 --> 16:35.907
This time, I'm awake.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.482
KEN:
It doesn't have
to be this way.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.832
Hostile, combative.

16:47.876 --> 16:51.271
There was a time where your kind
and mine worked in harmony.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.361
And what "kind" am I?

16:55.579 --> 16:56.972
You don't know?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.235
Then you're in luck.

16:59.279 --> 17:02.804
By the end of this, you'll know
who you were meant to be.

17:02.847 --> 17:06.982
This connection we're sharing,
you entering my mind,

17:07.026 --> 17:11.160
it's the hallmark
of a unique magical ability.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.467
When an oracle
interferes in their visions,

17:13.510 --> 17:17.775
changing the future, they
transform into something else.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.780
You're one of the Furies now.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.262
You're the last of the Furies.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.569
I killed the others

17:28.612 --> 17:32.703
when they stopped being...
collaborative.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.793
You and I are
nature's balance.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.492
It created this space,
a bridge between us

17:38.535 --> 17:42.322
so that we can confer,
share council, warn each other.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.063
Reach an accord.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.947
We can be civilized,
you and I.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.431
There's really only one person
who needs to die.

18:04.474 --> 18:05.867
The Tribrid.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.129
[laughs softly]

18:07.173 --> 18:09.131
You can't kill her.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.002
The Red Oak is gone.

18:11.046 --> 18:15.746
And if I had the ashes
of one of those Red Oak stakes?

18:15.790 --> 18:19.010
Forged into a weapon
made by a god?

18:19.054 --> 18:20.882
That would work, wouldn't it?

18:23.798 --> 18:24.973
Good.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.888
My offer is this:

18:26.931 --> 18:28.716
bring Hope to me

18:28.759 --> 18:31.284
and I will let
everyone else live.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.721
Refuse,

18:33.764 --> 18:37.507
and all the deaths that come
after this will be on you

18:37.551 --> 18:40.728
and you alone.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.817
[footsteps approaching]

18:45.211 --> 18:48.039
Did you figure out
who the triggerman is gonna be?

18:48.083 --> 18:50.085
Still working on it.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.174
[exhales]

18:52.218 --> 18:53.828
What's wrong?

18:53.871 --> 18:55.786
Besides the end
of the world, I mean.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.095
MG told me he loves me.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.838
Wow.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.840
Okay, um...

19:05.883 --> 19:08.059
Did you say it back?

19:08.103 --> 19:10.497
I didn't say anything.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.847
I just froze.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.197
And then I was supposed
to help him with Ethan, but...

19:15.241 --> 19:19.027
I just chickened out again
and ran away.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.898
It's weird.

19:20.942 --> 19:24.902
It's like I don't even want
to ask myself the question.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.383
Maybe you're afraid
of getting an answer.

19:27.427 --> 19:28.950
Once you have one,

19:28.993 --> 19:30.604
nothing's gonna be the same.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.737
[exhales]
Exactly.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.174
How did you know?

19:35.217 --> 19:37.480
I've been doing the same thing.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.308
I've been avoiding part
of the battle plan

19:39.352 --> 19:42.398
because I didn't want to know
who we were gonna lose.

19:42.442 --> 19:45.184
But I asked myself
the question.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.925
I hate this, but...

19:50.101 --> 19:52.147
I think you should know
who it is.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.464
JED:
Nice.

20:04.507 --> 20:05.813
All right, you guys,
bring those over there, okay?

20:05.856 --> 20:06.988
And then we'll do it.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.208
Yeah. Exactly.
Take 'em there.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
Get some water over here!

20:12.428 --> 20:14.517
This whole place is gonna blow.

20:18.304 --> 20:21.394
Water would just make
the chain reaction bigger.

20:21.437 --> 20:24.179
You have to make
a chemical solution to stop it.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.702
I asked the expert.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.269
You know, the one
you didn't allow to come help?

20:27.313 --> 20:28.618
He gave me the whole plan.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.316
JED: Yeah, well,
we're not using it.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.187
Okay? Ben just wants to help
because he feels guilty,

20:32.231 --> 20:34.233
and I'm not gonna accept
and pretend that I forgive him.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.451
Okay?

20:35.495 --> 20:36.931
Well, he's not

20:36.974 --> 20:38.367
just doing this for you.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.629
And he's right.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.588
This is bigger
than the two of you.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.243
You're letting your personal
feelings put us at risk.

20:50.510 --> 20:54.035
I asked Dr. Saltzman
why he trusted Ben.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.298
He told me Ben offered
to sacrifice his life

20:56.342 --> 20:58.822
to protect
the whole school.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.346
So I think the least you can do

21:00.389 --> 21:02.783
is be willing to sacrifice
your pride.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.440
All right, tell me
what he said we should do.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.790
LYNN:
The gods were happy once.

21:09.833 --> 21:13.750
Every god
except my brother Ken.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.578
His insatiable desire
for conquest

21:15.622 --> 21:16.971
led him to find new places

21:17.014 --> 21:19.843
where he could be
feared and loved.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.498
We crossed into your world.

21:22.542 --> 21:26.067
That's when
wars intensified.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.417
More and more humans
started arriving

21:28.461 --> 21:30.767
in Limbo.

21:30.811 --> 21:34.336
It started as a slow trickle,
and then it became a flood.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.512
And it seemed

21:36.556 --> 21:38.862
so unfair.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.734
I saw these poor souls

21:40.777 --> 21:43.911
lost to wander
in the darkness forever.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.087
So I did something stupid.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.917
I took pity.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.703
I found a mother and child
who had died for no reason,

21:53.747 --> 21:57.533
and I thought, since the gods
had taken away their happiness,

21:57.577 --> 22:01.363
I should ferry them across
to Peace.

22:01.407 --> 22:05.062
We colonized their world,
so I settled them in ours.

22:06.063 --> 22:09.719
When Ken found out,
he cursed me.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.418
If I was so interested
in helping humans,

22:12.461 --> 22:15.943
he would force me to do it
for all eternity.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.337
Never to return home.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.034
Always

22:20.077 --> 22:22.428
reaching the shore,

22:22.471 --> 22:25.953
but never able
to actually set foot there.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.441
So, that's
what I've been doing

22:35.484 --> 22:38.531
for the last... 10,000 years?

22:38.574 --> 22:40.533
Give or take.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.013
That's heavy.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.060
I'm sorry.

22:46.103 --> 22:48.497
I did it to myself.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.413
But now I am ready to quit.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.850
Hang up the robes for good.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.896
You see,
even though I'm cursed...

22:55.939 --> 22:57.941
There's always a loophole.
[sighs]

22:57.985 --> 22:59.552
Trust me, I know.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.771
Well, the loophole
in my curse

23:01.815 --> 23:04.948
is I can stop ferrying souls
and go home

23:04.992 --> 23:08.474
if I can find someone
willing to take my place.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.866
But in all the centuries,

23:09.910 --> 23:13.087
I've never met
anyone willing to do it.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.176
For the right reasons, at least.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.224
Until I met you.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.489
ALARIC:
Well,

23:23.532 --> 23:25.229
this is a first.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.841
Never been called into my own
office before. [chuckles]

23:29.582 --> 23:31.497
[exhales]

23:31.540 --> 23:33.977
I was right about the plan,
wasn't I?

23:34.021 --> 23:36.806
Our best chance is triggering
the god bomb up front.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.721
[sighs]

23:38.765 --> 23:41.507
Well, I know this
isn't gonna be easy for you.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.291
You've experienced
more loss

23:43.334 --> 23:45.206
than anyone your age

the time you have left together.

your own advice.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.265

Ken at the exact moment
