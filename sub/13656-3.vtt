<i>Previously in Major Crimes...</i>

00:01.947 --> 00:04.174
Provenza.
Captain Raydor was transferred...

00:04.209 --> 00:06.577
from Force Investigation division
to Major Crimes,

00:06.611 --> 00:09.788
Making her your ranking officer,
effective immediately.

00:09.823 --> 00:12.126
We're changing the
focus of Major Crimes.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.390
You're talking about plea bargains.

00:14.424 --> 00:17.419
We don't have the legal
authority to make deals.

00:17.454 --> 00:18.721
Prosecutors do.

00:18.756 --> 00:20.889
You want to arrest someone for murder,

00:20.923 --> 00:24.362
then turn them over to the
courts to decide their fate.

00:24.396 --> 00:26.395
I want to walk them directly
to their prison cell.

00:26.430 --> 00:30.195
This is a chance for us to
properly finish what we started,

00:30.229 --> 00:32.833
and that is something
that I really like.

00:32.867 --> 00:36.370
You are a material
witness in a murder trial.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.837
And until then, we need to find
a safe place for you to stay.

00:39.872 --> 00:42.241
From what I can tell,
Rusty is in good hands here...

00:42.275 --> 00:46.432
Nno, you are happy to lock me up until
I testify in your stupid murder trial,

00:46.467 --> 00:49.134
which is why nobody is
bothering to look for my mom.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.903
Rusty, we're doing everything
we can to find your mother.

00:50.938 --> 00:53.706
I've got a want out on
her and her boyfriend.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.907
We are going to come
across them any day.

I just want to have

01:44.589 --> 01:46.224
Yeah, right.

01:46.258 --> 01:49.223
You just want him to see
what he's missing, girl, and you know it.

01:49.258 --> 01:50.595
Yeah, that's why she got
those five-inch heels.

01:50.629 --> 01:53.470
No, it's not, and I don't
even care if I ever see ...

01:53.505 --> 01:54.266
Watch out!

02:30.874 --> 02:32.475
Hey! Hey!

02:32.509 --> 02:33.676
Hey, lady, what the
hell's wrong with you?

02:33.711 --> 02:35.245
You drunk or something?

02:35.279 --> 02:36.880
Hey! Hey, this bitch
is drunk off her ass!

02:36.914 --> 02:38.615
Hey, that's my brother!

02:38.649 --> 02:40.584
That's my brother on
the ground over there!

02:40.618 --> 02:42.252
What the hell is wrong with you?!

02:42.287 --> 02:43.621
Leave me alone.

02:43.655 --> 02:44.855
Do you even know
what you did?! Huh?!

02:44.890 --> 02:48.359
Hey! Come on! Get off her!

02:50.696 --> 02:52.764
Oh, man! Hey!
Hey, someone's over here!

02:52.799 --> 02:54.567
Someone's under here! Help me!

02:58.472 --> 03:00.306
Pull her out!

03:02.977 --> 03:05.946
Oh, my... oh, my god!

03:05.980 --> 03:11.285
Somebody ...  somebody, please!
Do something!

03:13.989 --> 03:15.623
That's enough, Buzz.

03:15.657 --> 03:16.791
<i>Do something!</i>

03:16.826 --> 03:17.826
Turn it off.

03:24.867 --> 03:29.871
The name's Vanessa
Farrelly, 21, UCLA junior.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.439
And, uh...?

03:31.474 --> 03:34.343
Oh, including those two,
that makes three dead.

03:34.377 --> 03:35.878
Nine injured ...
four critically ...

03:35.912 --> 03:37.679
all on their way to the hospital.

03:37.714 --> 03:39.715
What do we know about the driver?

03:39.749 --> 03:42.084
Well, I just spoke to the paramedic
taking her to St. Stephen's.

03:42.118 --> 03:45.021
He said she's pretty banged up ...
broken arm, broken nose.

03:45.055 --> 03:46.723
The crowd knocked her unconscious, sir.

03:46.757 --> 03:49.960
Paramedic say anything about
booze on the suspect's breath?

03:49.994 --> 03:52.095
No. But he did say she
was slurring her words,

03:52.130 --> 03:54.098
and she seemed pretty
wobbly on the video.

03:54.132 --> 03:55.933
Well, that could've
been from the impact.

03:55.967 --> 03:57.568
Sir, we did have a 911 call

03:57.602 --> 03:59.870
placed less than two
minutes before the crash.

03:59.904 --> 04:01.071
Caller was on Wilshire.

04:01.106 --> 04:03.842
Said he was nearly run off the road
by the driver of a silver S.U.V...

04:03.876 --> 04:05.677
Wilshire's just a few blocks thataway.

04:05.711 --> 04:08.847
You know, I talked to S.C.I.D.
They've been over the vehicle.

04:08.881 --> 04:12.017
Steering's fine. Brakes are fine.
No mechanical malfunction.

04:12.051 --> 04:15.353
Yeah, and no skid marks, so
she never even tried to stop.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.023
Did we find any evidence
of alcohol or drugs in here?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.358
No, but there might be something
in the purse down on the floor,

04:20.392 --> 04:21.959
but patrol saw it,
and it was zipped shut.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.363
Well, let's open it and say
it spilled during the crash.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.065
No, no, no, no, no.
Too many victims.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.937
We need a truce with Ray...
Captain Raydor on this case.

04:29.971 --> 04:32.105
Sanchez, you make sure the hospital

04:32.140 --> 04:34.508
gets the blood-alcohol
content of our suspect.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.811
Tao, Sykes, and I will
handle the notifications.

04:38.613 --> 04:41.115
Flynn, do this one by the book.

04:41.149 --> 04:45.596
Whatever's in this purse
is not going anywhere, so...

04:45.631 --> 04:49.059
you get a warrant
before you dump it out.

04:49.093 --> 04:50.428
- Got it?
- Got it.

04:50.462 --> 04:53.731
You wouldn't believe how many
judges are out of town this weekend.

04:53.766 --> 04:56.634
- Suspect still lights out?
- Last I checked, Lieutenant.

04:56.669 --> 04:58.969
She's not going anywhere.
Is that the warrant?

04:59.004 --> 05:01.806
Yeah. What about her
blood-alcohol content?

05:01.840 --> 05:03.908
Well, the lab's gonna
call you with the results

05:03.942 --> 05:07.411
as soon as they come in.
Let's open it up.

05:16.891 --> 05:19.059
Name's Leslie Nolan.
Silver Lake address.

05:19.093 --> 05:21.828
She's an organ donor.
She's also a Doctor.

05:21.862 --> 05:23.196
So let's assume she'll have a lawyer.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.098
Oh, I bet she'll have a
medical condition, too,

05:25.132 --> 05:26.900
with symptoms that
fit with her accident.

05:26.934 --> 05:29.803
Suspect's a resident in neuropsychiatry.

05:29.837 --> 05:31.972
Probably gonna blame
the crash on narcolepsy

05:32.006 --> 05:34.041
or some other psych B.S.

05:34.075 --> 05:36.043
Which won't matter if her blood
alcohol is through the roof.

05:36.077 --> 05:38.612
But just to be safe,
let's see the results of any other

05:38.646 --> 05:40.814
tests she's
undergone since she arrived.

05:40.848 --> 05:42.149
"Oh, hey, Rusty, what
are you doing here?"

05:42.183 --> 05:43.817
Nothing, just, uh,
being dragged out of bed

05:43.851 --> 05:46.587
at 6:00 in the morning because
I must be supervised 24/7.

05:46.621 --> 05:47.955
How about you guys?

05:47.989 --> 05:49.857
"Oh, just exhausted
from all of the hard work

05:49.891 --> 05:51.492
we've been doing on your behalf."

05:51.526 --> 05:55.229
Wow. I can't thank you all enough.
You guys are... fantastic.

05:55.263 --> 06:00.035
Oh, you're through already?
'Cause that was hilarious.

06:00.069 --> 06:03.038
Excuse me, Detective.
Your suspect is conscious.

06:03.072 --> 06:04.606
Uh, Lieutenant,

06:04.641 --> 06:07.243
don't say anything,
but Reno P.D. alerted me.

06:07.277 --> 06:09.178
They may have already
found Rusty's mother.

06:09.212 --> 06:12.482
No kidding.
Reno P.D. What a surprise.

06:12.516 --> 06:15.151
So maybe now you'll get rid
of the little psycho, huh?

06:15.185 --> 06:19.956
Oh. M-maybe.
DCFS and a judge will decide that.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.758
But in the meantime,
don't say anything to Rusty

06:22.792 --> 06:25.194
until we absolutely confirm
the woman's identity.

06:25.228 --> 06:28.831
If Reno police calls back,
ask them to hold for me, please.

06:28.865 --> 06:30.600
Detective Sanchez,

06:30.634 --> 06:34.704
will you join me with miss,
um, with Dr. Nolan?

06:36.240 --> 06:40.777
You did get a warrant
to search that purse?

06:40.811 --> 06:44.814
Come on.
You think I'm new at this?

06:47.918 --> 06:50.654
Hey, funny guy.
You sing and dance, too?

06:56.160 --> 06:58.761
How are you feeling, Doctor?

06:58.796 --> 07:01.030
My head...
I feel groggy.

07:01.065 --> 07:03.566
They probably gave you painkillers.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.067
You had a tough night.

07:05.102 --> 07:08.871
What ...
what happened to me?

07:08.906 --> 07:11.908
Why don't you tell us the
last thing you remember?

07:11.942 --> 07:16.145
I left the restaurant and ...

07:16.180 --> 07:18.548
Um...

07:18.583 --> 07:21.552
I left the restaurant and then...

07:21.586 --> 07:23.787
I don't know. Um...

07:24.622 --> 07:26.223
What happened?

07:26.258 --> 07:28.859
Around 11:00 last night,
you were in a car accident.

07:28.894 --> 07:31.262
Oh, my god.

07:32.931 --> 07:34.231
Am I in trouble or something?

07:34.265 --> 07:38.036
This is just for our notes, Doctor.
The police are here to protect you.

07:38.070 --> 07:39.337
You say you were at a restaurant.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.339
- Were you having dinner?
- Yes. Dinner.

07:41.373 --> 07:47.078
- What restaurant?
- Abby's or Aaron's.

07:47.112 --> 07:48.579
Something like that near downtown.

07:48.614 --> 07:55.854
- Um...
- I paid for the valet and then...

07:55.889 --> 07:59.258
You don't remember getting
into your car? Driving away?

07:59.292 --> 08:01.626
No.

08:01.661 --> 08:05.731
Everything goes black
after the valet. Oh, god.

08:05.765 --> 08:08.901
Well, you're all right now.
That's all that's important.

08:08.935 --> 08:10.603
Well, instead of
thinking about the crash,

08:10.638 --> 08:12.372
see if you can remember what
you had for dinner last night.

08:12.406 --> 08:14.374
What I had for dinner? Why?

08:14.408 --> 08:16.776
Small memories can trigger big ones.

08:16.810 --> 08:18.945
You remember how your food smelled,

08:18.980 --> 08:20.914
or how your drink tasted, and
before you know it, ma'am ...

08:20.948 --> 08:22.282
Leslie, don't answer any more questions.

08:22.316 --> 08:23.850
What? Who are you?
What's going on?

08:23.884 --> 08:27.186
- Tom?
- Les, this is James Corbett.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.254
- He's a lawyer friend of mine from the club.
- A lawyer. Why? What for?

08:29.289 --> 08:30.956
What?
You didn't tell her what happened?

08:30.990 --> 08:34.126
- She's not under arrest.
- Arrest for what?

08:34.159 --> 08:36.962
Evereone out! I'll see you
out in the hallway in a minute.

08:36.996 --> 08:38.964
Tom, arrest for what?

08:41.333 --> 08:44.736
I just heard the blood they
drew for the B.A.C. is no good.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.673
- What?  - They put it in the
wrong vial, if you can believe it.

08:47.707 --> 08:49.274
And the crash was seven hours ago.

08:49.308 --> 08:51.876
Have them repeat it anyway.
I want a tox screen, too.

08:51.911 --> 08:54.179
Get someone over to the
restaurant where she had dinner.

08:54.214 --> 08:56.348
Let's try and find out
what else was in her system.

08:56.383 --> 08:58.017
<i> Morning, Captain.</i>

08:58.051 --> 08:59.952
I just spoke to the lab.
Shame about the blood test.

08:59.986 --> 09:01.720
DDA Michaels, glad you could make it.

09:01.755 --> 09:03.609
Has anyone
questioned the suspect?

09:03.776 --> 09:06.125
We didn't get very far.
Her lawyer kicked us out.

09:06.159 --> 09:07.793
Claims she doesn't remember anything.

09:07.827 --> 09:11.130
Like I said, neuropsych-whatever.
She'd know how to fake amnesia.

09:11.164 --> 09:12.765
You're holding my
client in your custody,

09:12.799 --> 09:14.099
and you didn't even mirandize her?

09:14.133 --> 09:16.301
No. No.
The hospital is holding her, not us.

09:16.336 --> 09:18.370
Your client's free to walk
out whenever she'd like.

09:18.404 --> 09:20.205
Then why is a patrol
officer guarding her room?

09:20.239 --> 09:22.775
Well, she killed three people
and injured nine others,

09:22.809 --> 09:25.110
several of whom are being
treated on this floor, sir.

09:25.145 --> 09:28.080
Dr. Nolan's already been attacked once.
We want her protected.

09:28.115 --> 09:29.415
So thoughtful.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.450
Mr. Corbett, we have
video of your client

09:31.485 --> 09:33.920
stumbling out of her car
moments after the crash.

09:33.954 --> 09:36.089
She was disoriented by the impact.

09:36.123 --> 09:39.426
There were no skid marks at the scene.
She never even made an effort to stop.

09:39.461 --> 09:42.696
So clearly she was
disoriented before the impact.

09:42.730 --> 09:44.798
Have you got
a blood-alcohol content yet?

09:44.833 --> 09:46.233
They're working on it.

09:46.268 --> 09:47.468
There's no way she was
drunk. I was with her.

09:47.502 --> 09:50.337
- She had one cocktail.
- Tom, please.

09:50.371 --> 09:51.939
The results of the
B.A.C. will be negligible.

09:51.973 --> 09:53.407
Dr. Nolan suffers from
a medical condition,

09:53.441 --> 09:56.241
which was responsible for the accident.

09:56.410 --> 09:59.045
- You don't say.
- Excuse me. Who are you?

09:59.079 --> 10:01.815
Tom Ross.
Leslie's my girlfriend.

10:01.849 --> 10:03.983
Tom, how would you feel
about coming downtown with us,

10:04.018 --> 10:05.718
help us fill in the gaps in the story?

10:05.753 --> 10:07.253
I'm afraid that won't be happening.

10:07.288 --> 10:09.322
It's fine, James.
She's got nothing to hide.

10:09.357 --> 10:11.892
I want to go.
Later this morning, though, okay?

10:11.926 --> 10:13.360
Mm.

10:22.903 --> 10:25.872
Uh, Captain Raydor.

10:25.906 --> 10:29.442
What?
Are you're sure it's her?

10:29.477 --> 10:32.879
Put her on.
Hello.

10:32.913 --> 10:36.249
Yes.
I'm with him right now.

10:36.283 --> 10:39.052
One moment.

10:43.491 --> 10:46.960
Rusty.
Your mother's on the phone.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.995
What?

10:56.037 --> 11:00.407
Mom?
Is it really you?

11:03.305 --> 11:06.236
Reno P.D. found Sharon Beck in a rundown

11:06.237 --> 11:10.159
motel room off the interstate.
Now, she's agreed to come to L.A.

11:10.193 --> 11:15.064
and resume her role as Rusty's mother
as long as we wire her $500 in cash.

11:16.666 --> 11:20.168
Hold on. Hold on. I've got
s-s-seventy...  $73.

11:20.203 --> 11:24.638
She can have it all if it means I
don't have to babysit him anymore.

11:27.910 --> 11:32.714
$500 for a bus trip from Reno?
It's little steep, is it not?

11:32.749 --> 11:34.483
We're paying for her bus fare

11:34.517 --> 11:37.152
plus $400 her loser boyfriend,
Gary, says she owes him.

11:37.186 --> 11:39.688
Hey, look, we don't have
a warrant for her arrest,

11:39.722 --> 11:40.856
so it's this or nothing.

11:40.890 --> 11:43.526
- Please.
- Ohh.

11:52.769 --> 11:55.838
- I don't give money to my own kids.
- Cough it up.

12:08.752 --> 12:12.221
- So, when will she be here?
- Around 8:00 tonight.

12:12.256 --> 12:15.992
A-and why's she taking the bus?
I mean, doesn't Reno have an airport?

12:16.026 --> 12:18.827
Well, the city has to approve
travel like that beforehand,

12:18.862 --> 12:22.297
and a one-way, same-day plane
fare from Reno is very expensive.

12:22.332 --> 12:25.901
So everyone here is putting
in to buy a bus ticket.

12:25.936 --> 12:27.208
Right. Right. I gue...

12:27.396 --> 12:29.872
I guess I just didn't
realize it was so complicated.

12:29.907 --> 12:32.608
- Everyone put money in?
- That's right.

12:32.643 --> 12:36.245
Well, I'll, uh ...  we'll be
sure to pay everyone back

12:36.279 --> 12:39.815
- just as soon as we can.
- Don't worry about it.

12:39.849 --> 12:44.686
So, how did your mom sound on the phone?

12:44.720 --> 12:48.823
Happy.
Glad to hear my voice.

12:48.858 --> 12:51.960
I-I-I knew Gary had
forced her to leave.

12:51.995 --> 12:54.963
And, you know, she only went
with him because she was afraid

12:54.998 --> 12:57.065
that he would, like, go
off on me or something.

12:57.099 --> 12:59.600
But now ...  now she's
getting away from him,

12:59.635 --> 13:02.837
and it'll be back to being just us.

13:02.871 --> 13:05.857
Listen.
Um, I want to be perfectly clear

13:05.858 --> 13:08.843
with you about something,
okay, Rusty?

13:08.877 --> 13:11.111
You can spend time with
your mother tonight.

13:11.146 --> 13:15.049
Lieutenant Flynn has volunteered
to take the two of you out to dinner,

13:15.083 --> 13:19.653
but I cannot release you
into her custody right away.

13:19.688 --> 13:23.324
Well, uh, look.
She never dumped me anywhere before.

13:23.358 --> 13:24.792
Mm-hmm.

13:24.826 --> 13:26.727
People ...
people have bad days.

13:26.761 --> 13:30.197
That may be true. But there
are child-endangerment issues...

13:30.232 --> 13:32.166
I-I-I just told you that
Gary forced her to ...

13:32.200 --> 13:34.702
...giving custody again will
be up to the judge, Rusty.

13:34.736 --> 13:36.270
Will ... will I be
able to see her at all?

13:36.305 --> 13:38.072
You'll have supervised
visitation until the judge ...

13:38.107 --> 13:41.209
God! I mean, really?
More rules?

13:41.243 --> 13:44.145
They're not rules.
They're laws.

13:45.381 --> 13:48.783
We found your mother, Rusty.

13:48.818 --> 13:51.019
Concentrate on the positive.

13:51.054 --> 13:55.290
Okay.

13:55.325 --> 14:00.096
Captain... Sharon. 

14:00.130 --> 14:01.864
Thank you.

14:01.898 --> 14:06.136
I'm very grateful, and I want to
make this up to you. And I will.

14:06.170 --> 14:09.039
You don't have to
make anything up to me.

14:09.073 --> 14:11.808
I was perfectly happy to help you out.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.845
Mm.

14:14.879 --> 14:16.981
I guess I don't have to worry

14:17.015 --> 14:20.317
about filling out these
school forms anymore, huh?

14:20.351 --> 14:21.184
I guess not.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.954
Suspect's boyfriend is here, Captain.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.390
Okay. Thank you.

14:29.425 --> 14:31.694
All right.

14:41.104 --> 14:43.739
Dr. Nolan sent a text
last night at 10:32,

14:43.773 --> 14:47.008
about a half-hour before the crash.
It's to a Ralph Tolson.

14:47.043 --> 14:49.911
It says: "Running late.
Sorry. I'm on my way."

14:49.946 --> 14:51.813
Any information on him in her contacts?

14:51.847 --> 14:53.448
Just Tolson's name and phone number.

14:53.482 --> 14:55.784
There's a couple texts
that go back a couple weeks.

14:55.818 --> 14:57.319
Sounds pretty friendly.

14:57.353 --> 14:59.120
Uh, talks about getting together
for drinks, stuff like that.

14:59.155 --> 15:02.357
I got the dinner bill the
suspect's boyfriend signed for last night.

15:02.392 --> 15:04.226
There's no dinner on it, though.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.795
All they had were drinks ...
six of 'em.

15:06.829 --> 15:08.830
Didn't the boyfriend say
that she only had one?

15:08.865 --> 15:10.899
Yeah, well the bartender
said they were ordering

15:10.933 --> 15:14.169
- two at a time, so that doesn't fly.
- They closed out the bill at 10:14,

15:14.203 --> 15:16.471
almost 50 minutes before
she drove into the wall.

15:16.506 --> 15:20.009
Yeah, and it's only 15 minutes by car
from the restaurant to the crash site.

15:20.043 --> 15:23.245
<i>So what did she
do with that extra half-hour?</i>

15:23.280 --> 15:24.747
I-I don't know.

15:26.016 --> 15:27.750
The valet was a little backed up.

15:27.785 --> 15:29.752
They brought my car
around first, so I left.

15:29.786 --> 15:32.155
Who said chivalry was dead?

15:32.189 --> 15:34.424
Dr. Nolan was okay to drive?

15:34.458 --> 15:36.926
Absolutely. I told you,
she only had one drink.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.262
- And how many did you have, sir?
- One or two, I guess.

15:39.296 --> 15:41.764
Your bill says six.

15:43.045 --> 15:46.302
Maybe I ordered her another one.
I... I don't remember it.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.237
A-and these other two, they ...

15:48.272 --> 15:50.039
they were for the couple
sitting next to us.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.842
Oh, I see. Uh, by any chance,
do you remember their names?

15:52.877 --> 15:54.361
No. We joked a bit,

15:54.362 --> 15:57.080
- so I bought 'em a round.
- Amnesia must be going around.

15:57.114 --> 15:59.148
I'm telling you, I know how this looks,

15:59.183 --> 16:01.116
but Leslie wasn't drunk when I left.

16:01.151 --> 16:04.487
And yet she drove her car
into a crowd of people.

16:04.521 --> 16:07.890
- What about drugs?
- What? What about 'em?

16:07.924 --> 16:10.092
Lots of Doctors self-medicate.

16:10.126 --> 16:13.329
Maybe Leslie was, uh, using
something to help her sleep.

16:13.363 --> 16:16.165
No. No.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.369
No, h-h-her lawyer
said she had a T.I.A.

16:19.403 --> 16:20.937
It's a ...
it's a medical thing.

16:20.971 --> 16:22.505
And her lawyer would know this how?

16:22.539 --> 16:27.343
Is he an attorney and a Doctor?
Has he conducted medical exams?

16:28.946 --> 16:32.115
T.I.A. ... It means
"transient ischemic attack."

16:32.149 --> 16:35.018
Temporary loss of blood
flow in part of the brain.

16:35.052 --> 16:36.419
I'll check with the hospital.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.954
<i>Okay, let's forget about this.
Why don't you tell us about Leslie?</i>

16:37.988 --> 16:41.057
Uh, how long have you two been together?

16:41.092 --> 16:44.427
Six years. We ...
we were undergrads at USC.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.430
- Moved in together after college.
- You go into medicine, too?

16:47.465 --> 16:50.934
No.
No, I, uh, I play golf.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.103
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.340
Came in second in the NCAA once.
Did good in the amateur.

16:56.374 --> 16:58.476
Just working as an
assistant pro at Westside now

16:58.510 --> 16:59.977
until I qualify for the tour.

17:00.011 --> 17:02.479
We ...  we put a lot
on hold, you know,

17:02.514 --> 17:04.848
to get Leslie through
med school. Man.

17:04.883 --> 17:08.185
The two of you left separately
last night. Why was that?

17:08.219 --> 17:11.288
We got Leslie an apartment
closer to the hospital

17:11.321 --> 17:12.489
since her residency
starts this week ...

17:12.523 --> 17:14.223
Just a place she can grab a nap.

17:14.259 --> 17:16.260
Or sleep off a bender
without him knowing about it.

17:16.294 --> 17:18.595
<i>Is that where she was going last night?</i>

17:18.630 --> 17:21.531
<i>Uh...
Yeah.</i>

17:21.566 --> 17:23.933
- Why?
- Do you know who Ralph Tolson is?

17:23.968 --> 17:27.837
Tolson?
Dr. Tolson?

17:27.871 --> 17:30.240
That's ...  that's, uh,
that's Leslie's new boss.

17:30.274 --> 17:33.042
He's ...  he's the, uh ...
what do you call him...?

17:33.076 --> 17:35.845
<i>The attending physician
i-i-i-in her department.</i>

17:35.879 --> 17:39.181
I'll run a background check on him
and have Dr. Tolson pay us a visit.

17:39.216 --> 17:41.117
<i>Why? What does
he have to do with this?</i>

17:41.151 --> 17:42.886
<i>Oh, probably nothing.</i>

17:42.920 --> 17:46.522
We found a text that Leslie
sent to Dr. Tolson last night,

17:46.557 --> 17:49.893
shortly after you left
her at the valet stand.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.196
What did it say?

17:53.230 --> 17:55.531
on: "Running late.
Sorry. On my way now."

17:55.566 --> 17:58.535
I-I'm not a big texter.
It's the first time I'm seeing it.

17:58.569 --> 18:00.570
And where was she
meeting you, Dr. Tolson?

18:00.605 --> 18:02.139
She wasn't meeting me.

18:02.173 --> 18:03.573
It was a reception for
all the new residents ...

18:03.608 --> 18:05.175
A place called Ginger.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.610
And do you recall if she
ever made it to Ginger?

18:07.644 --> 18:09.445
No. But there was
a lot of people there.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.314
Um, honestly, I don't
know her very well.

18:11.348 --> 18:13.516
I-I'm not even sure I could
pick her out in a crowd.

18:13.550 --> 18:17.053
- But she has your cell number, sir.
- All my residents do.

18:17.087 --> 18:19.589
Evidently, you don't
know how a hospital works.

18:20.358 --> 18:22.025
Look, whoever called me down here

18:22.059 --> 18:23.560
could've asked me these
questions over the phone.

18:23.595 --> 18:26.597
Evidently, you don't know
how a police department works.

18:26.631 --> 18:28.132
Detective?

18:28.166 --> 18:30.534
Sir, these are a series
of texted conversations

18:30.569 --> 18:33.604
between you and Leslie Nolan
going back several weeks.

18:33.639 --> 18:35.139
Now, it looks like you
went a little beyond

18:35.174 --> 18:39.110
the usual teacher-student
relationship, sir.

18:40.412 --> 18:45.382
Uh, she asked me about housing.
She wanted a place near the hospital.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.318
I helped her find one.
That's not really unusual, Detective.

18:48.352 --> 18:49.920
Captain, would you like
me to explain this part?

18:49.954 --> 18:51.588
I handled investigations
like this when I ...

18:51.622 --> 18:53.022
That's all right.
I've got it. Thank you.

18:53.057 --> 18:54.357
- Okay.
- Sanchez: So ... um ...

18:54.391 --> 18:56.926
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.996
Sir, when you helped
Dr. Nolan find this apartment,

19:01.030 --> 19:03.165
was she with her boyfriend?

19:04.467 --> 19:08.937
I, uh... oh, I didn't know
Dr. Nolan had a boyfriend.

19:09.539 --> 19:15.344
Dr. Tolson, what does the name
Katherine Alvarez mean to you?

19:17.747 --> 19:20.448
- What is this?
- Or Monica Ward?

19:20.483 --> 19:23.384
- Do you remember her?
- They have nothing to do with this.

19:23.419 --> 19:25.319
They were residents of yours as well,

19:25.353 --> 19:27.555
and they both filed
sexual-harassment claims against you

19:27.589 --> 19:29.590
- when they were working...
- We're done here.

19:29.624 --> 19:32.392
If you have any more
questions, consult my lawyer.

19:37.331 --> 19:40.566
All right, Leslie and Tom
closed their bar tab at 10:14 pm.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.504
18 minutes later, the suspect texted
Dr. Tolson to say she was on her way.

19:44.538 --> 19:47.406
At this point, there's 28
minutes until the crash.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.209
She could've driven east to
Ginger for a drink with Tolson.

19:50.243 --> 19:51.510
Or?

19:51.545 --> 19:55.481
Or she left Aaron's, got lost downtown,
and drove around until she crashed.

19:55.516 --> 19:58.117
I'll find the other
residents who were at Ginger,

19:58.152 --> 19:59.686
see if Dr. Nolan made it there or not.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.123
Uh, pardon me, Lieutenant.
But how long will that take?

20:03.157 --> 20:06.026
Don't worry, Buzz. I'll be back
in time to pick up Rusty's mom.

20:07.361 --> 20:09.329
Why don't we try getting
the suspect's boyfriend ...

20:09.363 --> 20:10.731
that dumb golfer dude ...

20:10.765 --> 20:13.099
to admit that she had
more than one drink?

20:13.134 --> 20:15.168
- He is her only alibi.
- Will he give her up?

20:15.202 --> 20:17.470
It won't be pretty.
But, yeah, we can manage it.

20:17.504 --> 20:19.572
I have the suspect's medical records.

20:19.606 --> 20:22.442
She's young, she's healthy,
no history of high blood pressure,

20:22.476 --> 20:25.711
so the lawyer's claim that she
suffered a T.I.A. Is doubtful, Captain.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.967
- What about a seizure?
- Well, normally you'd look

20:27.968 --> 20:31.184
for a spike in her prolactin levels,
and this is terribly interesting ...

20:31.218 --> 20:33.386
- Tao!
- No seizure.

20:33.420 --> 20:36.623
So no medical condition.

20:36.657 --> 20:39.292
Which brings us back
to where we started.

20:39.326 --> 20:40.560
Yeah, we have a suspect
who killed three people

20:40.594 --> 20:42.061
while under the influence.

20:42.095 --> 20:44.497
And we still have no way to prove it.

20:54.683 --> 20:56.151
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

20:56.185 --> 20:58.653
<i>Are you drunk
or something, lady? Hey!</i>

20:58.687 --> 21:01.122
<i>Hey! Hey, this bitch
is drunk off her ass!</i>

21:01.157 --> 21:03.625
<i>Hey, that's my brother
on the ground over there!</i>

21:03.659 --> 21:05.226
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?!</i>

21:06.628 --> 21:08.729
I know this is difficult for you, Tom.

21:08.763 --> 21:11.732
- She didn't do anything wrong.
- But you see our dilemma.

21:11.766 --> 21:14.001
We need a reason
Leslie ran off the road.

21:14.036 --> 21:17.304
And your mention of that T.I.A.,
well, that just won't do the trick.

21:17.339 --> 21:21.042
- You paid for six drinks last night.
- I told you this morning,

21:21.076 --> 21:23.611
if I ordered her a second
drink, she hardly touched it.

21:23.646 --> 21:25.547
And two of those were for
the couple sitting next to us.

21:25.581 --> 21:28.450
- A couple you can't name.
- So you think I'm lying?

21:28.484 --> 21:31.352
No, I think this looks like
someone who had three stiff drinks.

21:31.386 --> 21:33.321
<i>And that's what that receipt implies.</i>

21:33.355 --> 21:35.623
Lieutenant Flynn still isn't back.

21:35.657 --> 21:37.658
He will be. He has
a few people to track down.

21:37.693 --> 21:39.561
You'll make your
mother's bus. I promise.

21:39.595 --> 21:42.697
- Well, yeah, but, i-if he's late ...
- I'm calling Lieutenant Flynn right now.

21:42.731 --> 21:45.165
You wibe there when
your mother arrives.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.434
<i>Tom, my friend, your
girl was bombed. It's obvious.</i>

21:47.469 --> 21:50.104
I've told you over and over now.
That didn't happen.

21:50.138 --> 21:51.606
Sir.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.610
Maybe she really did have
more drinks with Tolson.

21:56.712 --> 21:59.381
Tolson?
What? Why would she ...

21:59.415 --> 22:01.082
She didn't mention to you

22:01.117 --> 22:04.219
that she might stop by
at a reception last night?

22:04.253 --> 22:07.122
- What reception?
- At Ginger for the new residents

22:07.156 --> 22:09.257
and her new best friend, Dr. Tolson.

22:09.292 --> 22:12.595
Oh, I can't believe that
she didn't tell you that.

22:12.629 --> 22:16.165
Makes me wonder what
else you don't know.

22:16.199 --> 22:18.501
<i>Look. Let me fill you in.</i>

22:18.535 --> 22:21.771
Leslie is sneaking around behind
your back with another guy.

22:21.805 --> 22:23.439
No, she is not sneaking ...

22:23.473 --> 22:25.775
Well, you're going out on
a limb for your girlfriend,

22:25.809 --> 22:27.777
and she's going out with her new boss.

22:27.811 --> 22:31.281
- What?
- Oh, my.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.649
<i>What, do you really think that
she got that second apartment</i>

22:32.684 --> 22:36.251
so that she would have
a place to crash?

22:38.556 --> 22:44.527
Your girlfriend is cheating on you, Tom.
Why are you protecting her?

22:44.562 --> 22:48.765
Are you ...
are you sure about this?

22:48.799 --> 22:53.269
Oh, we can't show you the
evidence, but, yes. We're very sure.

22:57.541 --> 23:02.411
I didn't want to get her
in trouble, okay? But she...

23:05.482 --> 23:09.218
You know,
she took samples sometimes.

23:09.252 --> 23:12.821
From the hospital.

23:12.855 --> 23:18.861
No! You must have the
tox screen I ordered by now.

23:18.895 --> 23:22.798
No! You cannot call me back!
I'm the police!

23:22.832 --> 23:25.567
Fine. I'll hold.

23:28.838 --> 23:32.725
It'd be a hell of a thing if drugs
show up in her blood work. I just found

23:32.726 --> 23:36.612
out all the new residents had a mandatory
drug test on the books for this morning.

23:36.646 --> 23:38.814
Brandon Rios, one of
the critically injured ...

23:38.848 --> 23:42.884
he didn't make it. He passed away
about 15 minutes ago, Captain.

23:42.919 --> 23:46.554
Rios was 24, assistant
manager at his family's restaurant.

23:46.589 --> 23:48.723
He graduated CSUN last year.

23:48.757 --> 23:51.326
I ran backgrounds on
everyone injured or killed.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.761
I just wanted to make sure Dr. Nolan

23:52.795 --> 23:55.330
didn't have a reason to
bulldoze that crowd on purpose. {*vid.cut*}

23:55.600 --> 23:59.571
- Lieutenant, anything new from the hospital?
- No. Just some catchy hold music.

24:00.975 --> 24:02.743
Any news?

24:02.777 --> 24:06.213
Rusty's mom just called from
a pay phone in Bakersfield.

24:06.247 --> 24:09.450
She's changing buses on her way to L.A.

24:09.485 --> 24:12.821
Hey, uh, how long do we have to
wait before meeting this judge?

24:12.855 --> 24:14.923
Um, I don't know.
A week, maybe.

24:14.957 --> 24:17.593
But let's take it one
step at a time, okay?

24:17.627 --> 24:19.896
- Captain.
- Excuse me.

24:24.335 --> 24:29.155
Okay, the second blood-alcohol can't
tell us anything, but the tox screen

24:29.156 --> 24:33.976
says that Dr. Nolan had high levels
of Valium and Ambien in her system.

24:34.011 --> 24:35.879
- How high?
- More than the blood work shows

24:35.913 --> 24:38.615
because these two drugs
together create a ...

24:38.649 --> 24:42.852
Well, it's a thing called, uh...
I've got it here. Uh...

24:42.887 --> 24:44.554
Synergistic amplification.

24:44.589 --> 24:47.758
By combining the two drugs,
you increase the potency of each.

24:47.792 --> 24:51.495
Thank you.
In english, she was extra high.

24:51.530 --> 24:53.364
It's also easy for Doctors
to get their own meds.

24:53.398 --> 24:55.232
I'll get a warrant, ask
the state medical board

24:55.266 --> 24:56.867
to let us review all the prescriptions

24:56.902 --> 24:59.337
associated with Dr. Nolan's
reference number.

24:59.371 --> 25:02.873
And, uh, we'll search her apartments.
See if the drugs are there.

25:04.576 --> 25:05.809
Uh, Captain.

25:07.912 --> 25:12.816
Um, y-you know, um, Flynn can
pick up Rusty's mother and ...

25:12.850 --> 25:15.585
and take them to dinner
and get her settled.

25:15.619 --> 25:17.253
It's ...
it's no big deal.

25:17.287 --> 25:22.625
But if ...  if you would like
to go with Rusty yourself...

25:22.660 --> 25:29.632
I would. But I don't think his mother
would appreciate my being there,

25:29.666 --> 25:33.502
and I want it to be as
easy for Rusty as possible.

25:34.671 --> 25:36.838
Thank you, though.

25:44.047 --> 25:46.514
<i> Captain, I think we have her.</i>

25:48.317 --> 25:51.986
Copies of Leslie Nolan's prescriptions
for the last four months ...

25:52.021 --> 25:54.522
A total of 127 of them,

25:54.556 --> 25:55.756
all phoned in to pharmacies
on the Westside and ...

25:55.791 --> 25:59.560
This is very telling ...
every one of them paid for in cash.

25:59.594 --> 26:02.862
Oh, my god.
This is the smoking gun.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.867
These prescriptions aren't for Leslie.

26:07.902 --> 26:09.303
And how do you know the people they are

26:09.304 --> 26:10.704
made out to aren't patients of hers?

26:10.738 --> 26:14.508
Hospital residents and interns
rarely prescribe, and not that much.

26:14.542 --> 26:17.844
And look at the drugs.
Nothing but Ambien, Valium, and Vicodin.

26:17.879 --> 26:19.380
But none of that was in her purse,

26:19.414 --> 26:21.081
and both the apartments
you searched were clean.

26:21.116 --> 26:25.886
- If she has the stuff, where is it?
- Why don't we ask her?

26:25.920 --> 26:29.056
You'll notice that
some of the drugs ...

26:29.090 --> 26:31.625
the Valium and Ambien, anyway ...

26:31.659 --> 26:35.329
show up in your tox
screen from last night.

26:35.363 --> 26:38.065
In my tox screen?

26:38.100 --> 26:40.968
- Wait. This is my blood work?
- It is.

26:41.003 --> 26:44.339
Leslie, I strongly advise
you, as your lawyer...

26:44.374 --> 26:46.475
- Oh, my god.
- ...not to say another word.

26:46.509 --> 26:47.943
Mr. Corbett, if I show a jury

26:47.977 --> 26:49.712
the footage of your client
stumbling from her car

26:49.746 --> 26:52.682
moments after killing now four people,
and then I prove to them

26:52.716 --> 26:54.517
that she wrote a pile
of illegal prescriptions

26:54.551 --> 26:56.753
and that she was driving under
the influence of those drugs

26:56.787 --> 26:58.388
at the time of the accident ...

26:58.422 --> 27:03.251
Please, Mr. Corbett.
There ...

27:03.286 --> 27:05.362
there are so many people dead.

27:05.396 --> 27:09.599
So much...
Oh, my god.

27:09.634 --> 27:12.102
I should tell them
what I think happened.

27:12.136 --> 27:15.672
Please.
Let me explain.

27:24.649 --> 27:26.383
Just so you know,

27:26.417 --> 27:29.052
I made arrangements for her
to stay at a decent hotel.

27:29.086 --> 27:29.919
Great.

27:31.088 --> 27:32.789
Uh, wait. The...
the hotel.

27:32.823 --> 27:34.925
It won't have a minibar, will it?

27:37.528 --> 27:38.895
She doesn't like minibars.

27:41.666 --> 27:46.503
Right. No minibar.
I'll make sure.

27:51.042 --> 27:54.111
You know, if you want,
we can just skip dinner altogether

27:54.145 --> 27:57.948
- and drop her right off at the ...
- No. No, no, no. I ...

27:57.983 --> 28:00.154
I just don't want you to judge her.

28:01.753 --> 28:03.887
I-I-I don't want her to feel
like people are down on her.

28:03.921 --> 28:06.456
I need her to see that she made
the right choice by coming back,

28:06.490 --> 28:11.862
so, if you could just smile,
maybe, and um...

28:11.896 --> 28:14.031
uh, be happy for her.

28:14.065 --> 28:16.533
I mean, I really just need
you to say nice things.

28:19.137 --> 28:21.038
You bet. No problem.

28:22.774 --> 28:24.107
Oh, here we go.

29:06.754 --> 29:08.121
Hold on.

29:09.657 --> 29:12.960
Excuse me.
Have you seen this woman?

29:12.994 --> 29:14.695
She was supposed to be on your bus.

29:14.729 --> 29:18.632
Got off in Bakersfield, I think.
Yeah, some guy picked her up.

29:18.666 --> 29:20.000
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

29:20.035 --> 29:22.103
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:28.577 --> 29:31.880
<i>Rusty?</i>

29:31.914 --> 29:34.049
I think I should be in there.

29:34.083 --> 29:36.685
There are a lot of things
I need to ask her. Man.

29:36.719 --> 29:38.887
Well, first, the D.A.
and her attorney have to get

29:38.922 --> 29:40.922
their questions answered,
videotape her statement,

29:40.957 --> 29:42.190
and make a deal, sir.

29:42.225 --> 29:45.494
A deal? What deal?
Is she going to jail?

29:45.528 --> 29:48.664
This is all some
kind of mistake. I know it.

29:48.698 --> 29:51.878
Look, Mr. Ross, there was
one mistake, and it was ours,

29:51.947 --> 29:54.937
and I'd like to apologize for it.

29:54.972 --> 29:57.707
We were wrong about
Dr. Tolson and your girlfriend.

29:57.741 --> 29:59.876
There was nothing going on between them.

29:59.911 --> 30:01.645
Really?

30:02.680 --> 30:05.649
Oh, my god.
That is such a huge load off my mind.

30:05.684 --> 30:07.885
I mean, I-I didn't
believe it, but... thanks.

30:12.658 --> 30:14.558
James, what's going on?

30:14.593 --> 30:17.561
D.A.'s offering four
counts of manslaughter.

30:17.596 --> 30:18.662
Manslaughter?!

30:18.697 --> 30:21.198
Mr. Corbett's not permitted
to discuss the specifics of the deal.

30:21.233 --> 30:22.766
- Can Leslie?
- She could.

30:22.801 --> 30:25.936
And if you really care about her, you'll
convince her to take our offer, sir.

30:25.971 --> 30:28.639
We'll see.

30:31.910 --> 30:34.178
- Tom!
- Why are you considering a deal?

30:34.213 --> 30:36.981
- You didn't do anything wrong!
- A jury might disagree.

30:37.015 --> 30:38.415
Would you excuse us, please?

30:38.450 --> 30:41.085
Absolutely.
I'm sorry, Doctor.

30:56.234 --> 30:58.202
Buzz, did you get the
earwig up and running?

30:58.236 --> 30:59.770
I did, but talk softly.

30:59.805 --> 31:01.138
I don't know if this plan
of yours is gonna work.

31:01.173 --> 31:03.707
Would you like to
suggest an alternative?

31:05.143 --> 31:09.781
<i>- Are they talking about jail time?
- 20 years, Tom.</i>

31:09.815 --> 31:15.588
- 20 years? Based on what?
- Look at these.

31:15.622 --> 31:17.289
They tracked my D.E.A. number

31:17.324 --> 31:20.593
and found all these
prescriptions associated with it.

31:20.628 --> 31:23.364
And if they find even one of
these pills in either of our

31:23.365 --> 31:26.100
apartments, I could go to
jail for the rest of my life.

31:27.936 --> 31:29.670
That's why Corbett wants
me to take the deal.

31:29.705 --> 31:32.173
<i>And if they don't find the drugs?</i>

31:32.207 --> 31:35.043
<i>The charges could get reduced
to involuntary manslaughter,</i>

31:35.077 --> 31:37.713
<i>and I'd do two years,
but it's a huge risk.</i>

31:39.115 --> 31:41.583
<i>Tom, I'm so scared.</i>

31:41.617 --> 31:45.921
I don't think that I can
get through this without you.

31:45.956 --> 31:50.092
Are you ... are you really
gonna stick with me on this?

31:50.126 --> 31:52.861
So, now you're worried
about me sticking with you,

31:52.896 --> 31:54.963
and last month you were
worried I was holding you back.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.932
<i>No, no. I was wrong.
I was very wrong.</i>

31:56.966 --> 32:00.002
Oh, so there was trouble in paradise.

32:00.036 --> 32:02.104
Dr. Nolan claims she
started a soft breakup

32:02.138 --> 32:05.007
two weeks ago with her boyfriend.
Hence the new apartment.

32:05.041 --> 32:08.143
You were the one person in
my life that I could count on.

32:08.177 --> 32:13.248
And this whole terrible
nightmare has made me realize

32:13.283 --> 32:17.398
just how stupid
I was to push you away.

32:17.821 --> 32:22.924
I love you, Tom.
And I need you to be here for me.

32:26.663 --> 32:27.996
Don't take the deal, Les.

32:28.031 --> 32:34.836
- Are you sure? What if they...
- Listen to me. Don't take it, okay?

32:34.870 --> 32:35.804
Okay.

32:43.311 --> 32:45.813
I can make sure they
don't find those drugs.

32:45.847 --> 32:47.281
How?

32:49.150 --> 32:52.052
You remember when you stopped getting me
all those different drug samples

32:52.086 --> 32:53.786
for the problem I was
having with my back?

32:53.821 --> 32:55.322
Yeah.

32:55.356 --> 32:58.125
Well, the pain got so bad that
I-I couldn't manage my swing.

32:58.159 --> 33:02.395
I took your reference number.
I called the prescriptions in myself.

33:02.430 --> 33:04.297
But it w-was just so that ...
that I could get some sleep,

33:04.332 --> 33:07.267
<i>really, while you were figuring
out how much space you needed.</i>

33:10.171 --> 33:13.040
We need the evidence, Doctor.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.375
Okay.

33:15.410 --> 33:19.880
But, um, if the police find those drugs,
they're gonna think that they're mine.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.115
I mean, what if they
search the apartment ...

33:21.149 --> 33:22.349
- No.
- What if ...

33:22.384 --> 33:24.051
No. Everything is in
my locker at the club.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.753
I will go by there the second
I leave here and dump them.

33:26.788 --> 33:29.155
- That's it. You have it.
- Hold on. She's almost there.

33:29.190 --> 33:33.860
<i>Trust me, Leslie.
Those drugs will never be found.</i>

33:33.894 --> 33:36.296
You know what to say, Leslie.

33:39.500 --> 33:43.102
But, Tom.

33:43.137 --> 33:46.906
My blood work shows that
those drugs were in my system.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.876
And I completely blacked out.

33:52.346 --> 33:53.879
Oh, god.

33:56.750 --> 34:00.086
How ... how many
drinks did I really have?

34:02.923 --> 34:04.223
One.

34:04.258 --> 34:07.893
And that one drink, did
you put something in it?

34:11.130 --> 34:12.164
Tom, look at me.

34:13.433 --> 34:15.201
I love you, but if you
were trying to kill me...

34:15.235 --> 34:18.103
Trying to kill you?!
Are you kidding me?

34:18.138 --> 34:21.007
Leslie, I just ...  I just
wanted you back. That's all.

34:21.042 --> 34:23.744
I-I figured that if your
residency didn't work out,

34:23.777 --> 34:26.246
that i-if you failed your drug test,
that you would come back home, and ...

34:26.281 --> 34:27.949
Wait. Wait.
This was about the drug test?

34:27.983 --> 34:30.451
<i>I am so sorry, okay?
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.</i>

34:30.485 --> 34:33.353
I-I just thought, since the
Ambien was time-released...

34:33.353 --> 34:34.788
It isn't time-released...

34:34.822 --> 34:37.757
- ...that you would be home long before ...
- ...if you crush it up! How stupid are you anyway?

34:37.792 --> 34:39.259
- Hey, hey, shh, shh.
- My god, you're an idiot!

34:39.293 --> 34:41.762
Listen to me.
What I did was wrong, okay?

34:41.795 --> 34:43.364
But I only wanted you back.

34:43.398 --> 34:45.399
I ... okay?

34:45.433 --> 34:48.302
- What is it? What's the matter?
- Hello?

34:48.335 --> 34:49.837
<i>Do you have enough?</i>

34:49.871 --> 34:52.039
Yes. You're good.
We got it.

34:52.074 --> 34:56.210
- Who are you talking to?
- You stupid son of a bitch!

34:56.244 --> 34:58.212
You're not just pathetic!
You're a murderer!

34:58.246 --> 35:01.249
- I guess someone should break it up.
- Yes, please.

35:01.283 --> 35:04.318
- You know what this is?
- What did you do?

35:04.353 --> 35:06.120
I recorded your crazy
confession for the police.

35:06.154 --> 35:08.089
- That's what I did.
- You lied to me!

35:14.028 --> 35:15.429
I'm beginning to like Sykes.

35:15.463 --> 35:19.399
<i>What is that anyway?
You ruin my career and then win me back?</i>

35:19.434 --> 35:24.571
How were we gonna support ourselves?
What, on your ability as a pro golfer?

35:24.606 --> 35:26.373
What kind of fantasy
world do you live in?

35:26.407 --> 35:29.076
Oh, and these prescriptions?

35:29.110 --> 35:31.311
They're all written out to
your friends from the club!

35:32.880 --> 35:36.382
What have you done?
Four people are dead because of you!

35:36.417 --> 35:39.853
You made me kill four people!

35:39.887 --> 35:42.822
You made me kill four people...

35:42.856 --> 35:44.891
I want a deal.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.960
You offered her a deal.
Don't I get a deal?!

35:46.994 --> 35:49.062
Oh, sure.
I got a great deal for you.

35:49.096 --> 35:51.131
Northern California.
Nice, state-run facility.

35:51.165 --> 35:53.834
You can work on your swing
for the rest of your life.

35:53.868 --> 35:55.402
All right, get him out of here.

36:01.209 --> 36:02.476
You're all right.

36:02.510 --> 36:06.346
<i>You're all right now.</i>

36:11.653 --> 36:15.522
Lieutenant Flynn, I am so sorry
I was unable to take your call earlier.

36:15.556 --> 36:20.995
We're in ...
What?

36:21.029 --> 36:26.533
What do you mean Rusty ran off?
Ran off where?

36:29.576 --> 36:33.011
Look at those all drugs.
Tom had a pharmacy lookin his locker.

36:33.045 --> 36:36.014
Still doesn't prove pre-meditation.
Best we could do

36:36.048 --> 36:37.482
is get him to agree to
four counts of murder two.

36:37.517 --> 36:39.251
On the bright
side, we got the hospital

36:39.285 --> 36:43.521
to save Dr. Nolan's spot in
the residency pool. Poor kid.

36:43.556 --> 36:45.424
Starting out her career as a
Doctor and kills four people.

36:45.458 --> 36:46.558
That can't be good.

36:46.593 --> 36:49.361
Yeah, how could tom say he loved
her while trying to ruin her life?

36:49.395 --> 36:53.465
Oh, now, now.
So cynical, Amy.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.302
- Weren't you ever stupid in love?
- Not since my 19th birthday.

36:56.336 --> 37:00.514
- What happened on your 19th birthday?
- You'll never know.

37:01.708 --> 37:07.463
- Lieutenant, anything?
- Yeah, we have multiple units

37:07.498 --> 37:09.359
searching the streets
around the bus station.

37:09.459 --> 37:11.900
Sheriff department in West
Hollywood's got his picture.

37:11.934 --> 37:13.568
And everyone we can spare
is out looking for him.

37:13.603 --> 37:15.937
Okay. Okay.

37:15.971 --> 37:19.207
Captain, look, I'm sorry.

37:19.242 --> 37:21.843
I turned my back for one
second, and he was gone. I ...

37:21.877 --> 37:23.811
If I thought for one minute
that he would run away ...

37:23.846 --> 37:26.947
Lieutenant, it's not your fault.
We'll keep looking.

37:26.982 --> 37:28.883
Good night, everyone.

37:34.523 --> 37:36.391
Great work, all around.

37:36.425 --> 37:40.361
Everyone, really great work.

37:45.034 --> 37:48.369
Captain.
I, uh ...

37:48.403 --> 37:52.874
Flynn and I will stay here
tonight till the kid turns up.

37:52.908 --> 37:54.909
And he will.

37:56.612 --> 37:57.612
He'll turn up.

38:42.293 --> 38:45.628
You're home late.

38:52.937 --> 38:55.972
I was wrapping up a case.

38:57.941 --> 38:59.542
Rusty, I'm sorry about your ...

38:59.576 --> 39:01.310
Don't ... don't talk about it.

39:01.344 --> 39:04.146
She lied to me.
I believed her.

39:04.180 --> 39:06.682
- And that'll never happen again.
- I don't honestly think that ...

39:06.717 --> 39:09.552
I-I really don't wanna
talk about it. Please.

39:11.621 --> 39:15.558
Okay. But I have one
question to ask you,

39:15.592 --> 39:17.527
and I need you to answer truthfully.

39:17.561 --> 39:21.797
Why did you run away
from Lieutenant Flynn?

39:24.368 --> 39:26.269
I don't cry in front of people.

39:29.540 --> 39:33.376
And I started to cry.
So I left.

39:36.013 --> 39:37.414
Mm.

39:37.448 --> 39:38.982
How much money exactly did
she steal from everyone?

39:39.016 --> 39:41.484
Don't worry about it.
We can, um ...

39:41.519 --> 39:44.187
we have it covered by,
uh, our bosses.

39:45.389 --> 39:47.624
What's that?

39:47.659 --> 39:51.529
Oh. I was behind on filling
out these forms for school,

39:51.563 --> 39:54.232
and y-you said you
needed them tomorrow.

39:54.266 --> 39:59.137
- You still want them?
- Yes, I do.

40:01.073 --> 40:02.440
Okay.

40:03.643 --> 40:05.143
Rusty.

40:07.079 --> 40:09.380
Your mother is the one
who's losing out here.

40:09.415 --> 40:13.485
Nothing she's done has
a thing to do with you.

40:13.519 --> 40:15.486
I hope you know that.

40:18.490 --> 40:20.591
I thought she loved me.

40:23.562 --> 40:27.065
And letting go of that
is what's hard.

40:27.099 --> 40:31.097
But holding on to someone when
they're gone is even harder.

40:33.539 --> 40:36.441
Thanks for trying to bring her back.

40:54.728 --> 40:58.731
Lieutenant Provenza, thank
you for picking up so quickly.

40:58.765 --> 41:03.268
Um... you can tell
the department to stand down.

41:03.302 --> 41:06.571
When I came in the door,
Rusty was here, so...

41:06.605 --> 41:10.575
Yes. So, I guess he ...
uh, Rusty is home.

41:13.446 --> 41:15.180
Thank you.
