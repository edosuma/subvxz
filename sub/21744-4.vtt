It's 6:30 on election night,
and, as you can see,

00:06.089 --> 00:08.008
the turnout looks to be historic.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.093
The post-work rush has begun in earnest.

00:10.177 --> 00:14.056
Will the blue wall of Michigan, Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania stand tonight?

00:14.139 --> 00:16.934
The smart money says yes,
even though it appears

00:17.017 --> 00:18.644
in early exit polling that turnout

00:18.727 --> 00:20.854
in the more traditionally
Democratic counties,

00:20.938 --> 00:23.857
such as Wayne and Genesee,
seems lower than usual.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.860
One thing that's certainly not
low on either side tonight:

00:26.944 --> 00:28.946
passion. Back to you, Bob.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.032
That was good,
but let's do one more time.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.617
I forgot to mention Saginaw County.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.244
RJ: Honestly, I wouldn't bother.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.955
Bob says he doesn't think he's gonna
use any cutaways or bumpers

00:38.038 --> 00:39.498
-during the election coverage tonight.
-Well, then what the fuck

00:39.581 --> 00:41.333
am I doing here?
Why didn't anyone tell me?

00:41.416 --> 00:42.793
Something wrong, Beverly?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.461

00:48.006 --> 00:50.926
I have to jump the line
and pull the lever for HRC.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.929
Bob asked me to sit in on
the coverage desk with him tonight.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.973

00:56.056 --> 00:58.851

one of those women that needs

01:00.602 --> 01:03.605
to drag down successful women
in order to feel good about herself?

01:34.553 --> 01:36.013

01:36.096 --> 01:39.558
Of course not. That's my point.
I mean, who am I to vote?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.894
I can see me voting
for the Emmys or the Globes,

01:41.977 --> 01:45.147
but I'm not nearly informed
enough to pick our president.

Is she done pretending to be interested
in your liver spot-covered dick yet?

27:43.580 --> 27:46.333
I need to actually do some,
you know, work.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.627

-Yeah, about that.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.838
I'm gonna need you to cut
a minute out of your piece.

27:50.921 --> 27:53.423

dangerous parts of Michigan.

27:53.507 --> 27:56.426

there will only be time for seven.

They want to be distracted from the news.

29:28.477 --> 29:30.604
And someone like you, a black woman?

29:31.188 --> 29:32.272
You have it the worst.

29:32.689 --> 29:35.067
On the one side,
you have people saying, "Diversity hire,

29:35.150 --> 29:37.194
"affirmative action.
She doesn't deserve that."

29:37.277 --> 29:39.905
And then on the other side, they say,
"Well, she's just as good as we are.

29:39.988 --> 29:41.365
"She just got a raw deal."

29:42.282 --> 29:44.284

29:45.494 --> 29:47.621

Knowing the game is rigged
isn't worth shit

Another tough-talking white boy.

30:08.350 --> 30:10.519
The world has become tiny,

30:11.854 --> 30:14.481
which means the fear
in a small town in Michigan

30:14.565 --> 30:18.527
can infect the country,
the world in a few days.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.197
Now, fear, fear isn't like a virus.

30:22.281 --> 30:25.868
When fear finds more hosts,
it gets stronger, scarier.

30:26.410 --> 30:29.204
The tiny fear in one woman
turns into a beast

30:29.288 --> 30:32.875
that swallows the world by the time
it spreads across the country.

30:37.004 --> 30:40.424
Great men and women have been
weaponizing fear forever,

30:40.507 --> 30:41.925
but what all those men had

30:43.385 --> 30:45.304
was a great messenger.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.640
Someone with a pulpit and a microphone.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.560
Someone to give that fear a name.

31:07.075 --> 31:09.328
I was in the army.
I served a tour in Iraq,

31:09.411 --> 31:11.121
came home and graduated
in three from Yale

31:11.205 --> 31:13.582

I have a brown belt in karate,
I have a 135 IQ,

31:16.001 --> 31:17.336
and I'm running for city council.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.422
First of all,

31:20.506 --> 31:22.966
there are no open seats
on the city council.

31:23.300 --> 31:27.429
Second, you're planning on dominating
the world from a city council seat.

31:28.263 --> 31:29.515

31:29.723 --> 31:31.725

anything is possible.

31:43.946 --> 31:46.281
I need you, Beverly.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.016

32:14.059 --> 32:15.602
Tell me what that feels like.

32:20.941 --> 32:22.317
It's not like anger.

32:23.485 --> 32:24.778
Everyone feels that.

32:25.863 --> 32:27.239
It feels like wanting to be

it mattered the most, I froze.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

42:16.537 --> 42:18.038
There's a lot of crazy right now.

42:18.121 --> 42:21.208
I mean, Trump and those dickfaces feel
like they can get away with anything.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.668
This is not normal.

42:23.919 --> 42:26.588

they can get away with anything.

42:27.673 --> 42:28.882
Because they have.

Everything's been handed to them.

and minorities,

42:37.182 --> 42:39.977
