00:01.418 --> 00:04.630
LAYLA: HELPING COOP AND PATIENCE
ON THAT TRACK REALLY FELT GOOD.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.423
THERE'S SOMETHING
SPECIAL THERE,

00:06.423 --> 00:08.467
BUT I GOT MAD ARTISTS LIKE
COOP ALREADY ON MY LABEL.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.636
WHAT I DON'T HAVE IS
SOMEONE LIKE PATIENCE.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.679
JORDAN'S GOT
A GIRL PREGNANT.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.264
SHE'S ABOUT TO HAVE
YOUR CHILD.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.308

BILLY: I KNOW
I HAVE NOT BEEN

00:17.684 --> 00:19.228
THE HUSBAND

00:19.228 --> 00:21.271
GIVE ME ONE
MORE CHANCE.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.439
LET ME MAKE
THIS RIGHT.

OLIVIA: HOOKING UP MADE
THINGS WEIRD BETWEEN US,

00:27.110 --> 00:28.737
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

I NEED THAT MORE THAN
I NEED A BOYFRIEND.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.366
THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR LAST WEEKEND

00:32.366 --> 00:34.117

01:30.299 --> 01:31.717
AND WE FINALLY
WENT FISHING

01:31.717 --> 01:33.343
THAT LAST NIGHT
AT THE CABIN.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.053
DID HE GIVE YOU
HIS LECTURE ABOUT

01:35.053 --> 01:36.346
PRACTICING PATIENCE?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.557
OH, YEAH.
I GOT THE FAMOUS SPEECH.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.143
HOW FISHING AIN'T REALLY
ABOUT FISHING.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.394
YEAH.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.730
HEY, MAYBE THE 3 OF US
CAN GO SOMETIME.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.606
YOU COULD TELL US
SOME MORE STORIES
ABOUT HIM.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.234
YEAH.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.868
HOW'D IT GO?

01:57.868 --> 01:59.161
STILL NO HEADSTONE.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.747
IT'LL BE THERE
REAL SOON, BABY.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.290
MWAH!

02:03.290 --> 02:04.666

02:09.838 --> 02:11.381
HE SAYS YOU HAVE
A GOOD CHANCE

02:11.381 --> 02:13.050
OF MAKING
THE TOP 300 LIST.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.593
I'M TRYING NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.178
YOU'RE A LOCK TO MAKE
THAT LIST, BRO.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.679
DILLON: SHOULDN'T
YOU BE ON IT, TOO?

02:17.679 --> 02:20.098
I MEAN, YOU'RE
A BIG DEAL IN NEVADA.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.266
WOULDN'T THAT
BE SOMETHING?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.560
BOTH OF YOU,
TOP 300 PLAYERS

02:23.560 --> 02:26.772
IN THE COUNTRY?
WHOOOO!

02:26.772 --> 02:29.650
HONESTLY, IT WOULDN'T
MATTER MUCH FOR ME.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.443
WOULDN'T MATTER?
YOU MAKE THAT LIST,

02:31.443 --> 02:33.362
EVERY COLLEGE IN
THE COUNTRY GONNA BE
COMING AFTER YOU.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.197
YEAH, NOT IF I DON'T
PLAY NEXT YEAR.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.406
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:42.704 --> 02:43.789
HEY.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.875
WISH I COULD SAY
I DON'T KNOW

02:46.875 --> 02:49.169
WHAT YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH, BUT I DO.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.672
I'M REALLY
SORRY, SPENCER.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.135
FIRST TIME HE LEFT,
IT HURT.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.804
I MEAN, I FELT HIS
ABSENCE FOR YEARS,

02:58.804 --> 03:00.639
BUT HE WAS STILL
OUT THERE, YOU KNOW?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.308
BUT NOW THIS TIME,
IT'S...

03:03.308 --> 03:04.643
PERMANENT.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.436
YEAH. THERE'S
JUST SO MUCH

03:06.436 --> 03:08.271
I STILL WANT TO
TALK TO HIM ABOUT,

03:08.271 --> 03:09.272
THINGS I WANT
TO ASK HIM,

03:09.272 --> 03:11.316
AND I CAN'T.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.734
THE HARDEST PART.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.486
I MEAN, IT WAS
FOR ME.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.072
I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS
I WANT TO ASK MY MOM.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.494
HEY. YOU'RE GONNA
BE OK, SPENCER.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.539
SPENCER: WHEN?
LAYLA: EVENTUALLY.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.707
OK. SO, WHAT DO
I DO UNTIL THEN?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.835
I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT WORKED FOR ME.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.504
AT THIS POINT, I'M
WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.715
I JUST PUSHED IT AWAY.
THE PAIN.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.300
THERE'S A VOID
IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW

03:37.300 --> 03:39.052
AND YOU JUST NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FILL IT.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.388
SPENCER: WITH WHAT?
LAYLA: ANYTHING POSITIVE.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.181
DISTRACTIONS.
ISN'T THERE

03:43.181 --> 03:45.767
A RING CEREMONY FOR THE STATE
CHAMPIONSHIPS THIS WEEK?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.270

PLAYER RANKINGS

03:48.270 --> 03:49.354
COME OUT TOMORROW.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.439
I WAS TRYING NOT TO

03:50.439 --> 03:51.857
THINK ABOUT IT, BUT

03:51.857 --> 03:53.442
MAYBE IT IS
A GOOD DISTRACTION.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.486
PUSH AWAY THE PAIN.
FILL THE VOID.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
I KNOW IT'S NOT
EASY, BUT

03:58.363 --> 04:00.490

04:45.494 --> 04:47.245
SCHOOL AND CHOIR PRACTICE.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.580
I WAS WONDERING WHY
I HADN'T SEEN YOU

04:48.580 --> 04:49.706
AROUND MY DAD'S STUDIO.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.124
BUT I CAN STILL

04:57.964 --> 04:59.591

04:59.591 --> 05:02.135
AND HE LOVED
PATIENCE'S VOICE.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.595
DID SHE NOT...?

05:03.595 --> 05:04.596
HE, LIKE, WANTS
TO WORK WITH YOU.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.223
HE THINKS
YOU'RE A STAR.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.558
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE JUST

05:08.558 --> 05:09.976
FORGOT TO TELL ME.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.357
BILLY: WHOA.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.566

LOOKING AT HERE?

05:16.566 --> 05:17.734
WELL, THIS IS A CRIB,

05:17.734 --> 05:19.277
OR AT LEAST IT WILL BE.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.779
JORDAN: YOU WANT TO HELP?
BILLY: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.781

05:26.576 --> 05:27.953
AH. YOU'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.164
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE CRIB.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.415
I KNOW.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.959
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.627

05:43.635 --> 05:44.803
PROBABLY, BUT DON'T
SHAKE IT LIKE THAT.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.681
IT'S SORT OF
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.224
WHEN I WAS BORN,
MY GRANDDADDY

05:49.224 --> 05:50.684
GAVE IT TO MY DAD,

05:50.684 --> 05:53.395
AND HE GAVE IT
TO ME WHEN YOU
AND OLIVIA WERE BORN.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.397
NOW IT'S YOURS.
SOMEDAY, YOU'LL

THE NEXT STEP?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.828
COME ON, MAN.
I JUST NEED
SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.830
WELL, I'M NOT
THE ONLY PERSON

06:53.830 --> 06:55.707
THAT GOT A SNEAK
PEEK AT THAT LIST.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.460
COLLEGE COACHES
STARTED CALLING ME,
TRYING TO GET NEXT

06:58.460 --> 07:00.503
TO YOU, BUT I
TOLD THEM ABOUT
YOUR FATHER

07:00.503 --> 07:01.838
AND THAT YOU
NEEDED TIME.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.131
NO, I DON'T NEED
NO TIME, COACH.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.841
WHOA, WHOA, SPENCER,
THERE'S NO RUSH.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.718
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.054
LOOK, I APPRECIATE YOU,
ALL RIGHT? I DO.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.723

07:39.209 --> 07:40.877
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PLAYERS
THERE ARE IN THE COUNTRY?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.420
SPENCER: NAW. HOW MANY?
COOP: I DON'T KNOW.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.588
THAT WAS A SERIOUS QUESTION.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.423
SOMEBODY SHOULD
REALLY LOOK IT UP.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.592
OLIVIA: OVER A MILLION.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.260
DILLON: WOW! FOR REAL?

08:09.656 --> 08:12.826
YEAH. I JUST
WISH HE KNEW.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.161
HE DOES KNOW,
AND RIGHT NOW HE'S GOT

08:15.161 --> 08:18.081
THAT GREAT BIG SMILE
ON HIS FACE.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.835
I'M GONNA GO GET
SOME PLATES.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.631
COOP: YO, I SAID I'D
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.466
ALL RIGHT.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.720
PREACH WANT ME TO DO
A MIXTAPE RELEASE
PARTY AT THE CAFE,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.680

08:33.680 --> 08:35.557
- AIN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
- YEAH, BUT I JUST DON'T THINK

08:35.557 --> 08:37.058
THE TRACKS IS READY YET.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.977
IS THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT
LAYLA'S POPS SAID?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.520
J.P. LIKED THE TRACKS.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.896
YEAH, BUT HE LOVED
PATIENCE, RIGHT?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.899
WANTS TO WORK WITH HER?
YOU LEFT THAT PART OUT.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.569
I GUESS I FORGOT
TO TELL HER.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.655
LOOK, YOU SAY YOU FORGOT,
I BELIEVE YOU, ALL RIGHT?

08:50.655 --> 08:52.699
BUT YOU GOT TO BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, COOP.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.159
I THINK PREACH IS RIGHT.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.202
THIS COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN,

08:56.202 --> 08:58.371
BUT YOU GOT TO TAKE
A CHANCE, A'IGHT?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.541
♪ WHAT'S A CHILD THAT'S
GOT A SONG... ♪

09:01.541 --> 09:03.585
OLIVIA: THANK YOU.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.336
YOU KNOW I HATE
THE TASTE OF COFFEE,

09:05.336 --> 09:07.756
BUT I CAN'T SEEM
TO FUNCTION WITHOUT
THE EFFECTS.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.758
THANKS AGAIN FOR
MEETING ME, OLIVIA.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.384
I KNOW HOW BUSY
YOU ARE.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.678
I'M A TEENAGER, GWEN.
AS A COLLECTIVE,
WE'RE NOT THAT BUSY.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.347
WELL, ASHER SURE
SEEMS TO BE BUSY.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.183
WELL, HE HAS FOOTBALL,
SO HE'S BUSIER.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.935
COME ON. WE BOTH KNOW
HE'S BEEN AVOIDING ME,

09:20.935 --> 09:23.354
WHICH IS WHY I'VE
ASKED YOU HERE,

09:23.354 --> 09:25.982
AND NO ONE KNOWS ASHER
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.193
WHAT CAN I DO
TO GET HIM BACK?

09:28.193 --> 09:31.738
LOOK, THIS PAST YEAR
HAS BEEN REALLY ROUGH
FOR ASHER,

09:31.738 --> 09:34.699
AND HE NEEDED HIS MOM,
SO MAYBE JUST TRY

09:34.699 --> 09:36.743
TO HELP HIM UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU ABANDONED HIM.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.913
OLIVIA, I WOULD NEVER
WILLINGLY WALK AWAY
FROM MY SON.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.457
IT WAS OUT
OF MY CONTROL.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.334
WHAT, DID SOMEONE HAVE
A GUN TO YOUR HEAD?

09:44.334 --> 09:49.047
NO, NOT EXACTLY.
IT'S JUST I COULDN'T...

09:49.047 --> 09:52.342
WHAT? TELL ME.
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.052
I...

09:54.052 --> 09:56.930
LOOK, OLIVIA, UM,
THIS IS BETWEEN

09:56.930 --> 09:58.932
ME AND
ASHER'S DAD.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.017
I'M SORRY I WASTED
YOUR TIME.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.019
THANK YOU
FOR MEETING ME.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.358
JORDAN: HERE WE GO,
HERE WE GO. RIGHT.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.359
RIGHT TURN, RIGHT TURN.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.777
IF I FALL, I SWEAR...

10:10.777 --> 10:11.736
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FALL.
I PROMISE.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.946
WAIT. WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST ASK ME

10:12.946 --> 10:14.280
TO CLOSE
MY EYES, JORDAN?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.657
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE
MORE SENSE. OK.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.993
READY AND TA-DA!

10:18.993 --> 10:22.580
JORDAN, WHAT IS THIS?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.791
ROOM FOR OUR BABY.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.417
OK, LOOK,
FULL DISCLOSURE.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.002
OLIVIA FIGURED OUT
HOW TO PUT THE CRIB
TOGETHER,

10:28.002 --> 10:30.964
BUT I HANDED HER
THE PIECES,
SO JOINT EFFORT.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.966
- IT'S PERFECT.
- AND THIS EMPTY BOOKSHELF

10:32.966 --> 10:34.968
WILL BE FILLED WITH BOOKS.
GETTING THOSE TODAY.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.846
THIS CHAIR HERE, COMFIEST
CHAIR EVER TO READ IN.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.806
STILL DON'T KNOW HOW
I FEEL ABOUT THE
HORSE, BUT IT'S HERE.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.015
WE CAN FIGURE
THAT OUT LATER.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.643
ONE MORE
SURPRISE, OK?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.186
- OK.
- HERE.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.397
IT DOESN'T TELL TIME
OR ANYTHING, OK,

10:47.397 --> 10:49.524
BUT IT'S
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

10:49.524 --> 10:52.402
MY DAD GAVE IT
TO ME, HIS DAD
GAVE IT TO HIM,

10:52.402 --> 10:55.196
AND SOMEDAY I'LL GIVE
THAT TO OUR CHILD.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.824
JORDAN, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.826
SURE, I DID, OK?
WE'RE--

10:59.826 --> 11:02.662
WE'RE IN THIS
TOGETHER, SIMONE.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.290
YEAH. YEAH.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.041
OK.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.882
PREACH: LOOK, I WANT
THESE EVERYWHERE, MAN.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.216
DON'T COME BACK
UNTIL THEY'RE GONE.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.510
YOU GOT IT,
PREACH.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.013
COOP: YOU JUST AIN'T
GONNA GIVE UP, ARE YOU?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.223
JUST DOING WHAT YOU
ASKED ME TO DO.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.892
SPENCER.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.602
WHAT'S UP?

11:26.769 --> 11:27.812
HEY, THESE ARE DOPE, COOP.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.731
SO WHAT ARE WE
DOING, MAN?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.024
AM I WASTING
MY TIME AGAIN?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.233
YEAH, WE DOING IT, MAN.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.526
LET'S GET MY NAME OUT THERE.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.527
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M

11:34.527 --> 11:35.570
TALKING ABOUT, MAN.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.738
NOW, LOOK, ALL WE GOT

11:36.738 --> 11:37.822
TO DO IS JUST FILL
THIS PLACE UP.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.823
ALL, RIGHT SO ANYTHING

11:38.823 --> 11:39.824
YOU NEED ME TO DO?

11:39.824 --> 11:40.825
MAKE SURE PATIENCE

11:40.825 --> 11:42.243
IS AT THE SHOW.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.912
FOR WHAT? WE DID
ONE SONG TOGETHER.

11:43.912 --> 11:44.746
PATIENCE ADDS
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.039
WHOA, THIS IS NOT A BAND.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.582
I'M A SOLO ACT.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.708
MAN, WHATEVER.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.043
PREACH: HEY, YO.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.045
RIGHT? NOBODY'S
HEARING ME.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.255
OK, SO WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU?

11:54.255 --> 11:56.674
COME ON, MAN.
I DON'T WANT TO GET
INTO THIS AGAIN.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.885
FIRST YOU "FORGOT" TO TELL
PATIENCE ABOUT LAYLA'S POPS,

11:58.885 --> 12:00.386
AND NOW YOU'RE CUTTING
HER OUT YOUR SHOW?

12:00.386 --> 12:02.096
COME ON, MAN, THIS
AIN'T ABOUT PATIENCE.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.057
THIS ABOUT MY MUSIC,
AND I NEED YOU
TO SUPPORT THAT.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.936
DO SUPPORT YOU, COOP,
BUT I'MA ALWAYS TELL YOU
WHEN YOU AIN'T ACTING RIGHT,

12:07.936 --> 12:09.896
AND YOU AIN'T ACTING RIGHT.

12:14.859 --> 12:19.781
HEY, I AM MAKING ONE OF
MY FAMOUS BLTs FOR LUNCH.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.074
YOU WANT ONE?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.951
UH, NO. THANKS.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.577
MAYBE WE CAN GO OUT
AND GRAB A BITE THEN.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.371
UM, I'M ACTUALLY ON
MY WAY TO THE OFFICE.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.581
- WELL, IT'S SUNDAY.
- BUSY WEEK.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.876
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ME
AFTER WE HAD OUR LITTLE--

12:31.876 --> 12:33.586
MISTAKE?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.088
WAIT, IS IT A MISTAKE

12:35.088 --> 12:36.839
TO SLEEP WITH
YOUR OWN HUSBAND?

12:36.839 --> 12:39.509
SORRY. A MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS?

12:39.509 --> 12:42.303
OH. WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A--A STEP FORWARD.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.722
UM, I REALLY NEED TO GET
TO THE OFFICE, BILLY.
I'VE GOT TO.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.685
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
DON'T LET ME, UH,
KEEP YOU FROM IT.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.939
- OH, NICE SHOT.
- THANKS.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.148
YOU KNOW, I'M
JUST SAYING,

12:54.148 --> 12:55.650
IF SPENCER HADN'T
TRANSFERRED TO BEVERLY,

12:55.650 --> 12:57.318
TAKING MY POSITION
AND ALL MY STATS, I'D HAVE

12:57.318 --> 12:59.237
DEFINITELY MADE
THAT TOP 300 LIST.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.738
SO WHAT DID YOUR DAD SAY?

13:00.738 --> 13:01.906
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.574
THINGS ARE GOOD
BETWEEN US NOW,

13:03.574 --> 13:05.243
BUT WHENEVER FOOTBALL
COMES UP, I ALWAYS FEEL

13:05.243 --> 13:06.786
LIKE HE'S
DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.414
SO MAYBE TALK
TO YOUR MOM INSTEAD.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.001
WAIT. WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.255
SHE ASKED TO MEET ME
FOR COFFEE.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.215
- WHAT?
- SHE WANTS YOU IN HER LIFE

13:19.215 --> 13:20.800
AND THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD HELP.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.926
SHE WAITED
TOO LONG, OLIVIA.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.553
SHE COULD HAVE
REACHED OUT MONTHS AGO.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.013
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
SHE COULDN'T?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.389
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.891
SHE SAID SHE'D
NEVER WILLINGLY

13:28.891 --> 13:29.976
WALK AWAY
FROM HER SON.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.562
OK, BUT SHE DID, SO--

13:32.562 --> 13:35.815
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER
IF SOMEONE MADE HER
STAY AWAY.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.276
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS BEING

13:38.276 --> 13:40.653
BETWEEN HER
AND YOUR DAD.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.946
WHAT, MY DAD? NO.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.574
HE WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO...

13:44.574 --> 13:47.410
PEOPLE DO
MESSED-UP THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE HURTING.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.914
SIMONE: HEY.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.666
YOUR MOM LET ME IN.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.794
HEY, I THINK WE
OFFICIALLY HAVE EVERY
CHILDREN'S BOOK EVER MADE.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.963
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER,
LIKE, 40 DR. SEUSS BOOKS?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.965
IT'S CRAZY.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.467
WHAT? W-WHAT'S UP?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.594
YOU OK? YOU--YOU
DON'T LIKE DR. SEUSS?

14:04.594 --> 14:06.596
JORDAN...

14:06.596 --> 14:08.931
I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.184
- YOU CAN'T ACCEPT WHAT?
- ANY OF IT.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.978
THE ROOM, THE CRIB,
THE WATCH.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.731
ALL THAT YOU'RE
DOING FOR ME, I--

14:16.731 --> 14:19.025
WHOA, WHOA, I'M NOT JUST
DOING THIS FOR YOU, OK?

14:19.025 --> 14:21.235
I'M DOING THIS FOR US,
FOR OUR BABY.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.782
THAT'S THE THING,
JORDAN.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.787
IT'S NOT YOURS.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.794
WOW.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.090
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:42.090 --> 14:45.468
WHEN I FIRST FOUND
OUT THAT I WAS
PREGNANT, I WAS...

14:45.468 --> 14:49.055
JUST FEELING
REALLY ALONE,
AND--AND SCARED,

14:49.055 --> 14:52.058
AND THEN I JUST--
I SAW YOUR FAMILY,
AND THEY WERE JUST SO--

14:52.058 --> 14:54.310
- WHAT, WE WERE
SO RICH, IS THAT IT?
- NO, NO, JORDAN.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.104
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE MONEY.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.730
I SAW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVED YOUR FAMILY,

14:57.730 --> 15:02.276
AND I JUST...I WANTED SOMEBODY
TO LOVE MY KID LIKE THAT.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.529
WHO'S THE FATHER,
SIMONE?

15:07.156 --> 15:09.867
SOMEONE I DON'T WANT
IN MY BABY'S LIFE.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.036
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE ME
THINK I WAS GONNA BE A DAD.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.331
I KNOW, AND I FEEL TERRIBLE.
JORDAN, I JUST DON'T
WANT YOU TO HATE--

15:15.331 --> 15:17.708
LOOK, LOOK,
SIMONE, PLEASE,

15:17.708 --> 15:20.169
I NEED YOU TO GO.

15:34.058 --> 15:38.312
WAS IT JUST ME, OR WAS
MR. VEGA SINGLING ME OUT
IN CLASS TODAY?

15:38.312 --> 15:40.148
HE CALLED ON ME,
LIKE, 6 TIMES.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.899
I MEAN, YOU DID MISS
HALF THE SEMESTER.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.068
HE'S PROBABLY JUST
MAKING UP THE TIME.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.903
SOLID POINT.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.530
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

15:47.530 --> 15:49.407
NAH, I'M GOOD.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.076
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.911
IT'S ABOUT YOUR ADVICE.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.913
I'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING IT,
YOU KNOW,

15:55.913 --> 15:59.083
FILLING THE VOID,
KEEPING MYSELF
DISTRACTED, BUT

15:59.083 --> 16:01.127
IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE WORKING.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.130
AND I GOT ALL
THIS GREAT STUFF
HAPPENING. I MEAN,

16:04.130 --> 16:07.341
I'M THE 57th-RANKED
PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.969
BUT IT'S NOT MAKING
ME FEEL BETTER.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.345
IT'S ONLY BEEN
A COUPLE WEEKS.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.347
I DIDN'T SAY
IT'D BE EASY.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.766
JUST TRY TO KEEP
YOUR MIND BUSY.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.101
OK.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.145
DO YOU MIND IF I HANG
HERE FOR A WHILE?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.314
EVERYBODY ELSE KEEPS
TRYING TO MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.566
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO ACTUALLY DOES.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.863
ACTUALLY, I COULD
USE YOUR HELP.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.073
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

16:31.073 --> 16:34.327
UM...RESEARCH,
I GUESS.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.996
IS IT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.040
YEAH.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.125
MY DAD TOLD ME
SHE WAS SUFFERING

16:41.125 --> 16:43.169
FROM DEPRESSION
WHEN SHE DIED.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.379
NOT LONG BEFORE
THE ACCIDENT,

16:45.379 --> 16:48.257
SHE WROTE THIS SONG
ABOUT GIVING UP

16:48.257 --> 16:49.884
AND ENDING ALL THE PAIN.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.761
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

16:51.761 --> 16:56.390
WELL, LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.768
HERE, READ
THE HIGHLIGHTED PART.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.687
"KEATING'S CAR
WAS TRAVELING
APPROXIMATELY

17:01.687 --> 17:06.067
61 MILES PER HOUR
WHEN IT...
HIT THE WALL."

17:07.610 --> 17:10.613
"ACCORDING TO POLICE,
THERE WERE NO TIRE MARKS
BEFORE IMPACT."

17:10.613 --> 17:12.073
- SHE DIDN'T BRAKE.
- LAYLA--

17:12.073 --> 17:15.243
WHAT IF IT WASN'T
AN ACCIDENT?

17:15.243 --> 17:19.247
WHAT IF MY MOM...
K-KILLED HERSELF?

17:19.247 --> 17:22.208
AND WHAT IF SHE FELL
ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL?
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.293
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO DOES IS GONE.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.878
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE
TO KNOW THE ANSWER, OK?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.422
I HAVE TO KNOW,
AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.096
WHAT'S THIS?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.722
HAVE SOME RESPECT, OK?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.724
IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.
DAD GAVE IT TO ME.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.602
- SHOULD I BE OFFENDED?
- NO, JUST KEEP IT.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.604
IT'S YOURS NOW.
THE ONLY REASON DAD
GAVE IT TO ME IS BECAUSE

17:43.604 --> 17:47.024
HE THOUGHT I WAS HAVING
A KID, BUT--BREAKING NEWS--

17:47.024 --> 17:49.610
I'M NOT.
SIMONE LIED TO ME.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.529
TO ALL OF US, ACTUALLY.
SHE MADE EVERYTHING UP.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.656
WAIT.
SIMONE ISN'T PREGNANT?

17:53.656 --> 17:56.409
SHE DIDN'T MAKE EVERYTHING
UP; SHE IS PREGNANT,
BUT I'M NOT THE FATHER.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.121
SHE ONLY SAID I WAS BECAUSE
SHE KNEW I'D STEP UP.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.124
- UM, IS SHE OK?
- SHE OK?

18:03.124 --> 18:05.459
REALLY?
I'M THE VICTIM HERE, LIV.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.461
YOU'RE NOT A VICTIM,
JORDAN, OK?

18:07.461 --> 18:09.463
SHE DID SOMETHING
STUPID OUT OF FEAR,

18:09.463 --> 18:10.923
BUT SHE'S STILL
PREGNANT AND ALONE.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.050
WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU EVEN ON?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.052
THERE'S ONLY ONE SIDE.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.096
THE BABY'S SIDE, OK?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.265
AND MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE
NOT SO UPSET,

18:19.265 --> 18:21.767
YOU'LL REALIZE THAT.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.440
MAN: EVERYONE KNOWS WE
HAVE THE BEST FACILITIES
IN THE COUNTRY,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.442
BUT LET'S TALK
ABOUT GAME DAY.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.569
WE'RE ON NATIONAL TV
EVERY WEEK.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.780
EXPECT TO COMPETE IN
CHAMPIONSHIPS EVERY YEAR,

18:34.780 --> 18:37.158
AND WE SEND OUR BEST
PLAYERS TO THE NFL.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.161
WE BELIEVE YOU COULD BE
ONE OF THE VERY BEST
TO EVER PLAY, SON.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.330
GRACE: ARE YOU OFFERING
SPENCER A SCHOLARSHIP?

18:42.330 --> 18:46.292
COACH: MRS. JAMES, SPENCER HAD
AN OFFER BEFORE I WALKED
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.295
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE HAPPIER, SON.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.465
I AM.
SORRY. UH...

18:52.465 --> 18:54.175
DO I GOT TO
ANSWER NOW?

18:54.175 --> 18:57.470
OF COURSE NOT.
WE'D LOVE TO BRING YOU
IN FOR AN OFFICIAL VISIT.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.138
YOU BOTH SHOULD COME WITH HIM.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.890
GOT IT.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.476
THIS OFFER ISN'T
GOING AWAY, SPENCER.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.478
YOU HAVE A SPOT ON OUR TEAM.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.480
TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU NEED.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.315
DARNELL: HEY, UH,
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.317
I JUST CAME BY
TO PICK UP SPENCER.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.985
COOP'S THING.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.737
OH. RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.822
I GOT TO GO,
BUT THANK YOU
FOR COMING, COACH.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.699
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME, SPENCER.
- MY PLEASURE.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.743
GRACE: THANK YOU.
SPENCER: OH,

19:20.743 --> 19:22.161
YOU KNOW
DARNELL HAYES, RIGHT?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.163
COACH: OF COURSE.
NEVADA,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.998
TRANSFERRED TO
SOUTH CRENSHAW.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.167
I CALLED OVER THERE TODAY.
I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.169
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
PROBABLY 'CAUSE I'M
TRANSFERRING AGAIN.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.754
SPENCER: WHAT?
COACH: WHERE TO?

19:31.754 --> 19:33.381
MY MOM'S STATIONED
IN GERMANY,

19:33.381 --> 19:35.132
SO I'M GONNA LIVE
WITH HER.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.385
- WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
- A FEW DAYS,

19:37.385 --> 19:40.388
BUT--BUT I DON'T
EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE A
FOOTBALL TEAM THERE, SO--

19:40.388 --> 19:43.349
COACH: IF YOUR PLANS
CHANGE, I'D LOVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

19:43.349 --> 19:47.144
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
IN OUR OFFENSE AT UCLA
WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.984
PATIENCE: HEY.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.986
THIS IS CRAZY.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.321
YOU NERVOUS?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.739
HELL YEAH, I'M NERVOUS.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.366
I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD BE NERVOUS.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.243
I HAVEN'T EVEN
PERFORMED MY SONG
AT A STUDIO YET,

20:02.243 --> 20:03.994
BUT IT'S OK.
I'MA BE GOOD.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.623
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA
GO WITH THE ORIGINAL
VERSION TONIGHT.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.792
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
LOVED THE REMIX.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.421
NO, I DO, BUT, I MEAN,
TONIGHT IS ABOUT GETTING
MY NAME OUT THERE, SOLO.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.424
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

20:16.424 --> 20:19.009
I AM KIND OF, LIKE,
WONDERING SOMETHING NOW.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.554
LOOK, I KNOW ABOUT J.P.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.389
AND HOW HE TOLD YOU
THAT HE LIKED MY VOICE.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.349
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST ASSUMED THAT
YOU FORGOT TO TELL ME,

20:25.349 --> 20:27.685
BUT NOW I'M KINDA FEELING
LIKE YOU JUST DIDN'T
WANT ME WORKING WITH HIM.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.395
I MEAN, SINGING IS
JUST A HOBBY FOR YOU.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.896
IT'S NOT YOUR DREAM.
THIS IS MY DREAM.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.441
OK, SO NOW I'M TRYING
TO STEAL YOUR DREAM? NO.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.901
ALL I'VE EVER DONE WAS TRY
TO SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR DREAMS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.195
OK, OK, OK, SO WHY ARE YOU
MAKING THIS ABOUT YOU?

20:38.195 --> 20:40.406
OK. RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:40.406 --> 20:43.200
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND MAKE ALL OF YOUR
DREAMS COME TRUE?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.243
- WHAT?
- NO, NO, NO.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.579
IT'S OK, I WON'T
STAND IN YOUR WAY.

THE BEST TIME OF MY LIFE.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.293
COLLEGES COMING AFTER ME.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.212
YO, THAT COACH IS PRETTY
INTERESTED IN YOU, DAWG.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.172

22:20.172 --> 22:21.507
I MADE MY DECISION, BRO.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.508
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

LINE OUTSIDE?

22:30.140 --> 22:31.350
MAN, PREACH SET THAT UP.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.935

A CROWD? THAT'S CR--

22:35.479 --> 22:39.525
GENIUS, RIGHT?
YEAH. HA HA!

22:40.776 --> 22:42.403
SPENCER: PATIENCE OK?

22:42.403 --> 22:45.114
NOPE. YOU WAS RIGHT.
SHE IS NOT TALKING TO ME.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.032
ALL RIGHT. SO GO FIX IT.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.451
WHAT, YOU THINK I
SHOULD ASK HER TO
PERFORM WITH ME TONIGHT?

22:49.451 --> 22:51.579
ONLY IF YOU
WANT HER TO.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.497
DO YOU?

23:04.341 --> 23:06.385
MAKE THAT LINE...

23:07.553 --> 23:09.138
BETTER MAKE THAT...

23:10.389 --> 23:11.849
HEY.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.853

RING CEREMONY OR WHAT?

23:16.937 --> 23:19.565
UM, I'VE BEEN WAITING

23:19.565 --> 23:21.358
TO GIVE YOU THESE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW

23:21.358 --> 23:23.360
IF THERE'S EVER GONNA
BE A RIGHT TIME.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.653
WHAT'S THIS?

23:24.653 --> 23:28.407
THEY ARE LEGAL
SEPARATION PAPERS.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.451
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23:30.451 --> 23:31.452
YES.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.579
WHOA. HOLD ON. HOLD UP.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.831
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.417

COMING FROM?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.793
WHY SO ALL OF A SUDDEN?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.795
IT'S NOT ALL OF
A SUDDEN, BILLY.

23:43.464 --> 23:46.175
LOOK, IF WE'RE GONNA
GET A DIVORCE,

23:46.175 --> 23:47.676
THEN WE HAVE TO BE

23:47.676 --> 23:50.471
LEGALLY SEPARATED
FOR A YEAR FIRST.

23:50.471 --> 23:53.432
A DIVORCE.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.476
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

23:55.476 --> 23:58.854
WHAT I WANT IS TO
MOVE FORWARD,

23:58.854 --> 24:02.399
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO
THAT IS SEPARATED.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.986
I DON'T WANT THAT.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.404
I'M SORRY.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.823
L--LAURA.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.701

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.502
THANK YOU. HEY, UM, DJ,

24:21.502 --> 24:23.087
DON'T PLAY THAT MUSIC JUST YET.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.464
UM, I GOT SOMETHING I WANT
TO GET OFF MY CHEST,

24:25.464 --> 24:26.715
IF YOU ALL DON'T MIND.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.925
YO, WHAT'S SHE DOING?

24:27.925 --> 24:29.593
GUESS WE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.887
UM, I'M A BAD GIRLFRIEND,

24:31.887 --> 24:33.597
AND I DID SOME THINGS
I SHOULDN'T,

24:33.597 --> 24:35.557
AND I SAID A LOT
THAT I SHOULDN'T.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.476
I WAS A LITTLE JEALOUS, TOO.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.437
I GUESS I THOUGHT I WAS AFRAID
OF LOSING MY DREAM TO HER,

24:40.437 --> 24:44.441
BUT I REALIZED
IT WASN'T MY DREAM THAT
I WAS AFRAID OF LOSING.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.695
THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND BACK THERE.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.947
PATIENCE, YOU CAN WAVE
IF YOU WANT TO.

24:49.947 --> 24:53.826
SHE'S TALENTED, YO,
AND IT'S UNMATCHED.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.036
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN NOTHING
LIKE IT,

24:56.036 --> 24:58.706
AND I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT IF
PEOPLE KNEW

24:58.706 --> 25:02.543
HOW TALENTED SHE WAS THAT
I'D LOSE HER.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.169
AND TO JUST KEEP IT 100
WITH Y'ALL,

25:04.169 --> 25:05.671
SHE'S THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.465
-AW.
-AW.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.844
COOP: AND THIS NEXT SONG,
IT JUST WOULDN'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT HER

25:11.844 --> 25:14.638
BECAUSE SHE TRULY
MAKES ME BETTER IN EVERY WAY.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.348
TO BE HONEST, BABE,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.559
I'M NOT WILLING TO PERFORM
THIS SONG WITHOUT YOU.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.646
I KNOW YOU AIN'T GONNA LEAVE

27:07.668 --> 27:10.879
WAS MOM'S CAR ACCIDENT
AN ACCIDENT,

27:10.879 --> 27:12.840
OR DID SHE GIVE UP?

27:14.842 --> 27:16.718
KEATING'S CAR WAS TRAVELING

27:16.718 --> 27:20.973
APPROXIMATELY 61 MILES PER HOUR
WHEN IT HIT THE WALL.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.569
YOU NEED HELP.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.255
HEY.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.052
HEY.
THANKS FOR COMING.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.723
YOU OK?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.516
NO.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.356
I, UM...

28:52.356 --> 28:54.983
I NEED HELP.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.903
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD YOU ADMIT THAT.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.406
YOU WERE RIGHT, SPENCER.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.160
AND YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO HELP ME FOR MONTHS,

29:05.160 --> 29:07.287
AND ALL I DID WAS,
LIKE, PUSH YOU AWAY.

29:07.287 --> 29:11.291
YEAH, BUT I'M STILL HERE.
I'M STILL HERE.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.337
WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:15.337 --> 29:17.756
I GUESS I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT

29:17.756 --> 29:19.132
ABOUT MY MOM'S
ACCIDENT,

29:19.132 --> 29:22.928
AND I WAS GONNA BRAKE.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.096
YEAH, AND YOU DID.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.639
YEAH, BUT THERE WAS--

29:25.639 --> 29:27.099
THERE WAS, LIKE,
A MOMENT

29:27.099 --> 29:28.934
WHERE I HESITATED.

29:32.854 --> 29:37.609
FOR MONTHS, I'VE
JUST BEEN TRYING
TO DO EVERYTHING

29:37.609 --> 29:43.365
TO FEEL SOMETHING,
ANYTHING AND...

29:43.365 --> 29:46.785
I'M JUST NUMB.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.912
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU NEVER REALLY FACED

29:48.912 --> 29:50.622
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
YOUR MOM.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.333
AND YOU NOT DEALING WITH
THAT PROBABLY SNOWBALLED

29:53.333 --> 29:56.461
INTO YOU NOT DEALING
WITH A LOT OF THINGS.

29:58.005 --> 30:01.550
I'M GONNA NEED HELP
TO GET THROUGH THIS,

30:03.176 --> 30:04.761
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.972
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'M ADMITTING THAT.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.226
I JUST KNOW MY OWN
THOUGHTS TONIGHT
SCARED ME.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.270
HEY, HEY, HEY. NOW,
COME HERE. COME HERE.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.981
I GOT YOU.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.983
IT'S OK.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.446
IT'S OK.

30:22.446 --> 30:23.947
IT'S OK.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.663
GWEN: ALL RIGHT.
UH, NOW THAT WE'VE HAD

30:31.663 --> 30:34.374
THE WORLD'S MOST AWKWARD
DINNER, WOULD YOU MIND

30:34.374 --> 30:36.084
TELLING US WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

30:36.084 --> 30:38.211
I WANT THE TRUTH.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.797
MOM, I REALLY
NEEDED YOU, AND
YOU ABANDONED ME.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.299
I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.301
YEAH. YOU HURT BOTH
OF US WHEN YOU LEFT.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.887
OH, YOU SHUT UP, HAROLD.
DON'T YOU PLAY
THE VICTIM HERE.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.513
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

30:48.513 --> 30:50.932
BETWEEN LEAVING YOU
AND ABANDONING MY SON.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.018
I LEFT YOU WILLINGLY.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.436
SO YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME
WILLINGLY?

30:54.436 --> 30:57.189
OLIVIA: WAIT. WHAT EXACTLY
DOES THAT MEAN, GWEN?

31:03.737 --> 31:07.866
YOUR FATHER MADE ME PROMISE
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.618
IS THAT TRUE?

31:09.618 --> 31:11.620
GWEN: AND IF I BROKE
THAT PROMISE,

31:11.620 --> 31:14.206
HE WOULD TELL EVERYBODY--
OUR FRIENDS

31:14.206 --> 31:17.667
BUT, MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU--

31:17.667 --> 31:21.671
THAT MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO,
I WAS AN ESCORT.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.427
I'M JUST--

31:29.763 --> 31:32.724
WAIT. WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT?

31:32.724 --> 31:36.144
GWEN: SWEETHEART,
THAT'S HOW WE MET.

31:37.562 --> 31:41.108
GWEN: NOW, LOOK, HONEY,
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DID.

31:41.108 --> 31:44.653
I WAS YOUNG.
I NEEDED TO SURVIVE.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.072
BUT I AM ASHAMED THAT I LET
YOUR FATHER CONVINCE ME

31:47.072 --> 31:48.657
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU
FOR SO LONG.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.118
KEEPING THAT SECRET JUST
WASN'T WORTH THE COST,

31:51.118 --> 31:53.912
AND FOR THAT, I AM SO SORRY.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.809
BILLY: IT TAKES A LOT OF
BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS

32:15.809 --> 32:19.604
TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP,
AND A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.398
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET
THE RECOGNITION

32:21.398 --> 32:25.944
AND THE BANNERS AND THE MEMORIES
THAT LAST A LIFETIME,

36:29.187 --> 36:30.313
I'VE BEEN CRYING
NONSTOP.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.023
I'M SORRY.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.983
I MEAN, YOU HAVE EVERY
RIGHT TO BE ANGRY WITH ME.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.985
I'M NOT ANGRY, SIMONE.

36:35.985 --> 36:40.198
OK, I--I'M ANGRY.
I'M A LOT OF THINGS.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.866
BUT I KNOW WHY YOU DID IT.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.202
AND I ALSO KNOW HOW ALONE
YOU MUST FEEL RIGHT NOW.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.413
AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M GONNA BE THERE

36:46.413 --> 36:47.539
FOR THE BABY.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.749
JORDAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.419
I KNOW. I KNOW,
BUT I WANT TO.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.215
AND THAT CRIB
THAT OLIVIA SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO PUT TOGETHER,

36:57.215 --> 36:59.426
IT'S YOURS.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.428
AND SO IS THIS.

37:01.428 --> 37:05.974
THANK YOU,
BUT I CAN'T
ACCEPT THAT.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.767
IT BELONGS IN
YOUR FAMILY,

37:07.767 --> 37:10.687
AND YOU CAN GIVE IT TO
YOUR OWN KID SOMEDAY.

37:10.687 --> 37:14.274
BUT THOSE DR. SEUSS
BOOKS. I WILL
TAKE THOSE.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.197
ASHER: WHY'D YOU
BRING ME HERE?

37:21.197 --> 37:22.574
OLIVIA: BECAUSE THIS
PLACE ALWAYS MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.325
IS IT WORKING YET?

37:24.325 --> 37:25.577
I DON'T KNOW WHO I'M
MORE MAD AT--

37:25.577 --> 37:27.245
MY DAD FOR
BLACKMAILING MY MOM

37:27.245 --> 37:28.788
OR MY MOM
FOR GIVING IN.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.166
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.211
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D
DO WITHOUT YOU, LIV.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.672
SERIOUSLY.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.383
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE PERSON
THAT STOOD BY ME.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.386
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR, RIGHT?

37:43.386 --> 37:45.346
RIGHT.

37:45.346 --> 37:47.223
WE SHOULD GET IN.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.475
LIV.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.393
COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.688
COME ON, LIV.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.400
WE'RE MORE THAN
FRIENDS, OLIVIA.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.906
WE'VE ALREADY HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.324
I KNOW.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.868
I KNOW. BUT IF I'VE LEARNED
ANYTHING THIS LAST WEEK,

38:06.868 --> 38:09.621
IT'S THAT I DON'T WANT
TO BE DISHONEST.

38:09.621 --> 38:13.875
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO BE JUST FRIENDS.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.418
ASHER,
YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS

38:15.418 --> 38:17.879
THE BEST THING IN
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.297
WHY RISK THAT?

38:19.297 --> 38:22.217
A CHANCE OF SOMETHING
EVEN BETTER.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.846
BUT--BUT WHAT IF...?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.556
WHAT IF...

38:30.475 --> 38:33.228
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU?

38:37.482 --> 38:39.859
WHAT IF...

38:39.859 --> 38:42.153
I KISSED YOU
RIGHT NOW?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.533
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO KISS YOU,

38:46.533 --> 38:49.160
YOU'D BETTER

I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.685
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
FOOTBALL NO MORE.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.605
I LOVE THE GAME,
BUT I REALIZE NOW

39:17.605 --> 39:19.899
IT WAS MY WAY OF
CONNECTING WITH YOU.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.904
NOW IT JUST HURTS
TOO MUCH TO PLAY.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.909
SO NOW IT'S TIME
TO FIGURE OUT

39:29.909 --> 39:31.411

39:52.640 --> 39:55.518
YOU SURE YOU WANT THIS?

39:55.518 --> 39:58.354
YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.442
IT'S WHAT'S BEST
FOR ME, COACH.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.529
OK.

40:08.615 --> 40:11.868
THEN I SUPPORT YOU.
