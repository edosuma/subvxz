Yes, they're looking for a new home.

03:24.875 --> 03:25.958
But, as you say,

03:26.750 --> 03:29.916
the only Skrull contact
has been through Nick Fury.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.666
That means they're our allies.

See, that's what I'm worried about.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.708
The Fury I knew
was always three steps ahead.

39:51.833 --> 39:55.416
If I remember correctly, you called me.

39:55.916 --> 39:57.583
Upon Talos's request.

39:58.750 --> 40:02.375
Your lack of contact over the past
few years sent a pretty clear message.

40:02.458 --> 40:03.708
Meaning?

40:10.416 --> 40:12.458
You're not ready for this, Fury.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.875
There's a very real threat out there.

40:15.958 --> 40:19.250
You were never the same after The Blip.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.333
You always told me there is no shame

40:22.416 --> 40:25.625
in walking away
when the steps are uncertain.

40:27.416 --> 40:28.625
So check your footing.

40:30.041 --> 40:31.666
Otherwise someone's gonna get hurt.

40:45.583 --> 40:46.750
Oh, no.

40:48.041 --> 40:49.166
Mother...

41:22.916 --> 41:23.916
Good work.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.041
I barely made it out.
Someone was waiting for me.

41:29.833 --> 41:31.583
Someone you can identify?

41:31.666 --> 41:32.750
G'IAH: No.

41:34.541 --> 41:36.000
Maybe we postpone the strike.

41:37.583 --> 41:42.375
To the contrary.
Thanks to you, we have the bait.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
(SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE)

42:10.958 --> 42:12.625
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

42:54.000 --> 42:55.250
Thanks for coming to see me.

42:55.333 --> 42:58.333
You don't see me because I'm not here.

42:59.083 --> 43:00.875
I understand. You're taking a risk.

43:01.250 --> 43:02.375
A risk?

43:03.041 --> 43:07.041
Is that what you explained to Mum,
that following you could get her killed?

43:07.125 --> 43:12.375
Your mother died
while you were working for her killer.

43:13.041 --> 43:16.208
So do not take me down that road, G'iah.

43:16.291 --> 43:19.583
You have one chance to save yourself.

43:19.666 --> 43:21.250
And I think you know that.

43:22.291 --> 43:24.000
I think that's why you're here.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.625
The attack is planned for tomorrow.

43:34.708 --> 43:35.833
Unity Day.

43:37.458 --> 43:40.958
There are three bombs.
And Gravik knows you'll be there.

43:41.708 --> 43:43.500
-How?
-I don't know.

43:44.125 --> 43:47.750
There are so many operatives in the field.
A hundred, at least.

43:48.541 --> 43:49.666
Fracking pods?

43:50.083 --> 43:52.708
Most of their identities are kept secret,
even from us.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.875
Your mum would be very proud of you,
you know, for coming to see me.

44:09.333 --> 44:13.416
Tomorrow, there are three couriers,
including me.

44:13.500 --> 44:16.083
All the points
near Vossoyedineniye Square.

44:17.041 --> 44:19.166
I'll mark each bag with infrared spray.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.000

not the people.

45:05.125 --> 45:07.500
FURY: Lot of backpacks in Central Moscow.

45:07.583 --> 45:10.750
G'iah's painted ours with infrared spray.

45:11.791 --> 45:13.083
Infrared. Got it.

45:26.083 --> 45:27.333
HILL: We missed the pass.

45:35.625 --> 45:37.500
FURY: Got one carrier going northeast.

45:40.125 --> 45:42.583
The other one south. Let's move.

45:47.708 --> 45:49.125
