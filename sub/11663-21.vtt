(Rose)<i> On the last episode of</i>
The Golden Girls...

00:43.333 --> 00:47.033
See if I forgot to invite anybody
to my moonlight madness party.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.100
The women.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.233
Dorothy, tonight's a full moon,

00:51.300 --> 00:54.300
a night when men's passions,
like the tides,

00:54.367 --> 00:58.633
are pulled to their highest,
achingly unbearable peak.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.767
I won an all-expenses-paid
honeymoon trip to Paris, France!

01:02.834 --> 01:07.633
Call me old-fashioned, but if we got
a proposal here, let's do it right.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.600
Oh, of course.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.467
Miles...

01:14.567 --> 01:18.867
if you'd marry me, you'd make me
the happiest woman in the world.

01:19.367 --> 01:24.066
Leap year... full moon...
Oh, my God. The curse.

01:24.567 --> 01:27.266
So now there are three tasks
I must perform

01:27.333 --> 01:31.667
before tomorrow's moonrise,
or you are doomed.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.934
And the three tasks are...

01:34.000 --> 01:37.900
Kiss a fool,
help a holy man,

01:37.967 --> 01:40.066
reveal betrayal of a loved one.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.633
Hot damn!

01:46.767 --> 01:48.967
A blessing for the couple.

01:49.033 --> 01:53.433
You invited a rabbi to a moonlight
madness party?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.867
May God bless and, oy!

01:57.333 --> 01:59.500
Oh, look.
A holy man in need of help.

02:01.934 --> 02:03.700
Oh!

02:06.633 --> 02:08.967
Hello, Judas.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.867
(serene music playing)

02:43.867 --> 02:45.967
I'm sorry, Miles.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.667
No, no. No, Dorothy.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.700
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

02:50.767 --> 02:54.133
No, wait a minute.
Why should we be sorry?

02:54.200 --> 02:57.166
We've known each other
a long time.

02:57.233 --> 02:59.600
Things like this just happen.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.200
There's nothing wrong
with two people

03:01.266 --> 03:02.700
showing each other
how they feel.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.734
-We're friends.
-We're scum.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.567
Herring balls?

03:13.900 --> 03:17.166
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, excuse me. More guests.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.367
-Don't hurry.
-Ha-ha-ha!

03:19.433 --> 03:21.800
I love the way you British talk.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.000
Well, hurry back,
and I'll say more words.

03:26.066 --> 03:27.266
Oh.

03:31.266 --> 03:33.333
Dreyfuss.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.000
I guess I did invite
every male in town.

03:41.967 --> 03:44.333
-Hello, pup.
-I'm sorry, Derek.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.533
Oh, that's all right.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.333
We British love dogs.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.467
It's children we can't stand.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.900
Herring balls?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.967
I'm sorry, Rose.
I'm just sorry.

03:56.033 --> 03:59.000
That's all right.
Not everybody likes them,

03:59.066 --> 04:01.734
but Miles has just disappeared.
Have you seen him?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.900
-I will have a herring ball.
-What about Miles?

04:04.967 --> 04:06.300
And one for later.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.633
Oh, Ma, I've done
something terrible.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.133
I didn't think it was going
to happen, but it did.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.333
I am so ashamed.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.567
I'm sure you're blowing this
out of proportion.

04:20.633 --> 04:23.100
The Dorothy I raised
is a good catholic girl.

04:23.166 --> 04:27.467
And what's worse, in the process,
I have hurt a friend.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.233
A true friend will
forgive you anything

04:30.300 --> 04:31.767
and love you,
no matter what,

04:31.834 --> 04:34.333
just as I love you,
no matter what.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.233
What did you do
that's so terrible?

04:38.300 --> 04:40.000
I hugged Miles.

04:40.066 --> 04:42.467
You're going to hell, missy.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.200
What, for hugging a man?

04:45.266 --> 04:46.800
For lying to your mother.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.800
I saw what went on.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.333
It was a little kiss.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.567
Little kiss? I haven't seen
that kind of face-eating

04:52.633 --> 04:54.233
since <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

04:57.000 --> 05:00.166
Ma, what am I going to do?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.300
We'll use this
for your own good.

05:02.367 --> 05:05.767
Once I've told Rose
that I saw you kissing Miles,

05:05.834 --> 05:08.834
I'll have satisfied all the terms of
the curse of the <i>strega.</i>

05:08.900 --> 05:11.300
You cannot tell Rose,

05:11.367 --> 05:14.367
and I can't believe you're still
talking about that silly curse.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.633
I've worked my butt off for you.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.433
I kissed a fool,
I helped a holy man,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.500
and I witnessed the betrayal
of a loved one.

05:21.567 --> 05:24.633
That's a lot of work for a woman
who nods off all day on the couch.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.033
Ma, please.

05:28.100 --> 05:32.367
Please, if somebody has
to tell Rose, please let it be me.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.266
That won't satisfy the curse.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.867
Besides, I'm doing this
for your own good.

05:35.934 --> 05:38.433
For my own good?
The last time you said that,

05:38.500 --> 05:43.133
you volunteered me
for psychological experiments.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.567
Hey, the pay was good...
and to this day, nobody,

05:48.633 --> 05:51.667
nobody can make it through
a maze faster than you can.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.266
Dorothy,
where's the cheese?

05:56.333 --> 06:00.467
Right turn, left turn, front turn.

06:00.533 --> 06:04.667
Must find the cheese.
Must find the cheese.

06:04.734 --> 06:05.667
Dorothy?

06:06.834 --> 06:09.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:09.066 --> 06:13.133
Listen, Rose...
Rose, may I ask you a question,

06:13.200 --> 06:14.800
a purely hypothetical question?

06:14.867 --> 06:17.266
Oh, sure.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.133
Let's say that,

06:19.200 --> 06:23.600
you make Miles a batch of
your delicious creamy cupcakes,

06:23.667 --> 06:25.000
and he loves them so much

06:25.066 --> 06:27.433
that he wants you to make them
all the time.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.834
Miles does have a sweet tooth.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.800
But let's say that

06:31.867 --> 06:35.100
even though he loves your
cupcakes more than life itself,

06:35.166 --> 06:41.266
one day he decides to try
somebody else's cupcakes.

06:42.867 --> 06:47.433
For lack of a better example,
let's say my cupcakes,

06:47.500 --> 06:51.600
and I, in a mad,
passionate moment,

06:51.667 --> 06:55.734
forget myself
and let him try my cupcakes.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.200
How would that
make you feel?

06:59.266 --> 07:01.266
I'd like to think I'd understand.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.166
Oh, good.

07:03.233 --> 07:06.133
Good. I was hoping
that's what you would say.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.633
-What?
-I'm sorry.

07:11.700 --> 07:16.900
It's just the idea of Miles wanting
to try your cupcakes.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.633
Why is that funny?

07:18.700 --> 07:20.133
No offense, Dorothy,

07:20.200 --> 07:23.300
but your cupcakes
are dry and tasteless.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.867
Nobody ever
likes your cupcakes.

07:28.934 --> 07:32.233
My cupcakes are moist and delicious.

07:33.934 --> 07:37.233
Men love my cupcakes.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.900
Get a clue, Dorothy.

07:38.967 --> 07:41.700
Men would rather
pay for cupcakes.

07:43.266 --> 07:46.633
Let me tell you something,
you Swedish meatball.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.333
I've... wait. Wait a minute.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.000
You're actually talking
about cupcakes, aren't you?

07:54.066 --> 07:55.533
You bet I'm talking
about cupcakes.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.367
What are you talking about?

07:57.433 --> 08:02.400
Have you and Miles been...
baking together?

08:05.066 --> 08:07.000
Rose, I would never
do that to you.

08:07.066 --> 08:08.200
I swear.

08:08.266 --> 08:11.433
Good. If
I ever caught Miles

08:11.500 --> 08:13.700
with another woman
in my kitchen, I'd...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.133
Oh, Dorothy,
it's finally happened.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.266
I have met the man of my dreams,

08:25.333 --> 08:28.000
my reason for living,
my soul mate.

08:28.066 --> 08:31.033
I feel as if I've known him
for all eternity.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.834
Oh, honey.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.500
What is his name?

08:34.567 --> 08:37.000
Derek... something.

08:39.367 --> 08:42.734
Oh, Dorothy, he's so classy.
He's English.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.900
You know what that means.

08:43.967 --> 08:48.033
You've completed your "men
of western Europe" collection.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.934
You're not going
to spoil this for me.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.333
He is perfect.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.033
He just takes my breath away.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.066
Oh, my gosh.

08:56.133 --> 08:57.800
My Grammy's necklace is gone.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.000
I'll bet it slipped off when I was
showing Derek the view.

09:02.066 --> 09:04.000
Blanche, we don't have a view.

09:04.066 --> 09:06.200
Speak for yourself.

09:06.266 --> 09:08.133
(doorbell rings)

09:10.800 --> 09:12.600
Sophia,
I'm very angry with you.

09:12.667 --> 09:13.867
Not now, Barbara.

09:13.934 --> 09:16.467
I got to find Rose
and tell her something.

09:16.533 --> 09:19.800
Did you just tell my sister
I betrayed her?

09:19.867 --> 09:23.934
I had to get rid of her.
She's a nut, you know.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.667
You see it too?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.533
That's why I was angry

09:28.600 --> 09:31.633
when she told me about that thing
she'd done to you.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.100
What thing?

09:33.166 --> 09:34.033
You know.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.300
No, I don't.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.700
I think you do.

09:37.767 --> 09:40.700
-She wasn't the one--
-She joked about it.

09:41.967 --> 09:45.700
I laughed because
I had to play along.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.600
I don't hate you. I hate her.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.567
I'll get her back
if it's the last thing I do.

09:54.233 --> 09:57.233
Maybe the paper boy's right.
I'm just a mean old lady.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.100
Is there something
wrong here?

10:01.166 --> 10:04.667
-That woman is impossible.
-The man is a cretin.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.033
Dorothy?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.367
Miles?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.633
Dorothy!

10:13.367 --> 10:14.967
Sophia, I don't believe this.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.000
What's wrong, Blanche?

10:16.066 --> 10:18.367
It's Derek. He's gone.

10:18.433 --> 10:21.367
What's more, nobody here
has seen him or even knows him.

10:21.433 --> 10:25.166
And what's worse,
I think he stole my necklace.

10:25.233 --> 10:28.433
Can it be that his sweet words
meant nothing,

10:28.500 --> 10:30.734
that he was just
after my jewelry?

10:30.800 --> 10:33.734
A terrible thing
has happened,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.800
but when life does something
like this to you,

10:35.867 --> 10:39.900
there are some things to remember,
you got your health, right?

10:39.967 --> 10:41.100
Yeah.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.700
You can still walk.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.967
That's true.

10:44.033 --> 10:46.367
Great. Go get me some water.

10:49.433 --> 10:53.300
(mellow music playing)

10:55.266 --> 10:58.333
Oh, I hate him.
God, do I hate him.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.000
Not only did he steal
my necklace,

11:00.066 --> 11:02.333
but he betrayed my trust.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.767
Oh, please, God, let him get
caught. Let him go to jail.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.300
Let him rot and die
in some filthy cell

11:10.367 --> 11:12.834
with the rats gnawing at his eyes.

11:15.033 --> 11:16.767
You know, when you pray

11:16.834 --> 11:19.900
the kitchen almost
becomes a chapel.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.800
He made me think he was
attracted to me, Dorothy.

11:25.867 --> 11:27.900
He deserves the electric chair.

11:27.967 --> 11:32.033
That'd shock the smirk
right off his smug, limey face.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.033
Blanche, what if he didn't
steal the necklace?

11:35.533 --> 11:37.800
Well, then we'll
probably get married.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.133
Miles, you have
to talk to Dorothy.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.734
Rose, I can't.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.767
I want to know what
you're fighting about.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.266
It's no big deal.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.066
This doesn't involve you.

11:51.133 --> 11:54.800
No one's leaving this kitchen
until someone tells the truth.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.467
-I'll tell you.
-Miles!

11:56.533 --> 12:00.533
Dorothy... stole $500 from me.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.133
You liar!

12:04.200 --> 12:07.100
Just stop it, both of you.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.066
We're all friends here,

12:09.133 --> 12:10.433
and there are going to be times

12:10.500 --> 12:14.100
when we accidentally
hurt one another,

12:14.166 --> 12:17.633
and there are going to be times
when we accidentally

12:17.700 --> 12:20.367
steal large sums of money.

12:20.433 --> 12:22.300
I didn't!

12:22.367 --> 12:24.633
I want to see you two kiss
and make up.

12:27.734 --> 12:29.066
This is silly, Rose.

12:29.133 --> 12:30.133
Just do it.

12:49.433 --> 12:54.000
Rose, thank God I found you.
Don't try to stop me.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.734
This curse is bigger
than both of us.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.300
Well, bigger than me.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.867
I'm only doing this
because I love you.

13:00.934 --> 13:02.467
What is it, Sophia?

13:03.600 --> 13:06.000
I saw Dorothy
and Miles kissing.

13:08.667 --> 13:12.734
I said I saw Dorothy, your friend,
and Miles, your fiancé, kissing.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.166
Hello.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.967
Dorothy, Miles, lips aflame.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.500
They were kissing.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.500
And?

13:21.567 --> 13:24.767
And she's pregnant with his love
child. What do you mean, and?

13:26.834 --> 13:28.700
Isn't that enough?
Aren't you shocked?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.333
Not really.
I saw them kiss.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.967
It's no big deal, Sophia.

13:35.033 --> 13:37.533
In fact,
I think it solved everything.

13:40.934 --> 13:45.133
Well, Ma, you must be glad
that we're finished with the curse.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.233
I revealed a betrayal,
and she didn't even cry.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.367
It was more fun
tripping the rabbi.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.233
Is he still here?

13:56.133 --> 13:59.300
Excuse me.
Blanche Devereaux?

13:59.367 --> 14:00.734
I'm Blanche Devereaux.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.700
My pet, there's been
a terrible mistake.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.000
This gentleman thinks
I stole your car.

14:06.066 --> 14:07.934
You stole my car?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.400
Borrowed, precious.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.800
That's his story,

14:10.867 --> 14:13.934
but I know what happens
with older folks like yourself.

14:15.066 --> 14:20.000
Guy comes to the door, he talks
too fast, you get confused.

14:20.066 --> 14:22.467
You'd think they'd have more
respect for senior citizens.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.934
I lent him the car.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.633
Oh, come on, Blanche,
you have to admit

14:28.700 --> 14:32.633
when you get to our age there
are people who can outwit us.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.100
I gave him the car.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.200
I knew what I was doing.

14:35.266 --> 14:37.166
A tossed salad
could outwit you, Rose.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.834
Well, if you say
you know this fella,

14:40.900 --> 14:43.033
I guess it's all right.
Good night.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.133
Well, Derek?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.633
Darling, I can explain.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.700
A tossed salad can outwit me?

14:49.767 --> 14:52.600
Will someone please tell me
what that's supposed to mean?

14:54.900 --> 14:57.166
Perhaps I should explain privately.

15:03.033 --> 15:05.233
I cannot believe this. I just can't.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.967
I give you four of the best hours
of my life...

15:09.367 --> 15:11.300
and this is the thanks I get.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.467
-Darling, I can explain.
-Oh, you've disappointed me.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.700
You've lost my trust,

15:15.767 --> 15:18.734
and when a man loses the trust
of Blanche Devereaux,

15:18.800 --> 15:21.467
well, let's just say

15:21.533 --> 15:25.700
I have a list of things I will
not do with guys I don't trust.

15:27.400 --> 15:33.333
Admittedly, it's a short list, but
I bet all your favorites are on it.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.000
Blanche, you must listen.

15:35.066 --> 15:36.533
How could you have done this?

15:36.600 --> 15:40.800
Blanche, I'm a thief.
Actually, I was a thief.

15:40.867 --> 15:43.567
As I was driving away
this evening in your car,

15:43.633 --> 15:45.734
oh, for shame!

15:45.800 --> 15:48.300
I suddenly thought,
"What am I doing?"

15:48.367 --> 15:49.867
For a few paltry jewels,

15:49.934 --> 15:52.633
I'm throwing away
the greatest jewel of all.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.633
Oh, come on,
what's on the list?

15:57.700 --> 15:59.467
Not so fast.

15:59.533 --> 16:03.033
Let's just wait till you're
completely rehabilitated,

16:03.100 --> 16:04.767
which can be fun too.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.767
Well, let me start
my rehabilitation

16:07.834 --> 16:10.867
by giving you back
your lovely necklace.

16:10.934 --> 16:12.300
Thank you.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.166
And your ankle bracelet.

16:17.066 --> 16:18.133
Thank you.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.533
And your signet ring.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.533
That isn't mine.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.200
Oh, well, then we're square.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.033
(soft music playing)

16:32.100 --> 16:33.000
Blanche, you were right.

16:33.066 --> 16:35.333
What do we have without trust?

16:35.400 --> 16:38.433
Because with trust,
anything is possible.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.100
Anything.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.567
Not to be overly cautious,
but I'll go put these in the safe.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.166
I understand.

16:45.667 --> 16:46.734
There's a safe?

16:49.433 --> 16:52.633
So, you're Blanche's thief.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.200
Blanche... remarkable woman.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.567
I've known her
just this evening,

16:58.633 --> 17:00.433
and she's already
reformed me.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.700
The result of her benevolence,
I shall steal no more.

17:03.767 --> 17:05.533
Boy, I don't envy you.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.900
My friends in the work force

17:06.967 --> 17:10.300
say this is no easy time
to be changing careers.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.600
Those are lovely earrings
you're wearing.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.433
Thank you.
They're family heirlooms.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.367
They're worth more than
your lazy-ass husband

17:22.433 --> 17:24.467
will make in a lifetime.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.800
At least, that's how mom
used to describe them to me.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.767
Rose, has anyone
ever told you

17:33.834 --> 17:38.000
your eyes are as blue as
the Mediterranean in summer?

17:38.066 --> 17:39.367
No.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.133
I've been warned if I cross them,
they'll stay that way.

17:45.100 --> 17:49.967
Or that your lips are as luscious
as red raspberries in fall?

17:50.033 --> 17:52.300
I love raspberries.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.567
Or that your fragrance,

17:53.633 --> 17:56.333
oh, my God,
your fragrance drives a man

17:56.400 --> 17:59.367
to the absolute limit
of his self-control?

17:59.433 --> 18:00.767
Mmm.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.433
(doorbell rings)

18:22.133 --> 18:27.667
Oh, Lord, I act like a bad girl
once in my life, and I get caught.

18:27.734 --> 18:30.600
We ran a make on
your gentleman friend.

18:30.667 --> 18:33.333
He's wanted for jewel theft
in four states.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.667
He'll have to
come with me.

18:35.734 --> 18:36.867
He's not a thief.

18:36.934 --> 18:40.600
He's a thoroughly changed
man. See for yourself.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.834
He's... gone.

18:47.133 --> 18:50.300
Ma, I'm scared.
The curse isn't over.

18:50.367 --> 18:51.900
Dorothy, you don't have
to rationalize to me.

18:51.967 --> 18:54.734
You want more wine?
Take it.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.500
I feel guiltier than ever.

18:56.567 --> 18:59.166
I didn't tell a friend the truth.

18:59.233 --> 19:00.834
Rose doesn't
need to find out.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.400
Let's move along
with our lives.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.033
Let it go, pussycat.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.967
I'm sorry, Ma,
I don't like to keep secrets.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.100
Like when you
kept the secret

19:09.166 --> 19:11.967
you were taking me
to Shady Pines?

19:12.033 --> 19:16.233
Ma, I swear, I didn't sleep more
than seven hours that night.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.367
I'm telling Rose.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.433
She'll think I'm hiding it.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.367
-Well, you are.
-Only because you were.

19:23.433 --> 19:26.133
I'll tell her first.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.934
What difference does it make
who tells her first?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.467
This isn't for our good.
It's for her good.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.333
Let's just tell her.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.400
Let me tell her first, and
I'll forget about the $500.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.066
That's a lie!

19:43.300 --> 19:47.800
I'm a bad girl.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.467
Rose.

19:49.533 --> 19:52.066
She's a bad girl.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.734
Rose, we have to talk.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.066
-Please sit down.
-I don't deserve to sit.

19:57.133 --> 19:59.133
What are you
talking about?

19:59.200 --> 20:01.166
Dorothy, you can't
see my dark side

20:01.233 --> 20:04.166
because you're good,
and good can't see evil.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.900
No, no. I'm the evil one.

20:06.967 --> 20:09.033
I kissed Miles.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.200
I know. I saw you.

20:11.266 --> 20:12.567
No. Before that.

20:12.633 --> 20:15.700
It was earlier...
and longer.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.800
Rose, it just happened.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.667
Evil took over my lips.
I feel so guilty.

20:20.734 --> 20:22.100
We both do.

20:22.166 --> 20:25.767
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard.

20:25.834 --> 20:29.233
Feeling guilty for sharing
a little kiss with a friend?

20:29.300 --> 20:30.800
See? She's right.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.233
There's nothing wrong
with kissing a friend.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.900
Or a stranger.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.934
Who knows
why we acted like we did?

20:42.667 --> 20:44.000
We?

20:44.066 --> 20:45.667
Let me finish.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.500
Miles, maybe you did it

20:48.567 --> 20:51.533
because you're just a little nervous
about us getting married.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.767
Well, I am a little.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.867
That's because
we're rushing into it

20:55.934 --> 21:00.533
for some free honeymoon,
not because we're ready.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.667
And, Dorothy, maybe subconsciously,

21:03.734 --> 21:05.066
you were trying
to block my marriage

21:05.133 --> 21:07.133
because you like
me living here.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.633
Ok.

21:11.033 --> 21:15.100
Sophia, maybe you wanted to tell
me about Miles and Dorothy kissing

21:15.166 --> 21:16.567
because you're just
a mean old woman

21:16.633 --> 21:18.567
like the paper boy said.

21:24.233 --> 21:25.367
Ok.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.166
Where's Derek?

21:32.233 --> 21:33.500
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.834
The police came for him,
and he ran away.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.967
He's gone? Gone again?

21:38.033 --> 21:39.567
Are you all right, Blanche?

21:39.633 --> 21:41.333
Oh, yeah.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.367
Yeah, I guess I'm all right.

21:43.433 --> 21:46.133
I threw my party because I wanted
romance and excitement

21:46.200 --> 21:49.467
and moonlight madness,
and that's what I got.

21:49.533 --> 21:52.900
I got it all,
with an English accent,

21:52.967 --> 21:55.100
and I didn't have
to compromise my virtue.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.033
I feel like a lady again.

21:59.033 --> 22:01.900
And to tell you the truth,
I'm starting to get sick of it.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.066
What a night.

22:06.133 --> 22:09.400
Doesn't it feel as though
we just woke from a dream?

22:09.467 --> 22:12.166
You know, it really has been
like Shakespeare,

22:12.233 --> 22:18.033
with magic and moonlight and
the wrong people falling in love.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.166
What does Puck say
in the last speech

22:21.233 --> 22:24.100
from <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream?</i>

22:24.166 --> 22:28.166
"If we shadows have offended,
think but this,

22:28.233 --> 22:30.166
and all is mended,

22:30.233 --> 22:35.700
that you have but slumbered here
while these visions did appear,

22:35.767 --> 22:40.066
and this weak and idle theme
no more yielding...

22:41.333 --> 22:42.700
but a dream."

22:44.600 --> 22:48.367
Well, pardon me
while I play the grand piano.

22:57.867 --> 23:02.066
(theme music playing)
