about him every minute.

11:18.926 --> 11:21.310
I think she likes you.

11:21.312 --> 11:22.394
Jealous?

11:22.396 --> 11:23.762
Don't flatter yourself.

11:27.852 --> 11:30.102

11:30.104 --> 11:31.770
Little late in the season for mosquitoes.

11:37.912 --> 11:40.029

11:40.031 --> 11:41.580
Nothing.

11:49.090 --> 11:52.875
<i>the more misery we just spread in our wake,</i>

11:52.877 --> 11:57.379
<i>because it seems like
everywhere me and my sister go,</i>

11:57.381 --> 11:59.265
<i>bad things are never far behind.</i>

12:07.475 --> 12:08.557

Open your mouth and I'll kill you.

What do you want?

12:36.804 --> 12:39.221
Your daddy's disappointed in ya.

13:02.363 --> 13:03.912
You can't even take care of yourself.

13:03.914 --> 13:05.664
You know it's true.

13:05.666 --> 13:06.832
Just admit it.

You're a burden.

13:08.536 --> 13:11.453
Everywhere you go, everything you do.

Maybe she'd be better off

Guard. Guard! Guard!

Abascal.

Is there a problem?

Who you talking to?

Uh, no one.

13:34.862 --> 13:38.030
Come on. You got a visitor.

13:47.575 --> 13:49.291
You had me worried.

<i>I'm telling you, that dope wasn't mine.</i>

13:50.661 --> 13:52.544
<i>The sheriff planted it.</i>

- David...

We don't know anything

<i>I'm not the one in jail.</i>

14:04.842 --> 14:06.058
You're right.

14:06.060 --> 14:07.509
I let you down.

14:07.511 --> 14:08.677
Don't worry about me.

14:08.679 --> 14:09.895
Just go.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.563
You have to get out of Charleston.

14:11.565 --> 14:14.099
As long as you're here, no one is safe.

<i>That's right, David.</i>

<i>Just let her go.</i>

Tetra, don't you let my
beautiful little Gracie

15:48.325 --> 15:49.624
work too hard.

15:49.626 --> 15:51.710
She's in good hands, Reverend.

15:51.712 --> 15:53.044
It's good to have you back, sweetheart.

15:54.414 --> 15:56.631
I made a room for you upstairs.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.250
<i>Best view in the whole place.</i>

16:00.554 --> 16:02.420
Can I get you anything?

16:02.422 --> 16:04.506
Soda pop?

16:04.508 --> 16:07.142
No, thank you.

16:07.144 --> 16:10.178
If you get hungry, Tetra
will take you to Frogmore's.

16:10.180 --> 16:12.847
- What's that?
- It's a diner at the flea market.

16:12.849 --> 16:14.766
Best fish stew in town.

16:14.768 --> 16:16.568
I work there most nights.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.938
Looking after the church
only pays half the bills.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.944
I'll, uh, see you later, sweetheart.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.084
You okay?

16:38.508 --> 16:40.792
I just never thought
I'd see a man like my dad

16:40.794 --> 16:43.294
living in a place like this.

16:47.217 --> 16:49.851
Lord, thank you for
bringing back my daughter,

16:49.853 --> 16:54.105
but I have one more favor to ask.

16:54.107 --> 16:58.143
Don't let her find out the truth.

17:06.486 --> 17:09.037
<i>We all have to satisfy our demons,</i>

17:09.039 --> 17:12.741
<i>and it's been too long
since I've tended to mine.</i>

17:12.742 --> 17:15.126
<i>The longer without a fix,</i>

17:15.127 --> 17:18.163
<i>the harder it is to tell what's real</i>

17:18.165 --> 17:20.915
<i>or just a nightmare.</i>

17:20.916 --> 17:23.385
<i>Or if there's even a difference anymore.</i>

17:31.561 --> 17:33.728
<i>Death only hurts for a moment, David,</i>

17:33.730 --> 17:35.930
<i>but it sets you free forever.</i>

<i>[women screaming]</i>

17:55.285 --> 17:59.120

18:06.463 --> 18:08.430
Pretty meager pickings.

18:08.432 --> 18:10.632
- This all you got?
- It's a moving sale.

18:10.634 --> 18:12.634
All the deals are final.

18:12.636 --> 18:14.052
I got this.

18:15.439 --> 18:16.855
You might like that.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.476
What's the provenance?

18:21.478 --> 18:23.561
Family heirloom.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.530
Paste?

18:25.532 --> 18:27.866
It's real diamonds.

18:27.868 --> 18:29.567
I'm not crazy about the setting.

18:29.569 --> 18:31.870
Henrietta, it's my
mother's engagement ring.

18:31.872 --> 18:33.621
Don't break my balls on this one.

18:33.623 --> 18:34.823
It's hard enough.

18:34.825 --> 18:36.374
I'll give you 500.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.043
I can get two grand on eBay.

18:39.045 --> 18:40.578
- Then do that.
- Can I see that?

18:43.333 --> 18:44.749
Nice round shape.

18:44.751 --> 18:46.835
Good dispersion.

18:46.837 --> 18:48.419
It's at least two karats.

18:48.421 --> 18:49.888
I've give you 2,500.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.222
Too late.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.258
She and I already agreed on 2,000.

18:56.096 --> 18:57.562
It's all there, honey.

19:01.935 --> 19:03.434
Thanks, Dusty.

19:03.436 --> 19:04.853
You don't have that kind of money.

19:04.855 --> 19:07.489
She doesn't know that.

19:07.491 --> 19:10.358
I really appreciate what you did there.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.910
You're a pretty good con.

19:11.912 --> 19:13.828
Oh, let's just say I'm helping a friend.

19:13.830 --> 19:15.997
I knew you fixed doors, but I
didn't know you knew diamonds.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.415
Play chess, too.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.084
I'm a man of many talents.

19:20.086 --> 19:21.619
I'm sorry. I'm really late.

19:21.621 --> 19:24.372
- I got to get going.
- I'll see you later?

19:24.374 --> 19:27.292
Um, I'd like to, but, uh...

19:30.380 --> 19:32.046
Yeah, I'll... I'll come by later.

19:32.048 --> 19:33.464
All right.

19:38.939 --> 19:43.725
<i>Most everybody in Charleston

19:48.815 --> 19:51.983
<i>The woman with a face like an angel.</i>

19:51.985 --> 19:55.453

19:55.455 --> 19:57.789
[sighs] I don't know.

20:03.797 --> 20:06.164
I feel so... trapped,

20:06.166 --> 20:09.250
like I don't belong here.

20:11.087 --> 20:14.556
Oh, Gracie. [sighs]

20:14.558 --> 20:18.259
You know, you remind me so
much of myself sometimes.

20:21.314 --> 20:23.598
Your father told me what happened to you.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.435
What was it like having that
kind of power inside you?

20:27.437 --> 20:29.270
It wasn't power.

20:29.272 --> 20:30.772
It was evil.

20:30.774 --> 20:33.024
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

20:33.026 --> 20:36.911
I just want you to be happy.

20:36.913 --> 20:40.365
How do I do that here?

20:40.367 --> 20:42.500
I'm gonna show you something
my mother used to do

20:42.502 --> 20:43.835
to make me smile.

20:43.837 --> 20:45.203
Okay?

20:46.456 --> 20:50.041
You just grab a scarf, like this.

20:54.347 --> 20:55.713
Then just spread your wings.

20:59.185 --> 21:00.551
Come on, you try it.

21:02.939 --> 21:04.305
It's easy.

[clearing throats]

21:15.869 --> 21:17.986
[chuckles] There you go.

21:17.988 --> 21:19.570

<i>[door opens]</i>

21:34.387 --> 21:36.254
David, I got the bail money.

All rise for the honorable Judge Culland.

21:55.608 --> 21:57.241
Ah, what'd we catch today?

22:00.497 --> 22:03.247
<i>David Paul Abascal.</i>

<i>Possession of narcotics, resisting arrest.</i>

22:08.004 --> 22:10.038
Your Honor, my client pleads not guilty.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.956
We'd like to post bail.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.876
Larceny by trick, breaking and entering,

22:14.878 --> 22:18.179
<i>receipt of stolen property from
the Roberts home on the 14th.</i>

22:18.181 --> 22:20.515
Your Honor, no one informed to me...

22:20.517 --> 22:23.301
<i>Transient lifestyle, no employment records.</i>

22:23.303 --> 22:25.803
If he's not a legitimate
flight risk, who is?

22:25.805 --> 22:27.388
He's innocent,

22:27.390 --> 22:28.973
and if you have a problem
with me and my family,

22:28.975 --> 22:30.725
then you have no right
to preside over his case.

22:30.727 --> 22:32.894
You sit down or I'll hold you in contempt.

22:34.731 --> 22:36.447
Maria, it's okay.

22:36.449 --> 22:39.701
Mr. Abascal, I'll take
your plea of not guilty

22:39.703 --> 22:41.069
and we'll go to trial.

22:41.071 --> 22:42.954
The bail is set at $40,000.

22:42.956 --> 22:44.906
You can't do that.

22:44.908 --> 22:47.325
Bailiff, remove that woman.

22:47.327 --> 22:50.411
Don't even bother.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.129
You just don't know when you quit, do you?

23:02.131 --> 23:04.215
Don't do it. Please.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.050
What happened back in your boy's exorcism

23:06.052 --> 23:08.385
has nothing to do with my brother's case.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.642
You and your brother are
a couple of con artists,

23:14.644 --> 23:16.227
and if I'd known who your father was,

23:16.229 --> 23:18.562
I never would have let
you step foot in my house.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.231
- You finished?
- My boy's worse now

23:20.233 --> 23:22.066
than he was after you pulled
your little hokum hustle.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.401
Demons return for a reason.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.487
Pain, fear, trauma.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.073
The kind that comes from getting
beat up on by your stepdad.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.242
Be careful.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.661
Enos is targeting you.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.212
You were the DA who signed the warrant

23:35.214 --> 23:36.831
for the Feds to raid his compound.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.916
That's right, and Enos is dead. He's dead.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.085
You really think that's enough to stop him?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.920
After everything you've seen?

23:42.922 --> 23:45.055
This is how Enos works.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.591
He uses people you know
to do his dirty work.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.894
Puts the devil in 'em
and gets closer and closer

23:49.896 --> 23:52.930
until he kills his target, and that's you.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.853
You can get that thing out of him?

23:58.855 --> 24:00.938
If you drop the charges against David.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.111
You fix that boy for good this time,

24:07.113 --> 24:09.163
then we'll talk about your brother.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.539
About damn time.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.040
- I'm ready for some action.
- This isn't about...

24:20.042 --> 24:21.542
Jeremy's demon was lucky that last round,

24:21.544 --> 24:23.093
but I'll take him out this time.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.628
Why are you still helping me?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.931
You know what happens
to you if we stop Enos.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.966
I have no intention of stopping him,

24:28.968 --> 24:30.885
and you're the one helping me.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.313
So, what are we waiting for?

24:42.315 --> 24:43.614
That demon is the only thing

24:43.616 --> 24:45.616
protecting that little
boy from that sadist.

24:45.618 --> 24:48.068
If we take it out now,
Jeremy will be defenseless

24:48.070 --> 24:49.987
and what's to stop the
judge from killing him?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.790
If you don't take it out now,
then it's only a matter of time

24:52.792 --> 24:56.660
before that thing kills
Daddy and sweet little Mom

24:56.662 --> 24:58.829
and steals away that little boy's soul.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.297
That's a lot of blood.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.583
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

David.

39:45.862 --> 39:48.413
Oh, my God. I was so worried about you.

39:48.415 --> 39:50.948
It's my job to worry about you, remember?

39:52.919 --> 39:55.453
I don't know what you did, but thanks.

39:59.175 --> 40:00.625
You still hitting the road in the morning?

40:02.212 --> 40:04.011
You're clean.

40:04.013 --> 40:07.215
I'm trying.

40:38.248 --> 40:40.248
No. I'm perfect.

I've seen you walking out of

Well, you're welcome to
come by any time you like.

40:48.091 --> 40:50.675
Just might do that, ma'am.

Enjoy your evening, ma'am.
