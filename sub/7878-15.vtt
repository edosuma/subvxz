You guys ready?

00:34.334 --> 00:36.135
Oh, I don't know, Snot.

00:36.169 --> 00:39.038
A whole week of working after
school on your uncle's farm?

00:39.072 --> 00:40.706
Steve, we promised him.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.342
And you know he can't afford
a professional crew.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.643
Plus, it's a mitzvah.

00:44.677 --> 00:45.744
What's a mitzvah?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.846
A mitt's fah catching
a baseball!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.815
Yacka-yacka-yacka!

00:49.849 --> 00:51.450
Ehh?

00:51.484 --> 00:53.452
There's a smile.

00:53.486 --> 00:55.454
Come on! We'll
all be together!

00:55.488 --> 00:57.623
What could be more
fun than that?

00:57.657 --> 00:59.825
Oh, my God.

00:59.859 --> 01:03.062
It's all the cool kids.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.096
Yeah! Who wants
to be us?!

01:06.699 --> 01:09.902
Let's go surf and mountain-bike
and explore each other's bodies!

01:09.936 --> 01:12.471
Oh, yeah!

01:12.505 --> 01:16.308
Aw, man, can you imagine what
it's like to be one of <i>them?</i>

01:16.342 --> 01:19.912
Yeah! Who wants
to be us?!

01:19.946 --> 01:23.582
Let's go surf and mountain-bike
and explore each other's bodies!

01:23.616 --> 01:25.984
Oh, yeah!

01:29.689 --> 01:31.623
Oh...

01:31.658 --> 01:33.559
Well, howdy, boychicks.

01:33.593 --> 01:37.262
You're real mensches to help me
bring in this year's cabbage crop.

01:41.134 --> 01:44.036
Well, as you know, Yom
Kippur's on the horizon,

01:44.070 --> 01:47.739
and temples everywhere are
predicting a robust break fast.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.710
Now, this here cabbage'll supply
every Jew on the eastern seaboard

01:51.744 --> 01:54.113
with the delicious
coleslaw they crave.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.147
Any questions?

01:55.181 --> 01:56.415
Do dolphins sleep?

01:56.449 --> 01:58.217
They are mammals,
and they do sleep.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.952
Schmuely, you're one
heck of a nephew,

01:59.986 --> 02:02.154
and you got a great
group of friends here.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.455
The best!

02:03.490 --> 02:05.157
And you're
the best of the best

02:05.191 --> 02:06.758
of the best, Steve.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.993
Thanks, bud.

02:08.026 --> 02:11.196
I think Toshi can hear us.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.801
Hey, babe. Back from my
mission in New Brunswick.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.369
Honey! Welcome home.

02:17.403 --> 02:18.670
Surprise!

02:18.705 --> 02:21.740
Oh, my God.
A decorative spoon.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.442
You didn't even open it.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.445
Oh, my God.
A decorative spoon.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.514
Do you love it?
You collect them.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.482
No. I <i>have</i> a collection,

02:30.517 --> 02:32.751
because you bring me one
from every mission.

02:32.785 --> 02:36.021
Well, just tell me what you
<i>want</i> to collect, and I'll...

02:36.055 --> 02:37.856
You're... you're crying.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.725
What's
the matta, ya hungry?

02:39.759 --> 02:42.728
I know you mean well,
but I feel like there's

02:42.762 --> 02:45.063
just no more surprises
in our marriage.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.331
Oh, God. Oh, no.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.766
This is a problem.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.602
Honey, mark this date:
the day I vow to return

02:50.637 --> 02:52.571
the element of surprise
to our marriage.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.139
Oh, Stan.

02:55.308 --> 02:56.775
Oh! Farted
during a hug.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.477
Hey, that's kind of a surprise.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.846
No, it's... kind of not.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.785
All these people
walking around without bags.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.555
Buy something!
You're killing this mall!

03:09.589 --> 03:11.089
How's your pretzel?

03:11.124 --> 03:12.925
Good. I brought
it from home.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.227
Oh, look at those nerd bombs.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.763
Probably gonna use that fabric

03:17.797 --> 03:19.565
to make each other
wizard cloaks.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.567
What is that, about a yard?

03:21.601 --> 03:23.702
Wow! Yeah,
it is about a yard.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.804
They'll never be cool.

03:25.838 --> 03:28.473
You're either born cool,
or you're not.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.908
I don't know about that.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.244
I'm pretty sure I can
make anybody cool.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.813
Oh, <i>ja?</i> One dollar
says you can't make

03:34.847 --> 03:37.716
the next loser up
the escalator into a cool.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.585
You got yourself a bet.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.623
Damn it, you saw him coming.

03:44.657 --> 03:45.791
Touché.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.059
You're using that wrong.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.328
Yes...

03:49.362 --> 03:52.497
It's fine. I mean, how hard
could it be to make Steve cool?

03:52.532 --> 03:54.066
Oh, my God!

03:54.100 --> 03:55.767
Pals that I know!

03:55.802 --> 03:57.002
Hello, pals!

03:57.036 --> 03:59.504
I'm here to get
my eyeglasses adjusted!

04:00.840 --> 04:02.941
Hey, you got Gummi Bears
in your ears?

04:02.976 --> 04:04.643
I said hello.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.348
Hey, Smith, I got to get ready
for my party tomorrow night,

04:09.382 --> 04:11.383
so I don't have time
to pick on you.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.918
No problem...
I'll pick on myself.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.286
Thanks, man.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.954
Front wedgie!

04:19.524 --> 04:21.627
Aah! I smell my butt!

04:21.661 --> 04:24.096
Last time I heard that,
I was holding a finger

04:24.130 --> 04:26.098
under the fat
Kardashian's nose.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.100
Roger?
Name's Josh Bycel.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.002
Transfer student
from the poor part

04:30.036 --> 04:31.670
of Santa Barb...
... ara.

04:31.704 --> 04:33.338
I'm here to make you cool.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.274
What do <i>you</i> know
about being cool?

04:35.308 --> 04:36.808
Yo, Bycel!

04:36.843 --> 04:38.176
What up, Berland?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.712
Tell your sister I'm
gonna put a baby in her.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.180
Put one in me.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.283
You wish.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.518
So, what do you say, Steve,
you want to be cool?

04:46.552 --> 04:50.255
Oh, I don't know. Would the guys at
REI rather be camping right now?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.990
Yeah, I want to be cool.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.993
But that big dream is not
for little Steve Smith.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.497
Hey.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.932
Hey, sweet bird, look at me.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.934
I <i>will</i> make you cool.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.936
You really think
you can, Roger?

05:04.971 --> 05:05.971
I know it.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.806
Hey, this feels good.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.308
Do you like it?

05:09.342 --> 05:10.742
Don't tell anyone.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.078
You'll get in trouble, too.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.253
Gotcha!

05:21.287 --> 05:22.821
Oh, that is terrific!

05:22.855 --> 05:24.656
What the hell are you doing?!

05:24.691 --> 05:26.358
Surprising you,
like you wanted.

05:26.392 --> 05:29.328
I was talking about
a romantic surprise.

05:29.362 --> 05:32.030
Like flowers
or a nice dinner out.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.532
Oh, boy.
I misunderstood.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.367
Don't feel bad that
you didn't explain yourself

05:35.401 --> 05:36.735
as well as you should have.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.403
Giving me a heart attack.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.072
Almost broke my damn neck.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.306
I'm really sorry.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.541
Now I know.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.743
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.446
And that's a skier's promise.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.550
Your undies are on the lamp.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.685
Oh, no, oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

05:53.720 --> 05:56.355
no, those-those are mine.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.362
Okay, the easiest
way to be cool:

06:03.396 --> 06:05.564
be the guy with
the big kielbasa.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.700
Size 14 high-tops
and a thick, spicy one.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.903
Slip these on, and
I'll slip this... in.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.841
Mm! Look at that bulge.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.344
Mm! Best part of waking up
is Bulgers in your cup.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.948
Mm! Now, go wag that mama
all over school, cool guy.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:55.281 --> 06:56.314
Easy, boy.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.186
All right, new plan.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.822
You're gonna be...
the tough guy.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.457
Ooh.
Now,

07:05.541 --> 07:07.526
you're one of
the biggest wimps in school,

07:07.560 --> 07:09.661
so you have to find
somebody even wimpier

07:09.695 --> 07:12.597
<i>and just kick... their... ass.</i>

07:12.632 --> 07:14.366
Oh, hi, Steve.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.134
How are...
Yeah! What?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.136
It's Steve's hallway!

07:18.171 --> 07:20.372
That guy hit
the super smart Indian girl

07:20.406 --> 07:22.007
who skipped several grades!

07:22.041 --> 07:23.608
How could he hit a girl?

07:23.643 --> 07:25.143
That's messed up.
No way. Reshma.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.578
That girl's nice to everyone!

07:26.612 --> 07:28.580
Hey! What's going
on out here?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.714
This guy hit Reshma.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.283
Hi...

07:31.317 --> 07:32.451
yah!

07:36.355 --> 07:38.857
Yeah.

07:41.427 --> 07:42.928
Didn't think I had to specify

07:42.962 --> 07:44.729
that you should kick
a <i>boy's</i> ass.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.399
Sorry. Don't apologize to
me; apologize to Reshma.

07:47.433 --> 07:48.900
Bitch is hysterical.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.268
Thanks for trying, Roger.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.170
I'm just not meant to be cool.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.371
I'm gonna turn in.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.475
I got to be at the
farm at sunrise.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.910
Roger, just admit defeat
and pay me my dollar.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.813
I want to go to Old Navy
and buy two pullovers.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.014
Not so fast.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.650
I have one last foolproof idea.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.753
Steve'll be the first kid
in his class to drive.

08:08.788 --> 08:11.990
He can't drive a car...
he's only 14.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.526
Know the rules
of the planet, dipstick.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.202
Guess who, dick?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.204
So, I read the DMV manual.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.074
The fish is right... you are
too young to drive a car.

08:29.108 --> 08:33.111
But there <i>is</i> something
a 14-year-old <i>can</i> drive.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.591
What up, bitches.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.566
Unless you're a ho,
close your mouth.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.235
That's right,
I got my farming license, son.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.237
First freshman to drive.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.574
Wow. Look at
Steve Smith, huh?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.312
Driving a tractor is so lame.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.514
Bycel, what are
you doing up there

09:09.549 --> 09:10.782
with the farmer's daughter?

09:10.816 --> 09:11.950
Uh... well...

09:11.984 --> 09:13.985
I couldn't hit him
from down there.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.056
What the hell?

09:18.090 --> 09:19.791
Sorry, can't ruin my rep.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.793
Don't worry,
I'll make it up to you

09:21.827 --> 09:24.195
right... now.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.463
Huh?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.933
Hurts less this time,
doesn't it?

09:30.536 --> 09:32.604
Steve. There you are.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.739
Where did you take the tractor?

09:34.774 --> 09:37.943
I took it for a joyride,
but there wasn't much joy.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.746
That's beautiful.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.048
Oy.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.483
Looks like we got some
freezing rain moving in.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.118
Crop won't survive the night.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.454
Then let's bring
this cabbage in.

09:49.488 --> 09:50.855
Now, hold on.

09:50.890 --> 09:54.326
Let me check,
make sure it's ripe and ready.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.298
You guys ready?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.133
So close.
Two, three hours, tops.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.135
But you got to leave us alone;

10:04.170 --> 10:06.171
you're stressing everybody out.

10:11.911 --> 10:15.046
Now, <i>this</i> is what
I'm talkin' 'bout.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.152
My man <i>love</i> me.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.569
Oh, my God.
I got you twice.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.504
Deuce. Deuce.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.007
I can't believe
you did that again.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.075
Had to.
By pretending I understood

10:44.110 --> 10:45.644
what kind of surprise
you wanted,

10:45.678 --> 10:47.112
I totally threw you off.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.015
Made you think I was gonna do
something romantic, then boom.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.717
How could you?

10:52.752 --> 10:55.954
Aw, baby, come on,
no, no, don't...

10:55.988 --> 10:58.590
don't... don't
ruin this for me.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.898
Chung, I'm opening one
of your dad's Petite Sirahs.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.301
Hey. Just want to know
if you're ready

11:10.336 --> 11:12.404
to admit defeat
and pay me my buck?

11:12.438 --> 11:13.805
What-What's that echo?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.106
Are you in the bathroom?

11:15.141 --> 11:16.341
No, I'm in the subway.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.742
Where do you think I am?

11:17.777 --> 11:19.010
I'm on the can.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.412
You got my money or not?

11:20.446 --> 11:22.113
No, because I'm
gonna win this bet.

11:25.484 --> 11:26.651
Nice!

11:26.686 --> 11:28.186
Ah, that wasn't for you.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.722
Hey, there's an even cooler
party across town.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.291
They've got pizza and two
golden retrievers you can pet.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.126
Let's get there.
Yeah, let's do it.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.928
Oh, man, golden retrievers
are so special.

11:36.962 --> 11:38.863
Is anybody sober
enough to drive?

11:38.898 --> 11:40.632
Nope!
I'm good.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.133
We'll take my Kawasaki.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.669
I'll-I'll-I'll
make 50 trips.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.841
Grab-Grab onto my waist.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.377
Kawasaki!

11:55.181 --> 11:56.514
Who's next?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.316
You're not okay to drive, bro.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.185
Man, if we could find a way

12:00.219 --> 12:03.922
to get 50 wasted people safely
across town, it'd be so cool.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.758
That gives me an idea.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.332
Someone order
a designated driver?

12:16.335 --> 12:17.502
Super cool.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.037
Let's get to the next party.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.272
Steve Smith's the man.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.640
You hear that Roger?

12:22.675 --> 12:24.409
I'm the man. You did it.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.478
No problem, buddy.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.281
What a mild night.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.476
Where'd she go?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.895
She usually starts dinner
at 6:00.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.018
Got you!

13:07.052 --> 13:08.853
How? You were...

13:08.888 --> 13:10.288
I saw you.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.323
Come on, it's funny.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.060
Ooh, ah. She got me.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.062
She got me good.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.370
Deuce! Deuce!

13:25.404 --> 13:27.372
Two times!

13:31.343 --> 13:34.145
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

13:34.180 --> 13:35.647
Yeah! Right on!

13:35.681 --> 13:37.048
Shut up!

13:37.082 --> 13:39.984
The only reason
I'm able to drink irresponsibly

13:40.019 --> 13:43.288
is 'cause of our designated
driver right here!

13:43.322 --> 13:46.758
Steve! Steve!
Steve! Steve! Steve!

13:46.792 --> 13:49.260
Hey!

13:57.269 --> 14:01.573
When these come in,
they're all yours.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.740
Oh, yeah!

14:02.775 --> 14:05.210
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:05.244 --> 14:07.612
Nice. About how long do
you think that'll take?

14:10.382 --> 14:13.084
I love how comfortable
you are with me.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.719
Ugh!

14:18.224 --> 14:20.358
He did it.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.527
Steve, Snot Lonstein again.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.362
Third message.
Hope you're well.

14:24.396 --> 14:27.599
Listen, you're kind of
us with this tractor thing, huh?

14:27.633 --> 14:30.435
So... call me back, okay?

14:30.469 --> 14:31.669
So?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.271
He didn't pick up.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.640
But I'm sure he'll bring
the tractor back before...

14:37.142 --> 14:38.343
...the rain.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.111
Uh-oh.

Hello, I am David.

I am new to the neighborhood.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.529
You've struck my garage,

16:38.564 --> 16:41.899
and I feel as though
we are not going to get along.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.969
Steve, tractor us to Taco King.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.771
Sure thing, Chung.

You the man, Smith!

16:49.274 --> 16:50.908
Eh!

16:54.747 --> 16:57.215
I lost my lens.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.983
Come on.
Let's go.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.685
Attention.

17:00.719 --> 17:02.687
I've lost a prescription lens.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.255
If everybody could
just link arms,

17:04.289 --> 17:06.290
we can do an Amish sweep.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.759
Oh, no!

17:07.792 --> 17:09.060
Sorry, everybody.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.095
I can't drive
without this lens.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.497
Not cool.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.798
To think, this summer,

17:13.832 --> 17:15.833
we were going to become
such good friends,

17:15.867 --> 17:18.136
I was going to tell
you my darkest secret.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.470
Something so
shocking and personal

17:19.505 --> 17:21.204
that it would have
bonded us forever.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.189
Snot!

17:38.223 --> 17:39.557
But h-how do you have...?

17:39.591 --> 17:42.126
We made a deal in the
fourth grade, remember?

17:42.161 --> 17:44.762
I always carry a
spare lens for you,

17:44.797 --> 17:48.199
and you always carry a
spare inhaler for me.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.500
You have it, right?

17:49.535 --> 17:51.803
Yeah, of course I do.

17:54.139 --> 17:56.140
Snot, why'd you come back?

17:56.175 --> 17:57.942
I was so horrible to you.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.511
Because friendship
is like a crop.

18:00.546 --> 18:03.247
There are good times
and bad times,

18:03.282 --> 18:05.283
fertile and frost,

18:05.317 --> 18:07.718
but you always have
to see it through.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.887
Even though
I hate you right now,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.689
you're still my friend.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.991
Snot, I'm sorry.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.360
How can I ever make this up
to you?

18:16.395 --> 18:19.497
You can do what any
good friend would do...

18:19.531 --> 18:23.601
help my Jewish farmer uncle
harvest his talking cabbage crop

18:23.635 --> 18:27.638
in time to make the coleslaw
for the Yom Kippur break fast.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.243
Let's ride.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.249
Francine.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.251
I am entering the house.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.487
Remember our truce?

18:42.521 --> 18:43.888
Are you in the house?

18:43.922 --> 18:45.656
I am in the house.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.459
I am standing in the kitchen.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.862
I am going
to enter the kitchen now.

18:50.896 --> 18:56.334
Okay. I understand you are going
to enter the kitchen now.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.770
I'm here, Francine.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.005
I see you.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.273
Ugh, I'm sorry, honey.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.809
It was stupid of me to think
that scaring you

19:04.843 --> 19:06.878
was the kind of surprise
our relationship needed.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.580
Well, I kind of got caught up
in it, too.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.182
I think I finally understand

19:11.216 --> 19:13.384
what sort of surprise
you're looking for.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.685
Something little.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.320
Chinese food?

19:16.355 --> 19:18.356
It's perfect, Stan.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.758
Let's eat.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.031
Did we do it, Stan?

19:27.065 --> 19:28.866
Did we scare her?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.301
We did it, little buddy.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.003
We scared her good.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.746
He's got really pretty eyes.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.649
It's over.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.052
Without the tractor,
the harvest is as good as dead.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.820
Like my kidneys.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.590
I have pretty serious
diabetes, Toshi.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.877

20:12.911 --> 20:14.645
I got caught in a cool front.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.114
But it passed.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.850
Well, I'm sure that's special
what you just said,

20:19.885 --> 20:22.286
but we really got
to bring in the harvest.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.621
We're with ya!

20:23.655 --> 20:25.289
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

20:27.926 --> 20:29.527
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

20:31.997 --> 20:33.497
Um...

20:33.532 --> 20:36.400

did you put any gas in it?

20:36.435 --> 20:38.002
Oh. You didn't fill it up?!

20:38.036 --> 20:39.837
The tractor's dead!

20:39.871 --> 20:41.272
I'm ruined!

20:41.306 --> 20:42.707
You ruined me!

20:42.741 --> 20:45.509
Well, Snot's Uncle Solomon,
the important thing is

20:45.544 --> 20:47.278
I learned something
about friendship today.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.414
No! That's not
what's important <i>at all!</i>

20:50.449 --> 20:52.483
I'm gonna lose my farm.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.752
I'm gonna be homeless.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.188
Okay, I guess we'll just have
to agree to disagree.

20:57.222 --> 20:58.856
Out! Get out!

20:58.890 --> 21:01.125
Go on, git!

21:03.795 --> 21:06.130
I'm sorry about all that, Snot.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.799
Hey, family comes and goes.
