00:01.680 --> 00:02.980
<b>Kite is alive!</b>

00:04.410 --> 00:08.410
<b>He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!</b>

00:09.380 --> 00:11.150
<b>So we should hurry back...</b>

00:11.740 --> 00:12.870
<b>Once we're stronger.</b>

00:15.550 --> 00:17.070
<b>To save Kite!</b>

01:37.990 --> 01:42.990
<b>Promise x and x Reunion</b>

01:44.770 --> 01:47.460
<b>Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite.</b>

01:48.250 --> 01:50.790
<b>But before they can return to NGL,</b>

01:50.790 --> 01:54.110
<b>they must pass the condition 
set by Chairman Netero,</b>

01:54.110 --> 01:57.470
<b>leader of the punitive force.</b>

01:59.530 --> 02:00.970
<b>What are those?</b>

02:01.750 --> 02:02.750
<b>Tokens.</b>

02:03.250 --> 02:05.900
<b>You take a piece of marked wood and split it,</b>

02:05.900 --> 02:07.980
<b>giving each half to a different person.</b>

02:08.950 --> 02:10.780
<b>They work as proof that you're an ally</b>

02:10.780 --> 02:12.480
<b>or to authenticate a document.</b>

02:14.090 --> 02:17.990
<b><i>We sent two assassins to the nearest village.</i></b>

02:21.440 --> 02:22.990
<b>In this case,</b>

02:22.990 --> 02:25.800
<b>each of the two assassins 
holds one matching token.</b>

02:27.900 --> 02:29.710
<b>We defeat them and take the tokens.</b>

02:42.570 --> 02:44.010
<b>It's been erased.</b>

02:44.700 --> 02:46.660
<b>That means someone checked the board.</b>

02:47.230 --> 02:48.020
<b>Yeah.</b>

02:53.520 --> 02:57.040
<b>You must be Killua and Gon.</b>

02:58.610 --> 03:00.400
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

03:01.410 --> 03:04.780
<b>My name is Palm.</b>

03:06.220 --> 03:08.040
<b>It's a pleasure.</b>

03:09.770 --> 03:12.020
<b>Oh, dear...</b>

03:12.020 --> 03:14.470
<b>No need to be so tense.</b>

03:14.470 --> 03:18.010
<b>I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details.</b>

03:18.540 --> 03:20.440
<b>Allow me to explain.</b>

03:20.440 --> 03:22.290
<b>Why don't we have some tea?</b>

03:26.650 --> 03:30.060
<b>I am a student of Knov-sensei.</b>

03:30.610 --> 03:34.420
<b>He said I would only get in his way...</b>

03:34.420 --> 03:36.270
<b>But I insisted on accompanying him.</b>

03:37.130 --> 03:38.330
<b>Who's that?</b>

03:38.330 --> 03:41.250
<b>She probably means one of the 
guys with Chairman Netero.</b>

03:41.250 --> 03:43.820
<b>Yes, the one wearing a black suit...</b>

03:44.390 --> 03:47.050
<b>My teacher is an incredible person.</b>

03:47.050 --> 03:50.120
<b>Cool, intelligent, composed...</b>

03:50.120 --> 03:53.090
<b>Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!</b>

03:53.090 --> 03:54.120
<b>Oh, dear...</b>

03:54.120 --> 03:56.790
<b>Oh, but I only respect him, that's all.</b>

03:56.790 --> 03:59.210
<b>There's nothing romantic about my feelings...</b>

04:00.250 --> 04:03.600
<b>At least, I may wish that were the case.</b>

04:05.760 --> 04:11.240
<b>After all, when it comes to falling 
in love, respect is a major factor.</b>

04:11.610 --> 04:15.590
<b>Ah, my teacher knows nothing 
about this, of course.</b>

04:15.590 --> 04:18.240
<b>I haven't said a word to him, 
and I don't intend to.</b>

04:26.040 --> 04:29.540
<b>No one can say what will happen...</b>

04:30.100 --> 04:33.750
<b>After all, love is a spontaneous thing,</b>

04:33.750 --> 04:34.980
<b>don't you agree?</b>

04:34.980 --> 04:37.080
<b>Uh, can I interrupt you?</b>

04:37.080 --> 04:38.660
<b>Aren't we supposed to fight you?</b>

04:39.050 --> 04:41.010
<b>Huh? Oh, dear...</b>

04:41.010 --> 04:43.050
<b>Yes, I apologize.</b>

04:43.510 --> 04:45.330
<b>The Chairman and my teacher</b>

04:45.330 --> 04:49.360
<b>said I couldn't accompany them any farther.</b>

04:50.570 --> 04:53.010
<b>But I insisted on going with them.</b>

04:53.010 --> 04:59.230
<b>It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying 
to convince them of my determination.</b>

04:59.230 --> 05:01.890
<b>And finally, they relented, with one condition.</b>

05:02.840 --> 05:04.190
<b>Uh, I'm asking about...</b>

05:04.190 --> 05:07.730
<b>My teacher may appear a cold person,</b>

05:07.730 --> 05:09.490
<b>but he's actually quite gentle.</b>

05:09.490 --> 05:13.630
<b>But you have to spend a lot of 
time with him to realize that.</b>

05:13.630 --> 05:16.450
<b>Ah, by "spending time with him," I don't mean—</b>

05:16.450 --> 05:18.630
<b>Okay! What's the condition?!</b>

05:20.790 --> 05:24.210
<b>Knuckle and Shoot's defeat.</b>

05:25.160 --> 05:32.270
<b>To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats</b>

05:32.270 --> 05:35.520
<b>will be allowed inside NGL before me...</b>

05:35.520 --> 05:37.640
<b>I cannot allow that.</b>

05:37.640 --> 05:40.360
<b>Palm-san, turn off your <i>Hatsu</i>!</b>

05:41.930 --> 05:45.040
<b><i>She's an Enhancer like me.</i></b>

05:45.040 --> 05:46.670
<b><i>I'm not too happy about that.</i></b>

05:46.670 --> 05:48.460
<b>Knuckle and Shoot?</b>

05:48.460 --> 05:49.720
<b>Not us?</b>

05:49.720 --> 05:50.830
<b>That's right.</b>

05:51.920 --> 05:57.080
<b>After all, I'm not the one who's 
supposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot.</b>

05:57.080 --> 05:59.000
<b>You two are.</b>

06:00.720 --> 06:04.000
<b>Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students.</b>

06:06.180 --> 06:09.330
<b>They, too, received a condition.</b>

06:09.330 --> 06:12.510
<b>I don't know what that condition was...</b>

06:12.510 --> 06:18.520
<b>But whether it's us or them, only one 
group will be allowed into NGL.</b>

06:19.020 --> 06:22.020
<b>The deadline is one month.</b>

06:22.640 --> 06:27.720
<b>Since we were told to keep 
these tokens for a month,</b>

06:27.720 --> 06:31.710
<b>that means someone will come for them.</b>

06:37.990 --> 06:40.290
<b>What do we do, Knuckle?</b>

06:40.930 --> 06:42.290
<b>That's easy.</b>

06:42.840 --> 06:44.170
<b>He who strikes first, wins!</b>

06:44.910 --> 06:46.760
<b>Find 'em...</b>

06:47.120 --> 06:48.610
<b>And kill 'em!</b>

06:47.990 --> 06:49.430
<b>Certain Death</b>

06:50.330 --> 06:52.930
<b>My name is Knuckle Bine!</b>

06:53.200 --> 06:55.310
<b>I am a Beast Hunter!</b>

06:55.660 --> 07:00.080
<b>I challenge the two punitive 
force candidates to a duel!</b>

07:00.550 --> 07:05.080
<b>Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!</b>

07:04.190 --> 07:12.950
<b>Bring it on</b>

07:05.410 --> 07:07.750
<b>I won't try to run or hide.</b>

07:07.750 --> 07:10.220
<b>I won't bring any weapons or allies.</b>

07:10.220 --> 07:12.300
<b>It'll just be me and me alone.</b>

07:12.950 --> 07:15.990
<b>So come and fight me!</b>

07:15.990 --> 07:16.830
<b><i>But where?</i></b>

07:17.160 --> 07:18.580
<b><i>The location?</i></b>

07:18.870 --> 07:21.580
<b><i>You have to tell them where to find you.</i></b>

07:21.580 --> 07:33.840
<b>Bring it on</b>

07:21.820 --> 07:26.430
<b>A man never turns his back on an enemy.</b>

07:26.430 --> 07:29.090
<b>I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth...</b>

07:29.550 --> 07:32.460
<b>You won't get away!</b>

07:31.340 --> 07:33.840
<b><i>Even if he said where, I wouldn't go.</i></b>

07:34.880 --> 07:36.390
<b>He's just a decoy.</b>

07:36.390 --> 07:38.720
<b>His partner's probably hidden 
somewhere, watching.</b>

07:39.150 --> 07:44.240
<b>They're watching to see if 
anyone reacts suspiciously.</b>

07:44.830 --> 07:49.170
<b>According to Palm, they don't 
even know our names.</b>

07:49.170 --> 07:50.110
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:50.880 --> 07:53.150
<b>So their goal must be to smoke us out.</b>

07:53.740 --> 07:56.020
<b>No one's stupid enough to do all that for real.</b>

07:56.820 --> 07:58.740
<b>Did he look strong?</b>

07:59.620 --> 08:00.750
<b>He's pretty strong.</b>

08:03.420 --> 08:05.400
<b>What will it take to defeat him?</b>

08:06.410 --> 08:08.250
<b>I have no idea!</b>

08:08.900 --> 08:10.990
<b>One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that</b>

08:11.390 --> 08:13.670
<b>In a <i>Nen</i> battle, nothing is certain.</b>

08:14.490 --> 08:17.320
<b>So, according to him,</b>

08:17.320 --> 08:20.620
<b>it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won.</b>

08:20.620 --> 08:21.960
<b>I disagree.</b>

08:23.180 --> 08:26.420
<b>If you want to survive, you must 
increase your odds of victory.</b>

08:27.010 --> 08:30.780
<b>Gauging the strength differential between 
you and an opponent is crucial.</b>

08:33.640 --> 08:36.070
<b>If you're up against someone you can only beat</b>

08:36.070 --> 08:38.820
<b>once or twice out of a 
hundred times, don't bother.</b>

08:41.790 --> 08:43.660
<b>You need at least a fifty-percent chance.</b>

08:45.310 --> 08:47.800
<b>If possible, greater than 
seventy percent is preferable.</b>

08:48.670 --> 08:51.920
<b>To reach that, we must do two things...</b>

08:52.740 --> 08:56.890
<b>Work on our fundamentals, and learn 
more about our opponents' abilities.</b>

08:56.890 --> 08:57.800
<b>Right.</b>

08:58.570 --> 09:01.930
<b>If we know our opponents' abilities, 
it'll be easier to plan ahead.</b>

09:01.930 --> 09:03.420
<b>Like we did against Genthru.</b>

09:06.010 --> 09:08.440
<b>I'm half agreed, and half opposed.</b>

09:09.390 --> 09:10.690
<b>What do you mean?</b>

09:10.690 --> 09:13.700
<b>I think we should work on our fundamentals,</b>

09:13.700 --> 09:16.950
<b>but I don't think we need to know their abilities.</b>

09:17.340 --> 09:19.400
<b>Huh? Why not?</b>

09:19.400 --> 09:21.820
<b>That just increases our risk of defeat.</b>

09:21.820 --> 09:23.450
<b>Nothing good can come of that!</b>

09:23.780 --> 09:27.960
<b>But that's what we'll be facing in NGL.</b>

09:29.100 --> 09:32.730
<b>Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot...</b>

09:33.120 --> 09:37.260
<b>It's to become stronger, 
and return to NGL and save Kite.</b>

09:40.770 --> 09:41.730
<b>In other words,</b>

09:41.730 --> 09:46.270
<b>we must be strong enough to defeat 
enemies we know nothing about.</b>

09:46.870 --> 09:49.920
<b>Winning here with advance 
preparation is pointless.</b>

09:50.590 --> 09:52.150
<b>That's true,</b>

09:52.410 --> 09:54.860
<b>but we have to defeat these opponents first.</b>

09:56.290 --> 10:00.010
<b>After all, we only have a month.</b>

10:00.680 --> 10:02.160
<b>That's too long.</b>

10:03.020 --> 10:04.450
<b>One week.</b>

10:04.450 --> 10:07.290
<b>In one week, we'll be stronger, 
and heading back to NGL!</b>

10:07.820 --> 10:08.490
<b>Go—</b>

10:09.190 --> 10:10.750
<b>Are you an idiot?!</b>

10:14.760 --> 10:16.040
<b>Bisky!</b>

10:17.200 --> 10:18.910
<b>Why are you here?</b>

10:18.910 --> 10:21.010
<b>I asked her to come.</b>

10:21.010 --> 10:23.420
<b>Huh? You know each other?</b>

10:23.420 --> 10:27.290
<b>No, I looked into your backgrounds.</b>

10:27.290 --> 10:28.490
<b>How?</b>

10:28.490 --> 10:29.900
<b>We only know Bisky because...</b>

10:31.430 --> 10:35.000
<b>Once I used my power, it was quite simple.</b>

10:35.000 --> 10:37.430
<b>Now, there's no time to spare.</b>

10:37.430 --> 10:38.400
<b>Let's begin...</b>

10:39.940 --> 10:43.300
<b>The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples.</b>

10:43.300 --> 10:44.740
<b>Um, no.</b>

10:48.900 --> 10:50.600
<b>Let's get started, then.</b>

10:50.600 --> 10:51.420
<b>Osu!</b>

10:53.380 --> 10:55.490
<b>What was that for?!</b>

10:55.490 --> 10:56.940
<b>I'm picking up where I left off.</b>

10:56.940 --> 10:58.300
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

10:58.810 --> 11:02.430
<b>That old man's famous for his nasty nature.</b>

11:05.340 --> 11:07.900
<b>If he tells you to do something in a month,</b>

11:07.900 --> 11:11.670
<b>it probably should take an entire year.</b>

11:11.670 --> 11:14.190
<b>You won't defeat them after a week!</b>

11:14.570 --> 11:19.180
<b>But we have to hurry back and save Kite.</b>

11:19.180 --> 11:21.070
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

11:29.770 --> 11:31.790
<b>That was fun...</b>

11:32.420 --> 11:34.720
<b>Like a dream come true.</b>

11:40.370 --> 11:42.510
<b>I'd love to fight you...</b>

11:44.560 --> 11:45.950
<b>once more.</b>

11:48.230 --> 11:49.570
<b>I see...</b>

11:50.470 --> 11:54.180
<b>All the more reason you shouldn't 
return without proper training!</b>

11:55.100 --> 11:58.060
<b>What if you make the same mistake again?!</b>

11:58.060 --> 11:59.940
<b><i>So typical of her age.</i></b>

11:59.940 --> 12:01.990
<b><i>She's always ready with a lecture.</i></b>

12:02.530 --> 12:03.990
<b>Got it?</b>

12:04.490 --> 12:05.540
<b>Osu...</b>

12:05.540 --> 12:07.640
<b>Let's start training, then.</b>

12:10.740 --> 12:13.210
<b>Begin with <i>Ren</i>!</b>

12:16.780 --> 12:19.630
<b>Maintain that for three hours.</b>

12:21.630 --> 12:24.120
<b>Killua, how long can you last?</b>

12:24.120 --> 12:27.890
<b>In top condition, I can manage 
around fifty-five minutes, max.</b>

12:28.180 --> 12:30.770
<b>Until you complete this, 
we can't move to the next step.</b>

12:31.230 --> 12:33.190
<b>Train like your lives are on the line!</b>

12:50.670 --> 12:51.820
<b>Come on.</b>

12:51.820 --> 12:54.120
<b>You didn't even last an hour.</b>

12:54.120 --> 12:55.290
<b>Okay, keep working.</b>

13:01.610 --> 13:06.060
<b>They say it takes a month to add ten 
minutes to your <i>Ren</i> endurance.</b>

13:06.470 --> 13:09.050
<b>You won't have time to sleep.</b>

13:15.480 --> 13:17.810
<b>Curses...</b>

13:18.100 --> 13:21.050
<b>Those damn cowards ran away!</b>

13:21.050 --> 13:23.440
<b>You bastards deserve to die now!</b>

13:31.470 --> 13:33.470
<b>You have a collar.</b>

13:33.470 --> 13:35.440
<b>Where's your owner?</b>

13:35.930 --> 13:39.590
<b>You're supposed to keep the park clean.</b>

13:40.940 --> 13:42.840
<b>Okay, you can rest for today!</b>

13:43.190 --> 13:45.460
<b>Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes.</b>

13:51.630 --> 13:55.540
<b>Looks like it's time for me to use my power.</b>

14:13.050 --> 14:15.500
<b>Take it away, Cookie-chan.</b>

14:20.750 --> 14:24.650
<b><i>Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage.</i></b>

14:23.920 --> 14:25.760
<b>Pink Relief</b>

14:30.690 --> 14:31.620
<b>Excuse me...</b>

14:32.630 --> 14:35.470
<b>I hope this won't offend you,</b>

14:35.470 --> 14:38.180
<b>but I'll let you decide how to train them.</b>

14:38.180 --> 14:42.020
<b>Since my power told me that 
you would be the answer.</b>

14:42.640 --> 14:44.050
<b>However,</b>

14:44.050 --> 14:50.400
<b>if they cannot defeat Morel's 
disciples after one month,</b>

14:50.400 --> 14:55.000
<b>I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself.</b>

14:55.000 --> 14:58.610
<b>I absolutely must go to NGL.</b>

14:58.610 --> 15:00.840
<b>Honestly, I want to depart this moment.</b>

15:00.840 --> 15:05.040
<b>So after I've waited and waited 
and waited and waited and waited,</b>

15:05.040 --> 15:06.550
<b>if this fails now,</b>

15:07.190 --> 15:10.800
<b>I'll probably kill all of you...</b>

15:10.800 --> 15:12.310
<b>Was that a threat?</b>

15:12.780 --> 15:14.780
<b>No, it's a warning.</b>

15:14.780 --> 15:17.220
<b>I'm worried about you all.</b>

15:17.220 --> 15:22.310
<b>So if you think they have no chance, 
I recommend that you leave...</b>

15:22.650 --> 15:27.730
<b>Speaking from experience, I'm less 
likely to lose my temper that way.</b>

15:28.240 --> 15:31.350
<b>I'm not the one you should tell.</b>

15:31.350 --> 15:33.820
<b>Once they're awake, tell the boys.</b>

15:38.110 --> 15:40.340
<b>Don't worry! We've got this!</b>

15:40.340 --> 15:43.580
<b>You can count on us to get you to NGL.</b>

15:43.900 --> 15:47.750
<b>So let us know if you notice anything.</b>

15:47.750 --> 15:49.120
<b>We'll do our best.</b>

15:53.240 --> 15:54.670
<b>That's how they are.</b>

15:54.670 --> 15:56.100
<b>Have some faith.</b>

16:03.630 --> 16:04.400
<b>Oh, dear!</b>

16:04.400 --> 16:06.490
<b>This won't do at all...</b>

16:07.510 --> 16:12.430
<b>Anyway, I'm more concerned about 
what's happening inside NGL.</b>

16:12.860 --> 16:16.140
<b>What is the Chairman's group 
doing for the next month?</b>

16:16.140 --> 16:16.740
<b>Well?!</b>

16:17.840 --> 16:19.250
<b>Ah, well...</b>

16:19.250 --> 16:22.450
<b>They mentioned they'd be poking and probing.</b>

16:22.450 --> 16:26.250
<b>Identifying the enemy's strengths, 
and weakening their forces...</b>

16:27.220 --> 16:30.200
<b>The experts can't agree on the amount of time</b>

16:30.200 --> 16:33.870
<b>remaining before the King's birth.</b>

16:33.870 --> 16:37.270
<b>The Chairman is operating with two months,</b>

16:37.270 --> 16:39.290
<b>the earliest prediction, as the deadline.</b>

16:41.560 --> 16:43.230
<b>This is bad.</b>

16:47.550 --> 16:50.530
<b>That thing is stronger than I am.</b>

16:51.250 --> 16:53.800
<b>Stronger than the Chairman?</b>

16:53.800 --> 16:55.410
<b>Surely you jest.</b>

16:55.760 --> 16:57.420
<b>If that's really true,</b>

16:57.420 --> 17:01.640
<b>none of the Hunters will be able to fight it.</b>

17:02.530 --> 17:08.270
<b>It's been more than half a century since 
I was the strongest among <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

17:08.860 --> 17:13.050
<b>Now, I'm more or less even with you guys.</b>

17:13.400 --> 17:16.010
<b>Then you're more than strong enough.</b>

17:16.620 --> 17:18.620
<b>You should have more confidence.</b>

17:18.620 --> 17:22.010
<b>Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?</b>

17:22.010 --> 17:24.170
<b>Growing old is no fun.</b>

17:25.100 --> 17:27.180
<b>He never stops talking.</b>

17:27.180 --> 17:28.810
<b>But we must fight.</b>

17:29.440 --> 17:32.470
<b>I would prefer to avoid it...</b>

17:32.970 --> 17:36.310
<b>If there were a solution that would 
avoid a fight, I'd choose it.</b>

17:37.490 --> 17:41.260
<b>Our target is the Queen, 
and the Queen alone.</b>

17:42.010 --> 17:45.960
<b>But sneaking past the surveillance of 
that <i>En</i> will be next to impossible.</b>

17:45.960 --> 17:48.530
<b>We cannot avoid a fight...</b>

17:49.830 --> 17:52.980
<b>The question is how we will manage to win.</b>

17:53.590 --> 17:56.590
<b>If anyone has any brilliant ideas, 
I'd like to hear them.</b>

17:57.520 --> 17:59.540
<b>You're simply awful.</b>

18:00.070 --> 18:03.670
<b>When you asked us to join, did you not 
already have an answer in mind?</b>

18:07.100 --> 18:10.450
<b>We exterminate the Ants 
in silence, one at a time.</b>

18:35.670 --> 18:38.050
<b>Yeah, let's take it slow.</b>

18:38.550 --> 18:41.260
<b>Might as well enjoy the job...</b>

18:41.980 --> 18:43.270
<b>Okay...</b>

18:43.760 --> 18:47.070
<b>First, we should learn the enemy's numbers.</b>

18:47.700 --> 18:48.440
<b>Go.</b>

18:58.790 --> 19:00.300
<b><i>So many.</i></b>

19:00.810 --> 19:02.290
<b><i>Something is coming.</i></b>

19:02.780 --> 19:04.580
<b><i>They aren't alive...</i></b>

19:05.270 --> 19:07.070
<b><i>Is this the enemy's power?</i></b>

19:07.650 --> 19:10.210
<b><i>Now, what to do?</i></b>

19:11.440 --> 19:13.420
<b>You may as well wait.</b>

19:15.910 --> 19:19.720
<b>If they come here, we simply destroy them.</b>

19:20.290 --> 19:22.450
<b>You have a point.</b>

19:22.450 --> 19:24.430
<b>These could be decoys.</b>

19:24.430 --> 19:25.760
<b>Huh, what?</b>

19:25.760 --> 19:27.730
<b>Was I speaking aloud?</b>

19:28.130 --> 19:29.150
<b>No.</b>

19:29.690 --> 19:32.480
<b>I simply knew what you were thinking.</b>

19:33.070 --> 19:34.980
<b>Who are you, anyway?</b>

19:38.250 --> 19:41.000
<b>One of the Queen's Royal Guard.</b>

19:42.110 --> 19:43.460
<b>Shaiapouf.</b>

19:47.540 --> 19:51.500
<b>Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken.</b>

19:54.580 --> 19:57.780
<b><i>Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf.</i></b>

19:58.700 --> 20:01.380
<b>Yes, that is correct.</b>

20:02.180 --> 20:04.410
<b>You can read all my thoughts.</b>

20:04.410 --> 20:05.720
<b>Not sure I like that.</b>

20:05.720 --> 20:08.720
<b>Well, I can understand the sentiment.</b>

20:11.390 --> 20:12.330
<b>But...</b>

20:13.590 --> 20:15.050
<b>He will wake soon.</b>

20:15.050 --> 20:16.650
<b>That's good news!</b>

20:18.010 --> 20:24.020
<b>You see, I haven't been able to 
decide what power to develop.</b>

20:31.860 --> 20:34.720
<b>Right, it's so simple.</b>

20:35.660 --> 20:37.700
<b>I merely need to fix him.</b>

20:37.700 --> 20:39.710
<b>I only need the power to do that.</b>

20:44.650 --> 20:49.930
<b>And then, I will be able to experience 
that dreamlike moment with you</b>

20:50.790 --> 20:52.390
<b>once more...</b>

21:05.950 --> 21:07.950
<b>Come on, what are you doing?</b>

21:08.570 --> 21:13.120
<b>You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot, 
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.</b>

21:13.510 --> 21:16.160
<b>Are you giving up on going to NGL?</b>

21:18.460 --> 21:20.130
<b>N-No way...</b>

21:21.050 --> 21:22.660
<b>We never give up.</b>

21:24.220 --> 21:29.110
<b>We must return to NGL, no matter 
what we have to do to get there!</b>

21:36.580 --> 21:38.890
<b>To save Kite...</b>

21:44.860 --> 21:46.970
<b>After reuniting with Bisky,</b>

21:46.970 --> 21:49.380
<b>Gon and Killua are back to training.</b>

21:49.380 --> 21:51.500
<b>They have one goal:</b>

21:51.500 --> 21:54.500
<b>to get strong enough to save Kite.</b>

21:54.870 --> 21:58.780
<b>Right now, that motivation is driving Gon.</b>

23:25.150 --> 23:28.050
<b>Next time: Duel x and x Escape.</b>

23:28.050 --> 23:29.170
<b>It's on, Killua!</b>

23:29.170 --> 23:30.490
<b>It's on, Gon!</b>

23:32.020 --> 23:33.800
<b>Rock, paper... Rock!</b>

23:34.150 --> 23:35.680
<b>I lost...</b>
