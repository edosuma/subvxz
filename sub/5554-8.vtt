00:02.169 --> 00:03.501
CABE:
<i> Fish.</i>

00:03.503 --> 00:05.336
Okay.

00:06.038 --> 00:07.170
Poodle.

00:07.172 --> 00:08.171
Yikes.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.206
What's this?
Establishing Cabe's

00:10.208 --> 00:11.140
personality baseline.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.374
Spider.

00:12.376 --> 00:13.708
(chuckles) Wow.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.693
I'm researching the use

00:15.694 --> 00:17.677
of behaviorism
into predicting the future.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.147
I say if you know
the psychological ground floor

00:20.149 --> 00:22.082
of a subject,
its tendencies or its maladies,

00:22.084 --> 00:26.286
I'm postulating you can
predict future behavior.

00:26.288 --> 00:28.187
Test will be if he pulls
another shocked face,

00:28.189 --> 00:30.689
will he see my foot flying
toward his butt?

00:30.691 --> 00:32.357
I'll expect it.

00:32.359 --> 00:34.192
PAIGE: Why the sudden interest
in predicting the future?

00:34.194 --> 00:35.726
Where's Walter?

00:35.728 --> 00:37.561
He's at the hospital,
visiting Megan.

00:37.563 --> 00:38.762
Oh, there

00:38.764 --> 00:40.130
a connection there?

00:40.132 --> 00:41.331
Megan and predicting the future?

00:41.333 --> 00:44.300
Paige, you just leave
the shrinking to me.

00:47.204 --> 00:49.103
When did this begin?

00:49.105 --> 00:51.572
A few days ago.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.374
Respiratory infection,

00:54.376 --> 00:56.676
for someone with MS, is very...

00:56.678 --> 00:58.210
concerning.

00:58.212 --> 01:01.079
Did the doctors give you
an antibiotic cocktail?

01:01.081 --> 01:04.082
They just put me on one.

01:04.084 --> 01:07.218
Plus 100 milligrams
of prednisone.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.220
You know, an infection like
this can lead to sepsis

01:09.222 --> 01:10.254
or low blood pressure?

01:10.256 --> 01:11.622
Yes, Walter.
Yeah.

01:11.624 --> 01:13.223
And I'm on several I.V. drips

01:13.225 --> 01:15.358
to make
my heart beat harder.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.258
Did they give you, uh...

01:16.260 --> 01:18.159
I knew the minute I told you,

01:18.161 --> 01:19.426
you would start
spouting research

01:19.428 --> 01:20.627
and second-guessing.

01:20.629 --> 01:23.295
Do I do that?

01:26.066 --> 01:28.299
It's under control.

01:30.303 --> 01:31.735
Okay, get some rest.

01:31.737 --> 01:33.103
Check in later.

01:33.105 --> 01:35.472
Okay.

01:35.474 --> 01:37.607
WALTER:
You know, I'm, uh...

01:37.609 --> 01:40.209
I'm baffled that you didn't

01:40.211 --> 01:42.244
inform me
of her condition sooner.

01:42.246 --> 01:43.578
This only started
a few days ago,

01:43.580 --> 01:44.979
and Megan didn't want you

01:44.980 --> 01:46.379
to divert your attention
over to her.

01:46.382 --> 01:48.281
I need more time.

01:48.283 --> 01:50.383
And in a few weeks,
I'll have the rocket finished

01:50.385 --> 01:51.851
and submitted
to the Karman Prize.

01:51.853 --> 01:53.385
And then when I win,
I'll have an influx

01:53.387 --> 01:55.620
of 50 million in cash
to buy equipment

01:55.622 --> 01:57.788
to finish my research to save her.
Walter,

01:57.790 --> 01:59.823
the doctors aren't discussing
her condition in terms of weeks.

01:59.825 --> 02:01.691
We don't give in.
No, you stay with her today,

02:01.693 --> 02:03.693
and you make sure that
her treatment stays aggressive.

02:03.695 --> 02:05.111
Isn't that up to Megan?

02:05.112 --> 02:06.528
Any sign that her blood pressure
is getting too low,

02:06.531 --> 02:09.098
then you tell them
to increase her meds

02:09.100 --> 02:10.265
or add a new agent
like phenylephrine.

02:10.267 --> 02:11.817
Are you listening to me?

02:11.818 --> 02:13.368
Can we take a breath
and think about her

02:13.370 --> 02:14.469
and her quality of life?

02:14.471 --> 02:16.304
More important...

02:16.306 --> 02:18.172
is preserving her life

02:18.174 --> 02:19.373
and her mind.

02:21.643 --> 02:23.809
We do whatever it takes.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.245
Promise me you will do
the right thing.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.780
I promise.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.748
All right.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.417
<i> So, the initial plan,</i>

02:34.419 --> 02:37.186
uh, for the project budgeted

02:37.188 --> 02:39.488
at 15 months,

02:39.490 --> 02:41.790
but given Megan's condition,
it will have to be accelerated

02:41.792 --> 02:44.192
to being underway within three,

02:44.194 --> 02:46.326
and then Megan's life
will be saved.

02:49.431 --> 02:50.897
Questions?

02:50.899 --> 02:52.565
Yes?

02:52.567 --> 02:55.234
Well, what exactly is the plan
to save her life?

02:55.236 --> 02:56.335
Yes.

02:56.337 --> 02:57.903
So, uh, I am going
to download her brain,

02:57.905 --> 02:59.504
her thoughts,
her consciousness, her memories,

02:59.506 --> 03:00.505
preserve them digitally,

03:00.507 --> 03:03.207
until I can find another vessel

03:03.209 --> 03:05.409
after her body fails.

03:05.411 --> 03:06.276
Not in three months.

03:06.278 --> 03:07.810
Maybe 20 years.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.178
Megan does not have that long.

03:09.180 --> 03:10.730
So, in order

03:10.731 --> 03:12.281
to save her mind,
I need to build something

03:12.283 --> 03:13.649
that does not exist.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.684
It's a-a data server
with the capacity

03:15.686 --> 03:17.852
to store the contents
of the human brain.

03:17.854 --> 03:20.654
That's at least 50 petabytes
of storage capacity.

03:20.656 --> 03:23.356
The immediate issue is funding.

03:23.358 --> 03:25.324
The Karman prize, uh,
won't judge for months,

03:25.326 --> 03:26.792
so I need starter capital,

03:26.794 --> 03:29.427
which means I'll have
to take on other jobs,

03:29.429 --> 03:30.861
so I may not be here.

03:30.863 --> 03:33.430
We all want to do anything
we can to help, Walter, but...

03:33.432 --> 03:37.434
I think our primary question is
how are you doing emotionally?

03:37.436 --> 03:38.435
Oh, I'm fine.

03:38.437 --> 03:39.536
I figure it's gonna run me

03:39.538 --> 03:41.738
a million per petabyte.
About that.

03:41.740 --> 03:43.406
So I'm gonna go call
our wealthiest clients,

03:43.408 --> 03:44.840
see what I can't drum up.

03:44.842 --> 03:47.309
He's officially gone
through the looking glass.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.444
I don't like the way
he's handling this.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.946
I don't think any of them are
gonna be able to handle it.

03:51.948 --> 03:53.380
I think that...

03:53.382 --> 03:55.482
What?

03:57.519 --> 03:58.684
Who the hell is that?

03:58.686 --> 04:00.385
Identify yourself.

04:00.387 --> 04:02.487
Mark Willis,
Central Intelligence.

04:02.489 --> 04:03.688
CIA.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.389
Explains how he came
in like a cloud.

04:05.391 --> 04:06.991
Dark cloud.

04:06.992 --> 04:08.592
Homeland's agreed to lend out
Scorpion's services

04:08.594 --> 04:10.360
to my unit.

04:10.362 --> 04:11.828
Oh, lucky us.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.763
For a significant payday.

04:13.765 --> 04:16.398
We're listening.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
This is the 27B/6.

04:18.402 --> 04:20.769
Brand-new flagship of an airline

04:20.771 --> 04:22.237
known as Integrity Airlines.

04:22.239 --> 04:23.371
No such thing.

04:23.373 --> 04:25.339
It's top-secret,
servicing only the CIA.

04:25.341 --> 04:26.773
You guys have
a secret airline?

04:26.775 --> 04:28.341
What kind of snacks
are we talking?

04:28.343 --> 04:29.608
Or is that a secret, too?

04:29.610 --> 04:31.476
Integrity functions
independently

04:31.478 --> 04:33.544
of any commercial or
military frequency.

04:33.546 --> 04:34.945
We have our own call signs,

04:34.947 --> 04:37.213
and we are
undetectable by radar.

04:37.215 --> 04:39.348
Nine hours ago,

04:39.349 --> 04:41.482
this plane was on a routine
mission and went missing.

04:41.485 --> 04:42.584
Define routine.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.651
Running money,

04:43.653 --> 04:45.419
weapons, copy machines

04:45.421 --> 04:47.521
or other tools of
country-building or takeover.

04:47.523 --> 04:48.989
What?

04:48.991 --> 04:51.624
That's not how the CIA
would use a secret plane?

04:51.626 --> 04:53.359
Last location ping?

04:53.361 --> 04:55.394
Over Fort Collins, Colorado.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.428
There's no indication of
a crash and no response

04:57.431 --> 04:59.531
to radio calls.
So hijacked?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.332
Doubtful.
Then the pilot stole it.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.802
Our men, highly trained
with spotless records.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.236
Sly, anything?

05:06.238 --> 05:07.470
SYLVESTER:
A plane heading west

05:07.472 --> 05:09.438
wouldn't double back
and risk suspicion

05:09.440 --> 05:10.939
by pinging
the same location twice.

05:10.941 --> 05:14.242
Okay, I'm running an analysis
on the sound package

05:14.244 --> 05:15.743
from the last ping.

05:15.745 --> 05:18.946
The plane was tilting down
when the last ping registered.

05:18.948 --> 05:21.014
A plane of that weight,
cruising at that speed,

05:21.016 --> 05:23.649
yields a possible
landing location of...

05:24.585 --> 05:26.018
Oh, my God.

05:26.019 --> 05:27.452
That's Coughlan Air Force Base.
That's Area 51.

05:27.454 --> 05:30.621
Secret spy mission
in Area 51-- spooky.

05:30.623 --> 05:32.356
No pun intended.

05:32.358 --> 05:33.908
The base and several miles
surrounding it

05:33.909 --> 05:35.459
are protected from eyes
in the sky by ambient microwaves

05:35.461 --> 05:36.460
as an active defense system.

05:36.462 --> 05:38.428
It disrupts satellite,

05:38.430 --> 05:40.530
cell and radio communication.

05:40.532 --> 05:41.731
It's all a part
of their moratorium

05:41.733 --> 05:43.265
on communication systems

05:43.267 --> 05:45.533
that haven't been
strictly sanctioned by the base.

05:45.535 --> 05:47.068
Cone of silence.

05:47.069 --> 05:48.602
The better to keep
their secrets safe.

05:49.571 --> 05:52.638
Am I the only one?
Area 51, aliens?

05:53.574 --> 05:55.774
A plane like this
would run quiet,

05:55.776 --> 05:57.675
probably use a tungsten alloy
in the fuselage

05:57.677 --> 05:58.809
for its vibration
stabilizing system.

05:58.811 --> 06:02.679
I can't confirm or deny that.

06:02.681 --> 06:04.514
Get us down to that desert.

06:04.516 --> 06:06.349
I can build a device
to detect

06:06.351 --> 06:08.684
the ionic gamma ray signature
of the tungsten alloy

06:08.686 --> 06:10.552
and find its exact location.

06:10.554 --> 06:12.554
Your superiors at Homeland
will be told

06:12.556 --> 06:14.722
you're upgrading
our data systems in Barstow.

06:14.724 --> 06:16.356
I never came in here.

06:16.358 --> 06:18.624
The size of your payday will
ensure you take special care

06:18.626 --> 06:20.359
to see that doesn't bother you.

06:20.361 --> 06:21.727
$50,000.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.061
$300,000.

06:23.063 --> 06:24.996
150, final offer.
HAPPY: Sold.

06:24.998 --> 06:27.665
Make my check out
to Walter O'Brien

06:27.667 --> 06:29.333
for Megan.

06:29.335 --> 06:30.534
Yeah, ditto.

06:30.536 --> 06:32.035
Same here.

06:32.037 --> 06:33.569
I'll take care of it.

06:33.571 --> 06:35.637
I look forward
to hearing from you.

06:37.707 --> 06:38.939
Excellent.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.441
Can get closer
to my research funding goals.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.509
No, "thank you"? Uh...

06:43.511 --> 06:45.444
We just made
a moving gesture

06:45.446 --> 06:47.012
for Megan and...

06:47.014 --> 06:48.913
We're helping him solve
a problem.

06:48.915 --> 06:51.448
He needs X amount of dollars;
we chipped away.

06:51.450 --> 06:53.316
Math is math.

06:53.318 --> 06:55.785
CABE: I think the
team's gonna need

06:55.787 --> 06:57.920
some hand-holding
regarding Megan.

06:57.922 --> 07:00.722
You deal with them,
and I'll take care of Walter.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.557
Yeah.

07:02.559 --> 07:05.493
♪ ♪

07:13.535 --> 07:16.469
Okay, the gamma ray spectrometer
is operational.

07:16.471 --> 07:17.770
SYLVESTER:
Just don't get too close

07:17.771 --> 07:19.070
to the base. You don't know
what they're working on.

07:19.073 --> 07:20.472
Or who.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.573
Aliens again?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.474
Don't know.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.908
I'm sorry, can you can
this blather?

07:24.910 --> 07:27.744
Sylvester, can I get
an update on Megan, please?

07:27.746 --> 07:29.412
Yeah, well,
I don't really know how well

07:29.414 --> 07:30.579
she's responding
to the treatment,

07:30.581 --> 07:31.713
but the doctor seems to think

07:31.715 --> 07:33.715
she'll be... (static)

07:33.717 --> 07:36.684
We've hit the cone of silence.

07:42.758 --> 07:46.626
You've asked Walter how
he's processing Megan's illness.

07:46.628 --> 07:49.495
How are<i> you</i> handling it?
I'm a physician.

07:49.497 --> 07:52.064
Illness, death, grief--
it's really just an influx

07:52.066 --> 07:54.733
of stress-related,
pro-inflammatory cytokines

07:54.735 --> 07:56.000
which eventually dissipate.

07:56.002 --> 07:59.103
So a friend's illness,
possible death, is...

07:59.105 --> 08:03.540
it's no more than just the...
clinical release of chemicals?

08:03.542 --> 08:06.042
No, no, I'm not discounting
the emotional.

08:06.044 --> 08:07.710
Whether it's
Bonanno's Four Trajectories

08:07.712 --> 08:09.812
or the five stages
of Kubler-Ross,

08:09.814 --> 08:11.814
it's a natural process.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.550
Anything natural,
to me, is fine.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.919
What's with the envelopes?

08:18.855 --> 08:21.522
Predictions of the future.

08:21.524 --> 08:23.023
I think I got something.

08:23.025 --> 08:25.458
The photon energy
is off the chart.

08:25.460 --> 08:27.126
Okay, hit the brakes!

08:33.400 --> 08:35.833
In your face,

08:35.835 --> 08:37.968
unfindable spy plane.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.402
Let's leave.

08:39.404 --> 08:41.036
There's no
tail number.

08:41.038 --> 08:42.904
We're being paid
a bundle--

08:42.906 --> 08:44.871
let's confirm that's our bird.

08:47.609 --> 08:49.675
♪ ♪

08:56.049 --> 08:58.115
No one here!

08:58.117 --> 09:01.651
Incredible photography unit
on the underside of this beast.

09:01.653 --> 09:04.153
You could take a portrait
of a flea at 30,000 feet.

09:04.155 --> 09:06.455
This all beyond
state-of-the-art, and...

09:06.457 --> 09:08.190
all hollow.

09:08.192 --> 09:09.524
I'm assuming hidden
compartments,

09:09.526 --> 09:11.192
in case anybody's ever searched.

09:11.194 --> 09:15.095
They made an effort to steal it
and then just... abandon it?

09:15.097 --> 09:17.097
I don't think so.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.965
I think they're coming back.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.835
There's a whole blood bank
down here.

09:22.837 --> 09:25.571
All AB-negative
with rare proteins.

09:25.573 --> 09:27.105
That's for someone
with aplastic anemia

09:27.107 --> 09:29.107
who needs regular
transfusions.

09:29.109 --> 09:31.008
That's neither
of the pilots.

09:31.010 --> 09:32.843
Not according to their dossiers.

09:32.845 --> 09:34.578
Just a guess here,

09:34.580 --> 09:37.013
but those pilots
might be picking up a passenger

09:37.015 --> 09:39.081
who isn't coming aboard
voluntarily.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.783
I got chloroform and zip ties.

09:41.785 --> 09:44.085
This isn't just a missing plane;
it's a kidnapping.

09:44.087 --> 09:47.521
Remember how you said it
couldn't be one of your pilots?

09:47.523 --> 09:50.056
Well, good chance it is--
so good luck with that.

09:50.058 --> 09:52.024
We'll take our
cashier's check now.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.091
What if I doubled the fee?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.125
No!
Keep talking.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.192
This gets out,

09:55.194 --> 09:56.193
the program is exposed

09:56.195 --> 09:57.694
and years of data go sour.

09:57.696 --> 09:59.495
If you find the agents,
find their victim

09:59.497 --> 10:02.097
and figure out where they plan
on taking him: 300 grand.

10:02.099 --> 10:03.765
Send in your own guys!

10:03.767 --> 10:05.867
They'll be long gone before
I can get a team assembled.

10:05.869 --> 10:08.002
Then get the base commander
at Coughlan to handle it.

10:08.004 --> 10:10.004
That also exposes the program.

10:10.006 --> 10:11.472
350 grand.

10:11.474 --> 10:12.506
Wait...
Deal!

10:12.508 --> 10:14.308
No!  Listen, you know what?

10:14.309 --> 10:16.109
I'll do it myself. You heard
Sylvester-- Megan is not improving.

10:16.111 --> 10:18.144
And I need the money
to complete my research.

10:20.047 --> 10:21.980
We'll all do it.
Good. Thank you.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.220
"The CIA dude will
rope us into something

10:29.222 --> 10:30.921
more dangerous than
finding a plane."

10:30.923 --> 10:32.789
I hate to say I told you so.
Why are you doing this?

10:32.791 --> 10:35.191
I want it on record that I
predicted that getting led around

10:35.193 --> 10:37.159
by the prospect of a payday
is bad business.

10:37.161 --> 10:40.195
Especially with
the CIA involved.

10:45.202 --> 10:47.802
TOBY: We are gonna sneak into
one of the most heavily guarded

10:47.804 --> 10:49.570
patches of U.S. soil,

10:49.572 --> 10:51.838
with no form of communication

10:51.840 --> 10:53.539
to track down an
unknown kidnapping victim,

10:53.541 --> 10:56.542
who may or may not already be in
the hands of rogue CIA agents.

10:56.544 --> 10:57.809
Yep.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.143
We're going into Area 51.

11:09.121 --> 11:11.788
All right, so, one more time
for the slightly less brilliant?

11:11.790 --> 11:13.656
So the people that
work on this base

11:13.658 --> 11:15.958
are experts in fields with
countless applications--

11:15.960 --> 11:17.125
most military,

11:17.127 --> 11:18.893
all dangerous
in the wrong hands.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.061
And that's who they're coming
to kidnap? An expert?

11:21.063 --> 11:22.796
Well, you can't just
walk into Area 51.

11:22.798 --> 11:24.264
So they stole
the only plane in the world

11:24.266 --> 11:26.065
that can fly under
Area 51's security.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.232
Any clue why we don't
just stay here

11:27.234 --> 11:28.566
and wait till
they come back?

11:28.568 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, I'm not so hot

11:29.902 --> 11:31.134
into sneaking into
mysterious Air Force bases.

11:31.136 --> 11:32.668
CABE:
And I'll wager

11:32.670 --> 11:34.202
the rogue agents are armed.

11:34.204 --> 11:35.803
I don't want to get
into a gunfight.

11:35.805 --> 11:37.805
We know the target
has a rare blood type,

11:37.807 --> 11:39.606
so we determine his identity

11:39.608 --> 11:41.074
through the base's
medical records

11:41.076 --> 11:42.842
and we track down
where he works on the base

11:42.844 --> 11:44.677
in order to
rescue him.

11:44.679 --> 11:45.978
What if they already
got their target?

11:45.980 --> 11:47.679
The CIA agents
got here before us.

11:47.681 --> 11:49.247
Could be six hours,
could be 30 minutes.

11:49.248 --> 11:50.814
CABE: But we still don't know
how they're getting on the base.

11:50.817 --> 11:52.850
If they're tunneling,
that's gonna take a while.

11:52.852 --> 11:54.218
Subterfuge,
also a time suck.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.153
We got a shot
at shutting this thing down.

11:56.155 --> 11:57.821
Yeah, but because of
the cone of silence,

11:57.823 --> 11:59.989
we can't just hack the base's
medical records externally,

11:59.991 --> 12:01.156
so we're heading in.

12:01.158 --> 12:02.824
Now, you guys find him,

12:02.826 --> 12:04.692
warn him and get him to safety.

12:04.694 --> 12:05.993
While you're just
catching some rays?

12:05.995 --> 12:07.561
Well, I'm happy to go,

12:07.563 --> 12:09.162
but who is gonna hack
the plane's guidance system

12:09.164 --> 12:10.263
to find its likely destination?

12:10.265 --> 12:11.648
You know, the other
half of our job?

12:11.649 --> 12:13.032
I'll keep guard in case
the bad guys come back.

12:13.034 --> 12:14.767
How do we break in?

12:14.769 --> 12:17.569
With these.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.305
Okay, we aim the plane's
reflective panels

12:21.307 --> 12:23.206
into my magnifying glass.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.707
The heat will be
the equivalent

12:24.709 --> 12:26.292
of 100 solar panels

12:26.293 --> 12:27.876
focused on an area
the size of a playing card,

12:27.878 --> 12:30.178
which I will aim directly

12:30.180 --> 12:32.813
at the tire
of a passing delivery truck.

12:32.815 --> 12:34.714
Boom goes the tire.

12:34.716 --> 12:36.182
And while the driver's
changing it,

12:36.183 --> 12:37.649
he gains extra cargo.
And since this is the only road

12:37.652 --> 12:40.252
into the base,
one is bound to come along soon.

12:40.254 --> 12:41.319
Until then, we wait.

12:43.056 --> 12:44.321
Disgusting.

12:44.323 --> 12:46.589
Dental hygiene is beautiful.

12:49.126 --> 12:50.592
(screams): Aah!

12:50.594 --> 12:52.326
(Walter typing rapidly)

12:54.863 --> 12:56.796
Cabe...

12:56.798 --> 12:57.930
look over here:

12:57.932 --> 13:00.098
Domestic flight paths

13:00.100 --> 13:03.267
circling over L.A.,
DC and Chicago.

13:03.269 --> 13:05.102
Now why is a CIA plane

13:05.104 --> 13:07.704
flying repeatedly
over U.S. cities? Huh?

13:07.706 --> 13:09.872
You're being paid to find
a final destination.

13:09.874 --> 13:11.206
Find it and let's
clear out of here.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.741
And when you're done, son,

13:13.743 --> 13:15.843
I want to talk to you
about your sister

13:15.845 --> 13:17.878
and what may be coming.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.646
Busy.

13:23.752 --> 13:25.084
Uh, I know
you're concerned

13:25.086 --> 13:26.919
about Walt on
the Megan thing.

13:26.921 --> 13:29.988
"The Megan thing"?
Her illness?

13:29.990 --> 13:32.123
Uh...

13:32.125 --> 13:33.190
He'll work through it.

13:33.192 --> 13:34.191
We all will.

13:34.193 --> 13:35.325
It is what it is.

13:35.327 --> 13:37.093
That's a little chilly.

13:37.095 --> 13:38.828
My mother died
the day I was born.

13:38.830 --> 13:41.230
Death has always been
a part of my life.

13:41.232 --> 13:44.666
Now, Sylvester... he's going
to be a basket case.

13:44.668 --> 13:47.101
He won't be able to handle it
as well as the rest of us.

13:47.103 --> 13:49.937
You may consider
it's okay to just...

13:49.939 --> 13:52.406
think about it and be sad.

13:53.976 --> 13:56.676
Or just don't think about it.

13:56.678 --> 13:57.677
Truck!

13:57.679 --> 13:58.744
Oh...

14:20.033 --> 14:21.999
Thing of beauty.
Let's move.

14:25.871 --> 14:26.936
(sighs)

14:26.938 --> 14:29.004
So... not the best news.

14:29.006 --> 14:30.939
The phenylephrine
didn't clear your lungs

14:30.941 --> 14:32.774
the way we had hoped.

14:32.776 --> 14:34.276
So...

14:34.277 --> 14:35.777
the aggressive treatment
would be...?

14:35.779 --> 14:37.178
Intubation.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.879
SYLVESTER: Then that's
the thing to do.

14:38.881 --> 14:40.213
Right?

14:44.152 --> 14:45.284
Not right?

14:45.286 --> 14:47.786
We're gonna need a minute.

14:49.823 --> 14:53.825
(door opens, closes)

14:53.827 --> 14:56.294
I don't want to be intubated.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.830
It's painful...

14:59.832 --> 15:02.432
and I'll have to be
under constant sedation...

15:02.434 --> 15:05.067
No, I...

15:05.069 --> 15:06.468
I have to encourage you

15:06.470 --> 15:08.002
to be aggressive.

15:09.238 --> 15:11.238
You have to stop being

15:11.240 --> 15:13.974
a conduit to my brother

15:13.976 --> 15:17.310
and be the man that I love.

15:24.752 --> 15:26.251
All through here!
Copy that!

15:39.131 --> 15:41.264
Take her to Gate Three!

15:41.266 --> 15:42.732
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir!

15:43.868 --> 15:45.367
Okay. Now all we need to do

15:45.369 --> 15:47.035
is access the base intranet

15:47.037 --> 15:48.903
and hack into
their medical records.

15:48.905 --> 15:50.137
Right. Easy.

15:50.139 --> 15:51.872
Just walk in an office
and find a computer.

15:51.874 --> 15:54.407
No, we can connect via
a peripheral system.

15:54.409 --> 15:57.076
Like the sprinkler
controls or...

15:57.078 --> 15:58.777
The sewer system.

16:03.816 --> 16:05.048
(computer blipping)

16:05.050 --> 16:06.315
HAPPY (quietly):
Okay...

16:06.317 --> 16:07.733
I am in their intranet,

16:07.734 --> 16:09.150
but their medical records
are tight as a drum.

16:09.153 --> 16:10.819
And with our best
hackers elsewhere,

16:10.821 --> 16:12.220
this could take
hours. Days.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.755
So we're stuck in a sewer
for no good reason?

16:14.757 --> 16:16.890
Unless we can call
Sly to hack it.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.224
It's an old-school PBX.

16:18.226 --> 16:20.526
Private branch exchange.

16:20.528 --> 16:22.060
They work best
on ground start trunks,

16:22.062 --> 16:23.494
if the intercom is
connected to an outside line.

16:23.496 --> 16:24.928
Okay, only one way to find out.

16:24.930 --> 16:26.129
PAIGE:
What are you doing?

16:26.130 --> 16:27.329
HAPPY: It's like blue boxing
in the '70s.

16:27.332 --> 16:28.998
Scratching the coin
on the transmitter

16:29.000 --> 16:32.201
generates a 2600 hertz tone.

16:32.203 --> 16:34.403
To this old system,
that tone is code

16:34.405 --> 16:36.204
to open a line.
(dial tone sounds)

16:36.206 --> 16:38.272
Well, lookie here.

16:39.808 --> 16:40.940
(speed dial beeps)

16:40.942 --> 16:42.408
TOBY:
If the kidnapping target

16:42.410 --> 16:43.942
needs a monthly transfusion,

16:43.944 --> 16:45.910
it would normally happen
at the closest hospital

16:45.912 --> 16:47.077
with an extensive
blood bank.

16:47.079 --> 16:49.045
Only a few matches there.

16:49.047 --> 16:51.881
Okay, cross-referencing now
with the rare blood type.

16:51.883 --> 16:53.883
South Nevada Hospital.

16:53.885 --> 16:57.853
Loading transfusion
patient names now...

16:57.855 --> 16:59.020
Loading slowly...

16:59.022 --> 17:00.287
He's searching.

17:00.289 --> 17:02.322
Oh, this would be an opportunity

17:02.324 --> 17:03.956
to ask him how
Megan's doing.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.457
Uh...
What?

17:05.459 --> 17:07.926
Oh, uh, I've got a name.

17:07.928 --> 17:09.928
Dr. Ivan Zahn.

17:09.930 --> 17:12.530
Uzbek national
who defected 13 years ago.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.999
He currently leads a team
at Coughlan Air Force Base

17:15.001 --> 17:16.867
in the computer
engineering division.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.435
His expertise is in

17:18.437 --> 17:20.503
high-capacity compression
and storage.

17:20.505 --> 17:23.038
He's considered by many
to be the best in his field.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.239
Okay, based on
his scientific field,

17:24.241 --> 17:25.306
Dr. Zahn's office is located

17:25.308 --> 17:27.474
in Laboratory Five of "C" Wing.

17:27.476 --> 17:29.175
Sly, hang in there.
Okay.

17:30.945 --> 17:32.311
Honestly, I think I'm
figuring this place out.

17:32.313 --> 17:34.012
Why people are
so scared of it.

17:34.014 --> 17:35.880
It's the mystique.
Come up on a stairwell,

17:35.882 --> 17:38.015
which opens to a door
just outside "C" Wing.

17:38.017 --> 17:39.149
Say a place is full of secrets

17:39.151 --> 17:40.550
and imagination takes over.

17:40.552 --> 17:42.351
Hence, little green men.
Your point?

17:42.353 --> 17:45.020
This place is no scarier
than any other Air Force base.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.888
We just waltzed in here.

17:46.890 --> 17:47.889
SOLIDER:
Hold it!

17:47.891 --> 17:48.890
Nobody move!

17:48.892 --> 17:50.958
(guns cocking)

17:52.094 --> 17:54.494
I have an envelope
in my pocket predicting this.

17:56.197 --> 17:59.298
Okay, almost into
the navigation system.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.966
A couple more moments,

18:00.968 --> 18:03.969
we will know
the plane's destination.

18:03.971 --> 18:07.105
Know that we're here
for Megan.

18:07.107 --> 18:10.074
But in the end, what if
that's just not enough?

18:10.076 --> 18:12.109
Almost finished.

18:12.111 --> 18:14.911
I don't want you to go
into this flat-footed.

18:14.913 --> 18:16.412
Could take you years
to get over.

18:16.414 --> 18:18.947
I know that you've suffered
tremendous loss,

18:18.949 --> 18:21.082
but this is different.

18:21.084 --> 18:23.017
There's time to find a solution.

18:25.121 --> 18:27.921
You got something to say
to Megan, you should say it.

18:27.923 --> 18:30.456
Spend your time
making memories.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.125
Don't bury yourself in
"solutions" that may not work.

18:33.127 --> 18:35.360
(typing rapidly)

18:37.097 --> 18:38.930
Plane's headed
to Uzbekistan.

18:38.932 --> 18:41.132
And I'm certain
it will work.

18:41.134 --> 18:44.168
One person can take care
of Megan: me.

18:46.338 --> 18:47.337
(sighs)

18:47.339 --> 18:48.404
Okay, son.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.874
Let's clear out
of this plane now.

18:55.578 --> 18:57.411
Walter, what's
the holdup?

18:57.413 --> 18:59.446
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.948
One second.

19:01.950 --> 19:04.116
(Walter laughs)

19:04.118 --> 19:05.884
Oh, God...

19:05.885 --> 19:07.651
Storage capacity on this
is almost two petabytes.

19:07.654 --> 19:10.988
Shouldn't be possible
for a machine this small.

19:10.990 --> 19:13.056
It's ten years ahead of
anything else on the market.

19:14.893 --> 19:16.359
Camera...

19:16.361 --> 19:17.360
Cabe...

19:17.362 --> 19:19.962
the camera equipment Happy saw?

19:19.964 --> 19:23.131
This plane is used
to spy on American cities.

19:25.168 --> 19:28.502
And they're flying in secret
back to Area 51.

19:28.504 --> 19:32.105
It's a safe bet that technology
was developed there.

19:32.107 --> 19:33.973
By the guy
that they're looking to kidnap.

19:33.975 --> 19:35.374
With this prototype
and the inventor,

19:35.376 --> 19:37.042
they could make a whole
fleet of planes.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.276
Sell it to every
hostile government

19:38.278 --> 19:40.578
in the world.
(vehicle approaching)

19:44.984 --> 19:47.217
Didn't I tell
you to move?

19:58.463 --> 20:01.464
Put him in the hold.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.939
I think we found
our kidnap victim.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.974
(plane engines whirring,
powering up)

20:13.976 --> 20:15.308
Oh, my God...

20:29.190 --> 20:31.557
♪ ♪

20:31.559 --> 20:33.492
Agent Cabe Gallo's
right over that ridge.

20:33.494 --> 20:35.160
He'll confirm
we're with Homeland.

20:35.162 --> 20:36.961
These cuffs are a little tight.
Is that necessary?

20:36.963 --> 20:38.429
Please shut up, sir!

20:38.431 --> 20:40.164
Okay, did you even bother
checking on Dr. Zahn?

20:40.166 --> 20:41.498
The man is in danger.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.267
Doctor's on base some weeks,
gone for others.

20:44.269 --> 20:46.135
But I do appreciate your attempt

20:46.137 --> 20:48.170
to bolster
this cockamamie story.

20:48.172 --> 20:49.571
You'll be eating that tone soon.

20:55.078 --> 20:56.577
They were here an hour ago.

20:56.579 --> 20:58.245
Where are they?

20:58.247 --> 21:00.480
HAPPY:
They still on the plane?

21:00.482 --> 21:02.114
The secret CIA plane?

21:02.116 --> 21:04.116
Okay, if they are,
things have gone severely south.

21:04.118 --> 21:05.350
We need to find them.

21:05.352 --> 21:06.835
We can't lose time.

21:06.836 --> 21:08.319
Oh, you'll have plenty
of time in the brig.

21:08.321 --> 21:10.254
I-I can see how this may
look bad, but it's the truth.

21:10.256 --> 21:12.022
I'm not trying to discount
your story, Doctor.

21:12.024 --> 21:16.026
This base has seen its share
of run-ins with rogue men.

21:16.028 --> 21:18.228
Small green men.

21:18.230 --> 21:19.996
PAIGE: Our boss is
Deputy Director

21:19.998 --> 21:22.231
of Homeland Security
Katherine Cooper.

21:22.233 --> 21:24.299
She'll sort this out.

21:24.301 --> 21:26.301
Yes, of course.

21:26.303 --> 21:27.769
Yes, thank you, ma'am.

21:27.771 --> 21:29.303
Sorry for the bother.

21:29.305 --> 21:30.504
Thank you.

21:31.773 --> 21:34.039
Okay.

21:34.041 --> 21:36.408
Well, according to
Deputy Director Cooper,

21:36.410 --> 21:39.411
Homeland team known as Scorpion

21:39.413 --> 21:41.679
are updating data servers
in Barstow.

21:42.648 --> 21:43.680
So who the hell are you?

21:43.682 --> 21:44.948
We're Scorpion.

21:44.949 --> 21:46.215
I'm a world-renowned
behaviorist.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.416
I have a 178 IQ.

21:47.418 --> 21:49.217
170.

21:49.219 --> 21:50.418
Barstow was our cover story.

21:50.420 --> 21:51.519
It was the CIA's idea.

21:51.521 --> 21:53.387
Right.

21:53.389 --> 21:54.388
Put 'em in a cell.

21:54.390 --> 21:55.589
Uh...
What?!

22:01.396 --> 22:02.728
Heartbeat's strong.

22:02.730 --> 22:04.329
He's sedated but alive.

22:06.032 --> 22:08.032
Luckily, this
was designed

22:08.034 --> 22:11.201
to keep us out, not in.

22:11.203 --> 22:13.203
We got to take control
of this plane.

22:13.205 --> 22:14.755
That means taking out one
of the agents in the cockpit

22:14.756 --> 22:16.306
and forcing the other one
to fly us back to Coughlan.

22:16.308 --> 22:17.373
Yeah.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.380
Easier if we
divide and conquer.

22:25.382 --> 22:27.515
I could reprogram
the plane's flight path

22:27.517 --> 22:29.517
from this control panel,

22:29.519 --> 22:31.519
reroute us straight back to Coughlan.
Great.

22:31.521 --> 22:34.788
Yeah, it would be great
if Happy were here.

22:34.790 --> 22:37.323
(groans) I'll never get
this lock open without tools.

22:39.593 --> 22:41.626
Then plan B.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.396
(alarm beeping)

22:46.398 --> 22:48.398
Temperature control
in the cargo hold.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.166
I'll check on it.

22:57.474 --> 22:59.407
How'd you get buckled in?

23:05.080 --> 23:06.846
Sorry about that.

23:06.848 --> 23:09.114
(indistinct radio chatter)

23:22.495 --> 23:25.229
TOBY:
I knew it.

23:25.231 --> 23:27.231
I did, I wrote it down.

23:27.233 --> 23:28.365
What good's a promise of money

23:28.367 --> 23:30.100
if Walter's murdered
by rogue spies?

23:30.102 --> 23:31.734
Curtis, your pie hole, shut it.

23:31.736 --> 23:34.269
Guys, we can get out
of this, right?

23:34.271 --> 23:36.404
Maybe not, this is a
state-of-the-art R & D facility,

23:36.406 --> 23:38.039
meaning everything
is state of the art.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.673
This electromagnetic lock
has a pound force of over 4,000.

23:39.675 --> 23:41.675
Double what I've ever seen.

23:41.677 --> 23:42.609
Oh, that's great.

23:42.611 --> 23:43.710
The one lock you've never seen.

23:43.712 --> 23:46.112
PAIGE: Okay, do
what we always do.

23:46.114 --> 23:47.713
Embrace the unknown
with cold facts.

23:47.715 --> 23:49.815
Someone installed this lock,
then someone can uninstall it.

23:49.817 --> 23:53.552
It shouldn't matter that you
haven't seen this one before.

23:53.554 --> 23:56.254
Okay, hold on, that might be it.

23:56.256 --> 23:57.888
This base is full of things
we've never seen.

23:57.890 --> 24:00.123
If Sly's right
about microwaves

24:00.125 --> 24:02.291
floating around the base
as part of the defense system,

24:02.293 --> 24:05.260
I could use a cell phone
to channel the waves

24:05.262 --> 24:07.228
into the lock
and short-circuit the mechanism.

24:07.230 --> 24:08.395
Then what?

24:08.397 --> 24:10.864
There's literally
an army sitting outside.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.232
We get out, hit the stairwell,

24:12.233 --> 24:13.599
and go to the roof
where the comm dishes are.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.152
Then we can knock out a dish,

24:15.153 --> 24:16.703
poke out a tiny hole in the
base's cone of silence.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.837
Like a, like a hole
in the ozone layer.

24:17.839 --> 24:19.238
Then we can contact Sylvester?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.839
He'll find the plane
and Cabe and Walt.

24:20.841 --> 24:22.407
You said we need a cell phone.

24:22.409 --> 24:23.608
Toby's phone, actually.

24:23.610 --> 24:25.476
Your crippling
gambling problem's

24:25.478 --> 24:27.428
left you unable
to afford nice things,

24:27.429 --> 24:29.379
like the latest cell technology,
but yours is old enough

24:29.381 --> 24:30.713
to have a nickel
cadmium battery.

24:30.715 --> 24:33.549
Insulted, hurt,
but glad to help.

24:33.551 --> 24:35.817
Except all of our cell phones
are in an evidence box.

24:38.922 --> 24:41.756
Remember your disgusting habit?

24:41.758 --> 24:42.823
Which one?

24:42.825 --> 24:44.891
I'm gonna need you to elaborate.

24:44.893 --> 24:46.726
SARDO (over intercom): Shultz,
get back here and buckle in.

24:46.728 --> 24:49.695
Turbulence ahead.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.697
I'm heading
into the cockpit.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.832
It's time to turn
this plane around.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.633
Okay.
Wait at the panel.

24:55.635 --> 24:57.668
HAPPY: Okay, window's
thick, but not soundproof.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.169
We got to be careful.

25:01.606 --> 25:02.671
PAIGE: All right.

25:02.673 --> 25:04.472
Focus.

25:04.474 --> 25:06.640
I'm a little rusty
on my hooking storage bins

25:06.642 --> 25:08.742
with dental floss skills.

25:20.621 --> 25:21.720
Ooh.

25:22.422 --> 25:23.487
Oop...

25:41.673 --> 25:44.407
Oh, I haven't even
used all my minutes.

25:56.653 --> 25:57.918
(beeping)

25:57.920 --> 26:00.787
Walter.

26:00.789 --> 26:02.355
Cabe!

26:04.392 --> 26:05.791
SARDO:
Put the gun down.

26:05.793 --> 26:07.526
Not unless you turn
this plane around.

26:07.528 --> 26:08.693
That's not gonna happen.

26:08.695 --> 26:10.661
Either this plane lands
in Uzbekistan

26:10.663 --> 26:12.295
or it crashes
into a mountain.

26:12.297 --> 26:13.596
The autopilot I programmed

26:13.598 --> 26:15.364
has us heading straight
into Boundary Peak.

26:15.366 --> 26:18.700
Digital cyanide pill--
classic CIA.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.268
I'd drop the weapon.

26:20.270 --> 26:21.969
I can override his passcode
and reroute it.

26:21.971 --> 26:22.970
Shoot him, Cabe!
Shoot him!

26:22.972 --> 26:24.504
(alarm beeping)

26:31.812 --> 26:33.711
Nothing's happening.

26:33.713 --> 26:35.846
It is-- I switched the antenna
from receiver mode to broadcast.

26:35.848 --> 26:38.682
It's channeling energy straight
from the battery into the lock.

26:38.684 --> 26:39.983
Well, how do you know
it's working?

26:39.985 --> 26:42.785
Stick your hand
in front of the phone.

26:42.787 --> 26:43.786
(sizzling)

26:43.788 --> 26:45.287
Oh!

26:45.289 --> 26:46.321
It's working.

26:46.323 --> 26:49.357
(lock clicking)

27:13.883 --> 27:15.749
Well, there's microwaves
up here, too!

27:15.751 --> 27:17.751
We can use the phone
to short-circuit the dish.

27:17.753 --> 27:19.853
No, the dishes aren't
electromagnetic!

27:19.855 --> 27:22.989
Then take it off broadcast mode,
cut off its transmissions,

27:22.991 --> 27:25.424
so we can call Sylvester.
HAPPY: Uh, no, the best way

27:25.426 --> 27:27.759
to interrupt the airwaves
is to interfere with the--

27:27.761 --> 27:30.327
Or that.

27:32.698 --> 27:34.798
Okay... I got a signal!

27:34.800 --> 27:36.633
I'm calling Sly.

27:36.635 --> 27:38.434
Coughlan launches
a dozen drone flights a day.

27:38.436 --> 27:39.935
I should be able
to hack into one from here.

27:39.937 --> 27:41.736
Okay, if you adjust
its frequencies,

27:41.738 --> 27:43.904
you can scan the plane's
gamma ray signature,

27:43.906 --> 27:46.006
and you can locate it
like we did this morning.

27:46.008 --> 27:47.840
Got one!
Hacking in now.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.577
Cabe, keys, keys!

27:52.579 --> 27:54.445
Little busy here!

28:00.919 --> 28:01.918
What are you doing?!

28:01.920 --> 28:04.453
I'm putting us into a nosedive.

28:04.455 --> 28:07.322
Plane's rotation will cause a
g-force acceleration giving us

28:07.324 --> 28:10.625
roughly 20 seconds of
weightlessness-- you hold on!

28:10.627 --> 28:13.327
You're killing us!

28:14.330 --> 28:15.595
(alarms buzzing, whooping)

28:20.935 --> 28:22.801
(alarms continuing)

28:44.857 --> 28:46.990
WALTER: Rerouting us!

28:46.992 --> 28:48.024
Ha!

28:48.026 --> 28:49.725
18 seconds.

28:49.727 --> 28:51.893
Weightlessness almost over.

29:02.004 --> 29:04.604
We need to get to the cockpit!

29:04.606 --> 29:06.472
We got to level this off!

29:09.043 --> 29:10.909
SYLVESTER: Found the plane.

29:10.911 --> 29:12.777
Okay, where are they?

29:12.779 --> 29:14.044
Over Nevada,
near the White Mountains.

29:14.046 --> 29:15.912
They're descending.

29:15.914 --> 29:17.113
Guys, I think
they're in a nosedive.

29:17.115 --> 29:19.982
(alarms buzzing, whooping)

29:22.953 --> 29:23.918
Okay...

29:23.920 --> 29:25.586
Okay.

29:25.588 --> 29:27.988
CABE: Any chance that g-force
thing you were talking about

29:27.990 --> 29:29.456
might be making us lightheaded?

29:29.458 --> 29:32.992
It could cause us
to pass out.

29:49.809 --> 29:50.808
Guys, this is not good.

29:50.810 --> 29:52.643
Are you sure it's
not landing?

29:52.645 --> 29:54.177
SYLVESTER:
<i> I have never seen anything</i>

29:54.179 --> 29:55.578
intentionally land
at that angle.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.746
Get us an image
of the plane.

29:57.748 --> 29:59.581
I'm positioning
drone cameras now.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.485
Move into the cockpit.

30:07.856 --> 30:09.188
Oh, my God!

30:09.190 --> 30:10.940
G-force must've
knocked them out.

30:10.941 --> 30:12.691
They'll regain consciousness
if the plane levels out.

30:12.693 --> 30:13.725
Okay, Sly,
can you use the drone

30:13.727 --> 30:15.560
to hack into the plane
to level it?

30:15.562 --> 30:17.194
That is what I am trying
to do right now.

30:19.198 --> 30:20.564
Okay, Walter left the backdoor

30:20.566 --> 30:22.566
open in the system--
I am in.

30:22.568 --> 30:25.435
Secret spy plane hacking
protections, in your face!

30:25.437 --> 30:27.570
SYLVESTER:
Walter? Cabe?

30:27.572 --> 30:29.505
Walter, wake up!

30:29.507 --> 30:31.707
Not now, Sylvester.
It's too early.

30:31.709 --> 30:33.208
Hurry!
They're gonna crash!

30:33.210 --> 30:34.709
No, Walter, you need
to wake up right now!

30:34.711 --> 30:36.777
(both gasping, grunting)

30:40.549 --> 30:42.549
(alarms buzzing, whooping)

30:48.623 --> 30:51.156
Whew! Whew!

30:51.158 --> 30:52.991
(Walter chuckles)

30:52.993 --> 30:55.526
Sylvester,
how are you talking to us?

30:55.528 --> 30:56.927
Look outside
your starboard window.

30:58.230 --> 31:00.230
(over radio):
That's me.

31:00.232 --> 31:01.698
Can you get us to Coughlan?

31:01.700 --> 31:03.566
I reprogrammed the
navigation system

31:03.568 --> 31:05.701
to send us to the
last grounded location.

31:05.703 --> 31:09.571
But, uh, you know, this
may come as a sur-surprise,

31:09.573 --> 31:10.738
but, um,

31:10.740 --> 31:12.639
I don't know how
to land a plane.

31:14.643 --> 31:16.609
HAPPY: I can walk you through this.
Happy?

31:16.611 --> 31:18.777
Okay, don't worry,
this will be a piece of cake.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.548
TOBY:
Aliens?

31:23.550 --> 31:25.582
Oh, man.
LIEUTENANT: Hands up!

31:27.819 --> 31:30.752
Drop that phone.

31:33.256 --> 31:35.222
Happy, hello, are you there?

31:35.224 --> 31:36.723
(alarm resumes)

31:36.725 --> 31:39.959
CABE: Happy, we're low on fuel.
We need to land.

31:39.961 --> 31:41.260
HAPPY:
A large-body aircraft

31:41.262 --> 31:42.751
is headed straight for this base

31:42.752 --> 31:44.241
and the guy who's flying it--
he doesn't know

31:44.242 --> 31:45.731
what the hell he's doing.
It's gonna crash right into us

31:45.733 --> 31:47.699
if you don't give her back that phone.
I admit I admire

31:47.701 --> 31:49.567
your tenacity with this story.

31:49.569 --> 31:51.569
You can verify it.
You have the equipment.

31:51.571 --> 31:52.937
Okay, you know what?
As soon as it's done,

31:52.939 --> 31:54.405
you can put the cuffs back on.

31:54.406 --> 31:55.872
But that plane is entering
into Coughlan airspace

31:55.875 --> 31:58.575
in less than ten seconds
whether you believe me or not.

32:00.545 --> 32:01.877
Check the tower.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.111
Meanwhile, let's get you cozy.

32:04.981 --> 32:07.715
Happy? Happy?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.583
(siren wailing) MAN (over P.A.): Sir,
we see a heavy aircraft directly headed

32:09.585 --> 32:12.085
for the base. All right,
scramble three fighters.

32:12.087 --> 32:13.619
Let's shoot this thing
out of the sky.

32:13.621 --> 32:15.337
Are you crazy?

32:15.338 --> 32:17.054
Given its current trajectory,
shooting that plane

32:17.057 --> 32:19.023
will turn it into a
flying ball of fire

32:19.025 --> 32:20.624
headed straight
for this place.

32:20.626 --> 32:22.692
Unless you let me land
it safely in the desert.

32:26.564 --> 32:28.196
Happy, we can
see the landing strip.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.730
What do we do?

32:32.201 --> 32:33.800
Fighters stand down.

32:34.969 --> 32:36.234
They're keeping
their guns on you,

32:36.236 --> 32:37.735
so you better be for real.

32:39.538 --> 32:41.170
HAPPY:
Okay, keep it above 180 knots,

32:41.172 --> 32:42.704
pull back the throttle,

32:42.706 --> 32:43.938
the knob between the seats.

32:43.940 --> 32:45.606
Shift it back about halfway.

32:45.608 --> 32:47.674
Okay.
Okay, now gradually

32:47.676 --> 32:49.742
start pulling back
on the control stick.

32:51.812 --> 32:53.111
(Walter grunting with effort)

32:53.113 --> 32:54.178
Doing that now.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.813
Okay, you need
to deploy the flaps.

32:56.815 --> 32:59.215
There should be a handle
next to the throttle.

32:59.217 --> 33:01.917
Pull it back 15%
and move it slowly to 40.

33:01.919 --> 33:03.318
When you hit the ground

33:03.320 --> 33:04.919
kick the throttle into idle.

33:04.921 --> 33:06.587
Holding steady.

33:11.126 --> 33:13.159
Uh, we're coming in too sharp.

33:13.161 --> 33:14.793
We're coming in
too sharp!

33:14.795 --> 33:16.728
Walt, pull back.

33:16.730 --> 33:18.796
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

33:18.798 --> 33:21.165
Brace for impact!

33:33.211 --> 33:35.744
(engines whirring,
powering down)

33:35.746 --> 33:36.778
(panting)

33:36.780 --> 33:38.045
We made it.

33:38.047 --> 33:41.348
I just want to sit here.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.717
I just want one minute of quiet.

33:43.719 --> 33:47.687
Get your hands up!
Hands up!

33:47.689 --> 33:50.222
It was nice while it lasted.

33:50.224 --> 33:52.724
You okay?

33:52.726 --> 33:54.258
We're fine, why?

33:54.260 --> 33:56.860
I saw you guys on that roof,
when the shadow crossed you.

33:56.862 --> 33:58.695
You were thinking alien.

33:58.697 --> 34:01.731
And the unknown
scared the hell out of you.

34:01.733 --> 34:02.732
Did not.

34:02.734 --> 34:03.899
Nice try.

34:05.736 --> 34:07.502
SOLIDER:
Right this way, sir.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.269
Okay, that's got to be the most
confused scientist in the world.

34:09.272 --> 34:11.372
Let's go!

34:11.374 --> 34:13.640
(Hummer engines start)

34:20.614 --> 34:22.780
So, uh, money.

34:22.782 --> 34:24.648
Yeah,

34:24.650 --> 34:26.816
wire transfer
would be preferable.

34:26.818 --> 34:29.118
Oh, you know what?
I'd also love...

34:29.120 --> 34:31.153
(chuckles)

34:31.155 --> 34:32.988
...love an audience
with Dr. Zahn.

34:32.990 --> 34:34.789
He designed
this device.

34:34.791 --> 34:36.757
I'm working on a project and
I really think that I could...

34:36.759 --> 34:38.358
open up...

34:38.360 --> 34:40.693
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:40.695 --> 34:41.694
What the hell?

34:41.696 --> 34:43.095
You nosed around a bit too deep

34:43.097 --> 34:44.763
in the mission of this plane.

34:44.765 --> 34:46.864
I'm afraid you know
a little too much.

34:50.169 --> 34:53.003
I gotta say,
I didn't see this coming.

34:53.005 --> 34:54.804
This one's on me.

35:02.179 --> 35:04.979
Obviously, I'd prefer
not to kill you.

35:04.981 --> 35:06.981
But unfortunately, Mr. O'Brien
knows information

35:06.983 --> 35:09.783
I really can't
have getting out.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.020
NSA spying might've been
shut down, but yours

35:14.022 --> 35:15.321
is expanding.
TOBY: The rest of us

35:15.323 --> 35:16.922
don't know anything
about this plane.

35:16.924 --> 35:18.823
In fact, I was hardly
even on this plane.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.924
Plane? What-what plane?

35:19.926 --> 35:20.925
Toby!

35:20.927 --> 35:21.992
Let's go for a ride.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.259
No, no.

35:23.261 --> 35:25.361
Before we head out
to what is unquestionably

35:25.363 --> 35:27.296
a large hole in the desert,

35:27.298 --> 35:30.666
6,000 feet above
our heads is a drone,

35:30.668 --> 35:31.800
operated by our friend

35:31.802 --> 35:33.768
Sylvester. Oh...

35:33.770 --> 35:36.137
He's filming and recording
this conversation.

35:36.139 --> 35:39.073
And if you kill us...

35:39.075 --> 35:40.774
you go away for murder.

35:40.776 --> 35:42.341
That's good.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.946
Oh, I'm guessing by now
he's downloaded this footage

35:48.948 --> 35:51.348
to dozens of servers
around the country.

35:52.818 --> 35:53.917
You're bluffing.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.953
Walter, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

35:56.955 --> 35:58.955
I'd say he's gonna prove you
wrong by getting that drone

35:58.957 --> 36:01.157
to give you a buzz cut
in eight seconds. Seven,

36:01.159 --> 36:02.358
six,

36:02.360 --> 36:04.259
five, four,

36:04.261 --> 36:06.427
three, two...

36:06.429 --> 36:08.262
SYLVESTER: The drone interface
is malfunctioning!

36:08.264 --> 36:10.831
...one.

36:11.967 --> 36:14.834
Can I interest you
in a card trick?

36:21.742 --> 36:22.807
Oh, no!

36:24.977 --> 36:26.042
WILLIS: Get eyes on that.

36:26.044 --> 36:29.145
You'll note
its high-sensitivity camera

36:29.147 --> 36:30.913
and long-distance microphone.

36:39.022 --> 36:42.023
Walter, I hope Mr. CIA is being
nice, because the drone's camera

36:42.025 --> 36:45.159
stopped functioning and I can't
hear a word you're saying.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.361
Stand down, gentlemen.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.231
Well, we should be going now.

36:51.233 --> 36:53.032
HAPPY: Oh, wait,
wait a minute--

36:53.034 --> 36:56.368
we've got the CIA
by the yabos.

36:56.370 --> 37:00.338
We're missing out on the
opportunity of a lifetime here.

37:00.340 --> 37:03.841
Okay, in April of '71,
there was a video--

37:03.843 --> 37:04.908
an elliptical-shaped object

37:04.910 --> 37:06.109
that was spotted
over Phoenix,

37:06.111 --> 37:08.010
then suddenly
disappeared midair.

37:08.012 --> 37:09.344
What was it?

37:09.346 --> 37:10.978
We still don't know.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.145
Where's Hoffa?

37:12.147 --> 37:13.813
The Meadowlands.
Everyone knows that.

37:13.815 --> 37:14.880
JFK?

37:14.882 --> 37:16.982
Don't push it.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.017
All right, let's head out, gang.

37:20.987 --> 37:22.353
I'm gonna take this.

37:26.992 --> 37:29.425
(train horn blowing in distance)

37:38.769 --> 37:41.469
The storage capacity
is astounding.

37:41.471 --> 37:43.003
I'm pretty sure
my concept

37:43.005 --> 37:45.238
will move from
theory to reality

37:45.240 --> 37:47.139
very quickly.

37:49.076 --> 37:50.942
I learned something today,
about the team.

37:50.944 --> 37:52.961
You know the idea

37:52.962 --> 37:54.979
that nature always fills
an empty space?

37:54.981 --> 37:57.281
"Nature abhors a vacuum."
Aristotle.

37:57.283 --> 37:59.049
Yeah, well, it really

37:59.051 --> 38:00.850
applies to the genius mind.

38:00.852 --> 38:03.786
You all have a real fear
of the unknown.

38:03.788 --> 38:05.287
You really struggle
with anything

38:05.289 --> 38:08.023
you can't prove
or explain.

38:08.025 --> 38:11.092
There's nothing that
we really can't explain.

38:11.094 --> 38:14.094
What about death?

38:17.265 --> 38:19.265
It is the breakdown
of the biological functions

38:19.267 --> 38:20.799
that support life.

38:20.801 --> 38:22.433
See, you-you throw science

38:22.435 --> 38:24.501
at things that
should be emotional.

38:24.503 --> 38:28.071
We process the world
differently from most people.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.138
That's all it is.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.939
You know, and truthfully,

38:30.941 --> 38:33.308
I know exactly what's
going on with Megan.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.877
There is a process to life

38:35.879 --> 38:37.545
that ends in an unknown.

38:40.082 --> 38:42.082
Toby.

38:42.084 --> 38:44.084
What?

38:44.086 --> 38:46.953
Can you explain
Megan's condition as it stands?

38:46.955 --> 38:49.388
She has a bacterial infection
in her lungs. A pneumonia.

38:49.390 --> 38:50.989
Why is that?

38:50.991 --> 38:52.223
She has scarred, damaged lungs.

38:52.225 --> 38:53.857
Why?

38:53.859 --> 38:56.459
She's inhaled small amounts
of food and saliva

38:56.461 --> 38:58.594
that, over time, have
damaged her lungs.  Mm-hmm.

38:58.596 --> 38:59.928
Why is that happening?

38:59.930 --> 39:02.430
Uh, she can't swallow very well

39:02.432 --> 39:04.131
because of the MS.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.932
Uh, explain.

39:05.934 --> 39:07.500
The MS damaged some nerves

39:07.502 --> 39:09.268
in her brain,
probably her medulla.

39:09.270 --> 39:11.103
How come?
Her own immune system

39:11.105 --> 39:14.039
attacked the myelin sheaths
around the nerves.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.173
Thank you, Toby.

39:15.175 --> 39:16.407
(clicks off)

39:16.409 --> 39:19.842
See? We know everything
we need to know.

39:21.579 --> 39:24.146
(clicks on)
Toby...

39:24.148 --> 39:27.883
why is her own body
attacking her nerves?

39:29.419 --> 39:32.218
You know, we don't know.

39:34.155 --> 39:35.220
(clicks off)

39:39.192 --> 39:42.125
I'm just trying to help.

39:43.928 --> 39:45.427
I need to go.

39:47.364 --> 39:49.530
(grunts)
Wasn't it you that said,

39:49.532 --> 39:52.298
the first time that we met,
that we save everybody?

39:54.035 --> 39:56.902
I am going to save

39:56.904 --> 39:58.970
my sister.

40:13.152 --> 40:16.086
I just spoke to the doctor.
Why is she not on a respirator?

40:16.088 --> 40:17.220
He says it's her best chance.

40:17.222 --> 40:18.921
She didn't want to go on it.

40:18.923 --> 40:20.239
Well, it's your job
to convince her.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.556
She's sick;
she's not thinking clearly.

40:21.558 --> 40:22.990
She was thinking.

40:22.992 --> 40:24.391
I trusted you.

40:24.393 --> 40:26.960
You promised me you would
do the right thing.

40:26.962 --> 40:29.462
I did do the right thing.
For Megan.

40:29.464 --> 40:31.130
She doesn't want
to prolong her state,

40:31.132 --> 40:32.631
so I respected her wishes.

40:32.633 --> 40:35.166
Don't go head to head
with me on this.

40:35.168 --> 40:37.668
You've known her for a year,

40:37.670 --> 40:40.203
I've known her my whole life.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.305
I love her just as much.

40:42.307 --> 40:45.174
And I am sorry, Walter,
but you are wrong.

40:54.317 --> 40:56.150
Fine.
