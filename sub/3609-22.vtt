00:02.003 --> 00:03.789
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.880 --> 00:05.290
That's a satellite phone.

00:05.381 --> 00:06.917
From where did you take off?

00:07.008 --> 00:10.671
A freighter.
About 80 nautical miles west of here.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.672
I'm part of a search-and-recovery team.

00:12.763 --> 00:16.096
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations
to block all the signals.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.550
It's an underwater Dharma station.
We swim in.

00:18.644 --> 00:19.679
I'll do it.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.352
While I'm gone, don't worry about me.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.272
How long will it take you
to reach their camp?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.771
If I take my ten best
we can hit them by nightfall.

00:27.862 --> 00:31.070
If any of them are stupid enough
to get in your way, kill them.

00:32.783 --> 00:36.867
We camouflage the dynamite next to
the tents, target it from the tree line.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.696
When your people show up tomorrow
we'll be ready.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.374
- No, they're coming tonight!
- You lead everyone to the radio tower.

00:43.461 --> 00:46.203
Can't risk losing the chance
to contact Naomi's boat.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.333
Everything has to happen
at the same time.

00:48.424 --> 00:49.834
What I saw, Charlie,

00:49.926 --> 00:53.510
was Claire and her baby getting into
a helicopter that leaves this island.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.461
This time, you have to die.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.263
If you don't, there won't be any rescue.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.893
[coughing] I'm alive!

01:06.984 --> 01:09.976
- [metallic door clangs open]
- [guns cocking]

01:28.130 --> 01:30.416
Would you put your seatback up, please?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.004
Would you fasten your seat belt, please?

01:34.637 --> 01:36.173
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.635
Can I get another one of those, please?

01:39.725 --> 01:42.216
I'm sorry, sir.
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.644
- Well, 20 minutes is a long time.
- How about a newspaper instead?

01:45.731 --> 01:48.017
And if you could
buckle your seat belt, sir?

01:48.943 --> 01:51.400
Please fasten your seat belt. Thank you.

01:53.948 --> 01:57.907
[turbulence]

01:57.994 --> 02:00.326
[intercom bell beeps]

02:00.413 --> 02:02.449
[pilot] Sorry about the bumps, folks.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.623
We ’re hitting warm air
as we descend into Los Ange/es.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.874
Please keep those seat belts fastened.
We'll have you on the ground shortly.

02:54.258 --> 02:57.671
[distant police siren]

03:18.866 --> 03:21.357
[cell phone dial tones]

03:21.452 --> 03:23.192
[ringing]

03:23.287 --> 03:27.701
[woman] You’ve reached 310-555-0148.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.623
Please leave a message.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.326
Hey. It's me.

03:39.095 --> 03:40.551
| just read...

04:51.292 --> 04:52.953
Oh, forgive me.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.412
[car tires screeching]

04:58.507 --> 05:01.874
[crash]

05:02.553 --> 05:05.966
[child] Mom! Mom! Mom!

05:06.557 --> 05:08.422
- [woman] Help!
- Mom!

05:36.420 --> 05:38.035
You have everything you need?

05:38.130 --> 05:40.963
No. But I've made the best
out of what we have.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.669
- Bernard and Jin?
- They're both excellent shots.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.595
And highly motivated.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.883
The dynamite's in place. We won't miss.

05:53.729 --> 05:56.892
Jack, no matter what happens here,
I want you to keep moving.

05:56.982 --> 06:01.442
Keep moving for that radio tower.
Don't turn back for any reason.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.021
I'm willing to give my life
if it means rescue.

06:05.115 --> 06:09.654
But I am not giving it up for nothing.
You understand?

06:14.083 --> 06:17.621
Yeah. I understand.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.921
- Then, good luck.
- You too.

06:34.937 --> 06:39.306
If I'd help you with your 808 sign,
would you change your mind?

06:39.400 --> 06:42.358
- No, ma'am.
- Then I want you to say it again.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.526
- Rose...
- Say it, Bernard.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.902
I am a dentist. I am not Rambo.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.984
And don't you forget it.

06:59.378 --> 07:03.417
[baby crying]

07:07.761 --> 07:11.800
- Charlie's gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Of course he is.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.927
[speaks Korean]

07:22.693 --> 07:24.604
[whimpering] Jin...

07:34.872 --> 07:39.036
Because we have to go home.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.100
All right.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.141
Let's do it.

08:55.411 --> 08:58.244
[Vincent barks]

09:16.265 --> 09:18.972
Jack, can I ask you a question?

09:19.601 --> 09:20.636
Sure.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.970
What did you do for a living
before you became Moses?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.894
- l was a doctor.
- Right. 'Course you were.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.692
Well, I need your attention
for a minute, doctor.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.400
Is she OK?

09:36.076 --> 09:39.989
- Why wouldn't she be?
- Because none of your people trust her.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.661
No offense.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.161
- Catch up to me when you're done.
- Juliet...

09:44.251 --> 09:45.331
Wsﬁne.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.591
I need to show you
how this gadget works,

09:51.675 --> 09:53.415
in case anything happens to me.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.717
You need to be able to call my boat.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.261
OK. Show me.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.805
It's actually simple. Turn her on here.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.600
This opens a direct channel
to the freighter.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.052
Give her a tap here,

10:05.147 --> 10:08.890
- wait for the beep and say hello.
- That's it?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.099
That's it.

10:10.194 --> 10:13.277
Once the rock star turns off
whatever's jamming us up,

10:13.363 --> 10:16.605
this red light will turn
a lovely shade of green.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.784
- That'll be any time now, yeah?
- Hopefully.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.614
[woman grunts]

10:33.717 --> 10:35.457
Who are you?

10:36.720 --> 10:40.338
Look, if you tell us how
you got down here, we won't hurt you.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.554
I came in my invisible submarine.
Don't you see it?

10:45.646 --> 10:49.059
- Hey! Take it easy.
- Take it easy? He's one of them!

10:50.818 --> 10:54.811
Why are you here?
How did you find out about this station?

10:57.533 --> 10:59.069
Juliet told us.

11:00.536 --> 11:03.994
She's one of us now,
in case you hadn't heard.

11:04.915 --> 11:05.995
Stop.

11:08.252 --> 11:12.291
- We gotta call Ben.
- Yeah.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.497
Let's call Ben.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.126
Come on.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.853
[Desmond] You're in a room
full of equipment.

11:33.944 --> 11:37.357
There's a blinking yellow light
above a switch.

11:37.447 --> 11:41.235
You flip the switch.
The light goes off.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.784
And you drown.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.291
[woman] Ben. Come in, Ben.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.299
- Hello?
- Ben. It’s Bonnie.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.636
Ben, are you there?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.304
Can you hear me, Ben?

12:06.852 --> 12:09.059
Why are you breaking radio silence?

12:09.146 --> 12:11.728
- One of them's down here.
- I'm sorry. What?

12:11.815 --> 12:15.524
We've got him tied up, but he's here.
One of them swam down here.

12:15.611 --> 12:18.023
- Who? Which one?
- He won't tell us.

12:18.113 --> 12:21.276
It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!

12:21.366 --> 12:23.402
HOW did...?

12:23.493 --> 12:26.906
- How does he know about the station?
- He said Juliet told them.

12:34.838 --> 12:38.456
All right, sit tight.
Don't do anything. I'm sending help.

12:38.550 --> 12:42.213
Go to the Looking Glass and find out
what Charlie is doing down there.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.341
You told us the Looking Glass
was inoperable, flooded.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.882
I lied.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.683
Mikhail, I need you to go, now!

12:51.813 --> 12:53.019
I can be there by dawn.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.316
But if Juliet told them
about the Looking Glass,

12:57.402 --> 12:59.233
what else did she tell them?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.240
[beeps]

13:06.328 --> 13:09.320
Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?

13:21.051 --> 13:23.087
- Your walkies all off?
- Yes, sir.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.799
Did you get a good look?

13:26.890 --> 13:30.883
The tents are marked with white coral.
Three of them. Juliet did herjob.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.014
All right. Let's do this.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.531
lt's empty!

14:31.621 --> 14:33.407
[man] Get away from the tent!

14:36.793 --> 14:38.374
- It's a trap!
- Please, God.

14:38.462 --> 14:39.793
Get away from the...

14:42.132 --> 14:43.463
Move! Move!

14:45.594 --> 14:47.550
Tree line!

14:59.483 --> 15:02.475
I got your man! Drop your weapons!

15:12.829 --> 15:14.740
I got your man!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.660
It's over!

15:19.669 --> 15:22.502
Don't. Finger off the trigger.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.258
Was that gunfire?

15:32.349 --> 15:36.183
There were supposed
to be three explosions.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.518
- Yeah.
- There was.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.979
It didn't work.

15:50.992 --> 15:55.281
[woman] Dr. Leon to surgery.
Dr. Leon to surgery.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.535
- There ya go. Good as new.
- Thanks.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.786
The news people are waiting outside.

16:00.877 --> 16:04.210
- You being a hero, and all.
- Great.

16:06.216 --> 16:09.959
- The woman, how is she?
- She's been stabilized.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.546
- Thank God you were on that bridge.
- Right.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.841
Sorry, no visitors in the ER.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.389
It's OK. She...

16:24.568 --> 16:25.808
We used to be married.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.019
Come on in.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.024
What happened?

16:36.163 --> 16:40.907
It was a... a car accident.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.366
Are you OK?

16:45.922 --> 16:48.413
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.425
Are you drinking again?

16:54.598 --> 16:55.838
- No.
- Are you, Jack?

16:55.932 --> 16:57.217
No.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.726
Why did you come down here, Sarah?

17:03.940 --> 17:07.432
I'm still listed
as your emergency contact.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.276
What were you doing driving around
at 2:00 in the morning?

17:36.181 --> 17:38.763
Do you think maybe
you could give me a lift home?

17:43.313 --> 17:45.804
I don't think that would be appropriate.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.903
Well...

17:53.949 --> 17:56.486
...thanks for coming down, Sarah.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.447
Goodbye, Jack.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.002
Why were there only two explosions?

18:17.097 --> 18:18.928
They didn't have to blow the third.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.506
- But those gunshots...
- It's OK, Rose.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.341
- Do you believe that?
- Listen,

18:23.436 --> 18:26.428
they had no idea
that we were waiting for them.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.855
Sayid's with your husbands.
They're fine.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.728
They're a couple hours behind us.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.856
Then we should wait for them here.
You go on...

18:33.947 --> 18:35.278
No one gets left behind.

18:35.365 --> 18:39.449
If you say, "Live together, die alone,"
I'm gonna punch you in your face.

18:41.496 --> 18:45.330
Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough.

18:45.417 --> 18:49.456
But we have a plan.
And for all we know, it worked.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.876
It's gonna be OK.
Everything's gonna be all right.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.256
Let's just keep moving, OK?

19:09.274 --> 19:11.230
It's OK. Let's go.

19:19.075 --> 19:23.569
I'm gonna ask you this one more time.
Why are you here?

19:26.458 --> 19:30.246
I'm here to turn off
yourjamming equipment.

19:30.337 --> 19:33.750
It's in there,
next to the flashing yellow light.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.003
- How do you know about that?
- I know because I know.

19:37.093 --> 19:40.426
Whatever you ladies do to me,
I'm going to turn it off.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.344
- You are?
- | most definitely am.

19:42.432 --> 19:46.016
- So, what's the code?
- What?

19:46.102 --> 19:49.185
Charlie, if you're gonna turn off
the jamming equipment,

19:49.272 --> 19:50.682
you're gonna need the code.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.106
And only three people know it:

19:53.193 --> 19:55.684
Me, her and Ben.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.651
Well, I guess I won't need the code,

20:04.746 --> 20:08.910
since this entire station's
gonna be flooded, anyway.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.039
I turn off your little jammer,

20:13.129 --> 20:15.461
and the helicopters
rescue all my friends.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.791
But if this station floods,
what happens to you?

20:23.932 --> 20:25.138
I die.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.230
- What?
- [Friend/y] They're all dead!

20:34.317 --> 20:38.276
Diane, Ivan, all of them, dead!
Shephard and his people, they're gone!

20:38.363 --> 20:40.069
- Gone? Where?
- I don't know!

20:40.156 --> 20:42.818
Did you hear me?
They killed seven of our...

20:42.909 --> 20:45.651
Tom! Calm down
and tell him the good news.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.237
- What good news?
- We caught three of 'em.

20:49.332 --> 20:53.325
The ones that stayed to blow up the
tents. Ben, they knew we were coming.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.537
It was Juliet. She betrayed us.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.293
- What?
- Just figure out where she is, Tom!

21:00.510 --> 21:04.344
Get up. OK, junior.
Where the hell did...?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.180
[Sayid groans]

21:08.977 --> 21:11.059
- They're not talking.
- Who do you have?

21:11.146 --> 21:13.683
Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.979
Shoot Kwon.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.938
- What?
- You want them to answer?

21:19.028 --> 21:20.438
Kill Kwon. Do it now.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.066
[speaks Korean]

21:22.157 --> 21:25.194
I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure it's lovely.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.942
- No! Wait! No!
- No! No talk!

21:28.037 --> 21:30.244
- Please!
- Talk to me. Nobody gets hurt.

21:30.331 --> 21:33.994
- Tell me where your people are.
- He's lying. He's going to kill us.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.168
Where are they?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.708
Sayonara.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.884
The radio tower.
They're hiking to a radio tower.

21:51.060 --> 21:55.224
- Why in the hell are they going there?
- A woman parachuted here.

21:55.899 --> 21:59.642
She has a satellite phone
and they're gonna call her ship.

21:59.736 --> 22:04.981
Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow.
So why were they waiting for us tonight?

22:05.074 --> 22:07.611
You heard him. How'd you know?

22:09.704 --> 22:14.414
A kid told us.
He came in a canoe and he warned us.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.582
What kid?

22:17.045 --> 22:19.001
Karl. He said his name was Karl.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.587
You heard that, Ben?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.166
Ben?

22:24.260 --> 22:25.670
I heard.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.306
What do you want us to do? Kill 'em?

22:38.775 --> 22:41.562
No. Not yet.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.952
We're going to the radio tower?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.779
Not we, Richard. Me.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.707
You're going to take everyone
to the Temple as planned.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.957
Now might not be the best time
to go tromping off on your own.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.127
And why not?

23:02.215 --> 23:03.830
People are asking questions.

23:03.925 --> 23:08.009
About leaving home, about
what happened to Locke, about Jacob.

23:09.180 --> 23:13.594
Not to mention the rumor that everyone
who went down to the beach is dead.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.175
They're not all dead.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.401
Where are you going?

23:22.485 --> 23:24.225
Hello, Alex.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.727
| asked where you were going.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.609
I thought I might go for a walk.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.817
See if I can't find Jack
and all his friends.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.490
I'm coming with you.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.409
- All right.
- What?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.161
I said, all right.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.334
In fact, I think it's a good idea.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.749
You do wanna see Karl again.
Don't you?

23:47.594 --> 23:50.301
Get your pack.
I'm leaving in ten minutes.

23:54.517 --> 23:57.054
There's 40 of them.
And you're alone.

23:57.145 --> 24:00.182
They're gonna do whatever it takes
to get off the island.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.015
What do you think's
gonna happen when you get there?

24:04.444 --> 24:06.150
I'm gonna talk them out of it.

24:35.183 --> 24:39.392
- Something's wrong.
- Lots of things are wrong, Kate.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.183
Jin, Bernard, Sayid,
they should've caught up to us by now.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.815
I wanna make sure they're all right.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.644
- 'Course you do.
- What's that supposed to mean?

24:48.738 --> 24:52.401
It means, Kate,
there's always someone to go back for.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.450
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.571
- Nothing?
- I'm fine.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.120
Why don't you just
tell me what happened?

25:06.089 --> 25:08.546
- What'd you do that for?
- To wake you up!

25:08.633 --> 25:12.876
Ever since you got that tape from Locke,
it's like you've been sleepwalking.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.177
You don't care about our friends? Fine.

25:15.264 --> 25:19.098
But it's like you don't care
about anything anymore.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.847
And since when
did you start calling me "Kate"?

25:26.442 --> 25:31.402
You know... they sent Juliet
to check out Sun.

25:34.784 --> 25:38.527
But she was there
to check and see if I'm pregnant too.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.531
Well, let's hope you're not.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.668
[people chattering]

25:53.636 --> 25:56.093
[baby crying]

25:58.516 --> 25:59.756
The light still red?

26:30.673 --> 26:34.336
[gunfire]

26:39.307 --> 26:40.592
[inhales deeply]

27:15.551 --> 27:17.963
[muffled shouting]

27:20.097 --> 27:22.474
[splashing]

27:22.558 --> 27:24.594
[gasping]

27:24.685 --> 27:26.812
Des! Des!

27:26.896 --> 27:29.808
Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?

27:29.899 --> 27:32.982
Not for long, if you don't
get out of here. You have to hide!

27:33.069 --> 27:36.402
There's people in there! Quick! Hide!
Hide! Hide! Go, go, go!

27:37.073 --> 27:38.904
Who's he talking to?

27:39.659 --> 27:44.198
[singing]

27:44.288 --> 27:47.906
- Who were you talking to?
- I wasn't talking. I was singing.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.084
[continues singing]

28:00.179 --> 28:02.761
- Shut up.
- Right. OK. You got it.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.132
Come on.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.591
Can I help you?

28:46.976 --> 28:48.557
Just checking her chart.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.727
I'm sorry, I'm Dr. Hamill. Rob.
The new chief of surgery.

28:51.814 --> 28:54.396
- I don't think we've met yet.
- Jack Shephard.

28:54.483 --> 28:58.226
Dr. Shephard, the hero. Twice over.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.658
After last night, I'm surprised
you'd even want to come in.

29:05.745 --> 29:09.829
Talk about right place, right time?
This woman is very lucky you were there.

29:09.916 --> 29:14.034
Then she wouldn't have a fractured back
that was impinging upon her spinal cord.

29:14.128 --> 29:17.746
I'd like to operate
first thing in the morning.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.170
- You want to operate?
- Yes.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.468
I'm sorry, Jack,
this isn't your patient.

29:24.555 --> 29:25.931
We are aware of the issues.

29:26.015 --> 29:29.223
Gary Nadler's doing
the surgery at 6:00am.

29:33.731 --> 29:37.644
With all due respect, Dr. Hamill,
I'd rather do it myself.

29:39.570 --> 29:44.860
Last night you pulled this woman's
eight-year-old son out of a flaming car,

29:44.951 --> 29:46.657
then you went back for her.

29:48.871 --> 29:52.614
- I think you've done enough.
- I wanna do this surgery.

29:53.751 --> 29:58.165
Look, everything's under control here.
She'll be fine.

29:58.255 --> 30:02.168
Go home. Have a drink. You deserve it.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.967
The chart please, Jack.

30:17.400 --> 30:21.313
You call me.
I want to know what happens.

30:28.911 --> 30:30.993
[woman speaking over loudspeaker]

30:31.080 --> 30:34.493
[man on TV] The 6th Street bridge
was shut down for several hours,

30:34.583 --> 30:37.541
in the wake of a ﬁery car accident
that left two injured.

30:37.628 --> 30:40.540
An unidentiﬁed 40-year-old woman
and her son.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.043
Fortunately for the two,
Dr. Jack Shephard

30:43.134 --> 30:46.752
was near the scene, pulled the victims
from the burning wreckage,

30:46.846 --> 30:50.009
and treated them at the scene
until paramedics arrived.

30:50.099 --> 30:53.432
The victims were later transported
to St. Sebastian Hospital.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.448
- I'm going back.
- What?

31:09.535 --> 31:13.278
- I'm going back to the beach.
- No way. We keep moving.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.033
I ain't asking permission.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.837
Look, you got a job to do here.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.791
I ain't gonna stand
in your way of you doing it.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.467
But you sure don't need me.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.717
What do you think you're gonna get done,
alone and unarmed?

31:31.807 --> 31:34.139
- He won't be alone. I'll go with him.
- No.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.726
Twenty minutes ago,
you weren't even going,

31:40.816 --> 31:42.477
and now you're telling Jack...

31:42.568 --> 31:44.479
I didn't want to go with you.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.571
Sawyer, it's a suicide mission
without guns.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.149
I know where there are some guns.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.781
There's a hidden cache
a couple miles from here.

31:54.872 --> 31:57.830
I can take us back
to the beach on a route past it.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.124
Juliet, you don't have to do that.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.054
Let's do this.

32:19.021 --> 32:22.434
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I won't if you won't.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.488
Don't wait up.

32:47.883 --> 32:52.502
[Charlie singing]

32:53.222 --> 32:54.837
I told you to shut up!

32:54.932 --> 32:57.389
You know when you get a tune
stuck in your head?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.432
This song just started coming to me.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.726
It's almost finished.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.725
- | just need to find the bridge.
- Get the spear gun.

33:03.858 --> 33:05.894
- What? Why?
- Because I want it to hurt.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.352
- No. Ben said we have to...
- You don't wanna get it? I will.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.065
Bonnie!

33:12.241 --> 33:15.153
Oi! Oi! l'll shut up! I'll shut up!
I'll shut up!

33:19.874 --> 33:21.159
Mikhail?

33:23.586 --> 33:26.077
I thought you two
were on assignment in Canada.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.628
He made us promise not to tell anyone.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.761
- Hello again.
- Where is the other one?

33:36.223 --> 33:39.010
- What?
- This idiot swam down from a boat.

33:39.101 --> 33:43.014
l was just shooting at his friend.
He dove down here.

33:43.105 --> 33:45.312
- He's alone.
- Are you sure about that?

33:46.775 --> 33:49.152
Here's a better question
to ask, Cyclops.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.693
Why did your little friend Ben
tell you people

33:51.780 --> 33:54.522
that this entire station was flooded
when it isn't?

33:54.617 --> 33:58.860
Or why these two have been jamming
transmissions off the island?

33:58.954 --> 34:02.287
What? Is that true?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.035
[beeping]

34:04.126 --> 34:05.787
- That's Ben.
- I'll get it.

34:05.878 --> 34:08.369
[beeping continues]

34:12.301 --> 34:15.668
You have to understand.
Everything I did, I did for the island.

34:15.763 --> 34:19.051
The island told you it was necessary
to jam your own people?

34:19.141 --> 34:22.508
Yes, it did.
You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail.

34:22.603 --> 34:27.017
Now I'm asking you to trust me,
to trust Jacob, who told me to do this.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.689
Why would Jacob
ask you to lie to your own people?

34:29.777 --> 34:31.768
Because this island is under assault

34:31.862 --> 34:35.605
by forces stronger than anything
it's had to deal with in many years.

34:35.699 --> 34:39.237
And we are meant to protect it,
Mikhail, by any means necessary.

34:39.328 --> 34:42.912
The jamming was for everyone's security.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.990
We are in a serious situation here.

34:48.212 --> 34:50.419
So why not trust me?

34:50.506 --> 34:52.838
I made a mistake.

34:52.925 --> 34:56.133
I should have told you and I apologize.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.922
Mikhail? Are you still there?

35:05.729 --> 35:06.809
Yes.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.270
I need you to help me.

35:13.362 --> 35:17.150
I need you to help me clean up
this mess that I've made.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.366
I need you to kill Charlie.

35:22.329 --> 35:26.368
Make sure that the jamming mechanism
continues to function at all costs.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.992
We can't risk Greta and Bonnie
telling the others what we've done.

35:30.087 --> 35:32.829
So you'll have
to take care of them too.

35:37.011 --> 35:40.048
How do I know you didn't say
the same thing to them about me?

35:40.139 --> 35:44.883
Because if I had, Mikhail,
you'd already be dead.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.751
You OK?

36:11.545 --> 36:14.252
Yeah. ljust got a rock in my shoe.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.926
He didn't mean it, you know.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.139
- What?
- Sawyer.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.769
When he said that he didn't want
you to come go him, he didn't mean it.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.397
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

36:37.988 --> 36:40.400
He was trying to protect you.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.735
That's why I asked you
not to come back for me.

36:51.293 --> 36:55.787
Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.667
He'd never do it for you.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.213
Because I love you.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.367
[Sawyer] When you pulled us out
of those polar bear cages

37:31.458 --> 37:33.414
and put us on the chain gang,

37:33.502 --> 37:36.164
what did you have us
breaking all those rocks for?

37:36.255 --> 37:39.338
- We were building a runway.
- A runway? For what?

37:40.300 --> 37:41.460
The aliens.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.928
I don't know what for.
Do you think they told me everything?

37:47.015 --> 37:49.006
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.224
- So you screwing Jack yet?
- No. Are you?

37:55.190 --> 37:57.055
[snickers]

37:57.151 --> 38:00.188
- How far away are these guns?
- There aren't any guns.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.896
- What?
- I lied.

38:03.991 --> 38:07.324
- You lied?
- It was the only way he'd let us go.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.748
So why are you going back?

38:16.378 --> 38:17.709
Karma.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.296
Why are you going back, James?

38:21.633 --> 38:23.464
Hey!

38:25.220 --> 38:27.211
Hey, guys! Wait up!

38:29.183 --> 38:31.970
- What the hell do you want?
- I'm coming with you guys.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.893
Uh-uh. No way, not a chance.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.689
Come on, I can help!
They're my friends too, man.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.395
Charlie wouldn't let me go with him.

38:41.487 --> 38:45.071
And Jack's too busy leading
to even talk to me.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.069
| just wanna help. Please?

38:50.662 --> 38:54.826
For God sakes, Hugo, look at you.
You're just gonna get in the way.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.667
You wanna get us killed?

39:01.965 --> 39:03.421
Come on.

39:18.065 --> 39:22.809
If we head north, we should get to them
before they reach the tower.

39:23.362 --> 39:24.852
Why did you let me come?

39:24.947 --> 39:28.405
I let you come because
I'm delivering you to your new family.

39:29.910 --> 39:33.198
I let you come
because you betrayed me, Alex.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.153
You locked Karl in a cage.

39:35.249 --> 39:37.786
You put him in a room
and tried to brainwash him.

39:38.794 --> 39:42.036
I didn't want him to get you pregnant.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.961
I suppose I overreacted.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.417
- We'd better get going.
- Ben...

39:49.471 --> 39:53.885
Why do you have to stop them?
Why won't you just let them leave?

39:56.812 --> 39:59.804
Because I can't, Alex.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.105
[groaning]

40:44.192 --> 40:46.808
[breathing heavy]

41:37.871 --> 41:39.987
[murmuring sound]

41:40.082 --> 41:41.913
[boy] Don't, John.

41:48.924 --> 41:50.130
Put the gun down.

41:54.304 --> 41:55.510
Walt.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.758
Now, get up, John.

42:00.435 --> 42:05.225

42:05.315 --> 42:09.024

42:10.404 --> 42:11.860
VVhy?

42:11.947 --> 42:14.859
Because you have work to do.
