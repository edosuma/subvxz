01:06.299 --> 01:08.735
Mr S just picked up
an alien energy trace.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.870
Just for a second,
and then it vanished.

01:10.937 --> 01:13.606
Somewhere in all of that.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.442
Right, and what is
all of that?

01:15.508 --> 01:17.844
Transmissions from radio,
TV, satellite.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.381
That's every signal,

on the planet.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.183
It's the sound of the Earth.

of alien energy is it?

01:36.463 --> 01:38.364

01:48.374 --> 01:50.243
So, the world gets blown
to smoky bits

01:50.310 --> 01:52.712
and we weren't there
to stop it because
it was a school night?

Mmm-hmm! Go on, home!

01:55.281 --> 01:57.083

Yeah, I can skim it.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.719

the back cover,
page 73, and the last chapter.

'cause you wanted to?

03:16.296 --> 03:17.163

disappeared the same way,

when everyone went,

11:34.627 --> 11:36.362

11:36.429 --> 11:38.664
also took all
the planes and cars,
all the moving vehicles.

What if there was a ray
or something beamed at Earth

and we weren't affected
but everyone else got blasted?

and the cars?

got to do a Sarah Jane.

think and work it out.

sat here doing?

about us?

different, I reckon it's her.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.639
Yeah.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.341

more than anyone else?

us anywhere.

he'll come down to us.

up in the quad thinking,

13:26.739 --> 13:28.741
"Maybe if I stay put,
they'll come up to me?"

13:28.807 --> 13:31.744
What if he's not there at all?

13:31.810 --> 13:34.813
What if it's just
the two of us left in
the whole wide world?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.817

13:39.451 --> 13:40.586

13:44.623 --> 13:45.858
There's got to be.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.697
All right. Where do we start?

13:51.764 --> 13:53.499
Back to the attic.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.234
If anything's going to happen,
it's going to happen there.

13:55.301 --> 13:56.735

happens again.

14:04.910 --> 14:05.844
Hello?

14:07.780 --> 14:09.548

a cat or something.

Come on!

14:27.566 --> 14:28.567
Where'd it go?

14:31.136 --> 14:33.138
There! Stop! Oi!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.143
-Come on!
-One second!

14:38.210 --> 14:39.278
But this is stealing!

14:39.345 --> 14:40.512
Yeah? We'll bring them back!

14:41.614 --> 14:43.148
Always wanted a go with that.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.084
Why do you get the cool bike?
This one's all sodding pink!

14:45.150 --> 14:46.185
Oh! Does it matter?

14:50.656 --> 14:51.890
We've got to find out
who it is!

14:54.660 --> 14:56.996
-There!
-It was a kid.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.564
He's gone. Hello?

15:00.099 --> 15:00.899
-Hello!
-Hey!

15:02.534 --> 15:03.402
Come on!

15:08.440 --> 15:09.475
Please stop.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.636
What do you want?
Get away from me.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.837
How did you get in here?

15:38.904 --> 15:40.472
Stay away!

We're not going to hurt you.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.510
We are so glad to see you.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.046
Sorry, yeah, I know,
girl in your bedroom.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.113
Where's everybody gone?

15:48.180 --> 15:49.481
Did you do this?

15:49.548 --> 15:50.816
-Why did you follow me?
-Let's all calm down.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.885
I'm Rani, this is Clyde.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.022
Gavin.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.524
I'll go make us
a cup of tea, yeah?

16:05.364 --> 16:07.900
I don't blame you, really,
being scared.

16:08.901 --> 16:09.902
I'm not scared.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.674
Your mum and dad.
They just disappeared?

16:15.741 --> 16:17.976
They're my aunt and uncle.
My mum died years ago.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.879
Never knew my dad,
he ran off when I was little.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.716
You and me both, mate.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.818
Lynne, my aunt,
she just vanished.

16:25.884 --> 16:28.554
I knocked on the doors.
There was nothing there,
so I went into town.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.588
It's exactly what we did.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.759
You got any better biscuits?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.027
How did you get in here?

16:35.094 --> 16:36.562
I locked the door.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.063
Long story.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.000
Can you keep a secret?

16:43.602 --> 16:44.570
Yeah.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.509
Whoa.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.513
Sonic lipstick.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.115
It's alien technology.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.416
You're aliens!

16:57.483 --> 16:58.817
-What?
-Rani!

16:58.884 --> 17:01.253
No! But we've met aliens,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.188
-fought aliens.
-Why are you telling him this?

17:03.255 --> 17:04.522
Remember rule number one?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.325
Gavin has got a right to know.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.761
Well, he needs to know,
if anything happens to us.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.496
Don't wind me up!

17:10.561 --> 17:13.165
It's true. Is it any weirder
than what happened today?

17:13.232 --> 17:15.666
Aliens took everybody?
That's impossible.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.536
-This is mad!
-RANI: But it's happened.

17:17.603 --> 17:18.670
And there's just
the three of us left,

17:18.737 --> 17:22.241
and we have got to
work out why.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.175
My aunt said there's
no such thing as aliens.

17:24.242 --> 17:25.911
Your aunt likes
rubbish biscuits.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.683
So, aliens. Have you ever
met any, seen any?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.019
What, me? No!
What are you talking about?

17:34.086 --> 17:36.455
There must be a reason why
there's only three of us left.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.392
Now you think I'm an alien?

17:40.459 --> 17:44.096
No, you're weird.
This is like some stupid
kids' game we're playing.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.465
I'm not stupid.
There are no aliens!

17:55.441 --> 17:56.542
What's this now?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.046
CLYDE: Is that like
a generator?

18:02.281 --> 18:03.816
RANI: Could be a signal.

18:03.882 --> 18:05.984
That trumpet noise,
getting our attention.

18:06.051 --> 18:09.688
Could be anything. It could be
a star drive powering down.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.424
That alien energy
source Mr Smith picked up!

18:12.491 --> 18:16.195
Yeah! No surrounding noise,
but it comes through clear.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.897
Gavin, have you ever
heard anything
like this before?

18:21.700 --> 18:22.701
Gavin?

18:25.003 --> 18:26.705
-Where's he gone?
-We're idiots!

18:26.772 --> 18:27.906
He must be terrified.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.577
The bike's gone!

(TRUMPETS BLARING)

18:33.612 --> 18:34.713
It's coming from
the High Street.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.482
Right, let's take a look!

18:36.548 --> 18:37.983
That's my bike!

18:38.050 --> 18:38.884
Does it matter?

18:51.363 --> 18:53.932
We've lost it
and we've lost Gavin.

18:54.132 --> 18:57.002
Weird alien noise,
terrified kid
and what do we do?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.705
Run to the window and
start talking all <i>Star Trek.</i>

18:59.771 --> 19:01.306
We must have looked
really normal.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.075
Is Gavin normal, though?

19:03.141 --> 19:04.042
What do you mean?

19:06.245 --> 19:08.380
Well, this morning,
when I was alone,

19:08.447 --> 19:10.582
I thought I was
the only one left,
it was horrible.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.750
If I'd seen anyone else,

19:11.817 --> 19:13.752
even if it was Chris Moyles,

19:13.819 --> 19:16.388
I would have run towards them,
not run away like Gavin did.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.190
-Wouldn't you?
-Yeah.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.258
But when you were that age,

19:19.324 --> 19:21.393
sixth form kids looked
big and scary.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.362
I'm not big and scary.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.197
And that flat,
apart from one photo,

19:25.264 --> 19:27.799
was there anything
that said a kid lives here?

19:27.866 --> 19:29.668
No kids' DVDs lying around.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.104
No photos of them with him.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.239
And his room,
it was like a cell.

19:34.306 --> 19:38.043
No computer games or anything.
Isn't that weird?

19:38.110 --> 19:41.079
Then we should feel
sorry for him,
not start judging him.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.714
He lives a really
rubbish life,

19:42.781 --> 19:43.782
and what's our first reaction?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.817
"Oh, maybe he's an alien."

19:45.884 --> 19:47.753
What are we?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.021
Are we sure he isn't?

19:49.221 --> 19:52.224
No! I don't know and
neither do you.
Just leave it.

19:52.291 --> 19:56.562
-Oh, so you're in charge?
-Yeah, I think I probably
should be.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.297

for longer than you.

you're second in command, sir?

a plan of action!

Never would have done that
before Sarah Jane.

-Hey!

20:43.609 --> 20:45.877
We are vital team members.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.146
What, the two kids with
no reason to be there?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.716
The hangers-on?

20:50.782 --> 20:53.785
We're both just really nosey.
That's how we got into
Sarah Jane's life.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.187
She warned us off,

20:55.253 --> 20:56.989
gave us the choice
to go back and forget it all.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.992
Maybe she was right.

21:00.058 --> 21:04.029
Maybe today's the day it all
comes back to bite us
on the bum.

21:04.096 --> 21:09.668
Do you think that if it wasn't
for Sarah Jane and our thing,
that we'd have been mates?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.672
I don't know. Maybe.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.774
Maybe not.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.076
It's not the usual way
to grow up, though, is it?

21:21.146 --> 21:23.915

of my old gang any more.

They're like, "I met this
hottie in Whispers in Acton."

21:26.852 --> 21:30.889
What am I supposed to say?
"I was fighting the Pied Piper
of Hamelin?"

21:32.591 --> 21:34.493
-I love it, though.
-Yeah.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.161
With Sarah Jane,
half the time I'm terrified

21:36.228 --> 21:38.497
and the other half,
I'm really happy.

21:40.298 --> 21:43.535
Well, I'm leaning towards
terrified right now.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.437
None of this makes sense.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.540
If they're clever enough,
if they're powerful enough
to magic...

Okay, teleport away,
everybody...

21:51.777 --> 21:53.478
Let's say it is.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.781
Let's say they've got rid of
everyone so they can invade,

21:55.847 --> 21:57.816
take over Earth
for themselves.

21:58.950 --> 21:59.885
Then where are they?

22:01.520 --> 22:02.754
And why haven't they
come to get us?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.189
Don't tempt fate.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.891
I'm not like Sarah Jane,
I believe in fate.

from up there somewhere.
