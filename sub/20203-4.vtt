00:05.639 --> 00:08.376
I am today announcing
my candidacy

00:08.376 --> 00:10.578
for the Presidency
of the United States.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.746
**

00:12.746 --> 00:15.416
The year was 1960.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.821
* You don't know baby
what I got on mind *

00:20.821 --> 00:23.924
* You can't quit me
that no need no time *

00:23.924 --> 00:25.559
* I'm wild about you baby... *

00:25.559 --> 00:27.561
America was locked
in a cold war.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.131
* I'm wild about you baby *

00:30.131 --> 00:31.632
In North Carolina,

00:31.632 --> 00:34.435
four African-American students
staged a sit-in

00:34.435 --> 00:36.970
at a "whites only"
lunch counter.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.372
* Whoo *

00:38.372 --> 00:39.740
And the FDA had just approved

00:39.740 --> 00:41.075
a new form
of birth control...

00:41.075 --> 00:42.743
* Whoo-hoo *

00:42.743 --> 00:46.114
...that would soon be known
simply as "the pill."

00:48.082 --> 00:51.552
It seemed like the dawn
of a new era.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.357
* Seeing things... *

00:56.357 --> 01:00.361
And for me,
life was definitely changing.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.729
* Whoo *

01:01.729 --> 01:03.464
I was newly divorced...

01:03.464 --> 01:07.368
with a brand-new mansion
in Chicago.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.170
And for the first time,

01:09.170 --> 01:13.574
I was publicly embracing
the Playboy lifestyle.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.714
With all the distraction
at my new home,

01:20.714 --> 01:23.551
I was starting
to fall behind on my work.

01:25.719 --> 01:29.190
So I brought on
a personal assistant.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.592
Her name
was Bobbie Arnstein.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.496
Rise and shine.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.233
I let you sleep
till 3:00.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.536
You need a taxi, honey?
I'll call you one.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.338
Come on.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.106
You got an editorial
meeting in an hour.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.575
Spec and Russell
are waiting.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.344
Wake me in 45.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.484
Bobbie Arnstein started
as a secretary

01:56.484 --> 01:59.153
for the company
right out of high school.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.822
She was incredibly bright.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.492
She had a marvelous
sense of humor.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.663
Hefner looked to her
for personal advice

02:09.663 --> 02:12.400
and even business advice
at some time.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.368
And she did not
hesitate to give it.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.738
Do yourself a favor
and take a shower.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.073
You need one.

02:20.073 --> 02:23.411
She had a sensitivity
and a humor

02:23.411 --> 02:26.247
and an intellect that I have
never found probably

02:26.247 --> 02:28.849
in any other woman
in my life.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.884
She was a pal.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.587
She was a confidant.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.924
And she was, yeah,
my right hand... arm.

02:36.924 --> 02:41.028
Bobbie was an instant fit
in the Playboy family,

02:41.028 --> 02:43.364
handling my life
and responsibilities

02:43.364 --> 02:45.533
within the magazine
with ease.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.238
People were not used
to really bright women.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.172
It was okay for a woman
to try to succeed.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.709
It wasn't okay for a woman
to be faster than you are,

02:55.709 --> 02:58.779
smarter than you are,
and Bobbie was.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.816
With Bobbie managing my life,

03:02.816 --> 03:05.719
I rarely had to leave
the mansion.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.188
I brought the staff in
for meetings,

03:08.188 --> 03:12.426
and the line between work
and play began to blur.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.829
**

03:15.829 --> 03:17.565
* Yeah... *

03:17.565 --> 03:18.899
* Yeah... *

03:20.868 --> 03:22.870
* It's got to be mellow... *

03:22.870 --> 03:24.272
- Ray.
- Hef.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.573
Good to see you, my friend.
How are you?

03:25.573 --> 03:26.540
Very well.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.875
* It's got to be mellow *

03:27.875 --> 03:29.410
The parties were growing.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.612
* 'Cause my baby loves me... *

03:31.612 --> 03:33.514
And between
the dance floor...

03:33.514 --> 03:35.148
* And I'm her only fella *

03:35.148 --> 03:39.853
...the pool, the cocktails,
and the women,

03:39.853 --> 03:42.823
the mansion quickly
became the place to be.

03:46.193 --> 03:49.297
On any given night,
the guest list included stars

03:49.297 --> 03:50.464
like Tony Curtis,

03:50.464 --> 03:52.366
Frank Sinatra,

03:52.366 --> 03:53.467
Woody Allen,

03:53.467 --> 03:54.902
Joe DiMaggio,

03:54.902 --> 03:56.270
Phyllis Diller,

03:56.270 --> 03:58.672
and Sammy Davis Jr.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.774
Everything I had heard
about the place was true,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.175
it was exotic.

04:02.175 --> 04:06.947
Many young women excite
anyone's amorous propensities.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.385
People were lining up
outside the mansion

04:11.385 --> 04:13.854
just hoping to get
a glimpse inside.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.391
With everyone wanting in,

04:17.391 --> 04:19.159
I realized
there might be a way

04:19.159 --> 04:21.562
to let the public
experience my world.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.896
* Ooh... *

04:24.332 --> 04:25.699
* Yeah *

04:25.699 --> 04:28.268
And in that moment,
I came up with

04:28.268 --> 04:32.340
what would become our most
ambitious undertaking yet.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.879
* Every little movement *

04:38.879 --> 04:43.183
* Every little thing
you do *

04:43.183 --> 04:45.853
* Is it sleight of hand *

04:45.853 --> 04:50.691
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

04:50.691 --> 04:54.928
* Every little movement *

04:54.928 --> 04:57.998
* Every
little movement **

05:01.369 --> 05:03.437
**

05:08.842 --> 05:10.878
* Monday's so good... *

05:12.145 --> 05:14.615
In the spring of 1960,

05:14.615 --> 05:18.386
I started dating a girl
named Cynthia Maddox.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.088
* Monday is so happy now... *

05:21.088 --> 05:24.892
Hi, I'm Cynthia Maddox
and I work for the magazine.

05:24.892 --> 05:28.829
* So you take it
while you find it... *

05:28.829 --> 05:32.032
Cynthia and I met
at the Playboy offices.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.636
She'd recently been promoted
to assistant cartoon editor

05:35.636 --> 05:38.906
after working her way up
from receptionist.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.541
Hi, Cynthia.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.044
Cynthia was brought in
by Bobbie Arnstein.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.814
They were friends
in high school.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.418
She was bright and charming
and beautiful

05:50.418 --> 05:55.088
and demonstrated
editorial intelligence.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.324
- It's ready.
- Oh, excellent.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.827
- And this is ready, too.
- Yes.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.162
With her new position,

06:02.162 --> 06:06.467
Cynthia and I began spending
more time together.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.505
Cynthia Maddox was a great girl.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.641
You know, very outgoing.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.643
And she became
Hef's girlfriend,

06:15.643 --> 06:17.778
uh, live-in girlfriend.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.781
And she traveled
a lot with him.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.951
* Friday you'll beg her... *

06:23.951 --> 06:26.487
She would be seen in public

06:26.487 --> 06:29.089
with Hef at all major events.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.826
* One day she'll say
she'll love you... *

06:32.826 --> 06:37.865
It was my first real
relationship since my divorce.

06:37.865 --> 06:41.435
But as happy as I was
with Cynthia,

06:41.435 --> 06:44.838
I wasn't quite ready to give up
the bachelor lifestyle.

06:46.940 --> 06:52.880
* It ain't nothin' but love
it ain't nothin' but love *

06:52.880 --> 06:55.883
* Can you feel your heart
skip a little beat... *

06:55.883 --> 06:58.652
I vowed after my divorce...

06:58.652 --> 07:01.021
never to marry again.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.825
* It ain't nothin' but love *

07:04.825 --> 07:08.195
Hef was always very upfront
with his girlfriends

07:08.195 --> 07:13.501
that he was not interested in a
monogamous relationship at all,

07:13.501 --> 07:15.202
even though they were
living together.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.405
* You feel your head
spinnin' all around... *

07:18.405 --> 07:21.208
No matter how involved
I became

07:21.208 --> 07:24.512
in a primary romantic
relationship,

07:24.512 --> 07:27.114
there were still
other secondary affairs.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.850
I guess I wanted,
as a young man

07:29.850 --> 07:33.053
to have somehow
the best of both worlds.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.788
* It ain't nothin' but love *

07:34.788 --> 07:37.324
* It ain't nothin'
but love **

07:37.324 --> 07:38.926
We're probably gonna have
a couple of hundred

07:38.926 --> 07:41.461
people here, uh,
throughout the night.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.297
It's, uh, a party of this kind
usually begins for us

07:44.297 --> 07:48.669
around 1:00 and, uh,
and goes till dawn.

07:48.669 --> 07:53.106
* Beautiful beautiful
brown eyes *

07:53.106 --> 07:58.411
* Oh I said beautiful
beautiful brown eyes... *

07:58.411 --> 08:02.149
The truth was, I was having
the time of my life.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.085
Our mansion parties
had become legendary.

08:05.085 --> 08:10.190
* I'll never love
blue eyes again *

08:10.190 --> 08:13.661
**

08:13.661 --> 08:15.729
Now, I wanted to give
my readers

08:15.729 --> 08:19.399
a chance to experience them
firsthand.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.903
And I'd finally come up
with a way to do it.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.772
**

08:31.111 --> 08:33.280
The inspiration came
from a feature

08:33.280 --> 08:34.948
we'd run years earlier.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.353
A November 1956 article

08:40.353 --> 08:44.558
profiling a new, private
nightspot in Chicago,

08:44.558 --> 08:47.695
the Gaslight Club.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.698
Modeled after a
turn-of-the-century speakeasy,

08:50.698 --> 08:53.133
with its exclusive
membership policy

08:53.133 --> 08:55.969
and scantily clad waitresses,

08:55.969 --> 08:59.472
it quickly caught
the attention of our readers.

08:59.472 --> 09:04.044
It was a private club,
and the girls were uniformed

09:04.044 --> 09:07.848
in a sort of
18th-century outfit.

09:07.848 --> 09:12.019
And we had over 1,200 letters
from readers

09:12.019 --> 09:14.988
asking how they could join
the Gaslight Club.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.028
I knew we could do the concept
of the Gaslight Club,

09:21.028 --> 09:24.932
but make it bigger, better,
and more accessible.

09:26.667 --> 09:31.038
And that's when I decided
to open the Playboy Club.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.345
The pages of the magazine
come to life.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.248
Victor Lownes and I
immediately got to work,

09:41.248 --> 09:42.249
formulating a plan.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.685
The Bunny logo...
right there.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.722
Connecting to Playboy,

09:48.722 --> 09:50.323
coming to a Playboy party

09:50.323 --> 09:55.595
was the ultimate goal
of so many people.

09:55.595 --> 10:00.367
And the clubs were meant
to bring to life

10:00.367 --> 10:02.502
the lifestyle of the magazine.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.637
There's a market
for this.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.309
The vision that my dad had
for the clubs were to act

10:09.309 --> 10:12.345
as a sort of opportunity
for readers of the magazine

10:12.345 --> 10:17.651
or watchers of the show to be
able to go and live out

10:17.651 --> 10:20.320
whatever they were
reading or watching.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.925
**

10:29.229 --> 10:31.098
If we were going
to do this right,

10:31.098 --> 10:34.467
we knew we needed a partner.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.370
* There ain't nothin'
I can't do... *

10:37.370 --> 10:38.839
How are you?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.774
Back then,
our favorite club in Chicago

10:40.774 --> 10:42.810
was the Walton Walk,

10:42.810 --> 10:45.512
owned by Arnold Morton.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.715
Arnie!
Good to see you.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.549
- Victor, always a pleasure.
- Arnie...

10:49.549 --> 10:51.852
I had a friend, Arnie Morton.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.954
And we knew that he knew
something about

10:53.954 --> 10:56.056
the business end of it,
'cause we knew nothing

10:56.056 --> 10:58.892
about running a restaurant
or nightclub.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.894
Can I get you guys
a round of drinks?

11:00.894 --> 11:02.462
Arnie Morton was well-known

11:02.462 --> 11:05.098
as a restaurateur
even in those days.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.268
Of course, he became gigantic
as the years went on

11:08.268 --> 11:12.806
with his own Morton's operations
in half the cities in America.

11:12.806 --> 11:13.974
Hope to see you again.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.208
Good to see you, John.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.177
I knew the only way

11:17.177 --> 11:18.879
to bring our vision to life

11:18.879 --> 11:21.114
was to make Arnie
part of the team.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.387
Well, first of all,
we need a location.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.025
We teamed up,
we each took a piece of it.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.762
Hefner had a piece,
the magazine had a piece.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.463
Arnie had a piece
and I had a piece.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.431
There were four owners.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.533
I know of a premises that
isn't being used down there

11:40.533 --> 11:43.603
at the moment and I think
I can make a couple of calls.

11:43.603 --> 11:47.274
Our first order of business was
to secure the perfect location.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.341
Gentlemen...

11:50.643 --> 11:51.979
To the Playboy Club.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.781
The Playboy Club.

11:53.781 --> 11:58.085
And Arnie said there was only
one place our club could be.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.354
Chicago's Gold Coast district.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.957
**

12:11.999 --> 12:16.236
Once known
for its mob-controlled
speakeasies and casinos,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.138
it was now home
to the hottest clubs

12:18.138 --> 12:20.440
and restaurantsChicago
had to offer.

12:22.109 --> 12:26.513
Nightclubs were a new,
a new glamour,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.248
uh, for manhood.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.054
Everybody had
their nightclub.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.056
There were local nightclubs.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.825
There were
black nightclubs.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.159
There were Jewish nightclubs,

12:39.159 --> 12:41.394
Italian night...
in the neighborhood.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.931
But the big hit was
to come downtown.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.903
And Arnie knew of a place
that was available...

12:49.903 --> 12:53.106
116 East Walton.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.943
The former home
of the Cameo Club.

12:55.943 --> 13:01.181
Five stories high and right
in the heart of the action.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.650
We planned to transform
the Cameo Club

13:03.650 --> 13:06.186
into a fantasy bachelor pad

13:06.186 --> 13:08.455
with rooms designed to look
like a living room

13:08.455 --> 13:09.857
and a library,

13:09.857 --> 13:13.193
as well as a disco
and a theater.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.398
With construction under way,

13:18.398 --> 13:22.169
we began focusing on the club's
most important feature.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.410
So, Hef, we need to deal with
the issue of the waitresses.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.146
Right, right,
the, uh, the Playmates.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.082
What's your preference?

13:35.082 --> 13:39.319
Hefner wanted to call
the waitresses Playmates.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.890
And he wanted to dress them
in shorty nightgowns.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.893
And somehow
that was gonna be very sexy.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.228
But, uh, we kept seeing
that there were gonna be

13:48.228 --> 13:51.965
a lot of problems in
overexposure, et cetera,

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
if we dress the girls
in nightgowns.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.836
I would like to suggest
going in a different direction.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.173
Rather than the Playmate,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.175
what do you think
about Bunnies?

14:02.175 --> 14:05.245
- Bunnies?
- Mmm.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.518
We tried to persuade him
to use the Playboy rabbit,

14:11.518 --> 14:15.255
which was always a male rabbit
in a little dinner jacket.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.390
But we tried to persuade him
that this could be

14:17.390 --> 14:20.560
applied to the girls,
and he was sold.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.898
Victor spent weeks working
on the costume.

14:24.898 --> 14:28.235
And after many iterations,

14:28.235 --> 14:31.371
he finally revealed
the prototype

14:31.371 --> 14:34.908
on our television show
Playboy's Penthouse

14:34.908 --> 14:39.746
using the perfect model,
my girlfriend, Cynthia Maddox.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.647
Hey, Hef...

14:41.915 --> 14:44.217
Hef, uh, I hate
to interrupt you

14:44.217 --> 14:46.219
with business
at this time of night.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.321
But I've got something
I want you to see.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.090
The, uh, little Bunny outfit

14:50.090 --> 14:51.791
for the girls
at the Playboy Club.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.194
- This is the outfit.
- Yeah.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.895
That's what
we cooked up.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.065
Well, I like that
very much, uh...

14:58.065 --> 14:59.899
Including the,
the outfit, too.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.402
Oh, yeah,
it'll work out.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.470
Uh...

15:03.470 --> 15:05.005
Do you think our members
will like that?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.473
I think the members
will like that.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.942
Maybe I ought to explain
that, uh, Playboy is,

15:08.942 --> 15:12.012
is, uh, going in
the Key Club business.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.982
Starting as of
the 1st of the year,

15:14.982 --> 15:16.583
there will be keys
very much like this

15:16.583 --> 15:19.319
in the hands of members
throughout the country.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.457
Our viewers gave the costume
rave reviews.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.294
But I still felt
something was missing.

15:27.294 --> 15:33.233
The Bunny costume wasn't quite
the way Hefner envisioned it.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.469
So he added some important
elements to the costume.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.371
We don't want this
to be too drastic.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.741
If we cut this collar,
just a clean cut.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.710
And the cuffs as well.

15:43.710 --> 15:48.515
Hefner can be difficult
because he's a perfectionist.

15:48.515 --> 15:53.320
Whether it's on the page
or whether it is a costume.

15:55.955 --> 16:00.660
I'd like to introduce you
to Cynthia Maddox,

16:00.660 --> 16:03.596
your first Playboy Bunny.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.043
Hefner was really instrumental

16:16.043 --> 16:18.478
in the changes
in the Bunny costume.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.880
I just raised the cut
to accentuate her legs.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.649
Lowered it a little
on the bust.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.285
He was the one
who insisted on the cuffs

16:25.285 --> 16:29.089
with the Playboy cufflink
and the bow tie.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.595
Would you mind doing
a spin for us, Cynthia?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.864
I think the costumes
are adorable.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.433
Fixed the tail.
Sits nicely there.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.001
There's just something,
the dichotomy

16:42.001 --> 16:45.405
of an innocent Bunny,
and then it's, you know, sexy,

16:45.405 --> 16:49.409
but it's still, again,
I think very classy.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.679
Hefner has a tremendous
visual eye.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.514
And as a result of that,

16:54.514 --> 16:58.485
our costume is in
the Smithsonian Institute

16:58.485 --> 17:03.623
and is the first costume that
ever received a copyright.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.226
Perfect.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.096
Now came the hard part.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.432
Finding 30 girls who could fill
that costume like Cynthia.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.671
So we put ads about
our upcoming auditions

17:18.671 --> 17:20.673
in newspapers around
the country.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.445
I was in college,
part-time job.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.215
Worked at a pharmacy.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.751
And the pharmacist got
something in the mail

17:31.751 --> 17:35.255
that said that they were
having a Bunny hunt.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.325
* Don't you know? *

17:38.325 --> 17:40.560
* Don't you know
I love you so? *

17:40.560 --> 17:42.862
**

17:42.862 --> 17:44.697
* Tell me why did
you leave me... *

17:44.697 --> 17:46.866
It said you'd make a good salary

17:46.866 --> 17:48.801
and you'd have fun.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.870
And you got to wear
this Bunny outfit.

17:50.870 --> 17:55.074
And it was the 1960s where it
was perfectly acceptable

17:55.074 --> 18:00.580
to tell these girls to bring
a bathing suit to audition in.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.815
Nowadays, they'd be up
on all kinds of charges.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.852
But back then,
it was perfectly acceptable.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.021
**

18:09.021 --> 18:12.091
Maybe I could go
and be a receptionist

18:12.091 --> 18:16.363
or work in a department store
and move my way up.

18:16.363 --> 18:20.267
But this was
an opportunity for me

18:20.267 --> 18:22.135
to make a very good living.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.539
So I went.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.980
The day of the first
Bunny auditions

18:33.980 --> 18:38.017
was one of the coldest days
I can remember.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.321
We weren't even sure
if anyone was going to show up.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.191
So, do we know
what kind of questions

18:44.191 --> 18:45.692
we're gonna be
asking these girls?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.894
Well, I think, uh,
keep it simple, um...

18:47.894 --> 18:49.496
Arnie's started
on a few here.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.531
I put Bobbie in charge
of running the auditions.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.733
Finally.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.603
You try wrangling 400 girls
without running behind.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.206
400?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.740
You ready?

19:02.175 --> 19:03.710
Absolutely.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.214
Quite ready.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.583
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.884
Uh, please take your mark.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.124
* Oh tell me Mama... *

19:18.124 --> 19:19.326
Thanks, Hayley,
and where are you from?

19:19.326 --> 19:20.793
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.094
Hello.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.631
Women came from
all across the country...

19:24.631 --> 19:26.966
- Where are you from?
- Seattle, Washington.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.035
- Massachusetts.
- Milwaukee.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.670
...and from every
walk of life...

19:30.670 --> 19:32.305
I'm a teller
at First Chicago.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.806
I'm a nurse.

19:33.806 --> 19:34.941
Real estate agent.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.243
I'm a sophomore
from DePaul.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.611
Great school.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.881
...looking for excitement,
adventure,

19:41.881 --> 19:44.183
and a taste
of the Playboy lifestyle.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.754
It was about youth.

19:47.754 --> 19:51.057
The advert said,
"Be a Playboy Bunny."

19:51.057 --> 19:55.061
And you had to be between
18 and 22 years of age.

19:55.061 --> 19:59.332
And so, naturally,
it was about young people,

19:59.332 --> 20:03.603
the spirit and whatever
went with that.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.104
All right,
thank you very much.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.573
All right, good-bye.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.679
Okay, so... that's it,
that's the last one.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.847
- That's it?
- Yeah.

20:14.847 --> 20:15.748
What do you do?

20:15.748 --> 20:18.184
I'm an assistant
to you assholes.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.188
Uh, uh, ma'am,
uh, where's your swimsuit?

20:22.188 --> 20:23.290
Go fuck yourselves, okay?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.491
You're hired!

20:28.628 --> 20:30.263
Ahh...

20:30.263 --> 20:32.699
- Carol.
- No.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.535
No, not Carol.
Carol's in my top five.

20:35.535 --> 20:39.138
We spent hours deliberating
over the candidates.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.442
Of course, the Bunnies had
to be skilled waitresses,

20:42.442 --> 20:44.744
but they also had to be
much more.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.581
They were performers,
bringing to life

20:48.581 --> 20:50.350
the pages of the magazine.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.022
How's it going?

20:56.022 --> 20:57.757
- Hm...
- Not well.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.225
We only have 17.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.993
How about using
some Playmates?

21:00.993 --> 21:03.830
No.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.665
Why not?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.234
They're not gonna wanna
serve drinks for eight hours.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.636
I was just talking
to Joyce,

21:09.636 --> 21:11.338
and she said she thought
about auditioning

21:11.338 --> 21:13.340
- but she was sick.
- Joyce Nizzari?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
Joyce would look amazing
in one of those outfits.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.676
Uh-huh.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.245
Do you think any of the other
girls might consider it?

21:19.245 --> 21:21.748
I'll make some calls.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.082
Okay.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.150
Thanks, Bobbie.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.319
Anytime!

21:26.319 --> 21:29.188
**

21:29.188 --> 21:33.626
Bobbie was able to get five
of our Playmates to sign on,

21:33.626 --> 21:35.628
including Joyce Nizzari,

21:35.628 --> 21:38.765
December 1958's
Playmate of the Month.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.600
To our loyal readers,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.035
our Playmates were as famous
as any celebrity.

21:43.035 --> 21:46.906
And the chance to meet them
would be a dream come true.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.743
When the club opened in Chicago,
it was a knockout.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.645
We opened the door,
and the door Bunny

21:52.645 --> 21:54.681
was one of
the original Playmates.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.384
That's the stuff
of a fantasy land.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.053
Finally, we had our Bunnies.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.256
Let's give it a try,
go along this way, okay?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.292
Way we go, low, carry
at the moment, low carry.

22:06.292 --> 22:09.195
But if these Bunnies were
going to represent our clubs,

22:09.195 --> 22:12.632
we needed to make sure
nothing was left to chance.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.768
So I asked my brother Keith
to join the team.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.637
Faster, faster, faster,
high carry.

22:17.637 --> 22:21.007
Reverse!

22:22.709 --> 22:25.545
Keith had studied
at the Lee Strasberg studio,

22:25.545 --> 22:27.780
trying to make it as an actor.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.282
But when his career
failed to take off,

22:30.282 --> 22:32.819
he jumped
at the opportunity to help.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.122
I'd had a background
in teaching.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.657
I had a background
in show business,

22:37.657 --> 22:39.025
and I tried to bring
both of those things

22:39.025 --> 22:40.793
to bear in the clubs.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.830
So the first people that
I trained were the Bunnies.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.832
Good evening,
I'm your Bunny, Izzy.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.400
You notice that
she smiles,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.068
gives eye contact
with all four of us.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.904
We imagine that there's another
gentleman sitting there.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.473
**

22:58.010 --> 23:00.112
Along with Victor Lownes,

23:00.112 --> 23:02.314
Keith created what
would come to be known

23:02.314 --> 23:05.718
as the Bunny Manual.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.754
This is a Bunny Manual

23:07.754 --> 23:10.423
that we give to all the girls
when they start working.

23:10.423 --> 23:13.025
That gives you all
the rules and regulations

23:13.025 --> 23:17.096
that pertain to being
a Bunny in the Playboy Club.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.332
You will find that
we are very, very strict.

23:20.332 --> 23:23.770
In order to maintain
the right image for the club,

23:23.770 --> 23:27.406
we needed our Bunnies to follow
very specific rules.

23:27.406 --> 23:32.178
We wanted them to be glamorous,
but also highly professional.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.281
Bunnies were only allowed
to use their first names.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.950
They could not be seen
drinking any beverage

23:37.950 --> 23:40.987
or wearing any jewelry
during their shift.

23:40.987 --> 23:45.858
And each Bunny had to make sure
her grooming was impeccable.

23:45.858 --> 23:49.128
They knew the ingredients
of 125 different drinks

23:49.128 --> 23:51.464
and always had
their service trays

23:51.464 --> 23:54.166
arranged in a precise order.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.537
Our Bunnies went through
rigorous training,

23:57.537 --> 23:59.338
led by the Bunny Mothers

23:59.338 --> 24:03.610
who made sure each Bunny met
the manual's requirements.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.778
**

24:05.778 --> 24:07.947
Honey, why do you have this
costume on today, dear?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.816
My other costume's
in the cleaners.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.851
Mm-hmm, you'll have
to go downstairs

24:11.851 --> 24:13.285
and find
something else.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.621
Your shoes are
soiled, too.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.288
I'd like to have
you change clothes.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.592
Your ears are always bent
a little too much, Terri, why?

24:19.592 --> 24:22.228
I didn't know any
particular way to fix them.

24:22.228 --> 24:26.132
We had training
about four hours a day

24:26.132 --> 24:27.466
for six weeks.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.269
You started off with the tray.

24:30.269 --> 24:34.073
You spread your fingertips and
therefore you have full balance.

24:34.073 --> 24:37.376
Okay, now who's gonna try
a real high carry, okay?

24:37.376 --> 24:39.211
Whoop, there we go, no!

24:40.479 --> 24:41.881
It was intense.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.783
Do you notice
that she is doing

24:43.783 --> 24:45.017
what we call
a Bunny dip?

24:46.586 --> 24:49.021
To enforce the polished
image of our Bunnies,

24:49.021 --> 24:52.391
there were specific movements
each girl had to execute

24:52.391 --> 24:56.162
with the utmost precision
while serving our patrons.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.632
There was the Bunny stance,
how a Bunny should stand.

24:59.632 --> 25:03.803
Look, leg should be
against that table.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.337
Straight, all right?

25:05.337 --> 25:10.109
The Bunny perch,
how a Bunny should sit.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.811
Now dip.

25:11.811 --> 25:16.048
And most famously,
the Bunny dip.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.450
There you notice that
she's bending at the waist.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.553
That's incorrect.

25:20.553 --> 25:21.888
Another way that
it could be incorrect

25:21.888 --> 25:24.624
is if she were to go down
in a sitting position.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.660
Look, when you're
doing your dip, bend.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.596
This side should
never be broken.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.931
Let's see the Bunny dip
done just so.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.001
That's absolutely correct.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.908
With the Bunnies in training,

25:41.908 --> 25:43.843
the rest of the staff was
working overtime

25:43.843 --> 25:46.613
to get the club open
by the end of February.

25:50.549 --> 25:56.222
While Arnie was supervising
renovations...

25:56.222 --> 25:58.524
Victor was working hard
to sell memberships

25:58.524 --> 25:59.992
to the most affluent

25:59.992 --> 26:02.662
and most important men
around the country.

26:02.662 --> 26:06.132
The buzz around the club
had been building for months,

26:06.132 --> 26:09.135
but for all the people excited
about our opening

26:09.135 --> 26:12.338
there were just as many
who hoped we would fail.

26:14.674 --> 26:18.344
Everything about the extravagant
Playboy empire accents youth,

26:18.344 --> 26:21.547
glamour, money, and pleasure.

26:21.547 --> 26:25.885
Is Hugh Hefner's empire
a 20th-century Garden of Eden,

26:25.885 --> 26:28.621
or it is a modern-day
Sodom and Gomorrah?

26:28.621 --> 26:32.291
**

26:32.291 --> 26:37.329
Many still saw Playboy as just
another smutty magazine,

26:37.329 --> 26:41.033
and our famous parties
as just another example

26:41.033 --> 26:42.434
of the kind of debauchery

26:42.434 --> 26:44.737
people could expect
at our clubs.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.243
Hef always had the eyes
of the Catholic Church

26:51.243 --> 26:53.045
and the city government

26:53.045 --> 26:56.015
looking for any excuse
to close them down.

26:56.015 --> 26:59.819
Because every city thought it
would destroy the neighborhood.

27:01.587 --> 27:04.623
But I was determined
to prove them wrong.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.198
**

27:15.768 --> 27:17.970
When opening night
finally arrived,

27:17.970 --> 27:20.940
all of our hard work
was put to the test.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.578
The club looked great.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.716
The Bunnies looked even better.

27:29.716 --> 27:33.419
And we were ready to share
our vision with the world.

27:33.419 --> 27:37.757
All right, ladies,
let's hit the floor.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.258
Open the doors.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.127
**

27:53.105 --> 27:54.974
The opening of the Chicago club

27:54.974 --> 27:58.444
was something
truly exceptional.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.149
There was a line
around the block.

28:05.584 --> 28:09.321
You had to be a key holder
in order to get into the club.

28:12.191 --> 28:16.362
As you entered the club,
there was a board

28:16.362 --> 28:20.666
with the name plates
of all the club members

28:20.666 --> 28:25.004
so that when they checked in,
their name went up.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.439
And you could see who was
in the club that night.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.912
Every detail of the club
had been carefully thought out

28:32.912 --> 28:36.615
with something exciting
and new in every room.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.117
Across from the lobby

28:38.117 --> 28:40.920
was our full-service bar
and pool room

28:40.920 --> 28:45.925
where you could go one-on-one
with our Bumper Pool Bunny.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.327
The bar was called
the Playmate Bar.

28:48.327 --> 28:53.499
And we had transparencies of
all the Playmates on display.

28:56.936 --> 29:00.206
Upstairs in the "living room"
was the piano bar

29:00.206 --> 29:02.909
where we served up
our world-class buffet,

29:02.909 --> 29:04.811
all set to live music.

29:04.811 --> 29:08.714
And on the top floor,
we called that "the library,"

29:08.714 --> 29:10.950
our marquee performance venue.

29:14.053 --> 29:18.090
Now you can walk
into this experience.

29:18.090 --> 29:22.428
And for most people,
it was a fantasy.

29:22.428 --> 29:27.066
You know, you weren't gonna get
this at your neighborhood diner.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.635
You weren't gonna get
that anyplace

29:29.635 --> 29:31.770
but at the Playboy Club.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.240
**

29:36.608 --> 29:39.511
But the stars of the evening
were the Bunnies.

29:48.687 --> 29:53.292
We had desk Bunnies
to greet guests at the door

29:53.292 --> 29:57.029
as well
as coat check Bunnies...

29:57.029 --> 29:59.932
cigarette Bunnies...

29:59.932 --> 30:01.333
roaming camera Bunnies

30:01.333 --> 30:04.370
to capture
every special evening...

30:04.370 --> 30:08.607
gift shop Bunnies selling
Playboy merchandise...

30:08.607 --> 30:11.643
and our floor Bunnies
serving up drinks

30:11.643 --> 30:13.045
from the Playmate Bar.

30:39.205 --> 30:42.008
* I was born *

30:42.008 --> 30:44.410
* In a dump *

30:44.410 --> 30:49.949
* My mama died
and my daddy got drunk *

30:49.949 --> 30:52.718
* He left me here *

30:52.718 --> 30:55.354
* To die or grow *

30:55.354 --> 31:02.428
* In the middle
of Tobacco Road *

31:02.428 --> 31:06.232
* 'Cause it's my home yeah *

31:06.232 --> 31:10.069
* Yes it is
it's the only life *

31:10.069 --> 31:11.203
* That I have ever known... *

31:11.203 --> 31:13.039
- Victor.
- Hef.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.273
Good to see you.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.476
Welcome to the Playboy Club.
Look around.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.646
* Lord have mercy
but I love you *

31:20.646 --> 31:23.215
* I love you
because you're my home *

31:23.215 --> 31:26.685
* I'm talking
about Tobacco Road *

31:26.685 --> 31:27.786
Hello, gentlemen.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.155
* Tobacco Road... *

31:29.155 --> 31:30.957
When Cynthia and I showed up,

31:30.957 --> 31:33.092
the party was in full swing.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.360
* Tobacco Road *

31:35.561 --> 31:37.329
* I'll get some dynamite... *

31:37.329 --> 31:39.431
With every detail in place

31:39.431 --> 31:41.533
and the Bunnies looking
fantastic...

31:41.533 --> 31:43.735
* I'll blow it up
tear it down... *

31:43.735 --> 31:46.405
...all that was left to do
was enjoy the show.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.408
* On that road... *

31:49.408 --> 31:52.878
Just seven years
after launching Playboy

31:52.878 --> 31:54.213
from my kitchen table,

31:54.213 --> 31:56.382
there I was,
hosting what felt like

31:56.382 --> 31:58.517
the biggest party
on the planet.

31:58.517 --> 32:02.921
* I said I love you
because you are my home *

32:02.921 --> 32:05.924
* But you're dirty and filthy *

32:05.924 --> 32:09.261
* Tobacco Road *

32:09.261 --> 32:11.930
* On Tobacco Road *

32:11.930 --> 32:17.036
* I said I love you
because you are my home *

32:17.036 --> 32:20.306
* But you're dirty and filthy *

32:20.306 --> 32:23.109
* Tobacco Road *

32:23.109 --> 32:30.882
* Tobacco Road
Road Road... *

32:30.882 --> 32:32.384
* Hey! **

32:32.384 --> 32:34.120
**

32:34.120 --> 32:38.790
The opening in Chicago was one
of the best moments of my life.

32:40.426 --> 32:43.829
Thank you, thank you,
thank you much.

32:43.829 --> 32:47.866
The American male has found
a new place of relaxation.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.535
It's the Key Club.

32:49.535 --> 32:53.839
The most famous example of such
a type club is The Playboy.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.642
**

33:00.012 --> 33:02.014
Over the next few weeks,

33:02.014 --> 33:03.249
the crowds only grew.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.056
And the Bunnies weren't
the only attraction.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.531
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

33:19.531 --> 33:23.335
I'm really pleased
to introduce our next act.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.471
So, please give a warm
Playboy Club welcome

33:25.471 --> 33:28.207
to an incredible talent
from just up the road

33:28.207 --> 33:31.210
in Detroit, Michigan,
Miss Aretha Franklin.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.584
You'll do great.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.187
**

33:41.187 --> 33:42.388
With our TV show,

33:42.388 --> 33:44.556
we'd fought against segregation

33:44.556 --> 33:47.093
inviting the best
American entertainers

33:47.093 --> 33:48.694
regardless of race.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.930
* When the weatherman
brings the rain... *

33:51.930 --> 33:57.136
It was a formula I wanted
to replicate in our clubs.

33:57.136 --> 34:01.507
Hef decides Aretha Franklin
is talented

34:01.507 --> 34:03.542
when no one knew
who Aretha Franklin was.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.678
Today, she'll say that
the first time she performed

34:06.678 --> 34:08.480
for a white audience
and didn't have to enter

34:08.480 --> 34:11.283
through the kitchen
was a Playboy Club.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.319
And that was just
how Hef thought.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.887
I don't care what the rest
of the world thinks.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.989
I think this is good
and therefore it's worthy

34:17.989 --> 34:21.693
of exploring and exposing
our audience to, that was it.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.362
**

34:26.532 --> 34:28.134
**

34:28.134 --> 34:29.801
Along with Aretha Franklin,

34:29.801 --> 34:32.938
our club featured
many musicians on the rise,

34:32.938 --> 34:35.040
like Ray Charles...

34:35.040 --> 34:36.842
Sam Cooke...

34:36.842 --> 34:39.178
and Bette Midler.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.879
The best of entertainment,

34:40.879 --> 34:44.116
black and white,
went to the Playboy Club.

34:44.116 --> 34:47.018
And it really became
a social landmark.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.688
It was a place to be seen.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.124
Our Penthouse stage
featured top comedians

34:52.124 --> 34:53.725
like Milton Berle,

34:53.725 --> 34:56.662
edgy up-and-comers
like Steve Martin,

34:56.662 --> 34:58.464
George Carlin,

34:58.464 --> 35:01.032
and an unknown young comedian
named Dick Gregory,

35:01.032 --> 35:04.470
who we discovered at one
of the city's black nightclubs.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.037
'Cause everybody I meet
in the nightclub

35:06.037 --> 35:07.806
after they get drunk,
they all tell me the same thing.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.309
Greg, some of my best friends
are colored.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.145
And Mike, you know and I know

35:13.145 --> 35:15.147
there's not that
many of us to go around.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.118
At that time, black comics
had not been permitted

35:20.118 --> 35:23.455
to stand flat-footed
in a white nightclub and talk.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.393
Hefner brought me in
from there

35:27.393 --> 35:31.163
to Time magazine,
to the Jack Paar Show.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.868
When you look and see the role
that black comics played

35:36.868 --> 35:40.005
and the influence that
the Richard Pryors have had

35:40.005 --> 35:44.042
on white comics, all that
started because of Hefner.

35:44.042 --> 35:47.746
Thirty years from this year,
a Negro can become president.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.649
So treat me right, I'll get in
there and raise taxes on you.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.753
**

35:54.753 --> 35:56.422
With the entertainment,

35:56.422 --> 35:59.458
Bunnies and ambiance,

35:59.458 --> 36:01.627
we were finally giving
our readers

36:01.627 --> 36:04.363
the full Playboy experience.

36:06.732 --> 36:11.370
The food was good
and the drink was stiff.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.272
And the entertainment was nice.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.807
That's what made people
keep coming back.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.176
And the Bunnies
were part of the show.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.246
**

36:23.382 --> 36:24.950
* He's mine *

36:24.950 --> 36:27.653
* Yes she's really mine *

36:27.653 --> 36:29.788
The Bunnies
were an undeniable hit.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.058
And though we knew they would
earn big money in tips,

36:33.058 --> 36:35.427
our customers' generosity

36:35.427 --> 36:37.763
exceeded our wildest
expectations.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.931
Many of the customers
are aware that the girls

36:39.931 --> 36:42.801
are oft times making
more money than they are.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.237
That's interesting,
more money than the fellas

36:45.237 --> 36:46.972
who can afford
the $50 for the key?

36:46.972 --> 36:48.307
Oh, yes.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.908
Even Mike Wallace had to admit

36:49.908 --> 36:52.844
that the opportunity
we were giving our Bunnies

36:52.844 --> 36:54.112
was something special.

36:54.112 --> 36:57.649
* Let me know he's my baby *

36:57.649 --> 36:59.651
* He loves me so... *

36:59.651 --> 37:02.153
What we did was
we stuffed our costumes,

37:02.153 --> 37:04.055
and at the end of the night
when you unzipped it

37:04.055 --> 37:06.258
and you dropped it to the floor,
all the money was there

37:06.258 --> 37:08.827
so you wouldn't lose it
or forget it.

37:08.827 --> 37:09.961
**

37:09.961 --> 37:13.565
* When he pets me *

37:13.565 --> 37:17.235
* He's sweet and gentle **

37:17.235 --> 37:19.838
**

37:19.838 --> 37:22.007
Do, uh, the girls
date club members?

37:22.007 --> 37:26.278
Definitely not, you cannot
date members of the club.

37:26.278 --> 37:30.048
Our Bunnies were
our most valued employees,

37:30.048 --> 37:32.784
and we made protecting them
a top priority.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.989
From the beginning,
the personnel head

37:37.989 --> 37:40.191
of every Playboy Club
was a woman.

37:40.191 --> 37:41.860
That was the Bunny Mother.

37:41.860 --> 37:45.564
And there was a very,
very strong and strict culture

37:45.564 --> 37:48.600
around protecting
and respecting the women.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.837
So, at a time in which it was
very common for women

37:51.837 --> 37:56.375
to get hit on because they were
waitresses or working in a bar

37:56.375 --> 37:58.176
or for that matter
working in an office,

37:58.176 --> 37:59.845
let's think of Mad Men,

37:59.845 --> 38:02.748
this was an environment
in which women felt safe.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.453
Any hint of impropriety
between members and Bunnies

38:07.453 --> 38:10.656
would give ammunition
to our critics.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.925
So I made sure
that the no-dating rule

38:13.925 --> 38:15.561
was strictly enforced.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.503
At least,
for most of my guests.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.906
We did make exceptions
for a select group,

38:27.906 --> 38:30.676
a few friends
and trusted VIPs.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.006
Well, what can I say?

39:01.006 --> 39:04.410
Sometimes being the owner
has its perks.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.777
Can you shut
the door, Vic?

39:09.147 --> 39:12.651
**

39:12.651 --> 39:14.753
By the end
of the club's first year,

39:14.753 --> 39:17.723
we had over
100,000 key holders.

39:19.425 --> 39:22.327
* Back in the days
when we were young... *

39:22.327 --> 39:23.829
And we were pulling in

39:23.829 --> 39:28.166
the modern equivalent
of $33 million,

39:28.166 --> 39:30.702
doing higher volume
in food and drink

39:30.702 --> 39:33.805
than any other night
spot in the city.

39:33.805 --> 39:37.308
* But I have wanted
to walk away *

39:37.308 --> 39:40.045
* I just can't do it
even though I've tried *

39:40.045 --> 39:41.980
* Won't you come
back to me... *

39:41.980 --> 39:44.783
And there was something
about a Playboy Club

39:44.783 --> 39:48.019
that put it
in a class by itself.

39:48.019 --> 39:52.257
The Bunnies were
the stars of the club.

39:52.257 --> 39:54.626
And we treated them that way.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.294
And they loved it.

39:56.294 --> 39:58.664
And many of them were Bunnies
for many, many years.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.299
It was just a special place.

40:01.299 --> 40:06.204
The instant success of our club
made our next move obvious.

40:06.204 --> 40:09.107
We needed to go national.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.910
And there was no better place
to start...

40:11.910 --> 40:14.012
* Set me free **

40:14.012 --> 40:16.448
...than New York.

40:18.650 --> 40:22.654
* Every little movement *

40:22.654 --> 40:26.758
* Every motion
of your hips *

40:26.758 --> 40:29.895
* I feel the compulsion *

40:29.895 --> 40:35.433
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

40:35.433 --> 40:39.304
* Is it a black magic spell *

40:39.304 --> 40:41.172
* You put me under? *

40:42.841 --> 40:46.545
* This miracle moment *

40:46.545 --> 40:50.549
* Never let it end *

40:50.549 --> 40:54.586
* Every little movement *

40:54.586 --> 40:58.657
* Is beyond improvement *

40:58.657 --> 41:01.527
* You are the magician *

41:01.527 --> 41:06.765
* I've been wishing for
forever *

41:06.765 --> 41:10.569
* Every little movement *

41:10.569 --> 41:13.705
* Every
little movement **
