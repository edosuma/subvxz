WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.310
[Jughead] Well,
it's not every day you learn
that you're at ground zero

00:06.354 --> 00:07.877
of an extinction-level event.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.271
In less than 18 hours,

00:10.314 --> 00:13.187
Bailey's Comet was going to
obliterate Riverdale,

00:13.230 --> 00:17.104
one last twist of the knife,
courtesy of Percival Pickens.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.454
And there was nothing
we could do to stop it

00:19.497 --> 00:21.456
or apparently escape.

00:21.499 --> 00:22.761
What did you find out?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.589
I've had the Serpents out
all night,

00:24.633 --> 00:27.462
on every road
and every highway.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.072
And all along
the town's limits,

00:29.116 --> 00:31.074
there's some sort of
invisible barrier

00:31.118 --> 00:33.076
completely surrounding
Riverdale,

00:33.120 --> 00:34.512
and it's keeping us
from leaving it.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.688
Yeah, it gets crazier, though.

00:36.732 --> 00:40.431
When we were out there
on the highway,
a car drove into town.

00:40.475 --> 00:43.130
Like there was no barrier.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.524
So it's basically, like,
we're trapped in a roach motel.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.135
You can get in,
but you can't get out.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.180
Jughead, what about
opening up a portal?

00:50.224 --> 00:52.182
I mean, I'll take any dimension
over this one at the moment.

00:52.226 --> 00:56.230
I tried. I can only open
portals within town limits.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.492
No other dimension.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.580
[Archie] Tabitha,
what about you?

00:58.623 --> 01:00.103
Have you tried to time travel?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.453
Every time line I've gone to,
past and future,

01:02.497 --> 01:06.457
there's always a comet
that's about to destroy
Riverdale imminently.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.546
-How the hell
is this happening?
-It's Percival.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.026
But was he
really powerful enough

01:10.070 --> 01:12.028
to get Bailey's Comet
to change course?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.291
-I mean, it's a comet.
-He is

01:14.335 --> 01:16.467
and powerful enough
to weave the binding spell

01:16.511 --> 01:18.730
that's keeping us all
trapped here.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.732
Shouldn't, like, the government
try to shoot the comet
out of the sky or something?

01:20.776 --> 01:21.820
Why isn't this
all over the Internet?

01:21.864 --> 01:23.257
It's a facet of the spell.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.259
Percival doesn't want
anyone to help us,

01:25.302 --> 01:28.175
so as far as the world
is concerned,
Bailey's Comet is passing

01:28.218 --> 01:31.700
over Riverdale tonight,
as it has every 65 years.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.136
Great. So that's it then.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.616
We're all going to die.

01:34.659 --> 01:35.965
I'm so happy
I moved here sophomore year.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.880
Well, not everyone's
going to die.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.229
Archie's invulnerable.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.275
What about Big Anthony?

01:41.318 --> 01:42.885
-He's immortal.
-Archie and I have already
talked about that.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.235
They might be the only ones
that survive this,

01:45.279 --> 01:47.977
especially if they're
in the bunker
when the comet hits.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.326
Uh, let's not go there yet.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.763
We have enough time
to make sure we all survive.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.852
Percival was a sorcerer

01:53.896 --> 01:57.204
and pulling down the comet
and making this barrier
are all spells he cast.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.293
They are spells, Archie,

01:59.336 --> 02:05.255
incredibly elaborate ones
rooted in dark, arcane magics
honed over centuries.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.736
-Far beyond my knowledge.
-And mine.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.260
But there might be someone
we can consult

02:10.304 --> 02:12.175
with ancient knowledge
that rivals Percival's.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
Okay, great. In the meantime,
Frank and I

02:14.351 --> 02:16.658
and anyone else who wants
to help, we're going to go
into the mines.

02:16.701 --> 02:20.183
If we dig deep enough,
maybe we'll find a tunnel
that passes under the barrier.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.184
[scoffs]

02:21.228 --> 02:22.838
[Alice] Whatever happens,

02:22.881 --> 02:26.189
I'm just so grateful
that we can face it together

02:26.233 --> 02:27.364
as a family.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.800
But I am so sorry

02:28.844 --> 02:31.455
that I can't protect you girls
from what's coming.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.240
It's a comet, Mom.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.937
And I am so sorry

02:34.980 --> 02:36.504
that I wasn't a better mother.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.680
-I was awful.
-No.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.770
-Mom, we're okay.
-[crying]

02:41.813 --> 02:45.165
We know that you would do
anything for us.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.645
And we love you.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.345
So, so, so much.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.085
[sobbing] I love you, too.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.353
How does it feel to be back?

02:59.396 --> 03:03.270
Unsettling,
but I'm still hoping
for an eleventh-hour save.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.054
Speaking of,
I have something for you.

03:07.187 --> 03:11.278
I saved it from Percival's shop
before we burned it down.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.541
I really can't seem
to get rid of this thing,
can I?

03:14.455 --> 03:15.412
[sighs]

03:16.979 --> 03:18.198
Thank you, Reggie.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.114
[Jughead] You know,
all things considered,

03:22.158 --> 03:23.812
there are definitely more
banal ways to go out

03:23.855 --> 03:27.424
than being obliterated
by a giant magic comet.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.992
And I've actually completed
almost everything
on my bucket list.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.260
Alexandra Cabot?

03:37.304 --> 03:38.653
Tabitha Tate?

03:39.828 --> 03:41.438
What are you doing here?

03:41.482 --> 03:44.920
Well, I am here to make
all your dreams come true.

03:47.444 --> 03:48.793
[slurping] Mmm.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.361
Every time.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.797
Okay, so...

03:52.841 --> 03:54.582
You've heard
of Tommy Comet's, right?

03:54.625 --> 03:56.323
The diner chain
that went belly up.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.107
Yeah, well,

03:58.150 --> 04:02.242
I have just closed a deal
to buy all of their facilities,

04:02.285 --> 04:04.200
which means

04:04.244 --> 04:09.031
that we can take them over
and open up Pop's diners
across the country ASAP.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.903
Instant franchising.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.254
Investors are lined up
and we're good
on the financials.

04:14.297 --> 04:20.303
So all I need from you,
Tabitha, is an immediate yes.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.394
Alexandra,
this is amazing news.

04:24.438 --> 04:27.005
But what? Just say yes.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.964
The thing is, your timing...

04:29.007 --> 04:31.662
I just think it's a lot
to take in right now.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.316
[phone ringing]

04:33.360 --> 04:35.884
Okay. And this is
one of my investors right now.

04:35.927 --> 04:39.104
Um, I'm staying
at the Five Seasons.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.542
Think on it.
But you have ten hours
to decide.

04:41.585 --> 04:45.372
And I promise you
this is truly the opportunity
of a lifetime.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.246
Hi, this is Alexandra.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.038
There you go.

05:01.562 --> 05:02.432
All done.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.262
So does this mean
I'm a real Serpent now?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.307
[sighs]

05:08.438 --> 05:10.222
Not just the Serpent.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.790
Serpent King.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.184
Anthony, you're our son.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.274
And you've got the best shot
of surviving whatever's coming.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.537
And it's up to you to make sure
the Serpents don't die out,

05:20.581 --> 05:22.931
and being king
is your birthright,

05:22.974 --> 05:30.155
and that's why it's up to you
to make sure that that legacy,
our legacy, continues, okay?

05:30.199 --> 05:31.113
Yes, Mom.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.900
[both] Return to us,
Spirit from beyond.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.207
Abigail Blossom,
we asked to correspond.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.428
We seek your wisdom,
help an insight appear
before us,

05:41.471 --> 05:43.560
sister of the night.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.388
Pray tell, why have I
been conjured?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.999
Abigail, hi.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.219
We need your help.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.352
An evil sorcerer has called
a comet down upon us

05:52.395 --> 05:55.746
-and bound us to this town
so that no one can leave it.
-Good.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
Why for should I help you?

05:57.618 --> 06:00.055
Listen, I think we may have
gotten off on the wrong foot.

06:00.098 --> 06:03.928
So, yes, I'm asking you
to show a little mercy.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.978
Also I'll free you
from that ceramic hell doll.

06:10.021 --> 06:13.460
A long, long time ago,
when I was still alive,

06:13.503 --> 06:17.986
I spent
the most sublime evening
with my beloved Thomasina.

06:18.029 --> 06:21.555
She was an astronomer
and a scientist
as well as a witch.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.949
It's called Bailey's Comet.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.566
[sighs] It's... beautiful.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.482
Just like you.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.049
What's it made of?

06:38.093 --> 06:39.921
Ice, my love.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.925
Comets are made of ice.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.622
I hear what goes on
in this house.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.712
You possess the power
of the Phoenix, don't you?

06:48.756 --> 06:52.455
As soon as the comet
gets close enough to Earth,
project your power at it.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.239
And melt it?

06:55.632 --> 06:58.635
That's kind of basic,
but also kind of genius.

06:58.679 --> 07:03.553
But if it is to work,
it will require
all of your Phoenix power.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.207
And such an effort
will come at a cost.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.296
What about Percival's trap?

07:07.339 --> 07:09.472
Can you help us
undo his binding spell?

07:09.516 --> 07:12.257
Mayhap, though that will take
a greater effort to undo.

07:12.301 --> 07:15.217
Therefore, in exchange,
I will require

07:15.260 --> 07:18.568
something more
than an appeal and my freedom.

07:18.612 --> 07:19.917
Okay, we're listening.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.703
[Cheryl] All my underworlders!

07:22.746 --> 07:26.271
Any luck finding
a safe passageway out?

07:26.576 --> 07:28.491
Not yet.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.275
Every time we follow a tunnel
that leads us

07:30.319 --> 07:32.582
to what should be
the edge of town,
we hit the barrier.

07:32.626 --> 07:36.586
Luckily, I may have divined
a pathway through our
little conundrum.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.849
Come, come.
Everyone's gathered
at Thornhill.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.679
Listen up, Riverdalians.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.508
Thanks to some
ancestral advice,

07:45.552 --> 07:47.118
I believe I might,

07:47.162 --> 07:49.904
might be able to melt
the comet
with my Phoenix powers.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.688
Whoa, that's incredible news.

07:51.732 --> 07:54.474
And there may also be a way
to undo Percival's
binding spells

07:54.517 --> 07:56.432
so that we can evacuate
the town.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.567
But, Toni, you and I need
to speak about that privately.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.743
Okay.

08:02.786 --> 08:05.354
Hold on. Is it really as easy
as melting the comet?

08:05.876 --> 08:07.182
No, Veronica.

08:07.225 --> 08:11.273
There is one huge catch.

08:11.316 --> 08:16.191
It will take
all of my Phoenix energies
to extinguish Bailey's Comet,

08:16.234 --> 08:19.934
which means if I successfully
melt the comet,

08:19.977 --> 08:24.286
one or more of the dead
I've resurrected
will surely perish.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.984
What? Wait. Why?

08:27.028 --> 08:31.554
Because it is my powers
that are keeping
the resurrected dead alive.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.599
Who knew?

08:32.642 --> 08:34.383
So, who is on
the chopping block

08:34.426 --> 08:35.384
exactly?

08:35.776 --> 08:36.951
Archie.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.387
Jughead.

08:38.430 --> 08:39.649
Polly.

08:39.693 --> 08:40.520
My Nana.

08:40.824 --> 08:41.912
Dagwood.

08:42.478 --> 08:43.740
Alice.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.568
Frank, Sheriff Keller,

08:45.612 --> 08:48.702
Fangs and Toni,

08:48.745 --> 08:53.663
if Riverdale is to live,
one or many of you

08:53.707 --> 08:57.537
or your loved ones, must die.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.372
[Toni] What can I do
to help, Cheryl?

09:07.416 --> 09:10.419
My ancestor, the witch,
Abigail Blossom,

09:10.462 --> 09:13.553
is going to help us
figure out a way
to break Percival's spell

09:13.596 --> 09:16.599
and escape Riverdale's borders.

09:16.643 --> 09:20.777
But first, she wants to spend
one final evening

09:20.821 --> 09:26.435
with her beloved
in carnal form,

09:26.478 --> 09:28.959
and we need two vessels
to make that happen.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.223
I would be Abigail's

09:32.267 --> 09:36.532
and you,
pending your agreement,

09:37.402 --> 09:38.795
would be her beloved

09:38.839 --> 09:42.625
Thomasina Topaz, your ancestor
who was also a witch.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.715
Okay, but what about Fangs
and Heather?

09:45.759 --> 09:47.456
Well, Heather's a witch.

09:47.499 --> 09:52.983
So she's kind of fine
with whatevs. As for Fangs...

09:53.897 --> 09:56.073
it isn't technically cheating.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.640
I mean,
our souls will be elsewhere.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.816
Okay. And where would
our souls be, exactly?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.862
Not to worry.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.646
Heather will keep
our spirits in a jar
until the lovemaking ends.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.257
[door thuds]

10:09.870 --> 10:11.872
There you are.

10:11.915 --> 10:15.397
Mom, you,
you shouldn't be here.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.703
What are you talking about?

10:18.356 --> 10:19.488
Why are you covered in dirt?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.446
I'm on a job.

10:22.796 --> 10:23.666
Let me get cleaned up.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.804
Archie,

10:30.847 --> 10:33.720
one of the reasons
why I came back was

10:33.763 --> 10:36.766
I want to tell you
that Brooke and I
are getting a divorce.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.029
What? What happened?

10:39.073 --> 10:40.204
I thought
you two got along great.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.945
Oh, we do get along.

10:41.989 --> 10:46.210
Just we also both realize
that we don't want to spend

10:46.254 --> 10:48.691
the rest of our lives together,
and it's okay.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.779
You know, it happens.

10:49.823 --> 10:53.653
But life... life is precious.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.873
And you don't want to waste
a single minute.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.048
You know?

11:02.923 --> 11:05.055
Cheers, Daddy.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.145
And hopefully,
whatever happens,

11:08.189 --> 11:10.278
we don't cross paths
in the afterlife.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.135
[sighs]

11:42.049 --> 11:43.485
[knock at door]

11:44.051 --> 11:45.356
What's going on?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.793
Good news about the comet,
I hope?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.272
No, um...

11:49.534 --> 11:50.753
personal news actually.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.756
I'm going to ask Betty
to marry me.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.021
-What?
-Yeah.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.589
-Today?
-I was going to use a ring
my dad gave me,

12:00.632 --> 12:03.853
but I lost it,
probably in the explosion.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.637
So since I don't have
a lot of time,

12:05.681 --> 12:09.293
I was wondering if you might
still have some rings

12:09.337 --> 12:11.687
from the jewelry shop
you used to run.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.428
-Uh...
-I'm sorry if that's
a weird thing to ask.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.864
No, no, not at all.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.779
Um, actually...

12:17.867 --> 12:18.955
Yeah.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.088
You're in luck, Archie.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.612
I have an amazing diamond ring
in my personal stash
that Betty would flip for.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.535
But franchising Pop's
has been your dream.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.711
You've been protecting
the diner all year.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.887
This is the best way
to ensure its longevity.

12:37.931 --> 12:41.717
Honestly, as long as there's
a giant hunk of ice hurtling
towards us,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.806
I'm not committing to anything,

12:43.850 --> 12:46.809
though, I do appreciate
you willing to be the Jack
to my Rose.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.289
Who?

12:48.332 --> 12:49.812
Jack and Rose,

12:49.856 --> 12:52.032
from Titanic,
Leonardo DiCaprio,
Kate Winslet.

12:52.075 --> 12:55.122
-Oh.
-Jack dies so that Rose
can fulfill all of her dreams

12:55.165 --> 12:58.081
like flying solo
around the world.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.169
Never seen the Titanic.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.823
-What?
-I know, I know.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.956
I'm more partial to, like,
early James Cameron.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.914
Jughead,
you've gotta be kidding.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.177
The Titanicis one
of my favorite movies
of, like, all time.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.483
We have to watch it.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.877
-We have to watch it.
-Yes.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.530
Isn't that, like,
four hours long?

13:12.574 --> 13:15.055
Three hours and 14 minutes.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.535
Look, I know
the clock is ticking.

13:17.579 --> 13:20.364
But trust me,
we need to do this.

13:32.637 --> 13:33.856
If you're ready, let's begin.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.865
Hear ye, hear ye,
great above.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.954
Send two spirits deep in love.

13:44.998 --> 13:48.001
Take these vessels
for the night
and earthly realm to reunite.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.002
Switch the souls,

13:49.045 --> 13:51.004
let flesh remain,
shake thy broom,

13:51.047 --> 13:51.918
that love of flame.

13:58.011 --> 14:01.928
Abigail, can this truly
be happening?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.016
Yes.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.322
Yes, my love. This is real.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.716
Come. We have oh so much
to catch up on.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.508
She's in Riverdale.

15:00.551 --> 15:03.206
Oh, my God, Did you tell her
about the comet?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.469
I didn't. I mean,
where would I even start?

15:05.513 --> 15:06.993
Arch, you got to tell her.

15:07.994 --> 15:08.908
Yeah, maybe.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.649
But first...

15:14.087 --> 15:15.262
What are you doing?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.834
We may not have much time,

15:24.227 --> 15:25.794
but I know what
I want to do with it.

15:28.753 --> 15:29.624
Marry me.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.801
There's a comet coming.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.978
-And I want to be
with you for it.
-Then be with me.

15:39.982 --> 15:40.852
Arch,

15:42.637 --> 15:44.334
I love you so much.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.163
That's not part of my
hesitation, okay?

15:47.207 --> 15:49.861
But can we talk about
what's going on with you
right now?

15:53.126 --> 15:57.086
You put so much pressure
on yourself to be a hero,

15:57.130 --> 15:59.393
when you already are one.

15:59.436 --> 16:02.483
Sometimes you
can't save everyone.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.920
Sometimes you can
just be scared.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.314
And that's okay.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.881
It's human.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.891
Do you remember
when we were kids

16:19.935 --> 16:21.632
and you asked me
to marry you?

16:23.112 --> 16:26.681
And I told you to ask me again
when we turned 18.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.204
So how about this?

16:29.510 --> 16:30.902
Ask me again

16:31.816 --> 16:34.254
after Cheryl melts that comet

16:34.297 --> 16:35.603
and you and me

16:35.646 --> 16:39.041
and everyone else survives.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.348
Or we find another way out
of Riverdale.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.221
Deal?

16:53.316 --> 16:54.622
I'm gonna do that for us.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.105
Where are you going?

16:59.148 --> 17:01.933
[sighs] I'm gonna break through
that barrier

17:02.673 --> 17:04.066
so I can marry you,

17:04.110 --> 17:05.024
Betty Cooper.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.070
[sighs]

17:23.825 --> 17:28.090
-Cheryl?
-Yes, Toni.

17:28.134 --> 17:32.486
-[speaking French]
-[in English] Do you
remember anything?

17:33.356 --> 17:34.270
No.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.360
-You?
-No.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.015
No, um... Neither do I.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.281
Toni?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.594
-Thank you.
-Of course.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.076
Anything to possibly
save the town.

18:08.174 --> 18:13.222
So tell me, dearest ancestor,
how was your tryst
with Thomasina?

18:13.266 --> 18:16.573
Beyond my wildest imaginings.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.488
-Thank you, Cheryl.
-Of course.

18:18.532 --> 18:22.144
But now tell me,
how do we undo
Percival's binding spell?

18:22.188 --> 18:23.798
Look there on the altar.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.715
What is that?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.673
The knots represent
the various mystical barriers
surrounding the town.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.719
Once the rope is untied
completely,

18:31.762 --> 18:33.851
you and the others should be
able to leave Riverdale.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.508
Agent Cooper,
it's been a minute.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.032
Drake, hi.

18:41.076 --> 18:44.558
Yeah. Things have only gotten
more insane since TBK.

18:44.601 --> 18:48.301
If you can believe that.
What's up?

18:48.344 --> 18:52.392
Director Wilcox wants us
to head up the FBI
serial killer division.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.480
Oh, my God.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.179
That's quite the promotion.

18:57.223 --> 19:00.226
The thing is,
there's a lot going on

19:00.269 --> 19:01.618
in my life right now.

19:01.662 --> 19:05.056
I'm, sort of,
in a transitional period.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.841
You know, weighing my options

19:07.755 --> 19:09.365
for the future.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.498
But, Betty, there's no better
hunter of hunters than you are.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.935
I think that chapter of my life
is over.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.590
Being a hunter of hunters,

19:18.331 --> 19:20.420
I mean, I don't want that
carved on my gravestone.

19:20.463 --> 19:26.295
[chuckles] I hate asking,
but is this because of Archie

19:26.339 --> 19:30.169
or because TBK messed
with your head?

19:30.212 --> 19:31.213
No.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.086
This has nothing to do
with TBK or Archie.

19:35.130 --> 19:39.308
This is all... This is me.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.529
It's my decision
about how I want to spend
the rest of my life,

19:42.572 --> 19:45.619
-for however long
that might be.
-Doing what?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.316
I'm moving towards the light.

19:50.754 --> 19:51.799
Take care, Drake.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.540
And don't be a stranger.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.194
-Bye.
-[call closing chime]

19:58.762 --> 20:01.330
So, Ronnie, if we survive,

20:01.374 --> 20:03.811
-what's the first thing
you're gonna do, you think?
-Hmm.

20:05.682 --> 20:09.860
-Maybe a shopping spree
in Paris with Katie.
-Oh.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.949
-You?
-Get a dog.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.169
-Aw.
-I always wanted one.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.259
-[chuckles]
-Name him... Vader.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.045
-Yeah.
-That's sweet.

20:24.397 --> 20:28.227
Reggie, the reason
I asked you over,

20:28.270 --> 20:31.360
should we still be here
this time tomorrow,

20:31.404 --> 20:34.407
I want you to have
the Babylonium. Sole ownership.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.017
-Wait. Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.412
-How come?
-The casino was your idea.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.414
Your baby.

20:41.457 --> 20:45.418
The only thing
that's really mine
is my absinthe.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.333
Maybe I'll focus on that.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.509
And should the sun
rise tomorrow,

20:49.552 --> 20:53.208
and we find ourselves
no longer business partners,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.428
any chance you and I
get back together?

20:55.471 --> 20:59.301
Tempting, but no.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.565
I think it's good we're
off that carousel ride,
don't you?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.915
Mmm-hmm.

21:04.959 --> 21:09.268
And besides, if there is
another chapter for me still,

21:10.573 --> 21:12.445
I think it's time
for a hard reboot.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.099
On all fronts.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.319
Instead of being
so relationship focused,

21:17.363 --> 21:21.497
I'll be single and fabulous
and date a lot,

21:23.760 --> 21:25.458
work on my friendship skills.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.025
Starting with,

21:28.069 --> 21:31.246
if you're amenable,
you, Reggie.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.293
Yeah, I'm down to be friend
zoned by you, Ronnie.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.077
Good.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.298
Cheers to that, Reggie.

21:41.474 --> 21:45.826
And if you want,
when it's comet time,
you can come over

21:45.869 --> 21:47.741
and we can watch
the fireworks together.

21:47.784 --> 21:48.959
Sounds good.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.093
-As...
-Yes, Reggie, as friends.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.660
Okay. Just checking.

22:01.015 --> 22:03.322
I had no idea.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.673
Right! It's amazing,
isn't it?

22:09.850 --> 22:11.460
You know,
you know how it's
going to end.

22:11.504 --> 22:15.986
But... it's still a gut punch.

22:16.030 --> 22:19.381
Couldn't they have
both held on to the drift
wood of the end, though?

22:19.425 --> 22:23.037
No, because it wouldn't
have supported them both.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.649
Jack knew that
they would have sunk, so...

22:26.693 --> 22:30.827
he let go
so that Rose could live.

22:30.871 --> 22:33.830
I mean,
the resonances are startling.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.398
Only you're
a lot cuter than Leo.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.268
In my opinion.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.447
Can you just
make me a promise?

22:41.490 --> 22:44.363
No matter what happens,
if Cheryl stops this comet

22:44.406 --> 22:47.801
or if I live or I die, that you
take Alexandra up on her offer.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.759
Take Pop's national.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.892
-Jughead.
-I won't be able to die

22:51.935 --> 22:59.639
or live peacefully.
If you don't swear to me,
and you're an angel.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.902
So I'm pretty sure
that means you can't lie.

23:01.945 --> 23:06.863
-Can you just swear,
no matter what happens...
-Okay, I swear.

23:06.907 --> 23:10.171
But in exchange,
I just want you to agree

23:10.214 --> 23:17.570
to go on one
last epic date with me.

23:17.613 --> 23:22.531
Okay, but define epic because
we're trapped in Riverdale

23:22.575 --> 23:26.317
and time
is now appallingly finite.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.363
Not for me.

23:28.407 --> 23:33.803
I'm chronokinetic, remember?
All I need is one minute.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.417
-One minute?
-That's all we'll need.

23:46.076 --> 23:48.035
[soft music playing]

24:35.299 --> 24:37.867
Archie, why didn't you pick up?

24:37.911 --> 24:39.956
I've been calling you.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.655
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

24:42.698 --> 24:46.572
-You don't understand.
-I do. Betty
told me everything.

24:46.615 --> 24:51.968
About Percival,
about you dying and Cheryl
bringing you back to life.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.362
I mean, my God, Archie.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.190
-Did she also tell you--
-About the comet?

24:56.233 --> 24:58.714
Yes, Yes, she did.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.460
And about how now,
I'm... I'm trapped, too.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.386
I'm sorry, Mom.

25:18.429 --> 25:21.781
I'm sorry you got caught up
in all this insanity.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.566

no one has to die.

the less chance her powers
will be used up.

41:32.794 --> 41:35.623
The night before,
the actor and teen idol
James Dean

41:35.667 --> 41:38.670
had died
in a car crash in California.

41:38.713 --> 41:43.675
Somehow the year is 1955,
and somehow Archie Andrews

41:43.718 --> 41:47.766
and all of his friends,
me included,
are teenagers again

41:47.809 --> 41:52.292
and I'm the only
one who remembers what
our lives were like BC.

41:53.206 --> 41:54.512
Before the comet.
