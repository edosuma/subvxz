WEBVTT

01:25.919 --> 01:27.838
I've been looking everywhere for this.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.176
Wait, sorry,
you've been looking everywhere for

01:32.176 --> 01:36.054
<i>The Hierarchies of Cuckoldry
and Bankruptcy</i> by Charles Forrier?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.890
- Fourier.
- Fourier.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.225
The writer had
a lot of revolutionary ideas,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.102
but was also funny as hell.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.899
"Fourier offers a caustic critique
of a civilization

01:46.899 --> 01:49.193
that overregulates sexual congress

01:49.193 --> 01:52.362
while allowing the financial sector
to screw over the public."

01:53.322 --> 01:55.782
Sounds hilarious.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.243
I've never heard you
talk about him before.

01:58.243 --> 02:02.706
- Well, it's not for me. It's a gift.
- Cool.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.626
For who?

02:05.626 --> 02:06.710
Iggy.

02:07.503 --> 02:08.878
From <i>Land of A Thousand Dances.</i>

02:08.878 --> 02:10.214
His real name's Nicky,

02:10.214 --> 02:12.674
which I can tell you because
you're gonna meet him on New Year's.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.885
He's having a party at his place.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.637
It's this squat in Chinatown.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.389
So filthy, but so fun.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.892
And also surprisingly educational.

02:21.892 --> 02:25.145
He was kind of, sort of in Ex Post Facto.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.231
So this guy's basically,
like, a legend to you?

02:27.231 --> 02:29.107
Not that I would ever let him know that.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.529
The key to meeting your heroes

02:33.529 --> 02:36.365
is pretending
like you do not give a shit about them.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.410
Thought the key was to never meet them.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.330
And it kind of seems like you do care,

02:43.330 --> 02:46.333
since you're getting him,
like, a present and stuff, so...

02:46.333 --> 02:48.252
Well, I'm buying him a book.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.837
I buy books for people, Charles.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.547
I gift knowledge.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.590
Well, you've never gotten one for me.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.344
I'm gonna get you one.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.431
<i>"Corduroy"</i>?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.936
So, it's about this bear
who loses a button.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.521
You're gonna love it.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.195
- Could have asked me to smile.
- That seemed like a tall order.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.156
It wasn't of you.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.367
That street art.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.124
Stop gentrification.
Save the city you love.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.007
- Hey, I have a question.
- Yeah?

03:35.007 --> 03:38.385
Why are we trying to save the thing
that we actively burned down?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.346
Sometimes you have to
set the world on fire to fix it.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.682
You've heard Nicky.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.769
I don't know.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.479
I don't really get
what he's talking about.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.274
But it beats county jail
or the back of Sol's van.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.528
We help Nicky with his missions,
and he takes care of us.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.780
Some dude in a suit pushes an envelope

03:58.780 --> 04:02.201
of cash through the mail slot
once a month. I try not to analyze it.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.037
Wait, someone pays for that place?

04:05.704 --> 04:09.208
Yeah, we have toilets that flush.
You should go by C-Squat sometime.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.712
Speaking of, I gotta pee.
Think we put in our time here.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.757
Dump, like, a dozen flyers.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.257
Not enough to make Nicky suspicious,

04:18.257 --> 04:20.844
but enough to make it seem
like we changed some hearts and minds.

04:55.629 --> 05:00.634
Hey. Twenty for a hand job.
Fifty for head.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.261
The second one.

05:04.263 --> 05:08.225
Okay. I'm gonna
need the cash first though, please.

05:36.211 --> 05:40.215
- We gotta go.
- You're under arrest, Tinker Bell.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.557
- What the fuck, Charlie?
- Let's go.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.105
Shit.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.454
Officer!

06:24.176 --> 06:25.177
Go! Come on!

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
Shit.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.808
- Sorry.
- Sorry!

06:42.694 --> 06:45.489
Like I said, you're under arrest.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.007
Better be good.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.093
Sorry, this a bad time?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.346
I'm at that appointment,
I think I mentioned.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.684
So you really got your hands full?

07:14.768 --> 07:18.272
Hey, real quick, did we get an ID
off the CCTV cam at the dorm?

07:18.272 --> 07:22.609
Back of the guy's head. He's tall,
clean-cut like Panda Girl said.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.487
But that's not why I'm calling.

07:29.575 --> 07:32.494
William Hamilton-Sweeney
is asking for you.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.707
He's the owner of the suit
Mr. Goodman was wearing

07:36.707 --> 07:38.709
the night of Samantha's shooting.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.545
Also, he's one of those <i>Hamilton-Sweeneys</i>.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.338
All right, well, keep him there.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.467
He's not going anywhere.
He got picked up for solicitation.

07:48.051 --> 07:52.514
Tried to run. Seems Mr. Goodman
left your card in his pants,

07:52.514 --> 07:54.975
<i>and now he thinks
he's got a friend in the department.</i>

07:54.975 --> 07:56.435
Wow. Okay.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.021
Al, are you on a call?

07:59.771 --> 08:01.356
No, I'll be there soon.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.985
I just had to get that out of the way
so I could focus.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.987
This is hard for me, you know?

08:08.113 --> 08:10.991
- My mother would not approve.
- Now you're thinking about your mother?

08:10.991 --> 08:14.536
Ali, your mom wants grandkids.
She's not gonna ask where they came from.

08:24.338 --> 08:28.634
Will, I can't find your basketball jersey.
Can you just wear a fucking T-shirt?

08:29.968 --> 08:31.887
No, I want my jersey.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.058
Hi, Stu. I'll be there by 10:00.
I have to get the kids to camp.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.104
Okay, because I think I saw a fax I
wasn't supposed to see.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.649
- <i>And you're gonna wanna see it too.</i>
- What is it?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.699
You would know better than me.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.618
I'm just gonna put it in a drawer
in your desk.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.038
<i>Okay, thanks. Bye.</i>

08:58.038 --> 08:59.122
Okay, thanks.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.205
Hey, you! I see you.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.749
Same as I told you before,

09:42.749 --> 09:45.836
if you're not
on anybody's approved visitor list,

09:45.836 --> 09:49.214
- you don't get to visit anybody.
- I know, but I come in peace.

09:49.923 --> 09:54.720
- I don't trust your face. Go. Now.
- Okay. Sorry.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.485
- Music isn't too loud?
- Not at all.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.030
Hopefully, it brightens up her day.
And yours.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.824
I'm gonna go grab a coffee. Bring you one?

10:16.491 --> 10:17.618
Much appreciated, Mr. Yeung.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.995
- Cream and sugar?
- Sounds good.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.788
Are you a reporter?

10:22.372 --> 10:25.000
- Do I need to call security?
- No.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.844
- Hey.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

10:36.470 --> 10:38.639
- Where are you?
- <i>I was on my way to the office.</i>

10:38.639 --> 10:40.766
- Same.
- But I need you to redirect over here.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.684
- There's a problem.
- What kind of problem?

10:42.684 --> 10:45.646
- Just get here as soon as you can, okay?
- No, what's going on?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.814
Regan, it's more than a little
out of my way.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.067
<i>It's Will. It's serious, Keith.</i>

10:50.943 --> 10:54.112
Breaking up. Bad cell spot.
But yeah, I'll be right there.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.127
The person I came to see
already checked out.

11:09.628 --> 11:12.422
Maybe whoever you're visiting
would want these?

11:16.134 --> 11:19.680
Daisies are her favorite. How'd you know?

11:35.237 --> 11:36.405
He's leaving.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.156
- Follow him.
- Will do.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.547
Without the curls, there's no way
anyone will recognize you.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.675
Except for every other aspect
of my appearance.

11:56.675 --> 12:01.388
- Starting with my face.
- Okay. Check it out.

12:02.014 --> 12:04.641
My masterpiece is complete.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.025
What's wrong? You look cute.

12:13.025 --> 12:15.611
Not all guys could pull this off,
but you have a really good head shape.

12:15.611 --> 12:18.280
It's not the haircut.
Though that's not really helping.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.364
Then what?

12:19.364 --> 12:22.159
What have I done? I'm a wanted man.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.037
Sam's still in a coma.
I have no idea who shot her.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.581
And also,
I got talked into bombing a building.

12:28.165 --> 12:32.169
- So I'm, like, a bomber now.
- Hey. It's okay.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.213
I just have a bad feeling.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.799
You know, you're not the only person
who's ever had these thoughts.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.552
This is what it's like
when you first break away

12:40.552 --> 12:42.387
from the regular world and come live here.

12:48.352 --> 12:52.105
What the hell is going on here?
Are those my clippers?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.609
- Those are my clippers.
- Hey! Go easy on him.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.446
If you ask me, we've all gone
a little too easy on this kid.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.408
- Stop!
- Hey, except nobody asked you, Sol.

13:03.408 --> 13:07.371
Charlie needs us. He's a fugitive, okay?
There's wanted posters.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.623
What? Then he can't stay here.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.960
Nicky, he'll bring too much heat.
It ain't enough to shave his curly locks.

13:15.254 --> 13:19.049
Nah, you're safe here, Prophet.
And we protect our own.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.969
We avenge those who cross us.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.895
<i>So, you're the roommate.</i>

13:32.563 --> 13:34.314
He uses that one on strangers too, huh?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.403
Thought it was just his mom.
I suppose my reputation precedes me.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.821
Well, your drug habit does.

13:41.572 --> 13:44.074
But solicitation? That is a new one.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.995
Relax. I wasn't actually going to do it.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.831
I was just gonna take the money and run.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.834
So much more honorable. You know,
Mercer seems like a nice guy.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.627
- I thought he'd have better taste.
- Right,

13:55.627 --> 13:58.630
I have been trying
to tell him that for a long time.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.758
He's too good for this world.
Wouldn't last a minute behind bars.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.843
And you would?

14:02.843 --> 14:08.056
That is why I am trying
to appeal to your better angels.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.392
Like you said, this is my first offense,

14:10.392 --> 14:14.146
and I am just trying to figure out
whether it makes sense

14:14.146 --> 14:18.233
for this fine police department
to use all of its resources

14:18.233 --> 14:19.526
to try and prosecute me.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.863
Absolutely. Maybe a little prison time
would be good for you.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.866
There's no better way to kick a habit
than cold turkey in a jail cell.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.243
I have been living in my studio,

14:28.243 --> 14:31.663
and I didn't want
Mercer to see all of this.

14:32.664 --> 14:38.045
Detective, I'm guilty of obstinance,
false pride, terrible judgment...

14:40.923 --> 14:42.758
but not prostitution.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.094
All right.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.141
Say if I can get
these charges dropped, you know,

14:51.141 --> 14:54.019
convince the undercover vice cop
you were just being friendly,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.147
what would you do for me? For Mercer?

14:57.147 --> 14:59.316
You gonna check into rehab?
Go to an NA meeting?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.486
- What if I help you solve this case?
- Excuse me?

15:02.486 --> 15:07.533
I mean, I've been staring
at this wall for a while now,

15:07.533 --> 15:08.867
waiting for you.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.786
And those dots.

15:11.787 --> 15:15.499
This is all for the girl
who was shot in Central Park, right?

15:15.499 --> 15:17.209
- The one that Mercer found.
- Yeah.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.045
And have you figured out
that this is me yet?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.384
Billy Three-Sticks.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.427
I thought you were some kind of painter.

15:27.928 --> 15:28.929
Multi-talented.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.433
You see, I was in the band,
and then I wasn't.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.272
I had to walk away. I stumbled, really.

15:38.272 --> 15:41.358
Just-- Our guitar player OD'd, died,

15:41.900 --> 15:43.527
and I didn't want to play without him.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.822
I mean, I couldn't really. So...

15:48.282 --> 15:51.285
I was only slightly less fucked up
than he was.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.036
So I left.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.247
This album is hers?

15:56.206 --> 15:57.583
And she was at this show?

15:58.458 --> 16:03.088
- Wow. This is her, right? Samantha?
- Yeah.

16:03.088 --> 16:07.968
I do not know any Samanthas.
Does she go by something else?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.303
Not that I'm aware.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.722
- Right.
- You know all your fans by name?

16:12.389 --> 16:14.850
Fuck if I wasn't also at this show,

16:14.850 --> 16:18.478
and fuck if I didn't meet this kid
at the club afterwards.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.981
He was doing coke with this guy,
lead singer.

16:21.815 --> 16:27.070
"Lead singer" is a bit of a stretch.
More like a karaoke version of me.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.448
Goes by Nicky Chaos.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.992
This kid, he mentioned that he was--

16:32.618 --> 16:34.161
he was going to go meet someone.

16:34.161 --> 16:38.749
Could have been a Sam or Samantha,
I guess. Honestly, I have no idea.

16:38.749 --> 16:41.001
But he mentioned that she was a writer,

16:41.001 --> 16:43.837
that she wrote something
about me and Nicky.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.963
In here.

16:46.507 --> 16:47.841
We're looking for the kid.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.054
Charles Weisbarger.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.139
Honestly, he may know something,

16:54.139 --> 16:56.475
but didn't really seem
like the murdering type.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.813
You know, I only scanned it so far, but,

17:01.813 --> 17:03.524
she writes about you guys a lot.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.281
Like, don't you think
it's weird that this girl, Samantha,

17:12.281 --> 17:14.201
who is obsessed with me and my band,

17:14.201 --> 17:19.122
gets shot in a park across the street
from my father's house?

17:19.705 --> 17:20.874
And found by your boyfriend.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.542
He wasn't supposed to be at that party.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.463
I don't know exactly
what he said to you, but

17:26.463 --> 17:28.382
he was not invited,

17:28.382 --> 17:32.553
and I was... not expected.

17:32.553 --> 17:37.516
'Cause I haven't talked to my family
in more than 15 years.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.064
It all kind of went to shit
after my mom died.

17:46.567 --> 17:51.613
But obviously,
there is a connection here, right?

17:55.158 --> 17:55.993
You called him?

17:55.993 --> 17:58.287
How'd I know you were gonna be so helpful?

17:59.830 --> 18:01.164
All right.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.209
Go home. Take a shower. Eat something.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.961
I'll deal with your charges.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.131
You think of anything, you call me.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.342
Hey, can I take those?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.219
Yeah, they're copies.

18:15.721 --> 18:18.599
We figure out
who the connection to Samantha is,

18:20.434 --> 18:22.144
we figure out who shot her.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.442
Hey, what's going on?

18:29.610 --> 18:30.736
Come with me.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.747
The L key is missing.

18:42.581 --> 18:43.832
So we should get him a new one?

18:43.832 --> 18:46.627
- Is that what you brought me here for?
- The note. The note from her.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.589
"He is lying to you."
The L was actually a number one.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.132
Are you sure?

18:53.008 --> 18:55.344
Every keystroke
is permanently imprinted on my brain.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.313
She said she didn't write it.
I didn't believe her.

19:08.607 --> 19:09.858
Oh, shit.

19:10.817 --> 19:15.322
He knew about the affair, Keith.
How did Will know about the affair?

19:15.322 --> 19:16.657
I don't know.

19:18.617 --> 19:21.328
I don't know. I was always very discreet.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.496
I tried to be.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.790
We never went anywhere
that anyone would see us.

19:24.790 --> 19:29.294
She never came to the house.
Except, one time.

19:31.672 --> 19:32.673
Stay here.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.717
<i>She came to the apartment once.</i>

19:36.343 --> 19:39.471
Hey. What did I tell you?

19:39.471 --> 19:42.349
What are you gonna do? Punish me?

19:42.349 --> 19:44.768
- Oh, my God, Keith.
- I didn't want her to come up,

19:44.768 --> 19:46.937
but she did, and nothing happened,
and no one was home.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.648
I'm sorry. It's just weird here.

19:49.648 --> 19:53.402
That you knew of. Will is 12.
He has a key!

19:53.402 --> 19:54.528
Explains a lot.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.658
I'm so sorry. I never intended--

19:59.658 --> 20:02.995
- Fuck you and your intentions.
- What do you want me to do?

20:02.995 --> 20:04.830
- You want me to go?
- I want you to die.

20:05.414 --> 20:08.125
- You don't mean that.
- I really do. Except, I need you alive,

20:08.125 --> 20:11.378
because you are the father of my children,
and they love you.

20:12.129 --> 20:13.130
And they're hurting enough.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.386
We're gonna have to crack this thing open
and actually read it.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.930
Well, you're on your own.
I'm not a fan of comic books.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.391
- I never know where I'm supposed to look.
- That's very helpful.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.644
Hey, Detective, got a sec?

20:55.923 --> 20:58.091
<i>Gloria Fan was
somewhere east of Bowery</i>

20:58.091 --> 20:59.801
<i>when the drugs began to take hold.</i>

21:00.928 --> 21:02.846
<i>Street numbers turned to letters,</i>

21:02.846 --> 21:05.807
<i>and the cabs rolling past
were suddenly an exquisite yellow,</i>

21:06.517 --> 21:09.728
<i>their headlights like drops of milk
in the weak tea of the day.</i>

21:11.480 --> 21:13.440
<i>How much of this
was observed by Dirty Paul,</i>

21:13.941 --> 21:17.486
<i>his enormous hands dwarfing the wheel
of his white panel van,</i>

21:17.486 --> 21:21.490
<i>his beefy frame straining the seams
of his Rangers jersey, she couldn't say.</i>

21:22.991 --> 21:25.577
<i>Piper had her head out the window,
as usual.</i>

21:26.203 --> 21:28.664
<i>Like a happy puppy, she shut her eyes
and smiled,</i>

21:29.456 --> 21:31.166
<i>letting the wind blow back her hair.</i>

21:32.960 --> 21:34.503
<i>Iggy was buzzing though.</i>

21:34.503 --> 21:37.297
<i>Knowing him, his ecstasy
was not pharmaceutically induced,</i>

21:37.297 --> 21:39.591
<i>due to rather the exhilaration
of being alive</i>

21:39.591 --> 21:41.009
<i>and doing something naughty.</i>

21:43.720 --> 21:45.264
<i>What can I say about C?</i>

21:46.431 --> 21:50.060
<i>What this human lacks in experience,
he makes up for in enthusiasm.</i>

21:51.103 --> 21:55.315
<i>You can show him a certain building
you like, or a tree even, and for him</i>

21:55.315 --> 21:58.193
<i>it will be the coolest building
or tree he's ever seen.</i>

21:59.319 --> 22:03.740
<i>When you tell him a story, any story,
his face lights up like a girandole.</i>

22:06.201 --> 22:08.912
<i>Today, a rather beautiful preppy
stands on the steps</i>

22:08.912 --> 22:10.539
<i>of Iggy's broke-down palace.</i>

22:11.540 --> 22:13.208
<i>He's come by to deliver a package,</i>

22:13.208 --> 22:16.587
<i>but a twist of fate
has delivered him to me.</i>

22:18.046 --> 22:21.884
<i>When he gives me a ride uptown,
I hover above and look down on myself,</i>

22:21.884 --> 22:25.304
<i>on a life totally different than anything
I ever thought I wanted.</i>

22:25.929 --> 22:28.056
<i>As I scribble my phone number
on his wrist,</i>

22:29.099 --> 22:33.145
<i>I see myself through his eyes,
and I like what I see.</i>

23:04.927 --> 23:06.887
Someone bring me
a whole bunch of thumbtacks!

23:25.781 --> 23:26.740
Hey.

23:27.616 --> 23:28.617
Hi, there.

23:31.453 --> 23:35.916
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.501
Okay.

23:40.921 --> 23:42.339
I thought you liked me.

23:42.339 --> 23:46.510
I mean, I do. You're very likable.

23:47.094 --> 23:50.222
I mean, at this point, I consider you
to be one of my best friends.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.183
I mean, no offense
to Mickey Sullivan, but...

23:53.892 --> 23:56.979
As far as I know, you only have
one other friend, and she's in a coma.

24:12.911 --> 24:17.791
Even if I'm not, technically,
Sam's boyfriend,

24:17.791 --> 24:21.378
and even though I don't know exactly
how she feels about me,

24:21.962 --> 24:27.092
giving my heart or any part of my body
to anybody else

24:27.092 --> 24:29.636
would be like giving up on her.
And I just...

24:31.763 --> 24:33.182
I just can't really do that.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.727
I have to believe
that she's gonna be okay and--

24:36.727 --> 24:39.396
And that I'll find my way back to her, so...

24:42.482 --> 24:43.734
Yeah.

24:50.824 --> 24:51.909
Lorraine.

24:57.331 --> 24:58.498
My real name.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.513
<i>Mayor Michael Bloomberg today...</i>

25:13.347 --> 25:14.848
Tanqueray with...

25:16.850 --> 25:18.018
a twist.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.395
<i>...that the initiative
is partly responsible for the city's...</i>

25:21.730 --> 25:23.315
<i>Coming back to that Bronx fire</i>

25:23.315 --> 25:26.026
<i>we told you about a couple weeks ago.
While investigators first linked...</i>

25:26.026 --> 25:27.194
Nice twist.

25:27.194 --> 25:30.864
<i>...arson that's been sweeping
through the borough in recent months,</i>

25:30.864 --> 25:34.117
<i>today, the NYPD and Homeland Security
reported that</i>

25:34.117 --> 25:38.664
<i>the fire was caused by
an improvised explosive device, or IED.</i>

25:38.664 --> 25:44.711
<i>...has come back negative
for deadly biological or chemical agents,</i>

25:44.711 --> 25:47.339
<i>but DHS say they are not ready
to rule out te--</i>

25:51.635 --> 25:55.180
Okay, so when you found the girl,
there was no one else around, right?

25:55.180 --> 25:56.431
I can't do this anymore.

25:56.431 --> 25:59.685
You weren't curious when it happened to me
and now it's all you talk about.

25:59.685 --> 26:01.770
That was before I knew
she was an Ex Post Facto fan.

26:02.521 --> 26:04.398
I meant this not in a conceited way.

26:04.398 --> 26:06.859
We only sold so many records, right?

26:06.859 --> 26:10.487
And she had one. And she was
at the Ex Nihilo show, she left.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.532
She went to go sit in a park,
across the street from my dad's house,

26:13.532 --> 26:15.868
which is where you found her. Shot.

26:16.869 --> 26:18.495
Maybe Nicky knows the answers to this,

26:18.495 --> 26:20.914
or he'll definitely at least know
the right questions to ask.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.332
How about the questions I have?

26:22.332 --> 26:25.043
Like, how you ended up
arrested for prostitution?

26:25.043 --> 26:27.504
Will you sit still and talk to me?

26:27.504 --> 26:28.881
Mercer.

26:28.881 --> 26:31.049
I'm just trying to work here, okay?

26:31.049 --> 26:34.386
Which is hard enough fucking self-weaning
off heroin. All right?

26:36.305 --> 26:38.682
As long as I have waited for you
to create again,

26:38.682 --> 26:40.225
it will have to wait a little longer.

26:40.809 --> 26:44.188
- I called him.
- There is a car outside with a bag packed.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.856
William, I'm taking you to the airport.

26:45.856 --> 26:49.067
There is a facility in Florida
that has agreed to detox you.

26:49.067 --> 26:52.112
Followed by 28 days of addiction therapy.
So, we leave right now?

26:52.112 --> 26:55.032
- No.
- No. The LIE. The traffic is not good.

26:55.032 --> 26:59.494
I am not going anywhere. I appreciate it.
Okay? I do, but I can't go.

26:59.995 --> 27:01.496
- I have to figure this shit out.
- William,

27:01.496 --> 27:04.249
you cannot figure out addiction
on your own.

27:04.249 --> 27:05.501
I'm not talking about that!

27:05.501 --> 27:07.920
I'm talking about
the girl in the park, all right?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.713
NYPD has no idea what happened to her.

27:09.713 --> 27:11.173
What girl is he talking about?

27:11.173 --> 27:12.883
The girl who was shot in Central Park.

27:12.883 --> 27:16.470
I'm sorry. William is now solving crimes?

27:16.470 --> 27:20.349
No. He's just substituting
one addiction for another.

27:22.434 --> 27:25.145
Mercer, this girl is connected to us.

27:25.145 --> 27:28.941
I don't know how. I don't know why.
But for some reason,

27:29.566 --> 27:32.528
I think I'm the only one
that can figure this shit out. Okay?

27:33.904 --> 27:36.532
- I have to figure this out.
- William, please.

27:36.532 --> 27:38.492
Will you just come with me? The car is--

27:41.328 --> 27:42.538
Mercer.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.127
Can you at least tell me
where you're going?

28:00.639 --> 28:03.684
The best of men
are often the most difficult to love.

28:06.478 --> 28:10.357
I wish this cliché was not true,
but it is.

28:15.821 --> 28:18.407
This is pretty good, SG.
Better than your usual slop.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.535
Hey! My mom's dirty rice. It's amazing.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.370
What happened to Sam's camera?

28:25.789 --> 28:26.790
What?

28:28.500 --> 28:32.379
I was just-- I was thinking. It went
missing sometime before she got shot.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.131
Maybe there's a connection there.

28:35.465 --> 28:37.926
When I asked her about it,
she just got weird, so...

28:38.552 --> 28:40.679
- Weird like how?
- Evasive.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.641
She didn't say much,
or anything at all, really.

28:44.641 --> 28:47.352
It's just that that camera was
like an extension of her body.

28:47.352 --> 28:50.397
She would've looked for it. She would've
asked if you'd seen it, right?

28:50.397 --> 28:53.066
- Did she tell you guys anything about it?
- Nothing.

28:53.984 --> 28:55.944
She just stopped having it around.

28:57.571 --> 29:00.532
Relax, kid. Nicky's all over it.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.535
Actually, we've got a pretty good idea
who did it.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.372
Could ask him right now.

29:08.415 --> 29:12.753
- Yo.
- Nicky, is it true that you, you know?

29:13.504 --> 29:15.005
Sorry, kid. I gotta jet.

29:16.465 --> 29:19.843
- Where you going? Want me to come?
- No. Solo mission.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.888
Don't worry. Shouldn't be long.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.848
- See ya.
- Yeah.

29:28.852 --> 29:32.481
Help me with the dishes, Charlie,
and I'll help you look for Sam's camera.

30:05.764 --> 30:08.433
Mr. Gould. You wanted to see me?

30:08.976 --> 30:09.977
Yes.

30:12.688 --> 30:13.814
Thank you for coming.

30:17.568 --> 30:22.030
Tell me, Nicholas, did you know
that I was orphaned as a child?

30:22.698 --> 30:26.285
No. Never really said
more than a few words to me.

30:26.285 --> 30:29.204
For a child, growing up without parents

30:29.204 --> 30:33.375
is poverty on a different scale.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.920
It gives you a certain amount of...

30:39.631 --> 30:40.674
permission.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.176
Permission to do what?

30:42.176 --> 30:43.510
Whatever it takes.

30:45.387 --> 30:49.433
I want you to understand
how hard I've worked to get where I am.

30:50.017 --> 30:55.355
I'm a man who's created for himself
and his sister the life they yearned for.

30:55.355 --> 30:59.443
And I'm a man
who's not about to let some idiot punk

31:00.444 --> 31:03.280
- jeopardize that life's mission.
- Wait.

31:04.156 --> 31:07.659
- You're talking about the last fire?
- The Department of Homeland Security

31:07.659 --> 31:11.163
- believes there are terrorists on 175th--
- Terrorists?

31:11.163 --> 31:12.497
That's right.

31:12.497 --> 31:15.209
According to my sources
in the New York Fire Department,

31:15.209 --> 31:17.169
that building was blown up with a bomb.

31:18.003 --> 31:19.213
Yeah, a bomb.

31:19.213 --> 31:24.051
- Made from highly dangerous black powder.
- It was very effective.

31:24.635 --> 31:26.553
- It was fucking beautiful.
- Yeah.

31:27.054 --> 31:30.641
- You should've seen the fucking flames--
- It was fucking stupid, is what it was.

31:30.641 --> 31:32.935
You know f-- You said,

31:32.935 --> 31:35.938
"Change it up.
Don't make it all look like one guy."

31:35.938 --> 31:37.856
- And then you f--
- You make bad decisions.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.734
You have very little impulse control.

31:42.194 --> 31:43.362
And we're done.

31:45.364 --> 31:49.243
Yo, but we need that money.
Other people count on me.

31:49.243 --> 31:50.911
You should've thought of that.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.250
Then I'll tell the cops what I know.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.378
About the fires?

32:00.712 --> 32:03.423
- You'd only be indicting yourself.
- No.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.218
About the girl.

32:09.638 --> 32:12.349
Yeah. You know,
the one that got shot in the park.

32:13.976 --> 32:16.019
She was sleeping with your delivery guy.

32:17.187 --> 32:19.106
You couldn't have been happy about that.

32:19.898 --> 32:24.027
- So unhappy that you think I'd shoot her?
- You know, you said it yourself.

32:24.027 --> 32:26.154
You do what it takes.

32:27.239 --> 32:28.532
She was a loose end.

32:29.658 --> 32:30.742
You don't like those.

32:33.245 --> 32:38.292
I assure you, Nicky,
if I shot someone, they'd be dead.

32:50.179 --> 32:53.348
These pins are every address
on Samantha's mailing list.

32:53.348 --> 32:54.433
What do you notice?

32:56.476 --> 32:59.771
They're mostly downtown, Brooklyn.

33:00.772 --> 33:03.817
- One in Long Island. Is that Charlie?
- Leaving what?

33:04.902 --> 33:07.279
This spot right here. Who's that?

33:07.821 --> 33:10.741
That is the address of Keith Lamplighter,

33:10.741 --> 33:13.994
principal of Lamplighter Capital
and Associates.

33:13.994 --> 33:16.663
- Why do I know that name?
- Because our witness, Mercer Goodman,

33:16.663 --> 33:19.917
attended an Independence Day party
thrown by the Hamilton-Sweeneys.

33:19.917 --> 33:24.129
Which he was invited to
by Regan Hamilton-Sweeney Lamplighter,

33:24.129 --> 33:26.381
- Keith's wife.
- Was he at the party?

33:26.381 --> 33:30.886
Invited, but according to
the doorman's log, which we retrieved...

33:32.554 --> 33:34.473
he did not attend.

33:35.057 --> 33:38.393
So, Samantha's favorite band's playing
downtown, right?

33:38.393 --> 33:42.314
But the bouncer at the club says
that she left to go meet someone uptown.

33:42.314 --> 33:45.651
And she goes, and she sits right here,
across the street from the party.

33:45.651 --> 33:47.569
You think she was meeting Lamplighter?

33:48.070 --> 33:49.696
How would she know a guy like that?

33:50.280 --> 33:52.741
The man who came by Samantha's dorm
was older, right?

33:53.242 --> 33:54.243
Seemed rich.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.329
In here, she writes about this preppy guy

33:57.329 --> 33:59.706
who shows up one day
and gives her a ride uptown.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.751
It's the only mention of her
ever going north of 14th Street.

34:07.714 --> 34:10.676
Feast your eyes on this footage
from the dorm.

34:14.137 --> 34:16.806
It's Keith "Preppy Guy" Lamplighter.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.228
- Thank you!
- Sure.

34:23.021 --> 34:25.107
What do you think?
Our body weight in popcorn?

34:25.107 --> 34:27.693
Only if we get sodas
the size of our heads.

34:27.693 --> 34:29.945
Hey, a joke.

34:29.945 --> 34:33.699
That's a good sign.
Like my kid's still in there somewhere.

34:37.077 --> 34:39.454
I still don't understand
what we're doing here.

34:40.581 --> 34:43.542
When you took me out of camp,
I thought something bad happened.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.920
I just want to spend a little
<i>Fast & Furious</i> time with my son.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.840
Sorry, make that <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i>.

34:59.683 --> 35:02.186
Go find us seats. I'll get the stuff.

35:02.895 --> 35:04.271
- The theater's gonna be empty.
- Just go.

35:04.271 --> 35:07.065
You know I have strong opinions
about seat choice. Make me proud.

35:26.001 --> 35:28.587
Guys, I don't want any trouble.

35:31.465 --> 35:32.508
Wait.

35:34.009 --> 35:35.844
Hey! My kid's here!

35:35.844 --> 35:37.304
He's next if you don't shut up.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.225
First, you fucked Sam.

35:42.184 --> 35:43.685
Then you fucked us.

35:46.188 --> 35:47.856
We got fired today.

35:49.107 --> 35:50.609
No way to pay the bills.

35:51.985 --> 35:53.111
Take it.

35:56.114 --> 35:57.115
Thanks.

35:57.866 --> 35:59.660
Oh, fu--

36:11.380 --> 36:12.381
Leave me alone!

36:13.090 --> 36:14.299
Dad?

36:17.261 --> 36:18.387
Hey.

36:21.849 --> 36:22.850
It's okay.

36:26.061 --> 36:27.604
Yeah, well, I can give them a call.

36:28.272 --> 36:29.481
That's no problem.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.275
So, how'd I do?

36:32.734 --> 36:34.528
The fax I intercepted?

36:34.528 --> 36:36.655
Aren't you on this call taking notes?

36:37.239 --> 36:40.284
Bluetooth. Sick, right? The fax.

36:40.284 --> 36:43.161
I forgot. I'm sorry I got distracted.

36:51.628 --> 36:52.754
Hi, I'm here.

37:11.899 --> 37:12.900
Hi, Mathes.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.610
<i>Can you put my dad on the phone?</i>

37:14.610 --> 37:16.612
I'm sorry, Regan,
but now's not a good time.

37:16.612 --> 37:20.782
Mathes, sometimes my voice goes up
at the end of a sentence,

37:20.782 --> 37:22.534
and it's not really a question.

37:22.534 --> 37:24.953
<i>So, put my father on the phone right now.</i>

37:26.288 --> 37:28.540
Sir, it's Regan. Sounds urgent.

37:31.710 --> 37:32.711
Thanks.

37:34.338 --> 37:36.632
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Daddy. How are you?

37:36.632 --> 37:39.510
I'm okay.
Lot of questions from the lawyers.

37:39.510 --> 37:42.596
We'll have lunch tomorrow.
I wanna hear about everything,

37:42.596 --> 37:46.225
but something's come on my radar
that maybe you can explain.

37:46.225 --> 37:47.309
Okay.

37:47.309 --> 37:50.562
I have a memo here
from the mayor's office. It's to Amory.

37:52.022 --> 37:56.735
Apparently,
the Hamilton-Sweeney Group's application

37:56.735 --> 38:00.572
for a Blight Decree
has been suspended pending investigation.

38:01.156 --> 38:02.491
Hold on.

38:09.331 --> 38:10.624
Blight Decree.

38:11.792 --> 38:15.337
That's a dirty-pool tactic used
by thugs and Mafia types

38:15.337 --> 38:18.006
<i>forcing hardworking people
out of their homes,</i>

38:18.006 --> 38:19.758
<i>not paying them what they're worth.</i>

38:19.758 --> 38:24.680
My father refused to ever stoop that low,
and he taught me to follow his example.

38:25.264 --> 38:27.599
That's what I thought. So,

38:29.184 --> 38:32.563
how do we find out more
without asking Amory?

38:32.563 --> 38:35.274
Well, I still have some friends
in Giuliani's office.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.442
Why don't I find out
what we're dealing with?

38:37.442 --> 38:41.864
Bloomberg's the mayor now, Daddy. But yes,
you still have friends everywhere.

38:41.864 --> 38:45.033
I'll send you the fax.
Just stand by the machine

38:45.033 --> 38:47.786
so that Mathes doesn't get
his mitts on it.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.041
Right now.

38:53.041 --> 38:56.211
- Okay. I love you, Daddy. Bye.
- <i>Love you too.</i>

39:00.591 --> 39:02.634
- Hello, officers.
- You got the place bugged?

39:02.634 --> 39:05.179
Or is my suit just that bad?

39:05.888 --> 39:08.182
My assistant is very good at his job.

39:08.182 --> 39:11.560
Listen, I'm happy to walk you
over to our legal department.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.812
They're handling all the inquiries
about my father's case.

39:13.812 --> 39:16.690
We're not here about your dad.
This is about your husband.

39:16.690 --> 39:20.861
Yeah. We actually came to talk to him,
but apparently he's not in today.

39:21.445 --> 39:22.446
I wasn't aware.

39:23.739 --> 39:26.700
- You work in the same building.
- Yeah, but not at the same company.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.745
And plus we're separated.

39:29.745 --> 39:32.998
I'm not fully briefed on his comings
and goings.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.752
You heard about the girl shot
in Central Park?

39:36.752 --> 39:38.921
Yeah, what about her?

39:38.921 --> 39:42.382
The girl self-published the magazine
that your husband subscribed to.

39:43.008 --> 39:46.428
And in it, we think we found a reference
to them meeting. Hitting it off.

39:46.428 --> 39:49.681
- Was your husband with you on July 4th?
- No, like I said, we're separated.

39:49.681 --> 39:53.101
But he was invited
to the party you attended?

39:54.311 --> 39:55.521
Did he show up?

39:56.271 --> 39:59.858
I feel like you're doing that thing
where you ask me questions,

40:00.817 --> 40:02.319
that you already know the answer to.

40:03.111 --> 40:04.279
Guilty as charged.

40:05.656 --> 40:08.742
But let me flip the script and ask you
something I don't already know.

40:08.742 --> 40:09.993
Your separation.

40:10.786 --> 40:12.329
Was infidelity involved?

40:13.038 --> 40:15.082
The girl in the park is a freshman.

40:16.333 --> 40:17.334
You know,

40:17.334 --> 40:19.711
Keith is not perfect, but he would never--

40:19.711 --> 40:21.880
Whose idea was the divorce?

40:22.506 --> 40:24.758
- Mine.
- And how's your ex taking it?

40:24.758 --> 40:27.010
- Not well.
- You keep a gun in the house?

40:27.594 --> 40:31.640
All due respect to our brave brothers
and sisters in blue,

40:31.640 --> 40:35.519
but you cannot be talking
to Ms. Hamilton-Sweeney without a lawyer.

40:35.519 --> 40:39.982
There are about a dozen of them
down the hall. Take your pick.

40:39.982 --> 40:44.736
My niece is far too lovely to be rude,
so allow me. This is very inappropriate.

40:45.737 --> 40:46.905
She seems just fine to me.

40:47.489 --> 40:51.118
Please.
Allow me to show you to the lawyers.

40:52.119 --> 40:54.663
Move on down the hall. I love the suit.

40:54.663 --> 40:55.747
Who are you wearing?

41:07.593 --> 41:09.011
Stu?

41:09.803 --> 41:10.846
Get Keith for me.

41:11.388 --> 41:13.849
Your next meeting's here?
They're waiting in the conference room.

41:15.475 --> 41:18.061
Okay.

41:28.739 --> 41:34.119
Sam loves books. Not just reading,
but like, actual, physical books.

41:34.119 --> 41:37.873
She said she wanted a perfume that smells
like an old edition of Rimbaud.

41:38.916 --> 41:40.250
In fact...

41:45.714 --> 41:46.715
That is pretty good.

41:55.641 --> 41:59.102
There's no camera.
There's nothing in here.

42:02.189 --> 42:03.315
God.

42:07.945 --> 42:09.988
I missed Sam when I was grounded.

42:11.323 --> 42:13.951
And, like, being without her killed me.
But this is just...

42:16.870 --> 42:18.664
This is just so much worse.

42:21.458 --> 42:24.586
Sam kept some stuff in the bathroom.
I'll go check it out.

42:27.130 --> 42:28.131
Okay.

42:33.053 --> 42:35.222
- Yell if you find anything.
- Yeah.

43:16.513 --> 43:20.642
"Eight, three. Eight, three.
Eight, three."

43:21.435 --> 43:22.811
Eighty-three?

43:30.736 --> 43:36.074
"Look behind the horse."

43:40.704 --> 43:42.122
Look behind the horse.

43:43.749 --> 43:46.418
Where's a horse? What's a horse?

44:42.140 --> 44:45.060
Hey, Prophet. Get your ass down here.

44:45.561 --> 44:46.770
Yeah, be right there.

44:55.070 --> 44:56.488
What the fuck is this?

44:58.156 --> 45:01.201
Okay. There's a new plan.

45:01.201 --> 45:03.370
Look, I didn't want to bite the hand
that fed us,

45:03.871 --> 45:05.163
but that hand's become a fist.

45:06.290 --> 45:08.792
It's time to blow it the fuck off.

45:36.987 --> 45:40.073
- Ready when you are, boss.
- Solomon Grungy, you sir,

45:40.073 --> 45:42.743
have outdone yourself.

45:44.620 --> 45:45.746
Where's Charlie?

46:32.501 --> 46:34.920
Hey, bud. We're okay.

46:36.004 --> 46:37.172
They were just muggers.

46:38.423 --> 46:39.675
We're fine.

46:41.635 --> 46:45.681
Cancel the credit cards,
ice this lip. Be like it didn't happen.

46:46.473 --> 46:49.476
It wouldn't have happened if you'd
just gone to work instead of trying

46:49.476 --> 46:51.645
to be the world's greatest dad.

46:53.063 --> 46:55.107
Maybe I was trying
to score some dad points.

46:59.361 --> 47:02.447
Yeah, it's only 'cause
I know I let you down.

47:06.577 --> 47:07.578
Will...

47:18.297 --> 47:23.135
Your mom and I,
we know that you saw something

47:24.511 --> 47:25.971
that you never should have seen.

47:26.471 --> 47:28.473
Me with a young woman here.

47:30.267 --> 47:31.894
I forgot my lacrosse jersey.

47:33.854 --> 47:37.107
Mom told me to put it in my bag
and I said I would, but I didn't.

47:37.816 --> 47:41.195
<i>I came home without telling anyone.
I heard you.</i>

47:54.041 --> 47:55.417
<i>Thanks for telling me.</i>

47:55.417 --> 47:58.962
No one's mad at you.
We're mad at me. I'm mad at myself.

48:00.255 --> 48:04.134
The note you sent. It's okay.
I understand.

48:06.803 --> 48:09.139
I just want to talk about it.

48:10.265 --> 48:11.391
Why did you do it?

48:12.643 --> 48:14.061
Do you not love Mom anymore?

48:14.645 --> 48:15.896
Why did I...

48:17.189 --> 48:19.149
Maybe you'll understand when you're older.

48:19.149 --> 48:20.359
Maybe you never will.

48:21.568 --> 48:22.736
The point is...

48:26.240 --> 48:30.244
I failed you all in a really big way.

48:31.495 --> 48:35.666
In the biggest way possible.
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

48:40.879 --> 48:42.089
It's your mom.

48:46.385 --> 48:50.389
Hey, if camp called about Will,
I signed him out. He's with me.

48:51.014 --> 48:53.267
Two police detectives were here.

48:54.434 --> 48:55.602
Hang on.

48:56.603 --> 48:57.938
<i>Yeah, what about?</i>

48:57.938 --> 48:59.231
You.

49:02.317 --> 49:05.696
The girl in the park,
that was her that you were fucking.

49:07.698 --> 49:08.532
Yeah.

49:10.659 --> 49:12.160
She was a college freshman.

49:12.953 --> 49:14.037
I thought she was older.

49:14.872 --> 49:16.248
Older than what, a child?

49:17.040 --> 49:21.211
- Where were you on July 4th?
- Because you think I shot her?

49:21.211 --> 49:24.047
No, because I hope to God
you have an alibi.

49:24.715 --> 49:25.841
Are you really asking me?

49:25.841 --> 49:28.302
Of course not. I mean,
where would you get a gun?

49:29.511 --> 49:33.265
<i>Keith. Tell me honestly.
Do you think there's a connection?</i>

49:34.725 --> 49:38.478
<i>That girl was standing outside a party
you were supposed to be at.</i>

49:42.274 --> 49:47.237
<i>New York City can feel like a small town,
but that is too big a coincidence.</i>

49:53.869 --> 49:55.954
I think I'm gonna go.

49:57.414 --> 49:59.499
Wait a second. Let me walk you out.

49:59.499 --> 50:01.418
No, don't bother. Someone might see us.

50:01.418 --> 50:04.046
Sam, come on. Wait.

50:27.236 --> 50:28.904
Wait. Will, wait.

50:33.492 --> 50:35.744
Hey, son. Is your dad home?
