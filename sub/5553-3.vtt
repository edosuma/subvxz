WEBVTT

00:02.997 --> 00:04.598
Would you pass
the mustard?

00:04.600 --> 00:05.699
Sure.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.534
Hey, want to hear
a fun fact about mustard?

00:07.536 --> 00:10.437
Is it that the glucosinolates
which give mustard its flavor

00:10.439 --> 00:11.805
were evolved
by the cabbage family

00:11.807 --> 00:14.441
as a chemical defense
against caterpillars?

00:14.443 --> 00:16.076
Yeah.

00:17.445 --> 00:19.246
Well, that was fun.

00:19.248 --> 00:21.381
Good for you, Leonard.

00:21.383 --> 00:22.916
Hey, there.

00:22.918 --> 00:23.917
Hey, you're early.

00:23.919 --> 00:25.652
The movie doesn't start
for an hour.

00:25.654 --> 00:27.287
Actually, we're not
going to the movies.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.956
We are here to kidnap you.

00:29.958 --> 00:31.291
What are you talking about?

00:31.293 --> 00:33.093
Well, you eloped and
we didn't get a chance

00:33.095 --> 00:34.527
to throw you
a bachelor party,

00:34.529 --> 00:36.062
so there's
a van downstairs

00:36.064 --> 00:37.697
and we're here
to take you

00:37.699 --> 00:39.699
to a surprise location
for the weekend.

00:39.701 --> 00:41.868
Well, I'd hardly
call this kidnapping.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.036
Where's the blindfold?

00:43.038 --> 00:44.271
Where's the duct tape?

00:44.273 --> 00:45.839
Where's the part

00:45.841 --> 00:47.574
where you call me
and demand ransom

00:47.576 --> 00:49.075
and I try to keep you
on the phone,

00:49.077 --> 00:51.344
but you hang up
seconds before I can trace it

00:51.346 --> 00:54.714
and then I say, "I'm getting
too old for this crud"?

00:56.884 --> 00:58.952
When do we leave?

00:58.954 --> 00:59.886
Right now.

00:59.888 --> 01:01.254
Yeah, Penny packed
you a bag.

01:01.256 --> 01:02.822
Wow, okay.

01:02.824 --> 01:04.724
You're seriously going to get
in a van and let these two

01:04.726 --> 01:05.992
take you
to an unknown destination

01:05.994 --> 01:07.460
for an entire weekend?

01:07.462 --> 01:09.362
Oh, not just him;
you're coming, too.

01:09.364 --> 01:11.998
Oh, and how do you think you're
going to get me to do that?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.033
Unhand me!

01:13.035 --> 01:14.067
This is ridiculous!

01:14.069 --> 01:15.602
I told you to put tape
on his mouth!

01:15.604 --> 01:17.804
And I told you he bit me!

01:50.739 --> 01:51.883

01:51.885 --> 01:53.285
I don't see why it has to be in

01:53.287 --> 01:55.187
some hippie's
mobile sex dungeon.

01:56.656 --> 01:58.624
Well, Sheldon,
there's something about this van

01:58.626 --> 02:00.726
that you're going to find
very interesting.

02:00.728 --> 02:03.528
It runs on syphilis?

02:05.064 --> 02:08.166
This van was owned
and driven by your personal

02:08.168 --> 02:09.501
physics hero...

02:09.502 --> 02:11.068
Richard Feynman.

02:11.071 --> 02:12.971
No.
Yeah!

02:12.973 --> 02:14.740
A buddy of mine
let me borrow it.

02:14.742 --> 02:16.508
This was Feynman's van?

02:16.510 --> 02:17.676
That's so cool.

02:17.678 --> 02:19.311
Yeah, nothing's been changed
since he drove it.

02:19.313 --> 02:22.014
I bet he picked up a lot of cute
grad students in this bad boy.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.049
Yeah, and talked about physics
with them!

02:26.453 --> 02:28.453
So, are you gonna give us
a clue where we're headed?

02:28.455 --> 02:31.390
Uh, okay, let's see...

02:31.392 --> 02:33.058
They've got spicy food

02:33.060 --> 02:36.061
and there's a chance
you'll get diarrhea.

02:36.063 --> 02:39.398
India.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.533
We can drive there.

02:41.535 --> 02:43.368
Your house?

02:44.937 --> 02:47.539
We are going
to Meh-he-co!

02:47.541 --> 02:48.707
Fun, I've never been there!

02:48.709 --> 02:50.542
Leonard, don't be fooled!

02:50.544 --> 02:51.843
I'm from Texas--

02:51.845 --> 02:55.313
Meh-he-co is Spanish for Mexico.

02:55.315 --> 02:57.215
What's wrong with Mexico?

02:57.217 --> 02:59.885
Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs,

02:59.887 --> 03:03.221
beans that jump around
'cause there's a worm inside.

03:03.223 --> 03:04.856
Okay, calm down.

03:04.858 --> 03:06.124
There's a theme
to this weekend.

03:06.126 --> 03:09.695
We are going to Mexico
in Feynman's van

03:09.697 --> 03:12.164
to stay at the vacation house
Feynman bought

03:12.166 --> 03:14.032
with the money
from his Nobel Prize.

03:14.034 --> 03:15.667
<i>Viva la Imodium!</i>

03:15.669 --> 03:17.202
<i>Ay-ay-ay!</i>

03:20.273 --> 03:22.708
Come on, Leonard's
doing bachelor stuff.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.443
You sure we can't take
you to a strip club?

03:24.445 --> 03:27.145
Nah, if I want to see
a naked dancing man,

03:27.147 --> 03:29.081
I just flush the toilet
while Leonard's in the shower.

03:32.218 --> 03:34.653
Hi.
Hey.

03:34.655 --> 03:36.755
I know we're not making a fuss,

03:36.757 --> 03:39.691
but in the spirit
of bachelorette parties,

03:39.693 --> 03:43.061
I made cookies in the
shape of male genitals.

03:44.130 --> 03:46.031
You really
didn't have to...

03:46.033 --> 03:47.933
Whoa!

03:48.901 --> 03:51.269
That is anatomic.

03:51.271 --> 03:52.437
Thank you.

03:52.439 --> 03:54.406
The veins are gummy worms.

03:57.643 --> 03:59.277
Oh, look,

03:59.279 --> 04:01.980
Jewish and gentile.

04:02.815 --> 04:04.549
I had extra dough.

04:07.521 --> 04:08.687
Oh, that's Leonard.

04:08.689 --> 04:10.088
He said they're about
to cross the border.

04:10.090 --> 04:12.657
I hope the boys don't get
too crazy in Mexico.

04:12.659 --> 04:14.559
Oh, yeah, right.
Lock up your daughters

04:14.561 --> 04:15.894
or Sheldon might
lecture them

04:15.896 --> 04:18.096
about the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

04:19.398 --> 04:22.667
Boy, that was
a long night for me.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.404
Uh-oh.

04:26.406 --> 04:28.807
According to this
Mexican Customs Web site,

04:28.809 --> 04:31.910
visitors may not bring
more than five laser discs,

04:31.912 --> 04:33.812
20 compact discs

04:33.814 --> 04:36.715
or 12 VHS tapes.

04:36.717 --> 04:39.518
We don't have
any of those.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.086
How can you be sure?

04:41.088 --> 04:44.322
VHS was king
when Feynman drove this van.

04:44.324 --> 04:46.291
For all we know,
there are hidden compartments

04:46.293 --> 04:49.127
lousy with Jane Fonda
workout videos.

04:49.129 --> 04:51.329
If there was
a hidden compartment,

04:51.331 --> 04:54.166
don't you think you'd be
stuffed in it by now?

04:55.301 --> 04:58.804
Are we all up to date on our
yellow fever inoculations?

04:58.806 --> 05:02.307
You don't need a yellow fever
shot to go to Mexico.

05:02.309 --> 05:03.775
You can never be too careful.

05:03.777 --> 05:07.012
I got one last year
before I went to Epcot.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.416
So, Penny,
how's married life?

05:11.418 --> 05:12.517
Oh, it's good.

05:12.519 --> 05:14.152
I just wish Leonard
would work up the courage

05:14.154 --> 05:16.721
to tell Sheldon
he's moving in here.

05:16.723 --> 05:18.857
You guys still aren't
living together?

05:18.859 --> 05:20.826
We are. I mean, he sleeps here.

05:20.828 --> 05:22.260
But it's only a matter of time

05:22.262 --> 05:23.595
before Sheldon has a bad dream

05:23.597 --> 05:24.830
and tries to climb into bed

05:24.832 --> 05:27.499
with the Leonard-shaped
pile of pillows.

05:28.367 --> 05:30.135
Speaking of Sheldon,

05:30.137 --> 05:31.369
how's single life treating you?

05:31.371 --> 05:33.171
Fine, I guess.

05:33.173 --> 05:34.739
I've been focusing on me.

05:34.741 --> 05:36.708
I was thinking about
changing my wardrobe.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.810
Yes!
Good for you!

05:39.979 --> 05:42.480
But then I decided I don't want
to go changing who I am

05:42.482 --> 05:43.782
just because of some man.

05:43.784 --> 05:46.651
Yes.
Good for you.

05:47.954 --> 05:49.087
You know, it is normal

05:49.089 --> 05:50.789
to want to change your
look after a breakup.

05:50.791 --> 05:53.625
Actually, I was thinking
of making one small change.

05:53.627 --> 05:54.960
Your sweater?
Your glasses?

05:54.962 --> 05:56.528
Your hair?
Your shoes!

05:56.530 --> 05:58.630
Piercing my ears.

05:58.632 --> 06:00.298
Oh.
Oh.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.766
You really never
had that done?

06:01.768 --> 06:03.235
My mom said pierced ears

06:03.237 --> 06:06.204
were for whores,
pirates and genies.

06:07.406 --> 06:09.875
Okay, well, you're
a grown woman now.

06:09.877 --> 06:12.544
I know, but Sheldon
had this clause

06:12.546 --> 06:13.879
in the Relationship Agreement

06:13.881 --> 06:15.247
forbidding cosmetic surgery

06:15.249 --> 06:17.616
unless it's to look
like a Klingon.

06:19.018 --> 06:20.719
We'll take you to the
mall to get it done.

06:20.721 --> 06:22.287
Why? I can do it
right here.

06:22.289 --> 06:23.321
Really?

06:23.323 --> 06:24.856
You have a piercing gun?
No.

06:24.858 --> 06:26.291
All you need is a needle
and an ice cube.

06:26.293 --> 06:27.626
I've done it, like,
a dozen times.

06:27.628 --> 06:29.194
Oh, I don't know.

06:29.196 --> 06:30.929
Oh, come on.
I'll be gentle.

06:30.931 --> 06:33.098
Let me take your ear virginity.

06:34.634 --> 06:37.469
This party's weird.

06:39.872 --> 06:41.439
Hey, watch your speed.

06:41.441 --> 06:42.974
I hear the Mexican police
target tourists.

06:42.976 --> 06:44.943
Oh, not a problem.

06:44.945 --> 06:46.111
If anything goes down,

06:46.113 --> 06:47.879
we just put Koothrappali
in the driver's seat

06:47.881 --> 06:50.882
and slap a sombrero
on his head.

06:50.884 --> 06:54.686
Dude, how many races can you
offend in a single breath?

06:54.688 --> 06:55.820
I don't know.

06:55.822 --> 06:58.056
Have you watched
the Olympics with me?

06:59.158 --> 07:01.359
Sheldon, can you believe
that we're driving in a van

07:01.361 --> 07:03.361
that was owned by one of
the greatest scientific minds

07:03.363 --> 07:05.096
of the 20th century?

07:05.098 --> 07:06.498
It's like the Batmobile.

07:07.233 --> 07:08.867
If Batman was real

07:08.869 --> 07:10.335
and a physicist

07:10.337 --> 07:13.071
and his car wasn't cool.

07:13.073 --> 07:14.940
It is extraordinary.

07:14.942 --> 07:17.943
Perhaps some of his mojo
will rub off on us.

07:17.945 --> 07:20.345
Maybe between this
and his beach house,

07:20.347 --> 07:22.447
we will be inspired
to greatness.

07:22.449 --> 07:25.583
I usually don't put too much
stock in charms and talismans.

07:25.585 --> 07:27.018
However, even I must admit

07:27.020 --> 07:28.620
feeling Richard Feynman's

07:28.622 --> 07:32.223
butt dent cupping
my own bottom...

07:32.225 --> 07:35.060
that does get
the creative juices flowing.

07:36.429 --> 07:38.096
Hey, I have to return this van.

07:38.098 --> 07:40.532
Keep your creative juices
in your pants.

07:42.235 --> 07:43.301
What was that?

07:43.303 --> 07:44.936
I think it's a tire.

07:44.938 --> 07:47.439
What if it's banditos
shooting at us?

07:47.441 --> 07:48.807
What if we get kidnapped?

07:48.809 --> 07:51.476
What if we end up in a factory
making Bart Simpson piñatas

07:51.478 --> 07:53.745
for the rest of our lives?!

07:53.747 --> 07:55.914
It's the tire.

07:56.782 --> 07:57.916
Leonard?

07:57.918 --> 07:58.950
What?

07:58.952 --> 08:01.519
I am getting too old
for this crud.

08:04.523 --> 08:07.092
Amy, I noticed
your status still says

08:07.094 --> 08:09.527
"in a relationship"
on Facebook.

08:09.529 --> 08:10.962
You're right.

08:10.964 --> 08:13.164
I should probably let
all of my Facebook friends know.

08:13.166 --> 08:16.935
Penny, I'm no longer
in a relationship.

08:18.471 --> 08:20.638
Did you change yours
to "married" yet?

08:20.640 --> 08:22.073
Uh, no, not yet.

08:22.075 --> 08:24.109
There's still a few people
I haven't told personally.

08:24.111 --> 08:25.176
Who?

08:25.178 --> 08:26.678
Oh, just my parents

08:26.680 --> 08:28.179
and my entire family.

08:28.181 --> 08:29.948
What?

08:29.950 --> 08:31.016
Why?

08:31.018 --> 08:32.450
Well, I don't want
to hurt my dad.

08:32.452 --> 08:33.650
You know, he always wanted

08:33.653 --> 08:35.320
to dance with his daughter
at her wedding.

08:35.322 --> 08:36.855
What about
your sister's wedding?

08:36.857 --> 08:39.823
They started to,
then her water broke.

08:40.993 --> 08:42.894
You know, if he finds out
we eloped,

08:42.895 --> 08:44.062
it's gonna break his heart.

08:44.063 --> 08:45.897
How long do you think
you can keep it from him?

08:45.899 --> 08:48.733
Yeah, isn't it gonna get
worse the longer you wait?

08:48.735 --> 08:50.268
Well, not necessarily.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.103
You know,
Dad's not getting any younger,

08:52.105 --> 08:53.705
so if I wait long enough,

08:53.707 --> 08:55.473
I'll just tell him
he walked me down the aisle

08:55.475 --> 08:57.008
and it was magical.

09:02.148 --> 09:04.315
When did you learn
how to change a tire?

09:04.317 --> 09:06.684
Every self-respecting gentleman
should know how

09:06.686 --> 09:08.987
in case he comes across
a damsel in distress

09:08.989 --> 09:10.488
by the side of the road.

09:11.824 --> 09:12.991
If I see one scorpion,

09:12.993 --> 09:14.359
I am getting
on someone's shoulders

09:14.361 --> 09:16.394
and never coming down.

09:16.396 --> 09:18.630
And there's your damsel.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.333
Wow, this one's really stuck.

09:22.335 --> 09:23.968
Are you turning
it the right way?

09:23.970 --> 09:25.537
No.

09:25.539 --> 09:26.805
I took the other four off

09:26.807 --> 09:28.339
and when I got to this one,
I thought,

09:28.341 --> 09:30.208
"You know, I'm in a rut.
Let's shake things up."

09:30.210 --> 09:32.077
Here, let me try.

09:38.551 --> 09:41.319
You're right, it doesn't turn
the other way.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.074

09:52.259 --> 09:53.761
There you go.

09:53.762 --> 09:54.727
You're all done!

09:54.729 --> 09:56.162
That wasn't so bad.

09:57.465 --> 09:59.065
Nice.

09:59.067 --> 10:01.067
Boy, if my mom could see me now,

10:01.069 --> 10:03.670
she'd lock me in the sin closet.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.173
That's a joke, right?

10:07.175 --> 10:08.875
Actually, the joke was on her.

10:08.877 --> 10:10.977
I could still see the TV
through the slats.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.546
I'm starting to see

10:13.548 --> 10:15.615
why you and your mom
aren't very close.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.517
Bet she'd still tell her

10:17.519 --> 10:18.618
if she got married.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.587
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

10:20.589 --> 10:22.522
Well, it's kind of sad
that they don't know.

10:22.524 --> 10:24.157
I mean, they love Leonard.

10:24.159 --> 10:25.425
Fine, you want
me to call?

10:25.427 --> 10:26.559
I'll call.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.696
Why am I so nervous?

10:29.698 --> 10:30.964
It's understandable.

10:30.966 --> 10:33.700
Amy was afraid to tell her mom
she broke up with Sheldon.

10:33.702 --> 10:34.868
Yeah?
How did it go?

10:34.870 --> 10:36.135
Did she make you crawl

10:36.137 --> 10:37.670
into the breaking-up drawer?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.907
Uh, well, actually,
to be honest...

10:40.909 --> 10:42.467
I-I haven't told her yet.

10:42.468 --> 10:44.235
You've been giving me
a hard time

10:44.236 --> 10:46.203
and you haven't even told
your mom about Sheldon?

10:46.573 --> 10:48.372
I'm feeling a little dizzy
from all the blood loss.

10:48.373 --> 10:50.006
I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:52.076 --> 10:53.810
Fine. I'm calling home,

10:53.812 --> 10:55.312
but when I'm done,
you're calling your mother.

10:55.314 --> 10:57.447
Easy for you to say.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.749
You never had to watch
<i>60 Minutes</i> like this.

11:02.353 --> 11:03.520
Hey, Daddy.

11:03.522 --> 11:04.788
Hey, slugger.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.189
How's my girl?

11:06.191 --> 11:07.824
Uh, good. Is Mom around?

11:07.826 --> 11:09.926
Ah, she took your brother out
to celebrate.

11:09.928 --> 11:12.796
He just got his tenth
one-month sober chip.

11:13.998 --> 11:17.767
Yeah, she's gonna make him
a little necklace.

11:17.769 --> 11:19.236
Okay, I'll talk to her later.

11:19.238 --> 11:21.071
Uh, Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.

11:21.706 --> 11:24.207
Leonard and I got married.

11:24.209 --> 11:25.375
You did?

11:25.377 --> 11:26.710
When?

11:26.712 --> 11:28.378
Last week. I'm sorry,
I should've told you.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.746
It was a spur
of the moment thing.

11:29.748 --> 11:30.981
I feel terrible.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.349
Please don't be
too disappointed.

11:32.351 --> 11:34.551
Are you happy?

11:34.553 --> 11:35.552
Very.

11:35.554 --> 11:36.853
Leonard is so great.

11:36.855 --> 11:38.688
Well, then I'm happy for you.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.890
Aw, thank you, Daddy.

11:40.892 --> 11:41.958
That means so much.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.260
Well, I understand it's hard

11:43.262 --> 11:44.494
to tell someone something

11:44.496 --> 11:46.429
if you think
it's gonna upset 'em.

11:46.431 --> 11:47.664
It is.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.065
You're the best dad ever.

11:49.067 --> 11:52.569
Yeah. Uh, hold that thought.

11:52.571 --> 11:54.904
I've been sitting
on a little news myself.

11:54.906 --> 11:56.539
Well, what is it?

11:56.541 --> 11:59.709
You know that rototiller
I got for the tractor?

11:59.711 --> 12:00.777
No.

12:00.779 --> 12:01.811
Oh, you should see it.

12:01.813 --> 12:04.481
It is a beautiful
piece of machinery.

12:04.483 --> 12:07.217
Anyway, uh...

12:07.219 --> 12:10.186
I backed over
your pet pig with it.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.689
Moondance?

12:12.691 --> 12:15.925
Yeah, he's, uh,
not dancing anymore.

12:15.927 --> 12:17.894
You killed my pig?

12:18.929 --> 12:20.130
I did not kill him.

12:20.132 --> 12:22.465
The vet took care of that.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.200
When?

12:24.202 --> 12:27.270
Oh... ten, 12 months ago.

12:28.606 --> 12:29.973
You didn't tell me for a year?!

12:29.975 --> 12:32.442
Well, apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

12:33.477 --> 12:34.644
Love ya, slugger.

12:34.646 --> 12:36.313
Gotta go!

12:38.749 --> 12:40.950
Okay, Amy, your turn.

12:50.494 --> 12:52.662
What are you doing?

12:52.664 --> 12:54.631
It's called Lamaze breathing.

12:54.633 --> 12:57.267
It helps you push.

12:58.102 --> 12:59.369
Great.

12:59.371 --> 13:00.770
He's pushing
with his uterus.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.909
There's got to be a smarter way
of removing it.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.677
Yeah, this is nothing more
than a physics problem.

13:07.679 --> 13:08.945
Right.

13:08.947 --> 13:10.714
Archimedes once said,

13:10.716 --> 13:11.981
"Give me a 'leever' long enough

13:11.983 --> 13:13.483
"and a fulcrum
on which to place it,

13:13.485 --> 13:14.818
and I shall move the world."

13:14.820 --> 13:16.519
Of course.

13:16.521 --> 13:18.221
All we need is to find stuff

13:18.223 --> 13:20.724
to make a "leever" big
enough to fix this.

13:20.726 --> 13:21.958
Exactly.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.126
I'll bet there's
something around here

13:23.128 --> 13:24.728
that could
be a "lehver."

13:24.730 --> 13:27.163
Let's see, a "lehver,"
a "lehver"...

13:27.165 --> 13:28.565
Everybody hold on!

13:28.567 --> 13:30.300
Let's take this problem
one step at a time.

13:30.302 --> 13:31.968
First, we need to decide

13:31.970 --> 13:34.270
whether we're calling it
leever or lehver.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.174
And the sooner
we decide it's leever,

13:38.176 --> 13:41.044
the sooner we can roll up
our sleeves-- not slehves--

13:41.046 --> 13:42.712
and get to work.

13:42.714 --> 13:44.614
We're gonna be here
"foreever."

13:48.285 --> 13:49.719
Thanks a lot, guys.

13:49.721 --> 13:50.787
What did we do?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.055
Before I made that call,

13:52.057 --> 13:53.356
my pig was alive and happy

13:53.358 --> 13:54.691
and rolling around in the mud.

13:54.693 --> 13:57.060
Now he's illegally buried
in our backyard

13:57.062 --> 13:59.362
next to my great-grandmother.

13:59.364 --> 14:01.598
Really?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.501
They didn't eat him?

14:04.503 --> 14:06.369
No.

14:06.371 --> 14:09.038
He was a beloved member
of the family.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.108
The breakfast meat family?

14:13.878 --> 14:15.311
It's not funny.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.780
You're up.
Call your mother.

14:16.782 --> 14:18.281
Oh, maybe later.

14:18.283 --> 14:21.017
Your pig dying
made me sad.

14:21.019 --> 14:23.019
And a little hungry.

14:23.021 --> 14:24.521
Phone, now.

14:24.523 --> 14:26.222
Okay. Okay.

14:26.224 --> 14:27.857
Fine.

14:30.628 --> 14:31.995
Hi, Mom.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.329
Try dialing.

14:35.032 --> 14:36.866
You saw that, huh?

14:40.771 --> 14:43.139
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

14:44.375 --> 14:45.608
Oh, good.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.243
How's work?

14:47.245 --> 14:48.211
That's nice.

14:48.213 --> 14:49.612
I'm fine.

14:49.614 --> 14:51.748
Hey, listen,
I've been meaning to ask,

14:51.750 --> 14:55.151
how come Aunt Doe and
Aunt Florence never got along?

14:55.153 --> 14:56.519
Okay, just...
give me that.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.021
Amy broke up with Sheldon,

14:58.023 --> 14:59.088
she got her ears pierced

14:59.090 --> 15:01.658
and she made us
eat penis cookies!

15:04.728 --> 15:05.962
Hang on.

15:05.964 --> 15:07.997
She wants to talk to you.

15:12.236 --> 15:14.137
I don't think
the lever's working.

15:14.139 --> 15:15.705
What makes you say that?

15:20.678 --> 15:23.413
There's gotta be
something else we could try.

15:23.415 --> 15:25.348
If this was <i>Star</i> <i>Trek,</i>

15:25.350 --> 15:27.517
we could use a phaser
to blast it off.

15:27.519 --> 15:29.385
No, it's too
broad of a beam.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.987
You'd need something
more precise,

15:30.989 --> 15:32.989
like Superman's heat vision.

15:32.991 --> 15:34.324
Ooh, the Green
Lantern's ring

15:34.326 --> 15:36.426
could make a big green
hand that unscrews it.

15:36.428 --> 15:37.961
If you need
a green hand,

15:37.963 --> 15:39.229
why not just
use the Hulk?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.797
Oh, please, the Hulk
would never get

15:40.799 --> 15:42.999
across the border
with that temper.

15:43.001 --> 15:44.601
Guys, excuse me,

15:44.603 --> 15:46.569
not that calling
one of the Avengers

15:46.571 --> 15:48.805
isn't a perfectly
reasonable choice,

15:48.807 --> 15:49.939
but we're
scientists.

15:49.941 --> 15:51.608
Don't you think we
can figure this out

15:51.610 --> 15:52.976
using actual science?

15:52.978 --> 15:55.011
Yes, we could
use science.

15:55.013 --> 15:56.279
But it's your
bachelor party.

15:56.281 --> 15:57.680

Sometimes it's a curse.

16:48.198 --> 16:50.233
I had no idea

16:50.235 --> 16:51.935
tortilla chips were
such a good fuel source.

16:51.937 --> 16:55.838
They're basically pure
hydrocarbons soaked in fat.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.807
Let's hope the lug nut expands.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.043
What if that burning
food attracts animals?

17:00.045 --> 17:02.178
We have plenty of food
for the animals.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.546
- We do?
- Yep.

17:03.548 --> 17:06.249
A six-foot wiener
in a Flash T-shirt.

17:06.251 --> 17:08.685
That's not very nice.

17:08.686 --> 17:10.553
It's a bachelor party.
Lighten up.

17:15.593 --> 17:18.595
What is that awful smell?

17:18.597 --> 17:19.829
It's burning salsa.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.564
I'm hoping the acidity
and salinity

17:21.566 --> 17:23.633
combined with electricity
will corrode the lug nut off.

17:23.635 --> 17:26.169
What an innovative solution.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.606
Perhaps I don't give your
MIT education enough credit.

17:29.608 --> 17:32.075
Yeah, I saw it on <i>Mythbusters.</i>

17:37.314 --> 17:40.049
All right, this rust,

17:40.051 --> 17:42.852
combined with the aluminum
recovered from the van,

17:42.854 --> 17:44.454
is now thermite.

17:44.456 --> 17:45.455
Great.

17:45.457 --> 17:47.590
Couple pinches
ought to do the trick.

17:47.592 --> 17:49.559
Is that enough
to melt the lug nut?

17:49.561 --> 17:50.526
Well, let's start small.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.561
We can always add more.

17:51.563 --> 17:54.497
You put up a good fight,
lug nut,

17:54.499 --> 17:58.201
but you've met your match.

18:15.586 --> 18:16.819
Hey, look!

18:16.821 --> 18:19.522
The lug nut's off.

18:36.705 --> 18:38.172
What...

18:38.174 --> 18:40.307
What are you
doing back?

18:42.444 --> 18:43.844
We got a flat

18:43.846 --> 18:45.145
and couldn't get
the tire off.

18:45.147 --> 18:46.980
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:46.982 --> 18:48.315
Thank you.

18:48.317 --> 18:49.783
If it makes you feel any better,

18:49.785 --> 18:51.085
I pierced Amy's ears

18:51.087 --> 18:53.854
and her mom made her sit
in my closet.

18:58.159 --> 18:59.693
We blew up Feynman's van.

18:59.695 --> 19:02.262
My dad killed my pig
with his tractor.

19:02.264 --> 19:04.698
I spent the night
in Mexico with Sheldon.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.033
You win.
