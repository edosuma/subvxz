00:19.452 --> 00:21.887
Dads <i>is recorded in front of</i>
<i>a live studio audience.</i>

00:23.356 --> 00:25.357
(sighs)

00:25.359 --> 00:27.192
Dad, I know how much
that excites your nipples,

00:27.194 --> 00:29.528
but please get
out of my way.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.298
I need the light; I was
reading the newspaper.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.200
What?
Get out of here.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.003
You are in my way
every morning.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.638
You're in <i>my</i> way every morning.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.473
I have to work,
you have nothing.
I do stuff.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.409
Ask Edna.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.576
He do nothing.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.847
Get out of the house.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.216
It's San Francisco;
there's so much to see.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.251
You can go to Alcatraz.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.485
I don't need to see a prison.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.088
I was married to your mother.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.090
See the trolley cars.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.726
No, thanks, I'm straight.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.394
Chinatown?

01:02.396 --> 01:06.065
All Chinatowns look alike to me.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.666
Whatever, Dad,
you can't keep doing this.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.734
I'm gonna be late for work.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.936
You work two floors down.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.405
Yeah, but I still have to eat
and then I have to shower.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.180
Okay, you good to go.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.286
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:27.288 --> 01:29.254
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:29.256 --> 01:33.358
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

01:33.360 --> 01:35.461
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

01:35.463 --> 01:39.698
¶ So many stars up in the sky

01:39.700 --> 01:44.269
¶ So many questions have I

01:44.271 --> 01:46.138
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:46.140 --> 01:50.042
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

01:51.911 --> 01:55.214
Look, I-I know you're
really upset that Eli ended

01:55.216 --> 01:57.449
the relationship,
but I can assure you,

01:57.451 --> 02:00.085
he-he had the best intentions.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.720
Where is that coward?

02:01.722 --> 02:03.489
WARNER:
Well, see, I'm here

02:03.491 --> 02:05.090
to break up with you for him,

02:05.092 --> 02:07.326
so if there's anything
you want to say to him,

02:07.328 --> 02:09.161
you can say to me.

02:09.163 --> 02:12.397
Hmm, well said.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.066
Anything else?

02:16.569 --> 02:18.137
I think I've heard enough.

02:18.139 --> 02:21.306
Uh, here's a-- whoo--
generous severance check

02:21.308 --> 02:22.774
and a free

02:22.776 --> 02:25.744
Ghost Child Games T-shirt
for you.

02:29.949 --> 02:33.118
Eli, you've got to stop
banging our assistants.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.187
She could sue us
and we'd all be done.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.990
Um, I could sue her sweater
for misrepresenting her boobs,

02:37.992 --> 02:39.825
and I'd win.

02:41.127 --> 02:42.327
And then I would make
a triumphant speech

02:42.329 --> 02:44.029
on the courthouse steps.

02:44.031 --> 02:48.367
"Today is a great day for
honest boobs everywhere."

02:48.369 --> 02:51.170
(imitating echo):
Everywhere, everywhere.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.338
Eli, this isn't funny.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.706
People are saying
that you're sexist.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.808
Yeah, but they're all
women, so who cares?

02:56.810 --> 03:00.712
No, we had to hire
a new HR lady because of you.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.814
Trust me, you do not want
to deal with the new HR woman.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.216
She is mean.

03:04.218 --> 03:07.786
She fired Dick
just for introducing himself.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.557
This girl today
wasn't my fault.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.659
She was so annoying.
How?

03:13.661 --> 03:15.794
She would describe her
dreams to me every morning.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.196
Oh, God, I hate it
when my wife does that.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.197
Right?
Yeah, it's awful.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.364
Yeah.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.365
I mean, do you do that?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.366
Asians don't dream.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.369
It's a waste of time.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.539
I think Martin Luther King
would disagree with you.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.309
Am I right?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.047
And you were there,
too, but it wasn't

03:35.049 --> 03:37.749
really you, and we were falling
and we tried to scream,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.351
but nothing was coming out.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.752
That's weird, huh?

03:40.754 --> 03:44.690
Hmm, that's so interesting
and special.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.692
Thank you, guys,
for having me over.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.427
I really couldn't
stand another night

03:48.429 --> 03:52.364
of watching Cinemax with my
dad with our legs touching.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.366
You know, Crawford, I bet

03:54.368 --> 03:56.401
you and David have
a lot in common.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.670
Maybe you should hang out
tomorrow.

03:58.672 --> 04:02.407
I'd love to;
let me check my day planner.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.444
Uh, Dad, that says "1982."

04:05.446 --> 04:07.346
The days line up the same.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.449
Well, you know what?

04:10.451 --> 04:11.717
I have an opening

04:11.719 --> 04:16.288
between 8:00 a.m.
and 4:00 p.m.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.124
Who is Jane Pauley?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.393
Oh, that was '82,
and you may not know this,

04:21.395 --> 04:23.462
but your old man was
quite the stalker.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.364
(chuckles)

04:35.808 --> 04:37.809
Psst.

04:37.811 --> 04:41.280
Psst, psst, psst.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.382
What is that?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.050
That's our new assistant
Janet.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.551
Are you kidding?

04:46.553 --> 04:49.821
She looks like the old lady
on that pasta sauce label.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.425
Exactly--
Janet is Eli-proof.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.559
Oh, oh, really?
Yeah.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.328
Oh, we'll see about that.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.330
Okay.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.838
I hit a 1970s perfume wall.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.540
Yeah.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.410
Why would you
do this to me?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.645
Because you are
a human resources nightmare.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.514
Eli, this company
can't afford to get sued,

05:15.516 --> 05:18.750
and trust me, you want
no part of the new HR lady.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.486
She hit three home runs
in softball yesterday.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.121
One of them was
to dead center.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.423
Really?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.425
Yeah, it hit a car.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.672
My God!

05:40.674 --> 05:44.009
That coffee is,
like, 180 degrees!

05:44.011 --> 05:45.944
She didn't even
blow on it.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.680
(grunts, sighs)

05:51.517 --> 05:53.685
Hey, Jesus
of Nazareth.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.990
In this office...

05:58.992 --> 06:01.360
we wear socks.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.530
For God's sakes,
get some socks, you maniac.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.367
You're gonna get us all killed!

06:08.369 --> 06:10.168
Oh, hey, what are
you guys doing here?

06:10.170 --> 06:11.403
I thought you guys were going
out to lunch.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.138
We are out for lunch.
Where's your fridge?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.406
Um...

06:15.375 --> 06:18.043
I, uh, I can get lunch
for your friends.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.044
Uh, these aren't friends.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.545
They're dads.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.513
Oh.

06:21.515 --> 06:25.517
Oh, well, hello,
Mr. Sachs, and hi.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.551
Call me David.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.053
Mr. Sachs is my son's name.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.423
(laughing)

06:35.828 --> 06:39.464
Boy, I wish I had a swing
like that on my front porch.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.369
Yeah, she looks
like that beautiful woman

06:44.371 --> 06:47.572
on the pasta sauce label.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.444
Come on, Crawford,
be my wingman.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.745
(laughs)

06:54.680 --> 06:56.681
(laughs)
Oh, my God,

06:56.683 --> 06:58.917
my dad's trying to impress her
with a two-dollar bill.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.420
I can't believe this--
I hired Janet

07:01.422 --> 07:03.422
so nobody would be
attracted to her.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.525
Well, it looks like a couple of
nobodies are attracted to her.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.528
Okay, if she feels
sexually pressured

07:09.530 --> 07:12.531
by her bosses' fathers,
that's a form of harassment.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.299
Yeah, but if my dad
starts dating her,

07:14.301 --> 07:15.700
then he'll be
out of the house,

07:15.702 --> 07:18.103
and that is a form
of happiness.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.473
Come on, Dad,
work your magic.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.574
So, why aren't you married?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.042
Bum vagina?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.544
(laughing)

07:30.983 --> 07:32.317
NEWS ANCHOR:
<i>Coming up,</i>
<i>why today's 65-year-old</i>

07:32.319 --> 07:33.618
is livelier than ever.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.388
Aw, geez.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.563
(gasps)

07:46.732 --> 07:49.801
No smoking in my house.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.636
Boy, must have dozed off there.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.305
(chuckles)

07:53.307 --> 07:56.575
You know, there's nothing
like a cigar and a nap.

07:56.577 --> 08:00.011
Yeah, so, any plans tonight?

08:00.013 --> 08:03.014
Yeah, I got three people
coming over to teach me Yiddish.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.884
I got to go make a yarmulke
out of a coffee filter.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.688
Hey.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.490
Hey, how was work?

08:11.492 --> 08:13.492
Bad. How was home?
Bad.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.594
Well, should we talk
about it or just drink?

08:15.596 --> 08:16.628
We should
probably talk.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.530
All right, I'll make
the drinks.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.100
I know you're against
office romances,

08:22.102 --> 08:25.670
but your dad really seems
to like this Janet,

08:25.672 --> 08:28.940
and I think that you should
encourage him to find love

08:28.942 --> 08:30.709
and get him
out of my house.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.710
(snickers)

08:31.712 --> 08:34.279
<i>Your</i> house?

08:34.281 --> 08:35.480
What?
Oh, nothing.

08:35.482 --> 08:36.948
Oh, come on, he's not that bad.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.550
Warner.
Yeah.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.685
Do you have
black neighbors?

08:40.687 --> 08:43.188
Uh, yeah, Dad,
right next door.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.524
Oh...

08:45.526 --> 08:46.791
(sighs)

08:46.793 --> 08:48.727
I'm sorry, Officer,
the whole thing

08:48.729 --> 08:50.729
is just a humorous
misunderstanding.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.398
Mm-hmm.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.734
So, did Janet ask
about me?

08:55.736 --> 08:56.668
No, she didn't,

08:56.670 --> 08:58.570
and you're not
going to have

08:58.572 --> 09:00.138
an office romance, I'm sorry.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.207
Well, not with that
Casanova David around.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.644
He's got so many cool shirts.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.646
I hate my shirts.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.747
(knocking)

09:08.749 --> 09:11.383
Oh, that must
be my Jews.

09:18.090 --> 09:21.293
Who the hell called
the cops on me?

09:24.997 --> 09:28.166
So they removed the body,
and suddenly I had a seat

09:28.168 --> 09:31.002
in first class.
(gasps)

09:31.004 --> 09:34.739
God, he has no game.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.374
It's a wonder
you were ever born.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.578
Hmm... and yet
here I stand.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.614
Oh, are you standing?

09:42.616 --> 09:45.050
Would you like to go
out for dinner?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.851
I know a Greek place
around the corner.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.621
Oh, well, I-I love Greek food.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.589
And corners.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.057
(laughs)

09:52.059 --> 09:54.593
Uh, want to pick me up at 6:00?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.094
No, I'll meet you there.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.767
Oh, look at her.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.269
She's so beautiful.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.370
Now, listen,

10:05.372 --> 10:06.571
go over there
and talk to her.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.772
Okay.
Be yourself.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.641
Be myself.
Yes.

10:09.643 --> 10:10.609
How's my breath?

10:10.611 --> 10:13.812
(exhales)

10:13.814 --> 10:16.047
It's age-appropriate.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.117
Yeah.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.620
Oh, hey,
what are you doing...?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.421
Oh, my God, you're not
pregnant again, are you?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.156
(mouths)

10:25.158 --> 10:26.891
Oh, no, no, come on.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.627
We talked about this.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.661
You're trying to set my dad up?

10:29.663 --> 10:31.096
Well,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.064
she said yes.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.900
Now I got to get to work
on an erection.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.838
How come
the only kind of kebab

10:39.840 --> 10:42.641
you ever hear about
is shish?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.646
Oh, look, it's a ladybug.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.748
All right, hold
still, I'll kill it.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.554
Anyone who owns their own
bowling ball is a schmuck.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.026
The first person who comes up
with a use for men's nipples--

11:01.028 --> 11:04.295
they can write
their own ticket.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.432
I didn't like that no-leg
South African sprinter

11:07.434 --> 11:10.368
<i>before</i> he shot
his girlfriend.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.372
BOTH:
Separate checks.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.543
VERONICA:
<i>So, Janet,</i>

11:18.545 --> 11:19.811
what is your decision?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.880
Whose dandruff
do you want on you?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.948
(laughs)

11:23.950 --> 11:25.817
Well, that-that's...

11:25.819 --> 11:29.054
that's a really
tough choice, but

11:29.056 --> 11:30.488
I think I...

11:30.490 --> 11:31.956
I clicked a little
more with...

11:31.958 --> 11:33.224
David.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.225
Yes!

11:34.227 --> 11:35.160
Oh, he's just so dark.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.795
Yes, he is!

11:37.897 --> 11:39.864
I-I'll send a moving
truck with all his stuff,

11:39.866 --> 11:41.733
and then, I'll, what,
see you at Thanksgiving?

11:41.735 --> 11:42.901
(laughs)

11:42.903 --> 11:44.969
Hold on, hold on.
Janet,

11:44.971 --> 11:46.504
as our employee,

11:46.506 --> 11:48.373
if this in any way makes you
feel uncomfortable,

11:48.375 --> 11:49.874
you don't have to date him.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.342
Oh, I...
Okay. No.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.245
I think the whole... the whole
office should hear this.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.715
Guys, listen up, okay?

11:56.717 --> 11:59.250
Everyone in this office

11:59.252 --> 12:01.720
is captain
of their own sexual freedom.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.923
Be you straight, gay...

12:04.925 --> 12:07.425
or Elliot.

12:08.694 --> 12:09.728
Okay?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.696
You don't need to have sex

12:11.698 --> 12:14.699
with the bosses' fathers,
or anyone.

12:14.701 --> 12:18.603
But you can.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.205
Okay, but don't.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.573
Choose happiness!

12:21.575 --> 12:22.574
Not at work.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.775
Heart wants what it wants.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.776
And that's why there are laws,

12:24.778 --> 12:25.844
right, guys?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.812
Hello? What happened?

12:29.515 --> 12:32.817
You shouldn't have started
your speech at 4:59.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.758
Mountaintop wizard fight?

12:39.760 --> 12:40.759
Fireball, fireball.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.627
Lightning!
Ash naz gimbatu!

12:42.629 --> 12:45.263
Ash naz gimbatu!

12:52.138 --> 12:53.605
Hey.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.740
Hey! How was work?

12:55.742 --> 12:57.041
Well, you'd be proud of me.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.643
I peed at the urinal

12:58.645 --> 13:01.646
with some guy standing
right next to me. (laughs)

13:01.648 --> 13:04.048
Did anything come out?

13:04.050 --> 13:06.251
No, but I stood there
like it was.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.952
Mm.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.455
It's all gonna happen soon,
I can feel it.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.892
Warner, you want
this condom?

13:16.061 --> 13:17.428
I'm never gonna use it.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.063
Uh, Dad,
where'd you get that?

13:19.065 --> 13:21.399
From your neighbor.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.836
It's a large.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.811
Dad, you know, forget about
that whole Janet thing.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.245
Well...

13:34.247 --> 13:37.248
Workplace romances
are always a disaster.

13:37.250 --> 13:41.252
You know, Warner, this whole
thing has made me realize...

13:41.254 --> 13:44.923
that there's really only
one person out there for you.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.293
For me... it was your mother.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.161
And for your mother,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.564
it was a weightlifter
from Sacramento.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.836
I had no idea he felt like that.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.970
Yeah.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.873
You know, when I was a kid,

14:01.875 --> 14:05.043
I asked Jenny Sanders
to the prom, and she said no.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.646
And-and my dad got in the car
and drove all the way down there

14:08.648 --> 14:10.815
and convinced her to go with me.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.817
That's sweet.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.720
And creepy.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.856
I can't believe
I'm going to say this,

14:17.858 --> 14:19.858
but I'm going
to go down to Janet's

14:19.860 --> 14:21.659
and get my dad a prom date.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.061
Oh, while you're out, can you
pick me up some of...?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.730
No. This is not
one of those trips.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.804
(doorbell rings)

14:42.081 --> 14:44.382
Janet?

15:05.938 --> 15:08.172
(screaming)

15:08.174 --> 15:09.908
(screaming)

15:19.084 --> 15:20.952
Hey.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.087
Good morning.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.323
That's right.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.296
Oh, I forgot
what I was gonna say.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.098
Oh, yeah. Is Janet here?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.967
Oh, she, uh, quit this morning.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.604
Oh...

15:39.606 --> 15:42.974
Okay. Just, like...

15:42.976 --> 15:45.109
Just like that?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.812
Mm?
Yeah.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.116
She said she really
enjoyed her time here,

15:52.118 --> 15:54.485
and she just wanted
to pursue other opportunities.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.121
Okay. Okay.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.058
Uh, that's good for her, right?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.794
Ah. That's all she said?

16:02.796 --> 16:03.928
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.964
Okay. Okay.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.571
Oh, and something about you
leering through a window

16:13.573 --> 16:17.675
of her house, yelling,
"I'm not masturbating!"

16:29.455 --> 16:31.255
I can explain. I...

16:31.257 --> 16:33.458
Don't waste it on us.
Okay...

16:33.460 --> 16:36.361
Save it for HR, because
you have a meeting at 11:00.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.830
Aw, who's a little
HR nightmare now?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.198
It's you.
No.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.000
It's you.
No.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.035
Who's the little
HR nightmare?
No.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.737
Isn't it you?
No.

16:46.872 --> 16:48.806
Uh...

16:48.808 --> 16:50.341
Okay, what do I do?
What do I do?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.543
Relax. I will go upstairs,
I'll talk to my dad,

16:52.545 --> 16:54.779
he'll call Janet, and
she'll drop the whole thing.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.014
Ugh. I hope that works,

16:56.016 --> 16:57.648
'cause HR meany was
in the bathroom today,

16:57.650 --> 17:00.485
and she emptied
the tampon machine.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.521
It looked like she was
about to blow up a bridge.

17:09.228 --> 17:12.030
Has he moved yet
this morning?

17:12.032 --> 17:15.066
He scratch his nose
at... 9:20.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.101
Mm.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.671
Hey, Dad,
uh, I need a favor.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.006
No.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.575
You don't even know what it is.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.078
It's a favor.
What else do I need to know?

17:27.080 --> 17:30.248
Dad, I need you to call
your girlfriend, Janet,

17:30.250 --> 17:31.916
and smooth something over
for me.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.085
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.020
Already?
What happened?

17:36.022 --> 17:40.491
She couldn't name the original
<i>Mercury</i> astronauts.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.094
You still ask women
that question?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.896
Who cares?

17:44.898 --> 17:47.065
Maybe the families
of John Glenn,

17:47.067 --> 17:49.901
Alan Shepard,
Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom...

17:49.903 --> 17:51.102
All right, Dad,
I understand...

17:51.104 --> 17:53.871
...Gordo Cooper, Deke Slayton,

17:53.873 --> 17:55.339
Scott Carpenter...
You made your point. I...

17:55.341 --> 17:57.241
...Wally Schirra.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.177
Dad...

17:59.179 --> 18:00.945
please call her.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.080
No.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.515
You're impossible!

18:04.517 --> 18:08.019
I'll call her when she takes
seventh grade history!

18:15.194 --> 18:17.361
Don't finish that
friendly knock.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.133
Have a seat.
Oh.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.942
State your name.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.378
Uh, Warner Whittemore.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.547
So...

18:36.549 --> 18:40.318
you like looking at old ladies,
you perv? Hmm?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.919
What?

18:41.921 --> 18:45.656
You like pulling your
pickle in public, huh?

18:45.658 --> 18:49.193
Is that what
bangs your gong?

18:50.929 --> 18:53.464
Uh, who are you
recording this for?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.334
All the old ladies who
just want to take a shower

18:56.336 --> 19:00.938
without some creep tuggin' on
his tiny outside their window.

19:00.940 --> 19:04.175
Okay, I wasn't tugging
on my tiny.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.977
I... I, uh...

19:05.979 --> 19:07.612
This was a big misunderstanding.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.579
Really?
Yeah.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.314
Really? Okay, well,

19:10.316 --> 19:12.783
let's do a-a... a little
bit of research, okay?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.318
Okay.
Typey, type-type-type.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.686
Okay, look at this. What?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.357
What are all
of these settlement checks

19:19.359 --> 19:21.425
that are made out
to your former assistants?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.529
Did you spin your pee spout

19:24.531 --> 19:26.330
outside their window,

19:26.332 --> 19:30.201
like some carefree
19th-century gentleman

19:30.203 --> 19:32.670
going for a weenie walk?!

19:34.439 --> 19:36.140
Wait a minute.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.875
You're attacking
the wrong person.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.511
Warner Whittemore
is not a perv.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.446
He is terrified of sex.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.715
He didn't lose his virginity
till he was 26.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.685
Oh, actually, I-I
was 25 and a half.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.390
The one time we went
to a strip club together,

19:52.392 --> 19:54.625
he ate a cheeseburger
with a fork and knife.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.229
'Cause strippers leave you
alone if you're eating,

19:58.231 --> 20:00.164
so I just figured...

20:00.166 --> 20:02.366
(mumbles)

20:06.738 --> 20:09.173
These checks weren't for him.
They were for me.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.442
He was cleaning up my messes.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.646
Okay, Warner, you can go.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.422
Have a seat... carrot crotch.

20:32.030 --> 20:35.032
Eli's been in
with the HR lady for

20:35.034 --> 20:37.235
a long time now.
I hope he's okay.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.670
(Eli sighs)
Oh, hey.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.571
How'd it go in there?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.872
Well, I got myself

20:41.874 --> 20:43.074
out of trouble.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.375
I am not really proud of how.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.477
I'll pick you
up at 8:00.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.917
Don't wear anything
complicated.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.688
You know, Warner, I never
thought I'd say this, but

20:57.690 --> 21:01.659
thank you for sexually
harassing that woman for me.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.429
I love you, son.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.398
I love you, too, Dad.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.467
Aw...

21:09.469 --> 21:11.769
What? Nothing
happened with us.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.272
CAMILA:
It's just...

21:14.274 --> 21:17.608
I'm sorry. It's so hilarious
that anyone could ever think

21:17.610 --> 21:21.779
that you could
sexually harass anybody.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.317
I'm sorry.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.286
I can hara...

21:28.288 --> 21:30.288
I can harass someone.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.293
Okay, okay.
Well, let... let's see.

21:38.263 --> 21:40.464
Okay.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.237
Ooh, nice melons.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.406
Okay, I can't do that.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.308
I got to sanitize my hands.
