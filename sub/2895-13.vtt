WEBVTT

00:01.326 --> 00:02.646
And you got your name
on the wall.

00:02.711 --> 00:04.351
Now I want the respect
that comes with it.

00:04.496 --> 00:05.496
Meaning?

00:05.497 --> 00:06.580
I want one
of Harvey's clients.

00:06.664 --> 00:08.248
My clients are my clients,

00:08.333 --> 00:09.773
and if you don't get out
of my office

00:09.801 --> 00:10.918
in the next three seconds,

00:11.002 --> 00:12.722
something's gonna happen
between you and me,

00:12.837 --> 00:14.722
and I guarantee
it won't end with you

00:14.839 --> 00:16.340
keeping all of your teeth.

00:16.424 --> 00:17.925
Avery McKernon
was the first client

00:18.009 --> 00:19.393
I ever brought
into the firm.

00:19.511 --> 00:20.928
And they win,
like me.

00:21.012 --> 00:24.014
They know Trevor
isn't in the class,

00:24.149 --> 00:26.934
so they know he couldn't have
been the one to steal the test.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.428
I'm not going to expel
your friend.

00:28.436 --> 00:29.737
Thank you, sir.
I--

00:29.854 --> 00:31.188
There's just one thing.
I'm gonna call Harvard.

00:31.356 --> 00:34.241
Believe me when I tell you
you're never going there.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.410
Remember this?
No, you don't.

00:36.528 --> 00:38.568
Because you can't remember
something you never knew.

00:38.696 --> 00:39.730
You can't fire me.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.471
Why would I fire you
when I can break you?

00:41.566 --> 00:46.036
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big,

00:46.171 --> 00:48.122
you're going to be begging me
to take it off.

00:54.546 --> 00:56.713
First of all,
give me that Manhattan

00:56.798 --> 00:58.799
and go get yourself a drink
a man would order.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.217
Come back here
in 15 minutes,

01:00.385 --> 01:02.886
and if I still remember
who you are, I'll be shocked.

01:05.223 --> 01:08.225
Okay, so why are
we really here?

01:08.359 --> 01:10.561
I mean, you didn't just bring me
out to talk about Khaleesi.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.230
I did. Paul Porter says
I look like her translator.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.531
He's a Throner?

01:14.649 --> 01:16.369
Though he says
I'm a less-attractive version

01:16.451 --> 01:17.484
of her translator.

01:17.569 --> 01:19.069
Okay, you're just trying
to get me to say

01:19.154 --> 01:20.274
that you're hotter than her.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.738
- Am I?
- You're way hotter.

01:21.906 --> 01:23.574
But she has
that accent.

01:23.658 --> 01:24.875
Fair point.

01:24.993 --> 01:29.296
You know, look, the reason
that I brought you here

01:29.414 --> 01:31.915
is to tell you that I know
that you told Louis

01:32.083 --> 01:33.634
that I got Katrina a job.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.254
- Look, I --
- Relax, I'm not mad at you.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.089
But I do remember you
being the person

01:39.224 --> 01:40.424
who told me
not to force things

01:40.425 --> 01:41.425
that weren't meant to be.

01:41.426 --> 01:44.344
Rachel, just because
a person gives advice

01:44.429 --> 01:46.589
doesn't mean that they have
to follow that same advice.

01:46.598 --> 01:48.238
That's one of the core
principles outlined

01:48.316 --> 01:50.017
in "The Book of Donna."

01:50.101 --> 01:52.019
Seriously, though,
I didn't mean to tell Louis.

01:52.103 --> 01:53.737
It just came out.
I'm sorry.

01:53.855 --> 01:55.355
Like I said, it's fine.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.858
He actually ended up asking
if we could be friends again.

01:57.942 --> 01:59.193
And?

01:59.277 --> 02:02.579
And I told him that things would
never be the same between us

02:02.697 --> 02:04.114
unless he forgave Mike.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.499
And what did he say?

02:05.617 --> 02:08.669
He said he couldn't do it.

02:08.786 --> 02:10.621
That's easy.
The jumper over Ehlo.

02:10.755 --> 02:14.791
Wrong, the switch-hand layup
over Perkins and Green.

02:14.959 --> 02:16.079
I'm surprised
at you, Harvey.

02:16.127 --> 02:17.628
The Ehlo jumper
was a game-winner.

02:17.712 --> 02:18.962
The layup was a statement.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.465
"I can do whatever I want.
I own this league."

02:21.599 --> 02:24.134
Are you talking about Jordan
or yourself now?

02:24.219 --> 02:26.136
Is there a difference?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.638
A big difference,

02:27.772 --> 02:30.641
which brings me
to why I'm here.

02:30.725 --> 02:32.776
You can't do
whatever you want, Harvey.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.812
You want me to make things right
with Louis.

02:35.897 --> 02:37.531
He made things right
between Jeff and me.

02:37.649 --> 02:40.234
So I'm supposed to kiss his ass
forever because of that?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.486
No, you're supposed
to make peace.

02:42.570 --> 02:45.489
Jessica, I'm willing
to make peace,

02:45.573 --> 02:46.733
but that's
never gonna happen.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.991
Why not?

02:48.126 --> 02:50.127
Because Louis
is never gonna forgive Mike.

02:50.245 --> 02:53.330
Then figure out a way
to make him forgive Mike.

03:01.756 --> 03:03.340
Donna, how many times
have I told you

03:03.474 --> 03:04.508
I want you out front?

03:04.592 --> 03:06.343
I'm the only associate
with a secretary.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.437
It would be nice if people
could see my secretary.

03:08.513 --> 03:10.513
Well, then maybe your next
secretary can figure out

03:10.598 --> 03:14.184
where to put this
without coming into your office.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.103
- You're kidding?
- Not kidding.

03:16.187 --> 03:17.354
You didn't forge this?

03:17.522 --> 03:19.406
I am a lot of things,
but I am not a monster.

03:19.524 --> 03:21.692
I would do that
to neither Michael nor you.

03:21.859 --> 03:23.944
- Oh, so he's Michael now?
- Well, I'm Donna to him.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.863
He's Michael to me, which
is what I told His Airness

03:26.998 --> 03:28.081
when he called.

03:28.199 --> 03:30.250
Wait a second.
You're not kidding.

03:30.368 --> 03:31.368
He signed with me?

03:31.452 --> 03:32.892
Well, technically,
he signed with me.

03:32.954 --> 03:35.756
Holy shit, Donna.
We have to celebrate tonight.

03:35.873 --> 03:37.374
Oh, I'm gonna celebrate.

03:37.542 --> 03:39.459
You, on the other hand,
are having drinks with Louis.

03:39.544 --> 03:41.712
What?
We've been over this.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.880
Whenever Louis asks
to have drinks with me,

03:43.965 --> 03:44.965
the answer's always no.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.801
Listen to the words
that I'm saying.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.053
You are getting drinks
with Louis tonight.

03:50.138 --> 03:51.939
Fairchild's retiring?

03:52.056 --> 03:54.391
Fairchild's dead.

03:54.475 --> 03:56.075
That's almost as good
as the Jordan news.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.194
Eh, not to Fairchild.

03:57.228 --> 03:58.528
Who gives a shit
about Fairchild?

03:58.613 --> 04:00.653
The real tragedy is
I have to get drinks with Louis.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.418
Which is why I got you
a secluded restaurant

04:02.483 --> 04:04.484
with a table in the back
where no one will see you.

04:04.569 --> 04:07.404
And you'll call a half an hour
in and say there's an emergency.

04:07.572 --> 04:09.573
Already in place,
and if I can't get through,

04:09.707 --> 04:11.875
then I'll just have the waiter
spill drinks all over Louis.

04:11.993 --> 04:13.410
- You could have that done?
- Oh, please.

04:13.578 --> 04:14.778
I could have Louis
held captive

04:14.796 --> 04:16.463
in a Tibetan monastery
if I wanted to.

04:16.581 --> 04:17.998
Yeah, I don't think
you have that--

04:18.082 --> 04:19.482
Now get the hell out
of your office.

04:19.584 --> 04:20.584
I got work to do.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.506
Hmm.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.683
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Jim O'Donnell's office is?

04:36.768 --> 04:38.935
That depends. What do you know
about immigration law?

04:39.070 --> 04:41.104
What, are we talking visas,
or are you trying to process

04:41.239 --> 04:42.606
a labor certification?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.274
You know about
immigration law?

04:44.442 --> 04:46.443
Doesn't everybody?

04:46.577 --> 04:48.945
Okay, tough guy,

04:49.030 --> 04:51.782
what do you think
about my strategy on this?

04:51.916 --> 04:55.419
Hmm.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.454
- I think it's a winner.
- Why is that?

04:57.588 --> 04:59.788
Because everyone knows Gonzalez
versus State of Maryland

04:59.874 --> 05:02.626
was a kick-ass precedent,
but your case is better.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.544
It was
a kick-ass precedent,

05:04.629 --> 05:06.189
but I'm not sure that my case
is better.

05:06.214 --> 05:07.214
Oh, it is.

05:07.298 --> 05:08.181
Well, what
about Viteri versus--

05:08.299 --> 05:09.516
Trust me, it's better.

05:09.634 --> 05:13.353
Viteri needed magic dust
and a sympathetic judge to win.

05:13.471 --> 05:15.272
- Have we met?
- Nope.

05:15.390 --> 05:16.940
But I'm Mike,
by the way.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.025
Claire.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.122
Are you sure?
Because you look very familiar.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.449
Oh, that's probably because
I've been delivering packages

05:25.566 --> 05:26.983
to your office
for the last two months.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.668
but you haven't given me
the time of day,

05:28.736 --> 05:31.988
because you didn't think I was
smart enough for you.

05:32.073 --> 05:33.824
It's 915.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.659
Wait.
That worked?

05:35.743 --> 05:37.461
It's working so far,
but I'm gonna need to know

05:37.545 --> 05:39.225
your full story
if it's gonna keep working.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.380
Well, I'll tell you
the full story

05:40.498 --> 05:41.665
once you give me
your phone number.

05:41.749 --> 05:43.500
I'll give you my number
when I know the full story.

05:43.668 --> 05:46.720
How about this? I'll tell you
everything you want to know

05:46.838 --> 05:48.255
at dinner tomorrow night.

05:50.842 --> 05:53.510
In that case, I'll show you
where Jim O'Donnell's office is.

05:53.678 --> 05:55.929
Jim O'Donnell's office?

05:56.064 --> 05:58.398
Where do you think
I just came from?

06:00.000 --> 06:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:08.860 --> 06:11.361
I need you do something
for me.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.529
Okay, what is it?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.247
Never mind what it is.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.283
Unless you want to go back
to whatever you were doing

06:16.367 --> 06:18.618
before I hired you,
you'll be here at 9:00 a.m.

06:20.037 --> 06:21.371
This is the address
for your car club.

06:21.456 --> 06:22.622
Oh, yeah, your memory.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.758
I'd remember this
even if I had your memory.

06:24.876 --> 06:26.596
It was right before
our first case together.

06:26.711 --> 06:28.261
You're right,
McKernon Motors.

06:28.379 --> 06:31.381
So this time be on time
and put your seat belt on,

06:31.466 --> 06:33.717
because we're about to take
a trip down memory lane.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.502
Morning, sunshine.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.375
- What are you --
- I think you call it a prunie.

07:22.459 --> 07:25.127
Congratulations, Donna told you
my favorite breakfast drink,

07:25.212 --> 07:27.013
but what does that have to do
with the price of tea

07:27.130 --> 07:28.130
in Antarctica?

07:28.298 --> 07:29.882
Donna also told me
that you were pissed,

07:30.017 --> 07:31.851
because you found out
I gave you a client

07:31.969 --> 07:33.469
I didn't want
in the first place.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.187
Hmm. And you think this is gonna
make up for that?

07:35.305 --> 07:38.557
No, but I think giving you 50%
of McKernon Motors will.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.977
What's the catch?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.980
The catch is, you and I
are about to take a road trip

07:44.114 --> 07:46.649
to their corporate headquarters
right now.

07:48.902 --> 07:49.902
You serious?

07:49.987 --> 07:51.787
I don't joke
about McKernon Motors,

07:51.872 --> 07:53.706
and you know that as well
as I do.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.494
To Fairchild.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.330
To Fairchild.
God rest his soul.

08:01.498 --> 08:02.965
Screw his soul.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.668
You know how they say
"Heaven just got another angel"?

08:05.802 --> 08:08.721
They ain't saying it now.

08:08.839 --> 08:10.339
Why do you keep checking
your phone?

08:10.507 --> 08:13.342
- No reason. I just--
- Please, I'm not an idiot.

08:13.510 --> 08:15.144
We've been here 28 minutes,
and in 2 minutes,

08:15.262 --> 08:17.263
Donna's gonna call
with some preplanned emergency.

08:17.347 --> 08:18.681
Louis, that's not --

08:18.815 --> 08:21.100
Look, why do you think I used
Fairchild's retirement

08:21.234 --> 08:22.401
to get you to have drinks
with me?

08:22.519 --> 08:24.439
Because you knew I thought
it would never happen?

08:24.488 --> 08:26.088
Because he doesn't have
an heir apparent.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.108
Louis, if you're thinking
what I think you're thinking--

08:29.192 --> 08:31.243
Hardman's not gonna make
one of us senior partner.

08:31.361 --> 08:33.029
I'm not talking
about one of us.

08:33.163 --> 08:35.280
I'm talking about both of us
convincing Hardman

08:35.414 --> 08:37.332
that two kick-ass
junior partners are worth

08:37.451 --> 08:40.919
as much as one new
senior partner.

08:41.038 --> 08:44.540
Louis, that is the best idea
you've had since I've known you.

08:44.708 --> 08:46.876
Yeah?

08:47.044 --> 08:48.878
Here's another one.

08:54.351 --> 08:55.711
When did you come up
with this one?

08:55.719 --> 08:56.886
When you were in the bathroom
wasting 7 minutes

08:57.020 --> 08:57.887
of our half hour.

09:00.724 --> 09:02.808
Don't you have
to get that?

09:02.893 --> 09:04.610
No, I don't.

09:04.728 --> 09:06.062
Let's drink to this.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.567
Asshole.

09:13.870 --> 09:14.987
That was Donna,
wasn't it?

09:15.122 --> 09:17.623
Trevor,
this is so stupid.

09:17.741 --> 09:18.781
It's not stupid, dickhead.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.076
I want you to see it
for the first time

09:20.210 --> 09:21.327
from the middle
of the room.

09:21.411 --> 09:23.245
It's your apartment,
assface,

09:23.413 --> 09:26.082
and don't even think about
giving me a wet Willie.

09:26.216 --> 09:27.750
You suck the fun
out of everything.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.418
Go ahead.
Open your eyes, dickfoot.

09:29.553 --> 09:31.053
- "Dickfoot"?
- I was gonna use "assface."

09:31.138 --> 09:32.178
It's all I could think of.

09:32.255 --> 09:33.506
How do you even manage
in the world?

09:33.590 --> 09:34.974
Are you just gonna stand there
with your your eyes closed

09:35.092 --> 09:36.392
and mock my "dickfoot"?

09:36.476 --> 09:38.676
I'm definitely not gonna
open them to see your dickfoot.

09:38.678 --> 09:40.429
That's a good point.
I wouldn't do that either.

09:40.514 --> 09:41.680
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.569
Wow.
Holy shit.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.320
I thought you were getting
a studio.

09:48.438 --> 09:51.107
Yeah, I was going to,
but then I realized

09:51.241 --> 09:55.327
we can't both live
in a studio.

09:55.445 --> 09:56.445
What?

09:56.446 --> 09:58.831
Welcome
to Casa Evans and Ross.

09:58.949 --> 10:00.916
Trevor, I can't afford
half this rent.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.001
That's the best part.

10:02.119 --> 10:03.285
Don't worry about it.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.980
I'm gonna pay
for your whole first year.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.422
No, you're not.
I can't let you do that.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.290
Michael, I start my new job
on Tuesday.

10:08.425 --> 10:10.505
On top of that, I have
my friends and family business

10:10.594 --> 10:11.961
on the side.

10:12.095 --> 10:13.462
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
take charity from you.

10:13.597 --> 10:14.957
Look, are you gonna
make me say it?

10:14.965 --> 10:17.216
It's not charity.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.467
I graduated,
and you didn't,

10:18.602 --> 10:21.103
because you took the fall
for something I did.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.505
I owe you.

10:27.644 --> 10:29.478
Okay, I'll think about it.

10:29.613 --> 10:31.814
All right, in the meantime,
think about this.

10:31.948 --> 10:33.399
Ahh...
no, I can't.

10:33.483 --> 10:34.900
- I got a date tonight.
- All right.

10:34.985 --> 10:37.903
Wow, clubfoot, mustache,
all of the above?

10:37.988 --> 10:40.789
First dickfoot
and then clubfoot?

10:40.874 --> 10:42.908
Are words with "foot"
all you've got now?

10:43.043 --> 10:45.995
All right, smart guy, describe
her with one of your SAT words.

10:46.163 --> 10:48.464
- Bigfoot.
- That's what I'm talking about.

10:48.548 --> 10:53.419
For the record,
she's really hot.

10:55.505 --> 10:56.839
Let me get this straight.

10:56.973 --> 10:58.573
Instead of promoting
an existing partner,

10:58.675 --> 11:01.510
you want me to make both of you
junior partners.

11:01.678 --> 11:03.262
Well, not make us.
We've earned it.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.148
Earned partnership status?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.851
That's a pretty bold statement
coming from two fifth-years.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.186
Not just any fifth-years.

11:10.353 --> 11:12.353
We're the best fifth-years
this firm has ever seen,

11:12.355 --> 11:13.522
and you know it.

11:13.657 --> 11:15.574
May I inquire whose idea
this was?

11:15.692 --> 11:17.193
- It was both of ours.
- I was Louis'.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.477
That's generous of you

11:18.578 --> 11:19.695
to give him credit.

11:19.829 --> 11:23.449
It was generous of him to come
to me with the idea.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.418
The truth is, I wasn't
gonna make anyone partner.

11:27.871 --> 11:29.538
But I do like admire
your gumption.

11:29.673 --> 11:33.209
So here's
what I'm willing to do.

11:33.343 --> 11:36.378
I will advance one of you
if you prove to me

11:36.513 --> 11:38.380
which one it should be.

11:38.515 --> 11:39.755
No, see,
that's the whole point.

11:39.849 --> 11:41.433
We came in
as a package deal.

11:41.551 --> 11:42.851
You came in
with a proposal.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.138
I'm giving you a counter,
and it's take it or leave it.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.857
What sort of proof
are we talking about?

11:48.975 --> 11:51.977
Let's just say McKernon Motors
is in play,

11:52.112 --> 11:54.980
and landing them could go
a long way to making your case.

11:55.065 --> 11:56.398
No way.
We're not gonna--

11:56.533 --> 11:57.933
All right, Daniel.

11:58.068 --> 12:00.119
You want McKernon?

12:00.237 --> 12:02.454
I'll get you McKernon.

12:05.075 --> 12:07.826
We're going to McKernon Motors,
not your senior prom.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.378
Why can't we just take
the car service?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.547
Because we're going to
an engine manufacturer.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.416
We need to show up
with a bad-ass car.

12:14.551 --> 12:16.302
How about this little bad boy
right here?

12:16.419 --> 12:17.419
That's no good.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.420
Why the hell not?

12:18.421 --> 12:20.756
Because it's not just
the two of us.

12:20.924 --> 12:22.725
What do you mean?

12:22.842 --> 12:23.926
You son of a bitch.

12:24.094 --> 12:25.394
You said you and I
are going up there.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.729
You lied to me.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.053
Because if I didn't, you would
have never agreed to come.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.065
There is no way
I'm going.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.650
Yes, you are.

12:31.768 --> 12:33.568
I don't care if I have
to tie you to the roof.

12:33.603 --> 12:34.937
By the time we get
to McKernon,

12:35.021 --> 12:37.106
you and Mike are gonna
work your shit out.

12:52.748 --> 12:54.749
I can't believe
you did that.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.034
The plan was to present
a united front.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.552
And we did,
and he didn't go for it.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.954
Then you stab me
in the back?

13:00.072 --> 13:02.240
I didn't stab you in the back.
I took what he gave us.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.958
He didn't give us
anything, Harvey.

13:04.076 --> 13:05.409
He pitted us
against each other.

13:05.494 --> 13:08.079
Louis, we've been pitted against
each other since day one.

are gonna make partner?

13:12.885 --> 13:15.586
I don't give a shit
about the other associates.

13:15.671 --> 13:18.806
We toasted to making
partner together.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.842
I don't make the rules, Louis.
Hardman does.

13:20.976 --> 13:23.144

he's an asshole,

13:23.262 --> 13:25.680

telling us the deal out loud.

Mm-mm, you first.

we discussed this,

16:26.278 --> 16:27.398

And you said Louis wasn't.

17:51.413 --> 17:53.164
No, I don't need
any money.

17:53.248 --> 17:54.248
I just want
to help.

17:54.332 --> 17:56.500
All right, Columbia,
be my guest.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.036
Got a hearing Tuesday morning,
9:00 a.m.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.206
Mike, that is amazing.
Thank you.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.454
Oh, no, don't thank me yet.
I haven't even done any--

18:11.550 --> 18:15.719
Um, this might not be relevant,
but I actually saved

18:15.854 --> 18:20.558
Kumquat McGillicuddy's life
this morning, so...

18:20.725 --> 18:22.226
I'm gonna go do some work.

18:23.612 --> 18:24.862
Thank you.

18:26.982 --> 18:30.401
Mr. McKernon,
Harvey Specter.

18:30.569 --> 18:33.070
Mr. Specter, would you mind
telling me why I have

18:33.205 --> 18:36.040
two different Pearson Hardman
lawyers on my schedule today?

18:36.124 --> 18:37.324
I don't know,
but after this,

18:37.409 --> 18:38.849
you won't need to meet
the other one.

18:38.910 --> 18:39.910
You're cocky.

18:39.961 --> 18:41.045
I'm right.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.603
You're also traveling
a little light.

18:42.714 --> 18:44.748
Where's your
PowerPoint presentation?

18:44.883 --> 18:46.967
I don't need
a PowerPoint presentation.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.252
Why is that?

18:48.336 --> 18:50.804
Because every lawyer in the city
has tried to dazzle you,

18:50.922 --> 18:53.224
and you're still looking
for a date to the big dance,

18:53.308 --> 18:57.228
because they don't know
what you're looking for.

18:57.312 --> 18:59.597
What exactly
am I looking for?

18:59.681 --> 19:01.599
Loyalty.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.519
You're right.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.155
I built this company
from the ground up,

19:08.273 --> 19:10.357
and everybody that started
with me is still here.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.609
And I know why.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.110
You don't downsize
in the bad times.

19:13.245 --> 19:15.079
They stick with you
in the good times.

19:15.163 --> 19:17.448
And no other lawyer
has figured that out.

19:17.582 --> 19:18.782
Not a single one.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.201
Well, I'm the one, Avery,

19:20.285 --> 19:22.753
which is why I know
you don't want me dumping you

19:22.837 --> 19:25.122
for a bigger client
down the line.

19:25.257 --> 19:27.708
How do I know you won't
do that?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.211
Because that's not the way
I work.

19:30.345 --> 19:32.129
Well, it's a hell
of a nice sentiment.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.265
but how do I know you're not
full of shit?

19:34.349 --> 19:36.133
I'm glad you asked,

19:36.218 --> 19:40.804
because here's my
PowerPoint presentation.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.954
Okay...

19:57.038 --> 20:00.908
I have a hearing tomorrow
against Fletcher Engines.

20:01.042 --> 20:03.460
You win that,
you're my lawyer.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.702
Ok, just don't change lanes.

20:12.726 --> 20:13.578
Don't change lanes.

20:13.602 --> 20:15.637
Don't do this. Great.
Okay, you know what?

20:15.638 --> 20:17.806
This is ridiculous.
You drive like a savage animal.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.391
Louis, be a man
and suck it up.

20:19.475 --> 20:21.226
Suck it up?
I'm sitting in the death seat.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.562
Fine. I'll pull over, and you
can sit in the back with Mike.

20:23.646 --> 20:25.446
Hey, I'm not sitting in the back
with a fraud,

20:25.448 --> 20:27.649
and before you even think it,
you're not putting him up here

20:27.733 --> 20:28.813
and sticking me back there.

20:28.868 --> 20:30.035
Then what do
you want, Louis?

20:30.152 --> 20:31.369
Because there
is no way in hell

20:31.487 --> 20:33.038
I'm letting you
behind the wheel of this car.

20:33.155 --> 20:35.373
It's crystal goddamn clear.

20:35.491 --> 20:37.459
You and I sit in the back, and
he chauffeurs the both of us.

20:37.577 --> 20:39.828
Whoa, no. Even if Harvey would
agree to that, which I doubt--

20:39.962 --> 20:41.046
Shut the hell up.

20:41.163 --> 20:42.497
You're not talking.
You don't get to refuse.

20:42.582 --> 20:45.667
I'm not refusing, Louis.
I don't know how to drive.

20:47.803 --> 20:49.337
Holy shit.

20:55.595 --> 20:56.595
You wanted to see me?

20:56.679 --> 20:58.063
Uh, yes.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.015
I heard you did well
with Avery McKernon.

21:00.182 --> 21:02.067
Well,
then you heard wrong,

21:02.184 --> 21:04.352
because I killed it
with Avery McKernon.

21:04.487 --> 21:07.072
- Congratulations, Harvey.
- Thank you, Daniel.

21:07.189 --> 21:09.074
You're welcome.

21:09.191 --> 21:10.859
Unfortunately,
we can't represent

21:10.993 --> 21:12.277
McKernon Motors after all.

21:12.361 --> 21:13.662
Why not?

21:13.746 --> 21:15.196
Well, it turns out
Fletcher Engines

21:15.281 --> 21:16.748
wants to sign with us.

21:16.866 --> 21:19.084
Because they found out
I'm about to land McKernon.

21:19.201 --> 21:22.254
Yes, and they're three times
the size of McKernon Motors

21:22.371 --> 21:23.922
Well, I don't care
how big they are.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.341
I'm not dropping
my client.

21:26.425 --> 21:28.593
Yes, you are.

21:31.130 --> 21:33.048
This was your plan
all along.

21:33.132 --> 21:35.300
Of course it was.
That's how the world works.

21:35.434 --> 21:37.302
I don't give a shit
how the world works.

21:37.436 --> 21:39.387
I gave my word
to Avery McKernon.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.855
Watch yourself, Harvey.

21:40.973 --> 21:43.141
I haven't gotten where I am
by watching myself, Daniel.

21:43.276 --> 21:45.777
And I don't appreciate
being used as a stalking horse.

21:45.895 --> 21:49.698
Well, you may not appreciate it,
but let me remind you,

21:49.782 --> 21:51.149
you work for me.

21:51.233 --> 21:55.620
And I'm giving you the chance
to show me you understand that.

21:55.738 --> 21:58.790
Let me remind you you said
partnership was on the table.

21:58.908 --> 22:01.793
I'm gonna hold you to that,
and so will Jessica.

22:11.387 --> 22:12.470
Hey, fart taster.

22:12.588 --> 22:15.557
I thought you were
coming over.

22:15.675 --> 22:17.559
What, nothing?
It's a classic.

22:17.677 --> 22:19.344
I'm implying your job
is to literally taste--

22:19.428 --> 22:21.148
Hey, Trevor,
I'm in the middle of something,

22:21.230 --> 22:22.814
so I'll come over
later, okay?

22:22.932 --> 22:24.566
In the middle of what?

22:24.650 --> 22:26.568
That girl
I told you about,

22:26.652 --> 22:28.486
she interns
at a legal clinic,

22:28.604 --> 22:30.655
and I am helping her
with a case.

22:30.773 --> 22:31.856
Dickfoot
gave you homework?

22:31.941 --> 22:35.110
Okay, first of all, from now on,
her name is Claire.

22:35.194 --> 22:37.612
And second of all,
this is important, so...

22:37.747 --> 22:40.832
Dude, what the hell
are you talking about?

22:44.286 --> 22:47.288
I might have told her
that I'm in law school.

22:47.423 --> 22:49.374
Holy shit.

22:49.458 --> 22:50.959
You will do anything
to get laid.

22:51.093 --> 22:52.510
I am not trying
to get laid.

22:52.628 --> 22:55.213
I really like this girl,
and I have zero chance with her

22:55.297 --> 22:56.631
if all I am
is a bike messenger.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.726
Yeah, well, you're definitely
gonna have no chance

22:58.768 --> 23:00.301
if she finds out
that you lied to her.

23:00.436 --> 23:03.555
Trevor, I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

23:03.689 --> 23:06.891
You don't really want to talk
about anything anymore.

23:10.479 --> 23:11.863
It's about the apartment,
isn't it?

23:11.981 --> 23:14.482
- Yes it's about the apartment.
- Okay, you want the truth?

23:14.617 --> 23:16.518
I haven't given you an answer
because of Grammy.

23:16.652 --> 23:17.772
You think
I didn't know that?

23:17.820 --> 23:19.300
Then you know
she's never forgiven you

23:19.372 --> 23:20.572
for what happened
in college,

23:20.656 --> 23:22.736
and she is never, ever going
to let me live with you.

23:22.825 --> 23:24.743
Then explain to her
that this is my way

23:24.877 --> 23:26.244
of making up for what I did
in college.

23:26.328 --> 23:27.495
That is never gonna work.

23:27.630 --> 23:29.547
You know what, Michael?

23:29.665 --> 23:33.001
If you're gonna do all of this
for some girl you just met,

23:33.085 --> 23:36.888
maybe it's time you stood up
to Grammy for me.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.977
How'd it go
against Fletcher Engines?

23:43.095 --> 23:45.180
You cut them off at the knees
or put them in the ground?

23:45.264 --> 23:47.015
They put me in the ground,

23:47.183 --> 23:49.517
and on top of that, it was
in front of Avery McKernon.

23:49.602 --> 23:50.735
You lost in court?

23:50.853 --> 23:54.239
I didn't just lose.
I looked like a fool.

23:54.356 --> 23:55.356
Harvey, what happened?

23:55.357 --> 23:57.242
The general counsel
for Fletcher Engines

23:57.359 --> 23:59.527
knew every move I was gonna make
before I even made it.

23:59.662 --> 24:00.662
How could he--

24:00.746 --> 24:02.580
Because Hardman
must have tipped him off.

24:02.698 --> 24:04.018
You really think
he would do that?

24:04.033 --> 24:06.367
I wouldn't have yesterday,
but I sure as hell do today.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.203
Then you have to go
to Jessica.

24:08.337 --> 24:09.337
And say what?

24:09.422 --> 24:11.756
Hardman's managing partner.
She's not.

24:11.874 --> 24:13.875
I don't have any proof,
and I never will.

24:14.043 --> 24:15.376
Well, then
what are you gonna do?

24:15.461 --> 24:17.879
I don't know,
but I have less than 14 hours

24:17.963 --> 24:20.215
to dig through 1,000 pages
of patent law.

24:21.767 --> 24:23.768
If only there was somebody
in the office who was an expert

24:23.886 --> 24:24.886
on patent law.

24:25.020 --> 24:26.721
Donna,
I am not going to Louis.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.223
He'll never help me.

24:28.390 --> 24:30.470
Well, that's too bad,
because if you can't figure out

24:30.476 --> 24:32.143
how to patch things up
with Louis,

24:32.278 --> 24:34.195
then you don't deserve
Avery McKernon

24:34.280 --> 24:36.531
or that partnership.

24:41.237 --> 24:44.789
What's all this?

24:44.907 --> 24:48.576
Uh, a grandson can't order in
and set a table

24:48.661 --> 24:50.578
for his grandmother?

24:50.713 --> 24:52.163
A grandson can do
whatever he wants.

24:52.298 --> 24:55.467
But the answer
to your question is no.

24:55.584 --> 24:58.253
You haven't even heard
what it is yet.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.255
I know what it is,
because I've been waiting for it

25:00.389 --> 25:02.056
since that kid graduated,

25:02.174 --> 25:04.392
and you are not
gonna live with him.

25:04.510 --> 25:08.012
That boy is the reason
you got kicked out of school.

25:08.097 --> 25:10.982
You're the one that told me
to tell the dean the truth.

25:11.100 --> 25:13.401
That was before I knew
it would cost you graduating.

25:13.486 --> 25:14.986
And he's trying
to make it up to me.

25:15.104 --> 25:17.272
He's gonna pay for my whole
first year's rent.

25:17.439 --> 25:20.158
That will not make up
for putting your whole life

25:20.276 --> 25:21.609
into a tailspin.

25:21.777 --> 25:23.697
- It's a head start.
- No, it's not a head start!

25:23.746 --> 25:25.363
That boy is gonna drag you
back down with him!

25:25.447 --> 25:27.007
Grammy, I'm never gonna let
that happen!

25:27.082 --> 25:29.367
God damn it!
I forbid it!

25:36.792 --> 25:39.427
I'm sorry, Michael.
I lost my temper.

25:39.545 --> 25:42.931
But I know
what he does to you,

25:43.015 --> 25:47.969
and I know he'll
always be the same.

25:48.103 --> 25:50.355
Has it occurred to you
that maybe I'm not the same?

25:50.472 --> 25:52.640
What's changed?

25:52.775 --> 25:54.526
I met someone.

25:56.812 --> 26:01.232
And I'm gonna figure out a way
to finish school, and...

26:01.317 --> 26:03.484
and then I'm gonna go
to law school.

26:04.954 --> 26:06.704
Good.

26:06.822 --> 26:09.040
Then do it from here

26:17.249 --> 26:18.833
What's on your mind, Mike?

26:19.001 --> 26:20.168
You look lost in thought.

26:22.504 --> 26:24.422
I was just thinking
about my grandmother.

26:26.342 --> 26:30.178
We took a train trip
to D.C. once.

26:30.312 --> 26:32.063
We played I Spy.

26:32.181 --> 26:35.516
That's a nice story, Mike,
but we are not playing I Spy.

26:35.651 --> 26:38.069
I'll play. It'll remind me of
dominating Esther on our trips

26:38.187 --> 26:39.654
to see our smelly Aunt Frida.

26:39.738 --> 26:42.273
All right, if it will get
you and Mike talking, sure.

26:43.692 --> 26:46.611
I spy a fraud who probably
never even knew his grandmother.

26:46.745 --> 26:48.863
All right, God damn it,
you got a problem with me,

26:49.031 --> 26:50.365
take it up with me,
but don't ever talk

26:50.499 --> 26:51.666
about my grandmother again

26:51.750 --> 26:53.368
Oh, I forgot,
the poor orphan

26:53.452 --> 26:55.536
from New York City
who I should feel sorry for

26:55.621 --> 26:56.704
because he never
learned to drive.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.039
I'm telling you,
watch yourself.

26:58.173 --> 26:59.123
Why?
Because I hurt your feelings?

26:59.208 --> 27:00.375
- Louis!
- I don't care.

27:00.509 --> 27:02.093
For all I know, you're probably
not even an orphan.

27:02.211 --> 27:04.379
It sure as hell wouldn't be
the first time a con man

27:04.513 --> 27:05.513
tried to make that claim.

27:05.547 --> 27:06.787
- That's enough.
- No, it isn't.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.132
Yes, it is.
Pull the car over right now.

27:08.267 --> 27:10.051
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of him.

27:17.619 --> 27:19.286
Hey, you got a minute?

27:19.419 --> 27:20.670
Oh, wait.
let me turn my back,

27:20.787 --> 27:22.121
so I can give you the right
angle to---

27:22.256 --> 27:24.507
You were right.
We should have stuck together.

27:26.376 --> 27:27.793
I get it--
you need my help,

27:27.928 --> 27:30.630
because you got your ass wiped
in court this morning.

27:30.714 --> 27:33.432
You're right. I did get my ass
<i>kicked</i> this morning,

27:33.517 --> 27:34.557
but it wasn't
a fair fight.

27:34.685 --> 27:35.968
What are you talking about?

27:36.103 --> 27:38.054
Hardman accessed
my computer

27:38.138 --> 27:40.139
and fed the other side
my game plan.

27:40.307 --> 27:42.508
Okay, I'm still waiting
for the part

27:42.643 --> 27:43.809
where I'm supposed
to give a shit.

27:43.944 --> 27:46.229
Hardman did it because
I refused to dump McKernon

27:46.313 --> 27:47.863
for Fletcher
after I gave him my word.

27:47.981 --> 27:49.181
And why should I help you

27:49.316 --> 27:50.816
when you couldn't live up
to your word to me?

27:50.951 --> 27:52.285
I did live up to my word.

27:52.402 --> 27:53.986
- We went to Daniel--
- Oh, bullshit.

27:54.121 --> 27:55.488
No,
it's not bullshit.

27:55.622 --> 27:57.456
I welcomed your idea
with open arms,

27:57.541 --> 27:59.242
and by the way, when he asked
whose idea it was,

27:59.326 --> 28:00.693
I gave you the credit.

28:00.794 --> 28:03.462
You see, Harvey, that's the part
you will never understand.

28:03.580 --> 28:05.748
I didn't want the credit.

28:05.882 --> 28:07.083
I wanted us to be a team.

28:07.167 --> 28:08.384
Then let's be a team
right now.

28:08.502 --> 28:09.802
But you don't want
to be a team.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.320
You want me to help you
get McKernon

28:11.338 --> 28:12.638
so you can make partner.

28:12.723 --> 28:15.558
I want you to help me so I can
keep my word to Avery McKernon.

28:15.676 --> 28:19.011
And when I become partner,
I'll keep my word to you.

28:20.731 --> 28:22.565
What the hell word is that?

28:22.683 --> 28:24.600
That someday what you wrote
on that napkin

28:24.685 --> 28:26.936
goes up
on the goddamn wall.

28:32.409 --> 28:34.410
You seem to have done
a lot of work here, Mike.

28:34.528 --> 28:35.611
Oh, it's no big deal.

28:35.696 --> 28:37.079
It is a big deal.

28:37.197 --> 28:40.416
Mike found a loophole
in the Immigration Act of 1975,

28:40.534 --> 28:41.751
and it's gonna blow you away.

28:41.868 --> 28:43.252
I don't know about that,

28:43.370 --> 28:45.371
but it may help Hector Suarez
stay in the country.

28:45.505 --> 28:46.706
That's great.

28:46.873 --> 28:48.713
And you're more than welcome
to stay and watch.

28:48.759 --> 28:51.377
Unfortunately, Claire, I need
you to run back to the office.

28:51.511 --> 28:52.678
Marshall called in sick.

28:52.796 --> 28:54.930
I need someone
to handle the walk-ins, so...

28:55.048 --> 28:58.184
Okay.

28:58.268 --> 29:00.803
Call me.
Tell me how it goes.

29:00.937 --> 29:03.439
Yeah.

29:10.197 --> 29:11.637
What the hell are you doing?
That's--

29:11.648 --> 29:13.208
Gonna keep Hector Suarez
in the country?

29:13.233 --> 29:15.067
Yeah.

29:15.235 --> 29:16.786
Yeah, nothing's gonna keep him
in the country.

29:16.903 --> 29:18.571
So what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna buy him some time

29:18.739 --> 29:20.099
so he can get his affairs
in order,

29:20.240 --> 29:21.791
and then I'm gonna give
his children a chance to stay.

29:21.908 --> 29:24.293
I'm just--I'm--I'm sorry.

29:24.411 --> 29:26.662
Are you jealous of me
and Claire or...

29:26.747 --> 29:29.248
Hey, look, I'm not jealous,
and I was waiting

29:29.383 --> 29:31.634
for her to leave to save you
the embarrassment.

29:31.752 --> 29:32.635
The embarrassment of what?

29:32.753 --> 29:34.220
That's good work.

29:34.338 --> 29:35.671
I'm not talking
about the work.

29:35.806 --> 29:38.507
I'm talking about your
"bike messenger by day,

29:38.642 --> 29:39.892
law student by night"
bullshit.

29:39.976 --> 29:42.016
All right, you don't know
what you're talking about.

29:42.095 --> 29:43.335
What are you gonna
tell me next?

29:43.430 --> 29:46.132
Your roommate is a stripper
who's in medical school?

29:46.266 --> 29:49.652
Tell me right now--I call
Columbia, your story holds up.

29:52.439 --> 29:53.439
That's what I thought.

29:53.523 --> 29:55.403
Forget who I am,
and take a look at that folder.

29:55.442 --> 29:57.276
- This is a man's life.
- Don't touch me.

29:57.361 --> 29:58.601
If you know
what's good for you,

29:58.612 --> 30:00.496
you'll stay the hell away
from Claire.

30:10.924 --> 30:11.924
Daniel...

30:11.958 --> 30:14.543
Did you know
that some of these species

30:14.628 --> 30:17.296
can live up to 200 years?

30:17.431 --> 30:18.714
Fascinating.

30:18.849 --> 30:23.219
Did you know Fletcher Engines
is picking up the pieces?

30:23.303 --> 30:25.187
I guess congratulations
are in order.

30:25.305 --> 30:26.639
I not here for a pat
on the back.

30:26.773 --> 30:28.474
I'm here to tell you
you're making me partner.

30:28.558 --> 30:30.976
Partner?

30:31.061 --> 30:33.729
I never said signing McKernon
was the key to making partner.

30:33.864 --> 30:34.864
Yes, you--

30:34.981 --> 30:36.821
All I said was landing them
could go a long way

30:36.900 --> 30:38.150
toward making your case.

30:38.285 --> 30:39.285
Bullshit.

30:39.286 --> 30:41.070
You said partnership
was on the table.

30:41.204 --> 30:42.905
And I said I was gonna
hold you to it.

30:43.039 --> 30:44.490
And I'm going to right now.

30:45.742 --> 30:48.544
You don't hold me
to anything.

30:51.298 --> 30:56.051
But I did say partnership
was on the table, and it is...

30:56.169 --> 30:58.504
just not for you.

31:00.307 --> 31:01.257
What are you talking about?

31:01.341 --> 31:03.058
Well, I can't very well
make you partner

31:03.176 --> 31:05.261
after I just told Louis
I'm making him partner.

31:05.395 --> 31:07.680
What?

31:07.764 --> 31:10.683
You don't get it,
do you?

31:10.817 --> 31:13.269
This isn't about
bringing in business.

31:13.353 --> 31:15.634
This is about figuring out
who would do whatever it takes.

31:15.689 --> 31:17.356
I did whatever it took.

31:17.491 --> 31:18.891
You didn't do a thing.

31:18.992 --> 31:21.777
You had the chance
to triple our business,

31:21.862 --> 31:24.113
and all you had to do
was take a knee.

31:24.247 --> 31:26.031
You mean bend a knee.

31:26.116 --> 31:30.169
Yes, that's exactly
what I mean.

31:30.253 --> 31:32.204
But you're
an arrogant little boy

31:32.339 --> 31:34.256
who would rather win
than get in line.

31:35.926 --> 31:38.878
Well, what the hell did Louis do
to get in line?

31:39.012 --> 31:41.764
He did whatever it took.

31:56.696 --> 31:58.147
- Please get away from me.
- Claire, wait.

31:58.281 --> 32:00.366
- Nathan told me everything.
- Just let me explain, okay?

32:00.450 --> 32:01.784
No, explain what--
that you're a sociopath?

32:01.902 --> 32:02.952
I'm not a sociopath.

32:03.069 --> 32:04.403
I'm the same guy that you
hit it off with.

32:04.488 --> 32:05.788
No, you're not.
You lied to me.

32:05.906 --> 32:07.623
Yes, I am, and I didn't mean
to lie to you, okay?

32:07.741 --> 32:08.824
I was gonna tell you
the truth.

32:08.909 --> 32:11.460
Then why didn't you?

32:11.578 --> 32:13.629
Because you said you wanted
to be with a guy who was doing

32:13.747 --> 32:15.998
something good with his life,
and I wasn't.

32:16.082 --> 32:18.417
So what, now you're here to
tell me that all of a sudden,

32:18.552 --> 32:20.432
you want to dedicate your life
to helping people

32:20.554 --> 32:21.971
or some other lie like that?

32:22.088 --> 32:24.590
It's not a lie, and what I did
would have helped Hector Suarez.

32:24.674 --> 32:26.425
Yeah,
but you only did it--

32:26.593 --> 32:28.113
Claire, please,
you have to believe me.

32:28.144 --> 32:30.813
After I met you, I decided
to get my shit together.

32:30.931 --> 32:32.515
I am trying to get
my shit together.

32:32.599 --> 32:34.567
Okay, Mike,
you know what I hate more

32:34.651 --> 32:37.403
than guys who don't have
their shit together?

32:37.487 --> 32:40.573
It's guys who lie about
getting their shit together.

32:45.111 --> 32:47.329
Claire.

32:52.118 --> 32:55.120
Louis, fill up the tank.
I'll be back.

33:00.927 --> 33:04.380
Well?

33:04.514 --> 33:05.548
Well, what?

33:05.682 --> 33:08.050
You heard what he said.
Fill up the tank.

33:08.184 --> 33:09.468
Yeah,
I did hear what he said.

33:09.553 --> 33:11.971
He said,
"Louis, fill up the tank."

33:15.275 --> 33:16.642
Well, where I come from, it's
people who didn't go to college

33:16.810 --> 33:17.943
who fill up gas tanks.

33:18.028 --> 33:19.108
Yeah,
and where I come from,

33:19.145 --> 33:20.585
if you take another step
towards me--

33:20.647 --> 33:22.147
Oh, what, the tough kid from
the city is gonna beat my ass?

33:22.315 --> 33:23.699
Louis, I'm telling you
right now...

33:27.120 --> 33:30.489
You ruined my life.
You ruined my firm.

33:30.624 --> 33:33.876
Louis!

33:58.704 --> 34:00.705
You son of a bitch.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.873
Wait.
Harvey--

34:02.041 --> 34:03.341
Tell me right now
you weren't the one

34:03.459 --> 34:06.211
that gave Fletcher Engines
my game plan.

34:06.295 --> 34:09.297
Hardman told me he wasn't gonna
make you partner anyway.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.099
And once he offered it to me,
all I had to do was--

34:11.217 --> 34:12.551
Sell me out.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.520
How is what I did any different
than you going after

34:15.605 --> 34:17.304
McKernon Motors
in the first place?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.225
If you don't understand that
on your own, you never will.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.726
So, from now on, you stay
on your side of the yard.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.397
- I'll stay on mine.
- No, Harvey, listen to me.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.399
You told me you would fight
to get our names on the wall

34:27.533 --> 34:28.733
once you got
on the other side.

34:28.868 --> 34:30.235
I can do the same for you.

34:30.319 --> 34:31.620
Did you hear
what I just said?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.321
I don't want you
doing shit for me.

34:33.406 --> 34:34.906
Oh, so it would be okay
if you were the one

34:34.991 --> 34:36.208
who got there first?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.958
It would have been okay
if you got there first

34:38.077 --> 34:39.460
fair and square,

34:39.579 --> 34:41.663
because then I would have
believed you

34:41.746 --> 34:43.415
when you said you wanted
to be a team.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.916
I do want to be a team,
Harvey.

34:45.051 --> 34:46.251
That's why
I helped you after.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.553
No, you don't!

34:48.638 --> 34:49.804
You don't want to be a team.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.639
You just want to have it
both ways,

34:51.757 --> 34:53.225
because you're
a disloyal rat.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.982
You always have been,
and you always will,

34:55.011 --> 34:57.429
no matter what it says
on your door.

34:59.815 --> 35:02.055
Well, like you said, we've been
pitted against each other

35:02.101 --> 35:03.935
since day one.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.657
You asked how many of the
50 associates we started with

35:08.774 --> 35:10.442
would make partner.

35:10.576 --> 35:11.576
Well, you know what?

35:11.611 --> 35:12.994
I don't give a shit
about the other 49,

35:13.112 --> 35:15.413
because I'm the one
who did.

35:15.498 --> 35:18.199
I'm the one who did.

35:18.284 --> 35:19.751
And now get the hell
out of my face,

35:19.835 --> 35:20.952
because I have work to do.

35:38.020 --> 35:40.272
You know he did that
on purpose, right?

35:40.356 --> 35:41.806
Did what on purpose?

35:41.974 --> 35:44.809
He asked you to fill the tank
because he knew what you'd do.

35:44.894 --> 35:46.895
Knew what I would do?
What about what you would do?

35:48.614 --> 35:51.483
He knew that too.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.319
Louis...

35:54.320 --> 35:56.321
You never even said
you were sorry.

36:03.746 --> 36:05.714
I am sorry, Louis.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.233
I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

36:09.919 --> 36:13.171
I'm not a con man,
Louis.

36:13.306 --> 36:17.559
Every single other thing
I ever told you was true.

36:24.150 --> 36:28.320
Want to know something that I've
never even admitted to myself?

36:33.576 --> 36:35.296
I never learned to drive
for the same reason

36:35.328 --> 36:38.363
I never went to law school.

36:38.531 --> 36:41.032
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident.

36:41.117 --> 36:44.919
And ever since then,
I've never been able to--

36:45.037 --> 36:47.422
Get behind the wheel.

36:50.209 --> 36:53.094
And then Harvey gave me
a license, and I took it.

36:56.215 --> 36:59.684
You were 11 years old.

37:01.971 --> 37:05.940
I mean, you must have felt
so alone.

37:08.027 --> 37:10.147
I thought you said you
didn't believe I was an orphan.

37:12.481 --> 37:16.067
I looked it up.

37:16.152 --> 37:18.512
I had to once I found out that
you never went to law school.

37:18.571 --> 37:21.322
You mean once you found out
that I'm a fraud.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.124
You're not a fraud, Mike.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.712
You just never went
to law school.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.550
Okay, Frazier,
you get a grape.

37:34.170 --> 37:36.971
Ali, I got you
a fruit punch.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.559
You two work
your shit out?

37:43.262 --> 37:45.897
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's get the hell out of here.

37:59.612 --> 38:02.280
I should never have lied
to her.

38:02.415 --> 38:03.415
Oh, screw her, man.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.666
If she doesn't like you
for who you are,

38:04.784 --> 38:05.917
she doesn't deserve you.

38:06.001 --> 38:07.702
It's not Claire's fault.
It's mine.

38:07.787 --> 38:09.871
I know you were into her
and everything,

38:10.005 --> 38:11.289
but trust me,

38:11.457 --> 38:12.924
there are plenty of other fish
in the sea.

38:13.008 --> 38:14.092
You don't know that.

38:14.210 --> 38:15.543
For all you know,
I'm never gonna meet

38:15.628 --> 38:16.708
another girl
like her again.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.046
Michael--

38:18.180 --> 38:19.564
Trevor, if I'm gonna have
to listen

38:19.682 --> 38:20.932
to whatever
you're about to say,

38:21.050 --> 38:22.467
I'm gonna need
a joint first.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.636
Come on, I thought you were
trying to turn your life around.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.305
I'll turn my life around
tomorrow.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.441
But tonight
I'm a bike messenger, so...

38:29.525 --> 38:31.359
- Dude--
- Trevor.

38:34.363 --> 38:35.447
All right.

38:35.531 --> 38:38.650
Fine.

38:38.818 --> 38:40.318
And I know Grammy
doesn't want you living here,

38:40.453 --> 38:42.904
but you can crash here tonight
if you want.

38:54.383 --> 38:56.885
Donna.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.137
Something wrong?

38:59.221 --> 39:00.722
Why would something
be wrong?

39:00.840 --> 39:04.509
Because I don't believe you've
ever been in my office before.

39:04.593 --> 39:07.178
No, nothing's wrong.

39:07.313 --> 39:08.680
And I know
it's not my place,

39:08.814 --> 39:11.149
but I'm here to tell you that
I think you're making a mistake.

39:11.233 --> 39:16.104
Is this about me not giving
people off for Columbus Day?

39:16.188 --> 39:18.606
You know this isn't
about that.

39:18.691 --> 39:20.692
Harvey laid it on the line
with Daniel,

39:20.776 --> 39:22.243
and you didn't have
his back.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.830
Donna, I've had Harvey's back
since the day I met him.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.665
For your information,
when I found out

39:27.783 --> 39:30.034
what Daniel was up to,
I had him guarantee

39:30.169 --> 39:31.452
partnership
was on the table.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.337
And then you let him give it
to the wrong man.

39:33.339 --> 39:35.106
That is on Harvey,
not on me.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.341
What are you talking about?

39:38.511 --> 39:40.962
Daniel was worried
that Harvey couldn't put

39:41.096 --> 39:43.381
the firm's best interests
ahead of his own,

39:43.516 --> 39:45.266
and Harvey
proved him right.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.218
Or maybe you're just
telling yourself that

39:47.303 --> 39:49.888
because you don't want
to stand up to Daniel Hardman.

39:50.022 --> 39:53.858
Donna, there's a reason
why you are where you are

39:53.943 --> 39:55.503
and I am where I am,
and that is because

39:55.561 --> 39:57.979
one of us sees
the bigger picture.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.484
You knew
about Fletcher Engines?

40:03.619 --> 40:06.454
What I know is that
Harvey's time will come.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.324
And if this little incident gets
him to think about other people

40:09.458 --> 40:12.126
for a change,
then I'll take it.

40:19.301 --> 40:20.835
You're up early.

40:20.920 --> 40:25.306
I'm up early,
because I couldn't sleep.

40:25.424 --> 40:29.093
Where we you all night?

40:29.228 --> 40:31.729
You know where I was.

40:34.567 --> 40:36.568
I was staying
at my new apartment.

40:36.652 --> 40:38.436
I thought
we'd settled this.

40:38.571 --> 40:40.939
You settled it.
I didn't.

40:41.073 --> 40:44.826
I'm telling you, that kid--

40:44.944 --> 40:46.424
Grammy, for as long
as I can remember,

40:46.445 --> 40:47.946
you've been calling him
"that kid"

40:48.113 --> 40:49.831
or "that boy"
or worse.

40:49.949 --> 40:53.284
His name is Trevor.

40:53.419 --> 40:56.037
And he's my best friend.

40:57.790 --> 40:59.958
Look, I'm gonna do this thing
with our without your blessing,

41:00.125 --> 41:01.793
but...

41:03.963 --> 41:06.047
it sure would be nice
to have it.

41:08.601 --> 41:09.867
Okay, Michael.

41:09.969 --> 41:13.938
I'm not gonna lie to you
and pretend I approve,

41:14.023 --> 41:16.774
but...

41:16.859 --> 41:20.979
you're a grown man,
and I respect your decision.

41:27.236 --> 41:29.821
I love you, Grammy.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.323
I love you too.

41:37.329 --> 41:38.413
Thank you.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.465
I believe that's all
I need to know.

41:40.549 --> 41:41.989
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Pearson.

41:42.051 --> 41:45.586
I will wait
to hear from you.

41:47.890 --> 41:50.008
Oh, one more thing--

41:50.142 --> 41:54.729
does your father know you came
to me for a job?

41:54.847 --> 41:55.847
I-I--

41:55.848 --> 41:57.168
Did you really think
I didn't know

41:57.232 --> 41:59.434
you were Robert Zane's
daughter?

41:59.518 --> 42:02.520
Is that why
you're interviewing me?

42:02.655 --> 42:03.738
Because if it is,

42:03.856 --> 42:05.776
I would like to remove myself
from consideration.

42:05.858 --> 42:08.109
If you don't want to work
for your father,

42:08.243 --> 42:10.194
that's your business.

42:10.329 --> 42:12.780
I'm hiring you
because I like what I see.

42:12.865 --> 42:14.282
Hiring me?

42:14.416 --> 42:16.834
You start Monday,
if that's not too much trouble.

42:16.919 --> 42:18.586
I will be
the first one in.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.461
Aren't you gonna ask me
why I don't want to work

42:26.545 --> 42:27.595
with my father?

42:27.713 --> 42:29.263
I know why.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.099
I have a dad
just like yours.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.300
He has his own law firm?

42:32.434 --> 42:34.218
He's a surgeon.

42:34.353 --> 42:36.270
But it's
the same damn thing.

42:51.453 --> 42:53.204
- How are we on time?
- We're perfect.

42:53.322 --> 42:54.882
But I'm not going in there.
You two are.

42:54.957 --> 42:56.824
What are you talking about?

42:56.959 --> 42:58.292
I said I was giving you 50%
of McKernon.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.795
I didn't say I was keeping
the other 50%.

43:02.748 --> 43:04.916
Oh, so you finally realized
they need an upgrade

43:05.084 --> 43:06.467
in representation.

43:06.585 --> 43:07.752
Easy, Frazier.

43:07.886 --> 43:09.566
You'd still be out cold
at that gas station

43:09.588 --> 43:10.805
if I hadn't saved
your ass.

43:10.923 --> 43:12.924
Okay, I would have gotten out...
eventually.

43:13.008 --> 43:14.888
- Not from where I was standing.
- I'm slippery.

43:14.927 --> 43:16.477
I told you--
I wrestled in high school.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.346
- I checked on that. He did.
- See?

43:18.480 --> 43:20.765
Oh, and now
you're fighting for him?

43:20.933 --> 43:22.517
Okay, I guess
my job here is done.

43:22.601 --> 43:23.818
Wait.
Where are you going?

43:23.936 --> 43:25.236
I'm taking the car back
to the city.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.388
Well, what the hell are we
supposed to do?

43:27.412 --> 43:30.614
Ray's waiting on the other side
of the parking lot, isn't he?

43:30.682 --> 43:32.416
He'll drive you two back
when you're done.

43:32.517 --> 43:34.301
Wait. You know what?
I have a better idea.

43:34.419 --> 43:36.020
How about you take Ray,
we take the car,

43:36.104 --> 43:38.288
and I teach Mike how to drive
on the way home?

43:38.423 --> 43:40.657
- You'd actually do that?
- Yeah, I would.

43:40.792 --> 43:42.543
- No way.
- You don't trust me?

43:42.660 --> 43:44.161
I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you.

43:44.245 --> 43:45.379
You're a goddamn fraud.

43:45.497 --> 43:47.137
- That's what I said.
- Harvey, seriously.

43:47.165 --> 43:48.799
- Come on, I promise--
- Okay, I know you will.

43:48.883 --> 43:50.584
Louis, you make one dent
in this car,

43:50.719 --> 43:52.919
Mike's back on the street,
and your name's off the door.

43:57.175 --> 44:00.010
You think he was serious
about what he just said?

44:00.178 --> 44:01.812
Okay, well,
I'm just a little nervous,

44:01.930 --> 44:03.514
'cause I feel like I drank
that power drink,

44:03.598 --> 44:04.732
and it has a lot
of sodium in it.

44:04.849 --> 44:06.517
Actually, it's like
drinking a hot dog,

44:06.651 --> 44:08.318
but the doctor says it raises
my blood pressure, so--

44:08.403 --> 44:11.188
I'm gonna need you to let me do
the talking in there.
