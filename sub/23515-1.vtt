WEBVTT

01:18.411 --> 01:22.414
8000 years ago,
Atlantis sank beneath the ocean.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.708
The great crystal,
the source of its power,

01:24.793 --> 01:26.168
was hidden beneath the city.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.170
Robbed of the heart of Atlantis,

01:28.254 --> 01:30.631
my people seemed doomed
to slow extinction.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.509
But now we are reborn.

01:59.911 --> 02:03.872
Obby, hurry.
We must get back to the throne room.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.376
Hold on.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.229
Once again the heart of Atlantis
shines upon us,

02:27.564 --> 02:29.773
healing us, making us strong.

02:31.776 --> 02:35.112
We are using the power of the crystal
to rebuild our city,

02:35.196 --> 02:37.906
and to restore our culture to greatness.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.712
Under the light of the great crystal,
my people are thriving again.

02:51.921 --> 02:55.257
We have uncovered secrets
lost for thousands of years.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.802
The city is once again a center
of knowledge and learning

02:58.887 --> 03:01.597
instead of a place
of ignorance and fear.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.559
- Good day, Queen Kida.
- Good day and be careful.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.651
My father thought it better
to hide the crystal

03:14.736 --> 03:17.321
rather than risk the misuse of its power.

03:17.488 --> 03:21.450
As queen, I can only hope
I am doing the right thing.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.561
How fitting.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.898
The old king need never
shed tears again.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.988
Obby. Obby. All right. Come on.
Show a little respect here.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.450
I never thought the rebuilding
of Atlantis would move so quickly.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.537
I think we only understand a fraction
of what the crystal can teach us.

04:07.830 --> 04:11.500
Well, I know that none of it
would be possible without you.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.675
Okay, one rock.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.850
You know, you're getting
to look like one chubby lava dog.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.981
What is it, Obby? What is wrong?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.148
Queen Kida.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.026
There are intruders
approaching the city.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.073
Oh, my God.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.409
They're coming through the lava tubes.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.494
Where is the patrol captain?
I want them met with fliers.

04:47.662 --> 04:51.498
Wait. They're not intruders.
They're friends.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.718
It is beautiful.

05:02.844 --> 05:06.305
Yeah. It's amazing what a little paint
and spackle will do.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.905
Audrey, what are you guys doing here?

05:24.741 --> 05:27.492
Just making sure you aren't
making a mess of things down here.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.952
- Come here.
- Hey.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.330
Two for flinching.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.375
Why, thank you.
I hope my hay fever doesn't kick up.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.127
Hello.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.088
So, who wants to show me
around the city?

05:40.381 --> 05:41.757
Let me. I will do it.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.592
- No, I saw her first.
- No, no. Me, me.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.928
Boys, boys, you're both pretty.
We'll all go.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.602
Mesdemoiselles.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.068
Jeez, I missed you guys.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.403
But why are you here?

06:04.405 --> 06:05.781
Is Mr. Whitmore okay?

06:05.948 --> 06:07.282
Why don't you ask him yourself?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.535
- Milo.
- Mr. Whitmore!

06:10.620 --> 06:11.787
Not only am I okay,

06:11.871 --> 06:15.207
but this crystal of yours
makes me feel 20 years younger.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.044
Of course,
that still leaves me pretty old.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.713
And this must be Princess Kida,

06:21.964 --> 06:24.383
although, I guess,
it would be Queen Kida now.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.885
And you must be Mr. Whitmore.

06:27.303 --> 06:31.264
Thank you. You brought Milo to me
and made all this possible.

06:39.982 --> 06:43.026
Come. Let us go inside
where you can have something to eat.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.530
I guess your decision to stay here
wasn't as hard as I thought.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.741
Save my life!

06:55.081 --> 06:56.957
- You must try some of this.
- Delicious.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.084
- It's great to see you all again.
- Magnifique.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.337
- Trust me, this is great.
- Not bad.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.798
Pepper sauce.
Never leave home without it.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.717
Puts a little giddy-up in every meal.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.762
Also makes a fine paint remover.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.892
Sweet, I think this food just moved.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.019
Then you better eat it quick
before it gets away.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.314
Besides, when it's alive,
you don't have to swallow so hard.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.775
Just point them head first
so they know which way to crawl.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.029
Your grandfather would be
proud of you, Milo.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.574
You not only discovered a lost empire,

07:30.700 --> 07:33.869
you probably saved the world
from Rourke's plans for the crystal.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.373
And now you're helping
restore Atlantis to its former glory.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.209
That's quite a résumé
for a cartographer.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.712
I just wish he could be here
to see all this,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.714
and to meet Kida.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.346
Yeah, well, it's great to see
everybody together again.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.516
But something tells me
it's not just for a little reunion.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.354
I'm afraid you're right.
There's trouble on the surface.

08:02.356 --> 08:07.360
I already had my doctor, digger,
demolition expert, mechanic.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.029
Each the top of their field.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.282
But I came here for the one expert
I didn't have,

08:12.742 --> 08:14.659
an expert on Atlantis.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.578
But why would you need a...

08:16.662 --> 08:19.247
Several cargo ships have gone down
in the north Atlantic.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.708
The survivors say it was a sea monster.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.752
We thought it might be the watchdog
at your front door.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.086
The Leviathan?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.422
Right. That's one big sea monster.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.883
In the water,
that's the last thing you wanna see.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.844
Except, maybe,
my Aunt Rose in a swimsuit.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.054
Sweet woman, but very large-boned.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.474
I'm glad it knew
we were friends this time.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.267
But there could be others out there.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.561
My father had many
such machines created.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.147
He used the magic and science
of the crystal

08:44.232 --> 08:46.149
to expand the borders of Atlantis.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.527
That war nearly destroyed the world.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.363
Well, it looks like his war
may not be over.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.036
Then Milo and I will go with you
to the surface and end it.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.122
Kida, you can't.
I mean, you're the queen.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.291
The city repairs are well under way.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.211
The counselors can handle
the everyday matters.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.382
And I feel responsible
for what my father did.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.385
I want to understand his decision.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.264
And I am afraid the answers
are not in Atlantis.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.144
I feel bad. You finally get to the surface

09:23.229 --> 09:25.230
and it's so cloudy,
there's nothing to see.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.524
Everything in your world is new to me.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.319
The sky, the clouds,
everything on the ship.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.197
- What is this?
- That's a life preserver.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.827
So you wear it and it preserves your life,
like our crystals?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.830
No, no.
You throw it to someone in the water.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.873
So it is a game?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.501
No. You only throw it
if someone is drowning.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.546
Does that not make it hard
for them to play the game?

09:53.259 --> 09:56.011
Two weeks we crisscross
the North Sea and get nothing.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.764
No squids, no jellyfish
and no lobster from Atlantis.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.683
We have to be sure, Vinny.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.020
What if raising the crystal
brought this Leviathan to life?

10:05.396 --> 10:07.731
This could all be the fault of Atlantis.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.026
I'd worry more about how we fight it
than who's to blame.

10:11.527 --> 10:15.530
Last time we shot at the Leviathan,
these things didn't even tickle it.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.283
Audrey, if you keep hitting that thing

10:18.409 --> 10:20.869
we're gonna be "tickled"
all over these walls.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.038
Yeah, yeah. Like I don't know that.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.833
Well, careful. Doc Sweet's not here
to glue us back together.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.210
This time it's my special blend.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.130
I start with a batter
of gelatinous nitroglycerine,

10:32.256 --> 10:34.883
dribble it on a shaped charge of TNT,

10:34.967 --> 10:38.345
and top it with just
a dusting of black powder

10:38.804 --> 10:40.096
and oregano.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.140
You can't make a bomb
without oregano.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.100
It makes a very nice "boom."

10:44.435 --> 10:46.186
Let the lobster chew on that.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.898
You know, I really don't think
it is a Leviathan.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.233
The survivor called it the Kraken,

10:52.568 --> 10:56.029
a legendary Norwegian sea monster
with arms a quarter mile long.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.198
Nothing like what we saw in Atlantis.

10:58.282 --> 11:02.494
But Atlantean inventors always base
their designs on real animals.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.745
Like the giant squid.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.081
It may not be a Leviathan,

11:06.332 --> 11:09.000
but it could still be
an Atlantean war machine.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.835
She is right.

11:11.087 --> 11:15.924
No creature of flesh and blood
can bring down a steel cargo ship.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.719
Something's got the ship!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.097
It's ripping open the launch doors.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.810
My cheese!

11:31.065 --> 11:32.107
You can have it.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.734
Get to the sub pods.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.903
Vinny, we're gonna need that thing
out of the way.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.322
Coming up, extra oregano.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.914
Launch when ready.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.834
Next time, chili powder.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.554
That doesn't sound good.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.732
It's pulling them down
on the starboard side.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.484
Where's Milo and Kida?
I didn't see them launch.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.738
Milo, are you there? Kida?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.658
Come on, come on. Back-up batteries.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.160
Time to back-up.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.454
...thing off my back while I look for Milo.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.330
This is Milo.
We're on back-up batteries,

12:29.373 --> 12:30.832
sinking fast, no propulsion.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.542
- We have a major leak...
- Leaks.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.335
Leaks. And the view port is cracking.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.839
If the ballast valves aren't blocked,

12:37.882 --> 12:40.592
you can flush the water
by rerouting the pressure tubes and...

12:40.676 --> 12:42.927
Audrey, we are up
to our rear ends in water.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.971
It's no time for how-to books.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.056
Okay, okay. We're coming.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.809
- Jeez.
- Well, you'd better hurry 'cause...

12:50.478 --> 12:52.854
We're about to hit
an undersea mountain.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.484
That is not a mountain.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.028
- Audrey!
- Got you covered, Milo.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.874
- Watch your right dive plane.
- No problem.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.544
- Where's the Kraken?
- It has disappeared.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.298
At least it was not Atlantean.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.426
Somehow, that doesn't make me feel
any safer.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.723
The creature buckled hull plates
fore and aft.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.226
We'll be lucky to get to the port
for repairs.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.353
I'll send a launch for you.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.648
Don't worry about us, Captain.
Just take care of the Atlantean.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.566
There's a fishing village
to the northeast.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.401
We'll be there when you finish repairs.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.699
That's your sub pod.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.201
That's not coming out of my pay check.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.703
Okay, let's get to shore
as soon as we can.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.791
What's the matter, Vinny, afraid to play
patty-cake with the sea monster?

13:55.376 --> 13:57.293
No. I don't mind a little patty-cake.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.503
But I really don't wanna be here

13:58.587 --> 14:01.506
when the bombs on that sub pod
hit bottom.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.607
I guess fishing hasn't been
too good lately?

14:19.692 --> 14:23.111
That is not surprising.
No doubt that tentacled-demon

14:23.237 --> 14:25.321
devoured the local fish stocks long ago.

14:25.489 --> 14:26.990
Then why is it still here?

14:27.074 --> 14:29.868
Because it doesn't eat fish anymore.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.620
Maybe that's why they built
the village on the cliffs.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.248
You don't want that thing
showing up for dinner.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.878
Not real friendly, are they?

14:40.504 --> 14:43.298
What is that smell? It's like rotting fish.

14:43.382 --> 14:48.136
Why do you accuse such a thing?
I have bathed. Recently.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.347
No appreciation for fine cologne.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.850
Easy, Mole. She's upwind of you.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.895
I'd say it's more likely
we're smelling all this mildew.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.646
Everything is wet from the fog.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.648
But you do need a bath.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.692
Look at that.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.820
Interesting way of attracting tourists.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.989
Milo, we got company.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.747
I am Edgar Volgud,
the magistrate of this town.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.498
What is your business here?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.500
Nice to meet you.
My name is Milo Thatch.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.671
I doubt there is anything in Krakenstadt
that concerns you.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.841
And what about your town pet
that nearly sank our ship?

15:29.345 --> 15:33.640
Your ship will be repaired
at the shipyards of Trondheim.

15:33.849 --> 15:38.311
You should leave soon.
The roads are treacherous after dark.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.521
I'm sure they can
start repairs without us.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.566
We thought we'd stick around
a while and enjoy the scenery.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.819
Trondheim has excellent views.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.863
All the same, we'll stay.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.701
Miss Allyson is the innkeeper here.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.912
She'll give you rooms for the night.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.582
A driver will take you
to Trondheim tomorrow.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.336
I've seen that fellow before someplace.

16:03.545 --> 16:08.341
I think under a rock.
Reminds me of a leech, a worm.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.218
A, kind of, salamanderish...

16:11.261 --> 16:12.637
Obby, no!

16:16.433 --> 16:18.476
He was born in molten rock.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.853
Wasn't Volgud that statue guy?

16:21.188 --> 16:23.940
That would make him
even older than he looks,

16:24.108 --> 16:25.942
which I gotta say is pretty darn old.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.654
They say he made a deal
with the devil to live forever.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.116
But forgot to ask for eternal youth.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.244
This will drive the fog from your bones.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.912
- Thank you.
- Merci, mademoiselle.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.248
Thank you, Miss Allyson?

16:40.416 --> 16:44.085
Inger. There is a darkness
around Edgar Volgud

16:44.253 --> 16:47.422
and that shadow has dimmed
all that was happy here.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.050
We would leave,
but this inn is all we have.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.262
It is no place for me
to raise my little one.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.640
Things will not change here
until its power is broken.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.934
"Its"? You mean Volgud's?

17:00.060 --> 17:01.477
Or the sea monster's?

17:03.230 --> 17:05.272
I will prepare rooms for you.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.278
But do not cross Edgar Volgud.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.280
And leave as soon as you can.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.535
They gotta work
on their tourist industry.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.422
Come on. Just follow his lantern.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.141
- Where is that coming from?
- What is it?

17:40.809 --> 17:42.810
It is not of this Earth.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.813
No. That's a bird.
A very big gooney bird.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.899
Or a puffin

17:49.610 --> 17:51.152
with a very upset stomach.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.447
No, it's voices.
I can't make out what they're...

17:54.490 --> 17:56.908
- Where's Volgud?
- His light is gone.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.160
We could be walking in circles.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.162
We'd better head back to the village.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.372
And which way would that be?

18:08.545 --> 18:13.091
Over there. Head for the lights
before the fog closes in again.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.013
Just a moment. Listen to the gravel.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.350
- Not now, Mole.
- But this is decomposed granite

18:22.434 --> 18:24.977
which would mean we are
headed for the cliff.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.449
Audrey!

18:40.994 --> 18:42.370
I'm okay.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.457
For now.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.669
Be careful, Milo.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.045
I'm climbing down to you, Audrey.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.255
Stay where you are.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.966
Here I was, all set to take a walk.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.761
Audrey, keep talking to me.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.222
I said, "Thank you very much
for leading us off a cliff."

19:01.723 --> 19:04.892
Hey, I was heading toward the village...

19:06.395 --> 19:07.770
Lights?

19:08.605 --> 19:11.274
I guess there's more going on here
than sea monsters.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.901
Great. Somebody's doin' hocus-pocus.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.112
I hate hocus-pocus.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.700
I can't reach.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.744
- I'll have to jump.
- Don't jump.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.290
- I'll climb down.
- There's no room. I have to jump.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.668
Audrey, I'm the team leader,
and I order you not to jump.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.378
That's it!

19:37.759 --> 19:38.926
See?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.179
Audrey!

19:45.058 --> 19:48.102
You see, you cannot live without me.

19:55.110 --> 19:59.071
Gather the possessions
of the strangers and burn them.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.743
What's the matter, Volgud?
You think we've got fleas?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.954
Gee. You seem surprised to see us.

20:09.416 --> 20:13.669
Definitely worm or leech.
Salamanders are too cute.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.631
We'd like to hear more about
Volgud's deal with the devil.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.259
It is an old wives' story,
a folk tale, nothing more.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.386
Inger, we want to help.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.307
Lives have been taken at sea,
and I suspect in this town.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.019
I would love to let my little one
play outside again.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.814
Long ago, the fish left the sea.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.192
The town was in danger of dying.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.985
A bargain was struck.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.864
The souls of the people
for the life of the town.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.618
- The Kraken?
- Sometimes known as the "devil fish."

20:46.328 --> 20:49.956
The town is provided for,
but no one can leave.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.750
And the sun has not shone since.

20:53.669 --> 20:57.213
Folklore or not, there is a connection
between the Kraken and this town.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.132
Volgud hands out food
and supplies from somewhere.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.593
Maybe a hidden cave?

21:02.886 --> 21:05.930
I could search.
Would make a very nice boom.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.226
The answer is
staring at you right in the face.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.688
Regard how an igneous boulder

21:13.772 --> 21:17.608
has been futilely disguised
as sedimentary rock.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.152
They might as well paint a road sign.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.411
They look exactly the same to me.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.330
Yeah, but you weren't
raised by naked mole rats.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.708
That would explain so much.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.850
This is all from the sunken freighter.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.687
There's Volgud.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.846
- Volgud is controlling the Kraken.
- How?

22:29.056 --> 22:31.140
Table scraps
and a rolled-up newspaper?

22:31.224 --> 22:33.559
He's not using table scraps.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.811
It's some sort of mental power.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.606
Look at the workers.
They look hypnotized.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.943
I think he uses that power
to enslave the creature,

22:43.028 --> 22:44.487
telling it what ships to attack.

22:45.072 --> 22:49.116
If we can rattle Volgud's concentration,
he'll lose control over the Kraken.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.284
Tickling will be good.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.745
Nobody can concentrate
when they're being tickled.

22:52.788 --> 22:57.124
Or a bomb.
A bomb is a very good distraction.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.337
Wait. Where's Audrey?

23:27.656 --> 23:29.407
Get Audrey. I'll distract him.

23:35.038 --> 23:38.624
What? But he's unconscious.
It should go away.

23:38.708 --> 23:39.750
Audrey!

23:55.684 --> 23:58.519
Okay, now we try Plan B. Plan Bomb.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.898
No. Not at the creature. At the ceiling.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.279
How about picking the target
before I light the dynamite?

24:27.674 --> 24:31.218
Get to the sub pods. We have to
stop the Kraken from getting out.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.438
Out of our way, barbarians!

25:04.252 --> 25:06.795
Talk to me, Mole.
We got to find that cave exit.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.423
Our best chance to trap
the Kraken is to seal him inside.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.512
Audrey, you doing all right?

25:14.679 --> 25:18.098
Yeah. Now. It was creepy.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.808
All cold and slimy.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.853
Everything faded away
like I was drowning.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.441
Hey, pay attention!

25:28.568 --> 25:31.737
It is too dark to see.
Fire the magnesium flares.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.325
What are you doing?
We want to sneak up on...

25:38.203 --> 25:41.038
Jiminy Christmas! It's already out!

25:48.171 --> 25:49.630
Stay clear of the tentacles.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.299
No kidding. I'm gonna take a shot.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.819
It's no good.
I can't line up a decent shot.

26:11.903 --> 26:12.945
We're on him.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.656
Open wide. It's chow time.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.745
What are you waiting for? Fire the...

26:26.209 --> 26:27.459
Jeez!

26:29.212 --> 26:32.256
Tell him to watch his aim.
He almost hit Aud...

26:32.340 --> 26:33.465
Look out!

26:40.724 --> 26:42.725
Shoot at the squid, not us!

26:43.143 --> 26:44.852
Vincent has gone mad!

26:45.145 --> 26:47.271
- His mind is a blank.
- But Volgud...

26:47.606 --> 26:50.316
It's not Volgud. It's the Kraken.

26:52.861 --> 26:56.196
Of course. The Kraken is the one
with the mind powers.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.617
It is okay. I have distracted him.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.620
Watch out! Monster on the move!

27:16.551 --> 27:18.385
That was really strange.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.445
- I'm down to my last shot.
- As am I.

27:36.946 --> 27:40.115
Head back to the beach.
We've got to get on dry land.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.577
No.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.249
Are you crazy?
You're heading right at it!

27:49.334 --> 27:51.001
I will distract him again.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.045
I am blinded!

27:53.088 --> 27:54.588
It's Milo's sub pod.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.258
It's got a full load of torpedoes.
We can blow them all at once.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.594
Let's do it!

28:30.291 --> 28:34.795
You know, I think Mr. Squid was
a little bit hocus-pocus himself.

28:56.484 --> 28:59.486
Yeah, you won't find
the Kraken in any biology book.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.613
The curse is lifted, the fish are back,

29:01.656 --> 29:03.866
and the mildew
has been scrubbed away.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.660
So if something stinks now...

29:07.036 --> 29:09.413
What? Why you do this with your hand?

29:09.497 --> 29:11.206
It is the fish.

29:12.667 --> 29:16.170
For 8,000 years,
I have lived with the same faces.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.922
It is strange to meet new people.

29:19.215 --> 29:22.426
And each new person
has new thoughts, new ideas.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.636
Your world has much to offer.

29:24.804 --> 29:29.892
I hope one day my people, the people
of Atlantis, can offer as much.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.935
There's no reason they can't.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.522
Your people can make a difference
to the world, like we did here.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.901
Now that there's no Kraken,
it's left to people like Inger Allyson

29:38.985 --> 29:41.069
to raise their little ones in peace.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.363
We can never thank them enough.

29:43.698 --> 29:46.366
Now you can grow big and strong

29:46.534 --> 29:50.078
and someday be the most
important person in town.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.665
Now give Mama a big hug.

30:00.173 --> 30:03.217
Please tell me that's not the same stuff
you fed us on the way to Atlantis.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.593
Bet your sweet eyes it is.

30:04.677 --> 30:08.889
Now I told you
it would keep and keep and keep.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.476
And now it's yours
to eat and eat and eat.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.230
That's right, Margie.
They showed me all around the city.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.900
Yeah. It broke their hearts,
but I need my space.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.569
Kemot was too clingy.

30:25.448 --> 30:29.409
Careful, Mole. Obidalbedsugs aren't
used to such a variety in their diet.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.914
It's only a few assorted silicates
I've been meaning to get rid of.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.378
It's good for the gums.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.175
Hey, where's Kida?

30:50.765 --> 30:53.225
It's even more beautiful
when the snow melts.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.103
This time there was no Leviathan.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.606
But how do we know there are not
other Atlantean weapons out there?

31:00.608 --> 31:02.276
Not looking at the scenery?

31:02.443 --> 31:04.361
Maybe the crystal's too powerful.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.446
Maybe it should remain buried.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.491
But your people,
they've regained so much.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.244
Could you put them in darkness again?

31:17.250 --> 31:20.752
What are the chances of another
gas leak in a Chinese laundry?

31:21.129 --> 31:23.255
So, that's my last flower shop.

31:23.631 --> 31:26.174
But I'm thinking about buying a laundry.

31:35.268 --> 31:38.812
So, I guess now that we know
there's no Leviathan on the loose...

31:38.897 --> 31:40.147
- Excuse me.
...you two

31:40.231 --> 31:42.149
will be heading back home to Atlantis.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.276
Excuse me.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.236
It's a laundry-slash-fireworks...

31:46.321 --> 31:49.573
But don't be in such a rush.
Take some time to see the world.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.491
Plane fare is on me.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.201
That's very generous, Mr. Whitmore.

31:53.286 --> 31:56.830
May I have your attention, please?

31:57.957 --> 32:00.500
That's better. It's Dr. Sweet.

32:00.835 --> 32:03.003
There's trouble in the Southwest.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.509
Sam's a long-time
field agent of Mr. Whitmore's.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.595
He's best at digging up
hard-to-find objects.

32:11.679 --> 32:14.222
Only this time,
I think something found him.

32:14.474 --> 32:18.185
And you say he mentioned
killer coyotes in a sandstorm?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.604
No, not exactly.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.356
More like a sandstorm

32:22.440 --> 32:24.816
made up of killer coyotes
who were made up of sand.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.235
And this is unusual in your world?

32:27.987 --> 32:29.905
Yes. More than a little bit.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.616
But I do not understand
why you wanted me here.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.534
Because of this.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.082
Milo, it is Atlantean.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.959
Where did you find this?

32:42.251 --> 32:43.502
You'll have to ask Sam.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.295
I can't tell if he's breathing.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.089
Perhaps he is dead.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.550
He's just sleeping.

32:50.593 --> 32:52.678
After what he's been through,
I'm sure he can use the rest.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.598
Hey. Get away, you furry carcass rats!

32:56.766 --> 33:01.103
It's all right, Mr. McKeane.
You're safe now. Mr. Whitmore sent us.

33:01.854 --> 33:05.857
Good old Preston.
Best man I ever scavenged for.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.528
Say, young fella,
could you fluff up my pillow?

33:12.115 --> 33:16.118
Now how about a sip of water?
My gullet's awful dry.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.253
- What's wrong?
- Got a little sleepy in the foot.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.672
Would you mind givin' it a rub?

33:30.341 --> 33:32.300
And you say coyotes did this to you?

33:32.385 --> 33:34.761
No. 'Twernt no ordinary coyotes.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.764
These was cantankerous sand coyotes.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.766
'Twernt a lick of wind all day,

33:39.892 --> 33:43.270
but I sure heard it howlin'
up on the mesas that night.

33:44.856 --> 33:49.776
I thought I was loco when I saw them
dust devils materializing in moonlight.

33:50.028 --> 33:54.406
Their red eyes like to burn
a hole right through my soul.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.284
Came screamin' off that ridge
like a pack of ghosts.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.619
I ran back to my shack
and bolted the door.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.788
I figured I'd be safe if I stayed inside.

34:01.873 --> 34:02.956
I was wrong.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.710
Scratched me up like a two-sizes
too small wool sweater

34:06.794 --> 34:08.045
on a hot afternoon.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.464
Luckily, I had plenty of bacon grease

34:10.505 --> 34:12.716
to rub all over my hide
to ease the chafin'.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.467
Dinnertime.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.638
Mr. McKeane, what have we told you
about the bacon grease?

34:18.723 --> 34:22.141
Works better than any
of your darn fool fix-'em-ups.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.811
I stood a better chance
with them coyotes.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.563
- Is he going to be all right?
- Yes.

34:27.774 --> 34:31.443
We're moving him to the hospital in
Scottsdale where he'll be their problem.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.695
So where did you find this?

34:35.489 --> 34:37.157
- In a pot.
- What pot?

34:39.827 --> 34:41.453
- In the crate.
- What crate?

34:43.331 --> 34:45.498
- In my shack.
- What shack?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.085
I'm not surprised this is where he lives.

34:48.335 --> 34:51.338
You saw the man eat, right?
Lives like he eats. Sloppy.

34:51.630 --> 34:52.714
Maid's day off?

34:56.469 --> 34:59.846
Quartz, silicate, mixed with local clay.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.892
Slightly nutty to the taste.
Nothing unusual.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.311
Sand isn't the only thing here
that's nutty.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.355
Everything seems to have been
rubbed smooth.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.066
Even the windows are etched.
From the sand?

35:11.484 --> 35:13.568
McKeane said they were sand coyotes.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.738
I see lots of sand, no coyotes.
No paw prints either.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.366
- Looks like the crate's...
- Missin'?

35:19.617 --> 35:24.037
Dang blame it! I know just what
varmint done took it too.

35:24.122 --> 35:29.459
It'd be that shifty-eyed, back-stabbin'
rattlesnake Ashton Carnaby.

35:29.544 --> 35:33.380
He runs a tradin' post outside of town.
You best be careful.

35:33.464 --> 35:37.259
He's slicker than
a sweaty toad in a rainstorm.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.219
Let's look around a little first.

35:39.303 --> 35:42.139
We don't know for certain that
this Carnaby guy took Sam's crate.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.892
No, Obby! Stay! Stay!

35:50.231 --> 35:52.065
He's a Brazilian iguana.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.985
Eats just about anything. Trust me.

35:58.906 --> 36:02.033
There are pieces here that
are hundreds of years old.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.910
Look, an antique.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.956
How are people to use these things
if they're locked behind glass?

36:08.249 --> 36:09.332
It's for protection.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.918
I know what the spear is for.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.879
But why is it in a glass case?

36:14.088 --> 36:16.339
No, the glass case is for protection.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.593
Wouldn't the spear be better
protection than a glass case?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.261
Yes. No!

36:21.596 --> 36:23.763
It's there to protect from someone
who might want to steal it.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.518
Why would someone want
to steal a glass case?

36:29.645 --> 36:33.607
Calcified limestone
more than 25 million years old

36:33.733 --> 36:35.317
from the Cenozoic Era.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.946
Hydrated aluminum silicates
with basalt

36:40.072 --> 36:43.325
found primarily in the southern
Colorado River Basin.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.412
Plastic!

36:53.252 --> 36:56.630
Milo, it's just like an Atlantean guardian.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.715
Well, not exactly.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.551
It's been modified by Noshoni design.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.346
Either way, I am buying it.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.389
That's what I like to hear.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.434
Because I want to sell it.
The name's Carnaby.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.394
Now, that painting's of Crystal Guardian

37:11.479 --> 37:14.147
who crawled from the earth
with weapons of blue fire.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.441
He was a great teacher
and healer of the sick.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.984
Or so the legend goes.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.319
How much is it?

37:19.487 --> 37:21.821
Well, that's a museum-class piece.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.449
I'll bet there's a museum-class price
to go with it too.

37:25.034 --> 37:27.077
It is rare, and I've had offers.

37:27.161 --> 37:28.161
Is this enough?

37:28.329 --> 37:31.289
- Kida, that's a lot...
- Sold! One Crystal Guardian.

37:31.832 --> 37:36.002
So, Mr. Carnaby, where exactly
do you get all of your artifacts?

37:36.212 --> 37:37.796
Well, here and there.

37:38.172 --> 37:41.800
But the older pieces are
100% authentic, I assure you.

37:42.009 --> 37:43.176
I don't doubt that.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.803
Well, we're looking for a crate

37:44.845 --> 37:46.638
that may have been taken
from Sam McKeane.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.015
Who are you people?

37:49.433 --> 37:51.017
We're associates of Sam McKeane,

37:51.102 --> 37:53.186
and he's asked us to help locate
the missing crate.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.772
Can't help you.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.983
McKeane has a tendency to tell stories.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.985
I think he gets lonely
out there in the desert.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.779
So you don't know anything about it?

38:02.989 --> 38:06.700
If McKeane lost a crate of pottery,
that's not my problem.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.870
What in the Red Rock River Valley
are you doin'?

38:11.247 --> 38:12.789
Sampling the bowl.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.208
It is very nice.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.168
Would you like some?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.464
Well, that could have gone better.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.217
Does it strike anybody as odd

38:24.260 --> 38:26.761
that Carnaby knows the missing crate
contains pottery?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.471
Because I never mentioned
what was in it.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.597
You are right.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.058
I don't trust that Carnaby.
Don't like him one bit.

38:32.184 --> 38:34.144
Didn't like his attitude.
Didn't like his shifty little eyes.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.895
Eyes are the windows to the soul,
you know?

38:39.567 --> 38:43.194
How would you like to gaze
into the windows of my soul?

38:45.531 --> 38:48.074
Hey, didn't we just pass that guy?

38:52.038 --> 38:53.330
Perhaps they are brothers?

38:58.085 --> 39:00.253
Twice is a coincidence.
But three times?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.838
I think someone's trying
to tell us something.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.175
Hello. Can we offer you a ride?

39:05.259 --> 39:09.095
It's a long walk to anywhere.

39:09.263 --> 39:12.682
My name is Chakashi.
And, yes, a ride would be welcome.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.354
He's Brazilian.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.856
I'm familiar with all nature's creatures.

39:19.982 --> 39:22.067
This one is also known to me.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.614
You wouldn't happen
to have a twin or two, would you?

39:27.865 --> 39:30.742
There are many Noshoni men
who walk alone in the desert.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.620
And we look all the same
to the eyes of outsiders.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.290
Crystal Guardian,
our great teacher and protector.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.043
He revealed many secrets
to the Noshoni.

39:40.628 --> 39:44.964
The path of the stars, the time to plant,
how to heal themselves.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.883
And like Crystal Guardian

39:47.009 --> 39:50.303
we will also protect our
sacred beliefs from outsiders.

39:50.554 --> 39:54.140
Those who would plunder
our lands to betray our secrets

39:54.350 --> 39:57.310
will answer to the ancient
forces of the desert.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.038
A sandstorm?
Where did that come from?

40:20.501 --> 40:21.751
We are followed.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.006
There are ancient powers

40:27.049 --> 40:29.259
that will make certain
our secrets are kept,

40:29.510 --> 40:32.512
and you, more than anyone,
should understand this.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.974
They're trying to drive us off the road.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.939
I just put in that windshield.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.776
- He's gone!
- How? Where could he go?

40:46.902 --> 40:49.779
People, we got bigger problems.
They're in here with us.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.659
No. Dust doggies, go away!

41:01.500 --> 41:03.084
This is just great!

41:03.377 --> 41:06.171
The intake's got a 30 torque tolerance
that's been blown

41:06.213 --> 41:08.381
and the combustion valves
need a new ring slip.

41:08.757 --> 41:10.133
I didn't quite get all that.

41:10.217 --> 41:12.218
I build these engines from scratch.

41:12.511 --> 41:15.054
I fend off lava dogs
who eat the distributor caps.

41:15.681 --> 41:19.100
And nobody told me I would
have to deal with dust storm coyotes.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.479
If they got sand in the manifold, I quit!

41:22.730 --> 41:24.189
Did you get it all that time?

41:24.231 --> 41:25.315
Every word.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.568
We have returned.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.112
We are back at the trading post.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.865
Chakashi said there were
ancient forces at work.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.742
Make a note to stay on their good side.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.578
Better, yet,
no more picking up hitchhikers.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.293
Hey, I told you people to leave.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.961
We have a couple of questions.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.880
I've already answered your questions.

41:51.383 --> 41:54.844
Pet iguana. Eats anything.
Meaning you might be on the menu.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.391
How do you know that
the missing crate contains pottery?

42:01.268 --> 42:02.894
I don't. I...

42:02.978 --> 42:04.687
And what do you know
about an old man

42:04.772 --> 42:06.105
who calls himself Chakashi?

42:06.649 --> 42:09.609
I know I got a shelf full
of painted rocks of him inside.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.903
Of course. Chakashi.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.655
The Noshoni wind spirit.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.281
We gave a ride to a spirit?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.784
You can't really believe
in that superstition.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.327
Well, we were just attacked

42:19.411 --> 42:21.454
by a pack of phantom coyotes
in a sandstorm.

42:21.956 --> 42:25.041
The same restless spirits
that came after Sam McKeane.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.460
And whoever has that crate of pottery.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.004
Save it. I'm not superstitious.

42:32.299 --> 42:35.552
I smell old pottery.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.973
You had the crate all along.

42:41.934 --> 42:45.228
It's rubbed smooth.
Just like the inside of McKeane's shack.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.522
Well, there's no way you could prove it.

42:47.606 --> 42:50.149
Sandstone, heavy red oxides, basalt,

42:50.192 --> 42:53.987
encrusted with the same silicate
found in McKeane's shack.

42:57.950 --> 43:00.326
Well, so what?
McKeane found it in the desert

43:00.494 --> 43:03.413
and then while he was in the hospital,
I found it in his shack.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.373
That is called stealing.

43:05.666 --> 43:08.084
That's called commerce, honey.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.044
Besides, McKeane's the only one

43:10.129 --> 43:12.171
who knows the location
of where the pot came from.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.633
Judging from the high alkaline content,

43:15.676 --> 43:20.013
I would say it came from a cave
on the south face of the Mogollon Rim

43:20.180 --> 43:21.848
15 miles north of here.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.476
He's good. Dirty, but good.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.482
Well, you know, maybe I didn't
take things seriously enough.

43:31.650 --> 43:34.736
There are a lot of old tales
and mysteries out here in the desert.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.113
And the coyotes you encountered
are a good example.

43:37.323 --> 43:39.032
I thought you didn't believe.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.160
Well, I sure don't want to end up
like McKeane.

43:42.620 --> 43:46.497
So maybe if the pot's returned,
that'll settle these restless spirits.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.499
I, Gaetan Moliere, have done it.

44:30.042 --> 44:32.418
I have found the subterranean gateway

44:32.461 --> 44:36.422
that is the very threshold
to the unknown!

44:38.884 --> 44:40.760
- It's just a hole.
- A hole?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.763
Look at the lines in the basalt.

44:43.847 --> 44:47.266
The beauty of the erosion.
The poetry of the clay.

44:47.309 --> 44:51.104
This is not a hole. It is a tunnel.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.439
I don't care what you call it.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.733
Just tell me it's big enough to hide in.
'Cause we got company.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.872
Inside! Quick!

45:21.468 --> 45:23.302
I will save us!

45:35.607 --> 45:36.816
Milo.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.654
Holy cats!

45:42.781 --> 45:46.325
None of this should exist.
Not in the same place.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.454
It's a blending of every culture
from Idaho to Peru.

45:49.997 --> 45:53.374
Noshoni, Aztec, Mayan, Olmec.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.460
My people were here.

46:07.222 --> 46:09.515
Crystal Guardian was an Atlantean.

46:09.683 --> 46:12.477
His teaching influenced
all these cultures.

46:14.188 --> 46:16.647
A little bit of Atlantis goes a long way.

46:18.525 --> 46:21.152
Carnaby, that old pot can fit
on any of those ledges.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.279
Carnaby?

46:26.366 --> 46:27.533
What is that?

46:27.993 --> 46:29.243
Sorry. It was me.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.455
Hold on. That was not me!

46:34.208 --> 46:35.500
Carnaby!

46:35.876 --> 46:37.251
About the pot.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.838
It looks like I'm going to be keeping it
along with everything else in here.

46:42.132 --> 46:45.259
That home-made prairie grass
mixture makes a good sleeping gas,

46:45.344 --> 46:46.385
wouldn't you agree?

46:48.931 --> 46:51.057
Carnaby, you snake!

46:56.063 --> 47:00.733
Naturally, I can't let you go free
to tell the world about my discovery.

47:00.776 --> 47:05.196
I mean, where's the profit in that?

47:05.906 --> 47:07.698
What? Carnaby!

47:07.950 --> 47:11.035
Nice nap? Hope the rocks
weren't too uncomfortable.

47:11.245 --> 47:15.706
No. This particular aggregate
is very nice. One of my favorites.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.377
You will not get away with this.

47:20.420 --> 47:21.462
Let's see.

47:21.547 --> 47:23.256
I trap you and your friends in this cave

47:23.340 --> 47:25.675
and then I take
all the treasure for myself.

47:25.759 --> 47:27.927
Well, I think I'll get away with it.

47:28.220 --> 47:30.763
I knew there was something shifty
about you. Didn't I say so?

47:30.931 --> 47:33.266
I said, "I don't trust that Carnaby.
Don't like him one bit.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.268
"Don't like his attitude.
Don't like his shifty little eyes."

47:35.394 --> 47:38.271
And don't forget.
The eyes are the windows to the soul.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.731
That's right. I said that too.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.109
Well, you and your friends
will have a long time

47:43.235 --> 47:46.946
to discuss how you feel about me
while I'm gettin' rich.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.117
We have found evidence
of my people here.

47:51.368 --> 47:53.119
We cannot let him destroy it.

47:53.287 --> 47:57.081
Mr. Carnaby, obviously we've had
some sort of miscommunication here.

47:57.165 --> 47:59.750
I don't see any reason why
we can't work something out.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.628
Save your breath, junior.
You're gonna need it.

48:06.049 --> 48:07.341
Happy trails.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.262
It's no use.

48:11.305 --> 48:13.973
If there was only some way
to cut these ropes.

48:15.809 --> 48:18.811
- Obby!
- Obby, come on, boy. Wake up.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.397
Wake up!

48:25.652 --> 48:27.570
That's it. Okay. Enough!

48:31.283 --> 48:33.826
No! No! Get the ropes! The ropes!

48:38.248 --> 48:39.498
Good boy.

48:39.958 --> 48:42.084
No! Take care of the dynamite first!

48:42.419 --> 48:43.794
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

48:57.851 --> 48:58.851
Kida!

49:03.023 --> 49:05.650
You've managed to be more trouble
than I expected.

49:06.151 --> 49:08.486
I'll just take care of you myself.

49:11.114 --> 49:13.574
Now you done it.
Gone and made us mad.

49:27.756 --> 49:28.881
What is this?

49:28.924 --> 49:30.049
Retribution.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.615
Anyone out here got a doggy bone?

50:10.590 --> 50:11.924
What happened to Carnaby?

50:12.384 --> 50:13.926
He is with us now.

50:14.219 --> 50:16.887
You seem like good people. I'm sorry.

50:17.389 --> 50:20.391
The secrets of the ancient ancestors
must remain a secret.

50:20.767 --> 50:22.935
You will not be allowed to leave.

50:26.481 --> 50:29.775
Chakashi, we also carry a great secret.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.319
Thus, we can keep yours as well.

50:32.654 --> 50:34.030
What is this secret?

50:34.406 --> 50:37.283
Prove to me that it is as great
as what you see around you.

50:40.829 --> 50:41.829
We can't.

50:42.289 --> 50:43.330
Very well.

50:43.623 --> 50:45.583
You have decided your fate.

51:10.650 --> 51:11.984
If you had told me your secret

51:12.486 --> 51:14.653
I would have known
I couldn't trust you with mine.

51:15.489 --> 51:16.947
It was a trick question.

51:17.157 --> 51:18.824
Must be the coyote in me.

51:19.159 --> 51:22.161
Kida of Atlantis,
you and I are not so different.

51:22.412 --> 51:25.581
Your people touched the corners
of the globe, teaching and healing.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.166
Doing great good.

51:27.501 --> 51:29.752
But they also did great harm,

51:29.961 --> 51:32.838
almost destroying the world
and themselves.

51:33.006 --> 51:37.384
My father feared the temptation
to abuse our power would be too great.

51:37.844 --> 51:39.011
So he hid it away.

51:39.387 --> 51:42.306
The secret you carry
is neither good nor bad.

51:43.016 --> 51:47.061
A strong leader must have the wisdom
to know when to share that knowledge.

51:47.437 --> 51:51.107
It would be wonderful if my people
did not need to remain hidden,

51:51.525 --> 51:54.068
to have them walk
the surface of the world again.

51:56.655 --> 51:58.155
It is your choice.

52:06.331 --> 52:07.456
That was impressive.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.542
I would have been more impressed

52:09.626 --> 52:11.502
if Chakashi had dropped us off
on the ground.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.506
A winter thunderstorm?

52:16.258 --> 52:19.218
It's strange, all right.
Started early this morning.

52:19.302 --> 52:22.429
But I guess you had your share
of weird weather in the Southwest.

52:22.889 --> 52:26.058
It was okay. Except for how
I keep finding sand everywhere.

52:26.434 --> 52:28.394
I could go for some warm weather
about now.

52:28.687 --> 52:29.979
Maybe get a tan.

52:30.397 --> 52:31.939
Sorry I missed it.

52:32.023 --> 52:33.274
No, you are not.

52:33.817 --> 52:39.405
There were dust doggies everywhere.
But I did find this very tasty bowl.

52:42.117 --> 52:45.452
Well, Mr. Whitmore, Kida and I
had better be going because...

52:45.537 --> 52:47.580
Atlantis is waiting.

52:48.206 --> 52:50.708
- I know. Just as well.
- What?

52:50.917 --> 52:52.459
We had break-in last night.

52:52.752 --> 52:55.421
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

52:55.547 --> 52:58.007
But it burns me that
someone could waltz right in here

52:58.091 --> 53:01.886
and steal something right off my wall,
an ancient Norwegian spear.

53:01.928 --> 53:03.846
Kind of a fancy old letter opener.

53:04.097 --> 53:06.849
What you needed was
a glass case to protect it.

53:09.436 --> 53:11.604
He must have come
in the middle of the night.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.732
By the tracks I found,
he had some kind of dog with him.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.834
The real strange thing is,
near as I can tell,

53:33.919 --> 53:35.628
there's no sign of forced entry.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.300
Whoever it was

53:41.343 --> 53:43.344
knew exactly
what they were looking for

53:43.428 --> 53:44.678
and helped themselves.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.814
With this Spear of Destiny,

53:57.484 --> 54:01.320
shall I, Odin, king of the northern gods

54:02.656 --> 54:05.324
end this world.

54:07.202 --> 54:08.994
Why would someone take an old spear

54:09.079 --> 54:10.996
when there's so much
other junk around?

54:11.331 --> 54:13.540
Don't get me wrong. It's all good junk.

54:13.833 --> 54:16.710
I'm more interested in these
scorch marks on the floor.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.879
Like lightning struck here.

54:20.632 --> 54:21.799
Obby!

54:22.092 --> 54:23.801
It cannot be the lightning.

54:24.135 --> 54:26.971
See for yourself.
There's no hole in the roof.

54:28.306 --> 54:30.516
No black powder. Not explosives.

54:30.976 --> 54:34.770
Fire did not fall from the sky in Atlantis
like it does here.

54:34.854 --> 54:36.146
I do not like it.

54:36.481 --> 54:38.774
Yeah, me neither. Mr. Whitmore,

54:39.401 --> 54:42.778
I'm thinking that it wasn't
any ordinary spear, was it?

54:42.862 --> 54:44.697
Do I own anything that's ordinary?

54:45.198 --> 54:48.534
Regardless, I do have a good idea
who took it.

54:49.494 --> 54:52.079
The man's name is Erik Hellstrom.

54:52.163 --> 54:54.581
Son of a gun was a fierce
competitor of mine.

54:54.666 --> 54:57.209
Built a shipping empire
with cruise liners.

54:57.294 --> 54:59.878
When he bought the biggest
dang castle in the old country

54:59.921 --> 55:01.630
and named it Asgard,

55:01.881 --> 55:04.300
the press dubbed him
"The Modern Odin."

55:04.718 --> 55:08.387
Yeah, he liked being treated
as a god, and he lived like one

55:08.763 --> 55:11.807
until the stock market crash
sank his company.

55:12.559 --> 55:17.229
He lost his money, his power,
and, I think, his mind.

55:17.772 --> 55:19.857
Hadn't heard from him
till he phoned last week

55:19.941 --> 55:22.526
desperately trying to convince me
to sell the spear to him.

55:22.694 --> 55:24.820
Raving about Ragnarok.

55:25.322 --> 55:27.031
What is Ragnarok?

55:27.741 --> 55:30.075
Doomsday in the old Norse myths.

55:30.285 --> 55:32.870
But why did Mr. Hellstrom
want the spear?

55:33.079 --> 55:34.496
Seems to me I remember something

55:34.581 --> 55:36.248
about a spear
in the Shepherd's Journal.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.085
- I found it. Gunokneer.
- Gesundheit.

55:40.337 --> 55:43.589
No, no. Gunokneer was the name
of an Atlantean spear.

55:44.090 --> 55:46.008
The spear Hellstrom
stole from Whitmore

55:46.092 --> 55:49.345
was the same spear,
an Atlantean spear.

55:49.596 --> 55:52.598
Weapons of Atlantis
contain untold power.

55:52.974 --> 55:56.060
If the myths are right,
that's an understatement.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.354
At Ragnarok,
the final night of the world,

55:58.438 --> 56:01.690
Odin will use the spear to summon
the forces of chaos and destruction.

56:01.941 --> 56:04.610
He's going to use the spear
to bring about Ragnarok.

56:04.944 --> 56:07.071
- Armageddon.
- Judgment Day.

56:07.113 --> 56:08.447
The end of the world.

56:10.033 --> 56:12.868
The end of Atlantis. Of everything.

56:13.536 --> 56:15.287
My father foresaw this.

56:15.330 --> 56:18.540
Your father was trying
to save his empire, Kida.

56:18.833 --> 56:21.335
This guy's just frosted
'cause he's in the poor house.

56:21.461 --> 56:23.712
Frosted.

56:25.298 --> 56:27.341
It's Iceland, you see?

56:28.760 --> 56:31.428
So if Hellstrom is going to be stopped

56:31.888 --> 56:34.306
it looks like you're going to Iceland.

56:34.599 --> 56:38.560
Why can't Ragnarok be in Miami?
You know, a nice, warm place.

56:38.812 --> 56:40.270
I'm never gonna get a tan.

56:43.650 --> 56:44.942
- Kida?
- Milo.

56:45.777 --> 56:49.655
My father knew the power of Atlantis
would be abused like this.

56:50.198 --> 56:54.118
As king, it was his responsibility
to do as he saw fit.

56:55.036 --> 56:57.204
Perhaps it is the same with Hellstrom.

56:57.455 --> 57:00.040
Yeah, but Hellstrom
gave himself this crown

57:00.333 --> 57:02.084
and he isn't trying to save anybody.

57:02.502 --> 57:04.002
And that's a big difference.

57:16.558 --> 57:20.310
We ought to be nearing Iceland.
And that name ain't just for show.

57:22.105 --> 57:24.857
With any luck,
this weather will lighten up.

57:26.943 --> 57:29.820
We should not be flying
in such a storm.

57:30.029 --> 57:33.031
We'll crash.
We are too high above the dirt.

57:33.533 --> 57:36.910
You know, the weather hasn't let up
since Hellstrom stole that spear.

57:37.370 --> 57:39.955
- I wonder if...
- Coincidence, Milo.

57:40.540 --> 57:41.790
Take over, Vinny.

57:42.876 --> 57:46.545
I mean, come on.
The old gods affecting the weather?

57:46.838 --> 57:51.175
Well, there was that Indian wind god,
spirit, whatever, Kraken.

57:51.259 --> 57:54.011
Yeah, the Kraken might have
been a god. Maybe not.

57:54.512 --> 57:55.888
Vinny!

57:58.683 --> 58:00.601
And that big Atlantis crystal,

58:00.685 --> 58:02.394
that was kind of like a god.

58:02.979 --> 58:05.731
All I'm saying,
we see a lot of strange stuff.

58:05.815 --> 58:08.150
I'm just being open-minded.

58:08.276 --> 58:10.235
Well, you let go of my plane that way

58:10.278 --> 58:13.071
and I'll toss your open mind
right into that soup.

58:13.114 --> 58:16.992
But we are over land now.
Good solid land. Yes.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.703
Relax, Mole.
We've been over Iceland for minutes.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.246
The land's as solid as...

58:22.248 --> 58:24.374
You're gonna want to take a look at this.

58:29.631 --> 58:32.466
Hellstrom's castle?
What did you call it?

58:32.800 --> 58:35.511
Asgard. Home of the gods.

58:35.803 --> 58:37.971
This is the power of the spear.

58:38.223 --> 58:40.516
That's what I call, "Home Improvement."

58:40.850 --> 58:43.560
Look out! We'll crash! We'll crash!

58:43.603 --> 58:46.480
Relax. We're not going to crash
into any mountain.

58:49.442 --> 58:50.776
Unless it stands up.

58:57.492 --> 58:59.284
You missed us.

58:59.994 --> 59:01.620
That thing could have been a god.

59:06.501 --> 59:08.794
Buckle up! We're going down!

59:35.863 --> 59:36.947
Piece of cake.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.743
My beautiful land.

59:42.662 --> 59:43.829
My lips!

59:43.913 --> 59:46.164
I am sorry for
your flying machine, Audrey.

59:46.583 --> 59:47.916
Easy come, easy go.

59:49.836 --> 59:52.504
Look at the bright side. We're alive.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.549
But we're not exactly
getting a warm welcome.

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:04.891
Maybe I'll give him a present.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.152
Great. More hocus-pocus.

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:35.047
I bid you welcome

01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:38.967
to the Hall of Odin.

01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:43.889
Listen, Mr. Hellstrom,
you've caught some bad breaks

01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:46.099
but there's no reason
to take it out on the world.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.643
I know you.

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:49.227
It's the spear.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:53.649
Its power is one of destruction.
It will destroy you... All of us.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.109
I know you.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.070
You're the trickster, Loki.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.530
You seek the power of my spear.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:02.324
- No.
- You'll not trick me.

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:11.166
Stop, Mr. Hellstrom. My lord, Odin.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.752
I know the power of your spear.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.755
The same power
almost destroyed my father.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.090
Father?

01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:24.513
Of course. Brunhilde, my daughter.
My Valkyrie.

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:28.266
You've come to rule
the new world at my side.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.311
No. I am not your daughter.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.689
But I do care about you.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:42.614
Kida!

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.868
Neither man nor god
will stop Ragnarok.

01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:49.287
I cast thee out of Asgard

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.665
to your doom.

01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.384
Do not drop me.

01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:04.469
You could lay off the éclairs, you know.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:07.973
I cannot help it. It's the crème filling.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:13.979
Mole, we need you up here.

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.106
Go away. I am praying.

01:02:16.607 --> 01:02:19.901
Mole, we got one chance.
We need you to dig.

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:22.487
- Mole stays.
- Mole!

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.781
Fine. I will come.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.993
It is always Mole
that must save the day.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:31.288
Hey, watch it.
Don't make me sorry I saved you.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.835
A good thing
that you are not any skinnier, Milo.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:39.421
Perhaps you should eat more éclairs.

01:02:40.047 --> 01:02:41.715
Get on with it.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.178
You know, I'm not used to this going up.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.681
As a digger, I dig down,
deep into the earth.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.976
See, of course you may have noticed
I am rather afraid of heights and...

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.102
Dig!

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:09.242
You see?

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.204
You are a warrior born.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.873
My Brunhilde, my daughter.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.919
I am not your daughter.

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:21.713
I am Kidagakash, queen of Atlantis.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.299
What have you done with my friends?

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:28.136
I cast them out, Brunhilde,
into the abyss below.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.429
No!

01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:31.932
It could not be helped.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:35.560
We must go, daughter.

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:39.606
The chaos lord of fire
must be awoken before sundown.

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:42.150
Today must be Ragnarok.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.986
Yes. Let us leave. Quickly.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.372
What do you see?

01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:57.874
He's using the spear
to carry them to the volcano.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:58.959
What else is out there?

01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.753
His 100 foot bodyguard.

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:04.756
And I see our only way out,
this big wooden door.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.967
If we can find a way to open it...

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.806
Just call me the doorman.

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:16.810
So we can get out,
but we still can't go anywhere.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.104
We are trapped.

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:23.900
What are we to do, ride this door
down the stairs like a ski jump?

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.949
No. No, no, no. No!

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:46.256
I believe that we should all lean.

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:50.302
Move over, Mole. I'll pilot this thing.

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.637
- Move over where?
- Everybody lean left.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.515
Mole, your other left.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.978
Roadblock!

01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:16.077
Pull me up!

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.371
No, Milo.
We could use you like a rudder.

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:40.185
Yeah, he's gonna have a limp
after that one.

01:05:50.988 --> 01:05:53.448
Hellstrom, you must listen to me.

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.033
- My father...
- Yes?

01:05:55.242 --> 01:05:57.160
No. My real father.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:06:01.206
He hid away this power
so it could not be used for destruction.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:06.544
It was to be used for love,
for life, for all that is good.

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.965
Hellstrom, stop this madness.
I beg you.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.717
Use this power to heal the world.

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:16.054
Brunhilde,
that's exactly what I intend to do.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:20.308
I, alone, am destined
to remake it and rule over it anew.

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:24.521
To begin again, I must destroy what is.

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.982
No. You cannot.

01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:28.692
Kida!

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.904
You'll not stop me, Loki.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.656
No!

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.408
Ragnarok!

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:11.609
Say your goodbyes to this world

01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:14.696
and herald in my new order.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:34.507
Even at the end, the forces of darkness
would thwart the king of the gods.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.177
You're not the king of anything,
Hellstrom.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:39.095
You're a boat builder.

01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:56.654
Shoo, birds. Shoo.

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:11.294
No!

01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:21.513
There now. Ragnarok approaches.

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:25.265
It is I, Odin, who shall stand triumphant.

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:27.519
You really think you're still in charge?

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.354
Those two are done taking orders.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:52.961
And the fire lord will set the sky ablaze.

01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:59.884
And the earth will become as ice
as a new age dawns.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.053
So, Milo, you got a plan?

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:05.098
Just thought I'd ask.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.100
Wait a second. I do have a plan.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.194
Now a little heat.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.122
It's working.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:31.541
Now they're ticked.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.844
- The spear!
- I will get it!

01:09:50.644 --> 01:09:52.854
Vinny, we need another bomb.

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:54.272
I'm fresh out.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.959
- Kida!
- I'm all right, Milo.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.340
My Asgard! My kingdom! No!

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.803
Give him a while.
Let him mourn his kingdom.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:29.140
Then we'll get him to a hospital
where maybe he can be helped.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.475
And as for that thing,

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:34.062
I'm thinking you should put it in a safe.
Like now.

01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:37.857
Maybe with some chains,
and locks, big ones.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.735
I have a better place for this spear.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.627
I learned many things from your world.

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:01.130
Most of all, I think,
I now know my father better.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:06.552
My father was only protecting us
and the world above

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.012
when he hid the heart of Atlantis.

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.640
I understand that now.

01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:13.851
Kida, you can't hide the crystal again.
I mean, it would...

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.023
Sorry. Sort of ruining
the moment there. But...

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.276
But my father was wrong.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:22.986
He thought mankind

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:25.530
would use the power of the crystal
for destruction.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.490
But look around you.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.910
The Heart of Atlantis
has let us rebuild our city.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:36.040
And I saw how the knowledge of Atlantis
touched a tribe of surface people

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.127
and made them
great healers and teachers.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.214
The brightest light is worth nothing
if hidden in a cave.

01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:46.426
I do not want the legacy of Atlantis

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:49.220
to be the destruction of its civilization.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:55.518
Let us share our light with the world.

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:45.021
What is that light, Queen Kida?
Is it a crystal?

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.564
No, child.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.775
It is the sun.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.244
I think I swallowed my gum.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.665
The world was never the same
after that day.

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:09.128
It was much, much better.
