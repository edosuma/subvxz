changes everything.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.660

There’s staining to the trabecular
of the sternum.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.452
There must have been
a lot of internal bleeding
for staining this deep.

15:21.546 --> 15:25.255
Hmm. The trauma to the posterior
aspect of the skull...

15:25.342 --> 15:26.798
shows fracturing,

15:26.885 --> 15:29.342
which reach a depth
of 10 to 14 millimeters.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.385
Which would have damaged
the cerebrocerebellum.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.088
But wouldn’t give us
cause of death.

An injury like this
would impair motor skills

is a deep initial blow...

which resulted in tapering off
to a mere scraping of the bone.

if the victim was moving
away from her assailant.

it was done, but I can’t
tie it back to Pelant.

So speak to me.
What did you find out about
the guidance counselor?

17:52.906 --> 17:56.273
Okay. In the year leading up
to her writing his letter of
recommendation to Stanford,

17:56.409 --> 18:00.698
Pelant was suspended for hacking
into the school’s computer
system to change a grade.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.405
His college recommendation
makes him out to be a saint.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.161
Pelant always likes
looking like a saint.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.460
But when you analyze
the idiolect used in this letter—

18:08.546 --> 18:11.379
Everyone I talk to today
is trying to give me
a headache.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.003
The language patterns.
You know, linguistic
variations of the author.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.050
They’re like stylistic
and psychological
fingerprints.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.718
Thank you.
Okay.

18:17.806 --> 18:21.014
So I went through some
old articles that Pelant wrote
for the school paper,

18:21.101 --> 18:22.841
an essay
he won an award for,

18:22.936 --> 18:24.767
as well as some papers
that he wrote at Stanford.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.435
They were all very clinical.

18:30.652 --> 18:33.735
on the other letters of recommendation
from the guidance counselor,

18:33.822 --> 18:36.780
I found far more descriptive
and modified linguistics.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.108
Let me guess.
But not in the recommendation
she wrote for Pelant.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.070
Pelant may be able to erase
what he wants digitally,

18:43.164 --> 18:45.291
but he doesn’t know how
to erase his writing style.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.331
So he wrote
the recommendation himself...

18:47.419 --> 18:50.206
and then killed her so he could
go to a school he wanted to?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.083

school he applied to.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.425

from being buried.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.555

19:05.645 --> 19:08.432
Well, maybe I can help him

of weapon was used.

23:28.950 --> 23:31.942
A bad man
who killed people.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.368
You’re hinting
that if I’d killed him,
I’d be bad too?

23:34.497 --> 23:37.239
Hinting?
Sweets, I’m not
the interesting part of this.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.951
Listen to me.
Pelant wanted me
to kill him.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.703
How could you tell?
I can’t explain it.
It just—

23:43.798 --> 23:46.005
He was staring in my face
while I did it,

23:46.092 --> 23:50.131
and what I read there
was, “Do it. Do it.”

23:50.221 --> 23:52.963
So you’re saying
Pelant is suicidal.

23:53.057 --> 23:56.424
I am telling you
that he was happy
that I wanted to kill him.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.885
Okay? ltjust—
It seemed like something
you should know.

23:58.980 --> 24:03.189
What I know is that you and I
need to discuss the fact that
you’re capable of murder.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.107
Not cold—blooded murder.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.186
If it’s true that Pelant
actually wanted you to kill him,

24:08.281 --> 24:10.272
that’s different
from being suicidal.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.573

valuable information.

Not really consistent

24:24.797 --> 24:28.915
They’re pretty deep.
l’ll consult with Angela,
but, uh,

24:29.010 --> 24:32.502
given the size of Pelant
at the age of 16,

24:32.597 --> 24:34.508
the weapon is probably heavier.

24:34.599 --> 24:38.012
Okay, the key will be to tie Pelant
to the murder specifically.

24:38.102 --> 24:40.093
You mean tie the weapon
to the murderer.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.021
Dr. Brennan would have done
that better too. I know.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.484
I apologize.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.903
For what?

24:50.990 --> 24:55.108
For not realizing sooner
that what you’re working
toward here—

24:55.203 --> 24:57.990

and bring her home—

24:58.081 --> 25:00.618

Coupled with the torn
cartilage on the talus
and medial malleolus,

30:52.101 --> 30:53.591
it means she was hung
upside down,

What problem?
With the weapon.
It’s not an ax.

34:29.944 --> 34:32.401
Even you can’t tell that
in a glance, Dr. Brennan.

34:32.488 --> 34:35.821
No, I can tell it
by looking at the findings
in Dr. Edison’s notebook.

34:35.908 --> 34:40.823
You figured that the weapon
was a heavily weighted object
like an ax...

34:40.913 --> 34:43.404
because Pelant was small
in high school.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.535

34:45.626 --> 34:49.744

slight of stature.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.213
Those are all digital.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.916
My father looked up
an actual paper yearbook...

34:56.011 --> 34:57.842
and found that Pelant
never appeared.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.421
Then how do you know
he was heavy?

35:00.516 --> 35:03.758
A ZOO—pound person puts
approximately 600 pounds
of pressure...

35:03.852 --> 35:05.763
on their knee joints
just by walking.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.140
Even after the weight is lost,

35:08.232 --> 35:11.190
there are lingering symptoms
of osteoarthritis...

35:11.277 --> 35:13.643
which affect gait,
carriage and posture.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.773
Pelant was fat?

35:15.864 --> 35:17.604
In the vernacular, yes.

35:17.700 --> 35:21.784
The salient point is
that the weapon 16—year—old
Christopher Pelant used...

35:21.870 --> 35:23.531
to kill Carole Morrisey...

35:23.622 --> 35:25.658
weighed significantly less
than an ax.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.787
Dr. Hodgins determined
that the weapon...

35:29.878 --> 35:31.789
was made of tamahagane,

35:31.880 --> 35:36.624
steel used in the traditional
Japanese smelting process
used to make swords.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.380
Pelant used
a Japanese sword?

35:38.470 --> 35:42.429
Dad had coffee
with Pelant’s grandfather
a couple of times.

35:42.516 --> 35:44.973
He fought in World War II,
Pacific Theater.

35:45.060 --> 35:49.144
It was common
for soldiers to bring back
souvenirs from battle.

35:49.231 --> 35:52.894
