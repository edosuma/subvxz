01:42.893 --> 01:45.693
It's done, Mr. Donovan.
The money is secure.

01:45.695 --> 01:46.763
Good.

01:47.531 --> 01:48.633
Good.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.501
Then, we can go home.

02:14.057 --> 02:16.691
- The plane is ready?
- You'll be in Dubai for dinner.

02:16.693 --> 02:19.661
Excellent.
And the Special Operations team?

02:19.663 --> 02:21.299
Contract cancelled, sir.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.300
Awesome.

02:40.616 --> 02:43.554
C'mon, c'mon!

03:24.995 --> 03:28.733
Ahmed, move! Go, go, go!

04:21.584 --> 04:22.919
Hello, boss.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.603
You should all be fucking dead!

04:38.968 --> 04:40.935
Important safety tip, Ronnie,

04:40.937 --> 04:42.973
never trust the locals
to get the job done.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.675
You should've just paid us,
you fucking dipshit.

04:45.843 --> 04:46.942
All of this for the money?

04:46.944 --> 04:49.947
Oh, we've done worse for you
over the last two years.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.682
By my calculation, you owe,

04:52.949 --> 04:55.617
- what with time and expenses...
- Aggravation.

04:55.619 --> 04:57.622
...let's just call it
a straight-up million.

04:58.021 --> 04:59.557
Fuck you!

05:03.694 --> 05:05.596
We're not here to play games.

05:06.028 --> 05:08.497
- Where's our money?
- I... I had to get it out

05:08.499 --> 05:10.098
of the country!
Feds were getting too close!

05:10.100 --> 05:11.102
You can't touch it!

05:11.567 --> 05:13.601
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- No!

05:13.603 --> 05:15.135
It's in the banks,
scattered everywhere,

05:15.137 --> 05:16.907
thousand,
small automatic deposits!

05:17.240 --> 05:19.039
U.S. bank?

05:19.041 --> 05:21.845
- U.S., Russia, Switzerland.
- Name one.

05:22.045 --> 05:24.048
A U.S. bank, name one!

05:24.247 --> 05:27.851
Unity Savings and Loan,
Chesterford, Massachusetts!

05:28.050 --> 05:29.887
Over a million,
I can help you get it!

05:30.153 --> 05:32.988
You need me. Just get me some
fucking medical attention,

05:32.990 --> 05:34.125
and we can make a deal.

05:34.524 --> 05:35.992
Or we could just do it our way?

05:37.593 --> 05:39.129
- Your way?
- The hard way.

05:39.596 --> 05:40.730
No!

06:52.069 --> 06:53.668
You!
You're under arrest!

06:53.670 --> 06:57.072
- Hey!
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

06:57.074 --> 06:59.810
Don't touch me!
I didn't do anything!

07:12.822 --> 07:13.957
We're clear.

07:14.757 --> 07:16.993
Idiot! Incompetent!

07:17.961 --> 07:19.961
I was six steps away
from arresting

07:19.963 --> 07:22.133
the biggest antiquity smuggler
in Asia!

07:23.000 --> 07:25.235
Sorry, ma'am.
Orders.

07:27.870 --> 07:28.939
Carter,

07:29.372 --> 07:31.906
if this is another
stupid security drill,

07:31.908 --> 07:33.277
I swear I'll kill you.

07:36.980 --> 07:38.115
Yes, sir.

07:39.649 --> 07:40.917
<i>Capisco.</i>

07:43.387 --> 07:44.721
<i>Si.</i>

07:47.858 --> 07:48.992
This time...

07:49.793 --> 07:50.927
I'll find them.

08:01.937 --> 08:05.276
- Major Rahimi.
- Ah, the eternal Colonel Moss.

08:06.742 --> 08:08.778
What the hell happened here?

08:09.745 --> 08:12.312
That's exactly
what we are trying to assess.

08:12.314 --> 08:15.019
We?

08:35.905 --> 08:37.107
Thank you.

08:40.043 --> 08:43.376
Our database confirms her
as Natalia Buskhova.

08:43.379 --> 08:45.379
- Hmm.
- Wanted for money laundering,

08:45.381 --> 08:47.317
drug smuggling
and arms dealing.

08:47.484 --> 08:50.787
- And who the hell are you?
- Rossi, Interpol.

08:54.857 --> 08:57.260
- Donovan.
- You know this man?

08:58.195 --> 09:00.931
CEO of a large
construction company.

09:01.331 --> 09:03.064
He'd set up local companies

09:03.066 --> 09:05.369
to bid on American
reconstruction contracts.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.672
- War profiteer.
- Mm-hmm.

09:07.870 --> 09:09.206
How much did he steal?

09:09.472 --> 09:12.976
Close to a hundred million
over the last two years.

09:15.211 --> 09:17.081
The killers targeted the front

09:17.279 --> 09:19.414
and rear car to track
their prey.

09:19.416 --> 09:20.515
They used predominantly

09:20.517 --> 09:22.119
5.56-cal.

09:22.952 --> 09:25.152
But there is evidence
of a large 50-cal

09:25.154 --> 09:28.858
sniper rifle used,
most likely American made.

09:30.393 --> 09:32.363
I suspect Donovan's own team.

09:33.964 --> 09:37.268
All ex-special forces.
They are the ones I'm chasing.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.403
Why?
What's Interpol's take in this?

09:40.836 --> 09:42.706
The failed Kabul extraction.

09:42.905 --> 09:45.973
Those men killed
the whole military team,

09:45.975 --> 09:48.979
- including one of our agents.
- So you're getting close.

09:49.513 --> 09:52.283
Donovan's running out on them,
the mercs panic.

09:52.916 --> 09:57.021
These men do not panic.
They adapt and execute.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.391
They will kill anyone
who gets in their way.

10:00.557 --> 10:01.859
Hmm.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.319
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

11:02.918 --> 11:05.088
What did I even do
to deserve this shit?

11:05.922 --> 11:07.324
I don't bother anybody.

11:07.591 --> 11:09.924
Are you serious?

11:09.926 --> 11:11.328
Yeah.

11:11.961 --> 11:13.862
- Look at this little bitch!
- Holy shit.

11:13.864 --> 11:16.363
What the fuck are you doing
in here, faggot?

11:16.365 --> 11:17.931
You know
this is the senior bathroom.

11:17.933 --> 11:19.499
No, it's not, man.
I can be here if I want to.

11:19.501 --> 11:21.536
- What did you say?
- Ah, man, get off me!

11:21.538 --> 11:23.070
I'm just using the bathroom!

11:23.072 --> 11:24.039
- Get off!
- Punch me!

11:24.041 --> 11:25.973
I'm not gonna fight you!
Get the fuck off me!

11:25.975 --> 11:27.608
I know you're not.
You're not gonna do shit,

11:27.610 --> 11:29.344
- 'cause you're a fucking pussy.
- Stop!

11:29.346 --> 11:30.978
That's why you don't have
any friends here.

11:32.349 --> 11:35.983
- Stop it! I hate you!
- Aw, don't cry.

11:35.985 --> 11:38.389
Help! Somebody help me!

11:39.154 --> 11:40.055
<i>Help! Ow,</i>

11:40.490 --> 11:42.257
- you're hurting me!
- Ow, he's hurting me.

11:42.259 --> 11:44.128
Stop! Stop!

11:44.394 --> 11:45.962
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

11:46.296 --> 11:47.364
Get off me!

11:48.365 --> 11:50.366
- Oh, dude!
- What's going on in here?

11:53.636 --> 11:55.371
Kenny, stop. Get back here!

12:10.120 --> 12:11.522
Have you seen my vest?

12:15.926 --> 12:18.596
Babe? Lisa? Babe?

12:21.664 --> 12:23.132
Where are you?

12:26.669 --> 12:30.139
- Hey, Lisa, didn't you hear me?
- Baby, don't freak out, okay?

12:31.474 --> 12:32.940
Don't tell me
to don't freak out.

12:32.942 --> 12:34.043
Don't freak out about what?

12:35.278 --> 12:36.413
I'm pregnant.

12:37.580 --> 12:38.883
No way.

12:39.282 --> 12:40.350
Yeah.

12:41.183 --> 12:43.187
I mean, I... I think so.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.286
I'll have your mom take me
to the doctor's today

12:46.288 --> 12:47.423
to make sure, but...

12:48.424 --> 12:50.458
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Yeah.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.930
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:53.495 --> 12:56.100
- Oh, my God. I love you.
- I love you, too.

13:00.235 --> 13:03.039
Eleanor, have you seen my, uh...

13:07.376 --> 13:09.612
You are a treasure.

13:10.046 --> 13:12.682
And we should be enjoying
our day together.

13:13.450 --> 13:15.583
When the man calls, you go.

13:15.585 --> 13:18.589
You could have said no.
It's our anniversary, Randy.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.589
How is my hair?

13:22.591 --> 13:25.328
You should leave the bank
and become a stand-up comedian.

13:25.528 --> 13:28.065
Then I could not spend
my nights with you.

13:28.331 --> 13:30.301
You don't spend your days
with me, either.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.101
Eleanor.

13:33.302 --> 13:35.369
It wouldn't kill you if you
were more assertive, Randy.

13:35.371 --> 13:38.605
- You do so much for that bank.
- Okay, I'll ask... No, no.

13:38.607 --> 13:40.677
I'll instruct Judy
to close up tonight.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.143
You and I can have
an early dinner.

13:43.145 --> 13:46.382
And then, together,
maybe, we can...

13:49.519 --> 13:51.688
fall asleep in front of the TV?

13:52.221 --> 13:54.357
I would like that very much.

13:56.658 --> 13:59.495
- Go, if you're going.
- I love you too.

14:08.571 --> 14:11.041
- Good morning.
- Well,

14:11.640 --> 14:13.142
good morning.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.713
Always nice to start my day
helping a pretty lady.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.584
You here to buy? Shoot?

14:22.652 --> 14:24.321
I give lessons.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.191
I'll be buying,
if you have what I need.

14:27.423 --> 14:29.994
Hmm. Well, I got a...

14:30.293 --> 14:32.395
...great selection
of ladies' weapons.

14:35.398 --> 14:39.036
They're very pretty.
But how do I know they work?

14:39.668 --> 14:42.372
Lady, I'm a combat vet.

14:43.139 --> 14:47.478
And every weapon in here
meets my exacting standards.

14:47.811 --> 14:50.080
What if I wanted something...

14:51.346 --> 14:54.183
- bigger?
- What do you have in mind?

14:55.317 --> 14:57.020
AR 15's...

14:57.687 --> 14:59.423
Benelli M4's...

15:00.222 --> 15:02.625
maybe, a 107 Barrett...

15:03.625 --> 15:05.062
grenades...

15:05.495 --> 15:08.065
a little C-4,
for old times' sake.

15:09.164 --> 15:10.800
Hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.237
Oh, Carl...

15:14.504 --> 15:16.240
you're too modest.

15:17.573 --> 15:20.109
Tre said you could fix me up.

15:20.777 --> 15:22.312
I don't know no Tre.

15:24.246 --> 15:26.750
- Are you certain?
- Yup.

15:39.394 --> 15:40.596
Mr. Fisk...

15:41.597 --> 15:43.464
If one person dies

15:43.466 --> 15:45.436
because of a weapon
you've provided...

15:46.402 --> 15:48.806
I'll make sure
you are held liable.

16:17.299 --> 16:18.701
Hey, what about the name George?

16:19.168 --> 16:21.502
- I like the name George.
- I don't think so.

16:21.504 --> 16:23.706
- Why not? George is a good name.
- You're so cute.

16:24.506 --> 16:26.542
We don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl yet.

16:26.808 --> 16:29.245
It's gonna be a boy,
I promise you that.

16:31.246 --> 16:32.582
What about Mike?

16:35.184 --> 16:37.551
Are you kidding?

16:37.553 --> 16:40.490
Thank you for coming down
here so quickly, Mrs. Ralston.

16:41.256 --> 16:43.291
You threatened to expel my son.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.528
Well, as you and Kenny
are aware,

16:45.727 --> 16:47.728
we have a zero-tolerance policy

16:47.730 --> 16:50.167
when it comes to violence
in this school.

16:50.399 --> 16:52.333
Do you have
a zero-tolerance policy

16:52.335 --> 16:55.405
when it comes to my son getting
his head shoved in the urinal?

16:55.705 --> 16:57.738
The teacher who reported
your son's attack

16:57.740 --> 16:59.442
saw no evidence of that.

17:00.275 --> 17:03.578
Look, we expect our students
to report harassment.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.884
We even have
a student protocol that says,

17:07.317 --> 17:11.188
"If a teen's being mean,
to a teacher, come clean."

17:12.320 --> 17:14.690
I'm gonna be late for my shift
at the hospital.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.426
Are you planning
to expel my son?

17:17.826 --> 17:19.826
I'd like to try and avoid that.

17:19.828 --> 17:22.231
Kenny's never been
in trouble before.

17:23.232 --> 17:25.900
Look, we have a community
outreach program,

17:25.902 --> 17:28.435
run in cooperation
with the local police force.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.571
Police?

17:29.573 --> 17:31.742
My son's not doing one of those
Scared Straight things.

17:32.575 --> 17:35.711
Try and think of this more
as a course correction.

17:36.578 --> 17:37.844
It's a ride-along.

17:37.846 --> 17:40.483
He accompanies an officer
on a routine patrol.

17:40.983 --> 17:43.352
And then, he gets
a close-up look of

17:43.586 --> 17:45.486
where bad choices can take you.

17:45.488 --> 17:47.354
An African-American boy

17:47.356 --> 17:49.393
sits in the back
of a police car all day.

17:49.592 --> 17:51.495
And that's your solution?

17:52.327 --> 17:54.530
Well, it's that or expulsion.

17:57.933 --> 18:00.336
What's wrong with naming
the baby after your dad?

18:01.671 --> 18:03.340
He doesn't deserve it.

18:05.807 --> 18:07.877
<i>My dad doesn't care
about that kind of stuff.</i>

18:08.744 --> 18:10.246
<i>Your dad loves you.</i>

18:10.646 --> 18:12.680
<i>He just doesn't know
how to express it.</i>

18:12.682 --> 18:15.485
- <i>He's had a tough year.</i>
- <i>Well, I don't care.</i>

18:15.751 --> 18:17.921
<i>He needs to learn
it's not all about him.</i>

18:19.521 --> 18:20.790
<i>He's still coming to terms.</i>

18:21.758 --> 18:23.360
<i>It happened so fast.</i>

18:23.960 --> 18:25.495
<i>Seven months?</i>

18:27.430 --> 18:29.697
<i>In a 30-year marriage.
I know to us,</i>

18:29.699 --> 18:31.701
- <i>seven months felt like...</i>
- <i>Like a lifetime?</i>

18:32.067 --> 18:34.937
Yeah, it was. Hers!

18:35.971 --> 18:38.674
He couldn't accept
the diagnosis, Lisa.

18:39.541 --> 18:40.940
Talking is not
your dad's best skill,

18:40.942 --> 18:41.912
you know that.

18:43.145 --> 18:44.647
<i>It was like talking about it
made it real for him.</i>

18:45.515 --> 18:46.814
But it was real.

18:46.816 --> 18:49.685
It was chemo and radiation
and pain.

18:49.986 --> 18:51.388
And losing her hair?

18:52.588 --> 18:55.291
God, Steve, the day she died,
he even looked surprised!

18:59.662 --> 19:02.833
Look, I married a cop.
I know the drill.

19:03.398 --> 19:05.665
You put on the badge
and the gun,

19:05.667 --> 19:07.101
and you head out the door.

19:07.103 --> 19:09.006
Not knowing
if you're coming home.

19:09.806 --> 19:11.538
And you leave us behind

19:11.540 --> 19:14.711
with a smile and little wave
and all that terror.

19:15.678 --> 19:18.482
And we suck it up.
We deal with it. We cope.

19:19.015 --> 19:21.449
But when she needed him
to do the same for her,

19:21.451 --> 19:22.618
he failed.

19:24.420 --> 19:27.356
Right till the very end,
he made her be the strong one.

19:28.857 --> 19:31.427
I'm not gonna be like that,
okay?

19:32.362 --> 19:33.960
I'm gonna be right here with you

19:33.962 --> 19:35.999
every step of the way,
with you and little Sarah.

19:37.366 --> 19:38.567
Or little Suzie.

19:40.970 --> 19:42.471
Georgina?

19:46.008 --> 19:48.612
I love you both.
You're my whole life.

19:53.482 --> 19:54.984
You're gonna be a great dad.

20:03.459 --> 20:05.461
- That's your father.
- Of course it is.

20:29.484 --> 20:31.487
Hey,
what's happening, Mike?

20:32.087 --> 20:35.024
Well, you know, same old shit.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.410
Hey, listen, you're not gonna
believe what I just found out.

21:27.676 --> 21:28.677
Is everything all right?

21:30.546 --> 21:31.948
Lisa's pregnant.

21:32.615 --> 21:33.747
- Wow!
- Yeah.

21:33.749 --> 21:35.152
Wow!

21:36.551 --> 21:38.554
- Wow. Well, that's, that's...
- Yeah.

21:39.555 --> 21:40.856
- some news.
- Mm.

21:41.557 --> 21:42.826
Oh, yeah.

21:46.828 --> 21:47.829
I'm happy for you guys.

21:50.967 --> 21:53.903
Thanks, Mike. Thank you. That...
that means a lot.

21:56.972 --> 21:59.576
Hey, you should give her a call.

22:00.910 --> 22:03.046
Just one call.
She'd love to hear from you.

22:09.251 --> 22:10.854
So how do we look?

22:11.653 --> 22:13.888
I have 1.36 million.

22:13.890 --> 22:16.590
Perfect like always.
Thank you, Judith.

22:16.592 --> 22:18.028
Thanks, Randall.

22:20.596 --> 22:23.296
Look, we open in two,
so let's keep up the good work.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.132
If you start to get low,
call me over

22:25.134 --> 22:27.200
before you run out of cash,
not after.

22:27.202 --> 22:29.138
- Got it, Randall.
- Let's have a great day.

23:30.967 --> 23:33.803
- How many 223 rounds total?
- Fifty-two hundred.

23:34.604 --> 23:35.672
It's good.

23:36.838 --> 23:39.073
More likely we won't need
to use it. Get it packed up.

23:39.075 --> 23:41.244
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

23:43.078 --> 23:45.548
Yeah, sitting here,
enjoying my coffee.

23:47.883 --> 23:49.085
Yeah.

23:49.818 --> 23:51.086
Yeah.

24:18.913 --> 24:21.151
- Here you go.
- Ah, hold on.

24:24.019 --> 24:25.989
Why don't you
keep the change, darling?

24:27.022 --> 24:28.991
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.260
Yeah, you, too.

24:35.897 --> 24:38.899
Driveway up here.
Parks the car. Main entrance.

24:38.901 --> 24:40.604
All windows face the street.

24:41.170 --> 24:42.402
Opposition?

24:42.404 --> 24:44.337
One security guard.
Inconsequential.

24:44.339 --> 24:47.009
- How about hostages?
- Half a dozen staff.

24:47.676 --> 24:49.144
Number of customers variable.

24:49.345 --> 24:51.944
Fire exit's in the same room
as the main doors.

24:51.946 --> 24:54.280
- No back way out.
- Five minutes.

24:54.282 --> 24:56.719
We handle that, we're gone
and we're rich.

24:57.153 --> 24:59.154
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

25:03.358 --> 25:05.025
<i>This is the time
to retire.</i>

25:05.027 --> 25:07.161
<i>I'm... I'm retiring
at the right time.</i>

25:07.163 --> 25:08.964
- I was a cop at the right time.
- That's right.

25:09.164 --> 25:11.800
You're gonna have a lot of crap
to deal with moving forward.

25:12.034 --> 25:13.169
- I know.
- A lot of crap.

25:14.303 --> 25:15.369
Because everyone's got a camera,
everyone's got a lawyer,

25:15.371 --> 25:18.675
and it's just... it's not...
it's not a good time.

25:25.448 --> 25:27.182
Sign here, please.

25:27.916 --> 25:29.850
So when should I be back
to pick him up?

25:29.852 --> 25:33.189
- They should be back around six.
- And this is completely safe?

25:34.089 --> 25:35.991
Yes, we do these ride-alongs
all the time.

25:36.357 --> 25:38.357
I'll make sure the officer
has your number and uh,

25:38.359 --> 25:40.195
he'll give you a call
when they're on their way back.

25:40.996 --> 25:42.462
Okay, thanks.

25:42.464 --> 25:44.967
- All right. Love you, mom.
- I love you, too.

25:58.079 --> 25:59.947
Hey, Mack? I didn't know it was

25:59.949 --> 26:01.817
Bring Your Grandpa
to Work Day.

26:02.484 --> 26:04.418
I would've brought
mine too, man.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.487
Oh, yeah? How you gonna bring
yours? He get paroled?

26:06.489 --> 26:07.955
Actually, it looks like

26:07.957 --> 26:09.957
I'm gonna be a grandfather,
after all.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.991
Can't pull out what you
can't put in, buddy.

26:11.993 --> 26:14.961
Yeah, Mack finally got
my fucking daughter pregnant.

26:14.963 --> 26:16.963
Oh, well, I guess
it could've been worse.

26:16.965 --> 26:17.797
It could've been you.

26:17.799 --> 26:19.266
Why you gotta say that, man?

26:19.268 --> 26:21.501
- 'Cause I'm black?
- No. Yes.

26:21.503 --> 26:22.905
All right.

26:23.138 --> 26:25.074
No, seriously, guys.
Congratulations.

26:31.980 --> 26:34.046
So I hear Chandler's thinking
about retiring.

26:34.048 --> 26:35.248
Never happen.

26:35.250 --> 26:37.886
- You think?
- Cops like him don't retire.

26:38.887 --> 26:41.156
- What about cops like me?
- You?

26:41.390 --> 26:44.257
You'll be cleaning your gun
one day and shoot your foot off.

26:44.259 --> 26:46.259
- Hilarious.
- Maybe your nuts.

26:46.261 --> 26:47.730
Hey, let me ask you something.

26:48.897 --> 26:50.898
You ever think about going
into comedy?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.466
You'd be amazing
with a microphone.

26:52.468 --> 26:54.000
I thought about it.

26:54.002 --> 26:56.271
But seriously,
you're a shitty shooter.

26:56.872 --> 26:58.538
It all depends
what I'm shooting at.

26:58.540 --> 27:00.306
- Oh.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

27:00.308 --> 27:01.478
Anytime.

27:02.877 --> 27:05.411
- Good morning, MacAvoy.
- Yeah, it is.

27:05.413 --> 27:07.282
- How's the new guy?
- New.

27:10.152 --> 27:11.254
"Ride-along?"

27:12.020 --> 27:13.322
What kind of shit is this?

27:21.163 --> 27:23.098
Can't believe
we've gotta do this.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.303
We all have to be
Officer Bill some days.

27:28.037 --> 27:31.341
You ready to go?

27:33.375 --> 27:37.180
- Um, yeah, I guess.
- You guess? Stand up.

27:39.582 --> 27:41.081
I hope you don't think
that this is some kind of

27:41.083 --> 27:42.481
fun adventure you can run home
and brag about

27:42.483 --> 27:44.317
to your friends,
'cause it's not, little man.

27:44.319 --> 27:45.585
You are here
'cause you fucked up,

27:45.587 --> 27:46.855
you understand?

27:48.057 --> 27:50.326
- Yeah, I understand.
- Something funny?

27:52.060 --> 27:53.160
No. I'm sorry.

27:53.162 --> 27:55.130
Then you better wipe
that goofy smirk off your face.

27:59.201 --> 28:01.403
All right.
Walk over to the front door.

28:01.936 --> 28:03.372
Stop when you get to it.

28:17.619 --> 28:19.254
<i>23-Paul-01,</i>

28:19.520 --> 28:20.719
<i>we have a 4-88 report.</i>

28:20.721 --> 28:24.961
<i>21560 Abraham Street.
White male, mid-30's.</i>

28:25.160 --> 28:27.964
23-Paul-1, copy. In route.

28:33.635 --> 28:35.838
It's time. Load up.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.563
<i>23-Paul-1.
We're 97 and out</i>

29:03.565 --> 29:05.532
with a possible petty
theft subject.

29:05.534 --> 29:07.337
<i>Copy that, 23-Paul-1.</i>

29:08.537 --> 29:11.540
Hey, stay where you are.
Stand up!

29:12.674 --> 29:14.277
Put your hands in the air.

29:16.144 --> 29:17.480
<i>Let me see your hands.</i>

29:19.682 --> 29:21.617
I said put your hands up!

29:22.084 --> 29:23.717
- Do it now!
- What did I do, man?

29:23.719 --> 29:25.052
That's what we're gonna
find out.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.624
- <i>Just do what he tells you.</i>
- Hands behind the head!

29:28.289 --> 29:30.457
Interlace the fingers!
Spread your legs.

29:30.459 --> 29:32.025
I don't understand.
I didn't do anything wrong.

29:32.027 --> 29:33.296
Spread your fucking legs.

29:33.729 --> 29:35.161
You got anything sharp
in those pockets?

29:35.163 --> 29:36.963
- Any needles gonna poke me, huh?
- No, man.

29:36.965 --> 29:38.164
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.301
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:41.436 --> 29:42.568
I'm gonna get
the clerk's statement.

29:42.570 --> 29:43.402
Copy that.

29:43.404 --> 29:45.074
- So can I go, man?
- No.

29:51.246 --> 29:53.212
That guy always comes
around here,

29:53.214 --> 29:55.250
begging for money
and stuff, right?

29:55.718 --> 29:58.354
The guy walks out
with a carton of cigarettes.

30:07.462 --> 30:09.062
Okay, we're a couple
of blocks out.

30:09.064 --> 30:10.133
Let's go through it.

30:10.465 --> 30:11.667
I park us out front,

30:12.201 --> 30:13.600
keep my eyes open
for any heroes.

30:13.602 --> 30:16.103
I'm first through the door
and over the barrier.

30:16.105 --> 30:18.270
I'm in second with the bags.

30:18.272 --> 30:20.640
I'm third through the door.
I handle crowd control.

30:20.642 --> 30:22.241
Take the safe key,
open the safe.

30:22.243 --> 30:23.642
Luke, you load the bags.

30:23.644 --> 30:25.746
- I take the first bag.
- I take the second bag.

30:25.748 --> 30:27.413
Everyone back in the vehicle.

30:27.415 --> 30:29.482
That's when we drive away
slo-mo, brothers.

30:29.484 --> 30:32.087
In and out.
Five minutes max, guys.

30:32.621 --> 30:34.621
- Am I being arrested?
- Not yet.

30:34.623 --> 30:36.225
I'll tell you if you are.

30:39.361 --> 30:40.630
Is this your bag?

30:42.096 --> 30:44.500
- Is it or isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.132
You mind if I search it?

30:46.134 --> 30:47.436
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

30:59.781 --> 31:02.114
23-Paul-1, we have one
in custody.

31:02.116 --> 31:03.517
Can you roll us
a transport unit?

31:03.519 --> 31:04.988
I have a rider and no cage.

33:12.647 --> 33:14.416
- Come on!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

33:15.416 --> 33:16.651
Come on!

33:17.251 --> 33:18.453
Come on!

33:19.587 --> 33:21.688
- Everybody, get down!
- Get the fuck down!

33:21.690 --> 33:24.524
Calm down! Calm down!

33:24.526 --> 33:25.894
- Get down!
- Calm down! Calm down!

33:26.394 --> 33:27.794
Get the fuck down!

33:27.796 --> 33:30.830
Don't move! Don't...
don't fucking move!

33:30.832 --> 33:31.898
Any fucking heroes,

33:31.900 --> 33:33.136
I'll take your fucking heads
off!

33:34.369 --> 33:35.201
Open the fucking door before
I shoot your fucking head off!

33:35.203 --> 33:36.336
Oh, yeah.

33:36.338 --> 33:39.439
Well done, well done,
well done, well done, well done.

33:39.441 --> 33:41.744
Everybody out right now!
You, too! Out!

33:46.280 --> 33:48.283
Open the fucking vault.

33:50.853 --> 33:52.822
Open the fucking safe.
Open it! Come on!

33:54.489 --> 33:55.557
Come on!

34:01.496 --> 34:02.832
All right.
Get the fuck out of the way.

34:04.365 --> 34:05.864
You got one minute
to pack up the cash.

34:05.866 --> 34:07.234
You know me, bro.
I got this.

34:07.236 --> 34:08.737
- Get it done! Come on!
- I will!

34:14.342 --> 34:15.440
Okay, listen up,
everybody!

34:15.443 --> 34:18.311
I want to see everyone's phone
on the ground, now!

34:18.313 --> 34:20.347
Get it done!
Put all the phones in this!

34:20.349 --> 34:21.581
Come on!

34:21.583 --> 34:23.219
Out, out, out with your phones!

34:24.353 --> 34:27.856
Go, go, go! Do it now!
Go, go, go, go, go.

34:28.922 --> 34:30.789
Everybody! You, too!

34:30.791 --> 34:34.197
Get the phone out,
now! Come on, faster! Go!

34:46.007 --> 34:47.909
I'll be right back.

34:57.018 --> 34:58.353
Hey, brothers...

34:59.454 --> 35:01.920
why don't you, uh, keep it cool
in there for a minute.

35:01.922 --> 35:04.759
<i>Looks like we got some
County blues making a donut run.</i>

35:09.764 --> 35:13.235
- Rob! What's going on?
- Local police are here.

35:15.903 --> 35:17.670
<i>Hands behind the head!</i>

35:17.672 --> 35:18.907
<i>Interlace the fingers!</i>

35:20.074 --> 35:20.675
- <i>Spread your legs.</i>
- <i>I don't understand.</i>

35:22.010 --> 35:23.846
- <i>I didn't do anything wrong.</i>
- Will you shut that thing off?

35:25.914 --> 35:28.648
My mom tells me to keep in on,
just in case of an emergency.

35:28.650 --> 35:31.653
I'm here in case
of an emergency. Give it to me.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.523
- You can't just take my phone.
- I'm not taking it.

35:37.793 --> 35:39.092
Everywhere I go these days,

35:39.094 --> 35:41.931
I've got a goddamn camera
in my face.

35:42.664 --> 35:44.567
You can have it back
when I drop you off.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.398
You're just mad 'cause
you can't go around

35:46.400 --> 35:48.703
- beating up anybody anymore.
- Yeah.

35:48.936 --> 35:50.272
You're one to talk.

35:51.407 --> 35:53.342
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Means I read your file.

35:53.708 --> 35:54.609
Battery?

35:55.476 --> 35:57.779
- Yeah.
- That's a pretty serious charge.

35:58.813 --> 36:01.449
I mean, I guess
I did hurt someone, but...

36:02.818 --> 36:04.020
it's a long story.

36:09.724 --> 36:11.427
You don't look like a tough guy.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.796
What is it?
What, you just like to fight?

36:15.429 --> 36:17.565
No... not at all.

36:19.367 --> 36:20.568
I just get bullied.

36:22.103 --> 36:24.472
Get choked out, punched, kicked,

36:24.840 --> 36:26.042
pushed against a wall.

36:28.110 --> 36:29.745
It just keeps getting worse.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.448
But you hurt another kid. Why?

36:33.648 --> 36:36.052
I mean, he pushed me
into the toilet, so...

36:37.018 --> 36:38.487
I just closed my eyes and swung.

36:42.791 --> 36:44.593
Yeah, I would've done
the same thing.

36:46.994 --> 36:49.331
Why do you think these assholes
are bullying you?

36:50.998 --> 36:52.367
I don't know.

36:53.467 --> 36:54.736
Guess 'cause I'm different.

36:55.737 --> 36:57.340
They want me to change, but...

36:58.539 --> 36:59.742
I can't.

37:00.876 --> 37:02.345
What about your friends?

37:02.610 --> 37:04.413
Don't you have anybody
who'll stick up for you?

37:06.547 --> 37:07.949
I don't have any friends.

37:10.552 --> 37:12.488
Well, no one's gonna pick
on you today.

37:13.487 --> 37:14.954
I'll make sure of it.

37:14.956 --> 37:16.392
Sounds good.

37:18.927 --> 37:20.363
Here you go.

37:29.637 --> 37:31.037
- Hey, Mack.
- Hmm?

37:31.039 --> 37:32.842
Look at that Escalade
in front of the bank.

37:34.842 --> 37:36.111
It's parked in the red.

37:50.125 --> 37:52.394
We have a couple
of overachievers here.

38:00.534 --> 38:03.536
23-Paul-1, we're gonna be out
with a black Cadillac Escalade.

38:07.842 --> 38:10.879
Let's give them something else
to worry about. Hyde.

38:12.112 --> 38:13.548
<i>Make the call.</i>

38:14.548 --> 38:16.117
- Enjoy, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

38:18.753 --> 38:20.890
- I'm gonna go for a smoke.
- Okay.

38:30.965 --> 38:32.434
Let's do this.

38:48.849 --> 38:50.118
Do you see the plate?

38:53.054 --> 38:54.590
Almost.

38:56.257 --> 38:57.724
<i>All units, explosion</i>

38:57.726 --> 38:59.992
<i>at 10-33 Cranberry Boulevard.</i>

38:59.994 --> 39:03.028
<i>Possible terrorist activity.
All units respond.</i>

39:12.206 --> 39:13.509
Fuck!

39:13.974 --> 39:15.074
Do we go?

39:15.076 --> 39:16.478
Not with the kid
riding along.

39:17.012 --> 39:19.014
We'll stay on
Mr. Parking Violation.

39:24.152 --> 39:26.755
- They're not going for it.
- Give them a minute.

39:28.289 --> 39:29.958
Hyde, stay frosty.

39:36.565 --> 39:38.767
You're gonna help my friend
bag up the cash.

39:45.806 --> 39:47.642
- Jacobs!
- Take it.

39:47.976 --> 39:49.943
I'm a shitty marksman,
remember?

39:49.945 --> 39:52.912
- Just don't shoot me in the ass.
- Copy that.

39:52.914 --> 39:54.646
I want a four-block perimeter,

39:54.648 --> 39:56.918
FOP the lot behind
Willard Automotive.

39:57.117 --> 39:59.822
Keep sharp for
secondary bombers. Let's go!

40:10.599 --> 40:12.932
<i>Gangway, let emergency personnel</i>

40:12.934 --> 40:14.637
<i>get in there and do their job.</i>

40:15.003 --> 40:16.071
<i>Once again,</i>

40:17.338 --> 40:18.503
<i>a terrible explosion.
Now, we have confirmation...</i>

40:18.505 --> 40:21.609
Okay, listen up. We need
to clear the ER for incoming.

40:21.809 --> 40:23.275
The snifflers, stomach aches,

40:23.277 --> 40:24.943
broken bones get sent
to County.

40:24.945 --> 40:26.949
I need all triage teams
standing by.

40:27.248 --> 40:29.081
- Dr. Metcalf.
- On it.

40:29.083 --> 40:30.885
All elective surgeries
will be cancelled.

40:31.152 --> 40:34.387
Linda, alert burn unit.
Anybody not prepping

40:34.389 --> 40:36.889
is donating blood.
Let's move, people! Now!

40:36.891 --> 40:39.628
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

40:40.829 --> 40:42.362
<i>...now,
still being dispersed...</i>

40:48.836 --> 40:50.105
<i>...uh, it can't be confirmed...</i>

40:54.708 --> 40:55.777
<i>Breaking news. We have</i>

40:57.079 --> 40:58.211
<i>just received information,
a devastating explosion</i>

40:58.213 --> 41:00.746
<i>has just rocked the city
of Chesterford.</i>

41:00.748 --> 41:02.782
<i>Eight people
are reportedly dead,</i>

41:02.784 --> 41:04.052
<i>with scores more injured.</i>

41:05.521 --> 41:06.889
<i>Although reports of casualties
are now just still coming in,</i>

41:08.257 --> 41:10.188
<i>the death toll is expected
to rise. We will, of course...</i>

41:10.190 --> 41:13.194
GPS. New destination.
Chesterford.

41:13.661 --> 41:17.265
<i>Recalculating route.
Exit 16.</i>

41:17.666 --> 41:19.934
<i>Turn right at Deeter Avenue.</i>

41:47.161 --> 41:49.030
All right, gentlemen,
let's keep it secure.

41:49.230 --> 41:51.296
I want snipers on all roofs.
Go.

41:51.298 --> 41:54.068
And get me intel on who, what,
when and why this happened.

41:54.768 --> 41:56.037
Captain Horst!

41:57.838 --> 41:59.771
The waitress was outside
having a smoke.

41:59.773 --> 42:02.708
She says no one walked in.
The explosion came from inside.

42:02.710 --> 42:03.911
Does anyone else confirm that?

42:22.864 --> 42:25.800
Kenny, get down!

42:26.333 --> 42:27.935
Back up! Back up! Go, go, go!

42:29.070 --> 42:30.972
Kenny, stay down on the floor!

42:34.208 --> 42:36.108
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Code 9!

42:36.110 --> 42:38.244
<i>We have officers in need
of assistance! Shots fired!</i>

42:38.246 --> 42:39.948
- That's MacAvoy.
- Go.

42:40.248 --> 42:41.983
We'll finish our sweep
and catch up.

42:43.251 --> 42:46.284
Yo, what the fuck, Tre?
The hell's going on out there?

42:46.286 --> 42:49.956
Stay with the plan, Luke!
Rob, what's going on?

42:49.958 --> 42:51.226
Hyde's lighting them up.

42:52.092 --> 42:54.028
Oh, my God!

43:13.014 --> 43:15.380
Get on the ground!
Put your heads down!

43:15.382 --> 43:17.752
We're not here
to play any games!

43:23.458 --> 43:26.394
Kenny! Stay down on the floor
and cover your head!

43:32.132 --> 43:34.268
Fuck! Chandler! Fuck.

43:41.141 --> 43:43.010
Chandler! My seat belt's stuck!

43:48.882 --> 43:50.416
One suspect
with an automatic weapon

43:50.418 --> 43:51.818
outside National Bank!

43:51.820 --> 43:53.756
It's a possible 2-11
in progress!

44:00.094 --> 44:01.329
What should we do?

44:02.329 --> 44:04.032
Get everyone in the office.

44:04.898 --> 44:06.034
Hey.

44:07.135 --> 44:08.300
You're gonna show my partner
where your office is.

44:08.302 --> 44:12.106
You already have the money.
Why don't you just leave?

44:12.974 --> 44:14.943
None of these people have done
anything to you.

44:15.309 --> 44:16.344
I said,

44:17.445 --> 44:19.781
you're gonna show my partner
where your office is.

44:21.048 --> 44:23.818
He can't breathe!
Let him go!

44:27.188 --> 44:29.858
You. Get up. Get up, bitch!
Get up!

44:31.226 --> 44:34.329
You feel like talking?
Shut the fuck up! Shut the...

44:56.550 --> 44:58.353
Stay down, okay!
Just stay down!

45:05.159 --> 45:06.961
Dammit, the shooter's
coming this way!

45:27.148 --> 45:29.585
- Stay down, Kenny!
- What are you going to do now?

45:37.257 --> 45:39.994
- Guys, don't leave me here!
- No one's leaving you!

45:45.532 --> 45:47.266
Chandler, there's another
shooter in the doorway!

45:47.268 --> 45:49.605
- He's got a hostage!
- I can't see it from here!

45:56.043 --> 45:59.679
Now, y'all gonna sit down,
face the wall, Indian style.

45:59.681 --> 46:01.148
Sit down, fat man!

46:01.548 --> 46:03.951
Come on now, let's go!
Make it quick!

46:06.353 --> 46:07.622
Get in there!

46:08.289 --> 46:09.291
Let's go.

46:25.340 --> 46:27.373
<i>Help! Help! Get me
out of here, please! Help!</i>

46:27.375 --> 46:31.077
Mack! Back door's jammed!
Get Kenny out of the car!

46:31.079 --> 46:32.080
Help!

46:40.755 --> 46:43.125
Come on! Come on!

46:44.358 --> 46:46.124
Stay down! Stay down! You hurt?

46:46.126 --> 46:47.596
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

46:48.730 --> 46:52.063
- Mack, you got Kenny?
- Yeah, he's right here!

46:52.065 --> 46:53.733
Can you come around
to this side?

46:53.735 --> 46:56.369
Yeah, I think so.
We're coming now! Listen to me.

46:56.371 --> 46:58.204
You keep your head down
and get down!

46:58.206 --> 46:59.374
You run
as fast as you can, okay?

47:02.677 --> 47:04.211
Go, go, go, go!

47:07.347 --> 47:08.616
Ah!

47:34.175 --> 47:35.377
No, ah!

48:01.268 --> 48:03.269
Ah, fuck! I got shot!

48:03.271 --> 48:04.706
- Where?
- I got shot!

48:15.148 --> 48:17.085
Ah! Fuck!

48:17.351 --> 48:20.021
Fuck!

48:24.092 --> 48:25.494
He fucking shot me!

48:27.195 --> 48:29.297
23-Paul-1,
I have an officer down.

48:29.563 --> 48:31.764
- Repeat, officer down.
- I'm hit, Mike!

48:31.766 --> 48:33.331
- I'm fucking hit, man!
- Just hang on, man!

48:33.333 --> 48:35.166
- I'm hit!
- I'm just trying to get the...

48:35.168 --> 48:36.771
get the med kit! Hang on!

48:51.485 --> 48:54.188
Stay with me, Mack.
It's only a scratch.

48:56.324 --> 48:58.657
I'm bleeding out, Mike.
Mike, I'm bleeding out.

48:58.659 --> 49:00.659
- List... I'm gonna die today.
- No, listen!

49:00.661 --> 49:02.193
You just listen to me!

49:02.195 --> 49:05.366
You hold on!
You are not dying today!

49:05.599 --> 49:08.335
All right? Kenny, come here.

49:08.603 --> 49:10.401
I need you to keep pressure
on that wound.

49:10.403 --> 49:12.606
Just twist it. Just like that.
Just twist it really tight.

49:13.907 --> 49:15.610
Ah, yeah.

49:19.746 --> 49:21.750
You're doing great.

49:28.356 --> 49:30.759
- Everybody get down!
- Come on, come on, come on!

49:31.791 --> 49:33.291
- Hey.
- Hmm?

49:33.293 --> 49:34.626
Forget about that for now.

49:34.628 --> 49:36.394
They're gonna set
a perimeter on us soon.

49:36.396 --> 49:38.365
- We're going out the front?
- I don't think so.

49:38.766 --> 49:41.266
Time to change the plan.
Grab the Zytec.

49:41.268 --> 49:42.503
Ah, it's party time.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.583
Here. Right here.

50:00.922 --> 50:02.389
We're gonna take care of you,
ma'am.

50:02.690 --> 50:04.559
Suzie, get orthopedic
down here.

50:04.958 --> 50:06.527
- I'm on it.
- Shawnie.

50:06.793 --> 50:08.394
- Yes.
- Get ready for more incoming.

50:08.396 --> 50:09.662
Oh, my God. Not another bomb.

50:09.664 --> 50:11.666
No, bank robbery,
multiple gunshot victims.

50:11.965 --> 50:13.400
What?

50:22.210 --> 50:23.976
Yeah, I got four snipers
on the roofs.

50:23.978 --> 50:26.615
- Perimeter's secure.
- Okay. Copy that 10-4.

50:27.315 --> 50:28.617
Captain Horst?

50:29.550 --> 50:30.818
Rossi, Interpol.

50:31.284 --> 50:33.318
This is really not
a good time, Ms. Rossi.

50:33.320 --> 50:34.820
I'm kind of busy right now,
okay?

50:34.822 --> 50:36.458
I believe we can assist
each other.

50:36.757 --> 50:38.557
- Really?
- I found this,

50:38.559 --> 50:40.458
in a warehouse
outside of town

50:40.460 --> 50:43.831
- as part of my investigation.
- C-4. Where'd you get this?

50:45.365 --> 50:46.601
Here's the address.

50:48.436 --> 50:50.001
Okay, now you got
my attention.

50:50.003 --> 50:51.970
Just don't go wandering off
anywhere, okay?

50:51.972 --> 50:53.375
May I look around?

50:54.641 --> 50:57.443
Sure. Just please do me
a favor and don't...

50:57.445 --> 50:59.010
- Do not touch anything.
- Yeah.

50:59.012 --> 51:00.715
And you know what,
you can start with,

51:01.315 --> 51:03.449
the waitress. She's over there
by the ambulance.

51:03.451 --> 51:04.786
I think she might be helpful.

51:05.885 --> 51:07.322
Thank you.

51:24.505 --> 51:25.673
Thank you.

51:27.007 --> 51:28.809
Have you seen
any of these men?

51:38.485 --> 51:42.389
Him. He was here this morning.
He left a really big tip.

51:44.824 --> 51:46.227
Thank you.

52:00.974 --> 52:02.677
That's right, Kenny. Real tight.

52:04.644 --> 52:05.646
Mike...

52:06.380 --> 52:07.646
I'm stone-cold, man.

52:07.648 --> 52:09.782
I can feel I'm going
into hypovolemic shock.

52:09.784 --> 52:12.686
- I can feel it.
- Mack. Mack!

52:13.586 --> 52:15.320
Medical, I need someone
out here now!

52:15.322 --> 52:17.655
I'm cold, man. I can feel it.
I'm going cold.

52:17.657 --> 52:19.657
If you fucking die on me,
I'll fucking kill you!

52:19.659 --> 52:22.427
Kenny, twist it tight!
Press down hard!

52:22.429 --> 52:23.931
- You got this?
- Yeah.

52:32.940 --> 52:34.409
Going hot.

52:36.344 --> 52:37.545
Sending!

52:48.088 --> 52:49.690
We're almost out of this,
Mack.

52:53.094 --> 52:56.431
Kenny, stay sharp.
You're doing great.

52:58.099 --> 52:59.965
Delaney, we gotta
press forward, man!

52:59.967 --> 53:01.336
We can't stay here!

53:08.141 --> 53:09.710
You're gonna be okay.

53:14.114 --> 53:15.482
Bull's-eye!

53:23.791 --> 53:27.461
MacAvoy. MacAvoy!
MacAvoy!

53:27.862 --> 53:29.927
I'm not doing good, Kenny.
I'm not doing good.

53:29.929 --> 53:31.532
No, you cannot die!

53:32.800 --> 53:34.869
Wake up! Stay with me!

53:36.137 --> 53:38.472
You can't go. You can't go!

53:38.806 --> 53:41.342
You can't go.

54:01.628 --> 54:02.764
Sniper!

54:03.630 --> 54:05.666
Office down! Officer down!

54:24.784 --> 54:27.654
<i>...emergency
personnel are now on the scene.</i>

54:29.456 --> 54:31.425
Wake up! Wake up!

54:32.059 --> 54:33.795
What do you want me to do?
I don't know how to help.

54:34.061 --> 54:35.663
MacAvoy, wake up!

54:36.163 --> 54:37.532
Stay with me!

54:41.135 --> 54:42.570
I wish you...

54:43.536 --> 54:45.072
to record me on your phone.

54:47.106 --> 54:48.942
- Right now?
- Yeah.

54:49.809 --> 54:51.813
And I want you to make
a video of me...

54:52.746 --> 54:54.014
on your phone, right now.

54:55.148 --> 54:57.684
- A video...
- Yeah, just do it, Ken.

54:59.085 --> 55:00.421
Just do it.

55:01.889 --> 55:03.024
It's recording.

55:07.561 --> 55:08.630
Honey.

55:11.264 --> 55:12.800
Something bad happened and...

55:13.833 --> 55:16.003
<i>I know I promise you
every morning that</i>

55:16.269 --> 55:17.605
I'll be safe and...

55:18.672 --> 55:20.974
I'll make it back to you,
back home safely, but...

55:21.509 --> 55:23.577
<i>I can't keep that promise
today.</i>

55:26.914 --> 55:29.050
I really didn't think
I'd go out like this.

55:31.985 --> 55:33.587
<i>I just wanna say...</i>

55:35.989 --> 55:37.157
<i>that I love you.</i>

55:44.731 --> 55:46.134
And I love our baby.

55:49.869 --> 55:51.072
Hey, kiddo...

55:52.072 --> 55:53.208
I'm your dad.

55:54.309 --> 55:55.877
<i>I'm sorry I'm such a mess
right now...</i>

55:57.077 --> 55:59.079
<i>and I'm sorry I'm not there
for you. It's...</i>

56:00.146 --> 56:01.548
<i>it's not fair.</i>

56:02.815 --> 56:04.485
<i>And life's tough, so...</i>

56:05.286 --> 56:07.151
<i>you have to be twice as strong
for your dad, okay?</i>

56:07.153 --> 56:08.655
'Cause I can't protect you.

56:09.155 --> 56:10.891
But I will always be your dad.

56:12.626 --> 56:15.763
Turn it off.

56:21.902 --> 56:24.972
Come here!
Listen to me. Listen.

56:56.336 --> 56:58.539
<i>Hey, this is Steve.
I'm not here right now.</i>

57:02.208 --> 57:04.278
Pick up, baby,
come on, come on.

57:06.246 --> 57:07.845
<i>Hey, this is Steve.
I'm not here right now.</i>

57:07.847 --> 57:09.250
<i>So leave a...</i>

57:17.690 --> 57:20.224
Hanson, I gotta get to 23!
I gotta get to Chandler!

57:20.226 --> 57:21.693
I'm gonna keep firing!

57:21.695 --> 57:23.362
Where's medical?
This is bullshit!

57:23.364 --> 57:24.963
- I can hear them coming!
- Stay low.

57:24.965 --> 57:26.768
- Where's he hit?
- In the chest!

57:27.266 --> 57:29.101
- It went through his vest?
- Yes, straight through.

57:29.103 --> 57:30.901
- You gotta cover me!
- Cover! 10-4!

57:30.903 --> 57:33.639
- At three, I'm gonna move!
- Move, move, move!

57:33.641 --> 57:35.643
- Move! Move!
- Move, move, move! Let's go!

57:39.246 --> 57:40.882
Come on, take cover!

57:52.393 --> 57:55.262
- Ah, shit!
- He's... he's gone!

57:56.262 --> 57:57.598
He's gone!

57:58.297 --> 58:00.398
Come on, he's gone!
Let's get out of here!

58:00.400 --> 58:01.868
Let's go! Move!

58:13.079 --> 58:16.180
Mack, my man. You're gonna
be fine, Mack, okay? All right?

58:16.182 --> 58:17.818
- Hanson, Hanson...
- You're gonna be fine.

58:21.889 --> 58:24.626
- I need another mag!
- I'm on my last one!

58:24.925 --> 58:28.693
We're moving!
On three, two, one! Get up!

58:28.695 --> 58:31.162
Go! Let's go! Come on!

58:31.164 --> 58:33.166
Jacobs, we're moving!
Lay down cover fire!

58:33.434 --> 58:36.037
- I got him.
- Let's go! Go, go!

58:37.036 --> 58:38.839
- Come on, keep going!
- Come on!

59:04.197 --> 59:05.932
Move, move, move, move!

59:26.353 --> 59:28.356
- Move! Let's go!
- Move, move, move!

59:29.856 --> 59:32.360
Snap! Come on!
We're gonna lay him right here.

59:33.092 --> 59:35.696
Be careful with him.
He's hit in the leg.

59:39.032 --> 59:40.831
No sign of vitals.
Give me four units of O-neg.

59:40.833 --> 59:42.833
- We gotta move him now.
- Hell, I'm going to get Jacobs.

59:42.835 --> 59:43.971
All right, I'll be back!

59:46.273 --> 59:48.041
I got you! I got you!

59:51.010 --> 59:53.411
Come on! Come on!
Just hang in there!

59:53.413 --> 59:55.382
Those motherfuckers!

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.099
Until SWAT gets here,

01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:17.871
we're gonna lock this area down
so no one else dies today.

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:20.539
- You with me?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:22.143
- Where's Kenny?
- Who?

01:00:22.909 --> 01:00:25.010
The kid! My ride-along.

01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:26.211
He was with Jacobs.
Where is he?

01:00:26.213 --> 01:00:27.412
- We gotta find him.
- All right, all right.

01:00:27.414 --> 01:00:29.947
You guys go find the kid.
I'm gonna lock this place down.

01:00:29.949 --> 01:00:32.018
- All right. Copy.
- Come on, let's move.

01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:36.423
We're gonna have to wait
for dark. Move back!

01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:41.329
You guys have a...
have a teenager?

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:43.427
A teenager? I don't think so.

01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:57.911
- Hello?
- <i>Dad?</i>

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:03.851
Lisa...

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:07.355
<i>They're taking him
to St. Luke's. Honey, I...</i>

01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:09.490
It doesn't look good.

01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:14.361
I'm sorry.

01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:52.898
Gunshot wound to the leg.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.535
We already shocked him twice
on the way.

01:01:55.501 --> 01:01:58.172
Trauma one. Right here.

01:02:03.911 --> 01:02:06.414
Excuse me? Scalpel.

01:02:32.438 --> 01:02:34.407
- Ma'am, you can't...
- That's my husband.

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:36.340
- Steve!
- Ma'am, you gotta leave.

01:02:36.342 --> 01:02:38.478
I'm not going anywhere!
This is my husband!

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:40.447
- Let us do our job! Ma'am!
- I'm here, baby.

01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:42.149
I'm here.

01:02:42.682 --> 01:02:44.018
We're both here.

01:02:55.329 --> 01:02:58.298
Gunshot. Looks like
a clear exit wound.

01:03:00.634 --> 01:03:04.105
- Jacobs? Jacobs, what happened?
- Not now.

01:03:05.605 --> 01:03:08.108
Mike and Steve stumbled
on a bank job.

01:03:08.608 --> 01:03:11.512
Those motherfuckers
have more firepower than the...

01:03:12.378 --> 01:03:14.447
- than the devil.
- Doc,

01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:16.583
the dressing was plugging
the wound.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:18.483
I gotta see it to fix it.

01:03:18.485 --> 01:03:20.354
Jacobs, is my dad
still at the scene?

01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:22.590
Probably looking for the kid.

01:03:23.623 --> 01:03:24.625
What kid?

01:03:26.492 --> 01:03:27.628
Ride-along.

01:03:28.195 --> 01:03:30.128
Mike and Steve had a ride-along.

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:32.233
That's my baby. That's Kenny.

01:04:00.226 --> 01:04:02.329
That's him! That's his ring!
That's his ring!

01:04:02.561 --> 01:04:03.998
Here.

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:09.503
Yes, baby, it's...

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:12.405
it's me. I'm here. I'm here,
Kenny. Where are you?

01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:15.376
I'm in this parking lot.
I'm in this car by the bank.

01:04:16.108 --> 01:04:17.508
They're robbing the bank.
They're shooting people.

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:20.311
I know, honey. I know.
Are... are you safe?

01:04:20.313 --> 01:04:22.516
I don't know. I think
I should be good where I am.

01:04:22.715 --> 01:04:24.652
Okay. Listen, listen.

01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:26.586
Don't move, okay?

01:04:26.786 --> 01:04:29.119
Don't move until the police
or somebody safe

01:04:29.121 --> 01:04:31.458
- comes to get you, okay?
- Mom, I'm scared.

01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:33.391
I know, baby.

01:04:33.393 --> 01:04:35.463
I know, but we're gonna
get through this, okay?

01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:37.564
You and me,
we're gonna get through this.

01:04:37.797 --> 01:04:40.432
You're gonna be tough.
I'm gonna be tough.

01:04:40.434 --> 01:04:42.266
And you're my tough guy, okay?

01:04:42.268 --> 01:04:45.070
Mom, my phone is gonna go off.

01:04:45.072 --> 01:04:48.273
Okay. You stay there, hear me?

01:04:48.275 --> 01:04:50.809
Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:53.311
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:04:53.313 --> 01:04:55.016
Mom?

01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:56.750
Mom?

01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:04.759
Hello? He's...

01:05:05.358 --> 01:05:06.494
he's gone.

01:05:07.226 --> 01:05:08.495
My boy.

01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:49.469
<i>Gentlemen,
what's the status?</i>

01:05:50.369 --> 01:05:53.371
Lieutenant, my partner,
Officer MacAvoy and I,

01:05:53.373 --> 01:05:54.809
were first on the scene.

01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:57.876
We pulled up at approximately
ten hundred hours,

01:05:57.878 --> 01:06:00.345
and immediately witnessed
a black Escalade

01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:02.115
running curbside about 50 yards

01:06:02.615 --> 01:06:04.117
from the entrance to the bank.

01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:07.822
There was a white male
seated behind the wheel.

01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:10.487
Did you notice
any of the suspects entering

01:06:10.489 --> 01:06:12.490
- or exiting the bank?
- No, sir.

01:06:12.492 --> 01:06:14.925
At the moment, we were focused
on the vehicle and the driver,

01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:17.362
but just as we came to a stop,

01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:19.229
the driver stepped out
of the Escalade

01:06:19.231 --> 01:06:21.367
with a fully automatic
assault rifle...

01:06:22.434 --> 01:06:23.770
and that is when...

01:06:25.672 --> 01:06:27.307
we... we began...

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:30.510
taking incoming fire and my...

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.684
partner was hit.

01:06:37.817 --> 01:06:39.516
No other passengers
in your vehicle?

01:06:39.518 --> 01:06:42.689
Uh, yes, sir. Yes, we had
one ride-along in... in the back.

01:06:42.922 --> 01:06:44.524
You had a ride-along
in the back?

01:06:45.391 --> 01:06:46.659
Well, where's
the ride-along now?

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.892
Where's the ride-along now?

01:06:47.894 --> 01:06:50.597
I don't know where
the ride-along is, sir.

01:06:51.931 --> 01:06:53.666
What took you so long?

01:06:55.668 --> 01:06:56.934
Chandler, I just need to know
if there was...

01:06:56.936 --> 01:06:58.302
I need to know
where the ride-along is.

01:06:58.304 --> 01:06:59.739
What... no, what...
what took you so long?

01:07:00.206 --> 01:07:01.838
We... we can only get
to this active shooter

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.342
- as quick as possible...
- No, you were an hour late,

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:05.943
- and we were outgunned.
- Chandler...

01:07:05.945 --> 01:07:09.282
And my... and my son is dead!

01:07:09.815 --> 01:07:11.217
He's dead!

01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:14.588
He has a child on the way!

01:07:15.288 --> 01:07:16.690
What took you so long?

01:07:21.427 --> 01:07:23.860
Chandler, you gotta de-escalate.

01:07:23.862 --> 01:07:26.296
You gotta let me put together
my SWAT team here,

01:07:26.298 --> 01:07:27.731
let me get an entry plan
in place,

01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:28.865
so we can get into this building

01:07:28.867 --> 01:07:30.467
and get this structure cleared.

01:07:30.469 --> 01:07:32.305
I need you to bring it
down for me, okay?

01:07:38.612 --> 01:07:41.282
- Who the hell are you?
- Rossi, Interpol.

01:07:41.614 --> 01:07:42.847
Okay and?

01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:44.617
She gave us the lead
on the warehouse.

01:07:44.884 --> 01:07:45.816
And?

01:07:45.818 --> 01:07:47.719
And she confirmed
who we're dealing with.

01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:49.454
Okay, I'm well aware
of who we're dealing with.

01:07:49.456 --> 01:07:51.192
I'm very familiar
with these assholes.

01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:54.358
Well, that's very American
of you to say.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.994
Okay, listen, listen, listen.
I got the Mayor...

01:07:55.996 --> 01:07:58.329
excuse me... I got the Mayor
crawling up my ass, okay?

01:07:58.331 --> 01:07:59.731
I got the Governor talking
about flying out here

01:07:59.733 --> 01:08:00.932
to coordinate this thing.
Right now,

01:08:00.934 --> 01:08:01.999
I don't have time for this.

01:08:02.001 --> 01:08:03.635
I either need these guys
in cuffs,

01:08:03.637 --> 01:08:05.206
or I need these guys in a slab.

01:08:05.472 --> 01:08:06.938
And Agent,
whatever your name is,

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.773
if you've got useful intel
that I can use

01:08:08.775 --> 01:08:11.476
for my entry team, then go ahead
and coordinate it, okay?

01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:12.278
I'm done.

01:08:12.646 --> 01:08:14.878
Your Lieutenant
is an imbecile.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.481
Hey, you know what,
I'm pretty sure

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:18.484
Mike Chandler would agree
with you on that one.

01:08:18.917 --> 01:08:20.817
Officer Chandler learned
what those men

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.555
in the bank are capable of.

01:08:23.657 --> 01:08:25.626
Thank you,
we already have a plan.

01:08:26.826 --> 01:08:29.395
These men don't go
by the book, Captain.

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:31.497
They're waiting for you
to attack.

01:08:32.532 --> 01:08:33.567
Have you read Moltke?

01:08:35.902 --> 01:08:39.303
"No plan of operations
extends with any certainty."

01:08:39.305 --> 01:08:42.375
"Beyond the first contact
with the main hostile force."

01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:43.978
Is that the best you can do?

01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:47.648
These men are experts
at the point of first contact.

01:08:47.912 --> 01:08:49.849
They turn plans
against the planner.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:52.252
An escape route becomes a trap.

01:08:52.786 --> 01:08:54.988
Tell me, what do I do?
Do I let them go?

01:08:55.654 --> 01:08:58.259
- Wait it out? Hmm?
- I just...

01:08:58.658 --> 01:09:00.090
No, wait, te... tell me,
what the hell

01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:02.528
do I do when they start
shooting hostages in there?

01:09:03.328 --> 01:09:04.663
- I just...
- Just what?

01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:11.005
I want you to understand.

01:09:11.805 --> 01:09:15.274
They will use your assault
to leverage their escape.

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:17.810
Everyone on that street
will be in danger.

01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:38.962
This reminds me of that
extraction we did in Kabul.

01:09:38.965 --> 01:09:40.734
- Remember that shit?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:47.608
- How many killings did you get?
- Thirty-two.

01:09:48.573 --> 01:09:50.310
That's right. The legend.

01:09:56.716 --> 01:09:58.715
We made it out of there,
we can make it out of here.

01:09:58.717 --> 01:10:00.320
Not much longer now.

01:10:00.886 --> 01:10:02.989
We're gonna walk outta here
with over a mill.

01:10:03.722 --> 01:10:05.022
Well, that's a lot more
than we ever made

01:10:05.024 --> 01:10:06.660
from the military, isn't it?

01:10:07.527 --> 01:10:08.729
We're not home yet.

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:12.333
We can expect SWAT very soon.

01:10:12.498 --> 01:10:13.733
Let's do what we do.

01:10:14.868 --> 01:10:16.737
I'm gonna go check up
on the hostages.

01:10:16.935 --> 01:10:18.404
Right.

01:10:32.752 --> 01:10:35.756
- Everybody good to go?
- 10-4.

01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:49.470
No, no. No, man!

01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:51.436
I wasn't...
I wasn't doing anything!

01:10:51.438 --> 01:10:52.571
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

01:10:52.573 --> 01:10:54.575
- I wasn't doing nothing, man.
- You leave him alone!

01:10:56.042 --> 01:10:57.644
You're not a hero.

01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:02.082
You're gonna shoot me? Come on,
just go ahead and do it.

01:11:02.782 --> 01:11:05.386
Shoot me right here now.
Yes, yes, yes.

01:11:22.836 --> 01:11:24.438
Eat something.

01:11:31.543 --> 01:11:32.712
Any intel?

01:11:32.945 --> 01:11:34.611
We were able to access
the bank's interior

01:11:34.613 --> 01:11:35.612
surveillance cameras.

01:11:35.614 --> 01:11:38.952
We have hostages.
My best count makes it 13.

01:11:41.087 --> 01:11:42.954
Red team,
we can make our approach

01:11:42.956 --> 01:11:45.726
from the east corner here,
slow and deliberate.

01:11:45.958 --> 01:11:47.825
Blue team, opposite side.

01:11:47.827 --> 01:11:49.861
Force entry here, right through
the main entrance.

01:11:49.863 --> 01:11:52.633
Now, from the video, it looks
like we have four suspects.

01:11:52.832 --> 01:11:54.034
We'll assume there's more.

01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:56.170
- Any questions?
- Negative.

01:11:57.103 --> 01:11:59.472
I can get five guns in there
in three seconds.

01:12:00.773 --> 01:12:02.643
- Set it up.
- You got it.

01:12:03.576 --> 01:12:04.578
All right, gentlemen,

01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:06.145
let's keep the casualties down
to a minimum, okay?

01:12:06.813 --> 01:12:08.579
Roger that.

01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:09.716
Sir.

01:12:10.649 --> 01:12:11.915
Chandler, what's up?

01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:13.050
Sir, what about the kid?

01:12:13.052 --> 01:12:15.221
He's gotta be out there
in that parking lot somewhere.

01:12:15.854 --> 01:12:18.591
We got this. Just let us
do our job, okay?

01:12:18.858 --> 01:12:21.128
Sir, he's my responsibility.

01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:22.762
Not anymore.

01:12:25.631 --> 01:12:28.167
We'll get the ride-along.
Let's move out!

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:18.585
Here they come.

01:13:20.587 --> 01:13:21.822
I'll go get Tre.

01:13:44.077 --> 01:13:45.244
Go.

01:13:51.384 --> 01:13:54.253
Nice having y'all.
Just line it up here.

01:13:54.686 --> 01:13:56.086
It's the beginning
of the end right now.

01:13:56.088 --> 01:13:58.824
Come on, move it in.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:13:58.992 --> 01:14:00.761
- Come on.
- Get the fuck out.

01:14:02.228 --> 01:14:03.564
Moving.

01:14:12.704 --> 01:14:14.307
Be advised SWAT's moving in.

01:14:23.382 --> 01:14:26.150
Now come on, move it in!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:14:26.152 --> 01:14:28.385
Go! Faster, faster!
Don't fuck up.

01:14:28.387 --> 01:14:29.989
One, two. One, two.

01:14:30.789 --> 01:14:31.858
Right.

01:14:32.725 --> 01:14:34.728
Single line. Single line.

01:14:37.063 --> 01:14:39.932
It's him.
He's in that Chevy Blazer.

01:14:40.265 --> 01:14:41.768
I'm going for him.

01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:43.937
SWAT's about to make entry.

01:14:44.203 --> 01:14:46.173
I don't care. I can't leave him.

01:14:46.405 --> 01:14:49.141
If you wanna go get the kid,
I'm with you. Okay?

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:53.614
- Let's go get the kid.
- This is my deal. I can't ask.

01:14:54.012 --> 01:14:55.148
Look, you didn't ask.

01:14:55.814 --> 01:14:57.149
And we're brothers.

01:14:57.783 --> 01:15:00.286
Yeah, we are.
Let's go get him.

01:15:00.886 --> 01:15:02.322
All right,
let's do this.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.369
Stop him!

01:15:23.842 --> 01:15:26.179
Listen to me. Listen!
You're almost there.

01:15:26.445 --> 01:15:28.379
When I say go, get them
through the door

01:15:28.381 --> 01:15:31.251
and into the parking lot.
Okay? Okay?

01:15:32.385 --> 01:15:34.721
Rob, Luke! Let's set up!

01:15:52.404 --> 01:15:54.006
We're gonna have
to make a run for it.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.110
- Okay. Follow me.
- I'll cover you.

01:15:57.877 --> 01:15:59.079
All right, I'm moving.

01:16:04.216 --> 01:16:05.818
- Kenny!
- Chandler!

01:16:08.988 --> 01:16:10.955
Come on. SWAT's gonna breach
the building.

01:16:10.957 --> 01:16:12.292
Gotta get to safe distance.

01:16:20.533 --> 01:16:23.270
Nice and easy, boys.
Nice and easy.

01:16:36.015 --> 01:16:38.051
Okay, guys, 10 seconds.

01:16:40.386 --> 01:16:42.255
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.395
Move, move, move!

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:54.134
- Move! Move!
- He put something in my pocket!

01:16:54.533 --> 01:16:56.135
- Where?
- Here!

01:17:02.007 --> 01:17:04.344
Shit! Move!

01:17:05.043 --> 01:17:06.313
Shit!

01:17:13.886 --> 01:17:15.789
Go, go, go!

01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.760
Grenades!

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.377
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Goddammit! Fuck!

01:17:39.478 --> 01:17:41.512
Get them the fuck
out of there now!

01:17:41.514 --> 01:17:44.083
All of them,
I want them out! Now!

01:17:59.599 --> 01:18:01.802
Let's take these assholes out!

01:18:20.619 --> 01:18:22.154
Point right!

01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:50.984
Push him back!

01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:59.426
Hanson, keep firing!

01:19:08.434 --> 01:19:10.203
Ah, fuck!

01:19:33.725 --> 01:19:35.161
You all right?

01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:13.666
Kenny? Kenny!

01:20:18.237 --> 01:20:20.640
Oh! Are you all right?

01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:22.642
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.944
One hundred percent.

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:32.519
You did good today.

01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:34.487
Thank you.

01:20:36.087 --> 01:20:37.623
Sorry it turned out like this.

01:21:00.813 --> 01:21:02.248
Dad!

01:21:10.288 --> 01:21:13.726
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you, too, dad.

01:21:50.429 --> 01:21:52.095
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

01:21:52.097 --> 01:21:53.496
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, old man!

01:21:53.498 --> 01:21:54.598
What are you guys doing here?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.036
- Come here! Come here!
- Happy birthday!

01:21:56.301 --> 01:21:58.434
- Surprise!
- There's people in my house.

01:21:58.436 --> 01:22:00.838
Can't have that.
How'd you get in?

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.107
We got him good.

01:22:12.384 --> 01:22:14.087
Come kiss your granddaughter.

01:22:16.387 --> 01:22:17.720
Hey, Kenny, where's that phone

01:22:17.722 --> 01:22:19.458
you're always screwing
around with?

01:22:21.327 --> 01:22:23.063
I wanna take some new pics.

01:22:27.587 --> 01:22:32.587
