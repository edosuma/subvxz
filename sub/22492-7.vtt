00:18.878 --> 00:20.778
It's alive!

00:46.305 --> 00:47.533
In a world of
low expectations,

00:47.607 --> 00:50.098
Many people will stoop to please
the general public,

00:50.176 --> 00:52.667
but only 17 will put on
the fat suit!

00:52.745 --> 00:53.939
Damn!

00:54.013 --> 00:56.641
Now see the movie you've
already seen...

00:56.716 --> 00:57.842
I'm sliding!

00:57.917 --> 00:59.509
...100 times before!

00:59.585 --> 01:01.075
Giblet greens!

01:04.690 --> 01:06.817
Complete with dancing
scenes...

01:06.893 --> 01:09.862
Farting scenes...

01:09.929 --> 01:10.861
and, of course, sex scenes,

01:10.930 --> 01:12.192
yeah!

01:12.265 --> 01:14.324
Ain't you want your
girlfriend who's hot?

01:14.400 --> 01:15.731
That's me!

01:18.971 --> 01:21.701
It's the second best fat-suit
movie in at least four months.

01:22.175 --> 01:25.042
So, you see, sharing is
great!

01:25.111 --> 01:27.477
Ga! Ga! Ga! Ga! Ga! Ga! Ga!

01:27.547 --> 01:28.946
Aw, call 911.

01:29.015 --> 01:31.882
Victor's stroking out again.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.917
Hey, baby, buy you a drink?

01:34.987 --> 01:36.784
Sure.
What's your name?

01:36.856 --> 01:37.914
Big Jim.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.015
That's a really interesting
name.

01:40.092 --> 01:41.389
What do you do for a living?

01:41.460 --> 01:43.690
Well, little lady,
since you asked...

01:43.763 --> 01:45.230
# Big Jim! #

01:45.298 --> 01:48.358
# Victory man to man with
the big-ass action battle plan #

01:48.434 --> 01:49.958
# Big Jim! #

01:50.036 --> 01:53.665
# Kicking ass without a hitch
and beating Zorak like a bitch #

01:53.739 --> 01:56.902
# Winning every action match,
Zorak might just have a flash #

01:56.976 --> 01:58.409
# Zorak, what a mega wuss #

01:58.477 --> 02:00.502
# Big Jim,
you're a ninja puss #

02:00.580 --> 02:01.672
# Big Jim! #

02:01.747 --> 02:04.307
You're ugly!

02:06.319 --> 02:07.980
Booya!

02:08.054 --> 02:09.782
Yeah!
# Big Jim! #

02:09.854 --> 02:12.187
Wow, you wanna go back to my
place?

02:12.258 --> 02:13.247
Yeah, sure, baby.

02:13.326 --> 02:14.725
Just let me drain
the lizard first,

02:14.794 --> 02:17.228
the trouser trout,
the legless iguana...

02:17.296 --> 02:18.957
I'm talking about going to the
bathroom

02:19.031 --> 02:21.226
real quick before we
get out of here.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.631
Hello, pretty lady.

02:22.702 --> 02:23.896
Oh, hello.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.768
Do you want to know why they
call him "Big Jim"?

02:32.211 --> 02:34.702
It's a very ironic nickname.

02:36.182 --> 02:39.379
How about you, me,
your bed...

02:41.587 --> 02:45.455
Loud screams, god being called,
everyone smiles?

02:47.193 --> 02:51.960
# Foiled by his greatest foe,
Zorak is a cock block pro #

02:52.031 --> 02:56.127
# Big Jim! #

02:56.936 --> 03:00.497
All: If you don't buy us, we get killed!

03:00.573 --> 03:01.699
Check it out!

03:01.774 --> 03:02.832
I'm a mom!

03:02.908 --> 03:05.638
Look at my pretty jacket because
I'm a lady!

03:05.711 --> 03:06.735
I've got boobs!

03:07.747 --> 03:09.112
Oh, my!

03:09.181 --> 03:10.170
What the...

03:13.085 --> 03:14.017
Is this your mom?

03:14.086 --> 03:14.916
Ow! Ow!

03:14.987 --> 03:16.648
Is this your mom?!

03:16.722 --> 03:17.950
Yes! Yes!

03:18.024 --> 03:19.548
I want my mommy!

03:19.625 --> 03:20.853
Why?!

03:22.495 --> 03:24.656
Bring in the horses!

03:24.730 --> 03:26.561
Oh, no, no, no, no!

03:26.632 --> 03:27.656
Aah!

03:28.601 --> 03:29.499
Ha!

03:29.568 --> 03:32.298
That'll show you for making fun
of my backpack...

03:32.371 --> 03:34.134
Oh, wait a minute.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.141
This isn't Billy's place!

03:37.209 --> 03:39.734
Are your hired mercenaries
not as good as advertised?

03:39.812 --> 03:42.042
Well, come on down to
Dave's Mercenary Warehouse.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.604
We kill the right guy or your
money back.

03:45.451 --> 03:47.419
What I want is
the color of snow

03:47.486 --> 03:49.716
and make snails understand
death!

03:49.789 --> 03:50.813
Aah!

03:50.890 --> 03:52.858
For crying out loud,
here is the salt!

03:52.925 --> 03:54.859
Just ask for the salt!

03:54.927 --> 03:55.859
What a great double date!

03:55.928 --> 03:57.054
Yeah!

03:57.129 --> 03:58.892
And, oh, my god,
"Ghost Rider" was excellent!

03:58.964 --> 04:00.397
I really should get you home.

04:00.466 --> 04:02.525
There's supposed to be a full
moon tonight.

04:02.601 --> 04:03.829
Oh, Dan, what,

04:03.903 --> 04:06.098
are you gonna turn into a
werewolf or something?

04:06.172 --> 04:09.266
Yeah, the werewolf who bit me
was pretty clear about that.

04:09.342 --> 04:10.309
Damn it, Dan!

04:10.376 --> 04:11.638
If you knew there was
a full moon,

04:11.711 --> 04:13.076
why'd you even come out
tonight?

04:13.145 --> 04:14.976
Well, my roommate brought
home a gutter skank,

04:15.047 --> 04:17.447
and I figured we'd walk out of
"Ghost Rider" anyway...

04:17.516 --> 04:18.346
Man!

04:21.721 --> 04:23.279
Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:23.356 --> 04:26.325
Ramona, he wasn't really a
werewolf!

04:26.392 --> 04:29.122
That Dan is always making up
stories.

04:29.195 --> 04:31.527
Wow, he was really
convincing!

04:31.597 --> 04:33.224
Ha, he really got you!

04:34.266 --> 04:35.961
Best gag ever!

04:36.035 --> 04:37.127
That was so funny.

04:37.203 --> 04:40.570
I mean, I really thought he was
a werewolf.

04:40.639 --> 04:43.904
Hey, aren't you Doug Funnie
from that show "Doug"?

04:43.976 --> 04:44.806
Yeah.

04:44.877 --> 04:45.844
Oh, that's awesome.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.037
What have you been up to?

04:47.113 --> 04:48.478
Nothin'.

04:55.988 --> 04:58.252
It started to rain at a
quarter to 2:00

04:58.324 --> 04:59.416
when the children both cried...

04:59.492 --> 05:01.357
Both:
We've got nothing to do!

05:01.427 --> 05:04.624
They played their kerplunkas
and spun their spindaddies.

05:04.697 --> 05:07.257
Why, they even found mother's
vibratoraties.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.063
When suddenly there came a knock
at the door.

05:10.136 --> 05:11.694
The boy nudged his sister.

05:11.771 --> 05:13.033
Go get it, you whore!

05:13.105 --> 05:15.630
She rose from her seat and
walked towards the noise.

05:15.708 --> 05:16.675
Who could it be?

05:16.742 --> 05:18.141
She hoped it was boys.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.610
But what entered the house through
the fog oh-so thick

05:20.679 --> 05:23.512
was a cat in a hat with an
enormous dick.

05:23.582 --> 05:26.608
He sang a short song and played
a few toots...

05:26.685 --> 05:28.915
when all of a sudden, he noticed
poor boots.

05:28.988 --> 05:31.218
The boy searched around for a
pen and a pad.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.815
This guy's a pro, much better
than dad.

05:33.893 --> 05:36.327
But before the two children
could learn a new trade,

05:36.395 --> 05:37.885
the cat pushed them outside.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.158
I'm trying to get laid!

05:40.232 --> 05:42.632
So with nowhere to go but
over the hill,

05:42.701 --> 05:45.067
the children set off for the
town of Whoreville.

05:45.137 --> 05:48.072
They passed a few vagrants,
a hooker, a corpse,

05:48.140 --> 05:50.734
trying their best not to vomit,
of course.

05:50.810 --> 05:53.005
Though it got pretty hard as
they passed by a can

05:53.078 --> 05:56.878
where a man tried to shit out
some blue eggs and spam.

05:56.949 --> 05:59.315
Finally they arrived at their
mom's place of work

05:59.385 --> 06:02.149
as a jolly old man walked out
with a smirk.

06:02.221 --> 06:04.712
It was Itchy McGray who was
there every day.

06:04.790 --> 06:08.021
And though his doctor sure
pleaded, he could not stay away.

06:08.093 --> 06:09.560
He had caught whore diseases.

06:09.628 --> 06:11.095
He had picked at whore scabs.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.393
Why he even picked up a case of
whore crabs.

06:13.466 --> 06:15.491
But all of a sudden,
he started to run

06:15.568 --> 06:18.366
'cause the children's drunk
father showed up with a gun.

06:18.437 --> 06:19.904
He was mean. He was mad.

06:19.972 --> 06:21.405
He was seven feet tall.

06:21.474 --> 06:26.343
But the bulge in his pants was
two sizes too small...

06:26.412 --> 06:28.846
which may have explained why he
went on a spree

06:28.914 --> 06:31.246
of shooting the whores as they
started to flee.

06:31.317 --> 06:32.614
One bitch!
Two bitch!

06:32.685 --> 06:34.312
Old bitch!
New bitch!

06:34.386 --> 06:36.980
...he said with a laugh as their
bodies did twitch.

06:37.056 --> 06:40.025
He stared at his wife as he
squeezed on his glock.

06:40.092 --> 06:43.357
I know it's your job, but
why'd you hop on my pop?!

06:43.429 --> 06:44.691
We needed the cash!

06:44.763 --> 06:46.754
...She said through her
tears.

06:46.832 --> 06:49.494
And besides, you haven't
touched me in years.

06:49.568 --> 06:51.035
But I've got just the thing.

06:51.103 --> 06:52.593
She knew just what to do.

06:52.671 --> 06:56.437
Let's go home right now and
make three kids, not two.

06:56.509 --> 06:59.273
And so the kids' father got
his own way.

06:59.345 --> 07:02.803
And the bulge in his pants grew
three sizes that day.

07:02.882 --> 07:05.942
And the low-income family began
life anew,

07:06.018 --> 07:09.954
at least till next month when
the rent would come due.

07:10.022 --> 07:11.046
Lion-o!

07:11.123 --> 07:13.921
The evil mutants are coming!

07:13.993 --> 07:15.824
Thunder!
Thunder!

07:15.895 --> 07:16.725
Thund...

07:16.795 --> 07:17.887
Ow!

07:17.963 --> 07:19.021
Snarf!

07:19.098 --> 07:21.464
Oh, Snarf, what have I done?!

07:21.534 --> 07:26.699
Lion-o, listen closely, for
these are my dying words.

07:26.772 --> 07:29.605
Yes? Yes?

07:29.675 --> 07:40.711
Sna-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-rf!

07:40.786 --> 07:42.344
No, no time to grieve.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.685
Those evil mutants
are on the way!

07:44.757 --> 07:46.247
Uh, we made that up.

07:46.325 --> 07:49.089
Yeah, we were kinda just
f'ing with ya.

07:49.161 --> 07:52.597
Oh, Snarf, your final resting
place will be on our mantel

07:52.665 --> 07:54.633
where we can remember you
always.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.531
Where should we put
this vase now?

07:56.602 --> 07:57.796
Oh, anywhere.

07:57.870 --> 08:00.236
You did a really good job
stuffing him, Lion-o.

08:00.306 --> 08:01.204
Jaga!

08:01.273 --> 08:02.763
Snarf is in a better
place now.

08:02.841 --> 08:05.309
But young Lion-o still needs a
nagging nursemaid.

08:05.377 --> 08:06.674
At last!

08:06.745 --> 08:11.682
My chance to destroy that
accursed Lion-o has arrived!

08:11.750 --> 08:12.614
Idiot!

08:12.685 --> 08:15.176
<i>This is the magic cauldron!</i>

08:15.254 --> 08:17.722
<i>That's the laundry cauldron!</i>

08:18.958 --> 08:21.521
Get out of my way!

08:21.594 --> 08:23.619
I'm gonna get it,
you dumb bitch!

08:23.696 --> 08:24.663
Stupid head!

08:24.730 --> 08:25.662
Stupid girl!

08:25.731 --> 08:29.223
Hello.
I'm Mrs. Mumblety-peg.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.030
The catsitting service sent me.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.229
You're old.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.328
You smell like buttholes
stuffed with wet dog.

08:34.405 --> 08:36.101
Children!

08:36.174 --> 08:38.166
Respect your elders.

08:40.412 --> 08:42.243
Washy! Washy!

08:45.484 --> 08:49.887
Lion-o, eat your veggies!

08:49.955 --> 08:52.947
Mmm.

08:56.629 --> 08:57.789
Doh!

08:57.863 --> 08:59.228
Shit!

09:06.972 --> 09:08.439
It's Mrs. Mumblety-peg!

09:08.507 --> 09:09.997
Oh, come in.

09:10.075 --> 09:12.100
I'm just taking a bath.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.166
Oh!

09:13.245 --> 09:15.440
I thought you were bathing,
dear.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.845
I am.

09:16.915 --> 09:20.180
Gee, for a catsitter, you don't
know a lot about cats.

09:20.252 --> 09:22.720
Oh, wow!

09:22.788 --> 09:27.725
Um... Mrs. Mumblety-peg needs to
go masturbate... I mean,

09:27.793 --> 09:30.785
um, uh, see, Mrs.... What I
meant was,

09:30.863 --> 09:33.195
Mrs. Mumblety-peg...

09:33.265 --> 09:35.130
Fuck it,
I'm gonna go masturbate.

09:41.807 --> 09:43.570
That's Mumm-ra!

09:43.642 --> 09:45.200
Stop right there, Mumm-ra!

09:45.277 --> 09:46.141
Oh, my god!

09:46.211 --> 09:48.304
I'm having a private moment!

09:48.380 --> 09:50.007
He's getting away!

09:50.082 --> 09:52.175
You stupid Thundercats!

09:53.686 --> 09:55.813
I'll be back!

09:55.888 --> 09:57.082
Ow, god damn it!

09:57.156 --> 09:58.521
Not this shit again fuck,

09:58.590 --> 10:01.684
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

10:01.760 --> 10:04.854
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Oh, fuck!

10:04.930 --> 10:08.593
Oh, Snarf, even in death,
you've saved the Thundercats.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.134
We'll never forget you.

10:10.202 --> 10:13.262
On the other hand, that thing
is really ugly.

10:13.338 --> 10:14.930
Ugh.

10:15.774 --> 10:18.299
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

10:18.377 --> 10:20.436
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk
bawk bawk #

10:20.512 --> 10:22.571
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

10:22.648 --> 10:24.741
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk

10:24.817 --> 10:26.876
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
