WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:02.168
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.252 --> 00:04.129
-Mind if I join you?
-Mind if you don't.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.424
-Rosie, this is--
-Dr. Adrian Webb. The new ME.

00:07.507 --> 00:10.635
After you solve this thing,
you can make it up to me.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.303
Oh, I plan to.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.974
Ever since you two started playing
this reckless breakfast thing...

00:16.057 --> 00:17.267
Yes!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.144
...I've seen a spark in Kayla.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.812
So now that I've shared
all my red flags...

00:20.895 --> 00:22.230
I know I owe you a real date.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.482
You do and I was thinking...

00:24.566 --> 00:26.735
-Club One.
-You want to go to the opera with me?

00:26.818 --> 00:29.237
I will be there Saturday, 7:30 sharp.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.877
Sometimes a morning
starts like any other.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.020
Some people
have a photographic memory.

01:02.479 --> 01:06.524
And remember every moment,
every detail of their lives.

01:17.452 --> 01:21.206
Sometimes there are moments
that are so perfect,

01:22.582 --> 01:25.085
you know they'll be embedded forever.

01:35.678 --> 01:39.933
For others, life is a constant
assault & battery.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.739
Wherever you look in Miami,
everyone is the same.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.992
Nobody knows
exactly what lies ahead of them.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.452
Or what the day may bring.

02:04.916 --> 02:09.712
There was no question
that today something was in the air.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.892
Whoa, whoa, guys! Look at this.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.979
Look at this. Do you guys know
what you're looking at right here?

02:26.062 --> 02:28.857
- What?
- This right here is a sign.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.276
This is a sign that I am whole.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.154
It's gonna be a good day, people.
It's gonna be a good day.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.490
Hey, you.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.033
Remember me?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.452
What's up?

02:41.911 --> 02:46.332
Just the hands in the gastrointestinal
tract thing, you know.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.792
That's what I'm looking at?

02:48.751 --> 02:50.795
I know
I didn't show up to the theater.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.755
Hey, you know what though?
Don't do that.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.216
I heard you loud and clear.
It's okay. You're off the hook.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.801
But maybe I don't wanna be.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.306
So you know what you don't want.
Do you know what you do want?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.976
See, not a trick question.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.315
Hey, Villa, Villa. Villa, Villa.

03:10.773 --> 03:14.152
Either you're wearing too much cocoa
butter or you were just at the beach.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.987
No, I'd say the perfect amount.

03:16.112 --> 03:20.533
And, yes, I was experiencing what
some would call the perfect moment.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.784
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.703
A crystal clear sign that I need to

03:23.786 --> 03:25.496
take the her and me thing
to the next level.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.332
Do I wanna know
what you think that is?

03:27.665 --> 03:29.918
Well, tonight it means
take-out from Phu Tang's.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.670
Yeah, a little bit of garlic shrimp
out on the deck under the stars

03:33.671 --> 03:36.132
and the three of us as a family.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.511
Hey, speaking of relationships,
have you and Adrian DTRd yet?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.305
Excuse me?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.849
DTR. I guess you don't like that.
"Excuse me?"

03:44.933 --> 03:46.726
I'm talking about
defining the relationship, Villa.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.687
Who talks like that
and no, it's complicated, okay.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.858
See the best way to uncomplicate
a situation is to, say it with me,

03:53.942 --> 03:55.860
-"Define a situation."
-Define.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.239
Oh, Rosie, missed you earlier.
It happened, man.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.698
-What's that?
-I had a moment.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.367
What? I had a moment too.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.035
-See, something's in the air.
-It's in the air.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.454
Should I leave so you guys
can hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"?

04:06.788 --> 04:09.082
Poor Villa. She's a little mad
right now 'cause she's momentless.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.502
Well, you know what? Don't hate Villa,
okay, 'cause your moment's gonna come.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.461
It's gonna come.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.338
Right now, I gotta go in there
and talk to those students.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.673
Inspiring young minds feels like

04:16.756 --> 04:18.758
the perfect next step
to this glorious day.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.051
They are our future, you know.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.011
Well, what's up, kids?

04:22.470 --> 04:23.554
How are you guys doing?

04:24.347 --> 04:28.309
Yeah? My name is Ryan Slade,
I am the Captain of the EMPD.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.103
Thank you guys
for coming in for the tour.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.814
Oh, come on. Can I get
some more smiles here?

04:32.897 --> 04:35.316
There we go. All right.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.486
I'm gonna make this day very memorable
for you guys, all right?

04:38.569 --> 04:40.488
We're gonna have some fun.
You, what's your name?

04:40.822 --> 04:43.032
No, no, come on, we're not
about name tags here. All right?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.368
Just step forward with confidence
and say your name.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.452
It's Axton.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.454
Really?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.748
Damn, that's a cool name.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.835
Axton. I like it.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.088
All right. Well, let me introduce you
and your classmates here

04:57.171 --> 04:59.882
to some of the fine young men
and women who serve alongside me.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.760
Well, he's not very young
but he's got a cool name.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.015
Hi, I'm Officer Brodhead,
I work in the Evidence Room.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.895
How about you?
What division are you in?

05:14.188 --> 05:16.649
I am, uh, Officer McKinney.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.029
Everyone put your weapons down.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.948
Go.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.784
I said, put your weapons down.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.411
You heard him! You heard him!

05:29.245 --> 05:30.246
Drop it.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.542
Being a cowboy is gonna get
a lot of people hurt,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.753
especially your salt and pepper
captain here.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.464
-Put your gun down.
-Villa, you might wanna listen to him.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.925
I said, drop your weapon.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.595
All right, cowgirl here
doesn't want to listen.

05:54.103 --> 05:54.979
Okay.

05:56.481 --> 06:00.234
Everyone, here's a little preview
of what's gonna happen,

06:01.444 --> 06:03.905
if you don't listen to what I say
when I say it.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.140
Do I have your attention now?

06:33.768 --> 06:34.894
Good.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.714
You all go right ahead.
It's my unit.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.392
I know, I know.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.606
Barbara Dicasoli here looking at what
appears to be a hostage situation...

07:20.690 --> 07:23.109
...unfolding at East Miami
Police Department.

07:23.484 --> 07:27.613
I am told there are children on
a field trip from High School inside.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.992
And there's no information about
what is being requested,

07:31.075 --> 07:32.869
or the purpose of the takeover.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.663
All we know is that this
is a very grave situation

07:35.746 --> 07:37.165
and that all streets in the vicinity

07:37.248 --> 07:39.709
have been closed
for suspected bomb threats.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.046
Reporting live from the East Miami PD,
I'm Barbara Dicasoli for News 5.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.216
Focus. We have people
on the inside right now

07:47.300 --> 07:48.759
counting on us to get them out.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.304
If you are not up for this task, you
can go home and play with yourself.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.723
-What's going on in there?
-Stay back, sir.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.893
-Hey, lady, I asked you a question.
-Yeah, I heard the question.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.688
The thing is I don't ever, ever,
respond to anybody that calls me lady.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.565
I'm FBI Special Agent Harrows
and if you don't mind--

08:02.648 --> 08:05.234
Oh, you're the negotiator.
Well, I'm not leaving.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.489
Agents Harrows, we have an ID
on our captor. Owen Panitch, age 38.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.700
Okay, 38, divorced,
computer analyst at MIT,

08:12.783 --> 08:14.577
works at Artech, this is all we have?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.455
He's not in our computer at all,
not even a parking ticket.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.915
Who doesn't have a parking ticket?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.250
I just don't believe some nice guy
wakes up one day,

08:21.334 --> 08:22.835
and decides to play a Bond villain.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.545
This guy's gonna put us on a clock.

08:24.629 --> 08:28.216
I've got my own clock ticking
so if you don't mind, Ira Hornstock.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.843
Doesn't quite roll off
the tongue, does it?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.476
I mean, how many days you get to come
to work and take your shoes off?

08:38.726 --> 08:41.771
You can't possibly be wearing
your Rosie colored glasses right now.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.940
Villa, you don't have the glasses, okay.
I got all types.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.025
Yes, I know, how you like to
look at the world

08:46.108 --> 08:48.361
-but right now...
-Can you see this?

08:49.153 --> 08:50.404
Hmm? You see this?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.365
It's not about the glasses.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.618
It's about me staying focused
whenever you're ready to do our thing.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.744
I am right there with you.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.955
All right, campers, listen up.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.832
You know my associate,
but you haven't met him formally.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.960
Duke.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.549
You're all gonna wear one of these.
You are all numbers now.

09:09.632 --> 09:13.094
Here, take one. Pass it down.
Take one, pass it down.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.595
But not you, no.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.724
No, you're special and you get
my favorite number.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.311
You don't have to take off your shoes.
You're kind of my star hostage.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.523
What're you talking about?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.191
Oh, what you don't remember me?

09:27.775 --> 09:28.776
Come on.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.863
The 12th precinct, your old home.
It's only been two months.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.450
Yeah, well, you've changed too.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.245
Got a little extra jazz
on the jowl line.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.288
Excuse me, sir.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.290
May I have a snack, something to eat?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.167
Oh, you want a snack?
Let me think, no.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.502
Why don't you check the floor?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.629
Maybe you can find some candy
in the debris.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.714
Don't do that either.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.258
He's dehumanizing us.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.760
Yeah, it's easier for him to kill us
if he has to.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.013
Panitch's girlfriend.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.473
Dispatched a black and white
to her residence but no answer.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.934
Get on it. I might need her down here
to pull on his heart strings.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.811
Agent Harrows,
Tactical just found this

10:03.894 --> 10:05.354
at the southeast entrance
to the loading dock.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.607
-Do you want me to ask you what it is?
-We have a line.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.111
Hey, that's a putty, used as
an adhesive agent in explosives.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.654
That guy is for real.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.947
Please, thank you.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.115
Showtime.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.205
Hello, Owen.
This is FBI Agent Harrows.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.000
First of all, are you okay?
Is everybody okay in there?

10:26.083 --> 10:27.209
Right now they are.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.837
All right, that's a good thing.
That's what we want to hear.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.089
-I was hoping that we could maybe--
-Talk for a minute?

10:32.506 --> 10:33.924
Maybe find some common ground.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.926
Wait, let me guess,
you wanna be my friend?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.346
You think I don't know
the steps to this dance?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.431
Hey, hey, just hear me out.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.558
I just wanna know what it is you want.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.186
That's my job, I'm a go getter.
You ask me for something and I--

10:45.269 --> 10:48.564
Deliver Walter Panitch
to where you're standing.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.649
That's step one.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.401
You have exactly 60 minutes
from right now.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.449
No!

10:58.532 --> 11:00.493
Unless you think
this is an idle threat,

11:00.576 --> 11:02.912
I've every inch of this place
rigged to blow.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.955
So do not test me!

11:05.998 --> 11:08.959
Okay, gentlemen, you heard him.
Let's find out who Walter Panitch is.

11:09.043 --> 11:12.046
A father, dead relative,
imaginary childhood friend.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.632
Then see what his relationship
is with explosives.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.717
Is it a love affair, is he pining?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.469
You got a death wish, kid?

11:19.136 --> 11:23.808
These bombs are set to go off every 12
minutes unless I input the code.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.726
And only I know what that is.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.270
My high school locker number
plus my birthday.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.065
Just kidding.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.775
Whoo, whoo.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.820
Loosen up, relax.
It's gonna be a long day.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.115
I think it's time to break up
these fast-forming cliques.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.159
Yeah, you two. I see you.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.995
All right, time to go.
Middle school dance style.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.665
Girls on one side,
sad boys on the other.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.208
These guys know
what I'm talking about.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.543
No one talks and no one moves.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.836
Duke, make it happen.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.004
You gotta go to the bathroom, hold it.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.965
I'm gonna go down
and search for stragglers.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.175
Anyone gets cute, shoot them.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.680
All right, ladies first. Let's go.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.099
This is a list of everyone who I know
is in that building.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.310
I know this is your purview
and whatnot. But from what I know,

12:08.394 --> 12:10.604
65% of hostage situations occur

12:10.688 --> 12:12.273
because they know someone
who's inside.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.692
So I'm thinking
our guy either has a beef

12:14.775 --> 12:16.402
or he's holding a grudge
of some sorts.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.486
65%, huh?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.239
So you must've be the person
running point on the Doylestown seven

12:20.322 --> 12:23.576
or you were in Pensacola
for the Allied Savings & Loan fiasco?

12:23.659 --> 12:25.911
Oh, no, that was me.
Thank you so much, Detective.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.246
This is gonna be a lot of help.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.373
-Moose, can we get the boys suited up?
-Yes, ma'am.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.624
You're kidding me.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.210
This guy has hit trigger
on a detonator.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.379
You're gonna lose people. My people.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.881
Hey, that's my family in there.

12:36.964 --> 12:40.801
You like stats? 100% of hostages end
up dead when emotions are involved.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.928
That is why I am on the phone.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.346
And no more touching.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.980
Duke, it looks like we're on the
back up generator down here.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.776
I'm not coming back up
till I check every inch of this place.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.830
It's a shame you blew up
that vending machine.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.249
It's the first time it's worked
for me in months.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.376
Used to have to shake
the hell out of it.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.045
So who is this Walter guy?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.631
I'm gonna tell you to shut up!

13:20.007 --> 13:22.009
Not a fan of compliments,
all right? I get it.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.094
Just trying to pass the time, man.
That's it.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.138
Are you okay?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.808
-Is there anything you need?
-I need my shoes.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.061
You really think a pair of Nikes
is gonna help me run out of here?

13:32.144 --> 13:34.230
Those commercials can be
pretty damn convincing.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.691
-I'm Annalise.
-Astrid.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.528
So you're one of the smart ones
in your class?

13:40.903 --> 13:41.904
You think I'm a student?

13:42.738 --> 13:43.948
I blame the chair.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.032
Then why are you here?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.744
I was gonna give a witness statement
to Officer McKinney.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.080
I thought I'd make it home in time
to see my soaps but--

13:51.163 --> 13:54.250
-Witness statement?
-Yeah, the Seneca Mall robbery.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.626
Of course.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.587
Destroyed the food court
on their way out.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.589
Yeah, and guess who was
on the handicapped ramp

14:00.673 --> 14:03.467
near the Poko's Pretzels to witness
those two scumbags run.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.264
Duke has a shotgun.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.559
That's two rounds at a time.
I can take him down.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.726
He seems pretty unhinged.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.520
I know what I'm doing,
I'm a detective.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.272
Yeah, but he's a psychopath.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.028
Is there a doctor in the house?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.905
Yeah, right here. Why?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.991
'Cause 51 just got shot.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.878
Sorry, you gotta leave this bullet in
your leg 'cause it's too dangerous--

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
It's too dangerous
to remove right now.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.088
Exactly.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.800
Keep the pressure on that,
give you a little bit of this.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.010
Clean that up.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.057
It turns out Walter Panitch
is Owen's brother.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.351
He's doing a five stretch
in East Miami Correctional.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.104
I know the warden. Let me reach out,
let me see what he can do.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.064
I like it, make the call.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.113
-You're a good doctor, 15.
-Yeah, thanks.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.285
I mean, 'cause
you haven't seen my billboards?

15:11.368 --> 15:13.120
I have billboards all over the city.
You haven't seen them?

15:13.203 --> 15:15.080
Look. How about this?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.543
Where do you think
you're going, honey?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.378
Looks like 22's got
ants in her pants.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.963
-I just wanted to see--
-Shut up!

15:24.006 --> 15:25.507
Hey, you don't wanna hurt her.
She can help us.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.384
Who, us?
We're an us now, that's swell.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.137
Why don't you tell me
what she's gonna do for us?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.931
I can get you what you need.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.515
Help get everyone out of here safely.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.060
Nobody needs you and I don't
want you here, you got it?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.814
What I need is for everyone to stay
where I tell them to.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.233
Hey, Wheels,
don't even think about it.

15:43.859 --> 15:47.905
Look, don't give up on her just yet.
She's worth it.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.742
I need to get downstairs,
get some more supplies.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.078
All right.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.872
I haven't been referred to as a number
since my old days as a running back.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.416
You planning on telling anyone
your agenda?

16:00.542 --> 16:02.252
You seem like the kind of guy
who has an end game.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.338
You have no idea
what kind of guy I am.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.631
-I'm just--
-Keep it moving.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.218
I may not know everything about you
but I do know you're not as bad

16:09.301 --> 16:10.636
of a guy as you want us to believe.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.096
Oh, yeah, how do you know that?

16:12.179 --> 16:13.681
'Cause a real criminal
lets a guy bleed out.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.183
He surprised me,
he came at me with a scalpel.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.602
Look, I'm here to save my brother.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.480
Yes, it's admirable, but where is he

16:21.563 --> 16:23.148
while you're doing
all this stuff for him?

16:23.232 --> 16:24.149
Prison.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.403
His lawyer convinced him
to take a plea bargain

16:27.486 --> 16:29.405
'cause we couldn't afford
any more legal bills.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.407
But that was only
the beginning of my problems.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.491
He's dying in there.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.326
He's dying?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.705
I'll talk to the captain.
We'll see what we can do to help you.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.789
Slade?

16:39.748 --> 16:42.209
He's the original captain on the case
back at his old precinct.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.460
Mishandled it?

16:43.877 --> 16:45.295
It's more personal than that.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.049
All right let's, get down to the bottom
of it. Let's go talk to Slade.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.261
Okay, doc, let's talk to Slade.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.395
Thing is when you're in the chair,
people tend to not look at you.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.313
Gives me more time to look at them.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.984
I notice more details. Sense stuff.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.405
I'm getting
one of those senses right now.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.201
This seating arrangement
helping to jog your memory?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.746
I'm not going to be interrogated
in my own precinct.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.832
Captain, we're all hostages here.
So...

17:22.666 --> 17:24.209
Then why don't you take the cuffs off?

17:24.418 --> 17:25.711
Oh, is that uncomfortable?

17:25.794 --> 17:28.714
Well, now you know how everyone else
feels when they sit in that chair.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.425
So that's what this is.
Some kind of experiment.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.968
Oh, you're not getting it.
He's not getting it.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.428
-Getting what?
-This is not gonna work.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.387
What's not gonna work?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.889
I'm just gonna tape his mouth shut.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.891
Listen, why don't you let me
talk to him alone?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.727
If you want some real answers,
let me get to the truth.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.024
You got a minute and a half.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.110
I'll be right behind that door.
Understood?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.070
Got it.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.200
Captain.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.203
I need you to try to remember
exactly what happened to his brother.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.205
I know exactly
what happened to his brother.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.123
He was picked up trying
to cash a fake lottery ticket.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.875
The guy was huge. Two unis show up,

18:04.958 --> 18:07.211
he resists arrest,
he injures one of the cops...

18:07.961 --> 18:10.130
I mean, the guy must've been
jacked up on something.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.298
We had him dead to rights.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.966
I don't think
that's why he's here.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.637
Walt was resisting
because he didn't know any better.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.930
He was set up.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.389
Well, then, what did I do?

18:20.349 --> 18:23.185
What was so bad that you're putting
all these innocent lives in danger?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.269
Tell me.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.731
You wanna talk? Let's talk, you and I.
We can talk. Just let everyone go.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.358
You let everyone go.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.786
My brother is sick.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.581
He resisted because he is sick.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.879
I spent two months
screaming from rooftops,

18:52.840 --> 18:56.009
desperately trying to get anyone
to pay attention to his illness.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.845
And when I came to see you,

19:00.556 --> 19:02.558
you barely looked up from your desk.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.397
'Cause people don't listen
to people like me.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.943
And people don't care
about people like him.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.280
And you aren't any different.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.038
So now everyone's gonna pay.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.128
Because of your mistake.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.465
What's going on back there?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.593
Hey!

19:39.136 --> 19:40.345
Answer me!

19:41.972 --> 19:44.016
What's going on back there?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.268
Hey!

19:49.688 --> 19:52.274
Hands up, Duke. Face the wall.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.109
You too. Walk it to the wall.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.027
Detective, I have no idea--

19:55.110 --> 19:56.987
My guess is your legs work just fine.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.489
So hop to. I said, get up!

20:02.367 --> 20:04.786
Hands up! Turn around.

20:06.121 --> 20:09.082
I'll take this, you won't be
needing your little lady gun anymore.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.043
Villa, come on,
this is not the answer.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.586
Baby, don't do anything crazy.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.213
Yeah, baby, shoot the bitch.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.882
Baby, you can try but my gun
is bigger than yours.

20:18.133 --> 20:22.429
If you haven't figured it out yet,
Astrid and Owen are undercover lovers.

20:22.512 --> 20:25.140
You see, Astrid here
rolled into this station this morning

20:25.224 --> 20:27.392
to give a statement
to Officer McKinney

20:27.476 --> 20:29.770
about a robbery near Poko's Pretzels.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.022
-Listen to the Spicy Nancy Drew.
-Shut up!

20:32.356 --> 20:35.025
You see, Seneca Mall
doesn't have a Poko's.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.402
I can tell you every place
in Miami that does.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.571
I basically have a pretzel fetish.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.574
My guess is Officer McKinney is dead.

20:42.866 --> 20:43.784
That's not true.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.286
Add that to a list of charges
that are stacking by the second.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.206
Villa, come on. Okay.
Just think about this, all right?

20:49.665 --> 20:50.832
Owen wants me.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.709
Just deal with me, okay, man.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.629
Villa, I believe Owen.
We can do this another way.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.422
He may believe you but I don't.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.508
You know who else doesn't?

21:00.092 --> 21:03.679
That FBI negotiator out there.
You think she's trying to help you?

21:04.680 --> 21:08.433
Right now she's figuring out
how she's going to kill you.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.409
The pretzel story was rich,
but so is this.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.121
I'm gonna answer that phone,
so if you wanna shoot me, go ahead.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.582
Okay, Owen.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.294
I did a little research on my own
because I care.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.213
And I have a sinking feeling
your brother did not get a fair trial.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.424
And that doesn't make any of us
look good, does it?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.759
Yeah, the DA Martin Colfact,
I call him Marty.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.428
Dropping names is bad form.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.346
Yeah, only if it's just ear candy.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.890
You know, rather than drag
your brother all the way down here,

21:48.974 --> 21:51.476
I thought, you know what? How about I
just bang out a call to Marty--

21:51.560 --> 21:53.353
You know the second part
of our little show was gonna be

21:53.437 --> 21:56.857
you bringing the best doctor in Miami
to examine him but he's already here.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.859
Beaumont Rosewood.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.069
Oh, yeah, he's the guy
from the billboards.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.446
He's got a nice smile, right?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.407
Yeah, but he's a pathologist.
Your brother's still alive.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.910
Twenty minutes and your hour is up.
Tick, tick, boom.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.747
Listen to me, Villa, I believe Owen.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.207
I know that goes against
every cop bone in your body,

22:14.291 --> 22:16.251
but every doctor bone tells me
that I can help.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.961
I need you to release hostages.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.965
Put the guns down!
What is it you don't understand?

22:22.049 --> 22:23.842
Remember what I said about the codes.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.677
Are we gonna do this?
Is this what you want?

22:25.761 --> 22:29.931
Okay, I'm sorry, kids.
Ten, no, let's make it seven.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.601
-Six, five...
-Okay, I'm not shooting anyone.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.685
The guns are down.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.648
But I need you to release
that man in there.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.692
I'm not going anywhere.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.611
I'm not.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.112
Villa, he's stabilized already, okay.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.074
He has a bullet in between his rectus
femoris muscle and some fatty tissue--

22:47.157 --> 22:49.159
Exactly. He has a bullet in his body.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.328
As long as these kids are being held,
so am I.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.413
And number nine has to go first.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.499
-Why is that?
-Because he has diabetes.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.251
See the perspiration,
see how he's shaking.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.338
I've been watching him,
he's not just scared.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.882
His blood sugar has been
dropping steadily since this started.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.469
Keep walking, get them over here.

23:07.886 --> 23:08.887
-Let's go.
-Where's Dad?

23:11.807 --> 23:12.641
Are you okay?

23:12.933 --> 23:13.934
Here they are.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.561
Thank you, Owen.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.231
Now it's time for me
to do something nice for you.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.858
Now I need to know everything you can
remember from your childhood.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.112
I'm talking about these chicken pox,
tonsils being taken out.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.739
And falling off the skateboard
and scraping his knee. Anything.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.409
We grew up alone,
we didn't go to doctors.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.745
Unless you count the school nurse.
Walter said he was in pain.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.289
-What kind of pain?
-Anything before prison, anything.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.166
Nothing medical in the last 60 days?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.378
No, he... My brother's not
like everybody else.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.297
Walt has trouble
communicating his feelings.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.884
He's always been harassed, I'd tell
him to ignore them. Ignore the zeroes.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.262
Just put on your cape and fly away.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.598
What? He liked Superman.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.059
Superman? Think, Owen.

23:56.143 --> 23:59.020
Look, I don't know. He went
to the dentist three months ago.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.731
Some teenagers knocked his tooth out
while he was riding the bus.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.942
You're not buying
this sad brother routine, are you?

24:04.025 --> 24:05.152
Guy's a criminal.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.320
No mention of the bounty hunter
that brought him in?

24:07.821 --> 24:08.780
Walt skipped bail?

24:08.864 --> 24:11.408
Oh, that's right. Forgot to tell you
about that. I wonder why.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.326
-Shut up, 44.
-Owen.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.328
I need that bounty hunter's name.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.124
What?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.959
Come on, really.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.253
Who lives on a golf course?

24:23.920 --> 24:27.507
Oh, hi, girls. Can I get two boxes of
Samoas

24:27.591 --> 24:30.218
and whatever those
peanut butter things are called?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.429
Butters, girl scout jokes
are not your friend

24:32.512 --> 24:34.890
and there's sort of a hostage
situation and everyone's involved,

24:34.973 --> 24:36.558
so maybe you can invite us in.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.103
I gotta get down there.
Jorge, come on, give me some space.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.480
Give me some space.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.316
Oh, I'm sorry, pal,
you didn't do anything wrong.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.443
You did not do anything wrong.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.570
-Uncle Ira's in trouble.
-Okay, Butters, Butters.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.405
Tighten it up, buddy.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.574
We are on a medical
witch hunt, Butters.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.201
And you've the clues that we need.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.327
You know I do.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.620
Did you notice any vision problems?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.330
Well, Butters said
that he could've easily

24:58.413 --> 24:59.414
crushed him with his hands
and he didn't.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.416
So either he has a soft spot
for older balding guys--

25:01.500 --> 25:03.335
Go easy on the description, honey.
I'm right here.

25:04.002 --> 25:04.836
Okay.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.381
The giant woodsman was definitely
visually impaired.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.343
We were thinking that
you've to be thinking meningitis.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.386
Yeah, how could any doctor
even half paying attention

25:13.470 --> 25:15.055
miss meningitis, Rosie?

25:15.138 --> 25:17.557
Because the aspirin from the jail
would suppress the fever.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.684
This is great stuff,
I'll call you when I know more.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.022
Bad day to get chai, 44.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.316
Okay, you know
what the funny thing is.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.444
I came to work today thinking
I'd turned over a new leaf.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.738
That the universe was telling me
I was doing good.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.115
Yes, some people
might call that Karma.

25:34.741 --> 25:35.742
Just saying.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.912
Yeah, I think you're right.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.583
We make our own beds,
then we die in them.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.002
My father said that to me once.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.921
He was a one percent mentality.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.967
You have a good relationship
with your father?

25:54.594 --> 25:56.763
I wish I could do it all over again.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.682
I would've taken the time
to talk to Owen.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.976
I would've figured out what was
going on with this brother.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.310
But I can't change that.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.897
I don't want this to be my legacy.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.485
You could stop this.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.338
What's Owen's endgame?

26:31.172 --> 26:32.007
Hmm?

26:32.424 --> 26:33.925
Is this about a prison break?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.181
Tell me.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.893
You don't want to make
the same mistake I made.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.814
Maybe both of us can have a chance
at redemption here.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.608
Understand?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.404
How dumb do you think I am?

26:55.864 --> 26:56.865
I love Owen.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.284
I would do anything for him.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.746
He'd do the same for me.
He already has.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.332
There's no redemption for you.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.128
So either do what you came
in here to do, or let's go.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.719
Doc! Sir, sir, hands up, please.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.304
Sir, please turn around.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.975
The wind keeps making my hair
stick on my lip gloss.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.685
Rosie!

27:25.769 --> 27:27.520
- Just one second.
- Are you okay?

27:27.604 --> 27:29.731
Yes. Thank you.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.942
Okay, I know
this isn't a fair question to ask

27:33.026 --> 27:34.361
but you're out here now.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.862
Do you have to go?

27:37.781 --> 27:38.782
Yes, I do.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.742
I get it.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.079
Rosie, I love you.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.081
We love you.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.459
I love you guys too.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.673
Rosie.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.762
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I got caught up
in this thing this morning.

28:00.845 --> 28:01.846
I was late, I'm never late.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.056
Hey, Captain, you're out here
for a reason.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.600
I spoke to the warden,
this Walter character,

28:05.642 --> 28:07.560
he's very dangerous,
you need to be careful.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.354
-Got it.
-Promise me.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.398
I got you, Captain.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.901
Here you go.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.203
You look even better
than you do on your billboards.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.163
What's going on here?

28:27.330 --> 28:30.250
You actually thought we were gonna
bring Walter Panitch here?

28:30.333 --> 28:33.169
A dangerous prisoner
at the instruction of a hostage taker?

28:33.586 --> 28:35.755
No. You're gonna walk back in there,

28:35.839 --> 28:38.758
you're gonna tell Owen that you did
a full examination of his brother,

28:38.842 --> 28:42.303
and you've given him a clean bill.
Top notch, picture of health.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.265
He needs to believe it.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.935
Don't be afraid
to use that smile of yours.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.063
We're clear?

28:54.441 --> 28:56.985
How did it go? You're gonna be okay?

28:57.068 --> 28:58.695
How was he? What's wrong with him?

28:59.446 --> 29:00.739
Did he look scared?

29:01.156 --> 29:02.157
Well, he, um...

29:04.576 --> 29:05.577
I was, uh...

29:06.202 --> 29:07.203
What? What is it?

29:09.873 --> 29:12.250
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I didn't see your brother.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.877
The truck was empty, it was a decoy.

29:16.963 --> 29:17.964
Oh, no.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.507
No.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.053
-Owen, now, look--
-No! No! I trusted you.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.764
No. Listen, I was just as shocked
as you are.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.682
I am on your side.
You gotta let me handle this.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.893
I told you they weren't
taking you seriously.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.060
But you wouldn't listen.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.313
Nobody gives a damn
about your brother.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.357
You wanna get this...

29:36.441 --> 29:38.026
Okay, listen,
you don't have to do that.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.487
Leave that kid alone.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.280
You said you could get me
into that Evidence Room

29:42.363 --> 29:45.325
and I could take what I wanted.
That's why I took this job.

29:46.075 --> 29:49.746
-I dare you, Captain Jack.
-Hey, calm down.

29:49.829 --> 29:50.705
Shut up!

29:50.789 --> 29:52.373
Duke, put it down.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.541
-No, no, no.
-Put it down.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.085
No! I am done with you.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.129
You are weak.

29:59.172 --> 30:03.343
You ever stop to think that maybe your
brother doesn't deserve to be saved?

30:03.426 --> 30:04.302
Huh?

30:10.183 --> 30:11.559
Gunshots heard!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.603
Get out of my way.
Mobilize. Let's go! Let's go!

30:13.686 --> 30:14.687
Move it, move it!

30:14.771 --> 30:16.189
-Wait, hold, hold.
-Hold.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.193
Owen.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.654
This is Detective Annalise Villa.
There's a man down.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.409
No, it wasn't a hostage,
it was an accomplice.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.788
Owen Panitch was protecting a kid.
I would've done the same thing.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.290
Yes, everything is under control.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.918
We're all good, we're safe here.

30:39.629 --> 30:40.463
Thank you.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.924
Don't thank me
because they're still coming in.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.719
I have got one more idea that may
work, but this time we do it my way.

30:47.387 --> 30:50.056
East side, the North side,
the South side. Okay, go, go, go!

30:50.640 --> 30:51.683
Let's go, move! Move!

30:51.766 --> 30:53.726
-Agent Harrows, just a second.
-What is it?

30:53.893 --> 30:55.770
How you operate leaves many questions.

30:56.229 --> 30:59.440
Like I don't know
whether you got many... scruples.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.526
-Scruples?
-Yeah.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.905
That is very interesting coming
from someone like you.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.074
Do you think that I wasn't gonna
do my research?

31:09.409 --> 31:10.785
This used to be your house.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.330
Recently demoted captain
gets his numbers jumbled up,

31:14.414 --> 31:16.916
almost kills an innocent man
with his fist.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.794
And then hides behind the lie
for 18 years?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.630
Does that sound like the guy that should
be teaching me about scruples?

31:22.714 --> 31:26.634
I gave you the most menial tasks
even a child could perform,

31:26.843 --> 31:29.304
but you just couldn't let up,
could you?

31:29.804 --> 31:31.472
There's a problem in there.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.018
This is not about me.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.605
This whole circus is about you.

31:39.063 --> 31:43.067
And if you think I'm gonna stand by
and watch this happen, you're crazy.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.446
You're not gonna have to. Guys...

31:46.779 --> 31:48.114
-I'm not going anywhere.
-...take him out of here.

31:48.197 --> 31:49.824
-Oh, yes, you are.
-Oh, no, I'm not.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.618
-It was great working with you.
-You're gonna kill everybody in there.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.953
-You hear me?
-Get out of my face. Take him out of here.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.455
-Out of here now.
-Let's go, let's go.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.046
Owen.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.382
Who?

32:09.510 --> 32:10.511
I'm sorry, who'd you say?

32:13.473 --> 32:14.974
Owen, how's your day going so far?

32:15.058 --> 32:17.101
That's what you wanna talk about?
What I had for breakfast?

32:17.185 --> 32:19.062
I had my Wheaties,
if that's what you're getting at.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.773
Well, I had see-through coffee
and day old bagel with schmear

32:21.856 --> 32:23.274
so you got me beat there.

32:23.358 --> 32:26.027
You know I was supposed to be
inside with you there today.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.570
You know where I was this morning?

32:28.071 --> 32:30.198
I was sitting in my car,
talking, well, actually,

32:30.281 --> 32:32.325
I was yelling
at my younger brother, Frankie.

32:32.408 --> 32:35.995
I say, younger, but he's 35,
he's an author,

32:36.079 --> 32:37.372
he's just got a book published.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.165
Crime story, if you can believe that.

32:39.332 --> 32:42.043
Detective, your colleague here says
you're the one to help me,

32:42.126 --> 32:43.336
so far I don't see it.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.174
Here's the thing, Owen.

32:50.677 --> 32:54.097
My brother got married yesterday,
I wasn't invited.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.308
The biggest day of his life, he didn't
care if I was there to see it.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.436
But that's the way it's supposed to be
'cause you know what?

33:01.396 --> 33:02.939
I wasn't there for him growing up.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.734
Now we were different, just like you
and your brother are different.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.280
I should've tried
to find a common ground

33:11.364 --> 33:14.993
because he's my blood,
he's my brother, but I failed him.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.745
Maybe that's why I was yelling
because I was angry at me.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.123
What is this? I'm your shrink now?

33:20.623 --> 33:22.375
Call him and say you're sorry.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.003
It's a little too late,
big bridge, lots of water.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.756
The closest thing I have to family
is inside with you there.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.760
So I was thinking, Owen,
if I help you today,

33:32.844 --> 33:37.557
I don't know, maybe, somehow it could
be a symbolic thing or something.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.517
Yeah, and how are you gonna do that?

33:39.600 --> 33:40.935
By making a pledge.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.397
I will figure this out, I will get
your brother here for real this time.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.359
But you gotta promise me,
no more guns, no more bombs.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.738
Can you do that, Owen?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.380
He said he didn't want me.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.633
We all say things we don't mean
sometimes, Villa.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.553
He's here.

34:19.348 --> 34:20.433
My brother's here.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.352
You're sure you got this?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.396
-I had it the first time.
-I know you did.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.786
-Unchain him.
-Excuse me?

34:39.869 --> 34:41.579
Remove the chains
so I can fully examine him.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.762
Your brother sent me
out here to help you, Walt.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.682
Walt, I need you to look at me, okay.
I need you to look at me.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.227
This is a light.
I'm examining your eyes.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.147
Look down.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.482
Look to the left.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.031
Good job. Good job, Walt.

35:17.657 --> 35:18.950
Walt, I need you to focus on me.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.453
Ignore those zeroes.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.665
Put on your cape and just fly away.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.086
Into the sky.

35:31.671 --> 35:35.174
That's right, Walt.
Fly away into the sky.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.472
Okay, breathe in deeply for me.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.102
It's okay, I got you. Here you go.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.196
Okay.

36:05.997 --> 36:09.542
Good news, Walt,
I just saved your life.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.596
I saw what they call Roth's spots
in his eyes there.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.806
Tiny retinal hemorrhages
with white centers.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.016
What does that mean?

36:25.099 --> 36:26.684
Well, on their own,
nothing conclusive.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.519
But it caused me to focus my attention
on his heart.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.606
Now your heart, her heart,
everyone else's in here,

36:31.772 --> 36:32.815
probably sounds the same.

36:33.733 --> 36:34.692
But not Walt's.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.986
You're saying they missed something
as simple as a heart murmur?

36:37.069 --> 36:39.113
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.
It's not that simple.

36:41.866 --> 36:42.825
Blow your nose into this.

36:44.911 --> 36:45.786
But--

36:45.870 --> 36:48.623
Come on, kid, I know you got
a bat in the cave. Just do it.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.672
Okay, no, you keep it, champ.
Now hold it up so everyone can see.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.424
Hold it up.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.093
Your brother Walt
blew his nose into this.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.471
Now you see it doesn't hold the form
like Axton's here

37:03.554 --> 37:05.056
because it's not mucus.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.975
It's cerebral spinal fluid
leaking from his brain.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.478
You said two weeks before his arrest
he went to the dentist.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.522
While he was there,
bacteria got into his bloodstream.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.942
And when you have a bad valve
like Walt,

37:16.025 --> 37:18.653
it can eat away at the bone
'causing the brain to leak

37:18.903 --> 37:20.446
and that's the fluid
that you see here.

37:22.823 --> 37:26.369
This also explains
your brother's hostility.

37:26.452 --> 37:29.080
The rage is
a secondary symptom of stroke.

37:29.580 --> 37:33.209
So otherwise, Walt was
the gentle giant you described.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.794
Wait, I still don't understand.

37:34.877 --> 37:38.047
Just can we stop with the doctor talk.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.132
What we really want to know is,
is he gonna die

37:40.216 --> 37:41.759
because these bastards missed this?

37:41.842 --> 37:44.512
Yes, I know, I'm sorry,
it's very scary information, but no.

37:45.346 --> 37:48.182
It's gonna be a long road to recovery,
but he will live.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.101
You have my word on that.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.021
Now, man to man.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.650
You have to live up
to your end of the deal.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.443
Surrender.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.948
He saved your brother's life.
That's what you came here to do.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.618
Yeah, we'll come on out.

38:08.577 --> 38:10.121
We both know it's over for me.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.749
My life is done.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.002
Our life.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.506
Whatever you decide.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.513
There is
an eerie stillness here.

38:27.596 --> 38:30.599
I've received word, contact was made,
wait a minute.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.519
Yes, they're being released right now.

38:45.823 --> 38:46.824
Agent Harrows.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.243
-You must be Captain Slade.
-Oh, very good.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.202
Hi.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.496
So you were the one
running the show out here today?

38:52.580 --> 38:53.831
You could say that.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.168
We're kind of glad that
Detective Hornstock was here, huh?

38:57.376 --> 39:00.421
Oh, ouch, such harsh words
coming from such a pretty face.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.673
Trust me, the pretty's only skin deep.

39:05.092 --> 39:05.926
See you around.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.845
Yeah, you can count on that.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.309
You know what? Hold on.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.228
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.189
You got it.

39:24.904 --> 39:25.738
Go ahead.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.994
I gotta go away
for a little while, buddy.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.082
I'll go with you.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.709
No, you can't come with me.
I gotta go alone.

39:38.793 --> 39:42.922
You put your cape on, all right?
You put your cape on, you fly away.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.716
I'll put my cape on.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.600
-You fly away, okay.
-I'll fly away.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.269
-I love you, buddy. I love you.
-Gotta go.

39:57.603 --> 39:58.646
Gotta go.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.956
Some relationships
have rocky beginnings.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.423
Others tough endings.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.060
But life is about appreciating
the relationships you do have.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.565
The loved ones who are with you
through highs and lows.

40:42.648 --> 40:44.775
And have your back
from beginning to end.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.402
Some day, huh?

40:49.780 --> 40:50.990
It's one for the books.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.911
Can I get you something? I'm buying.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.208
I'll take some corn nuts.

41:03.502 --> 41:04.503
I owe you one.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.047
It's your house, Slade.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.134
You're a great captain.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.929
It's more than
a trusted circle.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.890
It's your lifeline in this world.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.602
Hey, I'm home.

41:21.979 --> 41:22.938
Tawnya, Kayla.

41:24.231 --> 41:26.650
When you go through
any catastrophe in life

41:26.734 --> 41:30.196
it's the only thing you ever need
is that lifeline.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.409
Tawnya.

41:55.554 --> 41:59.975
Unfortunately, Rosie,
I am not that lifeline for you.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.437
And for that, I want to apologize.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.942
You change a lot of people's worlds.

42:08.692 --> 42:12.029
Even mine, whether you wanna
believe that or not.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.953
I'm sure you're replaying
every moment in your head right now

42:19.036 --> 42:21.247
wondering how this could happen.

42:23.332 --> 42:27.169
But I wanna assure you,
it wasn't all an act.

42:27.920 --> 42:32.258
I'm sure this seems hollow now and you
have every right not to believe it,

42:32.341 --> 42:35.928
but I am truly sorry about this.

42:36.595 --> 42:38.013
A job is just a job.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.724
You were the right guy
in the right place

42:41.809 --> 42:45.229
with the right sized bank account.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.065
Now you're gonna uncover
a lot of things

42:48.148 --> 42:50.609
that weren't true about me.

42:52.861 --> 42:55.364
But the one thing you need to know
was true,

42:56.115 --> 42:59.201
is that I really did think
you were something special.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.582
Thank you
for everything you've done for me.
