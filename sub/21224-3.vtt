WEBVTT

00:08.242 --> 00:10.178
Jeff: All right.
I mean, big-picture-wise,

00:10.211 --> 00:13.747
that was a test of wills,
you know?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.383
And we won it, you know?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.451
So we got to make sure
we're back.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.220
You know, that's the big thing.
We got to get them back,

00:19.253 --> 00:23.124
so I don't see any
major changes in the schedule.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.425
We got some work.
We got to game plan

00:24.458 --> 00:27.595
our freaking ass off
this week now.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.097
We don't like these guys.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.364
Bird-nals.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.166
Do not like
these these guys,

00:32.200 --> 00:35.069
so let's put some time in.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.704
Let's go beat their ass.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.242
3 and 1 through
the first quarter,

00:41.275 --> 00:43.411
we'll be rolling.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.379
Go get number three.
Mac, right? Brett?

00:45.413 --> 00:48.482
-We break bones.
-Let's do it, Coach Mac.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.054
**

01:14.408 --> 01:17.145
Hamm:
The Rams return from Tampa 2-1,

01:17.178 --> 01:20.781
a hard-fought victory
that came at a cost.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.584
Defensive end William Hayes
is in a walking boot

01:23.617 --> 01:26.120
after suffering an early injury
against the Bucs.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.423
-What you got?
-My ankle.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.861
**

01:40.334 --> 01:41.635
Jeff: Okay, Reg.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.204
Scott:
All right, Coach.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.738
Hayes got a left
high-ankle sprain.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.807
We did get him
on it this morning.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.844
He does have an inter tib fib
and posterior tib fib tear.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.347
It looks like it's acute
on chronic but not unstable.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.848
So I wouldn't
rule him out yet,

01:54.882 --> 01:57.718
but I think we got to err
on the smart side of this thing

01:57.751 --> 02:00.354
because these things
can obviously be prolonged.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.156
Just keep him booted
all week,

02:02.190 --> 02:04.525
but treat the...
out of him all week.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.926
So he's not allowed
to do anything.

02:05.959 --> 02:10.564
And then see if he can
move around on Friday,

02:10.598 --> 02:11.799
and see how he feels.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
He wants to play.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.770
Jeff Fisher
knows Hayes well.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.506
He drafted him in 2008

02:18.539 --> 02:21.409
when he was coach
of the Tennessee Titans.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.544
And when he got
the Rams job in 2012,

02:23.577 --> 02:25.879
he brought Hayes with him.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.849
This past summer,
America embraced

02:28.882 --> 02:31.552
the big man as the fun-loving,
dinosaur-denying,

02:31.585 --> 02:33.687
always-scene-stealing star
of "Hard Knocks."

02:33.721 --> 02:34.955
I don't
believe in dinosaurs.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.624
While William does maintain

02:36.657 --> 02:38.192
a healthy belief in mermaids,

02:38.226 --> 02:41.429
one thing he does not believe in
is dinosaurs.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.632
I just think it's some...to be
completely honest with you.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.535
I just can't fathom a T. rex
walking around here,

02:47.568 --> 02:49.370
you know, something that man
ain't never seen.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.472
No, but dinosaurs
never walked this Earth.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.675
All this fairy tale stuff,
the Easter bunny and all that...

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
You know, they fall
in the same category.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.878
Them and Santa Claus
and all that.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.480
What happened to the dinosaurs
in the water?

02:59.513 --> 03:02.316
They in the water now.
Sharks.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.754
So that's
a...dinosaur?

03:06.787 --> 03:08.889
-Yeah.
-Okay. All right.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.358
Alligators.
Look at alligator.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.759
Don't an alligator
look like that?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.427
Just 'cause you're a reptile,
you're a dinosaur now?

03:13.461 --> 03:15.563
-Yeah.
-An alligator's a...dinosaur?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.831
-Yeah.
-That's some...

03:17.865 --> 03:20.901
I think I have a new
favorite football player.

03:20.934 --> 03:25.306
Hamm: For the moment,
Hayes is laid up,

03:25.339 --> 03:28.709
more of an observer
in the current news cycle.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.480
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

03:32.513 --> 03:33.747
I'm laying down.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.883
-But why?
-'Cause I got a boo-boo.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.986
'Cause you got
a boo-boo?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.954
Yeah.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.590
Right there on your foot?

03:42.623 --> 03:44.592
Uh-huh.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.361
I was involved in
a number of efforts

03:47.395 --> 03:48.696
to take out al-Qaeda leadership
when I was...

03:48.729 --> 03:51.499
Hey. I could really be
a president though.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.268
Man: You say you could?
Yeah.
I could say some...man.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.537
He might win the debate
against Trump.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.807
-No doubt about it.
-There's no arguing with him.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.008
Hey. Say that again.
What'd you just say?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.443
There's no arguing with him.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.811
Like the sky is not blue,

04:03.844 --> 04:06.547
and you will continue to go on
and on about it

04:06.580 --> 04:09.550
like it's almost
as if it was truth.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.286
'Cause we get tired of going
back and forth over nothing.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.021
-Who do?
-I do.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.589
She do.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.058
'Cause my arguments
be so strong,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.260
and I be passionate
about my argument.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.897
Hamm:
There's no debate this week.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.401
The Rams will have their hands
full with the Cardinals,

04:27.435 --> 04:29.303
a bitter division rival.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.707
I don't like nobody in that
uniform over there, nobody.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.309
Man: Yeah. I'm with you.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.710
It don't matter what they do.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.446
Only thing that concerns me
is what we do.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.515
-Uh-huh.
-They don't even exist.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.884
Hamm: In 2015, the Cardinals
handed the Rams

04:43.917 --> 04:45.886
one of their worst
defeats of the season.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.857
Mathieu: It's a party, baby.
Y'all invited today.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.660
It's a party.
Y'all invited.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.529
Announcer:
Rams will be held without
a touchdown this afternoon,

04:55.563 --> 04:58.499
one Zach Hocker field goal.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.867
Whitewash.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.003
Yeah.
See, this was personal.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.939
This...
does not respect you.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.841
After we lost to them last year,

05:07.875 --> 05:09.477
you should have heard
the...that he said

05:09.510 --> 05:11.645
in his press conference,
and I'ma let you hear it.

05:11.679 --> 05:15.082
Everybody been wanting
to talk all that stuff

05:15.115 --> 05:16.617
about how great
their defense is.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.519
I think they saw
a good defense tonight.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.953
It was in red and white.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.623
I mean, there's an 11-3 team

05:22.656 --> 05:25.893
and a team that's always 8-8.

05:25.926 --> 05:26.994
You figure it out.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.729
That's what he think about you.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.399
Every time you lined up
and you go play against Arizona,

05:31.432 --> 05:32.966
he's lining up saying,
"We gonna whoop their ass,"

05:33.000 --> 05:34.535
'cause he has no respect for us.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.604
He don't have respect
for this coaching staff.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.406
He don't have respect
for you as players.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.740
When we go out there,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.675
you show him what we're about,
all right?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.477
We're...running
down the field on these guys.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.778
They want to play man-to-man,

05:44.812 --> 05:46.614
we're gonna run down
the field on them.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.082
We're gonna attack these guys
down the field, one-on-one.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.820
Hamm: The coaches have
identified a potential weakness.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.021
Lately the Cardinals
have been slow

05:54.054 --> 05:56.089
to get lined up between snaps.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.392
Announcer: Snap to Garoppolo.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.828
He hands it off to Blount.
Straight ahead down to the 5.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.096
Keeps moving the pile,
and he's into the end zone

06:03.130 --> 06:06.066
for the New England touchdown.
-Wow.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.735
Peete: Look at the tape.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.538
There's several times
that they have a hard time

06:10.571 --> 06:13.574
just getting up,
getting set, getting lined up.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.842
A couple teams have hit them

06:14.875 --> 06:16.444
when they're kind
of milling around

06:16.477 --> 06:17.711
and haven't even got lined up.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.048
So we're gonna get into press.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.485
Boudreau: We're telling him to
speed up the process, okay?

06:24.518 --> 06:28.856
Why go through the whole
black 80, all that...

06:28.889 --> 06:31.992
Right here. Let's go.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.961
Weinke: What Bou's gonna
tell the line is,

06:33.994 --> 06:36.997
"Listen. We need to go."
Right?

06:37.030 --> 06:39.132
I absolutely love it.
We want to get up.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.101
Don't even give them a chance
to make an adjustment.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.604
We're gone.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.739
Hamm: To take advantage,
the Rams implement

06:45.773 --> 06:48.642
a quick-snap cadence
called cheetah.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.043
All right. Let's go.
Cheetah, cheetah, cheetah.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.145
Flounder, H balloon,
on the cheetah.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.747
Ready?
-Balloon, balloon, balloon.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.516
-Yeah.
-Four down.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.886
55 is the mike.
We have a Ram.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.187
Set.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.723
Perfect.
Ha-ha.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.025
-Smart there, Tim.
-We got them.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.794
-Yeah.
-Good call.

Let go.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.908
Hamm: Cheetah has given
the offense a little bounce.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.512
Man: Nice shot.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.079
Nice shot, Case.

07:27.748 --> 07:31.585
I need one of those,
man.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.921
Hamm: Case Keenum especially
looks sharp.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.689
Oh, yes.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.659
The quarterback hopes
to further entrench himself

07:38.692 --> 07:41.495
as the starter after
two straight wins.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.264
Good job today.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.666
That was good operating,
you know,

07:45.699 --> 07:47.234
mechanics at the line
of scrimmage.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.736
All the checks were good.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.538
We took some shots
down the field.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.039
When they weren't there,
you checked it down.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.742
Okay?
-It's about being consistent.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.610
Keeping wins
and loses and consistent,

07:56.644 --> 07:58.211
but you got to
keep doing this.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.947
You can't do this.
-Right, right, right.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.882
You have to do that,
you know?

08:01.915 --> 08:04.117
Hamm: At 2-1,
the Rams are doing more

08:04.151 --> 08:06.654
than keeping their
heads above water.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.591
Even their families
are getting comfortable.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.693
Are you guys gonna
fight over Chloe?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.528

Christina: Having little ones
is so hard traveling.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.635
Just glad that we can
finally settle in

08:21.669 --> 08:24.938
and have parties like this
with all the girls.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.674
Did you find
a pediatrician yet?

08:26.707 --> 08:27.708
-Yep.
-You did?

08:27.741 --> 08:28.942
-I didn't.
-And a day care.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.177
Oh, I found a day care.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.945
Well, Faith recommended hers,
and we went.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.115
-Oh, okay.
-I need a pediatrician.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.950
Are you trying
to give her a kiss?

a good time over there.

will fly to Arizona

08:46.093 --> 08:47.695
to face the Cardinals,

08:47.728 --> 08:50.063
but today, for
the defensive line,

08:50.097 --> 08:52.800
it's all about
food and family.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.902
Wait a minute.
You guys have burned chicken?

08:54.935 --> 08:56.604
-We didn't burn it.
-Should I go to the store?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.706
For what?

08:58.739 --> 09:01.108
-Is the chicken burned?
-No.

-Yes, sir.

down here in your...man.

down here burning.

That's just extra flavor.

You never used
old grease before?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.152
Yeah, I know.
When your grill on fire,

09:12.185 --> 09:14.788
that means you just
got extra flavor on it.

when you're done with it.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.704
His ankle
hasn't fully healed.

09:30.738 --> 09:34.942
That means Robert Quinn
will have to bring the heat.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.645
The only he's on time is
when he's looking at film.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.046
Robert: Or getting to
the quarterback.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.649
-Or getting to the quarterback.
-Never late.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.083
Yeah. He ain't gonna
be late on that one.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.288
Jeff: Somebody said this week,

09:48.321 --> 09:51.124
"This is a defining moment
for your football team."

09:51.158 --> 09:52.660
I said...

09:52.693 --> 09:54.294
It's a defining moment
for those...

09:54.327 --> 09:56.797
and we're gonna
define it for them."

09:56.830 --> 09:58.398
That's their issue, not ours.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.100
Let's go win.
Come on.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.368
Let's go. "Win" on three.
One, two, three!

10:01.401 --> 10:02.736
-All: Win.
-Let's go, baby.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.071
Let's go.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.008
Announcer: Cardinal fans,
let's have a warm

10:08.041 --> 10:11.812
Arizona welcome for
the Los Angeles Rams.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.882
**

10:19.687 --> 10:20.888
Let's go through inactives.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.156
We saw Will Hayes
in a walking boot.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.893
So after that injury he suffered
against Tampa Bay,

10:25.926 --> 10:28.195
no Will Hayes.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.429
Keep them going, man.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.064
Huh? Huh?
Keep them going.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.103
Let's go.
Hey.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.173
We got one mission,
one mission.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.976
All day.
Get after somebody's ass.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.078
We don't like them.
They don't like us.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.413
It's us against them.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.181
Make them...feel you, man.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.817
And we all we got.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.451
-All: We all we need, baby.
-We all we got.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.020
-All: We all we need.
-We all we got.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.254
-All: We all we need.
-Together on three.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.923
-One, two, three!
-All: Together!

10:55.956 --> 10:57.991
Announcer: Set for the Rams
second possession...

10:58.025 --> 10:59.927
Cheetah,
cheetah, cheetah.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.062
...in a scoreless first quarter
here in Arizona.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.297
Satellite, Dorito,
double delta, on the cheetah.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.933
Ready?

11:05.966 --> 11:08.969
Shotgun set
for the L.A. Rams.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.838
Odd, odd, odd.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.441
30's the mark, doctor.
Set.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.209
Announcer: With the linemen
standing, here it comes.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.411
They throw right-side
outside the numbers.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.080
It is caught.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.816
Brian Quick breaks away
the far sideline.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.485
10, 5, touchdown L.A.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.955
Touchdown.
Touchdown, baby.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.489
Yeah! Whoo!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.458
Announcer: Keenum with
the fist pump and a celebration.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.293
Way to go.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.930
Hey. That was a rock, man.
Yeah.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.499
Hamm: The cheetah call works.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.301
The Cardinals are
caught off guard.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.974
Announcer: Almost looked like
a quick snap there.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.477
Announcer #2: And Quick took it
to the house.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.884
Hey, good job on that one.
I tried to make a point,

11:56.917 --> 11:58.986
and when I saw they were
just standing, I went.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.387
Hey.
Cheetah, cheetah, man.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.122
...A.
Cheetah.

12:02.155 --> 12:06.093
They're all standing around.
They had no...idea.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.995
Smith: Got to keep running away
from these guys, okay?

12:08.028 --> 12:10.130
Hey, we're gonna win.
All right? We're good.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.966
Hey. We keep making plays
and do what we do.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.301
Hey. Keep up the plays.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.969
We are better
than them outside.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.271
Let's go.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.408
We're a matter of inches
on sack-ball-out.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.843
We're a matter of inches.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.912
Keep going now.
Keep going.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.213
Let's go.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.048
Hey, Rob.
-Make a...play. Yes, sir.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.817
Hey, your shoulder feel
...amazing right now.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.184
Robert: Yes, sir.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.519
Hamm: With Will Hayes out,

12:32.552 --> 12:36.323
the Rams need
Robert Quinn to step up.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.059
Come on, defense.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.328
We got them.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.562
Announcer:
Shotgun snap to Carson.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.031
Drops back.
Slides up.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.465
Throws far side.
It's caught.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.135
First down John Brown
at the 41.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.569
He stayed inbounds.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.140
Meanwhile,
there's an injured Ram.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.544
You good, man?

12:57.577 --> 13:01.214
-Is that...
-It's Robert Quinn.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.583
Announcer:
Robert Quinn. Oh, boy.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.854
**

13:10.390 --> 13:13.426
Boy, I don't know what happened,
but he is hurt.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.329
He only played
in eight games last year.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.131
Eventually underwent
back surgery.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.568
What happened?
I didn't see.

13:21.601 --> 13:26.506
Announcer #2: So Quinn working
against Jared Veldheer,

13:26.539 --> 13:29.576
and it looks like he ran into
his own player on the pass rush

13:29.609 --> 13:32.312
where they met in
the back part of the pocket.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.887
Announcer: The Los Angeles
defense has to be

13:39.920 --> 13:42.990
lights-out week in, week out,
and they need every piece.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.326
Announcer #2:
But clearly, he's compromised
with an upper-body injury.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.128
I think it might be
his shoulder.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.297
Yeah. He's holding,
like, down here.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.467
You just got to wait
for that pain.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.469
It's starting to come back.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.072
Hamm: It's a pinched nerve,
or stinger,

13:59.106 --> 14:01.141
painful and hard to move,

14:01.174 --> 14:03.610
but not enough to keep Quinn
on the sideline.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.949
Is he about
to go back in?

14:14.922 --> 14:17.991
Wait. Rob really just
got up right away?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.494
Yeah.
He's going back in.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.031
Announcer #2: Robert Quinn.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.198
He's not gonna
sit out for long.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.566
He's beat up.
He's banged up,

14:26.599 --> 14:29.502
but he's coming back
in the game right now.

14:29.536 --> 14:33.373
Announcer: Rams protecting
a 10-3 lead late first half.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.641
Empty backfield.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.009
Palmer in the shotgun.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.345
Palmer left side.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.980
End zone.
Caught.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.482
Touchdown, Cardinals.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.352
It's 10 up, and we've got
a new game in the desert.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.457
Barnes: Here we go.
We're gonna get the ball back.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.226
We're gonna go score.
Can't let it bother us.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.296
Hey. We're gonna get the ball
back. We're gonna go score.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.565
You know, when you're
running a quick snap,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.934
you got to get set too.
Okay?

15:00.968 --> 15:03.003
Because if you got
to set to snap --
I feel like I gave it
plenty of time.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.671
-You got to shut it down.
-Was it a good pause?

15:04.704 --> 15:07.374
Yeah. You got to pause.
I mean was that one
a good pause?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.076
Not really.
You were right on the board

15:09.109 --> 15:10.243
on that one
they scored on.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.179
It was almost
a little too quick.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.314
Okay.
I think you guys burned us
on that one, man.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.549
My job
is on the line now.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.085
Just remember that.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.020
Hamm: The Rams back off
the quick snap...

15:20.053 --> 15:21.488
Announcer:
Keenum's in the shotgun.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.190
Set.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.125
Hamm: ...and rely on
the quick feet of Case Keenum.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.626
Announcer:
Steps up in the pocket.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.462
Evades the rush.
He tucks it and runs.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.365
And is that Michael Vick
or Case Keenum?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.701
Hamm: But too often, they shoot
themselves in the foot.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.040
Nice.
We got a hold.

15:40.073 --> 15:44.444
Holding.
Offense, number 73.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.579
Announcer: Cardinals bring four.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.182
The pocket collapsing.
Keenum's in traffic.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.717
He spins out to
the left numbers,

15:50.750 --> 15:52.619
resets at midfield,

15:52.652 --> 15:54.254
retreats into his own territory,

15:54.287 --> 15:56.523
steps up, flicks it left side.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.458
Kendricks, the tight end,
has it.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.660
Lineman downfield.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.463
Announcer:
Penalty marker at the 36.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.266
Hamm: The defense is
short-handed and hurting,

16:06.299 --> 16:09.502
but they keep it close.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.171
Announcer:
Palmer, five-step drop.

16:11.204 --> 16:15.208
Throws down the right sideline
into the end zone.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.410
It is intercepted.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.279
Trumaine Johnson.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.513

-Yeah!

Good job, team!
Let's go!

Way to play the ball.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.057
-Yeah.
-Nice job.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.159
Okay. Here we go.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.061
Hamm:
L.A.'s defense shows grit,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.729
but Arizona still leads by 3.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.331
With under six minutes left,

16:38.365 --> 16:39.766
the Cardinals are forced to punt

16:39.799 --> 16:43.036
to dynamic returner
Tavon Austin.

backs up to his 20
as he makes the catch,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.113
runs right-side
towards his own sideline.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.782
He's got a lane, the 40,
the 45, midfield.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.185
Cuts outside
into Cardinals territory,

16:58.218 --> 17:00.253
spins out of
a face mask, tackled.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.223

Face mask. Face mask!

disrespected, underrated,

18:06.586 --> 18:09.422
3-1 team in the NFL.

18:09.456 --> 18:13.160
Every time they were asked
to answer the bell,

18:13.193 --> 18:14.661
they delivered.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.264

Wow.

all that matters.
That's all that matters.

You guys just went on the road
two back-to-back weeks and won,

we can do it

the field and roses.

-Yes. So nervous.

those nerves? What can you do?

Nothing. You can't do
anything about it, right?

score some touchdowns,

in between here,

of our top goals,

of the season

of the season.

in this ball game --

stop the run,

stop the run,

24:33.940 --> 24:38.210
stop the...run!

24:38.244 --> 24:40.513
Part of stopping the run is

24:40.547 --> 24:43.249
knowing this
quarterback scramble.

24:43.282 --> 24:47.654
This quarterback is very similar
to Russell Wilson.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.623
He is not as good a passer,

24:50.657 --> 24:53.926
but I think he's
faster than Russell.

runner than Russell.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.358
Life's good.
Life is good.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.196
Hey, what the...
we doing outside,

28:17.229 --> 28:19.832
like bring your dog
to work day or some...

28:21.367 --> 28:23.770
Hamm: Injured players
don't get the day off.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.404
Not that Will Hayes wants one.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.274
He's doing all he can
to get back on the field,

28:28.307 --> 28:30.176
especially since
fellow D-linemen

28:30.209 --> 28:31.978
Robert Quinn
and Michael Brockers

28:32.011 --> 28:33.512
have already been
ruled out this week.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.181
Huh?
It's not as swollen
in the back here?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.383
No.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.752
Right now, I'm calling him
doubtful for Sunday.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.021
So that's not questionable.
Questionable is like no.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.522
No,
questionable is 50%.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.825
Doubtful is about
25% chance.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.860
-25% chance to play?
-Yes.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.462
No. Just give me a doubtful.
Like, let me, like --

28:50.496 --> 28:52.098
That way I can, like,
at least be mentally,

28:52.131 --> 28:55.134
like, into it.
Give me 50%.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.269
We don't have to do that
until tomorrow.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.272
Turn in that.
-So what you gonna have me as?

29:00.306 --> 29:02.241
Hey, don't be
disrespectful, though.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.143
-What?
-'Cause you don't have to be

29:04.176 --> 29:06.278
all the way truthful
with me, do you?

29:06.312 --> 29:08.047
Yes.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.215
Is that like
a league rule?

29:09.248 --> 29:11.150
Yes.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.518
That's stupid as hell.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.253
It's the rules.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.023
That's like there's no leaving,
like, even leaving room,

29:17.056 --> 29:19.926
like, to strategize.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.493
-Yeah, but we want to be --
-Like, what happens if, like,

29:21.527 --> 29:23.095
they found out
that you went to untrue?

29:23.129 --> 29:27.033
-I think it's finable.
-How is that finable?

29:27.066 --> 29:30.102
Because you're not
being accurate.

29:32.171 --> 29:36.175
**

29:36.208 --> 29:39.846
Williams: Hey. No excuses.
Let's go. Get on the line.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.048
Let's bring that...

29:42.081 --> 29:43.582
Hey.
It happens in the game.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.351
We got to get ready to go.
We're out of ruby.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.286
A guy went down.
Here we...go.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.921
We're gonna keep going.
Let's go.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.589
We ain't gonna blink.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.092
Cody reverse.
Marqui -- or I'm sorry,

29:53.125 --> 29:54.560
Josh, you'll be back in.

29:54.593 --> 29:59.198
This could be our naked left
or our Cody reverse.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.900
Hamm:
With the defensive line ailing,

30:00.933 --> 30:02.601
the Rams may try
to steal a possession

30:02.634 --> 30:05.471
against Buffalo
by executing a fake punt.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.007
-Are we keeping it on?
-Keep the fake reverse on?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.508
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.043
'Cause I think the reverse
will hold even better

30:11.077 --> 30:12.511
than almost even
blocking them.

30:12.544 --> 30:16.015
Fake kicks are something
of a Jeff Fisher specialty.

30:16.048 --> 30:20.052
He's called the most in the NFL
over the past decade.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.453
For the last five years,

30:21.487 --> 30:23.289
he's partnered
with John Fassel

30:23.322 --> 30:27.026
to build one of the best special
teams units in the league.

30:27.059 --> 30:31.130
This week, they've cooked up
a fake punt they call ram right.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.999
Jeff: We do this,

30:33.032 --> 30:37.103
get 33 out of there
by doing this,

30:37.136 --> 30:39.571
start that motion there.
All right.

30:39.605 --> 30:43.442
And then ram right,
and we are off and rolling.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.244
Huh? Perfect.
-You know it.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.146
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.916
So if we just do this, he's
gonna know it's not up to us.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.351
He's the only one.
33's the only one.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.920
Colt's the only one
that can make that play.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.554
I don't think
he'll make it.

30:55.587 --> 30:56.889
-Right.
-All right?

30:56.923 --> 30:58.290
-Yeah.
-All right.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.259
Good luck, guys.
-Yeah, and he doesn't even spy.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.061
That's the dough.
-We got to block, no holding,

31:02.094 --> 31:03.462
just get the edge
and take off.

31:03.495 --> 31:07.633
-Yep.
-Here we go.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.902
John: So here we go.
Let's talk about it.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.603
And this is an alert attack.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.505
We get the opportunity
to do this.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.275
When the ball is snapped,
"Ready, set, go."

31:16.308 --> 31:17.643
They're not
anticipating the snap.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.345
That's when we go.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.447
We don't want our ram right
first down called back

31:21.480 --> 31:24.283
because all of a sudden
readjusted our stance.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.585
This is very possibly
gonna be called,

31:26.618 --> 31:29.688
and we got to be
at our best.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.224
We got to make coach right
and make it work.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.227
Hamm:
This will only be the Rams'
second home game of the season,

31:35.261 --> 31:37.396
which gives Coach Fassel
a rare Friday night

31:37.429 --> 31:39.698
to steal some time
with his family.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.970
Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk,
dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.704
-No!
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

31:45.737 --> 31:48.975
John: There's probably myself
and maybe three or four others

31:49.008 --> 31:50.709
that get done late at night,

31:50.742 --> 31:52.244
put the mattress on the floor
and go to bed,

31:52.278 --> 31:54.580
and wake up and go
right back to work.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.715
Normal football week,
so Monday morning

31:56.748 --> 31:59.451
I'll leave the house at probably
about 5:00 in the morning.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.953
I'll spend all day Monday,

32:00.987 --> 32:03.455
Tuesday, and Wednesday
at the office.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.024
-Dada.
-Yeah?

32:05.057 --> 32:06.525
Can you just stop me
and do --

32:06.558 --> 32:08.961
Okay. Just a minute.
Daddy's finishing talking, okay?

32:08.995 --> 32:10.362
-Hold on. Hold on.
-Okay, what?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.464
I want stops.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.233
-You won't fall down, I promise.
-Okay. Okay.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.501
Ready?
You got to hold on tight.

32:15.534 --> 32:16.735
-Okay.
-This is like Disneyland.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.405
Ready? Hold on tight.
-I am.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.040
Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk,
dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.441
Move your legs.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.143
Ready?

32:24.176 --> 32:26.212
Go!

32:26.245 --> 32:28.080
So Monday full day.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.249
Tuesday full day.
Wednesday full day.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.717
I'll come home
Wednesday night,

32:31.750 --> 32:33.219
and then I'll turn around
and leave Thursday morning

32:33.252 --> 32:34.586
about 5:00
in the morning,

32:34.620 --> 32:36.488
spend Thursday night
at the office.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.225
Friday, you know, we'll work
till probably about 3:00,

32:39.258 --> 32:41.327
and so far this season
we've had road trips

32:41.360 --> 32:43.129
where we've left on a Friday.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.998
So I lose the Friday at home,
the Saturday at home.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.399
And if you get back
late Sunday night,

32:47.433 --> 32:49.301
I might even have
to go back to the office

32:49.335 --> 32:50.669
and not come back home.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.505
Facetime is the greatest
invention ever.

32:53.539 --> 32:56.642
Elizabeth:
I think she misses him
and misses his presence,

32:56.675 --> 32:59.745
but doesn't get, like,
why he's gone.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.181
Is it better when Dada's home
or Dada's not home,

33:02.214 --> 33:03.515
at football practice?

33:03.549 --> 33:05.684
Better
that you are home.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.119
Better that I'm home?

33:07.153 --> 33:08.387
Yeah.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.757
She gets now at this age
why he's gone,

33:11.790 --> 33:14.026
and she'll refer to,
like, the season

33:14.060 --> 33:16.195
and the off-season
like she knows what that means.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.397
She knows what
training camp means.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.666
She's definitely
a football baby.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.669
John:
Thank goodness I've got a very
strong, understanding wife,

33:23.702 --> 33:26.705
and two little kiddos
that just go along with it.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.108
Whoa!

33:29.141 --> 33:31.310
Look at you girls flying.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.746
It's been a lot of fun, but
it's been a lot of traveling.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.548
I cherish the time
with the kiddos

33:36.582 --> 33:38.584
when we have our home games
on Fridays

33:38.617 --> 33:41.253
or Saturday afternoons.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.328
Announcer:
From the L.A. Memorial Coliseum
in Southern California,

33:49.361 --> 33:51.797
welcome to Week 5
of the National Football League.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.732
The Buffalo Bills arrive at 2-2

33:53.765 --> 33:57.169
to face the upstart L.A. Rams
at 3-1.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.138
And for Los Angeles,

33:59.171 --> 34:00.839
the Rams defensive line,

34:00.872 --> 34:02.374
no Robert Quinn,

34:02.408 --> 34:04.476
no Michael Brockers,
no William Hayes.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.778
That means Eugene Sims
gets his start.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.580
Big assignment day
for Alec Ogletree

34:08.614 --> 34:10.249
and the linebacking group.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.750
-Let's go, boys.
-All right, boys.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.153
-Hey, let's have some fun, man.
-Hell yeah.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.654
Let's have some
freaking fun today, huh?

34:15.687 --> 34:19.525
Stay together.
Hey, let's communicate.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.660
Let's have some fun, man.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.496
Announcer #2: You know that
the Rams were shutout 28-0

34:24.530 --> 34:27.099
in Week 1 on Monday night
at San Francisco.

34:27.133 --> 34:33.139
They have rattled off three
consecutive victories since.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.607
Let's freaking go!

34:35.641 --> 34:37.376
Let's freaking go!

34:37.409 --> 34:38.877
Let's go!

34:38.910 --> 34:40.846
Let's go!

34:44.550 --> 34:46.818
Hamm: Case Keenum has reason
to be rocking.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.188
He's reached heights
few would have predicted

34:49.221 --> 34:50.722
before the season began,

34:50.756 --> 34:52.691
leading his team
to a first-place tie

34:52.724 --> 34:55.294
in their division.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.129
-Feel good?
-Feel great, buddy.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.397
Good.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.567
Woman:
* ...land of the free

35:01.600 --> 35:04.570
Hamm: A fourth straight win
would feel even better,

35:04.603 --> 35:06.405
but first things first --

35:06.438 --> 35:08.474
the Rams still haven't
scored a touchdown

35:08.507 --> 35:11.177
on their new home field.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.616
-I see no offense.
-They're fast.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.886
Shotgun, flex right, close,
stick, Gotti. Ready?

35:20.919 --> 35:23.689
Announcer: Rams still last
in the NFL in total offense,

35:23.722 --> 35:27.493
just shy of 270 yards per game.
-Get 52.

35:27.526 --> 35:28.727
Set, hut.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.429
Keenum's in the shotgun.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.464
White 20.
White, hut.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.500
He calls for the snap.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.701
Keenum looks to throw for it.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.369
He's got Gurley at the 35,

35:37.403 --> 35:41.207
near the sideline
on the backfield.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.875
First down, L.A.,
opening drive of the game.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.944
Announcer #2: A nice, confident
throw for Case Keenum.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.546
The Rams are on the move.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.182
-Hut, hut.
-Rob Boras is coming out

35:50.216 --> 35:52.284
with multiple formations,
multiple personnel,

35:52.318 --> 35:54.820
throwing everything right now
at the Buffalo Bills.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.788
-Hut, hut.
-And they're spreading them out,

35:56.822 --> 35:59.358
getting the ball
all over the field.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.726
Hut, hut.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.229
Hamm: The opening drive
ends in points,

36:03.262 --> 36:04.763
but only 3.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.966
Announcer: Greg Zuerlein
with the field goal attempt.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.635
Shoot.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.971
Hamm: The Coliseum's first
touchdown in 22 years

36:13.004 --> 36:15.207
is still there for the taking.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.511
Announcer: Taylor under center.
Play-action.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.947
From a clean pocket,
he's trying to escape.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.683
Gets out left side.
Now throws to the back pylon.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.953
Touchdown, Buffalo.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.821
We have to tackle
their quarterback.

36:31.923 --> 36:35.994
Hamm: The Bills' running game
is as advertised.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.929
The one-two combination
of LeSean McCoy

36:37.963 --> 36:39.431
and Tyrod Taylor slice

36:39.465 --> 36:41.567
through the Rams'
makeshift defensive line.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.636
**

36:46.605 --> 36:49.575
-There he goes.
-Look at that...

36:49.608 --> 36:53.712
...

36:53.745 --> 36:55.814
Announcer: They option right.
The pitch right,

36:55.847 --> 36:59.585
and Buffalo strikes again.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.019
Announcer #2: This kind of comes
back to all the guys

37:01.052 --> 37:04.590
that are inactive on
that defensive line.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.592
Hamm:
With his defense outmatched,

37:06.625 --> 37:08.860
Keenum knows the Rams'
only chance of winning

37:08.894 --> 37:11.697
is to get more points
out of his offense.

37:11.730 --> 37:15.767
Let's go.
Let's go.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.736
Let's go.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.338
All right.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.672
All right. Let's go
get a touchdown here.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.973
Hey, don't settle
for a field goal.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.042
Let's go get a touchdown.
Pound the rock.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.777
Hut, hut.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.613
Announcer: Keenum takes
the snap, throws the slant.

37:27.646 --> 37:28.880
Britt at the 40.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.450
One broken tackle
away from pay dirt.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.619
Keenum, quick snap.
The blitz comes.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.053
He throws to the left numbers.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.888
It is caught.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.358
The Rams are back
in the red zone.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.693
Can they get a touchdown?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.829
Hey, we're gonna run
this ass in the end zone.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.498
We're gonna run over their ass
in the end zone, okay?

37:46.532 --> 37:49.000
Let's freaking
go score a touchdown.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.304
Announcer: First and goal
from the 1, L.A.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.539
Hut.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.307
-Keenum goes under center.
-Red 20.

37:55.341 --> 37:58.444
Hut, hut.
-Hands off to Gurley.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.778
Plunges in.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.680
Touchdown, Todd Gurley.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.715
Touchdown, L.A.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.817
Boom! Let's go!

38:05.851 --> 38:08.420
Let's go!
Let's freaking go!

38:08.454 --> 38:12.324
[ Cheers and applause ]

38:12.358 --> 38:13.825
Good job, Todd.
Way to go, 30.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.727
Way to go, baby.
Way to go.

38:15.761 --> 38:20.366
Hamm: The Rams' first home
touchdown ties the score.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.900
Man: Here we go, boys.
Hey. Blink to shotgun,

38:21.933 --> 38:23.869
flake right off,
fake Georgia right,

38:23.902 --> 38:25.871
Y trident left.
Ready?

38:25.904 --> 38:27.773
Case: Midway through
the third quarter,

38:27.806 --> 38:29.074
the game remains deadlocked.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.576
Hey, Coop.
Phase two.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.411
Announcer: 16-all from the 31.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.913
Here's Keenum.
-Hut, hut.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.982
Well protected.
Fires far side.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.485
It's intercepted.

38:39.518 --> 38:44.790
The killer Robey-Coleman
has a pick-six.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.760
Announcer #2:
We've talked about Case Keenum
not hurting the Rams.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.496
Shoot!

38:50.529 --> 38:53.899
There you go, the one mistake
that could be costly.

38:58.136 --> 39:01.139
[ Speaks indistinctly ]

39:01.172 --> 39:05.043
Y'all, I think I threw that
right where I wanted to.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.878
He made a hell of a play.
He jumped it, man.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.547
It was high.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.781
Announcer #2: You have to be
careful doing that.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.383
It has to be on time,

39:11.417 --> 39:13.151
and it has to have
some pizzazz on that throw

39:13.184 --> 39:14.953
because it's a long throw
that allows the DB

39:14.986 --> 39:17.623
to pick the ball off,
like we just saw from Robey.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.491
Case Keenum has a lot
on his plate right now.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.992
This L.A. Rams offense

39:21.026 --> 39:22.794
is fighting to try
to find a way to win this game.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.962
-That's all right.
-I'm fine.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.932
-We got a goal.
-True story.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.434
Let's go.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.701
Hey, one play at a time.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.703
Yep. You got me?
I got amnesia, baby.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.605
The best kind.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.407
Yeah. Red 20.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.042
Hut, hut.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.178
Hamm: Keenum puts his mistake
behind him and marches on,

39:40.211 --> 39:41.980
positioning the Rams

39:42.013 --> 39:44.750
for a fourth-quarter
field goal attempt.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.885
Announcer: The snap is a good
one. The hold is true.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.588
And the kick is up,
and it is good.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.891
Okay. Okay.
All right.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.460
Case: Hey, let's put together
a drive here.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.462
Come on. Let's go, boys.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.764
Hey, let's go right here.
Let's go score a touchdown.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.632
Mary left.
Mary left.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.470
Make sure the mic's hot.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.472
Hamm:
Down 4, late in the game,

40:06.505 --> 40:08.740
Keenum has the ball
in his hands,

40:08.774 --> 40:11.042
but the offense stalls.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.811
Announcer: Sets his feet.
The pass is deflected.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.613
It falls, incomplete.

40:14.646 --> 40:18.817
It's fourth down and 5
with 3:48 to go.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.186
...

40:25.624 --> 40:29.227
Announcer: Fisher's trusting
his defense to give his offense

40:29.260 --> 40:31.497
one more chance at it late.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.099
Let's get it.
Ram right.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.034
Ram right.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.103
And Hekker and the punt team
are on

40:38.136 --> 40:40.238
as Jeff Fisher will opt
to kick it away.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.676
23-19 the score.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.044
It's a fake.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.979
It's Bradley Marquez
running right side.

40:48.013 --> 40:51.783
Hit at the 25,
and he did not get there.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.852
Damn.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.757
Announcer #2:
Jeff Fisher told us on Friday

40:58.790 --> 41:02.661
that they had a couple up
their sleeve, a couple fakes.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.830
They always have a couple
fakes up and ready,

41:04.863 --> 41:09.167
but, boy, that situation, man,
that one backfired.

41:12.538 --> 41:15.006
All right.
Here we go.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.575
Here we go.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.876
Let's hold them
to a field goal now.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.244
Field goal.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.680
Man: Set.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.649
Announcer: They hand-off McCoy.
Up the left numbers.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.816
The 10, the 5.

41:24.850 --> 41:28.720
Cutting back,
he's tripped up.

41:28.754 --> 41:30.889
-Ooh.
-Hut.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.190
Rams bring the blitz,

41:32.223 --> 41:34.059
and hit the quarterback
as the throw goes

41:34.092 --> 41:37.563
to the end zone
and is caught.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.865
Taylor threw the dagger.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.270
Bills, 30. Rams, 19.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.775
We're all right.
We're fine, man.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.109
We're in a good spot,
man.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.044
Yeah. We are. We're gonna
come right back, man.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.813
I was a little dead
out here today.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.915
You know, I was a little dead.
We're all a little dead.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.717
We're a good team though,
man.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.587
Love you too.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.893
Jeff: Not the end of the world.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.828
Not the end
of the world at all.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.798
We didn't play our best today.

42:12.831 --> 42:15.133
I'll take it. We should have
punted the ball away,

42:15.166 --> 42:17.703
but I trusted us
to make that play,

42:17.736 --> 42:19.004
so I'll take it.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.006
I'll take responsibility.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.074
We've got probably
the biggest challenge

42:23.108 --> 42:24.743
here over the next couple
of weeks,

42:24.776 --> 42:27.713
okay, a huge challenge,

42:27.746 --> 42:29.848
on the road to London,

42:29.881 --> 42:31.983
potential for distractions.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.652
Let's just stay focused
on our football, men.

42:33.685 --> 42:34.953
We're gonna be
a good football team.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.688
We're gonna win
a lot of games.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.056
We're gonna win enough games.
Let me tell you that.

42:38.089 --> 42:40.225
We're gonna win enough games,
okay?

42:40.258 --> 42:42.761
Ogletree:
We did it ourselves. They didn't
do nothing to beat us.

42:42.794 --> 42:45.631
We got come back
to work next week.

42:45.664 --> 42:48.033
Every day. No days off, man.
-For sure.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.701
We still on a mission, man.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.103
This doesn't end our mission
where we want to go.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.239
-Yep.
-You feel me? Come on now.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.241
Keep your mind right now.
Don't get down on yourselves.

42:56.274 --> 42:57.676
Stay together.
Together on three.

42:57.709 --> 42:58.977
One, two, three.
-All: Together!

43:01.079 --> 43:03.014
Hamm: On the next episode
of "All Or Nothing"...

43:03.048 --> 43:05.016
Now we have to take
a whole team.

43:05.050 --> 43:06.985
We're all going to London now.
-Cheers.

43:07.018 --> 43:10.155
-Yes.
-Girls' trip.

43:10.188 --> 43:11.790
If you ain't different,
you the same.

43:11.823 --> 43:13.659
Your ass is replaceable.

43:13.692 --> 43:16.227
Announcer: The team speed of
the Rams dominating this game.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.864
-We playing fast, baby.
-Are you rooting for the Rams?

43:18.897 --> 43:20.932
-Of course. Of course.
-Okay. I like it.

43:20.966 --> 43:24.369
I'm doing everything possible
to get back on the field.

43:24.402 --> 43:26.237
We're ready to play
in the woods.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.806
We're ready to play in the hood.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.775
When it comes time
to nod off at night,

43:29.808 --> 43:32.243
just flip the old inflatable
mattress down on the floor.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.379
Hey, we got to wake up now.
Let's go.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.347
Jeff: So here's the question --
Do we want to go for it,

43:36.381 --> 43:37.983
or do we want
to take the points?

43:38.016 --> 43:40.218
Announcer: Here come the Rams,
out of the huddle

43:40.251 --> 43:41.687
and to the line.
