01:32.593 --> 01:34.010
When did you get up?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.889
I don't know.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.475
Is it still Saturday?

01:41.560 --> 01:44.729
I need you to fix
the outlet in the dining room.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.606
I thought you were going
to call an electrician.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.402
All you need to do is unscrew the fuse
and replace the plug, Don.

01:51.487 --> 01:54.280
Sounds like you could do it.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.242
I need to be able to plug in the hot plate.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.788
Okay.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.332
Bets, come here.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.965
Look, you've got a week before this party,

02:13.050 --> 02:15.635
and it doesn't haνe to be a big deal.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.553
Carla will help you.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.472
We're going to haνe a house full of people.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.350
I'd appreciate it if you'd take care
of the things on the list.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.311
Birdie, I'Il fix it.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.438
Thank you.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.278
Hello.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.989
Perfect timing. Ma just left.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.574
You two are on
your honeymoon, Mr. Seeger?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.992
Yes.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.328
And how did you meet
this loνely young lady?

02:42.412 --> 02:43.996
At a New Year's Eve party.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.999
I brought colored pencils for the boys.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.460
They're out back throwing rocks
at my laundry.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.004
How is he?

02:52.089 --> 02:53.422
I don't know.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.132
I told you about the chiropractor.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.009
They're not doctors.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.011
Did I tell you he cried?

02:59.096 --> 03:00.096
Anita--

03:00.180 --> 03:02.348
Sometimes l think about Mike Ryan.
Remember him?

03:02.432 --> 03:04.559
Stop it. Gerry has a job.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.018
He hates it.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.812
He told me he hated it,

03:07.896 --> 03:09.730
and then a week later his back started.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.650
His buddies from work
don't even come by anymore.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.986
They think he's a malingerer.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.990
And Ma, all she can talk
about are her bunions.

03:19.074 --> 03:22.118
I checked out the next
Horatio Hornblower for him.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.037
I was right. There is only
one book about Moby Dick.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.956
Him with the books.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.125
Who is it?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.543
I don't know.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.048
Oh, Lord.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.927
Hello, Father.
What a pleasant surprise.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.053
Well, I'm sorry for dropping in.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.055
I just thought that he could use a visit.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.056
Bless you.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.057
How is he?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.350
Much better, thanks.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.435
Good, good. I'm glad.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.730
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Father.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.898
Let me see if he's awake.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.441
No, please don't disturb him.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.693
Nonsense. He'll be thrilled.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.531
It means a lot that you're νisiting.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.700
You as well, I'm sure.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.327
Are you hungry?

04:04.411 --> 04:06.871
I've already been fed a few times today.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.497
It's a wonderful community, you know?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.374
It is.

04:12.461 --> 04:16.422
l see you at church,
but you don't seem very comfortable.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.175
No. That's not true.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.428
You don't participate.
You keep to yourself.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.643
You know, there are
many ways to be involved.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.104
There's a committee for the CYO dance.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.356
And for selfish reasons,

04:33.440 --> 04:36.150
l would love to take advantage
of your professional services again.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.860
What do you mean?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.111
Publicity.

04:39.196 --> 04:43.407
Last year's poster was girls in garlands
dancing around a maypole.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.618
I don't think that's what the kids want.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.120
No. They don't.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.623
I'm so busy right now, Father.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.500
Think of it as pro bono.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.960
Talk to your boss.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.504
I really would like the kids to show up.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.673
He's ready to see you, Father.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.716
I'll get you the specifics.

05:05.931 --> 05:09.642
As of today, you are costing this company
more than you are making it.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.143
Excuse me?

05:11.228 --> 05:13.145
Tim Dunst called from Maytag.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.148
ApparentIy, last night, their switchboard
lit up like a Christmas tree.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.317
- I didn't hear--
- You're head of the teleνision department,

05:18.402 --> 05:20.152
so I know you can't watch everything.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.862
But who exactly oνersaw the placement

05:21.947 --> 05:24.240
of Maytag in The ABC Sunday Night Movie?

05:26.493 --> 05:29.662
Well, I take full responsibility.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.914
There was a scene
with a murderous Russian spy

05:31.999 --> 05:34.166
who was referred to
as an agitator repeatedly,

05:34.251 --> 05:35.960
and this led into a Maytag spot,

05:36.044 --> 05:38.921
the title of which is "The Amazing Agitator."

05:40.507 --> 05:41.549
Really?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.342
Is this all a big joke to you?

05:43.427 --> 05:45.177
The Russians are still our enemy, you know.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.179
This will not happen again.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.181
Crane, we're eating this one.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.975
Politics aside, you need to be aware

05:51.059 --> 05:53.602
that a client will take
any excuse not to pay us.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.272
You need to get
your department in line, or l'll gut it.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.440
Yes, sir.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.275
I'll get to the bottom of this.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.203
Hey, Harry, what's the name
of that place we went to

06:11.288 --> 06:12.747
with the wallpaper and the kebabs?

06:12.831 --> 06:13.873
I don't remember.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.374
Can one of you help me read TV scripts?

06:15.459 --> 06:16.584
For money?

06:16.668 --> 06:17.918
I don't think so.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.920
There's too much to read,
and I have nobody.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.214
There are things to do
that I didn't know were my job.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.300
How could that be?
You made that job up.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.596
l thought I would be a liaison
between the networks and the agency

06:28.680 --> 06:30.097
and, l don't know, buy time.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.308
That's what your job was before.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.560
So now what? It's a whole 'nother job.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.103
That's why we haνe juniors.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.229
Someone to blame.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.231
You need someone to Iay down
on the barbed wire

06:39.316 --> 06:40.983
so you can run oνer them.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.243
Heineken was pleased but confused.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.037
By the fact that you don't use their product?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.247
That's why I brought Campbell.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.249
So what's the problem?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.001
They're set on competing at the tap.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.213
We just haνe to find a way
to excite your aνerage taνern inhabitant,

07:02.297 --> 07:03.380
and they'll be happy.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.008
Did you explain to them that there's a market

07:06.093 --> 07:08.344
that's actually excited
about Heineken being imported?

07:09.679 --> 07:12.348
For women entertaining in the home,
Holland is Paris.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.558
They can buy this sophisticated beer

07:14.643 --> 07:17.353
and proudly walk it into the kitchen
instead of hiding it in the garage.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.271
I'm just telling you I sensed resistance.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.606
If you want to get some research,

07:20.690 --> 07:22.316
I'll get them into a room with you again.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.318
Okay.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.153
We'll go up and down the Hudson,

07:26.238 --> 07:28.697
northern New Jersey,
Connecticut, the cash belt--

07:28.782 --> 07:31.033
set up a few end-aisle
displays at the A&Ps,

07:31.118 --> 07:32.535
away from the other beer,

07:32.619 --> 07:36.288
surrounded by cheese and crackers
and toothpicks with cellophane tips.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.623
We can try that.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.291
Maybe short, uneven stacks.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.543
Make it look popular.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.294
Plus, housewives love green.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.754
We'll go make some calls.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.091
You're still going to have to sit down
and sell this to them.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.303
By the way,
I hate to disappoint your wife,

07:51.388 --> 07:53.472
but I don't know about Sunday night.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.015
I'd worry more about disappointing Roger.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.310
He seemed to think it was important
that we sit down with Crab Colson.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.480
And believe me, l'm sure my wife
would rather go see a movie.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.649
Who's Crab Colson?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.651
Rogers & Cowan.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.028
I'll get the time from your girl again.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.602
Mr. Sterling is here to see you.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.147
Send him in, please.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.484
- Roger.
- Crane.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.906
Mitch says you want
to expand your department.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.783
Looks pretty big already.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.953
Well, the way other teleνision departments
haνe this set up--

09:39.037 --> 09:40.204
and I'νe checked on this--

09:40.288 --> 09:43.082
there should be a dedicated man
for Broadcast Operations.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.667
And what is he dedicated to?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.419
Reading scripts, meetings to discuss.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.464
I'm really the face of the television
department for the clients.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.632
Have you noticed we're full up?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.092
Who's going to pay this person, you?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.844
The money we save avoiding surprises
will make it worthwhile.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.429
You smoke, Crane?

09:57.514 --> 09:58.722
Sometimes.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.476
How do l know you're not just goldbricking?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.769
Because that's what Mitch thinks.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.690
I don't want to speak out of turn--

10:07.774 --> 10:09.984
Warren, do you mind?

10:12.654 --> 10:15.781
I don't think Mitch has been very happy
with my recent promotion.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.865
Are you?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.534
Yes, of course.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.870
Figure out a way to do the job yourself.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.627
You better not repeat any of that to Mitch.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.013
Peggy Olson's office.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.681
May l speak with Miss Olson?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.558
This is Father John Gill calling.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.188
Peggy Olson speaking.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.524
Hello, Peggy.
This is Father John Gill.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.900
Do you have a minute?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.819
Yes. Did you get the flyer?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.070
Yes.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.490
It's good, but can you take
whatever this is

10:58.575 --> 11:01.368
and make it into a poster?

11:01.453 --> 11:03.579
What do you mean, whatever this is?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.457
Well, there's been some discussion.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.709
Don't you like it?

11:08.793 --> 11:13.505
The CYO committee is curious
about "A Night to Remember."

11:14.591 --> 11:15.966
What's the problem?

11:16.051 --> 11:19.887
Well, they feel it sends
the wrong message to the girls.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.515
It's wholesome and romantic.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.933
And you have to get the girls.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.518
It's the only way the boys will come.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.020
Well--

11:28.104 --> 11:30.022
Tell them that this is the way it works,

11:30.106 --> 11:31.440
and I know better than them.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.527
Peggy, couldn't you just speak with them?

11:35.612 --> 11:39.031
They just want to feel involved.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.741
Of course.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.202
I'd love to hear their thoughts.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.536
Good-bye, Father.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.996
Good-bye.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.877
Unlike some deodorants,

11:51.961 --> 11:54.588
Fresh doesn't promise you
eternal romance.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.800
Mr. Crane, may I be of some assistance?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.843
I'm sorry.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.220
What?

12:01.304 --> 12:03.931
I received a memo
from Mr. Sterling's office,

12:04.015 --> 12:06.892
saying that you needed a girl
to help you with your workload.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.562
No, that's not exactly what I asked for.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.649
Well, I don't know what you had in mind,
but we are spread very thin.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.026
Hello, Joan.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.569
Hello, Warren.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.656
You...

12:20.740 --> 12:22.616
You look great today.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.743
Thank you, Warren.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.662
I need someone to run
our commercial scripts

12:26.746 --> 12:29.581
past the networks for approval.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.624
Can't you just use a messenger?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.669
No. That person also has to read
the network scripts for me

12:33.753 --> 12:35.838
and really make sure
our clients aren't misrepresented.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.966
I don't feel comfortable
sending my girls out of the building,

12:39.050 --> 12:40.926
but I will find someone to read the scripts.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.719
My wife is pregnant.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.180
I just want to get out of here
at a reasonable hour.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.224
How many are there?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.477
And what are they looking for?

12:50.562 --> 12:52.729
We just want to nip
any problems in the bud.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.607
For example, if a kid's pushing away
his dinner in disgust,

12:55.692 --> 12:58.110
just make sure it's not Gorton's fish sticks.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.612
You know, people can't be
coughing and dying

13:00.697 --> 13:01.738
right before a Lucky ad.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.323
Things like that.
It's common sense, really.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.616
It sounds interesting.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.619
It is. For the first few.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.621
And there's Maytag in there.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.290
They're very sensitive to Communism.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.338
Why can't I do that?

13:18.423 --> 13:19.965
Because you already haνe a job.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.634
No. I mean talk to her like that.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.678
She's so much woman.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.884
You are so graceful.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.677
She is adorable.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.387
They're doing Winnie the Pooh this year.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.932
She's going to be Piglet.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.475
It's all very professional-looking.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.686
Cheryl's 14. She won't eνen waltz
on my feet anymore.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.605
Ours is engaged.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.690
Enjoy it while you can.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.276
Crab, can I get you another one of those?

14:21.361 --> 14:24.154
Like the song says, I'd be a fool to say no.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.908
- Roger?
- Ladies first.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.993
All right, the evening show is over.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.704
Bedtime. Say good-bye to everybody.

14:32.789 --> 14:36.041
Good night.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.627
- Good night, slugger.
- Good night.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.712
Hello.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.714
Hello, Mrs. Draper.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.424
Betty.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.926
These are beautiful.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.428
I'm sorry l'm late. My date cancelled.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.097
You should have called.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.807
I might have been able to replace her.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.602
Carla, would you please
put these in water?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.272
And our head count is now seven.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.732
What a lovely home.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.609
Hello, Duck.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.528
I remember you, Sally.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.654
Hello.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.239
And who do we have here?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.323
This is Bobby.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.783
Bobby, shake Mr. Phillips' hand.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.744
Do you like baseball, Bobby?

15:14.330 --> 15:15.747
Come on. Let's go to bed.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.752
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't want to come stag.

15:20.837 --> 15:21.753
Nobody cares.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.798
l don't know.
My wife hated odd numbers.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.427
Well, hello, there.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.846
Duck Phillips, you know Mona.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.930
Of course.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.682
Hello.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.435
Of course this is Petra and Crab Colson.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.772
Crab, Duck. Duck, Crab.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.649
Can I get you something?

15:42.734 --> 15:43.942
Tomato juice, if you have it.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.485
Come on.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.362
I'll haνe something with dinner.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.114
Beautiful drive.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.574
- Did you take the Sawmill?
- l did.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.826
Found myself heading
to New Rochelle by accident.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.411
I used to live there.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.537
It's loνely there.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.122
I'll tell you the way to go.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.833
We're taking our sloop
from my folks' place in Old Lyme

15:59.959 --> 16:01.793
all the way down to Larchmont
for Race Week.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.961
We should get a boat.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.464
My father had a boat. Almost killed him.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.799
You might as well
cut a hole in your pocket.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.135
The slip and the dry dock
and the yacht club.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.887
Speaking of which, Don,

16:11.971 --> 16:14.348
are you and Bets joining
Willow Oaks or not?

16:14.432 --> 16:15.891
We're lonely.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.810
If you wish, you can
leaνe your drinks here

16:18.895 --> 16:20.395
and join us in the dining room.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.439
Terrific.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.732
So, Rogers & Cowan.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.651
It's a good place to be right now.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.823
He does everything
you need him to do, you know?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.825
Well, we took the road that goes to--

16:36.204 --> 16:37.913
How did that get there?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.543
We're going to take a little trip
around the world,

16:43.628 --> 16:45.921
starting in Spain with gazpacho,

16:46.005 --> 16:48.423
followed by Japan-- rumaki--

16:48.508 --> 16:50.384
and then we'll stop by Duchess County

16:50.468 --> 16:52.636
for a leg of lamb, mint jelly,

16:52.720 --> 16:53.845
accompanied by egg noodles,

16:53.930 --> 16:55.889
the way my grandmother
made them from Germany.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.892
And we have a choice
of burgundy from France

16:59.018 --> 17:01.937
or a frosted glass of beer from Holland.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.357
Did you bring a case from work?

17:05.441 --> 17:06.858
No.

17:06.943 --> 17:07.859
Oh, please, Draper.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.361
You'll do anything to win an argument.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.987
I don't understand.

17:11.072 --> 17:14.324
You went out and bought that?
At the store?

17:14.409 --> 17:15.909
Carla did some of the marketing,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.954
but no, I did. Why?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.957
I'm not even allowed to pick where I sit.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.753
What's so funny?

17:26.838 --> 17:28.630
Crab, if you want to be in business

17:28.715 --> 17:30.048
with someone who knows their stuff--

17:30.133 --> 17:31.883
Heineken is one of our clients.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.261
He said you were the market, and you are.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.890
- That is funny.
- Incredible.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.768
What an interesting experiment.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.730
I have to sit down.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.022
Please do.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.649
Now who wants wine?

17:48.985 --> 17:50.485
Please start.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.830
The soup is delicious.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.250
To our hosts.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.503
And their idyllic country home,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.422
and to new friends.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.007
Hear, hear.

18:20.016 --> 18:23.435
"A Night to Remember"
is eνery girl's dream.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.271
It holds the wholesome promise
of the kind of hand-holding

18:26.355 --> 18:28.023
that eventually leads to marriage.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.694
I think it's exactly what we talked about.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.988
I don't like the way they're dancing.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.115
They're too close together.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.452
Maybe leave some room
for the Holy Ghost.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.455
Uh, maybe they're doing a box step.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.708
Fine.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.253
You're not worried about
having a dance full of girls only?

18:50.338 --> 18:52.297
When the boys hear
that the girls are going--

18:52.381 --> 18:53.840
The boys aren't going to hear nothing.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.509
They don't go to school together.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.552
They go to church together.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.055
And this isn't the first CYO event.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.890
That's true.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.975
I'd never thought about that,
but you're right.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.978
I'm just saying I'm not an expert,

19:07.063 --> 19:08.897
but there might be another slogan.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.859
What do you want, two flyers?

19:12.944 --> 19:15.946
No. We don't have to
throw this one away,

19:16.030 --> 19:18.949
but maybe we can, um--

19:19.033 --> 19:23.078
I think she's saying
maybe we should try something else.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.670
Thank you very much.
I'll see what I can do.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.296
You're such a doll.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.843
Could I speak to you a minute?

19:37.927 --> 19:41.054
Father, I wanted to talk to you, too.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.974
We can speak tomorrow.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.936
Thank you all for your
generosity and your time.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.032
Father, I don't mind working,

20:01.117 --> 20:03.827
but this is completely unnecessary.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.037
Well, I don't understand.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.039
Did you agree with them?

20:08.124 --> 20:10.041
The dancers could be farther apart,

20:10.126 --> 20:12.043
but you were very persuasive.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.879
You don't have to agree with them.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.630
In fact, you're not supposed to.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.967
You asked me to do this
based on my expertise.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.428
Well, I'm not really on the committee.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.971
I'm more of a liaison.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.307
You're supposed to tell them
that they should trust me.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.058
That's your job.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.643
They'll listen to you.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.062
You're right.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.231
I'm sorry this is so much work.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.817
No, l can turn it around.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.068
And the copy machine?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.070
Yes, I cleared it.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.196
I'm sorry, Father.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.115
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.034
I'm νery tired.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.994
We'll both be prepared next time.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.162
Come on.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.918
Good night, Peggy.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.377
I really am glad you're here.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.962
Me, too.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.100
You didn't set the table?

21:09.185 --> 21:12.812
I'm sorry. You came back so fast.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.439
I'll get plates.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.736
You're not going to believe what happens
on As the World Turns.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.112
You're right about that.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.031
Let me ask you something.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.533
Is it possible for someone
to come out of a coma

21:25.618 --> 21:28.119
and have no recollection of who they are?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.622
Honestly, people don't
come out of comas much.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.748
Really?

21:31.832 --> 21:33.416
So it's also probably ridiculous

21:33.501 --> 21:35.710
they would have an accent
they didn't have beforehand?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.087
Yes.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.672
Well, it must have happened to somebody.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.465
I mean, they wouldn't
make it up completely, right?

21:40.549 --> 21:43.176
Probably once. Makes a good story.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.679
I'm going to get my drink.
Do you want something?

21:45.763 --> 21:46.846
Water.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.395
I didn't know you were such a reader.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.146
It's part of my job.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.149
I thought you just walked around
with people staring at you.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.318
You.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.865
What are you bothering with that for?

22:05.950 --> 22:08.159
You should be looking for a house.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.162
What happened to your fascination
with Glen Cove?

22:11.247 --> 22:13.039
You told me to stop looking.

22:13.124 --> 22:17.043
Well, I just need to finish my training.

22:17.128 --> 22:20.255
Joanie, you should be watching
those shows, not reading them,

22:20.339 --> 22:24.175
with a box of bonbons on your lap
to soothe your cravings.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.635
It's a hoot.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.512
I guess that's okay.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.098
I'm glad you approνe.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.061
Were you going to get me
a glass of water, hon?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.272
Of course.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.996
Hey, Chuck, you're gonna have to
wear a tag on your shirt.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.205
I won't know you--

22:54.290 --> 22:55.707
Carla, why don't you go home?

22:55.791 --> 22:58.001
We can do all this in the morning.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.335
That jam will set.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.130
Let me at least put the dishes in the basin.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.631
That's a good idea.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.678
If you want, you can go to bed.

23:08.763 --> 23:11.222
I'll show myself out,
call Louis to pick me up.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.767
It's okay. We had a long day.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.727
Thank you for all your help.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.900
Good night, Mr. Draper.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.152
Good night, Carla.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.321
It was a great success.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.414
MolIy Horton is a paying customer
on this one.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.458
I'm with you, Major.
Running a wagon train is a--

23:38.542 --> 23:39.959
Hey.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.755
You embarrassed me.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.341
What are you talking about?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.343
You embarrassed me.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.137
What did I do?

23:51.222 --> 23:53.848
You knew I would buy that beer.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.767
So what?

23:55.851 --> 23:58.019
Because you know me so well.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.813
You know everything about me.

23:59.897 --> 24:03.399
Bets, I use our life all the time in my work.

24:03.484 --> 24:04.818
They pay me for that.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.569
And then you laughed.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.197
You all laughed.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.866
Must be so funny being in on it.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.910
Come on.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.288
You're taking this the wrong way.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.582
You embarrassed me.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.043
I'm sorry.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.419
I didn't mean it.

24:23.504 --> 24:24.963
You never mean it.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.423
You just do whatever you want,

24:27.508 --> 24:29.342
and I put up with it because nobody knows.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.177
No one is going to remember that.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.720
You know what they're
going to remember?

24:32.805 --> 24:35.348
Petra Colson missing her chair.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.643
Come on. Leave this. You're tired.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.687
Let's go upstairs.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.605
I'm not going to bed.

24:42.690 --> 24:46.526
Not until you tell me
why you insist on humiliating me.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.820
Betty, I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.030
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.410
I know about you and that woman.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.453
What?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.956
Damn it, Don, I know you're haνing an affair.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.712
You and Bobbie Barrett.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.130
What?

25:07.214 --> 25:10.717
How could you? She's so old.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.219
Betty, that's ridiculous.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.264
I'm just telling you I know.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.979
Fine, Bets.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.106
What do you know?

25:26.650 --> 25:30.111
Go ahead. Tell me.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.863
Jimmy told me everything.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.158
Jimmy. He hates me.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.659
He told me everything.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.369
Please. What the hell did he say?

25:38.454 --> 25:41.372
So you can pick it apart?
Twist all my words?

25:41.457 --> 25:44.042
I'm not going to dignify
Jimmy Barrett with a response.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.960
He's a big mouth.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.879
And don't pretend I don't
know how he looks at you.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.091
I saw you two together.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.385
You think you know me?

25:54.470 --> 25:56.721
Well, I know what kind of a man you are.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.390
You think I would sleep with that woman?

25:59.475 --> 26:01.184
You can't help yourself.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.479
Admit it.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.648
There's nothing to admit.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.483
You're lying.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.611
I'm going to bed.

27:17.928 --> 27:18.970
Good morning.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.388
Good morning, Daddy.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.934
Mommy said the party was fun.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.270
Did she?

27:32.484 --> 27:33.985
Okay.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.237
Bye-bye.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.822
Bye, Daddy.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.165
Aren't you going to be a daddy soon?

27:47.249 --> 27:49.500
I've done my part. The rest is up to her.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.252
Don't pay attention to that due date.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.253
It'll driνe you nuts.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.255
- D Day.
- Hello.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.383
This is Mr. Pastern
and Mr. Kostis from Maytag.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.302
- Are we all better now?
- Yes.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.554
Process seems to be streamlined.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.516
Wait a minute. Is she the one
we spoke to on the phone?

28:05.601 --> 28:08.519
Yes. Joan is handling
Broadcast Operations.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.772
I had no idea.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.107
I would have combed my hair
before I called you.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.234
I've got next week's scripts.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.611
Don't hold anything back now.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.904
She won't.

28:17.988 --> 28:21.199
Well, it was nice to meet
both of you in person.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.367
Indeed.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.120
Hell of an operation you'νe got here, Crane.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.747
I think so.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.000
Gentlemen.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.210
Phil. Good to see you, as always.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.046
Francis. Can we get you something?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.424
We'νe got a fridge
full of Heineken out there.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.051
No. lt's 1 1 a.m., for Pete's sake.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.636
Well, thanks for coming by.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.096
We were just so excited,

30:07.181 --> 30:09.348
I thought you should hear it
from the horse's mouth.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.725
What exactly happened?

30:12.436 --> 30:13.686
Well...

30:15.105 --> 30:17.732
We explained to you before
that research shows

30:17.816 --> 30:19.275
that with the rise in commuters

30:19.359 --> 30:21.652
and the relative scarcity
of suburban bars,

30:21.737 --> 30:23.821
people are drinking more in the home.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.198
Yes, we heard you.

30:25.282 --> 30:28.367
Entertaining housewives, et cetera.

30:28.452 --> 30:29.702
We're not against it.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.539
We just think our money would
be spent better elsewhere.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.666
And honestly, l agree with you,

30:35.751 --> 30:38.628
but, well, we ran a little test,

30:38.712 --> 30:41.672
and the results were very enlightening.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.007
Don?

30:43.091 --> 30:45.885
We targeted
a few wealthy suburban markets

30:45.969 --> 30:48.888
with woman-friendly end-aisle displays.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.556
Was there a spike?

30:50.641 --> 30:52.683
The sample was very small,

30:52.768 --> 30:54.685
but what we put out sold weIl.

30:54.770 --> 30:58.064
More important was who it sold to.

30:58.148 --> 31:02.360
This is an untapped market
where you dictate the competition.

31:02.444 --> 31:06.155
I think l can say this
because Don's being modest.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.699
Don's wife, she's a peach of a girl.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.368
They had a dinner party.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.702
We're talking days after placement,

31:11.787 --> 31:14.956
and she had this elaborate, elegant setup--

31:15.040 --> 31:16.499
foods from around the globe.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.709
And sure enough,
there was your Heineken,

31:18.794 --> 31:21.212
right next to the bone china
and the polished sterling.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.713
It was incredible.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.216
Not exactly scientific.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.344
Although it sounds like
you do know your wife.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.179
She's exactly who we're after--

31:30.264 --> 31:33.516
well-off, educated,
with plenty of time to shop.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.268
And it's important for her

31:35.352 --> 31:38.729
that she's the perfect hostess,
the perfect wife.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.107
We even talked about
using her menu verbatim

31:41.191 --> 31:42.650
in selected ladies' magazines.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.901
Really?

31:43.986 --> 31:45.903
We haven't been there yet.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.739
No, but it's what I've been pushing for.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.075
And so I take your word on this?

31:51.159 --> 31:52.577
Why would l lie?

31:52.661 --> 31:54.662
We're the ones who are
going to haνe to deliνer.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.751
I guess we could throw it in the mix.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.753
Let's start regional.

32:02.838 --> 32:05.840
See how some strangers' wives feel.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.429
I would recommend
buying air time during Love ofLife.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.556
Women watching TV during the day

32:13.640 --> 32:15.766
like to fantasize
about haνing active lifestyles.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.519
They like where they could
be going with Sea & Ski.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.021
And they watch eνery day.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.523
I know my daughter missed
a lot of classes in college

32:22.608 --> 32:23.774
for her stories.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.735
My wife brought the TV home.

32:25.819 --> 32:26.777
There you go.

32:26.862 --> 32:30.114
Mr. Hansen, I don't know
how Mr. Crane feels about this,

32:30.198 --> 32:32.408
but I'νe been reading the scripts,

32:32.492 --> 32:33.868
and I just have to say

32:33.952 --> 32:36.287
As the World Turns
is about to become unmissable.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.788
I don't want to give it away,

32:37.873 --> 32:41.876
but someone people think is dead is not.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.546
I'm glad you like it, but they all do
the same things, don't they?

32:45.631 --> 32:46.756
No. Not at all.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.383
This is what they call
a special summer storyline,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.594
and l've spoken
to Logan Reynolds over at CBS,

32:51.678 --> 32:53.804
and it's going to receive a lot of promotion.

32:53.889 --> 32:54.889
Is it the same price?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.599
Well, they're all close.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.059
This sounds better.

32:58.143 --> 33:02.021
Well, if you lock them in at this rating
and then they exceed it,

33:02.105 --> 33:03.814
there's a bang
for your buck factor, isn't there?

33:03.899 --> 33:05.232
I would say so.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.901
Then you should do that.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.322
I think you'll be pleased.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.824
That's why I didn't want
to do this on the phone.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.495
I love what she says,
and I love the way she says it.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.538
Let me walk you out.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.053
Are you okay, Mommy?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.059
I'm okay, sweetheart.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.853
I'm just not feeling very well.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.272
Do you want some aspirin?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.525
No, Sally.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.152
I'm just going to rest a little bit, okay?

33:50.237 --> 33:53.197
Go play with your brother.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.907
Okay.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.089
Shit.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.446
Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.

34:34.448 --> 34:35.865
You said 4:30.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.825
Hell, is it only 4:30?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.368
Sorry about that.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.828
Listen, I'll be brief,

34:40.912 --> 34:42.913
since it appears I'm on my way out.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.082
I'νe received a lot
of unsolicited phone calls.

34:45.167 --> 34:46.917
Simply put, the customers are satisfied,

34:47.002 --> 34:48.252
and so is the accounting department.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.462
Keep up the good work.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.172
Well, I'm not doing it on my own.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.549
Right. That's true, isn't it?

34:53.633 --> 34:56.177
Why don't we get those secretaries
back to their regular jobs?

34:56.261 --> 34:57.928
It's just Joan Holloway, actually.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.556
So her attentions are divided at best.

35:00.640 --> 35:04.560
Make it a full-time position, 1 50 a week,
and he has to share an office.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.895
Sounds perfect.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.373
Hello.

35:40.847 --> 35:41.972
Where are the kids?

35:42.057 --> 35:44.475
Bed.

35:46.061 --> 35:49.647
What happened here?

35:49.731 --> 35:51.982
Nothing.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.984
Nothing happened here.

35:54.069 --> 35:58.239
I went through every pocket
and eνery drawer,

35:58.323 --> 35:59.573
and there's nothing.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.492
Would you stop?

36:01.576 --> 36:03.077
How much have you had to drink?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.287
I don't even know why I bother looking.

36:05.372 --> 36:11.460
All I found were stacks of cocktail napkins
with stupid advertising on them.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.212
What are you doing, Bets?

36:16.591 --> 36:19.176
I would never do this to you.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.764
How could you do this to me?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.518
I didn't do anything.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.260
Don.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.017
What time is it?

37:11.229 --> 37:14.732
I don't want it to be like this.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.239
Me, either.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.493
I don't know what to do.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.165
Don't.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.839
Nothing happened.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.426
Now you look me in the eye.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.887
You never do that.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.057
Yes, I do.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.185
You never say you love me.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.106
Yes, I do.

37:56.191 --> 37:59.109
You know I do.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.195
I say it all the time.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.197
No, you don't.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.121
Do you hate me?

38:11.206 --> 38:13.707
God, no.

38:16.670 --> 38:17.836
I loνe you, Bets.

38:17.921 --> 38:21.006
I do.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.716
And l love the children.

38:26.096 --> 38:28.222
I don't want to lose all this.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.579
This is a very impressive operation.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.456
It's Madison Avenue.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.960
Look at this.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.087
Did we get Miracle Whip?

39:01.131 --> 39:02.089
I don't know.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.507
Makes a lot of sense.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.259
She's an undercover nun.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.470
So, Turk doesn't know which way to turn,

39:08.555 --> 39:10.889
he's so drunk, so finally he stops.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.182
We get out of the car,

39:12.267 --> 39:15.269
and the sign says "Bridge Out."

39:16.855 --> 39:18.939
- Hello, Joan.
- You wanted to see me?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.524
Joan, this is Danny Lindstrom.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.900
Dan.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.946
He's going to be in charge
of Broadcast Operations.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.948
Excuse me?

39:28.033 --> 39:29.616
I've really appreciated you filling in.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.160
I couldn't have asked for more.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.453
Joan knows eνerything about this.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.621
Well, that makes one of us.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.875
I've already given him next week's scripts.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.502
It would be great if you
could fill him in on how it works.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.337
Right now?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.048
Why not? Are you busy?

39:45.300 --> 39:48.427
No. Not at all.

39:50.180 --> 39:54.308
It's really just reading
the scripts, all of them,

39:54.392 --> 39:56.226
and looking through the storylines

39:56.311 --> 39:59.980
to see if there's any...

40:00.065 --> 40:03.233
possible benefits to our clients,

40:03.318 --> 40:06.153
how their products
may be portrayed to their adνantage,

40:06.237 --> 40:09.531
and, of course,
getting the cooperation of the networks.

40:09.616 --> 40:11.325
That's pretty much what I said.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.494
Not exactly.

40:13.578 --> 40:17.331
Listen, you're going to be around
to help with the details, right?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.251
Yes, of course.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.252
Anything else?

40:22.337 --> 40:24.421
No, Joan. And thank you again.

40:34.849 --> 40:38.268
This is wonderful.
It's completely automatic.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.603
I just leave it.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.480
If you set the number.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.568
You know, don't think we don't know

40:46.653 --> 40:49.071
how lucky we are haνing
you do this for us.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.865
Thank you. lt's nice to be included.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.584
Peggy, do you have something
you need to talk about?

41:02.669 --> 41:04.586
Excuse me?

41:04.671 --> 41:06.922
Well, I've noticed that you
don't take Communion.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.924
And I don't think it's too much of a leap

41:09.008 --> 41:12.761
to ask if there's something
you need to talk about.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.264
No.

41:15.348 --> 41:18.350
God already knows whatever it is, Peggy.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.311
Well, then l don't need to talk.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.398
Well, I'm here right now.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.320
Father, don't take this the wrong way,

41:30.405 --> 41:34.241
but I don't think you'd understand.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.829
God is bigger than what we were raised on.

41:40.665 --> 41:45.294
Father, you don't have to liνe life
like the rest of us.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.336
Maybe you're lucky.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.297
I've lived life.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.048
I wasn't born a priest.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.425
Of course not.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.180
You know, when you distance
yourself from the church,

41:56.264 --> 41:59.850
you are distancing
yourself from everything.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.352
That's why it's called Communion,
you know.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.104
It's not just being with God.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.023
It's being with people.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.358
I know that.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.196
Well, then, why are you
pushing eνeryone away?

42:12.280 --> 42:14.990
I'm not.

42:15.074 --> 42:19.620
There is no sin too great to bring to God.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.708
You can reconcile yourself with him
and have a whole new start.

42:26.002 --> 42:28.754
You're a smart, beautiful young girl.

42:28.838 --> 42:30.923
You have so much to offer.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.721
Do you feel you don't deserve his loνe?

42:48.608 --> 42:50.317
Your copies are done.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.905
I'll put them in a box for you.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.293
There you go.

43:08.378 --> 43:10.420
Thank you very much, Peggy.

43:10.505 --> 43:11.713
I'll see you on Sunday?

43:11.798 --> 43:13.590
Yes, of course.

43:23.518 --> 43:24.977
Welcome to the club.

43:28.982 --> 43:32.317
So I pulled Sylνia's hair
and treated her mean.

43:32.402 --> 43:33.902
She ran after me all the time,

43:33.987 --> 43:36.446
and every day she took me
down to the malt shop

43:36.531 --> 43:37.990
to split a soda with her.

43:38.074 --> 43:41.493
And just like that, l lose her.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.245
How do you know you lost her?

43:43.329 --> 43:45.122
Today I walked into the malt shop,

43:45.206 --> 43:47.749
and there was another guy
at the end of my straw.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.465
Imagine my horror when
a night on the town turned ugly.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.467
This is a nice place for nice people.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.470
And the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.555
What am I, a squirrel?

44:03.516 --> 44:04.516
Lucky for him,

44:04.642 --> 44:06.935
I carry my own whereνer I go.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.813
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.774
Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.

44:14.569 --> 44:15.736
Take it from a nut.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.571
Utz are better than nuts.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.413
We have chains in almost
every suburban market

44:26.497 --> 44:29.249
on the East Coast,
plus Chicago, Cleveland.

44:29.334 --> 44:30.917
It's a vote of confidence.

44:32.128 --> 44:33.587
Mrs. Draper is on the line.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.214
I got to take this.

44:36.299 --> 44:37.716
Thank her again for me.

44:44.724 --> 44:46.266
Hello.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.518
Don't come home.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.145
What?

44:50.229 --> 44:51.521
I don't care what you do.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.607
I just don't want you here.

44:55.777 --> 44:59.571
- Betty.
- Don, l don't want to see you.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.086
Well, early in the morning

46:38.171 --> 46:40.547
About the break of day

46:40.631 --> 46:42.632
I asked the Lord

46:42.717 --> 46:47.220
Help me find the way

46:47.305 --> 46:49.514
To the Promised Land

46:49.599 --> 46:53.685
This lonely body needs a helping hand

46:53.811 --> 46:58.523
I asked the Lord to help me, please

46:58.608 --> 47:02.819
Find the way

47:02.904 --> 47:04.779
When a new day's a-dawning

47:04.864 --> 47:06.948
I bow my head in prayer

47:07.033 --> 47:08.742
I pray to the Lord

47:08.826 --> 47:11.411
Won't you lead me there?

47:11.496 --> 47:15.707
Won't you guide me safely
to the golden stair?

47:15.833 --> 47:20.170
Won't you let this body Your burden share?

47:20.254 --> 47:22.422
I pray to the Lord

47:22.507 --> 47:24.674
Won't you lead me, please?

47:24.759 --> 47:28.762
Lead me there.

47:40.066 --> 47:43.068
