02:26.360 --> 02:29.279
In the Steven Spielberg movie "E.T.",

02:29.960 --> 02:32.119
why's the alien brown?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.319
No reason.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.079
In "Love Story",

02:38.240 --> 02:41.919
why did the two characters
fall madly in love with each other?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.119
No reason.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.319
In Oliver Stone's "JFK",

02:47.480 --> 02:51.479
Why's the President suddenly
assassinated by some stranger?

02:52.560 --> 02:53.879
No reason.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.839
In the excellent "Chainsaw Massacre"
by Tobe Hooper,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.679
why don't we ever see the characters
go to the bathroom...

03:00.840 --> 03:04.239
or wash their hands,
like people doing in real life?

03:04.920 --> 03:06.199
Absolutely no reason.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.799
Worse, in "The Pianist" by Polanski,

03:10.440 --> 03:13.959
how come this guy has to hide
and live like a bomb...

03:14.120 --> 03:16.759
when he plays the piano so well?

03:16.920 --> 03:19.039
Once again the answer is "no reason".

03:19.200 --> 03:21.439
I could go on for hours
with more examples.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.039
The list is endless.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.559
You probably never gave it a thought.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.879
But all great films,

03:28.040 --> 03:29.759
without exception,

03:29.920 --> 03:33.279
contain an important element--
a "no reason".

03:33.440 --> 03:34.959
And you know why?

03:35.520 --> 03:37.399
Because life itself...

03:37.560 --> 03:40.479
is filled with "no reason".

03:41.120 --> 03:43.399
Why can't we see the air all around us?

03:43.560 --> 03:44.839
No reason.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.719
Why're we always thinking?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.119
No reason.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.279
Why do some people love sausages
and other people hate sausages?

03:53.580 --> 03:55.680
No fuckin' reason.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.399
Come on, don't waste your time
explaining that garbage. Let's go!

03:59.560 --> 04:01.399
Just one minute. Let me finish.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.759
Ladies, gentlemen,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.799
the film you're about to see today

04:08.960 --> 04:12.199
is an homage to the "no reason"--

04:13.080 --> 04:16.478
that most powerful element...of style.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.439
Why did they destroy all those chairs.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.479
- Too sad on those.
- Yeah, it's really a pity.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.159
Quiet, please.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.439
Everybody turn around.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.199
Good. Enjoy.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.759
Excuse me, is it going to be in color
or black and white?

05:42.320 --> 05:43.759
It's already boring.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.159
Don't be so negative.
It's just the beginning.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.479
It's going to pick up. Just be patient.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.879
I hope that's not an old silent film.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.599
I can't hear thing.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.199
Yes, you can hear the wind a little.
If You listen.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.239
Somebody see something?

06:05.560 --> 06:08.999
I see a dump, there, straight ahead.

07:48.200 --> 07:54.850
RUBBER

13:54.600 --> 13:57.119
Amazing. He just blew up a bottle
without even touching it.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.879
Really? Let me see.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.599
That's odd.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.399
It looks like he has telepathic power.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.999
You mean Psychokinetic?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.359
I don't care about the right word.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.359
Has it just blown up
the bottle with its mind?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.039
It is most likely. Yes.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.319
That's awesome. I'm starting to like it.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.879
I think the kid is right.
Psychokinetic powers.

14:19.040 --> 14:22.079
Excuse me, but do you have to
comment everything aloud?

14:22.240 --> 14:25.999
We are not commenting,
we are only trying to understand.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.359
- What do you think of it?
- Nothing.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.559
You know you're not allowed to film
the film. That is forbidden by law.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.559
It is?

14:36.720 --> 14:38.559
Yeah, they'll put you in jail for that.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.239
Jail?

14:40.520 --> 14:41.559
That's kidding me?

14:41.720 --> 14:45.519
Yes, she's right, it is piracy.
I'll be careful if I were you.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.879
My wife could not come.
I just wanna show her.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.439
This's piracy anyway.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.799
Thanks for that. I won't in the future.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.359
Come on!

18:27.520 --> 18:28.959
Starting again!

18:29.680 --> 18:30.919
Wake up!

18:31.920 --> 18:33.159
Let's go!

18:36.240 --> 18:39.439
Jesus, I almost slept awake.
Fuckin' insects!

18:39.600 --> 18:41.999
I was really cold myself.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.199
Quiet!

18:43.920 --> 18:45.079
Wake up!

18:45.240 --> 18:49.359
Excuse me. Would it be possible
to have some coffee and toast?

18:59.280 --> 19:00.919
Dad, I'm hungry.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.399
Dad?

19:13.960 --> 19:15.319
Where is he?

19:15.480 --> 19:16.839
Straight ahead.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.119
He just woke up.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.319
Oh, thanks.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.679
Anyone got any food?

24:54.920 --> 24:55.759
Oh my god!

26:33.360 --> 26:34.519
Not bad at all.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.999
Well, let me see.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.639
It is the first time in my life
I identify with a tire.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.799
Stop that. Give me that!

26:42.120 --> 26:43.959
Her ass is not that great,
but I understand.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.479
You're hard to pleased.
It is fine with me.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.959
Her ass isn't that great

26:49.120 --> 26:52.379
but she has quite a wag on it.
You think the tire is gonna get laid?

26:52.540 --> 26:54.559
I would like to see it!
What position do you think?

26:54.720 --> 26:56.999
I think she'll start with
a good blowjob.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Oh yeah...

26:58.280 --> 27:00.299
Jesus, you think you're
gonna shut up some time

27:00.300 --> 27:02.319
and let's watch in
peace? I can't stand it.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.879
Come on. Can't you take a little joke?

27:04.040 --> 27:07.859
Yes, there is plenty of space. Go
somewhere else if we're bothering you.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.359
You should be the ones to move if you
have to laugh so loud, don't you think?

27:10.520 --> 27:13.759
No. Why don't you just do like that
cripple, and plug on your walkman

27:13.920 --> 27:15.159
and listen to your music and
then no one bother you any more.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.759
It's not a walkman
It's a medical gismo.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.719
Come on, let's just forget it.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.879
Brats.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.119
Bye, brats.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.999
Mom, it's me. I'm gonna spend the night
in a motel. I don't wanna try anymore.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.799
See you tomorrow. I love you. Bye.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.479
Anything interesting?

28:32.640 --> 28:34.479
He just switched the channel.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.959
Okay. Well...
wake us if we miss anything major.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.719
Good night, everybody.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.679
How long before humans start to
eat each other out of hunger?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.359
Don't talk crap. Just sleep.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.159
Are you rustlers?

28:47.320 --> 28:48.999
You're gonna let us starve
without doing a thing?

28:49.200 --> 28:50.639
I found the blown-off rabbit.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.359
You are really so cruel!

28:52.600 --> 28:55.119
- I think it's okay to eat, right?
- Idiot!

28:55.280 --> 28:56.799
Can't you see it's fake?

29:55.320 --> 29:56.839
Yes, master.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.359
Very well, master.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.319
Certainly.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.999
I understand perfectly.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.879
I am gonna do it
tomorrow morning without fail.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.719
Yeah. First thing in the morning.
You can count on me.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.839
Salutations, master.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.479
Morning.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.319
- Can I clean your room?
- Yeah.

31:12.720 --> 31:13.999
Why not?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.759
Food!

32:03.520 --> 32:04.599
Food!

32:25.840 --> 32:27.199
Animals.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.519
Anybody there?

33:10.600 --> 33:13.079
Excuse me,
you want me to come back later?

33:28.520 --> 33:30.039
Fucking weirdoes!

34:14.560 --> 34:16.399
I just saw a live tire.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.799
You get nothing better to do than
come here to start talking rubbish?

34:20.400 --> 34:22.679
I swear... it's true.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.199
Look. He locked himself in room 16.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.518
Did you get homework to do or something?

34:29.159 --> 34:30.239
I am on holidays.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.279
And you don't know what
to do with yourself.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.958
Well you're bugging me.

34:34.679 --> 34:35.719
You don't believe me.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.279
You shut up!

34:38.000 --> 34:39.759
Look, here.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.958
Get on your bike,
and go get me a pizza, alright?

34:43.120 --> 34:45.159
I give you ten minutes to kill.

34:46.199 --> 34:49.079
You go have a look
in room 16 now. Please!

34:49.239 --> 34:52.039
Would you get on your bike
and get  me a pizza?

34:52.199 --> 34:53.839
Cut this bullshit out?

34:54.600 --> 34:55.679
Do it!

34:57.800 --> 35:00.119
And don't forget the double toppings!

37:14.920 --> 37:17.319
Here's your double topping, dickhead.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.079
And the tire's supposed to float?

38:07.240 --> 38:09.959
An inner tube, yes. Not a tire.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.039
Really? I'd rather bet
just the opposite.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.799
Feeling any better, son?

38:21.520 --> 38:23.279
It's burning hard.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.359
Daddy, I beg you call a doctor.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.759
Come on. Probably just ate too fast.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.919
It's gonna be alright. Don't worry.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.839
We all ate too fast.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.639
It's hurting bad, I told you!

38:36.800 --> 38:38.919
Does anybody know anything
about medicine?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.719
No, sorry.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.619
Well, do you happen to
know anything about physics?

38:42.620 --> 38:45.359
Would a tire sink or float?

38:45.420 --> 38:47.759
It would sink.
We just saw it a minute ago.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.759
What is going on?

38:59.400 --> 39:00.999
Oh, damnit! It's a hell.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.079
Oh, help me!

39:02.240 --> 39:03.439
What's happening to us?

39:03.600 --> 39:04.959
We're poisoned.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.639
The turkey was a trap.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.079
A trap?

39:09.120 --> 39:12.559
Oh! Is this how they
they treat the audience?

39:12.720 --> 39:15.599
Don't worry ma'am.
They're not gonna get away with this.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.439
I am still here.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.119
And I want my show.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.399
Sure I want my show.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.719
Anybody there?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.159
Tire?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.199
...the pool there.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.319
It is right here.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.919
This tire is alive.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.839
The tire story again?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.679
It doesn't look very alive to me.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.959
I saw the tire get into room 16.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.439
He locked himself in.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.039
You know what, I've heard
enough rubbish for the day.

41:12.200 --> 41:16.199
Now get the dirty tire out of the pool,
or I'm gonna get really mad!

41:18.160 --> 41:20.239
- Sorry, lieutenant.
- Nothing.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.159
But tell me...

41:23.800 --> 41:27.519
Don't you find it strange
we can't see the air around us?

41:29.200 --> 41:30.879
Why do you say that?

41:32.080 --> 41:33.399
Just like that.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.879
No reason.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.959
Okay, kid, listen to me.

41:45.120 --> 41:48.399
Nothing to worry about.
It's a perfectly ordinary tire.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.639
Yeah, same here.
You see it's not moving.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.199
- Well, maybe it drowned.
- Would you stop with this crap, okay?

41:54.360 --> 41:55.879
You're putting me ashamed in front of

41:56.040 --> 41:57.139
- a police officer.
- Don't be rough.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.339
- There is no need to do that.
- You know, someone died here, okay?

41:59.400 --> 42:01.399
We don't joke about things like that.
Do you understand?

42:01.400 --> 42:02.299
Yeah, that is true.

42:02.360 --> 42:06.019
I'm not joking. I am sure
that this tire killed Martina.

42:06.019 --> 42:07.739
Oh, that is enough! Alright?

42:07.800 --> 42:11.079
I don't want to see you anymore. Okay?
We will settle this tonight. Now squirm!

42:11.240 --> 42:13.119
You're getting on my nerves, go!

42:15.920 --> 42:16.919
You're a little jumpy.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.159
Not usually.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.479
And take your fucking tire, would you?!

42:26.520 --> 42:27.679
Sorry.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.239
Mr. Hugues, can I ask you some
questions for the investigation?

42:31.400 --> 42:32.279
Sure, go ahead.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.879
How was your relationship with Martina?

42:35.480 --> 42:38.799
We got along fine, you know,
employer, employee.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.239
- You were satisfied with her work?
- Yeah.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.759
Nothing in particular you'd mention
about her behaviour?

42:44.760 --> 42:45.760
No.

42:48.840 --> 42:49.799
Very good.

42:49.960 --> 42:53.959
It's been 6 hours, the poison has
had time to take effect. We can stop.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.479
- The poison?
- Yes, we poisoned the spectators.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.399
And go home now, Mr. Huges.
We don't need you anymore.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.759
- Thank you very much.
- I don't understand.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.079
It was a pleasure working with you.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.919
Everybody, listen!

43:37.160 --> 43:38.479
I have something important to announce.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.719
Pay attention, please.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.599
You can all relax.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.639
It's over. We're stopping now.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.519
Thanks, and...

43:57.320 --> 43:59.039
congratulations to all.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.689
Great job.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.799
What did you mean, Chad?

44:04.120 --> 44:06.439
I meant exactly what I just said.
It's over.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.279
You can go home with your families now.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.599
It's been a pleasure working with you.

44:11.110 --> 44:12.329
You're out of your mind?

44:12.820 --> 44:14.159
Why do you want us to go home?

44:16.100 --> 44:19.799
Come on.
Stop acting like this is real life.

44:19.960 --> 44:23.919
I'm telling you we're done.
There's no one watching anymore, okay?

44:24.680 --> 44:26.279
No use going on.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.679
Stop.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.799
Finish. We're packing in.

44:31.960 --> 44:36.799
But... this is real life, Chad.
We have a dead body over here.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.279
No.

44:39.190 --> 44:41.719
Come on. It's not real life.

44:41.880 --> 44:44.759
Look at you, you have a stuffed
toy alligator under your arm.

44:50.920 --> 44:51.999
So?

44:56.280 --> 44:59.939
Okay. I'm gonna show you something.
Denise, take your gun.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.359
- Why?
- Take it, I tell you!

45:04.520 --> 45:05.879
It's an order!

45:11.280 --> 45:14.319
- Now point it to me and shoot.
- No way!

45:14.440 --> 45:16.479
Doug, you do it.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.279
Don't think. Just shoot.

45:30.800 --> 45:31.759
Oh God!

45:33.800 --> 45:34.679
You see?

45:36.080 --> 45:37.639
I don't feel a thing.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.559
No pain whatsoever.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.999
It's not real.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.879
You understand?

45:46.320 --> 45:48.239
Everything is fake.

45:50.000 --> 45:50.959
Shoot again.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.119
Now you believe me?

46:00.640 --> 46:04.319
This situation is not real.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.079
Go home.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.119
It's all over.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.359
Thanks.

46:13.160 --> 46:16.679
What about the cleaning lady?
She's really dead?

46:17.200 --> 46:19.519
Open the bag. You might be surprised.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.639
It is a regular corpse.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.759
Give her a good slap, you'll see.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.999
Stop your bullshit. She's got no head.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.399
It's not funny.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.639
Shake her up.

46:44.200 --> 46:46.479
So? Nothing happened.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.639
She is dead. The body is cold.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.959
How cold?

46:59.880 --> 47:04.199
One of the spectators
didn't eat the turkey.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.439
He's alive

47:06.600 --> 47:09.079
and watching as we speak.

47:09.800 --> 47:10.919
Damn!

47:12.240 --> 47:13.959
You sure this is true?

47:14.120 --> 47:15.319
Master.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.879
You have to go on.

47:32.890 --> 47:36.199
Okay. Excuse me, please.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.079
I made a little mistake.

47:39.920 --> 47:41.879
Forget everything I just said.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.679
I'm sorry.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.279
I got a little out of myself.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.519
We're not quite done.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.799
How was your relationship with Martina?

48:08.960 --> 48:11.039
- You're bleeding, lieutenant.
- Don't mind that.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.119
It is nothing.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.359
Let's proceed. Answer my question.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.679
Ah, like I've said,

48:17.120 --> 48:19.719
We got along fine, you know,
employee, employer.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.799
You were happy with her work?

48:21.960 --> 48:23.399
Like I said before, Yeah.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.239
Nothing in particular you'd mention?

48:26.240 --> 48:27.240
No.

48:28.960 --> 48:32.319
Were you in contact with her family?

48:32.480 --> 48:36.959
I met her brother once.
He was... ah... rather obese.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.919
We really didn't talk.

48:39.080 --> 48:41.599
Okay. Do you know if Martina was...

48:41.760 --> 48:44.799
in good terms with her obese brother?

48:45.600 --> 48:46.679
Maybe.

48:47.640 --> 48:50.439
Do you think the obese brother...

48:50.600 --> 48:53.319
could be directly or indirectly...

48:53.480 --> 48:55.279
involved with Martina's death?

49:00.680 --> 49:01.680
Mr. Huges?

49:25.600 --> 49:28.039
"Oh God, the kid was right."

49:28.200 --> 49:30.039
"The killer is a tire."

51:03.560 --> 51:05.399
You killed Martina?

51:10.280 --> 51:12.759
You're gonna be in trouble
with the police.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.199
You know what the police are?

51:18.400 --> 51:20.159
Do you talk? I mean...

51:20.320 --> 51:21.479
Talk... Mm...

51:22.480 --> 51:23.479
Me.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.439
Human. Boy.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.719
Answer me!

51:53.720 --> 51:56.039
This is what our killer looks like.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.319
A tire?

51:58.040 --> 51:59.239
Exactly.

52:01.280 --> 52:05.079
I give you an hour to find him.
It can't have run far.

52:05.960 --> 52:07.919
If you have any questions,

52:08.640 --> 52:10.239
It is now or never.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.719
What brand of tire?

52:15.240 --> 52:16.719
We don't know yet.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.239
Probably brandless.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.999
- Is it worn?
- Yes.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.639
Is it black?

52:33.120 --> 52:36.239
It escaped on the road. That way.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.199
So...

53:07.840 --> 53:09.839
What might you fancy?

53:11.240 --> 53:12.879
Farm chicken?

53:13.040 --> 53:17.159
Or maybe potato mashed with olive oil
and mushroom fricassee.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.959
I'll be fine, thank you.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.959
Wait until you see the rest.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.779
Tuna Tartare on a bed of artichoke

53:27.940 --> 53:30.519
with violet flavor and white asparagus.

53:30.680 --> 53:31.799
It's tempting, isn't it?

53:31.960 --> 53:35.039
Okay, you know, I'm not hungry.
So just forget it.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.119
Dessert then, perhaps?

53:47.440 --> 53:49.079
Chocolate eclairs.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.139
It's... whoof... lovely. How could...

53:52.200 --> 53:57.359
Hey, hey, I'm telling you
I'm not hungry, alright?

53:57.520 --> 54:00.879
And you're wasting my time.
Just go away.

54:03.020 --> 54:05.759
Come on. You gotta eat something.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.959
It is unhealthy.

54:09.760 --> 54:12.539
You can't go on like this.
You can't... You...

54:12.760 --> 54:15.399
Have a yoghurt, at least.
Just do that for me.

54:16.120 --> 54:19.079
I just want to watch the end in peace.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.959
Wait all you want,
'cause there is no end.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.519
Fine, I'll watch it anyway, alright?

54:25.680 --> 54:26.919
I like it.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.919
What's happening?

54:32.190 --> 54:36.319
What's happening? He's rolling.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.519
The cops are chasing him.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.239
It's a pretty exciting scene.

54:42.400 --> 54:43.799
Is that so?

54:43.960 --> 54:45.199
Where? I can't see.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.079
Right there. I see it.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.639
- Where?
- Here.

54:50.880 --> 54:51.919
Go on.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.399
Then, one day,

55:54.560 --> 55:57.779
My father wanna do something nice for us

55:57.840 --> 56:01.190
and he took us on a vacation
to the mountain. But...

56:01.920 --> 56:04.319
...because we had no money, we...

56:05.360 --> 56:07.690
...couldn't take a skiing. So...

56:08.080 --> 56:10.039
...along with my brother,

56:10.200 --> 56:13.599
we started going on
these walks in the snow.

56:13.760 --> 56:16.039
We didn't even have shoes.

56:17.480 --> 56:18.759
It's funny...

56:22.760 --> 56:23.799
And then...

56:24.520 --> 56:27.999
my brother... climbs up a rock,

56:28.480 --> 56:31.159
and slips, falls into a crack.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.039
Dumb accident.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.839
You surely don't wanna try the eclair?
It's amazing.

56:37.960 --> 56:39.319
I'm fine, thanks.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.199
where was I?

56:43.360 --> 56:44.519
Ah yeah...

56:46.000 --> 56:48.359
My brother falls into a crack.

56:48.520 --> 56:51.439
and I don't know why,

56:51.600 --> 56:53.559
but instead of offer help,

56:53.720 --> 56:56.679
I take this some enormous rock

56:56.840 --> 57:00.039
and I smash him into the face with it.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.679
And then he stops screaming.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.799
Damn.

57:13.320 --> 57:16.879
You have something for stomache?
I ate too fast.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.519
Oh, shit!

57:28.720 --> 57:31.119
That stuff was supposed to be
for you to eat!

57:35.480 --> 57:36.919
Oh God, it burns!

57:38.840 --> 57:40.679
I don't want to die!

57:45.760 --> 57:47.359
Help me!

57:53.440 --> 57:55.959
Help me. Oh God, please!

58:00.480 --> 58:02.039
Oh, it burns!

58:04.240 --> 58:08.199
I'm going to die! I don't want to die!

58:12.520 --> 58:13.879
Help me please. Help me...

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.599
You can't do that.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.839
Really?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.919
Well, you can if you want,
but it's against the rules.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.319
So what... can I or can't I?

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.799
Unit 4 central. You receive?

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.679
We located the tire.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.799
You receive?

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.119
I repeat. We located the tire
inside a house.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.759
You're on.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.079
We receive you, unit 4.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.359
What did you mean by "located"?

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.439
We just saw him.
He's in a house on Belly Ball Road,

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.239
watching TV. What should we do?

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.439
Stay put. We're on our way.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.479
You alright?

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.839
We're gonna neck him.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.479
The door just opened. He's coming.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.359
Alright, go ahead, read.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.039
Come.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.679
Closer.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.979
Come on. Closer. I was expecting you.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.839
Come on. Come here.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.199
Articulate.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.959
Come on. Come here.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.079
"Come here and kill me,
you son of a bitch."

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.439
Come closer and kill me,
you little jerk.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.199
Stick to the text. Go on.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.759
Son of a bitch.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.519
Come on.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.199
Closer.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.359
That's good. He's biting.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.519
Go on.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.839
Come on.
You know I've been very naughty.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.719
You have to punish me.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.439
Come. Come punish me.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.279
Who wrote this garbage?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.199
Don't worry about that. Go on.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.359
You like me?

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.479
You think I'm sexy?

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.159
Come on, be a good boy,

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.919
blow my head off, you big slut...

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.159
Sorry, I can't read that.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.719
It is too awful.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.519
Get out of the way.
You're gonna ruin everything.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.319
Blow my head off, you big slut.
You hear me?

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.719
I have a very...
I have been a very naughtly girl.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:08.959
I need a good thrashing.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.859
Come on, now! Go ahead.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.319
Kill me! Go on!

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.279
I want to die.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.479
Do it!

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.259
I think he suspects something.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.879
I think we should stay
with the woman's voice.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:22.919
Shit!

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.479
Take back the mic.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.159
Come on. Go ahead! Go ahead! Come on!

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.839
Where are we?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.919
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Improvise. Quick!

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.359
Hey, blow my head off.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.679
What're you wait for?

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.959
Very good. Go on.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.889
Come on, I'm ready! Now!

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.579
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you, but...

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.759
The way I look at it,
this scene makes no sense at all.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.439
And not that as great as we began
with, for at least I understood it.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.039
Now, it's uh... it's totally confused.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.119
That's why I took the trouble
to come over this way.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.359
What do you mean?
What don't you understand?

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.079
What don't I understand is
the bait with the dummy.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.639
It doesn't make sense. And what's
the point? What's the purpose?

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.019
Can't you see, it's a lure.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.639
There's nothing confusing.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.479
Yeah, I get the lure, okay?
I am not stupid.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.519
What I don't get is why
it takes so many hours.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.499
Why don't you just ice the bloody tire?

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.799
Now that he's...

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.679
He's standing in front of
the lure dummy,

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.759
with a Bazooka-
even better, no, no, listen, listen--

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.279
even better, you get one of
your guys with a flamethrower.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.780
Just woo!

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.159
You gotta do something. I mean,
do something, anything.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.960
No, no...

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.839
The idea was for him to blow up the
dummy himself instead of the dynamite.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.199
That way, he will pop
himself off himself, so to speak.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.959
That's brilliant. That's actually
brilliant. What I'm asking...

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.119
is speed up the action. That's all.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.119
You know? Boom, boom!

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.599
Yeah. But then we wouldn't be here
if you've eaten the damn turkey.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.959
That's true enough, but...

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.269
Listen, we like you told us.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.919
We will try to speed things up now.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.599
- You can go back to your place.
- Thank you.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.079
Asshole.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.759
Who's that guy?

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.999
Come on, let's get on with it.
I'm exhausted.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.879
Read the last sentence there.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.079
You're nothing but a rubber shit.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.319
Once again.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.839
You're nothing but a rubber shit.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.789
Again.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.359
You're nothing but a rubber shit.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.799
damn, it didn't work.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.519
May I ask what you intend to do?

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.559
I'm gonna blow up this
rubber shit myself. Be done with it.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.999
No. You can't do that.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.078
What about the dummy blow-up?

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.479
You promised man.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.198
"The End". Bye.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.279
That's it, ah?

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.679
That's all you got?

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.719
You can't stop here man.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.719
Come on. What kind of racket you wanted?

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:08.919
Wait!

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.759
It is not the end.
It's been reincarnated in a tricycle.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.118
Come back!

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.439
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:23.839
I'm not a character. I'm just watching.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.839
You just stay there.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.959
Stay put.

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.719
No, stay put!

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.319
Good.

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:52.159
Sync: SalaKrestu

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.159
In the Steven Spielberg movie "E.T.",

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.679
why's the alien brown?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.159
No reason.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.639
In "Love Story",

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.519
why did the two characters
fall madly in love with each other?

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.239
No reason.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.319
In Oliver Stone's "JFK",

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.319
Why's the President suddenly
assassinated by some stranger?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.999
No reason.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.279
In the excellent "Chainsaw Massacre"
by Tobe Hooper,

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.319
why don't we ever see the characters
go to the bathroom...

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.119
or wash their hands,
like people doing in real life?

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.999
Absolutely no reason.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.479
Worse, in "The Pianist" by Polanski,

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.679
how come this guy has to hide
and live like a bomb...

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.279
when he plays the piano so well?

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.399
Once again the answer is...

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.039
"no reason".

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.599
I could go on for hours with
more examples. The list is endless.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.439
You probably never gave it
a moment's thought.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.959
But all great films, without exception,

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.159
contain an important element--
a "no reason".

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.799
And you know why?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.159
Because life itself is made up
of tonnes...

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.999
of "no reason".

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.359
Why can't we see the air all around us?

01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.679
No reason.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.199
Why're we always thinking?

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.879
No reason.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.359
Why do some people love sausages
and other people hate sausages?

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.359
No fuckin' reason.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.239
Come on, don't waste your time
explaining that garbage. Let's go!

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.879
Just one minute. Let me finish.
