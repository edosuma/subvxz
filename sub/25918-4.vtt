WEBVTT

00:09.217 --> 00:12.053
In this episode,
we are off to Brooklyn, New York.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.264
-Wow!
-It's a beautiful girl.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.933
This beautiful brownstone
specializes in big groups,

00:17.017 --> 00:19.352
but its design is a big disaster.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.104
It feels like a youth hostel.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.648
-Whoa!
-There's a bed in the lobby. I'm confused.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.944
We're going to show the owner
how to be best in his category.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.697
This is setting yourself
above the competition.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.782
And transform this tired property...

00:32.866 --> 00:35.869
It feels more open.
I'm excited to see what it'll look like.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.579
...into a real crowd-pleaser.

00:38.955 --> 00:39.789
Beautiful!

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.440 --> 01:06.274
Smile.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.779
We're in Times Square.
Where the hell's the property?

01:10.862 --> 01:14.074
I kept it a secret, because A,
this is my hometown

01:14.157 --> 01:16.576
and B, I just wanted
to surprise your pants off!

01:16.659 --> 01:20.371
-So it's not Manhattan?
-No. Manhattan is so unaffordable, right?

01:20.830 --> 01:21.664
It's ridiculous.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.125
Today, we're going to go to Brooklyn.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.461
Let's go!

01:36.763 --> 01:40.391
Uninterrupted rows and rows and rows
of brownstones.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.560
That's what I love about Brooklyn.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.775
62 million people
come to visit  New York City every year.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.361
It's one of the greatest cities
in the world,

01:51.444 --> 01:54.989
but New York's not cheap and
there's a great opportunity for travelers

01:55.073 --> 01:57.700
to save money
and have a unique experience.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.411
They just have to head over the bridge
to Brooklyn.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.748
Brooklyn is the epicenter
of cool and creativity,

02:03.832 --> 02:07.001
from music to makers,
food to furniture design.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.922
I was digging through the numbers
and Brooklyn alone

02:11.005 --> 02:16.511
brings in $309 million dollars a year

02:16.594 --> 02:19.806
Airbnb, VRBO.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.518
That's 14,000 short-term rentals.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.730
To succeed in this market,  you really
have to have something special.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.107
Let's look.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.276
This is the property
you were talking about.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.944
-Yes.
-The Yellow Block Inn.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.946
It's in the Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.532
There are seven bedrooms
and five bathrooms.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.075
I love the fact

02:39.159 --> 02:42.245
that this property is so big,
and he specializes in renting it

02:42.328 --> 02:44.956
to large groups.
That really makes it special to me

02:45.039 --> 02:47.625
and it could save travelers
a lot of money.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.670
But on a business front,
here's the problem.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.505
It looks like a youth hostel.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.341
I just don't see a common area
big enough for large groups.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.178
And the kitchen
is in a sad state.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.388
There's only 98 other homes

03:00.471 --> 03:02.140
that are competition for us.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.268
So we just need to make him the best
to beat out the competition.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.395
Looks like we got a bunch of work.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.859
The house is right around
the corner. Let's hop out here.

03:14.110 --> 03:18.489
Close your eyes. We have a little surprise
and delight at the end of our block.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.201
-Okay.
-Actually, a big surprise and delight.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.619
Open your eyes.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.999
Oh, wow!

03:28.082 --> 03:29.292
Some history, huh?

03:31.127 --> 03:33.087
This is major!

03:33.171 --> 03:34.672
The Notorious B.I.G.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.007
He was one of my heroes.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.052
Before getting into real estate,

03:39.135 --> 03:42.472
I was a successful record producer
and international DJ.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.684
Biggie's influence on me,
and music as a whole, was massive.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.270
Our house is literally down this walk.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.313
-Right here?
-Yeah.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.148
You can have coffee with Biggie
every morning.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.692
I bet his competition doesn't have Biggie.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.116
-Wow!
-It's a beautiful girl.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.868
-She's gorgeous!
-I know.

04:04.035 --> 04:08.331
This place to me is exactly what I
imagined for a brownstone in Brooklyn.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.709
-Gordy!
-Gordy.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.003
So glad you guys made it.
How was the trip in?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.755
-Hi! Nice to meet you, finally.
-Wonderful.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.757
Do I get a hug?

04:19.007 --> 04:21.386
-Welcome to Brooklyn. Welcome to Bed-Stuy.
-Thanks.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.346
The house welcomes you.
Brooklyn welcomes you.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.139
My name is Gordy.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.934
I've been living in Brooklyn since 1996.

04:28.017 --> 04:32.146
I'm the proud father of three sons,
Cairo, Caleb, and Caden,

04:32.230 --> 04:33.856
and I love being their dad.

04:34.023 --> 04:37.610
I would like to have this opportunity
to partner with experts,

04:37.694 --> 04:39.487
because I know that if I earn more,

04:39.570 --> 04:43.116
then I can save money for
my children's education in the future.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.036
The house was built in 1899,
so it was here long before I arrived.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.289
About 2,700 square feet in total.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.124
The first floor, we have a few bedrooms.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.043
Second floor, a few more bedrooms
for guests. We stay on the top floor.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.753
What do you hope to get out of this?

04:55.837 --> 04:58.965
My goal is to keep the price the same.
I want to keep it affordable.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.426
This is a working-class community.
We want working class folks

05:01.509 --> 05:04.637
from all over the world to come to it
and enjoy it and live locally.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.597
-You're hosting big groups.
-I am.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.225
Groups are my specialty.
I host groups, 14 or 15 people.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.893
-Nice.
-So they can come in like a family

05:10.977 --> 05:12.979
and enjoy their stay
and really enjoy the space.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.814
-I have a question for you.
-Absolutely.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.899
Yellow block. Tell me what that is.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.359
Well, my oldest son, Cairo,

05:18.443 --> 05:19.861
was about four or five.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.864
Every morning, I'd take him to day care.
Before we would leave the house,

05:22.947 --> 05:24.657
he'd say,
"Daddy, where's the yellow block?"

05:24.741 --> 05:27.368
It was a yellow Lego.
If he didn't have his yellow block,

05:27.452 --> 05:29.579
-his day wouldn't start the same.
-His security blanket.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.747
-Yes.
-So sweet.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.791
I associate Yellow Block
with him feeling secure.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.086
It makes him feel good. Anything I do
associated with Yellow Block

05:37.170 --> 05:40.798
makes me feel good. I want to pass that
to guests who come here.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.801
-Alright, Gordy, take us in.
-Right up the steps. Welcome.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.720
I'm in love with this place already.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.847
I need some new eyes on this project.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.808
I'm not an expert in renovation.
I'm not an expert at business.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.145
So to have Gen and Peter
come and help me means everything.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.772
After you.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.399
So this is... the mudroom?

05:58.483 --> 06:02.070
This is the entrance way, the mudroom,
the welcoming area.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.156
How does big groups come in here?

06:05.239 --> 06:07.450
-What happens when they all... ?
-It's a little tough.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.745
-I presume this is the lobby?
-It is. This is the lobby here.

06:10.828 --> 06:14.582
-With a bed?
-Well, no. This the king-size bedroom.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.626
Alright, I'm totally confused now.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.419
-If you've got 14 guests...
-Sure.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.713
...coming up the stairs
with suitcases and backpacks,

06:20.797 --> 06:23.758
they can't fit there.
There's a bed in the lobby.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.344
-I'm confused.
-It's kind of a lobby bedroom.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.054
Okay. Let me just stop you.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.889
Is it a bedroom or is it a lobby?

06:29.972 --> 06:33.434
No. There's also an entrance downstairs
where we bring folks into the kitchen.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.978
-I see.
-Let's take a look at it.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.439
Lead the way.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.316
So this is another entrance.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.403
-Okay, I see you.
-Thank you.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.948
Do they know naturally
to come down here or not?

06:47.031 --> 06:49.951
I don't think they know what to expect.
They're arriving,

06:50.034 --> 06:52.787
and they trust when they come
they're going to get in through a door.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.872
I think we need
to spell that out for them.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.834
You don't want people to be arriving
at midnight or two in the morning,

06:57.917 --> 07:00.711
and then figuring out which door,
hauling their cases upstairs.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.506
That's the difference between hotels
and home shares.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.508
Hotels, you know someone's
waiting for you.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.260
-Sure.
-Home shares, you don't.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.387
But, like hotels,

07:09.470 --> 07:13.349
they front-load all their money
into that first greeting, the lobby.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.226
-This is the lobby?
-Well, no.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.853
This is kind of a bedroom.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.105
Down here, I have the kitchen.
I have a common area

07:19.188 --> 07:21.858
which is like a dining area,
where it would happen, right here.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.109
Okay.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.320
This area here symbolizes
the meeting place, right?

07:26.404 --> 07:29.157
So if there's a special event,
if a group comes in,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.117
this is where they'll spend their time.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.953
What would you say is the percentage
of international to domestic?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.830
I'd say probably 60% to 70%.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.039
-Wow.
-That's massive.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.334
That's folks who travel across the world
to come here.

07:40.418 --> 07:44.255
We should talk about that, because
the type of guests you're having here

07:44.338 --> 07:47.675
are going to need something to help
guide them and tell them where to go.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.719
-Let's get into that kitchen.
-Can you show us it?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.053
-Sure.
-Okay, great.

07:55.516 --> 08:00.229
I mean, this is tight. Probably like six
foot something, maybe seven foot wide.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.774
Part of the home share deal
is they always want to cook.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.194
-That's right.
-Especially if you're on a budget

08:06.277 --> 08:08.988
in New York, the last thing you want to do
is buy expensive food.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.324
You want to spend it on getting around
and seeing things.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.368
-Absolutely.
-So I feel, since this is really a place

08:14.452 --> 08:16.412
that you're wanting to support groups,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.247
we need to build a group kitchen.

08:18.414 --> 08:22.627
So my first thought is that
we need to take out that wall,

08:22.710 --> 08:24.086
take out this wall.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.130
All the way back, all of it.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.425
-Fantastic!
-So we're gonna open up this ground level.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.179
Wait. You mean... taking a room out?
Making a room disappear?

08:33.261 --> 08:35.765
But you gain a lobby/dining room.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.642
I didn't envision losing a bedroom.

08:37.725 --> 08:42.355
You're not losing a bedroom. Your guests
are gaining a beautiful common area

08:42.438 --> 08:43.940
where 15 people can hang out.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.733
-Okay
-Let's head upstairs.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.109
Let's go upstairs.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.530
-Check out this room right here.
-Okay.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.241
Jeez, you got a lot of rooms, Gordy.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.077
Whoa! This is a statement!

08:56.160 --> 08:58.996
-The Ocean Room.
-Okay if I switch up the color here?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.874
-I welcome the change.
-Great color, but a little aggressive!

09:02.667 --> 09:03.584
Little bit dark.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.546
This room is pretty standard.
Can sleep two folks.

09:06.629 --> 09:10.591
Money has always been a factor in terms of
how I design and put the house together.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.718
There's no door! Where's the door?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.053
There was a door!

09:14.136 --> 09:15.721
I've been freestyling since day one.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.684
Then this room here,
the Blue Powder Room.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.812
You know, this is a nice size.
It's not too big.

09:22.937 --> 09:23.938
It's not too small.

09:24.021 --> 09:27.608
So whatever we do in here can set
the tone for the whole spectrum...

09:27.692 --> 09:28.818
-Sure.
-...of rooms.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.113
What I want to do is, like,
these tiny hotel rooms

09:32.196 --> 09:34.198
popping up as of late everywhere,

09:34.282 --> 09:37.493
whether you're sleeping in a pod
or it's the size of your closet.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.663
Yes, I'm saving money,
but I'm also being taken care of.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.498
-I'm in. Let's do it.
-I like it.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.585
On budget but on high style.
It will look fierce.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.962
-Let's do it. I'm excited.
-Alright, let's go.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.383
Now that we've seen the house,
it's time to get down to dollars and cents

09:52.466 --> 09:54.844
and come up with
a new business plan for Gordy.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.682
Okay, Gordy.
So let's talk a little business.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.185
What goals do you have?
What you want to achieve from this?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.230
To continue to try to save money.
The more I can save,

10:06.314 --> 10:08.107
the more I make,
the more I can do for my kids.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.152
I have three sons
I would like to send to college.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.779
I think that's totally possible.
So, in Brooklyn,

10:13.863 --> 10:16.866
there are 14,000 residences
doing home share right now.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.744
-You are one of a niche.
-Sure.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.038
-You do groups, more than ten people.
-Sure.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.958
There are only 98 properties
that do ten or more.

10:26.042 --> 10:26.876
Wow!

10:27.293 --> 10:29.211
And the riches are always in the niches.

10:29.712 --> 10:35.092
Between Gen and I, we want to make
you rise to the very top of that 98.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.636
-Wow!
-And I don't see any reason

10:36.719 --> 10:38.971
-why we can't do that.
-Yeah. Let's go up.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.806
Who do you have helping you

10:40.890 --> 10:44.435
as far as cleaning and making sure
everything looks the same every day?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.520
Initially, I did a lot of the work myself

10:46.604 --> 10:49.231
and my sons would come in and give me
a hand. They still do

10:49.315 --> 10:52.068
when it doesn't interfere with school
and stuff like that.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.945
It's a great experience for the kids.
They get to learn a little bit

10:55.029 --> 10:57.365
about a good work ethic
and how to be disciplined.

10:57.448 --> 11:01.661
You're not particularly interested
in raising the daily rate?

11:01.744 --> 11:04.163
-Not at all.
-We need to work on your occupancy.

11:04.246 --> 11:08.501
Now, your occupancy is pretty low.
The Brooklyn average is about 80%.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.629
-Is that the highest in the country?
-One of the highest.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.422
You're charging $900 a night

11:13.506 --> 11:15.216
and you booked about 13 nights a month,

11:15.299 --> 11:18.344
which is approximately 45% occupancy.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.680
That means you're making
about 12,000 a month,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.432
or a total of $144,000 a year.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.687
We think you can increase your occupancy
to 20 nights a month,

11:27.770 --> 11:30.064
which will give you 18,000 a month.

11:30.147 --> 11:33.317
That's $216,000 a year,

11:33.401 --> 11:36.153
which is an increase of $72,000.

11:36.237 --> 11:41.033
I would love it. There's a lot of space
for growth. 35% more increase is exciting.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.204
You've got the home, you've got the story,
we've got you, and you're a dream.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.666
-So we'll make this happen this week.
-Sounds exciting. I'm in.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.711
-I feel like I wanna hug him again!
-Don't mind me!

12:04.014 --> 12:07.017
Now we have a business plan
for Gordy to be the best in his category:

12:07.101 --> 12:08.602
hosting large groups.

12:08.686 --> 12:12.773
To beat his competition, we have to design
a killer lobby and kitchen area.

12:12.857 --> 12:16.235
We're also going to upgrade the bedrooms
with a unified look

12:16.318 --> 12:17.653
and better space planning.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.906
We're going to help Gordy to create
a guidebook to Brooklyn and Bed-Stuy.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.201
That way guests can enjoy the city
without any confusion.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.996
We'll also teach him a thing or two about
an important part

12:27.079 --> 12:29.790
housekeeping.

12:29.874 --> 12:34.128
And, finally, we'll look for a unique
marketing hook for the Yellow Block Inn.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.302
-Can you give me the layout?
-Yeah.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.095
-Living space behind us.
-Okay.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.807
-Great.
-And then long communal dining table.

12:46.891 --> 12:47.975
-Ten feet.
-Fabulous.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.227
Gordy will have a new open-plan layout

12:50.311 --> 12:51.979
and we'll remove this bedroom,

12:52.062 --> 12:55.566
which will allow us to create
more of a lobby-like entrance area

12:55.649 --> 12:57.818
that leads into an open-concept kitchen,

12:57.902 --> 13:01.530
making this a great space
for large groups of renters.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.033
How much better and bigger does this feel?

13:04.116 --> 13:05.785
I can't even imagine. This is great.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.204
We got to go meet Peter.
Let's let them demo all this.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.748
-We're surely not as fast.
-Alright, cool. Let's go.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.127
-Pretty epic, right?
-That's a lot.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.337
We got a lot going on.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.135
I hear he has
a whole pigeon coop up there.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.345
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.806
With the renovation
moving full speed ahead,

13:26.889 --> 13:30.184
it's time to start working on
the rest of Gordy's business plan,

13:30.267 --> 13:32.269
which includes creating a guidebook.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.398
It's no surprise that Brooklyn
is a hot spot

13:36.482 --> 13:38.359
for short-term rentals and tourism.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.529
It has a thriving
food and entertainment scene

13:41.612 --> 13:44.281
that has grown to rival
any vacation destination.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.033
For your guest book,

13:46.116 --> 13:48.577
you need to show your guests
how to live like a local.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.121
Some of the most beautiful homes
in New York City

13:51.205 --> 13:55.543
are found here Bedford-Stuyvesant and
it's become the heart of re-gentrification

13:55.626 --> 13:58.546
We have folks here
who are from all diverse backgrounds.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.047
Let's do it. Let's go!

14:00.130 --> 14:01.632
David's Brisket's a local brisket shop.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.760
The New York deli thing
translates globally.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.809
The subway is the lifeline
of New York.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.769
-Will you get to Manhattan here?
-Yep.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.730
Gordy, you've got to include a map
of the subway in your guidebook.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.901
We've had some famous rappers
come out of Bed-Stuy,

14:20.985 --> 14:22.486
from Biggie Smalls to Jay-Z.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.822
The neighborhood is hip, it's hot.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.200
What comes out of Bed-Stuy drives a lot
of the fabric of the hip-hop culture.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.828
-Come here and let me show you something.
-We'll cross over.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.083
-Where do you know these guys from?
-Fifty's from the block.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.919
I've been here for 40 years.
I know the whole hood.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.755
This is the corner where the battle
started where Big was at.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.509
That video that we've all seen
where he's on the street.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.511
That was right across the street.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.596
-Wow!
-Yeah.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.473
So did you know the Old Gold Brothers
and the Techniques?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.393
-I am an Old Gold Brother.
-Get out!

14:54.518 --> 14:55.352
Oh, sh--

14:57.438 --> 15:01.400
I had no idea, man!
This guy started it!

15:01.483 --> 15:04.194
You have no idea.
This is where the sound came from.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.946
-The Old Gold Brothers.
-Old Gold Brothers.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.073
-Original member!
-OGB.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.367
Damn, this is exciting!

15:11.035 --> 15:13.871
-I'm kinda like...
-You thought I was just a DJ, right?

15:14.288 --> 15:16.790
I didn't realize you were part of OGB!

15:16.874 --> 15:19.752
The demo that we did
is what got Big signed.

15:19.919 --> 15:24.173
This is a lyric from the original
demo tape that got B.I.G.  signed.

15:24.256 --> 15:28.636
I'm standing on the corner beneath
the lyrics that the Old Gold Brothers,

15:28.719 --> 15:32.264
this guy, did a demo with Notorious B.I.G.

15:32.348 --> 15:36.226
that got him signed to Uptown Records
with Sean "Puffy" Combs.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.897
I mean, this is a true Brooklyn
experience I'm having right now,

15:39.980 --> 15:41.315
and this is my first time here.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.609
We're spreading love.
It's the Brooklyn way.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.739
Peter and Gordy
are working on the guidebook,

15:48.822 --> 15:53.035
but for me, it's time to really start
making my mood board a tangible thing

15:53.118 --> 15:54.703
in Gordy's short-term rental.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.998
The color palette, which will include
his signature color, yellow.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.126
I'll also be using wall coverings
that give his smaller rooms

16:01.210 --> 16:02.503
a greater sense of depth.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.381
And I want to use as much local
and Brooklyn authentic materials

16:05.464 --> 16:07.925
as I possibly can for the furniture items,

16:08.008 --> 16:10.844
like what they make right here
at Recycled Brooklyn.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.474
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

16:15.557 --> 16:16.725
Nice to see you.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.270
I'm getting the guys at Recycled Brooklyn
to build a giant dining table,

16:20.354 --> 16:21.647
perfect for group meals.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.150
I want to create a table that can seat,
like, 14.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.903
-I'm thinking, like, ten feet.
-Sure.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.573
It'll be like the real centerpiece,
 the spine of the whole first floor.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.909
No pressure at all, guys!

16:33.993 --> 16:35.869
-You got it!
-Just make it perfect.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.543
While Genevieve redesigns
Gordy's property,

16:42.626 --> 16:46.171
I'm showing him ways to upgrade
various aspects of his business,

16:46.255 --> 16:47.631
like the art of housekeeping.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.633
-This is my friend Marcia.
-Hi.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.887
She is a luxury hotel bed specialist

16:53.971 --> 16:56.223
with one of the finest careers
in the city.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.560
You've made over 25,000 beds.
Would that be fair?

16:59.643 --> 17:00.811
Yes, it would be.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.187
You're going to show us

17:02.271 --> 17:04.064
-exactly how to make a luxury bed.
-Yes.

17:04.147 --> 17:07.443
The bed is the largest piece
of furniture in the room,

17:07.943 --> 17:13.031
and the minute you walk in the door,
the bed should be inviting.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.700
-I see.
-The guests should feel

17:14.782 --> 17:16.535
at home away from home.

17:16.993 --> 17:19.079
-So it's guest experience?
-Yes. It is.

17:19.663 --> 17:24.626
Well, I think in order for us to find out
exactly how to make the bed...

17:24.710 --> 17:27.421
-Yes.
-...we've got to mess the bed up first.

17:27.503 --> 17:31.967
You guys, kick your shoes off
and jump up and down in that bed. Quick!

17:32.051 --> 17:32.926
Come on, kids!

17:37.306 --> 17:40.059
Okay, let's go ahead and pull
all the sheets off the bed.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.020
-Get everything off the bed.
-Want me to help you? Pull it off.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.651
Let me show you how we make
a hospital corner.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.987
You lift and spread.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.156
Tuck the sheet at the top.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.741
You sweep.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.659
And then you tuck again.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.996
One final trick
to get out all the wrinkles.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.207
I use a fabric refresher.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.500
I lightly spray...

18:04.625 --> 18:06.335
Oh... okay!

18:06.543 --> 18:08.545
-Cool!
-Isn't it?

18:08.629 --> 18:11.507
-Got it!
-You got it? Okay!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.885
Now that we've learned
a thing or two about housekeeping,

18:14.968 --> 18:17.930
I want Gordy to deliver the best
experience for his guests.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.100
It's absolutely crucial that he have
a great guidebook.

18:21.391 --> 18:25.270
So to get a little help, I'm introducing
him to my friend Michelle,

18:25.354 --> 18:27.439
who is a professional guidebook writer.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.858
Wow! Look at this.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.237
So here we are. South Street Seaport,
One World Trade Center,

18:33.362 --> 18:36.865
Lower Manhattan, other old skyscrapers.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.909
-Wow! Gordy?
-Yeah?

18:38.992 --> 18:40.202
I wanted you to meet Michelle,

18:40.285 --> 18:43.914
because Michelle has created a book

18:43.997 --> 18:46.834
and a website of untapped experiences.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.753
One of the most crucial things
with short-term rental

18:49.837 --> 18:52.631
is we have to provide a guidebook.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.550
You don't have one right now.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.969
I dropped the ball on this one.
That's being straight-up.

18:57.052 --> 19:00.931
A lot of times, people don't really know
exactly where they're staying.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.643
They want to get to know the neighborhood,
get tips from someone that lives here.

19:04.726 --> 19:08.730
It helps you provide an insider
perspective to your neighborhood

19:08.814 --> 19:10.149
and the place that you live in.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.485
The things that are well-known,
but also your favorite spots.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.863
-Sure.
-Then you can put your notes on there.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.490
Like, if it's a restaurant,
what's your favorite dish?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.659
What's the price range?
Is it good for kids?

19:20.742 --> 19:22.077
Nice!

19:22.202 --> 19:24.204
The idea to put together a guide book

19:24.288 --> 19:27.207
that carves out the local experience
is a good choice.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.960
You have to be attentive
to the needs of guests.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.337
You have to make their stay
your priority.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.923
You can't put people in your house
and think everything is sweet.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.425
Thank you so much, Michelle.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.262
Any time I can enhance
the guest experience, I'm excited.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.815
Our new communal kitchen
is halfway done.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.943
The new cabinets are adding
a ton of work space,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.320
so groups can cook together.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.323
And on the front gate,
we're going with bright yellow

19:59.406 --> 20:02.367
to help guests avoid any confusion
as to where they enter.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.662
In the master bedroom, we're building
a floor-to-ceiling headboard

20:05.746 --> 20:07.164
to maximize the small space.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.792
So we built the bed...
This is the headboard

20:10.959 --> 20:13.212
...up to the top of the ceiling. Why?

20:13.295 --> 20:15.631
Because when things are more vertical,

20:15.714 --> 20:19.343
they move your eyes up the wall
and away from that tiny footprint,

20:19.426 --> 20:22.888
so it gives the illusion that things
are actually bigger than they are.

20:22.971 --> 20:27.434
Amenities go here.
Tray, water, disposable glasses, books.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.770
Feels light, bright and happy.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.111
Part of Gordy's business plan
is that he needs to step up his marketing

20:38.195 --> 20:40.364
to build a brand
that stands out from the crowd.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.533
That's why I'm taking him to see
how it's done

20:43.617 --> 20:44.618
with flying colors.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.286
So, Gordy, with large groups,

20:46.370 --> 20:48.413
you've really got to provide a breakfast.

20:48.497 --> 20:52.834
So I wanted to bring you to a place
that's crazy memorable. This is Scot.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.795
-Gordy, Scot.
-Pleasure to meet you.

20:54.878 --> 20:58.966
Scot here created the now world-famous
rainbow bagel.

20:59.049 --> 21:03.178
Bread and bagels have always been my
passion in life. I've always been creative

21:03.262 --> 21:04.137
in that area.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.973
So I took to it as my canvas.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.767
-It looks awesome. You've done it.
-Exactly.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.644
-I appreciate that.
-This is marketing.

21:10.727 --> 21:14.398
This is setting yourself above
the rest of the competition.

21:14.481 --> 21:19.486
You need to provide something memorable,
that they're gonna take photos of,

21:19.569 --> 21:21.697
that they're going to post
on social media.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.491
-What do you think?
-Beautiful. Never seen a bagel like it.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.159
-Me neither.
-It has different colors.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.452
It looks almost like a dessert.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.580
I think it's pretty clear
what Scot has done with his bagel

21:30.664 --> 21:35.335
in terms of branding. If I can transfer
those skills to my rental business,

21:35.419 --> 21:39.339
and create a unique niche, I think we
have something that people won't forget.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.676
People are not forgetting about
the rainbow bagel. That's a fact.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.226
Now.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.769
Yeah!

21:53.645 --> 21:56.189
Beautiful! My hall tree
for the mudroom.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.441
-Got it?
-Yep.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.402
After this, please bring in
the new dining table.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.529
This is the chaos before the calm.

22:02.612 --> 22:06.700
Everyone's working round-the-clock.
The kitchen is ready... ish.

22:06.783 --> 22:10.162
Gordy's been working on a guidebook
for his guests of things in Brooklyn.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.040
We brought in a sign artist
to create a chalkboard wall

22:13.123 --> 22:15.292
where he can download
all of his suggestions.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.919
Now it's just about
all those detailed layers.

22:18.462 --> 22:23.675
When you need a polish or you have
a watermark on your tables or surfaces,

22:23.759 --> 22:25.802
mayonnaise is your best friend.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.764
It acts like the thickest lotion
you'd put on your hand

22:28.847 --> 22:30.223
in winter when you're the driest,

22:30.307 --> 22:32.684
and it makes the wood look like new.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.478
And you did it yourself for $2.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.490
The Yellow Block Inn
is almost ready to reopen for business.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.449
Here we go.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.330
Great photographs
are the most important tool

22:53.413 --> 22:56.583
to sell your short-term rental
and beat the competition.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.335
We want to deliver the best for Gordy,

22:58.418 --> 23:01.004
so I brought my photographer Cris
from Los Angeles.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.966
Most group-stay places don't have details.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.597
Those are very Instagrammable too.

23:12.015 --> 23:12.974
So this is great.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.309
This is really important.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.728
Yeah! There we go.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.983
the surprise.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.410
-How you doing?
-Good.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.579
-Good to see you.
-Wow, look at this!

23:37.999 --> 23:39.084
That beautiful!

23:41.336 --> 23:43.880
The door looks great.
I didn't have a sign before.

23:44.005 --> 23:47.342
Exactly! One of the first things now
when your guests arrive, they'll roll up

23:47.426 --> 23:49.386
and there's no confusion.

23:49.469 --> 23:53.223
You've got a nice big "enter" sign that
even somebody with my glasses can see.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.641
It's inviting. It feels warm.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.143
I'm dying to see the inside.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.936
-Come in!
-Yeah!

23:59.938 --> 24:01.398
Okay.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.028
Look at this! The chairs are beautiful.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.822
You guys did not miss a beat.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.074
Beautiful!

24:11.491 --> 24:14.077
You see how vast
this communal area is now?

24:14.161 --> 24:17.622
-I cannot believe this is the same house.
-It feels like it has a soul.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.540
It's hot.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.250
Wow!

24:20.834 --> 24:23.795
Wow, you guys. This is...
Look at the space!

24:23.879 --> 24:26.006
-Look at you!
-What happened to the wall?

24:26.089 --> 24:27.340
The wall has gone.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.967
There's no more confusion.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.887
Remember what it was like before?
There was a little room here.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.305
There was a bedroom...

24:33.472 --> 24:35.265
two beds, it was closed off.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.767
Now I come in, no more wall. It's gone.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.687
Now this is a proper entry way
for large groups.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.772
It's beyond what I would have imagined.

24:42.856 --> 24:47.527
We went over design plans and talked about
what things could possibly look like,

24:47.611 --> 24:50.363
but I think until you walk in
and you actually see it,

24:50.447 --> 24:51.615
you don't have any idea.

24:51.698 --> 24:52.866
Where did you guys find this?

24:52.949 --> 24:54.534
This is from Brooklyn Recycled.

24:54.618 --> 24:58.455
They built this and they built
this beautiful dining table by hand.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.916
All old rafters, floorboards
from Brooklyn brownstones.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.834
-Beautiful!
-They reuse them.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.296
Nothing says communal more than this.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.341
When people look at this
from the other side of the planet,

25:09.424 --> 25:12.886
you can have all 14 people that can stay

25:12.969 --> 25:14.804
all eat at once.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.016
The kitchen before was functional.
It worked.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.768
But I think this kitchen just complements

25:19.851 --> 25:21.019
what groups need.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.981
-What does this say right here?
-Yellow Block B&amp;B.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.568
And all of your guests are going to
take pictures in front of this.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.488
-So what is that for you? Free marketing.
-Yes.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.823
Now you have a guidebook
in your common room,

25:33.907 --> 25:35.450
I need you to do your part.

25:35.825 --> 25:40.705
I need you to fill in, eventually, top
breakfast spots, lunch, dinner, bars...

25:40.789 --> 25:41.748
-Okay.
-In addition,

25:41.831 --> 25:44.793
this is your digital guest book.

25:45.877 --> 25:46.711
Wow!

25:47.921 --> 25:51.007
Guests come in.
Confusion is now removed.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.385
Theyr'e gonna know
which restaurants to go to.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.888
How to get around New York,
what the attractions are they should see,

25:56.972 --> 25:58.765
-how to work the wi-fi.
-Okay.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.810
One word I would definitely use
coming into this house is innovative.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.061
They took the space,

26:03.144 --> 26:06.565
they kept in mind
what my practical, simple style was,

26:06.648 --> 26:09.526
and they incorporated it
with what was best for the guests.

26:09.609 --> 26:12.862
No one's gonna want to leave. Everything
is here that you can possibly think of.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.031
That's what a good home is, though, right?

26:15.115 --> 26:17.659
-A good home is like...
-Everything right on the spot.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.619
Hotels don't have that peace.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.829
-No.
-But you do.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.539
You've even got your laundry in the back.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.332
-There's laundry in the back?
-Yes.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.418
-Can we check it out?
-Of course!

26:31.256 --> 26:32.257
I love the room!

26:32.340 --> 26:34.217
We turned your old kitchen
into a laundry room.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.802
Now guests can come in,

26:35.927 --> 26:38.346
I don't have to send them
to the laundromat.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.683
If you think this is great,
wait till you see the rooms upstairs.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.479
Look at this!

26:46.563 --> 26:47.731
The color's warmer.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.066
Before it was like a green. Wow!

26:50.317 --> 26:51.693
This looks amazing.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.154
And this is...?

26:54.237 --> 26:57.365
Staghorn ferns. You only have to mist them
once a week.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.950
I love it.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.953
Gen's done a whole gang-load more stuff.
Let's keep going.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.208
Wow!

27:08.543 --> 27:11.254
You guys did not miss a beat!
The space works.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.883
It gives it a warm feeling. Books.
It's inviting.

27:14.966 --> 27:18.178
It feels like a lounge. It feels like
a place where people can come

27:18.261 --> 27:19.721
and talk and map out their day.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.223
-A really big selling point for groups.
-I think so.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.726
Wow!

27:27.228 --> 27:29.189
Oh, my good... Look at this!

27:29.314 --> 27:32.233
This... is... beautiful.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.943
This is amazing.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.279
Where did you find this?
This wasn't here before.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.740
You don't have a lot of floor space,
so we built

27:38.823 --> 27:41.159
the storage for the bed
into the bed itself.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.535
Looks like it's been here

27:42.619 --> 27:43.787
-as long as the house.
-Good!

27:44.162 --> 27:45.789
Let me tell you, it looks great.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.375
Everything is so elegantly laid out.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.835
Plants are something
that hotels just don't do.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.922
So you having real, living plants
throughout your space

27:54.005 --> 27:58.176
is a really important detail
that sets you apart in hospitality.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.804
You guys did not miss a beat.
This is a charger.

28:00.887 --> 28:04.224
All the guests ask me for a charger. I'm
always scrambling around looking for one.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.643
Simple details equal bigger dollars...

28:06.726 --> 28:07.769
-Yes.
-...and returns.

28:07.852 --> 28:11.481
You did so much with this space.
This was a cabinet.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.566
This was an empty cabinet
covering some pipes.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.943
We turned it into two cubbies,

28:15.026 --> 28:18.321
where you have slippers, any other
amenities you want to put in there.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.865
We laid books in there to give you
some filler.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.910
These details are things I'd never
have thought of. Amazing job.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.745
My word for the day is "hot."

28:25.829 --> 28:29.124
It keeps getting hotter,
so this right now, it's on fire!

28:29.457 --> 28:31.084
-There's so much more.
-There's more?

28:31.167 --> 28:32.293
Much more. Let's go.

28:32.669 --> 28:36.214
This house is not the same house
that I left. It's like a brand-new house.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.966
It's beyond my expectations.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.844
So, your guests are here.
Their bags are in their rooms.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.596
It's breakfast. I just woke up.
What do I do?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.348
-Oh!
-Oh, the bagels!

28:45.432 --> 28:48.601
Maybe I'll go have one of Gordy's bagels.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.104
Do you remember that we saw Scot
at the bagel store?

28:51.187 --> 28:52.939
-I do.
-And we did the rainbow bagel?

28:53.022 --> 28:55.316
-Yes.
-Well, he has now created

28:55.400 --> 28:57.402
the Yellow Block bagel.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.404
-This is hot!
-This is unique.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.198
-This is...
-This is the only place you can get these.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.199
Amazing!

29:03.283 --> 29:05.660
-Who gets a bagel named after them?
-You got one!

29:05.744 --> 29:08.413
I am humbled to have a Yellow Block bagel.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.039
It carves out a unique space.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.251
There are 98 other short-term rentals
that are your competition.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.712
-Your heart's pounding!
-They don't have a bagel!

29:15.795 --> 29:17.130
They don't have a bagel.

29:17.213 --> 29:20.508
They don't have this, and they don't have
unique guest experience,

29:20.592 --> 29:23.511
which is what Gen and I wanted to create
this week for you.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.432
We've got professional photographs now.
You've got the best design

29:27.515 --> 29:29.809
-this place could possibly have.
-Definitely.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.729
You now have a foolproof
business plan, right?

29:32.812 --> 29:37.484
So you can rise above everyone else.
You are the mayor of the Yellow Block B&amp;B.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.278
-Yes.
-We can up your occupancy.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.031
So you can put the kids through college,
like we spoke about.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.283
Yes. I'm so humble. This is amazing.

29:45.366 --> 29:48.745
Just increasing your  occupancy
from 13 to 20 nights a month

29:48.828 --> 29:52.207
means your bottom line is improved
by $72,000 a year.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.126
You guys have done it.
I was getting a F when we started.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.670
Now I feel like I'm getting...
I'm on my way.

29:57.754 --> 30:01.382
What Genevieve and Peter really,
really did was give me a blueprint.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.759
They've given me a road map.

30:02.842 --> 30:06.387
They came in and pointed some things out.
They put some fresh eyes on it.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.056
They came with some excellent ideas

30:08.139 --> 30:10.683
that I can use to help
better develop this property.

30:11.142 --> 30:15.063
The Yellow Block bagel, just for you guys.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.690
So this is your bagel.
No one else has this.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.151
-Did they specially make this?
-Yeah. They make it for you.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.153
Wow! We are forever grateful.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.155
How do you guys feel? What do you think?

30:24.239 --> 30:25.824
I really like this. Thank you.

30:25.907 --> 30:26.908
-Alright.
-Hey.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.035
Thank you for being such a great family.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.120
Big hugs!

30:32.205 --> 30:35.166
Now we need to go live
and launch the new property listing.

30:37.710 --> 30:41.464
The quintessential Brooklyn
brownstone experience awaits

30:41.548 --> 30:43.216
with the Yellow Block B&amp;B.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.468
Steps from the Biggie Smalls mural,

30:45.552 --> 30:50.557
the Yellow Block B&amp;B
is head and shoulders above all others

30:50.640 --> 30:54.269
when it comes to quality accommodation
for large groups

30:54.352 --> 30:56.563
visiting the Big Apple.
