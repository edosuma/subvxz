00:00.633 --> 00:03.069
Danni, this is Quincy.

00:03.069 --> 00:05.071
He's going to be
taking Zac's space.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.407
[Female Announcer]
Previously on "Sistas"...

00:07.407 --> 00:10.110
What is up with y'all?
Okay, then, all right!

00:10.110 --> 00:11.411
Well, you look better.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.279
I'm telling you, I feel fine,

00:13.279 --> 00:15.348
but my mama won't
let me do nothing.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.984
[Lisa]<i> Need you to be here
at Karen's at 8 o'clock.</i>

00:17.984 --> 00:19.285
Wait, what?

00:19.285 --> 00:21.888
-They coming?
-Yep, Zac, Aaron.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.356
Okay.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.657
You know I got a
restraining order, right?

00:24.657 --> 00:26.493
Hayden, you might want to
check that and be sure.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.327
What you mean?

00:27.327 --> 00:28.595
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.662
I'ma remember this shit.

00:36.239 --> 00:37.940
You look worried.

00:37.940 --> 00:39.308
Get lost.

00:39.308 --> 00:40.877
I can see it
all over your face.

00:40.877 --> 00:43.246
I'm not going to say
it again. Go away.

00:43.246 --> 00:46.683
I can tell you what they're
talking about if you want.

00:46.683 --> 00:48.518
I don't care
what they're talking about.

00:48.518 --> 00:52.321
No? Well, you should.
It's about business.

00:52.321 --> 00:54.057
I assumed that much was true.

00:54.057 --> 00:58.194
Hmm. The question is,
how long it's going to take

00:58.194 --> 01:00.063
before they start
talking about you?

01:01.030 --> 01:02.999
Did you set this up?

01:02.999 --> 01:04.934
Maybe.

01:04.934 --> 01:07.103
Hayden, what did you do?

01:07.103 --> 01:09.539
I have a client
who's looking for a hedge fund,

01:09.539 --> 01:12.108
so naturally,
I thought of Gary,

01:12.108 --> 01:16.379
but I recommended he should meet
Gary and the boss of the firm

01:16.379 --> 01:18.581
to have their best
interest at heart.

01:18.581 --> 01:20.583
-Hayden.
-What's that?

01:21.818 --> 01:25.021
Something really bad
is going to happen to you.

01:25.021 --> 01:26.622
-Really?
-Yes.

01:26.622 --> 01:28.925
So Zac beating my ass
up and down those stairs,

01:28.925 --> 01:30.593
that wasn't bad? No?

01:30.593 --> 01:31.994
I can do much worse.

01:31.994 --> 01:33.196
-Really?
-Yes.

01:33.196 --> 01:34.397
What about what Fatima did?

01:34.397 --> 01:36.132
That wasn't bad either?

01:37.066 --> 01:38.601
I can do it legally.

01:38.601 --> 01:40.436
-Legally?
-Mm-hmm.

01:40.436 --> 01:42.271
That's a nice
little caveat you added there.

01:42.271 --> 01:45.274
Is that a threat? Are you
threatening me right now, Andi?

01:45.274 --> 01:47.043
It's a promise, Hayden.

01:48.578 --> 01:51.948
I forgot. You like
to hide your hood rat, huh?

01:51.948 --> 01:53.116
I got your hood rat.

01:53.116 --> 01:55.251
I bet you do.

01:55.251 --> 01:57.787
You are a raggedy
little bitch-man.

01:57.787 --> 01:59.355
Thank you.

01:59.355 --> 02:00.590
Having Gary sue me?

02:00.590 --> 02:03.659
Well, I tried,
but he backed out

02:03.659 --> 02:06.496
because apparently,
y'all hooked up, huh?

02:08.698 --> 02:10.900
-Did he tell you that?
-Oh, absolutely.

02:12.535 --> 02:15.338
Well, maybe if someone
was hooking up with you,

02:15.338 --> 02:19.075
you wouldn't be such a
miserable, insecure little man.

02:19.075 --> 02:22.879
Right. I knew you were
going to hook up with him.

02:22.879 --> 02:24.781
You don't know shit about me.

02:24.781 --> 02:27.483
Really? Well, I knew
you didn't want to get sued.

02:28.518 --> 02:30.153
See, Gary,

02:30.153 --> 02:33.523
he's too stupid to realize
you out here playing him.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.761
Aw. You wish you were
getting played, hon?

02:39.529 --> 02:41.063
After this meeting,

02:41.063 --> 02:44.000
I'ma make sure he knows
how bad you playing him.

02:44.734 --> 02:46.936
-Go to hell, Hayden.
-Mm-hmm.

03:08.776 --> 03:10.677
Why are you still
standing here?

03:15.182 --> 03:17.418
Good luck, Andi.

03:17.418 --> 03:19.153
Why are you talking to him?

03:23.490 --> 03:25.426
He set up this meeting.

03:27.094 --> 03:28.529
Really?

03:28.529 --> 03:31.999
I don't know
why he's doing this.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.467
Yeah.

03:33.467 --> 03:36.503
And you were mad at me laughing
about him possibly being dead?

03:36.503 --> 03:38.972
Okay, that's still
not funny, but...

03:38.972 --> 03:41.408
That -- a gnat.
Just be like...

03:41.408 --> 03:43.410
Want to smack the shit
out of him.

03:44.111 --> 03:45.446
He is.

03:45.446 --> 03:47.815
Okay, but what
are they talking about?

03:47.815 --> 03:49.516
Apparently,
Hayden represents

03:49.516 --> 03:53.220
someone who wanted
to meet with Gary,

03:53.220 --> 03:55.722
and then they suggested
that they meet with Robin.

03:55.722 --> 03:59.493
Wait. Wasn't Robin
supposed to be in London?

03:59.493 --> 04:00.828
Exactly.

04:00.828 --> 04:02.863
How did he even know
he was here?

04:02.863 --> 04:03.964
Exactly.

04:03.964 --> 04:06.900
Mm-hmm.
Little -- is a rat too.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.536
But I need to talk to him.

04:09.536 --> 04:11.472
I bet you do.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.974
About something else, Fatima.

04:15.042 --> 04:17.811
Oh, okay. Well,
anything I can help you with?

04:17.811 --> 04:22.049
No. Just, I want
this meeting to be over.

04:22.049 --> 04:24.218
I need to talk to him.

04:24.218 --> 04:26.520
Okay.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.222
Are you okay?

04:28.222 --> 04:29.823
Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

04:29.823 --> 04:31.692
I saw Zac here earlier.

04:33.126 --> 04:35.729
Yeah. About that,

04:36.864 --> 04:38.932
He's going to talk
to Karen tonight.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.268
What?

04:41.268 --> 04:42.903
Yeah.

04:43.971 --> 04:46.039
Karen is not supposed
to be stressed out right now.

04:46.039 --> 04:47.307
It's very important.

04:47.307 --> 04:48.709
Well, apparently,

04:48.709 --> 04:50.844
her mom invited him
and Aaron over there.

04:52.479 --> 04:54.848
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

04:54.848 --> 04:57.017
Well, Lisa did it?
That's good then.

04:58.452 --> 04:59.720
Is it?

04:59.720 --> 05:01.588
Oh, yeah. Lisa don't play.

05:02.723 --> 05:05.259
Hmm.
That's exactly what Zac said.

05:05.259 --> 05:07.127
Mm-hmm. But she is always fair.

05:08.228 --> 05:09.696
Is she, Andi?

05:09.696 --> 05:11.732
Yes, it's going to be great.

05:11.732 --> 05:14.301
She's going to offer
a different perspective and...

05:14.301 --> 05:16.970
This is going to straighten
them out. Trust me.

05:16.970 --> 05:19.306
Okay.

05:19.306 --> 05:21.942
Fatima, you don't need to worry.

05:23.277 --> 05:27.114
That boy is obsessed with you.
I love the way he looks at you.

05:28.315 --> 05:29.883
I know. I know.

05:29.883 --> 05:31.952
You don't have nothing
to worry about. Okay?

05:31.952 --> 05:37.391
Okay.
They also invited me over there.

05:37.391 --> 05:38.759
Oh, no, ma'am. Mm-mm.

05:38.759 --> 05:40.294
I do not agree with that.
I disagree.

05:40.294 --> 05:41.728
-Right. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-mm.

05:41.728 --> 05:42.930
-Right.
-No. That's a bad idea.

05:42.930 --> 05:44.398
Forget everything I just said.

05:44.398 --> 05:45.832
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-It was terrible.

05:45.832 --> 05:49.603
Mm-hmm.
That's what I said. Yeah.

05:49.603 --> 05:50.837
Wait, wait, wait.

05:50.837 --> 05:53.907
They invited you,
knowing that Karen

05:53.907 --> 05:55.809
is not supposed to be
stressed out right now?

05:55.809 --> 05:57.411
Exactly. That's what Zac said.

05:57.411 --> 05:59.146
I was like, "What?"

06:00.914 --> 06:02.983
I don't think you should go.

06:02.983 --> 06:04.885
Honey, I have
no intentions on going.

06:04.885 --> 06:05.886
Oh, good.

06:05.886 --> 06:09.289
Yeah. This shit right here?

06:10.324 --> 06:15.429
And that --, I just...
He just pisses me off.

06:15.429 --> 06:17.030
No. Don't worry about Hayden.

06:17.030 --> 06:21.768
It's... I'm going to take
care of it somehow.

06:21.768 --> 06:23.003
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:23.003 --> 06:24.605
Well, you better before I do.

06:24.605 --> 06:26.139
Don't...

06:26.139 --> 06:28.075
You don't take care of it.
Let me just...

06:28.075 --> 06:29.276
Got it.

06:29.276 --> 06:30.811
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:30.811 --> 06:34.514
All right. Come on.
Let's go back to work.

06:34.514 --> 06:35.682
All right.

06:35.682 --> 06:39.486
So, this will be great.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.887
Thank you very much
for coming in.

06:40.887 --> 06:44.024
We appreciate it.
Hayden, come in, please.

06:44.024 --> 06:45.258
-Hey.
-Hi.

06:45.258 --> 06:46.760
How did it go?

06:46.760 --> 06:48.195
Oh, I think Mr. Morris
will be very happy here.

06:48.195 --> 06:50.797
-[Mr. Morris] Yes.
-That is fantastic.

06:50.797 --> 06:52.332
Come on, guys.
I'll walk you down to your car.

06:52.332 --> 06:53.567
So, we'll be seeing you.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.735
-Me too.
-All right.

06:54.735 --> 06:56.103
Thank you. Thank you.

06:56.103 --> 06:57.471
I told you these guys
were great. Right?

06:57.471 --> 06:59.106
Perfect. Perfect.

06:59.106 --> 07:00.641
Thank you. Thank you.
I'll see you guys. All right?

07:00.641 --> 07:02.209
[Mr. Morris] All right.

07:13.820 --> 07:17.691
So, looks like we're
going to be working together.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.160
Looks that way.

07:24.831 --> 07:26.099
Can I talk to you
for a second?

07:26.099 --> 07:28.135
I kind of figured
that was coming.

07:29.236 --> 07:32.305
Yeah, I think you know
what it's about.

07:33.573 --> 07:35.308
Andi.

07:36.877 --> 07:38.278
Yeah, have a seat, Robin.

07:38.278 --> 07:39.913
No, I'll stand.

07:40.881 --> 07:43.216
What, you want to show me
how tall you are?

07:44.451 --> 07:46.153
Excuse me?

07:47.287 --> 07:48.989
Nothing.

07:49.956 --> 07:51.925
What do you want to talk about?

07:55.362 --> 07:57.097
I know all about you.

07:58.598 --> 08:00.300
Okay.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.436
And I know
that you had sex with her.

08:03.904 --> 08:06.373
You going to say something?

08:08.141 --> 08:10.377
You wanted to talk.
I'm here to listen.

08:12.079 --> 08:17.384
Okay, well, look.
I love her, and she loves me.

08:17.384 --> 08:19.152
Is that so?

08:21.888 --> 08:23.323
Don't do that.

08:23.323 --> 08:24.991
What?

08:24.991 --> 08:28.261
Look. See I know that she
works here, and you're her boss.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.966
I would just hate for you to...

08:34.401 --> 08:36.136
To what?

08:37.571 --> 08:39.206
Okay, Robin, I know her.
All right?

08:39.206 --> 08:43.543
And, she'll be interested
in something for a while.

08:43.543 --> 08:45.011
Oh, like you.

08:45.011 --> 08:49.349
But, it will change.
No, my friend. Like you.

08:52.219 --> 08:53.720
I see.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.921
So, I would appreciate it

08:54.921 --> 08:57.691
if you would respect
the boundaries.

08:57.691 --> 09:00.460
I don't see a ring
on her finger.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.496
Rings represent boundaries.

09:05.432 --> 09:07.367
It'll be back on soon.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.102
Yeah, well, until then...

09:11.471 --> 09:12.672
So, you're this dude?

09:12.672 --> 09:14.407
What dude is that?

09:15.575 --> 09:18.378
I see you. Oh, yeah.

09:20.547 --> 09:21.748
Hey, Gary.

09:21.748 --> 09:23.316
What?

09:23.316 --> 09:24.851
I think that as long as
we're doing business

09:24.851 --> 09:27.087
with this client,

09:27.087 --> 09:29.723
it's best if we let everything
go through Hayden.

09:29.723 --> 09:31.191
I definitely agree.

09:31.191 --> 09:34.127
Oh, wonderful.
We have an understanding.

09:35.829 --> 09:40.066
I really, really hope we do.

09:41.234 --> 09:42.769
Wouldn't be wise
to threaten me.

09:42.769 --> 09:45.472
Oh, wouldn't be... Okay.

09:47.407 --> 09:53.013
I got you. "Wouldn't be wise."
I got you, bro.

09:53.013 --> 09:54.948
There's the door.

09:56.349 --> 09:57.617
I'm leaving.

09:57.617 --> 09:59.986
Yeah, you have a great day.

09:59.986 --> 10:02.255
No, I want you
to have a better one.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.369
[phone ringing]

10:16.369 --> 10:17.704
Danni.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.372
Hey, I couldn't
get to the phone.

10:19.372 --> 10:22.175
It's okay. I still
haven't heard anything.

10:22.175 --> 10:23.844
Andi, this is some bullshit.

10:23.844 --> 10:25.545
I know.

10:25.545 --> 10:27.581
Isn't she supposed to
get a phone call or something?

10:27.581 --> 10:29.015
Exactly.

10:29.015 --> 10:31.785
All right.
Well, have you talked to Robin?

10:31.785 --> 10:33.420
He's still in a meeting.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.355
Hey. Hey, hey.
Are you hearing me?

10:35.355 --> 10:36.790
Sabrina is in jail.
Go in there.

10:36.790 --> 10:37.924
You think I don't know that?

10:37.924 --> 10:39.359
Do I have to remind you?

10:39.359 --> 10:41.928
She's not a hood chick.
She can't do jail.

10:41.928 --> 10:45.165
Danni! Danni! I know. Okay?
I am working on it.

10:45.165 --> 10:46.933
All right.
I'm just going to go down there.

10:46.933 --> 10:48.368
I'm going to go down there.

10:48.368 --> 10:49.469
And do what?

10:49.469 --> 10:51.238
I don't know, Andi.

10:51.238 --> 10:53.006
I just want her to know that
we're here, and we're trying.

10:53.006 --> 10:54.875
Okay. You do whatever.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.777
Oh, wait. Looks like Robin is
available. Call you back, okay?

10:57.777 --> 10:58.945
Okay. Right back.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.881
Okay. I'll call you.

11:03.008 --> 11:05.177
So, what does this line mean?

11:09.381 --> 11:10.649
Don't worry about it.

11:10.649 --> 11:12.251
But what does it mean?

11:12.251 --> 11:15.120
It's asking you
if you were trained in CPR.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.122
Oh, you mean to like,
resuscitate somebody?

11:17.122 --> 11:20.993
-Exactly like that. Yup.
-No, I haven't.

11:20.993 --> 11:22.628
Right. That's why I told you,

11:22.628 --> 11:25.230
"Don't worry about it,"
because they'll train you.

11:26.765 --> 11:29.334
Okay.
So, you've been trained in that?

11:29.334 --> 11:30.869
Yup.

11:30.869 --> 11:33.272
Oh, I see. What else
have you been trained in?

11:36.608 --> 11:38.377
How to spot a scrub.

11:38.377 --> 11:40.312
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.881
You calling me a scrub?

11:42.881 --> 11:45.117
No. No, no, no.
I'm thinking it.

11:45.117 --> 11:48.387
Oh, okay.
Well, you said it.

11:48.387 --> 11:49.922
No, no, no.

11:49.922 --> 11:53.892
I said I've been trained,
and I'm top of my class,

11:54.893 --> 11:59.398
but you are giving me cues with
that nice little ankle jewelry.

11:59.398 --> 12:00.566
Oh, my bad.

12:00.566 --> 12:01.767
Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.502
Yeah.

12:03.502 --> 12:05.437
I don't know how in the hell
some of y'all work here,

12:05.437 --> 12:06.672
ex-cons.

12:06.672 --> 12:08.140
Ain't you a flight risk
or something like that?

12:08.140 --> 12:09.441
Well, there's a program here.

12:09.441 --> 12:10.609
Mm-hmm.

12:10.609 --> 12:11.744
Yeah.

12:11.744 --> 12:12.978
What'd you do?

12:12.978 --> 12:15.314
Nothing major.

12:15.314 --> 12:20.152
So, it's a felony.
All felonies are major.

12:20.152 --> 12:22.020
-You funny.
-I am.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.455
-Yeah.
-You know what else I am?

12:23.455 --> 12:24.790
Huh?

12:24.790 --> 12:25.858
-Working.
-Oh, I see. I see. Okay.

12:25.858 --> 12:27.092
Yeah.

12:27.092 --> 12:29.795
-My bad.
-Mm-hmm.

12:29.795 --> 12:31.597
So, can you bring that
to Herman?

12:31.597 --> 12:34.066
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right.

12:34.066 --> 12:36.101
Yeah, you know
where he went?

12:36.101 --> 12:37.970
Honestly,
he could be anywhere.

12:37.970 --> 12:40.305
He takes breaks like
he doesn't have a job, so...

12:42.407 --> 12:44.977
You're funny. Oh, shit.
My fault. My fault.

12:44.977 --> 12:46.145
Are you...

12:46.145 --> 12:47.579
-Huh?
-Are you high?

12:47.579 --> 12:48.814
-No.
-No?

12:48.814 --> 12:50.048
No.

12:50.048 --> 12:51.683
No, you're high.
I can smell it.

12:53.085 --> 12:55.687
No. They drug test?

12:55.687 --> 12:57.256
Mm-hmm.

12:57.256 --> 12:58.690
Oh, well.

12:58.690 --> 12:59.892
You not going to make it.

12:59.892 --> 13:01.093
Huh?

13:01.093 --> 13:02.427
You not going to make it.

13:02.427 --> 13:04.997
Oh, well, this is not
really my thing.

13:05.964 --> 13:07.633
So, what are you
doing here then?

13:07.633 --> 13:09.001
Why...

13:09.001 --> 13:12.070
Oh, so, this helps me
stay out of jail.

13:13.272 --> 13:15.007
Okay, I can't do this anymore.

13:15.007 --> 13:19.077
Can you stay out of jail
over there? Over there?

13:19.077 --> 13:21.413
Oh, not there.
Might get you back in jail.

13:25.050 --> 13:29.288
You got jokes. All right.
I'll... Okay.

13:36.595 --> 13:38.330
Hi.

13:43.602 --> 13:45.637
Hi.

13:45.637 --> 13:47.072
How are you?

13:47.072 --> 13:50.042
I'm good. How are you?

13:52.044 --> 13:54.112
I'm really good.

13:54.112 --> 13:56.748
Really good? Wow.
Well, that's good.

13:59.051 --> 14:02.387
-You seem surprised.
-How did that go?

14:05.357 --> 14:07.025
It went.

14:08.026 --> 14:09.695
Gary...

14:09.695 --> 14:11.363
Can I see you tonight?

14:13.232 --> 14:16.101
Look, if you're going
to see him, just tell me.

14:17.402 --> 14:21.707
I'm actually dealing with
a much more difficult issue

14:21.707 --> 14:23.275
right now, so...

14:23.275 --> 14:27.145
Okay.
Can I help you with it?

14:27.145 --> 14:30.048
No. He can.

14:33.151 --> 14:35.153
So you are going to
see him later.

14:36.321 --> 14:38.023
Maybe.

14:39.725 --> 14:43.629
Okay, well, can you
give me a call later?

14:43.629 --> 14:45.864
You know I told you
I want to catch up.

14:45.864 --> 14:47.733
Yeah, I could do that.

14:47.733 --> 14:50.736
Yeah. I'll see you later.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.049
What the hell?

15:04.049 --> 15:05.951
I don't know.

15:05.951 --> 15:07.185
Why is he being so nice?

15:07.185 --> 15:08.654
I don't know.

15:08.654 --> 15:13.225
Uh-huh. Yup.
Mm-mm, I don't trust it.

15:13.225 --> 15:14.693
Of course you don't.

15:14.693 --> 15:16.628
Mm-mm.

15:16.628 --> 15:18.363
I need to talk to Robin.

15:18.363 --> 15:20.966
And, he going
to be cool with that?

15:20.966 --> 15:22.734
Apparently he's in a good mood.

15:23.735 --> 15:25.103
All right.

15:25.103 --> 15:27.039
Let me go
while he's in a good mood.

15:27.039 --> 15:28.774
You brave.

15:37.449 --> 15:39.184
Come in.

15:41.053 --> 15:43.588
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:46.058 --> 15:48.193
How are you?

15:48.193 --> 15:49.995
I'm good.

15:49.995 --> 15:54.299
Good.
I thought you were in London.

15:56.168 --> 15:57.736
I had to stop in.

15:57.736 --> 16:01.039
Oh. You didn't call me.

16:01.039 --> 16:02.641
Am I supposed
to call you every time

16:02.641 --> 16:04.309
I come into town?

16:05.777 --> 16:07.145
You're right.

16:07.145 --> 16:10.248
Yeah. What's up?
I got a lot to do.

16:12.551 --> 16:15.787
Well, I needed
some help with a friend.

16:17.456 --> 16:19.191
A friend?

16:20.192 --> 16:22.694
Yes.
She may have gotten arrested,

16:22.694 --> 16:25.030
and I can't make any headway
on it, so...

16:25.030 --> 16:27.132
I see.

16:27.132 --> 16:29.201
So, I was wondering
if you could maybe...

16:29.201 --> 16:31.737
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:31.737 --> 16:33.238
Yeah?

16:33.238 --> 16:35.140
You ask for a lot
of favors, don't you?

16:37.075 --> 16:39.478
Excuse me?

16:39.478 --> 16:43.148
You asked for help
with Fatima and then Zac

16:44.750 --> 16:50.222
and now this friend.
What'd she do?

16:51.423 --> 16:53.225
Well, she didn't do anything.

16:53.225 --> 16:55.394
Well, she had to do
something to get arrested.

16:56.528 --> 16:58.764
Well, I was getting to that.

16:58.764 --> 17:01.400
Apparently there's a witness
that says

17:01.400 --> 17:04.703
that she was a part of a robbery
that was at her bank, but...

17:07.839 --> 17:10.275
Wow.

17:10.275 --> 17:12.177
Wow? Wow what?

17:12.944 --> 17:16.281
I had you all wrong.

17:19.918 --> 17:21.119
Excuse me?

17:21.119 --> 17:23.355
I thought you were
this good girl

17:23.355 --> 17:27.626
that you know, just liked
to have a good time.

17:29.895 --> 17:32.898
I also thought you were into
a certain quality of men.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.069
I'm not entirely sure

17:37.069 --> 17:38.703
what you're getting
at right now.

17:41.006 --> 17:46.311
Someone told me that you
had sex with a janitor here.

17:49.915 --> 17:51.583
Paris or something.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.421
And who would tell you that?

17:58.290 --> 17:59.925
You know you have a reputation,
Andi,

17:59.925 --> 18:01.827
and to be honest with you,
I'm a little bit embarrassed

18:01.827 --> 18:04.062
that I didn't know
about it before we...

18:04.062 --> 18:05.797
Are you serious right now?

18:07.666 --> 18:11.203
Yeah, I'm serious.
And, I want us to be good,

18:11.203 --> 18:13.472
so is there anything
you want to tell me?

18:14.840 --> 18:16.808
Such as?

18:16.808 --> 18:18.276
Well, shit,

18:18.276 --> 18:19.845
it's a little late
to ask now, isn't it?

18:19.845 --> 18:23.482
But, do you have any
sexually transmitted diseases?

18:30.088 --> 18:31.590
No, I don't.

18:31.590 --> 18:33.525
Okay. When's the last
time you checked?

18:34.359 --> 18:36.328
I get an exam twice a year.

18:36.328 --> 18:38.263
That's not a time.

18:40.565 --> 18:43.835
Three months ago
at my bi-annual exam.

18:45.871 --> 18:47.606
All right. Great.

18:49.808 --> 18:52.110
Well, is there anything
you want to tell me?

18:53.111 --> 18:57.349
No, not at all.
I know my status on everything.

18:59.851 --> 19:01.453
And?

19:01.453 --> 19:03.588
What do you mean, and?
I don't have anything.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.692
Well, neither do I.

19:07.692 --> 19:09.060
Okay, great.

19:09.060 --> 19:12.364
I'm not going to be able
to help you with your friend.

19:13.932 --> 19:17.869
Well, thank you anyway.

19:24.442 --> 19:28.446
Hey, Andi. Come here. Come here.

19:32.217 --> 19:36.621
I was looking
at your last case files,

19:38.323 --> 19:40.025
that Duncan file was a mess.

19:41.326 --> 19:43.628
You should have worked harder
on that one.

19:46.798 --> 19:47.966
Okay. I got you.

19:47.966 --> 19:49.801
I'm sorry. What was that?

19:51.336 --> 19:53.738
I will do better at my job.

19:53.738 --> 19:57.742
Okay, good. And in the future,

19:58.843 --> 20:00.612
when you want to just
come in like this,

20:00.612 --> 20:03.415
why don't you schedule it
with my secretary, please.

20:05.884 --> 20:07.552
Yes, sir.

20:07.552 --> 20:09.721
Great.
Close the door on your way out.

20:14.926 --> 20:16.828
Did you not hear me?

20:16.828 --> 20:19.965
Yes, sir.
I heard you loud and clear.

20:33.155 --> 20:34.623
Man.

20:34.623 --> 20:36.291
-Right?
-He ain't got no idea.

20:36.291 --> 20:37.526
No, he has no idea.

20:37.526 --> 20:39.061
Ooh, shit!

20:39.061 --> 20:40.495
Hayden.

20:40.495 --> 20:41.697
-Huh?
-Don't get too arrogant.

20:41.697 --> 20:43.332
No, you right. You right.

20:43.332 --> 20:45.267
All right? Because we
going to bankrupt that ass.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.902
I can't wait. You saw
how leveraged he is, right?

20:46.902 --> 20:48.637
Oh, he's so damn stupid.

20:48.637 --> 20:51.006
I've got several companies
ready to bid.

20:51.006 --> 20:52.975
But we got to take it
slow though, right?

20:52.975 --> 20:55.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

20:55.644 --> 20:57.846
So, did you
talk to him about Andi?

20:59.581 --> 21:00.849
Yeah, I talked to him.

21:00.849 --> 21:03.685
Oh, shit. What he say?

21:03.685 --> 21:05.153
Don't worry about it.
I got it.

21:05.153 --> 21:06.388
Okay. I got you.

21:06.388 --> 21:07.556
Yeah.

21:07.556 --> 21:09.024
Did I tell you what I did?

21:09.024 --> 21:10.258
What?

21:10.258 --> 21:11.693
All right.
So, I sent him an e-mail, right?

21:11.693 --> 21:12.761
Mm-hmm.

21:12.761 --> 21:15.731
I told him about Andi and Paris.

21:17.499 --> 21:18.967
What?

21:18.967 --> 21:21.737
Yeah, about the janitor,
how they were sleeping together.

21:23.605 --> 21:24.973
How do you know that?

21:24.973 --> 21:26.475
Bro, you called me
and told me that.

21:26.475 --> 21:27.642
What you talking about?

21:27.642 --> 21:28.844
Hayden,
why would do that?

21:28.844 --> 21:30.545
Now she's gonna think it's me.

21:30.545 --> 21:32.014
Oh.

21:32.014 --> 21:34.216
Think! We had a perfect plan.
What are you doing?

21:34.216 --> 21:36.651
That's my fault. See, I didn't
even think about it like that.

21:36.651 --> 21:38.453
-God damn.
-That's my bad.

21:38.453 --> 21:41.723
So, you really like, you really
want her back then, huh?

21:42.624 --> 21:44.192
Yeah. What are you...

21:44.192 --> 21:46.762
So, you really,
really want her?

21:46.762 --> 21:49.965
-Clearly
-Wow. Damn.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.035
What?

21:53.035 --> 21:54.936
Nothing. Nothing.
I just...

21:54.936 --> 21:58.040
I didn't know that you still
was feeling her like that.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.342
In my mind, I thought
you were trying to hit that ass.

22:00.342 --> 22:01.943
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, watch your mouth.

22:01.943 --> 22:04.379
No, I get it. You feeling her.
I get it. I get it.

22:04.379 --> 22:07.983
Yeah, you still... You want this
man to lose this whole company?

22:07.983 --> 22:09.117
I do.

22:09.117 --> 22:11.887
Okay. Well, this is
all part of the plan.

22:11.887 --> 22:13.889
All right? Because you don't
want him to know...

22:13.889 --> 22:15.090
No, no, no. You right.
You right.

22:15.090 --> 22:16.625
That's my fault. That's my bad.

22:16.625 --> 22:19.361
-All right?
-All right.

22:19.361 --> 22:22.931
So, you going to help me with
this Zac situation, or what?

22:22.931 --> 22:24.499
-The Zac stuff again? Come on.
-Bro.

22:24.499 --> 22:25.734
What is it
with you and Zac?

22:25.734 --> 22:27.502
Bro, I came up
with this plan, right?

22:27.502 --> 22:30.205
And, I brought
the investors.

22:30.205 --> 22:32.140
Look, we need to figure out a
way to get him crossed up

22:32.140 --> 22:35.043
-or something.
-I don't like that, man.

22:35.043 --> 22:36.945
He was calling you
for advice, right?

22:36.945 --> 22:38.713
So you can help me
get his money took.

22:38.713 --> 22:39.915
No, look,
I don't do that, man.

22:39.915 --> 22:41.883
I'm not messing up that brother.

22:41.883 --> 22:43.852
What, so,
Gary got morals now?

22:43.852 --> 22:47.222
Listen, taking over this
law firm, that's business.

22:47.222 --> 22:48.623
All right?
They got a great EBITDA.

22:48.623 --> 22:53.361
I can make that work.
This and this, this is business.

22:53.361 --> 22:58.867
Gary, this is about getting
Robin the -- out the company.

23:00.368 --> 23:01.703
If that happens, great.

23:01.703 --> 23:03.271
Yeah, that would be great.

23:03.271 --> 23:05.207
It would also be great
if my friend

23:05.207 --> 23:07.876
could help me
with the Zac situation.

23:07.876 --> 23:09.377
Okay, I will.

23:09.377 --> 23:11.413
Thank you!
That's not so hard, bro, damn.

23:11.413 --> 23:12.881
On one condition.

23:12.881 --> 23:14.149
Oh, my god.
With the conditions? For real?

23:14.149 --> 23:15.550
What is it about
this Zac guy

23:15.550 --> 23:16.885
that has you all up in arms?

23:16.885 --> 23:20.589
What did...
You acting crazy over this dude.

23:20.589 --> 23:22.090
I'ma keep it real with you.

23:22.090 --> 23:24.726
It's not even about Zac, bro.

23:24.726 --> 23:26.128
Then who is it about?

23:26.128 --> 23:27.696
It's about Fatima
with all that ass.

23:27.696 --> 23:31.066
-What you think?
-Okay. What about Fatima?

23:32.934 --> 23:35.604
Look, we went out, right?

23:35.604 --> 23:38.640
And, she's hitting me up,
pressing me. You know how it go.

23:38.640 --> 23:42.043
And, I kind of was like, "Nah."
But now, I don't know.

23:42.043 --> 23:43.745
I kind of want
to go out with her.

23:43.745 --> 23:46.314
Okay. So, Fatima,
the woman that I saw...

23:46.314 --> 23:47.649
Yeah.

23:47.649 --> 23:49.050
...was all over you,
pressing you?

23:49.050 --> 23:50.252
Oh, you already know.
Absolutely.

23:50.252 --> 23:51.453
Because you got
[Indistinct]

23:51.453 --> 23:52.587
You know how...

23:52.587 --> 23:54.055
So, y'all dated?

23:54.055 --> 23:56.925
It was one date. But, to me,
that's something, bro.

23:56.925 --> 23:58.560
Come on, now. You asking
all kinds of questions.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.396
The details don't matter.
Can you help me out or not?

24:01.396 --> 24:02.998
Listen, Hayden.
I'm not doing that. All right?

24:02.998 --> 24:04.499
-Where the hell is the elevator?
-Bro.

24:04.499 --> 24:06.067
-We'll talk.
-You had me tell you all that,

24:06.067 --> 24:08.003
-and you ain't going to help me?
-Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

24:08.003 --> 24:09.104
I'm going to help you,
we'll talk.

24:09.104 --> 24:10.472
-Bro.
-Yeah, for sure.

24:10.472 --> 24:11.273
Yeah, it's done. It's done.

24:15.377 --> 24:17.712
Okay.

24:17.712 --> 24:18.914
Mama.

24:18.914 --> 24:20.882
How'd it go?

24:20.882 --> 24:22.851
I finished.

24:22.851 --> 24:24.586
Good for you, baby girl.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.422
It was hard.

24:27.422 --> 24:31.092
I knew it would be.
You feel good about it?

24:32.661 --> 24:34.829
As good as I can feel.

24:34.829 --> 24:36.831
Okay.

24:36.831 --> 24:39.134
You sure about this?

24:40.635 --> 24:42.370
I know it's hard,
but trust me.

24:44.206 --> 24:45.907
Okay.

24:45.907 --> 24:47.642
Are you hungry?
Want to eat something?

24:47.642 --> 24:49.945
No, I'm good.

24:49.945 --> 24:51.880
You nervous?

24:53.548 --> 24:55.250
Yes.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.586
Okay.

24:57.586 --> 24:59.321
Is he bringing her?

25:00.422 --> 25:02.023
I don't know, baby,

25:02.023 --> 25:06.494
but either way, it's going
to be all right.

25:06.494 --> 25:07.829
Okay.

25:07.829 --> 25:11.333
So, I want
to show you something.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.068
What?

25:13.068 --> 25:15.637
I don't think you've seen
these. Take a look at that.

25:21.576 --> 25:22.777
Mama.

25:22.777 --> 25:25.180
So, as beautiful
as you are now,

25:25.180 --> 25:27.382
do you see how beautiful
you were then?

25:29.251 --> 25:30.852
Yeah.

25:30.852 --> 25:32.254
And what's going on
inside of you

25:32.254 --> 25:34.189
is just as beautiful,
baby girl.

25:35.290 --> 25:39.060
Something that is this
miraculous and this beautiful,

25:40.629 --> 25:45.900
no man, I mean, no man is worth
messing that up.

25:48.503 --> 25:49.537
You got that?

25:56.278 --> 25:58.413
I just hope I can handle it.

25:58.413 --> 26:02.651
I mean, I hope that I can be
as good as a mother as you.

26:02.651 --> 26:06.855
Oh, baby. Please be better.

26:06.855 --> 26:10.392
No. What?
Mama, you did it all alone.

26:10.392 --> 26:14.863
Oh, well, I screwed up
a lot of it, too,

26:14.863 --> 26:18.233
but I'm just glad
I'm going to be here

26:18.233 --> 26:21.536
to help screw
that one up next.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.204
[knocking on door]

26:23.204 --> 26:26.474
I'll get it.
Take a breath.

26:26.474 --> 26:28.276
I'm fine.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.317
Here we go.

26:37.886 --> 26:38.953
Hi.

26:38.953 --> 26:41.856
Hey, Lisa. How's it going?

26:41.856 --> 26:44.893
It's going good. Come on in.

26:44.893 --> 26:46.628
Thank you.

26:47.896 --> 26:49.597
Hey, Karen.

26:49.597 --> 26:50.832
Hi.

26:50.832 --> 26:53.034
I know I'm a little early.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.969
It's okay.

26:56.671 --> 26:58.139
Well, can I have a hug?

26:58.139 --> 27:00.608
Oh, yeah, of course.

27:03.912 --> 27:05.113
You okay?

27:05.113 --> 27:07.349
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

27:08.550 --> 27:10.285
What you been doing?

27:10.285 --> 27:16.191
Just resting
and writing this letter...

27:17.092 --> 27:21.096
letters to you and Zac.

27:21.096 --> 27:26.034
I don't know why
I feel a little nervous.

27:26.768 --> 27:28.436
Well, you ain't the only one.

27:29.237 --> 27:30.472
Well, yeah, but I'm here,

27:30.472 --> 27:32.874
so everything is going
to be just fine.

27:32.874 --> 27:36.878
I'm going to have a drink.
Want one?

27:36.878 --> 27:38.246
No, Mama, he doesn't.

27:38.246 --> 27:39.748
Oh, that's right. Sorry.

27:39.748 --> 27:42.250
Totally forgot.
It's that preacher thing, right?

27:42.250 --> 27:43.651
Something like that.

27:43.651 --> 27:45.186
Well, explain this to me.

27:45.186 --> 27:48.022
You can have sex,
but you don't drink alcohol?

27:48.022 --> 27:49.324
I'm sorry?

27:49.324 --> 27:50.859
Was that in the Bible?

27:50.859 --> 27:52.093
Mama, stop.

27:52.093 --> 27:53.495
Okay. I'm sorry.

27:53.495 --> 27:54.729
Sorry to...

27:54.729 --> 27:56.531
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

27:56.531 --> 27:59.033
But, you know what, baby?
You're fabulous.

27:59.033 --> 28:00.502
You really know to pick them.

28:00.502 --> 28:02.036
Mama, stop.

28:02.036 --> 28:04.639
The accountant!
He is so sexy. Look at him.

28:04.639 --> 28:05.840
-Stop.
-Oh, honey.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.575
Will you stop?

28:07.575 --> 28:09.444
What? It's not like we're
in competition or anything?

28:09.444 --> 28:10.645
Oh, my god.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.147
Baby, you know
he's way too old for me.

28:12.147 --> 28:13.248
She didn't mean that.

28:13.248 --> 28:14.616
What?
He's at least 35, right?

28:14.616 --> 28:15.784
She don't mean that.

28:15.784 --> 28:17.018
Thirty-two is my threshold,

28:17.018 --> 28:19.154
so I'll be right back.

28:19.154 --> 28:21.055
Please don't drink.

28:22.424 --> 28:24.226
Okay, well,
this is the last of it.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.595
Thank you.

28:26.595 --> 28:29.031
Yeah.
If you don't need anything else,

28:29.031 --> 28:30.866
I'm going to go ahead
and get out of here.

28:30.866 --> 28:32.734
Okay.

28:32.734 --> 28:36.138
Okay. I'm having
some family and friends over

28:36.138 --> 28:38.040
if you want to come by.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.808
Nope. I'm good. Thank you.

28:41.910 --> 28:43.645
Andi, what's going on?

28:45.681 --> 28:47.416
Sabrina is in jail.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.485
I'm sorry. What?

28:51.820 --> 28:53.555
Yup.

28:54.923 --> 28:58.760
And I can't get any help
from anybody on any information.

29:01.263 --> 29:03.165
Shit, Andi. What happened?

29:04.266 --> 29:07.803
Apparently there's
a witness that says

29:07.803 --> 29:11.340
that she was involved
in a robbery at her bank.

29:12.507 --> 29:14.009
Wait a minute.

29:14.009 --> 29:16.745
Sabrina?
You got to be kidding me, right?

29:18.680 --> 29:20.382
I wish.

29:22.617 --> 29:23.852
Would she?

29:23.852 --> 29:25.554
Never.

29:26.455 --> 29:28.724
Okay, well,
is Robin going to help?

29:32.527 --> 29:34.262
No.

29:35.097 --> 29:37.332
Why not?

29:39.034 --> 29:41.136
Andi.

29:42.237 --> 29:45.240
What's going on?

29:48.377 --> 29:50.278
He just disrespected me.

29:52.581 --> 29:56.585
He was so nasty
and mean to me just now.

29:57.986 --> 29:59.621
What?

29:59.621 --> 30:02.090
He was...

30:02.090 --> 30:05.727
asking me about
my sexual history

30:05.727 --> 30:09.664
and exams and STDs.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.969
You should have seen the way
he looked at me

30:13.969 --> 30:17.439
like he was disgusted by me.

30:17.439 --> 30:22.944
Andi. What is...
Where is all this coming from?

30:22.944 --> 30:24.212
I don't know.

30:24.212 --> 30:26.314
Someone told him
that I was with Paris,

30:26.314 --> 30:30.152
and now I'm just
trash apparently.

30:32.454 --> 30:35.390
-What?
-I feel awful.

30:39.361 --> 30:41.863
So, no, he's not
going to help me.

30:43.932 --> 30:45.867
Okay.

30:45.867 --> 30:47.569
And I'm wondering if...

30:51.640 --> 30:55.243
Do you think that Gary
told him?

30:58.680 --> 31:01.716
Andi, I wouldn't even
put it past the bastard.

31:01.716 --> 31:02.884
I wouldn't.

31:02.884 --> 31:04.019
No.

31:04.019 --> 31:06.588
Now that I think about it,

31:06.588 --> 31:09.858
that's probably why he walked
around here all happy and shit.

31:16.531 --> 31:18.934
Just come over to my house.

31:20.102 --> 31:23.939
No. No, I have to help Sabrina.

31:23.939 --> 31:26.575
So, where's my phone?

31:27.642 --> 31:31.413
You know what? Andi.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

31:31.413 --> 31:34.382
Andi, I know someone.
Okay?

31:34.382 --> 31:36.518
I have a cousin.
She can help you out.

31:36.518 --> 31:41.089
She knows everybody.
Just trust me on this.

31:41.089 --> 31:42.757
Just come over.

31:42.757 --> 31:44.259
Are you sure?

31:44.259 --> 31:46.862
Yes, I'm sure.
All right? So just come on.

31:49.598 --> 31:51.366
Okay, I trust you.
[phone ringing]

31:51.366 --> 31:53.335
I feel your phone
ringing somewhere.

31:53.335 --> 31:54.503
Where is it? Your phone.

31:54.503 --> 31:57.839
I don't know where any...

31:57.839 --> 31:59.541
It's okay. Calm down.

32:01.610 --> 32:02.844
Danni.

32:02.844 --> 32:04.212
[Danni]<i> Hey.</i>

32:04.212 --> 32:06.815
I couldn't get any help.

32:06.815 --> 32:08.316
What the hell, Andi?

32:08.316 --> 32:09.851
Yeah, I know.
But, I'm here with Fatima,

32:09.851 --> 32:11.953
and she says that she has
someone who can help us.

32:11.953 --> 32:15.724
All right. Well, I can't just go
home and sit on my hands.

32:15.724 --> 32:17.792
I know. I know.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.262
I'm coming
to your house. All right?

32:20.262 --> 32:22.063
-I'm not going to be there.
-[Danni]<i> Why not?</i>

32:22.063 --> 32:24.199
I'm going to be at Fatima's.

32:24.199 --> 32:25.400
Okay.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.935
[Andi]<i> Okay. I'll call you.</i>

32:26.935 --> 32:29.804
All right. Just let me know
as soon as you hear anything.

32:29.804 --> 32:31.439
I'll let you know.

32:31.439 --> 32:33.208
[Danni] Yeah, I'm going get a
drink...

32:33.208 --> 32:34.709
Okay.

32:34.709 --> 32:36.578
...soon as I find
a somebody to pay for it.

32:36.578 --> 32:39.748
Danni, stop this. Okay?

32:39.748 --> 32:41.783
Just call me.

32:41.783 --> 32:43.451
Okay.

32:45.253 --> 32:47.722
She's worried
about Sabrina too, I see.

32:47.722 --> 32:49.925
She's worried sick,
sicker than me.

32:49.925 --> 32:51.560
Come on. Let's go.

32:51.560 --> 32:55.864
Yes. I don't know
where anything is. Let's go.

33:04.039 --> 33:07.709
[phone ringing]

33:07.709 --> 33:08.877
Hey.

33:08.877 --> 33:12.214
Hey, this is Danni
from the airport.

33:12.214 --> 33:14.783
Yeah, hi.

33:14.783 --> 33:16.184
Hi. Yeah, so,

33:16.184 --> 33:20.121
I'm about to get off work,
and I was wondering if...

33:20.121 --> 33:21.323
Say no more.

33:21.323 --> 33:22.958
[Danni] Oh. Okay. You're free?

33:22.958 --> 33:25.260
Yeah, I'm done with work.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.062
[Danni] Oh, okay.

33:27.062 --> 33:29.764
So, where
do you want to meet?

33:29.764 --> 33:33.868
Depends on how
deep your pockets are.

33:33.868 --> 33:35.770
Oh, I'm buying?

33:35.770 --> 33:38.473
You sure in hell
didn't think I was, did you?

33:38.473 --> 33:42.210
No. How about...

33:42.210 --> 33:44.412
The Steam Plant.
I love that place.

33:44.412 --> 33:48.316
[Jonah] Okay, cool.
I'll see you there, say...

33:48.316 --> 33:50.018
Now.

33:50.018 --> 33:53.722
[Jonah] Okay. I'm just going
to home, hop in the shower.

33:53.722 --> 33:56.224
I'll be there...
I'll see you there.

33:56.224 --> 33:57.559
All right.

33:57.559 --> 33:59.227
[Jonah] Thanks for calling me.

33:59.227 --> 34:01.196
Thanks for bringing
your wallet.

34:01.196 --> 34:02.897
Sure thing.

34:22.984 --> 34:24.753
Okay, let's...

34:25.387 --> 34:27.222
This damn girl.

34:27.222 --> 34:29.024
Oh, who is that?

34:29.658 --> 34:31.226
Somebody that's going
to end up in a body bag.

34:31.226 --> 34:32.427
-Hey, neighbor!
-What?

34:32.427 --> 34:33.828
Mm-hmm. Zac's new tenant.

34:33.828 --> 34:35.096
Oh.

34:35.096 --> 34:36.531
Uh-huh. Yeah, that's me.

34:36.531 --> 34:37.932
How's your hand doing?

34:37.932 --> 34:39.401
Oh, it's fine.

34:39.401 --> 34:41.303
It's going to be
your face next time.

34:41.303 --> 34:42.971
What are you showing me?

34:44.005 --> 34:45.707
Girl, you lucky I didn't
press charges

34:45.707 --> 34:48.643
on your crazy ass for that shit.
Okay?

34:48.643 --> 34:50.045
I'm not scared of that.

34:50.045 --> 34:51.179
And I'm a lawyer, so...

34:51.179 --> 34:53.615
Mm-hmm.

34:53.615 --> 34:56.651
What I'm trying
to say is, I'm sorry.

34:56.651 --> 34:58.753
Okay?
I apologize.

34:59.454 --> 35:01.856
I don't need that.
Here.

35:03.058 --> 35:04.592
What's this? A subpoena?

35:04.592 --> 35:07.095
No, if it was,
you'd be grabbing it real quick.

35:07.962 --> 35:10.198
It's a story that I printed off.

35:10.198 --> 35:13.802
-A story?
-Mm-hmm.

35:13.802 --> 35:15.403
You should read it
when you get some time.

35:15.403 --> 35:17.005
-Oh, okay.
-Andi.

35:17.005 --> 35:21.109
Oh, okay. Yep. Coming.

35:24.404 --> 35:26.440
Wow. Well done.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.941
Hey.

35:27.941 --> 35:29.409
What's up?

35:29.409 --> 35:31.044
I thought you would
have been gone by now.

35:31.044 --> 35:33.547
No, I still got some time.
I got about an hour and a half.

35:33.547 --> 35:35.849
Okay, well, don't be late.

35:35.849 --> 35:37.851
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

35:38.886 --> 35:43.157
I'm not doing anything.
Look, you see Andi?

35:43.157 --> 35:44.324
What's up, Andi?

35:44.324 --> 35:45.559
Hey, Zac.

35:45.559 --> 35:46.994
What's going on?

35:46.994 --> 35:48.595
Nothing! Everything.

35:48.595 --> 35:49.963
I wanted her
to come by.

35:49.963 --> 35:51.231
Mm-hmm.

35:51.231 --> 35:52.966
Okay. Why?

35:54.001 --> 35:55.202
We just need to talk.

35:55.202 --> 35:56.436
Yes.

35:56.436 --> 35:58.338
You in the sister circle now?

35:58.338 --> 36:00.541
I'm in the Andi circle
and my circle.

36:00.541 --> 36:03.677
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

36:03.677 --> 36:07.514
-All right. That's enough.
-Okay. That's enough. All right.

36:07.514 --> 36:09.483
Because I could stay
with y'all if y'all had...

36:09.483 --> 36:10.717
-Zac.
-Zac.

36:10.717 --> 36:12.052
All right.
Well, I'ma just go.

36:12.052 --> 36:13.453
-Thank you.
-Okay.

36:13.453 --> 36:14.788
-All right.
-Girl.

36:14.788 --> 36:15.889
Have you seen
my keys, baby?

36:15.889 --> 36:17.257
Because my keys was right here.

36:17.257 --> 36:19.059
Stop playing, Zac.
You know they in your pocket.

36:19.059 --> 36:20.727
Yeah. Bye.

36:20.727 --> 36:21.728
-I love you.
-I love you too.

36:21.728 --> 36:23.630
All right. Enough.

36:23.630 --> 36:25.332
-I love you more.
-Bye. Go.

36:25.332 --> 36:29.036
-I'm takin' off.
-Girl.

36:29.036 --> 36:31.271
[Zac] Hey, though,
real quick, because um...

36:31.271 --> 36:36.410
Zachary Taylor. You see
what I got to deal with?

36:36.410 --> 36:38.712
I do.

36:38.712 --> 36:40.047
You want some wine?

36:40.047 --> 36:42.716
Yes. I mean, no. No.

36:42.716 --> 36:44.618
No, I just need information
on Sabrina.

36:44.618 --> 36:46.420
That is why I cam here.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.755
Okay. All right.
You know what? Hold on.

36:48.755 --> 36:50.891
I need to make
a call real quick.

36:50.891 --> 36:52.593
Okay.

36:54.895 --> 36:58.532
Hey. Okay.
All right. Thank you.

36:58.532 --> 37:03.604
All right. See you soon. Bye.
She's 5 minutes away. All right?

37:03.604 --> 37:04.938
-Okay.
-So it's cool.

37:04.938 --> 37:06.873
And she can help with Sabrina?

37:06.873 --> 37:08.108
Yes.

37:08.108 --> 37:09.309
Okay. Good.

37:09.309 --> 37:10.978
Yes, but...

37:10.978 --> 37:12.379
But what?

37:12.379 --> 37:15.082
Her favors
are kind of expensive,

37:15.082 --> 37:17.718
but I'm blood, so it's all good.
Family discount.

37:17.718 --> 37:19.453
Oh. Expensive?

37:19.453 --> 37:21.955
I mean, money isn't an object
right now, so that's fine.

37:21.955 --> 37:23.390
Okay. Yeah.

37:23.390 --> 37:27.060
It might not be money. She might
call you for a favor or two...

37:27.060 --> 37:29.429
Oh, well, I do favors
all the time. That's fine, too.

37:29.429 --> 37:30.697
...or three. Okay.
Good.

37:30.697 --> 37:33.367
Well, just wait
until you meet her.

37:33.367 --> 37:34.968
Okay.

37:38.538 --> 37:39.773
You sure you don't want none?

37:39.773 --> 37:41.908
You know, I will
take you up on that offer.

37:43.377 --> 37:46.046
I can't imagine what Sabrina
is going through right now.

37:46.046 --> 37:49.316
Girl, I know.
I mean, what even happened?

37:49.316 --> 37:50.817
Okay.

37:50.817 --> 37:54.321
So, her coworker, Maurice,
was dating some loser.

37:54.321 --> 37:55.522
Oh, shit.

37:55.522 --> 37:57.024
Yeah. That's not it.

37:57.024 --> 38:03.063
So, this loser robs Sabrina
and Maurice at the bank,

38:03.063 --> 38:07.968
and then he's, I guess, trying
to pin it on them, the robbery.

38:07.968 --> 38:09.436
And they fell for that shit?

38:09.436 --> 38:13.240
-Yes.
-Wow. Okay.

38:14.474 --> 38:17.811
I'm just thinking about
how Robin treated me, you know?

38:17.811 --> 38:20.280
Andi, that's crazy.
I still can't get over that.

38:21.248 --> 38:22.983
You should have seen it.
It was... he was just...

38:22.983 --> 38:26.386
Hey, you know what?
He is not welcome here.

38:26.386 --> 38:29.856
We're going to focus on Sabrina
and these drinks. Okay?

38:29.856 --> 38:30.924
Yes.

38:30.924 --> 38:32.693
She is at the forefront
of my mind.

38:32.693 --> 38:33.860
Mm-hmm. Right.

38:33.860 --> 38:35.228
And the drinks as well.

38:35.228 --> 38:36.697
So, one thing at a time,

38:36.697 --> 38:38.031
starting with this drink.

38:38.031 --> 38:39.333
And then we'll get
to the other ones.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.467
-Okay.
-Okay?

38:40.467 --> 38:41.735
-Yeah.
-All right.

38:41.735 --> 38:43.003
-That'll be fine.
-Mm-hmm.

38:43.003 --> 38:46.273
-Yeah.
-That is crazy.

38:46.273 --> 38:47.240
I know, right?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.542
[knocking on door]

38:48.542 --> 38:50.477
-You want me to get that?
-[Lisa] No, no. I'll get it.

38:50.477 --> 38:52.612
Stay seated.

38:53.280 --> 38:57.384
You all right?

38:58.385 --> 38:59.619
Hi.

38:59.619 --> 39:01.288
What's up?

39:01.288 --> 39:02.522
How are you?

39:02.522 --> 39:04.191
I'm good.

39:04.191 --> 39:05.359
Hug?

39:05.359 --> 39:06.893
We doing that?

39:06.893 --> 39:08.795
Listen, I ain't know
if you was mad at me or not.

39:08.795 --> 39:11.765
Oh, baby, why would
I be mad at you, huh?

39:11.765 --> 39:13.033
Why? What did you do?

39:13.033 --> 39:14.468
Nothing.
I ain't do nothing.

39:14.468 --> 39:15.969
All right. Well, come on in.

39:16.870 --> 39:21.308
You remember the
accountant-preacher, don't you?

39:21.308 --> 39:22.476
Yeah.

39:22.476 --> 39:23.643
How's it going, man?

39:23.643 --> 39:26.947
What's up? Karen.

39:28.548 --> 39:30.283
Zac.

39:31.084 --> 39:32.452
Is your girlfriend coming?

39:32.452 --> 39:33.987
No.

39:33.987 --> 39:35.555
Oh, man. That's too bad.
I wanted to meet her.

39:35.555 --> 39:37.157
Sorry. Maybe next time.

39:38.158 --> 39:41.728
Okay, well,
before we break bread,

39:41.728 --> 39:44.364
I just want to say
I'm glad you both came,

39:44.364 --> 39:47.901
and let's get down to this shit
because I'm really tired of it.

39:47.901 --> 39:49.503
I want to work it all out.

39:49.503 --> 39:52.706
And, sorry, didn't mean to say
shit in front of you.

39:52.706 --> 39:54.107
I'm just me being me.

39:54.107 --> 39:55.709
Please, by all means, be you.

39:55.709 --> 39:57.577
So let's get the --
going with this,

39:57.577 --> 39:59.946
and grab something to eat.
Get your plates. Come up to...

39:59.946 --> 40:02.649
I'm not hungry,
Ms. Lisa, so...

40:02.649 --> 40:05.919
Zac, just get up there
and get a plate.

40:07.654 --> 40:09.623
Yes, ma'am.

40:09.623 --> 40:11.324
I'll make yours.

40:12.592 --> 40:16.930
Yeah, yeah. Have you met Andi?

40:16.930 --> 40:19.332
-Oh, I have not.
-Hi.

40:19.332 --> 40:21.268
But I been seeing you
around the office.

40:21.268 --> 40:24.004
-Oh, we're hugging. Okay.
-Yes, of course.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.472
I work upstairs
at Lawson and Mills.

40:25.472 --> 40:26.606
Oh, hi.

40:26.606 --> 40:28.008
I been seeing you around.

40:28.008 --> 40:28.975
Oh.

40:30.477 --> 40:32.112

40:32.112 --> 40:34.981
Let me get you

40:34.981 --> 40:36.917
-Oh.

Here you go.

40:41.121 --> 40:43.023
-Thank you so much.
-Mm-hmm.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.392
So, Andi,
y'all got any more openings?

40:46.593 --> 40:48.195
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.430
Look, if anything
opens up, let me know.

40:50.430 --> 40:51.765
I sure will.

40:51.765 --> 40:53.700
Mm-hmm. I work with
a lot of white folks,

40:53.700 --> 40:55.502

41:04.978 --> 41:06.446
Hello.
How are you?

41:06.446 --> 41:07.747
Oh, I'm good.

Oh, it is so good to see you.

41:10.517 --> 41:12.586
You too. You too. Mm.

41:12.586 --> 41:14.821

Next on "Sistas"...

41:29.386 --> 41:30.955
The last time you called me,

41:30.955 --> 41:33.290
you had me beat a -- ass
and throw him on top of a car.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.592
That was you?

41:34.592 --> 41:38.095
And I truly love you,
but I'm not in love with you.

41:38.095 --> 41:40.764
You want to get --
down, then I got you.

41:40.764 --> 41:42.466
--, you better watch
who you talking to.

41:42.466 --> 41:43.567
You know Andi?

41:43.567 --> 41:44.835
Only from here.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.437
You ever taken her out?

41:46.437 --> 41:47.671
No.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.039
Can I see some ID?

41:49.039 --> 41:50.641
Take it out of my pocket.

41:50.641 --> 41:52.643
What kind of woman
do you think I am?

41:52.643 --> 41:53.644
