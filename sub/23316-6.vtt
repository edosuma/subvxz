Any van you see -
search the motherfucker,

00:41.800 --> 00:43.640

00:47.040 --> 00:48.640
You son of a bitch!

00:48.800 --> 00:51.160
Doron, let go of him!

-You son of a bitch!
-Let go of him!

00:53.600 --> 00:55.800
-Doron!
-Moreno!

[You were carrying
a rifle and a gun.]

[Now!]

04:18.880 --> 04:21.320
-Talk to me, Moreno.
-We've tracked the vehicle he was in,

04:21.480 --> 04:23.360
but they managed to transfer him
to another one.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.760
Why didn't you perform
the Hannibal Directive?

04:24.920 --> 04:27.480
We don't do that,
we don't shoot our friends.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.560
What's he doing here?
Didn't he quit?

04:29.720 --> 04:31.880
He's the kidnapee's
brother-in-law.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.720
-What is this, a family visit?
-He's a fighter of mine.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.200
Why didn't you perform
the Hannibal Directive?

04:36.360 --> 04:38.200
If Abu Ahmad finds out
that Boaz killed his brother,

04:38.360 --> 04:39.180
he'll slaughter him.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.400
Gideon, with all due respect,
we need a bargaining chip.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.600
Nurit, who's in Abu Ahmad's
immediate circle?

04:43.760 --> 04:46.960
His brother is dead, so there's
his mother, wife and Sheikh Awdallah.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.720
So let's go to his village,
kidnap his wife and fucking mother--

04:50.880 --> 04:53.640
Doron, Israel is a state of civil law,
not a terrorist organization!

04:53.800 --> 04:56.000
So rise above the law!
Think like an Arab!

04:56.160 --> 04:57.640
-Cool it!
-We either act now,

04:57.800 --> 05:01.760
or ten years from now you'll be releasing
a thousand murderers for his corpse!

05:01.920 --> 05:03.160
Don't touch me!

05:04.040 --> 05:07.840
I won't let Boaz become
another Madhat Yusuf!

05:08.000 --> 05:11.560
-Avihai, Steve, get him outa here. Doron!
-Let go of me!

05:11.720 --> 05:12.920
Enough, Steve.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.880
I apologize.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.760
Give me a cigarette.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.440
-A cigarette?
-Yes, a cigarette.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.760
Is something wrong?

05:53.760 --> 05:55.440
Something terrible happened.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.480
Is it Boaz?

06:02.800 --> 06:05.040
Hamas kidnapped him.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.840
-Who?
-Boaz.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.800
What?

06:13.640 --> 06:15.360
This can't be.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.080
Why do you say something
like that to me?

06:23.600 --> 06:27.320
Why do you come here
to tell me things like that?

06:29.880 --> 06:31.640
Why do you say--

06:41.840 --> 06:45.120
It's your Abu Ahmad, isn't it?

06:46.720 --> 06:48.840
Did your Abu Ahmad do it?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.240
Were you there?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.760
You were supposed
to watch over him!

06:58.920 --> 07:01.840
You were supposed
to watch over him!

07:07.600 --> 07:10.360
He's my little brother.

[-Upon you be peace.]

08:10.600 --> 08:12.280

08:14.160 --> 08:15.960
[-You're in good health.]
[-Praise Allah.]

08:16.120 --> 08:18.400
[May the Lord bless you
and keep you.]

08:20.000 --> 08:22.440
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Hello.]

08:31.080 --> 08:34.400
[-Ask the boy to leave the room.]
[-That boy is the apple of my eye.]

08:34.560 --> 08:37.960
[With all due respect,
ask him to leave.]

08:42.000 --> 08:44.040
[The three of you, please leave.]

08:55.640 --> 08:57.320
[I heard you kidnapped a soldier.]

08:57.480 --> 09:00.640
[-Is that so?]
[-Well, did you or didn't you?]

09:03.680 --> 09:07.320
[Abu Ahmad, why do I need to hear
about our actions over the TV?]

09:07.480 --> 09:10.540
[Had you watched over my brother,
we wouldn't be in this situation.]

09:10.700 --> 09:13.320
[I know the death of your brother
the Shahid has been tough on you,]

09:13.480 --> 09:17.440
[but an action like this could
stop our support from Qatar,]

09:17.880 --> 09:19.720
[from the Authority,]

09:19.880 --> 09:23.800
[and worst of all, it could hinder your
plans for the Al-Buraq bomb attack.]

09:23.960 --> 09:25.520
[Enough!]

09:25.920 --> 09:28.800
[Who are you to teach me
how to run a war?!]

09:28.960 --> 09:29.880
[Ever carry a weapon?]

09:30.040 --> 09:32.400
[Do you know what a bullet
to the stomach feels like?]

09:32.560 --> 09:34.640
[Should we let another unit
carry out the attack?]

09:35.360 --> 09:36.400
[For example?]

09:36.560 --> 09:38.120
[Look who's talking,]

09:38.280 --> 09:41.960
[it's Salahuddin Ayyubi, the man
who sent his widowed sister-in-law]

09:42.120 --> 09:43.400
[-to blow herself up--]
[-Are you insane?]

09:43.560 --> 09:45.040
[Calm down.]

09:45.200 --> 09:47.320
[Pray for the Prophet, my friends.]

09:47.800 --> 09:49.080
[Abu Ahmad,]

09:49.240 --> 09:52.840
[you're Palestine's biggest
and most important fighter.]

09:53.000 --> 09:57.440
[The leadership knows that,
everyone does, it's not a secret.]

09:57.600 --> 10:01.760
[But they'd rather you focused
on planning and executing the attack]

10:01.920 --> 10:04.440
[and that you don't
surprise them again.]

10:04.920 --> 10:06.960
[Sheikh, you know
you're like a father to me.]

10:07.120 --> 10:07.840
[May God keep you.]

10:08.000 --> 10:11.520
[Had you not been in my life since
I was 12, I'd be dead by now.]

10:11.680 --> 10:14.720
[Abu Ahmad, my friend,
thank God for that, not me.]

10:14.880 --> 10:17.200
[-Thank God.]
[-Thank God.]

10:18.240 --> 10:20.760
[I'll return the prisoner to them
out of respect for you, Sheikh.]

10:20.920 --> 10:23.120
[May Allah bless you, Abu Ahmad.]

10:23.720 --> 10:25.360
[May Allah keep you safe.]

10:43.560 --> 10:45.400
[You're a hero.]

10:45.560 --> 10:46.760

[You're a hero.]

10:50.000 --> 10:52.080
[-Where is he?]
[-That's not important.]

10:52.240 --> 10:54.200
[Arrange a safe location,
and we'll give him to you.]

10:54.360 --> 10:57.360
[Alright. Give me 24 hours.]

10:58.640 --> 11:00.000
[You're a hero.]

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
[I think we were quick to rejoice.]

11:24.160 --> 11:26.080
[He says he works
for the Intelligence service.]

11:26.240 --> 11:29.480
[His name is Mohammed Abu Snina,
he's from Surda.]

11:30.560 --> 11:31.920
[Do you believe him?]

11:32.080 --> 11:33.720
[There is an Abu Snina family
in Surda.]

11:33.880 --> 11:37.600
[He could be telling the truth.
But I found this on him.]

11:43.880 --> 11:47.800
[-Has anyone seen or identified him?]
[-Not yet, we're working on it.]

11:47.960 --> 11:49.440
[I'll go see him.]

12:09.480 --> 12:12.240
[-Mohammed?]
[-Yes.]

12:20.840 --> 12:22.800
[Are you from Surda?]

12:25.120 --> 12:27.000
[You're in luck.]

12:27.160 --> 12:29.320
[I've got family in Surda.]

12:31.120 --> 12:34.120
[The Owde family. Know them?
They run a poultry shop.]

12:39.400 --> 12:41.320
[Do you know them or not?]

12:41.480 --> 12:45.440
[There is an Owde family
in Surda, but...]

12:45.880 --> 12:48.280
[...they don't run a poultry shop.]

12:48.520 --> 12:51.000
[They run a candy shop.]

12:54.400 --> 12:57.400
[The best candy
in all of Palestine, huh?]

13:14.840 --> 13:16.280
[What?]

13:20.360 --> 13:22.080
[It can't be.]

13:23.240 --> 13:24.280
[What?]

13:26.160 --> 13:28.280
[Praise Allah.]

13:31.680 --> 13:33.600

my brother Bashir.]

14:03.880 --> 14:05.080
[What are you talking about?]

14:05.240 --> 14:08.240

the pub in Tel Aviv?]

14:13.200 --> 14:14.320
You bastards!

14:14.480 --> 14:17.400
Shoot me,

14:21.480 --> 14:23.080

Leave him alone.]

-Should I call later?
-Actually...

15:37.520 --> 15:39.840
...it's best if you stopped calling.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.040
Let's talk after
this nightmare is over.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.680
I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

[You're the most talented
person I've ever met.]

21:19.440 --> 21:21.500
[The most talented woman.]

21:21.660 --> 21:23.840
[You'll perform the surgery
successfully.]

21:24.080 --> 21:25.480
[No.]

21:28.960 --> 21:32.040
[If you don't do it, I will.]

21:37.080 --> 21:39.080
[What do you want me
to do to him?]

22:00.200 --> 22:01.840
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Hello.]

22:02.000 --> 22:02.920
[How are you?]

22:06.000 --> 22:07.800
[May Allah bless you
for coming here, Sheikh.]

22:07.960 --> 22:10.600
[Is everything alright?
Any trouble with the Jew?]

22:10.760 --> 22:12.720
[No, everything's fine.]

22:15.360 --> 22:20.300
[Keep him safe. In two hours,
Abu Samara's men will come get him.]

22:20.460 --> 22:22.760
[They arranged
a proper location for him.]

22:23.960 --> 22:26.240
[Sheikh, there's been
a change of plan.]

22:37.560 --> 22:40.240
[Sheikh, we're keeping the Jew.]

22:40.400 --> 22:42.760
[You can't do that.]

22:42.920 --> 22:46.280
[Abu Samara will go ballistic.
He already thinks you mistreat him,]

22:46.440 --> 22:48.600
[that you completely ignore him.]

22:48.760 --> 22:51.120
[You'd be declaring war
on Abu Samara.]

22:51.280 --> 22:54.720
[I worry about Abu Samara,
you can't do this to him.]

22:54.880 --> 22:57.200
[Sheikh, that Jew killed
my brother Bashir.]

22:57.400 --> 22:58.200
[What?]

23:02.120 --> 23:04.760
[-That can't be.]
[-He told me.]

23:04.920 --> 23:07.680
[Besides which, he's dying.
He was injured during his capture.]

23:07.840 --> 23:11.480
[In an hour or two he'll be a corpse,
and a corpse is less valuable.]

23:12.280 --> 23:13.320
[What are you up to?]

23:13.480 --> 23:15.560
[Today we're going
to negotiate with the Jews.]

23:17.360 --> 23:20.040
[You can't manage such
negotiations by yourself.]

23:20.200 --> 23:23.080
[What about the movement?
What about Abu Samara?]

23:23.240 --> 23:26.440
[Relax. When prisoners are released,
people come to take photos with them.]

23:26.600 --> 23:29.680
[They'll be happy.
And you'll help me.]

23:31.160 --> 23:33.440
[You've gone mad.]

23:33.600 --> 23:36.920
[I have, and you will help me.
I want you to run the negotiations.]

23:37.080 --> 23:39.560
[The Egyptians will mediate.]

23:41.200 --> 23:44.960
[God chooses
our path for us, not we.]

23:48.760 --> 23:50.840
[You're not the crazy man,]

23:51.040 --> 23:54.560
[I am, for following
in your lead.]

24:20.680 --> 24:22.160
What?

24:24.320 --> 24:28.400
Gideon Avital wants to discuss
a prisoner swap with the Egyptians.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.920
Will it work?

24:40.840 --> 24:42.400
There's another option.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.200
What option?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.400
No approval.

24:50.640 --> 24:55.040
-Will that get him back?
-God willing.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.040
So go get my brother back.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.600
Bring him back.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.400
-I object.
-Why?

25:22.240 --> 25:24.480
-How else will you get him back?
-Not like this.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.720
Doron, we can't do that
just because he's your relative.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.880
That's not the point, he's a team
member, that's more than family.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.920
It's mutiny.
They'll throw you all in jail.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.440
You're such a goddamn wuss.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.880
You goddamn wuss!

25:44.040 --> 25:46.400
And you know
what's really fucked up?

25:46.600 --> 25:50.200
-Boaz would do it for you in a heartbeat.
-Is that so?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.160
I wouldn't do this for you.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.720
-Is that so?
-Yep.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.600
You son of a bitch!

25:58.760 --> 26:03.800
-Go fuck yourself, you bastard!
-Get outta my face, you faggot!

26:03.960 --> 26:06.960
-Cool it!
-He's a fucking wuss!

26:07.120 --> 26:09.720
Alright, I'm calm.

26:12.240 --> 26:16.040
We might end up in jail,
but I don't give a fuck.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.640
I'm going to get Boaz.
You're all welcome to join me.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.960
I'm in.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.960
You bet I'm in.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.520
They're out of their minds.
We gotta report them.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.840
Nurit.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.800
[What have they done?]

27:08.960 --> 27:10.760
[What did you do to me?]

27:10.920 --> 27:12.800
[What did you do to me?]

27:34.360 --> 27:35.720
[Are you awake?]

27:35.880 --> 27:37.440
[What did you do to me?]

27:38.080 --> 27:39.880
[A minor surgery.]

27:43.120 --> 27:45.920
[To pay us back an old debt.]

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
[Ali Karmi's daughter.]

27:50.520 --> 27:52.440
[You'll be helping her out.]

27:54.600 --> 27:56.840
[What are you talking about?]

27:57.240 --> 27:58.840
[What are you talking about?!]

27:59.000 --> 28:00.840
[What are you talking about?!]

28:06.480 --> 28:08.040
[What are you talking about?!]

28:08.200 --> 28:10.160
[What are you talking about?]

28:11.040 --> 28:13.240
[What are you talking about,
you son of a bitch?!]

28:13.400 --> 28:15.880
<i>Once again, we cannot</i>
<i>give details about the incident</i>

28:16.040 --> 28:18.120
<i>that happened in the abandoned</i>
<i>factory near Tul Qarem.</i>

28:18.280 --> 28:21.240
<i>We're aware of the rumors</i>
<i>that almost everyone has heard,</i>

28:21.400 --> 28:25.280
<i>but censorship forbids us from</i>
<i>giving further details about it.</i>

28:27.240 --> 28:30.000
-Hello?
-Hey, Guli.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.200
I won't be available
for several days, but...

28:34.080 --> 28:35.880
...everything will be alright.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.640
What's going on?

28:39.440 --> 28:41.440
I can't discuss it over the phone.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.720
-Is that Dad?
-Yes.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.720
Put him on the phone.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.000
-Dad?
-Hey, Ido.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.920
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.040
Dad, are they really
going to kill Boaz?

29:00.880 --> 29:03.040
Of course not.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.280
-Are you getting him back?
-Sure thing.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.760
-When?
-Soon.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.120
Just make sure
they don't kidnap you too.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.040
-Dad? Can you hear me?
-Loud and clear, Ido, buddy.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.240
Don't worry. I'm looking
after Mom and Noga.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.600
Dad?

29:37.080 --> 29:39.040
Ido, I gotta hang up.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.440
Give me the phone.
Doron?

29:53.520 --> 29:54.560
It's okay.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.440
TUL QAREM

30:27.400 --> 30:29.360
[Move or I shoot!]

30:29.880 --> 30:32.280
Shoot! Shoot!

30:34.640 --> 30:36.000
[Allahu Akbar!]

30:36.720 --> 30:38.880
[Get in the car!]

30:40.160 --> 30:43.200
[Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!]

30:44.120 --> 30:45.440
Go!

30:53.360 --> 30:55.640
Sheikh Awdallah
has been kidnapped.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.640
-Was it us?
-I don't think so.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.640
I can't find anyone.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.880
Bastard.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.480
Moreno, the Defense Minister
is on the phone.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.660
-Yes?
-Don't tell me that we did it.

31:16.820 --> 31:18.440
I just heard about it.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.120
-Where's Doron Kabilio?
-I haven't tracked him yet.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.040
Moreno, if your guys are behind this,
your career is over.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.440
Let's all calm down a bit.
We--

31:32.440 --> 31:34.080
Where is that moron?

31:47.440 --> 31:49.120
[We're here.]

31:57.320 --> 31:58.680
[Move it.]

32:03.680 --> 32:05.280
[Come on, move it.]

32:17.040 --> 32:18.600
Hello?

32:18.880 --> 32:19.920
We got him.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.960
-Are you insane?!
-It was the only way to save Boaz.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.360
-Who's with you? Where are you?
-The less you know, the better.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.040
Is Nurit with you?

32:29.560 --> 32:33.400
Put Nurit on the phone, now!
Doron? Doron!

32:45.400 --> 32:46.840
Son of a bitch.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.200
[What happens now?]

33:13.360 --> 33:18.320
Now Abu Ahmad has 24 hours
to release our friend.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.960
[And if he refuses?]

33:23.120 --> 33:27.160
[If he refuses,
I will behead you.]

33:27.400 --> 33:28.480
[Understood?]
