00:10.301 --> 00:12.303
[theme music playing]

01:02.812 --> 01:03.938
[gasps]

01:04.939 --> 01:07.025
[panting]

01:20.038 --> 01:23.124
[Honerva]
Exit at coordinates beta-four-ex-seven.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.627
The Paladins are aware of our plans.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.128
Is that a problem?

01:27.754 --> 01:30.173
No, it's an advantage.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.477
[Coran] What happened to her?

01:42.560 --> 01:43.645
It was the entity.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.314
Honerva was able to use it against her.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.152
I told her infiltrating Honerva's mind
was too dangerous.

01:51.694 --> 01:52.904
I told you all!

01:53.947 --> 01:55.657
She's going to pull through.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.826
-How do you know?
-[PA beeps]

01:57.909 --> 01:59.702
[Shiro over PA]
Paladins, to the bridge.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.415
[Shiro] Honerva's been off the grid
since we left Oriande...

02:04.499 --> 02:05.500
until now.

02:05.875 --> 02:09.671
We just detected a wormhole signature
at coordinates beta-four-ex-seven.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.590
Unfortunately,
without Allura's ability to wormhole,

02:12.674 --> 02:13.716
we'll never get to her.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.269
[Honerva] We will be back
on Altea soon, my son.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.439
[whirring]

02:39.450 --> 02:41.452
[engine humming]

03:37.675 --> 03:40.261
We now know why
Honerva retrieved Lotor's mech.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.556
Since it's made
out of the same comet ore as Voltron,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.934
it has the ability to pierce realities.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.688
Honerva is gonna use Lotor's mech
to find her version of a perfect reality.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.441
Perfect reality?

03:53.942 --> 03:57.570
-Does that even exist?
-She's searching for it right now.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.782
And if it exists, she'll find it.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.203
The problem is the trans-reality ore
has been traveling between realities

04:05.286 --> 04:06.621
for millions of years.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.831
And it's a naturally occurring phenomenon.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.418
What Honerva is doing
is forcing that process to happen,

04:12.961 --> 04:15.129
which could have catastrophic side effects

04:15.213 --> 04:18.424
on this and any reality
she travels through.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.052
So, what's the plan?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.721
Maybe we can, we can make
a giant tractor beam?

04:23.805 --> 04:26.266
Sam, you could do that, right?
Make a giant tractor beam?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.560
We could pull her to us
and then blow her up with a star bomb!

04:30.186 --> 04:31.771
Pidge? A star bomb?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.898
[Lance] There is no plan, Hunk.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.735
We know what Honerva wants to do,
but we can't get to her.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.947
And even if we could,
she has the ability to wormhole away.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.283
Without Allura, we can't chase her,

04:44.158 --> 04:45.743
and we can't form Voltron.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.122
Well, we have to do something.
We'll prepare for battle.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.915
We need to be ready to face Honerva.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.043
We've been tracking a Galra fleet
within our vicinity.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.421
Our intel shows
they have a Zaiforge cannon.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.091
Maybe Kolivan and I can take a small team
and commandeer the ship.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.428
Why don't you take Commander Lahn
and try to recruit them to our side?

05:03.594 --> 05:05.805
We don't want to fight more battles
than we have to.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.559
In the meantime, Slav and I
have been working on prototype upgrades

05:09.642 --> 05:11.227
for the Atlas' weapon system.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.605
Of course, we'll have to somehow find
extra power for them.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.443
Always making the most amazing things
in the universe,

05:18.526 --> 05:21.029
but never having enough power to run them.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.698
New weapons?
I'll give you guys a hand with that.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.075
And I may know
where we can get the extra power.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.119
There's a small Balmera in this territory.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.872
All right! A little trip to a Balmera.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.790
-We'll take the Yellow Lion.
-And Romelle.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.834
I've been training her on Altean customs.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.503
She'll be quite helpful
in communicating with the Balmera.

05:37.837 --> 05:38.671
Good idea.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.966
Everyone, let's stay focused
on what we can accomplish.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.850
[Keith] She's gonna be okay.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.477
I hope so.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.105
We need to stop Honerva...

05:56.522 --> 05:59.567
this force of evil that's been around
for 10,000 years.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.987
She has a plan
that could destroy every reality,

06:03.071 --> 06:04.322
and all we've come up with

06:04.405 --> 06:06.949
is additional manpower
and a prototype weapon.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.701
I know it's not ideal...

06:09.243 --> 06:11.662
but when is the last time
anything has been ideal?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.249
Remember when we first arrived
at the Castle of Lions?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.751
When we first met Allura?

06:17.001 --> 06:19.879
She told us we were the answer
to saving the universe,

06:19.962 --> 06:21.923
but she didn't know that for sure.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.343
But Allura believed,
and she needed us to believe.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.677
And it worked.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.305
Back then, I was cocky enough
to actually think

06:29.388 --> 06:31.641
I was the greatest pilot in the universe.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.227
And I thought
I could do everything myself.

06:35.394 --> 06:39.398
-We've come a long way since then.
-[chuckles] Yeah, we have.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.152
We haven't lost until we've lost hope.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.029
I haven't given up.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.448
Let's finish what we started.

06:50.993 --> 06:55.289
I'll be gone for a short while,
accompanying Hunk and Coran to a Balmera.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.916
The Coalition needs help.

06:57.583 --> 07:02.880
I can only hope, through your actions,
our people can make some small amends

07:02.964 --> 07:04.006
for what we've done.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.759
If there's anything we can do
to assist you...

07:07.385 --> 07:09.971
Well, we could use some more help
on the Balmera.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.515
Its life source is strengthened
by Altean energy.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.644
We wish we could join you,
but that may not be wise.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.188
We still have the entity within us.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.234
I fear Honerva may use us against you
at any moment.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.529
Let me go with you.
I want to help.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.364
Thank you.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.116
Stay strong.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.494
The Coalition will stop Honerva
before that can happen.

07:35.163 --> 07:39.083
[Sam] The weapon we're trying to create
uses the Atlas' current cannon array.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.170
Slav correctly identified
that after the cannon fires,

07:42.253 --> 07:45.756
the chamber discharges atoms
along with trace elements of thorium.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.884
But it was your father
who came up with the idea

07:47.967 --> 07:50.761
to actually use the atoms
and thorium discharge!

07:51.262 --> 07:53.806
You want to turn our cannons
into a thorium ray?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.975
That's exactly what I asked!

07:56.184 --> 07:58.728
Pidge, all the elements are already there.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.021
It could work.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.648
He's right!
All we need is an atomic trajectory,

08:02.732 --> 08:05.776
which should be easy enough
based on the path of the cannon.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.904
And, of course,
we'll need that extra power.

08:07.987 --> 08:12.158
Also, we'll need to jump up and down
on one foot, count to three and shout out

08:12.241 --> 08:15.286
our favorite type of metal,
color or planetary atmosphere!

08:15.369 --> 08:16.537
We don't have time for that.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.415
You're telling me
you don't have time to live?

08:19.624 --> 08:22.126
One, two, three. Aluminum!

08:29.675 --> 08:31.093
[Keith] Good luck out there.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.430
-[monitor beeping]
-We got another wormhole signature!

08:35.097 --> 08:37.725
That's the fifth one
we've identified in the last hour.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.603
Have you been able find out any patterns
to these locations?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.396
Negative, sir. Nothing new.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.442
Is Honerva sending those beasts of hers
out across the universe again?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.443
It could be.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.780
Or... it could be her.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.823
There has to be more we can do!

08:53.658 --> 08:54.742
I wish there was.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.871
But without Allura, it could take us days,
maybe weeks to get to Honerva.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.959
For now, all we can do is wait and watch.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.962
[exhales]
What is she up to?

09:07.421 --> 09:08.256
Hang on.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.383
Veronica, cross check
those latest coordinates

09:10.466 --> 09:11.801
with our patrol squadrons.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.386
[electronic chirping]

09:13.469 --> 09:15.930
[Veronica] It appears we have
a long-range scout in the area.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.306
Zulu-beta-one-one.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.476
Get me on comms
with the squadron commander immediately.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.856
[Shiro] Commander Ozar, we need your team
to do some reconnaissance for us.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.149
[Ozar] Yes, Captain.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.320
[Shiro] We're sending you coordinates now.
This is an intelligence-gathering mission.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.365
Keep your distance
and run only essential systems.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.326
Do not engage.
We're dealing with Honerva.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.161
Copy that, sir.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.300
[lieutenant] We're coming around.
Should have a visual in a few ticks.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.886
Keep us hidden in the asteroid cluster.
Bring up our monitors.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.602
[lieutenant] I've never seen
a ship like that before,

10:02.685 --> 10:04.061
and there's something behind it.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.146
[Ozar] Adjust angle.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.189
Find out what that thing is.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.036
Oh, no.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.789
Captain Shirogane,
it appears Honerva has some kind of--

10:23.873 --> 10:25.041
-[booms]
-[crew shouts]

10:34.884 --> 10:37.136
-Evasive maneuvers! Open fire!
-[alarms beeping]

10:55.988 --> 10:57.156
[Curtis] Two ships down!

10:57.239 --> 10:58.783
They need to get out of there!

10:58.866 --> 11:00.785
Commander Ozar, do you copy?

11:01.619 --> 11:04.955
-[Ozar] Fall back! [screams]
-[Veronica] We've lost connection!

11:14.840 --> 11:16.467
Preparations are complete.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.636
Set a course for Altea.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.346
It's time.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.016
[Slav] One, two, three. Yellow!

11:24.725 --> 11:25.684
One, two, three.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.229
We are so close to finishing
this cannon upgrade.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.563
Why do you keep doing that?

11:29.980 --> 11:33.275
What I don't understand
is why aren't you joining me?

11:33.359 --> 11:38.072
I've explained data point probability
extrapolation multiple times!

11:38.155 --> 11:40.449
Is it too hard to believe
that small changes

11:40.533 --> 11:43.327
can alter entire reality trajectories?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.079
No, that's not hard to believe.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.832
What's hard to believe
is that someone can predict the future

11:47.915 --> 11:50.960
based on probabilities calculated
from random data points.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.215
Wait, you've done that?

11:56.507 --> 11:59.677
I calculate future probabilities
in my spare time for fun.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.804
And trust me,
if this one does not change,

12:01.887 --> 12:04.807
the trajectory we're on
will lead us to total annihilation.

12:04.974 --> 12:09.311
A reality-ending event with repercussions
through space-time itself.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.149
Everything that is,
that ever will be, and that ever was,

12:13.232 --> 12:16.485
will cease to exist
in the blink of an eye.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.738
One, two, three. Yellow!

12:20.739 --> 12:23.492
-One, two, three. Palladium!
-One, two, three. Yellow!

12:23.701 --> 12:25.244
[beeping]

12:25.327 --> 12:27.037
[Veronica] Honerva has made another jump.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.707
-Bringing up her location.
-[electronic chirping]

12:30.207 --> 12:31.375
That star system...

12:32.084 --> 12:34.420
It's where Altea and Daibazaal
once existed.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.592
-Sir?
-She's returned home.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.137
That's where she's going
to cross through realities.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.479
Allura...

12:52.229 --> 12:55.316
I don't know if you can hear me,
but we need your help.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.486
Honerva could cross through realities
anytime now,

12:58.569 --> 13:00.821
and you're the only one
that can get us to her.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.406
Please.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.325
We need you.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.328
This universe needs you.
Every reality needs you.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.871
[stammers] And most of all...

13:09.997 --> 13:10.915
I need you.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.543
I can't imagine this world without you.

13:16.545 --> 13:17.588
Come back to me.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.473
[softly] Lance?

13:29.350 --> 13:30.226
Allura!

13:35.856 --> 13:37.733
The princess has awakened.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.280
Allura!

13:43.697 --> 13:45.157
It's great to have you back.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.492
How are you feeling?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.161
A little weak, but I'll manage.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.831
I hate to throw all this on you at once,
but we don't have much time.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.751
We need to get
to Altea's coordinates immediately.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.628
Honerva is already there.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.338
What about Hunk and Coran?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.466
Veronica, open up a channel
to the Yellow Lion.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.592
Comms active.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.137
[Shiro] Hunk, this is the Atlas.
What's your status?

14:07.846 --> 14:09.014
Hey, guys, good news.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.392
We found a new Balmera
and new Balmerans.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.602
Say hi! Hey!

14:14.520 --> 14:15.396
They're shy.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.023
Anyway, we're having trouble
finding a big enough crystal.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.819
But, uh, don't worry, Coran came up
with a crazy plan that just might work.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.865
It's not that crazy, actually.
It's a very level-headed, reasonable plan.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.157
The opposite of crazy.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.617
Do what you must.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.161
I can wormhole you to our location
whenever you're ready.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.497
Allura, you're okay!

14:33.831 --> 14:35.416
Oh, thank the ancients!

14:35.833 --> 14:38.669
Attention, crew,
ready the Atlas for wormhole jump.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.672
MFE squadron,
prepare for launch on my command.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.007
This is not a drill.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.459
-What's she doing?
-I don't know.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.711
But we're going to stop her.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.714
Paladins, get to your Lions.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.842
Allura, you'll need to wait
until Hunk and Coran are ready to return.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.844
We need Voltron as soon as possible.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.575
[grunts] I can't get through!

15:51.784 --> 15:53.410
[pants] Me neither!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.579
-Shields!
-Yes, sir!

15:59.959 --> 16:02.753
We'll draw their fire.
Paladins, get to Honerva.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.838
Copy that! Fall back to me.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.382
Let's take another pass!

16:24.274 --> 16:27.027
[Hunk] Atlas, come in.
We're ready to head back.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.570
Activating the--

16:28.654 --> 16:29.905
[screams]

16:29.989 --> 16:31.740
[groaning]

16:31.824 --> 16:33.784
[Honerva] Arise, my children.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.787
The time has come to act.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.290
Repent for your traitorous ways.

16:41.041 --> 16:46.338
Lend me your Quintessence,
and all will be forgiven.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.929
[grunting]

16:55.347 --> 16:57.349
[alarm blaring]

16:58.892 --> 17:01.228
Sir, the Alteans have escaped their cells!

17:01.311 --> 17:03.731
-Get me eyes on them!
-Putting them on screen!

17:13.240 --> 17:14.950
Bridge, prepare for breach!

17:15.951 --> 17:17.411
[thudding]

17:20.873 --> 17:21.707
Stop!

17:21.999 --> 17:23.625
[groaning]

17:31.550 --> 17:36.055
Deliver me the power I need
to return to our homeland.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.725
Give your energy
along with the ship's crystal.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.769
All of it.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.402
No!

17:53.822 --> 17:55.032
[lasers firing]

17:58.327 --> 17:59.369
My people.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.503
[all screaming]

18:09.588 --> 18:12.800
Honerva, transferring that much energy
will destroy them!

18:12.883 --> 18:16.553
Their lives will be sacrificed
for their savior.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.041
[screams]

18:59.555 --> 19:00.389
[groans]

19:03.725 --> 19:06.603
[power shuts down]

19:10.274 --> 19:12.067
[Hunk, muffled] Hello?
What's going on?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.944
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[Allura groans]

19:14.027 --> 19:15.904
[Hunk] Hello? Anybody, please!

19:16.613 --> 19:17.447
Are you there?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.408
[groans]

19:20.117 --> 19:21.285
Honerva.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.164
Yes, right away.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.966
[Hunk] Atlas, we're back,
and we brought along a friend.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.471
Copy that. Good timing.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.515
Contact Sam and Slav,

19:43.599 --> 19:45.726
and tell them to prepare the weapon
for the crystal.

19:45.809 --> 19:46.643
Yes, sir!

19:47.644 --> 19:49.313
Get the Alteans to the med bay.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.190
We have a chance.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.817
[Balmera bellowing]

19:55.402 --> 19:56.945

20:33.523 --> 20:35.817
-[Balmera howling]
-[all screaming]

20:53.710 --> 20:56.129
Paladins, attack!

21:47.514 --> 21:48.724
[grunts]
