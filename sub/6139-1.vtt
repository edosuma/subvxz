00:44.044 --> 00:46.254
Apollo is saying,
"Come on, come on, come on!"

00:46.338 --> 00:50.633
Apollo is going left. He's going
for another left. Another left.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.970
Now he's gone for the left.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.850
Down on one knee. Lou Filippo
in there wiping off the glove.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.566
A hard left
and a right combination.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.236
What is keeping
him up, Bill? I don't know.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.241
He can't even get his
gloves up to protect himself.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.208
Down! Down! Stay down!

01:24.293 --> 01:27.336
Apollo dancing around
with his arms in the air.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.182
Five,

01:40.309 --> 01:42.014
six, seven,

01:43.270 --> 01:45.480
eight, nine...

01:52.613 --> 01:53.988
Come on!

01:55.115 --> 01:57.825
Apollo
can't believe it.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.762
The champion got a left to
the ribs, his right ribs.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.854
You okay, champ?

02:26.939 --> 02:28.231
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.565
Your rib's broken.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.817
He broke my ribs!

02:30.901 --> 02:34.195
I can't see nothing. Gotta
open my eye. Cut me, Mick.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.279
I don't want to do it!

02:35.364 --> 02:36.823
Go on, cut me.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.115
Cut me.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.992
Okay.
Try and cut it.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.495
You're bleeding inside, champ.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.457
Hey, you ain't stopping nothing,
man. You ain't stopping nothing.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.334
You stop this fight,
I'll kill you!

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
All right.
I won't stop it.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.879
I'm going!
You want to go...

02:51.964 --> 02:53.506
Last round!

02:53.590 --> 02:55.049
You gotta give it
your all!

02:55.133 --> 02:57.760
Get it off! You gotta
get him down in the body.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.435
There's the bell
for the 15th and final round.

03:09.815 --> 03:14.193
You better start fighting. You been
doing nothing. You been doing nothing.

03:14.278 --> 03:17.154
They look like they've
been in a war, these two.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.489
Come on over here.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.249
Apollo, the champion,
really tagged him.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.794
And Apollo clearly protecting
his right side, his ribs.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.131
Oh, look at that!

03:35.215 --> 03:36.299
Body punches!

03:37.509 --> 03:39.051
Hard left and right.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.553
Oh, look at the blood
coming out of his mouth.

03:40.637 --> 03:44.682
He's spitting up blood now.
He takes one to the head.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.477
A tremendous
right hand from Rocky.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.980
Go for it.
Go for it, Rock!

03:51.064 --> 03:52.231
Listen
to this crowd!

03:52.316 --> 03:53.482
Left to the ribs.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.403
Another to the ribs. That left
hand again. A right to the chin!

03:57.487 --> 04:02.033
He's got him up against the
ropes! Apollo, the champion...

04:04.745 --> 04:08.122
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.541
Don't want one.

04:19.843 --> 04:20.843
There's chaos.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.553
Rocky, you went the distance.
You went the 15 rounds.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.930
How do you feel? All right. All right.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.057
What were you thinking about
when that buzzer sounded off?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.099
Adrian!
What did you think about

04:27.184 --> 04:28.434
in the 15th round
when you were coming out?

04:28.518 --> 04:29.894
Adrian!

04:29.978 --> 04:32.980
Rocky. Rocky.

04:35.692 --> 04:39.403
Rocky! Rocky!

04:39.488 --> 04:44.033
We have had the privilege of
witnessing the greatest exhibition

04:44.117 --> 04:48.120
of guts and stamina
in the history of the ring.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.997
Adrian!

04:50.958 --> 04:52.708
Rocky!

04:52.793 --> 04:53.793
Ladies and gentlemen...

04:53.877 --> 04:54.877
Rocky!

04:54.962 --> 04:58.214
...we have a split decision.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.551
Adrian!

05:02.636 --> 05:05.471
Eight for Apollo Creed!
Rocky!

05:07.891 --> 05:10.017
Those fans out
there deserve a rematch.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.186
Ain't gonna be no rematch.
Come on!

05:12.270 --> 05:16.148
I had enough things
in my face today! Adrian!

05:16.233 --> 05:19.902
Rocko!
That's my friend. Rocko!

05:19.987 --> 05:22.363
You're breaking my jacket.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.156
Paulie!

05:24.241 --> 05:25.324
Adrian!

05:25.409 --> 05:26.409
Rocky!

05:26.493 --> 05:27.493
Adrian!
Rocky!

05:27.577 --> 05:29.120
Hey, where's your hat?

05:29.204 --> 05:30.496
I love you!

05:30.580 --> 05:31.914
I love you.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.503
I love you!
I love you!

05:37.587 --> 05:39.422
I love you.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.718
Hey, Rock!
Hey, Rocky!

07:51.096 --> 07:53.013
Rocky Balboa!

07:53.098 --> 07:54.890
Get them
out of here!

07:54.975 --> 07:59.186
Let him breathe, will you? Give him air!

07:59.271 --> 08:01.897
Sit down, Rocky.
Sit down.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.065
Rocky, do you think you had it won?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.150
I don't know. I...

08:04.234 --> 08:06.318
How about
a statement, Rocky?

08:06.403 --> 08:08.529
I don't know.
I'm at a loss for words.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.822
Get back there!

08:09.906 --> 08:11.031
Rocky,
do you think you had it won?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.283
I don't know.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.534
Rocky, stay!

08:13.618 --> 08:14.785
Where's the doctor?

08:14.870 --> 08:16.871
How's my nose look?
As bad as Mickey's?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.998
It ain't that horrible.
Now give him a break.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.499
Just one more.
Get out of there.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.084
Rocky, is that the worst
beating you ever took?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.420
You! No, you're gonna get worse
if you don't get out of here.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.089
Rocky, what did you think
going into the last round?

08:27.174 --> 08:29.800
I don't know. That I should have
stayed in school or something.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.635
Rocky, do you think
you have brain damage?

08:31.720 --> 08:32.720
I don't see any.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.597
Where is he?
Where is he?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.765
Apollo,
how about a statement?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.101
Get away from me! How
about a statement, Apollo?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.437
Hey, Stallion! Stallion!

08:41.520 --> 08:43.355
You got a dull skull,
Stallion.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.317
You're lucky, so lucky.
What you did was a miracle.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.902
You're the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.278
I want you to
know that, Stallion.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.487
Do I look lucky?

08:50.572 --> 08:52.448
Look, nobody goes
the distance with me.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.159
Get up out of that chair, chump, and
let's finish this fight right now.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.493
Apollo, don't, please.
Sit down.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.703
Is he serious?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.538
Were you going down? Did
the bell save you, Apollo?

08:59.623 --> 09:01.457
Bell nothing, man.
I can beat that chump.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.125
I'll fight him
any place, any time.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.418
Does that mean
there'll be a rematch?

09:04.502 --> 09:07.046
I said any place, any
time, man. Can you hear?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.840
Hey, yo, Apollo, you said there
weren't gonna be no rematch.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.550
Look, chump,
any place, any time.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.969
Rocky, a rematch
could be worth millions.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.596
Well, I'm officially
retired now.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.181
Don't you run out
on me now.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.307
Don't you run out
on me, Stallion.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.810
I gave you a shot the first time. Now
I'm ready to give you a second shot.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.563
He sure has a lot of energy. You
know, you got nothing to prove.

09:24.648 --> 09:28.901
I don't care what the hell them judges
said. This is the man that won the fight!

09:28.985 --> 09:32.279
I'm gonna show you how lucky you are!
You're gonna fight me again, chump!

09:32.364 --> 09:35.407
Come back here! Don't run out
on me! Come back here, Rock!

09:35.492 --> 09:36.700
Yo, Adrian?
Yes.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.869
You'd better go home
'cause I'm gonna be busy

09:38.954 --> 09:40.955
healing here for a while,
you know.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.581
I want to be here.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.792
No, maybe you better go home
with Paulie and get some sleep...

09:44.876 --> 09:48.212
Wait a minute.
Get some sleep, you know.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.508
I love you.
I love you.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.134
I love you. See you.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.719
See you later.
See you, Mick.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.100
Can you fix my nose?

10:01.184 --> 10:04.311
I'm a little depressed
about my nose.

10:04.396 --> 10:08.065
We'll fix that all right.
It's the eye that concerns me.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.693
The eye's great.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.072
I ain't never
really felt this good.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.576
You guys should've
seen us tonight.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.413
We did good.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.750
I almost won, you know...
You should've seen it.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.840
You had him in the 10th,
and in the 15th he was gone.

10:33.675 --> 10:34.967
You think so?

10:35.051 --> 10:36.260
Trust me.
I was there.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.013
How's your face,
Rock?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.639
I don't know.
How's it look?

10:41.725 --> 10:43.726
I wouldn't want it.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.938
Rocky, I got a little favor
I'd like to ask of you.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.734
You know, your friend Gazzo,
he admires you a lot.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.445
Tell him to give me
your old job with him.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.155
You mean collecting?

10:56.239 --> 10:57.323
Yeah, I'm good with numbers.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.407
Yeah.

10:59.409 --> 11:03.037
Okay. As soon as I get
finished, you know, healing here,

11:03.580 --> 11:07.249
I'll tell him to give
you my old job, okay?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.500
I'd appreciate that.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.419
What are you doing here?

11:11.087 --> 11:14.757
Visiting hours are over.
I have to ask you to leave.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.551
Now.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.927
Okay. See you later,
Paulie.

11:19.054 --> 11:22.056
Okay. Everybody's proud
of you, Rock. Yeah?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.766
Yeah.
Now.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.184
I feel good tonight.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.602
Yeah, you look good.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.936
Let's go.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.691
How are we feeling tonight?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.276
Oh, very handsome.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.870
That tastes good.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.622
My kid would die
for your autograph.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.208
Sure.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.250
Would you sign it,
please,

11:50.335 --> 11:52.878
"To my good friend,
Charlie Flynn. "

11:54.506 --> 11:55.631
My hands are so sore.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.799
It's okay.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.722
It's my first autograph.
Thank you.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.307
You're welcome.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.775
"To my good friend, Charlie
Flynn," who I don't even know.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.159
Yo, Apollo?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.246
Who is it?

12:27.330 --> 12:28.747
It's just me, Rocky.
Listen.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.166
Could you answer
me one question?

12:31.835 --> 12:33.085
Yeah, sure.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.462
Did you give me your best?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.174
Yeah. Yeah.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.346
Thank you.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.110
This coming year, you know,
Rocky. How you feeling?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.236
You all right?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
Yeah, I feel great
being outside.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.781
This coming year, you're
gonna make $300,000 with us.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.116
Yeah?
This fiscal year.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.451
Hey, Rock!

13:05.535 --> 13:06.785
Hey, how you doing,
Pete?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.454
Hey, could you sign
my head?

13:08.538 --> 13:09.580
Yeah, sure.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.789
Thanks.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.374
Hope it don't
go to your brain.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.626
Bet that's heavy.
A little bit.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.421
Yeah, well, just think how fast
you'll be when you get it off.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.714
Just a minute. Can I
borrow this? Thanks a lot.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.257
Let me use your
head for a minute, kid.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.217
Here, sign, Rocky.
It's a standard deal.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.219
Wait. I want to talk to you
a little bit about this here.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.554
It's a standard
deal...

13:25.638 --> 13:27.055
Just for talking
about shaving stuff?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.557
That's all you do.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.975
Sledgehammers, whatever. Batteries...

13:30.059 --> 13:31.810
We've got all kinds, of course,
all kinds of commercials,

13:31.936 --> 13:33.270
so it could be anything.
Like balls and baseballs?

13:33.354 --> 13:34.855
Yeah, you're gonna
make $300,000.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.690
You gotta strike now while
the iron's hot, you know.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.816
Yeah. 20 minutes, it's all over.

13:37.901 --> 13:38.984
Yeah, people kind
of forget, you know.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.110
The time is now,

13:40.195 --> 13:41.320
if you want to make a dollar. Right now.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.907
Here. Sign it here. It takes you two
seconds to sign. It's a standard deal.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.826
Okay, I tell you what, I'll sign
it, but I gotta go somewhere now.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.661
Where you going? What could
be more important than this?

13:49.746 --> 13:53.790
I just gotta do some things, but
I'll be back. I'll talk to you.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.042
Give me a call, then.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.251
Where will we call you?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.544
I'll give you a call.

13:57.629 --> 13:58.795
I call you.
You got a number?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.965
I'll just call you. I'll
go, "Hey! Yo!" I'll call you.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.800
Okay. All right,
you call. Here.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.637
The guy's got
brain damage.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.806
You know, it's great
being out of the hospital

14:09.891 --> 14:12.851
and not having to take all
those pills and everything.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.688
And my legs were getting so sore and
all that, you know, just laying there.

14:16.773 --> 14:21.735
I was kind of shrinking and all that.
It's great to be outside, you know?

14:23.488 --> 14:25.364
What are we doing
here at the zoo?

14:25.448 --> 14:28.325
Well, you know, I kind of
like the zoo a lot, you know.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.536
It's a special place,
especially when it snows,

14:30.620 --> 14:33.789
you know, it kind of smells clean
and everything like that, you know.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.166
Don't you like the zoo?
Huh?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.876
I like the zoo.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.127
Yeah, me, too.

14:41.965 --> 14:45.467
You know,
I was wondering, like,

14:45.552 --> 14:50.138
what do you think you're doing
for, like, the next 40 or 50 years?

14:50.223 --> 14:52.724
What do you mean?

14:57.146 --> 15:02.150
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind marrying me very much.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.238
What'd you say?

15:07.282 --> 15:10.367
If you wouldn't mind
marrying me too much.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.873
Yes. I'd like
to marry you.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.167
Yeah?
Yes.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.129
Yeah?
Yes.

15:31.806 --> 15:35.809
I'll be a good guy, I promise.
I ain't gonna do nothing wrong.

15:35.893 --> 15:40.522
I ain't gonna leave no hair in the
sink or nothing like that, you know.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.817
Things are gonna be great,
you know that? Hey!

15:43.901 --> 15:47.154
Hey, we're getting married,
you know. You want to come?

15:47.238 --> 15:50.616
If you can get out for the weekend,
I'll send you an invitation, Mr. Tiger!

15:50.700 --> 15:52.701
That's fantastic,
ain't it?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.427
Yeah, absolutely.
Yes.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.727
I do.
Thanks.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.235
You may kiss the bride now.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.738
I gotta take this off?

16:29.822 --> 16:30.906
Yeah.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.835
Go in peace and God bless you.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.421
Thanks, Father. You done
real good. I'm proud of you.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.507
Okay. Things are
gonna be great.

16:48.591 --> 16:49.883
Rocky,
congratulations!

16:49.967 --> 16:53.011
Thanks a lot, thanks
a lot. Thanks, Tony.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.013
Hey, I ain't gonna need any
luck. Everything's gonna be okay.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.182
Hey, Rock, you want to
buy into the pet shop?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.643
Well, thanks, but I wanna
do commercials instead.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.019
Commercials? What for? Concussions?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.187
Yeah. Concussions.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.021
Rocky.
Yeah.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.567
Isn't that Father
something?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.694
Good luck to the both of
you. Thank you very much.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.696
Well, thanks, Mick.
I gotta go back to the gym.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.531
I got a couple
of good prospects.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.700
Yeah? Are they
really good?

17:14.784 --> 17:15.867
Yeah, they're
pretty good.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.203
All right. See you around,
Mick. Thanks for coming.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.538
Can we go
drink now?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.249
Excuse me, can I borrow the
bridegroom for one minute?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.209
You look beautiful, Adrian.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.169
Yeah, she really
turned out pretty.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.047
Now, listen, how much money
you make from your last fight?

17:29.132 --> 17:31.633
I mean, how much money
did you clear?

17:31.718 --> 17:32.884
About 37 grand.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.052
I know, taxes kill you.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.387
Hey, what do you wanna do
with your money now?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.848
You want to put
them on the street?

17:37.932 --> 17:40.058
Hey, Tony,
I just got married in here.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.685
I know,
and I'm happy for you.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.896
How's about investing in
condominiums? It's safe.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.022
Condominiums?

17:46.107 --> 17:47.858
Yeah, condominiums.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.237
I never use them.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.019
Hey, yo!
What are youse doing?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.605
Hey, Rock!
What's happening, man?

18:26.689 --> 18:29.107
Well, you know, I just got
a little married, you know.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.776
Hey, Rock,
congratulations!

18:30.860 --> 18:32.611
What are you guys doing?
Drinking some wine here?

18:32.695 --> 18:33.904
Yeah, man,
we're doing it.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.280
Keep singing some more.
I like that stuff.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.115
Okay, babe. Sing
something for him, Frank.

18:37.200 --> 18:42.954
There are two kinds of love
That you ought to know

18:43.039 --> 18:47.542
There are two kinds
of love

18:47.627 --> 18:49.711
There are two kinds of...

18:49.796 --> 18:50.921
Who are they?

18:51.005 --> 18:52.672
They're like the neighborhood's
jukebox, you know.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.424
Those guys are
singing all the time.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.343
You know, I never knew you
were so light, you know.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.969
Never?
No. If I did,

18:58.054 --> 18:59.846
I would have carried
you everywhere.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.223
Are you getting tired?

19:01.307 --> 19:04.017
No, this is great for
the arms. I think it is.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.644
I can't believe
we're married.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.938
Oh, we are. I got proof
in my pocket.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.397
Everything happened so fast.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.649
Yeah.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.984
But I knew what was gonna
happen from the start.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.736
What did you know?
Well...

19:14.821 --> 19:18.949
The first time I see you,
I says to myself, I says,

19:19.033 --> 19:22.702
even though this girl is suffering
from the disease of being shy,

19:22.787 --> 19:25.914
underneath them
sweaters and hat and...

19:25.998 --> 19:27.624
What did you have on?
About 20 sweaters, was it?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.251
No, three.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.504
Yeah, Three Sweaters is the
best girl in Philly, you know.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.589
Oh. Oh, yeah! I said that.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.383
I said that. Oh, yeah. Really?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.847
All right, here we are, safe
and sound. Hey, yo, Butkus!

19:41.931 --> 19:45.058
Could you get down?
Go on.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.644
Go find another seat,
will you?

19:52.567 --> 19:55.068
You want me to
help you with this?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.828
Hey, can I take
this off?

20:06.247 --> 20:08.248
That's the way
I like you.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.168
You know,

20:12.253 --> 20:15.714
you're the best thing that ever come
into my crazy life, you know that? Huh?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.134
Really.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.476
You're the best thing that
ever come into my life.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.821
You think it'll
always be like this?

20:41.657 --> 20:43.658
Yeah.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.870
I hope you...
What?

20:48.539 --> 20:50.749
You never get tired of me.

20:50.833 --> 20:55.337
Oh, no. You ain't
never getting rid of me.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.800
I hope nothing changes.

21:00.885 --> 21:05.263
I ain't changing. I sure ain't
never changing nothing about you.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.018
I love you.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.686
I love you, too.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.160
Hey, yo!

22:09.245 --> 22:10.662
It's a nice car, Rock. It's a great car.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.830
Well, here's
the papers, Rock.

22:11.914 --> 22:12.998
Thanks a lot.
Yeah.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.207
Congratulations.
Lots of luck.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.417
Thanks a lot.
Same to you.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.668
Same to you.
Isn't that nice?

22:16.752 --> 22:17.961
We really don't
need a car.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.170
Oh, come on,
Adrian.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.797
You know, I'm gonna be
doing commercials now.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.174
I can afford this, you know.
No problem.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.509
Well, do you know
how to drive?

22:24.593 --> 22:25.760
Do I know how to drive?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.262
Do you know how to drive?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.847
I'm one of the greats.
Are you kidding?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.015
Come on. I'll drive you.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.725
Let me put you
inside the car.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.436
This'll just be like Cinderella
and the pumpkin, you know.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.770
Do you know how
to drive?

22:35.855 --> 22:37.022
Do I know how to drive?

22:37.106 --> 22:39.190
I drive airplanes
and bulldozers.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.277
I'd drive you crazy if you'd give
me a chance, you know what I mean?

22:54.457 --> 22:56.583
Yo, Adrian!

22:56.667 --> 23:00.378
Look at this here. Tell me that
wouldn't look great on you, huh?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.797
This coat here? Huh?
What about that one?

23:02.882 --> 23:03.882
This coat's okay.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.551
Isn't that great? Look at this black
thing here with the tiger on the back.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.262
You like animals? I love
animals. Black. I like black.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.431
Black's kind of my favorite
color. You want to buy them?

23:11.515 --> 23:13.975
I say we get them before someone
else buys them. What do you say?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.061
Come on, Adrian.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.729
I think that would be perfect for her.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.355
Yeah, I think
that's perfect, too.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.733
Don't you think this is
kind of expensive, you know?

23:21.817 --> 23:25.028
Well, hey, do you like
having a good time, huh?

23:25.112 --> 23:27.030
Yes.
Then you need a good watch.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.449
I'll tell you what. I want to
get one for Paulie, too, okay?

23:29.575 --> 23:30.992
We'll take these. What
about one for yourself?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.577
One for me?
One for you.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.245
I can't tell time
very good,

23:34.330 --> 23:36.247
but, all right, I'll
take one, too. Very good.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.666
Hey, Gloria, you got something
nice for Butkus, you know?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.627
Sure thing, Rockhead.

23:40.711 --> 23:41.753
Do you like that?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.546
Yo, look at that.
Hey, Butkus!

23:43.631 --> 23:46.424
Look at that. Your neck
looks great, huh? Is that...

23:46.509 --> 23:48.384
Hey, Gloria, you got
something a little smaller?

23:48.469 --> 23:50.261
Yeah. Look at that.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.472
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.852
You see? Now that's
what I call class, huh?

23:57.937 --> 23:58.937
Real sharp.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.397
Yeah.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.573
You okay, Butkus?

24:13.452 --> 24:18.373
Nice house. I'd say that's a nice
house in general, wouldn't you?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.250
Look at these bricks,
Adrian.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.043
My husband's
an expert on bricks.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.378
Are these new bricks?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.130
Yeah, this is a very
solid neighborhood.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.339
Yeah? You're gonna like this very much.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.259
I like these bricks. There're very
nicely done here. Look very solid.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.301
Nice.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.137
Nice mailbox.
I like this mailbox.

24:32.221 --> 24:36.057
You know, these numbers almost add up
to nine. I like that. That's a good omen.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.435
Oh, wow.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.022
Nice house. Really...

24:43.107 --> 24:45.984
Hey, Adrian. Baby, that's a
great spot for the bag, you know.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.529
I could teach you how to work
that bag someday, you know.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.948
Does it have
copper plumbing?

24:52.032 --> 24:53.616
Upstairs and down.
Yeah?

24:53.701 --> 24:56.661
This whole house is supported
with steel. The whole thing.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.704
Yeah.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.707
All these floors
are solid oak. Solid.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.961
Mrs. Balboa, can I show you the kitchen?
I think you're gonna really like it.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.423
Solid.
That's good to know.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.010
Hey, Adrian, that's a great spot for
a radio. Right over there, you know?

25:12.094 --> 25:13.928
Look at these steps.
Nice steps.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.055
Hey, nice kitchen.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.182
Nice.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.267
Nice kitchen, yes.
Yeah.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.353
What are taxes
every year?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.689
$1,500.

25:24.773 --> 25:25.815
Hey, Adrian,
I like it.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.318
I know a pretty good
deal when I see one, too.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.446
Excuse me. I want to talk
to my husband for one second.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.031
Can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you?

25:33.115 --> 25:35.617
Sure, I'm available.
I got no appointments.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.371
Rocky, you are making this
man's job, you know, very easy.

25:40.456 --> 25:45.001
Now, the bank said it would give
us a $16,000 first mortgage at 9.5%.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.795
Well, hey, that don't matter.
I say we get the house now.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.172
Yeah, but we didn't
even go upstairs.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.507
That don't matter. That's just
details. I'm sure it's nice.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.843
Details, huh?
Are you sure?

25:53.928 --> 25:55.553
Absolutely. Okay?

25:55.638 --> 25:59.140
All right, we'll take the house.
And it better not leak, or else.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.558
You know, I just wanted
to tell you something.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.352
Excuse me. Could you
stand over there?

26:02.436 --> 26:03.811
I gotta talk secretly
with my wife. Okay?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.230
Sure, sure.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.773
I understand.
Yeah.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.693
You know,
I kind of feel stupid,

26:10.778 --> 26:12.779
talking like this with the
lights on and everything,

26:12.863 --> 26:15.657
but, you know, the house
here and the solid oak floors,

26:15.741 --> 26:17.242
and all that stuff,
and the plumbing,

26:17.326 --> 26:19.911
wouldn't be nothing without
you being here, 'cause,

26:19.995 --> 26:22.914
I don't know, without you
being here, I probably...

26:22.998 --> 26:25.250
I wouldn't be here either,
you know.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.543
You don't have to speak.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.087
No?

26:35.177 --> 26:38.304
Okay. Let's go
celebrate here.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.806
I'll beat you
to the pool!

26:39.890 --> 26:41.516
Hey, you guys.
Slow down.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.106
Mary Anne.
Mary Anne, listen to this.

26:48.190 --> 26:53.611
"You didn't beat nobody, and anybody who
knows boxing knows the fight was fixed. "

26:53.696 --> 26:55.363
This one came from London.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.991
"You call yourself the champ.
You're a fake.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.368
"The fight was a fake.
Go kill yourself. "

27:00.452 --> 27:03.997
Wouldn't you rather play with
the children than read hate mail?

27:04.081 --> 27:06.624
"How much did you get to
carry that bum for 15 rounds?

27:06.709 --> 27:08.042
"You're a disgrace
to your people. "

27:08.127 --> 27:10.128
Why can't you ignore it?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.046
Are you serious?

27:20.180 --> 27:23.975
Come on, let me get you in focus
there. All right, I'm ready.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.811
Are you blind, Rock?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.313
What are you
getting wise with me?

27:28.397 --> 27:32.191
Come on! Throw the ball, Swifty. Let me
see your best here. I'm waiting for you.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.860
I'm waiting for you.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.486
You can't even
play stickball!

27:35.571 --> 27:38.072
Hey, come on. I'm ready
now. I'm just warming up.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.240
Are you ready for this?

27:39.325 --> 27:42.493
You better keep your mouth closed.
It's coming in that direction.

27:42.578 --> 27:43.995
What a shot!

27:44.079 --> 27:45.955
Now I know the day
weren't no waste.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.623
Come on, Swifty.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.475
Yeah?
Yes.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.144
Yo, Adrian! You did it!

28:09.772 --> 28:12.357
Oh, yeah!
I knew you had it in you.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.484
You woke up this morning,
you had a smile on your face.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.194
I said, "Something special's
gonna happen today. "

28:16.278 --> 28:19.155
I wasn't sure what, but I
knew it was gonna be different.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.368
You know, I was thinking, if this
kid has your good looks, you know,

28:23.452 --> 28:25.661
and your good brains
and my good left hook,

28:25.746 --> 28:28.081
he's really
gonna be something.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.627
Oh, no, what if it's a girl?
What if it's a girl?

28:33.379 --> 28:35.713
Oh, I didn't think
about that.

28:35.798 --> 28:39.342
Well, she'll be everything I'm
not. She won't have to be shy.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.386
We could give her singing
and dancing lessons.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.595
Yeah. Yeah.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.972
How about a new dress every
day? Would you like that?

28:45.057 --> 28:48.976
Have to hire a bodyguard when she starts
going to school to keep all the boys away.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.522
You know how them little boys can
be. Real pests in general, can't they?

28:52.606 --> 28:56.401
And if it's a boy, I'd like
him to be just like the father.

28:58.028 --> 29:01.322
Don't you think one dumbbell
in the family's enough?

29:02.699 --> 29:05.493
I'll tell you one thing, this
kid ain't gonna get no tattoos.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.994
He ain't gonna be
hanging around no corners,

29:07.079 --> 29:09.038
ain't gonna dress
like no wiseguy like me.

29:09.123 --> 29:11.999
I'll tell you that. He's gonna
be a good somebody like you.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.918
Like you.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.086
No, no, no. Like you.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.796
Like you.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
No, no. Like you.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.424
Like you.

29:20.509 --> 29:24.095
Yo, Adrian.
We did it. Didn't we?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.556
How you feel, Rocky?
Pretty good.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.640
Yeah?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.684
Listen, the reason we didn't
call you a couple of months ago

29:29.768 --> 29:31.936
was we wanted to wait till
the swelling went down.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.020
I see.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.147
But you look
terrific now.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.857
Yeah? We're gonna make a buck together.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.859
Don't worry about it. Yeah. That's good.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.695
As a matter of fact, I got a deal
today from Smart Deal Toy Company.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.196
Did you ever hear of them?

29:42.281 --> 29:43.906
No.
Maybe Mrs. Rocky did.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.408
Did you ever hear
of a Smart Deal Toy?

29:45.492 --> 29:46.492
No.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.077
No? Big.
They're number one.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.788
And they want to make a
Rocky doll. You understand?

29:50.873 --> 29:52.457
You can kick it.
You can beat it.

29:52.541 --> 29:56.419
For kids. You can kick it. You
can beat it. It does everything.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.879
Pretty smart, yeah.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.297
That's right.
Takes a terrific beating.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.631
I think it's
a great idea.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.467
We're gonna make a lot
of money with it. Okay?

30:02.551 --> 30:04.218
Is he ready there?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.473
How do I look?
The best.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.557
Fabulous.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.393
Adrian, how do I look?

30:12.478 --> 30:13.644
Different.

30:13.729 --> 30:16.397
Sensational. Come on, let's get it on.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.232
Okay.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.235
He's gonna
be great.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.321
Don't be nervous.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.363
Yeah.
How do I look?

30:24.448 --> 30:25.531
I look stupid,
don't I?

30:25.616 --> 30:26.657
Yes.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.994
You got any deodorant?

30:30.078 --> 30:31.120
No.

30:31.205 --> 30:32.538
Excuse me.

30:33.582 --> 30:37.210
All right, we're ready. Let's
go, Arthur. In the cage, Rock.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.503
Just the way
we rehearsed.

30:38.587 --> 30:39.754
Everyone get
ready for picture now.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.172
Come on, Rock.
We're running late.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.174
Girls, come on.
Look alive, dear.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.842
Girls... Yeah.

30:44.927 --> 30:47.011
A little higher. Show the
product. Get ready here.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.304
That's it.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.015
Magic time!
Look alive!

30:51.099 --> 30:52.266
Quiet on the set.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.268
Roll, please.
Speed.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.770
Beast aftershave,
take one.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.896
Action!

30:57.231 --> 30:58.814
Go now?
Action.

30:59.775 --> 31:04.362
"In the morning, I splash it on
and it makes me smeel mainly. "

31:04.446 --> 31:06.864
"Smeel mainly"?
Cut!

31:07.324 --> 31:10.535
Isn't that "smell manly"?
Can you read that, Rock?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.245
Yeah.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.329
Well, let's go again.

31:13.789 --> 31:19.126
Well, excuse me. I know I said it
wrong, but it really don't smell manly.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.504
I mean, do you think
this stuff smells like a man?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.005
I'd say absolutely no.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.215
Are you finished?

31:24.299 --> 31:25.341
I'm sorry.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.842
Okay. Rolling again. Speed.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.261
Nice and quiet.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.388
Beast aftershave,
take two.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.556
Action!

31:31.807 --> 31:37.687
"In the morning, I splash it on and
it surrounds my face with class. "

31:37.771 --> 31:38.729
Cut!

31:39.940 --> 31:41.107
Action!

31:42.276 --> 31:46.279
"And Beast aftershave will
turn the women into beasts. "

31:46.822 --> 31:47.905
Cut!

31:48.657 --> 31:49.949
Action!

31:50.033 --> 31:54.829
"If you want to be the king of the
beasts and smell like a jungle rat... "

31:55.497 --> 31:58.541
Cat. Rat, cat.
They look a little alike.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.834
Action!

32:01.837 --> 32:06.924
"In the afternoon, when I put
it on to go out with the guys,

32:07.009 --> 32:08.676
"and have a rendezvouze... "

32:08.760 --> 32:11.887
Cut! Cut!
We're cutting this set.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.598
We're going to
the alternate set.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.099
I can get it, you know...

32:15.183 --> 32:17.602
I'm sure you can.
Will you get out of the cage?

32:17.686 --> 32:19.145
The word "rendezvous. "
Yes.

32:19.229 --> 32:22.440
Rendezvous over to the other
set, Rock, if you don't mind.

32:22.524 --> 32:23.649
Sure.

32:23.734 --> 32:24.817
We've only
wasted four hours.

32:24.901 --> 32:28.446
Arthur, Arthur, let's reorganize
here. We're going to the alternate set.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.657
You know, it sounded great inside
before it come out like that.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.284
Get the damn club
away from him

32:33.368 --> 32:35.244
and get the girls into
their other outfits.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.706
Where is the wardrobe people?
Where are the prop people?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.750
All right,
wet him down.

32:42.753 --> 32:45.463
Arthur,
step out, please.

32:45.547 --> 32:46.589
Speed.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.675
Beast aftershave,
"The Contender. " Take seven.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.053
Try to get it right.
Action!

32:52.220 --> 32:56.349
Hi. My name is Rocky Balboa,
the Italian Stallion.

32:56.433 --> 33:00.311
They say I'm the American
dream, but not 'cause...

33:01.396 --> 33:03.189
Can I do it over again?

33:03.273 --> 33:04.815
Christ! Cut.

33:04.900 --> 33:09.111
No, just keep it rolling. Keep it
rolling. Just read it off the dummy cards.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.488
Dummy cards?

33:10.572 --> 33:11.822
Please! Go on.

33:13.075 --> 33:16.869
Wait a minute. I'd like to explain
something. You know, I ain't punchy.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.288
I got what you call,
like, I don't know,

33:19.373 --> 33:21.666
a relaxed brain, but I
ain't punchy, you know.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.334
It's just
the way I talk here.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.794
What's the difference?

33:24.878 --> 33:26.837
Can you just do it
the way it's written?

33:26.922 --> 33:28.047
That ain't right.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.299
This whole thing here
ain't right, you know.

33:30.384 --> 33:31.717
What isn't right?

33:31.802 --> 33:34.679
Well, you're a rude guy. I'm trying
very hard and you're being rude.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.764
That's bad manners,
ain't it, Adrian?

33:36.848 --> 33:37.848
Yes.

33:37.933 --> 33:42.561
I'll tell you, I gotta be almost punchy
to be doing this in front of my wife.

33:42.646 --> 33:46.982
You want to quit? Then
quit! Leave! Get out of here!

33:47.067 --> 33:49.276
I didn't want you for this
setup in the first place.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.737
You have wasted,
wasted our time, sir.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.781
This is a complete bust,
the whole afternoon.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.367
Leonard. Leonard,
where are you going?

33:56.451 --> 33:58.911
I want you to take
him with you, Leonard.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.247
Take this man with you.
He is not a professional.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.499
I only work
with professionals.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.460
You cost us thousands of
dollars because you can't read.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.715
"'It's no time to cuss
me,' snarled the robber.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.677
"'By God, fellows, grab your
rifles and take color... Cover. "'

34:14.761 --> 34:15.928
How does that sound?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.013
It's good.
Yeah?

34:18.306 --> 34:21.766
You know, being a good reader's gonna
help me get a good office job, you know?

34:21.851 --> 34:23.101
Want to hear some more?

34:23.186 --> 34:24.395
I can't wait.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.148
Okay.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.900
"'There ain't no cover,
Smokey,' said Brad Lincoln.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.652
"'We better head
for the canyon. "'

34:32.737 --> 34:34.196
You read nice.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.656
Thank you.
You lie nice.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.074
Thank you.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.246
And how far did you go in
high school, Mr. Balboa?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.581
Ninth.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.831
And one last question.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.168
Do you have
a criminal record?

34:48.754 --> 34:50.963
Nothing worth
bragging about.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.219
Would you be interested
in some sort of manual labor?

34:57.512 --> 35:00.389
Well, I got nothing against
honest manual labor.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.768
It's just that I'd like to see if
I could make a living sitting down,

35:03.852 --> 35:06.729
like you're doing
over there.

35:06.813 --> 35:10.399
Can I be honest? No one's going
to offer you an office job.

35:10.484 --> 35:14.278
There's too much competition.
Why don't you fight?

35:14.362 --> 35:17.406
I've read somewhere
you're a very good fighter.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.201
Yeah? Well...

35:21.703 --> 35:24.789
Was you ever punched in the
face 500 times a night, you know?

35:24.873 --> 35:27.416
Stings after a while,
you know.

35:30.212 --> 35:33.464
Thank you very much for
your time. I appreciate it.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.476
Mr. Balboa?
Yeah.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.645
I'm very sorry.
We have nothing.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.355
Are you sure?

35:49.439 --> 35:50.481
Next.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.775
Hey, look, pal,
you gotta be realistic.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.694
You got no high school
diploma, no qualifications.

35:55.779 --> 35:59.865
Wouldn't you be more content with
a good-paying menial labor job?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.035
Thanks.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.665
The way I see it is, I can get
another job if I want to, you know?

36:07.749 --> 36:11.961
But do I want to? Do I want to be doing
something I ain't gonna be happy doing?

36:12.045 --> 36:15.047
Plus, you know, we need
the money now, Butkus.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.467
Dogs don't want to
hear my problems.

36:18.552 --> 36:19.760
Come on.

36:20.846 --> 36:25.933
Yeah. I wish I was a canine
sometimes. Give me a kiss.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.894
The only job I
got is lugging beef.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.105
You got nothing better for
Rocky than hauling beef?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.357
Hey, that's all I got, and
we're cutting back, too.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.110
So, Rocky, if you want to work,
it'd be from week to week, okay?

36:36.194 --> 36:39.071
Well, that's okay with me,
but when can I start?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.823
Well, how about
tomorrow?

36:40.907 --> 36:42.533
Well, how about today?

36:43.702 --> 36:44.743
Okay. We got
a load coming in.

36:44.828 --> 36:45.828
Great.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.788
Hey, Paulie, you look
kind of skinny there, huh.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.707
Yeah, he's losing
weight, ain't he?

36:49.791 --> 36:51.542
Don't bother to
thank me.

36:51.626 --> 36:56.213
Hey, thanks a lot, Paulie, and you don't
have to thank me for the watch, either.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.147
Quitting time!

38:21.716 --> 38:24.718
Hey, there's the best-looking
thing I seen all day.

38:26.388 --> 38:27.680
You look tired.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.391
No, no. My face is tired. I feel okay.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.142
You want to take
a hot bath?

38:32.227 --> 38:34.353
No, come on. I feel dynamic. Honest.

38:34.437 --> 38:40.150
Hey, listen. Tomorrow... I was thinking at
work, maybe after work I'll take you out.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.487
You want to do something
nice, huh? You want to do that?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.280
I'd like to do that.
How's your stomach?

38:45.365 --> 38:47.032
All right.
You all right?

38:47.117 --> 38:49.535
You look great.
Do you know that?

39:44.257 --> 39:46.467
Hey, Rock, they just like old friends.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.385
Old friends never
tasted this good.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.054
I heard that.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.565
Yo!

40:01.900 --> 40:03.150
Yo, Rock!

40:05.153 --> 40:07.029
You wanted me, Frank?

40:07.280 --> 40:08.989
I gotta let you go.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.120
How come? I'm working
hard. I'm doing good.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.581
Yeah, real good, but we
gotta cut back on manpower

40:17.665 --> 40:21.126
and you ain't got enough
time in, you know? Seniority.

40:23.004 --> 40:26.131
How about if I take
a cut in pay, all right?

40:26.257 --> 40:28.342
Can't do it. Union rules.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.470
Union rules.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.351
Can I finish out
the day?

40:37.435 --> 40:38.519
Sure.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.522
Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.108
Yeah, me, too.

40:52.325 --> 40:55.494
You got more stories than
a book, you know that?

40:55.578 --> 40:58.789
There's my brother-in-law,
Rocky. Give me the five.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.084
My brother-in-law
come to visit me.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.712
How you doing? How's everything
been? How's business? Okay?

41:05.797 --> 41:06.880
Yeah.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.507
Looking over your
old stomping ground?

41:08.591 --> 41:09.633
Yeah.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.511
Listen, Paulie, you want
to buy this car, you know.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.846
I thought
you liked it.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.347
It's okay, but I don't
need it no more.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.100
You know, I have a hard time making
these right turns with my bad eye.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.103
Keep hitting trash cans
and things like that.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.272
You got problems at home?
You need bread?

41:23.356 --> 41:24.731
No, no, everything's okay.
You know,

41:24.816 --> 41:28.026
this car would look great wrapped
around you, you know. Wouldn't it?

41:28.111 --> 41:31.321
Look, you need a hand-out,
I'll give you a hand-out.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.407
No, I don't need
no hand-out, Paulie.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.326
Look, you want
to buy the car?

41:36.411 --> 41:39.663
Sure. Why don't you be
smart and fight again?

41:42.584 --> 41:45.669
That's okay. I don't need to fight no
more. Listen, you want to buy the car?

41:45.753 --> 41:48.213
You want to pick up the
payments and all of that?

41:48.298 --> 41:49.923
Is my sister giving you
a hard time?

41:50.091 --> 41:51.925
You know, if she is,
you break her teeth.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.637
I appreciate the advice,
Paulie,

41:55.722 --> 41:57.848
but I kind of like her teeth,
you know, where they are.

41:57.932 --> 42:01.768
Okay? Here you go.
You bought yourself a car.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.607
Good car, you know. Gotta buckle
up for safety and all that.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.611
Where you going?
You need a lift?

42:11.988 --> 42:13.071
Nah.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.074
See you around.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.001
Hey,
say hi to my sister for me!

42:28.254 --> 42:31.632
Hey, listen, if you two
need the car, just ask!

42:44.729 --> 42:47.481
When did you get home?
I thought you were at work.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.317
No, I ain't at work
no more. I got...

42:51.986 --> 42:53.695
I got canned today.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.824
What happened?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.159
I don't know.
I was...

42:59.827 --> 43:02.329
You know, it's nobody's fault. They
were just cutting back, you know.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.664
It was economics.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.416
What are you gonna do?

43:06.501 --> 43:08.377
I don't know. I was

43:09.003 --> 43:11.004
thinking about fighting.

43:12.924 --> 43:16.260
What about your eye, you know? The
doctor said you shouldn't fight anymore.

43:16.344 --> 43:21.556
No, no. He recommended I don't
fight, and I recommend that I do.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.433
You'll go blind.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.936
Nobody's going blind.
Honest, I see great, you know.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.939
I see like a beagle
or something like that.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.860
You could be whatever you want to
be. You don't have to fight anymore.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.740
You know, I am a fighter, not
too good, but that's what I do.

43:39.701 --> 43:43.287
Oh, Rocky, you gave me your
word you wouldn't fight anymore.

43:43.371 --> 43:46.373
I mean, if we need money,
I could get a job.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.296
You don't have to do that.

43:53.756 --> 43:59.553
Oh, sure. I can get my job back,
you know, part-time, at the pet shop.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.979
But I'm the one
who's supposed to support.

44:10.023 --> 44:12.232
It's just for a little while.

44:15.445 --> 44:18.530
Listen, what if you catch some
pet shop disease or something?

44:18.614 --> 44:23.076
There are no pet shop diseases,
Rocky. I mean, really, I want to work.

44:24.912 --> 44:26.955
Do you really
want to do it?

44:28.541 --> 44:32.044
Yeah. We need the money.
It'll come in handy.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.759
Well, maybe you're right,
you know.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.803
You know what's best,
you know.

44:48.186 --> 44:50.187
Could you start dinner? I'm
starting to get a little hungry.

44:50.271 --> 44:52.856
I just want to finish
my workout here, okay?

44:52.940 --> 44:54.024
Sure.

45:17.006 --> 45:18.131
Jesus.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.098
Who the hell is that?

46:10.268 --> 46:12.227
Avon lady.

46:12.311 --> 46:14.187
Is that Rocky?

46:14.564 --> 46:18.400
Hey! I don't remember
giving you no key.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.778
Come on up here. Well,
the prodigal son returns!

46:21.863 --> 46:23.655
You don't look so bad,
do you, kid?

46:23.739 --> 46:26.116
What's that, an outer
space monster you brought?

46:26.200 --> 46:30.120
No, that's Butkus, my large dog.
What's that in your ear there?

46:30.204 --> 46:33.582
Oh, this? I hear
stupid things better.

46:34.292 --> 46:37.335
Well, now, did you come here
to show me that dog?

46:37.420 --> 46:40.505
No. Mick, can I have
my locker back?

46:40.590 --> 46:41.923
Yeah.
What's on your mind?

46:42.008 --> 46:43.008
Fighting.

46:43.593 --> 46:46.428
Fighting? What?
You want to go blind?

46:46.762 --> 46:48.138
Nobody's going blind.

46:48.222 --> 46:49.514
You heard what I said?

46:49.599 --> 46:52.184
Yeah, and the eye's great. No problem.

46:52.268 --> 46:55.312
Now, listen, every pug thinks
he has one good one left.

46:55.396 --> 46:58.773
Now forget it, 'cause your
fighting career is over, kid.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.317
Is that right?

47:00.401 --> 47:01.401
Yeah, I think
that's right.

47:01.486 --> 47:03.153
You know, I spend my whole
life getting a career.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.822
I get one, and you tell me it's over.

47:05.907 --> 47:08.450
What's the matter here?
You shook the hell out of

47:08.534 --> 47:10.410
the champion of
the whole wide world.

47:10.495 --> 47:11.828
You be happy with that.

47:11.913 --> 47:13.580
Well, maybe we can
do better this time.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.040
Or worse.
What about that?

47:15.124 --> 47:16.500
Hey, yo, Mick.

47:16.876 --> 47:21.087
I done you a favor last time, you
know. Can you do me one this time?

47:22.882 --> 47:24.883
I don't know.
You don't understand me.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.177
Now, look, I want to
show you something now.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.971
Test you. Now, look,
you look right there

47:30.097 --> 47:31.723
at the end of my nose, will you? Okay.

47:31.807 --> 47:32.891
I want to test you.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.017
Look at your nose.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.185
You look at my nose now.

47:35.269 --> 47:36.937
When I bring my finger in,
you tell me when you see it,

47:37.021 --> 47:38.647
will you?
Okay.

47:38.731 --> 47:40.023
There's the little thing.
I see it.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.233
That's good.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.859
I told you. It's okay.

47:42.944 --> 47:45.362
Now, wait.
Now we'll try the other lamp.

47:45.446 --> 47:48.198
Now, look here, will you?
Now, tell me.

47:52.286 --> 47:53.411
I see it.

47:53.496 --> 47:54.621
No, you see nothing.

47:54.705 --> 47:59.251
Creed would have caved in the whole
side of your face. Now, forget it, kid.

47:59.335 --> 48:03.672
You got the heart, but you ain't got
the tools no more. Now, forget it!

48:05.174 --> 48:06.216
Is that right?

48:06.300 --> 48:07.342
That is right.

48:07.426 --> 48:11.304
Yeah? Well, maybe it's you who
ain't got it no more, you know that?

48:11.389 --> 48:13.765
Yeah. Yeah. That's it.

48:17.436 --> 48:22.315
Now, look, you didn't even
see that coming, did you? No.

48:22.400 --> 48:26.027
Well, that was from
a broken-down pug like me.

48:26.112 --> 48:28.947
What do you think the champ
would do to you?

48:35.329 --> 48:37.289
I don't know.
Hurt me bad.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.833
No. He'd hurt you permanent.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.251
Permanent.

48:43.963 --> 48:45.755
You know, Mick, if...

48:48.676 --> 48:54.180
If I can't fight no more, maybe I
can help out around here, you know.

48:54.849 --> 48:58.310
Here? Well, sure, but...

48:58.436 --> 49:01.563
You know, you're
like royalty here, kid.

49:01.647 --> 49:05.025
You want those guys to see you
carrying towels and buckets around?

49:05.109 --> 49:06.901
Where's your dignity?

49:09.280 --> 49:11.990
I don't know how to
say this. I just...

49:14.243 --> 49:16.036
I gotta be around it.

49:23.169 --> 49:27.213
All right, kid.
Will you come back tomorrow?

49:32.511 --> 49:34.220
Thanks a lot, Mick.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.162
Look, I don't know
about anybody else,

49:59.246 --> 50:00.830
but as long as I'm gonna be
promoting this fight myself,

50:00.915 --> 50:03.291
I want a lot more pressure
put on for a rematch.

50:03.376 --> 50:07.253
Hey, we can get the same money
for the two top contenders.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.547
Why go after Balboa?
Why?

50:09.632 --> 50:12.842
Because there's still a lot of
people out there that think he won.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.804
There's a lot of people out there
accusing me of having the fight fixed,

50:15.888 --> 50:16.888
accusing me of being a fake,

50:16.972 --> 50:19.349
and insulting my kids
at school. That's why.

50:19.433 --> 50:20.517
You want to hear the truth?

50:20.601 --> 50:21.643
Yeah,
I want to hear the truth.

50:21.727 --> 50:24.979
The truth is that last time
he was damn lucky.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.232
Now he's all finished.

50:27.316 --> 50:30.360
I mean, he's been hanging around
doing nothing for six months.

50:30.444 --> 50:34.072
And any trainer worth anything
wouldn't have nothing to do with him.

50:34.156 --> 50:37.659
Now, I say, let's go after
some new meat.

50:37.743 --> 50:39.327
Forget this bum.

50:40.663 --> 50:43.665
Do you think I beat him
the last time? Do you?

50:45.418 --> 50:46.626
You got the decision.

50:46.711 --> 50:49.045
Man, I won,
but I didn't beat him!

50:50.798 --> 50:52.966
What are you afraid of, Tony?

50:54.468 --> 50:56.344
Honest?
Yeah, honest.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.604
He's all wrong for us,
baby.

51:07.523 --> 51:12.569
I saw you beat that man like I
never saw no man get beat before,

51:13.028 --> 51:16.656
and the man kept
coming after you.

51:18.367 --> 51:21.286
Now, we don't need that
kind of man in our life.

51:24.331 --> 51:26.458
I know what you're feeling.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.335
Let it go.

51:31.672 --> 51:32.964
Let it go.

51:34.008 --> 51:35.633
You're the champ.

51:39.346 --> 51:43.767
Thank you. Look, you're in charge
of my public relations, right?

51:43.851 --> 51:45.393
I want a whole new
campaign started.

51:45.478 --> 51:47.979
I want something done
publicly to bring this man out.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.773
I want something done
to jar this man's pride.

51:49.857 --> 51:52.692
I want something done to get
the people around him talking.

51:52.777 --> 51:54.110
All right?
You realize

51:54.195 --> 51:58.865
if we use this humiliation tactic,
you're setting yourself up as the bad guy.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.409
Look, man, whatever
gets him in the ring.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.728
What's happening?
Hey.

52:29.688 --> 52:31.648
What?
Where's your heart?

52:31.732 --> 52:33.107
What are you
talking about?

52:33.192 --> 52:34.484
You heard me.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.236
Well, what's this?

52:45.830 --> 52:48.248
It's kind of funny,
don't you think?

53:16.068 --> 53:18.611
Hey, hey, Chico,
listen. Hey, hey, listen.

53:18.696 --> 53:21.573
What's with the grin? How'd
you get so happy with yourself?

53:21.657 --> 53:24.701
Let me tell you something.
Snarl more, you see.

53:24.785 --> 53:29.205
Now, a good snarl can give you what
the Bible calls a psychological edge,

53:29.290 --> 53:33.376
because you snarl on your
punches. Wait a minute. Hey, Rock!

53:33.460 --> 53:38.381
Rock, come here a minute. Show this
Latin lamebrain how to snarl and punch.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.091
Show him that.

53:42.636 --> 53:45.763
That's it, you see. That's
ugly! That's a snarl.

53:46.265 --> 53:50.143
Hey, John, will you empty them buckets?
They're flowing over. Will you do that?

53:50.227 --> 53:51.686
Hey, Johnny, I'll do it.
No, let him do it.

53:51.770 --> 53:52.979
I got it, Rock.
Come on, I don't mind.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.105
Hey, Rock...

54:00.529 --> 54:02.280
Hey, wait a minute.

54:05.075 --> 54:06.701
Now you can
take it.

54:06.785 --> 54:07.994
Whoops.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.537
Hey!

54:09.622 --> 54:12.498
Can't you think of anything
tougher to say than, "Whoops"?

54:13.167 --> 54:15.126
Come on,
hit that right.

54:20.382 --> 54:23.343
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

54:27.932 --> 54:29.766
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.025
Yo, Rock.

54:40.819 --> 54:42.904
Yo, Tony.
How you doing?

54:42.988 --> 54:45.239
How am I doing?
No, how are you doing?

54:45.324 --> 54:46.866
Look, I heard you was
working in this dump.

54:46.951 --> 54:48.952
Now what are you doing, huh?
Give it to me straight, brother.

54:49.036 --> 54:52.121
Oh, you know, I'm sweeping up,
making a few bucks here and there.

54:52.206 --> 54:56.292
You ain't no janitor, Rock. You don't need
a job like this. Besides, you're Italian.

54:56.377 --> 54:58.002
Now you come back
and work for me, Rock.

54:58.087 --> 54:59.754
Yeah, well,
what would I be doing?

54:59.838 --> 55:04.217
You mean, like, you know,
like collecting or something?

55:04.468 --> 55:07.971
Well, what else? Look, you come back.
You work on the docks, get some fresh air.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.347
It stinks in here.

55:09.431 --> 55:12.475
Yo, Tony,
I appreciate the offer, but...

55:13.268 --> 55:15.353
I can't do that
stuff no more.

55:15.437 --> 55:16.646
It's healthy, huh?

55:17.356 --> 55:20.066
Now, look, I gotta go.
Take it easy, huh, champ?

55:20.150 --> 55:22.944
Yeah. See you around.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.114
Remember that guy,
Rock?

55:47.970 --> 55:48.970
Yo!

55:50.097 --> 55:51.931
How's everybody in
the clubhouse tonight?

55:52.016 --> 55:53.599
Oh, fine.
How'd your day go?

55:53.684 --> 55:55.309
A million laughs.
You know, it was great.

55:55.436 --> 55:57.061
You need some help with that? Yes.

55:57.146 --> 55:58.855
Yes. Okay.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.106
Hey, you know, Adrian,
I was thinking

56:00.190 --> 56:02.483
maybe you ought to stay home
and rest your stomach, you know.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.861
Come on, Rock, it's just
part-time. We need the money.

56:04.945 --> 56:07.363
Yeah, well,
maybe you're right.

56:08.615 --> 56:10.033
There we go.

56:11.452 --> 56:13.703
That ain't my brand.
I like oatmeal.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.747
Hey, listen, why don't
we forget all this work?

56:15.831 --> 56:17.582
Listen, you want to
come home with me now,

56:17.666 --> 56:19.542
and maybe I'll tell you a
few jokes on the way home,

56:19.626 --> 56:21.544
and maybe you'll laugh,
you know?

56:22.129 --> 56:25.381
We need a few laughs in our
life. What do you think? Maybe?

56:25.466 --> 56:26.591
Yes.
Maybe?

56:26.675 --> 56:30.011
Maybe. Maybe? Okay.
Let's get out of here, okay?

56:30.095 --> 56:31.888
Okay.
Here we go.

56:31.972 --> 56:33.389
Hey, listen, Adrian.
Yeah.

56:33.474 --> 56:36.309
Listen to this one.
Why do cows wear bells?

56:37.227 --> 56:38.394
Why?

56:38.479 --> 56:39.645
'Cause their
horns don't work.

56:40.314 --> 56:42.231
Is that killing you?
No?

56:43.650 --> 56:44.650
Oh, God!

56:44.735 --> 56:46.235
They really used to
like it in third grade.

56:46.320 --> 56:50.198
I used to break everybody
up with that one.

56:52.534 --> 56:53.534
Yo!

56:54.995 --> 56:57.080
You really sweep good, man!

56:58.332 --> 57:00.666
Is he talking to you?

57:00.751 --> 57:04.545
Nah, he probably has me mixed
up with somebody else. Come on.

57:06.924 --> 57:08.508
Italian chicken.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.179
Boy,
you guys got the easy life.

57:13.847 --> 57:17.809
Hey, how you guys doing? Did
anybody move today, you know, huh?

57:17.893 --> 57:21.604
How's life in the bowl? You
gotta exercise once in a while.

57:22.231 --> 57:25.233
Would you like a little snacklet
or something? Here you go.

57:25.317 --> 57:28.861
Come on, Cuff. Hey, Link,
what, you drowning down there?

57:29.363 --> 57:33.199
Hey, want to hear some TV?
Want to hear some TV?

57:36.245 --> 57:40.456
The Los Angeles Rams. The Rams
defeated the Buccaneers in overtime,

57:40.541 --> 57:42.542
13 to 10, on Frank
Corell's 45-yard field goal.

57:42.626 --> 57:45.545
Hey, Butkus. Come here,
Butkus. Come here, boy.

57:47.172 --> 57:49.173
What did you do today,
huh?

57:50.134 --> 57:51.884
Did you bark at
anybody today?

57:51.969 --> 57:56.597
Yo, Adrian! Sometimes I look at Butkus
and I don't think he's a normal canine.

57:57.349 --> 57:58.349
Well, what do you
think he is?

57:58.433 --> 57:59.433
I don't know.

57:59.518 --> 58:02.019
He just don't look like a
regular dog to me sometimes,

58:02.104 --> 58:03.938
you know, when I look
inside there.

58:04.022 --> 58:07.942
Earlier today I was down at
Apollo Creed's palatial gym,

58:08.026 --> 58:12.905
and, as usual, the world champion was not
at a loss for words about Rocky Balboa.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.700
Look, I know a lot of people out
there want to see me in a rematch

58:15.784 --> 58:18.828
with a timid fellow who calls
himself the Italian Stallion.

58:18.912 --> 58:21.789
But this man does not have the honor to
meet me in the ring. Or is it Scallion?

58:21.915 --> 58:23.499
Now, listen, in fairness,
Apollo... What's his name?

58:23.584 --> 58:24.834
What is your name?

58:24.918 --> 58:26.085
...Rocky Balboa did
officially retire.

58:26.170 --> 58:29.005
Yeah. The bum's hiding. The bum's
running. He doesn't want to face me.

58:29.089 --> 58:30.423
He's scared.
You know it and I know it.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.508
Apollo, I think there's
more here than meets the eye.

58:32.593 --> 58:36.012
You've been under close scrutiny ever
since that split-decision victory.

58:36.096 --> 58:39.682
A lot of reporters, Apollo, including
me, thought it was an even draw.

58:39.766 --> 58:41.517
That's your opinion
and you're entitled to it.

58:41.602 --> 58:43.519
But now I'm ready
to have a rematch,

58:43.604 --> 58:46.522
to prove that this lucky club
fighter, and that's what he was, lucky,

58:46.607 --> 58:48.065
does not have the skill

58:48.150 --> 58:51.402
to last five minutes in the ring
with a superior athlete like me.

58:51.486 --> 58:54.447
The man's running, the man's hiding.
The man doesn't want to face me.

58:54.531 --> 58:57.366
So I say to you, Rocky Balboa,
or whatever your name is,

58:57.451 --> 58:58.868
that I want
the American people to know,

58:58.952 --> 59:00.369
I want
the whole world to know,

59:00.454 --> 59:02.455
that I'm ready, willing, and
able to meet you anywhere.

59:02.539 --> 59:05.541
Any place, any time, I will meet
and defeat this so-called fighter,

59:05.626 --> 59:07.668
who calls himself
the Italian Stallion,

59:07.753 --> 59:09.378
if the man only has the guts
to give me a call.

59:09.463 --> 59:12.423
And you can call me collect.
Call me, Balboa!

59:13.258 --> 59:16.427
This would be a legitimate rematch,
the boxer against the puncher,

59:16.511 --> 59:19.680
and I think everyone wants to see
them back in the ring together.

59:19.765 --> 59:23.351
But there's only one problem,
where is Rocky Balboa?

59:24.561 --> 59:25.811
Ugly bum!

59:34.488 --> 59:36.822
You know,
I was thinking that

59:37.991 --> 59:40.743
I ain't supposed to
do no commercials and

59:40.827 --> 59:43.621
I ain't supposed to
work in no meat house.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.290
I'm supposed to be
a fighter.

59:47.084 --> 59:48.876
But you gave that up.

59:49.962 --> 59:51.087
Yeah.

59:52.005 --> 59:54.799
I think I'm becoming
a nobody again, too.

59:55.133 --> 59:57.093
In whose eyes?
Not mine.

59:57.177 --> 59:58.511
In mine.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:00.846
In here.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:04.934
We'll get by.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.102
That's just it.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.107
I don't want you to get by
the hard way, you know?

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.942
I want you to have
good things.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.319
I want the kid to
have good things.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.946
We'll have them.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.950
I just think we need
them now, don't you?

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.786
Rocky, please...

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.248
You don't have
to prove anything.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.876
Adrian, it's all I know.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.505
I don't want you to do it.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.925
It's all I know.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:42.638
Adrian?

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:46.434
You know,

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:52.356
I never asked you to stop
being a woman, you know?

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:58.446
Please, I'm asking you, please,
don't ask me to stop being a man.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:00.531
Please.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:34.357
I think we ought to
knock his block off.

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:35.524
Absolutely.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:36.734
Rocky.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:41.489
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.123
Well...
Let's do it.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:57.213
Apollo! Has a site been
chosen for the rematch?

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.715
This fight will be held in
the Philadelphia Spectrum,

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.051
'cause I want this man's
hometown to see this.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:05.054
I want all of Philadelphia,
I want all of America,

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:08.891
I want the whole world to see me
destroy this man after two short rounds.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.017
Because after this fight,

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:12.520
he's gonna have to donate what's
gonna be left of his body to science.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:14.605
But there won't be much.
That I can guarantee you.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:19.068
Rocky, what do you think about the
fight taking place in the Spectrum?

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.694
Well, I'm very happy
about that.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:21.904
Why?

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:24.865
Well, it's only about 10 minutes
from my house, the Spectrum.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.827
Apollo, a lot of people say
that you lost the first fight,

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.703
a victim of
the southpaw jinx.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.414
Did fighting a
left-hander throw you off?

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.082
Southpaw jinx nothing!

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:36.502
Last time, I took the fight too lightly,
and this man was just plain lucky.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:40.172
But this time... This time you
all will see the real Apollo Creed.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.591
The world is gonna see
the real Apollo Creed.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:46.595
Lightning fast and hard to catch.
No playing, no jiving, just business.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.222
All right. Looks like
he's got a good chance.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:53.269
Rocky, do you think you have a
chance this time against Apollo?

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.896
I don't know.
He looks pretty mad.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.442
Me and Mick,
we're gonna try our best.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.902
His lungs he's
gonna punch out.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.904
Now, who's that?
Al Capone?

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.406
I wouldn't sweat you.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:10.119
Look here, look here, a lot of people
may not like me, and that's okay.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:14.165
But come November, Apollo Creed will
provide the ultimate gala spectacle,

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:17.501
on Thanksgiving, in front
of this man's home crowd.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.837
I'm gonna drop him
like a bad habit.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.964
Rocky, your pay for the
fight is very substantial.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:24.300
What are you gonna
do with the money?

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:28.679
Well, the first thing I gotta do
is I gotta pay the rent, you know.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.682
And then, well, I made
this list on the way over.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:32.975
I was just thinking
of things to do.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.312
I'd like to get a couple
of hats, and a motorcycle,

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:40.274
and a couple of quarts of perfume
for Adrian. She likes to smell good.

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:44.987
And some Muppet toys. You know,
Ernie and Big Bird and that frog.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:47.198
What's his name?
Kermit or something?

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.824
I don't know.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.911
And I thought maybe
a statue for the church,

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.497
and I think a snow cone
machine for you, Paulie.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.207
You like snow cones,
don't you?

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.333
Yeah.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:00.961
Rocky, got anything derogatory
to say about the champ?

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.923
"Derogatory"?
Yeah. He's great.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.008
How about some clowning shots, Apollo?

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.343
Yeah.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:10.262
Does this look like
a circus to you, man?

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.724
Come November,
you're mine.

01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:17.853
He's very upset.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.146
Well...

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.070
See how smooth
he moves there?

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.030
See how he pumps
that jab into your eye?

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.323
Yeah.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:33.160
You got guts to go back
in the ring with him, kid.

01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:35.204
Thanks a lot, Mick.

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:39.792
Your style's too
easy to figure out.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.211
I mean, left-handed fighters
they're the worst, you know.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.129
They lead with
their face mostly.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:47.758
Trying to throw that big
left. Right's no damn good.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.970
They ought to
outlaw southpaws.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.389
Yeah, why didn't you
tell me this before?

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:56.475
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings. Now, look.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:01.647
To pull this miracle off,
you gotta change everything.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.899
You gotta learn to be
a right-handed fighter.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:07.945
Now, this will confuse Apollo,
and it'll protect that bad eye.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.657
I can't learn how to
fight right-handed no more.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:16.078
What's "can't"? There ain't no
"can'ts"! There's no "can'ts. "

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.748
Now, he will beat you uglier
than you are now.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.418
Now, listen, you start
fighting right-handed,

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.128
and then you change
suddenly,

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.715
and that'll make history,
but first you gotta get speed.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:33.721
Demon speed. Speed's what we
need. We need greasy, fast speed!

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.683
Now, I'll show you a trick how
to get some speed in them legs.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.727
Do you have to wear
that stinking sweatshirt?

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.312
Well, it brings me luck,
you know.

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:43.272
You know what it brings?
It brings flies.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.149
Now, listen, I want you
to try... Listen to me.

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:48.485
I want you to try to
chase this little chicken.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.363
Well, what do I gotta chase a chicken
for? It's embarrassing, you know.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.282
First,
because I said so.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:57.036
And second, because chicken-chasing
is how we always used to train

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.203
in the old days.
Yeah.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:01.457
You catch this thing, you can
catch greased lightning. Ready?

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.793
Yeah, well, I'd rather eat it than chase it.
It ain't very mature. Well, if you say so.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:08.297
Well, neither are you very mature!
Now, listen, get this thing.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.673
I'm a fighter.
I ain't a farmer.

01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:11.884
Come on at it!
Go on and get him!

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:16.513
Get him! Get him! Get him! Come on!
What's the matter with you? Get him!

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:19.224
Pick him up!
Pick him up!

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.101
Pull him round!

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.188
What's the matter?
You're so fast.

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:26.815
Are you standing still or
something? Speed! Speed!

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.610
Can't you catch
a little chicken?

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:33.280
Come on! Move your tail!
Move your tail!

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:36.367
You look like a girl out there.
What's the matter with you?

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:38.744
I feel like
a Kentucky fried idiot.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:44.375
Wake up, will you? Would you wake up?
Come on. Come on. Give it. Give it.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:47.252
Yo, Rock. What's the matter
with my sister?

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.296
Well, boy, I wish you'd go talk to her.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:52.007
You know, Adrian don't like this none.
She's started crying and everything.

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:53.050
She don't like
me fighting.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:55.511
What's with this
domestic stuff?

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:59.181
Tend to the business, will
you? Jab that till it hurts!

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:03.018
Five hundred times without
stopping. Do you hear me? 500 times.

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.770
Hey, Mick, I want to use my other arm.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.480
If you do,
I'm gonna chop it off.

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:07.731
Is that clear?

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:08.982
I'll figure something.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.819
Yeah, I wish you would, Paulie.
I appreciate it, you know.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.821
I'm sorry. Are you finished? Yeah.

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.240
Can we go to work?
That would be nice.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:20.577
Now, hit that bag. Hit it.
Jab it till it hurts. Go ahead.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.037
Three, four...

01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:25.833
Yeah, I want
500 high ones. Go!

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.376
Where was I?
Seven or eight?

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:34.049
One, two. One, two. One,
two. Come on. Turn it over.

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:39.805
Come on. Snap it. Come
on. Come on. Dig! Dig! Dig!

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.557
All right,
pick it up.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:47.730
Come on. Pick them up. Pick
them up. Faster! Faster! Faster!

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.815
Come on!
Faster!

01:07:57.699 --> 01:07:58.991
Time!

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:05.998
Time!

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:14.548
Get up! Get me another one, all right?

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.134
Come on. You gotta ease up
on these sparring partners.

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:18.385
You just get me another,
man.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:30.354
Time! What's the matter?
That bag too fast for you?

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.118
You're gonna pound that
sass right out of him.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:47.747
Last time we should have won, but
this time you're gonna be scary, kid.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:51.877
You're gonna be a greasy,
fast, Italian monster!

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.754
You're gonna eat lightning!

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.589
You're gonna crap thunder!

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:58.509
We'll have to put
you in a cage, kid.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.345
Let's take a break,
Mick, all right?

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.096
Break? What break?

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.390
Where are you going?
We're not finished.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.977
Hey, I said where
the hell you going?

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.104
I'm talking to myself.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.894
Speed! Speed!

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:53.145
Catch that punk!

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:57.860
Speed, damn it, speed! Can't
you catch that little squirt?

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:01.488
Can't you? Get off your
rear! Get the lead out!

01:10:01.573 --> 01:10:03.407
Move. Move! Fast!

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:07.119
You look dead out there. If you
can catch that little speedball,

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.371
you're gonna
catch Creed easy.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.373
Come on! Move! Move!

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:13.542
All right. Time!

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:16.128
Hey, dead ass.
Get over here.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.632
Hey, you sick, kid?

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:24.303
Kid, what's the matter
with you?

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:25.804
Nothing.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.890
Let me tell you
something, kid.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.475
Now, for a 45-minute fight,

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:34.897
you gotta train hard
for 45,000 minutes.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:40.485
Forty-five thousand. That's 10 weeks.
That's 10 hours a day. You listening?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.071
And you ain't
even trained one.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:46.950
I don't know what the hell you're
waiting for. What are you waiting for?

01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:49.077
I don't know.

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:51.163
Suit yourself.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.416
Yo, Rocky.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.919
Hey, yo, Paulie.
How you doing?

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.462
I'm worried about you.
I've been watching.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:10:59.588
What?

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.673
Your head ain't
screwed on right.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.801
Nah, come on. I'm doing okay.
You know, I've been thinking.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.762
You know, would you like
to work my corner?

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:09.264
Want to get involved
in this fight, you know?

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:11.683
Get involved in what?
Watching you get murdered?

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.518
Oh, come on.
I'm doing okay.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:17.022
Come on. My sister got you so guilty,
you're running all over the place.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.357
She'll be all right.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.608
It ain't all right.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.985
Hey, Paulie, it's okay,
all right?

01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:23.445
It's not okay.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.697
Just leave Adrian alone,
all right?

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.044
Hey, kid,
carry this, will you?

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.631
Because I liked you better
when you was carrying spit.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.132
What's that supposed
to mean?

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.259
It means that you're training
like a ninth-rate pug

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:47.970
who ought to be pumping gas
in Jersey someplace.

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:50.430
Yeah? Yeah, that's what it means.

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:52.432
I think I'm gonna go
take a shower, Mick.

01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:54.393
That's a good idea.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:57.854
Soak your head someplace.
Soak it good.

01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:08.699
Yo, Adrian! Where are you?

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:09.992
Paulie.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.494
Yeah, Paulie.
What the hell you doing?

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:13.704
What do you mean?

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:14.871
What the hell you doing?

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:16.707
About what?

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.792
About messing up
that guy over there.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.921
Don't start with me, Paulie.
I'm just trying to keep him safe.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.799
Yeah, what? Feeding
these goddamn squirrels?

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:29.344
Did I teach you how to do that?
Ditching the guy when he needs your help?

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:31.013
I can't believe
my ears.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.681
You didn't teach
me anything, Paulie.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.850
You didn't teach me anything,
and I never hurt Rocky.

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.810
You're messing up his brain
real bad. You know that?

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:37.936
That's not what I'm doing.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:39.104
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.230
Yeah, don't tell me!

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.190
He's gonna get
hurt because of you!

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:43.358
It's not true.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:44.526
Don't say that!

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:45.694
I'm saying it.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.070
Come across and tell
him it's all right.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:48.405
It's not all right,
Paulie.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:52.492
If he goes blind, you walk away.
I can't. I love him. You don't!

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.709
What are you doing?

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:04.963
What are you doing? What's
wrong? Adrian, what's the matter?

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.219
Come on.
Where are your guts?

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.263
What's your problem,
Mick?

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.223
My problem?
Yeah.

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:19.061
You got the problem, kid.
You got a ticker problem.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.813
What's the matter? You
got nothing left inside?

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:25.650
'Cause you're training like
a damn bum, you know that?

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.736
Bum?
A bum.

01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:32.240
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ain't got it no more.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:37.079
All right. Then don't you waste
my time no more. You hear that?

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:40.165
Go away! Go back to the
docks where you belong.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.752
You go back to
being a two-bit nothing!

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:49.091
But don't you ever come back here again,
because I'm too old to waste my time

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:52.511
trying to train a no-good
loser like you, you bum!

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.179
Hey, Rock, they want
you across the street.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.140
What's the matter?
Your wife's sick.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.944
Mr. Balboa?
I'm Dr. Cooper.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:12.030
The baby is fine, even
though it's a month premature.

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.032
What is it?
It's a boy.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.951
Holy smoke. I didn't
know she could do it.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.703
Yeah, well, how is
Adrian? Where is Adrian?

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.123
She's had complications.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.292
Like what?

01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.795
Your wife was hemorrhaging
when she was brought in.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:31.299
The premature delivery was most
likely caused by straining or overwork,

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:35.554
and the sudden loss of blood has
caused her to slip into a coma.

01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:07.586
Adrian, it's me.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.846
They said outside
you're very sick, but I...

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.099
I don't want to
believe that.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.896
Maybe you're just tired,
you know.

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:35.113
Don't worry about nothing. You just
sleep as long as you want, okay?

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:38.074
And I'm gonna be
here when you wake up.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.461
Rocky, come on. You're
not doing any good here.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:50.712
No, I can't...

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.881
Let's go see the kid.
Adrian would want it.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:55.300
No. We gotta see
him together.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.596
It's okay. We gotta
see him together.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:17.822
Mr. Balboa,
visiting hours are over.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.159
Can't I stay?
I'll be quiet.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.664
I'm sorry.
Hospital rules.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.460
I can't do any more
of this watching stuff.

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.386
Do you have a chapel?

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.305
Yes, we do.

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:52.524
Good night.

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:17.382
Rock,

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.011
it's 3:00 in the morning.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:28.143
You know that I
went up to your house.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:30.228
They told me you was here.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.982
It's 3:00 a. m., kid.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:39.571
That Adrian,
she's a good girl.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:44.659
Me, you know, I'm sorry
for both of you.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:53.710
Well, ain't nothing I can
do, is there? Except...

01:17:56.422 --> 01:18:01.968
I'd like to tell you something once,
and then I ain't gonna say it again.

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:05.263
Well, Rocky,
you got another shot.

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:09.059
It's a second shot at the...

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:13.938
I don't know, the biggest
title in the world.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.568
And you're gonna
be swapping punches

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:22.197
with the most dangerous
fighter in the world.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:28.953
And just in case, you know,
your brain ain't working so good,

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:35.085
all this happens pretty soon.
And you ain't ready.

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:39.964
You're nowhere near
in shape.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:44.344
So, I say, you know,
for God's sake,

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:48.932
why don't you stand up and fight
this guy hard, like you done before?

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:51.351
That was beautiful!

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:56.523
But don't lay down in
front of him like this!

01:18:56.607 --> 01:19:00.777
Like a... I don't know, like
some kind of mongrel or something.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:04.406
'Cause he's gonna
kick your face in pieces.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:09.369
You know that? That's right. This
guy just don't want to win, you know.

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:12.497
He wants to bury you.
He wants to humiliate you.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.582
He wants to prove
to the whole world

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:19.421
that it was nothing but some kind
of a freak the first time out.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:22.507
He said you're
a one-time lucky bum.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:29.514
Well, now, I don't...

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:36.271
I don't want to get mad
in a biblical place like this,

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:41.067
but I think you're a hell of a lot
more than that, kid. A hell of a lot.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.161
But, now, wait a minute.
If you want to blow it...

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:56.166
If you want to blow this thing,
damn it, I'm gonna blow it with you.

01:19:57.585 --> 01:20:02.505
Do you want to stay here? I'll
stay with you. I'll stay with you.

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:05.967
Yeah.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:13.099
I'll stay and pray.
What have I got to lose?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.666
It's gonna be okay.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:36.766
"There ain't no other trail to
the ranch, or no shorter one.

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:39.978
"'Oh, yes, there is,'
said Marvel.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.397
"'When I was a kid,
I helped my old man

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:46.317
"'trail some cattle
up from the border. "'

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:51.281
Can you hear me, Adrian? Keep
listening. Keep listening.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:58.371
"After breakfast, Bruce watched
the party get away on the chase.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:02.792
"He saw Cora
and Kay and Bud

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:07.005
"start up the valley 15
minutes ahead of the others.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:09.924
"At the last minute,
the girl... "

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:14.470
"Replied Olga, 'Buck Mason?
Who is he? '

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:23.062
"White pointed towards Marvel, who
was leading the horses to the corral. "

01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:40.330
Well, I just wrote this
thing for you, Adrian.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:45.668
I don't know. Maybe you'll like it.
I'll just read it to you, 'cause...

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:49.172
"Remember when we
was on ice skates,

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:52.800
"and I thought you were
supposed to be great,

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:56.638
"but I kept giving you lip
and you kept trying to slip,

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.265
"so I could catch you?

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:04.979
"That was our first date. And
after that every day was great.

01:23:05.064 --> 01:23:09.817
"So now I want you to know
that wherever you go,

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:15.907
"Atlantic City or in the snow,
don't worry about a thing.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:20.953
"'Cause as long as I got this ring,
I'll always be there to catch you. "

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:35.695
I knew you'd come back.

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:47.623
Thank you, God.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:56.007
Anybody want a refill? Adrian,
it costs six bucks a bottle.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.050
I don't need that.
I ain't drinking now.

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.011
So, you haven't
seen the baby?

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.596
No, come on. I was waiting
to... I've seen him.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.930
...see him together.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:07.185
Hey, the kid's a winner. He's
got forearms like him, Mickey.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.353
Here he is now. Look.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:10.688
Oh, no.

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:13.941
There's your mommy.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.109
Oh, baby!

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:20.114
Is that it?

01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:25.244
I can't believe it.
He's ours?

01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:26.329
Yeah.

01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:28.456
He's really ours?
Thank you.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.877
Come on. You done all the work.
Adrian, I can't believe you done this.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.712
Believe me, we did.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.464
Oh, no.
He ain't got a name.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.132
What do you want
to call him?

01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:40.968
Paulie's a great name.

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:43.930
Yeah,
Paulie's a pretty good name.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.765
What about after the father?

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:47.517
Rocky, Jr.?

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:48.851
Come on. You really want to do that?

01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:50.144
Yes.

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:54.065
Adrian, he's the best I ever
seen. You really done good.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.487
You look so tired. Why
don't you go get some sleep?

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:03.324
Oh, no, no. I feel great. I feel
great. Listen, I been thinking.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:06.911
If you don't want me
mixing with Creed no more,

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:10.665
we'll make out some other
kind of way, you know.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:12.625
There's one thing
I want you to do for me.

01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:14.585
What?
Come here.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:16.712
What?

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:17.964
Win.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:22.552
Win.

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:25.096
What are we waiting for?
Take us!

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.759
Faster! Faster!

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:09.765
Keep moving!
Keep moving! Faster.

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:13.019
Pick them up!
Pick them up!

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:19.775
That's it.
That's it. Yeah.

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:21.986
Speed! Speed!

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.946
Come on! Come on!

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.699
Don't be a slouch.

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:28.159
Fifty-eight, 59...

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.535
One more!
Come on, man!

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.412
Push. Push.

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:35.207
Forty-four, 45, 46.
Yeah!

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:40.004
Forty-seven,
48, 49, 50!

01:27:56.647 --> 01:28:01.400
Again! Again! Now get that out of here!

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:04.570
Come on! Push!
Don't give up!

01:28:04.655 --> 01:28:06.447
Get that olive oil
out of you!

01:28:07.658 --> 01:28:08.950
Push!

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:13.037
Twenty-seven, 28...

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.543
Forty-one, 42, 43...

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.754
Forty-six, 47...

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:24.882
Push! Push!
Again!

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.387
Left! Right!

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:40.272
Yeah! Yeah!

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:41.857
Speed!

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:48.948
Speed!
Speed! Speed!

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:13.097
Good night.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.911
Hey, Rocky!

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:52.720
Hey, Rocky!

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:54.472
Rocky, you gotta put
him down this time!

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:15.117
Come on, come on!

01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.322
I'm up!

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:51.755
Rocky! Rocky!

01:32:41.264 --> 01:32:43.891
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Bill Baldwin speaking to you

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:46.227
from the magnificent Spectrum
here in Philadelphia,

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:47.686
the site of Superfight II,

01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:49.271
with Rocky Balboa,
the challenger,

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:52.316
and of course Apollo Creed,
the world champion.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.319
My sidekick and partner
again tonight, Stu Nahan.

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:58.239
Thank you, Bill, and for those of you
who are watching tonight's telecast,

01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:02.159
we think you're gonna see a real great
battle in every sense of the word.

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:09.875
Don't worry about nothing.
It's okay.

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.381
I gotta go.

01:33:18.635 --> 01:33:22.012
Adrian, I wish the doctor
would let you go to this fight.

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:24.014
Me, too.

01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:29.103
You're the man. You're number one.
The champ. The best of all time.

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:31.772
The girls love you.
Men, old people love you.

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:34.692
Young people love you. You're
the best. You're the man.

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:37.152
And he's yours. He's yours. He's yours.

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.780
This bum shouldn't even be
in the same ring with you.

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:41.699
I want you to show him
who you are tonight.

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:44.285
Show him who you are
tonight. Stick him.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:46.328
Go, Rocky, go!

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.007
Now, listen, Paulie, you're gonna
help out with the baby tonight, right?

01:33:58.091 --> 01:33:59.133
I'll take care
of everything.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:01.468
Okay, you just take care of everything
now because you're in charge.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:04.096
I'll take care of the dumb house.
You're gonna be late for your own fight.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.681
Everything's gonna
be fine.

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:08.350
Well, maybe I'd
better go fight now.

01:34:08.435 --> 01:34:09.893
I love you.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:11.395
I love you, too.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.646
Punch his lungs out.

01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:14.315
Adrian,
I wish you could go.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:15.816
The doctor said no.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.192
I got
the doctor's instructions.

01:34:17.277 --> 01:34:19.153
Take care.
Good luck.

01:34:35.086 --> 01:34:38.130
The champion has let it be
known to the press and radio

01:34:38.214 --> 01:34:41.258
that he is in the best shape
of his illustrious career.

01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:47.473
And Rocky Balboa, I know,
is a 5-to-1 underdog.

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:50.184
I know he's still a street
brawler from Philadelphia.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:53.312
But can he repeat that incredible
performance of 10 months ago?

01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:57.524
And, you know, he took a real
beating at the hands of the champion.

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:01.028
Carmine!

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:06.200
Hey, yo, Father Carmine!
Father Carmine!

01:35:06.284 --> 01:35:08.327
Hey, Father Carmine,
are you home?

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:11.288
Father Carmine!
Hey, yo, Father Carmine!

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:14.750
It's me, Rocky Balboa.

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:16.168
Rocky?
Yeah.

01:35:19.798 --> 01:35:21.548
Oh, yeah, I'm going
to the fight right now,

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:24.551
but I was wondering if you could
do me a small favor, you know.

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:27.388
Well, it's about the fight,
you know?

01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:29.556
Now I got the family and
the baby and all that stuff.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:32.434
And I was wondering, you know, if
you could throw down a blessing,

01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:36.772
so that if I get beat up tonight, you
know, it won't be too bad, you know?

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:39.274
Could you do
something like that?

01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:47.116
Thanks a lot, Father. Listen, I
appreciate it. I gotta go. I'm so late.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.660
I'll see you in church,
I hope. Take care.

01:36:09.222 --> 01:36:10.389
Hey, Rock.

01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:11.640
Good luck, son.

01:36:11.891 --> 01:36:14.268
Yo, Mick! Run, or I'll break your head!

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.478
Where you been? You lost
your brain or something?

01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:17.771
We got a fight,
remember that?

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:19.440
I'm sorry. I'm here.

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:21.984
Get dressed, will you?
There's a million people...

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:24.403
Stu, there are many rumors
circulating about this fight.

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:28.365
Well, the most obvious being a definite
desire for Apollo to draw first blood,

01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:29.575
to end it quickly.

01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:32.911
This would prove his claim
that the last fight was a fluke.

01:36:32.996 --> 01:36:36.165
Come on, lightning hands!
Hurricane! Hurricane!

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:45.048
Get him. Get him.
I'm gonna get him.

01:36:45.175 --> 01:36:46.925
Gonna get him. Gonna get
him. He's ours! He's ours!

01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:48.218
Gonna get him.
He's ours! He's ours!

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.682
It's time, kid.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.567
Okay, let's do it.

01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:06.236
All right, I'm ready.

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:14.369
You know, I think I'm starting
to get a headache here.

01:37:14.454 --> 01:37:16.955
No, you are in
perfect working condition.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.999
You are perfect.
Yeah, you look good, too.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:21.543
Yeah, thanks. And you
look perfect. Perfect.

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:23.337
Hey, Mick. Hey, Mick.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:24.630
In case I don't get a chance,

01:37:24.714 --> 01:37:27.925
I just want to say I'm gonna be
trying hard for you today, okay?

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:29.927
Thank you.

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.595
Ain't this robe nice?

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.180
It's better than last year,
that's for sure.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:34.348
Remember that
baggy one last year?

01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:36.183
This is gorgeous.
It's perfect.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:37.726
Yeah, it's real cute.
I like it.

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:39.436
Yeah. Okay.

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:47.194
Yes, Rocky Balboa
heading toward the ring now.

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:51.198
Yes, sir. Rocky Balboa, known to
millions as the Italian Stallion,

01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:55.035
making his way to the ring. Why
this fighter of limited ability

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:58.288
has gained such popularity
is such a mystery.

01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:01.291
Rocky Balboa, and the
folks here at the Spectrum

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:03.293
are beginning to
chant his name.

01:38:03.378 --> 01:38:05.712
He has an awful
lot of backers here.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:08.507
Balboa is wearing
a black and gold robe.

01:38:08.591 --> 01:38:12.219
He wore a red one the last time
from that meat-packing plant.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:15.138
Some said that was from the high
school that he never graduated from.

01:38:15.223 --> 01:38:16.265
31 years of age.

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:19.643
There he is over shaking hands
with the referee, Lou Filippo.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:22.312
And we're waiting now for the
champion to come into the ring.

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:25.357
Rocky! Rocky!

01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:27.734
Rocky! Rocky!

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:30.112
This area is certainly packed
with Rocky's people.

01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:33.240
I've never seen so many
Italians in one place in my life!

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:34.908
Hey, hey. You said that.
I didn't say that.

01:38:34.993 --> 01:38:35.993
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky!

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:38.078
These people are for you,
Rock! I appreciate it.

01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:39.204
Are you ready
in here?

01:38:39.289 --> 01:38:40.247
I think so.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.249
Yeah, well, tonight's
our night, kid.

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:46.420
By the sound of the crowd, the champion
is just now coming into the Spectrum.

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:48.755
And the champion,
Apollo Creed.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.343
And he looks a little more determined
this time than he did the last time.

01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:55.304
It's Apollo.
Who'd you expect?

01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:57.639
I was hoping
he wouldn't show.

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:03.937
The champ
of all time!

01:39:04.022 --> 01:39:06.273
Now the champion is
climbing into the ring.

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:10.068
Very determined-looking.
Very serious right now.

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:12.112
Rocky doesn't look as
confident as he might.

01:39:12.196 --> 01:39:17.743
Apollo Creed, the master of
disaster, the best of all time!

01:39:21.414 --> 01:39:24.207
You're going down, man.
You're going down.

01:39:25.168 --> 01:39:27.252
Don't let it bother you,
kid.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:28.670
Would it bother you?

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:29.755
Yeah.

01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:32.716
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.219
and welcome to
the Philadelphia Spectrum!

01:39:38.056 --> 01:39:41.266
This is your main
event of the evening,

01:39:41.351 --> 01:39:46.355
15 rounds for the heavyweight
championship of the world!

01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:57.449
In the black corner, the
challenger, weighing 202 pounds,

01:39:57.533 --> 01:40:01.286
from the great fighting city
of Philadelphia,

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:06.875
the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa!

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:23.684
And in the red corner,
weighing 220 pounds,

01:40:23.768 --> 01:40:29.189
a champion who needs no introduction
anywhere in the civilized world,

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:32.401
the true master of disaster,

01:40:32.485 --> 01:40:36.697
the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:43.120
the one, the only,
Apollo Creed!

01:40:47.917 --> 01:40:51.336
Referee Lou Filippo
will give the instructions.

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:04.558
Okay, boys, I'm gonna give
you the instructions now,

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:06.143
and I expect you
to follow them.

01:41:06.227 --> 01:41:09.563
Watch your low punches and
watch your kidney punches.

01:41:09.647 --> 01:41:10.856
Watch your
rabbit punches.

01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:13.400
In case of a knockdown, you
go to the corner I tell you to

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:15.902
and stay there until I tell
you to come out, understand?

01:41:15.987 --> 01:41:18.572
Okay, boys. Let's have
a good fight.

01:41:20.158 --> 01:41:21.825
You're going down.

01:41:23.161 --> 01:41:24.953
You can do it, Rocky!

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:26.872
Good luck to you.

01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:29.833
He's still upset.

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.752
Who cares? Now, listen,
protect that eye.

01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:35.422
And no matter what happens, don't go
back to fighting southpaw till I tell you.

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:37.174
Now, you get him.
Okay.

01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:38.383
Good luck.

01:41:38.468 --> 01:41:39.509
Now he's gonna try
to kill you quick.

01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:42.387
If you get through this
first round, then he's ours.

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:44.473
Okay. Show him who you are.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.399
As Rocky Balboa prays in his corner,
the champion dancing over in his corner,

01:41:54.484 --> 01:41:56.902
we're just seconds away from the
fight of the century, Superfight II.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:59.321
And there's the bell.

01:42:00.698 --> 01:42:02.574
And the champion
comes over in a hurry now,

01:42:02.658 --> 01:42:04.618
and throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:06.578
He starts to take
command early here.

01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:10.499
And now, he kind of moves his feet
along the side of the ring now.

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:13.502
Rocky's holding that right
hand. He's fighting right-handed!

01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:18.048
I don't believe it. The southpaw
from Philly is fighting right-handed!

01:42:21.052 --> 01:42:34.523
Rocky! Rocky!

01:42:34.607 --> 01:42:37.651
Break that damn jab!
Protect that eye!

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.405
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:43.865
Break it up there.

01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:45.158
You ain't got nothing.

01:42:45.243 --> 01:42:46.451
Break it up.

01:42:46.577 --> 01:42:47.994
You ready to
lay down?

01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:50.872
A good right hand followed by
another right and another right

01:42:50.957 --> 01:42:52.082
thrown by the champion.

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:55.001
Three good right
hands bang at Balboa.

01:42:55.086 --> 01:42:57.003
They're in the corner,
and there's left to right.

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:59.005
Here comes Balboa
coming back at him.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:01.842
A left and a right to the head,
and now back off of the ropes.

01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:03.677
Balboa appears to
be getting hit often,

01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:06.555
but he seems to be
in pretty good condition.

01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:09.599
A hard right hand thrown by
the champion. Another right.

01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:12.394
Balboa is in trouble now.
He's in trouble.

01:43:12.478 --> 01:43:16.022
Taking rights and lefts as
the champion begins to open up.

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:19.150
It was a tremendous
right hand. Balboa is down!

01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:21.236
Down goes Balboa!

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:23.321
Get back.

01:43:23.573 --> 01:43:27.409
We see Apollo hit that bad left
eye, remember, from the first fight.

01:43:27.493 --> 01:43:30.620
That's the eye that was cut the last
time. Balboa getting up rather unsteadily.

01:43:30.705 --> 01:43:31.872
Go get him!

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:34.207
Go after him, kid!
Go after him!

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:35.292
Yeah.

01:43:36.752 --> 01:43:40.255
And the champion starts to move
in again. Going right, left.

01:43:40.339 --> 01:43:44.718
He's taking those punches pretty well.
And now Balboa just comes right back!

01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:46.469
Tossed the ref right
into the ring post.

01:43:46.554 --> 01:43:48.847
Coming out now,
he wants at him.

01:43:48.931 --> 01:43:52.392
Balboa's tagged. Left, left, and
right combinations by the champion.

01:43:52.476 --> 01:43:55.729
Another left. He's leaning
back, but there's the bell!

01:43:55.813 --> 01:43:57.355
There's the end
of the round.

01:44:00.318 --> 01:44:03.153
There's a lot of
bad blood between these two.

01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:05.572
Good round.
Good round.

01:44:05.656 --> 01:44:06.990
I can't believe it.
What?

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.742
He broke my nose again.

01:44:08.826 --> 01:44:11.912
Balboa has gotta be in great
shape to withstand that butchery.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:15.415
Man, I'll tell you, that's just
what it is. It's plain old butchery.

01:44:15.833 --> 01:44:17.542
Did the switching bother
you? Nothing bothered me.

01:44:17.627 --> 01:44:18.752
All right, but then you
should have had him.

01:44:18.836 --> 01:44:20.420
You can't be hurt.

01:44:20.504 --> 01:44:22.881
You follow? You can't be
hurt, 'cause you are too tough.

01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:25.300
Now don't let up on this man.
This man is dangerous.

01:44:25.384 --> 01:44:26.801
This man is dangerous?
I'm dangerous.

01:44:26.886 --> 01:44:28.261
The man is dangerous.

01:44:28.346 --> 01:44:29.804
That guy is great.

01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:31.348
No. Listen,
he's only a man.

01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:34.351
You can beat him
because you're a tank.

01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:38.063
You're a greasy, fast,
200-pound Italian tank.

01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:40.273
Go through him!
Run over him!

01:44:40.358 --> 01:44:42.484
I'm a tank.
I'm gonna get him.

01:44:43.069 --> 01:44:44.986
This is it, man!
The best of all time!

01:44:45.071 --> 01:44:46.488
Here we go.
Round two.

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:50.325
Round two. The champion comes back
out. He's leaning across again.

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:52.160
Starting with a left
and a left and a left.

01:44:52.244 --> 01:44:54.955
Left to the chin, left to the head.
Left to the chin, left to the head.

01:44:55.039 --> 01:44:56.790
Coming around now.
Just holding that right hand.

01:44:56.874 --> 01:44:57.999
He's got it cocked.

01:44:58.084 --> 01:45:00.377
He's just waiting for that
precise moment that he wants to...

01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:03.296
There it is! He unloaded
that, but here comes Balboa!

01:45:06.592 --> 01:45:08.677
You can't hurt me. He
can't hurt me! No way!

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:11.054
Break it up.
Break it up.

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:13.807
Break it up.
Break clean.

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:15.225
Come on, come on.

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:19.062
You're too slow!
Man, you're too slow!

01:45:20.064 --> 01:45:24.275
Get your cameras ready. Watch this
now. Watch this. He's going down.

01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:27.612
Here it comes!

01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:36.121
Down he goes!

01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:37.414
Rocky!

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:39.416
Get up, Rock! Get up!

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:43.253
Balboa for the second time
is down, struggling to get up.

01:45:43.796 --> 01:45:47.382
Don't get up. Just stay down
there. Just stay down there, chump!

01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:48.466
I told you!

01:45:48.551 --> 01:45:49.509
Beautiful!

01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:52.679
Six,
seven, eight...

01:45:52.763 --> 01:45:55.265
Protect that eye, kid!
Get at it!

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:56.933
The body, the body, the body!
You're a tank, kid!

01:45:57.018 --> 01:45:58.476
Let's go, Rock.
Yeah.

01:45:58.561 --> 01:46:00.437
I told you! I told you!

01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:04.649
And here comes
the champion...

01:46:04.734 --> 01:46:06.026
One, two, now.
One, two.

01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:08.695
Here it is. A left and a right and
he's got him back in the corner!

01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:10.113
Balboa's back in the corner!

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:13.491
But here comes Balboa again!
Where does he get that stamina?

01:46:13.576 --> 01:46:15.702
He's got the champion
trapped in the corner.

01:46:15.786 --> 01:46:18.580
And he's breaking
left and right, left...

01:46:18.664 --> 01:46:26.713
Rocky! Rocky!

01:46:32.261 --> 01:46:33.678
Keep it up! Keep it up!

01:46:38.142 --> 01:46:39.559
I'm standing here.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:42.145
A great second round. And
they're taunting each other.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:45.648
The bell, the round is over,
but they're taunting each other.

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:49.110
Everybody in the audience better
get ready for World War III.

01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:53.698
I ain't going down
no more.

01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:56.076
Attaboy! Go get him!

01:47:09.215 --> 01:47:10.673
Come on, kid!

01:47:13.511 --> 01:47:14.844
Come on,
break it up!

01:47:17.389 --> 01:47:18.431
And the champion
again

01:47:18.516 --> 01:47:22.143
with a combination of lefts
and rights to the head.

01:47:24.105 --> 01:47:25.438
That was another
round for Creed.

01:47:25.523 --> 01:47:28.233
Creed keeps piling
up the points, but...

01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:29.567
Get him, Rock.

01:47:37.827 --> 01:47:38.868
Hit him! Just hit him!

01:47:44.041 --> 01:47:46.501
Another round
for Apollo Creed.

01:47:56.929 --> 01:47:59.097
Here comes Balboa
again into the corner.

01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:01.724
Lefts and rights to the
midsection, and those hurt.

01:48:07.231 --> 01:48:09.232
Pound
the body!

01:48:09.608 --> 01:48:11.359
He's won
another round.

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:13.236
He now begins to
taunt Balboa again.

01:48:14.613 --> 01:48:15.905
Come on!

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:45.768
I'm gonna give
that round to Balboa.

01:48:45.853 --> 01:48:49.022
You wonder what's on Apollo
Creed's mind right now.

01:48:49.106 --> 01:48:51.191
He's lost his first round.

01:48:57.239 --> 01:48:58.823
Go for it, Rock!

01:49:06.957 --> 01:49:09.375
Balboa is on his way.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.884
Hands up! Hands up!
Now, just stick and move!

01:49:17.968 --> 01:49:20.386
This man is breaking you up
inside! Now, stick and move!

01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:21.846
Keep your hands up!

01:49:22.806 --> 01:49:24.724
Lightning! Thunder!

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:44.035
Hit him back!

01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:52.669
I thought he took a beating 10 months
ago, Stu, but tonight it's twice as bad!

01:49:54.171 --> 01:49:57.382
Another round for the
champion, Apollo Creed.

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:01.761
The left eye is closed.
Now bust him, understand?

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:03.012
Keep working on him.

01:50:04.890 --> 01:50:06.099
Stay away from him.

01:50:06.183 --> 01:50:08.268
Don't let him breathe!
Get him!

01:50:24.868 --> 01:50:27.870
Balboa's taking another
beating in the corner.

01:50:29.581 --> 01:50:31.916
Another round
for the champion.

01:51:09.705 --> 01:51:11.497
Now come on!
You got him beat on points.

01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:12.915
You understand?
Now, stick and move!

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.083
Don't go for
the knockout!

01:51:14.168 --> 01:51:15.209
He's gonna fall.
He's gonna fall.

01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:18.212
Don't go for the knockout, you understand!
Now he's breaking you up inside!

01:51:18.297 --> 01:51:19.881
How's that eye now?
It works.

01:51:19.965 --> 01:51:21.883
You can't do much more
with that, can you?

01:51:21.967 --> 01:51:23.259
I know what I'm doing.

01:51:23.344 --> 01:51:25.345
Hey, Rock. You get in trouble
one more time, I'm gonna...

01:51:25.429 --> 01:51:26.763
Please don't stop nothing!

01:51:26.847 --> 01:51:28.806
Now, listen,
let me stop it.

01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:30.475
Listen, you're getting
killed out there, kid!

01:51:30.559 --> 01:51:31.684
It's my life.

01:51:31.769 --> 01:51:35.813
Apollo well ahead. All he has to do
is stay away and he retains the title.

01:51:35.939 --> 01:51:37.815
Just stick and move. It
ain't gonna be like last time.

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:38.983
It ain't gonna
be like last time.

01:51:39.068 --> 01:51:40.109
Now you got
three minutes.

01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:42.195
Switch now to southpaw anyway, will you?

01:51:42.279 --> 01:51:43.738
No tricks.
I ain't switching.

01:51:43.822 --> 01:51:44.989
Yeah, but you're
fading out.

01:51:45.074 --> 01:51:46.199
I don't need no tricks.

01:51:46.283 --> 01:51:47.325
All right,
all right.

01:51:47.409 --> 01:51:48.701
I ain't switching.

01:51:48.786 --> 01:51:50.078
You gotta plan.
You gotta switch, kid.

01:51:50.162 --> 01:51:51.996
He's ready.
Believe me.

01:51:52.081 --> 01:51:54.082
Apollo, don't go for the
knockout. You got him burned!

01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:56.250
They come to
the center of the ring

01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:58.378
for the start of
the 15th and final round.

01:51:58.462 --> 01:51:59.712
You're going down.

01:51:59.797 --> 01:52:01.089
No. No way.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.049
Here we go.

01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:04.801
Let's see what
Creed does here now.

01:52:04.885 --> 01:52:08.262
Creed has started to move in on
Balboa. He's going for the knockout.

01:52:08.347 --> 01:52:10.681
The champion comes out
jabbing with that left hand.

01:52:10.766 --> 01:52:11.849
He's taking
that left hand out.

01:52:11.934 --> 01:52:13.434
The champion is
beating Balboa...

01:52:13.519 --> 01:52:15.019
Now! Now!

01:52:19.483 --> 01:52:21.734
Balboa just nearly
floored the champ!

01:52:21.819 --> 01:52:24.821
A leaping hook caught the
exhausted champ off guard!

01:52:24.905 --> 01:52:27.573
Creed doesn't know where
he is! It's blind instinct!

01:52:27.658 --> 01:52:29.617
Balboa is staggering
from exhaustion.

01:52:29.701 --> 01:52:33.246
Balboa throws a right to
the head of the champion.

01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:36.207
Another right, and a left to the
head. He's got him into the corner.

01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:38.000
Stay away from him!

01:52:38.877 --> 01:52:43.339
He's got this thing won if he stays
away, but now it is Creed coming back.

01:52:43.424 --> 01:52:44.757
Creed with a left hand.

01:52:44.842 --> 01:52:46.175
Go for it!

01:52:47.261 --> 01:52:50.930
What's keeping these two guys
up? A tremendous boxing moment.

01:52:51.014 --> 01:52:52.098
Now!

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:57.562
Here comes Balboa, but the
champion's back with another left.

01:53:01.567 --> 01:53:03.025
Get away from him!

01:53:04.653 --> 01:53:09.198
A right hand! A right hand! It's
Creed! Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed!

01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:11.284
Now a tremendous left by...

01:53:11.368 --> 01:53:13.744
They're standing dead in the
center of the ring, toe to toe.

01:53:13.829 --> 01:53:17.415
I don't know why the champion
is fighting Balboa's fight.

01:53:22.045 --> 01:53:23.921
Go, Rocky! Go for it!

01:53:25.883 --> 01:53:31.304
A tremendous left to
the head. A left. A left.

01:53:45.444 --> 01:53:46.611
One!

01:53:51.533 --> 01:53:52.617
Two!

01:53:55.454 --> 01:53:57.538
Creed will retain
the title!

01:53:57.623 --> 01:54:02.543
If neither gets up, it's a draw, and
Creed will win the title automatically!

01:54:03.879 --> 01:54:04.837
Four!

01:54:04.922 --> 01:54:06.047
Get up, man!

01:54:06.548 --> 01:54:08.174
Get on your feet!

01:54:09.718 --> 01:54:10.801
Five!

01:54:11.887 --> 01:54:13.387
Balboa reaches
for another!

01:54:13.472 --> 01:54:14.931
Get up, Rock! Get up!

01:54:16.099 --> 01:54:17.183
Six!

01:54:17.267 --> 01:54:19.435
He's trying and
trying to beat the count!

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:20.937
Now the champ is
trying to get up!

01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:22.188
Seven!

01:54:22.272 --> 01:54:25.149
Get up, Rocky!

01:54:27.778 --> 01:54:29.111
Eight!

01:54:32.157 --> 01:54:33.282
Get up!

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.784
Nine!

01:54:34.952 --> 01:54:37.828
The champ is trying... And he's down!

01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:39.622
Ten!

01:54:39.957 --> 01:54:40.957
Out!

01:54:46.046 --> 01:54:49.173
He made it! Rocky Balboa
has shocked the world!

01:54:49.258 --> 01:54:52.552
He is the new heavyweight
champion of the world!

01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:55.805
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:54:55.889 --> 01:55:01.352
in a stunning upset,
scoring a win by knockout,

01:55:01.436 --> 01:55:05.481
the new heavyweight
champion of the world...

01:55:06.483 --> 01:55:07.775
Yo, Creed.

01:55:07.859 --> 01:55:09.068
Rocky Balboa!

01:55:11.488 --> 01:55:12.947
Good luck.

01:55:14.366 --> 01:55:16.409
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:55:17.369 --> 01:55:20.955
I can't believe this
has happened. I can't...

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:26.627
And I just want to say thanks to
Apollo, for fighting me, Apollo.

01:55:27.879 --> 01:55:30.798
I want to thank
Mickey for training me.

01:55:32.384 --> 01:55:34.010
We love you, Rock!

01:55:34.094 --> 01:55:35.970
Yeah, and I love youse, too.

01:55:38.473 --> 01:55:40.850
Most of all I want
to thank God.

01:55:43.145 --> 01:55:45.896
Except for my kid
being born,

01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:50.776
this is the greatest night
in the history of my life.

01:55:52.154 --> 01:55:57.033
I just want to say one thing
to my wife who's home.

01:55:58.994 --> 01:56:01.954
Yo, Adrian! I did it!

01:56:02.039 --> 01:56:05.166
I love you. I love you.

01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:14.550
Rocky! Rocky!
