MARONI:
<i>Fish Mooney's alive.</i>
(yelling)

00:10.675 --> 00:11.975
You've been playing me
for a chump.

00:11.977 --> 00:14.210
No! No. No. No! No!

00:14.212 --> 00:15.245
<i>You better stop</i>

00:15.247 --> 00:16.746
this machine right now,

00:16.748 --> 00:18.481
because if I die,

00:18.483 --> 00:20.517
Don Falcone is gonna
send a team up here

00:20.519 --> 00:22.185
to skin you alive

00:22.187 --> 00:23.720

the killer removed
his adrenal glands.

00:29.361 --> 00:31.394

02:09.461 --> 02:11.294
Oh, I hope so, lady.

02:28.613 --> 02:30.513
First man
that comes at a new girl

nearly always gets jumped

Here's a promise, boys.

02:50.368 --> 02:53.636
The first of you
to come at me will die like...

02:53.638 --> 02:55.505
that.

02:55.507 --> 02:57.140
The second

02:57.142 --> 02:59.208
will die slow.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.915
So, boys...

03:07.918 --> 03:11.454
...who's first?

03:20.297 --> 03:22.732
THOMPKINS:
Thank you. That was wonderful.

03:22.734 --> 03:24.734
GORDON:
Yeah. Taxi!

03:24.736 --> 03:26.736
And no case files.

03:26.738 --> 03:28.538
And we didn't mention work once.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.940
(laughs)
There's hope for us yet.

03:30.942 --> 03:32.942
Yeah.

03:32.944 --> 03:35.778
So, what is this,
our third date?

03:35.780 --> 03:38.414
I believe that's correct.

03:38.416 --> 03:41.918
Three dates, and I still haven't
been to your apartment.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.121
Well, what particular room in my
apartment are you interested in?

03:45.123 --> 03:47.557
Oh, I don't know.
How's the kitchen?
Small.

03:47.559 --> 03:49.092
Living room?
Dark.

03:49.094 --> 03:51.060
What about the bedroom?
The bedroom I think you'd like.

03:51.062 --> 03:52.996
Yeah? Taxi!

03:53.998 --> 03:55.632
But not tonight.

03:55.634 --> 03:57.567
No?

03:57.569 --> 03:59.435
I have
to get a good night's sleep.

03:59.437 --> 04:01.404
I start a new job
in the morning.

04:01.406 --> 04:04.240
A new job? Congratulations.
Since when?

04:04.242 --> 04:07.043
I heard this morning.
I didn't want to spoil dinner

04:07.045 --> 04:08.811
with a whole big
discussion about it.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.414
Why would it spoil dinner?

04:11.416 --> 04:14.083
I'm coming to work
at the GCPD.

04:14.085 --> 04:17.019
I'm you're new
medical examiner.

04:17.022 --> 04:18.353
You're kidding.

04:20.024 --> 04:21.224
Wow. That's great.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.860
Is it?

04:23.862 --> 04:27.497
Of course. I mean, I was the one
that suggested you work there.

04:27.499 --> 04:28.731
Yes, but now it's real.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.600
So? Good.

04:30.602 --> 04:32.669
We'll see, won't we?

04:38.776 --> 04:40.843
Good night.

05:00.432 --> 05:02.832
Same exact surgical
incisions as our last victim.

05:02.834 --> 05:05.735
What are the odds he's
got no adrenal glands?

Not without your father.

07:29.143 --> 07:31.611
Come here.

07:31.613 --> 07:34.147
He would have
approved, you know.

07:34.149 --> 07:38.451
Carrying on the tradition
like this.

07:38.453 --> 07:40.687
My father and I stayed
overnight.

07:40.689 --> 07:43.523
We woke up early
to watch the sunrise.

07:43.525 --> 07:45.525
It's not the same.

07:45.527 --> 07:47.594
Well, maybe next year, then.

07:52.066 --> 07:53.933
Well, off you go then.

08:00.808 --> 08:03.142
OSWALD:
<i>And then, the worst of it...</i>

08:03.144 --> 08:05.044
Maroni had me locked me
inside a sedan

08:05.046 --> 08:06.613
and tried
to crush me alive.

08:06.615 --> 08:09.682
So, well, you can
imagine my concern.

08:09.684 --> 08:12.485
Maroni's not a man
to let things go,

08:12.487 --> 08:15.388
and I fear he will
come after me in retaliation.

08:15.390 --> 08:17.924
Were you planning to
clean up the place?

08:17.926 --> 08:20.026
What?

08:20.028 --> 08:23.263
Oh, um, I... I can...
if you like.

08:23.265 --> 08:25.198
It needs it.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.267
Is that blood?

08:28.202 --> 08:30.270
Perhaps.

08:30.272 --> 08:32.405
But Don Falcone...

08:32.407 --> 08:33.840
While you're at it...

08:33.842 --> 08:37.043
maybe you could do
something about the design.

08:37.044 --> 08:38.845
The design?

08:38.847 --> 08:41.381
It reeks of Fish Mooney.

08:41.383 --> 08:43.482
What do you think
about the lamps?

08:43.485 --> 08:45.218
(anxious laugh)

08:45.220 --> 08:48.054
Don Falcone, maybe
you didn't hear me.

08:48.056 --> 08:50.556
I need your protection.

08:50.558 --> 08:52.525
Maroni will surely
try and kill me.

08:52.527 --> 08:53.860
Yes.

08:53.862 --> 08:56.262
The lamps should go.

08:56.264 --> 08:59.599
Don Falcone, please!

08:59.601 --> 09:02.602
Maroni wants my scalp,
and you'd have me redecorate.

09:04.638 --> 09:07.573
This nightclub makes
a lot of money.

09:07.575 --> 09:09.943
Without money,
we lose influence.

09:09.945 --> 09:11.945
Without influence,
we lose control.

09:11.947 --> 09:15.014
And without control,
Maroni killing you

09:15.016 --> 09:16.416
is no longer a hypothetical.

09:16.418 --> 09:17.684
It's a foregone conclusion.

09:17.686 --> 09:20.853
That's why I want
to reopen it.

09:20.855 --> 09:22.655
Under your care.

09:22.657 --> 09:24.557
I can have the club?

09:24.559 --> 09:25.591
(gasps)

09:25.593 --> 09:26.626
It's mine?

09:26.628 --> 09:28.061
You've earned it.

09:28.063 --> 09:31.097
Your days of sneaking around,
spying on Maroni, are over.

09:31.099 --> 09:33.066
You're with me now.

09:33.068 --> 09:34.834
Publicly.

09:34.836 --> 09:36.502
Things are gonna
be much different.

09:36.504 --> 09:39.305
So spruce up the place,
get it open.

09:39.307 --> 09:42.675
As for Maroni, leave him to me.

09:43.677 --> 09:45.478
What do you got?

09:45.480 --> 09:47.447
BULLOCK: Your book

09:47.449 --> 09:49.315
Tell you one thing...

09:49.317 --> 09:51.417
girls didn't look like this
when I was back in high school.

09:51.419 --> 09:52.485
Easy...

09:52.487 --> 09:54.454
I'm just sayin'.

09:55.289 --> 09:56.489
Hi, Jim.

09:56.491 --> 09:59.793

Harvey, right?

09:59.795 --> 10:01.694

10:01.696 --> 10:03.596
Lee's our new M.E.

10:03.598 --> 10:06.132
You're joking.

10:06.134 --> 10:07.867
No.

10:11.239 --> 10:13.373
Oh, right.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.808
Right. Arkham.

10:20.048 --> 10:21.347

10:21.349 --> 10:23.616
Lots to get you
up to speed on.

10:23.618 --> 10:25.618
It was good to see you again,
Detective.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.854
It was really good
to see you, Doctor.

10:32.726 --> 10:34.894
You have no luck at all,
do you, brother?

10:34.896 --> 10:37.630
What do you mean?
You find a fine
lady like that,

10:37.632 --> 10:40.266
and she comes to work
with you in the same building?

10:40.268 --> 10:41.868
It's a damn shame.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.369
Why?

10:43.371 --> 10:47.407
Office romance
always ends in tears... tears!

10:47.409 --> 10:48.908
It's not gonna be like that.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.444
Trust me. I know.

10:55.449 --> 10:57.483
There.

10:57.485 --> 10:59.085
Holy Mother Mary.

10:59.087 --> 11:02.455
You got him?
Staring right back at me.

11:02.457 --> 11:04.791
That's him. That's him.
That's the guy from the pool.

11:04.793 --> 11:06.092
His name is Gerald Crane.

11:06.094 --> 11:08.094
He's a biology teacher.

11:08.096 --> 11:10.430
School doesn't let out
for hours.

11:10.432 --> 11:12.799
Let's go.

11:15.602 --> 11:17.403
I'm Kelly.

11:17.405 --> 11:18.871
Fish.

11:18.873 --> 11:20.205
Fish?

11:20.207 --> 11:22.708
That's what I said: Fish.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.276
(man coughing in distance)

11:24.278 --> 11:26.512
So... where are we?

11:26.514 --> 11:28.347
What is this place?

11:28.349 --> 11:30.849
Some people think
it's a prison.

11:30.851 --> 11:33.152
Some think it's Hell.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.988
I just think
it's cold, mostly.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.323

11:40.660 --> 11:42.661
Breakfast.

11:42.663 --> 11:45.764
No. Uh-uh.
(grunts)

11:47.367 --> 11:50.903
You got to let
the boss eat first.

11:50.905 --> 11:53.472
People call him Mace.

11:53.474 --> 11:55.941
He's the one in charge, hmm?

11:57.510 --> 11:59.178
Okay. Okay.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.479
MAN: Get up there!
Get up there!

12:00.481 --> 12:02.715
Go on! Move!

12:02.717 --> 12:04.750
(birds chirping, water burbling)

12:35.649 --> 12:38.918
WOMAN: <i> Gerald called in one day</i>
<i>and said he wasn't coming in.</i>

12:38.920 --> 12:41.120
That's the last I heard of him.
Let me guess,
that was about three weeks ago?

12:41.122 --> 12:43.923
Yeah.
That's when neighbors said
he up and moved out.

12:43.925 --> 12:46.192
Unis searched the place.
Nothing.
Hmm.

12:46.194 --> 12:48.261
So what can you tell us
about Crane?

12:48.263 --> 12:49.862
He was a
good teacher.

12:49.864 --> 12:51.797
Focused. And a good father.

12:51.799 --> 12:55.501
He was very protective
of his son Jonathan.

12:55.503 --> 12:58.504
But he could be quiet, too.
Somber.

12:58.506 --> 13:00.907
Think it had to do
with his wife... she died six

13:00.909 --> 13:02.074
or seven years ago.

13:02.076 --> 13:04.110
She died? How?
Uh,

13:04.112 --> 13:05.578
car accident.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.581
Did Crane ever talk
about fear or phobias?

13:08.583 --> 13:09.882
Why?

13:09.884 --> 13:12.652
Is someone targeting phobics?

13:13.887 --> 13:14.887
Yeah.

13:15.522 --> 13:17.089
Killing them?

13:17.091 --> 13:19.358
Does this mean something to you?

13:19.360 --> 13:20.626
These victims,

13:20.628 --> 13:22.295
were they missing
their adrenal glands?

13:22.297 --> 13:23.729
How'd you know that?

13:23.731 --> 13:25.665
Uh...

13:27.801 --> 13:30.603
This was an academic paper

13:30.605 --> 13:31.804
that Gerald wrote
a few months ago.

13:31.806 --> 13:33.139
He asked me to proof it for him.

13:33.141 --> 13:34.640
See, Gerald had a theory

13:34.642 --> 13:38.144
that fear was an
evolutionary flaw in humans.

13:38.146 --> 13:40.646
War, rape,
theft, murder...

13:40.648 --> 13:42.448
it was all caused by fear.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.317
He was obsessed
with it.
GORDON: So Crane

13:44.319 --> 13:47.119
killed these people and took
their glands to test a theory?

13:47.121 --> 13:50.890
No... Gerald wasn't trying to
prove he was right about fear.

13:50.892 --> 13:53.426
He was trying
to cure himself of it.

13:53.428 --> 13:54.760
NYGMA:
<i>Crane's idea</i>

13:54.762 --> 13:56.963
of curing fear was to
inoculate himself against it.

13:56.965 --> 13:59.131
Like a disease?
Exactly. But in
order to do so,

13:59.133 --> 14:01.901
he needed a condensed source
of the hormones that cause fear.

14:01.903 --> 14:03.502
Phobics.

14:03.504 --> 14:05.438
Crane's preying
on them?

14:05.440 --> 14:07.740
Spiking their fear
by scaring them

14:07.742 --> 14:10.209
and then killing them in order
to harvest the hormones?

14:10.211 --> 14:11.544
BULLOCK:
Damn!

14:11.546 --> 14:13.079
How much of this stuff
does he need?

14:13.081 --> 14:14.280
What do you mean?

14:14.282 --> 14:16.349
How many more people
is he gonna kill?

14:16.351 --> 14:18.317
Oh. Of course.
Good question.

14:18.319 --> 14:20.319
Depends on how scared
he is, I guess.

14:20.321 --> 14:21.587
What's he scared of?

14:21.589 --> 14:23.256
In Scottie's phobia
support group,

14:23.258 --> 14:25.057
he said he was afraid
of failure.

14:25.059 --> 14:26.325
(Bullock sniffing)

14:26.327 --> 14:29.061
GORDON: Who isn't?
It's gotta be something else.

14:29.063 --> 14:31.564
Did you hear?
Hear what?

14:31.566 --> 14:33.065
That we got
a new medical examiner.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.001
Much better
than the old one.

14:35.003 --> 14:36.869
And she smells nice.

14:36.871 --> 14:38.004
(chuckles)

14:38.006 --> 14:40.006
See, Jim?
Competition already.

14:40.008 --> 14:42.008
Look at this.

14:42.010 --> 14:45.344
Crane developed protocols
for two inoculations,

14:45.346 --> 14:48.080
himself and somebody else...
Subject B.

14:48.082 --> 14:49.181
Ooh!

14:49.183 --> 14:51.117

15:41.968 --> 15:44.369
It's working, Jonathan.

15:44.371 --> 15:47.973

You'll be cured.

15:58.585 --> 16:00.252
Are you ready, Jonathan?

16:00.254 --> 16:02.321
Are you ready, son?

16:10.794 --> 16:12.595
Thank you for having me.
My pleasure.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.263
We're friends, right?

16:14.265 --> 16:17.733
Of course.
Then let me talk

16:17.735 --> 16:20.469
You want to have lunch,

16:26.043 --> 16:28.344

27:33.639 --> 27:36.640
(sobbing)
Judge Turnbull.

27:36.642 --> 27:38.575
FALCONE:
<i>He was out with a young man.</i>

27:38.577 --> 27:40.244
<i>I had him drugged
and brought here.</i>

27:40.246 --> 27:42.479
Ooh.
Now he's all yours.

27:42.481 --> 27:45.148
Mine?
(muffled sobbing)

27:45.150 --> 27:47.017
I mean, we'll share him...
(thump)

27:47.019 --> 27:50.087
of course, but, uh,
in spirit,

27:50.089 --> 27:51.188
he's yours.

27:51.190 --> 27:52.923
Now smile for the camera.

27:52.925 --> 27:54.925
(Turnbull whimpering)

27:54.927 --> 27:56.994
It's beautiful.

27:58.029 --> 28:00.030
GORDON: We must be
missing something.

28:00.032 --> 28:02.533
BULLOCK: What about
your pal Penguin?

28:02.535 --> 28:04.535
What about him?

28:04.537 --> 28:05.903
He helped us with Flass.

28:05.905 --> 28:08.238
Maybe he'll help us with Crane.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.540
No. I'm not going back to him.

28:09.542 --> 28:11.842
It's worth a try.
No, it's not.

28:11.844 --> 28:13.310
Then we wait for another
body to drop,

28:13.312 --> 28:15.379
because we're not
gonna find him here.

28:18.049 --> 28:19.550
Yeah, you're right.

28:19.552 --> 28:22.686
We're never gonna
be able to track Crane.

28:22.688 --> 28:23.754
We gotta get ahead of him

28:23.756 --> 28:24.855
by finding out
what's driving him.

28:24.857 --> 28:26.523
We know what's driving him.

28:26.525 --> 28:28.258
He's obsessed with fear.
Yeah.

28:28.260 --> 28:29.260
But why?

28:29.261 --> 28:31.128
What's he afraid of?

28:31.130 --> 28:32.329
What happened to him that

28:32.331 --> 28:33.897
made him this way?

28:33.899 --> 28:36.467
His wife was killed
in a car crash.

28:38.002 --> 28:39.470
Yeah.

28:39.472 --> 28:40.604
Check that out.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.311
BULLOCK:
Got it. Karen Crane.

28:47.313 --> 28:49.079
GORDON: Yeah.

28:49.081 --> 28:51.582
Says here she died
in a house fire,
not a car accident.

28:51.584 --> 28:54.485
You think
the coworker was lying?

28:54.487 --> 28:56.954
Three other people
said the same thing.

28:56.956 --> 28:58.956
Crane must've lied
about it for some reason.

28:58.958 --> 29:00.290
What happened in the fire?

29:00.292 --> 29:01.625
Article says she was
sleeping upstairs

29:01.627 --> 29:02.926
when the fire broke out.

29:02.928 --> 29:05.529
Husband Gerald
and son Jonathan, eight,

29:05.531 --> 29:07.598
were downstairs.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.101
Crane was in the house
when his wife died?

29:11.103 --> 29:13.170
And didn't save her.
No wonder he lied.

29:13.172 --> 29:14.905
He's ashamed.

29:14.907 --> 29:17.307
His fear is the reason
his wife died.

29:17.309 --> 29:18.675
That's why
he's doing this.

29:18.677 --> 29:20.644
Address for the old Crane house.
Let's go.

29:20.646 --> 29:23.180
Okay.

29:27.885 --> 29:31.588
<i>(heartbeat slowing)</i>

29:42.567 --> 29:45.235
Jonathan!

29:50.274 --> 29:52.008
(door slams in distance)

29:52.010 --> 29:54.444
Jonathan!

29:55.513 --> 29:57.481
Stop, Johnny, stop!

29:57.483 --> 29:58.615
Stop there!

29:58.617 --> 30:02.085
We've started
the protocol.

30:02.087 --> 30:04.388
It must be completed, it will
be harmful for you otherwise.

30:04.390 --> 30:06.623
I can't... I can't do it again.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.759
Think of it Johnny...
no more fear.

30:08.761 --> 30:11.094
I'm not-I'm not even
afraid like you.

30:11.096 --> 30:12.462
We're all afraid.

30:12.464 --> 30:14.297
Every man and woman
on the planet.

30:14.299 --> 30:16.199
We're all standing
at the edge of the abyss,

30:16.201 --> 30:17.334
paralyzed by fear.

30:19.437 --> 30:20.704
Now, come on, son.

30:20.706 --> 30:22.139
Trust me.

30:22.141 --> 30:23.807
I just want to help you.

30:23.809 --> 30:25.609
And mankind.

30:25.611 --> 30:27.411
Mankind, Johnny.

30:27.413 --> 30:30.547
Now you must
be brave, hmm?

30:30.549 --> 30:31.882
Come on, son.

30:31.884 --> 30:33.750
Are you with me?

30:33.752 --> 30:35.585
Then let's go back
to the house.

30:35.587 --> 30:38.822
It'll all be over before
you know it, I promise.

30:41.325 --> 30:43.393
Come on.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.011
(watch ticking)

31:12.353 --> 31:14.421
(grunting)

31:35.810 --> 31:37.878
(gasping in pain)

31:52.126 --> 31:54.194
(grunts)

31:58.032 --> 31:59.533
Ah, come on.

31:59.535 --> 32:01.101
(grunting):
Come on.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.742
What's up, Doc?

32:17.318 --> 32:19.852
The name's Mace.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.354
That's cute, but I like

32:21.356 --> 32:23.823
to give my friends
nicknames.

32:23.825 --> 32:26.292
And yours is Doc...

32:26.294 --> 32:28.461
'cause you have
such a wise look in your eyes

32:28.463 --> 32:30.530
for such a big man.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.999
A real little firecracker, huh?

32:33.001 --> 32:34.467
Mm.

32:34.469 --> 32:35.935
A firecracker goes off once

32:35.937 --> 32:38.605
and then just lies there.

32:38.607 --> 32:41.975
What you're looking at
is the Fourth of July.

32:41.977 --> 32:44.310
Come sit by me.

32:44.312 --> 32:46.179
Does that mean we have a deal?
Sure, baby.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.982
Well, I have a couple of riders
I would like to talk to you...

32:48.984 --> 32:50.984
Hush, now, baby.
(weak laugh)

32:50.986 --> 32:54.020
You talk too much and
you'll make me mad.

32:54.022 --> 32:56.055
Huh, let's see...

32:56.057 --> 32:58.324
That's rider number one.

32:58.326 --> 33:00.627
Don't call me "baby."

33:00.629 --> 33:02.028
(grunting)

33:03.731 --> 33:04.797
Ah!

33:07.301 --> 33:10.670
My name is Fish Mooney.

33:10.672 --> 33:13.239
I'm in charge now.

33:33.694 --> 33:34.861
(knocking on door)

33:34.863 --> 33:36.396
GORDON:
GCPD!

33:36.398 --> 33:37.597
No, no, no!
Dad.

33:37.599 --> 33:38.965
Come on, we have to go <i> now.</i>

33:38.967 --> 33:40.200
(knocking on door)

33:40.202 --> 33:42.135
GCPD!

33:42.137 --> 33:43.770
Dad, they are going
to arrest you

33:43.772 --> 33:45.438
once they come in here.
We have to go now!

33:45.440 --> 33:47.841
There's still time.
We can complete the protocol.

33:47.843 --> 33:49.509
Coming in.

33:49.511 --> 33:50.844
(clattering)

33:58.653 --> 33:59.653
(grunts)

33:59.655 --> 34:01.388
(panting):
What are you doing?

34:01.390 --> 34:03.089
We have to finish the protocol.

34:03.091 --> 34:05.492
It's the only way.
Dad, that's too much.

34:05.494 --> 34:07.794
(whispers):
It's the only way.

34:10.031 --> 34:12.299
Look, Dad...

34:12.301 --> 34:14.234
there's not enough time.

34:14.235 --> 34:16.469
It'll be fine.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.540
I love you, son.
Stop!

34:21.574 --> 34:24.210
(grunts, gasps)

34:24.212 --> 34:27.781
<i>(heart beating rapidly)</i>

34:29.216 --> 34:32.284
(Jonathan gasping)

34:33.853 --> 34:35.355
(growling)

34:35.357 --> 34:37.456
(screaming, sobbing)

34:43.864 --> 34:45.998
(Jonathan screaming in distance)

34:46.001 --> 34:48.201
(screaming stops)

34:48.203 --> 34:50.904
Hands where we
can see 'em!

34:50.906 --> 34:53.139
GORDON:
Hands in the air

34:53.141 --> 34:54.141
or we'll shoot!

34:54.141 --> 34:56.076
You think I'm afraid of you?

34:56.078 --> 34:58.845
Not another step!
Afraid of your guns?

35:01.749 --> 35:03.216
(groans)

35:03.218 --> 35:05.185
I have no fear!

35:09.023 --> 35:11.224
(Gerald yells, grunts)

35:15.930 --> 35:18.331
You take him.
I'll get the kid.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.769
GORDON:
Call an ambulance.

35:22.771 --> 35:24.104
(gasping, moaning)

35:24.106 --> 35:26.473
Call an ambulance!

35:26.475 --> 35:27.807
It's all right, son!

35:27.809 --> 35:29.175
It's all right!

35:39.748 --> 35:42.817
(panting, grunting)

35:44.653 --> 35:45.720
(owl hoots in distance)

35:46.755 --> 35:49.056
(grunting)

35:49.058 --> 35:51.125
(panting)

35:53.361 --> 35:54.995
(panting)

35:54.997 --> 35:56.797
(stops panting)

35:57.766 --> 35:59.400
Hello, there, Master Bruce.

35:59.402 --> 36:00.634
Well, you certainly
took your time.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.903
What, did you stop off
for a pie and a pint

36:02.905 --> 36:04.171
on the way out, did you?

36:04.173 --> 36:06.741
How long have you been there?

36:06.743 --> 36:09.243
Well, I don't know,
about... about an hour.

36:09.245 --> 36:12.379
Just when you started climbing
up that very nasty hill.

36:12.381 --> 36:15.282
Thanks for your help.

36:15.284 --> 36:17.451
Yeah, I never got you
down there, you know.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.387
(owl hoots in distance)

36:24.392 --> 36:26.460
You all right?

36:29.231 --> 36:30.631
Come here.

36:31.867 --> 36:33.501
I'm cold,

36:33.503 --> 36:35.636
I'm tired, and my
ankle's sprained.

36:35.638 --> 36:37.404
ALFRED:
Oh.

36:37.406 --> 36:38.839
Aah!

36:38.841 --> 36:40.641
I just want to go home.

36:40.643 --> 36:42.309
You want to go home?

36:42.311 --> 36:46.046
Or do you want to wait
and watch the sunrise?

36:46.048 --> 36:48.883
Like you did with your dad.

36:51.987 --> 36:54.121
Well, Alfred...

36:55.357 --> 36:57.124
...we can only stay
if you think you can handle it.

36:57.126 --> 36:59.994
If I can handle it?

36:59.996 --> 37:02.863
Mate, this place
is positively cushy

37:02.865 --> 37:06.400
compared to some
of the places I've slept at.

37:06.402 --> 37:07.935
Cup of tea,

Don Maroni.

37:49.545 --> 37:52.579
It's such a pleasure to see you.

37:52.581 --> 37:53.914
Look at you.

37:53.916 --> 37:56.550
From the trunk of my car
to running your own club.

37:56.552 --> 37:59.219
The place looks
good, Penguin.

37:59.221 --> 38:01.388
Hell of a turnout.

38:01.390 --> 38:02.890
(henchman chuckles)

38:02.892 --> 38:04.758
HENCHMAN:
Yeah.
How 'bout a table?

38:04.760 --> 38:05.893
Drinks?

38:05.895 --> 38:08.128
My compliments, of course.

38:10.632 --> 38:12.099
Expensive stuff.

38:12.101 --> 38:13.800
Let me see.

38:17.472 --> 38:20.807
I had a little chat
with Falcone.

38:20.809 --> 38:24.011
I came here to let you know
that all is kosher between us.

38:24.013 --> 38:28.782
Long as you don't go giving
Falcone any more of my secrets.

38:28.784 --> 38:29.983
Huh?

38:29.985 --> 38:31.318
No.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.153
Nothing like that.

38:33.155 --> 38:34.421
Of course not.

38:34.423 --> 38:35.856
Grab a glass.

38:38.193 --> 38:42.996
You better hope that old man,
Falcone, lives a long life.

38:42.998 --> 38:46.733
'Cause the second
he's out the picture,

38:46.735 --> 38:48.235
so are you.

38:58.713 --> 39:00.781
(birds chirping)

39:07.422 --> 39:09.489
Master B.

39:19.934 --> 39:21.335
ALFRED:
Sunrise.

39:35.683 --> 39:37.017
(knocking)
Oh, hey.

39:37.019 --> 39:38.151
How are you?

39:38.153 --> 39:40.053
I heard your suspect was killed.

39:40.055 --> 39:41.855
Came after Harvey and me
with a gun.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.191
Didn't have a choice.
I'm so sorry.

39:44.193 --> 39:46.627
What about his son?
(sighs)

39:46.629 --> 39:49.463
Paramedics were able
to stabilize him.

39:49.465 --> 39:51.932
I'm heading over to the hospital
now, to check in on him.

39:51.934 --> 39:53.533
Well, let me know how he is.

39:53.535 --> 39:55.602
I will.

39:57.071 --> 39:58.839
So, settled in here, huh?

39:58.841 --> 40:01.174
Uh, almost.

40:01.176 --> 40:02.309
Think you're gonna like it here?

40:02.311 --> 40:04.978
I do. So far.

40:06.547 --> 40:08.482
Good.

40:08.484 --> 40:11.018
Um, I have tickets
to the circus.

40:11.020 --> 40:12.486
Do you want to
come with me?

40:12.488 --> 40:15.322
The circus?
Yeah.
They're good.

40:15.324 --> 40:17.357
No, uh, sad elephants.
(chuckles)

40:19.160 --> 40:22.095
The circus. Sure. Why not?

40:22.097 --> 40:24.464
Look, Lee...

40:24.466 --> 40:27.334
Um...

40:27.336 --> 40:30.704
no kissing, here, on the job.

40:30.706 --> 40:32.539
Okay?
I'm serious.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.207
Okay.

40:34.209 --> 40:35.609
Okay?

40:35.611 --> 40:38.879
If your hard-ass reputation
is worth that much to you.

40:38.881 --> 40:41.481
This is a place of work.
Cops have feelings, too.

40:41.483 --> 40:43.550
It's not unprofessional
to show your feelings.

40:43.552 --> 40:46.486
Yeah, it is.
Those kinds of feelings, yeah.

40:46.488 --> 40:49.056
Fine. Be that way.

40:49.058 --> 40:51.058
Hey...

40:52.093 --> 40:53.860
I'm just joking.

40:53.862 --> 40:54.995
I'll be discreet.

41:01.603 --> 41:05.440
All right,
everyone gather round!

41:08.977 --> 41:12.447
Up until now,
there's been no order in here.

41:14.616 --> 41:17.218
No... structure.

41:24.159 --> 41:27.228
Things are gonna change.

41:28.597 --> 41:30.932
(gate opens,
weapons clicking)

41:30.934 --> 41:33.935
(woman crying)

41:33.937 --> 41:36.404
(grunting)

41:36.406 --> 41:38.005
(gate creaks shut)

41:38.007 --> 41:39.540
(crying)

41:39.542 --> 41:41.476
She's back.

41:41.478 --> 41:43.544
(woman sobbing)

41:46.081 --> 41:48.149
(sobbing):
My eyes.

41:49.251 --> 41:52.920
They took my eyes.

42:00.928 --> 42:02.362
DOCTOR:
<i>The boy received a massive dose</i>

42:02.364 --> 42:04.531
of condensed hormones...

42:04.533 --> 42:06.366
cortisol, adrenaline...

42:06.368 --> 42:10.570
and another compound we're
still trying to identify.

42:10.572 --> 42:13.540
The combination
nearly killed him.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.809
But he's gonna live?

42:15.811 --> 42:17.410
Yes.

42:17.412 --> 42:18.878
But we ran a CAT scan

42:18.880 --> 42:21.581
in order to determine
if he suffered any brain damage.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.849
The results...

42:22.851 --> 42:24.618
we've never seen anything
like them before.

42:24.620 --> 42:27.287
The hormones themselves
have long since worn off,

42:27.289 --> 42:28.555
but the effects,

42:28.557 --> 42:31.291
they seem to be lingering.

42:31.293 --> 42:32.692
What are you saying?

42:32.694 --> 42:34.227
That he's still in fear?

42:34.229 --> 42:36.129
Well, not just fear.

42:36.131 --> 42:37.263
Jonathan's brain activity shows

42:37.265 --> 42:40.467
he's in a constant state
of intense terror.

42:40.469 --> 42:41.701
How long until this goes away?

42:41.703 --> 42:42.769
Well...

42:42.771 --> 42:45.438
that's just the thing,
Detective.

42:45.440 --> 42:48.775
We can't be certain
it ever will.

42:48.777 --> 42:52.612
Imagine the thing
you fear most in the world.

42:53.581 --> 42:56.750
Imagine that
it's all you see.

42:56.752 --> 42:59.019
Every waking hour.

43:13.334 --> 43:15.402
(gasping)

43:16.437 --> 43:18.772
<i>(heart beating rapidly)</i>

43:18.774 --> 43:20.674
No, no, no!

43:20.676 --> 43:23.276
(panting)

43:25.579 --> 43:27.647
(distorted growling)

43:29.050 --> 43:31.751
(panting)

43:31.753 --> 43:35.188
(Jonathan screaming)

43:35.890 --> 43:38.990
