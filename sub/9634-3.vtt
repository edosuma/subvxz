01:51.500 --> 01:54.459
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues as Goku and Bulma

01:54.542 --> 01:55.959
have decided
to put the hunt for

01:56.042 --> 01:58.250
the remaining
Dragon Balls on hold,

01:58.334 --> 02:00.125
so that they can
help a lost turtle

02:00.209 --> 02:03.000
find its way back to the sea.

02:03.084 --> 02:07.000
I hope we get there soon,
I'm really getting hungry!

02:07.084 --> 02:10.334
You know, this is
probably the nicest thing

02:10.417 --> 02:12.334
anyone has ever done for me.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.959
Aw, hey.
It's no big deal really!

02:15.042 --> 02:17.417
Well, I just
wanted to thank you.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.292
Gosh. I think
I'm going to cry.

02:19.375 --> 02:20.542
Spare me, please.

02:20.625 --> 02:21.875
Just concentrate
on where you're going

02:21.959 --> 02:24.209
so we can get there
while we're still young.

02:24.292 --> 02:26.209
Why are you
always complaining?

02:26.292 --> 02:28.542
Why don't you try thinking
happy thoughts, Bulma?!

02:28.625 --> 02:29.917
[BULMA] Hold on.
Let's see if there's

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
anything to be happy about.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.459
Hey. Not too bad.

02:33.542 --> 02:35.417
Just two more miles. Hm!

02:35.500 --> 02:37.917
Wow! We're close.
That's great.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Huh?

02:39.084 --> 02:41.625
I can't wait to
get back in the water.

02:43.542 --> 02:44.875
[BEAR] Hm.

02:44.959 --> 02:47.292
[chuckles]

02:48.250 --> 02:51.000
Looks like dinner's on the way.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.084
[BEAR] Hold it right there!

03:01.167 --> 03:02.459
[BULMA screams]

03:02.542 --> 03:03.750
[laughs]

03:03.834 --> 03:06.209
Oh, yeah. Humans
give me heartburn

03:06.292 --> 03:08.959
but I love turtles. So look.

03:09.042 --> 03:10.792
[BEAR] Hand it
over or you're dead.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.625
Goku! You heard him!

03:12.709 --> 03:14.250
Give him the turtle, quick.

03:14.334 --> 03:15.250
Pppft!

03:15.334 --> 03:16.334
[BULMA] Eh?!

03:16.417 --> 03:18.042
Huh?! Ha!

03:18.125 --> 03:21.542
I guess a little heartburn
never hurt anybody.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.750
All right. Have it
your way. Die if you want.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.750
You idiot! You're going
to get us killed!

03:26.834 --> 03:27.792
Give it to him.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.167
I don't care
what this guy says. No.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.417
Are you out of your
freakin' mind, kid?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.125
[GOKU] He's my friend, Bulma.

03:35.209 --> 03:37.375
[chuckles] Not for long.

03:37.459 --> 03:39.334
[yells]

03:39.417 --> 03:41.125
[screams]

03:41.209 --> 03:42.667
[GOKU] I think
you better hop down.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.417
--[TURTLE wails]
--[GOKU] Huh?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.167
[grunts]

03:49.167 --> 03:50.959
[GOKU]
It's just you and me now!

03:51.042 --> 03:54.084
Ha-ha!
You think you're real cute.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.459
[BEAR] Don't you, monkey boy?!

03:57.209 --> 03:59.292
You should have
saved your skin,

03:59.375 --> 04:01.667
[BEAR]
while you had the chance.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.834
[yells]

04:04.167 --> 04:06.584
--[BEAR grunts]
--[GOKU laughs]

04:07.792 --> 04:09.459
[GOKU] You missed me.

04:12.584 --> 04:13.917
[GOKU] Over here, bear breath!

04:14.000 --> 04:15.250
[BEAR] Huh?!

04:15.334 --> 04:17.250
Forget about him, Turtle.
Let's get out of here.

04:17.334 --> 04:18.750
[laughs]

04:18.834 --> 04:22.500
I like you, kid.
Too bad you have to die.

04:22.584 --> 04:24.750
[growls]

04:25.917 --> 04:27.375
[GOKU] Yoo hoo!

04:27.459 --> 04:30.042
[laughs]

04:30.125 --> 04:32.667
[BEAR] Huh?!

04:32.750 --> 04:35.500
[GOKU] One. Two. Three.

04:35.584 --> 04:36.709
[BEAR] Huh?

04:36.792 --> 04:43.750
[groans]

04:43.834 --> 04:45.250
[GOKU] Yay!

04:46.417 --> 04:48.375
[GOKU] Well. That's that!

04:48.459 --> 04:51.417
[BULMA] Yeah... sure.
Whatever you say, kid.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.625
[GOKU] Are you okay?

04:53.709 --> 04:55.959
Yes, I'm fine, thanks to you.

04:56.042 --> 04:58.292
So some creatures think
you're good to eat, huh?

04:58.375 --> 05:01.250
What?! Oh, my!
No, no! How disgusting.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.334
Turtle meat is
tough and poisonous.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.834
You'd puke.
[laughs nervously]

05:05.917 --> 05:07.125
[GOKU] That's what I thought!

05:07.209 --> 05:08.542
Some people will eat anything.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.542
Not me, though.

05:09.625 --> 05:10.667
[sighs]

05:10.750 --> 05:12.209
[BULMA]
Ready, guys?! Let's go.

05:12.292 --> 05:13.959
[GOKU] Onward to the sea.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.334
[BULMA] Hey, wait up.

05:15.417 --> 05:18.334
[cooing]

05:19.709 --> 05:22.625
[BULMA] There it is, Goku.
I found it.

05:24.125 --> 05:28.042
Huh?! No way. Wow.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.542
[GOKU] Look! Look!
We're really here!

05:30.625 --> 05:34.334
It's huge.
And blue! And beautiful!

05:34.417 --> 05:37.250
[laughing] Whoa.

05:37.959 --> 05:40.625
The sea!

05:40.709 --> 05:42.459
[BULMA]
Isn't it beautiful, Goku?!

05:42.542 --> 05:43.959
[GOKU] Yeah! It's incredible.

05:44.042 --> 05:47.042
I never dreamed that a place
like this really existed!

05:47.125 --> 05:48.959
[TURTLE] I was starting
to wonder myself.

05:49.042 --> 05:52.542
It's been so long.
Thanks for bringing me back.

05:52.625 --> 05:56.750
[GOKU] Hey! Sure! No problem.
It was a lot of fun.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.167
[TURTLE]
Well, I'd better get going.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.125
You sure do have
a great home, Turtle!

06:02.209 --> 06:04.584
Well, I never would have
made if it wasn't for you!

06:04.667 --> 06:05.625
Thank you.

06:05.709 --> 06:07.542
[GOKU] Hey, anytime.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.750
[TURTLE]
Would you mind waiting here?

06:09.834 --> 06:11.875
I have a gift I'd like
to bring you to repay you

06:11.959 --> 06:13.834
for all you've done for me.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.084
A gift?!

06:15.167 --> 06:17.084
What kind of gift
could a Turtle have, huh?

06:17.167 --> 06:20.459
You'll see.
I'll be back soon! Mm, hm.

06:21.167 --> 06:24.875
It's not a stupid shell,
is it?! Hey, hold on.

06:27.459 --> 06:30.084
Ah... He's gone.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.875
Hey. Watcha doing there, kid?!

06:41.959 --> 06:43.917
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.834
Ew! Yucky.
This water's salty.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.625
[PILAF] Whoa!

06:52.709 --> 06:54.584
[PEOPLE] Hail, Pilaf.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.459
Hail, the Emperor.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.667
Hail, Pilaf.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.834
[ATTENDANT]
Make way for Emperor Pilaf,

07:03.917 --> 07:07.167
the supreme ruler of the world!

07:07.250 --> 07:08.000
[PILAF chuckles]

07:08.084 --> 07:09.500
Thank you! Thank you!

07:09.584 --> 07:11.292
--[SHU] Emperor Pilaf!
--[PILAF] Huh?

07:11.375 --> 07:13.209
[SHU] Emperor Pilaf!

07:13.292 --> 07:15.125
What?! Spit it out.

07:15.209 --> 07:16.334
Did you get the Dragon Ball?!

07:16.417 --> 07:17.542
[SHU] Not exactly.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.292
It's like this.
There was a slight problem

07:19.375 --> 07:20.959
with the information, Sire.

07:21.042 --> 07:22.084
And?!

07:22.167 --> 07:23.750
It was bogus. Yeah.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.875
We were nearly killed
by a huge pack of wolves.

07:25.959 --> 07:27.250
And then we crashed, Sire.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.292
Some crazy kid...
he kicked our plane.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.667
--[PILAF] Silence.
--[SHU] It was horrible.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.750
[SHU and MAI] Aah!

07:31.834 --> 07:33.542
I'm sick of your
lame-brained excuses!

07:33.625 --> 07:35.375
Now get out of here
and get that Dragon Ball,

07:35.459 --> 07:37.917
if it's the last thing
you do! Understand?!

07:38.000 --> 07:38.917
[SHU and MAI] Sir!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.542
[phone ringing]

07:41.625 --> 07:42.417
[ALL] Huh?!

07:42.500 --> 07:44.125
[PILAF] The hotline.

07:44.209 --> 07:45.834
Hello?!

07:45.917 --> 07:47.792
What's that you say?!

07:47.875 --> 07:50.167
[PILAF] You're kidding?!
And where is it?!

07:50.250 --> 07:52.334
I see. Well done.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.292
Another Dragon Ball.
We're in luck.

07:54.375 --> 07:55.875
An old hermit
named Roshi has it.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.667
No one's even guarding it!

07:57.750 --> 07:59.417
But... does he
have any wolves?!

07:59.500 --> 08:00.750
[PILAF] No, you dunder-head.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.375
He lives on an island
in the middle of the sea.

08:02.459 --> 08:03.709
Wolves don't go there.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.334
We'd better be careful.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.209
Could be another bum-steer!

08:07.292 --> 08:09.792
Never mind that!
Go get me that Dragon Ball!

08:09.875 --> 08:11.334
[SHU and MAI] Yes, sir.

08:13.542 --> 08:14.834
--[SHU] Huh?
--[MAI] Sire!

08:14.917 --> 08:17.000
[MAI] You've never come
with us on a mission before.

08:17.084 --> 08:18.209
You keep screwing up.

08:18.292 --> 08:20.667
I can't trust you two
on your own anymore.

08:24.542 --> 08:27.250
[aircraft noise]

08:27.334 --> 08:29.000
[SHU] Engaging thrusters.

08:31.084 --> 08:33.333
[SHU] Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

08:33.417 --> 08:37.875
Please fasten your seatbelts
and remain seated at all times.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.417
Forget the seatbelts.
It's too narrow in here.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.833
Yeah, it's a
little stuffy.

08:41.917 --> 08:43.667
That's cause there's
one too many in here.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.000
What did you say?!

08:45.084 --> 08:47.000
I said "I read you
loud and clear."

08:51.959 --> 08:54.625
[BULMA] Ahh! I get so relaxed
when I'm on the beach.

08:54.709 --> 08:57.209
[GOKU] Yeah! You're not
talking nearly as much.

08:57.292 --> 08:59.959
[BULMA] Huh?
Hey, what's that?!

09:00.042 --> 09:02.125
Whatever it is,
it's moving toward us.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.125
[GOKU] It's the turtle!

09:03.209 --> 09:05.250
And he's got
someone on his back.

09:06.042 --> 09:07.667
[BULMA] Wow. It's like
you've got super-vision

09:07.750 --> 09:10.542
or something!
Pretty cool, Goku.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.750
[GOKU]
Hey, Turtle. Over here.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.042
[OLD MAN] Doesn't he
realize that they're

09:14.125 --> 09:16.125
the only one's on the beach?

09:16.209 --> 09:18.084
[TURTLE] Ahoy, there. Heh, heh.

09:18.167 --> 09:20.625
Sorry I kept you waiting.

09:20.709 --> 09:23.084
[TURTLE]
I had to go get my Master.

09:23.167 --> 09:25.250
[BULMA]
Man! Check that guy out.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.917
[sighs]

09:30.000 --> 09:31.542
Well, hello there, kids.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.167
[BULMA] Hi. How's it going?!
Welcome ashore.

09:35.084 --> 09:36.500
What a cool outfit.

09:36.584 --> 09:39.000
[OLD MAN] Kids, I want to thank
you for helping my turtle!

09:39.084 --> 09:41.959
It was our pleasure, Mister.

09:42.042 --> 09:43.959
I'm Roshi!
The turtle hermit.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.834
Uh... A turtle hermit?

09:45.917 --> 09:48.292
Which one of
these kids helped you?

09:48.375 --> 09:50.500
It's that little boy, there.

09:51.209 --> 09:52.917
You're a very brave boy.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.417
I have a gift
I want to give you

09:54.500 --> 09:56.250
as a token of my gratitude.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.750
Hear that, Goku?

10:05.250 --> 10:07.459
Come, Magic Carpet.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.167
[gasps] Magic carpet?!

10:09.250 --> 10:11.250
[GOKU] What in the world
is a magic carpet?

10:11.334 --> 10:12.959
[BULMA] What's a magic carpet?

10:13.042 --> 10:16.375
It's a carpet you can sit on
and fly anywhere you want.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.917
[BULMA]
They're not real, though.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.709
At least,
I don't think they are.

10:22.792 --> 10:25.250
[TURTLE] Hey!
Uhh, Master. Hold on.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.042
You took the Magic
Carpet to the cleaners.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.625
Hey, that's right. You've got
a good point there, Turtle.

10:30.709 --> 10:31.542
Hmm.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.709
I knew it.
They're not real.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.625
The other option
is the Flying Nimbus,

10:35.709 --> 10:38.667
but am I really
ready to part with it?!

10:38.750 --> 10:41.625
Why not?! If you can
ride it, it's yours.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.875
Come to me, Flying Nimbus!

10:45.959 --> 10:47.625
He's odd.

10:47.709 --> 10:50.000
He's not odd. He's nuts.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.250
[ROSHI] Now where
is that cloud?!

10:56.584 --> 10:59.917
[ROSHI] Oh, there it is.
It's about time. See!

11:01.250 --> 11:02.959
[ROSHI]
She's a beauty, isn't she?!

11:03.042 --> 11:04.084
--[BULMA] Hm?!
--[GOKU] Whoa!

11:04.167 --> 11:05.834
[GOKU] Look, Bulma!
Isn't it neat-o?!

11:05.917 --> 11:07.959
[BULMA]
Yeah! How strange!

11:08.042 --> 11:09.042
Wow.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.125
Don't be afraid!
She's as sweet as candy.

11:11.209 --> 11:13.000
--[BULMA] Hm.
--[GOKU] Gosh.

11:13.084 --> 11:16.334
[GOKU]
It's so light and puffy.

11:16.417 --> 11:18.167
Do you mind if
I have a taste?!

11:18.250 --> 11:20.709
You don't eat it,
you little baboon.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.125
What does this thing do?!

11:22.209 --> 11:23.959
If you can manage
to sit on this cloud

11:24.042 --> 11:25.834
it can fly you
wherever you want.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.167
There's got to be
some kind of hitch.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.792
You wouldn't
be giving it away.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.084
Something's wrong
with it, right?!

11:30.167 --> 11:32.959
Hm?! There's nothing
wrong with this cloud.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.667
Hey. Can I try to ride it now?

11:35.750 --> 11:38.792
Sure, why not?!
But... I must warn you.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.459
You have to be pure of
heart to ride this cloud.

11:41.542 --> 11:42.625
[GOKU] Hm?

11:42.709 --> 11:44.084
Yep, otherwise it won't
let you get on it.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.459
It's picky that way.

11:45.542 --> 11:46.917
Wow.

11:47.584 --> 11:50.917
Here. Let an old man
show you how it's done!

11:51.000 --> 11:52.542
[ROSHI grunts]

11:52.625 --> 11:55.292
[laughs]

11:57.459 --> 11:58.292
[laughs]

11:58.375 --> 12:00.084
[TURTLE]
Are you okay, Master?!

12:00.834 --> 12:03.459
You must have done
something naughty.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.084
Be quiet.

12:05.167 --> 12:06.750
Now let me try it.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
[BOTH] Huh?!

12:10.584 --> 12:11.834
[GOKU] Wow.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.000
Yeah! Alright.
I did it! I did it!

12:14.084 --> 12:15.792
--[GOKU] I really did it!
--[TURTLE] He did it, Master.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.459
I'll be darned.
There goes my cloud.

12:18.542 --> 12:19.875
I did it! Woo hoo!

12:38.000 --> 12:41.792
[SHU humming]

12:41.875 --> 12:43.500
[PILAF] Shut up, Shu!
Pay attention.

12:43.584 --> 12:45.209
[SHU] Sorry, Sire.

12:45.292 --> 12:47.459
Is there any sign
of the island yet?

12:47.542 --> 12:49.042
[MAI] Negative.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.792
Hey. There it is.
Take her down.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.334
[SHU] Right away, Sire!

12:54.417 --> 12:55.542
[ALL] Huh?

12:55.625 --> 12:59.459
[MAI, SHU, and PILAF scream]

13:10.917 --> 13:13.125
[MAI] Wow. Nice house
for a turtle-hermit.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.750
[SHU] Yeah, I wonder
if he's hiring?

13:14.834 --> 13:17.250
You imbecile!
Let's get on with it!

13:17.334 --> 13:19.750
Get the Dragon Ball
and don't you dare screw up!

13:19.834 --> 13:20.917
[SHU and MAI] Sir!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.209
[PILAF] Now follow me.

13:22.292 --> 13:25.750
[running breaths]

13:25.834 --> 13:27.959
[laughs]

13:28.042 --> 13:31.042
Telegram. Hello?!

13:31.125 --> 13:33.459
[PILAF] Special delivery.
Telegram! Hello?!

13:33.542 --> 13:34.917
Is anybody home?!

13:35.000 --> 13:37.084
Good. The place is empty.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.625
[chuckles]

13:40.250 --> 13:43.209
[SHU] I got a great idea.
Let's just break in.

13:43.292 --> 13:45.042
"Break in"?!

13:45.125 --> 13:47.042
I like your style, Shu.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.959
But when in the presence
of a brilliant mind,

13:49.042 --> 13:51.584
there is seldom need
for brute force.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.500
Now. Where did I
put that thing?!

13:57.917 --> 13:59.459
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

13:59.542 --> 14:02.042
[PILAF] My Universal Key is
just the thing for this job.

14:02.125 --> 14:04.459
We could smash
right in, but hey!

14:04.542 --> 14:06.459
That's not the way I operate.

14:07.584 --> 14:09.625
[PILAF] There. That's it.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.292
Hey. What's the deal?!

14:11.375 --> 14:14.959
[grunting]

14:15.042 --> 14:18.209
Look Emperor! This window
was open the whole time!

14:18.292 --> 14:19.209
Huh?

14:19.292 --> 14:22.042
I'll open the door... Wait.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.084
Ah! Eh...

14:25.500 --> 14:30.084
[GOKU laughing]

14:30.167 --> 14:31.667
Yeah, whoa!

14:31.750 --> 14:33.625
[laughs]

14:33.709 --> 14:35.709
Wee!

14:35.792 --> 14:38.375
All right! Yeah. [chuckles]

14:38.459 --> 14:39.750
Whoa!

14:39.834 --> 14:42.667
[laughing continues]

14:42.750 --> 14:45.042
Whoa! Whoopie!

14:47.875 --> 14:49.459
Whoopie!

14:49.542 --> 14:51.375
Hey, down there.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.542
Whoa!

14:53.625 --> 14:56.209
Wow. It's great.
Thanks. I love it.

14:56.292 --> 14:57.500
[ROSHI] You fly
that thing like you've

14:57.584 --> 14:59.292
had it your whole life.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.709
[chuckles]

15:00.792 --> 15:02.250
[GOKU] See ya.

15:03.334 --> 15:04.792
Hey, yo.
What about me?!

15:04.875 --> 15:06.000
Hm?

15:06.084 --> 15:08.000
Aren't you going to
give me a gift, too?!

15:08.084 --> 15:09.125
Whatd'ya say?!

15:09.209 --> 15:10.917
Did this young lady
help you as well?!

15:11.000 --> 15:12.917
Oh, no. Just the boy.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.417
[BULMA] Hey! What about
the seawater I gave you?!

15:15.500 --> 15:16.750
[ROSHI] Hmm...

15:16.834 --> 15:18.750
I think I have to side
with Turtle on this one...

15:18.834 --> 15:21.792
But I could be persuaded
to change my mind...

15:21.875 --> 15:23.167
[ROSHI] For instance...

15:23.250 --> 15:26.667
if, uh, you were to
let me see your underwear...

15:26.750 --> 15:28.459
You wanna see my...

15:28.542 --> 15:31.292
Master. What are you doing?!

15:31.375 --> 15:33.792
[BULMA] You can't be serious!

15:35.125 --> 15:36.584
Eh huh!

15:36.667 --> 15:38.542
Have you forgotten
your code, Master.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.334
Please. That's wrong.
Dead wrong.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.875
Oh hush up, will ya?

15:41.959 --> 15:43.875
Can't a master take
a break from training

15:43.959 --> 15:45.667
and have a little fun?

15:45.750 --> 15:49.375
Now I understand why you
couldn't ride your cloud...

15:49.459 --> 15:51.084
Bite your tongue.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.209
[BULMA]
This is so embarrassing...

15:53.292 --> 15:56.209
I can't believe I'm...
doing this...

15:57.917 --> 15:59.334
[ROSHI and TURTLE] Aah!

15:59.417 --> 16:00.709
[yells]

16:00.792 --> 16:03.084
Ta da!

16:03.667 --> 16:05.542
[grunts]

16:05.625 --> 16:07.667
There. Done. 
That's it.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.292
Oh, my eyes...
I think I'm blind...

16:10.375 --> 16:11.792
I'm gonna faint...

16:11.875 --> 16:13.959
It serves you right!

16:14.042 --> 16:16.750
All right.
So, where's my gift at?!

16:16.834 --> 16:18.959
Oh, right! Sure! The gift!

16:19.042 --> 16:22.000
Well... I have one in mind!

16:22.084 --> 16:24.292
[ROSHI] Let's see,
I could give her the...

16:24.375 --> 16:26.417
No, not that,
the wheels fell off...

16:26.500 --> 16:27.792
Well, what about the...

16:27.875 --> 16:29.292
[BULMA] Huh?

16:32.334 --> 16:34.500
Nevermind. Nevermind!
I know what I want!

16:34.584 --> 16:36.834
Mm. Yeah? You do? What?

16:36.917 --> 16:38.334
That! I want that!

16:38.417 --> 16:40.542
That thing right there that's
hanging around your neck!

16:40.625 --> 16:44.250
What? This?! You sure
you want this old thing?

16:44.334 --> 16:47.625
I found it washed up on
my island a long time ago.

16:47.709 --> 16:50.334
Oh, it's beautiful...

16:51.250 --> 16:54.334
[BULMA] The three-star ball.
I can't believe it.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.542
[BULMA] Hey! Goku!

16:55.625 --> 16:56.917
[GOKU] Huh?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.334
[BULMA] Come here! I've got
something to show you.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.125
[GOKU] Okay!

17:00.209 --> 17:01.125
What?

17:01.209 --> 17:03.209
Look. It's another
Dragon Ball!

17:03.292 --> 17:04.875
Ah...!

17:04.959 --> 17:06.459
It sure is, isn't it!

17:06.541 --> 17:08.375
Our fourth Dragon Ball.

17:08.459 --> 17:09.916
A Dragon...
What'd you call it?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.375
So aren't you glad
that we decided

17:11.459 --> 17:13.584
to help the turtle
now?! It paid off.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.791
I sure am.
You were so right.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.459
And now just three
more then, wish time!

17:18.541 --> 17:19.459
[GOKU] Yeah.

17:19.541 --> 17:22.000
What?! That thing
grants wishes?!

17:22.084 --> 17:23.709
[GOKU] What a great day.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.791
Thank you.
We really love our gifts.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.959
You're a kind-hearted
and generous man.

17:28.041 --> 17:29.542
Thanks so much.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.709
I never said
you could have the ball.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.750
[BULMA] But you said you were
going to give me a gift.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.459
Can I have it? Please?!

17:35.542 --> 17:37.209
Aw, come on.

17:37.292 --> 17:38.625
There! Huh?

17:38.709 --> 17:39.542
[laughs]

17:39.625 --> 17:41.000
Ehhh...!

17:41.084 --> 17:43.792
[ROSHI] I give up.
It's yours. Take it.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.084
Yay!

17:45.167 --> 17:46.917
[laughs]

17:47.000 --> 17:50.334
Woo-hoo-hoo! Oh-ho!

17:50.417 --> 17:53.000
[engine revs]

17:53.084 --> 17:54.209
[GOKU] Goodbye, Turtle Hermit.

17:54.292 --> 17:55.625
--[BULMA] So long. 
--[GOKU] Thanks a lot.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.167
--[BULMA] Bye, bye.
--[GOKU] See ya later.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.125
[ROSHI] Boy! I tell ya,
these kids nowadays.

17:59.209 --> 18:00.542
They're like little piranhas.

18:00.625 --> 18:01.709
I was lucky
to get out of there

18:01.792 --> 18:03.625
with my staff and sandals.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.584
[tires screech]

18:11.667 --> 18:13.459
[BULMA] Man! I never thought
things would be going this well!

18:13.542 --> 18:15.667
We only need
three more Dragon Balls.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.292
I guess it was
meant to be, kiddo.

18:19.459 --> 18:22.584
Ahh! Wow! I wish
Grandpa could see me now.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.375
[BULMA screams]

18:25.500 --> 18:27.417
[GOKU] Hold on Bulma,
I'm coming!

18:27.500 --> 18:30.334
What's going on
in here? What's wrong?!

18:30.417 --> 18:33.375
M-M-My underwear
was here on the floor...

18:33.459 --> 18:36.000
Uh... I'm afraid to look.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.959
Awe...

18:40.042 --> 18:42.917
They're not there!

18:43.000 --> 18:44.792
[BULMA] Oh, that
means on the beach...

18:44.875 --> 18:47.500
that old man... oh boy...

18:47.584 --> 18:50.084
Oh, is that all?
Well that's okay, Bulma.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.209
That's right where I put 'em!

18:52.292 --> 18:54.000
What are you talking about?

18:54.084 --> 18:56.834
After I took 'em
off this morning.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.917
Are you saying that
you took my underwear off

18:59.000 --> 19:01.042
while I was sleeping
this morning?! Huh?!

19:01.125 --> 19:02.084
[GOKU] I sure did.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.125
These underwear?!

19:03.209 --> 19:05.917
Yep! They're the ones. Huh?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.084
[BULMA grunting]

19:07.167 --> 19:08.292
[GOKU] What are you
doing, Bulma?!

19:08.375 --> 19:10.417
[BULMA yells]

19:10.500 --> 19:12.292
[GOKU] Ow, ow! Owie! Ow!

19:16.167 --> 19:19.542
[GAY-TOR humming]

19:19.625 --> 19:20.459
Huh?

19:20.542 --> 19:21.959
Hmm. Mm.

19:22.042 --> 19:24.959
[MAI] This is disgusting. Ugh!

19:25.042 --> 19:27.417
[PILAF] Darn it.
Where is that Dragon Ball?!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.459
[SHU] It's not up here, Sire.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.084
Or down here.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.167
[MAI] It's not in the
kitchen either, Emperor.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.334
It's possible that
someone tipped him off.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.292
[PILAF]
I wonder... Wait here!

19:39.334 --> 19:40.292
[PILAF] Huh?

19:40.375 --> 19:42.417
[exhales loudly]

19:42.500 --> 19:44.292
[PILAF] Hey, there.
Nice day, isn't it?!

19:44.375 --> 19:45.500
Huh?

19:45.584 --> 19:47.000
[yells]

19:47.084 --> 19:48.792
You'd better tell me
what I want to know,

19:48.875 --> 19:51.042
or I'll make a
green handbag out of you!

19:51.125 --> 19:52.292
Okay...

19:52.375 --> 19:54.542
Where did this
"Roshi the Turtle Hermit" go?

19:54.625 --> 19:56.625
Master Roshi?
He's right there, buddy.

19:56.709 --> 19:57.875
Right where?! Aaah!

19:57.959 --> 19:59.584
[PILAF] Shu! Mai!

20:00.709 --> 20:02.167
[MAI] What is it?!

20:02.250 --> 20:03.584
[PILAF] Keep me covered.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.417
I don't think we've met. Hi.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.875
Hi. Now hand it over.
The Dragon Ball.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.000
What ball?!

20:10.084 --> 20:11.209
[SHU] Yeah!
That's right, needle-nose.

20:11.292 --> 20:13.167
[MAI] You heard the man.
Now cough it up.

20:13.250 --> 20:16.084
Dragon...? Oh, I remember.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.959
I just gave it to that
pretty girl on the beach.

20:19.042 --> 20:20.334
[PILAF] Are you kidding?!

20:20.417 --> 20:22.167
[ROSHI] Seriously.
She wouldn't leave me alone

20:22.250 --> 20:23.667
until I gave it to her.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.917
She was nuts about that ball
because of some crazy wish.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.125
[SHU] Huh?!

20:28.209 --> 20:29.250
--[MAI] Huh?!
--[SHU] Doesn't sound good.

20:29.334 --> 20:31.292
I want to know
where that girl is at.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.500
[ROSHI] I don't know.
But I just said goodbye to her

20:33.584 --> 20:34.500
--[ROSHI] by the sh--shore...
--[PILAF] She couldn't have

20:34.584 --> 20:36.625
gotten too far!
Come on! Let's go.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.084
[SHU and MAI] Right.

20:39.584 --> 20:42.292
Engaging amphibious
transformation.

20:46.084 --> 20:47.542
[PILAF]
Uh, hello there! Yoo, hoo.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.417
Would you mind
giving us a little push?!

20:49.500 --> 20:51.209
[ROSHI] Anything to
get you off my island,

20:51.292 --> 20:52.750
you blue-faced dwarf!

20:52.834 --> 20:53.875
[PILAF] Hurry up!

20:53.959 --> 20:55.750
[ROSHI] Yeah, yeah!
Keep your hat on.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.500
[ROSHI grunts]

20:59.584 --> 21:01.042
Oopsie, Daisy!

21:01.125 --> 21:02.542
[chuckles]

21:02.625 --> 21:04.584
[ROSHI] Bon voyage.

21:05.917 --> 21:08.750
[ROSHI] Goodbye!
Enjoy the bottom of the sea.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.459
[PILAF] Thank you.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.042
Those three deserve
the hole I put in their side.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.250
Too bad.
It was a nice plane.

21:16.334 --> 21:18.834
[PILAF] Shu! Step on it.
We're going too slow.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.709
[SHU] Eye, eye, skipper.

21:22.084 --> 21:23.542
[BULMA] Ready and presto.

21:23.625 --> 21:24.792
[GOKU yells]

21:24.875 --> 21:26.542
[BULMA] Now that's what
I call house-cleaning.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.709
[chuckles]

21:27.792 --> 21:29.084
[GOKU] Don't scare me
like that, Bulma.

21:29.167 --> 21:30.875
[BULMA] Okay!
I'll warn you next time.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.167
I guess we'll both
take the Flying Nimbus.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.500
It'll be faster.

21:35.584 --> 21:37.167
[GOKU] But didn't Master Roshi
say you have to be

21:37.250 --> 21:39.250
pure of heart to ride
the Flying Nimbus?

21:39.334 --> 21:40.542
What's that supposed to mean?!

21:40.625 --> 21:43.292
I'm probably the
purest person you know.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.417
[GOKU] All right.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.917
[GOKU] Go ahead!
Give it a try.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.834
[BULMA] Uh...! Uh!

21:49.959 --> 21:51.875
Pure, huh?! [chuckles]

21:51.959 --> 21:54.250
Ooh! Now my
clothes are dirty.

21:54.334 --> 21:57.959
Darn it. I didn't want to
ride that stupid cloud anyway.

22:04.834 --> 22:05.792
[GOKU] Kind of slow, huh?!

22:05.875 --> 22:07.042
[BULMA] Oh, just hush up.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.334
Nobody likes
a show-off, you know.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.084
[SHU]
There's that smell again...

22:12.167 --> 22:13.417
[MAI] Man! That's toxic.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.625
[PILAF] Oh, yeah. Well,
whoever smelt it dealt it.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.667
Right, Shu?!

22:16.750 --> 22:18.084
[SHU] Yes, Sire.

22:18.167 --> 22:19.500
Huh?!

22:19.584 --> 22:21.625
[NARRATOR] As the villains
sink with the setting sun,

22:21.709 --> 22:23.667
our heroes'
adventure continues.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.000
Join us again
next time as Goku and Bulma

22:26.084 --> 22:27.459
once again
further their quest

22:27.542 --> 22:30.459
to unite the seven
magic Dragon Balls.
