WEBVTT

00:08.399 --> 00:11.620
I don't know.
I feel like...

00:11.663 --> 00:14.492
I feel like these shoes are
at a different party.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.800
You know?
One where fun goes to die.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.020
So less corporate,
more red carpet?

00:20.063 --> 00:21.499
I think so. Great.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.110
Thanks, Roxanne.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.112
I really appreciate
you jumping in.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.462
Ali usually helps me
with big events,

00:27.505 --> 00:30.726
but she's doing
an internship abroad and...

00:30.769 --> 00:32.467
No problem. Okay.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.948
These should put the fun
in fundraiser.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.689
Oh, yeah. See?

00:37.733 --> 00:39.822
Now, look.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.042
This is why women
have a thing about shoes.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.087
They do?

00:44.131 --> 00:45.567
Well, that's news to me.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.047
Oh, hey, handsome.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.700
I love you in that old thing.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.920
It never gets old. That's
why it's a classic.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.923
It certainly is. Okay, I got to go over
and work on my remarks.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.055
No, d-don't touch.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.796
All right.
Good seeing you, Roxanne.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.843
Well, I think we got a winner.
What do you think?

01:00.886 --> 01:01.974
Yeah.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.846
There's just one
other wardrobe issue

01:03.889 --> 01:05.194
we should discuss
moving forward.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.197
It's about your husband.

01:07.241 --> 01:10.418
So you'll at least want to get a
drive-by with Senator Wagner.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.942
He has a sweet tooth, so
target the dessert table.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.007
And, uh, Senator Langston might
be a little harder to pin down.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.989
Oh, Sydney and
Louise Winters's winery

01:17.033 --> 01:18.967
had a great harvest coming off
an award-winning year,

01:18.991 --> 01:20.732
so you can lean on them
to up their grant.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.125
Just for one night,

01:22.169 --> 01:26.477
can we not think about
fundraising or votes?

01:26.521 --> 01:30.742
Come on. This event actually
has the potential to be fun.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.657
You might be
in the wrong profession, ma'am.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.983
I said "one night," Blake. I'm
not having a vocational crisis.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.009
Good to know. But this is Henry's
night to shine,

01:37.053 --> 01:41.797
so I am perfectly justified
staying out of the spotlight.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.234
Yes, ma'am.

01:44.278 --> 01:48.586
Oh, it's the McCords,
in glamorous formal wear.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.979
I feel itchy. Oh, youfeel itchy?

01:50.022 --> 01:52.895
Well, y-you look really g...
That looks great.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.028
You have on writer's face.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.615
What... No, I had writer's face before.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.119
This is public remarks face.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.250
Oh. Well, okay.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.470
Let's do this.Okay.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.167
Thank you.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.169
Okay.

02:16.223 --> 02:20.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
President Elizabeth McCord

02:20.183 --> 02:22.751
and First Gentleman
Dr. Henry McCord.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.761
Madam Secretary,
it's a pleasure to see you.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.633
And you, too, Madam President.

02:35.677 --> 02:40.203
Is Minister Chen playing nice
on the Taiwanese negotiations?

02:40.247 --> 02:42.684
Oh, I've got his number.
I think he misses you.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.121
Excuse me.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.079
Hi, you. MIKE:
Senators Windbag

02:47.123 --> 02:48.733
and Expediency are
here as expected.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.518
Good to see you.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.173
Good evening, Mike. Not if we can't get
your wildly unrealistic,

02:53.216 --> 02:55.175
giving-me-palpitations
legislative meatball

02:55.218 --> 02:56.456
over the finish line. Thank you.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.221
You have votes to whip,
lady. I mean, Madam.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.136
President. I was sort of hoping

03:00.180 --> 03:01.833
to take the night off.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.922
So, Wagner likes
to feel important.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.074
So just act like you're there
seeking his brilliant counsel

03:06.098 --> 03:07.665
and actually give a crap

03:07.709 --> 03:09.101
about his spectacular
blowhardery.

03:09.145 --> 03:12.192
That and he likes to brag
about bringing home the bacon

03:12.235 --> 03:13.671
to his constituents.

03:13.715 --> 03:17.066
Langston is an idealist
but responds to power,

03:17.109 --> 03:18.937
so just pummel her.

03:18.981 --> 03:22.245
Isn't it a bit unseemly
for the president to pummel?

03:22.289 --> 03:26.249
Failure is unseemlier, and your
hundredth day in office looms.

03:29.252 --> 03:33.082
Now, see, that's something that
we can all reach consensus on.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.953
We ought to
chocolate-cover every bill

03:34.997 --> 03:37.956
that comes to the
floor, Madam President.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.350
Thanks for coming out tonight,
Senator Wagner.

03:40.394 --> 03:43.919
Any chance to hear that
scholarly husband of yours talk.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.313
Well, that's nice to hear.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.881
Be even nicer to hear if I had
your support for the ESI bill.

03:49.925 --> 03:53.581
I support
the infrastructure piece,

03:53.624 --> 03:56.714
but some of my colleagues and I
have concerns

03:56.758 --> 03:59.848
about the education handouts.

04:00.936 --> 04:04.896
Well, we can't have
next-gen infrastructure

04:04.940 --> 04:08.596
without innovations in science,
and we can't lead in science

04:08.639 --> 04:09.919
without investing
in education...

04:09.945 --> 04:12.817
The hip bone's connected
to the thigh bone.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.839
I've heard your pitch, ma'am,
but the people of Alabama

04:14.863 --> 04:16.952
don't care about
the body politic.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.998
They care about
runaway spending.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.738
Do you think

04:21.783 --> 04:25.743
that those concerns
might be allayed if we make sure

04:25.787 --> 04:27.919
contracts for rebuilding
Alabama's schools

04:27.963 --> 04:31.793
only go to local
construction companies?

04:33.360 --> 04:38.278
That might be just the chocolate
fix they need, Madam President.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.107
Before you all knew him

04:42.151 --> 04:45.850
as the First Gentleman
of the United States,

04:45.894 --> 04:48.940
he was known in many circles
for other things.

04:48.984 --> 04:52.857
Fighter pilot, religious
scholar, acclaimed author,

04:52.901 --> 04:54.903
White House advisor.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.426
Clearly, he did
the best he could

04:56.470 --> 04:58.254
with the limited talents he had.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.954
Please welcome Dr. Henry McCord.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.178
Thank you, Patricia.
Thank you very much.

05:09.221 --> 05:12.790
Well, it's true, I've had
a blessed and weird life

05:12.834 --> 05:14.966
and I've pursued
some challenging paths.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.795
But what you probably don't know
is that I could never have been

05:17.839 --> 05:21.843
any of those things
without poetry.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.367
I mean, here I was,
this goofy, working-class kid

05:24.411 --> 05:28.806
from Pittsburgh without a single
interesting thought in my mind.

05:28.850 --> 05:32.070
And then, in high school, I had
this great teacher, Mr. Eastman,

05:32.114 --> 05:36.945
who made me read Gerard Manley
Hopkins and Emily Dickinson

05:36.988 --> 05:40.949
and Langston Hughes
and Blaise Pascal.

05:40.992 --> 05:45.083
These were theologians,
philosophers, innovators

05:45.127 --> 05:46.476
and artists.

05:46.520 --> 05:50.959
And suddenly,
my mind caught fire.

05:51.002 --> 05:55.006
I... the way they used words
just lit up my imagination

05:55.050 --> 05:59.968
and expanded my concept
of the divine.

06:00.011 --> 06:03.841
They ignited all my passions
and put them in one place.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.105
In his poem "High Flight,"

06:07.149 --> 06:10.500
John Gillespie Magee Jr. wrote,

06:10.544 --> 06:14.374
"Oh, I have slipped
the surly bonds of earth,

06:14.417 --> 06:17.855
And danced the skies
on laughter-silvered wings."

06:17.899 --> 06:20.858
When I read that passage,
I instantly knew two things:

06:20.902 --> 06:24.993
I wanted to study theology
and I wanted to fly.

06:26.168 --> 06:29.301
Artists have inspired me
to do everything

06:29.345 --> 06:32.043
that's meaningful in my life.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.437
I may have even leaned on
a little Keats and Shakespeare

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
when I was wooing
my beautiful wife.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.358
There is nothing that drives

06:42.402 --> 06:46.014
our world-leading economy
like creativity,

06:46.057 --> 06:50.845
and there is nothing that drives
creativity like the arts.

06:50.888 --> 06:55.850
It is vital that we foster them
and invest in them.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.504
Thank you very much.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.509
Don't tell people this, but...

07:02.552 --> 07:05.033
Thomas Aquinas walks
into a bar...

07:05.076 --> 07:08.558
I'm so sorry to pull rank, but
the first gentleman is needed

07:08.602 --> 07:10.473
for an emergency
dancing situation,

07:10.517 --> 07:11.909
and it can't be helped.Sorry.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.216
Can't say no to the chief.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.306
â™ª

07:17.349 --> 07:19.351
Well, hello.Hello.

07:21.136 --> 07:24.444
We haven't danced like this
since the inaugural ball.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.576
We haven't danced at
all since then.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.926
Well, there was
that midnight Macarena moment.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.276
Okay, that was fun.

07:35.063 --> 07:39.284
You know, sometimes I just can't
believe this is all real.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.982
Right?

07:41.025 --> 07:42.940
The only way I know
this isn't a dream

07:42.984 --> 07:45.073
is because I can
still work my phone.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.204
What?

07:46.248 --> 07:50.339
You can't work technology
in your dream.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.123
You're crazy. Yes, you can.No. You can't.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.821
I can. Yes, I can. No, you can't.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.257
It's scientifically proven.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.955
Oh, yeah? What... who
are the scientists... Yeah.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.348
That did this experiment?

07:59.391 --> 08:01.306
Well, I'm going to get
somebody on it.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.358
I love you, Henry McCord.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.969
I love you, Madam President.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.015
â™ª

08:19.542 --> 08:21.501
You can't beat this commute.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.980
No.From now on,

08:23.024 --> 08:24.939
let's only have jobs
that are in our house.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.331
I agree.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.072
Well, I go left here.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.987
Okay, have a good day.
Keep an open mind.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.423
About what?

08:32.207 --> 08:34.339
Anything that comes up.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.688
Elizabeth...

08:35.732 --> 08:37.318
It's just all-around
solid advice. I love you.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.431
Uh... Morning,
Dr. McCord.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.019
Good morning, Evan. Last night's speech
already paying dividends.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.195
Well, let's hear it. Two more senators
and five House members

08:44.219 --> 08:46.090
signed on to your increased
NEA-funding push.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.614
My kind of dividends.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.877
And you're confirmed for
Colbertthis afternoon.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.183
Cool. And terrifying. Flying
out of Andrews at 1300.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.359
Um, and Jason's definitely
coming with, right?

08:54.403 --> 08:57.058
I'll make sure he's got a seat.
And you have a visitor.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.888
Roxanne.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.629
This is a surprise. Really, Dr. McCord?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.892
I convinced the
commander in chief.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.069
Meet your new wardrobe.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.202
Oh, hey.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.595
Good timing.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.902
I know I haven't brought this up
lately, or today,

09:14.945 --> 09:17.513
but this is day 98, which
means only two more days

09:17.557 --> 09:19.056
until I can quit. I know. I know, Mike.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.168
Do you, though?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.387
Yes. I-I have
your shortlist on my desk.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.563
Actually, here it is again,

09:23.606 --> 09:24.714
because I fished it
out from the pile

09:24.738 --> 09:25.932
and gingerly blew
the dust off of it.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.480
You haven't brought
any of those people in.

09:28.524 --> 09:31.222
I will. Yes, you will, because
the leader of the free world

09:31.266 --> 09:32.920
would not go back on her word.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.922
No, she wouldn't.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.577
Look, I don't want the
job Jay Whitman rejected.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.709
I want the job you promised me:

09:39.753 --> 09:41.232
counselor to the president.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.234
Behind the scenes,
under the radar.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.063
Cracking heads
and crushing enemies.

09:46.107 --> 09:49.414
But you're so good
at being my chief of staff.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.592
Acting chief of staff,
and of course I'm amazing at it.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.245
But I hate it.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.030
It's all relationships
and people.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.380
So many people... in person.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.209
Well, I'm gonna need
some more time.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.080
No. No, that was not the deal.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.083
I agreed to filling in
for the first 100 days.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.519
We shook on it.

10:07.563 --> 10:10.261
Don't punish me because Jay
had a mental breakdown.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.567
It wasn't a breakdown.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.221
Total breakdown. It was love.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.547
What's the difference? The kid
walked out on his dream job.

10:15.571 --> 10:16.703
For what? A chess player?

10:16.746 --> 10:19.009
To be happy? From Holland?

10:19.053 --> 10:20.663
That's sexy. To start a family?

10:20.707 --> 10:23.144
To not end up alone?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.624
Oh, what's that?

10:24.667 --> 10:27.104
Clearly,
things you don't care about.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.126
Yeah, and I cannot care about those
things... Exactly why you are perfect

10:29.150 --> 10:31.030
for this job....when I have the job
that I want.

10:31.065 --> 10:34.024
Okay, I hear you.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.635
Until then? Whip count is 58

10:35.678 --> 10:37.569
after you secured Langston
and Wagner last night.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.987
Well, that's great. It's great-adjacent.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.139
We're still two votes shy
of a filibuster-proof majority,

10:42.163 --> 10:44.358
so start thinking about which kid you're
willing to sacrifice. Good morning, ma'am.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.533
Good morning. Lemon poppyseed.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.472
What did you call me?

10:47.516 --> 10:50.316
You really need to calm down. And see?
He's back to being an assistant.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.652
Uh, ROTUS. Receptionist
of the United States.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.479
That's worse. That's a promotion.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.872
That's how she gets you.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.676
Okay. Ma'am, Ephraim Ware
and FBI Director Banks

10:57.700 --> 10:59.156
are in your office.
They say it's urgent.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.442
More urgent than passing

11:00.485 --> 11:01.443
the most ambitious
legislative tour de force

11:01.486 --> 11:02.836
of the century? Morning.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.360
New intel on the Knights
of Western Freedom or...?

11:05.403 --> 11:08.015
No, ma'am. It's Iran.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.581
That's never good.

11:09.625 --> 11:10.985
Madam President,
yesterday morning,

11:11.018 --> 11:13.585
I received a call
from my counterpart in Mossad.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.762
During an Israeli
counterintelligence operation,

11:15.805 --> 11:18.373
agents came across
court documents

11:18.416 --> 11:21.332
from Senator Beauregard Miller's
divorce on a VAJA server.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.813
Which documents? Same ones

11:23.857 --> 11:25.095
about Miller cheating
on his wife,

11:25.119 --> 11:26.618
fathering a child with
one of his staffers

11:26.642 --> 11:29.036
that were leaked to a
reporter during the campaign.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.603
And Mossad thinks
the Iranians hacked them?

11:31.647 --> 11:33.562
Yes, ma'am, and the
Bureau's own metadata

11:33.605 --> 11:37.087
and friends at code analysis
confirm Iranian origin.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.499
- Let's not panic.
- Valerie Guillen,

11:38.523 --> 11:39.631
from The Chronicle,
she broke the story.

11:39.655 --> 11:40.676
What does she have to say?

11:40.700 --> 11:41.657
She's not giving up her source.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.876
But she denies

11:42.919 --> 11:44.157
receiving the documents
from the Iranians.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.202
She could have gotten them

11:45.226 --> 11:46.575
through a third party.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.359
If I may, ma'am.

11:48.403 --> 11:52.755
Our working theory is that Iran
targeted Miller's campaign

11:52.799 --> 11:56.585
because of his aggressively
anti-Iranian positions,

11:56.628 --> 11:59.762
and because he was
a harsh critic

11:59.806 --> 12:03.374
of your role in
landing the Iran peace deal.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.724
Okay, now we can panic.

12:06.421 --> 12:10.120
I want to know exactly
what happened, and who

12:10.164 --> 12:12.383
in the Iranian leadership
was responsible. Thank you.

12:12.427 --> 12:15.082
We're on it. You bet, Madam President.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.825
Gather the NSC.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.088
I want CYBERCOM

12:21.131 --> 12:24.091
to draw up severe
countermeasures.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.399
If it gets out that Iran
tried to tank

12:28.443 --> 12:30.445
your biggest rival's campaign
in order to help you,

12:30.488 --> 12:34.101
it could taint the
legitimacy of your election.

12:34.144 --> 12:38.322
This is much bigger
than my election.

12:38.366 --> 12:41.238
Our democracy was attacked
by a foreign power,

12:41.282 --> 12:43.588
and we have to defend it
at all costs.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.771
â™ª

13:03.521 --> 13:06.829
Really, the... the AC is up

13:06.873 --> 13:07.917
full throttle?

13:07.961 --> 13:09.571
Afraid so, ma'am.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.573
Whew.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.837
Oh, my God.
What is that smell?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.274
Is somebody sick? No, no, no, I think

13:17.318 --> 13:20.277
somebody left some, uh,
egg salad on the, uh...

13:20.321 --> 13:21.844
Under the seats last night.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.604
They're working on it.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go check.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.456
Here's some good news, ma'am.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.328
I just heard that Sprinkles
is going

13:27.371 --> 13:29.156
to name a cupcake after you.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.854
Polls are that bad?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.290
Ma'am?

13:35.336 --> 13:38.818
If the cupcake thing
is the good news...

13:38.861 --> 13:41.298
No, actually, Hubbard dropped
a point or two today.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.473
You held.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.911
So I'm only four points
behind Hubbard?

13:44.954 --> 13:46.390
Yes. And
Miller's spread

13:46.434 --> 13:48.697
is all over the place,
depending on the poll.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.655
Give me Quinnipiac.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.440
Fourteen.

13:52.483 --> 13:55.356
Geez!

13:55.399 --> 13:58.315
He got that big of a bump
from The View?

13:58.359 --> 14:00.119
Well, he made salmon tacos.
They look good. MIKE: Hello?

14:00.143 --> 14:05.670
Welcome to the best day
of your lives so far.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.499
What is that smell...
It doesn't matter.

14:08.543 --> 14:09.805
It doesn't matter.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.502
I got a tip
from my Chronicleguy.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.504
Story breaks tomorrow.
Miller...

14:13.548 --> 14:15.419
cheated on his wife

14:15.463 --> 14:17.528
and secretly fathered a child
with one of his staffers.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.921
What? Wow. Wait-wait-wait, wait-wait.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.661
Wait, did I say staffers?
Sorry, I meant intern.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.513
Wow.
Hey. Is there

14:22.557 --> 14:24.689
more, Mike? Why, yes.
Yes, there is.

14:24.733 --> 14:29.346
There is a tape of him
making a deal

14:29.390 --> 14:31.914
with his deputy chief of staff
to claim paternity.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.829
Holy crap.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.223
Are you sure?

14:36.266 --> 14:37.528
Above the fold tomorrow.

14:37.572 --> 14:38.941
This is it for him, right? Oh, absolutely.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.420
Now it's just a five-point
spread with Hubbard.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.924
I thought it was four.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.795
The-the point is, it's winnable.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.599
We're in this thing.Sorry. Who do we
think leaked this?

14:45.623 --> 14:47.321
Oh, I have no idea,
but I want to kiss them

14:47.364 --> 14:48.583
straight on the mouth.

14:48.626 --> 14:49.952
I never do this, let's do this.
Let's do it.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.238
No, Mike... Bring it up.

14:51.281 --> 14:55.938
No. It's... sad and sordid.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.767
You're right. You're right,
we'll take a moment.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.247
Celebrate when the smell
goes away.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.378
Be thinking about VPs.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.380
No more eggs on the bus, people!

15:04.773 --> 15:08.298
So the idea is, you cannot have
high-tech infrastructure

15:08.342 --> 15:11.040
without some serious
science behind it.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.626
And you can't have
the best scientific minds

15:12.650 --> 15:14.000
without education.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.264
Basically, human infrastructure

15:17.307 --> 15:19.570
begets physical infrastructure.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.573
Okay. I got to say,
I rarely hear the word

15:22.617 --> 15:23.966
"begets" outside of the Bible.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.882
Um...

15:26.926 --> 15:29.711
So... so go back. What is
"human infrastructure"?

15:29.754 --> 15:31.278
Do we have to make
human pyramids?

15:31.321 --> 15:32.844
Do I have to take
iron supplements?

15:32.888 --> 15:35.586
What is a human...? Well, only if
your doctor tells you.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.327
I... You are a doctor.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.025
Of-of philosophy.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.810
Uh, and a-a fighter pilot,
uh, an ethics advisor

15:41.853 --> 15:44.856
to former President Dalton,
a religious scholar, an author.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.815
Now you're championing, uh,

15:46.858 --> 15:49.818
arts in education. There's
a word for guys like you:

15:49.861 --> 15:52.777
annoying.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.955
I mean, you're married to the
president, for Pete's sake.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.957
Why can't you just
finally retire?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.307
Well, I-I-I can't because
what I really want

16:00.350 --> 16:01.699
is to have my own talk show.

16:01.743 --> 16:02.874
Really?

16:02.918 --> 16:04.746
Really? You might
be disappointed,

16:04.789 --> 16:07.444
because here are some words
you rarely hear on a talk show:

16:07.488 --> 16:09.838
"I read your book
on St. Francis."

16:09.881 --> 16:12.623
You're the guy, thank you. Yeah,

16:12.667 --> 16:14.886
you're welcome.
I had no idea that St. Frankie

16:14.930 --> 16:17.019
was such a playa. I mean...

16:17.063 --> 16:19.804
The guy... the guy partied.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.677
Yeah, well, once you start
talking to birds, you know...

16:22.720 --> 16:24.070
Yeah.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.637
This is funnier if you're
Catholic, by the way.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.771
I-I thought you were gonna say

16:29.814 --> 16:32.078
it's funnier if
you're a nerd.
That, too.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.601
Okay, so, uh...

16:33.644 --> 16:35.820
you're pretty busy.
I happen to know, uh,

16:35.864 --> 16:39.563
your wife, uh, has a few
obligations of her own.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.784
How do the two of you manage
to make time to see each other?

16:42.827 --> 16:44.655
Well... you know, it's tough.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.832
And sometimes it feels like we
can go weeks without,

16:47.876 --> 16:49.747
you know... Oh, I know.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.488
- Yeah.
- No...

16:51.532 --> 16:52.794
Oh. Oh, boy. Really? Weeks?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.709
Wow. No.Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.668
Seriously, though, uh...

16:59.453 --> 17:02.021
Cohabitating with
the first female president,

17:02.064 --> 17:04.371
uh, I mean, she's off
on Air Force One all the time;

17:04.414 --> 17:07.503
that makes the White House
your personal man cave.

17:07.548 --> 17:08.699
So, we wanted to help you out.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.942
We-we got... we got
you a present.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.075
Here-here you go.

17:13.118 --> 17:15.034
There it is.
We got you... Oh, wow.

17:16.731 --> 17:19.560
Wow. We got you your own...

17:19.603 --> 17:21.518
We got that...

17:21.561 --> 17:25.000
Your-your own
FGOTUS beer helmet.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.522
Oh, that's just
what I need, yeah.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.526
Uh, now if you... if you
push, uh, the button...

17:32.007 --> 17:34.096
There you go,
see? Classy.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.619
There you go.
We also...

17:37.665 --> 17:40.885
You should know...

17:40.929 --> 17:42.626
we also made...

17:42.670 --> 17:44.019
we also made a nuclear version,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.847
but you can only
push the button once.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.762
There you go.
First Gentleman

17:47.805 --> 17:51.113
of these United States,
Dr. Henry McCord, everybody.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.985
Give it up for the FGOTUS!

17:54.029 --> 17:57.163
We'll be right back.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.686
Thank you, sir.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.081
Whoo!

18:02.124 --> 18:04.083
Attack option one:
A DoS strike

18:04.126 --> 18:06.128
shutting down
Iranian government websites

18:06.172 --> 18:08.043
and disabling
the civilian Internet.

18:08.087 --> 18:12.003
Option two:
Knock out the power grid.

18:12.047 --> 18:16.095
And all comms, radio,
phone and satellite.

18:16.138 --> 18:20.621
Option three: A direct attack
on the Revolutionary Guard.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.927
We fry every piece
of military hardware

18:22.971 --> 18:24.015
with a data connection.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.583
From SRBMs to main battle tanks.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.803
Any of these would send
a clear message.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.937
Prepare to execute all three.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.765
Yes, ma'am.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.593
Susan, I want to follow

18:36.637 --> 18:38.093
with sanctions that go right up
to the line of what

18:38.117 --> 18:39.770
we can do given the peace deal.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.990
I'll have a plan on
your desk in two hours.

18:45.211 --> 18:49.780
If I were to declassify
all of this...

18:49.824 --> 18:53.784
would there be any
operational risks?

18:53.828 --> 18:55.482
Mossad says it was a pure hack.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.701
No human assets in play.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.008
The Israelis are good
with declassifying.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.490
Thank you, everyone.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.970
Thank you, Madam President.

19:06.014 --> 19:09.539
Brief Daisy. I'm holding a press conference
in an hour. Let's just take a beat.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.107
No. No political considerations.
This could kill the ESI bill,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.998
hobble your administration
before it's out of the gate.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.938
The American people
deserve to know, Mike. And they will.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.853
Just give it a few days.
Get ESI on the books.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.117
Brief Daisy now.

19:35.304 --> 19:38.002
Good afternoon.

19:38.046 --> 19:41.223
Earlier today, I received
an intelligence briefing

19:41.267 --> 19:42.790
about the discovery of a hack

19:42.833 --> 19:44.661
by the government of Iran
last year

19:44.705 --> 19:48.056
that resulted
in confidential information

19:48.099 --> 19:50.537
about Senator Beauregard Miller
being leaked

19:50.580 --> 19:53.235
during
the presidential campaign.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.593
And that's why
on my first day in office,

20:03.637 --> 20:05.334
I will bring Congress
my education,

20:05.378 --> 20:07.945
science and infrastructure plan.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.991
So please join me.

20:10.034 --> 20:13.864
And let's get it done, America.

20:13.908 --> 20:17.128
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, everybody.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.696
â™ª Show me the way

20:19.740 --> 20:20.871
â™ª Every day

20:20.915 --> 20:22.612
â™ª I want you...

20:22.656 --> 20:27.138
Ugh, these ribs are so good,
I might have to move here.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.836
It may not be a problem.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.753
What now, Chicken Little?

20:32.796 --> 20:35.190
The scandal didn't
hurt Miller in the polls.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.192
He could eat a baby
on national television,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.628
and his base wouldn't care

20:38.672 --> 20:41.588
as long as he panders
to their fears. Well,

20:41.631 --> 20:44.112
I've been thinking about
a major speech. On what?

20:44.155 --> 20:46.593
Your opponent
knocking up interns?

20:46.636 --> 20:48.247
Unity.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.862
I'm telling you,
it's what people want.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.796
It's what they're yearning for,
more than anything.
No,

20:56.820 --> 20:58.363
it's what they say
they're yearning for,

20:58.387 --> 21:00.278
but really, they just want to
bash each other's heads in.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.933
Do a speech on that. It might
actually be a crowd-pleaser. Oh, my God.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.065
The mac and cheese... Okay, I'm glad you're
enjoying your lunch,

21:05.089 --> 21:08.005
but we need to talk VPs.Oh! I've
been thinking about that, too.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.007
Me, too.
Todd Everlane,

21:10.051 --> 21:13.184
progressive young mayor
of Austin is trending.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.945
Gets the youth vote
and whatever, but also Texas.Yeah.

21:14.969 --> 21:18.320
Susan Thompson,
strong in foreign relations,

21:18.364 --> 21:20.385
uh, making a name for herself
at the State Department.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.758
You like her.Yeah. I love her.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.020
Okay.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.675
I was thinking Carlos Morejon.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.655
You were thinking that
right about the time

21:29.679 --> 21:30.811
the gummies kicked in?

21:32.682 --> 21:34.641
Why is it crazy?

21:34.684 --> 21:36.251
Because he would
never leave his party.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.837
He wouldn't have to. And you guys are
on the opposite sides

21:37.861 --> 21:39.515
of, I don't know, everything?

21:39.559 --> 21:41.798
Not everything. We... I-I also have it
on really good authority

21:41.822 --> 21:43.782
that he's on the top
of Miller's shortlist for VP,

21:43.824 --> 21:45.913
like, the tippy-top.

21:45.956 --> 21:48.176
No.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.309
Carlos is principled.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.712
He'd never do it. That's adorable.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.095
But nobody says no.
They all act like they will,

21:54.138 --> 21:57.446
but no politician's ego ever met
a principle it couldn't crush.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.143
Which is why I'm already
gathering oppo

21:59.187 --> 22:00.904
to wound Morejon
before they can even announce.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.035
We just have to hope
it's enough,

22:02.059 --> 22:04.323
and that's way too much
mac and cheese.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.981
That an attack
by a foreign power

22:11.025 --> 22:13.375
threw the election in her favor.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.812
She spent years improving
diplomatic relations

22:15.856 --> 22:18.337
with a sworn enemy
of the United States.

22:18.380 --> 22:21.775
This was a direct attack
on our democracy.

22:21.818 --> 22:24.821
Those responsible
must be held accountable,

22:24.865 --> 22:28.390
even if they reside
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

22:28.434 --> 22:32.002
For the sake of the nation,
we will leave no stone unturned

22:32.046 --> 22:34.701
in our investigation
into President McCord's campaign

22:34.744 --> 22:39.096
for any sign of collusion
with the Iranian regime.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.446
Hey, here's a neat feature.

22:40.489 --> 22:42.186
Oh.

22:42.230 --> 22:45.015
I can't believe Mike
was right about this.

22:45.059 --> 22:48.367
We shouldn't have had
that press conference.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.065
I didn't think that people
would be willing to use this

22:51.108 --> 22:53.720
as a pretext to go after us.

22:53.763 --> 22:57.071
Mike's trying to find a way
around this investigation,

22:57.114 --> 22:59.856
but I think that we should
fully cooperate, don't you?

22:59.900 --> 23:03.033
I think that if... I mean, we have
nothing to hide.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.339
And I don't want to give

23:04.383 --> 23:07.255
even the slightest appearance
of a cover-up.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.345
True, but if you... Right? How do you
win a fight

23:10.389 --> 23:13.000
where your opponent is willing
to hit below the belt

23:13.043 --> 23:15.524
and you're not?

23:19.136 --> 23:20.747
Henry?

23:22.009 --> 23:23.489
Oh, you're really asking?

23:23.532 --> 23:25.316
Yeah.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.057
Get out of the ring.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.495
Focus on the fight
that you really care about.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.322
The ESI bill.Yes.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.194
Don't let anyone
distract your team

23:33.237 --> 23:35.805
from getting it
over the finish line.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.547
Well, now this investigation
is providing enough cloud cover

23:38.591 --> 23:40.331
for some senators to waver.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.072
It's gonna be tight.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.901
All the more reason
to stay on point.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.904
Give the public something else
to talk about.

23:47.948 --> 23:51.125
Yeah. Maybe they'll be too busy
talking about our sex life.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.474
Okay.

23:52.518 --> 23:56.870
That is so not what I said.

23:56.913 --> 24:00.264
Colbert jumped on a moment
and he twisted it around...

24:00.308 --> 24:01.483
Trust me, I know.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.485
But you did hesitate.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.095
I was thinking.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.924
About how we did have more sex
before the election?

24:07.968 --> 24:11.145
We've had plenty
of post-election sex.

24:11.188 --> 24:13.103
Are we losing steam?

24:13.147 --> 24:14.322
No. We've got steam.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.585
We have... w-we've got plenty
of steam.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.239
We're fine.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.937
Is there maybe
a power imbalance?

24:20.981 --> 24:25.028
Like, you can't take charge
with your commander in chief?

24:25.072 --> 24:27.161
I mean, on some subtle,

24:27.204 --> 24:28.554
psychological level.

24:28.597 --> 24:32.253
My subtle psyche
can boss yours around any day.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.042
I find it sexy
that you're my commander.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.004
Please tell me what to say.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.319
Senate intelligence committee
chairman Mark Hanson

24:55.363 --> 24:57.060
has officially opened
an investigation

24:57.104 --> 24:59.323
into the McCord campaign.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.977
Good morning.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.434
Not for your legislative agenda.
The Iran scandal's blowing up.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.156
You know, even Nixon

25:06.200 --> 25:08.985
accomplished lots of big
stuff during Watergate.

25:09.029 --> 25:11.161
Title IX, opening China,

25:11.205 --> 25:13.444
creating the EPA.Yeah, but all anyone
remembers is Watergate.

25:13.468 --> 25:14.880
All right, Nixon's not
the best example,

25:14.904 --> 25:16.316
but why am I worried
about your feelings?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.057
I don't know, maybe because
you made me take a job

25:18.081 --> 25:19.494
I didn't want, and now
I'm managing a crisis

25:19.518 --> 25:20.562
I told you not to create,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.564
and if ESI gets
flushed as a result,

25:22.608 --> 25:25.306
every dinner party I attend for
the rest of my natural life,

25:25.349 --> 25:26.588
I'm gonna have to hear theories

25:26.612 --> 25:29.005
about how I should've
saved your presidency

25:29.049 --> 25:31.965
over a scandal that never
should have happened.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.532
Feel better?

25:33.575 --> 25:34.968
Little bit.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.971
Good. Because we are
getting ESI done.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.973
I want you
to make me appointments

25:40.016 --> 25:42.018
with all the undecided
senators. I... No, no, no.

25:42.062 --> 25:45.152
POTUS gives marching orders,
POTUS doesn't march.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.303
When the president shows up
at your door,

25:46.327 --> 25:47.546
that is the nuclear option.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.286
It shouldn't be used lightly.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.288
Okay. How about this idea?

25:51.332 --> 25:53.377
Okay.
I was thinking

25:53.421 --> 25:58.078
about leaning on tech CEOs from
states with wavering senators,

25:58.121 --> 25:59.514
That I like. Yes. that I can...

25:59.558 --> 26:01.168
Madam President, excuse me.Yeah.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.754
This was Senator Miller
five minutes ago.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.519
Now we know
why I lost the election.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.088
Because Elizabeth McCord
colluded with the Iranians

26:08.131 --> 26:10.307
to sabotage my campaign.

26:10.351 --> 26:14.442
Her election is illegitimate
and so is her presidency.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.052
I support my colleague

26:16.096 --> 26:19.055
Chairman Hanson's
righteous investigation

26:19.099 --> 26:21.623
into this grievous matter.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.253
If he were any more
righteously grievous,

26:23.277 --> 26:25.235
his hair would catch fire. DAISY:
This just put

26:25.279 --> 26:26.367
the scandal on steroids.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.934
Look, as long as he's with us

26:27.977 --> 26:30.371
on ESI, Miller can call me
a war criminal.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.547
No distractions.
Let's get to work, okay?

26:48.215 --> 26:50.652
Interesting place to meet.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.262
Well, thought it might be best

26:52.306 --> 26:54.047
to do this privately.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.962
I appreciate that, I guess.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.398
I hear you're considering

26:57.441 --> 26:59.574
joining Miller's ticket.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.663
Considering.
He has not asked.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.449
Miller?

27:05.493 --> 27:08.191
He rode a wave
of nationalist bullpucky,

27:08.235 --> 27:11.020
picking up right
where Callister left off,

27:11.064 --> 27:16.286
with his disgusting attacks
on migrants, the media.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.289
He's not fit

27:19.333 --> 27:20.551
to be president.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.641
He won the nomination. That doesn't mean

27:22.684 --> 27:24.643
that honorable people
should get behind him

27:24.686 --> 27:27.210
and validate his worst impulses.

27:27.254 --> 27:30.039
I get on that ticket,
I can mitigate those impulses.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.042
I can be the adult in the room.
It's my way

27:33.086 --> 27:35.175
of serving. That's the bar?

27:35.218 --> 27:40.006
Serving by keeping
an unfit president in line?

27:41.398 --> 27:43.226
Come on, Carlos.

27:43.270 --> 27:46.708
Wouldn't you rather be on
a ticket you really believe in?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.451
What are you talking about?

27:50.494 --> 27:54.020
I want you to be
my vice president.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.675
You must be joking.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.547
I'm not.

27:59.590 --> 28:02.376
My position on immigration alone
would make it unt...

28:02.419 --> 28:05.161
We worked together
on immigration.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.685
That was
an extreme circumstance.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.990
Land mines.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.340
You discovered
that I have a soft spot in me

28:10.384 --> 28:12.168
when it comes to children. You also broke

28:12.212 --> 28:14.736
with Callister to support
the sanctions on Poland.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.173
No. No.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.349
This would not work.
This is crazy.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.786
Why?

28:20.829 --> 28:23.702
You and I have more in common
than you and Miller.

28:25.573 --> 28:29.620
His politics will divide
this country even further.

28:29.664 --> 28:33.363
But you and I can show America
that people can disagree

28:33.407 --> 28:37.063
and still work together
and get things done.

28:37.106 --> 28:39.065
I'd never give up
being a Republican.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.544
I'd never ask you to.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.199
I wouldn't support
all of your policies.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.636
All I'd ask
is that you hear me out.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.638
And I'd do the same with you.

28:47.682 --> 28:50.380
And when we disagree?

28:50.424 --> 28:51.793
You'll never have
to publicly support

28:51.817 --> 28:53.557
a policy you don't believe in.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.691
As long as you don't
publicly disagree, either.

28:58.911 --> 29:03.219
Look, I-I'm truly honored

29:03.263 --> 29:05.744
for this offer, Elizabeth,

29:05.787 --> 29:08.790
but no matter how you spin this,

29:08.834 --> 29:11.271
I would still be
abandoning my party.

29:13.447 --> 29:16.798
No, I appreciate the courage

29:16.842 --> 29:20.759
that it took you to ask me,
but I'm not that courageous.

29:29.158 --> 29:31.247
Good luck out there.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.119
You, too.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.468
Yeah.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.170
All I ask is that you lean

29:41.214 --> 29:43.390
on Senator Sheehan, Zack.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.134
Okay, thanks for your time.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.570
Who's next?

29:49.613 --> 29:50.808
Ma'am, General Kohl
wants you to know

29:50.832 --> 29:53.313
the countermeasures
against Iran have begun.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.292
Tell him I want a progress
report in an hour.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.535
Yes, ma'am.Sixty.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.624
We got to 60.What? Wait.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.864
How? Son of a bitch Girardi
came around after getting beaten

30:02.888 --> 30:05.281
like a redheaded stepchild
by Kristi Daniels.

30:05.325 --> 30:09.633
Not an hour after you talked to
her, she threatened to pull LCD

30:09.677 --> 30:11.374
and battery production
out of Florida.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.289
Boom!

30:13.333 --> 30:15.161
Mmm.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.641
Doesn't this make you want to
just stay being chief of staff?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.600
Have you no shame,
Madam President?

30:19.643 --> 30:20.906
No.
It's a big deal, Bess.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.579
I know.
Especially with all
the Iran noise.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.823
I know.
Mmm.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.825
Thanks, Mike.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.876
Hey. This is a surprise.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.618
I've got 15 minutes
till my next meeting.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.881
Yeah, I got ten.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.189
I love this jacket.

30:43.232 --> 30:46.453
Oh, well, it's a two-button
basket weave wool,

30:46.496 --> 30:48.237
which is very versatile.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.804
Are you mad at me about Roxanne?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.260
I just thought she had
some neat ideas,

30:51.284 --> 30:54.548
and y-you can always say no.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.550
But you do look good.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.465
How good?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.209
Follow me, FGOTUS.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.254
Yes, ma'am.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.915
Well, I hope that was fun,
because the good times are over.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.153
I was gone, like, ten minutes.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.484
Miller's threatening
to withdraw his support.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.746
That leaves us with 59 votes.

31:18.789 --> 31:20.574
And with that stupid
investigation going on,

31:20.617 --> 31:22.247
the lack of his vote looks like
retribution.Okay. I'll get into it.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.969
No, I'm on it, I'm on it.No.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.598
I have to do this myself. Madam President,
I really wouldn't. I...

31:25.622 --> 31:27.818
I know. I'm supposed to give the
marching orders and not march,

31:27.842 --> 31:29.844
I go that,
and I've been doing it,

31:29.888 --> 31:31.541
but now it is time
for the nuclear option.

31:31.585 --> 31:34.283
I'm not... I don't disagree, it's your
shirt's on inside out.

31:35.676 --> 31:36.895
I'm...

31:36.938 --> 31:38.331
I'll call the motorcade.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.376
Thank you.

31:46.382 --> 31:47.882
Valerie Guillen,
the reporter at The Chronicle

31:47.906 --> 31:49.746
who originally broke
the Senator Miller scandal

31:49.777 --> 31:51.735
is refusing to give up
her source,

31:51.779 --> 31:53.955
but she denies receiving... TAYLOR:
Senator Miller,

31:53.999 --> 31:55.879
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The president just...

31:55.914 --> 31:56.958
Senator.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.569
Got a minute? Oh.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.267
Madam President. Of course.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.350
Ever since President McCord's
press conference...

32:03.747 --> 32:05.967
Four TVs. Thorough.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.796
I like to stay on top
of current events.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.799
Yeah.
Ma'am,

32:11.842 --> 32:14.410
would it be wrong to tell you
how ravishing you look?

32:14.454 --> 32:16.673
You mean because
I'm your president,

32:16.717 --> 32:18.066
or because it's creepy?

32:18.110 --> 32:20.503
Well, I just want
to get a good look at you

32:20.547 --> 32:23.419
because the Oval Office
ages you,

32:23.463 --> 32:26.988
especially with that
whole Iran business.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.077
You won't look the same
come next year.

32:29.121 --> 32:30.687
I got to give you credit.

32:30.731 --> 32:34.430
You are just as vulgar
in private as you are in public.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.955
Why are you here, ma'am?

32:36.998 --> 32:39.609
I need your vote on ESI.

32:39.653 --> 32:41.524
There are 40 other senators

32:41.568 --> 32:43.744
that you could be begging
to flip their vote,

32:43.787 --> 32:45.398
and you chose me?

32:45.441 --> 32:47.617
Those 40 others are opposed
for ideological reasons.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.619
You supported the bill
up until an hour ago.

32:49.663 --> 32:54.450
And you expect me
to be your white knight

32:54.494 --> 32:57.062
when your administration's
under a cloud.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.716
You must be pretty
desperate, ma'am.

32:59.760 --> 33:03.416
Prostrating yourself
instead of dispatching

33:03.459 --> 33:05.331
your little pit bull, Barnow,

33:05.374 --> 33:08.334
like you did to get
the Iran deal done.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.771
Losing hurts, doesn't it?

33:10.814 --> 33:12.903
You accused me
of collusion with Iran.

33:12.947 --> 33:16.385
I wanted to tell you
face-to-face, that's not true.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.475
Well, forgive me
if I'd rather wait

33:19.519 --> 33:21.042
for the results
of the investigation.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.653
I know you've been
cozy with Iran

33:23.697 --> 33:25.133
for years.

33:25.177 --> 33:28.006
Sometimes I wonder
just how cozy you got

33:28.049 --> 33:29.920
with Minister Javani.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.619
God, how low can you go?

33:32.662 --> 33:35.883
The lies you've been spewing
about that deal these past years

33:35.926 --> 33:38.059
have done nothing
for American security...

33:38.103 --> 33:39.669
I resent that, Madam. Too bad.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.107
Get your facts straight.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.500
Now, I'm not here
to relitigate that deal.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.067
What do you want?

33:46.111 --> 33:48.026
My reputation back!

33:49.984 --> 33:51.855
Committee assignments.

33:51.899 --> 33:54.119
That's up to your party.

33:54.162 --> 33:57.818
I want to be right by your
side for the bill signing,

33:57.861 --> 33:59.515
and I want to be
the first person

33:59.559 --> 34:00.710
whose hand you shake and thank,

34:00.734 --> 34:03.389
and then I want you
to personally

34:03.432 --> 34:05.695
lobby Ramirez and Hopkins

34:05.739 --> 34:07.871
to restore my
committee assignments.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.399
Well done, Madam President.

34:13.442 --> 34:14.878
That's how
the sausage gets made.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.620
Enough to make me want
to go full-on vegan.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.708
You got it done.
Next order of business,

34:19.753 --> 34:22.103
updated shortlist of the
new chief of staff options.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.714
Who do you like?

34:24.757 --> 34:26.976
I like this.

34:27.021 --> 34:30.416
I-I don't want
to break in anyone new.

34:30.458 --> 34:32.418
Tell that to Jay.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.942
You got to let that go.
If you will let me go.

34:43.472 --> 34:46.996
Ever since Gordon died,
I've been reevaluating things.

34:47.041 --> 34:51.654
He was the only totally pure
and honest part of my life,

34:51.697 --> 34:53.482
which, being in D.C.,
isn't saying much,

34:53.525 --> 34:55.092
but still.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.443
I just accepted him
for who he was.

34:57.486 --> 35:00.010
If he... if he took a crap
on my bath mat

35:00.054 --> 35:02.839
or tried to hump
the golden across the street,

35:02.883 --> 35:06.016
I just, I always knew
he was being true to himself,

35:06.060 --> 35:08.062
in the moment.

35:11.544 --> 35:14.634
It was his most
profound gift to me.

35:17.637 --> 35:20.161
A lesson in how to live,

35:20.205 --> 35:22.642
and I'm-I'm trying
to honor that.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.559
Look, I would...

35:26.602 --> 35:28.778
I would stand in front
of a bullet train for you, Bess,

35:28.822 --> 35:31.172
which I can now

35:31.216 --> 35:34.958
with the infrastructure part
of the ESI bill,

35:35.002 --> 35:37.918
but I have to trust my gut
on this.

35:41.008 --> 35:44.011
Okay, I'll stop begging.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.056
Thank you.

35:50.235 --> 35:53.803
Aren't you gonna
miss this office?

35:53.847 --> 35:55.283
Oh, I'm not giving this up.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.677
The new guy can get another one.
I was here first.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.507
What?

36:01.550 --> 36:04.988
You just made me realize
who I want to replace you.

36:21.831 --> 36:25.052
Congrats on your first victory
with the ESI bill.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.664
You get two more, tops,

36:28.708 --> 36:30.971
and that's if this
Iran investigation

36:31.014 --> 36:32.581
doesn't cripple you.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.540
It's good to see you, too,
Russell.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.542
Lawn looks nice.

36:36.585 --> 36:40.023
Yeah. Carol fired
the gardener

36:40.067 --> 36:42.243
so I'd have something
relaxing to do.

36:42.287 --> 36:46.029
It's supposed to be Zen
or something.

36:46.073 --> 36:48.597
Nobody tells you about weeds.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.599
Do you realize what a
pain in the ass they are?

36:50.643 --> 36:53.298
They never stop.
They're like lobbyists.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.778
Well, then, I'll get
right to the point.

36:55.822 --> 36:58.738
I'm sorry to drop in unannounced

36:58.781 --> 37:01.044
but I knew
that if I gave you a heads-up

37:01.088 --> 37:03.917
then Carol would
run interference.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.875
Oh.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.704
You want me
to do something... stressful.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.706
Just temporarily.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.927
I want you to step in
as my chief of staff

37:13.970 --> 37:15.929
for a transition period.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.323
I know you've already
given eight years

37:18.366 --> 37:21.761
of this job to Dalton,
and you may be over it,

37:21.804 --> 37:25.112
but this moment
in time is going to determine

37:25.155 --> 37:27.680
how effective
I am going forward,

37:27.723 --> 37:29.769
and...

37:29.812 --> 37:31.771
I really need you.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.730
Don't answer,
because I-I... I know you got

37:34.774 --> 37:39.126
to talk it over with Carol,
and if it's "no," I understand.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.608
I had to ask.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.709
Carol?!

37:56.752 --> 37:58.754
Call the gardener!

38:00.756 --> 38:02.715
I also need to thank

38:02.758 --> 38:04.847
Senator Beauregard Miller

38:04.891 --> 38:08.329
whose decisive vote
made this day possible.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.070
Senator,

38:10.113 --> 38:12.725
your bold leadership

38:12.768 --> 38:14.727
on this historic bill

38:14.770 --> 38:16.729
will always be remembered.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.774
Thank you,
and thank you to everyone

38:18.818 --> 38:21.124
who came together
to get this done.

38:45.192 --> 38:48.326
And that right there is how you
do the first 100 days in office.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.433
Congratulations,
Madam President.

38:49.457 --> 38:50.893
It's a momentous victory.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.436
Well, I couldn't have done it
without the both of you.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.202
Well, that's true. Especially you,
FGOTUS.

38:55.245 --> 38:57.335
It's been a pleasure
making history with you.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.338
Okay.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.774
Enjoy it while it lasts,

39:01.817 --> 39:05.168
'cause this Iran debacle
is gonna be a nightmare.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.301
They are gonna
pull out all the stops,

39:07.345 --> 39:10.435
milk every bit
of lifeblood out of it.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.088
Drink, Russell?

39:12.132 --> 39:14.134
Just a small one.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.355
Well, I want to taste it.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.359
Thank you.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.927
Unto the breach.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.364
Oh.
Hear, hear.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
Oh, I'm taking my office back.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.151
What?

39:32.195 --> 39:33.849
I was here first.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.418
The American Experiment

39:37.462 --> 39:39.725
is about giving everyone
a way forward

39:39.768 --> 39:41.291
even when we disagree.

39:41.335 --> 39:46.035
In fact, disagreement is
the hallmark of our democracy.

39:46.079 --> 39:49.212
We respect our Constitution

39:49.256 --> 39:52.259
by respecting
our fellow citizens,

39:52.302 --> 39:55.044
even when
we don't get everything we want,

39:55.088 --> 39:57.917
even when we disagree
passionately.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.267
Thatis democracy.

40:03.923 --> 40:06.012
Now one of my opponents,

40:06.055 --> 40:09.058
he hasn't liked what he's been
reading about himself lately,

40:09.102 --> 40:11.974
so he's lashed out
at the media in ways

40:12.018 --> 40:15.500
that I believe undermine
freedom of the press,

40:15.543 --> 40:19.852
which is enshrined
in our Constitution.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.509
And he has engaged in attacks...

40:24.552 --> 40:28.774
Personal attacks...
Against his opponents

40:28.817 --> 40:32.430
that are not only irrelevant
to important policy debates,

40:32.473 --> 40:34.910
but are meaningless distractions

40:34.954 --> 40:39.132
that are beneath the dignity
of the office we seek.

40:41.177 --> 40:44.572
Anyone running for public office

40:44.616 --> 40:46.531
who tries to bully his opponents

40:46.574 --> 40:49.055
is not just disrespecting them,

40:49.098 --> 40:51.536
but disrespecting America

40:51.579 --> 40:55.278
and the rights
and values that we stand for.

40:57.324 --> 41:00.501
Anyone who questions
our basic freedoms

41:00.545 --> 41:03.112
because they don't like
what's coming out

41:03.156 --> 41:04.897
about themselves in the press

41:04.940 --> 41:08.030
isn't just disrespecting
our Constitution.

41:08.074 --> 41:10.119
He is rejecting it.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.950
Eroding our core values
and rights

41:14.994 --> 41:18.345
will lead us down a dark road
toward autocracy.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.480
Democracy means
that we stand united,

41:22.523 --> 41:25.918
even when we sit
on different sides of the aisle.

41:25.961 --> 41:28.486
We fight for what we believe in,

41:28.529 --> 41:30.575
but we fight fair.

41:30.618 --> 41:34.535
With decency and dignity
and respect.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.625
Now I realize...

41:37.669 --> 41:40.149
I realize
that these are just words.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.848
So how can I put these words
into action?

41:42.891 --> 41:44.545
How?!

41:44.589 --> 41:47.156
Well, I'd like

41:47.200 --> 41:49.376
to introduce you
to my running mate.

41:49.419 --> 41:52.988
I am humbled and honored
that he decided to join me,

41:53.032 --> 41:55.164
especially
because he and I have been known

41:55.208 --> 41:57.471
to be political rivals.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.300
Well, we fought
for what we believe in,

42:00.343 --> 42:02.650
and we fought
through our differences,

42:02.694 --> 42:05.348
and we got things done.

42:07.263 --> 42:09.222
And we will continue

42:09.265 --> 42:11.050
to rise above our differences

42:11.093 --> 42:13.400
on behalf of all Americans.

42:13.443 --> 42:15.533
I am so proud

42:15.576 --> 42:19.537
to introduce the next vice
president of the United States,

42:19.580 --> 42:22.365
Senator Carlos Morejon.

42:22.409 --> 42:25.630
â™ª Who can I believe in?

42:25.673 --> 42:29.242
â™ª I'm kneeling on the floor

42:29.285 --> 42:31.636
â™ª There has to be a force

42:31.679 --> 42:34.943
â™ª Who do I phone?

42:35.727 --> 42:38.947
â™ª The stars are out
and shining â™ª

42:38.991 --> 42:42.255
â™ª But all I really want
to know â™ª

42:42.298 --> 42:46.041
â™ª Oh, won't you

42:46.085 --> 42:47.956
â™ª Show me the way

42:48.000 --> 42:50.219
â™ª Every day

42:50.263 --> 42:52.221
â™ª I want you...
