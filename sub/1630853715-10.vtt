WEBVTT

00:00.745 --> 00:02.047
Baby Colin is miserable,

00:02.081 --> 00:03.416
and it's a mystery to me.

00:03.450 --> 00:05.688
(heavy metal playing
through headphones)

00:05.722 --> 00:09.195
Seems like only yesterday
when he danced and sang and was

00:09.228 --> 00:10.698
full of joys and smiles.

00:10.732 --> 00:12.167
(singer screaming)

00:12.201 --> 00:13.704
Now he barely talks to me.

00:13.738 --> 00:15.374
And when he does,
it's very unpleasant.

00:15.407 --> 00:18.146
Shit. Have you got enough toys
on the floor?

00:18.179 --> 00:20.217
I say, can you take
the headphones off?

00:20.250 --> 00:21.520
My headphones are on.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.156
Yeah, I know.
Can you take them off?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.058
Just for one second.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.562
(sighs)
Hold on. What?

00:25.595 --> 00:28.668
I was thinking, why don't we hop
the fence at the zoo

00:28.701 --> 00:30.805
and see if those baby rhinos
have grown

00:30.838 --> 00:33.143
-since the last time we...
-Yeah, I'm kind of busy
right now.

00:33.176 --> 00:34.078
...looked at them.

00:34.111 --> 00:36.216
Thank you.

00:36.249 --> 00:37.084
Why are you still here?

00:37.117 --> 00:38.788
-Okay. Uh...
-Huh?

00:38.821 --> 00:41.059
LASZLO:
I know he has
the body of a man now,

00:41.092 --> 00:44.733
but it was literally last week
when he was but a small boy.

00:44.766 --> 00:46.604
And I've read
all the relevant literature

00:46.637 --> 00:49.208
on the trials and tribulations
of being a young person,

00:49.242 --> 00:51.513
but it's provided me
with no guidance at all.

00:51.547 --> 00:55.254
He doesn't even enjoy
his playdates anymore.

00:55.287 --> 00:58.159
-He's really had quite
the growth spurt, hasn't he?
-(Colin shouts)

00:58.193 --> 01:00.397
Ain't that the truth, Alison?
You see, he's on the cusp

01:00.430 --> 01:01.700
-of that awkward age.
-(giggles)

01:01.734 --> 01:04.105
-(shouts)
-No, I'm on base. I'm on base!

01:04.138 --> 01:06.276
(crying):
Dylan!

01:06.309 --> 01:08.113
Dylan said that the staircase

01:08.146 --> 01:11.720
was base, and I was touching
base, but he hit me anyway!

01:11.754 --> 01:14.225
-(crying): It wasn't fair!
-It's all right.

01:14.258 --> 01:15.862
I wish you were dead, Dylan!

01:15.895 --> 01:17.799
-LASZLO: No, no, come on.
No, you don't.
-Yes, I do!

01:17.832 --> 01:19.536
GUILLERMO:
It's like he's half kid,
half adult.

01:19.569 --> 01:20.738
It's okay.

01:20.772 --> 01:22.408
I mean,
he looks like Colin Robinson

01:22.441 --> 01:23.744
and he sounds like
Colin Robinson, but mentally

01:23.778 --> 01:26.115
-he's all over the place.
-So, you're gonna hold the bat.

01:26.149 --> 01:28.854
-Why?
-As the other parental figure
in his life,

01:28.888 --> 01:31.259
I thought I'd have the
opportunity to teach him things.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.562
Swing! All right!

01:32.596 --> 01:34.332
-Okay. It's okay. I'll get it.
-It just happened so fast.

01:34.365 --> 01:35.768
(chuckles)
Just...

01:35.802 --> 01:38.173
So you really want
to look at the ball, okay?

01:38.206 --> 01:39.743
-I did look at the ball.
-LASZLO: The only thing
that seems to give him

01:39.776 --> 01:42.181
any joy these days and has done
since he learned to walk

01:42.214 --> 01:43.316
is hammering holes

01:43.350 --> 01:45.187
in his old room in the basement.

01:45.220 --> 01:46.590
Now, I've tried to stop him,

01:46.624 --> 01:48.259
but it seems
like a healthy release

01:48.293 --> 01:50.263
for this seemingly relentless

01:50.297 --> 01:52.434
and unwarranted anger.

He'll grow out of it.

04:43.376 --> 04:44.679
Well, at the rate he's growing,

04:44.713 --> 04:46.415
he should have grown out
of it already.

04:46.449 --> 04:48.821
Well, at least he's not
a boring energy vampire.

04:48.854 --> 04:52.027
I'd rather he was boring
than this insolent monster.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.129
NANDOR:
With respect,

04:53.163 --> 04:55.935
the trouble is that neither
of you know how to speak

04:55.968 --> 04:58.541
to the younger generation
in their own language.

04:58.574 --> 04:59.676
What, and you do? (chuckles)

04:59.709 --> 05:01.479
Some of my finest soldiers

05:01.513 --> 05:02.715
were just teenagers.

05:02.749 --> 05:04.619
It was essential to communicate

05:04.653 --> 05:06.590
with them in their own lingo--

05:06.623 --> 05:08.527
or gutter patois, if you will--

05:08.561 --> 05:10.932
to inspire and motivate them

05:10.965 --> 05:12.535
onto the battlefield

05:12.569 --> 05:14.806
because we'd usually put
the youngsters at the front.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.409
-(groans)
-And they would instantly

05:16.442 --> 05:18.614
be mowed down
by the attacking army.

05:18.647 --> 05:20.116
So they were always a little

05:20.150 --> 05:21.954
reluctant to stand there.

05:21.987 --> 05:25.026
-(groans)
-You know what? I will fix.

05:26.028 --> 05:27.464
We're fucked.

05:27.499 --> 05:28.968

-(hammering)

05:29.001 --> 05:30.771

05:34.513 --> 05:36.683
Very cool tunes.

05:36.717 --> 05:39.355
I, too, get off on rocking out

05:39.388 --> 05:40.825
to cool tunes like these.

05:40.858 --> 05:43.531
-(music ends)
-But you know,

05:43.564 --> 05:45.433
there's more to life
than just...

05:45.467 --> 05:47.705
(music resumes)

05:50.578 --> 05:52.114
-Dude.
-But you know,

05:52.147 --> 05:53.684
there's more to life than just

05:53.717 --> 05:55.755
rocking out to cool tunes.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.424
-Like what?
-Ah,

05:57.457 --> 05:59.428
you're probably
too young to grok

05:59.461 --> 06:01.633
what I'm trying to lay down.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.537
One of the all-time

06:03.571 --> 06:06.777
coolest ways of rocking out
is to be nice and polite

06:06.810 --> 06:10.083
to your housemates
and to your elders.

06:10.116 --> 06:11.920
Wow. R-Really?

06:11.954 --> 06:14.526
A-A-And you think
this could work for me?

06:14.559 --> 06:16.997
I... I do.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.433
Thanks, man.

06:18.466 --> 06:20.638
Uh, thank you for blessing me

06:20.671 --> 06:22.542
with these pearls of wisdom.

06:22.575 --> 06:25.113
You are very welcome...

06:25.146 --> 06:26.449
man. (chuckles)

06:26.482 --> 06:27.986
You see?

06:28.019 --> 06:31.359
You just have to know
how to speak their language.

06:36.435 --> 06:37.872
If anyone complains,
that's when you can kill them.

06:37.906 --> 06:40.076
And I was wondering...
Oh-oh, Mistress Nadja.

06:40.110 --> 06:42.180
-Oh. (chuckles)
-May I introduce to you

06:42.214 --> 06:44.418
to Mr. Phineas Taylor Barnum?

06:44.451 --> 06:45.721
-Hmm.
-Oh.

06:45.755 --> 06:47.424
Mr. Barnum was just
giving me some great advice

06:47.457 --> 06:49.461
-about bringing in the crowds.
-Mm-hmm.

06:49.496 --> 06:52.535
Mr. Barnum. Please, do give us
just one moment. (chuckles)

06:52.568 --> 06:54.506
Okay, thank you. (chuckles)

06:54.539 --> 06:57.612
P.T. Barnum died
over 150 years ago.

06:57.645 --> 06:59.849
-Is he a vampire?
-Yeah, don't ask me to explain.

06:59.883 --> 07:01.620
Well, I feel like I must
ask you to explain.

07:01.653 --> 07:03.657
-Ah, it's no big deal.
-Well, I'm your boss,

07:03.691 --> 07:04.993
so do you want me
to use my loud voice?

07:05.026 --> 07:06.763
-Hi, guys.
-Oh, for...
-Oh, hi.

07:06.797 --> 07:10.036
Uh, hey, uh, sorry,
I-I feel like I'm interrupting.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.540
-You are.
-Oh.

07:11.573 --> 07:12.775
I just wanted to give you

07:12.809 --> 07:14.879
this CD of some songs that I

07:14.913 --> 07:18.554
burned for you. I mean,
I-I didn't burn it just for you,

07:18.587 --> 07:20.625
'cause that'd be
creepy and pathetic.

07:20.658 --> 07:23.229
Well, I had an extra CD,
I guess, and so...

07:23.262 --> 07:24.499
Thank you, Colin.

07:24.532 --> 07:26.202
I will definitely figure out

07:26.235 --> 07:28.540
how to listen to this.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.776
If you like the songs,

07:29.809 --> 07:32.548
maybe we could
hang out sometime.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.253
And if you don't like the songs,
I don't really give a shit.

07:35.286 --> 07:37.725
So, either way, it's,
you know, whatever.

07:37.759 --> 07:39.963
All right, later. Bye.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.568
-Speak, bitch.
-All right.

07:42.602 --> 07:45.073
But you mustn't breathe
a word of this to anyone.

07:45.106 --> 07:46.743
(both clear throats)

07:46.777 --> 07:49.616
Over the last few decades,
I have come across

07:49.649 --> 07:51.620
some books in the
Vampiric Council library

07:51.653 --> 07:53.957
that contain
the most forbidden-est

07:53.991 --> 07:56.730
of secret knowledges,
and I have learned

07:56.763 --> 07:59.268
the ancient art form
of summoning the dead.

07:59.301 --> 08:00.604
(gasps)

08:00.638 --> 08:03.142
-But this is witchcraft.
-(groans)

08:03.176 --> 08:04.646
Cut that out.

08:04.679 --> 08:07.150
So you can bring any person
back from the dead?

08:07.184 --> 08:09.522
Only the ones that I own
the souls of.

08:09.556 --> 08:10.825
One moment.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.895
Mr. Barnum,
right this way, please.

08:14.632 --> 08:16.570
May I present...

08:16.603 --> 08:18.507
the second finest collection

08:18.540 --> 08:21.212
of human dead souls
in these United States.

08:21.245 --> 08:22.682
NADJA:
Wow.

08:22.715 --> 08:23.917
And who has
the finest collection?

08:23.951 --> 08:25.888
(sighs) Some rich computer guy.

08:25.921 --> 08:29.629
So, um, how do you turn
these souls back into people?

08:29.662 --> 08:31.733
(chuckles) Now, sadly,

08:31.767 --> 08:34.672
once the souls are reanimated
into human form,

08:34.706 --> 08:36.710
they only live
for about 24 hours

08:36.743 --> 08:38.279
and then they dissolve back

08:38.312 --> 08:40.651
into the ingredients
from whence they came.

08:40.684 --> 08:42.287
-Oh. Ooh.
-Okay, hand me the soul.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.761
Okay. Thank you. And in it goes.

08:47.330 --> 08:48.634
Oh, it stinks.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.638
That's life, baby.
Take it in. (sniffs)

08:50.671 --> 08:51.540
MAN:
Hello?

08:51.573 --> 08:53.677
-(gasps)
-(Guide squeals)

08:53.711 --> 08:57.150
-(laughing)
-Ah!

08:57.184 --> 08:58.086
It worked.

08:58.119 --> 09:00.123
-Scott Joplin, I presume?
-(Scott chuckles)

09:00.156 --> 09:02.294
Happy to make your acquaintance,
madam. (chuckles)

09:02.327 --> 09:04.566
-And yours.
-Uh, and you as well, madam.
-(chuckles)

09:04.599 --> 09:07.204
SEAN:
Look, uh, we all make mistakes.

09:07.237 --> 09:08.574
It's no big deal.

09:08.607 --> 09:09.809
Well, it kind of is
a big deal, Sean,

09:09.843 --> 09:11.112
'cause he stole your car.

09:11.145 --> 09:12.749
(mumbles):
I was gonna bring it back.

09:12.782 --> 09:13.584
I beg your pardon?

09:13.617 --> 09:15.821
I said I was going
to bring it back.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.658
SEAN:
Listen, he was just taking it

09:17.692 --> 09:18.794
for a little joyride.

09:18.827 --> 09:20.063
Colin, maybe you could help us

09:20.096 --> 09:21.566
understand
what you were thinking.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.236
-I don't know.
-LASZLO: Your behavior

09:23.269 --> 09:25.140
is nothing like
the Colin we know.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.945
The Colin you know?
You don't know me at all.

09:27.979 --> 09:31.152
I mean, you can't tell me
who my parents are

09:31.185 --> 09:32.855
or where I came from

09:32.889 --> 09:35.260
or why I have these
thoughts in my head

09:35.293 --> 09:36.930
about hammering holes

09:36.963 --> 09:39.001
-in the wall.
-We don't know ourselves!

09:39.034 --> 09:40.871
COLIN:
You can't tell me why I grew

09:40.905 --> 09:43.911
a foot and a half overnight
like a human radish.

09:43.944 --> 09:45.781
Listen, you ungrateful fuck,
you're giving me the pip.

09:45.815 --> 09:47.217
-SEAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-We're doing our best here.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.987
Oh, well, that makes me feel
so much better.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.290
SEAN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, guys, guys.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.358
LASZLO:
All right, you cheeky fuck.

09:51.392 --> 09:52.360
Things are getting

09:52.394 --> 09:53.664
a little too heated in here.

09:53.697 --> 09:54.866
Yeah, 'cause he
fucking started it.

09:54.899 --> 09:55.868
-He started it.
-Okay, listen,

09:55.901 --> 09:57.337
my dad and I used to fight

09:57.370 --> 09:58.674
like this all the time!

09:58.707 --> 10:00.678
And nothing good came from it!

10:00.711 --> 10:02.882
-You understand me?
-Yes.

10:02.915 --> 10:04.686
-Okay.
-SEAN: But my pops and I,

10:04.719 --> 10:07.357
we were able to figure out a way
to settle our differences.

10:07.390 --> 10:10.698
And that's what we're gonna do
right now. So, get up.

10:10.731 --> 10:11.766
-What?
-Get up.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.102
Both of youse.

10:13.136 --> 10:15.406
Let's do it.
You can trust Seanie.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.776
All right, face each other.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.814
-We are.
-Good. Make eye contact.

10:18.847 --> 10:21.753
Okay? Good enough.

10:21.786 --> 10:22.922
Now, I'm gonna
count down from three.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.661
When I say go, start swinging.

10:25.694 --> 10:27.164
-Wait, what?
-First one to tap out,

10:27.197 --> 10:28.867
other one's
head of the household.

10:28.901 --> 10:30.704
-Three, two, one...
-No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

10:30.738 --> 10:32.809
-We're not doing that.
-Come on!

10:32.842 --> 10:35.748
Wait, it-it's-it's all right.
I feel better now.

10:35.781 --> 10:37.685
I'm sorry
that I disappointed you.

10:37.718 --> 10:39.656
Mm.

10:39.689 --> 10:40.958
There's got to be a "but."

10:40.991 --> 10:43.864
No, no "buts."
Mr. Rinaldi, maybe we can

10:43.897 --> 10:45.868
go find a tow truck and get your

10:45.901 --> 10:47.839
-car out of Richmond Creek.
-SEAN: Good man.

10:47.872 --> 10:50.811
Come on. I mean,
I'd rather take the insurance,

10:50.845 --> 10:51.880
but...

10:53.817 --> 10:55.253
He's a lot calmer
and more pleasant

10:55.286 --> 10:56.388
when he's made me angry.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.259
-(door opens)
-He's feeding on us.

10:58.292 --> 10:59.896
-But not by boring us...
-(door closes)

10:59.929 --> 11:02.000
...but by infuriating us.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.904
-I think you might be right.
-Colin Robinson

11:03.937 --> 11:06.676
is and will always be

11:06.710 --> 11:08.179
-an energy vampire.
-Yeah.

11:08.212 --> 11:10.083
Which means I have to tell him.

11:10.116 --> 11:13.690
I have to tell him
exactly what he is.

11:14.258 --> 11:17.430
Why didn't you tell me
about this secret wisdom

11:17.464 --> 11:19.836
and this collection of souls?
I can't believe it.

11:19.869 --> 11:21.706
Well, you don't seem
very interested

11:21.740 --> 11:23.810
when I try to share things
about my life.

11:23.844 --> 11:25.446
-(groans)
-Hey, what about asking

11:25.480 --> 11:28.319
Diamond Jim Brady for some tips
about the crowds, huh?

11:28.352 --> 11:31.760
He was a noted gourmand
and nightlife habitué.

11:31.793 --> 11:32.795
NADJA:
No.

11:32.828 --> 11:34.933
The reanimated humans themselves

11:34.966 --> 11:36.235
will be the show.

11:36.268 --> 11:38.306
Imagine the crowds we will get.

11:38.339 --> 11:41.278
The greatest minds
in all of human history

11:41.312 --> 11:44.084
together onstage
for one night only

11:44.117 --> 11:45.955
-at Nadja's.
-Wow.

11:45.988 --> 11:48.727
I really should have
thought of that.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.898
Yeah. It's actually
very troubling that you didn't.

11:50.931 --> 11:53.269
Ah! (chuckles)

11:58.379 --> 12:00.416
(speaking Russian)

12:01.385 --> 12:04.726
So, it's not going so well.
I told Nadja

12:04.759 --> 12:07.163
she might want to do some
homework before the panel,

12:07.197 --> 12:09.502
but she said she just
wanted to wing it.

12:09.535 --> 12:11.071
(continues speaking Russian)

12:13.877 --> 12:15.915
(laughs)

12:15.948 --> 12:19.054
Wow. Food for thought,
Mr. Tchaikovsky.

12:19.087 --> 12:21.960
Food for bloody thought.
(chuckles) Now, um,

12:21.993 --> 12:23.797
Lady Murasaki Shikibu,

12:23.830 --> 12:26.468
some say your Tales of Genji

12:26.503 --> 12:29.909
created the literary form
we now call the novel.

12:29.943 --> 12:32.213
So, I must ask you,

12:32.247 --> 12:34.852
where do you get
your ideas from?

12:34.886 --> 12:37.424
(speaking Japanese)

12:39.929 --> 12:41.499
NADJA:
Uh, Mr. Da Vinci, if you want

12:41.533 --> 12:43.169
to jump in anytime,
just feel like a normal

12:43.202 --> 12:45.541
conversation, where we all
cut in each other and...

12:45.574 --> 12:47.344
(speaks Italian)

12:48.880 --> 12:50.350
Too true.

12:50.383 --> 12:52.454
-COLIN: An energy vampire?
-LASZLO: Yeah.

12:52.487 --> 12:54.926
And so there's...

12:54.959 --> 12:58.065
like, nothing I can do
to-to change it?

12:58.099 --> 13:00.169
No. I'm afraid not, my boy.

13:00.203 --> 13:02.140
You see, it's genetics.
It's beyond our control.

13:02.173 --> 13:04.011
If I'd have been told
when I was your age

13:04.044 --> 13:06.048
that I'd be burdened
with rugged good looks,

13:06.081 --> 13:08.352
a rapier wit, and a thick cock,

13:08.386 --> 13:11.860
I, too, would have protested,
but, uh, them's the breaks.

13:11.893 --> 13:14.499
Just... an energy vampire,

13:14.532 --> 13:16.435
it just, it sounds so awful.

13:16.468 --> 13:18.205
Yeah, it's not great.

13:19.474 --> 13:22.013
Well, why didn't you
do something?

13:22.047 --> 13:24.084
You should have ought
to done something about it

13:24.117 --> 13:25.521
instead of just sitting here.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.593
You know the saying,
"Man makes plans and...

13:28.627 --> 13:30.430
hmm, laughs."

13:30.463 --> 13:31.265
Who, God?

13:31.298 --> 13:33.202
-(groaning)
-Now you're blaming God?

13:33.235 --> 13:35.373
Who next, Baby Jesus?!

13:35.406 --> 13:38.012
-(groans loudly)
-I hate you!

13:38.045 --> 13:40.283
Shit, that's painful.

13:40.316 --> 13:43.322
GUILLERMO:
I'm doing fine, I guess.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.859
You know, with
Nandor's wife Marwa gone

13:44.892 --> 13:46.596
and Colin basically
all grown up,

13:46.629 --> 13:49.267
I feel like there's not much
for me to do around here.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.842
So, I guess this is what
it feels like

13:52.875 --> 13:54.311
to be an empty nester.

13:54.344 --> 13:56.549
I never thought
I'd get bored of this job

13:56.583 --> 13:57.685
'cause there's always

13:57.718 --> 14:00.356
something to do,
but nothing ever changes,

14:00.390 --> 14:02.027
even in my personal life.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.262
I found my first boyfriend,
and he...

14:03.295 --> 14:05.299
left me for himself.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.573
It's back to where it all
started and the same

14:08.607 --> 14:10.176
day in, day out.

14:10.209 --> 14:12.180
It's like hamsters
in those wheels.

14:12.213 --> 14:13.917
I'm a hamster in a...

14:13.950 --> 14:16.956
(sighs)
wheel.

14:25.139 --> 14:28.212
Knock, knock.
Seeing if you need anything.

14:28.245 --> 14:30.984
No. All good. Thanks.

14:31.018 --> 14:32.053
You're kind of quiet lately.

14:32.087 --> 14:34.992
Are you sad
because Marwa's gone?

14:35.026 --> 14:37.230
There's nothing like
the end of a relationship

14:37.263 --> 14:40.036
to really make one
appreciate being alone.

14:40.069 --> 14:41.573
(scoffs) So that's it?

14:41.606 --> 14:43.510
-That is what?
-It was so important

14:43.543 --> 14:44.946
for you to find a wife

14:44.979 --> 14:45.948
and have a huge wedding,

14:45.981 --> 14:49.054
and now that's all gone,
and you're just fine?

14:49.087 --> 14:50.490
Pretty much, yeah.

14:50.524 --> 14:53.563
Don't you feel like nothing
ever changes around here?

14:53.597 --> 14:56.068
Like, every day
just leads to the next

14:56.101 --> 14:57.538
and then the next,
and before you know it,

14:57.571 --> 15:00.076
years go by?

15:00.109 --> 15:03.048
Yes. Isn't it wonderful?

15:03.082 --> 15:04.317
Okay.

15:05.721 --> 15:07.123
So then what's next?

15:07.157 --> 15:08.493
As you may have noticed,

15:08.527 --> 15:11.098
I've really got back
into reading books,

15:11.131 --> 15:12.167
so I think

15:12.200 --> 15:14.271
I'm just gonna do this
for a while.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.974
-Oh, for how long?
-Not long.

15:16.008 --> 15:18.279
15 years, maybe 20.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.293
(sighs)

15:26.663 --> 15:29.000
(sniffles)

15:29.034 --> 15:31.238
(heavy metal playing)

15:40.223 --> 15:42.026
As I once said,

15:42.060 --> 15:44.297
you can only win over
the opponent...

15:44.331 --> 15:46.235
We figured out,
we don't need to do these

15:46.268 --> 15:47.738
in front of a live audience.

15:47.771 --> 15:50.276
We can reach a bigger group
of people by simply

15:50.309 --> 15:52.982
recording it and then
broadcasting it electronically.

15:53.015 --> 15:54.585
NADJA:
Hello, and welcome to

15:54.619 --> 15:56.689
Talk History with Nadja
of Antipaxos.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.225
On tonight's episode...

15:58.259 --> 16:01.098
Then we can make money
by selling advertising on it.

16:01.131 --> 16:04.672
Hatred is the
subtlest form of...

16:04.705 --> 16:06.475
If I could just, uh,
quickly interrupt for a moment.

16:06.509 --> 16:08.179
Would you be so kind
as to read off

16:08.212 --> 16:10.149
-this card, Mr. Gandhi?
-Mm.

16:10.183 --> 16:12.588
"Pan-seared steaks

16:12.621 --> 16:14.391
"with hot honey biscuits.

16:14.424 --> 16:17.698
"Cheesy pork chorizo enchiladas.

16:17.731 --> 16:21.004
"And those are just two
of the signature dishes

16:21.038 --> 16:22.240
-coming from..."
-Mmm, mmm.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.177
"...Blue Apron this month."

16:24.211 --> 16:26.649
Yum, yum, yum.
But tell me, Mahatma,

16:26.683 --> 16:28.052
when was the first time

16:28.085 --> 16:29.789
you tried Blue Apron?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.091
(clears throat)

16:31.124 --> 16:32.360
Fuck it. Give it here.
I'll read it.

16:32.393 --> 16:34.064
Oh, no, no, no, sorry,
Mr. Hemingway.

16:34.097 --> 16:35.501
I-I wanted you to do

16:35.534 --> 16:37.505
the Casper mattresses one
before the next break.

16:42.648 --> 16:44.484
NADJA:
So, the money
from our sponsorships

16:44.519 --> 16:47.156
was dependent on total
listeners. We made Guillermo

16:47.190 --> 16:50.429
listen 11 times
and made 0.6 cents.

16:50.463 --> 16:51.131
(groans)

16:51.164 --> 16:54.104
All that witchcraft for nothing.

16:54.137 --> 16:56.074
Turns out the world
just isn't ready

16:56.108 --> 16:58.112
for electronic audio stories.

16:58.145 --> 16:59.381
It also has no use

16:59.414 --> 17:01.084
for a vampire nightclub.

17:01.118 --> 17:02.086
(sighs)

17:02.120 --> 17:03.523
Enough is enough.

17:03.557 --> 17:05.359
I told The Guide to go
and sleep at my house

17:05.393 --> 17:07.330
for a girls night,
and she obviously

17:07.363 --> 17:09.769
jumped far too enthusiastically
at that chance.

17:09.802 --> 17:12.040
Ciao. Au revoir.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.277
NADJA:
I told the wraiths that
they've been working too hard,

17:14.311 --> 17:15.681
so they should go on vacation.

17:15.714 --> 17:17.651
Send me a postcard.
See you when you're back.

17:17.685 --> 17:20.489
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

17:20.524 --> 17:22.393
(sighs)

17:22.427 --> 17:24.164
You guys should probably
get out of here.

17:24.197 --> 17:26.569
It's over.

17:30.209 --> 17:33.349
I said get out.
Fuck off. (hisses)

17:33.382 --> 17:35.219

17:45.641 --> 17:47.043

20:03.950 --> 20:06.321
This is all my fault.
If I had not accepted

20:06.354 --> 20:08.225
your kind invitation
last night--

20:08.258 --> 20:09.695
-thank you again, by the way...
-Mm-hmm.

20:09.729 --> 20:11.331
...I would have been here,
and I could have

20:11.364 --> 20:12.835
-kept this from happening.
-Listen,

20:12.868 --> 20:15.239
we can't be everywhere
all the time, can we?

20:15.272 --> 20:17.376
No, but we did get lucky.

20:17.410 --> 20:20.449
Nothing actually
got burned. Phew.

20:20.483 --> 20:22.253
Nothing got burned?

20:22.286 --> 20:23.422
The blood sprinklers went off

20:23.455 --> 20:25.259
and extinguished the fire
before it could

20:25.292 --> 20:26.428
really get going.

20:26.461 --> 20:27.831
-The blood sprinklers?
-Yes.

20:27.865 --> 20:30.771
The blood sprinklers
that have never worked

20:30.804 --> 20:33.543
any of the times we have tried
to make them work?

20:33.576 --> 20:37.450
(sighs) This is making me
very hungry.

20:38.787 --> 20:41.391
So, your office

20:41.425 --> 20:42.961
is the only room that got burned

20:42.995 --> 20:44.999
because there are
no blood sprinklers in it.

20:45.032 --> 20:45.901
Yes.

20:45.934 --> 20:49.775
(voice breaking):
I am so upset right now.

20:49.809 --> 20:51.378
(normal voice):
So, I was just wondering, um,

20:51.411 --> 20:52.681
how much money
can we get for this?

20:52.714 --> 20:54.417
Depends what kind
of insurance you have.

20:54.451 --> 20:56.823
What is "insur-suriance,"

20:56.856 --> 20:58.459
and, uh, where can we get some?

20:58.493 --> 21:01.599
Uh, probably a little late
for that at this point.

21:01.632 --> 21:03.035
You said you had a floor plan

21:03.068 --> 21:05.039
-I can take a look at?
-Yes, right this way.

21:05.072 --> 21:06.876
Shit.

21:06.909 --> 21:08.947
(whimpering)

21:11.418 --> 21:14.859
NADJA:
I haven't been making
the best decisions recently,

21:14.892 --> 21:18.867
thanks to all the delicious
liquor blood I've been drinking.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.871
(chuckles)

21:22.541 --> 21:26.314
(crying) My money.

21:26.348 --> 21:30.389
She was so fresh and green,

21:30.422 --> 21:33.863
and now the faces are all burnt!

21:52.400 --> 21:53.468
(sniffles)

22:06.796 --> 22:08.566
GUILLERMO:
No. The way it works

22:08.600 --> 22:10.504
is, you buy the insurance

22:10.537 --> 22:12.406
before something bad happens,

22:12.440 --> 22:13.776
-and then...
-NADJA: No, I think, my friend,

22:13.810 --> 22:15.981
you buy. And did you buy? No.

22:16.014 --> 22:18.385
-(scoffs)
-How much money could we get

22:18.418 --> 22:19.788
if we set him on fire?

22:19.822 --> 22:21.526
-(gasps)
-Hey, hey. What's up?

22:21.559 --> 22:23.061
How's it hanging?

22:23.095 --> 22:24.832
L-O-L. R-O-F-L.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.938
Y-O-L-O. O-M-G. W-T-F.
(chuckles)

22:27.971 --> 22:31.812
All those acronyms,
I love them. (grunts)

22:32.981 --> 22:35.152
Colin Robinson?

22:35.185 --> 22:36.689
Is it really you?

22:36.722 --> 22:38.125
Well, it's not Don Knotts.
(chuckles)

22:38.158 --> 22:40.931
-But how the shit have you...?
-Oh, well,

22:40.964 --> 22:44.738
the great thing about keeping
a detailed diary is,

22:44.772 --> 22:48.145
if you ever forget
anything about your life,

22:48.178 --> 22:51.586
you can look it up.
It's also great

22:51.619 --> 22:54.090
for receipts.
Now, a lot of people

22:54.123 --> 22:56.696
keep receipts,
but they forget to write down

22:56.729 --> 22:58.499
what they were for, which causes

22:58.533 --> 23:00.704
a major headache come tax time.

23:00.737 --> 23:03.509
Whether you hire
an accountant or

23:03.543 --> 23:05.179
you do it online by yourself,

23:05.212 --> 23:06.716
you're gonna miss
some deductions

23:06.749 --> 23:09.153
because you won't
be able to reference

23:09.187 --> 23:11.592
what they were
when Johnny Taxman

23:11.626 --> 23:13.161
-comes and...
-Colin Robinson,
tell me something,

23:13.195 --> 23:16.434
a while ago, we went to
a lads night at Sean's house,

23:16.468 --> 23:18.506
and as we entered his premises,

23:18.539 --> 23:20.142
you used some ridiculous
childish voice.

23:20.175 --> 23:22.848
Meesa Jar Jar Binks.

23:22.881 --> 23:24.718
-It's him.
-NADJA: Ah. Well,

23:24.752 --> 23:27.724
welcome back, original
Colin Robinson. Now,

23:27.758 --> 23:29.728
how much money do we have
in our bank account?

23:29.762 --> 23:33.870
Uh, around $655,415

23:33.903 --> 23:34.872
and change.

23:34.905 --> 23:36.509
-(squeals)
-Oh, yes, very nice.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.376
COLIN:
Now, I wanted to roll that

23:37.410 --> 23:38.813
into a Roth IRA,
not to be confused...

23:38.846 --> 23:40.082
What's our
bank account PIN code?

23:40.115 --> 23:43.021
Oh, our personal
identification number

23:43.055 --> 23:45.025
is 420, 69, 24, 7.

23:45.059 --> 23:46.662
I'll call the contractors
in the morning.

23:46.696 --> 23:49.935
Actually, if it's to fix up
this shithole,

23:49.969 --> 23:50.637
I'll do it.

23:50.670 --> 23:52.507
If there's anything I enjoy more

23:52.541 --> 23:53.776
than managing a project,

23:53.810 --> 23:55.680
it's micromanaging a project.

23:55.714 --> 23:59.153
And, so, after you
replace these pipes,

23:59.187 --> 24:01.091
-we're gonna want to put in...
-New Sheetrock and...

24:01.124 --> 24:03.028
Excuse me, if I may finish.

24:03.061 --> 24:05.500
We're gonna want
to put on half-inch

24:05.533 --> 24:07.169
VOC-absorbing drywall,

24:07.203 --> 24:10.543
not Sheetrock,
as you mistakenly said.

24:10.577 --> 24:13.115
Uh, Laszlo, what do you want
to do with this race car bed?

24:13.148 --> 24:15.185
Do you want to keep it,
or can we get rid of it?

24:15.219 --> 24:17.256
Well...

24:17.289 --> 24:18.960
that's your bed.

24:18.993 --> 24:20.162
Well, it was.

24:20.195 --> 24:21.932
I-I-I've never seen
this bed in my life.

24:21.966 --> 24:24.070
All right, well,
shitcan the bed.

24:24.103 --> 24:25.507
Now let's head downstairs.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.778
I want to give you guys
a couple quick tips

24:27.811 --> 24:31.184
on how to remove
old Formica tiling.

24:31.217 --> 24:32.219
The asbestos

24:32.253 --> 24:33.690
in the adhesive

24:33.723 --> 24:35.059
-can become quite a...
-Colin?

24:35.092 --> 24:37.129
-Yeah.
-So, you really don't remember

24:37.163 --> 24:39.535
anything from the last year?

24:39.568 --> 24:41.071
Uh, no. Not really.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.676
I-I remember it was
my 100th birthday party,

24:43.710 --> 24:45.245
and I had a bit of,
uh, tummy trouble...

24:45.279 --> 24:47.617
-Right.
-...and the next thing
I remember is,

24:47.651 --> 24:50.255
I'm reading my diaries,
and, yeah,

24:50.289 --> 24:51.424
everything in between's a blank.

24:51.458 --> 24:54.999
You don't remember me bringing
you up from a small baby?

24:55.032 --> 24:57.537
No. No, not at all.

24:57.571 --> 24:59.073
Do you remember, um,

24:59.107 --> 25:01.211
me playing the piano
and you singing and dancing?

25:01.244 --> 25:04.117
And then sometimes we'd jump
over the fence at the zoo

25:04.150 --> 25:06.154
in the middle of the night
to look at the baby rhinos?

25:06.187 --> 25:08.993
Yeah, no.
Doesn't ring a single bell.

25:09.027 --> 25:10.262
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:10.295 --> 25:11.732
-You sure?
-Yeah.

25:11.766 --> 25:13.603
Do-do you smell toast
or anything?

25:13.636 --> 25:15.607
-I'm-I'm good.
-All right.

25:16.876 --> 25:20.683
(whistling "Rap Tap on Wood")

25:22.219 --> 25:25.125
(piano playing
"Sunrise, Sunset")

25:32.306 --> 25:34.578
GUILLERMO:
Nothing ever changes
in this house.

25:34.611 --> 25:36.582
Nothing is ever going to change,

25:36.615 --> 25:37.851
unless I change it.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.855
So, that's it for me.

25:39.888 --> 25:42.026
Oh, and you guys can use my room
for storage if you want.

25:42.059 --> 25:43.328
I won't need it.

25:43.361 --> 25:45.567
(sighs)

25:47.637 --> 25:49.006

Yeah, in the back.

25:53.649 --> 25:54.785
Derek.

25:54.818 --> 25:56.287
DEREK:
Yeah, back here.

25:56.321 --> 25:59.661
I just got to finish
this account. 24 times 18.

25:59.695 --> 26:02.166
Okay. What is so urgent?

26:02.199 --> 26:04.337
Well, Derek... (sighs)

26:04.370 --> 26:06.307
this...

26:06.341 --> 26:07.611
is for you.

26:07.644 --> 26:09.648
Whoa. (chuckles)

26:09.681 --> 26:12.621
-What did I do to deserve this?
-Nothing.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.223
It's what you're about to do.

26:14.257 --> 26:15.627
Which is...?

26:15.660 --> 26:18.666
