WEBVTT

00:40.040 --> 00:41.875
Look, I don't understand why we just--

00:52.427 --> 00:53.428
Former OPD?

00:54.096 --> 00:55.389
Then you should know better.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.849
We're sorry. We were concerned.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.517
It's not your job to be concerned.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.938
Now why shouldn't I just charge you both
for interfering in an investigation?

01:03.021 --> 01:06.650
Holt Rollins was inside the house.
Rose Gil too.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.195
That's right. Looks like they'd been there
at least a couple of days.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.406
-Under your noses.
-How'd they all get past you?

01:13.657 --> 01:14.658
Out.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.122
All right, so what now?
You gonna press charges?

01:22.332 --> 01:23.333
Captain.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.545
I got here as fast as I could.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.047
Are you in charge of this case with them?

01:29.548 --> 01:31.717
'Cause they are fucking up
your police work.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.307
You know the reason we're on the house
in the first place is 'cause of her?

01:39.474 --> 01:42.561
But they will not interfere again.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.105
You're out if they do.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.442
Now, you just give me one reason.
That's all I want, Aames.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.027
Just one reason.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.328
Never do that to me again.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.290
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.501
But at least let us tell you what we got.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.503
-Okay.
-This tracks.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.545
Yeah, what's that?
Me getting leads and you fumbling?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.299
No. You being friends with assholes.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.387
Something happened between Holt and Rose.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.847
There was a fight.

02:19.348 --> 02:22.518
She had a prescription for aripiprazole.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.645
Yeah, that's the medication
that was left behind.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.523
We need to find Rose
before somebody else does.

03:37.050 --> 03:42.514
In 1967, California passed
the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act,

03:42.598 --> 03:47.227
named for the two Democrats
and the one Republican who sponsored it.

03:48.020 --> 03:53.859
LPS was the legislation that gutted
our mental health facilities.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.652
Hospitals closed.

03:55.736 --> 04:00.699
Former patients flooded the streets
without the resources to survive.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.119
In 1981, Reagan repealed

04:04.203 --> 04:07.289
President Carter's
Mental Health Systems Act.

04:07.372 --> 04:11.418
Years later, a study done by
a San Francisco advocacy group

04:11.502 --> 04:17.132
reported that 55% of people
experiencing chronic homelessness

04:17.216 --> 04:20.802
have emotional
and psychiatric conditions.

04:20.886 --> 04:25.224
Since then, this state has tried
everything under the sun

04:25.307 --> 04:27.392
to address the homeless problem.

04:27.476 --> 04:32.856
Whether it's because of economics,
domestic violence,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.817
runaway teens or throwaway children,

04:35.901 --> 04:41.323
there has been a steady increase
in the number of the unhoused.

04:41.406 --> 04:46.620
Holt Rollins, Rose Gil and Micah Keith
spent their formative years

04:46.703 --> 04:48.413
living on the streets.

04:48.497 --> 04:52.251
For them,
home wasn't just a physical place.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.961
It was each other.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.589
We know that Rose was in contact
with Joshua for several months

04:57.673 --> 04:59.132
before he was killed.

04:59.216 --> 05:03.470
Could Rose Gil be the missing piece
between Holt

05:04.179 --> 05:06.390
and the murder of Joshua Keith?

05:14.565 --> 05:16.149
Shoot.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.834
Yeah.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.381
Hey, girl. How you doing?

05:39.464 --> 05:42.009
Better, since you've been
looking into things.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.388
Markus, this is Officer Fernando Quezado.
Fernando, Markus Killebrew.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.557
-Hey, how you doing?
-Nando, good to meet you.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.641
Pleasure.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.476
It's good to see you again.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.728
So listen.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.730
I asked around a little bit, okay.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.317
I talked to my daughter and her friends
who also went to school with Drea.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.653
The consensus is that she was a runaway.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.033
They think that because of me.
Because of how I was living.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.660
Hey, hey. That's not necessary, okay?

06:09.328 --> 06:10.412
We're all here to help.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.081
Yeah.
Nando was able to find out a few things.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.416
Right. What you got?

06:14.499 --> 06:17.252
There were a couple of other girls
who went missing around the same time.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.839
-There was a sophomore at McClymonds.
-And a freshman at Castlemont.

06:20.923 --> 06:23.175
All three of them
were in the foster care system.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.430
That's not accidental. That's predatory.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.891
That's something at least, right?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.101
Maybe enough to reopen the search?

06:34.186 --> 06:37.481
Let me just look around a little bit.
I got some business to take care of.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.565
Listen,

06:39.525 --> 06:43.195
I can work with this information.
I'm gonna be in touch soon.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.489
Thanks.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.201
Come on.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.954
Right this way.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.622
Here you go.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.792
-Thank you, baby.
-No worries, no worries.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.213
You know I'm not serving you, right?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.551
Territorial?

07:05.634 --> 07:06.969
A little bit.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.222
Listen.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.642
You did a good thing,
referring this job to me.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.143
I appreciate it.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.855
You're very welcome.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.190
So what is this? Guilt?

07:20.691 --> 07:22.025
Yeah.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.654
All right.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.198
I pride myself
on being a straight shooter.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.784
Texas?

07:30.868 --> 07:31.994
Texas.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.998
Have dinner with me sometime or something.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.084
You know,

07:40.002 --> 07:41.628
I'm not afraid of you.

07:41.712 --> 07:42.754
You should be.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.551
-Good to see you.
-You too.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.387
What was that about?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.598
Trouble. If I do it right.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.017
Since Rose left a message on the tip line,

07:55.100 --> 07:56.560
have you been able to reach her?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.396
No, but I was able to get information
off the pill bottle

07:59.479 --> 08:02.316
prescribed by a psychiatrist
based in Los Angeles.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.859
You think she went all the way back to LA?

08:03.942 --> 08:06.236
No. She wants us to find her.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.198
I'm still trying to figure out
if she refilled the prescription

08:09.281 --> 08:10.657
somewhere in the Bay Area.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.409
I think it's worth a shot.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.578
Hey, Poppy!

08:23.170 --> 08:26.673
Please tell me you are not besmirching
Micah Keith's good name

08:26.757 --> 08:28.800
without ample evidence to back it up.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.052
Is she suing me too?

08:30.135 --> 08:32.513
No, not yet,
but you know there's still time.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.807
Listen to me.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.727
They're looking for any excuse
to add season two's podcast to evidence

08:39.811 --> 08:42.188
to support their claim of harmful intent.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.815
Is that even admissible?

08:46.401 --> 08:48.278
You seem to be under the delusion

08:48.362 --> 08:50.822
that her lawyers are coming to the table
in good faith.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.700
Alana is angry.

08:54.993 --> 08:59.164
I think Ingram was right about giving her
a chance to speak her piece to my face.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.625
Ingram is not your lawyer.
I am your lawyer.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.835
And as your lawyer,

09:02.918 --> 09:05.003
who lives in actual reality
from time to time,

09:05.087 --> 09:07.214
I'm telling you. They want blood.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.424
Then we should cancel the mediation.
Or what's the point?

09:09.508 --> 09:10.509
It's too late.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.386
You gotta show up. Smile.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.055
And try to charm a bunch of snakes
without getting bit.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.473
And in the meantime, please,

09:16.557 --> 09:18.767
watch what you're putting out
on your podcast.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.019
'Cause anything you say can
and will be used against you

09:21.103 --> 09:22.396
in a court of law.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.189
Feel me?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.317
Do you feel me?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.138
It's a really nice custom.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.557
Upright marker and stone.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.685
Slanted. Granite with a photo feature.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.982
And the sunrise on the upper right corner.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.987
-And no dates?
-No dates.

10:13.238 --> 10:18.493
I know it's not logical,
but a date feels so…

10:18.577 --> 10:19.661
Finite.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.788
Finite. Yeah.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.958
Then no dates.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.004
And for your engraving…

10:38.347 --> 10:39.348
Thank you.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.491
You know I love you.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.576
When I'm done with all this,

11:01.203 --> 11:03.080
can we take off, you and me?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.207
Find each other again?

11:06.917 --> 11:08.252
Yes.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.568
Alarm disabled.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.379
I love you with all my heart.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.386
Did anyone see you?

12:42.554 --> 12:45.724
No. I came through the canyons.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.270
I missed you.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.693
Where have you been?

12:58.278 --> 12:59.488
I was with Rose.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.954
She found me.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.915
What happened to her?

13:09.998 --> 13:13.377
-Nothing. I didn't touch her.
-Where is she now?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.462
Gone. I don't know.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.174
God, you two are always upending my life.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.777
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.613
We've been through everything together,
Holt.

13:42.406 --> 13:45.367
I thank God every day
that you found me in People's Park.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.541
I don't know
what I would have done without you.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.378
My great protector.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.507
I had to.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.927
Tough little loudmouth.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.358
I was.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.113
It wasn't always bad when we were kids.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.868
We found each other.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.290
Unless you've been running
the longest con of all time.

14:38.504 --> 14:42.466
My love doesn't lie… okay?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.769
But I worry about Rose.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.854
Can you find her for me?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.689
-Poppy--
-I got an idea.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.692
-It couldn't wait until morning?
-No, no. Listen.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.319
We've been waiting
for Micah to give us answers now.

15:44.403 --> 15:45.404
Pop.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.905
Maybe she already told us.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.616
Why isn't Rose in Discard?

15:50.576 --> 15:52.953
What if she is, and I just missed it?

15:53.036 --> 15:55.205
It might be true, but I'll tell you what,

15:55.289 --> 15:57.207
we can talk about all this shit tomorrow.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.005
Shoot.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.853
-What's your name?
-Lukather Shreveport Scoville.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.397
You'll feel a slight pinch. There we go.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.941
Can you tell me
what day of the week it is?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.026
Thursday.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.487
Heel to toe,
one foot directly in front of the other.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.781
-Any loss of appetite?
-No.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.868
-Dizziness? Disorientation?
-No.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.078
Okay, Mr. Scoville, just follow the light.

16:35.579 --> 16:42.336
Repeat these words back to me:
Table. Giraffe. Truck. Ice cream. Fire.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.924
Table. Giraffe. Ice cre--

16:50.886 --> 16:52.763
Ice cream. Ice cream.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.308
Ice cream.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.771
Damn it.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.984
-I see you ain't playing around, Unc.
-What, you thought I was easy money?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.445
As far as I'm concerned,

17:09.530 --> 17:11.781
a little mental activity's
better for my disease

17:11.865 --> 17:13.367
than those meds they give me.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.998
Don't worry, I'll keep taking the pills
for Lilli and the girls. I'm just saying.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.251
Chances are they ain't nothing
but aspirin.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.880
You ever consider
you might be getting the real stuff?

17:27.464 --> 17:28.632
Ain't no real stuff.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.593
Not yet, and not soon enough.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.806
You know,
when Noble was getting to the end,

17:36.723 --> 17:38.976
he refused to believe
how messy things was getting.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.062
Money was gone. Business was in the red.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.149
If that shit ever happened to me--

17:46.233 --> 17:47.234
It won't.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.659
Shit.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.013
It's nice to have you here, Moss.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.474
Nice to be here, Unc.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.770
Yo, big sir.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.356
Your daughter,
Poppin' and Lockin' is buck wild, man.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.359
She don't listen.
How I'm supposed to represent her in court

18:29.443 --> 18:32.237
if she's not gonna
listen to nothing I say?

18:32.321 --> 18:35.866
If I tell you how to navigate Poppy,
you gonna cut me in on your fees?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.826
Ain't that a bitch?

18:40.287 --> 18:41.413
So what, you a lawyer?

18:42.706 --> 18:44.666
You need to take that surprise
out your voice.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.751
I'm a G.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.379
But yes, I'm also an attorney.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.883
This man here,
he put me through law school.

18:52.966 --> 18:57.513
Boalt. Name changed since I graduated,
racist reckoning or some shit, but…

18:58.096 --> 19:01.266
He used to come in here as a kid,
running his mouth the same way.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.393
Hustling the MC and the customers.

19:03.477 --> 19:07.105
I tried to run him out of here,
but he debated me.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.191
-I won the debate.
-Yes, you did.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.444
Saw how smart he was.
Made sure he used it.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.572
Yeah, I like to say I'm his son.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.492
Number one son,
easier than raising three daughters.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.786
-That's true.
-I got next.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.288
Your shot, kid.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.208
"Kid." I guess he's winning.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.927
All right, hold on. I'll be right back.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.638
Hey. Are you leaving? You just got here.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.640
Hi. Yeah, I'll be back
in time for the reporter.

19:41.723 --> 19:42.808
Is everything okay?

19:42.891 --> 19:46.812
Fine, I'm just-- One of the teenagers
at the youth center got in trouble.

19:46.895 --> 19:50.566
It can't wait? We still need to finalize
the pieces we're including in the auction.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.151
Okay, you have a great eye,
so I trust you.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.321
Micah, Micah. What is going on?

19:58.824 --> 19:59.825
It's Rose.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.913
Okay, this is something
that Markus should be dealing with.

20:04.997 --> 20:09.126
No, this is something
I need to take care of myself or Holt.

20:09.918 --> 20:10.919
Are you--

20:14.548 --> 20:16.425
Are you still in contact with him?

20:17.968 --> 20:19.094
You can't see him.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.180
-Or Rose.
-I cannot wait on Rose.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.473
Poppy's already looking for her.

20:23.557 --> 20:26.685
I don't even want to think
about the damage that she could do.

20:28.437 --> 20:29.479
I understand.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.861
You know what, just let me handle it.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.323
-It's too complicated.
-That's why you should let me do this.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.536
I have no agenda, no baggage,
and I can keep it very simple.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.663
Let you focus on what matters.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.207
Like preparing for your interview.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.334
I'll find Rose before Poppy.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.254
Okay?

21:00.135 --> 21:01.512
Nothing haunts me more than…

21:01.595 --> 21:03.764
The Sapphire Club is the only time

21:03.847 --> 21:07.059
Micah's with an unnamed friend
in all of Discard.

21:07.142 --> 21:10.229
That night, my friend
and I went to the Sapphire Club--

21:10.312 --> 21:12.940
But why would Micah
leave Rose's name out of the book?

21:13.023 --> 21:16.068
Who knows? Maybe something happened.

21:16.568 --> 21:19.029
Maybe they had a falling-out
that she couldn't write about.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.365
And out in these streets, you know,

21:21.990 --> 21:24.618
it's a battle every day, just to survive.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.455
You can't live like that for years
without it messing with your head.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.793
Let me run something by you.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.587
Okay. Shoot.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.550
I met with Charise Spivey at The Knock,

21:39.633 --> 21:43.846
and that cop that Desiree is seeing,
we both agreed--

21:43.929 --> 21:46.265
Wait, what? Desiree is seeing a cop?

21:46.348 --> 21:49.726
Poppy, just put the phone down, all right.
That's not why I'm telling you this.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.603
Just listen, all right.

21:51.687 --> 21:54.731
We both agreed that there could be
a connection with these missing girls.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.943
They were all in the foster care system.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.737
That would make it easier to prey on.

22:00.821 --> 22:03.073
Exactly. So it got me to thinking,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.826
who was Micah before you met her?

22:06.952 --> 22:08.203
Y'all ever get into that?

22:10.789 --> 22:11.790
No.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.210
And her books just skip right over
that period.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.840
When we were kids,
she'd never wanna talk about it.

22:20.841 --> 22:22.593
I never went to her house.

22:22.676 --> 22:26.847
We always met on the streets
or at Miss Shirley's.

22:28.182 --> 22:32.769
She just appeared one day
like a stray cat that picked us.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.938
Yeah, see. That's what I'm talking about.

22:35.647 --> 22:39.234
What the fuck
could have possibly been going on

22:39.318 --> 22:43.822
that makes a little white girl
feel safer in a Black biker bar?

22:50.078 --> 22:51.788
So how's the mourning coming?

22:53.332 --> 22:55.042
Mourning? For what?

22:55.125 --> 22:58.128
Micah. Y'all's friendship.

22:59.171 --> 23:04.134
You know, stuff like that can be
as intense as a romantic breakup.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.512
I wanna miss her.

23:08.222 --> 23:09.306
I do miss her.

23:10.641 --> 23:13.852
Then I just get pissed, because I--

23:15.687 --> 23:17.231
I don't know what's real.

23:19.191 --> 23:21.151
Did she ever love Josh?

23:22.694 --> 23:25.781
I stifled all of my instincts
to protect her,

23:26.573 --> 23:29.201
and she just took advantage of it.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.079
Why?

23:32.162 --> 23:34.331
What do you mean? Because she could.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.708
-How?
-Don't piss me off, okay?

23:36.792 --> 23:38.877
All right. All right.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.799
You don't have to answer me,
but I'm telling you,

23:43.882 --> 23:45.342
you need to ask yourself.

23:53.809 --> 23:57.521
Chapter 8:
The Incident at the Sapphire Club.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.899
Before the band even took the stage,
I was energized.

24:00.983 --> 24:03.527
They were an extension
of everything I felt inside.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.280
Punk was reduced to embers.

24:06.363 --> 24:07.781
We'd missed the heyday.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.450
Mabuhay Gardens was long gone.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.578
Sound of Music shuttered.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.371
Sapphire on its last legs,

24:14.454 --> 24:15.998
but we claimed as our own,

24:16.081 --> 24:19.835
just to feel the rage of the forgotten
and discarded.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.671
But one man stood out from the crowd.

24:23.380 --> 24:28.010
His eyes burrowed into mine,
unblinking and unsettling.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.262
I thought it was nerves.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.515
"He's just watching me
like everyone else," I told myself.

24:33.599 --> 24:37.352
But his gaze was different.
I could feel him watching.

24:38.437 --> 24:40.606
I tried to lose myself in the songs,

24:40.689 --> 24:42.065
but the sense of unease built

24:42.149 --> 24:45.694
until I could feel it
above the pounding music.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.781
I looked for my friend
but couldn't find her.

24:50.449 --> 24:53.160
I tried to get out through the back,
but he caught up to me…

24:53.243 --> 24:55.746
-Get back here.
-…and dragged me into the storeroom.

24:55.829 --> 24:58.040
-Come here.
-No. No!

24:58.123 --> 25:00.000
-Shut up!
-No. No.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.045
The pain of being punched
in the face was not mine.

25:03.712 --> 25:06.548
It was some other girl's world
being cracked in two.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.509
Pop. Hey, listen.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.595
Take it easy, all right?
Listen, I spoke to the manager.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.681
Now, she was about 12 at the time,
so she doesn't remember shit.

25:15.349 --> 25:16.767
What's the matter? Are you okay?

25:21.730 --> 25:22.731
Noa.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.400
-Hey, what's up?
-I got it.

25:25.484 --> 25:28.862
Rose refilled the prescription
at a free clinic in Jingletown.

25:28.946 --> 25:32.241
She's still in the Bay.
Means we could find her if we hurry.

25:32.324 --> 25:35.077
The clinic is two blocks away
from the Lake Avenue warehouse.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.330
There's a lot of unhoused folks there.
I'll send you the address now.

25:39.206 --> 25:40.874
Thank you. We're on our way.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.502
We're on our way where?

25:44.044 --> 25:45.045
Okay.

25:53.929 --> 25:54.930
Where's Micah?

25:55.848 --> 25:59.309
It's not safe
for her to come see you right now, so…

26:02.938 --> 26:04.064
It's not safe?

26:04.147 --> 26:06.358
Yeah, I mean,
she's just trying to protect you.

26:06.942 --> 26:11.071
And she's trying to protect me too.
I had to fight her to let me help.

26:11.822 --> 26:13.156
She's even trying to protect Rose.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.367
-What do you know about Rose?
-I don't.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.744
I just know
that I don't want her to hurt Micah.

26:19.538 --> 26:21.164
The money will take care of her.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.210
Will it?

26:27.212 --> 26:29.965
Or will Micah
never be able to move on with her life?

26:30.674 --> 26:32.926
The threat of Rose
will always loom over her.

26:34.261 --> 26:38.056
It's just--
We need to do something for Micah.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.837
This is an artist collective

27:08.921 --> 27:12.216
with a mix of displaced people
and creatives.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.384
I have a strong feeling
Rose could be here.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.262
Hey. How you doin'?

27:19.932 --> 27:22.351
-Can I help you?
-You think Rose is here?

27:25.270 --> 27:27.940
Excuse me, you can't just walk in here.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.108
What are you, social services?

27:30.192 --> 27:31.527
Sorry to barge in.

27:32.194 --> 27:34.029
We're not here to cause any problems.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.407
We're just looking for Rose Gil.

27:37.491 --> 27:40.953
-Why are you looking for Rose?
-What do you want Rose for?

27:41.036 --> 27:42.246
Leave her alone.

27:47.251 --> 27:48.252
I'm Rose.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.589
Follow me.

28:06.562 --> 28:08.272
Queen to B-2.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.773
All right. All right.

28:23.078 --> 28:25.205
I recognize your voice from the podcast.

28:25.706 --> 28:27.332
I don't know you.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.668
-He's my friend.
-He's not mine.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.045
All right.
I guess I'll just hang out here.

28:52.441 --> 28:53.901
How'd y'all find me?

28:55.194 --> 28:57.696
You left some things at Holt's place.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.992
Looked like your reunion
got a little out of hand.

29:02.701 --> 29:03.702
You okay?

29:03.785 --> 29:04.870
I'm alive.

29:07.539 --> 29:11.710
I know you have history with
Micah Keith and Holt Rollins.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.545
Not according to Micah's books.

29:14.505 --> 29:15.923
Wouldn't even know I exist.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.133
I'm here to give you
a chance to correct that.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.218
I know.

29:20.135 --> 29:21.595
For your podcast.

29:23.055 --> 29:24.640
I've been looking for you too.

29:24.723 --> 29:27.726
If you're willing to share your story,
I'm willing to listen.

29:28.227 --> 29:30.812
Most people don't believe
what I'm telling them is true.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.397
Is that you?

29:33.190 --> 29:36.109
Am I gonna need to find you
someone to back up what I'm saying?

29:38.445 --> 29:42.199
I'll start with the assumption
that everything you tell me is true.

29:44.326 --> 29:45.869
How about we start with what I know?

29:46.370 --> 29:50.874
You, Micah and Holt
were friends a long time ago.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.128
You were tight.
Maybe even loved each other.

29:56.547 --> 29:57.589
We did.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.467
Until she sent me and Holt to jail.

30:01.635 --> 30:02.636
I'm--

30:06.473 --> 30:09.434
I'm gonna record the rest.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.773
When I got out, I didn't have anything.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.568
But I got by.

30:18.443 --> 30:21.738
Micah was long gone
but that was fine by me.

30:22.614 --> 30:23.907
Until I saw it.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.159
Saw what?

30:26.243 --> 30:27.286
Her book.

30:27.828 --> 30:28.871
My book.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.082
She stole it all.

30:32.666 --> 30:33.750
She stole it all.

30:35.002 --> 30:38.505
She got in my head,
took every memory, everything I had.

30:38.589 --> 30:40.382
Rose, what are you saying?

30:43.385 --> 30:46.013
Micah Keith stole my life.

30:54.521 --> 30:57.274
Talk to me about your grief protocol.

30:57.774 --> 31:00.402
How did that become a staple
of your wellness program?

31:03.989 --> 31:09.161
I had so many women write to me,
come to see me on my book tour,

31:09.244 --> 31:10.495
that were in pain.

31:11.163 --> 31:15.083
Emotional, physical, spiritual…

31:16.251 --> 31:18.420
I saw an opportunity to…

31:19.087 --> 31:22.049
Like the stages
of grief surrounding death,

31:22.799 --> 31:27.221
to develop tools and processes

31:27.304 --> 31:32.142
to help women navigate through
all kinds of losses and disappointments.

31:32.226 --> 31:35.103
-Did you try it out on yourself?
-I did, yeah.

31:35.187 --> 31:37.981
And as I was grieving
the loss of my child--

31:38.065 --> 31:40.025
-The miscarriage?
-Yes.

31:40.609 --> 31:41.610
I thought,

31:42.736 --> 31:46.573
"I wonder if the pain of abandonment
that I've been holding

31:46.657 --> 31:51.703
is actually negatively affecting
my ability to even carry to term?"

31:54.748 --> 31:56.416
In the dark of the night,

31:56.500 --> 31:59.378
I bet that plenty of women
have felt the same way.

31:59.461 --> 32:03.090
Yeah. But we don't talk about it.
Not enough.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.136
I thought by sharing my story,
I could help some women.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.473
That's why the message resonated
with so many of your fans.

32:11.557 --> 32:15.352
It's why I keep telling the truth.
My truth.

32:18.772 --> 32:20.190
My first sketch of her.

32:20.774 --> 32:24.069
You gotta really love someone
to capture their soul like this.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.654
That's what she does.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.239
Makes you wanna take care of her.

32:28.448 --> 32:32.327
After I got out of jail,
I tried focusing on my art.

32:32.995 --> 32:35.414
It worked for a while.
I was getting my shit together.

32:35.914 --> 32:37.165
Until I saw the book.

32:41.712 --> 32:43.046
My drawings.

32:43.547 --> 32:45.132
Pages out of my diary.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.259
My stories, my pain.

32:48.010 --> 32:51.096
None of that happened to her.
It was me. It happened to me.

32:51.597 --> 32:52.973
The attack at the club?

32:53.724 --> 32:56.435
I only went to that show
'cause she asked me to.

32:57.019 --> 32:58.687
Then she dipped out of there without me.

32:59.188 --> 33:01.190
Didn't even know what happened
till I told her after.

33:01.273 --> 33:02.482
I'm so sorry, Rose.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.526
Sorry, sorry.

33:04.610 --> 33:05.694
Everyone's fucking sorry.

33:05.777 --> 33:07.404
Even her husband was sorry.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.865
Did you share any of this with Josh?

33:09.948 --> 33:11.241
Did me no good.

33:18.749 --> 33:20.000
Ever since the book…

33:22.377 --> 33:25.797
I tried to paint
to get out of my own head.

33:28.550 --> 33:29.718
To get away from--

33:30.511 --> 33:33.055
from feeling like nothing.

33:43.273 --> 33:44.942
But none of it mattered.

34:01.792 --> 34:06.797
Rose, did you ever try to come forward
and tell someone what Micah did to you?

34:06.880 --> 34:11.426
I wrote letters
to newspapers and magazines.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.513
I tried calling Micah.

34:15.138 --> 34:18.641
I got booted off of social media
when I posted about it.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.938
Who's gonna believe a homeless
Black girl who's messy in the head?

34:23.021 --> 34:25.565
How does Joshua Keith connect
to all of this?

34:25.649 --> 34:26.984
I know you spoke to him.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.902
Did he know about you and Micah?

34:29.987 --> 34:31.446
Micah wouldn't have told anybody.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.577
That's why you bought a ticket
to see his movie down in LA.

34:37.411 --> 34:38.829
To tell him the truth.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.293
He called me a liar.

34:48.338 --> 34:49.672
Like everyone else.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.927
But then he changed.

34:54.011 --> 34:56.263
-Why?
-I don't know.

34:58.390 --> 35:02.394
I told him that Micah's like
a wild animal when she's trapped.

35:03.937 --> 35:06.648
It's the only way she knows
how to protect herself.

35:07.524 --> 35:09.193
Destroying everyone else in her way.

35:14.573 --> 35:16.241
Joshua came back to see me.

35:18.035 --> 35:19.536
He told me he believed me.

35:21.038 --> 35:22.331
Look.

35:23.624 --> 35:25.709
I made that out of an email he sent me.

35:26.919 --> 35:28.253
"I believe you."

35:53.779 --> 35:56.740
What's going on?
Why is the alarm going?

35:56.823 --> 35:57.991
Is there something happening?

35:58.075 --> 35:59.535
Hey, what's happening?

35:59.618 --> 36:02.704
The alarms. Someone's in the camp.

36:07.751 --> 36:09.002
What's going on?

36:09.086 --> 36:10.337
I think there's a fire.

36:11.547 --> 36:13.674
-It tripped the alarm.
-Everyone evacuate!

36:14.174 --> 36:15.509
Get out of my way.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.848
Run! We gotta get out of here.

36:33.235 --> 36:34.736
Rose!

36:38.532 --> 36:40.617
-Move, move.
-Poppy!

36:40.701 --> 36:43.036
-Rose. Rose.
-You all right?

36:43.120 --> 36:44.788
-I'm all right.
-Here, give her some room.

36:44.872 --> 36:47.457
-Okay. It's Holt. It's Holt. Get Holt.
-Holt?

36:47.541 --> 36:48.584
I got this, I got this.

36:48.667 --> 36:49.668
Rose?

36:57.634 --> 37:00.804
I'm a former nurse. We called 911.
Paramedics are on the way.

37:00.888 --> 37:04.016
Okay. Oh, God.

37:27.122 --> 37:28.123
Fuck off.

37:36.590 --> 37:37.799
Break it up!

37:37.883 --> 37:39.635
-Hey, break it up!
-Get off him!

37:39.718 --> 37:42.221
-Gun! Gun! Get off him!
-Hands where I can see them now!

37:42.304 --> 37:43.639
Markus!

37:43.722 --> 37:44.806
Markus!

37:44.890 --> 37:46.099
Show me your fucking hands!

37:46.183 --> 37:47.434
-All right, listen--
-Markus!

37:47.518 --> 37:49.394
-Fucking hands on the ground!
-All right, listen! He's the shooter.

37:49.478 --> 37:50.771
He's your shooter. All right?

37:50.854 --> 37:53.273
Now listen, I'm former OPD.

37:53.357 --> 37:55.442
-All I'm gonna do is reach for my ID--
-No, no--

37:58.403 --> 37:59.488
Markus!

37:59.571 --> 38:01.031
On your belly!

38:01.114 --> 38:02.908
-You shot the wrong man!
-On your belly right now!

38:02.991 --> 38:04.660
All right! All right.

38:06.620 --> 38:07.996
Oh, God.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.878
Hands up! Spread 'em!

38:16.547 --> 38:18.215
Markus.

38:20.342 --> 38:22.427
Poppy.

38:22.511 --> 38:24.304
-Call Zarina, okay?
-Okay.

38:24.388 --> 38:25.556
Make sure you call her.

38:28.350 --> 38:30.269
Oh, God.

38:30.352 --> 38:36.024
Code blue.
Code blue in 359. Code blue in 359.

38:36.108 --> 38:37.901
Poppy? What happened?

38:37.985 --> 38:40.320
Markus was shot.
We were working together on a case.

38:40.404 --> 38:44.074
-A case? Markus works at Shelter.
-We were interviewing someone--

38:44.157 --> 38:46.952
I don't have time for this, and I
don't wanna hear any of this from you.

38:47.035 --> 38:48.829
Where's my husband?

38:48.912 --> 38:50.122
He's in surgery.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.165
I'm sorry.

38:52.958 --> 38:55.460
You're sorry. What does that even mean?

38:57.337 --> 38:58.338
I'm sorry.

38:59.131 --> 39:01.341
Let's go see what we can find out.

39:01.425 --> 39:03.969
I don't want you here.

39:21.653 --> 39:22.905
Markus.

39:36.251 --> 39:37.419
Please.

39:50.682 --> 39:52.309
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey.

39:53.352 --> 39:54.686
How are you feeling?

39:55.395 --> 39:56.522
Shot.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.149
God, you scared me.

40:02.152 --> 40:04.112
Where's Trini?

40:04.196 --> 40:05.572
She's at my parents.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.159
She will be so happy to see you.

40:11.495 --> 40:13.705
Ever since we've gotten back together,

40:14.581 --> 40:16.166
I've been calling you my wife.

40:17.334 --> 40:19.670
And you've been calling me your husband.

40:19.753 --> 40:23.090
Well, technically we are still divorced.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.592
Still divorced?

40:27.511 --> 40:28.887
Why don't we fix that?

40:33.183 --> 40:35.102
We can talk about that later.

40:36.979 --> 40:39.273
Markus, how did this happen?

40:39.982 --> 40:41.316
Wrestling with a suspect.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.068
A suspect--

40:44.319 --> 40:46.363
You're not a cop anymore.

40:46.446 --> 40:48.282
Yeah. Well,

40:49.157 --> 40:53.036
maybe if I was,
that piece of shit wouldn't have shot me.

40:58.208 --> 40:59.293
Who is it?

41:05.465 --> 41:06.758
Not right now.

41:09.136 --> 41:11.597
This is Markus Killebrew,
you know what to do.

41:12.890 --> 41:16.310
Markus, it's me.

41:17.853 --> 41:19.146
Just checking in.

41:20.564 --> 41:23.400
I can't get any info from the doctors.

41:24.401 --> 41:25.444
So call me.

41:39.666 --> 41:40.709
Demetri--

41:40.792 --> 41:42.711
You better have
a good reason why you're not here.

41:42.794 --> 41:44.922
Mediation starts in, like, 15 minutes.

41:45.005 --> 41:48.675
Shit. I forgot all about it.

41:48.759 --> 41:50.302
Come on, Poppy.

41:50.385 --> 41:52.137
-Markus got shot.
-What?

41:53.555 --> 41:55.224
Is he okay?

41:55.307 --> 41:56.808
I'm trying to find out.

41:57.434 --> 41:59.895
All right, look. I'll let everyone know
about your emergency.

41:59.978 --> 42:02.105
Well, they have to understand that--

42:02.189 --> 42:05.275
No, sweetheart. They don't, all right?
But I'm gonna do what I can.

42:07.027 --> 42:09.696
-Do I need to drive to the city?
-No, no.

42:09.780 --> 42:12.491
What you need to do is get your head
in the game, all right?

42:12.574 --> 42:13.909
And to keep me posted.

42:29.758 --> 42:33.178
I just got a call from Zarina Killebrew.
Markus was shot.

42:33.262 --> 42:35.556
Jesus. Is he okay?

42:35.639 --> 42:38.809
The police shot him and arrested Holt.

42:38.892 --> 42:40.727
And what about Rose? Did they find her?

42:40.811 --> 42:43.063
She's unconscious in the hospital.

42:43.939 --> 42:48.777
She was shot by Holt.
Ivy, what did you do?

42:51.113 --> 42:54.324
She was our friend.
He would have never hurt her.

42:54.408 --> 42:55.659
What did you say to him?

42:55.742 --> 42:58.871
I gave him the cash, and that's it.

42:59.788 --> 43:01.498
I didn't say anything else.

43:05.502 --> 43:07.504
You know why this is happening, right?

43:15.470 --> 43:16.680
Poppy.
