WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:05.306
CAROL:
Knock, knock.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.474
Good morning.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.608
Mom, all I'm
saying is

00:07.641 --> 00:09.177
if I'm gonna drive you places,

00:09.210 --> 00:10.711
you can't stick
your head out the window

00:10.744 --> 00:12.380
and offer rides
to complete strangers.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.716
Well, she was cute,
you're single.

00:15.749 --> 00:19.487
I didn't know she was homeless
until she smiled.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.189
I'm just gonna, uh... I'm gonna
grab some Febreze and a rag.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.290
DEBBIE:
Okay.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.558
Have fun at school,
and remember, the bus is free.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.894
Don't let the driver
trick you again, okay?

00:30.764 --> 00:33.501
Debbie, your father
called me last night.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.803
He thinks when the movers
packed our stuff

00:35.836 --> 00:37.138
they stole his socks.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.207
Why would someone
steal his socks?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.242
Everyone has feet, Debbie.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.447
Well, look at sleepyhead,
just waking up.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.183
When we were married,
I had him out of bed by 6:00.

00:49.217 --> 00:52.520
My main incentive was
beating her to the toilet.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.625
Well, he got a book yesterday
on the Civil War.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.393
He was up all night.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.595
You can never let him have
history books after 9:00.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.164
He'll never go down.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.099
I can stay up
as late as I like.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.301
What's that thing
your buddy Ray says?

01:07.335 --> 01:10.271
Uh... I'm an
ass-grown something...

01:10.304 --> 01:11.739
Grown-ass man?

01:13.874 --> 01:17.411
I'm a grown assman.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.114
A grown assman who,

01:20.148 --> 01:22.250
if he doesn't take his pills
by 8:00 a.m.,

01:22.283 --> 01:23.884
gets even more dizzy
and foggy-headed

01:23.917 --> 01:25.486
than he already is.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.887
Find his pills.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.190
I'll go look through
the boxes in the basement

01:29.223 --> 01:31.392
and see if I can solve
this sock mystery.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.593
(phone beeps)

01:32.626 --> 01:34.328
PHONE VOICE:
Reminder Nathan:

01:34.362 --> 01:38.132
Your family plan is
eligible for a phone upgrade.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.099
What was that?

01:39.133 --> 01:41.702
It's my personal assistant app
on my phone.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.471
Did she say you're
getting a new phone?

01:43.504 --> 01:44.772
Yeah, I'm getting
a new phone tonight,

01:44.805 --> 01:46.540
which means you are eligible
for my old phone.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.609
Yes! I love phone-me-downs.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.212
I finally get a phone with apps.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.247
The only game
this phone plays is Catch.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.248
Catch, Adam.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.649
(chortles)

01:55.683 --> 01:56.650
I get your phone?

01:56.684 --> 01:58.152
That is awesome.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.353
It's gonna be nice
to have a phone

01:59.387 --> 02:01.422
with a "7" button
that works again.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.457
You know, I can't call
America's Most Wanted.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.752
Found
your socks.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.421
For some reason,
you packed them

02:33.454 --> 02:35.756
with a bunch
of seashells.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.558
Gonna throw 'em
in the wash.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.494
Your feet smell enough
like low tide as it is.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.697
What are you doing?

02:43.731 --> 02:45.266
Thinking
about breakfast.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.335
You're gonna have salad dressing
for breakfast?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.603
I haven't ruled it out.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.871
Wh...

02:50.904 --> 02:51.872
Just sit down.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.408
I'll make you some eggs.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.577
You're absolutely useless.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.846
When you had the bright idea
to divorce me,

02:58.879 --> 03:01.482
did you ever consider how
you were gonna feed yourself?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.817
Perhaps I thought
"slow death by salad dressing"

03:03.851 --> 03:06.654
was preferable.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.858
The plan is under
Nathan Miller.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.726
You probably
recognize the name.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.263
My son's a TV reporter,

03:15.296 --> 03:16.664
uh, so if there are
any extra perks

03:16.697 --> 03:17.831
for people on television...

03:17.865 --> 03:18.832
Mom...

03:18.866 --> 03:20.234
Oh, here you are.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.635
Ooh, looks like
you're eligible for

03:21.669 --> 03:23.237
not one but five upgrades.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.638
See?
It worked.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.640
I'm sorry, did you say
we have five upgrades?

03:26.674 --> 03:27.975
Does that mean that
we all can get...

03:28.008 --> 03:29.677
Now, hold on, hold on.
They're not our upgrades,

03:29.710 --> 03:30.678
they're my upgrades.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.579
I like to hold
onto them in case

03:31.612 --> 03:32.846
I break or
lose my phone.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.848
It means I don't have
to pay to replace it, so...

03:34.882 --> 03:36.417
Just...
just the one phone.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.986
My son's very sensible
when it comes to money.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.888
You know, he's also single.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.856
Do you have a sister
who's maybe...

03:42.890 --> 03:45.426
I don't know, a little more
put together than you are?

03:45.459 --> 03:46.627
DEBBIE:
Mom.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.396
Mom.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.397
I'm sorry.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.564
She grew up near power lines.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.401
Where were you?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.768
I bought
some shorts.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.404
They looked great
on the mannequin.

03:56.437 --> 04:00.374
Well, they look ridiculous
on the dummy.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.644
What the hell's going on
with your socks?

04:03.677 --> 04:04.678
They don't match.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.381
They're both black.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.882
Close enough.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.883
Close enough?

04:09.917 --> 04:10.951
You look like
a crazy man!

04:10.984 --> 04:12.953
Okay, Mom, just let it be.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.622
Easy for you
to say.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.624
I didn't spend my whole day
yesterday doing the laundry

04:16.657 --> 04:17.858
so he could
come in here

04:17.891 --> 04:19.427
looking like
a German tourist

04:19.460 --> 04:21.462
with a wooden leg.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.565
Look, Mom,
you're not married anymore.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.033
You don't have
to do Dad's laundry.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.701
Who else is
going to do it?

04:27.735 --> 04:28.936
Him?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.638
Without me,
he's a disaster.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.840
Last week he tried
to fold his own clothes,

04:32.873 --> 04:34.642
got his head stuck
in a turtleneck

04:34.675 --> 04:37.745
and somehow ended up
in the neighbor's pool.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.480
That was wild.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.849
Their dog was
freaking out.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.618
Look, we all know that
Dad has challenges

04:44.652 --> 04:46.720
when it comes to...
living.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.590
But you're kind of the reason
that he's like this.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.859
Excuse me?

04:51.892 --> 04:54.628
Oh, it's-it's something
that both Debbie and I

04:54.662 --> 04:55.863
were-were
discussing.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.398
What was it, Debbie,
that your point was?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.533
Well, we agreed, actually,

04:59.567 --> 05:01.669
that maybe the reason
Dad never learned

05:01.702 --> 05:02.936
how to survive on his own

05:02.970 --> 05:04.605
because you were always
yelling at him,

05:04.638 --> 05:06.073
and pushing him out of the way

05:06.106 --> 05:07.341
and doing everything for him.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.577
That... that was the point you
were making, Nathan, I believe.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.412
You don't have to take
care of Dad anymore.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.013
Okay?
You're separated now.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.648
Live your own life.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.116
Go get your groove back.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.885
Go to Jamaica.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.721
Find your Taye Diggs.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.922
Right, yeah.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.757
And if-if Dad needs help,
I'll be there

05:23.791 --> 05:26.827
to gently and lovingly
provide some guidance.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.629
(sarcastically):
Okay.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.697
You do that.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.632
'Cause it's so easy.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.734
All he needs is
a little loving guidance.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
Nice knowing you, Tom.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.572
He'll be dead in a week.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.508
Look, Mom,
Dad is not an idiot.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.975
Okay?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.744
He was lead engineer at
North America's number two

05:43.777 --> 05:45.879
manufacturer
of non-woven fabrics.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.617
The guy practically invented
the moist towelette.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.686
Our father is a smart,
capable man who,

05:52.720 --> 05:53.821
if left to his own...

05:53.854 --> 05:55.789
What's going on
over there, Dad?

05:55.823 --> 05:57.958
It appears I forgot
to pay for the shorts.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.894
We're gonna have
to see your I.D.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.463
Oh...

06:02.496 --> 06:05.533
I-I must've I left
my wallet in my pants.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.468
Where are my pants?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.837
Oh! You might want to try
the ladies' dressing room.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.072
They hustled me out
of there in a hurry.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.610
Dead in a week.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.153
Knowing how much
your mom still does
for your dad,

06:26.186 --> 06:28.656
are we nervous about
letting him make
breakfast alone?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.890
What do you think,

06:29.923 --> 06:31.525
my dad's going
to burn down the house?

06:31.559 --> 06:32.793
Yes.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.927
Look, all
I'm suggesting

06:33.961 --> 06:35.629
is that maybe
there's a polite way

06:35.663 --> 06:38.599
that we could ask him
to stay in the yard.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.635
We could put some
food in the shade.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.671
Morning, Dad.
Morning.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.872
So, I've got
everything ready

06:44.905 --> 06:46.707
for you to make
your own breakfast.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.743
Okay, I've got a bowl,
spoon, milk

06:49.777 --> 06:50.844
and choice of cereals.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.513
Ooh, I don't like cereal.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.448
It's like dog food for people.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.616
Okay.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.817
Uh, what did you
have in mind?

06:56.850 --> 06:59.753
Well, could you show me how
to make a homemade biscuit?

06:59.787 --> 07:00.754
(quietly):
Oven.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.590
Adam...

07:02.623 --> 07:04.958
Well, biscuits
are a pretty
complex recipe, Dad.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.494
Good point.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.862
I also like
a nice western omelet.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.863
Stove.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.864
Oh, omelets
are easy.

07:10.898 --> 07:11.865
Yes. Yeah.
Um...

07:11.899 --> 07:13.133
We got the pan right there,

07:13.166 --> 07:14.635
non-stick spray,
eggs...

07:14.668 --> 07:15.869
Great.
DEBBIE:
Great.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.572
So we're gonna head to work.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.874
How much of the egg
goes in the actual omelet?

07:20.908 --> 07:21.875
Um...

07:21.909 --> 07:23.477
all of it.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.978
Uh, and-and, uh...

07:25.012 --> 07:26.880
there's no, uh...

07:26.914 --> 07:28.716
no feathers in here,
obviously.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.117
Obviously.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.118
(Tom chuckles)

07:31.151 --> 07:32.252
TOM:
And the...

07:32.285 --> 07:34.688
the same knob that turns
the heat on turns it off, right?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.691
That was crazy.
Don't answer that one.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.892
I'm good.

07:38.926 --> 07:39.893
Yes, you are good.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.929
And we have faith
in you, Dad.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.497
Okay!

07:43.531 --> 07:45.499
TOM:
Okay.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.667
This is exactly what he needs

07:46.700 --> 07:47.768
to build his confidence,
you know?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.037
People who trust him enough
not to hover over him.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.038
Oh, wait a minute.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.205
I forgot my purse.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.147
You go on ahead.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.516
I'm just gonna
hover for a bit.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.121
Wow, that's a lot of beads.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.991
Tell me you did not
earn those at Mardi Gras.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.096
These are my craft supplies.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.632
Now that I'm not spending all
my days shouting at your father,

08:18.666 --> 08:21.702
I can express my emotions
in a more creative way.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.005
By the way, what color would you
like your toaster sweater to be?

08:25.038 --> 08:28.108
Is "invisible" an option?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.643
Doesn't matter.
Probably won't have time

08:29.677 --> 08:30.778
to pick out a color anyway

08:30.811 --> 08:34.314
before your sister calls
and begs me to take over again.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.249
Look, she's gonna
be fine with Dad.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.619
Debbie is the most
patient person I know.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.254
She used to walk her turtle.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.090
(phone rings)

08:44.124 --> 08:45.626
Oh, it's Debbie.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.828
Here we go. Pack it up.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.263
Hey, Debbie. How's it going?

08:50.297 --> 08:52.265
He got egg
on my ceiling.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.201
(chuckling):
No way.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.604
Dad made breakfast.
(chuckles)

08:56.637 --> 08:57.938
It's my fault.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.140
I tried to flip the eggs
in the pan real high

09:00.173 --> 09:02.275
like in the cartoons.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.343
Yeah.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.212
Except it's
pancakes they flip.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.948
And it's cartoons.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.283
They're-they're laughing
about how delicious it was.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.986
So, other than breakfast,
how's it going?

09:13.020 --> 09:14.988
Yeah, well, he, uh,
flooded my laundry room

09:15.022 --> 09:16.790
by using too much soap.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.992
He ruined
my favorite moccasins!

09:19.026 --> 09:20.661
I got married in these.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.163
What?! Did he?

09:23.196 --> 09:26.099
Dad did his own laundry.

09:26.133 --> 09:26.934
Wait, Dad.
Dad, are you dizzy?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.335
Did you take your pills
this morning?

09:28.368 --> 09:29.670
Not yet.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.739
So go take 'em
before you pass out.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.106
I think they're in my pants.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.608
So go get your pants.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.609
That's gonna be tough.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.177
They're in the washing machine.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.779
Are you kidding me?!

09:38.812 --> 09:40.781
Seriously, Dad,
you washed your pills?!

09:40.814 --> 09:43.216
How do you not feel a giant
pill bottle in your pocket

09:43.250 --> 09:45.152
when you're taking off
your pants?!

09:45.185 --> 09:47.154
There's a spatula in here!

09:47.187 --> 09:49.623
Why is there a spatula in here?!

09:49.657 --> 09:52.760
Well, it sounds like you got it
all under control.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.161
Get over here, Nathan!

09:54.194 --> 09:55.162
I can't do this on my own!

09:55.195 --> 09:57.097
Adam was right. We should've
put you in the yard.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.132
You need to be an outside dad!

10:02.302 --> 10:04.738
(blow-dryer whirring)

10:04.772 --> 10:06.940
Adam, do you have
half a heart pill?

10:06.974 --> 10:09.409
I have two quarter-crumbs
that would combine for a dose.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.811
This is either half a pill

10:10.844 --> 10:12.880
or Mikayla's baby tooth
we never found.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.414
Just give it to him.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.816
You don't know what it is.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.084
Just eat it, okay?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.318
Best case, you lower
your blood pressure.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.054
Worst case, the tooth fairy
leaves a quarter in your toilet.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.923
What's going on?

10:22.956 --> 10:26.126
You've had Dad for three hours
and you've turned into Mom.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.127
She's worse than Mom.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.295
She slapped me.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.763
I was gonna punch him,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.098
but at the last second
I opened my hand,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.166
so I should be congratulated.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.434
Okay. Well, calm
down, calm down.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.836
I can see what's
going on here.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.270
Somebody's got a little
too much Mom in her.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.075
Excuse me?

10:42.109 --> 10:44.144
Look, Mom is who she is
and you being her daughter,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.680
it only makes sense that you
share some of the same...

10:46.714 --> 10:49.349
DNA that makes her
so... frightening.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.084
Mm-hmm. Okay.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.219
You want him?

10:52.252 --> 10:55.088
He's all yours.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.423
Mom, pack a bag.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.125
You're going to Debbie's.

10:58.158 --> 11:02.229
Dad's staying with me until
he can learn to live on his own.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.133
Why is your ear red?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.134
She slapped me.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.838
Good for her.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.214
Dad, I know you're
a smart guy,

11:21.248 --> 11:22.983
so what's the deal?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.285
I guess I'm just
a little forgetful and clumsy

11:25.318 --> 11:27.254
and easily distracted.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.257
There's a fourth one I was gonna
say, but it escapes me.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.727
Smart guy, acts dumb.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.763
What if he's got that
Rain Man genius thing?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.397
Hear me out, man.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.867
We could clean it up
at all the casinos.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.136
How many chips
did I just pour
on the table?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.773
47. Definitely 47.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.275
Eee! Come on, Nate!
We could get rich!

11:48.308 --> 11:50.077
You a rain man!

11:50.110 --> 11:51.378
Tom, you are a rain man!

11:51.411 --> 11:53.914
A card-counting,
casino-crushing rain man!

11:53.947 --> 11:55.783
Maybe it's more like 60.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.418
Could be a hundred.

11:58.451 --> 12:01.121
That was a fun half minute.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.324
Look, Dad, how did you function
at work all those years?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.458
Mom wasn't there with you.

12:05.492 --> 12:09.262
Well, non-woven fabrics has
always come naturally to me.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.165
But my secretary helped me out
with the real tricky stuff

12:12.199 --> 12:16.436
like dialing outside lines,
where we kept the bathroom key.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.271
Yeah, Edna!
She was great.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.907
And she never yelled.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.209
Well, sure, because
she was being paid.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.044
You don't think we could hire
her, do you?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.779
I'd love to see her.

12:25.813 --> 12:29.182
She must be in her late...

12:29.216 --> 12:30.550
110 by now.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.254
Yeah, I don't know
if Edna's the answer,

12:34.287 --> 12:37.524
but you know,
maybe hiring someone is.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.293
We just need to find somebody
to constantly follow you around

12:40.327 --> 12:42.062
and help you get through
your day

12:42.095 --> 12:44.031
without slapping you
on the side of the head.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.966
I was gonna recommend
my cousin

12:45.999 --> 12:47.300
till you mentioned
the slapping part.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.668
(phone beeps)

12:48.701 --> 12:54.341
PHONE VOICE:
Remember to pick up
your dry cleaning today at 5:00.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.414
(phone beeps)

13:01.448 --> 13:04.885
Time to wake up
and take your pills, Tom.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.221
Why, thank you, phone.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.461
How do I make coffee
with a SureCup 600?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.529
Searching the Web
for instructions

13:16.563 --> 13:19.967
for the SureCup 600, Tom.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.202
Thank you.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.873
And, uh...

13:25.906 --> 13:28.008
can you call me "Gorgeous"?

13:28.041 --> 13:31.511
From now on,
I'll call you... Gorgeous.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.921
How do I get home from the mall?

13:40.954 --> 13:45.625
Finding directions home,
Gorgeous.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.228
Can you tell me a joke
while we wait?

13:48.261 --> 13:51.398
Where did Napoleon keep
his armies?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.333
In his sleevies.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.435
Ha-ha, ha-ha.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.370
It's 9:00.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.940
Time to stop reading
and go to sleep.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.275
Good night, Gorgeous.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.317
Good night, my love.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.293
You gotta take Mom back.
She's driving me crazy.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.896
90% of her day used
to be yelling at Dad.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.966
She's filling that void
with crafts.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.135
Too many crafts.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.971
(gasping):
Slow down, speedy.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.539
Wow, nice outfit, Mom.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.341
Oh, thanks.
(chuckles)

14:34.374 --> 14:36.443
Taking care of your dad's
got you drinking

14:36.476 --> 14:38.211
at 4:00
in the afternoon, huh?

14:38.245 --> 14:41.915
At least I had the social grace
to hide mine in a coffee mug.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.918
Oh, this cocktail
is celebratory.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.220
See, I'm no longer dealing
with Tom Miller,

14:47.254 --> 14:50.190
the man who once brushed his
teeth with mint chip ice cream.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.391
No, no, no.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.428
I've been spending my days
with a brand-new man.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.966
May I introduce to you one

14:58.999 --> 15:00.968
Mr. Thomas Miller?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.069
Good evening, ladies.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.436
Margarita?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.438
Is he cooking?

15:05.472 --> 15:09.642
I was just whipping up
a little pico de gallo.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.145
He's a new man.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.547
He cooks, he gets himself up
in the morning,

15:14.581 --> 15:15.548
gets around town

15:15.582 --> 15:16.383
without getting lost.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.152
I fixed him.
And I didn't yell once.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.387
In the last two days,

15:20.420 --> 15:21.688
the loudest thing
in my apartment

15:21.721 --> 15:24.624
has been your outfit.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.697
It's time to take your early
evening medicine, Gorgeous.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.301
What is that?

15:34.334 --> 15:37.037
This is Carol 2.0.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.638
I had to find a better model

15:38.671 --> 15:41.308
'cause the original Carol
didn't have a volume control

15:41.341 --> 15:43.010
and you couldn't turn her off.

15:43.043 --> 15:43.977
That's very funny.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.313
Hold on. I've got another one.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.249
The original Carol also didn't
have voice mail,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.717
(low voice):
just a male voice.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.986
Yeah, we get it, Tom.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.654
Hold on, hold on. Last one.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.223
The original Carol

15:56.256 --> 15:58.491
also was too loud, too bulky,

15:58.525 --> 16:00.427
and ten years ago,
she switched to vibrate.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.631
Told you I could fix him.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.335
Oh, you're not taking credit
for this.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.769
You know,
the other night,

16:09.802 --> 16:13.706
Carol 2.0 took me to this
great little Italian place.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.142
Huh.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.077
Ricotta doesn't give her
the trots.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.713
Come on. Admit it,
I fixed him.
No, you didn't.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.682
The phone's the one
doing all the work.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.717
Yeah, but my rational approach
to the problem

16:24.751 --> 16:26.453
helped find the solution.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.023
Just admit that I am calm
and you and Mom are volatile.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.324
Okay, you got lucky
with the phone.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.693
Mom and I are just as calm
and rational...

16:33.726 --> 16:36.696
TOM:
Get your hands off of my phone!
You're gonna hurt her!

16:38.431 --> 16:40.433
(grunting)

16:40.467 --> 16:43.036
Your new girlfriend can do
everything, huh?

16:46.473 --> 16:49.609
Well, she's not much
of a fighter!

16:54.814 --> 16:57.217
And that's why
I save my upgrades.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.493
I don't know
what happened to me.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.397
Seeing him so happy,
I got... jealous.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.065
Mom, it was a phone.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.800
How are you gonna react
when he actually starts dating?

17:13.833 --> 17:16.169
You can't smash a woman's
face in for kissing him.

17:16.203 --> 17:20.807
Please. If some poor woman
is gonna kiss your father,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.343
whatever's happening to her face
is far worse than anything

17:23.376 --> 17:26.546
I could do
with a meat tenderizer.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.782
Maybe jealous
is the wrong word.

17:29.816 --> 17:33.786
I just always thought that even
if I yelled at your dad,

17:33.820 --> 17:35.488
it was for his own good.

17:35.522 --> 17:41.161
But when I saw him tonight...

17:41.194 --> 17:43.863
What if I wasted my whole life
thinking he needed me,

17:43.896 --> 17:47.334
and now that he doesn't,
all I'm left with

17:47.367 --> 17:50.770
is a hot glue gun
and a sack of rhinestones?

17:50.803 --> 17:51.838
Look at me.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.675
I look like Liberace had sex
with a Fabergé egg.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.845
Mr. Miller?
Yeah?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.213
That'll be $400.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.582
No, no, no. I had
three free upgrades.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.684
Uh, no, not according
to this.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.354
It says all your upgrades
were used this weekend

18:07.387 --> 18:09.122
by a Thomas Miller.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.162
Uh, Dad?

18:15.195 --> 18:18.798
Something happen
with the phone this weekend?

18:18.831 --> 18:21.301
Oh, yeah.
I had a little accident.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.636
(video game trilling)

18:23.670 --> 18:25.905
(phone rings)

18:25.938 --> 18:28.141
(water splashes)

18:45.692 --> 18:47.794
(sneezes)

18:47.827 --> 18:50.597
How'd you go through
three phones in two days?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.166
That's over a thousand
dollars' worth of phones

18:53.200 --> 18:55.202
literally down the toilet.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.636
They were very slippery.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.704
Especially in
a moist environment.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.839
Well, why didn't you just
put it in your pocket

18:59.872 --> 19:00.973
like a normal person?

19:01.007 --> 19:03.776
You put it in there, and then
when you need it, you...

19:03.810 --> 19:07.247
What happened to my phone?
Wait. I had it in the car.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.749
Oh, yeah, it slid
under your seat.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.493
Nate, I think you dropped...

19:22.262 --> 19:23.930
...dropped some weight.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.965
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

19:25.998 --> 19:27.834
How could one person
be so careless?!

19:27.867 --> 19:30.570
My phone would have been safer
in the hands of a toddler.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.473
I could put a toddler
in a whitewater raft

19:33.506 --> 19:35.708
and I replace his little hands
with goat hooves,

19:35.742 --> 19:38.245
and he would have been less
clumsy than you!

19:38.278 --> 19:39.779
Okay, okay,
what is wrong with you?!

19:39.812 --> 19:41.981
Yeah, yeah, what happened
to calm and rational?

19:42.014 --> 19:42.882
No, it can't be done!

19:42.915 --> 19:45.285
I am so sorry
that I criticized you guys.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.520
The flaw is not the women
in this family,

19:47.554 --> 19:48.655
the flaw is him.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.258
Fine.
Maybe the phone was a bad idea.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.760
Live and learn.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.362
NATHAN:
He doesn't even care.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.265
I just yelled at him
in the middle of a store

19:58.298 --> 19:59.832
and it rolls off
his back.

19:59.866 --> 20:00.967
This is nothing.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.437
I practically pulled down
his pants and spanked him

20:04.471 --> 20:06.506
at a Souplantation
a few years ago.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.941
I rounded a corner to find him
standing in a two-foot tall

20:08.975 --> 20:13.980
pile of soft serve ice cream
just grinning like a chimp.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.582
What are we gonna
do with him?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.685
I don't know.
He's a sweet guy,
and I love him.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.752
I hate yelling at him.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.753
Yeah, me, too.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.355
It's my fault.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.625
I knew what I was
getting into the
night I met him.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.694
I should never have
given him my number.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.562
I should have just rolled off

20:29.596 --> 20:31.364
the hood of his car
and hobbled away.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.465
I got us into this mess.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.402
I'll do my best to teach him
how to live on his own.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.703
But I'm gonna do things my way.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.439
I don't want to hear any bunk
from either of you

20:39.472 --> 20:41.474
if I yell at him too much.

20:41.508 --> 20:46.379
Mom, beat him with a rubber hose
if you have to.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.648
I don't know how you've kept
this up for 43 years.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.884
It's true.
You are a hero
and a saint.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.787
That's all I ever wanted
to hear.

20:57.724 --> 21:02.629
Let's get you home...
Gorgeous.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.597
That's all
I ever wanted to hear.
