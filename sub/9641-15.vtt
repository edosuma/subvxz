00:15.701 --> 00:19.136
Making my own... take
a lot longer than I thought.

00:20.439 --> 00:22.640
Dude, that
was so much fun!

00:22.674 --> 00:26.077
I don't remember the Wizard County
Fair being that crowded last year.

00:26.111 --> 00:28.601
That's because this is the first year
they have the elf-stacking contest.

00:28.635 --> 00:31.376
Demeaning, but fun.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.074
Thanks for
taking me, guys.

00:33.108 --> 00:35.045
I just can't get enough
of these corn dogs.

00:35.079 --> 00:38.346
Those aren't corn dogs.
They're fried unicorn horns.

00:42.832 --> 00:45.042
A fried unicorn horn
has all the nutrients

00:45.076 --> 00:46.844
a human needs
for an entire year.

00:46.878 --> 00:50.660
It's like eating 10,000 pounds of
vegetables without all the chewing.

00:50.694 --> 00:53.596
Why are the prettiest
animals so delicious?

00:59.339 --> 01:02.611
Hey, how come I didn't get to
go to the fair with you guys?

01:02.645 --> 01:05.915
It was ladies' night, but
we did bring you something.

01:05.949 --> 01:08.051
A lady,
possibly bearded?

01:08.952 --> 01:09.886
Here.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.688
It's a corn dog seed.

01:11.722 --> 01:14.323
Go plant it, and you can
have your own corn dog tree.

01:14.358 --> 01:16.425
I don't think
this is gonna work.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.294
This obviously isn't
a corn dog seed,

01:18.328 --> 01:20.930
it's a stick seed. Why
would I grow a stick tree?

01:23.102 --> 01:26.372
- You could build a fort.
- I'm gonna build a fort. Thanks, guys!

01:28.044 --> 01:29.878
Nice work.

01:29.913 --> 01:32.049
You must've had some good times
messing with your brother.

01:33.253 --> 01:36.323
Yeah. Before we stopped
talking to each other,

01:36.358 --> 01:39.595
I used to mess with Warren
all the time.

01:39.630 --> 01:43.000
Well, you are free
to mess with my brothers

01:43.034 --> 01:45.136
any time you want, because
that's what friends are for.

01:45.171 --> 01:46.873
Now come on, blow it up.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.709
I've gotta get going.

01:55.251 --> 01:57.521
She really doesn't like
blowing it up.

01:58.757 --> 02:00.691
I think that was about
her brother.

02:00.726 --> 02:02.894
She must really
miss him.

02:02.929 --> 02:04.831
You know what
we should do?

02:04.865 --> 02:06.466
We should help them
get back together.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.835
That's a totally
nice thing to do.

02:08.870 --> 02:11.539
We should do it 'cause you
never come up with those.

02:11.574 --> 02:14.510
Yeah. Sometimes I think
them, but I never say them.

02:14.544 --> 02:16.980
This one I did, so
let's see how it goes.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

03:14.850 --> 03:18.954
So, I was thinking that we should
help Stevie find her brother.

03:18.989 --> 03:23.159
That is a very
nice idea, Harper.

03:23.194 --> 03:25.896
No, Alex came up with
this one all on her own.

03:27.065 --> 03:29.000
Then we should do it.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.102
All right, now let's go
look him up on the Wiznet.

03:31.136 --> 03:33.872
Sorry, we can't. The Wiznet's
down. It's over capacity.

03:33.906 --> 03:36.274
Oh, that's it, we're done.
We tried.

03:37.777 --> 03:39.711
Okay, I know you're new
to doing good deeds,

03:39.746 --> 03:41.313
but let me give you
a piece of advice:

03:41.347 --> 03:45.851
When things get harder,
you can keep trying.

03:45.885 --> 03:47.652
It just feels
more natural to quit,

03:47.687 --> 03:49.688
but, okay, let's keep
rolling with it.

03:51.124 --> 03:53.258
Alex, being older than you,

03:53.292 --> 03:55.861
I remember a time
before the Wiznet,

03:55.895 --> 03:59.197
back when we had to use
things like this.

03:59.232 --> 04:01.734
A jack-in-the-box?
Okay. Come on, Harper.

04:01.768 --> 04:04.504
Let's go find Warren while
Justin plays with his baby toys.

04:06.006 --> 04:08.308
Locate: Warren Nichols.

04:18.253 --> 04:21.355
Warren Nichols is on the
west side of the wizard world.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.891
Thank you very much,
old buddy,

04:22.925 --> 04:24.726
and can I get
an address, please?

04:24.760 --> 04:27.696
- Put me back in.
- Hey, you got it.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.568
Okay.

04:36.006 --> 04:38.407
Just tell us where he is!

04:38.441 --> 04:40.174
He's located
at City Hall,

04:40.209 --> 04:42.844
1313 Mockingbird Lane.

04:42.879 --> 04:44.245
Come on, let's go.

04:50.452 --> 04:51.786
Come on.

05:00.529 --> 05:03.497
Why is everything in
the wizard world so confusing?

05:03.531 --> 05:06.100
That's what wizards say
about the real world.

05:06.134 --> 05:09.470
I didn't expect the Wizard City
Hall to just be one endless hallway.

05:09.505 --> 05:10.771
Dude, we're never
gonna find Warren.

05:10.806 --> 05:12.874
We don't even know
which room he's in.

05:12.908 --> 05:15.176
Hmm, well, we could've
asked the jack-in-the-box

05:15.210 --> 05:17.512
if someone didn't
get annoyed and break him!

05:19.147 --> 05:21.916
Hey! The guy has a name tag
that says "Warren."

05:21.950 --> 05:23.384
Maybe he knows
where Warren is.

05:23.418 --> 05:24.686
People with the same names,

05:24.720 --> 05:27.021
they tend to keep tabs
on each other.

05:27.055 --> 05:30.725
Little Harper Adams, she got
her tonsils out last week.

05:30.759 --> 05:32.493
Oh, she's adorable.

05:36.564 --> 05:40.033
Excuse me, hi. You wouldn't happen
to know Warren Nichols, would you?

05:40.068 --> 05:41.836
Let me check.

05:42.771 --> 05:44.972
Mmm... Yep. That's me.

05:45.006 --> 05:46.473
Hello.

05:46.507 --> 05:48.075
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

05:48.109 --> 05:49.610
We're friends with
your sister Stevie.

05:49.644 --> 05:53.114
You guys know my sister
Stevie? Well, where is she?

05:53.148 --> 05:54.982
Is she here with you?
Huh? Stevie!

05:55.017 --> 05:57.251
No, no, no! No, no. No.

05:58.687 --> 06:00.255
She... She didn't
come with us.

06:00.289 --> 06:01.689
She doesn't even know
we're here.

06:01.724 --> 06:03.891
You guys need
to get her back here.

06:03.926 --> 06:06.862
Stevie skipped town when I beat
her in the wizard competition,

06:06.896 --> 06:09.464
right in the middle of the
Transfer of Powers Ceremony.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.866
Is this where that happens?

06:10.900 --> 06:13.201
Oh, no!
Not out here, in here.

06:14.337 --> 06:16.004
That door!

06:22.712 --> 06:25.347
So this is where I'll go
when I win my powers.

06:25.382 --> 06:28.951
Oh! Outlets in the ceiling.
I like it!

06:31.754 --> 06:33.188
So let me
get this straight:

06:33.223 --> 06:35.557
She bailed on you in
the middle of the transfer?

06:35.591 --> 06:36.892
Then that means
you're stuck here

06:36.926 --> 06:38.527
until she gets back
to finish the ceremony.

06:38.561 --> 06:40.462
Yes! She's evil!

06:40.496 --> 06:43.231
- I knew it!
- Wait, wait, wait.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.233
We've heard two
different stories here.

06:45.268 --> 06:47.969
Well, maybe Warren is lying.

06:48.004 --> 06:51.506
Let's see if he can stand up to
one of my uncomfortable stares.

06:55.244 --> 06:56.911
Yep, he's a liar.

06:58.147 --> 07:00.381
Quick! Quick, he fainted.

07:00.415 --> 07:01.649
Someone give me a pen.

07:01.684 --> 07:03.851
I love drawing mustaches
on people who can't stop me.

07:03.886 --> 07:05.987
No, it makes sense.

07:06.021 --> 07:09.090
He won, and a disgruntled family
member's trying to wreck it for him.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.425
I'm seeing my future
in the present.

07:11.493 --> 07:13.161
Stevie is my friend.

07:13.195 --> 07:15.763
I'm sure she has a reasonable
explanation for what's going on.

07:15.798 --> 07:18.032
Everyone is innocent
until proven guilty.

07:18.066 --> 07:19.734
Come on, Harper,
let's go find Stevie.

07:19.768 --> 07:21.469
I bet you he has
a pen on him.

07:23.238 --> 07:25.072
Alex! Stop that.
It looks illegal.

07:34.081 --> 07:37.417
The hour of victory
is near, my followers.

07:37.451 --> 07:40.420
Very soon we'll have
enough wizards signed up

07:40.454 --> 07:44.358
to start the revolution!

07:49.498 --> 07:50.766
It's locked.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.635
The door doesn't even
have a lock.

07:52.669 --> 07:55.037
Someone must have jammed it from
the inside with a broomstick.

07:55.072 --> 07:57.040
No, that doesn't make
much sense

07:57.074 --> 07:58.642
because this is
the only broom here

07:58.676 --> 08:00.177
and it doesn't even
have a handle, so...

08:00.211 --> 08:01.978
Oh, okay,
I'm caught up now.

08:04.916 --> 08:06.717
...their powers again.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.721
If I get enough wizards
who are behind

08:11.756 --> 08:13.456
in their family
wizard competition

08:13.491 --> 08:15.725
to perform a spell
at the same time,

08:15.760 --> 08:21.064
oh, it will melt down the power
distributor in the Hall of Transfers.

08:21.099 --> 08:26.336
Then, no wizard will ever have
to give up their powers again.

08:30.141 --> 08:32.009
Oh! I knew it!

08:32.043 --> 08:33.477
Stevie was using you
for our lair

08:33.510 --> 08:34.845
so she could start
a revolution.

08:34.879 --> 08:36.613
Stevie is evil!

08:36.648 --> 08:41.083
Yeah, I can see how you might
feel right about that.

08:43.621 --> 08:44.788
I'm telling Dad.

08:44.822 --> 08:47.224
How are we gonna tell Dad?
We can't even get in.

08:48.727 --> 08:50.361
Stevie! Stevie!

08:51.763 --> 08:54.565
Stevie, Stevie,
open up the door.

08:54.599 --> 08:57.167
I have something
to tell my father.

08:58.503 --> 09:01.372
Hey, is it true that you
bailed on your brother

09:01.407 --> 09:02.874
in the middle
of the competition?

09:02.908 --> 09:05.443
Did you just see any of that?

09:05.478 --> 09:07.779
Yeah, the whole bit
about the holograms

09:07.813 --> 09:10.216
and the revolution
and the bad stuff, yeah.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.217
But I'm sure you have
a very logical explanation,

09:12.252 --> 09:15.187
so just open the door and
you can explain it to us.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.894
You want an explanation?
Here it is: Warren won.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.129
But I don't want to
give up my powers.

09:24.163 --> 09:28.366
Okay, it's not fair that only one
person gets to keep their powers.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.636
Evil! It's in the eyes!
Look at her! It's evil!

09:32.671 --> 09:34.839
Hey, if my plan works,

09:34.873 --> 09:37.741
there will be no more
wizard competition.

09:37.776 --> 09:40.010
I just need
a few more wizards

09:40.045 --> 09:44.148
who have no chance of winning their
family wizard competition to join me,

09:44.182 --> 09:49.019
so we can keep
our powers forever.

09:49.054 --> 09:51.055
You can forget
about that, Stevie.

09:51.089 --> 09:54.291
You're never gonna convince Alex
to join your stupid revolution.

09:54.325 --> 09:55.959
Right, Alex?

09:59.497 --> 10:00.964
Right, Alex?

10:04.468 --> 10:05.768
Alex!

10:05.802 --> 10:07.503
Well, I gotta admit

10:07.537 --> 10:10.038
it does sound
kind of interesting.

10:10.073 --> 10:11.606
What?!

10:13.475 --> 10:15.576
Fortunado amontillado.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.247
Alex, let us in!

10:20.282 --> 10:23.785
Come on, Alex. The odds of you
beating Justin are very slim.

10:23.819 --> 10:27.489
With my plan, your
powers are guaranteed.

10:30.393 --> 10:31.594
Are you in?

10:35.966 --> 10:37.167
I'm in.

10:43.545 --> 10:45.679
- Seriously, let us in!
- Let us in! Alex!

10:50.018 --> 10:51.585
She's not answering.

10:51.619 --> 10:53.587
I knew Alex was bad,
but not this bad.

10:53.621 --> 10:55.088
I still have
complete faith in her.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.622
She always does
before she thinks

10:56.656 --> 10:58.290
and when she thinks,
she undoes,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.292
and blames it
on somebody else.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.994
But this is serious.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.063
I can't just sit around and
wait for her to change her mind.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.765
I've gotta get in there.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.169
Something's wrong.

11:18.043 --> 11:19.710
Bricks made of plastic!

11:19.745 --> 11:21.812
The natural enemy
of magic.

11:23.314 --> 11:24.982
What are we gonna do now?

11:26.217 --> 11:28.619
You wanna kiss a little bit?

11:33.592 --> 11:34.559
Come again?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.928
You know,
a little smoochy-smooch.

11:36.962 --> 11:39.263
I won't tell anyone.

11:39.297 --> 11:41.165
Alex is about to join
a revolution

11:41.199 --> 11:43.467
to overtake the entire
wizard world,

11:43.501 --> 11:45.569
and you're asking me to kiss?

11:45.603 --> 11:47.437
Sure.

11:51.341 --> 11:54.409
I mean, we all know she's gonna do
the right thing in the end anyway.

11:54.443 --> 11:56.444
I don't think so.

12:05.152 --> 12:09.222
Yes, hello, I'd like a
delivery to this wand location.

12:09.256 --> 12:11.290
Terrific. I'd like one
order of Kung Pao dragon

12:11.324 --> 12:13.559
and make sure to include
fortune cookies.

12:13.593 --> 12:15.227
Thank you.

12:15.261 --> 12:17.362
Yes, you have
a good day. Okay.

12:19.230 --> 12:20.997
You're ordering
Chinese food?

12:21.032 --> 12:23.566
Wizard fortune cookies give
you a glimpse into the future

12:23.601 --> 12:26.168
and I'm gonna show you
that Alex is evil.

12:26.202 --> 12:28.169
Now look,

12:28.204 --> 12:30.571
I'm gonna tell people
we kissed anyway.

12:30.606 --> 12:31.972
So don't make me a liar.

12:32.007 --> 12:33.907
Let's just kiss
a little bit.

12:37.245 --> 12:38.979
It's real... No!

12:48.290 --> 12:50.658
Wow, you got a lot of
people onboard, Stevie.

12:50.692 --> 12:52.860
I think this plan
can actually work.

12:52.894 --> 12:57.197
I knew when we met that you would
want to keep your powers, like me.

12:57.232 --> 12:58.866
And I knew
there was something

12:58.900 --> 13:01.367
I liked about you,
but this?

13:01.401 --> 13:03.001
This is genius.

13:03.035 --> 13:05.670
You are my new role model.

13:05.704 --> 13:07.571
Please, Alex.

13:07.606 --> 13:11.341
I'm sure this is something you would
have eventually come up with yourself.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.775
Yeah, no, that's true,
I take it back.

13:12.809 --> 13:14.476
I'm my own
role model again.

13:15.478 --> 13:17.012
Now...

13:17.046 --> 13:20.482
...we just need to find
one more wizard,

13:20.550 --> 13:24.353
and we'll have enough power
to overload the distributor.

13:24.387 --> 13:28.191
If only there was somebody who
we could totally manipulate.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.759
Hello, Laverne.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.864
Oh, what are you guys
doing in here?

13:34.898 --> 13:36.299
Nothing, Max.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.337
Your sister and I
are planning something

13:41.371 --> 13:43.773
I think you may be
interested in:

13:43.807 --> 13:46.409
a wizard revolution.

13:46.443 --> 13:49.546
I don't know about that.
Spinning makes me throw up.

13:50.915 --> 13:52.782
We're talking about
doing something

13:52.816 --> 13:55.451
that could let us keep
our powers forever.

13:55.485 --> 13:58.587
We just need one more
wizard to help.

13:58.622 --> 14:01.524
Powers and forever,
two of my favorite words.

14:01.558 --> 14:03.793
But "pie" and "filankee"
are still up there.

14:03.827 --> 14:06.128
Yeah, yeah, I know
"filankee" is not a word,

14:06.162 --> 14:08.196
but it's gonna catch on.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.867
Just be ready to cast a spell
when we tell you to.

14:12.902 --> 14:14.869
All right, yeah,
I'm in.

14:14.904 --> 14:17.574
Under one condition:
after the revolution,

14:17.609 --> 14:19.743
you guys make me king
of the wizard world,

14:19.777 --> 14:22.479
where I will eliminate
spinning forever.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.414
- What?!
- Just play along.

14:24.449 --> 14:26.216
You know,
you got it, Max.

14:26.251 --> 14:28.419
You got it. Why don't
you go upstairs and,

14:28.453 --> 14:30.721
make a list of all the things
you want as king.

14:30.756 --> 14:32.923
Sweet! Thanks, guys.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.801
Thank you.

14:44.770 --> 14:46.338
You're wasting your money,
Justin.

14:46.372 --> 14:49.007
You're gonna see that Alex
sometimes goes down the wrong path

14:49.042 --> 14:51.110
but she always does
the right thing in the end.

14:51.144 --> 14:54.614
Then let's take a little
look at the end, shall we?

14:56.784 --> 14:59.385
You can't stand up
against 5,000 wizards

14:59.419 --> 15:01.119
who want to be
wizards forever.

15:01.153 --> 15:03.622
You're not really gonna
do this, are you, Alex?

15:03.656 --> 15:05.323
Yes, Harper, I am.

15:05.357 --> 15:08.693
I hope that when this is over
we can still be friends.

15:10.062 --> 15:12.130
There. Do you need
any more proof?

15:12.165 --> 15:14.332
I don't believe
in fortune cookies,

15:14.366 --> 15:16.100
except for this one that
I got that said,

15:16.135 --> 15:17.802
"People are talking
behind your back."

15:17.836 --> 15:20.738
And then when I turned around,
they were.

15:22.341 --> 15:24.375
But Alex is gonna come
to her senses, I know it.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.645
That's not a bet
I'm willing to take.

15:26.679 --> 15:28.813
The wizard world
has only one hope,

15:28.848 --> 15:32.216
and his name is
Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo.

15:33.718 --> 15:36.554
We need to get back
to City Hall.

15:36.588 --> 15:38.722
Fine, but I'm taking the
rest of these fortune cookies.

15:38.757 --> 15:40.825
I know at least one of them
shows us kissing.

15:50.768 --> 15:53.637
A car with root beer
kegs for wheels.

15:55.473 --> 15:56.840
What are you writing, Max?

15:56.874 --> 15:58.808
Just a list of demands
for when I become king

15:58.843 --> 16:00.677
after the wizard
revolution.

16:03.446 --> 16:06.348
Oh, I get it. It's for
a creative writing class.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.216
Let me see
what you got so far.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.885
"As king,
I shall be served pudding

16:10.920 --> 16:13.421
for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner."

16:13.455 --> 16:14.789
Jealous yet?

16:15.657 --> 16:16.658
I do that now.

16:24.468 --> 16:27.871
Hey, Alex, I think that you'll
be glad to know as king,

16:27.905 --> 16:31.442
I've decided to let you all
keep your feet.

16:32.678 --> 16:33.811
Thanks, Max.

16:35.213 --> 16:37.882
Hey, Stevie, why don't we go
down to the Hall of Transfers

16:37.916 --> 16:39.750
and get a picture
when it all goes down?

16:39.785 --> 16:41.719
I like the way
you think, Russo.

16:41.754 --> 16:45.389
Max, why don't you come with
us so you can take our picture.

16:45.423 --> 16:48.759
I do love pressing buttons.
Yeah, I'll go.

16:48.794 --> 16:51.595
Carry me to the Hall
of Transfers.

16:53.298 --> 16:55.098
I'm the king.

16:58.302 --> 17:00.471
You know, this would be a lot
more difficult without feet.

17:07.913 --> 17:09.079
Okay, so we're here,

17:09.114 --> 17:11.848
and there's one very
important thing missing: Alex.

17:11.884 --> 17:14.117
This looks nothing like
your stupid fortune cookie.

17:16.755 --> 17:19.891
Now that looks something like
your stupid fortune cookie.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.893
Harper, Justin,
what are you guys doing here?

17:21.926 --> 17:23.394
You're not supposed to be here.

17:23.428 --> 17:25.463
Yeah. You guys are supposed
to be building my king chair.

17:25.498 --> 17:27.765
If you're not gonna use those
arms you're gonna lose 'em.

17:27.799 --> 17:30.267
You're not gonna
get away with this.

17:30.301 --> 17:32.136
I mean, I might miss it
'cause I fainted

17:32.170 --> 17:34.572
but you're not gonna
get away with this.

17:34.606 --> 17:36.741
Hello, Warren.

17:36.776 --> 17:38.910
Long time, no see.

17:38.944 --> 17:41.813
And we are going
to get away with this.

17:41.847 --> 17:44.683
You can't stand up
against 5,000 wizards

17:44.718 --> 17:46.485
who want to be wizards
forever.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.589
You can forget about your
stupid revolution, Stevie,

17:49.623 --> 17:52.493
because we've thought of
something that you'll never defeat.

17:52.527 --> 17:55.296
Say hello to our little
surge protector!

17:56.932 --> 17:59.266
Hello, surge protector.

18:01.169 --> 18:03.438
Goodbye,
surge protector.

18:05.941 --> 18:08.677
I always forget about
other people with wands.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.015
Alex, you're not really
gonna do this, are you?

18:13.049 --> 18:15.417
Yes, Harper, I am.

18:15.452 --> 18:17.953
I hope that when this is over
we can still be friends.

18:20.023 --> 18:22.123
Stevie, let me get a picture
of you next to the power source.

18:22.158 --> 18:23.992
We can use that to make
our revolution flag.

18:24.927 --> 18:26.527
Max, will you take our picture?

18:26.561 --> 18:28.228
Count to three and press
this button right here.

18:28.263 --> 18:29.830
Now that's one
fun-looking button.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.534
Come on, there's gotta be
something we could do.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.538
I know! Let's tilt
this thing over.

18:38.572 --> 18:40.273
- Yeah. Okay.
- Come on.

18:45.479 --> 18:47.413
Darn these
smooth-soled shoes!

18:48.816 --> 18:50.416
Keep this away
from your sister.

18:50.451 --> 18:52.685
But... What, a pen?

18:56.691 --> 18:58.825
All right. One, two...

18:58.860 --> 19:00.694
Wait! Wait, wait, okay.

19:00.728 --> 19:03.631
Okay, Stevie, put your hand
on the power source

19:03.665 --> 19:05.900
as if you were about
to give up your powers.

19:05.934 --> 19:08.703
Hilarious.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.708
Say cheese! And...

19:17.580 --> 19:20.115
Quick! Now I've gotta
hit the transfer button.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.318
This is worse than I thought! Alex froze Stevie
so she can take all the powers for herself.

19:23.353 --> 19:25.988
- Justin!
- Oh, my gosh, I get it now.

19:26.022 --> 19:28.724
Our sister is truly evil.

19:28.758 --> 19:31.394
And it's not just
fun evil, it's evil evil.

19:31.428 --> 19:34.230
Dad said if this ever happens we
should run and change our names.

19:34.265 --> 19:36.399
Run, Giuseppe, run!

19:38.068 --> 19:40.770
No! We have to stop Alex
from pressing the button.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.738
You guys don't get it.
She froze Stevie

19:42.772 --> 19:44.873
so Warren could get his
full powers. She's on our side.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.141
- Finally.
- Harper!

19:46.175 --> 19:47.809
She just disobeyed the king!

19:47.843 --> 19:50.144
I said no button pushing.
Give me your feet.

19:51.547 --> 19:54.649
Power transfer complete.

20:00.424 --> 20:02.258
I'm a full wizard!

20:02.292 --> 20:04.894
This is everything
that I ever wanted,

20:04.929 --> 20:06.763
plus a visor!

20:10.569 --> 20:12.303
Alex, what
changed your mind?

20:12.337 --> 20:14.204
Nothing changed my mind.

20:14.239 --> 20:17.574
I set this whole thing up from the
moment I realized that Stevie was evil.

20:17.608 --> 20:19.109
I knew it!

20:21.012 --> 20:24.481
Just as I planned,
another Russo victory.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.449
- Yes.
- Hold on.

20:26.483 --> 20:28.250
You can't claim
Russo victory.

20:28.285 --> 20:30.920
You thought I was actually gonna
go through with this. How dare you!

20:30.987 --> 20:32.854
And you!

20:32.889 --> 20:34.990
How dare you think
I'd make you king.

20:35.024 --> 20:36.625
I'm not king?

20:37.693 --> 20:39.094
Aw, man!

20:40.162 --> 20:42.796
Only Harper eventually
figured it out.

20:42.830 --> 20:45.131
No, I believed in you
the whole time.

20:45.166 --> 20:47.033
Seriously?

20:47.067 --> 20:49.670
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

20:53.141 --> 20:55.743
See? This just proves
my theory.

20:55.777 --> 20:58.747
People outside of the
Russos are better.

21:01.251 --> 21:04.553
Ow! She's so cold.

21:13.797 --> 21:18.234
Oh! Now that's a nice
brother/sister moment.

21:18.268 --> 21:20.236
We should go celebrate
at the Wizard County Fair.

21:20.270 --> 21:22.638
- Yeah, I'll drive.
- Oh, sorry.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.173
It's Only People Who
Believed in Alex Day.

21:25.207 --> 21:26.374
Come on, Harper.

21:30.713 --> 21:34.148
Well, I guess there's
only one thing left to do:

21:34.182 --> 21:36.550
draw a mustache on him.

21:39.321 --> 21:41.389
I told him I wouldn't
give it to Alex.

21:47.405 --> 21:50.441
Sorry things didn't work out
with you and your friend.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.709
Oh, that's okay.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.178
Sometimes people aren't
who they seem to be,

21:54.212 --> 21:56.280
but I'll always
have my Harper.

21:56.614 --> 21:57.878
Yeah.

21:58.079 --> 22:01.979
And sometimes things are
exactly what they seem to be.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.947
Like a bearded lady.

22:07.352 --> 22:11.388
I got me some
pudding for dinner.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.058
Are you jealous?

22:17.228 --> 22:19.997
A bearded lady?
Oh, man!

22:21.199 --> 22:22.366
Trade ya.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.234
Take a walk, pudding face.
