01:51.751 --> 01:53.784
Heil Hitler.

03:49.001 --> 03:50.605
<i>Guten tag.</i>

03:52.039 --> 03:53.940
<i>Danke, Fraulein.</i>

04:47.227 --> 04:48.692
How you doing, Barr?

04:48.694 --> 04:50.862
Not too bad, George.
Yourself?

04:50.864 --> 04:53.098
Ah, same old, same old.

04:55.669 --> 04:57.101
Feeling okay?

04:57.103 --> 04:59.271
Haven't seen you look up
from your drink all night.

04:59.273 --> 05:03.007
Well, just...
thinking about some things.

05:03.009 --> 05:05.078
- Just thinking.
- Mm. About?

05:05.912 --> 05:08.583
Nothing important, really.

05:09.016 --> 05:11.249
You know what?
A vacation.

05:11.251 --> 05:13.617
You need to get down to Florida.

05:13.619 --> 05:15.956
The Keys, Barr.
Do you golf?

05:16.790 --> 05:18.256
Uh, Hawaii, maybe.

05:18.258 --> 05:20.992
You... You ever fished
a deep sea?

05:20.994 --> 05:23.295
You know, go somewhere warm
where you can spend

05:23.297 --> 05:26.264
some of your hard-earned money
and relax.

05:26.266 --> 05:28.934
The Keys, Barr.
Think of it.

05:28.936 --> 05:30.668
Do you golf?

05:30.670 --> 05:32.269
Those sound like
the kind of places

05:32.271 --> 05:35.807
where a man such as yourself
might think a man such as myself

05:35.809 --> 05:38.343
might go off happily to die,
George.

05:38.345 --> 05:40.612
Am I right?

05:40.614 --> 05:43.581
Look, I didn't mean any offense,
Barr, honest.

05:43.583 --> 05:46.216
- I'm just saying you might...
- I'm not offended, George.

05:46.218 --> 05:47.952
You're right.

05:47.954 --> 05:49.754
I should be rounding out
my life

05:49.756 --> 05:52.223
with a fishing pole and a tan,

05:52.225 --> 05:55.593
not sitting on some wobbly stool
with cheap drinks

05:55.595 --> 05:57.661
in a crummy bar.

05:57.663 --> 05:59.766
No offense, George.

06:02.069 --> 06:04.605
Don't pay any attention to me.

06:05.004 --> 06:06.908
It's the drink.

06:07.807 --> 06:10.110
I think I'll give it up today.

06:11.345 --> 06:14.379
Honestly.
What do you think?

06:18.285 --> 06:21.054
Good night, George.
Take care.

06:21.821 --> 06:23.922
See you tomorrow, Calvin?

06:23.924 --> 06:26.257
See you tomorrow, George.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.367
There it is.

07:21.915 --> 07:23.117
Hm.

07:37.396 --> 07:39.399
Change, mister?

07:40.066 --> 07:41.968
Got any change?

07:42.436 --> 07:44.334
Yeah.

07:44.336 --> 07:46.136
Just don't, uh...

07:47.874 --> 07:49.977
...don't spend it all on...

07:52.746 --> 07:53.981
Ah, forget it.

07:57.117 --> 07:58.686
Thank you.

08:20.874 --> 08:22.777
Wallet.
Keys.

08:29.182 --> 08:33.051
I just gave the last of my money
to a... bum,

08:33.053 --> 08:34.318
a man who...

08:35.520 --> 08:37.154
Did I say to talk?

08:37.155 --> 08:39.392
Wallet. Now.

08:40.359 --> 08:42.128
Give me that.

08:43.764 --> 08:46.801
Oh.
Is... Is this what you wanted?

08:47.233 --> 08:48.703
She's pretty.

08:55.342 --> 08:56.376
Move.

09:05.117 --> 09:06.484
Let's go.

09:08.288 --> 09:09.888
I can't just let you...

09:12.391 --> 09:14.993
I need my car.

09:14.995 --> 09:16.497
Get out of here, old man.

09:21.168 --> 09:22.203
You're dead.

09:37.349 --> 09:39.352
For Pete's sake.

11:50.416 --> 11:52.082
Cripes.

13:20.540 --> 13:24.142
You've traveled a long way,
Mr. America.

13:24.144 --> 13:25.980
And on foot.

13:27.146 --> 13:29.279
Do they hurt?

13:29.281 --> 13:30.316
<i>Nyet.</i>

13:32.484 --> 13:34.184
You must not humor me.

13:34.186 --> 13:36.120
I know you speak Russian.

13:36.122 --> 13:37.822
You speak German.

13:37.824 --> 13:40.124
You speak French.

13:40.126 --> 13:44.298
How many other languages
you do <i>not</i> speak?

13:45.131 --> 13:46.632
Not many.

13:50.536 --> 13:51.735
Bad tobacco.

13:53.705 --> 13:58.109
And how come you've learned
so many foreign tongues?

13:58.111 --> 13:59.777
I don't know.

13:59.779 --> 14:02.547
It comes naturally.
They're just words.

14:02.549 --> 14:03.847
Of course.

14:03.849 --> 14:06.552
So many things come naturally
to you.

14:08.454 --> 14:10.587
Can you paint?

14:13.193 --> 14:15.496
Do you think I can paint?

14:16.128 --> 14:22.035
I see... artistic love
in your eyes.

14:22.868 --> 14:25.138
I think maybe you can paint.

14:26.171 --> 14:30.676
But we need to get rid
of that... beard you're wearing.

14:31.544 --> 14:33.778
I've had a long journey
to get here.

14:33.780 --> 14:36.313
And in such secrecy.

14:36.315 --> 14:40.586
Mr. America,
the lonesome wanderer.

14:41.286 --> 14:47.325
I wish I knew what is it that
we're helping you to accomplish.

14:47.327 --> 14:49.460
It's not important.

14:49.462 --> 14:51.398
America thanks you.

14:56.136 --> 14:57.170
Do you?

14:57.636 --> 14:59.169
What?

15:00.740 --> 15:02.309
Thank me.

15:02.775 --> 15:05.176
I'm not America.

15:05.178 --> 15:06.777
I'm just a mission.

15:06.779 --> 15:10.250
You... are a human being.

15:10.617 --> 15:13.551
And you might want to say
thank you if you like.

15:13.553 --> 15:15.586
And I might say,
"You're welcome,"

15:15.588 --> 15:17.723
and we'll have some drink.

15:18.925 --> 15:21.094
It will be very cordial.

15:22.328 --> 15:27.230
My mother was the daughter
of Romanian Gypsies,

15:27.232 --> 15:31.936
and she believed in the power
of a straight-edge razor.

15:31.938 --> 15:35.175
She believed that it can tell
the future.

15:36.809 --> 15:39.313
May I give you this shave?

15:46.419 --> 15:47.618
You may.

15:47.620 --> 15:51.254
Now, a shave can be just that...
a shave.

15:51.256 --> 15:53.323
Nothing more, nothing less.

15:53.325 --> 15:57.861
But once we announce
that this is a special shave,

15:57.863 --> 16:00.766
that we're seeking omens...

16:01.400 --> 16:04.271
...then there is no way back.

16:08.507 --> 16:14.614
Hereby... I announce...
the specialness.

16:20.285 --> 16:23.790
The shave cannot be perfect.
Only God is perfect.

16:24.824 --> 16:27.828
If it's perfect
and I don't cut you...

16:29.795 --> 16:35.368
...then... you'll fail,
and you'll die.

16:36.602 --> 16:41.742
But if I make a mistake
and I draw blood, then...

16:43.575 --> 16:46.179
....you will succeed
and you'll live.

16:48.348 --> 16:53.817
But I cannot <i>try</i>
to make a mistake

16:53.819 --> 16:57.888
to influence or sway
the final outcome

16:57.890 --> 17:01.295
or we both will be cursed.

17:03.029 --> 17:07.768
I must try... to be honest
in each stroke.

17:09.601 --> 17:14.640
I must try...
to have steady hands.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.040
And only if I make
an accidental...

17:18.042 --> 17:21.877
absolutely accidental mistake...
if my hand shakes,

17:21.880 --> 17:23.748
if I look aside for a moment

17:23.750 --> 17:28.922
of if the razor catches your
skin in some innocent way...

17:30.656 --> 17:33.024
...then the blood
is a good omen.

17:33.026 --> 17:35.362
The blood is life.

17:36.828 --> 17:41.635
But I must... try to be perfect.

17:42.034 --> 17:46.272
And my hands must be
very steady.

17:46.638 --> 17:51.675
And you... must try not to move.

17:51.677 --> 17:57.950
Don't you move, Mr. America,
or you'll curse yourself.

18:07.026 --> 18:08.495
It's perfect.

18:11.431 --> 18:13.767
My hands are steady today.

18:15.534 --> 18:19.872
And the omen is that...
you will fail.

18:20.906 --> 18:22.775
And you will die.

18:32.484 --> 18:35.621
Put this on your face.
It will feel very nice.

18:36.923 --> 18:40.327
You will succeed
in your mission, Mr. America.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.994
Nevertheless... we are cursed.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.469
Now, we'll bring you
to where you need to be.

18:51.471 --> 18:57.477
And beyond that, you venture
alone into an unholy land.

18:58.677 --> 19:00.744
I thank you.

19:00.746 --> 19:02.813
You're welcome.

19:02.815 --> 19:04.351
Now we can drink.

19:05.550 --> 19:06.616
What is it?

19:06.618 --> 19:08.786
It's not vodka.

19:08.788 --> 19:13.559
You would expect a Russian
to drink vodka, wouldn't you?

19:14.092 --> 19:16.093
That's typical.

19:16.095 --> 19:18.095
But I don't know you.

19:18.097 --> 19:21.632
I mustn't do
what you expect me to do.

19:21.634 --> 19:24.570
We might be enemies one day.

19:25.171 --> 19:28.005
You might think you knew me.

19:28.007 --> 19:31.107
This.
We drink gin.

19:36.848 --> 19:38.449
Russian, that is not gin.

19:39.819 --> 19:41.521
It is vodka.

19:44.857 --> 19:47.126
You might think you knew me.

20:12.518 --> 20:14.054
Good boy.

20:49.588 --> 20:51.657
For Pete's sake.

21:11.610 --> 21:13.746
I'll be back, buddy.

21:14.813 --> 21:16.048
You want to come?

21:19.684 --> 21:21.085
All right.

21:21.087 --> 21:22.920
Let's go.

21:24.656 --> 21:26.524
Come on.

21:26.526 --> 21:28.625
This guy's up
there killing people, you know?

21:28.627 --> 21:31.228
Hikers and stuff, leaving big,
phony-looking footprints

21:31.230 --> 21:33.564
for the authorities to find,
and it's sick.

21:33.566 --> 21:36.299
When they find this wacko, send
him down here into the States.

21:36.301 --> 21:38.838
I'll show him a big foot...
right up his...

21:39.204 --> 21:41.675
Terrible stuff, Ralph.

21:42.241 --> 21:45.811
That's all we know,
and we eat it up.

21:48.047 --> 21:50.684
But you're a good boy, though,
right?

21:51.817 --> 21:53.653
I think so.

23:21.072 --> 23:22.172
Hi there.

23:22.174 --> 23:23.707
Hi.

23:23.709 --> 23:26.012
Oh, that's right.
Let me just get, um...

23:26.646 --> 23:31.117
Can I, uh...
help you with anything?

23:31.716 --> 23:34.020
I'm looking for a hat.

24:03.816 --> 24:05.085
Huh.

24:18.297 --> 24:21.131
Do you sell this kind
of lottery ticket here?

24:21.133 --> 24:23.032
Scratch ticket.
Yeah.

24:23.034 --> 24:26.138
Well, would you say this one
came from here, then?

24:27.173 --> 24:28.771
Did you buy it here?

24:28.773 --> 24:30.807
No, I found it.

24:30.809 --> 24:33.911
Appears to be a winner... $100.

24:33.913 --> 24:35.045
Okay.

24:35.047 --> 24:37.448
You want your winnings, then?

24:37.450 --> 24:39.348
No.
It's not mine.

24:39.350 --> 24:41.285
So what do you want to do
with it?

24:41.287 --> 24:43.953
Get it back to its rightful
owner or what have you.

24:43.955 --> 24:46.457
Whoever bought it just didn't
look it over good enough

24:46.459 --> 24:49.159
and probably threw it out when
they thought it was a loser.

24:49.161 --> 24:50.728
That happens?

24:50.730 --> 24:51.862
That happens.

24:51.864 --> 24:53.800
- Often?
- It happens.

24:54.265 --> 24:55.734
Pretty foolish.

24:57.770 --> 25:00.040
I think I'll just leave it here.

25:01.507 --> 25:03.307
You don't want the winnings?

25:03.309 --> 25:05.244
I got nothing to do with it.

25:05.877 --> 25:07.411
Keep it handy
for a couple of days.

25:07.413 --> 25:11.818
If no one shows to collect
the winnings, you keep it.

25:13.184 --> 25:14.753
Here.

25:15.253 --> 25:16.420
For your dog.

25:16.422 --> 25:18.024
Thank you.

25:18.991 --> 25:21.895
I'd just as soon pay for it
myself.

25:23.061 --> 25:25.028
Lets the dog know
I'm thinking of him.

25:26.132 --> 25:27.396
Huh.

25:27.398 --> 25:29.399
I wonder how this one
never got caught

25:29.401 --> 25:31.434
to be burned or what have you.

25:31.436 --> 25:32.935
Who's burning money?

25:32.937 --> 25:35.005
The government.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.840
They destroy the old ones
every so often

25:37.842 --> 25:41.010
so that new, crisp legal tenders
can be printed up

25:41.012 --> 25:43.480
and put out into circulation.

25:43.482 --> 25:46.215
I was wondering how this one
never got caught

25:46.217 --> 25:48.018
to be burned or what have you.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.419
I don't know.

25:49.421 --> 25:52.292
Some old ones just hang around.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.833
Hi there, Ed.

26:06.571 --> 26:09.074
Did you get a haircut
somewhere else?

26:09.508 --> 26:12.509
Yeah.
A couple of weeks ago.

26:12.511 --> 26:14.510
Feels a little heavy.

26:14.512 --> 26:16.249
Well, come on in, then.

26:19.050 --> 26:21.120
It's been a while.

26:24.522 --> 26:28.991
Well... it was growing real slow
for a while there.

26:28.993 --> 26:31.828
Then, all of a sudden, it just
started growing real fast,

26:31.830 --> 26:35.298
so... here I am.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.303
That's one of the better
problems I've ever heard of.

26:40.505 --> 26:43.105
The numbers are backward
in real life

26:43.107 --> 26:46.445
and... normal in the mirror.

26:47.245 --> 26:49.512
A mirror clock.

26:49.514 --> 26:51.280
Huh.

26:51.282 --> 26:54.017
So, how have you been?
You look a little tired.

26:54.019 --> 26:55.919
Yeah.

26:55.921 --> 26:57.957
Oh, I'm fine.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.227
You sure?

27:01.993 --> 27:05.194
Yeah.
I'm just...

27:05.196 --> 27:07.230
just...

27:09.568 --> 27:12.336
Don't... Don't jerk your head
like that.

27:12.338 --> 27:14.637
Otherwise I might take part
of your ear off.

27:17.076 --> 27:18.875
You can talk to me.

27:18.877 --> 27:20.877
What's bothering you?

27:20.879 --> 27:23.346
Nothing, Ed.
I'm... I'm fine.

27:23.348 --> 27:25.249
I'm just...

27:25.251 --> 27:26.552
Nothing.

27:29.888 --> 27:31.456
I don't know.

27:32.558 --> 27:36.128
I feel... old.

27:37.262 --> 27:40.532
I know... I am.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.403
There's other things.

27:45.169 --> 27:47.606
Things I could have done
differently.

27:49.308 --> 27:51.144
Regrets.

27:52.144 --> 27:55.077
It's all just nonsense, Ed.

27:55.079 --> 27:56.413
Selfish.

27:56.415 --> 27:57.983
Nothing.

27:59.652 --> 28:03.386
We don't talk as often
as we should.

28:03.388 --> 28:05.454
And I get that.
I know why.

28:05.456 --> 28:06.959
I'm your little brother.

28:09.127 --> 28:11.297
- We should go fishing.
- Huh.

28:16.100 --> 28:19.504
No.
I shot someone during the war.

28:24.242 --> 28:26.279
I never wanted that.

28:27.312 --> 28:29.214
To kill a man.

28:31.215 --> 28:33.386
Even if he had it coming.

28:35.620 --> 28:37.386
And he did.

29:35.713 --> 29:39.385
<i>Do svidaniya,</i> Mr. America.

32:15.807 --> 32:17.406
<i>Sitz!</i>

32:24.515 --> 32:25.650
<i>Hier.</i>

33:03.288 --> 33:04.757
Heil Hitler.

33:37.888 --> 33:39.891
<i>Mein Fuehrer.</i>

35:02.740 --> 35:04.009
Come on.

35:46.852 --> 35:48.054
Hm.

36:42.573 --> 36:43.740
Thank you.

36:43.742 --> 36:45.475
Yeah.

36:45.477 --> 36:50.616
Figured it was high time
we had a real... you know, date.

36:51.182 --> 36:53.917
We have, don't you think?

36:53.919 --> 36:59.122
Not like a hamburger at Gus's
or... a walk around town.

36:59.124 --> 37:02.528
I mean like a... you know...

37:02.961 --> 37:05.131
It's wonderful, Calvin.
Thank you.

37:06.698 --> 37:08.033
Sure.

37:11.602 --> 37:13.937
Didn't expect to end up
someplace like this

37:13.939 --> 37:16.538
when I left class today.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.207
If the kids could only see me.

37:18.209 --> 37:19.975
They would laugh at me.

37:19.977 --> 37:23.879
You look... awfully fine to me.

37:26.818 --> 37:28.750
I'm happy, Calvin.

37:28.752 --> 37:29.886
Thank you.

37:29.888 --> 37:32.024
Yeah. Sure.
You bet.

37:34.493 --> 37:37.826
Only, uh, I wish that, uh...

37:37.828 --> 37:39.629
- Yes?
- What I mean to say...

37:40.731 --> 37:42.832
Hey, move your table, pal.

37:42.834 --> 37:44.636
It's in the way of everything.

37:53.278 --> 37:55.879
You were saying you...
you wish...

37:57.582 --> 38:00.582
You see, I'm... I'm...
I'm happy, and... and, um...

38:00.584 --> 38:04.053
hopefully you're...
you know, with me, too.

38:04.055 --> 38:05.888
So... And...
And when you're not around,

38:05.890 --> 38:08.024
I-I'm... I'm, um...

38:08.026 --> 38:10.192
Oh, cripes.
What am I trying to say here?

38:10.194 --> 38:12.932
Uh...

38:14.098 --> 38:17.200
When I get back...
I think we should get...

38:17.202 --> 38:18.968
Look who it is!

38:18.970 --> 38:20.669
Oh. Um...

38:20.671 --> 38:23.540
You're Harold's teacher.

38:23.542 --> 38:24.941
Harold is tickled pink

38:24.943 --> 38:27.109
that he has a teacher
who understands his pace.

38:27.111 --> 38:28.845
And darned
if he didn't tell me.

38:28.847 --> 38:30.812
Takes an interest
in model trains.

38:30.814 --> 38:33.716
Well, my father was an engineer,
so, you know, it just...

38:33.718 --> 38:35.852
Harold tells me that you never
rush through math lessons

38:35.854 --> 38:37.620
and you always take the time
to explain

38:37.622 --> 38:42.591
this plus that equals this
using apples instead of numbers.

38:42.593 --> 38:44.294
Apples instead of numbers!

38:44.296 --> 38:46.930
They're still numbers,
but apples help the children...

38:46.932 --> 38:48.665
He's a big eater.
Loves food.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.633
Not apples so much.

38:50.635 --> 38:51.901
Well, maybe as numbers.

38:51.903 --> 38:53.236
We were going to send him

38:53.238 --> 38:54.870
to a private school,
but then we thought,

38:54.872 --> 38:57.573
how would he truly get to know
regular folks

38:57.575 --> 38:59.274
if he didn't, you know,
live down among them

38:59.276 --> 39:01.176
and mingle for a little while?

39:01.178 --> 39:02.912
Well, it's only the third grade,

39:02.914 --> 39:05.048
so I'm sure there'll be
plenty of time for him to...

39:05.050 --> 39:07.883
Anyway, it has just been an
absolute pleasure to meet you.

39:07.885 --> 39:11.720
And you are twice as lovely
as Harold described you.

39:11.722 --> 39:15.792
And I'd be half a man
not to notice, and I do.

39:15.794 --> 39:16.929
Hm.

39:18.162 --> 39:19.194
Son.

39:19.196 --> 39:20.964
Oh, uh, please.
Sorry.

39:20.966 --> 39:24.299
Um, this is Calvin, my, um...

39:24.301 --> 39:27.770
Uh, he's leaving for the service
at the end of the week.

39:27.772 --> 39:29.875
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Calvin.
- Barr.

39:30.374 --> 39:31.774
Good man, Barr.

39:31.776 --> 39:33.142
Don't get shot.

39:40.218 --> 39:41.950
I'm sorry.

39:41.952 --> 39:44.153
Calvin.

39:44.155 --> 39:47.225
Please.
Uh, you were saying.

39:50.127 --> 39:52.895
I-I got the shakes.

39:52.897 --> 39:55.631
Just... Just from the pace
of... of...

39:55.633 --> 39:58.133
Parents get awfully worked up
over their children.

39:58.135 --> 39:59.737
I don't know how you do it.

40:01.039 --> 40:04.640
Dealing with people and...
and... and kids.

40:04.642 --> 40:05.711
You...

40:07.979 --> 40:10.883
You're a saint.
You know that?

40:13.885 --> 40:16.155
What's higher than a saint?

40:17.222 --> 40:19.087
I don't know.

40:19.089 --> 40:22.660
Well, whatever it is...

40:23.093 --> 40:25.030
...that's you.

40:28.399 --> 40:30.702
I love you, Calvin.

40:32.903 --> 40:34.739
I love you too.

43:10.227 --> 43:12.097
Who is it, boy?

43:18.336 --> 43:19.602
Yes?

43:19.604 --> 43:21.337
May we come in, Mr. Barr?

43:21.339 --> 43:23.142
We'd like to talk.

43:23.874 --> 43:25.443
Concerning?

43:26.310 --> 43:28.079
May we come in?

43:32.182 --> 43:34.183
We can talk in the dining room.

43:34.185 --> 43:35.383
I'll make coffee.

43:35.385 --> 43:37.587
Oh, we've already eaten.

43:37.589 --> 43:40.957
I didn't offer you a snack.
I offered you coffee.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.097
Please sit, gentlemen.

43:47.265 --> 43:48.967
That's a good dog.

43:54.104 --> 43:56.175
It'll be ready in a minute.

43:59.510 --> 44:02.113
Cut to the chase, gentlemen.

44:02.546 --> 44:05.247
You've heard about the killings
up north?

44:05.249 --> 44:06.616
It's in the news.

44:06.618 --> 44:07.984
So you've heard, then.

44:07.986 --> 44:10.151
What's the FBI have to do
with it?

44:10.153 --> 44:11.419
We're assisting.

44:11.421 --> 44:13.089
What brings you here?

44:13.091 --> 44:14.490
Monsieur Barr,

44:14.492 --> 44:17.093
with regards to the situation
in Canada,

44:17.095 --> 44:18.895
you are privy to the, um...

44:18.897 --> 44:20.897
Cover story.

44:20.899 --> 44:23.566
The media ran with their angle,
and so we played along.

44:23.568 --> 44:26.334
Sometimes the best way to hide
something is right out in the...

44:26.336 --> 44:27.403
I understand how it works.

44:27.405 --> 44:29.537
No, I don't think you do.

44:29.539 --> 44:30.942
Not yet you don't.

44:31.376 --> 44:33.642
Gentlemen, you are talking
in circles.

44:33.644 --> 44:35.413
Speak here.

44:37.147 --> 44:39.117
My grandfather knew you, Barr.

44:39.550 --> 44:42.084
He was pretty high up
in Army brass.

44:42.086 --> 44:45.421
He used to sit me up on his knee
some nights and tell me stories.

44:45.423 --> 44:48.290
Some I believed.
Others, I don't know.

44:48.292 --> 44:50.692
As he got older,
the stories got stranger.

44:50.694 --> 44:54.600
Family said he got
a little senile in his old age.

44:55.633 --> 44:57.633
I'm not so sure.

44:57.635 --> 45:01.102
In any event,
one story led to another,

45:01.104 --> 45:04.173
and he started telling
about things that, uh...

45:04.175 --> 45:06.278
maybe he wasn't supposed to.

45:06.944 --> 45:11.680
So he sat me up one night
when I was 10, 'back in '55,

45:11.682 --> 45:16.352
and he told me
all about this one soldier.

45:16.354 --> 45:18.254
But he wasn't describing a man.

45:18.256 --> 45:21.624
It was more like something
mythic.

45:21.626 --> 45:25.062
Legendary, like Arthur
or something.

45:26.030 --> 45:29.033
You didn't pull any swords
from any stones, did you?

45:30.600 --> 45:33.301
But you might have done
something.

45:33.303 --> 45:35.136
Something bigger, maybe.

45:35.138 --> 45:37.540
I think your family
had him pegged.

45:37.542 --> 45:39.441
Senility?
Sure.

45:39.443 --> 45:41.045
Maybe.

45:41.446 --> 45:43.315
Then again, I don't know.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.214
Maybe not.

45:45.216 --> 45:48.316
Uh, we were advised
to come and see you,

45:48.318 --> 45:52.455
that, uh, you have, uh, some
skill in tracking, that, uh...

45:52.457 --> 45:57.362
As you probably know...
that was some time past.

45:58.363 --> 46:00.629
And as you can see,
I'm an old man now.

46:00.631 --> 46:03.265
Monsieur Barr,
I want to save lives.

46:03.267 --> 46:08.404
If this situation
is not stayed now...

46:08.406 --> 46:12.077
it could mean the very end
of our world as we know it.

46:12.510 --> 46:13.511
What?

46:27.158 --> 46:28.727
What is this?

46:30.361 --> 46:33.662
These look like
bacterial infections.

46:33.664 --> 46:34.529
Plague.

46:34.531 --> 46:36.267
No, Monsieur Barr.

46:37.301 --> 46:39.171
The Bigfoot.

46:56.521 --> 46:58.287
The creature.

46:58.289 --> 47:00.258
It is sick.

47:09.100 --> 47:13.069
Here are 50 miles
of deep Canadian wilderness

47:13.071 --> 47:15.770
where it has, uh,
already wiped out

47:15.772 --> 47:18.441
an entire population
of wildlife.

47:18.443 --> 47:21.276
There is hardly a-a living
creature within this tract

47:21.278 --> 47:22.747
except for one.

47:23.414 --> 47:25.147
The beast with many names.

47:25.149 --> 47:27.616
Imagine all our worst fears
about influenza...

47:27.618 --> 47:30.618
in humans, bovine, swine...
all of it...

47:30.620 --> 47:33.191
coming true to life, only worse.

47:34.091 --> 47:38.593
That thing is the original
carrier of the nightmare plague.

47:38.595 --> 47:41.229
Thing vanished.
Virus mutated.

47:41.231 --> 47:43.866
Started jumping species
to species.

47:43.868 --> 47:46.669
Stroke of luck it didn't go
to the birds.

47:46.671 --> 47:50.538
Then people started
getting sick, dying... fast,

47:50.540 --> 47:53.109
more than the press
is reporting.

47:53.111 --> 47:56.345
This area is referred to
as the dead zone.

47:56.347 --> 47:58.546
With a virus like this,

47:58.548 --> 48:01.316
a containment breach
is out of the question.

48:01.318 --> 48:04.386
We have tested your blood,
Calvin.

48:04.388 --> 48:07.388
You are immune to the virus.

48:07.390 --> 48:08.656
How?

48:08.658 --> 48:11.660
With, uh,
any strain of influenza,

48:11.662 --> 48:14.462
there is a small percentage
of the population that will...

48:14.464 --> 48:16.767
How did you get my blood?

48:17.435 --> 48:20.903
Your government had some
in refrigeration.

48:20.905 --> 48:22.107
Why?

48:24.475 --> 48:27.142
Speaking from a strictly
scientific standpoint,

48:27.144 --> 48:29.380
y-you are unique, Monsieur Barr.

48:29.881 --> 48:33.515
If there are others, why me?

48:33.517 --> 48:37.185
Some are dead. Some are old.
Some are children.

48:37.187 --> 48:39.421
There are only three
that can help us,

48:39.423 --> 48:40.890
and only you remain.

48:40.892 --> 48:43.191
We sent some of our best men in.

48:43.193 --> 48:44.792
Those who didn't come back
empty-handed

48:44.794 --> 48:46.629
didn't come back at all.

48:46.631 --> 48:50.799
Any hope of a vaccine
would take weeks, months.

48:50.801 --> 48:52.567
If we cannot contain the beast,

48:52.569 --> 48:55.673
if we cannot destroy it
and if it escapes...

48:57.675 --> 49:00.412
...this could truly be the end,
Calvin.

49:00.845 --> 49:05.281
And what if it's already slipped
through this 50-mile tract?

49:05.283 --> 49:06.482
What then?

49:06.484 --> 49:08.250
Mushroom bombs are standing by

49:08.252 --> 49:10.553
to level the very heart
of Canada.

49:10.555 --> 49:14.390
The prime minister would like us
to try another course of action,

49:14.392 --> 49:16.392
but the president has set
a timetable

49:16.394 --> 49:18.426
for the big red button.

49:18.428 --> 49:19.828
You're the last resort.

49:19.830 --> 49:22.167
That thing is working its way
down the map.

49:22.934 --> 49:24.803
It's coming home.

49:25.435 --> 49:28.571
We've read your official record,
Mr. Barr.

49:28.573 --> 49:30.406
There are certain circles
in the government

49:30.408 --> 49:32.741
that well remember
the things that you've done

49:32.743 --> 49:35.276
for this country in wartime
and out of it.

49:35.278 --> 49:37.912
The levels of training are...

49:37.914 --> 49:39.982
And the flawless record
of success.

49:39.984 --> 49:41.917
It's perfect.

49:41.919 --> 49:44.852
And your services run deep.

49:44.854 --> 49:47.355
That kind of instinct
never goes, does it?

49:47.357 --> 49:49.658
Our men saw what you did
to those thugs the other night.

49:49.660 --> 49:52.464
That was a pretty piece of work.

49:53.830 --> 49:56.665
But I want to return
to my grandfather now

49:56.667 --> 49:58.600
and something
that he told me once

49:58.602 --> 50:02.540
in his stories of war
and of fighting men.

50:03.473 --> 50:05.975
He didn't know how it was done
for certain,

50:05.977 --> 50:12.714
but my grandfather,
he said that someone...

50:12.716 --> 50:14.950
killed...

50:14.952 --> 50:17.019
Yes.
I did.

50:20.258 --> 50:21.826
The Germans.

50:22.827 --> 50:24.662
They moved a lot.

50:25.028 --> 50:26.964
And I moved with them.

50:28.698 --> 50:30.566
I shadowed the Reich
back and forth

50:30.568 --> 50:33.305
across their ill-gotten lands...

50:34.037 --> 50:37.341
...and I moved where they moved.

50:37.774 --> 50:39.910
Until the time was right.

50:41.912 --> 50:44.513
Until I knew where he was.

50:44.515 --> 50:46.917
Until I knew it was him.

50:48.586 --> 50:50.789
And I caught up with them.

50:51.821 --> 50:53.821
You're serious.

50:53.823 --> 50:56.691
The Germans covered it up.

50:56.693 --> 50:58.629
And so did we.

50:59.696 --> 51:03.001
And history marched on,
just like you read about.

51:06.537 --> 51:08.636
By the time I got
to that miserable man,

51:08.638 --> 51:11.609
his words had grown beyond him.

51:12.977 --> 51:15.343
And his ideas continued to do

51:15.345 --> 51:19.251
all the damage they could
possibly do without him.

51:21.718 --> 51:23.954
That day, I just killed a man.

51:26.691 --> 51:29.625
What he stood for
was unstoppable.

51:29.627 --> 51:33.962
I-I'm sorry.
This is, uh, World War... II?

51:33.964 --> 51:35.830
The Nazis.

51:35.832 --> 51:39.334
They had their phonies
all lined up.

51:39.336 --> 51:41.569
Three, maybe four of them

51:41.571 --> 51:44.642
by the time the Russians
put a lid on Berlin.

51:46.609 --> 51:49.944
Project Valkyrie?
A success.

51:49.946 --> 51:51.883
They got number two.

51:53.084 --> 51:55.817
The last one was a coward
and a womanizer...

51:55.819 --> 51:57.955
but a coward first.

51:58.722 --> 52:00.858
Shot himself in a bunker.

52:01.892 --> 52:04.361
Killed his dog, too.

52:05.930 --> 52:09.067
What do you think
the little mustache was for?

52:10.133 --> 52:11.836
The hair?

52:12.569 --> 52:14.472
The uniform?

52:15.039 --> 52:17.605
The entire look...

52:17.607 --> 52:21.676
It was a costume,
all part of a plan.

52:21.678 --> 52:24.682
It's easy to fool the stupid
and the willing.

52:25.883 --> 52:29.386
What I did that day
didn't mean a thing.

52:30.388 --> 52:32.390
I just killed a man.

52:32.957 --> 52:34.759
The monster lived on.

52:36.727 --> 52:41.062
And in the end,
the war was won by heroes.

52:41.064 --> 52:42.700
Not me.

52:43.566 --> 52:44.635
Do you understand?

52:47.104 --> 52:50.908
It was nothing like the
comic book you want it to be.

52:53.544 --> 52:54.913
Now you know.

52:55.678 --> 52:57.779
Are you happy?

52:57.781 --> 53:02.886
<i>S-S'il vous plaît...</i> What <i>are</i>
you gentlemen talking about?

53:03.854 --> 53:06.758
All I ever did
was what they said.

53:08.158 --> 53:09.927
And that's it.

53:11.562 --> 53:15.700
I always did
exactly what they said.

53:19.636 --> 53:21.472
So there it is.

53:22.205 --> 53:23.941
And that's it.

53:25.542 --> 53:27.378
So you'll help us.

53:27.812 --> 53:30.848
I don't work for you anymore.

53:31.848 --> 53:36.488
And now if you'll please be
on your way.

53:36.854 --> 53:39.156
I apologize for...

53:41.057 --> 53:43.691
...the inconvenience.

53:46.095 --> 53:51.468
But the hour is late,
and my show is about to start.

53:53.136 --> 53:55.002
How about that coffee?

53:55.004 --> 53:57.171
You already ate.

54:31.675 --> 54:33.741
What do you think?

55:01.071 --> 55:02.640
Wait.

55:12.749 --> 55:14.216
But this is your favorite.

55:14.218 --> 55:16.053
I want you to have it.

55:16.921 --> 55:19.557
I'll take good care of him.

55:31.001 --> 55:32.669
Hello?

55:35.705 --> 55:37.541
Hello?

56:05.769 --> 56:07.002
Yes?

56:07.004 --> 56:09.738
Did you just call me?

56:09.740 --> 56:11.109
Yes.

56:14.678 --> 56:17.048
Sorry I called so late.

56:17.615 --> 56:20.051
Hope I didn't cause a stir.

56:22.019 --> 56:24.285
Starting to get cooler out.

56:24.287 --> 56:25.856
Yeah.

56:26.990 --> 56:29.191
I brought you some hot cocoa.

56:35.899 --> 56:37.135
Wait a minute.

56:40.937 --> 56:43.138
Got to have the marshmallows.

56:43.140 --> 56:44.742
Got to.

56:52.883 --> 56:56.317
Oh. Good.
Thank you.

56:56.319 --> 57:00.055
Oh, it's just that same old
powdered stuff.

57:00.057 --> 57:04.993
Did you want to talk about
something or just... sit quietly?

57:04.995 --> 57:06.763
Either way, it's fine.

57:08.298 --> 57:10.667
Someone came to see me.

57:12.169 --> 57:14.435
Wants me to do something.

57:14.437 --> 57:16.374
Who?

57:17.040 --> 57:18.743
The government.

57:19.910 --> 57:21.846
Governments, rather.

57:22.211 --> 57:25.282
American and Canadian.

57:27.350 --> 57:29.653
It's the Bigfoot, Ed.

57:30.854 --> 57:32.991
They want me to kill it.

57:33.990 --> 57:37.828
It's the carrier
of this plague-type thing.

57:38.194 --> 57:40.095
Well, that's no good.

57:40.097 --> 57:41.832
No.

57:43.332 --> 57:45.801
They couldn't find anyone else?

57:45.803 --> 57:47.372
Nope.

57:48.004 --> 57:49.805
What did you tell them?

57:49.807 --> 57:51.809
I said no.

57:53.010 --> 57:54.245
Could you do it?

57:54.944 --> 57:56.948
I don't want to kill again.

57:58.115 --> 58:00.184
Be it beast or man.

58:01.218 --> 58:03.254
I don't want to have a hand
in that anymore.

58:04.921 --> 58:08.258
Are you sure you made the right
decision, then, for you?

58:09.026 --> 58:11.258
I'm wondering
why you called me here

58:11.260 --> 58:15.229
if you weren't already thinking
about leaving.

58:15.231 --> 58:18.201
Why do you believe
anything I'm saying?

58:20.269 --> 58:23.840
Because most men live
their whole lives one way.

58:25.876 --> 58:29.080
And when a liar is a liar,
he's a liar.

58:29.479 --> 58:34.816
And when a fancy man is fancy,
he's fancy.

58:34.818 --> 58:40.892
And when an honest man
is honest... he's honest.

58:44.794 --> 58:46.897
Be careful, Calvin.

58:48.031 --> 58:50.168
I still want to go fishing.

58:54.071 --> 58:57.008
I'll thank you
to look after the dog.

59:28.839 --> 59:30.971
- Good to see you, Barr.
- Yeah.

59:30.973 --> 59:34.077
Monsieur Barr,
if you will follow me.

59:47.057 --> 59:49.191
We are just outside
the dead zone.

59:49.193 --> 59:50.991
The fire you see
is a containment measure.

59:50.993 --> 59:52.861
It is a controlled burn.

59:52.863 --> 59:55.029
The ring of fire encircles
the dead zone.

59:55.031 --> 59:57.131
Nothing gets in.
Nothing gets out.

59:57.133 --> 59:59.033
You will be given
your choice of fatigue.

59:59.035 --> 01:00:02.069
I think you will find
the selection suitable.

01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:04.973
You will also have your choice
of, uh, gear.

01:00:04.975 --> 01:00:06.508
And weapons.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.977
Once you are inside
the dead zone,

01:00:08.979 --> 01:00:12.513
our entire operation
will fall back another 50 miles

01:00:12.515 --> 01:00:16.119
and you will be the last and
final hope in saving this land.

01:00:16.953 --> 01:00:18.089
And yours.

01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:21.223
These Canucks, God bless 'em,
they didn't have the goods

01:00:21.225 --> 01:00:24.558
when it came to firepower,
so I sent for my private stock.

01:00:39.508 --> 01:00:40.642
That gun.

01:00:40.644 --> 01:00:42.576
That scope.

01:00:42.578 --> 01:00:44.314
This knife.

01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:46.150
That's it.

01:00:49.285 --> 01:00:51.886
<i>Merci,</i> Monsieur Barr.

01:00:51.888 --> 01:00:53.290
<i>Merci.</i>

01:02:22.745 --> 01:02:24.645
Barr, we have your location.

01:02:24.647 --> 01:02:27.450
What's the status?
Did you get it?

01:02:28.151 --> 01:02:29.417
Not yet.

01:02:29.419 --> 01:02:31.618
We heard a shot fired.
Was that you?

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.687
Yeah.

01:02:32.689 --> 01:02:34.089
Was it a hit?

01:02:34.091 --> 01:02:35.689
- Yeah.
- Where?

01:02:35.691 --> 01:02:37.024
Its head.

01:02:37.026 --> 01:02:39.560
It... And it's not dead?

01:02:39.562 --> 01:02:41.229
No.

01:02:41.231 --> 01:02:42.763
So where is it?

01:02:42.765 --> 01:02:44.332
It ran off.

01:02:44.334 --> 01:02:45.937
Where?

01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:48.269
I'll get it.

01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:50.004
Time's running out, Barr.

01:02:50.006 --> 01:02:52.540
Yeah.
I know what time it is.

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:54.211
How are you?

01:02:55.345 --> 01:02:57.745
Led me off a cliff.

01:02:57.747 --> 01:02:59.647
Broke my little pinkie.

01:02:59.649 --> 01:03:01.649
Sorry.
Uh, come again.

01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:05.489
My fifth digit.
I broke it.

01:03:07.024 --> 01:03:09.993
Well, be careful
of that kind of thing.

01:03:11.595 --> 01:03:14.198
He doesn't have big feet,
either.

01:03:14.597 --> 01:03:17.267
Not really living up
to its name.

01:03:18.702 --> 01:03:21.136
We're all with you, Barr.

01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:24.107
You won't hear from me again
until the end.

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.109
Over.

01:04:34.577 --> 01:04:36.379
Poultice.

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:49.586
Hm.

01:05:50.586 --> 01:05:52.489
Vegetarian.

01:06:43.807 --> 01:06:45.542
Hello.

01:06:56.885 --> 01:06:58.655
Bye.

01:07:50.307 --> 01:07:52.406
My dear Calvin.

01:07:52.408 --> 01:07:56.479
I've written you so many times
that I can't keep count anymore.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.718
I can almost hear
what you'd say back.

01:08:01.584 --> 01:08:04.989
Sometimes I think of a joke
you would say, and I laugh.

01:08:06.022 --> 01:08:08.022
Then I feel foolish.

01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:14.264
It's been a long time
since I've heard from you.

01:08:14.798 --> 01:08:19.002
They say that you're alive
but that I can't talk to you...

01:08:19.968 --> 01:08:23.939
...that you can't write me
even if you wanted to.

01:08:25.573 --> 01:08:27.774
I walked by your house today

01:08:27.776 --> 01:08:30.613
just to be somewhere
that we once were.

01:08:31.013 --> 01:08:33.081
I've gone sappy, Calvin.

01:08:33.082 --> 01:08:34.916
Me.

01:08:34.917 --> 01:08:38.419
I watched the mailman put one
of my letters through your door.

01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:41.792
They stopped forwarding them
long ago, I guess.

01:08:42.658 --> 01:08:46.027
There's a school back home
that could use my help,

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:47.997
closer to Mom and Dad.

01:08:48.631 --> 01:08:51.001
Mom's been sick lately.

01:08:51.568 --> 01:08:53.671
So I'm leaving here.

01:08:54.037 --> 01:08:56.571
Saw Ed to say goodbye.

01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:58.505
He misses you too.

01:08:58.506 --> 01:09:01.912
Everyone does... me especially.

01:09:03.412 --> 01:09:05.348
Please come home soon.

01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:08.383
I love you.

01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:23.499
P.S... Do you like the stamp?

01:09:23.966 --> 01:09:25.899
It's of Dick Tracy.

01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:28.135
I know how much you like
that strip.

01:09:28.136 --> 01:09:30.872
I clipped a bunch out
for when you get back.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.577
I didn't miss a day.

01:13:46.928 --> 01:13:49.665
They're not gonna have
your body, old man.

01:15:51.387 --> 01:15:53.457
This isn't what I wanted.

01:15:54.323 --> 01:15:56.026
And I'm sorry.

01:16:27.957 --> 01:16:29.993
My brother was a good man.

01:16:30.592 --> 01:16:32.128
A thoughtful man.

01:16:32.861 --> 01:16:34.562
He was selfless.

01:16:34.564 --> 01:16:37.167
He didn't know pride.

01:16:37.833 --> 01:16:38.898
He loved a girl.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.937
She was... special.

01:16:43.071 --> 01:16:48.878
The war kept them apart...
and she passed away young.

01:16:50.879 --> 01:16:52.449
Too young.

01:16:53.415 --> 01:16:57.287
I didn't get to know Calvin
the way a brother should.

01:16:58.221 --> 01:16:59.923
But I'll miss him.

01:17:00.856 --> 01:17:04.894
I always... missed him.

01:17:07.997 --> 01:17:11.034
Okay.
How's that?

01:17:12.901 --> 01:17:15.635
Oh.
Very fine, Ed.

01:17:15.637 --> 01:17:18.404
All right.
That means we're almost done.

01:17:18.406 --> 01:17:23.277
Say, uh, I'm really sorry
to hear about your brother.

01:17:23.279 --> 01:17:24.881
Calvin.

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.885
You know, I didn't really
know him very well, but...

01:17:29.517 --> 01:17:31.352
...it sounds like he was
a pretty decent guy.

01:17:31.354 --> 01:17:33.923
He was.
Thank you.

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:38.091
So, uh...

01:17:38.093 --> 01:17:40.493
So folks say that...

01:17:40.495 --> 01:17:46.200
he left for vacation and just...
never came back, huh?

01:17:46.202 --> 01:17:48.001
That's a shame.

01:17:48.003 --> 01:17:49.603
Well, I don't know.

01:17:49.605 --> 01:17:53.974
He, uh, went someplace nice,
someplace warm.

01:17:53.976 --> 01:17:55.975
Nice view of the sea, you know?

01:17:55.977 --> 01:17:58.411
I mean, it's better
than him dying

01:17:58.413 --> 01:18:01.450
in that old house
all by his lonesome, right?

01:18:02.284 --> 01:18:03.550
Yeah.

01:18:03.552 --> 01:18:05.622
You're all set.
Get some candy.

01:18:07.355 --> 01:18:09.258
All right.

01:18:10.025 --> 01:18:11.224
Well...

01:18:12.595 --> 01:18:14.231
...take care of yourself, Ed.

01:18:16.665 --> 01:18:18.666
Say, you going to
the school play tomorrow night?

01:18:18.668 --> 01:18:20.166
Wouldn't miss it.

01:18:20.168 --> 01:18:22.202
My granddaughter's playing
a butterfly.

01:18:22.204 --> 01:18:23.536
Ah.
Yeah.

01:18:23.538 --> 01:18:25.339
Him too.

01:18:25.341 --> 01:18:27.107
Plays a turtle.

01:18:27.109 --> 01:18:28.709
It's the lead turtle.

01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:11.553
Can I come out there with you?

01:19:13.088 --> 01:19:16.325
I said some nice things
about you at your grave.

01:19:17.025 --> 01:19:19.194
Wish I could've been there.

01:19:20.096 --> 01:19:22.464
Thanks for keeping care
of Ralph.

01:19:23.265 --> 01:19:25.334
It wasn't a problem.

01:19:26.569 --> 01:19:28.368
What did you bury?

01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:31.341
Oh.
Your uniform.

01:19:32.007 --> 01:19:33.139
Your medals.

01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:34.675
Good.

01:19:36.479 --> 01:19:38.778
I can't believe you're...

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.016
Can we just sit quiet, Ed?

01:19:41.684 --> 01:19:43.285
Okay.

01:19:43.753 --> 01:19:45.786
Sounds good.

01:19:52.494 --> 01:19:54.294
All right, then.

01:20:03.239 --> 01:20:05.575
Mm.
Cripes.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.139
Hello.

01:20:46.414 --> 01:20:48.549
Where is she? I can't see her.

01:20:48.551 --> 01:20:50.587
She's the butterfly.

01:20:51.454 --> 01:20:52.789
Oh.

01:20:53.422 --> 01:20:56.659
A lot of butterflies are dead
this time of year.

01:20:59.227 --> 01:21:01.127
What?

01:21:01.129 --> 01:21:03.665
This late in the season?
It's true.

01:21:16.678 --> 01:21:18.647
Did you...

01:21:20.516 --> 01:21:22.352
Did you bury the...

01:21:23.651 --> 01:21:25.654
Under my bed.

01:21:26.288 --> 01:21:27.286
Did you?

01:21:27.288 --> 01:21:28.657
Yes.

01:21:30.325 --> 01:21:33.730
I thought you'd feel better
with...

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.567
Calvin, I-I'm sorry.

01:21:40.569 --> 01:21:42.236
- Ah.
- I'm sorry.

01:21:42.238 --> 01:21:43.640
It's okay.

01:22:39.528 --> 01:22:40.928
Hey.

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:43.496
Let's take a walk.

01:22:45.568 --> 01:22:48.402
At school today, um,
one of my students came up

01:22:48.404 --> 01:22:50.403
and turned in his journal.

01:22:50.405 --> 01:22:51.938
His name's Jimmy.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.675
He's a nice boy.

01:22:54.677 --> 01:22:57.678
He tries real hard.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.680
Uh, and I noticed that he had
a scrape on his forehead,

01:23:00.682 --> 01:23:02.316
and I asked him how he got it.

01:23:02.318 --> 01:23:04.384
And he said that he wrote
about it in his journal

01:23:04.386 --> 01:23:05.719
and asked me if I would read it.

01:23:05.721 --> 01:23:09.656
So I read it
during my lunch break.

01:23:09.658 --> 01:23:15.895
Uh, it said that Jimmy and
his friends were playing war.

01:23:15.897 --> 01:23:18.298
You know... war.

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.568
Sure.
Popguns and whatnot.

01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:23.370
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.

01:23:23.372 --> 01:23:25.505
And Jimmy was on the bad side.

01:23:25.507 --> 01:23:27.340
He was playing
one of the bad guys.

01:23:27.342 --> 01:23:30.410
And he went up this tree.

01:23:30.412 --> 01:23:33.779
And while he was hiding,
he lost his footing and fell out

01:23:33.781 --> 01:23:35.881
and landed on one of his friends
below.

01:23:37.753 --> 01:23:40.953
And all the kids ran over to
make sure that they were okay.

01:23:40.955 --> 01:23:43.490
Except one.
This one kid.

01:23:43.492 --> 01:23:47.560
He runs up and he shoots
all the bad guys

01:23:47.562 --> 01:23:50.266
and then brags that he's won.

01:23:51.367 --> 01:23:54.870
And I guess technically he did.

01:23:55.537 --> 01:23:58.540
The other kids
didn't have to help.

01:23:59.475 --> 01:24:02.812
So... the bad guys lost.

01:24:03.378 --> 01:24:07.950
And Jimmy felt really bad
about the whole thing.

01:24:08.516 --> 01:24:14.888
I'm... I'm not exactly sure what
he wanted me to get out of that,

01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:16.756
but he wrote about it
in such detail.

01:24:16.758 --> 01:24:19.895
It must have
really bothered him.

01:24:21.763 --> 01:24:22.899
Huh.

01:24:24.932 --> 01:24:28.637
He probably wants to know what
you think of a kid like that.

01:24:29.038 --> 01:24:32.008
Your opinion
is probably important to him.

01:24:33.409 --> 01:24:35.311
What do you think?

01:24:36.345 --> 01:24:38.448
Of the kid who shot at people?

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.581
I don't know.

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:44.917
A kid like that grows up to be
someone important, I think.

01:24:44.919 --> 01:24:47.586
Like a...
Like the boss in a factory

01:24:47.588 --> 01:24:50.791
or... maybe the president.

01:24:50.793 --> 01:24:53.263
I don't know.

01:24:54.797 --> 01:24:56.529
Kids are tough.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.902
What kind of kid were you?

01:25:01.904 --> 01:25:03.603
I'd be the kid

01:25:03.605 --> 01:25:05.906
that Jimmy squished
when he fell out of the tree.

01:25:45.913 --> 01:25:48.383
See you later, Calvin.

01:25:53.154 --> 01:25:54.890
Tomorrow, I...

01:25:56.425 --> 01:26:01.029
I thought maybe you could...
drive me to the station.

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.336
I can't.

01:26:08.704 --> 01:26:10.073
Why not?

01:26:12.473 --> 01:26:18.812
Because... tonight I'm happy,
and...

01:26:18.814 --> 01:26:20.917
tomorrow I won't be.

01:26:25.887 --> 01:26:27.821
I can't watch you go.

01:26:27.823 --> 01:26:29.492
I...

01:26:51.646 --> 01:26:53.882
When we get to your house...

01:26:55.717 --> 01:26:57.954
...I'm just gonna keep walking.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.621
Maybe the next time
that I see you,

01:27:02.623 --> 01:27:06.728
it'll be like you just stopped
to tie your shoelace.

01:27:33.087 --> 01:27:34.589
Listen.

01:27:34.989 --> 01:27:37.025
I, uh...

01:27:41.195 --> 01:27:43.498
I'm right behind you.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.537
Catch up quick.

01:28:15.696 --> 01:28:17.632
All right.
Come on.

01:29:09.717 --> 01:29:10.919
Huh.

01:29:51.627 --> 01:29:53.796
Another day, boy.

01:29:54.829 --> 01:29:57.229
Maybe tomorrow.

01:29:57.231 --> 01:29:58.868
What do you think?

01:30:38.039 --> 01:30:40.141
There it is.

01:30:56.792 --> 01:30:58.023
Come on, boy!

01:30:58.025 --> 01:30:59.794
Let's go home.

01:31:53.478 --> 01:31:58.478
