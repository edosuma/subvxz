WEBVTT

00:03.896 --> 00:05.004
I'm sorry.

00:05.748 --> 00:07.080
-I can't.
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:07.233 --> 00:08.732
-I shouldn't have
tried to kiss you...
-No, no.

00:08.734 --> 00:10.067
Don't be sorry. I'm sorry.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.251
You shouldn't be sorry.

00:11.403 --> 00:12.660
Well, neither one of us
should be sorry.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.737
You're right.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.072
BOTH:
Sorry.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.574
It's just...
we were having a good time,

00:17.593 --> 00:19.409
and I thought
you were looking at my mouth,

00:19.428 --> 00:21.261
but maybe that's
'cause these two teeth are fake.

00:21.413 --> 00:23.188
When I was ten, Donna Grasley
pushed me off the swings

00:23.415 --> 00:24.581
'cause I tried to kiss her,

00:24.641 --> 00:26.099
and I am starting to see
a pattern here.

00:26.252 --> 00:28.343
No, don't feel bad.
Uh, we were having a moment.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.920
You know, the lights, the music.

00:30.013 --> 00:31.530
I've got a little smoky eye
thing going on.

00:31.681 --> 00:32.923
I did a YouTube tutorial.

00:32.941 --> 00:35.926
But Max is my boyfriend. I...

00:35.944 --> 00:37.369
I know.

00:37.596 --> 00:39.279
Please don't tell him
about this.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.765
Oh, Zoey,
I-I have to tell him.

00:41.784 --> 00:43.767
We don't keep things like this
from each other.

00:43.860 --> 00:44.951
But this is important.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.453
He doesn't know I'm gay.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.880
Oh.

00:48.031 --> 00:50.123
Oh, I didn't know
you were gay, either.

00:50.276 --> 00:51.441
Though you did kiss me.

00:51.535 --> 00:53.293
Sometimes I worry
I'd be a terrible detective.

00:53.445 --> 00:55.370
I don't tell people I work with.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.613
I've barely told anyone.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.615
Just a couple of close friends
and a lady I met

00:58.634 --> 01:01.376
on the plane once, but that was
'cause she looked like Tina Fey.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.544
You get it.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.970
Max won't say anything.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.289
You can trust us.

01:05.307 --> 01:06.381
I can't risk it, Kat.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.882
No one is buying a country album

01:07.976 --> 01:09.626
about how much I want to
hook up with Tina Fey.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.570
Okay, okay.

01:12.464 --> 01:15.574
Glasses, super smart,
lovable goofball.

01:15.801 --> 01:17.034
Girl's got a type.

01:17.986 --> 01:19.578
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:19.729 --> 01:22.956
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:24.143 --> 01:26.919
"You plus me times forever
equals us"?

01:27.088 --> 01:28.587
"You're a-meow-zing"?

01:28.738 --> 01:30.589
(sighs) Snowball.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.174
You have no idea.

01:35.838 --> 01:37.654
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, hey.

01:37.747 --> 01:39.005
Shh, go back night night.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.432
-Ah. (chuckles)
-Shh, night night.

01:40.584 --> 01:42.101
I was trying to stay up
to see you, but I think

01:42.328 --> 01:44.252
-doing all that math
made me tired.
-(chuckles)

01:44.346 --> 01:45.920
It's really cute, thank you.

01:45.998 --> 01:49.015
I'll explain tomorrow why this
equation is a total disaster.

01:49.168 --> 01:51.593
(chuckles) How was karaoke?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.170
Oh, it was really fun.

01:53.263 --> 01:55.005
-Yeah, did all my faves.
-Mm.

01:55.023 --> 01:57.282
Vanilla Ice, Bon Jovi,
a little Katy Perry.

01:57.434 --> 01:59.701
-"I Kissed a Girl"?
-I did not...

02:00.529 --> 02:01.829
...sing that song.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.014
I'm sorry we fought earlier.

02:04.032 --> 02:05.624
I should have just
joined you guys.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.017
I'm glad that you and Zoey

02:07.110 --> 02:08.610
are getting to know
each other, though.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.704
Oh, I-I wouldn't say we're
getting to know each other.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.356
Like, what's her favorite color?

02:12.374 --> 02:13.799
You know,
what's her birth stone?

02:13.968 --> 02:15.450
What's her middle name?
It could be anything.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.952
You know, like Ginger,
Mary Ann, Mrs. Howell.

02:17.972 --> 02:18.971
I don't know.

02:19.198 --> 02:20.955
Well, we're both up.

02:20.975 --> 02:25.369
Maybe you plus me
equals sexy time?

02:25.387 --> 02:27.479
Max, I-I need
to tell you something.

02:27.665 --> 02:29.039
Okay.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.374
I-I've been going back and forth

02:30.467 --> 02:31.966
about whether I should even
say anything,

02:31.986 --> 02:34.153
But I-I just...
I think I have to.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.696
Um...

02:37.140 --> 02:39.700
Earlier tonight, I...

02:41.495 --> 02:44.746
...got us both Taco Bell
and I ate yours in the car.

02:46.816 --> 02:48.125
Wow.

02:49.653 --> 02:51.545
One question.

02:52.489 --> 02:54.590
Did you do it just to hurt me?

02:56.010 --> 02:58.135
(laughs)

03:02.408 --> 03:03.907
Here you go.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.743
One sugar-free
vanilla nonfat latte.

03:06.836 --> 03:09.746
Uh, I ordered a chocolate peanut
butter smoothie and a muffin.

03:09.839 --> 03:13.508
I know, but your wife and
your arteries will thank me.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.602
No, no, no. I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.937
Uh, let me get you that muffin.

03:17.089 --> 03:19.156
No, no. She's right.

03:20.850 --> 03:24.352
Mother, I told you--
no body shaming the customers

03:24.446 --> 03:25.779
or the cats.

03:25.931 --> 03:28.281
You're not fat, you're fluffy.

03:28.434 --> 03:32.602
So, have we finally decided
on a color for the cabinets?

03:32.696 --> 03:34.862
Green is very trendy right now.

03:34.957 --> 03:37.941
It's the Brazilian butt lift
of paint.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.868
Are we worried that green
is gonna make us crave pizza?

03:40.963 --> 03:42.370
-What?
-Here we go again.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.389
Green?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

03:44.616 --> 03:47.542
Pizza? I can't believe
I had to explain that.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.785
What about blue?

03:48.878 --> 03:50.229
Are you kidding me?

03:50.456 --> 03:52.547
I said blue two weeks ago
and you loved it at first,

03:52.641 --> 03:54.624
but then you said
your favorite shirt was blue

03:54.643 --> 03:56.643
and it makes you happy
every time you wear it,

03:56.720 --> 03:58.720
so if your kitchen was blue,
you would always be happy,

03:58.814 --> 04:00.572
which means when you wore
your favorite shirt

04:00.724 --> 04:02.407
it wouldn't mean anything.

04:02.559 --> 04:05.059
Yeah, I can't
do that to Shirty.

04:05.153 --> 04:06.820
Well, I can't do this anymore.

04:06.972 --> 04:08.896
Go to the store
and buy the butt green paint.

04:08.991 --> 04:10.807
And by the way,
Shirty makes you look fat.

04:10.826 --> 04:13.252
(gasps) Well, now the cabinets
can be any color

04:13.403 --> 04:15.629
'cause I'll never
be happy again.

04:17.407 --> 04:18.999
Hey, can I talk to you all
a second?

04:19.093 --> 04:20.575
-I'm working.
-Oh, my break's over.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.835
Someone kissed me.

04:21.987 --> 04:23.077
-I've got time.
-Ooh, spill that tea.

04:23.839 --> 04:26.840
I've been sworn to secrecy, so
I can't reveal any identities,

04:26.992 --> 04:30.602
but rest assured, this kiss
was illicit and forbidden.

04:30.829 --> 04:32.253
And imaginary?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.439
Oh, trust me, she was real.
(gasps)

04:35.334 --> 04:36.833
He was re... They were real.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.685
No, I made it up.
I lie for attention.

04:38.837 --> 04:40.670
I knew it.
You're a lesbian.

04:40.764 --> 04:41.929
I wish your father was alive

04:41.949 --> 04:44.541
so I could tell him
"I told you so."

04:44.543 --> 04:46.526
Mother, I'm not gay.

04:46.678 --> 04:47.694
Oh, really?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.179
Well, your shoes
tell a different story.

04:49.197 --> 04:53.107
The question is
should I tell Max about it?

04:53.127 --> 04:55.852
Depends on the kiss.
Did you linger?

04:55.945 --> 04:58.688
Technically,
how long is lingering?

04:58.707 --> 05:00.874
-She lingered.
-Yeah, she did.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.950
I don't have feelings
for this person,

05:02.970 --> 05:03.969
so do I tell Max?

05:04.120 --> 05:06.120
I don't think
you need to tell him.

05:06.214 --> 05:07.881
No harm, no foul.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.475
Although if I kissed a woman,
I would definitely tell Carter.

05:10.627 --> 05:12.126
I would never have to get him
another birthday present

05:12.220 --> 05:14.062
for the rest of his life.

05:16.391 --> 05:17.816
What up, YouTube?

05:17.967 --> 05:20.968
This is your girl Randi with
another episode of<i> Hot Lots.</i>

05:21.063 --> 05:22.379
I gave Carter the day off

05:22.397 --> 05:24.489
because while he can't
make any decisions,

05:24.641 --> 05:27.233
I am this close
to making a big one.

05:27.386 --> 05:28.810
Plus, he got upset
when he realized

05:28.829 --> 05:30.053
the stripping we're doing today

05:30.072 --> 05:32.405
is just taking off
this paneling.

05:32.558 --> 05:34.240
I was equally disappointed.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.835
Apparently,
I waxed for nothing.

05:36.986 --> 05:38.562
(chuckles)
Okay, now I'm gonna wedge

05:38.580 --> 05:42.174
my handy-dandy pry bar
in here, and...

05:44.845 --> 05:46.511
Voilà!

05:46.738 --> 05:49.072
Uh, all right, I s-I said...

05:49.165 --> 05:51.908
I said...

05:51.927 --> 05:53.334
voilà!

05:54.096 --> 05:56.003
Maybe if we do
the other kind of stripping

05:56.098 --> 05:58.915
a man will show up and help.

05:58.934 --> 06:02.027
J-Just turn off the damn camera.

06:09.928 --> 06:12.596
See?
See how easy that was?

06:12.598 --> 06:14.114
(panting)

06:14.266 --> 06:16.266
Now, this is the type of thing
you can do yourself

06:16.284 --> 06:19.211
so there's no reason to, um...

06:20.439 --> 06:21.938
...pay anybody.

06:22.031 --> 06:25.032
Uh-oh.
Instead of taking videos,

06:25.085 --> 06:28.278
it seems I took
three photos of you.

06:28.371 --> 06:30.280
Are you serious right now?

06:30.373 --> 06:32.799
Yes, and they are not good.

06:32.951 --> 06:35.060
Oh, I'm so sick
of this stupid project!

06:35.287 --> 06:37.954
What makes me think that
we could build our own condo?

06:38.047 --> 06:41.291
I don't even like building
my own Grand Slam at Denny's.

06:41.309 --> 06:42.459
Just give me the original.

06:42.552 --> 06:45.070
Eggs, bacon,
sausage and coffee,

06:45.297 --> 06:48.907
just like my mama,
'cause she cold and Black.

06:49.134 --> 06:52.411
Okay, I got the video working,
but now it's me.

06:52.562 --> 06:54.971
Hello, beautiful.

06:55.064 --> 06:56.665
Wait.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.233
What?

06:59.327 --> 07:00.160
Oh.

07:00.312 --> 07:03.171
It's, like, a weird little room.

07:04.149 --> 07:06.741
Okay.
Please, God, no bodies.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.076
No bodies, no bodies.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.504
Ooh, delightful.

07:11.598 --> 07:15.725
Oh, this is where you can
hang the sex swing.

07:16.845 --> 07:19.646

Sweet Rosie O'Donnell,
what is she doing here?

07:48.043 --> 07:50.135
Aah! Hot! Hot!

07:50.362 --> 07:52.012
Kat?

07:53.031 --> 07:54.214
'Sup?

07:54.308 --> 07:56.199
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, totally.

07:56.218 --> 07:58.201
I was just, uh, doing the, uh,

07:58.294 --> 08:01.480
"fall down the stairs with hot
coffee challenge" to end racism.

08:01.631 --> 08:04.891
Okay. Do you want a towel
or a clean T-shirt?

08:05.043 --> 08:07.301
-Maybe an MRI?
-No, I'm-I'm good.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.379
Hello, Zoey.
(chuckles)

08:09.397 --> 08:10.563
Hi.

08:10.716 --> 08:12.215
Thank you.

08:12.234 --> 08:14.308
So, how's-how's it going here?

08:14.328 --> 08:16.328
Doing your-your writing thang?

08:16.479 --> 08:19.072
Singing your songs,
rocking and rolling,

08:19.224 --> 08:21.391
jingling and jangling,
riffing and raffing?

08:21.409 --> 08:24.002
(short chuckle) Maybe I hit
my head harder than I thought.

08:24.153 --> 08:25.895
Uh, today's been a grind.

08:25.914 --> 08:28.990
Yeah, maybe we should
just call it.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.066
I can't focus.

08:30.159 --> 08:32.177
Oh, no, I think
I'm distracting her.

08:32.328 --> 08:36.163
This coffee has made my shirt
cling in all the right places.

08:36.258 --> 08:37.907
Oh, okay.
Yeah, we can...

08:38.001 --> 08:39.259
I guess we can just
pick it up tomorrow.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.911
-Great, see you.
-(chuckles)

08:41.930 --> 08:43.596
See you.

08:43.749 --> 08:45.690
May the road rise to...

08:45.917 --> 08:47.600
-(door closes)
-meet your feet.

08:47.753 --> 08:49.677
Did Zoey seem weird to you?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.087
No.
Not at all.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.513
Not at all, but, you know,
look who you're asking--

08:52.533 --> 08:55.367
a 41-year-old
who owns a cat café.

08:55.518 --> 08:57.610
Lovable goofball.

08:57.763 --> 08:59.037
I don't know.

08:59.188 --> 09:01.373
She barely said a word to me
all morning.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.041
God, I hope
I didn't offend her.

09:03.118 --> 09:06.286
I don't mean to look
down her shirt, I'm just tall.

09:06.438 --> 09:08.271
Max, I'm-I'm sure it's nothing.

09:08.364 --> 09:09.864
It doesn't feel like nothing.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.384
It feels like
she doesn't like me

09:12.611 --> 09:14.294
or she doesn't
think I'm talented, or...

09:14.388 --> 09:16.446
God, I just wish
I knew what I did.

09:16.539 --> 09:17.614
Maybe I'll text her.

09:17.632 --> 09:19.683
Max, i-it's not you.

09:20.969 --> 09:22.561
Last night...

09:23.805 --> 09:25.730
...Zoey and I kissed.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.474
What?

09:28.627 --> 09:30.643
I know, and I wanted to tell you
right when it happened,

09:30.737 --> 09:31.886
but she's not out.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.980
That's why she's been
so freaking weird.

09:34.132 --> 09:36.575
I'm-I'm sorry. We had
just sung "Teenage Dream,"

09:36.760 --> 09:38.076
and you know what that's like.

09:38.269 --> 09:39.411
How could you do that?

09:39.562 --> 09:41.746
You know how important
this is to me. God, Kat.

09:41.973 --> 09:45.066
-Well, give me
a second to explain.
-I got to go fix this.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.626
Max, I...

09:50.591 --> 09:52.406
For legal reasons,
Fox has asked me to tell you

09:52.500 --> 09:54.000
not to attempt
the "fall down the stairs

09:54.094 --> 09:55.985
with hot coffee challenge."

09:56.763 --> 09:59.413
<i>-WOMAN (over phone): Breathe in.</i>
-(inhales deeply)

09:59.433 --> 10:00.840
<i> -Breathe out.</i>
-(exhales)

10:00.934 --> 10:03.768
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> the Bad Bitch Relaxation App,</i>

10:03.995 --> 10:06.253
<i> where we'll help you</i>
<i> feel okurrr!</i>

10:06.273 --> 10:08.331
Ooh, yeah,
I know that's right.

10:08.424 --> 10:10.591
Skrrt, skrrt!
(laughs)

10:10.669 --> 10:12.777
(phone vibrates)

10:12.946 --> 10:14.671
Hey, babe.
How was the paint store?

10:14.764 --> 10:17.264
Well, I got to thinking.

10:18.026 --> 10:19.767
Are we really
green cabinet people?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.010
I thought so.

10:21.179 --> 10:23.863
Well, I thought so, too,
until Keith weighed in.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.773
I-Is Keith the paint guy?

10:25.792 --> 10:26.958
<i> No, that's Roger.</i>

10:27.127 --> 10:28.960
Keith was in the parking lot
selling candy bars.

10:29.037 --> 10:31.212
He's the one who convinced me
to go back inside.

10:32.115 --> 10:33.206
Can you come down to the garage

10:33.300 --> 10:34.524
and help
me bring up all these samples?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.542
Samples?
I thought we agreed that we...

10:36.637 --> 10:38.637
I know, but I got 12
that I really like,

10:38.788 --> 10:40.046
eight I think you'll like,

10:40.198 --> 10:42.715
and four more that Keith said
matched my aura.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.226
I'm magenta dominant.

10:47.889 --> 10:50.223
Lord, you cannot kill
your fiancé,

10:50.375 --> 10:52.466
you are too hot for prison.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.654
I-I'm not at home.
I had to go back to work.

10:55.881 --> 10:56.971
Why?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.824
Because Kat got stuck
in the pastry case.

11:00.051 --> 11:01.993
Yeah, I told her that
she couldn't fit,

11:02.220 --> 11:04.070
and boy, did she prove me wrong.
(chuckles)

11:04.222 --> 11:05.997
So now we're waiting
for the fire department.

11:06.149 --> 11:07.891
Ooh, ooh, that's them now.

11:07.909 --> 11:10.126
(imitates siren)
I got to go.

11:16.902 --> 11:18.084
Ooh!

11:18.845 --> 11:21.012
What am I doing?
This is crazy.

11:26.169 --> 11:27.668
All right, quitting time.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.504
Uh, in a half hour, but sure.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.749
Don't forget,
I got here late this morning,

11:32.767 --> 11:34.767
so it all evens out.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.769
Well, did you at least
empty the garbage?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.197
-Nah.
-Did you clean the litter boxes?

11:39.348 --> 11:40.924
-No.
-Okay, well, did you...

11:41.017 --> 11:43.034
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I didn't.

11:44.262 --> 11:47.205
Hey, where have you been?
I've been texting you.

11:47.432 --> 11:49.023
Zoey doesn't want
to work with me anymore.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.357
What? Why?

11:50.452 --> 11:52.210
Yeah, because of what happened
with you two.

11:52.361 --> 11:53.878
Hold up.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.547
Zoey's the person
who kissed you?

11:55.774 --> 11:57.364
I thought you were leaving.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.009
Are you kidding?
I got half an hour left.

12:02.297 --> 12:04.630
You know how much I needed
this thing with Zoey.

12:04.783 --> 12:07.967
Do you get how bad it looks
that she's dumping me like this?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.562
My manager is freaking out.
He could drop me.

12:10.713 --> 12:13.064
Okay, well, you're acting
like I did this on purpose.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.457
It doesn't matter!

12:14.459 --> 12:15.567
You spend one night with Zoey

12:15.794 --> 12:17.293
and you screw everything up.

12:17.386 --> 12:18.644
Hey, I was only out with her

12:18.797 --> 12:19.979
'cause you barely
have time for me anymore.

12:20.131 --> 12:22.148
Do you even care
about my feelings here?

12:22.225 --> 12:25.485
(scoffs) I have bigger problems
than your feelings.

12:25.637 --> 12:29.305
I am over 40
in a business where 25 is old.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.082
-This may have been
my last shot.
-All right,

12:31.309 --> 12:33.918
-come on, Max, I...
-Just do me a favor--

12:34.145 --> 12:35.587
stay out of my career.

12:38.741 --> 12:41.593
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.077
Is there anything I can do?

12:43.171 --> 12:44.095
I don't think so.

12:44.247 --> 12:46.264
All right, quitting time.

12:53.422 --> 12:55.014
<i> WOMAN (over phone):</i>

12:55.166 --> 12:57.500

12:59.521 --> 13:02.839

13:02.857 --> 13:05.599

13:05.693 --> 13:08.769
Damn, girl, where were you
when I was 24?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.513
-(phone chimes)
-Oh.

13:10.532 --> 13:12.198
All right, I'm gonna
go get my phone charger

13:12.367 --> 13:14.275
and see if the printer is done
with my picture of Barack.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.628
The one in the tan suit.
You know what's up.

13:16.779 --> 13:18.946
-(laughs)
-CARTER: Hey, Randi?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.615
I got a bunch of tile
for us to look at.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.051
Then again...

13:25.547 --> 13:28.197
She must have
left for work already.

13:28.216 --> 13:31.792
If Randi was my girl,
she'd never have to work.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.202
Like you could support a woman.

13:33.296 --> 13:36.055
Man, you're so broke,
your Venmo says "Ven-no."

13:36.207 --> 13:38.391
All I said was "if."

13:38.543 --> 13:39.967
You're mean.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.878
Hey, let's go.

13:41.896 --> 13:43.637
It's only a matter of time
before the customers realize

13:43.657 --> 13:45.281
we locked them in the bar.

13:47.735 --> 13:50.053
"Randi, you know
you too good for Carter."

13:50.055 --> 13:51.579
Ooh, Drake, I know.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.457
-(door closes)
-Mm.

13:57.562 --> 13:59.078
Oh, no.

13:59.230 --> 14:02.823
Hello? Hello?

14:02.843 --> 14:05.343
Oh, damn.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.254
Well, at least
I'm stuck here with you.

14:08.406 --> 14:10.014
(chuckles)

14:11.167 --> 14:13.059
This is not okurrr.

14:16.097 --> 14:17.430
-Nope.
-Look,

14:17.582 --> 14:18.690
I-I know you're mad.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.358
Please let me try
and make this right.

14:20.509 --> 14:21.751
I don't want to talk to you.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.403
Well, just hear me out.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.589
Also, try
not to look at my feet.

14:26.682 --> 14:28.867
I know these shoes
are as irresistible

14:29.018 --> 14:30.443
as they are
affordably comfortable.

14:30.595 --> 14:33.020
I think you're confusing
gay women's shoes

14:33.039 --> 14:35.081
with old people shoes.

14:36.801 --> 14:38.025
Make it fast.

14:38.119 --> 14:40.712
Well, first of all, no one
blames you for kissing me.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.438
It's these damn lips.

14:42.531 --> 14:43.940
I was actually
awarded Most Kissable

14:44.033 --> 14:47.093
at Jewish magic camp,
Camp Ezra Cadabra.

14:48.129 --> 14:49.870
Do you think this is funny?

14:49.964 --> 14:51.948
'Cause I couldn't sleep
last night.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.799
I haven't been in Louisville
a minute,

14:53.894 --> 14:55.560
and now two people I barely know

14:55.787 --> 14:59.713
and clearly can't trust
could out me and kill my career.

14:59.882 --> 15:01.232
We're not gonna out you.

15:01.384 --> 15:04.068
A-And also, people are so much
more accepting these days.

15:04.220 --> 15:07.647
Really? Name three country
music stars that are out.

15:07.799 --> 15:10.074
Uh... Brandi Carlisle,

15:10.226 --> 15:12.911
that guy from Brothers Osborne,

15:12.987 --> 15:15.988
um, and the cowboy
from the Village People.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.916
I'm pretty sure he's out.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.308
Exactly.

15:19.402 --> 15:21.144
And I know I shouldn't
have kissed you,

15:21.312 --> 15:22.903
you have a boyfriend,

15:22.923 --> 15:24.647
but when you spend your
whole life hiding who you are,

15:24.666 --> 15:27.425
at some point you're gonna make
an incredibly stupid mistake.

15:27.576 --> 15:31.745
Well, I... I wouldn't say
incredibly stupid.

15:32.507 --> 15:36.100
Please, Zoey, don't let
what happened between us

15:36.252 --> 15:38.436
mess things up for you and Max.

15:38.663 --> 15:40.605
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:40.832 --> 15:43.924
You can give this business
everything you got,

15:44.018 --> 15:45.610
and it's still
probably not gonna happen.

15:45.761 --> 15:49.072
Why the hell would I
make it harder on myself?

15:49.765 --> 15:51.616
Okay, you're right.

15:51.767 --> 15:55.102
And I will never know
what it's like to not feel safe

15:55.121 --> 15:57.622
sharing who I am with the world.

15:58.866 --> 16:03.369
But wouldn't it be nice
for you to work with one person

16:03.521 --> 16:06.506
who you know accepts you
for who you are?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.052
Just promise me
you'll think about it.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.641
And also, wouldn't it be fun
to occasionally

16:16.868 --> 16:20.228
crush it at karaoke with
a certain Tina Fey look-alike?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.723
(vocalizes "U Can't Touch This")

16:23.817 --> 16:26.150

16:46.731 --> 16:50.341
Are you a ghost? Have you been
a ghost this whole time?

16:50.418 --> 16:52.844
Oh, I knew you were
too hot for me.

16:53.071 --> 16:56.514
I'm stuck in a crawl space
behind the wall.

16:56.741 --> 16:58.908
-What? Where?
-Over here.

16:58.926 --> 17:01.410
Something's blocking me in.

17:01.412 --> 17:04.022
Oh, damn.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.933
I got you, baby.

17:08.086 --> 17:09.268
(straining)

17:09.362 --> 17:11.087
Oh, thank God.

17:11.105 --> 17:12.864
Oh, what's this?

17:13.015 --> 17:16.034
Oh, you got a secret clubhouse?

17:16.185 --> 17:18.352
Aw, hell no,
they get to be in the club?

17:18.371 --> 17:21.113
This is why my printer's
out of ink?

17:21.266 --> 17:23.207
When I was taking the paneling
off the wall,

17:23.359 --> 17:24.375
I found this little room,

17:24.568 --> 17:26.118
and I made into
a secret hideaway.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.378
Why didn't you tell me about it?

17:27.530 --> 17:29.863
Because I was hiding
away from you.

17:29.957 --> 17:31.549
Me? I'm adorable.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.718
Remember when I thought
you were a ghost?

17:33.945 --> 17:37.630
I love you, but this renovation
is driving me crazy.

17:37.782 --> 17:39.615
It's taking forever
and you keep changing your mind

17:39.708 --> 17:40.950
about every damn thing.

17:41.043 --> 17:42.635
I just want to
make our place perfect.

17:42.787 --> 17:43.953
Baby, I'm marrying you,

17:44.046 --> 17:46.380
obviously I don't care
about perfect.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.624
Look, even if we're not sure
about something,

17:48.717 --> 17:50.902
it's okay,
we can always change it later.

17:51.129 --> 17:52.461
That's true.

17:52.555 --> 17:54.739
You know, there is one thing
that I'm sure about.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.576
It's that I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

17:58.803 --> 18:00.486
Aw.
Me too, baby.

18:00.638 --> 18:01.728
-(chuckles)
-Just you,

18:01.748 --> 18:04.916
me and the blue cabinets
I originally wanted.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.084
Whatever you want.

18:06.235 --> 18:07.310
Although green is...

18:07.328 --> 18:10.296
-I said blue!
-Okay.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.006
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.916
I got you a Mexican pizza.

18:23.010 --> 18:25.010
And I know
you don't allow flowers

18:25.163 --> 18:26.604
because they are
poisonous to cats,

18:26.831 --> 18:29.348
but, uh, I just wanted to
get you something that says,

18:29.442 --> 18:32.026
"I'm sorry that
I was such a jackass."

18:35.873 --> 18:38.449
No cats were harmed
in the making of this apology.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.859
(Max chuckles)

18:39.953 --> 18:42.436
Zoey wants to work
with me again.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.937
That's great.

18:44.031 --> 18:47.625
And I know it's because you went
to see her, so thank you.

18:48.536 --> 18:49.702
Max, come sit down.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.538
Uh-oh, who'd you kiss now?

18:52.690 --> 18:54.549
(both chuckle)

18:56.527 --> 18:57.376
Are you okay?

18:57.528 --> 18:59.545
Not really.

18:59.697 --> 19:02.306
When you found out
about me and Zoey,

19:02.458 --> 19:04.550
the first thing you did
was run after her.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.218
Kind of felt like

19:06.312 --> 19:08.721
all you cared about
was your career.

19:08.873 --> 19:10.815
-That's not true.
-Really?

19:10.966 --> 19:13.634
'Cause you still
haven't asked me about it.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.046
Like, did it mean anything?
Is it gonna happen again?

19:17.139 --> 19:18.714
Did I like it?

19:18.733 --> 19:22.218
The answers: no, no, kind of.

19:22.311 --> 19:24.978
Again, jackass.
(chuckles)

19:24.998 --> 19:28.649
That's why there's $38
worth of flowers in the hallway.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.001
No, I-I get it.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.728
Like, you're happy that
things worked out, but...

19:32.821 --> 19:35.398
if Zoey didn't agree
to work with you again,

19:35.416 --> 19:37.508
would you still
be bringing me flowers?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.735
But it did work out,

19:39.904 --> 19:41.495
so what's the problem?

19:41.664 --> 19:44.348
I've just been thinking about
what you said about your career,

19:44.500 --> 19:47.018
you know, and, like...
how you don't really

19:47.169 --> 19:49.020
-have time for my feelings.
-All right,

19:49.247 --> 19:51.338
I... I got my priorities
messed up.

19:51.432 --> 19:53.766
Okay?
From now on, I am always

19:53.860 --> 19:55.100
-gonna put you first.
-Right,

19:55.253 --> 19:57.028
but if you do
and things don't work out,

19:57.179 --> 19:59.104
I kind of feel like
you're gonna blame me.

19:59.257 --> 20:00.256
I would never do that.

20:00.274 --> 20:01.257
No, but that's literally

20:01.275 --> 20:02.700
what you did yesterday.

20:02.777 --> 20:05.945
I know, and I said I'm sorry.

20:06.097 --> 20:07.446
I... What...

20:07.598 --> 20:10.291
What else do you want me to do
to fix this?

20:14.363 --> 20:16.672
I think that we should break up.

20:17.866 --> 20:18.699
What?

20:18.867 --> 20:21.260
Yeah.

20:22.463 --> 20:24.630
Kat. Come on.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.057
This is insane.

20:26.284 --> 20:28.184
No, it-it's really not.

20:31.547 --> 20:34.139
So, what, your mind
is just made up?

20:34.234 --> 20:37.293
You're not even gonna
talk about this?

20:37.386 --> 20:38.552
This is me talking about it,

20:38.571 --> 20:40.554
and I'm just telling you
that I've decided

20:40.573 --> 20:42.815
that this is what's best
for both of us.

20:42.967 --> 20:45.076
W... Oh, wow. I'm so...
I'm so glad

20:45.227 --> 20:48.246
that you have figured out
what is best for me.

20:48.397 --> 20:49.413
Thank you so much.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.624
-Okay, Max, you don't have...
-Whatever.

20:56.664 --> 20:57.946
(door opens)

20:57.948 --> 21:00.258
This is what's best for me.
