WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:02.936
Previously...

00:03.690 --> 00:05.108
We're leaving now, anyway.

00:05.108 --> 00:06.548
But it's 10:30.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.823
You said we'd come,
not that we'd stay.

00:08.798 --> 00:10.492
But thanks for paying
our electric bill.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.020
That was loud.

00:14.322 --> 00:16.173
I offered to pay

00:16.298 --> 00:18.541
gamma psi's electric bill.

00:18.666 --> 00:21.002
- Ashley didn't even know about it.
- That's not true.

00:21.127 --> 00:23.767
Dr. Larsen, I was hoping
you might be interested in

00:23.892 --> 00:26.368
sponsoring a project of mine.
- But I've already

00:26.493 --> 00:28.968
committed myself to
sponsoring dale kettlewell.

00:29.093 --> 00:32.308
I understand you turned down
an opportunity to work with Dr. Larsen.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.973
I'd rather take a chance working on my
own project, even if they call me anchor

00:36.098 --> 00:38.557
- until I graduate.
- I'll sponsor you.

00:38.682 --> 00:40.629
- This mean we're a team?
- This about Cappie?

00:40.754 --> 00:42.777
It's pretty clear
there are still feelings.

00:42.902 --> 00:45.231
How I feel about Cappie is
irrelevant since he's off

00:45.356 --> 00:47.041
with that night club girl.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.953
I guess I should explain why
I've been blowing you off.

00:50.078 --> 00:51.949
Are we still, or not?

00:52.281 --> 00:54.605
I want someone different.

00:57.456 --> 01:00.170
Your cab's here! You better hurry before
someone steals it!

01:00.295 --> 01:02.208
Out of my way, bitches!

01:02.746 --> 01:05.313
It's a four-day weekend,
you're not moving home.

01:05.438 --> 01:07.413
- Unless.
- Are you?

01:07.538 --> 01:10.160
Sorry to disappoint,
but I'll be back on sunday.

01:10.285 --> 01:12.666
You could pay me to stay longer but

01:12.791 --> 01:14.778
I don't have an electric bill.

01:14.903 --> 01:18.181
Are you going home Or back in time to
return that suitcaseto

01:18.306 --> 01:21.847
- to its rightful owner?
- I prefer the vintage look to the whole

01:21.972 --> 01:24.398
walking-advertisement
label-whore whore thing.

01:24.765 --> 01:27.568
But that's just me. Obviously.
And yeah, I'm going home.

01:27.693 --> 01:29.364
Thanksgiving at the cartwrights'.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.484
I'll bet it looks like
a norman rockwell painting.

01:31.609 --> 01:34.563
Hardly. I'll probably end up spending
the weekend with my old boyfriend.

01:35.413 --> 01:38.484
Old boyfriend? Sounds like
a home-for-the-holidays hook up to me.

01:38.609 --> 01:41.435
It's not like that. I just want see how
he's doing and catch up.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.424
Please. The only reason to catch up

01:43.549 --> 01:45.736
with an old flame,
when there's no flame.

01:46.121 --> 01:47.661
Is for sex.

01:47.786 --> 01:50.305
Just because you would,
doesn't mean I will.

01:50.430 --> 01:53.632
Right. Because you're the
good one, and I'm the bad one.

01:53.757 --> 01:55.159
Right.

01:56.207 --> 01:58.094
At least we agree on one thing.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.595
- Happy thanksgiving.
- You, too.

02:03.087 --> 02:05.271
I typed up the cooking
schedule for tomorrow,

02:05.396 --> 02:07.743
breaking it into two shifts,
which should give us equal time

02:07.868 --> 02:10.328
- to hit the lab working on projects.
- I'm not going to the lab.

02:10.946 --> 02:13.030
What about your special project?
And the grant?

02:13.833 --> 02:16.144
Proposals are due on
monday. Every minute counts.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.833
I hit a wall and hastings isn't the best
person to show me how to get over it.

02:20.555 --> 02:22.320
That's true. He's no larsen.

02:26.042 --> 02:27.587
What's up?

02:27.712 --> 02:29.746
- I'm double-parked. Are you ready?
- Go where?

02:29.871 --> 02:33.163
Our flight home that leaves in two
hours, please tell me you packed.

02:33.288 --> 02:36.801
We're not going anymore.
Mom and dad cancelled our tickets.

02:36.926 --> 02:39.756
- They're off to maui for the weekend.
- How do I not know this?

02:39.881 --> 02:42.079
She left you five messages!

02:42.349 --> 02:44.274
She didn't leave me any messages!

02:45.145 --> 02:47.279
Or, wait... Did she?

02:49.746 --> 02:51.453
Started skipping mom's
long voice-mails

02:51.578 --> 02:55.101
after she left one re-enacting
a health care debate on c-span.

02:55.226 --> 02:56.861
Now when I hear, "hey, case,

02:56.986 --> 02:59.276
it's mom," I skip it.

02:59.401 --> 03:02.102
- What a fun story.
- What about my message?

03:02.227 --> 03:04.024
I left you one, too.

03:07.377 --> 03:08.869
Just my luck!

03:08.994 --> 03:11.914
I can't believe this.
I was looking forward to seeing derrick.

03:12.039 --> 03:13.823
And mom and dad.

03:13.948 --> 03:16.920
Does that mean you'll be spending
thanksgiving dinner with us tomorrow?

03:17.045 --> 03:19.599
First one on our own.
Another big milestone.

03:19.973 --> 03:21.482
Might as well.

03:21.607 --> 03:23.672
I'm not going home now.

03:23.797 --> 03:25.493
What else have I got to do?

03:25.618 --> 03:28.164
OK, not the most
enthusiastic response,

03:28.289 --> 03:30.917
but I'll take it. I promise, anything
you coulda got at home,

03:31.042 --> 03:32.458
you'll get right here.

03:32.778 --> 03:34.648
I doubt that.

03:42.085 --> 03:43.660
You going home this weekend?

03:43.785 --> 03:45.928
My parents don't believe
in celebrating thanksgiving.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.053
They side with the native americans.

03:48.178 --> 03:50.476
And the turkey, as vegetarians.

03:50.884 --> 03:53.116
How about you? Going to the
chambers estate to discuss

03:53.241 --> 03:57.160
extramarital affairs, feuding families,
oil, and murder?

03:58.377 --> 04:00.366
You been watching dynastyon dvd?

04:00.491 --> 04:02.031
Dynasty?
Never heard of it.

04:02.343 --> 04:05.470
- Never mind.
- No, actually,

04:06.003 --> 04:09.552
I will not be going to the annual
chambers turkey extravaganza.

04:09.677 --> 04:12.774
I politely declined the e-mail
invite from my dad's secretary.

04:12.899 --> 04:14.937
If we're both here,
we should do something.

04:15.062 --> 04:17.330
- Maybe road trip to play some golf?
- Sounds good to me.

04:17.455 --> 04:19.121
We should go tomorrow.

04:19.246 --> 04:21.234
It's thanksgiving,
so the course'll be open.

04:21.359 --> 04:24.008
Or closed, which means
we play for free...

04:24.133 --> 04:26.308
Free... I can afford that.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.904
Wait... Tomorrow?

04:30.098 --> 04:31.585
I have the turkey hunt.

04:31.958 --> 04:33.501
It's this thing we do every year...

04:33.626 --> 04:35.925
One of the actives who's gone
for the weekend hides a turkey,

04:36.050 --> 04:38.381
leaving clues for the kts
who stuck around to follow.

04:38.506 --> 04:40.954
It's kind of a kt
thanksgiving tradition.

04:41.079 --> 04:43.597
Turkey hunt? Seriously?

04:43.765 --> 04:46.234
Aren't you getting a little
tired doing the same old stuff

04:46.359 --> 04:47.889
with those guys all the time?

04:48.186 --> 04:50.701
Come on, it's my first
thanksgiving away from home.

04:50.939 --> 04:53.152
Calvin and most of the other
omega chis are gone.

04:53.277 --> 04:54.647
Come on.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.254
Fine, they can do it
without me this year.

04:57.379 --> 04:58.974
When you get done with work?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.728
Sometime after lunch.
I'll give you a call when I know.

05:01.853 --> 05:03.626
And, I'll drive...

05:03.751 --> 05:05.157
Get it?

05:05.282 --> 05:07.596
That would've been funny
if you still had your car.

05:07.721 --> 05:10.142
- Yeah. You should drive.
- Yeah, I will.

05:11.376 --> 05:13.524
Rusty and I will handle
all the cooking,

05:13.649 --> 05:15.895
if you'd like to contribute,
bring a bottle of something.

05:16.020 --> 05:19.050
I think a dry ginger ale
might go best with deep-fried turkey.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.855
It's a kettlewell tradition.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.108
Sure is. Along with making
a wish on the wishbone.

05:23.233 --> 05:25.571
Wait, rusty and I do that
every year, too.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.083
It's a cartwright tradition.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.990
Considering how things've
been going in my love life,

05:30.115 --> 05:31.609
I could use the help.

05:31.734 --> 05:34.027
Why am I telling you this?

05:34.152 --> 05:35.303
I Miss ashleigh.

05:35.428 --> 05:36.839
You can have the wishbone,

05:36.964 --> 05:38.780
but you'll have to fight me
for the gizzard.

05:39.321 --> 05:40.928
It's all yours.

05:41.053 --> 05:43.282
Isn't this a little ambitious?

05:43.424 --> 05:46.620
I didn't stay in town to dilly-dally and
plan on getting some serious work done.

05:46.745 --> 05:48.155
Over a holiday weekend?

05:48.280 --> 05:51.373
Dale's applying for the
gary wyatt innovation engineering grant.

05:51.498 --> 05:53.751
Which could land me
40 gs to fund further research,

05:54.101 --> 05:56.062
and some serious bragging rights.

05:56.187 --> 05:59.170
I'm working on waste-printed
circuit board with my advisor.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.300
You might know him fromcharlie rose?

06:02.073 --> 06:04.769
Or from the cover of
the latest issue ofew?

06:05.389 --> 06:06.870
Engineering weekly?

06:07.552 --> 06:09.413
He was number two
on their "must list."

06:09.538 --> 06:11.643
Our project's one of
the top contenders.

06:11.768 --> 06:13.653
Are you applying, rus?

06:13.778 --> 06:16.589
No. It's fine. I get to concentrate
on more important matters,

06:16.714 --> 06:19.068
like our first thanksgiving
dinner without mom and dad.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.643
Yeah, without them
fighting over who gets

06:21.768 --> 06:23.899
to carve the turkey,
or who makes better gravy.

06:24.024 --> 06:26.909
If you Miss it, I can always nag
you on your bad table manners.

06:27.216 --> 06:28.216
Thanks.

06:34.486 --> 06:36.603
Hello? Anybody home?

07:16.822 --> 07:19.628
You really do think your life
is a romantic comedy, don't you?

07:21.439 --> 07:23.155
What are you doing home?

07:23.280 --> 07:26.064
Flight was cancelled, and
flying standby on thanksgiving

07:26.189 --> 07:28.095
depresses me.
What's your story?

07:28.418 --> 07:30.734
My parents ditched me for maui.

07:31.543 --> 07:33.422
So no booty call for casey?

07:33.547 --> 07:35.604
I told you, it wasn't a booty call.

07:35.729 --> 07:37.479
Right. My mistake.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.766
So were you texting,
emailing each other?

07:41.891 --> 07:44.489
How exactly did you
make the booty arrangement?

07:45.572 --> 07:47.589
I at least hope you had
the decency to cancel,

07:47.714 --> 07:49.500
so he can make other booty plans.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.499
Looks like it's just
the two of us this weekend.

07:55.306 --> 07:57.022
Just my luck.

08:04.130 --> 08:06.456
If you guys are interested,
dale and I are having

08:06.581 --> 08:08.465
thanksgiving dinner
at our apartment.

08:08.590 --> 08:10.425
Why would we find that interesting?

08:10.550 --> 08:12.306
Because I'm inviting
you guys to join.

08:13.487 --> 08:15.993
Sounds awesome. As long as
it's after the turkey hunt.

08:16.118 --> 08:17.932
You're hunting with us, right?

08:18.057 --> 08:21.068
I don't know. I have to cook,
and I should be thinking about

08:21.193 --> 08:24.615
my polymer science project but I'm so
far from the solution, it's pointless.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.582
How about you find
the turkey with us,

08:26.707 --> 08:29.243
and then we help with your
polygamy science project.

08:29.574 --> 08:31.980
Has anyone seen my pitching wedge?

08:32.105 --> 08:34.227
I left it here a few years ago.

08:34.596 --> 08:35.928
Thank you.

08:37.437 --> 08:39.967
What are you doing in town?
Thought you were going home.

08:40.092 --> 08:42.169
Our parents ditched us for Maui.

08:44.076 --> 08:45.559
Casey's still in town?

08:45.684 --> 08:48.071
She's coming over tomorrow
for Thanksgiving dinner.

08:48.196 --> 08:49.707
Dale and I are cooking.

08:49.832 --> 08:51.468
Maybe you should come.

08:52.804 --> 08:54.527
Tomorrow? Shoot.

08:54.652 --> 08:56.911
No, I wish I could.
I got this...

08:57.036 --> 09:00.442
Charity golf tournament thing...
For the poor.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.223
But what about the turkey hunt?

09:02.348 --> 09:04.196
Thanksgiving dinner.

09:04.934 --> 09:06.510
Next year,

09:06.635 --> 09:07.934
I promise.

09:08.822 --> 09:10.154
Combo shot...

09:11.392 --> 09:13.607
- you guys.
- Interference.

09:13.732 --> 09:15.095
Game over, I win.

09:15.569 --> 09:16.884
It was tied!

09:17.009 --> 09:19.540
Sure, it was, until cap
knocked in one of my balls.

09:22.276 --> 09:23.707
Combo shot.

09:24.387 --> 09:26.942
The electrons could pass
through a cross-linker!

09:27.067 --> 09:30.009
I gotta ask Dr. Hastings
if I can try a combo shot.

09:32.516 --> 09:33.697
Balls.

09:34.052 --> 09:36.839
You're right! I'm gonna tell
hastings I'm gonna try

09:36.964 --> 09:39.321
a combo shot,
whether he likes it or not.

09:42.901 --> 09:44.170
Yes, darling.

09:44.295 --> 09:47.253
I agree, your mother is insane.
Certifiable.

09:47.908 --> 09:50.330
We could leave her at
the nursing home this year.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.073
Of course i'm kidding!

09:53.198 --> 09:54.992
I'll pick her up on the way home.

09:56.284 --> 09:57.828
I have a student here now.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.613
Talk to you soon.

10:00.029 --> 10:01.144
What is it, cartwright?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.959
I think I know how to make
a self-healing polymer wire reconduct.

10:04.127 --> 10:05.203
That's not knowing.

10:05.286 --> 10:08.088
- How do you think it could happen?
- With a combo shot.

10:08.256 --> 10:09.256
Are you on drugs?

10:09.424 --> 10:12.259
We need to make the cross-linker
conductive, as well.

10:12.658 --> 10:13.969
That way, there will be more

10:14.137 --> 10:16.513
pathways for the current to travel.

10:18.195 --> 10:19.887
Certainly sounds plausible.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.478
But you haven't tested
this theory yet?

10:23.480 --> 10:25.522
Then why are you here?
Go try it!

10:25.690 --> 10:27.483
If it works, then I'll get excited.

10:28.033 --> 10:30.637
Then you might have a shot
at the Gary Wyatt grant.

10:33.568 --> 10:34.761
Really? You think so?

10:35.023 --> 10:38.004
Well, it is you we're talking about
here, so I won't hold my breat but

10:38.702 --> 10:40.159
if you do get lucky,

10:40.699 --> 10:43.040
even I may have to stop
calling you "anchor."

10:46.099 --> 10:48.247
But my friend's already going
for that grant.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.746
You think it's OK
that I try for it, too?

10:51.018 --> 10:53.218
There are no friends
in the lab, Cartwright.

10:53.987 --> 10:54.968
Remember that.

11:10.077 --> 11:11.149
Is that you?

11:31.755 --> 11:32.881
Stop doing that!

11:33.049 --> 11:36.093
It's creepy enough in this empty,
huge house without you stalking me.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.761
I keep hearing noises.

11:37.929 --> 11:39.988
It's an old house.
Things creak.

11:40.071 --> 11:43.216
I know! And I can sleep through
drunk singing in the hallways,

11:43.299 --> 11:46.019
or late-night Beyonce all the single
ladiesdance parties,

11:46.187 --> 11:48.387
<i>but it's like The Shining in here.</i>

11:50.081 --> 11:50.901
Red rum

11:52.319 --> 11:53.764
- Red rum.
- Please stop!

11:54.766 --> 11:58.323
Rusty did that once when he was six and
still swears he's never seen the movie.

12:00.054 --> 12:01.278
What are you doing?

12:01.745 --> 12:05.122
I thought I could spend the night here.
Keep you company while Ash is gone.

12:06.118 --> 12:06.857
No...

12:07.167 --> 12:08.130
... thanks.

12:10.806 --> 12:13.022
I guess you're not that good
of a person, after all.

12:13.105 --> 12:13.852
Fine.

12:14.252 --> 12:16.685
If a psycho axe murder
chops me up into little pieces,

12:16.768 --> 12:19.094
it's on your head,
which he'll probably chop off, too.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.943
OK, fine, fine!
You can stay.

12:22.026 --> 12:22.706
But...

12:23.493 --> 12:24.806
Just for tonight.

12:29.932 --> 12:32.437
- Brought your alarm clock?
- It's a rain machine.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.068
It's proven that white noise
helps you sleep more soundly.

12:35.776 --> 12:37.196
You can thank me later.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.438
You're up early.

12:51.664 --> 12:52.967
And wearing jeans?

12:53.244 --> 12:56.258
I'd recommend something
a little more elastic today.

12:56.914 --> 12:58.186
I'm heading to the lab.

12:58.572 --> 13:01.783
I think I know how to get my
self-healing polymer wire to reconduct.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.049
You weren't working on eco-polymers?

13:04.132 --> 13:06.595
I was, but this seems
more exciting to me.

13:06.956 --> 13:08.319
And here's the thing...

13:08.846 --> 13:12.270
If it works, Hastings thinks
I should go for the grant.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.396
My grant?

13:15.564 --> 13:16.522
It's not yours.

13:16.690 --> 13:18.440
- Well...
- I mean, not yet.

13:18.608 --> 13:21.402
Wanted to make sure it's OK with you
'cause I know you're going for it, too.

13:21.570 --> 13:22.903
We're both honors engineers.

13:23.192 --> 13:25.948
There aren't a lot of undergrad
grants going around.

13:26.116 --> 13:28.583
No, of course it's OK!
You're right.

13:29.043 --> 13:31.954
It's not mine. Not yet.
I haven't won it. Yet.

13:32.434 --> 13:33.300
I will.

13:33.383 --> 13:35.566
I mean, it's not like
you can call grant dibs.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.085
But if you can, I totally did.

13:40.413 --> 13:41.505
I'm just kidding.

13:41.673 --> 13:42.594
Go for it.

13:47.485 --> 13:49.230
You know what, I'll go with you.

13:49.971 --> 13:51.223
I padded that schedule.

13:51.391 --> 13:53.517
This way, we can cook together
when we get back, and...

13:53.885 --> 13:55.067
... be best friends.

13:55.412 --> 13:56.812
OK, let me get some clothes on.

14:01.249 --> 14:03.613
I think we should go back
to separate rooms tonight.

14:03.696 --> 14:05.551
You think?
You're the one with the

14:05.634 --> 14:07.429
rain machine and humidifier.

14:07.512 --> 14:09.281
And you snore like a beached seal.

14:09.364 --> 14:11.687
I rather take my chances
with an imaginary axe murder.

14:12.066 --> 14:15.865
Maybe I was snoring because of all the
humidity from tropical storm Rebecca.

14:18.198 --> 14:19.542
What are you up to today?

14:20.663 --> 14:22.431
Well, I'm volunteering

14:22.514 --> 14:24.258
with CRU's moveable feast.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.378
They deliver turkey dinners
to the elderly.

14:27.674 --> 14:30.808
I mean, things haven't exactly been
going my way lately.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.223
ZBZ's fourth.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.094
Ish.

14:33.492 --> 14:34.877
My parents ditched me.

14:35.061 --> 14:37.165
Still waiting for a decision
on that stupid

14:37.568 --> 14:39.085
board position from Katherine,

14:39.168 --> 14:41.315
and my dating life
is pretty much in the gutter.

14:41.483 --> 14:43.877
- The whole Cappie thing?
- I was talking about Derrick.

14:44.278 --> 14:46.694
But anyway, I've decided
to give back to the community

14:46.777 --> 14:50.282
in order to get some good karma
and hopefully reverse the trend.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.745
- How selfless of you.
- At least I'm doing something.

14:53.384 --> 14:54.662
I'm writing a check.

14:54.830 --> 14:56.288
How generous of you.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.040
For 10,000 dollars.

14:59.848 --> 15:01.478
That is generous.

15:02.832 --> 15:05.673
But if you really cared you'd invest
your time and not just your money.

15:06.028 --> 15:08.509
<i>I care about old people.
I watch Desperate Housewives.</i>

15:09.151 --> 15:11.302
And I can totally volunteer
with you today.

15:11.507 --> 15:12.680
I don't have any plans.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.059
I didn't mean today.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.647
I meant...

15:17.376 --> 15:18.433
in general.

15:18.957 --> 15:21.063
You're not the only one
who needs good karma.

15:24.978 --> 15:26.652
I've wondered,
with all those balloons,

15:26.820 --> 15:29.168
there's not one mischievous guy
with a pellet gun?

15:32.220 --> 15:33.319
It's almost noon!

15:33.540 --> 15:35.327
Let the turkey hunt begin!

15:35.495 --> 15:37.287
Here you go, Beav.
You get the first clue.

15:41.304 --> 15:44.412
"Take my cue,
this pool is too shallow for swimming,

15:44.495 --> 15:46.130
but does have deep pockets."

15:48.106 --> 15:49.299
We don't have a pool.

15:51.202 --> 15:52.428
Check your pockets!

15:53.028 --> 15:54.304
Wait, we don't have a pool,

15:54.472 --> 15:55.871
but we do have a hot tub.

15:56.222 --> 15:59.101
- The next clue's in the hot tub!
- No, guys, guys! Come on...

16:00.035 --> 16:00.784
Cue?

16:01.308 --> 16:02.999
Pockets? Pool?

16:03.220 --> 16:05.858
Don't you think you should check
the pockets at the pool table?

16:16.707 --> 16:17.634
Got it!

16:19.207 --> 16:20.456
Cap, you want to read?

16:20.624 --> 16:22.280
He can't.
He has golf with poor people.

16:22.363 --> 16:24.501
- Remember?
- Yeah, he has better things to do.

16:24.946 --> 16:27.713
Come on. Golf is slow, I'll just play
fast and catch up. Let me see the clue.

16:30.628 --> 16:32.479
"Smaller than a lion,
bigger than a mouse,

16:32.562 --> 16:35.345
I'm hiding under a trash can
in the smelliest room of the house."

16:35.513 --> 16:37.306
- Bathroom! - Kitchen!
- Could be anywhere.

16:38.776 --> 16:41.081
What filthy animal am I
staring at right now?

16:44.765 --> 16:45.588
Really?

16:45.750 --> 16:48.025
It's beaver!
The clue's in Beaver's room.

16:48.193 --> 16:50.648
You guys are terrible...
Whatever, let's find this turkey.

16:58.521 --> 17:00.655
I guess we weren't the only ones
with this idea.

17:01.881 --> 17:02.781
Excuse me.

17:04.117 --> 17:06.376
We're here to help deliver food
to old people.

17:06.928 --> 17:08.235
More volunteers.

17:08.771 --> 17:11.130
We always get so much help
on Thanksgiving.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.728
I think we have it covered now but

17:14.006 --> 17:17.167
you're welcome to volunteer
any of the other 364 days of the year.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.515
You deliver thanksgiving dinners
to the elderly year-round?

17:20.708 --> 17:23.352
They don't know what day it is,
they just want to eat.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.402
We'll totally do that.
We're just...

17:25.936 --> 17:27.856
feeling really charitable today.

17:28.024 --> 17:30.859
Join the club. If you'd really like
to help, write us a check.

17:36.832 --> 17:37.741
Oh, my God!

17:37.909 --> 17:38.941
Thank you!

17:39.398 --> 17:41.114
That is so generous!

17:43.733 --> 17:46.507
Looks like I'm the good one now.
And I'm good on karma through Christmas.

17:46.590 --> 17:47.706
How about you?

17:50.380 --> 17:51.903
Let's count it down. Ten...

17:53.031 --> 17:53.813
Nine...

17:54.722 --> 17:55.658
Eight...

17:59.934 --> 18:00.749
It works!

18:00.832 --> 18:02.891
- What happened? What works?
- The combo shot! Look!

18:04.222 --> 18:05.472
Why would you do that?

18:06.006 --> 18:08.030
If it turns back on, then it works.

18:08.523 --> 18:11.156
A conductive wire containing
self-healing microcapsules

18:11.239 --> 18:15.081
isn't a breakthrough, but a self-healing
reconductive one is grant-worthy.

18:15.488 --> 18:17.960
You think so? Because Rusty mentioned
earlier that a wire like that

18:18.043 --> 18:20.811
is still a ways off,
and we only have until monday so...

18:20.894 --> 18:23.620
Who is the nosy ninny?
And why does he know about our project?

18:23.788 --> 18:25.253
That's Dale. He's my friend.

18:25.336 --> 18:27.347
We were in your
physics class together.

18:29.222 --> 18:30.919
Listen to me closely, Cartwright.

18:31.087 --> 18:32.416
He is the enemy.

18:32.499 --> 18:35.199
Do not share any information
with other students.

18:35.590 --> 18:37.643
Keep your guard up.
I told you...

18:38.064 --> 18:40.470
There are no friends in the lab.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.560
What a grouch!

18:47.937 --> 18:50.747
Don't listen to that old has-been.
Don't let him push you around.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.403
He can't expect you to be finished
by monday, right?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.514
It's nearly impossible, right?

18:55.777 --> 18:57.821
Yeah, it would be pretty amazing.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.948
But all I can do is try.

19:00.116 --> 19:02.058
Exactly!
You might as well try.

19:05.749 --> 19:06.872
Dale. Your project.

19:07.039 --> 19:08.599
- It's good...
- Your project!

19:18.589 --> 19:20.385
Looks like you're sinking
with the anchor.

19:41.174 --> 19:42.414
I was so close.

19:43.101 --> 19:44.855
I could taste that stupid grant,
and now

19:44.938 --> 19:47.325
I gotta find a new circuit board
and start all over.

19:49.593 --> 19:50.797
Frank Stallone!

19:52.322 --> 19:56.052
Dale, I'm really sorry about that.
If there's anything you want me to do.

19:57.217 --> 19:58.430
Yeah. Go for Dale.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.408
Hello, Dr. Larsen.

20:00.850 --> 20:04.045
Yeah, well... Yes, sir,
we seem to have sailed

20:04.128 --> 20:05.646
into some rough waters.

20:06.395 --> 20:09.730
I've lost a couple days' work,
I don't know if there's time to...

20:10.992 --> 20:13.007
Yes sir, I do want the grant.

20:15.064 --> 20:16.571
Yes sir, I am a champion.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.325
<i>Yes sir, of course, I would like to be
on Charlie Rose someday. I don't...</i>

20:22.735 --> 20:23.453
Hello?

20:25.293 --> 20:28.335
<i>He really milks Charlie Rose
for all he's worth, doesn't he?</i>

20:28.503 --> 20:29.661
He sure does.

20:32.548 --> 20:33.791
Hey, it's on!

20:37.522 --> 20:39.471
- That's too bad.
- No, no, it's too good!

20:39.639 --> 20:41.915
It reconducted!
But it wasn't sustainable...

20:42.731 --> 20:44.051
Could be the battery.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.604
Or I might have to adjust
the cross-linker monomer ratio.

20:47.772 --> 20:48.963
That's great, Rus.

20:49.307 --> 20:52.128
So happy for you.
Yours didn't even catch on fire...

20:53.085 --> 20:54.365
which is awesome.

20:55.901 --> 20:57.688
It still doesn't work
like it should,

20:57.771 --> 20:59.407
but it's a small gain.

20:59.575 --> 21:01.618
I really don't appreciate your tone.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.454
I'm just fried.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.071
I'll start again tomorrow.

21:08.148 --> 21:09.317
See you at home.

21:17.757 --> 21:20.037
I'm telling you,
it has to be in my room.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.034
"The KT that gets the most box?"

21:22.117 --> 21:23.020
Look around.

21:23.246 --> 21:24.867
I think it's meant to be ironical.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.227
I don't know. I think
the next clue's in Cappie's room.

21:27.395 --> 21:30.311
I'm flattered, Wade.
But I think Heath may have a point.

21:31.051 --> 21:32.762
This is a lot of box.

21:32.845 --> 21:35.344
What gives?
You start a shipping business?

21:35.742 --> 21:38.484
I'm graduating in a few weeks.
Remember? I'm moving out.

21:38.567 --> 21:40.023
What? Hold up. Rewind.

21:40.870 --> 21:42.629
You're moving out? Graduating?

21:43.347 --> 21:45.837
- And there's no shipping business?
- You didn't know, Cap?

21:46.822 --> 21:48.290
I thought you knew everything.

21:48.821 --> 21:50.500
I'm so disillusioned right now.

21:50.668 --> 21:53.837
But we haven't even begun to organize
your going away party!

21:54.497 --> 21:56.336
Actually, we have.
It's next saturday.

21:57.258 --> 22:00.126
And if anyone's secretly gay
and wants to declare their love for me,

22:00.709 --> 22:01.849
now'd be the time.

22:03.056 --> 22:06.160
Sorry, Cap, but you haven't been around
much lately, so we took the initiative.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.341
Found it!

22:08.638 --> 22:10.923
"In the chambers
of the rich and pompous,

22:11.006 --> 22:13.607
where Tom Sawyer sits
and taunts us."

22:20.137 --> 22:21.238
It's at Omega Chi.

22:22.657 --> 22:25.794
"Chambers?" Evan chambers.
Jeez, you guys suck at this.

22:27.038 --> 22:29.247
We have to break into Omega Chi
for the next clue?

22:29.974 --> 22:31.070
Looks like we do.

22:31.542 --> 22:32.814
You're coming with us?

22:33.112 --> 22:34.586
What about your golf tournament?

22:44.096 --> 22:45.812
It was just cancelled, actually.

22:46.695 --> 22:49.100
Something about an unruly gopher
and explosives.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.452
And Heath, it's your last turkey hunt!
I'm sorry I almost missed it.

22:53.022 --> 22:54.284
Let me get my ski mask!

22:55.104 --> 22:56.975
Get ready,
I'll meet you guys out there.

23:01.651 --> 23:03.561
There's a canned food drive
at Dobler's.

23:03.644 --> 23:06.118
For every five cans donated,
you get two-for-one drinks.

23:06.817 --> 23:07.949
That was yesterday.

23:08.227 --> 23:09.031
What?

23:09.288 --> 23:12.709
- Looks like you do need good karma.
- Anything to get me out of this funk.

23:12.792 --> 23:13.875
I don't know.

23:14.271 --> 23:16.419
I really wanted to see Derrick
this weekend.

23:16.587 --> 23:18.318
So it was an interstate booty call!

23:18.401 --> 23:20.631
Fine. Yes. It totally was.

23:20.714 --> 23:23.427
And I probably still could've
gone home to see him,

23:23.510 --> 23:26.262
but when my parents bailed,
it suddenly felt...

23:26.430 --> 23:27.555
Super slutty?

23:28.061 --> 23:31.226
I was going to say "unnecessary",
but yeah, a little slutty.

23:32.461 --> 23:33.979
My flight didn't get cancelled.

23:34.557 --> 23:37.806
The more I thought about it, the more
I dreaded going home. So I didn't.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.694
So Derrick's that good, huh?

23:41.545 --> 23:42.654
I've had better.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.839
Like who?
Cappie or Evan?

23:45.535 --> 23:47.534
- I'm not going to answer that.
- What about Evan?

23:50.495 --> 23:52.268
- Did you guys say my name?
- Yeah.

23:52.351 --> 23:53.840
I saw you coming.

23:54.271 --> 23:55.732
I mean... I said,

23:56.169 --> 23:58.169
"Hey, here comes Evan".

23:58.252 --> 24:00.755
- So what are you up to?
- And why do you smell like yams?

24:02.320 --> 24:03.342
I was working.

24:03.425 --> 24:05.973
And then I had plans with a friend,
but he flaked so

24:06.346 --> 24:07.218
here I am.

24:07.462 --> 24:08.603
Walking home alone.

24:09.670 --> 24:10.861
You're not alone now.

24:11.267 --> 24:14.185
You should come to dinner
with me at Rusty's apartment.

24:14.549 --> 24:17.063
- I doubt he wants me there.
- It's Thanksgiving.

24:17.231 --> 24:20.316
I'll just call and tell him
to add another place setting.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.110
You invite Evan, but not me?

24:22.799 --> 24:25.139
I assumed you wouldn't want to go.

24:25.222 --> 24:27.449
- Would you?
- I would. Thank you for the invite.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.552
You're stirring way too fast.

24:36.635 --> 24:39.193
If we wanted a stuffing smoothie
I'd throw it in the blender.

24:43.283 --> 24:45.967
You sure about setting up
that deep-fryer on the porch?

24:46.129 --> 24:47.508
That doesn't seem safe,

24:47.974 --> 24:48.970
like, at all.

24:49.138 --> 24:51.681
I know what I'm doing.
Never had a turkey go up in flames.

24:52.246 --> 24:53.892
I don't plan on it happening today.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.338
How much celery is in there?
You even bother to measure?

25:02.421 --> 25:04.461
Sort of.
It looks fine to me.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.905
Don't you understand
the importance of precision?

25:07.604 --> 25:09.410
Because, yeah, it may look fine,

25:09.493 --> 25:12.217
but then you realize
you underclocked the cpu so much,

25:12.300 --> 25:15.397
that your processor is useless
spinning at such a low speed.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.291
Wait a minute. I thought we were talking
about the stuffing, not your project.

25:18.453 --> 25:20.992
We are.
But the stuffing or my project,

25:21.075 --> 25:22.587
you have to be precise!

25:22.759 --> 25:25.573
If you want, maybe tomorrow
I can help you get back on track?

25:25.895 --> 25:27.129
I can do it on my own.

25:30.704 --> 25:32.097
Are these cranberries?

25:32.265 --> 25:34.307
These are!
There's no cranberries in the recipe!

25:35.643 --> 25:38.770
That's it! Thanksgiving's ruined!
I'm going to the lab.

25:38.922 --> 25:40.884
- What about dinner?
- Dinner's cancelled!

25:43.764 --> 25:45.037
Dinner's cancelled!

25:46.873 --> 25:48.363
I guess dinner's cancelled.

25:49.271 --> 25:51.231
What are we supposed to do
for dinner now?

25:52.705 --> 25:53.780
I've got an idea.

25:54.318 --> 25:56.712
We pretend
like we're delivering them,

25:56.917 --> 25:58.873
but we keep a few meals
for ourselves.

25:59.773 --> 26:01.718
That's serious bad karma.

26:01.801 --> 26:03.336
Yeah, that won't be happening.

26:07.591 --> 26:08.725
I have an idea.

26:08.808 --> 26:11.462
Look at all these people
with nowhere to go.

26:11.545 --> 26:13.847
Let's have Thanksgiving
at the ZBZ house!

26:14.446 --> 26:15.807
And everyone's invited!

26:16.474 --> 26:17.735
It's gonna be so great.

26:17.893 --> 26:20.798
OK, guys, we're gonna have Thanksgiving
at the ZBZ house!

26:30.326 --> 26:31.451
Microwave pizza?

26:31.804 --> 26:34.455
It's turkey sausage.
Happy Thanksgiving. Next!

26:36.161 --> 26:37.623
What's in this stuff, anyway?

26:38.625 --> 26:40.359
This is cranberry juice

26:40.527 --> 26:43.013
and an assortment of half-empty bottles
I got from catering.

26:43.096 --> 26:44.614
I call it "cranberry sauce".

26:48.734 --> 26:50.859
Is Cappie in town?
We should ask him over.

26:50.942 --> 26:51.918
There you go.

26:52.929 --> 26:54.547
He's the flake I had plans with.

26:55.135 --> 26:57.793
- Is he with Lana or something?
- No, they broke up.

26:58.238 --> 26:59.214
They did?

26:59.297 --> 27:02.012
But you know Cappie, he's probably
got drunk with the KTs and

27:02.095 --> 27:04.806
skeet shooting dinner plates,
skateboarding off the roof,

27:04.889 --> 27:06.694
or something stupid like that.

27:26.815 --> 27:28.375
Check under all the chairs.

27:33.134 --> 27:34.355
It's still cold!

27:34.438 --> 27:35.662
Someone was just here.

27:37.325 --> 27:39.341
Where Tom Sawyer sits.

27:39.637 --> 27:40.483
Good one.

27:45.650 --> 27:47.607
- I found it. Let's get outta here.
- Wait.

27:47.863 --> 27:49.512
We have to pull a prank, right?

27:49.865 --> 27:53.224
- Yeah, let's saran wrap the toilets.
- No, let's steal all their underwear.

27:56.287 --> 27:59.139
Let's do something to Chambers's room.
You guys have any eggs on you?

27:59.222 --> 28:01.479
Or rancid trout?
Anyone need to pee?

28:13.543 --> 28:16.205
No one's doing anything to Evan's room!
Let's get out of here.

28:17.012 --> 28:20.033
- What's up with you lately?
- You don't want to prank the OCs?

28:20.457 --> 28:22.044
It's, like, bizarro Cappie!

28:22.212 --> 28:23.501
There's no pranking today.

28:23.584 --> 28:25.702
It's not me, it's in the KT by-laws.

28:25.785 --> 28:28.718
"On thanksgiving day,
all KTs must adhere to

28:28.886 --> 28:31.889
a brief suspension of hostility
in the spirit of the holiday."

28:31.972 --> 28:34.248
It even suggests we invite
our enemies over to

28:34.331 --> 28:36.600
watch football or...
Or skateboard off the roof.

28:36.768 --> 28:39.103
KTs and OCs will never get along.
We're too different.

28:39.271 --> 28:41.409
You don't want to screw
with Evan Chambers?

28:41.863 --> 28:44.137
The guy who hit Spitter
with his own pledge paddle?

28:44.629 --> 28:46.235
The guy who stole your girlfriend?

28:46.376 --> 28:47.642
It was a long time ago.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.663
I had the opportunity
to be with her, and I...

28:49.746 --> 28:52.214
- I didn't want to risk it.
- You didn't want to risk it?

28:52.696 --> 28:54.656
Seriously, what's going on
with you, Cap?

28:54.739 --> 28:56.401
You used to live for risk.

28:57.010 --> 28:58.274
And chutes and ladders.

28:58.357 --> 28:59.712
All I'm saying is...

29:00.457 --> 29:02.334
Why would I want to go
through all that again?

29:03.007 --> 29:04.633
To be with the love of your life?

29:13.715 --> 29:15.473
Come on,
let's just get out of here, OK?

29:31.063 --> 29:32.823
Aren't you supposed to be at dinner?

29:33.363 --> 29:36.744
I left for more brown sugar,
and unfortunately, I had car trouble.

29:37.101 --> 29:37.915
Really?

29:38.914 --> 29:41.248
I'm changing my tire as we speak.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.751
What happened to dinner
with your friend?

29:43.948 --> 29:45.795
Cancelled it to keep working.

29:46.869 --> 29:49.548
You know,
I had a friend like yours once.

29:50.004 --> 29:52.925
We pioneered the work that led
to the miniaturized hard disk.

29:53.940 --> 29:55.573
However, without my knowledge,

29:55.656 --> 29:59.475
my friend published a book about
our research and forgot to credit me.

30:00.504 --> 30:02.061
He went on to make millions,

30:02.229 --> 30:04.980
win the Pulitzer, and marry
a Victoria's secret model.

30:07.563 --> 30:09.025
No friends in the lab?

30:09.736 --> 30:11.384
You're going after the same result.

30:12.449 --> 30:13.781
You can't both win.

30:19.527 --> 30:23.027
I've been getting along with her
for two solid hours now.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.138
Must be the spirit of the holiday.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.476
You know, it could be
the cranberry sauce.

30:28.956 --> 30:30.752
That helps, too.

30:31.504 --> 30:35.701
Sure you don't want to call cap? I love
that the three of us are friends again.

30:35.826 --> 30:36.992
It's like old times.

30:37.702 --> 30:39.080
These people don't know yet...

30:39.205 --> 30:42.567
Well, maybe the omega chis
and kts should embrace

30:42.692 --> 30:45.323
the spirit of the holiday
a little, too.

30:46.534 --> 30:47.787
I need a refill. You good?

30:51.858 --> 30:53.403
Were you two just talking about me?

30:54.431 --> 30:55.842
Paranoid much?

30:56.241 --> 30:58.732
What did he say? Did he see me
talking to that cute guy?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.537
- Think it made him jealous?
- What's going on with you?

31:01.705 --> 31:03.593
- Nothing.
- Hey, check it out!

31:05.108 --> 31:06.792
Hey! You're not allowed up there!

31:07.313 --> 31:09.530
- That's my roommate's shirt!
- I'm on it!

31:11.173 --> 31:12.840
I think it's time we close
the kitchen.

31:13.726 --> 31:16.510
All right, everybody, listen up!
Thank you for coming,

31:16.987 --> 31:19.927
but we are now closed,
so be careful out there.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.250
Happy thanksgiving.

31:33.351 --> 31:34.580
What are you doing?

31:37.066 --> 31:38.229
I was just curious.

31:39.461 --> 31:42.815
Going through my notes?
Spying on me? That's cheating.

31:43.550 --> 31:44.498
And unethical,

31:44.939 --> 31:46.081
at the very least.

31:46.249 --> 31:49.970
Our projects are nothing alike.
I just wanted to see how close you were.

31:50.095 --> 31:51.761
You should take this as a compliment

31:52.215 --> 31:56.342
'cause I saw you making progress
and realized you're real competition.

31:56.809 --> 31:59.345
What does that mean?
I wasn't competion before?

32:00.951 --> 32:02.261
You know, you're the anchor.

32:03.914 --> 32:06.467
You actually think that little
of me? You think I'm that bad?

32:07.496 --> 32:09.032
I don't think you're bad,

32:09.346 --> 32:11.678
I thought your project might've
been a little ambitious.

32:11.803 --> 32:15.373
I've looked at you like a friend and
you've looked down on me like the anchor

32:17.792 --> 32:19.342
It's just a nickname!

32:21.453 --> 32:22.683
It's just a nickname!

32:26.097 --> 32:30.120
It looks like all he took was
that one shirt. What an odd choice.

32:31.362 --> 32:33.379
It's funny, I thought I'd
be spending tonight alone.

32:35.188 --> 32:37.549
I thought I'd be spending it
with an old boyfriend.

32:40.012 --> 32:41.308
Cranberry sauce.

32:44.032 --> 32:45.060
Old boyfriend?

32:57.906 --> 33:00.057
I thought all I wanted was
a booty call,

33:00.939 --> 33:02.690
but I realize now I want...

33:03.772 --> 33:04.535
... more.

33:05.335 --> 33:06.965
I know exactly what you're saying.

33:08.415 --> 33:09.744
No, I... I mean...

33:11.856 --> 33:12.650
Us

33:13.152 --> 33:15.330
In general. No offense.

33:15.455 --> 33:17.875
What? No... None taken.

33:19.783 --> 33:21.817
Yeah, I knew what
you meant. In general.

33:24.764 --> 33:27.207
I chased him three blocks before
I realized we're doing Ash a favor

33:27.290 --> 33:28.659
by letting him keep the shirt.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.196
Anyone else hungry?

33:30.743 --> 33:32.561
So busy being charitable,
I forgot to eat.

33:33.734 --> 33:38.560
I just got a text from rusty, inviting
us to thanksgivingat the kt house.

33:38.643 --> 33:39.870
Great! Let's go.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.094
The kt house?

33:41.452 --> 33:42.841
What are you doing on the roof?

33:42.741 --> 33:44.335
Don't worry, i'll protect you.

33:57.433 --> 34:00.523
Scooter, what are you doing on the roof?

34:01.241 --> 34:02.958
Not much. Just thinking.

34:03.927 --> 34:05.517
This is definitely the spot
for that.

34:06.295 --> 34:07.676
I do my best thinking up here.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.710
Just gotta watch out for bird poo.

34:13.564 --> 34:14.994
Heard you guys found the turkey.

34:15.501 --> 34:17.827
It's being prepared for
the big feast as we speak.

34:18.054 --> 34:20.018
Sorry we had to cancel
dinner at our apartment.

34:20.352 --> 34:22.103
Don't worry.
I know you and Dale are busy.

34:23.549 --> 34:24.833
What's going on with you?

34:27.132 --> 34:30.212
It kinda involves, your sister, so

34:30.957 --> 34:32.373
I don't know if you. It's fine.

34:32.456 --> 34:35.364
Pretend like she's not my sister.
Pretend like she's some other girl.

34:36.823 --> 34:39.950
See? That's the thing. She's not just
some other girl.

34:41.333 --> 34:42.375
At least not to me.

34:43.284 --> 34:46.250
I had the opportunity to
be with her, and my "friend"...

34:47.921 --> 34:49.017
talked me out of it.

34:49.284 --> 34:51.823
Maybe this friend doesn't have
your best interests in mind.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.453
Maybe he's just looking out for
himself.

35:04.214 --> 35:05.603
i'm working on this project...

35:07.862 --> 35:09.105
I'm making progress.

35:09.567 --> 35:10.468
I mean, the...

35:11.402 --> 35:12.257
Bulb lit up.

35:13.615 --> 35:14.417
Briefly...

35:16.314 --> 35:17.383
But it's something.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.056
It involves this wire

35:21.058 --> 35:22.524
that heals itself.

35:22.940 --> 35:25.612
This wire can get cut, but
it just keeps growing back.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.554
It could get cut over and over again,
and just keeps growing back.

35:31.456 --> 35:32.872
It does not give up.

35:38.699 --> 35:39.701
Neither will i.

35:42.386 --> 35:44.457
No matter how many times
they call me the anchor.

35:50.270 --> 35:51.726
So what are you gonna do?

35:56.283 --> 35:58.675
I'm gonna have thanksgiving
dinner with my brothers.

36:08.949 --> 36:11.782
He's not coming inside. We don't
care if it's thanksgiving.

36:12.273 --> 36:14.130
It's not a big deal. I can just go.

36:14.492 --> 36:16.001
Can you help us out here?

36:16.084 --> 36:17.471
What seems to be the issue?

36:17.685 --> 36:19.803
They won't let our guest in.

36:20.371 --> 36:23.682
No OC is stepping foot in this house
without getting pounded...

36:25.124 --> 36:26.142
...by my fist.

36:27.382 --> 36:29.520
- In the face! I don't know...
- Look, guys.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.590
If the pilgrims and indians can set
aside their differences for one meal...

36:34.085 --> 36:36.169
- Can't we?
- And he brought a peace offering

36:36.252 --> 36:38.120
that's much better than corn...

36:39.657 --> 36:41.341
You know what? If...

36:42.383 --> 36:44.828
the cowboys and indians can do it,
you know, so can we.

36:46.135 --> 36:47.205
Come on in.

36:52.788 --> 36:53.857
Sorry I bailed.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.327
Turkey better be good.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.857
Which one of these looks
more like an anchor?

37:16.545 --> 37:19.966
As we near the end of our meal,
i'd like to propose a toast.

37:21.282 --> 37:24.416
And no toast would be
complete without... The turkey!

37:24.785 --> 37:26.119
Finally, some real food.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.902
It's not that kind of turkey.

37:30.374 --> 37:33.715
To the success of yet another
turkey hunt! Kts for life!

37:40.170 --> 37:42.321
You know, some people
can't pull it off

37:43.767 --> 37:46.181
...but I bet you'd look
really good with a shaved head.

37:47.175 --> 37:48.230
Maybe I should go.

37:49.973 --> 37:52.966
You shave him, I shave you, beaver.

37:56.234 --> 37:59.486
Come on, rus. It's a Cartwright
tradition. Make a wish.

38:06.770 --> 38:10.258
Shoot. I was hoping for some
good luck with my project,

38:10.341 --> 38:12.290
so I can destroy my competition.

38:13.027 --> 38:14.459
Should probably go work on it.

38:15.807 --> 38:18.046
I think I should get going, too.

38:18.214 --> 38:19.547
I'll walk you home.

38:20.497 --> 38:21.216
Thanks.

38:22.114 --> 38:23.263
See you at the house.

38:28.929 --> 38:30.934
Thanks for having me, guys.
This was really fun.

39:09.028 --> 39:12.650
Thanks for the walk home.
I think I can take it from here.

39:14.988 --> 39:16.124
How about a nightcap?

39:20.729 --> 39:22.332
No, I meant... I mean...

39:25.780 --> 39:28.800
Wow, it must really be scary
being the only one here.

39:31.611 --> 39:33.535
No boys allowed upstairs.

39:33.618 --> 39:34.497
Wait, wait...

39:39.347 --> 39:40.843
There's something I need to say.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.543
I've been thinking...
About...

40:12.548 --> 40:13.411
Stuff.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.535
Really? Me too. Like, should
I get my hair colored?

40:17.564 --> 40:19.034
Would I look good as a brunette?

40:20.905 --> 40:22.843
I think you'd look
gorgeous with any color.

40:23.992 --> 40:24.887
Good to know.

40:25.911 --> 40:26.633
Thanks.

40:27.314 --> 40:28.905
So anyway...

40:32.553 --> 40:33.902
You... You've been thinking.

40:36.409 --> 40:38.454
I was thinking, um...

40:39.876 --> 40:41.159
I was just...

40:42.386 --> 40:43.789
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

40:48.373 --> 40:50.083
I really wish things
worked out with us.

40:54.143 --> 40:55.707
That was my wish, too.

41:05.186 --> 41:06.440
Dale! Hey, I got it...

41:12.547 --> 41:13.590
I got it to work.

41:17.966 --> 41:19.008
So your wish?

41:21.561 --> 41:25.526
Is that what you wished for
on your wish... Pretzel?

41:27.750 --> 41:30.905
You know, I'm sorry, I've been drinking.
Um, let's just talk tomorrow, ok?

41:31.073 --> 41:32.213
No, let's talk now.

41:38.866 --> 41:41.525
I poured my heart out to you
at the end of the world party,

41:41.608 --> 41:43.637
and you didn't come after me.

41:45.118 --> 41:46.494
You should've come after me.

41:48.512 --> 41:49.233
I know.

41:50.663 --> 41:51.973
And I have no excuse.

41:54.748 --> 41:56.556
But I'm here now.
And I'm telling you...

41:56.724 --> 41:58.043
Telling me what?

42:11.334 --> 42:13.071
I want to try us again.

42:17.457 --> 42:18.687
I want to be with you.

42:22.549 --> 42:24.139
I want to be with you, too.
