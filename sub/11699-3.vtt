00:00.791 --> 00:03.560
All right, madam, you've
sent back the peas, carrots,

00:03.594 --> 00:06.816
and even the chef's special,
peas and carrots.

00:07.836 --> 00:09.165
That's right.

00:09.166 --> 00:12.398
Now I hate to say this to my customers,
but you're kind of being a baby.

00:13.939 --> 00:15.807
Hey, will you two
keep it down?

00:15.808 --> 00:18.843
Danny Wheeler is officially
on sale at the NHL store.

00:18.877 --> 00:21.646
Dude, this is the tenth time
you've called. Have you no dignity?

00:21.681 --> 00:25.192
I'm dignified.
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

00:25.985 --> 00:28.012
I am <i>zee</i> French tourist.

00:28.013 --> 00:30.922
Do you have <i>zee</i> Danny Veeler
jersey in <i>stockee?</i>

00:32.658 --> 00:34.075
Sure, I'll hold.

00:34.708 --> 00:39.146
Okay. Does this suit say strong,
successful TV producer?

00:39.147 --> 00:41.726
Yeah, it does.
So why are you wearing it?

00:42.702 --> 00:45.737
Because I am only
one great idea away

00:45.771 --> 00:48.807
from being bumped up to producer
on "The Mary Hart Show."

00:48.841 --> 00:51.543
Look, yesterday,
I was walking down the hall.

00:51.577 --> 00:55.587
Mary came out of her dressing room,
stopped, looked straight at me.

00:55.588 --> 00:58.248
- What'd she say?
- Nothing. She just kept walking to set.

00:59.287 --> 01:01.820
But the point
is she stopped.

01:02.564 --> 01:04.735
Dude, I'm a Mary-stopper.

01:05.909 --> 01:07.801
Yes, I'm still here.

01:08.535 --> 01:13.048
Really? That's awesome!
I mean, <i>zhat's awesome!</i>

01:13.499 --> 01:15.038
My jersey's sold out!

01:15.039 --> 01:18.823
Coming through! Pay no attention
to the ass in your doorway.

01:18.824 --> 01:21.442
Mom! Mom, I have fans,
real fans.

01:21.443 --> 01:24.195
Yeah, well, could you turn them on?
I'm sweating through my good bra.

01:24.197 --> 01:26.683
No, no, no.
My jersey is sold out.

01:26.684 --> 01:28.735
Ah, I got to tell Riley.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.615
What's up
with the old bag?

01:34.420 --> 01:37.722
I am of course
referring to the duffel.

01:38.226 --> 01:41.161
Tucker, you look adorable.

01:41.179 --> 01:43.964
Your school pictures
are gonna turn out great.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.301
Riley's not answering.

01:51.335 --> 01:53.269
Damn it, Ben.
I knew it.

01:53.304 --> 01:55.394
I knew you were gonna
mess things up with her.

01:55.395 --> 01:57.396
I'm just like
that psychic on the corner,

01:57.414 --> 02:00.282
except I wear pants and I'm not
married to the fire hydrant.

02:01.195 --> 02:03.502
- I'm gonna go check on her.
- Hey, what about me?

02:03.503 --> 02:05.237
'Cause nobody's asking
if I'm okay.

02:05.238 --> 02:07.468
Because I'm not.
I'm the one who got dumped.

02:07.469 --> 02:09.475
Oh, sweetie,
we are all so concerned.

02:09.476 --> 02:12.405
But is he gone? Okay.
All right, okay.

02:12.406 --> 02:16.248
You guys have got to help me
unload these things.

02:19.486 --> 02:22.588
You bought all
of Danny's jerseys?

02:22.606 --> 02:25.858
Where you when I was selling
homemade taquitos?

02:27.561 --> 02:29.898
All right, Danny's contract
is coming up.

02:29.899 --> 02:33.181
And nothing says "Cut me from the team"
like a bunch of unsold T-shirts.

02:33.182 --> 02:35.880
Mom, Danny's an adult.
Just tell him the truth.

02:35.881 --> 02:39.138
- We're Wheelers. We can handle it.
- Really, Ben?

02:39.785 --> 02:41.569
You want the truth?

02:41.620 --> 02:43.055
<i>Okay.</i>

02:43.658 --> 02:47.360
You never sold one tube
of wrapping paper.

02:47.361 --> 02:49.149
Your lemonade stand sucked.

02:49.150 --> 02:51.746
And when you finally graduated
from junior high,

02:51.747 --> 02:55.583
it wasn't because you were good at math.
It was because I was good at flirting.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.708
I lie to you boys
to protect you.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.678
It's called being a parent.
Okay, get used to it.

Season 3, Episode 3
"Lights! Camera! No Action!"

03:19.882 --> 03:22.581
Danny, for the last time,
I'm fine.

03:22.839 --> 03:24.773
Why wouldn't you think I'm fine?
I'm fine!

03:25.070 --> 03:26.988
Riley, I've known you
my entire life.

03:27.022 --> 03:29.023
And whenever you get upset,
you stress-eat.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.025
Well, obviously, you don't
know me at all

03:31.026 --> 03:33.395
because this is
stress-baking.

03:33.729 --> 03:36.115
You know?
And there's a big difference

03:36.185 --> 03:40.001
'Cause in the past, I mean,
I would have eaten all of these,

03:40.035 --> 03:42.003
but now I just take a bite...

03:42.856 --> 03:44.655
Of each one.

03:47.692 --> 03:50.343
It has been 36 hours
and not one call.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.244
I mean, why hasn't he called,
Danny? Why?

03:52.279 --> 03:54.396
Maybe it's because
you told him not to.

03:54.397 --> 03:56.916
Um, I'm a woman.
I didn't mean it.

03:57.952 --> 04:01.858
I mean, you don't get over
a lifetime of love in 36 hours.

04:05.339 --> 04:07.846
And if he did love me,
he'd be here right now.

04:07.854 --> 04:10.014
I mean, he'd fight for me,
right?

04:10.015 --> 04:13.346
I would've.
I mean, he should've.

04:14.301 --> 04:16.218
You know what
I need to do?

04:16.524 --> 04:18.254
I need to move on.

04:18.305 --> 04:19.471
You know what?
That's it.

04:19.505 --> 04:21.774
I am moving on.
I am done with Ben Wheeler.

04:21.774 --> 04:22.875
- Really?
- Really.

04:22.876 --> 04:24.984
Oh my God,
this one looks like him.

04:28.648 --> 04:30.583
One sock.

04:30.584 --> 04:32.268
And number two.

04:32.269 --> 04:33.393
- No! No.
- Why?

04:33.394 --> 04:34.685
No, I am not wearing
this to work.

04:34.686 --> 04:37.237
And I am not booking Danny on the show.
He's not famous enough.

04:37.238 --> 04:39.122
Hey, I have seen
"The Mary Hart Show."

04:39.182 --> 04:41.823
- You don't always have celebrities.
- Yes, we do.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.951
Okay, what about that monkey
you had on yesterday?

04:43.952 --> 04:46.661
- He can drive a car!
- Yeah, well, so can Danny!

04:46.662 --> 04:48.913
- A stick shift?!
- Well, he can learn!

04:51.434 --> 04:53.573
And that's why
I put you in day care.

04:53.609 --> 04:56.596
Oh, Ben, I keep forgetting to tell you.
I got a lead on an apartment.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.839
So it looks like I'll finally
be getting off your couch.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.949
Hey, that's great. Hey, let me call
Riley and tell her the great news.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.413
Oh wait,
she's not talking to me.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.005
Ben, I'm so sorry if I had anything
to do with you and Riley breaking up.

05:08.006 --> 05:11.742
You know, some people would say
you had everything to do with it.

05:11.743 --> 05:13.430
And I happen to be
one of those people.

05:13.431 --> 05:15.516
Well, I still think it would
make our daughter happy

05:15.517 --> 05:16.998
if we at least
gave it a shot.

05:17.032 --> 05:19.448
Angela, we're not
playing house here.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.383
You don't even know where you're
gonna be in the next month.

05:21.384 --> 05:23.625
But that's just it.
I'm ready to stay.

05:23.626 --> 05:25.493
In fact, I was offered
a big part in L.A.

05:25.494 --> 05:27.628
and I already told my agent
I'm not interested.

05:27.663 --> 05:29.431
Maybe you don't see it,

05:29.465 --> 05:32.221
but I think we have the makings
of a pretty nice little family.

05:32.222 --> 05:34.000
Oh, I see plenty.

05:34.131 --> 05:35.813
No, seriously,
go put some clothes on.

05:37.740 --> 05:40.409
And they're super absorbent.

05:40.443 --> 05:42.461
Huh?
Voila! Huh?

05:42.512 --> 05:43.900
- Here, take it.
- Hey.

05:43.901 --> 05:46.348
I did it.
I actually did it.

05:46.382 --> 05:49.717
Well, so did I last Tuesday, but I'm
not running around bragging about it.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.521
No, no.

05:52.555 --> 05:56.001
I talked to Mary Hart and I convinced
her to book Danny on the show.

05:56.002 --> 05:58.653
Tucker!
Thank you!

06:05.936 --> 06:07.920
Um, yeah.

06:07.928 --> 06:09.736
- That's never happening again.
- No.

06:09.793 --> 06:11.377
So... so how
did you do it?

06:11.407 --> 06:12.624
Oh my God,
you should have seen me.

06:12.658 --> 06:14.226
- I was amazing.
- Yeah.

06:14.227 --> 06:16.816
A guest canceled, so I asked
if I can book Danny.

06:16.817 --> 06:18.446
She said, "Whatever,
don't talk to me."

06:18.464 --> 06:21.143
- And then that was it. Done.
- Yes.

06:23.619 --> 06:25.635
It's like a Danny Wheeler
fan club in here.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.737
Hey, everyone,
it's me.

06:29.509 --> 06:33.327
Okay, sweetie, you don't
want to cause a riot.

06:33.645 --> 06:36.598
Okay, guess what?
I've got even more good news.

06:36.599 --> 06:39.684
Tucker got you an interview
tomorrow with Mary Hart.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.332
Really?

06:41.333 --> 06:44.322
First my Jersey sells out and now
I get to interview Mary Hart?

06:45.270 --> 06:47.971
Mary, who do you like
in the playoffs?

06:50.480 --> 06:51.780
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:53.031 --> 06:56.361
Okay, maybe I'll just write out
the questions <i>and</i> the answers

06:56.362 --> 06:58.146
that you'll be giving
to Mary.

06:58.371 --> 07:00.181
Oh, yeah.
That works too.

07:00.182 --> 07:02.340
I'll help right after
you buy me lunch.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.617
- Wait, why am I buying you lunch?
- Are you kidding me?

07:04.643 --> 07:07.405
After that kiss, you should
buy me dinner and a purse.

07:08.381 --> 07:10.952
Danny, there you are.
Hey, so how's Riley doing?

07:10.953 --> 07:13.335
Is she happy,
sad, conflicted,

07:13.369 --> 07:15.570
sticking pins in a small doll
that looks like me?

07:15.605 --> 07:18.174
'Cause my neck has been
killing me all morning.

07:18.407 --> 07:20.442
Actually, I think
she's ready to move on.

07:20.476 --> 07:23.512
Move on?
As in <i>"Ben" voyage?</i>

07:24.390 --> 07:26.381
<i>"Ben" there done that?</i>

07:27.105 --> 07:29.560
Well, it's not like you're
over there fighting for her.

07:29.585 --> 07:33.041
Well, I would've if I thought
something like that would work.

07:34.425 --> 07:36.142
Oh my God,
that could work.

07:36.826 --> 07:39.102
Oh, I've got to go.
Hey, cover for me.

07:40.405 --> 07:42.310
Oh! Hey, mom!

07:42.311 --> 07:45.584
Did you know they're making
towels that look like my jersey?

07:46.836 --> 07:49.571
Ben, hi. Um, what
are you doing here?

07:49.572 --> 07:51.706
We need to talk.
Look, Riley, I've been a fool.

07:51.712 --> 07:52.940
The most important thing...

07:52.941 --> 07:56.005
Oh, why is there a half-naked man
coming out of your bathroom?

07:56.006 --> 07:57.540
Oh, hey, Ben.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.650
You remember Fitch.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.575
Seriously...?
Riley and Fitch?!

08:07.592 --> 08:09.320
I can't believe it.
Can you believe it?

08:09.345 --> 08:11.412
'Cause I know
I can't believe it.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.614
What are you doing?

08:12.648 --> 08:14.558
Working on questions
for Danny's interview.

08:14.583 --> 08:18.376
If you could have dinner
with Gandhi or Jesus Christ,

08:18.604 --> 08:20.443
what would you order?

08:21.557 --> 08:24.067
Tucker, I'm having
a crisis here.

08:24.493 --> 08:26.394
I just thought I meant
something to her.

08:26.428 --> 08:28.296
But obviously she still
has feelings for Fitch.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.431
Riley does not have
feelings for Fitch.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.299
Oh, you weren't there.
Trust me.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.369
They were having feelings.

08:34.948 --> 08:39.027
Ben, look, I believe the scientific
term is called <i>rebound.</i>

08:39.028 --> 08:41.432
It's what you do when you want
to get over someone.

08:41.466 --> 08:44.668
And it seems like that's exactly
what Riley's tryg into do.

08:44.703 --> 08:47.165
- She's moving on.
- That's what Danny said.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.539
Well, then maybe you
should do that too.

08:48.573 --> 08:52.150
You know, if you could spend
one day with Abraham Lincoln...

08:52.644 --> 08:55.337
Would it be
a Tuesday or a Thursday?

08:57.383 --> 08:59.284
- Thursday.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.234 --> 09:04.405
Now remember, honey. You have
nothing to be nervous about.

09:04.439 --> 09:08.102
Other than the fact that this interview
could make or break both of our careers.

09:08.437 --> 09:10.288
Okay, are you ready?
I'm Mary.

09:10.322 --> 09:12.722
And we're live
in four, three...

09:14.223 --> 09:17.326
♪ Shwada shwada shwa ♪

09:17.360 --> 09:18.460
♪ Mary ♪

09:20.789 --> 09:23.198
welcome, Danny.
First question...

09:24.647 --> 09:26.772
- She does that.
- Yes, I know.

09:26.929 --> 09:29.765
What's going on in your love life?
Are you single?

09:29.766 --> 09:32.270
- Tucker, you know I'm single.
- Oh my God, I am not Tucker.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.834
I am Mary. Did you not
see the hair flip?

09:33.835 --> 09:35.586
Come on.
Come on.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.483
I don't want to talk
about my love life.

09:37.484 --> 09:38.551
Can't we just
talk about hockey?

09:38.552 --> 09:40.619
Conk, click. No.

09:40.862 --> 09:43.320
Danny, nobody gives a crap
about hockey.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.824
They wanna hear about
romance, affairs of the heart.

09:45.825 --> 09:48.631
Well, I haven't had any of those
since Amy and I broke up.

09:48.632 --> 09:50.649
Ooh, Amy.

09:52.078 --> 09:54.985
Oh, wow, so tell me about Amy.
Why'd you break up?

09:54.986 --> 09:57.754
Well, um...

09:58.134 --> 10:00.302
I really don't want
to talk about it.

10:00.337 --> 10:03.238
Why? Was it difficult,
painful, heart-wrenching?

10:04.755 --> 10:06.890
It's just, u..

10:07.651 --> 10:10.770
See, whenever I end up
talking about Amy,

10:10.771 --> 10:12.097
I end up...

10:13.571 --> 10:15.284
I end up...

10:20.275 --> 10:22.528
Oh my God, Danny.
Are you crying?

10:22.529 --> 10:24.098
No! No.

10:24.726 --> 10:27.549
My face is just leaking.
Don't look at me!

10:29.227 --> 10:32.817
Danny, I had no idea
you were so upset about her.

10:32.818 --> 10:34.360
- I'm not!
- Okay.

10:34.361 --> 10:37.927
It's just whenever I think about Amy,
I think about why we broke up.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.235
And then I end up
thinking about...

10:39.236 --> 10:41.649
- Knock, knock.
- Riley.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.785
Hey, I just, um...

10:43.817 --> 10:46.926
I got something in my eye.
It's an eyelash.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.125
Oh, look, I got it.
Make a wish.

10:51.410 --> 10:52.976
Um, is Ben around?

10:53.010 --> 10:55.077
What do I look like?
His mother?

10:59.366 --> 11:02.368
Okay, so what
we've learned so far

11:02.369 --> 11:04.443
is, um, no Amy,

11:04.444 --> 11:05.777
no hockey,

11:05.778 --> 11:08.547
and no chance of me
getting that promotion.

11:11.616 --> 11:14.518
Ben, it's me.
Can we talk?

11:15.954 --> 11:17.488
Please?

11:17.522 --> 11:19.319
Seriously?

11:19.320 --> 11:21.709
How is anybody supposed
to get over anybody

11:21.710 --> 11:23.887
if, every two seconds,
anybody is always trying

11:23.888 --> 11:26.206
to get back together
with somebody?

11:27.832 --> 11:29.411
Anybody?

11:30.031 --> 11:33.090
You must be just wrecked
that Riley just slept with Fitch.

11:33.091 --> 11:34.571
What?!

11:34.639 --> 11:36.540
When did that happen?!

11:36.558 --> 11:39.560
Oh, honey...

11:39.594 --> 11:41.148
Okay.

11:41.563 --> 11:45.251
All right. Listen to me, Danny.
I am talking to you as your mother,

11:45.252 --> 11:47.491
your manager,
and someone who loves you.

11:47.492 --> 11:51.625
We have got a lot riding on this,
so you need to pull it together, leaky!

11:53.810 --> 11:55.526
Okay, fine.
You won't come out.

11:57.303 --> 11:59.563
I'll just talk
and you listen.

12:00.016 --> 12:03.006
Look, nothing happened
with me and Fitch.

12:03.007 --> 12:04.568
I swear.

12:04.602 --> 12:06.978
So he just came over
to change his clothes?

12:06.986 --> 12:10.270
How stupid do you think I am?
Don't answer that.

12:10.475 --> 12:13.577
Look, yes,
I was mad and hurt.

12:13.611 --> 12:15.713
And I thought that somehow
it might help me move on,

12:15.747 --> 12:19.650
but I realized that I was doing it
for all the wrong reasons and...

12:19.684 --> 12:21.652
We just ended up talking.

12:22.390 --> 12:24.755
- Really?
- Yes.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.376
Ben, come on.
You know me.

12:27.377 --> 12:29.906
I would never do
something like that to you.

12:30.808 --> 12:33.910
Oh, hey, Riley.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:42.559 --> 12:46.002
Okay. Mary will be out in two minutes.
Do you need anything?

12:46.003 --> 12:49.135
- Tea, lozenge, back pillow?
- Is this really your job?

12:50.743 --> 12:52.744
Okay, Danny,
we are all set.

12:52.778 --> 12:56.596
I talked to Jon, the camera guy and
he knows to only shoot you from the left.

12:56.597 --> 12:59.559
And Judy, she's the makeup girl,
she's on the lookout for flop sweat.

12:59.569 --> 13:02.970
And Marco, the cue-card guy,
has a thing for tall blondes.

13:04.204 --> 13:05.794
Oh, and he made you these.

13:05.841 --> 13:08.827
Wow, Danny, I can't believe
you're gonna be on TV.

13:08.861 --> 13:12.832
Wait, I'm not gonna be on TV, am I?
'Cause I called in sick to work, so...

13:13.783 --> 13:16.202
Ben, you are not even
supposed to be here.

13:16.203 --> 13:18.649
I purposefully gave you
the wrong time.

13:19.672 --> 13:21.606
I invited him.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.676
This is my first big interview. I want my
brother and my best friend to be here.

13:24.710 --> 13:26.945
I'm sorry. Your best what?
Riley's not coming here, is she?

13:26.979 --> 13:28.248
Hey, everyone,
I hope we're not late.

13:28.249 --> 13:30.316
Oh, hey, Ben.
Where's your girlfriend?

13:30.317 --> 13:33.651
- Angela's not my girlfriend.
- Oh no, what happened?

13:33.652 --> 13:35.815
Did you already cheat on her
with the hair lady?

13:36.689 --> 13:39.720
You were right.
This is so not awkward.

13:39.892 --> 13:42.760
Hey, guys, do we really
need to do this right now?

13:42.795 --> 13:46.210
Yeah, Danny is right.
Okay, he needs to stay focused.

13:46.211 --> 13:49.213
And we need to make sure that
he knows all of these answers.

13:49.247 --> 13:53.003
Okay. Ooh, hey.
Comfy.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.616
No, no, no, no.
That is Mary's chair.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.946
It was molded to fit
her butt perfectly.

13:57.947 --> 14:00.849
Maybe I should tell her about the time
I made a jell-o mold of my butt.

14:00.850 --> 14:02.427
No, Danny.

14:02.506 --> 14:05.095
If it's not on the cards,
you're not saying it.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.693
I'm not saying your stupid answers.
They don't sound anything like me.

14:07.694 --> 14:09.762
Exactly.
That's the whole point.

14:09.947 --> 14:12.286
Hey, hey, guys, do I
need to remind everybody

14:12.287 --> 14:14.271
that my jersey sold out
in two days?

14:14.289 --> 14:17.886
I think it's pretty clear that Mary
needs me more than I need her.

14:18.973 --> 14:21.456
But what if she didn't?

14:24.160 --> 14:25.731
She's coming.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.733
You people, over there!
You, up.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.304
- Stop it.
- What? I'm not even doing anything.

14:30.338 --> 14:32.802
- Oh my God.
- Oh, hey, Mary.

14:33.718 --> 14:35.198
Hey, Mary,
Bonnie Wheeler.

14:35.199 --> 14:36.985
- I'm your biggest fan.
- That's nice.

14:36.986 --> 14:39.313
But who's the tall
glass of wow?

14:39.818 --> 14:42.182
Danny Wheeler,
professional hockey player

14:42.220 --> 14:44.766
filled with fascinating stories
about my life on the ice.

14:44.767 --> 14:48.484
Well, as long as you keep them
to yourself, we should be just fine.

14:49.175 --> 14:51.810
- Just listen to what I...
- Ben, why are we even talking?

14:51.811 --> 14:54.053
You have no excuse
for your behavior.

14:54.073 --> 14:56.590
Would you be
willing to accept

14:56.591 --> 14:59.392
you told me to get together
with her in the first place?

15:00.118 --> 15:02.002
I did not say that.

15:02.036 --> 15:05.122
I said see if you have something.
Something is not sex.

15:05.173 --> 15:06.924
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

15:08.102 --> 15:10.137
Yo, yo,
back me up here, man.

15:10.328 --> 15:12.267
It is a little ambiguous.

15:14.908 --> 15:16.008
<i>♪ Mary</i>

15:16.009 --> 15:19.959
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another
edition of "The Mary Hart Show."

15:19.960 --> 15:21.827
I'm Mary Hart.

15:22.106 --> 15:24.966
My first guest
is the ridiculously handsome

15:24.967 --> 15:27.344
New York Ranger
Danny Wheeler.

15:27.345 --> 15:32.580
So, Danny, can you tell us something
about yourself no one else knows?

15:33.305 --> 15:35.710
___

15:35.920 --> 15:37.871
Well, Mary,

15:37.906 --> 15:40.664
one thing that no one else
seems to know about me

15:40.665 --> 15:43.482
is that I can actually
answer questions on my own.

15:43.483 --> 15:46.063
Okay.

15:46.097 --> 15:49.341
Not necessarily something
you need to tell people.

15:49.561 --> 15:50.766
Riley, please.

15:50.767 --> 15:53.170
There has to be something I can say
to make you let this go.

15:53.204 --> 15:55.719
Let it go? No,
I cannot just let it go.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.875
- I think I should go.
- No, no, no. No, no.

15:58.893 --> 16:00.138
You are staying right here.

16:00.139 --> 16:02.907
Because the minute this is over,
we're going back to my place.

16:02.908 --> 16:05.860
And this time,
we really are gonna do it.

16:10.165 --> 16:11.866
So just so we're clear,

16:11.900 --> 16:14.168
there are 30 teams,
six divisions,

16:14.169 --> 16:16.971
two conferences,
but only one Stanley Cup.

16:17.005 --> 16:20.655
Well, I'm usually known
for making people cry,

16:20.656 --> 16:24.745
but I think the only tears we're
gonna see today will be mine.

16:25.961 --> 16:29.140
- No, no, no, no. We can't.
- We have to do something.

16:29.217 --> 16:31.482
If your career ended tomorrow

16:31.483 --> 16:34.582
or perhaps even right
after this interview...

16:36.158 --> 16:37.858
What would you do?

16:37.893 --> 16:39.827
Oh God, okay, just do it.

16:39.861 --> 16:43.848
He'll thank us for this later.
Or I'll just tell him it was your idea.

16:44.551 --> 16:46.551
___

16:46.552 --> 16:49.870
- Does that say "Amy"?
- What? Whoa. What about Amy?

16:49.905 --> 16:52.246
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about her.

16:52.247 --> 16:55.680
It's okay, Danny.
It's just us.

16:56.581 --> 16:58.845
Please, Riley, can't we
just talk about this?

16:58.847 --> 17:01.015
Ben, there is truly
nothing to talk about.

17:01.049 --> 17:03.984
Nothing?! No, there is
everything to talk about.

17:04.019 --> 17:07.154
How about the fact that this whole thing
started when you got upset when I answered

17:07.189 --> 17:10.958
a hypothetical question about
a girl I care nothing about.

17:10.992 --> 17:13.027
Or that when you
walked out,

17:13.060 --> 17:16.207
it felt like my heart had been
physically ripped out of my chest.

17:16.208 --> 17:20.497
Or the fact that any rational
human being who saw what I saw

17:20.498 --> 17:22.397
would think that you
and Fitch had hooked up.

17:22.492 --> 17:26.997
Yes, hooking up with Angela was probably
the dumbest thing I have ever done.

17:27.008 --> 17:29.255
But it wasn't to hurt you,
Riley.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.391
It was to try to stop me
from hurting.

17:31.563 --> 17:33.293
And you know what?

17:33.397 --> 17:35.431
It didn't work.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.376
I don't know if this is
the best time to mention it,

17:40.401 --> 17:43.036
but the big guy's kind of
bawling his eyes out.

17:44.969 --> 17:46.203
Go on.

17:48.442 --> 17:52.112
See, that's the thing
about being in love, Mary.

17:52.146 --> 17:55.215
It's great
until it's not.

17:56.482 --> 17:59.457
And then that person who was
your best friend is gone.

17:59.613 --> 18:02.644
I don't wanna
lose any more friends.

18:06.275 --> 18:09.177
And we'll be right back.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.873
Are you okay, honey?

18:10.874 --> 18:12.771
'Cause we're gonna need
to have you cry again

18:12.772 --> 18:14.773
when we come back
from commercial.

18:23.277 --> 18:24.941
Ben, I'm sorry.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.949
I haven't made this
easy on you.

18:28.006 --> 18:30.563
I guess we both
made some mistakes.

18:30.641 --> 18:32.385
Some worse than others.

18:34.302 --> 18:36.241
I mean, Danny's right.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.914
I can't lose you.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.214
That's good.
Then we're in agreement.

18:42.429 --> 18:45.839
So we're gonna be okay?
We can go back to being us?

18:45.840 --> 18:49.059
Um, I don't think
I can do "us".

18:49.672 --> 18:53.878
I mean, maybe one day,
but not right now.

18:55.228 --> 18:56.562
Okay.

18:57.050 --> 18:59.152
Well, then I'll look
forward to that day.

19:02.483 --> 19:05.727
So where does that leave us?

19:08.197 --> 19:10.676
Are we still a go
on the whole sex thing?

19:11.954 --> 19:14.964
Well, I'm in town till Thursday
if you change your mind.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.875
Yeah, and then when
you really got choked up

19:21.900 --> 19:23.034
and couldn't catch
your breath,

19:23.068 --> 19:25.836
the tears were streaming
and the snot was flowing.

19:25.854 --> 19:27.021
Ratings gold!

19:27.055 --> 19:29.840
He cries!
He scores!

19:31.643 --> 19:32.894
Um, did you notice

19:32.945 --> 19:34.645
there's about 20 women
downstairs

19:34.679 --> 19:36.634
clutching your photo
and chanting your name?

19:36.648 --> 19:39.884
Yes, that's because I've been
labeled a sensitive jock.

19:39.902 --> 19:41.819
And later, I plan
on going downstairs

19:41.853 --> 19:44.401
and getting sensitive with
each and every one of them.

19:44.402 --> 19:47.909
Hey, while you're down there,
try to unload a few of these, okay?

19:47.960 --> 19:50.661
Ask for $100,
but I'll take $20.

19:51.863 --> 19:54.899
So any luck working
things out with Riley?

19:54.933 --> 19:58.603
More like working on working
things out with Riley.

19:58.637 --> 20:01.017
Ben, look, I know
it's none of my business,

20:01.018 --> 20:04.619
but you are never gonna get anywhere
if you don't get rid of Angela.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.123
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem anymore.

20:11.781 --> 20:13.481
"Dear, Ben."

20:13.617 --> 20:15.584
"I took that part
in L.A."

20:15.666 --> 20:17.309
"You were right."

20:17.447 --> 20:19.566
"I'm not ready
to play house."

20:20.027 --> 20:21.924
"Tell Emma
I love her."

20:22.343 --> 20:23.828
"Angela."

20:26.099 --> 20:28.166
And she's gone again.

20:29.835 --> 20:33.268
Apparently the only girl I'm destined
to ever have a relationship with

20:33.269 --> 20:35.361
is this one right here.

20:36.975 --> 20:38.572
Oh my God.

20:38.573 --> 20:40.845
That's the sweetest thing
