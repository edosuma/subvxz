WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:02.950
- Thank you all
for coming in early.

00:04.290 --> 00:07.220
Uh, there's been
an unfortunate incident

00:07.260 --> 00:08.560
we need to discuss.

00:08.590 --> 00:10.060
- Nothing.

00:10.090 --> 00:11.460
I got it pierced. No big deal.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.100
- Oh, wait, hold up.
What are we working with here?

00:13.130 --> 00:15.200
Is that a...
a snake or a lightning bolt?

00:15.230 --> 00:17.100
- This is not what I'm here...
it's a guitar.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.140
An electric guitar.

00:18.170 --> 00:20.140
Anyway, Roger from the Café,

00:20.170 --> 00:22.310
as most of you may have heard,
has been let go,

00:22.340 --> 00:24.140
uh, for releasing
a Facebook video

00:24.170 --> 00:25.280
in which he was behaving
in a manner

00:25.310 --> 00:27.140
that Cloud 9 does not condone.

00:27.180 --> 00:29.250
- Just say it;
he farted in the cups.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.150
- We all saw the video.
I didn't see it.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.420
- It's been taken down.
- Guys...

00:32.450 --> 00:33.850
- I saved it.
I'll send it to you.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.520
- Thanks, man.
- I don't understand.

00:35.550 --> 00:38.860
Who even thinks of farting in
cups as something to do?

00:38.890 --> 00:41.430
- It's so gross!
Especially in the kitchen.

00:41.460 --> 00:44.190
- If you think about it,
it's not that gross.

00:44.230 --> 00:45.760
Farts are just air.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.270
- Cheyenne, that's beautiful!
- But it's not exactly true.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.830
Fart air has billions
of fecal particles in it.

00:50.870 --> 00:53.540
I mean, that's what causes
the smell... feces in your nose.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.170
- I thought the gas
just smelled.

00:55.210 --> 00:56.740
- Fart ingredients.
- Okay, no...

00:56.770 --> 01:00.180
We don't need to do that.
That's... I think the lesson here

01:00.210 --> 01:02.610
is be careful what you post
on social media.

01:02.650 --> 01:05.450
- Um, shouldn't the lesson be:
don't fart in cups?

01:05.480 --> 01:07.420
- Yes.
In a perfect world,

01:07.450 --> 01:10.250
people wouldn't fart in cups,
but we live in the real world.

01:10.290 --> 01:11.560
- Um, when you say "be careful,"

01:11.590 --> 01:13.260
what are we not allowed to post?

01:13.290 --> 01:15.760
Because I do a lot
of Instagram videos

01:15.790 --> 01:18.130
and they can be pretty edgy.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.330
- No.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.570
- Then I think
we're pretty good.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.770
I'm gonna take a look

01:22.800 --> 01:24.200
at everybody's social media,

01:24.230 --> 01:25.670
make sure everything's
above board.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.140
- No, uh, that's not necessary.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.640
Everybody here can self-police.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.910
- Uh, why self-police when
you can have actual police?

01:32.580 --> 01:34.140
- Ha!

01:34.180 --> 01:36.310
Wait, these cups?

01:40.920 --> 01:46.660
♪ But even the crowd
can't help me now ♪

01:46.690 --> 01:48.560
- Hey, guys.
It's your girl, Kelly.

01:48.590 --> 01:50.260
Check out how many balloons
this guy is buying.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.360
- Kelly's Instagram videos.
They're adorable.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.370
- It better be
somebody's birthday!

01:56.400 --> 01:58.270
- Too funny.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.940
- But it probably was
someone's birthday.

02:00.970 --> 02:02.840
She nailed it.

02:02.870 --> 02:06.410
- Okay, is the joke
that it's so boring, or...

02:06.440 --> 02:08.910
- Oh, did you guys see
the one with the orange?

02:08.949 --> 02:10.250
- Wait.
- Hey, guys.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.680
It's your girl, Kelly.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.250
So I've been trying
to open this orange

02:14.280 --> 02:15.850
for, like, five minutes.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.650
It's pretty much
just unpeelable.

02:17.690 --> 02:19.390
Here, watch.

02:19.420 --> 02:21.830
- Okay, seriously,
that is my life.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.860
- I don't understand this.

02:25.900 --> 02:29.400
I sent out a mass email
to all our rewards customers,

02:29.430 --> 02:31.670
you know, to apologize for...

02:31.700 --> 02:33.770
the attack on the cups,

02:33.800 --> 02:35.410
and look!

02:35.440 --> 02:36.940
- "Dear, valued customer,

02:36.970 --> 02:39.710
"when humans eat food, it's
processed in the intestines,

02:39.740 --> 02:41.210
producing gas."

02:41.250 --> 02:42.810
Wow, you really
took it from the top.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.380
- Yeah, of course.
But then look.

02:44.410 --> 02:45.880
A huge number of these things

02:45.920 --> 02:48.450
bounced back,
and that makes me worried

02:48.490 --> 02:50.220
that it's either
Russian hackers...

02:50.250 --> 02:51.360
- Could be them.
That's their style.

02:51.390 --> 02:52.620
- Or I picked up a virus

02:52.660 --> 02:54.960
looking at those
baptism videos, maybe.

02:54.990 --> 02:57.930
- That's where they are.
- Or...

02:57.960 --> 02:59.930
An employee's inventing
fake customers.

03:01.470 --> 03:02.970
- Well, because you get a dollar

03:03.000 --> 03:05.240
for every rewards card
that you sign up.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.900
You get a dollar per Blue Card?

03:06.940 --> 03:08.940
Since when?
- Since always.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.570
You know, so theoretically,

03:10.610 --> 03:12.610
employees could just fill out
a bunch of fake forms

03:12.640 --> 03:15.410
and over time, it...
God, that would really add up.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.650
- That's... Something I can't
believe people haven't

03:17.680 --> 03:19.480
- been doing the entire time.
- Yeah.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.250
- It'd be almost impossible
to trace.

03:21.290 --> 03:23.290
- I get it.
- Except...

03:23.320 --> 03:25.320
Almost all of these customers

03:25.360 --> 03:27.690
were signed up
by the same employee.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.990
Who?

03:29.030 --> 03:31.360
- I sign up a lot of...
rewards customers.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.860
I mean, I... can't remember
every single one.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.300
- It's just that I noticed

03:35.330 --> 03:38.800
they seem to have really
unusual names.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.940
Ned Duracell.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.670
Jim Toblerone.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.670
And just this morning,
you signed up

03:44.710 --> 03:46.880
a Martin Nestle.

03:46.910 --> 03:48.910
- Oh, Martin!
Uh, yeah.

03:48.950 --> 03:50.510
I... I remember him.

03:50.550 --> 03:53.280
Uh, good guy.
Nice family.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.690
- Mateo,
can you think of any reason

03:55.720 --> 03:59.520
why Martin's email bounced back?

04:01.360 --> 04:03.060
- That's one reason.
Um...

04:03.090 --> 04:04.490
But another one is...

04:04.530 --> 04:06.930
a-and I'm not accusing you
of this,

04:06.960 --> 04:09.970
but maybe...

04:10.000 --> 04:12.640
You made him up?

04:12.670 --> 04:14.400
Glenn!

04:15.910 --> 04:17.370
Wow!

04:17.410 --> 04:18.680
I need your help

04:18.709 --> 04:20.010
accessing people's social media

04:20.040 --> 04:21.510
before we have another scandal.

04:21.550 --> 04:24.050
I feel like that lady
from "Scandal."

04:24.080 --> 04:25.920
Is her name Scandal?

04:25.950 --> 04:28.390
- Um, can't you just do it
yourself?

04:28.420 --> 04:30.520
- Don't do social media.
Never have. Never will.

04:30.550 --> 04:31.860
Don't want anyone tracking me.

04:31.890 --> 04:33.460
I only use the Internet
for two things:

04:33.490 --> 04:35.530
buying birdseed, watching porn.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.530
Besides, it'll be fun.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.400
Couple of gals clickin'
and a-clackin'

04:39.430 --> 04:41.400
around the net.

04:41.430 --> 04:43.970
- Are you asking me,
or telling me I have to?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.670
- I'm telling you you have to,

04:45.700 --> 04:48.040
but in a way that makes it
sound like I'm asking you.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.070
- Okay, then I guess I will.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.610
- Yeah.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.680
- Hey, guys.
It's your girl, Kelly.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.420
You know how sometimes
you get a shopping cart

04:58.450 --> 04:59.820
with a bad wheel?

04:59.850 --> 05:02.950
Well, this one has
a really bad wheel.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.090
AKA, no wheel!

05:05.120 --> 05:07.090
- Check it out!

05:09.460 --> 05:11.130
- Wheel fail!

05:12.760 --> 05:15.570
What am I missing here?
This is lame.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.970
- No, I know! So lame.
- It's your girl, Kelly.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.640
I'm just having
a little breakfast,

05:20.670 --> 05:22.910
the most important meal
of the day,

05:22.940 --> 05:25.640
although some people
refuse to eat it.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.140
- All your cereals
have marshmallows.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.850
It's like you're
a nine-year-old.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.380
- Oh.
- Well, they're fun, Jonah.

05:32.620 --> 05:35.590
Hey, um, I might need a ride
home later today.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.420
Do you happen to know
where Kelly lives?

05:37.450 --> 05:38.760
- Uh, lemme see.

05:38.790 --> 05:42.060
I think I heard she lives
over in Soulard now.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.630
- Okay, yeah, great.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.730
And um, what side of the bed
does she sleep on?

05:46.760 --> 05:48.060
- Wh...

05:48.100 --> 05:50.000
Well, I don't...
why would...

05:50.030 --> 05:51.740
- You know.
- I know.

05:51.770 --> 05:55.610
- I-I wasn't, like, trying to
not tell you or anything.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.940
We've just been
kind of laying low.

05:56.970 --> 05:58.710
You know, it hasn't
actually been that long.

05:58.740 --> 06:00.610
- Jonah, relax.
- It's fine.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.080
I think it's great.
It's great.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.480
- Kelly's sweet.
- She is.

06:04.510 --> 06:06.050
- And besides,
I'm kind of relieved.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.490
I couldn't figure out why
you liked those dumb videos.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.020
- I mean, I don't mean dumb.

06:10.050 --> 06:13.090
I just mean, like, "Ah,
I can't peel this orange."

06:13.120 --> 06:15.020
It's not exactly a TED talk.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.160
- I like her videos.

06:16.190 --> 06:18.430
- Mm-hmm.
You like her something.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.560
You're just jealous.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.900
- Uh, someone's
flattering himself.

06:22.930 --> 06:26.470
- No, I meant jealous that
everybody loves her videos.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.210
- Yeah, I know
that's what you meant.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.480
And why would I be jealous
of her videos?

06:31.510 --> 06:34.610
Oh, she filmed herself
microwaving ramen

06:34.640 --> 06:37.050
and she got 100 people
to view it.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.720
Yeah, she's Sofia Coppola.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.520
- You couldn't do it.
- Please.

06:40.550 --> 06:42.490
You could get 100 people
to watch anything.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.920
- Fine. Then do it.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.460
100 views
by the end of the day...

06:46.490 --> 06:48.190
loser has to clean
the rat traps.

06:48.220 --> 06:49.990
- Okay, well then, you're on,

06:50.030 --> 06:51.660
and I hope you like dead rats.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.000
- I hope you like failure.
- I hope you like...

06:55.030 --> 06:57.200
Me winning bets.

07:02.940 --> 07:03.940
- ♪ It's getting late
to give you up ♪

07:06.840 --> 07:09.580
- Hi! It's Cloud9 Amy!

07:09.610 --> 07:11.920
Comin' at you from Cloud 9...

07:11.950 --> 07:13.880
in St. Louis, Missouri,

07:13.920 --> 07:16.050
between aisles seven and eight.

07:16.090 --> 07:19.520
Oh, look!
It's a two-for-one sale!

07:19.560 --> 07:21.890
How come you never hear of one

07:21.930 --> 07:25.630
Oh, probably because no one
would ever pay twice as much.

07:25.660 --> 07:27.830
All right, that is bad.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.740
Can you please not watch me?

07:31.770 --> 07:34.170
It's riveting.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.980
- Hi! It's Cloud 9 Amy!

07:41.180 --> 07:42.810
How long have you
been doing this?

07:42.850 --> 07:44.950
- I started my second day.
I thought everyone did it!

07:44.980 --> 07:46.650
I mean, it's kind of obvious.

07:46.680 --> 07:47.720
- Not to everyone.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.090
- Oh, hey, Glenn!

07:49.120 --> 07:50.950
It was really bugging me
that Martin Nestle lied

07:50.990 --> 07:52.760
about his email address,
so I did some digging

07:52.790 --> 07:56.260
and I found his actual email
on his company website.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.930
- Boogie-Time Boogie Boards,
Incorporated.

08:01.970 --> 08:05.800
That doesn't look like a very
professional website, does it?

08:07.340 --> 08:08.910
These beach bum types.

08:08.940 --> 08:11.070
Anyway...

08:11.110 --> 08:14.680
There he is.
Martin Nestle, CEO.

08:14.710 --> 08:16.110
- Huh.

08:16.150 --> 08:18.720
That looks like the guy
from "Twilight."

08:19.880 --> 08:23.320
- No. Jerusha said I shouldn't.

08:23.350 --> 08:25.250
So I didn't.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.220
- I mean...

08:26.260 --> 08:28.860
I guess it kinda looks like him

08:28.890 --> 08:31.860
if you squint.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.330
It's so funny
you know who that is.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.130
- Hey, let's see
if they have a page

08:35.159 --> 08:37.130
for buying a boogie board
on there, huh?

08:37.169 --> 08:38.870
- I don't think that the link
is up yet.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.140
- Click on the "About,"
where it tells you

08:40.169 --> 08:43.740
the story
of how the company started.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.310
- Excuse me, ma'am.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.280
Do you have a moment
to watch a short video?

08:47.310 --> 08:51.010
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I just moved here from Tampa.

08:51.050 --> 08:53.720
- Ooh, Garrett!
Have you watched my video yet?

08:54.980 --> 08:56.150
- 'Cause I'm trying
to prove to Jonah

08:56.190 --> 08:57.690
that I can get more views
than Kelly.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.820
No.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.020
That doesn't have anything
to do with it.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.630
This is about having
a web presence.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.030
Jeez, Garrett, get with it.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.660
- You're right.
I'll work on my self-awareness.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.230
- Oh, come on!
Still only 12 views.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.970
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers!

09:16.010 --> 09:18.710
Who likes viral videos?

09:18.740 --> 09:20.980
Ma'am

09:21.010 --> 09:23.010
- Man, Facebook is a bust.

09:23.050 --> 09:24.610
It's all baby photos and quizzes

09:24.650 --> 09:26.950
about which "Longmire"
character you are.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.320
- Cool.
Then I guess we can stop?

09:29.350 --> 09:30.720
- Hang on.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.090
Elias went on a date
with two women?

09:33.120 --> 09:36.130
- It's probably just
his wife's sister or something.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.900
- Mm, yeah.
I don't think so.

09:39.930 --> 09:41.200
- Oh, my God!

09:41.230 --> 09:42.970
Elias is in a throuple.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.400
- Throuple.

09:44.430 --> 09:47.140
Is that like when three hideous
people get together?

09:47.170 --> 09:48.740
- Just three people.
- Oh.

09:48.770 --> 09:52.040
- But yeah, they usually are.
- Hmm.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.010
- Hey, Glenn,
there's a customer here

09:54.040 --> 09:56.850
- who wants to talk to a manager.
- Okay.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.920
Hello. Glenn Sturgis speaking.

09:58.950 --> 10:02.720
- Yes, this is Martin Nestle.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.390
- Well, hello, Mr. Nestle.

10:04.420 --> 10:05.190
Trace this call.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.360
- Yeah, I don't have
that technology.

10:07.390 --> 10:09.430
- I signed up for a Blue Card

10:09.460 --> 10:12.230
and I think I may have given
the wrong email.

10:12.260 --> 10:15.700
- Okay, well, thank you
for calling to tell us.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.370
Are you tracing this call?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.240
While I have you on the phone,

10:20.270 --> 10:21.840
what'd you think of the employee

10:21.870 --> 10:23.240
who signed you up?

10:23.270 --> 10:25.880
His name's Mateo.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.780
And I think he's a real dummy!

10:27.810 --> 10:29.410
A class A stinker!

10:29.450 --> 10:32.320
- What are you saying about me?

10:32.350 --> 10:33.720
- Oh.

10:33.750 --> 10:36.920
- Mr. Sturgis,
I need to get back to work.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.120
- Uh, okay, then.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.060
Well, h-have a heavenly day.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.090
- Oh.
Who were you talking to?

10:42.130 --> 10:44.960
- Martin Nestle.

10:44.990 --> 10:46.700
- Oh.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.030
- Lost the trace.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.870
Did you know
Marcus has a podcast

10:52.900 --> 10:54.940
called "Celebrities
I Would Bone,"

10:54.970 --> 10:56.740
and in every episode
he just lists

10:56.770 --> 10:58.210
celebrities he would bone.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.850
- Man, there is an audience
out there for anything.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.880
Oh, wow.
Okay, you're gonna love this.

11:03.910 --> 11:06.780
Remember Anna who had to leave
to take care of her sick mom?

11:06.820 --> 11:10.950
Well, turns out her sick mom
is also a boob surgeon!

11:10.990 --> 11:12.190
- Wow!

11:12.220 --> 11:14.760
He went too big.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.130
- She's gonna have back problems.
- Waste of money.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.430
She should've fixed
her face first.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.800
- Yeah.
- Oh, whoops.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.930
You were supposed to go on
your break ten minutes ago.

11:22.970 --> 11:24.300
- Oh, um, that's okay.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.470
I'll just sit here
and eat my lunch with you.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.210
- Safety always comes...
It's the bottom of the ninth.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.080
- Just a woman going insane.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.780
- Mark down-Io!
Yee-haw!

11:37.810 --> 11:39.350
Howdy, partner.
That was crazy.

11:39.380 --> 11:42.090
How Dem cows...
Inventor-ium!

11:42.120 --> 11:43.220
- Maybe if we took
her phone away...

11:43.250 --> 11:44.850
- Don't even think about it.

11:48.190 --> 11:48.830
- Yo, yo, yo.
It's Cloud 9 Amy

11:49.860 --> 11:51.090
doin' my trick.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.830
Zonin' this aisle
to make it look sick!

11:53.860 --> 11:56.270
You want batteries?
I got loads of D's.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.530
And some frozen peas
full of vitamin C!

11:58.570 --> 12:01.370
Self-check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.370
Self-check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

12:04.410 --> 12:07.980
Self-check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.980
Get it?

12:10.010 --> 12:12.250
So?

12:12.280 --> 12:13.980
- Wow, Amy.

12:14.020 --> 12:16.020
- So fun.

12:16.050 --> 12:17.350
- It's a work in progress,

12:17.390 --> 12:18.890
and... and I know it's corny.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.790
That's what makes it funny.
Right?

12:21.830 --> 12:22.990
- Oh, yeah.

12:23.030 --> 12:24.230
Yeah, definitely.

12:24.260 --> 12:27.000
- So funny.
- Yeah.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.230
- Okay.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.430
Thanks.

12:31.270 --> 12:33.140
- Is this because
Jonah's dating Kelly?

12:33.170 --> 12:35.370
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.970
- I went to theater camp
for two summers.

12:38.010 --> 12:39.440
That was my Audrey II voice.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.180
- Calm down.
- It was fine.

12:41.210 --> 12:43.580
- There is no way you should've
gotten away with this.

12:43.610 --> 12:45.350
- You're just jealous.
- I am.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.980
And I'm not even
trying to hide it.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.850
- Mateo, I want to apologize,

12:49.890 --> 12:52.120
both for the things
that I said about you,

12:52.160 --> 12:55.120
and for thinking that you would
ever make up a customer.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.230
- Well, it's just hard.

12:57.260 --> 12:59.230
I was accused of a crime
by my boss

12:59.260 --> 13:00.430
and role model.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.030
- Take the win.

13:02.070 --> 13:03.300
- I wanna make it up to you.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.030
How about lunch?

13:05.070 --> 13:06.270
We'll go up to the Beef Barn

13:06.300 --> 13:09.040
and get a... a table
right near the tractor?

13:09.070 --> 13:12.380
- Uh, you know, I am actually
starting to get over it.

13:12.410 --> 13:14.440
- Mateo, he's trying
to apologize to you.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.280
- A nice, long lunch,
just the two of you?

13:18.310 --> 13:20.520
Oh, so lucky!

13:20.550 --> 13:22.920
- Glenn, you know,
maybe lunch isn't enough.

13:22.950 --> 13:25.490
- You were really rude to him.
- Oh, yeah, you were.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.930
Maybe stop by a few museums
or something on the way.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.490
- I suppose we could.
- Lunch sounds great.

13:31.530 --> 13:33.860
- Lunch.
- Terrific.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.030
I can't wait!

13:36.230 --> 13:37.970
- Hmm.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.500
I'm feeling less jealous.

13:39.540 --> 13:44.310
- Kate Upton, Arianna Grande,
Serena Williams,

13:44.340 --> 13:48.340
1994 Meryl Streep,
1995 Meryl Streep,

13:48.380 --> 13:50.250
and the "Wonder Woman" chick.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.150
"Celebrities I Would Bone" is
brought to you by Blue Apron,

13:53.180 --> 13:54.480
a better way to cook...

13:54.520 --> 13:57.950
God, that hour flies by.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.390
- Ahhh!

13:59.420 --> 14:01.990
Head into the kitchen where
we make our tasty treats.

14:02.030 --> 14:04.960
Y'all can just kick it
while I drop this sick beat.

14:09.970 --> 14:11.600
This is stupid.

14:11.630 --> 14:15.400
These videos are so stupid.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.450
- Two women want that
inside them.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.120
- What would it take to get
you to sleep with Elias?

14:28.150 --> 14:29.590
- $435 grand.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.050
I have a figure
for everyone here.

14:31.090 --> 14:33.660
Yours is only 75 bucks,
by the way.

14:33.690 --> 14:36.930
- Oh, thank you.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.090
What about Glenn?

14:38.130 --> 14:40.260
- There's not enough money
in the world.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.370
This is so stupid.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.700
All of these videos are stupid.

14:48.740 --> 14:51.470
Not everything
needs to be documented.

14:51.510 --> 14:52.980
Look at where I am!

14:53.010 --> 14:55.010
Look at what I ate
for lunch today.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.650
Nobody cares!

14:56.680 --> 15:00.120
We're all becoming these
narcissistic attention whores.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.120
- How about we actually...
- Okay, at some point

15:02.150 --> 15:03.950
she's gotta see the rats.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.960
Watch, don't watch,

15:06.990 --> 15:08.420
I don't care.

15:08.460 --> 15:10.560
But if you like what you saw,
you can follow me on Snapchat,

15:10.590 --> 15:14.300
Instagram, and Twitter
on @Cloud9AmyD.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.300
- I don't think
she saw the rats.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.930
- I don't think so.

15:18.530 --> 15:21.600
- I am really looking forward
to this, Mateo.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.710
I don't get to take my
employees to lunch very often.

15:24.740 --> 15:26.610
- Well, only the lucky ones,
I guess.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.680
- Yeah, I got to take Jonah
to lunch once.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.450
I really got to know him.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.980
You know, his interests,
his background,

15:33.020 --> 15:34.580
his voice.

15:35.780 --> 15:38.290
- Hey, and since we're going
to Clayton,

15:38.320 --> 15:39.590
you know what's on the way?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.990
Martin Nestle's office.

15:42.030 --> 15:44.190
Maybe we should drop by.

15:44.230 --> 15:47.230
Unless there's some reason
you don't wanna go.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.760
- Nope.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.330
I would...
love to visit Martin.

15:51.370 --> 15:52.500
- Great.

15:52.540 --> 15:55.070
- Great.
- Great.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.140
- Great.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.340
- Great.

15:58.570 --> 16:01.280
- Oh, hey, Jonah, will you help
me read something real quick?

16:01.310 --> 16:05.180
Bam!
15,000 views!

16:05.210 --> 16:06.380
Ha-ha!

16:06.420 --> 16:08.180
- Yep.
- And I only posted it

16:08.220 --> 16:11.350
half an hour ago, which means
there must be a real appetite

16:11.390 --> 16:13.390
for smart social commentary.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.660
- I guess I'm cleaning
the rat traps.

16:15.690 --> 16:17.530
- Yeah.
I guess you are.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.030
- Oh, hey, speaking of
the rat traps,

16:20.060 --> 16:22.430
did you get a chance
to watch the video

16:22.470 --> 16:23.500
before you posted it?

16:25.330 --> 16:26.800
- I know I never explicitly said

16:26.840 --> 16:30.340
not to post videos of rat
infestations in the kitchen,

16:30.370 --> 16:33.210
but I thought I didn't need to.

16:38.450 --> 16:38.850
- Look, I'm sorry.

16:39.950 --> 16:42.520
I should have watched the video
before I posted it.

16:42.550 --> 16:45.490
- How 'bout if we just stop
posting videos of the store,

16:45.520 --> 16:47.160
- period.
- Whoa! No way!

16:47.190 --> 16:48.520
- Aw!
- That's not fair!

16:48.560 --> 16:50.490
- Amy's screw up
shouldn't overshadow the fact

16:50.530 --> 16:52.660
that there's some really
terrific filmmaking going on.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.330
- Like Kelly's.
- Yes.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.200
- Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

16:56.230 --> 16:57.630
- Okay, I'm gonna
start compiling a list

16:57.670 --> 16:59.540
of all the things
we should not be posting about,

16:59.570 --> 17:01.740
starting with farting in cups
and rat infestations.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.369
- Again, didn't know
the rats were there.

17:04.410 --> 17:05.540
- Why did you have to make
a video at all?

17:05.569 --> 17:07.140
- Is it about fame?
- No!

17:07.180 --> 17:09.849
- Murdering a clown.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.220
- That's something that

17:12.250 --> 17:13.480
we shouldn't post online.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.650
- Mm-hmm.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.420
- Okay.
"Murdering a clown."

17:17.450 --> 17:19.119
- You could just write
"anything illegal."

17:19.160 --> 17:21.160
- Look, Amy, are you
going through some kind of

17:21.190 --> 17:22.560
a midlife crisis, is that it?

17:23.760 --> 17:25.530
- Yes, it's a peace sign.
- No.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.359
I was just trying to prove
that I could make a video

17:27.400 --> 17:29.130
that could get a bunch of views.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.470
- Does this have something to
do with Jonah dating Kelly?

17:31.500 --> 17:32.540
- Whoa!

17:32.570 --> 17:34.140
No!

17:34.170 --> 17:35.570
- I knew it.
- Come on.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.510
- We were gonna
keep that a secret.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.870
- Well, then maybe you
shouldn't have posted about it

17:38.910 --> 17:40.310
on the Internet.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.810
- Thank you.
- Do we need to fill out

17:41.840 --> 17:43.680
one of those
relationship disclosures?

17:43.710 --> 17:45.550
- Oh, I'm sorry,
you want to know if you need to

17:45.580 --> 17:48.350
let Corporate know that two
low-level floor workers

17:48.380 --> 17:50.290
are in a relationship?
Yeah, I'm su...

17:50.320 --> 17:51.520
Let me call a board meeting.

17:51.550 --> 17:53.190
- Feels like misplaced
aggression.

17:53.220 --> 17:54.660
- Are we calling it
a relationship?

17:54.690 --> 17:56.330
- Oh, I just meant for the...
- No, I mean... I mean...

17:56.360 --> 17:58.230
- Are you...
- Okay, if you...

17:58.260 --> 17:59.860
- Yeah, no. I'm... I'm cool.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.670
- Cool.
- Cool.

18:02.700 --> 18:07.200
- ♪ I hear the secrets
that you keep ♪

18:07.240 --> 18:09.640
♪ When you're talking
in your sleep ♪

18:13.940 --> 18:17.710
- Weird that this is
a boogie board company.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.750
- Guess he runs his business
out of his home?

18:20.780 --> 18:21.750
Less overhead.

18:21.780 --> 18:23.490
- Mm.

18:27.490 --> 18:29.330
Well, he's obviously not here,
so we sh...

18:29.360 --> 18:31.230
- Oh, hello.

18:31.260 --> 18:33.500
- Hello.
- So sorry to bother you,

18:33.530 --> 18:37.430
but is Martin Nestle here?

18:37.470 --> 18:39.670
- Martin Nestle.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.410
This is Boogie-Time Boogie
Board, Incorporated, isn't it?

18:45.270 --> 18:46.740
- And 11 stitches there.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.940
- Wow. You really do
have a lot of scars.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.510
- Well, that's why
I switched to birds.

18:50.550 --> 18:51.950
Chimps are very violent.

18:51.980 --> 18:54.280
And they're constantly
masturbating.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.620
Birds do it less.

18:55.650 --> 18:56.950
And when a bird orgasms,

18:56.990 --> 18:59.790
it's the most beautiful song
you've ever heard.

18:59.820 --> 19:00.960
- That's cool.

19:00.990 --> 19:03.390
- It is. It is cool.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.390
Gosh.

19:05.430 --> 19:06.860
You know, I'm actually
almost excited

19:06.900 --> 19:08.960
Roger decided to fart
in all those cups and film it,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.670
because...

19:10.700 --> 19:12.870
It gave us a chance to get
to know each other better.

19:15.540 --> 19:17.210
- You wanna know
something funny?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.380
- Uh, yeah!

19:20.410 --> 19:22.510
- I was the one
who filmed him doing it.

19:22.550 --> 19:24.680
- Stop.
- Plus, I dared him to do it.

19:24.710 --> 19:27.320
I was like, "I bet you can't
fart into those cups,"

19:27.350 --> 19:28.820
even though I totally knew
he could.

19:28.850 --> 19:32.420
That's hilarious!

19:39.530 --> 19:41.000
- Oh, my gosh.

19:41.030 --> 19:45.470
- Well, I... I just gotta go
grab the form

19:45.500 --> 19:47.840
to write you up.

19:47.870 --> 19:50.470
Oh, but thank you so much
for sharing that with me.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.510
It means a lot.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.780
- Oh, my God.

19:58.580 --> 20:03.250
- So, I guess that's it then.

20:03.290 --> 20:06.260
- There's no Martin Nestle!

20:06.290 --> 20:07.590
I made him up.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.030
I made them all up,

20:10.060 --> 20:11.590
but I am sorry.

20:11.630 --> 20:14.300
That, I find
difficult to believe.

20:14.330 --> 20:17.530
- Okay, what can I do
to show you that I mean it?

20:17.570 --> 20:19.600
- Well...

20:21.640 --> 20:23.740
Let me just make a quick call.

20:23.770 --> 20:27.010
- Oh, you don't really have to
clean out the rat traps.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.350
- Ah-ah-ah, a bet is a bet,
and you won.

20:30.380 --> 20:33.050
- Yeah, that's not exactly
how I wanted to win.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.350
Here, I'll give you a hand.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.620
- All right!
Let's do this.

20:36.650 --> 20:38.750
- All right.
- Oh! You already have help.

20:38.790 --> 20:41.620
- Oh, well, I worked fast food
jobs through high school,

20:41.660 --> 20:44.460
so I know my way around
a rat trap.

20:44.490 --> 20:46.530
- So many talents.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.300
- Your weapon.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.600
- All right. Oh.

20:50.930 --> 20:53.500
- Okay, well, then I guess
I will just, uh,

20:53.540 --> 20:55.000
- leave you to it.
- Bye!

20:55.040 --> 20:57.470
- Later.

20:57.510 --> 21:01.040
Fun fact.
That is just blueberry soda.

21:05.450 --> 21:09.990
- I now baptize you for
the forgiveness of your sins!

21:16.690 --> 21:17.790
I feel it working.

21:17.830 --> 21:19.860
- That's the Jesus!

21:19.900 --> 21:23.630
Now, come on, I'll buy you
that magnet from the gift shop.
