00:04.672 --> 00:05.073
Previously on ER:

00:05.106 --> 00:06.507
You're a doctor?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.276
Yeah.

00:08.309 --> 00:11.245
Yes, I am.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.414
Mike, I'm leaving that stripper
in Curtain Four

00:13.447 --> 00:14.815
with the broken toe
just for you.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.250
Try not to TUBE her.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.618
What are you
talking about?

00:17.651 --> 00:19.453
Totally Unnecessary
Breast Exam.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.588
It's Sandy.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.824
Sandy Lopez died today.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.227
What am I supposed to do now?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.495
Give me back my son!

00:27.528 --> 00:28.396
Mom, guess what?

00:28.429 --> 00:29.497
Dad's here.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.599
I don't like working
on old people

00:31.632 --> 00:33.601
or children or drunks.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.503
NEELA:
Go to bloody Iraq
and tell yourself

00:35.536 --> 00:37.438
you've done something noble.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.043
( guitar plays simple chords )

00:44.678 --> 00:45.679
Hey.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.814
Hey, Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.516
Look at this.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.552
( playing simple chords )

00:51.585 --> 00:53.087
Hey, that's pretty good.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.522
Dad's been teaching
me to play.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.490
Says we might get
my own guitar today.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.825
Oh, really?

00:57.858 --> 00:59.293
Hey, Alex,
you want scrambled eggs?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.694
Sure.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.595
You could have told me
you needed groceries.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.298
I would have gone.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.599
You all right?
Yeah.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.701
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.339
Listen, take this, okay?

01:11.372 --> 01:13.274
What's this?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.508
That's, you know,
grocery money,

01:14.542 --> 01:17.378
rent money, guilt money.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.780
That's not much guilt.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.282
Look, there's more
where this came from.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.452
I've got a few
jobs lined up and...
Uh-huh.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.819
Look, I'm sure there's
something you and Alex need,

01:25.853 --> 01:27.288
so I'm just going to
leave this here, okay?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.157
What, like a guitar?

01:29.157 --> 01:30.524
Yeah, why not?

01:30.558 --> 01:32.160
It's good for a kid
to learn an instrument.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.827
I mean, music, you know,
it stimulates the brain.

01:33.861 --> 01:37.665
Yeah, prove it.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.500
Well, it helps
score the hot chicks,

01:39.533 --> 01:40.801
that's for sure.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.603
Hey, Dad,
teach me something else.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.438
All right, buddy.
Here, let me see.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.840
This one's a little trickier,
but it's very cool.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.576
You're going to like it.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.844
I've had, uh,
pretty good luck

01:50.878 --> 01:52.646
with this one
with the ladies.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.183

02:04.392 --> 02:05.859
WOMAN:
Let go of me, you dirty freak!

02:05.893 --> 02:07.428
Calm down.
Calm down.
No!

02:07.461 --> 02:08.429
You want Haldol?

02:08.461 --> 02:09.597
Yeah, that and a hammer.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.731
Need any help, Morris?

02:10.764 --> 02:11.765
No, this is going great.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.201
Stop touching me!

02:13.234 --> 02:15.269
Okay, try and relax,
Mrs. Garrison.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.604
You know her?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.206
Yeah.
She's off her meds.
Oh, you think?

02:18.206 --> 02:19.540
What do you want,
five or ten of Haldol?

02:19.573 --> 02:20.841
Ten.
Five.

02:20.874 --> 02:21.842
( strained cries )

02:21.875 --> 02:23.477
All right, this is going

02:23.511 --> 02:25.779
to sting a little,
Mrs. Garrison, okay?

02:25.813 --> 02:26.780
You want hard
restraints?
No!

02:26.814 --> 02:28.282
Nope.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.550
Soft restraints?
No. No restraints.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.618
She'll be fine.
( screams )

02:30.651 --> 02:31.585
( screams in pain )

02:31.619 --> 02:33.221
MALIK:
Whoa!

02:33.221 --> 02:35.289
Guess you should have
put her in restraints.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.624
( screams in pain )

02:36.657 --> 02:40.794
Captioning sponsored by
NBC

02:40.828 --> 02:45.533
and WARNER BROS. TELEVISION

03:26.807 --> 03:29.677
Their argument is that Sandy
was his biological mother,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.612
and you never
legally adopted him.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.746
We were in the process.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.348
And that will help.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.284
Perhaps if the
child's genetic father

03:36.317 --> 03:38.286
was willing to assign
you his rights.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.388
He was an anonymous donor.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.856
We will establish
parental intent.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.325
And I'm confident
we can secure

03:44.358 --> 03:45.526
some sort
of temporary custody.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.828
Temporary?
Henry is my son.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.698
Look, the good news is,
the state has adopted

03:50.731 --> 03:52.700
a sexual-orientation
neutral approach

03:52.733 --> 03:54.502
to child custody
determinations.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.004
But there are other factors
at play here.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.672
Like what?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.841
Well, in addition
to being gay, you're single,

04:00.874 --> 04:02.310
and your work requires

04:02.343 --> 04:04.044
a great deal of time
away from Henry.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.480
Now the Lopezes present
a blood relationship

04:06.514 --> 04:08.416
with a loving,
intact family unit,

04:08.449 --> 04:09.750
and a stay-at-home mom.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.884
I'll change my schedule.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.853
Hell, I'll quit my job
if I have to.

04:12.886 --> 04:13.721
What happened to you?

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
Got bitten by a patient.

04:14.788 --> 04:15.823
What are you doing here?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.325
Working.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.326
You should have
a nurse look at that.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.692
It's okay.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.463
Sam, wash out Dr. Kovac's bite,
update his tetanus,

04:22.496 --> 04:25.065
and check for hepatitis
and HIV on the source.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.434
Sure.
I'll call you.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.369
I'll let you know how it goes.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.637
There's another difference

04:29.670 --> 04:31.872
between Sandy's family and me:
money.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.942
And I'll use everything I have
to get my son back.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.444
Make sure they know that.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.579
I'll make them
aware of that.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.683
What are you doing?

04:42.716 --> 04:44.752
Icing my 'nads.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.019
Excuse me?

04:46.053 --> 04:48.622
One of the patients
grabbed my junk.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.595
So Alex must be excited.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.963
What?

04:55.996 --> 04:58.065
Today is first day of
spring break, right?

04:58.098 --> 05:00.568
Oh, yeah, right.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.736
So you guys want to do
something after work?

05:02.770 --> 05:06.039
He's has been talking
about this rock and
roll bowling alley

05:06.073 --> 05:08.842
with glow-in-the-dark
balls and lasers.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.077
Uh, we can't.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.946
Not tonight.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.648
Alex's father is in town.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.684
He just showed up.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.885
Oh.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.720
Yeah, he does this
every now and then.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.522
Usually without warning.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.524
Kinda like a tornado.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.729
I wish he'd just
stay away for good.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.798
Oh, well, he's
the boy's father.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.932
Barely.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.434
He only sticks around
long enough

05:33.467 --> 05:35.736
to run up my phone bill
and drink all my beer.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.574
He's staying with you?

05:40.608 --> 05:41.842
( door opens )

05:41.875 --> 05:45.413
Somebody call
for a psych consult?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.680
You on psych now?

05:46.714 --> 05:47.881
Yep. But don't worry.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.483
I'm keeping an extra ID
in my pocket

05:49.517 --> 05:51.685
just in case someone mistakes me
for a patient.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.723
That was a joke.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.124
( chuckles nervously )

05:57.157 --> 06:00.093
She's in the Suture Room.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.169
MORRIS:
Give me the chart.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.738
It's my patient.
Have you done an H&P?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.005
I pulled the chart.
Have you done an H&P?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.441
What the hell
are you two doing now?

06:13.441 --> 06:14.442
He's trying to
steal my patient.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.843
What?
I'm trying to help you.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.010
Who are we talking about?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.046
Back pain in Two.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.117
I'll settle this.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.986
You three should be
ashamed of yourselves.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.987
Well, here's a beauty for you:

06:27.020 --> 06:28.622
Blue and puking in One.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.857
Blue?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.925
( coughing, retching )

06:33.527 --> 06:34.562
LOCKHART:
Okay, Mrs. Garrison.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.563
We're going
to take you upstairs

06:35.596 --> 06:36.564
and get you some lunch.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.898
I'm really not hungry,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.133
although I wouldn't mind
a nice glass of merlot.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.770
See what I can do.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.605
I'll try to get her admitted
for a few days.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.040
She'll be fine once she
gets back on her meds.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.476
How's the psych rotation?

06:48.476 --> 06:49.643
It's kinda scary.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.744
The patients?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.746
No, me. I like it.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.848
How about you,
everything good?

06:56.517 --> 06:59.052
Sam's ex-boyfriend's
back in town.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.160
CARTER:
Hey, Abby.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.796
Can you take
Mr. Chen here upstairs?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.631
Not unless you want
him admitted to psych.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.665
Oh, don't tempt me.

07:11.699 --> 07:12.700
Fall to an outstretched hand.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.801
It's nothing serious.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.102
Except it's his right arm

07:15.135 --> 07:16.236
and now he won't be able
to do anything,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.071
not that he would.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.074
I've already been through
four home care workers.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.743
I can help you out.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.677
I can't get any more
nursing shifts,

07:23.711 --> 07:25.212
I really need the money

07:25.245 --> 07:26.614
or I'm going to have to
drop out of school again.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.781
Abby, you don't want
any of this.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.082
( speaks Chinese )

07:29.116 --> 07:32.019
( speaks Chinese )

07:32.052 --> 07:34.688
( both arguing in Chinese )

07:34.722 --> 07:35.756
Coffee?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.958
Yeah, good idea.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.627
So...

07:39.660 --> 07:40.728
So...

07:40.761 --> 07:42.095
How's Kem?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.964
She must be getting big.

07:43.997 --> 07:44.998
Very.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.099
You should see Susan.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.267
How's she doing?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.169
Well, you know
how some mothers

07:49.202 --> 07:51.739
talk to their
unborn children?
Mm-hmm.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.641
Susan threatened
to pull hers out

07:53.674 --> 07:55.242
with her bare hands
if it didn't hurry up.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.277
You been doing
anything differently,

07:57.310 --> 07:58.646
exercising, sports?
No.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.180
Any heavy lifting?

08:00.213 --> 08:02.049
You help a friend move,
anything like that?
No.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.551
Slip or fall recently?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.653
Nothing.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.887
( giggles softly )

08:06.920 --> 08:08.722
Sorry, I'm just checking
your lymph nodes.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.757
I'm ticklish.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.659
I'll make
a note of that.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.562
You ever have
a mammogram?
No.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.064
You do self
breast exams?
Sometimes.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.232
Hey, Sam, can you
give me a hand.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.168
I need to perform
a breast exam on
Miss Campbell.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.003
Sure.
You do?

08:23.036 --> 08:25.673
It's just routine.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.675
Now you really
should do this every month.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.676
You have to get
to know your breasts.

08:28.709 --> 08:32.946
You can't rely
on friends.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.082
Right after your period
is the best time.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.750
Blood bank's on line six
for you, Sam.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.184
Thanks.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.854
All right, first you look
at yourself in the mirror

08:40.888 --> 08:42.322
This is Taggart.
for any changes in shape...

08:42.355 --> 08:43.924
Yeah, I drew blood on Mendoza.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.059
...dimpling, puckering
of the skin or nipple changes.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.128
You lift up your arm,
and you do it again.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.964
I signed all of them.
My initials are "S.T."

08:50.998 --> 08:53.166
Then you gently
squeeze the nipple

08:53.200 --> 08:54.935
to check for discharge.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.236
Okay.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.106
Now you start
by circling the nipple
Okay.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.341
moving out in large
and larger circles...

09:01.374 --> 09:02.943
Okay, it's been a
little busy down here.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.778
...feeling for any lumps
or bumps along the way

09:04.812 --> 09:06.313
until you reach
the outer edge.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.616
This guy needs two units
type and crossed right now.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.353
Be sure to feel
all the breast tissue.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.055
He's vomiting blood.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.090
Just beneath the skin
with a soft touch

09:17.124 --> 09:20.093
and down to the rib cage
with a firmer touch.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.697
From the collarbone
to the top of the abdomen,
Yeah.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.000
and from the armpit
to the midline.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.101
Do you want me
to come down there?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.937
I don't appreciate any masses.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.639
That's good, right?

09:31.639 --> 09:32.740
That's perfect.

09:32.773 --> 09:33.907
You can sit up.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.042
Forget it.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.209
Jut send two units O-neg.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.646
You should also do this
in the shower.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.748
Skin's a lot more slippery
when it's wet,

09:40.781 --> 09:44.384
and sometimes it helps.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.853
(man screaming):
Oh, make it stop!

09:45.886 --> 09:47.320
Oh, please, give me something!

09:47.354 --> 09:50.390
Connor, James, 28,
passenger in an MVA.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.660
Other car T-boned into them
pretty good on his side.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.393
Give me something!

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
KOVAC:
Vitals?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.064
He's been thrashing too much
for us to get a B.P.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.900
No LOC. He was walking
and swearing on the scene.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.302
Three centimeter temporal
lac with some glass.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.037
My arm is killing me, man!

10:04.071 --> 10:05.238
Come on!
Driver's right behind us.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.774
She got the worst of it.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.108
Where's Pratt?
Right here.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.176
Okay, this guy's yours.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.243
Neela, come with me.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.845
( man continues screaming )

10:11.879 --> 10:14.181
Seat belt and harness
airbag didn't deploy.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.749
Where do you hurt,
ma'am?

10:15.783 --> 10:16.817
All over.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.218
What happened, man?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.687
(panting):
We were just driving.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.888
Some guy blindsided us.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.022
Oh, God! Oh, God!

10:22.055 --> 10:23.323
Save my arm! Save my arm!

10:23.356 --> 10:24.958
You're not going
to lose your arm, sir.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.093
She your girlfriend?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.061
Naw, man,
I just met her last night.

10:28.095 --> 10:28.996
She was driving me home

10:29.029 --> 10:30.397
from her place.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.132
( crying ):
I should have taken a cab.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.333
Big closed deformity
on the right elbow.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.102
( yells )
He's dislocated.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.303
No radial pulse.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.304
A hundred of Brevital.
Brevital?

10:37.337 --> 10:38.872
Yeah, and a hundred of fent.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.307
All right, man,
just hang in there, okay?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.775
We're going
to fix this up real quick.

10:41.809 --> 10:42.676
( whimpers ):
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.144
What do we want, Neela?

10:44.177 --> 10:46.146
Full trauma panel, a set
of hemocues, and X rays.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.447
You want me to guess
which ones?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.182
Chest, c-spine and pelvis.
Thank you.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.350
I think I'm gonna be sick.
KOVAC:
On the monitor.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.885
MALIK:
Get suction.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.353
NEELA:
Periumbilical ecchymosis.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.088
Pretty tender in
the upper right.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.724
Systolic's 90.
First hemocue is 11.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.358
My head feels funny.
Okay, get another line.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.193
MALIK:
Already done with
a liter on board.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.362
( man yelling in other room )

11:02.395 --> 11:03.831
Is Dr. Pratt working?

11:03.864 --> 11:04.998
Okay,
two units of O-neg

11:05.032 --> 11:05.799
on the rapid infuser.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.867
Can you get him?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.068
MALIK:
Still tachy at 118.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.102
NEELA:
She's going to crash.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.739
Have a seven
and a half ready,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.040
and I need
the ultrasound.
I'll get it.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.307
Somebody
call surgery again.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.143
( hysterical whining )

11:16.176 --> 11:17.845
Brevital is in.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.179
It's not helping!

11:19.212 --> 11:20.313
It's not...!

11:20.347 --> 11:21.481
Thank, God.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.183
All right,
we got about 20 seconds.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.785
Pull.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.186
Dr. Pratt,
this patient's asking for you.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.187
For me?
( groans )

11:27.220 --> 11:28.922
He's waking up.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.190
Almost got it.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.825
( Pratt grunts )

11:31.859 --> 11:34.361
( groans, whines )

11:36.329 --> 11:37.765
What happened?

11:37.765 --> 11:39.099
We fixed your elbow.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.968
Holy crap, you're good.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.102
You can pick up
your Dr. Greg Pratt

11:42.135 --> 11:44.805
Fan Club ring at the door.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.208
MALIK:
Barely holding
at 100 systolic.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.342
Blood's running.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.778
Hypoechoic in Morrison's...

11:50.778 --> 11:51.912
How are we
doing in here?

11:51.945 --> 11:54.147
Greg, is that you?

11:54.181 --> 11:55.783
Yeah.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.985
RASGOTRA:
Foley is on.
Blood on the dip.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.820
What's the name on the chart?

11:59.853 --> 12:00.854
Rena Carlson.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.823
We hooked up last year.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.459
We met on the El, remember?

12:06.493 --> 12:07.928
Oh, yeah, right.

12:07.961 --> 12:08.962
KOVAC:
Okay, make sure

12:08.996 --> 12:10.330
the blood bank
gets a clot.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.332
Let's drop an NG tube
and pack her up.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.234
Rena, you injured
your spleen,

12:14.267 --> 12:16.236
and you're going
to require surgery to repair it.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.205
Oh, God.
I'm all messed up.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.807
PRATT:
No, you're going
to be okay.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.375
We're going to take
very good care of you.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.377
( sighs )

12:28.548 --> 12:29.817
Abby.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.884
Hi.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.285
I, uh, see
Mrs. Garrison is back.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.387
Yeah, she bit one of the
attendings in the ER.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.356
Well, better them
than one of us.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.125
Mr. Rosenblum was asking
for you.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.226
Oh, great.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.493
You should take it
as a compliment.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.829
It took me two years
before the Duke

12:41.862 --> 12:43.563
would even
talk to me.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.432
Maybe it's your
nursing background.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.535
It's probably a combination
of nursing and genetics.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.371
My family's
pretty high maintenance.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.841
You can lead
the group today.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.510
By myself?

12:57.544 --> 13:00.180
No better time
than the present.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.050
Okay.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.389
Hi.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.058
Hi. I'm Abby
Lockhart.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.592
I'm a medical
student,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.095
and I'm going
to be running
the group today.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.097
Ow!

13:17.130 --> 13:18.298
The elbow's good.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.067
Sutures will come out in a week.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.035
But the ortho clinic will want
to get some more X rays

13:22.069 --> 13:23.303
and start you on P.T.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.005
So, does that
mean I can go?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.606
Yeah, but you're not going
to stick around for her?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.208
Like I said, man,
I just met her.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.542
You spent the night
together, right?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.979
That don't make
us married.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.214
What's her status?

13:34.247 --> 13:35.916
Stable after four units

13:35.949 --> 13:37.951
of packed cells
and some fluid.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.252
Corday's waiting
for her upstairs.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.054
I have to have an operation.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.422
Don't worry.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.057
Dr. Corday's an
excellent surgeon.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.358
Will you come see me after?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.194
Sure.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.396
Friend?
Not really.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.464
Could you, uh, just
let me know how she does?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.366
Okay.
Thanks.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.003
Labs and films on Campbell.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.270
And Sussman is starting

13:57.304 --> 13:58.939
to get some
short-term memory back.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.207
Thanks.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.110
Neela?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.477
Neuro checks
on Mr. Sussman q hour.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.412
I can't. I'm working
at the lab at 4:00.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.613
Doing what?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.181
Stroke physiology
research.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.316
You're going to the mouse house?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.583
It's an elective.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.919
I'm doing a lousy
job down here.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.086
Everyone seems
to think

14:13.120 --> 14:14.354
I'm better suited
for the lab.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.356
Yeah, well, God forbid
you disappoint them.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.591
Hello.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.627
I'm sorry this has
taken so long.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.930
So, what's going
on with you, Denise?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.932
I've just... I've been feeling
pretty cruddy,

14:24.965 --> 14:28.001
like, um, sick to my stomach
and headaches.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.602
At first I thought
it was just the flu

14:29.636 --> 14:31.471
un-until I started
losing the feeling

14:31.504 --> 14:33.140
in my hands and my feet.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.575
So, you're not here
because of your skin?

14:35.608 --> 14:38.979
No. That's-That's
from the amiodarone.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.148
I have
a ventricular arrhythmia.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.251
It's pretty sad, huh?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.253
You know what the guys
at school call me?

14:46.286 --> 14:49.556
Smurf.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.658
Everything looks good.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.693
No fractures, no arthritis,
no bony lesions.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.196
I'm thinking it's probably
just muscle strain.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.331
But I told you
I didn't do anything.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.300
Maybe you didn't
realize it at the time.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.169
It may not have been
a sudden strain.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.038
You could have slept funny
or been sitting too long.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.041
That's it?

15:08.075 --> 15:10.177
Yeah. It should get
better with time.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.979
Try a warm bath
and some ibuprofen.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.413
Come back and see me
if it gets any worse,

15:13.446 --> 15:14.614
or you start to
feel numbness

15:14.647 --> 15:15.615
our weakness in your legs.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.649
BARDELLI:
Yo, doc!

15:16.683 --> 15:17.717
Excuse me.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.986
29-year-old woman

15:18.986 --> 15:20.453
with syncopal episode.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.089
Housekeeper heard a crash,
found her down in the kitchen.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.390
She on any meds?
Nothing we could find.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.992
Neela!

15:24.992 --> 15:25.993
Ma'am, can
you hear me?

15:26.026 --> 15:28.996
Ma'am?

15:28.996 --> 15:30.297
Excuse me.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.631
Could I speak with
someone in charge?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.133
What do you need, ma'am?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.267
Would it be
possible to speak

15:34.301 --> 15:35.335
with Dr. Pratt's
supervisor?

15:35.368 --> 15:37.604
Uh... yeah, okay.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.744
What are you doing here?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.246
Where's Alex?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.314
I thought
I'd take you to lunch.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.648
Where's Alex?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.217
He's showing one
of the doctors his guitar.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.153
( strumming )

15:53.186 --> 15:54.254
What, was this a bad idea?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.222
I can't just
leave for lunch.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.256
Well, I asked Alex.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.424
He said it would be all right.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.458
He's ten.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.559
ALEX:
Hey, Mom, look.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.760
He did it. Dad said

16:00.793 --> 16:03.030
he would buy me
a guitar, and he did.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.031
So I see.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.198
Uh, th-this is my dad.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.366
Hi.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.500
Hi.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.269
ALEX:
Isn't it cool?

16:09.302 --> 16:10.370
Do you know how to play, Luka?

16:10.403 --> 16:11.438
Uh, no.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.206
Well, my dad's in a band.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.242
Luka, your little old lady
stopped breathing again.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.543
Oh, um, it was
nice meeting you.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.478
You, too.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.280
Some old gal
stopped breathing?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.282
That can't be good.
People die in
here all the time.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.383
It's no big deal.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.584
( laughs )

16:24.617 --> 16:25.785
He already sounds
like a doctor.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.354
It's great.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.256
You going to play something
for me, buddy?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.390
This lady fainted
and is altered.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.159
What are we looking for?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.326
Normal sinus.
She's not
having an MI.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.627
Think about
the differential.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.429
No ectopy, QT interval
is not prolonged.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.630
QRS duration
is point one zero.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.099
Normal.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.402
Pupils equal and reactive.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.304
What's the common
final pathway in syncope?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.805
Low blood pressure.
I don't hear a murmur.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.474
No. It's the lack
of vital nutrient delivery

16:47.507 --> 16:49.376
to the brain stem reticular
activating system.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.511
Which is usually caused
by low blood pressure.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.213
Or hypoxia, or hypoglycemia.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.681
Abdomen is soft and nontender.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.084
So, what are we ordering, kids?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.418
CBC, lytes,
head CT.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.287
And a urine tox screen.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.521
And call a family member
to verify

17:01.554 --> 17:02.622
she's not on any meds.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.723
What medications cause

17:03.756 --> 17:04.723
orthostatic hypotension?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.227
Antihypertensives.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.261
Beta blockers, dig, diuretics,

17:08.295 --> 17:09.628
phenothiazines, nitrates,

17:09.662 --> 17:10.730
antidysrhythmics,
antidepressants,

17:10.762 --> 17:12.598
alcohol
and cocaine.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.833
You know, we don't have
to do this

17:13.866 --> 17:16.769
if you've got
something better to do.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.471
No. I've got the papers
right here.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.406
I'm just going to be stuck
at the hospital

17:20.440 --> 17:21.441
for another couple hours.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.809
Is there any way that

17:22.842 --> 17:24.310
you could have a notary,
uh, come here?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.478
( door opening )

17:25.512 --> 17:26.779
Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.748
Carter, I'm so sorry
I stranded you here.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.150
They're going
to admit him,

17:30.183 --> 17:31.418
so I can drive
you home now.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.785
( chuckles ):
I just arranged

17:32.819 --> 17:34.121
for somebody
to come over here

17:34.121 --> 17:35.488
with some papers for me to sign.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.190
Plus, I got to be at work
in a couple hours.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.491
I think I'm just going to stay.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.759
Okay, I just ruined your
whole day, didn't I?

17:39.792 --> 17:40.793
No. Don't worry about it.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.129
You can buy me lunch.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.430
You know what you can do?

17:43.463 --> 17:44.464
You can help me pick out
nursery colors.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.133
Hey, what do you think? Circus--

17:46.133 --> 17:47.567
colorful, fun,
developmentally stimulating.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.868
Oh.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.470
Aquatic-- soothing,
yet educational.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.704
Sort of for the young scientist.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.140
Or, jungle--

17:53.173 --> 17:54.441
environmentally
positive,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.543
a celebration of his
African heritage.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.479
If you had a baby,
which would...?

17:59.512 --> 18:02.215
I like the jungle.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.885
I'm sorry.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.254
I wasn't
even thinking.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.888
Yeah, Carter, no, it's okay.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.790
Don't worry about it.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.859
I mean, you know, sometimes
I forget about him myself.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.528
Actually, I think
that's when I feel the worst--

18:15.562 --> 18:17.164
when I realize
that I haven't thought

18:17.164 --> 18:18.498
about him in, like,
a week or so.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.533
You know,

18:20.567 --> 18:22.702
ever since my, um, mom died

18:22.735 --> 18:25.172
and my dad got sick, I, uh...

18:25.205 --> 18:27.307
I've been thinking
about him a lot.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.543
You know, when my dad goes,

18:30.577 --> 18:32.812
I'm not going
to have anyone else.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.516
No aunts, cousins.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.752
Nothing.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.489
Have you ever gone to see him?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.494
Maybe you should.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.397
Maybe I should have kept him.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.200
I mean,
he is three years old now.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.601
( laughs )

18:54.634 --> 18:56.736
( laughs )

18:58.371 --> 18:59.572
The nightmares have stopped.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.840
But I feel like killing myself.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.675
MAN:
Oh, so what else is new?

19:02.709 --> 19:03.843
I smell something.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.478
I can't smell anything.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.613
I developed anosmia
after my accident.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.880
Nobody
accidentally

19:07.914 --> 19:09.382
puts their
head in a
paint mixer.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.683
Well, let-let's
let Larry finish.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.319
MAN:
Why? It's the same
damn thing

19:12.352 --> 19:13.686
every week.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.821
I want to kill myself.
Blah, blah,

19:14.854 --> 19:16.323
blah, blah...

19:16.356 --> 19:18.225
He needs new material.
You need a soul.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.459
Please stop fighting.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.528
PujwI' Hivlu'chugh
quvbe'lu'

19:21.561 --> 19:22.695
What's-What's he saying?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.231
No one here speaks Klingon.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.898
MAN:
It's rather odd,
don't you think?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.534
Yeah. No. Uh, no.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.768
I think we should
just take a minute.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.237
Where did you go to school?

19:30.237 --> 19:31.604
What?

19:31.638 --> 19:32.605
I'm going back
to school.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.274
I want to be
a lawyer.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.542
Last week he wanted
to be a lion tamer.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.776
At least
he has goals beyond

19:36.809 --> 19:37.744
how many women
he can screw.

19:37.777 --> 19:38.611
Ooh, you jealous?

19:38.645 --> 19:39.579
Hey. Okay, okay.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.580
You're a pig.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.648
Oink.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.782
Stanley, if
you continue

19:42.815 --> 19:44.517
to disrupt
the group,

19:44.551 --> 19:46.619
I'm going to have to-to
ask you to-to leave.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.355
Oh, that's a
good idea.
Oh, that's

19:48.388 --> 19:49.622
a good idea.
That's what
you should do.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.258
Can't we all
just get along?
Yes.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.625
Is it just me,
or are we a pretty kooky bunch?

19:52.659 --> 19:53.993
Okay, that
word is...
I smell gas.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.795
Sit down, sit down.
Roger, sit down.

19:55.828 --> 19:56.763
When I become a lawyer,
I'm going to sue this hospital.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.331
You can't sit on a jury

19:58.365 --> 19:59.699
if you have multiple
personality disorder.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.000
Does anyone else
smell gas?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.369
It's coming from Larry.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.570
Why don't you shut up?

20:03.603 --> 20:04.571
Next time you cut yourself,

20:04.604 --> 20:05.572
start with your tongue.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.440
Oh, leave her alone.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.242
You have nothing...
Do us a favor
and slit your wrists.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.743
You have nothing
inside you.
You make everybody sick.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.379
( both talking
at once )
Hey!

20:17.717 --> 20:18.918
No.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.454
( speaking Klingon )

20:26.393 --> 20:27.627
You can't
smoke that
in here.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.761
It's against
the law.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.530
So is suicide.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.031
You've got an addiction.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.000
Well, I'm trying to quit.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.335
I'm allergic to smoke.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.603
It only takes
11 seconds

20:36.636 --> 20:38.004
for nicotine
to reach
your brain.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.672
There are 50
different kinds

20:39.706 --> 20:41.441
of carcinogens
in cigarettes.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.510
You better put that out
before somebody catches you.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.979
Stanley, what about you?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.349
Do you have a
problem with this?

20:50.783 --> 20:54.654
My mother died of lung cancer.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.823
It's a nasty habit.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.697
Well, now that
we've all agreed
on something,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.766
let's talk about personal goals.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.469
CAMPBELL:
I don't want to make a big deal
out of this.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.671
He just made me feel
pretty uncomfortable.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.340
How so?

21:13.373 --> 21:16.075
He did a breast exam,
and, I don't know,

21:16.108 --> 21:17.844
he seemed to enjoy it.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.680
Was there a nurse present?

21:20.713 --> 21:21.981
Yes. Um,

21:22.014 --> 21:23.416
it was her.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.786
Did you voice your concerns

21:26.819 --> 21:28.087
to Dr. Pratt?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.723
No. I guess
I was caught off guard.

21:30.757 --> 21:31.991
Well, I can
assure you

21:32.024 --> 21:33.960
he's a very
professional
physician.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.595
However, if you
want to file a
formal complaint...

21:35.628 --> 21:37.029
Oh, no. No.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.366
I-I don't want
to make a big deal out of this.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.533
I just felt

21:40.567 --> 21:41.734
I should tell someone.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.902
Maybe they could
speak with him.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.371
I'll speak to him.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.038
Thank you.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.407
Where's Pratt?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.575
With a patient.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.809
What do you need?

21:49.842 --> 21:50.843
I need Pratt.
Hey, Sam, hold up.

21:50.877 --> 21:51.944
Where are you going?

21:51.978 --> 21:53.546
I'm going to grab a quick bite

21:53.580 --> 21:54.981
with Alex and his dad.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.083
Did you assist Dr. Pratt
in examining Campbell,

21:57.116 --> 21:58.685
the woman in Curtain Two?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.119
Yeah.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.621
Was there anything unusual
about the exam?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.022
I don't think so. Why?

22:03.055 --> 22:04.591
He gave her a breast exam
for back pain.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.025
I don't know
what her chief complaint was.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.760
I was on the phone
with the blood bank

22:07.794 --> 22:08.995
and juggling five
other patients.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.630
Sounds like

22:10.663 --> 22:11.898
he TUBE'd her.

22:11.931 --> 22:12.899
She wasn't
intubated, Morris.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.133
No, no. You know a TUBE.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.768
T-U-B-E.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.870
Totally unnecessary
breast exam.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.006
You're such an ass.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.474
What was that?

22:21.508 --> 22:22.642
Sorry.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.076
No, not you.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.712
Where did you hear that term?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.114
I... I don't know.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.749
I didn't make it up.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.484
Well, who did?

22:40.092 --> 22:42.061
What-What
happened?

22:42.094 --> 22:43.563
Where's my
daughter?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.131
Your daughter's
with your neighbor.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.899
My name is Dr. Pratt.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.436
You fainted at home,
but all your tests look good.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.103
We checked your heart,
your lungs,

22:51.137 --> 22:52.505
and your brain.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.973
You're not anemic
or dehydrated,

22:54.006 --> 22:55.875
and all your electrolytes
are normal.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.143
I feel fine.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.911
Are you taking any medications?
No.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.747
Could be anything
over-the-counter--

23:00.780 --> 23:01.881
diet pills, cold medicine?

23:01.914 --> 23:03.115
Nothing.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.784
You ever have
any heart problems?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.453
Palpitations,
shortness of breath?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.054
I'm healthy.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.089
Anyone in your family
ever have seizures?

23:10.122 --> 23:13.660
I did when I was a kid,
but I grew out of them.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.928
How long ago was your last one?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.096
I don't know.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.665
Years and years.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.633
I was on
phenobarb until,

23:20.667 --> 23:21.801
like, fifth grade.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.503
They said I had epilepsy.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.638
But when I stopped
the medicine,

23:25.672 --> 23:26.673
they went away.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.840
I never had another one.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.075
That was almost 20 years ago.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.477
WEAVER:
Dr. Pratt,
can I see you

23:30.477 --> 23:31.511
for a second?

23:31.544 --> 23:32.479
Yup. Just give me a minute.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.480
Can I go home?

23:33.480 --> 23:34.080
I need you now.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.548
All right.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.816
I'll be right back.
Okay. I have

23:36.849 --> 23:38.585
a baby at home.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.120
I just need to run
a few more tests, okay?

23:41.153 --> 23:42.489
Here.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.656
What's up?

23:43.690 --> 23:45.124
Did you treat this patient?

23:45.157 --> 23:46.526
Yeah. Why?

23:46.559 --> 23:47.660
She basically accused you

23:47.694 --> 23:48.628
of sexual harassment.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.896
What?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.998
Did you "TUBE" her, Pratt?

23:52.031 --> 23:53.666
What?

23:53.700 --> 23:55.134
Well, that's
what you call it, isn't it?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.504
When you want to feel up
a good-looking patient.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.142
If she hires a lawyer,
you could be charged
with sexual harassment.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.211
If I'd found a lesion,
I would've saved her life.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.979
But you didn't.
So I'm being punished
because she's not sick?

24:07.013 --> 24:09.115
It's not about her condition.
It's about your behavior.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.050
There was nothing
wrong with my behavior.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.119
She had tenderness
over the fourth and
fifth lumbar vertebrae--

24:13.152 --> 24:16.122
bony tenderness--
and none over the
paraspinous muscles.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.658
I also felt a one
centimeter lymph
node in the axilla.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.827
Are you saying you weren't
the least bit attracted to her?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.162
Oh, come on, bone
pain and axillary
lymphadenopathy

24:23.195 --> 24:25.164
in a woman who's
never had a mammogram.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.133
You know damn
well you'd have
done the same thing.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.968
It's not about what you did.
It's about how you did it.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.970
I did it with a
nurse present,

24:31.003 --> 24:32.839
per hospital policy.
The patient felt
you were enjoying yourself.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.807
Oh, come on,
please, would you
give me a break?

24:34.841 --> 24:37.076
Have you ever
gotten turned on
giving a breast exam?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.778
I bet you don't even
have a nurse in the room
with you while you do it.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.279
I'm a woman.
Who sleeps with
other women.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.748
I've never TUBE'd
a patient.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.082
Yeah, well,
neither have I.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.017
You coined the phrase.
No, I did not.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.819
That phrase has
been around since
I was a student.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.555
You've been overheard using it
on more than one occasion.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.557
So what? It doesn't
mean that I've done it.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.858
And if she was so
uncomfortable with
what I was doing,

24:51.891 --> 24:53.092
how come she didn't
say something?

24:53.125 --> 24:54.761
Maybe she was intimidated
by you.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.763
Oh, right, scared that
the big black doctor

24:56.796 --> 24:58.264
was going to bend
her over the bed...
Oh, don't you dare

24:58.297 --> 25:00.633
turn this
into a race issue.
Oh, no, no, no.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.168
When you're black, it's
always a race issue.
I'm not going to let you

25:02.201 --> 25:03.903
hide behind that.
I'm not hiding
behind anything.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.171
Dr. Weaver,
call for you.
Take a message.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.138
It's your lawyer,
line four.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.173
Don't go anywhere.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.307
Where's Sam?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.576
I think she's with her son.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.577
Hey, Dr. Pratt.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.679
Neela's patient collapsed.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.181
She was coming back
from the restroom.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.849
Ma'am, can you hear me?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.217
All right,
somebody find Neela!

25:18.250 --> 25:19.852
Let's get her
up on the gurney, okay?

25:19.886 --> 25:23.055
Ready? One, two...

25:23.089 --> 25:24.290
Malik, monitors.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.892
MALIK:
Positive sternotomy sign.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.594
What happened?
She's in v-tach.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.295
She has a ventricular
arrhythmia.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.698
She's on amiodarone.
Tetrology of Fallot,
repaired in 1975.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.032
Why's she in today?

25:33.065 --> 25:34.867
Flu symptoms.
What's her labs show?

25:34.901 --> 25:36.235
They haven't come back yet.
Need another set of hands?

25:36.268 --> 25:37.704
Did you open your
big mouth to Weaver?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.038
MALIK:
Can't get a pulse ox.
What?

25:39.071 --> 25:40.707
Airway's clear.
Start bagging.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.808
Did you tell Weaver
I TUBE'd a patient?

25:41.841 --> 25:43.275
RASGOTRA:
V-tach, no pulse.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.977
Come on, Denise,
stay with us.
Charge to 200.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.713
I'm charged.
Clear.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.047
MALIK:
No change.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.749
Going again. 300.
Well, did you?

25:49.782 --> 25:50.783
No!

25:50.817 --> 25:51.350
Somebody did, though.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.019
Clear.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.855
Sinus.
RASGOTRA:
Good carotid pulse.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.757
100 of lidocaine.
What'd you say to her?

25:57.790 --> 25:59.992
Nothing! Uh, that that
hot patient was complaining

26:00.026 --> 26:01.628
about you.
MALIK:
Good breath sounds.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.663
I'll call about her labs.
Perhaps the fact

26:03.696 --> 26:05.632
that you two are
referring to a patient
as "hot" is a clue

26:05.665 --> 26:07.867
to the problem.
First of all, I
never called her that,

26:07.900 --> 26:09.769
so she's the one
with the problem.
Oh, really?

26:09.802 --> 26:11.738
Can you even imagine
what it was like for
her to come here?

26:11.771 --> 26:13.239
She's feeling ill,
worried, scared.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.941
Probably waited several
hours to be seen,

26:14.974 --> 26:16.743
only to have a stranger
fondle her breasts.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.278
Secondary survey.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.914
( coughs )

26:21.948 --> 26:23.382
Good gag. She's waking up.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.251
You're okay, Denise.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.919
Labs?
CBC, electrolytes,

26:26.953 --> 26:28.721
calcium, L.F.T.s,
creatinine...

26:28.755 --> 26:31.090
Lab reports her amiodarone
level less than zero.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.391
She said she sometimes forgets
to take it.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.093
She must've
stopped taking it

26:34.126 --> 26:36.095
a few weeks ago to
have a level of zero.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.296
She give any indication
why she would do
something like that?

26:37.329 --> 26:39.866
Maybe because men are idiots.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.670
ALEX:
Can I play pinball?

26:43.670 --> 26:46.072
Sure.
Uh, finish
your lunch first.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.774
I'm full.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.175
You barely touched
your hamburger.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.943
I don't want to get
mad cow disease.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.680
Then finish your fries.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.315
God, he's grown a foot

26:56.348 --> 26:57.984
since I've seen him last.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.419
It's been a year.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.689
You've done a great job, Sam.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.025
He's a cool kid.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.327
Thanks.

27:08.360 --> 27:13.866
I guess I can't take
much credit for that.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.168
Anyway, is he, uh,
doing good in school?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.336
Yeah...

27:17.369 --> 27:18.971
when he's not
being expelled

27:19.005 --> 27:20.840
for performing medical
procedures on himself

27:20.873 --> 27:24.010
or dissecting dead squirrels
in the schoolyard.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.144
Really?

27:25.177 --> 27:26.879
It's not funny.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.982
He seems to like that,
uh, Russian doctor.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.884
Croatian.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.820
You two, uh...?

27:33.853 --> 27:37.089
We've gone out.
Nothing serious.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.325
Does he have any
friends his own age?

27:39.358 --> 27:41.327
Yeah, he's got some buddies
at school.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.429
That's good, considering
how much you guys move
around, that's good.

27:43.462 --> 27:47.399
Well... you got to go
where the work is, right?

27:47.433 --> 27:49.168
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.103
That's the good
thing about Chicago.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.739
Always building...
How long are you planning
on staying?

27:54.340 --> 27:55.908
You sick of me already?

27:55.942 --> 27:58.778
It's not about me.
It's about Alex.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.280
Well, he seems happy
that I'm back.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.849
That's the problem.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.316
The longer you stay,
the harder

28:04.350 --> 28:06.185
it's going to be on him
when you leave.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.955
Well, maybe I won't leave
this time.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.759
KOVAC:
What's going on

28:12.792 --> 28:15.027
with Hollis in Two?
Cardiology was supposed to come
get him an hour ago.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.328
Call them again.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.830
What about Dunn
in Exam Three?

28:17.864 --> 28:18.865
Some sort of recurrent
seizure disorder.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.366
I'm waiting on an E.E.G.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.834
They can do that
upstairs after
she's admitted.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.269
We need to free
up some beds.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.037
Medicine won't take her.
Why not Neurology?

28:25.071 --> 28:26.773
They don't think
she had a seizure.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.875
Was there, uh, witnessed
tonic-clonic activity?

28:28.908 --> 28:30.877
Not really.
Did she bite her tongue?

28:30.910 --> 28:33.045
No.
Was there
urinary incontinence?

28:33.079 --> 28:34.280
I don't think so.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.882
Then she didn't have
a seizure.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.784
Discharge her, and she can have
an outpatient E.E.G.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.385
If she passes out again,
she could hurt herself.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.020
So send in a D.M.V. card.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.055
There's also a baby at
home who could get hurt.

28:43.089 --> 28:46.392
Look, she had
a syncopal episode,

28:46.425 --> 28:49.295
and I'm going to rule her out
for M.I., so while we wait

28:49.328 --> 28:52.098
for the six hour troponin,
might as well throw on an E.E.G.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.067
Dr. Pratt, Denise's
parents are coming
in to talk to her,

28:55.101 --> 28:56.402
and I spoke with
her cardiologist.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.237
He's going to
switch to sotolol,

28:58.270 --> 28:59.238
which should help
with her skin.
Hey, Neela?

28:59.271 --> 29:00.406
When's your, uh,

29:00.439 --> 29:01.908
research rotation start?

29:01.941 --> 29:03.075
15 minutes.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.343
Good luck.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.445
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.247
Hey, let me ask you
a question.
Yeah.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.549
When you do a breast exam
on an attractive woman,

29:10.582 --> 29:11.918
it's awkward, right?

29:11.951 --> 29:14.320
For you and the patient.
Right.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.823
Yeah, see, I'm just as nervous
and uncomfortable as they are.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.291
I don't know-- maybe it comes
across as something else.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.860
What do you mean?

29:20.893 --> 29:22.561
How do you do it
so that they don't think

29:22.594 --> 29:24.263
that you're
enjoying yourself?

29:24.296 --> 29:27.299
Well, it's a... it's
a medical procedure.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.469
It's, uh, no different
than looking for
rebound or guarding.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.272
MORRIS:
I pretend
it's my mom.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.941
Yeah, it's a little trick
I picked up

29:34.974 --> 29:36.408
from my OB/GYN attending.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.578
It works... I mean,
unless your mom's hot, too.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.949
You're a freak.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.584
Every workstation
has its own microfuge.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.120
We share the ultracentrifuge.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.289
Cold room for tissue
culture media,

29:50.322 --> 29:52.491
bacterial plates,
DNA ligations.

29:52.524 --> 29:55.494
Arun and Angelie are
looking at expression

29:55.527 --> 29:58.264
of heat-shock proteins
in glial cells.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.299
This is Neela.

30:00.332 --> 30:03.135
Hi. Is that
an electron microscope?

30:03.169 --> 30:05.504
Yeah. E.M.'s kind
of old school

30:05.537 --> 30:07.306
for showing apoptosis
in neurons,

30:07.339 --> 30:09.508
but, you know, looks
sexy on the page,

30:09.541 --> 30:11.477
so Lundgren
still likes it.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.412
Lundgren?
Dr. Lundgren,

30:13.445 --> 30:16.849
the guy whose huge
R-0-1 grant is
funding your butt.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.484
I'm not getting paid.
It's rotational.

30:18.517 --> 30:19.986
I'm a fourth year
med student.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.287
I'm an eighth year,
PhD program.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.455
Eight years? God.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.858
Yeah, we don't get
credit around here for
wiping snotty noses.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.493
I've actually got to discover
something new

30:27.526 --> 30:29.628
in neuroscience
in order to get my degree.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.931
Takes a while.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.432
I'm supposed to be
helping with some
kind of stroke study?

30:33.465 --> 30:36.335
Okay. Well, everyone here
is researching some aspect

30:36.368 --> 30:38.537
of brain hypoperfusion
and tissue injury.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.506
You're going to be
with Yuri and me.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.341
We're looking at the
effects of ketamine

30:42.374 --> 30:44.944
on cerebral ischemia and
tissue damage in mice.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.546
Yuri, Neela.
Neela, Yuri.
Hey.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.917
No one said anything
about working with animals.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.986
Is that a problem?

30:54.020 --> 30:55.922
All the tests look good,

30:55.955 --> 30:57.890
but we'd like to
figure out why she
had a seizure.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.491
Yeah, I-I thought
that was something

30:59.525 --> 31:01.027
she outgrew as a kid.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.494
May be totally
unrelated.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.330
Here we go.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.934
What's all of that?

31:07.967 --> 31:10.569
We're doing an E.E.G. to monitor
her electrical brain activity.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.471
It takes several hours,
some of which is done

31:12.504 --> 31:14.340
while sleeping.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.975
Can I stay with her?

31:16.008 --> 31:18.377
Sure, just try
not to wake her up.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.446
We're more likely to pick up
the seizures when she's asleep.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.448
Thank you.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.952
You hear that: we
got to let your
mama sleep, okay?

31:27.586 --> 31:29.588
Hey. You know...

31:29.621 --> 31:33.092
when I ask you to
assist me on an exam
of a female patient,

31:33.125 --> 31:35.327
it's so that I don't
get accused of things
I didn't do.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.129
Ooh, don't blame me
for this.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.098
You were right there.
I didn't do anything.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.232
I did everything I
could to put that
patient at ease.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.367
Guess it didn't work.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.135
I was trying
to be friendly.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.571
One man's friendly is
another woman's creepy.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.573
You're a flirt, Pratt--
you can't help yourself.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.241
I wasn't flirting.
I was breaking the ice.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.610
It's a breast exam,
not a cocktail party.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.412
You don't have
to break the ice.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.214
Nice package,
by the way.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.715
What?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.550
Your package. Amira and I
were noticing earlier.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.452
Must be those pants.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.454
Okay, I see what you're trying
to do, and you're way off, okay?

32:02.488 --> 32:05.291
I didn't say anything
even remotely inappropriate
to that woman.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.259
But it was going
through your head.
No, it wasn't.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.428
You weren't thinking
about what a great
rack she had

32:09.461 --> 32:11.097
when you were
examining her?
Hell, no,

32:11.130 --> 32:13.432
and even if I was,
which I wasn't, so what?

32:13.465 --> 32:15.401
She can't read
my mind.
Of course she can.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.103
We all can-- it's
not that difficult,
believe me.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.171
You're a guy.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.607
Men only think
about three things:
food, sports and sex.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.142
Dogs are more
mysterious.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.144
If they ever invent
a refrigerator

32:25.177 --> 32:27.579
with a wide screen
TV and a vagina,
we're all doomed.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.181
Yeah, okay.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.449
You think I'm
kidding, but I'm not.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.451
When you
check us out,

32:32.484 --> 32:34.186
you might as well
be asking us to
show you our tits,

32:34.220 --> 32:35.387
because that's
what it feels like,

32:35.421 --> 32:36.755
and believe me, it's
not a nice feeling.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.290
I didn't check her out.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.459
Dr. Pratt, your patient's
seizing again.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.660
All right,
find Kovac.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.762
Jordan?
Push two of Ativan!

32:43.795 --> 32:46.332
I knew it.
MALIK:
Pulse ox 97.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.300
Up the nasal oxygen
to five liters.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.036
What's happening
to her?!

32:50.036 --> 32:52.204
Malik, another two of Ativan,
and mix up dilantin.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.672
She's going
to be okay.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.307
Just give the medicine
a chance to work.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.176
How long
has she been seizing?

32:57.209 --> 32:58.744
Less than a minute.
I just stepped out
for a second.

32:58.777 --> 33:01.647
NICK:
It's okay...
it's okay, Jordan.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.050
It's okay...
you're okay...

33:05.417 --> 33:07.153
Caught the seizure
on the E.E.G.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.388
Is this just going
to keep happening?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.123
She'll need to go on
the anticonvulsant
medication, but after that,

33:11.157 --> 33:12.691
everything should be fine.
KOVAC:
See any spikes?

33:12.724 --> 33:14.460
Not yet.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.594
Can she hear me?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.229
Sure. You can talk to her,

33:17.263 --> 33:18.564
but she's not going to be awake
for a while.

33:18.597 --> 33:22.168
Hey, sweetie... it's me.

33:22.201 --> 33:23.602
I'm here with Caroline.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.504
Everything's
going to be okay.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.639
You're doing good.

33:27.673 --> 33:28.807
Dr. Pratt?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.109
I'll be right back.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.078
She's going to be fine.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.182
Looks like Neurology
can't refuse to admit her now.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.683
That wasn't a
real seizure.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.817
What are you
talking about?

33:38.850 --> 33:41.187
The E.E.G. doesn't lie.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.356
No focal spikes, no
sharp waves, and no
spike-wave complexes.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.358
She was faking it?

33:46.392 --> 33:48.494
She had a
pseudo-seizure.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.629
Call Psychiatry.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.573
Legh Sott wa'leS.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.345
Ghaj a QaQ ram, Hawthorne.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.250
( growls )

34:13.219 --> 34:14.453
I learned a little Klingon.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.121
That's good.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.556
And we had to get rid of
our Klingon translator

34:17.589 --> 34:18.556
in the most recent
round of budget cuts.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.192
( chuckles )

34:20.226 --> 34:21.493
You're serious.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.329
My buddy's hospital
in Seattle

34:23.362 --> 34:25.764
had to hire someone who
speaks Elven-- full time.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.599
Thank you, Mr. Tolkien.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.501
So that was an interesting
approach today.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.438
Yeah, um... I'm sorry...

34:32.471 --> 34:36.842
Look, I know it's cruel throwing
students into a group like that,

34:36.875 --> 34:39.578
but it is a good indicator
of who has what skills.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.413
I-I was kind of freaked out.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.614
I've never seen them respond
to a student

34:43.649 --> 34:45.284
the way they did to you.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.818
Of course,
they've never seen

34:46.851 --> 34:48.654
anyone show as much disregard

34:48.687 --> 34:50.322
for hospital policy.

34:50.356 --> 34:51.822
I think you
scared them.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.360
You kinda scared me.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.795
( beeping )

34:58.464 --> 35:00.266
I'm being paged to the ER.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.568
Yeah, we could
try hypnosis.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.170
On who?

35:04.170 --> 35:06.505
You. Might help
you quit smoking.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.475
Mmm. I'll get back
to you on that.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.610
PRATT:
I told her to look
for any changes

35:11.643 --> 35:13.479
in the shape or size
of the breast

35:13.512 --> 35:15.447
and I felt for any lumps.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.284
I told her to watch out
for dimpling and puckering
of the skin.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.651
This is stupid.
Continue.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.852
( sighs )

35:20.886 --> 35:22.621
Told her to check
for discharge.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.523
then to gently
squeeze the n...

35:24.556 --> 35:25.691
Jerry.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.193
I can't help it.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.827
My nipples
are sensitive.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.629
What?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.764
Your lawyer, Mr. Brooks,
is here.

35:32.798 --> 35:33.732
Excuse me.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.634
So, are we done here?

35:35.667 --> 35:38.637
No. I want you to prepare a
lecture for the med students

35:38.670 --> 35:41.473
on gender sensitivity
in the physical examination.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.775
Abby's down from psych
for your patient.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.846
Pardon me.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.681
Yeah.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.883
Do you mind?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.852
Bored yet?

35:53.885 --> 35:56.255
Actually, I find it
extremely interesting.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.757
I prefer working with empirical
data over patients.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.292
Not a people person?

36:00.326 --> 36:02.328
Not when they're sick.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.230
Watch it! ( groans )

36:04.230 --> 36:05.531
Sorry...

36:05.564 --> 36:06.932
You contaminated my eliza!

36:06.965 --> 36:08.500
You shouldn't have
coffee in the lab.

36:08.534 --> 36:09.901
I always have coffee
in the lab.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.637
You just ruined
my sample.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.971
Do you have to rerun it?

36:13.004 --> 36:15.474
Can't.
Don't have any serum left.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.743
You just set us back
six weeks.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.412
PRATT:
I don't know,
maybe she's faking it.

36:20.446 --> 36:23.282
Well, she's not faking if
it's a conversion reaction.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.351
There was nothing on the EEG.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.686
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean her symptoms are
under voluntary control.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.622
I mean, whatever's happening to
her is on a subconscious level,

36:30.656 --> 36:32.658
maybe due to
some sublimated
emotional trauma.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.626
Would you listen
to Miss Freud over here.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.263
Okay, okay, so what
are we talking about,
postpartum depression?

36:37.296 --> 36:39.731
Maybe. In some women,
it can turn into full-
blown psychosis.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.267
Hey, where are you
going, Mrs. Dunn?

36:41.300 --> 36:42.834
Home.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.671
Mrs. Dunn, hi, I'm Abby Lockhart
from Psychiatry...

36:45.704 --> 36:46.705
I already told him.

36:46.738 --> 36:47.673
I don't need a shrink.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.974
I have to go.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.909
My husband's waiting
for me in the car.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.544
Jordan, if you don't stay,

36:52.578 --> 36:53.945
we can't help you.

36:53.979 --> 36:57.416
That was my easiest
consult all day.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.451
( chuckles )

36:59.485 --> 37:01.287
Remember to get your
prescription filled,
Mrs. Epstein.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.690
Hey.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.292
I got these back today.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.794
( laughing )

37:08.827 --> 37:11.297
Oh, my God.
Look at you guys.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.431
Yeah, you can
keep those.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.599
I got double prints.

37:13.632 --> 37:14.700
Thanks.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.835
Good night.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.371
Luka.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.976
I didn't know he was coming.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.013
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.490
Hey, how did Rena
Carlson make out?

37:38.524 --> 37:40.025
MVA, came up
for an exlap.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.860
Mm, she had a lot
of clot in the belly.

37:41.893 --> 37:42.994
We had to take out
the spleen, I'm afraid.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.397
What about the liver?

37:45.431 --> 37:47.032
Good. Mesenteric arteries
are fine.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.534
Kidneys, too.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.901
She's a lucky girl.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.503
She should be awake
by now.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.339
I think she's in ten.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.940
Thanks.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.877
You working banker's
hours now?

37:58.910 --> 38:01.680
Hardly. I only stepped out
of surgery once today

38:01.713 --> 38:02.881
and that was to pee.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.383
I'm sorry to hear that--

38:04.416 --> 38:05.884
for you and your bladder.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.519
Are you up
for some dinner?

38:07.553 --> 38:08.920
Tonight? I can't.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.556
You can't eat?

38:10.589 --> 38:11.857
Not with you.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.759
Oh, really?

38:15.427 --> 38:17.563
What's wrong?

38:17.596 --> 38:19.965
Who's that, a patient?

38:19.998 --> 38:22.401
Um, it's difficult
to talk about.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.935
Sounds serious.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.872
Could be, I still have
some tests to run.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.474
Is there anything
I can do to help?

38:28.507 --> 38:30.509
No, no, nothing.
I think I'd better go.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.810
Hey.

38:31.843 --> 38:32.944
Oh, what are
you doing here?

38:32.978 --> 38:33.912
I thought
I'd surprise you.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.914
Well, you certainly did.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.917
Hey.

38:40.486 --> 38:44.690
Dr. Jeremy Lawson,
um, Mr. David Spencer.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.392
Mr. Spencer.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.026
How's it going?

38:48.059 --> 38:49.961
It's going very
well, thank you.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.963
Have a good evening,
Dr. Corday.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.500
It was nice meeting you.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.938
What's with the
James Bond routine?

38:59.971 --> 39:00.939
He's English.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.674
Oh, that's nice--

39:02.708 --> 39:04.810
a little taste of home.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.412
Mmm.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.983
Dr. Weaver, I'm sorry
to bother you about this,

39:12.017 --> 39:13.985
but if I don't get
more nursing shifts,

39:14.019 --> 39:17.122
I'm not going to be able to pay
for my spring tuition.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.125
Are you okay?

39:22.494 --> 39:24.430
Kerry, why don't you take
some time off?

39:24.430 --> 39:26.632
You need to give yourself
some time to grieve.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.767
I don't have that luxury.

39:28.800 --> 39:32.971
I lost my wife, and now I'm
fighting to keep my son.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.741
I'm sorry.

39:35.774 --> 39:39.010
I've been begging and arguing
with lawyers all day

39:39.044 --> 39:41.112
just to get Henry
for the weekend.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.149
They're "granting" me two days
with my son.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.919
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

39:47.953 --> 39:49.655
Thank you, and, uh...

39:49.688 --> 39:52.023
don't worry about
your tuition--

39:52.057 --> 39:53.592
it's been paid.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.627
What?

39:55.661 --> 39:59.531
Yeah, the registrar said it's
been paid through graduation.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.006
You need to sign this.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.140
What is it?

40:09.174 --> 40:11.042
Uh, it's a visitation agreement.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.012
Basically, it says you'll
return Henry to the Lopezes

40:14.045 --> 40:15.447
by Monday at noon.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.690
Hey, baby.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.526
Hi!

40:27.559 --> 40:28.927
Hello, baby!

40:28.960 --> 40:30.796
There you are.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.498
How are you, huh?

40:32.531 --> 40:34.132
He's been a little fussy.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.834
Maybe he's teething.

40:35.867 --> 40:39.037
Yeah, I don't think so.
It's too early, isn't it?

40:39.070 --> 40:41.206
You don't have any teeth,
do you?

40:41.239 --> 40:43.074
You just miss your mommy.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.776
That's my baby.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.745
Not all of us think
the way my parents do.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.980
They're pretty
old-fashioned.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.482
I know Sandy would
be really pissed

40:50.516 --> 40:51.617
if she knew
what was happening.

40:51.650 --> 40:55.253
She'd be cursing
up a storm.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.889
I know she'd want you
and Henry to be together.

40:57.923 --> 41:01.059
I hope it works out
for the two of you,
that's all.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.662
Thank you.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.798
Thank you.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.567
That's my boy.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.236
That's my beautiful baby.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.045
What?

41:20.078 --> 41:21.146
What are you doing?

41:21.179 --> 41:22.781
Waiting for an ambulance.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.015
Carter...
What?

41:24.049 --> 41:25.250
I'm not taking your money.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.652
What are you talking about?

41:26.685 --> 41:28.119
You know
what I'm talking about,

41:28.153 --> 41:29.955
and I'm not one
of your charities.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.123
Oh, I was hoping to count
you as one of my friends.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.025
Well, neither a borrower
nor a lender be.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.694
Abby, I'm not loaning
you the money.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.195
I'm giving it to you.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.164
I want you to think
of it as an investment

41:39.197 --> 41:40.632
in the future
of medicine.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.934
You'd be better off
with tech stocks.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.971
You know, in the time
it's taken us to have
this little conversation,

41:46.004 --> 41:49.274
I've made your salary for the
rest of your life-- in interest.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.711
Wow, when you
put it that way,

41:52.744 --> 41:55.146
how about a couple extra grand
for a new car?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.682
( motorcycle approaches )

41:58.884 --> 42:00.285
Uh, hey, hey, you
can't park there.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.687
This is where we bring
the ambulances.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.154
He's with me.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.292
And I will pay you back.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.031
You know, you both
should be wearing helmets.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.248
My throat hurts.

42:30.281 --> 42:32.317
It's from being intubated.

42:34.152 --> 42:35.754
I didn't think
you'd come.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.188
I said I would.

42:37.222 --> 42:41.026
I think you said
you'd call me, too.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.264
Well, this place
keeps me pretty busy.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.335
You don't remember
me, do you, Greg?

42:54.172 --> 42:56.341
That's okay.

42:58.176 --> 43:01.880
Is there anybody
you'd like me to call?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.716
My mom lives
in Detroit.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.317
Her last name's
Henderson--

43:06.351 --> 43:09.655
Julie Henderson.

43:09.688 --> 43:13.024
I'll write the number down
if you've got a pen.
