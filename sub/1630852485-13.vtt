WEBVTT

00:01.894 --> 00:05.212
(siren wailing)

00:09.010 --> 00:11.635
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:19.186 --> 00:21.186
Can you tell us what happened?

00:21.338 --> 00:22.913
Not another car on the road

00:22.931 --> 00:25.357
and this gal comes
swerving into my lane.

00:25.509 --> 00:26.508
My truck jackknifed

00:26.694 --> 00:29.419
and now I've got
15,000 pounds of hay to pick up.

00:29.438 --> 00:31.772
Alright, Judd, why don't you
close down those two lanes?

00:31.924 --> 00:33.590
Marjan, get the jaws.

00:33.609 --> 00:36.851
Paul, Mateo, inch and a half
of protective line.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.445
The scene is
extremely combustible.

00:38.597 --> 00:41.098
One spark,
this hay goes up like tinder.

00:41.116 --> 00:42.449
Hi, ma'am. My name is Owen.

00:42.526 --> 00:44.359
This is Tommy and TK.
They're gonna take care of you.

00:44.436 --> 00:47.254
-Are you in any pain?
-Numb mostly.

00:48.198 --> 00:49.239
Can you tell us what happened?

00:49.241 --> 00:51.032
Something darted
in front of my car.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.051
I think it was a deer.

00:52.127 --> 00:53.293
-Did I hit it?
-Don't see any deer.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.279
-Good.
-Hey, can you tell me your name?

00:55.281 --> 00:56.963
Carrie.
I think my legs are pinned.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.099
They're tingling,
like they went to sleep.

01:00.377 --> 01:02.877
Okay. I'm gonna
check your neck right quick.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.879
Just be very, very
still for me, okay?

01:04.899 --> 01:06.473
Definitely feeling
some crepitus.

01:06.625 --> 01:07.382
Be careful with the collar.

01:07.643 --> 01:09.551
-Craptus? What's craptus?
-Crepitus.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.478
Means there's
some free-floating vertebrae.

01:11.555 --> 01:14.314
It indicates that your neck
might be broken.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.466
-Oh, God.
-It's alright.

01:16.485 --> 01:19.303
Carrie, can you tell me if you
can feel me touching your leg?

01:19.305 --> 01:20.971
Yes, but it's fuzzy.
Is that bad?

01:21.064 --> 01:22.063
No, no, no, that's good.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.916
It means that
there's some swelling,

01:24.067 --> 01:25.250
but your spine is intact.

01:25.402 --> 01:27.311
Alright, just need you
to hold very, very still,

01:27.329 --> 01:29.296
-so try not to--
-(sneezes)

01:30.073 --> 01:32.316
CARRIE: Ow. (sneezes)

01:32.334 --> 01:35.485
-(sneezes)
-Carrie, do you
have any allergies?

01:35.487 --> 01:36.153
Hay fever.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.930
That's unfortunate.

01:38.081 --> 01:39.914
Alright. Bone shards
are shifting with every sneeze.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.249
We need to get her
out of here fast

01:41.268 --> 01:43.585
before one of those
slices her spinal cord.

01:43.662 --> 01:44.919
Marjan?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.087
MARJAN:
Jaws are flying in, Cap.

01:46.165 --> 01:47.497
-(sneezes)
-TK.

01:47.499 --> 01:48.515
-Push 50 mils of Diphen.
-Copy.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.642
Carrie, we're gonna
give you an antihistamine,

01:50.794 --> 01:52.945
but it's very important
that you do everything
that you can not...

01:53.096 --> 01:54.947
-(sneezes)-
...to sneeze.

01:55.023 --> 01:56.173
How am I supposed to do that?

01:56.191 --> 01:57.765
-Right. Say, "Purple elephant."
-What?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.118
OWEN: My grandma
used to make me say that.

01:59.269 --> 02:02.287
It's impossible to sneeze
while you're saying that.

02:02.364 --> 02:05.182
Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.517
Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.

02:07.536 --> 02:08.460
Purple elephant.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.507
...elephant. Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.042
One, two, three.

02:16.195 --> 02:17.469
Alright, Judd,
let's get a KED in there.

02:17.621 --> 02:18.879
Strap her in.

02:19.031 --> 02:21.214
-Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.
-JUDD: Okay.

02:21.367 --> 02:22.724
-Purple elephant.
-Easy.

02:24.203 --> 02:26.794
Carrie, we're gonna
lift you out now.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.814
Alright, everybody, no jolts.

02:28.965 --> 02:30.874
Smooth as glass.

02:30.876 --> 02:33.226
On my count.
One, two...

02:33.320 --> 02:35.045
CARRIE:
Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.

02:35.063 --> 02:36.229
-Purple elephant.
-...three.

02:36.382 --> 02:38.064
Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.

02:38.141 --> 02:39.324
-Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.
-Easy.

02:39.401 --> 02:40.975
-CARRIE: Purple elephant.
-OWEN: Easy.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.536
CARRIE:
Purple elephant.
Purple elephant.

02:44.072 --> 02:46.206
-OWEN: Well done.
-Purple elephant.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.243
(siren wailing)

02:50.396 --> 02:53.630
Hey, Judd, I'm gonna
call Street Services,
get all this cleaned up.

02:55.751 --> 02:57.250
Hey, anybody lose a shoe?

02:57.327 --> 02:59.428
PAUL:
No, man, nobody lost a shoe.

03:05.093 --> 03:06.685
How about a foot?

03:08.355 --> 03:09.438
Whoa.

03:11.934 --> 03:13.174
So not a deer.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.434
We have another victim!

03:14.586 --> 03:16.937
Let's check the road.
Both shoulders.

03:17.013 --> 03:18.197
Cap, there's a clip on this.

03:18.273 --> 03:19.180
I think it's a cycling shoe.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.182
Alright, he's a cyclist.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.868
(stammers)
What do I do
with this, Cap?

03:22.945 --> 03:25.429
Uh, should I just hold it,
or-or something?

03:25.431 --> 03:27.664
Put it in a box,
get it on cold packs.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.621
Hey, Cap, we got the bike.

03:34.698 --> 03:35.956
So if the foot is there

03:36.032 --> 03:38.258
and the bike
is over there then... Cap?

03:39.945 --> 03:41.536
Looking for a cyclist
in a haystack.

03:41.613 --> 03:44.264
Everybody,
grab the rubbish hooks.
Start digging.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.392
<i> ♪ I'm gonna find her </i>

03:47.895 --> 03:48.969

I got blood here, man.

04:13.662 --> 04:14.995
-It's going this way.
-JUDD: Yeah.

-Ooh!
-PAUL: I got a pulse.

04:24.490 --> 04:27.248
Marjan, let me
get that tourniquet.

04:27.326 --> 04:28.750
MARJAN: Here you go.
How's he lookin'?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.010
PAUL:
His pulse is dropping.

04:30.162 --> 04:31.419
(screaming)

04:31.497 --> 04:33.588
Sir, sir, you know
where you are?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.499
Yeah. (panting)

04:35.592 --> 04:37.000
(groaning)

04:37.019 --> 04:39.695
(indistinct chatter)

04:41.115 --> 04:42.856
OWEN:
Okay. Where were we, Judd?

04:42.932 --> 04:44.190
Let's get Street Services--

04:44.267 --> 04:45.767
Oh, no! They forgot the foot.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.011
(all shouting)

04:48.104 --> 04:51.415
(theme music plays)

04:53.961 --> 04:55.018
(door opens)

04:55.020 --> 04:56.628
TK: Hey. Sorry I'm late.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.463
CARLOS: Hey. No worries.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.282
How was the meeting?

05:01.302 --> 05:04.970
A lot like last night
and the six before that.

05:05.121 --> 05:07.864
You have any idea
how proud of you I am?

05:07.883 --> 05:08.882
For going to a meeting?

05:08.958 --> 05:10.458
For going to
a few more than that.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.812
Ninety meetings in ninety days
is no joke, TK.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.296
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.734
I love going to them.
I just don't love why I have to.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.320
I know. Me too, babe.

05:21.471 --> 05:24.323
TK: Sadie stole
a year of sobriety from me.

05:24.399 --> 05:25.807
All the other times I relapsed

05:25.884 --> 05:27.141
was because of a choice
that I made.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.143
This time,
I didn't have the option.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.645
It was made for me.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.055
I was reading
this article online

05:32.148 --> 05:34.391
and it said that it's best
not to dwell on the people

05:34.393 --> 05:37.485
connected to the relapse,
no matter the circumstances.

05:37.563 --> 05:40.172
That's funny. Cooper said
the same thing tonight.

05:41.157 --> 05:43.083
-Cooper?
-Mm-hmm.

05:43.159 --> 05:45.235
His name's been
popping up a lot lately.

05:45.253 --> 05:47.995
Yeah, he's been coming
to a few of my meetings

05:48.015 --> 05:49.431
just to support me.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.852
You know, I'm down to join you

05:53.929 --> 05:56.563
if... if you want.

05:57.599 --> 05:58.765
Just say the word.

05:58.842 --> 06:00.192
I appreciate it.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.921
We have a few minutes
if you wanna change

06:04.923 --> 06:06.514
before I start
heating up dinner.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.427
(sighs) That looks really good
but, uh, I already ate.

06:10.429 --> 06:13.113
TK, you can't live
on AA donuts alone.

06:13.189 --> 06:14.614
No, I actually had an omelet
and hash browns.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.951
I went out to eat with Cooper
after the meeting to talk.

06:18.027 --> 06:19.044
There's that name again.

06:19.121 --> 06:20.212
Yeah. I, uh,

06:20.363 --> 06:22.381
I asked him
to be my sponsor tonight.

06:23.533 --> 06:26.701
Oh. I didn't know
you were in the market.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.170
Yeah, well,
I've kinda been putting off
getting a local sponsor

06:29.281 --> 06:30.555
since I moved from New York.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.207
But now that this happened,
it seemed like the right time.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.452
So what's he like, Cooper?

06:35.470 --> 06:38.880
He's been sober since he could
legally walk into a bar.

06:38.957 --> 06:42.067
But after all this time,
he's still laser-focused
on the program.

06:42.218 --> 06:43.551
That's great.
That's really great.

06:43.629 --> 06:46.129
You know, he made
a really good point tonight.

06:46.148 --> 06:47.555
Oh, yeah? What's that?

06:47.633 --> 06:50.967
I've had so much anxiety
about going back to day one

06:50.969 --> 06:53.227
more than I ever have before,

06:53.305 --> 06:55.414
and he said it's because
it's my first time

06:56.250 --> 06:58.291
going through without my mom.

07:07.577 --> 07:10.262
Can't imagine how hard
that must be for you.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.432
Yeah.

07:18.755 --> 07:19.729
What?

07:20.924 --> 07:22.515
You're just so sweet.

07:22.592 --> 07:26.002
Reading articles
with your adorable glasses,

07:26.021 --> 07:28.447
waiting for me to eat dinner.

07:30.175 --> 07:32.842
Just know that
I'm always here for you.

07:32.844 --> 07:34.286
I know I'm not in the program,

07:34.362 --> 07:37.605
but if there's ever anything you
need to get off your chest...

07:37.699 --> 07:41.376
I mean, there is something
that I wanna get off your chest.

07:42.204 --> 07:43.853
Please don't say my shirt.

07:43.855 --> 07:45.380
It's your shirt.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.041
For a girl who loved
to travel,

07:48.193 --> 07:49.784
Jen could get lost anywhere.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.452
I mean, it was her superpower.

07:51.472 --> 07:54.531
Is it just me
or is he super sexy tonight?

07:54.624 --> 07:56.457
Blanca,<i> cállate.</i>

07:56.551 --> 07:58.810
MORRIS: I remember
when I proposed.
We were in Venice.

07:58.962 --> 08:00.887
I had this church all set up.

08:00.964 --> 08:03.540
Three-string band,
a harp, violin,

08:03.558 --> 08:05.633
a gondola waiting outside,
the whole nine.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.321
All Jen has to do is to get
from the hotel to the church.

08:09.397 --> 08:13.408
I kid you not, it's 500 feet
from point A to point B.

08:14.143 --> 08:15.810
This is before we knew

08:15.887 --> 08:18.054
why it was
really getting harder.

08:18.056 --> 08:20.373
Before we knew about the tumor.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.168
Anyway, there I am,

08:23.245 --> 08:25.670
staring at the door on one knee.

08:27.824 --> 08:28.715
Nothing.

08:29.826 --> 08:31.676
Forty minutes I'm on that knee.

08:32.662 --> 08:33.737
Finally, the door opens,

08:33.905 --> 08:36.181
my heart leaps,
the violins start to play,

08:36.408 --> 08:40.260
and I propose to
Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield
from Wisconsin.

08:40.336 --> 08:42.646
-WOMAN: No!
-(laughter)

08:43.673 --> 08:45.248
Funny too.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.442
MORRIS:
I found Jen later
standing by a fountain,

08:48.177 --> 08:49.694
a little confused.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.573
Turned out that
was the perfect spot.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.410
I miss her every day.

08:58.764 --> 09:00.413
(indistinct conversations)

09:02.876 --> 09:04.434
-Blanca?
-Hmm?

09:04.452 --> 09:07.954
Don't you think you're
overdoing it a little bit?

09:08.031 --> 09:10.715
My husband is in a jar
next to my bed.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.292
Who am I watching my figure for?

09:12.444 --> 09:14.127
I am less worried
about your figure

09:14.279 --> 09:15.612
than hypoglycemic shock.

09:15.614 --> 09:16.888
<i> Ay, aguafiestas.</i>

09:17.040 --> 09:20.466
What were you two troublemakers
giggling about tonight?

09:20.619 --> 09:21.393
Well, uh, your share.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.879
It was very funny
and very sweet.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.806
Jen sounded like
a wonderful person.

09:26.958 --> 09:27.882
She was the best.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.067
Also, she thinks you're sexy.

09:29.218 --> 09:31.736
Oh, I do not. I... Um...

09:31.813 --> 09:32.812
Hmm. Wow.

09:32.964 --> 09:36.299
I mean, I don't not think that.

09:36.301 --> 09:38.276
MORRIS: Well, if it
makes you feel any better,

09:38.428 --> 09:41.246
I don't not feel the same way.

09:43.566 --> 09:44.624
You two be good.

09:46.010 --> 09:47.460
<i> Imposible!</i>

09:50.090 --> 09:51.497
-What the hell was that?
<i> -Ay, que?</i>

09:51.650 --> 09:54.593
I put you on the five-yard line.
You can't ask the man out?

09:54.669 --> 09:58.245
This is a grief group,
not a singles bar.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.156
You know he's not married.

10:00.249 --> 10:02.917
You're into him,
and he's clearly into you.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.843
TOMMY:
Morris and I are friends.

10:03.995 --> 10:05.678
Just strictly platonic,
that's it.

10:05.831 --> 10:07.163
-BLANCA: Mm-hmm.
-(door opens)

10:07.165 --> 10:08.756
Hey, Tommy. One more thing--

10:08.775 --> 10:10.683
-I'd love to.
-Oh, great.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.943
Uh-huh.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.929
-Dinner it is.
-It sounds lovely.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.931
-MORRIS: I'll see you then.
-Yeah.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.658
(Blanca chuckles)

10:19.769 --> 10:21.344
Oh, yeah.

10:21.363 --> 10:24.539
You're definitely
gonna tap that.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.129
(TK chuckles)

10:31.280 --> 10:33.706
TK: Oh, my God.
You're outta your mind.

10:33.783 --> 10:34.990
How can you possibly think

10:34.992 --> 10:37.302
Twenty One Pilots is
better than Macklemore?

10:39.030 --> 10:40.546
Yes, I've heard "Ride,"

10:40.623 --> 10:42.182
that's my point.

10:43.034 --> 10:44.959
Oh, my God. Alright.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.187
Go back and listen to
"Can't Hold Us"

10:47.296 --> 10:48.647
and then call me in the morning.

10:48.798 --> 10:49.981
(chuckles)

10:51.209 --> 10:52.651
Hey, Coop, um...

10:54.154 --> 10:57.063
I really appreciate
you taking the call.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.699
When you said 24/7,
you weren't kidding.

11:01.403 --> 11:04.663
I just...
I just really needed to talk.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.506
(smooching)

11:20.830 --> 11:22.906
What?

11:22.924 --> 11:25.241
I was just thinking
how nice it is.

11:25.260 --> 11:27.352
To have a few moments

11:27.429 --> 11:30.563
without being interrupted
by a kidnapper.

11:31.933 --> 11:34.192
Or a homicidal stalker.

11:34.269 --> 11:37.178
-Or a homicidal cop.
-Hmm.

11:37.197 --> 11:41.441
You know what?
I've cleared my schedule today.

11:41.517 --> 11:44.202
There are gonna be
a lot of moments like this.

11:44.353 --> 11:46.763
Hmm. I like the sound of that.

11:46.781 --> 11:48.289
(ringing)

11:49.100 --> 11:51.710
-Really?
-CATHERINE: Ugh.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.461
(ringing continues)

11:54.940 --> 11:56.464
Hello?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.108
You're kidding me.

11:59.127 --> 12:01.110
How many of them?

12:01.112 --> 12:03.463
Okay, I'm on it.

12:03.539 --> 12:04.280
What's going on?

12:04.299 --> 12:05.798
Some of the state senators

12:05.951 --> 12:07.467
announced they are
going to walk out

12:07.619 --> 12:10.377
to prevent a quorum approving
the governor's new budget.

12:10.455 --> 12:12.546
Well, at least they're not
homicidal state senators.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.749
No, not homicidal,

12:14.826 --> 12:16.276
though I might be.

12:17.295 --> 12:20.054
I'm sorry, Owen, I have to go.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.147
How long will you be gone?

12:21.224 --> 12:23.224
It could be a couple of hours.

12:23.301 --> 12:24.801
Could be a couple of days.

12:24.819 --> 12:26.995
Depends on what concessions--

12:27.822 --> 12:29.414
Oh, God. Horatio.

12:29.565 --> 12:30.974
Horatio?

12:30.992 --> 12:32.566
It's my turn to have custody.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.588
I was supposed to pick him up
from my ex's this afternoon.

12:36.739 --> 12:37.981
Didn't know you had a son

12:37.999 --> 12:40.149
or that you named him
after a seafarer.

12:40.168 --> 12:42.986
Horatio isn't my son.
He is my cat.

12:43.004 --> 12:45.004
Your cat?
You share custody of a cat?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.156
Patrick and I got him
when we were still married.

12:47.175 --> 12:49.583
And I didn't wanna
traumatize him when we split up.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.994
Oh, shoot.

12:51.012 --> 12:54.088
I think Patrick has
a business trip tomorrow too.

12:54.165 --> 12:55.607
Why don't I just
take care of him?

12:57.335 --> 12:58.835
-You would do that?
-I got nothing else to do.

12:58.853 --> 13:00.094
It'd be fun.

13:00.171 --> 13:01.571
Have your ex drop him off here.

13:02.431 --> 13:03.448
Huh.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.268
Oh, you're...
You're thinking about my bird.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.288
I am not thinking
about your bird.

13:10.439 --> 13:12.439
Yes, you're thinking 'cause
Ginsberg dropped dead here

13:12.459 --> 13:14.200
that maybe something
would happen to Horatio.

13:14.352 --> 13:20.023
I promise you, I will not harm
a fur on his furry little head.

13:20.041 --> 13:23.209
I know you won't,
because Horatio is hairless.

13:23.286 --> 13:25.361
-He's hairless?
-He's a sphynx.

13:25.363 --> 13:27.380
But I am not worried
about you and Horatio.

13:27.532 --> 13:29.841
I am worried about
you and Patrick.

13:29.993 --> 13:31.792
I won't harm him either.

13:31.870 --> 13:32.960
(Catherine scoffs)

13:32.979 --> 13:33.978
You think we won't get along?

13:34.130 --> 13:36.815
Oh, no. I think
you'll get along great.

13:37.042 --> 13:38.041
Maybe too great.

13:38.059 --> 13:40.151
I'm not sure I follow.

13:40.228 --> 13:43.154
Let's just say there are some...

13:43.231 --> 13:46.049
uncanny similarities
between you two.

13:46.051 --> 13:49.068
And I don't want you to think
I'm not over him or something.

13:49.145 --> 13:52.071
-Are you over him?
-Absolutely.

13:52.148 --> 13:53.556
Like you're gonna make fun of me

13:53.558 --> 13:57.126
because I
definitely have a type.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.246
Tss.

14:00.323 --> 14:04.158
You are so sweet
to watch Horatio.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.761
You sure it won't be weird
having my ex at your house?

14:07.830 --> 14:08.921
No.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.258
I'm looking forward
to meeting them both.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.853
Okay, sir,
don't pour water on it.
That'll just make it spread.

14:14.929 --> 14:17.246
MAN (over phone):
<i> How do I put it out?</i>
<i> The flames are getting bigger.</i>

14:17.265 --> 14:19.248
Don't panic. I need you
to turn off the burner

14:19.267 --> 14:21.359
and then grab
the biggest pot lid
you have, okay?

14:21.510 --> 14:23.510
But nothing glass.
It's gotta be metal.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.029
MAN:
<i> I got it. I got it.</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:28.199
Now, very carefully,
I want you to place
the lid on the pan.

14:28.351 --> 14:30.851
That should smother the fire.

14:30.929 --> 14:32.945
MAN:
<i> Okay, it's working.</i>
<i> Yeah, it worked.</i>

14:33.098 --> 14:34.947
<i> Fire's out.</i>
<i> Thank you so much.</i>

14:35.100 --> 14:35.948
You are very welcome.

14:36.101 --> 14:37.667
I'm sorry about your eggs, sir.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.212
(cell phone ringing)

14:42.865 --> 14:44.607
-Hey. What's up, T?
-TOMMY (over phone):
<i> Oh, Gracie, thank God.</i>

14:44.626 --> 14:47.126
<i> You know, I hate to bug you</i>
<i> when you're on shift,</i>

14:47.278 --> 14:49.220
but I-I have a little bit
of a situation here.

14:49.372 --> 14:51.464
Is everything okay?
What's going on?

14:51.616 --> 14:52.640
Um... (sighs)

14:53.801 --> 14:55.268
I have a date.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.136
You got a date?

14:57.288 --> 14:58.730
Uh. like a date-date?

14:58.881 --> 15:00.214
(sighs) Yeah.

15:00.291 --> 15:03.384
And-and I just really
need a friend right now.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.811
GRACE:
<i> Okay, listen, if you're</i>
<i> asking me to babysit,</i>

15:05.888 --> 15:07.405
then the answer
is absolutely yes.

15:07.482 --> 15:08.981
<i> I will get Judd</i>
<i> on Charlie duty,</i>

15:09.058 --> 15:10.316
<i> and I'm available</i>
<i> any day this week.</i>

15:10.393 --> 15:12.577
Oh, that-that's amazing.
Thank you.

15:12.728 --> 15:13.970
Thank you so much.

15:13.972 --> 15:15.729
<i> And I will take you</i>
<i> up on that.</i>

15:15.749 --> 15:17.415
But what I need right now,

15:17.566 --> 15:20.993
more than a babysitter,
is a fashion consultant.

15:21.146 --> 15:23.588
'Cause...

15:23.665 --> 15:26.816
Girl, I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to wear.

15:26.834 --> 15:27.833
GRACE:
<i> Don't say any more.</i>

15:27.986 --> 15:30.303
Okay? I got you.
Help is on the way.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.765
OWEN: I know I've hit you
with a lot of information,

15:33.841 --> 15:36.842
but I need some sense
that we're on the same page.

15:36.995 --> 15:39.178
We eat treats,
we do not eat cats.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.180
I'm not gonna lose
a burgeoning relationship

15:41.257 --> 15:43.349
because you succumbed
your baser instincts.

15:43.426 --> 15:45.092
-(whining)
-Oh, you can whine all you want.

15:45.170 --> 15:47.111
Hey, boy, at least
you don't have to move out

15:47.263 --> 15:48.838
for the next few days.

15:48.856 --> 15:49.855
Oh, you don't have to move out.

15:50.008 --> 15:51.432
Catherine says
Horatio is hairless.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.010
MATEO:
You can still be allergic
to a hairless cat.

15:54.012 --> 15:55.954
Hairless or not,
they still produce dander.

15:56.105 --> 15:59.015
Plus, they look creepy as hell
and I don't need the nightmares.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.458
-(doorbell dings)
-Oh, that's him.

16:00.535 --> 16:02.201
Hey, uh, listen, can you
stick around for a minute?

16:02.278 --> 16:03.986
I just want you
to have a look at this guy.

16:03.988 --> 16:05.463
Catherine's ex? Why?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.449
She says that
we are uncannily similar,
whatever that means,

16:08.526 --> 16:10.376
so just would like to have
an extra set of eyes.

16:10.528 --> 16:12.378
You mean you want me to tell you
how much more handsomer you are.

16:12.380 --> 16:15.289
-And every other way
that I'm better.
-(Mateo laughs)

16:15.366 --> 16:17.216
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I help you?

16:17.293 --> 16:19.385
I sure hope so.
You're Owen, right?

16:19.537 --> 16:22.146
-Yes. And you are?
-PATRICK: Patrick.

16:22.223 --> 16:24.148
Catherine said
you're gonna be taking care

16:24.225 --> 16:26.484
of our little monster
here today.

16:26.561 --> 16:27.801
This is Horatio.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.153
Hey, I'm Mateo.

16:29.305 --> 16:31.564
(sneezes) Told ya. Dander.

16:31.716 --> 16:32.824
(sniffles)

16:32.900 --> 16:34.308
Wha-- You're Patrick?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.476
All my life.

16:35.737 --> 16:38.979
Now, he has special pH water
for his urinary tract.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.072
Never use tap.

16:40.225 --> 16:41.666
And there's some fish oil

16:41.743 --> 16:42.816
which he likes on his dinner.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.076
Not to be confused
with the coconut oil

16:44.229 --> 16:45.336
which he likes on his skin.

16:45.563 --> 16:47.672
I take it this is your
first time with a sphynx?

16:47.749 --> 16:49.899
And already I know
I'm never gonna forget it.

16:49.917 --> 16:53.402
Now they get cold easy
so lay out a few blankets
for him to snuggle into,

16:53.404 --> 16:55.071
and crank up the heat,
it's chilly in here.

16:55.089 --> 16:56.848
It's 70 degrees.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.908
Yeah, well, you're not hairless.

16:58.926 --> 17:00.018
I'm fairly hairless.

17:00.094 --> 17:02.687
I'm... I'm so sorry.

17:02.764 --> 17:05.189
Oh, this? No, it's fine.
I'm not self-conscious.

17:05.266 --> 17:06.749
It started to go
when I was in high school.

17:06.768 --> 17:10.753
Catherine always says it's from
an excess of testosterone.

17:10.772 --> 17:12.421
Does she now?

17:12.423 --> 17:15.258
Okay, Horatio,
you be a good boy.

17:15.351 --> 17:16.425
-(meows)
-Thanks for doing this.

17:16.444 --> 17:19.111
I know this is
all a lot to take in.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.596
And yet I know that it's all

17:20.598 --> 17:23.416
I'll be thinking about
for the next two days.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.090
-That was horrifying.
-(Mateo laughs)

17:39.133 --> 17:41.225
Wow, you look nice.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.227
Wait, did we have plans tonight?

17:43.379 --> 17:45.379
No, I'm...
I'm going to a meeting.

17:45.456 --> 17:48.549
Oh. I thought you already
went to your meeting today.

17:48.626 --> 17:51.235
I did. I just kinda feel like
I need to go to another one.

17:51.963 --> 17:52.904
Something wrong?

17:52.906 --> 17:55.722
No, just restless, I guess.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.316
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.

17:57.468 --> 17:59.726
No, no.
I didn't wanna bug you.
You were doing your thing.

17:59.804 --> 18:01.895
Oh. You're not bugging me.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.564
You know
I'm a pretty good listener.

18:03.641 --> 18:05.658
I know, but when
you're in yoga clothes,

18:05.810 --> 18:06.918
I'm not a very good talker.

18:06.994 --> 18:08.753
Come on. I'm serious.
I want to help.

18:08.904 --> 18:10.404
What's making you restless?

18:10.481 --> 18:13.907
Sometimes I don't know until
I'm in the front of that room

18:14.001 --> 18:16.427
and then
the truth just comes out.

18:16.504 --> 18:18.763
So I called Cooper and he said
there's a meeting at the Y.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.098
-Oh. Of course.
-Yeah.

18:20.249 --> 18:22.825
I just think that's
a very nice sweater for the Y.

18:22.844 --> 18:25.186
-(knock on door)
-Oh, that's him.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.105
Cooper? He's here.

18:27.256 --> 18:29.107
Yeah. He thought it'd be
a good idea if we rode together.

18:29.258 --> 18:32.151
Would you mind getting that?
I'm gonna get my jacket.

18:37.859 --> 18:39.450
-Hey.
-Hi.

18:39.643 --> 18:40.535
I'm Cooper.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.028
You're Cooper?

18:43.105 --> 18:45.014
Yes. Yeah, I'm Cooper.

18:45.032 --> 18:47.516
I'm guessing you must be Carlos.

18:47.535 --> 18:49.502
Yes. I am.

18:50.037 --> 18:51.295
Please come in.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.189
Carlos, I've heard
so much about you.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.966
I feel like I already know you.

18:55.117 --> 18:57.117
Well, I hope I made
a good impression.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.711
COOPER:
No. You kidding?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.029
TK raves about you.

19:00.031 --> 19:02.122
Then we have
something in common.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.532
Um, if you guys have a second,

19:03.551 --> 19:06.035
I'd love to make you
a cup of coffee or tea.

19:06.037 --> 19:07.961
-Our meeting's at 5:00, babe.
-Of course.

19:08.039 --> 19:09.981
Thank you for dropping
everything last minute.

19:10.132 --> 19:12.224
Don't sweat it.
What are sponsors for?

19:12.301 --> 19:14.318
Besides dealing with
your basket case sponsees?

19:14.395 --> 19:17.380
Come on, man. We've talked
about that negative self-talk.

19:17.398 --> 19:19.048
You're right. I would say
I'm the worst...

19:19.066 --> 19:21.717
(in unison);
But we're working on that.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.828
Carlos, promise me that
you won't let him off the hook

19:23.979 --> 19:25.496
if he does that
when I'm not around.

19:25.573 --> 19:27.147
Don't worry.
I'll let him hear it.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.292
-Awesome.
It was nice meeting you.
-Yeah.

19:29.985 --> 19:31.252
Bye.

19:32.863 --> 19:34.338
You guys have fun.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.507
(door closes)

19:36.659 --> 19:38.301
But not too much fun.

19:41.997 --> 19:43.664
(knock on door, door opens)

19:43.741 --> 19:44.924
Hey, Judd.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.091
Thanks for coming by, man.

19:46.244 --> 19:49.078
Oh. Especially on baby duty.

19:49.096 --> 19:53.357
Oh, no problem at all.
Charlie loves her car rides.

19:53.434 --> 19:56.585
Whoo. Man, it's hot as August
in Galveston in here, Cap.

19:56.587 --> 19:59.012
What-what, you doin'
a sweat cleanse or something?

19:59.032 --> 20:00.698
Horatio likes it warm.

20:00.775 --> 20:01.991
Horatio?

20:02.760 --> 20:04.777
Behind you.

20:04.929 --> 20:06.662
-I'm cat-sitting for Catherine.
-(meows)

20:07.540 --> 20:09.098
Oh.

20:09.116 --> 20:11.242
Poor little guy.
He's-he's sick, huh?

20:11.394 --> 20:13.026
No, no.
He's supposed to look like that.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.195
-He's a sphynx.
-Uh...

20:15.215 --> 20:19.050
So Catherine shares custody
of Horatio with her ex, Patrick.

20:19.126 --> 20:21.868
And she told me that
I'm a dead ringer for him,

20:21.946 --> 20:24.463
so he came over
to drop the cat off.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.117
And in your opinion, he ain't
a spitting image of you.

20:28.119 --> 20:31.136
If I drank from
the wrong grail, maybe.

20:31.289 --> 20:33.714
Oh, so he's an older gentleman?

20:33.791 --> 20:35.124
Well, not old-old.

20:35.126 --> 20:36.976
And then Catherine's, like,

20:37.128 --> 20:39.237
is quite a bit younger
than you, right?

20:39.388 --> 20:41.130
I wouldn't say quite a bit.
More like a bit.

20:41.148 --> 20:43.132
But what does that
have to do with the fact

20:43.150 --> 20:44.891
that she's told me
that she has a type?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.151
Okay, so she has a type.

20:46.304 --> 20:47.745
Those-those
are the words she used?

20:47.822 --> 20:49.396
Yes. She-she said "type."

20:49.474 --> 20:51.490
Why? What does--
How does that matter?

20:51.492 --> 20:52.899
Yeah, I think I know
what's going on here.

20:52.994 --> 20:54.493
I think you're gettin' all
churned up over nothin', Cap.

20:54.645 --> 20:58.330
Really? Well-well, thank you.
But what is going on?

20:58.407 --> 21:01.000
Well, like my Uncle Cash
always says, uh,

21:01.152 --> 21:03.761
some women just prefer
the day-olds.

21:05.823 --> 21:08.915
The day-olds? What's that?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.751
Yeah, some women
prefer the company

21:10.828 --> 21:12.845
of an older gentleman

21:12.997 --> 21:16.089
because they are worldly
and they are wise.

21:16.167 --> 21:18.276
And maybe, uh...

21:18.427 --> 21:21.362
Maybe Catherine has got
a little daddy thing going.

21:23.858 --> 21:25.324
A daddy thing?

21:28.604 --> 21:30.955
I feel so dirty. Is it hot?
I'm... It's hot.

21:31.106 --> 21:32.272
I'm sweating.
It's hot in here, right?

21:32.366 --> 21:35.017
Yeah, it's like a sauna here,
but, Cap, Cap...

21:35.036 --> 21:37.186
It ain't dirty. Right?

21:37.204 --> 21:38.779
-You're two consenting adults.
-Right.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.357
Are you guys...
You guys are having
a good time together?

21:41.359 --> 21:44.802
-The best.
-She make you happy?

21:44.953 --> 21:46.712
I haven't been
this happy in-in...

21:46.864 --> 21:49.381
-Well, I don't know how long.
-Okay, so don't overthink it.

21:49.534 --> 21:51.867
Gal like Catherine
don't come around
but once in a blue moon.

21:51.886 --> 21:54.053
You're right? You know what?
You're absolutely right.

21:54.129 --> 21:55.146
Thank you. Thank you, Judd.

21:55.373 --> 21:57.130
I really just needed to hear

21:57.150 --> 21:58.482
your elegant hillbilly wisdom.

21:58.559 --> 22:01.210
Well, don't thank me,
thank my Uncle Cash.

22:01.212 --> 22:02.394
-(Charlie crying)
-What is it?

22:02.547 --> 22:05.564
Oh, come here.
Your daddy's got you now.

22:05.641 --> 22:06.715
Come here, sweetie.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.809
Come here, come here, come here.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.903
Come on. (laughs)

22:10.979 --> 22:12.145
You're okay.

22:12.223 --> 22:14.498
Daddy's here now. You're okay.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.543
Your daddy's got you.

22:19.154 --> 22:21.154
Tommy, would you
come out already?

22:21.174 --> 22:22.915
You got me
on pins and needles, girl.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.425
TOMMY:
Promise to be honest.

22:25.102 --> 22:26.251
Am I ever not?

22:26.404 --> 22:28.754
Okay, but don't be nice
just to be nice.

22:28.906 --> 22:30.831
Just... please be nice.

22:30.908 --> 22:32.558
Tommy, come out.

22:43.938 --> 22:45.363
Well? Feedback.

22:45.514 --> 22:49.533
I'm sorry. It's hard to talk
with my jaw on the floor.

22:49.610 --> 22:50.776
So you like it?

22:50.853 --> 22:53.537
I do. I really, really do.

22:55.116 --> 22:57.541
-Okay, what?
-Oh, nothing.

22:57.693 --> 22:59.359
No, no, no. Not nothing.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.213
You don't "I really do" me
unless you're hiding something.

23:02.364 --> 23:03.196
So you have thoughts.

23:03.274 --> 23:05.441
Well, I have a thought.

23:05.459 --> 23:07.960
You are buttoned up
a little high there.

23:08.036 --> 23:09.887
Now that, that usually
sends a certain message.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.037
Like I'm uptight?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.723
Like you want him
to call you ma'am.

23:12.875 --> 23:13.891
Oh. No.

23:13.968 --> 23:16.209
Okay. Alright.
How's that?

23:16.287 --> 23:19.230
See, now you're sending
a very different message.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.141
I... can't do this.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.627
No, no.
I'm calling Morris.

23:24.629 --> 23:25.978
To say what, Tommy?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.980
Evie's...
Evie's puking her guts out.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.798
That's right.
And I've gotta cancel.

23:29.817 --> 23:32.225
-GRACE: Mm-mmm.
-Yeah, but...

23:32.303 --> 23:34.161
You will do no such thing.

23:37.308 --> 23:39.250
I'm not ready, Grace.

23:39.401 --> 23:40.993
You're not ready for what,
Tommy, for dinner?

23:41.145 --> 23:43.087
Dinner with a bunch of subtext.

23:43.238 --> 23:45.923
Well, there doesn't have to be
a bunch of subtext.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.967
Especially if you go up
one more button.

23:49.837 --> 23:51.011
I...

23:53.081 --> 23:55.324
No, it's... No. No!

23:55.326 --> 23:57.726
It's too soon. It's wrong.

23:59.497 --> 24:02.014
Charles and I
were supposed to be forever.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.732
What the hell am I doing?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.153
Sit down.

24:11.692 --> 24:12.741
Look at me.

24:14.195 --> 24:16.512
You are living your life, Tommy.

24:16.514 --> 24:20.199
And that is what
Charles would have wanted.

24:20.275 --> 24:22.293
Listen, somebody else
in this world

24:22.444 --> 24:25.129
wants to sit down
and have a meal with you.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.216
Somebody that you
might like to get to know.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.376
It's not betrayal.

24:31.529 --> 24:34.472
It's not a commitment.
It's just dinner.

24:35.366 --> 24:36.882
What if I turn into a puddle

24:36.959 --> 24:38.550
before the appetizers
even arrive?

24:38.627 --> 24:39.685
I got you.

24:41.964 --> 24:42.963
(clears throat)

24:43.040 --> 24:44.873
These, friend, are for you.

24:44.875 --> 24:46.709
Oh.

24:46.711 --> 24:47.801
You came prepared.

24:47.878 --> 24:49.561
-Always.
-Mm-hmm.

24:49.638 --> 24:51.197
I can't stand you.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.659
You deserve
to have fun again, T.

24:57.980 --> 24:59.388
What if I don't remember how?

24:59.406 --> 25:03.167
Hmm, well, it usually helps
to start with a cocktail.

25:03.894 --> 25:05.077
-Or two?
-Mm-hmm.

25:05.229 --> 25:06.837
See? There you go.
It's coming back.

25:06.989 --> 25:08.506
(both laugh)

25:15.589 --> 25:16.680
Here we go.

25:16.832 --> 25:17.831
Thank you.

25:17.908 --> 25:18.974
MORRIS: Thank you.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.644
<i> -Salud.</i>
<i> -Salud.</i>

25:27.193 --> 25:28.609
MORRIS: How's your Negroni?

25:30.696 --> 25:33.013
-TOMMY: Hmm?
-Your drink.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.773
-Do you like it?
-Oh. Um...

25:34.867 --> 25:36.258
It's... it's nice.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.118
Yeah, it's, um, it's very nice.

25:39.430 --> 25:42.206
So what are you thinking
so hard about right now?

25:42.357 --> 25:45.417
I was thinking, that, um...

25:46.212 --> 25:48.194
my husband used to make them

25:48.272 --> 25:51.048
so much better
in his restaurant.

25:51.125 --> 25:55.219
He used to use dry vermouth
instead of sweet and...

25:57.723 --> 26:00.449
-Oh, my God.
-What?

26:00.451 --> 26:01.967
The bread hasn't even
gotten here yet

26:02.119 --> 26:04.303
and I've already brought up
my deceased spouse.

26:04.455 --> 26:06.897
It's no big deal.
Don't worry about it.

26:06.974 --> 26:08.473
Believe me, this is a process.

26:08.626 --> 26:11.643
We all get a little thrown off
when we start back out.

26:11.796 --> 26:13.279
It's part of the deal.

26:13.814 --> 26:15.406
You okay?

26:17.635 --> 26:18.659
I think I'm good.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.820
But it is better
with dry vermouth.

26:21.897 --> 26:23.155
-Okay.
-You'll-you'll see.

26:23.231 --> 26:24.306
After the next round.

26:24.325 --> 26:26.158
-Is that so?
-That is so.

26:26.234 --> 26:28.493
Well... in that case,

26:28.570 --> 26:31.313
-we gotta get
some grub in first.
-Yes.

26:31.315 --> 26:33.165
Any of the appetizers
jumping out at you?

26:33.241 --> 26:35.109
I'm always a sucker
for a Caprese salad.

26:35.185 --> 26:37.761
Sold. What else?

26:37.838 --> 26:40.080
Oh, they have burrata crostini.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.599
I love crostinis.

26:42.827 --> 26:43.726
Oh.

26:45.329 --> 26:46.995
You don't like crostinis?

26:46.997 --> 26:48.480
No, I...

26:49.775 --> 26:51.358
I love crostinis.

26:52.928 --> 26:55.654
Morris... are you alright?

26:56.949 --> 27:00.159
Crostinis were Jen's favorite.

27:03.364 --> 27:06.665
She would order them with pesto
instead of tomatoes because...

27:09.962 --> 27:11.203
(sniffles)

27:11.355 --> 27:13.422
...tomatoes gave her
heartburn.

27:13.799 --> 27:14.948
(weeps)

27:14.967 --> 27:16.592
God, I miss her.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.263
I miss her so much.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.869
Would you like a... a tissue?

27:26.887 --> 27:28.887
Here, here you go.
Have some tissues.

27:28.964 --> 27:30.555
Thank you.

27:30.632 --> 27:31.982
Oh no, no, no, no.

27:33.878 --> 27:35.653
(weeping)

27:41.494 --> 27:42.493
Hi, baby.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.162
How was the meeting?

27:45.239 --> 27:47.998
Oh, you know, the same.

27:51.078 --> 27:52.628
That smells amazing.

27:55.733 --> 27:56.757
It's just chicken.

28:10.414 --> 28:12.247
I'm sorry. Should I
have been cooking for two?

28:12.266 --> 28:13.932
I figured by the time
it was eight o'clock

28:14.009 --> 28:15.651
you and Coop
stopped for omelets.

28:16.845 --> 28:18.178
No.

28:18.255 --> 28:19.104
I can still make you something.

28:19.181 --> 28:21.198
-No, it's fine.
-Cool.

28:25.187 --> 28:26.662
(TK clears throat)

28:27.765 --> 28:29.873
TK: Is, uh...

28:30.025 --> 28:32.434
-Is something wrong?
-No.

28:32.453 --> 28:35.604
Really? Because you
called Cooper "Coop."

28:35.622 --> 28:37.047
And I don't even think I have.

28:37.199 --> 28:41.135
No? I thought maybe you did
on the phone the other night.

28:41.795 --> 28:44.204
3:00 in the morning.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.057
(sighs)
You're really mad at me
for calling my sponsor?

28:47.209 --> 28:50.285
No, of course not.

28:50.287 --> 28:52.253
Let's just forget about it.
It's not my place.

28:53.381 --> 28:56.049
Just trying to figure out
what my place is.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.976
I-I don't even know
what that means.

28:58.128 --> 28:59.461
It means if you needed
to talk to somebody

28:59.646 --> 29:01.463
at three o'clock in the morning,
you could have just rolled over.

29:01.482 --> 29:04.074
-I didn't wanna wake you.
-Why not?

29:04.151 --> 29:05.984
Because, Carlos,
you weren't the one

29:06.136 --> 29:07.619
that I needed to speak with.

29:08.063 --> 29:09.371
Exactly.

29:14.979 --> 29:15.994
You know he's straight, right?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.996
-Why does that matter?
-It doesn't matter.

29:18.148 --> 29:19.906
I don't think you're
cheating with the guy, TK.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.575
Not physically.

29:22.653 --> 29:27.431
Look, I know that confiding
to your sponsor isn't cheating.

29:27.582 --> 29:28.474
It just...

29:30.418 --> 29:33.086
It feels like he's getting
pieces of you that I don't.

29:33.163 --> 29:33.937
You don't want those pieces.

29:34.089 --> 29:35.831
I do. I want all of it.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.015
You have all of me, Carlos.

29:37.167 --> 29:38.692
-Do I?
-Yes!

29:42.006 --> 29:44.281
Would it make you
feel better if...

29:44.432 --> 29:46.341
the next time I felt the need
to use, I'd come to you?

29:46.360 --> 29:48.527
-You know you can.
-I know.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.162
And I might, but...

29:51.773 --> 29:53.415
it wouldn't be enough.

29:55.110 --> 29:56.518
-I'm not enough, you mean.
-No!

29:56.537 --> 29:58.020
Because you haven't
been there.

29:58.038 --> 30:00.022
And thank God you haven't.

30:00.024 --> 30:02.674
I need people in my life
that have.

30:04.878 --> 30:06.878
And if that...

30:07.031 --> 30:09.640
means that sometimes
I'm late getting home...

30:11.201 --> 30:15.604
just know it's only so
I will get home, Carlos.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.404
(inhales and exhales deeply)

30:34.575 --> 30:35.907
TOMMY: Hey.

30:35.984 --> 30:37.893
-(closes door)
-Tommy...

30:37.895 --> 30:41.246
-It's not even 9:30.
-Nope.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.249
Well, what happened?
I take it the date
didn't go well.

30:44.401 --> 30:46.418
There was a pile of tissues
on the table

30:46.494 --> 30:49.513
before the appetizers
even arrived.

30:50.257 --> 30:51.515
(sighs)

30:53.519 --> 30:55.077
Tommy, listen.

30:55.095 --> 30:56.411
I have been worried all night

30:56.413 --> 30:59.581
that I pushed you too hard
too soon.

30:59.583 --> 31:02.100
And I'm-I'm sorry.

31:02.252 --> 31:04.236
I never said
the tissues were mine.

31:05.847 --> 31:07.281
How about that?

31:08.033 --> 31:09.349
Wait. I'm sorry.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.110
Morris was the one
that fell apart?

31:12.262 --> 31:15.188
-Why do you look so surprised?
-Okay.

31:15.265 --> 31:16.856
It was a little
disappointing, though.

31:16.934 --> 31:18.858
I was looking forward
to the crostini.

31:18.860 --> 31:20.127
Drink?

31:20.546 --> 31:21.461
Please.

31:24.866 --> 31:27.134
Tommy, I'm... I'm proud of you.

31:27.945 --> 31:28.793
For being so brave.

31:28.946 --> 31:30.779
And... I'm sorry

31:30.797 --> 31:32.472
tonight was a disaster.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.950
I wouldn't say that.

31:34.968 --> 31:37.302
Not a disaster.

31:37.379 --> 31:42.290
I don't remember the last time
I put on perfume or heels.

31:42.292 --> 31:46.695
I had a craft cocktail
under the stars tonight.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.223
I have been living
with the buttons

31:50.242 --> 31:54.136
all the way up to my chin
since Charles died.

31:54.154 --> 31:56.079
And tonight,
for the first time...

31:57.157 --> 31:59.917
(sighs deeply)
...I felt alive again.

31:59.993 --> 32:03.754
Oh, gosh.
I'm so glad to hear it, Tommy.

32:03.905 --> 32:04.996
I mean, who knows, right?

32:05.090 --> 32:08.908
Maybe, maybe someday...
soonish,

32:08.986 --> 32:13.680
I might take this
whole little situation
down another two buttons.

32:14.958 --> 32:17.476
Miss Tommy Vega is back,
is she? (laughs)

32:20.088 --> 32:21.313
(sighs) Oh.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.692
God, I miss him so much.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.987
I know you do.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.778
Parker, will you please
slow down and talk to me?

32:45.798 --> 32:46.946
What's the point?

32:46.966 --> 32:48.190
The point is,
I'm trying to understand

32:48.208 --> 32:50.283
why you just broadsided me
in a courtroom.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.711
Pretty sure I made
that clear to the judge.

32:52.863 --> 32:53.971
Okay, but I don't understand.

32:54.122 --> 32:56.214
Every other weekend
at your dad's.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.957
We agreed,
that's been working.

32:58.035 --> 33:00.535
No, we didn't agree.
You just decided.

33:00.628 --> 33:02.721
Just like you've done
everything else in my life

33:02.815 --> 33:03.963
since I was a kid.

33:04.041 --> 33:04.889
(sighs)

33:05.042 --> 33:06.208
Look, Mom,

33:06.226 --> 33:08.560
I'm not choosing Dad over you.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.045
But, sweetie, legally,

33:10.047 --> 33:12.155
that's exactly
what you just did.

33:12.307 --> 33:14.049
Is that why he got you
that dirt bike?

33:14.067 --> 33:15.909
-Ohh.
-Because I told him.

33:17.571 --> 33:20.980
Damn it. I know I put
that parking ticket
in here somewhere.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.057
He didn't buy me off.

33:22.075 --> 33:23.241
Well, what did he do?

33:23.393 --> 33:25.243
Because he doesn't help you
with pre-calc

33:25.320 --> 33:26.819
or drive you to Mandarin lessons

33:26.897 --> 33:28.079
or, God forbid,
give you a curfew.

33:28.156 --> 33:30.340
Exactly.
He lets me have my own life.

33:30.492 --> 33:33.568
-He trusts me.
-Baby, I trust you.

33:33.570 --> 33:34.736
I'm not a baby.

33:34.738 --> 33:36.421
-I know. I know.
-Do you?

33:36.498 --> 33:38.256
You see me as like
this fragile little kid

33:38.408 --> 33:40.075
whose hand you need
to always hold

33:40.093 --> 33:42.835
when all you really
need to do is back off.

33:42.913 --> 33:44.271
Wow.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.274
I didn't know you felt that way.

33:58.945 --> 34:00.871
Mom, listen, I didn't mean that.

34:00.947 --> 34:02.947
Oh, you're right.
It's your life.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.458
It's your decision.

34:07.695 --> 34:09.546
These stupid things.

34:11.458 --> 34:15.868
Look, I'm sorry
if I disappointed you, okay?

34:15.962 --> 34:17.721
You could never disappoint me.

34:19.950 --> 34:21.266
(door thuds)

34:22.710 --> 34:23.727
(grunts)

34:29.976 --> 34:31.401
PARKER: Mom!

34:31.553 --> 34:33.361
Mom! Mom!

34:33.964 --> 34:35.155
Mom!

34:39.411 --> 34:41.495
-(siren wails)
-(indistinct radio chatter)

34:44.065 --> 34:46.750
I tried to pull her out,
but the door was jammed.

34:46.827 --> 34:48.085
I couldn't budge it, I couldn't.

34:48.161 --> 34:50.504
I know. You did
everything you could.

34:57.671 --> 34:59.078
Um...

34:59.098 --> 35:01.264
Let's get you back
in the ambulance.

35:01.341 --> 35:03.934
We'll finish
the bandage there, yeah?

35:04.085 --> 35:06.328
No. Yo. What... What...
Why are they stopping?

35:06.330 --> 35:07.420
Why weren't they helping her?

35:07.439 --> 35:09.331
What are y'all doing?
She's dying, man!

35:09.349 --> 35:10.999
-You gotta help her!
-TOMMY: Hey, hey.

35:11.001 --> 35:12.851
-Help her!
-I'm so sorry, honey.

35:12.927 --> 35:15.529
There wasn't anything
we could do to help your mom.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.365
Oh. Oh.

35:19.559 --> 35:20.933
No...

35:21.011 --> 35:22.768
What-what do you mean?
Is she...

35:22.846 --> 35:24.329
She's gone, baby.

35:25.773 --> 35:27.624
No, no. Mom!

35:27.701 --> 35:29.517
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Mom!

35:29.519 --> 35:30.610
Mom.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.670
Mom.

35:32.873 --> 35:35.039
This is my fault.

35:35.192 --> 35:36.358
-This is all my fault.
-TK: Hey.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.877
No, it's not.
It was an accident.

35:39.029 --> 35:41.954
No, I distracted her.

35:42.032 --> 35:43.531
I was such a jerk.

35:43.533 --> 35:45.383
The last thing I told her
was to back off.

35:45.535 --> 35:48.395
And-- And now
I'll never get her back.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.649
She thought I didn't love her,
but I do.

35:52.800 --> 35:53.875
I love her so much.

35:53.894 --> 35:55.059
Oh, of course you do, baby.

35:55.212 --> 35:57.237
Of course you do,
and she knew that.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.048
No. She thinks I hate her.

36:00.066 --> 36:03.243
No. No, she doesn't.

36:04.070 --> 36:05.720
How do you know?

36:05.722 --> 36:08.373
Because she's your mom.

36:10.744 --> 36:13.336
(Parker crying)

36:24.574 --> 36:26.016
Hey.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.684
Thought you had a meeting.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.519
I blew it off.

36:31.248 --> 36:33.607
-You blew it off?
-Mm-hm.

36:40.181 --> 36:42.657
Oh, wow, I don't think
I've seen these before.

36:43.818 --> 36:45.685
Yeah, they were still packed up.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.495
Took me a minute to find 'em.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.948
God.

36:50.100 --> 36:51.783
She was so beautiful.

36:51.859 --> 36:53.293
TK: Mm-hmm.

36:55.863 --> 36:58.606
CARLOS:
Look at you there. So adorable.

36:58.608 --> 36:59.774
How old were you?

36:59.867 --> 37:01.718
-Six.
-Hmm.

37:01.869 --> 37:04.888
It was the first time
she took me to dim sum
on Spring Street.

37:04.965 --> 37:06.181
Ah.

37:07.117 --> 37:09.226
God, we were so happy that day.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.211
(clicks tongue)

37:12.289 --> 37:14.731
I'd give anything
to feel like that again.

37:25.059 --> 37:26.618
We had a call today.

37:29.564 --> 37:33.291
This kid was maybe...
14 years old.

37:34.419 --> 37:38.463
His mom died...
right in front of him.

37:40.575 --> 37:41.633
It was horrible.

37:44.078 --> 37:45.553
God, I'm so sorry.

37:51.161 --> 37:53.228
It's all pretty horrible.

37:58.259 --> 38:00.652
-Will you do me a favor?
-Sure.

38:01.929 --> 38:03.280
Will you put
all these someplace?

38:03.431 --> 38:06.157
I don't... I don't even know
why I dug 'em up.

38:07.861 --> 38:09.619
I think I'm gonna go lay down.

38:10.697 --> 38:11.663
Okay.

38:14.534 --> 38:15.417
(TK sighs)

38:24.803 --> 38:26.136
(Horatio meows)

38:26.245 --> 38:27.787
You are such a good boy.

38:27.864 --> 38:28.880
And one thing we know

38:28.974 --> 38:31.808
is Catherine certainly
likes her wrinkles.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.551
-(door opens)
-CATHERINE: Hey.

38:33.628 --> 38:34.960
-I'm back.
-Hey.

38:35.038 --> 38:37.814
I got my quorum.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.058
Oh, good. He's still here.

38:40.134 --> 38:42.226
I was hoping
I would get to say goodbye

38:42.379 --> 38:43.987
before Patrick picked him up.

38:44.064 --> 38:45.229
Well, the good news for you is

38:45.306 --> 38:47.407
he's probably driving
in the slow lane.

38:48.401 --> 38:52.812
Oh, my God.
Are you oiling him?

38:52.889 --> 38:54.146
Yes. I read
that it's important

38:54.166 --> 38:58.818
for sphynxes to be hydrated
and I can relate.

38:58.879 --> 39:01.579
Okay, I have to take
a picture of this.

39:01.731 --> 39:06.158
This is literally the sexiest
I have ever seen you.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.344
-(meows)
-(Owen scoffs)

39:07.420 --> 39:08.845
The only thing
that's missing is

39:08.996 --> 39:10.680
a life alert and a walker.

39:10.832 --> 39:11.923
(Catherine laughs)

39:11.999 --> 39:13.074
Something funny?

39:13.093 --> 39:15.393
Yes, you are.

39:18.357 --> 39:21.766
Owen, what is
your deal right now?

39:21.918 --> 39:23.175
Uh, my deal is I'm onto you.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.937
I know what you meant
when you said you had a type.

39:26.089 --> 39:28.365
That I like a man
who takes charge?

39:28.516 --> 39:30.867
(scoffs)
That you like the day-olds.

39:31.094 --> 39:33.111
Day-olds? What...
What does that even mean?

39:33.263 --> 39:34.520
Please don't be coy with me.

39:34.598 --> 39:38.166
We both know that
you have daddy issues.

39:38.935 --> 39:39.951
And I'm daddy.

39:40.027 --> 39:42.027
Where in the world
is this coming from?

39:42.105 --> 39:43.605
You know, I thought
that we had something,

39:43.698 --> 39:47.867
not just
unworldly sexual chemistry,
but-but a connection,

39:47.944 --> 39:49.961
a deep connection based on

39:50.037 --> 39:53.131
respect and trust
and transparency.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.466
Okay, Owen, we do have
all of those things.

39:55.543 --> 39:57.543
-Why don't you just calm down?
-Why don't you stop?

39:57.621 --> 40:00.121
I'm not some state senator
that you can hoodwink

40:00.140 --> 40:01.898
into your deviant bidding.

40:01.975 --> 40:03.900
My deviant bidding?

40:04.051 --> 40:05.885
Okay. Yes, I may be
a little bit older,

40:05.904 --> 40:08.146
but at least I'm not
a manipulative schemer

40:08.298 --> 40:11.315
who's taking advantage
of her elders for her jollies.

40:11.468 --> 40:13.726
I can't be with somebody
who would do that.

40:13.803 --> 40:16.320
Owen, are you breaking up
with me right now?

40:16.397 --> 40:18.081
Why don't you just
get yourself someone

40:18.158 --> 40:20.825
who has an AARP card?

40:20.977 --> 40:22.310
-(doorbell dings)
-Ah!

40:22.328 --> 40:24.963
Whatever you're selling,
your timing is terrible.

40:27.150 --> 40:30.910
Uh, actually, I'm here
to pick up my cat, Horatio.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.913
-Uh, hi, Cath.
-Hey, Patrick. Come in.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.748
He's all packed up.

40:35.825 --> 40:37.082
Wait a minute,
you're Patrick?

40:37.160 --> 40:38.768
Uh, yeah, yeah.
You must be Owen.

40:38.845 --> 40:40.252
I've heard
some great things.

40:40.330 --> 40:42.772
Patrick as in her ex-husband?

40:42.849 --> 40:44.348
Uh, yeah, that's it, yeah, yeah.

40:44.501 --> 40:46.609
Hey, buddy.
You ready to go home?

40:46.761 --> 40:48.778
But who was the Patrick
that dropped off the cat?

40:48.930 --> 40:50.447
Oh, it's Patrick Sr.,
it's my father.

40:50.598 --> 40:52.782
Hopefully he didn't, uh,
didn't talk your ear off.

40:52.934 --> 40:54.192
No, he was very nice.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.028
You know, I gotta say,
I, uh, I love the space here.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.956
It's like Vervoordt meets
Austin Modern Farmhouse.

41:00.107 --> 41:01.365
That's exactly
what I was going for.

41:01.518 --> 41:02.942
PATRICK JR.: I mean,
call me old-fashioned,

41:02.961 --> 41:04.961
but I'm a sucker
for functional minimalism.

41:05.914 --> 41:07.005
Same.

41:08.358 --> 41:10.449
Um, well, thank you.
Thank you so much for, uh,

41:10.469 --> 41:12.117
taking care
of our little monster.

41:12.195 --> 41:14.620
And it was really nice
to meet you, Owen.

41:14.698 --> 41:15.880
Finally.

41:16.032 --> 41:17.623
OWEN:
If only I had met you earlier.

41:17.701 --> 41:18.683
(door opens)

41:19.552 --> 41:21.052
(door closes)

41:21.128 --> 41:24.889
Patrick seems nice...
and very handsome.

41:24.966 --> 41:28.226
I told you. I have a type.

41:28.302 --> 41:31.713
What if I told you
that everything I said earlier

41:31.731 --> 41:33.323
was a joke?

41:35.235 --> 41:38.286
I'd say it's time
you found a new girlfriend.

(door opens)

41:46.746 --> 41:47.754
CARLOS: TK?

41:54.571 --> 41:56.513
TK: I think I'm gonna
skip dinner tonight.

41:56.589 --> 41:58.014
I'm not really hungry.

41:58.165 --> 42:01.166
You always say that and then
you end up eating at 2:00 a.m.

42:01.261 --> 42:03.911
I just feel like being
alone tonight if that's okay.

42:03.913 --> 42:05.605
No, it's not okay. Get up.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.565
I mean it.

42:32.792 --> 42:33.941
How did you get his number?

42:33.960 --> 42:35.293
I'm not saying I did
a background check,

42:35.445 --> 42:37.111
but I did a background check.

42:37.113 --> 42:38.796
Pizza's in the oven.

42:38.798 --> 42:40.974
Set up a timer
so you don't forget.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.142
You're leaving?

42:44.253 --> 42:46.229
You guys have
a lot to talk about.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.808
I don't know what to say.

42:50.885 --> 42:51.809
Me neither.

42:51.961 --> 42:53.552
And that's why he's here.

42:53.572 --> 42:55.321
I'll see you in a bit.
