telling you what's going on
in my life, like that's me

17:37.423 --> 17:38.524
opening up to you.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.125
I don't do that
with a lot of people.

17:40.192 --> 17:43.796
And the reason I did that is
because I like you.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.565
What Tati did was
some super bull [bleep].

17:46.632 --> 17:49.601
She definitely violated
and disrespected me.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.737
But I like this girl,

17:51.804 --> 17:53.605
and the fact that she's
sitting here telling me

17:53.672 --> 17:56.508
how she feels, it's changing
my mind a little bit.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.921
- Donna!
- Hey!

18:08.987 --> 18:11.723
- I'm hoping everybody could
just put their bull [bleep]

18:11.790 --> 18:16.295
aside, because this weekend
is all about me.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.131
- Tati, you look-
You look decent.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.466
- Wow.
- Girl, watch out.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.668
Don't cross any lines.
- Real friends can cross lines,

18:22.734 --> 18:24.269
and they know their boundaries.
- Stop!

18:24.336 --> 18:25.737
I'm so lucky to have you.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.340
All my Black Ink family's here.
- Yeah.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.309
- And I invited Richard.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.910
- What?

18:31.977 --> 18:33.879
This [bleep] gonna turn into
a [bleep] royal rumble.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.948

We gotta be mad cute when we go.
We gotta show off for Bae.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.270
Which one you think?

19:05.277 --> 19:06.645

the other day.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.647
He disrespected both of us.

19:08.714 --> 19:09.815
I love Bae and all that.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.950
Send my best wishes,
my best blessings.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.152
But I don't wanna be
around that man.

19:14.219 --> 19:16.421
{\an8}Yo, Cease lost his mind
the other day.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.991
I wasn't gonna put my nose
into him and Donna's beef.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.026
But instead of respecting me
for that,

19:21.093 --> 19:22.461
he lost his [bleep].

19:22.528 --> 19:24.997
So, now I'm pissed off, and
I don't really wanna be

19:25.063 --> 19:27.165
around the man, even if it is
for Bae's wedding.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.834
- Young Bae is our family.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.070
So just be a bigger person,
put that [bleep] to the side--

19:32.137 --> 19:33.672
- Be a bigger person?
- Yeah.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.874
- [bleep] that, I'm not being
the bigger person.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.410
Cease was losing his [bleep]
mind.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.113
{\an8}- Look, I agree with Alex.
I don't especially

19:41.179 --> 19:43.515
{\an8}wanna be there
to see Cease or Tati ass.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.984
But at the same time,
Bae is one of my best friends.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.686
And I can't just not
be at her wedding.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.621
We have to go.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.658
- At this point, I just don't
wanna be around the [bleep].

19:52.724 --> 19:55.093
Like his energy is
all the way negative.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.029
And that [bleep] is gonna--
it's gonna blow mine.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.598
- Hopefully, Cease can be
grown enough to--

19:59.665 --> 20:01.567
- He can't even be grown enough
to apologize

20:01.633 --> 20:02.801
and admit his wrongs.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.703
- Well, then maybe he just
won't say nothing, Alex.

20:04.770 --> 20:05.737
- I don't know, man.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.472
Like I'm disappointed in Cease.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.541
I used to look at him
as more than a boss.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.244
But now, I just lost
mad respect for him.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.479
Like what kind of man
can't own up to his mistakes

20:14.546 --> 20:17.649
and apologize
for his lame-ass actions?

20:17.716 --> 20:20.886
- Come on, Alex, forget Cease.
Do it for Bae.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.120
- I really don't wanna
say yah.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.456
I really don't.
- Say yah.

20:24.523 --> 20:25.857
Say yah, please.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.228
Yes?
- Yes.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.863
You better give me good [bleep]
after this.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.198
- I'll give you a blumkin.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.167
- I don't know what
that is--

20:35.233 --> 20:37.903
- DONNA: On the toilet.
- I'll pass on that.

to show everybody
the life of luxury

21:18.276 --> 21:19.978
outside the Black Ink bubble.

21:20.045 --> 21:25.751
So, I planned a bougie itinerary
for Young Bae's wedding weekend.

21:25.817 --> 21:29.454
My first activity of the day
is equestrian.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.124
You know, riding on
the mother [bleep] horse.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.292
Bae and Kitty's the only ones
to sign up.

21:34.359 --> 21:37.796
But it's okay, because we're
gonna make the best of this

21:37.863 --> 21:39.564
bucolic ass [bleep].

21:39.631 --> 21:42.067
- [chicken clucking]
- CEASER: Oh look, guys.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.302
You're about to see
a cock fight. [laughs]

21:44.369 --> 21:46.204
You're chasing the mellow.
- Ahhh!

21:46.271 --> 21:47.339
- He don't want no smoke.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.241
Oh, he 'bout to jump
this [bleep].

21:49.307 --> 21:52.177
Oh, we in the middle
of some beef, we in

21:52.244 --> 21:54.046
middle of some chicken beef.
- [phone vibrating]

21:54.112 --> 21:55.447
{\an8}- Sky has been blowing up
our phones

21:55.514 --> 21:56.682
{\an8}for the past two hours,

21:56.748 --> 21:58.850
{\an8}because she's pissed that we
haven't RSVPed

21:58.917 --> 22:00.252
for her grand opening tonight.

22:00.318 --> 22:02.587
But I mean, we literally had
one day's notice

22:02.654 --> 22:05.424
for Bae's wedding
and Sky's grand opening.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.693
So we went with Bae's wedding,
because quite frankly,

22:07.759 --> 22:09.027
we heard about it first.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.296
- CEASER: Let me check out
this cock fight real quick.

22:13.331 --> 22:16.735
- Fifteen times, bitch.
- Oh my God.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.137
- She knew this was
my wedding weekend.

22:19.204 --> 22:21.073
I sent her an invite like
two days ago.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.075
- Oh, he cooing up
on him. [laughs]

22:23.141 --> 22:26.244
They cooing up.
- [phone vibrating]

22:26.311 --> 22:28.547
- Obviously, we're keeping
this a secret from Cease,

22:28.613 --> 22:30.148
because he throw
a little tantrum

22:30.215 --> 22:31.683
every time he hears Sky's name.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.319
And the last thing that we need
is for Cease to turn

22:34.386 --> 22:36.021
in to the father of bride-zilla,

22:36.088 --> 22:39.057
and throw our phones into
some horse [bleep] or something.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.426
- Yo, Cowboy Bob, where you at?

22:41.493 --> 22:44.396
Oh, there you go.
- KIT AND BAE: Hi!

22:44.463 --> 22:47.199
- I've ridden a horse before
back in Jamaica.

22:47.265 --> 22:48.767
It just came natural
to me.

22:48.834 --> 22:52.237
I guess I was born to be
a horse man. [laughs]

22:52.304 --> 22:55.173
- I'm a little scared.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.441

a traditional Korean wedding.

have went with something

26:47.739 --> 26:48.840
a little bit more flattering?

26:48.907 --> 26:50.675
Maybe a little bit more
form-fitting?

26:50.742 --> 26:53.478

Hanbok all the time.

But the only way I'm gonna keep
a smile on my face while

cross lines,

promoted, because God forbid.
