WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:07.339
Ah, I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

00:07.549 --> 00:10.092
It's so good for Monica.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.722
Time's up! My turn.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.351
- That was half an hour?
- It's your timer.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.563
- Okay.
- All right.

00:22.731 --> 00:27.234
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.320
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

00:32.240 --> 00:35.242
Aah! Aah! Aah.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.952
It's so good, isn't it?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.413
I don't know what I did to deserve it.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.125
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

00:43.418 --> 00:45.335
Goodbye, muscles!

01:35.970 --> 01:38.430
She gives the worst massages ever.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.976
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.855
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

01:47.941 --> 01:50.651
If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.654
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.032
I won't screw that up by telling the truth.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.702
Dude, look out!

02:00.954 --> 02:02.579
You almost crushed my hat.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.414
Sorry.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.376
And the bunny got away.

02:15.718 --> 02:19.138
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.181
Oh. Yeah.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.808
There's this play, right?

02:23.059 --> 02:27.020
I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.106
A clothes horse, so I figure...

02:29.357 --> 02:33.902
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.904
And you'll make them disappear?

02:37.157 --> 02:40.367
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.245
Done!

02:44.497 --> 02:48.750
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.419
- Thanks!
- Sure.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.171
Please, take those off!

02:55.633 --> 02:57.426
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

02:57.594 --> 03:01.680
Um, only okay. Because I just
got back from the hospital.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.724
Are you all right?

03:03.975 --> 03:06.935
I'm fine.
But, uh, my grandma sort of died.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.647
- Pheebs, sorry.
- It's okay.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.858
She had a really incredible life.

03:13.109 --> 03:16.153
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.408
Maybe she's with us right now.

03:21.618 --> 03:26.538
Right. She's on a new spiritual plane
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

03:26.789 --> 03:30.250
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

03:33.129 --> 03:35.672
Uh, Pheebs' grandmother just died.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.134
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.721
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

03:43.056 --> 03:45.807
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.770
Not the way they're doing it.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.358
What happened? How did she die?

03:54.609 --> 03:55.692
We were in the market...

03:55.944 --> 04:00.614
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.158
I'm so sorry.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.327
The last thing she said was:

04:05.578 --> 04:10.457
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

04:11.084 --> 04:12.167
You know what?

04:12.543 --> 04:15.003
We will meet at the checkout counter.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.597
Since you're returning all this stuff...

04:25.848 --> 04:27.933
...you'll have to wear underwear.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.895
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.649
It's missing something.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.069
Oh, I know. Um, okay.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.033
Really? A purse?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.161
It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.872
- It looks like a woman's purse.
- No.

04:51.582 --> 04:55.669
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.547
See, look. Men carrying the bag.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.134
See, look. Women carrying the bag.

05:09.517 --> 05:14.646
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.150
Exactly. Unisex!

05:18.401 --> 05:21.528
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.616
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.704
I ain't going to say no to that!

05:39.339 --> 05:40.964
- Who is it?
- It's Phoebe.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.632
Oh, great!

05:43.468 --> 05:45.302
Oh, you.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.304
Um, what's up?

05:48.181 --> 05:52.851
Um, well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

05:53.853 --> 05:55.395
Um, no, thanks.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.065
Um...

05:58.232 --> 06:03.153
- Well, um, Grandma died today.
- Wow!

06:03.863 --> 06:06.448
Didn't she die like five years ago?

06:06.741 --> 06:09.076
No, she just died today.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.788
Um, we're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.707
Okay, I know I went to that already.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.459
No, you didn't!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.252
Then who's been dead?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.670
Lots of people!

06:23.257 --> 06:25.300
Look, are you coming or not?

06:25.843 --> 06:27.010
Um, no.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.349
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.811
Plus I'm going to a concert.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.564
I'd invite you,
but, um, I only have two tickets left.

06:41.192 --> 06:45.570
- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

06:49.117 --> 06:50.158
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.210
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.423
What?
Are you referring to my man's bag?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.386
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.638
It's got compartments for all your stuff.

07:11.806 --> 07:15.016
- Your wallet, keys, address book...
- Your makeup.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.855
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.649
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.069
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.114
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

07:29.365 --> 07:32.617
- All right, then you owe me $350.
- Fine.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.163
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.123
Joey...

07:38.458 --> 07:43.587
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.465
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.301
Don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.887
You-and-I sexy?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.980
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.274
Here's your, um, 3-D glasses.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.613
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.576
Hi, sweetie.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.828
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.623
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.878
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

08:25.796 --> 08:27.005
I brought you flowers.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.757
Oh, thanks!

08:29.008 --> 08:31.927
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.224
Excuse me, is this the, uh, memorial?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.017
Welcome.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.894
Here's your 3-D glasses.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.770
All right.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.775
So how did you know Frances?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.611
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

08:49.904 --> 08:54.616
But, um, I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.992
What's your name?

08:56.244 --> 08:57.953
Frank Buffay.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.334
You know what? Strike that.
My name, uh, actually, is Joe.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.295
Um, uh, Joe, uh, Hill.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.966
- You're Frank Buf...
- Shh. No! Joe Hill.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.343
You just said...

09:13.594 --> 09:16.388
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.224
But...

09:20.434 --> 09:21.726
Oh, my God!

09:21.978 --> 09:23.103
What happened?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.688
That was my dad.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.482
- Oh, my God! What?
- Check it out!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.527
It's like it's coming right at me.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.288
- Did you catch him?
- What did he say?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.708
He said, um, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

09:46.002 --> 09:48.128
I couldn't give him my real name.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.462
Why not?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.172
You saw the way he ran.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.175
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.136
What did you say to him?

09:56.387 --> 10:00.599
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.685
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.604
Could everyone take their seats?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.481
I just can't think about that now.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.776
- I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
- Okay.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.278
Let's go say goodbye.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.960
I'm off to my audition. How do I look?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.922
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.758
And a date with a man.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.847
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.725
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

10:44.018 --> 10:48.146
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.524
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

10:52.276 --> 10:54.027
...comes with a bag!

10:55.905 --> 10:57.906
I've got to meet my dad.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.908
Will you tell him who you are?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.744
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.871
But aren't you pissed at him?

11:05.122 --> 11:07.082
This guy abandoned you.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.586
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

11:11.837 --> 11:16.549
I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!

11:16.801 --> 11:20.011
You and me, outside. Right now!"

11:21.097 --> 11:22.764
I kind of scared myself.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.059
Well, at least you scared someone.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.854
You'd think I'd be angry.

11:30.064 --> 11:34.192
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny little head off!

11:35.027 --> 11:37.320
Fortunately, I'm past it.

11:37.822 --> 11:41.491
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.868
Oh, get off! Ow!

11:44.036 --> 11:47.038
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.040
What are you talking about?

11:49.291 --> 11:52.085
As a masseuse and a human...

11:52.420 --> 11:55.755
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.508
I give good massages.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.805
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.227
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.356
He does not like it. He's in pain!

12:13.607 --> 12:16.317
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

12:16.736 --> 12:20.280
- What?
- I'm sorry but, ow!

12:24.827 --> 12:26.119
You've been lying to me?

12:26.495 --> 12:28.079
I can't believe that.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.331
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.835
But the minute we start
to lie to each other...

12:37.173 --> 12:38.214
And by "we"...

12:38.841 --> 12:40.550
...I mean society.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.847
Anytime you're ready.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.475
Ahem, well, you must be new here.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.019
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.521
Could you try it without the purse?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.192
Yeah, sure.

13:00.279 --> 13:04.783
Ahem, well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit...

13:05.326 --> 13:08.036
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.872
Well, first, it's not a purse.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.707
Okay...

13:12.875 --> 13:13.917
Anytime.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.628
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.797
It's a man's bag.

13:19.673 --> 13:22.258
Okay. And go.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.970
Let me show you the catalog.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.722
Look. See?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.683
Huh? It's the latest thing.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.812
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.396
Do you sell these?

13:38.025 --> 13:40.777
No, these babies sell themselves.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.696
Thank you. That was great.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.740
But I didn't read anything.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.117
I think we've seen enough.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.454
All right, I'll see you.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.498
We got it. We got it.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.253
- Is Rachel here?
- No.

13:58.671 --> 14:03.424
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.177
I really like them.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.930
Please stop.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.183
We're supposed to be honest.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.104
I wish you could tell me,
"I don't like your massages."

14:20.776 --> 14:23.319
I don't like your massages.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.866
See? It's no big deal.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.869
But now you're crying.

14:31.078 --> 14:35.248
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.586
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.797
You don't have
to be best at everything.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.676
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

14:48.429 --> 14:49.721
Okay...

14:49.972 --> 14:52.473
You give the worst massages
in the world.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.767
I'm crying here!

14:55.436 --> 14:56.686
Look, hear me out.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.231
You give the best bad massages.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.193
If anybody was looking
for the best bad massage...

15:04.445 --> 15:06.696
...and they thought, "Who's the best?"

15:06.906 --> 15:08.406
They'd have to go to you.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.369
Huh.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.790
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

15:18.000 --> 15:22.587
...for the best bad massage...
Who would get that?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.464
It would be you!

15:24.673 --> 15:27.842
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.429
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

15:33.641 --> 15:34.807
Absolutely.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.018
Okay...

15:38.145 --> 15:39.646
I suck!

15:46.570 --> 15:48.196
Thank you for meeting me.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.822
Thank you.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.950
Come sit.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.495
Sit.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.372
Sit!

15:58.832 --> 16:02.210
Um, alrighty.
Um, before we get started, I need you...

16:02.461 --> 16:06.631
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.841
Yes, I am. Mm-hm.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.513
- Okay.
- So, what did Frances leave me?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.557
- Huh?
- That's why you wanted me to come.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.101
Oh, yes.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.145
Yes, she did. She left you, um...

16:22.690 --> 16:24.524
...this lipstick.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.318
Oh. Huh.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.572
Oh, it's, ew, used.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.326
Uh, cool.

16:38.080 --> 16:43.167
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.589
So question one:

16:49.299 --> 16:53.136
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

16:53.387 --> 16:55.388
Yes, I was.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.933
Okay, um, question two:
Um, did that marriage end...

16:59.184 --> 17:00.768
...A, happily...

17:01.061 --> 17:03.312
...B, medium...

17:03.564 --> 17:06.733
...or, C, in the total abandonment...

17:06.983 --> 17:09.027
...of her and her two children?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.112
It really says that?

17:11.363 --> 17:12.446
Yeah, see?

17:14.491 --> 17:16.826
I guess then I would have to say C.

17:18.494 --> 17:20.121
Total abandonment.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.415
Reasons for abandonment:

17:23.584 --> 17:27.002
Um, A, top secret government work...

17:27.546 --> 17:28.713
...B, amnesia...

17:28.964 --> 17:32.258
...or, C, you're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

17:32.509 --> 17:34.886
...bad, bad man.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.889
I don't want the lipstick that much.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.935
Would you do me a favor?

17:43.187 --> 17:44.896
Would you give Lilly...

17:45.856 --> 17:47.774
...that, please?
- What?

17:47.983 --> 17:50.193
When you see Lilly, give her that note.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.862
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

17:53.363 --> 17:58.117
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.329
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

18:01.580 --> 18:04.165
But you came to see Lilly?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.250
Yeah. Why?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.170
Lilly's dead.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.839
She what?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.257
She's dead.

18:13.884 --> 18:14.967
Are you sure?

18:15.135 --> 18:18.262
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.517
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe...

18:22.810 --> 18:25.520
How? Oh, my God.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.355
How long ago?

18:27.689 --> 18:29.190
Seventeen years ago.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.942
Oh.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.945
What about the girls?

18:36.865 --> 18:40.701
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.413
And Phoebe...

18:46.166 --> 18:47.959
...is on this couch.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.387
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.474
Phoebe, I, um...

19:03.642 --> 19:05.143
Whoops.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.272
It's just, I don't know what to say.

19:10.649 --> 19:15.403
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.448
Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.537
Would it make you feel
better if I said...

19:24.788 --> 19:28.374
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.963
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.673
So you can just go.

19:37.509 --> 19:42.471
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.433
- That's your defense?
- Yes, it is.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.687
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

19:49.938 --> 19:54.483
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.569
You make up songs?

19:56.820 --> 19:59.906
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.950
Let's see, how did it go? Um...

20:04.369 --> 20:07.371
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

20:07.998 --> 20:10.791
Why won't you go to sleep?

20:11.376 --> 20:14.086
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

20:14.338 --> 20:16.464
You're keeping me up

20:35.525 --> 20:37.443
I'm not very good at this.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.031
Well, I am.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.704
Not yet. No.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.419
Hey.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.421
Hey! How'd the audition go?

20:57.839 --> 20:59.257
Estelle said I didn't get it.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.718
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.345
I thought so too...

21:04.596 --> 21:07.223
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.641
What kind of problem?

21:08.976 --> 21:11.560
To tell you the truth...

21:11.812 --> 21:14.021
...they had a problem with the bag!
- Oh, my God!

21:15.565 --> 21:18.109
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.820
It's time to give up the bag.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.614
I don't want to give up the bag.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.617
I don't have to give it up, do I, Rach?

21:30.038 --> 21:32.456
You think I should give up the bag!

21:32.749 --> 21:37.169
Joey, I'm sorry.
As terrific as I think you are with it...

21:39.339 --> 21:44.051
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.139
I can't believe this!

21:48.390 --> 21:51.559
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.981
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

21:57.774 --> 21:59.275
...controversial.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.987
Yeah, um, they're called wallets.
