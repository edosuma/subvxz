00:21.320 --> 00:22.959
Whoa!

00:29.600 --> 00:31.079
- Stand and deliver.
- Do as he says.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.479
I've heard of this brigand.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.079
He is known as the Knightmare.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.559
Faster than Sam Swift the Quick.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.919
Deadlier than Deadly Dupont...

00:37.000 --> 00:40.239
Dabbling lowpads, the pair of them!
With terrible pseudonyms to boot.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.799
Cash bags, jewels, the lot.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.079
I will not be robbed
by some lone ranting cavalier.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.279
Who says I am alone?

01:05.319 --> 01:07.399
Right.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.159
Warm...

01:13.800 --> 01:14.879
Warmer.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.519
We are cursed. The Knightmare
is in league with the devil.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.039
Aye, Satan's sidekick, me.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.319
Where's the rest?

01:24.400 --> 01:25.919
What else would you take from me, sir?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.719
You know what I want.
Hand over the amulet.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.839
Hello.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.439
Oh, sorry. Chill it.
Don't mind me, don't mind me.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.879
I'm only going to be a minute.
Don't worry. Oh, very warm.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.759
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just ignore me,

01:36.840 --> 01:38.519
I'm just passing through,
like fish in the night...

01:38.640 --> 01:39.639
This is a robbery!

01:39.720 --> 01:40.799
Not fish in the night.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.319
- No, it's something else.
- This is my robbery.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.639
No, ships in the night, yeah,
something like that.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.999
Step aside
or I shall blow your brains out.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.759
Sorry, were you talking to me there?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.479
Try again, I promise
I'll listen this time.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.599
You have interrupted my robbery, sir,
and you will step away,

01:54.680 --> 01:55.799
if you wish to take another breath.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.919
You're going to get us all killed
if you don't shut your mouth.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.799
Sorry, sorry, I really was planning
to listen that time.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.639
But, basically, uh, I didn't.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.199
Usually someone hits me at this point,

02:05.280 --> 02:07.279
but she's taking
the year sevens for tae kwon do.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.479
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:09.560 --> 02:11.359
Yes! Got You!

02:11.440 --> 02:12.439
Ha-ha!

02:13.080 --> 02:15.559
Oh, hang on. If I didn't know better,
I'd say this was a robbery.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.119
I am robbing these people,
you are getting out of my way.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.759
I just need one tiny little thing
from out of this box.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.119
- This is my robbery.
- Well, can't we share it?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.999
- Isn't that what robbery's all about?
- Hyaa!

02:25.720 --> 02:26.879
- Hyaa!
- Oh, no, no!

02:26.960 --> 02:28.159
No, no, no, no, no!

02:28.240 --> 02:29.479
You bungled my heist.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.799
No, you bungled mine, Zorro!

02:31.880 --> 02:32.879
Whey-faced fool!

02:32.960 --> 02:34.399
Yeah, well, why don't you
show your face?

02:34.480 --> 02:36.599
At least I show my face,
what's wrong with yours?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.599
Nothing, Doctor.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.959
- You?
- Yes.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.879
It is me.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.559
What took you so long, old man?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.879
- "Old man?"
- Seemed apt.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.239
Life expectancy is 35 these days.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.999
Well, for everyone else.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.479
- But didn't you know it was me?
- Of course.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.719
You don't forget the man
who saved your life.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.319
- It's good to see you.
- Yes, I didn't get that impression

03:52.400 --> 03:53.919
when you were threatening to kill me.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.159
The Knightmare
has a reputation to maintain.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.679
That's a very good voice.
How do you do that?

03:57.760 --> 03:58.759
Practise.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.039
Last time I saw you,
you were founding a leper colony.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.839
I was so proud of you.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.919
Proud of me? You weren't even there.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.519
Yes, I was.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.759
You didn't see me, but I saw you.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.239
And you just left me there?

04:11.320 --> 04:12.559
Well, you seemed fine.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.879
In a leper colony?

04:15.960 --> 04:16.959
No matter.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.999
You're here now. We should celebrate.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.159
Oh, no, this isn't a visit.
I've got a job to do.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.559
I'm here looking for an alien object,

04:24.920 --> 04:27.599
which has no business
being here on earth in 1651.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.399
It was just... It just so happened,
you know, that my tracking device,

04:30.520 --> 04:32.839
it led me to the carriage that you were,

04:32.920 --> 04:34.879
you know, robbing.
There wasn't, I didn't, it was...

04:34.960 --> 04:36.319
You mean...

04:37.040 --> 04:38.079
You haven't come for me?

04:38.160 --> 04:40.239
No, it was just a coincidence.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.639
Oh, Ashildr, I'm sorry.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.119
Who's Ashildr?

04:48.560 --> 04:49.679
You are. That's your name.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.119
Ashildr.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.679
Daughter of Einarr.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.199
Chuckles. I used to call him Chuckles.
Do you remember that?

04:56.640 --> 04:57.759
Yes.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.199
I think I remember the village.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.599
You loved that village.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.479
If you say so.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.879
Anyone in that village
would have died for you.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.119
Well, they're all dead now
and here I am.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.479
So, I guess it all worked out.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.559
- Ashildr...
- That's not my name.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.759
I don't even remember that name.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.039
Well,
what do you call yourself?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.839
- Me.
- Yes, you. There's nobody else here.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.039
No.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.599
I call myself "Me".

05:27.400 --> 05:29.519
All the other names I chose died
with whoever knew me.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.719
Me is who I am now.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.359
No one's mother, daughter, wife.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.399
My own companion.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.799
Singular. Unattached.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.839
Alone.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.239
Anyway, I should get started.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.399
Jump on, I'll give you a ride.
You can help me.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.799
With what?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.399
Packing.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.079
Come on.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.399
It's a big place for someone
who lives on their own.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.879
I have a servant.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.719
And all matters of visitors drop in.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.159
Your device,

06:24.440 --> 06:25.479
what is it?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.839
My curioscanner.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.759
Oh, it sort of, it scans for,
it scans for curios.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.239
I just realised how it got its name.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.359
It's been tracking exoplanetary energy
for the last couple of weeks.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.159
I've been following it
across the galaxy.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.599
And do you know what you're looking for?

06:40.520 --> 06:43.319
I've got a pretty good idea. Yes. Why?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.079
I wasn't just robbing Lucie Fanshawe
for her loot.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.959
She's bragged about having
the rarest gem in the land.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.319
An ancient amulet from foreign parts.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.919
Could it be we are
looking for the same prize?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.679
Clearly, you don't need money.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.079
So, why do you rob?

06:57.160 --> 06:58.719
For the adventure, Doctor.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.799
Isn't that what life's all about?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.919
I've had 800 years of adventure.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.759
Enough to fill a library
if you write it down.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.839
A medieval queen? How exciting.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.439
You'd think.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.479
It was paperwork and backgammon mainly,
as I recall.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.599
Ended up faking my own death.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.439
Did a bunk before the evisceration.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.639
Now this was much more my thing.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.239
The battle of Agincourt.
My first stint as a man.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.239
No one will ever know that a mere woman
helped end the Hundred Years' War.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.879
You're immortal,
not indestructible.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.159
You can be hurt.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.479
Killed even.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.879
Ten thousand hours is all it takes
to master any skill.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.719
Over 100,000 hours
and you're the best there's ever been.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.479
I don't need to be indestructible.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.919
I'm superb.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.839
You should have seen me.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.079
I could shoot six arrows a minute,
got so close to the enemy,

07:52.160 --> 07:53.399
I penetrated armour.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.479
How many people have you killed?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.199
You'll have to check my diaries.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.439
You can't remember.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.479
For what it's worth,
I've saved many lives, too.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.079
I cured an entire village
of scarlet fever once.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.879
Almost got drowned
as a witch for my troubles.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.239
Fortunately,
I'm really good at holding my breath.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.679
Ungrateful peasants.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.759
The Black Death.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.879
1348.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.159
- I meant to warn you.
- I got sick.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.319
But I got better.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.599
Of course.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.799
Your immune system is learning, too.

08:27.880 --> 08:28.999
There's another bout coming.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.759
And a big fire
that tears through London.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.919
Excellent.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.719
- Maybe I start it.
- No, that was the Terileptils.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.958
Surgeon, scientist,
inventor, composer...

08:39.039 --> 08:40.279
It's a fantastic cv.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.479
You should try my journals.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.279
I read them myself now and then.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.479
Drink pomace wine.
Have a little me time.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.239
You don't seem the nostalgic type.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.399
It's not nostalgia,

08:51.600 --> 08:52.759
it's curiosity.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.359
I can't remember most of it.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.999
That's the trouble
with an infinite life

08:57.080 --> 08:58.999
and a normal-sized memory.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.719
It can't have been easy.
Outliving the people you love.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.759
According to my journals, hell.

09:10.920 --> 09:11.999
Sorry.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.799
You'll have to remind me,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.679
what's sorrow like?

09:17.120 --> 09:19.159
It alljust runs out, Doctor.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.039
I'm just what's left.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.039
In fact, I've done all I can here.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.559
I look up to the sky and wonder
what it's like out there.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.759
Please, take me with you.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.599
All these people here,
they're like smoke,

09:35.680 --> 09:37.079
they blow away in a moment.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.039
- You don't know what it's like.
- I do know what it's like.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.119
Then, however you fly,

09:42.920 --> 09:45.079
whatever ship you sail in,
take me with you.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.439
How do you know I had a ship?

09:54.920 --> 09:57.719
Because I'm incredibly clever,
it doesn't matter.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.879
Take me with you.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.239
We'll talk about it.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.999
This thing you're looking for,
I'll help you find it, it'll be quicker.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.239
- I don't need your help.
- Yes, you do.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.959
I know where Lucie Fanshawe lives.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.519
And I'm an excellent housebreaker.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.039
We'll leave in an hour.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.839
Today is the day I should have died.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.399
Instead, I was reborn.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.199
By my hero, a man called the Doctor.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.319
My love is dying.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.959
It broke my heart
when the questions started

10:45.040 --> 10:46.519
and I knew I had to leave him.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.239
I return to find an old man
who smiles and thinks I am a dream.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.879
I am flesh and blood, my love,

10:54.360 --> 10:56.639
but all you see is a ghost.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.719
Tears.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.039
The plague.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.319
Mass graves.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.199
Sightless children...

11:17.280 --> 11:19.239
"...clutching toys
as they sleep,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.519
"never to wake up.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.799
"My children.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.439
"My screams.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.399
"I could not save you,

11:30.600 --> 11:31.719
"little ones.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.999
"Such pain.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.119
"And yet, still, still,

11:38.200 --> 11:40.279
"I am not brave enough to die.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.119
"To let go of this

11:44.080 --> 11:45.079
"wretched life.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.239
"I will endure,

11:50.640 --> 11:51.999
"but no more babies.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.919
"I cannot, will not suffer...

11:57.800 --> 11:59.719
"...such heartbreak again.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.919
"From now on,
it's me against the world."

12:09.320 --> 12:10.759
Quiet, my friend.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.799
We have a visitor.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.479
I didn't get it.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.319
But I will.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.919
If your promise stands,
I'll have it by dawn.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.119
My visitor can help me.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.919
Don't worry, he doesn't know about you.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.679
Only about the artefact.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.519
He has no idea what we intend
to do with it.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.679
I read your journals.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.159
Why are there pages missing?

12:46.120 --> 12:48.399
When things get really bad,
I tear the memories out.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.159
What can be worse
than losing your children?

12:54.520 --> 12:56.679
I keep that entry to remind me
not to have any more.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.999
I've left you alone too long.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.399
I had no idea how much you had suffered.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.519
But I remember the person
you used to be.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.959
She's still in there.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.319
- I can help you find her.
- Spare me your pity. I'm fine.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.239
I think this is just another mask
that you wear,

13:22.320 --> 13:23.359
to protect you from the pain.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.479
I think the alternative frightens you.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.159
That this is who I've become.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.279
This is no way to live your life.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.319
Desensitised to the world.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.639
So you intend to fix me?

13:36.600 --> 13:37.839
Make me feel again?

13:38.800 --> 13:39.839
Then run away?

13:40.920 --> 13:43.959
I don't need your help, Doctor.
You need mine.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.359
Just this once, you can't run off
like you usually do.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.879
How do you know?
How do you know what I usually do?

13:50.960 --> 13:53.639
We met once in a Viking village.
I didn't give you my life story.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.519
It's true, though, isn't it?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.559
You're the man who runs away.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.039
Oh, who told you that?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.839
Maybe I just worked it out.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.959
Come on.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.599
- Housebreaks can be tricky.
- Not for me.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.479
Sonic technology.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.279
Should be able to deactivate any alarms.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.959
What's an alarm?

14:39.640 --> 14:40.959
The most wanted in the land.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.719
Now is not the time to be showing off.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.639
Now seems like a very good time to me.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.999
You'll need a mask, sidekick.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.479
- Watch and learn.
- Brought my own, thanks.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.439
'Tis black as night.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.519
I have a tinderbox somewhere.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.399
Show-off.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.519
Know where you're going, do you?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.319
The servants' stairs.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.719
Follow me.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.079
Why are you still alone?

15:16.160 --> 15:17.919
What happened
to the second immortality charge

15:18.040 --> 15:19.439
- I gave you?
- Shh!

15:24.680 --> 15:25.919
No one's good enough.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.159
- Humans need...
- Hush!

15:34.520 --> 15:36.399
Humans need shared experiences...

15:36.480 --> 15:38.519
I'm regretting sharing this one.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.679
It isn't right for you
to be on your own.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.039
Goodnight, ma'am.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.279
I'll wager there's a dressing room.
Come on.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.519
Doctor!

16:19.600 --> 16:21.559
Doctor, turn that thing off!

16:44.040 --> 16:46.039
The Eyes of Hades.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.878
Let's just go around,
see if we can't get out the back.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.999
Okay.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.159
Lucie?

17:43.880 --> 17:52.239
Lucie?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.959
There is an intruder
on the premises!

18:10.160 --> 18:11.719
Bring me my blunderbuss!

18:11.800 --> 18:13.679
- What are you doing?
- It's kill or be killed.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.559
No! You can't.
We should hide.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.599
Guard the doors!

18:25.680 --> 18:27.239
Alert the militia!

18:27.320 --> 18:30.879
Your feet, you oaf.
Oh, I said you'd be a liability.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.999
Just let me shoot them
and be done with it.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.239
You're the liability.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.239
Never have this trouble with Clara.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.199
Oh, is she still with you is she?

18:41.840 --> 18:43.079
Oh, you remember Clara, do you?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.359
Of course.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.999
I take particular note
of anyone's weaknesses.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.439
Search every nook
and cranny!

18:49.640 --> 18:52.319
I warrant they will hang for this!

18:52.400 --> 18:54.559
- So what's wrong with Clara, then?
- There's nothing wrong with her.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.879
Why haven't you made her immortal?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.319
Well, look how you turned out.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.159
She'll die on you, you know.
She'll blow away like smoke.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.519
Save your breath.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.959
How old are you, Doctor?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.079
Older than you.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.679
How many have you lost?

19:06.760 --> 19:07.959
How many Claras?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.839
Robbery, burglary, that's capital.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.479
Meat and drink to the hangman, Ashildr.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.839
I'm not Ashildr.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.359
I'm Me.
And I fear no hangman in Christendom.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.719
Ah-ha!

19:35.920 --> 19:37.199
Sam Swift the Quick!

19:37.560 --> 19:39.119
I wouldn't be so bold, if I were you.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.239
Don't you know who I am?

19:40.320 --> 19:41.439
The Knightmare,

19:41.520 --> 19:42.719
which is why I'm not alone.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.279
'Tis hardly a fair fight.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.319
And it was fair when you stole my patch?

19:49.400 --> 19:50.919
Is that a fake nose, Sam?

19:51.640 --> 19:52.959
Should call you Sam Sniffed.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.999
What's wrong with it,
it's perfectly normal, isn't it?

19:55.080 --> 19:56.199
For an anteater, maybe.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.759
Ooh!

19:58.080 --> 20:01.239
Well, never knew
you were so puny, Knightmare.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.399
Or should I say, Slightmare.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.279
No, not the puns.
Line in the sand, no puns.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.479
It's what's in my brain
that counts, Bingo Boy.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.679
Well, no brain
outwits a bullet, Dandiprat.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.439
This is banter! I'm against banter!
I'm on record on the subject of banter.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.079
Lay down your arms,
hand over the loot or I'll shoot.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.919
We'd better had.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.879
He'll probably aim to miss
and hit one of us.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.239
We could give you cash instead.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.039
Who's this? Your sidekick?

20:25.760 --> 20:27.279
You got your dad as a sidekick?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.719
I'm not his dad, I'm the Doctor.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.119
Is that the best name
you could come up with?

20:30.200 --> 20:31.719
What, says "Sam Swift the Quick"?

20:32.560 --> 20:33.679
Trying a bit too hard, isn't it?

20:33.960 --> 20:35.079
Or are you a little bit slow?

20:36.200 --> 20:37.559
You what?

20:38.920 --> 20:41.559
I rest my case.
No one outwits the Knightmare.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.279
Whoa!

20:46.640 --> 20:49.599
If you value the life of your sidekick,
back off.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.719
Put the weapon down...

20:52.720 --> 20:54.199
Who's slow now, Doctor?

20:54.280 --> 20:55.639
Whoa!

20:56.560 --> 20:58.079
- Good question.
- Please.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.439
Knightmare, I don't want to die.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.279
Let's have honour amongst us.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.639
Also, can you confirm
that I'm not your dad?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.399
What do you say, Dad?

21:06.080 --> 21:07.519
I should kill him?

21:07.600 --> 21:10.079
He'll be dead in a minute,
what difference does it make?

21:10.160 --> 21:12.359
Kill him and you make an enemy of me.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.719
Run.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.559
I know their lives are short.
I understand.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.679
But those lives do matter.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.879
Shut up.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.759
You're not my dad.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.279
I have a theory about the amulet.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.959
Morning, sir. Forgive me,
but might I enquire into who you are?

22:00.640 --> 22:01.759
The Doctor.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.519
Clayton, sir.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.599
- Would you care for a cocktail, my lady?
- Oh, yes, please.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.799
Half-blind and deaf as a post.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.919
He's no use any more really but...

22:19.160 --> 22:20.279
You keep him on.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.439
See? You do have a heart.
You don't fool me.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.879
- How do I look?
- Pink.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.519
Are you coming down with something?

22:26.600 --> 22:30.239
Look, why would an alien artefact
resemble the Eyes of Hades,

22:30.440 --> 22:31.599
King of the Underworld?

22:32.760 --> 22:35.639
An ancient Greek talisman
which wards off evil

22:35.720 --> 22:38.999
and protects those in death
on their journey to an afterlife.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.279
You tell me.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.919
Could it be that the mythology
originated on another planet?

22:45.160 --> 22:47.399
You can't wait to get going
and find out, I'll wager.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.839
No. I think I want to stick around,

22:50.920 --> 22:52.399
keep an eye on you for a while.

22:52.760 --> 22:53.879
Get me back on track.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.039
Well, why not?

22:55.680 --> 22:56.879
Hey, we're a good team.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.399
Then take me with you.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.039
You don't want to be stuck
with an old fool like me,

23:03.120 --> 23:06.039
you have this whole wonderful planet
to play on...

23:06.120 --> 23:08.039
It takes a day to get to Kent.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.359
In the future, you'll fly.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.999
I want to fly right now.

23:12.800 --> 23:18.719
I have waited longer
than I should have ever lived.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.039
I have lost more
than I can even remember.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.479
Please, Doctor,

23:29.640 --> 23:31.119
just get me out of this.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.359
I want more than this.
I deserve more than this.

23:37.720 --> 23:43.679
Why not?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.879
Because it wouldn't be good.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.319
Ashildr, please.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.039
Ashildr...

24:00.120 --> 24:04.399
I am not Ashildr any more.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.039
Do you have a cat?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.719
Sounds like a very big cat.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.479
Hence, the very big cat flap.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.919
Leandro, meet the Doctor.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.999
You thought I was helping you.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.199
In fact, it was the other way around.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.679
Leandro, we have it.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.559
My friend here
was as useful as I'd hoped.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.479
If somebody needed my help,
why did nobody just ask?

24:43.880 --> 24:47.239
I am forced to assume that you have
plans that I wouldn't approve.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.199
- Oh, Ashildr.
- Stop calling me that.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.759
- Kill me.
- Why?

24:54.840 --> 24:56.919
If you intend any harm to this planet
or its people,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.679
then killing me is by far
your best move.

24:58.760 --> 24:59.959
You invite your own death?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.679
No, I just want you to attack first.
Then my conscience is clear.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.879
- Of what?
- You.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.159
You are not of this world
or part of my plans.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.119
I have no quarrel with you.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.039
Then tell me why you are here
and what you intend to do.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.439
Otherwise, get on
with trying to kill me,

25:15.520 --> 25:18.199
but I advise you,
be very quick and very sure.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.239
I am from Delta Leonis.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.919
My tribe was overthrown,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.919
my world destroyed,
my wife killed as we escaped.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.199
Using the amulet?
That was your means of travel.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.719
I lost it when I crashed to earth.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.319
I found him in my grounds.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.439
He's been sleeping there
while I searched for it.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.039
The underworld.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.479
Gateway to an afterlife.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.479
- Another reality.
- We need it to open a portal.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.879
- Travel the galaxy.
- Oh!

25:42.960 --> 25:44.799
Oh, so what's the plan, Ashildr?

25:44.880 --> 25:46.639
Fancy yourself as his new queen?

25:46.760 --> 25:48.639
Hunting, running errands
while he sleeps.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.759
Oh, dear God.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.399
You're just like every other man.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.839
I'm not looking for a husband, you oaf.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.879
I'm looking
for a horse to get me out of town.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.999
- You said no.
- What? Do you think you can trust him?

26:00.080 --> 26:01.799
He knows what it is to be alone.

26:01.880 --> 26:02.919
So do I.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.679
Then how could you do what you did?

26:04.960 --> 26:06.559
- I'm looking for the headline here.
- The what?

26:06.640 --> 26:07.919
Well, you know, you want to escape?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.199
Well, go on, escape as much as you like!

26:09.280 --> 26:10.799
Why would I not approve?

26:11.720 --> 26:13.119
- The amulet...
- What about it?

26:13.200 --> 26:14.479
A death is required.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.519
It is the only way the amulet works.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.639
Of course.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.239
Every single death is a tiny fracture
in reality.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.799
And the amulet
can lever the fracture open.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.359
Primitive, but effective.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.759
It's just exploiting
an abundant resource.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.319
- There's so much dying here.
- So who dies,

26:30.640 --> 26:32.279
so you can run away?

26:33.360 --> 26:34.759
Clayton?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.199
Coming, my lady.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.639
No, you can't, he loves you.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.119
To the end, it would seem.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.679
Would you rather take his place?

26:44.360 --> 26:46.079
Not the Doctor, we agreed.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.479
Ashildr, daughter of Einarr,

26:50.760 --> 26:52.119
what happened to you?

26:53.840 --> 26:54.919
You did, Doctor.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.119
You happened.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.559
I know you've suffered.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.119
Your children dying.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.799
They would have died anyway.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.199
Human life is fleeting.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.239
People are mayflies, breeding and dying,
repeating the same mistakes.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.799
It's boring.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.799
And I am stuck here.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.119
Abandoned.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.439
By the one man who should know
what eternity feels like.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.159
Who should understand.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.759
I do, now. But...

27:28.840 --> 27:30.399
You still won't take me with you.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.199
You gad about,

27:34.800 --> 27:39.039
while I trudge through the centuries,
day by day.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.279
Hour by hour.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.999
Do you ever think or care
what happens after you've flown away?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.439
I live in the world you leave behind.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.919
Because you abandoned me to it.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.759
Why should I be responsible for you?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.439
- You made me immortal!
- I saved your life.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.839
I didn't know your heart would rust
because I kept it beating.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.839
I didn't think that your conscience
would need renewing,

28:06.040 --> 28:08.479
or that the well of human kindness
would run dry.

28:10.560 --> 28:14.279
I just wanted
to save a terrified young woman's life.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.279
You didn't save my life, Doctor.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.599
You trapped me inside it.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.439
And now I found someone
who will set me free.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.799
Someone who understands.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.119
Look, I don't know what Lenny the Lion
is up to,

28:29.200 --> 28:30.439
but I know his type.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.159
Very first argument,
guaranteed he'll bite your head off.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.399
Or I'll bite his off.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.799
Perhaps I'll enjoy that.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.359
You're playing with fire.

28:38.440 --> 28:42.759
Open that portal, you have no idea
what horrors might come through.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.119
That's as good a reason as any to do it.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.479
You're not like this. I know you're not.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.679
This is exactly what I'm like.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.559
This is what you made of me.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.639
He'll kill you.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.159
He'll have to be fast.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.799
And if he does...

29:00.000 --> 29:01.119
Perhaps it's about time.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.319
Lady Me?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.519
Oh, Lady Me,
thank goodness you are safe.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.599
Sam Swift has been captured,

29:14.680 --> 29:17.359
and he swore the Knightmare
was heading in this direction.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.559
I've not seen him.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.879
Sam Swift will hang in Tyburn at noon.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.999
In half an hour?

29:24.520 --> 29:26.399
A guilty man, destined to die,

29:26.480 --> 29:27.559
no harm in that.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.719
I've not seen the Knightmare.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.999
But this is his sidekick, the Doctor.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.439
He was robbing me.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.279
I only just managed to overpower him.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.799
- You will hang for this.
- No.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.439
Listen, I was trying to help her.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.719
Silence or we'll...

29:43.640 --> 29:44.679
Shoot.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.239
He needn't hang. But keep him
under lock and key for all our sakes.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.239
Was that the door?

29:55.520 --> 29:58.199
Oh, dear. Always the quiet ones.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.679
Goodbye, Clayton.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.519
You see? I do have a heart.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.159
In which case, don't do it.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.919
Do I look like some feckless thief?

30:20.000 --> 30:20.999
I'm on your side,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.039
I'm an undercover constable
from Scotland Yard.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.759
Do you have Scotland Yard yet?

30:26.920 --> 30:28.719
Been on the cider, have we?

30:29.760 --> 30:31.159
The Dunbar victory medal.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.239
I was decorated for valour in battle.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.719
Tell it to the Newgate jailer.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.799
All I want is to bring
the Knightmare to justice.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.239
But you were robbing Lady Me.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.199
I came to warn her.
I fear her life is in danger.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.559
Look, it's the Knightmare.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.719
Cloaked and in disguise, bound
for Tyburn. You have to let me go.

30:47.800 --> 30:48.879
Or take me there.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.159
You wish to hang, too?

30:51.360 --> 30:52.879
Will you take me there if I say yes?

30:52.960 --> 30:56.079
Indeed. There's a bounty
on your head for £20.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.599
Twenty pounds? Is that all?

30:58.680 --> 31:00.559
'Tis a small fortune to us.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.439
Well, in that case, I know where
Lady Me keeps all of her money.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.919
Almost £30.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.479
Now, why didn't you
say that in the first place?

31:27.240 --> 31:28.479
Hang him!

31:30.960 --> 31:33.279
All right, calm down, steady on.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.119
Such a good turnout. I'm honoured.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.079
Oh, yeah.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.639
Hey, he's new at this,
someone had to show him the ropes.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.879
Don't worry, mate,
you'll get the hang of it.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.039
When I'm gone, they'll all say
that Sam Swift, he was well hung.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.079
Well, I think a few of you
know that already.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.559
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
I recognise a few of you lovely ladies.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.959
You, and you.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.839
I mean, I'd introduce you all,
but I can't remember your names.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.599
It's a good job you're here,
or they'd kill me.

32:34.480 --> 32:38.399
Mary, Meg, help me out here, miss.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.239
That's Mrs Baxter to you.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.399
That's a funny name for a fellow.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.839
It's time.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.559
I've got plenty more,
jokes that is, as well as women.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.199
Hang him now!

32:49.080 --> 32:50.839
Hang him! Hang him!

32:57.800 --> 32:59.359
Make us laugh, Sam.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.439
Aye, for while you laugh, I live.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.519
It was raining on the way over here.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.039
The hangman says to me,

33:09.120 --> 33:11.119
"It's all right for you,
I've got to walk back through this."

33:17.200 --> 33:18.759
What are you paying for, my beauty?

33:18.840 --> 33:22.679
To make it quick.
A fitting end for you, Sam Swift.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.959
Who should be the last
to kiss these lips?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.519
Me! Me!

33:27.600 --> 33:28.839
They must mean you, Lady Me.

33:35.640 --> 33:36.999
You remind me of someone.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.959
Now I want to live more than ever.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.999
Sorry, yes, yes,
sorry about the horse, excuse me.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.359
Sorry, excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.079
Time to hang!

33:50.800 --> 33:52.319
All right, all right.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.279
As God is my highwayman,
he steals the most precious gift of all.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.759
Life.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.959
Magical, filled with adventures.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.519
But at least I can say
that I lived mine to the full.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.559
I love you, Sam Swift!

34:10.800 --> 34:15.199
Is that the Doctor? Doctor, Doctor!
I'm a robber!

34:20.639 --> 34:22.119
Have you taken anything for it?

34:24.440 --> 34:26.039
Doctor, Doctor!

34:26.120 --> 34:28.719
Quick, I'm running out of patients.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.199
Have you ever seen a sidekick so old?

34:31.600 --> 34:32.839
I'm no one's sidekick!

34:32.920 --> 34:35.679
He's so old, he farts dust!

34:36.320 --> 34:38.839
His nose is so big that...

34:38.920 --> 34:40.599
They'll have to widen the noose.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.399
Or bury him in a pyramid.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.438
You know what they say? Big nose...

34:48.840 --> 34:50.679
Big handkerchief?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.719
No, Doctor, don't leave me hanging.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.879
I have a pardon here for Sam Swift,
from Cromwell himself.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.119
Sam Swift is pardoned.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.479
We didn't come
all this way not to see someone hang!

35:10.560 --> 35:11.799
What about the Doctor?

35:12.560 --> 35:14.959
Hang the Doctor! Hang the Doctor!

35:17.120 --> 35:18.279
Shh.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.999
You want to see someone die?

35:24.400 --> 35:25.679
How's this?

35:25.760 --> 35:27.639
No, Ashildr, no!

35:27.720 --> 35:28.879
No!

35:40.680 --> 35:42.479
Purple, colour of death.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.119
His life force is opening a portal.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.039
To my new life.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.159
Or to hell.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.359
A lion man!

35:57.560 --> 35:58.719
Look!

36:02.720 --> 36:03.759
Goodbye, Doctor.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.639
You are going nowhere.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.919
Doors work both ways.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.319
They let people out,
and they let the enemy in.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.839
What's that? What's happening?
What are those things?

36:12.920 --> 36:15.599
Spaceships, or they will be.
They're coming through the rift

36:15.680 --> 36:17.759
actualising in this plane of reality.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.559
You said you were
the last of the Leonians.

36:20.240 --> 36:23.719
- We were meant to escape!
- You shall, in death.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.559
No!

36:39.760 --> 36:42.759
Doctor, what have I done?
What have I done to these people?

36:45.120 --> 36:47.199
Stop this! They are defenceless.

36:48.920 --> 36:49.919
Ashildr!

36:52.280 --> 36:54.159
- He doesn't care.
- But I do.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.959
Oh, God, I do. I actually do, I care.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.679
It's awful, isn't it? It's infuriating.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.879
You think you don't care,
but then you fall off the wagon.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.919
Never mind about me,
what are we gonna do about them?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.759
We have to help them, they need you.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.879
They need us!

37:11.560 --> 37:14.279
- Welcome back.
- Well, do something then!

37:14.400 --> 37:18.439
Okay, okay, um, Eyes of Hades,

37:18.680 --> 37:22.079
afterlife, death opens up a gateway...
We need to close it.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.039
- Yeah, I know, but how?
- Sam Swift, he's the conduit.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.519
The amulet, it's still in him.

37:26.600 --> 37:30.039
It's his death that's opening the rift.
So, what do we do?

37:30.680 --> 37:33.119
- Reverse it.
- You cannot reverse death.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.759
Oh, yes, we can.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.599
Run!

37:44.760 --> 37:48.119
No, my lady,
they will destroy me for this.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.919
The light of immortality.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.879
Spare me, my brothers!

38:24.280 --> 38:25.279
Alive.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.199
I'm alive!

38:51.920 --> 38:54.119
Last thing I remember
is you turning up, Doctor.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.119
Good thing, too. Between you and me,
I was running out of material.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.999
I could tell, gave a whole
new meaning to dying on stage.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.919
Gallows humour can be tricky.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.879
But at least
there's never a second house.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.879
We've nearly finished these,
I'll get some more in.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.959
By the way,
I've not forgotten that kiss.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.919
- Is he immortal now?
- Do you want him to be?

39:20.520 --> 39:21.999
I don't think I want anyone to be.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.439
Well, probably not.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.879
Probably the power
would have been drained

39:25.960 --> 39:29.159
by the whole opening
and reversing the portal thingy.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.719
There'll be enough power
to bring him back,

39:31.800 --> 39:35.759
but not enough power
to keep him here. Probably.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.039
- Did you just make all of that up?
- Yeah.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.879
It's hard to keep track
of all this stuff.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.359
Keep an eye on him though,
he might be around for a while. Or not.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.559
Who can say?

39:53.120 --> 39:55.759
You're still not going
to take me with you, are you?

40:01.760 --> 40:04.239
People like us, we go on too long.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.519
We forget what matters.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.199
The last thing we need is each other.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.679
We need the mayflies.

40:20.040 --> 40:22.599
See, the mayflies,
they know more than we do.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.199
They know how beautiful and precious
life is because it's fleeting.

40:30.880 --> 40:34.759
Look how Sam Swift made every
last moment count, right to the gallows.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.279
Look how glad he is to be alive.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.119
I looked into your eyes
and I saw my worst fears.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.199
Weariness, emptiness.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.159
That's why you can't travel with me.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.759
Our perspectives are too vast,
too far away.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.919
You're not first, you know.
I did travel with another immortal once.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.399
Captain Jack Harkness.

41:10.240 --> 41:11.239
Who?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.319
He'll get 'round to you, eventually.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.079
Who told you about me?

41:20.520 --> 41:23.519
The man who comes for the battle
and runs away from the fallout.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.359
Take your pick.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.359
You've had an impact on this world.
You've made waves.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.999
Sometimes tidal waves.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.519
- I'm flattered.
- Well, you should be.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.359
You're an extraordinary woman, Ashildr,

41:42.040 --> 41:46.279
but I think I'm gonna
have to keep an eye on you.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.599
- No.
- No?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.999
Someone has to look out
for the people you abandon.

41:54.200 --> 41:57.919
Who better than me? I'll be the patron
saint of the Doctor's leftovers.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.719
While you're busy protecting this world,

42:01.680 --> 42:03.799
I'll get busy protecting it from you.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.759
So, are we enemies now?

42:09.200 --> 42:10.559
Of course not.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.119
Enemies are never a problem.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.479
It's your friends
you have to watch out for.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.679
And, my friend,

42:20.960 --> 42:22.599
I'll be watching out for you.

42:24.920 --> 42:25.919
Ashildr,

42:28.440 --> 42:30.479
I think I'm very glad I saved you.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.279
Oh, I think everyone will be.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.039
Hey! Hello?

42:53.320 --> 42:55.359
Oh, hello! Hi!

42:55.880 --> 42:58.719
- Did you miss me?
- Be more specific. Who are you?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.599
Ha-ha. I've got a present for you.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.479
- Why, am I ill? Are you ill?
- No. No.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.719
Are you never gonna travel
with me again because I said a thing?

43:04.800 --> 43:06.199
It's not a good present.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.279
Oh, well, that's a relief.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.719
Okay, Evie Hubbard.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.399
Year seven.
You helped her out with her homework?

43:10.480 --> 43:12.199
Imaginary interview
with Winston Churchill?

43:12.280 --> 43:13.919
- You basically cheated.
- That was her fault.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.639
Because she should
have stressed "imaginary".

43:15.760 --> 43:18.359
Anyway, she got an A and so,

43:18.680 --> 43:21.519
she has sent you a selfie.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.359
Yes, you're right,
that is not a good present.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.599
- Come on.
- Do they make sherbet lemons any more?

43:26.680 --> 43:28.479
And I'd like a Ferrari,
what about a Ferrari?

43:28.560 --> 43:29.639
I knew you'd be thrilled.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.319
Okay, come on, let me see,
let me see, let me see.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.599
What's wrong?

43:46.200 --> 43:48.639
Nothing. Nothing at all.

43:49.760 --> 43:52.639
- Doctor?
- Tell her, next time, I'll take cash.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.239
So...

43:56.920 --> 43:58.879
- Where are you gonna take me?
- Wherever you want.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.839
Hmm. Somewhere...

44:02.080 --> 44:03.079
Somewhere magical.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.279
Somewhere new.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.599
Ah, there is nowhere new under the sun.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.839
Above it, on the other hand,

44:16.360 --> 44:18.439
I've missed you, Clara Oswald.

44:20.520 --> 44:24.639
Well, don't worry, daft old man,
I'm not going anywhere.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.439
Twenty million Zygons have been
allowed to take human form,

44:39.520 --> 44:40.599
and are now living amongst us.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.639
Any living thing in this world,
including my family and friends,

44:43.720 --> 44:45.599
could turn into a Zygon and kill me.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.319
It's not paranoia when it's real.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.719
They've kidnapped Osgood

44:48.800 --> 44:51.239
and they've stolen the location
of every Zygon on earth.

44:51.320 --> 44:53.559
- Doctor, the ceasefire's broken down.
- Run away!

44:53.720 --> 44:55.319
We have a Zygon revolution on our hands.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.999
We've won the first battle.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.199
There will be truce.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.199
Andnow
we are going to begin the war.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.919
Or there will be consequences.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.559
- I think you might be right?
- About what?

45:06.080 --> 45:07.279
The end of the world.
