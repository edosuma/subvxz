WEBVTT

00:00.297 --> 00:01.379
Now, like all of you,

00:01.380 --> 00:03.995
I am awed by his artistic talent,

00:04.035 --> 00:05.622
but I promise you...

00:06.388 --> 00:09.893
the greater privilege is to
know Kyle West the person.

00:10.547 --> 00:12.879
If you witness his
energy doing charity work

00:12.880 --> 00:14.338
or sharing his experiences

00:14.339 --> 00:16.213
at the Institute of the Higher Mind,

00:16.213 --> 00:18.429
you see someone so positive

00:18.454 --> 00:20.357
and so truly committed to make

00:20.382 --> 00:22.796
the lives of people around him better.

00:22.797 --> 00:25.963
That's why I'm honored and
grateful to call him a colleague

00:26.181 --> 00:28.228
and most importantly...

00:29.038 --> 00:30.713
my friend.

00:30.714 --> 00:32.338
Kyle West, everybody.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.714 --> 00:46.421
Here we go, guys, J.
Law, Ariana's new beau,

00:46.422 --> 00:48.671
and Miley Cyrus has a
surprise up her sleeve.

00:48.672 --> 00:50.269
Ooh, I'm very intrigued.

00:50.294 --> 00:52.588
But first up tonight, we
have to talk about Kyle West,

00:52.589 --> 00:55.213
who just got his star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

00:55.214 --> 00:56.921
- Definitely a lucky guy.
- Yes.

00:56.922 --> 00:59.254
He also has his new movie, "AWOL,"

00:59.255 --> 01:02.396
and his reunion with
his ex, Lisbeth Graves.

01:02.421 --> 01:03.848
Is this going to be awkward?

01:03.873 --> 01:05.754
You could probably say
that, 'cause next week,

01:05.755 --> 01:08.134
they're both scheduled to be
at the Venice Film Festival

01:08.159 --> 01:09.687
premiering their new movies.

01:09.712 --> 01:12.186
Everybody's watching
because Kyle and Lisbeth

01:12.211 --> 01:13.442
haven't seen each other

01:13.467 --> 01:15.105
since she called off the wedding...

01:15.130 --> 01:16.616
- last summer.
- I need a tarte tartin

01:16.641 --> 01:18.170
and a ganache. Gracias.

01:18.195 --> 01:20.794
Why are you still here?
You're gonna be late.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.231
I'm about to run this guy's card.

01:22.232 --> 01:24.314
- I'll be fine.
- No, you're not gonna be fine.

01:24.315 --> 01:26.700
You're actually auditioning
for a Kyle West movie.

01:26.701 --> 01:27.892
I'll take your table.
You need to prepare.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.139
Because I'm really gonna get this part.

01:29.163 --> 01:30.353
I don't even know how
I got this audition.

01:30.377 --> 01:32.626
Megan, stop that. You're amazing.

01:32.984 --> 01:35.316
That guy in the suit
is really, really hot.

01:45.234 --> 01:46.896
Thank you guys so much,

01:46.921 --> 01:48.466
and, enjoy the rest of your day.

01:48.491 --> 01:49.746
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:49.771 --> 01:51.149
You're an actress, right?

01:51.150 --> 01:53.566
- I am, in fact, an actress.
- Really?

01:53.567 --> 01:55.864
Or are you just a waitress
who's trying to act?

01:55.889 --> 01:59.468
Sorry, my douche-bag
friend and I have a bet.

01:59.873 --> 02:01.066
I've seen you before.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.587
Yeah, you've seen her... here, idiot.

02:03.612 --> 02:05.152
Have you actually done anything?

02:05.177 --> 02:08.233
I was in a film that went
to Sundance a few years ago.

02:08.234 --> 02:09.691
Any TV?

02:09.734 --> 02:11.709
Please. I have 100 on this.

02:11.734 --> 02:14.066
"Seattle Med," "Blood Works,"

02:14.067 --> 02:15.941
and I'm doing "Paper
Tigers" later this week.

02:15.942 --> 02:18.024
See? I knew she looked familiar.

02:18.025 --> 02:19.789
- Pay me.
- I'm not giving you squat

02:19.814 --> 02:21.608
until she does a line
from one of the shows

02:21.609 --> 02:23.700
on her apparently extensive rÃ©sumÃ©.

02:23.725 --> 02:25.733
Honey, you should just walk away.

02:28.074 --> 02:29.154
Please?

02:29.179 --> 02:30.233
Please?

02:30.258 --> 02:32.066
All right...

02:33.859 --> 02:36.399
"That is a risk I'm
willing to take, Lieutenant,"

02:36.400 --> 02:38.211
"because last I checked,"

02:38.236 --> 02:41.316
"all citizens are
entitled to legal counsel,"

02:41.317 --> 02:42.649
"even vampires."

02:46.467 --> 02:48.875
That might be the
worst piece of dialogue

02:48.900 --> 02:50.455
I've ever heard.

02:50.650 --> 02:53.375
But I believe you're an actress.

02:54.312 --> 02:55.376
Enjoy it.

02:55.401 --> 02:57.178
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

02:57.737 --> 02:59.312
Bravo.

02:59.609 --> 03:01.108
Anytime.

03:01.109 --> 03:02.483
Nice work.

03:12.953 --> 03:14.151
Yeah, you know what?

03:14.176 --> 03:16.816
I don't think we're gonna
have time to get to you today.

03:16.817 --> 03:18.983
I know, but I'm only,
like, ten minutes late.

03:18.984 --> 03:21.446
And we have a hard out at 4:00.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.533
Have a seat.

03:34.275 --> 03:36.441
Hey, where do I know you from?

03:36.680 --> 03:38.191
Um...

03:39.000 --> 03:40.816
callbacks for that HBO pilot?

03:40.817 --> 03:42.274
Yes. We ran lines together.

03:42.275 --> 03:43.691
- Yeah.
- Yeah. How are you?

03:43.692 --> 03:45.483
I'm good. Good. How are you?

03:45.484 --> 03:48.006
I got the part.

03:49.109 --> 03:51.108
No way.

03:51.109 --> 03:53.524
HBO? That's... that's amazing.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.654
I know, I know.

03:54.679 --> 03:57.191
And I'm freaking out because
I just bought a house,

03:57.192 --> 03:59.789
and now I have to go to
Scotland for four months.

03:59.814 --> 04:01.522
And then this Kyle
West project comes up,

04:01.547 --> 04:03.566
and I'm just like, "Wow."

04:03.567 --> 04:05.399
Something is going on in the universe,

04:05.400 --> 04:06.899
and I should not be
questioning it right now.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.566
I just... I need to say yes.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.733
You know what I mean, though, right?

04:11.734 --> 04:12.975
Totally.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.566
Yeah.

04:14.847 --> 04:16.680
- Right?
- Yes.

04:16.753 --> 04:18.029
Yes.

04:56.783 --> 04:58.739
Where did you come from?

05:00.779 --> 05:02.233
Come on!

05:02.234 --> 05:05.274
Let's go. Come on, kids. Come on.

05:05.275 --> 05:07.399
Thanks so much for the opportunity.

05:08.597 --> 05:10.066
Let's go.

05:12.025 --> 05:14.858
Come on. Come on.

05:14.859 --> 05:16.608
I'm a huge fan of your work.

05:16.609 --> 05:19.025
No, I'm a huge fan of your work.

05:24.094 --> 05:26.135
Who was that man, and why is he here?

05:26.136 --> 05:28.191
Ivan and his green goats.

05:28.216 --> 05:29.987
You said you wanted
carbon-free landscaping,

05:30.012 --> 05:32.689
the goats are gonna clear
the hill and fertilize it.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.607
Is there any way of getting
Lisbeth's itinerary for Venice?

05:41.608 --> 05:43.320
There's always a way.

05:43.650 --> 05:45.440
Is that weird? I just...

05:45.441 --> 05:46.940
I don't want any surprises.

05:46.941 --> 05:49.072
Not weird. I'll take care of it.

05:53.233 --> 05:55.572
Come on. Let's go.

06:00.066 --> 06:02.107
Megan, you can go back now.

06:02.108 --> 06:03.446
Thank you.

06:15.134 --> 06:16.735
Megan Morrison.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.822
Last, but not least.

06:20.358 --> 06:22.108
Yeah, do you want...

06:24.358 --> 06:25.774
Okay, so you'll slate your name,

06:25.775 --> 06:27.190
I'll ask you the three imperatives,

06:27.191 --> 06:28.440
and we'll go right into the scene.

06:28.441 --> 06:31.166
- The three what?
- Imperatives.

06:31.401 --> 06:33.524
I ask you three simple questions.

06:33.525 --> 06:37.190
You respond with the first
thing that pops into your mind.

06:37.412 --> 06:40.107
The answers reveal your true character.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.524
But I'm an actress, I
have no true character.

06:44.858 --> 06:47.090
I don't actually mean that.

06:53.816 --> 06:55.713
You will respond,

06:55.738 --> 06:57.187
and the Agency will be waiting.

06:57.212 --> 06:59.109
It is fool-proof.

06:59.858 --> 07:01.958
I'm underwhelmed.

07:02.323 --> 07:03.982
Well, it wasn't a great read, but...

07:03.983 --> 07:05.649
I've always liked the
way she carries herself.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.197
She's got real confidence.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.661
Megan Morrison.

07:11.757 --> 07:13.257
I don't know who this is.

07:13.614 --> 07:14.815
She hasn't broken out yet,

07:14.816 --> 07:16.399
but I met her at an NRDC function,

07:16.400 --> 07:18.689
and she's very smart... East Coast.

07:18.714 --> 07:21.643
Right, 'cause everyone
from the East Coast is smart.

07:22.301 --> 07:24.232
If you could have anybody else's life,

07:24.233 --> 07:26.232
whose would it be?

07:26.357 --> 07:28.342
Amelia Earhart.

07:29.381 --> 07:31.899
What's the most dangerous
thing you've ever done?

07:31.900 --> 07:34.969
I hitchhiked from
Hoboken to Virginia Beach.

07:35.524 --> 07:37.274
What's your greatest fear?

07:37.770 --> 07:39.806
Maximum security prison.

07:40.623 --> 07:42.277
Yeesh.

07:42.342 --> 07:43.440
Don't do that.

07:43.441 --> 07:45.368
She's calculated. It's not authentic.

07:45.393 --> 07:47.690
- I can't help what I see.
- She's an actress, sweetheart.

07:47.691 --> 07:50.048
- What you're seeing is nuance.
- Right.

07:50.073 --> 07:51.420
Well, you are the producer.

07:51.445 --> 07:53.965
I'm just the guy looking out for
the Institute and Kyle's needs.

07:54.190 --> 07:55.565
Who's this?

07:55.566 --> 07:57.524
Someone I think you should pass on.

07:57.525 --> 08:00.614
Terence doesn't like how she
answered the three imperatives.

08:00.639 --> 08:02.607
Well, we do use them for a reason.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.923
- How was the read?
- We haven't watched it yet.

08:04.948 --> 08:07.201
Dude, you haven't seen her do the scene?

08:07.226 --> 08:09.184
This isn't about talent.

08:09.185 --> 08:10.850
Little talent wouldn't hurt, though.

08:10.851 --> 08:12.528
Let's roll the tape.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.703
Whenever you're ready.

08:16.728 --> 08:18.243
Okay.

08:21.685 --> 08:24.267
What makes you think you can stop it?

08:24.751 --> 08:27.751
Even if you make it
there, you won't survive.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.183
What do you think Sophia's answers were?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.427
Better than mine.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.428
She definitely wasn't
fawning over me after I left.

08:40.452 --> 08:42.610
Asking personal questions at an audition

08:42.635 --> 08:44.634
seems rampantly unprofessional.

08:44.659 --> 08:45.892
I guess no one's ever asked you

08:45.893 --> 08:47.767
to take your top off in a deposition.

08:47.768 --> 08:50.100
Nobody asks me anything in a deposition

08:50.101 --> 08:51.600
because it's a deposition.

08:51.601 --> 08:53.555
The whole world wants
to work with Kyle West.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.262
- He can do whatever he wants.
- It's just surprising.

08:55.286 --> 08:56.872
I've always had this image of him

08:56.897 --> 08:59.200
as being this grounded, evolved guy.

08:59.225 --> 09:00.264
Kyle West?

09:00.289 --> 09:02.309
Yeah, he does really interesting movies,

09:02.310 --> 09:04.475
and he's into the
whole self-actualizing.

09:04.476 --> 09:06.434
Institute of the Higher Mind stuff.

09:06.435 --> 09:08.975
That's what makes him cult-y and weird.

09:08.976 --> 09:10.767
And look what happened with Lisbeth.

09:10.768 --> 09:12.563
Yeah, but she left him at the altar.

09:12.588 --> 09:13.975
I think that makes her the freak.

09:13.976 --> 09:16.595
Or the one that came to her senses.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.844
The 10's a parking lot,
but we'll hop on the 60

09:21.869 --> 09:24.077
and be in the desert by sunset. Cool?

09:24.102 --> 09:25.809
It is your chariot, sexy man.

09:25.810 --> 09:27.574
Take me away.

09:27.599 --> 09:29.767
Snacks, charger, birth control.

09:29.768 --> 09:31.975
Snacks, charger, birth control.

09:31.976 --> 09:34.144
Backgammon.

09:38.217 --> 09:39.850
Please get back.

09:39.851 --> 09:41.698
No, I can't talk to you right now.

09:41.975 --> 09:43.516
Can you please just get in your truck?

09:43.541 --> 09:44.817
- Nic?
- I can't talk to you.

09:44.842 --> 09:46.263
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

09:46.287 --> 09:47.498
Nothing's going on, okay?

09:47.523 --> 09:49.789
- Please just get in your truck and go.
- You're Megan.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.654
Holy Christ.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.150
Who are you?

09:53.175 --> 09:54.769
- I'm Annika.
- Don't worry about it.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.579
She just hangs out with
the band sometimes, okay?

09:56.603 --> 09:57.841
She's got some serious problems.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.451
Yeah, starting with the
fact that I'm pregnant.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.350
- What?
- And I am so in love

10:02.375 --> 10:03.886
with the father...

10:03.911 --> 10:05.677
so in love.

10:05.702 --> 10:08.142
- You slept with her?
- No, no. She's making this up.

10:08.143 --> 10:10.517
No, I'm not. And you said
that we would be together.

10:10.542 --> 10:11.911
No, I said it was over!

10:11.936 --> 10:13.593
Don't yell at me!

10:14.809 --> 10:16.084
Megan, Megan...

10:16.109 --> 10:17.338
My God.

10:17.363 --> 10:19.775
Megan, what are you
doing? Megan, come here.

11:02.497 --> 11:03.941
And if I'm really being honest,

11:03.966 --> 11:06.215
I'm not completely surprised.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.239
You know, Nic and I
have had some issues.

11:08.338 --> 11:11.295
Every relationship has issues.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.004
It doesn't make it
okay to stick your dick

11:13.005 --> 11:14.670
in some love-addicted groupie.

11:14.671 --> 11:16.087
I didn't say that it was okay.

11:16.088 --> 11:18.510
I just said I'm not surprised...

11:18.955 --> 11:21.452
considering our issues are...

11:21.477 --> 11:23.313
of the sexual variety.

11:23.338 --> 11:25.438
He insists on anal, right?

11:25.463 --> 11:27.063
- I wish.
- What?

11:27.088 --> 11:29.633
I mean, it's... it's not
about him, you know? It's...

11:29.658 --> 11:32.634
I haven't felt sexy in a while.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.504
I don't... I don't really
know what my problem is.

11:34.505 --> 11:35.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:35.725 --> 11:37.933
Yeah, this is totally about him,

11:37.958 --> 11:39.901
and his dirty penis...

11:39.926 --> 11:42.800
that you somehow subconsciously
knew about this whole time,

11:42.825 --> 11:45.241
and that's the only reason why
you haven't been feeling sexy.

11:49.171 --> 11:51.240
Holy shit. It's probably Nic.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.986
It's not Nic.

12:00.374 --> 12:02.629
- Kevin! Hey, come in!
- What up, baby girl?

12:02.630 --> 12:04.321
Good to see you.

12:04.346 --> 12:06.462
Hi, hello. Hi.

12:06.463 --> 12:08.795
This is, Ryan and Kale.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.212
- This is Megan and Shaun.
- Hi.

12:11.213 --> 12:13.724
- Hope, are you kidding me right now?
- And this is whiskey.

12:13.749 --> 12:16.004
You guys brought
whiskey. You're so cute.

12:16.005 --> 12:17.879
Thank you so much.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.295
Why don't you come in
here, check out the pool?

12:20.296 --> 12:21.837
And, we'll be out there in a minute.

12:21.838 --> 12:23.844
- What else do you have there?
- Hi.

12:23.869 --> 12:26.254
- Okay.
- Okay, yes. I did that.

12:26.255 --> 12:28.106
I invited them over,

12:28.131 --> 12:29.420
but I did it for Megan.

12:29.421 --> 12:31.087
Well, you shouldn't have.

12:31.088 --> 12:32.754
Seriously, I'm just gonna...
I just want to go home.

12:32.755 --> 12:34.043
No, no, no. No, you're not.

12:34.068 --> 12:36.420
- Hope, in what universe...
- In the universe of Hope...

12:36.421 --> 12:38.099
where we do not feel
sorry for ourselves,

12:38.124 --> 12:40.420
and instead, we get our revenge.

12:40.421 --> 12:42.087
Gav is really fun, guys.

12:42.088 --> 12:43.549
I mean,

12:44.003 --> 12:46.254
his other friends are...

12:46.684 --> 12:48.596
Good God.

12:49.414 --> 12:51.486
Yeah.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.795
Whoo!

14:09.961 --> 14:11.942
Nic.

14:20.575 --> 14:21.629
Hello?

14:21.630 --> 14:23.704
You're not still sleeping, are you?

14:23.729 --> 14:26.188
- What time is it?
- 10:00 a.m.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.574
Listen, you better start doing

14:27.606 --> 14:29.487
whatever actor-y shit it is
you need to do to get ready

14:29.511 --> 14:30.891
because you've only got two hours.

14:30.974 --> 14:32.735
Until what?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.889
Until you read with Kyle West.

14:34.890 --> 14:37.139
- What?
- I did it.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.973
- They're calling you back.
- No, Leslie.

14:38.974 --> 14:40.389
The callback can't be today.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.286
I have been throwing up all night.

14:42.311 --> 14:44.351
That's hilarious.

14:44.376 --> 14:46.889
Okay, now stop screwing
around and get focused

14:46.890 --> 14:50.876
because today is the most
important day of your life.

15:06.077 --> 15:09.069
The good news... Lisbeth
is staying at the Bulgari,

15:09.094 --> 15:10.894
which is more than a
mile from where we'll be.

15:12.151 --> 15:14.523
The real news... what's that?

15:14.785 --> 15:17.003
The real news is her table

15:17.028 --> 15:18.900
is next to yours at the opening dinner.

15:18.916 --> 15:21.130
She's replacing Jessica Alba
at the "Blue Waters" panel,

15:21.155 --> 15:23.582
and her film screens
two hours before "AWOL."

15:23.583 --> 15:24.812
It's gonna be a shitshow.

15:24.837 --> 15:26.170
We can get the seating
arrangements changed.

15:26.194 --> 15:27.915
I can back you out of
the "Blue Waters" event.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.874
Just go full narcissist douche-bag

15:29.875 --> 15:31.481
because I'm uncomfortable? No, no, no.

15:31.506 --> 15:33.380
Look, people will see right through it.

15:33.775 --> 15:35.540
I have to actually figure out

15:35.541 --> 15:37.374
a way to deal with this.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.443
Let me know if anything changes.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.776
I want you to consider something.

15:45.046 --> 15:47.582
The tension you're
experiencing right now,

15:47.583 --> 15:49.790
can you be open to the possibility

15:49.791 --> 15:53.415
that it's not about Lisbeth or Venice

15:53.416 --> 15:56.423
or what might or might not happen there?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.857
What else would it be about?

16:02.125 --> 16:04.412
It would be about...

16:05.642 --> 16:07.790
what's happening right here...

16:11.980 --> 16:13.660
between us...

16:15.541 --> 16:17.317
and...

16:18.083 --> 16:20.420
what we both know...

16:21.750 --> 16:24.047
has to happen next.

16:54.761 --> 16:56.446
Still in love?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.571
The bike?

16:59.596 --> 17:00.665
Better be.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.578
Spent enough time building it.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.080
And how are you feeling about you?

17:05.106 --> 17:06.501
Good.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.164
I'm good.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.184
You sure? 'Cause...

17:10.424 --> 17:12.297
I don't know exactly what
I'm picking up, but...

17:12.320 --> 17:14.583
I wouldn't call it good.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.146
Usual stuff.

17:17.147 --> 17:19.314
Well, we all have our stuff.

17:19.315 --> 17:21.480
Right-size it, get present
with your narrative.

17:21.481 --> 17:23.597
You've done it a hundred times.

17:25.397 --> 17:27.230
Hey, you want to blow this off?

17:27.231 --> 17:29.964
Take a ride up to Angeles
National, tear it up?

17:31.065 --> 17:32.480
Thanks.

17:32.481 --> 17:34.075
I want to work.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.202
I promise, Terence,

17:37.227 --> 17:38.709
I'm good.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.072
My job has been to know you

17:49.097 --> 17:50.971
better than you know yourself.

17:51.065 --> 17:53.814
So I could design the
perfect way to kill you.

17:53.815 --> 17:55.869
You will respond,

17:55.894 --> 17:57.812
and the Agency will be waiting.

17:57.837 --> 18:01.067
It is fool-proof.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.605
Very nice. Thank you.

18:03.606 --> 18:06.105
Yeah, that was great.

18:06.106 --> 18:07.897
Really? I was so nervous.

18:07.898 --> 18:09.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:09.398 --> 18:10.730
I couldn't tell at all.
I kept telling myself,

18:10.731 --> 18:12.772
"God, this girl's really, really good."

18:12.773 --> 18:14.627
You were so good.

18:21.899 --> 18:23.589
Who the hell was that supposed to be?

18:23.614 --> 18:25.897
- Um, Gretchen Dvor...
- Yeah, I know who she is.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.458
But who is she supposed to be?

18:27.483 --> 18:30.244
Simple, CIA pod person? Is that it?

18:30.269 --> 18:31.897
Is anybody interested in coming in here

18:31.898 --> 18:33.821
and just being a human being?

18:33.846 --> 18:36.825
Just a normal human being?

18:36.981 --> 18:38.779
I will check.

18:39.648 --> 18:41.230
These women... I swear...

18:41.231 --> 18:43.980
I feel more connected to
the goats in my backyard.

18:43.981 --> 18:45.730
At least I know they're goats.

18:45.731 --> 18:47.133
We can always revisit this.

18:47.158 --> 18:48.814
No, this is not about me, Terence.

18:48.815 --> 18:50.647
Megan Morrison, everybody.

18:50.943 --> 18:52.990
This is our director, Andres Plank.

18:53.015 --> 18:54.324
Welcome.

18:55.570 --> 18:56.772
This is Kyle West.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.147
Megan. Hey, how are you?

18:59.148 --> 19:01.412
Just fine. Are we sitting?

19:01.437 --> 19:03.279
Whatever you like.

19:05.773 --> 19:07.456
And, whenever you're ready.

19:14.148 --> 19:15.814
I'm going to Oslo.

19:15.815 --> 19:17.880
It's the only way to stop this.

19:20.155 --> 19:23.196
What makes you think
that you can stop it?

19:26.975 --> 19:30.374
Even if you make it
there, you won't survive.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.953
The Agency has a kill plan, and...

19:34.453 --> 19:36.326
it's already in place.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.513
How do you know?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.481
How do you know?

19:44.752 --> 19:46.926
Because I crafted it.

19:48.029 --> 19:50.600
That's what I do, Zev.

19:51.425 --> 19:53.467
That's who I am.

19:56.458 --> 19:59.301
It will happen during the day.

20:00.101 --> 20:02.146
Someone that you trust

20:02.171 --> 20:03.766
will need your help,

20:03.791 --> 20:05.320
and you will respond.

20:05.345 --> 20:07.172
No. No, no, I won't.

20:07.197 --> 20:08.974
You will, Zev.

20:11.496 --> 20:14.553
I have spent hundreds
of hours studying you,

20:15.333 --> 20:19.147
your habits, your body language,

20:19.499 --> 20:22.123
every inflection in your voice.

20:22.552 --> 20:25.374
For years, my job...

20:25.375 --> 20:27.456
was to know you better
than you know yourself

20:27.481 --> 20:31.061
so that I can design the
perfect way to kill you.

20:32.708 --> 20:34.775
You will respond,

20:35.458 --> 20:38.037
and the Agency will be waiting.

20:39.458 --> 20:40.996
It's fool-proof.

20:48.422 --> 20:50.337
Thank you.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.583
Thank you.

21:15.628 --> 21:16.815
Megan, wait.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.484
Hey, Megan. Where have you been?

21:18.485 --> 21:19.693
That was amazing.

21:19.694 --> 21:22.470
You are amazing.

21:24.570 --> 21:26.177
Are you okay?

21:26.903 --> 21:29.194
Yeah, it was just, um...

21:29.195 --> 21:31.636
it was just a really heavy
scene, you know? And...

21:31.661 --> 21:33.950
it's been a long 24 hours,

21:33.975 --> 21:36.485
so I-I-I probably just
shouldn't be around

21:36.509 --> 21:37.968
actual people right now.

21:37.993 --> 21:41.193
Look, I just wanted to say
thank you for making my day.

21:41.195 --> 21:43.790
That was what acting is supposed to be.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.299
Thank you.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.465
That's very, very sweet.

21:54.616 --> 21:56.124
Are you hungry?

21:56.156 --> 21:57.766
Can I take you to lunch?

22:22.519 --> 22:24.104
Kyle, take off your helmet!

22:24.129 --> 22:25.459
My God!

22:25.867 --> 22:27.391
Who's the girl?

22:27.416 --> 22:29.478
Kyle, take off your helmet!

22:29.724 --> 22:31.444
How do they recognize you?

22:31.445 --> 22:33.137
They recognize the bike.

22:33.162 --> 22:34.744
Hold on.

22:55.904 --> 22:57.610
Best fish tacos in LA.

22:57.611 --> 23:00.237
- It's closed.
- Not for us.

23:05.976 --> 23:08.094
My God. It's too good.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.792
I can't speak.

23:10.986 --> 23:12.319
Back when I was broke and desperate,

23:12.320 --> 23:13.985
Carlito let me eat here every day.

23:13.986 --> 23:16.485
Then he paid me back by
putting my son through college.

23:16.486 --> 23:18.238
I knew what I was doing.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.622
Stay as long as you want, my friend.

23:21.050 --> 23:23.186
- Gracias.
- Thank you.

23:28.195 --> 23:29.535
So...

23:30.195 --> 23:33.465
what does the broke and
desperate Kyle West look like?

23:34.569 --> 23:36.576
You really want to know?

23:37.195 --> 23:38.909
Okay.

23:39.290 --> 23:41.360
All right, first month in LA,

23:41.361 --> 23:44.027
fresh off the boat from
Lone Grove, Oklahoma,

23:44.028 --> 23:46.485
I'm running late to an
audition I'm never going to get,

23:46.486 --> 23:48.360
and my car's being held
together with duct tape,

23:48.361 --> 23:51.539
and the woman in front of
me stops at a yellow light.

23:51.695 --> 23:54.027
So I honk my horn, and
I pull around side of her

23:54.028 --> 23:56.527
thinking that I'll just pass
her when the light changes.

23:56.528 --> 23:59.110
She rolls down her window and says,

23:59.111 --> 24:00.985
"Because you honked your horn at me,"

24:00.986 --> 24:03.027
"you are gonna go straight to hell."

24:04.137 --> 24:05.836
"And those good looks can't save you."

24:05.861 --> 24:08.485
And all I kept thinking
about in that moment was,

24:08.486 --> 24:10.402
"Does she really
think I'm good-looking?"

24:12.195 --> 24:13.485
All right, your turn.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.402
You... you said
you had a long 24 hours.

24:15.403 --> 24:17.149
- No, no. No.
- What does that look like?

24:17.174 --> 24:19.194
No, we're not at that
portion of the program yet.

24:19.195 --> 24:21.069
- We're not?
- No.

24:21.070 --> 24:24.260
First, we need to talk
about the three imperatives.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.694
Maximum security prison.

24:28.719 --> 24:30.067
That was amazing.

24:30.092 --> 24:33.235
But the questions... they're
bullshit, aren't they?

24:33.236 --> 24:35.235
The thing that reveals
a person's true character

24:35.236 --> 24:36.860
is their reaction to being told

24:36.861 --> 24:39.902
that their true character
is gonna be revealed.

24:39.903 --> 24:42.069
No comment.

24:42.070 --> 24:44.069
But you're smart.

24:44.070 --> 24:47.700
So, what, did you just
come up with that yourself?

24:48.653 --> 24:51.318
The three imperatives were
Terence Anderson's idea.

24:51.343 --> 24:53.110
Terence And... I know that name.

24:53.111 --> 24:55.194
Yeah, he runs the Institute
for the Higher Mind.

24:55.195 --> 24:57.375
He's also my best friend.

24:57.611 --> 24:59.610
So one day he just
called you up and said,

24:59.889 --> 25:02.800
"Hey, brah, I have this idea
for this awesome mind game."

25:02.825 --> 25:04.465
"You should try it at
your next audition."

25:05.198 --> 25:06.444
You know, Terence
just wants to make sure

25:06.445 --> 25:08.777
that the good actors we work
with are also good people.

25:08.778 --> 25:11.610
His wife, DeAnn, is actually
my producing partner.

25:11.867 --> 25:13.990
You guys must go back a long way.

25:14.015 --> 25:16.597
Terence saw the better
version of me before I did.

25:18.528 --> 25:20.360
Have you ever been up to the Institute?

25:20.361 --> 25:22.274
- Taken a class?
- Nope.

25:22.299 --> 25:25.110
I try to self-help myself
as little as possible.

25:25.111 --> 25:26.277
I get it.

25:26.278 --> 25:28.360
You know, some people find it weird.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.110
Challenging the way we
think about ourselves

25:30.111 --> 25:32.610
and our relationship to
the world and to our past,

25:32.611 --> 25:35.554
it... it can freak people out.

25:36.153 --> 25:38.735
Well, it obviously worked for you.

25:38.926 --> 25:40.768
I wouldn't be here without it.

25:47.961 --> 25:50.032
I actually have a meeting.

25:51.272 --> 25:53.024
Okay.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.819
Do you want to come?

25:56.049 --> 25:58.135
To your meeting?

25:58.160 --> 26:00.110
I'm picturing a very long table

26:00.111 --> 26:02.652
with, like, a bunch of
Japanese businessmen.

26:02.653 --> 26:05.652
It'll be even better than that.

26:05.653 --> 26:07.513
What do you say?

26:20.520 --> 26:22.582
You have your meeting
in an airplane hangar?

26:22.607 --> 26:24.147
What, are you buying a plane?

26:24.172 --> 26:26.057
I have my meeting in Zihuatanejo.

26:26.082 --> 26:27.675
I'm thinking about buying an island.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.383
Wait. What?

26:30.415 --> 26:32.739
An island near
Zihuatanejo. It's in Mexico.

26:32.764 --> 26:35.318
Yeah, I-I know where
that is. I can't go.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.081
Why not? You said you were free.

26:37.082 --> 26:39.331
Well, I was free when I thought
we were going to Thousand Oaks.

26:39.355 --> 26:41.084
I can't go to Mexico.

26:41.109 --> 26:43.248
I don't... I don't
even have my passport.

26:43.249 --> 26:45.703
Trust me, no one's going to
be checking your passport.

26:46.624 --> 26:48.956
Come on, Amelia Earhart,
let's go on an adventure.

26:53.624 --> 26:55.303
You coming?

27:21.487 --> 27:23.141
Mr. Anderson?

27:23.417 --> 27:26.330
I was hoping I could ask you a question.

27:27.084 --> 27:28.663
Alexa.

27:29.108 --> 27:32.123
- Are you enjoying the workshop?
- So much.

27:32.376 --> 27:34.042
I totally see it now...

27:34.043 --> 27:35.754
how past experience is a barrier

27:35.779 --> 27:37.792
between us and our better selves.

27:37.793 --> 27:41.292
But I wonder whether inexperience...

27:41.293 --> 27:43.667
is a bigger obstacle for me.

27:44.293 --> 27:45.939
Where are you from, Alexa?

27:45.964 --> 27:47.625
Cedar Rapids.

27:48.845 --> 27:50.792
I think it's time we
got those false externals

27:50.793 --> 27:52.209
out of your way.

27:58.293 --> 27:59.792
How does that feel?

27:59.793 --> 28:01.917
Lighter.

28:02.279 --> 28:03.783
Thank you.

28:03.808 --> 28:05.970
Inexperience is a gift.

28:17.459 --> 28:19.167
I just had a lovely conversation

28:19.168 --> 28:21.125
with you-know-who's legal team.

28:21.181 --> 28:22.645
Great.

28:23.161 --> 28:26.125
They're worried Kyle's going to do
something inappropriate in Venice.

28:26.126 --> 28:27.792
They threatened to
leak Lisbeth's version

28:27.793 --> 28:29.667
of the breakup if he does.

28:29.668 --> 28:32.167
I cannot believe we let that
woman put our nuts in a sling.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.698
She's paranoid. Nothing's
going to happen in Venice.

28:34.723 --> 28:35.984
Really?

28:36.009 --> 28:37.333
Kyle's not in a good place.

28:37.334 --> 28:39.174
He took that nobody actress to Mexico

28:39.199 --> 28:40.865
after an audition and a taco.

28:40.924 --> 28:43.756
- So?
- So? So it's regressive.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.937
And I looked into her. She's an orphan.

28:45.962 --> 28:47.532
Her father left when she was an infant.

28:47.557 --> 28:49.517
Her mother died when she
was in college... cancer.

28:49.780 --> 28:50.909
Sounds like life.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.438
Yeah, well, life comes with issues.

28:52.463 --> 28:54.922
Then she dropped out of
NYU and completely vanished.

28:54.947 --> 28:57.112
Didn't use credit cards,
no social media, nothing.

28:57.113 --> 28:58.718
Honey, her mom died.

28:58.743 --> 29:00.825
You don't think it's
normal to unplug after that?

29:00.850 --> 29:03.778
No, not... not for four
months. That's not normal.

29:04.282 --> 29:06.615
This girl could be destabilizing
in all sorts of ways,

29:06.640 --> 29:08.889
and Kyle forgets that
his actions reflect on us.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.055
Okay, well, for what it's worth,

29:11.183 --> 29:13.932
my gut tells me that
Megan Morrison is great.

29:14.383 --> 29:16.025
Yeah, well, I thought Lisbeth was great.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.324
That's not the point.

29:17.349 --> 29:19.307
I don't want to clean
up another train wreck.

29:19.367 --> 29:20.803
Okay, well, then let's make sure

29:20.828 --> 29:22.732
this one stays on the rails.

29:26.654 --> 29:28.426
Wow.

29:28.451 --> 29:30.131
This feels like a dream.

29:33.250 --> 29:34.641
You know, you never told me the story

29:34.665 --> 29:36.587
about your long 24 hours.

29:38.266 --> 29:41.015
I don't know... I just,
kind of find you fascinating.

29:42.289 --> 29:44.099
It's not fascinating.

29:47.016 --> 29:49.557
Yesterday I found out
my boyfriend of two years

29:49.558 --> 29:51.523
has been cheating on me.

29:52.862 --> 29:55.222
I'd call that a colossal
error in judgment.

30:02.141 --> 30:03.719
Me too.

30:04.724 --> 30:06.890
When you won the Golden Globe,

30:06.891 --> 30:09.140
was it hard not to cry?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.310
Yes.

30:10.335 --> 30:11.682
Because you worked so hard to get there

30:11.683 --> 30:12.747
and you'd been through so much?

30:12.771 --> 30:15.033
Because I had to go to
the bathroom... badly.

30:15.058 --> 30:16.723
They serve you drinks
at the Golden Globes.

30:16.724 --> 30:17.973
I didn't even know what I said.

30:17.974 --> 30:18.997
Never mind.

30:20.108 --> 30:22.663
Well, I cried when I won the Alphie.

30:23.235 --> 30:24.608
The Alphie?

30:24.633 --> 30:26.598
It's just, like, for best performance

30:26.599 --> 30:28.067
at my high-school talent show.

30:30.516 --> 30:33.377
- I'm sorry. What?
- I worked really hard.

30:33.563 --> 30:35.306
What was your act?

30:35.933 --> 30:37.390
I shouldn't have said anything.

30:37.415 --> 30:38.887
No, no, what was it?

30:41.745 --> 30:43.332
It was a...

30:44.099 --> 30:46.699
a hip-hop tribute to
William Shakespeare.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.432
What?

30:48.457 --> 30:51.074
I was a very big theater
geek in high school, okay?

30:51.099 --> 30:52.572
- Do it.
- So... What?

30:52.597 --> 30:54.763
No, you are doing this.
A hip-hop tribute to Sha...

30:54.788 --> 30:56.371
- You are doing this right now.
- No, no.

30:56.395 --> 30:57.491
You know what? Hey, I got you.

30:57.515 --> 30:58.605
- I got you.
- No way.

30:58.630 --> 31:00.303
I got your beat. Ready?

31:03.811 --> 31:05.383
Okay, okay. No, no, no.

31:05.408 --> 31:06.564
- All right.
- Stop.

31:06.589 --> 31:08.519
Brrp. Brrp.

31:08.614 --> 31:10.973
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

31:10.974 --> 31:13.640
All right.

31:13.641 --> 31:16.473
Do you know the first line to
Hamlet's speech to the players?

31:16.748 --> 31:19.140
Of course. "Speak the
speech, I pray you."

31:52.516 --> 31:53.848
That is the single greatest thing

31:53.873 --> 31:55.770
I've ever witnessed in my life.

31:56.349 --> 31:57.796
Aw.

32:02.878 --> 32:04.920
I have to kiss you now.

33:19.696 --> 33:23.349
Where the hell are you, you asshole?

33:30.016 --> 33:31.848
And cut! Good.

33:32.931 --> 33:35.348
- We need that insert.
- We're gonna get an insert.

33:35.349 --> 33:36.848
We're gonna get an
insert of the coke, Megan.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.682
- You can step out.
- Okay, thanks.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.016
- Second team.
- Thank you.

33:43.099 --> 33:45.265
Fat lady alert. Out of the way.

33:45.266 --> 33:46.447
Hi.

33:46.472 --> 33:48.081
Les, what are you doing here?

33:48.082 --> 33:49.431
I just thought I would waddle on down

33:49.455 --> 33:50.765
and see the magic happen.

33:50.766 --> 33:53.927
Chloe, how are you?

33:55.053 --> 33:56.510
Can we go somewhere to talk?

33:56.614 --> 33:59.161
- Yeah. Yeah, come here.
- Okay.

33:59.808 --> 34:02.489
So... what's going on?

34:02.514 --> 34:07.124
Well, this arrived at
my office this morning.

34:07.766 --> 34:09.480
Please tell me those aren't photos.

34:09.505 --> 34:12.264
Photos? Sweet Jesus.

34:12.266 --> 34:15.473
You had sex with Kyle
West. That explains a lot.

34:15.710 --> 34:17.473
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

34:17.474 --> 34:21.567
Um, we've been presented
with a bit of a situation.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.973
Not gonna lie. It's unusual.

34:23.974 --> 34:27.047
It's a little Bollywood.
It's really weird.

34:27.072 --> 34:29.090
- It's Bollyweird.
- What's in the envelope?

34:29.746 --> 34:32.377
- Sit down.
- I don't want to sit down, Leslie.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.553
- You're freaking me out.
- Okay, well, I want to sit down

34:34.577 --> 34:37.226
because I'm about to face-plant, so...

34:38.370 --> 34:40.067
Okay.

34:42.063 --> 34:45.123
This is an offer from Kyle West.

34:45.321 --> 34:47.940
- For the movie?
- Technically, no.

34:47.966 --> 34:50.244
It's an offer to be...

34:50.268 --> 34:52.018
his next wife.

34:54.391 --> 34:56.239
- His wife?
- Relax.

34:56.248 --> 34:57.962
You start out as the girlfriend, okay?

34:57.987 --> 34:59.319
And then if all of that goes well,

34:59.320 --> 35:01.069
then the official proposal comes,

35:01.070 --> 35:02.990
followed by the engagement
period, and then,

35:03.015 --> 35:05.986
if you want the full 10 million...

35:05.987 --> 35:08.338
- $10 million?
- Paid in installments.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.646
Most of it comes after the wedding.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.906
And then there's also language
in here about children,

35:11.931 --> 35:13.430
which involves a second agreement,

35:13.431 --> 35:14.930
and then, of course, whatever
you get in the divorce,

35:14.931 --> 35:16.209
but that part's not commissionable.

35:16.233 --> 35:19.650
- You should know that.
- Leslie, th... this isn't real.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.855
- This is completely real.
- No, it isn't.

35:22.856 --> 35:24.656
This is Kyle's version of a joke.

35:26.118 --> 35:27.712
Sweetie...

35:27.909 --> 35:31.268
this is Kyle's version of a proposal.

35:31.293 --> 35:34.000
He's offering you a contract marriage.

35:34.025 --> 35:35.781
Let me see this.

35:42.091 --> 35:44.632
"No infidelity.

35:44.633 --> 35:47.117
"No drug use.

35:47.514 --> 35:50.680
"Approval of all of my
interaction with the media"?

35:50.705 --> 35:53.965
I don't get this. I've
known this guy for two days.

35:53.966 --> 35:56.628
Well, you and your 25-year-old
vagina made quite an impression.

35:56.653 --> 35:58.613
- Hey.
- Megan...

36:00.050 --> 36:01.882
I know this is not how we
thought we were going to take

36:01.883 --> 36:04.049
your career to the next
level, but, sweetie,

36:04.050 --> 36:05.715
if you sign this contract,

36:05.716 --> 36:09.215
you are going to be able
to do whatever you want.

36:09.216 --> 36:12.382
No. There's no way that I'm doing this.

36:18.859 --> 36:20.865
Did I do something wrong?

36:21.090 --> 36:22.698
Not at all.

36:22.699 --> 36:26.157
In fact, Kyle had nothing but
good things to say about you.

36:26.327 --> 36:28.293
I don't understand, though.

36:29.222 --> 36:31.198
The arrangement just ran its course.

36:31.769 --> 36:32.990
But I wanted to thank you.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.865
Your contribution the last
few weeks was very important.

36:36.181 --> 36:40.406
We should talk about getting you
involved in other Institute projects.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.043
It's not going to be that easy.

36:44.805 --> 36:46.198
What do you mean?

36:46.199 --> 36:47.865
I lived in that unbelievable house

36:47.866 --> 36:49.927
with his hands on me every night.

36:50.030 --> 36:52.573
I don't want to go back to reality,

36:52.803 --> 36:54.919
and I won't do it quietly.

36:57.217 --> 36:59.392
The so-called therapist, Sophie...

36:59.416 --> 37:01.249
she's not cooperating.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.265
We need to get her on board.

37:03.290 --> 37:04.956
What can I do?

37:05.084 --> 37:08.583
Get her into the facility quietly.

37:08.584 --> 37:11.584
- Can you handle that?
- Absolutely.

37:25.061 --> 37:27.458
Hey. Thanks for coming.

37:27.459 --> 37:28.791
If you want to avoid the paparazzi,

37:28.792 --> 37:30.853
why don't we just meet at your house?

37:31.076 --> 37:34.501
This is actually more
private, believe it or not.

37:38.284 --> 37:39.886
So...

37:40.784 --> 37:43.791
you want me to play
the girl on your arm...

37:43.792 --> 37:45.750
so you can do what?

37:45.751 --> 37:48.750
- What's your big secret?
- There's no big secret.

37:48.751 --> 37:50.091
I mean, after what we did last night,

37:50.115 --> 37:51.767
do you think I'm really
looking for a beard?

37:51.768 --> 37:53.544
I don't know.

37:53.569 --> 37:57.004
- You're an actor.
- I'm not that good.

37:57.029 --> 37:59.036
Wait, Kyle.

38:01.251 --> 38:04.112
If you like me, then
why don't we just date

38:04.137 --> 38:05.636
and see where this goes?

38:05.637 --> 38:07.706
Why are we talking about marriage?

38:07.731 --> 38:09.333
God, you have no idea

38:09.334 --> 38:11.376
how much I wish that I could just...

38:11.667 --> 38:13.424
just date.

38:13.829 --> 38:16.333
I don't know if you're
after me for my money

38:16.334 --> 38:17.666
or to advance your career.

38:17.667 --> 38:19.318
I would never do those things.

38:19.343 --> 38:21.986
If we just got to know each other

38:22.011 --> 38:25.000
like regular people, you would see that.

38:25.001 --> 38:26.333
When you met your boyfriend,

38:26.334 --> 38:29.255
did you think he was actually the
type of guy that would cheat on you?

38:30.024 --> 38:33.572
I never thought Lisbeth would
just bail on me at our wedding.

38:35.001 --> 38:37.297
Did she ever explain herself?

38:40.167 --> 38:41.666
There was a note...

38:41.667 --> 38:44.417
something about getting
lost in my world.

38:46.321 --> 38:48.763
Look, this contract's
not about making sure

38:48.788 --> 38:50.541
that my feelings don't get hurt.

38:50.566 --> 38:52.034
I don't...

38:52.059 --> 38:54.286
I don't understand, then.

38:54.311 --> 38:56.541
It's about my reputation.

38:56.863 --> 38:58.655
It's about my...

39:01.938 --> 39:04.732
it's about my brand...

39:05.667 --> 39:07.458
the people that are relying
on me to be the actor

39:07.459 --> 39:09.647
that everybody has to
have in their movie.

39:12.209 --> 39:14.291
Megan, look, when I'm with you,

39:14.292 --> 39:16.375
all the bullshit, it just...

39:16.532 --> 39:18.666
it melts away.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.492
Okay? And I...

39:20.611 --> 39:23.541
I feel like me.

39:24.959 --> 39:27.916
I think that you are amazing.

39:27.917 --> 39:31.389
But if Kyle West gets humiliated
again, well, then that is a pattern,

39:31.414 --> 39:33.125
and that pattern's
bad for business, okay?

39:33.150 --> 39:35.648
That's what the contract
and the money are for.

39:37.966 --> 39:40.476
That sounds so sad.

39:41.350 --> 39:43.515
Is this all worth it?

39:43.540 --> 39:45.527
I honestly don't know.

39:47.059 --> 39:49.646
But I feel like with you...

39:49.833 --> 39:51.518
it would be.

39:53.458 --> 39:56.123
- We just met.
- I know.

39:56.124 --> 39:57.457
It's crazy. It...

39:57.458 --> 39:59.278
this is all crazy, but...

39:59.618 --> 40:01.944
I-I've got this feeling

40:01.969 --> 40:03.934
that I am almost certain of,

40:03.968 --> 40:06.650
that if we just go for it...

40:07.041 --> 40:08.873
You should come to Venice with me.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.040
To Italy?

40:11.041 --> 40:14.525
Don't... don't you ever
just chill and go to the zoo?

40:14.550 --> 40:17.591
Look, my movie closes
the festival next week.

40:17.592 --> 40:19.869
We could go see a bunch of
films, go to some parties,

40:19.886 --> 40:21.760
maybe do a couple of days at Lake Como.

40:23.218 --> 40:25.177
You don't have to give me an answer now.

40:25.178 --> 40:26.885
Take a couple of days.

40:26.886 --> 40:28.344
Think about it.

40:28.345 --> 40:30.463
You'd be crazy not to.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.097
A couple of days...

40:34.122 --> 40:37.787
to decide what I am
doing with, potentially,

40:38.067 --> 40:40.192
the rest of my life.

40:42.053 --> 40:43.594
Yeah.

40:57.687 --> 41:00.431
Kyle West gave you three orgasms?

41:00.457 --> 41:01.922
Almost four.

41:01.946 --> 41:06.250
Almost four orgasms on the
porch of a Mexican bungalow?

41:06.530 --> 41:09.445
Gi... you should be
paying him $10 million.

41:09.446 --> 41:12.192
All right, can we just forget
about the sex for a minute, please?

41:12.217 --> 41:13.529
I can't.

41:13.530 --> 41:15.279
I mean, number one, I just can't.

41:15.280 --> 41:18.279
And two, that's what this is.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.612
Kyle's a stupidly hot
guy with a private jet

41:20.613 --> 41:22.841
and some special skills.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.445
I mean, we're not talking
long-term potential here.

41:26.446 --> 41:29.659
So you think I'm crazy
for considering this?

41:30.100 --> 41:32.287
I think you're on the rebound,

41:32.312 --> 41:33.630
and he has major trust issues.

41:33.655 --> 41:35.320
Have you looked at the
language in this contract?

41:35.321 --> 41:38.820
He's expecting you to be,
like, the perfect girlfriend.

41:38.821 --> 41:41.070
And I'm sorry,

41:41.071 --> 41:44.504
but we both know you
haven't been perfect.

41:45.385 --> 41:46.963
I knew you would bring that up.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.756
You're welcome.

41:48.853 --> 41:52.154
It's a land mine. It
can blow everything up.

41:52.155 --> 41:54.987
I know, but I still
have to live my life.

41:54.988 --> 41:58.487
Well, you'd be taking a big risk.

41:58.585 --> 42:02.252
And that's worse than waiting
tables for the rest of my life?

42:02.728 --> 42:05.924
I mean, and what if
Kyle and I are amazing?

42:05.949 --> 42:07.716
- God, you did not just...
- I'm serious, Shaun.

42:07.740 --> 42:11.154
No, look, I've never met
anybody like this guy.

42:11.179 --> 42:14.088
He totally got me
right away, and I-I know

42:14.113 --> 42:15.529
that we've only spent a day together...

42:15.530 --> 42:17.759
but... it feels like I've known him

42:17.784 --> 42:20.211
for so much longer than that.

42:21.118 --> 42:23.529
I know, but...

42:23.530 --> 42:26.372
maybe it's because somehow...

42:26.423 --> 42:28.715
he's what I've been looking for.

42:31.030 --> 42:34.612
Look, there's no law that
says you have to decide now.

42:34.613 --> 42:35.945
You should wait.

42:35.946 --> 42:38.445
Wait till he gets back from Venice.

42:38.446 --> 42:40.025
Then give him an answer.

42:41.305 --> 42:43.034
I could.

42:43.696 --> 42:46.320
But it'd be really nice to go to Venice.

43:17.238 --> 43:18.879
There you are.

43:20.738 --> 43:22.029
Here I am.

43:25.905 --> 43:28.363
Hello to you, too.

43:42.196 --> 43:44.036
So this is your place?

43:44.470 --> 43:46.292
This is my place.

43:47.195 --> 43:48.862
Come on.

43:52.613 --> 43:54.667
Wow.

43:55.071 --> 43:57.404
I bought it from one of
the guys in Foreigner.

43:57.405 --> 43:59.779
He had the walls covered in velvet...

43:59.984 --> 44:01.635
a whole different narrative.

44:01.660 --> 44:03.679
Your view.

44:08.219 --> 44:10.163
My God.

44:11.478 --> 44:13.392
Bergland.

44:16.066 --> 44:19.154
When I was in college, I
would spend hours at MOMA

44:19.155 --> 44:21.988
just escaping into his world.

44:23.423 --> 44:25.511
Take me with you.

44:28.455 --> 44:29.844
Hello.

44:30.836 --> 44:33.877
Terence Anderson,
this is Megan Morrison.

44:33.902 --> 44:36.460
Playing Megan Morrison this time.

44:36.461 --> 44:38.417
Hardest role of all.

44:39.693 --> 44:41.901
Well, I'm a very big fan of yours.

44:43.128 --> 44:45.211
Shall we take care of business?

44:48.742 --> 44:52.305
Talent gets you noticed... maybe.

44:52.684 --> 44:55.219
And looks, sure, for a moment.

44:55.933 --> 44:58.973
But the only thing that gets you
a seat at the table in this town

44:58.974 --> 45:01.072
is force of personality.

45:01.558 --> 45:03.826
I'm talking about complete...

45:03.851 --> 45:07.095
and utter confidence in who you are.

45:07.485 --> 45:09.291
When you have that,

45:09.316 --> 45:11.841
people are drawn to you.

45:12.224 --> 45:15.347
They don't know why, but
suddenly they need you.

45:15.433 --> 45:17.932
And they will turn
their lives inside out

45:17.933 --> 45:19.991
to be with you.

45:21.253 --> 45:23.432
But you have to work your ass off.

45:23.433 --> 45:25.473
You have to be the one
willing to do the things

45:25.474 --> 45:28.240
that scare everybody else to death.

45:30.558 --> 45:34.599
That's the difference
between talent and success.

45:36.088 --> 45:38.140
You're off to a great start,

45:38.141 --> 45:40.473
but you have to keep doing it.

45:40.498 --> 45:42.176
I plan to.

45:42.201 --> 45:44.032
Okay, Annika.

45:44.239 --> 45:47.358
Let's see what we can do
about getting you an agent.
