<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

I need something. I need something.

00:19.819 --> 00:22.055
<i>With $25,000 in their bank,</i>

00:22.122 --> 00:25.058
<i>three home cooks will have</i>

00:28.428 --> 00:30.330

<i>will go home</i>

00:43.443 --> 00:44.444

<i>to the hottest names</i>

<i>will prepare the mystery boxes,</i>

00:54.421 --> 00:57.424
<i>ingredient temptations,</i>
<i>and judge the dishes.</i>

00:57.490 --> 00:58.958
You gotta make Mama happy.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.294
All right, Chef. Send out those boxes.

01:02.495 --> 01:06.766
<i>It's the ultimate cooking competition</i>
<i>where skill meets strategy.</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:08.835
Let me get my buzzer fingers ready.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.970
<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

01:11.604 --> 01:14.607
All right, home chefs! Are y'all ready?

01:14.674 --> 01:16.176
-Whoo!
-Do it, let's do it.

01:16.242 --> 01:20.246
Nick, Vivian, Ryan,
welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>

01:20.313 --> 01:21.181
Let's go.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.318
In this round, you'll be creating a dish

01:25.385 --> 01:29.956
in any style that you choose
using one of three ingredient boxes.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.926
Those boxes, along with everything else
you'll be cooking with,

01:32.992 --> 01:35.395
will be coming into the kitchen
along the line,

01:36.029 --> 01:39.432
and it leads to the back pantry
and our guest chef and judge.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.103
She burst onto the scene
at only 28 years old.

01:43.169 --> 01:47.474
The proud owner of Mokbar
and Ms. Yoo cocktail bar in New York City,

01:47.540 --> 01:48.708
Chef Esther Choi.

01:50.743 --> 01:51.878
Whoo!

01:51.945 --> 01:54.147
Esther Choi
is definitely an inspiration.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.684
She's a fellow Korean American,
and she's doing great things.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.752
I'm so excited
to be cooking for her today.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.555
Right now,
Chef Choi is preparing ingredients

02:02.622 --> 02:04.891
for three very different boxes.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.827
Chef Choi, please send out those boxes.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.770
You'll start
by using your bank of 25k

02:17.837 --> 02:21.174
to blindly bid on
these three ingredient boxes.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.712
The cook with the highest bid
gets the Spend Box,

02:25.778 --> 02:29.582
which has high-quality ingredients
to help you create a high-quality dish.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.886
The lowest bid gets the Save Box,

02:32.952 --> 02:35.421
which is made up of basic grocery items.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.490
So, you're gonna have
to get creative with it.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.760
And the cook caught
in the middle gets the Surprise Box,

02:41.694 --> 02:45.131
which contains unique ingredients that'll
really put your skills to the test.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.701
But in the end, only one of you will win

02:48.768 --> 02:51.804
and walk away with whatever cash
you have left in your bank.

02:51.871 --> 02:55.742
Okay. You'll have to enter
a minimum bid of $2,500,

02:55.808 --> 02:57.544
and you can lock in your bids now.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.282
My bidding strategy is to bid low

03:02.348 --> 03:05.785
because I feel more comfortable
with the Save Box.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.055
I'm not like a lobster/caviar guy.
I have two little kids.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.192
I have daycare costs. Come on. I mean,
we're not doing that kind of thing.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.727
I really want the Spend Box

03:14.794 --> 03:17.163
because I wanna make a splash
in the first round.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.665
So money is no object.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.467
Okay, Ryan, let's take a look at your bid.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.605
$3,500. Someone's trying to spend.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.642
All right, Nick. $2,510.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.078
$10 over the minimum.
I see where you're going.

03:32.145 --> 03:36.249
And Vivian. $2,501.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.117
Oh! Okay.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.487
That means Ryan, you bought the Spend Box,

03:41.554 --> 03:43.823
and your bank
has been adjusted accordingly.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.491
Vivian, you bought the Save Box.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.662
-And Nick, I hope you like surprises.
-We'll find out.

03:52.131 --> 03:55.134
Home cooks, you have
45 minutes to make your dish,

03:55.802 --> 03:58.738
but be ready,
'cause you never know what ingredients

03:58.805 --> 04:00.807
Chef Choi might be sending down the line

04:01.307 --> 04:03.610
that you will have
the opportunity to bid on.

04:04.677 --> 04:08.881
Nick, Vivian, Ryan,
are you ready to cook at all costs?

04:08.948 --> 04:09.849
-Ready.
-Ready.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.883
Oh, yeah.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.286
Well, good, 'cause your time starts now!

04:21.928 --> 04:25.231
Oh, rib eye, Taleggio. Okay.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.567
I am pretty excited
that I got the Spend Box.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.936
Cabernet Sauvignon. Okay.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.673
Because I have a dry-aged rib eye steak,
which is a luxury cut of beef,

04:33.740 --> 04:36.042
Taleggio cheese, one of
my favorite Italian cheeses,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.278
and kale,
which I literally cook every day.

04:38.878 --> 04:41.114
I spent $3,500 on this Spend Box.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.884
And honestly, that's probably what I'd
spend in New York for that steak anyways.

04:45.385 --> 04:52.225
Cabbage, smoked Gouda, maybe cilantro,
chili powder, and ground beef.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.626
When I open the Save Box,

04:53.693 --> 04:57.897
I see ground beef,
smoked Gouda cheese, some cabbage.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.667
I think that I can take
these humble ingredients

05:00.733 --> 05:02.635
and transform it into a delicious dish.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.737
Um, burgers.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.773
At first, my mind goes
straight to a hamburger,

05:06.839 --> 05:09.609
but then I quickly realize,
"Oh, I don't have a bun."

05:09.676 --> 05:10.943
Um…

05:11.010 --> 05:12.345
What am I going to cook?

05:13.713 --> 05:17.617
Oh, Vermouth! Good.
It's not a cocktail-making show.

05:17.684 --> 05:21.621
In my Surprise Box, there is
a crazy assortment of ingredients.

05:21.688 --> 05:25.558
Vermouth, rapini, blue cheese, and…

05:25.625 --> 05:28.795
Oh, God.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.198
…a whole beef heart.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.971
I'm just staring at this massive thing.

05:40.773 --> 05:41.641
Okay.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.809
Ooh!

05:43.576 --> 05:45.878
Okay, the proteins are revealed.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.381
We've got some dry-aged rib eye
in the Spend Box,

05:48.448 --> 05:50.316
ground beef in the Save Box,

05:50.383 --> 05:53.152
and the protein for Surprise, beef heart.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.621
-What am I doing with this, Jordan?
-You got a big heart.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.490
Big heart, whoo! Okay.

05:57.557 --> 06:01.094
I'm a dad. I am constantly being judged
for my cooking.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.798
Every meal, there is some complaint
about what Dad has done incorrectly,

06:05.865 --> 06:08.167
so I can definitely cook on the fly,

06:08.234 --> 06:11.204
on the ground, in the water,
wherever you want me to cook.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.573
Oh, what to do with this?

06:13.639 --> 06:14.907
Oh, God.

06:14.974 --> 06:17.076
Actually, you know what?
Where'd that vermouth go?

06:17.143 --> 06:18.811
I'm just gonna try this.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.849
I realize that I can marinate
my beef heart with vermouth

06:22.915 --> 06:24.484
and then grill it, basically.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.087
And I can make rapini
and blue cheese fritters.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.322
Okay, I like it.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.129
My steak's seasoned.

06:36.195 --> 06:39.565
I know what I'm gonna do with the steak.
I don't wanna throw it on the grill,

06:39.632 --> 06:41.667
because I want
a nice brown crust on my rib eye.

06:42.635 --> 06:47.607
I want some sort of Taleggio steak sauce
and then a sautéed kale.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.942
I was a semi-professional rugby player
for years.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.146
Competition is something
I've been doing my entire life.

06:53.212 --> 06:57.617
I'm hoping to show Chef Choi that I know
how to cook a luxury cut of beef.

06:58.151 --> 07:02.255
Saying I'm a Michelin-star cook
is probably being a little too immodest,

07:02.321 --> 07:04.991
but I would describe myself
as having Michelin-star talent.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.526
I cook these all the time.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.865
-Hey, hey.
-Yo!

07:12.932 --> 07:15.401
What are you working on?
Some upgrades? What do you have here?

07:15.468 --> 07:19.205
Filet mignon,
which I am tying bacon to it.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.707
So you get bacon, you get the fillet.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.176
-Yeah.
-It's a nice upgrade.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.245
Which box do you think
the filet mignon would help the most?

07:26.312 --> 07:30.583
So I feel like the Surprise Box
with the beef heart.

07:31.684 --> 07:34.620
You know, as a home cook, you might
not be used to cooking beef heart,

07:34.687 --> 07:38.024
and if you don't cook it right,
it could be very… bad.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.259
-Yeah. Just terrible, chewy, mealy…
-Yeah, yeah.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.327
-Gamey.
-…gamey.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.529
So the filet, obviously,

07:43.596 --> 07:45.998
beautiful piece of meat,
and really forgiving.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.300
-Hard to mess up.
-Yeah, true.

07:47.366 --> 07:50.736
What do you think is in the Spend Box
that makes it worth the big bucks?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.573
So the Spend Box
has so many nice ingredients.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.343
Obviously the dry-aged rib eye.
You have the Taleggio,

07:57.410 --> 08:00.313
which goes really nice
with the dry-aged rib eye.

08:00.379 --> 08:02.682
It has like sure winners
in that box, right?

08:02.748 --> 08:03.816
-I agree.
-Mm-hmm.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.918
I know you got a few
other upgrades up your sleeve.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.720
When these upgrades are ready,
send them out.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.121
Okay, let's do it.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.865
I'm very competitive.
I've run seven marathons.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.333
I was in a marching band in college,

08:20.399 --> 08:23.002
where you had to compete
for a spot on the field every single week,

08:23.069 --> 08:24.370
and I came here to win.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.106
So I'm gonna give 150%
to this competition.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.810
I am going to make meatballs
stuffed with the Gouda cheese.

08:30.877 --> 08:33.946
A burger's out of the question,
so my next thought is a meatball.

08:34.013 --> 08:38.150
I'm making smoked Gouda-stuffed
fried meatballs with a tangy slaw.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.954
But the biggest challenge with my Save Box
is that I'm missing a starch.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.965
Looks like it's time
for your first live auction.

08:53.566 --> 08:54.400
My favorite part.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.739
My strategy for this auction
is to bid on ingredients that I need,

08:59.805 --> 09:02.575
but I'm also gonna bid on ingredients
that the other contestants need

09:02.642 --> 09:04.377
just to drive up the price a little bit.

09:04.443 --> 09:08.447
Your first item up
for bid is… yellow potatoes.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.753
Meat and potatoes, perfect pair.
I need to get those.

09:13.819 --> 09:16.088
The opening bid is $500.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.190
-And the auction starts now.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.759
We got $500 going to Vivian.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.260
-Do I hear $600?

09:21.327 --> 09:23.029
-Do I have $700?

09:23.095 --> 09:25.264
-Do I have $800?

09:25.331 --> 09:27.133
-Do I have $1,000?

09:27.199 --> 09:30.503
$1,000 going once, going twice…

09:30.570 --> 09:32.672
-Sold! Sold to Vivian.

09:33.172 --> 09:35.775
$1,000 for potatoes?

09:37.643 --> 09:39.445
All right, the next upgrade is…

09:40.079 --> 09:42.181
heavy cream for $800.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.817
This could really add
some richness to your dish.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.687
Oh my God. I actually could use cream,
like, right now.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.624
I could make a sauce out of it,
which would be unbelievable.

09:51.691 --> 09:54.627
I really need
a liquid dairy component

09:54.694 --> 09:56.562
to pull my kale together.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.464
I'm gonna pay
whatever I need to pay for it.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.333
-$800 for heavy cream.
-I'll take it!

10:00.399 --> 10:03.903
Oh, there it is! $800 for heavy cream!

10:03.970 --> 10:05.171
-Do I have $1,000?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.740
Oh, $1,000! Ryan wants the cream.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.076
-I love it!
-He's just trying to mess with me.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.612
$1,000 for heavy cream
going once, going twice…

10:12.678 --> 10:15.381
Sold for $1,000 to Ryan

10:15.448 --> 10:17.850
for 16 ounces of heavy cream.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.119
Congratulations. Wow.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.989
My goal is to leave the show
with as much money as possible.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.224
So, fine, take it, dude.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.327
-Enjoy that cream, sir. Enjoy that cream.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.829
You know what? I wanna have some fun.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.832
So up next I'm not gonna tell you
what it is. It's a blind bid.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.568
-Let's just start the bidding at $700.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.802
-There you go!

10:36.869 --> 10:39.872
Vivian wants to know what it is.
Do I have $900?

10:39.939 --> 10:41.307
-Yeah, 900.
-$900 from Nick?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.175
-Do I have $1,100?

10:43.242 --> 10:46.212
Oh, there it is! $1,100 from Vivian.
Let's go!

10:46.278 --> 10:48.447
$1,100 going once, going twice…

10:48.514 --> 10:51.584
Sold to Vivian! $1,100. What did you buy?

10:52.084 --> 10:53.953
-Onion jam.
-Love it.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.321
-$1,100 for onion jam.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.491
At this point during my cook, I feel
there's something sweet missing,

10:58.557 --> 11:00.192
so I can make this work.

11:01.894 --> 11:06.165
All right. Our final upgrade
is bacon-wrapped filet mignon.

11:06.732 --> 11:07.667
Wow.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.769
If only I had the heart to buy that.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.773
$1,500 for filet mignon.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.977
That is a wonderful cut of meat.
But you know what?

11:18.044 --> 11:20.279
I'm just gonna stick with this beef heart.

11:20.346 --> 11:25.551
Confidence. I guess no one wants
Chef Esther's bacon-wrapped filet mignon.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.186
-Nick?
-Yeah?

11:27.253 --> 11:28.554
You may have a heart there,

11:28.621 --> 11:31.924
but you got some big other things
for not getting the filet mignons.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.093
-Well, I'm just going with it.
-Trust your skills.

11:34.160 --> 11:34.994
Yeah.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.263
I feel like if I nail the heart,

11:37.329 --> 11:41.901
and the fritter is okay,
then it can work and save my money.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.138
Home cooks,
you have 20 minutes left.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.973
Ryan, what're you doing
with that heavy cream?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.341
Creamed kale, my friend.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.778
Hence why I took-- 1,000 bucks on cream.

11:52.845 --> 11:55.948
This cream is the final component
that's really gonna tie my dish together.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.918
I'm gonna do some creamed kale,
finish it with Taleggio.

11:58.984 --> 12:02.188
I'm going to serve my steak
over a bed of creamed kale.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.324
I think this is an absolutely
perfect addition to the plate.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.762
Ooh, I like it.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.932
My mom and my grandma
are my two cooking influences,

12:12.998 --> 12:15.501
and my mom taught me
not to waste anything,

12:15.568 --> 12:18.104
and make something
out of whatever you have in your fridge.

12:18.170 --> 12:21.607
So I'm gonna use this onion jam
to put in my coleslaw.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.242
This is gonna be worth every penny.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.478
-Vivian.
-Hello.

12:25.544 --> 12:28.214
So I noticed that you were intentional
with getting the Save Box.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.985
I wanted simple ingredients,
and I trust my abilities to elevate them.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.019
-Okay, I love that.
-Yep.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.789
What're you gonna do
with the onion jam and the potatoes?

12:36.856 --> 12:38.824
Because that's things
you decided to spend on.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.760
I am going to be making

12:40.826 --> 12:42.528
a Gouda-stuffed fried meatball--

12:42.595 --> 12:43.729
-Ooh!
-…with coleslaw.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.465
And then I've put the onion jam
as part of the dressing.

12:46.532 --> 12:47.366
Oh, nice.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.802
I'm using the potato
to make a potato purée.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.371
Okay. And what do you think
your biggest challenge is right now?

12:52.438 --> 12:53.706
My biggest challenge is time.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.474
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.843
You have five minutes left, cooks!

12:59.211 --> 13:01.981
I think this dish
is pretty much 100% risk.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.985
I didn't win anything in the auction.
I got a whole beef heart in my box,

13:06.051 --> 13:08.487
but I mean, it's delicious.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.790
That tastes like a great steak.

13:12.925 --> 13:16.428
You overcook rib eye, you're done.
It's getting a little high actually.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.631
If I don't cook this steak perfectly,
I'm going to lose.

13:18.697 --> 13:19.999
All right, moment of truth.

13:20.065 --> 13:23.569
Because I have the best ingredients,
so I absolutely have to nail the rib eye.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.939
Remember, home cooks, you need
to place your dishes on the line

13:27.006 --> 13:29.575
then hit your buzzer before time runs out.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.379
I'm really racing against the clock,
but I'm a marathon runner,

13:33.445 --> 13:35.614
and my training prepared me
for this moment.

13:35.681 --> 13:39.151
I need to stay focused, calm,
and put out a good dish.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.420
We got ten seconds.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.089
-Eight, seven…

13:44.156 --> 13:46.892
-…six, five, four…

13:46.959 --> 13:50.162
-…three, two…

13:50.229 --> 13:52.198
One. Whoo!

13:52.264 --> 13:56.135
Good job, home cooks! Good job. Wow.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.873
And now we're sending
these plates back to Chef Choi.

14:00.940 --> 14:05.077
Impressing Chef Choi matters to me
because she's a professional,

14:05.144 --> 14:06.779
and she's very good at her craft.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.281
I feel I did the ingredients
in the Spend Box justice,

14:09.348 --> 14:11.150
but we'll see and let the judge decide.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.456
-Esther! What's up, Chef?
-Hi, Jordan.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.091
-How are you?
-I'm hungry.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.259
-You're hungry?
-Yeah.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.228
All right, Chef, so first up,

14:22.728 --> 14:25.364
we have a dry-aged rib eye steak

14:25.431 --> 14:26.899
with creamed kale,

14:26.966 --> 14:28.000
sautéed peppers,

14:28.067 --> 14:30.236
topped with an arugula salad.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.173
Nice rib eye.

14:36.175 --> 14:39.645
I'd say the cook on the steak
should be a little bit better.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.882
I have some pieces
that are very overcooked.

14:42.948 --> 14:46.418
The rib eye is the star.
It should be cooked perfectly.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.220
The creamed kale, I like.

14:48.287 --> 14:49.588
There was Taleggio,

14:49.655 --> 14:52.558
and it has that creaminess
that works really well with the steak.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.628
So I thought the heavy cream
was a really great buy.

14:55.694 --> 14:59.164
It really brought this dish to life.
But this is a Spend Box.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.333
There are so many great ingredients
to work with,

15:01.400 --> 15:04.637
and it just kind of seems
like a mediocre dish.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.375
-All right. Chef Choi, for the next one.
-Okay.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.442
All right.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.313
So, here you have
smoked Gouda-stuffed meatballs

15:14.380 --> 15:17.983
with a potato purée and a cabbage slaw.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.793
I love the idea of stuffing
the meatballs with the cheese,

15:27.860 --> 15:30.329
and of course, potatoes and a nice slaw.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.331
I like the idea behind the dish.

15:32.398 --> 15:35.134
Unfortunately, it was lacking in flavor.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.736
For me, I'm always looking
for balance in a dish.

15:37.803 --> 15:41.273
The acid was lacking,
a little bit more salt, and also texture.

15:41.340 --> 15:45.077
So this cook purchased
the potatoes and the onion jam.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.512
-And the onion jam?
-Yeah.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.113
Do you detect onion jam anywhere?

15:48.180 --> 15:51.250
Perhaps the cook needed
to use a little bit more of it.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.285
It's a Save Box, right?

15:53.352 --> 15:56.822
So I really wanna see
the ingredients transform.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.924
Ground beef doesn't have to be boring.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.127
All right, Chef.
So I'll take that one away.

16:02.194 --> 16:03.462
And now for this one,

16:03.996 --> 16:07.633
we have vermouth-marinated
and grilled beef heart,

16:07.700 --> 16:11.537
with blue cheese fritters
and a rapini stir-fry.

16:17.743 --> 16:20.279
I'm very happy with this.

16:21.113 --> 16:25.117
-Really?
-Yes, the cook on the beef heart, great.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.454
And it really soaked in
a lot of that flavor from the marinade.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.124
The greens, delicious,
and the fritters, mmm, nice touch.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.592
And also good use of the cheese.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.428
-But I would've liked a nice sauce on it.
-Yep.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.397
This cook tried to buy the heavy cream.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.899
You think that would that have helped
take this over the edge?

16:40.966 --> 16:43.502
Oh! The beef heart
with a nice creamy sauce

16:43.569 --> 16:45.437
would have been super nice in this.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.539
So this cook didn't go
for the filet mignon,

16:47.606 --> 16:49.675
but, you know,
this really worked out well.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.379
There's some hits and some misses,

16:53.445 --> 16:55.547
but I'm overall impressed
by the home cooks.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.549
-Do we have a winner?
-We do.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.491
Home cooks, it's result time.

17:06.392 --> 17:10.362
The home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

17:14.666 --> 17:17.102
-Nick.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.771
-Whoo-hoo!

17:18.837 --> 17:19.838
Well done.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.208
It feels good to get a W,

17:23.275 --> 17:25.644
and I still got
a lot of cash on the board,

17:25.711 --> 17:28.313
and if I win, hey,
that's more money to take home.

17:29.648 --> 17:33.552
Now it's time for your final challenge,
inspired by our guest chef, Esther Choi.

17:34.353 --> 17:37.990
Because Chef Choi owns some of the finest
Korean-American restaurants in New York,

17:38.057 --> 17:41.960
she's prepping ingredients
to help you make your tastiest Asian eats.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.130
Chef Choi, send out those boxes.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.407
Home cooks, in this round,
the boxes have set prices.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.745
The Spend Box is gonna run you $8,000.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.714
The Save Box will cost you $4,000,

18:02.781 --> 18:05.918
while the price
of the Surprise Box is $6,000.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.456
Nick, since you won the first round,
you've won a special advantage,

18:10.522 --> 18:14.393
which gives you the power
to assign each box…

18:14.460 --> 18:16.762
-…price tags included.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.530
-Wow.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.999
Okay, Nick, which box
would you like to buy?

18:21.767 --> 18:22.701
Um…

18:25.904 --> 18:27.706
I'm gonna choose the Save Box.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.441
I tend to be a cheap cook.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.910
I like to start
with very basic ingredients

18:31.977 --> 18:34.980
and then try to elevate them.
Just keep it really simple.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.648
I think that makes for good food.

18:37.149 --> 18:40.252
Nick, you bought the Save Box.
That will cost you $4,000.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.789
Who would you like
to assign the Spend Box to?

18:45.257 --> 18:46.258
Oh…

18:46.325 --> 18:48.861
My strategy
is basically a coin flip.

18:48.927 --> 18:52.865
I got the box I wanted. I could care less
what they are doing in their world.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.601
I'm gonna give, uh, Vivian the Spend.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.171
Vivian, that'll cost you $8,000.

19:00.038 --> 19:04.143
Ryan, that means you get
the Surprise Box at a cost of $6,000.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.679
I don't really care which box I get
because improvising in the kitchen

19:07.746 --> 19:09.448
is something
that I'm very comfortable with.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.551
The home cook
with the best Asian-inspired dish

19:12.618 --> 19:15.420
will walk away
with all the cash left in their bank.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.657
I'm very comfortable
with Korean flavors,

19:18.724 --> 19:21.760
and it's the final round that matters,
and we're cooking Asian food.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.263
There's 45 minutes on the clock.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.332
It's now time to cook at all costs!

19:35.274 --> 19:36.708
Bitter melon.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.310
I open my Surprise Box,

19:38.377 --> 19:41.013
and there's nothing in this box
I'm really unfamiliar with.

19:41.079 --> 19:44.116
Chinese-style sausage, coconut shrimp.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.618
The frozen coconut shrimp
are throwing me a little bit.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.687
I'm not sure
what I'm going to do with them,

19:48.754 --> 19:50.789
but I'm still fairly confident

19:50.856 --> 19:53.492
that I'll be able to make
a great dish out of what's in the box.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.628
Ooh, bok choy.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.531
The Spend Box is stacked
with awesome ingredients.

19:59.598 --> 20:00.933
A pork loin.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.601
Pork loin, tiger shrimp…

20:02.668 --> 20:04.536
Ginger, garlic.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.005
But they're not something
that I'm used to cooking with.

20:07.072 --> 20:10.108
It's curated towards
Chinese or Thai cuisine.

20:10.175 --> 20:13.912
I am a little stumped.

20:13.979 --> 20:17.749
I was really hoping to see some gochujang,
some Korean flavors in there.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.485
I have no idea what I'm making,

20:20.552 --> 20:23.388
but I'm just going to start
by searing off the pork loin.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.392
Canned ham. Okay, gotcha.

20:27.459 --> 20:31.363
When I open the Save Box, the first thing
that sticks out is canned ham.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.031
So I don't know.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.000
I'll figure it out.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.403
I'm definitely up
for thinking outside the box.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.405
Edamame, great.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.841
I love just experimenting
with what's in front of me.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.410
I'm always trying to come up
with fun stuff for my kids to eat.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.981
A whole ring of cooked shrimp.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.682
But I have a shrimp ring.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.452
How do you open this silly thing?

20:53.518 --> 20:56.888
I don't know what I'm doing right now.
Ah, I just… I don't know.

20:58.490 --> 21:02.094
Okay, so it's shrimp three ways.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.097
The party favorite in the Save Box
with a whole shrimp ring,

21:05.163 --> 21:06.965
tiger shrimp in the Spend Box,

21:07.032 --> 21:10.602
and frozen coconut shrimp
in the Surprise Box.

21:10.669 --> 21:11.837
I like it.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.474
There's a dish that's coming to my head
called pakbet,

21:15.540 --> 21:18.744
which is a Filipino braised vegetable dish
with shrimp.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.246
I have no other option
because the ingredients

21:21.313 --> 21:22.547
are just pushing me in that way,

21:22.614 --> 21:24.383
so I'm gonna see if I can make it work.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.920
I'm missing the South Korean flavors
I'm used to cooking with,

21:28.987 --> 21:33.191
so I just hope that something else
that I can use comes down the line.

21:37.996 --> 21:40.399
Home cooks,
it's time for another auction.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.169
Here we have three Asian-inspired kits,

21:44.236 --> 21:45.570
a dim sum kit,

21:46.204 --> 21:48.206
a sushi kit, and a soup kit.

21:48.874 --> 21:52.311
Vivian and Nick should be very scared
going into this auction.

21:52.377 --> 21:56.948
I have $14,500, and frankly,
I'm ready to pay whatever I need to

21:57.015 --> 21:58.483
to make sure I win this challenge.

21:59.184 --> 22:00.786
Okay, let's start with the dim sum kit.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.590
In this one, you have cilantro,
dumpling wrappers, and sweet Thai chili.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.259
It's got sweet, it's got heat,

22:07.326 --> 22:10.028
and all the essentials
to make perfect dumplings.

22:10.095 --> 22:12.998
Once a year, it's tradition
for my mom and I to make mandu,

22:13.065 --> 22:14.466
which is similar to a dumpling.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.702
So immediately,
I'm drawn to the dim sum kit.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.438
We're gonna start the bidding $1,000.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.574
-Vivian, $1,000. Do I have $1,200?

22:22.641 --> 22:24.509
-I'll do 12.
-$1,200 going to Nick.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.778
-$1,400 going to Vivian.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.247
Going once, going twice…

22:29.815 --> 22:32.784
Sold to Vivian for $1,400.
There you go. Good job.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.855
Not today, Nick. I have a vision,
and I need this dim sum kit.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.490
Next up is the sushi kit.

22:38.557 --> 22:42.627
Nori, sushi rice,
rice wine vinegar, soy, and wasabi.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.363
I am in on the sushi kit.

22:44.429 --> 22:48.233
I could do a shrimp sushi.
I could do a ham sushi.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.536
I see soy sauce,
and I know it's got to be mine.

22:51.603 --> 22:54.606
It's very hard to cook
any kind of Asian food

22:54.673 --> 22:57.743
without some form
of umami, salt-based sauce.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.445
The opening bid for this kit is $1,000.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.848
-Oh, there you go. $1,000 to Nick.
-I'll do that.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.484
-Oh! $1,100 going to Ryan.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.619
Do I hear 12? $1,200 for the sushi kit.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.187
-Do I have 1,300?

23:09.254 --> 23:12.324
-Do I have $1,500?
-Ryan, why-- why are you doing this to us?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.925
-$1,500 for sushi.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.594
-I'll do $2,000.
-$2,000 for Nick.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.864
-22.
-$2,200 for Ryan.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.199
It's game on in this kitchen right now.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.201
I'm in a bidding war. Great.

23:23.268 --> 23:26.171
$2,500 going to Nick. Do I have 3,000?

23:26.238 --> 23:29.541
-$3,000 for a sushi kit!

23:29.608 --> 23:32.577
It's just too much money. It's just--

23:32.644 --> 23:34.780
I just can't. I just can't do it.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.816
-Sold! $3,000 to Ryan.
-Go, go!

23:39.584 --> 23:42.087
All right, final kit. Soup kit.

23:42.154 --> 23:45.223
Thai basil, mung beans,
vermicelli, and broth.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.725
Do I hear $1,000?

23:47.292 --> 23:50.896
-You want this one too, Ryan?

23:50.962 --> 23:53.031
$1,000 going to Nick.

23:53.098 --> 23:57.402
$1,000 going once. $1,000 going twice…

23:57.469 --> 24:01.006
Sold to Nick. Soup kit, $1,000.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.142
It's getting spicy.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.111
Delicious. Okay.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.948
I feel great about getting
my soup kit for $1,000.

24:10.582 --> 24:14.686
Oh, you know what I could do?
Yeah, I can do this as like a noodle soup.

24:14.753 --> 24:17.789
I finally start to piece together
what I'm doing.

24:17.856 --> 24:20.492
I know I'm going to make a soup
with this mushroom broth.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.961
It's really savory,
it has a nice depth to it,

24:23.028 --> 24:25.931
and then I can combine
my shrimp and my ham

24:25.997 --> 24:29.534
into like a dumpling meatball
that I can poach in the soup.

24:29.601 --> 24:32.304
All of a sudden,
the whole dish is just like-- I get it.

24:32.871 --> 24:36.208
Home cooks, after those auctions,
you have 35 minutes left.

24:38.076 --> 24:41.847
For $1,400 in this dim sum kit,
I got dumpling wrappers.

24:42.414 --> 24:47.018
So I'm making pork fat-fried dumplings
with kimchi, pork, and bok choy.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.587
Kimchi.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.222
I take a lot of pride in my dumplings,

24:50.288 --> 24:52.991
because I make them
with my grandma every year,

24:53.058 --> 24:54.759
and I really want to do her proud.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.865
-Yo, it's getting good.
-Ah!

24:59.931 --> 25:02.901
Everything out there from the kits
to what came in the boxes…

25:02.968 --> 25:05.136
-Did I do a good job?
-You did. You did such a good job.

25:05.203 --> 25:08.106
I saw the Save Box
has canned ham in there.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.508
You know, that's my jam.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.610
It gives so much umami
to, like, every dish.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.878
-Yeah.
-Like, that salty bite.

25:12.944 --> 25:13.979
I love it in every way.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.381
So what do you think makes
a good Asian dish for a home cook?

25:16.448 --> 25:18.216
-Really, it's about balance, right?
-Yeah.

25:18.283 --> 25:21.086
You want that salty, you want the sweet,
you want the acidic.

25:21.152 --> 25:24.222
-That's what I'm always looking for.
-Okay. So I see some chili?

25:24.289 --> 25:28.760
This is my special chili soil.
So soil, meaning "sauce and oil."

25:28.827 --> 25:29.861
What is it?

25:29.928 --> 25:33.765
Shallots, garlic, soy sauce,
sesame oil, fresh ginger.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.800
You want to taste?
Try to get some of the chunks.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.737
You can use it as a finishing oil,
dip dumplings in it.

25:38.803 --> 25:39.938
Fire, right?

25:40.005 --> 25:43.942
It's so delicious how that grated ginger
peeks through on the aromatics,

25:44.009 --> 25:47.178
but really it's-- it's just
that unique combination of ingredients.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.114
So I'm-- Are you sending
that out as an upgrade?

25:49.180 --> 25:51.449
-Of course. Yeah, yeah.
-That's a great upgrade.

25:51.516 --> 25:52.684
Right, Chef, thank you.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.523
-Vivian, what'd they give you?
-Pork. Could be worse.

25:58.590 --> 26:02.294
I don't know what Ryan's working with
over there. Hope it's hard.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.996
At this point,
I'm sautéing the vegetables.

26:05.063 --> 26:09.167
I have my shrimp ready to go in the fryer.
I'm seeing my dish come together,

26:09.234 --> 26:12.470
but I need something
just to sort of punch up the flavor.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.345
The line is flashing and moving.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.582
That means
we got another surprise for you.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.153
We have homemade chili soil,

26:28.219 --> 26:32.324
which is chili oil and sauce
prepared by Chef Choi.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.392
It can act as a flavor enhancer,

26:34.459 --> 26:37.262
as your main flavor driver,
as a sauce, as a dip.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.798
This is the perfect thing
to tie my shrimp together.

26:39.864 --> 26:43.568
Some spice in my soup
would be really awesome.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.003
Do I have $1,000?

26:45.070 --> 26:46.471
-Flavor driver, there it is.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.139
-Nick $1,000. One thou–

26:48.206 --> 26:49.040
Oh, there you go.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.343
-I have 12. I have 13, 14.

26:51.409 --> 26:55.780
Do I have 1,500? 15.
1,500 to Ryan for the chi– Oh, 1,700.

26:55.847 --> 27:00.352
Do I have 2,000? 2,000 to Ryan.
$2,000 for the chili soil going once.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.954
$2,000 going twice…

27:03.855 --> 27:05.390
-Sold to Ryan!

27:05.457 --> 27:08.493
$2,000 for the chili soil
prepared by Chef Esther.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.394
That's worth it.

27:12.364 --> 27:16.234
Now that I have this beautiful chili soil,
I'll add it to my shrimp glaze,

27:16.301 --> 27:18.937
and I'm also gonna add
a little bit to my stir-fry.

27:19.004 --> 27:19.971
Oh, that's fire.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.341
-How much time do we have left?
-Five minutes!

27:23.408 --> 27:27.479
There's not that much time left,
and I still haven't fried my dumplings,

27:27.545 --> 27:30.715
and I wanna make sure that my dumplings
are as flavorful as possible,

27:30.782 --> 27:32.450
so I fry them in pork fat.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.154
My goal with this dish is to show

27:36.221 --> 27:39.024
that you can use really simple ingredients

27:39.090 --> 27:41.726
and make something super delicious.

27:41.793 --> 27:46.164
I think I elevated the hell
out of that shrimp ring and canned ham.

27:46.231 --> 27:47.165
Are you kidding me?

27:47.866 --> 27:49.901
One minute, home cooks. One minute.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.269
Oh, my God.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.771
-Come on.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.507
I'm struggling to make sure
I get everything on the plate,

27:55.573 --> 27:57.075
and it looks somewhat neat.

27:57.142 --> 28:00.145
Remember, you have to put your plate
on the line and then buzz your buzzers.

28:00.211 --> 28:02.580
My plate
might look a little bit bare,

28:02.647 --> 28:05.750
but I know that there's a lot of flavor
in these dumplings.

28:05.817 --> 28:11.556
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

28:11.623 --> 28:12.724
-five…

28:12.791 --> 28:13.758
-…four…

28:13.825 --> 28:16.928
-…three two, one.

28:16.995 --> 28:20.065
Dang!

28:22.100 --> 28:23.868
I spent $11,000 on my dish,

28:23.935 --> 28:26.471
but I went into this round
thinking money was no object

28:26.538 --> 28:28.206
because I wanted to win.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.479
What up, Chef? Really excited for this.

28:34.546 --> 28:38.249
Here are the three Asian-inspired dishes
that our home cooks made.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.618
-It looks really good, Jordan.
-Doesn't it? All right, Chef.

28:40.685 --> 28:43.021
First up, we have coconut shrimp

28:43.088 --> 28:47.358
with stir-fried vegetables, steamed rice,
and your chili soil.

28:52.363 --> 28:56.034
I'm really digging this.
There's sweetness, there's some heat.

28:56.101 --> 28:59.370
Textures work really well.
The vegetables are cooked properly.

28:59.437 --> 29:02.140
The coconut shrimp, super crispy.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.609
And the chili soil? I'm biased.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.778
-But that makes it so much better.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.980
Like, the whole dish.
So I think money well spent.

29:09.047 --> 29:13.118
So this cook spent $3,000
on the sushi kit.

29:13.184 --> 29:16.121
I think it was really smart, you know?
If you're going to make a stir-fry,

29:16.187 --> 29:17.856
you get the soy sauce,

29:17.922 --> 29:21.126
but I think one thing
I didn't want to see is a big stir-fry

29:21.192 --> 29:23.394
with every ingredient used. It's a lot.

29:23.461 --> 29:27.232
I'm big on "less is more,"
and this could have used a little less.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.503
Okay, Chef. Now for the next home cook.

29:31.569 --> 29:32.804
Okay.

29:32.871 --> 29:38.109
These are pork fat-fried dumplings
stuffed with pork, bok choy, and kimchi.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.645
I'm very particular with my dumplings.

29:44.249 --> 29:47.552
This home cook used pork fat
to crisp up the dumpling.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.021
I could really feel that and taste that.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.322
So it was cooked nicely.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.892
But then I bit into the dumpling,

29:53.958 --> 29:57.195
and I was kind of waiting
for that moment of umami.

29:57.262 --> 30:00.031
-Like the "Mmm, dumpling!"
Yeah.

30:00.098 --> 30:02.333
-That moment didn't happen here.
-Really?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.335
Yes. Also, no sauce.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.805
-It's a dumpling. You gotta--
-Yeah. Gotta have a sauce, right?

30:06.871 --> 30:10.875
So this was a Spend Box.
High-end, luxurious ingredients.

30:10.942 --> 30:15.146
For a dumpling, it's perfect,
but just overall fell really short.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.650
-All right, Chef, last one.
-Okay.

30:19.517 --> 30:20.518
So this right there

30:21.119 --> 30:23.221
is a pork and shrimp dumpling

30:23.288 --> 30:25.223
with vermicelli in a mushroom broth.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.197
I really like the dish.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.131
Okay.

30:33.198 --> 30:37.101
Nice and fresh, light.
The broth clean, not salty.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.038
This is, you know,
the very humble Save Box.

30:40.104 --> 30:42.207
You know, humble ingredients, to me,

30:42.273 --> 30:45.510
you can really be creative with them,
and I feel like they did that here.

30:45.577 --> 30:49.214
You taste some of that umami
from the canned ham,

30:49.280 --> 30:52.083
and then texture from the shrimp.
That's what I was looking for.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.818
-Mm-hmm.
-Now, texture of the noodles.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.653
Needed to be cooked a little bit more.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.388
-A little bit too al dente.
-Yeah.

30:57.455 --> 31:00.058
But overall, I thought
it was a really creative dish.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.929
All right, Chef,
do we know which home cook

31:04.996 --> 31:07.465
we're sending home
with all the money in their bank?

31:08.066 --> 31:08.900
Yes.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.205
This is it.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.076
It's time to find out
who won the competition

31:18.142 --> 31:20.945
and all the cash left in their bank.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.514
But first, let me introduce you

31:23.581 --> 31:26.484
to our guest chef and judge,
Chef Esther Choi.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.087
Whoo!

31:32.090 --> 31:34.192
Okay, let's get to the results.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.097
Who made the pork fat-fried dumplings?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.166
Your dumplings were well-constructed,

31:42.233 --> 31:44.369
and I really like
that you fried them in pork fat,

31:44.435 --> 31:45.870
but I think more could have been done

31:45.937 --> 31:48.439
with the expensive ingredients
in the Spend Box.

31:49.207 --> 31:52.644
And who made the vermicelli soup
with the pork and shrimp dumplings?

31:53.478 --> 31:56.014
Nick, you really showed
a lot of creativity

31:56.080 --> 31:59.584
transforming the ingredients
in your Save Box into something delicious,

31:59.651 --> 32:02.854
but your vermicelli was a tad undercooked.

32:03.554 --> 32:06.724
So that means Ryan,
you made the coconut shrimp stir-fry.

32:06.791 --> 32:07.692
Correct.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.994
Your rice and vegetables
were really well cooked,

32:10.061 --> 32:11.796
and the flavors were really well-balanced,

32:11.863 --> 32:14.198
but there was
a little too much on the plate.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.635
Home cooks, it's time to find out

32:17.702 --> 32:20.505
who's going home
with all the money left in their bank.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.908
Ryan, you have $9,500 left,

32:23.975 --> 32:27.812
Vivian you have $10,999 left,

32:28.313 --> 32:34.852
and Nick you have the largest amount
with $17,490 remaining in your bank.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.624
The home cook with the best dish is…

32:44.295 --> 32:46.130
-Nick.

32:48.833 --> 32:49.701
-Whoo!
-Congrats.

32:50.368 --> 32:54.339
Congratulations. You've won $17,490.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.907
-I'll take it.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.443
Nick, I really love
that you took humble ingredients

32:58.509 --> 32:59.510
and made them shine.

32:59.577 --> 33:00.578
Thank you so much.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.280
That's-- That means a lot.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.682
It was so awesome
to hear a professional like that

33:04.749 --> 33:06.851
talk about something
I made out of a shrimp ring.

33:06.918 --> 33:07.919
It was wonderful.

33:08.453 --> 33:11.155
Nick! You proved
you can cook at all costs.

33:12.523 --> 33:17.261
I put my best foot forward. Win or lose,
I know Grandma's proud, no matter what.

33:18.062 --> 33:21.733
I'm bummed, but I had a great time today,
and Nick did a great job.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.902
Biggest takeaway? Cook at home.
Make some good food.

33:24.969 --> 33:27.138
Doesn't have to be expensive.
Get in the kitchen!
