00:03.125 --> 00:04.333
You're not gonna believe it.

00:05.125 --> 00:08.041
Duke Evans is coming to the mall
this weekend!

00:08.125 --> 00:12.208
Get out! Duke Evans is coming here?

00:12.250 --> 00:14.333
To our mall? That is incred--

00:14.417 --> 00:17.166
- You have no idea who he is, do you?
- Not a clue.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.959
Duke Evans is a world champion
speed board-breaker.

00:21.041 --> 00:21.959
Check it out.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.375
<i>Welcome to the chop shop, baby!</i>

00:29.625 --> 00:30.667
Wow.

00:31.291 --> 00:35.458
Duke Evans is a loser who travels around
in a motor home doing karate demos.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.041
He's having a board-breaking challenge
to see if anybody can break his record.

00:39.917 --> 00:42.083
I'd love to break that guy's record,

00:42.166 --> 00:44.709
watch him soak up his tears
with his own mullet.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.542
I don't know, Jack.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.125
You think you're ready
to take on a guy like the Duke?

00:51.208 --> 00:52.875
Yeah, I kind of do.

01:03.542 --> 01:04.917
Uh, dude?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.083
You know you came to school
in your pajamas, right?

01:07.166 --> 01:10.417
Oh, yeah, I know.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.625
I’ve got family in town

01:11.709 --> 01:14.000
and I have to share my bed
with my cousin Pepito.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.291
Pepito!

01:19.500 --> 01:21.417
So you're gonna go to class like that?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.542
Pssh, class? No, no, no.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.250
I’m going to bed.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.333
I can't believe he's really going to bed--

- That was awesome!

02:29.667 --> 02:32.542
Oh, thanks, Eddie.
See, it's all about technique and focus.

02:32.625 --> 02:33.875
I do this whole meditation thing before--

02:33.959 --> 02:35.500
He was talking about me.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.417
I’ll see you guys later.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.375
Well, have fun.

02:41.333 --> 02:44.625
Aren't you gonna say
anything about my outfit?

02:44.709 --> 02:45.542
- What outfit?
- Nope.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.375
- Didn't notice.
- You look the same to me.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.625
I’m a candy-striper, you freaks.

02:50.709 --> 02:52.250
I’m volunteering at the hospital.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.208
And what exactly does a candy-striper do?

02:57.125 --> 02:59.542
I cheer up the patients,
bring them flowers

02:59.625 --> 03:02.709
and do everything I can
to ignore what's in their bedpans.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.083
Okay, let's get back to work, Jerry.

03:06.166 --> 03:08.125
I really wanna break that jerk's record.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.875
Dude, what do you have against Duke?

03:10.959 --> 03:12.875
He's got the hair of a god.

03:13.959 --> 03:16.375
He was my hero until I met him.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.041
That'll be five bucks, scooter.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.959
You got yourself a real Duke board.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.500
Thanks, Duke. You know what--
I love karate!

03:24.583 --> 03:28.417
You? You'll never be good at karate.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.709
You're not built for it.

03:31.834 --> 03:35.083
You might wanna learn how
to twirl a baton,

03:35.166 --> 03:37.417
put on one of them glitter getups.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.709
You'll be awesome.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.583
-
Next.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.709
That guy is a jerk, but he's right.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.166
I think you could rock
one of them glitter getups.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.417
Could we get back to work?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.333
Aw, dude, I’m fried.

03:53.417 --> 03:55.083
Can we take a break?

03:55.166 --> 03:56.750
Your cousin still in town?

03:56.834 --> 03:58.500
Yeah, and get this,

03:58.583 --> 04:01.166
last night Pepito pe-peed the bed.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.417
Let's just break a few more boards.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.667
I really wanna beat this guy.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.834
- Fine.
- Come on.

04:07.917 --> 04:08.834
You ready?

04:08.917 --> 04:10.333
Yeah.
- All right.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.834
- Ready.
- Go.

04:14.834 --> 04:18.000
- Oh!
- Jerry, I’m so sorry.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.375
- I thought you were ready.
- He's all right.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.166
He's just a little groggy.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.750
Jerry!

04:24.125 --> 04:25.375
- It's Milton.
- Aah!

04:25.458 --> 04:28.208
Stop slapping him.
We gotta get him to a hospital.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.625
- A hospital.
- You're right.

04:29.709 --> 04:31.959
Come on, come on.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.583
All right, come on. Go.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.959
And don't worry, Jerry.
You're in good hands.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.291
- Aw, Jerry.
- Oh, my goodness.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.125
I’m here at Falafel Phil's

04:42.208 --> 04:45.458
where Phil is about to sell
his one millionth falafel ball.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.458
That's right! That's right!

04:47.542 --> 04:50.834
And some lucky random customer

04:50.917 --> 04:53.792
is going to win free food for life.

04:53.875 --> 04:57.166
I wonder who is this random lucky person

04:57.250 --> 04:58.208
going to be.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.250
I don't know. I’m not sure.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.333
I don't even have an idea clue.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.583
Listen, sister woman,

05:05.667 --> 05:08.250
get your <i>hockmock</i> in line now.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.458
But if they find out
that I am your sister,

05:10.542 --> 05:13.333
I will have shaved
my mustache for nothing.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.917
No one is going to find out.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.750
Now stop having pancake attack.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.750
I get publicity
and don't have to give away free food.

05:26.917 --> 05:27.875
Excuse me.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.291
Hey, Phil, I’m not that hungry.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.208
Can I just have one falafel ball, please?

05:31.291 --> 05:33.291
- One falafel ball coming--
-

05:33.417 --> 05:35.834
-
- Oh, oh, dung of camel.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.875
Stop dancing!

05:45.583 --> 05:46.959
Wow!

05:47.041 --> 05:49.792
This man just bought
the winning falafel ball.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.917
- What's your name, sir?
- Rudy.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.000
What's going on?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.667
What's going on, Rudy,

05:56.750 --> 05:59.375
is you just won free food for life.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.834
How does it feel?

06:02.917 --> 06:05.375
You hear that, Ma?
We're eating good tonight.

06:05.458 --> 06:07.166
Eating good, I tell you!

06:10.041 --> 06:12.291
Phil, would you like to say anything?

06:12.417 --> 06:13.458
Huh?

06:16.333 --> 06:20.000

06:23.917 --> 06:25.166

06:25.250 --> 06:30.041
I pushed him too hard just so I could
what, break Duke's record?

06:30.125 --> 06:32.208
He's in the hospital because of me.

06:33.625 --> 06:34.542
Doctor.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.000
Could you tell us how he's doing?

06:37.083 --> 06:39.208
uh, yes, but let me see

06:39.291 --> 06:41.083
if I can put it in terms
you would understand.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.792
He has a boo-boo on his tum-tum

06:44.875 --> 06:48.166
and so we had to order
some insidey pictures.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.834
You mean you're taking an X-ray
to check for a bilateral contusion

06:51.917 --> 06:53.333
along his external fractoid?

06:53.959 --> 06:56.458
Well, thank you, Dr. Wannabe.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.959
Well, you're welcome, Dr. Talk-down-to-me.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.208
That's it, I’m done.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.125
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.542
- Finally.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.458
Just opened up some prime real estate.

No, Rudy, I am cutting you off.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.583
You can't cut me off.

07:24.667 --> 07:27.000
It was on the news. Everyone saw it.

07:27.083 --> 07:30.583
Okay, Rudy, you win,
but there will come a day

07:30.667 --> 07:34.041
sometime in the future
when you're going to regret

07:34.125 --> 07:37.542
ever trying to take
advantage of Falafel Phil.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.834
Well, until that day comes,

07:41.917 --> 07:43.625

08:05.333 --> 08:06.417
Oh, yeah.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.917
Well, the doctor will be in in a minute.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.083
I’ve gotta go deliver pudding

08:09.166 --> 08:10.917
and show the patients how
to use their beds.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Oh, I’ve heard about hospital pudding.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.917
But wait, how do people
not know how to use a bed?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.333
These hospital beds are amazing.

08:18.417 --> 08:20.250
They have 15 different comfort settings

08:20.333 --> 08:23.125
and a massage mode.
I’ll check in on you later.

08:25.625 --> 08:27.125
Pudding?

08:27.208 --> 08:30.583
A bed with 15 comfort settings
that's Pepito-less?

08:32.917 --> 08:35.375
Sorry I’m late, but I just lost a patient.

08:36.417 --> 08:39.792
Oh, I’m so sorry. How'd he die?

08:39.875 --> 08:42.542
No, he didn't die.
I wheeled him onto an elevator,

08:42.625 --> 08:43.792
bent over to pick up a penny,

08:43.875 --> 08:46.208
and when I stood up again, gone.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.542
The patient, not the penny.
I still have the penny.

08:52.542 --> 08:56.542
Anyway, got your x-rays here.

08:56.625 --> 08:59.250
Good news, no breaks, no fractures.
You are good to go home.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.083
Wait, I-- I have to leave?

09:03.542 --> 09:05.291
Well, there's nothing
wrong with you, Jerry.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.625

Fine, don't break your boards,

09:41.875 --> 09:43.417
but you can't tell Jerry.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.959

11:52.625 --> 11:54.166
You were trying to kill me.

11:55.041 --> 11:57.500
Rudy, you are as wrong as you are fat

11:57.583 --> 12:00.000
from stuffing
your falafel hole with free food.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.959
I’m not eating at your place ever again.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.125
In fact, from now on

12:04.208 --> 12:07.083
I’m having all my meals
at Captain Corndog's.

12:07.166 --> 12:08.583
Good, finally, I’ve--

12:08.667 --> 12:11.083
Captain Corndog?

12:11.917 --> 12:14.208
For that I will kill you!

12:14.375 --> 12:16.834
Prepare for the flying goat.

12:28.875 --> 12:29.959
Kim?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.125
Kim.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.750
Kim!

12:35.792 --> 12:37.667
What, Jerry? What?

12:39.417 --> 12:40.542
Where have you been?

12:41.500 --> 12:42.625
I know we're friends,

12:42.709 --> 12:46.041
but I’ve been in here
nine times in the last hour.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.917
I’ve got other patients that need help.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.250
Oh.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.166
Oh, I’m-- I’m sorry.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't mean to be any trouble. Aah.

12:56.458 --> 12:58.375
I just thought in my hour of need

12:58.458 --> 13:01.291
you'd-- aah-- you'd be there for me.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.166
But no, no, I was wrong.

13:05.458 --> 13:06.709
I’ll get it myself.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.625
Fine!

13:15.875 --> 13:17.083
I’ll get your pudding.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.375
Thank you.

13:25.875 --> 13:29.000
Oh, my! Oh, yeah!

13:31.333 --> 13:33.000
I gotta go, little baby.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.667
One piece of advice,

13:35.750 --> 13:38.375
do not wear a bow tie
to the first day of preschool.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.166
It'll haunt you forever.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.500
Can we swap back now?

13:45.583 --> 13:47.458
This one's getting
that not-so-fresh smell.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.375
We already swapped.
You get that one from over there.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.083
Nuh-uh, that's mine.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.166
The one you're holding
you got from over there.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.375
What? Do you realize what we've done?

13:58.417 --> 14:00.542
We've mixed up all these babies

14:00.625 --> 14:02.667
and they've seen our faces.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.250
Hey, scooter,
coming to the board-breaking show tonight?

14:16.333 --> 14:18.792
My name's not scooter.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.375
It's Jack. And no, I’m not.

14:21.458 --> 14:22.792
Too bad.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.250
There's gonna be
a splinter shower, brother.

14:26.250 --> 14:29.375
I guess you'll just be one of the losers
that don't see it.

14:33.041 --> 14:34.917
I don't think you're all that, Duke.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.709
In fact, I wanted to come down here
and challenge your record,

14:37.792 --> 14:39.333
but my friend's in the hospital.

14:39.625 --> 14:43.375
"Friend in the hospital."

14:43.458 --> 14:44.959
Sure.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.375
A little wimp like you
couldn't break a board.

14:50.458 --> 14:53.208
I don't think you could break wind, Jack.

14:55.333 --> 14:56.333
Really?

15:03.041 --> 15:04.834
Those boards weren't for breaking.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.458
I was building a spice rack for my fan.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.583
Do you know how much trouble
we're going to be in

15:15.667 --> 15:17.166
for mixing up these babies?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.834
We're going to jail, man!

15:18.917 --> 15:20.458
I've gotta think.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.125
Shut up!

15:23.208 --> 15:25.875
Shut up, you dumb babies!

15:28.083 --> 15:30.125
What are you two doing in here?

15:30.208 --> 15:32.000
Uh, it's his fault.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.250
I told him not to come in here,

15:34.375 --> 15:36.208
but he just had to pick up the babies.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.750
It wasn't just me.
He was smelling their heads.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.291
I can't help it!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.959
Their heads smell so good.

15:44.875 --> 15:48.041
We tried putting them back,
but they all look the same.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.542
We've ruined their lives!

15:53.000 --> 15:54.500
I’m so sorry!

15:56.333 --> 15:59.000
We mix them up all the time.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.750
That's why we put
barcode bracelets on their ankles.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.041
Oh, so you mean

16:09.041 --> 16:09.875
They--

16:11.208 --> 16:13.500
- Okay then.
-

16:15.250 --> 16:16.542
Good day, babies.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.166
Oh, this is my song!

16:38.083 --> 16:39.542
Guys, you won't believe this.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.750
Jerry's been faking
his injury the entire time.

16:42.834 --> 16:43.917
What?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.834
Do you have any idea
what we've just been through?

16:47.417 --> 16:51.000
You? I got him 37 puddings.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.792
I clipped his nails.

16:53.875 --> 16:57.417
I washed his feet.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.375
- Time to scrub up.
- What?

17:02.458 --> 17:04.959
- I said scrub up.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.417
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

17:15.625 --> 17:17.166
Kim, what's going on?

17:17.250 --> 17:19.083
We got the test results back.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.875
It's not good. You need immediate surgery.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.875
What? Wait, why can't I move?

17:26.542 --> 17:27.959
We thought it would be best

17:28.041 --> 17:29.166
to strap you down.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.208
We ran out of anesthesia.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.959
- What are you-- no, no, no.
-

17:36.041 --> 17:38.166
No, no, no, no!

17:38.250 --> 17:40.709
Wait, no, no, stop!
I was faking the whole thing.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.041
- What?
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:43.875 --> 17:45.458
There's nothing wrong with me.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.709
I just wanted my own bed.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.458
Milton, Eddie?

17:52.625 --> 17:54.166
Hey, when did you guys become doctors?

17:57.500 --> 17:58.875
I don't believe this.

17:58.959 --> 18:00.542
I’ve been worried sick.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.333
I even bought you
this stupid talking bear.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.750
I <i>wuv</i> you very much.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.875
Oh, no, you don't.
He's not worth your <i>wuv.</i>

18:09.875 --> 18:11.500
Guys, I’m sorry.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.166
I don't know what I was thinking.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.625
I mean the food, my own bed,

18:15.709 --> 18:17.959
Kim's oh-so-refreshing footbaths.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.417
Ew! You gave him a footbath?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.625
Hey, I am not proud of it, okay?

18:25.041 --> 18:26.125
Let's just get out of here.

18:27.041 --> 18:27.959
Guys.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.542
Guys, guys!

18:31.792 --> 18:33.542
Could somebody untie me, please?

18:41.041 --> 18:42.750
Phil, Rudy?

18:43.375 --> 18:44.583
What happened to him?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.375
I went to Captain Corndog's

18:47.500 --> 18:50.709
and accidentally ordered
the millionth wiener.

18:51.875 --> 18:53.583
They gave me free food for life.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.417
I ate and I ate.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.458
And I ate and I ate.

18:58.542 --> 19:01.000
And I ate and then I blacked out.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.083
I found him wandering
around the courtyard,

19:04.166 --> 19:06.583
his shirt off, his pants unbuckled,

19:06.667 --> 19:08.709
and pieces of wiener all over his face.

19:10.542 --> 19:13.166
I have a problem.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.792
- Twenty-seven, twenty-eight!
-

19:18.875 --> 19:22.291
That's right. New record, yeah!

19:22.375 --> 19:26.250
Any of you panty-wearing punks
wanna step up and challenge my record?

19:27.417 --> 19:29.083
That's what I thought!

19:29.166 --> 19:31.542
Hey, Duke, I’ll give it a shot.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.000
Jack!

19:35.000 --> 19:36.500
I just need somebody to hold my boards.

19:37.667 --> 19:38.834
I’ll do it.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.125
Jack, I wanna make things right.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.375
Now let's break this fool's record.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.291
Okay, scooter.

19:49.417 --> 19:50.959
You ready on the clock?

19:51.667 --> 19:53.834
You gotta break 28 boards

19:53.917 --> 19:56.000
in 15 seconds.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.208
And go!

20:08.834 --> 20:10.875
- Twenty-nine boards. We did it!
Yes!

20:17.417 --> 20:20.000
You know what? You got lucky, Jack.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.750
But I’ll be back next year,

20:21.834 --> 20:23.417
and you'd better be ready.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.959
One of you sweet ladies wanna give Dukey
a ride to the bus station?

20:30.333 --> 20:31.333
Fine!

20:33.166 --> 20:34.959
Jerry, that was incredible.

20:35.041 --> 20:36.959
Man, I couldn't have done it without you.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.250
Whoo!

20:40.333 --> 20:42.875
Ah, dude, you gotta keep your gown closed.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.041
Everyone can see the ponies
on your underpants.

20:46.875 --> 20:50.083
They're not ponies. They're unicorns.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.333
-
- Hey, that's my bike!

20:53.375 --> 20:55.250
You snooze you lose, little lady.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.166
Duke!
- <i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:59.667 --> 21:02.709
You know what?
I was wrong about you, Phil.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.208
You're a good friend--

21:04.250 --> 21:07.250
A good weird friend.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.959
Okay, Rudy, get some rest.

21:11.041 --> 21:12.750
Let me help adjust your bed for you--

21:12.834 --> 21:14.625
- Oh!
- Ow!

21:15.417 --> 21:18.458
Okay, okay, this is awkward.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.583
Someone should really fix this bed.
