WEBVTT

00:17.785 --> 00:20.654
(loud buzzing,
grunting)

00:23.691 --> 00:25.826
(yells, groans)

00:25.859 --> 00:27.761
(grunting)

00:30.764 --> 00:32.700
(yelling)

00:36.104 --> 00:38.772
(buzzing, yelling)

00:39.840 --> 00:41.275
Help!

00:45.413 --> 00:47.615
(grunts)

00:50.851 --> 00:52.052
(grunting)

01:05.233 --> 01:07.801
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:07.835 --> 01:10.471
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:10.504 --> 01:12.806
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:12.840 --> 01:13.841
* How, how, how, how

01:13.874 --> 01:16.177
* Hey, hey

01:22.383 --> 01:24.218
* You gotta come on.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.458
Running out of
questions, Doc?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.693
No, just writing down notes.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.662
More notes
than questions lately.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.165
Must be making progress.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.667
Do yo think
you're making progress?

01:39.700 --> 01:42.736
Don't you? I've admitted
to going off-book,

01:42.770 --> 01:44.472
trying to make things right,

01:44.505 --> 01:46.607
both at mine
and my team's expense.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.544
Talked about my childhood,
fears, dreams, Mom, Dad and

01:50.578 --> 01:52.380
my divorce.
Are you in a rush

01:52.413 --> 01:54.648
to get rid of me,
Agent Pride?
No.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.650
But I am looking forward
to getting HQ off my back

01:56.684 --> 01:58.652
and moving on.
Well, look,

01:58.686 --> 02:01.689
as far as I'm concerned, you're
definitely making progress,

02:01.722 --> 02:02.923
okay?
Okay.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.758
In fact,
I've been impressed.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.394
You've been diligent
about meeting,

02:06.427 --> 02:07.661
answering questions,

02:07.695 --> 02:10.198
identifying areas to improve.
But?

02:10.231 --> 02:14.602
But I think HQ's gonna need
something a little more concrete

02:14.635 --> 02:15.836
before they feel more confident.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.272
Concrete. What does that mean?

02:18.306 --> 02:20.708
I don't know.
I can't answer that for you,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.376
but I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.712
See you next week.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.748
Oh, by the way,
speaking of your father,

02:27.781 --> 02:29.750
HQ got a call from Slidell?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.219
Apparently, the prison
board's been trying

02:31.252 --> 02:32.653
to get in touch
with you?
Yup.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.388
My dad's up for parole again.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.757
Been in prison a
long time, hasn't he?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.759
Are you gonna help
him get paroled?

02:38.792 --> 02:41.762
I wrote a letter last time,
and it didn't help.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.298
Might help if you showed up
in person next time.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.766
(phone beeps)

02:49.737 --> 02:51.605
Got a case.
Of course.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.246
(camera shutter clicking)

02:58.279 --> 02:59.913
Oh, brace yourselves.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.849
Here he comes.
I'm telling you, Percy,

03:01.882 --> 03:04.485
you're blowing this way out
of proportion, all right?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.787
King's gonna be fine.
Really? Pumping station

03:06.820 --> 03:08.356
right next to the levee

03:08.389 --> 03:09.890
Mayor Hamilton tried
to blow up last year,

03:09.923 --> 03:12.226
and a victim connected
to that whole mess?

03:12.260 --> 03:14.395
Last thing Pride needs
is another trigger.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.330
Morning. How's everybody?

03:16.364 --> 03:17.898
Good.
Great.
Never better.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.003
Good. What have we got?

03:23.036 --> 03:27.241
Well, Seabee was apparently
checking canal pumps last night,

03:27.275 --> 03:29.510
releasing the water,
slipped and fell in.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.412
Must have gotten
sucked under,

03:31.445 --> 03:33.447
then trapped against
the debris grates next

03:33.481 --> 03:34.715
to one of the pipes.
Who found him?

03:34.748 --> 03:35.583
SONJA:
Supervisor.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.418
Turned off the pumps
when he showed up

03:37.451 --> 03:39.753
for work this morning,
body floated up.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.255
WADE: Which would mean
he'd been dead at least

03:41.289 --> 03:42.756
eight hours before.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.825
Drowning victims usually
stay submerged

03:44.858 --> 03:47.261
until bacterial decomposition
of the tissue

03:47.295 --> 03:49.463
excretes gases,
makes 'em buoyant.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.465
Sounds like our sailor
never had a chance.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.867
You said he slipped?
Thinking it was an accident?

03:53.901 --> 03:56.704
Maybe, maybe not.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.306
He's got a three-inch gash
on his forearm.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.873
Can't tell
what caused it yet, but

03:59.907 --> 04:01.842
it could be consistent
with a defensive wound.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.278
LASALLE: And we found
bloodstains on the floodwall

04:04.312 --> 04:05.646
over by his tablet.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.681
Tell him who
the victim is.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.951
Seabee's name is Isaac Newell.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.821
Same Isaac Newell that worked
here before Clearwater.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.491
But that's impossible.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.493
Newell was convicted,
along with everyone else

04:19.527 --> 04:21.962
who helped Hamilton try
to flood Clearwater.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.631
He's supposed to be in prison.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.865
LASALLE:
Yeah, well,

04:24.898 --> 04:26.467
somehow he got released.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.268
And got his old
job back, too.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.405
GREGORIO:
He made a plea deal.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.375
I just got off the phone
with the U.S. Attorney's office.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.410
Said all charges
against Newell were dropped

04:36.444 --> 04:37.978
in exchange for a testimony

04:38.011 --> 04:40.314
against somebody higher up
on the Clearwater food chain.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.949
So, wait.
Newell got off scot-free?

04:41.982 --> 04:44.985
The man took bribes, he told
Hamilton's explosive experts

04:45.018 --> 04:46.820
exactly which levee to blow.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.956
Who's he testifying
against?
He wouldn't say.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.992
Said he didn't want
to compromise the case.
The case?!

04:52.025 --> 04:54.027
The case is closed!
I helped them close it!

04:54.061 --> 04:56.430
They must have reopened it
to go after somebody else,

04:56.464 --> 04:59.066
somebody obviously
worth cutting a deal for.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.501
Yeah, and somebody
who obviously

05:00.534 --> 05:02.736
has motive to kill Newell,
shut him up.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.338
Well, I should've been told
about this.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.874
I worked too damn hard
to put those people away.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.876
I'm gonna find out
what the hell is going on.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.077
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
I don't think

05:10.110 --> 05:11.645
you're gonna
have much luck.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.080
Soon as we heard,
we took the liberty

05:13.113 --> 05:15.949
of trying to do a workaround
DOJ's Clearwater files.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.352
All right, and what did
you find out?
PATTON: That's the thing.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.753
Nothing.
Which is unusual, 'cause

05:19.787 --> 05:22.055
DOJ isn't typically known
for having high levels

05:22.089 --> 05:23.957
of encryption,
but for some reason,

05:23.991 --> 05:25.626
the Clearwater case-- it's...
PATTON:
Untouchable.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.127
And that says a lot,
coming from me.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.796
Well, that doesn't make sense,
Patton.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.831
Look, King,

05:30.864 --> 05:33.033
we know how much you
went through on this case.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.703
All right? Especially
'cause of Hamilton and all.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.507
PRIDE: You're right,
Chris. You're right.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.375
But what I went through

05:41.409 --> 05:44.077
to bring Hamilton down
affected you, too. I know that.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.847
And I'm working hard to
rectify it, to move on

05:46.880 --> 05:48.916
so that we all can, so,

05:48.949 --> 05:51.118
let's just try to treat this
like any other case,

05:51.151 --> 05:52.853
investigate
Seabee Newell's death.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.656
If it leads us to
Clearwater, so be it,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.625
but if not, all
the better, okay?

05:57.658 --> 06:00.027
Okay.
Okay. Sonja, Chris,

06:00.060 --> 06:02.430
check surveillance
cameras at the floodwall.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.798
Sebastian, see if you and
Loretta can figure out

06:04.832 --> 06:06.934
what caused the gash
on Newell's arm.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.403
Patton, dig into his
life, but no hacking.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.905
Let's keep this
aboveboard.
Copy that.

06:11.939 --> 06:16.076
What do you want me to do?
Contact Isler,
see what the FBI knows.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.011
It's got to be something.
SEBASTIAN:
Whoa, wait. Hold on.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.013
Where are you going?
To talk to the lead investigator

06:20.047 --> 06:22.483
on the Clearwater case.
He might know something, too.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.486
Yeah, but I thought you said...
And then, I'm gonna
call Rita in D.C.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.954
She's in national
security now.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.056
She can backchannel DOJ,

06:29.089 --> 06:31.725
find out who Newell was about
to testify against.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.060
Come on, let's learn things!

06:34.495 --> 06:37.030
So much for treating
this like any other case.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.734
We can't talk about Newell here.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.470
Let's take a walk.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.472
Got prying eyes and
ears everywhere.
Okay.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.973
Almost like it was back

06:46.006 --> 06:48.509
when you and I helped bust
the first Governor Edwards.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.977
Why? What's going on, Charlie?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.579
What... How did
Newell get out?

06:51.612 --> 06:54.114
Just like they
all do-- cut a deal.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.016
He's not the
only one, either.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.619
What do you mean he's not
the only one? Who else got out?

06:58.652 --> 06:59.953
Mr. Fournier, you
owe me a call.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.723
Sorry, Ms., uh, Schumaker.
I ran into a friend.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.025
Dwayne Pride, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Schumaker.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.028
Down here from D.C.,
helping out on a... case.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.564
I think you can say
"Clearwater," seeing as how

07:10.598 --> 07:11.965
Agent Pride here was so involved

07:11.999 --> 07:14.034
in helping us prosecute
the case in the first place.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.937
Read all your briefs.
Feel like we've already met.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.206
Nice to meet you, Ms. Schumaker.
Something going on

07:19.239 --> 07:20.941
with Clearwater
I don't know about?

07:20.974 --> 07:22.576
I'm afraid
that's on a need-to-know basis.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.879
Well, I might need to know.
Investigating a possible murder.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.881
Sailor was a coconspirator.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.750
I didn't hear about that.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.885
Let me look into it,
and I'll get back to you.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.588
I'll expect your call.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.789
Ma'am.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.594
Newell got killed? When?

07:40.628 --> 07:43.030
Last night, and I'm not sure
he was killed yet,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.098
but if he was,
my chief suspect's

07:45.132 --> 07:47.067
gonna be whoever he was willing
to testify against.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.036
I need a name, Charlie.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.604
Everybody wants
that name, Dwayne.

07:50.638 --> 07:51.972
That's why Schumaker's here,

07:52.005 --> 07:53.774
what this whole
thing's about.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.809
Hamilton's mystery partner?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.911
Hamilton had the
ego and connections,

07:57.945 --> 08:00.648
but you always suspected that
the deep pockets and the muscles

08:00.681 --> 08:02.115
had to come from
somebody else.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.651
We just couldn't
prove it.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.819
Yeah, but Newell?
He knew who it was?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.788
Newell had a piece
of the puzzle, maybe,

08:07.821 --> 08:10.090
but two other coconspirators
had pieces, also.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.893
They used them to cut
deals and get out, too.
Who?

08:12.926 --> 08:15.262
Doesn't matter.
They got killed, too.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.997
Mystery man is
taking them all out,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.699
making it look
like accidents.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.300
Obviously doesn't
want to be found,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.536
but the Feds aren't
leaving town until they do.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.008
I ain't gonna lose any sleep
over Newell's death, Dwayne.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.744
Or the others.
Okay.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.113
I know we both feel the same.
You almost lost your job

08:33.146 --> 08:35.215
because of what they did.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.151
I lost my wife.
I remember, Charlie.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.920
If Hamilton walks, Dwayne,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.989
I swear to God,
I'll kill him myself.
Okay.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.891
I know, Charlie, I know.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.225
But he's in for life,

08:45.258 --> 08:47.695
and that's gonna
have to be enough.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.265
It's not enough for me.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.743
Anything
to connect Newell's death

09:02.776 --> 09:05.145
to the other coconspirators
I called you about?

09:05.178 --> 09:09.249
Uh, no, nothing yet.
Uh, Sebastian's with Wade,

09:09.282 --> 09:11.184
but she hasn't finished
the autopsy yet.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.754
And nothing NOPD sent
on the other two vics

09:13.787 --> 09:15.689
indicates anything
other than accidents.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.157
Well,
then we're missing something

09:17.190 --> 09:18.659
because they're not accidents.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.960
They're connected
to Clearwater.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.228
King?
What about Gregorio?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.963
Has Isler
or the FBI called?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.665
Have they given us anything
to go on yet?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.834
Not that we're
aware of.
Well, come on, people!

09:26.867 --> 09:28.969
We got to move faster, then,
we got to dig deeper.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.137
Too many bad people
who are supposed

09:30.170 --> 09:31.805
to be in prison
are getting out,

09:31.839 --> 09:34.174
and if we can't figure out
who's killing them,

09:34.207 --> 09:35.843
who Hamilton's
mystery partner is,

09:35.876 --> 09:38.045
we're never gonna figure out...
WOMAN:
Dwayne?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.881
Surprise!

09:42.883 --> 09:45.185
(laughs)
What?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.286
Rita!

09:46.319 --> 09:47.888
(kissing sound)
Hi.
RITA: Hi.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.657
Wait. Weren't you in D.C.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.124
when I called you this morning?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.293
Yes, I was...
Okay, so then,
I don't understand.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.763
So you just flew in then?
Not that I'm complaining, but...

10:01.835 --> 10:04.304
What's going on?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.373
What happened?

10:06.406 --> 10:10.110
Um, I didn't want to tell
you this over the phone.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.247
(sighs)
Hamilton's about
to make a deal.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.149
He's turning
state's evidence.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.019
He's getting out
of prison, Dwayne.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.226
(laughs)
Over my dead body.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.176
(typing)
(sighs)

10:48.348 --> 10:50.450
Sorry. I wake you?
No.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.285
Maybe, but it's okay.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.454
I understand.
You up? You want some coffee?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.824
No. I'm fine.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.892
Sit. Obsess.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.293
(chuckles softly)
I mean it.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.062
I know you, Dwayne.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.064
I know if you don't find a way

11:04.097 --> 11:06.299
to keep Hamilton
behind bars, you'll be a...

11:06.333 --> 11:07.735
pain.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.969
Well, gee, thank you

11:09.002 --> 11:10.738
for your support.
(laughs)

11:10.771 --> 11:13.774
Trying to figure out who
Hamilton's mystery partner is?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.142
(sighs) Yeah.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.077
That's the only way
they'd let him out;

11:17.110 --> 11:20.080
he's got to be a pretty
catch for DOJ, too.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.917
If I can figure out who it is
before he gives up the name,

11:23.951 --> 11:26.086
he loses his bargaining chip,

11:26.119 --> 11:27.387
stays in prison.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.956
And then everything
you've gone though

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
won't be for naught, right?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.760
Something like that.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.128
That a bad thing?
Depends on how far
you're willing to go

11:35.162 --> 11:38.465
to keep Hamilton in prison.
Hopefully not as far

11:38.498 --> 11:40.467
as you nearly went
to put him there.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.836
I can't just let him walk, Rita.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.305
I know you don't want
to lose him, Dwayne,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.107
but I don't want
to lose you, either.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.379
When do you have to go back?

11:52.412 --> 11:53.881
(sighs)

11:53.914 --> 11:54.915
When I know you're okay.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.420
(dog barking in distance)

12:02.890 --> 12:04.091
SONJA:
Oh, my gosh.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.893
Will you stop
barking like this?

12:05.926 --> 12:07.527
You stop it!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.529
PRIDE: Sonja?
Huh? Ooh!

12:09.562 --> 12:11.264
I'm sorry.
Look at what you did, girl--

12:11.298 --> 12:14.935
you woke up my boss.
I had to bring her.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.104
Unfortunately, she listens
better to Gregorio than me.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.773
What are you doing here?
It's 5:30.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.909
PATTON: (grunts)
Got a bad guy to find,

12:21.942 --> 12:23.977
no time to find him, man.
Good to see you again, Rita.

12:24.011 --> 12:24.812
You, too, Patton.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.980
Sooner we find
Hamilton's partner,

12:27.014 --> 12:28.215
the sooner we don't
have to worry about you.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
(clears throat) Coffee on?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.284
It's brewing.
ISLER: Good.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.053
'Cause I could use a cup myself.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.088
Isler.
(barking, growling)

12:36.256 --> 12:37.190
Really?
GREGORIO:
Oh, don't mind her--

12:37.224 --> 12:38.425
she doesn't like cops.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.793
But you're cops, too.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.995
GREGORIO: Hey, Rita,
welcome back.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.230
RITA: Glad to be
back, and glad

12:43.263 --> 12:45.365
to see you guys have his back.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.433
Always.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.169
All right, come on,

12:49.202 --> 12:51.404
let's learn things.
(clapping)

12:55.876 --> 12:58.178
Thank you.
There you go.
All right.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.813
Thank you.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.515
So I just got off the phone
with the warden at Slidell.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.117
Hamilton's scheduled to be taken
to the federal courthouse

13:04.151 --> 13:06.553
at noon tomorrow,
under heavy guard.
Okay,

13:06.586 --> 13:09.890
so we have until then to find
out who's behind all this

13:09.923 --> 13:11.058
before Hamilton walks.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.225
Must be quite a prize.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.827
I've got all my D.C. contacts

13:13.861 --> 13:15.462
trying to figure out
who it could possibly be,

13:15.495 --> 13:17.530
but DOJ's pretty tight-lipped.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.367
FBI's looking into the other
coconspirator deaths, right?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.235
I mean, see if
they were murdered, too?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.171
I have the FBI
working with NOPD right now.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.173
Good, 'cause if we can find out
who killed both them

13:26.206 --> 13:28.208
and Newell...
We can get the partner's name,

13:28.241 --> 13:30.343
and beat Hamilton to the punch.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.511
PRIDE: Really
appreciate you

13:31.544 --> 13:33.146
helping us out on this,
Raymond.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.048
I'm not just doing this
for you, Pride.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.416
IDing Hamilton's
partner without

13:36.449 --> 13:38.051
losing Hamilton's a big win.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.920
Might just get me back to D.C.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.855
(Skype ringing
on multiple phones)

13:41.889 --> 13:43.490
ALL:
Sebastian!

13:43.523 --> 13:45.358
Aw, man, you hit
Group Skype, dude.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.894
Whoa.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.296
It's a crazy Brady Bunch
flashback.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.563
WADE:
Dwayne,

13:50.597 --> 13:52.299
think we might've
found something.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.600
Your sailor had traces

13:53.633 --> 13:55.035
of carbon fiber in his wound.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.104
Yea, high tech, too.
Very specific.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.006
Designed for high-speed flight
so that the composite

13:59.039 --> 14:01.274
doesn't break apart. It's
usually found in propellers.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.175
Propellers?

14:02.209 --> 14:03.243
Right, sorry, that's...

14:03.276 --> 14:04.344
I'm burying the lede. Um,

14:04.377 --> 14:05.512
we think that Newell

14:05.545 --> 14:07.280
was hit by a
drone propeller.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.516
WADE: Right, if it was a
defensive wound, it was because

14:09.549 --> 14:11.518
somebody was attacking him
with a drone.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.321
Then somebody was trying
to make him fall into the water.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.889
Sounds like murder to me.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.524
And a very specific murderer.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.192
You know, drones
are not easy to fly,

14:19.226 --> 14:21.061
especially when someone
is using it as a weapon.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.230
You want me to revisit
your Clearwater files

14:23.263 --> 14:24.898
and see if any players
have that kind of expertise?

14:24.932 --> 14:27.334
Yeah, that's
a good idea, thanks.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.902
Hey, Sebastian,

14:28.936 --> 14:30.270
get with my forensics agents.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.205
See if drones could've
been used with

14:32.239 --> 14:34.041
either one
of the coconspirators, too.
Copy that.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.208
Bobby Brady out.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.309
(chuckles)

14:39.079 --> 14:40.347
What's the matter, Chris?

14:40.380 --> 14:43.083
I don't know.
I mean, I get how solving

14:43.116 --> 14:45.318
the sailor's murder gets us
closer to Hamilton's partner,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.221
but if he's that big a deal...
SONJA: He wouldn't get
his hands dirty

14:48.255 --> 14:50.223
with drones, let alone murder.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.692
So, then, we're looking
for a gun for hire.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.561
It still should lead us
to the partner's name.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.229
But maybe not in time.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.265
Yeah.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.400
ISLER:
Hey, Pride...

15:00.433 --> 15:01.634
where you going?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.239
To have a chat with the one
person who does know the name.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.308
Who, Hamilton? You're
gonna go and see him?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.543
Pride, that's a bad idea,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.079
SONJA: Besides, he wouldn't
tell you anything anyway.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.948
That name is his
Get Out of Jail Free card.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.984
Well, he might not be in
such a hurry to get out, though,

15:17.017 --> 15:18.285
once I tell him somebody's

15:18.318 --> 15:19.519
gonna kill him.
GREGORIO: You can't...

15:20.587 --> 15:21.521
Go.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.459
(Isler exhales)

15:27.494 --> 15:29.296
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

15:33.433 --> 15:36.203
Oh, God.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.240
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

15:42.375 --> 15:44.011
Thank you.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.612
Well, well...

15:45.645 --> 15:47.214
(chuckling): ...well.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.381
What a surprise.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.582
It's Dwayne Pride

15:49.616 --> 15:51.718
and the lovely little lady

15:51.751 --> 15:54.054
who stopped you
from shooting me.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.422
Tell you what,
when I get out of here,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.057
I'd really love
to buy you a drink,

15:57.090 --> 15:59.126
you know, say thanks.
Two strikes.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.760
I'm gay and I hate your guts.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.596
Oh...
Cut the crap, Douglas, sit down.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.367
I'm here for one reason,
one reason only.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.569
I want you to tell me
who your partner is.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.505
Yeah, well, you're just
gonna have to wait, Dwayne.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.141
'Cause, as I'm sure
you've heard,

16:14.174 --> 16:15.708
my entire future depends on...

16:15.742 --> 16:17.444
You don't have a future.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.446
Douglas, your partner
is gonna kill you,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.381
just like he killed
everybody else who was

16:21.414 --> 16:23.583
stupid enough to think that
they could make a deal, too.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.119
Yeah, I don't believe you.
Then you're an idiot.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.588
You sure you don't
want to have those drinks?
You don't want to believe me?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.590
Fine. You can rot in hell,
as far as I'm concerned,

16:30.623 --> 16:32.725
for everything you've done.
Yeah, well, first,
I'm getting out of here.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.595
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Well, empty threats
ain't gonna stop me.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.565
They're not empty threats.
People died

16:38.598 --> 16:41.468
because of you. They trusted
you, and you used them,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.171
just like
you use everybody else.
Pride...

16:44.204 --> 16:46.239
You don't just
get to walk out of here,

16:46.273 --> 16:47.707
you don't get
to get away with it.
You gonna finish what

16:47.740 --> 16:49.476
you started, huh?
You don't get to
get out of here.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.510
You gonna finish
what you started? Yeah?
Yes, I am!

16:50.543 --> 16:51.644
You gonna take me out yourself?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.346
If I have to.
Is that right?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.381
That's right.
Well, that's tough talk.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.682
Let me tell you something,

16:55.715 --> 16:57.217
we both know better, don't we?
Guard!

16:57.250 --> 16:58.518
And we both know....

16:58.551 --> 17:00.153
that tomorrow,

17:00.187 --> 17:02.055
whether you like it or not,

17:02.089 --> 17:03.790
I'm a free man.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.358
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

17:05.392 --> 17:07.127
So deal with that.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.201
(door closes)

17:27.280 --> 17:28.748
Pride.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.517
You know, there's
still a chance

17:30.550 --> 17:31.718
Hamilton doesn't get out.
We still have time...

17:31.751 --> 17:33.720
Maybe we ought
to just let him walk,

17:33.753 --> 17:35.388
let his partner
take care of him.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.390
Come on, you
don't mean that.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.559
That's not right,
that's not what we do.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.228
That's what he would do.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.700
Who is that?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.508
My father.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.513
Dwayne?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.515
Let's go.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.291
You're not gonna
like this, King.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.193
We think we know
who killed our sailor

18:13.226 --> 18:15.628
and the other two.
SONJA: Which means
he's got to be working

18:15.662 --> 18:16.763
for Hamilton's partner.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.865
So why won't I like it?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.503
Wait, Fournier? Are you sure?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.472
SONJA: DA asked him to
assist DOJ's investigation

18:25.505 --> 18:27.540
into Clearwater
last year.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.508
He knows all
the players.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.578
And he requested to help
this time, again...

18:31.611 --> 18:33.313
when they started cutting deals.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.148
Plus, Patton checked
the car and cell GPS,

18:35.182 --> 18:37.884
so we can place him
at each location

18:37.917 --> 18:40.420
around the time
of all three murders.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.621
LASALLE:
Expert investigator,

18:41.654 --> 18:43.856
knows how to cover his tracks.

18:43.890 --> 18:47.660
Not exactly hard evidence.
Maybe not, but...

18:47.694 --> 18:50.930
his hobby is drones, Pride.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.267
Races them recreationally.
Supposedly, he's good at it.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.502
LASALLE:
Even worse,

18:55.535 --> 18:56.636
Fournier's
bank account--

18:56.669 --> 18:57.904
a lot of money
has been deposited

18:57.937 --> 18:59.606
into his account
the last couple of weeks,

18:59.639 --> 19:02.509
including $9,000 just yesterday.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.810
Right after Newell
was killed.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.878
And when you factor in
what happened to his wife...

19:05.912 --> 19:07.514
He's got motive.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.881
Revenge.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.483
Think it's safe to assume

19:10.517 --> 19:11.818
he's supposed
to kill Hamilton too,

19:11.851 --> 19:13.586
soon as he gets out of prison.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.921
GREGORIO: If Fournier's
motive is revenge,

19:14.954 --> 19:16.289
why would he
work with the partner?

19:16.323 --> 19:17.557
why wouldn't he just kill him?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.492
Well, knowing Charlie,
he wants to make sure

19:19.526 --> 19:21.494
he gets everybody responsible.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.431
He's always been
methodical that way.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.732
Sorry, King.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.634
Know how close
you two are.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.672
Stay here, we're gonna
go make the arrest.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.806
Yeah.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.343
PRIDE:
No.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.212
We can't arrest him, not yet.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.648
SONJA: Why not?
Newell's our case.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.583
We know who did it,
don't we have to...
No, but if we

19:43.616 --> 19:45.218
arrest Charlie now,
he'll lawyer up.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.686
Which means there's
no way he'll tell us

19:46.719 --> 19:48.688
who the partner
is before...

19:48.721 --> 19:51.691
before Hamilton walks.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.697
And that's not happening.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.332
MAN:
Let me get this straight--

19:59.366 --> 20:00.867
you're asking to go rogue?

20:00.900 --> 20:04.571
Oh, no, it's not really rogue
if NCIS approves it.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.006
It's more like, um...
undercover.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.242
To do what, exactly, again?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.778
To make Fournier believe
that I want to kill Hamilton

20:11.811 --> 20:13.380
just as much as he does.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.814
This is crazy, Dwayne.
I know,

20:14.847 --> 20:17.684
JJ, it's crazy,
but we don't have much time.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.552
And it's the only way
to get the name

20:19.586 --> 20:20.887
of Hamilton's mystery partner

20:20.920 --> 20:23.423
and keep Hamilton in prison.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.558
NCIS has to want that, too.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.395
Of course we do,
but it just seems risky,

20:28.428 --> 20:30.930
especially considering
your history with Hamilton.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.034
I don't like it.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.270
I don't like it at all.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.971
And, just for the record,
if this backfires,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.707
you're not gonna like it,
either.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.476
Is that a yes?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.947
(clicks tongue)
All right.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.917
What do you want me to do?

20:50.950 --> 20:53.386
I want you to fire me.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.703
You do realize everybody's
talking about

21:10.737 --> 21:12.305
you getting fired, right?

21:12.339 --> 21:13.806
Oh, glad to hear
it's getting around.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.508
Hopefully, Charlie's
heard about it, too.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.709
What... Charlie.... Fournier?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.010
This is-this is the man

21:18.044 --> 21:20.046
that you're going to,
what, team up with

21:20.079 --> 21:22.682
to kill Hamilton, if I
understand this plan correctly?

21:22.715 --> 21:25.452
Relax, Isler, it's just a ruse.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.353
It's not like
I'm going off-book again.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.320
HQ has sanctioned it.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.022
Besides, I'm not actually
gonna kill Hamilton,

21:30.056 --> 21:32.058
just threaten him,
so stop worrying.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.893
Worry?
Why-why should I worry?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.762
It's a perfectly
reasonable plan,

21:35.795 --> 21:37.964
except for the fact that you
almost did kill Hamilton,

21:37.997 --> 21:39.799
or have you forgotten
that little incident?

21:39.832 --> 21:40.800
Nope, I remember.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.034
RITA:
Sorry, I forget--

21:42.068 --> 21:44.471
do you want the shotgun
or the .45?

21:44.504 --> 21:45.572
PRIDE:
Uh...

21:45.605 --> 21:46.939
better take both, just in case.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.709
Since I'm no longer NCIS,

21:49.742 --> 21:52.111
decided I had better leave

21:52.144 --> 21:53.913
my service weapon behind.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.483
Don't want Charlie
to get suspicious.

21:56.516 --> 21:57.850
ISLER: What? Look,
it's a tall order,

21:57.884 --> 21:59.852
expecting him not
to be suspicious.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
And you're okay with all this?

22:01.688 --> 22:04.424
No, of course not.
I'm worried sick.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.426
But if Dwayne can get
close enough to Charlie,

22:06.459 --> 22:08.395
convince him that they're
on the same side...

22:08.428 --> 22:10.697
Then maybe he'll tell me
who Hamilton's partner is

22:10.730 --> 22:12.499
before we have to kill him.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.000
Which you're not
gonna actually do.

22:15.034 --> 22:15.868
Remember?

22:15.902 --> 22:18.070
Right. But the good news
is that even if

22:18.104 --> 22:20.540
Dwayne doesn't get the name
first, he'll be in a position

22:20.573 --> 22:22.008
to save Hamilton from Charlie

22:22.041 --> 22:23.610
if it comes down to that.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.077
ISLER: Ah, so, now
you're gonna actually

22:25.111 --> 22:27.747
save Hamilton. Is that right?

22:27.780 --> 22:29.048
Hamilton's due in court at 3:00

22:29.081 --> 22:30.883
to give up his partner's name,

22:30.917 --> 22:33.152
which means we have until then

22:33.185 --> 22:35.021
to get that name first.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.589
I'm still working
my D.C. contacts,

22:36.623 --> 22:37.757
but I'm not optimistic.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.058
Keep trying.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.593
Isler, I'm hoping

22:40.627 --> 22:42.529
you can coordinate
my team from here.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.497
Patton's working
Charlie's cell, laptop,

22:44.531 --> 22:45.898
and routing numbers,

22:45.932 --> 22:47.166
trying to get the
name that way.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.968
And where's the rest
of your team?

22:49.001 --> 22:49.936
Setting up
at the courthouse in case

22:49.969 --> 22:51.771
we don't ID the partner in time.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.106
Which means I've got to
get to Charlie first.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.010
(sighs)

23:03.916 --> 23:05.652
Hey! Whoa!

23:05.685 --> 23:08.020
Dwayne, what the
hell are you doing?

23:08.054 --> 23:09.021
Just drive, Charlie.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.389
Go!

23:13.526 --> 23:15.094
What's the matter?

23:15.127 --> 23:16.996
Somebody after you?
No.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.831
Somebody's after you.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.033
My team knows

23:21.067 --> 23:22.702
that you killed Newell
and the others.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.736
You got to be kidding, man.
Skip it.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.171
They know because I know.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.873
I know about the
money, the drones,

23:26.906 --> 23:28.207
covering your tracks.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.842
Did you think I wouldn't
figure it out?

23:29.876 --> 23:31.678
You screwed up, Charlie.
I don't care.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.112
Those bastards deserved it,
and you know it.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.747
I'm not saying they didn't.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.883
I just can't believe
it's you doing it.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.685
Yeah, well, believe it, 'cause
there was no way I was gonna

23:38.718 --> 23:40.987
let them get away with what they
did, what happened. No way.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.522
So, what,
you gonna bust me?

23:42.555 --> 23:43.990
Is that it?

23:44.023 --> 23:45.191
That's how you plan on

23:45.224 --> 23:46.626
getting your
freaking badge back.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.860
You gonna throw me
to the wolves.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.228
You heard about that?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.930
You kidding?

23:50.963 --> 23:52.799
The great Dwayne Pride
getting his ass canned?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.867
It's a small town, brother.
That's big news.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.969
Listen, man, if you think
I'm just gonna let you

23:57.003 --> 23:58.070
turn me in...
I'm not gonna bust you,

23:58.104 --> 24:00.106
Charlie, that's not
why I'm here.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.608
I don't want my
badge back, anyway,

24:01.641 --> 24:02.909
not if NCIS is willing

24:02.942 --> 24:04.877
to let Hamilton walk.
All right, then.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.145
So what do you want?

24:06.178 --> 24:08.681
I want what you want.

24:08.715 --> 24:11.017
I want Hamilton.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.099
GREGORIO:
Showtime.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.968
Hamilton just arrived
at the courthouse.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.269
He's already
wearing a suit, too.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.938
Think he knows

24:31.971 --> 24:33.039
he's gonna walk or what?

24:33.072 --> 24:34.541
GREGORIO: I wouldn't
doubt it for a second.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.543
Any sign of Pride?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.677
LASALLE:
He's just arriving now,

24:37.710 --> 24:40.046
too, with Fournier.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.247
Good news is marshals

24:41.280 --> 24:43.082
won't let any weapons past,

24:43.115 --> 24:44.617
so at least Fournier's unarmed.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.085
But still, he's got to have
some other way of trying

24:46.118 --> 24:48.054
to take Hamilton out.
LASALLE: Yeah. If he does,

24:48.087 --> 24:49.055
Pride'll stop him.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.256
ISLER:
Let's hope so.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.924
All right, let's stay focused.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.893
Let's wait and
see what happens.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.163
BAILIFF:
All rise.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.965
While court is in session,
there will be no audio

24:58.998 --> 25:01.801
or video recording devices
allowed in the courtroom.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.537
Please remain silent
during the proceedings.

25:04.571 --> 25:07.006
If you have a cell phone,
please silence it now.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.008
Honorable Chief Judge Edwin
Miller, U.S. District Court

25:09.041 --> 25:10.777
for the Eastern District
He won't be smiling for long.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.579
of Louisiana presiding.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.013
Be seated.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.083
Aren't we supposed
to take out Hamilton

25:17.116 --> 25:18.751
before he reveals the name?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.186
I mean, isn't that
the whole point?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.988
How are we gonna do it in here?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.289
You want to go through
with this or don't you?

25:23.322 --> 25:25.057
More than anything.
But I also want

25:25.091 --> 25:26.659
to get away with it.
Trust me.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.094
We will. I've got friends

25:28.127 --> 25:29.662
in high places.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.097
I understand the defendant,

25:31.130 --> 25:32.131
Douglas Hamilton,

25:32.164 --> 25:33.065
and the U.S. Attorney

25:33.099 --> 25:35.067
have reached a plea deal,
Ms. Schumaker?

25:35.101 --> 25:37.604
Yes, Your Honor.
We have. In exchange

25:37.637 --> 25:39.138
for the identity
of his coconspirator,

25:39.171 --> 25:41.007
of which Mr. Hamilton
has provided

25:41.040 --> 25:42.775
fully vetted evidence
to support our belief

25:42.809 --> 25:44.977
that once he provides
a name, we'll be able

25:45.011 --> 25:46.045
to prosecute the entire...
I have it all

25:46.078 --> 25:48.014
in front of me, Ms. Schumaker.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.082
Thank you. But what I don't have

25:50.116 --> 25:52.151
is Mr. Hamilton's
signed release papers

25:52.184 --> 25:54.754
in the event of judgment.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.592
I, uh...

25:59.626 --> 26:00.860
must have left them

26:00.893 --> 26:02.995
in the conference room.
May I?

26:03.029 --> 26:05.097
Go on. Please hurry.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.337
(fire alarm blaring)

26:11.370 --> 26:13.172
GUARD:
Ladies and gentlemen!

26:13.205 --> 26:14.907
Please make your way
to the north hall.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.743
(frightened chatter,
alarm continues blaring)

26:16.776 --> 26:18.344
GUARD:
Once outside...

26:18.377 --> 26:20.179
With me,
Mr. Hamilton.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.614
What's going on?

26:22.782 --> 26:24.383
What do you mean, someone pulled
the fire alarm?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.118
That's awfully convenient.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.322
(alarm continues blaring)
Please continue to exit...

26:30.356 --> 26:32.058
They're taking
Hamilton away.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.060
What are we waiting for?
You'll see. This way.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.202
Sit here.
All right, uh, hold-hold on.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.837
Now, shouldn't we
be getting out of here?

26:44.871 --> 26:46.639
What if there's really a fire?
I don't understand.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.143
Grab his gun.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.982
Dwayne? The hell is going on?

26:56.015 --> 26:57.183
Hurry up. Shoot him.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.689
What are you waiting for?

27:02.722 --> 27:03.723
Shoot him!

27:04.757 --> 27:06.726
Who are you working for?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.161
Who's his partner?

27:09.195 --> 27:10.196
Wait, what?

27:10.229 --> 27:11.864
You're under arrest, Charlie.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.065
Three counts of murder,

27:13.099 --> 27:14.166
conspiracy to commit.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.334
Give me a name.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.803
Maybe you can
cut a deal, too.

27:16.836 --> 27:17.904
It's your only chance.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.138
You're kidding me.
You're playing me?

27:19.171 --> 27:20.673
For what? To help
that piece of crap?

27:20.707 --> 27:21.774
(gunshots)

27:32.118 --> 27:34.020
Really? I'm the biggest threat
right now?

27:37.223 --> 27:38.825
Roger, copy that.
Third floor clear.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.392
Going to fourth floor.
Headed to fourth floor.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.262
Ma'am?
Dwayne Pride.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.397
He shot Charlie.
He kidnapped Hamilton.

27:51.938 --> 27:54.273
What? What? No, what...?
(screams)

27:54.306 --> 27:57.276
What are you doing?
Just move.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.978
Excuse me.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.780
Have you seen them leave?
No, did you?

28:01.313 --> 28:02.749
We lost 'em, Isler.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.183
Both of them.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.119
Damn it.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.965
It's all over the news, Isler.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.968
That, coupled with APBs
and BOLOs out for Pride--

28:22.001 --> 28:24.036
it's a full-on manhunt.
It's more like a witch hunt.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.504
I mean, it's just like last year
with Hamilton, only worse.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.039
This time they think
Pride killed a man.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.775
What a mess.

28:28.808 --> 28:29.976
(sighs) Leave it to Pride.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.477
I just don't get why he ran.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.345
I mean, if he's innocent,
then...

28:33.379 --> 28:35.347
"If," Sebastian?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.249
Well, I mean...
You know what I mean.
Yeah, Sebastian's right, though.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.086
I mean, why take off
with Hamilton? Why not

28:40.119 --> 28:42.021
just stick around
and say what really happened?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.056
RITA:
Only one explanation.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.958
Dwayne was trying to save him,

28:45.992 --> 28:47.894
just like he said
he was going to do.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.328
Yeah, but save him from who?

28:49.361 --> 28:52.164
Whoever was lying in wait,
working with Fournier.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.100
Which means he was working
for Hamilton's partner, too.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.902
Obviously at the courthouse

28:55.935 --> 28:57.970
to take both Hamilton
and Fournier out.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.505
To cover his tracks, which is
apparently what he does best,

28:59.538 --> 29:01.340
or we'd know who he is by now.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.242
Uh, no luck

29:03.275 --> 29:04.911
with your D.C. contacts,
I take it?
No.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.979
And I have tried
everyone I know, too.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.114
SEBASTIAN:
Okay, but if we can figure out

29:08.147 --> 29:09.982
who pulled the trigger,
then we can

29:10.016 --> 29:11.083
at least figure out
the partner's name.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.451
Which exonerates Pride

29:12.484 --> 29:13.519
and puts Hamilton

29:13.552 --> 29:14.921
back in prison.

29:14.954 --> 29:15.888
ISLER:
All right.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.790
I already told the FBI

29:17.824 --> 29:19.058
that I'm taking lead on this.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.259
The courthouse
surveillance cameras

29:20.292 --> 29:22.394
are coming here first. I want
you two to pour over them.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.430
We got to find that killer.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.165
You got it. Let's roll.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.935
Are Gregorio and Percy
still at the courthouse?

29:28.968 --> 29:31.403
Yeah, trying to figure out
how Pride and Hamilton escaped.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.106
Help them. We got
to find Pride before NOPD.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.175
We can't save him or Hamilton
unless we do.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.076
I'm on it.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.111
(sighs)

29:40.512 --> 29:42.148
What?

29:42.181 --> 29:44.116
You're not just doing this

29:44.150 --> 29:46.152
to try and get
your old job back. You...

29:47.486 --> 29:50.222
...care about Dwayne, don't you?
(scoffs)

29:50.256 --> 29:53.125
I can neither confirm
or deny that, Counselor.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.161
(chuckling):
Okay.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.263
Uh, excuse me.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.131
Where are you going?

29:59.165 --> 30:01.167
See what I can find
out at the courthouse.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.434
I'm DOJ, too.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.336
Besides...

30:04.370 --> 30:07.039
you're not the only one
who cares about Dwayne.

30:07.073 --> 30:10.009
Uh, Counselor?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.043
Hmm?

30:11.077 --> 30:13.012
Be careful.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.014
Killer could
still be there.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.854
HAMILTON: You're just driving
around in circles, aren't you?

30:21.888 --> 30:23.455
Well, sooner or later you're
gonna have to stop for gas,

30:23.489 --> 30:26.025
somebody's gonna spot
you, and I am just gonna

30:26.058 --> 30:27.259
scream for help.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.195
Or I could just
shoot you instead.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.197
I got plenty of bullets left.
Yeah, give me a break, Dwayne.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.999
You could have shot me by now
and you know it.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.233
Come on, man.

30:34.266 --> 30:37.203
Let's eat. Stop. I'm hungry.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.604
Tell me who your partner is,
I'll turn around.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.539
Yeah? Turn around,
take me back to prison?

30:40.572 --> 30:42.241
I don't think so. I told you,

30:42.274 --> 30:43.609
I'm not going back there.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.444
And I'm not giving you
a name, either.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.946
Sorry, I know
that's the reason

30:46.979 --> 30:48.447
you saved me back there
in the first place.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.116
No, I saved you
because I knew your partner

30:50.149 --> 30:51.383
was gonna try and kill you,
and I was right.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.551
You owe me.

30:52.584 --> 30:53.986
I owe you?
Yes.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.087
The same guy
that put me in prison

30:55.121 --> 30:57.156
in the first place?
You put yourself there, Douglas.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.190
You say tomato...
You know what?

30:58.224 --> 31:01.160
You ought to be more worried
about me right now

31:01.193 --> 31:02.528
than prison.
Eh.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.630
Just give me the name,
all right?

31:04.663 --> 31:06.165
Who do you think
you're kidding, huh?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.433
You don't got
the upper hand, Dwayne.

31:07.466 --> 31:08.534
I got the upper hand.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.169
Cops think you shot Fournier.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.003
They're after
you, not me.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.471
You might even
have to share a cell

31:12.504 --> 31:13.973
with your old man.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.307
Won't that be fun?

31:15.341 --> 31:16.909
I didn't shoot Charlie,
and you know it.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.110
Well, I'm not vouching for you.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.179
No way.
No way, baby.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.949
You the dead man here, not me.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.283
Dead man.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.484
We'll see about that.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.453
(tires squeal)

31:27.486 --> 31:29.255
What the hell
are you doing?

31:29.288 --> 31:30.522
Dwayne?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.560
Found out how Pride
escaped the courthouse.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.362
Somebody stole a fleet car
from the garage.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.097
Disabled
the security cameras, too.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.565
You get a plate?
Better.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.400
Got the VIN number, but already
sent it to Patton to see

31:41.433 --> 31:43.269
if he can hack into the GPS.
Good work.

31:43.302 --> 31:43.970
But not good enough.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.671
Look, if we
don't find Pride

31:45.704 --> 31:47.273
before he goes off the rails

31:47.306 --> 31:48.340
and takes Hamilton...
Look, don't-don't say it, okay?

31:48.374 --> 31:50.109
I mean, we all know
what the stakes are by now.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.377
All right, enough already.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.279
You got anything
from the courthouse cameras?

31:53.312 --> 31:55.681
Well, not until now.
Check this out.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.284
All right, that's the corridor
outside the holding room

31:58.317 --> 31:59.218
where Fournier was killed.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.586
Everyone is evacuating

32:00.619 --> 32:02.588
from the fire alarm, right?
Except her.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.092
Who's she?
Here, allow me.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.396
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Schumaker.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.598
Sounds legit.
Except it's not.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.501
Everyone is looking for her
at the courthouse,

32:15.534 --> 32:18.104
especially since she allegedly
witnessed the shooting.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.371
Let me guess,
she disappeared?

32:19.405 --> 32:21.240
Yeah. So I called D.C.,

32:21.273 --> 32:23.309
and I had the police go
to Joyce Schumaker's apartment,

32:23.342 --> 32:25.277
where they found her murdered.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.712
The killer stole her identity.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.547
RITA: But I stole
the killer's phone.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.516
She left it in the courtroom

32:30.549 --> 32:32.084
in her hurry
to get out of there.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.120
Oh, good work, Rita.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.387
Get this to Patton,
have him tear it apart.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.323
If that's the killer, then she
definitely had to have contact

32:37.356 --> 32:39.158
with the mystery partner.
Okay.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.526
Then I'll take over trying
to find where Pride's car's at.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.361
Already found it.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.495
Not gonna like where it is.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.031
Looks like he's
on his way to the levees

32:45.064 --> 32:46.465
they almost blew up last year.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.300
The levees. Why?

32:48.334 --> 32:51.270
Hopefully not to
finish what he started.

32:57.176 --> 33:00.146
PRIDE: Keep moving!
So, what, you're too much of
a coward to pull that trigger?

33:00.179 --> 33:03.349
Are you gonna push me in,
drown me? Is that it?

33:03.382 --> 33:05.217
This is where your partner
killed Newell.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.685
Right here.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.420
Yeah, well, you're not him.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.022
And you know what?

33:10.056 --> 33:11.323
I'm gonna call your bluff.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.325
Because you're too much
of a freaking Boy Scout.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.694
You talk tough, you
want to cross that line,

33:15.727 --> 33:18.030
but you can't.
I'm not gonna let you walk.

33:18.064 --> 33:21.433
You have no choice,
'cause you got nothing!

33:21.467 --> 33:22.534
(chuckles)

33:22.568 --> 33:24.403
Look at you.

33:24.436 --> 33:28.374
I bet you wish you were your
old man right about now, huh?

33:28.407 --> 33:31.077
'Cause old Cassius, he'd have
the balls to pull that trigger.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.413
He'd push me in there
without a second thought.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.647
But you?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.149
You can't.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.484
Yeah?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.452
(laughs)

33:41.587 --> 33:45.124
*

33:52.598 --> 33:55.167
You're right.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.270
I'm not.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.339
I'm not my old man.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.442
I'll find out
your partner's name another way.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.646
After he kills you.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.318
You think I'm afraid of him?

34:12.351 --> 34:16.222
Huh? You think that I don't
know exactly what I'm gonna do?

34:16.255 --> 34:17.789
How I'm gonna get away
with this?

34:17.823 --> 34:19.325
Well, screw you!

34:19.358 --> 34:21.227
Screw you, Dwayne!
Screw you...

34:21.260 --> 34:23.395
(shouting)

34:28.700 --> 34:30.236
(gasps) Dwayne!

34:30.269 --> 34:31.737
Dwayne, help me! Help...

34:45.517 --> 34:47.519
*

35:02.901 --> 35:05.604
*

35:34.666 --> 35:36.502
*

35:50.882 --> 35:51.883
(gasping)

35:52.351 --> 35:53.619
Come on!

35:57.989 --> 36:00.959
(panting)

36:00.992 --> 36:03.595
(groans)

36:03.629 --> 36:05.731
(coughing, laughing)

36:05.764 --> 36:07.899
(groans)

36:07.933 --> 36:09.301
What's so funny?

36:11.370 --> 36:13.605
I'm just so
confused, is all.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.574
Did you just actually save me?

36:15.607 --> 36:19.578
Don't flatter yourself.
It's... just instinct.

36:19.611 --> 36:23.215
You'll do anything to get me
back into prison, won't you?

36:24.716 --> 36:28.220
Just so you know,
it doesn't matter.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.988
I'm not giving you
my partner's name.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.223
ISLER:
That's okay.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.494
We already have it.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.230
Got it off the cell phone
from your partner's hit man.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.498
Actually, hit woman,

36:39.531 --> 36:41.800
who was hired by your partner
to kill you.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.369
But thanks to Pride,
she didn't.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.271
SEBASTIAN:
That's the good news.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.505
You want to know
what the bad news is?

36:46.538 --> 36:48.707
LASALLE: Now that we
know the name, deal's off.

36:48.740 --> 36:52.878
You're going back
to prison, Hamilton.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.314
(grunts)

36:57.416 --> 36:59.551
Now I'm sad you saved me.

36:59.585 --> 37:03.221
Now I'm glad I did.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.829
NEWS ANCHOR:
The FBI arrested

37:10.862 --> 37:12.898
Chief Judge Edwin Miller
this morning

37:12.931 --> 37:14.900
for conspiracy,
extortion, fraud,

37:14.933 --> 37:17.035
and contract murder charges
in connection

37:17.068 --> 37:20.005
with the Clearwater shipyard
scandal last year.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.507
Sources say
that Miller was working

37:21.540 --> 37:23.041
with the previously convicted
Mayor Hamilton

37:23.074 --> 37:25.577
as well as organized crime,

37:25.611 --> 37:29.047
which was allegedly funding
the illegal project. Now...

37:29.080 --> 37:31.483
PATTON: Going out
on a limb here.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.018
I'm-a say
that's a big win for you.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.921
For all of us. For all of us.
A big win for all of us.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.591
Although I will say I would feel
much better if we had nailed

37:39.625 --> 37:41.660
Miller's hired gun, too.
You'll find her.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.429
And if you
don't, we will.

37:43.462 --> 37:47.733
Nobody messes
with NCIS. Yas.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.735
(chuckles)
(growling)

37:49.768 --> 37:52.904
Do you guys have a license
for that dog?

37:52.938 --> 37:54.973
Do you have insurance
for your kneecaps?

37:55.006 --> 37:57.409
I think that's my cue to leave.
(barks)

37:57.443 --> 37:59.611
Hey, Isler,

37:59.645 --> 38:01.413
thanks for helping us.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.081
I mean it.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.050
LASALLE: Yeah,
especially for helping us

38:05.083 --> 38:06.518
save Pride.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.786
Just doing my job.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.388
Besides,
as far as I'm concerned,

38:09.421 --> 38:10.422
Pride saved himself.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.991
At least, that's how
I hope his bosses see it.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.664
PRINCE: Everything looks
in order to me, Agent Pride.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.366
Thank you, sir.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.700
Didn't go off-book at all.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.337
I'll be the judge of that.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.442
And my judgment is
you don't have to worry

38:30.476 --> 38:32.678
about us looking
over your shoulder anymore.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.747
Congratulations,
you're officially cleared.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.816
(chuckles softly)

38:38.884 --> 38:41.453
What about my team?

38:41.487 --> 38:43.054
What about them?

38:43.088 --> 38:44.723
Are they cleared, too?

38:44.756 --> 38:47.426
They were never
under investigation, Dwayne,

38:47.459 --> 38:49.060
just you.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.430
Fair warning, though--

38:51.463 --> 38:52.798
stay off my radar.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.633
No second chances here.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.905
So, what are you
gonna do to celebrate?

39:12.484 --> 39:14.453
RITA:
Are you sure about this?

39:14.486 --> 39:16.054
PRIDE:
It's long overdue.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.989
Do you want me
to come in with you?

39:18.023 --> 39:20.459
No, no. Thanks.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.827
I just..

39:21.860 --> 39:24.796
You got a plane to catch.
You got to get home.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.498
How are you getting home?

39:26.532 --> 39:28.099
I'll figure something out.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.101
Hey.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.438
Come on.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.172
Don't worry about me.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.941
I'm gonna be okay.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.176
I know.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.911
Thanks for coming.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.747
Thanks for being here
for me.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.682
My pleasure.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.505
*

40:31.897 --> 40:34.500
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

40:38.269 --> 40:40.839
We're fine.

40:43.842 --> 40:47.813
If you're here for a thank you,
you can just forget it.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.215
Well, I didn't help get you
paroled for you, Dad--

40:50.248 --> 40:51.717
I did it for me.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.119
Oh, yeah? How's that?

40:54.152 --> 40:56.555
You wouldn't
understand.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.057
Or probably care,
for that matter.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.226
Oh, poor Dwayne.

41:01.259 --> 41:04.530
Your big bad daddy hurt you
that much, did he?

41:08.867 --> 41:10.569
Tell me something:

41:10.602 --> 41:14.806
how did you turn out
to be so good, then?

41:14.840 --> 41:17.943
I don't know how good I am.

41:17.976 --> 41:22.280
But, uh, however much it is,
I owe it to you.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.917
You probably never knew
this, but I grew up

41:25.951 --> 41:27.786
wanting to be just like you.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.055
I admired you.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.524
Everybody did. They loved you,

41:32.558 --> 41:34.225
looked up to you...

41:34.259 --> 41:36.695
till they didn't.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.632
Till I didn't.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.002
Yeah?

41:44.035 --> 41:46.204
When was that?

41:46.237 --> 41:48.239
Today.

41:49.908 --> 41:53.879
When I realized
I had to stop trying to...

41:53.912 --> 41:57.616
make up for all the damage
you've done,

41:57.649 --> 41:59.651
for all the people you hurt.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.190
Took me long enough.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.225
But here I am.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.831
Looks like we're both free now.
