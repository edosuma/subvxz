01:30.007 --> 01:33.843
It may not look like much now
but wait till you see Poseidonis in 3D.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.596
- With Aquaman riding Storm.
- What's Storm?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.973
That's his animatronic seahorse.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.893
Amazing.
Eventually you won't even need actors, right?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.811
In five years we won't.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.898
Kidding.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.858
You still mad at me for bailing on dinner?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
I'm not mad at you.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.112
- So what's wrong?
- Who says there's anything wrong?

01:53.197 --> 01:55.114
I know you. I can tell.

01:55.199 --> 01:58.034
Vince, you haven't known me
in like five years.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.204
True. You've probably changed a lot.
I've changed a lot. I learned French.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.915
I didn't know these two had a history.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.666
It's nothing.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.252
Even if something was wrong,
I think it's egotistical

02:08.336 --> 02:10.545
that you just assume it's about you.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.590
That's right. I mean, you're right.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.343
But I'm right, too.
There is something wrong. So what is it?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.512
Nothing.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.347
I don't want to talk about it with you.

02:19.431 --> 02:22.850
We're gonna be up here for a while,
we might as well talk about something.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.686
I had a fight with Chris.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.897
I don't want to talk about that.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.442
Vince, how are we ever going
to make this movie together?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.319
They're gonna make this movie together

02:33.403 --> 02:36.280
because between them
they're making $8 million.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.033
Fucking actors,
they never know when they're miked.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.911
It was weird, on True Lies

02:41.995 --> 02:45.581
it was Tom Arnold that said
he was gonna be governor.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.667
Excuse me, Mr. Cameron.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.210
- Yeah?
- Ron's on the phone.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.421
There seems to be a small
problem with the hovercraft.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.298
What is it?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.176
- It won't hover.
- God damn it.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.761
Gary?

02:59.221 --> 03:01.472
I hope these two are not
going to be a fucking problem, Eric.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.182
Go ahead, Jim.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.643
Gary, I need you
at the hovercraft right now, over.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.061
Flying in.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.858
What happened with you and Chris?
I want to know.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.319
We're having communication issues.
We had those.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.488
- You got to be more up front.
- Oh, really?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.784
If we're talking about
someone who's never been up front,

03:21.869 --> 03:24.036
we should be talking about you.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.290
- What?
- Well, I'm going to be up front now.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.501
I'm not over you.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.881
And I haven't gotten over you.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.468
How's that for up front?

03:40.137 --> 03:42.179
We are so fucked.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.183
So first you tell me your relationship
with this girl was meaningless.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.185
Then I find out that you proposed to her.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.813
Then you tell me you haven't
thought about her in five years

03:50.898 --> 03:52.940
when, as sick as it is,
you're still in love with her.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.734
How can I trust anything you say anymore?

03:54.818 --> 03:57.403
How can I trust you?
You're the one eavesdropping.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.906
Should have Gavin de Becker
come sweep the house for bugs.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.699
You know what? This is a bad situation.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.826
You know what, E? There's is no situation.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.954
Mandy is engaged.
You're acting like an obsessed schoolgirl.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.916
E, do me a favor.
Manage my career, not my relationships.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.876
This is your career. And mine too, all right?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.920
In front of James Cameron, stop lying to me.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.005
I don't want to talk about this
in front of the guys. I'm serious.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.759
Vince, Armani doesn't have
a suit for under two grand.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.344
Don't worry, it's all on me.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.054
Seriously, do we need to wear suits?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.681
What else are you going to wear
to a bat mitzvah? A Knick jersey?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.391
It's formal. I was thinking home whites.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.393
How come you're not trying anything on?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.479
I don't let other men buy my clothes, Drama.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.689
And I'm not paying two grand
for a suit myself.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.858
Wear the suit you wore
for your high school graduation.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.526
It's hanging in your closet.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.362
I thought that was his communion suit.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.198
E didn't grow much from communion
to high school graduation.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.699
It's probably the same suit.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.284
Fuck you guys.
I'm going to Men's Warehouse.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.245
Oh, come on, E.
I think you can afford a nice suit.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.873
Don't be such a chaza, huh.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.959
I'm brushing up on my Hebrew for the affair.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.961
Chaza means greedy, Drama, not cheap.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.755
- How do you know?
- E used to valet park at Ohav Shalom.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.841
That's great, Drama.
Now you're illiterate in two languages.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.927
Let's hit shoes.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.804
Men's Warehouse?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.556
Don't start.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.226
What do you think, red or blue?

05:10.310 --> 05:13.479
The red's a little flashy for
a bat mitzvah, Vince. I like the blue.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.941
Okay. How did you know we were
going to a bat mitzvah?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.859
- You don't remember me?
- Sloan.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.861
- Sloan McQuewick, right?
- That's right.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.822
Good memory. Eric, right?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.448
Yeah, good memory, too.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.993
This is Terrance's daughter.
Terrance is Ari's boss.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.454
- Ari's partner.
- That's right. Now I remember.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.165
- Do you?
- No, not really.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.875
I'm sorry, how did we meet?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.795
The Christmas party, last year.
You were going to Italy, right?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.381
That's right.
You were thinking about getting engaged.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.383
- What?
- We had a couple drinks.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.468
More than a couple, I think.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.012
I take it you didn't then.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.847
Oh, no. We broke up.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.268
So, will I be seeing you both at Ari's party?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.229
Yeah.
- Great. We'll have fun.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.274
- See ya.
Nice to meet you again.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.860
Well, Vince, what else
can we do for you today?

06:00.944 --> 06:02.528
I'm just going to look at
some more ties and that's it.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.779
Great.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.948
Know what, Philip?
I think I'm going to buy myself a new suit.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.785
What? She's not engaged.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.330
Don't even think about
not picking that up, Ray,

06:13.415 --> 06:16.250
- 'cause I'll fucking kill you.
- Fuck you, Ari.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.142
Fabulous, baby. Fabulous.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.397
Hey, is it me

06:38.482 --> 06:39.899
- or is her voice getting worse?
- Ari!

06:39.983 --> 06:42.777
Doesn't mean that I don't love her,
but she's just awful, baby.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.904
Hey, kids. Whose car's out front?

06:44.988 --> 06:46.906
Terrance. He's waiting for you out back.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.241
Terrance is here? Why's he here?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.285
I don't know. Why don't you find out?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.871
Ari, what are you freaking out about?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.874
Guy lives three blocks from us
and hasn't been by in five years.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.377
Now he shows up four hours before we're
supposed to see him. Something's up.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.213
- Ari.
- What?

07:02.297 --> 07:04.965
You're a partner now.
You don't need to be afraid of him anymore.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.760
I'm afraid of him? I'll beat that
old fuck and throw him in the pool.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.762
Only Daddy speaks that way.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.474
Out.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.605
- There he is.
- Ari!

07:19.689 --> 07:21.398
Terrance, what a pleasant surprise.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.484
- Nice to see you, mate.
- Nice to see you.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.236
Sweaty.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.404
Well, I'm looking forward to this evening.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.281
Yeah, well, it should be fun, huh?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.867
Cost me enough, it better be.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.953
I hope you're not going to try and expense

07:34.037 --> 07:35.955
any of this bat mitzvah to the agency.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.540
Me?

07:38.542 --> 07:42.378
Ah, so little Sarah becomes a woman tonight.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.046
Yeah.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.881
Time flies. Incredible, isn't it?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.550
It seems like only yesterday

07:47.634 --> 07:50.219
that my Sloan was running around
in pigtails and braces.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.637
- Amazing.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.347
You know, speaking of Sloan,

07:53.431 --> 07:57.309
she mentioned that she ran into
Vincent Chase in Beverly Hills.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.020
You know, she can't stop
raving about this guy.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.399
She thinks he's gonna be a giant movie star.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.651
I've been saying that for five years.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.653
Yes, but Sloan is never wrong.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.572
You know, she saw Johnny Depp

08:09.656 --> 08:11.740
in Platoon when she was eight years old

08:11.825 --> 08:14.618
and she said, "Dad, that's the guy to watch. "

08:14.703 --> 08:16.912
You showed her Platoon
when she was eight years old?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.999
Oliver did. He wanted feedback.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.334
Listen, the reason for my visit is

08:22.419 --> 08:25.337
I'd like a little chat with Mr. Chase tonight.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.006
I'd like to see into his head,

08:27.090 --> 08:30.217
find out what his hopes and his dreams are.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.136
We've had that talk dozens of times,

08:33.221 --> 08:35.097
and I could tell you firsthand...

08:35.182 --> 08:38.183
No, firsthand would be him telling me.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.102
Yeah.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.647
So listen, why don't you give me

08:43.732 --> 08:45.774
a proper introduction tonight, huh?

08:45.859 --> 08:49.862
- I mean, make an old man happy.
- Yeah.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.615
Oh, listen,

08:53.950 --> 08:57.286
- this is for the little lady.
- Oh.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.497
I didn't want my gift to get
mixed up with all the others.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.917
Huh?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.633
Would you stop?

09:10.717 --> 09:13.302
- You're gonna spoil your appetite.
- You're not my mother.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.054
If I'm not eating, you're not eating.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.430
I'm fucking starving!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.474
Do you know how much food
is gonna be at this thing?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.351
You eating right now would be like jerking off

09:20.435 --> 09:21.894
an hour before fucking a supermodel.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.230
If I was fucking a supermodel, I would jerk off.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.023
That way I can go all night.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.567
- You guys ready for a big night?
- You sure Ari wants us there?

09:28.652 --> 09:31.070
Of course he does, Turtle.
Ari looks at us as family.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.822
Then why doesn't he represent me?

09:34.699 --> 09:37.243
Oh, hey! Look at this guy!

09:37.327 --> 09:40.579
$3,000 suit just to line up
some pussy, huh, E?

09:40.664 --> 09:44.375
It's a good investment.
McQuewick's gotta be worth 100 million easy.

09:44.459 --> 09:48.128
You buying that suit is like
buying Microsoft in the '80s.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.005
That's if you can get the girl.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.758
- I just needed a new suit, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.635
- What about the hair?
- What about it?

09:54.719 --> 09:57.638
- A little shiny.
- Mangoes.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.473
Don't smell me.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.600
Looks like we're headed
for another E romance novel.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.269
Get your tissues ready, guys.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.229
Seriously, if this one breaks your heart,

10:05.313 --> 10:07.439
just kill yourself
so we don't have to hear about it.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.857
I'll have the Barry Manilow CD ready for you.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.735
- Fuck you guys.
- What are you so sensitive about?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.696
We know you well enough
to know you're in for trouble.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.532
Yeah? How well do we know you, Vince?

10:16.992 --> 10:18.284
What does that mean?

10:18.368 --> 10:19.994
Yeah, why are you going off on Vince for?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.412
No reason.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.665
All right, what's up?
- Nothing.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.210
I didn't want to waste a Saturday night
on a bat mitzvah anyway.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.963
You guys don't wanna
tell me what's up, I ain't going.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.798
- Me neither.
- Ask Vince.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.217
I told you I didn't want
to talk about it in front of them.

10:36.011 --> 10:39.263
Them? Since when are we them?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.640
Next thing you know,
E's gonna be his brother.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.350
You're a fuckin' dick.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.439
Fine. Tell 'em.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.025
Vince isn't over Mandy. He never has been.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.485
- He's been lying all along.
- What are you talking about?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.238
He told her he loved her today
in front of James fucking Cameron.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.699
- I didn't use those words.
I thought she was getting married.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.659
- Great Mother of God.
- This is why

11:00.744 --> 11:02.828
we told you to get her off the movie, E!

11:02.912 --> 11:05.664
Yeah, E, if this movie
gets fucked up, it's on you.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.000
No, look, nothing's getting fucked up, okay?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.753
I am fine. I am just living my life.

11:10.837 --> 11:14.631
You know, in fact, I was planning
on living my life again tonight

11:14.716 --> 11:16.550
till you decided to stake your claim with Sloan

11:16.634 --> 11:18.552
with your new suit and your fruity new hair.

11:18.636 --> 11:19.678
What?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.805
We all know how you like
to fall in love at the drop of a hat.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.016
Did you ever think that maybe
I was interested, too?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.977
What are you talking...
You didn't even remember who she was.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.564
Don't worry, E. You spoke up first.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.941
It's okay. I'll step down.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.947
I don't need you to back off.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.075
Oh, E, don't wake a sleeping giant.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.869
Seriously, E.
Take the offer while it's hot on the table.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.371
I had a connection with this girl.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.206
So what, she's just gonna flip to Vince?

11:47.290 --> 11:49.041
You have a 25-mile lead in the marathon.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.085
Once Vince laces up his shoes, it's over.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.046
At least if he bangs Sloan,
he'll get over his obsession with Mandy.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.715
It might be worth the sacrifice
to save the movie.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.259
Look, Vince, if you wanna
go for her, go for her.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.220
Okay, fine, I will.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.806
You don't scare me, you famous fuck.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.894
Good move, E.
You're gonna need all your facilities.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.938
My what, idiot?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.816
Did I say that wrong?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.994
Mazel tov.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.916
Congratulations. You look beautiful.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.340
Look at Terrance. I guarantee you
his relatives worked with Nazis.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.760
- Ari, compose yourself.
- Compose myself? You hate Melinda, too.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.180
- Quiet. I don't hate anybody.
- Mazel tov, Ari.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.683
Hello, darling. You look great! Beautiful.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.602
- Thank you.
- Hey, princess!

12:50.687 --> 12:52.980
- Melinda, it's so great to see you.
- You too!

12:53.064 --> 12:55.023
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.443
Being a housewife certainly agrees with you.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.821
Playing a raging bitch on TV certainly
agrees with you. You're so natural.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.450
If you hadn't quit acting at 25
it might have been you on a hit TV show.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.872
- Honey, I need a drink.
- I think I need a drink, too.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.458
Hey, I'm looking forward
to my sit down with our boy.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.961
"Sit down. "

13:16.045 --> 13:18.964
That schnitzel-loving
fuck is trying to steal Vince. Hi.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.258
- Nice to see you. Welcome.
Hello.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.594
Speaking of Vince,
why did he bring three dates?

13:23.678 --> 13:25.137
ARl: That's the way it comes, a package deal.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.638
Where am I gonna sit them?

13:26.723 --> 13:28.307
I already talked to the caterer. Hi.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.642
Everything's taken care of.
Don't worry about it.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.146
Why are me and Drama sitting at table 19
and you guys are sitting at table six?

13:34.230 --> 13:37.900
Relax, Turtle. Ari probably just
wants to spread out the celebs.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.444
Not to mention I haven't seen
a single edible item since we got here.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.654
We just passed a sushi bar right there, Turtle.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.824
- Cooked items, E.
- The yellowtail is amazing.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.827
Patience, Turtle.
- Hey, you boys missed temple.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.662
We thought that was for Jews only.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.166
Hi, Vince. Thanks so much
for coming to my bat mitzvah.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.959
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.795
- Look at you. You look beautiful.
- Thanks, so do you.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.924
You look great, too, E. What'd you do,
raid the boys' department at Macy's?

14:02.008 --> 14:04.885
You look pretty good, too.
You auditioning for Guys and Dolls?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.513
Hey, boys, enjoy yourselves.
Tonight we eat like kings.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.765
- 500 a head.
- I'm starving.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.808
- I told you.
- Smoke more weed, Turtle.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.810
Seriously, smoke more weed.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.734
She is pretty, huh?

14:20.818 --> 14:21.860
Ivy Leaguer, too?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.570
I thought you didn't remember
anything about her.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.572
Things are starting to come back.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.616
I think I'm gonna ask her to dance.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.327
- Oh, unless, of course, you wanna...
- Fuck you.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.870
Oh, I forgot, you don't dance.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.581
Great, you get a leg up on me
because you've been training

14:34.666 --> 14:37.376
for the Saturday Night Fever
remake for the last 20 years.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.336
I don't understand what you do
at these things if you don't dance.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.380
- Why're you doing this?
- Why'd you tell the guys about Mandy

14:41.464 --> 14:44.132
- when I asked you not to?
- So what is this, payback?

14:45.593 --> 14:47.761
- I'm heading over.
- I'm heading over with you.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.481
So what show did you say you were on again?

15:00.817 --> 15:03.151
Viking Quest.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.071
What did he say?

15:09.659 --> 15:12.536
Excuse me, honey. What time's dinner?
We're starving.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.913
Didn't you eat all the appetizers after temple?

15:14.998 --> 15:16.373
No, we missed temple.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.001
Sinners. It's going to be a while.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.754
I wanna kill you, Drama.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.673
So what exactly were you doing in Italy?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.759
A friend was opening a restaurant
and I kinda helped her manage it.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.261
God, what a coincidence.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.887
E used to manage an Italian restaurant also.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.180
Really?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.433
- Well, yeah...
Don't be embarrassed.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.893
It was the biggest Sbarro's
in all of Kew Gardens.

15:36.978 --> 15:40.522
I love Sbarro's. I go to the one
at the Beverly Center all the time.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.233
- Great sauce, right?
- Yeah.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.278
Hey, Vince, my dad is dying
to get a word in with you.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.614
- Would you mind if I went to get him?
- By all means.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.449
Okay, I'll be right back.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.286
Already wants me to meet the family.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.204
You're seriously starting to annoy me.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.707
ARl: Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.584
Excuse me, could I get your attention?

16:00.668 --> 16:03.587
Before I bring up the special family members

16:03.671 --> 16:06.006
for the lighting of the candle ceremony,

16:06.090 --> 16:10.010
I would love to say a couple things
about this little girl right here.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.846
You know, when she was born

16:12.930 --> 16:14.973
I have to be honest, I wanted a boy.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.975
Easy!

16:17.060 --> 16:18.977
Wait a minute. Give me a break here.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.064
Now I didn't have any sisters
and I didn't know what to expect.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.652
But this little girl changed my life.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.195
And,

16:28.279 --> 16:30.697
watching her blossom into a woman

16:31.324 --> 16:34.409
has been one of the most remarkable things

16:34.494 --> 16:36.995
that I have ever seen.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.291
And from the time she could walk

16:41.376 --> 16:44.002
she would come into our room
and she would jump on our bed

16:44.087 --> 16:46.213
and she would wake us up
and we couldn't sleep.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.132
- I'd get about two hours of sleep...
- Vince, this is my father.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.425
- Hello.
Nice to see you.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.386
And this is his wife Melinda Clark.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.012
- Hi.
Hello.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.014
- And, Daddy, this is Eric Murphy.
- Ah.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.725
When was the last time we saw each other?

16:58.810 --> 17:01.895
Oh, it's been a while.
I think since the Christmas party last year.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.897
Oh, that's right. That's right.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.773
We should let them get acquainted.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.776
- You wanna get a drink?
- Yeah.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.820
- We'll be at the bar.
So, Vince, I have to say,

17:10.905 --> 17:14.907
I finally saw Head On.
I just have to say it was fabulous.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.952
- Simply fabulous.
- Yeah.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.539
We finally found her asleep under our bed.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.458
And she didn't wake us.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.921
But she wanted to be near us.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.465
And I hope that she always will.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.642
Now, I would love to invite

17:40.727 --> 17:43.019
some of the family members...
Who's coming up now?

17:43.104 --> 17:45.355
- Grandpa Manny. We've got cousin...
- Grandpa Manny,

17:45.440 --> 17:47.149
or as Sara likes to call him "Munchie,"

17:47.233 --> 17:49.401
I would love to come up here.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.070
He's that special,

17:52.155 --> 17:54.573
special breed of grandfather...

17:54.657 --> 17:56.575
You know what? A better idea I think

17:56.659 --> 17:59.578
would be to bring up Sarah's star crush,

17:59.662 --> 18:02.414
Vinnie Chase, to cut the challah.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.375
Everybody put it together for Vinnie Chase.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.922
- Ari, what the hell are you doing?
- Vinnie Chase!

18:11.007 --> 18:13.008
Come on up and cut the challah.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.809
Look at that gorgeous piece of bread.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.813
It's like a big baked cloud.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.192
Imagine making
a six-foot hero out of that thing.

18:30.735 --> 18:34.905
A little mortadella,
some gabagool, provolone.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.829
Let's get this party started, huh? DJ Quik.
Everybody dance.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.332
What about the blessing
and the lighting of the candles?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.417
What more boring way to kill
a party than to get 30 people up here

18:47.502 --> 18:49.127
and light a fucking candle?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.638
Thank God.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.267
What did you guys order?

19:04.352 --> 19:07.270
We didn't order anything. We were late.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.607
- But we'll take whatever you've got.
- Well,

19:10.691 --> 19:12.651
what I got is

19:12.735 --> 19:14.903
two kosher vegetarians.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.614
Do you need some salt?

19:18.908 --> 19:21.284
Excuse me, sir.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.037
I will give you $100 for that prime rib.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.082
What'd he say?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.920
Oh, I love this song.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.089
Do you want to dance?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.466
Oh, you know what? I don't dance.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.593
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.804
No, not for you. People will be looking at you.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.139
- It'll be horrifying, trust me.
- What's up, kids?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.725
- You guys having a good time?
- Well, we were,

19:45.810 --> 19:47.853
but Eric here refuses to dance with me.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.312
Really? Why?

19:49.397 --> 19:52.482
Well, he says he doesn't like to dance.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.318
Since when? E, come on,
you used to love to dance as a child.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.947
You know what? He's a little insecure.
I'll talk to him.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.955
Okay, fine. I did lie about the past.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.790
But I really believed I was over her.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.626
And then I saw her and I realized
I wasn't. What do you want me to do?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.295
Get over her. Go make the movie.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.714
This coming from
my manager or my best friend?

20:15.798 --> 20:19.217
Both. Look, she's in love with someone else.
She's getting married.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.803
Thanks, buddy.

20:22.597 --> 20:23.972
Hey, Sloan.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.308
E wants you to dance with me

20:26.392 --> 20:28.643
so we can teach him a couple moves.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.729
We'll be back later.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.702
Shalom aleichem.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.288
That's Hebrew for
"What time do you get off tonight?"

20:48.372 --> 20:49.831
Cute.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.625
Ignore his inappropriate sexual advances.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.710
We're looking for one thing, meat.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.211
How stoned are you guys?

20:55.296 --> 20:57.088
- What?
- No.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.090
I know exactly what you need.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.717
Come on, boys.

21:27.954 --> 21:31.122
Unbelievable.
He's pimping his own daughter out.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.959
Sarah, come here, baby. Angel, come here.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.586
- Stop it, Ari.
- Honey, go get your star crush.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.546
- Go ask him to dance right now.
- Shut up, Daddy!

21:38.631 --> 21:40.507
- You're so embarrassing me.
- "Shut up, Daddy. "

21:40.591 --> 21:42.467
She's really a woman now.
I have to get used to it.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.219
- You are being ridiculous.
- I'm being...

21:44.303 --> 21:46.805
That's exactly what you said
at the Bill and Ted premiere

21:46.889 --> 21:50.225
when Terrance said, "I'll take Keanu,
you take the other guy. "

21:50.309 --> 21:53.478
Ari, you've idolized Terrance
since you were 20 years old

21:53.562 --> 21:55.897
and you've let him take
advantage of you ever since.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.441
So stop it now.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.735
You're right, baby.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.655
- Just be a man.
- "Just be a man. " Really?

22:03.739 --> 22:05.740
You give me the whole
heartfelt pump-up speech

22:05.825 --> 22:08.326
and then you say just go be a man? Come on.

22:20.589 --> 22:26.094
I need to speak to you.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.514
- I'm dancing with my wife.
- Now.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.517
Excuse me, darling.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.519
This better be good.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.200
- Where's my joint?
- Where's the goods?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.493
Turn to your right.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.456
A kids' buffet? Sweet!

22:55.499 --> 22:57.542
- Thank you.
We got hot dogs,

22:57.626 --> 23:00.295
and chicken and pizza.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.091
Mac and cheese, baby!

23:06.052 --> 23:08.094
Vince is my client.

23:08.179 --> 23:11.347
I took him from nothing, all right?

23:11.432 --> 23:14.350
And now he is on the cusp. I ain't sharin' him.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.937
You know, when I started
this company in 1971,

23:18.022 --> 23:20.482
my mantra was, "Every client

23:20.566 --> 23:23.526
"should be represented by
every agent in the building. "

23:23.611 --> 23:26.821
And, yes, all right,
technically, he is your client.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.618
- But this is my agency.
- And I'm a fucking partner.

23:31.702 --> 23:35.080
Well, I've had more than a few partners.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.082
Not all of them have lasted.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.918
Enjoy your evening.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.719
Good living, huh, kids?

23:49.804 --> 23:50.929
No doubt.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.723
You got a light?

23:53.808 --> 23:56.768
You've gotta be kidding me.
Turtle, look at this kid.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.604
Jesus Christ!
What, are you 13 and you're getting high?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.523
You're not gonna give us a lecture, are you?

24:01.607 --> 24:04.442
No, not a lecture, a life lesson.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.153
We know. You're talking to former addicts.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.280
Weed is a gateway drug, son.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.951
One day you're lighting up in full view
of a dozen adults at a bat mitzvah,

24:13.035 --> 24:15.662
the next you're cruising
Santa Monica Boulevard

24:15.746 --> 24:17.747
offering hand jobs for a crack rock.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.499
Which one of you did that?

24:22.378 --> 24:23.920
Just put the joint down, kid.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.547
Just give me a light, old man,

24:25.631 --> 24:27.715
or I'll tell my dad
you put your hand on my knee.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.640
Enough about Mandy.
What's the deal with your friend Eric?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.267
Eric? I mean, Eric's the best.

24:37.351 --> 24:40.562
He's got good values, smart, loyal.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.482
I highly recommend him, although
right now he's probably mad at me

24:44.567 --> 24:45.775
because he thinks I'm out here working you.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.318
What, you didn't tell him

24:47.444 --> 24:50.113
- I don't date actors?
- How would I know that?

24:50.197 --> 24:53.283
I told you that at the Christmas party
when you were working me.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.243
Really? Was I?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.703
Come on.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.789
Hello?

24:59.874 --> 25:01.916
Cheer up, E. It's a celebration.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.085
- Where's Vince?
- He disappeared with Sloan.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.795
Probably at the tennis courts.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.173
I hear that's where you fuck
at the Beverly Hilton.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.842
The fact that he went after
this girl purely out of spite,

25:10.926 --> 25:13.553
- I may never speak to him again.
- Don't be so overly sensitive.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.805
It's like getting mad at the bull
for giving you the horns

25:15.890 --> 25:18.141
when you shouldn't have been
in the ring in the first place.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.685
- Fuck you guys for encouraging him.
- Come on, Turtle,

25:20.769 --> 25:22.979
- let's go work the waitress staff.
- No, fuck that.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.023
They just wheeled out the dessert cart.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.066
Do-it-yourself sundaes? Oh, man.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.401
Sprinkles.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.826
- Hey.
- Hey!

25:37.369 --> 25:38.494
Where's Vince?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.955
Oh, he got a phone call
from Mandy and he left.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.833
- You're kidding me.
- He said you'd react that way.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.668
But you gotta stop worrying about him.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.629
What else did he say?

25:47.796 --> 25:50.131
He said that you're a great guy

25:50.216 --> 25:53.092
and that you've been
his best friend his whole life,

25:53.177 --> 25:56.012
and that I should just drag you
onto the dance floor.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.725
Come on, it's a slow song.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.878
I was a little surprised that you called.
What's going on?

26:30.130 --> 26:32.757
I wanted to tell you

26:32.841 --> 26:34.968
that Chris and I are gonna
be taking a little break.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.428
Aw, that's too bad.

26:37.513 --> 26:40.723
Look, you know, if you need a friend,
of course I'll be there...

26:40.808 --> 26:43.601
Vince, I have enough friends.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.230
The truth is, if we're being
up front with one another,

26:49.024 --> 26:50.650
I'm not over you either.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.361
- Really?
- Really.

26:56.365 --> 26:59.867
You wanna go get
a cup of coffee and talk about it?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.551
Is that Vince?

27:16.635 --> 27:17.885
Is that Mandy?

27:18.305 --> 27:24.908
