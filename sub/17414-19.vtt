WEBVTT

00:08.468 --> 00:09.933
Chuck! Get back here!

00:09.934 --> 00:12.568
Mom is going to be so mad!

00:12.633 --> 00:14.467
Dad, help!

00:14.468 --> 00:15.999
I'm working, Charles!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.534
Uh...

00:18.600 --> 00:21.034
she's gonna
hurt me.

00:23.167 --> 00:25.267
What's going on out here?
I'm trying to work.

00:25.334 --> 00:27.367
Chuck broke Mom's
favorite necklace.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.867
Is that true, Charles?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.233
I didn't mean to.

00:37.234 --> 00:38.433
Ha!

00:38.434 --> 00:39.866
He admitted it.

00:39.867 --> 00:41.033
Uh, uh. No.

00:41.034 --> 00:42.934
Let me...
Let-Let me see.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.434
Um...

00:51.267 --> 00:55.034
There's nothing broken
in-in this whole world

00:55.101 --> 00:57.067
that the two of you can't fix

00:57.134 --> 01:00.434
if you work
together.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.133
Here.

01:02.134 --> 01:03.966
Charles, go into
your sister's room

01:03.967 --> 01:05.533
and get some of
her art supplies.

01:05.534 --> 01:07.100
Go on.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.166
Ellie, you're gonna help him.

01:08.167 --> 01:09.766
I know it's hard, El,

01:09.767 --> 01:13.733
but your-your brother...

01:13.800 --> 01:15.366
does have a knack for getting

01:15.367 --> 01:17.066
into trouble.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.567
But you...

01:18.568 --> 01:21.534
You're gonna have
to protect Chuck.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.334
Be there for him
no matter what

01:24.401 --> 01:26.934
'cause you're
his big sister.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.800
Can you do that for me?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.934
Devon, I lost them.
I lost the truck!

01:39.000 --> 01:41.967
Call me as soon
as you can see them, okay?

01:43.234 --> 01:45.134
Chuck, where are you?

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.034 --> 01:55.967
Chuck, I know
how much you're hurting,

01:56.034 --> 01:58.067
but you have to know
that there is nothing

01:58.134 --> 01:59.533
that you could
have done, okay?

01:59.534 --> 02:01.568
It's not your fault.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.568
Yes, it is.

02:03.633 --> 02:06.834
I'm the one who downloaded
the Intersect 2.0.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.201
I'm the one
who chose to be a spy,

02:09.267 --> 02:11.234
and it's him who paid the price.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.000
So who's gonna get us out
of this one?

02:18.067 --> 02:21.334
Who even knows we're here?

02:26.134 --> 02:27.799
Okay, babe.
We found him.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.133
Devon, these people killed
my father.

02:29.134 --> 02:30.933
They're gonna do the same thing
to Chuck.

02:30.934 --> 02:32.533
You have to stop them, okay?

02:32.534 --> 02:34.400
I know. I know.

02:34.401 --> 02:36.133
We're on it.

02:36.134 --> 02:37.366
What are we gonna do?

02:37.367 --> 02:38.500
We don't have a plan.

02:38.501 --> 02:39.833
No plan?

02:39.834 --> 02:41.734
Never stopped me before.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.867
Everybody good? Comfy?

02:59.067 --> 03:01.468
Uncuff yourselves.

03:01.534 --> 03:02.866
It should look like

03:02.867 --> 03:04.400
you were trying to escape
when I kill you.

03:04.401 --> 03:07.167
<i>Gee, Morgan,</i>

03:07.234 --> 03:09.767
I think that when one is facing
a group of murderers,

03:09.834 --> 03:11.266
one should have a plan.

03:11.267 --> 03:12.833
Okay, I agree with you

03:12.834 --> 03:14.233
in principle, but we're
here now, all right?

03:14.234 --> 03:16.234
What would you like me to do,
open up the glove box?

03:16.301 --> 03:17.533
Pull up the spy manual?
Maybe just...?

03:17.534 --> 03:19.468
This is Casey's car.

03:19.534 --> 03:21.434
Glove box.
Glove box.

03:23.034 --> 03:25.367
Whoa.

03:25.434 --> 03:26.666
Get to it.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.933
Don't look at me.
I'm a doctor.

03:27.934 --> 03:29.333
I can't use this.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.200
Easy, will you?

03:31.201 --> 03:32.732
I'm a lapsed
vegetarian. I...

03:32.733 --> 03:33.933
Here...

03:33.934 --> 03:36.201
Here's a button.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.966
Whoa.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.467
What did you just do?

03:39.468 --> 03:41.100
I hit... I hit a button...

03:41.101 --> 03:42.833
Yeah, well, un... unhit it.
What's wrong with you? Hey! Hey!

03:42.834 --> 03:44.333
You just push any button
you see? You're like...

03:44.334 --> 03:45.533
How many missions
have you been on?

03:45.534 --> 03:47.434
How many missions
have you been...?

03:59.934 --> 04:02.334
Chuck?

04:02.401 --> 04:03.632
Are you okay?

04:03.633 --> 04:05.500
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

04:05.501 --> 04:07.401
Everyone okay?

04:09.067 --> 04:10.967
We're here to save you.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.000
Hey, you used my missile.

04:31.067 --> 04:32.133
Pretty cool, huh?

04:32.134 --> 04:34.034
Yell at me later.
Let's go.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.500
Chuck. Come on.
Get in the car.

04:47.501 --> 04:49.867
Come on.
Get in the car.

04:49.934 --> 04:52.667
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it!

05:32.834 --> 05:35.000
<i>You're gonna have
to protect Chuck.</i>

05:35.067 --> 05:37.967
Be there for him
no matter what,

05:38.034 --> 05:41.034
'cause you're
his big sister.

05:41.101 --> 05:43.800
Can you do that for me?

05:45.667 --> 05:47.600
Yeah.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.568
<i>Okay, Dad, I promise.</i>

05:49.569 --> 05:52.529
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

05:56.734 --> 05:57.899
Look, by now, Shaw's alerted
the Ring of our escape.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.000
They'll be looking
for us.

05:59.001 --> 06:00.266
What do we do now?

06:00.267 --> 06:01.699
If there's one thing
I learned from my dad,

06:01.700 --> 06:03.133
it's that we have to be smart.

06:03.134 --> 06:05.201
We have to do what he would
have done. We need to disappear.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.933
Yeah. Give up
our old lives.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.400
Drop off
the grid.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.301
Okay, so we're in agreement
then. That's the plan.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.236
Wait. I'm sorry.
That's the plan?

06:12.271 --> 06:13.499
We give up our lives?

06:13.500 --> 06:14.966
Babe, it's the best
for all of us.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.400
Devon, what are you
talking about?

06:16.401 --> 06:17.566
This is not us.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.800
We don't live
off grids, okay?

06:19.867 --> 06:21.934
We are regular people.
We live on planet Earth,

06:22.001 --> 06:23.901
and my father was murdered
today.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.434
Our father, Chuck.

06:30.401 --> 06:32.233
I'm calling the police.
It's what regular people do.

06:32.234 --> 06:34.567
No. Hey, no calls.

06:34.633 --> 06:35.632
They'll track 'em.

06:35.633 --> 06:36.632
This is insane.

06:36.633 --> 06:37.833
I'm going.

06:37.834 --> 06:39.734
Sis, wait!

06:41.734 --> 06:43.532
Get out of the car, Chuck!

06:43.533 --> 06:44.866
Can we talk about this
for a second?

06:44.867 --> 06:46.066
What's happening?

06:46.067 --> 06:48.034
Is my husband safe
with you?

06:48.101 --> 06:51.034
Um... yeah. Why?

06:51.101 --> 06:53.334
Because Chuck
and I need to talk.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.532
Hmm. Two Bartowskis.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.433
Double the fun.

07:02.201 --> 07:04.700
Hello, egg white omelet
on English muffin

07:04.767 --> 07:06.667
with my favorite
banana peppers to boot.

07:06.702 --> 07:10.468
160 calories of deliciousness.

07:10.533 --> 07:13.767
I do know how
to build a better breakfast.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.368
Mmm!

07:30.900 --> 07:32.900
Talk to me, Moses.

07:34.867 --> 07:36.767
Anyone seen Morgan?

07:36.802 --> 07:37.766
Chuck around?

07:37.767 --> 07:39.100
Tell me John's in the john.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.100
Can we help you, sir?

07:40.101 --> 07:41.367
I need my assistant managers

07:41.368 --> 07:42.566
and Chuck.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.100
Hey, what we lack profoundly

07:44.101 --> 07:46.267
and proudly
in on-the-job competence,

07:46.334 --> 07:49.034
we more than make up for
with listening skills.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.301
Actually, I'm deaf
in my left ear,

07:51.368 --> 07:53.066
except for a faint ringing.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.967
Psst.

07:55.468 --> 07:57.233
It's big news, boys.

07:57.234 --> 07:58.467
The store's numbers are down.

07:58.468 --> 08:00.066
Mm. My main man Moses,

08:00.067 --> 08:01.967
founder of the Buy More
himself, called.

08:02.002 --> 08:04.018
Said if we don't see
a spike in numbers

08:04.053 --> 08:06.034
and fast, they're gonna
close the store.

08:06.101 --> 08:08.001
What?! Factoring Jeffrey out

08:08.034 --> 08:09.499
of the conversation
for a minute,

08:09.500 --> 08:10.966
may I propose something

08:10.967 --> 08:12.900
that I rarely do
in life myself?

08:14.401 --> 08:17.101
Tell... the... truth.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.400
What you talking about, Lester?

08:18.401 --> 08:20.700
Well, if in fact, we are
going out of business,

08:20.767 --> 08:23.101
why not just tell that to
our most loyal customers?

08:23.167 --> 08:25.867
You mean have
a going out of business sale.

08:25.934 --> 08:27.532
Slash the prices.

08:27.533 --> 08:30.533
Sell everything
to juice the books.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.799
That's crazy!

08:32.799 --> 08:37.467
Crazy...

08:37.533 --> 08:39.166
good?

08:39.167 --> 08:41.900
There may be a brain
under that mop after all.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.633
Hello.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.067
The phone did not
ring, Jeffrey.

08:48.134 --> 08:50.734
Stupid left ear.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.434
I don't understand how
you can know all this,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.468
how you can have
all these secrets...

08:57.533 --> 08:59.533
...and I'm the last
person to know.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.101
I thought that I knew you
better than anyone.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.167
Not telling you was the best way
to keep you safe.

09:05.234 --> 09:07.468
Believe me, there's no one
I wanted to tell more.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.633
I mean, you raised me, you know?

09:14.567 --> 09:16.600
Do you remember
when I broke Mom's necklace,

09:16.667 --> 09:19.267
and she left a couple days
later, and I thought,

09:19.334 --> 09:20.666
that's-that's why
she disappeared?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.233
That it was my fault?

09:22.234 --> 09:24.667
I hated her for leaving.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.967
For making you feel that way.

09:29.034 --> 09:31.834
And the way you were with Dad.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.532
No 12-year-old should
ever have to worry

09:33.533 --> 09:35.433
about handling
the family's bank account.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.834
I can't believe
that he's gone.

09:43.001 --> 09:44.899
Our crazy dad.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.301
He wasn't crazy.

09:49.633 --> 09:51.600
Our dad was a hero.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.134
He was a great man

09:54.201 --> 09:56.667
who did amazing things.

09:56.734 --> 09:59.067
He was not perfect-
not as a dad, no-

09:59.134 --> 10:01.034
but he was great.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.967
That's the secret
I most wanted you to know.

10:21.468 --> 10:23.468
What are we gonna do?

10:23.533 --> 10:25.066
We're gonna go after 'em,
and we're gonna get 'em.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.233
We're gonna take 'em down-

10:26.234 --> 10:28.234
the Ring and Shaw-
for what they did to Dad.

10:28.301 --> 10:31.001
They are not gonna
get away with this.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.967
Okay.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.799
And then you're done.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.400
What?

10:37.401 --> 10:40.401
As a spy, this-this life,
this job.

10:40.468 --> 10:42.333
Chuck, I made a promise
to protect you,

10:42.334 --> 10:44.533
and I can't do it,
not from this.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.934
So you finish it,

10:47.001 --> 10:49.101
and then you're done.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.766
Ellie, I can't...

10:50.767 --> 10:53.134
We are all that we
have left, Chuck.

10:55.201 --> 10:57.368
And I'm not gonna lose you, too.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.401
Okay.

11:03.468 --> 11:06.401
I'll get Shaw and I quit.

11:06.468 --> 11:08.434
I promise.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.533
All right,
so Devon's in the car.

11:13.534 --> 11:14.833
Sarah's making sure
it's not bugged.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.466
You remember the plan, right?
You leave the city-

11:16.467 --> 11:18.167
don't tell me where-
I don't want to know.

11:18.168 --> 11:19.399
Use only cash
and pay phones,

11:19.400 --> 11:20.866
and I will call you
when it's safe.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.299
You got that?
I got it, okay.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.299
Uh, what
about Morgan?

11:23.300 --> 11:24.533
Should I take
him with me?

11:24.534 --> 11:26.000
Funny thing about Morgan-

11:26.001 --> 11:28.300
he's, he's actually
a part of my spy team.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.667
He's helping
Casey's daughter go off-grid.

11:30.734 --> 11:31.900
Casey has a daughter?

11:31.901 --> 11:32.966
I know it's a lot
to process,

11:32.967 --> 11:34.067
but there's not enough time
right now.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.933
You have to go.

11:35.934 --> 11:37.834
Stay safe.

11:39.101 --> 11:41.001
Don't forget about your promise.

11:41.036 --> 11:43.267
I won't.

11:47.967 --> 11:50.867
Time to take down the Ring.

11:55.701 --> 11:57.299
Perimeter is set.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.299
What are you doing?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.633
Well, when Shaw grabbed me,
I noticed

11:59.634 --> 12:00.833
that the holding cells
were equipped

12:00.834 --> 12:02.399
for remote interrogation,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.567
so if I can crack
into their system, I can...

12:04.634 --> 12:07.200
Wait... There,

12:07.267 --> 12:09.567
there, right there,
there she is.

12:09.634 --> 12:10.966
It's Beckman.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.332
I'm going to open a channel.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.332
General.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.766
General!

12:14.767 --> 12:16.332
Who's there?

12:16.333 --> 12:17.332
Is that you, Shaw?

12:17.333 --> 12:18.533
No, General, this is Chuck.

12:18.534 --> 12:21.734
Chuck, thank God.

12:21.801 --> 12:22.800
Where are you?

12:22.801 --> 12:24.033
What are you doing?

12:24.034 --> 12:25.499
We're gonna take down Shaw
and the Ring,

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
but we honestly have no idea
how to do it.

12:28.767 --> 12:30.100
Listen fast.

12:30.101 --> 12:32.801
I came to Los Angeles
for the Joint Security Summit.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.901
It's a public conference
of security experts,

12:34.967 --> 12:37.134
but it's really
a secret meeting of spies.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.833
Shaw's plan was to discredit me

12:38.834 --> 12:40.633
and take my place
at the conference.

12:40.634 --> 12:44.233
Coup d'Ã©tat. The Ring is
taking over the CIA and the NSA.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.901
So if we had a plan,
that plan would be...

12:46.967 --> 12:50.834
The conference is happening
tonight at the Grand Ambassador.

12:50.901 --> 12:52.199
Wait, General, wait.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.199
Damn it.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.966
Chuck, Chuck,

12:54.967 --> 12:56.867
the five elders will be there.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.300
Hey, a-are you okay?

13:07.667 --> 13:09.332
Yeah.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.666
Yeah, sorry, yeah,

13:10.667 --> 13:12.701
just a, a lot of data.

13:12.767 --> 13:14.533
Listen, who are the elders?

13:14.534 --> 13:17.134
<i>They sound scary,
like World of Warcraft scary.</i>

13:17.200 --> 13:20.068
The elders, Morgan,
are the leaders of the Ring.

13:20.134 --> 13:21.366
Makes sense.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.500
Ring operatives were hidden
in all the major agencies.

13:23.567 --> 13:24.933
All right, that's it:
we break into the convention;

13:24.934 --> 13:26.733
we expose Shaw;
and we capture the elders.

13:26.734 --> 13:28.033
Conference will be surrounded
by an army

13:28.034 --> 13:29.100
of security agents

13:29.101 --> 13:30.167
and filled

13:30.168 --> 13:31.266
with spies.

13:31.267 --> 13:32.433
Suicide mission.
The only ones

13:32.434 --> 13:33.800
who could pull it off
would have to be

13:33.801 --> 13:35.000
the best spies in the world.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.901
Chuck, you're embarrassing me.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.866
We can do it.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.332
Yeah, well, we'd better.
It's Shaw.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.267
We don't have a choice.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.833
Yeah, let's go get some payback.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.033
Payback-
that's what I was gonna say.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.033
Definitely
get-some-payback time.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.533
<i>Okay, Chuck,</i>

13:49.534 --> 13:50.733
<i>we're going in undercover</i>

13:50.734 --> 13:52.934
<i>as members
of the Russian delegation.</i>

13:53.001 --> 13:54.499
<i>This means we need disguises.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:56.033
<i>Think you can handle that?</i>

13:56.034 --> 13:58.200
<i>Sarah, I was Perchik
in Fiddler.</i>

13:58.267 --> 14:00.167
<i>It's true. He was great.</i>

14:00.200 --> 14:02.100
<i>Thanks, buddy.</i>

14:11.701 --> 14:13.601
It's him- Shaw.

14:14.734 --> 14:15.733
Excuse me.

14:15.734 --> 14:17.232
And once
we I.D. Shaw,

14:17.233 --> 14:18.666
Casey, you, and Morgan
will take over.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.567
Okay, we're in the server room.

14:21.634 --> 14:22.966
Why'd I get Morgan for this job?

14:22.967 --> 14:25.134
Hey, hey,
I'm right here, please.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.533
Just call me after
you've cracked

14:26.534 --> 14:28.133
into the conference's
database.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.133
Okay, this is great.

14:29.134 --> 14:30.366
That's the conduit right there,

14:30.367 --> 14:32.734
so I just need a hand
getting up there.

14:34.001 --> 14:35.833
Boost.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.633
You ready?

14:37.634 --> 14:39.199
I was born rea...
well, no, actually,

14:39.200 --> 14:42.534
no, I wasn't born ready,
but I am ready now.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.934
<i>Now, remember, Chuck,</i>

14:45.001 --> 14:46.199
<i>in order for this plan to work,</i>

14:46.200 --> 14:47.433
<i>you'll need
to fully convince Shaw.</i>

14:47.434 --> 14:49.334
<i>Make eye contact,
shake his hand,</i>

14:49.400 --> 14:52.367
<i>and act
as if you were strangers.</i>

14:53.233 --> 14:55.367
Excuse me.

14:55.434 --> 14:57.334
Uh, I don't believe
we've met.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.733
Daniel Shaw.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.800
Ah, yes.

15:01.801 --> 15:02.800
Yuri Sheshenko.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.299
It is
a great pleasure

15:04.300 --> 15:05.766
to meet you,
Mr. Shaw.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.667
Well, thank you.

15:09.434 --> 15:11.133
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

15:11.134 --> 15:13.034
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

15:19.101 --> 15:20.800
Good job.

15:20.801 --> 15:24.300
Yeah, well, you can thank my
very convincing facial hair.

15:24.367 --> 15:26.267
Come on.

15:29.267 --> 15:30.800
Okay, good, good, Chuck.

15:30.801 --> 15:31.800
Number 752.

15:31.801 --> 15:34.134
Hear that? 752.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.199
One second, hold on.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.199
Okay.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.199
Let me get this thing off.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.100
Hold on one second.

15:40.567 --> 15:42.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:42.801 --> 15:45.267
Hey, little help.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.300
What is this?

15:51.300 --> 15:53.200
Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

15:53.867 --> 15:55.767
Hmm.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.934
Hi, Chuck.

16:02.001 --> 16:03.833
Shaw says your accent
could use a little work.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.000
Justin, right?

16:05.001 --> 16:06.901
You're the one
who manipulated my sister.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.399
That's right.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.434
Yeah, well, I think this is
going to hurt a little bit.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.499
Chuck? Chuck?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.800
Are you okay?

16:25.801 --> 16:27.000
Sarah.

16:27.001 --> 16:30.367
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to tell you.

16:30.434 --> 16:32.434
Can you please just tell me
what's really going on?

16:32.500 --> 16:36.400
The Intersect-
the flashes are getting worse.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.266
Okay, we have to
abort the mission.

16:38.267 --> 16:39.466
Shaw is not worth this.

16:39.467 --> 16:40.466
No, if I get
the Governor

16:40.467 --> 16:41.566
back from Shaw,
then I'll be fine,

16:41.567 --> 16:42.933
but the plan is
only gonna work

16:42.934 --> 16:44.800
if you help Morgan and Casey.
I can't leave you like this.

16:44.801 --> 16:46.499
I'm okay, really.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.599
You have to go.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.901
We have to stop him.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.667
You're not going
to believe it.

17:04.101 --> 17:08.134
There's a line around the store
of stay-at-home moms

17:08.201 --> 17:10.032
ready for the sale tomorrow.

17:10.034 --> 17:11.934
Yes.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.665
Um, Big Mike,

17:14.666 --> 17:18.067
we, uh- Jefferson and myself
were hoping to...

17:18.134 --> 17:20.034
screen this tomorrow.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.933
You know, since you're
our manager and all,

17:21.934 --> 17:24.500
we thought it'd be a good idea.
What is it?

17:24.567 --> 17:25.800
Our music video.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.000
We spent two weekends on it.

17:27.001 --> 17:28.833
Two weekends.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.867
Great idea.

17:31.934 --> 17:33.834
But let's do it late in the day.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.734
Wouldn't want to scare anyone
away too early.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.533
<i>The CIA believes
that international terrorism</i>

17:39.534 --> 17:40.900
<i>is a growth industry.</i>

17:40.901 --> 17:44.400
The demand for the security
we offer is even greater

17:44.467 --> 17:48.134
than it was a year ago, which
brings me to my next point.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.567
Excuse me.

18:00.634 --> 18:03.567
Did you know the Nerd Herd
offers a wide variety

18:03.634 --> 18:06.467
of helpful hints for making your
business presentations better?

18:06.534 --> 18:08.901
Chuck, where are you?

18:08.967 --> 18:12.101
I'm in room 752,
which I believe is your room.

18:12.168 --> 18:15.567
Also, we are well aware that
your bosses- the Ring elders-

18:15.634 --> 18:17.432
are in the audience right now...

18:17.433 --> 18:21.067
...and they have got
to be asking themselves,

18:21.134 --> 18:23.300
"Who is Daniel talking to?"

18:30.433 --> 18:32.967
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:33.034 --> 18:34.299
please remain seated.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.001
The presentation
will begin again shortly.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.201
<i>Casey, Morgan,
Shaw's left the stage.</i>

18:39.268 --> 18:40.733
Tell me everything.

18:40.734 --> 18:42.499
Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

18:42.500 --> 18:43.666
Hold on a second.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.567
Alex gave that to me
on her own free will.

18:46.367 --> 18:47.833
But as friends.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.066
Friends?
Yeah.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.800
Or something more?

18:50.801 --> 18:53.767
Your heart's racing; pupils
dilated; skin's flushed.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.066
You like her.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.333
Or you're choking me.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.733
Hey.

18:59.734 --> 19:00.699
Sarah.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.233
Oh, just in time.

19:02.234 --> 19:04.134
What for?
Come on. Let's go.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.567
Here.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.066
It's not a toy,
Morgan.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.933
Ready?
Yeah.

19:10.934 --> 19:13.967
This discussion
is not over.

19:14.034 --> 19:15.934
Muzzle down.
Yeah, muzzle down.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.167
No gun.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.034
Very brave, Chuck.

19:32.101 --> 19:33.299
So what's happening?

19:33.300 --> 19:34.566
You're under arrest.

19:34.567 --> 19:36.299
No, what are
you doing here?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.566
What's your plan?

19:37.567 --> 19:38.966
I'm sorry.
Are you asking me

19:38.967 --> 19:41.367
to make
the classic villain mistake

19:41.433 --> 19:44.534
of explaining
my dastardly plot to you?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.233
You know what?
I'd love to.

19:46.234 --> 19:48.168
I confess

19:48.234 --> 19:50.901
we had no idea who the elders
were or how to I.D. them,

19:50.967 --> 19:53.867
so we let you do that for us

19:53.934 --> 19:55.366
when you warned them
to leave the theater,

19:55.367 --> 19:57.333
so on behalf
of the NSA,

19:57.400 --> 20:00.300
the CIA, and of course
your local Buy More,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.300
I'd just like to say
thanks a lot.

20:03.901 --> 20:05.801
Hey.

20:07.168 --> 20:08.533
Going somewhere?

20:08.534 --> 20:10.667
Reach for the
sky, dirtbags.

20:10.734 --> 20:12.967
Oh, you people are the disease
and I'm the cure.

20:13.034 --> 20:15.967
Back off there, Cobra.
I didn't give you any bullets.

20:16.034 --> 20:17.133
Are you kidding me?

20:17.134 --> 20:19.034
I knew this thing
felt too light.

20:19.734 --> 20:21.934
Chuck, we've got 'em.

20:22.001 --> 20:23.566
I'm on my way up to you.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.467
Do not give Shaw an inch.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.167
Done.

20:27.168 --> 20:28.332
Ring captured.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.734
It's another check
on my to-do list.

20:30.801 --> 20:32.701
Do you see what you did wrong?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.433
You and your team
are fugitives.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.901
On whose authority
would anyone arrest me?

20:39.967 --> 20:41.934
What about my father?

20:42.001 --> 20:45.168
Yes, I killed your father.

20:45.234 --> 20:47.134
Yes, I work
for the Ring.

20:47.168 --> 20:48.900
I'm going to take down
the CIA, Chuck,

20:48.901 --> 20:52.367
and still I'm going to walk
out of here a hero.

20:52.433 --> 20:54.333
How does that make you feel?

21:02.333 --> 21:05.700
You know, your Nerd Herd
associate can also help you

21:05.801 --> 21:08.500
with videoconferencing.

21:11.534 --> 21:13.801
Smile, Daniel.

21:13.867 --> 21:16.168
You're on TV.

21:24.901 --> 21:27.001
What do I say
to that?

21:27.067 --> 21:29.700
Mwah-ha-ha.

21:31.534 --> 21:33.434
Now...

21:34.467 --> 21:36.367
Give me the Governor.

21:37.734 --> 21:39.599
Don't make me take it from you.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.700
I'd like to see you try.

21:51.801 --> 21:55.034
I knew you didn't
have it in you.

22:02.268 --> 22:04.168
So clever, so smart.

22:05.967 --> 22:07.666
There's no way out
of this one.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.466
Shaw!

22:09.467 --> 22:11.367
Drop him!

22:26.534 --> 22:28.434
Chuck?

22:29.101 --> 22:31.001
Hey.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.400
Help me.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.167
Going out of business?
What the...

22:44.267 --> 22:45.767
...hell is going on here?

22:45.768 --> 22:48.701
I've only been gone
for two days.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.199
These numbers
are amazing.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.401
Boys... you know
what time it is.

22:52.467 --> 22:53.466
Please.

22:53.467 --> 22:54.466
Say "Jeffster time."

22:54.467 --> 22:56.367
Say it. Say it.

22:59.601 --> 23:01.668
What the hell
is going on here?

23:01.734 --> 23:03.500
Who authorized this sale?

23:03.501 --> 23:04.633
This store is supposed
to be closed.

23:04.634 --> 23:05.899
These people are
stealing from us.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.300
You guys, you guys,

23:07.301 --> 23:08.733
this is not good.

23:08.734 --> 23:11.334
Old man Moses couldn't
protect us anymore.

23:11.401 --> 23:13.567
They up and closed
the store.

23:13.634 --> 23:14.899
All of this merchandise

23:14.900 --> 23:16.099
was supposed to be shipped
to Beverly Hills.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.566
Where is Mike?!

23:17.567 --> 23:19.467
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.100
Hey.

23:29.401 --> 23:30.566
Where is everyone?

23:30.567 --> 23:32.166
Casey's gone to get Ellie
and Awesome,

23:32.167 --> 23:33.832
and Morgan's checking in
to the Buy More.

23:33.833 --> 23:36.534
I promised her I'd leave.

23:36.601 --> 23:38.534
That I wouldn't be
a spy anymore.

23:38.601 --> 23:39.899
What?

23:39.900 --> 23:41.833
Ellie.

23:41.900 --> 23:44.301
She's going to be so mad at me
if I die.

23:44.367 --> 23:46.199
Hey, we're going to get
that Governor, okay?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.033
I'm going to find Shaw
and I'm going to get it back,

23:48.034 --> 23:49.934
no matter where he is.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.733
Hello?

24:36.734 --> 24:38.701
This isn't about you.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.900
Shaw.

24:40.967 --> 24:41.966
I'm in the store.

24:41.967 --> 24:43.867
I've wired it with explosives.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.367
It'll take ten minutes for
the CIA backup team to arrive.

24:47.434 --> 24:49.334
I only need seconds.

24:50.601 --> 24:52.166
I want you to send me Chuck.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.167
Now.

24:56.367 --> 24:57.700
Okay.

24:57.701 --> 25:00.067
We're on our way.

25:10.567 --> 25:12.300
<i>Help!</i>

25:12.301 --> 25:14.367
Help me! Anybody?

25:14.434 --> 25:19.234
Come on.

25:19.301 --> 25:22.034
Come... oh, no.

25:44.301 --> 25:46.867
What the hell's going on,
Morgan?

25:46.933 --> 25:48.633
Walker just pulled
the silent alarm.

25:48.634 --> 25:49.899
Yeah, it's-it's Shaw, okay.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.433
He's here and he planted
bombs all over the store

25:51.434 --> 25:53.401
<i>and he's going to blow
the whole place up.</i>

25:56.501 --> 25:58.401
Where's Chuck?

25:59.867 --> 26:01.366
<i>You got to get everyone
out of the store.</i>

26:01.367 --> 26:02.700
You anywhere near a fire alarm?

26:02.701 --> 26:03.999
Yes. It's outside the cage.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.733
But I'm-I'm-I'm tied up
inside the cage.

26:05.734 --> 26:07.600
My hands are cuffed to a chair.

26:07.601 --> 26:09.033
You got to break your thumbs,
Morgan.

26:09.034 --> 26:11.634
I'm sorry.
Can you say that again?

26:11.701 --> 26:13.033
Your thumbs.

26:13.034 --> 26:15.000
To get free,
you got to break 'em.

26:15.067 --> 26:16.333
Now! Do it!

26:16.334 --> 26:18.267
Break your thumbs.

26:18.334 --> 26:20.933
Yes, sir.

26:31.734 --> 26:33.701
You don't want to kill
all these people.

26:33.768 --> 26:35.033
You're right.

26:35.034 --> 26:36.767
I don't want to kill
all these people.

26:36.768 --> 26:39.367
However, I would like
to kill Chuck.

26:40.768 --> 26:42.668
And I wouldn't mind
killing you, too.

26:45.034 --> 26:47.601
Hey, have you seen Big Mike?

26:47.668 --> 26:49.400
We're going to need a diversion
to get out of here.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.467
What are you thinking?

26:51.534 --> 26:53.434
Pineapple.

27:07.134 --> 27:08.600
Go, go, go.

27:08.601 --> 27:11.067
Well done, Jeff.
Let's go.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.034
<i>Shaw, stop it!
You don't understand.</i>

27:37.434 --> 27:38.466
Where is he?

27:38.467 --> 27:39.966
He's not coming.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.933
He can't.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.267
A gunfight?

28:06.334 --> 28:08.267
Is that what you really want?

28:08.334 --> 28:10.301
Do you have one good flash left?

28:14.701 --> 28:16.634
Saved the best for last.

28:36.534 --> 28:39.601
* *

28:47.634 --> 28:49.534
I'm waiting, Chuck.

28:57.034 --> 28:59.933
* *

29:28.167 --> 29:31.967
* *

29:39.000 --> 29:40.900
Please, stop it, Shaw!

29:51.234 --> 29:53.134
Chuck?

29:54.034 --> 29:55.934
Chuck, please.
Chuck, please wake up.

30:04.567 --> 30:06.166
Hey, Dad...

30:06.167 --> 30:09.134
Charles, I'll be back
in a second.

30:54.967 --> 30:57.534
Chuck?

30:59.634 --> 31:01.534
Chuck, you all right?

31:01.601 --> 31:03.099
Are you all right?
Did you...?

31:03.100 --> 31:05.000
Did you...?

31:07.933 --> 31:09.799
Was a complete transfer.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.700
Empty files.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.734
The whole system went
into you. You...

31:15.800 --> 31:18.900
processed an incredible
amount of data.

31:18.967 --> 31:21.434
But you're okay.

31:22.534 --> 31:24.534
What does that mean?

31:24.601 --> 31:26.199
Hang on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.167
You're going to be okay.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.167
You're special, son.

31:32.234 --> 31:34.334
It means you're special.

31:34.401 --> 31:36.334
<i>You're special.</i>

31:36.401 --> 31:39.167
<i>You're special, son.</i>

31:39.234 --> 31:40.799
It means you're special.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.100
Please, Chuck,
come on.

31:46.167 --> 31:48.100
Shaw, stop it!

31:54.167 --> 31:56.067
Chuck?

31:57.768 --> 31:59.400
Chuck.

31:59.401 --> 32:01.634
Sorry.

32:01.701 --> 32:03.634
Just had to reboot.

32:44.234 --> 32:46.668
You have to do it.

32:48.768 --> 32:50.668
You have to kill me.

32:54.634 --> 32:56.534
No, thanks.

32:56.567 --> 32:58.933
I've already done that
once before.

33:01.034 --> 33:03.301
That's what makes you weak.

33:07.933 --> 33:10.367
No. That's what makes you great.

33:18.634 --> 33:21.200
Your dad wanted you
to have this.

34:02.034 --> 34:03.967
This is not good.

34:04.034 --> 34:06.134
I am definitely going
to be fired tomorrow.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.967
Big Mike, sir,

34:13.034 --> 34:15.400
what if I told you
there was another way?

34:15.467 --> 34:17.333
A way we could
save our jobs,

34:17.333 --> 34:18.699
be heroes...?

34:18.699 --> 34:19.831
Do tell, Barnes.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.400
Do tell.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.199
We burn the Buy More.

34:23.201 --> 34:25.668
Burn it down to the ground.

34:25.733 --> 34:27.233
Burn down what?!

34:27.234 --> 34:29.134
It would be my honor
to do that for you.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.433
That's it.

34:30.434 --> 34:32.634
I have had it with you two!

34:32.699 --> 34:35.833
You have brought me nothing
but pain and misery.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.167
You answering phones
that ain't ringing.

34:38.234 --> 34:40.766
And you- your singing voice
is a vocal felony.

34:40.833 --> 34:44.934
With that, good night,
good riddance,

34:45.034 --> 34:47.034
and good-bye!

34:48.601 --> 34:51.234
So none of these firemen
are real, huh?

34:51.301 --> 34:52.966
CIA cleaners looking
for Shaw's detonator.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.600
By the way,
good work today.

34:54.601 --> 34:56.568
Takes something special
to break your thumbs.

34:56.634 --> 34:58.466
Come on. It's nothing.
They're just thumbs.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.133
What any good partner
would do. Yeah.

35:00.134 --> 35:02.201
Will you tell Beckman of
my exploits? It depends.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.167
Why do you have my
daughter's phone number?

35:04.201 --> 35:06.167
Oh.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.833
Aah. Aah. Aah.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.601
Oh.

35:12.668 --> 35:14.568
Sarah, I told Ellie that I'd
quit after we stop the Ring,

35:16.601 --> 35:18.733
and I meant it.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.700
I can't lie to her.

35:22.833 --> 35:25.733
You think you could
love a regular guy?

35:25.800 --> 35:28.301
Well, I fell in love
with a regular guy.

35:30.034 --> 35:32.367
Hey!

35:32.434 --> 35:34.166
Found the detonator.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.400
Found the
detonator, Colonel.

35:35.401 --> 35:37.900
Am I on some hero
streak or what?

35:37.967 --> 35:39.900
Man, when you're hot, you're
hot. Careful with that, Grimes.

35:39.967 --> 35:42.134
Now will you tell Beckman
of my exploits?

35:42.201 --> 35:44.033
Okay? How I broke
my thumbs and how

35:44.034 --> 35:45.732
I found the detonator.
He's gonna drop it.

35:45.733 --> 35:47.633
And how I...
dropped it.

35:48.434 --> 35:50.800
I can't believe
I just did that.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.033
Bombs are armed, everybody!

35:53.034 --> 35:54.166
Run!

35:54.167 --> 35:55.567
I'm-I'm so sorry, everybody.

35:55.568 --> 35:57.468
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.

35:59.201 --> 36:00.699
Everybody, get back! Get back!

36:00.700 --> 36:02.600
Get back!
Hit the deck!

36:13.534 --> 36:15.467
Did we do that?

36:15.534 --> 36:17.534
I don't know.

36:17.601 --> 36:19.733
Start the van.
All clear!

36:19.800 --> 36:22.167
Everyone please exit
the area in a calm

36:22.234 --> 36:24.134
and orderly fashion.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.033
Sweet lord, they did it.

36:37.034 --> 36:38.832
They actually did it.

36:38.833 --> 36:41.134
Those crazy nerds
blew up the freakin' Buy More.

36:41.201 --> 36:42.832
<i>In our top story</i>

36:42.833 --> 36:44.500
tonight, it's been 24 hours

36:44.501 --> 36:46.800
since the Burbank Buy More
burned to the ground,

36:46.867 --> 36:48.833
and the police have had no luck

36:48.900 --> 36:51.167
in apprehending
the two lead suspects.

36:51.234 --> 36:53.099
<i>These two men are on the run</i>

36:53.100 --> 36:55.601
<i>and considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

36:55.668 --> 36:57.400
If you encounter
these fugitives,

36:57.401 --> 37:00.067
please call your
local authorities immediately.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.034
And in other...

37:02.700 --> 37:04.033
Thanks, buddy.

37:04.034 --> 37:05.533
Of course.

37:05.534 --> 37:07.568
Um...

37:07.634 --> 37:10.733
We didn't always think
he was the greatest family man,

37:10.800 --> 37:12.600
but we know

37:12.601 --> 37:15.833
that there was nothing more
important to him than family.

37:20.234 --> 37:22.301
To a great man,

37:22.367 --> 37:24.267
Stephen J. Bartowski.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.934
To Dad.

37:30.334 --> 37:32.234
Mm.

37:44.967 --> 37:46.300
Hi.
Hi.

37:46.301 --> 37:48.201
I hope I didn't miss dinner.

37:48.234 --> 37:50.401
No. No. come in,
please. Welcome to

37:50.467 --> 37:52.467
La Casa de Bartowski.

37:52.534 --> 37:54.166
Uh, Alex,
this is my sister Ellie.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.300
Hi.

37:55.301 --> 37:56.500
And that's Devon,

37:56.501 --> 37:58.501
her-her husband
back there.

38:01.501 --> 38:03.501
Just so glad you came.

38:03.568 --> 38:05.300
Me, too.

38:05.301 --> 38:06.567
Oh.

38:06.568 --> 38:08.468
Okay.

38:14.267 --> 38:15.633
Well,

38:15.634 --> 38:16.966
he's not much
of a hugger,

38:16.967 --> 38:18.200
but baby steps, right?

38:18.201 --> 38:19.766
I'm glad to see you,

38:19.767 --> 38:21.266
Alex. I, too,

38:21.267 --> 38:22.866
am glad that you
came... Step aside.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.100
Before I break the rest
of your fingers. Hmm?

38:25.167 --> 38:27.067
Or you blow up
the apartment.

38:27.067 --> 38:29.234
Oh, that's low, Casey.
Okay? It was an accident.

38:29.301 --> 38:30.799
Chuck it was
an accident.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.533
I couldn't grip anything.
I know. I know it was...

38:32.534 --> 38:33.832
I know it was
an accident, buddy.

38:33.833 --> 38:37.634
So... Chuck... are
you done for real?

38:41.067 --> 38:44.167
Uh, I told Beckman
that I'm out.

38:44.234 --> 38:47.401
I mean, after all, I did
get her her job back, and

38:47.467 --> 38:49.434
simultaneously saved
multiple branches

38:49.501 --> 38:51.601
of the United States government,
so she accepted.

38:51.668 --> 38:54.067
I'm a civilian
just like you.

38:54.134 --> 38:56.067
Really?

38:56.134 --> 38:57.366
You were right, sis.

38:57.367 --> 38:59.267
There's nothing more important
than family.

39:02.034 --> 39:03.732
Love you.

39:03.733 --> 39:05.867
I love you, too.

39:34.934 --> 39:37.034
Oh, boy.

39:45.733 --> 39:47.934
Hello, Chuck.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.633
If you're seeing this,

39:49.634 --> 39:52.634
that means I wasn't able to stop
this message from sending.

39:52.700 --> 39:56.000
which also means I'm dead.

39:56.067 --> 39:59.800
I want to say about that, um,

39:59.867 --> 40:01.867
I- I'm sorry and-and...

40:03.634 --> 40:07.201
Well, I hope you and your sister
know how much I love you.

40:09.833 --> 40:12.401
Loved you.

40:12.467 --> 40:15.467
Now I need you
to do something for me,

40:15.534 --> 40:16.766
Charles.

40:16.767 --> 40:17.933
Something secret.

40:17.934 --> 40:19.834
You better get a pen.

40:22.434 --> 40:25.167
<i>I never wanted you
to be a spy.</i>

40:25.234 --> 40:27.334
<i>I knew how dangerous
this world is,</i>

40:27.401 --> 40:29.967
<i>what it does
to the people in it.</i>

40:30.034 --> 40:32.767
<i>Boy, do I know that.</i>

40:32.833 --> 40:36.601
<i>That's why I kept something
from you,</i>

40:36.668 --> 40:40.000
<i>something about me,
about Orion.</i>

40:40.067 --> 40:42.100
Charles, I'll be back
in a second.

40:42.167 --> 40:44.067
Hey, Dad.

40:50.067 --> 40:53.167
<i>I've been a spy
for the last 20 years,</i>

40:53.234 --> 40:55.167
<i>working for myself,</i>

40:55.234 --> 40:59.134
<i>doing things
governments are afraid to do.</i>

41:06.867 --> 41:09.100
<i>Maybe being a spy is...</i>

41:09.167 --> 41:11.234
<i>is in our blood,</i>

41:11.301 --> 41:14.301
<i>and... maybe
I should have told you...</i>

41:14.367 --> 41:16.334
<i>all of this long ago,</i>

41:16.401 --> 41:18.601
<i>but</i>

41:18.668 --> 41:20.601
<i>Chuck,</i>

41:20.668 --> 41:23.833
<i>your story-
it's only just beginning.</i>

41:26.234 --> 41:29.000
<i>It's time you know the truth
about my work</i>

41:29.067 --> 41:32.767
<i>and about the people
who tried to destroy me</i>

41:32.833 --> 41:34.633
<i>because if I'm gone,</i>

41:34.634 --> 41:37.800
<i>then you're not safe
from them anymore,</i>

41:37.867 --> 41:40.767
<i>and neither is Ellie.</i>

41:42.067 --> 41:44.134
<i>These people-
they-they are...</i>

41:44.201 --> 41:48.534
<i>They are ruthless
and cunning and...</i>

41:51.134 --> 41:53.034
<i>Chuck, it's-it's time
you learned</i>

41:53.100 --> 41:55.000
<i>about your family.</i>

41:58.867 --> 42:00.833
<i>Because...</i>

42:02.467 --> 42:05.334
<i>I did it all for her.</i>

42:07.301 --> 42:09.234
Yes.

42:09.301 --> 42:11.767
MAN
We're going to have to move you.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.833
Now.

42:15.668 --> 42:17.900
Mom?
